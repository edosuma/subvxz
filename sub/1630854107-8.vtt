WEBVTT

00:15.149 --> 00:18.252
Nice to meet you, Admiral Stock.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.587
Yo, Admiral!

00:19.687 --> 00:22.456
How you doing?

00:22.556 --> 00:25.226
Looking good, Admiral Stock.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.328
Hey, Admiral?

00:27.428 --> 00:29.963
Big fan.

00:30.064 --> 00:32.100
Ah, something's missing.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.001
What is it?

00:35.203 --> 00:37.071
What is missing?

00:43.444 --> 00:45.679
Official.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.850
Now that's
what I'm talking about.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.922
Admiral. NCIS.

00:55.022 --> 00:57.525
At your service.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.496
Have fun.
MAN (over P.A.):
Welcome to the annual

01:35.596 --> 01:37.898
Anacostia Turkey Trot.

01:37.998 --> 01:40.534
Runners, please check in
at the registration desk

01:40.634 --> 01:43.471
to get your numbers.

01:45.606 --> 01:46.707
Tell you,
with a little more notice,

01:46.807 --> 01:48.476
I might've actually
trained for this.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.511
And I would've sprung
for a new knee.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.280
It's a 5K run, guys.
It's just three miles.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.682
3.1.
It's the point-one that'll
kill you.

01:54.782 --> 01:57.418
Hey, uh, we using
badges here?

01:57.518 --> 01:59.052
Well, we are semi-undercover,

01:59.153 --> 02:01.054
backup security
for the admiral, so...

02:01.155 --> 02:03.491
So "we don't need
no stinking badges," then.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.593
Oh, you finally got
to say it. Congrats.

02:05.693 --> 02:06.760
Good morning, Agents.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.095
Admiral Stock. Morning.

02:08.196 --> 02:09.363
I trust you've been briefed
by my right hand,

02:09.463 --> 02:10.598
Lieutenant Sara Giles?

02:10.698 --> 02:11.865
Briefed and re-briefed, yeah.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.100
Again, we appreciate
you spending

02:13.201 --> 02:14.168
your holiday
morning with us.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.436
And my apologies

02:15.536 --> 02:16.637
for the humble
turnout so far.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.606
Apparently, Fergie is
grand marshaling

02:18.706 --> 02:20.241
another Turkey Trot
across town,

02:20.341 --> 02:21.909
and who can compete
with that?

02:22.009 --> 02:23.477
What?! Fergie,
like <i>Fergie</i> Fergie?

02:23.577 --> 02:26.214
Uh, no apologies
necessary, Admiral.

02:26.314 --> 02:29.149
Uh, we're being summoned to
the giant turkey, Admiral.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.485
Now there's a sentence
you don't hear every day.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.521
Care to meet
the event committee?

02:33.621 --> 02:35.589
Lead the way.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.991
Fergie.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.595
She is one cool admiral. Yeah.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.397
She's no Fergalicious though.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.333
Hey, guys.

02:45.433 --> 02:47.268
Ah, we found you.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.036
How fun is this?

02:49.136 --> 02:51.205
Great, I thought there'd be a
little more people here though.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.674
Well, they're all across town,
frankly, where I should be.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.576
Nick is experiencing
a little FOMO.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.711
So what do you say
we finish running this race,

02:57.811 --> 03:00.147
and then we can just keep
running over to Fergie's 5K.

03:00.248 --> 03:02.616
Are you still trying to get
out of seeing your sister?

03:02.716 --> 03:04.151
And did you just say "Fergie"?

03:04.252 --> 03:06.086
My sister's renting a place
in town for the month.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.456
And she's gonna host
a Thanksgiving lunch, so...

03:08.556 --> 03:10.291
They don't exactly get along.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.859
Well, you know,
since Kasie just

03:11.959 --> 03:13.561
recently broke up
with Piper...

03:13.661 --> 03:15.829
But we're still friends,
you know, for the kids.

03:15.929 --> 03:19.066
She's gonna run a little
sisterly interference.

03:19.166 --> 03:22.270
NCIS, coming through. Excuse me.
Look at this guy.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.671
NCIS. Coming through.

03:23.771 --> 03:24.772
Nice fake hat.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.607
NCIS coming through, excuse me.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.976
Anybody we know?
Not even a little bit.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.946
Hey! How you doing?

03:33.046 --> 03:34.282
I'm doing fine.

03:34.382 --> 03:35.616
Now excuse me.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.285
Uh, NCIS, yeah?

03:37.385 --> 03:39.320
That's right.
Wow, no kidding.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.654
I hear that's a great gig.
You, uh,

03:40.754 --> 03:42.323
you work out
of the Springfield office?

03:42.423 --> 03:44.124
Sure do. Now if you don't mind,

03:44.224 --> 03:45.626
I'm on official business.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.328
Well, it'd probably be
even more official if, uh,

03:47.428 --> 03:49.530
NCIS had a Springfield office.

03:50.298 --> 03:51.699
NCIS.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.101
And you are?

03:54.201 --> 03:55.403
I'm, I'm, uh...

03:55.503 --> 03:57.605
I'm so sorry.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.573
Good morning, Turkey Trotters.

03:59.673 --> 04:00.974
All right, listen, Mr. Sorry,

04:01.074 --> 04:02.843
let's have this conversation
back there. Okay?

04:02.943 --> 04:04.378
Um...
Here we go, here we go.
Just turn around.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.814
It's an honor to serve
as your grand marshal today.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.517
As we embark on this small test
of endurance...
Here we go, right there.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.852
We're just gonna take a little
look. You don't mind, do you?

04:11.952 --> 04:13.521
No weapons. He's clean.

04:13.621 --> 04:16.123
Care to explain why you're
impersonating a federal agent?

04:16.223 --> 04:17.925
I-I wasn't impersonating.

04:18.025 --> 04:20.861
I was just trying
to meet the admiral.

04:20.961 --> 04:23.731
I've been a big fan,
since my Navy days.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.499
I mean, just look at her.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.468
I'm being told
we're about to start.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.036
Incredible, isn't she?

04:29.136 --> 04:30.338
That she is.

04:30.438 --> 04:31.739
And this is as close
as you're gonna get.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.006
What?
Yeah, you're gonna stay

04:33.106 --> 04:34.942
right here, Agent Bob, with me

04:35.042 --> 04:37.144
and the very real
Special Agent McGee.

04:37.244 --> 04:38.779
And you two can go
have a nice run.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.914
We got it.
Please, let me
just say hello.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.783
Uh, maybe another time.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.952
Please.
Okay, just stay right here.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.821
Please, l-let me
just get a few selfies with her.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.089
Well, if you want selfies,
you're gonna have

04:49.189 --> 04:50.424
to take them
from here, okay, so...

04:53.661 --> 04:55.496
Everybody, ready?

04:55.596 --> 04:57.398
On your mark...

04:57.498 --> 04:58.966
All right, whatever.

05:00.368 --> 05:03.103
Get set...

05:04.004 --> 05:05.373
Go!

05:21.054 --> 05:23.190
I didn't plant any bomb.

05:23.290 --> 05:24.992
Let's see,
a dishonorably discharged,

05:25.092 --> 05:28.061
unemployed car salesman
with a rap sheet.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.163
Kind of makes it
hard to believe you, Bob.

05:30.263 --> 05:31.932
I admit, I've made
some bad decisions.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.834
Like impersonating
a federal agent to get close

05:33.934 --> 05:36.637
to Admiral Stock
right before she's blown up?

05:36.737 --> 05:38.205
If I had known she
was gonna blow up,

05:38.305 --> 05:39.707
why would I be trying
to get close?

05:39.807 --> 05:42.242
McGEE: To save her life.
It's called Hero Syndrome.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.445
You set a fire to put it out. No.

05:44.545 --> 05:46.947
You guys have my phone.
Check the pictures.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.949
Your phone, this one?

05:49.049 --> 05:50.350
That you conveniently
landed on?

05:50.451 --> 05:52.085
By the way,
we're checking that for apps

05:52.185 --> 05:53.387
that can remotely
detonate a bomb.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.088
Look, all I wanted was

05:55.188 --> 05:56.824
a few shots
with the woman I love.

05:56.924 --> 05:59.393
This is just so crazy.
No way I'd ever
risk hurting her!

05:59.493 --> 06:01.261
I swear I have...
Least of all by
planting a bomb!

06:01.361 --> 06:03.564
...never seen
this man in my life.

06:03.664 --> 06:06.467
Unfortunately, he saw you
during the time that he served.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.301
Oh, thank God.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.237
Lieutenant Giles is okay.

06:10.337 --> 06:11.939
I have to get back
to the hospital.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.607
Okay, I can drive you over now.
And while you're gone,

06:13.707 --> 06:15.208
I'll keep working
on the surveillance photos

06:15.308 --> 06:16.844
to figure out
how that bomb was planted.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.479
It wasn't a bomb.

06:18.579 --> 06:19.847
What?

06:19.947 --> 06:21.348
Kasie had what was left
of the turkey float

06:21.449 --> 06:23.183
towed into the evidence garage.
Take a look.

06:23.283 --> 06:25.218
There was
a gas-powered generator

06:25.318 --> 06:27.555
underneath the float,
with what is very clearly

06:27.655 --> 06:30.257
a bullet hole through
its gas tank.

06:30.357 --> 06:32.125
Wait a second, you're saying

06:32.225 --> 06:34.194
someone took a shot
at the admiral?

06:34.294 --> 06:35.395
And hit the generator instead.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.730
Well, if that's the case,

06:36.830 --> 06:38.932
then that someone
clearly wasn't Bob.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.400
Who the hell was it then?

06:45.372 --> 06:47.608
Got the bullet.
A 45-caliber

06:47.708 --> 06:49.510
with striations
that indicate

06:49.610 --> 06:51.344
this baby was shot
through a silencer.

06:51.445 --> 06:54.181
And perfectly timed with
the admiral's starter's pistol.

06:54.281 --> 06:55.949
Well, she gave
the shooter a countdown.

06:56.049 --> 06:59.186
No security cam photos from
the parks department just yet.

06:59.286 --> 07:01.522
Why the hell not?
They're working with
a skeleton crew just like us.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.356
Would a camera have
even caught the shooting?

07:03.457 --> 07:05.292
They could've fired
from really far away.

07:05.392 --> 07:07.227
Not through a silencer.
Had to be close range.

07:07.327 --> 07:09.663
Then we need photos. Yeah.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.632
All right, let's start combing
social media. A giant exploding

07:11.732 --> 07:13.433
turkey's got
to be trending by now.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.435
Oh, darn.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.538
Uh, my sister apparently

07:17.638 --> 07:20.007
has "a big surprise"
awaiting me at lunch.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.675
So bummed to have to cancel.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.077
"Cancel"?
What about the surprise?

07:24.177 --> 07:25.879
Knowing Robin, it could be
anything from serving us

07:25.979 --> 07:28.616
Tofurky for lunch
to yet another new fiancé.

07:28.716 --> 07:31.118
Either way, hate
to miss it, but...

07:31.218 --> 07:33.587
Wait, wait, stop,
just don't cancel.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.388
Uh, but we have a case.

07:35.489 --> 07:36.524
Just go, family first.

07:36.624 --> 07:37.991
The rest of us
have a few hours

07:38.091 --> 07:39.727
before our dinner plans.
Okay?

07:39.827 --> 07:41.328
Yeah, Jess, it's not like
we need the whole team

07:41.428 --> 07:42.429
to search the Internet.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.331
But...
No buts.

07:44.431 --> 07:46.233
Just go see your sister.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.401
You should go, Jess.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.337
This will be good
for both of you.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.575
Ugh...

07:54.675 --> 07:57.645
♪ Let's get
this party started, okay? ♪

07:57.745 --> 07:59.680
Okay.
Let's go, girl.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.649
Hey!

08:02.716 --> 08:05.185
Keep walking like that and we
should be there by Christmas.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.354
Who's in a rush?

08:07.454 --> 08:08.556
Hey, you know what?

08:08.656 --> 08:10.591
It is going
to be okay because I...

08:10.691 --> 08:12.425
take my job
as peacemaker very seriously.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.728
So I actually brought
a secret weapon.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.997
Oh, your mom's mac-n-cheese?
Uh-huh.

08:17.097 --> 08:19.633
It is so decadent
that after three bites,

08:19.733 --> 08:21.735
everybody's too tired
to argue, okay?

08:21.835 --> 08:25.405
30 minutes in the oven,
and world peace is assured.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.741
We call it
"Mac-N-Cheezus."

08:27.841 --> 08:30.544
So, listen, I may
have oversold this.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.580
Yes, my sister and I fight,

08:32.680 --> 08:35.348
but not as bad as we used to.
Oh, no, I get it.

08:35.448 --> 08:36.884
There was even a time
when our older brother

08:36.984 --> 08:39.720
wouldn't let us at the same
family function together.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.689
Oh... that's bad.

08:41.789 --> 08:44.291
Well, it's just because
Robin wouldn't grew up

08:44.391 --> 08:46.126
and I had to be
the third parent.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.562
What about your actual parents?

08:48.662 --> 08:51.565
I took Dad in the divorce,
and she took Mom.

08:51.665 --> 08:54.234
Oh.
Because we are always opposites.

08:54.334 --> 08:55.669
I am levelheaded.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.905
And she is a free spirit. I say,

08:58.005 --> 08:59.106
"Red," she says, "Blue."

08:59.206 --> 09:00.608
Okay, tell you what.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.610
If you need backup
in there,

09:02.710 --> 09:04.377
let's have a code word.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.714
Cheezus?
Perfect.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.417
You got this.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.355
Ah, Jess!
Yeah!

09:15.455 --> 09:17.625
It's so good to see you.

09:17.725 --> 09:18.692
So good to see you.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.193
Wait, you're wearing that?

09:20.293 --> 09:22.195
Cheezus.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.664
Hi, I'm Kasie.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.766
So nice to meet you, Kase.
Can I call you Kase?

09:25.866 --> 09:28.401
Sure. I brought mac-and-cheese.
Where's the oven?

09:28.501 --> 09:31.672
Ah, the oven.
Funny story about that.

09:34.608 --> 09:35.843
Hey, nice place.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.911
Thank you so much
for having us.

09:38.011 --> 09:40.614
Ah, I love the smell
of Thanksgiving.

09:40.714 --> 09:43.684
It smells like, um...

09:44.985 --> 09:46.386
...nothing.

09:46.486 --> 09:48.221
It smells like nothing.
Yeah, well,

09:48.321 --> 09:50.290
that's the funny story,
but other than the oven

09:50.390 --> 09:53.360
and the microwave not working,
this rental is amazing.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.763
So much for world peace.
No sweat.

09:55.863 --> 09:57.665
I ordered in, the food
will be here in no time.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.432
Is that the "surprise"?

09:59.532 --> 10:01.601
What's that supposed to mean?

10:01.702 --> 10:03.470
Hey, I have an idea.

10:03.570 --> 10:06.473
How about you two pop
onto the couch,

10:06.573 --> 10:08.709
I will pop my mac-n-cheese
into the fridge,

10:08.809 --> 10:12.345
and we can pop open a bottle
of what Jess brought.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.782
Eh? Pinot, anyone?

10:16.183 --> 10:18.351
We'll start with that one,
that's good.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.087
Yeah, that's...

10:20.187 --> 10:22.522
Ah, that's good.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.725
Yeah, I know it's a holiday.

10:24.825 --> 10:27.060
But since, uh,
someone tried to blow up

10:27.160 --> 10:29.396
a Navy admiral
in one of your parks,

10:29.496 --> 10:31.631
maybe have someone
call us back or at least

10:31.732 --> 10:34.234
send us some
security cam photos?

10:34.334 --> 10:35.502
Okay? Thank you.

10:35.602 --> 10:37.771
Oh, and, uh, happy Thanksgiving.

10:37.871 --> 10:41.141
Still no access to traffic cams
outside the park, either.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.610
And no luck on social media,
either. Just lots of selfies

10:43.711 --> 10:45.846
with hashtags like, uh,
"TurkeyBomb,"

10:45.946 --> 10:47.380
"BirdBlast."

10:47.480 --> 10:48.816
No shooter.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.684
Whoa, hang on, Fake Agent Bob's

10:50.784 --> 10:53.486
broken cell phone finally
booted up, gave us some photos.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.388
Look at this one.

10:55.488 --> 10:59.259
Oh, he caught
that explosion in 4K.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.528
No, look closer.

11:01.628 --> 11:04.064
Green hoodie.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.532
He's carrying a gun.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.103
And a clear shot of his face.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.539
Facial rec, here we come.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.246
I'd bet money
Jimmy wears glasses.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.915
How'd you know?
Jessica's always had
a thing for eyewear.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.651
She thought the Monopoly
Man's monocle was so hot.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.288
Oh, you think that's funny?

11:28.388 --> 11:30.490
Hey, remember the time
when you got stood up for prom?

11:32.826 --> 11:35.162
What the hell, Jess?

11:35.262 --> 11:36.463
Oh, I thought we were telling

11:36.563 --> 11:37.831
embarrassing stories
about each other.

11:37.931 --> 11:40.267
Want to guess Jessica's
family nickname?

11:40.367 --> 11:42.102
I don't know, do I?

11:42.202 --> 11:43.536
No, you do not.

11:43.636 --> 11:46.106
"Wetsica," because
she used to pee the bed

11:46.206 --> 11:47.540
and then blame it on me.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.609
Okay, I was a kid. Hey, Robin?

11:52.479 --> 11:54.915
I'm sorry, you have
a best friend,

11:55.015 --> 11:56.784
Miss I Don't Get
Close to Anybody?

11:56.884 --> 11:58.752
Wait, I'm your best friend?

11:58.852 --> 12:00.788
I get close to plenty of people.
And why do you think

12:00.888 --> 12:03.023
I was saying that to you
in Mandarin? Give a guess.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.624
Would you just chill?
I'm sorry I'm not

12:04.724 --> 12:06.426
a bilingual show-off
like some people.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.628
The truth is, I understand it
better than I speak it.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.864
So, Robin...

12:10.964 --> 12:13.133
I hear you make
your own soaps.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.868
That's a neat business.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.037
Well, not anymore.
People are so cheap.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.939
They think that 30 bucks
is too much for soap.

12:19.039 --> 12:22.843
But I'm in town because
I started a new business.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.945
Ooh!

12:25.045 --> 12:26.479
Yo, what are you doing?

12:26.579 --> 12:27.747
I get close to people.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.516
Well, of course you do.
Now just...

12:29.616 --> 12:30.851
let it go, bestie.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.820
I just finished my training

12:32.920 --> 12:34.988
as an energy healer.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.124
"Robin Knight,

12:37.224 --> 12:38.959
Energy EMT."

12:39.059 --> 12:40.894
Consider me
a spiritual lifesaver.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.695
Certified
to align chakras,

12:42.796 --> 12:45.065
clean auras,
open third eyes...

12:45.165 --> 12:46.433
Ooh.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.069
Am I picking up

12:49.169 --> 12:50.770
on some
negative energy, Jess?

12:50.871 --> 12:53.006
Give me a call, I'll give
you the family discount.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.508
And you know what, you didn't
have to wear that watch

12:55.608 --> 12:57.444
for extra points
with me or whatever.

12:57.544 --> 12:58.678
I wear this every day.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.347
Sure.
Mm.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.648
No, she really does.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.285
Oh, my God, that's him.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.254
That's who?
I met a guy.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.189
You are gonna love him.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.393
Brace yourself because

13:13.493 --> 13:14.727
her taste in men
runs the gamut

13:14.828 --> 13:16.463
between unemployed
and puppeteer.

13:16.563 --> 13:19.732
You haven't even met him yet,
and you already don't like him.

13:19.833 --> 13:22.135
Okay, fine. I will try.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.943
Jess, Kase.

13:31.845 --> 13:34.647
This is Charlie. Hi.

13:34.747 --> 13:37.050
Nice to meet you both.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.551
Nice to meet you.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.221
Hi. Yes, here we go, come on.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.290
Ah, nice to meet you.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.941
Oh, uh, this dress?

14:18.558 --> 14:20.260
Buzzing like a beehive
over here.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.162
Come on, no phones.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.696
It's Thanksgiving.

14:23.796 --> 14:24.932
I'm sorry, you're right.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.233
Uh, no, she's not right.

14:26.333 --> 14:27.767
These-these are work texts.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.502
Work, shmerk.
I'm sure CSI will survive

14:29.602 --> 14:31.004
a couple hours without you.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.306
I thought it was NCIS.

14:33.406 --> 14:36.143
Mm, it is. We get that a lot.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.611
Cool gig. What's that like?

14:38.711 --> 14:40.680
Oh, we don't have to talk
about her boring job, babe.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.815
Uh, why don't you get
to know Charlie, Jess?

14:42.916 --> 14:44.851
Yeah, that's...

14:44.952 --> 14:47.354
that's a great idea, um...

14:49.289 --> 14:51.391
What's up?

14:54.494 --> 14:57.264
Maybe work is distracting.

14:57.364 --> 15:00.000
Um, here's what my family
does on holidays.

15:00.100 --> 15:03.136
We... turn off

15:03.236 --> 15:05.405
our phones and...

15:05.505 --> 15:07.174
collect them together,

15:07.274 --> 15:09.642
so nobody's distracted.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.946
That's a great idea, babe.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.847
And...

15:14.948 --> 15:16.683
I can't wait
to meet your family.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.990
Mm.
Oh.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.357
Here, okay.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.860
I feel lighter already.

15:27.961 --> 15:30.530
Uh, I don't know, what if
there's a break in the case?

15:30.630 --> 15:32.799
Ooh, without
their most special agent

15:32.899 --> 15:35.768
and their very best
forensic scientist?

15:36.769 --> 15:38.438
Typical.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.641
Okay, I can see

15:41.741 --> 15:43.910
this is my fault.
What? No.

15:44.011 --> 15:46.346
It's not.
Yes, yes, it is.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.715
I'm, I'm an eager beaver.

15:48.815 --> 15:51.551
Way too excited
to meet your sister.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.554
So I-I came off
a little strong.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.623
So if this is
too much pressure,

15:56.723 --> 15:58.758
to do this over a holiday meal,

15:58.858 --> 15:59.993
I can go.

16:00.093 --> 16:02.162
We can try this again
another time.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.897
No. Jess wants you to stay, right?

16:07.400 --> 16:09.069
No-- yes, of course.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.870
You should, you should stay.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.677
Okay, if you insist.

16:20.047 --> 16:22.282
Okay.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.354
Yay.

16:27.454 --> 16:29.422
Thank you.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.891
I'm gonna pop open
a fresh bottle.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.360
Oh, hey, make it two.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.400
I guess I'll take this
as a positive sign

16:40.500 --> 16:41.868
that they're at least talking.

16:41.968 --> 16:44.371
Look at this.
"My sister's
latest incarnation."

16:44.471 --> 16:47.207
Apparently, Robin
changes dream careers

16:47.307 --> 16:48.675
like you and I change our socks.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.677
I got a cousin like that.
Actually makes me glad

16:50.777 --> 16:52.779
I'm avoiding
all that family drama this year.

16:52.879 --> 16:54.581
Oh, that's right, you guys
are headed to Vance's place?

16:54.681 --> 16:56.449
Mm-hmm.
No drunk uncles
in that family.

16:56.549 --> 16:57.750
Well, fingers crossed.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.319
I don't know,
it's funny how a, uh,

16:59.419 --> 17:00.953
holiday based on gratitude
can bring out

17:01.054 --> 17:02.689
the worst in people sometimes,
you know?

17:02.789 --> 17:04.124
I'm actually fine with the fact

17:04.224 --> 17:06.326
that my in-laws aren't ready
to meet Jess.

17:06.426 --> 17:07.727
Conflict

17:07.827 --> 17:09.729
is like a default setting
for some people.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.564
Oh, like your father-in-law?
Yeah.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.900
Yeah, good old Ed.
Although, to be fair,

17:14.000 --> 17:17.504
he's actually been a lot nicer
to me since Breena died.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.407
I don't know why
that hurts more.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.942
Yeah, it's-it's too bad
that it takes a loss

17:23.042 --> 17:25.312
like that for us
to realize what matters.

17:27.514 --> 17:28.881
Oh, we got a hit?

17:28.981 --> 17:30.750
Yeah, it's not from our
criminal files though.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.752
It's from the TSA database.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.621
Charles Samuels,

17:34.721 --> 17:37.324
airport security officer,
currently on unpaid leave.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.058
We have his
last known address.

17:39.159 --> 17:42.061
All right, text it to me.
Yeah, I'll send it now.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.196
Uh, and thanks, McGee.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.432
Yeah? For, uh, for what?

17:45.532 --> 17:47.167
For, uh...

17:47.267 --> 17:50.103
I don't know. Everything?

17:56.576 --> 17:58.111
Hope you guys are hungry.

17:58.211 --> 17:59.379
It looks great, babe.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.481
Ooh, fancy sandwiches.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.049
Nothing says
traditional Thanksgiving

18:03.150 --> 18:04.784
quite like cold cuts.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.586
I'll have you know
these are turkey heroes.

18:06.686 --> 18:09.789
Not that I expect Jess
to appreciate anything I do.

18:10.957 --> 18:13.360
In New York, we call them subs.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.595
I've also heard grinders, hoagies...

18:15.695 --> 18:17.397
Where I'm from, they're wedges.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.366
You're from Yonkers?
You know Yonkers?

18:19.466 --> 18:21.834
Ha! I've got family
in Mount Vernon.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.070
And some of them
say wedges, too.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.575
Charlie, honey,
you're from New York?

18:28.675 --> 18:30.710
I always thought
you were Southern.

18:30.810 --> 18:33.546
Well, I am. I-I lived

18:33.646 --> 18:35.315
in Texas awhile,

18:35.415 --> 18:37.184
but I was born in New York.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.252
Don't worry, babe.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.087
Lucky for us,

18:41.188 --> 18:42.822
we have the rest of our lives

18:42.922 --> 18:44.591
to get to know
each other better.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.159
You bet we do, babe.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.394
And there it is.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.128
There what is?

18:49.229 --> 18:50.730
Ah, Robin's big surprise.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.132
Go ahead, spill it.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.507
We're engaged!

19:00.607 --> 19:02.542
Surprise!

19:03.443 --> 19:04.744
Wow, you called it.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.246
I know we've only
known each other two weeks.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.114
But we have been
inseparable since.

19:08.215 --> 19:10.383
And when the universe gives
you a gift like Charlie,

19:10.483 --> 19:12.252
who can say no?

19:12.352 --> 19:14.020
That's great.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.289
Right? Knight?

19:16.389 --> 19:18.024
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

19:19.426 --> 19:20.793
Jess, can you say something?

19:20.893 --> 19:23.162
What would you like me to say?

19:24.664 --> 19:26.833
Jess.
Look, I may have called it,

19:26.933 --> 19:29.436
but I still have to say,
I mean, you move fast,

19:29.536 --> 19:30.937
but two-weeks fast?

19:31.037 --> 19:34.073
I knew it was a bad idea
telling her like this.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.075
Maybe we should just eat.
Or you know what?

19:36.175 --> 19:39.011
Maybe Jessica should have my
back for just once in my life.

19:39.111 --> 19:41.080
Are you kidding me?
I never said anything

19:41.180 --> 19:43.216
about your previous
four engagements.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.685
It's like you're like a serial
monogamist or something.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.354
Well, it's better
than a serial...

19:47.454 --> 19:49.689
non-ogamist, commitment-phobe.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.924
You know, I've been here a whole
month and still haven't met

19:52.024 --> 19:54.527
your "special friend."
God forbid she say boyfriend.

19:54.627 --> 19:57.530
Stop fighting!

19:59.732 --> 20:02.869
Sorry to yell like that.

20:04.070 --> 20:07.106
I just hate seeing the two
of you fight like this.

20:08.241 --> 20:10.510
Especially 'cause of me.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.214
I know this is a shock.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.550
And yeah...

20:17.650 --> 20:21.087
we're moving fast, but...

20:21.187 --> 20:23.423
I...

20:23.523 --> 20:26.559
love your sister.

20:26.659 --> 20:29.061
Can't wait to get
to know her better.

20:29.161 --> 20:32.064
And I'd like to get
to know you, too,

20:32.164 --> 20:34.701
if you'd let me.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.742
I'd like that.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.911
Ah, me, too.
Now can we talk

20:45.011 --> 20:46.579
about something easy,
like politics?

20:48.548 --> 20:51.250
Actually, I'd like to hear more
about Jessica's job.

20:51.351 --> 20:54.421
Like... what's it called?

20:54.521 --> 20:55.522
The...?

20:55.622 --> 20:58.257
The REACT team?

20:59.225 --> 21:00.360
How do you know about that?

21:00.460 --> 21:01.761
Most people haven't heard of it.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.296
Robin told me
all about your job.

21:03.396 --> 21:04.597
I did?
Mm-hmm.

21:04.697 --> 21:05.898
Well, that's surprising,

21:05.998 --> 21:07.467
because Robin thinks
I work for CSI.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.101
That's because you never
tell me anything,

21:09.201 --> 21:10.937
just like that time
you went camping without me.

21:11.037 --> 21:13.840
Okay, really? Now?
I'm trying to make a point here.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.242
But besides that,
that was 20 years ago.

21:16.343 --> 21:17.810
How are you not over that?

21:17.910 --> 21:20.613
Because you weren't the one
who was left out.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.349
Okay, nobody left you out.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.083
Yes, you did.
No, we didn't.
We asked you to go.

21:24.183 --> 21:26.252
But you needed to go to
Misty's sleepover party...

21:26.353 --> 21:28.388
No, no. I'm sorry.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.056
"Misty's having
a birthday party..."
No, that's not...

21:30.156 --> 21:32.024
So, who'd you vote for?

21:32.124 --> 21:33.860
I didn't have
anything to do, Jess...

21:33.960 --> 21:34.994
Go.

21:35.094 --> 21:36.128
NCIS!

21:51.378 --> 21:52.812
Clear.

21:53.580 --> 21:54.847
McGEE:
Clear.

22:03.289 --> 22:04.557
Does this guy's
profile say anything

22:04.657 --> 22:06.158
about him having kids?

22:06.258 --> 22:07.860
Doesn't look like
a recent photo.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.896
Better chance he's one of them.

22:11.263 --> 22:13.165
I found something.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.301
It's not a weapon.

22:16.403 --> 22:17.704
I found a silencer.

22:17.804 --> 22:19.572
Huh. Bet he's still out there
with a gun.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.007
But why target the admiral?

22:21.107 --> 22:23.342
I mean, this guy wasn't even
in the military.

22:23.443 --> 22:24.644
No, but this guy was.

22:25.445 --> 22:28.415
"In Memory of Marine Sergeant
Joseph Samuels."

22:28.515 --> 22:29.682
Our guy's brother or cousin?

22:29.782 --> 22:31.451
Maybe the other kid
in the photo?

22:34.153 --> 22:35.655
Yeah, Jimmy,
you got all of us.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.256
Good. I'm gonna need all of you.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.391
Check your cells.

22:38.491 --> 22:39.892
Traffic cam photos
finally came in.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.661
I guess Parker's nasty message
did the trick.

22:41.761 --> 22:43.329
Not nasty, just firm.

22:43.430 --> 22:44.931
All right, what are we
looking at, Jimmy?

22:45.031 --> 22:46.599
The first photo
clearly shows our guy

22:46.699 --> 22:48.134
firing toward the admiral.

22:48.234 --> 22:49.636
Well, that's great.
We got him caught in the act.

22:49.736 --> 22:51.438
The second photo,
however, clearly shows

22:51.538 --> 22:53.305
that he was aiming
more towards the float

22:53.406 --> 22:54.607
below the admiral.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.676
Why would he shoot at the float?

22:57.710 --> 22:59.378
Blowing up its gas tank would be
a million-to-one shot.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.814
Well, I don't like the answer
and neither will you.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.182
Check the third photo.

23:04.984 --> 23:06.252
All right, look who's standing

23:06.352 --> 23:09.155
right between our shooter
and the float.

23:09.255 --> 23:10.356
Directly in the bullet's path.

23:10.457 --> 23:11.791
Was he shooting at Knight?

23:16.362 --> 23:17.964
I just think it's weird
that your new fiancé

23:18.064 --> 23:19.966
knows more about my job
than you do.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.134
I'll have you know,
it was Charlie's idea

23:22.234 --> 23:23.903
to even get together
for Thanksgiving

23:24.003 --> 23:25.472
just so he could come
and meet you.

23:25.572 --> 23:28.374
Which I appreciate, but
I still think it's too soon.

23:28.475 --> 23:29.776
Too soon for who?

23:29.876 --> 23:30.910
Just because you're afraid
of being loved,

23:31.010 --> 23:32.244
doesn't mean that I have to be.

23:32.344 --> 23:34.947
God, I swear
you are just like Mom.

23:36.616 --> 23:39.351
Should we go around the room,
say what we're thankful for?

23:39.452 --> 23:40.720
Uh...

23:40.820 --> 23:41.821
You know what,
I think it's time

23:41.921 --> 23:42.789
that we get back to the office.

23:42.889 --> 23:43.890
I'll start.

23:43.990 --> 23:45.191
You know what?

23:45.291 --> 23:46.292
Please don't take this personally...

23:46.392 --> 23:49.028
I'm... (scoffs) thankful

23:49.128 --> 23:51.097
to be here with you all.

23:51.197 --> 23:52.899
I really am.

23:52.999 --> 23:54.567
Especially...

23:54.667 --> 23:56.202
so I can ask you,

23:56.302 --> 23:59.205
what it's like to be
a hostage negotiator.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.509
Word to the wise,

24:02.609 --> 24:04.076
stick to the thankful part.

24:04.176 --> 24:06.479
Yeah, babe, stop.
I'm-I'm just curious.

24:06.579 --> 24:07.947
Like, have you ever

24:08.047 --> 24:10.850
lost anyone
in the line of duty?

24:11.651 --> 24:13.620
Dude, give it up.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.121
Mm, afraid I can't.

24:15.221 --> 24:18.958
Your whole REACT team
was killed, wasn't it?

24:19.058 --> 24:21.160
Okay, Kasie,
it's time that we go.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.429
No, please,
you can't go now.

24:30.269 --> 24:32.304
Holiday's just getting started.

24:42.181 --> 24:43.916
Sit down.

24:45.017 --> 24:46.085
Hands out.

24:51.357 --> 24:55.094
I said sit down.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.702
Close the blinds.

25:03.670 --> 25:04.937
I'm sure you all know the drill.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.475
Hands where I can see them.

25:13.980 --> 25:16.015
You didn't
know about this, did you?

25:16.115 --> 25:17.817
Of course not.
Then, what do you know?

25:17.917 --> 25:20.486
I know that the love of my life
was lying to me about...

25:22.689 --> 25:24.857
Was it everything?

25:27.426 --> 25:29.261
Okay, we need a plan.

25:29.361 --> 25:32.398
Man, I am so sick
of hearing that.

25:32.498 --> 25:35.467
You know, this is
my third "at gunpoint" situation

25:35.568 --> 25:37.103
in three years.

25:37.203 --> 25:38.605
Kasie, focus.

25:40.607 --> 25:41.941
You are cut off.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.375
Okay, Robin. Robin.

25:46.412 --> 25:48.447
Get your what? Your receipt?

25:48.547 --> 25:49.582
What?
What?

25:49.682 --> 25:52.351
No.

25:52.451 --> 25:54.821
Oh, your phone. Yes.

26:02.361 --> 26:03.830
What the hell?

26:05.264 --> 26:07.066
We said no phones.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.103
It's a holiday, remember?

26:12.571 --> 26:13.940
So, what's your plan, Charlie?

26:15.174 --> 26:16.408
Wait, let me guess.

26:16.508 --> 26:17.744
I already know
you're the one

26:17.844 --> 26:20.246
who fired that shot
this morning.

26:20.346 --> 26:21.781
How do you know that?

26:21.881 --> 26:24.483
Your gun is the same caliber
as the bullet I pulled

26:24.583 --> 26:26.218
from the float's generator.

26:26.318 --> 26:29.922
So I'm guessing you tried
to assassinate the admiral,

26:30.022 --> 26:33.059
somehow missed,
and now you want to kill us

26:33.159 --> 26:34.827
because we know too much.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.362
Impressive.

26:36.462 --> 26:39.398
And so close, but no.

26:39.498 --> 26:41.067
I did hit the generator,

26:41.167 --> 26:45.738
but it wasn't the admiral
I was shooting at.

26:46.538 --> 26:47.573
Me?

26:47.674 --> 26:48.941
No.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.142
No, that's crazy.

26:50.242 --> 26:53.045
It was my one shot at justice.

26:53.145 --> 26:55.547
Couldn't believe I missed.

26:55.648 --> 26:58.217
But now, I'm glad.

26:58.317 --> 27:01.954
Confronting you in person
is so much better.

27:02.054 --> 27:04.523
What justice
are you talking about?

27:04.623 --> 27:06.358
With all of your questioning,
I'm assuming

27:06.458 --> 27:07.593
it has to do with REACT.

27:07.694 --> 27:08.861
If it was about REACT,

27:08.961 --> 27:11.063
why on earth
would he be dating...

27:15.735 --> 27:17.636
You were dating me
to get to Jess.

27:17.737 --> 27:19.038
Hey.

27:21.173 --> 27:24.243
Not just for that,

27:24.343 --> 27:27.446
but I needed some way
to get ahold of her schedule.

27:27.546 --> 27:28.915
So you could kill her?

27:29.015 --> 27:31.884
So I could...

27:31.984 --> 27:34.721
get justice.

27:34.821 --> 27:37.924
You keep throwing that word
around, Charlie.

27:38.024 --> 27:41.994
What exactly did I do
to make you want justice?

27:45.798 --> 27:49.068
Does the name Joe Samuels

27:49.168 --> 27:51.871
mean anything to you?

27:59.879 --> 28:01.047
I can't get Jess or Kasie
on the cell phone.

28:01.147 --> 28:02.381
All right, I'll try
pinging them.

28:02.481 --> 28:03.382
Here's our dead Marine's
obituary.

28:03.482 --> 28:04.884
Wait, what dead Marine?

28:04.984 --> 28:07.119
We found a mass card
in the shooter's apartment.

28:07.219 --> 28:10.222
Born in the Bronx,
schooled at Westchester.

28:10.322 --> 28:12.258
Was part of
the all-county baseball team.

28:12.358 --> 28:13.760
Joined the Marines in 2010.

28:13.860 --> 28:15.061
Three tours in Afghanistan.

28:15.161 --> 28:16.395
Predeceased by his parents,

28:16.495 --> 28:17.596
survived by his only brother,

28:17.696 --> 28:19.698
Charles Samuels of Fairfax.

28:19.799 --> 28:20.900
I don't see
a cause of death.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.234
And no luck on their phones.

28:22.334 --> 28:23.803
Why would they turn off
their phones?

28:23.903 --> 28:26.505
Dude, you don't know
where Knight's sister lives?

28:26.605 --> 28:27.907
No. I know she has
a monthly rental

28:28.007 --> 28:29.776
through that
NightTripper website.

28:29.876 --> 28:31.443
It should be
under Robin Knight.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.012
Well, I can check the site,
but I'm gonna need more

28:33.112 --> 28:34.546
than a name
to find an address.

28:34.646 --> 28:36.182
Oh, actually, uh...

28:36.282 --> 28:38.184
Robin's business card...

28:38.284 --> 28:39.318
yes, it has her email address

28:39.418 --> 28:40.719
and her cell number
if that helps.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.021
It's a start. Text it to me.
All right.

28:42.121 --> 28:43.589
Here we go.
I got our cause of death.

28:43.689 --> 28:46.725
Marine Sergeant Samuels died
by suicide.

28:46.826 --> 28:49.128
"Despite the best efforts
of the NCIS

28:49.228 --> 28:52.832
REACT team to talk him off
the bridge in Baltimore."

28:52.932 --> 28:56.302
The REACT team.
That's our connection.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.937
According to our records,
the agent that was trying

28:58.037 --> 29:00.706
to talk him down was...

29:04.777 --> 29:06.245
We need to find her.

29:06.345 --> 29:07.413
I'm gonna go check her place.

29:07.513 --> 29:08.647
Torres, check Kasie's, too,

29:08.747 --> 29:10.549
in case they ended up there somehow.

29:10.649 --> 29:11.583
On it.

29:11.683 --> 29:14.120
McGee.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.288
Find the sister.

29:17.089 --> 29:19.158
Joe and I were on our own

29:19.258 --> 29:21.227
after Mom died.

29:22.028 --> 29:24.730
But no matter
how bad things got,

29:24.831 --> 29:28.334
Joe taught me to fight for good.

29:29.101 --> 29:32.571
But three straight combat tours later,

29:32.671 --> 29:35.307
and he came back different.

29:35.407 --> 29:40.112
Whatever he saw there,
it changed him.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.982
But still,

29:43.082 --> 29:45.351
every day,

29:45.451 --> 29:49.421
Joe fought to be happy.

29:49.521 --> 29:52.524
And he was.
I saw it.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.726
He was...

29:54.827 --> 29:57.363
he was happy,

29:57.463 --> 30:00.066
until you let him jump.

30:00.166 --> 30:02.801
That is the last thing
that I wanted.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.237
Well, you didn't stop him!

30:06.973 --> 30:08.841
If you had done your job,

30:08.941 --> 30:10.943
he would be here today.

30:11.043 --> 30:13.445
Hell, you don't even remember
who I'm talking about.

30:13.545 --> 30:15.181
Oh, I wish
that were true, Charlie.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.350
But I couldn't forget Joe
if I tried.

30:20.052 --> 30:22.788
We spent hours talking
on that bridge.

30:23.622 --> 30:25.491
About how
he didn't want his brother

30:25.591 --> 30:26.959
worrying about him,

30:27.059 --> 30:29.395
about how he didn't

30:29.495 --> 30:30.429
want you to know.

30:30.529 --> 30:31.864
Know what?

30:31.964 --> 30:33.933
How truly unhappy he was.

30:35.267 --> 30:37.069
No. No.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.038
How he couldn't hide it
from you anymore,

30:39.138 --> 30:40.839
and that
he'd already tried once,

30:40.940 --> 30:43.075
but the gun jammed.
You're lying.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.543
You didn't know my brother.

30:44.643 --> 30:47.379
You don't remember him!

30:47.479 --> 30:48.780
He called you Boots!

30:53.319 --> 30:55.187
He called you Boots.

30:56.355 --> 30:59.058
An inside joke
from when you were kids.

30:59.158 --> 31:01.961
And he talked about
how much he loved you.

31:03.662 --> 31:06.098
And about
how much pain he was in.

31:06.933 --> 31:09.035
That means nothing.

31:10.102 --> 31:13.472
Don't sit there
and pretend like you care.

31:14.806 --> 31:17.243
I don't have to pretend.

31:21.613 --> 31:23.916
I just want you to see.

31:24.951 --> 31:26.885
I'm just gonna show you.

31:40.466 --> 31:42.001
On this side,

31:42.101 --> 31:45.104
each initial stands
for somebody that I care about.

31:45.204 --> 31:46.472
L.O.,

31:46.572 --> 31:48.874
B.V., K.M.

31:48.975 --> 31:51.210
That's Ono,
Vargas and Madden.

31:51.310 --> 31:52.911
My REACT team.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.985
And these here...

32:04.090 --> 32:07.093
These are three other people
that I couldn't save.

32:09.095 --> 32:09.795
J.E.

32:09.895 --> 32:11.397
That's Jenny.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.966
She's a mother who lost
her son and her husband

32:14.066 --> 32:15.767
in the same week.

32:16.868 --> 32:19.305
R.B. That was Robert.

32:19.405 --> 32:23.409
He was a grandpa whose cancer
stopped responding to treatment.

32:23.509 --> 32:26.045
And this one, J.S.

32:26.145 --> 32:28.314
Charlie,
do you know who that is?

32:28.414 --> 32:29.615
That's Joe.

32:29.715 --> 32:32.284
Joe Samuels, your brother.

32:41.693 --> 32:45.297
So, you can believe whatever
it is that you need to believe.

32:46.365 --> 32:49.668
You can say that I failed,
that I am bad at my job,

32:49.768 --> 32:52.104
that it is all my fault,
but don't you ever accuse me

32:52.204 --> 32:54.973
of not caring or forgetting.

32:56.275 --> 32:57.609
Because there's nothing
that I can do

32:57.709 --> 32:59.278
to forget these people.

33:10.356 --> 33:11.823
There's no sign of them
at Jess's place.

33:11.923 --> 33:13.092
How about Kasie's?

33:13.192 --> 33:14.126
Same. Nick's headed
back here now.

33:14.226 --> 33:15.561
Any luck with NightTripper?

33:15.661 --> 33:16.828
If it wasn't for the holiday,
we might have

33:16.928 --> 33:18.130
a supervisor there to help us,

33:18.230 --> 33:19.531
but without a...
This is Special Agent Parker

33:19.631 --> 33:21.333
at NCIS.

33:21.433 --> 33:22.901
Again.

33:23.001 --> 33:24.403
Call me back, please.

33:25.204 --> 33:27.406
And Parker's back
to leaving nasty messages.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.007
Hey, I said please.

33:29.108 --> 33:31.410
But every judge in town is
too busy carving turkey

33:31.510 --> 33:32.978
to issue a warrant.

33:33.079 --> 33:34.580
Have we even tried
coming up with, uh,

33:34.680 --> 33:36.115
Robin's password for the site?

33:36.215 --> 33:37.716
Well, I've got
a password generator running,

33:37.816 --> 33:39.085
but, I mean, who knows?

33:39.185 --> 33:40.286
It could take days
to land on the right one.

33:40.386 --> 33:43.021
All right, what about,
uh, Jessica?

33:43.889 --> 33:45.524
"Jessica1"?

33:46.192 --> 33:48.026
You really think her password
is gonna be a sister

33:48.127 --> 33:49.261
she doesn't get along with?

33:49.361 --> 33:50.729
I think that
anything's worth trying.

33:50.829 --> 33:52.398
Okay, fine.

33:53.399 --> 33:55.567
No, no dice.
Let me try "Jessica2."

33:56.702 --> 33:57.803
"Jessica3"?

33:57.903 --> 33:59.571
Four?

33:59.671 --> 34:00.872
No.

34:00.972 --> 34:01.940
Any other ideas, guys?

34:02.040 --> 34:03.609
You know what?

34:03.709 --> 34:05.544
Try "Wetsica."

34:06.445 --> 34:07.413
Wets-a-what?

34:07.513 --> 34:10.149
W-E-T-S-I-C-A.

34:10.249 --> 34:12.318
It's a family nickname.

34:16.155 --> 34:17.523
Ooh. I'm in.

34:17.623 --> 34:18.624
Amazing.

34:18.724 --> 34:19.725
Got an address, too.

34:19.825 --> 34:20.826
It's a Thanksgiving miracle.

34:20.926 --> 34:22.060
Not yet.

34:22.161 --> 34:23.329
All right,
I'm gonna call Torres.

34:23.429 --> 34:24.796
Good. Have him meet us
over there.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.898
Let's go.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.636
I understand you are hurting, Charlie.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.806
But it is time
to put the gun down.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.208
You think
a few hours on a bridge

34:36.308 --> 34:38.910
is the same as a lifetime?

34:39.010 --> 34:41.280
I never said that.

34:41.380 --> 34:44.049
No one is immune to loss,
not Kasie,

34:44.150 --> 34:45.984
or Robin, or me.

34:46.752 --> 34:48.587
I understand.

34:52.291 --> 34:54.226
You can't.

34:55.261 --> 34:58.096
You can't understand,

34:58.197 --> 35:01.667
because Joe wasn't your brother.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.574
But maybe now you will.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.542
No!

35:18.950 --> 35:21.019
You NCIS?
Pete the super?

35:21.119 --> 35:22.854
We just heard a gunshot,
end of the hall, last door down.

35:22.954 --> 35:24.923
All right,
keep your tenants inside.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.027
Stop!

35:29.127 --> 35:31.163
No! Look at me, look at me.
Stay here.

35:31.263 --> 35:33.765
Do you understand now,
Jess?

35:33.865 --> 35:35.734
Yeah.
Do I have to kill her

35:35.834 --> 35:38.504
to make you understand?
Charlie,

35:38.604 --> 35:39.771
put the gun down, okay?

35:39.871 --> 35:41.707
Robin has nothing to do
with this.

35:41.807 --> 35:43.575
She won't understand!

35:43.675 --> 35:45.143
She doesn't even like me!

35:45.244 --> 35:46.912
Robin, that is not true.
I love you.

35:47.012 --> 35:48.079
Charlie, please.

35:48.180 --> 35:49.215
But you don't like me.

35:49.315 --> 35:50.616
That's true, isn't it?

35:50.716 --> 35:52.551
No! You just put yourself

35:52.651 --> 35:54.453
in situations
that make me worry.

35:54.553 --> 35:56.288
Situations like what?

35:58.257 --> 36:00.226
Hello?

36:13.705 --> 36:15.140
I got visual.

36:15.241 --> 36:17.643
Kasie, Knight and the sister

36:17.743 --> 36:19.811
and our guy with a gun.
Casualties?

36:19.911 --> 36:21.547
None that I can see,
but if you get him to the door,

36:21.647 --> 36:22.748
I might be able to slip in.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.250
All right. Copy that. Stand by.

36:24.350 --> 36:26.051
Jimmy, stand back.

36:29.555 --> 36:30.522
NCIS!

36:30.622 --> 36:32.057
Don't come in, he's got a gun.

36:32.157 --> 36:33.091
But we're okay.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.159
Stay the hell out!

36:34.260 --> 36:35.827
No good. He's not moving.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.330
I'm sorry, can we get back to

36:38.430 --> 36:41.099
how I always put myself
in these situations?

36:41.199 --> 36:42.368
This is an anomaly.

36:42.468 --> 36:44.202
It's a one-off.
I can think of others.

36:44.303 --> 36:45.437
You always think
I'm this big screwup,

36:45.537 --> 36:47.406
and I'm trying my hardest,

36:47.506 --> 36:48.740
and you don't even listen to me!

36:51.477 --> 36:53.211
Shut the hell up!

36:54.913 --> 36:57.483
My God! You two...

36:57.583 --> 37:00.519
Joe and I never argued
like this.

37:00.619 --> 37:03.154
Never.

37:04.089 --> 37:05.924
Which is why you're so angry.

37:09.695 --> 37:11.830
I'm angry

37:11.930 --> 37:13.365
because I should've been
on that bridge.

37:13.465 --> 37:14.700
But you weren't!

37:18.504 --> 37:21.206
What about the time you spent
off of the bridge?

37:22.474 --> 37:24.209
What are you talking about?

37:25.010 --> 37:27.045
It sounds like you two
were almost never apart,

37:27.145 --> 37:31.383
but you still couldn't save Joe
any more than she could.

37:34.953 --> 37:36.922
You're not mad at her.

37:37.022 --> 37:39.325
You're mad at yourself.

37:44.530 --> 37:46.998
I could have saved him.

37:47.098 --> 37:51.236
If you could have,
you would have.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.610
Charlie, no, no, no.
No, no.

37:58.710 --> 38:00.211
Yo, he's putting the gun
on himself.

38:00.312 --> 38:02.213
McGEE (over comm):
Copy that. Stand by.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.717
Charlie, listen to me.

38:05.817 --> 38:06.818
That time you spent

38:06.918 --> 38:08.219
off the bridge with Joe,

38:08.320 --> 38:09.388
it wasn't for nothing.

38:09.488 --> 38:13.058
It was if I couldn't save him.

38:13.158 --> 38:15.727
Joe said that he was happiest
when he was with you.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.463
That he fought his demons

38:17.563 --> 38:20.732
just so he could spend
a little more time with you.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.168
He did fight for the good.

38:23.268 --> 38:25.236
Fight like Joe.

38:31.009 --> 38:32.811
There is no more good.

38:32.911 --> 38:35.213
Then fight like us.

38:37.048 --> 38:39.050
Robin taught me that
you don't just fight

38:39.150 --> 38:41.152
with the ones that you love.

38:42.688 --> 38:44.356
You fight for them.

38:49.127 --> 38:51.963
Joe would want you
to fight to live.

39:02.974 --> 39:04.876
He's down! He's down.

39:04.976 --> 39:06.077
He's down, we got him.

39:06.177 --> 39:06.878
We got him.

39:10.148 --> 39:11.383
McGEE:
We got him, we got him.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.351
He's down.

39:21.126 --> 39:24.396
I'm sorry, too.
I'm sorry, too.

39:35.841 --> 39:37.476
Look at us.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.745
How old is this picture?

39:40.946 --> 39:43.081
That was the last Thanksgiving

39:43.181 --> 39:46.051
before Mom and Dad
got a divorce.

39:48.053 --> 39:50.856
Same year you gave me
this watch.

39:50.956 --> 39:52.057
I cannot believe

39:52.157 --> 39:53.391
that watch held up.

39:54.593 --> 39:56.862
I didn't even think
you liked it.

40:00.231 --> 40:03.969
Anyway, I better
get out of your hair.

40:09.975 --> 40:11.309
You know what I don't like?

40:12.678 --> 40:15.947
I don't like that you have
a brand-new career

40:16.047 --> 40:17.382
every eight months,

40:17.483 --> 40:22.053
or that you have more fiancés
than The Bachelorette.

40:25.891 --> 40:28.226
But what I love...

40:30.996 --> 40:32.864
...is how generous you are,

40:32.964 --> 40:36.502
and how you make everybody
feel like family.

40:36.602 --> 40:38.203
And that you make me laugh

40:38.303 --> 40:39.871
even when I don't want to.

40:41.239 --> 40:43.909
And that you call me
on my birthday.

40:47.513 --> 40:49.447
So, even if I don't...

40:49.548 --> 40:53.151
always like you, Robin,
I always love you.

40:56.121 --> 40:58.189
Okay, we've got him locked up
in holding safely,

40:58.289 --> 41:01.259
until Psych Services
can get here in morning.

41:02.694 --> 41:04.796
Hey, you know what, Robin,
this type of thing...

41:04.896 --> 41:06.331
happens more than you think.

41:06.431 --> 41:09.134
You work with
really nice people.

41:09.234 --> 41:11.236
Don't I, though?

41:11.336 --> 41:12.403
Nice people
who are late for dinner,

41:12.504 --> 41:14.405
or, uh,
maybe just leftovers by now?

41:14.506 --> 41:15.907
No, Vance and Delilah
are waiting for us

41:16.007 --> 41:17.175
to carve the turkey.

41:17.275 --> 41:19.177
So let's get over there.
All right.

41:19.277 --> 41:20.912
Ladies.

41:21.747 --> 41:23.615
Hey, good news, I just got
off the phone with Nick.

41:23.715 --> 41:27.018
According to him, uh,
my in-laws would now like

41:27.118 --> 41:29.020
everyone to come to dinner.

41:29.120 --> 41:31.389
Even more nice people.

41:31.489 --> 41:32.958
No... no.

41:33.058 --> 41:34.926
Mac-and-Cheezus and I
are gonna curl up on the sofa

41:35.026 --> 41:36.728
with some ibuprofen.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.363
How about it, Jess?

41:38.463 --> 41:40.398
It might be the perfect time
to finally meet them.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.167
Rain check?

41:42.267 --> 41:44.335
I think I'd like to have
a really nice,

41:44.435 --> 41:47.372
quiet, peaceful dinner for two
at my place.

41:48.674 --> 41:50.241
With my sister.

41:55.614 --> 41:57.683
I still have some
turkey subs left.

41:57.783 --> 42:00.418
Oh, no, I was thinking tacos,
like, lots of tacos.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.621
Oh, I know a great place.
Oh, I know a place.

42:02.721 --> 42:04.122
No, you have to try
this place in Georgetown.

42:04.222 --> 42:05.724
It's amazing.
Georgetown?

42:05.824 --> 42:07.225
Yes.
You have to try my favorite
place in Old Town.

42:07.325 --> 42:09.527
So good.
Excuse me.

42:10.596 --> 42:12.497
Order both.

42:12.598 --> 42:15.734
Happy Thanksgiving. Yes.

42:15.834 --> 42:17.002
Happy Thanksgiving.
Night, bestie.

42:17.102 --> 42:20.238
Come on, other bestie.

42:27.045 --> 42:30.048
My taco place is better, though.
