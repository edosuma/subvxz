DAUGHTER'S OTHER FIANCE.

13:31.930 --> 13:33.980

IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS.

13:34.020 --> 13:36.020
[MAL] IS THERE A REASON YOU
DIDN'T MENTION EDWARD?

13:36.060 --> 13:37.940
[JOYCE] I'M SORRY. I SHOULD HAVE
MENTIONED HIM. IT'S JUST THAT

13:37.980 --> 13:41.030
EDWARD MYKOS IS
AN EMBARRASSING MISTAKE THAT
WE'D LIKE TO FORGET.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.530
I DON'T THINK HE'S DOING THIS.

13:42.570 --> 13:44.110
[JAKE] AND WHY IS THAT?

13:44.150 --> 13:45.570
[JOYCE] CANCELLED WEDDING CAKES
AND SUCH, THAT'S NOT HIS STYLE.

13:45.610 --> 13:47.280
HE'S MUCH MORE RUTHLESS
THAN THAT.

13:47.320 --> 13:50.120
[MATTHEW] PACKAGE ARRIVED
FOR TRISH. DO YOU KNOW
IF SHE GOT IT OR?

13:50.160 --> 13:53.040

14:22.480 --> 14:24.280
[MATTHEW] WHAT WERE YOU EVEN
DOING IN THERE?

14:24.320 --> 14:27.910
[TRICIA] I GOT THE VEIL AND
I JUST WANTED TO TRY IT ON AND

14:27.950 --> 14:30.410
THE FIRE JUST CAME
OUT OF NOWHERE.

14:30.450 --> 14:34.120
[MAL] THE FIRE DEPARTMENT SAYS
THE BLAZE IN THE TENT WAS
CAUSED BY AN ACCELERANT.

14:34.160 --> 14:36.080
[TRICIA] AND EDWARD MYKOS
WAS HERE?

14:36.120 --> 14:38.460
[JOYCE] NOW LET'S NOT GET
SPOOKED BY ALL OF THAT. YOU JUST

14:38.500 --> 14:41.130
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER AND FOCUS
ON TOMORROW.

14:41.170 --> 14:44.000
[JAKE] OKAY, CALL ME OLD
FASHIONED BUT A BRIDE CATCHING

14:44.050 --> 14:46.590
ON FIRE SEEMS LIKE A BIT OF A
BAD OMEN. NO?

14:46.630 --> 14:48.130
[JOYCE] WE'RE NOT CANCELLING.

14:48.180 --> 14:50.220
NOT AFTER ALL THIS HARD WORK
AND PREPARATION.

14:50.260 --> 14:53.680
[TRICIA] MOM, NO. I HAVE NO
INTENTION OF BACKING DOWN.

14:53.720 --> 14:58.270
I WAS NOT RAISED THAT WAY.
I'M GETTING MARRIED
TOMORROW, AS PLANNED.

14:58.310 --> 15:01.940
[JOYCE] THEN LET'S JUST
FIND OUT WHO DID IT AND
STOP THIS NONSENSE.

15:05.780 --> 15:09.280
[JAKE] CARLIE. WE NEED TO ASK
YOU A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.

15:09.320 --> 15:10.990
[CARLIE] UH, SURE.
[JAKE] YOU KNOW,

15:11.030 --> 15:13.870
DUE TO THE RECENT EVENTS,
I THINK THIS ONE'S KIND
OF PERTINENT.

15:15.200 --> 15:19.120
WHAT'S YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH
CHAD? AND WHY WERE YOU GOING
TO SEE HIM AT THIS WORK?

15:19.160 --> 15:20.120
[CARLIE] I TOLD HIM TO BACK OFF.

15:20.170 --> 15:23.000
HE'S A STALKER. HE'S A FREAK.

15:23.040 --> 15:27.550
TRICIA DOESN'T NEED
THAT RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW.
THE GIRLS ARE HERE I GOTTA GO.

15:27.590 --> 15:31.090
[JAKE] LOOKS LIKE
THE STAGETTE IS STARTING.
MAYBE THEY NEED A STRIPPER?

15:31.140 --> 15:32.760
[MAL] THINGS ARE GETTING A
LITTLE HEATED AROUND HERE.

15:32.800 --> 15:35.510
SOMEONE SHOULD STICK AROUND AND
KEEP AN EYE ON THESE GIRLS.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.930
[JAKE] YEAH, I KNOW A GUY
WHO LIKES TO WATCH.

A LOT OF ENERGY.

17:38.300 --> 17:41.100
TRICIA WILL JUST BAIL OUT BEFORE
THE WEDDING. SHE ALWAYS DOES.

17:41.140 --> 17:44.140
[JAKE] WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE
JUST MAKING SURE. FOR GOOD
MEASURE, I MEAN.

17:44.180 --> 17:50.610
[EDWARD] I GOT BETTER THINGS TO
DO WITH MY TIME THAN RUIN THAT'S
BRAT'S NEW WEDDING PLANS.

17:50.650 --> 17:53.650
[JAKE] WELL, UH.
YOU ENJOY YOUR DRIVE, TODAY.

17:54.900 --> 17:58.700
&lt;♪&gt;

17:58.740 --> 18:01.740
[EDWARD] IT'S ME. I DID WHAT YOU
SUGGESTED BUT IT DIDN'T WORK.

18:06.250 --> 18:09.040
[RECORDED VOICE/EDWARD] LOOK,
THE OFFER WAS THROW RIGHT BACK
IN MY FACE.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.880
[RECORDED VOICE/CARLIE]
WELL, TRY AGAIN. DO YOU
KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN?

18:10.920 --> 18:13.630
THE DAY AFTER THE
WEDDING, THE ONSLAUGHT BEGINS.

18:13.670 --> 18:15.800
[JAKE] THAT'S THE ONLY
INTERESTING STUFF. THE REST IS

18:15.840 --> 18:18.800
HIM ORDERING A SQUASH COURT AND
BUTCHERING THE WORDS OF SOME

18:18.840 --> 18:27.520
CLASSIC ROCK TUNE. WHAT'S THAT,
DAD? WHY YES, IT IS INTERESTING

18:27.560 --> 18:31.900
THAT CARLIE, THE BRIDESMAID, IS
CALLING EDWARD MYKOS. ROSE?

18:31.940 --> 18:34.860
YOU'RE RIGHT, THE ONSLAUGHT
BEGINS? WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT

18:34.900 --> 18:38.570
MEAN? IT'S A VERY ODD TURN OF
PHRASE. SO THIS IS WHAT IT'S

18:38.610 --> 18:42.330
COME TO? HUH? TWO OF YOU GIVING
EACH OTHER THE SILENT TREATMENT.

18:42.370 --> 18:47.330
THAT'S VERY MATURE GUYS. SO
OBVIOUSLY, EDWARD MYKOS WANTS

18:47.370 --> 18:49.460
THE WEDDING STOPPED. BUT IT
DOESN'T MEAN HE'S BEHIND ALL OF

18:49.500 --> 18:52.210
THIS. AND NOW WE'VE GOT CARLIE,
THE HOT BRIDESMAID, CALLING ALL

18:52.250 --> 18:53.460
THE EXES.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.420
[MAL] WOMEN LIKE TO STIR UP
TROUBLE.

18:55.460 --> 18:57.220
[ROSE] OH, AS IF MEN ARE ANY
DIFFERENT.

18:57.260 --> 18:58.430
[JAKE] OH, OKAY.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.390
[ROSE] CHAD HAS A RESTRAINING
ORDER AGAINST HIM FROM A

19:00.430 --> 19:01.720
PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIP.

19:01.760 --> 19:02.800
[JAKE] BEFORE TRICIA?

19:02.850 --> 19:04.640
[MAL] WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME
LIKE THAT?

19:04.680 --> 19:06.390
[ROSE] LIKE WHAT?

19:06.430 --> 19:10.350
[JAKE] AHH... JOYCE IS
AWFULLY EAGER TO HAVE
THIS WEDDING HAPPEN TOMORROW.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.730
SO YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GOING TO
GO TALK TO HER TO FIND OUT WHY.

19:12.770 --> 19:14.780
[MAL] I'M COMING.
[ROSE] I'M COMIN' TOO.

19:15.730 --> 19:17.650
[JAKE] OH, THIS WILL BE FUN.

HE'LL BE LOOKING FOR ME.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.780
[DES] IT'S A STRETCH LIMO FULL
OF DRUNKEN BRIDESMAIDS.

19:58.820 --> 20:00.740
HOT... YES. LOW PROFILE... NO.

20:00.780 --> 20:04.070
[TINNY] WELL, WOULD YOU LOOK AT
IT AND THINK IT'S FULL OF 20
GRAND WORTH OF POT?

20:04.120 --> 20:07.290
[TINNY] COME ON, RUBBER BOOTS,
IT'S A TRADITION.

20:07.330 --> 20:08.790
[JOYCE] CAN YOU GET THEM
OUT OF HERE, PLEASE?

20:08.830 --> 20:10.410
[DES] WE'RE STILL KINDA
TALKING THIS THROUGH, HERE.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.420

[JAKE] GUYS, PLEASE!

20:31.480 --> 20:32.850
[ROSE] WELL, YOU TELL ME!

20:34.730 --> 20:36.770
[JAKE] WAS THAT JUST MY
ASSISTANT, DES, DRIVING THAT?

20:36.820 --> 20:39.030
[JOYCE] WELL, I HAD TO GET THAT
STAGETTE OUT OF HERE. LUCKILY,

20:39.070 --> 20:42.280
THE LIMO SHOWED UP. I THINK ONE
OF THE GIRLS ORGANIZED IT.

20:42.320 --> 20:44.160
NO DRIVER, KEYS IN THE IGNITION.

20:44.200 --> 20:46.580
IT'S ONE GOOD THING
TO HAVE HAPPENED.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.830

23:56.390 --> 24:00.520

24:11.070 --> 24:13.200
[MAL] I TOLD HER TO SIT TIGHT.

24:13.240 --> 24:15.530
WE SHOULD GET THE GIRL BACK

SHE SAID CARLIE WOULD TAKE HER.

24:15.580 --> 24:17.620
[JAKE] AND WHERE IS CARLIE,
ANYWAY? SHE WASN'T IN THE LIMO.

24:17.660 --> 24:19.700

24:51.030 --> 24:54.610
[MAL] NO. I'D DO IT RIGHT
NOW, BUT THE CLIENT MIGHT
BE A LITTLE TICKED.

24:54.660 --> 24:58.490
[ROSE] I THINK THAT ALL OF THIS
JUVENILE ANTICIPATION ON MY
PART HAS MADE ME A BIT NUTS.

24:58.540 --> 25:01.580
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT
WEDDING MAGAZINES
LIKE A 20 YEAR OLD BRIDE.

25:01.620 --> 25:04.670

25:04.710 --> 25:10.710
FOR JUST YOU AND ME. LOOK
HONEY, I WANT NOTHING MORE THAN
FOR YOU TO MARRY ME FOREVER.

25:12.880 --> 25:15.890
[ROSE] YEAH, SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

[JAKE] HOW YA DOIN'?

25:23.520 --> 25:26.560
[TINNY] GOOD. THAT'S THE

[JAKE] KNOCK IT OFF. COME CLEAN

25:31.070 --> 25:33.320

25:33.360 --> 25:35.360
SO WHY DON'T YOU THINK
ABOUT HOW YOU'RE EXPLAIN TO ME

25:35.410 --> 25:38.620
THE HUGE SMELL OF MARIJUANA THAT

JUST THINK ABOUT HOW YOU'RE
GOING TO EXPLAIN IT TO ME.

25:45.750 --> 25:48.750
AND THINK ABOUT
HOW I'M GOING TO KEEP YOU OUT OF
JAIL WITH ALL THIS.

25:51.170 --> 25:55.550
HONESTLY, TINNY,
I EXPECTED BETTER FROM YOU.

26:07.770 --> 26:10.900
[DES] TINNY, WE NEED-- WE NEED

26:13.570 --> 26:15.860
STEAL 20 THOUSAND IN
DRUGS AND RIP OFF HIS CAR.

26:15.900 --> 26:18.660
[TINNY] WE CAN'T MAKE IT RIGHT
DES. I OWE HIM A GRAND

[JAKE] OH, IT'S A DANDY LITTLE
APARTMENT.

26:42.220 --> 26:45.810

[ROSE] ALL RIGHT, THIS FILE YOU
NABBED FROM MATTHEW'S APARTMENT
CONTAINS THE EARLY WORK

28:28.870 --> 28:31.460
FOR A VIDEO GAME.
IT'S KINDA LIKE A BLUEPRINT
FOR A GAME ENGINE

28:31.500 --> 28:34.040
WHICH IS WHAT MAKES A VIDEOGAME
WORK ON THE INSIDE.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.090
[JAKE] SO, HOW MUCH IS ALL THIS
STUFF WORTH?

28:36.130 --> 28:37.090
[ROSE] ARE YOU READY FOR IT?

28:37.130 --> 28:38.420
40 MILLION DOLLARS.

28:38.460 --> 28:40.010
[MAL] WHAT? FOR LITTLE MEN
PLAYING JUMP AND RUN?

28:40.050 --> 28:42.090
[ROSE] YEAH.
[JAKE] SO,

28:42.130 --> 28:44.840

28:44.890 --> 28:50.020
[ROSE] AND CHECK THIS OUT. THE

28:50.060 --> 28:51.940
[JAKE] WHY DON'T YOU
HAVE WALTER LOOK INTO THAT.
[ROSE] YEAH.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.940
[MAL] WHAT DOES A VIDEOGAME
ENGINE HAVE TO DO WITH
CANCELLING A WEDDING?

28:54.980 --> 28:56.360
[ROSE] I DON'T KNOW.

28:57.770 --> 29:01.320
[JAKE] WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH MY NIECE? WHY WAS
SHE IN THAT LIMO WITH YOU?

29:01.360 --> 29:04.530
AND WHY DID THE WHOLE PLACE
SMELL LIKE POT AFTER IT BLEW UP?

29:04.570 --> 29:06.320

OR I SWEAR TO GOD

29:06.370 --> 29:08.790
I WILL HANG YOU UPSIDE DOWN FROM
JUNCTION'S DECK UNTIL YOU CRY.

29:08.830 --> 29:12.830
[DES] ON MAN, TINNY'S GONNA KILL

29:12.870 --> 29:16.840
MORE PAINFULLY. HEY, CAN I UH,

[DES] A TINY THOUSAND. YOU CAN
GIVE IT TO ME IN COINS, I'LL

29:21.210 --> 29:23.970
ROLL IT MYSELF.

29:24.010 --> 29:28.810
[JAKE] WHY DOES TINNY NEED A
THOUSAND BUCKS?

29:28.850 --> 29:30.640
[DES] HOCKEY MEMORABILIA?

29:30.680 --> 29:32.930
[JAKE] PRACTICE FULL CONFESSION
DES, BECAUSE I'M GOING TO GET

29:32.980 --> 29:35.060

IF I HAVE TO WATER BOARD YOU

29:35.100 --> 29:37.560

29:37.610 --> 29:42.320

[JAKE] YEAH.

29:48.490 --> 29:50.740
[TRICIA] I JUST GOT ANOTHER
LETTER FROM CHAD. IT'S HIM. HE'S

29:50.790 --> 29:52.120
SABOTAGING THE WEDDING.

29:52.160 --> 29:54.000
[JAKE] A LETTER FROM CHAD? WHAT
DID IT SAY?

29:54.040 --> 29:55.920
[TRICIA] IT SAYS HE'S GOING TO
KILL HIMSELF AT OUR "USUAL

29:55.960 --> 30:00.840
SPOT". HE'S PATHETIC, OKAY, SO
HE'D TOTALLY DO IT. I CAN'T LIVE

30:00.880 --> 30:02.250
WITH THAT.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.050
[JAKE] OKAY, TRICIA. DO NOT GO
SEE HIM. ALL RIGHT, HE--

30:04.090 --> 30:07.680

&lt;AIRPLANE ENGINE&gt;

30:23.440 --> 30:25.190
[JAKE] THIS LOOKS
LIKE TRICIA'S CAR.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.360
[MAL] TRICIA!

30:26.400 --> 30:34.540
[JAKE] TRICIA! HER PURSE,
HER ID.

30:34.580 --> 30:39.580
[MAL] IT'S FROM CHAD.
LOOKS LIKE SHE'S BEEN KIDNAPPED.

30:40.080 --> 30:42.960
[LESLIE] WE'RE GOING TO HOLD
ONTO THE LETTER. SEE WHAT
FORENSICS MAKES OF IT.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.130
[JAKE] OKAY GREAT. I TOOK A FEW
SNAPS OF IT WITH MY PHONE,

30:45.170 --> 30:47.050

30:47.090 --> 30:49.640
[LESLIE] LOOK,

30:49.680 --> 30:52.350
[JAKE] WHATEVER YOU FIND,
IF YOU COULD LET ME KNOW
I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

30:52.390 --> 30:54.140
[LESLIE] YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT
THIS ONE.

30:54.180 --> 30:56.480
[JAKE] CHAD MIGHT HAVE A BIT OF
A VIOLENT PAST AND TRICIA IS

30:56.520 --> 30:59.190
TERRIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO
CHOOSING HER MEN, SO...

30:59.230 --> 31:02.150
[LESLIE] AND THE WEDDING IS
TOMORROW? POOR THING.

31:02.190 --> 31:03.730
[JAKE] YEAH.

31:03.770 --> 31:07.150
[LESLIE] BY THE WAY, LIMO BOMB,
IT'S A SIMPLE INCENDIARY DEVICE.

31:07.200 --> 31:11.240
TWO SMALL PRESSURIZED GAS
CANISTERS STRAPPED TO
THE EXHAUST.

31:11.280 --> 31:14.080
FORENSICS SAID IT SHOULD HAVE
BEEN MORE BANG THAN BOMB.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.000
WOULDN'T HAVE DONE MUCH
MORE THAN TAKE THE TAILPIPE OFF

31:16.040 --> 31:19.960
IF THE LIMO HADN'T BUSTED A GAS
LINE GOING 150 ON THOSE ROADS.

31:20.000 --> 31:25.250
[JAKE] REALLY? WHAT?
CAN'T I KEEP THEM?

31:25.300 --> 31:26.920
[LESLIE] JUST ONE.

31:30.220 --> 31:31.840
[MAL] WHAT DID YA FIND?

31:31.890 --> 31:34.260
[JAKE] WELL, YOU KNOW THOSE
LANTERNS THAT JOYCE HAD?

31:34.310 --> 31:35.220
[MAL] THE GAS CANISTERS?

31:35.260 --> 31:37.850
[JAKE] YEAH, THAT'S WHAT BLEW UP
THE LIMO.

31:37.890 --> 31:40.230
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;
[JAKE] IT'S ROSE.

31:40.270 --> 31:42.020
[MAL] SAY HELLO TO HER FOR ME.

31:42.060 --> 31:43.190
[JAKE] I WILL. HELLO.

31:43.230 --> 31:44.980
[ROSE] GUESS WHO SHOWED UP
LOOKING FOR US?

31:45.020 --> 31:50.110
[CHAD] STILL LOVES ME. I KNOWS

31:50.150 --> 31:52.370
[ROSE] DRINK THIS. PLEASE.

31:52.410 --> 31:53.620
[CHAD] UGH...

31:53.660 --> 31:56.580
&lt;GROANING&gt;
[ROSE] I'LL GET IT. DON'T WORRY.

31:56.620 --> 31:58.120
[CHAD] I'M SORRY.

31:58.160 --> 32:01.920
[JAKE] OKAY WELL, YOU KEEP HIM
THERE. WE'LL BE RIGHT OVER.

32:01.960 --> 32:04.960
&lt;♪&gt;

32:08.550 --> 32:09.420
[JAKE] READ IT.

32:09.470 --> 32:11.930
[CHAD] MY THROAT'S DRY.

32:11.970 --> 32:16.140
DEAREST TRICIA, YOU'RE STILL
GETTIN' MARRIED TOMORROW.
I'VE TRIED TO STOP THE WEDDING,

32:16.180 --> 32:20.940
BUT NOW I'M GONNA KILL MYSELF
AT OUR USUAL SPOT.
I DIDN'T WRITE THAT.

32:20.980 --> 32:24.150
[JAKE] THEN WHO DID?
[CHAD] LOOK, I DON'T KNOW.

32:24.190 --> 32:27.980
I ADMIT THAT I HAD A HARD TIME
GETTIN' OVER HER, BUT THAT
PENMANSHIP IS TERRIBLE.

32:28.030 --> 32:30.190
[JAKE] ALL RIGHT, NEXT QUESTION.

32:30.240 --> 32:32.950
CARLIE, WHY DID SHE GO VISIT YOU
AT THE HARBOUR, TODAY?

32:32.990 --> 32:35.580
[CHAD] YOU WEREN'T AT MY STAG
WERE YA?

32:35.620 --> 32:39.200
[JAKE] NO, I WASN'T. HAVE SOME
COFFEE. THINK.

32:39.250 --> 32:43.210
[CHAD] CARLIE, CARLIE, CARLIE
WAS TRYING TO CONVINCE ME
TO TALK TO TRICIA

32:43.250 --> 32:48.590
BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE.
I TOLD HER TO PISS OFF...
SHE TOLD ME TO PISS OFF.

32:48.630 --> 32:56.180
REALLY, I'M DONE WITH WOMEN,
PERIOD. YOU DON'T HAVE A BEER,
DO YA?

32:56.220 --> 32:59.560
[JAKE] MAYBE I'LL CALL THE COPS
AND HAVE YOU ARRESTED.
THAT'LL SOBER YA UP.

32:59.600 --> 33:02.600
&lt;♪&gt;

33:13.610 --> 33:15.360
[DES] WEIRD,
I DIDN'T HEAR YA KNOCK.

33:15.410 --> 33:18.580
[DYLAN] YOU ALMOST TOOK
MY HEAD OFF WITH THAT BAT.
I WANT MY PRODUCT BACK.

33:18.620 --> 33:22.120
[DES] YOUR PRODUCT?
WELL, UH, I BELIEVE THE LADIES
FEEL IT'S THEIR PRODUCT.

33:22.160 --> 33:24.210
[DYLAN] WHERE'S TINNY? LET'S ASK
HER ABOUT OUR LITTLE DEAL.

33:24.250 --> 33:27.840
[DES] TINNY'S NO LONGER
INVOLVED. YOU DEAL WITH ME, NOW.

33:27.880 --> 33:33.340
[DYLAN] SERIOUSLY? HMM, WELL I
WANT MY CAR BACK AND I WANT THAT
STASH. THIS IS REALLY BORING ME.

33:33.380 --> 33:38.050
[DES] WELL,
FINALLY WE AGREE ON SOMETHING.
LET THE NEGOTIATIONS BEGIN.

33:38.100 --> 33:40.180
[DYLAN] IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH YOU?

33:40.220 --> 33:44.640
[DES] YOU KNOW, YOUR CAR... IT'S
GOT LOTS OF CHARACTER. A
RIGHT-HAND DRIVE, VERY UNUSUAL.

33:44.690 --> 33:49.610
IT'S GOT A NICE GRIP. YOU CAN
REALLY FEEL THE POWER AT YOUR

33:49.650 --> 33:55.110
FINGERTIPS. IF YOU WANT TO SEE
THE REST OF YOUR CAR AGAIN, IN

33:55.150 --> 33:58.030
ONE PIECE, IT'S GONNA COST YOU.

33:58.070 --> 33:59.780
[DYLAN] IT'S GONNA COST ME?

33:59.830 --> 34:01.120
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

34:01.160 --> 34:06.670
[DES] LET'S SAY... A THOUSAND
DOLLARS. UH, A FINDER'S FEE. OR,

34:06.710 --> 34:11.300
I CAN KEEP SENDING IT TO YOU ONE
PART AT A TIME.

34:11.340 --> 34:14.050
[DYLAN] GRAND THEFT AUTO.
I COULD JUST CALL THE COPS ON
YOU, MAN.

34:14.090 --> 34:16.010
[DES] IT'S TRUE, YA, YA, YOU
COULD. BUT CONSIDERING YOU HAVE

34:16.050 --> 34:18.220
NO INSURANCE AND
THE CAR'S NOT REGISTERED.

34:18.260 --> 34:21.720
ALSO, THE COPS MIGHT BE
WONDERIN' HOW YOU GOT IT.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.140
NOTHING ILLEGAL, I HOPE.

34:24.180 --> 34:26.100
[DYLAN] I DON'T HAVE A THOUSAND
DOLLARS.

34:26.140 --> 34:28.730
[DES] THEN WE VENTURE TO THE
BARTER SYSTEM. THE CAR AND MY

34:28.770 --> 34:31.190
SILENCE FOR TINNY'S DEBT.

34:31.230 --> 34:36.150
[DYLAN] FINE. I WAS DONE WITH
HER, ANYWAY.

34:36.200 --> 34:39.030
[DES] AND... YOU NEVER BOTHER
US AGAIN.

34:39.070 --> 34:40.870
[DYLAN] WHATEVER, DUDE.

34:40.910 --> 34:43.700
[DES] IT'S ON THE CORNER
OF BOND AND VICTORIA;
KEYS ARE UNDER THE MAT.

34:43.740 --> 34:46.660
OH, AND YOU'LL BE NEEDING
THESE TOO. UH, SORRY,

34:46.710 --> 34:49.710
I WASN'T SURE HOW FAR THIS WOULD
GO. THEY'LL SNAP RIGHT BACK ON.

34:50.790 --> 34:53.800
&lt;♪&gt;

35:00.720 --> 35:02.760
[JAKE] HEY MATTHEW.
[MATTHEW] YEAH?

35:02.810 --> 35:05.350
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

35:05.390 --> 35:07.140
[MAL] THAT'S WHAT
I'D LIKE TO KNOW.

35:09.020 --> 35:10.310
[JAKE] WHATCHA DOIN', BUDDY?

35:10.350 --> 35:13.730
[MATTHEW] ME? NOTHING, YOU KNOW,
JUST WORKIN' OUT.

35:13.770 --> 35:15.230
[MAL] TO SOPRANOS SAX MUSIC?

35:15.280 --> 35:17.280
[MATTHEW] YEAH, IT PUMPS ME UP.

35:19.740 --> 35:21.410
[JAKE] REALLY?
[MATTHEW] YEAH.

35:21.450 --> 35:24.080
[JAKE] YOUR BRIDE, PATRICIA,
SHE DISAPPEARED.

35:24.120 --> 35:25.700
[MATTHEW] TRICIA'S DISAPPEARED?
[JAKE] YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

35:25.750 --> 35:27.960
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT WOULD YA?

35:28.000 --> 35:30.120
[MATTHEW] YOU'RE YELLING.

35:30.170 --> 35:32.710
[JAKE] I WASN'T TALKIN' TO YOU.

35:32.750 --> 35:34.050
[MAL] HI.

35:34.090 --> 35:35.300
[CARLIE] HI.

35:38.380 --> 35:40.300
[JAKE] HEY, WHERE'S THE BRIDE?

35:40.340 --> 35:42.260
WHERE'S TRICIA?

35:43.510 --> 35:46.520
&lt;♪&gt;

35:49.350 --> 35:51.230
[JAKE] SO, IT'S AN AFFAIR?
[MATTHEW] NO, NO.

35:51.270 --> 35:54.820
THIS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW
IT HAPPENED NOW.

35:54.860 --> 35:56.780
[CARLIE] IT'S JUST SEX.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

35:56.820 --> 35:59.950
[JAKE] REALLY,
HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR BEST
FRIEND WOULD FEEL ABOUT THAT?

35:59.990 --> 36:01.860
TRICIA'S SUPPOSED TO
MARRY THIS GUY IN A FEW HOURS.

36:01.910 --> 36:03.990
[MAL] I HAVE TO SAY, YOU DON'T
SEEM TO WORRIED ABOUT HER.

36:04.030 --> 36:07.410
[MATTHEW] HEY, WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT? THAT'S INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY. IT'S MY VIDEO GAME.

36:07.450 --> 36:10.250
[ROSE] YEAH. WALTER SAYS THIS IS
A CRUDE CONTRACT BETWEEN

36:10.290 --> 36:12.880
EDWARD MYKOS' COMPANY AND THE
DESIGNER, MATTHEW, HERE.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.670
[MATTHEW] MYKOS TOTALLY
RIPPED ME OFF.

36:14.710 --> 36:17.550
[ROSE] OKAY, MATTHEW SIGNED
OVER HIS RIGHTS TO EDWARD

36:17.590 --> 36:19.590
FOR THE GAME ENGINE FOR
10 PERCENT OF THE PROFITS.

36:19.630 --> 36:21.260
[JAKE] SO, WOULD THAT CONTRACT
HOLD UP IN COURT?

36:21.300 --> 36:24.970
[MATTHEW] NO, HE JUST WROTE IT
UP AT MY PLACE WHEN I FIRST
SHOWED HIM THE ENGINE.

36:25.010 --> 36:26.430
THE GUY'S A CROOK. HE'S A LIAR!

36:26.470 --> 36:28.640
[ROSE] YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE
A SMALL FORTUNE TO FIGHT HIM
ON THIS.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.390
BUT MATTHEW WOULD WIN THE
RIGHTS BACK IN THE END.

36:30.430 --> 36:32.650
[JAKE] AND THE 40
MILLION DOLLARS.

36:32.690 --> 36:35.230
BUT YOU DON'T GOT THE CASH TO
FIGHT MYKOS IN COURT, DO YA?

36:35.270 --> 36:36.440
[MAL] BUT JOYCE AND TRICIA DO.

36:36.480 --> 36:39.490
[MATTHEW] LOOK,
IT WAS JOYCE'S IDEA.

36:41.990 --> 36:43.740
[JAKE] JOYCE'S?
[MATTHEW] YEAH,

36:43.780 --> 36:45.870
I SHOWED HER THE CONTRACT
AT TRICIA AND EDWARD'S
ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

36:45.910 --> 36:47.290
[MAL] BYE BYE EDWARD...
HELLO MATTHEW.

36:47.330 --> 36:49.830
[ROSE] WELL, NO WONDER EDWARD'S
TRYING TO STOP THE WEDDING.

36:49.870 --> 36:52.790
JOYCE CAN FIGHT THE LEGAL
BATTLES AND HER AND TRICIA
WILL GET HALF

36:52.830 --> 36:54.420
BECAUSE OF TRICIA'S
MARRIAGE TO MATTHEW.

36:54.460 --> 36:56.000
[MAL] BUT THEY'RE LOADED
ALL READY.

36:56.040 --> 36:59.050
DO YOU REALLY THINK TRICIA WOULD
MARRY FOR A FEW MEASLY MILLION?

36:59.090 --> 37:01.800
[MATTHEW] WOAH-WOAH. IF YOU
THINK TRICIA'S PLAYING ME FOR
THE MONEY, YOU'RE WRONG.

37:01.840 --> 37:06.640
SHE'S REALLY INTO ME. WHAT? YOU
THINK SHE'S JUST AFTER THE CASH?

37:06.680 --> 37:09.220
[JAKE] I DON'T KNOW CARLIE,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

37:09.270 --> 37:10.180
[CARLIE] HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

37:10.220 --> 37:12.600
[JAKE] YOU'RE HER BEST FRIEND,
AREN'T YA?

37:12.640 --> 37:16.610
ROSE, COULD YOU DO ME A
FAVOUR? CAN YOU LOOK INTO UH,
JOYCE'S MANSION

37:16.650 --> 37:18.190
AND SEE WHO'S NAME
IT'S REALLY UNDER?

37:18.230 --> 37:19.610
[CARLIE] GET OUT OF MY PURSE!

37:19.650 --> 37:21.030
[JAKE] OH DON'T WORRY,
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR LIPSTICK.

37:21.070 --> 37:24.030
I JUST NEEDS TO
BORROW YOUR PHONE.

37:24.070 --> 37:30.040
SORRY. SHH. HI, YA, UH, SORRY.

37:30.080 --> 37:32.000
IT'S NOT CARLIE, I KNOW.

37:32.040 --> 37:34.040
ACTUALLY, IT'S JAKE DOYLE. JUST
WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT

37:34.080 --> 37:39.460
THE WEDDING IS STILL ON.
WOULD YOU MIND MEETING ME THERE?
THANKS.

37:45.510 --> 37:47.720
&lt;♪&gt;

37:47.760 --> 37:49.850
[JAKE] I INVITED MYKOS.
HE SHOULD BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

37:49.890 --> 37:51.770
[MAL] WHY?

37:51.810 --> 37:54.060
[JAKE] I DON'T KNOW. COULD BE
FUN TO HAVE THE WHOLE GANG HERE,
WOULDN'T IT?

37:54.100 --> 37:55.480
[JOYCE] STOP, STOP.

37:57.310 --> 37:58.860
HAVE YOU FOUND HER?

37:58.900 --> 38:00.190
[JAKE] YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM HER, HUH?

38:00.230 --> 38:02.400
[JOYCE] THE POLICE CALLED TO SAY
THAT CHAD WAS IN CUSTODY.

38:02.440 --> 38:05.990
[JAKE] RIGHT. HEY, BUDDY!

38:06.030 --> 38:07.950
[JOYCE] WHAT THE HELL IS HE
DOING HERE?

38:07.990 --> 38:09.740
[JAKE] OH, MYKOS? I INVITED HIM.

38:09.780 --> 38:14.290
[EDWARD] NOT SO MUCH INVITED AS
THREATENED. YOU HAVE NO PROOF
I SABOTAGED THIS WEDDING.

38:14.330 --> 38:16.120
[JOYCE] OH, SO IT'S YOU IS IT?

38:16.170 --> 38:18.790
WELL, YOU JUST TRY AND STOP IT,
AND IF YOU'VE COME HERE TO MAKE

38:18.830 --> 38:20.670
ANOTHER OFFER, THE ANSWER IS NO.

38:20.710 --> 38:22.000
YOU WILL HAVE YOUR DAY IN COURT.

38:22.050 --> 38:23.880
[JAKE] AND YOU'LL HAVE YOUR
MONEY, RIGHT JOYCE?

38:23.920 --> 38:26.010
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN LIVING
ON APPEARANCES?

38:26.050 --> 38:27.510
[JOYCE] WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

38:27.550 --> 38:29.680
[MAL] YOU PROMISED MATTHEW HERE
YOU'D FUND HIS LEGAL BATTLE.

38:29.720 --> 38:33.890
[JAKE] BUT...
YOU WERE HOPING EDWARD WOULD
KEEP UPPING HIS OFFER.

38:33.930 --> 38:35.640
TRUTH IS, YOU'RE FLAT BROKE.

38:35.680 --> 38:38.350
[JOYCE] WHAT? YOU'RE INSANE.

38:38.400 --> 38:41.360
[JAKE] I LOOKED INTO YOUR LITTLE
PILE OF BRICKS. IT'S A RENTAL.

38:41.400 --> 38:44.530
AND WHY IS IT YOU NEVER WANT TO
INVITE US IN? EVEN WHEN I HAD
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM?

38:44.570 --> 38:45.490
'CAUSE THE CARPETS ARE GETTING
CLEANED, RIGHT?

38:45.530 --> 38:47.530
[JOYCE] WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
COME BACK HERE.

38:50.570 --> 38:54.790
DO I HAVE TO CALL THE POLICE?
YOU ARE NOW OFFICIALLY FIRED!

38:54.830 --> 38:57.830
[JAKE] IT'S OKAY, I NEVER
THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO BE
ABLE TO PAY ME ANYWAYS.

38:59.960 --> 39:01.340
WOW...

39:03.380 --> 39:07.720
NOW, I AM NO INTERIOR DESIGNER,
BUT I HAVE A FEELING THAT
WHEN YOU HAVE A HOUSE

39:07.760 --> 39:10.510
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A FEW
STICKS OF FURNITURE IN IT, HUH?

39:10.550 --> 39:13.470
[MATTHEW] YOU SAID YOU WERE
RICH. YOU SAID YOU WERE HAVING
THE HOUSE PAINTED.

39:13.510 --> 39:15.060
[EDWARD] HA-HA-HA, PRICELESS!

39:15.100 --> 39:16.980
FANTASTIC!

39:17.020 --> 39:22.400
[JOYCE] I DID IT FOR TRICIA.
SHE NEEDS TO LIVE THE WAY
SHE WAS BROUGHT UP.

39:22.440 --> 39:24.780
[EDWARD] YOU'RE A GOLD DIGGER,
JOYCE, PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

39:24.820 --> 39:27.190
YOU AUCTIONED OFF YOUR DAUGHTER
TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER.

39:27.240 --> 39:31.570
[JOYCE] WHERE IS TRICIA?
I WILL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF
IF ANY HARM COMES TO HER.

39:31.620 --> 39:33.910
THE PERSON WHO SABOTAGED THE
WEDDING MUST HAVE TAKEN HER.

39:33.950 --> 39:39.580
[JAKE] THAT IS KINDA TRUE. AND
UH, WELL, THEY'RE HERE. HELLO.

39:43.460 --> 39:48.670
[TRICIA] I'M SO SORRY MOM.
IT'S JUST... I COULDN'T GO
THROUGH WITH IT.

39:48.720 --> 39:51.180
[JAKE] SORRY FOR THE PHONE CALL
THERE, TRICIA. I FIGURED YOU'D,

39:51.220 --> 39:54.600
YOU KNOW, ONLY ANSWER IT
IF IT WAS YOUR BEST FRIEND
WHO WAS CALLING.

39:54.640 --> 39:59.060
[MAL] YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO
SET YOURSELF ON FIRE, OR
REALLY BLOW UP THE LIMO, DID YA?

39:59.100 --> 40:03.020
[TRICIA] NO. I GUESS I'M NOT
THAT GOOD AT SABOTAGE.

40:03.060 --> 40:06.400
[JAKE] BUT HEY, IT'S THE THOUGHT
THAT COUNTS.

40:06.440 --> 40:09.610
[TRICIA] I JUST COULDN'T LET YOU
DOWN. I... I JUST THOUGHT YOU'D

40:09.650 --> 40:12.490
CALL IT OFF, OR MAYBE MATTHEW
WOULD.

40:12.530 --> 40:14.070
[JOYCE] TRICIA.

40:14.120 --> 40:17.620
[TRICIA] I JUST NEED TO LIVE MY
OWN LIFE AND I'M REALLY SORRY I

40:17.660 --> 40:20.830
COULDN'T TELL YOU THAT.

40:20.870 --> 40:23.580
[JAKE] CARLIE YOU'RE SOME
FRIEND, HUH? FIRST YOU TRY TO

40:23.630 --> 40:27.090
GET CHAD TO SABOTAGE THE WEDDING
AND THEN YOU GET EDDIE HERE TO

40:27.130 --> 40:31.300
UP HIS OFFER. YOU EVEN WENT SO
FAR AS TO SLEEP WITH MATTHEW.

40:31.340 --> 40:33.760
[CARLIE] I'M A GOOD MAID OF
HONOUR, WHAT CAN I SAY? PLUS,

40:33.800 --> 40:37.390
MATTHEW'S PRETTY CUTE.

40:37.430 --> 40:43.020
[MATTHEW] WELL, YOU ARE
SUPER HOT. SHE IS...
PRETTY ATTRACTIVE.

40:43.060 --> 40:44.310

40:44.360 --> 40:47.610
