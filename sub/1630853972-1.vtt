WEBVTT

00:15.749 --> 00:18.152
Just give it up, Fabian.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.033
- Ow!

00:33.101 --> 00:34.435
- Aww, man.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.372
Dang it.
This was my year

00:38.472 --> 00:40.007
for the Agent Skills
Competition.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.009
I put it on my vision board
and everything.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.545
- Next to the sunset?
- Above the sunset.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.547
Wow. I can't believe
that didn't work.

00:46.614 --> 00:48.549
Well, maybe next time--
and I know this sounds crazy--

00:48.649 --> 00:50.118
you could try not sucking.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.286
Well, you don't have to be
a dick about it.

00:52.353 --> 00:53.487
Have to? No.

00:53.554 --> 00:54.988
But then I wouldn't
be able to tell you

00:55.055 --> 00:56.390
that the Treaty of Versailles
called,

00:56.490 --> 00:58.559
and it wants its total failure
to achieve any

00:58.659 --> 01:00.060
of its stated goals back.

01:00.128 --> 01:01.662
Also, it's sorry about Europe.

01:01.729 --> 01:04.965
Well, if you're so great,
why is your intel so bad?

01:05.032 --> 01:06.667
My name's not Fabian.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.669
Oh, I know that.
That's my boss's name.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.404
Yelling it gets me in the mood
to shoot people

01:10.504 --> 01:11.905
that I pretend are him.

01:11.972 --> 01:13.641
- Well, you got lucky.
- Sure.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.409
Though, in a mirror maze,
maybe consider

01:15.476 --> 01:17.911
not putting on a gallon
of cologne that smells like...

01:18.011 --> 01:20.414
Gasoline
and decaying hobo foot.

01:21.582 --> 01:22.816
Ow.

01:22.883 --> 01:26.520
- Now what was that for?
- You're still wearing it.

02:05.393 --> 02:07.361
Hello, Clandesti-con,

02:07.428 --> 02:09.963
where spying meets
sweaty buffet food.

02:10.030 --> 02:11.732
Who wants a brochure for IIA,

02:11.799 --> 02:14.402
the soulless company
that is making us do this?

02:14.468 --> 02:16.904
Come on, Lana.
Let's have some fun with it.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.706
We'll take these lemons
and make--

02:18.772 --> 02:21.074
Concentrated citric acid
to spray in our own eyes?

02:21.141 --> 02:22.476
I have some in my purse
if you need it.

02:22.576 --> 02:25.045
This isn't so bad.
When I temped at IIA,

02:25.112 --> 02:27.080
they were trying
to increase productivity,

02:27.147 --> 02:29.650
so they docked your pay if you
peed more than twice a day.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.952
Ugh. I hate this company.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.388
Nice job in the competition,
Archer.

02:34.455 --> 02:37.791
Though calling your opponent
"Fabian" raised eyebrows.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.327
These two specifically.

02:39.393 --> 02:41.329
Well, despite the fact
that you're praising me,

02:41.429 --> 02:42.763
which makes it nearly
impossible for me

02:42.830 --> 02:45.566
to not like you, I still
definitely wanna murder you.

02:45.633 --> 02:48.001
Today is a crucial day
for all of you.

02:48.101 --> 02:49.837
We are launching The Agency

02:49.937 --> 02:53.307
as a distinct boutique branch
of IIA.

02:53.341 --> 02:54.842
Wait, really?
We'll have autonomy?

02:54.908 --> 02:58.779
Yes. Exactly as much autonomy
as Kermit the Frog.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.315
Yo, you think Miss Piggy
is abusing him?

03:01.349 --> 03:03.116
I know she plays rough, but--

03:03.183 --> 03:04.785
I get the feeling
he enjoys it.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.020
Who wouldn't?
Roughed up by a pig in jewelry.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.923
No. I mean you'll be
a thin piece of fabric

03:09.990 --> 03:11.859
with my hand up your ass.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.594
Where's your sense of wonder?

03:13.661 --> 03:17.465
IIA represents 60%
of private spying,

03:17.531 --> 03:20.200
but some clients
are too mired in the past.

03:20.301 --> 03:23.537
They want a personal touch.
Authenticity.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.773
That's what you lot are for--
to fake that.

03:25.839 --> 03:28.876
So pretend we're independent
to make IIA more successful

03:28.976 --> 03:31.379
and allow you
to ruthlessly exploit us.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.614
Welcome to the concept
of a job.

03:33.681 --> 03:37.217
Now, I'm giving the keynote

03:37.285 --> 03:40.321
a speech entitled
"Leadership as a Network."

03:40.388 --> 03:42.189
You can't just say
"noun as a different noun"

03:42.222 --> 03:43.557
and pretend
that it means something.

03:43.657 --> 03:46.794
Sure I can. I call it
"language as a weapon."

03:46.860 --> 03:48.362
Now, Archer, you need to win

03:48.396 --> 03:49.997
the Agent Skills Competition

03:50.063 --> 03:52.566
if we're going to launch
The Agency properly.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.735
By the way,
the board hates the idea.

03:54.802 --> 03:56.537
They'd rather you were
completely broken up

03:56.570 --> 03:58.038
and redistributed.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.341
So, Archer,
our fate is in your hands.

04:00.408 --> 04:02.976
- Well, sayonara, guys.
- Oh, boy.

04:03.043 --> 04:05.012
You know what?
I'll be honest with you.

04:05.078 --> 04:08.416
That's a responsibility
I take very seriously.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.153
Round of Glengoolie Blues,
please.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.323
I'm looking for one of you

04:15.389 --> 04:17.325
to take the mantle
of leadership.

04:17.391 --> 04:20.193
Under me, of course.
So dot, dot, dot.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.095
Are the dots supposed
to make me love stickers?

04:22.162 --> 04:24.164
Damn it! I should be in
the competition with Archer!

04:24.231 --> 04:26.434
No, Lana. I need you here,

04:26.534 --> 04:27.601
front and center.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.102
And don't be afraid
to get out there

04:29.169 --> 04:31.104
and really be diverse.

04:31.204 --> 04:33.273
Remember, a personal touch.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.842
- You heard him, sweetheart.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.176
A personal touch.

04:36.243 --> 04:37.945
Hey, would you like
some stickers?

04:38.045 --> 04:40.080
- They're edible.
- They don't look edible.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.182
Anything's edible
if you try hard enough.

04:42.249 --> 04:44.385
- Aww, lucky.

04:44.452 --> 04:46.053
Should we do something?

04:46.119 --> 04:48.121
Like make popcorn? Or what?

04:48.221 --> 04:50.924
- Now where is she going?

04:53.361 --> 04:55.763
I think you got me.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.466
See? You just get me.
I do feel a responsibility

04:58.566 --> 05:00.033
to keep my mother's legacy
alive,

05:00.100 --> 05:02.770
but on the other hand, now I
don't have to worry about being

05:02.803 --> 05:05.138
yelled at by the one person
in the world who scares me.

05:05.238 --> 05:08.909
So do I go with responsibility,
or do I go balls to the wall?

05:08.976 --> 05:10.811
Or, more accurately,
balls to the wall

05:10.911 --> 05:13.146
then through that wall
into an adjoining wall

05:13.213 --> 05:14.548
that's probably load-bearing.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.820
So...which is it?

05:21.755 --> 05:23.056
I'm thinking.

05:24.291 --> 05:25.959
I thought that was you,
Lana.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.095
- Finally.
- Robert? What the hell?

05:28.161 --> 05:29.963
Did you just fly
all the way to Dubai

05:29.997 --> 05:32.265
to hear me say,
"Talk to my divorce lawyer"?

05:32.332 --> 05:34.668
Yes. And was on the way
to Abu Dhabi.

05:34.768 --> 05:37.505
Now, I get that I'm the one
who's mostly at fault here--

05:37.605 --> 05:39.840
- Mostly?
- But you aren't blameless.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.075
And we need to think about
what's best for AJ.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.344
Oh-ho-ho. Is that
why you nailed that skank?

05:44.412 --> 05:46.914
For AJ? What, were you looking
for a parenting book

05:46.980 --> 05:48.181
between her piss flaps?

05:48.248 --> 05:50.418
No. That's not where
they keep those.

05:50.484 --> 05:51.519
What are you even
worried about?

05:51.585 --> 05:52.653
We signed a prenup.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.522
Well, there is the issue
of custody.

05:54.622 --> 05:56.023
Excuse me?

05:56.123 --> 05:57.591
I'm just being realistic.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.860
It was your job
that got AJ kidnapped.

05:59.960 --> 06:03.096
To a judge, that sounds
like an unsafe environment.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.798
And if they put AJ
on the stand,

06:04.865 --> 06:08.035
are you 100% sure
she chooses you?

06:08.135 --> 06:09.870
Why do you have teeth marks
on your elbow?

06:09.970 --> 06:12.039
I'll show you.
Do you like stickers?

06:12.139 --> 06:14.207
I'm sensing you need space.

06:15.275 --> 06:16.444
- What?
- Shouldn't you be

06:16.510 --> 06:17.545
back at the booth?

06:17.645 --> 06:19.647
No, because what I do
is kick ass.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.348
And I should be
in the competition

06:21.381 --> 06:24.317
so I can take over
when Archer screws up.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.555
Come, now. Archer is reliable
when he needs to be.

06:27.655 --> 06:29.623
He's resting right now
for his next round.

06:29.690 --> 06:32.793
Uh, did he specify
the type of round?

06:32.860 --> 06:34.061
Whoo-hoo!

06:38.398 --> 06:41.234
I'm not totally convinced
that's a downside.

06:41.301 --> 06:45.405
It's like his liver absorbs
alcohol and excretes luck.

06:45.473 --> 06:48.141
Having said that, you can stay
in the competition.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.810
Thank you.
I was going to anyway,

06:49.877 --> 06:51.044
you absolute turd.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.913
But thank you.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.848
The competition
is basically a formality.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.317
I'm generally considered
the world's greatest spy.

06:57.384 --> 06:59.653
Yes. You absolutely were.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.723
You know, I used to be a spy
just like you.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.025
Oh, who'd you spy for,
the Etruscans?

07:05.092 --> 07:06.426
Hmm. Indeed.

07:06.494 --> 07:09.429
In this biz, one minute,
you're the greatest thing

07:09.497 --> 07:11.398
since the 3:00 p.m.
dinner special,

07:11.431 --> 07:13.934
and the next,
dog shit on a bun.

07:14.001 --> 07:17.104
My advice?
Buy mustard, lad.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.740
Why would I buy mustard
to eat myself?

07:19.773 --> 07:22.375
So you think about that.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.444
Ugh. Why are you
in such a great mood?

07:24.545 --> 07:26.880
Why don't you ask your face?

07:26.947 --> 07:29.617
My face says Robert's
gonna fight for custody of AJ.

07:29.717 --> 07:30.918
- Um, can he do that?

07:30.951 --> 07:32.219
Well, when you have
that much money,

07:32.285 --> 07:33.887
turns out you can pretty much
do anything.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.188
Why is AJ not picking up?

07:35.255 --> 07:37.124
A kid not picking up
a phone call?

07:37.224 --> 07:39.560
Weird.
Did you try her telegraph?

07:39.627 --> 07:42.262
Or lighting the signal fires
of Gondor?

07:42.295 --> 07:45.198
Why is everything
so complicated?

07:45.265 --> 07:47.701
Because you're divorcing one
of the world's richest men-

07:47.768 --> 07:50.538
slash-ex-boss who wants custody
of the daughter you had

07:50.604 --> 07:52.806
- with a different coworker.
- Well, sure, but--

07:52.906 --> 07:54.775
All while you work
for a corporate behemoth

07:54.808 --> 07:56.810
that seems to be trying
to take over the world.

07:56.877 --> 07:59.379
Yes. All of that. I guess.

07:59.446 --> 08:02.215
Well, I discovered the answer
to all those problems, Lana.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.084
It's simple, it's easy,

08:04.151 --> 08:07.154
and it's right at the bottom
of this glass.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.457
Well, it wasn't at the bottom
of that one,

08:10.490 --> 08:12.660
But I'm no quitter.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.928
Behold, an audio bug.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.230
Ooh.

08:17.297 --> 08:21.168
And that's all it does.
The wonders of IIA science.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.837
A microphone.
Truly groundbreaking--

08:23.937 --> 08:25.973
for 1876.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.241
Hey, what's that new one
you're working on called?

08:28.308 --> 08:30.678
- The wheel?

08:30.778 --> 08:31.945
Got 'em good, Ikari.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.847
I am working on something
called The Wheel!

08:33.947 --> 08:35.616
But it's a sex thing...

08:35.683 --> 08:39.319
that I can't build at work.
And you call that justice?

08:39.352 --> 08:40.754
Okay, look, I get it.

08:40.821 --> 08:43.691
IIA might not be
the "cool upstart rebel,"

08:43.791 --> 08:45.158
but this ain't
<i>The Breakfast Club,</i>

08:45.192 --> 08:47.527
and Judd Nelson doesn't end up
with Molly Ringwald.

08:47.628 --> 08:50.197
He ends up at the bottom of
a lake wearing concrete shoes

08:50.263 --> 08:51.999
with my frickin' initials
on them.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.201
That's the power of IIA
with The Agency

08:54.301 --> 08:55.869
as your personal concierge.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.605
I'm intrigued.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.640
And tell them Ray Gillette
sent you.

08:59.707 --> 09:02.009
Wh--stealing my customers?
Really?

09:02.042 --> 09:03.711
You think that'll get you
Mallory's chair?

09:03.811 --> 09:04.978
All's fair in love and--

09:05.045 --> 09:06.379
- Ow!
- Ahh!

09:06.479 --> 09:07.848
- Damn it!

09:07.881 --> 09:09.116
Where the hell'd
you come from?

09:09.182 --> 09:12.285
A good leader always keeps
tabs on his team.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.054
So spying on us?

09:14.154 --> 09:16.223
How is it that passing out
brochures

09:16.323 --> 09:17.791
is somehow beyond you?

09:17.858 --> 09:19.727
And why are you standing there
nodding?

09:19.827 --> 09:21.662
I said I wanted leadership.

09:21.729 --> 09:23.664
You look like a bobblehead
they give away

09:23.731 --> 09:26.366
to raise awareness
for diabetic librarians.

09:26.399 --> 09:29.069
Technically, I'm prediabetic.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.239
Oh, what are we gonna do
about that guy?

09:32.339 --> 09:33.674
Complain and then nothing?

09:33.741 --> 09:35.342
This is fun.
Ask me another one.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.011
Here's some fun.
I just put a bug on Fabian.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.412
If we get dirt on him,

09:39.479 --> 09:41.882
maybe then he'll approve
my design for the gun bomb.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.917
You see, it looks like a gun--

09:43.984 --> 09:45.753
Or improve
working conditions.

09:45.819 --> 09:48.521
Yeah. We were promised
curated snacks.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.591
At this point, your blood's
just melted Otter Pops, huh?

09:51.692 --> 09:53.260
Well, you guys have fun.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.396
I'm off to find the best part

09:56.429 --> 09:57.898
the party room.

09:57.931 --> 10:01.601
Oh, if Fabian comes back, tell
him he can gnaw on my chode.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.773
Yeah, I'm not gonna
tell him that.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.276
Come on. Let's hear
some bottles popping,

10:09.342 --> 10:12.045
maybe some fun squishy noises.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.381
Whoa. Now, that's contraband.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.186
Not following you.
I'm not following you.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.621
Just checking stuff out.

10:24.557 --> 10:25.793
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

10:25.893 --> 10:29.462
Who's ready to Pam-page?

10:31.598 --> 10:33.233
Oh. Wrong party.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.802
Hey, get her!

10:39.206 --> 10:42.710
I need to party at work
more often.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.412
We are gonna crush
this next event.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.646
Whoa. Lana.

10:46.714 --> 10:47.915
High-fiving
is one of those things

10:47.981 --> 10:49.549
you should never do when drunk,

10:49.616 --> 10:52.319
like bomb disposal
or helping deliver a baby.

10:52.419 --> 10:53.987
Haven't you done
both of those?

10:54.087 --> 10:55.322
That's how I know.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.090
All right. Now, nobody worry,

10:57.157 --> 10:58.992
'cause Archer and I
have been resting--

10:59.092 --> 11:00.227
- Ahh!
- Shit!

11:00.293 --> 11:02.329
Guys, there was a room.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.997
Guns--lots.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.598
Like, they're probably coming.

11:05.665 --> 11:06.967
Kind of sounds
like you're coming.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.069
Kaboom!
That's a new thing I do.

11:09.136 --> 11:11.104
No, you don't. And it doesn't
even sound like that.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.306
- How would you know?
- Solid burn.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.275
But Pam,
look at the security here.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.509
They don't allow guns
on the floor,

11:16.576 --> 11:17.845
so what would they even do?

11:17.945 --> 11:19.346
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, guys.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.614
Something's happening
with Fabian.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.683
No!
<i>You'll pay for this!</i>

11:23.784 --> 11:26.353
<i>- You'll never take me alive!</i>

11:27.821 --> 11:30.157
<i>Okay, so you took me alive.</i>

11:30.190 --> 11:33.193
So, uh...what?

11:37.831 --> 11:39.967
Okay, now that we've had
a moment to process--what?

11:40.033 --> 11:41.701
Why are they kidnapping him?

11:41.802 --> 11:44.637
They're probably trying
to humiliate IIA.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.106
It's right before his speech,

11:46.173 --> 11:47.707
so they'll have to admit
he's kidnapped,

11:47.808 --> 11:49.276
and if they can't protect
their own,

11:49.342 --> 11:50.811
then how are they gonna
protect you?

11:50.878 --> 11:53.613
Then they parade him,
and then they kill him.

11:53.680 --> 11:54.982
What?
We were all thinking it.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.884
Does this solve everything?

11:56.984 --> 11:59.452
Yeah, except he said that
the board would break us up

11:59.519 --> 12:01.054
and redistribute us.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.991
Wait, are we actually
gonna save Fabian?

12:04.057 --> 12:05.826
No.
We're gonna save Fabian.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.694
You two have to win
that competition.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.629
We still need a splash
for The Agency.

12:09.696 --> 12:10.730
Plus if you dropped out,

12:10.831 --> 12:12.165
the kidnappers
will know something's up.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.734
Ugh. I really wish
I hadn't had that many drinks.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.503
Me too, but the opposite.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.139
So what's your next event?

12:20.507 --> 12:21.909
<i>Nearing the drop zone.</i>

12:22.009 --> 12:24.577
If you are to die,
please take comfort in the fact

12:24.677 --> 12:27.014
that it will not upset me
at all.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.383
Ugh. Oh, I'm gonna puke.

12:30.417 --> 12:33.353
Wow. Is it Dartmouth freshman
orientation already?

12:33.420 --> 12:35.488
Seriously, if you were any more
of a lightweight,

12:35.555 --> 12:36.857
you'd be levitating.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.191
Should we be, like...

12:38.258 --> 12:39.827
More concerned about
this Fabian thing?

12:39.893 --> 12:41.995
Nah.
The rest of the gang is on it.

12:42.062 --> 12:44.664
- Well, we could--

12:44.731 --> 12:46.766
Ooh, or we could, um...

12:46.867 --> 12:50.537
I hate to ask,
but who got kidnapped again?

12:50.603 --> 12:52.205
Still no call back from AJ.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.274
Okay, I'll just text her and
tell her that I'll take her out

12:54.374 --> 12:55.675
this weekend
and do whatever she wants.

12:55.742 --> 12:57.277
Wrong.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.112
You just demanded more time
from her,

12:59.212 --> 13:00.513
and now she just resents you.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.249
Text her that you were
just thinking of her

13:02.282 --> 13:03.550
and how proud you are.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.552
Then write,
"No need to respond."

13:05.618 --> 13:06.954
How do you know this stuff?

13:07.054 --> 13:08.455
It helps
that I've never moved

13:08.555 --> 13:09.890
past emotional adolescence.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.724
This event is very simple.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.561
Five briefcases.
Five spots in the finals.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.729
No weapons. Any question?

13:20.968 --> 13:22.569
Whoo-hoo!

13:22.635 --> 13:25.205
Johnny Utah!

13:28.275 --> 13:29.742
Excuse me.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.044
- Excuse me.

13:31.111 --> 13:32.712
Pardon me. Pardon me.

13:32.779 --> 13:33.914
Oh, 'scuse me. Pardon me.

13:39.086 --> 13:41.054
Falkor, away!

13:47.394 --> 13:49.229
Oh, ahh!

13:49.296 --> 13:52.765
I guess we're interpreting
"no weapons" pretty liberally.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.504
Ahh! Disgusting!

13:57.604 --> 14:00.073
Uh, let's not tell anyone
about this.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.009
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

14:07.680 --> 14:08.848
Decent trade.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.584
Altitude warning.
<i>Pull now.</i>

14:17.490 --> 14:19.993
- Ahh!
- You big baby.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.661
Just use your backup chute.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.098
Unless we were way lower
than I thought.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.167
Really should have been keeping
tabs on that.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.501
Oh, well.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.770
- Well, what?
- Well, catch me up.

14:30.837 --> 14:32.805
You've been here
the whole time.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.107
Quiet down.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.143
We're trying to flirt our way
to finding out

14:36.209 --> 14:39.779
who booked that conference room
full of dudes and guns.

14:39.846 --> 14:42.983
And striking out. 0 for 2.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.784
I don't know, y'all.
I can't get a read.

14:44.851 --> 14:47.120
He's like
a sexual Rubik's Cube.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.622
Or as I call it,
a Rubik's Cube.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.724
Huh.
Maybe I should give him a try.

14:51.824 --> 14:54.561
I've developed a sexual
nervous system stimulator

14:54.627 --> 14:56.463
I call "The Wheel."

14:56.529 --> 14:58.531
Okay, I'll bite.
Why is it called The Wheel?

14:58.565 --> 15:01.568
Because once it gets rolling,
there's no stopping it.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.503
Any other ideas?

15:03.570 --> 15:05.672
Literally anything.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.840
Can I help any of you

15:07.907 --> 15:10.510
in some way that does not
involve, and I quote,

15:10.577 --> 15:12.312
"a hot beef enema"?

15:12.379 --> 15:14.147
- That wasn't me!
- I panicked!

15:14.214 --> 15:16.483
Just stand right there.
Hold on.

15:16.549 --> 15:17.750
- Keep standing.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.152
Really,
I don't have time for--

15:19.219 --> 15:21.688
- And you're overwhelmed.
- Oh. Oh. Ahh.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.056
Ahh, ahh, ahh. Ahh!

15:23.090 --> 15:25.258
Got it! Whoever booked
the conference room

15:25.358 --> 15:27.360
- is staying in the Sultan Suite.
- Ahh! Ahh! Oh!

15:27.427 --> 15:28.528
You ever lend that thing out?

15:28.595 --> 15:30.097
Sure.
Just clear your schedule,

15:30.197 --> 15:33.333
because it goes for, like,
a couple of days.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.601
Oh.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.669
So we enter,
clear the guards--

15:36.736 --> 15:38.838
With what?
We don't have guns.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.340
Guys, in the dealer's hall.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.209
There's a ton of non-lethals
in there.

15:42.275 --> 15:45.012
Tasers, air hammers,
something called a knife light.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.613
Well,
then let's get sampling.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.081
All right.
We're in the finals.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.450
It's getting intense.
They tried to kill us up there.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.285
- How are things here?
- Great.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.721
We've located Fabian
and the kidnappers,

15:54.787 --> 15:56.456
and we've got a plan
to get them back.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.791
You do?
I was assuming you'd fail.

15:58.858 --> 16:00.627
And why would you think that?

16:00.727 --> 16:03.030
Because you're you?

16:03.096 --> 16:05.232
- This was the plan!
- I didn't think it would work.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.534
Are we really saving this guy?
He sucks.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.936
I hate him, and he's gonna
make us do bad jobs

16:09.969 --> 16:11.871
- for terrible people.
- You think I want this?

16:11.938 --> 16:14.074
All I want is to do my job
and go home.

16:14.141 --> 16:16.776
But if we get fired, that's not
gonna help my custody problem.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.111
Custody problem?

16:18.145 --> 16:20.247
If you need me to give Robert
a personal tour

16:20.313 --> 16:22.815
of an industrial thresher,
say the word.

16:22.915 --> 16:24.217
- No.
- Got it.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.918
- No, you don't.
- Okay.

16:25.985 --> 16:30.323
But, I mean, saving Fabian is
the only way we stay together.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.059
- Right?
- We'll figure the rest out,

16:32.125 --> 16:33.593
but not if we're separated.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.395
Y'all--y'all are family.

16:35.462 --> 16:37.564
Oh, my God.
Is this what it's come to?

16:37.630 --> 16:39.332
Acting responsibly?

16:39.432 --> 16:41.934
Ugh. Fine.
Let's go save a jerk's life,

16:42.001 --> 16:43.936
thereby making the world
a worse place.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.838
Yay for the good guys.

16:45.938 --> 16:47.507
Should we even do
the competition?

16:47.607 --> 16:49.442
If you drop out now,
the kidnappers will know

16:49.509 --> 16:51.111
something's up and kill Fabian.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.412
So what's the final event?

16:52.479 --> 16:54.013
Gonne be hard
to top skydiving.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.515
And now,

16:55.615 --> 16:58.118
it's time to reveal
the final event

16:58.185 --> 17:01.188
of the Clandesti-con
Agent Skills Competition.

17:01.288 --> 17:04.291
Your final event will be

17:04.357 --> 17:08.628
King of the Train!

17:10.297 --> 17:11.931
Holy shit.

17:11.998 --> 17:16.035
Forget responsibility.
I'm gonna be king of the train.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.143
Stay on your toes.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.145
One of us has to win
to keep The Agency alive and--

17:25.212 --> 17:26.713
Uh, yeah. Whatever.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.782
I'm gonna be king of the train.
Toot toot!

17:29.849 --> 17:31.784
Ugh.
Everyone in position?

17:31.851 --> 17:34.154
Yeah. But this stuff
from the dealer's hall

17:34.221 --> 17:35.688
isn't the most intimidating.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.157
I don't even know
what this does.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.860
Yeah, we're gonna need
a few minutes.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.229
I'll signal you
<i>at the start.</i>

17:42.295 --> 17:44.231
Chances are,
they'll be distracted watching

17:44.331 --> 17:47.567
the closed-circuit feed
of my glorious victory.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.736
<i>- If you touch the ground</i>

17:49.836 --> 17:52.672
<i>or get hit by a paintball,</i>
<i>you're out.</i>

17:52.739 --> 17:54.474
<i>You start with no weapons,</i>

17:54.541 --> 17:57.244
but you may find some
at points on the train,

17:57.344 --> 18:00.680
as well as a few surprises.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.415
Now, the time has come

18:02.515 --> 18:06.886
<i>to find the most skilled agent</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

18:11.424 --> 18:14.594
<i>Three. Two. One.</i>

18:14.694 --> 18:17.164
- Begin!

18:18.498 --> 18:20.900
- Shocking.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.102
- Kaboom!

18:24.437 --> 18:25.905
- Ahh!

18:25.938 --> 18:28.708
Whoa!

18:38.218 --> 18:40.787
Ahh!

18:42.955 --> 18:44.624
- Ahh!

18:44.691 --> 18:47.227
Oh, knife light! Now I get it.

18:47.294 --> 18:50.062
Hold still,
Cirque du Suck Ass!

18:52.965 --> 18:56.269
We're leaving. Nobody move,
or Fabian gets it.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.137
Do what he says!

19:05.745 --> 19:06.813
Archer! Duck!

19:07.814 --> 19:09.649
Ooh.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.318
Ugh.

19:11.418 --> 19:12.985
God.
You couldn't just duck?

19:13.085 --> 19:14.921
You know I have trust issues,
Lana,

19:14.987 --> 19:17.424
which you are
partially responsible for.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.591
- How?
- I don't know,

19:18.658 --> 19:19.759
but it feels right!

19:25.332 --> 19:27.967
Oh, now she has a jetpack
and a machine gun?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.068
How is that fair?

19:35.074 --> 19:37.344
- Still want that jetpack?
- I know you want me to say no,

19:37.444 --> 19:39.412
but the answer is still yes!

19:43.450 --> 19:44.651
<i>We need backup!</i>

19:44.684 --> 19:46.152
<i>They're bringing Fabian</i>
<i>to the floor!</i>

19:46.185 --> 19:48.355
- Throw me the gun!
- It's empty!

19:48.421 --> 19:49.689
Just throw it to me!

19:51.658 --> 19:53.960
Man, this is such
a bad idea.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.430
- Whoa!

20:04.771 --> 20:05.872
Look out!

20:12.379 --> 20:15.548
Everyone,
this is what we think of IIA.

20:15.648 --> 20:16.816
Lana. Lana.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.885
Do something!
Lana, I know you're faking.

20:18.985 --> 20:21.321
No.
I'm very, very unconscious.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.323
Why am I always
the responsible one?

20:23.390 --> 20:25.858
And so I don't shoot Fabian
for me.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.060
- I shoot him for--
- Ahh!

20:28.160 --> 20:30.563
What an amazing
<i>performance.</i>

20:30.663 --> 20:33.400
<i>Congratulations</i>
<i>to the king of the train,</i>

20:33.500 --> 20:35.902
<i>Agent Lana Kane,</i>

20:35.968 --> 20:40.473
<i>representing The Agency,</i>
<i>a boutique subsidiary of IIA.</i>

20:40.540 --> 20:42.375
- God damn it.
- Thank you.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.377
Thank you. You're too kind.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.879
And great work by The Agency.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.981
- Now, that was obviously

20:49.048 --> 20:51.751
a fake kidnapping
and assassination,

20:51.818 --> 20:53.152
but they didn't know that.

20:53.219 --> 20:56.022
In fact, this was
the demonstration portion

20:56.088 --> 20:59.225
of my talk,
"Leadership as a Network."

20:59.258 --> 21:03.363
I turned this unruly bunch into
a finely-honed fighting force.

21:03.430 --> 21:06.766
Sterling Archer himself stepped
between me and a bullet

21:06.833 --> 21:09.669
despite the fact
that he hates my guts.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.771
That is the power
of leadership.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.173
Well, thank you all

21:14.240 --> 21:15.775
for helping me with my speech.

21:15.875 --> 21:19.245
So who gets to be
head of The Agency?

21:19.278 --> 21:21.848
I gave away the most brochures.
Kaboom.

21:21.914 --> 21:24.283
Jesus, Cyril. Not the time.

21:24.351 --> 21:26.386
But it's me, right?
See me lead that mission?

21:26.453 --> 21:28.455
Actually,
it's Agent Gillette.

21:28.555 --> 21:30.390
So, uh, what?

21:30.457 --> 21:33.059
Because he understood
the true mission.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.795
He's been gathering dirt
on all of you for years,

21:35.862 --> 21:39.131
which he has compiled
in this very convenient binder.

21:39.198 --> 21:42.201
Like "Pam once snuck a goat
into the office.

21:42.268 --> 21:45.037
- No one knows why."
- I was fostering it.

21:45.104 --> 21:46.739
And the next week,
she brought in

21:46.806 --> 21:48.741
goat meat tacos for everyone.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.378
That goat's personality
was very toxic.

21:51.444 --> 21:55.047
Well, I'm sure you have
a lot to talk about.

21:55.114 --> 21:58.084
You backstabbing
son of a bitch.

21:58.150 --> 22:02.288
In my defense, I did not know
he was gonna tell everybody.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.591
Aww. Heh.

22:04.657 --> 22:05.758
Look.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.827
You know, you're good at this,
Archer.

22:07.927 --> 22:11.230
It'll take time, but maybe you
should get more involved.

22:11.297 --> 22:12.765
You're right.
And, you know,

22:12.832 --> 22:14.166
I didn't wanna let you win,

22:14.233 --> 22:16.669
but up there on the train,
I suddenly had this idea--

22:16.769 --> 22:18.738
being declared the best agent
in the world.

22:18.805 --> 22:20.840
That's gotta help
your custody case for AJ.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.775
And that keeps her in my life.

22:22.842 --> 22:26.679
Aww. Buddy, that won't affect
the case at all.

22:26.779 --> 22:28.280
They don't consider
that kind of thing.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.749
God damn it. That's it!

22:29.816 --> 22:31.751
I've learned
a very valuable lesson today.

22:31.818 --> 22:34.320
Making the responsible choice
is for suckers.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.956
Until now, I've been
the careful, restrained,

22:37.023 --> 22:39.191
subtle, rule-respecting Archer.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.594
- What?
- But that is over!

22:41.661 --> 22:43.362
Welcome to the new Archer.

22:43.463 --> 22:45.932
I'm gonna go find two bottles
of whiskey, three women,

22:45.998 --> 22:48.535
a full-color illustrated
edition of the Kama Sutra,

22:48.635 --> 22:51.671
and six gallons
of orange sports drink.

22:51.704 --> 22:54.874
I will see you all
when I feel like it,

22:54.941 --> 22:57.309
in hell!

22:59.946 --> 23:01.714
God damn it.

23:20.700 --> 23:23.736
<i>Made in Georgia.</i>
