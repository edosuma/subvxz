08:06.286 --> 08:08.487
OR WOULD WE CUT THE TABLE
TO A CERTAIN SHAPE

08:18.966 --> 08:20.866

AN INTERNSHIP.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.767
WELL, KRISTIN'S GOT
A RESTAURANT TO OPEN.

08:22.769 --> 08:24.269
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TIME
FOR THAT.

08:24.271 --> 08:26.771
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT KRISTIN.
I'M TALKING ABOUT MANDY.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.874
SHE LOST THAT INTERNSHIP
'CAUSE OF HER G.P.A.

08:28.876 --> 08:31.543
WAS IT TOO HIGH FOR HER TO WORK
IN FASHION?

08:32.880 --> 08:34.880
HEY, I'VE GOT A BUDDY
IN FORT WAYNE

WHO MANUFACTURES
THESE HATS.

THAT'S NOT
CUTTING-EDGE FASHION.

08:38.218 --> 08:40.185
YOU'RE NOT GONNA SEE THAT
ON THE RUNWAY

UNLESS YOU'RE BRINGING IN PLANES
DURING A SNOWSTORM IN DULUTH.

MANDY COULD DO WORSE THAN
STUDYING THE CLASSICS, YOU KNOW?

ON GOING TO NEW YORK CITY.

HAVE TO DO THIS.

AND GRADES ARE NOT A FACTOR.

I MEAN, I-I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID.

ON THE "J" TRAIN.

ABOUT THAT.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.531

11:06.533 --> 11:08.033
BECAUSE I READ PEOPLE.
I LISTEN.

TO NEW YORK WITH HER.

AT TELLING PEOPLE THEY'RE WRONG.

INTERNSHIPS
ARE EXPLOITATIVE,

ARE SO SHORT,

RIGHT.
...WALKING AROUND
OR TALKING

16:17.911 --> 16:19.477
OR GOING DOWN
TO BATTERY PARK...

16:19.479 --> 16:20.678
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

16:20.680 --> 16:21.980
...TO RECHARGE
OUR CELLPHONES.

16:21.982 --> 16:23.648
IT'S LIKE --

16:23.650 --> 16:25.350
IT'S LIKE --

16:25.352 --> 16:28.653
IT'S SO COOL
THAT THEY HAVE THAT.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.288
SO HE'D BE
LIKE A DISTRACTION --

16:30.290 --> 16:31.356
A LOVELY DISTRACTION,

16:31.358 --> 16:33.024
KIND OF LIKE
A BlackBerry IS FOR ME

16:33.026 --> 16:34.926
WHEN YOUR MOM'S TALKING
ABOUT HER WORK.

16:34.928 --> 16:36.661
SURE.

16:36.663 --> 16:37.962
LISTEN, IF YOU DON'T WANT KYLE
TO GO WITH YOU, HONEY,

16:37.964 --> 16:39.530
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
TELL HIM THAT.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.966
I'M AFRAID IT'S GONNA
HURT HIS FEELINGS, THOUGH.

16:41.968 --> 16:44.669
IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
AN ADULT RELATIONSHIP,

16:44.671 --> 16:46.871
YOU HAVE TO LEARN
TO DO ADULT THINGS,

16:46.873 --> 16:49.474
WHICH MEANS SOMETIMES SAYING
THE HARD THINGS.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.009
BUT...

16:51.011 --> 16:52.543
WHAT IF HE BREAKS UP
WITH ME?

16:52.545 --> 16:54.612
LET'S NOT GET AHEAD
OF OURSELVES.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.180
IT COULD ALSO END BADLY.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.651
ALL I'M SAYING IS
IF YOU LOVE SOMEONE,

17:00.653 --> 17:02.153
YOU SHOULD SET THEM FREE,

17:02.155 --> 17:05.289
AND IF THEY RETURN TO YOU,
THEY'RE TRULY YOURS.

17:05.291 --> 17:07.825
OR MAYBE THEY'RE COMING BACK
FOR REVENGE

17:07.827 --> 17:10.395
BECAUSE IT TOOK YOU SO LONG
TO SET THEM FREE.

17:13.867 --> 17:16.701
EVE, DINNER!

17:18.071 --> 17:19.037
OH.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.204
HEY, KYLE.
HEY.

17:20.206 --> 17:21.706
HEY.
Eve: ALL RIGHT.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.808
LET'S GET IT ON A PLATE
SO I CAN SHOVEL IT IN.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.676
I GOT THINGS TO DO, PEOPLE.
WHAT ARE WE HAVING, ANYWAY?

17:25.678 --> 17:27.512
UH, BRISKET
WITH CHOCOLATE SAUCE.

17:27.514 --> 17:30.581
TAKE THAT,
MICHELLE OBAMA.

17:30.583 --> 17:34.485
UH, BLANCA, MAYBE WE SHOULD
GIVE THESE TWO SOME...

17:34.487 --> 17:36.154
I KNOW THE DRILL.

17:36.156 --> 17:39.857
AY, OF ALL THE DAYS
TO FORGET MY FITBIT.

17:39.859 --> 17:42.260
THESE STEPS MEAN NOTHING.

17:42.262 --> 17:46.064
UM, OKAY,
SO, ABOUT NEW YORK.

17:46.066 --> 17:50.334
I THINK I CAN STILL GET
THAT INTERNSHIP AT DKNY.

17:50.336 --> 17:51.602
THAT IS GREAT.

17:51.604 --> 17:52.904
YEAH.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.306
BUT I THINK
YOU SHOULD GO WITHOUT ME.

17:56.342 --> 17:57.575
NO, YOU DON'T.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.177
YEAH, I DO.

17:59.179 --> 18:01.946
I'M WORRIED ABOUT BEING AWAY
FROM MY GRANDMA FOR THAT LONG.

18:01.948 --> 18:04.715
SHE GETS INTO
A LOT OF PICKLES...

18:04.717 --> 18:07.718
SO THE NURSES HAD TO PADLOCK
THE FRIDGE.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.688
BUT AT LEAST
SHE STOPPED GETTING INTO JAMS.

18:10.690 --> 18:15.526
KYLE, I KNOW YOU'RE JUST
SAYING THAT TO BE A NICE GUY,

18:15.528 --> 18:17.595
BUT I OWE IT TO YOU
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, OKAY?

18:19.365 --> 18:21.799
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO COME WITH ME.

18:22.702 --> 18:23.968
ARE YOU BREAKING UP
WITH ME?

18:23.970 --> 18:26.471
NO. I JUST DON'T WANT TO
BE WITH YOU.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.740
[ SIGHS ] OH.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.709
I'M NOT HEARING
THE DIFFERENCE.

18:31.711 --> 18:35.546
UM, OKAY, I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT
FOR THE SUMMER.

18:35.548 --> 18:38.549
SO IF YOU CAME WITH ME
TO NEW YORK,

18:38.551 --> 18:40.651
I WOULD
KIND OF BE DISTRACTED

18:40.653 --> 18:43.754
WHEN I WOULD NEED TO BE FOCUSING
ON MY CAREER.

18:43.756 --> 18:46.657
LIKE HOW YOUR MOM WOULD HAVE
DISTRACTED YOUR DAD

18:46.659 --> 18:48.793
WHEN HE WAS TRAVELING
THE WORLD.

18:48.795 --> 18:49.994
I UNDERSTAND.

18:49.996 --> 18:52.230
SO...

18:52.232 --> 18:53.798
YOU OKAY WITH THIS?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.233
YEAH.

18:55.235 --> 18:58.436
I JUST WANT YOU TO GET
EVERYTHING YOU WANT IN LIFE.

18:58.438 --> 19:01.506
SOMETIMES I WORRY THAT YOU'RE
SO SMART AND AMBITIOUS

19:01.508 --> 19:04.108
THAT YOU'LL OUTGROW ME
AND LEAVE ME BEHIND.

19:04.110 --> 19:07.745
HEY,
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.281
WELL, JUST TO BE SURE,

19:10.283 --> 19:12.517
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS TIME APART
TO IMPROVE MYSELF.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.619
YEAH?
OKAY, YEAH.
WHILE YOU'RE GONE, I'LL --

19:14.621 --> 19:16.287
I'LL GO BACK TO SCHOOL
AND FINALLY FINISH MY DEGREE.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.856
OH, THAT WOULD BE
SO GREAT FOR YOU!

19:18.858 --> 19:21.459
YEAH,
IT'S A SIX-WEEK COMMITMENT.

19:21.461 --> 19:23.761
BUT BY THE TIME
YOU GET BACK,

19:23.763 --> 19:26.430
I WILL BE
A CERTIFIED TAXIDERMIST.

19:26.432 --> 19:29.433
[ GASPS ] BABE! AMAZING.
YOU LOVE ANIMALS.

19:29.435 --> 19:31.969
AND YOU'RE ALMOST AS GOOD
AT SEWING AS I AM.

19:31.971 --> 19:33.337
YEAH.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.306
AND ONCE I'M AN EXPERT
AT STUFFING THINGS,

19:35.308 --> 19:37.308
I KNOW I'LL ALWAYS HAVE YOU
BY MY SIDE.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.743
OH, HONEY.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.648
YEP. I WANT TO
LOOK AT THAT FACE FOREVER.

19:51.357 --> 19:54.058
HEY. MIKE BAXTER HERE
WITH A WORD ABOUT DATE NIGHT.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.960
I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA,

19:55.962 --> 19:59.797
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
MY WIFE INSISTS ON COMING ALONG.

19:59.799 --> 20:02.400
HOW MUCH CLOSENESS IS HEALTHY
IN A RELATIONSHIP?

20:02.402 --> 20:04.335
LET'S LOOK
AT SOME FAMOUS COUPLES.

20:04.337 --> 20:06.337
UH, FRANKLIN
AND ELEANOR ROOSEVELT,

20:06.339 --> 20:09.307
AMERICA'S FAVORITE
INBRED FIRST FAMILY.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.741
THEY WERE COUSINS,

20:10.743 --> 20:12.743
WHICH YOU'D THINK
WOULD MAKE THEM CLOSE,

20:12.745 --> 20:15.146
BUT THEY ACTUALLY SPENT
VERY LITTLE TIME TOGETHER.

20:15.148 --> 20:17.982
ELEANOR WAS TRAVELING THE WORLD
VISITING SOCIALIST COUNTRIES

20:17.984 --> 20:22.420
WHILE FRANKLIN WAS HERE
TURNING AMERICA INTO ONE.

20:22.422 --> 20:25.356
BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON
LEAD MOSTLY SEPARATE LIVES,

20:25.358 --> 20:27.692
BUT THEY'RE STILL
VERY MUCH IN LOVE...

20:27.694 --> 20:31.495
WITH POWER AND PANTSUITS.

20:31.497 --> 20:35.533
WE ALL KNOW JACK KENNEDY SPENT
A LOT OF TIME AWAY IN MARYLAND.

20:35.535 --> 20:38.069
THE STATE.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.904
YOU KNOW, WHERE CAMP DAVID IS.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.872
HE SLEPT WITH MARILYN
IN PALM SPRINGS.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.841
OH, YEAH.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.109
ON THE OTHER HAND,

20:45.111 --> 20:46.410
THERE'S COUPLES
WHO ARE TOO CLOSE,

20:46.412 --> 20:48.112
WHO NEVER GET A BREAK
FROM EACH OTHER.

20:48.114 --> 20:49.947
IT NEVER WORKS OUT.

20:49.949 --> 20:54.085
IKE AND TINA TURNER,
SONNY AND CHER,

20:54.087 --> 20:57.021
DONNY AND MARIE.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.023
NO, I THINK WHAT YOU WANT
IS A PROPER BALANCE.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.691
YOU WANT TO SEE ENOUGH
OF EACH OTHER

21:00.693 --> 21:02.860
THAT YOU COULD PICK YOUR SPOUSE
OUT OF A POLICE LINEUP

21:02.862 --> 21:07.765
BUT NOT SO MUCH THAT YOU END UP,
YOU KNOW, IN THE POLICE LINEUP.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.767
WHICH BRINGS ME BACK
TO DATE NIGHT.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.703
WHERE'S THE PERFECT PLACE
TO BRING YOUR HONEY ON A DATE?

21:12.705 --> 21:14.872
EVERYONE WOULD SAY,
"PARIS, EIFFEL TOWER,

21:14.874 --> 21:15.973
ARC DE TRIOMPHE,"

21:15.975 --> 21:17.275
BUT IT'S EXPENSIVE.

21:17.277 --> 21:18.442
IT'S CRAWLING
WITH FRENCH PEOPLE.

21:18.444 --> 21:19.744
UGH.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.812
SO BRING HER DOWN
TO THE OUTDOOR MAN GRILL

21:21.814 --> 21:22.913
OPENING NEXT MONTH.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.815
NOT ONLY
DO WE WELCOME LOVEBIRDS,

21:24.817 --> 21:27.318
WE SERVE THEM
IN A PORT WINE SAUCE.
