01:29.080 --> 01:30.274
Places, everyone.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.519
This was it.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.750
The moment it all began.

02:21.840 --> 02:25.469
The moment an ordinary little guy
fell in love with the theater.

02:26.360 --> 02:27.679
Everything about it.

02:27.760 --> 02:28.795
The lights,

02:28.880 --> 02:31.952
the way the scenery moved,
even the smell.

02:32.040 --> 02:34.235
He was only six years old,
but his plans to become

02:34.320 --> 02:37.517
the first koala bear in space
were suddenly toast.

02:38.720 --> 02:41.280
Some folks may have said he grew
up to be the greatest showman

02:41.360 --> 02:42.873
the city has ever seen.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.190
Some called him a visionary,
a maverick.

02:46.760 --> 02:49.274
Sure, some folks said he was
as crazy as he was stubborn,

02:49.360 --> 02:53.148
but I say wonder and magic
don't come easy, pal.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.754
And, oh, there would
never be any doubt.

02:55.840 --> 03:00.277
The name Buster Moon would go
down in entertainment history.

03:00.360 --> 03:01.839
And I should know.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.150
Because I am Buster...

03:04.280 --> 03:06.748
- Moon!
- Open this door!

03:07.240 --> 03:09.176
Good morning, Mr. Moon.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.794
Miss Crawly. What, uh...
What's going on?

03:11.960 --> 03:15.111
You got a lot of animals
waiting to see you, Mr. Moon.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.435
I do?

03:17.720 --> 03:19.790
Holy moly, I really do!

03:19.880 --> 03:22.519
Yeah, it's the
stage crew from your last show.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.632
They say
their paychecks bounced.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.296
Tell them I'll call up
the bank and make sure

03:26.320 --> 03:27.435
they're paid tout de suite.

03:27.640 --> 03:31.428
Oh, I got Judith from the bank
holding on line two right now, sir.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.616
Um, actually, I'm gonna
have to call her back.

03:33.640 --> 03:35.471
Oh. What should I
tell her this time?

03:35.600 --> 03:37.955
Tell her Buster Moon
is out to lunch.

03:38.680 --> 03:41.240
Moon!
Open this door!

03:43.160 --> 03:44.160
Come on, Moon!

03:44.480 --> 03:45.879
I know you're in there!

03:56.280 --> 03:57.280
Moon!

03:57.440 --> 03:58.839
Open this door!

04:55.960 --> 04:58.110
Mmm! Thought I heard
someone singing there.

04:58.560 --> 04:59.709
Ah, whatever.

05:02.680 --> 05:03.680
Guys, listen!

05:03.760 --> 05:05.512
Stay where you are.
The cops are here...

05:06.720 --> 05:08.438
What are you...
Hold it right there!

05:12.320 --> 05:13.320
Go, go, go!

05:19.120 --> 05:20.394
Whoa!

05:21.200 --> 05:23.760
Johnny, you were supposed
to be keeping a lookout!

05:24.040 --> 05:25.040
Sorry, Dad.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.315
And where's your mask?

05:48.840 --> 05:50.956
Look at me, I'm Mommy!

05:52.760 --> 05:54.273
Caspar, get off the table.

05:54.640 --> 05:57.108
Rosita, have you seen
my car keys?

06:01.280 --> 06:03.953
Norman, would you please tell
them what a good singer I am?

06:04.040 --> 06:05.951
Oh, yeah,
you were great, honey.

06:06.360 --> 06:08.510
And by the way, the bathroom
sink is blocked again.

06:09.400 --> 06:10.515
Bye, honey!

06:21.640 --> 06:23.995
One, two.
One, two, three, four!

06:42.640 --> 06:44.153
Oh, my gosh!

06:44.320 --> 06:46.675
I thought you guys
said you were musicians!

06:48.160 --> 06:50.993
Ash, babe.
I'm the lead singer, okay?

06:51.080 --> 06:52.296
Just stick to
the backing vocals.

06:52.320 --> 06:53.912
Sorry, I get carried away.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.558
Yeah, I know, right?

06:55.640 --> 06:57.756
It just kind of ruins
my song, you know?

07:24.040 --> 07:25.440
MEENA'S MOTHER
AND GRANDMOTHER: Aww!

07:25.600 --> 07:26.715
What?

07:26.840 --> 07:28.114
Come on, make your wish.

07:28.880 --> 07:32.509
Hmm! I wish you'd join a choir.
A local band, or something.

07:33.040 --> 07:34.519
I tried!
Bah!

07:34.640 --> 07:36.437
Hey, hey, Dad!
We've been over this.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.869
So she's a little shy.
So what?

07:38.960 --> 07:43.590
If I had a voice like Meena's,
I'd be a superstar by now!

07:43.680 --> 07:44.795
Just singing...

07:46.080 --> 07:49.390
Sure you would, Grandpa.
Now blow out your candles.

08:06.720 --> 08:07.835
A penny?

08:07.920 --> 08:08.989
How dare you!

08:09.160 --> 08:11.360
I happen to have studied at
the Lincoln School of Music!

08:11.600 --> 08:13.238
Sorry, it's all I got
right now.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.233
Oh, is that so?

08:17.440 --> 08:18.998
All right, prove it, pal!
What?

08:19.160 --> 08:20.320
Empty your pockets right now!

08:20.400 --> 08:21.400
Trying to find...

08:21.800 --> 08:23.576
What is this you got here?
I'm just trying to find...

08:23.600 --> 08:24.736
What do you smoke out of this?

08:24.760 --> 08:26.591
That's my inhaler.

08:27.400 --> 08:29.470
A-ha! I knew it!

08:30.080 --> 08:32.640
You all saw it! You all saw it right here!
The monkey lied!

08:33.760 --> 08:35.135
I forgot I had that.

08:35.159 --> 08:36.275
And next time,

08:36.360 --> 08:38.476
pick on someone your own size!

08:38.559 --> 08:39.913
You bully!

08:49.840 --> 08:51.432
Take care of her, will you?

08:51.520 --> 08:54.796
She may look old and rusty,
but she is a classic!

09:00.960 --> 09:02.837
Okay, listen.
We both know that my theater

09:02.920 --> 09:05.195
has been going through some
pretty rough times lately.

09:05.280 --> 09:09.353
But as the saying goes,
"For every cloud, a silver lining." We've got...

09:09.440 --> 09:10.920
Hold on
right there, Buster.

09:10.960 --> 09:13.793
My dad, he heard I was gonna see
you today and he was all like,

09:13.880 --> 09:16.758
"Eddie, you tell that koala I'm not
funding any more of those shows.

09:16.840 --> 09:18.176
"And that's final."
Those were his words.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.919
Your dad's right.
Those shows were the problem.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.956
War of Attrition.
Rosie Takes a Bow.

09:23.080 --> 09:24.920
I mean, nobody wants
to see that stuff anymore.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.228
So, what do I do?

09:26.640 --> 09:28.198
Quit?
No.

09:28.280 --> 09:31.238
I give them a show they cannot
resist, which is gonna be...

09:31.320 --> 09:32.320
Ahem!

09:32.360 --> 09:34.157
Just one more minute,
s'il vous plaÃ®t.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.151
Merci!

09:36.480 --> 09:38.436
Don't speak French.
They speak English here.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.596
Now, my next show
is gonna be...

09:40.680 --> 09:41.908
Drumroll, please.

09:43.560 --> 09:45.471
A singing competition!

09:46.240 --> 09:47.719
A singing competition?

09:48.040 --> 09:49.456
Who wants to see
another one of those?

09:49.480 --> 09:51.391
Everyone! Just...
Just think.

09:51.480 --> 09:55.439
Your neighbor, the grocery store
manager, that chicken! Right there!

09:55.520 --> 09:58.592
Everyone in this city
gets a shot at being a star

09:58.680 --> 10:00.159
live on my stage!

10:00.240 --> 10:02.356
Buster, this is
a terrible idea!

10:02.520 --> 10:03.748
Oh! No, it's not!

10:03.840 --> 10:05.990
Real talent from real life.

10:06.080 --> 10:09.197
That's what audiences want,
and I'm gonna give it to them!

10:09.320 --> 10:10.639
All right, well...

10:11.600 --> 10:13.936
Can we please just get
out of here? Don't you wanna eat?

10:13.960 --> 10:15.916
Yeah, but we can't
afford any of this.

10:16.040 --> 10:18.110
Yes, I know,
and that's why...

10:18.200 --> 10:19.349
I brought sandwiches.

10:19.440 --> 10:23.069
Uh, that's not allowed.
And... Ugh!

10:23.200 --> 10:24.696
What, you don't like
peanut butter and jelly?

10:24.720 --> 10:25.835
Excuse me, sir.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.576
Okay, look, I got cream cheese,
I got banana...

10:33.680 --> 10:34.680
You okay?

10:34.720 --> 10:36.119
Yup. Never better.

10:39.360 --> 10:40.680
Miss Crawly?

10:41.640 --> 10:43.198
Hello?

10:43.280 --> 10:45.236
Uh, who is it?

10:45.400 --> 10:46.674
It's me.

10:46.760 --> 10:48.352
Your boss. Mr. Moon.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.710
Oh, hello, Mr. Moon.
There we go.

10:50.800 --> 10:54.031
Now, I need you to add the following
information to our publicity flyers.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.120
Yes, sir.

10:55.200 --> 10:59.113
The winner of the singing contest
will receive a grand prize of...

11:00.080 --> 11:02.640
$935.

11:02.800 --> 11:05.598
Hmm. Gonna need more than that.
Just a second.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.472
Uh, there.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.155
$1,000.

11:13.360 --> 11:16.511
You got that?
$1,000.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.033
Oh!

11:24.840 --> 11:26.896
Print them up on every
single sheet of paper we have left,

11:26.920 --> 11:29.354
and let's spread the word
right away, okay?

11:29.440 --> 11:30.589
Oh, yes, sir.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.914
Okay. Come on out of there.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.317
Ah, the winds of change.

11:47.440 --> 11:51.194
Yep, when this show's a hit,
I'm gonna get you a fresh coat of paint.

11:52.480 --> 11:54.016
How are we doing with those
flyers, Miss Crawly?

11:54.040 --> 11:57.112
Oh, yes, sir.
We're all good to go here.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.200
Whoa...

11:58.320 --> 12:00.276
Miss Crawly, no! No, no, no!

12:01.600 --> 12:02.874
Oopsie-daisy.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.952
Well, I guess that's
one way to spread the word.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.319
Hey, Lance, look at this!

12:22.800 --> 12:23.994
Ash, babe. Hey!

12:38.120 --> 12:39.160
Meena!

12:45.720 --> 12:48.200
Hey, hey, hey!
What do you think you're...

12:50.160 --> 12:51.559
Uh-huh. Yeah.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.393
Ow. Mmm.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.120
Ah.

13:18.640 --> 13:19.834
Let's go to work!

13:23.160 --> 13:24.957
And cue the crazy old lizard.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.678
Good morning, Mr. Moon.

13:26.760 --> 13:29.479
Indeed it is, Miss Crawly.
Top of the morning to you.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.312
I made you some coffee.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.118
You did? Where is it?

13:33.240 --> 13:36.789
Oh. I got a little thirsty
on the way up those stairs.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.278
Shall I go open the doors now?
The doors?

13:40.400 --> 13:43.870
You've got a lot of animals waiting
in line to audition, Mr. Moon.

13:43.960 --> 13:44.995
I do?

13:47.600 --> 13:49.750
Holy moly, I really do.

13:53.160 --> 13:55.310
I swear to you, Eddie!
This is no joke!

13:55.400 --> 13:58.631
Look, just get down here and
see for yourself! I gotta go.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.279
This is it, Miss Crawly!

14:00.400 --> 14:04.518
Get your scaly tail downstairs
and throw those doors open wide!

14:14.320 --> 14:17.835
Okay, um, one at a time,
please. Calm down.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.280
Bye, Iggy. Bye, Perry.
Bye, Carla.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.719
Bye, Gail. Bye, Rory.
Bye, Micky.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.392
Bye, Moe. Bye, Nelson.
Bye, Hannah.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.436
Bye, Tess. Bye-bye, Caspar.

14:46.640 --> 14:47.640
Phew!

15:16.160 --> 15:18.833
Uh, let's hear from a few more
of the folks in line.

15:18.920 --> 15:19.920
What about you, sir?

15:20.000 --> 15:21.592
Well, Bob,
I'm a lab technician

15:21.680 --> 15:23.193
for a leading
pharmaceutical company,

15:23.280 --> 15:25.077
but I was born with a gift.

15:25.160 --> 15:26.991
And that gift is to sing!

16:06.960 --> 16:08.632
Oi, Dad!
Just going out.

16:08.720 --> 16:11.234
Well, don't be long.
I got the gang coming over.

16:17.280 --> 16:18.633
Look, I'm sure
you're gonna get

16:18.720 --> 16:20.016
a lot of namby-pamby
animals in here,

16:20.040 --> 16:21.040
saying things like,

16:21.200 --> 16:23.555
"Oh, it's not winning.
It's the taking part that counts."

16:23.640 --> 16:26.029
Yeah, yeah. Not me, pal.
I'm here to win.

16:26.120 --> 16:28.031
That prize, it's mine!

17:08.680 --> 17:10.715
Wow! Thank you, Johnny.

17:11.880 --> 17:15.031
Okay, next up we have Meena.

17:15.119 --> 17:16.189
Good luck out there.

17:16.280 --> 17:17.896
All right, come on. Here we go.
Come on, you can do it.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.114
You can do it. Okay.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.430
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.790
Okay. Hey, it's all right.
You know, it's all right.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.074
Take it away, Meena!

17:29.080 --> 17:31.640
Uh... Okay. Uh...

17:32.440 --> 17:33.793
Anytime, now.

17:33.920 --> 17:34.920
Um...

17:36.520 --> 17:37.760
Do you
wanna start over?

17:37.800 --> 17:39.552
Um...

17:39.640 --> 17:41.776
All right, enough of that!
That's quite enough of that.

17:41.800 --> 17:42.869
That's it. Come on.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.154
Off the stage, Helga.

17:44.440 --> 17:46.158
Go on, you're useless.
Thanks.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.118
Right. Here we go.
Hit it!

18:41.040 --> 18:44.476
Okay, that's everyone,
Mr. Moon. Phew!

18:44.600 --> 18:47.478
All right, call everyone back to stage,
Miss Crawly, and let's get...

18:47.560 --> 18:48.788
Ohh!

18:48.880 --> 18:51.872
Hello! Can I have everybody
back to stage, please?

18:51.960 --> 18:54.190
Everyone come back
to stage for selection.

18:54.320 --> 18:56.038
Okay. Thank you,
Miss Crawly.

18:56.120 --> 18:58.236
You're welcome, Mr. Moon.

19:07.240 --> 19:09.356
All right. Let's see, now.

19:10.800 --> 19:11.800
Hmm.

19:15.360 --> 19:20.388
I'll take...

19:20.480 --> 19:21.708
You guys.

19:22.400 --> 19:23.616
And which one of you
is the girl?

19:23.640 --> 19:25.153
Ha-ha. Very funny.

19:25.240 --> 19:28.232
"Loud and horrible,
but shows promise."

19:28.600 --> 19:29.999
Welcome to the show.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.593
Cool.
I guess we could hang.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.193
No, no.
I just want her, not you.

19:33.280 --> 19:34.280
What?
What?

19:34.480 --> 19:37.074
All right, the rest of the
group acts, thank you so much.

19:37.280 --> 19:39.635
Oh, don't feel bad, folks.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.712
There'll be a 10% discount
on tickets for everyone!

19:42.800 --> 19:43.869
Yeah, sure, thanks a lot.

19:44.480 --> 19:47.119
Let's get
out of here, Ash.

19:47.760 --> 19:48.875
Ash?

19:49.000 --> 19:50.672
Uh, yeah.

19:50.760 --> 19:52.079
Yeah, let's go.

19:52.760 --> 19:54.591
Okay, soloists!

19:55.280 --> 19:59.592
Johnny, Mike, Pete,
Richard, Daniel and Ray.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.355
Mike! Wowza!

20:03.440 --> 20:04.839
I've got to have you
in my show.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.433
Oh. If you insist.

20:06.520 --> 20:07.953
And I'll take Pete.

20:08.400 --> 20:09.594
Oh, yeah!

20:09.680 --> 20:11.079
And one more.

20:12.160 --> 20:13.479
Let me see now.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.551
Oh, my gosh.
I am so sorry.

20:15.880 --> 20:18.394
What is wrong with me?

20:18.680 --> 20:21.319
Whoo! Uh,
thanks for coming, Richard.

20:24.320 --> 20:25.958
Oh, my... Ray!

20:26.600 --> 20:27.715
Are you all right?

20:27.800 --> 20:29.836
Just hang in there, Ray.
I got you.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.036
Oh! Oh! Oops!

20:33.960 --> 20:36.394
Okay, then I'll take...

20:38.240 --> 20:39.240
Daniel.

20:39.320 --> 20:40.376
Thank you, Johnny.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.311
Daniel, can you hear me?

20:42.480 --> 20:43.879
You're in the show!

20:43.960 --> 20:45.234
What?

20:45.320 --> 20:46.799
Are you talking to me?

20:47.320 --> 20:48.753
Yes.

20:49.080 --> 20:52.152
I was saying
that you are in...

20:52.520 --> 20:54.556
Oh, geez, this is gonna
drive me nuts. Johnny!

20:54.680 --> 20:56.238
Get back here. You're in.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.959
Thank you, Daniel. Goodbye!

20:59.040 --> 21:00.040
Yes!

21:00.360 --> 21:02.430
Okay.
That's everyone on my list.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.434
Um, wait a second. Rosita.

21:06.520 --> 21:07.953
Is Rosita still here?

21:08.040 --> 21:09.598
Yes! Yes, I'm here!

21:09.760 --> 21:12.194
Rosita, Rosita, Rosita.
"Great set of pipes,

21:12.320 --> 21:13.833
"but boring to watch."

21:13.960 --> 21:16.110
I knew it.

21:16.240 --> 21:17.753
So, what should I do?

21:17.880 --> 21:21.395
I could partner you up
with Gunter.

21:21.480 --> 21:22.754
Gunter! Where are you?

21:23.360 --> 21:25.510
Ja! Ja! This is me.

21:27.680 --> 21:30.194
Ja!

21:30.280 --> 21:31.680
It's gonna spice things up
on stage.

21:31.720 --> 21:34.029
Wait. You want us
to sing together?

21:34.120 --> 21:36.475
Ja! The two of us together,
you joking me?

21:36.560 --> 21:38.994
We're going to be spicy, no?

21:40.080 --> 21:42.310
That koala's a fool,
Sherry-Anne!

21:42.400 --> 21:44.311
You are gonna be
a star one day!

21:44.400 --> 21:47.597
Auditions are over, pal.
Show's already been cast.

21:47.680 --> 21:51.229
Okay.
You are my chosen few.

21:51.320 --> 21:52.548
Yes!

21:52.640 --> 21:56.997
This is it, folks! A defining
moment in all of our lives!

21:57.240 --> 21:58.240
Um, no...

21:58.360 --> 22:00.936
No, no, no. Not you guys.
I dismissed all of the group acts already.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.029
You can go home.

22:04.480 --> 22:08.473
Look, I'm really sorry,
but all of the slots are filled.

22:10.680 --> 22:12.079
No, no, listen!

22:12.160 --> 22:13.957
No in show.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.314
Goodbye-bye!

22:15.400 --> 22:16.400
Miss Crawly!

22:16.520 --> 22:18.476
Come on, you guys!
Out of here.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.238
Come on. Off the stage.

22:20.320 --> 22:21.833
Thank you so much.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.148
Hey, Moon.
What's the story?

22:23.240 --> 22:24.720
Is the prize
really inside this thing?

22:24.800 --> 22:27.075
The prize? Oh, sure.
Yes, it's all in there.

22:27.480 --> 22:30.438
Open it, will ya? I wanna see
what $100,000 looks like.

22:30.560 --> 22:32.736
- Me, too!
- Yeah, go on. Open it, Mr. Moon.

22:32.760 --> 22:33.875
Sure, I'll open it.

22:34.360 --> 22:36.351
Wait.
What did you say?

22:36.440 --> 22:38.431
He said $100,000.

22:39.720 --> 22:41.039
A hundred...

22:41.680 --> 22:43.193
Uh...

22:44.480 --> 22:46.198
I forgot my keys.

22:46.280 --> 22:47.474
Koala be right back.

22:50.760 --> 22:54.719
For the last time, Miss Crawly,
I'm not going to fire you!

22:54.800 --> 22:56.176
Now would you
pull yourself together

22:56.200 --> 22:58.270
and please blow
that nose of yours.

22:59.480 --> 23:01.755
No, no, no. Not in here.
Blow it outside.

23:01.840 --> 23:02.875
I'm sorry.
Thank you.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.190
Buster, what do you expect?
She's, like, 200 years old.

23:05.320 --> 23:08.676
Eddie, please. Look, if your folks
could just loan me the money until...

23:08.760 --> 23:12.150
$100,000? Buster, come on!

23:12.240 --> 23:13.616
I got to think,
I've got to think,

23:13.640 --> 23:14.834
I've got to think.

23:14.960 --> 23:19.317
Look, maybe it's time to stop thinking,
and it's time to just move on.

23:19.400 --> 23:22.995
I mean, this theater of yours, you could
get some decent money for it and...

23:23.160 --> 23:25.096
I don't know, maybe we could
do something together.

23:25.120 --> 23:27.918
What? What, sit around
playing video games?

23:29.280 --> 23:31.111
Do you know what that is?

23:31.200 --> 23:32.235
Uh, it's a bucket?

23:32.320 --> 23:34.515
Yes, and do you know
why I have this bucket?

23:34.640 --> 23:35.696
Because the roof
is leaking?

23:35.720 --> 23:37.756
No, that's the bucket
for the leak.

23:37.840 --> 23:40.832
I have this one because
it belonged to my father.

23:41.480 --> 23:42.674
Every day for 30 years,

23:42.760 --> 23:44.990
he worked his tail off
washing cars

23:45.080 --> 23:46.957
just so I could
buy this place.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.672
Every day, Eddie.

23:50.160 --> 23:51.878
Just for me.

23:51.960 --> 23:54.838
Wow. Sounds like
a great dad.

23:57.320 --> 23:58.958
So how do you
wanna handle this?

24:00.520 --> 24:05.674
Uh, Mr. Moon, I got Judith
from the bank holding on line two again.

24:09.200 --> 24:10.680
Well, there's only
one thing I can do.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.673
Okay, everybody, listen up!

24:13.720 --> 24:16.439
I gotta send you all home.
Right now.

24:16.760 --> 24:17.760
Huh?
What?

24:17.840 --> 24:20.718
Yep. 'Cause like my dad
used to say,

24:20.800 --> 24:23.712
"Get a good night's sleep
and do a great day's work!"

24:26.640 --> 24:30.315
That's right. Rehearsals begin
first thing tomorrow morning.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.709
And if you wanna become stars
and win 100 grand,

24:32.800 --> 24:36.349
then you better be ready to work harder
than you've ever worked in your lives.

24:36.560 --> 24:39.916
So, get some sleep,
and dream big dreams!

24:41.240 --> 24:42.720
- Blimey!
- This is great!

24:44.600 --> 24:45.635
Miss Crawly!

24:47.720 --> 24:50.632
Come on, that's enough now.
Come on, off the stage. Please.

24:50.720 --> 24:51.835
"Dream big dreams"?

24:51.920 --> 24:52.920
I know, it's good, right?

24:53.000 --> 24:54.069
What about the 100 grand?

24:54.160 --> 24:57.038
Don't you worry, Eddie.
There's got to be a way to get it.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.951
What? Buster, no,
listen to me!

24:59.320 --> 25:00.469
This show is not gonna

25:00.600 --> 25:01.749
save your theater.

25:01.840 --> 25:03.478
You're at rock bottom, pal.

25:03.560 --> 25:06.597
Yep, and do you know what's great
about hitting rock bottom, Eddie?

25:06.720 --> 25:10.998
There's only one way
left to go. And that's up!

25:14.760 --> 25:18.150
And you can see the lucky few
leaving the theater behind me.

25:18.240 --> 25:20.216
Now back to you in the studio, John...

25:20.240 --> 25:22.993
Oh, honey, please don't cry.

25:23.080 --> 25:24.593
You are not a failure.

25:24.680 --> 25:26.352
There'll be other chances,
you just...

25:26.440 --> 25:28.192
Bah! The heck, there will!

25:28.280 --> 25:29.508
Dad, please...

25:29.600 --> 25:31.591
Come on!
Don't you want this?

25:31.680 --> 25:33.352
Well, sure,
but I messed it up.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.874
Then you gotta go back
there tomorrow and say,

25:35.960 --> 25:38.997
"Mr. Moon, I demand you
let me re-audition!"

25:39.080 --> 25:41.674
Be confident! Show 'em you
ain't gonna be pushed around!

25:41.760 --> 25:44.069
You got that, Meena?
Um...

25:44.160 --> 25:46.549
Good! Now go get my cocoa.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.958
I won't sell out for nobody

25:51.480 --> 25:53.948
Won't follow no fool

25:54.040 --> 25:56.713
Would you stop?
I'd only be doing it for us.

25:56.800 --> 25:57.800
Oh, really?

25:57.840 --> 26:00.195
Yes, really!
If I won that money,

26:00.280 --> 26:02.919
we could build our own recording
studio, start our own label.

26:03.040 --> 26:05.429
I mean, the whole world
would get to hear your songs.

26:05.520 --> 26:08.034
I'm not listening
to my girlfriend

26:08.160 --> 26:11.709
'Cause she just wants
to sell out

26:19.840 --> 26:20.909
Ah...

26:38.760 --> 26:39.875
Hey! Just a minute.

26:39.960 --> 26:40.960
Oh, wait. Wait!

26:43.680 --> 26:44.680
Aw, look at...

26:44.760 --> 26:46.830
I know Derek, the manager.
He'll vouch for me!

26:46.920 --> 26:47.955
Come on!

26:48.440 --> 26:49.509
Hey, Mario!

26:50.560 --> 26:51.879
How's it going?

26:52.440 --> 26:53.714
Oh, for crying out loud!

26:54.320 --> 26:55.594
Yeah, let the bears in.

26:55.840 --> 26:57.273
Let the bears in. Fine.

27:00.960 --> 27:02.518
There he is!

27:02.800 --> 27:05.314
I got a surprise
for you, my son.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.197
What's that?
Tell him the plan.

27:08.280 --> 27:09.280
Right.

27:09.680 --> 27:12.717
We've been told there's a ship
carrying $25 million in gold

27:12.800 --> 27:14.313
gonna dock at night
right here.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.631
With the usual guards
here and here.

27:17.720 --> 27:21.269
But lucky for us, there's
a sewer right under here.

27:21.360 --> 27:24.033
So, the getaway driver
meets us here.

27:24.200 --> 27:27.715
And that is gonna be you
this time, Johnny.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.235
What? You want,
you want me to drive?

27:30.360 --> 27:33.193
Yeah. It's time my boy had a
proper role in the gang, eh?

27:33.600 --> 27:34.874
Hang on, hang on, Dad.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.160
Barry's always
been our driver.

27:36.240 --> 27:38.390
Barry don't mind.
Do you, Barry?

27:39.760 --> 27:42.069
No. No, that's fine.
Yeah.

27:42.240 --> 27:44.959
So, when exactly
is this ship comin' in then?

27:45.040 --> 27:46.155
We ain't got a date yet.

27:46.240 --> 27:47.656
Probably won't be for
a while though, will it?

27:47.680 --> 27:48.829
What do you care?

27:48.920 --> 27:50.558
It's the last job
we ever need to do.

27:50.640 --> 27:53.108
When it comes in,
we go. Right?

27:53.480 --> 27:54.480
Great.

27:54.760 --> 27:55.954
Can't wait.

27:57.360 --> 27:59.157
Um, hi, I saw your ad
in the paper.

27:59.280 --> 28:01.999
Yes, I need a nanny,
just for a couple of weeks.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.832
You can? Great!

28:04.720 --> 28:08.235
The kids? Yes, they're wonderful.
Yeah, I have 25.

28:08.960 --> 28:10.916
No, I'm not joking.

28:11.040 --> 28:12.553
Um, but they're really
no problem...

28:12.920 --> 28:14.558
Hello? Hello?

28:14.640 --> 28:16.119
Good night, Mommy.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.157
Hey! How was the big meeting?

28:22.560 --> 28:24.073
That bad, really?

28:24.480 --> 28:27.199
Oh, I have something
really exciting to tell you...

28:27.280 --> 28:29.271
Mmm. You make
the best pie, honey.

28:29.440 --> 28:31.112
Listen, Norman,
I know it's short notice,

28:31.200 --> 28:33.360
but I could really use some
help with the kids tomorrow

28:33.480 --> 28:36.552
because, well, you are not going
to believe what I did today.

28:38.080 --> 28:40.548
Norman, are you
listening to me?

28:48.080 --> 28:50.833
Rehearsals begin first
thing tomorrow morning,

28:50.920 --> 28:54.435
so get some sleep,
and dream big dreams!

28:54.520 --> 28:56.192
Dreams, dreams!

28:56.280 --> 28:57.349
Hmm.

29:22.280 --> 29:23.736
Good morning, everybody.

29:23.760 --> 29:25.910
Now, I want you
all dressed before breakfast.

29:31.080 --> 29:32.433
Breakfast!

29:36.520 --> 29:38.875
Rosita, have you seen
my car keys?

29:39.040 --> 29:41.240
Don't forget,
your keys are in your coat pocket.

29:41.320 --> 29:43.470
Oh, I found 'em.
Bye, honey.

29:43.560 --> 29:44.709
Bye, Norman.

29:46.280 --> 29:47.508
Time for school!

29:49.520 --> 29:50.520
Bye, Iggy. Bye, Perry.

29:50.720 --> 29:53.314
Bye, Carla. Bye, Gail. Bye, Rory.
Bye, Micky. Bye, Moe.

29:53.400 --> 29:54.879
Bye, Nelson. Bye, Hannah.
Bye, Tess.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.439
Bye, Kelly. Bye, George.
Bye, Andy.

29:56.520 --> 29:58.238
Bye, Freddy. Bye-bye, Caspar.

30:05.160 --> 30:07.037
This contest is war!

30:07.600 --> 30:12.674
This stage is the battlefield.
Your song is your weapon.

30:12.920 --> 30:15.718
Now you only get one shot
to blow that audience away,

30:15.800 --> 30:19.315
so choose carefully from the list of
songs I've selected for each of you.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.994
Ah, talked some sense
into that boyfriend of yours?

30:22.080 --> 30:25.390
Lance is an artist, but I wouldn't
expect you to understand that.

30:25.480 --> 30:27.096
You're right. I don't
understand that at all.

30:27.120 --> 30:32.114
Now, you'll notice each list also includes
my costume and performance suggestions.

30:32.200 --> 30:33.758
Okay? Miss Crawly
will show you

30:33.840 --> 30:34.955
to your rehearsal spaces.

30:35.040 --> 30:36.314
Now, let's get to work!

30:36.400 --> 30:37.799
Excuse me, Mr. Moon?

30:37.880 --> 30:40.678
For some reason, it says here that
I should be playing the piano?

30:40.760 --> 30:43.718
Yes, just imagine, big,
soulful guy like you

30:43.800 --> 30:45.153
tenderly playing the keys.

30:45.280 --> 30:46.600
There'll be goosebumps
everywhere!

30:46.640 --> 30:48.456
Well, I haven't played piano
since I was a kid.

30:48.480 --> 30:49.708
Miss Crawly! We're gonna need

30:49.800 --> 30:50.896
some piano lessons over here.

30:50.920 --> 30:53.195
Yes, sir! Up the stairs,
I'll be right along.

30:53.280 --> 30:54.508
And, Pete, you're in here.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.158
You got it, Mr. Moon.

30:57.480 --> 30:58.515
Check your ego, man!

30:58.600 --> 31:00.360
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
break it up, break it up.

31:00.440 --> 31:02.351
Oh, yeah? Tell Ricki!
He started it!

31:02.440 --> 31:06.035
That's right! Just like I started
this band! My band, Howie!

31:06.120 --> 31:08.076
Oh, forgive me,
your highness!

31:08.160 --> 31:09.388
Guys, come on!
No, no!

31:09.800 --> 31:11.677
Hey! Get out!
Get out of here!

31:19.480 --> 31:22.790
Look, just calm down
and pick a song.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.120
I think we'll probably have
a better chance of winning

31:25.200 --> 31:28.078
if I do the singing part and
leave the dancing part to you.

31:28.160 --> 31:29.878
Bah! Are you joking me?

31:29.960 --> 31:32.679
You are just in need of,
like, a super cool warm-up.

31:33.040 --> 31:35.190
Come on! Let's take off
these clothes!

31:35.280 --> 31:37.240
That, that is not necessary.

31:38.240 --> 31:40.231
Oh! That is a lot of skin.

31:41.920 --> 31:45.196
Ah, don't you look so worried face!
I've got one for you, too!

31:46.040 --> 31:47.678
Hey, porky!
Keep it down, will ya!

31:47.840 --> 31:48.840
Sorry.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.037
Hey, Moon, you gave me
the wrong list.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.270
Cheesy pop's
not exactly my style.

31:53.360 --> 31:55.999
Style! I'm glad you brought that up.
Now, let's see...

31:56.320 --> 31:57.320
There.

31:57.400 --> 31:59.152
Isn't this a great
color for you?

31:59.240 --> 32:02.755
I can't tell. It's melting my eyes.
You got anything in black?

32:02.840 --> 32:05.559
Black? What, you want everyone to
think you're going to a funeral?

32:05.640 --> 32:08.154
You think you're some kind of
artsy-fartsy type? No, no, no.

32:08.280 --> 32:10.714
Bingo! Pop star princess!

32:12.080 --> 32:13.229
Wait, what happened?

32:13.480 --> 32:14.754
Is this part
of the competition?

32:14.960 --> 32:17.269
Okay, everybody, don't panic.
Don't panic.

32:17.360 --> 32:18.816
What's going on?
Talk to me, Crawly.

32:18.840 --> 32:22.230
When did we last pay
the power company, Mr. Moon?

32:22.440 --> 32:23.759
Oh, for Pete's sake.

32:24.360 --> 32:25.679
Okay, don't worry,
everybody.

32:25.880 --> 32:27.074
I will take care of this.

32:27.160 --> 32:29.754
In the meantime, you will
continue to rehearse in the dark.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.951
What?
But I can't see anything.

32:32.040 --> 32:34.508
Don't you worry, Rosita.
I have glow sticks.

32:35.200 --> 32:36.633
Great! Use this time

32:36.720 --> 32:39.439
to shake off those first day
inhibitions, and I'll be right back.

32:39.880 --> 32:40.936
You got to
be kidding me.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.030
Okay, you heard him.
Back to work now!

32:43.120 --> 32:44.758
Come on, everybody.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.475
Sorry, old girl.
I'll fix that.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.472
Hey.
Mr. Moon?

33:14.080 --> 33:17.834
You probably don't remember me,
but I auditioned yesterday and I...

33:17.920 --> 33:19.035
Hey, listen.

33:19.240 --> 33:21.629
Do you think, maybe,
you could reach the ledge?

33:22.240 --> 33:23.389
That ledge?

33:23.840 --> 33:25.432
Whoa-oh!

33:25.520 --> 33:27.160
That's a heck of a trunk
you've got there!

33:27.320 --> 33:28.594
Thanks a lot, kid!

33:28.680 --> 33:30.875
Uh, Mr. Moon?

33:31.560 --> 33:34.358
My name is Meena,
and I baked a cake for you

33:34.440 --> 33:37.989
and, uh, I was wondering if you'd,
maybe, give me a second chance to...

33:38.120 --> 33:39.189
Just a moment, please.

33:41.240 --> 33:42.559
Be right with you.

33:45.120 --> 33:46.155
Hmm.

33:55.240 --> 33:58.152
Yay! It's about time.

33:58.240 --> 34:00.356
Johnny...

34:00.480 --> 34:02.152
Yep, mind your head here.

34:02.240 --> 34:03.958
Hey, can you pull up
that scenic cable?

34:04.040 --> 34:05.792
You mean this?
Yes, that's it!

34:09.280 --> 34:11.635
Great.
And the house lights?

34:16.639 --> 34:17.675
Wow.

34:17.760 --> 34:20.149
Oh, I know.
Beautiful, isn't she?

34:21.480 --> 34:22.480
You know what, kid?

34:22.520 --> 34:24.280
How would you like to be
a part of this show?

34:24.400 --> 34:26.277
Really? Wait, oh, my gosh,

34:26.360 --> 34:27.713
I was just gonna
ask about that.

34:27.960 --> 34:30.155
Great! Because I could
really use a stagehand.

34:31.560 --> 34:33.437
Stagehand? But...

34:33.840 --> 34:36.149
Don't worry about it.
You're gonna pick it up in no time.

34:36.239 --> 34:37.992
I'll teach you everything
I know. Follow me.

34:39.320 --> 34:41.136
These are the rehearsal
spaces and dressing rooms

34:41.159 --> 34:43.469
and up here, we got workshops
and the main office.

34:43.600 --> 34:45.192
Up in the air!
Touch your toes!

34:58.200 --> 34:59.428
Awesome!

34:59.520 --> 35:00.589
Awesome?

35:00.720 --> 35:02.950
Yeah, I think the
word you're after is "awful."

35:03.040 --> 35:05.270
And that's me
restraining myself.

35:05.440 --> 35:08.000
There's not an ounce of talent
between them. Not an ounce.

35:08.080 --> 35:09.195
In fact, you know what?

35:09.280 --> 35:11.510
I think that prize
is as good as mine already.

35:16.360 --> 35:20.592
Yes, indeed. I am about to come into
a very, very large sum of money.

35:20.720 --> 35:22.870
$100,000 to be precise.

35:23.120 --> 35:24.599
Well, is that so?

35:24.680 --> 35:27.558
In that case, sir, you'll be
wanting our platinum card.

35:47.840 --> 35:49.751
Well, well, well...
Hello again.

35:57.560 --> 36:00.870
Oh, man, these are like the
cheesiest songs of all time.

36:00.960 --> 36:02.188
I know, right?

36:02.280 --> 36:05.033
I mean, I was even thinking of
writing my own song instead.

36:05.200 --> 36:08.556
Wait, what? Your own song?

36:08.640 --> 36:09.675
Well, yeah.

36:09.760 --> 36:11.273
Look, if you wanna
win that money,

36:11.400 --> 36:13.516
just do what the koala says.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.716
Why? You think
I can't write my own song?

36:15.800 --> 36:17.631
Whoa, whoa!
I'm just saying.

36:17.720 --> 36:19.836
Not everyone
can write songs, okay?

36:20.400 --> 36:23.676
I know I make it look easy, babe.
But it's not.

36:29.160 --> 36:33.278
Oh, here she is!
Quiet down, everybody.

36:35.080 --> 36:37.753
So, Meena!
Are you in the show?

36:38.840 --> 36:41.195
Uh, well, yeah. Kinda. But...

36:42.880 --> 36:44.056
I knew it! I knew it!

36:44.080 --> 36:45.559
She did it!

36:45.680 --> 36:47.955
Oh, I'm so proud of you!
I could pop!

36:48.120 --> 36:50.350
That's my birthday wish
coming true right there!

36:50.440 --> 36:51.509
Way to go, Meena!

36:51.640 --> 36:53.119
Oh, Meena, we love you!

36:53.200 --> 36:54.997
Mom!
What the heck?

36:55.080 --> 36:56.696
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Don't be mad, okay?

36:56.720 --> 36:59.871
It was your Grandma. She told the
whole street about your audition.

36:59.960 --> 37:01.712
Mom, no, wait.
Shush, baby.

37:01.800 --> 37:04.234
You need to save that
singing voice of yours.

37:04.320 --> 37:08.916
So, from now on, just nod
or shake your head, okay?

37:18.640 --> 37:19.709
How was that, Dad?

37:19.840 --> 37:21.796
You're still too soft
on 'em corners, Johnny.

37:22.400 --> 37:23.696
You got to attack 'em.

37:23.720 --> 37:25.278
And you're crunchin'
the gears.

37:25.360 --> 37:27.430
I told you, you got to be
gentle with the...

37:27.520 --> 37:30.478
Look, turn that down.
Oi!

37:30.640 --> 37:32.312
Listen to your father!

37:33.000 --> 37:34.752
"Too soft on
the corners, Johnny."

37:36.480 --> 37:39.392
"You're not doin' it right,
Johnny. Speed up, Johnny."

37:42.120 --> 37:43.348
"Do it like I showed you..."

37:43.520 --> 37:44.999
Whoa!

37:52.560 --> 37:53.788
Dad?

37:53.880 --> 37:55.677
Oh, no, I've run over my dad.

37:57.720 --> 37:59.278
Now, that is
more like it.

38:14.440 --> 38:19.230
And the three
little pigs lived happily ever after.

38:19.320 --> 38:20.912
Good night, my dears.

38:26.840 --> 38:29.354
Norman, are you awake?

38:31.000 --> 38:32.558
How was your day, honey?

38:32.920 --> 38:35.480
Same as always.

38:36.160 --> 38:37.957
It was?
Mmm-hmm.

38:38.640 --> 38:42.235
I don't know how
you do it all, honey.

38:42.360 --> 38:44.555
Good night.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.594
All creatures
great and small,

39:05.160 --> 39:07.754
welcome to the Moon Theater!

39:17.880 --> 39:18.995
Mr. Moon?

39:19.800 --> 39:21.756
I have Judith
from the bank.

39:22.240 --> 39:24.576
What? Oh, no, no. Tell her I'll
call her back in the morning.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.113
I can't.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.428
She's right here.

39:30.960 --> 39:33.030
Judith! Hello!

39:33.440 --> 39:36.034
I work for a bank,
not a charity.

39:36.120 --> 39:38.376
And if your accounts are not
settled by the end of the month...

39:38.400 --> 39:39.469
Okay. Judith...

39:39.640 --> 39:42.950
I personally guarantee by the end of
this month this show is going to be

39:43.120 --> 39:45.315
the biggest hit this city
has ever seen!

39:45.400 --> 39:47.391
Mr. Moon, none of your
shows have ever worked.

39:47.480 --> 39:48.480
None of them!

39:48.640 --> 39:50.073
You've had your chances.

39:50.200 --> 39:54.398
Now settle your accounts or we
will repossess this property!

39:54.520 --> 39:56.238
Okay. Toodle-oo.

39:59.520 --> 40:01.988
What are you gonna do,
Mr. Moon?

40:02.280 --> 40:03.713
Honestly...

40:03.800 --> 40:06.837
Uh, I have no idea.

40:35.040 --> 40:36.439
Are you wearing
a Speedo, Eddie?

40:36.600 --> 40:37.794
What are you...

40:37.880 --> 40:40.110
Eddie,
is everything all right?

40:40.280 --> 40:42.669
Yeah, uh, just doing
my laps, Ma!

40:44.680 --> 40:47.353
So, what, you live
in the pool house now?

40:47.440 --> 40:50.671
Yeah, my folks want me
to be more, you know,

40:50.800 --> 40:52.313
independent, I guess.

40:52.880 --> 40:55.030
They even hooked me up
with this life coach dude.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.076
Life coach?
Yeah.

40:57.160 --> 40:59.628
I guess he's gonna help me
find my purpose in life.

40:59.720 --> 41:00.720
I thought I had one,

41:00.800 --> 41:04.349
but, turns out, it wasn't
the right one or something?

41:04.480 --> 41:05.549
I don't know.

41:05.720 --> 41:08.792
Anyway, he's got me
on this whole schedule thing.

41:08.880 --> 41:10.711
It's like, Mondays,
take out the recycling.

41:10.800 --> 41:13.360
Tuesdays, mow the lawn.
Wednesdays, go visit Nana.

41:13.440 --> 41:14.589
Thursdays, clean the pool.

41:14.680 --> 41:16.696
It's like, don't we have
people to do all this stuff?

41:16.720 --> 41:18.517
Whoa, whoa. Back up.

41:18.600 --> 41:20.272
Your nana is still alive?

41:20.360 --> 41:21.395
Oh, yeah.

41:26.560 --> 41:27.629
Wow.

41:27.720 --> 41:28.835
And she's rich, right?

41:29.120 --> 41:30.155
She's loaded.

41:30.240 --> 41:33.630
But trust me, you don't
wanna go near my nana.

41:35.040 --> 41:36.917
She is one mean sheep.

41:51.160 --> 41:52.593
Now fade up the spot.

41:56.040 --> 41:57.553
Good. Lower the moon.

41:57.720 --> 41:59.039
Coffee?
Thank you, Miss Crawly.

42:00.880 --> 42:04.236
Okay, that's normal.
Just needs a knock.

42:05.160 --> 42:06.434
See? You're getting it.

42:12.280 --> 42:13.998
Anyone seen my glass eye?

42:14.560 --> 42:16.630
The darn thing
keeps popping out.

42:20.280 --> 42:21.280
Whoa!

42:24.520 --> 42:25.520
Oh!

42:27.360 --> 42:28.839
You almost killed me, Jumbo!

42:29.000 --> 42:30.035
It wasn't me.

42:30.200 --> 42:31.553
Oh, is that so?

42:34.760 --> 42:37.035
Pete?

42:39.800 --> 42:41.631
Pete, you're gonna be
all right, okay?

42:41.760 --> 42:43.239
Just hang in there, buddy.

42:45.240 --> 42:47.310
Ricki? Kai?

42:47.400 --> 42:48.799
Why aren't you guys
rehearsing?

42:48.920 --> 42:50.148
We're through!

42:50.240 --> 42:52.629
They said I'm an
intolerable egomaniac.

42:53.160 --> 42:55.799
I don't even know
what that means!

42:57.520 --> 42:59.476
All right.
We're two acts down.

42:59.680 --> 43:01.557
Give me some
good news, Miss Crawly.

43:01.880 --> 43:04.075
Oh, it's not as bad
as it looks.

43:06.800 --> 43:08.597
Oopsie-daisy.

43:08.680 --> 43:10.800
Meena, how would you like
to re-audition for the show?

43:11.120 --> 43:13.156
Really? Well, yeah.

43:13.240 --> 43:14.434
Great!
I mean, no.

43:14.520 --> 43:15.520
What?

43:15.800 --> 43:17.552
I mean, yes, I can sing.

43:17.640 --> 43:21.189
But, no, I get so nervous
and I can't do it.

43:21.280 --> 43:23.510
I mean, I would
totally do it, but...

43:23.600 --> 43:24.999
No, I... No.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.199
I'm gonna take that
as a maybe.

43:29.400 --> 43:30.833
Great! Look, they're back!

43:31.000 --> 43:32.558
We're gonna come back
to this, Meena.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.638
Listen, guys, forget
what I said before.

43:36.720 --> 43:38.790
You are very talented.

43:38.880 --> 43:40.552
Please, join the show. Okay?

43:41.280 --> 43:42.918
Yes? No?

43:43.360 --> 43:44.793
Oh, um...

43:45.280 --> 43:46.349
Here...

43:56.720 --> 43:59.871
What? Hey, no!
Wait, wait, wait! Don't go!

44:04.040 --> 44:05.234
Oh. What is this for?

44:05.800 --> 44:08.030
Now, we use this
to follow the steps.

44:20.120 --> 44:21.712
Caspar! Caspar! No!

44:21.800 --> 44:23.074
How about this? Ha-ha!

44:23.240 --> 44:24.468
Come on! What did I tell you?

44:24.680 --> 44:28.036
I'm so sorry, he had a fever and it
was too late to get a sitter, so...

44:28.120 --> 44:29.896
Well, you seem fine now!

44:29.920 --> 44:30.989
Wow!

44:33.040 --> 44:34.678
Stop!
You're messing it up!

44:34.760 --> 44:35.909
Hey!

44:37.200 --> 44:39.316
I am not singing this.

44:39.480 --> 44:40.549
What's not to like?

44:40.640 --> 44:42.358
You're a female
and you're a teenager.

44:42.440 --> 44:43.555
This song was made for you.

44:43.840 --> 44:45.760
Wow.
It's like you can see inside

44:45.800 --> 44:47.074
my tiny teenage mind.

44:47.200 --> 44:48.315
I know, right?

44:48.400 --> 44:51.392
You just gotta add some moves
and a little bit of...

44:59.200 --> 45:00.200
Go for it!

45:00.360 --> 45:01.918
Oh, you mean like this?

45:07.320 --> 45:09.436
There you go!
You're a natural!

45:15.800 --> 45:17.950
Yes, that was very bad.

45:18.120 --> 45:19.320
Johnny?

45:19.840 --> 45:20.955
Come in. Over.

45:21.120 --> 45:22.678
Oh, Johnny,
your jacket's talking.

45:22.840 --> 45:24.398
Johnny, where are you?

45:24.560 --> 45:26.357
Dad, what's going on? Over.

45:27.240 --> 45:28.656
What do you mean
you gotta leave now?

45:28.680 --> 45:30.318
I know. I'm so sorry.

45:30.400 --> 45:31.816
It's just that I've got
this family business thing.

45:31.840 --> 45:34.479
Do I need to start worrying about
your commitment here, Johnny?

45:34.560 --> 45:36.232
Tell me no.
No. Absolutely not.

45:36.320 --> 45:37.336
I promise it won't
happen again.

45:37.360 --> 45:39.112
It better not.
Thank you, Mr. Moon.

45:42.320 --> 45:43.833
Baby, I'm back.

45:53.240 --> 45:54.753
What is going on here?

45:57.160 --> 45:59.355
Hi, I'm Becky.

45:59.640 --> 46:00.709
Becky?

46:01.360 --> 46:03.999
Hey, what did you expect?
You're never around anymore.

46:04.080 --> 46:06.514
I did it for us, Lance!

46:06.680 --> 46:08.796
You and me!

46:08.920 --> 46:10.512
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.

46:10.680 --> 46:12.671
I think I left
my sunglasses in there.

46:15.560 --> 46:18.074
Come on, Becky.
Let's get out of here.

46:32.360 --> 46:34.078
Jackpot, baby!
Whoo-hoo!

46:34.920 --> 46:37.115
Well, I say we call it
a night there, fellas.

46:37.360 --> 46:39.794
Hey, put the cash in my car,
will you, Derek?

46:41.880 --> 46:44.633
Well, you're one great
card player, Mike.

46:44.920 --> 46:46.433
Not so bad yourself.

46:47.480 --> 46:50.358
Except, I still can't tell
how you cheated.

46:50.520 --> 46:52.351
Cheated? Cheated?

46:52.520 --> 46:54.590
Oh, I am offended.

46:54.680 --> 46:56.511
Come on, baby,
let's cut some rug.

46:59.200 --> 47:01.668
Oh! What the...

47:01.760 --> 47:02.760
Oh.

47:02.880 --> 47:04.154
How did that get there?

47:04.840 --> 47:06.796
Run for it, baby!
Hey!

47:08.960 --> 47:10.029
Get him!

47:18.920 --> 47:19.920
Excuse me!

47:21.440 --> 47:23.271
Don't let him get away!

47:29.560 --> 47:31.551
- Thanks, Derek!
- Out of the way!

47:39.800 --> 47:42.519
So long, suckers!

47:52.680 --> 47:53.874
Good morning, Buster.

47:54.040 --> 47:55.189
Hey, Eddie,
how are you?

47:55.280 --> 47:56.599
Good.
How's the show going?

47:56.680 --> 47:58.033
Ah, it's going great.

47:58.120 --> 48:00.190
And, hey, that's a sharp
jacket you've got on today.

48:00.280 --> 48:01.952
Oh, thanks.

48:02.040 --> 48:03.040
Wait.

48:04.120 --> 48:05.599
What are you
doing here?

48:05.680 --> 48:08.877
Eddie, you can't come visit your nana
without bringing her some flowers.

48:08.960 --> 48:09.960
Here.

48:10.040 --> 48:12.508
- What? No! Buster, no!
- Don't go in there!

48:13.080 --> 48:14.513
Yes, can I help...
Buster!

48:14.640 --> 48:16.631
Ah, Nana!

48:20.840 --> 48:23.434
Just look at you, dear. Wow!

48:23.520 --> 48:25.397
You don't look
a day over 90!

48:25.480 --> 48:26.595
Oh, my gosh!

48:26.760 --> 48:28.318
Buster Moon!

48:28.400 --> 48:30.152
We met at Eddie's graduation.

48:30.240 --> 48:31.468
Oh, lucky me.

48:31.560 --> 48:33.676
A visit from
my useless grandson

48:33.760 --> 48:36.228
and his ghastly
little theater friend.

48:36.320 --> 48:37.958
Look at that,
she remembers me.

48:38.040 --> 48:39.109
Okay, Nana,

48:39.280 --> 48:43.034
how would you like to be the sponsor
for a very prestigious prize?

48:43.120 --> 48:45.998
Not for that singing contest
I saw on the news.

48:46.080 --> 48:47.149
That's the one!

48:47.520 --> 48:49.397
Oh, I see.

48:49.480 --> 48:51.835
You don't have
the money, do you?

48:52.000 --> 48:53.760
Well, we don't quite
have it all locked in...

48:53.840 --> 48:55.592
Well, you'll not get
a cent out of me.

48:55.680 --> 48:56.696
Nana, please
just listen to me...

48:56.720 --> 48:57.755
No, absolutely not.

48:57.840 --> 48:58.909
Don't listen to him, Nana.

48:59.040 --> 49:00.598
I'm not listening
to either of you.

49:00.680 --> 49:03.558
Lapsang souchong. No sugar.
And be quick about it.

49:03.640 --> 49:04.755
Uh, Nana...

49:04.840 --> 49:06.910
I don't know
how to make tea.

49:07.960 --> 49:12.112
Wow. I saw
this show when I was a kid.

49:12.200 --> 49:14.350
Nana, you were
absolutely amazing.

49:14.520 --> 49:17.080
Please, this flattery
is futile.

49:17.160 --> 49:20.072
I have no intention
of bailing you out.

49:20.160 --> 49:21.673
Your pathetic shows
are the reason

49:21.760 --> 49:23.716
that theater no longer
has an audience.

49:23.800 --> 49:26.917
Oh, but this show is gonna pack them
in like it did in the good old days.

49:27.080 --> 49:30.152
They were not good old days,
Mr. Moon.

49:30.360 --> 49:33.033
They were magnificent.

49:33.240 --> 49:35.117
And that theater of yours,

49:35.320 --> 49:38.949
it was a palace of wonder
and magic.

49:39.160 --> 49:40.434
But, Nana, it still is.

49:40.600 --> 49:42.158
Yeah, right. Ow!

49:42.240 --> 49:45.835
I can recall the ushers
in their velvet suits.

49:46.200 --> 49:49.351
Queues a mile long
just to get a ticket.

49:49.440 --> 49:54.116
The curtain rising over
that glorious stage.

49:54.280 --> 49:57.909
Music and light bringing
dreams to life?

49:58.080 --> 49:59.308
Precisely.

49:59.480 --> 50:01.675
Well, it's just like
you remember it.

50:01.760 --> 50:04.638
In fact, I've made it
even more spectacular.

50:04.760 --> 50:05.909
No, you haven't.
Shh.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.072
Come see for yourself. A special
performance just for you.

50:09.160 --> 50:10.229
What do you say, Nana?

50:10.880 --> 50:13.633
I say, you are a liar,
Mr. Moon.

50:14.360 --> 50:15.475
Okay, well...

50:15.600 --> 50:16.919
We're done now.
Thank you, Nana.

50:17.080 --> 50:19.355
But anything's better than
spending another evening

50:19.440 --> 50:21.271
playing checkers
with this old fart.

50:21.360 --> 50:22.395
What?

50:22.480 --> 50:24.789
Great! It's gonna
blow you away, Nana.

50:24.880 --> 50:26.598
And that is no lie!

50:27.400 --> 50:28.515
Now, listen up!

50:28.760 --> 50:31.194
Tomorrow we're going to have
a full preview of the show.

50:31.280 --> 50:34.636
And our audience will be none
other than Miss Nana Noodleman.

50:34.800 --> 50:37.155
Nana Noodleman?
She's still alive?

50:37.600 --> 50:39.397
Oh, yes, and believe me,

50:39.480 --> 50:41.675
she's got some pretty high
standards, all right.

50:41.760 --> 50:43.955
So, today we're gonna have
a full dress rehearsal.

50:44.040 --> 50:46.235
And I want to see you
light up the stage, folks!

50:46.320 --> 50:47.320
Well, that's cool.

50:47.440 --> 50:48.440
Meena, Miss Crawly...

50:49.120 --> 50:51.839
- What do you think?
- Wow, it's so ambitious.

50:51.960 --> 50:53.120
Yeah, are you sure
about this?

50:53.160 --> 50:55.515
I promised Nana
something spectacular.

50:55.600 --> 50:56.999
And this...

50:57.080 --> 50:58.798
It's gonna blow her away.
Oh, yes.

50:58.880 --> 51:00.154
Two minutes, everybody.

51:00.800 --> 51:02.000
Johnny?

51:02.280 --> 51:03.793
Johnny, where are you?

51:05.720 --> 51:08.029
Johnny? Answer
the walkie-talkie.

51:08.560 --> 51:10.296
Yeah, Dad. I'm here.
I'm here. What's wrong?

51:10.320 --> 51:12.470
We got the call.
Shipment's coming in.

51:12.560 --> 51:14.152
Tonight?
Not tonight.

51:14.240 --> 51:15.559
Now.

51:15.640 --> 51:18.154
Meet us on the corner of
Hector Street in two minutes.

51:30.280 --> 51:32.919
Stay here.
We'll be back in exactly 37...

51:33.000 --> 51:35.673
Yeah, 37 minutes. Yep.
You've told me repeatedly.

51:42.680 --> 51:43.795
I can make it.

51:49.280 --> 51:51.840
Bravo, Mike.
Nana is gonna love that!

51:52.440 --> 51:54.317
Aw, you're too kind, Mr. Moon.

51:54.400 --> 51:56.436
And I myself
am loving the new suit, sir.

51:56.520 --> 51:58.795
Okay, can we see Ash next,
please?

51:59.600 --> 52:01.477
Ash, let's get you out here!

52:02.400 --> 52:05.119
Oh! Stand back.
Moody teenager coming through.

52:05.200 --> 52:06.235
Good luck, Ash.

52:39.080 --> 52:40.080
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

52:40.160 --> 52:42.754
Okay. Enough of that!
Cut it! Cut it!

52:44.520 --> 52:46.216
I don't think anyone's gonna
call her after that.

52:46.240 --> 52:47.559
Okay, Ash. Um...

52:48.360 --> 52:49.759
Hey, come on, Ash.

52:51.120 --> 52:52.872
What is it?
Do you not like the dress?

52:54.760 --> 52:57.228
Ow! Ow!

52:57.440 --> 52:58.634
Ash, what's wrong?

53:06.280 --> 53:10.512
Well, it sounds to me like you are
way better off without that...

53:10.600 --> 53:13.558
That total super-jerk
dinkleschplatt!

53:13.640 --> 53:16.950
Exactly. Total super-jerk
dinkleschplatt!

53:17.040 --> 53:18.678
Rosita! Gunter!
You're on next!

53:18.760 --> 53:19.795
Yeah, okay, here.

53:19.880 --> 53:21.496
There should be some gum or
some candy in there somewhere.

53:21.520 --> 53:22.520
Just help yourself.

53:23.320 --> 53:24.753
Rosita! Rosita!
Wait! Wait! Wait!

53:25.800 --> 53:27.119
Can I take your place,
please?

53:27.200 --> 53:28.256
Sure, Johnny, go ahead.

53:28.280 --> 53:31.636
Okay, get ready, 'cause I'm
warning you...

53:31.720 --> 53:35.269
This stage is about to explode
with major piggy power!

53:36.000 --> 53:38.992
I am so sorry.
I have no control.

53:39.760 --> 53:40.760
Oh!

53:41.880 --> 53:42.915
Yeah!

53:43.760 --> 53:45.876
Okay, come on,
you can do this.

53:52.360 --> 53:53.395
Are you okay?

53:54.040 --> 53:55.598
Oh, yes, I'm fine,
thank you.

53:56.280 --> 53:57.474
How are you?

53:57.600 --> 53:59.636
Okay, Johnny!
Let's get you out here!

53:59.720 --> 54:02.518
And you guys, you've got
to work on that routine!

54:02.600 --> 54:03.999
Take it away, Johnny!

54:16.040 --> 54:19.589
You can't just sing it, you've
got to show the fire and desire!

54:19.680 --> 54:22.148
The fire went out
a long time ago.

54:22.240 --> 54:25.391
What? Look, I can't even
keep count of the steps!

54:25.600 --> 54:27.556
Ugh! Counting schmounting!

54:27.640 --> 54:30.279
She sings too much
with her head, right?

54:31.320 --> 54:32.355
Ja, ja, see?

54:32.440 --> 54:34.590
Forget the steps
and just like...

54:34.680 --> 54:37.194
Let the music take control
of your body parts.

54:37.320 --> 54:40.995
My body parts are not responding, okay?
It's never gonna happen.

54:42.200 --> 54:43.599
I should just
be getting groceries.

54:43.680 --> 54:45.318
Rosita, no...
Rosita, come on!

54:45.400 --> 54:46.833
Please, like, don't go.

54:48.520 --> 54:51.318
Psst!
Hey! Hey! Down here.

54:52.600 --> 54:54.716
Have you seen three
nasty-looking bears out there?

54:56.080 --> 54:57.957
Uh, no.
Oh, great.

54:58.040 --> 55:00.270
Hey, by the way,
I love your act. Seriously.

55:00.400 --> 55:02.120
The part where you
fall flat on your face...

55:02.200 --> 55:04.794
That cracks me up
every time.

55:04.880 --> 55:06.154
See you around, porky.

55:15.720 --> 55:16.755
Aw, man.

55:17.040 --> 55:19.190
Johnny, uh, I know
I'm asking a lot of you...

55:19.280 --> 55:21.191
Mr. Moon, I'm really trying,
I promise.

55:21.880 --> 55:23.960
What about your backup song?
Have you practiced that?

55:24.040 --> 55:25.996
Uh, well, not yet.

55:26.080 --> 55:29.072
Well, why don't we go back
and work on that one, okay?

55:29.160 --> 55:33.073
I mean, look, if you play like
that in front of Nana Noodleman...

55:35.040 --> 55:36.075
Johnny?

55:44.240 --> 55:45.468
Hey!

56:04.280 --> 56:06.669
We are set
for life now, boys!

56:07.040 --> 56:09.156
Oh. Oh. What's going on?

56:09.240 --> 56:10.275
Where's Johnny?

56:10.440 --> 56:11.589
He's not here.

56:14.840 --> 56:15.989
Run!

56:28.160 --> 56:30.390
Oh! I'm dead.

56:41.960 --> 56:43.598
Okay, wait, let me see...

56:52.000 --> 56:53.831
No, Mom, I have not
made any friends.

56:53.920 --> 56:55.512
What do you think this is,
kindergarten?

56:55.640 --> 56:58.016
If you hadn't squealed to the cops,
I wouldn't be in here right now.

56:58.040 --> 56:59.256
Honey, when are you
getting out?

56:59.280 --> 57:01.236
I'm only gonna be in here
for a few years.

57:01.320 --> 57:02.673
Well, where'd you
hide the money?

57:03.520 --> 57:04.520
Where were you?

57:04.600 --> 57:07.478
Um, well, the thing is,
I went to get gas...

57:07.560 --> 57:08.595
Don't lie to me!

57:09.520 --> 57:11.431
Um, I was at a rehearsal.

57:11.680 --> 57:13.671
Rehearsal? For what?

57:14.120 --> 57:16.759
I was at a singing contest.

57:18.400 --> 57:19.515
Look, Dad...

57:20.120 --> 57:22.793
I'm sorry, I just don't want
to be in your gang.

57:22.880 --> 57:24.199
I want to be a singer.

57:24.240 --> 57:27.516
Singer? Look, Dad, no, it's okay.
I can get the bail money.

57:27.600 --> 57:29.556
There's a prize.
It's $ 100,000.

57:33.520 --> 57:36.193
How did I end up
with a son like you, eh?

57:36.880 --> 57:38.393
You're nothing like me.

57:38.840 --> 57:41.070
You never were
and you never will be.

57:41.160 --> 57:44.357
I'll get you out! Dad, wait!
I'll get the money. I promise!

58:20.920 --> 58:24.276
Johnny!
You gave me a fright there.

58:24.400 --> 58:26.436
Sorry, I didn't mean to.
I just...

58:27.040 --> 58:30.476
Well, I know it's late, but I could
really use some extra piano lessons.

58:33.120 --> 58:34.120
Ah-ha.

58:35.880 --> 58:37.677
Mmm. That's it.

58:39.400 --> 58:40.515
That's good.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.228
You're getting it.

58:51.600 --> 58:52.656
Shoppers are reminded

58:52.680 --> 58:55.114
the store will close
in 15 minutes. Thank you.

59:57.080 --> 59:58.672
The lady in aisle six...

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.079
That was awesome.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:06.480
All right.

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:10.473
Mr. Moon,
are you sure this is legal?

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.437
Uh, I don't know.

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:14.880
But if you keep asking questions,
we'll never get this done.

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:16.795
Now, hit it!

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.035
Oh!
Ahh!

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:23.834
A little higher.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.439
There it is! Thank you!

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:47.440
Hey!

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:48.869
Posters up!

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.395
You...
Now, run away!

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:53.391
Come back here, you vandals!

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.911
Rosita, have you seen my car...
Whoa!

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.589
Rosita? What the...

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.795
What's going on?

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:23.074
Rosita!

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.430
Kids, where's Mommy?

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.160
Phew!

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.113
How's that, Miss Crawly?

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.160
Hey!
Oh!

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.080
Sorry!

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.953
Mr. Moon would like everyone to
meet backstage before she arrives.

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:57.320
Wow.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:58.800
You wrote that?

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:01.794
Uh, yeah. Do you like it?

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.633
Are you kidding?
It's fantastic!

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.432
You've got to
sing that today!

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.349
Mike, you're on first.

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.351
Sure. Just a second here.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:12.440
Honey, I'm busy.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:13.669
What? I can't hear you.

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:16.917
Rosita and Gunter,
you're on after Mike.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.911
You got it, boss.
Rosita!

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.151
Super cool!
You've, like, totally come back!

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.151
Okay, Johnny, you follow them.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.198
What? Oh, yeah.
I'm ready. Yeah, yeah.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.280
Ash, you're...

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:29.548
After Johnny. I got it.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.193
And Meena. Last chance, kid.

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.390
You wanna join these guys
out there today?

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:36.512
I would...
I just get so scared.

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:37.680
Sure, you do.

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:39.955
But you know
how to get over that, right?

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.473
Uh, no.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:43.756
You just start singing!

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.360
Do what you love,
then you'll be great,

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:46.576
'cause you won't
be afraid anymore,

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:47.976
because you'll actually
be doing it.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.069
Right?

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.599
Uh...

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:53.114
Look, do you love to sing?

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.758
I mean, do you
really love it?

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.389
Of course I do.

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.959
Then you face this
head on, Meena.

01:02:58.680 --> 01:02:59.696
Look, it's like
my dad always said,

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:02.632
"Don't let fear stop you from
doing the thing you love."

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.590
Uh...
Okay, I'll do it.

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:07.318
Great!
Mr. Moon!

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:08.955
She's here!

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.480
Nana!

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:28.194
Oh! Do not even think
of embracing me.

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:31.352
You got it. Eddie, please show
your nana to the royal box.

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:34.716
Oh, for heaven sakes!
I'm perfectly capable of walking.

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:37.597
You nervous?
Are you kidding?

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:40.148
I'm absolutely terrified.

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:49.997
Boss, that's his car,
isn't it? Right there!

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:52.755
Pull over.

01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:01.235
Lapsang souchong,
courtesy of Mr. Moon...

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.870
Oh...
Wonderful.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.456
Honey,
the show is starting, all right?

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.436
I can't talk now. I gotta go.

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:13.555
Of course I love you.

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:15.720
You think I'd buy you diamond
earrings if I didn't...

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:17.910
Where is my money?

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.456
Okay, okay, listen, listen.

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:22.836
I just, maybe, kind of,
spent it all.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.280
You know?

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.816
No, no, please, please, wait!
I'll give you the money!

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:28.831
I'll get you $100,000!

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.998
Where are you going
to get that kind of money?

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:34.115
Moon! Okay?

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.035
Moon's got my money.

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:39.750
Who is this "Moon"?

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:48.188
All creatures great and small,
welcome to the Moon Theater!

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.919
I am your host,
Buster Moon, and...

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.514
Whoa!

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.388
Okay. Behold!

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:03.156
The very first stage
lit entirely by squid power!

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:12.360
Yeah!

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:15.474
Beautiful work, guys. Now,
just follow me on the beat.

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.998
And as you can see,
this is no ordinary theater.

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:24.436
This is a palace
of wonder and magic.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.991
He's done it!
He's really done it, Nana!

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.676
Oh! Goodness!

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.149
Now, welcome
our first contestant.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.032
Whoa!

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.599
Which one of you is Moon?

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.756
Hey, hey, you can't
just barge in here!

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:42.398
You know this guy?

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:44.353
Mike?
Right.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:47.910
Mike here says you got his money,
and it's in that box.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.236
No, no, just hold on
a moment here.

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:55.313
That's prize money, and it's not
Mike's unless he wins it fair and...

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:58.637
Give him the money! Okay! Okay!
Hey, hey, take it! The whole chest!

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:00.591
It's yours, okay?
All right here.

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:01.999
Open it.
Open it?

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:03.520
Me?

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.229
Open it!

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:06.753
Okay, no...

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:08.398
I just don't have the keys.

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:09.833
So, maybe you can
come back later?

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:11.632
Get outta the way!

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.236
No, no, no! Wait!

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.913
Hey, there you go!

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:24.156
Big guy with a bat!
Who needs keys, right?

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.320
All right. Well, let's get
this thing squared up now.

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:28.709
What the...

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:30.160
That's it?

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.513
That's all there is?

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:34.995
He lied.

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.679
Moon lied to us all!

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.318
Wait a second.
I can explain...

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:42.176
He's your problem, not me.
This is just a prop.

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:43.713
So where's the $100,000?

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.240
You're kidding!

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.016
I cannot believe you
lied to us this whole time.

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.314
Huge waste
of everyone's...

01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:49.440
This was just...

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.680
Buster! Look out!

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:10.919
I'm stuck!

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:38.878
Buster!
It's falling! Let go!

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:52.155
Whoa! Whoa!

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.829
Okay, okay.
Steady, girl. Steady.

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:20.917
No, no, no!

01:08:24.279 --> 01:08:25.279
Oh!

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:27.870
Ah! Is everyone okay?

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:29.194
Nana!

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:32.675
I'm so sorry! I just...

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.031
No, no, don't go!

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:38.395
Has anyone seen my glass eye?

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:39.800
Oh...

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.520
It's right here, Miss Crawly.
I've got it.

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:48.915
Look out!

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:13.995
No.

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:31.948
Oh, Dad.

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.513
I'm so sorry.

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:46.033
Where is Mike?

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:48.555
He must be dead.

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.118
Come on, let's go!

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.072
Mommy, where are you?

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.837
Help!
Oh, my gosh!

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.120
Help!

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:05.997
Hold on! Mommy's here!

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:15.336
I'm
standing at the scene right now, Judy.

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.759
And I can tell you,

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:19.957
it is a miracle anyone survived
this unbelievable disaster.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:59.476
Yeah, Buster Moon certainly brought
down the house once and for all today.

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:02.791
And although Mr. Moon has not
been available for questions,

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:04.199
unconfirmed reports suggest

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.590
he was responsible
for building a water tank

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:08.910
that exploded
and flooded the building.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.911
I've been told
the 250 squid

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.616
who had been part of Moon's display
are in fact...

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.234
Eddie? There's someone
at the door.

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:19.320
And that none of
them were harmed during the incident.

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:22.193
Whether they will be returning to
their usual work is not yet...

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:25.035
Oh, no.

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:26.954
Mr. Moon?

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:31.880
Come on, Moon. You can't just
hide out in your buddy's pool house.

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:34.793
Yeah, we just wanna make
sure you're all right, that's all.

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:40.110
Hey, Mr. Moon.
You okay?

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:44.034
Guys, look. I'm sorry
about what happened...

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:45.473
And the prize money and...

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.039
Oh, it's okay.

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:49.475
No. None of this is okay.

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:51.073
At least we're all
in one piece.

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.349
Yeah, and you know what?

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:54.954
I bet we can find some other
place to put the show on.

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.479
- Right?
- Yeah!

01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:00.314
The show?
Guys, I'm done.

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:04.236
Are you serious?
What do you mean, "done"? Come on!

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:06.551
Didn't you see this?
Huh?

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:09.553
Look, it says
I'm a "danger to society."

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:13.877
"A deluded,
washed-up charlatan

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:16.110
"who never had
a hit in his career."

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:18.071
Oh, come on,
you don't believe all that?

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.311
Yeah. I do.

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:23.056
Listen. You're not the
only one who lost something here.

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:24.354
- We all did.
- Ja!

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:28.149
I mean, I lost any chance of ever
speaking to my dad again over this show.

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.874
- Sorry.
- Oh, Mr. Moon, don't...

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:32.880
Forget about it.

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:34.911
What is this?
I don't understand.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.433
Come on,
let's get out of here.

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:41.599
Mr. Moon?

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:43.553
Meena, please...

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:46.830
I baked a cake for you
'cause...

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:51.789
Well, I know you're sad right now and
probably afraid to try again and...

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.074
Yeah, I am afraid.

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:55.118
I'm afraid that this...

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:56.997
This, me, right now,
this is who I am.

01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:58.559
This is my lot for life.

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:01.074
That I'm not the guy
that my dad wanted me to be.

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.275
Not by a million miles.

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:03.360
But you told me...

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:05.198
What? What did I say?

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.349
Well, you know...

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.715
"Don't let fear stop you from
doing the thing you love."

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:11.917
Ugh! That's just a bunch
of stupid, corny...

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:15.749
No, it's not. What? You really believe
that you're gonna be a singer?

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:16.840
Well, yeah, maybe...

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:19.155
Well, then you're just
as big a fool as I am!

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.235
Look, kid...

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.396
You and me, we're both

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:25.913
afraid for good reason.

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:27.953
'Cause deep down, we know...

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:31.477
We just don't have
what it takes.

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:09.316
I'm awake, I'm awake!

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:12.595
Hey, Buster.

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.079
Hey, Eddie.

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:15.798
Man, where'd you go?
Are you okay?

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:19.156
Listen, could you meet me at the
corner of Dinsdale and Lemington?

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:20.559
Now?

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:22.039
Yeah, please.

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:23.993
And could you...

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:26.469
Ahem. Could you bring me
a spare Speedo?

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:28.868
Speedo?

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:36.629
Hey, Miss Crawly.

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:38.552
Oh! Hello, Eddie!

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.232
Hey, did you
bring the Speedo?

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.709
The...
Oh, yeah. Uh, here.

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:45.400
Great. You're a real pal, Eddie.

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:48.796
Oh! Our first customer!

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:50.336
Miss Crawly, fill the bucket.

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:51.395
Be right with you, sir.

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:54.394
Wait, what are you doing?

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:56.312
The only other job I know.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.958
I'm just glad
my dad isn't here to see this.

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:04.913
Miss Crawly, if you would...
Oh!

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:07.160
Thanks.

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:09.435
Well, gotta go to work.

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:11.159
Uh, I'll see you around,
Eddie.

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:31.590
Come on!
I ain't got all day!

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.269
Aw, forget it.

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:35.919
Too slow, dude.

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.120
Whoa!

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:43.959
One moment,
please, sir!

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:47.638
Well, you know the good thing
about hitting rock bottom?

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:51.511
There's only one way
left to go. And that's up.

01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:54.714
Come on.
You wash. I'll dry.

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:00.751
Thank you, Miss Crawly.

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:42.519
Buster, where you going?

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:28.358
I, uh...

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:32.073
Do you think you could sing like
that in front of a real audience?

01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:36.270
I don't know.
But I wanna try.

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:38.113
Good.

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:39.315
'Cause I wanna see it.

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:43.555
We are? Seriously?

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:46.188
Oh, my gosh! Okay, yes.
I'll be right over.

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:50.393
Hello?

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:51.834
Oh, hello, Mr. Moon.

01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:56.736
Some say he's
the worst showman this city's ever seen.

01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:58.352
Some say he's
a walking disaster.

01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:00.550
A loose cannon.

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:01.789
Well, tomorrow night,

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:06.038
the name Buster Moon will go down in
entertainment history once and for all,

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:09.755
as he and this bunch of bumbling
amateurs attempt to re-stage the show

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:12.351
that brought down his theater.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.195
Ah, don't you worry, Mike,
all is forgiven.

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.616
Just glad you're back
in one piece.

01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:01.976
Oh, yeah, you're
too kind, Mr. Moon.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.036
And, uh,
the prize money?

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.236
I mean, it's real
this time, right?

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.550
There is no prize money
'cause there's no competition.

01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:10.136
Tonight, you're singing
for yourselves.

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:11.832
Two minutes, everybody!
Final checks.

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:13.114
Singing for ourselves?

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:15.392
Unbelievable.

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:17.750
Who's he... This is crazy.
I'm outta here.

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:19.833
Hello!

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:22.559
We're putting on a show here.

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:24.756
You all should
come and see it!

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:26.353
You! Come on!

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:28.954
Come on, fella!
It's gonna be really good!

01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:32.352
Hey! How's our new
stagehand getting on?

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:33.475
He's learning fast.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.835
All set and standing by!
I love this headset!

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:37.956
The audience are
in their seats, Mr. Moon.

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.040
Great!

01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:40.959
Hmm.

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:42.235
Caspar!

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.440
That's all?
Get your pants back on, young man!

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:47.837
Please, you guys, please.
Please sit down!

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.956
Hey! Put your shoes
back on right now!

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:52.349
Zoe, I saw that! Stop it!

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:55.473
And, Leo, that is disgusting.

01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:58.518
Well, John, I've covered many
disasters for this network,

01:19:58.600 --> 01:19:59.828
but this is sure to...

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:01.720
Oh, they're about to start.

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:03.558
Okay, guys, listen up!

01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:05.437
Look, I gotta tell you, um,

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:08.557
there's not much of
an audience out there tonight.

01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:10.119
But you know what?

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:11.559
It doesn't matter.

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:13.631
It really doesn't.

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:16.394
'Cause tonight is our night.

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:18.232
And whatever happens,

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:22.550
I just want you all to know how proud
I am to be a part of this with you.

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:24.553
Good luck, Mr. Moon.

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:25.920
Good luck, everyone...
Whoa!

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:31.994
Whoop! Uh...

01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:33.832
Sorry. Just jumped
the cue there.

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:36.070
Don't worry. I'm gonna
get the hang of this.

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:43.069
Here we go.

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:51.553
All creatures
great and small...

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:53.437
...welcome to the...

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:56.588
Oh, hello, there.

01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:58.592
Great!

01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:01.558
Welcome to our newly
refurbished, open-air theater.

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:03.275
You ready, big guy?

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:04.469
Yeah.

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:06.039
I'm, like, totally ready.

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:07.269
All right!

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:09.428
Let's do this.

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:11.716
Gunter and Rosita!

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.518
Are you getting this?

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.313
Whoa!

01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:37.794
Aren't they great?

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:40.520
What, are you kidding me?
It's like watching Jell-O dancing around.

01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:43.200
Like you could do
any better, pip-squeak.

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:46.073
All right, all right. Hey!

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:49.550
You wanna see something great?
I'll show you great.

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:23.350
Gunter and Rosita!

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:26.398
Kids! No!
Back to your seats!

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.670
Okay, okay. Whoa!

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:30.638
Norman!

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:38.995
All right!

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.036
Piggy power! Ha-ha!

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:46.715
That was great!

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:51.272
Well, it seems I'm not the only
one who actually enjoyed that.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.920
Crowds are beginning to
arrive at the scene.

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:55.675
Help!

01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:57.358
I'm so sorry, Mr. Moon.

01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:58.953
Johnny, you're on next.

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:44.159
What is that?

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.117
Turn it down, will ya?

01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:48.160
Oi...

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:51.033
Didn't you hear me?
I said, turn it...

01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:53.309
Johnny?

01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:01.348
Johnny.

01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:04.993
It's Johnny!

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:06.513
That's my son!

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:12.360
My son...

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:26.589
What the...
Hey!

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:29.720
Hey, hey, hey!

01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:23.832
What about that, huh?

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:25.592
Give it up for Johnny, folks!

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.835
What's with the face?
You were great!

01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:41.955
They loved you!

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:45.592
Yeah, thanks, Rosita.

01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:59.598
All right.
Welcome to all you newcomers!

01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:02.148
You are just in time
to meet a teenager

01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:04.515
who was recently dumped
by her boyfriend.

01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:07.069
I know, right?

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:11.114
But she's gonna chase those blues
away with a song of her very own.

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:14.237
Allow me to introduce
the singing sensation...

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:15.320
Ash!

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:32.960
Judith?

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:35.830
You are all trespassing
on private property.

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:37.296
What? And you will
leave right now.

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:38.833
No, no, no. Judith...

01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:39.960
All of you!

01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:19.717
I am calling the police.

01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:50.079
Ugh. Seriously?
She's not even that good.

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:52.799
Yeah, yeah. Totally.

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:51.392
Uh...

01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:53.232
You guys okay?

01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:00.152
Ash! Ash! Ash!

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:04.392
What about that?

01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:08.393
We just witnessed the birth
of a genuine rock star!

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:10.914
Moon, you've got
some stuck here.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Ow!

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:24.673
He may be tiny,

01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:27.115
but there's no denying
his enormous talent.

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:30.671
Would you please
welcome to the stage, Mike!

01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:32.439
What are you
doing back here?

01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:33.680
Relax, sweetheart.

01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:36.479
Just came back to show you
bozos how it's really done.

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:38.118
Now, watch this.

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:10.999
Boss! That is him!

01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:12.428
That is Mike!

01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:54.911
I'm so proud of you.

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:06.920
Uh-oh.

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:17.268
You gotta be
kidding me.

01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:50.632
Negative. I've lost sight of the
suspect and am terminating pursuit.

01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:11.355
That pip-squeak
really was great.

01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:14.517
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:16.637
Oh, please,
you're too kind, really.

01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:18.119
Look at me, I'm turning red.

01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:19.918
Stop! I can't take it.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.069
Keep it coming.

01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:23.073
Well, I better get back.

01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:25.350
They'll be wondering
what happened to me.

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:27.239
You'll visit me though, yeah?

01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:28.834
Yeah, course I will.

01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:32.034
See you, son.

01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:46.196
We have one
final act for you tonight.

01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:48.430
Would you please welcome
to the stage

01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:50.795
for her first ever
live appearance,

01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:51.915
Meena!

01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:56.394
Meena?

01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:58.719
Is she coming out?

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:01.592
Meena, what's wrong?
Are you okay?

01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:03.837
I... I can't move.

01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:06.718
I'm... I'm terrified.

01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:10.673
Give me your hand, kid.

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:13.949
Okay, deep breaths.

01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:17.073
Deep breaths,
and remember what I told you.

01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:22.188
You will not feel afraid anymore
if you just start singing.

01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:23.469
Meena!

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:24.560
Meena!

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:29.152
Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry!

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:33.074
Uh...

01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:34.469
Okay.

01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:37.152
Uh...

01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:42.439
Sing.

01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:44.869
Okay.

01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:17.120
Whoo-hoo!

01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:24.715
Guys, guys, wait.
We can talk this over, right?

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:27.070
We're all reasonable
individuals here.

01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:32.909
Get in! Quick!

01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:34.668
Oh, thank you, sweetheart!

01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:37.872
Whew! That was close!
Yeah.

01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:39.315
Come on!

01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:22.639
She did it!

01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:24.348
Go, go!

01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:36.712
Oh, Dad, I wish
you could see this.

01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:56.073
Everybody ready?

01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:59.558
All creatures
great and small,

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.312
welcome to
the New Moon Theater!
