00:11.272 --> 00:14.015
I am never going to let you go.

00:14.065 --> 00:16.478
- _
- Elena Ledesma was being kept in a coma?

00:16.544 --> 00:19.159
- And experimented on.
- By Doctor Khatri?

00:19.194 --> 00:19.951
Yes.

00:21.732 --> 00:23.339
This is the place. In the film.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.478
She is a Russian soldier.

00:31.135 --> 00:33.729
You're telling me so many lies, Freya.

00:34.709 --> 00:37.140
- Forgive me.
- NO!

00:37.260 --> 00:39.428
In the bay! There's a body.

01:44.702 --> 01:46.077
The lock's been broken.

02:02.185 --> 02:04.719
This place is supposed to be abandoned.

02:11.930 --> 02:13.799
Sounds like a petrol engine.

02:41.653 --> 02:42.861
Jesus.

02:43.318 --> 02:44.819
Is that a head?

02:49.901 --> 02:51.224
Oh, fuck!

02:55.620 --> 02:57.023
You shouldn't have come.

02:57.086 --> 02:58.602
AH!

03:28.964 --> 03:31.234
I'm off to work now, darling.

03:31.335 --> 03:32.768
I'll see you tonight.

03:50.955 --> 03:51.928
Hi.

03:56.865 --> 03:59.796
I should... I should get to work.

04:00.745 --> 04:03.569
It's okay. My mum, she always sleeps late.

04:06.281 --> 04:12.005
You know, for me, things
are a bit complicated.

04:15.345 --> 04:16.368
Yeah.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.849
I have an unbelievable hangover.

04:23.345 --> 04:24.745
Everyone has.

05:00.825 --> 05:02.564
Do you trust me, Mr. Anderssen?

05:02.630 --> 05:04.798
Of course I fucking don't.

05:06.825 --> 05:08.173
Hypothesis.

05:09.570 --> 05:13.212
You were infected by parasitic wasp
larvae. You were trapped somewhere.

05:13.274 --> 05:15.773
Or you trapped yourself.
And you didn't die.

05:16.175 --> 05:19.562
And the last time anything
like that happened was in 1942.

05:20.250 --> 05:24.297
The wasp larvae carry a microscopic
parasite into their host.

05:24.356 --> 05:26.006
The host usually dies.

05:26.076 --> 05:29.790
But if it doesn't, I believe
the parasite can somehow alter

05:29.825 --> 05:32.638
its genetic code.

05:32.698 --> 05:35.749
The host develops great
physical resilience.

05:35.832 --> 05:38.642
It's able to regenerate tissue and organs.

05:38.723 --> 05:43.185
It can even pull bodies out of the
Arctic water without noticing the cold.

05:43.884 --> 05:46.555
My genetic code has changed?

05:46.600 --> 05:48.035
I think it's possible.

05:49.784 --> 05:52.989
I'm not human?

05:53.065 --> 05:58.500
Of course you're human. You're
just... different, unique.

06:02.169 --> 06:08.465
Another side effect of this genetic
change is uncontrollable violence.

06:11.865 --> 06:13.316
A monster!

06:13.384 --> 06:15.116
I didn't say that.

06:16.543 --> 06:17.584
A demon.

06:17.634 --> 06:21.044
It's not your fault. You're
just sick. Come with me.

06:21.865 --> 06:25.510
Somewhere safe. Somewhere you
can't hurt yourself or anyone else.

06:25.593 --> 06:28.177
Help me find a cure. Help me help you.

06:28.247 --> 06:30.947
- Nobody can help me.
- It's not too late.

06:34.287 --> 06:39.024
She was awake when you cut her open.

06:49.458 --> 06:51.511
Don't leave town, Mr. Anderssen.

07:22.567 --> 07:25.839
_

07:48.633 --> 07:50.737
Do we know how it happened?

07:52.721 --> 07:56.726
I had a look at, erm... erm... at Hildur...

07:56.785 --> 07:58.489
It's okay.

07:58.594 --> 08:01.556
She died in the water,
before she could drown.

08:01.642 --> 08:04.688
The cold would have shut down her organs.

08:04.723 --> 08:09.735
She was unharmed, apart from
some light bruising on her wrists.

08:11.065 --> 08:12.470
That was me.

08:12.525 --> 08:17.070
We had a fight. The last time I saw her.

08:17.127 --> 08:19.360
I held her wrists.

08:21.742 --> 08:26.950
You, erm... mustn't blame
yourself. Take some time off.

08:26.985 --> 08:30.128
We'll handle the formalities.

08:32.025 --> 08:38.789
Lars Ulvinaune saw her walking
in a daze towards the bay.

08:38.876 --> 08:44.230
She was distressed. And also
standing out there by the water.

08:44.265 --> 08:45.840
Where she was found.

08:46.666 --> 08:48.465
You're saying she killed herself?

08:51.505 --> 08:57.553
Because I wouldn't listen. Because
I couldn't see what she needed.

08:57.618 --> 08:59.186
And now she's dead.

09:05.226 --> 09:06.276
Dead.

09:12.290 --> 09:13.735
Dead.

09:13.867 --> 09:17.633
Er... Eric, err, pl... please.

09:18.524 --> 09:19.696
Dead.

09:20.147 --> 09:21.002
Dead.

09:27.156 --> 09:31.212
DEAD! DEAD! DEAD! DEAD!

09:31.247 --> 09:33.248
DEAD! DEAD!

09:33.985 --> 09:35.065
Eric.

09:37.625 --> 09:38.924
Go get drunk.

09:40.865 --> 09:42.187
That's an order.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.751
We can take it from here.

10:20.650 --> 10:23.122
I'm the governor. You're on sick leave.

10:23.157 --> 10:26.242
I'm not sick. And I'm not leaving.

10:26.410 --> 10:28.398
It looks like suicide, Dan.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.870
Suicide?

10:30.905 --> 10:32.554
She and Eric had separated.

10:32.589 --> 10:34.177
They had a terrible fight.

10:34.232 --> 10:36.070
Petter Hansen said they
nearly killed each other.

10:36.105 --> 10:40.790
And she was depressed because she
was sacked for defending Fortitude.

10:40.910 --> 10:43.510
Hildur was depressed.

10:43.545 --> 10:50.575
Also she'd been drinking,
in her room, and making wild

10:50.645 --> 10:53.134
allegations against the government.

10:53.746 --> 10:58.979
I should've stopped her, I
should've talked to her, but...

11:00.025 --> 11:04.355
Where's her stuff? Her bag.
Her car. Find it. Find it all.

11:04.394 --> 11:08.599
You're not the Sheriff
here! You don't give orders!

11:12.722 --> 11:17.144
There is a killer hiding somewhere
here, there is a sick woman

11:17.179 --> 11:20.169
who... who'll die unless she gets help.

11:20.204 --> 11:25.117
- We must focus our priorities.
- Yes. But there's only two of us.

11:28.410 --> 11:33.446
Okay, okay... you can help,

11:33.505 --> 11:38.560
on a consultancy basis, and
you report directly to me.

11:38.626 --> 11:41.066
Everyone reports to me.

11:47.894 --> 11:51.253
He... he's drinking, Dan.

11:51.341 --> 11:52.547
Who isn't?

12:25.385 --> 12:27.230
What shall we do, Dan?

12:27.265 --> 12:28.790
I told you.

12:28.825 --> 12:31.275
Who was on duty when he
cut out Tavra's tongue?

12:31.310 --> 12:34.795
Me. That was the night Bianca was found.

12:34.853 --> 12:36.994
So how did he get into the cells?

12:37.080 --> 12:38.830
We've had a lot on our plates.

12:38.902 --> 12:40.573
It's not magic. You punch in a code.

12:40.608 --> 12:44.581
I know. And we just had
the whole system upgraded.

12:44.651 --> 12:46.150
Who upgraded it, Ingrid?

12:47.327 --> 12:50.630
Ketil Blakstvedt doesn't
cut people's tongues out.

12:50.665 --> 12:52.317
No. He doesn't.

12:54.745 --> 12:57.089
We should have thought of that.

12:57.199 --> 13:01.070
What about Elena? Am I the only
person that's worried about her?

13:01.105 --> 13:02.945
I'm sure she's okay, Ingrid.

13:08.110 --> 13:11.972
Oh. No. No. No. No. No...

13:27.031 --> 13:28.646
The light is gone.

13:36.157 --> 13:37.421
Erling Munk.

13:37.456 --> 13:38.476
I approached Dan Anderssen.

13:38.533 --> 13:41.002
It's obvious he's not going
to co-operate voluntarily.

13:41.052 --> 13:42.497
We'll need some help.

13:44.533 --> 13:51.028
The problem is Yelburton! She
knows. She knows everything.

13:51.083 --> 13:53.185
She knows nothing. Just do what I told you.

13:53.220 --> 13:55.900
- I'll deal with her.
- How?

13:55.965 --> 13:57.780
This is the biggest
breakthrough since antibiotics,

13:57.834 --> 14:01.044
some reindeer vet with a grudge
isn't going to blow it. Is that clear?

14:01.079 --> 14:02.770
I didn't sign up for this.

14:02.840 --> 14:04.572
You signed up for everything.

14:16.502 --> 14:17.656
Vincent!

14:19.996 --> 14:21.652
Can you gimme a hand?

14:26.056 --> 14:28.265
Have you got room in your cold storage?

14:30.211 --> 14:32.665
We found her out on the
ice, she's stone dead.

14:32.735 --> 14:34.599
Looks like she got shot.

14:34.677 --> 14:36.164
What happened to her eyes?

14:36.221 --> 14:37.933
You tell me?

14:38.096 --> 14:39.820
We've got a trolley inside.

14:39.977 --> 14:41.968
Dr. Khatri working today?

14:42.051 --> 14:43.521
She's always at work.

15:16.735 --> 15:18.780
- Hey, Doctor.
- Mr. Lennox?

15:18.874 --> 15:22.441
I was... I was wondering to know if maybe
you had, erm... a... had a chance to look

15:22.476 --> 15:25.067
at those files from Vukobejina.

15:25.815 --> 15:28.500
What's your wife's diagnosis? Can I ask?

15:29.699 --> 15:33.345
She's got Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

15:34.495 --> 15:37.432
We're years from a cure,
Mr. Lennox. I'm sorry.

15:37.489 --> 15:41.354
I know, but y... but you-you saw
that film and you saw those wasps,

15:41.417 --> 15:45.020
they changed that guy.
He grew his appendix back.

15:45.104 --> 15:47.786
On reflection, I think it's
all a little far-fetched.

15:47.821 --> 15:51.156
No, no, no, i-it's not, it's real!

15:51.243 --> 15:52.959
I went to that place.

15:53.029 --> 15:56.060
Where they operated on
that guy, in, in the film.

15:56.123 --> 15:59.700
I-It's the old weather station.
And it... I s... I saw it!

15:59.797 --> 16:04.940
The-the-the table and the
straps and it happened!

16:05.074 --> 16:06.396
I'm sure it did.

16:07.183 --> 16:12.632
You, you don't have to patronise
me... I know that you know something.

16:13.753 --> 16:15.890
You could help my wife.

16:18.134 --> 16:19.530
Please!

16:23.322 --> 16:24.505
I'm sorry.

16:26.248 --> 16:30.975
Hey. Hey. I'm not an expert on
parasites, but I play a lot of poker

16:31.010 --> 16:32.850
and I know that you're lying.

16:32.975 --> 16:34.628
Why are you lying to me?

16:36.069 --> 16:38.109
Don't you just turn your back on me.

16:39.158 --> 16:43.740
Hey! Hey!

16:43.874 --> 16:47.980
You know something. I know you do.

16:48.078 --> 16:51.524
God damn you. Why won't you help her?

16:54.238 --> 16:57.809
HEY! WHY WON'T YOU HELP HER?!

17:13.375 --> 17:15.180
What?

17:15.288 --> 17:20.361
Dad. The governor's dead.

17:21.974 --> 17:27.060
Mrs. Odegard. She's dead. I'm really sorry.

17:40.948 --> 17:42.246
Natalie Yelburton.

17:42.988 --> 17:44.035
Governor.

17:46.064 --> 17:47.704
Okay. I'll be right over.

18:38.847 --> 18:41.605
Hildur's phone is ringing.
So it's not in the water.

18:42.550 --> 18:44.970
And it was here, right? Dan pulled her out.

18:45.005 --> 18:47.770
Yeah. It was right here.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.420
Maybe we should interview Vincent.

18:51.510 --> 18:55.594
Vincent? Do you think he
knows something about this?

18:56.591 --> 18:57.663
No.

19:00.944 --> 19:02.207
But he's cute.

19:16.876 --> 19:21.909
- Michael.
- Hey, sweetheart. We just got back.

19:21.989 --> 19:23.452
Did you hear?

19:26.835 --> 19:28.722
How... how did it happen?

19:30.253 --> 19:34.778
We don't know. Dan pulled
her out of the bay last night.

19:34.812 --> 19:36.859
It seems like she just drowned.

19:36.926 --> 19:39.635
Hildur did not "just drown"!

19:39.715 --> 19:41.595
We're looking into it, okay?

19:43.051 --> 19:46.510
I need to see you. Right now.

19:56.700 --> 19:57.993
You idiot!

20:00.628 --> 20:01.879
What's that?

20:04.357 --> 20:07.270
These are mushrooms used to make muscimol.

20:07.305 --> 20:10.127
So we can guess what's in these flasks.

20:15.532 --> 20:17.322
I'll be taking care of this.

20:39.150 --> 20:44.435
Mrs. Odegard came back from Oslo
on the flight Tuesday morning.

20:44.595 --> 20:45.922
She pulled up!

20:46.758 --> 20:50.607
And I was here and I told her Tomak
was dead and she asked if she could

20:50.642 --> 20:54.722
see Eric and I said "Not a good
time" and she just went up anyway.

21:11.126 --> 21:16.651
She came in here to talk to Eric, I
listened from outside the door, but he...

21:16.795 --> 21:20.360
he cut her dead and
then someone called her.

21:20.395 --> 21:21.720
She had her phone.

21:21.755 --> 21:24.040
Yes. But not her handbag.

21:24.105 --> 21:26.068
She must have left that in the car.

21:26.148 --> 21:28.553
Do you think it was that
Mulberry bag I really liked?

21:28.588 --> 21:29.772
The dark brown one.

21:29.807 --> 21:33.000
I preferred the little black
one, the Yves Saint Laurent.

21:33.035 --> 21:35.630
- The one Eric bought her in Paris?
- Yes. For her fortieth.

21:35.665 --> 21:37.567
Ah no, she hardly ever used it.

21:38.372 --> 21:41.097
So who called her?

21:41.195 --> 21:42.520
Michael?

21:42.555 --> 21:45.669
Yes, he wanted to show
the scientists that film.

21:46.949 --> 21:52.279
I said to her, "Eric's under a lot
of strain" and she said "I know."

21:53.988 --> 21:58.889
And those were the last
words she ever said to me.

22:25.133 --> 22:28.742
Eric. I haven't been here. I just got back.

22:28.812 --> 22:31.612
I'm... I'm so sorry.

22:39.798 --> 22:47.049
Eric, I-I've been, err, hearing rumours,
people are talking about suicide...

22:47.115 --> 22:48.889
you don't believe that, do you?

22:49.940 --> 22:51.395
What do you want?

22:51.430 --> 22:55.693
Hildur, she didn't kill herself.

22:58.148 --> 23:00.092
They should have made you Sheriff!

23:06.342 --> 23:12.929
Eric. Hildur told me everything.
About Munk. About this conspiracy.

23:12.964 --> 23:18.510
Oh, no, Jesus fucking Christ... the
fucking bullshit, fucking conspiracy.

23:18.545 --> 23:21.800
- No it is not bullshit.
- Erling Munk is a fat, boring bureaucrat.

23:21.835 --> 23:24.667
He never even got a parking
fine in his whole fucking life.

23:24.733 --> 23:31.600
Goddammit, Eric, Hildur overheard
Munk talking on the phone.

23:31.635 --> 23:33.121
She needed help. She needed help!

23:33.273 --> 23:40.126
Not some sad ex-boyfriend playing
along to get back in her pants.

23:48.924 --> 23:52.606
You know what, Eric? Maybe
you should just sober up and do

23:52.672 --> 23:54.584
your fucking job.

23:58.541 --> 24:04.199
You know what, Michael? Maybe you should
have spent more time with your own wife.

24:05.117 --> 24:08.350
Maybe you wouldn't have
lost your FUCKING BOAT.

24:18.675 --> 24:19.929
Eric!

24:25.293 --> 24:26.662
Eric!

24:41.996 --> 24:45.961
Hildur didn't kill herself!
Sh-she didn't just drown!

24:48.388 --> 24:50.012
She was silenced.

24:52.675 --> 24:54.163
Silenced?

24:56.788 --> 25:00.713
Erling Munk's taking money,
and that's why he fired Hildur,

25:00.795 --> 25:03.960
and that's why he promoted Eric.

25:03.995 --> 25:06.760
And that's why she's dead.

25:06.795 --> 25:08.643
Munk killed her?

25:08.715 --> 25:13.987
Well, it's... it's not Munk,
it's somebody Munk works for.

25:14.042 --> 25:16.362
She had proof that he was corrupt.

25:16.424 --> 25:20.280
All she needed was for
Eric just to follow it up.

25:20.315 --> 25:21.929
Where's this proof?

25:24.148 --> 25:27.040
The last time I saw her, right over there,

25:27.109 --> 25:33.255
she said that she was onto
something. Something big, connected.

25:33.460 --> 25:37.745
That Munk was controlling it,
and someone was controlling Munk.

25:37.875 --> 25:41.680
A few hours later, she was dead.

25:41.715 --> 25:46.123
Munk said she was depressed. She
was drinking and saying crazy stuff.

25:46.174 --> 25:48.619
Yeah, he would say that. Wouldn't he?

25:49.445 --> 25:52.460
It doesn't make sense!
There's nothing valuable here.

25:52.495 --> 25:53.500
Nothing at all.

25:53.595 --> 25:55.333
Only rock and snow and water.

25:55.368 --> 25:57.689
Yeah, you're right...
that's what it looks like.

25:57.774 --> 26:00.174
Evidently, we're missing something.

26:06.453 --> 26:09.593
Dr. Yelburton, thank you for coming.

26:14.092 --> 26:15.901
Are you alright?

26:15.936 --> 26:21.437
- Err, Hildur was an old friend.
- Of course, sir. I'm sorry.

26:21.539 --> 26:26.264
And I'm still shocked about Dr.
Khatri, you know... what you told me.

26:26.355 --> 26:28.475
Please. Sit down.

26:34.972 --> 26:37.976
I spoke to an official
I trust at the Ministry.

26:39.148 --> 26:43.976
He is taking this very seriously, he
can go straight to the top of the W.H.O.

26:44.031 --> 26:47.149
They are the main sponsors
of Dr. Khatri's work here.

26:47.813 --> 26:51.854
But he must see all the
proof we have against her.

26:52.397 --> 26:55.387
I'm still waiting for the
results of the DNA comparison.

26:56.615 --> 27:01.054
Have you told anyone else about
your suspicions, anyone at all?

27:03.660 --> 27:05.905
Not even Vincent Rattrey?

27:05.940 --> 27:08.867
No, not even Vincent.
I haven't told a soul.

27:11.013 --> 27:14.613
I'll scan everything and get
them straight back to you.

27:58.444 --> 27:59.753
Ketil Blakstvedt.

28:00.797 --> 28:02.562
I heard you died.

28:02.636 --> 28:04.433
That's right.

28:04.508 --> 28:07.900
A while ago you changed the security
system in the police station.

28:07.986 --> 28:09.201
If you say so.

28:09.302 --> 28:12.401
- Did you do it on your own?
- I don't remember.

28:12.475 --> 28:15.264
You're not still sore about that
parking permit, are you, Ketil?

28:15.299 --> 28:18.091
Not at all, Dan.

28:18.126 --> 28:22.180
Good. Did anyone help you
with the security system?

28:22.313 --> 28:26.200
You're not even a cop
anymore, Dan Anderssen.

28:26.235 --> 28:30.520
I'm, err, doing some consultancy.

28:30.555 --> 28:33.755
I still don't remember.

28:35.403 --> 28:38.080
- Jesus, Dan. D...
- Dan.

28:38.115 --> 28:40.811
He's an outsider. Recently arrived.

28:40.875 --> 28:41.920
AH! I want a lawyer.

28:41.955 --> 28:45.120
The only lawyer in
Fortitude is Hildur Odegard.

28:45.155 --> 28:47.194
And she's currently unavailable.

28:48.463 --> 28:50.425
You're afraid of him, aren't you?

28:50.514 --> 28:52.056
He cut off the crazy guy's head!

28:52.136 --> 28:55.684
- What about Tavrani Tavra's tongue?
- Don't forget that.

28:55.771 --> 28:58.296
Vladek! Vladek Klimov!

28:58.355 --> 28:59.292
Where's he live?

28:59.327 --> 29:03.937
I don't know... he stole my fucking
generator... that's all I know.

29:03.972 --> 29:05.572
I want a list of all the
people he's worked for.

29:05.607 --> 29:07.701
- Enough.
- Because one of them's hiding him.

29:07.736 --> 29:08.732
ENOUGH!

29:12.879 --> 29:15.724
Have you no fucking respect, Dan Anderssen?

29:15.805 --> 29:17.382
This is Hildur's place!

29:17.459 --> 29:19.230
What's the matter with you?

30:08.859 --> 30:09.699
Hey.

30:12.285 --> 30:14.096
Hey. Wanna get some lunch?

30:14.152 --> 30:16.508
I'm just getting into something here.

30:16.572 --> 30:19.292
The Special at the Fox
is sheep's testicles.

30:19.350 --> 30:20.491
Oh.

30:22.366 --> 30:23.585
Erm...

30:24.623 --> 30:27.839
I wanted to tell you something.

30:28.125 --> 30:29.905
You slept with Ingrid last night.

30:32.499 --> 30:33.496
That was it.

30:34.636 --> 30:35.698
Okay.

30:38.311 --> 30:41.115
Obviously you... already knew.

30:41.195 --> 30:42.804
She's always been in love with you.

30:42.839 --> 30:44.127
Ingrid?

30:47.181 --> 30:50.935
Right, well, erm, I had no
idea how little it meant to you.

30:53.293 --> 30:58.129
- You just slept with someone else.
- You're right.

30:59.118 --> 31:00.347
I'll catch you later.

31:08.461 --> 31:11.083
Your pain will not have been for nothing.

31:11.118 --> 31:15.160
I take your pain inside me
and now I will set you free.

31:40.445 --> 31:44.116
You go. Be with everybody who loves you.

31:53.804 --> 31:57.336
They're waiting for you across the River.

32:00.004 --> 32:02.008
I'll see you again soon.

32:03.540 --> 32:05.292
In the land of the dead.

32:22.652 --> 32:24.429
So what do you think?

32:24.464 --> 32:25.981
I think it's crazy.

32:27.077 --> 32:29.928
Crazier than a mercenary
working at the Blue Fox?

32:29.963 --> 32:32.378
Or anything else that's
been going on around here?

32:36.196 --> 32:39.236
Petra. Dan gave us a job.
I think we should do it.

32:47.382 --> 32:51.532
So... Mrs. Odegard leaves Michael in
the Blue Fox, and she comes here to

32:51.567 --> 32:53.240
talk to Eric again.

32:53.327 --> 32:55.240
- She drives.
- She drives.

32:55.275 --> 32:56.517
She parks by the door.

32:56.552 --> 32:58.669
Because there's always spaces there.

32:58.704 --> 33:05.557
She fights with Eric, then she comes
back out here and she runs to the bay.

33:05.592 --> 33:07.800
Where Dan pulls her of the water.

33:07.835 --> 33:09.234
So where's her car?

33:10.728 --> 33:11.480
Hi, Dad.

33:11.515 --> 33:13.480
Have you seen your mother today?

33:13.515 --> 33:15.971
No, I left early. Why?

33:16.028 --> 33:17.753
Did you see her last night?

33:18.120 --> 33:20.483
What? Isn't she there?

33:20.588 --> 33:22.473
Where can she go? She can hardly walk now.

33:22.508 --> 33:25.209
- Her car's missing.
- She can't drive either.

33:25.302 --> 33:28.867
- That's right.
- I'm coming right over.

34:12.643 --> 34:16.129
Hello, Mr. Anderssen. This will hurt.

34:38.034 --> 34:40.342
What are you looking for?

34:40.402 --> 34:43.340
There's something going on with your
mother, something she wasn't telling me.

34:43.375 --> 34:45.166
I felt it for a while.

34:45.203 --> 34:51.150
Looking for...
prescriptions, notes, letters.

34:51.235 --> 34:53.280
Anything that doesn't belong here.

34:53.360 --> 34:56.440
- People always burn that shit.
- What?

34:56.475 --> 35:01.035
Shit people want to hide
from people. People burn it.

35:07.235 --> 35:08.447
Bed stuff.

35:10.045 --> 35:11.731
Bed stuff with blood on.

35:16.292 --> 35:20.496
Dad. Who was the contractor
for our electrical work?

35:21.315 --> 35:24.817
- Who cares about that now?
- Who did the electrical work here?

35:25.558 --> 35:27.989
Ketil Blakstvedt. Why?

35:28.275 --> 35:30.428
- Oh, God.
- What?

35:31.380 --> 35:32.789
The outhouse.

35:40.092 --> 35:41.733
I've looked here before...

35:48.156 --> 35:50.095
More blood, right?

35:51.923 --> 35:54.801
I'm so sorry. I should have said something.

35:54.874 --> 35:56.135
Said what?

35:57.355 --> 36:00.560
She lied to me. She lied to all of us.

36:00.595 --> 36:03.243
When Eric shot him, he was here.

36:03.278 --> 36:07.175
- Ingrid, who?
- The Shaman... he was working for Ketil.

36:07.828 --> 36:10.513
- Vladek?
- He's the Shaman.

36:10.595 --> 36:12.920
Vladek is the one that's
been cutting people up?

36:12.985 --> 36:14.484
Why has he taken Mum?

37:19.675 --> 37:21.871
Don't get too close.

37:21.948 --> 37:25.708
This is the body of a young woman
found out on the ice yesterday,

37:25.774 --> 37:27.884
she died within the last twenty four hours.

37:27.919 --> 37:31.947
She was wearing a Russian
Army uniform, so I assume she's

37:31.994 --> 37:33.785
from Vukobejina.

37:33.860 --> 37:36.284
Can you turn the lights
back up again please?

37:38.051 --> 37:42.324
There's a milky deposit inside her
mouth. I've taken bloods and swabs.

37:42.359 --> 37:44.394
I'd like your help me with the analysis.

37:44.870 --> 37:48.938
There are some anomalies that
are way beyond my competence.

37:48.994 --> 37:51.165
Why have you removed her eye?

37:51.268 --> 37:52.633
I haven't.

37:52.715 --> 37:54.180
She did.

37:54.252 --> 37:57.177
I found eye tissue and
blood under her finger nails.

37:57.244 --> 38:00.605
There's no doubt that she
clawed out her own eye.

38:02.228 --> 38:06.671
There are insect bites on
her neck, and hands and face,

38:06.755 --> 38:08.125
looks like black fly to me.

38:08.160 --> 38:10.382
Also present on our
polar bear and reindeer.

38:10.425 --> 38:11.910
You'd expect that, no?

38:12.446 --> 38:17.192
My point is, when they bite... black
flies, they inject this powerful

38:17.267 --> 38:22.909
anticoagulant, it's a prime vector
for parasites like river blindness.

38:22.981 --> 38:27.895
It's in the insects,
it's in the wildlife...

38:28.405 --> 38:30.222
and now it's in humans.

38:30.308 --> 38:33.372
- What is?
- I have absolutely no idea.

38:33.407 --> 38:36.630
We have to keep this
completely between ourselves.

38:37.192 --> 38:40.749
I agree. After what this
place has been through, it's...

38:49.700 --> 38:51.776
That's good work, Vince.

38:53.035 --> 38:54.280
You should go home.

38:54.456 --> 39:00.468
Listen, erm, I'm... sorry if I hurt you.

39:02.707 --> 39:04.524
Can we get a drink later?

39:05.675 --> 39:09.680
If you're up to it. You
look... a little pretty shit.

39:09.715 --> 39:11.917
Thanks. I'm fine.

39:22.580 --> 39:24.069
Where is everybody?

39:26.029 --> 39:29.859
Dan's not answering his phone. Eric's gone.

39:29.955 --> 39:32.600
Ralfi Sigurdsson said he
saw him driving off inland.

39:32.635 --> 39:35.902
When he does that, he
can disappear for weeks.

39:35.987 --> 39:38.523
- What about Ingrid?
- Family emergency.

39:41.316 --> 39:47.236
Well. I have to tell you that, err,
Dan has had some kind of episode.

39:47.308 --> 39:53.033
He's been taken in to the Research Centre
and Dr. Khatri says he could be very ill.

39:53.108 --> 39:54.881
Why not the hospital?

39:54.916 --> 39:57.807
It's far beyond the
capabilities of Dr. Adebimpe.

39:59.404 --> 40:02.458
So, what progress have you made?

40:03.755 --> 40:05.885
We can't find Hildur's car.

40:06.612 --> 40:10.817
What? Well, what about her car?

40:10.915 --> 40:15.160
I-I-I-I made it perfectly
clear we had other priorities.

40:15.195 --> 40:18.972
I've searched every street and
carpark in town. It's isn't anywhere.

40:19.007 --> 40:21.051
Hildur committed suicide.

40:21.115 --> 40:24.784
Yes. And then hid her car afterwards.

40:24.819 --> 40:27.061
Well, she could have hidden it beforehand!

40:28.541 --> 40:32.398
Yes. That's a common feature of suicides.

40:41.404 --> 40:43.529
I'm going to see Dan.

40:43.635 --> 40:48.358
Are you suggesting that, err, Hildur
is another victim of this psychopath?

40:52.084 --> 40:54.859
Yes, Governor. That's
exactly what I'm suggesting.

40:57.101 --> 40:59.801
Dan isn't allowed any vi-visitors.

41:11.667 --> 41:13.515
How did you get in here?

41:13.550 --> 41:16.313
I have to take him, now.

41:16.594 --> 41:20.439
- Step aside. Please.
- He can't be moved, he'll die.

41:20.474 --> 41:23.039
It'll take a lot more than that now.

41:23.131 --> 41:25.141
His value to science is unquantifiable.

41:25.222 --> 41:29.129
- His value to you, you mean.
- I can save him.

41:29.177 --> 41:30.247
No you can't.

41:32.484 --> 41:33.673
But I can.

41:40.966 --> 41:45.201
The canning factory,
several deserted farmhouses.

41:45.893 --> 41:49.559
- Somewhere isolated. He needs privacy.
- Yeah.

41:51.032 --> 41:52.430
The mines.

41:55.515 --> 41:56.757
Let's go.

41:56.804 --> 41:59.781
- It'll be dark soon.
- Eat a carrot.

42:00.164 --> 42:02.202
You two are staying here.

42:25.244 --> 42:26.447
Oh.

42:51.955 --> 42:53.090
Dan?

43:10.886 --> 43:12.072
Dan!

43:46.475 --> 43:47.578
Dan?

43:54.595 --> 43:55.645
Elena?

44:57.515 --> 44:59.093
- _
- AHH!

45:00.124 --> 45:01.410
It's ok. It's ok. It's ok.

45:01.445 --> 45:02.736
FREYA!

45:04.513 --> 45:05.403
DAN!
