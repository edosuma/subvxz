00:01.334 --> 00:02.703
Previously on "The Practice"...

00:02.735 --> 00:03.770
Dad.

00:03.804 --> 00:04.771
The principal says he got
a phone tip from a parent,

00:05.806 --> 00:07.107
something about you dealing.

00:07.140 --> 00:08.575
I wasn't dealing.
That's a lie.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.176
Were they your drugs?
No.

00:10.210 --> 00:11.244
Then why were they
in your locker?

00:11.277 --> 00:12.345
I don't know.
Maybe I was set up.

00:13.379 --> 00:15.749
Do you like my clock.
It has a tiny camera in it,

00:15.782 --> 00:17.818
a nanny cam.
Two nights ago

00:17.851 --> 00:19.686
I come home,
and I find this.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.388
I'm meeting him at 4:30.
He's gonna give me 8 bags.

00:22.422 --> 00:23.423
What if I get busted?

00:23.456 --> 00:25.325
My dad says
if we get caught,

00:25.358 --> 00:27.360
never admit to anything,
even to your lawyer,

00:27.393 --> 00:29.395
because they'll be stuck with
whatever you tell them.

00:29.429 --> 00:31.732
I hope you know
the bullet you dodged.

00:31.765 --> 00:32.799
You also better know,

00:32.833 --> 00:36.069
you get arrested again,
this case comes alive again.

00:37.704 --> 00:38.539
(gasps)

00:38.572 --> 00:40.774
Aah! Ooh!

00:40.807 --> 00:43.143
Neck veins are distended.
Get her into 2!

00:43.176 --> 00:44.811
Hold on, Lindsay!
Hold on!

00:44.845 --> 00:47.247
She went through
a lot of punishment.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.282
It's amazing that she
even made it here.

00:49.315 --> 00:50.684
I'm okay, Bobby.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.620
No. You were almost killed.

00:53.654 --> 00:57.323
It's gonna take a long time
before that trauma goes away.

01:00.493 --> 01:02.663
Okay, Lucy,
break out the straws.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.364
(all groaning)

01:04.397 --> 01:05.498
I don't like it, either.

01:05.532 --> 01:06.567
ELLENOR: what's the case?

01:06.600 --> 01:09.703
Some Dunsmere mental patient
petitioning for release.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.237
Rebecca --
good experience.

01:11.271 --> 01:14.107
I have moved beyond experience,
thank you very much.

01:14.140 --> 01:15.375
And I've got to
recuse myself.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.177
Some of my relations
are mental.

01:17.210 --> 01:19.112
So? We already knew that.
Oh, forget it.

01:19.145 --> 01:20.614
All right, you guys,
pick 'em.

01:27.453 --> 01:28.321
(phone rings)

01:28.354 --> 01:29.189
Oh, damn it!

01:29.222 --> 01:29.890
Oh, look, mine's long.

01:31.424 --> 01:32.759
Why do I always
get the wackos?

01:32.793 --> 01:34.294
You don't get them,
I get them.

01:34.327 --> 01:35.395
No, you date them.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.731
That's amusing.
Yeah, hold on.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.499
Eugene...

01:39.533 --> 01:40.734
it's your ex-wife.

01:47.874 --> 01:48.875
Hello?

02:09.362 --> 02:10.196
Eugene.

02:10.229 --> 02:11.732
Are they questioning her?
Take it easy.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.366
Are they
asking her questions?

02:15.769 --> 02:18.304
Eugene. Eugene.

02:21.474 --> 02:22.142
Where's Kendall?

02:22.175 --> 02:24.244
He's in his bedroom.
He's okay.

02:24.277 --> 02:26.179
Ellenor...
I'm going.

02:26.212 --> 02:27.413
I came out of the shower.

02:27.447 --> 02:30.250
I just -- I just came out
of the shower.

02:30.551 --> 02:31.718
Okay, baby. Okay.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.592
I'm gonna go check
on Kendall.

02:38.625 --> 02:39.459
Can you wait right here?

02:39.492 --> 02:41.762
Yeah.
Come back, okay?

02:41.795 --> 02:43.329
I will.
Come back.

02:43.363 --> 02:44.230
You wait right here.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.205
Little man.

02:52.238 --> 02:53.807
Dad.

02:55.275 --> 02:55.909
You okay?

02:55.942 --> 02:57.644
I'm okay.
Is mom okay?

02:57.678 --> 02:59.479
She's fine.

03:00.714 --> 03:01.682
Show me.

03:01.715 --> 03:02.683
You don't need to...

03:02.716 --> 03:04.685
I said, show me.

03:16.797 --> 03:19.499
The murder weapon appears
to be a baseball bat.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.502
Your ex-wife says she got up
to take a shower.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.704
When she came out
of the bathroom,

03:23.737 --> 03:25.506
this is what she found.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.611
(music playing)

04:15.689 --> 04:18.524
I'm gonna take care
of everything.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.493
We're gonna stick
with each other,

04:20.527 --> 04:21.795
and we're gonna
get through it.

04:21.827 --> 04:22.763
Eugene.

04:29.335 --> 04:30.270
The police want
to take him down,

04:30.303 --> 04:32.038
get some statements.
I don't think it's smart.

04:32.072 --> 04:34.307
Why?
Mike's giving me
short answers.

04:34.340 --> 04:36.076
I think
they're both suspects.
What?

04:36.109 --> 04:38.311
They're not finding
any signs of forced entry.

04:38.344 --> 04:40.280
The bat, I guess,
belongs to Kendall.

04:40.814 --> 04:41.815
You gotta be kidding.

04:42.749 --> 04:44.050
I don't think
we should let them talk.

04:44.084 --> 04:46.452
In which case they'll
definitely be suspects.

04:46.486 --> 04:48.822
If they cooperate,
then that'll be that.

04:48.855 --> 04:51.625
I don't think
we should let them talk.

04:52.559 --> 04:55.596
Are they taking them
into custody?

04:55.629 --> 04:57.497
Ellenor, don't let them
say anything

04:57.531 --> 04:59.465
until you
interview them first.

04:59.499 --> 05:01.434
You want me
to come down there?

05:01.467 --> 05:03.103
Okay. Call me.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.471
I'll wait here.

05:05.506 --> 05:06.807
The guy was dead?

05:06.840 --> 05:08.074
Sharon's boyfriend.

05:08.108 --> 05:09.075
Ellenor's going
to stay with them.

05:09.109 --> 05:11.912
I may need you to go down
to the police station.

05:15.982 --> 05:16.883
Oh, my God.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.451
What?

05:18.484 --> 05:20.086
My mental patient.
He killed five people.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.622
Excuse me?

05:21.655 --> 05:23.724
20 years ago. He's been
at Dunsmere ever since.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.025
Walter Arens.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.126
Great, just what I need.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.763
What'd you say?
Walter Arens?

05:29.796 --> 05:30.964
You know him?

05:30.997 --> 05:32.899
Do I know him?

05:32.933 --> 05:34.668
Lindsay, that's the hummer.

05:35.468 --> 05:36.236
The hummer.

05:36.269 --> 05:37.571
Don't you remember?
We were probably

05:37.604 --> 05:38.639
in junior high.

05:38.672 --> 05:42.042
He didn't just kill people.
He tortured five girls,

05:42.075 --> 05:44.511
and supposedly he would hum
while he did it.

05:44.545 --> 05:46.580
I remember that guy.

05:46.613 --> 05:47.781
The hummer?

05:47.814 --> 05:50.050
You can't be
springing him.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.723
(door opens)

05:59.159 --> 06:00.927
Where's Kendall?

06:00.961 --> 06:03.163
They want to keep you two
in different rooms.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.632
Ellenor's with him.

06:06.833 --> 06:07.568
Why?

06:07.601 --> 06:09.503
Why do they
want us separated?

06:10.804 --> 06:13.106
Sharon, tell me
exactly what happened.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.810
I went into the shower.

06:16.843 --> 06:18.779
I came out,

06:18.812 --> 06:20.446
and he was...

06:21.715 --> 06:23.116
like you saw him.

06:26.953 --> 06:28.722
This man spent the night
in your bed?

06:29.890 --> 06:30.824
Yes.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.059
What's his name?

06:33.093 --> 06:34.895
Scott Turnbull.

06:36.462 --> 06:37.798
He was a boyfriend?

06:38.732 --> 06:40.033
Somebody I was dating.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.434
Somebody you were dating.

06:41.467 --> 06:42.636
Eugene, don't go there.

06:42.669 --> 06:45.171
You have a son, and this --
I said don't.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.173
Well, the police are going
to be going there, Sharon.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.675
You're a suspect.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.514
I'm a suspect?

06:55.616 --> 06:57.818
You didn't hear anybody
come into your bedroom?

07:01.655 --> 07:04.190
No. No.

07:10.764 --> 07:11.932
Okay.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.868
Let me see if I can find out
what's going on.

07:17.838 --> 07:18.705
Eugene.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.811
We overslept.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.181
I planned on
having him gone

07:28.214 --> 07:30.951
before you dropped
Kendall off.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.862
All of a sudden
I heard my mother screaming,

07:41.895 --> 07:44.598
and I went into her room
and I saw it.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.266
What about
before she was screaming?

07:46.299 --> 07:47.801
I didn't hear much.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.970
When I dropped you off,
what'd you do then?

07:50.003 --> 07:52.038
I just went to my boom,
put in a CD,

07:52.072 --> 07:54.841
and started
getting ready for school.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.577
You didn't check
on your mother?

07:56.610 --> 07:57.343
No.

07:57.377 --> 07:58.879
Call out
to tell her you were home?

07:58.912 --> 08:01.047
I figured she might
still be asleep.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.717
Did you know she was
in there with a man?

08:03.750 --> 08:05.719
I figured she might be.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.053
How'd you figure that?

08:08.021 --> 08:10.657
I knew some guy
comes over when I'm not there.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.292
Weekends when I'm with you,

08:12.325 --> 08:14.194
I come home Mondays,
and I see stuff

08:14.227 --> 08:15.195
in the refrigerator that

08:15.228 --> 08:18.732
I know
she doesn't even eat.

08:18.765 --> 08:20.867
She's cheap.

08:20.901 --> 08:21.902
Eugene!

08:21.935 --> 08:24.004
Don't you ever talk
about your mother like that.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.706
(knock on door)

08:28.241 --> 08:30.076
How we doing? Ready?

08:30.110 --> 08:34.780
No. We're not giving you
any statement.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.029
Bag on the belt.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.232
All jewelry and metal objects
in the bin.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.067
Then through there.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.786
Wait just a minute, ma'am.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.022
(sighs)

09:19.893 --> 09:21.027
Oh, give me a break.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.937
Welcome to Dunsmere.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.573
Please don't
feed the animals.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.880
Don't mind him.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.381
They all like
to flex their muscles.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.616
It's a prison thing.

09:42.649 --> 09:45.686
But this is
a psychiatric hospital.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.921
Oh, right, I forgot.

09:47.954 --> 09:49.890
Maria Hernandez,
supervising psychiatrist.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.793
Lindsay Dole.

09:52.826 --> 09:55.228
I certainly give you credit
for taking this one.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.997
Court-ordered assignment.

09:57.030 --> 10:00.767
Well, I'm going to
give you credit anyway.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.770
I was going over
Mr. Arens' file.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.106
He still on
the antipsychotic medication?
Clozapine.

10:06.139 --> 10:09.843
No recent...
history of violence?

10:09.876 --> 10:11.845
Not in the 10 years
I've been here.

10:11.878 --> 10:13.780
He's been very cooperative.

10:13.814 --> 10:17.350
He's actually
a model patient, and sweet.

10:18.819 --> 10:19.786
So, you'd support his release

10:19.820 --> 10:20.687
to a group home
in the community.

10:20.721 --> 10:23.690
I will and have
the last three petitions,

10:23.724 --> 10:28.161
but it's probably an exercise
in futility, Ms. Dole.

10:28.194 --> 10:29.362
20 years.
If this were

10:29.395 --> 10:31.131
a real prison,
he'd be up for parole by now.

10:31.164 --> 10:35.368
Yes, but let's not forget
who he is.

10:35.401 --> 10:36.970
The hummer.

10:41.975 --> 10:42.976
Ready?

10:44.110 --> 10:45.211
Let's go.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.297
Walter,
this is Lindsay Dole,

11:04.330 --> 11:05.832
your court-appointed
attorney.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.267
She'll be handling
your petition.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.369
Hello.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.204
Hi.

11:12.038 --> 11:14.240
Thank you
for taking my case.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.277
Sure.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.181
I just need to ask you
a few questions.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.749
Certainly.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.723
Uh, I understand

11:29.756 --> 11:32.192
that you've been stabbed
yourself.

11:32.225 --> 11:35.228
Is that
going to be a problem?

11:37.764 --> 11:39.165
Would you like me
to stay?

11:52.245 --> 11:53.814
Three sets of prints
on the murder weapon --

11:53.847 --> 11:55.381
the mother's, the son's,
and the father's.

11:55.415 --> 11:56.482
Eugene's.

11:56.517 --> 11:58.852
Baseball bat -- it was kept
in the front hall closet.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.453
I'm sure they all had
opportunity to pick it up.

12:00.486 --> 12:01.988
What else?

12:02.022 --> 12:03.189
Physical evidence -- none.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.391
No sign of entry,
forced or otherwise.

12:05.425 --> 12:06.126
Am I right?

12:06.159 --> 12:07.293
Coroner marks
the time of death

12:07.327 --> 12:08.261
between 6:00 and 9:00.

12:08.294 --> 12:09.863
That's consistent
with the woman's statement.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.098
I see the boy
has a drug history.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.835
He comes home,
finds his mom in bed

12:14.868 --> 12:16.870
with a man not his father,

12:16.903 --> 12:17.938
wouldn't give you
a statement.

12:17.971 --> 12:20.473
On the advice of counsel.

12:20.507 --> 12:21.975
My money,
he's the killer.

12:22.008 --> 12:23.977
Look, I know these people.
They're my friends.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.311
Which makes you biased.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.213
Don't be your little
Napoleonic self on this one.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.081
I'm calling in a favor.

12:28.114 --> 12:30.250
Put your best team
on it.
Already have.

12:30.283 --> 12:33.219
I don't want to be leaving
things to his conclusions.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.856
That's nice,
from a co-worker.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.091
This proceeding,
as I'm sure you know,

12:38.124 --> 12:39.225
will be
in front of a jury.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.562
This is good.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.229
Since no judge
wants to be the one

12:43.263 --> 12:46.099
accused of letting
the hummer back out in public.

12:49.570 --> 12:51.872
I never really hummed,
you know.

12:51.905 --> 12:54.508
That was just
silly folklore.

12:57.844 --> 12:59.279
I'll be calling
Dr. Hernandez first,

12:59.312 --> 13:01.281
and then I'll be
calling you.
Okay.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.849
This is
an open proceeding.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.285
We can expect some
family members

13:05.318 --> 13:06.987
of the victims
to show up,

13:07.020 --> 13:08.154
though they're not
allowed to testify.

13:08.188 --> 13:09.255
The only issue
that we really need --

13:09.289 --> 13:10.423
He knows, Lindsay.

13:10.456 --> 13:13.393
This is our third petition.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.428
What I don't --

13:18.198 --> 13:19.132
I'm sorry.

13:19.165 --> 13:22.002
I'm -- I guess --
I guess I'm a little jumpy.

13:22.035 --> 13:24.170
I understand.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.341
Ms. Dole...

13:33.246 --> 13:35.281
I'm really not the person

13:35.315 --> 13:38.952
who did those
horrible things.

13:44.124 --> 13:45.325
Okay.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.361
Tell me,

13:48.394 --> 13:50.063
what do you think
of that person?

13:53.366 --> 13:58.171
I'm glad he doesn't
exist anymore.

13:58.204 --> 14:00.874
Mr. Turnbull was going
through an ugly separation

14:00.907 --> 14:03.043
with a business partner,
So, they're checking --

14:03.076 --> 14:04.911
Michael Casner.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.513
He claimed
Scott stole from him.

14:06.547 --> 14:08.649
He did threaten him once
and came to his house.

14:08.682 --> 14:13.019
Have you ever seen him
near your house?

14:13.053 --> 14:14.187
No.

14:14.220 --> 14:15.622
Well, the police
are running him down,

14:15.656 --> 14:18.158
but I have to tell you,

14:18.191 --> 14:20.661
right now, the investigation
is focusing on Kendall.

14:20.694 --> 14:21.962
What?

14:22.563 --> 14:24.064
And his not making
a statement,

14:24.097 --> 14:27.333
it only fuels
the suspicion.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.102
Absolutely not.
I agree with Ellenor.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.370
If we can put this
to rest --

14:30.403 --> 14:31.071
Eugene.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.338
The fact
that he's not talking

14:32.372 --> 14:33.106
is making him a suspect.

14:33.139 --> 14:34.975
He was there,
prints on the bat --

14:35.008 --> 14:36.042
that's what's
making him a suspect.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.143
We're fueling
their suspicions.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.444
Have you even talked
to him, Eugene?

14:38.478 --> 14:39.212
What?

14:39.245 --> 14:41.281
Have you really talked
to Kendall?

14:41.314 --> 14:42.549
What the hell
do you mean by that?

14:42.583 --> 14:43.650
You know what she means.

14:43.684 --> 14:45.051
Have you really talked
to him?

14:45.085 --> 14:46.219
I don't need to talk
to my son.

14:46.252 --> 14:47.453
You sure as hell do,

14:47.487 --> 14:49.355
certainly before
we can ever,

14:49.389 --> 14:52.392
ever let him give
a statement to the police.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.928
Look, Helen tells me that
they're checking into somebody

14:54.961 --> 14:56.530
who had some bad history
with the victim,

14:56.563 --> 14:58.532
but, Eugene, come on.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.634
The chances of somebody else
going into your house,

15:00.667 --> 15:02.636
committing murder
with a baseball bat,

15:02.669 --> 15:04.505
and neither Sharon nor Kendall
hearing anything --

15:04.538 --> 15:05.972
I'm not going
to listen to this.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.608
You may not want
to hear this, Eugene,

15:07.641 --> 15:10.143
but you need to hear it.

15:10.176 --> 15:11.477
Talk to Kendall,

15:11.512 --> 15:13.947
and then we'll make
some decisions.

15:18.552 --> 15:19.485
(door slams)

15:22.188 --> 15:24.024
You want me
to jump in on this?

15:24.057 --> 15:25.025
No, I'll handle it.

15:25.058 --> 15:28.494
I think too many lawyers
will just make it worse.

15:28.529 --> 15:30.030
What do you think, Ellenor?

15:32.766 --> 15:35.201
I don't know.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.003
So, you basically
have a jury trial

15:37.037 --> 15:38.371
to determine
whether he's sane.

15:38.404 --> 15:39.606
Pretty much.

15:39.640 --> 15:42.308
Is he sane?

15:42.342 --> 15:44.344
The medical opinion
is yes.

15:44.377 --> 15:45.278
Since he's been
on the medication --

15:45.311 --> 15:47.013
Well, what's he like?

15:47.047 --> 15:52.252
He actually seems
kind of gentle.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.153
Hey, Lindsay.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.121
A Mr. and Mrs. Rapson
are here to see you.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.489
Who are they?

15:56.523 --> 15:58.124
They wouldn't tell
what it's in regard to.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.560
They just said
it was important.

16:05.031 --> 16:06.700
I'm Lindsay Dole.
Can I help you?

16:06.733 --> 16:09.369
My name is George Rapson.
This is my wife Ellen.

16:09.402 --> 16:10.637
We understand
you're representing

16:10.671 --> 16:13.607
Walter Arens
at the hearing tomorrow.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.577
My daughter was murdered
by your client.

16:16.610 --> 16:17.744
It may have been
20 years ago --

16:17.778 --> 16:19.479
I'm sorry. We really shouldn't
be having this conversation.

16:19.513 --> 16:21.447
We're not allowed to speak
at the hearing, but --

16:21.481 --> 16:23.049
Mr. Rapson,
this conversation

16:23.083 --> 16:24.350
is inappropriate.
I'm sorry.

16:24.384 --> 16:25.552
I'm afraid I'll have to
ask you to leave.

16:25.586 --> 16:26.386
How can you fight

16:26.419 --> 16:28.188
to put this monster back
on the street?

16:28.221 --> 16:31.625
Mrs. Rapson, we're all
very sorry for your loss,

16:31.658 --> 16:32.759
but as Miss Dole said,

16:32.793 --> 16:36.062
this is not
an appropriate discussion.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.300
Come on, Ellen.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.735
We wouldn't want
to be inappropriate.

16:44.605 --> 16:46.272
(door slams)

16:48.108 --> 16:49.242
JIMMY: If you ask me,
I don't blame her.

16:49.275 --> 16:50.043
I didn't ask.

16:50.076 --> 16:52.178
So, what the guy's
on medication.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.748
That just makes him
a murderer on drugs.

16:54.781 --> 16:57.083
Invent a pill that brings
those teenagers back,

16:57.117 --> 16:58.752
then we can talk
about letting him out.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.353
Hey, Jimmy?
How is it last week

17:00.386 --> 17:01.522
you developed a crush
on a client

17:01.555 --> 17:02.723
after she emptied her gun
into somebody,

17:02.756 --> 17:03.990
but for my client,
you turn into Jesse Helms?

17:04.023 --> 17:04.858
I didn't have a crush.
There were extenuating
circumstances.

17:04.891 --> 17:07.694
And there are here.
He was mentally ill.

17:07.728 --> 17:08.795
All right!

17:10.296 --> 17:12.165
Lindsay, are you sure
you're okay to do this one?

17:12.198 --> 17:13.733
Why wouldn't I be?

17:17.303 --> 17:21.174
You want to ask our son

17:21.207 --> 17:23.409
if he committed murder.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.244
I have to find out
what his answers will be

17:25.278 --> 17:27.113
to certain questions

17:27.146 --> 17:29.049
before I let him speak
with the police.

17:38.892 --> 17:41.294
What was he doing
in your bed?

17:41.327 --> 17:42.395
I said don't.

17:42.428 --> 17:44.230
School day, Sharon.
School day.

17:44.264 --> 17:45.732
I told you I overslept.

17:45.766 --> 17:47.133
I'm sure you were up
half the night.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.669
You were tired.
What do you think

17:48.702 --> 17:50.336
it's like for him to come
home and discover --

17:50.370 --> 17:52.205
Don't you start judging me!

17:52.238 --> 17:54.274
He's judging you!
He called you cheap!

17:57.578 --> 17:59.546
That's what he said, Sharon.

17:59.580 --> 18:03.316
He was angry about that --

18:04.585 --> 18:06.252
that man being there.

18:11.357 --> 18:12.759
I pray to God
that he didn't...

18:24.671 --> 18:27.641
(Sharon crying)

18:31.845 --> 18:33.747
Are you serious?

18:33.780 --> 18:35.882
Kendall,
we're your parents.

18:35.916 --> 18:38.552
The main thing here
is that we have to be

18:38.585 --> 18:39.820
totally honest
with each other.

18:39.853 --> 18:41.588
You think I did it.

18:41.622 --> 18:43.189
No, we don't.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.625
Then why are you
even asking me?

18:44.658 --> 18:45.859
Man, I don't believe this.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.227
Kendall, sit.

18:53.499 --> 18:56.903
The police are
focusing on you.

18:56.937 --> 18:59.372
And I'm going to help you,
I promise you that.

18:59.405 --> 19:00.907
But for me...

19:03.343 --> 19:06.312
you have to come clean
with me, you understand?

19:08.348 --> 19:11.685
Kendall, your father
asked you a question.

19:11.718 --> 19:12.819
Do you understand?

19:12.853 --> 19:15.455
I understand.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.657
I understand my parents

19:16.690 --> 19:21.562
are sitting here asking me
if I'm a murderer.

19:21.595 --> 19:24.931
The answer
to your question...

19:24.965 --> 19:26.867
is no.

19:42.583 --> 19:44.951
Aah! Aah!

19:44.985 --> 19:48.421
What, Lindsay? What?

19:48.454 --> 19:49.590
I had a bad dream.

19:49.623 --> 19:50.757
What is it?

19:52.025 --> 19:53.226
(sighs)

19:53.259 --> 19:54.928
A nun with a knife.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.934
Lindsay, I really think
you should get off this case.

20:00.967 --> 20:01.868
It doesn't affect --

20:01.902 --> 20:04.505
You're representing a guy
who stabbed girls.

20:04.538 --> 20:05.506
I can do the case.

20:05.539 --> 20:06.840
I can take over
or Rebecca --

20:06.873 --> 20:07.841
I can do it!

20:07.874 --> 20:10.611
No, you're determined
to do it.

20:12.779 --> 20:15.381
What are you trying
to prove?

20:15.415 --> 20:16.216
You're the one
who accused me

20:16.249 --> 20:17.984
of pretending
you didn't get stabbed.

20:18.018 --> 20:22.723
Bobby, I can do
the damn case, all right?

20:24.958 --> 20:26.960
I'm not sure you can.

20:26.993 --> 20:29.429
Why? I suddenly can't
be a lawyer anymore?

20:29.462 --> 20:30.130
Nobody's saying --

20:30.163 --> 20:31.397
Yes, that's what's
being said.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.266
Listen, why did you
take this one?

20:33.299 --> 20:34.434
I was assigned it.

20:34.467 --> 20:35.902
I think
under the circumstances,

20:35.936 --> 20:39.039
you could have declined it.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.841
I'm not going to let
those circumstances

20:40.874 --> 20:43.409
control the rest
of my life.

20:43.443 --> 20:47.447
How about just a year?

20:47.480 --> 20:48.982
I talked to Bay
this morning.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.484
I tried to get him to submit
written questions to us.

20:51.518 --> 20:54.487
He wouldn't go for it.
I didn't expect he would.

20:54.521 --> 20:56.723
So, Kendall basically
has to field all --

20:56.757 --> 20:58.559
I want to be in the room.

20:58.592 --> 20:59.593
Well, that's a given,
Eugene.

20:59.626 --> 21:00.961
We'll both be in the room.

21:00.994 --> 21:02.062
If we don't like
the way it's going,

21:02.095 --> 21:05.732
we'll cut it off
right there.

21:05.766 --> 21:08.535
There is one possible piece
of good news.

21:08.569 --> 21:09.636
They found a blond hair --

21:09.670 --> 21:10.937
a single strand
in the bedroom --

21:10.971 --> 21:11.838
and this Michael Casner,

21:11.872 --> 21:13.807
the guy who had the run-in
with the victim,

21:13.840 --> 21:14.541
he's got blond hair.

21:14.575 --> 21:16.009
So, does
Sharon's housekeeper.

21:16.042 --> 21:16.810
Yeah, but Sharon said

21:16.843 --> 21:19.646
she hadn't been there
since Monday.

21:19.680 --> 21:21.081
The hair was on the bed?

21:21.114 --> 21:23.383
Floor.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.886
So, it could have come off
Sharon's clothing

21:25.919 --> 21:28.021
or somebody she brushed up
with at work.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.390
Yeah, maybe, Eugene,
but it's something.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.592
You know,
maybe we can prove

21:31.625 --> 21:34.027
that somebody came
into that room.

21:38.498 --> 21:40.000
Mr. Arens had suffered

21:40.033 --> 21:42.769
from chronic
paranoid schizophrenia.

21:42.803 --> 21:44.437
In his case,
it was characterized

21:44.470 --> 21:46.540
by auditory hallucinations,
if you will.

21:46.573 --> 21:47.908
Auditory hallucinations?

21:47.941 --> 21:50.476
Basically,
he heard voices.

21:50.511 --> 21:51.244
And these voices,

21:51.277 --> 21:52.979
they were connected
to his crimes?

21:53.013 --> 21:55.081
Yes. He felt
he was instructed

21:55.115 --> 21:56.416
to commit the killings.

21:56.449 --> 21:57.851
Does he still hear
these voices today?

21:57.884 --> 21:58.685
No.

21:58.719 --> 22:00.921
Since going on clozapine
11 years ago,

22:00.954 --> 22:03.356
he's had no symptoms
of psychosis.

22:03.389 --> 22:04.858
The paranoid disorder?

22:04.891 --> 22:06.927
It's under control.

22:06.960 --> 22:10.063
He is now mentally healthy,
in your medical opinion.

22:10.096 --> 22:12.899
Well, I would certainly
recommend ongoing therapy.

22:12.933 --> 22:15.035
20 years
on institutional life

22:15.068 --> 22:17.003
can certainly leave
some emotional

22:17.037 --> 22:18.505
and psychological scars,

22:18.539 --> 22:19.873
but I would
most certainly

22:19.906 --> 22:21.842
recommend his release
from Dunsmere,

22:21.875 --> 22:23.043
and I have been
recommending this

22:23.076 --> 22:25.846
for three years.

22:25.879 --> 22:28.515
This man tortured
and murdered

22:28.549 --> 22:30.483
five teenage girls.

22:30.517 --> 22:31.985
While suffering
from a mental disorder

22:32.018 --> 22:33.787
he no longer suffers from.

22:33.820 --> 22:36.089
That isn't really true,
doctor, is it?

22:36.122 --> 22:38.559
If he were to go off
these pills,

22:38.592 --> 22:40.493
he could once again
fall victim

22:40.527 --> 22:42.596
to this paranoid schizophrenia,
isn't that true?

22:42.629 --> 22:44.064
It's possible.

22:44.097 --> 22:46.867
He could become psychotic
all over again.

22:46.900 --> 22:48.669
Also, possible.

22:48.702 --> 22:50.070
Possible?

22:51.772 --> 22:54.808
Well, if Mr. Arens
were to tell you

22:54.841 --> 22:57.010
he was going to stop
taking his medication,

22:57.043 --> 22:58.679
would you recommend
his release?

22:58.712 --> 22:59.412
No.

22:59.445 --> 23:01.815
So, we would
have to trust him

23:01.848 --> 23:03.016
to take his pills,
wouldn't we?

23:03.049 --> 23:04.851
Yes.

23:04.885 --> 23:07.087
And you can't guarantee us
that we wouldn't forget --

23:07.120 --> 23:08.188
I don't think
he's forgotten --

23:08.221 --> 23:10.490
you can't guarantee he won't
forget to take his pills,

23:10.524 --> 23:12.092
in my opinion --
can you, doctor?

23:12.125 --> 23:14.127
Can you guarantee
this court

23:14.160 --> 23:16.597
that he will not forget
to take his pills?

23:16.630 --> 23:17.631
Of course not.

23:17.664 --> 23:19.900
And you can't guarantee us

23:19.933 --> 23:22.435
that he might not
simply choose one day

23:22.468 --> 23:24.871
to stop taking
his medication.

23:24.905 --> 23:25.839
No.

23:25.872 --> 23:28.809
And since the failure
to take this medication

23:28.842 --> 23:31.477
could cause
the psychosis to return,

23:31.512 --> 23:32.746
you cannot sit
in that chair

23:32.779 --> 23:35.081
and guarantee us that
he will not kill again,

23:35.115 --> 23:37.150
can you, doctor?

23:37.183 --> 23:38.184
I cannot guarantee

23:38.218 --> 23:40.120
you won't kill anybody,
either.

23:40.153 --> 23:42.488
Except I'm not psychotic.

23:44.625 --> 23:45.726
He is.

23:49.563 --> 23:50.797
Now, you said a minute ago

23:50.831 --> 23:53.466
you suspected she was
in her room with a man.

23:53.499 --> 23:55.636
I heard talking, yeah.
That's kind of why

23:55.669 --> 23:57.804
I went upstairs
to put music on.

23:57.838 --> 23:58.672
I didn't want
to hear anything.

23:58.705 --> 24:00.941
And when you heard
your mother screaming?

24:00.974 --> 24:03.176
I went downstairs,
I came to her room,

24:03.209 --> 24:05.512
and there was
a dead guy on her bed.

24:05.546 --> 24:07.614
Did you see anybody else
in the house?

24:07.648 --> 24:11.585
No, I told you, there was
nobody else around at all.

24:12.919 --> 24:13.854
Okay.

24:15.856 --> 24:17.624
Now, when your father
dropped you off,

24:17.658 --> 24:19.626
you said he stayed
in the car.

24:19.660 --> 24:21.027
Yeah.

24:21.061 --> 24:23.063
Did you actually
see him drive off?

24:23.096 --> 24:25.899
I don't know.
He usually waits for me.

24:25.932 --> 24:27.634
But after you got
inside the door,

24:27.668 --> 24:29.169
he would've then left.

24:29.202 --> 24:30.470
Yeah.

24:34.641 --> 24:36.710
How did it make you feel,
Kendall,

24:36.743 --> 24:38.645
knowing that your mother
was in her room

24:38.679 --> 24:40.113
with another man?

24:41.548 --> 24:42.182
I didn't like it.

24:42.215 --> 24:43.850
Did it make you angry?

24:43.884 --> 24:45.051
All right,
I don't think this --

24:45.085 --> 24:46.152
Excuse me?

24:46.186 --> 24:47.654
We're here
to collect information.

24:47.688 --> 24:49.189
We're here so, I can
ask him some questions.

24:49.222 --> 24:50.991
Okay, look, I think we need
to set some ground rules.

24:51.024 --> 24:53.093
What ground rules?
This is a homicide.

24:53.126 --> 24:55.195
We don't set ground rules
for interviews with suspects.

24:55.228 --> 24:55.929
This is over.

24:55.962 --> 24:56.863
Then I'll just
have him arrested.

24:56.897 --> 24:59.132
Let's get the lawyers in
a room for a second.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.734
If I'm a room with him,
he might get hurt.

25:00.767 --> 25:02.969
Quiet! We're all going
to take a minute,

25:03.003 --> 25:04.237
then the lawyers
will meet.

25:04.270 --> 25:05.739
I'm not meeting
anywhere with him.

25:05.772 --> 25:08.174
Eugene, we don't owe you this.
Let's just do it.

25:10.944 --> 25:13.013
Mr. Arens, you've been
listening to the doctors

25:13.046 --> 25:14.815
discuss
your current condition.

25:14.848 --> 25:17.217
What do you think?
Are you mentally ill?

25:17.250 --> 25:20.186
Yes, I am.

25:20.220 --> 25:22.288
Do you suffer from
the same disease today

25:22.322 --> 25:23.924
that you did in 1979?

25:23.957 --> 25:28.995
Yes, but I'm not sick,
not anymore.

25:29.029 --> 25:31.698
I used to have
hallucinations.

25:31.732 --> 25:35.569
I was afraid that people
who tried to help me

25:35.602 --> 25:39.039
or be nice to me were
really out to hurt me --

25:39.072 --> 25:40.707
women, mostly --

25:40.741 --> 25:42.776
and that I had
to hurt them first.

25:42.809 --> 25:44.110
Is that what happened
to those girls?

25:44.144 --> 25:49.613
Yes. There was so much
noise in my head then.

25:50.817 --> 25:52.953
I couldn't think clearly,

25:52.986 --> 25:55.789
but I can now.

25:55.822 --> 25:57.991
I know that what I did
was horrible

25:58.024 --> 26:02.028
and unforgivable.

26:02.763 --> 26:05.231
I know that,
and I don't ever

26:05.265 --> 26:07.033
want to be ill
like that again.

26:07.067 --> 26:09.135
But why should this jury have
any sympathy for you at all?

26:09.169 --> 26:11.171
They shouldn't.

26:11.204 --> 26:14.040
I don't deserve sympathy.

26:14.074 --> 26:15.742
I'm not the victim.

26:17.210 --> 26:21.782
Those people --
they're victims.

26:21.815 --> 26:23.650
I murdered their daughter,

26:25.085 --> 26:30.624
but I did so when suffering
from a condition.

26:30.657 --> 26:34.394
Mr. Arens, tell us
about this condition

26:34.427 --> 26:37.030
from your perspective.

26:37.063 --> 26:38.899
Well, as the doctors
explain it,

26:38.932 --> 26:41.267
there is a part of my brain
called the amygdala

26:41.301 --> 26:43.704
that was overstimulated
with brain chemicals,

26:43.737 --> 26:47.741
making me hear and see
things that didn't exist.

26:47.774 --> 26:48.942
Objection -- foundation.

26:48.975 --> 26:50.310
He's giving
a medical opinion.

26:50.343 --> 26:52.045
Sustained.

26:52.078 --> 26:54.915
Just tell us
what you felt, Mr. Arens,

26:54.948 --> 26:56.883
in your words.

26:56.917 --> 27:00.386
I would get
these impulses,

27:00.420 --> 27:05.413
these overriding urges
to -- to hurt people.

27:06.893 --> 27:08.094
I can't explain it
any better than that.

27:08.128 --> 27:08.962
I wish I could.

27:08.995 --> 27:12.933
All I can say --
I couldn't control them,

27:12.966 --> 27:16.402
but with the medication,
I can,

27:16.436 --> 27:17.671
and I have.

27:21.241 --> 27:22.442
You say you want him
to cooperate,

27:22.475 --> 27:24.077
then you ask him
questions designed

27:24.110 --> 27:25.278
to illicit
incriminating responses.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.147
Don't give me that.
That's not what I'm doing.

27:27.180 --> 27:28.281
Hey, look, we don't have
to continue this.

27:28.314 --> 27:29.850
Richard.
In which case --

27:29.883 --> 27:31.985
in which case, nothing.
Go ahead and arrest him.

27:32.018 --> 27:33.386
That will only guarantee
his silence.

27:33.419 --> 27:36.690
Look, here's the problem here.
You need to make an arrest.

27:36.723 --> 27:38.191
You need
to get a conviction.

27:38.224 --> 27:39.893
Going after Kendall
is the easiest way

27:39.926 --> 27:43.129
to accomplish that, so, that's
how he becomes the focus.

27:43.163 --> 27:43.930
Is that right?

27:43.964 --> 27:45.198
Damn right.
Pick the easy target --

27:45.231 --> 27:46.700
it was his bat,
he was there.

27:46.733 --> 27:47.734
How dare you.

27:47.768 --> 27:48.602
I know you.

27:48.635 --> 27:50.103
If I were picking
easy targets, Eugene,

27:50.136 --> 27:52.238
What?
I'd have gone after you.

27:52.272 --> 27:53.439
Come on.

27:53.473 --> 27:56.276
Your prints were on that bat.
You were there, too. Come on.

27:56.309 --> 27:59.012
Jealous husband, ex-wife's
in bed with another man.

27:59.045 --> 28:00.781
Hey, let's not forget
about the temper.

28:00.814 --> 28:02.716
You've beaten up your own
clients. You just threatened

28:02.749 --> 28:04.918
Richard!
To hurt me
three minutes ago.

28:04.951 --> 28:06.019
You talk about
easy targets.

28:06.052 --> 28:07.387
I could try this thing
in Dedham,

28:07.420 --> 28:09.389
put the big, black,
jealous husband on trial,

28:09.422 --> 28:11.391
and I'd probably
get my conviction.

28:11.424 --> 28:15.161
Don't be accusing me of going
after easy targets, Eugene.

28:15.195 --> 28:18.331
You'd be it --
opportunity, motive, black,

28:18.364 --> 28:20.133
prints on the weapon.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.736
You'd be it,
and I'd get you!

28:22.769 --> 28:24.771
I'd get you.

28:25.972 --> 28:28.274
Then come and get me.

28:28.308 --> 28:30.010
But leave my boy
out of it.

28:40.320 --> 28:43.824
Mr. Arens, you once said
to a fellow patient,

28:43.857 --> 28:46.326
"I hope they never
let me out

28:46.359 --> 28:48.128
because I'll probably
kill again."

28:48.161 --> 28:51.264
That was before I started
with the medication.

28:51.297 --> 28:52.398
Before you murdered
Laurie Rapson,

28:52.432 --> 28:54.067
you first cut off
both her hands.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.402
Objection -- my client
pled insanity and was found

28:56.436 --> 28:57.871
to be insane at the time
of the attack.

28:57.904 --> 28:58.939
Move to strike that.
I object to him introducing

28:58.972 --> 28:59.806
She can give her conclusion
this evidence as hearsay

28:59.840 --> 29:01.074
during final arguments.
for the purpose

29:01.107 --> 29:03.276
This is a cross-examination.
of inflaming the jury,
your honor.

29:03.309 --> 29:05.411
All right, quiet!

29:05.445 --> 29:08.381
Mr. Bullock, the purpose
of this hearing is to determine

29:08.414 --> 29:09.950
the defendant's
current mental state.

29:09.983 --> 29:11.351
And actions speak
to that, your honor,

29:11.384 --> 29:12.352
even if they're past acts.

29:12.385 --> 29:14.354
You're talking
about 20 years ago.

29:14.387 --> 29:16.923
Ms. Dole, your objection
is sustained.

29:16.957 --> 29:18.424
Mr. Bullock,
do not revisit

29:18.458 --> 29:20.393
the horrors
of Mr. Arens' crimes.

29:22.529 --> 29:24.464
Mr. Arens,

29:24.497 --> 29:27.133
do these pills you take --
your medication --

29:27.167 --> 29:29.870
do they affect
your conscience?

29:32.338 --> 29:33.473
My conscience?

29:33.507 --> 29:34.941
Yes.

29:34.975 --> 29:36.543
Does this clozapine
affect it?

29:39.245 --> 29:42.015
I can't say that it does.
I don't think it would.

29:42.048 --> 29:44.150
And this psychosis
that you had --

29:44.184 --> 29:45.251
was this
a permanent thing,

29:45.285 --> 29:47.153
or would it hit you
in stages?

29:47.187 --> 29:51.191
The latter. Most of the time,
I was fine,

29:51.224 --> 29:55.562
and then, suddenly, I would
get the paranoid impulses.

29:55.596 --> 29:58.131
So, in between
these killings,

29:58.164 --> 30:00.300
you would go back
to your normal self --

30:00.333 --> 30:03.269
the self that you resemble
today, is that right?

30:03.303 --> 30:06.840
I don't know.
I guess so.

30:06.873 --> 30:08.108
Well, then, why,

30:09.375 --> 30:12.112
during these periods
of normalcy,

30:12.145 --> 30:14.848
after you had killed
somebody, cut off hands,

30:14.881 --> 30:16.382
committed torture,

30:16.416 --> 30:19.352
why didn't you turn
yourself in to the police

30:19.385 --> 30:21.522
before the next bout
of paranoia hit you?

30:21.555 --> 30:22.388
He's asking
medical questions.

30:22.422 --> 30:23.590
I am not.

30:24.490 --> 30:25.926
I'll allow it.

30:25.959 --> 30:28.328
You said yourself
that these pills

30:28.361 --> 30:30.330
probably don't affect
conscience.

30:30.363 --> 30:33.366
We're dealing
with the same conscience now

30:33.399 --> 30:34.568
as we were then,

30:34.601 --> 30:39.205
and then, in between
these stages of psychosis,

30:39.239 --> 30:42.408
you didn't turn
yourself in, Mr. Arens,

30:42.442 --> 30:47.447
knowing there might be
another victim.

30:55.556 --> 30:56.456
It was racist.

30:56.489 --> 30:59.059
It was not racist.
I was just telling him --

30:59.092 --> 31:00.927
You're talking about going
after him because he's

31:00.961 --> 31:02.162
a big black man.
That isn't racist?

31:02.195 --> 31:04.330
Come on!
I was speaking
statistically.

31:04.364 --> 31:06.533
He accused me of going
after the easy targets.

31:06.567 --> 31:08.034
I was telling him,
statistically,

31:08.068 --> 31:09.335
he would be
the easiest target.

31:09.369 --> 31:10.671
Yes, because
he's big and black.

31:10.704 --> 31:13.907
Yes, but that makes me
pragmatic, Helen, not a racist.

31:13.940 --> 31:16.009
Well, then you're a dangerous,
twisted pragmatist.

31:16.042 --> 31:18.244
By the way, are you sure
he didn't do it?

31:18.278 --> 31:21.147
I mean, did you even take
one half of one-half of a second

31:21.181 --> 31:22.182
No.
To ask yourself --

31:22.215 --> 31:24.518
Why? Because
he's your friend,

31:24.551 --> 31:27.053
or because you're just afraid
of being called a racist?

31:27.654 --> 31:29.055
If you weren't so little,

31:29.089 --> 31:30.591
I'd beat the crap
out of you right now.

31:31.224 --> 31:32.058
Get out.

31:32.092 --> 31:33.627
It's my office.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.367
Son of a bitch!

31:41.401 --> 31:42.936
Sorry.

31:42.969 --> 31:45.438
We just got preliminary results
back from the lab.

31:45.471 --> 31:47.407
We're ready
to make an arrest.

31:52.412 --> 31:57.083
A few months ago,
I was stabbed.

31:57.117 --> 31:59.452
I almost died,
and for a while,

31:59.485 --> 32:02.255
the person who did it
was out there at large,

32:02.288 --> 32:04.958
and I can't even begin
to tell you the --

32:07.293 --> 32:11.464
I-I can't begin to tell you.

32:11.497 --> 32:15.268
The man who stabbed me --
he's dead now,

32:15.301 --> 32:17.403
and I'm glad.

32:17.437 --> 32:21.274
Those people -- perhaps
they wish for my client's death.

32:21.307 --> 32:22.676
It's natural.

32:22.709 --> 32:24.745
But today's trial --
it's not about vengeance,

32:24.778 --> 32:27.280
and it's not about
retributions,

32:27.313 --> 32:30.016
and it's not about
forgiveness, either.

32:30.050 --> 32:35.155
Like every trial,
it's about the rule of law.

32:35.188 --> 32:38.024
Walter Arens was found
not guilty

32:38.058 --> 32:39.159
by reason of insanity

32:39.192 --> 32:40.627
and, accordingly,
institutionalized

32:40.661 --> 32:42.563
for the duration
of his mental illness.

32:42.596 --> 32:45.165
The uncontroverted
medical opinion before you today

32:45.198 --> 32:47.367
is that the insanity is over.

32:47.400 --> 32:51.237
Through medication,
Mr. Arens is well again,

32:51.271 --> 32:55.275
and under the rule of law,
that means he must be released.

32:55.308 --> 32:56.442
You don't have to like that.

32:56.476 --> 32:58.645
You don't have to agree
with the law,

32:58.679 --> 32:59.846
but you did assume
an obligation

32:59.880 --> 33:03.449
when you were sworn in as jurors
that you would uphold it.

33:03.483 --> 33:06.019
He is not cured.

33:06.052 --> 33:10.290
He is just not symptomatic
as long as he takes his pills,

33:10.323 --> 33:12.458
just like an alcoholic
isn't drunk,

33:12.492 --> 33:14.394
so long as
he doesn't drink.

33:14.427 --> 33:15.662
But who's to say?

33:15.696 --> 33:18.431
What if he falls
off that wagon?

33:18.464 --> 33:20.734
What if he doesn't
take his pills?

33:20.767 --> 33:23.537
Or what if, after years
and years of use,

33:23.570 --> 33:25.806
he builds up an immunity
to the medication,

33:25.839 --> 33:28.241
and it is no longer effective?

33:28.274 --> 33:31.545
There are questions here,

33:31.578 --> 33:34.080
and in answering them,

33:34.114 --> 33:38.552
who do you give the benefit
of the doubt to --

33:38.585 --> 33:42.623
him, the man who gutted
five teenage girls?

33:42.656 --> 33:45.592
Oh, yes, in the controlled
environment of Dunsmere,

33:45.626 --> 33:50.263
he is behaved, gentle, civil.

33:50.296 --> 33:53.199
Does that guarantee us

33:53.233 --> 33:58.739
that when we put him back
out there with changed stimuli,

33:58.772 --> 34:02.108
with the pressures of having
to work for a living,

34:02.142 --> 34:07.548
does any of us really know
what will happen?

34:08.481 --> 34:11.518
Oh, yes, let's trade
on fear. Let's be safe.

34:11.552 --> 34:13.386
Let's give the benefit
of the doubt to the people.

34:13.418 --> 34:16.255
That makes sense, doesn't it?
But following that,

34:16.289 --> 34:18.792
we shouldn't let epileptics
drive cars, should we?

34:18.824 --> 34:21.327
So what, medication
can control seizures?

34:21.360 --> 34:24.130
Let's play it safe.
Better safe than sorry.

34:24.164 --> 34:25.331
While we're at it,
why don't we round up

34:25.364 --> 34:28.101
all of the HIV-positive kids
and get them out of the schools?

34:29.536 --> 34:30.737
Once we start going down

34:30.771 --> 34:33.106
the "better safe
than sorry" road --

34:35.609 --> 34:37.310
but that's not the issue,

34:37.911 --> 34:40.581
and you are not congressmen
deciding what should be the law.

34:40.614 --> 34:43.416
You are jurors obligated
to uphold it,

34:43.784 --> 34:46.753
and the law once again says

34:46.786 --> 34:50.891
if he is now sane,
he should be released.

34:50.924 --> 34:55.428
And I maintain
anybody who can torture,

34:55.460 --> 34:59.399
who murders --
he's not sane.

34:59.432 --> 35:01.301
Whatever thing inside him

35:01.334 --> 35:02.736
that made him do
those things --

35:02.769 --> 35:04.237
it's still in there,

35:04.270 --> 35:08.141
however controlled
it's been by drugs.

35:08.174 --> 35:11.344
We are talking about
a depraved killer,

35:11.812 --> 35:14.180
and when you go back
into that room,

35:14.681 --> 35:17.383
you had better ask yourselves,

35:19.185 --> 35:21.555
how are you going to feel
if he kills again?

35:32.365 --> 35:33.600
Where's Kendall?

35:33.634 --> 35:35.536
In my office
with Sharon. What?

35:35.569 --> 35:36.436
The blond hair --

35:36.469 --> 35:38.572
DNA drew a consistent match
with the guy.

35:38.605 --> 35:39.840
What guy?

35:39.873 --> 35:40.907
Casner, the one
who's been having the beef

35:40.941 --> 35:42.843
with Turnbull, the victim.

35:42.876 --> 35:46.747
He was in the bedroom, Eugene.
Casner went into that bedroom.

35:46.780 --> 35:48.414
Wait a minute.
If he was in the bedroom --

35:48.448 --> 35:49.750
they also found splatterings
of Turnbull's blood

35:49.783 --> 35:52.619
in Casner's car. The police
just arrested him.

35:52.653 --> 35:54.420
He went in while Sharon
was in the shower?

35:54.454 --> 35:56.356
That's what they think.
He went into the front door,

35:56.389 --> 35:57.090
he saw the bat,
he grabbed it,

35:57.123 --> 35:59.425
and he went
right into the room.

36:03.329 --> 36:05.832
It was Casner.
It was his hair in the bedroom,

36:05.866 --> 36:08.969
they found blood in his car,
the police just arrested him,

36:09.002 --> 36:09.836
and it's over.

36:09.870 --> 36:10.737
My God.

36:10.771 --> 36:11.905
It's over.

36:14.274 --> 36:16.977
I told you. I told you.

36:17.010 --> 36:18.311
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did.

36:18.344 --> 36:19.746
EUGENE: It's over.

36:19.780 --> 36:23.884
I told you, I told you,
I told you.

36:39.933 --> 36:43.537
Already? They weren't out
five minutes.

36:43.570 --> 36:45.906
3 minutes and 55 seconds.

36:48.575 --> 36:51.344
Can you even call that
a deliberation?

36:51.377 --> 36:53.246
Well...

36:54.447 --> 36:56.282
I'm sorry.

36:56.750 --> 36:59.252
Hey, maybe
they'll surprise us.

36:59.285 --> 37:00.521
(sighs)

37:01.588 --> 37:02.723
Yeah.

37:16.436 --> 37:18.872
Members of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

37:18.905 --> 37:19.973
Yes, your honor.

37:20.006 --> 37:21.842
How say you?

37:21.875 --> 37:24.845
In re Arens, we the jury

37:24.878 --> 37:27.447
find in favor
of the petitioner.

37:27.480 --> 37:29.550
(gallery reacts)

37:29.583 --> 37:31.918
MAN: Get that story out.

37:31.952 --> 37:34.420
Get that story.

37:37.323 --> 37:39.459
We won.
You'll be released.

37:42.462 --> 37:43.730
You're going to be free.

38:04.484 --> 38:05.719
How you doing?

38:06.620 --> 38:08.454
I'm okay.

38:10.991 --> 38:11.692
Where's Kendall?

38:11.725 --> 38:15.461
He's upstairs.
I think he's okay.

38:18.498 --> 38:19.800
I thought maybe you guys

38:19.833 --> 38:22.335
ought to get out of the house
for a few days,

38:22.368 --> 38:25.572
stay with me or friends,
whatever.

38:25.606 --> 38:27.608
I think we're okay here.

38:29.109 --> 38:30.844
Okay.

38:32.813 --> 38:34.414
Thank you.

38:36.149 --> 38:37.584
We never would have
gotten through this

38:37.618 --> 38:39.019
without...

38:39.520 --> 38:42.556
Yeah, so...

38:43.890 --> 38:45.491
call me if you need
anything, okay?

38:45.526 --> 38:47.127
I will. I will.

38:47.160 --> 38:48.361
Okay.

38:56.970 --> 38:58.539
You okay?

39:00.140 --> 39:01.542
No.

39:04.678 --> 39:07.648
I had to look my son
in the eye and ask him if...

39:10.717 --> 39:14.755
Sharon, I couldn't know
he didn't do it.

39:14.788 --> 39:18.559
I-I'm just not
as connected to him

39:18.592 --> 39:20.627
as much as I used to be.

39:22.596 --> 39:23.964
Eugene...

39:23.997 --> 39:26.733
we both had to ask,

39:27.433 --> 39:29.069
not because
we doubted him so much

39:29.102 --> 39:32.573
as the circumstances.

39:33.640 --> 39:36.677
We both had to
at least ask.

39:38.879 --> 39:41.414
I just wish I were
here more for him.

39:48.689 --> 39:50.524
I do, too.

40:40.674 --> 40:42.909
So, he's on the street.
Free to hum again.

40:42.943 --> 40:45.746
He gets transferred
to a non-secure facility.

40:45.779 --> 40:48.014
Non-secure --
that means he's free.

40:48.048 --> 40:49.115
Hey, don't attack me.

40:49.149 --> 40:50.483
Why not?
You put him out there.

40:50.517 --> 40:52.485
Are you serious?
Rebecca.

40:52.519 --> 40:55.722
If somebody brutally kills,
they should go to prison.

40:55.756 --> 40:57.057
If they're nuts,
they go to a mental prison.

40:57.090 --> 40:59.492
Either way,
they should stay there.

41:00.293 --> 41:01.895
You should be a D. A.

41:01.928 --> 41:03.530
Don't think I haven't
thought of that.

41:03.564 --> 41:07.568
Why do I get all the terrible
phone calls? Lindsay.

41:08.969 --> 41:09.970
Hello?

41:18.812 --> 41:20.581
OFFICER: He's over there.

41:20.614 --> 41:21.648
What happened?

41:21.682 --> 41:25.151
Held up a gas station
attendant -- knife point.

41:33.560 --> 41:34.528
Walter?

41:34.561 --> 41:36.129
I want to go back.

41:36.162 --> 41:37.297
What do you mean,
you want to go back?

41:37.330 --> 41:39.065
The things
the D. A. Said --

41:39.099 --> 41:40.901
they just keep
ringing in my head.

41:40.934 --> 41:42.102
You mean, like voices?

41:42.135 --> 41:45.706
No, not voices, Lindsay --
the things he said.

41:45.739 --> 41:48.274
What if changed circumstances
do make a difference?

41:49.009 --> 41:51.578
What if I build up
an immunity to clozapine?

41:51.612 --> 41:54.748
What if -- God forbid, what if
a pharmacist should screw up

41:54.781 --> 41:56.917
and not give me the right
medication or dosage...

41:56.950 --> 41:57.684
Walter --

41:57.718 --> 41:59.886
what he said about
my conscience --

42:00.220 --> 42:01.655
why didn't I turn myself in

42:01.688 --> 42:03.323
in between my bouts
of paranoia?

42:03.356 --> 42:04.791
I don't want to be out
on the street

42:04.825 --> 42:05.859
like some loose cannon.

42:05.892 --> 42:06.827
Okay, slow down.

42:06.860 --> 42:09.162
They won't take me back
unless I do something.

42:09.195 --> 42:10.897
Now I have.

42:12.633 --> 42:13.900
Did you commit
this crime

42:13.934 --> 42:15.836
so that you'd be
returned to Dunsmere?

42:16.970 --> 42:20.774
What if the chemicals change
in my brain again, Lindsay?

42:20.807 --> 42:22.976
I shouldn't be out here.

42:25.111 --> 42:30.261
Walter, one of the reasons
I took this case --

42:31.985 --> 42:33.587
I wanted to prove
to myself

42:33.620 --> 42:38.091
that I was stronger
than my fear.

42:41.995 --> 42:44.665
Now, you have
to prove it to yourself.

42:46.667 --> 42:49.202
I murdered five people.

42:50.003 --> 42:51.905
Send me back.

43:31.411 --> 43:34.681
(music playing)

43:57.704 --> 43:58.805
You stinker!
