09:59.240 --> 10:00.350
Hank...

10:00.550 --> 10:01.850
we all have
a right to know.

10:02.050 --> 10:03.680
Can you not be yourself

10:03.880 --> 10:04.820
and be straight with us
for one minute?

10:05.020 --> 10:05.950
[Emma]
My friend in sociology

10:06.150 --> 10:06.890
heard there were
going to be cuts.

10:07.090 --> 10:09.020
My friend in history
said the same.

10:09.220 --> 10:10.560
It's possible they heard it
from each other,

10:10.760 --> 10:12.830
but also possible
it was two independent sources.

10:13.030 --> 10:14.690
If history is to repeat itself,

10:14.890 --> 10:16.190
which it is wont to do,

10:16.390 --> 10:17.530
bore that it is,

10:17.730 --> 10:20.700
then we are waltzing a waltz
that we have waltzed before.

10:20.900 --> 10:22.700
We need not fear a misstep
or a st--

10:22.900 --> 10:23.700
[Emma] Finny!

10:23.900 --> 10:25.070
[Gracie] We've earned
the truth, Hank.

10:25.270 --> 10:26.720
We demand the truth.

10:32.860 --> 10:33.710
It's all true.

10:33.910 --> 10:35.500
I'm gonna go make
a list now, okay?

10:39.130 --> 10:40.890
They wanted me to lie to you,

10:41.090 --> 10:42.890
to tell you it wasn't happening.

10:43.090 --> 10:44.390
They were concerned
that you might panic,

10:44.590 --> 10:45.990
but I said no.

10:46.190 --> 10:48.340
No, they're all adults.

10:51.380 --> 10:52.680
[door closes]

11:03.560 --> 11:06.700
[**]

11:08.830 --> 11:10.580
Still waiting
for my recommendation.

11:10.780 --> 11:11.770
What's going on?

11:15.500 --> 11:16.720
Don't become a professor.

11:16.920 --> 11:17.760
Just stay an adjunct.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.540
There's more freedom that way.

11:22.010 --> 11:23.460
If you get this job,

11:23.660 --> 11:26.360
you will throw yourself
into your teaching,

11:26.560 --> 11:27.470
but it won't be long

11:27.670 --> 11:30.100
before you realize
you can't help these kids.

11:30.300 --> 11:32.470
There's more promise
in a senior-citizen yoga class.

11:32.670 --> 11:33.870
They're not that bad.

11:34.070 --> 11:34.940
Yeah, so fine,

11:35.140 --> 11:36.110
you will throw yourself
into your writing,

11:36.310 --> 11:38.110
but guess what?

11:38.310 --> 11:41.050
Selling 460 copies
of your novel

11:41.250 --> 11:43.080
about being a professor
in a small town,

11:43.280 --> 11:44.620
that's not as exciting
to your publisher

11:44.820 --> 11:45.650
as you imagine.

11:45.850 --> 11:46.620
So, finally, you decide,

11:46.820 --> 11:47.820
you know what,

11:48.020 --> 11:49.320
I'll just use my chairmanship

11:49.520 --> 11:53.060
to torment my arrogant, petty,
self-obsessed colleagues.

11:53.260 --> 11:54.290
Hey, lay off my mom.

11:54.490 --> 11:56.960
But it's not too long
before even that holds no joy.

11:57.160 --> 11:59.800
You will be trapped by tenure
in this town,

12:00.000 --> 12:00.630
and you will regret it.

12:00.830 --> 12:02.630
Hank, slide over.

12:02.840 --> 12:03.570
No, sit there.

12:03.770 --> 12:05.590
I'm getting close for effect.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.840
You know how good
a teacher I am.

12:10.040 --> 12:10.810
Just because

12:11.010 --> 12:12.140
I haven't published
that first book yet,

12:12.340 --> 12:13.310
I'm invisible

12:13.510 --> 12:14.310
unless I have the endorsement
of someone like you.

12:14.510 --> 12:15.580
You know what?

12:15.780 --> 12:17.080
If I don't get tenure here now,

12:17.280 --> 12:18.150
I will have to move,

12:18.350 --> 12:19.480
probably to, like, Nebraska
or something--

12:19.680 --> 12:20.350
Okay, I get it.

12:20.550 --> 12:21.990
Or I would stay an adjunct,

12:22.190 --> 12:23.490
and if I want to make
anything more than my rent,

12:23.690 --> 12:25.990
I've gotta keep tending bar
in this shithole!

12:26.190 --> 12:27.580
Sorry, guys,
you know I love you.

12:29.410 --> 12:30.830
Hank, don't tell me
that tenure's not a big deal

12:31.030 --> 12:32.600
when you have it.

12:32.800 --> 12:33.950
I'm not even on track for it.

12:36.580 --> 12:40.120
[**]

12:43.660 --> 12:45.110
You write it, I'll sign it,

12:45.310 --> 12:46.290
but I won't read it.

12:49.830 --> 12:52.350
I could write anything?

12:52.550 --> 12:54.140
Go nuts.

12:56.700 --> 12:57.890
That we're lovers?

12:58.090 --> 12:59.770
Yeah, if you think
that will help.

13:02.180 --> 13:03.660
Well, I'd have to
describe your penis.

13:03.860 --> 13:05.200
It's square.

13:05.400 --> 13:06.200
Color?

13:06.400 --> 13:07.580
Okay. Okay, go.

13:25.430 --> 13:28.390
[Finny] I have a friend
at Haverford.

13:28.590 --> 13:29.550
He told me they had an opening

13:29.750 --> 13:30.610
for a comp lit associate
last spring.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.330
They received 314 applicants.

13:33.530 --> 13:34.730
314!

13:34.930 --> 13:38.010
God, it is the worst time
to be an academic.

13:39.050 --> 13:40.270
Do you think they filled it yet?

13:40.470 --> 13:41.900
Mm... you're media studies.

13:42.100 --> 13:42.900
I could teach comp lit.

13:43.100 --> 13:44.400
- Emma.
- I could.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.770
No one from Railton
is getting a job at Haverford.

13:46.970 --> 13:48.540
Or anywhere.

13:48.740 --> 13:49.570
My point was the applicant pool

13:49.770 --> 13:51.260
was the largest
they've ever had.

13:52.860 --> 13:54.010
You don't have a friend
at Haverford.

13:54.210 --> 13:55.580
[Gracie] <i>Any attentive Dean</i>
<i>would know</i>

13:55.780 --> 13:58.250
Paul Rourke is not interested
in teaching freshman courses.

13:58.450 --> 14:00.090
Yes, Jacob, I do have a point,

14:00.290 --> 14:01.620
and that is...

14:01.820 --> 14:03.420
if there is a decision
to be made,

14:03.620 --> 14:04.620
it won't escape
anyone's attention

14:04.820 --> 14:06.190
that there are
two poetry professors

14:06.390 --> 14:07.260
in this department.

14:07.460 --> 14:09.430
One of them
is stuck in the 18th century,

14:09.630 --> 14:11.460
and the other receives
consistently higher cue scores

14:11.660 --> 14:13.120
and can teach anything
in the canon.

14:14.680 --> 14:15.870
Well, if you like my confidence,

14:16.070 --> 14:18.850
then you should tell Hank
what I just told you.

14:19.920 --> 14:21.110
Don't flirt with me, Jacob.

14:21.310 --> 14:23.040
I'm not in the mood.

14:23.240 --> 14:24.460
[ends call]

14:25.560 --> 14:28.450
The character's circumstances
are dark,

14:28.650 --> 14:30.120
and with the imagery
of light and darkness,

14:30.320 --> 14:31.120
- the...
- [door opening]

14:31.320 --> 14:32.950
...well, her inner monologue
is...

14:33.150 --> 14:34.220
is...

14:34.420 --> 14:35.290
energetic,

14:35.490 --> 14:36.420
so it never bogs down--

14:36.620 --> 14:38.310
I need to talk to you.

14:40.310 --> 14:42.980
This class
has three more minutes.

14:45.710 --> 14:48.230
[Hank, thinking]
<i>Some men can pull off a vest.</i>

14:48.430 --> 14:50.240
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if it's the shape of his arms,</i>

14:50.440 --> 14:52.910
<i>or just his vest-y attitude,</i>

14:53.110 --> 14:55.920
<i>either way,</i>
<i>I am jealous as hell.</i>

14:57.460 --> 14:58.730
Okay, class is over.

15:03.900 --> 15:05.150
They, uh...

15:05.350 --> 15:07.090
they tell me
you're going to make a list.

15:07.290 --> 15:09.650
Yeah, I'm looking
for my stencils.

15:09.850 --> 15:11.360
I'm thinking
of a decorative border.

15:11.560 --> 15:12.760
I spoke with Leslie Schonberg.

15:12.960 --> 15:15.530
Ms. Schonberg?

15:15.730 --> 15:17.500
Oh! My second-grade teacher.

15:17.700 --> 15:19.500
As our union rep,

15:19.700 --> 15:20.630
she says that
we don't have to take this,

15:20.830 --> 15:21.800
and I agree.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.700
I guess we could all
run away and hide together.

15:24.900 --> 15:26.040
We need a big enough building--

15:26.240 --> 15:28.510
abandoned factory, but spiders.

15:28.710 --> 15:29.610
Okay, shut up.

15:29.810 --> 15:31.510
Instead of a list,
here's what you do.

15:31.710 --> 15:33.550
You give them a signed statement
of solidarity,

15:33.750 --> 15:35.210
all the departments,
all the faculty.

15:35.410 --> 15:37.020
We make sure
those bozos in Harrisburg

15:37.220 --> 15:39.150
know that
we're not playing around.

15:39.350 --> 15:40.850
They won't want a full walk-out
on their hands.

15:41.050 --> 15:42.050
What if they do...

15:42.250 --> 15:44.470
want a full walk-out
on their hands?

15:46.340 --> 15:47.290
Why would they want that?

15:47.490 --> 15:49.310
To test out
their new sneaker gloves?

15:53.050 --> 15:54.480
What the hell is it with you?

15:55.620 --> 15:56.470
What do you even want?

15:56.670 --> 15:57.650
Whose side are you on?

15:59.690 --> 16:00.810
[door closes]

16:01.010 --> 16:02.040
We know
what we bring to the table.

16:02.240 --> 16:04.140
And we know you know.
We don't have to enumerate it.

16:04.340 --> 16:05.410
But do others know?

16:05.610 --> 16:07.210
Do they know about
our publications?

16:07.410 --> 16:08.550
Do they know about our scholar--

16:08.750 --> 16:11.050
Guys, can I just stop you
before you settle into a rhythm?

16:11.250 --> 16:12.050
And I appreciate you saying

16:12.250 --> 16:13.250
that this would be
a short meeting,

16:13.450 --> 16:16.150
but I have to ask
what the topic is.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.920
The cuts. The list.

16:18.120 --> 16:19.820
The list.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.260
- Hank told us.
- Oh.

16:21.460 --> 16:22.560
He told us you told him.

16:22.760 --> 16:23.560
And he told us

16:23.760 --> 16:24.760
that you told him
not to tell us,

16:24.960 --> 16:26.330
so you didn't hear this from us.

16:26.530 --> 16:28.100
[Teddy]
We know the university bias

16:28.300 --> 16:29.570
towards seniority.

16:29.770 --> 16:31.440
We're the most recent
tenure-track hires,

16:31.640 --> 16:34.240
and if seniority is, in fact,
an element here,

16:34.440 --> 16:35.440
we just need to make sure

16:35.640 --> 16:37.080
that people are acutely aware

16:37.280 --> 16:39.010
of everything else
we have to offer.

16:39.210 --> 16:41.580
Well, until the legislature,
which is 100 miles away,

16:41.780 --> 16:43.250
passes a budget for us,

16:43.450 --> 16:46.020
there's nothing to discuss.

16:46.220 --> 16:47.920
There's nothing for you to do,

16:48.120 --> 16:49.500
so there's no point in worrying.

16:54.580 --> 16:55.390
Okay, Dean...

16:55.590 --> 16:57.710
Okay. Okay.

16:58.250 --> 17:00.220
There is a new committee.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.140
I think we're a little
all over the place.

17:04.340 --> 17:06.050
Well, we need more members.

17:07.760 --> 17:08.970
What about your roommates?

17:09.170 --> 17:10.110
I can talk to them.

17:10.310 --> 17:11.230
What do they look like?

17:12.690 --> 17:13.550
If they're too hot,

17:13.750 --> 17:14.660
no one is going
to take us seriously.

17:15.760 --> 17:16.900
We need a mission statement.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.450
Yes, we do.

17:19.650 --> 17:20.950
Um...

17:21.150 --> 17:22.300
okay.

17:23.240 --> 17:23.960
Okay, take this down.

17:24.160 --> 17:25.620
Wait, so am I a secretary?

17:25.820 --> 17:27.130
- I'll do it.
- I'm doing it.

17:27.330 --> 17:29.640
Is this
the Excellence Committee?

17:32.110 --> 17:33.330
We're allowed to be here.

17:33.530 --> 17:35.420
Oh, we know.
We know.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.640
I'm Professor Washington-Chen,
and so is he.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.920
We are here
at Dean Rose's behest.

17:42.320 --> 17:44.030
We're your faculty advisors.

17:45.630 --> 17:48.110
Uh, that's an obvious
conflict of interest.

17:48.310 --> 17:50.620
No, no,
it's a confluence of interest.

17:50.820 --> 17:53.490
We couldn't be more on board
with what you're trying to do.

17:53.690 --> 17:54.450
Mm-hmm,

17:54.650 --> 17:55.750
and we believe that our support

17:55.950 --> 17:59.110
will help you have
a greater impact on the school.

18:01.140 --> 18:03.860
The community needs to know
that they can trust us,

18:04.060 --> 18:07.500
and that means that we need
to have some teeth,

18:07.700 --> 18:09.950
and at times,
we're going to need to bite.

18:11.290 --> 18:13.510
We can't have faculty saying
that we can't ruffle feathers.

18:13.710 --> 18:15.370
We're not pulling punches.

18:15.570 --> 18:16.840
[Teddy] Pull punches?

18:17.040 --> 18:18.610
No, no.

18:18.810 --> 18:19.710
No.

18:19.910 --> 18:21.980
Hey, look, we're here
to help you hit harder,

18:22.180 --> 18:23.380
bite better.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.150
Yeah, what was
the other metaphor?

18:25.350 --> 18:26.850
- Feathers.
- Right.

18:27.050 --> 18:28.600
Uh, fly higher.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.020
"Fly higher"?

18:33.230 --> 18:34.290
[Teddy] Mm-hmm.

18:34.490 --> 18:35.610
I like it.

18:36.510 --> 18:37.610
Take that down.
"Fly higher."

18:40.180 --> 18:41.480
[car horn honks]

18:48.520 --> 18:49.540
[woman sobbing]

18:49.740 --> 18:50.830
Hey.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.500
Hey, something wrong?

18:55.700 --> 18:57.330
Is something wrong?
What, are you kidding?

18:58.470 --> 18:59.650
Is this about that...?

18:59.850 --> 19:01.250
Well, obviously,
I'm gonna be on your list.

19:01.450 --> 19:02.750
You know what?
Never mind.

19:02.950 --> 19:04.360
- It's... just...
- I'm sorry.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.890
You know...
But think about--

19:06.090 --> 19:06.890
Sorry.

19:07.090 --> 19:08.510
But you don't have to--

30:26.770 --> 30:27.600
I'm fine.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.370
I was in the middle
of my column.

30:29.570 --> 30:32.080
Oliver, the homeless man
that lives on Rail Street,

30:32.280 --> 30:34.010
has been sent
to a halfway house.

30:34.210 --> 30:35.750
Apparently, he's happy there.

30:35.950 --> 30:37.700
Mom, there's something
I want to talk to you about.

30:40.500 --> 30:41.350
Oh.

30:41.550 --> 30:43.000
All right.

30:47.610 --> 30:49.340
Just tell me what these are.

30:51.250 --> 30:52.510
Oh, my goodness.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.030
He saved them.

30:55.230 --> 30:56.550
That can't be
the first thing you say.

30:57.920 --> 30:58.970
No.

30:59.170 --> 31:00.450
I see that.

31:01.860 --> 31:04.440
Hank, I have been corresponding
with your father

31:04.640 --> 31:05.480
for some time now.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.310
Yeah. Why don't you jump ahead

31:07.510 --> 31:09.710
to the part
that I haven't figured out

31:09.910 --> 31:10.950
from having read them already?

31:11.150 --> 31:12.980
You read my letters?

31:13.180 --> 31:14.050
No, no,

31:14.250 --> 31:15.450
you are not turning this
around on me.

31:15.650 --> 31:17.550
Now, what I did
was a minor infraction.

31:17.750 --> 31:19.070
What you did here was a felony.

31:21.040 --> 31:21.930
And what was the felony?

31:22.130 --> 31:23.290
Writing to my husband?

31:23.490 --> 31:25.430
Ex! Ex-husband.

31:25.630 --> 31:26.800
You know as well as I do

31:27.000 --> 31:27.930
you've been acting like

31:28.130 --> 31:29.900
we've been on the same page
this whole time,

31:30.100 --> 31:32.750
like he hasn't contacted you
either in 20 years.

31:34.460 --> 31:36.110
You're envious.

31:36.310 --> 31:37.490
Oh, my god.

31:38.830 --> 31:39.990
Oh, my god.

31:42.130 --> 31:44.280
I never made
any promises to you.

31:44.480 --> 31:45.900
You haven't?

31:47.130 --> 31:48.670
Don't you remember
when he left us?

31:49.640 --> 31:50.690
Hmm?

31:50.890 --> 31:52.110
You remember what happened?

31:54.480 --> 31:56.490
You said to me...

31:56.690 --> 31:58.080
"It's just you and me now."

31:59.780 --> 32:00.700
Oh, stop it.

32:00.900 --> 32:02.280
No, he abandoned us.

32:04.650 --> 32:05.790
He abandoned you.

32:07.690 --> 32:09.760
He moved away from me, and...

32:10.790 --> 32:11.960
...now he's moving back.

32:13.830 --> 32:15.880
No. No, he's not.

32:16.080 --> 32:17.280
Well, that's not
your decision, Hank.

32:17.480 --> 32:19.130
Yeah, well, it's partly mine.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.300
No, it's not.

32:22.440 --> 32:25.270
I've invited him to stay,
and he accepted.

32:26.770 --> 32:27.810
[Hank sighs]

32:36.720 --> 32:38.540
[Marnie] <i>You have reached</i>
<i>Professor Devereaux's office.</i>

32:38.740 --> 32:40.540

32:40.740 --> 32:41.540

32:41.740 --> 32:43.870
Hey, Dad, it's Hank.

32:44.080 --> 32:45.480
Your son.

32:45.680 --> 32:47.210
Couple things.

32:47.410 --> 32:50.380
One, congrats
on your retirement.

32:50.580 --> 32:52.920
I hope you have
some plans to relax.

32:53.120 --> 32:56.520
I was meaning to send you
a set of paints.

32:56.720 --> 32:58.060
That worked well for George W.,

32:58.260 --> 32:59.390
which...

32:59.590 --> 33:01.330
that brings me to number two.

33:01.530 --> 33:03.660
It's kind of the big one.

33:03.860 --> 33:06.160
I've been holding on
to a lot of anger towards you,

33:06.360 --> 33:08.670
and the more I think about it...

33:08.870 --> 33:10.930
the more...

33:11.140 --> 33:12.740
appropriate it seems.

33:12.940 --> 33:14.910
It's well-earned.

33:15.110 --> 33:16.770
So...

33:16.970 --> 33:18.330
you're not welcome here.

33:19.530 --> 33:20.940
Don't come to Railton.

33:21.150 --> 33:22.530
Enjoy the rest of the globe.

33:27.570 --> 33:28.700
[Julie] <i>Dad?</i>

33:30.570 --> 33:31.840
Dad, are you okay?

33:33.170 --> 33:34.280
Dad?

33:37.240 --> 33:39.180
Did you really
not hear me come in?

33:40.510 --> 33:41.600
Is one of you moving out?

33:41.800 --> 33:42.770
Huh? What?

33:42.970 --> 33:44.190
The moving pod out front?

33:46.420 --> 33:47.850
Uh...

33:49.090 --> 33:50.140
It's true, isn't it?

33:50.340 --> 33:51.640
You know, I knew something
was going on with you guys.

33:51.840 --> 33:53.580
What? No.
It's a mistake.

33:53.780 --> 33:55.630
I'm taking care of that.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.470
What-- You want to sit down,
stay for lunch?

34:00.930 --> 34:01.790
Yeah.

34:01.990 --> 34:03.320
All right.
I've got some...

34:03.520 --> 34:07.570
I've got some good bread
and, uh, ham and cheese.

34:09.140 --> 34:10.560
I can make a grilled cheese.

34:10.760 --> 34:12.750
[Julie] Dad, I think
I'm in over my head.

34:16.780 --> 34:17.800
I just...

34:18.000 --> 34:19.970
I don't know. I don't know.
I just feel...

34:20.170 --> 34:22.260
Let's talk about it.
We'll figure it out.

34:24.960 --> 34:27.280
I started on this path
a while ago,

34:27.480 --> 34:29.480
and I started making
all these choices,

34:29.680 --> 34:30.510
and...

34:30.710 --> 34:32.680
- like with the pool.
- Uh-huh.

34:32.880 --> 34:33.750
[sighs]

34:33.950 --> 34:35.320
I just feel like...

34:35.520 --> 34:36.990
I started on this path
a while ago,

34:37.190 --> 34:38.860
and then I started making
all these choices,

34:39.060 --> 34:40.660
like with the pool,

34:40.860 --> 34:43.960
and now there's
a freaking rented backhoe

34:44.160 --> 34:45.660
stuck in a hole in my backyard,

34:45.860 --> 34:47.700
and I don't know
how to get it out,

34:47.900 --> 34:50.330
and everything is starting
to feel really overwhelming.

34:50.530 --> 34:51.940
Yes, well, that's okay.

34:52.140 --> 34:54.590
I mean,
everybody gets there sometimes.

34:55.660 --> 34:56.610
Yeah?

34:56.810 --> 34:58.040
Here's the great thing, right?

34:58.240 --> 34:59.680
You're not locked in.

34:59.880 --> 35:02.110
Right? You can get out.

35:02.310 --> 35:03.450
You're 24.

35:03.650 --> 35:04.800
You can do anything.

35:08.270 --> 35:09.020
Yeah, I know.

35:09.220 --> 35:10.190
What do you--
what do you mean?

35:10.390 --> 35:12.860
You can move to New York,

35:13.060 --> 35:13.860
or Nashville,

35:14.060 --> 35:16.060
anywhere
where there's opportunity.

35:16.260 --> 35:17.690
What are you talking about?

35:17.890 --> 35:19.360
Are you trying
to get me to leave?

35:19.560 --> 35:20.480
No.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.480
Well...

35:23.450 --> 35:24.640
Oh, my god.

35:24.840 --> 35:26.320
Oh, my god!

35:27.350 --> 35:29.670
I was talking about
one DIY project that went wrong,

35:29.870 --> 35:30.910
one project,

35:31.110 --> 35:32.340
and now you're trying to use it
to kick me out of town?

35:32.540 --> 35:33.410
I'm not kicking you out.

35:33.610 --> 35:34.480
Yeah, I'm not an idiot, Dad.

35:34.680 --> 35:35.650
I didn't understand.

35:35.850 --> 35:37.050
It is obvious to me

35:37.250 --> 35:39.480
that I have not lived up
to all of your expectations--

35:39.680 --> 35:40.550
I never said anything--

35:40.750 --> 35:41.550
I didn't go to grad school,

35:41.750 --> 35:42.890
or, like,
write a bunch of books,

35:43.090 --> 35:44.720
and I'm not super ambitious
like you and Grandpa,

35:44.920 --> 35:46.220
and I'm sorry.

35:46.420 --> 35:48.730
I'm so sorry
that my whole life goal

35:48.930 --> 35:52.930
wasn't to, like,
achieve stuff, or something,

35:53.130 --> 35:56.180
but I like it here,
and I'm going to stay here.

36:02.990 --> 36:04.190
You don't have anything to say?

36:08.330 --> 36:09.760
You rented a backhoe?

36:22.410 --> 36:23.240
Here.

36:23.740 --> 36:24.930
For your troubles.

36:25.130 --> 36:26.350
Thanks.

36:27.410 --> 36:28.780
I'm gonna need
a lot more of these.

36:29.850 --> 36:31.390
Okay, so it's true.

36:33.450 --> 36:34.960
How deep are the cuts going?

36:36.090 --> 36:37.610
I don't know.

36:37.810 --> 36:39.940
Oh...
My mom is really worried.

36:40.140 --> 36:41.210
Yeah.

36:41.410 --> 36:44.060
Yeah, she is not doing great.

36:47.430 --> 36:49.320
Hank, I'm not blaming you.

36:49.520 --> 36:50.450
I'll take care of her
if I need to.

36:50.650 --> 36:51.660
You know that.

36:51.860 --> 36:52.790
Well, you're
a lot better daughter

36:52.990 --> 36:54.060

36:54.260 --> 36:55.790

for my father

36:55.990 --> 36:58.460
telling him
he's not welcome here, ever.

36:58.660 --> 36:59.660
Did you really?

36:59.860 --> 37:00.660
Yeah, I did.

37:00.860 --> 37:02.270
You don't even
like it here, Hank.

37:02.470 --> 37:03.230
Nobody does.

37:03.430 --> 37:04.640
Yeah, no shit.
We should all get out.

37:04.840 --> 37:07.070
Can't. Tenure.

37:07.270 --> 37:08.660
Can't. Mother.

Your scholarship covers
all the hot topics.

No.

41:29.100 --> 41:32.340
Uh, we did end up
in the bedroom,

41:32.540 --> 41:34.070
and clothes were shed.

41:34.270 --> 41:35.260
I mean, hers, not mine.

41:37.060 --> 41:38.190
Is that-- is that true?

41:39.430 --> 41:42.010
And I was forced to flee
to protect her honor,

41:42.210 --> 41:42.910
and my honor,

41:43.110 --> 41:44.330
and your honor.

41:46.900 --> 41:48.540
How lucky for all of us
that you were there.

41:50.900 --> 41:52.860
Thank you.

41:53.060 --> 41:53.920
She was really upset

41:54.120 --> 41:54.930
because I told her

41:55.130 --> 41:57.430
classes aren't happening
for her this fall.

41:57.630 --> 41:58.860
[Lily] That's terrible.

41:59.060 --> 42:00.360
[Hank] No, it's not.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.430
Somebody has to kick her
out of the nest.

42:02.630 --> 42:04.130
I told her the classes...

42:04.330 --> 42:05.600
well, they're cut.

42:05.800 --> 42:06.940
But are they?

42:07.140 --> 42:09.060
[Hank] Well, no.

42:12.960 --> 42:14.140
Did you lie to her?

42:14.340 --> 42:15.810
Well, she was never
going to leave.

42:16.010 --> 42:17.780
She thinks she has to
take care of her mom.

42:17.980 --> 42:19.780
Somebody has to end
this madness for her.

42:19.980 --> 42:22.720
[Lily] But she had told you
that she wanted to stay.

42:22.920 --> 42:23.950
Jesus Christ, Hank.

42:24.150 --> 42:25.390
You're projecting
all of your shit

42:25.590 --> 42:26.460
onto everybody else.

42:26.660 --> 42:27.990
What?

42:28.190 --> 42:30.230
Julie, Meg,

42:30.430 --> 42:32.960
telling everybody
they should leave town.

42:33.160 --> 42:34.080
What is that?

42:38.890 --> 42:39.890
Do you hate it here?

42:42.120 --> 42:43.490
I take the fifth.

42:45.130 --> 42:46.590
You can't treat...

42:50.800 --> 42:52.100
Forget it.

43:10.250 --> 43:11.250
I talked to Tom.

43:12.450 --> 43:13.670
I'm going to go
to New York this week.

43:13.870 --> 43:16.120
I'm going to interview
for that Arlyle job.

43:17.620 --> 43:21.510
Yeah? You...

43:21.710 --> 43:22.960
Okay.

All: No cutting jobs!
Woman: You spelled
"humanities" wrong.

43:55.750 --> 43:57.380
I know that you care about
those professors,

43:57.580 --> 44:00.050
despite the fact that
you would never admit that.

44:00.250 --> 44:01.380
President Dickie Pope.

44:01.580 --> 44:02.890
You are the only
department head

44:03.090 --> 44:04.990
who has not submitted a list
of faculty to cut.

44:05.190 --> 44:06.990
In that way
I'm outstanding.

44:07.190 --> 44:09.660
Lily.
This interview could
give me some leverage.

44:09.860 --> 44:10.730
Leverage?

44:10.930 --> 44:13.360
The key thing
to any organized protest

44:13.560 --> 44:14.670
is that we're unified.

44:14.870 --> 44:16.400
I will box a goose a day.
