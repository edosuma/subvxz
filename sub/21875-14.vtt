00:42.870 --> 00:44.400
( whispering ):
Looks like there's only

00:44.410 --> 00:46.770
two guards down there, Paco.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.340
Well, let's get ready
to rumble.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.980
Apache One
to Apache Two.

00:50.980 --> 00:53.210
Ready, Apache One.

01:04.160 --> 01:05.560
That's a nice jacket,
Trivette.

01:06.630 --> 01:09.200
Yeah, genuine sheepskin.
Brand new, huh.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.800
Yeah.

01:10.800 --> 01:11.830
Can I see it for a minute?

01:15.640 --> 01:17.240
Yeah.

01:17.240 --> 01:18.270
We're the same size.

01:19.340 --> 01:20.340
Yeah.

01:22.240 --> 01:23.540
Here.

01:23.550 --> 01:24.710
Boy, it is nice.

01:25.950 --> 01:27.050
Wha--? You!

01:33.420 --> 01:35.390
You--

01:51.940 --> 01:53.840
( clattering )

01:53.840 --> 01:54.840
Hey, Jose.

01:59.780 --> 02:01.380
Oh!
Ugh!

02:05.290 --> 02:06.620
How come I always get
the big guy?

02:06.620 --> 02:08.590
Just lucky,
I guess.

02:08.590 --> 02:10.660
( chattering in Spanish )

02:18.300 --> 02:19.430
WALKER:
Hey!

02:20.640 --> 02:21.640
Texas Rangers!

02:21.640 --> 02:23.300
DEA! Freeze!
Right now!

MAN 2: Hands up!

02:33.750 --> 02:37.150
Don't you guys just hate
days like this?

02:41.560 --> 02:43.860
MAN:
Paco Cruz again.

02:43.860 --> 02:44.860
MAN 2:
Who's with him?

02:44.860 --> 02:47.530
Some Texas Ranger.

02:47.530 --> 02:49.730
You want a two for Chuchu?

02:49.730 --> 02:52.070
I can take Cruz
and the Ranger out together.

02:52.070 --> 02:53.530
Right now.

02:53.540 --> 02:56.070
Save it,<i> ese.</i>

02:56.070 --> 02:59.570
Durazo has some plans
for Cruz.

02:59.580 --> 03:02.610
Big-time plans.

04:00.900 --> 04:03.170
These ribs don't get
nothing but better.

04:03.170 --> 04:06.640
It's-- It's all
in the sauce, Paco.

04:06.640 --> 04:08.340
My own special blend.

04:08.340 --> 04:09.380
Yeah?
Yeah.

04:10.780 --> 04:13.610
You oughta franchise that, man.
You can make a fortune.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.019
Really?
Yeah.

04:17.490 --> 04:18.890
You mean, kinda like Paul Newman

04:18.890 --> 04:21.390
on the salad dressing label.
Yeah.

04:21.390 --> 04:23.060
I looked like Newman
when I was a young man.

04:23.060 --> 04:24.420
Yeah?
I really did. I--

04:24.430 --> 04:25.590
There's still a resemblance.

04:25.590 --> 04:26.830
I mean, you can see.

04:26.830 --> 04:28.730
Yeah!
Still resemble him in a way.

04:28.730 --> 04:30.260
The side of my face here.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.070
I see it!

04:32.070 --> 04:33.770
( laughing )

04:35.000 --> 04:36.740
What's happening, Jimmy?

04:36.740 --> 04:38.940
Same thing, big dog.
Some more nuts.

04:38.940 --> 04:41.140
Somebody new?

04:43.150 --> 04:45.110
( huffs )

04:45.110 --> 04:46.880
Are you still upset
about the jacket?

04:46.880 --> 04:49.750
I told you
it would be replaced.

04:51.190 --> 04:53.790
Jiminy Crickets!
I'll buy it for you myself.

04:53.790 --> 04:55.560
Buy me what?

04:55.560 --> 04:56.590
Hey, he speaks!

04:56.590 --> 04:57.920
( laughs )

04:57.930 --> 04:59.430
PACO:
So tell me, Trivette,

04:59.430 --> 05:01.660
how do you like working
with this guy?

05:01.660 --> 05:03.530
It's hard on my wardrobe.

05:07.070 --> 05:08.740
But I gotta admit,
it's never been dull.

05:08.740 --> 05:10.700
At least, not yet.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.770
So what? You used to diss him
about his clothes too?

05:14.340 --> 05:16.240
Paco and I go
a long way back.

05:16.240 --> 05:17.840
Oof.

05:17.850 --> 05:19.210
In fact,
our first assignment,

05:19.210 --> 05:22.050
I was new on the Department
of Public Safety,

05:22.050 --> 05:24.650
and you'd just started
with the DEA.
Yeah.

05:24.650 --> 05:27.320
And that was the beginning
of a beautiful relationship.

05:27.320 --> 05:28.520
You got it.

05:28.520 --> 05:30.860
( both laugh )

05:30.860 --> 05:31.860
Jimmy.

05:31.860 --> 05:32.960
What?

05:32.960 --> 05:34.730
Come here.

05:40.870 --> 05:41.870
What?

05:43.070 --> 05:45.170
Jimmy, you know how it is
with old friends.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.880
I wasn't bothering 'em.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.180
To Cobra.

05:50.180 --> 05:52.110
Who's that?

05:52.110 --> 05:54.250
Our agent in Mexico
who fed us the coke mill.

05:54.250 --> 05:57.650
Well, I hope I get a chance to
meet him sometime and thank him.

05:57.650 --> 05:59.650
Cobra's a little
tied up right now.

05:59.660 --> 06:02.590
Has Emilio Durazo
staked out.

06:02.590 --> 06:04.720
That's the guy who bankrolled
the mill we just took down.

06:05.460 --> 06:07.590
Emilio Durazo.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.560
Head of the Mexican mafia,
right?

06:09.570 --> 06:11.970
Not for long, if I have
anything to do with it.

06:11.970 --> 06:13.730
Sounds personal.

06:13.740 --> 06:16.900
You're right.
This is personal for me.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.840
As personal as it gets.

06:19.840 --> 06:22.840
This man is responsible
for killing children.

06:22.850 --> 06:25.750
Babies born with drugs
in their veins.

06:25.750 --> 06:29.720
A whole generation of kids
with no chance at a decent life.

06:29.720 --> 06:33.150
Paco, you know what happens

06:33.150 --> 06:34.820
when you get
emotionally involved.

06:34.820 --> 06:35.990
You get careless.

06:35.990 --> 06:38.020
Look who's talking.

06:38.030 --> 06:41.760
Well, watch your back,
will ya?

06:41.760 --> 06:43.060
Don't I always?

06:55.980 --> 06:56.980
Ugh.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.910
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

07:16.970 --> 07:19.470
The cocaine mill
was a nice bust, Walker.

07:19.470 --> 07:20.630
Clean.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.970
No loose ends for me
to chase for a change.

07:22.970 --> 07:25.470
Are you tryin'
to make a point here?

07:25.470 --> 07:28.480
Well, I can only interpret
your ongoing relationship

07:28.480 --> 07:29.980
with other agencies
as tenuous.

07:29.980 --> 07:31.140
Tenuous.

07:31.150 --> 07:33.650
Does that mean I'm not
the caring, sensitive,

07:33.650 --> 07:35.150
nineties type of guy?

07:35.150 --> 07:37.380
Well, sometimes, my dear,

07:37.390 --> 07:39.090
a little diplomacy
would go a lot further

07:39.090 --> 07:40.550
than kicking down doors.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.120
But it wouldn't be
as much fun.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.360
How's Paco?

07:45.360 --> 07:46.730
Great. It's good to see him.

07:46.730 --> 07:49.530
Yeah. Oh, one more thing.

07:49.530 --> 07:51.460
Trivette's expense sheet.

07:51.470 --> 07:52.930
"One sheepskin jacket,

07:52.930 --> 07:56.270
$648.37"?

07:56.270 --> 07:57.400
Is that what he said?

07:57.410 --> 07:58.700
Uh-huh.

07:58.710 --> 08:00.870
That jacket wasn't worth
more than 50 bucks.

08:02.210 --> 08:03.910
I wouldn't let him
get away with that.

08:03.910 --> 08:05.480
Okay.

08:13.250 --> 08:14.820
Uh, Jimmy.

08:14.820 --> 08:17.860
We were just going over
your expense sheet, and--

08:17.860 --> 08:20.060
Walker, I have some bad news.

08:20.060 --> 08:21.660
It's Paco Cruz.

08:21.660 --> 08:23.000
What about him?

08:23.000 --> 08:26.100
You know Marlene,
that DEA clerk I've been seeing?

08:26.100 --> 08:28.670
She says that Paco's been
missing since last night.

08:28.670 --> 08:30.600
DEA got word
through an informant

08:30.610 --> 08:32.470
that he's been abducted.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.470
He was with me at C.D.'s.

08:34.480 --> 08:36.080
He left just a few minutes
before I did.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.010
Well, who do they suspect?

08:38.010 --> 08:39.450
Mexican mafia.

08:39.450 --> 08:41.179
Emilio Durazo.

08:41.179 --> 08:42.580
Walker, they have to be
pulling out

08:42.580 --> 08:44.350
all the stops to find him.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.490
Don't give me that look.

08:48.490 --> 08:50.490
This is out of our jurisdiction.

08:50.490 --> 08:52.930
Please just let
the Feds handle it.

08:54.060 --> 08:56.160
(<i> resolute theme playing</i> )

08:58.130 --> 08:59.800
He never listens.

09:06.140 --> 09:08.110
Just a moment, please.
Can I help you, sir?

09:08.110 --> 09:09.580
Name's Walker.
I phoned.

09:09.580 --> 09:12.080
Mr. Walker, I told you
Mr. Maddox was not available.

09:13.010 --> 09:14.980
Mr. Maddox, I'm sorry.
He just...

09:14.980 --> 09:17.580
I'll have to get back
with you.

09:17.590 --> 09:20.290
Well, you must be Walker.
( door closes)

09:20.290 --> 09:22.320
And you must be the guy
I can't get on the phone.

09:22.320 --> 09:25.460
Do I sense an atmosphere
of tension here?

09:25.460 --> 09:27.060
Let's cut to the chase, Maddox.

09:27.060 --> 09:28.900
I'm here about Paco Cruz.

09:28.900 --> 09:31.500
Fine. Let's do be concise.

09:31.500 --> 09:34.970
You're with Cruz for a few
joint undercover operations.

09:34.970 --> 09:36.040
More than a few.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.540
Whatever.

09:37.540 --> 09:40.010
You're here because you're
concerned with his safety.

09:40.010 --> 09:41.510
However, I'm not at liberty

09:41.510 --> 09:43.710
to discuss
his situation with you.

09:43.710 --> 09:45.880
Then you're confirming
that he was kidnapped.

09:45.880 --> 09:48.920
I can speak only
on a need-to-know basis.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.220
Now, I appreciate
your professionalism

09:51.220 --> 09:53.050
and care, Walker.

09:53.050 --> 09:55.060
But you're not part
of the equation.

09:55.060 --> 09:57.160
I've just become
part of the equation.

09:58.730 --> 10:02.300
Okay, off the record.

10:02.300 --> 10:04.730
All we know for sure is
that he was last seen

10:04.730 --> 10:05.730
in Cortelano, Mexico.

10:05.730 --> 10:06.970
What have you done
to find him?

10:06.970 --> 10:08.500
Everything we can.

10:08.500 --> 10:09.900
You haven't answered
my question.

10:13.170 --> 10:16.210
We've concluded our business,
Ranger Walker.

10:16.210 --> 10:18.710
Yeah, we have.

10:24.220 --> 10:25.290
( door slams shut )

10:25.290 --> 10:28.090
(<i> melancholy theme playing</i> )

10:38.900 --> 10:40.830
You okay, Washoe?

10:40.840 --> 10:41.830
Yeah.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.170
Just thinking.

10:43.170 --> 10:45.270
Ah.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.270
Here, I made some tea.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.110
Some of my own
secret ingredients

10:50.110 --> 10:51.650
to induce serenity.

10:51.650 --> 10:53.150
What's in it?

10:53.150 --> 10:54.210
Well, if I told you,

10:54.220 --> 10:56.720
it wouldn't be
a secret anymore.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.550
( sighs )

10:58.550 --> 11:01.650
You know, I remember Paco,
he visited the ranch.

11:01.660 --> 11:02.790
He was a good man.

11:04.360 --> 11:05.660
He is a good man.

11:05.660 --> 11:08.330
If he's still alive.

11:08.330 --> 11:09.630
If they'd a wanted
to kill him,

11:09.630 --> 11:12.430
they'd a killed him
last night at C.D.'s.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.440
You know, Washoe,

11:15.440 --> 11:17.040
I know you feel
you must have to act

11:17.040 --> 11:19.070
in order to help your friend,
but you also

11:19.070 --> 11:21.210
took an oath
to uphold the law.

11:21.210 --> 11:23.510
I know that,

11:23.510 --> 11:26.480
but I've gotta do something,

11:26.480 --> 11:28.650
even if it means
going into Mexico.

11:28.650 --> 11:31.820
Well, then you must do

11:31.820 --> 11:34.150
what I know you've
already decided to do.

11:34.160 --> 11:35.390
( sighs )

11:35.390 --> 11:36.560
Let's go.

11:36.560 --> 11:37.560
( horse neighs )

11:49.170 --> 11:50.900
WALKER:
Hand me that rope, Trivette.

11:52.210 --> 11:54.410
You've got enough stuff
to take out an army, man.

11:54.410 --> 11:56.040
I may have to.

11:56.040 --> 11:57.480
Then I should go along.

11:57.480 --> 12:01.410
It's not your fight.
Hand me that 950.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.080
Uncle Ray,
you gonna help me out?

12:03.090 --> 12:06.290
Ain't no use trying to stop
Washoe when his mind's made up.

12:06.290 --> 12:07.590
( car approaches )

12:19.970 --> 12:22.770
Walker, what in the world
do you think you're doing?

12:22.770 --> 12:24.970
Going on vacation.

12:24.970 --> 12:26.140
Hand me that box of ammo.

12:26.140 --> 12:27.640
You're going across the border.

12:29.010 --> 12:31.010
Your badge
doesn't mean anything.

12:31.010 --> 12:32.610
So what you're doing
is you're walking

12:32.610 --> 12:34.750
into hell.

12:34.750 --> 12:37.480
With no resources.

12:37.490 --> 12:38.550
No backup.

12:38.550 --> 12:39.720
Uncle Ray.

12:39.720 --> 12:42.020
I'm outta this.
I'm gonna make some tea.

12:47.130 --> 12:49.430
I'll send you a postcard.

12:49.430 --> 12:52.200
(<i> country theme playing</i> )

13:08.620 --> 13:10.080
Mm.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.390
And don't let me forget to call
Judge Grasos in the morning.

13:12.390 --> 13:14.820
It's very important.

13:14.820 --> 13:16.320
Can I talk to you
for a minute, Alex?

13:16.320 --> 13:17.560
Sure.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.560
Just a second, Myra.

13:22.160 --> 13:25.160
While I'm sitting out there,
I could... I don't like it.

13:25.170 --> 13:26.830
I mean, he could be
walking into a firestorm

13:26.830 --> 13:28.670
down there in Mexico.

13:28.670 --> 13:31.400
I know that.
But what can we do?

13:31.410 --> 13:33.070
We gotta do something, Alex.

13:33.070 --> 13:34.470
I've been trying.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.640
Call the attorney general.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.080
Already spoke to him.

13:37.080 --> 13:38.210
He referred me back to the DEA.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.510
I gotta do something.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.750
You know
what I gotta do?

13:42.750 --> 13:45.020
I gotta start
thinking like Walker.

13:45.020 --> 13:46.820
Jimmy! Please.

13:46.820 --> 13:48.290
( sarcastically ):
That's all I need.

14:30.700 --> 14:31.730
Hey, Vargas.

14:31.730 --> 14:34.100
Walker, what are you
doing here?

14:34.100 --> 14:36.000
I'm looking for Paco Cruz.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.570
Your timing is perfect, hombre.

14:38.570 --> 14:41.510
I just got in a new shipment
of expensive watches.

14:41.510 --> 14:43.680
Here. Let me show you.

14:46.150 --> 14:48.180
The word is Emilio Durazo
snatched him.

14:48.180 --> 14:49.980
That's who I'm tracking.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.720
Huh. Then he's probably
tracking you by now, Walker.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.120
I hope so.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.960
Ah, you don't want to find
this guy,<i> amigo.</i>

14:55.960 --> 14:57.220
He's as bad as they come.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.660
He's way out
in the country someplace.

15:03.670 --> 15:06.570
I don't know where, but I saw
one of his men in town today.

15:06.570 --> 15:07.900
Chuchu Sanchez.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.940
He passed right by here
maybe an hour ago,

15:09.940 --> 15:11.070
bragging to a couple

15:11.070 --> 15:14.410
of his friends about
picking up a car for Durazo.

15:14.410 --> 15:15.740
Something very expensive.

15:15.740 --> 15:16.910
( chuckles )

15:16.910 --> 15:19.140
He was all excited
because he gets to drive

15:19.150 --> 15:20.980
Durazo around in it
all the time.

15:20.980 --> 15:22.750
Did he say where
he's going to pick it up?

15:22.750 --> 15:25.520
Hombre, there's only
one dealer in this town.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.790
Bernardo Lopez.

Now, this a nice one.

15:33.790 --> 15:34.930

15:36.400 --> 15:39.270
Paco had an undercover contact.

15:39.270 --> 15:41.770

15:41.770 --> 15:44.470
Uh, Cobra's in deep cover.

Do you know where?

15:46.070 --> 15:47.910
No one knows but Paco.

want to buy a watch?

BERNARDO:
Slowly, slowly.

16:05.860 --> 16:06.860
Careful!

16:09.060 --> 16:10.100
She's a beauty, no?

16:10.100 --> 16:13.000
I told you to take it easy!

16:13.000 --> 16:14.230
You can get out
of the car now.

16:18.440 --> 16:19.910
She's the perfect color too.

16:19.910 --> 16:21.140
Uh, I think.

16:21.140 --> 16:23.280
Is it what
Mr. Durazo ordered?

16:23.280 --> 16:24.640
Oh, yes,<i> señor.</i>

16:24.650 --> 16:27.150
This is exactly the car
Mr. Durazo ordered.

16:27.150 --> 16:29.180
I made sure of that myself.

16:29.180 --> 16:30.850
What about the leather?

16:30.850 --> 16:32.750
Genuine catskin.

16:32.750 --> 16:34.820
I thought we said lambskin.

16:36.190 --> 16:38.220
Oh, w-well, yes, of course!

16:38.230 --> 16:39.990
And that's exactly
what it is too.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.630
Better be.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.300
Huh?

16:51.310 --> 16:52.710

17:17.800 --> 17:20.670
You're the Ranger was with Cruz
the other night, huh.

17:20.670 --> 17:23.369
Well, if you know that, then you
must know where Cruz is.

17:23.369 --> 17:25.540
Don't know what
you're talking about.

17:25.540 --> 17:26.540
Oh?

17:28.410 --> 17:29.840
Does that jog your memory?

17:29.840 --> 17:31.310
Maybe you should
call up Information

17:31.310 --> 17:32.750
for his phone number.

17:32.750 --> 17:35.620
Tell Durazo I'm coming for him.

17:35.620 --> 17:36.850
( grunts )

17:40.990 --> 17:42.790

for the car already?

You're here to see
that Durazo doesn't get bored.

That I don't get bored.

20:22.080 --> 20:23.680
Why, now, do you tell me this?

20:23.690 --> 20:24.920
Because...

Look, Ms. Cahill,

20:31.190 --> 20:32.590

if I didn't feel
the situation was critical.

20:35.130 --> 20:36.600
But I hear
you're close to Walker,

20:36.600 --> 20:38.130
and right now,
he's into something

20:38.130 --> 20:39.870
way over his head.

20:39.870 --> 20:41.830
He's been seen
in Cortelano, Mexico,

20:41.840 --> 20:43.470
looking for Paco Cruz.

20:43.470 --> 20:45.370
I can't verify that.

20:45.370 --> 20:47.970
Really? Well, I can.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.010
And if you hear from him,

20:49.010 --> 20:50.740
you better tell him
to get his butt

20:50.740 --> 20:52.980
back over the border pronto,

20:52.980 --> 20:55.350
or he's at risk of losing
his badge. Or worse.

20:55.350 --> 20:56.750
You don't have that authority.

20:56.750 --> 20:59.120
Others do, and they're prepared
to move on it.

21:00.190 --> 21:02.520
Wait a minute.
Paco Cruz is your man.

21:02.520 --> 21:05.490
I would think that you'd want
to get him out too.

21:05.490 --> 21:07.990

21:10.600 --> 21:11.830
Sometimes not.

21:11.830 --> 21:14.230
And sometimes individuals
must be sacrificed.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.800
That's barbaric.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.400
That's the way it is,

21:17.410 --> 21:19.810
and your friend Walker's caught
right in the middle of it.

21:19.810 --> 21:21.340
So, what are you saying?

21:21.340 --> 21:23.880
Right now, he's operating
on his own.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.910
His badge is meaningless
down there.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.910
He's a man without a country.

21:27.920 --> 21:31.050
If he gets caught by either
side, he's gonna go down.

21:31.050 --> 21:32.990
And you won't lift a finger.

24:53.790 --> 24:54.790
What happened?

24:56.990 --> 25:00.830
What happens so often
the world has stopped noticing.

25:00.830 --> 25:03.160
Like so many other children
in Mexico

25:03.160 --> 25:06.160
looking for a way out,
looking for something better,

25:06.170 --> 25:09.800
she wound up being
a prostitute for Durazo.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.740
Then on drugs.

25:12.940 --> 25:14.710
Then overdosing.

25:14.710 --> 25:18.680
We'll take care of Durazo.
You don't have to go back there.

25:18.680 --> 25:20.510
No, the hacienda's
like a fortress.

25:20.510 --> 25:22.380
You won't be able
to get in without me.

25:22.380 --> 25:23.380
We'll find a way.

25:23.380 --> 25:25.380
I have to go back.

25:25.390 --> 25:28.250
If I don't, Durazo will know
something is wrong.

25:28.260 --> 25:29.860
He will kill Paco.

25:29.860 --> 25:31.960
And if Paco dies,

25:31.960 --> 25:34.430
it will be because
he was protecting me.

25:39.700 --> 25:40.730
MARIA:
Okay, Durazo keeps

25:40.730 --> 25:43.200
three Dobermans
on the grounds.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.540
TRIVETTE:
Dobermans.

25:44.540 --> 25:45.940
They have Dobermans.

25:45.940 --> 25:46.970
So?

25:46.970 --> 25:49.370
So the last time
we ran into Dobermans,

25:49.380 --> 25:52.780
I almost lost a very nice,
very expensive pair of boots.

25:52.780 --> 25:55.710
Not to mention a leg.
( helicopter whirring )

25:55.720 --> 25:57.580
So I don't like dogs
that don't have hair on them.

25:57.590 --> 25:59.480
MARIA:
Don't worry,
I'll take care of 'em.

25:59.490 --> 26:00.890
WALKER:
What about the guards?

26:00.890 --> 26:02.220
They rotate
at intervals.

26:02.220 --> 26:04.960
Four are left outside
for the night after 2 a.m.

26:04.960 --> 26:06.760
Do you know where
the alarm system's at?

26:06.760 --> 26:08.260
The main panel's
near the front door.

26:08.260 --> 26:10.060
What about
the surveillance cameras?

26:10.060 --> 26:12.330
At the gate, front entrance.

26:12.330 --> 26:13.700
You know, it's gonna
take an army

26:13.700 --> 26:15.670
to get through that
security system, Walker.

26:15.670 --> 26:17.100
How are we gonna do it?

26:18.970 --> 26:20.470
We're gonna surround 'em.

26:22.010 --> 26:24.540
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

26:24.550 --> 26:26.480
You got a lot of heart, Cruz.

26:26.480 --> 26:28.210
I'll give you that.

26:28.220 --> 26:30.220
You refuse
to show weakness.

26:31.420 --> 26:33.590
The mark of a man.

26:33.590 --> 26:35.520
But now the thrill
is gone, my man!

26:35.520 --> 26:37.290
I wanna know
who sold me out.

26:37.290 --> 26:39.220
No more foreplay, man!

26:39.230 --> 26:40.360
Talk to me!

26:40.360 --> 26:42.130
You're scared,
aren't you, Durazo?

26:44.330 --> 26:48.630
You're scared because
you know he's out there.

26:48.640 --> 26:50.640
And you know
he's coming for you.

26:52.340 --> 26:53.670
You find this man,

26:53.670 --> 26:56.010
and you bring him to me.
Alive.

26:56.010 --> 26:57.880
Okay? You understand me?

26:57.880 --> 26:58.940
<i> Sí, jefe.</i>

26:58.950 --> 27:00.180
I'll kill him myself!

27:00.180 --> 27:01.680
Do it!

27:03.420 --> 27:05.780
( chattering in Spanish )

27:22.040 --> 27:23.040
Hey, hombre.

27:24.070 --> 27:26.410
Sorry,<i> amigo.</i>
We're closed.

27:26.410 --> 27:28.210
Maybe for good.

27:28.210 --> 27:29.440
Oh!

27:30.340 --> 27:31.680
I heard you were talking

27:31.680 --> 27:33.180
to a Texas Ranger
this afternoon, huh!

27:33.180 --> 27:36.650
I don't know.
I talk to a lot of people.

27:36.650 --> 27:38.220
Oh!

27:38.220 --> 27:41.620
How many gringos come
to this dust hole, huh?

27:41.620 --> 27:42.790
Many, hombre.

27:42.790 --> 27:44.560
This one was looking
for Durazo.

27:44.560 --> 27:47.460
I see no one who looks
for <i> Señor</i> Durazo.

27:47.460 --> 27:50.500
Keep your eyes open
from now on, eh?

27:50.500 --> 27:52.000
Oh!

27:53.630 --> 27:56.400
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

28:17.660 --> 28:18.790
Ah.

28:21.960 --> 28:23.460
( gun clicks )

28:23.460 --> 28:25.800
Walker...

28:25.800 --> 28:27.300
Don't tell me...

28:27.300 --> 28:29.370
You need my help again, huh?

28:29.370 --> 28:30.740
I'm afraid so.

28:30.740 --> 28:33.270
Well, it just
so happens,<i> mi amigo,</i>

28:33.270 --> 28:35.570
I am in the mood to give it.

28:35.580 --> 28:37.240
What do you need?

28:37.240 --> 28:39.080
Right here.

28:39.080 --> 28:41.080
Ah, no problem.

28:41.080 --> 28:43.120
Meet me here at midnight.

28:43.120 --> 28:44.980
( country music playing in bar )

28:46.120 --> 28:47.120
ALEX:
I have been trying

28:47.120 --> 28:49.120
to reach Jimmy all day.

28:49.120 --> 28:50.920
The office said
that he called in sick,

28:50.920 --> 28:52.190
but when I tried him
at his house,

28:52.190 --> 28:54.690
all I got was his machine.

28:54.690 --> 28:56.960
I think he went down to Mexico
to help out Walker.

28:56.960 --> 28:58.300
More likely.

28:58.300 --> 28:59.800
We have to do something.

28:59.800 --> 29:03.640
Alex, all you have to do
is order a beer and drink it.

29:03.640 --> 29:04.970
And then what?

29:04.970 --> 29:07.110
When they come back,
they'll tell their story.

29:07.110 --> 29:08.570
But what if--?

29:08.580 --> 29:10.080
My God,
I hate feeling like this.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.510
Alex, just relax.

29:11.510 --> 29:14.510
Cordell's not gonna get anywhere
he can't get out of.

29:14.520 --> 29:17.520
And you sure as hell
can't talk him out of this.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.080
Paco saved his life.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.020
I didn't know that.

29:21.020 --> 29:23.020
Mm-hm.

29:23.020 --> 29:25.360
On their first assignment,
Cordell got wounded.

29:25.360 --> 29:27.260
Paco saved his life.

29:27.260 --> 29:30.060
So he went down there
to return the favor.

29:30.060 --> 29:31.760
It's just that simple.

29:33.800 --> 29:36.270
You want some goobers?

29:36.270 --> 29:38.570
( crickets chirping )

29:44.080 --> 29:45.980

29:45.980 --> 29:47.250

29:53.590 --> 29:55.790
( guards yelling in Spanish )

30:13.610 --> 30:15.610
Okay, we've got three hours.

30:16.940 --> 30:18.440
Let's get ready.

30:22.780 --> 30:25.450
Hey, Durazo's been
looking for you.

30:25.450 --> 30:26.790
So?

30:26.790 --> 30:29.220
So you'd better
see what he wants.

30:29.220 --> 30:30.290
( scoffs )

30:30.290 --> 30:32.120
I know what he wants.

30:35.360 --> 30:36.730
Get away from me, you pig.

30:36.730 --> 30:38.100
Where have you been tonight, eh?

30:38.100 --> 30:39.230
Out.

30:39.230 --> 30:41.400
Out where?

30:41.400 --> 30:44.900
Since when do I have
to report to you?

30:44.900 --> 30:48.510
I'm not your property.
I'm Durazo's girl.

30:48.510 --> 30:49.710
Hm.

30:49.710 --> 30:52.680
I've seen so many
like you come and go.

30:52.680 --> 30:55.150
One day soon, he'll be
bored with you, and then...

30:55.150 --> 30:57.650
Lapping up leftovers
from the floor

30:57.650 --> 30:59.350
like a dog, huh?

31:01.590 --> 31:03.620
Somebody jumped me today.

31:03.620 --> 31:05.490
Knocked me out cold.

31:05.490 --> 31:08.430
Funny thing, as I went down,
I thought maybe--

31:08.430 --> 31:09.430
Maybe what?

31:09.430 --> 31:10.960
DURAZO:
Maria!

31:12.170 --> 31:13.430

What's going on, Walker?
He said he'd be here, right?

31:51.670 --> 31:53.240
Yeah.

31:58.110 --> 31:59.810
Trivette!

32:04.820 --> 32:06.820
He's dead.

32:09.390 --> 32:11.060
Sorry, Vargas.

32:27.710 --> 32:29.710
Got the stuff.

32:29.710 --> 32:31.740
How're we gonna use
this stuff without Vargas?

32:31.750 --> 32:33.480
Our plan requires
three men.

32:33.480 --> 32:35.510
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.120
What?

32:38.120 --> 32:39.620
The watches, man.

32:39.620 --> 32:40.620
What about 'em?

32:43.020 --> 32:46.690
If I can modify the mechanism...

32:46.690 --> 32:48.060
Can I do that?

32:48.060 --> 32:49.830
I don't know. Can you do it?

32:50.800 --> 32:52.700
We're in business, partner.

a little more time.

41:13.670 --> 41:14.670
( beeps )

41:16.940 --> 41:18.300
Let's get out of here.

41:19.170 --> 41:20.170
( beeps )

41:25.580 --> 41:26.580
Wait here.

41:29.350 --> 41:30.350
( beeps )

42:00.950 --> 42:03.750
( guards shouting in Spanish)
( more explosions and gunfire )

42:06.090 --> 42:07.590
( shouting in Spanish )

42:12.560 --> 42:13.690
Hey.
<i> Qué?</i>

42:18.500 --> 42:19.760
<i> Señor. Hola.</i>

42:36.550 --> 42:38.150
( gagging )

42:42.660 --> 42:44.720
(<i> country theme playing</i> )

43:24.060 --> 43:25.060
Look at me.

43:25.730 --> 43:26.830
( grunts )

43:29.440 --> 43:30.670
Just isn't your day.

43:43.280 --> 43:45.820
( panting )

43:47.990 --> 43:49.150
Trivette.

43:49.160 --> 43:51.860
MARIA:
Let me out!
Damn it, let me out!

43:54.830 --> 43:56.830
Get away from the door, Maria.

43:56.830 --> 43:58.160
( gunshot )

44:01.530 --> 44:02.530
You all right?

44:02.540 --> 44:03.970
I'm all right.
You sure?

44:03.970 --> 44:05.270
Yeah, I'm fine.
Let's go.

44:25.860 --> 44:26.860
PACO:
Let him go, Walker.

44:26.860 --> 44:28.090
I'm not finished
with him yet.

44:39.910 --> 44:41.840
Now, I'm finished.

44:43.610 --> 44:45.210
( men speaking in Spanish )

44:51.990 --> 44:53.850
PACO:
Well, I guess we're
even now, huh,<i> amigo?</i>

44:53.850 --> 44:56.650
I saved your life.
Now, you saved mine.

44:56.660 --> 44:58.490
And I'd do it again.

44:58.490 --> 45:00.060
And I as well, my friend.

45:02.230 --> 45:03.460
WALKER:
Take care of yourself.

45:03.460 --> 45:04.630
You too.

45:04.630 --> 45:07.270
The three of us made
a pretty good team, huh?

45:07.270 --> 45:09.570
You bet.
See you around.

45:09.570 --> 45:11.040
You too.

45:17.080 --> 45:18.240
( engine starts )

45:23.020 --> 45:24.850
He's a great guy, Walker.

45:24.850 --> 45:26.920
Yeah, the best.

45:30.020 --> 45:31.960
All right.
So where we park the truck?

45:31.960 --> 45:33.060
I don't know.

45:33.060 --> 45:34.430
It all looks
different at night.

45:35.760 --> 45:37.730
You don't remember?

45:37.730 --> 45:39.500
Well, it's not like
I didn't have other things

45:39.500 --> 45:40.700
on my mind.

45:40.700 --> 45:43.100
Walker, I'm tired.
My feet hurt. You...

45:44.170 --> 45:45.570
Look, the next time
you get yourself

45:45.570 --> 45:46.600
in a situation
like this,

45:46.610 --> 45:47.870
don't expect me
to come down here

45:47.870 --> 45:48.870
and bail your butt out.

45:48.880 --> 45:51.210
I didn't ask you to come.

45:51.210 --> 45:52.540
No, not in so many words,

45:52.550 --> 45:53.680
but you knew I wouldn't let you

45:53.680 --> 45:55.180
come down here by yourself.

45:56.350 --> 45:58.850
Trivette, I specifically
told you not to come.

45:58.850 --> 46:00.450
Yeah, but see,
that's not what you meant.

46:00.450 --> 46:02.950
You wanted me to make
the decision on my own.

46:02.960 --> 46:04.760
Hey!
And another thing.

46:04.760 --> 46:06.760
They didn't approve
my expense account,

46:06.760 --> 46:09.160
so you owe me for
my sheepskin coat.

46:09.160 --> 46:10.660
Six hundred
and forty-eight dollars,

46:10.660 --> 46:13.000
thirty-seven cents, pal.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Can I pay you in pesos?

46:15.000 --> 46:17.340
No, you can't
pay me in pesos!

46:17.340 --> 46:19.800
Where is that dadgum truck?

46:21.240 --> 46:22.470
Walker!

46:22.480 --> 46:24.680
