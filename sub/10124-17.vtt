09:18.800 --> 09:20.700
CHAPTER 12

09:20.700 --> 09:23.100

09:23.100 --> 09:25.367
<i>THE BILL OF RIGHTS. </i>

09:25.367 --> 09:27.567
OH, DEAR.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.033
OHH...

09:29.033 --> 09:30.400
THE BILL OF RIGHTS.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.400
FROM THE GOOD OLD
CONSTITUTION.

09:33.400 --> 09:34.934
WHAT WAS
THAT AMENDMENT

09:34.934 --> 09:36.800
THAT CAME FIRST
IN THE BILL
OF RIGHTS?

09:36.800 --> 09:39.233
I DON'T RECALL,
BUT I BET
OUR TEACHER KNOWS.

09:39.233 --> 09:41.467
THEN WHY
DON'T WE ASK HIM?

09:41.467 --> 09:42.934
OH, MR. FEENY.

09:42.934 --> 09:44.400
FREEDOM OF SPEECH.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.567
HEY, ISN'T THAT THE ONE

09:45.567 --> 09:47.967
WHERE YOU CAN SAY
WHATEVER YOU WANT?

09:47.967 --> 09:49.300
I BELIEVE IT IS.

09:49.300 --> 09:51.700
AND DOESN'T IT APPLY
TO EVERYBODY?

09:51.700 --> 09:53.000
NO.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.867
ANY KIND OF SPEECH, RIGHT?

09:54.867 --> 09:58.700
LIKE IN A NEWSPAPER
OR TV OR...

09:58.700 --> 10:00.100
I DON'T KNOW, RADIO?

10:00.100 --> 10:02.200
YES. YES.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.600
SOMETHING IS NOT
MAKING SENSE HERE.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.033
WEREN'T WE
PULLED OFF THE AIR

10:07.033 --> 10:08.500
BECAUSE OF WHAT WE SAID?

10:08.500 --> 10:09.734
YES, WE WERE.

10:09.734 --> 10:12.567
HE SAYS ONE THING,
THEN HE DOES ANOTHER.

10:12.567 --> 10:14.133
HE'S BEING
A HYPOCHONDRIAC.

10:14.133 --> 10:16.800
WHAT YOU TWO SAID
OVER THE AIRWAVES

10:16.800 --> 10:18.100
WAS INAPPROPRIATE.

10:18.100 --> 10:20.467

10:20.467 --> 10:21.600
UH-UH!

DON'T YOU BELIEVE

10:25.200 --> 10:26.667

YOU TEACH US?

10:26.667 --> 10:29.233
MR. MATTHEWS, THE RIGHTS
OF THE CONSTITUTION

10:29.233 --> 10:30.600
WERE INTENDED FOR THOSE

10:30.600 --> 10:32.700
WITH A SENSE
OF RESPONSIBILITY.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.600
IF IT DOESN'T
APPLY TO US,

10:34.600 --> 10:36.600
WHY DO WE
HAVE TO LEARN IT?

10:44.600 --> 10:47.200
HI, GUYS. I HAVE
TO TELL YOU THIS--

10:47.200 --> 10:48.834
THE GIRLS
IN FIFTH PERIOD GYM

10:48.834 --> 10:51.367
WERE TALKING
ABOUT YOUR SHOW
IN THE LOCKER ROOM.

10:51.367 --> 10:53.867
GIRLS WERE TALKING
ABOUT US

10:53.867 --> 10:55.233
IN THE GIRLS'
LOCKER ROOM?

10:55.233 --> 10:57.233
TELL ME--
WERE THE SHOWERS ON?

10:57.233 --> 10:59.600
WHEN ARE YOU GOING
TO BE ON AGAIN?

10:59.600 --> 11:01.600
REAL, REAL SOON.

11:03.233 --> 11:07.100
WE GOT TO GET BACK
ON THE AIR. HOW?

11:07.100 --> 11:09.667
I'M THINKING.
I'M THINKING.

11:09.667 --> 11:10.734
I GOT IT!

11:10.734 --> 11:11.767
WHAT?

11:11.767 --> 11:14.100
WE GOT TO GET BACK
ON THE AIR.

11:14.100 --> 11:15.500
YOU'RE A GENIUS.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.300
THAT'S WHY WE MAKE
SUCH A GOOD TEAM.

11:18.300 --> 11:19.600
HEY, MR. TURNER.

11:19.600 --> 11:20.900
I DON'T KNOW YOU.

11:20.900 --> 11:21.967
WHAT'D WE DO?

11:21.967 --> 11:23.800
YOU UPSET
THE GUY IN CHARGE.

11:23.800 --> 11:26.667
YOU KNOW FEENY.
HE GAVE YOU
RESPONSIBILITY,

11:26.667 --> 11:28.700
AND YOU ABUSED IT.
YOU'RE GONE.

11:28.700 --> 11:30.667
BUT YOU'RE
THE FACULTY ADVISOR.

11:30.667 --> 11:33.100
YOU CAN PUT US
ON AGAIN.

11:33.100 --> 11:35.467
WHY SHOULD I STICK
MY NECK OUT FOR YOU?

11:35.467 --> 11:37.734
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE YOUNG
DEDICATED TEACHER

11:37.734 --> 11:39.767
WHO BELIEVES THAT KIDS
DESERVE A SECOND CHANCE.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.133
THAT'S ME?

11:41.133 --> 11:42.400
YEAH. YOU DIDN'T KNOW?

11:42.400 --> 11:45.133
THE ONLY WAY YOU
GET BACK ON THE AIR

11:45.133 --> 11:46.100
IS IF I TALK TO FEENY.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.000
LIKE YOU CAN TALK
TO FEENY.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.100
HE DOESN'T THINK STRAIGHT,
MR. TURNER.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.200
HE DOESN'T EVEN BELIEVE
IN THE CONSTITUTION.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.734
YEAH. HE
TOTALLY IGNORES

11:53.734 --> 11:54.600
THE FIRST
COMMANDMENT.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.300
GUYS,
JUST CHILL OUT, O.K.?

11:57.300 --> 11:59.200
IT CAN'T HAPPEN
WITHOUT FEENY.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.600
PROMISE ME
YOU'LL STAY AWAY

12:00.600 --> 12:02.467
FROM THE RADIO STATION,
O.K.?

12:02.467 --> 12:03.567
O.K.
O.K.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.600
LIKE TALKING TO FEENY'S
GOING TO HELP.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.867
HE'S JUST NOT GOING
TO LISTEN TO ANYBODY.

12:08.867 --> 12:10.367
HE'S INSANE.

12:10.367 --> 12:13.467
IF WE'RE GOING
TO GET BACK
ON THE RADIO,

12:13.467 --> 12:15.500
WE'LL HAVE TO DO IT
BY OURSELVES.

12:15.500 --> 12:16.500
I AGREE.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.567
BUT WE'LL NEED
LOTS OF HELP.

12:18.567 --> 12:19.834
ALVIN!

12:21.367 --> 12:22.900
TELL ME SOMETHING, ALVIN.

12:22.900 --> 12:26.233
YOU BASICALLY PUT
THAT RADIO STATION
TOGETHER, RIGHT?

12:26.233 --> 12:27.500
IT'S MY BABY.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.934
WELL, POP, LET'S GO SEE
HOW JUNIOR'S DOING.

12:35.567 --> 12:38.400
WHY ARE WE GETTING

12:39.400 --> 12:40.900

"ERIC MATTHEWS."

12:40.900 --> 12:43.767
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR IT.
FINALLY IT'S HERE.

12:43.767 --> 12:45.233
WHAT ELSE WE GOT?

12:45.233 --> 12:46.700
<i>BOTSWANA TODAY. </i>

12:46.700 --> 12:49.600

WHERE I WANT THEM.

12:49.600 --> 12:50.967
WHAT GUYS, ERIC?

12:50.967 --> 12:54.400
ROBIN LEACH AND THE GUYS
THAT'LL HAND ME $10 MILLION.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.500
OH, THIS IS YOUR
MAGAZINE SCAM.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.100
NO, NO, IT'S A SYSTEM.

12:58.100 --> 13:00.800
I ORDERED A MAGAZINE
FOR EVERY LETTER
OF THE ALPHABET,

13:00.800 --> 13:03.233
SO WHEN THE COMPUTER
SCANS FOR A WINNER,

13:03.233 --> 13:04.900
IT CAN'T POSSIBLY MISS ME.

DIFFERENT THAN THAT

OFF THE AIR.

13:44.367 --> 13:46.800

17:43.233 --> 17:44.000
SAVE IT.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.734
WE HAD A DEAL, BOYS.

17:46.734 --> 17:48.233
WHY
WAS IT SO IMPORTANT

17:48.233 --> 17:50.200
TO GET
BACK ON THE AIR

17:50.200 --> 17:52.033
THAT YOU
WOULD SHAFT ME?

17:52.033 --> 17:53.300
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

17:53.300 --> 17:54.934
WELL,
PRETEND I'M STUPID.

17:59.734 --> 18:02.500
WE...

18:02.500 --> 18:05.400
WENT...

18:05.400 --> 18:06.600
ON...

18:06.600 --> 18:09.033
THE RADIO.

18:11.367 --> 18:13.233
PRETEND I'M SMARTER.

18:13.233 --> 18:15.100
LOOK, MR. TURNER,

18:15.100 --> 18:17.600
WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO FIND OUR PLACE.

18:17.600 --> 18:18.934
WE'RE
ONLY SEVENTH GRADERS.

18:18.934 --> 18:21.467
BUT YOU'RE STUDENTS.
ISN'T THAT ENOUGH?

18:21.467 --> 18:23.000
YOU REMEMBER
WHAT IT'S LIKE.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.600
<i>EVERYBODY ELSE SEEMS </i>
<i>TO KNOW WHO THEY ARE, </i>

18:25.600 --> 18:27.467
<i>WHERE THEY BELONG, </i>

18:27.467 --> 18:30.033
<i>BUT...WE'RE NOBODY. </i>

18:30.033 --> 18:33.233
<i>YOU THOUGHT </i>
<i>BEING ON RADIO </i>
<i>WOULD HELP YOU? </i>

18:33.233 --> 18:36.100
IF WE'RE ON THE RADIO AND
EVERYONE THINKS WE'RE COOL,

18:36.100 --> 18:38.567
THEN WE DON'T GET
LOST IN THE SHUFFLE.

18:38.567 --> 18:40.000
YOU FEEL LOST?

18:41.700 --> 18:43.367
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

18:45.667 --> 18:48.300
YEAH. SOMETIMES.

18:48.300 --> 18:51.567
I BET
A LOT OF PEOPLE
FEEL THAT WAY.

18:51.567 --> 18:54.500
YEAH, BUT THEY DON'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.800
WELL,
I'M SURE THEY DO.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.600
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

18:58.600 --> 19:00.900
LOOK AT ALL
THE CALLS WE HAVE.

19:02.900 --> 19:04.900
WE'RE ON THE AIR?

19:04.900 --> 19:07.867
SOMEONE MUST HAVE
TURNED ON THE SWITCH
ACCIDENTALLY.

19:07.867 --> 19:09.700
THEY HEARD ALL OF THAT?

19:09.700 --> 19:12.300
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DO "LUNCHTIME LUST"

19:12.300 --> 19:13.467
TO GET AN AUDIENCE.

19:13.467 --> 19:16.100
JUST BE HONEST.

20:05.567 --> 20:08.400
A LOT WORSE COULD
HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU.

20:08.400 --> 20:09.667
THAT IS THEM, FATHER--

20:09.667 --> 20:12.300
