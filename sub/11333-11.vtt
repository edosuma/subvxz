WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:03.086
Previously on 90210:

00:03.128 --> 00:05.422
I will be going
to California University.

00:05.464 --> 00:07.090
CU isn't going to happen.

00:07.132 --> 00:08.383
So you're going to focus
on the S.A.T.s?

00:08.425 --> 00:10.260
Yeah... no, I'm gonna date
the dean's son.

00:10.302 --> 00:12.179
Are you Richard?
Naomi.

00:12.220 --> 00:13.514
I'm Jamie, by the way.

00:13.555 --> 00:14.598
Hey, there you are.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.892
Jamie, this is...
My roommate Richard.

00:16.934 --> 00:19.102
I wish you weren't dating
Richard because I...

00:19.144 --> 00:20.562
I really want to kiss you.

00:20.604 --> 00:22.105
You can go home, Marilyn.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.565
My date's arrived.

00:25.275 --> 00:26.861
I want the same stuff
I got last time.

00:30.614 --> 00:33.367
Navid Shirazi told me that
you were a drug dealer.
What?

00:33.408 --> 00:35.410
I am not a drug dealer,
but if I was,

00:35.452 --> 00:37.037
I wouldn't be
the kind of guy

00:37.078 --> 00:38.873
you want to mess
with, would I?

00:38.914 --> 00:40.290
Jasper?
Yeah?
I love you.

00:40.332 --> 00:42.960
And I want my first
time to be with you.

00:43.002 --> 00:44.586
Mom, time to wake up.

00:44.628 --> 00:45.587
Mom?!

00:45.629 --> 00:46.630
Mom?!

00:46.672 --> 00:48.590
Uh, yeah, I need an ambulance.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.598
What do we have?
60-year-old
female found unconscious

00:56.640 --> 00:57.641
in her home.

00:57.683 --> 00:59.727
Status-- post
cardiac arrest.

00:59.768 --> 01:00.728
BP's 110/70.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.145
Medications?
We gave her

01:02.187 --> 01:03.522
one milligram
of epinephrine.

01:03.564 --> 01:04.857
She's on Bactrim
and gabapentin.

01:04.899 --> 01:06.107
Where are you taking her?!

01:06.149 --> 01:07.651
I need you to wait
in the lobby.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.570
We'll find you
when there's news.

01:09.611 --> 01:10.905
(gasping)

01:15.701 --> 01:16.660
Navid!

01:16.702 --> 01:18.662
Oh, hey, I was texting you.

01:18.704 --> 01:20.288
Oh, good. Well, me first.

01:20.330 --> 01:23.000
I am here to rescue your little
news broadcast thingy.

01:23.042 --> 01:24.501
I'm going to join.

01:24.543 --> 01:25.335
Naomi...

01:25.377 --> 01:27.170
Come on, I just want
to pad my resume

01:27.212 --> 01:28.338
with some
extracurriculars, okay?

01:28.380 --> 01:29.673
No, you're just going to flake

01:29.715 --> 01:31.216
whenever there's any
actual work to do.

01:31.258 --> 01:32.509
Now, look...
Please, Navid,

01:32.551 --> 01:33.886
I really have to get into CU.

01:33.928 --> 01:35.178
Please, please,
please, please.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.597
Pretty, pretty,
pretty please.

01:36.638 --> 01:37.932
I'm going to keep begging until
you say yes. Please, please...

01:37.973 --> 01:39.391
Okay, all right,
all right, fine.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.393
Yay. Okay, I know exactly what
my segment's going to be called.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.187
You're not getting a segment.
Clark After Dark.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.481
I'll give people sex advice.

01:46.523 --> 01:47.942
No.

01:47.983 --> 01:49.777
Okay, listen, I'm
getting a bunch

01:49.818 --> 01:51.028
of new high-def
video mixers,

01:51.070 --> 01:52.696
and you can help
me unpack those.

01:52.738 --> 01:54.239
Ex-squeeze me?

01:54.281 --> 01:56.283
Well, if you're serious
about the Blaze,

01:56.324 --> 01:57.701
you can meet me here
tomorrow by 6:00.

01:57.743 --> 01:58.869
Uh, can I talk now?

01:58.911 --> 02:00.245
Mm.

02:00.287 --> 02:04.792
I have something, um...
very important to tell you.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.501
This better not be
some lame hazing ritual.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.711
No, it's about Adrianna.

02:08.753 --> 02:10.464
I think she's
back on drugs.

02:13.092 --> 02:14.217
What?

02:14.259 --> 02:16.219
Of course I'm not on drugs.

02:16.261 --> 02:20.015
Okay, I've been clean for
so long, you know that.

02:20.057 --> 02:21.391
Okay.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.226
Why would Navid say it
if it weren't true?

02:23.268 --> 02:24.561
I don't know.

02:24.603 --> 02:27.439
You know, things have been
pretty bad with us lately.

02:27.481 --> 02:30.567
Maybe he's mad because
I've moved on since the breakup.

02:30.609 --> 02:33.988
You have to believe me,
I'm clean.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.572
Look, Ade,

02:35.614 --> 02:38.075
I want to believe you,
I really do,

02:38.117 --> 02:41.244
but you've lied to me
about this before.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.956
Yeah, well, I'm not lying now.

02:45.624 --> 02:49.294
Okay, do you remember what
I was like when I was on coke?

02:50.629 --> 02:52.798
Am I acting anything
like that right now?

02:55.134 --> 02:57.886
No... you're not.

02:57.928 --> 02:58.971
Exactly.

02:59.013 --> 03:00.514
Okay, I'm going
to talk to Navid

03:00.555 --> 03:02.724
and I'm going to get
to the bottom of it.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.351
Okay?

03:14.444 --> 03:15.946
How is she? Is she okay?

03:15.988 --> 03:18.991
I don't... I don't know,
I don't know.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.909
When I... when I
woke up this morning,

03:20.951 --> 03:22.243
she wasn't breathing,

03:22.285 --> 03:23.453
so I called 911.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.122
They said that she was
in cardiac arrest.

03:25.164 --> 03:26.540
But they gave her CPR

03:26.581 --> 03:28.249
and her heart started beating
again in the ambulance,

03:28.291 --> 03:30.127
but she's been in there
for over an hour.

03:30.169 --> 03:32.295
Hey, hey, everything's
going to be okay.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.714
No, it's not!

03:33.755 --> 03:35.423
You don't know how
sick she's been.

03:36.675 --> 03:40.470
Look, I know that
she has cancer, but...

03:40.512 --> 03:42.389
it... it wasn't supposed
to happen like this.

03:42.430 --> 03:43.640
Okay.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.809
DOCTOR: Thank you
for being so patient.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.769
Are you a relative?

03:47.811 --> 03:50.522
Yeah. We're her daughters.

03:50.564 --> 03:53.483
Well, your mother suffered
a cardiac arrest.

03:53.525 --> 03:54.818
And I afraid with
the chemotherapy treatments,

03:54.860 --> 03:56.111
she's...

03:56.153 --> 03:58.989
she's too weak
to fight much longer.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.827
She's conscious now. It would be
a good time to see her.

04:15.214 --> 04:16.380
Aren't you coming?

04:18.341 --> 04:20.135
No, I can't.

04:20.177 --> 04:21.011
Kelly...

04:21.053 --> 04:22.512
Just go.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.305
I'm sure she'll be happy
to see you.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.682
DOCTOR:
Is anybody coming?

04:25.724 --> 04:28.936
Yeah, I am.

04:36.693 --> 04:37.861
"...remedy for..."
Plural.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.529
So that'd be plural then?
Yeah, I think so.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.031
Morning, Dixon.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.490
I'm getting a ride
from Liam.

04:42.532 --> 04:45.326
Do you want any breakfast?

04:45.368 --> 04:47.454
Hey, he'll get over
it sooner or later.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.289
Morning.

04:49.330 --> 04:50.373
Morning.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.875
Well, you're
in a good mood.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.627
Things are good.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.045
Well, can we get
some details?

04:55.087 --> 04:56.379
Dirty deets, as
the kids say?

04:56.421 --> 04:57.881
Seriously, Dad?

04:57.923 --> 05:00.508
Regular details
would be just fine.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.552
Well, actually, I've kind
of been seeing someone.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.345
Who's the lucky guy?

05:04.387 --> 05:05.639
His name is Jasper.

05:05.680 --> 05:06.974
Go to West Bev?

05:07.015 --> 05:08.058
Yes.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.226
What's he like?

05:09.268 --> 05:10.560
He's amazing.

05:10.602 --> 05:11.728
Um, he's a filmmaker,

05:11.770 --> 05:14.564
but more like a genius.

05:14.606 --> 05:17.234
I will check his transcripts
just to be sure.

05:17.276 --> 05:19.319
So can we meet
him sometime?

05:19.360 --> 05:21.655
Yeah. Um, actually, I was hoping

05:21.696 --> 05:23.865
that maybe he could
come over for dinner?

05:23.907 --> 05:25.659
Sure. That's a great idea.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.161
How about tomorrow night?

05:27.202 --> 05:28.453
Perfect.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.746
HARRY: Shouldn't you be
getting to school?

05:29.788 --> 05:31.248
First period.
study hall.

05:31.290 --> 05:33.167
It's Friday, remember?

05:33.208 --> 05:34.668
Dirty deets?

05:34.709 --> 05:36.335
That's what they
say, you know?

05:36.377 --> 05:38.088
I can't believe
she's seeing someone.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.757
I can't believe she's
actually telling us about it.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.929
How did it go?

05:45.971 --> 05:47.346
Shh.

05:47.388 --> 05:49.224
You're coming over
tomorrow night.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.519
(knocking on door)

05:56.815 --> 05:59.358
Um, hey, do you think Jasper
would like chicken tarragon

05:59.400 --> 06:00.694
or mahi mahi for dinner?

06:00.735 --> 06:03.571
Uh, mahi mahi.
You got it.

06:03.613 --> 06:04.739
I can't wait to meet him.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.033
Yeah.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.117
Okay.

06:07.159 --> 06:10.037
Mahi mahi, eh?
Shh.

06:10.078 --> 06:12.747
Look, should I come in
through the window for dinner,

06:12.789 --> 06:14.582
or should I use the front door?

06:35.187 --> 06:39.566
Hey, um, Ivy's mom has
a recording studio, right?

06:39.607 --> 06:42.986
Oh, are you finally gonna make
an album as DJ Mr. Big Dix?

06:43.028 --> 06:44.279
(laughing)

06:44.321 --> 06:45.655
No, dude, it's D-I-X.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.199
Anyway, all right,

06:47.241 --> 06:49.159
what I was trying to say

06:49.201 --> 06:51.536
was maybe we could use
that studio to, uh,

06:51.578 --> 06:53.496
bring down Naomi's sister.

06:53.538 --> 06:54.539
Hmm?

06:54.581 --> 06:55.707
Okay.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.000
Well, all right, look,

06:57.042 --> 06:59.418
all we have to do is
get Ivy to say exactly

06:59.460 --> 07:02.630
what Jen said in that recording
that you deleted, right?

07:02.672 --> 07:05.800
Mix it down so it
sounds like Jen--

07:05.842 --> 07:09.137
boom, and let Naomi hear it.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.764
Okay, look, I know
you're just trying

07:10.805 --> 07:12.766
to help and everything,
but, dude...

07:12.807 --> 07:15.185
Mix it down a little bit
so it sounds like... Jen.

07:15.227 --> 07:16.186
What's up?

07:16.228 --> 07:17.478
You guys figure
anything out yet?

07:17.520 --> 07:20.399
Oh, we figured out
DJ Mr. Big Dix is a big moron.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.402
Hey, dude, you're the one
who deleted the recording
in the first place.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.321
Well, that would make you both
morons then, wouldn't it?

07:26.363 --> 07:28.323
DJ Mr. Big Dix? Really?
No, it's...

07:28.365 --> 07:30.575
I have a better idea.
How about you guys
come by the media lab

07:30.617 --> 07:32.077
and help me unpack
some video mixers?

07:32.119 --> 07:33.412
IVY:
Oh, dude.
Yay.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.913
Dinner on me.
Anytime, anywhere.

07:34.955 --> 07:35.914
Including and limited to

07:35.956 --> 07:38.458
In-N-Out Burger.
What do you say?

07:38.499 --> 07:40.085
LIAM: Fine.
IVY: Sure.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.002
Hey, Dixon, you in?

07:43.463 --> 07:44.672
DIXON:
I don't know, man.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.674
She's been spending a lot
of time with that freak.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.593
Yeah, I'd keep an eye
on him, man.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.470
I saw that dude
dealing drugs.

07:54.433 --> 07:56.435
Let's go.

07:56.476 --> 08:00.355
(sultry voice): Hello, and
welcome to Clark After Dark.

08:00.397 --> 08:03.024
Today we're here to talk
about all the best ways

08:03.066 --> 08:05.902
to make a woman reach ecstasy.

08:05.944 --> 08:08.529
Oh, we have our first caller.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.240
Hello. You're on with Naomi.

08:10.282 --> 08:11.783
Hi. I need some advice.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.160
You see, I'm dating

08:13.201 --> 08:14.702
this wonderful girl,

08:14.744 --> 08:15.870
and I just...

08:15.912 --> 08:18.999
I want to do filthy,
terrible things to her.

08:19.040 --> 08:23.420
What exactly did
you have in mind?

08:23.462 --> 08:24.796
Hi.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.759
(phone vibrating)

08:29.801 --> 08:31.594
Oh.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.513
Oh, my new boss at the Blaze.

08:33.554 --> 08:34.722
Ignore.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.599
Why is he calling you
on the weekend?

08:36.640 --> 08:38.726
Because I have to go
there tomorrow at 6:00

08:38.768 --> 08:39.936
and unpack some crap.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.438
I think Katie Couric got her
start unpacking crap.

08:41.480 --> 08:42.481
Oh, ha-ha.
Hey.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.569
Um, I thought you were going
to your parents' house.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.571
I just forgot my laptop.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.240
Hello, Jamie.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.242
Hey, hey, Dean Carter.

08:54.284 --> 08:55.994
This is
Richard's mom.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.662
This is Naomi Clark.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.373
The girl who was
supposed to be

08:59.414 --> 09:01.916
Richard's date
for my cocktail party.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.126
Um, kind of.

09:03.168 --> 09:04.585
And now you're
with Jamie.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.171
Classy.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.507
Can we go now?

09:16.806 --> 09:20.768
So after the Bonhams
and Butterfields auction

09:20.810 --> 09:22.187
we have a table
at Entitlement.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.897
Is that another night club?

09:23.938 --> 09:26.441
The name's ironic,
obviously.

09:26.483 --> 09:29.110
We'll be sitting with a
South American coffee magnate,

09:29.152 --> 09:31.321
Manuel Fonseca Veloso de...

09:31.363 --> 09:33.323
You don't speak
Portuguese, do you?

09:33.365 --> 09:34.615
Uh, no.

09:34.657 --> 09:35.867
"Nao."

09:35.909 --> 09:38.578
And tomorrow night is
the benefit concert...

09:38.619 --> 09:40.205
Yeah, who does that benefit,
again?

09:40.247 --> 09:41.456
I forget.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.500
Either a village in Africa

09:43.542 --> 09:44.751
or a degenerative
spine disease.

09:44.792 --> 09:45.877
(sighs)

09:45.919 --> 09:48.046
Is something wrong?

09:48.088 --> 09:50.673
Uh, no, everything
is, uh, fine.

09:50.715 --> 09:53.760
I'm looking forward to...
all of it.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.136
But?

09:55.178 --> 09:57.472
It's just that, uh,

09:57.514 --> 09:59.807
we've been spending
a lot of time in your world

09:59.849 --> 10:02.810
and it's been fun, you know,
but I just someday would like

10:02.852 --> 10:04.438
to show you my world.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.606
Right. I'm a
West Beverly alumni.

10:06.647 --> 10:08.066
I know everything
about your world.

10:08.108 --> 10:11.027
I was thinking more along
the lines of planning a weekend.

10:11.069 --> 10:12.404
Maybe even this one.

10:12.446 --> 10:16.032
What exactly do
you have in mind?

10:16.074 --> 10:17.784
What about camping?

10:17.825 --> 10:19.702
You know, we could
go up to Los Padres

10:19.744 --> 10:21.288
and we could do
a little hiking

10:21.329 --> 10:22.872
and we could sleep out
under the stars.

10:22.914 --> 10:25.125
You know, enjoy the peace
and the quiet and each other.

10:25.166 --> 10:28.044
Well, it does sound romantic.

10:31.923 --> 10:34.384
I'd love to.

10:34.426 --> 10:35.718
Really?
Really.

10:37.345 --> 10:40.432
Yeah, it sounds, um, great.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.402
What's the matter, babe?

10:52.444 --> 10:55.780
Forget it. Just go back
to your carbo loading.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.865
Naomi, what's wrong?

10:57.907 --> 11:01.328
You said Richard
wouldn't be here.

11:01.369 --> 11:02.870
Are you still caught up on that?

11:02.912 --> 11:03.997
He knows that we're dating.

11:04.038 --> 11:05.873
We-we can't avoid him forever.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.875
It's not Richard
I care about.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.461
(chuckles):
Then who? His mom?

11:09.503 --> 11:12.088
I just can't believe you didn't
tell me they were coming.

11:12.130 --> 11:13.340
I didn't know they were coming.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.175
And why-why do you care
what she thinks, anyway?

11:15.216 --> 11:17.969
I don't.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.387
What do you think
she thinks?

11:19.429 --> 11:21.097
(laughs):
Mm, I don't know.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.098
She probably hates you.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.225
Well, great.
That's awesome.

11:24.267 --> 11:27.354
Why is this such a big deal?

11:27.395 --> 11:28.813
You didn't even
like Richard anyway.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.440
She's the freaking dean
of admissions, Jamie.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.573
Is that... is that why
you were dating Richard?

11:38.615 --> 11:39.949
To get to his-his mom?

11:39.991 --> 11:40.783
Of course not.

11:40.825 --> 11:43.161
Then why were you dating him?

11:45.913 --> 11:48.916
Wait, so you were
just using him?

11:50.210 --> 11:51.710
Naomi, how could you
treat someone like that?

11:51.752 --> 11:52.795
Oh, like you're so noble.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.381
You stole me away
from your own roommate.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.757
Uh, at least that was based on
something honest.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.176
Look, Jamie, I'm sorry.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.554
I just wanted to give myself

12:00.595 --> 12:03.014
the best possible shot
of getting into this school.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.433
Because my dream was

12:05.475 --> 12:07.101
to always meet
someone like you.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.521
And now I have.

12:09.563 --> 12:12.273
I realize I made a mistake.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.153
Can we just move on?

12:17.195 --> 12:18.488
Please?

12:18.530 --> 12:20.948
I don't... I don't think
you even get it, do you?

12:21.908 --> 12:22.867
Richard has been

12:22.909 --> 12:23.993
beating himself up for weeks,

12:24.035 --> 12:25.662
wondering what he did
to screw things up

12:25.704 --> 12:27.163
with you.

12:27.205 --> 12:28.873
You're a user.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.212
And I don't want
to see you anymore.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.800
This week on the Blaze,

12:39.842 --> 12:42.596
we'll have an exclusive
interview with Mr. Lichtenstein

12:42.637 --> 12:45.724
about his lifelong battle
with hypoglycemia.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.184
God, even I'm bored

12:48.226 --> 12:50.186
by that promo.
(chuckles)

12:50.228 --> 12:52.146
Maybe I should let
Naomi do the sex show.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.022
What?

12:53.064 --> 12:53.981
No, I mean...

12:54.023 --> 12:55.567
Why did you tell Naomi
I was using?

12:56.651 --> 12:59.112
Um, I'm gonna go away from here.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.741
I saw you, Ade.

13:02.781 --> 13:04.743
I saw you buying
drugs from Jasper.

13:04.783 --> 13:06.119
I wasn't buying drugs.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.454
Then what was he
doing walking out of

13:07.495 --> 13:08.622
your car with
a wad of cash?

13:08.663 --> 13:09.748
Navid, why are you doing this?

13:09.788 --> 13:10.915
Because I care about you.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.917
Okay, well, I'm not using.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.628
No, you clearly are.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.254
When we broke up, you
were totally devastated.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.298
You were sleeping in
all day, crying,

13:18.339 --> 13:19.716
uh, singing me
love songs.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.342
And then I see you
walking around school

13:21.384 --> 13:22.801
with the girls
and you're perfectly fine?

13:22.843 --> 13:24.053
Yeah, I am.

13:24.095 --> 13:26.264
You know why?

13:26.306 --> 13:29.850
Because you really weren't
that hard to get over.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.227
I'm sorry, but it's true.

13:31.269 --> 13:33.730
The more I thought
about things,

13:33.772 --> 13:35.565
the more I realized that we were

13:35.607 --> 13:38.526
only together
because I needed you.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.487
And that's not love.

13:40.528 --> 13:44.031
So, yeah, I do feel
completely different.

13:44.073 --> 13:48.369
It has nothing to do with drugs.

13:48.411 --> 13:51.289
I guess I was never
really in love with you.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.638
Wow, what is all this?

14:06.680 --> 14:08.515
I stopped at the
Beverly Center

14:08.556 --> 14:10.057
for some wilderness
accoutrements.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.226
Oh, be warned though,
I bought a knife

14:12.268 --> 14:15.146
so powerful that I could
butterfly you in 15 minutes.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.481
Interesting.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.274
Oh, that is an
air mattress.

14:18.316 --> 14:20.735
King size when inflated.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.320
But don't worry,
I bought a pump.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.780
What else do you have in here?

14:23.822 --> 14:26.491
Oh, just a few, you
know, small necessities:

14:26.533 --> 14:27.492
a portable GPS,

14:27.534 --> 14:28.909
a Burberry
raincoat, a...

14:28.951 --> 14:31.329
Jen, Jen, we can't bring
all this stuff.

14:31.371 --> 14:34.582
All right, the beauty of camping
is that we don't need much.

14:34.624 --> 14:36.083
All right? Listen,

14:36.125 --> 14:37.460
you don't have to worry,

14:37.502 --> 14:39.003
'cause you're gonna
be comfortable. Trust me.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.880
Well, what about
the fondue set?

14:40.921 --> 14:42.841
I think we can
manage without it.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.301
Do you want to help me
bring this stuff inside?

14:53.393 --> 14:55.729
(door closes)

14:55.770 --> 14:57.647
Morning.

15:00.107 --> 15:01.067
Hey.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.402
Just the way
you like it.

15:02.443 --> 15:03.986
No cream, no sugar.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.488
Ah, thank you.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.991
(sighs)

15:09.033 --> 15:10.076
Thank you for
everything.

15:10.117 --> 15:12.537
For staying late
at the hospital

15:12.579 --> 15:14.247
and driving
me home.

15:14.288 --> 15:15.790
I'm glad you decided
to stay here.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.334
Are you hungry?

15:18.376 --> 15:20.920
You want me to make you
some eggs or something?

15:20.961 --> 15:23.423
You always take such
good care of me, Kelly.

15:24.465 --> 15:27.260
Sometimes I...

15:27.301 --> 15:29.262
I worry that no one's
looking after you.

15:29.303 --> 15:32.849
Oh, I can take care of myself.

15:32.891 --> 15:34.267
See? One cream, two sugars.

15:34.308 --> 15:36.895
Just the way I like it.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.856
I really think that
you should go see Mom.

15:39.898 --> 15:42.108
You're gonna regret it if
you don't say good-bye.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.360
Silver, no.

15:44.402 --> 15:46.529
Mom and I really don't have
a relationship anymore.

15:46.571 --> 15:47.697
And I'm okay with that.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.323
That's what I used
to think, too.

15:49.365 --> 15:53.369
I can't tell you how much better
I felt since we reconnected.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.663
And I'm glad you did.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.750
But it's different
with her and me.

15:58.792 --> 15:59.959
How is it different?

16:00.000 --> 16:02.128
Um, because I have

16:02.169 --> 16:04.881
20 more years
of bad memories than you.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.257
And I'm not talking about

16:06.299 --> 16:08.468
just, you know,
your run-of-the-mill,

16:08.509 --> 16:09.969
falling down drunk memories.

16:10.010 --> 16:12.305
I'm talking about a lifetime
of never being good enough.

16:12.346 --> 16:13.807
She's different now.

16:13.848 --> 16:14.974
I mean, she's sober.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.601
(chuckles)
Well, her sober

16:16.643 --> 16:17.894
wasn't much better for me.

16:17.936 --> 16:19.938
When she was sober,
she'd remember to give me

16:19.979 --> 16:24.317
my diet pills
and make my nose job appointment

16:24.358 --> 16:26.569
and remind me of what a colossal
disappointment I was.

16:26.611 --> 16:28.279
So you know what?

16:28.321 --> 16:29.948
I got the message,
loud and clear.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.619
Kelly, you have to forgive her.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.121
For your own sake.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.666
No, I don't.

16:39.707 --> 16:42.418
Look, I'm happy to

16:42.460 --> 16:45.087
pick you up at the hospital,
drop you off, whatever you need.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.673
But that's it.

17:06.859 --> 17:10.029
Um, Jamie's at
football practice.

17:10.069 --> 17:12.071
I came to see you.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.534
Can I come in?

17:27.588 --> 17:30.758
I need to apologize to you.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.092
For a lot.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.135
It's fine.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.637
You liked Jamie more;
it happens.

17:36.430 --> 17:37.640
I was just surprised, you know?

17:37.682 --> 17:39.350
I thought you and I
were really connecting.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.020
Richard, I was dishonest
with you from the start.

17:43.521 --> 17:47.483
I'm not really into
the whole environment thing.

17:47.525 --> 17:49.527
Watching that movie
on industrial meat production

17:49.569 --> 17:51.445
just gave me
a craving for Kobe sliders.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.366
Why didn't you say something?

17:55.408 --> 17:59.746
Because... I wanted to date you.

18:02.749 --> 18:07.587
But... the whole reason
I wanted to date you,

18:07.628 --> 18:12.383
the reason I hired you
as my tutor even,

18:12.425 --> 18:15.386
was so I could meet your mom.

18:17.555 --> 18:19.432
I'm sorry, what?

18:19.473 --> 18:21.684
I've always wanted to go to CU.

18:21.726 --> 18:23.686
And I guess I thought
if I dated the dean's son,

18:23.728 --> 18:25.021
then that would guarantee
that I'd get in.

18:25.063 --> 18:27.023
I-I'm really sorry.

18:27.065 --> 18:28.900
I realize how awful that is.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.526
What were you, um,

18:30.568 --> 18:31.819
planning to do?

18:31.861 --> 18:35.364
Just lead me on until
you got your acceptance letter?

18:35.406 --> 18:37.241
I would take it all back
if I could.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.158
Stop.

18:39.285 --> 18:42.413
Just... stop.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.461
ANNIE:
Okay.

18:48.502 --> 18:51.089
Uh, so, Dad, you are not gonna

18:51.130 --> 18:53.091
tell any stupid jokes
during dinner.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.926
When you say "stupid," you
mean "hilarious," right?

18:54.968 --> 18:56.260
I mean, no telling Jasper

18:56.302 --> 18:57.804
you're gonna check
his transcript or whatever.

18:57.845 --> 18:59.055
Ah, don't worry.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.264
I already
checked it.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.892
Okay, crudités
and my famous dip.

19:02.934 --> 19:04.602
So, you guys know that,
you know,

19:04.644 --> 19:06.353
Jasper's the one
wanting to set all this up.

19:06.395 --> 19:08.106
He's been wanting
to meet you guys real bad.

19:08.188 --> 19:09.899
Hmm, you may have
mentioned that once or twice.

19:09.941 --> 19:11.400
Yeah, and you're gonna love him.

19:11.442 --> 19:14.487
He's so sweet and sensitive,
you know, not like all those

19:14.528 --> 19:16.405
typical high school boys.

19:16.447 --> 19:17.615
Well, we look forward
to meeting him.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.785
Hey, is that what
you're wearing to dinner?

19:20.827 --> 19:22.036
No, this is what I'm wearing

19:22.078 --> 19:23.955
to help Navid move
some stuff into the Blaze.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.957
Can that wait
until later?

19:25.999 --> 19:27.000
I was hoping you
could join us.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.709
This dinner's important
to your sister.

19:28.751 --> 19:29.627
(scoffs)

19:29.669 --> 19:31.462
What's your problem?

19:31.504 --> 19:33.297
Nothing. I just don't
want to have dinner

19:33.339 --> 19:34.674
with your weirdo boyfriend.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.884
Yeah, well, at least he's not
some 40-year-old psycho.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.636
Well, at least Sasha
wasn't a drug dealer.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.472
Jasper is not a drug dealer!

19:41.514 --> 19:42.723
Well, that's what Navid told me.

19:42.765 --> 19:44.475
ANNIE:
No, look, Navid doesn't know

19:44.517 --> 19:46.560
what he's talking
about, okay?

19:46.602 --> 19:49.063
(doorbell rings)

19:54.276 --> 19:56.070
Enjoy your dinner.

19:56.112 --> 19:58.280
Hey, Dixon.

20:02.242 --> 20:05.454
Um, Mom, Dad,
this is Jasper.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.803
Isn't it nice to get out of
Beverly Hills for a change?

20:20.845 --> 20:23.430
Mm, I'm just glad your
idea of roughing it

20:23.472 --> 20:26.059
includes a bottle
of Pinot Grigio.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.019
What'd you expect,
a jar of moonshine?

20:28.061 --> 20:30.521
We're campers, not savages.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.772
(clears throat)

20:31.814 --> 20:33.774
What are you doing
with my New York Times?

20:33.816 --> 20:35.068
Starting a fire.

20:35.109 --> 20:36.903
Don't worry, I didn't
touch the Style section.

20:36.944 --> 20:38.821
(sighs)

20:40.907 --> 20:43.868
Is that thunder?

20:43.910 --> 20:45.244
Ryan.

20:45.285 --> 20:46.453
Did you check the weather?

20:46.495 --> 20:47.454
Not exactly.

20:48.581 --> 20:49.749
Well, it never rains in L.A.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.250
Yeah, apparently it does.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.589
I'm so happy
I wore my suede boots.

20:56.630 --> 20:59.383
What do you want me to do?

20:59.425 --> 21:01.468
Well, obviously there's
nothing you can do!

21:02.803 --> 21:04.722
(grunts)

21:04.764 --> 21:08.392
Just, uh, pull the...
Give it a... Yeah, that's...

21:08.434 --> 21:10.061
Okay.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.487
This is going well.

21:25.201 --> 21:27.286
Okay, what about this?
All you have to do

21:27.327 --> 21:28.704
is get Naomi's sister
alone in her bedroom.

21:28.746 --> 21:30.081
You know, seduce her.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.166
Get her to admit that she
slept with you on prom night.

21:32.208 --> 21:33.709
Meanwhile...
Navid.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.128
No, you hide Naomi
behind a curtain

21:35.169 --> 21:36.420
until she hears everything,

21:36.462 --> 21:38.422
just like Polonius in Hamlet,
my friend.

21:38.464 --> 21:39.882
Doesn't Polonius get stabbed?

21:39.924 --> 21:41.550
Whoa! Spoiler.

21:41.592 --> 21:43.094
I haven't even started
my English homework.

21:43.136 --> 21:45.263
Guys, I'm not
seducing Jen.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.347
That is the worst idea
we've had yet.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.100
Dude, it's a brilliant idea.
Maybe we should

21:49.142 --> 21:50.476
just forget about
the whole thing.
Whoa, whoa!

21:50.517 --> 21:51.518
You're not giving up, are you?

21:51.560 --> 21:52.686
I don't know, maybe.

21:52.728 --> 21:53.896
Come on, Hamlet.

21:53.938 --> 21:55.022
We'll figure something out.

21:55.064 --> 21:57.524
Yeah, dude, we'll figure
something out.

21:59.902 --> 22:03.197
The dip, it was excellent,
Mrs. Wilson.

22:04.364 --> 22:06.575
(sighs):
Thanks.

22:08.161 --> 22:11.289
So... (laughs)

22:11.330 --> 22:12.790
Oh, um, I haven't

22:12.832 --> 22:14.458
told you guys, I don't think,

22:14.500 --> 22:19.130
but Jasper and I are
working on a film together.

22:19.172 --> 22:20.714
Wow, that's great.

22:20.756 --> 22:23.301
Uh, sweetie, could you
hand me a napkin?

22:23.342 --> 22:25.094
DEBBIE:
Yeah, there you go.

22:26.344 --> 22:28.597
Yeah, I-I-I've seen
some of the footage,

22:28.639 --> 22:30.224
and it's gorgeous.

22:31.184 --> 22:33.102
He's a genius.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.353
Annie's my inspiration.

22:37.064 --> 22:40.400
Jasper, what else do you
do besides filmmaking?

22:40.442 --> 22:41.819
Uh...

22:41.861 --> 22:44.197
not a whole lot.

22:44.238 --> 22:46.406
And who are your friends
at West Bev?

22:46.448 --> 22:48.951
Well, it's... pretty
much just Annie.

22:50.286 --> 22:53.164
Yeah, 'cause the kids
at West Bev suck.

22:53.206 --> 22:54.165
All right, they're all

22:54.207 --> 22:56.000
lemmings and-and
spoiled brats.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.127
All right? We don't want
to be friends with them.
Annie.

22:58.169 --> 22:59.670
Come on, they're
not all bad.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.547
Just because you
had a falling-out

23:01.588 --> 23:03.090
with your friends
doesn't...

23:03.132 --> 23:05.301
Okay. Those people
were never

23:05.343 --> 23:07.845
my friends.
Annie, look at me.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.931
We talked about this,
right, and we just got
to forget about it, babe.

23:10.973 --> 23:12.516
I know. I know.

23:12.558 --> 23:14.392
You're right.

23:14.434 --> 23:16.187
(quietly):
Sorry.

23:16.229 --> 23:18.105
JASPER: It's okay.
You're right.

23:18.147 --> 23:20.024
Well, I bet dinner is

23:20.066 --> 23:21.650
almost ready-- I'm
gonna check on that.

23:21.692 --> 23:22.651
Oh, no, no, please.

23:22.693 --> 23:23.986
You sit, we-we've
got this,

23:24.028 --> 23:25.863
thank you.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.614
(sighs)

23:28.908 --> 23:31.244
I feel like I'm
totally blowing it.

23:31.285 --> 23:32.578
Did I do
something wrong?

23:32.619 --> 23:35.248
No. No, you are...
you're perfect.

23:35.289 --> 23:37.166
It's them.

23:37.208 --> 23:39.668
Look, um, right
before you got here,

23:39.710 --> 23:41.712
Dixon told them
that stupid rumor

23:41.754 --> 23:44.173
about you being
a drug dealer or whatever.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.301
DEBBIE:
Dinner's ready.

23:47.343 --> 23:49.553
Doesn't really matter.

23:52.265 --> 23:55.059
I hope you like
mahi mahi.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.144
Look, I know that you think
I'm a drug dealer.

23:58.312 --> 23:59.980
It's not true.
W-Well, obviously.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.566
It's been hard for me

24:02.608 --> 24:04.402
to fit in at West Bev.

24:04.442 --> 24:07.363
I mean, people, they're
always talking about
me behind my back,

24:07.405 --> 24:10.574
and I never... used to care

24:10.616 --> 24:12.910
what anyone
even thought about me.

24:12.952 --> 24:16.872
But now... that I'm with Annie,

24:16.914 --> 24:18.416
I mean, everything
has changed.

24:18.456 --> 24:19.583
'Cause when I'm with her,

24:19.625 --> 24:21.794
I feel like
I have a place in the world.

24:21.835 --> 24:24.046
I care about her so
much, and I just know

24:24.088 --> 24:25.923
that if you...

24:25.965 --> 24:28.426
just give me a chance,

24:28.466 --> 24:31.511
you'll see that all I want is
what's best for your daughter.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.266
Well, I'm glad
to hear you say that,

24:35.308 --> 24:37.601
because that's all
that we want, too.

24:37.643 --> 24:41.439
Great.
All right, why don't
you try some of that. Here.

24:41.479 --> 24:42.731
Sounds good.

24:42.773 --> 24:44.858
Annie?
Yes, please!
Dig in.

24:47.153 --> 24:50.197
(sighs):
Navid, I'm here
to unpack your crap.

24:51.449 --> 24:52.908
Hey,

24:52.950 --> 24:54.952
could you give
me a hand?

24:54.994 --> 24:56.412
Please, I'm gonna drop it.

24:56.454 --> 24:57.495
Okay.

24:58.372 --> 25:00.498
All right, um,

25:00.540 --> 25:02.709
let's just set it
over there. All right.

25:03.501 --> 25:05.503
Oh!
Oh, God!

25:06.464 --> 25:07.673
(groans)

25:16.223 --> 25:17.641
Thanks.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.852
I tried to find
the crushed ice.

25:19.893 --> 25:22.938
All they had
was cubed.

25:22.980 --> 25:25.565
Are you okay?

25:25.607 --> 25:28.152
Yeah, I'm fine.

25:29.487 --> 25:30.654
What?

25:32.490 --> 25:36.202
If I could take back what
happened last year, I would.

25:36.243 --> 25:39.121
I think about it
every single day.

25:41.665 --> 25:44.126
Well, well, well,
she finally showed up.

25:44.168 --> 25:45.627
(chuckles)
Oh, uh,

25:45.669 --> 25:46.962
I'm sorry, I, uh...

25:47.004 --> 25:48.130
Let's get back
to work, huh?

25:48.172 --> 25:49.840
Yeah, uh,
let's get back to work.

25:50.674 --> 25:52.385
(clears throat)

25:54.552 --> 25:56.389
KELLY:
Hey, Silver.

25:56.430 --> 25:57.681
It's your ride calling.

25:57.723 --> 25:59.933
I was waiting outside for you;
you never came out.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.686
So now I'm here in the hall
outside Mom's room.

26:02.728 --> 26:06.190
Only I don't see you
anywhere, so...

26:06.232 --> 26:07.565
hope everything's okay.

26:07.607 --> 26:10.486
Call me when you get this--
or just come find me.

26:10.528 --> 26:11.737
Okay.

26:16.909 --> 26:19.328
What-what happened?
Where is she?

26:19.370 --> 26:21.414
I just clean the room.

26:33.884 --> 26:35.593
(exhales)

27:11.171 --> 27:12.881
(exhales)

27:14.592 --> 27:16.969
Great. So,
can we go home now?

27:17.010 --> 27:18.471
It'll let up soon.

27:18.512 --> 27:20.680
Oh, come on,
the car's all packed up.

27:20.722 --> 27:23.183
(laughs):
Let's... cut
our losses here.

27:23.225 --> 27:25.603
(sighs):
Wow.

27:25.643 --> 27:27.187
(chuckles)

27:27.229 --> 27:29.356
This was clearly
a huge mistake.

27:29.398 --> 27:31.400
What are you
talking about?
Oh, I don't know,

27:31.442 --> 27:34.278
I just thought maybe once
we could do something
that I wanted to do

27:34.320 --> 27:37.531
instead of always doing
what you want to do,
but I guess I'm the one

27:37.573 --> 27:39.699
who makes sacrifices
in the relationship.

27:39.741 --> 27:41.201
Sacrifices?

27:41.243 --> 27:42.702
What, you don't enjoy...

27:42.744 --> 27:44.371
The extravagant auctions,

27:44.413 --> 27:45.663
the, uh, lavish night clubs,

27:45.705 --> 27:47.541
the charities where
people don't even know

27:47.583 --> 27:48.834
what charity
they're supporting?

27:48.875 --> 27:50.836
No, actually, I don't.

27:50.877 --> 27:52.879
But I go, anyways.

27:52.921 --> 27:56.550
You know, and I let you tell
me who I have to impress,

27:56.592 --> 27:58.760
and squeeze my elbow whenever
I do something wrong,

27:58.802 --> 28:00.220
which is all the time.

28:00.262 --> 28:03.265
I walk around on egg
shells, and it's not fun.

28:05.601 --> 28:08.061
But I put up with it...

28:08.103 --> 28:10.314
because it's what
you want to do.

28:12.149 --> 28:14.568
(sighs):
I...

28:14.610 --> 28:17.488
I had no idea.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.618
I thought you were
enjoying yourself.

28:22.660 --> 28:24.537
Yeah, I know you did.
Oh.

28:28.248 --> 28:30.543
Look, we can't drive
down the mountain

28:30.584 --> 28:32.211
in this weather,
all right?

28:32.252 --> 28:34.754
As soon as it lets up,
I'll take you home.

28:46.808 --> 28:48.561
Kelly?

28:48.602 --> 28:49.853
You okay?

28:49.895 --> 28:51.771
(crying):
Yeah, you were right.

28:51.813 --> 28:53.899
You said I should say
good-bye, and I didn't.

28:53.940 --> 28:55.609
Now it's too late.

28:55.651 --> 28:57.986
No, it... it's not too late.

28:58.028 --> 28:59.988
(sniffles):
What?

29:01.615 --> 29:04.034
No, they... they moved
her to a private room.

29:05.452 --> 29:07.621
You still have time
to say good-bye.

29:07.663 --> 29:10.457
(exhales)

29:10.499 --> 29:12.292
Okay.
(sniffles)

29:14.378 --> 29:16.838
ANNIE (sighs):
Okay,

29:16.880 --> 29:19.925
so I-I know that the first
half of that was kind
of totally unbearable,

29:19.966 --> 29:23.011
and maybe we did need
one of dad's corny jokes
to break the ice,

29:23.053 --> 29:25.681
but I think it really
turned around when
we started the fish.

29:25.723 --> 29:26.806
Which was delicious,

29:26.848 --> 29:28.601
by the way.

29:28.642 --> 29:30.477
And I want
to thank you both so much

29:30.519 --> 29:31.978
for just, you know,
listening to Jasper

29:32.020 --> 29:33.146
and giving him a second chance.

29:35.399 --> 29:36.692
What?

29:36.734 --> 29:38.151
Annie, we don't think

29:38.193 --> 29:39.695
you should see
Jasper anymore.

29:39.737 --> 29:42.781
Y-You don't think I should?

29:42.822 --> 29:44.032
No.
I know
you're upset,

29:44.074 --> 29:45.825
but we're doing
what's best for you.

29:45.867 --> 29:48.370
Is this because
of that stupid rumor?

29:48.412 --> 29:49.538
Obviously,
that concerns us.

29:49.580 --> 29:50.539
We know Navid;

29:50.581 --> 29:52.499
we trust him.
But it's a lie!

29:52.541 --> 29:54.000
No, it's more
than the rumor.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.544
Jasper is... odd.

29:55.586 --> 29:57.170
How can you say that?

29:57.212 --> 29:58.547
You don't even know him.

29:58.589 --> 30:00.299
He doesn't have
any friends.

30:00.340 --> 30:02.509
Yeah, because the kids
at are school suck!

30:02.551 --> 30:03.510
(quietly):
Oh, Annie.

30:03.552 --> 30:04.886
Annie, you are
not yourself

30:04.928 --> 30:06.179
around him.

30:06.221 --> 30:07.681
You're not a... a loner

30:07.723 --> 30:08.890
or an outcast.

30:08.932 --> 30:11.893
You have no idea
who I am anymore!

30:28.619 --> 30:30.203
Hi, Kel.

30:30.245 --> 30:32.080
Hi, Mom.

30:32.122 --> 30:34.500
I'm so glad you came.

30:36.918 --> 30:39.212
Sorry it took
me so long.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.214
You shouldn't
apologize.

30:41.256 --> 30:43.550
I'm the one who's sorry.

30:43.592 --> 30:46.762
I've been... a terrible mother.

30:47.929 --> 30:49.848
It's just...

30:49.889 --> 30:53.018
you didn't turn out at all
like I expected.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.480
Mom...
And...

30:56.522 --> 30:58.732
thank God for that.

30:58.774 --> 31:02.695
Because you are so much better.

31:02.736 --> 31:06.239
(exhales):
The way you have raised Silver.

31:06.281 --> 31:10.160
I don't know how you learned
how to be such a good mother.

31:10.202 --> 31:12.912
(laughs):
But you are.

31:14.122 --> 31:17.917
You're such an amazing
person, Kelly.

31:17.959 --> 31:20.920
You are so beautiful...

31:20.962 --> 31:22.464
strong...

31:22.506 --> 31:24.550
and caring.

31:24.591 --> 31:25.718
(sniffles)

31:25.759 --> 31:28.554
I'm so proud of you.

31:29.847 --> 31:31.807
And I am so sorry...

31:31.849 --> 31:33.058
(crying)

31:33.099 --> 31:35.394
...for everything that happened.

31:38.271 --> 31:40.315
I forgive you.

31:40.357 --> 31:43.652
(crying)

31:43.694 --> 31:45.529
(whispers):
Thank you...

31:45.571 --> 31:46.613
(sniffles)

31:46.655 --> 31:47.989
...for coming.

31:50.158 --> 31:52.786
I've been so tired,

31:52.828 --> 31:57.374
but I knew that I just had
to hang on till you got here.

32:01.837 --> 32:04.214
I love you, Kelly.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.484
(sighs)

32:24.526 --> 32:25.485
Hey.

32:25.527 --> 32:28.154
Hi.

32:28.196 --> 32:30.240
Did you get all
that crap unpacked?

32:30.282 --> 32:32.158
(laughs):
I wasn't much help.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.327
What are you doing here?

32:34.369 --> 32:38.248
Well, I, uh...

32:38.290 --> 32:41.668
I heard that you
apologized to Richard.

32:41.710 --> 32:44.546
And I have to say,
I'm... I'm impressed.

32:44.588 --> 32:46.506
Well, you were right.

32:46.548 --> 32:48.842
I needed to be honest with him.

32:48.884 --> 32:50.636
Oh, come on, you made a mistake.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.471
So what? So did I, you know?

32:52.512 --> 32:54.556
I... I totally overreacted,

32:54.598 --> 32:56.850
and I shouldn't
have gotten so upset.

32:56.892 --> 32:58.518
But you did the
right thing.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.687
And once I heard that,

33:00.729 --> 33:02.940
you know, it was hard for me

33:02.981 --> 33:04.942
to stay mad at the girl
I'm falling for.

33:06.359 --> 33:08.320
And I am,

33:08.361 --> 33:10.196
Naomi.

33:10.238 --> 33:11.740
I'm falling for you.

33:17.830 --> 33:19.873
I need to be honest
with you, too.

33:19.915 --> 33:24.753
It was my dream
to meet someone like you.

33:24.795 --> 33:26.755
But the truth is...

33:26.797 --> 33:29.508
I'm still hung up
on someone else.

33:29.549 --> 33:31.176
Someone I thought I was over.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.809
I hope he's worth it.

33:59.538 --> 34:02.374
You know, that mahi mahi wasn't
half bad, Annie.

34:02.415 --> 34:03.750
Jasper...

34:03.792 --> 34:06.503
When can I come back
and try the chicken tarragon?

34:06.545 --> 34:09.047
Look, they said that
I can't see you anymore.

34:12.759 --> 34:14.011
Jasper?

34:14.052 --> 34:15.846
I'm here.

34:15.888 --> 34:17.429
I mean,
they still believe Navid.

34:17.472 --> 34:19.431
Otherwise, I know that
they would have loved you,

34:19.474 --> 34:21.266
I know that, but...

34:21.309 --> 34:22.936
Look, just calm down, Annie.

34:22.978 --> 34:27.315
There's no point
in getting mad at anyone.

34:28.315 --> 34:30.443
It's not gonna help anything.

34:30.485 --> 34:34.989
What's done is done, right?

34:35.032 --> 34:37.743
Yeah, but what
are we gonna do?

34:37.784 --> 34:40.913
We'll figure something out,
okay? I promise.

34:40.954 --> 34:44.456
Okay.

34:44.498 --> 34:47.753
Yeah, we'll figure
something out.

34:47.793 --> 34:49.295
Yeah.

35:01.474 --> 35:02.768
Hey.

35:02.809 --> 35:04.895
I know I should've called
first, but your mom let me in.

35:04.937 --> 35:06.646
Hey.

35:06.688 --> 35:08.732
I had the perfect guy, Ade.

35:08.774 --> 35:11.234
He went to my
dream school,

35:11.276 --> 35:12.402
he plays football,

35:12.444 --> 35:14.738
he's SAE.
What is wrong with me?

35:14.780 --> 35:16.656
Would you mind
shutting the door?

35:16.698 --> 35:17.699
Oh, yeah, sure.

35:19.826 --> 35:21.494
What are you doing?

35:21.536 --> 35:25.082
Nothing.
So, what happened with Jamie?

35:25.123 --> 35:26.207
What's in your purse?

35:27.667 --> 35:30.003
Stop it! Stop!
Give it to me.

35:30.045 --> 35:31.337
It's private.

35:31.379 --> 35:33.381
Are you kidding me?

35:34.382 --> 35:36.134
You lied to me again?

35:38.887 --> 35:40.513
I'm... I'm sorry.

35:40.555 --> 35:43.349
Are you ever gonna stop this?

35:45.060 --> 35:46.227
You know what?

35:48.229 --> 35:49.940
Do what you want.
I'm over it.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.966
(crickets chirping)

36:31.523 --> 36:33.399
(car door closes)

36:37.278 --> 36:40.448
How long have
you been out here?

36:42.701 --> 36:44.536
Since the rain stopped.

36:44.577 --> 36:46.997
And, uh, how did you start
a fire?

36:47.039 --> 36:48.165
(sighs)

36:48.206 --> 36:49.749
The Style section.

36:49.791 --> 36:51.751
Hmm. (chuckles)

36:51.793 --> 36:53.545
Look, I'm sorry
that I forced you

36:53.586 --> 36:55.547
to go all those... parties.

36:55.588 --> 36:58.175
No, I mean, you know,
how would you know I hated them?

36:58.216 --> 36:59.176
I wasn't honest.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.677
Well, we're in a relationship.

37:00.719 --> 37:03.262
I wouldn't expect you
to be honest.

37:03.304 --> 37:05.264
You don't really mean that.

37:05.306 --> 37:07.350
Come on, Ryan.
I know the cliché.

37:07.392 --> 37:08.768
Tell each other
everything,

37:08.810 --> 37:12.147
no secrets, blah-blah-blah.

37:12.189 --> 37:14.440
But in the real world...

37:14.482 --> 37:15.692
it doesn't work.

37:15.734 --> 37:16.860
Jen, come on. That's...

37:16.902 --> 37:17.610
Honest.

37:17.652 --> 37:18.904
No, it's sad.

37:18.945 --> 37:20.697
I mean, if you really
believe that...

37:20.739 --> 37:22.199
Of course I do.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.449
I mean,

37:23.491 --> 37:27.120
you say that you want
to know everything,

37:27.162 --> 37:28.621
but you really don't.

37:28.663 --> 37:29.915
I do.

37:29.956 --> 37:33.292
Jen... I really like you.

37:33.334 --> 37:35.128
It's my point.

37:35.170 --> 37:36.295
And there's nothing
you could tell me--

37:36.337 --> 37:37.463
short of a Charles Manson
streak--

37:37.505 --> 37:38.798
that would make me
like you less.

37:45.430 --> 37:47.766
I'm broke and living off Naomi.

37:47.807 --> 37:48.975
So?

37:49.017 --> 37:50.602
What do you mean, "so"?

37:50.643 --> 37:51.811
It's not like

37:51.853 --> 37:53.271
I'm dating you for your money.

37:53.312 --> 37:55.273
I mean,
if anything,

37:55.314 --> 37:57.067
I'm dating you
despite your money.

37:57.109 --> 37:59.485
How'd you lose it?

38:02.614 --> 38:05.324
I blew it
trying to land my husband.

38:07.493 --> 38:08.995
(chuckles)

38:09.037 --> 38:10.580
Your-your husband?

38:10.622 --> 38:11.957
Well, I'm getting a divorce,

38:11.998 --> 38:15.334
but yes, he is technically
still my husband.

38:15.376 --> 38:19.965
(chuckles)
Okay, that's, um...

38:20.006 --> 38:21.674
Why-why didn't
you tell me that?

38:21.716 --> 38:26.179
(voice breaking):
Because then you would
ask me why

38:26.221 --> 38:29.599
the relationship ended.

38:31.101 --> 38:33.895
And...?

38:36.731 --> 38:38.524
He cheated on me.

38:40.526 --> 38:41.694
Sorry.

38:41.736 --> 38:43.362
There you go.

38:43.404 --> 38:45.364
Sorry.

38:45.406 --> 38:48.160
Whatever.

38:48.201 --> 38:49.327
It happens.

38:49.368 --> 38:52.080
No, it doesn't happen.

38:52.122 --> 38:53.248
I mean,

38:53.290 --> 38:56.251
it shouldn't happen.

38:59.587 --> 39:01.464
(sighs)

39:04.092 --> 39:07.095
Look, I, for one,

39:07.137 --> 39:09.306
would never cheat on you.

39:11.975 --> 39:14.560
Honestly?

39:14.602 --> 39:15.728
Honestly.

39:50.305 --> 39:52.473
(soft exhale)

40:33.514 --> 40:35.267
(sighs)

41:02.043 --> 41:03.669
I got it.
I know what to do.

41:03.711 --> 41:05.213
I know how exactly
what we're gonna do

41:05.255 --> 41:06.256
to take down
Naomi's sister.

41:06.298 --> 41:08.883
GIRL:
Somebody help!

41:08.925 --> 41:10.718
(anxious murmuring)
