Okay. And?

AILANA:
<i> They've retained a lawyer</i>

00:14.348 --> 00:17.016
Crime lab processed that
Cali cartel guy's cell phone.

00:17.018 --> 00:18.517
Turns out one of
his contacts is

00:18.519 --> 00:21.153
the family that Sara's
gonna live with in Mexico.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.589
Doesn't mean they're
in the drug business.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.791
You wouldn't be here if
you didn't think they were.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.726
<i> I wanted to talk</i>
<i> to you about Sara.</i>

00:27.728 --> 00:29.028
Her mother's family
back in Mexico

00:29.030 --> 00:30.596
is taking steps
to adopt her.

00:30.598 --> 00:31.597
You run background
on them.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.532
I did, and they
came back clean.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.401
But now some evidence
has come to light

00:35.403 --> 00:36.735
that suggests otherwise.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.020
You're a U.S. Attorney.

00:38.021 --> 00:39.304
You've worked with
the Federales in Mexico.

00:39.306 --> 00:40.539
I'm guessing your contacts
over there

00:40.541 --> 00:41.540
are much stronger
than mine.

who's being treated
at a local hospital.

05:53.987 --> 05:56.488
He was driving Sara home

Maria said

06:04.497 --> 06:06.030
there'd been no call
or ransom demand.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.066
That's still the case--
no contact as of yet.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.368
Is that unusual?

06:09.370 --> 06:10.736
Not the norm.

06:10.738 --> 06:11.937
Has the dead kidnapper
been I.D.'d?

06:11.939 --> 06:13.672
No. His partners
retrieved his body,

06:13.674 --> 06:15.107
escaped from the scene.

06:15.109 --> 06:16.742
Okay, so what are
the local cops doing about it?

06:16.744 --> 06:18.477

they don't know?

06:20.748 --> 06:22.381
Little girl gets snatched
up in broad daylight,

06:22.383 --> 06:24.049

O.K. Corral shootout

06:24.051 --> 06:26.752
in the middle of the street,
and the cops don't know a thing?

06:26.754 --> 06:28.620
Believe me when I tell you
it's a good thing.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.088
If the kidnappers got word

06:30.090 --> 06:32.023
that the police are involved,
chances are...

06:32.025 --> 06:33.125
Chances are what?

06:33.127 --> 06:35.044

06:39.366 --> 06:41.767
Only about a thousand or so
were reported, for good reason.

06:41.769 --> 06:44.603
If local cops get involved,
people get twitchy.

06:44.605 --> 06:47.606
Most times, the gangs just...
cut their losses,

06:47.608 --> 06:49.608

06:49.610 --> 06:51.443
The best hope you have

10:57.924 --> 11:00.191
My son has
something similar.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.327
It's a little tin star.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.295
It says "Sheriff" on it.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.131
If you think this
guarantees your safety,

11:06.133 --> 11:08.767
or entitles you to act
without fear of consequences,

11:08.769 --> 11:11.036
without respect...

11:11.038 --> 11:13.572
you're very mistaken.

11:13.573 --> 11:16.107
Oh, no, no. I-I respect you
greatly, Mr. Ramirez.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.709
I know what kind of man you are.

11:17.710 --> 11:19.310
By the way, you got something
on your robe right there.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.285
(laughs)

11:28.955 --> 11:31.022
<i> Guero Loco...</i>

11:32.225 --> 11:34.826
36 hours ago,

11:34.828 --> 11:37.696
a young girl
by the name of Sara Diaz

11:37.698 --> 11:39.764
was kidnapped on her way home

11:39.766 --> 11:41.166
from St. Martha's school.

11:41.168 --> 11:43.034
Silver SUV,
four guys.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.870
One guy was killed at the scene.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.705
So far, there's been
no ransom call, no demands made.

11:46.707 --> 11:49.140
Are you implying I had
something to do with this?

11:49.142 --> 11:51.309
Not implying anything.
I'm asking you if you have Sara.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.344
If I had taken her,
I would've been paid by now,

11:53.346 --> 11:54.779
or she'd be dead already.

11:54.781 --> 11:56.748
Fine. Do you know where she is?

11:58.085 --> 12:00.452
Let me... let me give you
some advice,

12:00.454 --> 12:02.454
Commander Steve McGarrett.

12:02.456 --> 12:04.389
Your big John Wayne act

12:04.391 --> 12:06.991
may work in your little island,
but here in Juarez,

12:06.993 --> 12:10.328
you're just gonna get yourself
and that little girl killed.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.730
I-I'm sorry.

12:11.732 --> 12:13.131
I'm a little confused.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.767
I was led to believe

12:15.769 --> 12:18.970
that nothing happens here
without you knowing about it.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.172
Many opportunists out there
these days.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.274
It's hard to see everything
that's going on,

12:23.276 --> 12:25.410
even from the top
of the mountain.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.278
<i> Papi!  Mirame!</i>

12:28.482 --> 12:31.516
(laughs)
<i> Increible!</i>

12:31.518 --> 12:34.185
<i> Increible!</i>
<i> Muy bien, mi hijo!</i>

12:34.187 --> 12:36.521
(chuckles)
<i>Muy bien.</i>

12:36.523 --> 12:40.091
That's a beautiful
kid you got there.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.392
Mr. Ramirez,

12:41.394 --> 12:43.294
I, uh... I really mean
no disrespect,

12:43.296 --> 12:46.297
I just want to get this little
girl home to her family safely.

12:46.299 --> 12:47.465
You understand?

12:51.204 --> 12:53.404
The people who did take her

12:53.406 --> 12:56.908
are using a different playbook
than mine.

12:56.910 --> 13:00.211
That makes them unpredictable
and very, very dangerous.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.847
So when they call you--
and they will--

13:02.849 --> 13:06.017
keep your gun in your holster
and your sheriff badge

13:06.019 --> 13:08.186
in your pocket,
and do exactly what they say,

13:08.188 --> 13:09.888
to the letter.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.456
For you, it's family.

13:11.458 --> 13:15.126
For them, just a payday.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.428
And if they have to dump
this one, they will,

13:17.430 --> 13:20.131
because in Juarez,
there's always another victim.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.267
Now...

13:22.269 --> 13:24.803
it's time for you to get
the hell out of my property.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.010
(speaking Spanish)

13:35.048 --> 13:37.382
GROVER: One more thing.
You do speak Spanish, right?

13:37.384 --> 13:40.118
DANNY:
Eh, I barely speak English.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.252
Look, man.

13:41.254 --> 13:44.422
<i> "Soy Americano." </i>
That's it.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.024
That's all I know.
That's good.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.458
Oh, how about this?

13:47.460 --> 13:51.830
<i>Tienes una sonrisa</i>
<i>muy hermosa.</i>

13:51.832 --> 13:53.565
Why didn't you just say
you were fluent, man?

13:53.567 --> 13:55.350
What does that mean?

13:55.351 --> 13:57.134
(chuckles) It means,
"You have a beautiful smile."

13:57.137 --> 13:58.369
Oh.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.974
Well, that's
not it, is it?

14:02.976 --> 14:04.342
Yeah, that's it.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.543
What do you
mean, that's it?

14:05.545 --> 14:07.011
You just said,
<i>"Soy Americano."</i>

14:07.013 --> 14:09.414
At least I got
a full sentence.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.249
You rolling R's and stuff,

14:11.251 --> 14:12.984
I thought you knew
what you was doing.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.354
Excuse me.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.357
<i> Amigo, uh...</i>

14:19.359 --> 14:22.227
<i> Soy Americano.</i>

14:24.064 --> 14:25.296
That's good.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.931
Well, I'm not gonna use
my Spanish.

14:26.933 --> 14:27.966
I speak English.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.100
Oh, good, good.
GROVER: Good.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.336
We're both here
to identify a body.

14:31.338 --> 14:32.937
You probably got
this body in the last

14:32.939 --> 14:34.372
four of five hours.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.373
It's very badly burned.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.941
You...

14:36.943 --> 14:38.376
You need to submit
an official request.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.278
Okay. All right.
That's no problem.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.380
That's fine. How long is this
gonna take? The whole thing?

14:42.382 --> 14:44.349
One, maybe two weeks.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.617
Oh, no.

14:45.619 --> 14:46.584
That's-that's no good.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.953
Uh, my friend
and I here

14:48.955 --> 14:50.455
are in a rush;
uh, it's very important.

14:50.457 --> 14:51.656
<i> Mucho importante.</i>

14:51.658 --> 14:52.657
I'm sorry, señor.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.292
There are protocols.

14:54.294 --> 14:55.593
GROVER:
Well, um,

14:55.595 --> 14:57.095
why don't we just have
a little conversation

14:57.097 --> 15:00.298
with my, uh, good friend
Mr. Benjamin Franklin.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.566
Can, uh, relax those protocols.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.167
Go ahead. Get that up in here.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.336
What do you say?
No.

15:05.338 --> 15:06.971
You ain't got to be
all stank about it.

15:06.973 --> 15:08.606
All right. Well, I got,
uh, some other names

15:08.608 --> 15:10.125
that might help, uh,

15:10.126 --> 15:11.643
twist your arm a little bit,
all right?

15:12.612 --> 15:13.611
(sighs)

15:13.613 --> 15:15.597
GROVER:
<i> Mm-hmm.</i>

15:15.598 --> 15:17.582
Turn your nose up
at Mr. Franklin, you end up

15:17.584 --> 15:19.951
with Mr. Heckler and Mr. Koch.
(sighs)

15:19.953 --> 15:22.387
Those German guys can be
pretty persuasive.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.556
In here.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.158
Okay. After you.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.427
Come on, man.
<i>Vamanos.</i>

15:33.667 --> 15:35.633
This is the one.

15:35.635 --> 15:38.069
Obviously, we haven't
conducted an autopsy yet.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.404
That's one of the reasons
we don't have

15:39.406 --> 15:40.939
the information you need.

15:40.941 --> 15:42.273
That's it, for sure?
Yes.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.942
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Where you going?

15:43.944 --> 15:45.310
Go sit down.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.613
Don't move.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.715
All right. We found what
we're looking for. Now what?

15:50.717 --> 15:51.716
I don't know now what.

15:51.718 --> 15:54.652
Uh, I got an idea.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.020
(phone rings)

15:56.021 --> 15:57.387
Good morning,
this is Dr. Max Bergman.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.023
Max. Danny.

15:59.025 --> 16:00.091
Danny who?

16:00.093 --> 16:01.626
Williams.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.361
Yes.

16:03.363 --> 16:04.729
I am in Mexico.

16:04.731 --> 16:07.031
More specifically,
I am in Juarez.

16:07.033 --> 16:10.034
I'm standing
in the middle of a morgue.

16:10.036 --> 16:11.603
I need to ask you
a very important question.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.171
Hypothetically speaking,
if I needed

16:13.173 --> 16:16.007
to identify a body
that's been burned badly,

16:16.009 --> 16:18.042
how would I go about doing that?
Six years of medical school,

16:18.044 --> 16:20.211
four years of residency,
a yearlong fellowship,

16:20.213 --> 16:21.679
get board certified...

16:21.681 --> 16:23.514
All right, that's funny, Max.
I obviously cannot do

16:23.516 --> 16:25.750
any of those things right now
with you on the phone.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.118
How would I do it?

16:28.588 --> 16:30.421
Max.
I'm thinking.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.322
He's thinking.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.991
Oh, boy.

16:32.993 --> 16:35.259
How severe is the burn trauma
on the cadaver?

16:35.261 --> 16:37.128
How severe is the burn trauma?

16:37.130 --> 16:38.997
Well, how the hell
should I know?

16:38.999 --> 16:41.099
I don't know.
Maybe you're gonna have to look.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.166
Mm-hmm.

16:49.442 --> 16:52.043
(unzipping)

16:52.045 --> 16:54.112
Ugh! Mm-mm.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.713
(groans)
Ooh.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.049
Let me put it like this.

16:58.051 --> 17:01.586
Um, last weekend,
I let Will do the barbecue.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.087
This is how the meat came out.

17:03.089 --> 17:05.156
Not good, Max. Not good at all.

17:05.158 --> 17:07.191
Well, then taking pictures
of the victim's fingerprints

17:07.193 --> 17:08.393
won't work.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.096
No, no, no, no, no.

17:12.098 --> 17:14.098
Max, I don't want
to bust your chops,

17:14.100 --> 17:15.633
but we kind of
got to get moving on,

17:15.635 --> 17:17.668
so if you got any ideas,
please let us know.

17:17.670 --> 17:20.772
Well, given your extremely
limited technical skills,

17:20.774 --> 17:24.075
little or no recourse
to lab analytics,

17:24.077 --> 17:26.310
which rules out
DNA or dental testing,

17:26.312 --> 17:28.379
and given your aforementioned
time pressure,

17:28.381 --> 17:29.714
it is quite difficult

17:29.716 --> 17:31.549
to come up with a...
Max. Shut up.

17:32.285 --> 17:33.484
Yes or no? Help or not?

17:33.486 --> 17:34.619
(mutters)

17:34.621 --> 17:37.405
I do have a solution.

17:37.406 --> 17:40.190
If your victim has a tattoo,
we may be able to I.D. the body.

17:40.193 --> 17:42.460
See, uh, if he's got a tattoo.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.062
A tattoo on what?

17:44.064 --> 17:45.563
This whole thing
is Cajun-style, man.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.365
You saw this thing.
It's, uh...

17:47.367 --> 17:48.733
the whole thing is CBR.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.234
It's CBR. What's CBR?

17:50.236 --> 17:51.335
You don't have a grill?

17:51.337 --> 17:53.171
Charred beyond recognition.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.640
It's charred
beyond recognition, Max.

17:55.642 --> 17:58.109
Well, CBR or not,
together we can do this.

17:58.111 --> 17:59.310
Trust me.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.512
(sighs)

18:01.514 --> 18:03.748
CHIN:<i> We're still waiting</i>
<i> on the call.</i>

18:03.750 --> 18:06.284
Please tell me
you got somewhere.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.752
STEVE:
As far as I can tell,

18:07.754 --> 18:10.188
this is not one of
Ramirez's plays, and he didn't

18:10.190 --> 18:12.256
bring anybody else in
the frame either, but listen.

18:12.258 --> 18:15.159
He said some stuff about the
whole K&R business down here,

18:15.161 --> 18:17.328
and my gut is telling me
we really need to rethink

18:17.330 --> 18:19.363
our tactical approach
on this one.

18:19.365 --> 18:20.765
How so?

18:20.767 --> 18:23.101
Usually, I'd say the ransom
is irrelevant, right?

18:23.103 --> 18:24.769
We're just gonna sit back,
wait for the call,

18:24.771 --> 18:26.771
and then take this crew out
at the drop,

18:26.773 --> 18:28.272
but it's different here.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.540
It's too
dangerous, buddy.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.275
No matter how
good our plan,

18:31.277 --> 18:33.578
we're gonna be risking Sara's
life; that's the bottom line.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.880
KONO: I think the best thing
we can do in this situation

18:35.882 --> 18:38.149
is make sure things
are done as smoothly

18:38.151 --> 18:40.251
as possible, with no problems.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.120
Which means we get these guys
whatever money they ask for,

18:42.122 --> 18:44.622
and we get Sara the hell
out of there safely, okay?

18:44.624 --> 18:45.756
Okay.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.158
You hear from Danny?

18:47.160 --> 18:48.493
No. No, not yet.

18:48.494 --> 18:49.827
We'll be back soon,
all right? Sit tight.

18:51.564 --> 18:54.265
Well?

18:54.267 --> 18:57.135
(sighs)
No new information.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.669
I don't understand.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.304
Why haven't they called?

19:00.306 --> 19:02.206
There must be something more
that we can do.

19:03.610 --> 19:06.310
I should've never let Sara
come down here.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.412
You say that
like you had a choice.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.350
The courts decided.

19:12.352 --> 19:15.520
We are her closest blood
relatives, Lieutenant Kelly.

19:15.522 --> 19:16.521
She's exactly where she...

19:16.523 --> 19:18.156
Where she should be?!

19:18.158 --> 19:20.725
Where is that?!

19:20.727 --> 19:23.161
Where is that right now,
Mr. Morales?

19:23.163 --> 19:24.629
Are you saying this is my fault?

19:24.631 --> 19:25.830
I'm not the one with
the drug dealer's number

19:25.832 --> 19:26.831
in their cell phone.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.534
He is a client
at my law firm.

19:29.536 --> 19:30.835
And that is it.

19:30.837 --> 19:31.836
Is it?

19:32.572 --> 19:34.238
Say it.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.174
Go ahead, say it,
Lieutenant Kelly!

19:36.176 --> 19:37.542
Say what you
really think of...

19:37.544 --> 19:38.743
(phone ringing)

19:38.745 --> 19:41.212
(crying):
Is it them?

19:41.214 --> 19:42.547
It's-it's an
unknown number.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.248
CHIN: Listen to me very
carefully. Stay calm.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.851
Keep them on the line
for as long as possible.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.653
Ask for proof of life.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.788
We need to hear Sara's voice.

19:54.260 --> 19:55.259
(phone beeps)

19:55.261 --> 19:56.460
<i>Hola.</i>

19:56.462 --> 19:57.695
MAN (distorted):
Mr. Morales,

19:57.697 --> 19:59.197
we want one million dollars

19:59.199 --> 20:01.899
in nonsequential,
unmarked bills.

20:01.901 --> 20:02.900
You have three hours.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.402
We will contact you again

20:04.404 --> 20:05.870
with instructions
for the exchange.

20:05.872 --> 20:09.273
If you call the police,
if you fail to answer the phone

20:09.275 --> 20:10.541
when we call again,

20:10.543 --> 20:13.344
if you deviate
from my orders in any way,

20:13.346 --> 20:15.246
we will kill Sara.

20:15.248 --> 20:16.514
Do you understand?

20:16.516 --> 20:17.782
I understand.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.285
Can I talk to her, please?
I-I just need to hear her voice.

20:21.287 --> 20:23.487
You can...
(line clicks, dial tone hums)

20:23.489 --> 20:25.556
(tapping keys)
CHIN: Damn it.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.225
(sighs)

20:27.227 --> 20:28.926
It's not long enough
for a trace.

20:28.928 --> 20:31.429
(crying):
Sara.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.331
Okay, all right.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.765
We have three hours, right?

20:34.767 --> 20:37.468
How long do you need to
get the cash together? Jorge!

20:39.239 --> 20:41.472
I-I can't pay it.

20:43.476 --> 20:45.509
I don't, I don't have the money.

20:45.511 --> 20:47.345
What?

20:47.347 --> 20:49.981
The court custody papers said
that you two were wealthy.

20:49.983 --> 20:51.983
I<i> did</i> have it.

20:51.985 --> 20:54.318
But I don't have it anymore.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.386
What are you talking about?

20:55.388 --> 20:56.587
About a month ago,

20:56.589 --> 20:58.556
I won a big case for a client,

20:58.558 --> 21:02.026
and he wanted to settle
his legal fees with cash.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.895
<i> So I was in the car;</i>
<i> I was going to the bank</i>

21:04.897 --> 21:07.398
<i> to deposit the money</i>
<i> when I got pulled over...</i>

21:08.401 --> 21:09.400
<i> ...by the police.</i>

21:09.402 --> 21:11.452
<i> They stole the money.</i>

21:11.453 --> 21:13.503
CHIN:<i> How did they even know</i>
<i> about the payout?</i>

21:13.506 --> 21:16.507
The police-- they have wiretaps
on all the law firms

21:16.509 --> 21:18.309
that have clients of interest.

21:18.311 --> 21:22.680
They do it so they can build
cases against the cartels.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.515
But they also do it
to try and shake down

21:24.517 --> 21:25.983
individuals, which is why

21:25.985 --> 21:27.852
I was very careful
not to use my work phone, but...

21:27.854 --> 21:30.388
That means all
of your phones are tapped!

21:30.390 --> 21:33.391
It's the only way they knew that
I had that kind of money on me

21:33.393 --> 21:34.759
at that time.

21:34.761 --> 21:38.596
It was over $700,000.

21:38.598 --> 21:41.599
If I had that money,

21:41.601 --> 21:44.602
plus our savings,

21:44.604 --> 21:46.404
we would make the ransom.

21:48.408 --> 21:49.473
We're just gonna
have to steal it back.

22:00.787 --> 22:03.421
Gentlemen, that indeed looks
like a tattoo. Congratulations.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.790
You see this guy looks
like a piece of beef jerky, Max.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.458
We don't have any fingerprints.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.427
How are we gonna lift
the tattoo?

22:09.429 --> 22:10.561
Well, despite popular belief,

22:10.563 --> 22:12.997
bodies actually do not burn
that well,

22:12.999 --> 22:15.499
even when doused in accelerants
such as gasoline.

22:15.501 --> 22:18.836
DANNY: Okay, well, Max,
this body is definitely burned

22:18.838 --> 22:20.071
well, all right?

22:20.073 --> 22:21.405
But whatever.
Let's just do this.

22:21.407 --> 22:23.808
And by "us," I mean you.

22:23.810 --> 22:26.043
What?! You better be playing.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.545
You got to do it. I can't. Mm-mm.
Well, how am I gonna do it?

22:27.547 --> 22:28.946
I don't know
what the hell I'm doing.

22:28.948 --> 22:31.082
You're gonna figure it out,
'cause I can't do this.

22:31.084 --> 22:32.550
Actually, this procedure
will require both of you.

22:32.552 --> 22:33.884
One will be holding the limb

22:33.886 --> 22:35.419
over the heat source,

22:35.421 --> 22:37.588
and the other will be peeling
the epidermis away.

22:37.590 --> 22:38.756
I'll hold the limb.

22:38.758 --> 22:40.825
I called it.

22:40.827 --> 22:42.360
This doesn't seem
like a good idea.

22:42.362 --> 22:43.962
I mean, heating this thing up?

22:43.963 --> 22:45.563
Don't you think that's just
gonna cook him further?

22:45.565 --> 22:47.431
When you're looking
at a person's tattoo,

22:47.433 --> 22:49.767
you're actually seeing the ink
through the epidermis,

22:49.769 --> 22:51.702
which is the outer layer
of the skin.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.437
The ink is actually
on the dermis,

22:53.439 --> 22:54.705
which is the lower layer.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.541
The cells of the dermis

22:56.542 --> 22:58.376
is actually far more stable
than the cells

22:58.378 --> 23:01.612
of the epidermis, so it is
my hope that the perpetrator's

23:01.614 --> 23:03.414
distinctive tattoo ink
will be visible

23:03.416 --> 23:05.082
after the epidermis
is stripped away,

23:05.084 --> 23:07.985
which you will do by heating it
and peeling it off.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.487
Oh, man.
(sizzling)

23:09.489 --> 23:12.490
Oh, man.
This-this ain't right, man.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.392
This ain't right.

23:15.528 --> 23:17.461
(muttering)

23:17.463 --> 23:19.597
It's sizzling.

23:19.599 --> 23:22.800
What you waiting on, man?
Get to, get to scraping!

23:23.703 --> 23:25.536
(groans)

23:25.538 --> 23:27.571
(Danny and Grover groaning)

23:29.976 --> 23:31.629
Danny, I don't feel good.
Can you please

23:31.655 --> 23:33.444
hold it still? Can you
please hold it still?

23:33.446 --> 23:36.147
I think I'm gonna throw up. Okay. Okay.
Don't throw up. Just hold it still.

23:36.149 --> 23:38.949
Stay on target, Detective.

23:38.951 --> 23:41.986
Oh, come on, man!
You can see it.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.521
Take the picture.

23:46.559 --> 23:48.159
This is so awful.

23:48.161 --> 23:51.662
Max, all right, listen,
I'm gonna send you some photos.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.464
Just, please,
the second you get an I.D.,

23:53.466 --> 23:55.466
send it to us as soon
as possible, all right?

23:55.468 --> 23:56.534
Roger that.

23:56.536 --> 23:57.868
(groans) Come on.

23:57.870 --> 23:58.869
Hurry up, man.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.070
I'm off meat.

24:00.072 --> 24:02.506
I'm not eating meat anymore.
(camera clicks)

24:03.876 --> 24:04.809
We're good, we're good.

24:04.811 --> 24:07.945
Oh, man! (groans)

24:07.947 --> 24:10.748
STEVE:
<i> What, nothing?</i>

24:10.750 --> 24:12.366
No. No, no, no, no.
Okay, thank you.

24:12.367 --> 24:13.983
Listen, just keep pressing,
all right? Please.

24:13.986 --> 24:16.053
Just keep pressing. All right.

24:16.055 --> 24:18.306
Navarro's meeting

24:18.307 --> 24:20.558
crazy resistance trying to I.D.
the cops that shook down Jorge.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.092
It looks like the police
are closing ranks

24:22.094 --> 24:23.727
to protect each other.
Steve, we only have

24:23.729 --> 24:25.563
two hours until
we need to make the exchange,

24:25.565 --> 24:27.165
and so far we're nowhere.

24:27.166 --> 24:28.766
I know. And if Max doesn't
come up with something soon,

24:28.768 --> 24:30.501
we're never gonna know
who's behind this.

24:30.503 --> 24:31.769
Without the name
of this dirty cop,

24:31.771 --> 24:33.537
we can't even make the ransom.

24:33.539 --> 24:36.474
I got an idea.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.780
I love order.

24:42.782 --> 24:45.549
I like things
in the right place.

24:45.551 --> 24:47.685
Because order
is predictable.

24:47.687 --> 24:50.554
You get to make plans,
know your future.

24:50.556 --> 24:53.858
Mess and anarchy are bad
for business, bad for life.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.526
You...

24:55.528 --> 24:57.194
are like this, Commander.

24:57.196 --> 24:59.663
You are chaos.

25:01.601 --> 25:02.633
You really should meet
my partner.

25:02.635 --> 25:04.068
You guys would get along great.

25:04.070 --> 25:05.903
(chuckles)

25:05.905 --> 25:09.206
I would like very much to see
you back on your little island,

25:09.208 --> 25:11.642
disturbing someone else's
peace of mind.

25:11.644 --> 25:12.710
So...

25:12.712 --> 25:15.679
here's my proposal to you.

25:15.681 --> 25:18.682
Before you go butting heads
with the local police,

25:18.684 --> 25:22.286
let me give you the million
dollars you need for the girl.

25:23.256 --> 25:27.057
Make the exchange,
get on a plane,

25:27.059 --> 25:29.693
and never come back
to Juarez again.

25:29.695 --> 25:32.796
Very generous offer,
Mr. Ramirez.

25:32.798 --> 25:36.133
But you and I both know if
I take that money from you,

25:36.135 --> 25:38.802
I'm gonna get a call from you
at some stage in the future--

25:38.804 --> 25:40.905
might be months,
might even be years from now--

25:40.907 --> 25:45.109
and you're gonna ask me for
something that I can't give you.

25:45.111 --> 25:47.177
(laughs)

25:49.215 --> 25:51.015
As you wish.

25:53.286 --> 25:55.553
Yeah.

25:56.689 --> 25:58.789
Quintanilla.

25:59.759 --> 26:01.191
What?

26:01.193 --> 26:04.562
Detective Quintanilla.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.699
Good-bye, Commander.

26:08.701 --> 26:10.768
<i> Salud.</i>

26:17.009 --> 26:18.609
I'm just gonna say this
for the record.

26:18.610 --> 26:20.210
I don't know what Max is pulling
down, but whatever it is,

26:20.212 --> 26:21.712
he deserves a raise.

26:21.714 --> 26:23.347
You're not
still nauseous, are you?

26:23.349 --> 26:25.349
He couldn't possibly have
anything left in him.

26:25.351 --> 26:26.884
GROVER:
Oh, okay.

26:26.886 --> 26:29.620
At least I didn't keep my eyes
closed the whole time.

26:29.622 --> 26:32.089
(chuckling)
What are you laughing at?

26:32.091 --> 26:33.791
I got to tell you,

26:33.793 --> 26:36.794
of all the stupid, dumb,
ignorant, dangerous ideas

26:36.796 --> 26:39.096
you've had, this is
definitely the dumbest.

26:39.098 --> 26:41.665
Is that right? Is that right? You
got a better dumb idea? Uh-huh.

26:41.667 --> 26:42.833
No.
No, I didn't think so.

26:42.835 --> 26:44.735
Actually, it was my dumb idea.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.370
DANNY:
Can I wait in the car?

26:46.372 --> 26:47.905
No, you can't. Let's go.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.007
(men shouting)

26:50.009 --> 26:50.741
<i> Vamos!</i>

26:50.743 --> 26:51.642
<i> Vamos!</i>

26:52.845 --> 26:54.778
Everybody in the
corner right now!

26:54.780 --> 26:56.747
(shouting in Spanish)

27:02.655 --> 27:04.955
Detective Quintanilla?!

27:04.957 --> 27:06.023
Yes?

27:10.863 --> 27:13.697
Where's the money you took
from Jorge Morales?

27:13.699 --> 27:15.366
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

27:15.368 --> 27:17.635
You sure about that?

27:17.637 --> 27:20.204
Guns don't scare me.

27:20.206 --> 27:21.806
Yeah, right. Turn around.

27:21.807 --> 27:23.407
Hands behind your head.
Interlock your fingers.

27:25.378 --> 27:27.111
(whistles)

27:30.783 --> 27:34.051
(prisoners shouting)

27:34.820 --> 27:37.688
Move. Move!

27:37.690 --> 27:39.790
(shouting continues)

27:42.828 --> 27:45.162
You tell us or you're
going in there with them.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.163
Chin.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.615
CHIN:
Got it.

27:47.616 --> 27:49.066
STEVE: You guys
want a dirty cop?

27:49.068 --> 27:50.234
You wouldn't dare.

27:51.904 --> 27:53.037
STEVE:
Last chance.

27:54.940 --> 27:56.006
Here we go.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.608
QUINTANILLA:
Okay! Okay!

27:57.609 --> 27:59.209
STEVE:
Come on, come on!

27:59.211 --> 28:02.112
Let's go.
Zip it up.

28:02.114 --> 28:04.114
Back.

28:04.116 --> 28:05.783
Let's go.

28:09.121 --> 28:11.422
STEVE: Chin!
You put a wire on Morales.

28:11.424 --> 28:12.823
His home, his cell.

28:12.825 --> 28:13.957
I want those tapes.

28:14.860 --> 28:16.827
What tapes?

28:17.963 --> 28:20.698
Guns don't scare you.
STEVE: Chin.

28:20.700 --> 28:21.031
Chin!

28:21.867 --> 28:23.500
(shouts)

28:23.501 --> 28:25.134
CHIN: Next one will do more
than take off your toenail.

28:26.839 --> 28:28.389
STEVE:
<i> All right, Jorge.</i>

28:28.390 --> 28:29.940
You're gonna walk over there
really calmly, you're gonna hand

28:29.942 --> 28:33.444
them the money, and you're gonna
carry Sara back to the cars.

28:33.446 --> 28:35.245
All right?
Nobody's gonna panic.

28:35.247 --> 28:37.281
We're all gonna get
out of there okay.

28:37.283 --> 28:39.817
We're gonna have your back
the whole time, all right?

28:39.819 --> 28:41.852
Okay.

28:48.761 --> 28:50.761
That area's
really exposed.

28:50.763 --> 28:52.296
I was about to say the same thing.
Yeah.

28:52.298 --> 28:53.964
What other choices
do we have?

28:56.202 --> 28:58.001
Okay.

29:02.842 --> 29:05.843
Listen, I need you to
do something for me.

29:05.845 --> 29:07.911
Sure.

29:07.913 --> 29:09.430
Since you're staying
here with Maria,

29:09.431 --> 29:10.948
I need you to go over
those recordings.

Something that's gonna
prove Jorge's involvement

with the cartels.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.190
Of course.

29:20.192 --> 29:24.027
One way or the other, I'm

32:39.258 --> 32:41.158
They were after Five-O.

I know nothing about this!

32:52.071 --> 32:54.972
The first time I heard about
the kidnapping was when Maria

32:54.974 --> 32:56.473
called me and told me
that Sara had been taken!

32:56.475 --> 32:58.041
I...

32:58.043 --> 33:01.511
I'm telling the truth.

33:01.513 --> 33:03.146
I swear.

33:03.148 --> 33:04.448
Why didn't you tell us?!

33:04.450 --> 33:07.084
(crying): After Sara was taken,
they called me.

33:07.086 --> 33:10.020
They told me to get
ahold of you, Chin,

33:10.022 --> 33:12.322
to get Five-O down here.

33:12.324 --> 33:15.592
They said if I mentioned this
to anyone--

33:15.594 --> 33:19.329
Jorge, the police-- that
they would kill Sara.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.465
What choice
did I have?

33:21.467 --> 33:24.768
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

33:26.638 --> 33:28.638
Maria, you keep
saying "they."

33:28.640 --> 33:29.606
Who's behind this?

33:29.608 --> 33:31.475
I have no idea.

33:31.477 --> 33:33.577
I only ever talked to them
on the phone.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.513
Guys,

33:36.515 --> 33:39.282
I got a call
from Max.

33:39.284 --> 33:41.535
We got I.D. on the tattoo.

33:41.536 --> 33:43.787
The dead kidnapper is a known
member of the Diego cartel.

33:43.789 --> 33:46.156
Oh, my God,
this poor little girl's a pawn.

33:46.158 --> 33:47.674
This whole thing is

33:47.675 --> 33:49.191
nothing but a revenge play.
NAVARRO: Wait, wait, wait.

33:49.194 --> 33:51.161
You guys have dealings
with the Diegos?

33:51.163 --> 33:52.396
Yes.

33:52.398 --> 33:54.531
<i> Caught a case</i>
<i> a couple of months back.</i>

33:54.533 --> 33:56.633
<i> Juan Diego was killed</i>
<i> in a shootout.</i>

33:58.437 --> 34:01.671
Juan Diego's brother, Carlos,
is the head of the cartel.

34:01.673 --> 34:03.373
Okay, this is
blood for blood.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.409
It's called
<i> "Ajuste de cuentas."</i>

34:06.445 --> 34:07.711
CHIN:
We didn't get Sara.

34:07.713 --> 34:09.713
They didn't get their revenge.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.448
Why would they even
keep her alive?

34:11.450 --> 34:13.383
They won't, which means
we need to move right now.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.419
We need to find Carlos Diego,
and we need to take him out.

34:15.421 --> 34:17.554
That's a fine idea
in theory, Steve,

34:17.556 --> 34:20.057
but Carlos's compound is
what we call a black zone.

34:20.059 --> 34:21.525
The military won't even
go in there.

34:21.527 --> 34:23.326
Show me. Show me his compound.

34:23.328 --> 34:25.379
NAVARRO: Setting
aside the risk that

34:25.380 --> 34:27.431
you go in and he's even there,
you still got to get in.

34:27.433 --> 34:30.434
And he's a man who lives
under a million crosshairs.

34:30.436 --> 34:33.437
He's got alarms, motion
sensors, cameras everywhere.

34:33.439 --> 34:35.405
And over 100 military-grade
armed guards.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.507
GROVER: So this guy's
the real Scarface?

34:37.509 --> 34:39.009
STEVE:
I got an audience with Ramirez.

34:39.010 --> 34:40.510
You told me
all about his security, too.

34:40.512 --> 34:42.712
NAVARRO:
Ramirez is a tiger shark.

34:42.714 --> 34:44.548
Carlos-- he's the great white.

34:44.550 --> 34:45.715
Now I'm not saying

34:45.717 --> 34:47.484
it can't be done,

34:47.486 --> 34:49.119
but in my opinion...

34:49.121 --> 34:51.688
That's a suicide mission.

34:52.825 --> 34:54.558
I got to get some air.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.827
Give me it.
Let me see it.

34:56.829 --> 34:58.528
There's one way in
and one way out.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.771
I should've listened to you.

35:09.341 --> 35:11.641
You were right
to be so worried about Sara.

35:11.643 --> 35:13.143
I'm sorry, Chin.

35:13.145 --> 35:15.545
No. Kono, I was wrong.

35:15.547 --> 35:17.747
Turns out that the
biggest threat to Sara

35:17.749 --> 35:20.784
wasn't the Moraleses.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.319
It was me.

35:22.321 --> 35:26.623
It was because of our
dealings with Diego

35:26.625 --> 35:28.258
that Sara was taken.

35:28.260 --> 35:30.327
You can't blame yourself
