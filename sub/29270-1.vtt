01:17.484 --> 01:19.387
[devices powering up]

01:31.497 --> 01:33.466
[Marshall on radio] <i>Convoy's
coming through at 0600.</i>

01:33.600 --> 01:35.768
<i>We need to
secure this area ASAP.</i>

01:35.901 --> 01:37.437
[Riley over radio] <i>Roger that.</i>

01:41.008 --> 01:43.577
[Marshall] This is where the drone
last picked up a heat signature.

01:57.925 --> 01:59.527
[Riley] We got ourselves
a customer.

02:28.321 --> 02:29.756
[sniper exhales]

[exhales]

02:50.878 --> 02:51.946
[Marshall speaks Pashto]

02:52.212 --> 02:53.079
Hmm?

02:54.281 --> 02:55.148
Drop it.

03:02.022 --> 03:03.590
[Riley over radio]
<i>Next time, you're the bait.</i>

03:04.491 --> 03:06.260
Bandit three-four,
area is secure.

03:06.393 --> 03:07.893
<i>Repeat, area is secure.</i>

03:08.027 --> 03:10.030

<i>Roger that. On our way.</i>

03:24.412 --> 03:25.980
[line ringing]

03:28.915 --> 03:30.418
<i>Well, it's about time.</i>

03:30.551 --> 03:31.752
Dad, is it happening?

03:31.885 --> 03:33.154
<i>"Is it happening?"</i>

03:33.788 --> 03:35.088
<i>It's happened.</i>

03:37.057 --> 03:38.091
<i>Hey, you.</i>

03:39.291 --> 03:40.561
Hey, little guy.

03:42.496 --> 03:44.231
Oh, wow.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.101
He's beautiful.

03:48.701 --> 03:49.702
<i>Yeah.</i>

03:49.837 --> 03:51.506
<i>And he's already talking.</i>

03:52.004 --> 03:53.740
Yeah?

03:53.873 --> 03:55.642
<i>I think I heard him say,
"Daddy better get his butt back here</i>

03:55.776 --> 03:57.978
<i>and help Mom
change some diapers."</i>

03:58.111 --> 03:59.279
[laughs]

04:01.015 --> 04:03.017
Soon, baby.
Just three more months.

04:05.686 --> 04:07.354
God, I love you so much.

04:07.487 --> 04:08.622
<i>I love you, too.</i>

04:09.557 --> 04:11.357
- <i>Hi, Marshall!</i>
- <i>Hi, Marshall!</i>

04:11.492 --> 04:13.127
- [woman] <i>We miss you.</i>
- What's going on? Did she have the baby?

04:13.260 --> 04:14.461
Yeah, look. Look.

04:14.593 --> 04:15.628
- No way!
- Yeah.

04:15.762 --> 04:17.798
[Riley] Congratulations, man.

04:18.363 --> 04:19.298
Oh, wow.

04:20.700 --> 04:22.702
Ugly kid. Definitely yours.

04:22.835 --> 04:24.304
[both laugh]

04:37.818 --> 04:39.620
So you think
you're gonna re-enlist?

04:40.820 --> 04:41.888
I don't know.

04:42.890 --> 04:45.058
You think Sophie will
stick around if you do?

04:47.794 --> 04:49.362
I don't know.

04:49.496 --> 04:51.799
Well, what the hell are
you gonna do if you don't?

04:54.601 --> 04:56.003
I get it, you don't know.

04:57.137 --> 04:59.005
[Private Meyers] Sarge! Sarge!

05:00.875 --> 05:03.077
Now I know
where I'd seen you before, sir.

05:03.210 --> 05:06.847
He won the 450 class
at the Loretta Lynn in '15.

05:06.979 --> 05:08.881
Everyone thought
Kurt Walker was gonna take it.

05:09.015 --> 05:10.083
[Riley] Let me see that.

05:11.351 --> 05:12.520
Huh.

05:12.652 --> 05:13.886
That's a good picture.

05:14.020 --> 05:15.788
You've been holding out
on us, Bennett.

05:15.921 --> 05:17.558
[Private Meyers]
Could've gone pro, sir.

05:17.691 --> 05:18.892
What are you doing
here with us?

05:19.025 --> 05:20.193
Uh...

05:20.327 --> 05:21.962
Riding for trophies
didn't really interest me.

05:22.094 --> 05:23.262
Trophies? What about the money?

05:23.397 --> 05:24.296
Yeah, and the girls?

05:24.798 --> 05:26.133
I got a girl.

05:26.267 --> 05:27.267
And the money?

05:27.400 --> 05:28.601
[Marshall sighs]

05:28.734 --> 05:30.104
Look, man,
I always wanted to serve.

05:30.236 --> 05:31.837
When I found out
I could ride for the Rangers,

05:31.972 --> 05:33.106
I knew that's
what I wanted to do.

05:33.239 --> 05:34.741
[Riley] Oh, no,
I mean, I get it.

05:34.875 --> 05:36.543
I turned down
a real high-paying job, too.

05:36.676 --> 05:38.445
Taco Bell, management track.

05:38.578 --> 05:40.013
[all laughing]

05:59.933 --> 06:02.068
We wiped this place out
months ago.

06:02.202 --> 06:04.639
Satellite's showing
intermittent activity again.

06:08.275 --> 06:09.210
You smell that?

06:10.811 --> 06:11.811
I do.

06:11.945 --> 06:13.314
Somebody's making lunch.

06:17.116 --> 06:19.854
Bandit three-two, on target,
securing the objective.

06:20.887 --> 06:22.023
Let's move out.

06:51.952 --> 06:53.020
[exhales]

06:53.719 --> 06:54.921
[creaking]

06:58.592 --> 06:59.827
Riley!

07:01.594 --> 07:02.897
[speaking other language]

07:07.368 --> 07:10.004
- [groans]
- [in English] Riley! Stay down!

07:11.839 --> 07:13.106
[speaking other language]

07:19.044 --> 07:19.945
[in English] Shit!

07:20.080 --> 07:21.248
[speaking other language]

07:23.217 --> 07:25.118
[Marshall in English]
Riley, stay down!

07:25.251 --> 07:26.319
[speaking other language]

07:27.921 --> 07:29.490
[Riley groaning]

07:29.623 --> 07:31.058
[Marshall in English] Stay down, Riley.
Hang in there.

07:31.191 --> 07:32.625
- [speaking other language]
- [cocks gun]

07:32.760 --> 07:34.260
[in English] Bandit three-two,
this is Alpha two-five.

07:34.394 --> 07:35.495
We have an eagle down.
Repeat, eagle down.

07:35.628 --> 07:36.463
[speaking other language]

07:38.498 --> 07:39.366
[grunts]

07:40.933 --> 07:43.035
[speaking other language]

07:43.169 --> 07:44.705
[in English] Under enemy fire
at target location.

07:44.837 --> 07:46.873
Launch QRF! Repeat, launch QRF!

07:47.007 --> 07:50.077
[pilot] <i>Roger, Alpha two-five.
QRF launched. Hold tight.</i>

07:53.513 --> 07:54.713
[speaking other language]

07:54.847 --> 07:56.049
[soldiers coughing]

07:58.786 --> 08:00.553
[in English]
You all right? You okay?

08:00.686 --> 08:02.823
- Yeah.
- Come on. Come on.

08:05.726 --> 08:06.794
[groans]

08:09.029 --> 08:10.097
[speaking other language]

08:12.733 --> 08:13.867
[Riley moans]

08:14.000 --> 08:14.835
[in English]
Come on, Riley, hang on!

08:17.971 --> 08:19.840
All right, almost there!
You're gonna make it!

08:29.315 --> 08:30.183
[grunts]

08:47.733 --> 08:49.335
[monitors beeping]

08:54.341 --> 08:55.442
[Marshall] Mmm.

08:55.574 --> 08:56.576
[doctor muffled]
How are you feeling, Sergeant?

08:57.544 --> 08:58.412
[clearly] Sergeant?

09:01.347 --> 09:02.315
Riley.

09:03.516 --> 09:04.484
Where's Riley?

09:06.720 --> 09:07.688
He's in surgery.

09:07.821 --> 09:09.255
He has been all night.

09:09.389 --> 09:12.459
They're doing everything
they can for him, but...

09:13.726 --> 09:15.029
to be frank,

09:16.563 --> 09:17.865
it doesn't look good.

09:20.266 --> 09:23.136
There's something else
I need to talk to you about.

09:23.270 --> 09:25.606
Now, we were able
to save your leg,

09:25.739 --> 09:29.042
but you have multiple fractures
in your foot.

09:29.174 --> 09:31.745
And there's no way to know
if it will heal properly.

09:31.877 --> 09:33.347
Therefore, I'm recommending

09:33.480 --> 09:35.882
subtalar fusion of
your heel bone.

09:36.015 --> 09:37.483
It's the only way to guarantee

09:37.616 --> 09:40.020
that you'll ever be able
to walk again without pain.

09:41.621 --> 09:42.856
But?

09:42.990 --> 09:45.993
But, it will limit movement
in your ankle,

09:46.125 --> 09:48.062
and you wouldn't be able
to ride the same way.

09:48.194 --> 09:49.262
- No, thanks.
- [doctor] Which...

09:50.496 --> 09:54.068
Which is something
I would discourage in any case.

09:55.369 --> 09:58.939
Maybe you should take
some time to think about it.

09:59.606 --> 10:01.008
I don't need to.

10:01.140 --> 10:02.409
I'll take my chances.

10:02.542 --> 10:03.810
I don't think you understand
the full extent

10:03.943 --> 10:06.078
of your injuries, Sergeant.

10:06.578 --> 10:08.015
Even if it heals,

10:08.148 --> 10:12.519
with the rod in your back and
the screws in your leg, son,

10:12.653 --> 10:14.654
you're done riding
for the Army.

10:16.289 --> 10:18.491
I'm recommending
a medical discharge.

10:19.625 --> 10:20.660
I'm sorry.

11:07.073 --> 11:08.942
[Cyrus] Bennett, the KX ready?

11:09.074 --> 11:10.476
Yeah, just about done.

11:23.155 --> 11:25.657
[grunting]

11:25.792 --> 11:28.027
Dude! Dude, dude, dude!
Let me help you with this thing.

11:28.160 --> 11:30.029
I had it. It's fine.

11:30.164 --> 11:32.499
Dude, if you get hurt in my shop,
Sophie will beat me like a pinata,

11:32.632 --> 11:34.900
and I will cry, man.
I'm a crier.

11:35.034 --> 11:36.469
- It's embarrassing.
- Okay.

11:51.452 --> 11:53.654
[rock music
playing over stereo]

11:58.558 --> 11:59.926
[Cyrus] Hey, you know
who that is?

12:00.059 --> 12:01.127
I'm telling you,
I'll be twice as fast.

12:02.127 --> 12:03.597
[Cyrus] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:03.730 --> 12:05.566
- You okay?
- Yeah. I just don't even feel it.

12:06.299 --> 12:08.935
- Nothing at all?
- No.

12:09.068 --> 12:10.969
Doctor's not sure
if I ever will.

12:11.103 --> 12:13.073
Just gotta keep doing the PT.

12:13.939 --> 12:15.275
Who's this guy?

12:15.408 --> 12:17.342
That's Kurt Walker's
little brother, Chris.

12:17.476 --> 12:19.346
- He's racing now, too.
- [Marshall] Oh, yeah?

12:20.246 --> 12:21.548
He any good?

12:21.682 --> 12:24.451
Uh, he's got
a small sponsorship,

12:24.584 --> 12:26.752
- from my cousin, actually.
- [Marshall] Hmm.

12:26.885 --> 12:29.522
[Cyrus] He's gonna be racing
his qualifier this year.

12:29.655 --> 12:31.623
He's nowhere as fast
as you were at his age,

12:31.757 --> 12:33.026
I'll tell you that much.

12:37.063 --> 12:38.432
All right, let's go, babe.

12:42.068 --> 12:44.404
I'm gonna get a jump
on that 650.

12:47.307 --> 12:48.707
- You good, bud?
- Yeah, man.

12:48.841 --> 12:49.808
- All right, man. Thank you...
- See you tomorrow.

12:49.942 --> 12:50.677
...for a hard day.

12:59.184 --> 13:00.853
- Marshall, wait.
- Sophie, I got it.

13:00.986 --> 13:02.154
- No, no, no, no.
- It's okay.

13:02.289 --> 13:04.124
- Baby.
- I got it. Stop.

13:05.525 --> 13:06.393
Go.

13:07.025 --> 13:07.926
Gimme.

13:08.060 --> 13:09.228
- Thank you.
- Yep.

13:15.735 --> 13:16.603
Got it?

13:18.337 --> 13:19.405
[Sophie exhales]

13:22.208 --> 13:24.143
- Sophie.
- Cyrus.

13:40.092 --> 13:41.627
[cows mooing]

13:54.941 --> 13:55.809
You good?

13:57.276 --> 13:58.610
[dog barking in distance]

13:58.745 --> 14:00.147
Got it?

14:00.279 --> 14:02.848
Why don't you just let me
help you inside?

14:02.982 --> 14:04.183
Are you sure?

14:04.650 --> 14:05.818
Okay, whatever.

14:05.952 --> 14:07.520
- [Cal] Hey.
- Hey, Dad.

14:07.654 --> 14:09.423
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, buddy.

14:09.555 --> 14:11.256
- [Marshall] How's he doing?
- Ah, he's doing great.

14:11.390 --> 14:13.125
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I've got him talking.

14:13.260 --> 14:14.660
What's this? What's this?

14:14.794 --> 14:17.363
- Tractor.
- Tractor. Did you hear him?

14:17.497 --> 14:18.864
- Did you hear him?
- It is a tractor.

14:18.997 --> 14:20.566
- [Cal] That's right, buddy.
- Nice job, buddy.

14:20.699 --> 14:22.501
[Sophie] Where's Daddy been?

14:22.635 --> 14:23.837
- Harley?
- Want to say hi to Daddy?

14:23.970 --> 14:25.572
- [Cal] You wanna go to your dad?
- Harley.

14:25.704 --> 14:27.406
- [Sophie] Hey, be careful.
- Come here. It's okay.

14:27.540 --> 14:29.475
- You all right? Okay.
- Yeah, I'm good.

14:29.608 --> 14:31.677
- Hey.
- [Cal] All right.

14:33.011 --> 14:35.047
See the little puppy. Yeah?

14:35.182 --> 14:36.149
- Yeah, who's that?
- Harley!

14:36.283 --> 14:37.717
- Steady, bud.
- Harley!

14:37.851 --> 14:39.052
Harley?

14:39.184 --> 14:40.986
All right. I feel like that's...

14:41.121 --> 14:42.588
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I got him. I got him.

14:42.722 --> 14:43.590
He's too heavy.

14:44.790 --> 14:46.258
[Cal] He's been good.
How you doing?

14:46.393 --> 14:47.694
- You know.
- [Cal] Yeah.

14:47.827 --> 14:49.897
- Another day.
- [Sophie] Where's he going?

14:53.533 --> 14:55.269
[cutlery clacking]

14:56.770 --> 14:58.639
[Sophie] Please try
some of these for me, please.

15:02.375 --> 15:03.476
Just a little bit.

15:05.645 --> 15:06.914
Come on, please, just some...

15:08.747 --> 15:10.215
Is there any parmesan left?

15:10.350 --> 15:11.384
Stop, sit down, I got it.

15:11.518 --> 15:12.886
- Sophie, I can...
- I got it.

15:14.553 --> 15:16.456
Hey, bud. It's okay.

15:17.289 --> 15:19.259
Did you hear from the VA yet?

15:19.858 --> 15:20.927
Thank you.

15:21.060 --> 15:23.829
Same as last time,
it's being processed.

15:23.962 --> 15:25.866
Cal, I swear,
when he finally does start

15:25.999 --> 15:27.233
to get his disability,

15:27.366 --> 15:29.535
we will be able to
help out a lot more.

15:29.669 --> 15:31.036
Well, if this drought
doesn't break,

15:31.170 --> 15:32.472
it's not gonna matter anyway.

15:32.605 --> 15:34.640
Price of feed went up again.

15:38.343 --> 15:39.645
Well, what are you gonna do?

15:40.212 --> 15:41.280
Nothing to do.

15:41.414 --> 15:42.783
We gotta have the organic feed

15:42.915 --> 15:45.484
to keep the organic status
for the dairy, so...

15:46.251 --> 15:47.285
I might have to
lay more guys off

15:47.419 --> 15:48.654
and get up earlier.

15:54.026 --> 15:55.261
[Marshall] Heard you
coming in late last night.

15:55.395 --> 15:56.629
Is something going on?

15:56.763 --> 15:58.999
Had to replace the pump
on the bulk tank.

15:59.131 --> 16:00.000
Oh, yeah?

16:01.134 --> 16:02.335
Well, you need a hand?

16:02.467 --> 16:04.136
- Babe.
- Sophie, come on.

16:04.270 --> 16:06.405
Sitting on a stool fixing
motorcycles, I agreed to that.

16:06.539 --> 16:08.106
I don't want you on a catwalk.

16:08.241 --> 16:09.475
- Son, it's not...
- No, it's fine.

16:09.608 --> 16:10.742
I'm just gonna be
another set of eyes.

16:10.876 --> 16:12.346
- It's okay.
- Don't bullshit me.

16:12.478 --> 16:14.046
We both know you'll be up there
in two minutes.

16:14.179 --> 16:16.515
Sophie, I've gotta stay active.
I can't just be sitting around

16:16.650 --> 16:18.784
- all day.
- No unnecessary risks!

16:18.918 --> 16:19.986
End of discussion.

16:29.395 --> 16:30.863
I just feel like maybe we can
talk about it sometimes...

16:30.996 --> 16:33.332
I need to get ready for class.
Thank you.

16:50.049 --> 16:52.084
[Cal] I'm going outside
for a bit, Marshall.

16:52.217 --> 16:53.084
Okay, Dad.

16:53.218 --> 16:54.219
[crying]

16:54.353 --> 16:56.022
It's okay. It's okay, come on.

17:03.663 --> 17:05.031
[switch clicking]

17:05.165 --> 17:06.366
[sighs]

17:07.934 --> 17:08.867
[sighs]

17:09.002 --> 17:10.569
Okay, buddy.
Want to go to sleep?

17:21.281 --> 17:22.816
[grunting]

17:46.505 --> 17:48.408
[panting]

17:55.180 --> 17:56.515
[grunting]

18:04.290 --> 18:05.592
[thudding]

18:06.892 --> 18:07.760
Marshall?

18:09.461 --> 18:10.996
[groaning]

18:14.601 --> 18:16.636
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, fine.

18:17.402 --> 18:19.005
- Are you hurt?
- No.

18:19.139 --> 18:20.439
- You sure?
- Yeah.

18:20.573 --> 18:22.341
You need to go to the ER
and get checked out?

18:22.475 --> 18:23.810
I'm fine, Dad. It's just, I...

18:23.942 --> 18:28.079
I just... I couldn't
get the light fixed.

18:28.214 --> 18:30.283
- It's just gonna take some time, bud.
- [crying]

18:30.416 --> 18:31.518
It's just gonna take some time.

18:31.650 --> 18:33.151
Hey, hey, hey...

18:33.785 --> 18:35.487
It's all right, buddy.

18:35.621 --> 18:37.623
- [Marshall] I just can't get the light.
- [Cal] It's okay.

18:38.323 --> 18:39.458
[Marshall sobbing]

18:39.592 --> 18:40.794
It's just gonna
take some time, son.

18:40.927 --> 18:42.528
[Marshall]
Just can't get the light.

18:42.661 --> 18:44.029
[continues sobbing]

18:53.639 --> 18:54.975
[aerosol spraying]

19:04.650 --> 19:06.085
[car approaching]

19:08.888 --> 19:11.158
Yo, Bennett,
are you done with the KTM yet?

19:12.257 --> 19:13.259
Why didn't you call me?

19:13.392 --> 19:14.360
I got it.

19:14.493 --> 19:15.662
What's for lunch?

19:18.598 --> 19:20.801
[rock music
playing over speakers]

19:22.869 --> 19:24.270
You ever find it weird

19:24.402 --> 19:26.237
you were halfway across
the world shooting at Arabs

19:26.371 --> 19:28.041
and now you work for one?

19:28.175 --> 19:29.775
You think you might have ran
into some of my relatives

19:29.909 --> 19:30.944
while you were over there?

19:31.076 --> 19:32.077
You're an idiot.

19:32.210 --> 19:33.746
No, seriously, my cousin,
Makhmoud,

19:33.880 --> 19:35.748
haven't heard from him
for a while.

19:35.881 --> 19:38.284
You think you shot a guy by
the name of Makhmoud by chance?

19:38.417 --> 19:42.155
You know, unibrow, big nose,
kinda chubby belly?

19:42.288 --> 19:45.023
He only dabbled in terrorism,
so he's probably not worth your while,

19:45.157 --> 19:47.461
but maybe you can make
a call or something.

19:48.628 --> 19:49.963
Now, I know you think
us cornbread white boys

19:50.095 --> 19:51.763
don't know anything
about geography,

19:51.897 --> 19:53.131
but your family's from Iran.

19:53.265 --> 19:55.034
And that makes you Persian,
not Arab.

19:55.168 --> 19:58.371
And since Iran's part of Asia,
you're actually Asian.

19:58.504 --> 20:00.707
Now I know why
I love the ponzu sauce.

20:02.542 --> 20:04.244
Listen, man,
I just wanna say thanks.

20:04.544 --> 20:05.579
For what?

20:06.111 --> 20:07.713
Giving me work.

20:07.846 --> 20:10.349
You know, things are slow around
here, you don't really need me.

20:10.984 --> 20:12.351
It ain't all charity, kid.

20:12.485 --> 20:14.520
You rebuild engines
faster than anyone I know,

20:14.653 --> 20:16.755
and since I pay you
by the hour,

20:16.889 --> 20:18.925
- it kinda works out for me.
- Yeah. Okay.

20:22.728 --> 20:24.230
Your leg's feeling better, huh?

20:25.098 --> 20:25.966
Getting there.

20:28.100 --> 20:30.703
You ever thought
about instructing?

20:30.835 --> 20:33.205
You could charge
100, 150 bucks an hour.

20:33.340 --> 20:34.974
- Little more than I pay you.
- "Little"?

20:35.107 --> 20:37.043
Kids would love to
learn from you.

20:39.478 --> 20:42.280
There's so many guys doing it,
I couldn't get anybody interested.

20:42.415 --> 20:44.216
Are you nuts?

20:44.350 --> 20:46.284
People see you out on the track
again, the way you used to ride?

20:46.752 --> 20:47.854
[Cyrus chuckles]

20:47.986 --> 20:49.688
That's easier said
than done, man.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.725
[motorbike approaching]

20:57.496 --> 20:58.363
[man] Whoo!

20:59.165 --> 21:01.167
We might be
closing early tonight.

21:01.301 --> 21:02.435
Why?

21:02.569 --> 21:03.903
Because it's Chris
and my cousin,

21:04.036 --> 21:07.039
Amir Pasha Abula
Gharahasanloo Roghieh,

21:07.172 --> 21:09.007
but he goes by "Tony Panterra."

21:09.842 --> 21:11.409
He's not here
just to say hi to me.

21:11.544 --> 21:12.512
Is there bad blood?

21:12.644 --> 21:14.079
[Cyrus] Mmm.

21:14.214 --> 21:15.982
I used to run his race team
when we were younger,

21:16.114 --> 21:18.150
but he was a bit of a hothead.
He kept getting into fights,

21:18.284 --> 21:20.887
and... let's just say,
it didn't end well.

21:21.621 --> 21:23.089
Now, he runs his own race team.

21:23.221 --> 21:25.324
And when it comes to bikes,
he likes to spend money,

21:25.457 --> 21:27.092
so... smile.

21:30.063 --> 21:32.631
So this is where dreams
come to die, huh?

21:33.466 --> 21:35.568
Tony. Pleasant as ever.

21:35.700 --> 21:36.969
Cyrus.

21:37.102 --> 21:40.573
Still the, uh,
delicate flower, I see?

21:40.706 --> 21:41.873
[Kurt] Pig didn't
stand a chance.

21:42.007 --> 21:43.976
He still had his Big Mac
in his hands.

21:49.548 --> 21:50.616
Bennett.

21:51.284 --> 21:52.986
Hey, Kurt.

21:53.119 --> 21:56.255
This guy used to give me a hell
of a hard time on the track.

21:56.389 --> 21:58.290
- [Chris] I remember.
- Congrats on all your success, man.

21:58.423 --> 22:02.093
Thank you.
Yeah, I heard you, uh, joined up.

22:02.561 --> 22:04.096
I was surprised.

22:04.229 --> 22:07.098
But, uh...
hey, you made it back in one piece.

22:07.233 --> 22:09.101
So that's good.
It's good to see you.

22:09.235 --> 22:11.370
So, what can I
help you guys with?

22:11.504 --> 22:13.305
Need an A-kit for a KX.

22:13.438 --> 22:16.207
- Front and rear?
- What do you think?

22:16.342 --> 22:19.312
Okay. Got a KYB kit right here.
Follow me.

22:27.320 --> 22:29.956
[Chris] I'm all out, third
gear, break for the jump,

22:30.089 --> 22:31.658
then I cut tight for that left.

22:31.791 --> 22:33.659
[Kurt] They're always
catching you in this section.

22:33.792 --> 22:35.160
I think you're getting too
much air coming up Mt. Whitney.

22:35.294 --> 22:36.362
No, I'm not.

22:36.496 --> 22:37.862
[Kurt] Yes, you are.
This ain't X Games.

22:37.996 --> 22:39.398
You gotta stay low.

22:39.531 --> 22:41.101
[Chris] You gotta
entertain the crowd a little.

22:41.234 --> 22:42.702
[Kurt] I know it makes you feel
like a superhero,

22:42.834 --> 22:44.069
but it's actually
just losing you time.

22:44.204 --> 22:45.705
- [Chris] Yeah, yeah.
- With the install,

22:45.839 --> 22:47.340
it's gonna be an $8,000 sale.

22:47.474 --> 22:49.175
- Oh, nice.
- [Tony] Keep the tires on the ground.

22:49.309 --> 22:50.377
That's how you go fast.

22:50.509 --> 22:52.544
Listen to your brother,
dipshit. He's a pro.

22:52.678 --> 22:54.280
[Kurt] Yeah, and you're having
to brake too hard,

22:54.413 --> 22:56.281
and then, also, you're
taking that turn too late

22:56.416 --> 22:58.184
when you're coming off
the left handy.

22:58.316 --> 23:00.352
You just have to make sure that
you take it nice and tight.

23:00.486 --> 23:01.854
[Chris] Yeah, yeah, I got it.

23:01.987 --> 23:03.355
Hey, you know, if you go wide
and turn in late

23:03.488 --> 23:04.590
to that left-hander,
you gain ten miles an hour

23:04.724 --> 23:05.692
coming out of the chicane.

23:07.325 --> 23:09.028
Yeah, but then you're leaving
your inside open.

23:10.129 --> 23:11.531
Well, yeah, it's a risky move.

23:11.663 --> 23:13.132
A dumb move, if you ask me.

23:13.265 --> 23:15.234
So, if you guys
drop your bike off tomorrow,

23:15.368 --> 23:17.904
I can have it for you
by this weekend.

23:18.036 --> 23:19.404
Hey, you know,
if it's just one guy behind,

23:19.538 --> 23:21.206
just let him right by, right?

23:21.341 --> 23:22.842
Then you cut in late,
power out,

23:22.975 --> 23:24.944
and shoot right past him
before the next turn.

23:25.711 --> 23:27.512
[Kurt] Look, Bennett, thanks,

23:27.647 --> 23:30.015
but, uh, I'm trying not to get
Chris' racing lines all mixed up.

23:30.150 --> 23:31.350
Yeah, I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry.

23:31.484 --> 23:32.818
It's just I did all right

23:32.951 --> 23:34.353
on that track.
I'm just trying to help.

23:35.121 --> 23:36.889
Yeah, no offense, Bennett,

23:37.023 --> 23:40.760
but, uh, like you said,
it's been a while.

23:42.061 --> 23:43.929
I think what Marshall's
trying to say is that

23:44.063 --> 23:46.198
he laid down the fastest
lap times in every race,

23:46.332 --> 23:47.734
so he kinda knows
what he's talking about.

23:47.867 --> 23:49.335
Yeah, but Kurt did it as a pro.

23:49.468 --> 23:50.902
- All season.
- Pro or not, a good line...

23:51.036 --> 23:52.804
- Cyrus, it's okay, man.
- No, no, come on.

23:52.938 --> 23:54.806
Pro or not, a good line
is a good line.

23:54.940 --> 23:56.074
You listen to Marshall,

23:56.208 --> 23:57.476
you might shave off
some more time.

23:57.610 --> 23:59.212
- [laughing] Okay.
- I'll tell you what...

23:59.344 --> 24:00.345
um...

24:00.478 --> 24:01.747
hang on to that A-kit
for a minute,

24:01.880 --> 24:03.482
and I'll get back with you.

24:03.615 --> 24:04.683
All right, come on, guys.

24:04.816 --> 24:05.884
Yeah.

24:06.651 --> 24:08.121
[Tony] Ladies, we're out.

24:09.221 --> 24:10.522
You didn't have to do that,
man.

24:10.656 --> 24:12.959
- [motorbike engines starting]
- Screw them.

24:22.802 --> 24:23.635
You ready?

24:23.768 --> 24:24.603
[gasps]

24:24.736 --> 24:25.871
Who's that?

24:27.372 --> 24:28.239
Who's that?

24:29.207 --> 24:31.576
So I was watching
this teacher the other day,

24:31.709 --> 24:34.780
she was completely oblivious
to what this horse was doing.

24:34.913 --> 24:36.314
It was exactly
what you showed me.

24:36.448 --> 24:39.518
His ears were flickering
back and forth.

24:39.651 --> 24:41.853
I told you there are things you're
not gonna learn in vet school.

24:41.987 --> 24:45.123
[Sophie] Yeah, well, the horse was
obviously bothered by something.

24:45.256 --> 24:46.592
[in child-like voice]
Mommy thinks that it's because

24:46.726 --> 24:49.094
his assistant doesn't shower,

24:49.227 --> 24:50.529
and then he's stinky.

24:50.662 --> 24:52.130
He's stinky.

24:52.264 --> 24:53.733
You need a shower.
You need a shower.

24:53.865 --> 24:54.967
You're quite a stinky.

24:55.100 --> 24:56.436
You're quite a stinky!

24:57.970 --> 24:59.238
[in normal voice]
You want a shower?

24:59.371 --> 25:01.106
I know, it's time for a shower.

25:03.942 --> 25:06.512
Come on, let's go upstairs.
Say good night.

25:08.915 --> 25:10.316
[Marshall] Go to sleep, okay?

25:11.284 --> 25:12.418
- Shh.
- [door closing]

25:24.830 --> 25:25.999
[ratchet turning]

25:27.365 --> 25:29.768
All right, that's the last one.

25:29.901 --> 25:30.969
All right.

25:33.371 --> 25:36.175
Okay, set that one down,
all right?

25:36.307 --> 25:38.844
Yeah, here's the leak.
I need that crescent there.

25:38.977 --> 25:40.045
All right.

25:41.514 --> 25:42.581
All right.

25:42.715 --> 25:44.316
Okay, can you hold this?

25:44.449 --> 25:45.651
- Right here?
- [Cal] Yeah, right there.

25:45.784 --> 25:46.619
- You got it?
- Yeah, go ahead.

25:46.752 --> 25:47.821
[Cal] Okay.

25:53.926 --> 25:55.528
What's gnawing at you, boy?

25:58.197 --> 26:00.366
Kurt Walker came
in the shop today.

26:00.498 --> 26:02.134
- Oh.
- Yeah.

26:05.571 --> 26:06.539
What about you?

26:09.073 --> 26:11.110
I'm gonna have to
sell this thing.

26:12.245 --> 26:13.713
What the hell are you gonna do
without this?

26:13.845 --> 26:17.115
Not gonna matter soon.
I'm behind on the mortgage.

26:20.152 --> 26:21.754
Why didn't you
say anything, Dad?

26:22.121 --> 26:23.255
How much?

26:23.389 --> 26:24.256
Uh...

26:25.257 --> 26:27.025
Just a little over five grand.

26:29.661 --> 26:31.331
Yeah, okay, well...

26:33.465 --> 26:35.067
I mean,
Sophie and I have at least

26:35.199 --> 26:37.269
- two in savings.
- Yeah, well, you just keep it.

26:37.402 --> 26:40.472
If it don't rain,
it's just gonna keep adding up.

26:41.640 --> 26:42.507
[Cal sighs]

26:43.743 --> 26:45.644
I wanted to leave this place
to you guys.

26:45.777 --> 26:47.345
No, it's okay, Dad. It's...

26:47.478 --> 26:50.082
It's not all right, Marshall.
It's not all right with me.

26:50.916 --> 26:52.385
Argh! Oh.

26:52.651 --> 26:53.718
God!

26:53.852 --> 26:55.587
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- [groans]

26:55.721 --> 26:57.889
- Grease on my hand.
- Yeah, it's okay.

26:58.024 --> 26:59.225
[Cal] No, no.

27:00.059 --> 27:01.726
Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.

27:01.860 --> 27:03.161
Don't look broke.

27:04.162 --> 27:05.564
Oh, that hurts. Argh...

27:07.832 --> 27:09.134
[laughing]

27:11.838 --> 27:14.007
- It hurts, Dad.
- It hurt.

27:14.840 --> 27:16.775
See? Yeah.

27:16.909 --> 27:18.477
It's just gonna take some time.

27:21.613 --> 27:24.284
Well, hey. Hey, we're tired,
and we're getting sloppy,

27:24.417 --> 27:26.552
so I think it's time
we call it a night,

27:26.685 --> 27:29.489
and we'll talk about this
some more tomorrow.

27:29.621 --> 27:30.555
- Yeah.
- All right.

27:30.689 --> 27:31.658
I'll clean up.

27:33.226 --> 27:35.459
- You sure?
- Yeah. Yeah.

27:35.593 --> 27:38.063
Just check on Ray-Ray
for me, please.

27:39.332 --> 27:40.498
- Will do.
- Okay.

27:40.632 --> 27:42.934
- It hurts.
- [laughing] It hurts.

27:43.067 --> 27:45.470
- Night, son.
- Good night, Dad.

27:47.072 --> 27:48.107
Ah...

27:48.673 --> 27:50.676
[barn door closes]

28:41.092 --> 28:42.361
[kicker clicks]

28:44.028 --> 28:45.163
[exhales]

28:50.602 --> 28:51.637
[groans]

29:16.896 --> 29:18.598
[engine sputtering]

29:23.701 --> 29:24.703
[engine revving]

29:28.073 --> 29:30.043
[engine revving]

29:35.848 --> 29:37.417
Oh, hell.

29:43.956 --> 29:45.224
Okay.

29:48.159 --> 29:49.361
Here we go.

30:02.340 --> 30:03.509
Come on, come on.

30:05.244 --> 30:06.312
Whoo!

30:08.246 --> 30:09.348
Whoo!

30:36.374 --> 30:38.310
Where is he?

30:39.044 --> 30:40.412
- [gasps]
- Shh.

30:41.647 --> 30:44.417
- [laughing]
- You suck. That is not funny.

30:45.217 --> 30:46.084
Oh.

30:46.485 --> 30:48.419
- Hey.
- Hi.

30:48.553 --> 30:50.722
It's been a minute
since you've waited up for me.

30:50.855 --> 30:52.090
I know.

30:52.225 --> 30:53.559
Babe, no, no, no,
your leg, your leg.

30:53.692 --> 30:55.159
It can handle you,
woman. It's fine.

30:55.294 --> 30:58.163
I packed on a couple pounds
since Ray-Ray.

30:58.296 --> 30:59.930
- Yeah, you're right, you have.
- [scoffs]

31:00.064 --> 31:02.234
- That is rude.
- We'll have to work it off somehow.

31:02.367 --> 31:03.169
[Sophie] Oh, yeah?

31:03.302 --> 31:04.370
[exclaims]

31:04.969 --> 31:05.904
Okay.

31:07.171 --> 31:09.240
What has gotten into you?

31:09.373 --> 31:11.643
- I'll tell you tomorrow.
- Okay.

31:12.977 --> 31:14.145
Instruct?

31:14.280 --> 31:15.681
So you want to get on a bike?

31:15.813 --> 31:17.582
I'd just be riding around
with little kids, baby.

31:17.716 --> 31:20.284
But this is a risk
that we don't need to take.

31:20.418 --> 31:21.687
We need the money.

31:22.454 --> 31:23.589
We're fine, Marshall.

31:23.723 --> 31:25.657
I really do not
have time for this.

31:25.791 --> 31:28.160
Sophie, Dad's behind
on the mortgage.

31:30.329 --> 31:31.897
What are you talking about?

31:32.030 --> 31:33.532
This is just a part-time job.
It's a few sessions a week.

31:33.666 --> 31:35.067
It'll get us
a lot of extra cash.

31:35.200 --> 31:36.468
No. Absolutely not.

31:36.601 --> 31:37.835
I will go back to work
at the clinic.

31:37.968 --> 31:39.604
And stop school?

31:39.737 --> 31:41.172
- Who would take care of Ray-Ray?
- We will get a nanny.

31:41.306 --> 31:42.540
- It's fine.
- So then you'd be working

31:42.675 --> 31:44.143
to pay someone else
to raise our son.

31:44.276 --> 31:45.678
You'd end up
stuck at the clinic,

31:45.811 --> 31:47.980
I'd end up stuck fixing bikes,
and that'll be it.

31:48.613 --> 31:49.847
I want more for us, baby.

31:49.982 --> 31:51.450
I want you to have
your own clinic one day.

31:51.582 --> 31:52.851
Do you not remember
when the doctor said

31:52.985 --> 31:55.221
"one bad fall," Marshall?
One bad fall,

31:55.353 --> 31:56.554
and you could never walk again.

31:56.688 --> 31:58.157
Sophie, a car accident
could do that,

31:58.290 --> 32:00.026
- but I drive every day, don't I?
- I swear to you,

32:00.159 --> 32:01.893
if I see you on that bike,
I will take our son

32:02.026 --> 32:03.661
and I'll move back to Illinois
with my mom.

32:03.795 --> 32:05.330
- I promise.
- [Marshall] Sophie. Come on, babe.

32:05.464 --> 32:07.466
[Sophie] Don't be late
for physical therapy.

32:08.700 --> 32:09.634
[sighs]

32:51.043 --> 32:51.910
[grunting]

32:55.280 --> 32:56.349
[groans]

33:09.995 --> 33:12.698
Cyrus, I need you to come by tonight
after Sophie leaves for school.

33:12.831 --> 33:14.667
- For what?
- Need you to pick up my bike.

33:14.800 --> 33:17.101
I'm headed to the track
Saturday, find some customers.

33:17.236 --> 33:18.736
That's a horrible idea.

33:19.571 --> 33:20.906
What time you want me
to be there?

33:57.976 --> 33:59.111
Well, this sucks.

33:59.245 --> 34:01.013
Can't believe no one's
at the practice track.

34:03.614 --> 34:05.583
But the REM track sure is busy.

34:05.717 --> 34:06.884
[man 1] That feel all right?

34:07.018 --> 34:08.621
[man 2] Yeah,
go down two clicks.

34:10.353 --> 34:11.657
I'm gonna go sign in.

34:13.757 --> 34:14.958
[man 3] Let's go race!

34:15.092 --> 34:16.594
Everybody down now!

34:16.728 --> 34:18.630
- [man 1] Hey, Jimmy, wait up!
- [man 4] Hurry up, dude!

34:19.898 --> 34:22.501
[man 1] Let's go! Let's go!

34:22.635 --> 34:24.034
[REM announcer in Australian
accent] Happy Saturday, folks,

34:24.168 --> 34:26.204
and welcome to
another REM race event

34:26.338 --> 34:28.039
at Glen Helen Raceway.

34:28.172 --> 34:31.409
Only ten minutes left in this
morning's practice session.

34:34.380 --> 34:35.581
Let's check it out.

34:49.829 --> 34:52.630
It's kind of busy
for a local race, right?

34:52.764 --> 34:54.599
I haven't seen it like this
in a while.

34:57.135 --> 34:58.970
Hey, Forrest! Forrest!

34:59.738 --> 35:01.405
- Hey.
- Hey, man, how you doing?

35:01.539 --> 35:03.876
Doing good. It's a great turnout today.
What's going on?

35:04.008 --> 35:07.579
Kurt Walker tweeted to everybody
that he's gonna be here today.

35:09.648 --> 35:11.015
[Cyrus] Is he racing?

35:11.148 --> 35:12.450
[Forrest] No, but
his little brother Chris is.

35:13.552 --> 35:14.785
And everybody wants in to see

35:14.919 --> 35:17.289
if they can outrun
the new rising star.

35:17.423 --> 35:19.825
Purse is up to
four grand today.

35:21.526 --> 35:22.894
Do you think
anyone's fast enough?

35:23.028 --> 35:25.731
Nah, nobody's gonna outrun
the Walker brothers.

35:25.863 --> 35:27.698
I don't even like
those entitled pricks.

35:28.066 --> 35:29.001
[chuckles]

35:29.135 --> 35:31.503
But they bring in
a hell of a crowd.

35:31.635 --> 35:33.470
Hey, man, I gotta go.
See ya later.

35:33.604 --> 35:34.773
Take care, Forrest.

35:37.376 --> 35:40.880
[REM announcer] All racers,
make sure to come sign in before 9:00 a.m.

35:45.916 --> 35:47.385
We picked a hell of a day
to come to the track, huh?

35:47.519 --> 35:48.587
Yeah.

35:49.287 --> 35:50.188
Yep.

35:50.322 --> 35:51.457
So what do you want to do?

35:54.392 --> 35:55.427
I think I'll race.

35:55.561 --> 35:56.394
[Cyrus laughs]

35:56.528 --> 35:58.663
Yeah, okay. No.

35:58.796 --> 36:00.632
Let's see if you can
make a lap first.

36:04.468 --> 36:06.104
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

36:06.238 --> 36:07.706
Hey! Roosting around is one thing.
Going wheel-to-wheel

36:07.840 --> 36:09.240
is not smart for someone
in your condition.

36:09.374 --> 36:11.509
- I need that money, Cyrus.
- Dude, I promised Sophie.

36:11.642 --> 36:13.345
I know, I know.
Let me deal with her.

36:13.479 --> 36:15.047
Oh, yeah, you're gonna be real
convincing from a hospital bed.

36:15.180 --> 36:16.849
This is with or
without you, man.

36:20.519 --> 36:22.721
This is a terrible idea.

36:24.990 --> 36:26.425
[woman] You're all set.
Good luck.

36:26.557 --> 36:28.226
- Thank you.
- Next.

36:31.496 --> 36:32.932
Marshall Bennett?

36:34.666 --> 36:35.868
Hey, Charlotte.

36:36.501 --> 36:37.969
Welcome back.

36:38.336 --> 36:39.204
Thank you.

36:47.178 --> 36:48.579
Stay out of the pack.

36:48.713 --> 36:50.416
And whatever you do,
take it easy coming down Mt. Whitney.

36:50.548 --> 36:52.016
I got it.

36:52.150 --> 36:53.852
Man, the bike
isn't even dialed in.

36:53.985 --> 36:55.887
It'll be fine.
This is the last track I rode.

36:56.021 --> 36:57.089
Four years ago.

36:57.222 --> 36:58.256
[REM announcer]
Riders to the starting gate.

36:58.389 --> 36:59.257
We're about to start.

37:01.559 --> 37:03.128
Aren't you Muslim?

37:03.262 --> 37:04.930
Only in front
of my grandmother.

37:10.200 --> 37:11.736
[engines revving]

37:18.343 --> 37:20.145
[REM announcer]
Today's race will be 20 laps,

37:20.278 --> 37:23.681
and boy, oh, boy,
what an exciting 20 laps it's gonna be.

37:23.816 --> 37:25.984
All the local up-and-comers
out to prove a point.

37:26.117 --> 37:27.584
Everyone has their favorites.

37:27.718 --> 37:29.521
Let's see who wins.

37:41.532 --> 37:42.901
[Kurt yawns]

37:45.302 --> 37:47.404
[REM announcer] Today's wild
card is a ghost from the past.

37:47.539 --> 37:49.108
- Look who's here.
- [REM announcer] Local REM champ

37:49.240 --> 37:53.010
and winner of the Loretta Lynn,
the 450 class in 2015.

37:53.144 --> 37:54.979
Haven't seen him here
since then.

37:55.113 --> 37:57.216
Ladies and gentlemen,
wearing number 32,

37:57.349 --> 37:59.051
it's Marshall Bennett.

37:59.184 --> 38:00.385
[Kurt] Hmm?

38:00.517 --> 38:02.854
- Did I hear that right?
- He's dumber than I thought.

38:07.526 --> 38:08.894
[laughs]

38:15.066 --> 38:16.668
[REM announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen,

38:16.800 --> 38:18.436
let's moto!

38:18.570 --> 38:20.039
[cheering and whistling]

38:30.381 --> 38:31.350
And they're off!

38:41.392 --> 38:45.130
And Rob Pocius has the lead as
they shoot down the front straight.

38:51.635 --> 38:53.005
[spectators whistling]

38:56.740 --> 38:58.543
[Marshall grunts]

38:58.675 --> 39:01.813
[REM announcer] The faster riders
are already starting to break away.

39:10.255 --> 39:12.090
As they come around
the back side of the track,

39:12.222 --> 39:14.458
Chris Walker closes in
on Rob Pocius,

39:14.592 --> 39:15.860
fighting for the lead.

39:18.428 --> 39:19.298
[Chris] See ya!

39:21.198 --> 39:22.767
[REM announcer] And Chris
Walker takes the lead!

39:22.901 --> 39:25.037
It was just a matter
of time, folks.

39:32.711 --> 39:33.846
[Marshall] Oh, shit.

39:52.664 --> 39:54.299
I feel bad for him, man.

39:54.432 --> 39:56.301
[Tony]
It's a straight-up shame, bro.

39:56.434 --> 39:58.570
[REM announcer] At the back of the
pack, it's Marshall Bennett,

39:58.702 --> 40:00.005
struggling to keep up,

40:00.137 --> 40:02.139
while Chris Walker leads
the pack into lap two!

40:02.273 --> 40:03.207
Attaboy.

40:12.050 --> 40:14.318
[REM announcer] Oh, man, the local
boys are giving it all they've got,

40:14.452 --> 40:16.021
but Walker is
just pulling away.

40:16.153 --> 40:18.023
- He's on a whole other level!
- [Chris laughs]

40:22.461 --> 40:24.062
[REM announcer]
Here he comes again!

40:24.195 --> 40:25.863
It doesn't even look
like he's breaking a sweat.

40:33.505 --> 40:36.175
Chris Walker's proving to have
some serious stamina here.

40:36.307 --> 40:37.941
We're halfway through the race,

40:38.075 --> 40:40.012
and the rest of the pack is
running out of steam.

40:41.512 --> 40:42.381
[Marshall grunts]

40:43.914 --> 40:44.983
Let's go.

40:48.318 --> 40:49.188
Good.

40:54.758 --> 40:58.229
[REM announcer] Number 32 is moving
up, no longer bringing up the rear.

41:09.941 --> 41:11.009
[Marshall] Come on.

41:19.450 --> 41:21.320
[REM announcer] Look at this!
It seems like number 32's

41:21.452 --> 41:23.755
finally shifted out
of first gear!

41:35.400 --> 41:36.834
I don't know if I believe
what I'm seeing,

41:36.968 --> 41:39.070
but Bennett is
reeling in Walker.

41:40.003 --> 41:41.139
[Marshall] Here we go.

41:43.008 --> 41:44.009
[spectators exclaiming]

41:44.142 --> 41:47.178
And 32 sends it off the triple!

41:47.311 --> 41:48.880
[spectators cheering
and whistling]

41:50.948 --> 41:51.983
[Marshall] Come on!

41:53.017 --> 41:55.485
Folks, this is incredible.
Marshall Bennett

41:55.619 --> 41:56.887
shows up out of nowhere,

41:57.021 --> 41:59.090
passes the entire field,
and is now giving

41:59.224 --> 42:00.658
one of our hottest
up-and-coming racers

42:00.791 --> 42:02.193
a run for his money!

42:11.535 --> 42:12.671
[spectators cheering]

42:12.803 --> 42:14.939
Yes! Go, kid, go!

42:19.610 --> 42:21.112
He's right on his dumb ass!

42:25.550 --> 42:26.418
[Chris] Not today!

42:27.919 --> 42:29.488
[REM announcer]
Walker is fighting hard.

42:29.621 --> 42:31.155
He will not let Bennett by.

42:37.195 --> 42:39.030
He's right behind you!
Keep it going!

42:45.436 --> 42:47.538
[REM announcer]
One and 32 are just flying!

42:47.671 --> 42:49.941
Now they're starting
to lap other riders.

42:55.280 --> 42:57.015
[breathing heavily]

43:06.957 --> 43:08.260
Last lap, folks.

43:08.392 --> 43:10.428
[laughing] Wow.
Who would have predicted this?

43:18.736 --> 43:19.604
Yes!

43:33.517 --> 43:35.454
[REM announcer] Looks like
Bennett has finally hit his limit.

43:35.586 --> 43:39.023
He had an incredible run,
but he just can't get past Walker.

43:40.957 --> 43:42.126
[Marshall] Come on! Come on!

43:49.601 --> 43:51.669
Son of a bitch,
I know what you're gonna do.

43:54.838 --> 43:55.907
[Marshall] Gotcha.

43:58.876 --> 43:59.945
Do it!

44:04.249 --> 44:05.483
[REM announcer]
Bennett passes Walker!

44:05.617 --> 44:06.584
I can't believe it!

44:06.718 --> 44:07.552
Yeah!

44:07.684 --> 44:09.186
[spectators cheering]

44:12.956 --> 44:14.025
[Marshall] Whoo!

44:17.394 --> 44:18.362
[laughs]

44:31.309 --> 44:32.377
[Marshall] Oh, come on!

44:33.845 --> 44:34.713
[Cyrus] Come on!

44:37.948 --> 44:39.050
Whoo!

44:39.684 --> 44:40.952
Yeah!

44:41.086 --> 44:43.555
Marshall Bennett wins
the 450 Pro Class!

44:43.688 --> 44:45.289
Un-bloody-believable!

44:46.724 --> 44:47.992
What bullshit.

44:50.494 --> 44:51.662
[man] Yeah!

44:53.631 --> 44:54.633
[exhales]

44:55.767 --> 44:56.668
[Cyrus] Son of a bitch!

44:56.800 --> 44:57.768
Yeah!

44:57.901 --> 45:00.104
Yes. Buddy, nice!

45:00.238 --> 45:01.573
- You okay?
- Yeah.

45:01.706 --> 45:02.573
That was great.

45:09.113 --> 45:10.581
You done parade-lapping, kid?

45:13.517 --> 45:15.253
- [spectators cheering]
- [Cyrus] Look at that.

45:15.387 --> 45:17.722
- Marshall Bennett, number 32.
- [Marshall] Thanks, guys.

45:17.854 --> 45:21.693
[Cyrus] That's 32% off
everything at Moto Mischief.

45:21.825 --> 45:24.028
- [Marshall] I'm gonna hit the bathroom.
- [Cyrus] All right, buddy.

45:24.162 --> 45:25.697
[grunting]

45:29.133 --> 45:30.334
[groans]

45:31.202 --> 45:32.738
[groaning]

45:45.450 --> 45:47.652
[breathing heavily]

45:59.697 --> 46:00.631
What do you think?

46:00.999 --> 46:02.100
I like it.

46:03.702 --> 46:04.770
It's a good machine.

46:04.903 --> 46:06.771
Can you do a little better
on the price?

46:06.903 --> 46:07.773
[car horn honking]

46:09.874 --> 46:10.742
[Cal] Maybe.

46:11.943 --> 46:13.477
[dog barking]

46:14.644 --> 46:15.646
Excuse me, Earl.

46:27.858 --> 46:29.160
I'm gonna wait right here.

46:32.664 --> 46:33.465
Dad.

46:33.597 --> 46:34.465
[Cal] What's up?

46:37.936 --> 46:38.970
You don't have to sell it, Dad.

46:39.102 --> 46:40.505
What? Why?

46:41.372 --> 46:42.140
[Marshall] I got the money.

46:42.273 --> 46:43.341
[Cal] Phew.

46:46.477 --> 46:48.580
What did you do, rob a bank?

46:52.582 --> 46:53.452
Worse.

47:00.224 --> 47:01.293
I won.

47:04.128 --> 47:05.430
I'm gonna race again.

47:11.869 --> 47:12.736
Sophie.

47:14.106 --> 47:15.939
Sophie, can you please
just stop?

47:16.073 --> 47:17.809
Baby, please.

47:17.941 --> 47:19.843
I can't just let him sell the house!
What did you want me to do?

47:19.977 --> 47:22.346
[Sophie] You are out of
your damn mind, Marshall.

47:22.479 --> 47:24.582
When you wanted to serve,
I stood by you.

47:24.715 --> 47:26.550
When they sent you overseas,
I stood by you.

47:26.684 --> 47:28.285
- Sophie, I understand that.
- When you got injured,

47:28.418 --> 47:30.554
I stood by you. I bathed you,
I emptied your bedpan!

47:30.688 --> 47:32.155
I can't keep walking around
defeated, baby.

47:32.289 --> 47:33.523
I gotta be able to
say that I tried.

47:33.657 --> 47:35.893
And what happens
when you go down mid-pack?

47:36.026 --> 47:37.496
Because that's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna end up

47:37.628 --> 47:39.764
- in a wheelchair, or worse!
- I know. I...

47:41.733 --> 47:43.101
I know.

47:43.233 --> 47:45.736
I'd rather risk it than
die a little bit every day.

47:48.273 --> 47:49.774
I almost lost you once.

47:51.142 --> 47:52.544
You can't do that to me again.

47:52.677 --> 47:53.544
[Marshall] Baby.

47:54.244 --> 47:55.712
- Sophie.
- [Sophie crying] No!

47:55.847 --> 47:56.715
Just...

47:58.314 --> 47:59.383
[door shuts]

48:02.720 --> 48:03.588
[sighs]

48:09.160 --> 48:10.896
[inhales deeply]

48:16.034 --> 48:17.302
[crying]

48:19.035 --> 48:19.836
[knock on door]

48:19.970 --> 48:21.338
Go away, Marshall.

48:21.472 --> 48:22.740
[Cal] It's me, darlin'.

48:23.773 --> 48:24.608
Can we talk?

48:24.742 --> 48:26.010
[inhales deeply]

48:26.376 --> 48:27.445
[exhales]

48:28.945 --> 48:30.447
Yeah, come on in.

48:34.251 --> 48:35.452
[sighs]

48:35.887 --> 48:36.755
You okay?

48:39.090 --> 48:40.225
I hear ya.

48:41.325 --> 48:42.394
Come sit.

48:43.193 --> 48:44.262
Come on.

48:51.802 --> 48:53.136
[sighs]

48:53.271 --> 48:57.642
Sophie, I was married
to an Army helicopter pilot

48:57.776 --> 48:59.410
for 22 years.

48:59.543 --> 49:02.980
So... where you are right now,

49:03.780 --> 49:05.449
I've been there.

49:05.582 --> 49:09.086
Almost didn't marry her
because I was so afraid

49:09.220 --> 49:11.122
that someday...

49:11.256 --> 49:13.558
I was gonna get
a knock on that door.

49:15.293 --> 49:16.427
[sniffles]

49:16.561 --> 49:18.496
How did you deal
with that every day?

49:19.863 --> 49:22.400
Well, it's simple.

49:22.532 --> 49:25.002
I just couldn't imagine
my life without her.

49:28.606 --> 49:30.874
Pattie was in the Army
all her life.

49:32.142 --> 49:33.276
So many deployments,

49:33.410 --> 49:37.180
they eventually
just became routine.

49:37.314 --> 49:39.583
[sniffles]
Till one day...

49:41.151 --> 49:44.990
She went down in a training
exercise, of all things.

49:47.959 --> 49:49.294
I, uh...

49:49.427 --> 49:52.697
I know I seem
like a tough old guy to you,

49:52.829 --> 49:53.930
but that day...

49:54.698 --> 49:56.834
God, that day, my heart broke.

49:58.202 --> 50:02.740
She was the love of my life,
and she gave me Marshall.

50:04.675 --> 50:06.644
And everything that I am,

50:07.345 --> 50:10.448
everything good about me,

50:10.581 --> 50:14.585
really came from the time
I had with her.

50:15.952 --> 50:16.820
So...

50:18.389 --> 50:21.791
if my boy is the one for you,

50:21.925 --> 50:25.929
don't let what-ifs control
the decisions that you make.

50:28.499 --> 50:29.834
[Cal sniffles]

50:50.588 --> 50:52.557
I'm surprised
she let you come back.

50:53.858 --> 50:54.892
Let's talk.

50:58.662 --> 51:00.831
Okay, I need you
to be straight with me.

51:00.965 --> 51:03.568
Is going pro
a real possibility?

51:03.700 --> 51:06.169
Yeah. Lots of riders
recover from injury.

51:06.302 --> 51:07.771
As bad as Marshall's?

51:07.905 --> 51:09.606
Doug Henry, Trey Canard, yeah.

51:09.740 --> 51:11.943
Some with more success
than others.

51:12.077 --> 51:14.079
But what are
his chances really?

51:14.646 --> 51:15.914
I don't know.

51:16.046 --> 51:17.313
You want me to look
at my crystal ball and...

51:17.447 --> 51:18.749
See, no,
that's not good enough.

51:18.883 --> 51:20.451
Marshall is
not just your motocross buddy.

51:20.584 --> 51:22.086
He is the father of my child.

51:22.218 --> 51:23.921
We cannot bop around
these little amateur tracks

51:24.055 --> 51:26.390
for a couple hundred dollars
a race.

51:27.425 --> 51:28.993
Do you want me onboard?

51:29.126 --> 51:30.960
Okay, then look at me
in my eyes,

51:31.095 --> 51:32.696
don't give me
your Cyrus bullshit,

51:32.829 --> 51:35.532
and tell me what
your gut says, please.

51:40.204 --> 51:42.374
You wanna know
the real reason I hired him?

51:42.807 --> 51:44.175
Sure.

51:44.309 --> 51:46.110
Imagine you owned
a piano store,

51:46.244 --> 51:49.813
and Mozart walked in the door
asking for an application.

51:49.947 --> 51:52.883
That's how I felt when he
came in looking for a job.

51:53.017 --> 51:54.418
My gut tells me

51:54.552 --> 51:56.352
that Marshall is one of the
most naturally gifted riders

51:56.486 --> 51:59.088
I've ever seen, and I've been
watching him since he's a kid.

51:59.222 --> 52:00.624
It's effortless for him.

52:01.191 --> 52:02.760
But can he still play?

52:02.892 --> 52:05.530
Yeah, from what I saw
yesterday, I'll put money on it.

52:05.662 --> 52:07.998
I will sponsor him
with everything I got.

52:11.102 --> 52:12.937
Do you even know anything
about tuning a bike?

52:13.070 --> 52:14.639
I was the baddest crew chief
on this side of...

52:14.771 --> 52:17.407
Perfect, you are crew chief,
I am team manager.

52:17.541 --> 52:18.875
This is the deal
I made with Marshall

52:19.010 --> 52:21.579
if you want me onboard.
So, take it or leave it.

52:23.514 --> 52:24.582
We good here?

52:25.916 --> 52:28.584
I don't know about
all this women-in-power stuff.

52:28.718 --> 52:30.053
Maybe it's my heritage,

52:30.188 --> 52:32.555
but in my country,
women are seen, not heard.

52:33.189 --> 52:34.425
They're not even seen.

52:39.764 --> 52:41.466
Okay, so you need 60 AMA points

52:41.599 --> 52:43.635
to get your racing license back
and go pro.

52:43.767 --> 52:45.269
The fastest way for you
to do that

52:45.403 --> 52:47.938
is to finish in the top three
in four qualifier races.

52:48.072 --> 52:50.374
Now, you've got the skill,
but you don't have the stamina.

52:50.508 --> 52:52.076
If Walker would have gone
flat-out the entire time,

52:52.209 --> 52:53.744
he would've had you.
It's gonna take time

52:53.878 --> 52:55.246
to rebuild your strength.

52:55.378 --> 52:57.581
And the stronger you are,
the safer you'll be.

53:00.718 --> 53:02.553
- All right, go for it.
- [Marshall] Yeah?

53:05.856 --> 53:07.490
Yeah, all right.
Your turn, Dad.

53:07.624 --> 53:09.025
[chuckles] No.

53:09.159 --> 53:10.394
[Cyrus] <i>We need you
on an intensive regimen</i>

53:10.528 --> 53:11.829
<i>of low-impact cardio</i>

53:11.961 --> 53:13.430
<i>for a few weeks
before you race again.</i>

53:13.564 --> 53:14.799
[Sophie] <i>And to keep
our travel expenses low,</i>

53:14.932 --> 53:16.367
<i>we'll stick to nearby races.</i>

53:16.501 --> 53:18.202
We'll get you
the best gear possible,

53:18.336 --> 53:20.205
then we'll start doing some
regular training on the track.

53:21.171 --> 53:22.773
[grunting]

53:22.907 --> 53:25.542
[Sophie] Okay, so this brace is
going to give you the most support

53:25.675 --> 53:27.478
and even more flexibility.

53:28.646 --> 53:29.881
How's it feel?

53:30.014 --> 53:31.816
- Yeah, it's good.
- Yeah?

53:34.619 --> 53:37.354
[Cyrus] <i>You're still a little stiff.
You've gotta get smoother.</i>

53:37.488 --> 53:40.024
<i>Practice those jumps,
don't get too fancy,</i>

53:40.157 --> 53:43.093
<i>don't lay the bike too low.
It's too risky a move.</i>

53:43.227 --> 53:44.863
Focus on your landing.

53:47.597 --> 53:48.967
[grunting]

53:54.204 --> 53:57.842
All purse money goes to you guys
to help keep a roof over your head.

54:03.046 --> 54:03.813
[Harley barking]

54:03.947 --> 54:05.082
[Marshall]
Come on, Harley.

54:18.028 --> 54:19.463
- [Sophie] Boo!
- Oh!

54:19.597 --> 54:21.432
- [Sophie laughing]
- You suck.

54:21.564 --> 54:23.233
Oh, I'm sorry, did I scare you?

54:23.367 --> 54:24.936
I am going to have
to set you straight.

54:25.068 --> 54:27.838
Oh, yeah? You and what army?

55:05.409 --> 55:06.209
[Marshall] You got it?

55:06.343 --> 55:07.211
[Cyrus] Yeah, I got it.

55:18.889 --> 55:20.825
[Tony] Hey, look who showed up.

55:27.131 --> 55:28.700
Okay, I'm gonna
get us signed in.

55:28.832 --> 55:30.867
- [Marshall] Okay, baby.
- [Cyrus] Thank you, baby.

55:33.403 --> 55:35.706
[Tony] Team Panterra
looking good!

55:35.840 --> 55:37.675
Hey, what's up, Dickson?

55:38.909 --> 55:40.443
- Hey, welcome, V-dog.
- [Marshall] Who's that?

55:40.577 --> 55:42.813
[Cyrus] That's Kurt's boys,
the Team Irongrip mechanics.

55:43.680 --> 55:45.715
Do they have
a masseuse in there?

55:45.849 --> 55:49.219
If they do,
you're on your own, kid.

55:52.055 --> 55:53.858
[speaking indistinctly]

55:55.258 --> 55:57.128
[Chris laughing]
What is he doing?

56:07.470 --> 56:08.338
[grunts]

56:14.744 --> 56:16.913
[announcer] As we get down to
the last few minutes of the race,

56:17.046 --> 56:19.682
I don't see anyone catching
Chris Walker today.

56:19.816 --> 56:21.885
He's been dominating
this track.

56:23.988 --> 56:26.024
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Come on!

56:31.729 --> 56:33.797
- [announcer] And Walker takes it!
- [Chris] Yeah!

56:33.930 --> 56:35.499
- Followed by Ashton, Lee, and Bennett!
- [Marshall breathing heavily]

56:35.633 --> 56:38.069
- Yes! Yeah! Whoo!
- Okay, okay. That was good.

56:38.802 --> 56:40.803
Yeah! That was it!

56:40.938 --> 56:42.240
Good job, man.

56:42.740 --> 56:44.341
[panting]

56:45.242 --> 56:47.144
I hesitated too much.
I got in my head.

56:47.278 --> 56:48.946
Baby, you beat 20 other riders.

56:49.079 --> 56:51.047
Fourth place, that's 18 points.
Not a bad start.

56:51.182 --> 56:53.084
- You went right through.
- You're on fire!

56:53.217 --> 56:54.952
Yeah! I'm proud of you, man.

57:04.461 --> 57:06.463
[announcer] And it's gonna be
Walker, McClane, and Bennett

57:06.597 --> 57:07.965
in the top three spots.

57:09.133 --> 57:11.468
Third place, that's 1,500 bucks.
That's great.

57:11.602 --> 57:13.104
You were amazing, babe.

57:13.236 --> 57:14.872
I need to lower the back
and stiffen the front

57:15.005 --> 57:16.472
so I can turn easier.

57:16.606 --> 57:17.909
Cool. No problem.

57:23.512 --> 57:24.781
I can go faster.

57:28.251 --> 57:30.454
[announcer] Wow, folks,
this has been a contentious race,

57:30.588 --> 57:31.956
with number one, Chris Walker,

57:32.088 --> 57:33.490
managing to stay in front
of this tight pack.

57:33.624 --> 57:34.492
Go, go, go!

57:37.427 --> 57:40.029
[announcer] Only two more laps,
and Walker is finally breaking away.

57:40.164 --> 57:41.365
- Come on, Chris!
- Come on!

57:44.602 --> 57:45.737
[Marshall] Here I come.

57:54.144 --> 57:57.046
[announcer] Last lap. And I don't
know if I can believe what I'm seeing,

57:57.180 --> 57:59.215
but Marshall Bennett
is gaining on Chris Walker...

57:59.349 --> 58:00.816
- [Chris] Shit!
- ...at an alarming rate!

58:00.950 --> 58:01.918
[Marshall] I'm coming,
I'm coming.

58:02.052 --> 58:03.320
Push, push, push!

58:03.454 --> 58:04.488
- You're almost there!
- Come on, come on!

58:04.622 --> 58:05.456
Hold on!

58:05.856 --> 58:06.924
[man] Whoo!

58:11.428 --> 58:12.963
Come on, push, push!
You got it, baby!

58:13.097 --> 58:14.432
Go, go, go now! Go!

58:18.668 --> 58:20.570
[announcer] And Chris Walker
barely takes it

58:20.704 --> 58:22.906
with Marshall Bennett
just a nose behind.

58:23.039 --> 58:24.206
- What a tight race.
- [Sophie] Whoo!

58:24.340 --> 58:25.575
- [Cyrus] Second place!
- Oh, my God!

58:25.709 --> 58:26.844
- Yes, yes, yes, yes!
- Yes!

58:31.814 --> 58:33.050
- Bike issues?
- [panting]

58:33.684 --> 58:35.118
[Chris] No, he's good.

58:35.251 --> 58:37.954
No, man, you just gotta work
on some of your lines.

58:38.088 --> 58:39.856
[Tony] You better
think about your lines.

58:39.990 --> 58:41.659
[Kurt] Oh, yeah? Why's that?

58:41.791 --> 58:43.994
One more race, he turns pro,

58:44.128 --> 58:45.796
then you gotta deal with him.

58:48.898 --> 58:50.034
[man] Great job, man.

58:54.171 --> 58:56.106
[Cyrus] All right, team,
Victorville is next,

58:56.238 --> 58:59.177
and as long as you finish in the top
10, you'll have the points you'll need.

58:59.309 --> 59:01.445
And we already have
the sponsors' attention.

59:02.880 --> 59:04.081
Your hand, please, sir?

59:04.648 --> 59:05.515
Thank you.

59:06.617 --> 59:08.185
Come on.

59:08.318 --> 59:09.785
All of us, please.
We haven't done this in a while.

59:09.919 --> 59:11.521
We never should have stopped.

59:12.956 --> 59:14.358
Dear Lord,

59:14.492 --> 59:16.927
we are always grateful
for our time together.

59:17.059 --> 59:19.362
Thank you for this roof
still over our heads,

59:19.497 --> 59:23.467
this food in front of us,
and, most of all, good company.

59:23.934 --> 59:25.101
Even Cyrus.

59:25.235 --> 59:26.236
[Cal and Marshall chuckle]

59:26.369 --> 59:27.904
Amen. [giggles]

59:28.037 --> 59:29.106
Amen.

59:29.939 --> 59:31.242
You want your veggies?

59:39.249 --> 59:40.583
Terrain's a little harder
than I thought.

59:40.718 --> 59:42.553
- I think we can go down a few clicks.
- Okay.

59:46.023 --> 59:47.525
[Cyrus] Hey, can you grab
the shock tool?

59:49.660 --> 59:50.528
[exhales]

59:56.867 --> 59:59.669
[girl] Daddy, there's 32.

59:59.802 --> 01:00:01.204
[man] Good eye, sweetheart.

01:00:06.644 --> 01:00:08.512
Hi, sir,
I'm looking for Marshall.

01:00:15.184 --> 01:00:16.353
Hey, Sarge.

01:00:20.423 --> 01:00:21.291
Riley?

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:23.894
Hey, man.

01:00:24.294 --> 01:00:25.162
Hey.

01:00:29.066 --> 01:00:30.701
[both crying]

01:00:31.334 --> 01:00:32.970
Oh, it's good to see you.

01:00:34.137 --> 01:00:36.073
Sorry I didn't return
those emails.

01:00:38.909 --> 01:00:40.376
It's okay. You're okay.

01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:42.779
[Riley] I was in a bad way
for a while.

01:00:43.146 --> 01:00:44.782
You know.

01:00:44.914 --> 01:00:47.717
Oh. Um, Rebecca has something
she wants to tell you.

01:00:47.851 --> 01:00:50.121
Oh, yeah? Hey, sweetie.

01:00:51.521 --> 01:00:54.358
Thank you for bringing
my daddy home.

01:01:00.831 --> 01:01:02.566
You're welcome, sweetheart.

01:01:02.698 --> 01:01:04.101
You got a good daddy.

01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:08.939
- Thank you.
- [Marshall] Yeah. Of course.

01:01:12.675 --> 01:01:14.577
- This is my wife, Sophie.
- Hi.

01:01:14.711 --> 01:01:16.780
- [Marshall] This is my dad, Cal.
- Pleased to meet you. Hi.

01:01:16.914 --> 01:01:18.883
[Marshall] Little Ray-Ray over
there, this is my good buddy, Cyrus.

01:01:19.015 --> 01:01:20.184
Name's Riley. Nice to meet you.

01:01:20.316 --> 01:01:21.584
Nice to meet you.

01:01:21.718 --> 01:01:22.720
[Marshall] How'd you know
I was racing?

01:01:23.153 --> 01:01:24.388
Um...

01:01:24.521 --> 01:01:26.023
I've actually been
riding again myself.

01:01:26.155 --> 01:01:27.590
Like, for therapy.

01:01:27.724 --> 01:01:29.026
Oh, yeah?

01:01:29.159 --> 01:01:31.262
Uh, with a veterans
support group, VetMx.

01:01:31.394 --> 01:01:34.296
One of the guys saw your last
race and mentioned your name.

01:01:35.064 --> 01:01:36.599
I didn't believe him at first.

01:01:38.369 --> 01:01:40.004
[Marshall] Well, it's good
to see you, man.

01:01:41.037 --> 01:01:43.006
Bennett likes to
take the outside line.

01:01:43.139 --> 01:01:45.007
He goes outside, you go inside.

01:01:45.142 --> 01:01:47.110
He goes inside, take outside.

01:01:47.242 --> 01:01:49.079
Right, I got you.

01:01:49.213 --> 01:01:51.415
You're quicker than him
in the transitions.

01:01:51.548 --> 01:01:53.150
That's where you can yard him.

01:01:53.650 --> 01:01:54.517
Focus.

01:01:55.218 --> 01:01:56.287
We're good.

01:02:06.463 --> 01:02:07.731
[announcer] What a battle
for first place!

01:02:07.865 --> 01:02:09.467
Bennett determined to
take the top spot,

01:02:09.599 --> 01:02:12.602
but Walker fighting
just as hard to keep it.

01:02:12.735 --> 01:02:14.404
- [Sophie] Come on, let's go!
- [Cyrus] Go, go, go, go.

01:02:14.537 --> 01:02:17.207
Yes, yes, yes, keep it going.
Keep it going!

01:02:25.948 --> 01:02:27.517
[announcer] Walker tries
to make a move in turn two,

01:02:27.651 --> 01:02:29.520
but he just can't
catch Bennett!

01:02:30.753 --> 01:02:31.621
[clanging]

01:02:32.389 --> 01:02:34.057
We've only got two laps to go!

01:02:34.191 --> 01:02:36.026
- Yes, yes, yes, come on!
- [cheering]

01:02:41.131 --> 01:02:42.199
[rattling]

01:02:43.967 --> 01:02:45.035
[Marshall] Shit!

01:02:47.137 --> 01:02:48.305
Oh, my God.

01:02:53.711 --> 01:02:54.779
Ooh, that's gotta hurt.

01:02:54.912 --> 01:02:56.680
[announcer] Oh,
and Bennett goes off track.

01:02:57.247 --> 01:02:58.816
Let's hope he's okay.

01:02:58.948 --> 01:02:59.816
[Marshall breathing heavily]

01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:00.818
[Marshall] Damn.

01:03:02.552 --> 01:03:04.954
Just go. Just go.
I got the baby.

01:03:05.088 --> 01:03:06.590
Stay here, I'll be back.

01:03:08.325 --> 01:03:09.393
- [bone cracking]
- [grunting]

01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:14.165
[groaning]

01:03:17.968 --> 01:03:19.670
[inaudible]

01:03:47.697 --> 01:03:48.565
Hold up.

01:03:59.209 --> 01:04:00.244
[exhales]

01:04:00.811 --> 01:04:01.879
Let's get outta here.

01:04:33.242 --> 01:04:34.311
Hey, asshole.

01:04:38.615 --> 01:04:40.884
I know what you did,
you trailer-trash piece of shit.

01:04:41.017 --> 01:04:42.552
[laughing]

01:04:43.387 --> 01:04:45.155
You either got huge balls,

01:04:45.289 --> 01:04:47.525
or your eyesight
ain't so good, little man.

01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:52.329
[all laughing]

01:04:52.896 --> 01:04:53.764
[grunts]

01:04:55.398 --> 01:04:56.467
[Cyrus laughs]

01:04:57.767 --> 01:04:58.635
[man] Oh.

01:05:11.881 --> 01:05:13.582
[Marshall]
<i>Come on, Riley, hang on!</i>

01:05:13.717 --> 01:05:15.352
[echoing] <i>Hang on, hang on,
hang on, hang on.</i>

01:05:16.653 --> 01:05:18.455
<i>All right, almost there!
You're gonna make it!</i>

01:05:18.588 --> 01:05:20.356
[echoing] <i>Gonna make it,
gonna make it.</i>

01:05:26.697 --> 01:05:28.631
[female doctor]
Oblique tibial fracture.

01:05:28.764 --> 01:05:30.733
And that's on the good leg.

01:05:30.867 --> 01:05:32.034
With these injuries,

01:05:32.903 --> 01:05:34.371
I'd tell you
he shouldn't be racing,

01:05:34.505 --> 01:05:36.907
but I assume
you've already tried that.

01:05:37.039 --> 01:05:39.575
- Yeah.
- These guys are worse than junkies.

01:05:39.709 --> 01:05:41.278
- How long until...
- I know what you're gonna ask.

01:05:41.410 --> 01:05:44.546
Eight weeks minimum before he
sets a foot on a bike again.

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:45.916
Twelve weeks would be better.

01:05:46.050 --> 01:05:48.184
- Never again would be best.
- [exhales]

01:05:48.318 --> 01:05:49.886
I'll check up on him tomorrow.

01:05:50.019 --> 01:05:50.988
Thanks, Doc.

01:05:56.526 --> 01:05:57.961
He's gonna miss
all his qualifiers.

01:05:58.095 --> 01:06:00.397
Okay, hold on with that.

01:06:02.099 --> 01:06:04.434
Can I have a minute
with him, please?

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:05.702
Of course.

01:06:18.113 --> 01:06:18.983
Babe?

01:06:21.351 --> 01:06:22.419
Babe.

01:06:27.523 --> 01:06:29.392
I don't know what
I was thinking, baby.

01:06:31.026 --> 01:06:32.394
What? Don't say that.

01:06:32.528 --> 01:06:34.063
No, you were right.
It's too risky.

01:06:34.197 --> 01:06:35.399
It's too risky.

01:06:35.532 --> 01:06:38.302
[Sophie] Stop.
Racing is part of you.

01:06:38.434 --> 01:06:42.505
And I realize that when I said,
"I do," it was to all of you.

01:06:44.541 --> 01:06:45.709
Thank you.

01:06:48.110 --> 01:06:49.279
For what?

01:06:50.247 --> 01:06:52.349
For letting me
get to say I tried.

01:07:01.892 --> 01:07:02.860
Scooch.

01:07:05.494 --> 01:07:06.563
[Marshall grunts]

01:07:06.697 --> 01:07:07.564
Come on.

01:07:11.101 --> 01:07:12.303
[sighs]

01:07:18.775 --> 01:07:22.945
So, I think I should probably
take next semester off

01:07:23.079 --> 01:07:24.546
- and go back to...
- No, baby. Baby, no.

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:27.349
No, just...
Just for a little bit.

01:07:27.483 --> 01:07:30.787
So we don't fall so far behind,
you know?

01:07:37.193 --> 01:07:39.929
When I'm better,
I'm gonna fix a thousand bikes,

01:07:40.063 --> 01:07:42.064
and I'm gonna teach
a million kids to ride,

01:07:42.198 --> 01:07:45.001
and I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to get you your clinic, baby.

01:07:46.168 --> 01:07:47.403
I promise you.

01:07:49.872 --> 01:07:51.374
[Sophie whispers] I love you.

01:07:51.508 --> 01:07:52.976
I love you so much.

01:08:12.595 --> 01:08:14.131
[aerosol spraying]

01:08:23.505 --> 01:08:24.774
Yo, Cyrus!

01:08:25.808 --> 01:08:26.942
Cyrus!

01:08:27.076 --> 01:08:28.245
[Cyrus] Yo?

01:08:28.379 --> 01:08:30.279
Bike's good to go.
Can I get a hand?

01:08:30.413 --> 01:08:31.648
[Cyrus] Be right there!

01:08:38.287 --> 01:08:39.321
- You got it?
- Looking good.

01:08:39.455 --> 01:08:40.624
- Looking good.
- All right.

01:08:51.367 --> 01:08:53.002
[Sophie] Lunch is here!

01:08:53.136 --> 01:08:54.670
- [Cyrus] Sophie.
- Cyrus.

01:08:59.809 --> 01:09:01.077
So what do you do
at the clinic?

01:09:01.210 --> 01:09:02.879
Do you ask the animals
to turn and cough?

01:09:03.446 --> 01:09:04.648
No.

01:09:04.781 --> 01:09:06.649
I give injections,
check their teeth,

01:09:06.782 --> 01:09:08.684
test for diseases,
stuff like that.

01:09:08.818 --> 01:09:11.687
- What about neutering?
- Mmm-hmm. We do that.

01:09:11.821 --> 01:09:13.555
I bet you're pretty good at it.

01:09:13.689 --> 01:09:14.991
Don't you forget it.

01:09:15.125 --> 01:09:16.660
[motorbike approaching]

01:09:35.245 --> 01:09:36.447
What's up, slugger?

01:09:37.246 --> 01:09:38.913
What do you want, Tony?

01:09:39.048 --> 01:09:41.785
I'm here to see Bennett.
I've got a question for him.

01:09:44.386 --> 01:09:45.688
Is that all you got?

01:09:46.423 --> 01:09:47.624
Excuse me?

01:09:47.756 --> 01:09:49.091
- Get outta here, Tony.
- I'm curious.

01:09:49.225 --> 01:09:50.492
Yeah, bye-bye, jerk-off.

01:09:50.626 --> 01:09:51.727
Don't get your panties
in a twist.

01:09:51.861 --> 01:09:53.363
- Excuse me?
- Turn around

01:09:53.495 --> 01:09:54.996
and walk out of this store.

01:09:55.130 --> 01:09:56.732
[Tony] I just wanna know
if he's done.

01:09:56.866 --> 01:09:58.569
- [Cyrus] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- It's okay. It's fine.

01:09:59.436 --> 01:10:00.670
What's your problem?

01:10:01.204 --> 01:10:02.072
Simple.

01:10:03.072 --> 01:10:05.476
Do you think you can beat
the Walker brothers?

01:10:06.976 --> 01:10:09.446
- If I wasn't hurt?
- Yeah, sure.

01:10:09.579 --> 01:10:11.581
I'd wipe my ass
with both of them.

01:10:13.183 --> 01:10:14.218
Okay, then...

01:10:15.384 --> 01:10:16.486
let me show you something.

01:10:20.557 --> 01:10:21.758
You see this?

01:10:22.425 --> 01:10:23.759
Hangtown, '97.

01:10:23.893 --> 01:10:25.762
Some jerk messed with my bike.

01:10:26.795 --> 01:10:28.196
Cost me my shot.

01:10:28.664 --> 01:10:29.933
I remember that.

01:10:30.732 --> 01:10:31.900
And you see this?

01:10:32.035 --> 01:10:34.403
This is from
rearranging his face.

01:10:34.536 --> 01:10:36.305
Yeah, I remember that, too.

01:10:36.439 --> 01:10:37.907
There's one thing I don't do,

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:40.409
and that's mess
with a man's bike.

01:10:40.543 --> 01:10:41.677
Yeah, but one of your boys did.

01:10:41.811 --> 01:10:43.045
He sure might have.

01:10:43.713 --> 01:10:45.313
But he ain't my boy no more.

01:10:45.447 --> 01:10:46.782
Chris left the team.

01:10:49.652 --> 01:10:52.187
We had an agreement
when I sponsored him

01:10:52.321 --> 01:10:53.655
that when he turns pro,

01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:55.325
he takes Panterra Racing
factory level with him.

01:10:55.459 --> 01:10:57.527
Instead, he jumps ship
and goes with Irongrip

01:10:57.660 --> 01:10:59.262
with his dumb brother.

01:10:59.396 --> 01:11:02.032
Nothing more do I want than
to kick both of their asses.

01:11:03.031 --> 01:11:04.534
But you know what's better?

01:11:05.535 --> 01:11:06.603
You.

01:11:08.437 --> 01:11:11.140
I want you to smoke
their asses on the track.

01:11:13.308 --> 01:11:14.276
Are you serious?

01:11:14.411 --> 01:11:15.979
I'm serious as a heart attack.

01:11:21.817 --> 01:11:23.152
I can't ride for a while.

01:11:23.286 --> 01:11:25.222
- How long?
- Four to six weeks.

01:11:25.354 --> 01:11:26.822
- [Tony] Stable or oblique fracture?
- [Marshall] It's a stable.

01:11:26.956 --> 01:11:28.258
You're good.
It's healed already.

01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:29.692
I'm sorry, are you a doctor?

01:11:29.826 --> 01:11:31.427
Do you know how many
broken bones I've had?

01:11:31.561 --> 01:11:34.630
If I get my physical therapist
to do his voodoo magic on you,

01:11:34.764 --> 01:11:36.932
you'll be good to go
in no time.

01:11:37.066 --> 01:11:38.635
Make it to the last qualifiers.

01:11:38.768 --> 01:11:40.971
Loretta Lynn's? No, I can't do that.
I can't afford it.

01:11:41.103 --> 01:11:42.871
- It's in Tennessee.
- I'll cover the expenses.

01:11:43.005 --> 01:11:45.142
Gas, hotel,
we'll get you out there.

01:11:48.178 --> 01:11:49.644
<i>But a couple months later,</i>

01:11:49.778 --> 01:11:51.947
Lucas Oil Outdoor
Pro Motocross.

01:11:52.081 --> 01:11:53.616
You're gonna have to win.

01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:55.418
<i>Get us sponsors,
keep this thing going.</i>

01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:57.187
[announcer] Marshall Bennett
wins the Loretta Lynn 450!

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.456
[Sophie] <i>But what's in it
for you?</i>

01:11:59.589 --> 01:12:01.323
Panterra Racing gets to go pro.

01:12:01.657 --> 01:12:02.726
Finally.

01:12:03.625 --> 01:12:04.760
You in?

01:12:35.592 --> 01:12:38.628
The Lucas Oil Pro Motocross
Championship season starts

01:12:38.762 --> 01:12:39.996
at historic Glen Helen Raceway

01:12:40.129 --> 01:12:41.930
in glorious
Southern California.

01:12:42.064 --> 01:12:43.732
[co-announcer] Yeah,
it's one of the most popular tracks

01:12:43.866 --> 01:12:46.069
due to its endless jumps
and elevation changes.

01:12:46.201 --> 01:12:48.604
You can find a lot of riders
training here all year,

01:12:48.738 --> 01:12:50.906
like number eight,
Chris Walker.

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.409
[announcer] <i>Today marks
his first pro race</i>

01:12:52.541 --> 01:12:54.311
- <i>with Irongrip Tools.</i>
- Okay, all set, Ray-Ray.

01:12:54.443 --> 01:12:55.577
[announcer] <i>He is, of course,
the younger brother</i>

01:12:55.710 --> 01:12:56.646
<i>of last year's champion,</i>

01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:58.514
<i>number 88, Kurt Walker.</i>

01:12:58.647 --> 01:13:00.582
[co-announcer] <i>Yeah, you know,
Chris placed in the top three</i>

01:13:00.717 --> 01:13:02.085
<i>in all of his qualifiers.</i>

01:13:02.218 --> 01:13:04.320
<i>Talent definitely
runs in this family,</i>

01:13:04.454 --> 01:13:06.656
<i>and I wouldn't be surprised to
see both of them on the podium.</i>

01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:09.226
- [co-announcer] <i>No question.</i>
- Awesome. Here you go.

01:13:09.726 --> 01:13:10.660
All right.

01:13:10.793 --> 01:13:11.795
What are you ladies' names?

01:13:11.928 --> 01:13:13.296
Victoria and Rebecca.

01:13:13.429 --> 01:13:15.198
Victoria and Rebecca.

01:13:15.330 --> 01:13:17.366
- Pretty names, huh?
- Yeah, very pretty.

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:18.802
Thank you, ladies.

01:13:19.302 --> 01:13:20.370
[both] Thank you.

01:13:31.513 --> 01:13:33.916
[Sophie] Hey, Tony.
Tony. Wait, hey.

01:13:34.049 --> 01:13:36.218
Have you thought
any more about our discussion?

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:38.254
Look, Sophie, no offense,

01:13:38.388 --> 01:13:40.456
but you don't have
a ton of experience.

01:13:40.589 --> 01:13:42.358
What do you mean?
I was running things just fine

01:13:42.491 --> 01:13:43.392
until you showed up.

01:13:43.526 --> 01:13:45.193
For half a season.

01:13:45.327 --> 01:13:46.862
I've been doing this
for 20 years.

01:13:46.995 --> 01:13:49.097
Okay, but I can take
some of your workload.

01:13:49.232 --> 01:13:50.867
I managed at the clinic.
I know how to delegate.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.602
Well, you can't be the manager.
I'm the team manager.

01:13:53.737 --> 01:13:55.238
I pay for all this shit.

01:13:56.071 --> 01:13:57.473
You got any other ideas?

01:14:03.112 --> 01:14:04.781
Public relations.

01:14:04.914 --> 01:14:07.282
I'm gonna help get us sponsors.

01:14:07.416 --> 01:14:10.219
And what the hell qualifications
do you have to do that?

01:14:10.353 --> 01:14:13.090
The sponsors are men,
and I have boobs.

01:14:15.457 --> 01:14:16.326
Deal.

01:14:22.264 --> 01:14:24.133
Hey, hey, quick, quick,
look, look, look.

01:14:24.267 --> 01:14:25.268
Look quick.

01:14:32.942 --> 01:14:34.744
- [groans]
- [both laughing]

01:14:43.585 --> 01:14:45.287
All right, easy, big guy.

01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:47.356
That's all the damage
they're gonna be doing today.

01:14:47.490 --> 01:14:50.227
Qualified ninth.
He's out of his league.

01:14:52.061 --> 01:14:53.463
Oh, hey, look who it is.

01:14:53.595 --> 01:14:56.031
- What's up, buddy?
- [Riley] Hey. Good to see you.

01:14:57.299 --> 01:14:59.634
Hey, man.
Thanks for coming out.

01:14:59.768 --> 01:15:01.003
- Hey, I wouldn't miss it.
- Yeah.

01:15:01.137 --> 01:15:02.237
And I brought you
a cheering section.

01:15:02.370 --> 01:15:04.172
- Yeah?
- They're from my support group.

01:15:04.307 --> 01:15:05.842
Gearheads through and through.

01:15:05.976 --> 01:15:07.242
Hey, I'm Justin.
It's an honor to meet you, Sarge.

01:15:07.376 --> 01:15:08.878
- Nice to meet you, man.
- I'm Dustin.

01:15:09.010 --> 01:15:11.214
- Hey, nice to meet you. Hey.
- Hi, I'm Brad.

01:15:11.347 --> 01:15:12.514
- [announcer] Attention, attention.
- [man] Nice to meet you.

01:15:12.647 --> 01:15:13.949
Nice to meet you.

01:15:14.082 --> 01:15:14.918
[announcer]
All riders to the start gate.

01:15:15.986 --> 01:15:16.885
All right,
you all stretched out?

01:15:17.018 --> 01:15:18.254
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:15:20.357 --> 01:15:22.558
Hey, Junior,
I got sponsors for today,

01:15:22.692 --> 01:15:24.293
but sponsorship bonuses,

01:15:24.427 --> 01:15:26.496
that's the only way
we can keep this thing going.

01:15:28.129 --> 01:15:29.298
Show us what you got.

01:15:35.272 --> 01:15:36.939
[announcer] This is one
of our biggest turnouts

01:15:37.072 --> 01:15:38.206
for a season opener.

01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:40.209
Over 20,000 spectators
here today

01:15:40.343 --> 01:15:41.943
to see which one
of these riders

01:15:42.077 --> 01:15:45.747
will take home
the $25,000 purse.

01:15:45.881 --> 01:15:46.781
- [cheering]
- [Marshall] Thank you.

01:15:46.915 --> 01:15:48.684
Thank you. Appreciate it.

01:15:48.817 --> 01:15:51.119
Listen, Bennett, we came here
to win this thing,

01:15:51.253 --> 01:15:52.822
me and my brother, one-two.

01:15:52.955 --> 01:15:54.423
So you just stay
out of our way.

01:15:54.557 --> 01:15:56.992
Yeah, I watched you
during qualifying, Chris.

01:15:57.126 --> 01:15:59.595
So you know, we got you beat
by over four seconds.

01:15:59.728 --> 01:16:03.032
What I know is you're
a carbon copy of your brother.

01:16:03.165 --> 01:16:05.267
And that's why I'm gonna
yard your ass, too.

01:16:08.370 --> 01:16:09.170
Move.

01:16:09.304 --> 01:16:10.272
[laughs]

01:16:19.381 --> 01:16:22.651
Marshall Bennett, number 32,
he's the guy to watch.

01:16:22.785 --> 01:16:24.353
I thought he was injured.

01:16:24.487 --> 01:16:26.455
Sir, tracers and IEDs
in Afghanistan

01:16:26.589 --> 01:16:28.725
couldn't keep this man
from riding.

01:16:28.857 --> 01:16:31.260
Just think about giving him your support
when he takes the podium, all right?

01:16:31.861 --> 01:16:33.396
- All right.
- Thanks.

01:16:34.731 --> 01:16:36.066
Oh, sir, excuse me!

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.782
[announcer] You know, Bennett is
a new addition to Team Panterra.

01:16:53.916 --> 01:16:55.517
Not sure what his chances are.

01:16:55.652 --> 01:16:58.220
He took a four-year hiatus
from motocross to go serve,

01:16:58.353 --> 01:16:59.388
and he came back injured.

01:16:59.522 --> 01:17:01.057
All right, buddy, it's all you.

01:17:01.191 --> 01:17:01.992
[announcer] So I'm
surprised he's even here.

01:17:02.125 --> 01:17:03.292
Go do it.

01:17:03.425 --> 01:17:05.027
[co-announcer]
Well, and apparently

01:17:05.161 --> 01:17:06.462
there's lots of bad blood
between Team Panterra

01:17:06.594 --> 01:17:08.463
and that former rider
of theirs, Chris Walker.

01:17:08.598 --> 01:17:10.166
[Kurt] You just get
to the front.

01:17:10.299 --> 01:17:12.268
I'll bury anyone who comes up.

01:17:19.508 --> 01:17:21.177
All right,
with two minutes to go.

01:17:21.309 --> 01:17:24.780
There's our top qualifier,
Justin Muscutt, number 14.

01:17:24.914 --> 01:17:26.349
He's looking very confident.

01:17:26.948 --> 01:17:28.351
- Hey.
- How'd it go?

01:17:28.483 --> 01:17:29.952
Uh, great. I talked
to eight different sponsors,

01:17:30.085 --> 01:17:31.820
E3 Spark Plugs seems
the most promising.

01:17:31.955 --> 01:17:33.657
- E3? They're good.
- Yeah, I know.

01:17:34.156 --> 01:17:35.691
Good job.

01:17:35.825 --> 01:17:37.327
All right, here we go, guys.

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.063
[engine revving]

01:17:52.075 --> 01:17:53.476
All right,
with 30 seconds to go,

01:17:53.608 --> 01:17:55.978
this Pro Motocross Championship
at Glen Helen

01:17:56.112 --> 01:17:57.347
is about to kick off.

01:17:57.479 --> 01:17:59.014
[cheering]

01:18:12.827 --> 01:18:16.098
[co-announcer] Revs are up
and the gate is down!

01:18:18.168 --> 01:18:19.335
- [Sophie] Go!
- [Cyrus] Let's go!

01:18:30.979 --> 01:18:32.214
[co-announcer] Ooh!

01:18:32.348 --> 01:18:34.082
Massive bottleneck
coming out of turn one!

01:18:34.215 --> 01:18:37.120
[announcer] Multiple wipeouts.
That's gonna thin the herd a lot.

01:18:37.253 --> 01:18:38.821
You know, that first turn
always shows you

01:18:38.954 --> 01:18:40.689
who wants the bigger house.

01:18:42.892 --> 01:18:46.062
[announcer] Chris Walker's already
making his way to the front of pack.

01:18:50.767 --> 01:18:52.501
As they round
the Yamaha Bridge,

01:18:52.634 --> 01:18:55.237
48 and 14 are leading the race!

01:19:00.043 --> 01:19:02.911
Moving up mid-pack is
number 32, Marshall Bennett.

01:19:03.045 --> 01:19:04.114
Yeah.

01:19:06.281 --> 01:19:08.016
[announcer]
And number 14 takes the lead

01:19:08.151 --> 01:19:09.786
as they descend Mt. St. Helen.

01:19:18.326 --> 01:19:20.595
[co-announcer] Oh, Bennett and
Foster get into a little tangle

01:19:20.729 --> 01:19:22.665
as they round
the backside bridge.

01:19:33.041 --> 01:19:35.777
[announcer] Number eight, Chris
Walker's putting down a strong first lap

01:19:35.911 --> 01:19:37.679
as he comes out of the canyon.

01:19:37.812 --> 01:19:40.282
His brother, Kurt, is not far
behind, getting some massive air.

01:19:40.415 --> 01:19:42.217
[spectators cheering]

01:19:46.955 --> 01:19:48.623
[co-announcer] Number 32,
Marshall Bennett,

01:19:48.758 --> 01:19:49.759
is also holding his own

01:19:49.892 --> 01:19:52.295
as he gets some hang time
in the canyon.

01:19:54.464 --> 01:19:55.698
[announcer] Number 88,
Kurt Walker,

01:19:55.831 --> 01:19:58.401
passes 79
heading into the back straight.

01:20:10.045 --> 01:20:12.849
[co-announcer] Man,
this competition is intense.

01:20:15.384 --> 01:20:17.253
[announcer] That's
a tight first lap, folks.

01:20:19.054 --> 01:20:20.455
[co-announcer] We got a lot of
good riders here today.

01:20:20.589 --> 01:20:22.525
This could be anybody's race.

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:26.762
[Marshall grunts]

01:20:26.894 --> 01:20:28.430
Come on, baby, go!

01:20:41.777 --> 01:20:42.645
[chuckles]

01:20:46.281 --> 01:20:49.952
[co-announcer] Oh, look at Chris
Walker, just charging past 121.

01:20:50.085 --> 01:20:53.523
[announcer] Number 14, Justin
Muscutt, continues to lead this race.

01:20:57.692 --> 01:20:59.461
[co-announcer] Eighty-eight,
Kurt Walker, is on fire,

01:20:59.594 --> 01:21:02.497
moving into third place
as he laps number 58.

01:21:02.631 --> 01:21:04.433
I'm telling you,
there's gonna be at least one Walker

01:21:04.567 --> 01:21:05.869
on the podium today.

01:21:07.003 --> 01:21:09.271
[announcer] Oh!
Forty-eight takes a nasty spill

01:21:09.405 --> 01:21:11.340
as Bennett closes in
on the leader.

01:21:26.254 --> 01:21:28.890
Coming around for lap nine
is race leader, number 14,

01:21:29.023 --> 01:21:32.061
with the Team Irongrip
Walker brothers gaining ground.

01:21:32.195 --> 01:21:34.363
[co-announcer] And right behind
them is Marshall Bennett.

01:21:35.897 --> 01:21:37.332
Yes! Go, baby!

01:21:50.479 --> 01:21:51.781
[co-announcer]
Just look at Marshall Bennett.

01:21:51.914 --> 01:21:53.983
He's found his groove.
He's tearing it up.

01:21:54.116 --> 01:21:56.419
Bennett is now right on the
heels of the pack leaders

01:21:56.552 --> 01:21:58.521
as he comes around turn one!

01:22:02.657 --> 01:22:04.259
[co-announcer] Bennett is
clearly looking to pass

01:22:04.393 --> 01:22:05.861
as they approach
the backside bridge.

01:22:08.296 --> 01:22:11.400
[announcer] Oh!
Bennett goes wide and passes Kurt Walker!

01:22:11.534 --> 01:22:12.601
[co-announcer] What a move
by Bennett!

01:22:12.735 --> 01:22:14.001
I did not see that coming.

01:22:14.135 --> 01:22:15.838
He is now in third place.

01:22:26.014 --> 01:22:26.982
[Marshall] Almost got ya.

01:22:41.798 --> 01:22:44.133
[announcer] Kurt's looking to
take back that number-three spot,

01:22:44.265 --> 01:22:45.233
chasing down Bennett,

01:22:45.367 --> 01:22:46.768
looking to make a move.

01:22:56.879 --> 01:22:58.280
[Marshall grunts]

01:22:58.414 --> 01:23:00.515
[co-announcer] Oh!
And Kurt Walker block-passes Bennett,

01:23:00.650 --> 01:23:02.418
- knocking him off his bike.
- [Kurt laughing]

01:23:02.951 --> 01:23:04.052
Oh, man.

01:23:04.186 --> 01:23:06.656
[announcer]
<i>An aggressive play by 88.</i>

01:23:09.991 --> 01:23:11.760
Bennett scrambles to get
back in the race,

01:23:11.893 --> 01:23:14.896
but he's losing positions
every second that goes by.

01:23:15.031 --> 01:23:16.299
Too bad for Bennett.

01:23:30.045 --> 01:23:31.546
[co-announcer]
Bennett's back on his bike,

01:23:31.679 --> 01:23:33.782
but he's got a lot of distance
to make up.

01:23:36.486 --> 01:23:39.555
[announcer] Only three laps left,
and 14's still leading this race,

01:23:39.687 --> 01:23:42.658
with Irongrip's Kurt
and Chris Walker closing in.

01:23:45.227 --> 01:23:47.963
[co-announcer] Back in eighth place,
Bennett's inching his way forward.

01:23:48.097 --> 01:23:49.499
He hasn't given up yet.

01:24:02.044 --> 01:24:04.347
[announcer] Look at this,
Chris lets his brother by.

01:24:04.479 --> 01:24:07.015
Kurt is charging race leader
Justin Muscutt.

01:24:14.557 --> 01:24:15.825
[co-announcer] Two laps to go

01:24:15.957 --> 01:24:18.027
and Kurt Walker
is just bearing down on 14.

01:24:27.937 --> 01:24:30.707
[announcer] Kurt's reeled him in.
He dives in for the pass.

01:24:31.772 --> 01:24:32.607
[co-announcer] Oh, contact!

01:24:32.741 --> 01:24:34.075
Muscutt's off the track!

01:24:34.343 --> 01:24:36.378
Yes.

01:24:36.510 --> 01:24:38.714
[announcer] Kurt Walker now has the lead
with his younger brother just behind.

01:24:38.847 --> 01:24:41.084
Looks like Team Irongrip
has this.

01:24:46.688 --> 01:24:49.357
Don, check out this battle
going on at the backside bridge.

01:24:49.491 --> 01:24:51.659
Marshall Bennett moves up
two more spots.

01:24:51.794 --> 01:24:52.995
He's back in third place!

01:24:57.131 --> 01:24:59.936
The white flag is out!
It's the final lap.

01:25:03.237 --> 01:25:05.173
That's how you do it!

01:25:05.307 --> 01:25:08.577
[co-announcer] Oh, look at this, Gordon.
Bennett is hot on their heels.

01:25:19.054 --> 01:25:20.990
[announcer] The Walkers
round the Yamaha Bridge,

01:25:21.122 --> 01:25:22.657
and 32 is closing in!

01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:24.159
[co-announcer]
He is a man on a mission.

01:25:24.293 --> 01:25:25.161
You got it!

01:25:29.697 --> 01:25:31.166
Come on, Marshall.

01:25:36.405 --> 01:25:38.206
[Marshall] I'm back.

01:25:38.339 --> 01:25:40.708
[announcer] Thirty-two has made
his way back. I can't believe it!

01:25:40.843 --> 01:25:42.510
[co-announcer] I don't think
he's gonna settle for third.

01:25:42.644 --> 01:25:44.112
- Go, go, go. Get 'em!
- Come on!

01:25:48.817 --> 01:25:50.619
[announcer] Oh. Bennett
passes Kurt Walker again.

01:25:50.753 --> 01:25:52.588
That has got to piss Kurt off.

01:26:06.469 --> 01:26:08.571
Whoa! Eighty-eight
takes a dive!

01:26:08.704 --> 01:26:10.104
[announcer]
Bennett's now in second place.

01:26:10.238 --> 01:26:11.138
It's the final stretch!

01:26:11.272 --> 01:26:13.442
Can he catch Chris Walker?

01:26:17.245 --> 01:26:18.747
Come on.

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:20.147
[co-announcer]
Checkered flag is out!

01:26:20.281 --> 01:26:21.450
Come on, baby!

01:26:37.331 --> 01:26:39.968
He did it! Bennett
strokes under Chris Walker!

01:26:40.102 --> 01:26:42.205
I don't think
that's ever been done before!

01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:47.743
Oh, my God, and Chris almost
loses it on the landing!

01:26:47.875 --> 01:26:49.244
Oh, we're screwed.

01:26:53.948 --> 01:26:54.817
Whoa!

01:26:56.619 --> 01:26:58.019
Marshall Bennett is the winner

01:26:58.152 --> 01:27:01.057
of the Lucas Oil Pro
Championship at Glen Helen.

01:27:05.294 --> 01:27:06.595
That's my boy.

01:27:16.338 --> 01:27:17.607
Yes!

01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:40.897
- I knew you could do it!
- Yeah! Yeah!

01:27:57.646 --> 01:27:58.915
[Marshall] <i>This is yours, man.</i>

01:27:59.048 --> 01:28:01.617
- Are you serious?
- Panterra's gone pro.

01:28:05.454 --> 01:28:06.656
Thanks, buddy.

01:28:13.428 --> 01:28:15.264
Hey, Marshall, you mind
if we do a quick interview?

01:28:15.397 --> 01:28:16.265
Yeah.

01:28:18.634 --> 01:28:21.369
So, Marshall, halfway through the
race, you went off the track.

01:28:21.503 --> 01:28:23.671
Did you think you were gonna
be able to come back?

01:28:23.805 --> 01:28:26.909
I had no idea,
but I had to try.

01:28:28.344 --> 01:28:30.346
