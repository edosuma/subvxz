00:37.571 --> 00:39.380
Why do you hesitate, sir?

00:40.240 --> 00:42.015
I know you received the letter.

00:48.916 --> 00:53.189
You know how many swindlers
in this city nail up a sign,

00:53.487 --> 00:57.168
call themselves the "Resistance"
and come begging for cash?

00:57.827 --> 00:59.665
Why should I trust you?

01:03.008 --> 01:06.585
How can you compare us to such thieves?

01:06.867 --> 01:09.202
Take this thing you wanted

01:10.339 --> 01:12.916
and support Korea's independence.

01:19.346 --> 01:20.584
It's a fake.

01:21.285 --> 01:22.590
Is this some kind of prank?

01:22.950 --> 01:23.894
Sir...

01:23.895 --> 01:25.261
This old man is going blind!

01:26.186 --> 01:29.761
I was told this was a done
deal, why drag your feet?

01:35.696 --> 01:36.862
Then...

01:37.772 --> 01:40.543
why did you arrive so early?

02:27.848 --> 02:29.521
Listen up, Kim Jang-Ok!

02:30.117 --> 02:33.326
You are completely surrounded,
with no way to escape!

02:33.687 --> 02:35.860
Throw down your weapon and come out!

02:38.592 --> 02:40.128
How's it proceeding?

02:40.961 --> 02:42.338
He's a fierce one.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.296
Still holding out.

02:44.297 --> 02:48.177
What did you expect?
He's a core member of the Resistance.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.690
I'll call on him to surrender once more.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.023
Give me that.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.503
Kim Jang-Ok!

03:12.793 --> 03:13.863
Can you hear me?

03:14.494 --> 03:15.529
It's Lee Jung-Chool!

03:21.234 --> 03:22.907
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

03:23.637 --> 03:24.637
Hold your fire!

03:32.646 --> 03:35.024
I'll go check the surroundings.

03:35.315 --> 03:37.226
Don't make a move until I return.

03:37.227 --> 03:38.924
Are you giving me orders?

03:40.220 --> 03:42.393
Why think of them as my orders?

03:42.923 --> 03:46.996
Chief Higashi ordered us
to capture Kim alive.

03:55.368 --> 03:56.369
Arrest him.

03:57.337 --> 03:58.372
Let's get him!

04:11.952 --> 04:12.952
This way!

04:23.463 --> 04:24.463
Don't shoot!

04:25.265 --> 04:26.573
I said don't shoot!

05:15.415 --> 05:16.415
There he is!

06:44.070 --> 06:45.070
Move back!

06:47.207 --> 06:48.207
Move back!

06:49.075 --> 06:50.075
Back!

06:50.677 --> 06:51.677
Back!

06:52.379 --> 06:53.414
Back!

06:54.948 --> 06:56.120
Everyone move back!

06:56.583 --> 06:57.583
Back!

06:57.951 --> 06:58.951
Back!

07:02.255 --> 07:03.757
Lee Jung-Chool...

07:19.372 --> 07:20.612
Jang-Ok!

07:23.209 --> 07:24.779
It's me, Jung-Chool.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.552
Let's talk it over.

07:28.548 --> 07:30.789
I'll open the door, so don't shoot.

08:02.248 --> 08:05.855
Our leaders betray the nation,
and you betray your compatriots.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.829
So are you living comfortably?

08:09.756 --> 08:11.429
Dirty traitors.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.972
You think we'll ever
win back independence?

08:16.863 --> 08:18.774
We are a sinking ship.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.306
Indeed.

08:22.435 --> 08:25.382
And rats are the first
to flee a sinking ship.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.217
Come out with me.

08:35.280 --> 08:36.953
Then you can live.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.554
Preserve your life at least.

08:42.989 --> 08:45.663
People shouldn't live among rats.

08:46.993 --> 08:47.993
Drop your gun!

08:49.329 --> 08:51.030
Long live Korea.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.031
Jang-Ok...

09:09.182 --> 09:13.494
POLICE BUREAU
OF JAPANESE HEADQUARTERS IN KOREA

09:25.165 --> 09:27.702
KIM JANG-OK

09:28.868 --> 09:30.848
<i>Deceased</i>

09:41.247 --> 09:42.282
Have a seat.

09:49.622 --> 09:51.033
It's genuine.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.236
They must've needed cash urgently.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.572
We should've captured Kim alive!

10:02.535 --> 10:04.742
This operation was a failure!

10:09.943 --> 10:11.310
Was he your friend?

10:11.311 --> 10:12.551
No, sir.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.628
Well, that's okay.

10:19.619 --> 10:23.260
Who can you call a friend in this age?

10:24.557 --> 10:28.437
Whoever offers a hand first is a friend.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.903
Our headquarters expects much of you!

10:35.101 --> 10:39.015
This figure will lead you
to the Resistance.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.446
We're counting on you!

10:59.692 --> 11:00.692
Let him go.

11:09.269 --> 11:14.014
SAMPANTONG RICKSHAW GARAGE
(BASE OF THE RESISTANCE)

11:14.841 --> 11:15.841
Where's Joo?

11:33.860 --> 11:37.706
After losing Jang-Ok,
they ended up only getting Joo.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.832
But just a day after he was caught,
Lee Jung-Chool released him.

11:40.833 --> 11:41.833
Lee Jung-Chool?

11:42.235 --> 11:44.069
The new Korean police captain.

11:44.070 --> 11:46.346
He worked briefly with
the Provisional Government in Shanghai.

11:46.347 --> 11:48.979
Then he leaked intel
to the Japanese police.

11:49.475 --> 11:51.887
For that, he rose
to become police captain.

11:52.178 --> 11:53.885
He's rotten to the core.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.851
He built good connections
working as an interpreter,

11:56.852 --> 11:58.886
but that was all just
to sell information.

11:58.887 --> 12:01.764
He must've released Joo as bait.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.890
Wait, have we been exposed?

12:04.891 --> 12:07.770
No, we took the long route here.

12:08.194 --> 12:09.229
No one followed us.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.542
So what do we do about Joo?

12:11.931 --> 12:15.105
If he won't confess
after all our pressure, it's no use.

12:15.668 --> 12:18.012
Just send him away.
It's not worth the effort.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.511
Let's do this.

12:31.718 --> 12:33.891
You walked out of that hell unharmed?

12:34.187 --> 12:37.760
I have no idea how it happened.
They told me to go, so I went.

12:38.057 --> 12:39.866
Lee Jung-Chool ordered you set free!

12:40.126 --> 12:41.693
No, comrades!

12:41.694 --> 12:43.970
Jang-Ok's actions
were leaked from our side!

12:44.230 --> 12:47.643
It's not me! It's really not me!

12:48.301 --> 12:52.272
Selling your compatriot
for a few coins, damn you!

12:52.538 --> 12:54.609
Why do you only suspect me?

12:55.908 --> 12:57.909
I don't know Lee Jung-Chool!

12:57.910 --> 13:00.891
I don't even know who he is, really!

13:05.151 --> 13:07.825
Only the three of us knew
about the visit that night.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.930
How did the police find out?

13:11.624 --> 13:13.160
Speak before I count to three.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.504
Or I'll shatter your skull.

13:16.629 --> 13:17.503
One.

13:17.504 --> 13:18.504
Who ratted on us?

13:18.831 --> 13:20.242
This isn't fair!

13:20.500 --> 13:22.907
I risked my life taking a bomb
to Central Police Station!

13:22.908 --> 13:24.404
How can you suspect me?

13:24.737 --> 13:27.411
- Two!
- Th-This is insane!

13:27.974 --> 13:29.783
Why only me?

13:30.310 --> 13:32.483
Can you all prove you aren't spies?

13:34.514 --> 13:36.014
C-C-C-Comrade!

13:36.015 --> 13:37.015
Three!

13:50.430 --> 13:51.430
Joo...

13:54.267 --> 13:56.543
Don't you know why they let you go?

13:57.503 --> 14:00.541
If you want to live, stay
away from both us and them.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.388
Leave Seoul now.

14:17.957 --> 14:19.129
Comrade...

14:21.394 --> 14:23.374
This is really hard for me.

14:30.136 --> 14:32.173
With their sources of cash blocked,

14:33.306 --> 14:36.515
the Resistance have started
selling precious objects.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.153
Do you know who's behind it?

14:39.812 --> 14:40.882
Yes, I do.

14:41.347 --> 14:46.558
The son of a fake painter,
an old classmate of Jo Hwe-Ryung.

14:46.919 --> 14:48.592
His name's Kim Woo-Jin.

14:49.188 --> 14:52.601
Runs a photography and antique shop
with his brother.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.768
People say they raise money
and send it to Shanghai.

14:57.997 --> 15:01.410
But why does the Resistance
suddenly need so much money?

15:02.235 --> 15:03.771
What are they planning?

15:04.437 --> 15:06.678
Might be a false rumor...

15:09.442 --> 15:11.683
but they're said to be buying explosives.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.116
According to my source in Shanghai...

15:16.048 --> 15:19.393
they're trying to contact
explosives experts from Hungary.

15:19.852 --> 15:21.525
Any news for me?

15:21.721 --> 15:27.569
Yes, I think I've uncovered
the Resistance's plan to raise money.

15:27.860 --> 15:32.741
It's led by core members
Jo Hwe-Ryung and Kim Woo-Jin

15:33.566 --> 15:35.978
who recently arrived in Seoul.

15:36.202 --> 15:38.307
Good.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.883
Find out if there's anyone
we can befriend.

15:42.141 --> 15:46.283
Introduce them to wealthy patrons,
or give them travel passes,

15:46.284 --> 15:49.658
since that's what they need the most.

15:49.882 --> 15:51.555
Yes, sir!

15:52.718 --> 15:54.459
From now on, you'll work with Hashimoto.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.399
At your service.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.064
I'll do my best.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.992
The two of us? I...

16:00.993 --> 16:03.803
There's nothing I won't do
to assist Captain Lee.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.501
I'm at your command.

16:08.134 --> 16:12.605
Hashimoto is pursuing Jung Che-San,
the leader of the Resistance.

16:13.072 --> 16:16.645
Share your intel with him.

16:17.343 --> 16:21.849
You two try to find some bait
that can lure Che-San.

16:23.349 --> 16:27.652
Your time has come
to prove your true worth.

16:27.653 --> 16:30.327
Captain Lee excels at this.

16:31.090 --> 16:33.425
Hashimoto, learn from him.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.496
Yes, sir!

16:39.665 --> 16:43.010
Have you heard of Yeon Gye-Soon
from China?

16:43.870 --> 16:47.317
She's a member of the Resistance
who acts as Che-San's secretary.

16:47.974 --> 16:51.012
She recently arrived in Seoul,

16:51.310 --> 16:54.018
but unfortunately, no one knows her face.

16:55.515 --> 17:00.692
If we catch her,
we'll have Che-San by the neck.

17:02.722 --> 17:05.464
YOUNGSAENG PHOTO & ANTIQUES SHOP
(SAFE HOUSE OF THE RESISTANCE)

17:14.834 --> 17:16.575
ls everything ready?

17:17.403 --> 17:21.010
Yes, you stay here. I can go myself.

17:21.641 --> 17:22.915
You'll go alone?

17:23.809 --> 17:25.253
Stay here this time.

17:26.311 --> 17:28.189
Wait until I deliver it.

17:29.081 --> 17:30.526
Things are too tense these days.

17:31.017 --> 17:32.017
It's dangerous.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.726
Are you... worried about me?

17:36.656 --> 17:38.693
Worried for you as a comrade.

17:40.927 --> 17:42.065
Comrade...

17:44.530 --> 17:47.568
Can you please take a photo
of your comrade?

17:48.200 --> 17:49.543
This is sudden.

17:50.169 --> 17:52.342
You've never photographed me.

17:54.340 --> 17:57.219
I'd like to keep it.

18:30.376 --> 18:32.413
One, two...

18:51.497 --> 18:52.771
How can I help you?

18:55.501 --> 18:57.174
Mr. Kim Woo-Jin?

18:57.737 --> 19:00.081
I'm Kim Woo-Jin.

19:03.909 --> 19:08.289
I've come across a precious object,
would you take a look at it?

19:12.084 --> 19:14.428
Yes, come upstairs.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.049
Do you know where it was made?

19:35.608 --> 19:37.281
Is it genuine?

19:43.282 --> 19:45.023
Let me take a look.

20:03.135 --> 20:05.513
You must've gone to that
cheapskate downtown.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.243
What a fraud he is.

20:08.841 --> 20:09.979
What do you mean?

20:11.677 --> 20:12.985
I mean it's a fake.

20:14.380 --> 20:17.361
Of course, only experts like me
can tell the difference.

20:19.385 --> 20:20.659
Really?

20:23.589 --> 20:25.865
I got it from a trustworthy source.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.764
Wait here a moment.

20:58.624 --> 21:00.103
Which one is genuine?

21:08.234 --> 21:09.611
They're exactly the same.

21:11.370 --> 21:14.112
One is 200 years old,
and the other one was made this spring.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.546
I've a pottery factory in Shanghai

21:16.547 --> 21:19.079
that makes antiques
out of cracked chamber pots.

21:19.945 --> 21:20.945
What?

21:21.480 --> 21:22.714
That's fraud.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.888
All originals have fakes.

21:25.251 --> 21:26.662
It's all just to meet demand.

21:27.386 --> 21:30.799
- You must rake in cash.
- Raking's not enough. I sweep it in.

21:31.056 --> 21:32.056
I'm envious.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.900
What work do you do
to envy a merchant like me?

21:37.163 --> 21:39.302
Police Bureau Captain Lee Jung-Chool.

21:42.401 --> 21:45.780
Forgive my rudeness!
Let me formally introduce myself.

21:46.572 --> 21:47.812
I'm Kim Woo-Jin.

21:48.607 --> 21:50.018
I didn't know who you were.

21:54.580 --> 21:57.527
<i>Kim Woo-Jin Shanghai Pottery Factory</i>
But what could a police captain possibly envy?

21:57.528 --> 21:59.792
But what could a police
captain possibly envy?

22:00.286 --> 22:03.290
What's so exciting
about living off a salary?

22:03.291 --> 22:05.963
Still, a peddler like me can't compare.

22:10.095 --> 22:11.095
By any chance...

22:13.032 --> 22:18.380
do you have connections
with the Japanese police in Shanghai?

22:18.938 --> 22:22.373
I could if I wanted to.
I spent time in Shanghai.

22:22.374 --> 22:23.785
Really?

22:24.610 --> 22:26.317
Then could I ask you a favor?

22:29.615 --> 22:32.391
I have products coming from Shanghai.

22:32.952 --> 22:36.124
I'm just a merchant, not some
Korean Resistance fundraiser,

22:36.125 --> 22:39.898
but misunderstandings block my
shipments and cause embarrassment.

22:42.394 --> 22:44.704
A small request like that...

22:45.698 --> 22:47.302
If you buy me a drink?

22:51.503 --> 22:55.474
Are you interested in business,
Captain Lee?

22:59.411 --> 23:00.913
Is it lucrative?

23:01.513 --> 23:06.326
How about a serious talk
about business over a drink?

23:07.419 --> 23:08.419
Right now?

23:08.721 --> 23:09.927
What do you say?

23:12.057 --> 23:13.057
Let's go.

23:18.430 --> 23:20.501
So you have quite a history.

23:24.036 --> 23:27.272
Jang-Ok and I are from the same hometown,

23:27.273 --> 23:29.844
and he and you worked together
in the Resistance,

23:29.845 --> 23:32.550
so you and I have a connection, as well!

23:34.346 --> 23:37.715
After interpreting for the Resistance,

23:37.716 --> 23:40.390
how'd you end up
with the Japanese police?

23:41.954 --> 23:44.560
You never know where life leads you.

23:45.024 --> 23:48.626
People are loyal to those
who look after them.

23:48.627 --> 23:52.871
My current chief showed a particular
interest, so I ended up there.

23:54.133 --> 23:59.776
It was good with Jang-Ok in Shanghai.
I thought we had a lot in common.

24:02.908 --> 24:05.047
I held Jang-Ok's toe in my hand.

24:08.247 --> 24:09.920
"It's so light."

24:10.649 --> 24:13.151
That's all I could think.

24:13.152 --> 24:15.257
Hey, I knew it.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.289
You...

24:18.057 --> 24:21.630
You're not a harsh person.
I knew from the start.

24:21.994 --> 24:25.441
If things had gone differently,
you'd have been a poet!

24:26.832 --> 24:28.243
Drink up.

24:28.968 --> 24:29.968
Yes.

24:30.469 --> 24:31.914
I will.

24:33.439 --> 24:35.112
I'll call you brother from now on.

24:35.841 --> 24:37.343
If you like.

24:37.943 --> 24:40.253
Whatever you want.

24:48.354 --> 24:49.765
Thanks for the drinks.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.990
Yes, yes.

24:51.991 --> 24:52.969
Brother...

24:52.970 --> 24:54.826
Thanks.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.135
Have a good night!

24:56.628 --> 24:57.766
Good-bye!

25:02.668 --> 25:04.170
Good night, Brother!

25:10.142 --> 25:11.951
TELEPHONE

25:51.517 --> 25:55.226
Operator, this is Police Captain
Lee Jung-Chool, get me my office.

26:00.192 --> 26:01.227
Sa-Hee!

26:01.560 --> 26:05.440
Don't come to work tomorrow,
go get the package in Sampantong.

26:09.668 --> 26:11.875
It's important, so be careful with it.

26:19.845 --> 26:23.948
<i>Japanese police are closing in.</i>

26:23.949 --> 26:31.189
<i>Lee Jung-Chool who worked with us
in Shanghai approached me.</i>

26:31.190 --> 26:39.190
<i>If our organization is exposed,
we'll regroup in Shanghai.</i>

26:43.068 --> 26:45.139
Contents of Captain Lee's telephone call.

26:49.108 --> 26:52.612
Sampantong, nine o'clock, Cacadew.

27:18.170 --> 27:20.844
So if the Resistance comes into Seoul,

27:21.240 --> 27:23.186
we can expect them
to move between these points.

27:23.175 --> 27:23.653
SEOUL CITY MAP

27:23.654 --> 27:25.849
SEOUL CITY MAP
Sacred Heart Nunnery.

SEOUL CITY MAP

27:26.912 --> 27:27.786

Youngsaeng Photo Shop.

27:27.787 --> 27:28.787
Youngsaeng Photo Shop.

27:29.414 --> 27:33.624
Kim Woo-Jin, you scoundrel.
I knew it. He's their center.

27:34.286 --> 27:37.424
These are the movements
of the Resistance's rickshaw drivers.

27:37.425 --> 27:40.631
What's important is that it matches
Kim Jang-Ok's movements.

27:44.796 --> 27:46.332
Why has this been opened?

27:47.266 --> 27:49.143
Did you show it to anyone?

27:54.473 --> 27:55.473
Sa-Hee!

28:07.352 --> 28:11.389
When I left the cafe,
Captain Hashimoto was waiting.

28:11.390 --> 28:14.064
He said we had to share intelligence...

28:15.561 --> 28:16.733
Ready my car!

28:17.029 --> 28:18.029
Yes, sir!

28:19.865 --> 28:22.900
Go to the photo shop.
Before Hashimoto swoops in.

28:22.901 --> 28:23.901
Yes!

28:26.171 --> 28:27.206
Sacred Heart Nunnery.

28:35.914 --> 28:38.149
Excuse me, cart driver!

28:38.150 --> 28:39.150
Yes?

28:45.490 --> 28:48.926
There's a package inside,
can you load it for me?

28:48.927 --> 28:50.065
- Yes.
- Thanks.

29:06.845 --> 29:08.756
Is this the package?

29:29.935 --> 29:34.543
<i>The network is exposed.
Beware of Hashimoto.</i>

30:24.523 --> 30:26.264
I said, "Capture him alive"!

30:36.435 --> 30:39.109
Sister! The Japanese police
are at the gate!

30:41.340 --> 30:46.153
Hurry and open up!

31:04.363 --> 31:05.398
Be careful.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.040
Yes, sir!

31:51.176 --> 31:55.886
You idiot, you couldn't catch
even one of the girls at the nunnery?

31:56.181 --> 32:01.185
I said, "Keep your movements secret"!

32:01.186 --> 32:04.531
You call yourself a policeman
of the Great Japanese Empire?

32:07.759 --> 32:08.759
I'm sorry.

32:13.899 --> 32:15.037
Who is this?

32:15.400 --> 32:20.406
I-I am your i-informant.

32:23.108 --> 32:24.314
Captain Hashimoto...

32:25.377 --> 32:27.448
Chief Higashi is calling you.

32:51.102 --> 32:54.447
Why don't you tell the whole town...

32:55.974 --> 32:58.853
you're an undercover policeman?

33:02.447 --> 33:03.858
You useless fool...

33:07.319 --> 33:09.265
Take it easy, will you?

33:12.757 --> 33:14.168
I don't catch your meaning.

33:15.927 --> 33:18.134
When you're with me, speak Korean.

33:21.132 --> 33:26.172
I barely managed to approach them,
so why did you run wild and scare them off?

33:26.638 --> 33:29.278
Do we have to catch them in order?

33:29.841 --> 33:32.048
If they're close,
grab them before they run.

33:37.349 --> 33:41.820
Shouldn't you rather try to find out
how police intel was leaked?

33:49.060 --> 33:50.334
You are...

33:52.497 --> 33:54.408
challenging me, aren't you?

33:57.736 --> 34:00.740
We received intel
that Che-San entered Shanghai.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.747
He's meeting
with explosives experts there.

34:06.311 --> 34:07.311
Yes, sir!

34:07.846 --> 34:11.760
The Resistance is also streaming
out of Seoul for Shanghai.

34:12.050 --> 34:15.088
Antiques dealer Kim Woo-Jin
vanished this morning...

34:15.089 --> 34:18.022
That's because there was...

34:18.023 --> 34:19.195
No need to explain.

34:19.824 --> 34:22.059
Find him as soon as you can.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.540
Use all your contacts in Shanghai.

34:25.196 --> 34:28.699
If the Resistance is calling
explosives experts to Shanghai,

34:29.833 --> 34:32.212
it means they'll target
Japanese Headquarters.

34:33.170 --> 34:36.050
Stop the explosives from entering Seoul.

34:37.409 --> 34:40.049
No time to delay. Go to Shanghai at once!

34:41.446 --> 34:44.016
I'll offer the biggest reward
you've ever seen.

34:44.949 --> 34:47.931
For us, everything is in Shanghai.

34:56.962 --> 34:58.134
Hashimoto.

34:58.530 --> 34:59.530
Yes, sir?

35:34.065 --> 35:38.275
Stay here and report on all intel
Hashimoto sends from Shanghai.

35:38.276 --> 35:41.113
Report directly, not through Sa-Hee?

35:41.406 --> 35:43.750
Anything to do with Che-San,
report directly.

35:44.075 --> 35:45.520
Yes, sir.

35:50.649 --> 35:55.155
SHANGHAI, QINGPU DISTRICT

36:04.162 --> 36:05.197
I'll go.

36:22.647 --> 36:27.494
<i>Are you well? I'm coming
with an urgent matter to discuss.</i>

36:27.786 --> 36:30.995
<i>Please meet me at Shanghai Station.
Regards, Lee Jung-Chool.</i>

36:46.638 --> 36:49.847
We're not even safe here now.

36:50.675 --> 36:53.212
Why don't you wait things out
in Manchuria?

36:54.212 --> 36:58.524
Fighting an unknown enemy
is no simple task.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.821
I feel the same.

37:18.737 --> 37:20.717
What's Lee Jung-Chool like?

37:22.407 --> 37:23.909
Would he be a worthy friend?

37:26.611 --> 37:29.251
He and I are just bait
thrown by fishermen,

37:29.614 --> 37:31.423
so how could we become friends?

37:37.188 --> 37:39.725
Our martyr Jang-Ok spoke of him.

37:40.024 --> 37:41.628
Called him a close friend.

37:42.861 --> 37:44.135
That's all in the past.

37:46.264 --> 37:49.245
Right now, we lack both time and men.

37:58.076 --> 37:59.919
Let's take the bait.

38:06.384 --> 38:07.590
Turning a spy...

38:08.586 --> 38:11.726
We make the enemy's spy into our own.

38:13.491 --> 38:15.971
The most dangerous
but rewarding act of intelligence...

38:17.162 --> 38:19.403
is to turn a spy.

38:20.398 --> 38:21.399
I'm against it.

38:22.567 --> 38:25.104
Aren't you their ultimate target?

38:27.272 --> 38:28.683
Isn't it too dangerous?

38:29.607 --> 38:32.178
If it's in a spy's character
to switch sides...

38:34.112 --> 38:36.490
let's see who he stands with this time.

38:38.850 --> 38:41.694
Even a turncoat has only one motherland.

38:43.688 --> 38:45.861
Surely he feels some debt in his heart.

38:46.257 --> 38:47.998
We must open that up.

38:52.030 --> 38:56.672
There's nothing scarier
than feeling a person's emotions.

39:16.187 --> 39:20.033
He'll find it strange to see us
together, so you get off first.

39:35.740 --> 39:37.219
He's here. Smile.

39:43.848 --> 39:45.054
Hey, don't overdo it.

39:45.817 --> 39:48.485
Hey, long time no see!

39:48.486 --> 39:52.059
You must be busy. Great to see you!

40:28.526 --> 40:30.403
I looked into it as you requested.

40:31.029 --> 40:36.377
There are Hungarian anarchists
who know explosives and might help them.

40:37.235 --> 40:40.304
Some of them support Korean independence.

40:40.305 --> 40:41.471
Why?

40:41.472 --> 40:44.282
Because even with no country,
they're forming a government.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.643
You should see the Resistance.

40:47.478 --> 40:52.723
A beggar for a general,
who goes around looking for money.

40:53.718 --> 40:56.062
When can I meet your informant?

40:56.454 --> 40:58.226
After the intel was leaked in Seoul,

40:58.227 --> 41:00.725
the Resistance members are
nervous, so he's lying low.

41:01.926 --> 41:05.669
Informants are supposed to lie low,
and it's our job to find them.

41:05.670 --> 41:09.941
The Resistance believes we
have an informant among them.

41:12.670 --> 41:16.277
You're still following Lee
Jung-Chool's movements?

41:20.244 --> 41:22.850
Shanghai has changed a lot, too.

41:33.958 --> 41:35.096
I've been thinking.

41:36.127 --> 41:40.041
How about I quit my job and
do business here... What do you think?

41:42.600 --> 41:44.978
Now you've come to your senses.

41:45.269 --> 41:47.146
It's a splendid idea.

41:47.605 --> 41:50.311
Betraying your country
brings material comforts,

41:50.312 --> 41:52.549
but the rust in your heart is permanent.

41:52.550 --> 41:54.887
You talk pretty, don't you?

41:55.513 --> 42:00.050
Anyway, my only work here
was with the Provisional Government,

42:00.051 --> 42:02.895
and I've lost contact
with my old friends there.

42:03.187 --> 42:08.058
So I don't know anyone influential
besides the Japanese. So I'm looking for...

42:08.059 --> 42:09.059
Allow me...

42:09.861 --> 42:11.135
to finish that sentence.

42:12.497 --> 42:15.410
An influential Korean
close to the Provisional Government?

42:15.900 --> 42:18.380
How did you know before I even said it?

42:18.669 --> 42:21.341
You're a psychic!
Do I give away too much?

42:21.342 --> 42:24.684
Business is half capital,
half intuition, you know?

42:25.176 --> 42:27.983
Very well.
I don't know who you're seeking,

42:27.984 --> 42:30.391
but I'll find someone
who can connect you.

42:31.015 --> 42:33.552
Oh, you said you wished
to see the pottery factory?

42:33.553 --> 42:35.531
Let's go there now.
It's close to your hotel.

42:35.753 --> 42:37.323
Very good!

42:48.866 --> 42:49.344
FIRECRACKERS
EXPLOSIVE GUNPOWDER

42:49.544 --> 42:50.708
How can I help you?

42:51.341 --> 42:55.238
Did a foreigner buy ingredients
for explosives recently?

42:55.239 --> 42:57.412
We don't deal in real explosives.

42:58.709 --> 43:01.845
We know about your business!

43:01.846 --> 43:04.948
I don't know, get out!

43:04.949 --> 43:08.897
Wait, wait, wait! Get back here!

43:25.803 --> 43:28.647
She said a Hungarian rebel visits often.

43:28.973 --> 43:33.615
An explosives expert working in a
pharmacy in the French Concession.

43:34.312 --> 43:36.952
His wife is Asian.

44:55.059 --> 44:56.800
Let's have French cuisine tomorrow.

44:57.361 --> 44:59.066
How about a drink before bed?

44:59.067 --> 45:02.306
Tonight, sleep off your journey.
And don't forget my request.

45:02.307 --> 45:03.333
What?

45:03.334 --> 45:06.503
Remember? Getting my antiques to Seoul...

45:06.504 --> 45:09.007
Sure, sure!

45:12.476 --> 45:14.183
- Bye now!
- Good night!

45:25.356 --> 45:27.836
Expensive tastes, that one...

47:59.043 --> 48:00.043
Who's there?

48:50.528 --> 48:52.371
What is this at the crack of dawn?

48:53.731 --> 48:55.108
Let's have breakfast.

48:55.900 --> 48:57.038
At this hour?

49:03.974 --> 49:06.386
The early bird catches the worm.

49:06.877 --> 49:10.222
The early bird is the first to get eaten.

50:15.646 --> 50:17.387
Ah, bean curd stew!

50:29.293 --> 50:32.740
Brother, you'll have to do me a big favor.

50:34.231 --> 50:35.733
I told you I'd help.

50:36.534 --> 50:38.571
I'm risking my own neck here.

50:40.070 --> 50:41.674
Oh, I'm scared!

50:42.072 --> 50:46.987
Yes, you should be.
Your neck is at risk, too.

50:48.379 --> 50:50.381
For the cost of this meal?

51:08.198 --> 51:09.871
Is the food to your taste?

51:11.902 --> 51:13.108
Good to meet you.

51:14.238 --> 51:15.838
I'm Jung Che-San, the Resistance leader.

51:22.246 --> 51:25.750
I heard about you from old
Revolutionary Party comrades.

51:27.451 --> 51:31.092
Many of them are still thankful
for what you did, Captain Lee.

51:33.457 --> 51:35.403
I really wanted to meet you.

51:35.726 --> 51:37.899
So I asked for an introduction.

51:39.129 --> 51:40.129
It's an honor.

51:40.397 --> 51:42.274
The honor is mine.

51:42.566 --> 51:47.379
If not for you, how could I ever share
a meal with a Police Bureau captain?

51:49.540 --> 51:53.113
So how could you trust
a Police Bureau captain like me?

51:54.144 --> 51:56.619
Why do you glare? I didn't say anything.

51:56.620 --> 51:59.493
He heard of you during
your time in Shanghai.

52:00.417 --> 52:05.822
As compatriots sharing a meal far from
home, do we need long introductions?

52:05.823 --> 52:07.996
Come, let's eat.

52:09.960 --> 52:12.941
Oh, my. No liquor for our guest?

52:26.310 --> 52:28.645
Are you trying to make me rich?

52:28.646 --> 52:31.621
Placing me nose-to-nose
with the nation's most wanted man!

52:31.622 --> 52:33.322
What kind of scheme is this?

52:33.617 --> 52:35.290
Too young to fear anything, huh?

52:35.586 --> 52:38.192
I let go of my fears and my life long ago.

52:38.489 --> 52:40.366
Why, are you scared?

52:40.991 --> 52:44.438
Didn't you contact me hoping for something
like this? Now you can't handle it?

52:44.828 --> 52:47.206
I could kill Che-San right now.

52:47.364 --> 52:48.775
Give it a try.

52:49.500 --> 52:52.481
If I walk out of here now,
you know what'll happen?

52:53.971 --> 52:57.350
There'll be rumors that a police captain
and Che-San drank all night

52:57.351 --> 52:59.048
and became friends.

53:00.144 --> 53:01.623
Are you blackmailing me?

53:03.447 --> 53:07.054
Don't you understand
what situation you're in? Don't you?

53:08.218 --> 53:10.664
Has Higashi contacted you once
since arriving here?

53:16.527 --> 53:19.167
Why didn't that Japanese cop
tell you of his Shanghai informant?

53:19.863 --> 53:21.467
He wants the reward for himself.

53:22.132 --> 53:25.341
Playing both sides like you do
always ends in ruin.

53:40.517 --> 53:42.997
It's not as much as it looks.

53:47.925 --> 53:51.429
Come, let's drink
and talk of our hometowns.

53:53.063 --> 53:55.873
Contrary to his appearance,
my brother's a weak drinker.

53:57.034 --> 53:58.945
Since when are we brothers?

54:03.540 --> 54:04.540
Here.

54:06.076 --> 54:08.249
- Here. You, too.
- Yes, sir.

54:09.780 --> 54:11.282
Let's all drink.

54:18.088 --> 54:19.465
- Here.
- Thank you.

54:27.097 --> 54:29.043
Here, give me your cups.

54:34.204 --> 54:35.204
Here.

54:37.307 --> 54:38.307
Here.

54:43.247 --> 54:44.247
Here.

54:50.320 --> 54:51.320
Here.

55:03.667 --> 55:05.647
That didn't last long.

55:32.362 --> 55:33.500
Captain Lee...

55:37.801 --> 55:39.610
Do you like night fishing?

55:49.513 --> 55:53.484
Whenever I feel frustrated,
I come out here for night fishing.

55:55.285 --> 55:59.734
Surrounded by this cold darkness,
I forget my fears.

56:00.691 --> 56:02.500
You feel fear?

56:02.793 --> 56:03.863
Of course.

56:06.563 --> 56:08.167
I'm a soldier who lost his country.

56:11.668 --> 56:13.739
Living the meandering life of a runaway,

56:15.205 --> 56:17.651
the one thing I've come to master...

56:18.408 --> 56:20.888
is an animalistic sense for people.

56:22.646 --> 56:24.523
Who will come to my aid,

56:25.315 --> 56:27.317
who will protect my life...

56:28.218 --> 56:30.323
I decide it all by my instinct.

56:34.424 --> 56:36.836
I believed you'd help me.

56:38.095 --> 56:42.840
I'm just a cop on a salary,
going around chasing profit.

56:45.569 --> 56:47.913
I could change my mind.

57:11.695 --> 57:12.695
Captain Lee...

57:15.599 --> 57:17.806
Throw me in the ocean right now.

57:19.736 --> 57:21.807
If that's really what you want...

57:22.873 --> 57:24.147
then do it.

57:24.741 --> 57:26.584
This opportunity won't come again.

57:29.046 --> 57:31.993
How can you trust in yourself so strongly?

57:32.449 --> 57:36.329
I don't trust men's words.
I don't even trust my own.

57:37.287 --> 57:43.101
I just trust in what I must do
and what a person ought to do!

57:47.564 --> 57:53.105
There comes a time for everyone
to choose where to put their names.

57:54.471 --> 57:58.578
To which history will you
add your name, Comrade Lee?

58:17.594 --> 58:18.971
From now on...

58:20.130 --> 58:21.973
my time is in your hands.

58:31.008 --> 58:33.648
Help us. Can't you see we need it?

58:33.944 --> 58:35.044
We're desperate.

58:35.045 --> 58:38.618
You talk too damn much!
What do you expect of me?

58:39.182 --> 58:42.118
We need safe passage to Seoul. That's all.

58:42.119 --> 58:43.723
But there are too many obstacles.

58:44.021 --> 58:48.128
We'll handle what happens after.
We won't cause you trouble.

58:55.532 --> 58:58.172
It's your decision. I won't resent you.

58:59.803 --> 59:02.750
Even if I die with no grave like Jang-Ok,

59:04.074 --> 59:05.917
my ghost will still be loyal.

59:11.181 --> 59:14.253
The next time we meet,
I can't predict what I might do.

59:16.920 --> 59:18.058
Understand?

59:53.590 --> 59:55.467
It's all fake! Crazy fool tried to...

59:55.468 --> 59:59.236
He set up a factory, and now he's come...
now he's...

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:02.236
Hey, Hashimoto!

01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:09.705
It's all fake. Crazy fool
tried to rip me off.

01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:12.619
He set up a factory, and now
he's come over to my side.

01:00:13.743 --> 01:00:15.482
Kim Woo-Jin is going to Tokyo.

01:00:15.483 --> 01:00:18.119
He wants two travel passes.
Who do you think will join him?

01:00:18.882 --> 01:00:20.327
Che-San, of course.

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:23.085
Kim is his Number Two!

01:00:23.086 --> 01:00:25.999
He'll come to the pier tomorrow,
so make two travel passes!

01:00:27.591 --> 01:00:29.332
Is this intel accurate?

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:35.170
Then I'll take the reward for myself.

01:00:39.736 --> 01:00:42.012
If you don't believe me, go check.

01:01:33.156 --> 01:01:34.567
Are you Kang Jong-Gi?

01:01:38.562 --> 01:01:39.836
You see anyone else here?

01:01:41.731 --> 01:01:43.404
Are you sure Che-San is here?

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:54.420
Our goal is to take the
explosives safely to Seoul.

01:02:02.419 --> 01:02:05.400
They're divided among you
according to your disguises.

01:02:06.156 --> 01:02:07.897
The most powerful ones are in that box.

01:02:20.103 --> 01:02:21.103
Where'd he go?

01:02:22.839 --> 01:02:24.011
Damn bastards.

01:02:25.442 --> 01:02:29.584
Whatever happens along the way,
the boxes must reach Seoul.

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:35.725
Better luck next time.

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:50.203
Let's call more men to the pier tomorrow.

01:02:52.235 --> 01:02:53.236
Shall we go?

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:59.051
After safely disembarking in Seoul,

01:02:59.309 --> 01:03:02.449
we'll meet one last time
at our designated rendezvous.

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:20.573
Hur and I will take the boxes
to Antung Station by truck.

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:24.977
From there, Hwe-Ryung
will place them in the freight car.

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:33.780
So travel safely, and
let's meet in Antung.

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:44.988
What's this?

01:03:45.922 --> 01:03:47.663
What happened here?

01:03:50.093 --> 01:03:51.093
Where's Kim Woo-Jin?

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:54.171
We searched the pier,
but he wasn't there.

01:03:56.966 --> 01:03:57.966
What?

01:03:58.868 --> 01:04:01.041
We checked the pier,
but he wasn't there.

01:04:01.042 --> 01:04:02.983
How can you be so careless?

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:05.449
What did your informant say?

01:04:06.276 --> 01:04:08.981
He doesn't know.
Too low in rank, I guess.

01:04:08.982 --> 01:04:12.118
So you've collected intel
from a small fish all this time?

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:16.191
I have another higher up,
but I didn't want to expose him.

01:04:16.192 --> 01:04:19.724
Then you should have told me!
We need to move strategically!

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:22.132
You think it's my decision?

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.904
I'm just following orders from above.

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:29.574
You were told to leave me out?

01:04:30.567 --> 01:04:31.875
On Higashi's order?

01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:35.743
Isn't it true there are problems
with your intel?

01:04:36.005 --> 01:04:37.313
Do I make up the intel?

01:04:37.741 --> 01:04:39.687
If your intel is shit...

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:42.587
change your informants.

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:52.526
Where do you spend your funds?

01:04:53.757 --> 01:04:54.757
What?

01:04:57.727 --> 01:05:00.606
I found out their route.
Not by ship, by train.

01:05:00.607 --> 01:05:01.701
Train?

01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:04.003
To where?

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:08.546
They'll go separately to Antung,
then head for Seoul together.

01:05:08.772 --> 01:05:11.082
What? Are you sure?

01:05:12.442 --> 01:05:14.922
Che-San will risk his life to go to Seoul?

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:16.713
Are you sure of this?

01:05:17.547 --> 01:05:19.948
I'm not sure if Che-San will join them.

01:05:19.949 --> 01:05:20.949
What?

01:05:21.451 --> 01:05:25.593
He's the most important,
but you don't know if he'll go or not?

01:05:26.556 --> 01:05:30.470
According to my source, Kim, Yeon
and the rest of them will split up,

01:05:30.471 --> 01:05:32.728
and then meet in Antung...

01:05:32.729 --> 01:05:35.801
Get out of the car
and report properly, you lout!

01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:39.140
What?

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:41.776
Who cares if the rest of them go to Seoul?

01:05:41.777 --> 01:05:43.580
I'm asking where Che-San is going!

01:05:43.581 --> 01:05:45.307
We're not sure yet.

01:05:45.308 --> 01:05:46.809
Who's giving you this crappy intel?

01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:49.882
It's... a member of the team
traveling to Seoul.

01:05:49.883 --> 01:05:53.417
Wouldn't a team member know
if Che-San's going?

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:57.659
No one in the Resistance knows
Che-San's route in advance.

01:05:57.660 --> 01:06:00.635
His course is only told
just before he departs.

01:06:01.324 --> 01:06:03.895
So who the hell is giving you that intel?

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:07.135
That's enough. We can't tell you now.

01:06:07.664 --> 01:06:10.975
Okay, look into the leader's route.
We must hurry.

01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:13.412
What if the intel is wrong?

01:06:13.837 --> 01:06:16.909
If so, we'll lose all of them
and return with nothing!

01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:19.274
No. This time it's certain.

01:06:19.275 --> 01:06:21.312
This source is completely reliable.

01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:25.616
We promised him a big reward.
It's the person who got us Jang-Ok.

01:06:26.616 --> 01:06:30.496
And thanks to that source,
we're right on Che-San's heels.

01:06:30.854 --> 01:06:33.664
Come, we'd better hurry.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.741
ANTUNG STATION

01:07:26.187 --> 01:07:30.317
<i>The train departing for Seoul
will leave at 10 pm.</i>

01:07:43.593 --> 01:07:49.271
<i>The train departing for Seoul
will leave in 30 minutes.</i>

01:08:00.777 --> 01:08:01.777
Hey!

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:32.477
<i>The train departing for Seoul
will leave in five minutes.</i>

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:02.810
<i>The train departing for Seoul
will leave shortly.</i>

01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:06.776
<i>Please board the train promptly.</i>

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:19.660
Let's split up. Who'll go where?

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:25.631
Yeon and the foreigner will be in first
or second class. So I'll take her.

01:09:25.631 --> 01:09:28.830
So you'll arrest Yeon
and reap the glory yourself?

01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:29.831
What?

01:09:31.466 --> 01:09:34.004
Then you go that way,
I'll head to the back.

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:36.376
But are they really here?

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:25.714
What are you doing here?

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:27.092
You've been exposed.

01:11:27.416 --> 01:11:28.622
Where's Yeon?

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:30.722
Is she with the foreigner?

01:11:31.587 --> 01:11:33.567
Yes, with Ludvik in first class.

01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:35.492
Hashimoto went that way.

01:11:35.758 --> 01:11:37.897
But only our members
know about this train.

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:41.301
One of your people on this train is a rat.

01:11:41.898 --> 01:11:43.639
The same one who sold Jang-Ok.

01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:47.441
I'm in danger now, too,
because of you.

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:49.149
No time to talk,

01:11:49.438 --> 01:11:52.282
I need to find Hashimoto
and impede him somehow.

01:11:52.842 --> 01:11:55.345
In the meantime, think of a plan.

01:14:20.256 --> 01:14:23.669
<i>One of your people on this train is a rat.</i>

01:14:38.174 --> 01:14:39.517
Hold my bag for a second.

01:15:05.368 --> 01:15:06.346
No one in the back?

01:15:06.347 --> 01:15:08.042
No, I don't think so.

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:09.543
All right.

01:15:15.878 --> 01:15:16.878
Hashimoto!

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:20.054
Just a minute.

01:15:25.154 --> 01:15:26.154
Sit down here.

01:15:32.828 --> 01:15:36.469
If we stomp around like this,
they'll see us and change plans.

01:15:36.732 --> 01:15:39.178
And we have to keep them
subdued until Seoul.

01:15:39.179 --> 01:15:42.843
If we don't get them all,
the others might attack.

01:15:43.139 --> 01:15:48.143
So if you see Kim Woo-Jin
or another suspect,

01:15:48.144 --> 01:15:51.751
just keep an eye on them,
then grab them at the station.

01:15:54.316 --> 01:15:56.489
Well, you've got a point.

01:15:57.420 --> 01:15:58.558
Then let's do this.

01:15:58.854 --> 01:16:03.496
We won't be too obvious. We'll search
while moving around like passengers.

01:16:04.326 --> 01:16:09.097
So you mean,
you'll still search the passengers?

01:16:09.098 --> 01:16:10.099
Yes, of course.

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:12.507
- What I meant is...
- But we'll do it quietly.

01:16:12.508 --> 01:16:15.572
If we don't round them up at once,
there could be trouble.

01:16:15.573 --> 01:16:18.609
Anyway, I'll look around.
You guys follow one car behind me.

01:17:58.607 --> 01:18:01.144
Sorry, I was just passing by.

01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:04.217
Y-You changed my baby's diaper?

01:18:04.218 --> 01:18:06.557
The smell is quite something. Bye, then.

01:18:08.951 --> 01:18:10.391
Just pretend you don't know me.

01:18:10.392 --> 01:18:11.660
The dining car, in 15 minutes.

01:18:16.458 --> 01:18:17.458
Hwe-Ryung...

01:18:19.461 --> 01:18:22.465
We need to change
our rendezvous in Seoul.

01:18:22.898 --> 01:18:24.571
I think the location's been leaked.

01:18:25.067 --> 01:18:27.513
Really? Where, then?

01:18:27.736 --> 01:18:29.738
Mokin Inn at Golden Pavilion,
four o'clock.

01:18:30.172 --> 01:18:33.346
Mokin Inn at Golden Pavilion,
four o'clock.

01:18:33.842 --> 01:18:37.813
I'll meet everyone one by one,
so don't talk needlessly.

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:57.741
We need to change
our rendezvous point.

01:18:58.867 --> 01:19:02.280
The new place is Mokin Inn
at Golden Pavilion.

01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:04.414
Mokin Inn at Golden Pavilion.

01:19:05.341 --> 01:19:06.341
Six o'clock.

01:19:07.343 --> 01:19:09.289
Mokin Inn at Golden Pavilion.

01:19:09.612 --> 01:19:10.716
Six o'clock.

01:19:13.549 --> 01:19:15.119
The location has changed.

01:19:15.684 --> 01:19:18.358
Taehwa-banjeom, four o'clock.

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:21.796
Taehwa-banjeom, four o'clock.

01:19:22.057 --> 01:19:25.937
Park Young-Mok's store, five o'clock.

01:19:26.462 --> 01:19:29.136
Don't tell anyone about this.

01:19:30.366 --> 01:19:31.366
All right.

01:19:54.089 --> 01:19:57.298
Hey! It's dangerous
to keep meeting like this!

01:19:58.227 --> 01:20:00.002
Listen closely.

01:20:00.596 --> 01:20:03.668
I told each of my members
a different rendezvous in Seoul.

01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:08.303
I gave them each
a different location and time.

01:20:09.605 --> 01:20:14.645
One of them will inform Hashimoto
before we arrive.

01:20:14.943 --> 01:20:17.787
That's the rat.
The one who betrayed Jang-Ok.

01:20:17.788 --> 01:20:19.847
But we can't keep meeting!

01:20:19.848 --> 01:20:23.261
Just tell me which time
and place they say.

01:20:23.686 --> 01:20:26.462
Why do I have to help you?

01:20:27.256 --> 01:20:30.260
Because if our plan is exposed,
you're in danger, too!

01:20:30.526 --> 01:20:33.132
In the end, you're the one
who lied to them!

01:20:33.762 --> 01:20:35.537
That's how we boarded this train!

01:20:37.366 --> 01:20:40.313
My job is to pretend
to be on your side!

01:20:40.469 --> 01:20:43.313
I'm the spy! Higashi approved it!

01:20:43.605 --> 01:20:46.484
But then you did something huge
without Higashi's knowledge.

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:50.050
Every time I run into you,
you blackmail me.

01:20:50.051 --> 01:20:52.821
This situation leaves me no choice!
What should I do?

01:20:53.015 --> 01:20:54.775
Should I set off the bombs
and kill everyone?

01:20:56.552 --> 01:20:57.552
Brother...

01:20:58.287 --> 01:21:01.131
help us arrive safely, okay?

01:21:03.892 --> 01:21:06.736
I'll wait in the dining car. Now move!

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.073
What an asshole!

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.344
How did it go?

01:21:21.477 --> 01:21:25.012
He must be disguised,
I can't find him.

01:21:25.013 --> 01:21:26.487
I guess I'll keep looking.

01:21:26.488 --> 01:21:28.483
How about you?
Did you find your informant?

01:21:28.484 --> 01:21:31.055
- Not yet.
- I met the informant.

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:35.034
There's a new order.

01:21:39.161 --> 01:21:40.936
For now, this is our plan.

01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:47.237
Our informant will point out
Kim Woo-Jin, Yeon and the others.

01:21:48.203 --> 01:21:52.379
We'll arrive at the station
without alerting them to our presence.

01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:58.256
Then our policemen will seal off
the station and arrest them all.

01:21:58.447 --> 01:22:00.948
So we won't touch them before Seoul?

01:22:00.949 --> 01:22:01.949
That's right.

01:22:02.217 --> 01:22:06.587
As you said, they outnumber us,
so it's risky to confront them.

01:22:06.588 --> 01:22:09.262
I think we can ride quietly
all the way to Seoul.

01:22:10.025 --> 01:22:13.063
Now we can sweep up the Resistance!

01:22:13.362 --> 01:22:16.400
And get Che-San soon, too!
This is exciting!

01:22:26.875 --> 01:22:29.412
I think I need a cold beer.

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.118
Oh, will you come, too?

01:22:33.382 --> 01:22:36.295
No, I don't drink. You go ahead.

01:22:37.386 --> 01:22:41.664
We've been running around all day.
Take a rest, I'll be back soon.

01:23:40.048 --> 01:23:41.649
What would you like?

01:23:41.650 --> 01:23:43.721
- A beer.
- Yes, sir.

01:23:44.186 --> 01:23:45.324
I'll bring a napkin.

01:23:45.621 --> 01:23:46.621
Thanks.

01:23:58.567 --> 01:23:59.568
I'm sorry.

01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:05.039
Hey!

01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:07.479
What's with you?

01:24:08.644 --> 01:24:09.679
Don't worry about it.

01:24:10.145 --> 01:24:11.145
Hey!

01:24:12.247 --> 01:24:14.193
It's okay. Don't worry. Let's sit.

01:24:16.251 --> 01:24:17.662
Are you sure?

01:24:43.278 --> 01:24:44.279
Hey...

01:24:45.414 --> 01:24:47.951
I thought something happened to you.

01:24:48.951 --> 01:24:51.124
I went out for some air.

01:24:51.553 --> 01:24:52.554
Did you hear?

01:24:53.055 --> 01:24:54.055
Yes.

01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:56.736
Where and what time?

01:24:58.961 --> 01:25:04.240
Mokin Inn at Golden Pavilion.

01:25:07.636 --> 01:25:09.445
<i>Mokin Inn at Golden Pavilion.</i>

01:25:10.072 --> 01:25:11.072
Four o'clock.

01:25:14.543 --> 01:25:15.647
<i>Four o'clock.</i>

01:25:20.248 --> 01:25:24.390
Don't be reckless.
Make trouble, and we all die!

01:25:24.886 --> 01:25:27.264
You work things out yourselves.
Don't ever contact me...

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:33.835
Hey, Woo-Jin...

01:25:34.830 --> 01:25:36.571
I think we've reached the end.

01:25:46.575 --> 01:25:48.282
Didn't you say you'd stay?

01:25:49.745 --> 01:25:52.316
Well, after thinking it over,

01:25:54.650 --> 01:25:57.351
I thought I'd share a beer
with you after all.

01:25:57.352 --> 01:25:58.352
One beer.

01:25:58.587 --> 01:25:59.587
Yes, sir.

01:26:57.145 --> 01:26:59.056
That tea smells nice.

01:27:05.554 --> 01:27:08.160
Have you got anything to say to me?

01:27:12.661 --> 01:27:17.041
He looks awfully similar to the guy
we're looking for, right?

01:27:25.707 --> 01:27:26.845
What are you talking about?

01:27:26.846 --> 01:27:31.018
I'll take command now. Think straight!

01:27:32.547 --> 01:27:35.790
I will command and you will follow.

01:27:42.758 --> 01:27:44.601
Police. Show me identification.

01:27:52.067 --> 01:27:53.375
Wait, don't move!

01:27:54.302 --> 01:27:55.372
Hey!

01:28:08.583 --> 01:28:10.961
My ID is in the bag, take it if you wish.

01:28:12.621 --> 01:28:16.091
Both of you listen.
One slip and we all die.

01:28:17.092 --> 01:28:22.667
That depends on who subdues
the other first. Think it over.

01:28:32.841 --> 01:28:33.945
Kim Woo-Jin.

01:28:51.827 --> 01:28:52.827
Now!

01:29:39.474 --> 01:29:42.318
You damned traitor!

01:29:55.991 --> 01:29:57.024
Out of the way!

01:29:57.025 --> 01:29:58.265
Move! Out of the way!

01:30:02.197 --> 01:30:06.737
Damn fool had a death wish.

01:30:07.102 --> 01:30:08.445
Step aside, it's dangerous!

01:30:13.575 --> 01:30:15.577
I'm a Captain of the
Japanese Police Bureau.

01:30:16.077 --> 01:30:19.524
I'm performing my duties,
so return to your places quietly.

01:30:19.781 --> 01:30:20.781
Yes, sir!

01:30:39.067 --> 01:30:40.205
A change of heart?

01:30:48.743 --> 01:30:50.916
More like a hardened heart.

01:30:52.113 --> 01:30:54.150
I lost my faith in this a while back.

01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:57.418
My heart's no longer in it.

01:30:57.419 --> 01:31:01.265
You talk like we're a store
going bankrupt.

01:31:01.756 --> 01:31:04.464
If we had just one success,
I wouldn't be this way.

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:08.266
Getting country hicks
to throw bombs for independence...

01:31:11.066 --> 01:31:12.841
I can't play dumb anymore.

01:31:15.437 --> 01:31:17.075
No use in going to Seoul.

01:31:17.772 --> 01:31:20.480
It's hopeless.
Even if I do you this favor.

01:31:20.481 --> 01:31:23.979
Favor? Who? To whom? You to me? To us?

01:31:27.015 --> 01:31:28.517
If not for me...

01:31:30.118 --> 01:31:31.995
you'd all have been exposed.

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:33.999
But you're my friend.

01:31:34.622 --> 01:31:36.465
You're all like family!

01:31:37.859 --> 01:31:39.497
Shouldn't you be grateful?

01:31:44.165 --> 01:31:45.974
This is vengeance for Jang-Ok.

01:32:05.887 --> 01:32:10.063
You're not really going to let
this foreigner kill me, are you?

01:32:11.626 --> 01:32:15.506
In the name of the Resistance,
you are executed for spying.

01:32:22.303 --> 01:32:23.304
Woo-Jin!

01:32:24.539 --> 01:32:25.984
See you in hell.

01:32:37.719 --> 01:32:40.359
Once we arrive, I don't know you.

01:32:44.259 --> 01:32:45.259
Take this with you.

01:32:51.032 --> 01:32:53.774
If we meet again, one of us dies.

01:32:54.936 --> 01:32:56.244
Or both of us.

01:34:19.954 --> 01:34:25.802
GYEONGSEONG STATION, SEOUL

01:34:28.496 --> 01:34:30.498
SEOUL STATION

01:35:31.326 --> 01:35:32.326
Go.

01:35:34.195 --> 01:35:35.196
Show me the pass.

01:35:40.068 --> 01:35:41.068
Next.

01:35:43.071 --> 01:35:44.106
Passport.

01:35:46.507 --> 01:35:47.507
Next.

01:35:55.116 --> 01:35:56.186
The pass.

01:36:16.404 --> 01:36:17.404
Ludvik.

01:36:20.775 --> 01:36:21.810
Everyone come!

01:36:24.979 --> 01:36:25.979
Go!

01:36:31.886 --> 01:36:32.886
Yeon Gye-Soon!

01:36:50.405 --> 01:36:51.405
Run!

01:36:58.446 --> 01:36:59.446
There!

01:37:35.550 --> 01:37:36.550
Hey!

01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:26.936
Calm down!

01:38:27.702 --> 01:38:28.935
Calm down, calm down!

01:38:28.936 --> 01:38:29.846
Let go!!

01:38:29.847 --> 01:38:30.941
Captain Kim Woo-Jin!

01:39:33.601 --> 01:39:34.671
My apologies.

01:39:36.337 --> 01:39:37.577
How do you feel?

01:39:39.607 --> 01:39:41.177
I'll recover quickly.

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:50.028
After being shot and falling off
a train, your condition is...

01:39:50.451 --> 01:39:52.362
a relief.

01:39:57.024 --> 01:39:59.800
The loss of Hashimoto is lamentable...

01:40:03.297 --> 01:40:07.439
but you deserve much credit.

01:40:22.016 --> 01:40:26.192
We recovered prime bait
for catching the big fish.

01:40:33.127 --> 01:40:34.538
Can you guess who?

01:40:52.246 --> 01:40:56.422
You're multilingual, but surely
most comfortable in Korean.

01:40:57.985 --> 01:41:01.831
Now we have someone to ask you in Korean.

01:41:03.758 --> 01:41:06.739
Ask Kim Woo-Jin's whereabouts.

01:41:11.365 --> 01:41:12.571
Where is Kim Woo-Jin?

01:41:15.736 --> 01:41:16.736
Wait.

01:41:21.275 --> 01:41:22.845
That won't do.

01:41:50.571 --> 01:41:51.879
Kim Woo-Jin...

01:41:52.907 --> 01:41:54.944
Just tell us where he is.

01:41:56.744 --> 01:41:57.984
I don't know.

01:41:58.746 --> 01:42:01.886
I don't know anything.

01:42:17.665 --> 01:42:19.008
Captain Lee!

01:42:27.008 --> 01:42:28.008
Chief...

01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:30.614
Do it.

01:42:32.813 --> 01:42:33.813
Do it!

01:42:45.092 --> 01:42:47.038
You just need to tell us!

01:42:47.361 --> 01:42:48.795
Come on and tell us!

01:42:48.796 --> 01:42:49.499
I don't know!

01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:50.498
- Tell us!
- I don't!

01:42:50.499 --> 01:42:53.633
- Tell us!
- I really don't know! No!

01:42:53.634 --> 01:42:56.012
- I said tell us!
- Don't do it!

01:42:56.303 --> 01:42:58.112
Please tell us! Please!

01:43:26.233 --> 01:43:32.047
KOREA BRANCH MILITARY POLICE HEADQUARTERS

01:43:34.508 --> 01:43:36.510
You look upset.

01:43:38.179 --> 01:43:40.159
No, sir.

01:43:41.182 --> 01:43:44.391
I heard you two were close in Shanghai.

01:43:46.153 --> 01:43:48.724
Do you suspect me?

01:44:00.601 --> 01:44:05.414
Other people suspected you
from the start, but not me.

01:44:07.108 --> 01:44:12.683
And due to the nature of your work,
during an operation...

01:44:13.748 --> 01:44:17.252
I don't ask too many questions.

01:44:20.121 --> 01:44:23.034
Governor-General Terauchi
said at his inauguration,

01:44:24.058 --> 01:44:31.806
"Koreans can choose to obey
Japanese rule, or die."

01:44:33.467 --> 01:44:36.573
It's your lot in life to be born Korean.

01:44:38.606 --> 01:44:40.244
So whatever you may have done,

01:44:42.376 --> 01:44:43.912
I'll forget everything.

01:44:47.214 --> 01:44:49.421
Just bring me Kim Woo-Jin.

01:45:23.617 --> 01:45:24.617
Let's just go.

01:45:40.835 --> 01:45:42.109
Seo Jin-Dol!

01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:47.678
Seo Jin-Dol!

01:45:48.142 --> 01:45:51.851
Oh, my, when will this weather let up?

01:45:59.854 --> 01:46:00.958
Drag him in.

01:46:03.023 --> 01:46:04.468
You're deported!

01:46:11.465 --> 01:46:13.843
It's the police! Run, quick!

01:46:27.314 --> 01:46:30.727
Mother, I need to go far away.
You must live!

01:46:45.099 --> 01:46:47.010
Mother, you must live!

01:46:47.935 --> 01:46:49.005
Let go!!

01:46:49.703 --> 01:46:50.703
Mother!

01:47:32.246 --> 01:47:33.919
Aren't you going home?

01:48:50.724 --> 01:48:51.998
Hey, Joo!

01:49:04.705 --> 01:49:07.413
Woo-Jin visited Jeongneung House.

01:49:08.909 --> 01:49:11.981
He said to ask you to make him an ID.

01:49:13.547 --> 01:49:14.890
He said you'd help him.

01:49:58.058 --> 01:49:59.058
Kim Woo-Jin!

01:50:04.364 --> 01:50:05.741
What happened to everyone?

01:50:10.404 --> 01:50:12.384
It'll be hard for Yeon to hold out.

01:50:14.374 --> 01:50:16.149
It serves you right.

01:50:16.577 --> 01:50:18.386
For being so cocky.

01:50:20.247 --> 01:50:21.419
You must leave.

01:50:22.282 --> 01:50:26.321
A coal ship for Japan...
If you leave now, you can catch it.

01:50:28.989 --> 01:50:30.229
How is my brother?

01:50:31.458 --> 01:50:32.664
I haven't seen him.

01:50:34.828 --> 01:50:36.102
Then why are you here?

01:50:36.763 --> 01:50:37.798
Because of Joo.

01:50:39.133 --> 01:50:40.133
Joo?

01:50:40.767 --> 01:50:43.145
You told him to find me for an ID.

01:51:17.704 --> 01:51:19.183
That way! Hurry! Hurry!

01:51:27.981 --> 01:51:29.016
Take him alive!

01:51:32.686 --> 01:51:34.029
Shoot his leg!

01:51:48.635 --> 01:51:49.635
Kim Woo-Jin!

01:51:55.042 --> 01:51:56.544
Lee Jung-Chool got away.

01:51:56.843 --> 01:51:57.878
What?

01:52:04.384 --> 01:52:05.658
Kim Woo-Jin...

01:52:07.154 --> 01:52:10.033
Surely you didn't trust Lee Jung-Chool.

01:52:12.059 --> 01:52:14.505
He's the one who turned you in.

01:52:17.764 --> 01:52:19.266
Where are the explosives?

01:52:20.367 --> 01:52:22.745
Right under your nose.

01:52:24.771 --> 01:52:26.876
I guess we've been too gentle.

01:52:27.774 --> 01:52:30.721
You still have some spirit.

01:52:31.845 --> 01:52:35.019
However long it takes,
you'll tell us eventually.

01:52:36.750 --> 01:52:38.752
That's not going to happen.

01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:41.693
Ever.

01:52:48.595 --> 01:52:52.805
Was Yeon your lover?

01:53:05.912 --> 01:53:08.153
Want to hear a funny story?

01:53:10.050 --> 01:53:14.658
You all think you were caught
because of your rat?

01:53:15.422 --> 01:53:20.895
We didn't know Yeon's face, but
we caught her because of her photograph.

01:53:23.597 --> 01:53:25.338
The one you took at your studio.

01:53:35.575 --> 01:53:39.182
Let's see how much you can take.

01:53:41.415 --> 01:53:42.860
You dreadful man.

01:53:43.784 --> 01:53:44.784
Begin.

01:54:06.673 --> 01:54:08.016
He bit his tongue!

01:54:10.711 --> 01:54:12.782
You still haven't found the explosives?

01:54:14.781 --> 01:54:17.022
Chief! We caught Lee Jung-Chool.

01:55:28.388 --> 01:55:29.423
All rise!

01:55:41.768 --> 01:55:42.768
Please be seated.

01:55:46.773 --> 01:55:48.480
The court is now in session.

01:55:55.615 --> 01:55:57.891
We will hear the defendant's statement.

01:56:03.290 --> 01:56:05.133
Lee Jung-Chool.

01:56:06.226 --> 01:56:07.296
Lee Jung-Chool!

01:56:08.562 --> 01:56:09.563
Come forward.

01:56:31.685 --> 01:56:32.789
Please begin.

01:56:34.754 --> 01:56:39.362
I planned to accept the explosives
from Kim Woo-Jin and confiscate them,

01:56:39.363 --> 01:56:41.669
so I didn't report in advance.

01:56:43.196 --> 01:56:45.870
I waited for the remaining
Resistance members

01:56:46.666 --> 01:56:49.476
and intended to arrest them all at once.

01:57:05.185 --> 01:57:09.793
As a police official,
I tried to fulfill my mission.

01:57:11.725 --> 01:57:17.334
And believing that success
could get me a promotion,

01:57:19.666 --> 01:57:22.806
I infiltrated the enemy.

01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:28.212
I...

01:57:41.755 --> 01:57:46.704
As a Japanese policeman...

01:57:48.995 --> 01:57:51.339
I merely tried my best.

01:57:54.534 --> 01:57:59.040
I'm not a member of the Resistance.

01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:03.218
I only intended to use Kim Woo-Jin.

01:58:07.747 --> 01:58:11.854
I'm not his comrade nor his friend!

01:58:26.733 --> 01:58:29.475
This is so unfair!

01:58:51.324 --> 01:58:53.065
The dog of Japan is here!

01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:56.663
I'll be watching you!

01:58:56.997 --> 01:58:58.908
Because of you, I'm here forever!

01:58:58.909 --> 01:59:00.065
Filthy traitor!

01:59:00.066 --> 01:59:02.801
I'm going to beat you to a pulp!

01:59:02.802 --> 01:59:04.782
Hey, Lee Jung-Chool!

01:59:05.405 --> 01:59:09.285
ONE MONTH LATER

01:59:26.826 --> 01:59:28.328
Hey, silent guy...

01:59:30.997 --> 01:59:35.173
Yeon died this morning.

02:00:35.228 --> 02:00:37.333
Why is it so small?

02:00:39.899 --> 02:00:41.708
She starved herself to death.

02:00:43.703 --> 02:00:47.412
She came from China, and had
no friends or relatives.

02:00:51.111 --> 02:00:55.560
No good place to bury her,
but I can't throw her away.

02:01:18.772 --> 02:01:21.309
I'm in a hurry. Please step aside.

02:01:21.808 --> 02:01:22.809
Step aside.

02:02:15.295 --> 02:02:18.833
You haven't eaten a bite. No appetite?

02:02:30.143 --> 02:02:31.383
Are you going somewhere?

02:02:35.381 --> 02:02:36.792
Chief Higashi?

02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:39.621
<i>He has a banquet to attend,.</i>

02:02:39.886 --> 02:02:43.493
<i>A charity event at the Police Bureau Club,.</i>

02:02:44.624 --> 02:02:46.331
Who will come to the event?

02:02:46.793 --> 02:02:49.695
<i>High-ranking police bureaucrats,</i>

02:02:49.696 --> 02:02:53.667
<i>imperial Parliament members
and supporters of the regime.</i>

02:03:29.569 --> 02:03:30.569
Brother...

02:03:34.774 --> 02:03:36.048
Brother...

02:03:39.512 --> 02:03:40.957
You take the explosives.

02:03:42.081 --> 02:03:44.956
While I go out and distract them,
you hide them.

02:03:44.957 --> 02:03:46.222
You're crazy to the end.

02:03:46.223 --> 02:03:47.721
And promise one more thing.

02:03:49.088 --> 02:03:52.729
Even if you're caught, hold out
to the end. Say you're not part of us.

02:03:54.294 --> 02:03:55.898
Because one of us has to live.

02:03:56.195 --> 02:03:59.438
So the operation will succeed.
So our lives won't be wasted!

02:04:04.904 --> 02:04:05.905
Thanks for everything.

02:04:06.873 --> 02:04:08.784
I never could've made it without you.

02:04:59.993 --> 02:05:05.773
JAPAN AND KOREA UNITE
NIGHT OF NATIVE KOREANS

02:07:24.670 --> 02:07:26.911
Ladies and gentlemen,
Bureau Chief Higashi!

02:08:01.874 --> 02:08:02.874
Cheers!

02:08:03.142 --> 02:08:04.382
Cheers!

02:08:21.561 --> 02:08:22.562
Let's go.

02:09:03.269 --> 02:09:06.682
<i>Deceased</i>

02:10:01.327 --> 02:10:05.002
Officer! Officer! Are the rumors true?

02:10:05.298 --> 02:10:06.777
Quiet, you!

02:10:16.075 --> 02:10:17.076
Hey!

02:10:17.510 --> 02:10:19.421
Hey, silent guy!

02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:22.091
Did you hear?

02:10:25.851 --> 02:10:28.195
An explosion at the Police Bureau Club

02:10:28.854 --> 02:10:31.528
killed and injured many people.

02:10:33.292 --> 02:10:34.669
It's chaos.

02:10:35.328 --> 02:10:37.137
They've never seen such a hell.

02:10:38.497 --> 02:10:45.437
But they still haven't found half
of the Resistance's explosives.

02:10:48.774 --> 02:10:51.118
That's even scarier.

02:11:35.721 --> 02:11:39.168
Well, it's better than letting
the Japanese grab it.

02:11:41.026 --> 02:11:45.600
But promise. If people know my money
is going to the fighters, it's a problem.

02:11:45.898 --> 02:11:48.071
Keep it a secret until independence.

02:11:49.034 --> 02:11:51.412
You think independence will come, sir?

02:11:53.906 --> 02:11:55.943
With guys like you, I'm sure it will.

02:11:58.077 --> 02:11:59.077
Sir...

02:12:00.713 --> 02:12:02.454
and how much for this?

02:12:05.951 --> 02:12:11.128
There are more Government Medals
in this city than scoundrels.

02:12:15.795 --> 02:12:18.969
How much do I owe you?

02:12:19.598 --> 02:12:22.579
The amount you received
for betraying Kim Jang-Ok.

02:12:28.607 --> 02:12:30.109
Who said that?

02:12:30.409 --> 02:12:32.082
Jo Hwe-Ryung? Joo?

02:13:29.001 --> 02:13:30.674
Take this, too.

02:13:39.378 --> 02:13:40.823
I'll succeed for sure.

02:13:42.147 --> 02:13:43.888
Is Che-San well?

02:13:44.316 --> 02:13:46.353
Yes, he's fine.

02:13:47.353 --> 02:13:52.200
He cried bitterly during
the hearing about your operation.

02:13:53.492 --> 02:13:55.472
Then he said this...

02:13:56.228 --> 02:13:58.469
"Even when we fail, we move forward.

02:13:59.665 --> 02:14:05.513
The failures accrue, and we tread anthem
to advance to higher ground."

02:14:13.045 --> 02:14:16.720
Do you have any message to pass on to him?

02:14:25.691 --> 02:14:27.068
"See you again."

02:15:03.729 --> 02:15:07.199
<i>"Even when we fail, we move forward."</i>

02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:10.871
<i>The failures accrue, and we tread on them
to advance to higher ground."</i>

02:15:10.872 --> 02:15:15.443
JAPANESE HEADQUARTERS IN KOREA
<i>The failures accrue, and we tread on them to advance to higher ground."</i>

02:15:50.275 --> 02:16:01.975
<i>Resistance fighters pass through here.</i>
