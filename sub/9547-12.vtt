WEBVTT

00:05.012 --> 00:07.482
They got nerve.
Right in front of the sign.

00:08.034 --> 00:10.834
Looks like the city
just made an easy $85.

00:13.313 --> 00:14.423
What are you doing?

00:15.110 --> 00:16.655
This place got held up yesterday.

00:16.752 --> 00:18.584
I remember. I took the call.

00:19.035 --> 00:20.093
Looks pretty quiet.

00:21.090 --> 00:22.826
Damn pen's out of ink.

00:23.212 --> 00:24.215
Use mine.

00:24.459 --> 00:25.462
Forget it.

00:26.023 --> 00:27.431
Let's just grab some chili.

00:29.624 --> 00:30.627
Funny,

00:31.017 --> 00:33.232
whoever owns that car has no idea.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.316
Tonight was their lucky night.

<i>Help! Hey!</i>

01:16.688 --> 01:17.923
<i>Hey, somebody!</i>

01:17.943 --> 01:19.268
<i>Help! Help!</i>

01:19.288 --> 01:20.403

01:20.721 --> 01:22.711
<i>Hello!</i>

01:22.752 --> 01:24.614
<i>Hey! Hello!</i>

01:24.634 --> 01:25.854
It's no use.

01:30.814 --> 01:32.223
Nobody's coming.

01:34.036 --> 01:35.676
Nobody's coming.

01:37.788 --> 01:41.007
Season 6 - Episode 12

01:41.129 --> 01:44.344
- Mr Monk Goes to the Bank.

02:39.343 --> 02:41.932
- Permission to speak freely.
- Permission denied.

02:41.952 --> 02:44.397
I'm gonna say it anyway.
You have to buy a new toaster.

02:44.760 --> 02:45.885
I'm fine.

02:46.411 --> 02:48.630
- It's fine.
- It's burning all the toast. Look!

02:48.707 --> 02:50.048
Mr. Monk, it's a fire hazard.

02:50.125 --> 02:52.930
Natalie, I've had that toaster for
27 years.

02:53.111 --> 02:54.600
I'll just call a repairman.

02:54.620 --> 02:58.469
No, no, no, there's no such thing,
Mr. Monk. Nobody fixes toasters anymore.

02:58.489 --> 03:00.443
You can buy a new one for $30.

03:00.616 --> 03:01.627
$30?

03:03.930 --> 03:04.747
$30?

03:04.767 --> 03:07.226
Or you could see your house
burn down around you.

03:09.862 --> 03:11.540
Well, I am renting, so...

03:12.707 --> 03:14.347
Let's see what kind of year we have.

03:17.524 --> 03:19.701
<i>Sharon, I've just been talking
with police officials.</i>

03:19.721 --> 03:22.707
<i>According to a department
spokesperson, a Masked Gunman</i>

03:22.727 --> 03:24.146
<i>forced his way into this branch</i>

03:24.166 --> 03:26.046
<i>of the west bay trust
here on vinton street.</i>

03:26.066 --> 03:29.136
<i>Mr. Monk, isn't that your bank?
Just as they were opening for the day.</i>

03:29.527 --> 03:32.700
<i>That Gunman then shot one bank teller,
and forced the other employees</i>

03:32.720 --> 03:35.016
<i>to break open the safety deposit boxes.</i>

03:35.183 --> 03:36.712
Natalie, that's my bank!

03:36.732 --> 03:40.004
<i>As we get additional details, we'll
bring them to you live right here.</i>

03:42.809 --> 03:43.974
Hang in there, okay?

03:44.586 --> 03:45.975
Don't worry about a thing.

03:46.303 --> 03:47.750
Take good care of that girl.

03:49.717 --> 03:52.274
I'm sorry.
I thought this was a crime scene.

03:52.685 --> 03:53.920
Take it outside.

03:55.129 --> 03:57.589
- How's the teller doing?
- Stabilized through and through.

03:57.609 --> 03:58.774
She's a lucky girl.

04:01.425 --> 04:02.407
Hello!

04:03.214 --> 04:06.067
I'm Captain Leland Stottlemeyer.
How you folks doing?

04:06.275 --> 04:07.440
I could use a drink.

04:07.690 --> 04:08.836
I'm sure you could.

04:09.023 --> 04:11.514
- We'll try not to keep you too long.
- How's Jasmine?

04:11.614 --> 04:13.158
Jasmine. Is that the teller?

04:13.571 --> 04:14.821
She's gonna be fine.

04:15.056 --> 04:17.055
Whatever they're paying her,
it ain't enough.

04:17.166 --> 04:18.161
That's for sure.

04:19.120 --> 04:22.349
So I'm gonna have to get a statement
from each of you individually.

04:22.369 --> 04:23.246
Now?

04:23.577 --> 04:26.415
Why aren't you out there trying to find
that son of a bitch?

04:26.435 --> 04:28.129
<i>- She's right!
- The guy's crazy!</i>

04:28.149 --> 04:31.099
He shot her. How could he shoot her?
She was giving him all the money.

04:31.119 --> 04:33.212
Well, look, we're gonna do
the best that we can.

04:33.567 --> 04:34.943
But it starts with you,

04:35.129 --> 04:36.692
okay?
I'm gonna need your help.

04:37.725 --> 04:38.683
You the Manager?

04:39.288 --> 04:40.012
Yes.

04:40.032 --> 04:42.124
I'll start with you.
Can I use your office?

04:44.995 --> 04:45.824
So,

04:46.020 --> 04:47.042
where do I start?

04:47.062 --> 04:50.111
Well, the Gunman came in at 9:05.
Let's start at 9:04.

04:50.592 --> 04:52.849
I just unlocked the door.

04:53.136 --> 04:55.992
I was flipping the open sign
when this guy pushed right.

04:56.568 --> 04:57.630
Can you describe?

04:57.650 --> 04:59.137
A white guy. Large.

04:59.188 --> 05:00.580
He must have been six foot.

05:01.496 --> 05:04.615
- What was he wearing?
- A green hooded sweatshirt and a mask.

05:05.039 --> 05:07.567
He made me lock the door
and pull the shade.

05:07.737 --> 05:11.022
He had his gun pointed at Mr. Crawley
the whole time.

05:11.042 --> 05:13.401
<i>And he made us empty all the drawers.</i>

05:13.581 --> 05:15.067
<i>I'll never forget his voice.</i>

05:15.198 --> 05:18.501
<i>He had an accent.
Definitely russian. Very thick.</i>

05:18.559 --> 05:19.791
Just off the boat.

05:20.263 --> 05:22.563
He had a big bag. We were filling it.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.070
I saw Jasmine reach
for the silent alarm.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.006
He must have seen her.

05:27.295 --> 05:28.645
It all happened so fast.

05:28.771 --> 05:30.021
Then what did you do?

05:30.189 --> 05:32.322
He made us all lie down on the floor.

05:33.710 --> 05:34.867
Even Jasmine.

05:34.944 --> 05:36.616
She was still bleeding.

05:36.738 --> 05:37.756
And crying.

05:38.690 --> 05:42.038
<i>He had a drill and he was breaking
open the deposit boxes.</i>

05:42.160 --> 05:43.472
It seemed like forever.

05:43.538 --> 05:45.661
I thought I was gonna
give birth right there.

05:46.619 --> 05:50.343
<i>He told us not to move for five minutes,
and then he left out the back.</i>

05:50.653 --> 05:53.103
<i>But
we were too worried about jasmine.</i>

05:53.514 --> 05:56.143
As soon as he was gone,
mr. Crawley pulled the alarm.

05:56.241 --> 05:57.057
Okay,

05:57.745 --> 05:58.971
thank you very much.

06:00.292 --> 06:01.295
Is that it?

06:01.493 --> 06:02.207
Yep.

06:03.039 --> 06:04.810
Unless you can think of something else.

06:05.477 --> 06:07.139
If we think of anything, we'll call you.

06:08.719 --> 06:10.263
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?

06:10.476 --> 06:11.480
It's a boy.

06:12.414 --> 06:14.487
Good for you.
Got names picked out?

06:14.694 --> 06:16.295
We haven't decided yet.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.178
What's your name?

06:20.826 --> 06:21.849
Leland.

06:23.406 --> 06:24.853
We haven't decided yet.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.143
Okay, thank you very much.

06:30.866 --> 06:31.676
Okay.

06:32.595 --> 06:33.881
So you didn't see anything?

06:34.056 --> 06:36.429
I told you, I didn't even
get here until 10:30.

06:51.319 --> 06:53.152
Excuse me, Lieutenant Disher, SFPD.

06:53.544 --> 06:56.639
You got a pretty good view the bank
from here. We're investigating a Robbery

06:56.659 --> 06:58.416
that took place earlier this morning.

06:59.949 --> 07:00.778
Sir?

07:05.564 --> 07:08.265
Sir, this is official police business.
It'll just take a minute.

07:09.733 --> 07:10.929
If you're not too busy.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.287
All right, I know you can hear me.

07:18.007 --> 07:20.072
Look, I just saw you blink. You blinked.

07:30.475 --> 07:31.536
I get it.

07:34.841 --> 07:36.712
Normally we don't pay for information.

07:37.175 --> 07:39.548
So what time did you arrive
at the park this morning, sir?

07:41.276 --> 07:42.539
Okay, you know what, pal?

07:42.559 --> 07:45.857
I can get crane down here in 20 minutes,
lift you up and drag you downtown.

07:49.573 --> 07:52.134
- It's my break.
- Thank you. That's more like it.

07:53.234 --> 07:54.525
This is my job.

07:55.561 --> 07:58.466
I mean, how would you like it if I came
down to your office and got all

07:58.588 --> 07:59.600
in your face?

08:02.708 --> 08:03.712
Was I here?

08:03.953 --> 08:04.957
Yeah, I was here.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.459
I've been here all day.
I'm here every morning.

08:08.564 --> 08:09.626
Even sundays.

08:09.647 --> 08:12.965
Good, did you see
anything unusual around 9:00?

08:13.185 --> 08:16.819
Yeah, I saw a guy.
About 5'10", green hoodie.

08:17.129 --> 08:19.290
He was hanging out, pacing around.

08:19.562 --> 08:20.990
Looked kind of nervous.

08:21.409 --> 08:23.941
And then he went inside.
Good, did you get a look at his face?

08:23.961 --> 08:25.417
He had his hood up, sorry.

08:25.830 --> 08:28.412
Okay, hood up. And then what happened?

08:28.506 --> 08:31.747
About ten minutes later
the alarm went off and I saw...

08:36.114 --> 08:37.174
what are you doing?

08:39.222 --> 08:40.544
No, no, no, no.

08:40.563 --> 08:42.212
No, no, no, don't. Don't do that.

08:42.831 --> 08:44.222
Hey, we're not done here.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.820
What did you see?

08:53.028 --> 08:54.481
Captain, what are you doing here?

08:54.501 --> 08:58.014
The Robbery squad was shorthanded,
so Randy and I took the call.

08:58.448 --> 09:00.455
No dead bodies. It's nice.

09:01.145 --> 09:03.585
Sir, I'm sorry. The bank isn't open.

09:03.605 --> 09:06.938
I heard about the Robbery.
Is the Manager here, mr. Crawley?

09:06.958 --> 09:08.536
Mr. Crawley is busy right now.

09:08.658 --> 09:10.501
- If you come back tomorrow...
- Mr. Crawley!

09:11.035 --> 09:12.644
Peter. Yes, Mr. Monk.

09:12.818 --> 09:15.478
I heard about the Robbery.
It must have been terrible for you.

09:15.498 --> 09:18.700
It was terrible. Awful.
Did you hear about Jasmine Dadlani?

09:18.720 --> 09:20.032
He shot her in the arm.

09:20.052 --> 09:22.542
- I was...
- Is this gonna be a long story, Peter?

09:23.340 --> 09:25.019
No, I guess I'm done.

09:25.459 --> 09:28.189
Kind of worried
about my safe deposit box.

09:28.257 --> 09:30.668
Box number 100.
Number 1-00.

09:31.378 --> 09:33.230
We haven't done a full inventory yet.

09:34.766 --> 09:36.174
Why don't we take a look?

09:40.868 --> 09:41.678
No.

09:46.503 --> 09:47.989
Trudy's bracelet.

09:49.511 --> 09:51.837
Is was her grandmother's.
She wore it all the time.

09:51.857 --> 09:53.681
- Do you have insurance?
- No, I

09:53.760 --> 09:56.542
didn't need insurance.
I put it in the bank.

09:59.241 --> 10:01.151
Is god as my witness...

10:02.181 --> 10:03.474
I'm getting it back.

10:08.923 --> 10:09.926
What do you say.

10:09.987 --> 10:11.801
Randy, give it a rest.

10:11.878 --> 10:13.767
We must have put 80 bucks in that can.

10:13.787 --> 10:15.909
For three hours work, tax free?

10:16.174 --> 10:17.699
The guy makes more money than I do.

10:17.812 --> 10:19.819
Just doing nothing. Standing there.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.409
I can do that.

10:21.724 --> 10:22.765
Yes, you can.

10:23.031 --> 10:24.690
Well, I'm gonna do it.

10:24.805 --> 10:26.444
After work. Do it part time.

10:26.846 --> 10:28.216
Pick up a couple of bucks.

10:28.273 --> 10:29.913
You're gonna be a living statue?

10:30.399 --> 10:31.324
Yes, I am.

10:31.524 --> 10:32.565
Good for you.

10:32.652 --> 10:34.911
But how are we supposed to know
what job you're doing?

10:35.256 --> 10:36.452
I'll be painted silver.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.577
How hard can this be?

10:38.597 --> 10:41.112
Captain, Mr. Monk
wants to show you something.

10:41.132 --> 10:43.455
- And where is Mr. Monk?
- In your office.

10:43.605 --> 10:46.641
I hate it when he does that. I told him
not to go in there without me.

10:46.869 --> 10:48.392
I don't know why he gets so upset.

10:48.430 --> 10:50.475
It's not like he's gonna
mess up anything.

10:52.676 --> 10:53.571
Randy.

10:55.713 --> 10:56.774
What are you doing?

11:00.286 --> 11:02.871
Hello?
Are you all right?

11:05.588 --> 11:07.517
My gosh. Tickle tickle tickle.

11:10.147 --> 11:11.150
All right.

11:22.793 --> 11:25.906
I'm taking these two pencils
and I'm gonna stick 'em up your nose.

11:28.319 --> 11:29.341
That's number one.

11:31.679 --> 11:32.721
And number two.

11:35.608 --> 11:38.226
Our tax dollars at work.

11:40.924 --> 11:42.082
Lieutenant.

11:52.384 --> 11:53.387
Come in.

11:53.418 --> 11:55.141
Why don't you just
make yourself at home?

11:55.238 --> 11:57.936
- Natalie said you wouldn't mind.
- What the hell does...

11:58.923 --> 12:01.084
Doesn't matter, leland, take a breath.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.657
Yeah,
you know how to work this? It's stuck.

12:06.094 --> 12:07.213
Yes, I do.

12:09.843 --> 12:11.341
Yeah, good. Have you seen this?

12:11.580 --> 12:13.759
Only about 20 times. It's useless.

12:14.554 --> 12:16.218
Can't see anything a plant's in the way.

12:16.238 --> 12:17.543
Exactly! Leland,

12:17.581 --> 12:19.474
that's my bank! I know that lobby.

12:19.856 --> 12:23.481
That fichus tree has been sitting
in the corner for ten years.

12:23.554 --> 12:25.657
It's never been moved until today.

12:25.811 --> 12:27.914
This morning, before the gunmen came in.

12:27.997 --> 12:31.039
Somebody moved it in front
of the surveillance camera.

12:31.649 --> 12:32.752
Before the Robbery?

12:32.772 --> 12:36.405
Also, the Russian went out the back door
and the alarm didn't sound.

12:36.425 --> 12:37.926
So somebody disconnected it.

12:37.946 --> 12:39.352
Yeah, that one we caught.

12:39.838 --> 12:42.796
And there is a gate out back
at the end of the alley.

12:42.816 --> 12:45.208
It was unlocked. Somebody unlocked it.

12:45.453 --> 12:47.836
So the Russian's not alone.
He's got an inside man.

12:47.977 --> 12:50.428
If I can find the inside man,
he'll lead me to the Russian.

12:50.448 --> 12:53.079
And the Russian leads me
to Trudy's bracelet.

12:55.204 --> 12:56.437
Trudy's bracelet.

12:58.192 --> 12:59.389
I should have known.

12:59.577 --> 13:02.431
Well, I gotta get into that bank.
I gotta have a look around.

13:02.451 --> 13:04.879
Well, Monk, you just can't
go hang out at a bank.

13:04.899 --> 13:06.855
It's a place of business.
People don't like it

13:06.977 --> 13:08.780
if you just go and hang out
in their office.

13:10.761 --> 13:12.235
Maybe they need a security guard.

13:14.235 --> 13:16.115
You know, after today, I bet they do.

13:17.731 --> 13:19.784
Looks like you're gonna
get to wear a badge again.

13:24.729 --> 13:26.291
- Good morning.
- Morning.

13:31.720 --> 13:34.883
Gloria, would you call downtown
and check the rates on this?

13:40.163 --> 13:41.783
- Mr. Monk.
- Ma'am.

13:42.530 --> 13:43.619
How are you doing?

13:43.639 --> 13:44.709
Can't complain.

13:45.351 --> 13:47.698
I wanna thank you again
for helping us out.

13:47.747 --> 13:49.168
It's just for a day or two.

13:49.241 --> 13:50.757
Well, it means a lot to us.

13:51.133 --> 13:53.275
After what happened yesterday,

13:53.546 --> 13:55.554
I feel a lot safer with you here.

13:56.167 --> 13:57.167
You do.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.095
Of course I do.

13:59.724 --> 14:00.724
Who wouldn't?

14:03.060 --> 14:04.603
That's a good question.

14:06.407 --> 14:08.472
One of you doesn't want me here.

14:09.863 --> 14:11.194
But which one?

14:12.522 --> 14:15.358
Who is the inside man?

14:42.844 --> 14:44.857
Excuse me, could you use this pen?

14:45.135 --> 14:45.946
Why?

14:47.328 --> 14:48.533
That one's not working.

14:48.553 --> 14:51.128
What are you talking about?
It's working fine.

14:53.140 --> 14:55.724
Please, Please, Please.

14:57.036 --> 14:58.633
You're making me very nervous.

14:58.942 --> 15:00.287
Where did they find you?

15:00.666 --> 15:01.839
It's my first day.

15:03.112 --> 15:05.890
Where were you yesterday,
when they need you?

15:39.738 --> 15:41.965
That's a nice car, Peter.
Is that what you drive?

15:42.497 --> 15:43.595
I wish.

15:44.021 --> 15:45.603
I can barely afford the model.

15:53.784 --> 15:55.829
- I'm depositing this.
- No problem.

15:55.975 --> 15:58.117
$98. I'll just be a second.

15:59.644 --> 16:00.976
$98?

16:01.350 --> 16:02.489
That's right.

16:07.242 --> 16:08.409
What's this?

16:08.429 --> 16:09.786
Make it an even hundred.

16:11.384 --> 16:12.966
Well, that's what I call service.

16:14.696 --> 16:16.703
- Are you allowed to do that?
- Sure.

16:17.371 --> 16:18.383
He can.

16:20.964 --> 16:22.175
I'd like to cash this.

16:23.254 --> 16:25.723
$496.

16:37.403 --> 16:39.197
- 500.
- Thank you.

16:44.387 --> 16:45.564
Next in line!

16:47.405 --> 16:48.393
Next in line.

16:48.413 --> 16:49.744
I'm waiting for her.

16:50.899 --> 16:53.330
That's it.
I'm broke.

17:02.809 --> 17:04.098
Mr. Monk!

17:04.118 --> 17:06.144
- Hello.
- Look at you!

17:06.356 --> 17:09.719
A man in uniform.
You look great!

17:11.295 --> 17:13.397
- Look at you!
- Okay.

17:14.018 --> 17:16.646
Look... at... you!

17:16.665 --> 17:18.539
- Natalie, stop it.
- Look at you!

17:18.621 --> 17:19.875
Don't make me shoot you.

17:20.374 --> 17:21.530
How's it going?

17:22.828 --> 17:26.445
I'm down $400. Do you have any cash? I
didn't have a chance to get to the bank.

17:26.465 --> 17:28.858
No, did you find the accomplice?
The inside man?

17:58.093 --> 17:59.093
Maybe.

17:59.712 --> 18:00.754
Well, who is it?

18:01.058 --> 18:03.026
Wait, don't tell me.
Let me figure it out.

18:03.927 --> 18:05.085
Next in line!

18:05.585 --> 18:07.475
Her.
The pregnant woman.

18:07.591 --> 18:09.198
It's always the ones you least expect.

18:09.775 --> 18:11.029
Gloria morales.

18:11.199 --> 18:12.877
Good guess, but wrong.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.180
No, she's not strong enough.

18:15.378 --> 18:19.702
The inside man had to move this ficus
tree to block that security camera.

18:21.797 --> 18:22.934
What about Madge?

18:23.488 --> 18:26.517
Same problem. She couldn't move
the tree. She's got a bad back.

18:27.394 --> 18:29.227
What about him? He looks pretty strong.

18:29.317 --> 18:30.802
That's Leon Harrison.

18:31.169 --> 18:34.213
He could probably move the tree,
but he's too short.

18:34.233 --> 18:35.392
Too short? Yeah.

18:35.412 --> 18:39.526
The inside man had to trip the breaker
to disengage the alarm.

18:39.769 --> 18:41.216
He goes to the back door...

18:41.858 --> 18:45.206
The junction box is behind this cabinet,
which is bolted to the floor.

18:45.226 --> 18:46.471
I tried, but

18:47.465 --> 18:48.821
I just can't reach it.

18:49.450 --> 18:52.556
So the inside man
has to be taller than me.

18:55.259 --> 18:56.969
What about her? She's Pretty Tall.

18:56.989 --> 18:58.271
Tiffany Preston.

18:58.291 --> 19:00.888
It's her, isn't it?
God, kids today.

19:00.927 --> 19:03.477
- I blame the parents, really.
- No no, Natalie, it's not her.

19:03.497 --> 19:04.754
She is tall enough.

19:05.044 --> 19:08.430
But the inside man also had to unlock
the back gate.

19:08.669 --> 19:11.693
Tiffany just started working here,
so she doesn't have that key.

19:11.956 --> 19:13.836
But that's everybody.
There's no one left.

19:13.856 --> 19:15.154
Not quite.

19:15.193 --> 19:17.450
Mr. M. Anybody Miss me?

19:18.080 --> 19:19.354
I didn't think so.

19:20.436 --> 19:22.730
You remember Peter Crawley.
The branch Manager.

19:22.916 --> 19:25.636
Three and a half hours.
That is a long lunch break.

19:26.941 --> 19:27.860
Natalie.

19:28.262 --> 19:31.189
<i>You see that blue ticket?
That's from a parking garage.</i>

19:31.209 --> 19:34.588
<i>Why would he use a parking garage?
He has a private space right out front.</i>

19:40.452 --> 19:42.111
Oh, my god. The back of his neck.

19:42.710 --> 19:43.835
It's sunburned.

19:44.112 --> 19:44.863
So?

19:45.559 --> 19:47.423
He just bought a car.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.055
A convertible.

19:50.505 --> 19:52.761
A car he didn't want
anybody else to see.

19:53.100 --> 19:54.350
He's strong enough.

19:54.409 --> 19:55.700
He's tall enough.

19:55.851 --> 19:58.138
- He has a key to the gate.
- He's the guy!

19:58.338 --> 20:00.637
You're the guy.
Look at you!

20:00.709 --> 20:02.077
Mr. Monk!

20:02.345 --> 20:03.541
That's enough.

20:08.789 --> 20:11.239
Screwdrivers, gloves.

20:11.863 --> 20:13.329
Rough wrench.

20:14.210 --> 20:17.753
Extra scroll, saw blade, glass cover.
Here's the plan.

20:18.329 --> 20:19.815
When he leaves the house,

20:20.062 --> 20:22.999
we're gonna break in the back door.
Have a look around.

20:23.179 --> 20:24.553
Just hope he hasn't sold that

20:24.573 --> 20:26.615
bracelet.
I don't what I'd do if I lost it.

20:26.852 --> 20:29.032
- Mr. Monk, have you been working out?
- Ow, no.

20:32.005 --> 20:33.779
You think they'll let you
keep the uniform?

20:35.350 --> 20:36.618
I don't know.

20:36.638 --> 20:38.583
You should ask them.
It looks good on you.

20:38.659 --> 20:40.465
I used to make mitch
wear his all the time.

20:40.485 --> 20:43.504
- He'd walk out and he'd look so shiny.
- What are you talking about?

20:44.267 --> 20:45.438
Are you bantering?

20:45.872 --> 20:48.003
Am I. I don't know, I guess a little.

20:48.023 --> 20:49.269
I don't banter.

20:51.091 --> 20:53.657
We were right about the new car,
Jaguar.

20:54.064 --> 20:55.168
How can you tell?

20:55.313 --> 20:57.824
It's the Same Shape
as the toy on his desk.

20:58.216 --> 21:01.400
Well, I hope he has a good warranty
because it's leaking oil.

21:06.152 --> 21:07.231
That's not oil.

21:11.481 --> 21:12.503
Is it blood?

21:12.791 --> 21:13.601
Yeah.

21:23.669 --> 21:25.213
Don't look, don't look, don't look!

21:25.270 --> 21:27.855
- I have to look, i'm a detective.
- I'm talking to myself.

21:29.570 --> 21:30.870
Don't look, don't look.

21:36.610 --> 21:37.806
How's it going?

21:38.056 --> 21:41.205
Well, it's definitely the bank manager.
Shot twice in the head.

21:41.225 --> 21:43.820
- 22 caliber.
- A.22, just like the teller.

21:43.879 --> 21:45.979
Just like the teller,
only she's not dead.

21:46.592 --> 21:48.926
Looks like our russian friend
never learned how to share.

21:49.456 --> 21:51.906
Anybody ever tell you
you look really sharp in that uniform?

21:51.952 --> 21:54.444
Really, you think so?
I love a clip-on.

21:55.389 --> 21:57.866
So any sign of the Jewelry or the cash?

21:57.988 --> 21:59.529
No, nothing yet.

22:00.867 --> 22:03.814
Monk, I know how much
that bracelet means to you.

22:03.834 --> 22:06.639
I got two shifts of guys in there.
We're ripping the house apart.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.511
We'll be here all night
if we have to be.

22:08.608 --> 22:09.795
I appreciate that.

22:10.537 --> 22:13.071
Well, I guess we'll be going then.

22:13.472 --> 22:14.511
You're leaving?

22:14.531 --> 22:17.427
It looks like you've got it covered.
You don't really need me.

22:18.603 --> 22:19.722
Since when?

22:20.837 --> 22:24.530
I don't know, it's been a long day.
I guess I'm just tired.

22:25.078 --> 22:27.249
Call me if you
find anything.

22:27.948 --> 22:28.795
Okay.

22:31.004 --> 22:32.296
Wait up, wait up, wait.

22:32.417 --> 22:34.564
- Okay, what is going on?
- What do you mean?

22:34.647 --> 22:37.086
You know what I mean.
What are we doing?

22:37.106 --> 22:38.709
Trudy's bracelet could be in there.

22:42.393 --> 22:43.674
It's a pawn ticket.

22:43.983 --> 22:45.424
I found it in crawley's pocket.

22:45.444 --> 22:48.894
He pawned something yesterday
three hours after the Robbery. See?

22:48.956 --> 22:51.468
- You didn't tell the Captain?
- I will, I promise.

22:51.488 --> 22:53.465
- But after we check it out.
- No, no, no, no.

22:53.485 --> 22:54.480
Natalie.

22:55.963 --> 22:57.594
If they find that bracelet first,

22:57.614 --> 23:00.802
it'll get locked away in some evidence
room for about ten years.

23:03.338 --> 23:04.683
Okay, go. Go.

23:15.123 --> 23:16.123
Thank you.

23:17.329 --> 23:18.467
Here we go!

23:19.412 --> 23:20.628
How long was that?

23:21.629 --> 23:22.960
How long was what?

23:24.608 --> 23:25.950
I thought you were timing me.

23:26.184 --> 23:27.718
I was practicing. Didn't you notice?

23:27.738 --> 23:28.749
Nope, sorry.

23:30.455 --> 23:32.272
Hey look, why don't you do it again?

23:32.292 --> 23:33.594
This time I'll clock you.

23:34.422 --> 23:35.767
Go for it. Really go for it.

23:35.787 --> 23:37.562
See if you can't break
the world's record.

23:37.949 --> 23:39.496
- You think I can?
- Absolutely.

23:39.769 --> 23:40.626
Okay.

23:41.285 --> 23:42.403
- Hold on.
- Okay.

23:43.323 --> 23:44.326
You ready?

23:44.887 --> 23:45.966
And go.

24:06.976 --> 24:08.520
I heard you the first time.

24:09.007 --> 24:10.512
I only rang it once.

24:10.590 --> 24:13.184
Doesn't matter, I was just closing up.
Come back tomorrow.

24:13.238 --> 24:15.954
Tomorrow's too late.
Please? It's very important.

24:15.974 --> 24:18.215
Rent-a-cop?
I'm not afraid of you.

24:18.341 --> 24:19.604
No, I'm not.

24:19.835 --> 24:22.125
We're just here,
look...

24:23.511 --> 24:24.880
We wanna redeem this.

24:29.156 --> 24:30.487
You're not the same guy.

24:30.526 --> 24:32.743
No, sir, the same guy is dead.

24:32.763 --> 24:33.885
- Dead?
- Deceased.

24:33.905 --> 24:35.999
- Deceased?
- He was a bank Robber.

24:36.149 --> 24:37.393
Or at least an accomplice.

24:37.413 --> 24:40.048
Yeah, the merchandise he sold you
was probably stolen.

24:40.068 --> 24:41.992
He said this stuff
belonged to his grandmother.

24:42.012 --> 24:45.257
- And you believed him?
- I believe everybody. Store policy.

24:45.893 --> 24:46.914
Stay here.

24:52.136 --> 24:53.577
Mr. Monk, look, look, look!

24:53.615 --> 24:56.259
A toaster!
It's in perfect condition!

24:56.587 --> 24:57.736
No. No, thank you.

24:57.756 --> 25:00.473
Look, it's five dollars.
Please, I'll pay for it.

25:00.517 --> 25:03.809
Natalie, it's used. I'm not gonna make
food in somebody else's toaster.

25:03.859 --> 25:06.368
Unless I'm wrong, that's how
the bubonic plague got started.

25:06.388 --> 25:08.599
- That's not true.
- I said, unless I'm wrong.

25:12.749 --> 25:13.559
No.

25:14.119 --> 25:15.546
No, it's not here.

25:16.489 --> 25:17.866
Is this all he had?

25:17.929 --> 25:18.777
Look...

25:20.888 --> 25:22.393
We're looking for a bracelet.

25:24.523 --> 25:25.526
You see?

25:28.740 --> 25:30.016
Nice piece.

25:31.072 --> 25:32.615
I like the bracelet too.

25:33.527 --> 25:34.527
Sorry.

25:34.775 --> 25:36.888
He did say there was more
where this came from.

25:37.165 --> 25:40.630
Said he still had half a box
full of stuff back in San Francisco.

25:40.787 --> 25:42.041
Half a box?

25:42.394 --> 25:45.024
- That's an unusual phrase.
- That's what the man said.

25:45.694 --> 25:46.694
A box.

25:47.167 --> 25:48.595
Half a box.

25:57.221 --> 25:58.784
What are you doing here?

25:58.955 --> 26:01.395
You said meet us at the bank.
We're meeting you at the bank.

26:01.415 --> 26:03.974
Inside. I said inside the bank.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.355
They just closed at 7:00.

26:05.488 --> 26:06.357
No.

26:06.694 --> 26:09.005
No, no, no, no, no.
We gotta get in there.

26:12.244 --> 26:14.173
There's somebody...
There's somebody inside.

26:14.773 --> 26:16.525
It's Madge.
Madge!

26:16.619 --> 26:17.631
Madge.

26:18.456 --> 26:21.634
- Madge!
- Madge! Hey, it's me. Madge!

26:22.264 --> 26:23.256
Madge!

26:27.633 --> 26:29.471
I just heard about Peter Crawley.

26:29.754 --> 26:32.001
I couldn't believe it.
None of us could.

26:32.250 --> 26:34.591
I worked with him for seven years.

26:35.108 --> 26:37.146
I guess you never know anybody.
Not really.

26:37.423 --> 26:38.396
Not really.

26:38.518 --> 26:41.691
Madge, I think Trudy's bracelet
is still here in the bank.

26:42.107 --> 26:44.314
- Still here.
- Yeah. Yes.

26:44.334 --> 26:48.398
Crawley told a Pawn Broker in Brisbane
that he still had a half a box

26:48.418 --> 26:51.709
- full of Jewelry somewhere in his...
- A pawn Broker in Brisbane?

26:52.141 --> 26:53.912
I guess my cell phone was off the hook?

26:54.461 --> 26:56.483
- Here's the thing.
- Yeah, we just weren't sure.

26:56.503 --> 26:58.528
We know how busy you are it's a big job.

26:58.548 --> 26:59.409
It's okay.

26:59.429 --> 27:02.096
Just a little lead. Natalie
didn't think we should bother you.

27:02.116 --> 27:04.734
It's okay.
We'll talk about it later.

27:06.786 --> 27:08.059
I don't understand.

27:08.242 --> 27:11.016
Half a boxful.
It's an unusual phrase.

27:11.096 --> 27:14.880
Then I rembered. There are six extra
large deposit boxes in that vault.

27:14.937 --> 27:17.735
But during the Robbery
the Russian only opened five.

27:17.812 --> 27:20.139
Well, he ran out of time.
He was in a hurry.

27:20.496 --> 27:22.201
But it wasn't the last one.

27:22.221 --> 27:23.810
The one he skipped was in the middle.

27:23.839 --> 27:26.202
- Box 503.
- The money never left the bank.

27:26.222 --> 27:29.447
It's brilliant when you think about it.
It's the last place anybody would look.

27:29.569 --> 27:31.040
Come on, box 503.

27:31.259 --> 27:33.738
503. 5...5-0...

27:33.758 --> 27:36.279
Hold on, here it is. 503.

27:37.546 --> 27:39.263
<i>J. A. Guar.</i>

27:39.447 --> 27:41.425
Jaguar. Very cute.

27:43.160 --> 27:45.775
So this is definitely the guy.
Good work.

27:46.441 --> 27:48.332
We'll come back tomorrow
with a court order.

27:48.528 --> 27:49.309
No.

27:49.329 --> 27:50.952
Why don't we just look right now?

27:51.252 --> 27:54.651
Come on, we're already here.
Crawley's dead. He's not gonna mind.

27:54.928 --> 27:55.930
I don't know.

27:55.950 --> 27:57.306
Please, just a look.

27:57.326 --> 27:58.754
Just to see if it's in there.

27:58.843 --> 27:59.811
Please.

28:00.730 --> 28:02.042
It'll just take a minute.

28:03.023 --> 28:04.000
Well,

28:04.817 --> 28:06.322
I'll go get the master key.

28:06.360 --> 28:07.654
You can wait in here.

28:07.674 --> 28:08.653
Thanks, Madge.

28:44.206 --> 28:45.653
So any sign of the Russian?

28:45.700 --> 28:46.530
Nope.

28:47.105 --> 28:48.809
No, we're checking the phone records,

28:49.503 --> 28:50.872
but it's still a dead end.

29:25.093 --> 29:26.154
What is it?

29:30.346 --> 29:31.986
Six toothpicks.

29:33.700 --> 29:34.952
Why six?

29:43.829 --> 29:46.376
Looks like someone got the short
end of the straw?

29:49.301 --> 29:50.555
Oh, my god.

29:51.483 --> 29:53.104
We gotta get out of here.

29:55.632 --> 29:56.428
No, hey!

30:02.182 --> 30:04.104
- Hey!
- Madge!

30:12.050 --> 30:13.362
It's pretty quiet.

30:14.027 --> 30:15.609
My pen's out of ink.

30:16.008 --> 30:17.242
Use mine.

30:17.403 --> 30:18.522
Forget it.

30:18.969 --> 30:20.377
Let's just grab some chili.

30:20.791 --> 30:21.928
It's funny.

30:22.259 --> 30:24.458
Whoever owns that car has no idea.

30:24.861 --> 30:26.439
Tonight was their lucky night.

30:45.507 --> 30:47.667
<i>Help! Hey!</i>

30:48.025 --> 30:49.935
<i>Hey, somebody!</i>

30:50.118 --> 30:52.048
<i>Hey, somebody!</i>

30:52.663 --> 30:53.877
It's no use.

30:54.090 --> 30:56.077
It's no use. They're not coming.

30:56.595 --> 30:57.927
They're not coming.

30:58.318 --> 31:01.618
- I'm gonna die right here.
- No, you are not.

31:01.800 --> 31:04.401
You're right.
You're right.

31:05.683 --> 31:07.284
You're right.

31:08.987 --> 31:10.801
I'm gonna die over there.

31:12.332 --> 31:13.777
I call this spot.

31:14.033 --> 31:15.738
You can die over there.

31:16.992 --> 31:18.090
That's it.

31:18.833 --> 31:21.524
Monk is no longer the morale Officer.

31:21.544 --> 31:23.058
Still no signal.

31:24.427 --> 31:26.189
Phone lines must go through here.

31:27.943 --> 31:29.754
Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk.

31:29.774 --> 31:32.038
Come on, you have to...

31:32.058 --> 31:33.964
Come on, you gotta
pull yourself together.

31:34.001 --> 31:35.986
Look at me.
Look at me.

31:36.194 --> 31:38.545
We just have to make it until 9:00 am.

31:38.565 --> 31:40.853
When the bank opens,
they'll open the vault.

31:40.873 --> 31:42.554
No, they won't.

31:42.574 --> 31:44.194
Sure they will. Somebody will.

31:44.214 --> 31:45.732
You don't get it.

31:45.752 --> 31:48.341
It wasn't just Peter Crawley.

31:48.361 --> 31:51.287
Yeah, well, obviously we know now
that Madge was in on it too.

31:51.307 --> 31:54.465
- And the Russian.
- No, no, you still don't get it.

31:55.155 --> 31:58.490
It was all of them.
They were all in on it. Look,

31:58.556 --> 32:00.136
six toothpicks!

32:00.857 --> 32:05.613
Madge, Crawley, Jasmine,
Harrison, Tiffany, Gloria.

32:05.633 --> 32:08.975
The whole staff!
They planned it together.

32:10.458 --> 32:11.654
Here's what happened.

32:18.514 --> 32:20.694
<i>It was like they were putting on a play.</i>

32:21.661 --> 32:24.169
<i>They must have rehearsed it for weeks.</i>

32:33.219 --> 32:36.078
<i>One of them had to play the Russian.
It was probably madge.</i>

32:36.098 --> 32:37.883
<i>She was about the right height.</i>

32:38.413 --> 32:40.631
<i>I didn't see her
on the surveillance tape.</i>

32:40.810 --> 32:42.682
<i>But what did the toothpicks mean?</i>

32:43.570 --> 32:47.351
<i>One of them had to get shot.
To make it look good.</i>

32:47.956 --> 32:49.557
<i>So they were drawing straws.</i>

32:52.901 --> 32:54.979
I don't get it.
Why did they kill the Manager?

32:56.041 --> 32:57.816
Well, they probably had an agreement

32:57.836 --> 33:01.398
not to spend any of the money,
but Crawley couldn't resist.

33:02.116 --> 33:03.177
Of course...

33:03.831 --> 33:05.336
We'll never know for sure.

33:07.351 --> 33:09.005
Because we're gonna die.

33:19.076 --> 33:21.912
You're doing great, Mr. Monk.
I'm proud of you.

33:22.746 --> 33:23.634
Julie,

33:24.409 --> 33:26.724
must be worried sick about you.

33:26.789 --> 33:29.396
She's at dance camp, thank god.

33:29.609 --> 33:30.951
How's she doing?

33:31.462 --> 33:32.832
She loves it.

33:32.983 --> 33:35.121
She wants to be a counselor next year.

33:45.006 --> 33:45.816
Bingo.

33:47.264 --> 33:50.448
You were right.
It never left the bank.

33:58.130 --> 33:59.835
Okay, this is what I'm looking for.

34:01.649 --> 34:03.405
I believe you've been looking for that.

34:14.063 --> 34:15.955
That's really beautiful mr. Monk.

34:19.092 --> 34:21.138
Hey, at least we'll die rich.

34:26.442 --> 34:28.072
I don't understand.

34:28.292 --> 34:31.475
How does a big vault like that
get broken?

34:31.616 --> 34:34.713
It's the lock, mrs. Van de camp.
It's the mechanism or something.

34:34.783 --> 34:36.993
I'm sure everything
will be back to normal on monday.

34:52.072 --> 34:54.041
Damn it, it can't do the steel.

34:59.934 --> 35:02.148
Thank god I finished recording my demo.

35:03.580 --> 35:05.651
I'm gonna live forever through my music.

35:23.871 --> 35:24.837
How much longer?

35:25.444 --> 35:27.673
Without air?
Nine, maybe ten hours.

35:39.273 --> 35:41.520
There's no air.
Turned it off.

35:45.272 --> 35:47.838
Whatever you do, don't open box 444.

35:48.492 --> 35:50.074
Or the one directly below it.

36:39.755 --> 36:40.681
Monk,

36:43.388 --> 36:45.292
that bracelet's the right shape.

36:45.546 --> 36:47.803
The diamonds might cut through the lock.

36:51.478 --> 36:52.306
But

36:52.771 --> 36:53.532
it's...

36:53.552 --> 36:58.280
I know, it's Trudy's bracelet. But there
might be a phone line in there.

36:59.797 --> 37:01.147
It's our only chance.

37:15.297 --> 37:16.860
Get that necktie.

37:59.565 --> 38:00.587
Thank you.

38:05.299 --> 38:06.321
You're welcome.

38:19.111 --> 38:20.615
No phone lines.

38:44.351 --> 38:46.553
No, maybe not,
but there's the next best thing.

39:13.766 --> 39:14.613
No.

39:16.160 --> 39:17.529
There's nobody out there.

39:21.342 --> 39:22.268
No.

39:22.596 --> 39:23.409
Wait.

39:24.164 --> 39:25.932
No, there is somebody out there.

39:26.406 --> 39:27.737
And I know he's watching.

39:39.362 --> 39:41.202
I can feel it, you son of a bitch.

39:41.974 --> 39:43.749
He's looking right at this thing.

39:45.216 --> 39:46.432
I hate this guy.

40:04.312 --> 40:06.119
Yeah, I'm here at vincent place.

40:06.188 --> 40:07.474
In front of the bank.

40:07.918 --> 40:09.538
I think you better get down here.

40:13.578 --> 40:16.875
As you can imagine, Mr. Monk,
it's been a public relations nightmare.

40:16.911 --> 40:18.184
It's almost unthinkable.

40:18.204 --> 40:21.519
Six employees, the entire branch
planning something like that.

40:21.539 --> 40:24.511
Anyway, there's anything that we can
do for you, anything at all, please.

40:24.531 --> 40:25.872
- No.
- Well,

40:26.047 --> 40:27.650
he could use a new toaster.

40:27.688 --> 40:28.788
Yes, of course!

40:28.949 --> 40:30.203
Of course.

40:30.904 --> 40:32.039
Please.

40:32.831 --> 40:34.418
Take it. Use it in good health.

40:34.892 --> 40:36.339
It's the least we can do.

40:44.188 --> 40:45.556
You just moved.

40:46.319 --> 40:47.650
I saw you.

40:48.008 --> 40:49.069
Did not.

40:49.520 --> 40:51.469
Get off of my corner.

40:52.050 --> 40:55.580
Okay.
Come over here and make me.

40:55.711 --> 40:57.737
You come over here.

40:57.793 --> 40:59.316
You come here.

40:59.470 --> 41:03.672
- You come over here....
- You come over here. You come...

41:11.839 --> 41:12.833
Sucker.

41:12.853 --> 41:16.456
I hate you.
I hate you so much.
