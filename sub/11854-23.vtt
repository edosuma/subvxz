WEBVTT

00:25.375 --> 00:27.917
You know that I would
never ever leave you.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.291
I'd never ever leave you.

00:29.375 --> 00:32.208
And you know that
anything mean you hear

00:32.291 --> 00:34.125
is just jealous people talking.

00:34.208 --> 00:37.792
Oh, no one has what we have.
That's why they're jealous.

00:39.166 --> 00:43.083
I can't wait for Paris
when we're really adults.

00:43.166 --> 00:45.208
I can't wait either.

00:52.959 --> 00:55.250
- Wanna get in the car?
- Uh-huh.

00:55.333 --> 00:56.583
Come on.

00:58.417 --> 00:59.875
Come on!

02:09.458 --> 02:11.834
Who's Anna Mayes?

02:11.917 --> 02:15.583
- Don't know.
- Says she knows you from West.

02:15.667 --> 02:19.458
Oh, her. She's a detective.
Pain in the ass.

02:20.792 --> 02:23.041
Oh, she called Lil.
She's bringing us
something.

02:23.125 --> 02:25.917
How are things going at home?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.709
She went to her sister's.

02:27.792 --> 02:29.375
Well, that's probably good

02:29.458 --> 02:31.291
that she's, uh, got some
company during the day,
huh?

02:31.375 --> 02:32.250
Hm.

02:32.333 --> 02:35.125
Scotty Valens, homicide.

02:35.208 --> 02:37.542
Hey, Anna.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.875
Big time looks good on you.

02:39.959 --> 02:42.125
Anna says all your old CIs
still ask after you.

02:42.208 --> 02:43.417
Is that right?

02:43.500 --> 02:45.709
They miss the steak
dinners in
particular.

02:45.792 --> 02:47.417
This is Lieutenant Stillman.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.000
Detective Mayes, 16th District.

02:49.083 --> 02:51.750
Well, detective, you got
an angle on an old one, huh?

02:51.834 --> 02:53.417
(Anna)
'Sam Terrence. Just arrested
him
on a loitering complaint.'

02:53.500 --> 02:55.208
'Got to talking.'

02:55.291 --> 02:58.166
Turns out he was just sprung
from Camp Hill after 18 years.

02:58.250 --> 02:59.500
- What did he do?
- Nothing.

02:59.583 --> 03:01.834
'He was convicted
of rape and murder.'

03:01.917 --> 03:03.875
DNA just showed they
pinched the wrong
guy.

03:05.625 --> 03:09.208
Sam, join the party.

03:09.291 --> 03:12.000
Hi, Sam.
John Stillman.

03:12.083 --> 03:13.959
Hey, I got to be at
the Budget Wash on time.

03:14.041 --> 03:15.583
I'll get you there.

03:15.667 --> 03:19.125
These detectives wanna hear
about the Eve Kendall murder.

03:19.208 --> 03:20.583
Were you in the area, Sam?

03:20.667 --> 03:22.917
I was collecting
cans in the park.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.250
Middle of the night, I get
picked up and ID'd as a
killer.

03:25.333 --> 03:27.083
- Who ID'd you?
- Boyfriend of the girl.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.583
He was also attacked.

03:28.667 --> 03:31.250
I did almost two dimes for it.

03:31.333 --> 03:33.166
I was a young man
when I went in
there.

03:33.250 --> 03:34.917
Like you.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.166
This was, uh, '86?

03:36.250 --> 03:37.583
Lover's
Lane.
Teenagers.

03:37.667 --> 03:40.625
She's raped and
killed,
he's left for dead.

03:40.709 --> 03:42.458
The least we can do
is figure out whose time

03:42.542 --> 03:44.166
you've been doing.

04:20.250 --> 04:22.667
Eve Kendall, 15.
Died from stab wounds.

04:22.750 --> 04:24.000
No weapon recovered.

04:24.083 --> 04:25.875
Boyfriend Mark Adams
was attacked, too.

04:25.959 --> 04:27.959
Concussion, shallow wounds.

04:28.041 --> 04:29.500
Found at Lover's Lane,
Fairmount Park.

04:29.583 --> 04:31.041
Big make-out place
in the summertime.

04:31.125 --> 04:33.834
So you were there a lot.

04:33.917 --> 04:35.959
How'd Sam become the
whipping boy for this?

04:36.041 --> 04:38.041
Oh, he was half
homeless
and a boozer.

04:38.125 --> 04:39.458
Only person in the area.

04:39.542 --> 04:40.792
Mark ID'd him from a lineup.

04:40.875 --> 04:42.917
An ID we now know as bogus.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.375
That, plus the "shallow wounds"

04:44.458 --> 04:45.834
makes me wanna
talk to Mark again.

04:45.917 --> 04:47.458
Hey, check it out.

04:47.542 --> 04:50.166
- What?
- Kind of looks like you.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.792
Sam told the cops
about a couple parked

04:53.875 --> 04:56.333
in a green Datsun a few
spaces away from Mark and Eve

04:56.417 --> 04:57.709
that night. No follow-up.

04:57.792 --> 04:58.875
They didn't believe him?

04:58.959 --> 05:00.542
So maybe that's a job for you.

05:00.625 --> 05:02.625
What? Tracking green
Datsun's from '86?

05:02.709 --> 05:06.208
[Rush chuckles]
It's glamorous
being in Homicide.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.834
I know I saw that guy.

05:12.667 --> 05:14.041
You got knocked out,
though, right?

05:14.125 --> 05:15.875
But I saw him. I'm positive.

05:15.959 --> 05:18.375
Thing is, an eyewitness
being sure

05:18.458 --> 05:20.166
has no correlation
to them being right.

05:20.250 --> 05:22.208
(Rush)
'Sam Terrence is out of
jail.'

05:22.291 --> 05:24.542
We're looking at other
possibilities now.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.625
I'll help if I can.

05:26.709 --> 05:30.083
Remember seeing anyone else
in the park that night?

05:30.166 --> 05:31.917
It was 18 years ago.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.834
Maybe another couple
parked nearby?

05:33.917 --> 05:36.250
No. I don't remember that.

05:36.333 --> 05:39.333
Were you and Eve having
any problems before she died?

05:39.417 --> 05:40.917
We were completely happy.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.500
Recent fights?

05:42.583 --> 05:45.291
I just said we were
completely happy.

05:46.792 --> 05:49.417
Was she worried about
any unwanted attention?

05:49.500 --> 05:52.417
Eve got all kinds of
attention,
but it didn't worry her.

05:52.500 --> 05:55.959
We'll live in Paris,
like expatriates.

05:56.041 --> 05:58.083
You'll write
plays
for me.

05:58.166 --> 05:59.291
And poems.

05:59.375 --> 06:01.792
And I'll read them
out loud at cafes.

06:04.291 --> 06:05.709
(Mark)
'We'll live in a garret.'

06:05.792 --> 06:08.750
- What's that?
- It's where artists live.

06:08.834 --> 06:09.834
With no heat.

06:12.417 --> 06:14.291
Someone's staring at you.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.000
Oh, come on.

06:19.083 --> 06:22.500
Everyone stares,
'cause you're so
pretty.

06:24.792 --> 06:27.333
- What do we do for money?
- Nothing.

06:27.417 --> 06:30.166
We hate money.

06:30.250 --> 06:31.375
- See you later?
- Okay.

06:32.750 --> 06:33.792
Bye.

06:41.542 --> 06:44.208
What happened to you
being a writer?

06:47.291 --> 06:49.250
Family business.

06:49.333 --> 06:51.250
Ever get you upset..

06:51.333 --> 06:52.542
...all that attention
she got?

06:52.625 --> 06:55.917
No. I felt lucky I was her guy.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.709
Eve was the heartbreak
of my life.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.667
'We were gonna be
together forever.'

07:00.750 --> 07:02.083
First love?

07:02.166 --> 07:04.250
It broke me losing her.

07:05.709 --> 07:08.208
It's weird how much
you look like her.

07:17.041 --> 07:18.458
Wayne Larkin?

07:21.250 --> 07:22.500
Is it about the trash?

07:22.583 --> 07:25.166
It's about Eve Kendall.

07:25.250 --> 07:26.667
(Vera)
'She was murdered.'

07:26.750 --> 07:28.417
1986.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.792
Oh, yeah.

07:30.875 --> 07:34.792
- 'Tryin' to watch the
program.'
- It's the cops, dad.

07:34.875 --> 07:36.417
Outside.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.792
Diabetes and gout.

07:40.875 --> 07:43.667
- So how did you know Eve?
- We both worked at the mall.

07:43.750 --> 07:46.250
We were sort of weekend friends.

07:46.333 --> 07:49.083
In our write-up, it says
you saw her the day she died.

07:49.166 --> 07:52.083
Uh...around 5 o'clock,
after work.

07:52.166 --> 07:53.709
Saw her at the bus stop.

07:53.792 --> 07:56.041
Her boyfriend Mark
didn't
pick her up after work?

07:56.125 --> 07:58.875
Oh, he dropped her off a lot,
but she took the bus home.

07:58.959 --> 08:01.333
She talk about her
boyfriend to you?

08:01.417 --> 08:05.458
Yeah. I guess he was
pretty possessive.

08:05.542 --> 08:06.709
Really?

08:06.792 --> 08:09.333
Yeah, but I don't think
the feeling was mutual.

08:09.417 --> 08:10.625
She was still, uh..

08:10.709 --> 08:13.750
You know, looking around.

08:14.792 --> 08:16.375
You work till 11:30?

08:16.458 --> 08:18.709
Yeah, 'cause after the
movie
I gotta sweep up

08:18.792 --> 08:20.250
all the popcorn
and leftover junk.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.250
That's so late.

08:22.333 --> 08:25.375
You're a Summer.
You should wear baby
pink.

08:25.458 --> 08:28.917
I don't mind.
I like being at work.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.542
Uh, you know,
I-I can get you in free.

08:31.625 --> 08:32.917
Yeah?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.417
Yeah. Tonight even,
if you want.

08:35.500 --> 08:38.750
'"Top Gun" at 7 and 9:30.'

08:38.834 --> 08:40.250
Maybe.

08:48.166 --> 08:49.875
Remember me?

08:49.959 --> 08:51.458
Yeah.

08:51.542 --> 08:54.375
Peach-banana,
well-blended.

08:54.458 --> 08:56.542
You move pretty good.

08:56.625 --> 08:58.041
Thanks.

08:58.125 --> 08:59.917
You sing, too?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.583
Yeah, I sing.

09:01.667 --> 09:04.250
So you ever gonna
take me up on my offer?

09:04.333 --> 09:05.458
You mean about 3-2-1?

09:05.542 --> 09:07.709
Yeah.
It's a hot place.

09:07.792 --> 09:09.333
(Eve)
'I don't have ID.'

09:09.417 --> 09:11.375
I'll get you in.

09:11.458 --> 09:13.750
Can my friend come?

09:13.834 --> 09:16.000
Sure.

09:16.083 --> 09:17.500
How's tonight?

09:22.875 --> 09:25.500
My mom leaves for work at 8.

09:31.375 --> 09:33.291
So, who was this guy?

09:33.375 --> 09:34.917
Worked in the music store.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.792
I guess they met
at the food court.

09:36.875 --> 09:38.083
You remember a name?

09:38.166 --> 09:40.959
You know,
I wanna say Max, uh..

09:41.041 --> 09:43.500
But it was a pretty
long time ago.

09:45.583 --> 09:47.500
Mark has this girl
up on a pedestal.

09:47.583 --> 09:50.333
She was everything to him,
his one and only.

09:50.417 --> 09:52.208
But he apparently wasn't hers.

09:52.291 --> 09:54.792
Sounds like the older dude
took her out at least once.

09:54.875 --> 09:56.333
Hmm, a week before
she bought it.

09:56.417 --> 09:58.250
So, either Mark was
totally in the dark

09:58.333 --> 10:00.709
or he knew about
the extracurriculars.

10:00.792 --> 10:03.500
- Maybe did something about
it.
- Him being "possessive."

10:03.583 --> 10:07.500
Oh, 16 years old, I find out
my girl's steppin' out on me?

10:07.583 --> 10:09.083
That feels like
the end of the world.

10:09.166 --> 10:11.625
Oh, pretty vicious crime
for a teenage doer.

10:11.709 --> 10:14.542
Wouldn't set
any records,
Lil.

10:15.667 --> 10:17.834
- Thank you.
- Must be Eve's mom.

10:20.041 --> 10:23.709
She was a super nice kid.
No enemies.

10:23.792 --> 10:26.375
Any strange behavior from
her
those last few weeks?

10:26.458 --> 10:28.709
Strange behavior
was constant.

10:28.792 --> 10:30.291
One thing
was a little off.

10:30.375 --> 10:32.792
She wanted to
borrow 200 bucks.

10:32.875 --> 10:35.291
'Wouldn't say why.'

10:35.375 --> 10:36.917
What'd you think
of her boyfriend
Mark?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.875
Nice. Especially for a rich kid.

10:39.959 --> 10:41.208
'He treat Eve okay?'

10:41.291 --> 10:43.375
Yeah. He called about
four times a night.

10:43.458 --> 10:44.709
Like he was checking up on her?

10:44.792 --> 10:47.959
I just took it as kids in love.

10:48.041 --> 10:49.542
Did you ever hear
of a guy named Max?

10:49.625 --> 10:51.375
Oh, you bet I did.

10:51.458 --> 10:53.709
That jerk came to my house.

10:55.917 --> 10:58.959
Don't forget to call
before you go to sleep.

11:00.083 --> 11:02.834
What? Your tummy hurt?

11:02.917 --> 11:04.542
No. I don't know.

11:04.625 --> 11:07.375
- Need me to stay home, baby?
- No. Mom, go.

11:13.959 --> 11:15.750
Uh..

11:15.834 --> 11:17.458
Good evening.

11:17.542 --> 11:18.458
Yes?

11:18.542 --> 11:20.792
Is Eve here?

11:20.875 --> 11:23.834
- Who are you?
- I'm Max...Tanning.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.375
Well, turn around, Max.

11:25.458 --> 11:26.417
Mom!

11:26.500 --> 11:28.917
- How old are you?
- Um..

11:29.000 --> 11:31.583
'Cause she's 15!

11:31.667 --> 11:32.792
Okay.

11:32.875 --> 11:34.583
'No harm, no foul.'

11:34.667 --> 11:36.041
Walk away.

11:39.917 --> 11:41.250
Mother!

11:43.333 --> 11:44.625
- Wipe that make-up off.
- Why?

11:44.709 --> 11:46.583
You don't know how
you look to the world.

11:46.667 --> 11:48.959
- What are you talking about?
- 'Cause you're young.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.500
But not so young that
people don't see you

11:51.583 --> 11:52.709
and think things.

11:52.792 --> 11:54.709
- I can handle it, mom!
- And want things.

11:54.792 --> 11:57.792
- You don't even understand.
- I can handle it!

12:00.291 --> 12:02.041
Did Mark know about this guy?

12:02.125 --> 12:03.500
I don't know.

12:03.583 --> 12:06.458
There was a lot
I didn't know with Eve.

12:06.542 --> 12:09.375
She was in that
hard teenage stage.

12:09.458 --> 12:11.291
I'm familiar.

12:11.375 --> 12:15.291
[sighs]
I...was just waiting
till she got..

12:15.375 --> 12:17.917
...to her 20s.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
We could be friends again.

12:20.083 --> 12:21.375
Right.

12:23.125 --> 12:25.333
But we never got there.

12:29.875 --> 12:32.667
If I'm a 15-year-old girl,
why do I need 200 bucks?

12:32.750 --> 12:35.000
And why not get it
from the rich
boyfriend?

12:35.083 --> 12:37.208
Maybe it has something
to do with this older
guy.

12:37.291 --> 12:39.500
You mean something she didn't
want Mark knowing about.

12:39.583 --> 12:41.834
Her mom said Eve
was feeling queasy

12:41.917 --> 12:43.291
the night creepo came over?

12:43.375 --> 12:45.625
- Pregnant?
- Maybe he knocked her up.

12:45.709 --> 12:48.041
'She can't tell mom
or home-slice Mark.'

12:48.125 --> 12:49.291
Autopsy didn't show that.

12:49.375 --> 12:50.709
Well, let's double-check.

12:50.792 --> 12:52.667
Well, that would give motive
to the older guy

12:52.750 --> 12:54.041
say she wanted to keep it.

12:54.125 --> 12:56.667
Or Mark, same motive.

12:56.750 --> 12:59.500
Let me go back to him. Solo.

12:59.583 --> 13:02.834
I better jet.
I'll go down with you.

13:02.917 --> 13:04.834
My boss sends his regards.

13:04.917 --> 13:06.166
'Lieutenant Doherty.'

13:06.250 --> 13:08.667
Yeah, we worked
the streets
together.

13:08.750 --> 13:10.166
And if you got an extra
desk around here

13:10.250 --> 13:11.542
he'll recommend me for keeps.

13:11.625 --> 13:12.709
Subtle, Mayes.

13:15.458 --> 13:18.291
You two wanna find creepo?

13:20.333 --> 13:22.875
So...Eve being pregnant?

13:22.959 --> 13:24.709
[sighs]
It's impossible.

13:24.792 --> 13:26.542
How come?

13:26.625 --> 13:28.625
We hadn't gone all the way yet.

13:28.709 --> 13:31.166
That garret in Paris,
that was gonna be the place.

13:31.250 --> 13:32.875
But if there was
another
guy in the picture.

13:32.959 --> 13:35.875
- No. No.
- There was, Mark.

13:35.959 --> 13:39.041
- Someone named Max.
- There was no other guy. Okay?

13:39.125 --> 13:41.083
You don't...
you didn't know Eve.

13:41.166 --> 13:43.375
I know what it's like being 15.

13:43.458 --> 13:46.500
How flattering it is to have an
older guy giving you attention.

13:46.583 --> 13:47.917
Eve wouldn't have cheated on me.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.959
And what if she did?
What would you have done to her?

13:50.041 --> 13:52.041
I didn't kill her.

13:52.125 --> 13:53.291
I loved her.

13:53.375 --> 13:54.750
People kill people they love.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.417
I got attacked myself,
for God's sake.

13:56.500 --> 14:00.834
She was murdered.
You had minor wounds.

14:00.917 --> 14:03.333
Do you have a soul mate?

14:03.417 --> 14:05.375
'Cause if you did,
you'd understand Eve and me.

14:05.458 --> 14:07.709
I understand you were
controlling with her.

14:07.792 --> 14:10.458
So you've never been
in love like that.

14:13.750 --> 14:16.000
Mark?

14:16.083 --> 14:17.166
You'll pick 'em up?

14:17.250 --> 14:18.417
Yeah.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.166
(Wendy)
'5 o'clock.'

14:22.750 --> 14:25.208
Uh...we've been
having a rocky time.

14:25.291 --> 14:27.750
She senses the truth.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.333
Which is?

14:31.917 --> 14:34.542
That I loved Eve
more than anyone.

14:47.417 --> 14:48.959
Vaguely familiar.

14:49.041 --> 14:50.000
(Jeffries)
'1986.'

14:50.083 --> 14:51.750
Worked at the Smoothie Spot.

14:51.834 --> 14:53.291
You went to her house one night

14:53.375 --> 14:55.250
her mom made you
for the sleazebag you
were

14:55.333 --> 14:56.750
kicked your ass out.

14:56.834 --> 14:58.458
Oh, her.

14:58.542 --> 15:00.500
One of the many
youngsters in your
past?

15:00.583 --> 15:03.625
I met her at the food court.
Struck up a conversation.

15:03.709 --> 15:06.500
Eventually I asked her
did she want to go dancing.

15:06.583 --> 15:08.959
Is that all you were
after,
a dance partner?

15:09.041 --> 15:11.583
Did I find her attractive? Yes.

15:11.667 --> 15:14.917
- Did I know she was 15? No.
- So you made a date with her.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.083
Hey, let's not make her
the babe in the woods

15:17.166 --> 15:18.834
and me the Big Bad Wolf
here, okay?

15:18.917 --> 15:22.375
- Sounds accurate to me.
- I made an honest mistake.

15:22.458 --> 15:25.792
Her mom flew in on
the broomstick, I split.

15:25.875 --> 15:29.000
Hour later,
who shows up at the club.

15:32.375 --> 15:33.417
Max.

15:34.458 --> 15:35.834
Hi.

15:35.917 --> 15:37.667
Well, look at that.

15:37.750 --> 15:39.542
- You made it.
- Yeah.

15:39.625 --> 15:41.542
My mom finally left.

15:41.625 --> 15:43.375
No problems getting in?

15:43.458 --> 15:44.709
They didn't even ask.

15:44.792 --> 15:47.000
The world smiles
on pretty girls.

15:47.083 --> 15:50.208
[chuckles]
Uh, you remember
my friend Carrie.

15:50.291 --> 15:52.166
- How you doin'?
- Hi.

15:52.250 --> 15:55.834
Let me ask you something. You
ever think about making a
video?

15:55.917 --> 15:57.041
What do you mean?

15:57.125 --> 15:58.667
You've seen MTV, right?

15:58.750 --> 16:01.709
- Cyndi Lauper, Madonna.
- Belinda Carlisle.

16:01.792 --> 16:04.291
''Cause I think
you got something.'

16:04.375 --> 16:06.625
- Really?
- My store in Atlantic City.

16:06.709 --> 16:08.834
We have this sound booth.
We could book some time.

16:08.917 --> 16:11.417
Make a demo,
see how it goes.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.208
I've never been
to Atlantic City.

16:13.291 --> 16:16.375
I'm going next weekend.
I'm staying with my cousin.

16:16.458 --> 16:18.333
Think about it.

16:18.417 --> 16:19.917
Come on, let's dance.

16:29.291 --> 16:32.625
Danced a few dances,
then I lost her.

16:32.709 --> 16:33.875
She left with her friend.

16:33.959 --> 16:35.542
You didn't take
her
to Atlantic City?

16:35.625 --> 16:38.375
Nah. That was just dumb talk.

16:38.458 --> 16:39.667
(Jeffries)
'Did she know that?'

16:42.542 --> 16:45.458
Hey, how much did it cost,
renting that sound booth?

16:45.542 --> 16:47.542
Two hundred bucks
a session.

16:49.250 --> 16:52.083
The autopsy's conclusive.
Eve wasn't pregnant.

16:52.166 --> 16:54.917
In fact, she was probably
a virgin before the rape.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.375
Well, that backs up
Mark's claim.

16:56.458 --> 16:58.542
- And I guess Max's.
- What's his story?

16:58.625 --> 17:01.208
Well, he and Eve talked
about making a demo
video.

17:01.291 --> 17:03.750
- Price tag, 200 bucks.
- Oh. What kind of video?

17:03.834 --> 17:06.375
Singing and dancing, 'cause
maybe she was the new Madonna.

17:06.458 --> 17:08.917
Oh, that'll work
on a 15-year-old.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.959
Vera found Eve's friend
Carrie.
He's upstairs with her now.

17:12.041 --> 17:15.583
Well, maybe she knows where Eve
came down on Max versus Mark.

17:17.500 --> 17:20.542
I remember Max.
From the music store.

17:20.625 --> 17:22.625
Him and Eve have
something going on?

17:22.709 --> 17:25.250
She had a boyfriend...Mark.

17:25.333 --> 17:28.041
- We've met him.
- Yeah, she really loved him.

17:28.125 --> 17:31.875
So why's she sneaking out
at night to go meet Max?

17:31.959 --> 17:33.875
We were kids, you know.

17:33.959 --> 17:37.250
Max says he never saw Eve
after that night at 3-2-1.

17:37.333 --> 17:39.625
He didn't mention Atlantic City?

17:39.709 --> 17:41.166
Said that idea never took off.

17:41.250 --> 17:43.625
No, they were going.

17:43.709 --> 17:46.208
It was all she talked
about the next day.

17:51.250 --> 17:54.792
Thanks, Wayne. And don't
tell about Atlantic City.

17:54.875 --> 17:57.667
I don't think it's a good idea,
Eve. I don't trust that Max guy.

17:57.750 --> 17:59.083
Me, neither.

17:59.166 --> 18:00.500
Well, he wants me
to make a video.

18:00.583 --> 18:02.583
(Carrie)
'You know what he really
wants.'

18:02.667 --> 18:03.667
Come on.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.208
Personally...I think
he's sleazy.

18:05.291 --> 18:07.625
Why do you want
to do that to Mark, anyway?

18:07.709 --> 18:09.667
I'm not doing anything to Mark.

18:09.750 --> 18:11.959
I think he just wants
to make a move on you.

18:12.041 --> 18:14.667
Well, I wouldn't let
that happen, okay?

18:17.083 --> 18:19.458
Hey, you wanna
go do something?

18:19.542 --> 18:21.000
The three of us?

18:21.083 --> 18:24.834
Well, I'm meeting Mark.
But you and Carrie should go.

18:38.250 --> 18:41.125
Her boyfriend's like the
nicest
guy in the whole school.

18:41.208 --> 18:44.750
Yeah, I've seen him.
He brings her to work
sometimes.

18:47.291 --> 18:50.041
I could get us free
into the movies. "Top Gun."

18:50.125 --> 18:51.875
I already saw it.

18:51.959 --> 18:53.959
[chuckles]
Me too.

18:57.583 --> 19:00.375
You ever just wanna leave?

19:00.458 --> 19:03.250
Just go away, forever?

19:03.333 --> 19:07.375
[sighs]
Drive and drive,
till you get to California?

19:09.166 --> 19:10.750
'Not really.'

19:13.041 --> 19:15.125
[sighs]
Wanna hang out?

19:16.583 --> 19:17.750
Okay.

19:22.291 --> 19:23.709
We both told Eve not to go

19:23.792 --> 19:27.500
but, well, she kept saying
she could handle it.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.750
Hey, what kind of car
did Wayne drive?

19:30.834 --> 19:33.750
This, umm, beat-up old Datsun.

19:37.208 --> 19:38.709
Carrie said that
Wayne from the mall

19:38.792 --> 19:41.333
drove a green Datsun in '86.

19:41.417 --> 19:45.834
A '78 B-210 was registered to
a Jim Larkin. Probably his
dad.

19:45.917 --> 19:49.667
The same type of car Sam thought
he saw the night Eve was killed.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.792
Hey.

19:53.166 --> 19:55.333
Don't look so wonderful,
cops comin' here for me.

19:55.417 --> 19:57.709
I badged the boss.
Told him what it's about.

19:59.333 --> 20:02.250
I want you to look
at some pictures, Sam.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.750
That's the guy in the Datsun.

20:06.834 --> 20:08.250
(Jeffries)
'You sure?'

20:08.333 --> 20:10.208
I mean, I don't want
to say definitely but..

20:10.291 --> 20:12.000
You think you saw him before.

20:12.083 --> 20:13.917
[panting]
That night.

20:23.917 --> 20:27.542
It's what my mind is telling
me,
but I wouldn't swear to it.

20:27.625 --> 20:30.083
But your gut reaction is,
this kid was there that
night.

20:30.166 --> 20:33.458
[panting]
With a heavy-looking girl.

20:33.542 --> 20:34.917
Heavy, huh?

20:35.000 --> 20:37.834
But I couldn't put my hand
on a Bible and say it.

20:39.709 --> 20:41.542
I better jump back in here.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.291
An eyewitnesses puts you
at the scene, Wayne.

20:53.542 --> 20:55.250
- What do you mean?
- 'Lover's Lane.'

20:55.333 --> 20:57.125
You were there that night.

20:57.208 --> 20:59.625
In your Datsun with a girl.

20:59.709 --> 21:02.333
- No.
- A big girl. Like Carrie.

21:02.417 --> 21:04.667
[chuckles]
That's
crazy.

21:04.750 --> 21:07.208
See, I think you
had it bad for Eve.

21:07.291 --> 21:10.000
But you didn't have a shot there

21:10.083 --> 21:12.583
so you went for the friend.
That's common enough.

21:12.667 --> 21:13.834
I gotta be at the airport.

21:13.917 --> 21:15.458
So, you go parking with Carrie.

21:15.542 --> 21:17.750
But she's not really
rocking your world.

21:17.834 --> 21:20.250
After a few tall Boys,
you're feeling pretty loose.

21:20.333 --> 21:23.000
And there's Eve with Mark,
just a few spaces over

21:23.083 --> 21:25.291
doing stuff she'd never
do to Wayne Larkin.

21:25.375 --> 21:27.709
I was never at
Lover's Lane with
Carrie.

21:27.792 --> 21:29.000
You can polygraph me.

21:29.083 --> 21:31.166
You hung out with her
the weekend before.

21:31.250 --> 21:33.959
- Carrie told us.
- We watched TV.

21:34.041 --> 21:37.709
I didn't dig her, she didn't
dig me. It was a nonevent.

21:37.792 --> 21:41.625
Were you pissed off about Eve
going to Atlantic City, Wayne?

21:41.709 --> 21:44.709
[sighs]
I thought it was a bad idea,
but it was her life.

21:44.792 --> 21:46.959
- So you didn't try to stop
her?
- I helped her.

21:47.041 --> 21:49.542
She borrowed 200 bucks,
so she could run off

21:49.625 --> 21:51.709
with that statutory rapist.

21:51.792 --> 21:52.750
You loaned Eve the money?

21:52.834 --> 21:56.834
And that guy Max was so sleazy

21:56.917 --> 21:59.917
he wouldn't give it
back to me after she died.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.041
There was no trip
to Atlantic City.

22:02.125 --> 22:04.208
Yeah, but there
was supposed to be.

22:04.291 --> 22:06.834
Eve even gave you the money.

22:06.917 --> 22:08.709
- She was a kid.
- 'That wasn't stopping you.'

22:08.792 --> 22:11.709
You had it all set up for
a Saturday night score in AC.

22:11.792 --> 22:14.000
I'm telling you,
she was a kid.

22:14.083 --> 22:15.250
Well, you liked kids.

22:15.333 --> 22:17.000
That's why you
hung out at 3-2-1.

22:17.083 --> 22:19.917
Too bad that joint got shut
down for serving to minors.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.917
Where do you hang out now,
high schools?

22:22.000 --> 22:25.750
[chuckles]
I didn't do
anything to that girl.

22:25.834 --> 22:27.458
I'm the one who called it off.

22:39.291 --> 22:40.750
You ready?

22:40.834 --> 22:42.375
I'm ready.

22:44.166 --> 22:46.417
What's the sleeping bag for?

22:46.500 --> 22:48.208
Well, we're staying over, right?

22:48.291 --> 22:51.041
Yeah, but you're not
gonna need that.

22:51.125 --> 22:53.333
- Is there a guest room?
- No.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.041
Then..

22:57.125 --> 22:58.875
...where am I sleeping?

22:58.959 --> 23:02.875
Eve, we're going on
a trip here. Together.

23:02.959 --> 23:05.333
Yeah, I know.

23:07.083 --> 23:09.458
Okay, you a grown-up or not?

23:09.542 --> 23:11.458
'Cause if not,
you should stay here.

23:11.542 --> 23:13.625
Go have hot fudge sundaes with
your girlfriend, you know?

23:13.709 --> 23:15.333
Play dolls.

23:15.417 --> 23:18.083
You wanna go with me,
you gotta be an adult.

23:19.875 --> 23:21.875
So you tell me.

23:21.959 --> 23:23.834
You a kid?

23:23.917 --> 23:25.750
Or are you a grown-up?

23:34.208 --> 23:37.291
I guess I'm gonna
need my 200 bucks back.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.667
The money's already spent.

23:40.750 --> 23:42.542
- But..
- It's spent.

23:44.542 --> 23:47.333
Didn't get the booty you wanted,
figured you were owed something?

23:47.417 --> 23:50.000
Sounds more like petty
theft than "calling it
off."

23:50.083 --> 23:53.166
The point is, we didn't
go anywhere that day.

23:53.250 --> 23:55.875
And that was the
last I ever saw her.

23:59.625 --> 24:01.166
(Kite)
'So the DA's really enjoying'

24:01.250 --> 24:03.834
all the publicity on him
blowing the Kendall case.

24:05.583 --> 24:07.000
That's his problem.

24:07.083 --> 24:08.333
'Yeah, and mine.'

24:08.417 --> 24:10.875
If he ships me off
to Welfare Fraud.

24:10.959 --> 24:13.417
[scoffs]
For what?

24:13.500 --> 24:16.375
For associating
with the
troublemaker.

24:23.041 --> 24:24.875
What, your dealer?

24:31.291 --> 24:33.834
Hi.

24:33.917 --> 24:35.375
- Hi.
- I'm sorry.

24:35.458 --> 24:37.792
I-I just needed to..

24:37.875 --> 24:39.500
[sighs]
I looked you up.

24:42.417 --> 24:44.250
I-I keep thinking about her.

24:48.458 --> 24:50.583
Uh, I-I'll just be five minutes.

25:00.333 --> 25:03.083
(Mark)
'She'd hate who I am now.'

25:03.166 --> 25:04.542
Workaday.

25:04.625 --> 25:06.375
<i>Bourgeois.</i>

25:06.458 --> 25:09.291
- Practical.
- Yeah.

25:09.375 --> 25:13.166
But we wanted-we wanted
exciting lives. Like yours.

25:15.375 --> 25:18.000
Oh, it's, uh,
not so
exciting.

25:18.083 --> 25:19.667
- No?
- 'No.'

25:19.750 --> 25:23.417
It's more like I
watch
other people's
lives

25:23.500 --> 25:26.417
'from a front row seat.'

25:26.500 --> 25:29.333
Are you...who you
thought you'd be?

25:29.417 --> 25:30.834
I mean, when you were 15?

25:30.917 --> 25:33.792
Huh, no, no, I..

25:33.875 --> 25:37.500
I had a whole other
plan
for what I wanted.

25:37.583 --> 25:38.875
And?

25:40.834 --> 25:43.375
It was impossible.

25:48.917 --> 25:51.625
Well, I'm glad you came along.

25:51.709 --> 25:54.750
I mean, I feel..
I feel awake again.

25:54.834 --> 25:56.291
Well, you've..

25:56.375 --> 25:59.625
...you've been...living a life.

25:59.709 --> 26:00.792
No.

26:00.875 --> 26:04.625
I've been going through paces.

26:04.709 --> 26:07.208
Like it was all forgotten,
buried away with her.

26:07.291 --> 26:10.000
But now..

26:10.083 --> 26:13.125
[sighs]
...I remember everything.

26:13.208 --> 26:14.583
It floods back, huh?

26:16.959 --> 26:18.583
Like it was yesterday.

26:26.917 --> 26:28.250
I still love her.

26:31.417 --> 26:32.709
- Mark.
- Damn it.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.667
Wendy knows and I-I..

26:34.750 --> 26:36.583
...I couldn't
stay there tonight.

26:36.667 --> 26:38.875
I just-I just
wanted to be with..

26:40.375 --> 26:41.917
...with her.

26:44.667 --> 26:46.917
And I found myself
coming to you.

26:54.750 --> 26:57.375
Oh, crap, it's..

26:57.458 --> 26:59.166
It's 3.

26:59.250 --> 27:00.667
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

27:00.750 --> 27:03.417
Oh, uh, I-I
lost..
I lost track of
time.

27:03.500 --> 27:04.750
Oh, well, you're busy,
you're busy.

27:04.834 --> 27:06.333
- So I'll see you tomorrow.
- Kite..

27:06.417 --> 27:07.834
I'll see you tomorrow.

27:13.208 --> 27:14.750
(Valens)
'We got a new theory,
Carrie.'

27:16.083 --> 27:18.709
- You and Wayne.
- Me and Wayne, what?

27:18.792 --> 27:21.542
You were both nursing some
hard feelings towards Eve.

27:21.625 --> 27:23.083
Him 'cause he was
so hung up on her

27:23.166 --> 27:24.542
and you 'cause she
got
all that attention.

27:24.625 --> 27:26.166
Maybe you two got tired of her

27:26.250 --> 27:28.417
being the queen bee
all the time.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.458
Started talking revenge.

27:30.542 --> 27:32.333
I didn't talk to
Wayne about anything.

27:32.417 --> 27:35.959
I know what it's like being the
fat kid in high school, Carrie.

27:36.041 --> 27:39.166
- It's a misery.
- It's not great.

27:39.250 --> 27:41.875
Changing for gym class
in front of everybody.

27:41.959 --> 27:43.041
'Going to pool parties'

27:43.125 --> 27:44.875
'and wearing your shirt
the whole time.'

27:44.959 --> 27:47.375
'Girls like Eve prancing
around
in bikinis, getting ogled.'

27:47.458 --> 27:51.250
Always their friend,
never the girlfriend, right?

27:51.333 --> 27:53.750
'That could lead to
some dark thoughts.'

27:56.083 --> 27:59.583
Maybe Wayne did something...
but not me.

27:59.667 --> 28:01.333
Wayne's car was
seen at Lover's
Lane.

28:01.417 --> 28:04.542
The night of the
murder.
Two people inside.

28:04.625 --> 28:07.709
(Vera)
'We were thinking
it was you with him.'

28:07.792 --> 28:09.583
You must be joking.

28:12.166 --> 28:13.375
I hated Wayne.

28:13.458 --> 28:15.250
Oh, what was to hate?

28:19.000 --> 28:20.417
Oh, I-I love this
part
when the..

28:20.500 --> 28:24.000
when the pizza comes
to Mr. Hand's class.

28:24.083 --> 28:26.000
Yeah, it's funny.

28:32.542 --> 28:34.291
'Oh, dad.'

28:34.375 --> 28:35.959
I thought you were asleep.

28:37.917 --> 28:41.750
Well, how's it going?

28:41.834 --> 28:44.291
(Carrie)
'Good.'

28:44.375 --> 28:45.792
You've seen this before?

28:45.875 --> 28:47.000
Yeah.

28:47.083 --> 28:49.750
[chuckles]
Come in here.

28:49.834 --> 28:51.500
'I got something better on.'

28:51.583 --> 28:52.500
(Carrie)
'I don't know.'

28:52.583 --> 28:54.875
But bring the beers with you.

28:54.959 --> 28:56.458
'No big deal.'

28:58.834 --> 29:00.417
Are you coming?

29:00.500 --> 29:02.625
Uh, I-I really wanna watch this.

29:11.166 --> 29:13.667
Can't you ever bring a good one?

29:21.166 --> 29:24.667
What happened in the bedroom?

29:24.750 --> 29:26.291
What do you think?

29:33.125 --> 29:35.166
And you didn't report it?

29:37.417 --> 29:39.583
"Mom, could we call the cops?

29:39.667 --> 29:41.041
"'Cause I got drunk
with some guy

29:41.125 --> 29:43.792
and then his dad
to come into his room."

29:43.875 --> 29:44.834
Right.

29:44.917 --> 29:47.333
And there's the
humiliation factor.

29:49.458 --> 29:51.667
After he finished..

29:53.417 --> 29:56.417
...he told me to get
my giant ass out.

30:05.792 --> 30:08.375
You bring girls home to your
dad as a regular thing, Wayne?

30:08.458 --> 30:10.792
We've been talking
to Carrie Plummer again.

30:10.875 --> 30:13.291
- I should be working.
- Forget work.

30:16.041 --> 30:17.041
He made me.

30:17.125 --> 30:19.875
- 'Made you what?'
- Get girls.

30:19.959 --> 30:22.625
You were 18, Wayne.
That's an adult.

30:22.709 --> 30:26.041
He terrorized me my whole
life.
He still does.

30:26.125 --> 30:29.375
You still go trolling for
girls,
bring 'em home to dad?

30:29.458 --> 30:31.917
No. That stopped.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.750
When?

30:33.834 --> 30:35.291
After Eve.

30:36.667 --> 30:38.000
You brought Eve home?

30:39.500 --> 30:40.959
My dad's gonna kill me.

30:41.041 --> 30:42.250
Come on, Wayne.

30:44.667 --> 30:46.834
The right thing is to tell.

30:48.667 --> 30:50.750
Win or lose, I should tell.

30:51.875 --> 30:53.250
That day

30:53.333 --> 30:56.041
when I saw her at the bus stop..

31:02.583 --> 31:04.166
Thought you left already.

31:05.917 --> 31:07.458
Yeah.

31:07.542 --> 31:09.625
What about Atlantic City?

31:10.625 --> 31:11.959
I didn't go.

31:23.375 --> 31:25.542
'So you're not gonna
make that video?'

31:30.542 --> 31:32.667
I gotta make it up to Mark.

31:33.875 --> 31:36.625
Do I tell him and
ask to be forgiven?

31:37.917 --> 31:41.458
Or do I never let him
know how stupid I was?

31:44.166 --> 31:45.750
Don't ask me.

31:48.834 --> 31:50.709
Could you give me a ride, Wayne?

31:52.709 --> 31:55.417
I gotta be home. My-my
dad's
medication time is soon.

31:55.500 --> 31:58.041
Okay, well, I'll go with you
and then you can drop me off.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.458
I have to change to meet Mark.

31:59.542 --> 32:03.500
Uh, it's probably
not a good idea.

32:03.583 --> 32:04.834
Why not?

32:07.875 --> 32:09.959
How about we go away?

32:11.250 --> 32:12.625
What?

32:12.709 --> 32:14.750
Drive and drive.

32:14.834 --> 32:17.750
As far away as we can
go.
Towards California.

32:19.583 --> 32:21.291
What are you
talking about, Wayne?

32:21.375 --> 32:24.208
Taking you to California.

32:24.291 --> 32:26.291
Wouldn't you like that?

32:26.375 --> 32:28.291
'Cause I would.

32:28.375 --> 32:30.083
I would love that.

32:32.792 --> 32:34.083
That's crazy.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.333
Yeah.

32:40.500 --> 32:41.959
'Course, it is.

32:44.917 --> 32:46.000
Hop in.

32:47.875 --> 32:50.875
After Carrie..

32:50.959 --> 32:52.375
...dad wanted a good one.

32:52.458 --> 32:54.375
So you brought him Eve.

32:54.458 --> 32:58.250
Usually I could only get girls
from the theater to come back.

32:58.333 --> 33:00.375
'Girls I let in
for free, you know?'

33:00.458 --> 33:02.291
They were mostly..

33:03.083 --> 33:05.375
...homely and all.

33:05.458 --> 33:07.750
But dad got real
excited
when he saw Eve.

33:07.834 --> 33:09.709
And he did to her
what he did to Carrie?

33:09.792 --> 33:12.041
He tried.

33:12.125 --> 33:13.458
She called him names.

33:15.125 --> 33:18.041
Ran out of there, said
she would tell the cops.

33:18.125 --> 33:21.041
And that got him mad
like I've never seen.

33:22.625 --> 33:26.792
- So what did he do about it?
- I can't say anymore.

33:26.875 --> 33:29.417
He'd kill me.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.583
I don't wanna talk anymore.

33:34.166 --> 33:36.583
Remember the "fat girl" Sam
thought he saw with Wayne?

33:36.667 --> 33:38.583
We think it was
actually Pops Larkin.

33:38.667 --> 33:41.917
The guy is "Jabba The Hutt"
with a mullet.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.667
From the back, at night.

33:43.750 --> 33:45.417
You think they
were targeting
Eve?

33:45.500 --> 33:47.166
Wayne brought her
home earlier that day.

33:47.250 --> 33:49.250
Jabba tried to grope her,
she didn't go for it.

33:49.333 --> 33:51.250
Sassed him pretty good.
Said she'd rat him out.

33:51.333 --> 33:54.500
So he and Wayne went driving
that night, found Eve and
Mark.

33:54.583 --> 33:55.834
Where is this Jabba?

33:55.917 --> 33:57.583
Drunk in front of
the tube probably.

33:57.667 --> 33:59.458
He don't leave the hut.

33:59.542 --> 34:01.083
(Stillman)
'He does now.'

34:03.333 --> 34:04.834
You guys go ahead.

34:08.750 --> 34:10.458
(Mark)
'So, thanks.'

34:10.542 --> 34:12.125
Umm..

34:12.208 --> 34:14.625
[clicks tongue]
And sorry...about the..

34:16.041 --> 34:17.542
It's okay.

34:18.375 --> 34:21.208
I've-I've made a mess..

34:21.291 --> 34:23.291
...of my marriage and..

34:23.375 --> 34:24.959
- ...your situation.
- I said it's okay.

34:25.041 --> 34:28.667
And I don't know
what I'm gonna to
do.

34:28.750 --> 34:31.041
'Cause this-this Eve thing..

34:31.125 --> 34:32.834
Mark..

34:32.917 --> 34:35.667
...she was as sweet..

34:35.750 --> 34:38.208
...as you remember.

34:38.291 --> 34:41.041
But she was mixed up too.

34:41.125 --> 34:43.333
Like any 15-year-old.

34:43.417 --> 34:45.333
You're talking about
that older guy.

34:45.417 --> 34:48.375
I'm just saying even
if she had lived

34:48.458 --> 34:51.667
you still might not have
the life you talked about.

34:51.750 --> 34:53.166
'Cause you were kids

34:53.250 --> 34:54.750
when you dreamed it up.

34:56.542 --> 34:57.500
Maybe.

35:00.166 --> 35:02.166
Or maybe..

35:02.250 --> 35:06.083
...maybe she was the best
thing
that ever came my way.

35:06.166 --> 35:09.625
And nothing that good
is possible again.

35:09.709 --> 35:11.917
Now, let's say that's true.

35:14.000 --> 35:14.959
But you're here.

35:17.667 --> 35:19.166
She's not.

35:20.583 --> 35:21.583
No.

35:23.542 --> 35:25.458
But..

35:26.917 --> 35:28.667
I'm not her.

35:31.625 --> 35:32.667
No.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.583
I gotta be someplace.

35:55.417 --> 35:58.041
I'm really sorry.

35:58.125 --> 36:00.291
Yeah, yeah, me, too.

36:02.125 --> 36:03.417
What happened with that guy?

36:03.500 --> 36:05.375
Oh, he left.

36:05.458 --> 36:07.291
Five minutes after you did.

36:07.375 --> 36:10.750
You got a funny definition
of five minutes.

36:10.834 --> 36:12.583
- It was work, Kite.
- Really?

36:12.667 --> 36:14.291
Was he-was he,
um, confessing?

36:14.375 --> 36:17.208
- You know how the job is.
- 'Yeah, the job.'

36:17.291 --> 36:19.834
The job.

36:19.917 --> 36:21.375
That's always
gonna be the thing.

36:23.625 --> 36:26.417
- What does that mean?
- We all got jobs.

36:26.500 --> 36:29.542
We all don't put them ahead of
every other thing in our lives.

36:29.625 --> 36:32.750
- No. This guy left his
wife--
- And came to you.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.625
And there you were.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.542
- He was in a crisis.
- Look.

36:41.625 --> 36:42.959
Lilly.

36:45.333 --> 36:48.417
You wanna save people
at 3 in the morning, great.

36:48.500 --> 36:51.083
God bless.

36:51.166 --> 36:53.208
I know I screwed up.

36:55.417 --> 36:57.500
It's just who you are.

36:58.208 --> 36:59.625
You know and..

36:59.709 --> 37:01.917
...and I admire it.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.375
I do.

37:05.500 --> 37:07.041
But, uh..

37:11.500 --> 37:13.583
I don't wanna live like that.

37:22.417 --> 37:24.333
I'll see you, okay?

37:33.333 --> 37:34.375
Wayne's in trouble?

37:34.458 --> 37:35.917
You're both in trouble.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.667
What'd I do? I don't leave
my place. I got the gout.

37:39.750 --> 37:42.542
This dates back to when you
did leave, once in a while.

37:42.625 --> 37:43.875
(Vera)
'August, '86.'

37:43.959 --> 37:45.542
Lover's Lane.

37:47.375 --> 37:48.625
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:48.709 --> 37:50.834
The rape and murder
of Eve Kendall.

37:50.917 --> 37:52.333
Your boy's been talking.

37:52.417 --> 37:54.542
Wayne is a liar.

37:54.625 --> 37:56.333
(Valens)
'Carrie Plummer's
been talking too.'

37:56.417 --> 37:58.542
About you raping her
when she was 15.

37:58.625 --> 38:00.417
[sighs]
A lot of girls
have been around here.

38:00.500 --> 38:02.917
Anything that happened
was voluntary.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.208
- Really?
- They were cows.

38:05.291 --> 38:07.208
[laughing]
Should've thanked me.

38:07.291 --> 38:09.250
Who else was gonna
give it to 'em?

38:09.333 --> 38:10.583
You got personality
plus there, Jimbo?

38:10.667 --> 38:12.125
(Valens)
'Lay of the land, Jim.'

38:12.208 --> 38:15.208
We got sperm from
whoever raped and killed Eve.

38:15.291 --> 38:17.625
We got three bags of your beer
bottles in the hall out there.

38:17.709 --> 38:20.625
We compare DNA from your
slobber
on them bottles to the spunk?

38:20.709 --> 38:22.834
End of you being free
to sit your fat ass

38:22.917 --> 38:24.709
on that couch all day.

38:25.917 --> 38:27.875
- Where the hell is Wayne?
- Locked up.

38:27.959 --> 38:29.542
I'm gonna kill that stupid kid.

38:29.625 --> 38:31.375
Might as well give it up, Jim.

38:31.458 --> 38:33.542
Curtain's falling.

38:35.959 --> 38:37.000
Damn.

38:39.917 --> 38:41.875
They both should have died.

38:43.208 --> 38:45.792
But Wayne, he's so weak.

38:45.875 --> 38:48.083
He couldn't pull off his part.

38:49.291 --> 38:51.083
Call me disgusting?

38:53.208 --> 38:55.417
I'll show her disgusting.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.667
[panting]
Let's just go home,
dad.

38:57.750 --> 39:00.083
Oh, no.

39:00.166 --> 39:02.959
Girl thinks so much of herself?

39:03.041 --> 39:05.458
We're going to pull her
down off her high horse.

39:05.542 --> 39:08.250
'Then we're gonna
give it to her good.'

39:08.333 --> 39:11.792
Can't you just forget it?

39:11.875 --> 39:12.917
I'll meet another girl.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.250
No, no, we're getting this one.

39:19.792 --> 39:21.917
Here.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.083
'Take care of the kid.'

39:34.917 --> 39:36.875
(Eve)
'What the hell?'

39:36.959 --> 39:38.166
Remember us?

39:38.250 --> 39:41.458
You haughty little bitch?

39:41.542 --> 39:42.625
- 'Wayne?'
- Kill the kid, Wayne.

39:42.709 --> 39:43.625
Wayne, what are you doing?

39:43.709 --> 39:44.875
Take the bottle and kill him.

39:44.959 --> 39:47.417
- Come on, dad!
- Shut up!

39:47.500 --> 39:48.834
'I got the girl. Deal with him.'

39:48.917 --> 39:51.041
[Eve screaming]
'Mark! No, Wayne, no!'

39:51.125 --> 39:52.375
(Jim)
'Shut your mouth!'

39:52.458 --> 39:53.500
Kill him, Wayne.

39:53.583 --> 39:55.542
Don't you hear me?
Don't be weak!

39:55.625 --> 39:56.792
[Eve screaming]
'Mark!'

39:56.875 --> 39:59.083
[Eve crying]
No! No!
