-I wanted to put some Porsches up here.
-Hey, Mr. LaRusso, uh…

01:44.187 --> 01:45.063
I'm all done.

01:45.396 --> 01:46.231
Really?

01:48.483 --> 01:49.359
Both lots?

01:52.946 --> 01:54.030
This is bullshit.

01:54.489 --> 01:57.700
I thought you were gonna teach me karate.
I'm just doing all your shitty chores.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.539
I think you're enjoying this
a little too much.

02:06.584 --> 02:07.919
God, I love this part.

Stabilize your base, Hawk.

03:00.638 --> 03:02.932
Keep your balance.
Full rotation when you strike.

03:03.349 --> 03:04.642
Yes, Sensei. <i>Hai!</i>

03:07.687 --> 03:09.105
Did you just flinch, Virgin?

03:14.777 --> 03:16.905
Holy shit.
We got a room full of flinchers.

03:17.238 --> 03:18.281
Yes, Sensei!

03:18.364 --> 03:19.866
That was not a question!

03:20.992 --> 03:23.536
Raise your hand
if you've never been punched in the face.

03:26.456 --> 03:27.582
Put your hands down.

03:28.791 --> 03:31.085
All your lives,
you've been avoiding fights

03:32.045 --> 03:34.923
so you don't break your nose
or lose a tooth.

03:35.006 --> 03:36.966
This concussion nonsense.

03:38.676 --> 03:41.721
So, there's only one solution,
and that is before you leave this dojo,

03:41.804 --> 03:43.973
each and every of you
is gonna take a punch,

03:44.057 --> 03:46.059
very hard, to the face.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.395
Ms. Robinson, line 'em up.

-[Aisha] Come on! Next!
-What is it?

04:29.060 --> 04:31.062
-Well, there's a girl at school…
-Is she hot?

-…and she's super smart.
-Hot?

04:32.814 --> 04:34.274
-Funny and cool.
-Hot?

Yes, she's hot. Super-hot.

04:37.026 --> 04:37.902
Nice.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.780
I think you'd really like her.
She likes karate, and…

04:42.073 --> 04:43.908
I wanna ask her out,
but I just don't know.

04:43.992 --> 04:47.829
Don't know? What's there to think about?
She's hot, and all those other things.

04:47.912 --> 04:49.956
Well, yeah, but what if she says no.

04:50.373 --> 04:53.126
Never accept defeat, Diaz.
There is no "no."

04:53.459 --> 04:55.128
-Pretty sure no means no.
-[boy 5 grunts]

04:55.628 --> 04:57.422

You're a Cobra Kai.

to piss off your dad.

Look, we can't steal a car.

05:53.102 --> 05:55.396
Dude, relax. We're not gonna steal a car.

05:55.480 --> 05:59.567
We're talking about auto parts.
Like rims, stereos.

06:02.403 --> 06:04.697
-I don't know, guys.
-Dude, you don't have to do anything.

06:04.781 --> 06:07.325
Just give us the security code.
We'll let ourselves in.

06:07.408 --> 06:09.285
Yeah, but I don't have the code.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.829
I'm the new guy.
I don't even have a key to the bathroom.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.957
I'm sure you could figure something out.
You always do.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.667
Unless he doesn't want to.

06:17.585 --> 06:19.212
Oh, then we'd have a bigger problem.

06:19.295 --> 06:22.507
Yeah, remember what we did
to that bitch-ass kid over in Ventura?

06:22.799 --> 06:24.967
Oh yeah. That was unfortunate.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.219
-It was.
-Yeah.

06:26.677 --> 06:29.764
But we're not gonna have
a bigger problem, are we, Robby?

this was your locker.

-Yeah.

Anyways, uh…

06:51.619 --> 06:52.870
Glad I ran into you.

06:52.954 --> 06:55.456
Um, I've been thinking
about you a lot lately.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.252
I mean, not "a lot" a lot.
Just the normal amount

06:59.335 --> 07:01.504
that someone would think
about someone else.

07:01.587 --> 07:02.755
Are you OK?

07:03.172 --> 07:04.257
Yeah, um…

07:04.340 --> 07:05.383

Um, Miguel, that's really sweet.

I mean, I would like to.

With everything that happened with Kyler,
I'm taking a break from dating right now.

07:19.355 --> 07:21.983

07:22.066 --> 07:22.900

07:34.454 --> 07:38.040
What if it's just two people,
hanging out at the same place,

07:38.124 --> 07:41.210
having fun separately, but together.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.171
That sounds like a date.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.088
Really?

07:44.380 --> 07:45.506
It wouldn't be a date.

07:45.882 --> 07:46.924
[sighs lightly]

07:47.592 --> 07:51.012
If it's not a date, then I guess
it sounds like it could be fun.

07:51.429 --> 07:52.263
Great!

07:53.347 --> 07:54.182
What about tonight?

07:54.265 --> 07:56.058
[chuckles] Pick me up at eight.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.393
Yeah! Totally!

07:57.477 --> 07:58.311
OK.

07:58.394 --> 07:59.228
Oh…

08:00.396 --> 08:01.230
I have a bike.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.774
Uh, OK, then…

08:04.525 --> 08:05.651
I'll pick you up.

08:05.735 --> 08:06.777
[Miguel] OK, yeah.

brand-new cars right over there

that you're welcome to take photos of.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.709
[chuckles]
This is for the insurance adjuster.

08:21.792 --> 08:24.045
Instead of waiting for her
to come out here from Torrance,

08:24.128 --> 08:26.506
I'll send the photos,
and we can get to work sooner.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.549

Sure, it's Cobra Kai.

08:44.482 --> 08:46.275
Cobra, like the badass snake.

08:47.109 --> 08:49.612
I need somewhere romantic,
but not too romantic.

and astronomy.

-I could work with that.
-[Johnny] Banned?

09:33.531 --> 09:34.907
What are you talking about?

09:38.244 --> 09:39.620
No, you don't ban me.

09:39.704 --> 09:40.955
I'll ban you!

09:42.873 --> 09:44.333
Sensei, what's going on?

09:44.667 --> 09:47.795
There's a lifetime ban on Cobra Kai
from entering the tournament.

09:47.878 --> 09:50.006
What? How is that fair?

09:50.089 --> 09:51.090
It's not.

09:52.550 --> 09:53.884
There's nothing I can do about it.

09:53.968 --> 09:56.304
What happened to "never accept defeat?"

09:56.387 --> 09:57.638
There is no "no"?

09:57.722 --> 09:59.765
That was girl advice. This is different.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.809
This is the real world.
There are rules.

10:01.892 --> 10:03.894
Since when do you care about the rules?

10:04.353 --> 10:07.982
"We don't take no for an answer,"
you said that! You gotta fight this.

10:10.359 --> 10:12.236
You know what? You're right.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.655
-I'm gonna go down there…
-Yeah.

10:14.739 --> 10:17.158
-…and beat their asses.
-Yeah. No, no, no!

10:17.241 --> 10:18.576
What? No, that's not what I meant.

10:18.659 --> 10:22.455
I'm saying maybe
there's a more delicate approach, Sensei?

10:23.247 --> 10:25.082
The way of the fist is not delicate.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.335
Cobras are not delicate.

10:27.418 --> 10:29.337
Yes, yes, sorry. I… Forget delicate.

10:29.754 --> 10:30.755
I'm just saying,

10:31.714 --> 10:33.883
maybe there's a smarter way to fight back?

10:39.347 --> 10:42.683
Hey, have you seen Robby?
I could use some help with those filters.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.019
Yeah, he's in the back.
He's helping me trim the bonsais.

10:45.102 --> 10:46.479
Oh, wow.

10:46.562 --> 10:48.898
You're letting him
touch your precious bonsais.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.566
That's like third base for you, babe.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.069
He's a good kid.
He's just had a rough go of it,

10:53.152 --> 10:56.113
and I thought if I could
teach him a few things, you know…

10:56.489 --> 11:00.076
Well, just don't try to lure him
into opening his own bonsai tree store.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.952
-You know how that goes.
-No, no, no.

11:02.036 --> 11:04.497
Mr. Miyagi's Little Trees
was a solid business plan.

11:04.580 --> 11:07.667
We just ran into some bad luck, OK?
Never again.

11:07.750 --> 11:08.751
Never again.

[Daniel] How's it going?

11:20.346 --> 11:22.139
I'm sorry, I suck at this.

11:22.973 --> 11:25.643
I don't know what I'm doing. I just…
I don't get it.

11:25.726 --> 11:26.644
Don't worry.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.813
I didn't get it either at first.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.023
Mr. Miyagi had to teach me.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.234
Mr. Miyagi.

11:33.317 --> 11:35.444
That's the dude
who taught you kata, right?

11:36.153 --> 11:37.613
Yeah. He was a…

11:38.406 --> 11:39.990
pretty special dude.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.409
He taught me a lot.

11:44.578 --> 11:46.747
And what you've gotta do
is close your eyes,

11:47.665 --> 11:49.291
get everything out of your head.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.336
The only thing you can see is the tree.

11:54.296 --> 11:55.798
Think only the tree.

11:57.591 --> 12:01.303
Then you visualize

some kind of metaphor.

The tree's, like,
my feelings or something.

Well, you are the tree, Robby.

You know who you are, right?

what you want your future to look like,

If you get pissed off,
what are you gonna do?

I don't know.
I usually just punch the guy.

But my Cobra Kai is different.

and feel like they belong.

Where they won't get picked on
just because they're losers.

22:42.444 --> 22:43.695
Because they're unique.

Cobra Kai is making a difference
in these kids' lives.

in mine as well.

in my high school,

23:30.325 --> 23:31.618
[man] I'm sorry, Mr. Lawrence.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.538
I don't know you,
but I do know Daniel LaRusso,

23:34.621 --> 23:37.165
and if he says no, I'm with him.

23:37.749 --> 23:38.834
Thank you, George.

23:38.917 --> 23:39.918
[gavel pounds]

23:41.378 --> 23:44.506
Seems the only fair solution
is to put this to a vote.

23:44.589 --> 23:45.841
-[Sue] Mm-hmm.
-[George] Right.

23:45.924 --> 23:49.261
Mr. Lawrence, would you mind
waiting outside while we cast our ballots?

23:51.138 --> 23:52.139
Not at all.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.768
Thank you all
for your careful consideration.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.353
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.272
Just wait outside, all right?

24:00.355 --> 24:02.149
[sighs deeply]

24:03.066 --> 24:05.861
OK, guys, this sob story…
I mean, you were not there.

24:05.944 --> 24:07.404
-So…
-Mm-hmm?

24:08.655 --> 24:12.159
Señor Octopus would like to know
if you are better at karate…

24:12.242 --> 24:13.910
-Karate.
-…than you are at mini-golf.

24:13.994 --> 24:14.828
Hmm!

24:14.911 --> 24:17.247
OK, I didn't realize
the octopus was Hispanic now,

24:17.330 --> 24:19.875
but, uh, why don't you tell Señor Octopus

24:19.958 --> 24:23.336
that, um, my sensei says
I'm the best student in his class.

24:23.712 --> 24:25.464
-Really? Best in his class?
-Yeah.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.093
You don't believe me? No way…

24:30.177 --> 24:32.512
-No, no, no.
-I mean… I didn't say that.

24:32.596 --> 24:33.472
Stand up.

24:34.514 --> 24:36.766
-OK.
-All right, here's what we're gonna do.

24:36.850 --> 24:37.684
[Samantha] Mm-hmm.

24:37.767 --> 24:39.603
Get into like a general fighting position.

24:39.686 --> 24:41.897
Just… Yeah, leg out,
kind of like in an L.

24:41.980 --> 24:42.939
Arm out here.

24:43.023 --> 24:44.524
Then you want that arm out.

24:44.608 --> 24:45.817
-Uh-huh.
-There you go.

24:45.901 --> 24:47.402
Then you kind of position…

24:47.486 --> 24:49.988
You wanna put your hands on my hips?

24:50.614 --> 24:53.909
Uh, no. I'm correcting your stance.
Look, this move is really hard,

24:53.992 --> 24:56.244
so if you don't get it on the first time,
don't feel bad--

24:56.328 --> 24:57.329
[Miguel grunts]

24:57.412 --> 24:59.122
-[Miguel panting]
-[laughs]

24:59.206 --> 25:01.541
Holy shit, Sam. That was amazing.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.585
What are you-- [grunts]

25:03.668 --> 25:04.878
Sensei Sam.

25:09.466 --> 25:11.885
You know, this may be the best date
I've ever been on.

25:11.968 --> 25:14.387
Really?
Because technically, this isn't a date.

25:14.471 --> 25:15.305
Right.

25:15.972 --> 25:17.057
Not a date.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.984
And that was not a kiss.

25:29.778 --> 25:31.196
-Yeah.
-[Sam giggles]

25:33.406 --> 25:35.033
[muffled arguing through door]

25:36.743 --> 25:37.869
[door opens]

25:40.580 --> 25:41.998
Congratulations, Johnny.

26:07.357 --> 26:09.067
[whispered exclamations]

26:09.150 --> 26:12.737
-Ooh! Who's the man?
-I'm the man.

26:13.780 --> 26:15.490
Oh shit. Are you the man too?

26:16.408 --> 26:18.243
-Tell me you're the man.
-I'm the man!

26:18.326 --> 26:19.452
-Yeah!
-I crushed the date.

26:19.536 --> 26:22.289
-I crushed the committee meeting.
-So, Cobra Kai's in?

26:22.372 --> 26:24.874
Hell, yeah, we're in.
Cobra Kai's back, baby.

26:26.459 --> 26:28.753
All right, I'm gonna grab a soda.
Do you want a Banquet?

26:28.837 --> 26:31.006
No, no. This calls for a real toast.

26:38.388 --> 26:39.306
Oh.

26:39.389 --> 26:41.016
The good stuff, for real men.

26:44.936 --> 26:46.229
[sniffs] Ugh!

26:46.313 --> 26:48.356
Drink it. It'll put hair on your balls.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.692
-Is that a good thing?
-Yeah, it's a good thing.

26:50.775 --> 26:52.444
OK. [breathes deeply]

26:52.527 --> 26:53.653
To Cobra Kai!

26:54.112 --> 26:55.447
Never accept defeat.

27:00.243 --> 27:01.411
[Johnny] Ah!

27:13.173 --> 27:14.716
