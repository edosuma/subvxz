00:18.999 --> 00:20.999
Getting on a yacht
with five new crew members

00:20.999 --> 00:22.999
is like getting in a car

You don't know who's going
to lose their minds,

00:27.999 --> 00:30.999
Bahamas is such

00:30.999 --> 00:32.999
We got a new crew,
new boat that I had to learn.

00:32.999 --> 00:34.999
I explained to him
about this.

00:34.999 --> 00:36.999
I need my crew to respect me.

Hey! Higher!

Crazy ideas, I know.

I really hope
that Captain Lee's

00:49.999 --> 00:52.999
brought in
some, like, handsome men.

I was a platform/springboard

I became a ski instructor
and then a surf guide.

my house was really

08:00.999 --> 08:01.999
a toxic environment,

08:01.999 --> 08:04.999

to go out and see the world.

08:47.999 --> 08:49.999
The female cooks, cleans...

08:49.999 --> 08:53.999
Okay, and what does
the male do--fish?

08:53.999 --> 08:55.999
No.

08:55.999 --> 08:56.999
- Well, a female gets the food.
- Okay.

08:56.999 --> 09:00.999
The males just fight.
Who gets the females?

09:00.999 --> 09:02.999
I'm gonna be scared now
when I have food around me.

09:02.999 --> 09:06.999
Emile is so cute,
but he's got no game.

09:06.999 --> 09:10.999
Don't lions mate
like dogs?

09:10.999 --> 09:12.999
Imagine having
a lion behind me.

09:12.999 --> 09:13.999
It'd be like
having a linebacker.

09:13.999 --> 09:15.999
Actually, that probably wouldn't
be a bad idea.

09:15.999 --> 09:16.999
If a guy wants
to get my attention,

09:16.999 --> 09:18.999
there's a couple lines
that will get me.

09:18.999 --> 09:22.999
"Get in my truck."
"Do you want a beer?"

09:22.999 --> 09:23.999
"Do you want to go fishing?"

09:23.999 --> 09:25.999
"Let's go kill a gator."

09:25.999 --> 09:28.999
Say that, and, whoop,
there goes Connie's clothes.

09:28.999 --> 09:30.999
Any kind of football player
that just wants

09:30.999 --> 09:34.999
to grab me from behind
and throw me around.

09:34.999 --> 09:37.999
[both laughing]

09:37.999 --> 09:38.999
(Kate)
Provisions are here.
All crew, all crew.

09:38.999 --> 09:40.999
(woman)
Copy.

09:40.999 --> 09:42.999
- Buddy, how you doing?
- You good with that?

09:42.999 --> 09:43.999
If you want to stay in here
and unload...

09:43.999 --> 09:45.999
Oh, look,
here's muscles just in time.

09:45.999 --> 09:48.999
Coming on to a boat,
and less than 24 hours later,

09:48.999 --> 09:50.999
we're bringing on
charter guests.

09:50.999 --> 09:52.999
It's very hard work,
but I think it's going

09:52.999 --> 09:56.999
to be a great test
for how our crew runs as a team.

09:58.999 --> 09:59.999
[moans]

09:59.999 --> 10:01.999
First thing
tomorrow morning,

10:01.999 --> 10:02.999
we're gonna get
those tender off,
get the chocks off.

10:02.999 --> 10:05.999
We also need to clean
the head on the tender.

10:05.999 --> 10:06.999
I really don't mind
deckhand work at all,

10:06.999 --> 10:07.999
but I came on this boat
for my skill set

10:07.999 --> 10:09.999
in the engine room,
not my deckhand skills.

10:09.999 --> 10:11.999
When there's no guests
and we're, like,
washing the boat down.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.999
I'll wear, like,
my bathing suit

10:13.999 --> 10:15.999
and then an			 Eros T-shirt.

10:15.999 --> 10:17.999
So I can't clean
in my tutu?

10:17.999 --> 10:18.999
You can clean in a tutu.
That's fine.

10:18.999 --> 10:20.999
You can do it
in a bikini, yeah.

10:20.999 --> 10:22.999
Probably not a good idea.

10:25.999 --> 10:28.999
How long have you been cooking
on yachts?

10:28.999 --> 10:32.999
I'm back
in the yachting industry

10:32.999 --> 10:34.999
I have two amazing daughters
who are my world.

10:34.999 --> 10:36.999
So the whole idea
of getting back into yachting

10:36.999 --> 10:38.999
is to try and provide for them
and give them an amazing life,

10:38.999 --> 10:40.999
but, in the same breath,
feeds me,

10:40.999 --> 10:41.999
as in what I want to be

10:41.999 --> 10:44.999
and where I want to put myself
later on in life as well.

10:44.999 --> 10:46.000
So what are you doing?
Are you gonna be...?

10:46.000 --> 10:49.999
I am, like,
your helper/the girls' helper.

10:49.999 --> 10:51.000
Right.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.999
Yeah, and then
I'll help you out.

10:52.999 --> 10:54.000
How long have you been working
on yachts?

10:54.999 --> 10:55.999
Six months.

10:55.999 --> 10:56.999
I mean, if you want
something to do,

10:56.999 --> 10:59.999
I'm just going
to find some soap.

10:59.999 --> 11:01.000
[coughs]
I'm gonna check in
with the girls...

11:01.000 --> 11:02.999
- Okay, check in with the girls.
- And see what's up.

11:02.999 --> 11:04.999
(Kate)
We're gonna have an interior
meeting down here, guys.

11:04.999 --> 11:06.999
I'm sorry. Go, like, tie knots
or something.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.000
[laughter]

11:08.999 --> 11:09.999
That was kind of funny.

11:09.999 --> 11:11.999
I was gonna, like,
offer to help, like, cook

11:11.999 --> 11:13.999
for crew and stuff,
you know.

11:13.999 --> 11:16.999
Yeah, you can do that when we
don't have guests on board,

11:16.999 --> 11:18.999
but I just can't lose...

11:18.999 --> 11:20.999
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- A stew, yeah.

11:20.999 --> 11:21.999
- Cool.
- I hope you don't mind.

11:21.999 --> 11:22.999
- No.

11:22.999 --> 11:25.999
What exactly
is your experience?

11:25.999 --> 11:27.999
I've never just been
just a stew.

11:27.999 --> 11:29.000
Mainly is, like, cooking,
and so--

11:29.999 --> 11:30.999
And then it's like,
"Oh, clean up after everyone."

11:30.999 --> 11:32.999
I'm like, "Okay,"
and so, like, I've done it,

11:32.999 --> 11:36.999
but I haven't, like, done it
to the extent of, like...

11:36.999 --> 11:37.999
"Yo, this is your job."

11:38.000 --> 11:39.999
Okay, great.

11:39.999 --> 11:40.999
I'm gonna do
stewardess-ing 100%.

11:40.999 --> 11:42.999
I'm not gonna, like,
kind of do it.

11:42.999 --> 11:44.000
I'm gonna do it.

11:44.999 --> 11:47.999
So there's an opportunity here
for me to learn new skills,

11:47.999 --> 11:49.999
but, no, this is not
what I want to be

11:49.999 --> 11:51.999
when I grow up.

11:51.999 --> 11:53.999
Anything that we're doing,
like, Kate and I can show you.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.999
It's not rocket science.

11:55.999 --> 11:56.999
Well...

11:56.999 --> 11:58.999
So I have checklists
for everything.

11:58.999 --> 12:00.999
Beauty of the list is
there's no confusion--

12:00.999 --> 12:01.999
like, "I didn't know I had
to do it."

12:01.999 --> 12:03.999
I'll be like,
"Well, it was on the list."

12:03.999 --> 12:04.999
Yeah, what's
your favorite department?

12:04.999 --> 12:06.999
- Service.
- Okay.

12:06.999 --> 12:07.999
What's your least favorite?

12:07.999 --> 12:09.999
I don't have a ton
of experience, like, ironing

12:09.999 --> 12:11.999
and doing laundry.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.999
This is a giant red flag
for me,

12:13.999 --> 12:17.999
because every stewardess
loves the laundry room.

12:17.999 --> 12:19.999
- It's good. It's good.
- It is good.

12:19.999 --> 12:20.999
You're not waiting
on guests--

12:20.999 --> 12:22.999
just you and the machines
and peace and quiet.

12:22.999 --> 12:24.999
What's not to love?

12:24.999 --> 12:25.999
I like outside.
[giggles]

12:25.999 --> 12:27.999
So now you're a stew,
cook, deckhand?

12:27.999 --> 12:29.999
You're like
a Swiss Army Knife.

12:29.999 --> 12:30.999
Thank you,
I feel like you care.

12:30.999 --> 12:32.999
- Aw, it worked.
[laughter]

12:35.999 --> 12:38.999
Mr. Bradley
wants a foam party.

12:38.999 --> 12:40.999
[screaming]

12:40.999 --> 12:43.999
[men shouting indistinctly]

12:46.999 --> 12:48.999
When you're working the deck,
I am your boss.

12:54.999 --> 12:58.999
I need everybody in
the Sky Lounge in two minutes.

13:03.999 --> 13:04.999
Yeah.

13:06.999 --> 13:08.999
(Lee)
Okay, let's get started.

13:08.999 --> 13:11.999
I'm generally not difficult
to get along with,

13:11.999 --> 13:13.999
as long as everybody
does their job.

13:13.999 --> 13:15.999
It's our
new incentive program.

13:15.999 --> 13:17.999
It's called,
"Work hard or get fired."

13:17.999 --> 13:19.999
Some of the other crew
may tell you that I walk around

13:19.999 --> 13:21.999
with a pocket full
of plane tickets...

13:21.999 --> 13:23.999
There's a little something extra
in that pay envelope,

13:23.999 --> 13:25.999
and it's a one-way ticket.

13:25.999 --> 13:26.999
Which brings us to tips.

13:26.999 --> 13:28.999
Everybody gets an equal share
of the tips.

13:28.999 --> 13:31.999
If you don't deserve
an equal share of the tip,

13:31.999 --> 13:33.999
you still get an equal share,

13:33.999 --> 13:36.999
but you also get
the plane ticket.

13:36.999 --> 13:40.999
Our first officer, Dan.
chief engineer, Richard.

13:40.999 --> 13:43.999
If they ask you to do something,
just do it.

13:43.999 --> 13:47.999
Drinking on charter.
We don't.

13:47.999 --> 13:49.000
Three rules--
Work hard.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.999
Don't embarrass yourself.
Don't embarrass the boat.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.000
Being on this boat,
it's gonna be tough,

13:55.000 --> 13:56.999
but, you know, I kind of knew

13:56.999 --> 13:58.999
what I was getting
myself into a little bit,

13:59.000 --> 14:01.999
and I'm super excited

14:01.999 --> 14:03.999
to be working
under Captain Lee,

14:03.999 --> 14:06.999
because there's not gonna be
any, like, sexual tension there

14:06.999 --> 14:09.999
and I can just do my job
and have fun.

14:09.999 --> 14:12.999
(Lee)
Let's make this a really,
really, really great season,

14:12.999 --> 14:13.999
all right?

14:13.999 --> 14:14.999
- Yeah.
- Sounds good.

14:14.999 --> 14:15.999
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

14:15.999 --> 14:17.999
(Kate)
Time to rock and roll.

14:19.999 --> 14:21.999
This is all we have
to eat right now?

14:21.999 --> 14:22.999
So hungry.

14:22.999 --> 14:24.999
How old are you guys?

14:24.999 --> 14:25.999
27.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.999
I'm 30 years old.

14:27.999 --> 14:29.999
Liar.
You're 20.

14:29.999 --> 14:31.999
- 22, 23.
- 23, 23.

14:31.999 --> 14:33.999
- 23.
- I'm, like, the youngest here.

14:33.999 --> 14:34.999
- I realize that.
- That's good!

14:34.999 --> 14:35.999
Emile's beautiful.

14:35.999 --> 14:38.999
His eyes are just like,
"Hey, baby,

14:38.999 --> 14:39.999
you want to come
to my cabin."

14:39.999 --> 14:42.999
And I'm like, "Yes, I want
to come to your cabin."

14:42.999 --> 14:45.999
- How old are you?
- How old do you think I am?

14:45.999 --> 14:46.999
Ugh, ugh.

14:46.999 --> 14:47.999
After that.

14:47.999 --> 14:49.999
- [laughs] 10.
- Definitely.

14:49.999 --> 14:51.999
- 13, 14...
- You are definitely 20...

14:51.999 --> 14:53.999
15, 16, 17, 18, 19...

14:53.999 --> 14:56.999
23, 24.
Yeah, 24, come on.

14:56.999 --> 14:58.999
I think the coffee
just hit me!

14:58.999 --> 15:01.999
By the way, I like my coffee
like I like my women.

15:01.999 --> 15:02.999
- Black?
- Black?

15:02.999 --> 15:04.999
No, blonde
with low self-esteem.

15:04.999 --> 15:06.999
[laughs]

15:06.999 --> 15:08.999
(Don)
Stupid.

15:08.999 --> 15:12.999
I need Eddie, Kate...

15:12.999 --> 15:14.999
and Chef up in the bridge.

15:14.999 --> 15:17.000
- Hey.
- Hi, sweetie.

15:17.999 --> 15:19.999
So let's start
with Mr. Bradley

15:19.999 --> 15:20.999
and look at the rest
of his guests.

15:20.999 --> 15:24.999
Steve owns a lot
of luxury properties in Mexico.

15:24.999 --> 15:25.999
Relationship--
he's the boss.

15:25.999 --> 15:27.999
So I don't know if these are,
like, their friends,

15:27.999 --> 15:30.999
but it sounds like
they may be employees as well.

15:30.999 --> 15:31.999
I don't know.

15:31.999 --> 15:32.999
We got
a Mexican-themed dinner.

15:32.999 --> 15:33.999
La vida loca.

15:33.999 --> 15:35.999
Heavy on the champagne
on this guy.

15:35.999 --> 15:36.999
That's easy, right?

15:36.999 --> 15:38.999
- It is easy.
- No mojitos.

15:38.999 --> 15:41.999
I don't think so,
although I'm open.

15:41.999 --> 15:43.999
I ordered mint.
You have any basil?

15:43.999 --> 15:44.999
No basil.
Can you believe it?

15:44.999 --> 15:46.999
I'll do a Mexican
with coriander.

15:46.999 --> 15:47.999
Exactly.

15:47.999 --> 15:48.999
"Improvisation"--that's the word
we're looking for.

15:48.999 --> 15:49.999
I agree.

15:49.999 --> 15:51.999
A white-robe dinner party.

15:51.999 --> 15:53.999
And then they want
a foam party

15:53.999 --> 15:55.999
with blinky-light props.

15:55.999 --> 15:57.999
Oh, it's a rave,
I guess.

15:57.999 --> 16:01.999
How many raves
have you been to?

16:01.999 --> 16:02.999
This could be your first?

16:02.999 --> 16:05.999
I've never heard of any yacht
ever having a foam party.

16:05.999 --> 16:08.999
Foam parties should probably
just stay where they belong--

16:08.999 --> 16:09.999
in 1997.

16:09.999 --> 16:11.000
- Let's have some fun.
- Okay?

16:11.000 --> 16:12.999
- I'm excited.
- Thank you.

16:12.999 --> 16:14.999
(Lee)
All right, thank you, guys.

16:16.999 --> 16:18.999
Oh, by the way,
I just don't want

16:18.999 --> 16:23.999
you or Raquel
to be under the impression

16:23.999 --> 16:25.999
that she is the stew cook
on this boat.

16:25.999 --> 16:27.999
She might try to help you out

16:27.999 --> 16:30.999
more than I can afford
to let her help you out.

16:30.999 --> 16:32.999
We'll see. I mean, we'll cross
that bridge when we get there.

16:32.999 --> 16:34.999
Kate--she speaks her mind.
She doesn't hold anything back.

16:34.999 --> 16:36.999
At the same time,
Kate doesn't really know me.

16:36.999 --> 16:40.999
I run my galley.
She runs the pantry.

16:40.999 --> 16:44.999
[sighs]

16:44.999 --> 16:47.999
I didn't realize that we were
jumping straight, straight,

16:47.999 --> 16:48.999
straight into it, you know?

16:48.999 --> 16:49.999
(Amy)
Right.

16:49.999 --> 16:51.999
Like, it starts tomorrow.

16:51.999 --> 16:53.000
You know what I'm not used to,
to be honest with you?

16:53.999 --> 16:54.999
When I'm engineering a boat,
I do my thing.

16:54.999 --> 16:57.000
I fix myself.
I work my ass off.

16:57.999 --> 16:59.999
I don't have to deal with
being on the deck and--

16:59.999 --> 17:00.999
And I like it. I'll help
you guys no matter what.

17:00.999 --> 17:03.999
I'll do the best I can,
but I'm kind of dabbling

17:03.999 --> 17:04.999
into a forte that
I'm not really--

17:05.000 --> 17:06.999
I haven't been into
that long, you know?

17:06.999 --> 17:08.999
Before I actually came
on this boat,

17:08.999 --> 17:09.999
I had the whole diagram
for the boat,

17:09.999 --> 17:11.999
and I studied it for a month,

17:11.999 --> 17:13.999
to know where the breakers are,
to know where the trips are,

17:13.999 --> 17:14.999
to know exactly where
every single system is,

17:14.999 --> 17:16.999
even how the plumbing
is rooted.

17:16.999 --> 17:18.999
So, for me,
everything was passion-based.

17:18.999 --> 17:20.999
If I'm not 100% passionate
about it, I don't do it.

17:33.999 --> 17:36.999
I'm gonna go to bed.
[giggles]

17:36.999 --> 17:38.999
- Are you ready for me?
- No.

17:38.999 --> 17:41.999
Through my wisdom
and experience,

17:41.999 --> 17:44.999
it's not the best thing
to hook up with your bunkmate.

17:44.999 --> 17:48.999
I won't do it again.
I won't jeopardize--

17:48.999 --> 17:50.999
I mean, yeah, it depends
if I'm drunk.

17:50.999 --> 17:54.999
[laughing]

18:02.999 --> 18:05.999
I'm so happy everyone
is so cool.

18:05.999 --> 18:10.999
I thought everyone
was gonna be, like, crazy.

18:10.999 --> 18:14.999
[laughing]

18:14.999 --> 18:16.999
- Oh, fááá.
- [laughing]

18:16.999 --> 18:18.999
Oh, fááá.
She's fáááing nuts.

18:18.999 --> 18:20.999
We are in fáááing trouble,
aren't we?

18:21.000 --> 18:24.999
I just feel like, for crew,
this kind of bed-setting

18:24.999 --> 18:26.999
is almost
a little more awkward.

18:26.999 --> 18:28.999
(Kate)
Usually you have a top bunk
and a bottom bunk,

18:28.999 --> 18:31.999
and I like the separation
of space--

18:31.999 --> 18:34.999
up and down, own worlds.

18:34.999 --> 18:35.999
Eh...

18:35.999 --> 18:38.999
It's just too close.

18:38.999 --> 18:41.999
I don't think there's anybody
that I would like to fall asleep

18:41.999 --> 18:42.999
this close to every night.

18:42.999 --> 18:45.999
It's like I'm in an ashram
on a cot.

18:52.999 --> 18:53.999
Yes, hello.

18:53.999 --> 18:56.999
I was wondering if I could rent
a foam machine.

18:57.999 --> 18:59.999
All right, Chef,
it's all set.

18:59.999 --> 19:01.999
The guys have
the most fun job.

19:01.999 --> 19:02.999
There, like, hanging off
the side of the boat.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.999
(Kate)
I don't think it's as fun
as it looks.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.999
I want to be outside.
I would love to be Eddie.

19:07.999 --> 19:09.999
But then again,
I wouldn't want to be Eddie.

19:09.999 --> 19:12.999
It's like, where does Raquel fit
on the boat?

19:12.999 --> 19:14.999
I really hate
that I'm saying this right now,

19:14.999 --> 19:16.000
but you definitely missed
a spot.

19:16.999 --> 19:17.999
Okay.

19:22.999 --> 19:24.999
(Amy)
Look at this.
I mean, this is huge.

19:24.999 --> 19:26.999
I've never seen, like,
a split-level master.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.999
If you want to go around
and just mark down

19:29.999 --> 19:33.999
if you see anything broken,
weird, cool...

19:33.999 --> 19:34.999
Okay.

19:34.999 --> 19:36.999
Because, Rocky--
you're the more experienced,

19:36.999 --> 19:39.999
obviously, so I need
to count on you.

19:39.999 --> 19:40.999
- Yeah.
- I know you can do it.

19:40.999 --> 19:42.999
I know that we both
have the same end goal--

19:42.999 --> 19:44.999
to have a good time
and to have good charters.

19:44.999 --> 19:46.999
- Right.
- Happy charter guests.

19:46.999 --> 19:47.999
I know things
ended a little bit awkward.

19:47.999 --> 19:49.999
I just want to be a really good
second stew for you.

19:49.999 --> 19:52.999
I know you will, and I'm
so thankful to have you here.

19:52.999 --> 19:54.999
Are we really going to be
on the same page?

19:54.999 --> 19:56.999
Is she really meaning this,

19:56.999 --> 19:59.999
or is she saying this
and not feeling it?

19:59.999 --> 20:01.999
Not sure what I'm up against.

20:01.999 --> 20:03.999
The art on this boat
is weird.

20:05.999 --> 20:07.999
Five minutes, people.
Let's go.

20:07.999 --> 20:09.999
Hey, are we supposed to be
wearing ties with our whites?

20:09.999 --> 20:11.999
Negative.

20:14.999 --> 20:16.999
So the rooms look ready
and good?

20:16.999 --> 20:17.999
- Yeah.
- Okay.

20:17.999 --> 20:19.999
I need everybody
on the aft deck now.

20:19.999 --> 20:22.999
The guests are starting
to get down the dock.

20:22.999 --> 20:24.999
(man)
Look at that beautiful ship.

20:24.999 --> 20:27.000
It's all ours
for fun in the sun!

20:28.999 --> 20:29.999
Here we go.

20:37.999 --> 20:40.000
- Crew on the mast?
- Oh, my God.

20:40.999 --> 20:44.999
I've never heard
of anything like this ever,

20:44.999 --> 20:46.999
'cause that's how
stupid it is.

20:52.999 --> 20:53.999
(Rocky)
They look happy.

20:55.999 --> 20:57.999
- How you doing?
- Great!

20:57.999 --> 20:58.999
Steve, come on up.

20:58.999 --> 21:00.999
This is Jennifer,
my girlfriend.

21:00.999 --> 21:01.999
- Jennifer. Captain Lee.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

21:01.999 --> 21:03.999
- I'm Steven Bradley.
- Steven, my pleasure.

21:03.999 --> 21:04.999
Pleasure, Captain.

21:04.999 --> 21:06.999
Amy!
Nice to meet you.

21:06.999 --> 21:09.999
Hey! Charter one,
here we go.

21:09.999 --> 21:11.999
Hi, there, Steve.
Leon.

21:11.999 --> 21:13.999
- Hey, Leon. Chef Leon?
- Chef Leon.

21:13.999 --> 21:15.999
I had a Chef Leon
in the Bahamas

21:15.999 --> 21:17.999
on a billionaire's island
before.

21:17.999 --> 21:18.999
- Right, right, right.
- All right.

21:18.999 --> 21:20.999
This is gonna make it
real easy.

21:20.999 --> 21:22.999
(Kate)
When I'm meeting new guests,
I want to assume the best.

21:22.999 --> 21:24.999
Maybe they're high-maintenance,

21:24.999 --> 21:27.999
but there's different levels
of high-maintenance.

21:27.999 --> 21:29.999
I mean, you can love champagne,
but that's easy to pour.

21:29.999 --> 21:33.999
(all)
Hey!

21:33.999 --> 21:35.999
Did you hear that Aerosmith
might be around town?

21:35.999 --> 21:37.999
I did hear that.

21:37.999 --> 21:38.999
If there's any way
we can put the radar up

21:38.999 --> 21:41.999
and try to find 'em,
that would be really good.

21:41.999 --> 21:45.999
Now, I can pull off
almost any guest request,

21:45.999 --> 21:47.999
but Aerosmith...

21:47.999 --> 21:48.999
It's, like, so vintage.

21:48.999 --> 21:51.999
It's 1990s.

21:51.999 --> 21:52.999
I don't get it.

21:52.999 --> 21:54.999
Kate is gonna get you guys
all settled in,

21:54.999 --> 21:56.999
give you a tour of the boat,
and then we'll get under way.

21:56.999 --> 21:58.000
Let's rock and roll.

21:58.999 --> 21:59.999
Right this way, guys.

21:59.999 --> 22:01.999
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

22:01.999 --> 22:03.000
Guys, let's go ahead and get
the luggage--load 'em up.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.999
- So this is the main salon.
- Wow, beautiful.

22:06.999 --> 22:09.999
Absolutely gorgeous.

22:09.999 --> 22:12.999
(Kate)
This is one state room,
and we have three like this.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.000
(Steve)
Beautiful,
absolutely beautiful.

22:17.999 --> 22:20.999
(Steve)
Honey, we're home!
[laughing]

22:24.999 --> 22:26.999
Steve looks wild.
He looks crazy.

22:26.999 --> 22:28.999
I hope I have that much energy
when I'm 58.

22:28.999 --> 22:31.999
[Steve laughs]

22:31.999 --> 22:33.999
(Jennifer)
This is gorgeous.

22:33.999 --> 22:35.999
(Steve)
Man!

22:35.999 --> 22:37.999
So, if you want
to watch a movie...

22:37.999 --> 22:38.999
- Uh-huh.
- You can close the blinds.

22:38.999 --> 22:40.999
(Steve)
Oh, yeah.

22:40.999 --> 22:42.999
Bow man's gonna be up there,
and we're gonna be, you know,

22:42.999 --> 22:45.000
getting frisky.
[chuckles]

22:48.999 --> 22:50.999
We're gonna go up
straight to the Sky Lounge,

22:50.999 --> 22:54.999
where I think you'll spend
more of your time.

22:54.999 --> 22:56.999
- Wow.
- Wow.

22:56.999 --> 22:59.999
(woman)
It's amazing.

22:59.999 --> 23:01.999
So we'll be serving
breakfast, lunch, and dinner

23:01.999 --> 23:03.999
- here for the most part.
- Ooh, wow!

23:03.999 --> 23:05.999
(Kate)
Now we're gonna go up
this spiral staircase,

23:05.999 --> 23:07.000
if you want to go ahead.

23:07.999 --> 23:08.999
(Steve)
Home, sweet home right here.

23:08.999 --> 23:12.999
Wow, the Jacuzzi!
The pot is hot!

23:12.999 --> 23:13.999
- Beautiful.
- Great.

23:13.999 --> 23:15.999
(woman)
Look at the view.
It's amazing.

23:15.999 --> 23:16.999
(man)
Beautiful.

23:16.999 --> 23:18.999
(Lee)
Attention all crew.
Attention all crew.

23:18.999 --> 23:19.999
We're getting under way.

23:19.999 --> 23:20.999
All right, Don,
you're on the bow.

23:20.999 --> 23:22.999
Emile, you're on the side.

23:22.999 --> 23:25.999
Now, would you all like us
to unpack you?

23:25.999 --> 23:26.999
No, thank you.

23:26.999 --> 23:28.999
Getting out of here
once Captain orders it.

23:28.999 --> 23:31.999
- Copy that.
- From the bow.

23:33.999 --> 23:34.999
(Lee)
That stern line
is the critical one.

23:34.999 --> 23:38.999
It's got to come off
as fast as it can.

23:38.999 --> 23:40.999
(Steve)
Well, we're moving.
It's shallow.

23:40.999 --> 23:42.999
- Look at this sand.
- This is so awesome.

23:42.999 --> 23:44.999
Would you like
some more champagne?

23:44.999 --> 23:46.999
- A little.
- Okay.

23:46.999 --> 23:48.999
Give me "gistics"
off that starboard side.

23:48.999 --> 23:51.999
(Eddie)
50 feet off the jetty.

23:58.999 --> 24:00.999
(Steve)
Aerosmith!

24:00.999 --> 24:02.999
I'm sure Aerosmith
would want to come.

24:02.999 --> 24:03.999
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

24:03.999 --> 24:05.999
- Why wouldn't he?
- I have--

24:05.999 --> 24:06.999
That's what I'm saying.

24:10.999 --> 24:12.999
(Leon)
Salads are good to go.

24:15.999 --> 24:16.999
Oh, my God.

24:16.999 --> 24:19.999
(Kate)
We're gonna go
and move on to lunch.

24:24.999 --> 24:27.999
That looks so beautiful.

24:27.999 --> 24:29.999
One of the major things
on a charter is the food.

24:29.999 --> 24:31.999
It's not the toys.

24:31.999 --> 24:32.999
It's not
where you're taking 'em.

24:32.999 --> 24:34.000
It's the be-all and end-all.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.999
You serve bad food,

24:35.999 --> 24:39.999
I guarantee
you're gonna get bad tips.

24:39.999 --> 24:41.999
This chicken is phenomenal.

24:41.999 --> 24:43.000
(Steve)
You guys have all been
to the mansion.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.999
You know that we have
a chef there,

24:44.999 --> 24:48.999
but she's not as creative
as Chef Leon is, for sure.

24:48.999 --> 24:50.999
(Leon)
Everything okay, Kate?

24:50.999 --> 24:51.999
Everything's great.
It looks so beautiful.

24:51.999 --> 24:55.999
And if there's some left,
I would love to try it.

24:55.999 --> 24:57.999
(Steve)
Fantastic.

25:03.999 --> 25:05.000
I had, like, two bites.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.999
I reckon, before you leave
this place, right,

25:07.000 --> 25:08.999
you'll put weight on.

25:08.999 --> 25:11.999
Well, thanks. I'm just standing
around all this food.

25:11.999 --> 25:14.999
Well, you could get a dishcloth
and dry some lids with me.

25:14.999 --> 25:17.999
Oh, you want me to dry with you.
I'll dry with you, then.

25:19.999 --> 25:20.999
Okay.

25:20.999 --> 25:23.999
- Give me 150 feet.
- Copy, 1-5-0.

25:23.999 --> 25:25.999
[grunting]

25:30.999 --> 25:34.999
- All right, lock it down there.
- Yeah, we're on the bottom.

25:34.999 --> 25:36.999
(Lee)
All the toys are gonna go
in the water--

25:36.999 --> 25:38.999
two jet skis and two Seabobs.

25:42.999 --> 25:44.999
- You got both of 'em?
- Perfect.

25:44.999 --> 25:46.999
You're good.

25:46.999 --> 25:49.000
- Sir?
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.

25:49.999 --> 25:51.999
- My pleasure.
- Gracias.

25:58.999 --> 26:00.999
I know we're having a party
for you guys later.

26:00.999 --> 26:01.999
That's gonna be crazy.

26:01.999 --> 26:03.999
Oh, it's gonna be
interesting.

26:03.999 --> 26:06.999
It'll be the first time
I went to a foam party.

26:06.999 --> 26:08.999
- Yeah.
- I got my swim tux on.

26:08.999 --> 26:09.999
Oh, my God.

26:09.999 --> 26:11.999
I have respect for Steve.

26:11.999 --> 26:13.999
He loves champagne,

26:13.999 --> 26:15.999
tuxedo jacket
when he's jet skiing,

26:15.999 --> 26:18.999
so he dresses well
for casual occasions.

26:18.999 --> 26:19.999
It doesn't fit
like it used to, but...

26:19.999 --> 26:20.999
[laughs]

26:20.999 --> 26:22.999
Steve might be
my spirit animal.

26:22.999 --> 26:24.999
He's clearly an animal.

26:24.999 --> 26:27.999
James Bond over here.
Oh, that's incredible, man.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.999
Don, Don, Eddie.

26:33.999 --> 26:35.999
How long have you been
in the yachting industry?

26:35.999 --> 26:36.999
I've been working on boats
for a long time,

26:36.999 --> 26:38.999
and I'd always been
the chief engineer,

26:38.999 --> 26:42.999
so I guess this is me adapting
to, you know, multitasking.

26:42.999 --> 26:43.999
Donny, Donny, Eddie.

26:43.999 --> 26:46.999
Okay, so, hey,
I'm, like, stew chef

26:46.999 --> 26:48.999
or, like, not even cheffing,
so I'm just the stew.

26:48.999 --> 26:51.999
It took a minute, and now I'm
feeling really good about it.

26:51.999 --> 26:53.999
I didn't go to culinary school

26:53.999 --> 26:55.999
to make beds
and, like, fluff pillows.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.999
But if I can clean a little bit
and help out in the kitchen here

26:59.999 --> 27:02.999
and help me get
to where I want to go,

27:02.999 --> 27:05.999
I'm gonna give it some passion,
and can I tell you something?

27:05.999 --> 27:06.999
I've got passion.

27:09.999 --> 27:11.999
- What's Don doing?
- Where's Don?

27:11.999 --> 27:13.999
- I don't know. I'll call Don.
- Yeah, where's Don?

27:13.999 --> 27:14.999
I think they're calling you
right now.

27:14.999 --> 27:16.000
Are they?
Hey, go ahead.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.999
Let's put
the jet skis away.

27:23.999 --> 27:25.999
Making everything
look pretty.

27:25.999 --> 27:28.999
- We're trying.
- Almost as pretty as you.

27:28.999 --> 27:30.999
Oh, listen to you.
You're too sweet.

27:35.999 --> 27:36.999
We get trash bags.

27:36.999 --> 27:38.999
Something to contain the foam.

27:38.999 --> 27:39.999
Oh, yeah,
and it's a dance floor!

27:39.999 --> 27:41.999
On the toggle switch,
which one do you use--

27:41.999 --> 27:43.000
free fall
or the other one?

27:43.999 --> 27:44.999
- Plug the red connectors in...
- Yeah.

27:44.999 --> 27:45.999
- And then just twist that.
- Got ya.

27:45.999 --> 27:47.999
Is the master
drinking champagne still?

27:47.999 --> 27:49.999
(Amy)
Master is just floating.

27:49.999 --> 27:52.999
Yeah, on a bubble,
a champagne bubble.

27:52.999 --> 27:55.999
I want to go--I want to go
fáááing see

27:55.999 --> 27:57.999
if we can go
meet Aerosmith.

28:02.999 --> 28:04.999
So do you have
a girlfriend or what?

28:04.999 --> 28:07.999
Well, uh, no.
Yes.

28:07.999 --> 28:08.999
Who says no and then yes?

28:08.999 --> 28:10.999
Me because it doesn't matter.

28:10.999 --> 28:12.000
I'm working.

28:12.999 --> 28:15.999
I love having pretty girls
around me.

28:15.999 --> 28:17.999
And I love having
the attention.

28:17.999 --> 28:19.999
On this boat,
we have a good selection.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.999
[laughs]

28:21.999 --> 28:23.000
It's either one or the other.
So which one is it?

28:23.999 --> 28:25.999
It's complicated.

28:25.999 --> 28:26.999
- Is it a no?
- And you? And you?

28:26.999 --> 28:28.999
Do you have a boyfriend?

28:28.999 --> 28:29.999
A simple no.

28:29.999 --> 28:31.999
Okay.

28:31.999 --> 28:33.999
No, I'm single. I'm free.
I can do whatever I want.

28:33.999 --> 28:35.999
(Eddie)
All right, start
taking it up slow.

28:35.999 --> 28:36.999
(Don)
Okay, come up slow.

28:36.999 --> 28:38.999
Yeah?
Fair enough.

28:38.999 --> 28:40.999
(Eddie)
Hold it there.

28:40.999 --> 28:41.999
Hold!

28:53.999 --> 28:55.999
He is a deckhand before he is
a second engineer.

28:55.999 --> 28:57.999
So, if I'm telling him
to get off the controls,

28:57.999 --> 28:59.999
get off the controls.

28:59.999 --> 29:01.000
If I tell you,
"Listen, I need to take it,"

29:01.999 --> 29:03.999
don't tell me to go talk to
somebody and tell you about it.

29:03.999 --> 29:05.999
I might have worded it wrong,
but you understand
where I was coming from.

29:05.999 --> 29:07.999
No, I understand.

29:07.999 --> 29:08.999
If that same thing
happened to you,

29:08.999 --> 29:09.999
wouldn't you react
the same way?

29:09.999 --> 29:11.999
- Yeah. No.
- Yeah.

29:11.999 --> 29:12.999
I would've been like,
"Okay, that's weird,"

29:12.999 --> 29:14.999
but I wouldn't
have questioned you.

29:14.999 --> 29:16.999
I got hired on this boat
for my engineering skills,

29:16.999 --> 29:18.999
not to be bossed around
by a guy on deck.

29:18.999 --> 29:19.999
For me, it was just
so out of left field.

29:19.999 --> 29:21.999
What?

29:21.999 --> 29:22.999
Like, "I'm your boss,"
'cause I'm your deckhand.

29:22.999 --> 29:23.999
But I am your boss.

29:23.999 --> 29:25.999
When you're working
the deck...

29:25.999 --> 29:26.999
- I am your boss.
- Mm.

29:26.999 --> 29:28.999
It's that simple.

29:31.999 --> 29:33.999
[screams]

29:33.999 --> 29:36.999
- Foam party 2015!
- Foam party!

29:36.999 --> 29:38.999
And we've been pumping alcohol
at him.

29:38.999 --> 29:40.999
Let's get
the foam going.

29:40.999 --> 29:42.999
But now he just needs
to go to bed.

29:42.999 --> 29:45.999
Come on, make it happen.
Neck deep, neck deep.

29:53.999 --> 29:55.999
What do they really talk about?
Mm-hmm.

29:55.999 --> 29:57.999
- You're peeing?
- Yeah.

29:57.999 --> 29:59.999
(Steve)
Pee! Pee!

29:59.999 --> 30:03.000
- Hey! Fáááing--
- Pee! Shh, quiet.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.999
They aren't having really deep,
meaningful conversation.

30:05.999 --> 30:06.999
(Steve)
Pee!

30:06.999 --> 30:08.999
[whispering]
Rocky--

30:08.999 --> 30:09.999
No, don't go in there.

30:09.999 --> 30:13.999
Fáááing--Shh.
Oh, she peed!

30:15.999 --> 30:17.999
And your face, like...
[laughs]

30:17.999 --> 30:20.999
I literally
almost peed myself.

30:20.999 --> 30:21.999
Let's go eat dinner!

30:26.999 --> 30:29.999
When you're working the deck,
I am your boss.

30:29.999 --> 30:31.999
He comes on to a brand-new boat
as a brand-new crew,

30:31.999 --> 30:33.999
and he expects to be able
to come in

30:33.999 --> 30:35.999
and say no
to a direct order.

30:35.999 --> 30:37.000
Not gonna happen at all.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.999
- It wasn't the right control.
- Yeah.

30:39.999 --> 30:42.999
If it was out of left field,
I'm sorry,

30:42.999 --> 30:45.999
but sometimes you just got to
say "okay" and deal with it.

30:45.999 --> 30:48.999
I immediately kind of got a real
look at who Don really is.

30:48.999 --> 30:50.999
Anything I can help with?
I don't really care.

30:50.999 --> 30:55.999
He doesn't like, uh,
me being his boss, obviously.

30:55.999 --> 30:57.999
I know, but let him do an
engineering job kind of,

30:57.999 --> 30:59.999
you know?

30:59.999 --> 31:01.999
Listen, hey, it wasn't my call
taking him off there.

31:01.999 --> 31:02.999
- I can see both your sides.
- Yeah.

31:02.999 --> 31:04.999
But I can see
why he's also kind of annoyed.

31:04.999 --> 31:07.999
Oh, I can see it too.
I totally understand
where he's annoyed.

31:07.999 --> 31:08.999
Okay.

31:08.999 --> 31:09.999
'Cause this is
a good engineer's job,

31:09.999 --> 31:11.999
but I don't appreciate him
questioning me...

31:11.999 --> 31:13.999
when I tell him
to do something.

31:13.999 --> 31:16.999
I kind of sometimes feel
like I'm the mom of the boat,

31:16.999 --> 31:19.999
and when I see some of the kids
aren't getting along--

31:19.999 --> 31:21.999
If I can be like, "You didn't
really mean it that way.

31:21.999 --> 31:23.999
Be nice to your brother."

31:23.999 --> 31:25.999
I just feel bad for him
because he's very sensitive.

31:25.999 --> 31:26.999
I can tell.

31:26.999 --> 31:29.999
What is a foam party?
I'm dying to know.

31:29.999 --> 31:30.999
Y'all, it's fantastic.

31:30.999 --> 31:32.999
Y'all are gonna have
so much fun tonight.

31:32.999 --> 31:34.999
You're basically dancing
in foam.

31:34.999 --> 31:36.999
[laughter]
- It'll be fun, I promise.

31:41.999 --> 31:43.999
- We're here!
- Well, welcome.

31:43.999 --> 31:45.999
- Here for dinner.
- Thank you.

31:45.999 --> 31:46.999
- We're ready.
- Great.

31:46.999 --> 31:49.999
- What do you think of this?
- This is amazing.

31:49.999 --> 31:53.999
- Oh, yeah, it's a robe party.
- Oh, it's nice and warm.

31:53.999 --> 31:55.999
Let's go eat dinner.

31:55.999 --> 31:58.999
Is there any way
that we can turn vodka

31:58.999 --> 32:01.999
into water for Steve...

32:01.999 --> 32:03.999
Yes.

32:03.999 --> 32:05.999
- Yes, there is.
- During dinner?

32:05.999 --> 32:06.999
Like a reverse Jesus.

32:06.999 --> 32:08.999
Ditch the clothes.
This is a robe party.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.999
No, my clothes stay on.

32:11.999 --> 32:12.999
Oh, God.

32:12.999 --> 32:14.999
Can I get any of you guys
a glass of wine.

32:14.999 --> 32:16.999
- Ditch the clothes--Yeah!
- Yeah.

32:16.999 --> 32:20.999
- White, Red?
- Champagne for me, please.

32:20.999 --> 32:22.999
I would pour maybe a little bit
just around it, like that.

32:22.999 --> 32:23.999
- Okay.
- A little in the middle...

32:24.000 --> 32:25.999
and just put this in the middle,
have your condiments

32:25.999 --> 32:27.000
in the middle and say,
"There you are, guys."

32:30.999 --> 32:31.999
Oh, that'll be cool.

32:31.999 --> 32:33.999
So, after I got off
the first jet ski, I went up.

32:33.999 --> 32:34.999
And I did the second one.

32:34.999 --> 32:35.999
- Yeah.
- Pissed him off.

32:35.999 --> 32:37.999
- Yeah, he came and asked me.
- All right, all right.

32:37.999 --> 32:39.999
I just told him, "I want you
to get confident with it first,

32:39.999 --> 32:41.999
"and then once you are--

32:41.999 --> 32:42.999
and then someone else
can have a go at it."

32:42.999 --> 32:43.999
Sounds good, yeah.

32:43.999 --> 32:45.999
Can we get a couple
of mojitos?

32:45.999 --> 32:47.999
(Kate)
Por supuesto.

32:47.999 --> 32:49.999
- Is there any more food?
- No, not right now.

32:49.999 --> 32:50.999
Unless he wants us to come
with the soup

32:50.999 --> 32:52.000
that goes on top of 'em.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.999
Pardon me.

32:53.999 --> 32:57.000
So do not eat this yet.
It's the beginning of a soup.

32:57.000 --> 33:01.999
All right, well,		 bon appétit!
Let's try it out!

33:01.999 --> 33:03.999
Not yet,
it's part of a soup.

33:03.999 --> 33:04.999
What?

33:04.999 --> 33:07.999
Oh, oh!
Qué es esto?

33:07.999 --> 33:10.999
It's actually Jamaican
conch chowder.

33:10.999 --> 33:14.999
Bon appétit!
Jamaican conch chowder.

33:14.999 --> 33:19.999
I'm, like, loving it.
This is, like, great.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.999
(Connie)
Okay, I'm gonna set up
the foam party.

33:22.999 --> 33:25.999
No, I'm coming
to assess the situation.

33:25.999 --> 33:27.999
I want to take trash bags...

33:27.999 --> 33:29.999
and cut them into sheets.

33:29.999 --> 33:30.999
Fake walls.

33:32.999 --> 33:35.999
(Steve)
So, anyhow, what do we have
for a drink

33:35.999 --> 33:38.999
before we go up
to the top deck?

33:38.999 --> 33:40.999
- We're not done with dinner.
- We're not?

33:40.999 --> 33:43.999
- We need to eat dinner.
[laughter]

33:43.999 --> 33:44.999
(Amy)
Cheers to you, Steve.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.999
He don't care
about everybody else's rules.

33:47.999 --> 33:48.999
Like, he just says
what he wants.

33:48.999 --> 33:50.999
I love
all of you guys.

33:50.999 --> 33:54.999
The primary has had quite a bit,
of champagne and mojitos,

33:54.999 --> 33:56.999
and he thought
that the first course

33:56.999 --> 33:58.999
was the entire meal.

33:58.999 --> 34:02.999
So just go
at your own pace.

34:02.999 --> 34:03.999
Surf and turf--

34:03.999 --> 34:05.999
I wanted to put a bit
of a twist on it.

34:05.999 --> 34:06.999
He did request
on his preference sheet

34:06.999 --> 34:08.999
he wanted a red-wine sauce.

34:08.999 --> 34:11.999
I did an amazing little
sangria red-wine jus.

34:11.999 --> 34:13.999
So it's got orange.
It's go cinnamon.

34:13.999 --> 34:14.999
It's got sour anise.

34:14.999 --> 34:15.999
Oh, my God.

34:15.999 --> 34:17.999
(woman)
I told you dinner
was yet to come.

34:17.999 --> 34:20.999
It's actually
Bahamian lobster tail, filet.

34:20.999 --> 34:23.999
You have carrots,
Brussels sprouts, zucchini,

34:23.999 --> 34:26.000
and over top,
you have a "sangri" jus.

34:26.999 --> 34:28.999
(Steve)
Fantastic!

34:28.999 --> 34:30.000
Oh, my God.

34:30.999 --> 34:33.999
This is unbelievable,

34:33.999 --> 34:37.999
The quality of this meat
is incredible.

34:37.999 --> 34:38.999
Oh, my God.

34:41.999 --> 34:42.999
Oh, this is really windy
up here.

34:42.999 --> 34:44.999
No wonder we're not gonna have
a foam party up here.

34:48.999 --> 34:50.999
(Steve)
I love you guys.
I love all of you guys.

34:50.999 --> 34:52.999
- You're all my best friends.
- Cheers.

34:54.999 --> 34:55.999
Today.

34:55.999 --> 34:57.999
I admit, at first,
I wasn't so sure about Leon,

34:57.999 --> 34:59.999
but all the guests
love his food.

34:59.999 --> 35:02.999
I'm impressed. I'm surprised.
I'm thrilled. I'm relieved.

35:02.999 --> 35:04.999
Would you like to come up
and deliver these?

35:04.999 --> 35:05.999
Yes.

35:05.999 --> 35:06.999
Leon, Leon.

35:06.999 --> 35:07.999
Nice light dessert there
for you.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.999
A nice little rum--
some people might like it.

35:10.999 --> 35:12.999
A rum panna cotta.

35:12.999 --> 35:14.999
It's just got fresh fruits,
beautiful mango,

35:14.999 --> 35:16.999
nice raspberries,
strawberries.

35:16.999 --> 35:18.999
- Enjoy.
- You've done a fabulous job.

35:18.999 --> 35:20.999
(Leon)
Thank you.
Team effort. Team effort.

35:20.999 --> 35:22.999
(Steve)
Yay!

35:22.999 --> 35:24.999
You have exceeded
our expectations.

35:24.999 --> 35:26.999
We're just starting.
We're just starting.

35:26.999 --> 35:28.999
- Enjoy.	 Bon appétit.
- Hey!

35:28.999 --> 35:29.999
(Leon)
Thank you.

35:29.999 --> 35:31.999
What's going on
with the foam party back there?

35:31.999 --> 35:33.000
- You know anything about it?
- It's ready to go.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.999
(Connie)
Everything's put up.
He said the hard part's done.

35:35.999 --> 35:37.999
Once it starts, it just
goes and goes and goes.

35:37.999 --> 35:38.999
- It's ready, okay.
- Yep.

35:38.999 --> 35:41.999
They've got
the foam party ready!

35:41.999 --> 35:43.999
- Whoo!
- Let's head down below.

35:43.999 --> 35:47.999
I haven't been
to a foam party since college.

35:47.999 --> 35:48.999
I'm kind of pumped.

35:48.999 --> 35:50.000
The professional said

35:50.999 --> 35:51.999
that's a little foam-party stage
down there.

35:51.999 --> 35:53.000
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.999
I got some glow sticks for you.
You want 'em?

35:55.999 --> 35:56.999
(Steve)
Are we ready?

35:56.999 --> 35:58.999
Y'all want to you go
to the foam party?

35:58.999 --> 36:00.999
- I'll lead you down.
- Whoo!

36:00.999 --> 36:02.999
All right, all right.

36:05.999 --> 36:06.999
Whoo!

36:06.999 --> 36:08.999
Come on!

36:08.999 --> 36:09.999
Come play.

36:09.999 --> 36:11.999
Es mi sueño.

36:11.999 --> 36:14.999
It's my dream. Come on.

36:14.999 --> 36:17.999
This is not a foam party...

36:17.999 --> 36:20.999
Neck deep!
Come on, make it happen.

36:20.999 --> 36:22.999
Here you go!
Cheers!

36:22.999 --> 36:27.999
Come on! Everybody get down here
for the party!

36:27.999 --> 36:30.999
Steve wanted foam
up to his neck,

36:30.999 --> 36:33.999
but the wind is blowing,
like, 25 knots,

36:33.999 --> 36:37.999
so it's just taking all the foam
and blowing it away.

36:37.999 --> 36:39.000
No foam party.

36:42.999 --> 36:44.999
[yells]

36:44.999 --> 36:48.999
Come on! All my guests,
get down here!

36:48.999 --> 36:50.999
Foam party 2015!

36:50.999 --> 36:53.000
- Foam party!
- Whoo!

36:53.999 --> 36:55.999
Come on! Let's go!
Get down here!

36:55.999 --> 36:56.999
Last season, when I worked
with Amy,

36:56.999 --> 36:59.999
I thought her cheerfulness
was kind of annoying.

36:59.999 --> 37:00.999
It was like working with someone
who's always on

37:00.999 --> 37:02.999
The Price is Right,
like, "Whoo!"

37:02.999 --> 37:06.999
But this time,
I love Amy's talent.

37:06.999 --> 37:07.999
I could be blowing bubbles,

37:07.999 --> 37:10.999
and that would be the most
amazing foam party of 2015.

37:10.999 --> 37:15.999
- Foam is coming! Oh, yeah!
- Whoo!

37:15.999 --> 37:19.999
[laughter]
- [screaming]

37:19.999 --> 37:22.999
[shouting indistinctly]

37:22.999 --> 37:26.999
- Aah!
- Whoo!

37:26.999 --> 37:28.999
Music! Whoo!

37:28.999 --> 37:33.999
I'm DJ--I can't.
Hey, you guys go. I'm DJing.

37:33.999 --> 37:36.999
I see him, and nobody
really wants to dance with him,

37:36.999 --> 37:38.999
and I'm like, "You know what?
I'll go hit the foam."

37:38.999 --> 37:41.999
Might as well
give him 100%.

37:41.999 --> 37:42.999
Come on, come on, baby.

37:42.999 --> 37:45.999
- Oh, this guy's great.
- Where's the champagne?

37:45.999 --> 37:48.999
Hey! Hey!
Quita las manos, papi!

37:48.999 --> 37:49.999
Steve's gonna have fun.
Guess what.

37:49.999 --> 37:52.999
He has ton of money.
He rented this yacht.

37:52.999 --> 37:54.999
If he wants to get
a little touchy-feely,

37:54.999 --> 37:55.999
I can totally deal with that.

37:55.999 --> 37:57.999
I'd be flirting
with girls too.

37:57.999 --> 37:58.999
Do you have a boyfriend?

37:58.999 --> 38:00.999
- Nope, single.
- All right, cool.

38:00.999 --> 38:04.999
- Ah!
[both laughing]

38:04.999 --> 38:06.999
Foam party!
Whoo!

38:07.000 --> 38:08.999
So much foam!

38:08.999 --> 38:09.999
Who the fááá are you?
[laughs]

38:09.999 --> 38:11.999
Oh, I'm the boatswain.

38:11.999 --> 38:12.999
- The boatswain.
- Yeah!

38:12.999 --> 38:14.999
All right,
we love the boatswain.

38:14.999 --> 38:17.999
Join us!
More foam!

38:17.999 --> 38:19.999
More foam, boatswain!

38:19.999 --> 38:22.999
- Get in on it!
- Aah!

38:22.999 --> 38:23.999
Steve is...

38:23.999 --> 38:24.999
Wow.

38:24.999 --> 38:26.999
[laughs]

38:26.999 --> 38:27.999
He has taken
having a good time

38:27.999 --> 38:29.999
to a level I wasn't sure
was attainable.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
More foam!

38:32.000 --> 38:33.999
All right, guys,
I got to get out of here.

38:33.999 --> 38:36.999
- Deuces.
- No, get it going! The foam!

38:36.999 --> 38:38.999
Let's get the foam going.

38:38.999 --> 38:40.999
- I guess I'm the bad guy.
[woman shouting]

38:41.000 --> 38:43.999
- No!
- I got to be the bad guy.

38:43.999 --> 38:45.999
No, no, no, no.
This is not even close.

38:45.999 --> 38:47.000
Yes, I'm sorry.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.999
He can make a neck-deep
foam party.

38:49.999 --> 38:50.999
Honey.

38:50.999 --> 38:52.999
He can make it happen.

38:52.999 --> 38:54.999
We've been pumping alcohol
in him

38:54.999 --> 38:56.999
since he's gotten here,
because he's requested it,

38:56.999 --> 38:58.999
but now he just needs
to go to bed.

38:58.999 --> 39:01.999
Come on, make it happen.
Neck deep, neck deep.

39:01.999 --> 39:04.999
We want to party on		 Eros!

39:04.999 --> 39:07.999
[laughing]

39:08.999 --> 39:10.999
This is sick!

39:12.999 --> 39:14.999
Did he say
"crew on the mast"?

39:14.999 --> 39:15.999
Do, like,
something gangster.

39:15.999 --> 39:18.999
- "Crew on the mast"?
- Oh, my God.

39:26.999 --> 39:27.999
You doing okay
in there, Rocky?

39:27.999 --> 39:29.999
Yeah, but I want
to be out here.

39:29.999 --> 39:31.999
I don't want to be down there
making a bed

39:31.999 --> 39:32.999
when it's like this.

39:32.999 --> 39:34.999
Just say this with me--
"the motion of the ocean."

39:34.999 --> 39:36.999
Think of me as this, like,
little dolphin, mermaid,

39:36.999 --> 39:39.999
crazy energetic,
crazy water person

39:39.999 --> 39:42.999
and I'm stuck...
[imitates whooshing]

39:42.999 --> 39:46.999
below deck
with no windows, no air.

39:46.999 --> 39:48.000
I'm tripping.

39:48.999 --> 39:49.999
I want to take
a quick picture.

39:49.999 --> 39:50.999
[camera shutter clicks]

39:50.999 --> 39:52.999
It's kind of hard.

39:52.999 --> 39:54.999
Can we get up?
Just go, like, quick.

39:54.999 --> 39:57.999
Rocky's a hot mess of fun,
and I love adventure.

39:57.999 --> 39:59.999
So, yeah, of course
I'm gonna follow her.

39:59.999 --> 40:02.999
What do you expect?

40:02.999 --> 40:04.999
(Rocky)
Oh, yeah. This is sick!

40:04.999 --> 40:08.999
Emile! Emile! Come on.
Get up here.

40:08.999 --> 40:09.999
This is all right.

40:09.999 --> 40:12.999
- Watch out for those things.
- Yeah.

40:12.999 --> 40:14.999
You want a photo?

40:14.999 --> 40:17.999
- Look at it.
- Here, here, here.

40:17.999 --> 40:19.999
Watch--Don't--
That's where you're standing.

40:19.999 --> 40:20.999
[Rocky giggles]

40:23.999 --> 40:25.999
- Did he "say crew on the mast"?
- Did you hear that?

40:25.999 --> 40:28.999
- "Crew on the mast."
- Oh, my God.

40:28.999 --> 40:30.999
Who's up there?

40:32.999 --> 40:34.999
God damn it.

40:34.999 --> 40:36.999
Do, like, something gangster.
Be, like...

40:36.999 --> 40:39.999
(Kate)
I've never heard of anything

40:39.999 --> 40:42.999
like this in yachting
happening ever,

40:42.999 --> 40:44.999
'cause that's how stupid it is.

40:44.999 --> 40:45.999
[laughs]

40:45.999 --> 40:47.999
All right, you guys need
to come down off of there.

40:47.999 --> 40:49.999
We're in trouble.
Sháá.

40:49.999 --> 40:51.999
If the boat is rocking one foot,

40:51.999 --> 40:54.999
on the top of the mast,
it's gonna be rocking five feet.

40:54.999 --> 40:56.999
It'd make it very easy
to fall off the boat.

40:56.999 --> 40:58.999
You'll probably die.
We'll never find you.

40:58.999 --> 41:01.999
Go down, just go.
Fááá. I hate sháá like that.

41:01.999 --> 41:04.999
(Rocky)
We're in trouble.

41:04.999 --> 41:05.999
(Eddie)
This season on Below Deck...

41:05.999 --> 41:07.999
I'm the king of the world!

41:07.999 --> 41:10.999
Whoo!

41:10.999 --> 41:13.999
Life doesn't get
any better than this.

41:13.999 --> 41:16.999
- All right, let's do this.
- Copy that.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.999
Here we are,
living, working, and playing

41:20.999 --> 41:23.999
amongst the richest people
in America.

41:23.999 --> 41:24.999
Hi, Mom!

41:24.999 --> 41:25.999
This is like
"Bathtub Confessions."

41:25.999 --> 41:27.000
Anybody need a refill?

41:27.000 --> 41:28.999
[laughter]

41:28.999 --> 41:31.999
(Rocky)
Money, money, money, money.

41:31.999 --> 41:32.999
(Amy)
We're getting
to live in a palace,

41:32.999 --> 41:35.999
but, um...

41:35.999 --> 41:36.999
I'm maid.

41:36.999 --> 41:38.999
(all)
Hi!

41:38.999 --> 41:39.999
(Connie)
Who are they?

41:39.999 --> 41:41.999
Cynthia Bailey is
a Real Housewife from Atlanta.

41:41.999 --> 41:43.000
From Tapout.
Huge.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.999
200 million.
Sold.

41:45.999 --> 41:48.999
Everybody gets an equal share
of the tips.

41:48.999 --> 41:51.999
- 25 large.
- Yeah!

41:51.999 --> 41:52.999
Oh.

41:52.999 --> 41:53.999
You've got a girl
back home?

41:53.999 --> 41:55.999
Okay, good answer.

41:55.999 --> 41:57.999
I'm an equal-opportunity dater.

41:57.999 --> 42:00.999
I love having
pretty girls around.

42:00.999 --> 42:01.999
[laughing]

42:01.999 --> 42:03.999
They're perfect for each other.
They're both batsháá crazy.

42:03.999 --> 42:06.999
Losing my frickin'--
I'm losing it.

42:06.999 --> 42:08.000
[shouting wildly]

42:08.999 --> 42:10.999
Cabin fever is real,
and it makes you crazy.

42:10.999 --> 42:12.999
[laughter]

42:12.999 --> 42:13.999
I just want to say it
to your face.

42:13.999 --> 42:14.999
I don't like it.
Is that okay?

42:14.999 --> 42:16.999
Not like you say it
to other people.

42:16.999 --> 42:18.000
(Rocky)
We're all supposed
to get along with each other.

42:18.999 --> 42:19.999
- Mm-mm.
- You've come to save us?

42:19.999 --> 42:20.999
I don't know
what I'm here for.

42:20.999 --> 42:22.000
(Kate)
It's beautiful.

42:22.999 --> 42:24.999
Chef Leon's got fáááing
bull on that.

42:24.999 --> 42:26.000
You're spreading
these rumors.

42:26.999 --> 42:27.999
You're saying that something
happened between us?

42:27.999 --> 42:28.999
You're really fáááing
with me here.

42:28.999 --> 42:31.999
I made a huge mistake, huge.

42:31.999 --> 42:33.000
(Lee)
We screwed the pooch
so many times.

42:33.999 --> 42:34.999
I think we should have

42:34.999 --> 42:36.999
a fáááing litter of puppies
running around.

42:36.999 --> 42:39.999
I'm not gonna get fáááing fired.
You will get fired first.

42:39.999 --> 42:41.999
[grinding]

42:41.999 --> 42:43.999
- Aah!
- Whoa!

42:43.999 --> 42:46.999
It fáááing stops
here and now.

42:46.999 --> 42:48.999
There's your ticket.

42:48.999 --> 42:49.999
- Get the fááá off.
- You got your--

42:49.999 --> 42:52.999
Get your finger out of my face.
Back off.

42:52.999 --> 42:54.999
- Fire. That's fire.
- Where?

42:54.999 --> 42:57.999
- It's in there.
- Oh, my God.

42:57.999 --> 42:59.999
Rocky? Can you
unlock the door?

43:02.999 --> 43:03.999
You're just gonna walk away?
Rocky.

43:03.999 --> 43:06.999
- Yeah, she's jumping.
- Rocky's in the water.

43:08.999 --> 43:09.999
It's good times there,
right, bro?

43:09.999 --> 43:11.000
All right.

43:11.999 --> 43:12.999
[laughing]

43:12.999 --> 43:15.999
(Amy)
