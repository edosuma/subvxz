00:56.969 --> 00:59.972
Hey, honey. It's your mom.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.626
I just wanted to call again.

01:01.887 --> 01:03.454
I was hoping maybe you'd
answer.

01:04.194 --> 01:06.805
We just haven't heard from you
in, like, six days.

01:08.024 --> 01:10.766
We're all really,
really nervous.

01:11.419 --> 01:13.247
Your friends don't know
where you are.

01:13.464 --> 01:16.859
That new boy you're dating,
then you broke up two weeks
ago?

01:17.816 --> 01:21.211
If anything happened to you,
I'd just die.

01:22.212 --> 01:24.823
I love you so much.

01:25.041 --> 01:26.086
Please just call.

01:27.913 --> 01:28.871
Love you.

-This is Hera.
-Hera, it's me.

03:44.485 --> 03:46.138
Can you please
watch Corey tonight?

03:46.748 --> 03:48.140
I'm-- I'm at work.

03:48.358 --> 03:49.272
Can't talk to
your sister at work?

03:51.274 --> 03:53.537
Can you please help?
She'll just be coloring.

03:54.712 --> 03:55.974
No, I have to work.

03:56.497 --> 03:58.890
Tonight?
Like, just from 8:00 to 9:00?

04:00.109 --> 04:01.676
Look, I have to go.

04:01.850 --> 04:04.331
Fine. See you Monday. Love you.

04:10.206 --> 04:11.425
Was that your sister?

04:12.730 --> 04:13.688
Yeah.

04:13.862 --> 04:15.994
Is she single?

04:16.168 --> 04:18.432
Uh, yeah. She is, actually.

04:19.302 --> 04:21.217
-Are you single?
-Uh...

04:22.697 --> 04:23.741
kind of.

04:25.177 --> 04:26.266
I have siblings too.

04:31.836 --> 04:33.229
How many siblings do you have?

04:36.363 --> 04:39.017
Two from my dad
and two from my stepmom.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.238
That's awesome.

04:55.991 --> 04:58.776
Oh. Did you guys have
the conference room booked?

04:58.950 --> 05:01.431
No. It's fine, we're eating too.

05:01.605 --> 05:03.520
Oh. Cool.

05:03.955 --> 05:05.392
Have you ever been to Italy?

05:07.089 --> 05:09.091
-No.
-Oh, my God!

05:09.309 --> 05:11.746
You should totally go.
It's amazing.

05:11.963 --> 05:14.444
-I would love to.
-My family and I go every year.

05:14.618 --> 05:17.317
We go to Florence,
and then we go to Positano.

05:17.491 --> 05:19.797
Oh, is that the place where they
have all the houses built into

05:20.015 --> 05:21.451
-the side of the hill?
-Yes! And they have these

05:21.625 --> 05:23.714
really special lemons.

05:25.542 --> 05:28.066
Hera, have you been anywhere?

05:28.284 --> 05:30.765
Oh, I don't travel much.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.593
Neither do I.

05:33.115 --> 05:35.335
The kids are too young,
and Mike would never let me

05:35.509 --> 05:36.858
leave him alone with them.

05:38.381 --> 05:41.776
Hera,
what are you doing tonight?

05:41.950 --> 05:44.126
-I'm going on a date.
-With who?

05:45.170 --> 05:46.389
A friend.

05:46.955 --> 05:50.001
-Named... Zach?
-Really?

05:50.219 --> 05:52.787
Well, if you don't say anything,
it never really happened, right?

05:54.963 --> 05:56.791
So, have you guys
fucked in the office yet?

06:02.231 --> 06:03.841
We got a big one, team!

06:04.059 --> 06:07.410
$10 million account.

06:07.584 --> 06:09.630
-Let's go!
-Yeah!

06:09.847 --> 06:11.675
Sounds like
you owe us some champagne!

06:28.649 --> 06:31.913
So, I had an incredible night.

06:32.479 --> 06:33.523
Me too.

06:34.437 --> 06:35.395
Can I come in?

06:35.612 --> 06:37.614
No!

06:37.788 --> 06:39.660
What's wrong? I...

06:40.225 --> 06:42.184
You like the gift, right?

06:42.358 --> 06:43.794
I can buy my own plants.

06:43.968 --> 06:46.014
Not if you're only making $100K.

06:46.754 --> 06:48.495
What makes you think
I make $100K?

06:48.973 --> 06:50.453
Well, that's what I made
right out of college.

06:52.586 --> 06:56.198
-I make way less than that.
-Hera, I'm not trying to brag.

06:57.547 --> 07:00.463
Just saying, you can
come to me if you need help.

07:00.637 --> 07:02.291
With your tests, your accounts.

07:05.468 --> 07:06.513
And you are...

07:07.383 --> 07:08.471
so pretty.

07:10.995 --> 07:12.040
It sucks.

07:12.649 --> 07:14.651
There's a glass ceiling.

07:14.825 --> 07:17.785
Without help, it'll crush you.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.746
-I should probably get to bed.
-Hera.

07:22.920 --> 07:26.097
Come on, just invite me inside.

07:26.271 --> 07:28.622
I just moved,
so I have a lot of boxes.

07:28.796 --> 07:30.014
But you-- you could come

07:30.188 --> 07:31.276
-another time, maybe--
-Hera. Hey.

07:32.843 --> 07:34.062
-Hera.
-Zach.

07:34.541 --> 07:35.759
-Hera.
-Zach.

07:36.281 --> 07:37.457
-Hera.
-Zach...

07:41.983 --> 07:44.986
If-- if you didn't
want this to happen,

07:45.856 --> 07:47.379
why'd you let me
ask you out again?

07:47.771 --> 07:50.034
I mean, I live, like,
40 fucking minutes away.

07:50.208 --> 07:54.125
So I was-- I was
taking your lead on things.

07:54.299 --> 07:55.953
I thought you liked me.

07:56.127 --> 07:57.259
I do.

07:57.738 --> 08:00.131
I just-- I don't wanna be
another win to you.

08:00.697 --> 08:03.221
Well, you're making me look
like a fuckin' loser out here.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.009
Can we talk about this later?

08:09.793 --> 08:12.579
You could have everything.

08:18.541 --> 08:19.673
Come on.

08:20.369 --> 08:21.979
-Let's have some fun.
-No.

08:23.241 --> 08:24.547
-Let's just have some fun.
-Please stop.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.377
-Ooh, I like when you beg.
-No...

08:28.856 --> 08:30.814
No, please, stop. Please, stop.

08:34.601 --> 08:35.906
Just invite me inside.

08:37.342 --> 08:38.735
Just invite me inside.

08:40.215 --> 08:41.303
No.

08:41.782 --> 08:42.913
I don't want to.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.394
Do you want me
to turn the handle for you?

08:48.528 --> 08:49.572
Okay.

08:50.442 --> 08:51.531
Okay.

08:52.706 --> 08:54.621
It's that easy. Come on.

09:27.131 --> 09:28.219
Zach?

09:31.483 --> 09:32.572
Zach?

10:58.832 --> 11:00.268
You've reached
Zachary Osman,

11:00.442 --> 11:02.313
financial team lead
at Paver Financial.

11:02.531 --> 11:04.315
Please leave me a message,
and I or someone from the team

11:04.533 --> 11:05.752
will reach out. Thanks.

11:05.969 --> 11:07.057
Hey.

11:07.536 --> 11:11.148
Um, sorry I'm calling your work.

11:11.714 --> 11:15.065
I-- I don't have
your personal cell.

11:15.239 --> 11:17.938
Um, I just wanted to--

11:18.112 --> 11:21.419
to call and say hi
and talk about last night.

11:22.464 --> 11:23.552
Um...

11:24.814 --> 11:27.904
you left your jacket here,
and, um...

11:28.078 --> 11:29.906
and I really like
the flower you got me.

11:33.083 --> 11:35.477
Just call me back
when you get this.

11:36.608 --> 11:38.175
Okay.

11:38.349 --> 11:39.437
Bye.

11:40.612 --> 11:41.701
Bye.

13:20.364 --> 13:22.802
Can't sleep?

14:13.069 --> 14:15.593
-Hey.
-Hey. Sorry, it's late.

14:15.811 --> 14:17.073
I'm sure you're asleep.

14:17.639 --> 14:19.162
You want me to come
and get my jacket right now?

14:20.642 --> 14:22.252
Did you listen to my voicemail?

14:23.166 --> 14:24.689
How about I come over

14:24.864 --> 14:27.257
and you answer the door
wearing just my jacket?

14:35.222 --> 14:36.397
I don't have it.

14:36.614 --> 14:38.007
Is something wrong with you?

14:38.181 --> 14:40.140
Jesus.
You know what, never mind.

14:41.532 --> 14:42.620
Zach?

14:43.578 --> 14:44.666
Zach?

15:27.535 --> 15:28.840
What do we think?

15:31.017 --> 15:32.105
For work.

15:33.541 --> 15:34.585
For Zach.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.615
-Any plans this week?
-Oh, yeah.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.574
-What?
-Work.

16:07.053 --> 16:08.750
My man. My man.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.492
-Hi.
-Hey.

16:12.623 --> 16:15.148
You, uh, have something else
on your desk. Got it for you.

16:18.325 --> 16:20.675
Hey, good work on
those access to capital reviews.

16:21.371 --> 16:23.373
-You saw my report?
-Mm-hmm.

16:23.808 --> 16:24.896
Thank you.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.965
Coming in late on a Monday?

16:51.184 --> 16:53.273
Uh, it's before 9:00 a.m.

16:53.447 --> 16:56.711
Junior analysts tend to be
in before their team lead, so.

16:56.928 --> 16:59.322
Okay.
I'll be here earlier tomorrow.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.846
You're very smart,
and you do good work.

17:02.064 --> 17:03.109
Thank you.

17:03.935 --> 17:07.330
You just have some of
the non-tangibles to figure out.

17:07.504 --> 17:10.681
School can't
teach you everything.

17:10.855 --> 17:13.641
I just-- I wanna let you know
that this is my dream job.

17:14.859 --> 17:17.253
This is not a college,
and I'm not a professor.

17:17.427 --> 17:18.472
Okay?

17:22.345 --> 17:24.260
Trying to match your new plant?

17:26.001 --> 17:28.221
Yeah. I don't know.

17:28.395 --> 17:30.266
Okay, well.
You don't see clients,

17:30.440 --> 17:32.834
so you don't need to do...
all this.

17:34.575 --> 17:35.706
Okay.

17:36.664 --> 17:39.797
Uh, break down these financials
before end of day.

17:40.015 --> 17:42.844
Uh, if you see any red flags,
make sure to note it.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.063
Okay.

17:45.760 --> 17:46.848
Okay.

17:50.112 --> 17:51.244
Hey, Lori?

18:02.690 --> 18:04.474
-Hey.
-What's up?

18:05.388 --> 18:06.694
What did Borey-Lori want?

18:06.868 --> 18:08.957
She said I shouldn't
dress like this.

18:09.175 --> 18:10.263
What, hot?

18:10.915 --> 18:12.091
You're stupid.

18:13.222 --> 18:14.267
You dress like that for me?

18:16.007 --> 18:17.226
Matched the flower you got me.

18:17.966 --> 18:20.011
Oh.

18:20.186 --> 18:21.665
Yeah, I get it.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.019
Uh...

18:28.194 --> 18:29.282
what's with the, um...

18:30.761 --> 18:31.806
I took the condom off.

18:33.460 --> 18:34.504
What?

18:36.767 --> 18:37.855
Wait, did you--

18:38.378 --> 18:39.814
-Inside?
-How did you not--

18:40.293 --> 18:42.773
Wait, seriously?

18:45.863 --> 18:48.388
Uh, do you wanna
get lunch today?

18:48.605 --> 18:50.129
-Like, just me and you?
-You...

18:50.825 --> 18:52.131
have to take the pill.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.525
Can we talk during lunch?

18:58.311 --> 19:00.400
I was thinking...

19:00.574 --> 19:02.184
you could suck my dick at lunch?

19:07.015 --> 19:08.277
What the fuck is wrong with you?

19:10.323 --> 19:12.325
I just wanna
talk about Saturday.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.503
Sir.

19:16.677 --> 19:18.940
I-- I can't.
I'm actually with a client--

19:19.810 --> 19:21.682
That is
the VP of Acquisitions.

19:21.899 --> 19:24.815
Unprofessional bullshit.
I thought we liked each other.

19:24.989 --> 19:26.165
I do.

19:28.776 --> 19:31.866
This is what I fucking hate.
This is fucking bullshit.

21:30.114 --> 21:31.202
Hera?

21:33.727 --> 21:34.989
Hera, is that you?

21:37.513 --> 21:38.558
Hera?

21:40.516 --> 21:41.561
Hera?

21:46.261 --> 21:47.871
Why didn't you say anything?

21:48.524 --> 21:53.399
Weirdo. Um, hey, uh,
so, got anything good?

21:54.617 --> 21:57.228
I, um... ...I just
finished the last of mine.

21:57.403 --> 22:00.231
I stayed up late as fuck
last night, so...

22:02.451 --> 22:03.583
Oh, you're crying.

22:04.279 --> 22:05.976
Um...

22:06.629 --> 22:09.545
I was taking allergy medicine.

22:15.551 --> 22:17.988
Uh, anyways, so, you really
shouldn't cry at work.

22:18.989 --> 22:21.165
About work, or...

22:21.340 --> 22:23.429
boys, or whatever.

22:24.734 --> 22:26.083
They'll eat you alive.

22:27.041 --> 22:28.129
Any one of them.

22:29.913 --> 22:31.393
We're all carnivores here.

22:41.882 --> 22:42.926
Bye.

23:07.473 --> 23:09.475
Vicky?

23:09.649 --> 23:11.085
Vicky, I don't like this.

24:24.332 --> 24:25.899
90 days.

24:27.161 --> 24:28.205
You nervous?

24:29.598 --> 24:32.122
No. I was just
thinking about something.

24:32.732 --> 24:33.776
An account?

24:34.690 --> 24:35.865
Yeah.

24:37.171 --> 24:38.738
You're nervous. It's okay.

24:38.955 --> 24:41.175
I'm the big dog, and I'm scary.

24:41.349 --> 24:42.742
Except I'm not.

24:42.959 --> 24:45.005
-I hope I didn't offend you.
-Offend me?

24:45.179 --> 24:48.487
I have some pretty thick skin.

24:50.097 --> 24:51.533
You don't have to
be afraid of me.

24:51.968 --> 24:55.276
If you make money, I win.
Your success is my success.

24:55.450 --> 24:57.713
So, I just want us to be
on the same page, right?

24:57.931 --> 24:59.019
Right.

24:59.236 --> 25:00.542
So, tell me, what's going on?

25:02.675 --> 25:03.719
With me?

25:07.114 --> 25:09.377
I'm good. Yeah.

25:09.812 --> 25:10.857
You think?

25:11.945 --> 25:13.990
Yeah. I think I'm good.

25:17.646 --> 25:18.865
Crushing it.

25:20.301 --> 25:21.955
-Really?
-Absolutely.

25:22.129 --> 25:24.697
-So this is your first job ever?
-Yeah.

25:25.219 --> 25:29.789
I mean, I worked at a coffee
shop during college, but...

25:29.963 --> 25:31.747
I'd love for you
to make me a latte sometime.

25:35.359 --> 25:36.447
Yeah, sure.

25:36.970 --> 25:38.319
I'm gonna be honest,

25:38.493 --> 25:40.582
I don't actually know
what's in a latte.

25:41.365 --> 25:44.760
Uh, espresso and steamed milk.

25:45.326 --> 25:46.414
How much?

25:47.241 --> 25:48.198
Sorry?

25:48.416 --> 25:49.460
How much espresso,

25:49.635 --> 25:50.679
how much steamed milk?

25:51.767 --> 25:54.640
I'm not sure.

25:54.814 --> 25:57.817
You must know an amount.
Even a ballpark. Any amount.

25:58.992 --> 26:03.126
Two espresso
and a cup of steamed milk.

26:03.300 --> 26:05.346
So, how much liquid
is in a shot,

26:05.564 --> 26:07.696
and how much
does milk cost in bulk?

26:09.350 --> 26:10.394
I'm not sure.

26:12.919 --> 26:17.314
So much of what we do is
an imperfect exact science.

26:17.532 --> 26:19.273
In order to forecast
for our client,

26:19.447 --> 26:20.970
you need to know
what it is they do.

26:21.188 --> 26:23.103
For example, latte.

26:23.277 --> 26:26.759
Maintenance,
overhead, variable costs.

26:27.498 --> 26:29.675
We need to know
what they're capable of.

26:29.849 --> 26:32.286
I just didn't know
the measurements of the coffee--

26:32.460 --> 26:34.810
It's okay.
I believe that you worked there.

26:35.245 --> 26:38.031
I trust you, because deep down,

26:38.248 --> 26:39.859
I know what you're capable of.

26:40.337 --> 26:44.646
Risk is the possibility
of something bad happening.

26:45.429 --> 26:48.389
And if you know the outcome,
even if it's bad,

26:48.563 --> 26:50.217
then there is no risk.

26:50.391 --> 26:54.743
And trust alleviates
a ton of risk.

26:55.178 --> 26:56.266
And I trust you.

26:56.832 --> 26:57.833
Do you trust me?

26:58.051 --> 26:59.443
-Yeah.
-Don't just say it

26:59.661 --> 27:00.662
because I'm your boss's boss.

27:00.836 --> 27:02.316
-Do you trust me?
-Yes.

27:02.490 --> 27:03.970
-Yes?
-Yes.

27:04.144 --> 27:07.016
-Yes? Yes? Yes?
-Yes. Yes. Yes!

27:07.234 --> 27:08.496
All right. You're free to go.

27:11.107 --> 27:12.282
What?

27:12.761 --> 27:15.764
That was me approving
your 90-day onboarding.

27:15.938 --> 27:18.027
Congrats.
You're still on board, kid.

27:19.942 --> 27:22.379
Thank you.

27:27.994 --> 27:29.517
-Hey!
-Hey, hey!

27:29.691 --> 27:31.867
-Corey! Hi!
-Aunt Hera, I missed you!

27:32.041 --> 27:34.783
-Tell me "I missed you too."
-I missed you guys.

27:34.957 --> 27:37.699
-How's it going?
-Good. How are you?

27:38.787 --> 27:40.789
Aww.
Are you excited for tonight?

27:41.007 --> 27:42.573
-Yes.
-Yeah, me too.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.314
-Awesome.
-All right.

27:47.753 --> 27:50.059
You know, when you said you were
making lasagna, I thought...

27:51.321 --> 27:53.672
well, I just thought
you'd be making it.

27:53.889 --> 27:55.064
I don't have time to cook.

27:55.499 --> 27:57.197
Oh, yeah. I get you're busy.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.592
You know, when I was 23,
I was pregnant.

28:02.463 --> 28:05.858
Working, married, cleaned.

28:06.075 --> 28:07.729
I'm in a really
competitive field.

28:08.208 --> 28:10.166
Okay?
If I don't advance quickly,

28:10.340 --> 28:11.472
then I'll just get stuck.

28:12.734 --> 28:13.996
There's a glass ceiling.

28:14.518 --> 28:17.043
You're 23, relax. You're fine.

28:17.260 --> 28:18.653
I want to make C-suite.

28:19.436 --> 28:21.221
I don't wanna just
have some nothing job.

28:26.835 --> 28:28.184
When you come over next week,

28:28.358 --> 28:29.925
I'll show you
some of mom's old recipes.

28:30.665 --> 28:33.886
I don't even remember
what they tasted like.

28:34.451 --> 28:36.410
It doesn't matter.
You need to learn how to cook.

28:37.280 --> 28:39.369
And clean, for God's sake.

28:39.587 --> 28:41.284
You moved in here,
what, three months ago?

28:41.632 --> 28:44.287
Still looks like there's
spiderwebs from the last person.

28:44.461 --> 28:47.029
Corey... how was school?

28:48.291 --> 28:49.815
Did they like your pigtails?

28:51.077 --> 28:53.514
A boy pulled my hair, Aunt Hera.

28:53.688 --> 28:54.733
That means he likes you.

28:54.950 --> 28:57.561
Her dad used to pull her hair.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.085
Don't say shit like that.

29:01.957 --> 29:03.002
Are you drawing something?

29:05.178 --> 29:06.222
Can I see?

29:10.879 --> 29:11.924
What is it?

29:13.447 --> 29:15.014
A plant pod for you.

29:17.451 --> 29:18.582
A plant pod?

29:18.800 --> 29:20.236
Miss Deven.

29:21.542 --> 29:22.761
She died last week.

29:22.978 --> 29:25.111
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry, honey.

29:25.720 --> 29:28.723
My teacher says
they put her in a bag

29:28.941 --> 29:31.030
so her body can become flowers.

29:32.074 --> 29:33.772
Okay, that's enough.

29:34.337 --> 29:36.209
God, what are they
telling these kids?

29:36.383 --> 29:37.688
Why did you draw me?

29:40.517 --> 29:42.606
Because flowers grow.

29:51.006 --> 29:52.442
Actually,
this lasagna's real good.

30:02.104 --> 30:03.627
Hera.

30:15.596 --> 30:17.119
Hey,
I should only be a few hours.

30:17.293 --> 30:19.687
-This guy seems like a dud.
-How do you know?

30:20.906 --> 30:22.385
You can tell by his pics.

30:22.559 --> 30:25.388
He's cute, but he's,
like, hiking and kayaking.

30:25.867 --> 30:29.871
But he's got a good job
and no kids, so, just drinks.

30:30.045 --> 30:33.701
I won't feel pressure to...

30:33.919 --> 30:36.008
All right. Well, how do I look?

30:36.530 --> 30:38.837
You look great.

30:49.543 --> 30:50.544
Corey?

30:54.200 --> 30:55.244
Corey?

30:58.857 --> 30:59.901
Come out.

31:20.443 --> 31:22.793
Corey, what are you doing?

31:27.973 --> 31:29.931
Is this about
what your teacher taught you?

31:48.297 --> 31:50.734
Oh, my God. No...

32:01.832 --> 32:03.922
-Hey.
-Hey.

32:04.139 --> 32:05.793
How'd it go?

32:05.967 --> 32:08.100
Eh, you know...

32:10.276 --> 32:11.581
I thought he was a dud.

32:12.452 --> 32:13.888
He was.

32:14.106 --> 32:16.978
But he was really sweet
and kinda hot, so...

32:17.544 --> 32:19.850
we did stuff in his car.

32:20.025 --> 32:21.330
Is that what you wanted?

32:21.940 --> 32:24.768
Yeah. I-- I told him I didn't
think it was gonna work out,

32:24.943 --> 32:26.770
and he was just saying
he liked me.

32:27.249 --> 32:28.468
I don't know, it was cute,

32:28.642 --> 32:30.252
so I told him
what I wanted to do.

32:30.818 --> 32:31.993
He was cool with that.

32:32.559 --> 32:35.301
Might happen again.

32:35.475 --> 32:37.172
Corey? You ready?

32:41.263 --> 32:42.569
I didn't do anything wrong.

32:43.787 --> 32:44.919
I know.

32:45.398 --> 32:47.313
I had fun. I'm allowed to.

32:50.316 --> 32:52.753
I meant to tell you
about the guy at work.

32:53.319 --> 32:56.148
-The higher-up.
-Oh, the higher-up? Second date?

32:56.322 --> 32:57.627
Corey?

32:58.280 --> 33:00.674
Well, we went out, um...

33:01.501 --> 33:03.590
and then he dropped me off.

33:03.764 --> 33:05.113
I'm sorry, what are you saying?

33:10.162 --> 33:12.599
I'm just really sad
he doesn't like me anymore.

33:14.383 --> 33:16.037
Like, he won't even talk to me.

33:20.128 --> 33:22.087
Oh, Hera.

33:22.261 --> 33:23.436
What a prick.

33:24.132 --> 33:25.568
They can all be such assholes.

33:27.831 --> 33:29.572
-You okay?
-Mm-hmm.

33:29.746 --> 33:30.878
Okay.

33:31.400 --> 33:32.662
Where the hell is Corey?

33:33.228 --> 33:35.491
She fell asleep next to me.

33:36.492 --> 33:37.537
How long ago?

33:39.278 --> 33:41.671
-I fell asleep too.
-Oh, my--

33:42.629 --> 33:43.717
Corey.

33:45.284 --> 33:46.328
Corey!

33:52.204 --> 33:53.814
-Corey, you in here?
-Mom?

33:58.166 --> 33:59.602
I saw the tree man.

33:59.820 --> 34:02.736
Oh, baby, it's okay.
Time to go home.

34:05.217 --> 34:06.479
You saw a tree man?

34:06.653 --> 34:08.698
Are you feeding
into this with her?

34:08.872 --> 34:10.700
No more of this tree man stuff!

34:11.223 --> 34:12.920
God, this is exactly
why I feel so alone.

34:13.138 --> 34:15.575
I have to do everything on
my own, and what are you doing?

34:17.229 --> 34:19.709
Come on, Corey.

34:19.883 --> 34:21.842
-Love you.
-Love you.

35:17.202 --> 35:19.073
She looks like a dock worker.

36:39.980 --> 36:41.329
Frank, I got that email.

36:41.503 --> 36:43.679
Tea time at 8:00.
I'm gonna whoop your ass.

36:46.639 --> 36:47.683
Zach?

37:21.891 --> 37:22.979
Zach.

37:31.684 --> 37:33.338
...over our projections
for this year,

37:33.512 --> 37:35.601
and I think as we move forward,
what we--

37:42.085 --> 37:43.478
Hera.

37:43.652 --> 37:45.437
Did you have
the conference room booked?

37:46.264 --> 37:47.308
No.

37:48.222 --> 37:50.355
I just--
I had a question for Zach.

37:51.312 --> 37:53.140
-Sorry to interrupt you guys.
-Okay.

37:53.314 --> 37:54.881
-Back to business, then.
-What?

37:58.624 --> 37:59.668
What did you wanna know?

38:01.975 --> 38:03.063
Uh...

38:04.238 --> 38:05.283
Come on.

38:06.762 --> 38:07.807
Center of the room.

38:09.417 --> 38:10.462
Go on.

38:12.115 --> 38:13.203
Ask.

38:13.726 --> 38:15.249
Can you help me with something?

38:16.337 --> 38:17.425
What?

38:17.991 --> 38:21.821
Uh, I'm working on
some models for Lori.

38:22.038 --> 38:24.040
Um, I just-- I need your help--

38:24.214 --> 38:25.868
Hera,
what exactly do you wanna know?

38:30.177 --> 38:33.528
Capital asset
expected return rate.

38:33.702 --> 38:35.878
Couldn't look it up?

38:41.841 --> 38:44.322
Risk-free rate
plus market sensitivity

38:44.539 --> 38:46.889
times difference
between expected return

38:47.063 --> 38:48.021
and risk-free rate.

38:48.238 --> 38:50.632
Thank you.

38:53.156 --> 38:54.201
You can leave now.

38:55.898 --> 38:56.943
Sorry.

39:04.429 --> 39:06.344
All right, let's talk about Q3.

39:25.101 --> 39:26.364
Oh. Hey.

39:28.670 --> 39:30.759
Don't feel bad.
It was just a joke.

39:31.804 --> 39:33.371
Didn't feel like a joke.

39:35.460 --> 39:36.896
I knew this was gonna happen.

39:38.941 --> 39:42.728
I don't know why we hire women
who don't plan on becoming CFAs.

39:42.902 --> 39:44.164
You know I want to.

39:46.601 --> 39:48.081
Yeah, but what else do you want?

39:51.563 --> 39:53.652
I thought you were special.

39:53.826 --> 39:56.437
Boy, was I wrong.

40:00.354 --> 40:03.270
You ever-- ever
think about being a teacher?

40:04.837 --> 40:06.012
Maybe a nurse?

40:07.840 --> 40:10.320
You could--
Oh, you could marry a rich guy.

40:10.495 --> 40:11.931
I mean, you're hot, so...

40:12.105 --> 40:13.193
Yeah.

40:13.846 --> 40:16.196
Be a nice little
stay-at-home-mom.

40:19.895 --> 40:22.507
Oh, shit.
Is that what this is about?

40:23.116 --> 40:27.337
-I want this.
-Yeah, you aren't good at this.

40:32.299 --> 40:33.387
Zach...

40:35.215 --> 40:36.390
What?

40:37.217 --> 40:39.959
Did you--
did you still want, um...

40:41.917 --> 40:43.397
At lunch in y-- in your car?

40:53.059 --> 40:54.103
Did you take the pill?

40:56.105 --> 40:57.150
Yesterday.

41:03.809 --> 41:05.463
I think it'd be weird if we...

41:07.508 --> 41:08.901
I mean, we're coworkers, right?

41:09.945 --> 41:11.251
So, uh...

41:12.470 --> 41:13.775
Yeah,
and I got stuff to do today.

41:16.822 --> 41:17.910
What, are you gonna cry?

41:28.747 --> 41:29.791
Bless you.

41:46.982 --> 41:48.244
Fucking women, man.

42:25.630 --> 42:27.719
Hey, hey!

42:28.415 --> 42:30.286
Lori, I am so sorry!

42:30.722 --> 42:32.201
Can I help you?

42:32.375 --> 42:33.899
I thought you were
somebody else, I'm so sorry!

42:34.116 --> 42:36.554
Go to the breakout room. Now!

42:45.519 --> 42:46.564
I'm so--

42:50.655 --> 42:51.743
Hera.

42:52.265 --> 42:55.355
-What is going on with you?
-I'm sorry.

42:55.573 --> 42:57.400
Yesterday the dress
and today this.

42:57.575 --> 42:58.793
And you didn't
give me a breakdown!

42:58.967 --> 43:00.708
Ah!

43:01.143 --> 43:02.536
-Hello?
-Um...

43:02.710 --> 43:04.886
I know. It was late.
I was trying to, um...

43:06.453 --> 43:08.368
-I'm sorry.
-Do not say sorry again.

43:10.109 --> 43:12.633
Don't.

43:12.807 --> 43:15.593
I asked Zach for help with
one of the equations.

43:15.810 --> 43:18.334
-That's why it was late.
-Don't do that!

43:18.508 --> 43:19.858
Ask the guys for help?

43:20.075 --> 43:21.990
You either do the work
or you're let go.

43:23.383 --> 43:26.125
-We don't get to make mistakes.
-Okay. I'm sorry.

43:27.300 --> 43:28.518
That's the last time.

43:43.838 --> 43:45.274
-Hey.
-Hey.

43:45.492 --> 43:46.667
I thought you couldn't
talk at work?

43:47.537 --> 43:49.627
-I walked away from my desk.
-Cool.

43:49.844 --> 43:52.934
Well, I'm at the hospital,
so I can't talk long.

43:55.023 --> 43:56.198
Hera?

43:57.504 --> 43:58.636
Hera?

43:59.549 --> 44:01.769
I didn't know who else to call.

44:01.943 --> 44:03.379
I-- I don't know what I'm doing.

44:03.553 --> 44:04.903
Okay? This is so hard.

44:05.077 --> 44:06.905
This is so hard,
I don't know what I'm doing.

44:07.079 --> 44:09.124
Just take a breath. It's okay.

44:09.864 --> 44:11.692
No one's gonna die
if you mess up.

44:11.866 --> 44:12.911
It's okay.

44:16.044 --> 44:18.917
-Yeah.
-Bad stuff happens, but...

44:19.961 --> 44:21.484
we can't just stop
because of it.

44:22.616 --> 44:25.880
On to the next patient,
and on to the next, right?

44:27.403 --> 44:28.883
-On to the next.
-Good.

44:29.101 --> 44:30.842
Okay, I really gotta run.

44:31.494 --> 44:33.409
-Love you.
-Love you too, Demi.

44:34.367 --> 44:35.673
Thank you.

44:50.383 --> 44:51.732
Could you get the door for me?

44:54.387 --> 44:57.477
Cute plant.

44:57.651 --> 44:59.218
-Thanks.
-So cute.

44:59.435 --> 45:00.741
I think
I'm gonna call her Grace.

45:02.264 --> 45:03.309
Okay!

45:04.745 --> 45:06.007
It was a gift.

45:08.923 --> 45:10.359
Uh, I like your shoes.

45:10.533 --> 45:12.622
Thank you!

45:19.978 --> 45:21.414
Can you get the door for me?

45:24.983 --> 45:26.680
Oh. You know what?

45:26.898 --> 45:29.727
I'm so sorry. I'm meeting Zach.

45:30.815 --> 45:31.859
Sorry.

46:29.090 --> 46:30.265
I know.

46:33.660 --> 46:34.748
I know.

46:43.801 --> 46:44.802
Lasagna.

47:10.001 --> 47:12.177
Do you want some?

48:50.014 --> 48:51.624
Did you get a new account?

48:51.798 --> 48:54.888
Holy shit, you've been here,
what, three months?

48:55.062 --> 48:56.020
Ring it!

48:56.237 --> 48:59.545
Hey, everyone! Ring it.

48:59.719 --> 49:01.460
-I can't.
-You--

49:01.634 --> 49:03.549
You have to. They expect you to.
You--

49:03.723 --> 49:05.203
We have to
go through with it now.

49:07.814 --> 49:11.122
So, what was the account?
How much was it for?

49:12.993 --> 49:14.081
I didn't.

49:14.952 --> 49:17.302
I just was looking at the bell.

49:18.477 --> 49:19.608
Wha--

49:19.957 --> 49:21.523
Why didn't you say anything?

49:23.482 --> 49:24.962
She's got nothing.

49:26.354 --> 49:28.008
God, you look like an idiot.

49:40.673 --> 49:41.761
Come in.

49:42.718 --> 49:43.806
Hera.

49:46.200 --> 49:48.507
-Good morning, Lori.
-Mmm.

49:52.598 --> 49:54.817
I heard you just got back
from a family trip.

49:55.775 --> 49:57.995
I have time for one trip a year.

49:58.821 --> 50:00.127
Too busy for family, though.

50:01.694 --> 50:03.261
-You doing okay?
-Yeah.

50:04.436 --> 50:07.091
Good, cool. So,
I wanted to talk to you about...

50:07.265 --> 50:09.441
-day and a half late, but--
-I know, I'm sorry, I--

50:09.615 --> 50:11.182
But-- Can I finish?

50:16.143 --> 50:18.145
But you didn't
just do the report.

50:18.319 --> 50:20.539
You did all of it.

50:20.713 --> 50:22.280
The entire thing. Forecasting,

50:22.454 --> 50:25.457
and your risk transfer
recommendations are spot-on.

50:25.631 --> 50:27.285
-Yeah?
-Yes.

50:28.634 --> 50:31.158
We need to find
a happy medium here.

50:31.811 --> 50:33.987
You went from
prom dress to trash can.

50:35.336 --> 50:36.859
And you look sick. Are you sick?

50:37.469 --> 50:38.992
-I'm not sick.
-If you're sick,

50:39.166 --> 50:40.559
you need to tell me.
I can't get sick right now.

50:40.733 --> 50:41.777
I'm not sick.

50:44.128 --> 50:45.129
Okay.

50:45.303 --> 50:46.826
If you can keep doing this,

50:47.044 --> 50:48.697
fit in a bit better,
then in a few months,

50:48.915 --> 50:50.786
we can talk about
funding your CFA classes.

50:51.004 --> 50:52.527
I would love that.

50:52.701 --> 50:55.356
That's exactly what I need
to become a real analyst.

50:55.530 --> 50:57.663
Gabe recommended you
for CFA training.

50:57.837 --> 50:58.968
He said you've been
helping him out.

51:00.144 --> 51:01.188
Gabe did?

51:01.406 --> 51:02.842
Yes. Uh, go check your email.

51:03.060 --> 51:04.844
I sent you and Vicky
some things to review.

51:05.062 --> 51:09.109
-Vicky?
-Yes. Your little plant buddy?

51:09.283 --> 51:11.503
Are you having trouble hearing?
Do you not hear well?

51:11.677 --> 51:12.982
I can hear well.

51:13.635 --> 51:15.855
Okay. Uh,
it's not, like, a sinus thing?

51:16.073 --> 51:18.075
Because your face
does look puffy.

51:19.293 --> 51:21.165
-I'm not sick.
-Okay.

51:21.339 --> 51:23.036
You must have hearing loss,
then.

51:23.558 --> 51:25.560
Because you rang
that fucking bell.

51:29.042 --> 51:30.174
You can shut that.

51:46.364 --> 51:48.540
Oh, hey. Come on in.

51:49.758 --> 51:51.282
-Hey.
-Hey. Shut the door.

52:00.769 --> 52:03.859
So Lori told me that you
recommended me for CFA classes?

52:04.077 --> 52:05.905
Oh, absolutely.
You're crushing it.

52:06.123 --> 52:07.428
Thanks.

52:07.602 --> 52:09.474
We haven't worked
together at all.

52:12.346 --> 52:13.695
Look, I'm gonna be honest.

52:15.567 --> 52:17.351
Zach and I tag-team accounts,

52:17.525 --> 52:19.788
so I've seen your work.

52:20.485 --> 52:22.356
He goes in and schmoozes,

52:22.530 --> 52:24.663
and I do
the actual heavy lifting.

52:25.316 --> 52:26.360
Then we both win.

52:28.101 --> 52:29.624
You're not Ivy League

52:29.842 --> 52:31.887
like Zach, Vicky,

52:32.584 --> 52:33.802
a bunch of people.

52:36.022 --> 52:37.502
Ivy Leaguers play the game.

52:37.937 --> 52:39.504
They don't put in the hours.

52:40.592 --> 52:41.984
And...

52:42.420 --> 52:45.292
Zach told me that things didn't
work out between you two.

52:45.901 --> 52:49.166
Should I go to HR
about what happened?

52:49.383 --> 52:51.646
No. Don't go to HR.

52:52.647 --> 52:56.999
I mean, if my wife or daughter
were in your situation?

52:57.174 --> 52:58.653
Jesus.

52:58.871 --> 53:02.744
All right, HR's job is
to protect the company.

53:02.918 --> 53:04.355
You go to them and tell them

53:04.529 --> 53:06.226
that you had a fling
that went bad?

53:07.227 --> 53:08.837
Who do you think
they're gonna take care of--

53:09.055 --> 53:11.536
and I'm just being honest here--

53:11.710 --> 53:12.928
a top earner,

53:13.102 --> 53:16.236
or a female junior analyst?

53:24.244 --> 53:26.507
I just want you to
get the help that you deserve,

53:26.986 --> 53:29.554
because it's hard enough
being a woman in the workplace.

53:36.909 --> 53:39.651
That's really awesome of you,
Gabe.

53:40.434 --> 53:42.088
Us state-schoolers
gotta stick together.

53:45.352 --> 53:46.527
Thank you.

54:16.775 --> 54:19.865
-Jesus!
-Don't touch my plant.

54:20.039 --> 54:21.562
Are you being serious right now?

54:24.957 --> 54:26.524
Why do you have
the same plant as me?

54:26.698 --> 54:31.093
Oh, well,
I went to the grocery store.

54:31.268 --> 54:34.967
Your little plant cost $12.

54:39.841 --> 54:41.190
I'm here now. What do you want?

54:41.843 --> 54:44.585
Oh. Do you wanna go to lunch?

54:44.803 --> 54:46.413
Zach and I are going to lunch.

54:47.371 --> 54:48.633
Except...

54:49.373 --> 54:51.462
I'm actually hungry.

54:55.944 --> 54:57.337
Ow, Jesus!

54:59.861 --> 55:02.603
What the fuck is wrong with you?

55:07.956 --> 55:09.654
Hera just pulled my hair.

55:09.871 --> 55:13.048
Hera just hit me,
and now my neck hurts!

55:13.484 --> 55:15.007
Are you okay?

55:16.051 --> 55:17.357
I don't know!

55:17.531 --> 55:19.228
I don't know
what is going on with you

55:19.403 --> 55:22.580
or what kind of psychotic break
that you're having,

55:22.797 --> 55:25.496
but I-- I'm going to sue you,

55:26.105 --> 55:28.760
and you need to get help.

55:28.934 --> 55:30.457
God, my neck really hurts

55:30.675 --> 55:31.806
and I don't know--

55:40.032 --> 55:41.773
What the fuck?

57:16.998 --> 57:18.826
I want this to fucking hurt.

57:23.831 --> 57:25.398
I fucking hate you!

57:34.146 --> 57:37.932
Yeah! Whoo!

57:40.021 --> 57:43.677
Is everyone seeing this? Whoo!

58:06.874 --> 58:09.398
Stop.

58:10.617 --> 58:11.879
Stop!

58:12.837 --> 58:13.925
Stop!

58:14.186 --> 58:16.536
Stop, stop!

58:16.710 --> 58:19.496
Stop, stop, stop. Stop--

58:25.893 --> 58:26.938
What's going on?

58:31.072 --> 58:32.117
I fell asleep.

58:33.510 --> 58:34.859
You can't sleep here.

58:35.033 --> 58:36.687
And we talked about
how you're dressed.

58:37.688 --> 58:39.864
Do you have
a learning disability?

58:41.909 --> 58:43.607
It's okay if you do, but we
need to talk about options for--

58:43.824 --> 58:45.086
What the fuck is this?

58:46.610 --> 58:48.002
Vicky, what's going on?

58:51.440 --> 58:52.529
Did you do this, Hera?

58:54.748 --> 58:57.011
Did you fucking do this, Hera?

58:59.710 --> 59:01.886
I come into my office,
my plant is dead,

59:02.060 --> 59:03.627
it's swimming in salt,

59:03.801 --> 59:06.673
and my trash bin
is full of salt packets.

59:07.108 --> 59:08.501
Wonder how that happened, Hera?

59:08.675 --> 59:09.763
Hera?

59:11.025 --> 59:13.680
-I-- I don't know.
-This is bullshit.

59:15.552 --> 59:17.118
I'm gonna rip yours apart.

59:18.903 --> 59:19.947
Don't.

59:28.608 --> 59:30.305
Oh, my God!

59:34.309 --> 59:36.442
What the fuck is wrong with you?

59:36.616 --> 59:37.748
Oh, my God.

59:44.058 --> 59:46.539
Oh, my God!

59:49.498 --> 59:53.851
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

59:54.678 --> 59:56.984
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:00:03.251 --> 01:00:04.296
You okay?

01:00:06.037 --> 01:00:07.691
Is it cool if
I sit with you for a minute?

01:00:14.872 --> 01:00:16.003
Crazy morning.

01:00:18.571 --> 01:00:19.877
Vicky's kind of a bitch.

01:00:23.576 --> 01:00:26.231
I get why you're mad.
She's hooking up with Zach.

01:00:27.406 --> 01:00:28.537
It's just so shitty.

01:00:29.364 --> 01:00:30.452
It sucks.

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:38.809
Plus, that stupid flower thing
he does with every girl?

01:00:39.548 --> 01:00:41.681
-It's not stupid.
-No, no.

01:00:42.247 --> 01:00:43.291
Yeah, I mean...

01:00:43.901 --> 01:00:44.945
yours is great.

01:00:48.819 --> 01:00:50.124
Do you wanna give Zach
his jacket back?

01:01:07.838 --> 01:01:08.969
You know, uh,

01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:13.931
I can intro you
to some other firms.

01:01:14.105 --> 01:01:16.629
You're a talented analyst,
and they'd be down to meet.

01:01:18.239 --> 01:01:19.545
Thanks.

01:01:21.939 --> 01:01:25.507
You wanna get coffee and
we can talk about it some time?

01:01:27.248 --> 01:01:28.336
Dinner?

01:01:29.816 --> 01:01:30.861
Whatever.

01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:34.125
Do you need money?

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.604
'‘Cause I can give you money.

01:01:37.128 --> 01:01:39.696
I can give you $1,000.

01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:42.089
It just has to be our secret.

01:01:49.575 --> 01:01:52.491
-Is that a yes?
-Don't touch me.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:54.188
-I was just--
-Leave me alone.

01:02:32.183 --> 01:02:33.619
Why?

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:37.405
Why?

01:02:38.406 --> 01:02:42.323
What am I supposed to do now?

01:02:45.849 --> 01:02:48.199
What am I supposed to do now?

01:02:54.074 --> 01:02:56.076
What am I gonna do now?

01:02:59.079 --> 01:03:01.865
What do you want?

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:06.086
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

01:03:08.349 --> 01:03:11.004
Do you think that
this is some kind of joke?

01:03:16.401 --> 01:03:18.533
I know a joke.

01:03:21.536 --> 01:03:23.234
Fuck!

01:03:40.512 --> 01:03:41.948
Yes!

01:03:48.302 --> 01:03:49.869
I'll kill everything,

01:03:50.391 --> 01:03:52.219
and I'll make you watch!

01:03:54.526 --> 01:03:56.354
I'm a carnivore too!

01:03:58.747 --> 01:04:01.185
I hate you!

01:04:07.669 --> 01:04:11.064
Yeah!

01:07:24.257 --> 01:07:26.259
-All right, you stay in the car.
-But Mom--

01:07:36.704 --> 01:07:37.792
Hera?

01:07:39.272 --> 01:07:40.317
Hera!

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:47.889
Mom!

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:49.891
Come on...

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:52.198
Come on, Hera.

01:07:52.372 --> 01:07:53.939
Please don't be dead.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:03.166
Hera?

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.472
Hera, I see you in there.

01:08:05.994 --> 01:08:07.431
Hera, let me the fuck in.

01:08:18.137 --> 01:08:19.747
What are you doing?

01:08:21.967 --> 01:08:23.099
I'’m breathing.

01:08:24.535 --> 01:08:25.579
Ugh!

01:08:26.972 --> 01:08:28.278
God!

01:08:53.303 --> 01:08:54.695
Do you wanna tell me
what's going on?

01:08:55.261 --> 01:08:57.437
Tell me, because this is crazy.

01:08:58.264 --> 01:08:59.396
You didn't come over
for Monday dinner.

01:08:59.570 --> 01:09:01.180
You haven't answered your phone.

01:09:01.354 --> 01:09:04.531
Work said you got let go
last week for stabbing someone?

01:09:04.705 --> 01:09:06.707
She attacked Grace.

01:09:06.925 --> 01:09:09.319
-What?
-She attacked Grace!

01:09:11.103 --> 01:09:12.409
My flower.

01:09:13.801 --> 01:09:14.889
Mine.

01:09:16.369 --> 01:09:17.457
Where is it?

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:20.330
Or is it with the trees
you keep talking about?

01:09:21.287 --> 01:09:22.767
Do you know
how fucking hard it is

01:09:22.984 --> 01:09:24.986
to barely have time
to be a single mom,

01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:26.858
and work 60 hours a week,

01:09:27.032 --> 01:09:28.947
and take care of
an adult fucking woman?

01:09:35.432 --> 01:09:37.260
Crap.
I have to take Corey to therapy.

01:09:39.958 --> 01:09:42.917
-It's fine.
-Grace! Grace!

01:09:50.447 --> 01:09:51.970
He told me to do it.

01:09:58.542 --> 01:09:59.673
Hera?

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:03.634
Hera? Oh, my God.
You okay? You okay?

01:10:04.156 --> 01:10:06.245
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:10:09.161 --> 01:10:10.815
Hera, what the fuck?

01:10:12.033 --> 01:10:13.383
Oh, my God.

01:10:14.427 --> 01:10:16.951
I'm taking your keys away.

01:10:20.781 --> 01:10:23.697
Can you help her?

01:11:09.613 --> 01:11:12.093
Zach!

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:16.054
Zach! Zach! Zach!

01:11:23.801 --> 01:11:24.845
Zach?

01:11:26.107 --> 01:11:28.284
Zach? Zach.

01:11:29.981 --> 01:11:31.069
Vicky.

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:33.811
Vicky, where'’s Zach?

01:11:34.028 --> 01:11:35.465
-I don't know.
-Where'’s Zach?

01:11:35.639 --> 01:11:37.031
I don'’t know,
he doesn't talk to me anymore!

01:11:37.205 --> 01:11:39.469
-Where is he?
-Hera, stop! What is going on?

01:11:39.643 --> 01:11:42.123
Please, I need Zach.
I'll do whatever he wants,

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:44.256
but Grace,
she's ours and she'’s dying!

01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:46.127
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:47.738
You need to get out of here.

01:11:47.912 --> 01:11:49.696
It is a fucking plant!

01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:53.134
He made me take
the morning-after pill,

01:11:53.352 --> 01:11:54.919
but Grace, she's dying.

01:11:55.093 --> 01:11:57.400
I need someone to help her!

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:00.272
Now, listen.

01:12:00.838 --> 01:12:02.492
I'll be good to you.
I'm gonna be good to you,

01:12:02.666 --> 01:12:04.320
but you need to leave
or I'm calling the cops

01:12:04.494 --> 01:12:07.018
and slapping a restraining order
on your ass. Do you hear me?

01:12:09.716 --> 01:12:13.111
Okay. Okay.

01:12:53.456 --> 01:12:54.935
Do you wanna tell me
what the hell's going on?

01:12:57.329 --> 01:12:58.983
Where are we going?

01:12:59.157 --> 01:13:00.201
My house.

01:13:02.552 --> 01:13:03.814
I wanna go home.

01:13:03.988 --> 01:13:05.816
Why the fuck
would I take you there?

01:13:06.033 --> 01:13:07.818
So you can make me leave work
in the middle of the day again?

01:13:11.691 --> 01:13:12.736
The higher-up...

01:13:15.782 --> 01:13:17.349
I didn't wanna
have sex with him.

01:13:18.655 --> 01:13:20.134
What?

01:13:20.961 --> 01:13:22.876
And he made me take
the morning-after pill.

01:13:24.748 --> 01:13:26.924
Oh, Hera,
why didn't you tell me?

01:13:27.098 --> 01:13:28.839
I tried.

01:13:29.013 --> 01:13:30.101
Grace...

01:13:32.016 --> 01:13:33.060
The plant.

01:13:34.671 --> 01:13:36.150
I loved her so much.

01:13:37.674 --> 01:13:39.980
She made me feel like
nothing bad had ever happened.

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:44.724
I didn't mean to hit Corey.

01:13:47.901 --> 01:13:50.208
She'’s been drawing you
flowers ever since it happened.

01:13:52.471 --> 01:13:53.603
She feels bad.

01:13:54.952 --> 01:13:56.127
She shouldn't feel bad.

01:13:56.954 --> 01:13:58.825
No one should ever hit her,
including me.

01:14:00.610 --> 01:14:01.698
I'm really sorry.

01:14:07.138 --> 01:14:08.705
I really just wanna go home,
though.

01:14:11.185 --> 01:14:14.493
I-- I need to clean up
and-- and sleep in my own bed.

01:14:16.887 --> 01:14:18.366
I won't do anything stupid.

01:14:19.193 --> 01:14:20.368
Okay.

01:14:20.891 --> 01:14:23.241
But I'll be over tomorrow
morning to check on you.

01:14:25.069 --> 01:14:26.505
You can apologize to Corey.

01:15:50.415 --> 01:15:51.503
Goodbye.

01:17:09.973 --> 01:17:11.670
I have to go to the bathroom.

01:18:28.791 --> 01:18:30.227
Coming.

01:18:44.023 --> 01:18:46.243
-Hey?
-You good?

01:18:48.332 --> 01:18:49.637
Are you drunk?

01:18:49.855 --> 01:18:51.901
Uh, a couple of us
went out after work.

01:18:54.294 --> 01:18:56.732
Figured I'd come...
check on my girl.

01:18:58.429 --> 01:19:00.170
You-- you okay? You wanna--

01:19:00.344 --> 01:19:03.216
-Hey, do you wanna talk about--
-No, not really.

01:19:03.390 --> 01:19:04.783
I thought I was your mentor.

01:19:06.263 --> 01:19:07.307
You need to go.

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:09.440
Gabe just dropped me off.

01:19:10.136 --> 01:19:12.573
You want me to get a ride?
That's gonna be, like, $50.

01:19:12.791 --> 01:19:16.099
-I could really use some coffee.
-I don't have any coffee.

01:19:17.274 --> 01:19:18.318
Okay.

01:19:18.884 --> 01:19:20.538
All right.

01:19:21.191 --> 01:19:23.106
But you gotta tell me
what's going on.

01:19:24.585 --> 01:19:27.066
What, you were crying for me
all day and now...

01:19:27.675 --> 01:19:29.329
now, what?
You-- you won't look at me?

01:19:33.333 --> 01:19:35.379
Have you started
applying for jobs yet?

01:19:36.249 --> 01:19:38.469
I mean, that must have
been really embarrassing.

01:19:41.385 --> 01:19:42.952
I could write you
a letter of recommendation,

01:19:43.126 --> 01:19:44.736
maybe make a couple phone calls.

01:19:45.955 --> 01:19:48.609
Hey, just-- just
as long as us hooking up

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:50.481
doesn't get out, you know?

01:19:52.091 --> 01:19:53.179
Okay?

01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:55.225
What?

01:19:55.442 --> 01:19:56.792
I thought we had a good time--

01:19:58.532 --> 01:20:00.796
I thought we had a good time.

01:20:01.013 --> 01:20:03.363
What was good?

01:20:03.537 --> 01:20:05.322
-Well, you were great.
-At?

01:20:07.063 --> 01:20:09.108
-Getting fucked by me.
-Please let me go.

01:20:09.282 --> 01:20:11.328
-Oh, Hera.
-Please, let me go!

01:20:11.502 --> 01:20:13.678
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:23.993
All right. What-- what is wrong?

01:20:24.167 --> 01:20:25.777
You did this to me.

01:20:26.386 --> 01:20:29.085
What are you talking about?
You just pushed me off of you.

01:20:30.216 --> 01:20:32.436
I didn't want to
and you forced me.

01:20:33.132 --> 01:20:34.830
I didn't force you
to do anything.

01:20:35.265 --> 01:20:37.702
You ruined everything for me!

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:39.312
My career!

01:20:40.052 --> 01:20:41.358
Can you keep your voice down?

01:20:41.532 --> 01:20:42.750
You raped me.

01:20:44.448 --> 01:20:45.928
If you say that shit again--

01:20:46.102 --> 01:20:48.060
-What, that you raped me?
-You need to back down.

01:20:50.062 --> 01:20:52.195
See, this is why
you couldn't handle the job,

01:20:52.804 --> 01:20:54.023
or a relationship.

01:20:55.241 --> 01:20:56.808
You are fucking crazy.

01:20:58.549 --> 01:21:00.116
And now you want people
to feel sorry for you?

01:21:00.333 --> 01:21:01.769
Is-- is this a cry for help?

01:21:04.511 --> 01:21:07.471
You are just another
dumb fucking slut

01:21:07.688 --> 01:21:10.866
trying to whore her way to
the top of the corporate ladder.

01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:14.826
Oh. Are you gonna cry?

01:21:15.827 --> 01:21:19.222
You gonna cry some more? Huh?

01:21:19.396 --> 01:21:22.486
You couldn't even take care
of a stupid fucking plant!

01:21:23.356 --> 01:21:24.923
You can't keep a plant alive?

01:21:25.141 --> 01:21:28.796
What the fuck?

01:21:34.498 --> 01:21:37.501
Stop, stop, stop! Stop...

01:21:48.425 --> 01:21:49.861
I-- I'm sorry.

01:21:51.254 --> 01:21:52.298
Please...

01:21:53.604 --> 01:21:54.648
let-- let me go.

01:21:58.870 --> 01:22:02.482
I'll get--
I'll get you... a better job.

01:22:09.315 --> 01:22:11.491
I am the glass ceiling.

01:23:29.874 --> 01:23:31.310
You drew all these for me?

01:23:32.268 --> 01:23:34.009
-I felt really bad about--
-It's okay.

01:23:35.053 --> 01:23:37.055
You saw something beautiful
and you wanted it.

01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:40.189
Next time we'll ask permission,
though, okay?

01:23:41.494 --> 01:23:44.410
But no one should ever
hit or touch you.

01:23:44.584 --> 01:23:46.021
Okay? And I'm really sorry.

01:23:47.239 --> 01:23:48.762
And if anyone does, you tell me.

01:23:49.589 --> 01:23:51.330
Okay?

01:23:51.504 --> 01:23:52.679
Okay, Aunt Hera.

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:57.075
These are really good.

01:23:59.251 --> 01:24:00.687
You know, I used to draw.

01:24:01.558 --> 01:24:03.429
-I might start again.
-You should.

01:24:05.692 --> 01:24:07.129
Do you wanna see something nice?

01:24:14.658 --> 01:24:15.702
Look at that.

01:24:21.186 --> 01:24:22.361
It grew!

01:24:25.277 --> 01:24:26.322
