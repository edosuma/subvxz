00:02.482 --> 00:04.546
E. R.

00:04.747 --> 00:05.967
Previously on E. R.

00:06.068 --> 00:08.150
The tumor invaded
the eloquent areas of the brain...

00:08.251 --> 00:09.922
How soon can you operate?

00:10.123 --> 00:10.923
I can't.

00:11.024 --> 00:14.282
He won't send Rachel away.
It's like he has to prove he loves her.

00:14.383 --> 00:16.986
You shouldn't waste time with
someone you don't have chemistry with.

00:17.231 --> 00:18.958
Was it there for you?

00:19.659 --> 00:22.970
I did you a huge favor.
You just don't know it yet.

00:23.071 --> 00:26.140
- How's Elizabeth taking it?
- I haven't told her yet.

00:26.241 --> 00:27.891
So you're gonna keep this a secret...

00:27.992 --> 00:30.427
...act like nothing's wrong
until you pass out in public?

00:30.828 --> 00:32.692
Staying in a hotel
isn't gonna solve anything.

00:32.794 --> 00:35.017
Mark, I'm not trying to punish you.

00:35.418 --> 00:37.321
I'm just trying to do
what's best for Ella.

00:37.422 --> 00:38.783
So when are you coming home?

00:38.884 --> 00:40.500
I don't know.

00:41.216 --> 00:44.082
E. R. 8x17 "BYGONES"

00:49.310 --> 00:51.763

01:40.186 --> 01:44.476
See, the sun goes here.

01:44.644 --> 01:48.590
The star goes...
Where does the star go?

01:48.769 --> 01:51.518
Here. The star goes there.

01:51.687 --> 01:52.884
That's right.

01:53.062 --> 01:55.515
Where does the moon go?

01:55.936 --> 01:58.010
Where does the moon go?

02:00.686 --> 02:04.348
Yeah, moon. That's it, moon.

02:04.519 --> 02:06.475
Can you say "Mama"?

02:06.645 --> 02:08.551
Can you say "Mama"?

02:08.729 --> 02:10.848
Mama.

02:12.519 --> 02:16.596
- Oh, hi. You're early.
- I figured you could use a break.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.760
Well, that's right.

02:21.187 --> 02:25.845
Okay, I've just fed her.
I've put extra diapers in the diaper bag.

02:26.020 --> 02:29.884
Her hat and coat are on the nightstand.
And I wrote you a check.

02:30.062 --> 02:31.519
- Where is it?
- Dr. Greene paid me for the month.

02:31.645 --> 02:34.893
Oh, okay.

02:35.062 --> 02:37.895
You didn't happen
to grab the mail, did you?

02:38.187 --> 02:39.845
Fabulous.

02:40.020 --> 02:41.893
- Thanks.
- Say "bye-bye. "

02:42.062 --> 02:43.341
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

02:43.645 --> 02:47.426
Bye-bye, my love. Bye-bye. Bye.

02:50.145 --> 02:53.013
- What are you doing?
- Finishing my homework.

02:54.146 --> 02:56.184
- Ready in 20 minutes?
- Sure.

03:00.354 --> 03:02.741
- You okay, Dad?
- Fine.

04:14.650 --> 04:17.058
- Dr. Romano signed it.
- I'm supposed to do a hernia...

04:17.237 --> 04:19.728
...and a pancreatic pseudocyst today.
I don't see them.

04:19.906 --> 04:23.073
- Things change, Lizzie.
- Have you tampered with my schedule?

04:23.242 --> 04:25.236
- Trauma call all week.
- Any reason?

04:25.411 --> 04:27.238
You haven't covered the ER
in a month.

04:27.414 --> 04:29.703
I had to go down to that cesspool
twice yesterday.

04:29.875 --> 04:32.449
I'm catching up on surgeries.
I'll start next week.

04:32.544 --> 04:34.583
Start today.
With any luck, you won't be called.

04:34.755 --> 04:36.628
Right. That happens.

04:37.299 --> 04:39.091
- Did you pass out?
- No.

04:39.260 --> 04:43.257
We were tracking a black-crowned
heron, and I felt lightheaded and tingly.

04:43.430 --> 04:47.096
- She had stomach problems last night.
- That was just his cooking.

04:47.434 --> 04:51.563
Fifty of Benadryl, CBC,
chem panel, dip a urine.

04:52.773 --> 04:55.181
Have you noticed any changes
in your eyes, Joanne?

04:55.359 --> 04:58.314
- No. Why?
- Your sclera's a little yellow.

04:58.488 --> 04:59.768
Any recent illnesses?

04:59.948 --> 05:02.569
No. I do yoga and spin every day.
I'm in great health.

05:02.742 --> 05:05.660
- She's prone to panic attacks.
- Paul, I am not.

05:05.828 --> 05:09.032
- Deep breath.
- We bird-watch to reduce stress.

05:09.207 --> 05:11.994
I did not have a panic attack.
The eggs!

05:12.168 --> 05:15.419
Oh, we found a wood duck's nest
in the park.

05:15.588 --> 05:17.711
A raccoon was about to eat these
for breakfast.

05:17.883 --> 05:20.837
Can you put them someplace warm?
We think they're about to hatch.

05:21.011 --> 05:22.291
Sure.

05:22.638 --> 05:26.220
Add an AST, ALT, bilirubin
and a lipase for Joanne.

05:26.392 --> 05:27.970
- Okay.
- Vegan brownie?

05:28.144 --> 05:30.516
My sister's starting a pastry business.

05:30.646 --> 05:33.979
- I'll pass. Thanks.
- Man in uniform. Nice.

05:34.150 --> 05:37.484
They trot us out for recruitment
breakfasts. I was on Dearborn at 6 a. m.

05:37.653 --> 05:38.898
Yeah? Sign anyone up?

05:39.071 --> 05:40.946
No, but a coed gave me
her phone number.

05:41.115 --> 05:43.142
- You go, private.
- That's "lieutenant."

05:43.177 --> 05:45.490
- Lieutenant, do something with these.
- What are they?

05:45.662 --> 05:47.156
- Eggs.
- What do you want me to do?

05:47.330 --> 05:49.121
- They're supposed to hatch.
- Into what?

05:49.332 --> 05:52.868
- Who knows?
- Gallant, posterior splint, Exam 4.

05:52.903 --> 05:55.830
Kid in Curtain 2 needs
his earwax cleaned out.

05:56.005 --> 05:58.793
- I'm here to serve.
- Dr. Weaver, stabbing victim rolling up.

05:58.967 --> 06:01.209
Prep Trauma 1. Jerry, call the lab.

06:01.345 --> 06:03.053
They need my chemistries for Exam 1.

06:03.221 --> 06:06.342
- Mark, Susan, divvy up Kovac's passes.
- Morning to you too, Kerry.

06:06.516 --> 06:08.675
- Somebody sign for this package.
- Yo, Gallant.

06:08.852 --> 06:12.102
- I've got the eggs.
- Have you tried one of these?

06:12.272 --> 06:15.439
- I'll just lose it later.
- Yeah, good point.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.732
Jerry, there's something
to be said for animal fat.

06:18.904 --> 06:20.981
My sister's hard-core.
Nothing with a face.

06:21.157 --> 06:22.486
Someone call for a consult?

06:22.658 --> 06:25.778
- Dr. Corday, welcome back.
- I've only been a few floors away.

06:25.954 --> 06:30.367
A head trauma is threatening to go AMA.
I'll get this package to Dr. Kovac.

06:30.542 --> 06:33.377
Don't worry. He's not here.
He'll get it tomorrow.

06:33.544 --> 06:35.252
I'll find them.

06:36.047 --> 06:38.123
You waiting for something else?

06:39.676 --> 06:42.214
Can you talk?

06:43.138 --> 06:46.553
Martin, huh? You need a doctor?
You need help?

06:46.725 --> 06:49.477
Doc, this lady's got smoke inhalation,
some minor burns.

06:49.645 --> 06:51.708
- Malik, get him to Curtain 1.
- Got it.

06:51.743 --> 06:54.997
Fire at Martin Luther King Elementary.
She stayed inside to help.

06:55.032 --> 06:56.857
Space heater fell on a girl's sweater.

06:56.986 --> 06:58.646
All right. No swelling in the nares.

06:58.821 --> 07:00.897
Put her on a monitor.
Get a carboxyhemoglobin.

07:01.073 --> 07:04.196
- Heating's been out since January.
- This the stabbing?

07:04.368 --> 07:06.693
- Smoke inhalation.
- Some minor burns coming in.

07:06.871 --> 07:08.496
Plan on more. Second building went up.

07:08.623 --> 07:11.078
All engines responding. Gotta get back.

07:11.250 --> 07:14.584
Diana Hayes, 19, multiple stab wounds
in the right neck and chest.

07:15.129 --> 07:18.048
The guy that got bit by the
German shepherd calmed down.

07:18.216 --> 07:20.968
- How much Ativan?
- Six.

07:21.136 --> 07:23.923
He's relaxed and he's all yours.
I'm out of here.

07:24.097 --> 07:28.724
- You still keeping vampire hours?
- Not that I sleep much during the day.

07:29.561 --> 07:31.933
- Luka doesn't have curtains?
- Not in the living room.

07:32.605 --> 07:35.975
- We got a lot of spare bedrooms.
- You lose some of the kitchen staff?

07:37.319 --> 07:40.605
All I'm saying,
a girl needs her beauty sleep.

07:41.699 --> 07:44.845
- Thanks.
- Lipstick Mary's looking for you.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.480
She wants you to tell her shadow
to lay off.

07:47.955 --> 07:50.791
- It's not like it listens to me.
- Making any headway?

07:50.958 --> 07:52.583
With what?

07:53.377 --> 07:55.287
Stop it.

07:55.463 --> 07:57.705
I'll be at the 7:00 yoga,
if you want to avoid me.

07:57.882 --> 08:01.085
- Oh, sorry.
- No, it's quite all right.

08:01.177 --> 08:03.882
- A lot of glass, Nelson. How'd it happen?
- Candle.

08:04.055 --> 08:05.549
- Was it in a glass holder?
- Yeah.

08:05.723 --> 08:09.472
- Flying through the air at the time?
- Dr. Weaver needs a surgeon in 1.

08:09.644 --> 08:11.970
I'll be right there. Don't move, Nelson.

08:12.105 --> 08:14.317
Haleh, where are the baby warmers?

08:14.352 --> 08:16.349
Lost, stolen. Who knows?

08:18.653 --> 08:21.148
- What do we have?
- Stab wounds, neck and chest.

08:21.190 --> 08:24.132
- Tension pneumo.
- Pulse is thready at 110. BP's 80 palp.

08:24.167 --> 08:27.949
- How old is she?
- Nineteen. Student at Hamden College.

08:28.122 --> 08:31.067
Attacked in bed.
Curved Kelly, 32 French.

08:31.102 --> 08:32.164
How many wounds?

08:32.200 --> 08:34.700
- At least 10.
- There's blood all over the sheets.

08:35.004 --> 08:37.491
- Do you know about a weapon?
- I didn't see anything.

08:37.666 --> 08:40.005
- Thora-Seal's ready.
- Needle driver.

08:40.176 --> 08:43.111
- I thought Edson was on call.
- Settle for me.

08:43.679 --> 08:45.471
Neck veins are up. Trachea midline.

08:45.598 --> 08:47.140
Defensive wounds on both arms.

08:47.308 --> 08:48.507
What time did you find her?

08:48.643 --> 08:51.015
At 9. I always pick her up for poly-sci.

08:51.187 --> 08:53.974
- Was she able to speak at all?
- No. I thought she was dead.

08:54.149 --> 08:56.307
Muffled heart sounds.
Prep for a thoracotomy.

08:56.485 --> 08:59.771
There's more like 15 wounds here.
Do we know who did this to her?

08:59.947 --> 09:02.900
- I don't know. Everybody likes her.
- Lost the pulse.

09:03.074 --> 09:05.151
- Ten blade.
- Okay, rib spreader.

09:05.328 --> 09:06.703
Get ready for suction.

09:07.371 --> 09:10.076
I'm into the thoracic cavity.
There, hold that.

09:10.249 --> 09:11.363
Mark.

09:12.710 --> 09:15.829
Starting internal compressions.
I have a few minutes.

09:16.005 --> 09:17.749
Do you want me to make the call?

09:18.549 --> 09:21.835
-2-0 silk on a traumatic needle.
- See if they can change the time.

09:22.011 --> 09:24.418
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.
- It's better if you wait outside.

09:24.597 --> 09:26.140
- I'm okay.
- Prep internal paddles.

09:26.307 --> 09:29.343
- We're losing this one too!
- Grab a set of vitals.

09:29.519 --> 09:32.390
Get another gurney.
She may have hit her head.

09:35.400 --> 09:39.350
- Did a nice job on your neck.
- Shaving. I was in a rush.

09:40.739 --> 09:42.945
Your mom called.

09:43.576 --> 09:46.576
Four a. m. She still hasn't figured out
the time difference.

09:46.745 --> 09:48.239
I'm so sorry.

09:49.165 --> 09:50.658
Anyway...

09:51.500 --> 09:55.794
Two more sutures and we'll defibrillate.
Call the O.R. Have them standing by.

09:58.841 --> 10:00.964
Decisions, huh?

10:02.052 --> 10:05.920
At the end of the day, I think that
Cheetos are just as good as Doritos.

10:07.142 --> 10:09.264
See if I can get a soda.

10:10.687 --> 10:13.806
Martin, you were supposed
to stay over there.

10:13.982 --> 10:15.855
- Is this your guy?
- Sort of.

10:16.025 --> 10:17.768
- What's the deal?
- He can't speak.

10:17.944 --> 10:21.817
- Is that an emergency?
- There's something not right about him.

10:21.990 --> 10:25.240
Hey, I'm Dr. Carter, Martin.
How you doing?

10:26.119 --> 10:28.954
- What, is he deaf, too?
- Martin?

10:29.123 --> 10:31.115
Can you turn around?

10:32.209 --> 10:33.917
Are you hurt?

10:34.211 --> 10:36.120
Are you in pain?

10:36.880 --> 10:39.122
I don't think he likes you much.

10:39.300 --> 10:42.254
Do you think you could
write down what's wrong?

10:42.427 --> 10:47.256
Is it your head? Chest? Stomach?
Oh, told you.

10:47.433 --> 10:51.597
- He's probably just hungry.
- Well, when was the last time you ate?

10:51.979 --> 10:54.102
Two days?

10:55.149 --> 10:58.483
- Two days.
- Yeah, I got that. Thanks.

10:58.653 --> 11:02.188
- Lap pad. And another.
- Fifteen knife wounds.

11:02.365 --> 11:06.030
- She must have pissed someone off.
- That's horrible. Bovie, pickups.

11:06.203 --> 11:09.157
Let me get something straight.
Someone chops this girl up...

11:09.330 --> 11:11.038
...and you take your time in the ER...

11:11.208 --> 11:13.699
...placing three horizontal mattresses
in the ventricle?

11:13.877 --> 11:15.501
It was a large defect.

11:15.671 --> 11:17.960
Foley balloon would've taken care of it.

11:18.090 --> 11:20.193
We still had to repair the myocardium.

11:20.228 --> 11:23.054
Exactly. While you were having
your little sewing bee...

11:23.089 --> 11:25.342
...I could have been repairing
the pulmonary artery.

11:25.514 --> 11:29.049
- I didn't appreciate that wound.
- Satinsky and more Prolene.

11:29.227 --> 11:32.476
So what's your excuse? Did you lose
a fortune in the stock market?

11:32.813 --> 11:35.435
- No.
- Cat run away?

11:35.608 --> 11:37.980
- How many units in?
- Just the six O-neg.

11:38.361 --> 11:40.484
You and the hubby still fighting?

11:43.115 --> 11:47.030
- Rumor mill is still churning out winners.
- I'm glad the gossip's so amusing.

11:47.204 --> 11:50.822
Army-Navy. So is this split
temporary or the real thing?

11:50.999 --> 11:52.328
I don't know.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.374
- You want my advice?
- Nope. Another clip.

11:54.545 --> 11:56.917
Stay away from love.
It does things to the brain.

11:58.382 --> 11:59.959
PVCs.

12:00.134 --> 12:02.707
- Hundred of lidocaine!
- Come on, Diana.

12:02.887 --> 12:05.555
So it's her nerves, right?
Nothing a Xanax won't cure?

12:05.723 --> 12:08.510
Actually, your transaminases are high.

12:08.642 --> 12:09.757
What's that mean?

12:09.935 --> 12:14.230
- You have pretty extensive liver damage.
- I don't drink at all.

12:14.816 --> 12:16.440
- Drugs?
- No.

12:16.901 --> 12:20.067
Have you had anything out of
the ordinary to eat the last few days?

12:20.238 --> 12:23.856
We had seared ahi last night,
pear salad.

12:24.409 --> 12:26.864
- Chanterelles.
- You ate our mushrooms?

12:27.037 --> 12:29.574
In my omelet. You weren't up yet.

12:29.705 --> 12:30.785
Where did you get them from?

12:31.124 --> 12:33.959
We picked them in Marin
a few months ago. I froze them.

12:35.504 --> 12:38.505
If they were bad mushrooms,
you could have amanita poisoning.

12:38.673 --> 12:39.954
And that causes liver damage?

12:40.092 --> 12:42.629
Extreme cases can result in liver failure.

12:42.803 --> 12:45.887
- What do you do for that?
- Don't want to get ahead of ourselves.

12:46.056 --> 12:49.721
But, worst-case scenario,
you'd need a transplant.

12:49.893 --> 12:52.728
- But I don't even feel that sick.
- It may not come to that.

12:53.564 --> 12:57.514
Do you have any relatives we can test
to see if they' re a match?

13:00.070 --> 13:01.778
- Do we know her name?
- Cops are on it.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.656
- Why didn't they tube her?
- Big, interior hematoma...

13:03.741 --> 13:05.726
...at the base of the neck.
Didn't want to take the chance.

13:05.961 --> 13:08.092
Female in her twenties,
stabbed at Hamden College.

13:08.227 --> 13:10.487
- Second one today.
- Found a knife at the scene.

13:10.665 --> 13:14.794
BP, 110/70. Stab wounds to the neck
and two deep ones by the sternum.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.705
- Was she in the dorm too?
- Science building.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.125
Police are searching the university.

13:18.298 --> 13:21.133
- Killing spree on campus.
- Remind me not to hang out there.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.970
Open a crike tray. Might need
to cut through this hematoma.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.924
Draw up 20 of etomidate
and 120 of sux.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.966
And I need a 7.5 tube.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.681
A wall collapsed at the school fire.
What can we take?

13:31.854 --> 13:35.139
- Three criticals, four minors.
- Okay, call Respiratory and ENT.

13:35.315 --> 13:39.645
Hang on, she's trying to say something.
Honey, can you tell us your name?

13:39.903 --> 13:42.822
Okay, suction ready.
Hold cricoid while we bag.

13:42.990 --> 13:46.823
- Pulse ox is coming up 96 percent.
- Probable mediastinal injury.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.450
- We'll have to triple-scope her.
- Oh, great.

13:49.914 --> 13:52.452
- Friend of yours?
- Could someone take him to Curtain 1?

13:52.833 --> 13:56.499
- Six hundred of clinda, 200 gentamicin.
- Meds are in.

13:56.671 --> 13:58.000
We should tube her, Kerry.

14:00.008 --> 14:02.582
Wait. What is it?

14:04.429 --> 14:06.950
I loved her.

14:12.988 --> 14:15.028
- Hey, where's my doctor?
- Oh, I don't know.

14:15.198 --> 14:18.487
- Can you tell her that I'm flying again?
- It's okay. Hold still.

14:18.660 --> 14:22.076
- This beats the patch any day.
- I thought women liked pirates.

14:22.247 --> 14:25.164
Yeah, 400 years ago, maybe.

14:25.333 --> 14:27.456
I was paged about
a possible liver transplant.

14:27.627 --> 14:32.253
Oh, right. The sister's here.
I thought both of us could talk to her.

14:32.424 --> 14:34.333
- Thanks, Susan.
- Yeah.

14:36.928 --> 14:38.636
- What's in New York?
- What?

14:38.805 --> 14:41.177
There were charges on our
Visa bill from New York.

14:41.349 --> 14:44.266
- Terry Welsh?
- Right down there by Curtain 3.

14:44.435 --> 14:47.306
- Fifty-two dollars from Saks?
- That's mine. It's a phone order.

14:47.480 --> 14:50.184
- Something you couldn't find in Chicago?
- Terry?

14:50.358 --> 14:53.274
Hi, sorry. I just got out of practice.

14:53.309 --> 14:56.618
That's okay. I'm Dr. Greene.
This is Dr. Corday. Thanks for coming.

14:56.821 --> 14:58.484
Paul said it was serious.

14:58.658 --> 15:01.279
Yes. Serious enough that
we should line up a donor.

15:01.452 --> 15:04.073
- Donor?
- Right in here.

15:05.789 --> 15:07.866
- Hi, Ter.
- Joanne?

15:08.042 --> 15:09.452
Your sister's doing okay now...

15:09.627 --> 15:12.462
...but we'd like to take the first step
and get blood drawn.

15:12.630 --> 15:16.710
- And have you sign the consent form.
- Consent for what?

15:17.134 --> 15:19.376
- You didn't fill her in?
- I thought Joanne should.

15:19.553 --> 15:22.305
- I might need a new liver.
- What?

15:22.473 --> 15:24.963
And my best shot for a match
is someone in the family.

15:25.142 --> 15:26.173
She's stage-three.

15:26.352 --> 15:29.138
Means she's well enough
to accept a living donor transplant.

15:29.313 --> 15:31.056
- Wait a second.
- We'd like to test,

15:31.190 --> 15:34.559
- ...see if you're a match.
- I have the Sweet Sixteen this weekend.

15:34.651 --> 15:36.810
- What?
- We beat Indiana on Thursday.

15:38.697 --> 15:41.698
- A game you obviously didn't watch.
- You play in a lot of games.

15:42.325 --> 15:45.991
- These are the playoffs, Joanne.
- There's not a lot of time. Right?

15:46.705 --> 15:50.488
- Sooner is definitely better.
- It's just part of the liver. It grows back.

15:50.667 --> 15:53.075
You donate the right lobe,
about 60 percent.

15:53.253 --> 15:56.752
Wait. Stop. Let me think.

15:56.923 --> 15:59.593
- What's to think about?
- No, you're right.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.429
We don't even know
if she's a match yet.

16:09.186 --> 16:12.804
Shelley? You should be lying down.

16:12.981 --> 16:16.730
- What's Renee doing here?
- You know this girl.

16:17.151 --> 16:19.986
Renee Carlson.
She's Diana's roommate.

16:21.781 --> 16:25.993
- She was badly injured.
- Was she stabbed like Diana?

16:26.619 --> 16:29.620
Are Renee and Diana close?

16:30.164 --> 16:33.000
No. She's quiet.

16:33.626 --> 16:37.078
Kind of weird. Diana's moving out
in a few weeks to come live with us.

16:39.048 --> 16:42.547
Where is Diana? Is she okay?

16:46.013 --> 16:47.922
Oh, my God.

16:48.558 --> 16:52.140
- She's not dead.
- I'm sorry.

16:56.107 --> 16:58.514
I called your house today, Martin.

16:58.692 --> 17:02.690
I know you can speak, because I heard
your voice on the answering machine.

17:03.739 --> 17:06.277
Why aren't you talking to me?

17:09.869 --> 17:11.578
What?

17:12.789 --> 17:17.037
I don't know what you're trying
to tell me. Why don't you just say it.

17:18.671 --> 17:23.083
Martin! Okay, stop playing games.
Tell me what's wrong.

17:23.258 --> 17:26.919
Look, we'll try supportive therapy.
But there are no guarantees.

17:27.095 --> 17:31.592
- She's started bleeding in her stomach.
- I'm a match, aren't I?

17:31.766 --> 17:36.142
- You wouldn't be explaining if I weren't.
- A transplant would be totally curative.

17:36.313 --> 17:39.931
- But there'd still be a risk for me, right?
- It would be minimal.

17:40.109 --> 17:42.813
Someone as healthy as you
should recover completely.

17:42.986 --> 17:47.398
- In three days?
- More like six weeks.

17:47.573 --> 17:50.361
I'm a senior. This is my first
and last time in the playoffs.

17:50.535 --> 17:54.778
- Can't she wait a month?
- She's already having complications.

17:55.456 --> 17:59.406
Pretend she didn't have a sister.
What would you do?

17:59.585 --> 18:03.418
Well, we'd be forced to put her
on a waiting list for a cadaveric donor.

18:03.965 --> 18:06.836
So there are other ways
she could get a liver.

18:07.593 --> 18:09.420
Terry, this is her best chance.

18:10.263 --> 18:14.343
Obviously it's your choice, but I'm sure
she'd do the same thing for you.

18:14.893 --> 18:17.597
No. She wouldn't.

18:21.482 --> 18:24.269
Run inside! Tell them we need
a collar and a backboard now!

18:24.443 --> 18:26.981
- I got hot water on me!
- Charlie, does your neck hurt?

18:27.155 --> 18:29.692
- Everything hurts.
- I need help here, somebody. Please!

18:29.865 --> 18:31.941
- You need help driving!
- What happened?

18:32.117 --> 18:34.075
The boy. Okay, Charlie.

18:34.245 --> 18:36.403
Stay still like a statue.
We're gonna move you.

18:36.580 --> 18:39.702
- Give me that. Get another backboard.
- He's not breathing.

18:39.737 --> 18:42.543
- Lie him down.
- He's been unconscious for 20 minutes.

18:42.778 --> 18:44.193
Why is he wet?

18:44.228 --> 18:45.956
He was taking a bath.
We stepped away.

18:46.132 --> 18:47.756
- He was underwater.
- For how long?

18:47.925 --> 18:49.669
Two minutes at the most.

18:50.010 --> 18:53.379
- We need the pulse ox. How old is he?
- He's 8. His name's Viktor.

18:53.555 --> 18:56.011
- Not moving much air.
- How could we let this happen?

18:56.183 --> 18:58.390
- He'll be okay, Linda.
- You his mom?

18:58.560 --> 18:59.935
- I am.
- I'm his doctor.

19:00.520 --> 19:04.019
- They called you first?
- Pulse ox, 85 on 15 liters.

19:04.191 --> 19:06.516
- Did you try to resuscitate him?
- No.

19:06.735 --> 19:09.570
- Take vitals?
- We thought it best to just come over.

19:12.699 --> 19:15.190
First-aid lab, EKG and a portable chest.
And an ABG.

19:15.368 --> 19:17.492
Follow the light. Need to see pupils.

19:17.521 --> 19:19.858
- My pupils aren't my problem.
- Titrate 10 of morphine.

19:19.948 --> 19:21.873
- Get him feeling better.
- Now you're talking.

19:22.042 --> 19:25.375
Circumferential burns to the elbows.
Trying to clear the neck.

19:25.546 --> 19:28.499
Trauma panel, dip a urine.
Get the SonoSite.

19:28.673 --> 19:30.880
- Dr. Corday?
- Yeah.

19:33.594 --> 19:38.221
Go ahead. Let's get a full scan
just to be safe. Head, C-spine, abdomen.

19:38.391 --> 19:41.309
Bag him. Draw up atropine,
etomidate and sux.

19:41.477 --> 19:43.471
Linda, Kyle, I recommend you step out.

19:43.605 --> 19:44.850
Orange zone on the Broselow.

19:45.022 --> 19:46.647
- We wanna stay with him.
- Not now.

19:46.816 --> 19:49.603
- I'm not leaving my son.
- He's not getting enough air.

19:49.777 --> 19:52.612
- 6-0 cuffed ET tube.
- He's gonna be okay, right?

19:52.864 --> 19:55.748
- Are you a medical doctor?
- Socialization therapist.

19:56.876 --> 19:59.033
Satting at 91.

19:59.746 --> 20:02.201
- Try a nasal trumpet.
- Felicia Kind.

20:02.373 --> 20:05.457
- Number three straight blade.
- Okay, sit down. Deep breath.

20:05.626 --> 20:07.833
You need to take that outside.

20:08.004 --> 20:10.672
Surgilube. Let's do a jaw thrust
and get a good seal.

20:10.840 --> 20:12.168
Sats at 92.

20:12.425 --> 20:14.916
- I should have called first.
- I'm glad you came over.

20:15.094 --> 20:18.427
We were on our way home from
baby gym class, and she just said it.

20:18.597 --> 20:21.052
Who's that? Who's that? Dada?

20:21.225 --> 20:23.134
- That's right.
- Dada.

20:23.310 --> 20:24.769
That's right. It's Dada.

20:24.937 --> 20:27.262
Why were three adults
giving an 8-year-old a bath?

20:27.439 --> 20:29.645
A bonding game. Recreating the womb.

20:29.775 --> 20:31.641
- I'm in.
- Holding your son underwater...

20:31.676 --> 20:32.872
bonds him to you?

20:33.045 --> 20:36.114
- It was only for short periods.
- Apparently not short enough.

20:36.490 --> 20:39.063
- Mark, you should get out there.
- Is something wrong?

20:39.243 --> 20:41.318
No. Ella has something to tell you.

20:41.495 --> 20:44.531
Tidal volume, 300. AC,
14 on 100 percent.

20:44.706 --> 20:48.621
Get a blood gas in 20 minutes.
I'll be right outside.

20:49.336 --> 20:52.336
- Hey, you deserted me.
- I did nothing of the sort, Charlie.

20:52.506 --> 20:56.088
- You're in perfectly good hands.
- She never buys from me.

20:56.259 --> 20:57.338
You're overpriced.

20:57.510 --> 21:00.180
Dr. Weaver,
Renee Carlson's mom is here.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.423
- Is there anything on the firefighters?
- No.

21:02.807 --> 21:04.550
Repeat the hematocrit in one hour...

21:04.726 --> 21:07.514
...and send the O-neg back
to the blood bank.

21:09.356 --> 21:12.807
Mrs. Carlson, I'm Dr. Weaver.
I'm treating Renee.

21:12.984 --> 21:16.934
Hi. They called me at work.
They told me she got hurt at school.

21:17.113 --> 21:19.604
I thought she twisted an ankle
or something.

21:19.783 --> 21:21.692
Your daughter
has multiple knife wounds...

21:21.867 --> 21:24.905
...including a deep cut
across her throat.

21:25.079 --> 21:27.749
- You saved her?
- We were able to repair the wounds...

21:27.916 --> 21:28.947
...and she's stable.

21:29.125 --> 21:32.660
But we had to put a tube
down her throat to help her breathe.

21:34.714 --> 21:40.169
- When will she wake up?
- It's hard to say. We'll just have to wait.

21:41.179 --> 21:44.133
She hasn't been in the hospital
since she was born.

21:44.306 --> 21:47.971
We need to get her up
to the intensive care unit.

21:49.686 --> 21:52.522
The police said her friend Diana
was attacked too.

21:52.690 --> 21:54.232
Yes.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.728
Is she okay?

21:55.901 --> 21:58.787
Diana's injuries were
much more extensive.

21:58.921 --> 22:00.864
We were unable to save her.

22:08.873 --> 22:12.039
Has Renee been having
any problems at school?

22:12.751 --> 22:14.031
No.

22:14.211 --> 22:17.331
Has she been depressed
or showing any signs of-?

22:17.505 --> 22:19.499
No. Why are you asking this?

22:20.383 --> 22:22.507
We're just trying to understand
what happened.

22:23.095 --> 22:26.298
Someone attacked my daughter
and her friend.

22:26.932 --> 22:31.309
That's what happened. Why is everyone
asking all these questions?

22:32.187 --> 22:38.057
Diana had defensive wounds
on her hands and her arms. Renee didn't.

22:39.277 --> 22:41.354
So what?

22:43.073 --> 22:46.157
My daughter didn't hurt her friend.

22:47.327 --> 22:52.369
And she certainly did not
do this to herself.

22:52.540 --> 22:55.577
There must be a maniac out there.

22:56.628 --> 23:00.542
I'm sure Renee will tell us what
happened as soon as she wakes up.

23:00.715 --> 23:04.214
That's right. She'll tell you.

23:04.761 --> 23:07.430
She and Diana were best friends.

23:10.182 --> 23:13.551
Viktor's stable. He's breathing
with the help of a machine.

23:13.727 --> 23:15.435
Will he wake up?

23:15.605 --> 23:19.104
We hope we see some progress
in the next 24 hours.

23:19.275 --> 23:21.018
A social worker's on her way down.

23:21.193 --> 23:23.649
Why do we need a social worker?

23:25.031 --> 23:27.107
- Wait, let me explain.
- I got the gist of it.

23:27.283 --> 23:30.284
We adopted Viktor in Prague last year.
We were thrilled.

23:30.452 --> 23:33.537
- But he hasn't connected with us.
- Love and time usually does it.

23:33.706 --> 23:36.742
It was putting a strain on our marriage.
Felicia's helping us.

23:36.918 --> 23:39.872
You put your son in a lot of danger.

23:40.046 --> 23:43.960
If he needs counseling, or you do,
go to a real doctor.

23:44.133 --> 23:48.711
- Her success rate is 85 percent.
- Excuse me.

23:49.388 --> 23:52.711
- What, no geese?
- A flock of ducks walked down the hall.

23:52.746 --> 23:54.009
He's seeing birds.

23:54.101 --> 23:56.770
Please, Stan. You told me
you saw butterflies earlier.

23:56.895 --> 23:59.137
- Pink elephants.
- They weren't pink.

23:59.231 --> 24:02.148
They were psychedelic
and pretty as Natalie Wood.

24:02.317 --> 24:04.939
- Have you seen Dr. Greene?
- He checked out for an hour.

24:05.112 --> 24:06.310
- Where to?
- Don't know.

24:06.489 --> 24:08.694
But Dr. Lewis is covering for him.

24:10.408 --> 24:12.982
- Where are you going?
- I have a 5-day-old with listeria.

24:13.161 --> 24:14.573
- Where are the eggs?
- What eggs?

24:14.746 --> 24:16.324
Susan, I need a favor.

24:16.498 --> 24:19.452
Yeah, sure.
Can you take this to Exam 4?

24:21.211 --> 24:25.920
This is a bit awkward, but I need
to know where my husband is.

24:26.090 --> 24:28.130
- I don't know.
- You're covering his patients.

24:28.301 --> 24:30.092
- Yeah, but- I'm sorry.
- Please tell me.

24:30.262 --> 24:34.307
I know there's something going on.
I don't think I deserve to be in the dark.

24:34.474 --> 24:36.799
- He is my husband.
- You need to talk to him.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.636
Susan.

24:42.023 --> 24:44.067
Elizabeth, think about it.

24:44.859 --> 24:48.560
What would be going on
that he wouldn't want to tell you?

24:49.196 --> 24:51.403
That he'd try to protect you from?

25:15.139 --> 25:18.590
Excuse me. I'm looking for my husband,
Mark Greene.

25:20.311 --> 25:21.721
He just started his treatment.

25:31.781 --> 25:35.065
- Can you take me to him, please?
- Sure.

25:35.242 --> 25:38.113
I just pre-medicated with
the antiemetic, ondansetron.

25:38.287 --> 25:41.869
The Decadron runs in over 15 minutes
as an IV piggyback.

25:42.041 --> 25:45.077
Once that's in, I'll be back
to inject vincristine.

25:45.252 --> 25:48.419
He's also getting procarbazine
and CCNU.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.174
Right through there.

26:13.031 --> 26:17.029
- Were you knocked out?
- No. But I was pinned pretty good.

26:17.201 --> 26:19.360
Full trauma panel, C-spine, chest, pelvis.

26:19.495 --> 26:21.487
- School fire?
- It's a bad one.

26:21.623 --> 26:24.492
Contusions and abrasions to mid-thigh.

26:24.667 --> 26:28.830
- Can you wiggle your toes for me?
- Good breath sounds.

26:29.004 --> 26:31.674
Follow my finger.
Did you get everyone out?

26:31.840 --> 26:33.215
One kid unaccounted for.

26:33.584 --> 26:36.005
We were looking for him
when the floor above us collapsed.

26:36.178 --> 26:37.886
- Who's we?
- About six of us.

26:38.055 --> 26:40.012
Pedal pulses, two-plus bilaterally.

26:40.182 --> 26:42.637
They vented the roof
and half the main wall fell in.

26:42.810 --> 26:46.260
- Did you get all your guys out safe?
- Still looking for three when I left.

26:46.438 --> 26:50.387
- Hanson, Jeffries and Lopez.
- Sandy Lopez?

26:50.567 --> 26:52.060
She was the first one in.

26:56.739 --> 27:00.950
- What about gamma radiation?
- Didn't work. Tumor's still growing.

27:01.119 --> 27:03.111
Should we call Dr. Burke?

27:03.245 --> 27:04.574
- Maybe he...
- I saw him.

27:05.414 --> 27:07.205
In New York.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.081
How much time?

27:19.928 --> 27:23.095
If this works, 10 months.

27:30.439 --> 27:32.182
Why didn't you tell me?

27:34.150 --> 27:35.810
I don't know.

27:40.740 --> 27:43.313
- I guess it was bad timing.
- I could have helped.

27:43.493 --> 27:45.034
How?

27:51.083 --> 27:53.787
- You shouldn't be alone.
- This doesn't change anything.

27:53.961 --> 27:57.127
- It does. It changes everything.
- I don't expect you to come back...

27:57.297 --> 27:59.836
...just because this happened.

28:18.735 --> 28:22.898
Let me know
if Perotti goes to the O.R.

28:23.072 --> 28:26.238
- I'm pretty sure it's an appy.
- What, you're going back to work?

28:28.577 --> 28:30.201
I don't know what else to do.

28:34.708 --> 28:37.709
I've débrided the forearms.
She needs Thermazine and burn-net.

28:37.877 --> 28:40.878
- And I promised her three stickers.
- Mermaids or horses?

28:41.048 --> 28:43.585
Three liters of Ringer's, 20 of morphine.

28:43.716 --> 28:45.294
- You got it.
- Going to the burn unit?

28:45.427 --> 28:47.633
Yeah, third one today. The last bed.

28:47.804 --> 28:50.259
Urine output was 250 cc's last hour.

28:50.389 --> 28:53.094
- There's your new boyfriend.
- What? Oh, poor guy.

28:53.184 --> 28:55.889
- He's a little on the simple side.
- You think?

28:56.062 --> 29:00.439
Martin, did you talk to the lady
from Psych?

29:02.109 --> 29:04.647
That doesn't mean anything to me.

29:06.863 --> 29:09.402
Okay,
a scarf doesn't mean much either.

29:10.200 --> 29:12.572
I don't get it, okay?

29:14.955 --> 29:19.201
Did someone knit you the set?
Something happened to that person.

29:22.212 --> 29:25.415
Two days ago,
when you stopped talking.

29:26.925 --> 29:30.756
Danny Barnett, found on the scene
at the fire. No obvious burns or injuries.

29:30.928 --> 29:34.048
People were very worried about you,
Danny. Where were you?

29:34.223 --> 29:36.893
- Cafeteria.
- How are his sats?

29:37.060 --> 29:41.223
- Ninety-nine on room air.
- Did you breathe in any smoke, Danny?

29:41.397 --> 29:45.061
No, I told the fire lady I'm not hurt.
She still made me come.

29:45.234 --> 29:49.905
- Is the fire lady here with you now?
- She rode in the ambulance with me.

29:50.072 --> 29:52.824
- Maybe they took her home.
- And was she hurt?

29:53.241 --> 29:55.733
Don't think so. She was telling jokes.

29:55.869 --> 29:58.704
Okay, I'll be right back, Danny, okay?

29:58.872 --> 30:03.866
Jerry, call the 38. Verify that all
their firefighters are accounted for.

30:04.044 --> 30:07.329
- They're probably still busy with the fire.
- Just do it.

30:20.684 --> 30:23.175
- You need to start wearing shoes.
- Where's Dr. Greene?

30:23.353 --> 30:25.385
- He'll be back in a bit.
- Know where he went?

30:25.420 --> 30:26.434
What do you need?

30:26.469 --> 30:28.224
Complex laceration through the helix.

30:28.400 --> 30:30.607
- He was gonna walk me through it.
- I'll do it.

30:30.777 --> 30:32.854
- Yeah? Suture Room.
- What's that?

30:33.030 --> 30:35.603
It's a lighter.
Scoped it out of some kid's belly.

30:35.783 --> 30:37.691
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Keep it.

30:37.867 --> 30:40.074
- Why?
- Behold Dr. Carter's...

30:40.161 --> 30:41.656
...box of wonders.

30:41.830 --> 30:43.952
You've scoped all that stuff
out of patients?

30:44.124 --> 30:46.697
I like to think of it
as gastrointestinal bric-a-brac.

30:46.876 --> 30:50.043
Hey, is that my good pen?

30:51.756 --> 30:54.329
I can't believe you pulled this out
of someone's stomach.

30:54.508 --> 30:57.178
- Other end.
- Keep it.

31:08.814 --> 31:10.474
Here.

31:11.817 --> 31:13.856
- You didn't sign it.
- I know.

31:14.028 --> 31:16.067
Terry, where are you going?

31:16.405 --> 31:17.650
Back to practice.

31:17.822 --> 31:19.566
What about Joanne?

31:19.741 --> 31:22.315
Joanne's never had time
for anyone but Joanne.

31:22.494 --> 31:24.866
That's still no reason not to help her.

31:25.037 --> 31:27.493
- We're not close.
- She's still your sister!

31:27.665 --> 31:31.368
I know I should be a bigger person,
but I've trained for this my whole life.

31:31.544 --> 31:33.204
I'm not willing to sacrifice that.

31:33.671 --> 31:37.503
If that makes me a selfish,
terrible person, I'm sorry.

31:38.759 --> 31:41.962
Maybe I'll help Joanne afterwards,
but not right now.

32:24.678 --> 32:26.422
Hiding out, are you? Do me a favor,

32:26.555 --> 32:28.762
Just go down there
when those idiots page you.

32:28.932 --> 32:32.016
They're like crazed cyborgs,
paging every five minutes...

32:32.185 --> 32:34.937
...until they somehow manage to find
your fearless leader...

32:35.104 --> 32:37.561
...and suck us all into their universe.

32:39.484 --> 32:43.351
Oh, what happened?
Prince Harry in rehab again?

32:46.491 --> 32:48.863
Mark's tumor's back.

32:53.164 --> 32:55.322
Has it invaded Broca's?

32:57.084 --> 32:59.575
It's encroaching the motor cortex.

33:11.932 --> 33:13.592
I'm sorry.

33:17.521 --> 33:19.928
It was always a possibility.

33:22.692 --> 33:25.977
He's known about it for weeks.
He just didn't tell me.

33:29.115 --> 33:30.609
Well...

33:34.620 --> 33:37.657
Maybe he was protecting you.

33:40.375 --> 33:43.460
There's so much
we haven't worked out.

33:51.637 --> 33:54.423
I don't think
I can go through this again.

33:56.433 --> 33:59.968
I'm sick and tired
of being the strong one.

34:00.144 --> 34:04.473
You know, we've broken up.
We've grown apart.

34:05.524 --> 34:08.312
He doesn't even expect me
to be there, anyway.

34:13.239 --> 34:14.983
What am I supposed to do?

34:15.158 --> 34:18.658
Am I supposed to just
go back home to watch him die?

34:22.291 --> 34:24.164
Yes.

34:27.379 --> 34:29.418
Well, I don't think I can.

34:34.552 --> 34:35.833
Is he your husband?

34:42.143 --> 34:43.685
Yes.

34:45.020 --> 34:46.893
Do you love him?

34:52.527 --> 34:53.806
Yes.

35:00.996 --> 35:03.120
The police found his mom
on the bathroom floor.

35:03.291 --> 35:05.962
- They think it was a heart attack.
- Does he live with her?

35:06.129 --> 35:08.039
Yeah, I think
it's a conversion disorder...

35:08.216 --> 35:10.375
...brought on by the stress
of finding her dead.

35:10.552 --> 35:12.131
Does he have any other family?

35:12.305 --> 35:14.880
Yeah, there's a sister coming in
from Louisville.

35:15.060 --> 35:16.970
And Psych said they'd hold him
until then.

35:17.146 --> 35:19.056
- I'm gonna go visit him.
- Okay.

35:20.652 --> 35:23.440
- Viktor Evans' parents?
- Trauma 1.

35:29.833 --> 35:32.586
How much do you charge for therapy?

35:33.172 --> 35:34.583
- Went a little too far this time.
- Too far?

35:34.757 --> 35:38.673
You deprived that boy's brain
of oxygen.

35:39.473 --> 35:41.384
- He'll pull through.
- How would you know?

35:41.559 --> 35:43.849
- I have a feeling.
- Feeling.

35:44.022 --> 35:47.143
If you call yourself a doctor,
you should be able to back it up.

35:47.318 --> 35:50.606
Before I started working with Viktor
he could barely crack a smile...

35:50.782 --> 35:52.990
...let alone acknowledge
his adoptive parents.

35:53.161 --> 35:56.034
Now he's calling them
Mommy and Daddy.

35:56.374 --> 35:58.914
Dr. Greene, he's having
purposeful movements.

35:59.087 --> 36:01.580
Don't worry, honey. Mommy's here.
Is he okay?

36:01.758 --> 36:03.716
Viktor, can you hear me?

36:04.304 --> 36:06.297
Try and grab my fingers.

36:06.474 --> 36:09.262
- Good grip strength bilaterally.
- We're in the clear.

36:09.437 --> 36:11.229
Check the weaning parameters.

36:11.398 --> 36:14.152
Viktor, you have a tube in your throat,
so you can't talk.

36:14.486 --> 36:17.240
- Welcome back, champ.
- We'll take it out as soon as we can.

36:19.745 --> 36:22.533
- Look.
- This may have been a breakthrough day.

36:22.916 --> 36:26.018
- You think?
- Absolutely. He's engaging with you.

36:26.242 --> 36:29.049
- You're kidding, right?
- We have other methods we can try.

36:29.218 --> 36:31.011
Not if you intend on keeping Viktor.

36:31.179 --> 36:34.849
What you did today was abusive,
not loving.

36:34.928 --> 36:36.972
Radical problems need radical therapies.

36:37.106 --> 36:39.147
Tell that to Child Protective Services.

36:39.317 --> 36:41.109
They'll be making a home visit.

36:41.279 --> 36:43.605
You okay, Dr. Greene?

36:45.119 --> 36:47.195
I gotta go.

36:48.666 --> 36:50.291
What's Stan still doing here?

36:50.460 --> 36:52.620
I told him he could stay
if he sang quietly.

36:52.797 --> 36:54.625
At least it's not Oklahoma! tonight.

36:54.800 --> 36:57.756
- Thank God for small favors.
- And he's off the birds.

36:57.930 --> 37:00.600
Can you call
for Stewart's pelvic CT results?

37:00.768 --> 37:02.678
Check the second troponin on Lang.

37:03.647 --> 37:06.603
All right. Mark,
you haven't written up your H & P's.

37:06.778 --> 37:09.982
- I'll do that on my next shift.
- Yeah, well, this shift isn't over.

37:10.158 --> 37:12.697
I just had my first round
of chemotherapy, Kerry.

37:12.870 --> 37:16.787
I feel like hell.
I'm gonna go home early, okay?

37:25.265 --> 37:29.846
Hey. What's the expression?
"Couch tomato"?

37:30.815 --> 37:33.604
"Potato. " And I'm at the table.

37:33.778 --> 37:35.522
I should buy a new comforter.

37:35.698 --> 37:39.698
Don't do it on my account.
A girl named Michelle called for you.

37:40.372 --> 37:42.033
Oh, I forgot.

37:43.961 --> 37:46.454
You're taking her to the Ice-Capades?

37:46.632 --> 37:49.421
- What's wrong with that?
- Nothing.

37:49.595 --> 37:51.921
I tried to explain
that I was just your roommate.

37:52.099 --> 37:53.891
I'm not sure if I like her, anyway.

37:58.776 --> 38:01.695
- Is this the last one?
- No, there's a couple more in there.

38:08.249 --> 38:09.530
Any luck?

38:11.629 --> 38:12.710
Yes, here's one.

38:12.881 --> 38:15.671
Two bedroom, one bath,
hardwood floors, breakfast nook.

38:15.845 --> 38:17.969
- Sounds big.
- Has a doorman.

38:18.140 --> 38:20.134
- Safe.
- And a lake view.

38:21.562 --> 38:23.354
- How much?
- This one's only twice what I can afford.

38:23.482 --> 38:27.482
I'm gonna jump in the shower.

38:27.654 --> 38:29.898
Yeah, you don't wanna keep
Tai and Randy waiting.

38:46.225 --> 38:48.385
This latte blows.

38:48.563 --> 38:51.316
Weaver said Charlie won't be on his feet
until next week.

38:51.484 --> 38:55.698
Then I'm in trouble,
because this cafeteria stuff is criminal.

38:56.450 --> 38:58.528
I heard about Mark Greene.

39:00.540 --> 39:04.754
- Tough to keep a secret around here.
- You did.

39:04.922 --> 39:06.298
So that night, you were...?

39:09.262 --> 39:12.598
What can I say? I'm passionate.

39:12.768 --> 39:15.724
You spent the night together,
and I thought...

39:16.023 --> 39:19.643
- You have a very active imagination.
- If you only knew.

39:19.820 --> 39:22.574
- You are not flirting with me.
- No way.

39:22.742 --> 39:25.116
I'm never gonna make that mistake
again.

39:25.287 --> 39:27.958
- Back in uniform.
- Isn't your head cold?

39:28.126 --> 39:31.911
- No, no, I got thick hair.
- What are you hiding?

39:32.090 --> 39:33.834
- Nothing.
- What are you hiding?

39:34.009 --> 39:37.131
- What do you got there, Gallant?
- What do you got in there?

39:38.600 --> 39:41.388
- Oh, look at that.
- Oh, can I hold one?

39:41.563 --> 39:42.939
Sure.

39:43.399 --> 39:45.974
So cute.

39:48.867 --> 39:50.611
Sorry.

39:59.133 --> 40:00.758
Hey.

40:01.428 --> 40:03.256
Out barhopping?

40:03.430 --> 40:07.051
- I was just...
- Lost?

40:07.228 --> 40:08.474
Looking for you.

40:09.483 --> 40:11.227
And you only found my car.

40:13.864 --> 40:17.282
It was great what you did
for that kid today.

40:18.037 --> 40:21.040
Part of the job. The good part,
when the fire doesn't get you.

40:21.459 --> 40:24.462
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- No, I'm back at 7.

40:24.964 --> 40:28.751
You know what? You can't drive.

40:29.389 --> 40:31.299
Kerry, come on.

40:34.105 --> 40:37.725
You were missing. I was worried.

40:40.865 --> 40:42.657
I'm touched.

40:44.328 --> 40:48.625
You were right.
You did do me a favor.

40:57.182 --> 41:00.019
Come to think of it,
it was a pretty cool save.

41:00.187 --> 41:03.523
Fire went to three alarms.
I couldn't see my hand in front of my-

41:41.127 --> 41:43.416
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:45.634 --> 41:49.088
- Where's your dad?
- Upstairs.

41:49.264 --> 41:50.546
He didn't feel well.

41:55.524 --> 41:56.854
Would you like to take Ella?

41:59.280 --> 42:01.488
- Hey.
- There's Rach.

42:01.659 --> 42:03.452
Hi.

42:07.167 --> 42:08.960
Thank you.

42:13.469 --> 42:14.750
He's sick again, isn't he?

42:35.880 --> 42:38.169
How long have you been like this?

42:39.343 --> 42:40.922
Forever.

42:41.430 --> 42:43.803
Don't they say if it makes you sick
it's working?

42:44.184 --> 42:47.637
It's cold comfort when you're lying
on the bathroom floor.

42:48.358 --> 42:51.894
- You want some Compazine?
- I took some an hour ago.

42:54.033 --> 42:57.369
Here.
Let me put this on your forehead.

43:07.722 --> 43:11.852
You know, I tried for weeks
to get her to say "Mama" and "moon."

43:12.896 --> 43:18.653
- They always say "Dada" first.
- That's just because it's easy to say.

43:19.448 --> 43:20.729
Maybe she likes me.

43:21.911 --> 43:23.738
She's a good judge of character.

43:27.044 --> 43:29.797
Here. I'm gonna go out
and get some Zofran.

43:29.965 --> 43:32.292
No, no, no. Stay. Stay.

43:32.761 --> 43:34.667
It'll pass.
