00:10.747 --> 00:12.605
<i>My name is Detective Brett Hopper</i>

00:13.421 --> 00:15.600
<i>And this is the day
that changes everything...</i>

00:16.081 --> 00:16.996
Freeze! Your hands up!

00:17.021 --> 00:19.521
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant DA Alberto Garza.

00:19.580 --> 00:20.974
<i>I will be framed for murder...</i>

00:21.991 --> 00:23.452
Who the hell are you people ?

00:23.936 --> 00:25.764
<i>My girlfriend Rita will be in danger.</i>

00:26.286 --> 00:29.082
<i>I know all this because I am living
the same day,</i>

00:29.675 --> 00:31.385
<i>over and over again.</i>

00:31.439 --> 00:34.157
The day is the same,
but different things happen.

00:34.375 --> 00:36.446
I thought it'd be different this time.
Didn't you?

00:37.442 --> 00:40.540
We taste the same!
We all taste just like chicken!

00:40.570 --> 00:41.957
<i>Every day I get another chance.</i>

00:41.968 --> 00:43.987
For every decision,
there's a consequence.

00:44.007 --> 00:45.900
<i>Before he died, Garza sent me evidence</i>

00:45.901 --> 00:48.188
<i>for an old murder case,
one my father worked on.</i>

00:48.189 --> 00:49.776
<i>This girl can lead me to the truth.</i>

00:49.777 --> 00:52.428
<i>Mr. Detweiler got Isabella the job.</i>

00:52.623 --> 00:54.310
<i>And I thought I found the guy behind it.</i>

00:54.362 --> 00:56.426
I wanna know why the hell
you're doing this to me.

00:56.595 --> 00:58.052
<i>But he works for someone else.</i>

00:58.106 --> 01:00.440
<i>I don't know who,
but I have his license plate.</i>

01:00.588 --> 01:02.147
<i>How the hell shall I proceed?</i>

01:02.527 --> 01:03.468
Kill them all.

01:03.871 --> 01:06.131
<i>Now, I have to find out who he is.</i>

01:19.288 --> 01:20.405
Somebody's tense.

01:23.781 --> 01:25.151
Scratch your face.

01:25.793 --> 01:27.509
Are you growing a beard or something?

01:28.995 --> 01:31.563
No, I guess I haven't had time to shave.

01:31.997 --> 01:33.597
I thought you shaved it yesterday.

01:38.424 --> 01:39.387
What happened, here?

01:42.095 --> 01:43.065
Nothing.

01:46.547 --> 01:47.805
Did I say something wrong?

01:48.477 --> 01:51.507
Sometimes, I just can't take
the same questions, you know ?

01:53.647 --> 01:55.357
If you wanna grow a full beard,

01:55.732 --> 01:57.291
it's fine by me. Bring it on!

02:01.542 --> 02:03.289
Baby, what's going on with you?

02:04.340 --> 02:05.328
Come on, tell me.

02:06.650 --> 02:08.485
<i>You wanna tell me about it?
What's going on?</i>

02:08.512 --> 02:09.967
<i>Why is this happening?</i>

02:10.059 --> 02:12.025
<i>I just wanna know what happened
to the man...</i>

02:12.106 --> 02:14.077
<i>There's a lot
you're not telling me.</i>

02:14.295 --> 02:15.474
I just feel stuck.

02:17.179 --> 02:18.149
Stuck?

02:19.174 --> 02:21.256
- What, like... with us?
- With everything.

02:21.814 --> 02:23.884
Well, last time I checked,
I'm part of everything.

02:23.885 --> 02:26.099
- Is not you, okay?
-Okay. So what is it?

02:26.400 --> 02:27.369
Fine!

02:27.907 --> 02:30.115
I thought I found the bad guy
in this case I'm working.

02:30.136 --> 02:32.424
But it turns out he works
for somebody that's even worse.

02:32.459 --> 02:33.940
And I don't know who is he,

02:33.941 --> 02:36.343
what he looks like
and I don't know his name.

02:36.426 --> 02:38.004
All I got is a licence plate number.

02:38.954 --> 02:39.937
But it's not you.

02:40.671 --> 02:44.067
This is something
I gotta figure out by myself.

02:59.621 --> 03:00.922
<i>They're not going to be happy.</i>

03:00.923 --> 03:02.724
<i>You allowed Hopper
to make contact with you.</i>

03:02.725 --> 03:04.533
<i>He knows much more
than he's letting off.</i>

03:05.021 --> 03:07.135
Oh yes, this is Detective Choi.

03:07.586 --> 03:09.530
I need you to run
a licence plate for me, please.

03:09.556 --> 03:11.106
1-E-4-9-9-0-8.

03:11.244 --> 03:13.008
Do you have an address on that?

03:41.507 --> 03:44.685
- Excuse me, can I ask you a question?
- Deliveries are around back.

03:45.448 --> 03:46.601
Let's do this one more time.

03:46.744 --> 03:47.820
I have a question.

03:48.541 --> 03:49.992
Those cars out front, who uses them?

03:50.151 --> 03:52.260
All of the cars are licenced
to the Santayana Club

03:52.443 --> 03:53.924
for the exclusive use of our members.

03:53.925 --> 03:56.081
Well, I'm interested
in Conrad Detweiler.

03:56.942 --> 03:57.957
Who drives him?

03:58.404 --> 04:01.027
This is a private club, sir.
I'm afraid I can't divulge that info...

04:01.028 --> 04:02.025
Can't or won't ?

04:02.255 --> 04:05.138
The director of operations
handles all tranportation matters.

04:05.321 --> 04:06.335
If you'll excuse me.

04:09.958 --> 04:10.950
Punk!

04:15.588 --> 04:16.577
Excuse me, sir.

04:16.635 --> 04:17.946
Lloyd, please.

04:18.209 --> 04:20.873
Okay. Lloyd, I need to know
where the director's office is, please.

04:21.283 --> 04:22.557
You a new member, sir?

04:23.253 --> 04:25.874
Yeah. I'm planning on joining.
I just need one of these guys

04:26.197 --> 04:27.239
to sponsor me.

04:27.329 --> 04:29.002
Do that and your first drink's on me.

04:30.553 --> 04:32.402
Director's office is to the left.

04:41.797 --> 04:43.787
<i>I got you one of the best
criminal defense attorney</i>

04:43.823 --> 04:44.957
<i>in the state. Barry Coldburn.</i>

04:45.075 --> 04:46.038
Can I help you?

04:46.785 --> 04:47.761
I hope not.

04:50.268 --> 04:52.958
<i>Terry, report. I want your status.
Have you stopped the suspect?</i>

04:53.018 --> 04:54.499
Soltis, hallway is clear.

04:55.882 --> 04:57.561
I don't see this guy anywhere.

05:31.975 --> 05:33.659
Excuse me, what are you doing in here?

05:33.723 --> 05:35.532
Sir, I'm detective Brett Hopper.

05:35.743 --> 05:38.202
- If you have a moment, I'd like--
- I'm so sorry, detective.

05:38.351 --> 05:41.639
You are in the wrong place, everyone
else is upstairs in the dinner room.

05:43.356 --> 05:45.508
Did you see anyone else in my office?

05:45.608 --> 05:46.625
No, should I have?

05:47.219 --> 05:49.488
Everything this morning has been
so unexpected.

05:49.578 --> 05:52.095
You never know
what you're gonna wake up to.

06:01.787 --> 06:02.796
It's him.

06:03.210 --> 06:04.926
That's the man that killed my husband.

06:08.492 --> 06:10.721
Stay with Mrs Garza.
The uniforms come with me!

06:17.737 --> 06:19.204
Emergency exit is that way.

06:21.559 --> 06:22.658
Gosh...

06:38.517 --> 06:40.840
<i>We all taste just like chicken!</i>

06:41.432 --> 06:42.517
That was different.

06:45.450 --> 06:46.350
+

06:50.618 --> 06:51.618
It's you!

06:53.246 --> 06:54.227
You okay?

06:56.551 --> 06:58.352
I take your call again!

07:02.667 --> 07:04.009
Stop running now!

07:12.911 --> 07:14.910
Hey, that's our guy, get him!

07:18.485 --> 07:20.656
- Spivak. <i>
- Mrs Garza IDed Hopper.</i>

07:21.060 --> 07:22.853
She did that last night, dude.

07:22.978 --> 07:25.783
No, she did it in person.
Hopper was here, at the club.

07:25.922 --> 07:28.201
- What he was doing there?
<i>- I didn't have time to ask.</i>

07:28.232 --> 07:30.844
Look, he got away but we have
his truck so he's not going far.

07:30.958 --> 07:33.617
Get Mrs Garza down here.
I want her under protective custody.

07:33.653 --> 07:35.271
Do you think
Hopper wanted to get to her?

07:35.335 --> 07:37.756
She's the only eye witness.
What do you think?

07:37.901 --> 07:40.008
Set a perimeter.
I get more uniforms down there.

07:40.062 --> 07:41.026
Already on it.

08:04.560 --> 08:07.090
So is Shelten getting
his back waxed in there or what?

08:07.215 --> 08:10.079
The sergeant will see you
when he's ready.

08:10.196 --> 08:12.162
Just saying I got a Vietnamese girl

08:12.163 --> 08:14.329
who can get him speed already
in under 20 minutes.

08:17.735 --> 08:18.694
What?

08:19.708 --> 08:21.508
You haven't eard yet, have you?

08:25.407 --> 08:26.398
Heard what?

08:26.943 --> 08:28.140
About your partner...

08:28.933 --> 08:32.336
You know Hopper's wanted
for de Garza's murder, right?

08:33.299 --> 08:34.832
What are you talking about?

08:35.399 --> 08:36.357
What murder?

08:39.702 --> 08:40.933
You got to get that?

08:50.989 --> 08:52.583
Come on, come on.

08:54.931 --> 08:56.593
If they think by keeping me here
all day,

08:56.599 --> 08:58.298
that's gonna change my story,
they're wrong.

08:58.298 --> 09:01.067
I know it's rough. These guys
can't afford to make any mistakes.

09:01.099 --> 09:04.264
- There was so many eyes watching.
- Brett was with me all night, Chad.

09:04.317 --> 09:06.362
There's no way
he could have killed anyone.

09:06.456 --> 09:07.437
I know...

09:08.501 --> 09:10.895
But I've heard
they have conflicting testimony.

09:11.176 --> 09:12.995
What? From who?

09:21.206 --> 09:24.060
- Who is that?
- This none of your damned business.

09:25.014 --> 09:27.338
- What's this?
- A search warrant.

09:27.582 --> 09:29.121
For Ms Shelton apartment.

09:30.884 --> 09:33.532
I don't care how sick this kid is!

09:33.604 --> 09:35.692
Fire him! Yes, today!

09:35.746 --> 09:37.557
Police business, I need this laptop.

09:40.114 --> 09:41.079
Sit down!

10:00.362 --> 10:03.321
There you are...
Now let's see who you hang out with.

10:04.955 --> 10:05.936
Don't !

10:07.064 --> 10:09.686
Trust me, you don't wanna be found dead,
man.

10:16.845 --> 10:19.871
How did you guys manage to find me
without your little tracking device ?

10:21.190 --> 10:22.528
Let me guess, now we're gonna take

10:22.577 --> 10:24.446
a little trip to the quarry
to visit Detweiler.

10:24.491 --> 10:26.067
Oh aren't you the shady paddy?

10:26.893 --> 10:28.702
Don't even think about...

10:33.821 --> 10:35.525
Don't kill me! Please!

10:42.870 --> 10:43.590
+

10:52.153 --> 10:53.935
- Yeah?
- Hopper, where the hell are you?

10:53.936 --> 10:55.365
<i>Believe me, you don't wanna know.</i>

10:55.366 --> 10:57.174
What if other people wanna know?

10:57.187 --> 10:59.534
Their hust saying you tried
to kill Ms Garza at some club...

10:59.561 --> 11:02.053
Well, that's not what happened.
I didn't even know she was there.

11:02.054 --> 11:05.305
I went looking for a list of suspects
of people who framed me, Andrea.

11:05.521 --> 11:07.090
I don't know what you're talking about.

11:07.198 --> 11:09.620
But they have half the force out there
looking for you.

11:10.083 --> 11:12.540
Word is, you killed
two ex-deputies.

11:13.490 --> 11:14.460
What?

11:14.866 --> 11:16.322
You said they were two ex-cops?

11:16.486 --> 11:17.495
<i>Focus, Hopper!</i>

11:17.496 --> 11:18.487
Tell me what happened.

11:18.532 --> 11:20.392
They threatened me,
but I did not shoot them.

11:20.437 --> 11:21.500
Well, who the hell did?

11:21.501 --> 11:23.833
There was someone on the top
of the building on the roof top.

11:23.997 --> 11:26.120
So now you've got a garding angel
with a snipe rifle.

11:26.199 --> 11:27.316
<i>Do you hear yourself?</i>

11:27.329 --> 11:29.736
Did you call to give me a hard time
or to help me out?

11:30.842 --> 11:31.852
We need to talk.

11:33.004 --> 11:35.298
You're making it very hard
to be your friend right now.

11:35.483 --> 11:36.478
Andrea?

11:42.557 --> 11:43.554
<i>Hey, this is Rita.</i>

11:43.868 --> 11:44.878
<i>Leave a message.</i>

11:46.359 --> 11:47.539
Just charged it...

11:50.851 --> 11:53.414
- I need to find my brother.
- Yeah, yeah, let's go.

11:53.415 --> 11:55.065
<i>Why are you doing this to me?</i>

11:56.271 --> 11:57.293
Here you go.

11:57.294 --> 11:58.623
Chad, I told you I'm not hungry.

11:58.624 --> 12:02.133
Come on, we could be here a while.
You got to keep your strength out.

12:05.122 --> 12:07.662
I did some asking around,
it turns out that's Garza's wife.

12:07.874 --> 12:08.884
What?

12:10.105 --> 12:12.255
- The guy...
- Yeah, the one Hopper whacked.

12:14.076 --> 12:15.047
Sorry.

12:15.466 --> 12:17.530
Word is, she's homicide ace in the hall.

12:17.753 --> 12:19.535
Says she saw Hopper do the deed.

12:19.562 --> 12:20.689
It's how they got the warrant

12:20.743 --> 12:22.518
- in the 1st place.
- That's not possible.

12:22.777 --> 12:24.507
Well, don't kill the messenger!

12:29.606 --> 12:32.772
What are you doing? Rita! Hey, no!
That's a witness! No you can't!

12:37.301 --> 12:38.284
Kill the lights.

12:51.411 --> 12:52.380
I got blood.

12:55.264 --> 12:57.579
Looks like somebody
forgot to go to the cleaners.

13:01.566 --> 13:04.267
- Get this to the SID. Put a rush on it.
- Right away, sir.

13:06.285 --> 13:07.294
What?

13:07.386 --> 13:09.129
- This doesn't fell right.
- How's that?

13:09.496 --> 13:12.118
A decorated cop decides
to kill a man he never met.

13:12.810 --> 13:14.316
And stashes the gun at his place

13:14.330 --> 13:17.947
and leaves a bloody shirt
right around his girlfriend's apartment?

13:19.327 --> 13:20.602
Leave the room, guys.

13:26.523 --> 13:28.988
Don't ever question a case
in front of anyone else.

13:29.014 --> 13:31.400
When I see something hinky,
I'm not gonna keep quiet about it.

13:31.401 --> 13:32.371
Hopper's too smart

13:32.426 --> 13:34.812
- to do some this stupid...
- All killers make mistakes.

13:34.909 --> 13:37.281
Even the smart ones,
especially the smart ones.

13:37.294 --> 13:38.626
They all think they're not getting

13:38.698 --> 13:41.646
get caught but they always do.
So get used to it: Hopper's the guy...

13:43.389 --> 13:44.766
- You have a problem?
- No...

13:44.845 --> 13:45.814
No problem.

13:46.396 --> 13:47.963
Just sounds like you wanna nail Hopper

13:48.035 --> 13:50.198
more than you wanna catch
Garza's killer.

14:11.113 --> 14:12.096
- Yeah?
- <i>Brett?</i>

14:13.106 --> 14:14.940
Rita. Thank God.

14:15.176 --> 14:17.378
Are you OK? I've been so worried.

14:17.415 --> 14:18.791
<i>Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.</i>

14:19.105 --> 14:22.003
Listen, now I know they're telling you
all sorts of things about me.

14:22.004 --> 14:24.457
They have an eyewitness, Brett.
The wife.

14:25.122 --> 14:26.171
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

14:26.990 --> 14:29.597
- How do you know?
- I just know. She's lying.

14:30.087 --> 14:31.474
And what about the shirt?

14:33.023 --> 14:34.500
- What shirt?
<i>- Your shirt.</i>

14:34.563 --> 14:37.543
The one they found in my apartment.
With blood on it.

14:38.074 --> 14:40.191
They're saying
it's a match to that man Garza.

14:40.223 --> 14:41.402
Wait. That's...

14:41.970 --> 14:43.618
That's never happened before...

14:43.915 --> 14:45.923
Maybe you should think about
turning yourself in.

14:46.013 --> 14:48.282
Wait.
Really, you don't think I did this?

14:48.922 --> 14:49.894
<i>Baby.</i>

14:51.741 --> 14:54.135
Did somebody gets to you?
What's happening?

14:54.217 --> 14:55.694
Brett, we can get you helped.

14:55.774 --> 14:57.534
I mean it's best for everyone.

14:57.823 --> 15:00.713
What do you mean? What are you talking
about,"we"? Who's "we"?

15:02.744 --> 15:03.851
Give yourself up, Hopper.

15:04.392 --> 15:06.625
It's the only chance you have right now.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.605
- Yeah, I got to go.
- Brett, please.

15:28.717 --> 15:30.748
DAY 2 (del vo)

15:33.918 --> 15:35.417
Did I say something wrong?

15:37.623 --> 15:38.911
Are you even listening?

15:39.707 --> 15:42.066
- Sorry, what?
- What is it with you, Brett?

15:42.166 --> 15:45.124
You woke up and made conversation
to dump out a hamper.

15:45.206 --> 15:46.119
You wouldn't understand.

15:46.155 --> 15:48.437
How must I understand, Brett,
if you won't even talk to me?

15:48.482 --> 15:49.725
Because, I've told you already.

15:49.770 --> 15:51.102
- When?
- Yesterday.

15:51.355 --> 15:52.850
And the yesterday before that.

15:53.103 --> 15:54.760
And the yesterday before that.

15:54.994 --> 15:56.514
It's not your fault, I just...

15:56.593 --> 15:58.655
- What are you talking about?
- I wish somebody

15:58.727 --> 16:02.842
would remember something, anything
that I told them, anything that I said.

16:06.897 --> 16:09.891
In 20 seconds that phone is gonna ring
and it's gonna be Andrea.

16:09.936 --> 16:12.003
She's gonna call and tell me
that she's taking Eddie

16:12.033 --> 16:13.543
to rehad because he started using again.

16:13.587 --> 16:16.456
Now, at first Eddie was killed,
but then I changed the day.

16:16.546 --> 16:17.672
Alright, so...

16:17.820 --> 16:20.126
Right now,
honestly I'm just trying to...

16:20.486 --> 16:23.159
- Are you okay?
- No, I definitly am not ok.

16:39.825 --> 16:40.806
Hey, Andrea.

16:42.364 --> 16:44.570
Yeah, he is here. Can he call you back?

16:50.948 --> 16:53.127
You're totaly freaking me out.

16:53.290 --> 16:55.306
- This is some kind of...
- I'm sorry, I really am.

16:55.487 --> 16:57.545
I can't have this conversation today.

17:22.117 --> 17:23.098
I see you...

17:24.224 --> 17:25.432
What are you doing here?

17:25.503 --> 17:27.395
You're not supposed to be in here.

17:28.295 --> 17:30.853
- Why the hell are you following me?
- I'm always here!

17:31.042 --> 17:32.730
You're the new guy, I'm here every day.

17:32.802 --> 17:35.093
- "I'm here every day"?
- I mean today.

17:35.300 --> 17:36.876
Only a different "today".

17:36.939 --> 17:39.642
- Look, I don't have time to explain.
- You know what? I think you do!

17:40.138 --> 17:41.101
No way.

17:41.358 --> 17:43.280
- You can never believe me. Nobody does.
- Try me.

17:43.371 --> 17:44.739
I don't even understand.

17:45.946 --> 17:47.363
- Spit it out!
- It's always today!

17:47.435 --> 17:49.605
Over and over!
And I'm stuck in it, okay?

17:50.956 --> 17:51.965
There...

17:52.361 --> 17:53.351
You're happy?

17:56.040 --> 17:56.940
+

17:57.989 --> 17:59.231
Say that again.

18:00.582 --> 18:01.860
I know how it sounds.

18:02.405 --> 18:04.170
You're saying it's the same day.

18:04.535 --> 18:05.805
that it's repeating?

18:06.062 --> 18:07.358
Go ahead, laugh.

18:08.907 --> 18:10.321
I've to get back to work.

18:11.498 --> 18:14.455
Director dude's gonna show up
and there isn't much time.

18:14.527 --> 18:15.734
Do you recognize me?

18:17.012 --> 18:18.165
I don't know.

18:18.589 --> 18:20.417
- Should I?
- Come on, man.

18:21.511 --> 18:22.834
It's important.

18:23.762 --> 18:25.257
Why? Why do you care?

18:27.508 --> 18:30.138
Because the same thing
is happening to me too.

18:34.464 --> 18:35.454
Very funny.

18:35.842 --> 18:38.228
You make fun of the cripple kid.
You want my lunch money?

18:38.300 --> 18:40.853
I'm not joking, you've seen me before,
haven't you?

18:42.515 --> 18:43.703
At the police station.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.729
I tell them I'm looking for my brother.

18:46.823 --> 18:48.948
But everyday, it's the same.

18:49.029 --> 18:50.325
It's the same for me too.

18:50.596 --> 18:52.437
I wake up in the same place, same time

18:52.438 --> 18:55.049
same damn bird,
same damn Dodger game!

18:55.593 --> 18:56.656
The Dodgers...

18:57.628 --> 18:59.159
- Do they win?
- Yes.

18:59.259 --> 19:01.284
They rally in the bottom of the neith.

19:01.505 --> 19:02.586
Finally!

19:06.607 --> 19:07.768
It's okay.

19:07.867 --> 19:09.849
He is a very close fan of mister Garza.

19:10.903 --> 19:12.595
He just heard what happened, sorry man.

19:13.037 --> 19:15.406
Of course,
I... just need to get my day planner.

19:15.478 --> 19:17.411
Listen!
He just lost one of his best friends.

19:17.464 --> 19:18.897
Just give us a minute, please!

19:19.290 --> 19:20.247
Of course.

19:23.060 --> 19:25.421
Come on, we got to get out of here man,
too many cops around.

19:25.474 --> 19:26.510
But I'm not finished!

19:26.546 --> 19:27.635
Finished with what?

19:28.461 --> 19:29.562
It's a membership list.

19:29.614 --> 19:32.262
The man who took my brother
belongs to this club.

19:32.312 --> 19:33.688
So your brother's missing?

19:33.689 --> 19:35.484
Not missing. They took him.

19:35.798 --> 19:38.918
But I've been coming here everyday,
trying to find the guy that did it.

19:39.101 --> 19:40.203
What's his name?

19:40.255 --> 19:41.870
I don't know. I know what he looks like.

19:41.961 --> 19:42.827
With glasses.

19:42.879 --> 19:45.763
So you just come here everyday
and hope he just shows up?

19:45.985 --> 19:48.096
No, I've got a plan, I'm not an idiot!

19:49.710 --> 19:52.464
I'm memorizing the membership list

19:52.830 --> 19:55.085
Names, addresses, the whole enchilada!

19:55.413 --> 19:57.011
I'm already up to the end of this.

19:57.985 --> 19:59.033
Here a better plan.

20:09.435 --> 20:12.121
- Mr. Summer?
- I know this is a delicate situation.

20:12.239 --> 20:14.083
And I'm pleased the club can
offer our members

20:14.084 --> 20:15.721
a safe respite in their time of need.

20:15.722 --> 20:16.691
Your point.

20:16.720 --> 20:19.049
We have an extremely demanding
membership.

20:19.336 --> 20:22.128
I cannot afford having one of your
detectives coming into my office.

20:23.596 --> 20:25.229
Our people are all here in this room.

20:25.810 --> 20:27.379
I beg to differ. This...

20:27.961 --> 20:29.611
African American gentleman
just flashed me

20:29.692 --> 20:31.250
his badge and kicked me out!

20:31.447 --> 20:32.443
Show me.

20:41.738 --> 20:43.739
This is Choi.
Keep a detail on Mrs. Garza

20:43.811 --> 20:44.995
and lock down the building.

20:45.048 --> 20:46.647
How long has this been happening to you?

20:46.687 --> 20:48.285
- What?
- The day. Repeating.

20:54.647 --> 20:55.696
I didn't have this.

20:59.782 --> 21:00.936
I don't know anymore.

21:02.260 --> 21:03.361
How about you?

21:03.990 --> 21:05.000
Three weeks.

21:05.366 --> 21:06.323
Three...

21:06.690 --> 21:09.587
That's the... That's the magic number.

21:13.137 --> 21:14.749
Oh, you gotta be kidding me...

21:20.780 --> 21:24.135
Open every door, every closet,
every bathroom stall.

21:24.319 --> 21:25.285
Hey man...

21:27.110 --> 21:28.671
Dude, what did you do to me?

21:28.775 --> 21:30.414
Nothing. You blacked out.

21:31.348 --> 21:32.358
I hate that.

21:32.909 --> 21:34.049
Happens a lot.

21:34.088 --> 21:35.412
That's freaky.

21:35.516 --> 21:38.348
I fall asleep one place
and wake up somewhere else.

21:38.924 --> 21:41.624
Especially after they sticked me
with that needle.

21:44.785 --> 21:46.064
They stick you with a needle?

21:46.360 --> 21:47.274
Yeah.

21:47.409 --> 21:49.670
<i>Relax. Just a mild sedative.</i>

21:49.742 --> 21:52.208
- Did they take you to a quarry?
- No. Some kind of lab.

21:53.325 --> 21:54.775
That's were they grabbed my brother.

21:55.037 --> 21:56.643
Since they though that I was asleep.

21:56.863 --> 21:59.238
But I heard Forasz
talking about this
fancy

21:59.267 --> 22:01.509
fancy schmaltzy club that he belongs to.

22:01.680 --> 22:04.589
And I... I've just got
the name onto my brain.

22:04.890 --> 22:07.672
- The Santyana Club.
- Go back. Who's Forasz?

22:07.737 --> 22:11.618
That's how everybody called him.
The son of a bitch took my brother.

22:13.842 --> 22:16.057
I'm telling that there is
a conspiracy going on here.

22:16.165 --> 22:18.606
Detweiler, he is the one
who injected me.

22:18.718 --> 22:21.699
He's only a middle mouse, man,
but I want the man on top.

22:22.271 --> 22:24.270
- That dude is a member here too.
- Yeah.

22:25.746 --> 22:28.114
You think that we're both looking
for the same guy?

22:28.213 --> 22:30.348
If I'm right, his name is right here.

22:32.682 --> 22:34.338
Give me the key of that door.

22:37.562 --> 22:38.615
This is so great.

22:38.616 --> 22:41.920
We can buy them together. We'd be like
Butch and Sundance, Bonnie and Clyde!

22:44.674 --> 22:47.061
Ok, it's just... nice not to be alone.

22:48.195 --> 22:49.365
Alright, come here.

22:50.014 --> 22:51.285
You gotta stay right here.

22:52.861 --> 22:54.401
- What's your name?
- Hopper.

22:55.076 --> 22:57.751
- Like the painter, that's cool.
- I'm Jared.

22:59.520 --> 23:02.059
Do you have any idea
why this is happening?

23:03.042 --> 23:05.167
No, and i don't know
how to make it stop.

23:06.365 --> 23:07.545
How did you, like,

23:08.085 --> 23:09.085
handle it?

23:10.653 --> 23:12.013
The only way I know how,

23:12.441 --> 23:13.435
be a cop.

23:19.543 --> 23:21.648
How do you manage
to do those things in pen?

23:21.848 --> 23:22.839
Practice I guess.

23:22.956 --> 23:25.702
Help me out.
Do you know Conrad Detweiler?

23:26.819 --> 23:28.316
Sorry. I can't help you.

23:28.433 --> 23:30.216
I'm more interested
in who he hangs with.

23:30.792 --> 23:31.953
It's important.

23:35.420 --> 23:36.494
Maybe...

23:37.295 --> 23:38.898
you can help me with something, though.

23:40.240 --> 23:41.698
73 across.

23:53.488 --> 23:55.145
Sir. I wouldn't.

23:57.743 --> 23:59.498
The emergency exit is that way.

24:10.763 --> 24:11.726
Get in man, get in.

24:14.454 --> 24:16.442
M. Colburn, Detective Brett Hopper.

24:16.867 --> 24:18.441
We have a mutual acquaintance.

24:18.557 --> 24:19.523
Nathan Baxter.

24:20.041 --> 24:20.995
Go.

24:21.903 --> 24:22.867
Hey, drive !

24:26.806 --> 24:28.945
You're the one the cops are after
for the Garza murder.

24:29.414 --> 24:30.609
How do you know that ?

24:30.620 --> 24:32.454
Small club, word gets around...

24:32.468 --> 24:34.392
You shouldn't believe
everything you hear.

24:34.509 --> 24:36.482
Actually I'm being framed
by members of your club.

24:37.894 --> 24:39.233
It's a very serious charge.

24:39.234 --> 24:41.273
That's why I need a good lawyer
to help me prove it.

24:41.332 --> 24:43.196
Come on. You didn't jump in my car

24:43.224 --> 24:44.657
to hire me as your defense attorney.

24:44.658 --> 24:46.766
You got in because you need
a quick get away

24:46.839 --> 24:49.967
My retainers starts at $30000

24:50.108 --> 24:52.649
How is an honest cops supposed
to come up with cash like that?

24:52.797 --> 24:53.797
You're right.

24:54.318 --> 24:55.326
Gimme a dollar.

25:01.016 --> 25:03.668
You are now protected
on the attorney-client privilege.

25:04.738 --> 25:05.852
What about your fee?

25:05.952 --> 25:08.585
Oh, I can make ten times that
on the book too.

25:08.724 --> 25:09.916
Let's go to my office.

25:11.274 --> 25:13.476
So you telling me you were
with Hopper all night.

25:13.477 --> 25:15.807
He went to bed with me,
he woke up next me.

25:15.808 --> 25:17.316
I don't know how to be any clearer.

25:17.343 --> 25:19.404
I appreciate that
and I wanna believe you, really.

25:19.405 --> 25:20.372
You know...

25:21.067 --> 25:23.658
When I ran your drivers licence, some

25:23.659 --> 25:25.413
interesting information came up.

25:26.072 --> 25:28.462
- That's not relevent.
- I was hoping you might have learned

25:28.480 --> 25:30.289
a few things since 2002
like telling the truth.

25:30.290 --> 25:31.965
I said she's done talking to you.

25:34.012 --> 25:35.807
This is a homicide investigation.

25:36.667 --> 25:38.727
And I'm not sure you want her booked
as an accessory.

25:38.897 --> 25:39.935
She stays.

25:45.230 --> 25:46.306
Come on.

25:54.405 --> 25:56.467
I thought that went away.
How would he know that?

25:56.495 --> 25:59.438
They're just bluffing.
Don't worry about it, I took care of it.

26:01.506 --> 26:02.598
This is Jared Pryor.

26:03.042 --> 26:04.923
He claims he was with Hopper
this morning.

26:04.924 --> 26:07.404
Yeah, but we can't talk about it...

26:07.405 --> 26:09.276
It's him and me are the same.

26:09.402 --> 26:11.464
- The same ?
- You know, peas in a pod.

26:11.994 --> 26:13.484
Flies in the ointment.

26:13.485 --> 26:15.427
Can you tell us why you
and Detective Hopper

26:15.428 --> 26:16.860
were at the Santayana club ?

26:17.002 --> 26:17.962
I...

26:18.277 --> 26:19.368
...can't really say.

26:20.350 --> 26:23.708
But if you know who Detweiler,
working for, let me know.

26:26.266 --> 26:27.228
Detweiler?

26:29.832 --> 26:32.426
- Who's that ?
- Do you know where Hopper is now ?

26:33.089 --> 26:34.050
Sure.

26:34.121 --> 26:36.224
He's looking for the man
who's making
it today

26:36.225 --> 26:38.528
over and over again! We both are!

26:41.719 --> 26:42.699
Yeah, well...

26:43.625 --> 26:44.698
Good luck with that.

26:51.262 --> 26:54.200
Now as my lawyer, you have full access
to the evidence against me, right ?

26:54.317 --> 26:55.861
Well, we're get into that.

26:55.974 --> 26:58.144
But first, there are a few ground rules.

26:58.252 --> 27:00.728
Don't talk to anyone about the case.

27:00.805 --> 27:02.686
No wives, girlfriends,

27:02.777 --> 27:05.343
that could make them
potential witnesses in a trial.

27:05.451 --> 27:07.433
And don't talk to the press
about anything.

27:08.252 --> 27:09.548
Do you have a publicist?

27:11.182 --> 27:13.271
All right,
I could recommend one for you.

27:13.452 --> 27:15.684
This case is gonna be
trialed in the media...

27:15.766 --> 27:18.251
<i>Hopper shouldn't have receive
the package yet, it's important.</i>

27:18.314 --> 27:21.159
<i>This hourglass
was found next to a dead body.</i>

27:24.802 --> 27:26.927
Now you got 3 minutes, start talking.

27:30.330 --> 27:31.230
+

27:32.944 --> 27:34.308
Tell me about this hourglass.

27:34.371 --> 27:37.465
- It's from the club. What does that...
- Shut up! I'm asking the questions.

27:37.528 --> 27:39.905
- Who else has one?
- Everyone on the board.

27:39.968 --> 27:42.904
- What board?
- I can't tell you if I can't breathe.

27:50.100 --> 27:52.324
The Santayana board of directors.

27:52.391 --> 27:53.903
Every member of the board

27:53.993 --> 27:56.892
past and present, gets an hourglass
when they're voted in.

27:56.964 --> 27:58.523
Kind of an inside joke.

27:58.613 --> 28:00.657
Keep them from
talking too long at meetings.

28:01.467 --> 28:04.899
Would you mind telling me what is
so important about a damn hourglass?

28:04.945 --> 28:07.110
It's the second one
I've seen just like it.

28:07.407 --> 28:10.118
- The 1st was sent to me by Garza.
- But you said you didn't know him.

28:10.208 --> 28:11.765
I never event met the guy.

28:12.765 --> 28:14.206
I don't know why he sent it.

28:14.757 --> 28:17.251
But it's evidence
in a 15 year old murder case.

28:17.513 --> 28:20.736
Isabella Contreras.
I think she worked at your club

28:20.898 --> 28:22.412
and was killed by one of your members.

28:22.547 --> 28:24.680
What has an old murder case
have to do with Garza?

28:24.761 --> 28:26.651
I don't know but
it's all connected to this club.

28:26.715 --> 28:29.344
That's why you saw me there,
I was after this.

28:31.433 --> 28:33.568
- A list of members.
- And you suspect them, don't you?

28:33.640 --> 28:35.585
Yeah, one or more
of these men is a killer.

28:35.881 --> 28:38.988
If you're right,
and I hardly doubt that you are,

28:39.348 --> 28:41.281
you've narrowed it down
to the 400 of the richest

28:41.282 --> 28:43.328
most powerful people in the city.

28:43.410 --> 28:45.998
How many of them are on the board
of the directors? A couple dozen?

28:46.080 --> 28:47.637
Yes, sounds right.

28:48.610 --> 28:50.690
- Who are they?
- You really want to know?

28:52.404 --> 28:53.746
All right.

28:54.152 --> 28:56.656
Here Robert Diminico.
He's the deputy mayor.

28:56.728 --> 28:58.605
Winston Wales, philantropist.

28:58.649 --> 29:00.952
Giselle Mack
runs the city art's foundation.

29:00.953 --> 29:02.170
Seth Bath.

29:02.287 --> 29:03.634
Alex Forasz.

29:03.695 --> 29:04.730
Here's your friend Garza.

29:04.756 --> 29:05.729
Wait. Go back.

29:09.008 --> 29:09.762
Forasz...

29:09.821 --> 29:11.655
<i>I heard Forasz talking about this...</i>

29:11.656 --> 29:13.884
<i>this fancy schmaltzy club
that he belongs to.</i>

29:16.357 --> 29:17.340
Good luck, detective!

29:17.733 --> 29:20.223
The DA is gonna be pushing hard
on this one!

29:20.332 --> 29:22.162
Why don't you just let me push back?

29:22.359 --> 29:24.986
I'll make some calls,
see how strong that case is.

29:25.088 --> 29:26.057
But...

29:26.425 --> 29:27.590
Next time...

29:28.063 --> 29:29.020
No choking...

29:29.639 --> 29:30.599
Yeah.

29:37.041 --> 29:39.230
- Hopper!
- Hey, Andrea. I need you to run a check

29:39.282 --> 29:41.237
on an Alexander Forasz.

29:41.269 --> 29:43.720
<i>See if he has a jacket.
- Hopper, what is going on?</i>

29:43.745 --> 29:45.634
There's a board out on you.
Robbery, homicides.

29:45.635 --> 29:47.889
I know. I killed Garza
and went after his wife,

29:47.915 --> 29:49.278
and I did a bunch of bad stuff.

29:50.327 --> 29:52.346
How can you be so damn flip about this?

29:52.394 --> 29:55.156
Because I don't have the time.
you always end up helping me in the end,

29:55.157 --> 29:56.694
so could we just skip to that, please ?

29:56.695 --> 29:58.620
I always help you?
What am I, your secretary?

29:58.671 --> 30:00.612
No, you're my partner.

30:04.870 --> 30:06.460
All right, you have to give me a second,

30:06.473 --> 30:08.305
this hasn't exactly been my easiest day.

30:08.339 --> 30:09.774
Yeah, well, you and me both.

30:11.079 --> 30:12.600
- What was that name again?
<i>- Forasz.</i>

30:12.809 --> 30:15.530
F-O-R-A-S-Z.

30:15.708 --> 30:17.071
<i>Alexander Forasz.</i>

30:21.259 --> 30:22.464
Okay, I've got a hit.

30:22.845 --> 30:24.502
But he's clean.
Not even a parking ticket.

30:24.618 --> 30:25.636
What's the hit?

30:26.147 --> 30:29.830
He filed a restraining order against
some guy named Jared Pryor.

30:31.705 --> 30:32.674
<i>I'm Jared.</i>

30:32.942 --> 30:33.911
Is this helping?

30:34.443 --> 30:36.293
Yeah. Do you have an adress for Forasz?

30:44.126 --> 30:46.705
I did some asking around,
it turns out that's Garza's wife.

30:47.772 --> 30:48.736
What are you doing?

30:49.284 --> 30:50.084
You can't just...

30:50.123 --> 30:51.971
That's a witness! You can't just...
Rita!

31:02.548 --> 31:03.513
Thank you.

31:05.340 --> 31:07.766
I know you're in a lot of pain
and I'm...

31:07.975 --> 31:09.028
I'm so sorry.

31:09.994 --> 31:11.425
But you're wrong about him.

31:12.275 --> 31:13.245
What?

31:13.389 --> 31:17.304
Brett Hopper couldn't have killed
your husband. He was with me all night.

31:19.186 --> 31:20.208
Who are you?

31:21.972 --> 31:23.020
I'm his girlfriend.

31:24.855 --> 31:26.732
Alberto was my husband.

31:28.060 --> 31:30.164
We were married for twenty-two years.

31:30.853 --> 31:33.595
- I'm so sorry.
- I heard his name first.

31:34.409 --> 31:35.746
Your boyfriend.

31:36.834 --> 31:38.054
Alberto said it...

31:38.382 --> 31:39.352
Hopper.

31:39.463 --> 31:41.218
Clear as I am saying it to you.

31:41.782 --> 31:42.622
And then I heard...

31:44.666 --> 31:46.337
I came downstairs but he was...

31:47.584 --> 31:49.459
Alberto was liying there.

31:50.769 --> 31:51.832
I saw him.

31:52.302 --> 31:54.937
Standing over my husband, with a gun.

31:58.066 --> 31:59.958
I saw his face.

32:19.512 --> 32:20.461
<i>Detective Hopper?</i>

32:20.692 --> 32:21.662
<i>Barry Coldburn.</i>

32:21.687 --> 32:22.659
We've got problems.

32:22.893 --> 32:25.463
Can you be a little more specific
or is that on my dollar bills?

32:25.567 --> 32:26.527
<i>Well, to begin,</i>

32:27.044 --> 32:29.106
they've got the murder weapon
with your prints,

32:29.259 --> 32:31.180
your shirt, with Garza's blood on it,

32:31.508 --> 32:33.981
<i>not to mention the eyewitness,
Garza's wife.</i>

32:33.982 --> 32:35.641
- She's lying.
<i>- It doesn't matter.</i>

32:35.664 --> 32:37.983
The prosecution puts
the grieving widow on the stand,

32:37.997 --> 32:40.402
you might as well start
planning the menu for your last meal.

32:40.430 --> 32:43.951
Look, the cops are in on this,
on all levels. Witnesses lie,

32:44.012 --> 32:45.264
lab results get doctored.

32:45.265 --> 32:47.914
If you're saying to me
an entire system is against you,

32:47.954 --> 32:49.944
that this is one big conspiracy,

32:49.957 --> 32:52.769
let me warn you,
juries don't take kindly to the C word.

32:52.781 --> 32:54.669
- I know how this sounds.
<i>- Do you?</i>

32:54.944 --> 32:57.146
If you're laying pipe
for an insanity defense...

32:57.159 --> 32:59.784
That's not what this is.
I'm being framed.

32:59.853 --> 33:03.031
Yeah, maybe... but as your attorney,
I have to advise you.

33:03.072 --> 33:04.816
The evidence against you is...

33:05.513 --> 33:07.127
extremely compelling.

33:07.166 --> 33:09.321
<i>If you want my best advise, take a plea.</i>

33:09.569 --> 33:11.444
I can probably get you murder II.

33:11.465 --> 33:14.658
<i>That's fifteen to life,
but no chances of the death penalty</i>

33:43.224 --> 33:45.427
So, thanks. Thanks for helping me out.

33:46.014 --> 33:47.812
I have to be really careful.

33:47.904 --> 33:48.928
Sorry, man.

33:51.120 --> 33:52.020
+

33:58.112 --> 33:59.397
Okay, I confess!

33:59.515 --> 34:01.088
I killed Alberto Garza.

34:01.153 --> 34:03.197
- Alright?
- No, you didn't, you idiot!

34:11.148 --> 34:12.235
Where is Detweiler?

34:12.556 --> 34:13.723
On the swing set?

34:13.980 --> 34:15.612
You've been playing in the wrong park!

34:16.898 --> 34:19.261
I know he's answered to somebody
at the club, is that you?

34:19.429 --> 34:21.449
Forget about the Santayana Club.

34:21.514 --> 34:23.020
You won't get any answers there.

34:24.253 --> 34:25.524
But where am I supposed to look?

34:26.074 --> 34:27.065
A little closer to home.

34:28.053 --> 34:28.984
Thanks, that's helpful!

34:29.246 --> 34:31.681
Your old man was on the right track
with the girl.

34:33.025 --> 34:33.983
My old man?

34:34.554 --> 34:35.681
What are you talking about ?

34:35.759 --> 34:36.797
Here, smart guy...

34:38.306 --> 34:39.289
Figure it out!

34:43.862 --> 34:44.864
For the zip ties.

34:45.859 --> 34:47.025
Who are you, guys?

34:48.362 --> 34:49.726
Think of us as...

34:50.145 --> 34:51.324
friends of your father.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.149
DAY 3 (del vo)

35:06.597 --> 35:07.961
Somebody's tense.

35:09.704 --> 35:10.714
What's wrong?

35:11.004 --> 35:11.975
Nothing.

35:13.652 --> 35:14.913
We went to bed last night,

35:14.994 --> 35:16.717
and everything was fine.
What happened?

35:17.388 --> 35:18.934
Did you have a nightmare or something?

35:21.609 --> 35:22.657
The worst ever.

35:26.173 --> 35:27.143
That's okay.

35:28.271 --> 35:29.306
It's just a dream.

35:41.971 --> 35:43.661
Yeah, Jen, it's me, we need to talk.

35:43.766 --> 35:45.352
It's... about Dad.

35:45.949 --> 35:48.059
I'm wondering if you have any
of his old stuff?

35:48.137 --> 35:49.782
I'll call you back later today.

35:57.052 --> 35:58.022
Jared!

36:01.910 --> 36:03.129
Get in, man. Get in.

36:12.669 --> 36:13.547
Why are we here?

36:13.809 --> 36:16.116
Do you know a man named
Alexander Forasz?

36:16.863 --> 36:17.833
Yeah.

36:18.740 --> 36:19.966
Maybe. I...

36:20.248 --> 36:21.846
I think so. I am not sure.

36:21.859 --> 36:23.589
He took a restraining order
out against you.

36:24.397 --> 36:26.651
Yeah, well, that's because
I almost caught him.

36:27.058 --> 36:28.171
But he got away!

36:30.333 --> 36:32.037
You think he's the one
who took my brother?

36:32.103 --> 36:33.498
The one that we're looking for?

36:34.192 --> 36:35.425
That's the reason we're here.

36:35.608 --> 36:36.578
Come on.

36:38.347 --> 36:39.382
I can't do this.

36:39.971 --> 36:42.895
Could you just...
You know, while I stay here?

36:43.530 --> 36:44.919
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

36:46.388 --> 36:47.359
Alright.

36:52.602 --> 36:53.561
<i>Yes?</i>

36:53.614 --> 36:56.642
LAPD. I'd like to as some questions
about a Jared Pryor.

36:57.198 --> 36:59.086
<i>You know, I have
a restraining order against him.</i>

36:59.099 --> 37:00.187
Yes, that's why I'm here.

37:00.271 --> 37:01.477
Please, sir, it's important.

37:14.344 --> 37:15.970
Would you like some coffee, detective...

37:16.040 --> 37:17.050
Hopper.

37:17.692 --> 37:19.038
I thought you might know that.

37:20.900 --> 37:22.502
How do you know Jared Pryor?

37:23.153 --> 37:24.124
It's complicated.

37:24.241 --> 37:26.562
I'm sure it is.
Did Detweiler introduce you?

37:26.853 --> 37:28.850
- Who?
- Did you meet to the Santayana Club?

37:28.921 --> 37:29.887
A club?

37:30.646 --> 37:33.216
- How do you know I belong to the club?
- What did you do to Jared?

37:33.375 --> 37:35.188
- What did you do with his brother?
- Nothing!

37:35.189 --> 37:37.266
- Who the hell are you?
- I was his surgeon!

37:38.112 --> 37:39.124
His surgeon?

37:40.436 --> 37:41.427
Jared was...

37:43.136 --> 37:44.726
He was a successful bond trader

37:44.798 --> 37:46.707
for one of the largest firm
in the whole world,

37:46.724 --> 37:48.459
until his seizures
just got out of control.

37:48.460 --> 37:49.443
Seizures?

37:49.902 --> 37:52.025
- From what?
- Temporal lobe epilepsy.

37:52.065 --> 37:53.979
Jared had one of the worst cases
we'd ever seen.

37:54.057 --> 37:56.213
It got so drastic
he just couldn't function.

37:56.240 --> 37:57.708
We had to perform surgery.

37:58.416 --> 37:59.661
Like in brain surgery?

37:59.714 --> 38:01.378
Yes, sir. We saved his life.

38:01.672 --> 38:03.311
But there were side effects.

38:03.888 --> 38:05.361
Hallucinations, black-outs,

38:05.362 --> 38:08.357
even sufferance from
hyperactive episodes of <i>déja-vu</i>

38:13.092 --> 38:14.042
"Déja-vu"?

38:14.411 --> 38:16.889
It's that feeling that you're
reliving a moment over and over.

38:16.951 --> 38:18.547
Yeah. I think I've heard of it.

38:18.671 --> 38:21.412
Jared will have
multiples episodes of this every day.

38:21.464 --> 38:23.976
So he latches on to what's familiar.

38:24.421 --> 38:26.018
He'll repeat routines,

38:26.110 --> 38:28.589
he'll go
to the same place
day after day. He will have...

38:28.765 --> 38:30.194
sudden bursts of memory.

38:31.281 --> 38:33.486
That's there is just so much
about the brain that...

38:33.654 --> 38:34.873
we don't understand.

38:34.928 --> 38:36.509
Like the memory of his brother.

38:36.621 --> 38:39.157
- What happen to his brother?
- Well, he died.

38:39.536 --> 38:42.527
Cancer more than a year ago, but see,
Jared doesn't remember.

38:42.609 --> 38:44.441
As far as he's concerned,
his brother was alive

38:44.494 --> 38:46.976
when he went into surgery
and gone when he woke up, so...

38:49.005 --> 38:50.157
In a sens, yeah...

38:51.409 --> 38:52.472
I'm responsible.

38:53.705 --> 38:55.686
I took the memory of his brother
away from him and

38:55.794 --> 38:57.411
that's why he comes after me.

38:57.977 --> 38:59.473
He actually believes that

38:59.824 --> 39:02.363
he is a victim of some sort
of grand conspiracy and

39:02.464 --> 39:04.400
that I'm, some king of lean leader.

39:09.405 --> 39:12.026
How would somebody know
if they had this...

39:13.260 --> 39:14.259
condition?

39:14.340 --> 39:15.763
Other than the seizures? They...

39:16.321 --> 39:17.690
They probably wouldn't but...

39:28.282 --> 39:29.335
So?

39:29.686 --> 39:32.239
He's not who I thought he was.

39:32.897 --> 39:35.247
He want's to talk to you though.
He'll tell you everything.

39:35.693 --> 39:37.143
Did you find my brother?

39:39.152 --> 39:41.133
No, but Forasz said he'll...

39:41.277 --> 39:42.682
He'll tell you where he is.

39:52.489 --> 39:53.570
Thank you.

39:54.456 --> 39:55.420
For what?

39:55.457 --> 39:57.514
You're the first person
that believe in me.

39:58.106 --> 40:00.609
The first one that really understood.

40:03.725 --> 40:05.770
I've been alone, for so long.

40:21.171 --> 40:22.902
Anyway, I owe you an apology.

40:22.974 --> 40:25.190
I shouldn't have treated you
the way that I did.

40:26.369 --> 40:27.405
Don't worry about it.

40:27.855 --> 40:28.872
We're good.

40:30.031 --> 40:32.127
Still, I'm sorry I bit you.
