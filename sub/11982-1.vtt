28:35.109 --> 28:37.008
Cute girl.

28:38.243 --> 28:39.943
Oh, I frowned.

28:40.277 --> 28:42.177
Where is my Riki?

28:42.179 --> 28:43.411
Oh, there he is.

28:46.181 --> 28:47.648
How is he, Rosie?

28:48.549 --> 28:52.051
Oh, you know,
has good days and bad days.

28:53.253 --> 28:55.621
Thank God for these children, though.

28:55.623 --> 28:59.091
He just celebrated its
days of this youthful activities.

29:03.697 --> 29:06.664
Hello. -Hello.
How's your head. He seemed very...

29:06.666 --> 29:08.165
Pretty bad.

29:08.167 --> 29:09.466
Good.

29:18.675 --> 29:19.975
Hello, autumn.
Hello, Grace.

29:19.977 --> 29:23.311
I'm sorry, I must have missed this earlier.
- It's fine.

29:23.313 --> 29:25.980
I did not mean to interrupt
reading.

29:25.982 --> 29:28.448
Oh, no, it's just a stupid magazine.

29:31.218 --> 29:32.751
Kupaćeš be?

29:32.753 --> 29:35.487
I do not know.

29:35.489 --> 29:37.322
I'm thinking about it.

29:37.324 --> 29:39.257
Yes, I do.

29:39.259 --> 29:40.458
You should.

29:40.460 --> 29:42.259
It's a nice day for it.

29:42.261 --> 29:43.760
Mama hates swimming.

29:43.762 --> 29:46.295
I'm not much of a swimmer, really.

29:46.297 --> 29:48.397
<i>No, I think</i>
<i>she hates swimming.</i>

29:48.399 --> 29:49.698
<i>Sam thought of him.</i>

29:49.700 --> 29:51.166
Why?

29:51.168 --> 29:52.734
I do not know.

29:52.736 --> 29:55.502
All these bodies think it bothered her.

30:01.074 --> 30:04.376
It is obvious that Lucy and Stefan
doing what. Severe.

30:04.378 --> 30:05.343
No idea.

30:05.345 --> 30:09.380
Yes, but when it works gently...
These are just ogovranja in the hallways, but...

30:09.382 --> 30:11.348
Whatever.

30:11.350 --> 30:12.716
Have you heard of Kevin and Jamal?

30:12.718 --> 30:13.750
What about them?

30:13.752 --> 30:14.617
Kevin Reynolds?
-Yes.

30:14.619 --> 30:18.220
Apparently they had sex
on a trip with a group.

30:18.222 --> 30:19.588
Stop, they're gay?

30:19.590 --> 30:20.689
Yes.

30:20.691 --> 30:23.191
Tyler Collins came out of the hall

30:23.193 --> 30:26.460
I saw them in the hotel room to
doing what.

30:26.462 --> 30:27.627
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

30:27.629 --> 30:28.628
<i>Yes.</i>

30:31.132 --> 30:32.431
Strange.

30:33.266 --> 30:34.799
Strange?

30:34.801 --> 30:36.167
I'm gay.

30:37.435 --> 30:40.403
Wait, what?

30:40.405 --> 30:42.138
Seriously?

30:42.140 --> 30:43.472
How do you know?

30:43.474 --> 30:46.274
I do not know these things!

30:46.276 --> 30:49.076
Wait, you have a problem with that?

30:49.078 --> 30:50.677
<i>Of course not.</i>

30:50.679 --> 30:52.745
Wait, what does that mean?

30:58.818 --> 31:00.618
<i>Logan, are you okay?</i>

31:00.620 --> 31:02.219
Yes.

31:04.789 --> 31:06.389
New meat, you idiot.

31:12.528 --> 31:14.662
Hey, how's your head?

31:14.664 --> 31:17.231
It's not so bad.

31:17.233 --> 31:18.398
I'm fine.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.299
Please stop asking.

31:20.301 --> 31:22.334
Sorry, mate.

31:22.336 --> 31:24.736
Hey, do you
Wednesday to apply for jobs,

31:24.738 --> 31:26.070
Sure your family know about this?

31:26.072 --> 31:27.071
Yes, I know.

31:27.073 --> 31:28.172
Are you going to go this year?

31:28.174 --> 31:29.339
I do not know.

31:29.341 --> 31:30.573
We'd like to come with us.

31:30.575 --> 31:32.374
It will be better than last year.

31:32.376 --> 31:33.608
Who goes there?

31:33.610 --> 31:35.643
Almost everyone here, I think.

31:35.645 --> 31:38.712
Gabe goes,
Emily is going, going, John,

31:38.714 --> 31:40.814
<i>trying to convince</i>
<i>Cup to go.</i>

31:40.816 --> 31:42.649
Nice.

31:42.651 --> 31:45.618
Also interested to know whether you're interested

31:45.620 --> 31:47.686
To go to Sunday school sometimes.

31:47.688 --> 31:49.721
<i>We hope to start</i>
<i>the whole youth group,</i>

31:49.723 --> 31:51.089
<i>we all do.</i>

31:51.091 --> 31:52.390
Oh, I do not know.

31:52.392 --> 31:53.858
You can choose any topic.

31:53.860 --> 31:55.826
In addition to homosexuality,
I took it.

31:55.828 --> 31:57.494
And I have vanity.

31:57.496 --> 31:59.128
Yes, you do.

32:47.269 --> 32:49.503
So how do you like Columbia Christianity?

32:49.505 --> 32:53.173
I still try to find out
, but I like it. - Yes.

32:53.475 --> 32:57.410
My cousin was there and he loves it.

32:57.412 --> 32:58.744
You teach physics and biology, is not it?

32:58.746 --> 32:59.911
Yes.

33:00.445 --> 33:02.446
So, how exactly does it work?

33:02.448 --> 33:05.682
- What do you mean?
- <i> Biology at the Christian school.</i>

33:05.684 --> 33:08.351
Do teach evolution... or...?

33:08.353 --> 33:12.389
Well... Can you teach biology without evolution
.

33:12.391 --> 33:14.724
Yes, you can teach math without numbers.

33:14.726 --> 33:17.460
Yes, it's called logic.

33:17.462 --> 33:19.361
My cousin took it.

33:19.363 --> 33:24.265
So how exactly this
teach that life begins?

33:24.267 --> 33:27.867
I think you they're--

33:29.669 --> 33:31.670
Bypass around things?

33:31.672 --> 33:34.472
Yes, it's a little strange, but

33:34.474 --> 33:38.342
Yes to focus on...
No, this is not surprising.

33:38.344 --> 33:40.911
This school is wonderful, do not listen to them.

33:40.913 --> 33:44.781
I think I am capable of
to think for themselves, you know?

33:44.783 --> 33:46.315
Yes, well.

33:46.317 --> 33:47.482
Do it.

33:48.317 --> 33:49.317
Hi, folks.

33:49.319 --> 33:49.984
<i>Yes, join us.</i>

33:49.986 --> 33:51.852
Yes.
Hello, Riki.

33:51.854 --> 33:56.289
Hi, Happy birthday.
I could talk to you, you were in the pool.

33:56.291 --> 33:57.056
Oh, thank you.

33:57.058 --> 33:59.825
Hello Cup.
<i>Rikster, how are you?</i>

33:59.827 --> 34:01.927
Are you ready for a camping
in a few weeks?

34:01.929 --> 34:04.462
<i>Yeah, we</i>
<i>talking about this.</i>

34:04.464 --> 34:05.463
We are trying to convince the Cup to go.

34:05.465 --> 34:06.464
Yes, you should go.

34:06.466 --> 34:07.665
<i>It'll be great.</i>

34:07.667 --> 34:11.568
<i>Totally.</i>
I do not know, I'm not the type of camp.

34:11.570 --> 34:13.036
You go, Riki?

34:13.038 --> 34:15.071
If you Kate goes with me.

34:15.072 --> 34:16.871
Yes we're still trying to come up

34:16.873 --> 34:18.572
Situation with another person.

34:18.574 --> 34:20.373
<i>Usually we</i>
<i>a lot of fun, though.</i>

34:25.045 --> 34:26.413
It's mine.

34:26.415 --> 34:27.580
Oh, I'm sorry.

34:30.917 --> 34:31.750
<i>And all these women</i>

34:32.052 --> 34:33.818
Practically kidnapped

34:33.820 --> 34:35.319
Streets

34:35.321 --> 34:37.821
Girls kidnapped from their beds -

34:37.822 --> 34:41.056
And then sold to be sex slaves

34:41.059 --> 34:44.460
And it is happening right here in America.

34:44.462 --> 34:46.995
<i>There is a wonderful organization</i>

34:46.996 --> 34:48.730
Called <i> In his hands</i>

34:48.732 --> 34:50.431
So I think

34:50.433 --> 34:52.533
To Kraljevo town needs to be attached

34:52.534 --> 34:54.768
<i>I know Larry wants</i>
<i>to talk to Bob about that</i>

34:54.770 --> 34:59.372
<i>because I think it's a crisis.</i>

34:59.374 --> 35:04.877
A few people talk about the global crisis.

35:04.879 --> 35:06.612
Who would have said.

35:06.614 --> 35:08.981
And then there's the porn.

35:08.983 --> 35:12.617
I saw a show the other night

35:12.619 --> 35:15.419
The entertainment industry for adults

35:15.421 --> 35:21.891
But these girls and boys are
18, 19, 20 years

35:21.893 --> 35:25.494
Are not much older than the children there,

35:26.062 --> 35:29.731
And they get up every morning
i go to work,

35:29.733 --> 35:33.135
And have sex with older men,

35:33.837 --> 35:35.736
<i>every day</i>
<i>daily</i>

35:35.738 --> 35:40.139
<i>on najponižajuci,</i>
<i>terrible, unimaginable way...</i>

35:40.808 --> 35:43.942
No ketchup. - I'll get it, honey.
- <i> No, I'll do it.</i>

35:43.944 --> 35:44.943
Are you sure?

35:44.945 --> 35:46.644
Yes.

35:50.748 --> 35:52.482
I do not know, sometimes

35:52.484 --> 35:59.455
I look at our sexual
US state

35:59.457 --> 36:01.557
I know that God is coming.

36:01.559 --> 36:06.094
<i>I do not know anything</i>
<i>o tom, Boni.</i>

36:06.096 --> 36:10.598
I think that for some of these woman

36:10.600 --> 36:14.100
<i>the more economic need</i>
<i>than sex.</i>

36:14.102 --> 36:15.935
I have not followed.

36:15.937 --> 36:18.070
I think for some social problem

36:18.072 --> 36:20.472
Have to see where it arises and

36:20.474 --> 36:27.544
<i>it seems to me that these women</i>
<i>end up in prostitution,</i>

36:27.546 --> 36:29.946
For something else,

36:29.948 --> 36:32.682
Be they economic difficulties

36:32.684 --> 36:35.918
Or lack of opportunities for education.

36:35.920 --> 36:39.121
Or inadequate sex education.

36:41.691 --> 36:44.025
Do not be a democrat with us.

36:47.996 --> 36:50.464
Barbara is printed
those programs for tomorrow?

36:50.466 --> 36:52.466
Yes, I saw them at the office

36:52.468 --> 36:53.800
When I was there before.

36:53.802 --> 36:55.168
Good.

36:57.437 --> 36:59.171
When an event opens tomorrow, yeah?

36:59.173 --> 37:02.174
If you do not mind.
No, not at all.

37:06.078 --> 37:07.945
I look forward to

37:07.947 --> 37:12.014
First Korinćanskoj series this fall.

37:12.016 --> 37:13.749
You get sick from the Old Testament?

37:13.751 --> 37:15.717
No, he did not say that.

37:15.719 --> 37:17.585
I can not wait the New Testament.

37:17.587 --> 37:19.720
I heard this.

37:19.722 --> 37:21.121
Oh no,
they're doing a great job.

37:21.123 --> 37:23.123
I love this series.
Well, thanks.

37:23.125 --> 37:25.959
I always feel that I could better prepare
, but-

37:25.961 --> 37:30.563
No, you're doing great, as always.

37:30.565 --> 37:32.698
Do you know who would be proud of you?

37:32.700 --> 37:34.699
Mr. HB.

37:36.501 --> 37:38.001
Well, thank you.

37:39.703 --> 37:43.772
I know it's been difficult
lose such a mentor.

37:43.774 --> 37:46.074
Yes. Thank you.

37:46.076 --> 37:47.608
You do not have to talk about this.

37:47.610 --> 37:49.042
No no no, it's okay.

37:50.778 --> 37:53.479
Taj cancer, it's a terrible thing,
I'll tell you about that.

37:55.215 --> 37:56.515
Yes.

37:57.717 --> 37:59.117
And he was a young man.

37:59.119 --> 38:01.486
I think relatively.

38:01.753 --> 38:03.653
-Looking,

38:03.655 --> 38:04.987
Good health.

38:04.989 --> 38:07.155
He could not see that coming.

38:07.157 --> 38:09.090
-I Do not know.
No, you never know.

38:14.595 --> 38:20.699
Okay, here we are.
I ought to change the channel.

38:20.701 --> 38:21.933
Hey, Coop.

38:21.935 --> 38:26.703
I'm trying to change the channel, this is dirty.

38:26.705 --> 38:29.572
I think the receiver.
Think the battery.

38:31.943 --> 38:34.243
Here it is. We managed.

38:36.247 --> 38:39.714
You need to get rid of these movie channels.
I do not know why they still have.

38:41.183 --> 38:44.084
You know, I do not know how to
she works, but

38:44.086 --> 38:48.087
Ket every day
looking better.

38:48.089 --> 38:49.855
I would not have thought it possible

38:49.857 --> 38:51.723
Because it certainly will not happen
Boni.

38:52.658 --> 38:55.693
Not yet, anyway.
-Yes good.

38:55.695 --> 38:58.127
Thank you.
She's a wonderful person, of course.

39:00.230 --> 39:01.697
Excellent.

39:06.868 --> 39:09.636
I do not know where the basket smeće-

39:09.638 --> 39:11.638
Under the sink.

39:11.640 --> 39:12.805
Oh.

39:14.841 --> 39:16.308
Hey Bob!

39:17.210 --> 39:19.810
-Please.
What's under the sink?

39:21.979 --> 39:24.647
Oh, no no no, it's...
Rozi brought to.

39:24.649 --> 39:26.615
She does not know that we do not drink.

39:26.617 --> 39:28.016
Oh, well.

39:29.818 --> 39:31.118
Why would you?

39:31.120 --> 39:33.220
Oh, you know, such an opportunity.

39:33.222 --> 39:34.787
Ah.

39:37.557 --> 39:39.724
You know, Jesus drank.

39:52.168 --> 39:54.135
Well, I guess I can not.

39:54.137 --> 39:55.569
I already began to feel it.

39:55.571 --> 39:58.938
Oh, I'll take and I can see how it is.

40:01.841 --> 40:05.109
Oh, shit,
need to present the cake.

40:05.111 --> 40:08.912
Do you think it's okay to
take it with me out?

40:08.914 --> 40:12.282
I think I will if it's uncomfortable.

40:12.284 --> 40:14.017
No no no, it's fine, of course.

40:14.019 --> 40:15.785
Good.
Nice.

41:18.313 --> 41:19.646
Do you like him?

41:21.382 --> 41:23.015
Yes.

41:42.266 --> 41:43.933
This is perfect.

41:43.935 --> 41:45.401
Thank you very much.

41:49.840 --> 41:51.941
You are officially hipster.

41:51.943 --> 41:54.043
And now this.

41:59.982 --> 42:01.482
Wait, this is-

42:01.484 --> 42:04.084
The first movie we watched together.

42:04.086 --> 42:05.552
Thank you very much.

42:07.388 --> 42:08.521
You're the best.

42:08.523 --> 42:09.522
Thank you. I know.

42:09.524 --> 42:11.123
This is a book.

42:15.895 --> 42:19.097
<i>Nadzemljaski: Guide</i>
<i>how to become a man of Christ.</i>

42:19.099 --> 42:20.531
Thank you very much.

42:20.533 --> 42:22.466
This is wonderful. I appreciate it.

42:22.468 --> 42:24.033
Course.

42:26.136 --> 42:27.569
You're the best.

42:29.071 --> 42:30.271
<i>Oh, that's me.</i>

42:30.273 --> 42:31.404
Oh, wonderful.

42:34.307 --> 42:37.042
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

42:37.044 --> 42:38.810
<i>This is really nice.</i>

42:38.812 --> 42:41.312
My mother had found a
on diving in Costa Rica.

42:41.314 --> 42:44.315
It's beautiful, thank you, great.

42:44.317 --> 42:45.416
I really like.

42:46.384 --> 42:48.284
<i>Oh, come on, embraced him.</i>

42:48.286 --> 42:51.019
- <i> Yeah, come on.</i>
- <i> What are you doing?</i>

42:52.087 --> 42:53.353
Thank you.

42:53.355 --> 42:55.254
You're welcome.
-Thank you.

42:58.891 --> 43:00.258
<i>Uh, well, what's next?</i>

43:00.260 --> 43:01.492
<i>Can you open my.</i>

43:01.494 --> 43:05.596
- <i> You'll love.</i>
- <i> No, you know what, I'll leave that for later.</i>

43:22.244 --> 43:23.444
What is going on back here?

43:23.446 --> 43:27.614
Oh, we have a little medicine.

44:07.452 --> 44:09.152
Oh!

44:09.154 --> 44:11.287
I'm sorry... Aaron.
-Gđo Gamble.

44:11.289 --> 44:13.555
God, you surprise me.
-Sorry.

44:13.557 --> 44:15.256
The door was open,
I do not mind.

44:15.258 --> 44:17.291
No, do not bother.

44:17.293 --> 44:20.393
Autumn is back, it will be...
surprised when he sees you.

44:21.628 --> 44:23.161
Back to the pool!

44:23.328 --> 44:25.362
Do you want to turn on music?

44:25.364 --> 44:27.530
Yes, you can put the mix B, please?

44:27.532 --> 44:29.665
<i>Sure.</i>
<i>Yeah you're right, Dad?</i>

44:29.667 --> 44:32.434
Larry, what's in the cup?

44:48.648 --> 44:50.582
Oh, hello, Aron.

45:00.292 --> 45:01.292
What are you doing here?
-What do you mean?

45:01.294 --> 45:03.527
You are not invited.
You're not Henry else

45:03.529 --> 45:05.395
You are not my friend, what are you doing here?

45:05.397 --> 45:07.230
I just came to say hello.

45:07.232 --> 45:09.232
Since we are not friends?

45:17.174 --> 45:18.640
Autumn, autumn
what hell are you doing?

45:18.642 --> 45:19.707
Get away from me!
-OK OK!

45:19.709 --> 45:20.607
Help!
Okay, go!

45:20.609 --> 45:23.076
What is it?
You're gonna hit me!

45:23.078 --> 45:25.511
Stop getting in my house!

45:25.513 --> 45:27.145
I'm in your house?

45:27.147 --> 45:28.546
Good.

45:28.548 --> 45:33.083
Can we look at
our actions.

45:33.085 --> 45:34.150
Just as I remember. Because I...

45:34.152 --> 45:36.719
Before you went to school
I am sure that everything was fine

45:36.721 --> 45:38.153
That everything was fine.

45:38.155 --> 45:40.989
And then we say that we will not be together
, we're just friends.

45:40.991 --> 45:44.726
But... I mean,
do you do not remember that?

45:44.728 --> 45:47.328
You sent me sms.
We had lunch together.

45:47.330 --> 45:48.462
You sent me sms three weeks ago.

45:48.464 --> 45:49.629
You'll be home.

45:49.631 --> 45:52.098
I thought so.

45:52.100 --> 45:53.999
Well, what were you thinking?

45:54.001 --> 45:55.033
What is wrong with you?

45:55.035 --> 45:57.468
-Men's Nothing wrong with you, Aaron!
Ouch! Jesus!

46:00.238 --> 46:02.239
What's this?
I do not understand.

46:02.241 --> 46:04.007
Think, Aron.

46:04.541 --> 46:08.142
You took something from me.

46:10.712 --> 46:12.646
What, seriously?
It is because of this?

46:14.348 --> 46:18.750
You... you made me feel...

46:20.719 --> 46:22.286
What did I do?

46:25.490 --> 46:30.293
I thought was nice.
It was not nice, it was...

46:30.295 --> 46:31.661
What? What is it?!

46:31.663 --> 46:37.199
It's... it's... it was
nice... it was terrible...

46:37.201 --> 46:40.335
The way you printed

46:41.603 --> 46:43.170
What kind of way, the autumn?

46:43.172 --> 46:45.338
We both do,
it was our decision.

46:45.340 --> 46:46.772
Am I wrong?

46:46.774 --> 46:48.006
Do not uzajedno decide?

46:48.008 --> 46:49.107
Stop!
Stop, please.

46:49.109 --> 46:50.241
Please, stop!

46:50.243 --> 46:52.343
Hey, come ovamo-
Get away from me!

46:52.345 --> 46:55.446
I want to get back to
brother's birthday party.

46:55.448 --> 46:57.281
Stop talking to me.

46:57.283 --> 46:58.715
What are we doing?

46:58.717 --> 47:00.316
I have no idea!

47:01.751 --> 47:03.284
HOW HAS MODELLING ?!

47:05.620 --> 47:07.253
What ?!

48:23.092 --> 48:23.825
Hello.

48:23.827 --> 48:26.093
Hello.

49:09.502 --> 49:10.702
Do you like this?

49:10.704 --> 49:12.403
Yes.

49:16.407 --> 49:18.574
Henri,

49:18.576 --> 49:21.710
I just wanted you to know that...

49:21.712 --> 49:28.416
I'm totally willing to
... fun with you.

49:28.418 --> 49:31.752
If you're serious.

49:31.754 --> 49:34.921
You look really liked

49:34.923 --> 49:38.190
Since we were partners in prayer.

49:41.460 --> 49:45.496
Can I...
to come back to you?

50:18.828 --> 50:20.728
Honey,

50:20.730 --> 50:22.529
Where you been?

50:22.531 --> 50:24.597
I ran down the street for no reason,

50:24.599 --> 50:28.634
He chased me and now I'm back.

50:33.272 --> 50:34.472
Hey.

50:36.274 --> 50:38.942
It's okay...

50:38.944 --> 50:40.510
... Hey.

50:43.814 --> 50:45.614
You want some wine?

50:52.587 --> 50:53.853
Hi, Bob.

50:54.821 --> 50:55.687
Hi, Ricky.

50:55.689 --> 50:56.988
How are you?

50:56.990 --> 51:00.658
I'm fine, I'm fine.

51:00.660 --> 51:02.993
Hey, Kate told me that you're not sure

51:02.995 --> 51:05.362
The situation
companion in the camp.

51:07.564 --> 51:14.302
So I did not know whether...
I mean, if something...

51:14.304 --> 51:17.506
You know, you should sit down next week

51:17.508 --> 51:19.707
I talk about this
what might be best.

51:22.945 --> 51:24.077
OK?

51:24.745 --> 51:25.945
OK.

51:33.087 --> 51:35.620
I think we're all excited and Ricky.

51:35.622 --> 51:37.788
What does it mean?

51:37.790 --> 51:40.090
I'm not sure it's good for him

51:40.092 --> 51:41.691
To go with a companion in the camp.

51:41.693 --> 51:43.926
Oh, why, for what inidenta?

51:43.928 --> 51:46.828
To be sure, I'm not sure
it was suicide

51:46.830 --> 51:49.597
I think the guy liked pills.

51:49.599 --> 51:51.699
I do not know.

51:51.701 --> 51:54.535
A was the incident in
camp last summer.

51:54.537 --> 51:56.136
What happened in
camp last summer?

51:57.371 --> 51:58.537
I thought you-

51:58.539 --> 52:00.138
What are we talking about here?

52:01.940 --> 52:03.807
I think maybe now is not the time.

52:03.809 --> 52:06.643
No no no no, come on.
What happened?

52:06.645 --> 52:09.846
I think that was the situation in the showers.

52:09.848 --> 52:12.114
What situation?

52:12.116 --> 52:16.751
Well, according to a couple of our boys, Ricky...

52:16.753 --> 52:18.519
On the shower with several boys

52:18.521 --> 52:19.620
A
they thought that he looks...

52:19.622 --> 52:20.787
He might have been challenged.

52:20.789 --> 52:25.157
Oh my God.
Yes, but...

52:25.725 --> 52:28.727
Man,

52:28.729 --> 52:31.629
Certainly a lot of stories.

53:05.628 --> 53:08.529
<i>The plane flying</i>
<i>and I was sick .-</i>

53:08.531 --> 53:13.100
<i>Well, when you're in a plane</i>
<i>six and a half hours.</i>

53:13.102 --> 53:16.202
Oh, my God, I cry.

53:17.604 --> 53:18.737
Why?

53:18.739 --> 53:21.473
I do not know... Mom...?

53:21.475 --> 53:25.677
I'm... I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

53:32.951 --> 53:37.220
You know, the problem with growing up

53:37.222 --> 53:40.156
<i>This is what has...</i>

53:40.158 --> 53:43.792
Never grow up.

53:43.794 --> 53:49.063
You think you're an adult, your body
peaked,

53:49.065 --> 53:54.801
But you still... grow up.

53:55.235 --> 53:57.102
<i>You really never ready.</i>

53:58.804 --> 54:00.771
<i>You never actually... you're on your way.</i>

54:01.973 --> 54:04.741
Why is this a problem?

54:04.743 --> 54:07.009
Because you have kids.

54:13.582 --> 54:18.752
In the fall, I want you to... izvinim-

54:18.754 --> 54:22.688
No, Mom.
No, I will not. I will.

54:22.690 --> 54:24.189
<i>Look at me.</i>

54:26.892 --> 54:30.561
I want to apologize

54:30.563 --> 54:32.796
If I ever made
to be ashamed of their bodies.

54:32.798 --> 54:34.230
What? What do you mean?

54:34.232 --> 54:37.666
You did not.
No, no, I did.

54:39.635 --> 54:41.135
I'm sorry.

54:49.644 --> 54:51.111
Tell me that's fine.

54:57.250 --> 54:58.917
It's okay.

55:07.994 --> 55:11.662
Listen, autumn
I want to be honest with you.

55:13.765 --> 55:17.100
<i>Something happened to me</i>
<i>in the recent past.</i>

55:17.102 --> 55:20.136
<i>Or, some time ago.</i>

55:20.138 --> 55:22.538
In fact, it was the series...

55:27.543 --> 55:30.177
Something happened to me and...

55:31.145 --> 55:33.879
I'm not sure what will happen to me.

55:35.916 --> 55:38.116
-Bob?
<i>One second!</i>

55:41.686 --> 55:42.852
Riki said.

55:42.854 --> 55:44.887
Can I talk to you for a minute?

55:44.889 --> 55:47.155
<i>Yes, I'm coming right away,</i>

55:47.157 --> 55:49.056
<i>Just to porbinem</i>
<i>for something I forgot.</i>

56:00.667 --> 56:03.068
I need you to tell me
the next time you do it.

56:03.070 --> 56:05.336
That's fine
No, that's not right.

56:05.338 --> 56:07.104
They're a bunch of jerks.

56:07.106 --> 56:10.040
- Yes, I do.
- I know.

56:10.042 --> 56:14.144
Can not you go through
B wing to the library?

56:14.146 --> 56:16.212
Maybe you should try it.

56:16.214 --> 56:18.714
Yes, I think maybe.

56:18.716 --> 56:20.849
After all, it's the end of the school year.

56:20.851 --> 56:22.049
I think you can.

56:24.352 --> 56:25.685
Hey.

56:26.720 --> 56:28.187
It will be better.

56:31.791 --> 56:34.858
Well, no, seriously!
He will.

56:34.860 --> 56:38.094
I really think it will be better for us.

56:44.333 --> 56:46.834
Hey Grace, have you seen Ricky?
He was looking for me?

56:46.836 --> 56:48.168
No, sorry.

56:51.905 --> 56:54.673
<i>Do you remember when you</i>

56:54.675 --> 56:57.809
Do you remember when I went
i was with Mr. Matthew

56:57.811 --> 57:00.144
When Rosie had some obligations?

57:00.146 --> 57:02.246
Riki was still working in the best shopping,

57:02.248 --> 57:04.948
And she needed help.

57:04.950 --> 57:08.117
Yes, I think I remember.

57:08.119 --> 57:11.954
<i>That was before the</i>
<i>He went to the hospital</i>

57:11.956 --> 57:14.056
<i>on the last cycle</i>
<i>treatment</i>

57:14.058 --> 57:15.791
<i>before you went to school.</i>

57:15.793 --> 57:17.759
Oh, well, yes.

57:17.761 --> 57:24.365
He was very ill,
but not so sick

57:24.367 --> 57:29.636
You can not enjoy...
in the time he had left.

57:30.971 --> 57:32.237
Yes.

57:34.039 --> 57:36.373
<i>At that time, your father</i>

57:36.375 --> 57:38.842
<i>spend more time with him</i>
<i>than I do.</i>

57:38.844 --> 57:45.681
But the road with him...
we are very well socialized.

57:45.683 --> 57:50.651
<i>He was... a real pleasure.</i>

57:53.421 --> 57:58.724
However, at one point, a couple of weeks,

57:58.726 --> 58:02.194
<i>-Mr Matthew -</i>
<i>Can you call him BB.</i>

58:08.400 --> 58:10.333
No, I can not.

58:12.969 --> 58:19.040
<i>One day he looked at me</i>
<i>grinning and said,</i>

58:19.042 --> 58:25.312
"God, you you could be a movie star."

58:29.016 --> 58:31.917
You know, he was a very handsome man

58:31.919 --> 58:34.085
<i>even at the end.</i>

58:34.087 --> 58:35.419
He was.

58:35.421 --> 58:37.788
I think I'm flattered,

58:37.790 --> 58:41.458
You know, I was careless.

58:41.460 --> 58:45.227
Then, he continued to speak,
"God, it's true...".

58:48.030 --> 58:53.199
And in that moment he began to
looking at me...

58:53.201 --> 58:59.171
He started looking at me as if I
worth of attention.

59:03.809 --> 59:05.709
<i>The first nothing happened.</i>

59:09.213 --> 59:10.947
<i>But then you eat.</i>

59:14.017 --> 59:15.217
<i>A couple of times.</i>

59:15.219 --> 59:18.220
Wait.

59:18.222 --> 59:19.421
Do you think...?

59:21.824 --> 59:25.027
Oh, sorry.
No, it's okay.

59:25.029 --> 59:28.430
<i>No, it's not right,</i>
<i>I did not.</i>

59:45.313 --> 59:47.213
Does Dad know?

59:48.582 --> 59:50.348
Yes.

59:52.417 --> 59:54.317
How did that go?

59:56.586 --> 59:58.053
It's not good.

59:59.889 --> 01:00:02.223
But he's good, I think.

01:00:03.592 --> 01:00:05.192
I think.

01:00:05.194 --> 01:00:07.227
I do not know, autumn.

01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:10.897
What about Rosie?

01:00:10.899 --> 01:00:12.531
She does not know.
I will never know.

01:00:15.301 --> 01:00:19.103
That's probably for the best.
-Yes.

01:00:26.043 --> 01:00:28.110
Do you still love daddy?

01:01:17.157 --> 01:01:19.691
<i>I do not think he's gay,</i>
<i>I mean, he's just confused.</i>

01:01:19.693 --> 01:01:22.527
Delio's bed with him in the camp
last year, nothing happened.

01:01:22.529 --> 01:01:26.330
Well, you've shared a bed with Logan
and nothing happened

01:01:26.332 --> 01:01:27.931
But it does not change anything.

01:01:27.933 --> 01:01:30.133
Comrade, Logan is not gay.

01:01:31.302 --> 01:01:32.301
-Kuper.
What?

01:01:32.303 --> 01:01:37.272
I'm not saying that's a bad thing,
I'm just saying that this is obvious.

01:01:37.274 --> 01:01:39.974
It's not a good thing,
it is safe.

01:01:39.976 --> 01:01:42.009
So, what do you think?

01:01:42.011 --> 01:01:44.311
Well,

01:01:44.313 --> 01:01:47.147
I think that Christ teaches us to love everyone,

01:01:47.149 --> 01:01:50.216
Whether zavisinici,
criminals or gays.

01:01:50.218 --> 01:01:51.217
Hate the sin, love the sinner.

01:01:51.219 --> 01:01:52.518
Well, yes.

01:01:54.087 --> 01:01:55.220
That surprises me.

01:01:55.222 --> 01:01:57.121
Why?

01:01:57.123 --> 01:01:59.223
I do not know.
I think I...

01:01:59.225 --> 01:02:01.425
I think that's all people
immediately realized.

01:02:04.695 --> 01:02:07.129
You think because I'm married?

01:02:08.698 --> 01:02:11.132
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>It's not at all the same.</i>

01:02:11.134 --> 01:02:13.134
People do not choose your race

01:02:13.136 --> 01:02:16.003
The way you choose to be gay.

01:02:18.706 --> 01:02:19.639
Hello.
-Hi Dad.

01:02:19.641 --> 01:02:21.240
Where have you been?

01:02:21.242 --> 01:02:22.608
Oh, we're just talking.

01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:24.176
Have you seen Ricky?

01:02:24.178 --> 01:02:25.577
Yes.

01:02:25.579 --> 01:02:28.046
You could be a little
with your brother, you know!

01:02:28.048 --> 01:02:30.214
<i>I</i>
<i>I'll be back!</i>

01:02:31.182 --> 01:02:33.216
It will be right back.

01:02:35.152 --> 01:02:36.719
How are you?
-Okay.

01:02:36.721 --> 01:02:39.188
You?
-I'm fine.

01:03:04.743 --> 01:03:07.277
<i>After</i>

01:03:07.279 --> 01:03:12.281
If you... yeah, I do not know...

01:03:12.283 --> 01:03:17.085
If you want to go back, anyway,

01:03:17.087 --> 01:03:20.688
Promise not to run away and scream.

01:04:42.266 --> 01:04:43.366
Can you save me?

01:04:43.368 --> 01:04:44.767
I can save you.

01:04:44.769 --> 01:04:47.870
If you choked you, I would like,
I believe, I believe the...

01:04:47.872 --> 01:04:50.272
Me, I
need resuscitation.

01:04:51.807 --> 01:04:53.374
Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:04:53.376 --> 01:04:56.310
You're a great savior.
I did, always. It does not matter what.

01:04:57.512 --> 01:04:59.346
Hey, Kate, can we talk for a moment
?

01:05:00.614 --> 01:05:02.581
Well, I'll try to survive without you.

01:05:02.583 --> 01:05:04.382
Okay, thanks a lot, try to...

01:05:06.418 --> 01:05:07.885
I'm sorry, gentlemen,
forgive me, gentlemen,

01:05:07.887 --> 01:05:09.886
Forgive me, Lord,
forgive me, gentlemen...

01:05:12.389 --> 01:05:13.689
Stop.

01:05:16.359 --> 01:05:20.127
I think that this is a much
things happening, you know,

01:05:20.129 --> 01:05:21.394
Bad influence

01:05:21.396 --> 01:05:24.196
Sexual confusion.

01:05:27.266 --> 01:05:31.435
Well, comrade, the best we can
is to follow Christ's example.

01:05:31.437 --> 01:05:33.303
That's it.

01:05:33.305 --> 01:05:36.439
I do not know, it seems to me
this is very urgent.

01:05:36.441 --> 01:05:38.774
It seems to me as if...

01:05:38.776 --> 01:05:41.543
It seems to me that we are losing a whole generation.

01:06:29.884 --> 01:06:33.253
Oh, well, that's what I'm talking about!

01:06:33.255 --> 01:06:34.554
What were you doing, honey?

01:06:34.556 --> 01:06:36.355
Watching TV.

01:06:36.357 --> 01:06:38.457
I do not know why.

01:06:38.459 --> 01:06:39.691
This is a beautiful night.

01:06:39.693 --> 01:06:42.759
Do you want to leave her alone!
<i>Do whatever you want, Grace!</i>

01:06:44.461 --> 01:06:46.328
<i>Thank you, Dad.</i>

01:06:46.330 --> 01:06:47.429
What is it?

01:06:49.231 --> 01:06:50.698
Well, I'm a little!

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:53.266
Well, I'm going to bring you, Miss Rosie.

01:06:56.203 --> 01:06:58.737
Do you all drink alcohol?

01:07:00.473 --> 01:07:02.507
Where is Aron went?

01:07:02.509 --> 01:07:04.208
I do not know.

01:07:06.945 --> 01:07:09.212
Do you know that I love you?

01:07:11.348 --> 01:07:12.581
Of course I do.

01:07:20.455 --> 01:07:22.556
Oh, thank you, dear.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:28.893
Do you want some?

01:07:31.363 --> 01:07:32.696
No, thank you.

01:08:09.562 --> 01:08:11.563
Kathleen

01:08:11.565 --> 01:08:15.466
I'm not sure for some of these
Henrijevih comrades.

01:08:15.468 --> 01:08:16.966
What?

01:08:16.969 --> 01:08:18.667
For those there.

01:08:19.336 --> 01:08:21.437
Oh, Heather, and Kristina?

01:08:21.439 --> 01:08:23.538
<i>They are very good</i>
<i>Henry's girlfriend.</i>

01:08:23.541 --> 01:08:24.840
<i>They are beautiful girls.</i>

01:08:26.943 --> 01:08:31.479
A Logan that he is safe
poor, right?

01:08:33.415 --> 01:08:36.783
You know what, I think it's time
to change the channel, Bob?

01:08:36.786 --> 01:08:38.819
Let's move on to the next level?

01:08:38.821 --> 01:08:40.554
I'm not sure what that means, but-

01:08:40.555 --> 01:08:41.921
In fact, I'll do it.

01:08:42.756 --> 01:08:43.890
Hen!

01:08:43.892 --> 01:08:44.557
What ?!

01:08:44.559 --> 01:08:45.925
Our Miks?

01:08:45.926 --> 01:08:47.359
Do it!

01:09:13.086 --> 01:09:14.618
Does anybody want to take a swim?

01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:15.685
I will.

01:09:15.687 --> 01:09:17.586
<i>Grace...</i>

01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:18.953
Come on, Grace, move!

01:09:18.956 --> 01:09:20.455
Yes.

01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:22.656

Swimming?

01:09:40.805 --> 01:09:42.173
Happy birthday, honey.

01:09:42.175 --> 01:09:43.573
Thank you.

Welcome back to the pool.

Well... hello everyone, hello...

<i>You know that.</i>
<i>I know.</i>

01:18:35.116 --> 01:18:37.049
It's not about that.

01:18:38.618 --> 01:18:41.620
I think it is, but it is not so.

01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:50.193

<i>Listen...</i>
<i>-I'll church,</i>

01:19:38.436 --> 01:19:41.136

But I will go to see if my Amy

01:19:43.106 --> 01:19:45.239
Allow me to be with her for a while.

01:19:46.274 --> 01:19:47.607

01:19:51.177 --> 01:19:55.380
You, Bob.

01:19:58.550 --> 01:20:02.486
You should be more with your boyfriend.

01:20:02.488 --> 01:20:04.788
But you he needs you.
No, you need it more.

01:20:08.159 --> 01:20:10.160
He needs your blessing.

01:20:31.181 --> 01:20:33.482
Hey, I listen to music when
go to sleep,

01:20:33.484 --> 01:20:35.183
If it's wrong?

01:20:35.185 --> 01:20:36.484
Yes, that's nice.

01:20:36.785 --> 01:20:39.319
Well... What do you want to hear?

01:20:39.321 --> 01:20:40.787
It's not important.

01:20:40.789 --> 01:20:42.655
You have good taste, you dial.

01:20:42.657 --> 01:20:44.189
Good.

01:21:02.639 --> 01:21:04.572
Hey...

01:21:07.475 --> 01:21:11.845
I want to apologize for...

01:21:13.547 --> 01:21:15.747
I have not talked to you in school.

01:21:17.883 --> 01:21:19.416
<i>or...</i>

01:21:21.819 --> 01:21:24.386

01:21:26.789 --> 01:21:28.456
I'm sorry.

01:21:35.497 --> 01:21:37.264
That's fine.

01:21:45.739 --> 01:21:48.140
Do you want to love?

01:21:51.710 --> 01:21:53.243
What do you think?

01:21:55.145 --> 01:21:57.145
I think... this.

01:21:58.814 --> 01:22:00.815
Perhaps this is good.

01:22:08.723 --> 01:22:10.356
