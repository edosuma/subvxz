00:01.334 --> 00:02.711
- Answer me!

00:02.711 --> 00:06.089
Is this why your
brother killed himself?

00:06.089 --> 00:08.425
- I-I don't know.

00:08.425 --> 00:09.759
- How many of these are there?

00:11.928 --> 00:13.471
- There's hundreds.

00:13.471 --> 00:15.181
They all say the same thing.

00:15.181 --> 00:18.560
- "Hey, bro.
Got raped again today.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.979
Thanks for everything."

00:20.979 --> 00:24.482
"Hey, bro.
Got raped again today.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.109
Thanks for everything.
Love, Jeffrey."

00:26.109 --> 00:27.569
- All right, that's enough.
- "Hey, bro..."

00:27.569 --> 00:30.071
- That's enough, Ma, stop.

00:30.071 --> 00:32.323
- Why would he say
"thanks for everything"?

00:32.323 --> 00:33.783
Who--why would he...

00:33.783 --> 00:35.285
- I'm the one who turned him in.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.579
- What?

00:37.579 --> 00:39.330
- Okay, it was
his only hope, Ma.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.291
- You're the one
who called the cops on him?

00:41.291 --> 00:43.126
- I didn't know he was
dealing, all right?

00:43.126 --> 00:44.711
- Why would you fucking do that?

00:44.711 --> 00:46.171
- I didn't mean--
I did--Ma!

00:46.171 --> 00:47.964
I thought he would only--
stop, stop!

00:47.964 --> 00:49.591
I thought he would only get
a couple of months, okay?

00:49.591 --> 00:50.925
I didn't know.

00:50.925 --> 00:53.553
- Why?
- I didn't know!

00:53.553 --> 00:58.892
♪ Now,
now, now, now, now ♪

00:58.892 --> 01:01.061
- Can't believe
you never told us.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.104
- Not exactly my
proudest moment.

01:03.104 --> 01:05.356
- Fuck.

01:05.356 --> 01:07.317
To be getting those
letters every goddamn day...

01:07.317 --> 01:09.694
- I mean, fuck.

01:09.694 --> 01:12.030
The day he gets
out of jail,

01:12.030 --> 01:14.282
you figure he's thinking,

01:14.282 --> 01:17.535
"I'm finally free."

01:17.535 --> 01:19.788
I guess in his mind,
he was never gonna be.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.499
So he...

01:26.294 --> 01:27.962
- He jumped.

01:27.962 --> 01:29.464
- Off a building.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.841
- Centennial Bridge.

01:31.841 --> 01:34.594
- You knew?
Why didn't you tell me?

01:34.594 --> 01:37.222
- 'Cause it's none
of your business,

01:37.222 --> 01:38.932
and I knew you'd be blabbing
around town about it.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.934
- I don't blab.
Since when do I blab?

01:40.934 --> 01:41.851
- Who should I give this to?

01:41.851 --> 01:44.354
- I'll take that.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.730
His brother just
jumped off a bridge.

01:54.864 --> 01:57.826
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:57.826 --> 02:00.954
Good afternoon.
Are you Ed?

02:00.954 --> 02:03.581
- Uh, yes, I am.

02:03.581 --> 02:06.126
- I'm--I'm Joon-Ho.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.878
- Uh, Joon-Ho?
- Correct.

02:08.878 --> 02:11.548
Look, I just wanted to say,

02:11.548 --> 02:14.926
I'm just really sad
about your brother, Jeffo.

02:14.926 --> 02:18.680
- Oh.
Uh, thank you.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.850
Yeah, uh, were you
and Jeffrey friends or...

02:21.850 --> 02:24.269
- At--at one time, yeah.

02:27.230 --> 02:30.525
- How did you guys
know each other?

02:30.525 --> 02:32.277
- We did business together,

02:32.277 --> 02:34.821
which is kind of
what brings me here.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.031
See, your brother owed me
a little bit of money,

02:37.031 --> 02:38.950
and we had this agreement
that when he got out,

02:38.950 --> 02:42.453
he'd pay me back,
but, of course, you know...

02:42.453 --> 02:44.956
sorry about Jeffo.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.749
- Yeah, uh, Joon-Ho?

02:46.749 --> 02:49.627
We actually call him Jeffrey.

02:49.627 --> 02:53.506
- Well, anyway, uh, since...

02:53.506 --> 02:55.216
since he can no
longer pay me back,

02:55.216 --> 02:58.136
I'm afraid you're
going to have to.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.804
- Oh, uh, me?

02:59.804 --> 03:02.056
Are you--
you're serious?

03:02.056 --> 03:04.350
No, his debts were his problem.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.227
- Well, that's
one point of view.

03:06.227 --> 03:08.104
The other is that families
got each other's back

03:08.104 --> 03:10.440
through thick and thin.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.691
- Uh, what?

03:11.691 --> 03:13.693
- Look, seven years ago,

03:13.693 --> 03:16.821
your brother borrowed
$23,000 from me.

03:16.821 --> 03:18.740
Factor in interest
and penalties,

03:18.740 --> 03:21.576
he now owes me $86,000,

03:21.576 --> 03:27.415
which means you
now owe me $86,000.

03:27.415 --> 03:31.044
- Okay, he owed you 23,000
seven years ago,

03:31.044 --> 03:33.504
and now he owes you 86,000?

03:33.504 --> 03:35.632
That's like a...

03:35.632 --> 03:37.926
it's like a 39% interest rate.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.677
It's, uh, pretty steep.

03:39.677 --> 03:43.223
- But I think you're
doing college math,

03:43.223 --> 03:45.808
and this is street math.

03:45.808 --> 03:50.104
- Yeah, well, in any math,
I still don't owe you anything.

03:50.104 --> 03:52.565
And besides, I don't have
that kind of money.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.192
- Look, you seem like
a really nice guy

03:54.192 --> 03:57.153
who's good at math, and, um,

03:57.153 --> 03:59.364
I'm not a violent man.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.574
- The fuck, man?

04:01.574 --> 04:02.951
- Whoo!
- You fucking...

04:04.118 --> 04:06.537
Usually, I'm not a violent man,

04:06.537 --> 04:09.332
but when people get
dismissive of me,

04:09.332 --> 04:11.584
I-I act out of character.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.253
- Get the fuck back!

04:13.253 --> 04:14.754
- It's just Kleenex, okay?
- Fuck!

04:14.754 --> 04:16.089
- Yo. Hey.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.508
Wow.
I am so sorry.

04:18.508 --> 04:19.717
There's something else
you should know about me...

04:19.717 --> 04:20.802
- Jesus fucking Christ.

04:23.054 --> 04:25.682
- I'm mean.
- Ah!

04:25.682 --> 04:28.184
Stop fucking doing that!
Jesus!

04:28.184 --> 04:29.894
-
- Fucking go!

04:29.894 --> 04:31.229
Get the fuck out of here!

04:33.147 --> 04:34.649
- Actually, I was just leaving.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.359
- Please, go!

04:36.359 --> 04:38.820
- But I'm gonna see you tonight,

04:38.820 --> 04:40.154
'cause here's
what's gonna happen.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.786
You're gonna meet
me, 10:00 p.m.,

04:46.786 --> 04:48.538
at the Round-Up Diner.

04:53.751 --> 04:57.297
You're gonna bring a 5 grand
good-faith down payment.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.631
And then I'm gonna
leave you alone

04:58.631 --> 05:00.425
till two weeks from
today, at which point,

05:00.425 --> 05:02.510
you're gonna pay me
the remaining 81 grand

05:02.510 --> 05:06.055
your brother Jeffo,
and now you, still owe me.

05:07.765 --> 05:10.184
See you at 10:00, Eddo.

05:16.065 --> 05:17.608
- Fill in the form,
X marks the spot,

05:17.608 --> 05:18.192
and you're good to go.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.993
You staring at my tits?

05:26.993 --> 05:28.870
- What, no, no.
No, I--

05:28.870 --> 05:31.831
your, uh, I was--
your T-shirt.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.374
- Bullshit.
You were staring at my tits.

05:33.374 --> 05:36.002
- I-I was not.
I wasn't staring at--

05:36.002 --> 05:38.421
- Okay, Cheryl, knock it off.

05:38.421 --> 05:41.883
Don't listen to her.
She's a ballbuster.

05:41.883 --> 05:44.927
Oh, you're picking
up the '04 Escalade.

05:44.927 --> 05:45.720
- Yeah.

05:47.972 --> 05:49.974
- Sorry about your brother.

05:49.974 --> 05:52.435
- Thanks.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.937
- We usually get,
like, one of those

05:54.937 --> 05:56.773
every couple of years.

05:56.773 --> 05:57.940
It's always a tough tow.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.779
- You know what's interesting?

06:02.779 --> 06:04.572
There are two types of jumpers.

06:04.572 --> 06:06.824
One that jumps on one side

06:06.824 --> 06:09.619
and one that jumps
on the other side.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.537
- Yeah, I kind of--
I kind of figured that.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.624
- The ones on the north side,
facing the city,

06:14.624 --> 06:17.543
they can be talked
down 75% of the time,

06:17.543 --> 06:20.171
but the ones on the other side,

06:20.171 --> 06:22.590
with their back
against the city,

06:22.590 --> 06:25.134
they can rarely be talked down.

06:25.134 --> 06:28.805
It's like they've turned
their back on humanity itself.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.140
- You wouldn't happen
to know which side--

06:31.140 --> 06:34.185
- Away from the city.

07:28.406 --> 07:32.577
New World Library
presents "The Power of Now."

07:35.872 --> 07:37.540
I have little
use for the past

07:37.540 --> 07:39.459
and rarely
think about it.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.878
However, I would
briefly like to tell you

07:41.878 --> 07:44.213
how I became to be
a spiritual teacher

07:44.213 --> 07:45.965
and how this book
came into existence.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.259
- Oh, fuck off, Dracula.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.344
Until my 30th year,

07:50.344 --> 07:54.015
I lived in a state of
almost continuous anxiety

07:54.015 --> 07:58.811
interspersed with periods
of suicidal depression.

07:58.811 --> 08:01.439
It feels now as if I'm
talking about some past
lifetime

08:01.439 --> 08:04.942
or somebody else's life.

08:04.942 --> 08:09.363
You cannot find yourself
by going into the past.

08:09.363 --> 08:12.909
You find yourself by
coming into the present.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.831
That is precious indeed.

08:18.831 --> 08:22.710
Time isn't precious at all
because it is an illusion.

08:22.710 --> 08:26.088
What you perceive as
precious is not time

08:26.088 --> 08:29.133
but the one point
that is out of time--

08:29.133 --> 08:31.761
the now.

08:31.761 --> 08:35.431
The more you're focused on
time-- past and future--

08:35.431 --> 08:37.558
the more you
miss the now,

08:37.558 --> 08:39.644
the most precious
thing there is.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.273
End of disc five.

08:52.198 --> 08:55.201
- Hey.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.328
What are you still doing here?
Is everything okay?

08:57.328 --> 09:00.706
- Yeah, no, I, um...

09:00.706 --> 09:02.542
yeah, every--I'd say--
yeah, I'm good.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.254
Hey, you know, my
kid's band is playing

09:06.254 --> 09:08.381
at this little dive
bar down the street.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.132
Do you want to maybe come?

09:10.132 --> 09:12.009
- Oh, um...

09:12.009 --> 09:14.804
- I should warn you,
the sound fucking sucks,

09:14.804 --> 09:17.932
but moms get beers
for half price, so...

09:17.932 --> 09:20.518
- Yeah, no, I, um,
I appreciate the invite,

09:20.518 --> 09:22.728
but, uh, unfortunately,
I'm meeting with this--

09:22.728 --> 09:24.814
this guy later.

09:24.814 --> 09:25.815
- Okay.
- Yeah, thank you, though.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.149
- Sure, sure.

09:30.027 --> 09:31.696
- Uh, what time--
what time are they going on?

09:34.740 --> 09:36.075
- Now.

09:43.749 --> 09:44.625
Yeah, fuck it.
Why not?

09:44.625 --> 09:45.501
Let's go.
