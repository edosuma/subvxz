10:32.281 --> 10:34.207
-She knows a guy.
-You know a guy?

10:34.376 --> 10:36.450
I'm an engineer, Michael.
I know a lot of guys.

10:36.544 --> 10:40.454
-Mm.
-Anyway, this one works
at GoGo Anywhere, and, uh,

10:40.548 --> 10:42.790
he wanted to know if I knew
of anyone else who had been hit.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.200
And?

10:44.293 --> 10:46.961
A defense contractor in Texas.
Last week.

10:47.130 --> 10:49.296
And another one in Michigan,
the week before that.

10:49.391 --> 10:51.316
And this is the first time
we're hearing about this?

10:51.393 --> 10:55.228
You also didn't hear about
the other 4,000 cyberattacks

10:55.304 --> 10:57.822
-that happen every day.
-Yeah, but there's
backups, right?

10:58.049 --> 11:01.308
You know, redundancies,
firewalls.

11:01.403 --> 11:02.886
Systems designed to-to

11:02.904 --> 11:06.072
help protect us from being
kicked back into the dark ages

11:06.149 --> 11:08.074
by faceless guys
on the Internet.

11:08.226 --> 11:10.560
-Sort of.
-What?

11:10.578 --> 11:15.990
Look, there is no way to
perfectly protect any system.

11:16.009 --> 11:19.010
Right? And most things
in our lives are run on

11:19.162 --> 11:20.586
some sort of automated system.

11:20.739 --> 11:24.757
Banking, supply chains,
the lights in your house,

11:24.910 --> 11:26.184
the water in your faucet.

11:26.335 --> 11:29.412
Someone screws with enough
of those systems and...

11:29.431 --> 11:31.247
people realize that society

11:31.266 --> 11:33.174

11:57.141 --> 12:00.109

12:00.128 --> 12:02.554
GPS navigation

<i> CLERK:</i>

12:19.555 --> 12:22.407
The State of California

Pretrial motions. Honorable

-ATKINS: We're on the record.

12:46.341 --> 12:47.507
All right, whom do we

12:47.601 --> 12:49.267
Your Honor,
Ken Decker for the state.

12:49.494 --> 12:52.228
-(quietly): You need me to...
-Does the defense need a moment?

12:55.424 --> 12:57.942
Your Honor, the defendant
has informed me

12:58.169 --> 13:02.113
that my services
will no longer be required.

13:02.265 --> 13:04.282
He just fired me.

13:04.433 --> 13:06.100
He intends to represent himself.

13:06.194 --> 13:08.027
-Objection...
-What do you mean, objection?

13:08.179 --> 13:10.013
-ATKINS: Settle down. Order!
-This is me trying to get

13:10.015 --> 13:11.122
-a fair trial.
-(gavel banging)

13:11.274 --> 13:13.124
Settle down. Mr. Hudson,

13:13.276 --> 13:14.851
if I do allow you
to represent yourself,

13:14.869 --> 13:17.186
you'll do so with decorum
and you'll follow the rules.

13:17.355 --> 13:19.205
Mr. Decker, I'll hear
what you have to say.

13:19.374 --> 13:21.299
Everyone else, please sit down.

13:21.450 --> 13:24.344
Ms. Risco, for the time being,
that includes you.

13:27.231 --> 13:29.641
Your Honor, this defendant

13:29.868 --> 13:31.476
is charged with six counts
of rape.

13:31.627 --> 13:35.888
Heinous crimes that involved him
stalking his victims,

13:36.041 --> 13:37.390
lying in wait
inside their homes,

13:37.484 --> 13:40.301
and then viciously
attacking them. In addition,

13:40.395 --> 13:43.137
he brutally assaulted
an LAPD sergeant,

13:43.214 --> 13:44.805
beating her nearly to death.

13:44.825 --> 13:48.568
All of these women will be
key witnesses in this trial.

13:48.736 --> 13:52.388
To subject them to being
questioned by their attacker

13:52.407 --> 13:56.125
would be tantamount to allowing
him to assault them again.

13:57.320 --> 13:59.787
I'd like to see counsel
in chambers.

13:59.822 --> 14:01.130
(gavel bangs)

14:06.905 --> 14:08.738
Here you are.

14:08.831 --> 14:10.573
Thanks.

14:10.592 --> 14:12.183
Is he really gonna get
to do this?

14:12.335 --> 14:13.776
Be the one firing questions
at us?

14:13.836 --> 14:15.411
Because I don't think
I can take that.

14:15.430 --> 14:19.248
Which is what he wants. But you
all are stronger than he thinks.

14:19.267 --> 14:21.359
Damn right.
You've already proven it.

14:21.510 --> 14:23.936
So let's just wait and see
what the judge says.

14:24.089 --> 14:26.772
Oh, God, look at them.

14:26.925 --> 14:28.199
So disgusting.

14:28.426 --> 14:31.110
Have you seen their "Free
Jeffery Hudson" Facebook group?

14:31.204 --> 14:33.779
Women like that have something
broken inside of them

14:33.932 --> 14:35.707
that makes them fall
for psychopaths.

14:35.858 --> 14:39.544
Don't look at them. They don't
deserve your attention.

14:39.695 --> 14:41.270
Hey, Athena.

14:41.439 --> 14:43.882
I'm sorry. The judge
is going to allow Hudson

14:44.033 --> 14:46.125
-to represent himself.
-ATHENA: All right.

14:46.277 --> 14:49.370
Remember what we said.
He can't hurt you.

14:49.464 --> 14:50.537
Just stay strong.

14:50.615 --> 14:52.724
DECKER:
Glad to hear you feel that way.

14:52.875 --> 14:55.134
He also just filed a motion
to suppress all evidence

14:55.228 --> 14:57.103
found at Studio Self Storage.

back to his victims.
-I'm aware of that. Believe me.

15:02.218 --> 15:04.310
Sergeant Grant nearly gave her
life to get us that evidence.

15:04.462 --> 15:06.387
I'm aware of that, too.
And so is the judge.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.297
She's going to
hear arguments next session.

15:08.316 --> 15:10.575
She's actually
considering this motion?

15:10.726 --> 15:13.136
DECKER: She is.
And she's allowing Hudson

15:13.154 --> 15:17.498

Of course.

21:54.038 --> 21:55.962
Sergeant Grant, how many times

21:55.982 --> 22:00.735
have you been put on
restricted duty for misconduct?

22:02.380 --> 22:03.654
A few.

22:03.881 --> 22:05.881
How about five times?

22:05.900 --> 22:08.809
-I'm good police.
-No. My, uh...

22:08.828 --> 22:10.143
my personal favorite is the time

22:10.163 --> 22:12.145
that you threatened
a teenage girl

22:12.165 --> 22:13.814
you felt was bullying
your daughter.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.240
I felt?

22:15.317 --> 22:18.077
That girl drove my daughter
to attempt suicide.

22:18.229 --> 22:20.004
So you arrested this minor,
and you threw her in jail.

22:20.081 --> 22:22.340
You know, some people might
consider that an abuse of power.

22:22.567 --> 22:25.084
-She had drugs on her person.
-She said they weren't hers.

22:25.236 --> 22:28.512
-They usually do.
-And sometimes
police plant evidence.

22:28.739 --> 22:33.392
-Your Honor!
-Mr. Hudson,
are we approaching a point?

entire case against me rests

22:38.599 --> 22:43.510
