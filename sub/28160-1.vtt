-Anonymous

00:21.388 --> 00:22.321
-Cyber attack

00:22.323 --> 00:23.822
-A new kind of warfare

00:23.824 --> 00:25.257

-Hackers

00:27.561 --> 00:28.694
-Hacktivists.

00:34.802 --> 00:37.536
-Anonymous has struck
again, with a warning,

00:37.538 --> 00:38.937
this is just the beginning.

00:38.939 --> 00:41.673
-Anonymous is a collective
known for recent attacks

00:41.675 --> 00:43.175
on government and
corporate websites.

00:43.177 --> 00:45.143
-The internet is a
powerful new medium

00:45.145 --> 00:48.080
where just a handful of
people in small groups,

00:48.082 --> 00:50.749
just by shifting data around
in the right directions,

00:50.751 --> 00:52.884
can make big changes
and big damage.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.120
-The more you said, the
more frightening it was.

00:55.122 --> 00:57.189
-The Pentagon is now
singling out Anonymous

00:57.191 --> 01:00.292
as an example of the
serious new cyber-threats

01:00.294 --> 01:01.693
facing the country.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.995
-The fundamental unit here
is information warfare.

01:03.997 --> 01:07.466
-We're gaining back the freedoms
that the forefathers assured us

01:07.468 --> 01:09.901
through technology, and we
can't we can't allow these

01:09.903 --> 01:11.436
freedoms to be taken away.

01:11.438 --> 01:14.973
I will put my body on the altar
of liberty again and again

01:14.975 --> 01:15.374
and again.

01:23.550 --> 01:25.250
-Information is the weapon.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.986
And information properly
understood and properly used

01:27.988 --> 01:31.223
in an honest way is more
effective than anything else

01:31.225 --> 01:32.090
in the world.

01:38.832 --> 01:41.233
-If you've got your eye on
Boeing, yeah, please go for it.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.901
I'd like to see those
fuckers go down.

01:42.903 --> 01:45.270
Dial the code, modify
the code just a bid.

01:45.272 --> 01:46.405
Bombard the Pentagon.

01:46.407 --> 01:48.473
You're either with us,
or you're against us.

02:04.224 --> 02:06.558
RECORDING (ON PHONE):
You have 15 minutes

02:06.560 --> 02:08.226
available for this call.

02:08.228 --> 02:09.895
FEMALE SPEAKER
(ON PHONE): Hello?

02:09.896 --> 02:11.296
ANDREW (ON PHONE): Uh

02:11.298 --> 02:13.432
FEMALE SPEAKER (ON PHONE):
Andrew, are you there?

02:22.109 --> 02:24.743
It's not scary to
be going to prison?

02:24.745 --> 02:26.745
-No, I never was scared
to be going to prison.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.413
There's all these
cool people, and I'm

02:28.415 --> 02:29.981
learning all these cool things.

02:29.983 --> 02:34.319
And I'm making lifelong future
friends and future business

02:34.321 --> 02:35.253
partners, certainly.

02:47.034 --> 02:49.668
Embarrassing people, I enjoy it.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.069
It's viscerally fun.

02:51.071 --> 02:52.571
FEMALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
He's an instigator.

02:52.573 --> 02:53.538
MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
The most lovable little pest

02:53.540 --> 02:54.706
on the internet.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.241
MALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): His ability

02:56.243 --> 02:57.976
to make other people so angry
is the talent that he has.

02:57.978 --> 03:00.812
-Almost 90% of the articles
that come out for Weev, they

03:00.814 --> 03:03.381
all start out with, he's
a dick, he's an asshole.

03:03.383 --> 03:09.855
-Little Weev is going to troll
the fuck out of Apple and AT&T.

03:21.168 --> 03:26.505
-How do I plan on keeping my
corn bread safe in prison?

03:26.507 --> 03:33.311
I will stab a nigger that
dares reach across my plate.

03:38.986 --> 03:43.922
I am the Bruce Lee of regexp.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.690
I didn't get caught.

03:45.692 --> 03:48.126
I put my name on what I did.

03:48.128 --> 03:51.563
I'm not here to play
nice with AT&T. I'm here

03:51.565 --> 03:53.064
to comment and criticize.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.368
There was a URL on
an AT&T web server

03:56.370 --> 03:57.569
with a number at the end.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.938
And if you add one
to this number,

03:59.940 --> 04:02.641
like you could have typed it
in the iPad web browser over

04:02.643 --> 04:07.913
and over again, you would
see the next iPad 3G
user's email address.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.988
Here's AT&T handing
out a complete target

04:17.991 --> 04:19.558
list of their customers.

04:19.560 --> 04:23.762
I was morally required to come
forward and sort of put them

04:23.764 --> 04:24.996
over the coals for this.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.898
It was, like, 114,000
email addresses.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.767
FEMALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
And it's quite a list.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.535
MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER): "New
York Times" CEO Janet Robinson.

04:30.537 --> 04:31.636
FEMALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
White House Chief

04:31.638 --> 04:32.904
of Staff Rahm Emanuel.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.205
FEMALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): Diane Sawyer.

04:34.207 --> 04:35.173
FEMALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): Not to mention

04:35.175 --> 04:36.474
the US Army and Congress.

04:36.476 --> 04:38.143
-And it doesn't get
much more high profile

04:38.145 --> 04:41.012
than Mayor Michael
Bloomberg of New York City.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.048
-Mayor Bloomberg was like,
this isn't a big deal.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.283
It's not like people can't
find my email address.

04:58.765 --> 05:01.132
I'm aggregating
public data and using

05:01.134 --> 05:04.469
it to criticize people
whose politics I dislike.

05:04.471 --> 05:07.572
The FBI is combing
through people's emails,

05:07.574 --> 05:09.708
grossly violating their
constitutional rights.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.376
I think I have moral
superiority here.

05:21.288 --> 05:23.021
-NSA and FBI are
both walking here.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.456
And they're looking
at the computers.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.858
And they're like, oh
my god, these red dots,

05:26.860 --> 05:29.260
they're converging.

05:29.262 --> 05:32.263
They hit a button, renh, renh.

05:32.265 --> 05:33.531
-No black SUV.

05:33.533 --> 05:37.535
There's been black SUVs outside
the past couple of days.

05:42.309 --> 05:44.376
-All the red dots are in
the same room right now.

05:44.378 --> 05:46.011
-There's going to
be even more later.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.812
INTERVIEWER: Magic
fucking genie.

05:47.814 --> 05:48.980
You're actually in power.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.415
You're in charge.

05:50.417 --> 05:52.617
-The most drastic improvements
that need to be made

05:52.619 --> 05:54.219
are in the education system.

05:54.221 --> 05:57.455
We need to give people the kind
of classical Western education

05:57.457 --> 05:58.423
that they used to have.

05:58.425 --> 06:00.692
We need a curriculum
that embraces,

06:00.694 --> 06:02.927
you know, like, Keats and Byron.

06:02.929 --> 06:05.764
INTERVIEWER: It doesn't
sound revolutionary.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.132
-It's absolutely revolutionary.

06:07.134 --> 06:09.334
We have people in power
that have explicitly

06:09.336 --> 06:12.270
engineered our education
system to make people dumb,

06:12.272 --> 06:14.005
obedient, and uncreative.

06:14.007 --> 06:17.275
Getting them out of fucking
power and remaking it

06:17.277 --> 06:21.212
so people can be free-thinking,
well-educated, sensible,

06:21.214 --> 06:23.782
non-reactionary people, this
is a revolutionary thing.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.183
And it's probably
going to require

06:25.185 --> 06:28.887
a whole lot of bloodshed.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.222
INTERVIEWER: Why has
the FBI targeted you?

06:31.224 --> 06:32.691
-They have, by
their own admission,

06:32.693 --> 06:35.427
been surveilling me
since I was 15 years old.

06:35.429 --> 06:36.995
That was in the
search warrant they

06:36.997 --> 06:39.030
used to kick in my door in 2010.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.565
INTERVIEWER: And why?

06:40.567 --> 06:44.936
-They wanted me to it inform
on hackers on the internet.

06:44.938 --> 06:49.307
They've tried to get me
to do that many times.

06:49.309 --> 06:53.511
-There is a congruence between
whistleblowing and hacktivism

06:53.513 --> 06:54.245
and hacktivists.

06:59.186 --> 07:03.421
The similarity is speaking
truth to and of power,

07:03.423 --> 07:06.357
revealing the power structure
whether it's corporate,

07:06.359 --> 07:09.294
whether it's
government, or both.

07:09.296 --> 07:12.163
I was a senior executive at
the National Security Agency.

07:12.165 --> 07:14.632
And I served there for
about six and a half years.

07:14.634 --> 07:16.835
I blew the whistle on the
secret surveillance programs

07:16.837 --> 07:20.371
called Stellar Wind, which were
the foundational surveillance

07:20.373 --> 07:23.641
programs that ultimately
Edward Snowden, 12 years later,

07:23.643 --> 07:26.010
is now disclosing through
reporters and journalists.

07:26.012 --> 07:28.079
The government went
ahead and prosecuted me

07:28.081 --> 07:30.982
under the Espionage Act.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.751
It was a 10 felony
count indictment.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.552
I faced 35 years in prison.

07:46.900 --> 07:51.236
-Hackers are
important in the sense

07:51.238 --> 07:53.371
that they have the
capacity to expose

07:53.373 --> 07:55.540
the secret or the inner
workings of the state, which

07:55.542 --> 07:57.909
is why they are
terrified of hackers,

07:57.911 --> 08:01.479
and they are going after them
with phenomenal vengeance.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.922
-We are looking at
increased transparency.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.257
-Unprecedented transparency.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.098
-He called the former
head of the NSA

08:54.100 --> 08:57.535
at home on a weekly basis
for a couple of months,

08:57.537 --> 08:59.037
trying to get him
to talk to him.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.772
-Barrett was speaking
in that language

09:00.774 --> 09:03.741
of real adversarial journalism,
that the purpose of journalism

09:03.743 --> 09:07.545
is not to please those in power
but to report the truth, even

09:07.547 --> 09:09.948
when it makes those in power
uncomfortable or reflects

09:09.950 --> 09:10.648
poorly on them.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.265
-29 years old, a
cocky college dropout,

09:27.267 --> 09:29.500
a self-described
anarchist, Brown

09:29.502 --> 09:31.970
proclaims he is
policing wrongdoing.

09:31.972 --> 09:35.373
-He was brash, he was
cocky, he was arrogant.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.842
-He was fucking full of himself.

09:37.844 --> 09:39.277
He's awfully narcissistic.

09:39.279 --> 09:42.146
-He held court, so to
speak, from his bathtub.

09:42.148 --> 09:43.481
-Fucking around on Tinychat.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.204
-The take of NBC
brass was Barrett

10:06.206 --> 10:08.806
was not a very
appealing character.

10:08.808 --> 10:17.382
He was not somebody that they
wanted to tout as in any way

10:17.384 --> 10:20.318
heroic or doing an
admirable thing.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.753
-Barrett was
somebody who was very

10:21.755 --> 10:25.356
open about his own struggles
with substance abuse.

10:25.358 --> 10:28.993
-He was on a maintenance
drug, like a methadone.

10:28.995 --> 10:30.328
He was on Suboxone.

10:30.330 --> 10:34.933
At least he was trying
to stay off hard drugs,

10:34.935 --> 10:36.301
to be on at least a medicine.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.943
INTERVIEWER: Who are the
members of Anonymous?

10:44.945 --> 10:46.144
Who are they?

10:46.146 --> 10:47.111
-They're everyone.

10:47.113 --> 10:48.246
I mean, you'd be amazed.

10:48.248 --> 10:49.514
There's obviously
a lot of people

10:49.516 --> 10:50.915
who are hackers who
just working in IT.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.351
They work for major
corporations in some cases.

10:53.353 --> 10:57.288
There's journalists,
writers of all kinds, people

10:57.290 --> 10:59.390
who work at gas stations.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.264
MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
What is Anonymous?

11:06.266 --> 11:07.799
ANONYMOUS: It's
basically the power

11:07.801 --> 11:09.901
of an absolutely massive group
of people coming together.

11:09.903 --> 11:12.570
COMPUTER VOICE: Anonymous are
your brothers and sisters,

11:12.572 --> 11:15.840
your sons and daughters, your

11:15.842 --> 11:17.308
Anonymous is you.

11:17.310 --> 11:18.943
[various foreign languages]

11:27.554 --> 11:31.522
ANONYMOUS: Anonymous cannot
and will not stand idly while

11:31.524 --> 11:34.892
people are being denied
their basic rights and human

11:34.894 --> 11:36.160
liberties.

11:36.162 --> 11:37.328
COMPUTER VOICE:
Understand that something

11:37.330 --> 11:39.430
is horribly wrong
with this world.

11:44.971 --> 11:47.472
[singing]

11:48.541 --> 11:49.774
COMPUTER VOICE: The
Tunisian government

11:49.776 --> 11:52.076
has made itself an
enemy of Anonymous.

11:52.078 --> 11:55.646
The Egyptian government has
revealed itself to be criminal.

11:55.648 --> 11:58.683
For the good of mankind
and for our own enjoyment.

11:58.685 --> 12:01.319
-To end the corruption,
we must expose it.

12:01.321 --> 12:02.720
FEMALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): If you

12:02.722 --> 12:05.556
are working for a corrupt
company, leak the data.

12:05.558 --> 12:09.861
If you are working for a corrupt
government, leak the documents.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.162
-Think for yourself.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.397
Question authority.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.098
COMPUTER VOICE: Join

12:19.272 --> 12:20.471
Anonymous is you.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.306
And you are Anonymous.

You are fighting for

12:24.444 --> 12:26.978
and for the next
step in evolution.

12:30.316 --> 12:32.083
-It's a very
interesting relationship

12:32.085 --> 12:34.786
Barrett has with Anonymous.

12:34.788 --> 12:35.853
Barrett's Anonymous.

12:35.855 --> 12:38.289
He's their spokesperson.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.590
Barrett's not Anonymous.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.192
He's not their spokesperson.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.527
Is Barrett really Anonymous?

12:42.529 --> 12:44.495
Because he doesn't hack,
and he doesn't really

12:44.497 --> 12:46.364
have computer skills.

12:46.366 --> 12:49.067
Well, does he have
a Guy Fawkes mask?

12:51.671 --> 12:55.373
-He was fulfilling a very
valuable and important

12:55.375 --> 12:58.042
function, which was
to give anonymous

12:58.044 --> 12:59.444
the legitimacy it needed.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.379
He was the person who was
willing to go on record.

13:01.381 --> 13:02.980
-It's an open brand.

13:02.982 --> 13:05.883
Like, anyone can sort of label
what they're doing Anonymous.

13:05.885 --> 13:09.220
If you're doing something
that people don't approve,

13:09.222 --> 13:11.289
then Anonymous will
turn in on itself

13:11.291 --> 13:14.325

13:14.327 --> 13:16.494
Like, whatever it is
that doesn't fit in

13:16.496 --> 13:21.466
with the truth-seeking,
justice-seeking ideology.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.936
-Are you not worried that
even an informal involvement

13:24.938 --> 13:28.573
with Anonymous is going to
end up with you targeted,

13:28.575 --> 13:30.641
with you potentially
going to jail for this?

13:37.383 --> 13:41.619
-He was interacting
with other hackers.

13:41.621 --> 13:46.524
A couple times, he wanted to
make the point that he was not

13:46.526 --> 13:50.161
a hacker, that he
was of the community.

13:52.599 --> 13:55.066
-Anonymous members try to hack
into people's personal accounts

13:55.068 --> 13:57.101
and attempt to expose
personal information.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.307
And if we did, we wouldn't
go around bragging about it

14:03.309 --> 14:04.475
beforehand.

14:04.477 --> 14:06.611
We would wait
until we were done.

14:06.613 --> 14:11.716
This article is also poorly
written, and I object to that.

14:11.718 --> 14:15.453
-He wasn't able to just
try to do anything cleanly

14:15.455 --> 14:18.556
without people giving
him a hard time about it.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.258
-My actual title
is Cobra Commander.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.894
Hiss, hiss.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.228
Hiss.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.531
So that's how I need to be
acknowledged, I think, further.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.799
I also go by faggot now.

14:28.801 --> 14:32.036
-These use that
non-pejorative fag.

14:37.844 --> 14:43.314
He's an ego-fag and a moral-fag
and a leader-fag and just about

14:43.316 --> 14:47.552
everything but a
fag-fag, as you know,

14:47.554 --> 14:51.322
leave it to the internet to
have to repeat themselves.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.391
-What happened today
is certainly illegal.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.059
Why are you willing
to show your face?

14:59.432 --> 15:02.466
-Barrett being a named
person was his own doing.

15:02.468 --> 15:03.834
He did not show up as Anonymous.

15:03.836 --> 15:06.370
He showed up as Barrett Brown.

15:06.372 --> 15:09.207
-There's a new world
being born here.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.943
At least, that's the
perspective of the people in it.

15:11.945 --> 15:17.348
And I think Barrett really
reflected that and gave voice

15:17.350 --> 15:21.586
to this emerging world view.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.888
Whether it's valid or
not is another question.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.670
ANONYMOUS: And we do not

15:48.448 --> 15:49.046
Forget.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.057
-Sabu spoke about
things in terms of this

16:00.059 --> 16:03.194
being a movement for
revolution, and everybody

16:03.196 --> 16:04.729
was his comrade or his brother.

16:04.731 --> 16:07.298
-He had kind of built
himself up within Anonymous

16:07.300 --> 16:10.601
and had this
reputation of a like,

16:10.603 --> 16:12.737
doesn't give a fuck
freedom fighter.

16:12.739 --> 16:15.673
-There's de facto leadership,
de facto organizer.

16:15.675 --> 16:18.276
Someone had to have the idea
and start bringing people in.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.511
So for a little while, they're
going to listen to this guy.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.046
They're going to say,
what are we doing here?

16:22.048 --> 16:22.847
Why are we doing it?

16:22.849 --> 16:24.181
-There are two types of hackers.

16:24.183 --> 16:26.784
There's a ghost hacker,
who constantly changes

16:26.786 --> 16:29.120
his identity, so
nobody knows who he is

16:29.122 --> 16:31.789
or even how to really
get ahold of him.

16:31.791 --> 16:35.293
And then there are people with
permanent fixed identities.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.370
-Sabu had a permanent identity.

16:46.372 --> 16:51.409
He made it pretty clear what his
philosophy, his politics were.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.811
-I find him to be
incredibly annoying.

16:53.813 --> 16:56.781
He uses words like
what's up, niggy.

16:56.783 --> 17:01.118
And like, he's a
very, like to me,

17:01.120 --> 17:03.054
I'm very annoyed by
everything he says.

17:03.056 --> 17:06.891
Like I don't like his
terms and the way he talks.

17:06.893 --> 17:10.795
-He was the king of
the hacking world,

17:10.797 --> 17:14.432
doing it like a "sir," in fact.

17:14.434 --> 17:18.035
ANONYMOUS: Friends around the
globe, we are LOL at security.

17:22.442 --> 17:25.643
-LulzSec came from
Anonymous, and they

17:25.645 --> 17:28.079
enjoyed what each other did.

17:28.080 --> 17:30.715
-Laughing out loud at
security LulzSec.

17:44.430 --> 17:45.930
ANONYMOUS: Greetings
from Anonymous.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.798
For the past decade,
the government

17:47.800 --> 17:51.869
has tried to take
control of our internet.

17:51.871 --> 17:55.139
-The Lulz boat was just
sailing the infinite seas

17:55.141 --> 17:59.143
of hacking excellence, hacking
the shit out of everybody.

18:24.170 --> 18:26.370
BARRETT BROWN: Topiary,
is everything all right?

18:26.372 --> 18:28.239
Are you dead?

18:28.241 --> 18:29.874
BARRETT BROWN: Are you OK?

18:29.876 --> 18:31.976
Remember you tweeted my
fucking phone number, said,

18:31.978 --> 18:34.445
-512-560-26 Here's the
leader of the LulzSec.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.746
Call him now.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.181
You threw it on the
fucking LulzSec Twitter?

18:37.183 --> 18:38.249
COMPUTER VOICE: Barrett Brown
is the leader of Lulzec!

18:38.251 --> 18:39.383
Give him a call now!

18:39.385 --> 18:41.886
BARRETT BROWN: I got 200 calls

18:46.626 --> 18:48.626
-Hurry up.

18:48.628 --> 18:52.563
Get the sign.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.165
Do you have it?

18:57.537 --> 19:00.104
[gasp] Oh, my god.

19:00.106 --> 19:01.472
Oh my god.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.441
You did it.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.842
Oh my god.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.378
Oh my you did it, man.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.512
No, I'm watching it.

19:08.514 --> 19:10.281
I'm standing here watching it.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.816
You did it. It's
working. It's totally working.

19:13.019 --> 19:14.518
-If I was working
in a cubicle, I'd

19:14.520 --> 19:16.287
be like, oh, what are those
Lulzsec guys doing today?

19:16.289 --> 19:18.756
MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER): You
know those "God hates fags"

19:18.758 --> 19:21.625
morons that protests
soldiers funerals and stomp

19:21.627 --> 19:22.927
on American flags
because they've

19:22.929 --> 19:24.628
got a problem with gay people.

19:24.630 --> 19:25.963
-God hates fags.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.865
What part of that don't
you understand, girl?

19:27.867 --> 19:30.134
-I don't fucking understand
why God hates fags.

19:30.136 --> 19:31.202
-Because he can.

19:31.204 --> 19:32.837
MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
We can sometimes

19:32.839 --> 19:33.871
take over the websites
themselves, put messages up,

19:33.873 --> 19:35.039
as we did today with Westboro.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.242
MALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): If you check

19:38.244 --> 19:40.244
downloads.westborobaptistchurch
right now,

19:40.246 --> 19:42.146
you'll see a nice
message from Anonymous.

19:42.148 --> 19:44.849
-The hacks got bigger
and bigger and bigger.

19:44.851 --> 19:49.520
Pull up the screen, and they're
like, Tango Down, cia.gov

19:49.522 --> 19:50.354
for the Lulz.

19:57.163 --> 19:59.029
I'm like, oh shit.

19:59.031 --> 20:03.267
-What a hacktivist can do and
does all the time is embarrass

20:03.269 --> 20:06.403
the power elite in a way that
boots on the ground can't.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.610
So you can go and sit in
the front of a building,

20:12.612 --> 20:15.579
you can circle the Pentagon.

20:15.581 --> 20:18.048
That doesn't really
embarrass anyone.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.519
If you hack the
website of the CIA,

20:21.521 --> 20:25.022
you've embarrassed the power
structure of the nation state.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.991
You've embarrassed the Pentagon.

20:26.993 --> 20:29.527
You've embarrassed the
United States of America.

20:29.529 --> 20:34.832
You've embarrassed
it by puncturing

20:34.834 --> 20:37.268
the illusion of their power.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.303
-You made us look bad.

20:39.305 --> 20:40.838
You taunted us.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.306
We don't take to kindly to that.

20:42.308 --> 20:43.641
You embarrassed me.

20:43.643 --> 20:48.512
So when someone comes
along like a hacker

20:48.514 --> 20:56.220
and exposes the dark underbelly
of this beast, that beast,

20:56.222 --> 20:58.789
it's not just
tickling the beast.

20:58.791 --> 21:01.125
They're going to take
some swipes at you.

21:01.127 --> 21:03.494
MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER): One
of the most notorious hacking

21:03.496 --> 21:05.763
groups of all time has
had its head chopped off.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.264
FEMALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): Return

21:07.266 --> 21:08.632
to the government crackdown
on a loose, large network

21:08.634 --> 21:10.401
of politically-inspired
hacktivists.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.169
FEMALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): A 19-year-old

21:12.171 --> 21:14.171
who goes by the nickname
Topiari was arrested

21:14.173 --> 21:16.173
in Scotland's Shetland Islands.

21:20.413 --> 21:25.716
-The FBI will pull in
some 17, 20-year-old kid

21:25.718 --> 21:29.053
and threaten them with
100 years in prison,

21:29.055 --> 21:31.689
just to get them to
inform on people.

21:31.691 --> 21:35.759
There were at least
three snitches

21:35.761 --> 21:39.964
involved in the
takedown of LolzSec.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.166
This was a domino effect.

21:42.168 --> 21:48.138
People were taken into custody
that folded on their comrades.

22:14.233 --> 22:18.202
-On September 17, 2011,
Sabu comes back on Twitter

22:18.204 --> 22:20.170
from his, like,
month-long absence.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.306
And he's like,
rise up, my fellas.

22:22.308 --> 22:25.709
The next thing I know, it's
like, 18 chat rooms are linked

22:25.711 --> 22:29.913
together, and everybody's
working in this Occupy Wall

22:29.915 --> 22:30.781
Street chan.

22:30.783 --> 22:31.815
And like, holy shit.

22:31.817 --> 22:33.083
All right, so let's get to work.

22:47.733 --> 22:49.566
-I grew up in a normal family.

22:49.568 --> 22:50.601
I'm from Arkansas.

22:50.603 --> 22:51.969
I'm a high school dropout.

22:51.971 --> 22:54.571
There's nothing particularly
special about me.

22:54.573 --> 22:58.676
And there's nothing particularly
special about any of us.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.577
But together we can
form a movement.

23:00.579 --> 23:01.378
I am the 99%.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.132
-Get off the street.

23:22.134 --> 23:23.701
Get onto the sidewalk.

23:30.309 --> 23:31.675
[chanting]

23:33.245 --> 23:37.147
-The cops tricked us into
going down a one-way street.

23:37.149 --> 23:39.850
And then they kettled us because
we were on a one-way street.

23:39.852 --> 23:42.019
They were really mean
and kinda violent.

23:42.021 --> 23:42.953
INTERVIEWER: Were you
wearing your Anonymous mask

23:42.955 --> 23:43.754
when you got arrested?

23:43.756 --> 23:44.488
-I was.

23:44.490 --> 23:45.622
-I was too.

23:45.624 --> 23:47.958
I don't want to hide my
face, but sometimes I

23:47.960 --> 23:50.360
feel like I have to.

23:50.362 --> 23:51.895
INTERVIEWER: People
are dismissing

23:51.897 --> 23:53.063
you guys as anarchists.

23:58.604 --> 24:00.037
-Anarchy.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.905
Thousands of occupy protesters
flooded the streets.

24:01.907 --> 24:03.574
MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
The sinister mask,

24:03.576 --> 24:05.509
fashion on Guy Fawkes,
the revolutionary who

24:05.511 --> 24:08.045
attempted to blow up the British
parliament buildings more

24:08.047 --> 24:11.548
than 400 years ago, has
become a worldwide symbol

24:11.550 --> 24:12.916
of anarchy and revolution.

24:12.918 --> 24:14.384
BILL O'REILLY (VOICEOVER):
They are terrorists.

24:14.386 --> 24:16.754
-The other side, the rich
motherfuckers portraying us

24:16.756 --> 24:19.423
all as destructive, mindless
anarchists and so forth,

24:19.425 --> 24:21.358
have really exposed
how reactionary

24:21.360 --> 24:25.262
and how inherently violent
the police state really is.

24:33.038 --> 24:36.039
-I am a journalist!

24:36.041 --> 24:37.541
I am also a protester.

24:37.543 --> 24:39.743
MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
This guy was just arrested,

24:39.745 --> 24:40.978
didn't do anything illegal.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.247
This guy was just
standing around too.

24:47.620 --> 24:50.220
[screaming]

25:11.410 --> 25:14.611
-We can't see the
story from over here.

25:14.613 --> 25:16.079
Remember the press?

25:16.081 --> 25:18.382
How are we supposed to do
our job if you kick us out

25:18.384 --> 25:19.616
of the park?

25:33.432 --> 25:35.999
-The Jews fooled the Germans,
because they got to Germany,

25:36.001 --> 25:38.535
and they were very
serious, rigid people.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.405
And the Germans were like,
oh, they're just like us.

25:41.407 --> 25:44.408
And so they got this
great success in Germany.

25:44.410 --> 25:46.410
And then the
Germans figured out,

25:46.412 --> 25:48.245
oh, they took over
our banks, and it's

25:48.247 --> 25:50.480
hyper-inflated our currency.

25:50.482 --> 25:51.882
Fuck these people.

25:51.884 --> 25:55.018
And perhaps the punishment was
disproportionate to the crime.

25:55.020 --> 25:56.453
-Maybe.

25:56.455 --> 25:58.255
-But the Jews were the
criminal people in Germany,

25:58.257 --> 26:02.025
and they did have
something coming to them.

26:02.027 --> 26:03.060
Just a little.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.061
-Oh my god.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.395
-Perhaps not the Holocaust.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.931
-I certainly don't blame
you for walking away.

26:07.933 --> 26:10.067
It's a good thing
you're a troll.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.436
You can always pull
that kind of troll card.

26:15.441 --> 26:19.743
-He's obviously a
troll and by all

26:19.745 --> 26:25.349
accounts an asshole and highly
offensive and of dubious

26:25.351 --> 26:28.719
moral fiber and
dubious moral standing.

26:28.721 --> 26:29.920
-He is an internet troll.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.489
And for the uninitiated,
that's someone

26:32.491 --> 26:35.425
who just likes to
mess with people

26:35.427 --> 26:37.828
for the sake of
messing with people.

26:37.830 --> 26:41.398
-Trolling is a rhetorical style
that exposes somebody else's

26:41.400 --> 26:44.501
personality flaws by eliciting
a reaction from them that

26:44.503 --> 26:46.837
shows the true nature
of their character.

26:46.839 --> 26:49.539
-He pinpoints your
vulnerability,

26:49.541 --> 26:51.975
and he immediately
starts to exploit it.

26:51.977 --> 26:55.345
But for higher cause, to show
that you're hypocritical,

26:55.347 --> 26:58.749
to show that you have misogyny,
to show that you yourself

26:58.751 --> 27:01.551
are racist while you're yelling
at him for being racist.

27:01.553 --> 27:03.553
-Trolling is in the
Socratic tradition

27:03.555 --> 27:07.057
of questioning everything and
driving people nuts until they

27:07.059 --> 27:09.326
question their assumptions.

27:09.328 --> 27:12.863
And that's basically what a
good troll will aspire to do.

27:12.865 --> 27:16.366
-If I were to name parties
that I think were great trolls,

27:16.368 --> 27:19.503
I'd say Giordano
Bruno, Zeno of Elea,

27:19.505 --> 27:23.040
Jesus Christ, Joseph
Smith, Brigham Young,

27:23.042 --> 27:25.008
I'd definitely name
some parties who

27:25.010 --> 27:27.711
used a very combative
style of rhetoric

27:27.713 --> 27:30.080
but probably nobody alive.

27:30.082 --> 27:31.481
-You meet Weev in
person, and he's

27:31.483 --> 27:32.616
the nicest guy in the world.

27:32.618 --> 27:34.117
He'll hold the
door open for you.

27:34.119 --> 27:35.552
He'll grab you a
soda if you ask him.

27:35.554 --> 27:37.054
And if you meet
him online, he'll

27:37.056 --> 27:38.989
spew a whole bunch
of anti-Semitic crap

27:38.991 --> 27:40.424
and he'll be really mean.

27:40.426 --> 27:43.360
-I like to think of trolling
as a way of expressing

27:43.362 --> 27:44.895
working-class discontent.

27:44.897 --> 27:48.999
I recall recently that Gina
Rinehart called the working

27:49.001 --> 27:53.470
class people of Australia
lazy and without self-control.

27:53.472 --> 27:55.839
Trolling is the
right of said people

27:55.841 --> 28:00.243
to respond by telling her to
perhaps stop eating and get

28:00.245 --> 28:01.645
on a treadmill.

28:01.647 --> 28:04.081
-You say that trolling is
about creating something

28:04.083 --> 28:07.751
that expresses the true
nature of the character.

28:07.753 --> 28:11.521
I wonder how what you
said about Gina Rinehart

28:11.523 --> 28:13.657
exposes the true nature
of the character,

28:13.659 --> 28:15.692
if you're just talking
about her weight.

28:15.694 --> 28:18.662
-When she has inherited wealth
from her father, a bunch

28:18.664 --> 28:21.865
of mines, and she runs around
calling the people that

28:21.867 --> 28:26.636
pull the minerals out of the
ground for her lazy and stupid,

28:26.638 --> 28:28.005
it's disgusting.

28:28.007 --> 28:30.340
It's a level of
decadence and gluttony

28:30.342 --> 28:33.110
that I think speaks not
only through her weight

28:33.112 --> 28:34.411
but her general demeanor.

28:34.413 --> 28:38.448
She's a loud-mouth,
obnoxious idiot.

28:38.450 --> 28:41.618
-I'm not a bigot, except by the
original definition of bigot,

28:41.620 --> 28:44.421
I air my opinion very
loudly without the concern

28:44.423 --> 28:46.356
for others' fucking
cries of help about,

28:46.358 --> 28:48.825
oh, he's saying something
that we don't like to hear.

28:48.827 --> 28:52.262
That's actually the initial
definition of bigot,

28:52.264 --> 28:54.531
before it was associated
with a racist somebody who

28:54.533 --> 28:56.133
loudly airs their opinion.

28:56.135 --> 28:59.202
And it says something
stark now that bigot

28:59.204 --> 29:01.071
is a pejorative term.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.440
There's a quote from Voltaire.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.675
It says, to find
out who rules you,

29:05.677 --> 29:08.278
find the people you
may not criticize.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.280
Why do we all have to
agree with each other?

29:10.282 --> 29:12.616
That's what freedom is about.

29:12.618 --> 29:14.751
I can call you a
disgusting kike,

29:14.753 --> 29:18.155
and we can still live in
the fucking same society.

29:18.157 --> 29:21.024
-He actually is trying to shove
this down everyone's throat.

29:21.026 --> 29:25.228
Freedom of speech at all costs,
as hardcore as I can make it.

29:25.230 --> 29:27.130
-He's a crazy fucker.

29:27.132 --> 29:34.337
But he's our crazy
fucker, I think.

29:34.339 --> 29:36.139
-What was it, the
Gay Nigger Society?

29:36.141 --> 29:37.274
Oh, crap.

29:37.276 --> 29:38.708
I can't say that
on camera, can I?

29:38.710 --> 29:40.877
I should probably, probably
not put that on camera.

29:40.879 --> 29:44.948
-The Gay Nigger Association
has been around,

29:44.950 --> 29:47.651
I think, probably since 2000.

29:47.653 --> 29:50.253
It is a very old
troll organization.

29:50.255 --> 29:53.323
I was elected president
of it in 2010.

30:21.787 --> 30:23.386
FEMALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): The name

30:23.388 --> 30:25.989

short film called

30:25.991 --> 30:29.559
"Gayniggers from Outer Space."

30:29.561 --> 30:31.328
MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
The gay niggers

30:31.330 --> 30:34.698
come from the planet
Anus, and they are much,

30:34.700 --> 30:38.802
much more intelligent than any
other creature in the universe.

30:38.804 --> 30:41.571
-When Hurricane Sandy
swept through New York,

30:41.573 --> 30:43.406
they posed a bunch of
pictures on Twitter

30:43.408 --> 30:45.509
of black people, like,
looting and stuff.

30:45.511 --> 30:48.445
And #SANDYLOOTCREW is what
they called it, the hashtag.

31:04.429 --> 31:06.796
Tons of media
outlets picked it up.

31:06.798 --> 31:10.367
If people were tweeting
pictures of white people

31:10.369 --> 31:12.736
in suits doing TVs, the
media would actually

31:12.738 --> 31:14.538
investigate it and
be like, all right,

31:14.540 --> 31:18.341
this is bullshit, instead of
just reporting that nonsense

31:18.343 --> 31:19.543
without any forethought.

31:23.348 --> 31:25.415
-Trolls in trouble
computer hackers

31:25.417 --> 31:27.317
find themselves on the
wrong side of the law

31:27.319 --> 31:29.452
after breaching AT&T's security.

31:29.454 --> 31:31.888
-I mean, I guess there's a
blurry line between Goatse

31:31.890 --> 31:34.124
Security, was it a
troll or was it a hack?

31:34.126 --> 31:35.692
But I mean, the
name Goatse Security

31:35.694 --> 31:38.795
invokes that terrible image
of, that ruined my childhood.

31:38.797 --> 31:41.531
-He named his company
Goatse Security.

31:41.533 --> 31:45.068
So if you know what
Goatse is G-O-A-T-S-E

31:45.070 --> 31:46.703
I'm not going to explain it.

31:46.705 --> 31:49.573
-Hey, there's this gaping
security flaw here.

32:07.492 --> 32:08.992
-Goatse Security,
who are these guys?

32:08.994 --> 32:10.727
And they're Googling
Goatse, and they're

32:10.729 --> 32:12.128
getting the goatse picture.

32:12.130 --> 32:13.630
-They're called Goatse Security?

32:13.632 --> 32:15.098
Am I pronouncing that correctly?

32:15.100 --> 32:16.433
-Yeah, that's right.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.068
We're analyzing coverage
from Bloomberg, Goatse,

32:18.070 --> 32:19.769
The Register, and Forbes.

32:19.771 --> 32:24.174

the gaping security holes

32:24.176 --> 32:25.508
in your systems.

32:25.510 --> 32:29.512
-A corporation like AT&T
and Apple, the only way

32:29.514 --> 32:32.749
you could really get
to them was literally

32:32.751 --> 32:40.056
to send it to the media and make
a gaping asshole mockery of it.

32:40.058 --> 32:43.493
-We're here today to announce
that our office has filed

32:43.495 --> 32:46.263
criminal charges against
Andrew Auernheimer.

32:57.109 --> 32:59.175
-I never understood.

32:59.177 --> 33:01.878
-The picture that the press
has painted of me is unfair,

33:01.880 --> 33:04.314
and I'd love to have a
discussion, a fair discussion.

33:04.316 --> 33:05.649
Truth triumphs in the end.

33:05.651 --> 33:07.450
-Would you say you've
done anything wrong?

33:07.452 --> 33:09.686
-I don't believe I've
done anything wrong, no.

33:09.688 --> 33:14.824
-What happens when a hacktivist
comes some kid like Weev

33:14.826 --> 33:19.529
comes along and punctures the
invincibility of the United

33:19.531 --> 33:21.698
States government or AT&T?

33:21.700 --> 33:26.836
You minimize the power of these
institutions by doing that.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.938
That's why these kids
have to be stopped.

there's a problem.

36:01.726 --> 36:06.529
I added one to a fucking

36:08.633 --> 36:12.402
to a fucking journalist

-There's always
been contractors.

37:21.106 --> 37:23.506
We had contractors during
the American Revolution.

37:23.508 --> 37:25.475
Let's be real in
terms of history.

37:25.477 --> 37:27.877
We've never had
what were defined

37:27.879 --> 37:29.546
as inherently
governmental functions,

37:29.548 --> 37:34.117
including the centerpiece
functions of the intelligence

37:34.119 --> 37:37.620
system, the most secret
being turned over

37:37.622 --> 37:40.290
for profit to corporations.

37:40.292 --> 37:44.827
If you have that kind of
control because of the accesses

37:44.829 --> 37:48.131
you're granted and the
government giving you

37:48.133 --> 37:54.003
the deep state intelligence,
the deep state data, guess what.

37:54.005 --> 37:57.040
You get to serve the state.

37:57.042 --> 38:00.243
You get to justify its
continued existence.

38:00.245 --> 38:06.316
You're going to color the
world with the mentality

38:06.318 --> 38:10.753
of the state, which is, the
world's a dangerous place.

38:10.755 --> 38:12.789
There's lots of
threats out there.

38:12.791 --> 38:15.224
It's a target-rich environment.

38:15.226 --> 38:18.261
-These are people that are

38:18.263 --> 38:19.862
They're the people

it's not helping anyone.

38:25.604 --> 38:27.103
These are not patriots.

These are people that maybe
have military background.

38:29.741 --> 38:32.041
They might think of
themselves as patriots,

but they are not patriots.

in unconstrained growth

-They're invested in

38:49.461 --> 38:52.228
Hundreds and hundreds
of billions of dollars

38:52.230 --> 38:56.165

38:56.167 --> 38:57.867
ostensibly to practice
I can actually

38:57.869 --> 38:59.469
say it's actually
in the trillions,

38:59.471 --> 39:01.304
the total amount of money.

39:01.306 --> 39:03.840
I would argue it's the largest
redistribution of wealth

39:03.842 --> 39:05.742
in the history of
the United States.

39:05.744 --> 39:08.711
-Wars are not meant to be won,
they're meant to be continuous.

39:08.713 --> 39:11.180
And if you want to
hold a continuous war,

39:11.182 --> 39:14.450
whether in real life
or on the internet,

39:14.452 --> 39:16.619
then you need an enemy
that can't be destroyed.

39:19.057 --> 39:24.127
And Anonymous is impervious
to really being destroyed,

39:24.129 --> 39:25.428
because it's decentralized.

39:25.430 --> 39:26.596
It's everywhere.

39:26.598 --> 39:28.164
And it doesn't
even have to exist.

39:28.166 --> 39:31.834
I mean, they could just say
it exists, and then it would.

39:31.836 --> 39:33.736
And it's sort of
just like terrorism.

39:33.738 --> 39:35.104
Terrorists are everywhere.

39:35.106 --> 39:37.740
Terrorists your neighbor
may be a terrorist.

39:37.742 --> 39:40.476
So we have to remain vigilant.

39:40.478 --> 39:44.013

basically happening online.

39:49.154 --> 39:50.820
-Joins us now to
break it all down.

39:50.822 --> 39:52.388

official declaration

39:52.390 --> 39:54.991
of war against Booz Allen
Hamilton and possibly

39:54.993 --> 39:55.992

40:01.766 --> 40:05.068
within my own group, Project
PM, acquiring more information

40:05.070 --> 40:08.104
and bringing attention to
what's called the intelligence

40:08.106 --> 40:09.305
contracting industry.

40:14.379 --> 40:16.646
-So he has this initiative
called Project PM, which

40:16.648 --> 40:19.449
was a crowdsource wiki that
is supposed to investigate

40:19.451 --> 40:23.119
the mushrooming cyber-security
industrial complex.

40:23.121 --> 40:25.488
-It's a collaborative
research project.

40:25.490 --> 40:27.724
-You're tapping into the
collective consciousness

40:27.726 --> 40:30.460
of the world, which is always
an incredibly powerful thing

40:30.462 --> 40:31.894
to do.

40:31.896 --> 40:34.130
That is going to be the
future model of journalism.

40:34.132 --> 40:38.234
-The collusion in part with
press, mainstream press,

40:38.236 --> 40:41.471
was, we're just going to
sort of look the other way.

40:41.473 --> 40:45.108
We're not going to
actually use the powers

40:45.110 --> 40:46.242
we have available to us.

40:46.244 --> 40:47.810
-He was building
up this database

40:47.812 --> 40:52.148
of who was doing what with who,
what intelligence firms are

40:52.150 --> 40:54.984
working for what government
entities, what outside ones are

40:54.986 --> 40:56.586
working together, what
contracts have they

40:56.588 --> 40:59.222
landed that we don't like you
know, all that type of stuff,

40:59.224 --> 41:01.390
stuff they don't want
the public to know about.

41:09.267 --> 41:13.336
-There were these hacks
going on that we're expected,

41:13.338 --> 41:16.439
these data dumps.

41:16.441 --> 41:19.575
Shit's about to start getting
crazy, if you know what I mean.

41:28.019 --> 41:29.952
-Going through
thousands of emails

41:29.954 --> 41:31.921
is kind of a huge undertaking.

41:31.923 --> 41:33.523
It's a lot of reading.

41:33.525 --> 41:37.026
INTERVIEWER: Did you do that,
go through hundreds of emails?

41:37.028 --> 41:39.929
-Can I say that?

41:39.931 --> 41:41.931
-These people were
contributing to what

41:41.933 --> 41:44.300
they believed was a
journalistic project.

41:44.302 --> 41:47.303
They were contributing
anonymously,

41:47.305 --> 41:50.606
they thought, to help
the cause of journalism.

41:50.608 --> 41:53.075
Obviously Barrett was
onto something, otherwise

41:53.077 --> 41:55.244
there wouldn't have been
this type of reaction.

41:59.984 --> 42:03.019
-41 months, three years'
supervised release, one drug

42:03.021 --> 42:05.321
test within 15 days.

42:05.323 --> 42:08.357
Computer monitoring,
mental health evaluation,

42:08.359 --> 42:14.063
$73,000 restitution to US
Treasury to be given to AT&T.

42:14.065 --> 42:15.097
He reached for his phone.

42:15.099 --> 42:16.365
He reached for something.

42:16.367 --> 42:18.201
They fucking tackled
him, handcuffed him,

42:18.203 --> 42:19.769
took him out for,
like, 15 minutes.

42:19.771 --> 42:22.839
He came back not just in, like,
handcuffs but with the thing

42:22.841 --> 42:26.409
around his waist, the
big chain, laughing.

42:26.411 --> 42:28.578
He's seriously walking
around the courtroom,

42:28.580 --> 42:30.446
just going, like

42:30.949 --> 42:31.914
Like that.

42:31.916 --> 42:33.549
I gave him the thumbs up.

42:48.933 --> 42:51.400
-How dare you be skillful?

42:51.402 --> 42:54.604
How dare you utilize
your knowledge?

42:54.606 --> 42:55.738
-It's fucking absurd.

42:55.740 --> 42:57.039
-And of course
it's AT&T's fault.

42:57.041 --> 42:58.574
They are responsible.

42:58.576 --> 43:01.978
How can you say that the company
that designed the website

43:01.980 --> 43:05.281
is not responsible for
their security flaws?

43:05.283 --> 43:07.516
-So the federal prosecutor
said during Weev's trial

43:07.518 --> 43:10.086
that just because he
has a special skill,

43:10.088 --> 43:12.588
he shouldn't have power
over other people.

43:12.590 --> 43:15.224
That's how they view it.

43:15.226 --> 43:17.460
And it's not incorrect
to say that people

43:17.462 --> 43:20.296
who understand
computers have power.

43:20.298 --> 43:23.132
It's just, I don't think
the answer is coming down

43:23.134 --> 43:26.235
on our prodigies
and our geniuses.

43:26.237 --> 43:27.570
I'll put it this way.

43:27.572 --> 43:28.971
There was a time when
you hacked a company,

43:28.973 --> 43:30.273
and the company hired you.

43:30.275 --> 43:31.974
Now it's you hack a
company, and they come

43:31.976 --> 43:33.776
and they beat the
shit out of you.

43:56.167 --> 44:00.336
-Hackers, hacktivists in prison,
by virutally pointing out

44:00.338 --> 44:02.838
weaknesses in the
very structures

44:02.840 --> 44:06.642
that we depend on
as a common good.

44:06.644 --> 44:09.145
When we weaken the
common good, for what?

44:09.147 --> 44:10.980
We're turning on ourselves.

44:10.982 --> 44:15.651
And any time a country
empire turns on itself

44:15.653 --> 44:21.190
and begins to find
threats from within, well,

44:21.192 --> 44:23.426
that should tell you
how far gone we are.

44:31.869 --> 44:33.336
WEEV (ON COMPUTER):
Howdy, internet.

44:33.338 --> 44:35.371
My internet blogging must
have pissed somebody off.

44:35.373 --> 44:38.741
They have cut off my
fucking TrulinX access

44:38.743 --> 44:43.779
because, of course, we live
in a country with a childishly

44:43.781 --> 44:46.649
authoritarian government
that can't handle anybody

44:46.651 --> 44:49.518
saying anything mean
about it on the internet.

44:49.520 --> 44:50.519
I miss you.

44:50.521 --> 44:51.921
I really do.

44:51.923 --> 44:54.056
There are so many of you that
I can't hopefully I see you

44:54.058 --> 44:56.025
in a couple or years.

44:56.027 --> 44:58.361
I wish I could call each
and every one of you.

45:01.032 --> 45:02.431
I'm still in prison.

45:02.433 --> 45:06.402
I've been denied access
to both sunlight and food.

45:06.404 --> 45:09.305
I can't tweet via the
normal means any longer,

45:09.307 --> 45:12.208
but I will still read
everybody's responses.

45:12.210 --> 45:15.077
They will be snail-mailed to me.

45:15.079 --> 45:17.913
Fucking barbarism!

45:17.915 --> 45:22.885
Keep up the good fight, and
make trouble while I'm gone.

45:22.887 --> 45:27.857
You guys gotta carry the
internet-ruin torch, I suppose.

45:27.859 --> 45:29.558
-Oh, god.

45:29.560 --> 45:34.163
We've that was one of
his better communiques.

45:34.165 --> 45:36.265
-I was outside grabbing
a cup, and I get a call

45:36.267 --> 45:37.767
from an unavailable number.

45:37.769 --> 45:41.070
And it's like, do you want
to accept this toll-free call

45:41.072 --> 45:45.207
from Andrew, from
federal prison?

45:45.209 --> 45:46.609
And I was like,
oh god, it's Weev.

45:46.611 --> 45:48.444
I could barely make
out what he was saying.

45:48.446 --> 45:50.146
But he's like, set
up an Asterisk box

45:50.148 --> 45:52.214
so I can upload
things to SoundCloud.

45:52.216 --> 45:54.383
And I was like, OK, whatever.

46:00.224 --> 46:02.591
He had email access for a month.

46:02.593 --> 46:04.627
Then they took it away,
because they figured out

46:04.629 --> 46:08.230
that he was sending messages
to another person, who

46:08.232 --> 46:10.332
was tweeting them
out from his account.

46:10.334 --> 46:13.436
He and someone else had,
like, code words set up.

46:13.438 --> 46:18.707
So if I said, like, say this to
my mom, or something like that,

46:18.709 --> 46:22.078
then the next line
would be a tweet.

46:22.080 --> 46:24.013
They were trying
to shut him down,

46:24.015 --> 46:26.682
and we found a
way to subvert it.

46:26.684 --> 46:28.350
[music playing]

46:35.827 --> 46:40.830
-The more that they try to make
this go away, the government,

46:40.832 --> 46:42.064
it keeps coming back.

46:42.066 --> 46:43.699
And it'll bring more
attention on Weev.

46:43.701 --> 46:46.669
-It took him a couple of years
to garner 5,000 followers.

46:46.671 --> 46:49.738
And then as soon as he
goes to jail, in a month,

46:49.740 --> 46:52.208
he gets 5,000 more.

47:01.452 --> 47:03.619
It took them a
month to figure out

47:03.621 --> 47:05.421
that we were uploading
to Soundcloud,

47:05.423 --> 47:07.623
even though there was, like,
news articles about it.

47:07.625 --> 47:11.694
And just a few days ago,
we looked at the caller ID,

47:11.696 --> 47:13.863
because we had two
mysterious phone calls.

47:13.865 --> 47:16.899
One of them was from US
Government, all capitals.

47:16.901 --> 47:21.337
And the other one was from
Federal Bureau of Prisons.

47:21.339 --> 47:23.405
Ever since then, we
haven't heard from him.

48:05.249 --> 48:07.483
-Out of kind of the
ashes of LolzSec,

48:07.485 --> 48:10.386
Sabu wants a new
thing, a new group,

48:10.388 --> 48:12.454
a new cause going forward.

48:12.456 --> 48:14.089
And this becomes Antisec.

48:14.091 --> 48:18.093
-With the visuals
of machine guns,

48:18.095 --> 48:20.596
this was no longer
a laughing matter.

48:20.598 --> 48:23.499
And they were not
playing games anymore.

48:23.501 --> 48:27.336
-He was training people to
attack government websites

48:27.338 --> 48:29.438
and attack large
corporations and businesses.

48:41.852 --> 48:43.752
MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
Greetings, pirates.

48:43.754 --> 48:47.656
And welcome to another exciting
Fuck FBI Friday release.

48:47.658 --> 48:49.658
FEMALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
For Fuck FBI Friday,

48:49.660 --> 48:53.729
we are releasing one gigabyte
of private emails and documents.

48:53.731 --> 48:58.133
-It was asking for
trouble, and trouble

48:58.135 --> 49:01.670
came in a way
that like, nobody

49:01.672 --> 49:03.806
could have even written this.

49:09.113 --> 49:13.983
-Antisec culminated in Christmas
of 2011 with the Stratfor hack.

49:13.985 --> 49:16.518
-I remember, like, being home
with my family on Christmas,

49:16.520 --> 49:18.921
glued to my computer,
like, looking over, trying

49:18.923 --> 49:21.223
to interact with my family,
right at the same time,

49:21.225 --> 49:22.758
you know, the Stratfor
stuff's going on.

49:22.760 --> 49:25.160
And I guess there's
that glee that happens,

49:25.162 --> 49:27.796
the glee that happens whenever
like, oh, this happened,

49:27.798 --> 49:28.998
this big hack.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.532
-And some people are just
hanging out, you know,

49:30.534 --> 49:35.070
because it's like, I'm a
devotee to train wrecks.

49:35.072 --> 49:37.840
And other people are, like,
seeking out knowledge.

49:41.445 --> 49:44.780
-Stratfor is a private
intelligence contractor.

49:44.782 --> 49:50.286
They act as an outsourced,
private version of the CIA.

49:50.288 --> 49:52.821
-The National Security
Journalist Joshua Foust

49:52.823 --> 49:58.360
or Foast or Fost
or Faust, maybe, he

49:58.362 --> 50:00.095
said that Stratfor's
no different

50:00.097 --> 50:01.764
than a private investigator.

50:01.766 --> 50:04.166
But PIs don't have
the sort of clientele

50:04.168 --> 50:07.703
that Stratfor had Hunt Oil,
National Oilwell Varco, Emerson

50:07.705 --> 50:10.873
Electric, Dell Computers, and
Northrup Grumman, Lockheed

50:10.875 --> 50:12.608
Martin, Department
of Homeland Security,

50:12.610 --> 50:15.444
Defense Intelligence
Agency, US Marines.

50:15.446 --> 50:17.179
And they don't have
the sort of informants

50:17.181 --> 50:19.948
that Stratfor has Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin

50:19.950 --> 50:21.950
Netanyahu, Mexican
Diplomat Fernando

50:21.952 --> 50:25.554
de la Mora Salcedo, DEA pilot
and sometime supervisor William

50:25.556 --> 50:27.189
F. Dionne, giving
them information

50:27.191 --> 50:31.193
off of JWICS' top secret
classified computer network.

50:31.195 --> 50:33.128
So that's not the
PI that you would

50:33.130 --> 50:35.764
hire to see if your
spouse is cheating on you.

50:35.766 --> 50:36.498
That's Stratfor.

50:49.613 --> 50:51.847
-Cyber thieves made off
with the personal details

50:51.849 --> 50:53.682
of hundreds of thousands
of subscribers.

50:53.684 --> 50:55.117
-They work up to
find that they'd

50:55.119 --> 50:58.487
given an unexpected Christmas
present, the $50,000

50:58.489 --> 51:01.056
between them, to numerous
high-profile charities.

51:03.527 --> 51:05.627
[music playing]

51:29.987 --> 51:33.722
-To take an ex-FBI agents
and use their credit card

51:33.724 --> 51:36.425
to make a donation to the
Red Cross on Christmas Day,

51:36.427 --> 51:37.993
I guess that it's criminal.

51:37.995 --> 51:41.764
But it's also wonderful
in its own way.

51:41.766 --> 51:43.499
-The Stratfor
hack, it's claimed,

51:43.501 --> 51:45.868
also contains
email conversations

51:45.870 --> 51:48.604
between Stratfor
employees and officials

51:48.606 --> 51:49.805
in their own government.

51:49.807 --> 51:51.473
-Every week a
company or an agency,

51:51.475 --> 51:52.574
is this going to get worse?

51:52.576 --> 51:53.976
-I think so.

51:53.978 --> 52:00.048
-People broke into something
and, wow, criminals.

52:00.050 --> 52:01.483
Well, OK.

52:01.485 --> 52:03.619
Even if you want to
call them criminals,

52:03.621 --> 52:05.487
they're coming up with
this information that

52:05.489 --> 52:08.624
looks a lot like
criminal activity.

52:08.626 --> 52:10.626
-The day that
"WikiLeaks" published

52:10.628 --> 52:12.428
the global intelligence
files, which

52:12.430 --> 52:14.296
is what it calls
the Stratfor Leak,

52:14.298 --> 52:17.566
"The Atlantic" wrote an article
titled, Stratfor is a joke,

52:17.568 --> 52:19.935
and so is WikiLeaks for
taking it seriously.

52:19.937 --> 52:22.104
And that was the
very day of the leak,

52:22.106 --> 52:24.807
so surely they didn't
read the 5 million emails

52:24.809 --> 52:26.909
that I've spent more
than a year researching.

52:49.934 --> 52:53.702
The 5 million emails
have just been published.

about it if "The New York

54:45.983 --> 54:47.316
That's just the way that the
media is set up right now.

54:47.318 --> 54:49.318
-There's a lot of people
outside supporting him.

54:49.320 --> 54:51.353
He's gotten a lot of letters.

54:51.355 --> 54:54.289
So, you know

55:11.308 --> 55:17.179
-Hammond's actions are
acts of civil disobedience

55:17.181 --> 55:18.246
fundamentally.

55:18.248 --> 55:20.682
-In hacking Stratfor,
Jeremy Hammond

55:20.684 --> 55:22.751
achieved some degree
of transparency.

55:22.753 --> 55:25.053
It opened our eyes to things
that we needed to see.

55:37.201 --> 55:43.905
-25 years after Bhopal, after
a gas tank released toxic gas

55:43.907 --> 55:48.377
into the city
surrounding the factory,

55:48.379 --> 55:52.214
they were monitoring
dissent and demonstrations

55:52.216 --> 55:54.583
against Dow Chemical.

55:54.585 --> 55:57.185
[chanting]

56:03.961 --> 56:07.029
-Data wants to be free
is the hacker credo.

56:07.031 --> 56:09.197
The real questions
we need to be asking

56:09.199 --> 56:14.403
is, when this data is
shared with people,

56:14.405 --> 56:17.172
who is it benefiting,
and who is it hurting?

56:17.174 --> 56:19.307
Jeremy's apartment,
you know, is just

56:19.309 --> 56:22.511
books scattered about the
floor, books on the shelves.

56:22.513 --> 56:24.680
INTERVIEWER: What could be
more dangerous than books?

56:24.682 --> 56:31.887
-The internet, which is really
just one giant book about all

56:31.889 --> 56:34.089
of us being written
in real time.

56:52.309 --> 56:53.875
-Stop projecting this.

57:07.524 --> 57:08.924
-We love you!

57:08.926 --> 57:10.492
CROWD: We love you!

57:10.494 --> 57:11.526
-We all love you, Jeremy.

57:15.499 --> 57:17.065
-Jeremy, flash your light.

57:20.471 --> 57:23.839
Jeremy, flash your light.

57:23.841 --> 57:26.408
CROWD: Your mom is here!

57:26.410 --> 57:28.410
Your mom is here!

57:28.412 --> 57:31.179
She loves you!

57:31.181 --> 57:33.482
-And I'm proud of you too, boy.

57:48.065 --> 57:51.066
-My name is Barrett
Brown, and I've

57:51.068 --> 57:54.436
been waiting for this
day for about six months.

57:54.438 --> 57:57.038
In a way, I've been
waiting for this day

57:57.040 --> 57:59.307
since I was seven years old.

57:59.309 --> 58:04.813
On March 5, I
received communication

58:04.815 --> 58:06.915
from a certain
individual saying that I

58:06.917 --> 58:10.051
was going to be raided
the next day at my home.

58:10.053 --> 58:12.354
-They go to his
house, his apartment.

58:12.356 --> 58:14.723
And he had spent the
night at his mom's house.

58:14.725 --> 58:16.458
-You know, I go
to my mom's house

58:16.460 --> 58:17.359
and sleep over there sometimes.

58:17.361 --> 58:18.460
We've been very close.

58:18.462 --> 58:20.395
Next morning, I woke
up at 6:30 by my mom's.

58:20.397 --> 58:21.229
She's scared.

58:21.231 --> 58:21.963
I go downstairs.

58:21.965 --> 58:23.098
There's two FBI agents.

58:23.100 --> 58:26.668
One is named Robert Smith.

58:26.670 --> 58:29.638
He is a FBI cyber-crime fellow.

58:29.640 --> 58:32.174
They say, OK, we've raided
your house, your apartment.

58:32.176 --> 58:36.311
Do you have any laptops
here you'd like to give us?

58:36.313 --> 58:38.880
-So they get another warrant
for his mother's house

58:38.882 --> 58:42.684
and find the laptop.

58:42.686 --> 58:47.989
Then they charge his mother
with obstruction of justice.

58:47.991 --> 58:51.526
-When I was seven years old,
I first heard the term FBI.

58:51.528 --> 58:53.929
My parents were fighting a lot.

58:53.931 --> 58:56.832
And my dad would sometimes
get angry and throw things

58:56.834 --> 58:57.999
at my mom.

58:58.001 --> 58:59.301
And part of the
reason for that was

58:59.303 --> 59:01.703
because my dad was being
indicted by the FBI.

59:01.705 --> 59:04.439
And I went from living in a
nice house in Highland Park, one

59:04.441 --> 59:06.074
of the nicest
communities in America,

59:06.076 --> 59:09.010
to living in a two-bedroom
apartment with my mom

59:09.012 --> 59:11.246
and grandma and sharing
a bed with my mom

59:11.248 --> 59:14.482
over the next year, when
I was in third grade.

59:14.484 --> 59:17.953
-They'd gone after his father
and bankrupted his father.

59:17.955 --> 59:20.655
And his father was
eventually found innocent

59:20.657 --> 59:22.791
and apologized to by the court.

59:22.793 --> 59:25.527
So basically, the FBI
ruined his family.

59:31.335 --> 59:33.602
-It was after that day I
realized I'm a bad guy,

59:33.604 --> 59:35.937
and I had no idea beforehand.

59:35.939 --> 59:39.507
And even now, I still
have trouble really

59:39.509 --> 59:42.277
sort of internalizing that.

59:42.279 --> 59:44.012
But if the FBI says
it, it must be true.

59:44.014 --> 59:45.614
And from now on,
I am the bad guy.

59:45.616 --> 59:48.016
-So it's kind of like a quad,
and everybody in the apartment

59:48.018 --> 59:51.286
complex can hear this man
ranting against the FBI

59:51.288 --> 59:52.387
on the balcony.

59:52.389 --> 59:55.790
And I'm getting a
little bit concerned,

59:55.792 --> 59:57.859
but I also want
him to have his

59:57.861 --> 59:59.761
because he's Barrett Brown.

59:59.763 --> 01:00:01.630
He says crazy stuff.

01:00:01.632 --> 01:00:06.601
In the evening, we sit in the
Tinychat, just joking around.

01:01:01.391 --> 01:01:05.860
-Whoa, is Barrett getting
fucking raided by the FBI?

01:01:05.862 --> 01:01:06.828
Holy shit!

01:01:13.236 --> 01:01:15.937
-If you're in the place
getting raided,

01:01:15.939 --> 01:01:18.707
OK, you don't know anything,
because all of a sudden,

01:01:18.709 --> 01:01:21.242
your utilities go out.

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:24.546
And the utilities go
out, because the concern

01:01:24.548 --> 01:01:27.849
is that the concussion
grenades might start a fire.

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:31.653
So they don't want the gas
or electricity running, OK.

01:01:31.655 --> 01:01:34.689
And none of the stuff you
see on television, where

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:38.360
they hit the door with
a battering ram no,

01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:40.829
that door comes down
in one blow, OK?

01:01:40.831 --> 01:01:46.634
And you're down on the floor
with one of these macho jerks

01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:50.038
pointing an assault rifle at
your head, swearing at you

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.573
and telling you
to freeze, or he's

01:01:51.575 --> 01:01:53.708
going to blow your
fucking brains out.

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:57.912
-The second agent came around
in his camo with his gun,

01:01:57.914 --> 01:01:59.781
and he looked at
me as if he didn't

01:01:59.783 --> 01:02:01.316
know there would
be a girl there.

01:02:01.318 --> 01:02:03.351
Barrett's mother came over.

01:02:03.353 --> 01:02:07.856
She sees Barrett
Brown V, and then

01:02:07.858 --> 01:02:13.661
the ampersand over and over
and over again on Twitter.

01:02:13.663 --> 01:02:17.832
Barrett Brown V& is a way
that people communicate that

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:20.168
somebody has been arrested.

01:02:20.837 --> 01:02:22.037
-He's talking shit.

01:02:22.039 --> 01:02:24.572
There's no crime
against talking shit.

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:25.707
But maybe there is now.

01:02:34.785 --> 01:02:37.585
-What kind of threat ends with
how do you like them apples?

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:40.955
It's like it's like, from,
like, 1840 or something

01:02:40.957 --> 01:02:42.157
like that.

01:02:42.159 --> 01:02:43.458
If it was just
threatening the agent

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:44.959
and that's all he was
being charged with,

01:02:44.961 --> 01:02:47.996
I wouldn't even care
about this case.

01:02:47.998 --> 01:02:51.633
Let him and Special Agent Robert
Smith go out back and duke it

01:02:51.635 --> 01:02:54.836
out, or let Special
Agent Smith beat him up

01:02:54.838 --> 01:02:56.304
or whatever he has to do.

01:02:56.306 --> 01:02:59.407
-The second indictment
comes, and then it's

01:02:59.409 --> 01:03:01.443
like a fucking kick in the gut.

01:03:08.552 --> 01:03:10.185
-All these guys
are doing is trying

01:03:10.187 --> 01:03:17.125
to put the fear in him, trying
to pressure him to flip.

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:19.928
Barrett's such a
stubborn asshole,

01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:22.097
that he's never going to flip.

01:03:22.099 --> 01:03:25.867
-Their claim is that he
took a link, copied it

01:03:25.869 --> 01:03:29.871
it's journalistically important
to get the client list pasted

01:03:29.873 --> 01:03:35.743
it into the Project PM chat
room, and in that one move,

01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:39.547
produced criminal
exposure for himself.

01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:41.716
-The Barrett Brown
case is another one

01:03:41.718 --> 01:03:44.152
of these seminal cases,
and the government

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:46.020
wants to send a very
chilling message.

01:03:46.022 --> 01:03:49.057
It's fundamentally a
First Amendment case.

01:03:49.059 --> 01:03:51.759
How dare you hold
up the mirror to us?

01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:56.264
-They called Project PM
a criminal organization.

01:03:56.266 --> 01:03:57.999
And that's what people
freaked out about,

01:03:58.001 --> 01:04:00.502
because there were a whole
bunch of people on that server

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:02.804
editing that wiki, and like,
wait, there's a criminal

01:04:02.806 --> 01:04:04.739
-I think they're after
who, who anyone else?

01:04:04.741 --> 01:04:08.376
Any other names to put on
our list of people to watch?

01:04:08.378 --> 01:04:10.545
-The tingly feelings
of, like, paranoia

01:04:10.547 --> 01:04:13.348
are crawling up my
spine like a spider.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:14.916
They're there for a reason.

01:04:14.918 --> 01:04:16.818
Just because you're
paranoid doesn't

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:19.554
mean they're not after you.

01:04:19.556 --> 01:04:21.756
-So Jeremy Hammond did the hack.

01:04:21.758 --> 01:04:24.025
10 years at this point.

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:27.028
Who's the guy that's looking
at 105 years at this point?

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:28.229
It's Barrett Brown.

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:30.265
And what's the difference?

01:04:30.267 --> 01:04:32.433
He's disseminating
the information.

01:04:32.435 --> 01:04:36.237
He's doing something more
dangerous than what Jeremy did.

01:04:36.239 --> 01:04:38.773
-Here's the message is
sends, from the government

01:04:38.775 --> 01:04:42.177
to the hacktivists, who
are getting great coverage

01:04:42.179 --> 01:04:44.646
and are becoming folk
heroes through the press.

01:04:44.648 --> 01:04:46.281
Don't talk to the
press, because we're

01:04:46.283 --> 01:04:48.082
going to get their
computers and we're

01:04:48.084 --> 01:04:49.484
going to get their
sources and we're

01:04:49.486 --> 01:04:51.186
going to get you through that.

01:04:51.188 --> 01:04:54.489
To the press who are
covering the hacktivists,

01:04:54.491 --> 01:04:57.325
don't cover these hacktivists,
because we're going to get you.

01:05:20.283 --> 01:05:25.453
-I guess what I want, one,
I'm no longer your bitch.

01:05:25.455 --> 01:05:27.589
Two, all of my
charges are dropped.

01:05:27.591 --> 01:05:29.891
Three, all of Barrett
Brown's charges are dropped.

01:05:29.893 --> 01:05:31.092
-That's up to the US Attorney.

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:31.826
-Figure it out.

01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:40.501
FEMALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
Hector Xavier Monsegur

01:05:40.503 --> 01:05:43.371
was responsible for the
arrest of Jeremy Hammond

01:05:43.373 --> 01:05:45.840
and other Anonymous
and LulzSec members.

01:05:47.711 --> 01:05:49.210
MALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): Sources

01:05:49.212 --> 01:05:51.479
say he began cooperating
with the FBI.

01:06:08.331 --> 01:06:13.568
-It like, I felt like my
brains had been blown out,

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:15.770
like it was the last
scene of "The Departed."

01:06:15.772 --> 01:06:18.940
-The FBI arrests Sabu, and
they turn him within a day.

01:06:18.942 --> 01:06:21.909
And they have him back on
the internet within two days.

01:06:21.911 --> 01:06:28.082
-This isn't like some guy going
undercover in the Gambino crime

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:32.120
family in person for years.

01:06:32.122 --> 01:06:34.656
None of us had ever
met him before.

01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:38.626
He was just this guy we
knew from the internet.

01:06:38.628 --> 01:06:41.296
-He talks the talk
so forcefully,

01:06:41.298 --> 01:06:43.364
with that kind of New York
personality you know,

01:06:43.366 --> 01:06:45.867
we are doing the right
thing for the people.

01:06:45.869 --> 01:06:49.003
We are building this
anew from the ground up.

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:56.044
We are taking down the ugly,
evil, capitalist, imperial

01:06:56.046 --> 01:06:59.781
machinery, and we are building
it back up with our own hands.

01:06:59.783 --> 01:07:01.749
My brother, he says.

01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:10.558
-Looking at Sabu's interactions
with reporters during the time

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.727
that he was an FBI
informant, Sabu

01:07:12.729 --> 01:07:14.729
could have easily just
told the reporter,

01:07:14.731 --> 01:07:17.398
like, no, I don't want
to talk to you, go away.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.933
But that's not what he did.

01:07:18.935 --> 01:07:20.802
He engaged in, like, an hour
and a half long conversation

01:07:20.804 --> 01:07:24.572
and then screen-capped
it and handed that
information over to the FBI.

01:07:24.574 --> 01:07:26.007
That's not a free press.

01:07:26.009 --> 01:07:27.975
The government has journalists
under surveillance.

01:07:27.977 --> 01:07:30.678
INTERVIEWER: Do you think the
government's targeting you?

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:32.480
-I hope not.

01:07:32.482 --> 01:07:35.016
I hope I'm not.

01:07:35.018 --> 01:07:36.517
Shit.

01:07:36.519 --> 01:07:40.655
-Everybody's paranoia is just
through the fucking roof.

01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:52.900
-Wait a sec.

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:56.904
If he was working for the
FBI from that moment in June

01:07:56.906 --> 01:08:01.843
to this moment now, they
didn't delete his timeline,

01:08:01.845 --> 01:08:03.811
they didn't try to
hide any of that stuff.

01:08:32.308 --> 01:08:34.041
SABU: Want to speak to me?

01:08:34.042 --> 01:08:37.578
Want to join the fight?

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:39.647
Go to Wall Street and protest.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.808
-Sabu and Jeremy were
partners in crime.

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:10.978
They were the digital Bonnie
and Clyde, if you will.

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:14.749
Except one of them is working
for the FBI the whole time.

01:09:14.751 --> 01:09:21.689
-The FBI is operating in sort of
a new theater, which is online.

01:09:21.691 --> 01:09:24.926
The government likes to
use these hyperbolic terms

01:09:24.928 --> 01:09:28.029
referring to cyber-warfare,
cyber-weapons.

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:46.080
-The feds, by
proxy through Sabu,

01:09:46.082 --> 01:09:50.952
were giving Jeremy the 0days
to get into these websites.

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:52.854
In order to, say,
entrap a terrorist,

01:09:52.856 --> 01:09:55.022
they would sell him
fake explosives.

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:59.827
But instead of giving him fake
explosives, the 0days are real.

01:09:59.829 --> 01:10:03.764
In the hacker world, you either
get in or you don't get in.

01:10:03.766 --> 01:10:08.603
There's no fake hack.

01:10:08.605 --> 01:10:10.771
It wouldn't be a crime
if it was a fake hack.

01:10:26.489 --> 01:10:27.088
-Ugh.

01:10:32.862 --> 01:10:35.630
That's the only way I
could describe it dude.

01:10:35.632 --> 01:10:38.966
She fellated him.

01:10:38.968 --> 01:10:45.406
The amount of cooperation
was truly extraordinary.

01:10:45.408 --> 01:10:48.776
And it was just amaz she just
kept saying it over and over.

01:10:48.778 --> 01:10:50.077
It was truly extraordinary.

01:10:55.485 --> 01:10:59.520
You know and I
gotta say too, I

01:10:59.522 --> 01:11:02.089
don't know what I would
have done in his position.

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:03.624
I really don't.

01:11:06.629 --> 01:11:09.230
You have to walk a mile in
his shoes to understand.

01:11:09.232 --> 01:11:12.033
There's a lot of people that
are going to be mad, though,

01:11:12.035 --> 01:11:15.603
the amount of truly
extraordinary cooperation

01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:17.004
that he gave.

01:11:17.006 --> 01:11:20.174
This was the first time
anybody had ever seen him,

01:11:20.176 --> 01:11:21.542
at least publicly.

01:11:21.544 --> 01:11:22.677
Like, this was real.

01:11:22.679 --> 01:11:24.478
This was finally
coming to a close.

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:27.315
And he was facing
the guideline

01:11:27.317 --> 01:11:29.850
was between 21 and 26 years.

01:11:34.857 --> 01:11:41.095
He walked out of the Manhattan
court complex a free man.

01:11:44.968 --> 01:11:46.367
Yeah.

01:11:46.369 --> 01:11:52.073
-He immediately cooperated with
the FBI when they arrested him.

01:11:52.075 --> 01:11:54.442
And the judge said
that that was probably

01:11:54.444 --> 01:11:57.111
the most significant
aspect of the case,

01:11:57.113 --> 01:12:01.182
was that Sabu flipped so
quickly, which enabled

01:12:01.184 --> 01:12:05.853
the FBI to sort of become
a part of Anonymous

01:12:05.855 --> 01:12:07.455
over a nine-month period.

01:12:07.457 --> 01:12:12.994
They were apparently sitting at
the computer with him at times.

01:12:12.996 --> 01:12:15.630
He had a camera in
his apartment or house

01:12:15.632 --> 01:12:18.399
that was videotaping
him every day.

01:12:18.401 --> 01:12:22.236
He was debriefed
regularly by the FBI.

01:12:22.238 --> 01:12:26.707
-Judge Preska said, and
I quote, I salute you.

01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:30.611
-The prosecution and the
defense sort of built him up

01:12:30.613 --> 01:12:33.214
to be this sort of
conservative folk hero,

01:12:33.216 --> 01:12:38.285
like the model FBI
informant, the person who

01:12:38.287 --> 01:12:42.156
every informant should
live up to be, to the point

01:12:42.158 --> 01:12:45.626
where it made it impossible
for them to give him jail time.

01:12:45.628 --> 01:12:48.496
It would have been
it would've been

01:12:48.498 --> 01:12:50.031
bad for the informant
program for him

01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:52.833
to have worked that
long, to work three years

01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:55.302
and then be sentenced to prison.

01:12:57.907 --> 01:13:00.908
-Sabu pretty much
neutralized Anonymous.

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:01.876
-Yeah.

01:13:01.878 --> 01:13:04.679
-Completely
neutralized Anonymous.

01:13:04.681 --> 01:13:06.547
-And after he went
down, everyone's

01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:08.582
afraid of following any leader.

01:13:08.584 --> 01:13:13.721
And they're also afraid of
starting an operation on their
own.

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:15.289
-In general, nobody
trusts anyone.

01:13:15.291 --> 01:13:18.259
If you go onto any IRC chat,
they're all just talking about,

01:13:18.261 --> 01:13:19.026
you know

01:13:19.028 --> 01:13:19.694
-Who's the fed?

01:13:19.696 --> 01:13:20.728
- you're the fed.

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:23.064
[interposing voices]

01:13:27.837 --> 01:13:29.970
-At the end of the
day, he's just a hacker

01:13:29.972 --> 01:13:32.873
getting used by the government.

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:37.278
-Sabu is the big snitch.

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:42.817
Like, the ninth circle of
Hell is reserved for Sabu.

01:13:42.819 --> 01:13:47.221
Him and Cain and, like, Judas
will be there with Satan.

01:14:38.808 --> 01:14:41.008
BARRETT BROWN: There's
been an unfortunate deficit

01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:43.844
in what people have read
and what people have written

01:14:43.846 --> 01:14:47.548
about an issue that is of
extraordinary importance

01:14:47.550 --> 01:14:48.149
TrapWire.

01:14:54.791 --> 01:14:57.424
-Barrett sort of shines
the light of this stuff.

01:14:57.426 --> 01:14:59.560
He's like, oh my god,
it's actually happening.

01:14:59.562 --> 01:15:01.428
You've got the
emails right there.

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:03.697
-He stumbles across this.

01:15:03.699 --> 01:15:06.300
He stumbles across it,
starts talking about it.

01:15:19.148 --> 01:15:22.750
-TrapWire is software that can
match surveillance data taken

01:15:22.752 --> 01:15:24.785
from multiple closed
circuit cameras

01:15:24.787 --> 01:15:28.088
from across the country.

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:31.025
-Video feeds are fed into
a centralized system that

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:33.861
analyzes them for patterns
of suspicious behavior.

01:15:37.733 --> 01:15:39.533
-To understand
TrapWire, you have

01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:42.970
to understand the
larger context,

01:15:42.972 --> 01:15:47.308
because TrapWire is a critical
piece of the surveillance

01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:48.375
apparatus.

01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:51.579
This is actually doing
very large swath,

01:15:51.581 --> 01:15:53.113
persistent surveillance.

01:15:56.285 --> 01:16:00.721
BARRETT BROWN: In 2007, TrapWire
costs about $1.7 million

01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:03.757
to operate in Los
Angeles County.

01:16:03.759 --> 01:16:05.993
What we know about
how it functions

01:16:05.995 --> 01:16:09.496
is largely gleaned
from those emails.

01:16:09.498 --> 01:16:16.036
-TrapWire has been deployed in
Seattle, in Los Angeles, in DC.

01:16:21.644 --> 01:16:23.811
According to a
Stratfor email, there's

01:16:23.813 --> 01:16:25.946
500 cameras in this
New York City subway

01:16:25.948 --> 01:16:27.715
system equipped with TrapWire.

01:16:27.717 --> 01:16:29.049
JAIME COCHRAN: "The
New York Times"

01:16:29.051 --> 01:16:32.353
said that TrapWire
was only used on 15

01:16:32.355 --> 01:16:36.423
cameras in the entire country,
and that the DHS wrote it off

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:38.592
as a failure.

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:40.961
That's a complete lie.

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:55.476
-We had gone to 38th Street
Station to troll TrapWire.

01:16:55.478 --> 01:16:57.645
And so what troll TrapWire
was for us was essentially

01:16:57.647 --> 01:17:01.015
acting out these things that
the security researcher, Justin,

01:17:01.017 --> 01:17:02.650
and other people
had said, this might

01:17:02.652 --> 01:17:04.418
work to trigger
TrapWire's alarms.

01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:06.720
Sitting their holding my
laptop and looking around,

01:17:06.722 --> 01:17:07.855
a little bit.

01:17:07.857 --> 01:17:09.323
-You were live-tweeting
the video.

01:17:09.325 --> 01:17:10.724
-And you were being ridiculous
about the whole thing.

01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:12.226
-Obvious, yeah.

01:17:12.228 --> 01:17:15.829
-We ate with a senior
official in the Philadelphia
Police Department.

01:17:15.831 --> 01:17:19.099
During this, a homeland security
unit for Philadelphia police

01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:22.202
had come to him and said, Dustin
Slaughter and Kenneth Lipp

01:17:22.204 --> 01:17:24.038
are at 30th Street
Station, and they're

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.439
worried that they were
going to smash cameras,

01:17:25.441 --> 01:17:27.041
that we have something
terrorist in mind.

01:17:27.043 --> 01:17:28.208
It blew our minds
when we found out.

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:29.710
My god, they were
monitoring this.

01:17:29.712 --> 01:17:31.879
They actually were paying
attention and freaked out
about it.

01:17:31.881 --> 01:17:34.081
-They're doing what
everyone's worried about.

01:17:34.083 --> 01:17:37.418
-Anarchists are running all
over the place and smashing,

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:38.485
burning, looting.

01:17:43.392 --> 01:17:45.326
BARRETT BROWN: Coverage
of TrapWire in the US,

01:17:45.328 --> 01:17:47.795
the whole story was
smothered in its crib

01:17:47.797 --> 01:17:51.899
by "The New York Times."

01:17:51.901 --> 01:17:54.435
-It's an open secret
that the mainstream media

01:17:54.437 --> 01:17:57.338
has special access to
the halls of power.

01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:01.542
There was a phrase I
used to hear at NSA

01:18:01.544 --> 01:18:03.844
we're going to tell them
what we want them to hear,

01:18:03.846 --> 01:18:05.579
not what they need to know.

01:18:05.581 --> 01:18:07.881
What we want them to hear.

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:09.450
That's pure manipulation.

01:18:09.452 --> 01:18:11.385
That is CYOP Info Op.

01:18:11.387 --> 01:18:15.255
You're saying, because
you can, you're

01:18:15.257 --> 01:18:16.523
controlling the narrative.

01:18:21.597 --> 01:18:22.429
-Hail victory!

01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:25.032
-Go, go, go, go, go.

01:18:38.814 --> 01:18:39.546
-What?

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:40.414
-Yeah, dude.

01:18:50.259 --> 01:18:53.394
-And my magazines and my
newspapers and my mail.

01:19:02.938 --> 01:19:05.472
I spent the majority
of my time in the SHU.

01:19:08.677 --> 01:19:12.079
They were like, if you continue,
we're going to force-feed you.

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:15.983
And I'm like, well, you're
gonna force-feed me.

01:19:15.985 --> 01:19:20.220
But hey, I ain't
backing down, you know?

01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:22.389
-The infamous computer
hacker known by his alias

01:19:22.391 --> 01:19:26.126
Weev is a free man after
more than a year behind bars.

01:19:26.128 --> 01:19:28.662
An appeals court has now
overturned his conviction.

01:19:52.488 --> 01:19:57.424
-Time behind bars has
made Weev even more
outspoken than before.

01:19:57.426 --> 01:20:00.928
-I can't watch my society rot
when a bunch of federal scum

01:20:00.930 --> 01:20:02.663
just want to throw
anybody that they

01:20:02.665 --> 01:20:04.031
disagree with in a prison cell.

01:20:04.033 --> 01:20:06.166
It's the end of
the West right now,

01:20:06.168 --> 01:20:07.901
and we've got to fight for it.

01:20:07.903 --> 01:20:09.503
Somebody has to.

01:20:09.505 --> 01:20:13.740
-You have no instincts to flee,
like Edward Snowden or Julian

01:20:13.742 --> 01:20:14.575
Assange?

01:20:14.577 --> 01:20:15.242
-I'm not running.

01:20:15.244 --> 01:20:15.742
This is my country.

01:20:24.487 --> 01:20:26.787
So this case is at
every step of the way

01:20:26.789 --> 01:20:29.756
from the initial
criminal complaint

01:20:29.758 --> 01:20:32.826
to my time in prison has
always been about my speech.

01:20:32.828 --> 01:20:34.661
And they've wanted
to silence me.

01:20:37.566 --> 01:20:39.566
They further
punished me in prison

01:20:39.568 --> 01:20:44.471
and subjected me to conditions
above and beyond any

01:20:44.473 --> 01:20:49.276
of the other prisoners at my
facility because of my speech.

01:20:49.278 --> 01:20:52.646
They wanted me to disappear
from public view and memory.

01:20:55.684 --> 01:21:03.390
It was inside the
SHU inside the SHU

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:11.398
There's an author,
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:14.668
He was one of the
few authors that

01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:18.939
kept writing after Stalin
told all the authors that they

01:21:18.941 --> 01:21:23.143
weren't allowed to write
any literature that was
compelling anymore.

01:21:23.145 --> 01:21:24.578
And he ended up in a prison
system called the Gulag.

01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:28.348
And he describes there
the steps that they

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:30.651
do to try to break you down.

01:21:30.653 --> 01:21:34.154
And I kept checking off the
bullet points that he listed.

01:21:34.156 --> 01:21:37.391
He has, like, a 30
bullet point list

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:40.427
of all the various
interrogatory methods

01:21:40.429 --> 01:21:43.096
that they used in Soviet Russia.

01:21:43.098 --> 01:21:45.365
Temperature extremes
are one of them,

01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:50.070
and they'll turn up the AC
to freezing temperatures

01:21:50.072 --> 01:21:51.405
while he was sleeping.

01:21:51.407 --> 01:21:55.576
And then they'll pump up
the heat during the day.

01:21:55.578 --> 01:21:58.745
And they come and
like, I couldn't

01:21:58.747 --> 01:22:01.615
sleep because they would bang on
the door every once in a while.

01:22:01.617 --> 01:22:04.218
And they'll shine the
flashlight in your eyes

01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:05.819
and keep waking you up at night.

01:22:05.821 --> 01:22:08.355
They'll put you on a bunk, and
then you can't even sit up.

01:22:08.357 --> 01:22:10.757
And there's a light
right next to your head.

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:13.460
And it's pretty terrible.

01:22:13.462 --> 01:22:15.929
No doubt about it,
it's pretty terrible.

01:22:28.210 --> 01:22:30.177
-The surveillance
state's already here.

01:22:30.179 --> 01:22:31.511
It's already here.

01:22:31.513 --> 01:22:33.313
We're constantly on camera.

01:22:33.315 --> 01:22:35.315
Like, we can't put
that back in the box.

01:22:35.317 --> 01:22:37.351
Like, we can fret about
it and say, oh gosh,

01:22:37.353 --> 01:22:38.819
we need more controls.

01:22:38.821 --> 01:22:41.288
That infrastructure is there,
and it's not going away.

01:22:41.290 --> 01:22:43.123
-They can watch us
through our webcams.

01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:45.559
They can listen
through our phones.

01:22:45.561 --> 01:22:49.296
There's no privacy
left, virtually.

01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:53.767
We are the most watched,
surveilled, monitored,

01:22:53.769 --> 01:22:58.538
eavesdropped population in
the history of the human race.

01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:01.575
-If you have nothing to hide,
as justification for violating

01:23:01.577 --> 01:23:03.610
your rights, then you have
nothing to worry about.

01:23:03.612 --> 01:23:05.345
You know where that
phrase came from?

01:23:05.347 --> 01:23:07.881
Goebbels from the Nazi era.

01:23:07.883 --> 01:23:08.949
Nothing to hide?

01:23:08.951 --> 01:23:11.018
That means there is no privacy.

01:23:12.354 --> 01:23:15.489
-I left Iran to
come here, and now I

01:23:15.491 --> 01:23:18.158
can't have security or privacy?

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:20.727
All we want is just
fucking live our lives.

01:23:20.729 --> 01:23:23.330
Half of us, we don't
even give a shit,

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:26.033
if we could all be left alone.

01:23:26.035 --> 01:23:29.503
It's my right by
birth to have privacy.

01:23:29.505 --> 01:23:31.972
-They want to own you.

01:23:31.974 --> 01:23:35.809
That's a power relationship
superior, inferior.

01:23:35.811 --> 01:23:39.546
-If I know every single thing
about you, about what you

01:23:39.548 --> 01:23:42.316
think, how you reason,
what your fears are,

01:23:42.318 --> 01:23:44.518
what you're planning,
what you're doing,

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.386
and you know nothing
about me, because I'm

01:23:46.388 --> 01:23:49.756
shielding my behavior
behind a wall of secrecy,

01:23:49.758 --> 01:23:51.825
I have incredible
power over you.

01:23:51.827 --> 01:23:53.660
The power imbalance
between us is immense,

01:23:53.662 --> 01:23:57.464
because I can now manipulate
you, I can threaten you,

01:23:57.466 --> 01:24:00.033
I can alter your behavior
in all sorts of ways,

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:02.302
I can anticipate your
behavior, I can prevent you

01:24:02.304 --> 01:24:03.804
from doing things
that you're planning,

01:24:03.806 --> 01:24:06.440
I can prepare in defense
of what you're doing,

01:24:06.442 --> 01:24:08.508
I can always stay many
steps ahead of you.

01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:10.444
-This mentality is pathological.

01:24:10.446 --> 01:24:13.280
You have to understand
the mindset.

01:24:13.282 --> 01:24:17.417
You have to understand
the psychology

01:24:17.419 --> 01:24:20.620
behind those who want
to know everything.

01:24:20.622 --> 01:24:23.623
That means anything
hidden, anything private,

01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:26.226
anything sovereign
is a direct threat

01:24:26.228 --> 01:24:28.462
to the surveillance state.

01:24:28.464 --> 01:24:33.133
-The capacity of this
agency to spy on people

01:24:33.135 --> 01:24:34.735
and to know everything
that they do

01:24:34.737 --> 01:24:39.906
is so extreme and awesome, at
any moment pure totalitarianism

01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:42.376
could be imposed, and
the American people

01:24:42.378 --> 01:24:43.844
would have no place to hide.

01:24:43.846 --> 01:24:45.912
-Security and surveillance
state is put into place

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:49.516
in order to keep a
population captive.

01:24:49.518 --> 01:24:51.184
And they now have
all the mechanisms

01:24:51.186 --> 01:24:53.220
to do it absolute
iron control,

01:24:53.222 --> 01:24:55.389
over-arrestive
population, should

01:24:55.391 --> 01:24:57.791
the population become restive?

01:24:57.793 --> 01:25:01.328
-The United States
unchained itself fully

01:25:01.330 --> 01:25:02.562
from the Constitution.

01:25:02.564 --> 01:25:03.830
People still don't
fully appreciate it.

01:25:03.832 --> 01:25:05.165
We talk about mass
surveillance, all

01:25:05.167 --> 01:25:06.700
this stuff- no,
they've unchained.

01:25:06.702 --> 01:25:08.568
This is an alien
form of government.

01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:10.904
It's completely
anathema to democracy.

01:25:10.906 --> 01:25:13.507
It's completely anathema, but
obviously the government's

01:25:13.509 --> 01:25:15.542
not going to come out
and say, hey, guess what?

01:25:15.544 --> 01:25:17.944
We're under national
emergency conditions.

01:26:03.926 --> 01:26:07.194
-I'm going to continue
hitting large companies

01:26:07.196 --> 01:26:08.795
and institutional powers.

01:26:08.797 --> 01:26:12.265
I'm not going to take
no shit from nobody.

01:26:12.267 --> 01:26:14.434
Fuck them if they
can't take a joke.

01:26:40.863 --> 01:26:43.730
-I was not going to sit
still and remain silent,

01:26:43.732 --> 01:26:46.666
because if I had
remained silent, I

01:26:46.668 --> 01:26:51.805
myself would have been complicit
in the conduct of a crime

01:26:51.807 --> 01:26:55.075
against the sovereignty
of who we are as people.

01:26:55.077 --> 01:27:00.080
That's We the People, capital
W and capital P, We the People.

01:27:10.959 --> 01:27:14.094
-You can just sign off.

01:27:14.096 --> 01:27:16.363
Like, you don't have to
be a victim of trolling.

01:27:16.365 --> 01:27:18.565
Like, you can just
turn off the internet.

01:27:42.991 --> 01:27:44.791
-Sabu got off.

01:27:44.793 --> 01:27:47.894
Judge Preska and the
attorneys and the defenders

01:27:47.896 --> 01:27:51.231
got on their knees
and fellated him.

01:27:51.233 --> 01:27:53.266
-That's, like, a
lot more sex than I

01:27:53.268 --> 01:27:55.035
remember going on
in the courtroom.

01:27:55.037 --> 01:27:57.470
-Don't limit your activism
to just the mere world

01:27:57.472 --> 01:27:58.371
of computers.

01:27:58.373 --> 01:27:59.940
Take it to the streets.

01:27:59.942 --> 01:28:02.275
We need more foot soldiers in
the streets to fuck up shit.

01:28:09.685 --> 01:28:12.619
-"Dallas, Texas, native Mr.
Brown joins other infamous

01:28:12.621 --> 01:28:13.920
Texans who fought
the government,

01:28:13.922 --> 01:28:16.323
such as Branch Davidians
at Waco, Texas."

01:28:16.325 --> 01:28:18.058
Fucking really?

01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:18.992
Really?

01:28:18.994 --> 01:28:20.393
The Branch Davidians?

01:28:20.395 --> 01:28:21.094
Really?

01:28:21.096 --> 01:28:21.828
Fuck you.

01:29:12.047 --> 01:29:15.048
