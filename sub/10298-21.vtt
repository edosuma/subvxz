01:15.634 --> 01:18.167
Okay, honey.
It's ready.

01:20.400 --> 01:23.467
All right. What would you
like to start with?

01:23.467 --> 01:25.200
Something light.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.701
The gas bill.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.167
Pen.

01:33.167 --> 01:34.334
Bromo.

01:37.400 --> 01:38.634
Mortgage.

01:39.701 --> 01:40.801
Pepto.

01:44.100 --> 01:45.601
Department store.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.767
Shotgun.

01:53.901 --> 01:56.601
Al...can't you
go any faster?

01:56.601 --> 01:58.801
Let's pretend
we're upstairs.

01:58.801 --> 02:00.968
I know.
I'll yell, "Not yet."

02:00.968 --> 02:03.868
That always seems
to speed you up.

02:03.868 --> 02:06.200
Oh, I'm sorry, Peg.
Am I bringing you down?

02:06.200 --> 02:07.934
Well, let me try
another attitude.

02:07.934 --> 02:09.834
* Oh, man, we're broke
Cha, cha, cha *

02:09.834 --> 02:11.667
* Everybody flat broke
Cha, cha, cha *

02:11.667 --> 02:13.501
* Living in the gutter
Cha, cha, cha *

02:13.501 --> 02:16.234
* Early grave
Cha, cha, cha *

02:16.234 --> 02:19.033
All right. Now,
everybody, shoot me!

02:25.167 --> 02:27.167
Kiss me
with a hammer.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.300
What's the matter, honey?

02:30.300 --> 02:31.868
It's that school place.

02:31.868 --> 02:35.601
They want me to be a stupid
intern at some stupid station.

02:35.601 --> 02:37.167
Channel 83.

02:37.167 --> 02:39.267
Nobody watches Channel 83.

02:39.267 --> 02:43.701
<i>Cosmic Dog is
a pretty darn good show.</i>

02:43.701 --> 02:46.234
God, it's so unfair.

02:46.234 --> 02:47.767
They gave all
the cool assignments

02:47.767 --> 02:50.167
to the kids
who were awake.

02:51.634 --> 02:53.367
They're gonna
make me work nights.

02:53.367 --> 02:54.701
So now, come dawn,

02:54.701 --> 02:56.267
when we're wondering
where you are,

02:56.267 --> 02:58.067
we'll just check
the TV station

02:58.067 --> 02:59.467
instead of the bushes.

03:00.868 --> 03:04.133
Oh, go dance alone
in your underwear.

03:04.133 --> 03:06.000
Al, the kids
are arguing again.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.300
Would you talk to them?

03:07.300 --> 03:11.634
Talking to them won't
make them go away, Peg.

03:11.634 --> 03:14.834
Besides, I have to concentrate
on this raise thing.

03:14.834 --> 03:16.934
It's time I got
my dignity back.

03:16.934 --> 03:19.167
Come on, Bud, let's get
some Windex and a squeegee

03:19.167 --> 03:20.267
and hit the off-ramps.

03:22.834 --> 03:25.200
Daddy needs to
buy a power tie.

03:26.467 --> 03:28.033
Mom, what am I
gonna do?

03:28.033 --> 03:29.701
If I don't do
this stupid intern thing,

03:29.701 --> 03:31.434
I won't graduate.

03:31.434 --> 03:34.734
Hm...graduation.

03:34.734 --> 03:37.968
Kelly...maybe it's time
we had a little talk.

03:37.968 --> 03:39.501
You're getting
to be a big girl now,

03:39.501 --> 03:41.434
and there's something
I've been putting off

03:41.434 --> 03:43.067
telling you for a while.

03:43.067 --> 03:44.801
But time is
slipping by quickly,

03:44.801 --> 03:48.400
and I don't want you to learn
about it on the street.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.801
Honey, ahem...there is
a thing out there

03:51.801 --> 03:54.234
that men will
want you to do.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.000
In fact, they'll
expect it.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.434
Now, no woman
really enjoys it,

03:59.434 --> 04:02.434
but we do it,
get them to marry us

04:02.434 --> 04:04.868
and then never
have to do it again.

04:07.033 --> 04:10.567
That horrible thing
is called...

04:10.567 --> 04:13.067
work.

04:13.067 --> 04:14.701
Hold me, Mom.
I'm scared.

04:14.701 --> 04:18.067
Aw, I know. I know.

04:18.067 --> 04:20.834
But, honey, the important thing
is to do it early,

04:20.834 --> 04:22.100
whileyou're still young.

04:22.100 --> 04:26.234
That way...when your husband
comes home reeking of beer,

04:26.234 --> 04:30.200
wanting some loving, you'll
follow that fat rump upstairs.

04:31.467 --> 04:35.000
Because you'll know...
that no matter how disgusting

04:35.000 --> 04:37.634
the next three
minutes will be...

04:37.634 --> 04:42.133
it still beats
the hell out of work.

04:42.133 --> 04:44.834
Thank you, Mom.
You're so wise.

04:44.834 --> 04:46.133
Ah, well.

04:46.133 --> 04:48.634
You know, you can't sit
on a sofa 20 hours a day

04:48.634 --> 04:50.100
and not learn something.

04:55.968 --> 04:57.467
Okay, who ordered
the coffee?

04:57.467 --> 04:58.701
I did.

05:05.901 --> 05:06.901
Who is that?

05:06.901 --> 05:08.167
It's our new intern.

05:08.167 --> 05:11.267
But what we need is a gimmick
to get the ratings up.

05:11.267 --> 05:14.767
Look. I made it cloudy
way up in the pointy states.

05:22.334 --> 05:24.200
Come on, Al.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.234
What is it
you're gonna tell us?

05:26.234 --> 05:27.734
Is it about
your raise?

05:27.734 --> 05:29.267
Ah, ah, ah, Peg.

05:29.267 --> 05:31.868
Not till the whole
family's here.

05:31.868 --> 05:33.100
This news is so big,

05:33.100 --> 05:34.734
I even want the girl
to hear it.

05:37.868 --> 05:39.868
There we go.

05:39.868 --> 05:41.434
It's time.

05:41.434 --> 05:42.634
Family--

05:42.634 --> 05:45.601
Mom, Dad, I just got a job
for $1000 a week.

05:45.601 --> 05:47.868
Are you kidding me?

05:47.868 --> 05:49.467
I can't believe that.

05:49.467 --> 05:50.734
Oh, we're
rich!
We're rich!

05:52.100 --> 05:53.534
Oh, Mom.

05:53.534 --> 05:56.767
Oh, Mom. She's
finally turning pro.

06:00.300 --> 06:03.100
Oh, a successful
Bundy.

06:03.100 --> 06:04.868
Oh, Al...

06:04.868 --> 06:07.501
come and brownnose
with us.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.567
Why should I?
You're already doing a good job.

06:10.601 --> 06:12.901
I'm sorry, honey.

06:12.901 --> 06:14.801
You had
an announcement too.

06:14.801 --> 06:17.968
Did not.

06:17.968 --> 06:19.567
Come on, Dad,
tell us.

06:19.567 --> 06:21.067
We're really
interested.

06:21.067 --> 06:23.868
Well, okay.

06:23.868 --> 06:26.734
Well, today I made
my stand at work.

06:26.734 --> 06:28.734
I fought, I threw myself
on the ground,

06:28.734 --> 06:30.100
I screamed like a woman.

06:31.167 --> 06:32.968
But I finally got
what I was after.

06:32.968 --> 06:36.701
Folks, you're looking at a man
with a $5 a week raise.

06:39.200 --> 06:41.801
Gee, Kelly...
Kelly...

06:47.501 --> 06:50.000
Hurry up, Dad.
She's gonna be
on in a minute.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.434
Well, I still think it's
a pretty unfair world

06:52.434 --> 06:54.801
when someone who doesn't even
have a high school diploma

06:54.801 --> 06:56.367
makes more than
someone important,

06:56.367 --> 06:59.601
like a Ph.D.
or a...shoe salesman.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.934
Oh, honey...you may
not make much money,

07:03.934 --> 07:06.634
but Kelly will never have
the satisfaction of saying,

07:06.634 --> 07:10.467
"I used to play
a little high-school ball."

07:12.033 --> 07:14.200
You know, son, one day
you'll have a girl

07:14.200 --> 07:18.501
just like the girl
that's killing
dear old Dad.

07:18.501 --> 07:19.801
Shut up, Al.

07:19.801 --> 07:21.200
Oh, she's coming on.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.067
<i>ANNOUNCER:
And now the Action Weather,</i>

07:23.067 --> 07:26.234
<i>with meteorologist
Bill Palomino.</i>

07:26.234 --> 07:29.534
<i>And, yes, girls,
I'm still single.</i>

07:29.534 --> 07:31.934
<i>Now, let's have some fun.
Let's do weather.</i>

07:31.934 --> 07:33.467
<i>It's still sunny
here in Chicago,</i>

07:33.467 --> 07:34.634
<i>but up in Washington,</i>

07:34.634 --> 07:36.067
<i>they're expecting
more clouds.</i>

07:36.067 --> 07:37.267
<i>Right, weather bunny?</i>

07:37.267 --> 07:39.000
<i>Right-o,
Bill.</i>

07:45.067 --> 07:48.767
<i>Look, folks, it stays up there
all by itself.</i>

07:51.367 --> 07:52.868
<i>And we have
tornado warnings for--</i>

07:52.868 --> 07:54.367
<i>Excuse me, Bill.</i>

07:54.367 --> 07:56.934
<i>But I have a little
inside tip for our viewers.</i>

07:56.934 --> 07:58.334
<i>You see these
little clouds?</i>

07:58.334 --> 08:00.200
<i>Now, they won't stick
to just anything.</i>

08:00.200 --> 08:01.801
<i>Look.</i>

08:04.334 --> 08:07.434
<i>Now, kids,
don't try this at home.</i>

08:07.434 --> 08:09.367
<i>Back to you, Bill.</i>

08:11.834 --> 08:15.801
Oh. Look at her, Al.

08:15.801 --> 08:19.100
The product
of our love.

08:19.100 --> 08:22.868
That's not surprising,
is it, Peg?

08:22.868 --> 08:25.634
Oh, Al, I know you're
a little down,

08:25.634 --> 08:27.567
what with Kelly
making more in a day

08:27.567 --> 08:29.534
than you made
in the '80s.

08:30.868 --> 08:32.634
But, as far
as I'm concerned,

08:32.634 --> 08:34.234
you're still the man
in the house.

08:34.234 --> 08:35.933
Thanks, Peg.
What's for dinner?

08:35.933 --> 08:36.933
Veal.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.267
I hate veal.

08:38.267 --> 08:40.801
Oh, I know,
but Kelly wanted it.

08:42.133 --> 08:44.667
And so,
as you can all see,

08:44.667 --> 08:47.300
Kelly Bundy overcame
blinding poverty

08:47.300 --> 08:49.634
to become the star
she is today.

08:49.634 --> 08:51.801
And remember...later,
there will be a chance

08:51.801 --> 08:54.367
for all of you to purchase
some of her bath water.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.534
So now,
if you'll just wave

08:57.534 --> 08:59.601
to Kelly's mother
on the way out...

09:01.267 --> 09:02.467
We'll conclude
the tour

09:02.467 --> 09:04.200
with the car that Kelly
was conceived in

09:04.200 --> 09:05.934
and the garage
where she was born.

09:11.367 --> 09:14.100
Oh, Al...isn't
this exciting?

09:14.100 --> 09:16.501
He didn't even
introduce me, Peg.

09:16.501 --> 09:18.200
Well, you know,
we discussed it,

09:18.200 --> 09:21.067
but the legend seemed
to work better with you dead.

09:21.067 --> 09:23.868
Oh. Oh.

09:23.868 --> 09:26.868
Oh, God. What a day.

09:26.868 --> 09:28.868
Clouds just
would not stick.

09:31.300 --> 09:32.501
I'm bleeding for you.

09:32.501 --> 09:35.100
Pass me a bread stick,
dear.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.801
Al...she reaches
for a living.

09:37.801 --> 09:40.100
She should relax
when she's at home.

09:40.100 --> 09:42.400
Excuse your father, honey.
He's an idiot.

09:43.801 --> 09:47.834
Peggy...tell Bud I don't have
to pay to get in here.

09:47.834 --> 09:49.100
That's
right, Bud.

09:49.100 --> 09:52.267
I sold her
a lifetime pass yesterday.

09:54.033 --> 09:56.634
Kelly, I've got
to ask you a question.

09:56.634 --> 09:58.234
I am sorry,
but I am not allowed

09:58.234 --> 10:01.801
to reveal tomorrow's weather
until tomorrow.

10:01.801 --> 10:03.467
To hell with the weather.

10:03.467 --> 10:06.267
Give me the poop on Palomino.

10:06.267 --> 10:07.801
Boy, there's one warm front

10:07.801 --> 10:09.934
I wouldn't mind settling
over me for a few days.

10:12.734 --> 10:14.701
Well, actually,
he's not the nice man

10:14.701 --> 10:15.801
that he appears to be.

10:15.801 --> 10:17.434
I mean, just today
after the weather,

10:17.434 --> 10:19.734
when I, like America,

10:19.734 --> 10:23.534
wondered aloud
where East Dakota was...

10:23.534 --> 10:25.234
he went
to the station manager

10:25.234 --> 10:27.501
and said,
"Either the bimbo goes or I go."

10:27.501 --> 10:29.267
Well, it looks
like things

10:29.267 --> 10:31.367
will start to get back
to normal around here now.

10:31.367 --> 10:33.334
So I guess the next tour
comes through here,

10:33.334 --> 10:35.767
you'll be selling
my bath water.

10:35.767 --> 10:38.133
Yeah, right, Al.

10:38.133 --> 10:41.501
Like I really kept it
for five years.

10:44.334 --> 10:46.000
I'm sorry you lost
your job, Kelly.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.100
My job? They canned him
like a tuna.

10:51.467 --> 10:53.667
I mean...after all,

10:53.667 --> 10:55.901
I am the one
in the short skirt.

10:55.901 --> 10:59.901
And you always
will be, honey.

10:59.901 --> 11:03.334
Oh, your first job.
How exciting.

11:03.334 --> 11:05.434
Working during
your high school years.

11:05.434 --> 11:06.968
That's what I did.

11:06.968 --> 11:09.300
While everyone else
was out having fun.

11:09.300 --> 11:12.400
But I was saving
for a college education.

11:12.400 --> 11:13.701
And that's
what it went for.

11:13.701 --> 11:17.734
My sister's
college education.

11:17.734 --> 11:20.100
Ah! And, of course,
Mother wouldn't dream

11:20.100 --> 11:21.334
of asking her to work.

11:21.334 --> 11:24.801
No. Because sis was too
pretty and too delicate

11:24.801 --> 11:27.200
to be hauling around
slabs of meat.

11:29.267 --> 11:30.868
Now she's a physicist,

11:30.868 --> 11:32.234
and I can stuff
a sausage

11:32.234 --> 11:34.968
with one hand
tied behind my back.

11:34.968 --> 11:36.367
So everything
worked out.

11:36.367 --> 11:38.834
I guess what
I'm trying to say is...

11:38.834 --> 11:42.567
what happened
to my life? My youth?

11:42.567 --> 11:44.000
Peg, do you mind,
here?

11:47.434 --> 11:49.434
All I want is
my fair share.

11:49.434 --> 11:53.234
To go to the prom.
To work on a float.

11:53.234 --> 11:55.067
To have a date
with a boy

11:55.067 --> 11:57.200
instead of a pork shoulder
I'd call Vinnie.

11:58.367 --> 12:01.000
Peggy, do I deserve
to be treated like this?

12:01.000 --> 12:02.400
I mean--

12:04.167 --> 12:05.534
[MOUTHS WORDS]

12:07.367 --> 12:10.434
