32:37.163 --> 32:41.417
Brazil is the world's largest producer
of animal protein.

32:42.502 --> 32:49.425
The biggest meat-processing companies
in the world are here in Brazil.

34:43.122 --> 34:46.000
Official support for JBS came from BNDES,

34:46.501 --> 34:48.753
which is Brazil's
national development bank.

34:51.089 --> 34:57.887
And BNDES is public money, taxpayer money,
which is going to these companies.

34:57.970 --> 34:59.680
And it was a lot of money.

35:58.197 --> 36:05.163
We went there and bought the American,
Australian and European companies.

36:06.914 --> 36:10.793
And now we're leaders there. Why can't
the Brazilians be leaders? We can.

36:10.877 --> 36:14.338
And the big move by them to really
become a monstrous company...

36:14.797 --> 36:18.467
with the huge revenue that they have

36:18.551 --> 36:20.469
was the acquisition of Pilgrim's.

37:17.151 --> 37:23.324
Starting in 2012, JBS purchased
three different facilities,

37:23.407 --> 37:29.038
and all of us became JBS contract farmers.

37:29.121 --> 37:35.253
There is no other company
that serves us, that we can produce for.

37:35.336 --> 37:39.507
The way we work, the producers don't know
how much they are going to earn.

37:40.341 --> 37:44.220
Or they have a table, a pay table
that they don't really understand.

37:50.768 --> 37:55.523
We earn less than we should to maintain
the structure, to keep working.

38:06.617 --> 38:10.579
The relationship between
producers and JBS...

38:10.663 --> 38:16.127
it's a very difficult relationship.
Producers are scared of speaking out.

38:16.627 --> 38:18.587
I'm producing chicken for them.

38:18.671 --> 38:20.881
I consider myself to be a good producer.

38:20.965 --> 38:22.883
I always deliver above the average...

38:22.967 --> 38:25.636
but the partnership is restricted
to what's on paper.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.723
Nothing more. I don't have any benefits.

38:28.806 --> 38:32.643
All the investments I have to make here,
I have to pay the costs.

38:51.078 --> 38:54.665
We told BNDES...

38:55.333 --> 38:59.670
to stop giving financing
to the business,

38:59.754 --> 39:01.922
because it isn't a profitable investment.

39:02.006 --> 39:06.635
Because it isn't profitable

39:06.719 --> 39:10.181
and doesn't cover
the labor cost of its partners.

39:17.897 --> 39:20.649
As a Brazilian citizen who pays taxes,

39:20.733 --> 39:25.780
and especially as a producer of food
for Brazil and the world,

39:25.863 --> 39:29.325
we felt extremely disrespected.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.840
In the previous election in 2014,

39:44.924 --> 39:47.343
JBS was the biggest donor...

39:48.219 --> 39:50.137
to political campaigns in Brazil.

39:50.221 --> 39:54.725
They donated almost
400 million Brazilian reals,

39:54.809 --> 39:57.311
which is about $100 million.

39:58.312 --> 40:04.443
JBS has a very strong influence
over Brazilian Congress.

40:04.527 --> 40:07.279
They are among
the largest campaign donors.

40:07.363 --> 40:10.032
They have a number of representatives

40:10.116 --> 40:13.953
to whom they donated
large quantities of money.

40:14.036 --> 40:20.709
There is a very deep
and very clear symbiosis...

40:20.793 --> 40:24.422
between economic power and
political power in Brazil.

40:40.062 --> 40:44.233
Brazil is grand. The people are decent.

40:44.316 --> 40:47.278
But the politicians are very corrupt.

40:58.998 --> 41:03.586
R$8 BILLION IN FINANCING
TO JBS IS UNDER INVESTIGATION

41:03.669 --> 41:06.714
The family always denies
any political influence,

41:06.797 --> 41:08.257
but there is a lot of mistrust.

41:08.340 --> 41:13.179
And these investigations are ongoing.
We are waiting to see where this goes.

41:53.844 --> 41:57.973
Hello. How are you, President?

42:01.352 --> 42:03.020
I'm on good terms with Eduardo.

42:03.604 --> 42:06.607
You have to keep that up, OK?

42:06.982 --> 42:08.859
Every month, yes.

42:29.463 --> 42:33.384
They had a checking account for bribes.

43:03.998 --> 43:09.044
JBS ANNOUNCES PLAN TO SELL ASSETS
TO RAISE R$6 BILLION
