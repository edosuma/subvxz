_

00:11.938 --> 00:14.914
Bob! Bobby! Bob! Bob!

00:14.953 --> 00:16.334
What? What's happening? What?

00:16.359 --> 00:18.319
- I got it.
- You got what? Wait. What time is it?

00:18.320 --> 00:20.353
I just had a dream that we threw

00:20.388 --> 00:23.460
the most incredible
Christmas party ever thrown.

00:23.492 --> 00:24.891
It was perfect.

00:24.927 --> 00:26.460
And now I know what we have to do.

00:26.495 --> 00:27.961
Go back to sleep?

00:27.997 --> 00:29.730
No, no. Listen, listen.

00:29.765 --> 00:31.798
It just hasn't felt
like Christmas this year.

00:31.834 --> 00:34.434
I mean, I've got the spirit,
but people seem so sad.

00:34.470 --> 00:36.069
Look, I know money's tight.

00:36.105 --> 00:38.605
I know it's been a tough
year and that guy died,

00:38.640 --> 00:40.107
the guy that was in that show.

00:40.142 --> 00:41.308
Yeah, that was sad.

00:41.343 --> 00:42.976
But it's the holidays.

00:43.012 --> 00:44.863
Mm, okay. Good night.

00:44.888 --> 00:47.114
I think my dream was
trying to tell me something.

00:47.149 --> 00:50.277
I think we're supposed to
spread cheer and save Christmas.

00:50.302 --> 00:53.954
So, we should throw the party
from my dream at the restaurant.

00:53.989 --> 00:56.668
- Um, when?
- Today. This afternoon.

00:56.693 --> 00:57.957
The sooner the better.

00:57.982 --> 00:59.860
Okay, but let's not go crazy.

00:59.895 --> 01:01.373
We still have to wrap all our presents

01:01.397 --> 01:03.830
- and shop for a couple more.
- No, no.

01:03.866 --> 01:06.967

02:06.862 --> 02:08.728
Are those new underwear? Those are nice.

02:08.764 --> 02:11.815
Mm, no, they're old,
but thanks for noticing.

02:13.235 --> 02:14.679
So, a dream told Mom
that we should throw

02:14.703 --> 02:16.369
a Christmas party at the restaurant?

02:16.405 --> 02:18.875
That's right. We're gonna
spread a little Christmas cheer.

02:18.900 --> 02:20.440
I had a dream Dad had a ponytail.

02:20.476 --> 02:22.209
Should we just do that instead?

02:22.244 --> 02:23.510
Hang on, hang on. Shush.

02:23.545 --> 02:25.112
I'm standing outside The Wiggle Room

02:25.147 --> 02:26.613
where earlier this morning,

02:26.648 --> 02:28.882
club patrons went from
tearing the roof off

02:28.917 --> 02:31.351
this popular gay nightclub
to watching the city

02:31.386 --> 02:34.588
tear the actual roof off
this popular gay nightclub.

02:34.623 --> 02:35.922
This club has been in violation

02:35.958 --> 02:38.058
of multiple city codes for a long time.

02:38.093 --> 02:40.560
Noise violations, un-permitted stages

02:40.596 --> 02:42.362
and more than one illegal seesaw.

02:42.397 --> 02:43.397
Damn the man.

02:43.432 --> 02:44.764
Bros before city codes.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.766
So it looks like these tiny dancers

02:46.802 --> 02:49.236
will hold each other
closer this holiday season,

02:49.271 --> 02:51.905
making this cheery time of
year a little more tear-y

02:51.940 --> 02:53.106
for this community.

02:53.142 --> 02:56.443
Hmm.

02:58.413 --> 03:00.240
- Mother seems well.
- Lin, why are you

03:00.273 --> 03:01.581
cutting off the top of the tree?

03:01.617 --> 03:04.284
I'm just gonna borrow a
little bit from our tree

03:04.319 --> 03:05.919
and make a mini one for the restaurant.

03:05.954 --> 03:07.721
She's circumcising our tree.

03:07.756 --> 03:09.256
Did you see that news story?

03:09.291 --> 03:10.657
This Christmas is gonna be sad

03:10.692 --> 03:12.092
if we don't put in the extra effort.

03:13.943 --> 03:17.564
Okay, so, our tree looks
exactly how it looks right now

03:17.599 --> 03:19.599
'cause of what you just did.

03:19.635 --> 03:21.001
Oh, you could barely tell.

03:21.036 --> 03:22.335
Plus, I'll just reattach it.

03:22.371 --> 03:23.737
It'll grow back together and done.

03:23.772 --> 03:24.938
Yeah, that sounds right.

03:24.973 --> 03:26.640
This little guy has to be special,

03:26.675 --> 03:29.776
so I'm gonna relocate some
of my favorite ornaments.

03:29.811 --> 03:32.312
Aw, I remember when
Gene made me this one.

03:32.347 --> 03:33.847
Oh, my God, I love it.

03:33.882 --> 03:35.649
And Tina made me this one.

03:35.684 --> 03:37.250
Oh, my God, I love it.

03:37.286 --> 03:39.352
And Louise made me this one.

03:39.388 --> 03:40.687
Oh, my God, I love it!

03:40.722 --> 03:42.989
Frankly, you know, I'm
a little more interested

03:43.025 --> 03:46.092
in what's going under the
tree if you catch my drift.

03:46.128 --> 03:49.162
Yes, Louise, we got the link
to your online gift registry.

03:49.198 --> 03:51.097
I noticed a lot of the big-ticket items

03:51.133 --> 03:52.933
were still available, so...

03:52.968 --> 03:55.043
Aw, look at our little tree.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.746
I love my mini tree.

03:56.771 --> 03:58.438
I'm gonna fill it up with more ornaments

03:58.473 --> 04:00.506
and then I'm gonna go
invite everyone to the party.

04:08.683 --> 04:10.450
Yup. -I'm just gonna
start grabbing these

04:10.485 --> 04:12.496
and you let me know when I've
taken an appropriate amount.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.162

- So, just, so, just four then?

04:15.187 --> 04:16.422
Every time you come by?

04:16.458 --> 04:18.069

lot of each other, Bobby.

04:19.160 --> 04:20.593
Would you like a Santa Slider, Mort?

04:20.628 --> 04:22.829
Ooh, the last one.

04:22.864 --> 04:24.630
Room temperature and
everybody's touched it.

04:24.666 --> 04:26.877
No, no, no. It's pretty fresh
and-and no one's touched it,

04:26.901 --> 04:28.768
- except maybe Teddy.
- I grazed it.

04:28.803 --> 04:30.636
I'll wait for a fresh batch.

04:30.672 --> 04:32.450
- What's your problem, Mort?
- Just take it.

04:32.474 --> 04:33.706
Fine, I'll take it.

Ow! Ow! Ow!

04:35.143 --> 04:36.476
Just kidding. It's ice cold.

04:36.511 --> 04:38.111
Did you see my little tree?

04:38.146 --> 04:39.846
I put all my favorite ornaments on it.

04:39.881 --> 04:42.715
And the tree topper is a
little porcelain baby angel

04:42.751 --> 04:45.318
and he's smiling 'cause
he's on top of the tree.

04:45.353 --> 04:46.853
Can we just have the eggnog?

Have you been good? I hope
the Bleaken doesn't come.

04:56.097 --> 04:58.364
Who and/or what is the Bleaken?

04:58.400 --> 04:59.899
You kids don't know about the Bleaken?

04:59.934 --> 05:01.801
Is it a band? Are they on SoundCloud?

05:01.836 --> 05:04.237
He's got, like, different
names in different cultures,

05:04.272 --> 05:06.205
but he's basically the anti-Santa.

05:06.241 --> 05:07.907
You got our attention. Go on.

05:07.942 --> 05:09.675
The Bleaken is a horned creature

05:09.711 --> 05:12.211
with lizard skin and black feathers

05:12.247 --> 05:14.313
who comes every once in a while.

05:14.349 --> 05:16.749
- Every once in a while?
- Like El Niño?

05:16.785 --> 05:19.852
My Nana used to say he
feeds off sadness and anger.

05:19.888 --> 05:21.888
She said when me and
my sister would fight,

05:21.923 --> 05:23.423
it meant the Bleaken would come.

05:23.458 --> 05:24.724
Nana sounds fun.

05:24.759 --> 05:26.359
Is Nana short for banana?

05:26.394 --> 05:28.561
Well, what happens
when the Bleaken comes?

05:28.596 --> 05:29.874
The Bleaken steals your presents.

05:29.898 --> 05:31.164
- What?!
- Yup.

05:31.199 --> 05:32.510
Then he takes them back to his lair

05:32.534 --> 05:34.033
and you never see them again.

05:34.068 --> 05:36.669
And one time, I thought,
I thought I saw him.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.237
Wait, you saw the Bleaken?

05:38.273 --> 05:39.772
I don't know. I was little.

05:39.808 --> 05:41.340
Nana used to give us wine.

05:41.376 --> 05:42.742
You're freaking us out.

05:42.777 --> 05:44.377
Keep your weird Nana stuff to yourself.

05:44.412 --> 05:47.113
Yeah, the Bleaken's
probably just an old story.

05:47.148 --> 05:50.116
And a long story. Am I right? Eh?

05:50.151 --> 05:51.717
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

05:51.753 --> 05:54.253
Now it's a party.

05:54.289 --> 05:56.689
Yeah, 'cause Jimmy's here and me.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.858
And damn it, Trev, do not say stuff.

05:58.893 --> 06:01.314
What do you mean don't say stuff?
What-what am I supposed to say?

06:01.339 --> 06:02.525
- Just shush-ish.
- Uh, but...

06:02.550 --> 06:04.297
Hi, Jimmy. Hi, Trev.

It's a Christmas ceasefire,
Bob, a truce for the holidays.

06:09.671 --> 06:12.405
Yeah, Bob. Try to be the
bigger man for once, huh?

06:12.440 --> 06:14.607

hard because of your butt!

06:14.642 --> 06:16.042
It's big.

- Zoom.
- Hmm. Mm-hmm.

then ask his new boyfriend

boyfriend's ex-boyfriend.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.160
My ornaments.

08:14.195 --> 08:15.695
All my favorite ornaments.

08:15.730 --> 08:17.763
Wait, where is it?

08:17.799 --> 08:19.765
Kids, did you move Mom's little tree?

08:19.801 --> 08:20.744
- I didn't.
- Nope.

08:20.768 --> 08:21.602
- No.
- Oh, my God.

08:21.603 --> 08:25.065
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

08:26.487 --> 08:28.696
Who would steal a Christmas tree

08:28.721 --> 08:31.407
It's Christmas. Oh, right.
That kind of makes sense.

08:31.432 --> 08:33.813
My favorite ornaments. My little babies.

08:33.839 --> 08:35.049
- I know, it's...
- I'm gonna faint.

08:35.073 --> 08:36.688
I know it's awful, Lin,

08:36.714 --> 08:38.073
but-but try and calm down.

08:38.089 --> 08:39.855
I mean, you already called the police.

08:39.890 --> 08:41.289
- Three times.
- I say call back

08:41.325 --> 08:43.392
and this time, you hang up on them.

08:43.427 --> 08:45.561
I say call that new Vietnamese place

08:45.596 --> 08:48.030
and order just a ton of beef bánh mis.

08:48.065 --> 08:51.467
I came as quickly as I could
after I did some other stuff.

08:51.502 --> 08:54.175
- So what was stolen?
- My little Christmas tree.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.949
Technically, it was just the
top of the Christmas tree.

08:55.973 --> 08:57.239
- Just the tip.
- Gene.

08:57.274 --> 08:59.408
It had all my favorite ornaments on it.

08:59.443 --> 09:01.810
- My kids made most of them.
- I have one question.

09:01.846 --> 09:03.445
Did the thief steal your kids' hands?

09:03.481 --> 09:04.880
- No.
- Good.

09:04.915 --> 09:06.326
Kids, make your mom some new ornaments

09:06.350 --> 09:07.716
and quit wasting my time.

09:07.752 --> 09:09.218
Sergeant Bosco, please.

09:09.253 --> 09:10.386
Let me tell you something.

09:10.421 --> 09:12.087
I've learned one thing
in law enforcement.

09:12.123 --> 09:15.090
People are awful and
Christmas makes them worse.

09:15.126 --> 09:17.826
There's been a rash of little
thefts like this all over town.

09:17.862 --> 09:18.961
What's been stolen?

09:18.996 --> 09:20.095
A lot of Christmas crap.

09:20.131 --> 09:21.497
Lights, plastic reindeer,

09:21.532 --> 09:23.666
a bunch of those
inflatable Santa Clauses.

09:23.701 --> 09:25.634
- I have one of those.
- Of course you do.

09:25.670 --> 09:27.269
Well, I wouldn't put it out this year.

09:27.304 --> 09:28.637
Wait, I already did.

09:28.673 --> 09:30.606
Do you have any leads? Any suspects?

09:30.641 --> 09:32.441
Yeah, some guy... or girl,

09:32.476 --> 09:33.842
or a group of guys and girls.

09:33.878 --> 09:35.344
Bye, I'm leaving.

09:35.379 --> 09:37.112
I'm sorry, Lin.

09:37.148 --> 09:38.280
He-he wasn't really helpful.

09:38.315 --> 09:39.948
But maybe let's do like he said

09:39.984 --> 09:41.595
and have the kids make
some new ornaments.

09:41.619 --> 09:43.318
I don't want new ornaments, Bob.

09:43.354 --> 09:45.954
I want the ornaments from
when they were young and cute,

09:45.990 --> 09:47.456
not from now.

09:47.491 --> 09:48.791
Hey, I'm adorable.

09:48.826 --> 09:50.459
You know what? We don't need Bosco.

09:50.494 --> 09:52.494
Whoever took my tree
was a guest at our party.

09:52.530 --> 09:54.096
We know who all the suspects are.

09:54.131 --> 09:55.497
We just have to go talk to them.

09:55.533 --> 09:56.832
Lin, Christmas is in three days.

09:56.867 --> 09:57.944
Are-are you sure this is...

09:57.968 --> 09:59.468
I'm finding my ornaments, Bob!

09:59.503 --> 10:01.470
Oh, whoa. Fine.

10:01.505 --> 10:04.306
But we can't get too
carried away, right?

10:04.341 --> 10:06.556
Or we let Mom solve every crime in town.

10:06.581 --> 10:10.212
Like Kyra Sedgwick or
Mariska Hargitay-tag-gahh.

10:12.149 --> 10:14.783
Okay, here it is. This is
everyone who was at our party.

10:14.810 --> 10:17.610
I already crossed you, the kids,
Teddy and Mort off the list.

10:17.655 --> 10:19.388
Hmm, I don't know. Mort
was a little annoyed

10:19.423 --> 10:21.390
that he had to take the
last slider on the tray.

10:21.425 --> 10:22.825
Ooh, motive.

10:22.860 --> 10:24.560
Okay, Mort's back on the list.

10:24.595 --> 10:26.835
But maybe we should start
with the more obvious suspects.

10:26.864 --> 10:29.540
I think I might know one.

10:29.565 --> 10:30.866
Jimmy Pesto.

10:30.901 --> 10:32.301
Come on, let's go grill him!

10:32.336 --> 10:33.747
Wait, Lin, I'll go with you,

10:33.771 --> 10:35.571
but let's try not to
let this get out of hand.

10:35.606 --> 10:37.206
Oh, I won't go overboard.

10:37.241 --> 10:39.041
Now let's go toss that pizza man.

10:39.076 --> 10:41.076
- I'm going to get my coat.
- What should we do?

10:41.112 --> 10:42.512
We should probably go with you guys.

10:42.546 --> 10:43.979
You could use the extra muscle.

10:44.014 --> 10:46.048
No, no, no, we'll close
for a little while.

10:46.083 --> 10:48.550
You kids go upstairs
and make your mom and me

10:48.586 --> 10:51.687
- some of those coupon books that...
- You love so much?

10:51.722 --> 10:54.256
No, I was gonna say that
you never seem to honor.

10:54.291 --> 10:55.691
Well, you wanted us to honor them?

10:55.726 --> 10:57.760
I guess it's not the
thought that counts.

10:57.795 --> 10:59.862
Bob, come on!

10:59.897 --> 11:02.164
Heh-ho! Look what the fart dragged in!

11:02.199 --> 11:04.099
Can it, Pesto.

11:04.135 --> 11:05.834
I know you did it.
Where are you hiding it?

11:05.870 --> 11:07.169
What are you yelling about?

11:07.204 --> 11:09.071
We're in-investigating a crime.

11:09.106 --> 11:11.206
She's following up on a... lead.

11:11.242 --> 11:14.510
Oh, no. Did someone steal
all of your customers?

11:14.545 --> 11:16.779
Wait. That was me!

11:16.814 --> 11:19.915
He's talking about your livelihood.

11:19.950 --> 11:22.785
No, Jimmy. Somebody stole
my little Christmas tree

11:22.820 --> 11:24.286
from the holiday party, and I think

11:24.321 --> 11:26.755
you know exactly who stole
it because it was you!

11:26.791 --> 11:29.091
What? Well, why would
I want your dumb tree?

11:29.126 --> 11:30.759
I thought maybe, uh, you came over here

11:30.795 --> 11:33.362
- because you found the fudge.
- Fudge? What fudge?

11:33.397 --> 11:35.063
I took some fudge from the snack table

11:35.099 --> 11:37.132
at your party and put it in the urinal.

11:37.168 --> 11:38.767
So it looked like someone pooped!

11:40.437 --> 11:42.638
So, there was really no
reason to stay after that,

11:42.673 --> 11:44.139
and we left. Doodly doo.

11:44.175 --> 11:46.441
Huh. You did leave kind of early.

11:46.477 --> 11:48.310
The tree wasn't stolen till later.

11:48.345 --> 11:50.979
Well, Lin, I think it's
obvious that Jimmy is an idiot.

11:51.015 --> 11:52.881
- Yeah?
- But I don't think he did it.

11:52.917 --> 11:55.984
Um, I don't think an idiot
would put fudge in a urinal.

11:56.020 --> 11:58.420
Yeah, maybe we can
cross him off the list.

11:58.455 --> 12:00.222
Wait. Security cameras.

12:00.257 --> 12:02.624
Jimmy's camera doesn't
point at our restaurant.

12:02.660 --> 12:04.593
Yeah, why would I want to do that? What?

12:04.628 --> 12:06.807
Is America's Most Boring and
Sad Videos still on the air?

12:08.299 --> 12:09.798
That was never a show!

12:09.834 --> 12:11.633
I'm not talking about Jimmy's camera.

12:11.669 --> 12:14.102
Mort's got a camera on
our side of the street.

12:14.138 --> 12:15.804
"Present this coupon

12:15.840 --> 12:18.941
to redeem a 200-minute
foot massage from Tina."

12:18.976 --> 12:21.844
- What? - Guys, I know
you're working really hard.

12:21.879 --> 12:24.847
We all are. But I think
I know who took Mom's tree

12:24.882 --> 12:27.596
and all the Christmas
stuff Bosco said was stolen.

12:27.621 --> 12:30.519
My theory? The Bleaken did it.

12:30.554 --> 12:32.955
Whoa. Teddy did say the
Bleaken steals stuff.

12:32.990 --> 12:34.967
Well, he's not gonna steal our presents.

12:34.992 --> 12:36.658
Why not? Is it 'cause we're poor

12:36.694 --> 12:38.534
and our toys break almost immediately?

12:38.559 --> 12:40.996
No. 'Cause we are gonna stop him.

13:01.151 --> 13:02.896
- before he steals our
Christmas presents. - Totally.

13:02.920 --> 13:04.664
I just think maybe once
we find him and scare him,

13:04.688 --> 13:07.456

13:42.726 --> 13:44.493
We really appreciate
it. And you should know

13:44.528 --> 13:46.495
- we never thought you
were a suspect. - Thanks.

13:46.530 --> 13:48.897
Sounds like maybe you did,
but let me just push past that

13:48.933 --> 13:50.532
and bring up the video from yesterday.

13:50.567 --> 13:53.035
All right, let me jump to
the middle of the party,

13:53.070 --> 13:54.847
- and...
- Fischoeder.

13:54.872 --> 13:58.106
Wait. I don't remember
seeing Fischoeder at our party.

13:58.131 --> 14:00.252
And now we know why.

14:00.277 --> 14:03.445
He looked inside, saw
us, and... didn't come in.

14:03.480 --> 14:06.748
That Ba-hum-bugger. Look, it's
you, Mort. Are you skipping?

14:06.784 --> 14:08.784
I was, uh... I was 
just trying something.

14:08.819 --> 14:10.218
I'm just gonna fast-forward.

14:10.254 --> 14:11.908
Wait, wait! Stop! Go back. Go back.

14:11.955 --> 14:15.123
- Right there. Look!
- Oh, my God. Edith.

14:15.159 --> 14:17.092
She's hiding something under her coat.

14:17.127 --> 14:20.385
We got ya! Greatest generation, my ass!

14:21.667 --> 14:24.102
Hey Lin, what's the plan?
How do we get 'em to talk?

14:24.127 --> 14:26.533
Here's the plan. We go in,
and we get my tree back.

14:26.565 --> 14:28.699
Oh, good. So you've
thought this through.

14:28.734 --> 14:31.468
- Edith! Harold!
- Hello?

14:31.667 --> 14:33.934
Well, nobody's in here.
Maybe we should go?

14:33.969 --> 14:35.602
Door to the back. Let's go.

14:35.637 --> 14:37.537
Yup. Great. Let's do that.

14:37.573 --> 14:39.806
Oh, my God.

14:40.002 --> 14:41.808
Class is full. Go away!

14:41.844 --> 14:44.411
Hi, everyone. Sorry. Keep drawing.

14:44.446 --> 14:47.581
What do you want? -We want
you to explain... this!

14:47.616 --> 14:49.082
That picture doesn't prove anything!

14:49.118 --> 14:51.084
- That could be any old lady.
- Hey!

14:51.120 --> 14:53.120
I mean, no, you look good.
I mean, uh... nothing.

14:53.155 --> 14:54.754
- I know I do.
- Yes, you do!

14:54.790 --> 14:57.057
Can you two please just
give my wife her tree?

14:57.092 --> 14:59.926
- Tree? What tree?
- We didn't take your damn tree!

14:59.962 --> 15:01.294
Oh, you didn't, huh?

15:01.330 --> 15:02.807
What's under your
coat, Miss Grabby Puss?

15:02.831 --> 15:05.999
Well, we took your cookie platter, okay?
Happy now?

15:06.034 --> 15:08.068
- You took our what?
- Cookies!

15:08.103 --> 15:10.003
We've had life-drawing
classes all week.

15:10.038 --> 15:12.839
We-we came to your party, and
we ran out of time to buy snacks.

15:12.875 --> 15:16.257
Nudes need snacks! It's
hard work! They like cookies!

15:16.282 --> 15:18.011
It was the end of the party.

15:18.046 --> 15:20.007
We thought you were
gonna throw them out!

15:20.032 --> 15:22.449
No one was supposed to get hurt!

15:22.484 --> 15:24.366
Huh. Bob, look at naked Santa.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.486
I-I saw him, Lin. You
really can't miss him.

15:26.522 --> 15:29.189
No, look at him again. I
think he was at our party.

15:29.224 --> 15:30.957
He's Art, the artist, remember?

15:30.993 --> 15:32.526
Oh, yeah. Um, can we leave?

15:32.561 --> 15:35.162
No. He's a suspect. We
have to question him.

15:35.197 --> 15:38.798
Well, you two should be ashamed of
yourselves. Stealing our cookies.

15:38.837 --> 15:41.201

No! I got to keep looking, Bobby!

16:44.458 --> 16:47.092
I need to find my
ornaments. My little babies!

16:47.127 --> 16:50.262

I crossed everyone off the list.

17:19.492 --> 17:22.327
My ornaments are just out
there in the cold dyin'.

17:22.362 --> 17:23.928
- I'm sorry, Lin.
- You know what?

17:23.964 --> 17:25.396
I'm gonna go back out there

17:25.432 --> 17:26.998
and talk to everyone on my list again.

17:27.034 --> 17:28.108
Maybe I missed something.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.934
Lin, we still need to wrap presents.

17:29.970 --> 17:31.336
What? What are you talkin' about?

17:31.371 --> 17:33.438
Presents... we need to wrap them

17:33.473 --> 17:36.174
for the kids... for Christmas, remember?

17:36.209 --> 17:38.953
Right. The kids' presents.
We haven't wrapped 'em.

17:38.978 --> 17:40.779
- We have not.
- That's bad.

17:40.814 --> 17:42.825
It's fine. I'm just wondering
when we're gonna do it.

17:42.849 --> 17:46.084
And by "we," I mean mostly
you, 'cause I'm horrible at it.

17:46.119 --> 17:49.087
Yeah, you wrap like a drunk, blind bear.

17:49.122 --> 17:50.455
That's how I live.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.590
Eh, I may have been a little...

17:52.626 --> 17:55.219
overly focused on getting my tree back.

17:55.244 --> 17:57.495
Well, you know what?
I'm done. -Wait. Really?

17:57.531 --> 17:59.309
Yeah. That thief may
have stolen my ornaments,

17:59.333 --> 18:01.344
but he's not gonna steal our Christmas.

18:01.368 --> 18:03.304
Mom, we need to talk to you.
It's about your tree.

18:03.329 --> 18:06.186
Da-da-da. Kid-Kids, your mother's
actually done looking for the tree,

18:06.211 --> 18:10.041
- and we are all very happy about that.
- Yup, yup. All done.

18:10.077 --> 18:11.276
We know who stole it!

18:11.311 --> 18:13.144
You do?! Who was it?!

18:13.180 --> 18:15.347
- Oh, my God.
- It was the Bleaken!

18:15.382 --> 18:18.350
- What? - You-you kids believe
in the Bleaken? - Yeah!

18:18.385 --> 18:21.319
- So you know about him?
- Yeah, but, I mean, he's not real.

18:21.355 --> 18:22.787
You got to believe us.

18:22.823 --> 18:25.357
This crime has Bleaken
written all over it.

18:25.392 --> 18:27.826
Thanks, kids. It's sweet
that you're trying to help,

18:27.861 --> 18:29.828
but there's no such
thing as the Bleaken.

18:29.863 --> 18:32.630
Plus, I'm fine. Don't worry
about your mom. I'm fine.

18:32.666 --> 18:34.466
Well, we are worried about you, Mother,

18:34.501 --> 18:37.001
but we're also worried about
our presents getting stolen.

18:37.037 --> 18:39.137
Look, everyone, tomorrow
is Christmas, and I think

18:39.172 --> 18:43.041
we should all just act as
normal as we... normally do.

18:43.076 --> 18:44.976
And enjoy it as much as we can

18:45.011 --> 18:46.911
with whatever presents Santa brings

18:46.947 --> 18:50.548
and whatever presents we
bought, which are... gre-great.

18:50.584 --> 18:53.251
And not exactly what
you asked for, but close.

18:53.286 --> 18:57.155
- Kind of. You're-you're...
you're gonna love it. - Yay!

18:57.190 --> 18:59.268
All right, Mom and Dad wouldn't
believe us about the Bleaken,

18:59.292 --> 19:00.992
but maybe the cops will.

19:01.027 --> 19:03.661
A ragtag gang like us
comin' in off the streets.

19:03.697 --> 19:05.263
Of course they'll believe us.

19:05.298 --> 19:09.267
The... Bleaken... is... not... real.

19:09.302 --> 19:11.503
No, you got to listen.
Call the SWAT team!

19:11.538 --> 19:13.238
Call MASH! Call Columbo!

19:13.273 --> 19:15.907
Call everybody. He is
gonna ruin Christmas!

19:15.942 --> 19:18.076
Stop... talking!

19:18.111 --> 19:19.878
Listen, it's just a bunch of punk kids

19:19.913 --> 19:21.613
stealing Christmas crap around town.

19:21.648 --> 19:24.099
Wait. Is that a map of all
the places that got robbed?

19:24.124 --> 19:25.923
Yeah, the ones I
bothered putting up there.

19:25.948 --> 19:28.081
Also, I ran out of thumb
tacks, so I just stopped.

19:28.106 --> 19:30.646
Hmm. What about that? Is
that some kind of lamp?

19:30.671 --> 19:33.425
What? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I
guess I kind of like lamps.

19:33.460 --> 19:34.818
- You think I have too many
in here or what?

19:34.843 --> 19:37.395
- No. No.
- No. The appropriate amount of lamps.

19:37.431 --> 19:39.464
Well, we're really
sorry we bothered you.

19:39.499 --> 19:42.434
Seems like you're on top of
everything, Sergeant Bosco.

19:42.469 --> 19:45.036
It's punk kids doing it. Ugh. Punks.

19:45.071 --> 19:47.972
- And thank you for the water.
- You're welcome.

19:48.545 --> 19:51.381
What happened, Louise?
You got out of there really fast.

19:51.406 --> 19:53.600
Did you have to toot?
'Cause I just went for it.

19:53.625 --> 19:55.021
They can't arrest you for that.

19:55.046 --> 19:57.404
Yeah, I don't know. Maybe
it's 'cause I took this!

19:57.452 --> 19:59.252
A picture of the side of Bosco's face?

19:59.287 --> 20:02.054
- Not his best angle.
- But great lighting. Lamp lighting.

20:02.090 --> 20:03.923
No, it's a picture of the map.

20:03.958 --> 20:06.526
Now that we know where the
Bleaken stole everything from,

20:06.561 --> 20:09.195
maybe we can triangulate,
and find his nest.

20:09.230 --> 20:10.730
I'll try-angulate anything once.

20:10.765 --> 20:12.698
There's a pattern. I know there is.

20:12.734 --> 20:14.534
Is it plaid? It's probably plaid.

20:14.569 --> 20:17.036
Wait. Isn't this spot
right in the middle? Like,

20:17.071 --> 20:18.571
the exact middle of all of them?

20:18.606 --> 20:20.241
I guess so. What does that mean?

20:20.266 --> 20:22.608
It means it's got to
be the Bleaken's lair.

20:22.644 --> 20:25.278
I say tonight, after
Christmas Eve dinner,

20:25.313 --> 20:28.915
we sneak out, find his
nest, save our presents,

20:28.950 --> 20:31.205
and if we have time,
we get Mom's tree back.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.697
Oh, my God, did we just triangulate?

20:33.722 --> 20:36.056
Gene, play it cool, but, yeah, we did.

20:40.398 --> 20:41.663
You kids are quiet.

20:41.718 --> 20:43.515
Do you, do you, do you like your ham?

20:43.562 --> 20:45.412
It's very good ham, Father.

20:45.437 --> 20:47.070
This ham is making me sleepy.

20:47.105 --> 20:49.843
I'll definitely be sleeping
in my bed all night now.

20:49.868 --> 20:52.429
Okay. Uh, good.

20:52.454 --> 20:55.878
All right, bastard, or
group of bastards, out there

20:55.914 --> 20:57.155
stealing decorations.

20:57.211 --> 20:58.611
You think you're gonna get my Santa?

20:58.646 --> 21:00.045
You're not gonna get my Santa.

21:00.081 --> 21:01.814
You're gonna get a big surprise.

21:01.849 --> 21:04.283
That's what you're gonna
get. Yeah. Big surprise.

21:04.318 --> 21:07.317
So... should we put out
cookies and milk for Santa?

21:07.342 --> 21:09.004

thieves. Come and get me.

21:53.559 --> 21:57.361
No one would suspect a man would
spend his Christmas Eve in here.

21:59.240 --> 22:00.506
Tina, how we doing?

22:00.541 --> 22:02.207
We almost there? We in the right spot?

22:02.243 --> 22:04.009
Yeah, we just have to walk towards

22:04.111 --> 22:06.323
that abandoned warehouse down
this dark, abandoned street.

22:06.347 --> 22:07.964
Everything's fine. Unless
you think it's not,

22:07.989 --> 22:09.145
and we should call Mom and Dad.

22:09.170 --> 22:11.317
No. We've gone rogue.

22:11.352 --> 22:13.018
We're not calling Mom and Dad.

22:13.054 --> 22:15.754
Nobody panic, but I'm running
out of walking cookies.

22:15.790 --> 22:17.950
Come on, guys, we're doing this for Mom,

22:17.975 --> 22:20.836
and Christmas, AKA our presents.

22:20.861 --> 22:23.062
Eh, we really shouldn't have snuck out

22:23.097 --> 22:24.597
I'm feeling sneaker-outer's remorse.

22:24.632 --> 22:26.610
Tina, Mom and Dad wouldn't
want us wandering around

22:26.634 --> 22:28.801
this part of town alone,
so we had to sneak out

22:28.836 --> 22:30.703
because we love them so much.

22:35.084 --> 22:37.119
- Uh, hello?
- I don't know,

22:37.144 --> 22:39.111
I think Mom and Dad would like to know

22:39.146 --> 22:41.137
that we're down near the
strange, abandoned building

22:41.162 --> 22:45.464
on the corner of Garfield Street
and Jackson Street, I think.

22:45.499 --> 22:49.333
- I can't read it very well.
- Tina? Tina, sweetie, can you hear me?

22:49.358 --> 22:51.537
Bob, I think the kids
snuck out of the house.

22:51.572 --> 22:53.205
Wait, what? Tina's butt-dialing me

22:53.241 --> 22:54.908
from the emergency
phone... I can hear 'em.

22:54.933 --> 22:57.910
Tina! Tina, it's Mommy. Can you hear me?

22:57.945 --> 22:59.223
- Tina!
- Louise, I really think

22:59.247 --> 23:00.880
we should turn around and go home.

23:00.915 --> 23:02.759
There's nothing out here
except a thousand scary alleys.

23:02.783 --> 23:06.218
Guys. Oh, my gosh, it's
one of Mom's ornaments.

23:06.254 --> 23:07.987
That's the one I made.

23:08.022 --> 23:10.155
You're safe now. Shh,
shh, it's all over.

23:10.191 --> 23:12.424
It's okay. Get this ornament a blanket!

23:13.561 --> 23:14.727
What?

23:14.762 --> 23:16.428
- Ah!
- Hell no!

23:16.464 --> 23:17.863
This is real. This is happening.

23:17.899 --> 23:20.246
So, should we, like, stake out the
perimeter and call for some backup?

23:20.271 --> 23:22.735
No, there's no time. It's
Christmas frickin' Eve.

23:22.770 --> 23:25.105
Look, footprints. Let's follow them.

23:25.130 --> 23:27.406
Crap. Flashlight's dead.

23:27.441 --> 23:29.395
Looks like we'll be
doing this in the dark.

23:29.420 --> 23:31.316

Okay, all signs point 
to the Bleaken's lair

23:52.972 --> 23:54.611
being inside this warehouse.

23:54.636 --> 23:56.069
We just need to figure out

23:56.104 --> 23:57.682
how to get in and get
Mom's ornaments out.

23:57.823 --> 24:00.557
But we've looked all over this
place and there's no doors.

24:00.592 --> 24:03.907
Maybe we could go home and
make some muffins and come back.

24:03.932 --> 24:05.328
Everyone likes to open the door

24:05.364 --> 24:07.030
to a fresh basket of muffins.

24:07.065 --> 24:09.366
That's weird... there's
footprints that lead that way,

24:09.401 --> 24:10.700
but there's nothing over there.

24:10.736 --> 24:11.968
It doesn't make any sense.

24:12.003 --> 24:13.803
There's nothing here but a ditch.

24:13.839 --> 24:15.372
A nasty little ditch.

24:15.407 --> 24:17.018
Are you kidding me? We came all this way

24:17.042 --> 24:18.208
and we can't get in?

24:18.243 --> 24:20.977
Ugh! Hmm? What the...

24:21.012 --> 24:23.646
- Huh?
- You guys, this is a wall.

24:23.682 --> 24:26.000
Wow, someone painted
a super realistic mural

24:26.025 --> 24:27.317
on the side of this warehouse.

24:27.352 --> 24:30.587
I thought only Wile E. Coyote
could do that. Or Banksy.

24:30.622 --> 24:32.222
You guys, I think I found the door.

24:32.257 --> 24:33.857
Oh, my God, it's unlocked.

24:35.260 --> 24:37.160
Looks like the only way to go is down.

24:39.097 --> 24:41.931
My nightmare called... it
wants its scary staircase back.

24:41.967 --> 24:44.167
Okay, before we do
this, let's talk weapons.

24:44.202 --> 24:46.102
- What'd everybody bring?
- Wait, what?

24:46.138 --> 24:48.004
None. Why are we talking weapons now?

24:48.039 --> 24:49.839
There was a much better time to do this,

24:49.875 --> 24:51.085
back when we were near weapons.

24:51.109 --> 24:53.443
Well, I have extras. You're welcome.

24:53.478 --> 24:55.712
Okay, here's what I got.

24:55.747 --> 24:58.214
Ruler, for slapping or poking.

24:58.250 --> 24:59.749
- Or measuring.
- Pass.

24:59.785 --> 25:02.051
- Key chain, for stabbing.
- Or keys.

25:02.087 --> 25:03.453
You could also take the key chain,

25:03.488 --> 25:04.954
and you could force it down a throat.

25:04.990 --> 25:06.856
Yeah, you could sneak
it into someone's mouth.

25:06.892 --> 25:07.370
Yeah.

25:07.395 --> 25:09.093
Hey, what's that? Oh,
keys in your mouth.

25:09.118 --> 25:11.294
- Wha-What else you got?
- Uh, you know, Mace, knife.

25:11.329 --> 25:13.129
- But I'm keeping those.
- Oh.

25:13.165 --> 25:16.433
Uh, I guess I'll go ruler, but
I don't feel good about this.

25:16.468 --> 25:18.067
Shall we?

25:22.687 --> 25:25.421
♪ ♪

25:26.045 --> 25:28.455
Okay...

25:28.480 --> 25:30.713
Weird. Why would there be stairs

25:30.749 --> 25:32.115
that lead to a brick wall?

25:32.150 --> 25:33.583
Maybe it's another painting?

25:33.618 --> 25:35.718
Like, maybe it's a
picture of a brick wall

25:35.754 --> 25:38.154
painted on a super easy to
walk through piece of paper.

25:38.190 --> 25:39.889
Ow. No, that feels like brick.

25:39.925 --> 25:41.269
All right, Tina said the corner

25:41.293 --> 25:42.725
of Garfield and Jackson,

25:42.761 --> 25:44.071
but those streets don't intersect.

25:44.095 --> 25:46.129
She's not good with directions, Bob.

25:46.164 --> 25:47.464
Nobody is in our family.

25:47.499 --> 25:48.965
We're lucky we ever get anywhere.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.234
We're so stupid. Oh, God, my babies!

25:51.269 --> 25:52.669
My babies are in danger, no!

25:52.704 --> 25:54.137
Lin, Lin, Lin.

25:54.172 --> 25:55.738
Lin, let's try and stay calm.

25:55.774 --> 25:57.907
This is a-a totally safe area

25:57.943 --> 25:59.587
for kids to walk around.

25:59.611 --> 26:01.744
See? Those dogs are playing...

26:01.780 --> 26:03.980
- to the death.
- It's all my fault.

26:04.015 --> 26:06.816
If I hadn't gotten so caught up
in my ornaments investigation,

26:06.852 --> 26:09.285
the kids wouldn't be
in danger right now.

26:09.321 --> 26:10.920
- That's true.
- Bob!

26:10.956 --> 26:12.333
You're not supposed to agree with me

26:12.357 --> 26:13.656
when I blame myself.

26:13.692 --> 26:14.791
Oh, right, it's, uh,

26:14.826 --> 26:16.159
then it's not your fault.

26:16.194 --> 26:18.428
Thank you. Now say it's all your fault.

26:18.463 --> 26:19.629
What? Why-why?

26:19.664 --> 26:20.630
- Say it.
- No.

26:20.665 --> 26:22.298
Okay, it's both our faults.

26:22.365 --> 26:23.564
Fine.

26:24.895 --> 26:26.481
Well, this is
Garfield and Johnson.

26:26.505 --> 26:28.304
Could she have maybe
not read it very well?

26:28.340 --> 26:29.617
Maybe. We haven't bought her new glasses

26:29.641 --> 26:30.840
since she was six.

26:30.876 --> 26:32.053
Well, there are footprints here,

26:32.077 --> 26:33.510
and they could be kid-sized,

26:33.545 --> 26:35.645
and there's a lot of cookie crumbs.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.146
Oh, God, no!

26:37.182 --> 26:41.818
My babies are in there. No. Why?

26:41.853 --> 26:44.721
Eh, so no decorations thief yet.

26:44.756 --> 26:47.323
That's okay. It's a waiting game, right?

26:47.359 --> 26:50.159
Here comes nice Mrs. Chang
with her little doggy.

26:50.195 --> 26:52.380
Hello, little doggy.

26:52.405 --> 26:54.297
Hey, she's not picking it up.

26:54.332 --> 26:56.132
So she's the one that doesn't scoop.

26:56.167 --> 26:58.735
I did not suspect that. All these years.

26:58.770 --> 27:00.670
Uh-oh, uh-oh, there's the smell.

27:03.408 --> 27:05.241
That's bad. Oh, that's bad.

27:05.277 --> 27:06.976
Oh, it's coming in the suit.

27:07.012 --> 27:10.213
Ugh, it's trapped in
here. No, no... ugh!

27:10.248 --> 27:12.248
Don't puke in Santa.
Don't puke in Santa.

27:12.988 --> 27:14.161
Ugh, we've pushed on every brick

27:14.185 --> 27:16.299
on these stupid walls and nothing works.

27:17.097 --> 27:18.666
Did you guys hear that?
I think someone's coming.

27:18.690 --> 27:19.867
Everybody be quiet.

27:19.891 --> 27:21.224
It's probably the Bleaken,

27:21.259 --> 27:22.825
or maybe one of his minions.

27:22.861 --> 27:24.727
Do you think they call
themselves "Blinions"?

27:24.763 --> 27:27.864
If they don't, they're
making a terrible mistake.

27:27.899 --> 27:30.700
You guys, I think I just realized

27:30.735 --> 27:33.665
why there's a staircase
leading to nowhere.

27:33.690 --> 27:35.672
- Why?
- To trap someone.

27:37.674 --> 27:40.009
Okay, here's the plan:
we hide behind here,

27:40.045 --> 27:41.411
and as soon as they come down,

27:41.446 --> 27:43.780
- we jump 'em.
- I love the hiding part.

27:43.815 --> 27:45.448
Everybody get out your weapons.

27:45.483 --> 27:46.716
Is it too late to switch?

27:46.751 --> 27:48.251
Great ruler here if anyone wants it.

27:48.286 --> 27:50.031
- Incredibly accurate.
- Shh, here they come.

27:50.055 --> 27:51.087
Get 'em!

27:53.258 --> 27:54.969
- Oh, my God.
- Hold on. Hold on, stop, stop.

27:54.993 --> 27:57.093
- Mom? Dad?
- Kids?

27:57.128 --> 27:58.962
Oh, my baby, baby, baby, babies.

27:58.997 --> 28:01.030
Oh, I'm so glad you're safe.

28:01.066 --> 28:03.199
Did-did someone just hit
me in the face with a ruler?

28:03.234 --> 28:04.934
- It was Gene.
- It-it hurt.

28:04.970 --> 28:06.469
Oh, did it? Cool.

28:06.504 --> 28:08.438
I mean, shame on you,
Gene. That's our father.

28:08.473 --> 28:10.206
What are you kids doing down here?

28:10.241 --> 28:11.641
Why'd you attack us?

28:11.676 --> 28:13.076
We thought you were Blinions.

28:13.111 --> 28:14.544
How did you know where to find us?

28:14.579 --> 28:16.045
You butt-dialed us.

28:16.081 --> 28:17.592
We could hear you
talking in the background.

28:17.616 --> 28:19.148
Huh, that's funny.

28:19.184 --> 28:20.984
I wonder who it could have been.

28:21.019 --> 28:22.952
Who's got the most scared butt?

28:22.988 --> 28:24.754
Mom's got the most fierce butt.

28:24.789 --> 28:25.822
Thank you, Gene.

28:25.857 --> 28:28.018
But Dad's is the most lived-in.

28:28.043 --> 28:29.058
Thank you, Gene.

28:29.094 --> 28:30.460
I did it, okay, Louise?

28:30.495 --> 28:32.239
I called Mom and Dad, and
told them where we were.

28:32.263 --> 28:34.268
- It was me.
- Uh, yeah, I figured.

28:34.293 --> 28:35.189
Oh.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.066
Well, whatever. We're all here.

28:37.102 --> 28:38.267
Maybe you guys can help us

28:38.303 --> 28:39.736
get past this brick wall.

28:39.771 --> 28:41.437
By the way, how long
did it take you guys

28:41.473 --> 28:43.306
to figure out the door was in the mural?

28:43.341 --> 28:45.141
Way too long. I still don't think

28:45.176 --> 28:47.810
- your mom gets it.
- I get it, kind of.

28:47.846 --> 28:49.178
It's a mirror, right?

28:49.214 --> 28:50.813
- No.
- It is.

28:50.849 --> 28:53.116
- -
- Oh, my God, what was that?

28:53.151 --> 28:54.817
You guys, look.

28:54.853 --> 28:56.319
That step is rattling,

28:56.354 --> 28:58.021
like it's hollow or something.

28:58.056 --> 29:00.156
Huh, that's odd.

29:00.191 --> 29:01.491
Dad, help me lift this up.

29:01.526 --> 29:03.259
Easy, Bob, easy... your back.

29:03.294 --> 29:05.695
- Lift with your legs, you're so frail.
- Oh, my God.

29:05.730 --> 29:07.196
Why are we doing this?

29:07.232 --> 29:10.700
Whoa, a secret staircase
inside a staircase.

29:10.735 --> 29:13.169
It's an architectural turducken.

29:13.204 --> 29:15.104
Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's great.

29:15.140 --> 29:16.939
- Uh, now let's go home.
- What?

29:16.975 --> 29:19.542
No way. We came this far.
We can't turn back now.

29:19.577 --> 29:21.811
We're so close to finding the Bleaken.

29:21.846 --> 29:23.346
Louise, the Bleaken isn't real,

29:23.381 --> 29:25.715
- and he didn't steal Mom's ornaments.
- Okay, fine.

29:25.750 --> 29:28.017
Then how do you explain this?

29:28.053 --> 29:29.619
One of my ornaments.

29:29.654 --> 29:31.788
- What the...
- Where did you kids find this?

29:31.823 --> 29:33.856
Here. That's what we're
trying to tell you.

29:33.892 --> 29:36.292
A map of the robberies
led us to this area,

29:36.327 --> 29:38.673
and then we followed a trail
of black feathers and footprints

29:38.697 --> 29:40.196
into this building.

29:40.231 --> 29:42.465
Obviously, something is going on.

29:42.500 --> 29:44.300
Where there's smoke, there's feathers.

29:44.335 --> 29:46.669
Listen, kids, I'm glad you
found one of the ornaments,

29:46.705 --> 29:48.797
and I am really glad you're okay,

29:48.822 --> 29:50.406
but there's no way we're
spending Christmas Eve

29:50.442 --> 29:52.475
in a dark, scary warehouse. Right, Lin?

29:52.510 --> 29:54.010
- Here's the thing, Bob.
- Oh, no.

29:54.045 --> 29:55.890
Now, I'm not saying the
Bleaken took my ornaments,

29:55.914 --> 29:57.725
- 'cause it could have been anyone.
- Right, sure.

29:57.749 --> 29:59.182
- But somebody
stole 'em. - Mm-hmm.

29:59.217 --> 30:00.728
And it sure seems like
the kids are right,

30:00.752 --> 30:02.652
that whoever stole them
is inside this building

30:02.687 --> 30:04.887
- right here, the one we're
standing in right now. - Mm...

30:04.923 --> 30:07.323
So, I'm staying till
I find my ornaments.

30:07.358 --> 30:09.158
- Yes!
- But you can take the kids home.

30:09.194 --> 30:11.527
- What, wait, what?
- I'm not leaving you here.

30:11.563 --> 30:13.496
- Neither am I.
- I think she'll be fine.

30:13.531 --> 30:15.264
Wait, I-I'm staying with Mom.

30:15.300 --> 30:16.899
Me, too. Who said she'll be fine?

30:16.935 --> 30:18.501
That sounded cowardly.

30:18.536 --> 30:21.070
Okay, we'll try and find
whoever stole the ornaments.

30:21.106 --> 30:22.839
- The Bleaken.
- Not the Bleaken.

30:22.874 --> 30:24.340
But you all stay behind me,

30:24.375 --> 30:26.175
and we leave in 20
minutes, no matter what.

30:26.211 --> 30:28.111
- Tina, give me the ruler.
- No.

30:28.146 --> 30:30.420
- Tina.
- Fine. Let me show you how to use it.

30:30.447 --> 30:31.544
Ow.

30:32.951 --> 30:34.450
I can't believe we're doing this.

30:34.486 --> 30:36.219
Such a bad idea. Such a bad idea.

30:36.254 --> 30:37.553
Such a bad idea.

30:37.589 --> 30:38.766
That's great, Dad, great for morale.

32:03.842 --> 32:06.943

Okay, we should definitely turn back.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.214
Bob, that thing can be explained.

32:11.249 --> 32:12.648
I don't know how, but it can.

32:12.684 --> 32:14.450
We got to keep going. It's like IKEA.

32:14.485 --> 32:15.996
We can't go back. We
got to push forward.

32:16.020 --> 32:18.354
Watch out for Swedish meatballs.

32:18.389 --> 32:21.023
Oh, okay, fine, we'll
go toward the thing

32:21.059 --> 32:22.821
with feathers and the deer head.

32:29.567 --> 32:31.167
All right, I'm gonna open this a crack,

32:31.202 --> 32:33.502
even though every part of
me tells me not to do this.

32:33.632 --> 32:34.798
Everyone stand back.

32:35.571 --> 32:37.189
Oh, you're standing way back.

32:37.214 --> 32:38.875
That's good.

32:40.211 --> 32:41.644
What is it? What do you see?

32:41.679 --> 32:45.181
It's, uh, not what I expected.

32:45.216 --> 32:47.149
It's not a horrible pit of death?

32:47.185 --> 32:51.254
Hmm, I mean, it depends on how
you feel about trance music.

32:51.289 --> 32:52.688
Is this Moby's house?

32:52.724 --> 32:53.923
Oh, it's a...

32:55.193 --> 32:57.326
- ... rave.
- Yup. Just a rave.

32:57.362 --> 32:58.539
Whoever these people are,

32:58.563 --> 33:00.263
they have a lot of creative ideas.

33:00.298 --> 33:02.765
Like the illusion wall
and the secret staircase.

33:02.800 --> 33:04.245
So instead of the Bleaken's nest,

33:04.269 --> 33:06.702
we get a bunch of people
dancing like nobody's watching?

33:06.738 --> 33:07.904
What a rip-off.

33:07.939 --> 33:09.505
Look!

33:09.540 --> 33:11.507
Whoa. Mom's tree.

33:11.542 --> 33:13.109
Everyone, we're leaving in a second.

33:13.144 --> 33:15.745
Right after I get my
frickin' treetop back.

33:15.780 --> 33:18.886
Mom is literally raving mad.

33:21.629 --> 33:23.428
I bet all this stuff is stolen.

33:23.464 --> 33:25.831
Yeah. And that guy stole my dance move.

33:25.866 --> 33:27.210
I think that's the reading reindeer

33:27.234 --> 33:28.600
from in front of the library.

33:28.636 --> 33:30.002
I recognize his glasses.

33:30.037 --> 33:31.970
Stupid... young people.

33:32.006 --> 33:34.184
They think they can just take
things for their fancy rave.

33:34.208 --> 33:36.441
Don't worry, Lin, we're
gonna get your tree back.

33:36.477 --> 33:38.277
I mean, it's really high up, but...

33:38.312 --> 33:39.678
Hey, everyone.

33:39.713 --> 33:41.213
DJ Elev-8 here.

33:41.248 --> 33:43.282
That's spelled with the number eight.

33:43.317 --> 33:46.552
And this is asinine
with the number nine.

33:46.587 --> 33:49.187
Just a few minutes left until
the clock strikes midnight

33:49.223 --> 33:51.189
and it's officially Christmas morning.

33:51.225 --> 33:53.144
You all know what that means.

33:53.169 --> 33:55.369
It's time to elev-8!

33:56.787 --> 33:59.000
- Ugh. Unbelievable.
- Okay, I think if we just

33:59.025 --> 34:01.292
quietly and inconspicuously
make our way over to...

34:01.317 --> 34:02.750
I'm gonna get on that microphone

34:02.775 --> 34:04.575
and give these people
a piece of my mind.

34:04.600 --> 34:05.733
Please don't do that, Lin.

34:05.768 --> 34:07.201
Please do that, Mom.

34:07.236 --> 34:08.569
Bob, you go get my treetop.

34:08.603 --> 34:10.806
Kids, you stand underneath
your father in case he falls.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.239
I got a party to poop on.

34:12.275 --> 34:13.873
Oh, my God, that's so high up.

34:13.909 --> 34:15.884
This is what I thought 
a rave looked like.

34:15.909 --> 34:19.580
But it is not what I
thought a rave smelled like.

34:19.614 --> 34:21.748
Okay. I can't take the smell anymore.

34:21.784 --> 34:23.449
I got to move away from the dog poop.

34:23.485 --> 34:24.752
Damn it.

34:24.786 --> 34:25.985
Oh... whoa, oh, whoa!

34:27.590 --> 34:30.123
Just got to get my arms
under me, like a push-up.

34:30.159 --> 34:31.759
Just got to do one push-up.

34:33.094 --> 34:34.562
What's wrong with me?

34:34.597 --> 34:35.663
I can't do one push-up?

34:40.701 --> 34:45.072
Oh, God. This is really
the stupidest way to die.

34:45.107 --> 34:46.674
Don't worry, Dad. You're not gonna die.

34:46.708 --> 34:48.520
I mean, if you fall, it
would be a tough road back,

34:48.543 --> 34:50.110
but you're not gonna die.

34:50.146 --> 34:52.513
Yeah, I bet Santa falls
off roofs all the time,

34:52.547 --> 34:54.949
and he's only in slightly
better shape than you.

34:54.984 --> 34:57.451
Just for the record, your
butt crack's not totally out.

34:57.486 --> 34:59.186
I know it, I feel it.

34:59.222 --> 35:00.493
I feel the breeze.

35:02.291 --> 35:04.491
Hello! Hello, people!

35:04.527 --> 35:06.227
Uh, can I have your attention please?

35:06.262 --> 35:07.272
Hey. What the... ? Get off of that.

35:07.296 --> 35:08.540
Get off... get off it... Give it to me!

35:08.564 --> 35:10.331
What are you doing?
I'm killing that mic.

35:10.366 --> 35:11.799
Where's that damn switch?

35:11.834 --> 35:13.367
I know you're all having a fun time

35:13.402 --> 35:16.136
in your little rave cave,
but I need to say something.

35:16.172 --> 35:19.039
Normally, I would love to
be doing a rave with you,

35:19.075 --> 35:20.474
but this is bull crap.

35:20.509 --> 35:22.476
This is not what Christmas is about.

35:22.511 --> 35:25.846
It's not about stealing
things, and secret tunnels.

35:25.882 --> 35:27.392
We don't have a permit for this.

35:27.416 --> 35:29.350
That's why we have all those things.

35:29.385 --> 35:31.552
To keep people out... Who brought her?

35:31.587 --> 35:33.654
And no one stole anything!

35:33.689 --> 35:35.827
Oh, go play ping pong
with your ding dong.

35:35.852 --> 35:38.459
You know full well what you
did, you Christmas burglars.

35:38.494 --> 35:40.027
Look, you took my treetop.

35:40.062 --> 35:41.362
Uh, hi.

35:41.397 --> 35:42.463
So we're taking it back.

35:42.498 --> 35:43.864
And my ornaments.

35:43.900 --> 35:45.566
But you know what I can't get back?

37:26.135 --> 37:28.769
No. I'm-I'm a person. In a costume.

37:28.804 --> 37:31.238
Well, just so you know,
we could've taken him.

37:31.273 --> 37:32.773
- Right, guys?
- Yeah!

37:32.808 --> 37:35.009
We would've sent him
back to Bleakentown.

37:35.044 --> 37:38.012

know how it would've gone down.

37:41.650 --> 37:43.350
Don't turn me off. I want to apologize.

37:43.386 --> 37:45.686
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

37:45.721 --> 37:47.421
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

37:47.456 --> 37:50.858
I didn't realize how
w-wonderful this party was.

37:50.893 --> 37:52.326
I-I... I couldn't see you.

37:52.361 --> 37:53.660
I thought you were dumb kids.

37:53.696 --> 37:54.962
I'm 23.

37:54.997 --> 37:56.497
I thought Christmas gave up on me,

37:56.532 --> 37:58.932
but... but maybe I gave up on Christmas.

37:58.968 --> 38:00.701
Can you tell us all this later?

38:00.736 --> 38:03.937
Wait, wait, listen! I, uh,
I have to confess something.

38:03.973 --> 38:06.540
Uh, something I did that I
feel really, really bad about

38:06.575 --> 38:08.342
and now I wish I could undo.

38:08.377 --> 38:10.455
I called the cops and told them
the Christmas thieves are here

38:10.479 --> 38:11.879
and they're on their way. I'm sorry.

38:11.914 --> 38:13.213
Oh, no.

38:13.249 --> 38:14.481
You called the cops?

38:14.517 --> 38:15.682
They're gonna shut us down.

38:15.718 --> 38:17.151
I know! I'm so sorry.

38:17.186 --> 38:18.385
I'm really, really sorry.

38:18.421 --> 38:21.009
- Hi, Marshmallow.
- Mm-mm.

38:21.869 --> 38:24.953
I'm sorry I called the cops.
I feel terrible.

38:24.978 --> 38:28.079
It was dark, and I couldn't
see all your beautiful faces.

38:28.115 --> 38:30.782
You called the cops and
ruined our Christmas party.

38:30.817 --> 38:33.918
-This party is all I have.
-Okay, I'll be honest,

38:33.954 --> 38:35.887
I have a couple different
things going on tonight,

38:35.922 --> 38:37.455
so I was gonna leave,
like, a little early,

38:37.491 --> 38:38.890
but this is still not cool, Linda.

38:38.925 --> 38:41.008
Okay, I admit it. I ruined your party.

38:41.033 --> 38:42.566
I just got so mad.

38:42.601 --> 38:44.790
I-I freaked out 'cause
you stole my ornaments.

38:44.830 --> 38:47.230
For the last time, lady, we
didn't steal your ornaments.

38:47.265 --> 38:48.365
Well, someone did!

38:48.400 --> 38:49.966
I did.

38:50.001 --> 38:52.702
Art, the naked artist guy?

38:52.738 --> 38:55.845
I confess. I stole your
tree, and these lights,

38:55.870 --> 38:57.073
and I did it by myself.

38:57.109 --> 38:59.609
Don't blame anyone else
here, it was all me.

38:59.644 --> 39:01.911
And to think I gave you drugs.

39:01.947 --> 39:03.480
But why?

39:03.515 --> 39:05.882
I was put in charge
of decorations.

39:05.917 --> 39:07.150
I didn't have any money.

39:07.185 --> 39:08.785
And I didn't think it
was hurting anyone

39:08.820 --> 39:11.054
if I borrowed a few
things here and there.

39:11.089 --> 39:12.789
I borrowed them, kind of.

39:12.824 --> 39:14.124
And then I put all this up.

39:14.159 --> 39:15.959
Oh, it is beautiful.

39:15.994 --> 39:18.395
- Oh, I know.
- So how'd you boost our spruce?

39:18.430 --> 39:21.498
I hid it in the Dumpster in your
alley when I left your party.

39:21.533 --> 39:23.767
You threw my tree in a Dumpster?

39:23.802 --> 39:27.237
I placed it, I placed it in
the dumpster, very carefully.

39:27.272 --> 39:29.072
Right next to some old meat.

39:29.107 --> 39:32.409
And then, after I finished my
nuding, I came back for it.

39:32.444 --> 39:35.011
It's just, this party's
usually at The Wiggle Room,

39:35.046 --> 39:37.080
and it always looks amazing.

39:37.115 --> 39:39.182
And I know it's important
to a lot of people,

39:39.217 --> 39:40.622
and I just...

39:40.856 --> 39:43.987
I had a dream of making it
look beautiful in here,

39:44.022 --> 39:46.356
to bring people a
little bit of light.

39:46.391 --> 39:49.359
I had the exact same dream.

39:49.394 --> 39:51.528
That's why I threw
my Christmas party.

39:51.563 --> 39:53.129
This one was way better though.

39:53.165 --> 39:54.931
They were both good. Who's to say?

39:54.966 --> 39:56.332
- I mean...
- Well, I...

39:56.368 --> 39:58.435
They're here! The cops are outside!

39:58.470 --> 40:00.537
Well, I guess that's that. Party's over.

40:00.572 --> 40:02.472
Oh, my God, I am so late
for this next thing.

40:02.507 --> 40:03.840
I would honestly bring you all,

40:03.875 --> 40:05.642
but I don't even
have a plus-one,

40:05.677 --> 40:08.445
so I doubt it would be cool to
show up with, like, 500 people.

40:08.480 --> 40:10.447
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.

40:10.482 --> 40:11.815
This party's not over.

40:11.850 --> 40:13.283
Bob, what do you mean?

40:13.318 --> 40:15.018
Look, we called the cops.

40:15.053 --> 40:17.220
I mean, you called the cops,
I never would've done that.

40:17.255 --> 40:20.557
The least we can do is save the party.
I have a plan.

40:20.592 --> 40:22.358
I just need that costume.

40:22.394 --> 40:24.727
Dad's about to get horny!

40:25.233 --> 40:27.464
Where's the god-dang door?

40:27.499 --> 40:29.299
- Hey!
- What the...?

40:29.334 --> 40:31.501
Over here! I'm the Christmas thief!

40:31.536 --> 40:32.802
The Bleaken is real.

40:32.838 --> 40:33.970
Come and get me!

40:35.507 --> 40:37.540
Ooh, hit him with the car.
This will be fun.

40:37.576 --> 40:40.076
Do it.

40:40.111 --> 40:41.511
It worked. They're chasing him.

40:41.546 --> 40:44.219
The cops left. Party back on!

40:47.781 --> 40:48.947
All right!

40:49.016 --> 40:50.415
Ah!

40:50.451 --> 40:52.918
I'm up. Stronger than ever.

40:55.589 --> 40:57.422
I think I lost them.

40:58.792 --> 41:00.225
Oh, my God, the Bleaken's real.

41:04.784 --> 41:06.643
-Bleaken?
-Santa?

41:06.675 --> 41:07.974
-Bob?
-Teddy?

41:08.010 --> 41:09.509
Oh, thank God, I
thought you were...

41:09.544 --> 41:11.077
uh, what are you doing?

41:11.113 --> 41:14.047
It's a... it's a long story.

41:14.082 --> 41:15.949
Eh, same. It all started earlier,

41:15.984 --> 41:17.450
- when I heard from uh, Bosco, that...
- Uh-oh.

41:17.486 --> 41:18.885
-They're coming.
-Wait.

41:18.920 --> 41:20.387
- Are you running from the cops?
- Yeah, yeah.

41:20.422 --> 41:22.188
Very much. I-I need to hide.

41:22.224 --> 41:23.957
Uh, turns out, I'm bad at that.

41:23.992 --> 41:25.492
I-I think I got the perfect place.

41:25.527 --> 41:28.895
Hmm.

41:28.930 --> 41:30.897
We lost him. Oh, well.

41:30.932 --> 41:33.333
How about we get lost in
some Kung Pao chicken?

41:33.368 --> 41:34.901
This is a great idea.

41:34.936 --> 41:36.569
I knew we could
both fit in here.

41:36.605 --> 41:37.837
-Well, we can kind of fit.
-Yeah.

41:37.873 --> 41:40.340
- I mean, um, it's a little snug.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

41:40.375 --> 41:41.741
Wait. Aren't we right
in front of your house?

41:41.777 --> 41:42.942
Couldn't we have
just gone in there?

41:42.978 --> 41:44.344
- Shh, shh, shh.
- Teddy.

41:44.379 --> 41:45.578
- Aren't we right in...
- Shh, shh, shh.

41:45.614 --> 41:46.946
- Why do you keep...
- Shh, shh, shh.

41:46.982 --> 41:48.882
- Teddy. Why do you keep shushing me?
- What? Yeah.

41:48.917 --> 41:50.450
I thought I heard something.

41:50.485 --> 41:52.352
- Oh, sorry. Yeah.
- Yeah. So stop doing that.

41:52.395 --> 41:54.195
That's why I'm trying to...
stop you from talking.

41:54.222 --> 41:56.389
Why? 'Cause I'm... I
have something to say.

41:56.425 --> 41:58.074
- Yeah, what? Yeah, yeah. Shh.
- I said...

41:58.099 --> 41:59.259
We don't need to hide
here, we could go...

41:59.284 --> 42:00.093
Shh, shh, shh.

42:00.128 --> 42:01.461
- Shh. What?
- I'm leaving.

42:01.496 --> 42:03.029
- No, don't go.
- Good-bye.

42:03.065 --> 42:04.431
- No, don't go.
- Teddy, let go of me.

42:04.466 --> 42:05.732
This is the best Christmas Eve ever.

42:05.767 --> 42:07.233
Don't ruin it.

42:07.269 --> 42:09.969
Well, I guess there's no Bleaken.

42:10.005 --> 42:11.604
I kind of wanted to fight him.

42:11.640 --> 42:13.239
Maybe there is a Bleaken.

42:13.275 --> 42:14.941
Maybe we scared him away with our tough,

42:14.976 --> 42:16.743
badass, positive can-do attitude.

42:16.778 --> 42:17.944
You might be right.

42:17.979 --> 42:19.145
I mean, look at Mom.

42:19.181 --> 42:21.488
I love Christmas!

42:23.121 --> 42:25.238
I love Christmas!

42:25.263 --> 42:27.631
- Mom, did you sleep?
- She hasn't even sat down.

42:27.656 --> 42:29.556
Uh, somebody gave me a little
something at the party.

42:29.591 --> 42:30.990
I feel amazing.

42:31.026 --> 42:32.592
Hold on, I got to lie down for a second.

42:35.263 --> 42:37.597
Isn't she an angel when she sleeps?

42:37.632 --> 42:39.599
Well, Merry Christmas, everybody.

42:39.634 --> 42:41.768
I'm just gonna, uh, feel her pulse.

42:41.803 --> 42:43.737
Yeah, she's okay. She's fine.
