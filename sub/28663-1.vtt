00:20.237 --> 00:22.239
If I were gonna use
one word to describe you,

00:22.283 --> 00:24.198
I think to would be...

00:24.241 --> 00:25.895
"acute."

00:25.938 --> 00:29.420
Your interests are
sort of narrow and limited,

00:29.464 --> 00:33.076
and I'm not using the word
"acute" correctly.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.815
I don't think that's
the right word to describe you.

00:34.817 --> 00:37.124
But your interests
are really sort of...

00:37.167 --> 00:41.171
specific and specialized
and to just a few things like...

00:41.215 --> 00:43.695
fashion and reality television
and your phone.

00:43.739 --> 00:45.480
And that's okay.

00:45.523 --> 00:49.832
And me, I'm a little more
obtuse, you know?

00:49.875 --> 00:51.834
My interests are
a little bit more broad.

00:51.877 --> 00:56.404
I like, um, everything else
that's going on around me.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.884
I like, you know,
being an adult

00:58.928 --> 01:02.323
and culture and arts
and reading in general.

01:02.366 --> 01:05.108
You know, general reading.

01:05.152 --> 01:07.197
And what is see is,

01:07.241 --> 01:11.419
I see you, uh,
going this way

01:11.462 --> 01:15.771
and taking your gorgeous
five-year-old daughter with you,

01:15.814 --> 01:19.296
and you guys
are gonna go that way.

01:19.340 --> 01:22.038
I'm here.
I've always been here.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.127
But now I'm heading this way.

01:24.171 --> 01:28.175
So we are heading in these
two directions separately.

01:28.218 --> 01:30.002
And, um...

01:30.046 --> 01:31.917
That's, uh...

01:31.961 --> 01:35.965
That's kind of like a weird
cinnamon Pop-Tart, that flavor.

01:36.008 --> 01:37.706
I think it's a good thing
that we're separate now.

01:37.749 --> 01:40.361
I think that we've had
a fantastic time,

01:40.404 --> 01:43.842
and now is the time
to let bygones be bygones

01:43.886 --> 01:45.844
and just sort of
call it a day.

School.

My lord, Master Youngblood,
the rebel planet is closing in.

05:52.264 --> 05:55.398
Look at that. That man's
a half-a-horse, isn't he?

05:55.442 --> 05:57.182
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hm.

05:57.226 --> 05:59.228
Prepare the armies, Petar.

05:59.271 --> 06:02.187
But, sir,
we'll surely be stricken down

06:02.231 --> 06:04.799
by the insurmountable might
of their armies.

06:04.842 --> 06:06.583
You may be immortal, sir,

06:06.627 --> 06:08.150
but our armies,
they'll be snuffed out

06:08.193 --> 06:09.891

Oh.

Hmm.

Hey, Dad.

Hey, sweetie. How are you?

- I'm good. How are you?
- I'm good.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.493
Look at your hair.
Turn your head to the side.

06:46.536 --> 06:48.364
Oh, my God,
it's really short.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.974
- I cut it.
- You did cut it.

06:50.018 --> 06:52.890
You cut it all off.
It looks really good.

06:52.934 --> 06:56.503
Thank you.
How've you been? What's new?

06:56.546 --> 06:59.723
What is that behind you?
Is that a parrot?

06:59.767 --> 07:02.683
A cockatoo.
I didn't pick it out.

07:02.726 --> 07:04.902

All right, so am I
picking you up at the airport,

07:14.303 --> 07:15.652
or you staying with
your mother again?

07:15.696 --> 07:18.394
Oh, I totally forgot.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.961
I can't come this week.

07:20.004 --> 07:21.266
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

07:21.310 --> 07:22.920
You're breaking up.

07:22.964 --> 07:24.879
You sounded like you said
you're not coming.

07:24.922 --> 07:27.490

this week with some friends,

07:32.669 --> 07:34.062
and it's kind of important.

07:34.105 --> 07:35.324
We already booked it
and everything.

07:35.367 --> 07:37.239
Oh, God, Big Sur.

07:37.282 --> 07:39.415
Big Sur is fantastic.

07:39.459 --> 07:43.854
Yeah. It's gonna be great.
I wish you were there.

07:43.898 --> 07:46.291
Well, you know,

07:46.335 --> 07:48.772
actually, I'm gonna be up
at Creature Con

07:48.816 --> 07:50.426
in San Francisco this weekend.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.123
I could just take the car.
I could drive up.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.516
Oh!

07:53.560 --> 07:55.518
I could stay with you
for a few days.

07:55.562 --> 07:58.826
Yeah, yeah, that could work.
I mean, I think--

07:58.869 --> 08:00.958
I don't know if we have
any extra rooms or anything.

08:01.002 --> 08:03.178
I'm easy. I'm totally easy.
All I need is a bed.

08:03.221 --> 08:05.746
Okay.

08:05.789 --> 08:07.617
So you're gonna come.

08:07.661 --> 08:09.924
I'm gonna come. I'm coming.

08:09.967 --> 08:12.579
Okay, great.

08:14.842 --> 08:16.017
Fuck.

08:21.109 --> 08:22.937
Fuck!

08:22.980 --> 08:26.593
So fucking fuck. I don't know
what to do about it.

08:26.636 --> 08:28.943
They say it's gonna take a week
to get some part.

08:28.986 --> 08:31.989
No, a week.

08:32.033 --> 08:34.339
I'll get there. I just--

08:34.383 --> 08:35.558
Nic.

08:35.602 --> 08:36.732
God.

08:36.777 --> 08:41.738
So you don't want me to come?

08:41.782 --> 08:43.523
It's not that.

08:43.566 --> 08:47.701
I just wanna reconnect with Nic
and tell her in person.

08:47.744 --> 08:50.138
You can totally do all of that
with me there.

08:50.181 --> 08:52.314
Yeah, maybe, but she's always
a bit standoffish

08:52.357 --> 08:53.707
whenever I bring around
the girl

08:53.750 --> 08:55.622
that ended my marriage
to her mother.

08:55.665 --> 08:58.494
- Hey, hey, whoa! Baby!
- What?

08:58.538 --> 09:01.018

it's totally safe for the baby.

09:01.062 --> 09:02.629

real smoking.

09:02.672 --> 09:04.674
Okay, well,
this isn't a real gun,

09:04.718 --> 09:06.154
but you can't do this
at a cop.

09:06.197 --> 09:07.808
It's bad.

09:07.851 --> 09:10.550
Why can't you just like call her
or send her a text?

09:10.593 --> 09:12.421
Why do you have to be
so dramatical?

09:12.464 --> 09:14.641
She's my daughter.
I'm not gonna send her

09:14.684 --> 09:16.643
some pacifier and confetti

09:16.686 --> 09:19.776

13:49.829 --> 13:52.875
Yeah, I went to Berkeley
for a minute.

13:52.919 --> 13:55.356
- She sort of saved me.
- Thank you so much.

13:55.399 --> 13:57.488
I met Nic in psych class.

13:57.532 --> 14:00.230
So what'd you major in?

14:00.274 --> 14:02.667
I didn't finish.

14:04.669 --> 14:06.889
Oh, okay, well, no judgment.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.891
I'm not your parent.

14:08.935 --> 14:11.198
I assume they were cool with it.

14:11.241 --> 14:14.505
There is no they, just him.

14:14.549 --> 14:16.551
And no.

Okay, I think I know
what that means.

14:19.249 --> 14:22.513
Not on good terms
with your mom, huh?

14:22.557 --> 14:24.689
Yeah, hard to be on good terms
with someone who's dead.

14:24.733 --> 14:26.909
Okay, do you have
a problem with me?

14:26.953 --> 14:28.693

the fucking bullshit, man?

come and pick me up

14:30.957 --> 14:32.349

saving the fucking day.

You think you're on good terms
with Nic? You're not.

14:42.316 --> 14:44.535
One decent year doesn't make up
for a lifetime of fuckups.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.798

my daughter better than I do

14:46.842 --> 14:48.365

- I can send this to you.

15:16.132 --> 15:18.134
Is it weird having fans?

15:18.178 --> 15:21.181
It's a little weird, especially
when I'm having an argument

15:21.224 --> 15:22.530

when they look at the picture

15:26.926 --> 15:28.536

in the background,

15:28.579 --> 15:30.494
giving you the finger.

15:30.538 --> 15:33.280
- You did that?
- Maybe.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.808
I'm sorry I made you cry.

15:39.851 --> 15:42.289
Yeah, you did.

Hey, sweetie.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.261
- Oh, it's good to see you.
- You too.

27:34.304 --> 27:36.002
- How was the drive?
- It was good, it was good.

27:36.045 --> 27:38.439
Kim is quality company.

27:40.833 --> 27:42.661
- Hey.
- Hi, babe.

27:52.061 --> 27:54.324
- Missed you.
- Missed you too.

27:54.368 --> 27:56.109
- How was the drive?
- Drive was good.

27:56.152 --> 27:57.937
Oh, you look so cute.

28:15.650 --> 28:19.872
I don't want to be too dramatic,
but, uh...

28:19.915 --> 28:22.744
I didn't really know how
to tell you over the phone.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.354
I just kind of went with it.

28:24.398 --> 28:28.881
No, it's, it's good.
Whatever, um...

28:28.924 --> 28:32.493
I think it's great, you know,
as long as you're happy, right?

28:32.536 --> 28:35.844
Love is love. It's...

28:35.888 --> 28:38.629
This is wonderful, I think.

28:38.673 --> 28:41.110
Thanks.

28:41.154 --> 28:44.548
I don't have anything I can say
that isn't gonna come out weird,

28:44.592 --> 28:47.116
to let you know
that I'm down with this.

28:47.160 --> 28:50.293
Maybe just-- Really.
Just double thumbs up.

28:52.252 --> 28:54.210
Thanks. That means a lot.

28:56.647 --> 28:57.779
You're taking this really well.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.650
Yeah, yeah, well, it's okay.

28:59.694 --> 29:01.957
This is-- It's okay.

29:02.001 --> 29:04.830
A lot of things in nature
are gay, right?

29:04.873 --> 29:06.962
Did you know
that bees are gay?

29:07.006 --> 29:10.009
No. I don't think
bees are gay, actually.

29:10.052 --> 29:12.272
No, I thought they are.
They're not?

29:12.315 --> 29:14.100
- No.
- Goddamn!

29:14.143 --> 29:16.276
Those close-minded bees, right?

29:16.319 --> 29:18.234
I thought they were
more progressive.

29:22.282 --> 29:24.110
Do you want me to help you
with your bags?

29:24.153 --> 29:25.807
Sure, that'd be great.
Thank you.

29:25.851 --> 29:27.635
Okay.

29:32.074 --> 29:34.337
- Let me help you, honey.
- I got it.

29:39.865 --> 29:42.171
Boy, it's really beautiful here!

29:55.924 --> 29:57.926
Oh, hey.

29:57.970 --> 30:01.147
Oh, hi. I'm Tamara.
Nice to meet you.

30:01.190 --> 30:04.715
I'm Walter. I'm Nic's dad.

30:04.759 --> 30:06.326
Yeah, I know.

30:06.369 --> 30:08.632
Hey. Paula.

30:08.676 --> 30:10.983
Oh.

30:11.026 --> 30:12.723
Nice.

30:12.767 --> 30:13.681
You okay?

30:15.074 --> 30:19.774
Yeah, I'm okay.
It is what it is.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.037
I just wish I would've been
there for you at the funeral.

30:22.081 --> 30:24.561
No, don't. You couldn't
have been there anyway.

30:24.605 --> 30:26.563
I told you my family
would've freaked out.

30:26.607 --> 30:29.871
I know, but I just want you
to know that I'm here for you.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.351
- I know.
- I love you.

30:31.394 --> 30:33.135
I love you too.

30:34.571 --> 30:35.877
- I gotta help.
- No.

30:35.921 --> 30:37.618
- Come on.
- No!

30:37.661 --> 30:39.446
I'm Moon.

30:39.489 --> 30:41.361
I'm--

30:41.404 --> 30:43.363
Is that your name? Moon?

30:43.406 --> 30:46.583
Yes. Moon.

30:48.455 --> 30:50.370
I made you a dream catcher.

30:52.024 --> 30:53.286
Oh.

30:55.462 --> 30:59.118
Thank you. That's very, um...
That was very sweet of you.

31:00.989 --> 31:01.990
Thank you, Moon.

31:08.083 --> 31:10.346
I'm gonna go talk
to the next person now.

31:10.390 --> 31:11.957
- Okay.
- Okay.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.567
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.177
- You're Nic's dad.
- Yeah.

31:15.221 --> 31:17.658
So nice to finally meet you.

31:17.701 --> 31:19.399
- Yeah, I'm Walter.
- I'm Brian.

31:19.442 --> 31:20.530
- Brian?
- Yes.

31:20.574 --> 31:22.054
That's my dad's name.

31:22.097 --> 31:23.533
- What?
- Yeah.

31:23.577 --> 31:25.492
You're dad,
does he spell it with a Y?

31:25.535 --> 31:27.059
No, no, with an I.

31:27.102 --> 31:29.670
Oh, my God.
That's how I spell it.

31:29.713 --> 31:32.542
- That's so weird.
- That's the weirdest thing.

31:32.586 --> 31:34.762
Wow. Small world.

31:34.805 --> 31:37.678
This is where
you're gonna be staying.

31:37.721 --> 31:39.201
It's technically
Moon River's room,

31:39.245 --> 31:41.987
but she's been exclusively
in that teepee.

31:42.030 --> 31:44.293
Wow. This is great.

31:44.337 --> 31:47.296
Yeah.

31:47.340 --> 31:49.995
So listen, Nic.

31:50.038 --> 31:53.737
I-I really am cool

31:53.781 --> 31:57.089
with... everything.

31:58.177 --> 32:00.396
Cool, well, I appreciate it.

32:00.440 --> 32:04.183
I didn't know how you were
gonna react, actually.

32:04.226 --> 32:06.750
I... Mom took a couple days
to adjust.

32:06.794 --> 32:09.710
You told your mom?
When'd you do that?

32:09.753 --> 32:12.539
Recently, like within
the last year or so.

32:12.582 --> 32:17.239
Um, I just never really knew
how to tell you, you know?

32:17.283 --> 32:19.241
You just tell me,
you know.

32:23.115 --> 32:26.031
I mean, I'm cool.
I'm around.

32:26.074 --> 32:27.728
Well, yeah.

32:27.771 --> 32:30.252
I mean, now, yeah.

32:30.296 --> 32:34.256
I just-- You can...
You can tell me anything.

32:35.692 --> 32:37.303
- Okay.
- No judgment.

32:37.346 --> 32:38.565
Thanks.

32:38.608 --> 32:42.438
Nic!
Ready for the hike?

32:42.482 --> 32:44.136
Yeah, I forgot.
We're actually...

32:44.179 --> 32:46.138
We're gonna go on a hike,
if you want to join.

32:46.181 --> 32:48.009
- We're going to the falls.
- Oh, really? Fun.

32:48.053 --> 32:49.968
- It's incredible.
- I'll get my running shoes.

32:50.011 --> 32:51.708
I mean, if you're up for it.

32:51.752 --> 32:53.406
I don't know if you're
exhausted from the drive.

32:53.449 --> 32:54.494
It's kind of strenuous.

32:54.537 --> 32:56.191
Nic, I'm from Los Angeles.

32:56.235 --> 32:57.888
We're a hiking people.

32:57.932 --> 32:58.933
Okay.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.065
Hiking is what we do.

33:00.108 --> 33:01.501
- Okay.
- Okay.

33:01.544 --> 33:03.024
Cool.

33:03.068 --> 33:04.808
- You can settle in.
- All right.

33:15.602 --> 33:17.560
Hey, babe, you want
to come on the hike,

33:17.604 --> 33:19.475
or you're still not
feeling so good?

33:19.519 --> 33:22.870
Yeah, I think I'm just gonna
sit this one out, babe.

33:22.913 --> 33:25.046
Are you sure?
A little fresh air might help.

33:25.090 --> 33:27.092
- The waterfall's unreal.
- I bet.

33:27.135 --> 33:29.529
It's just a long drive.
I'm tired.

33:29.572 --> 33:31.270
Okay, no worries.

33:31.313 --> 33:34.055
Paula and Moon are staying back
if you want to get dinner going.

33:34.099 --> 33:35.796
Yeah, of course.
That sounds good.

33:35.839 --> 33:38.973
Okay. We'll be back
in an hour or two. I love you.

33:43.151 --> 33:45.675
- Come on, you ready to hike?
- Am I ready?

33:45.719 --> 33:46.937
Try to keep up.

33:54.249 --> 33:56.730
It's so nice out.

33:56.773 --> 34:00.342
I love this trail.
I know.

34:00.386 --> 34:02.388
I came here
like five years ago,

34:02.431 --> 34:05.913
and it's really
overgrown actually.

34:05.956 --> 34:09.351
It's really pretty,
especially in the summer.

34:19.143 --> 34:24.844
♪♪

34:30.155 --> 34:32.112
I think we're really close.

34:32.157 --> 34:33.853
It's just up here.

34:33.897 --> 34:36.813
- You okay back there, Dad?
- Okay!

34:38.728 --> 34:41.382
Actually, I think
I need to stop.

34:41.427 --> 34:44.864
- Here, have some water.
- I'm actually gonna die.

34:44.908 --> 34:46.518
Thank you.

34:46.562 --> 34:48.521
Hey, I don't wanna
make this weird,

34:48.563 --> 34:53.047
but I can't believe I'm on
a hike with Master Youngblood.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.223
I can't believe
you watch that show.

34:55.266 --> 34:56.964
Are you kidding me?

34:57.007 --> 35:00.141
"If you need me,
there I shall be."

35:00.185 --> 35:01.403
Faigon!

35:01.447 --> 35:03.492
What in the hell is that?

35:03.536 --> 35:06.191
Call of Faigon's breath.

35:06.234 --> 35:09.063
That show like
was my childhood.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.457
I bet Nic knows every line.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.589
I actually never really
cared for sci-fi.

35:13.633 --> 35:15.200
I like documentaries.

35:15.243 --> 35:17.811
Well, it was fantasy.

35:17.854 --> 35:19.595
I liked Youngblood.

35:56.545 --> 35:58.634
This is amazing.

36:00.114 --> 36:01.898
How was it?

36:01.942 --> 36:03.813
Oh, my God,
what is that smell?

36:03.857 --> 36:05.815
Dinner.

36:05.859 --> 36:08.514
It's like a serious
thick mold or something.

36:08.557 --> 36:11.430
- Thanks.
- What does that mean?

36:11.473 --> 36:15.260
No, I mean, it's like a fungus.
Nobody else smells that?

36:15.303 --> 36:18.176
- Moon, help me out.
- Hmm?

36:18.219 --> 36:19.873
Dad, how about you
go get cleaned up for dinner?

Yeah, good idea.

Hey, Kim, I think I left
something in your bag.

- After dinner.

36:31.624 --> 36:33.582
Okay.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.025
It's like tomato paste.

Hmm?

- Okay.

37:06.398 --> 37:09.139

- Mmm!

37:09.183 --> 37:11.707
Dragon bean?

37:11.751 --> 37:14.667
So were the weapons
on set real?

37:14.710 --> 37:16.843
Yeah, yeah.
I mean, they were dull.

37:16.886 --> 37:19.062
They dull the blades
so nobody can get cut,

37:19.106 --> 37:20.673
except I was stabbed
in the head once.

37:20.716 --> 37:21.978
I was stabbed in the head.

37:22.022 --> 37:25.417
- You nailed the okra.
- Oh, thank you.

37:25.460 --> 37:27.984
Twisted his ankle 'cause he got
one of his hooves caught.

37:28.028 --> 37:29.682
He's a total trooper.

37:29.725 --> 37:31.249
I love Petar.

37:31.292 --> 37:33.076
- Oh, this is amazing.
- Yeah, it's all right.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.643
Pass the pepper, babe.

37:34.687 --> 37:36.297
Dad, can you pass Kim
the pepper?

37:36.341 --> 37:39.126
A friend to the end.

37:39.169 --> 37:41.476
Thanks.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.304
He was so cute.

37:43.348 --> 37:45.001
I never wanted
to marry a horse but him.

37:50.311 --> 37:53.619
How was your journey
with Kim, Walter?

37:53.662 --> 37:55.055
Was it fulfilling?

37:55.098 --> 37:57.275
Sure.

37:57.318 --> 38:01.191
It was uneventful, but...

38:01.235 --> 38:03.933
it was beautiful scenery.

38:09.156 --> 38:11.332
Um, you know,

38:11.376 --> 38:14.640
I'd like to
take this opportunity

38:14.683 --> 38:18.426
to thank you guys
for having this meal outside.

38:18.470 --> 38:20.820
It really de-fumigated
the whole situation.

38:20.863 --> 38:23.779
And thank you Paula
for not giving me a mushroom.

38:23.823 --> 38:25.477
You're welcome, Walter.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.740
And a special shout-out
to Tamara for the hot sauce.

38:27.783 --> 38:29.829
You're a lifesaver,
girlfriend.

38:29.872 --> 38:31.657
Thank you, all.
Thank you for having me.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.702
Lovely, lovely.

38:33.746 --> 38:35.965
AÀ votre santé.

38:39.839 --> 38:43.146
Also, um...

38:43.190 --> 38:44.974
I would like to know...

38:45.018 --> 38:46.976
I have a few questions,
if it's okay to ask.

38:47.020 --> 38:48.674
And they're probably stupid,
I'm sure.

38:48.717 --> 38:49.849
- Okay.
- But...

38:49.892 --> 38:51.764
I'm gonna give you three.

38:51.807 --> 38:53.113
No judgment. Fire away.

38:53.156 --> 38:55.942
- Okay.
- You're generous.

38:55.985 --> 38:59.424
What is the dynamic with y'alls?
What's going on here?

38:59.467 --> 39:03.384
I know there's some pretty
interesting vibes flying around.

39:03.428 --> 39:07.736
And I understand you and you,

39:07.780 --> 39:12.654
and I kind of feel you and you
and you and you.

39:12.698 --> 39:15.135
What is it though?
What's going on with you guys?

39:15.178 --> 39:17.703
I'll bite.
We're together. We're gay.

39:17.746 --> 39:19.487
Hey, I'm not gay.

39:20.967 --> 39:22.447
Oh, well, you turned her.

39:24.187 --> 39:25.885
Um...

39:25.928 --> 39:28.453
I, for one,
think labels are harmful.

39:31.064 --> 39:33.458
I love what I love.

39:33.501 --> 39:35.895
Okay. I don't know
what that means.

39:35.938 --> 39:38.288
I'm bisexual,
and I've been known to dabble.

39:38.332 --> 39:40.334
- She's a dabbler.
- Dabble away, girlfriend.

39:40.378 --> 39:41.640
Big-time dabbler.

39:41.683 --> 39:44.382
Yabble dabble do.

39:44.425 --> 39:46.688
I don't know
what that means either.

39:46.732 --> 39:50.126
Um, what-- How many more
questions do I have?

39:50.170 --> 39:51.606
Two? Okay.

39:51.650 --> 39:56.306
So who is the guy
in the relationship?

39:56.350 --> 39:57.786
Who's the man?

39:57.830 --> 39:59.440
We're both girls.

39:59.484 --> 40:01.311
There is no guy, Dad.

40:01.355 --> 40:02.922
It's kind of
old-school thinking.

40:02.965 --> 40:04.402
It's a little sexist, actually.

40:04.445 --> 40:06.534
What happened to no judgment?

40:06.578 --> 40:08.144
I'm just saying
who's the instigator.

40:08.188 --> 40:09.668
I just want to know who,

40:09.711 --> 40:11.670
who holds the door open
for the other naturally?

40:11.713 --> 40:14.934
- Who offers to pay the bill?
- We both do.

40:14.977 --> 40:16.283
I think you held the door open
this morning,

40:16.326 --> 40:17.937
I held the door open
this afternoon,

40:17.980 --> 40:20.374
and then we just trade.

40:20.418 --> 40:23.203
- It's easy to open a door.
- But there's a schedule.

40:23.246 --> 40:24.726
There's no tendency?

40:24.770 --> 40:27.250
There are no doors.

40:29.339 --> 40:32.517
All right, well,
that takes care of that.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.954
Last question then.

40:34.997 --> 40:37.391
How old were you
when you knew?

40:37.435 --> 40:40.002
When did you know?

40:40.046 --> 40:44.050
Well, when did you first know
that you liked the ladies?

40:44.093 --> 40:47.270
Kindergarten.
First grade, maybe.

40:47.314 --> 40:50.404
Oh, so you were
born straight?

40:50.448 --> 40:53.929

for coming out.

41:07.900 --> 41:09.684

41:09.728 --> 41:12.513

41:12.557 --> 41:15.473
That's why we invited you.

41:15.516 --> 41:17.997

the plan,

41:18.040 --> 41:19.085

41:23.698 --> 41:27.136

41:27.180 --> 41:29.530
eleven days, seven hours,

I really need it.

42:11.485 --> 42:12.617
I can't. Not now.

42:12.660 --> 42:14.009

Thanks again
for the great food.

42:29.459 --> 42:32.941
- What the fuck was that?
- Just keep your voice down.

42:32.985 --> 42:35.117
It was bad enough I showed up
and had it dumped on my head

42:35.161 --> 42:36.902
that I fucked
my daughter's girlfriend.

42:36.945 --> 42:38.294
- Shut up.
- But I'm like, "Fine."

42:38.338 --> 42:39.992
That's okay.
I can keep a secret

42:40.035 --> 42:42.516
because hopefully
your relationship won't last.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.214
But it turns out you're not
temporary at all, are you?

42:45.258 --> 42:46.955
Till death do you part?

42:46.999 --> 42:48.391
That's cute.
The guy who divorced his wife

42:48.435 --> 42:49.784

that marriage is forever.

42:49.828 --> 42:51.569

42:51.612 --> 42:53.396

let's face it, you and I,

52:08.777 --> 52:10.562
People been telling me
how to feel my whole life.

52:10.605 --> 52:12.129
I don't need that from you.

52:12.172 --> 52:13.521
I'm just trying to help, okay?

52:13.565 --> 52:16.045
Yeah, I know, I know.

52:20.093 --> 52:21.094
I'm pruning.

52:29.842 --> 52:34.151
♪♪

52:50.863 --> 52:56.738
♪♪

53:02.266 --> 53:05.312
So...

53:05.356 --> 53:10.752
it's sort of a weird
hypothetical question for you.

53:10.796 --> 53:12.754
If you had a secret,

53:12.798 --> 53:16.280
and you knew that it would
ruin somebody's life,

53:16.323 --> 53:21.198
would you keep it a secret,
or would you come clean?

53:23.417 --> 53:27.856
Well, why would you want
to ruin someone's life?

53:34.385 --> 53:37.214
That's really timid.

53:37.257 --> 53:39.912
Well, maybe you're not
doing it right.

53:39.955 --> 53:43.959
I have a black belt
in smoking pot.

53:44.003 --> 53:46.701
Then you probably
tried this before.

53:56.581 --> 53:57.930
Wow.

53:57.973 --> 53:59.888
That was really
junior high school of you.

54:02.804 --> 54:04.371
Thank you.

54:34.096 --> 54:36.577
Uh, um...

54:36.621 --> 54:38.187
uh...

54:38.231 --> 54:42.801
as amazing and convenient

54:42.844 --> 54:45.412
and perky as this is,

54:45.456 --> 54:49.808
I don't think I can do this.

54:49.851 --> 54:53.725
What's wrong?
Do you have dick issues?

54:53.768 --> 54:56.118
No. No, I don't have
dick issues.

54:56.162 --> 54:58.207
My dick works.

54:58.251 --> 55:00.558
I just...

55:00.601 --> 55:01.950
I shouldn't do this.

55:01.994 --> 55:05.040
I-I can't, and I won't.

55:06.694 --> 55:09.741
Okay, calm down.
It was just for fun.

55:09.784 --> 55:11.569
I know, as fun as it would be

55:11.612 --> 55:14.049
to have sex with
a hot girl named Brian,

55:14.093 --> 55:16.922
I gotta take a pass.

55:16.965 --> 55:19.054
If I did this,

55:19.098 --> 55:22.623
I'd pretty much be
the worst person I ever met.

55:25.496 --> 55:27.976
Well...

55:28.020 --> 55:31.153
I hope tomorrow isn't awkward.

55:31.197 --> 55:34.113
I think tomorrow is going
to be extremely awkward.

55:35.854 --> 55:37.246
Good night.

55:49.128 --> 55:51.043
Hey.

55:51.086 --> 55:52.436
Hey.

55:55.264 --> 55:57.571
I gotta tell you something.

56:00.444 --> 56:02.359
It's about your dad.

56:34.434 --> 56:35.348
Oh, I'm in here.

56:36.610 --> 56:38.830
Oh, oh, that's okay.

56:43.835 --> 56:45.271
I was done, Tamara.

56:46.838 --> 56:48.535
It's a little weird, Moon.

56:48.579 --> 56:50.102
I had a feeling
you were gonna say something.

56:50.145 --> 56:52.147
Do we have any of that
Paulo Santo left

56:52.191 --> 56:56.282
to do like a chakra cleansing
ritual before the ceremony?

56:56.325 --> 56:58.153
Yeah, we should. We had
a lot of that stuff.

56:58.197 --> 56:59.154
Uh, hey.

56:59.198 --> 57:00.939
Morning!

57:00.982 --> 57:01.940
Morning.

57:04.421 --> 57:05.813
You look like shit.

57:05.857 --> 57:07.554
Oh, thank you, Paula.

57:07.598 --> 57:09.600
Thanks for that.

57:09.643 --> 57:11.950
Has anyone seen Nic?

57:11.993 --> 57:14.256
Brides aren't supposed to see
each other before the ceremony.

57:14.300 --> 57:15.562
It's bad luck.

57:25.572 --> 57:27.356
Would you like a hot dog?

57:27.400 --> 57:29.837
They're very good.
I know you probably--

57:29.881 --> 57:32.623
They're gluten-free.
The buns are gluten-free.

57:32.666 --> 57:36.061
You're all so busy suntanning
and doing your selfie-taking.

57:39.412 --> 57:41.980
Walter, how the hell
are you buddy?

57:42.023 --> 57:46.201
Jack.
Not too good, buddy.

57:46.245 --> 57:48.029
Listen, can I run
something by you?

57:48.073 --> 57:49.204
Yeah, sure.

57:49.248 --> 57:50.815
I'll just get into it.

57:50.858 --> 57:53.818
I just found out
my daughter is gay,

57:53.861 --> 57:56.342
which really isn't a problem,
except that I found out

57:56.385 --> 57:59.780
directly after I had sex with
her girlfriend-slash-fiancée.

57:59.824 --> 58:03.349
I'm in Big Sur, and they're
about to get married

58:03.392 --> 58:05.394
in front of a teepee
in about two hours.

58:05.438 --> 58:07.614
Holy shit.

58:07.658 --> 58:09.529
So I'm just thinking about
just coming out with it

58:09.573 --> 58:12.140
and, you know,

58:12.184 --> 58:15.361
just coming out with it
before the wedding.

58:15.404 --> 58:17.450
Is that a good idea?

58:17.494 --> 58:20.584
Should I...
Is that the right thing to do?

58:20.627 --> 58:22.150
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

58:22.194 --> 58:23.804
You had sex with
your daughter's girlfriend?

58:23.848 --> 58:25.197
Yeah.

58:25.240 --> 58:26.633
And you're feeling bad
about that.

58:26.677 --> 58:29.549
Um, I don't follow.

58:30.942 --> 58:32.987
There isn't a day that goes by

58:33.031 --> 58:35.120
that I don't think about
lining up my daughter's friends

58:35.163 --> 58:38.036
one by one by one
and fucking 'em.

58:38.079 --> 58:41.518
Every time with my wife,
that's what I'm thinking about.

58:41.561 --> 58:43.520
I can't stop it.
I don't want to.

58:43.563 --> 58:46.087
Right now they're outside...

58:46.131 --> 58:47.959
having a pool party.

58:48.002 --> 58:49.613
And when I walk over,
and I wave,

58:49.656 --> 58:52.529
and I say,
"How's it going, girls?"

58:52.572 --> 58:54.574
they look at me like
I don't even have a dick.

58:54.618 --> 58:56.794
You didn't fly too close
to the sun, Walter.

58:56.837 --> 58:59.884
You flew through it.
Don't you see?

58:59.927 --> 59:03.452
You touched the hand of God,
and you're feeling guilty?

59:03.496 --> 59:05.324
Yes.

59:05.367 --> 59:06.586
I feel guilty.

59:06.630 --> 59:08.632
You shut your fucking mouth,

59:08.675 --> 59:10.416
and you get down on your knees

59:10.459 --> 59:12.244
and you thank whatever god
you want to.

59:12.287 --> 59:14.159
You can pick one because
they've all smiled on you.

59:14.202 --> 59:17.379
But whatever you do,
don't you spit in their faces.

59:17.423 --> 59:19.077
Yeah, it happened,

59:19.120 --> 59:20.557
and maybe you'd take it back
if you could,

59:20.600 --> 59:21.993
but don't make
your daughter miserable

59:22.036 --> 59:23.864
just because you had
the time of your life.

59:23.908 --> 59:25.866
- Hey, Karen's dad!
- Yes, Tina?

59:25.910 --> 59:27.607
How do you turn on the Jacuzzi?

59:27.651 --> 59:30.044
It's the last button
all the way to the left.

59:30.088 --> 59:31.132
- The little blue one.
- Jack?

59:31.176 --> 59:33.221
Okay, thank you.

59:33.265 --> 59:34.483
Hello?

59:34.527 --> 59:35.876
I gotta go.

59:35.920 --> 59:37.312
Okay, you be good.

59:37.356 --> 59:40.533
And whatever you do,
take a lot of pictures.

59:40.577 --> 59:41.578
Peace out.

59:51.979 --> 59:56.157
You are so pretty,
it's like actually disgusting.

59:56.201 --> 59:58.682
- Is that true?
- I can't look at your face.

59:58.725 --> 01:00:01.380
Stop.

01:00:01.423 --> 01:00:04.775
If it was me being this in love
like you and Nic are,

01:00:04.818 --> 01:00:06.472
I couldn't do a small wedding.

01:00:06.515 --> 01:00:08.909
I'd have to do
like a big wedding.

01:00:20.268 --> 01:00:21.966
Hey, sweetie.

01:00:22.009 --> 01:00:23.228
Hey.

01:00:28.363 --> 01:00:29.626
You okay?

01:00:31.062 --> 01:00:33.542
Kim told me.

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:43.378
I was just coming over here
to tell you.

01:00:43.422 --> 01:00:46.468
I get it. I get why
you would wait to tell me.

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:58.176
I've been wracking my brain,

01:00:58.219 --> 01:01:01.788
trying to figure out
the best way to tell you.

01:01:01.832 --> 01:01:03.268
It's just...

01:01:05.879 --> 01:01:07.446
I was drunk.

01:01:09.274 --> 01:01:12.146
It was just sex.
There was no emotion.

01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:14.235
I know how babies
are made, okay?

01:01:17.586 --> 01:01:20.502
It's like you're starting
another family or something.

01:01:20.546 --> 01:01:23.592
It's like ours wasn't
good enough for you, and...

01:01:23.636 --> 01:01:25.594
it's like your building
another one on top of it.

01:01:28.946 --> 01:01:31.296
Honey, you've got it wrong.

01:01:33.777 --> 01:01:36.867
Lucy...

01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:40.218
is not family to me
like you are.

01:01:43.569 --> 01:01:47.399
You know, I didn't want
to have any family here

01:01:47.442 --> 01:01:49.793
because of all the shit
with you guys.

01:01:49.836 --> 01:01:53.318
I thought it would be
bad vibes all around.

01:01:54.449 --> 01:01:56.016
But now that I'm here,

01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:58.323
and it's the day
that I'm getting married...

01:02:04.677 --> 01:02:07.245
I really wish
Mom was here too.

01:02:07.288 --> 01:02:09.203
I feel like I fucked
this whole thing up.

01:02:12.859 --> 01:02:16.123
You didn't mess anything up.

01:02:16.167 --> 01:02:17.603
If anything, I did.

01:02:17.646 --> 01:02:19.997
No. Actually, everyone
really likes you.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.347
You passed the Kim test.

01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:23.696
Hmm.

01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:29.267
You really love her, huh?

01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:30.790
Yeah.

01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:32.270
I do.

01:02:34.533 --> 01:02:37.275
Well, then there's no hurry.

01:02:37.318 --> 01:02:40.017
You don't have
to get married today.

01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:42.802
Six-person wedding,
it's pretty easy to reschedule.

01:02:42.846 --> 01:02:44.891
Dad, it's not fair
to give me cold feet.

01:02:44.935 --> 01:02:46.893
Sweetie.

01:02:46.937 --> 01:02:48.852
I know it's last-minute,
but, um...

01:02:48.895 --> 01:02:51.811
Moon's gonna play Autoharp
for the wedding,

01:02:51.855 --> 01:02:54.292
and I'd really love it
if you would sing with her.

01:02:54.335 --> 01:02:55.902
Oh, uh...

01:02:55.946 --> 01:02:58.513
You have to.
It's my wedding.

01:03:01.429 --> 01:03:03.780
What do you want me to sing?

01:03:07.609 --> 01:03:10.874
Hey, it's Lucy.
I don't call. Just text me.

01:03:10.917 --> 01:03:13.311
Hey.

01:03:13.354 --> 01:03:17.445
Listen, could you call me back?
It's pretty important.

01:03:17.489 --> 01:03:20.013
Okay? So, uh...

01:03:20.057 --> 01:03:22.450
So call me back.
All right, bye.

01:03:35.724 --> 01:03:39.206
Put a little bit of oomph
in your hair.

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:43.167
Hey, blushing bride to be.

01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:46.823
Girls, can I have
just minute with Kim?

01:03:46.866 --> 01:03:47.911
Sure, Walter.

01:03:49.303 --> 01:03:52.176
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:03:55.570 --> 01:03:57.877
Okay, I think I figured it out.

01:03:57.921 --> 01:04:00.271
You are not in a place
that this can work out.

01:04:00.314 --> 01:04:01.794
And you are not in a place
to tell me

01:04:01.838 --> 01:04:03.448
what kind of place
that I am in.

01:04:03.491 --> 01:04:04.884
You know I'm in position
to tell you.

01:04:04.928 --> 01:04:06.538
I am the most qualified guy
in the world

01:04:06.581 --> 01:04:07.931
when it comes
to fucking up relationships.

01:04:07.974 --> 01:04:09.758
That I'd say is true.

01:04:09.802 --> 01:04:11.760
You need to tell her the truth,
and you need to tell her now.

01:04:11.804 --> 01:04:13.545
Let her choose.

01:04:13.588 --> 01:04:16.026
If she chooses
to stay with you, great.

01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:18.289
If she doesn't, I'm sorry.

01:04:18.332 --> 01:04:21.031
But every minute that goes by
that you don't tell her,

01:04:21.074 --> 01:04:23.337
you're hurting her.

01:04:23.381 --> 01:04:25.339
I know you don't think
you have the ability

01:04:25.383 --> 01:04:27.298
to hurt someone with
something you're not doing,

01:04:27.341 --> 01:04:28.908
but believe me,
it's easier than you think.

01:04:28.952 --> 01:04:30.954
I can't.

01:04:30.997 --> 01:04:33.347
I can't.
It's too late. I...

01:04:35.306 --> 01:04:38.613
- Then go.
- Go?

01:04:38.657 --> 01:04:40.398
Where am I supposed to go?

01:04:40.441 --> 01:04:42.487
Anywhere. Just go.

01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:45.925
Please. Leave her.

01:04:47.666 --> 01:04:49.755
She deserves to be happy.

01:04:49.798 --> 01:04:51.975
Please, Kim, just go.

01:04:53.411 --> 01:04:55.065
Please.

01:04:55.108 --> 01:04:57.197
Hey, we gotta braid the
bride's hair for the wedding,

01:04:57.241 --> 01:04:58.764
so you gotta go.

01:05:02.724 --> 01:05:03.769
Bye, Walter.

01:05:06.511 --> 01:05:08.034
- You nervous?
- Yeah.

01:05:08.078 --> 01:05:11.255
Don't be nervous.
You look so pretty.

01:05:11.298 --> 01:05:14.127
Okay, so I'm just gonna pull
some of this back into a braid.
