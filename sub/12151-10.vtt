00:01.929 --> 00:03.469
Previously on Angel:

00:04.929 --> 00:07.000
His family, his children....

00:07.330 --> 00:10.630
It will be 200 years before you
can confront Angelus or Darla.

00:11.529 --> 00:12.900
I'm tired of waiting!

00:12.730 --> 00:15.050
I want your word
you will show no mercy.

00:15.730 --> 00:18.920
- Who's the pirate with a sword?
- He's not in the system.

00:19.329 --> 00:22.140
- This is impossible.
- Tell me about it, Daddy.

00:22.929 --> 00:25.030
This might be
that bad thing we expected.

00:25.329 --> 00:28.030
We need to dissect it
and find out what it means.

00:28.929 --> 00:31.250
- It's human.
- I'm gonna have a son.

00:31.329 --> 00:33.719
The prophet says
there will be no birth.

00:36.729 --> 00:39.750
She wants to have it here?
She can't have a baby here.

00:42.130 --> 00:45.429
This child, it's the one good thing
we ever did together.

00:46.329 --> 00:48.429
You make sure to tell him that.

00:55.329 --> 00:57.149
Now's your chance. Do it.

00:57.130 --> 00:58.920
Finish it while you still can.

00:59.530 --> 01:02.200
You can't just let him walk away!

01:03.130 --> 01:06.849
I swore that I would show no mercy.
And I won't.

01:10.329 --> 01:12.750
We'll need to make
some changes for safety.

01:13.329 --> 01:18.140
Covers for the outlets, kidproof
the locks on the weapons cabinet--

01:21.129 --> 01:24.500
Right after we gut and remodel
the entire hotel.

01:25.329 --> 01:26.379
Be careful.

01:26.530 --> 01:29.900
Whatever was in those cages
could still be loose.

01:37.930 --> 01:39.329
There's blood over here.

01:39.730 --> 01:41.980
Some bastard's blown
a hole in the lift.

01:42.129 --> 01:44.019
Sorry, my bastard.

01:44.530 --> 01:47.689
Oh. Well, not like we ever use it.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:58.329 --> 02:00.650
- Is that a welcome for a houseguest?
- Houseguest?

02:01.329 --> 02:04.420
I figured since you all
destroyed my club twice...

02:04.930 --> 02:07.950
...I wouldn't be imposing,
asking for a place to stay.

02:08.530 --> 02:13.030
Maybe I should reconsider a marginally
attractive Mulix demon's offer.

02:13.930 --> 02:16.740
If he, she or it has
suitable accommodations--

02:17.530 --> 02:21.430
Come on, hand over the little nipper.
Let Uncle Lorne take a gander.

02:21.729 --> 02:24.750
I'm sure everyone else
has already had their turn.

02:26.530 --> 02:29.370
Wow, I'm sensing a serious
mama-bear vibe.

02:29.530 --> 02:34.129
- We're all still waiting our turn.
- I get it, "Looky, don't touchy."

02:36.129 --> 02:39.849
- He's got a little scratchy.
- During the rush to leave the alley.

02:40.330 --> 02:42.860
Let me put some ointment on that.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.580
- Here.
- I got it, I got it.

02:48.729 --> 02:50.689
Easy. Right there.

02:51.129 --> 02:54.250
All right, let your arms out.

02:57.129 --> 02:59.449
Okay. Sh.

03:01.330 --> 03:04.069
- What did I do?
- You don't have a woman's touch.

03:06.129 --> 03:09.639
Whatever your taste in clothing
may indicate.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.800
- I don't wanna know.
- Could you throw it?

03:18.729 --> 03:20.169
- I guess. Why?
- There!

03:22.930 --> 03:24.509
Bogey at the back door!

03:34.930 --> 03:36.439
This isn't over, is it?

03:36.729 --> 03:39.849
No. Angel's son is part
of the prophecy.

03:40.330 --> 03:42.719
Everyone and everything
will come for him.

03:43.330 --> 03:45.500
Which means we need a plan.

03:46.330 --> 03:49.169
Think I figured it out.

03:51.129 --> 03:52.599
He wet himself.

04:46.850 --> 04:49.199
We could use your help.
When you finish--

04:49.250 --> 04:51.319
--changing the baby on my desk.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.899
Sorry, I needed the space.

04:54.050 --> 04:55.839
You nearly had sex
on my desk...

04:56.449 --> 04:59.430
...so I shouldn't be surprised
there's a baby on it.

05:00.050 --> 05:03.139
That was some guy
who switched bodies with me...

05:03.649 --> 05:07.060
...and can we keep the S-E-X talk
away from the baby?

05:07.850 --> 05:09.430
Do you need help?

05:10.250 --> 05:12.779
No, Wes, I know how
to change a diaper.

05:13.250 --> 05:16.829
A normal one, with pins.
It's these newfangled fasteners....

05:18.050 --> 05:22.649
Did you know these nappies are lined
with material designed for astronauts?

05:23.449 --> 05:24.529
That's interesting.

05:25.250 --> 05:28.480
Now I'm picturing men wearing
nappies, and I'm disturbed.

05:28.850 --> 05:31.589
Okay, little guy,
you're ready, aren't you?

05:33.649 --> 05:35.680
Great.
How's the list coming along?

05:36.649 --> 05:38.649
We divided it into two categories.

05:39.050 --> 05:41.649
One, those who we know pose
a threat to the baby.

05:42.649 --> 05:46.019
Holtz, Wolfram and Hart,
the vampire cult that attacked us.

05:46.850 --> 05:49.660
Two, those who could pose a threat
once they know of the baby.

05:49.850 --> 05:53.500
"Order of Phillius,
Beltar the Cremator. Frank"?

05:54.050 --> 05:56.079
Local mobster,
specializes in kidnapping.

05:56.449 --> 06:00.629
What? You can't be wet,
I just changed you.

06:01.850 --> 06:04.689
Are you hungry?
I got a bottle all ready for you.

06:04.850 --> 06:08.360
Where did I put his bottle?
I had his bottle ready for him.

06:11.449 --> 06:14.639
Okay. Here's your ba-ba.

06:15.649 --> 06:17.089
Take your ba-ba.

06:18.050 --> 06:20.889
You take it like this:
You drink and you're happy.

06:21.649 --> 06:25.199
Let me take him for a little while.
I helped raise my cousin.

06:25.850 --> 06:27.430
I can handle it.

06:28.850 --> 06:31.100
We have to erase
everyone on the list.

06:31.250 --> 06:32.720
- I can do that.
- Fred?

06:33.050 --> 06:34.279
What?

06:34.850 --> 06:38.990
You meant erase in a squish-and-kill,
violent kind of way.

06:40.250 --> 06:42.420
I'll just put that back.

06:43.250 --> 06:44.860
Come on, it's a nice ba-ba.

06:45.050 --> 06:48.670
You wanna stop crying and take
your ba-ba, yes you do. Please?

06:50.290 --> 06:52.680
That was thrilling.
Not like I waited for you...

06:53.290 --> 06:56.449
...to take vengeance on Angel,
just to have you let him go.

06:56.889 --> 06:58.779
Why didn't you tell me
Darla was pregnant?

06:59.290 --> 07:02.980
- You're supposed to kill them.
- She sacrificed herself.

07:03.490 --> 07:06.329
Darla did your job for you.
At least one is dust.

07:07.089 --> 07:09.899
Angel's demise will be
a great deal more painful.

07:10.089 --> 07:15.040
You use words like "death,"
"no mercy," but I haven't seen bupkes.

07:16.089 --> 07:18.720
Listen to me.
We've got prophecies to fulfill.

07:19.089 --> 07:21.620
We don't need some deep,
dark plan for Angel.

07:22.089 --> 07:24.860
You put a stake in him,
you watch him go poof.

07:25.689 --> 07:28.009
Step one is getting rid
of these minions.

07:28.689 --> 07:32.019
No, step one is poof,
and then there are no more steps.

07:32.290 --> 07:35.939
We can't get rid of the grapplers.
I signed a two-week contract.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.209
You don't wanna piss them off.

07:38.889 --> 07:41.519
They're soulless beasts,
bred to maim and kill.

07:42.490 --> 07:45.399
Maim and kill.
Two more words I like.

07:45.490 --> 07:48.019
You'll need them,
unless your painful plan is...

07:49.089 --> 07:52.459
...to kill Angel with candy clowns
and marshmallow pies.

07:56.290 --> 07:57.759
What's happening?

07:58.689 --> 08:02.339
- I need more than fighters.
- They're choking! Know the Heimlich?

08:02.889 --> 08:06.439
I can't do it in this dimension,
my arms will go through them.

08:07.089 --> 08:08.600
What did you do?

08:08.889 --> 08:10.959
- I poisoned their drink.
- Why?

08:11.290 --> 08:14.870
I don't need mercenaries
who kill for anyone willing to pay.

08:15.490 --> 08:18.089
I need warriors who will die
for my cause.

08:23.290 --> 08:24.829
Like that.

08:25.689 --> 08:30.149
Great. So step one is, I'm stuck
with four costly and dead demons.

08:31.089 --> 08:32.389
What's step two?

08:32.889 --> 08:35.629
We can find information
using this box.

08:37.090 --> 08:38.389
- Correct?
- Yeah.

08:38.889 --> 08:41.379
You won't believe how fast
my connection is.

08:41.289 --> 08:43.460
- What do you want to find?
- Obituaries.

08:44.370 --> 08:46.090
What about the ninja guy?

08:46.769 --> 08:50.029
- The vampire cult killed him.
- There could be more.

08:50.370 --> 08:51.909
The world is a sick place.

08:52.169 --> 08:55.679
There are already three websites
offering money for the baby.

08:56.370 --> 08:59.000
- Fred, help her trace the websites.
- Right.

08:59.370 --> 09:01.440
It's good. Try it, you'll like it.

09:02.370 --> 09:04.019
So good.

09:10.169 --> 09:11.250
See?

09:12.570 --> 09:16.399
Teddy likes it, and I like it too.

09:20.370 --> 09:21.419
See?

09:30.570 --> 09:31.830
What was that?

09:32.370 --> 09:34.440
Listening to those furies
gives me whiplash.

09:34.769 --> 09:37.159
Thank God they left.
My head was about to pop off.

09:37.769 --> 09:41.320
- Granted, not a big deal.
- That was their spell kicking in?

09:41.970 --> 09:45.690
They put a force field over the hotel.
Nothing can get in or out.

09:46.169 --> 09:48.590
So the baby's safe?
We're all safe, right?

09:49.169 --> 09:52.720
Unless one of those killers
throws a firebomb in at us...

09:53.370 --> 09:57.620
...like they did at your club, which
had a similar safety spell around it.

09:59.370 --> 10:01.860
- Sorry.
- She's right. He won't be safe here.

10:02.370 --> 10:05.950
We can get out. I installed
an emergency exit in the sewers.

10:06.570 --> 10:09.129
A mystical barrier opens
with a password.

10:09.570 --> 10:13.190
- Pylean word for "hedgehog."
- Oh. Oh!

10:13.769 --> 10:15.840
It means something
different in English?

10:16.169 --> 10:19.009
We'll have to use it.
The baby needs to see a doctor.

10:19.769 --> 10:21.840
What? He's not sick.

10:22.169 --> 10:25.470
- Does he look sick?
- No, but he needs his newborn checkup.

10:26.370 --> 10:30.159
The baby book says that he's supposed
to have a vitamin K shot...

10:30.570 --> 10:34.500
...and a PKU test after he's born.
Are you gonna circumcise?

10:38.370 --> 10:39.559
I think he heard you.

10:39.570 --> 10:43.190
Are there fluorescent lights in here?
I keep hearing this hum.

10:43.769 --> 10:47.909
Plus, fluorescents, green light,
green skin, it's all bad.

10:49.769 --> 10:53.529
I'll take the blank stares
as a big, fat no.

10:53.970 --> 10:54.980
- Gunn?
- Yeah?

10:55.769 --> 10:57.309
I'm in a war,
I'll need serious firepower.

10:57.570 --> 10:59.500
- Beyond swords and spears?
- Way beyond.

10:59.970 --> 11:01.580
- Leave it to me.
- Thanks.

11:01.769 --> 11:04.539
- We getting to the websites?
- Not yet.

11:05.370 --> 11:08.740
Normally, we'd hack into the e-mail
and trace the relays.

11:08.970 --> 11:11.710
- But they're using remailers.
- Which means?

11:12.570 --> 11:14.850
There's no direct I.D.
It'll take time.

11:14.970 --> 11:17.039
We don't have it.
Are those all the names?

11:17.970 --> 11:21.159
Working on other leads.
We're all doing the best we can.

11:21.570 --> 11:22.940
- Do better.
- Angel.

11:23.370 --> 11:24.629
I promised his mother.

11:24.570 --> 11:27.730
No one is gonna put their hands
on this child.

11:29.370 --> 11:30.700
No one.

11:32.409 --> 11:35.600
"No one is going to put
their hands on this child."

11:36.009 --> 11:37.759
Is this meant to be ironic?

11:38.409 --> 11:42.909
According to our highly, and I'm now
thinking overpaid, translators...

11:43.809 --> 11:48.340
...the Nyazian scroll said the child
would never be born, yet here he is.

11:49.210 --> 11:51.840
A technicality.
Darla died during childbirth.

11:52.210 --> 11:53.960
Dusted during childbirth.

11:54.610 --> 11:56.500
Our sources say she staked herself...

11:57.009 --> 12:00.240
...leaving the baby alive
but never actually born.

12:00.610 --> 12:04.539
Macduff was from his mother's womb.
Untimely ripped.

12:05.409 --> 12:06.669
Clever loophole.

12:06.610 --> 12:10.259
We could use those scroll writers
in Contracts and Negotiations.

12:11.409 --> 12:13.480
We have to get that baby.

12:13.809 --> 12:16.019
He has a knack
for stating the obvious.

12:16.210 --> 12:19.299
I have a tactical team working
on intercept scenarios.

12:19.809 --> 12:22.409
Lilah would have thought of that,
given time.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.440
Moving on, children.

12:25.809 --> 12:28.409
I want everything there is
on this character.

12:29.409 --> 12:31.899
He slaughtered some
of our best-trained men.

12:32.409 --> 12:35.009
- He's gonna be a problem.
- We're locating him.

12:35.409 --> 12:38.179
Preferably before he locates us.

12:39.009 --> 12:42.100
Now, that's a cute little baby.
Yes, you are.

12:42.610 --> 12:45.419
And your daddy is a vampire
with a soul.

12:46.210 --> 12:49.330
And sometimes he reverts
to a creature of pure evil...

12:49.809 --> 12:52.019
...who could rip your tiny throat out.

12:52.210 --> 12:53.960
Yes, he does.

12:57.009 --> 13:01.720
I like kids. The senior partners took
mine before I really got to know them.

13:02.409 --> 13:03.669
Turn it up.

13:06.610 --> 13:07.940
Turn it down.

13:09.610 --> 13:11.049
Teddy isn't crying.

13:12.610 --> 13:14.009
Do you see Teddy crying?

13:13.809 --> 13:18.159
Teddy isn't crying. Do you see
Teddy crying? No, he's not crying.

13:22.809 --> 13:25.409
Come on, kid, you gotta
give me something here.

13:25.809 --> 13:28.340
All right, last-ditch effort.

13:56.409 --> 13:58.509
Here, let me give it a try, huh?

14:25.210 --> 14:27.419
He doesn't like Smokey Robinson
and the Miracles?

14:28.210 --> 14:30.460
- You said he had a soul.
- You know what?

14:30.610 --> 14:33.700
You're fed. You're changed.
I hold you, you cry.

14:34.210 --> 14:37.299
I put you down, you cry.
What do you want me to do?

14:39.610 --> 14:43.440
I'm a terrible father.
I can't even get him to stop crying.

14:46.210 --> 14:49.090
It's getting a little tense.
Your vibe, that is.

14:49.809 --> 14:50.889
My vibe? What vibe?

14:51.009 --> 14:54.629
The anxious one that's been
coming off you since he was born.

14:55.809 --> 14:57.250
He's connected to you.

14:57.610 --> 14:59.860
If you're wound tight,
how do you think he feels?

15:00.009 --> 15:03.340
He's not a day old, and he's got an
enemies list. Wouldn't you be edgy?

15:04.210 --> 15:06.809
Yeah. I'd also be in awe.

15:07.210 --> 15:08.750
Look at him.

15:13.210 --> 15:15.139
He's more than a mission, bro.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.009
Look at him.

15:18.009 --> 15:19.659
Look at him.

15:30.610 --> 15:32.929
Okay, it's all right.

15:37.210 --> 15:39.740
Hey, it's gonna be all right.

15:40.210 --> 15:42.240
It's gonna be all right.

15:44.409 --> 15:46.090
Hey. Sh.

15:54.610 --> 15:55.840
Do you like that?

15:55.809 --> 15:58.440
No, obviously.
Okay, how about this one?

16:07.210 --> 16:08.610
Okay.

16:09.009 --> 16:11.539
I only got one more.

16:28.809 --> 16:33.620
That's my little guy.

16:34.809 --> 16:36.879
You like that, don't you?

16:47.049 --> 16:50.809
Lilah Morgan, clearance 0112773.

16:52.450 --> 16:54.549
There we are.
What can I do for you?

16:54.850 --> 16:57.450
I want everything the firm
has on Angel.

16:57.850 --> 17:01.039
His life history, unlife history,
intercept records...

17:02.049 --> 17:03.629
...victim lists, everything.

17:03.850 --> 17:07.750
I'm looking for someone he crossed
paths with 100 years ago or more.

17:08.650 --> 17:12.759
And make it fast. The boys upstairs
are at Defcon, like, 1000.

17:13.450 --> 17:16.190
Sure thing, Miss Morgan.
Just a sec.

17:20.650 --> 17:21.910
Everything's in there?

17:22.450 --> 17:25.400
Down to the baby that wasn't
supposed to be born.

17:26.049 --> 17:27.910
How do you know about that?

17:28.450 --> 17:31.470
I'm Files and Records, it's my job.

17:32.049 --> 17:34.609
Great. I'll be back when I--

17:35.049 --> 17:37.890
Miss Morgan? There aren't
any documents in there.

17:38.650 --> 17:41.180
That's just a reference key
to the full file.

17:41.650 --> 17:42.880
The reference key.

17:42.849 --> 17:45.240
So where is the full file?

17:50.049 --> 17:54.089
The key helps locate which section
of the file you'd like to look at.

17:54.849 --> 17:57.130
That whole thing is Angel's file?

17:57.250 --> 17:59.779
Just the first 35 cabinets.

18:00.849 --> 18:01.759
Right.

18:03.849 --> 18:05.809
Does China Palace deliver here?

19:02.650 --> 19:05.279
You'd punch quicker
without so much to drink.

19:06.250 --> 19:10.920
It's a tradeoff. Because without that
much to drink, it hurts a lot more.

19:18.849 --> 19:22.400
- You stick to the shadows.
- I'm not much of a day person.

19:23.650 --> 19:26.140
- I'm not here to fight.
- Your bad luck.

19:32.650 --> 19:36.900
I know you're in pain.
I know what it's like to grieve.

19:41.650 --> 19:45.410
Nice goatee. Kind of rounds out
the whole creepy stalker look.

19:46.450 --> 19:48.450
I'll be moving on now.

19:49.450 --> 19:50.779
Justine.

19:51.849 --> 19:53.500
I'm not finished.

19:54.250 --> 19:56.779
- How do you know my name?
- I know everything.

19:57.250 --> 20:01.779
You live at 7221 Spaulding.
You stay out all night, sleep all day.

20:03.250 --> 20:06.730
Ever since your sister
was murdered six months ago.

20:07.450 --> 20:08.680
Your twin.

20:10.450 --> 20:13.259
It wasn't a mugging
like the papers said, was it?

20:14.049 --> 20:15.559
Major blood loss.

20:15.849 --> 20:18.450
Two unidentifiable neck wounds.

20:18.849 --> 20:20.009
So?

20:20.650 --> 20:23.740
My name's Holtz.
I want to help you.

20:24.849 --> 20:26.710
I'll tell you what I want.

20:27.849 --> 20:31.109
I want you to stay the hell
away from me.

20:44.970 --> 20:46.160
Thanks.

20:48.569 --> 20:51.480
We still haven't traced the websites.

20:52.170 --> 20:53.400
Relax.

20:57.569 --> 20:58.650
Get any sleep?

20:58.769 --> 21:01.369
No, I was up all night watching him.

21:02.369 --> 21:04.259
If you let us take shifts, we--

21:04.170 --> 21:07.259
No, I wasn't watching him
like that, I was....

21:07.769 --> 21:09.660
I was just...

21:11.369 --> 21:12.599
...watching him.

21:16.769 --> 21:19.230
He looks a bit like me,
don't you think?

21:19.769 --> 21:23.460
Oh, yeah. Look at that brow.
He's a miniature you.

21:24.569 --> 21:26.849
Hand him over
and catch some shuteye.

21:27.569 --> 21:30.269
I'll sleep when I know he's safe.

21:31.170 --> 21:33.799
Which will be when?
Around never?

21:35.369 --> 21:39.549
Angel, I understand
you want to protect him.

21:40.170 --> 21:43.470
But you gotta let go a little,
share the responsibility.

21:43.769 --> 21:47.140
- You can't be everything for him.
- I'm his only family.

21:47.970 --> 21:50.180
My job now is to be
everything for him.

21:50.970 --> 21:53.599
Really? Okay.

21:54.569 --> 21:55.829
Follow me.

21:56.970 --> 21:58.130
Come on.

22:04.170 --> 22:06.170
- Where are we going?
- Come on.

22:07.769 --> 22:09.170
Cordelia, wait.

22:09.569 --> 22:11.250
We're going outside.

22:11.369 --> 22:13.759
Where your son's gonna
want to go play.

22:14.369 --> 22:18.720
Where you'll have to rush him
to the hospital, but I see your point.

22:19.769 --> 22:24.369
You can't go outside in the day like
other parents, because you're a vampire.

22:25.170 --> 22:29.000
And even if you weren't,
you can't do everything for him.

22:32.970 --> 22:35.740
If he has to get
to the hospital at noon...

22:36.569 --> 22:40.049
...on the sunniest day of the year,
he'll get there.

22:40.769 --> 22:42.519
Even if I don't.

22:42.569 --> 22:43.869
Angel.

22:44.970 --> 22:46.859
Stop. Angel!

22:49.170 --> 22:50.819
Good morning, all.

22:50.970 --> 22:55.220
Is that bacon I smell, or did somebody
fall asleep with the curtains up?

22:55.769 --> 22:58.819
Gotta figure, a guy like you,
a place like this...

22:59.970 --> 23:03.519
...the only truly safe room
would be the janitor's closet.

23:04.170 --> 23:05.250
Thanks for the tip.

23:05.369 --> 23:07.720
Could you sleep,
or did you hear humming?

23:08.369 --> 23:10.900
I put some earplugs in
and slept like a baby.

23:11.369 --> 23:13.970
Cried and wet the bed all night.

23:14.970 --> 23:17.390
- Tough room.
- Mission accomplished.

23:18.569 --> 23:21.130
You said you wanted firepower so:

23:23.369 --> 23:25.509
- Good work.
- We got company out front.

23:25.769 --> 23:28.579
- They see you?
- No. I doubled back through the sewer.

23:28.769 --> 23:31.819
- Who are they?
- Two cars of the vampire cult...

23:32.970 --> 23:35.319
- ...and a biker gang I recognize.
- Humans?

23:35.369 --> 23:36.980
Into extortion and kidnapping.

23:37.769 --> 23:40.720
There's some fellows in a van
wearing hooded cloaks.

23:40.769 --> 23:42.420
Lilliad demons.

23:43.170 --> 23:47.420
They make a magical broth from the
bones of human children. Two L's.

23:48.569 --> 23:52.710
They probably want to find out how
a vampire's child affects the recipe.

23:53.369 --> 23:57.200
They use strong magic. They may
be able to break the furies' spell.

23:57.569 --> 24:01.400
- What are they waiting for?
- Their power links to the lunar cycle.

24:02.369 --> 24:04.619
We're safe now,
but when the moon rises...?

24:04.769 --> 24:06.099
Tonight's a full moon.

24:06.569 --> 24:10.569
We won't be able to fight off the
world once that force field is down.

24:11.369 --> 24:14.000
I don't see that we have a choice.

24:16.769 --> 24:17.779
This is impossible.

24:20.049 --> 24:23.490
Two hundred and seventy-five years
of the most inane....

24:26.650 --> 24:30.200
What kind of wussy name
is Liam, anyway?

24:32.049 --> 24:33.559
Okay, you're at the hotel.

24:33.849 --> 24:37.259
The pirate's about to kill Angel,
Angel calls him....

24:37.450 --> 24:39.799
What? What was it?

24:42.250 --> 24:43.440
Hose.

24:43.450 --> 24:45.339
- Hope.
- Holtz?

24:45.849 --> 24:46.720
What?

24:47.049 --> 24:49.509
Holtz, Daniel, vampire killer,
circa 1754.

24:50.049 --> 24:53.980
Hunted Angel and Darla until
his mysterious disappearance in 1773.

24:54.849 --> 24:58.680
Larson McMillan, Vampiricus
Conquestus, page 412.

24:59.650 --> 25:02.839
- How did you--?
- I'm Files and Records, it's my job.

25:03.250 --> 25:07.390
You mean, I've been sitting here
for the last 14 hours...

25:09.250 --> 25:11.920
...to find that you know
everything in this case file.

25:12.250 --> 25:15.369
No, Miss Morgan.
I know everything in every case file.

25:16.450 --> 25:20.170
- I'm Files and Records, it's my--
- Your job. Unbelievable.

25:20.650 --> 25:23.559
What's the skinny on Holtz?
Why the hate for Angel?

25:24.250 --> 25:25.650
Just a moment.

25:26.650 --> 25:30.019
1764, Angel and Darla kill
Holtz, Caroline; Holtz, Sarah...

25:30.849 --> 25:32.740
...and Holtz, Daniel, infant son.

25:33.250 --> 25:35.950
Massacred his family, that'd do it.

25:36.849 --> 25:39.519
Holtz vows to avenge their blood,
May 1764.

25:39.849 --> 25:42.519
Pursues Angel and Darla
for nine years...

25:42.849 --> 25:45.869
...incidentally killing 378 vampires
in the meantime.

25:46.450 --> 25:50.589
We're dealing with a single-minded
vengeance machine with bloodlust.

25:51.250 --> 25:53.950
That's just awesome.

26:06.250 --> 26:09.579
- What in the hell are you doing here?
- Watching you fight.

26:30.250 --> 26:32.809
- Why'd you wait?
- To see if you could win.

26:33.250 --> 26:36.440
I would have kicked his ass
if you hadn't distracted me.

26:37.450 --> 26:39.700
- I wasn't your problem.
- Really?

26:39.849 --> 26:42.900
You fight wild.
Your passion works against you.

26:43.450 --> 26:46.470
- You'll teach me about passion?
- I'll teach you how to fight.

26:47.049 --> 26:50.099
- What's in it for you?
- You help me kill a vampire.

26:50.650 --> 26:53.490
- You don't need me for that.
- I do.

26:54.250 --> 26:56.460
This vampire is strong.

26:56.650 --> 27:00.720
Are we talking about some kind of
Karate Kid, Mr. Miyagi groove thing?

27:01.450 --> 27:03.029
Wax on, wax off.

27:03.849 --> 27:07.079
You'll find references to modern
culture are lost on me.

27:07.450 --> 27:08.750
What a shocker.

27:09.250 --> 27:12.339
But I know you're interested
in more than the trivial.

27:12.849 --> 27:15.480
Your life has been ruined.
You can't sleep.

27:16.450 --> 27:20.420
Instead, you make others pay
for what happened to your sister.

27:21.250 --> 27:23.250
That's where I can help.

27:23.650 --> 27:26.980
I see your talent, and I see your hate.

27:27.849 --> 27:32.170
And I know that I can shape and hone
you into an instrument of vengeance.

27:34.450 --> 27:36.029
Sounds like fun.

27:37.450 --> 27:39.130
It won't be.

28:10.250 --> 28:14.599
Guys, the Lilliad demons are starting
their mojo on the force field.

28:21.049 --> 28:23.680
All right, sun's down.
Vamps can come out too.

28:24.650 --> 28:27.950
- They're headed toward the bikers.
- What are they doing?

28:30.049 --> 28:32.299
Having a brawl
over who kills us first.

28:33.049 --> 28:34.980
- We must hold our ground.
- If we can't?

28:35.450 --> 28:37.130
Fall back towards the cellar.

28:37.849 --> 28:39.809
We can retreat through the sewer.

28:40.250 --> 28:42.569
- This won't work.
- It's primed and ready.

28:42.650 --> 28:44.089
Not the weapon, the plan.

28:44.450 --> 28:46.029
I'm glad someone said that.

28:46.849 --> 28:50.009
Sitting here waiting to die
never was much of a plan.

28:50.450 --> 28:51.359
Sorry.

28:51.650 --> 28:54.559
So, what genius idea you got
hidden up your sleeve?

28:55.250 --> 28:57.849
- Plan is, I take the baby.
- What?

28:58.250 --> 29:00.279
He was born in a siege,
he won't die in one.

29:00.650 --> 29:03.390
Not if you stay and help fight.
We're in a war.

29:03.650 --> 29:06.319
- I'm in a retreat.
- What about taking them out?

29:07.250 --> 29:10.869
There's too many of them.
I can get out through the sewers.

29:11.450 --> 29:14.539
- You're just gonna run away?
- It's what he's good at.

29:15.049 --> 29:18.309
You don't want to fire us
before you leave us to fight?

29:18.650 --> 29:21.210
We already established this
as a bad idea.

29:22.250 --> 29:23.369
You'll be all right.

29:23.450 --> 29:27.240
Once they realize that the baby's
gone, they'll go after me.

29:27.650 --> 29:29.970
Wesley, stall them if you can.

29:31.849 --> 29:34.799
Tripping over our
dead bodies will slow them down.

29:35.450 --> 29:38.640
You really didn't hear anything
I said earlier, did you?

29:39.650 --> 29:41.089
I heard you.

29:43.849 --> 29:45.990
Angel? Don't leave us.

29:58.849 --> 30:00.390
He's running away.

30:01.250 --> 30:02.690
He's sneaking away.

30:03.049 --> 30:06.140
And giving us a chance
to get the jump on everyone.

30:07.250 --> 30:09.349
- Alpha Team, he's in the sewers.
- Copy,

30:09.650 --> 30:11.859
Today, the world is different.

30:12.049 --> 30:15.029
A vampire has sacrificed herself
for her baby.

30:15.650 --> 30:19.160
- Know what that means?
- Something's good about the kid?

30:19.849 --> 30:25.049
This child could grow up and hunt
each and every one of us down.

30:26.450 --> 30:28.549
- Let's not let that happen.
- No, sir.

30:28.849 --> 30:32.150
- We'll find the baby, dead or alive.
- Are you crazy?

30:33.049 --> 30:35.299
Worried we'll hurt
the itty-bitty baby?

30:35.450 --> 30:38.640
I'm afraid you'll kill him
before we can cut him open...

30:39.650 --> 30:43.480
...while he's alive and find out
how he's alive in the first place.

30:54.970 --> 30:58.759
- Alpha Team, where are you?
- We're here,

31:23.170 --> 31:24.250
What are you doing?

31:24.369 --> 31:27.319
Imagining myself as John Wayne
in Rio Bravo. You?

31:27.970 --> 31:31.380
Austin Stoker, Assault on Precinct 13,

31:32.769 --> 31:36.490
If we live through this, trade in
the DVD players and get a life.

32:05.769 --> 32:06.960
Got him.

32:10.569 --> 32:12.319
I have a visual. Let's go.

32:12.369 --> 32:15.420
Alpha Team,
we're in pursuit, tracking northbound,

32:24.970 --> 32:26.299
Where's the child?

32:26.769 --> 32:29.299
Upstairs, Room 312.
Why don't you go get him?

32:29.769 --> 32:32.049
Wait, I have a better idea.

32:48.369 --> 32:51.809
Master, it's a trick.
He's taken the child.

33:15.970 --> 33:18.180
Now they're all after him.

33:18.369 --> 33:21.039
- I hope we stalled them long enough.
- Whatever.

33:21.970 --> 33:24.220
Running away was his call.

34:01.450 --> 34:06.089
We'll get through this. Vampire demon
biker posse, that's the easy part.

34:09.849 --> 34:12.800
The part that scares me
are all the questions:

34:13.449 --> 34:16.329
Why is the sky blue?
Why do people get sick?

34:17.050 --> 34:19.650
Why is there always pig's blood
in the fridge?

34:20.050 --> 34:23.380
I don't have all the answers.
Well, I do to that last one.

34:30.849 --> 34:31.929
Here we go.

34:33.250 --> 34:34.579
He's braking left.

35:10.449 --> 35:11.530
Could be worse.

35:11.650 --> 35:13.329
At least you're not crying.

35:19.449 --> 35:20.750
Give us the baby.

35:21.250 --> 35:22.480
You want the baby?

35:24.250 --> 35:26.000
You can have the baby!

35:26.650 --> 35:27.880
Grab the baby!

35:40.449 --> 35:42.030
- What is it?
- It's a--

35:56.650 --> 36:00.199
Sorry for the wait. Let's go.

36:09.849 --> 36:13.289
Good morning, all.

36:14.050 --> 36:17.699
Is that bacon I smell, or did somebody
fall asleep with the curtains up?

36:18.849 --> 36:21.239
Gotta figure, a guy like you,
a place like this--

36:21.250 --> 36:22.510
Back it up.

36:25.449 --> 36:27.769
--fall asleep with the curtains up?

36:27.849 --> 36:30.380
Gotta figure, a guy like you,
a place like--

36:30.849 --> 36:32.360
Stop it right there.

36:33.250 --> 36:34.969
Magnify 100 times.

36:36.849 --> 36:38.039
Again.

36:39.849 --> 36:43.150
There.
That's where he gives Angel the note.

36:44.650 --> 36:47.349
--the only truly safe room
would be the janitor's closet.

36:47.650 --> 36:48.730
Thanks for the tip,

36:48.849 --> 36:52.260
And tells him to read it
where we don't have surveillance.

36:53.050 --> 36:56.769
That green houseguest could hear
your transmit frequency.

36:57.250 --> 37:01.150
That Sturm und Drang about Angel
running out on them, a performance.

37:02.050 --> 37:04.400
Who knew Angel had the acting chops?

37:05.050 --> 37:07.539
Are you kidding?
It was one-note. Forced.

37:08.050 --> 37:10.789
- Funny, you bought it at the time.
- It worked.

37:11.050 --> 37:12.099
For us.

37:12.849 --> 37:16.639
Angel's little trick thinned the herd.
Any word about Holtz?

37:17.050 --> 37:19.679
No reports that he was among
Angel's pursuers.

37:20.050 --> 37:22.440
I hoped he would
be among the casualties.

37:23.050 --> 37:26.489
- What do we know about him?
- He's a vampire hunter.

37:27.250 --> 37:30.619
Angel killed his family.
He spent his life seeking revenge.

37:31.449 --> 37:34.639
And one more thing,
this all happened 200 years ago.

37:35.050 --> 37:37.440
- I thought Holtz was human.
- He is.

37:38.650 --> 37:39.699
A time traveler.

37:40.449 --> 37:42.769
The Nyazian scrolls
foretold his arrival.

37:42.849 --> 37:45.659
- He's a player.
- Yes, he's a cog in the machine.

37:46.449 --> 37:48.269
And aren't we all?

37:49.449 --> 37:51.059
What do you think he wants?

37:51.250 --> 37:54.940
Other than to tear out Angel's heart
and wear it as a brooch?

37:56.050 --> 37:59.420
We need information.
How he got here, who he works with.

37:59.650 --> 38:03.230
It's only a matter of time before
our needs and his come into conflict.

38:05.650 --> 38:07.610
Maybe sooner than we think.

38:11.050 --> 38:14.840
My son's got a tiny scratch
on his cheek, and now so do you.

38:15.250 --> 38:19.110
I'm holding you responsible
for anything that happens to him.

38:20.050 --> 38:22.150
A cold, a sunburn, a scratched knee.

38:22.449 --> 38:25.570
Whatever happens to him,
happens to you, and then some.

38:26.650 --> 38:28.719
Not only are you not coming
after him...

38:29.650 --> 38:32.349
...you'll make sure he lives
a long, healthy life.

38:32.650 --> 38:35.000
You just became his godfather.
Understand?

38:36.250 --> 38:37.510
- Sir?
- I believe I do.

38:38.050 --> 38:39.590
It's all right.

38:41.650 --> 38:44.070
One more thing, college fund.

38:44.650 --> 38:48.199
Start saving.
I got my heart set on Notre Dame.

38:57.610 --> 39:00.349
I'm happy to report
you have a healthy baby boy.

39:01.210 --> 39:03.769
- Great, but I'm not the mother.
- I apologize.

39:04.210 --> 39:05.079
That's okay.

39:05.409 --> 39:07.730
- I'm happy to report you--
- Me neither.

39:07.809 --> 39:10.340
The mother is no longer
in the picture.

39:10.809 --> 39:11.789
I see.

39:12.610 --> 39:16.090
Well, his height and weight
are in the 90th percentile...

39:16.210 --> 39:20.139
...we gave him his vitamin K and
his PKU, and he's doing very well.

39:21.010 --> 39:24.590
We don't seem to have his--
What's his name?

39:26.409 --> 39:27.599
Connor.

39:29.409 --> 39:31.730
- His name is Connor.
- Connor.

39:32.409 --> 39:35.250
Thank you, Mr. Angel.

39:37.210 --> 39:39.139
And congratulations.

39:40.210 --> 39:41.820
- Thanks.
- Sure.

39:42.610 --> 39:44.150
Hey. Hey.

39:45.610 --> 39:48.139
- Mr. Angel?
- Your first name's Geraldo.

39:48.610 --> 39:51.170
- We had to tell them something.
- Geraldo Angel.

39:52.210 --> 39:55.719
You're a pet psychiatrist
with a small practice in Pacoima...

39:55.809 --> 39:57.420
...and you fight crime.

39:58.210 --> 40:01.929
We just told them the name part.
The rest is me having fun.

40:02.409 --> 40:03.849
I don't know what to say.

40:04.210 --> 40:07.969
How about, "Thanks, I appreciate it,
you guys rock, way to go"?

40:09.010 --> 40:10.340
What she said.

40:14.409 --> 40:17.110
Got the best one a very small amount
of money could buy.

40:17.409 --> 40:18.710
Oh....

40:19.210 --> 40:22.230
Connor, you wanna go for a ride?

40:22.809 --> 40:27.550
- Oh, goodness.
- Connor. That's a lovely name.

40:28.210 --> 40:29.469
I don't suppose you ever
considered Wes--?

40:30.010 --> 40:31.380
No.

40:33.010 --> 40:36.559
Not to be negative or anything,
but we're okay, right?

40:37.210 --> 40:39.949
Nobody else is coming
after Connor or us?

40:40.809 --> 40:43.480
No, we're safe for the time being.

40:45.010 --> 40:46.409
Let's go home.

40:47.409 --> 40:49.409
- Nice stroller.
- Thank you.
