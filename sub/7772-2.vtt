00:12.267 --> 00:15.000
- Which of these shapes
is a parallelogram?

00:15.100 --> 00:16.900
- That one.
- Nope.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.333
Can you take your shades
off please?

00:18.433 --> 00:20.667
- Yeah, if you take
your top off.

00:20.767 --> 00:23.067
- I'm not taking my top off.
Take off your sunglasses.

00:23.167 --> 00:24.733
- Doesn't seem fair, but...

00:24.833 --> 00:26.133
Frickin' crazy.

00:26.233 --> 00:28.133
- Which of these women
is Harriet Tubman?

00:31.667 --> 00:33.267
- I don't--which one
is sexy to you?

00:35.333 --> 00:38.800
- Nope, that's Nancy Reagan.
First Lady.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.467
- America.

00:41.567 --> 00:43.167
Speaking of geography,

00:43.267 --> 00:44.667
which of these--

00:44.767 --> 00:46.500
Neither one of them.

00:46.600 --> 00:49.633
Let's get some beers
up in here's--Joy!

00:49.733 --> 00:51.900
Joy!

00:53.167 --> 00:54.767
Gene.

00:54.867 --> 00:57.333
- If you don't learn,
you don't pass your GED.

00:57.433 --> 00:59.733
You don't pass your GED,
you go to prison.

00:59.833 --> 01:02.400
Know what happens to girls
like you in prison?

01:02.500 --> 01:03.567
- Yeah, I get along
with everyone

01:03.667 --> 01:04.733
and have a super cool time,

01:04.833 --> 01:06.167
and then I get
corn-rowed-haired.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.633
- Nope, you get your teeth
knocked out

01:07.733 --> 01:09.433
with a shower handle
and they use your mouth

01:09.533 --> 01:11.633
as a tampon depository.

01:11.733 --> 01:13.433
Soup's on.

01:13.533 --> 01:16.433
Now which of these countries
is Botswana?

01:16.533 --> 01:18.100
- Sorry about that.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.400
- Okay. It's fine.

01:20.500 --> 01:22.567
- Which one of these--they're
both a country...

01:24.367 --> 01:25.767
- In Africa.

01:25.867 --> 01:29.233
- I think like maybe like
that one's Botswana?

01:29.333 --> 01:31.067
- Okay. All right.
I'll get it.

01:31.167 --> 01:32.567
- Oh, no, no, I got it.
- It's expensive card stock.

01:32.667 --> 01:33.867
- I got it.
I'll pick it up.

01:33.967 --> 01:35.267
- Don't.
Don't!

01:35.367 --> 01:36.633
- It's mine!
- Don't touch it.

01:36.733 --> 01:37.800
- Don't kick it with
your dirty sneakers.

01:37.900 --> 01:38.967
- Do they play soccer
in Botswana?

01:39.067 --> 01:40.100
- Don't!
Give it!

01:40.200 --> 01:41.867
Don't you--don't!

01:41.967 --> 01:45.533
You're eating Malaysia.

01:45.633 --> 01:47.067
- Tastes like Thailand.

01:47.167 --> 01:48.800
- * We're too gangsta for TV

01:48.900 --> 01:50.733
* That's why
you don't see us *

01:50.833 --> 01:52.400
* But they still
wanna be us *

01:52.500 --> 01:54.767
Ha ha!

02:00.267 --> 02:02.067
- I wonder if anyone's
ever died

02:02.133 --> 02:03.633
dying these tennis balls
their classic

02:03.733 --> 02:05.433
neon green color.

02:05.533 --> 02:07.200
- That's how I wanna go,
you know?

02:07.300 --> 02:09.067
Like, doing something
hella weird

02:09.167 --> 02:11.067
slash sports related.

02:11.133 --> 02:12.700
- I want to go
in a fire tragedy.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.833
- Speaking of, I need
your help.

02:15.933 --> 02:17.067
We need to get Billie fired.

02:17.100 --> 02:19.067
I mean, why, and--

02:20.300 --> 02:22.500
- But, I thought you
liked her.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.400
- No, she's like,
freakin' lame.

02:25.500 --> 02:27.833
With, like, a capital "F"
and a lowercase "L,"

02:27.933 --> 02:29.067
'cause you only capitalize,
like,

02:29.100 --> 02:30.567
the first letter
of the sentence.

02:30.667 --> 02:31.567
Damn it!

02:33.067 --> 02:33.900
- Yeah, it's a thing.

02:35.100 --> 02:36.400
- I mean, I'm impressed.

02:36.500 --> 02:38.067
I mean, it seems like
she's taught you

02:38.100 --> 02:39.400
some really cool things.

02:39.500 --> 02:42.500
- Yeah, it's, like,
the worst.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.167
- What if you just,
you know,

02:44.267 --> 02:46.100
kept her around in case
she has a crush

02:46.200 --> 02:47.833
on one of your friends?

02:47.933 --> 02:49.533
Mm...I don't have
any friends.

02:49.633 --> 02:53.367
- I thought I was
your friend.

02:57.267 --> 02:59.100
- Don't come in,
we're naked!

02:59.200 --> 03:01.933
- No you're not, you're both
wearing terrible clothes.

03:02.067 --> 03:03.733
- Maybe that's just what
our bare skin looks like.

03:03.833 --> 03:07.067
- Oh, hi Billie.
I didn't see you there.

03:07.100 --> 03:08.467
- Hello, Chet.

03:08.567 --> 03:10.400
- She knows I'm here.
I can't stand it.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.067
- I can hear you.

03:12.167 --> 03:14.400
Uh, Gene, did you start
your book report?

03:14.500 --> 03:16.367
- Yeah.
Done.

03:16.467 --> 03:18.533
Capital "D."
Lowercase "one."

03:18.633 --> 03:20.233
Damn it!

03:20.333 --> 03:22.367
- You read a whole book
and already wrote your report?

03:22.467 --> 03:25.467
- Yeah.
I read "The Grapes Gatsby."

03:25.567 --> 03:26.800
- Do you mean
"The Great Gatsby?"

03:26.900 --> 03:28.133
- Mm-hmm.

03:28.233 --> 03:29.833
- Okay.
Well, what's it about?

03:33.067 --> 03:34.967
It's about rich people.
- Uh-huh.

03:35.067 --> 03:36.400
- Who are in love.
- Mm-hmm.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.167
- And it's directed
by Baz Luhrmann.

03:38.267 --> 03:41.067
- It's written by Baz Luhrmann.

03:41.100 --> 03:42.567
- Okay.

03:42.667 --> 03:44.967
- And the music for the book
was done by Jay Z,

03:45.067 --> 03:46.467
and it stars Leo DiCaps,

03:46.567 --> 03:48.133
old Spider-Man,
and Borat's wife.

03:48.233 --> 03:49.300
- Okay, so you watched
the movie.

03:49.400 --> 03:50.533
You didn't read the book.

03:50.633 --> 03:51.833
- They made a movie
out of that?

03:51.933 --> 03:53.167
- Come on.
We'll start over.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.700
We'll pick a new book.
Come on.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.533
- And what's gonna happen
if I don't?

03:56.633 --> 03:58.400
- Uh, major consequences.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.133
- Major consequences.
- Yeah.

04:00.233 --> 04:02.133
- That sounds like a Disney
movie about the Army.

04:02.233 --> 04:05.200
- "Major Consequences,"
starring Zack and Cody!

04:06.667 --> 04:08.567
They would be in it!
- They would.

04:08.667 --> 04:10.167
- Totally they would star in it!
- Yeah!

04:10.267 --> 04:12.333
- Hey, Chet, do you want
to go to my guesthouse

04:12.433 --> 04:15.100
where all my underwear is
and pick a new book?

04:15.200 --> 04:17.267
- Yes, yes,
a thousand times, yes.

04:17.367 --> 04:18.800
- Great.

04:18.900 --> 04:20.967
Guess your plans have changed.

04:25.300 --> 04:27.267
- Oh, yes, "Fear and Loathing
in Las Vegas."

04:27.367 --> 04:29.200
You'd love this.
It's all about drugs.

04:29.300 --> 04:30.700
And there are bats in it.
Really cool--

04:30.800 --> 04:32.267
- Well they're my favorite
night creature, so...

04:32.367 --> 04:33.467
- Ooh, Gene, you might like
"Of Mice and Men."

04:33.567 --> 04:34.500
It's all about guys--

04:34.600 --> 04:35.633
- I'm already sold.

04:35.733 --> 04:37.133
Mice are my favorite
day creature.

04:37.233 --> 04:39.600
- Okay, so, we're off
to a good start.

04:39.700 --> 04:40.767
- I feel it too.

04:43.400 --> 04:46.467
Okay, let's just get
one more for safety.

04:46.567 --> 04:49.633
Um, "The Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn."

04:49.733 --> 04:51.633
It's a classic, and you
love adventure.

04:51.733 --> 04:53.433
- And Huckleberry's my jam.

04:53.533 --> 04:54.700
I put it on everything.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.933
English muffins.
Croissants.

04:57.067 --> 05:00.067
- So we have three
awesome options.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.067
- Guess they are kinda
three awesome options.

05:02.167 --> 05:04.867
Probably start these never.

05:04.967 --> 05:07.567
- I sincerely thought
she was gonna say "Now."

05:07.667 --> 05:10.633
- Look, I'm spending
the day with Chet.

05:10.733 --> 05:12.100
That's what I'm doing.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.400
And nobody's gonna
change that, okay?

05:14.500 --> 05:17.567
Sorry.
Is what it 'tis.

05:17.667 --> 05:19.167
- Chet, leave.
- Okay.

05:24.367 --> 05:27.333
I hate you, you're the worst,
just die!

05:27.433 --> 05:30.067
- You're still inside.

05:30.167 --> 05:31.600
- Die!

05:38.233 --> 05:39.133
Mr. Russell?

05:40.533 --> 05:41.467
- Can I talk to you
for a minute?

05:41.567 --> 05:42.667
- Yeah, sure thing, Bill.

05:42.767 --> 05:44.167
Hey, do you know
where my balls went?

05:44.267 --> 05:48.567
- I don't, uh, even know
how to answer that.

05:48.667 --> 05:50.900
Uh, it's about Gene.

05:51.067 --> 05:53.900
I--I'm having a hard time
getting her to do her work

05:54.067 --> 05:55.233
or not hate me.

05:55.333 --> 05:56.600
- Oh, well, you know,
she just takes

05:56.700 --> 05:57.633
some time warming up.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.133
You have to ease her
into it.

05:59.233 --> 06:01.367
It's like, uh--I should be
able to think of

06:01.467 --> 06:03.900
a better example...

06:04.067 --> 06:06.900
can't.
It's like date rape.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.233
- Yeah. Date rape.

06:09.333 --> 06:10.633
- Uh--I don't know--

06:10.733 --> 06:12.133
- You can't force her
into doing something,

06:12.233 --> 06:14.633
you have to take her out,
make her feel good.

06:14.733 --> 06:16.733
Well, then at the end
of the night, well,

06:16.833 --> 06:18.300
you get what I'm saying.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.067
Look, I'm--I'm late for my--
late for my match.

06:21.167 --> 06:22.200
Hope I was helpful.

06:22.300 --> 06:24.433
- Not at all.
- Hey, Joy!

06:24.533 --> 06:26.167
Have you seen my balls?

06:31.867 --> 06:34.200
- Bunch of rich weirdoes.

06:42.533 --> 06:43.967
- "This is Gene writing.

06:44.067 --> 06:46.200
"Meet me by the pool.
Let's talk books.

06:46.300 --> 06:50.067
"P.S. Ran out of
note paper."

06:50.133 --> 06:52.067
Bunch of rich weirdoes.

06:59.900 --> 07:01.733
Gene?

07:03.067 --> 07:04.667
Gene?

07:10.267 --> 07:12.067
- Ha, you thought I was gonna
push you in the pool.

07:17.433 --> 07:19.400
- You got my cast wet!

07:19.500 --> 07:20.667
- I don't know how to swim!
- Here, I'll help you.

07:20.767 --> 07:21.767
I'll help you.
I got you.

07:21.867 --> 07:24.167
- Ow, no, no!
No, no, no!

07:24.267 --> 07:26.067
- I'm not making a funny joke!

07:26.167 --> 07:28.067
- Get off of me!
- I can't.

07:28.167 --> 07:29.767
- You're weighing me
down, man.

07:29.867 --> 07:31.367
- I need you.

07:31.467 --> 07:33.833
Why are you so much heavier
than you are on land?

07:33.933 --> 07:36.067
- Wake up! Wake up!

07:36.133 --> 07:37.667
- I can't die!

07:37.767 --> 07:39.500
- I can't die, I've never
been to France.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.600
You're my sea pony.
- I am not your sea pony.

07:41.700 --> 07:43.233
- Giddy-up!
- Ahh!

07:43.333 --> 07:44.333
- Dinner!

07:44.433 --> 07:45.600
- Give it a rest, Joy.

07:45.700 --> 07:47.100
Everyone knows
your accent is fake.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.433
That is true.

07:49.533 --> 07:51.233
- Help us!
- Don't go chasing waterfalls.

07:51.333 --> 07:52.833
- No, no, no,
no, no!

07:52.933 --> 07:53.933
No, no!

08:02.633 --> 08:05.200
- Tanzy, what is this link
you just sent me?

08:05.300 --> 08:07.633
- It's all the Buzzfeed quizzes.

08:07.733 --> 08:09.900
I'm finding out what kind
of bird I would kill

08:10.067 --> 08:11.700
if I was a jaguar.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.567
- Oh, yeah.

08:13.667 --> 08:16.067
- You look ridiculous.
- Get a mirror.

08:17.933 --> 08:19.667
- Obviously I'm indicating
that you look the same.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.067
- Oh, indicating.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.167
Why don't you take
your five-dollar words

08:22.267 --> 08:23.533
and live off of that

08:23.633 --> 08:25.133
instead of living off
my dad's money.

08:25.233 --> 08:26.833
- Brring, brring!
Hold on, I have to take this.

08:28.767 --> 08:32.067
Oh, it's the ironic operator
from...Irony...town.

08:32.100 --> 08:34.300
- That's not a real phone.
Or a town.

08:34.400 --> 08:37.400
- Ha, it says Rip Torn
would play me

08:37.500 --> 08:39.367
in a movie about my life.

08:39.467 --> 08:41.800
- Ooh, I got Kate Blanket.

08:41.900 --> 08:44.600
- Oh.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.133
- I'm sorry to bother you,
but I think that

08:48.233 --> 08:50.300
if I'm gonna get Gene
to listen to me,

08:50.400 --> 08:52.400
we should lay down
some ground rules.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.100
- Also, I'm sorry I'm wet.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.867
- Gene, what do you have
to say about that?

08:56.967 --> 08:58.967
- I think it's disgusting
that she's telling everyone

08:59.067 --> 09:00.700
that she's sexually aroused
at the table.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.867
- I'm not sexually aroused.
- It's okay.

09:02.967 --> 09:05.067
It happens, just don't
tell everybody about it

09:05.133 --> 09:06.500
over a nice pasta salad.

09:06.600 --> 09:09.067
- How the heck
am I Chandler?

09:09.100 --> 09:10.167
- I don't know.

09:10.267 --> 09:11.300
- You know what
I just realized?

09:11.400 --> 09:13.600
And I don't say this lightly:

09:13.700 --> 09:15.933
I really don't like you.

09:16.067 --> 09:18.700
- Hey.
Get a mirror.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.267
- It doesn't work
in this instance

09:20.367 --> 09:22.067
because that would mean
I don't like myself.

09:22.133 --> 09:23.300
- And it's okay
that you don't.

09:23.400 --> 09:25.167
Everyone agrees
that you shouldn't.

09:25.267 --> 09:28.067
Everyone likes me.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.700
Who doesn't like me?

09:29.800 --> 09:31.333
- Easy-skeezy,
right off the bat.

09:31.433 --> 09:32.500
There's me.
- Good.

09:32.600 --> 09:33.633
- There's your parents.

09:33.733 --> 09:34.800
Who names their kid
that they like

09:34.900 --> 09:36.167
after Billy Crystal?

09:36.267 --> 09:38.433
- I was not named
after Billy Crystal.

09:38.533 --> 09:39.533
But even if I was,

09:39.633 --> 09:41.767
joke's all over you, babe,

09:41.867 --> 09:44.167
because "Forget Paris" is one
of my favorite movies.

09:44.267 --> 09:46.300
- I thought your favorite movie
was "Pretty Woman"

09:46.400 --> 09:48.667
because you love the opera
and you're a whore for money.

09:48.767 --> 09:50.867
- Well then your favorite movie
must be "Waterworld"

09:50.967 --> 09:53.267
because it was expensive
and terrible.

09:53.367 --> 09:54.433
Like you.

09:54.533 --> 09:56.267
- Ha, look at that.

09:56.367 --> 10:00.167
The quality I most admire
in a woman is earrings.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.667
- Mm-hmm.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.467
- I thought your favorite movie
was "Splash" because

10:04.567 --> 10:06.933
splash!

10:07.033 --> 10:08.267
- I'm already wet, idiot.

10:10.133 --> 10:11.100
- Is that supposed
to be me?

10:11.200 --> 10:12.500
- Yeah, this is also you.

10:12.600 --> 10:15.200
"Please, sir, do you have
any change?

10:15.300 --> 10:17.800
"I'm so very poor."

10:17.900 --> 10:20.033
- Mm-hmm.

10:20.133 --> 10:22.433
- No, it's cold outside.

10:22.533 --> 10:24.167
Temperature-wise.

10:24.267 --> 10:26.467
- Well, at least my daddy
doesn't have to pay people

10:26.567 --> 10:29.167
to hang out with me.

10:34.900 --> 10:38.100
- Hmm, my ginger
soul mate is

10:38.200 --> 10:40.200
Ed Sheeran.

10:40.300 --> 10:41.367
Huh.

10:41.467 --> 10:42.800
Where's Gene?

10:45.700 --> 10:47.067
- I'm not Gene.

10:47.167 --> 10:49.000
- Oh, yeah.

10:50.933 --> 10:53.067
- You're Billy Crystal.

10:53.167 --> 10:55.500
- Billy Crystal.
Funny.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.767
- Yeah, remember that movie
where we saw

10:57.867 --> 11:03.300
where he was in that
movie with the woman?

11:03.400 --> 11:04.333
- I saw that.

11:17.167 --> 11:19.100
Gene?

11:19.200 --> 11:22.667
Um, I brought you a beer
and some ice cream.

11:22.767 --> 11:24.067
I know you usually mix it,
I couldn't quite

11:24.100 --> 11:27.900
bring myself to do it,
but...

11:28.067 --> 11:30.967
a

11:31.067 --> 11:33.800
Anyway, I just wanted
to apologize for earlier

11:33.900 --> 11:36.467
at dinner, and, uh...

11:36.567 --> 11:37.633
that's it, really.

11:37.733 --> 11:39.800
I'm not very good at this.

11:39.900 --> 11:44.167
So, I'll just leave this here
in case you're still awake.

11:46.900 --> 11:49.167
Can you hear me?

11:49.267 --> 11:50.433
Gene?

11:52.467 --> 11:55.500
All right, well,
see you tomorrow.

11:56.633 --> 11:57.867
- No, you won't,

11:57.967 --> 12:00.100
'cause tomorrow...

12:00.200 --> 12:02.133
I'm gonna kill Bill.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.833
I heard you say my name.
What'd you say?

12:13.567 --> 12:15.200
- Honk-shoo, honk-shoo--

12:15.300 --> 12:16.733
- Are you just going
"honk

12:16.833 --> 12:23.200
At the door?
- Go away!

12:23.300 --> 12:25.933
- * Everyone's got
their own kinda power *

12:26.067 --> 12:30.333
* Everyone's power is cool
and unique *

12:35.500 --> 12:38.067
What the f--

12:38.133 --> 12:40.933
"All dicks welcome here,"
that's not true.

12:41.067 --> 12:43.100
So many bras...

12:43.200 --> 12:46.067
And they're not mine.

12:46.167 --> 12:48.933
Where would you even...
put it?

12:49.067 --> 12:49.933
- Hey, Billie,
I read my assignments,

12:50.067 --> 12:51.333
and the Bible.

12:51.433 --> 12:53.233
Oh, my gosh.

12:53.333 --> 12:54.733
- You did this.

12:54.833 --> 12:57.067
- I really hope
my dad slash your employer

12:57.100 --> 12:59.200
doesn't come in and see this.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.833
- Dad!
Dad, come now!

13:00.933 --> 13:02.133
Gene, I got a conference call

13:02.233 --> 13:03.667
with a chocolate company.

13:03.767 --> 13:07.067
- Don't look up
from your phone--oh, dang it.

13:07.100 --> 13:09.767
Oh, you're probably gonna want
to fire her now.

13:09.867 --> 13:11.567
This bite's the big one.

13:11.667 --> 13:13.633
Pack your stuff?

13:13.733 --> 13:16.067
- Mr. Russell, I...

13:16.133 --> 13:18.233
This is not my stuff.

13:18.333 --> 13:19.400
- Mm.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.400
- Although I do actually

13:20.500 --> 13:21.667
greatly enjoy that movie.

13:21.767 --> 13:22.833
"America n History X"?
It's--

13:22.933 --> 13:24.367
- I love it.

13:24.467 --> 13:26.233
- Me, too!

13:26.333 --> 13:28.067
With those arms?
Hold me.

13:28.133 --> 13:30.067
- How 'bout Edward Norton
with that semi-chub.

13:30.167 --> 13:31.967
Are you kidding me?
When he's getting arrested?

13:33.267 --> 13:34.467
- Yeah, what did you think
it was?

13:34.567 --> 13:35.667
- Like, a shorts bubble.

13:37.167 --> 13:38.667
- Oh, this is just all
Billie's stuff,

13:38.767 --> 13:39.800
so you probably want
to fire her.

13:39.900 --> 13:40.900
Pack your stuff.

13:41.067 --> 13:43.333
- Gene clearly staged
all of this

13:43.433 --> 13:44.533
to get me fired.

13:44.633 --> 13:45.833
- Mm-hmm.

13:45.933 --> 13:47.067
- Why would I wanna
get you fired?

13:47.133 --> 13:48.367
'Cause I don't want to watch

13:48.467 --> 13:49.833
"Garbage Men With Penises
Part VI"?

13:49.933 --> 13:51.700
- How do you know
the very specific,

13:51.800 --> 13:53.567
very bad title
of this porno?

13:53.667 --> 13:56.067
- Because it's one of the
best--I don't know.

13:56.100 --> 13:57.367
- You own it!
- No!

13:57.467 --> 13:59.333
- You were like, "Here I am
in the porn shop."

13:59.433 --> 14:01.133
"Garbage Men With Penises

14:01.233 --> 14:02.867
"Part VI"!

14:02.967 --> 14:04.767
- I've never been to a porn
sho

14:04.867 --> 14:06.133
A shop?
- Mr. Russell.

14:06.233 --> 14:07.867
- Mr. Russell, I--

14:07.967 --> 14:09.133
- No, don't listen to what
she's about to say, Dad.

14:09.233 --> 14:10.433
She's a coke-head.

14:10.533 --> 14:11.733
Look at her,
racing to it!

14:11.833 --> 14:13.200
Like a regular Tim Allen.

14:13.300 --> 14:14.933
- This is flour.
- Sure, Billie.

14:15.067 --> 14:17.700
The room is filled with
flowers, man!

14:17.800 --> 14:19.200
LSD!

14:19.300 --> 14:20.867
- You're covering the wrong
side of your mouth.

14:20.967 --> 14:23.067
- She's on LSD, Dad!

14:23.133 --> 14:25.067
- Gene, this is very, very
creative stuff.

14:25.133 --> 14:27.167
Really, it is,
but as I said,

14:27.267 --> 14:30.367
I have a call,
and the chocolate people wait

14:30.467 --> 14:32.100
for no man.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.067
- Excuse me.

14:34.133 --> 14:35.300
Mr. Russell.

14:35.400 --> 14:36.667
Mr. Russell.

14:36.767 --> 14:38.100
Hi.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.200
Is that all you're gonna
say about that?

14:39.300 --> 14:40.667
- It's just Gene,
all right?

14:40.767 --> 14:42.367
She's like a--oh, what's
a good analogy?

14:42.467 --> 14:44.700
She's like Y2K,

14:44.800 --> 14:47.200
which everybody thought was
gonna be this huge disaster,

14:47.300 --> 14:48.700
then nothing happened.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.133
- That's terrible.
- Yeah.

14:51.467 --> 14:53.100
- Still have a garage
full of soup.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.467
- No, I mean, don't you
think there should be some

14:54.567 --> 14:56.533
consequences or guidance

14:56.633 --> 14:57.633
from you?

14:57.733 --> 14:59.133
- Don't listen to her, Dad.

14:59.233 --> 15:00.767
She's a sex addict
who loves trash dicks.

15:00.867 --> 15:05.500
- I don't love trash
di--I have normal urges.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.267
Oh, God--Gene respects you,
and I don't think that

15:08.367 --> 15:09.767
that applies to many people.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.433
I think she would stop
if you'd just

15:11.533 --> 15:13.233
lay down the law a little.

15:13.333 --> 15:14.967
- I knew there was a reason
I hired you.

15:15.067 --> 15:16.467
You're smart.

15:16.567 --> 15:17.667
- Thank you.
- Come on, let's go.

15:17.767 --> 15:18.667
No, I thought you had

15:18.767 --> 15:20.167
a chocolate emergency.

15:20.267 --> 15:21.267
- It's my daughter.
What's wrong with you?

15:21.367 --> 15:24.467
- Oh, yes.

15:24.567 --> 15:25.667
- Yeah.
- I'm--I'm coming.

15:25.767 --> 15:26.933
- Okay.
- All right.

15:27.067 --> 15:28.667
- Oh, gross,
but also natural?

15:28.767 --> 15:30.800
- Gene, your dad would like
to talk to you.

15:30.900 --> 15:32.067
- Yeah.

15:32.167 --> 15:33.333
- Cool, cool, cool,
is it to tell me

15:33.433 --> 15:34.667
that uh...he fired you?

15:34.767 --> 15:35.733
Pack your stuff?

15:35.833 --> 15:39.633
- All right, Gene,
I, um...

15:39.733 --> 15:42.333
- Need to talk to you.
- Need to talk to...

15:42.433 --> 15:43.933
- You.
- You.

15:44.067 --> 15:47.333
What you did was...

15:49.100 --> 15:52.233
bad.
And...

15:52.333 --> 15:53.400
Get out of the house.

15:53.500 --> 15:54.633
- No, she's on
house arrest, so--

15:54.733 --> 15:56.067
- She has to stay here.

15:56.167 --> 15:58.333
Clean the room.
- Clean the room!

15:58.433 --> 15:59.633
- Do the book report.

15:59.733 --> 16:01.167
- And report a book.

16:01.267 --> 16:02.500
- That's good.
That's close enough.

16:02.600 --> 16:03.667
- Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

16:03.767 --> 16:05.500
- I would love to.
- Mm-hmm.

16:05.600 --> 16:08.067
- But I don't want to.

16:08.167 --> 16:09.400
- Okay, well, that's solved.
- No, no, no.

16:10.833 --> 16:12.400
- Oh, yeah.
- But she has to.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.933
- Yeah.
- Yes.

16:14.067 --> 16:15.467
- Oh, right, right.
Makes sense to me now.

16:15.567 --> 16:16.633
- Yeah, yes. Here we go.
- Okay.

16:16.733 --> 16:18.867
- Gene.

16:18.967 --> 16:20.467
- You have to.

16:20.567 --> 16:21.767
- No.

16:21.867 --> 16:23.633
- More stern.
- More stern. Okay.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.633
- You have to!
- Oh, my God!

16:25.733 --> 16:27.267
- I wasn't gonna hit her!

16:27.367 --> 16:29.867
I just--I was just threatening
her, a little bit.

16:29.967 --> 16:33.967
- Just use your voice.
- Okay. All right.

16:34.067 --> 16:35.633
Gene,

16:35.733 --> 16:37.533
I want you to clean
this room right now,

16:37.633 --> 16:39.367
and after that, I want you
to do your book report,

16:39.467 --> 16:41.600
and from here on out,

16:41.700 --> 16:43.433
you will listen
to what...

16:43.533 --> 16:46.400
- Billie.
- Billie tells you to do

16:46.500 --> 16:50.767
Or I will be very, very
disappointed

16:50.867 --> 16:54.233
in you.

16:54.333 --> 16:57.933
- Fine.

16:58.067 --> 16:59.467
- That was great.
- That was really good.

16:59.567 --> 17:01.200
- That was so great!
- You did so good.

17:01.300 --> 17:03.067
- My God, you're so brave
and authoritative.

17:03.100 --> 17:05.267
- Well, you know.
- My God.

17:05.367 --> 17:07.367
Oh, and Gene?

17:07.467 --> 17:09.967
You can leave that poster.

17:10.067 --> 17:14.167
Thanks.
Mm.

17:14.267 --> 17:19.800
- Stupid book report!

17:19.900 --> 17:22.433
- Sorry if this book report's
not very good.

17:22.533 --> 17:24.933
I've been up late
working hard on it,

17:25.067 --> 17:26.467
but then also "School Ties"
came on,

17:26.567 --> 17:28.100
and that's one of
my favorite movies,

17:28.200 --> 17:29.700
which is surprising,
'cause I don't like

17:29.800 --> 17:32.467
anything school-related, but
I love Jewish-themed movies.

17:32.567 --> 17:33.867
- No, that's okay.

17:33.967 --> 17:35.333
- Why are you interrupting
the book report?

17:35.433 --> 17:37.067
- Oh, I didn't realize you...

17:37.100 --> 17:39.067
Are you reading that
off the page?

17:39.133 --> 17:40.833
- Yes!
- Oh. Sorry.

17:40.933 --> 17:42.667
It was so conversational,
I thought we were just talking.

17:42.767 --> 17:45.067
- Okay, well now I lost
my frickin' spot.

17:45.167 --> 17:47.100
- I'm sorry.
- Just let me...

17:47.200 --> 17:50.867
All flustered now.

17:50.967 --> 17:52.733
I did my book report on

17:52.833 --> 17:55.233
"Fear and Loathing
in Las Vegas."

17:55.333 --> 17:59.067
I liked it slash it was
confusing as .

17:59.133 --> 18:01.133
The book starts
with Raoul Duke

18:01.233 --> 18:02.833
behind the wheel
of a convertible.

18:05.233 --> 18:08.300
He realizes the drugs he took
earlier are kicking in.

18:08.400 --> 18:09.333
- They're kicking in,
the drugs, yes?

18:11.067 --> 18:13.600
- Next to him sits
his 300-pound attorney,

18:13.700 --> 18:18.400
Dr. Gonzo,
aka The Fat Samoan.

18:20.067 --> 18:21.800
- They were headed
to Vegas from L.A.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.233
- Let's go to Vegas.

18:23.333 --> 18:25.167
- And there were bats
and stuff.

18:25.267 --> 18:28.067
- I see two more.
- I see bats.

18:31.567 --> 18:33.633
- It's real. It's real.

18:33.733 --> 18:35.100
- They're on their way
to Vegas,

18:35.200 --> 18:36.633
but they got derailed

18:36.733 --> 18:38.300
because Lenny is like,

18:38.400 --> 18:40.300
"Curley, what's up
with your hand?"

18:40.400 --> 18:41.967
- I like to keep my hand
nice and soft

18:42.067 --> 18:45.133
so I can touch my girlfriend.

18:45.233 --> 18:47.100
Aw, that feels gross.

18:47.200 --> 18:48.833
Wait, who's Lennie?

18:48.933 --> 18:51.167
- Me--sometimes, uh,
Raoul Duke

18:51.267 --> 18:52.967
calls himself Lennie.

18:53.067 --> 18:54.100
- Got it.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.167
- So they took off.

18:55.267 --> 18:57.600
- This plane's going fast.

18:57.700 --> 19:00.567
- I don't think planes
were invented yet.

19:00.667 --> 19:02.467
- They continued their journey.

19:02.567 --> 19:05.333
- Cow, cow, cow, cow.

19:05.433 --> 19:07.400
- That's not a cow.
That's a tire.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.367
- It was much easier
for them to get to Vegas

19:09.467 --> 19:12.367
by taking the good ol'
Mississippi River.

19:12.467 --> 19:14.200
- We gotta catch that
riverboat.

19:14.300 --> 19:16.200
- I agree with you.

19:18.067 --> 19:19.700
- Just this minnow.

19:19.800 --> 19:21.333
Uh-oh.

19:21.433 --> 19:22.367
You want it?

19:22.467 --> 19:24.133
- Nice minnow!

19:24.233 --> 19:27.900
- And by that time, Dr. Gonzo
was a free man.

19:29.167 --> 19:30.067
- Gene.

19:30.167 --> 19:31.200
- Whoosh.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.700
- Gene!

19:32.800 --> 19:34.800
- Okay.
Gimme that.

19:34.900 --> 19:37.067
- Okay.
- And get off my desk.

19:37.100 --> 19:39.867
- Jeez. Demanding.

19:39.967 --> 19:41.233
Any questions?

19:41.333 --> 19:42.967
You with the stupid glasses
in the front?

19:43.067 --> 19:45.433
- How many of the books
that I gave you did you read?

19:45.533 --> 19:47.400
'Cause it feels like you read
parts of all of them

19:47.500 --> 19:49.067
without noticing
they were different,

19:49.133 --> 19:50.800
and wove them into one story.

19:50.900 --> 19:53.200
- Okay, CSI Miami,
if you say so.

19:53.300 --> 19:54.733
Or--any of the CSI's
would work.

19:54.833 --> 19:57.567
- Didn't you notice that
the names kept changing?

19:57.667 --> 19:59.267
- Yeah, but I thought
they were, like, nicknames.

19:59.367 --> 20:01.933
Like, how some people call me
"Genie" or "Goosetits."

20:02.033 --> 20:03.700
Really wish that one
would go away.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.233
- How is that
even possible?

20:05.333 --> 20:08.467
- Oh, guys said that my tits
looked like goose beaks.

20:10.700 --> 20:12.767
- I meant that you read
three different books

20:12.867 --> 20:13.933
without noticing?

20:14.033 --> 20:16.033
- Well at least I tried.
Jeez.

20:16.133 --> 20:17.600
- Do you mind if I actually
go finish them?

20:17.700 --> 20:18.867
Because now that I know
that the ending isn't

20:18.967 --> 20:20.233
that Huck and Lennie
go to L.A.,

20:20.333 --> 20:21.533
I kinda want to find out
what happens.

20:21.633 --> 20:23.367
- Sure, Gene.

20:23.467 --> 20:25.133
Class over. Go.
- Okay.

20:25.233 --> 20:26.267
- Oh, and can I borrow
a few books

20:26.367 --> 20:27.367
from your guesthouse?

20:27.467 --> 20:29.733
- Yeah, have at it.
Go nuts.

20:29.833 --> 20:31.833
- Can't wait.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.100
Wait a minute.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.933
Gene likes reading.

20:38.033 --> 20:39.933
She likes to read.

20:40.033 --> 20:41.700
I did it.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.533
I did it.

20:43.633 --> 20:44.633
Oh, God.
Mr. Russell?

20:44.733 --> 20:46.200
- I did it.

20:46.300 --> 20:48.433
I got through.

20:48.533 --> 20:49.433
- Yeah...

20:49.533 --> 20:53.167
-I...
I raped your daughter.

20:53.267 --> 20:56.300
- That a Bill.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.000
- Date raped her!
Who am I?

21:07.100 --> 21:10.833
- He was in that movie
with that funny guy.

21:10.933 --> 21:12.333
- Oh, yeah.
I love that.

21:12.433 --> 21:15.267
- He's Jewish.
- Hmm.

21:15.367 --> 21:17.867
- Sometimes he wears
a yarmulke.

21:17.967 --> 21:19.067
On television.
I saw it.

21:19.167 --> 21:19.567
- I'm gone.
