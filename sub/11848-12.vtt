02:06.480 --> 02:11.720
Enter if you must.
Just push that **.

02:13.540 --> 02:15.580
And knock like a woodpecker

02:15.615 --> 02:18.257
and it just hammers
right through my brain.

02:18.292 --> 02:21.465
You knock like a man with a big
boom, boom, boom, and I'm fine,

02:21.500 --> 02:24.820
but this little birdy, tippie, tappie,
tippie, tappie is like to make my eyes

02:24.855 --> 02:26.355
pop out of my head.

02:26.360 --> 02:29.640
Come on in and sit by the fire
where I can see you.

02:30.980 --> 02:34.160
My eyes are not so sharp any more.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.760
Mrs. Carnation?

02:37.960 --> 02:40.400
Depends on who ask.

02:42.321 --> 02:44.201
My name is Edward Ralston.

02:44.236 --> 02:45.636
Handsome man.

02:46.841 --> 02:48.921
You are Mrs. Carnation.

02:49.802 --> 02:51.327
The necromancer?

02:51.362 --> 02:54.862
Been many long years
since anybody called me that.

02:54.897 --> 02:59.528
- But you are she?
- Let's say I once was she.

02:59.563 --> 03:02.643
Madame.
I'm in desperate need of your help.

03:02.803 --> 03:07.044
I cannot help the likes of
prosperous young gentleman like you!

03:07.079 --> 03:08.784
But I was told you
could raise the dead.

03:08.819 --> 03:10.644
Well, you was told wrongly.

03:11.164 --> 03:14.405
- You cannot raise the dead?
- I will not raise the dead!

03:14.605 --> 03:19.045
Not even for so comely a
gentleman as yourself.

03:19.725 --> 03:21.126
Madame.

03:21.526 --> 03:25.766
I have just come from the funeral
of my beloved wife, Samantha.

03:25.901 --> 03:28.772
A lovelier and more vibrant woman
you could never hope to meet.

03:28.807 --> 03:32.007
You're sure your wife is
all you said she was?

03:32.167 --> 03:34.527
Let her go with God,

03:34.562 --> 03:36.888
and lie in peace.

03:37.048 --> 03:40.333
I cannot help you.

03:40.368 --> 03:42.608
But you hold the power
to bring her back to me.

03:43.488 --> 03:46.609
- And yet you refuse!
- It's for your own good.

03:46.644 --> 03:48.329
And for my own.

03:50.089 --> 03:54.210
- I'm all used up!
- And why not?

03:56.090 --> 03:58.690
Why would you help us erase my grief?

03:59.691 --> 04:03.091
Why would you not bring back
the woman I love to me?

04:09.212 --> 04:14.652
Have you heard the
story of Ernst Haeckel?

04:14.692 --> 04:16.773
What does he have to do with this!

04:16.892 --> 04:20.273
Oh, young sir.
He has everything to do with this.

04:20.933 --> 04:23.754
If I tell you my story
and you still wish your

04:23.789 --> 04:26.574
beloved Samantha
brought back from the dead,

04:26.575 --> 04:30.914
then I would gladly grant you your wish.

04:32.581 --> 04:34.034
Do you mean that?

04:34.035 --> 04:36.527
If you love is so great,

04:36.815 --> 04:38.816
then yes!

04:40.656 --> 04:43.596
I will bring your wife back to you.

04:43.756 --> 04:46.417
No love is greater.
I swear to you!

04:47.457 --> 04:49.457
We shall see!

04:51.137 --> 04:53.337
We shall see!

04:53.938 --> 04:55.057
Now...

04:55.058 --> 04:58.658
Sit with you back to the fire
and I shall tell you my tale.

04:58.693 --> 05:01.018
It hurts my neck to look up at you.

05:06.779 --> 05:08.859
Well...

05:17.020 --> 05:20.106
Ernst Haeckel...

05:20.141 --> 05:24.061
was a medical student in Massachusetts.

05:24.096 --> 05:27.782
A cocky young man.
Thought he knew it all.

05:27.822 --> 05:29.302
Do go on.

05:30.422 --> 05:33.143
Well, this was some time ago,

05:33.178 --> 05:35.383
50 years, or more...

05:35.903 --> 05:38.863
A more naive age.

05:40.424 --> 05:42.704
Not so filled with...

05:43.424 --> 05:45.384
answers...

05:46.464 --> 05:48.190
... as today.

05:48.225 --> 05:53.305
It is man laid out in his
final inglorious chapter.

05:53.465 --> 05:57.946
Devoid of his soul,
all that is is left is flesh.

05:57.981 --> 06:02.626
A machine without power.
A mere husk, an empty vessel.

06:02.986 --> 06:06.867
Only God in his wisdom may
grant life and take it away.

06:07.107 --> 06:11.347
So, you, my young charges are
the instruments of God's will.

06:11.383 --> 06:13.645
And it is up to you to serve him well.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.908
What has God to do with man?

06:15.943 --> 06:18.433
Ahh, our young heathen.

06:18.468 --> 06:21.869
Well, why don't you tell me and
the class all about it, Mr. Haeckel?

06:22.069 --> 06:26.549
Man and woman
fornicate to create life.

06:26.669 --> 06:30.230
Accident, disease, or old age
take it away.

06:30.430 --> 06:33.035
Your God has nothing to do with it.

06:33.070 --> 06:37.791
He is our God, Mr Haeckel, not my own,
and he has everything to do with it.

06:37.826 --> 06:39.876
There is no man without God!

06:39.911 --> 06:43.612
I am a man without God, Dr. Hauser.

06:43.792 --> 06:48.572
Well, you may think so, sir, but you are
wrong.  There is no life without God.

06:48.712 --> 06:51.633
I take it you're unfamiliar with
recent experiments in Germany,

06:51.668 --> 06:53.153
which have proven otherwise.

06:53.193 --> 06:56.693
I am well aware of the tales of
Victor Frankenstein, Mr. Haeckel.

06:56.728 --> 06:59.334
And they are fairy tales.
Wishful thinking.

06:59.834 --> 07:04.554
Scripture tells us that the
Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.

07:04.994 --> 07:09.755
God gives us life and once he
takes it away, it is gone for good.

07:09.790 --> 07:12.715
And you believe that
there is no life after death?

07:12.835 --> 07:16.336
Oh, I believe in an afterlife, sir,
but not in the reanimation

07:16.371 --> 07:17.996
of the human corpse.

07:18.356 --> 07:23.077
Then what on earth do you
celebrate every Easter Sunday?

07:23.797 --> 07:26.437
This is an entirely different
matter, young man.

07:26.597 --> 07:29.203
God may resurrect.
Man may not.

07:29.238 --> 07:31.283
And I believe that you are wrong, sir.

07:31.318 --> 07:35.718
What you believe is entirely of no
consequence to me my young free thinker!

07:35.753 --> 07:39.079
Why don't you tell it to
our poor Mr. Willaby here?

07:39.599 --> 07:41.764
I can prove it, professor.

07:41.799 --> 07:45.660
Oh, I'm sure that you can inseminate,
Mr Haeckel, much as that might distress me.

07:45.695 --> 07:49.520
But it is God and God alone
who grants us the spark of life.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.119
No, Professor.

07:51.120 --> 07:54.901
I mean that I can give life to the dead.

07:57.801 --> 08:01.322
Well, I shall very much like to see that.

08:01.357 --> 08:03.522
I imagine that you should.

08:11.523 --> 08:13.523
This unfortunate young woman

08:13.563 --> 08:16.444
died of consumption
just over a week ago.

08:16.479 --> 08:18.544
How did you acquired her body?

08:18.924 --> 08:21.964
- Does it really matter?
- It matters a great deal, young man.

08:22.004 --> 08:24.645
And how does the University
acquire its cadavers?

08:24.725 --> 08:27.485
From accredited legal sources.

08:29.325 --> 08:33.131
Your father is a pious
and wise man, Mr. Haeckel.

08:33.166 --> 08:35.504
Surely he does not
approve of this blasphemy.

08:35.505 --> 08:37.105
You know nothing of my father!

08:37.366 --> 08:40.087
My father approves of the truth.

08:44.006 --> 08:47.348
I've been following the notes of the
German scientist quite specifically.

08:47.408 --> 08:50.768
And I've been able to harness
the electrical power of the lightning.

08:50.928 --> 08:52.848
My challenge is then

08:53.168 --> 08:55.709
to channel that power

08:56.129 --> 08:57.814
through these copper ropes

08:57.849 --> 09:01.890
and into the body, and
thereby ignite the spark of life.

09:04.810 --> 09:07.690
This girl shall live again.

09:09.050 --> 09:10.451
Now...

09:15.291 --> 09:18.732
Watch this!

09:46.255 --> 09:47.614
Well ..

09:47.615 --> 09:52.216
It appears divinity is still a long
ways off for you, is it not Mr. Haeckel?

09:53.296 --> 09:54.696
Quiet!

09:58.697 --> 10:01.617
May God forgive you, sir.

10:15.339 --> 10:17.419
I'm so sorry.

10:20.580 --> 10:22.145
Hello, Chester.

10:22.180 --> 10:23.580
Good evening, sir.

10:23.780 --> 10:26.063
How fare is your father,
the elder Dr. Haeckel?

10:26.064 --> 10:28.181
I hope that his condition is better.

10:29.161 --> 10:32.061
- He is not well, Chester?
- Not well at all.

10:32.301 --> 10:36.862
Well, please give him my best wishes
and salutations for me, will you sir?

10:38.502 --> 10:39.902
Oh, my!

10:40.222 --> 10:42.262
Is that...?

10:42.582 --> 10:45.143
Still dead, eh, Mr. Ernst?

10:55.704 --> 10:57.264
You're lucky I'm here.

10:57.584 --> 10:59.865
Got some good beef with me tonight!

11:05.545 --> 11:08.266
Pneumonia.
Just last night.

11:08.386 --> 11:11.226
And a real bargain at $10.

11:11.261 --> 11:12.661
Not tonight, Chester.

11:12.666 --> 11:14.187
Money is tight, isn't it Mr. Ernst?

11:14.222 --> 11:18.307
Always!  A thousand, a hundred,
even ten dollars.

11:18.547 --> 11:20.227
I've failed.

11:20.347 --> 11:24.388
The key to life after death
is still beyond my reach.

11:24.423 --> 11:26.413
Well, chin up, sir.
You're a young man.

11:26.448 --> 11:29.048
You'll surely figure out the
mysteries of life and death

11:29.083 --> 11:31.549
before you shuffle off
this mortal **, right?

11:31.584 --> 11:33.669
I'm in no mood for sarcasm, Chester.

11:33.704 --> 11:35.104
Sarcastic?

11:35.309 --> 11:37.755
- Me?
- Yes, Chester.  You.

11:37.790 --> 11:40.110
Well, if it's life after death you seek,

11:40.145 --> 11:42.195
should you not speak with a necromancer?

11:42.230 --> 11:44.870
They place their faith in
magic and the supernatural.

11:45.671 --> 11:48.271
I believe in science.
Not fairy stories.

11:48.306 --> 11:49.876
Well, Mr. Haeckel,

11:49.911 --> 11:52.391
I'm a simple uneducated man.

11:52.952 --> 11:55.752
Science and magic
seem one of a kind to me.

11:56.712 --> 12:00.838
I saw Montesquino, the necromancer,
down to the park of a weekend.

12:00.873 --> 12:04.033
And his magic seemed pretty
scientifical to me, young sir.

12:04.068 --> 12:06.033
He made the dead rise!

12:06.753 --> 12:08.354
But as I said,

12:08.594 --> 12:11.274
I'm not so sophisticated as you.

12:11.874 --> 12:16.215
But I think that we should be careful
when we talk about necromancers.

12:16.475 --> 12:19.209
Why should we be careful
talking about a little English prick

12:19.210 --> 12:20.716
who preys upon our women?

12:20.751 --> 12:23.080
Good Lord!  He practically
steals form their purses!

12:23.115 --> 12:26.316
- Claiming he can raise the dead.
- And how do you know he cannot?

12:26.836 --> 12:30.231
- Why you and not he?
- Science, Chester.

12:30.556 --> 12:32.797
Not balderdash.

12:32.997 --> 12:36.077
I believe the evidence of
my eyes, young master.

12:36.397 --> 12:39.002
And I saw what I take to be proof

12:39.037 --> 12:42.958
that such crafts as this
Montesquino professes are real.

12:43.638 --> 12:46.138
I should not dismiss it out of hand!

12:46.478 --> 12:49.159
Perhaps you should see for yourself.

12:58.560 --> 13:02.881
What is the line between life and death?

13:03.161 --> 13:08.601
Between darkness and light,
between existence and infinity?

13:09.321 --> 13:12.407
I am here to tell you,

13:12.442 --> 13:15.722
that the dead can live again!

13:15.922 --> 13:19.528
I possess that mystical secret,

13:19.563 --> 13:25.403
held until now only by the
secret shaman of Zanzibar.

13:25.843 --> 13:28.544
It came to me at great cost,

13:28.584 --> 13:32.244
and it is a power that
I do not use lightly.

13:32.924 --> 13:36.445
With power comes responsibility.

13:37.325 --> 13:40.925
For each life I grant,

13:40.960 --> 13:44.491
takes a year off my own!

13:44.526 --> 13:48.606
But because of the sacred trust I hold,

13:48.641 --> 13:51.087
it is well worth it!

13:55.927 --> 13:59.228
I sense disbelieve among you.

14:01.288 --> 14:02.968
Young man.

14:07.969 --> 14:11.800
I gather an educated
man such as yourself,

14:11.804 --> 14:14.613
would require proof of
such a proclamation.

14:14.648 --> 14:16.135
I would indeed, sir.

14:16.170 --> 14:18.690
And what would convince
you of my powers?

14:19.050 --> 14:22.951
Not this side show,
Professor Montesquino.

14:23.411 --> 14:25.371
I ask you again, son.

14:25.531 --> 14:30.012
What proof will you require
that I tell the truth?

14:30.347 --> 14:33.892
Nothing less than to see the
dead revive before my own eyes.

14:34.252 --> 14:37.353
And you shall have it, young man.

14:47.414 --> 14:48.814
Behold!

14:50.294 --> 14:51.695
Death!

14:53.855 --> 14:57.815
This miserable cur is dead, is he not?

15:00.296 --> 15:02.156
Quite dead, sir.

15:34.860 --> 15:36.760
Behold.

15:38.461 --> 15:41.661
Life after death!

16:13.505 --> 16:16.631
You do believe your own eyes,
don't you young man?

16:16.666 --> 16:22.226
To resurrect a simple beast, is not nearly
so taxing as bringing back a human being.

16:22.261 --> 16:24.592
A man with a soul.

16:24.627 --> 16:27.547
Compared to that,
this is merely a parlour trick.

16:27.667 --> 16:31.352
Man... is far more complex.

16:31.387 --> 16:33.548
Are you saying a dog
doesn't have a soul?

16:33.583 --> 16:35.588
I am, young sir.

16:38.028 --> 16:39.748
Professor Montesquino?

16:40.789 --> 16:42.849
Yes, my good man?

16:44.389 --> 16:46.069
My wife and I...

16:46.269 --> 16:49.310
We lost our little girl to
diphtheria in the summer.

16:49.345 --> 16:51.230
She was about 3 years old.

16:51.390 --> 16:53.795
We wondered... if you could...

16:53.830 --> 16:57.751
- Do you have a hundred dollars.
- Oh, no sir.  No where near.

16:57.786 --> 17:01.711
So how much do you think a
year of my life is worth?

17:02.431 --> 17:04.352
I wouldn't know, sir.

17:04.387 --> 17:07.692
I should say it's worth
more than a hundred dollars.

17:08.791 --> 17:10.953
Could you get a hundred dollars?

17:11.873 --> 17:14.992
Well, we were hoping
that as a good Christian,

17:15.028 --> 17:16.873
you might find it in the goodness...

17:16.907 --> 17:18.719
I'm sorry.

17:18.753 --> 17:23.914
Find the $100 and... I'll bring
your little girl back to you.

17:23.949 --> 17:26.434
I regret I'm not a charity.

17:26.555 --> 17:28.119
And now,

17:28.155 --> 17:32.800
who would like to have their
late bereaved loved ones

17:32.810 --> 17:35.096
back in their arms again?

17:38.276 --> 17:40.696
What about you, young man?

17:51.398 --> 17:53.078
Montesquino?

17:55.718 --> 17:58.879
The young doubting charmers.
A good evening to you, sir.

17:58.914 --> 18:01.919
- And to you.
- I was delighted to see you.

18:01.954 --> 18:04.156
I'm having my supper.

18:04.191 --> 18:06.560
Perhaps you can return in the morning.

18:18.481 --> 18:21.042
My name is Ernst Haeckel.

18:21.762 --> 18:23.847
I am a medical student
at the University.

18:23.882 --> 18:26.402
And I wish to enquire of your ways.

18:27.362 --> 18:29.863
A man of science.

18:30.523 --> 18:33.603
Well, perhaps a boy of science.

18:33.963 --> 18:37.604
I'm absolutely thrilled to
meet you, Mr. Haeckel.

18:37.639 --> 18:39.889
But I'm not here to instruct you.

18:39.924 --> 18:44.205
My knowledge came after
many years of intense instruction.

18:44.365 --> 18:47.325
With great risk to my life and limb.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.045
I am willing to take risks.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.125
Are you indeed?

18:55.006 --> 18:59.166
The costs are greater
than a bottle of whiskey.

18:59.767 --> 19:02.567
I know you do not believe in my ways.

19:02.602 --> 19:05.532
That you think that
necromancy is tripe.

19:05.567 --> 19:08.768
- A side show for the gullible, huh?
- Is it not?

19:08.803 --> 19:10.968
The dog.
An excellent trick.

19:11.368 --> 19:13.528
You threw your voice, did you not?

19:13.768 --> 19:16.174
And the movement of the dead dog...

19:16.209 --> 19:18.329
some sort of puppetry I'd wager.

19:18.364 --> 19:19.688
You would, won't you?

19:19.689 --> 19:22.189
Surely necromancy cannot be real.

19:22.224 --> 19:25.090
Well, if you say it cannot,

19:25.125 --> 19:27.090
then it cannot.

19:27.130 --> 19:31.251
Who am I to question
the likes of such a...

19:31.371 --> 19:36.051
a brilliant educated
young man like yourself?

19:36.551 --> 19:39.732
- So you would not even argue with me?
- No, sir.  I do not.

19:39.772 --> 19:44.052
I'm tired.  I need sleep.
Sweet dreams, young man.

19:45.452 --> 19:47.853
And thanks for the bottle.

20:10.016 --> 20:11.656
Mr. Haeckel?

20:12.216 --> 20:13.616
What is it?

20:14.236 --> 20:17.016
I am told it concerns your father.

20:19.737 --> 20:21.137
Thank you.

20:26.778 --> 20:28.738
<i>My dearest master Haeckel,</i>

20:28.778 --> 20:31.498
<i>your father's illness
is taking a turn for the worse.</i>

20:31.578 --> 20:34.344
<i>His malaise has turned
much more serious.</i>

20:34.379 --> 20:36.739
<i>And the prognosis is not optimistic.</i>

20:36.979 --> 20:40.139
<i>He may only have
a matter of days remaining.</i>

20:40.179 --> 20:43.780
<i>He wishes to see you before he passes.</i>

20:43.980 --> 20:47.020
<i>Sincerely, Dr. Alfred Harwell.</i>

23:46.844 --> 23:48.244
Life.

23:54.485 --> 23:56.245
And death.

23:57.285 --> 23:59.085
And one day...

23:59.445 --> 24:01.725
I shall make you live again.

24:22.628 --> 24:23.687
Jesus!

24:23.688 --> 24:27.289
My deepest apology, young sir.
I did not mean to cause you fright.

24:27.324 --> 24:28.724
You startled me!

24:29.469 --> 24:31.574
It would not be good for
you sleep here tonight.

24:31.609 --> 24:34.590
This an open road.  I have every
right to stay here if I wish to.

24:34.625 --> 24:37.770
Of course you do.  I did not say the
right was not yours.  I simply said...

24:37.805 --> 24:39.930
it would not be wise.

24:40.370 --> 24:42.256
My apologies.

24:42.291 --> 24:44.851
I'm cold, and tired and hungry...

24:45.851 --> 24:47.811
- I meant no insult.
- None taken.

24:48.371 --> 24:50.212
I am Walter Wolfram.

24:50.247 --> 24:52.252
A pleasure to make your acquaintance.

24:52.532 --> 24:54.972
My name is Ernst Haeckel.

24:55.092 --> 24:57.813
I'm traveling to Windsor.
My father it seems...

24:59.333 --> 25:00.692
... very ill.

25:00.693 --> 25:03.353
I live nearby.  I can
offer you a warm dry bed,

25:03.388 --> 25:06.214
a proper fire, some hot potato soup.

25:06.334 --> 25:08.294
An offer I cannot decline.

25:08.374 --> 25:10.214
Many thanks to you, sir.

25:19.175 --> 25:24.336
Why do you think it's...
unwise for me stay in this place?

25:24.616 --> 25:26.336
You are a young man.

25:26.376 --> 25:29.297
I have no doubt you do not fear
the workings of this world.

25:29.497 --> 25:32.302
But believe me when
I tell you there are nights,

25:32.337 --> 25:38.118
when it is good... not to sleep next
to a place where the dead are laid.

25:39.778 --> 25:41.458
- The dead?
- Aye.

25:41.493 --> 25:42.893
Their home.

25:43.939 --> 25:45.819
The necropolis.

25:57.200 --> 26:01.101
I am a medical student.
I do not fear the dead.

26:02.461 --> 26:05.221
Then I suppose you are a lucky man.

26:06.462 --> 26:07.862
Come.

26:27.304 --> 26:30.225
It is not much, but it is warm and dry.

26:34.105 --> 26:35.785
Elise?

26:39.506 --> 26:44.826
Elise, this is Ernst Haeckel.
He will be staying with us tonight.

26:45.227 --> 26:47.587
Mr. Haeckel.
This is my wife.

26:47.987 --> 26:49.387
Elise.

26:57.748 --> 27:00.228
It is a great pleasure to meet you.

27:05.429 --> 27:08.795
Elise, get Mr. Haeckel some wine.

27:08.830 --> 27:11.710
He has burdened with the cruelty
of the elements for several days.

27:37.193 --> 27:39.754
Mr. Haeckel is on his way to Windsor.

27:39.834 --> 27:42.959
- The father is ill. Maybe dying.
- I'm sorry.

27:42.994 --> 27:45.713
- I hope not dying.
- I apologize.

27:45.714 --> 27:47.983
Of course, I have misunderstood.

27:48.555 --> 27:51.195
The young man is a
student at the University.

27:51.355 --> 27:53.640
- What do you study?
- Medicine.

27:53.675 --> 27:55.456
I'm studying to be a physician.

27:55.636 --> 27:57.356
You'd save your father's life?

27:57.391 --> 28:00.276
Yes. Yes, I hope so...
among others things.

28:06.877 --> 28:09.597
Mr. Haeckel needs more wine, Elise.

28:09.632 --> 28:11.198
Of course.

28:29.640 --> 28:32.040
She is lovely, isn't she?

28:33.480 --> 28:35.806
She is a very charming woman.

28:35.841 --> 28:38.041
Oh, she is much more
than that, Mr. Haeckel.

28:38.881 --> 28:41.641
And it would not inflame me
for you to say so.

28:43.482 --> 28:45.642
I know what you're thinking.

28:45.882 --> 28:49.363
How can I, an old man with a small farm,

28:49.398 --> 28:52.320
deserve this lovely
young lady as a wife?

28:52.355 --> 28:55.043
- I thought nothing of the sort.
- Liar!

28:55.523 --> 28:57.189
Sir, I beg...

28:57.224 --> 29:00.804
I do not take offense.
Let me just say this.

29:01.004 --> 29:05.045
The ways of love are mysterious.

29:16.006 --> 29:18.931
Are you a married man, Mr. Haeckel?

29:18.966 --> 29:21.332
No, sir.
I'm quite unattached.

29:21.367 --> 29:24.487
- Are you in love?
- Not at present.  No.

29:24.522 --> 29:26.727
Have you ever been in love?

29:27.167 --> 29:30.368
I have not had the pleasure...
or the time.

29:30.568 --> 29:31.847
Elise!

29:31.848 --> 29:34.528
The young man has no time for love.

29:36.489 --> 29:38.489
Yes.

29:40.969 --> 29:42.769
Bring us more wine.

29:47.050 --> 29:48.970
And join us.

29:49.370 --> 29:51.456
I believe I've had enough wine.

29:51.491 --> 29:54.731
Nonsense.
It is no substitute for love,

29:54.766 --> 29:57.611
but it will warm you
on a cold wet night.

29:58.851 --> 30:00.932
Right, Elise?

30:03.052 --> 30:05.320
You have never known love?

30:05.427 --> 30:07.933
Only fleetingly, I'm afraid.

30:08.413 --> 30:13.133
Better fleetingly
than not at all, right?

30:16.334 --> 30:20.134
Mr. Haeckel is a fine looking
young man, is he not, Elise?

30:20.654 --> 30:23.615
Yes.
A very handsome man.

30:23.750 --> 30:26.575
The most eligible of bachelors.

30:27.255 --> 30:28.512
A shame.

30:29.013 --> 30:32.534
Surely you have
experienced physical love.

30:32.569 --> 30:34.536
Have you not, Mr. Haeckel?

30:38.177 --> 30:41.317
I'm sorry, sir, but your
question breaches propriety.

30:41.497 --> 30:44.297
Let us just blame it
on the wine, shall we?

30:49.778 --> 30:53.699
I'm feeling very tired, sir.  I should
like to go to bed, if you don't mind.

30:53.734 --> 30:55.844
Of course not.
Elise!

30:55.879 --> 30:57.819
Make up the bed for Mr. Haeckel.

31:00.419 --> 31:02.620
Good night, sir.

31:28.383 --> 31:30.668
I hope you will be comfortable here.

31:30.703 --> 31:33.304
I'm sure I will be.
Thank you.

31:35.064 --> 31:38.724
It's certainly better than
under an old oak tree in the rain.

31:43.185 --> 31:45.085
What are you looking for?

31:48.946 --> 31:51.846
You are such a lovely woman, Elise.

32:00.867 --> 32:02.867
I must go now.

33:56.822 --> 33:58.842
<i>Thank you for coming.</i>

33:58.843 --> 34:00.959
<i>- It's all there.
- Right.</i>

34:41.648 --> 34:44.288
Make sure he has had enough
before you put him down.

34:44.608 --> 34:48.049
I don't want him waking and crying
for you after you are gone.

34:58.970 --> 35:00.650
Why don't you stay?

35:01.130 --> 35:05.711
It's been a foolish year...
and I cannot take it any longer!

35:35.215 --> 35:37.095
Enough.

35:48.016 --> 35:49.537
Mr. Wolfram?

35:50.297 --> 35:52.297
What is it that troubles you?

35:53.097 --> 35:55.937
Well my friend,
I cannot begin to tell you.

35:58.138 --> 36:01.138
Would you prefer that
I leave you alone to your tears?

36:07.819 --> 36:09.184
No!

36:09.219 --> 36:11.660
I do not want you to go out after her.

36:11.695 --> 36:13.260
Now.

36:19.521 --> 36:21.021
The man...

36:21.061 --> 36:23.061
who came to the door.

36:23.741 --> 36:25.281
Who is he?

36:26.001 --> 36:29.142
His name is Montesquino,
Dr. Montesquino.  He is...

36:29.542 --> 36:31.262
an acquaintance.

36:32.462 --> 36:36.263
And...  a friend to your wife?

36:36.343 --> 36:39.703
No!  Is is not what you surmise...

36:41.823 --> 36:44.864
Elise has no interest in the company
of Dr. Montesquino, believe me.

36:44.899 --> 36:46.520
Nor on any visitor in this house.

36:46.524 --> 36:49.024
- Sir, if you mean...
- Do not concern yourself.

36:49.644 --> 36:52.305
I took no offense at the
looks you gave my wife.

36:52.340 --> 36:55.545
How could you not?
She is a beautiful woman.

36:56.225 --> 36:57.985
But let me tell you, my friend.

36:59.066 --> 37:03.626
You... could never... satisfy her.

37:04.146 --> 37:06.827
Neither of course, could I!

37:09.667 --> 37:12.920
When I married her, I was already
too old to be her husband to her...

37:12.923 --> 37:16.068
in the... truest sense.

37:16.508 --> 37:18.308
But you have a child.

37:22.109 --> 37:24.149
The boy...

37:25.169 --> 37:26.869
... is not mine.

37:31.410 --> 37:33.950
And where is the father?

37:34.550 --> 37:38.071
I'm afraid he's dead!

37:40.231 --> 37:42.276
Then you are a very noble man.

37:42.311 --> 37:46.672
I am guilty of many things, but I
have never been accused of nobility.

37:48.032 --> 37:51.552
She still loved her husband.
Still does to this day.

37:52.312 --> 37:55.113
No other man could ever fulfill her.

38:00.233 --> 38:05.034
I've met this Dr. Montesquino.

38:05.594 --> 38:07.759
He claims to be a necromancer.

38:07.794 --> 38:11.515
- The man is a charlatan.
- The esteemed Dr. Montesquino,

38:11.995 --> 38:15.355
... deals in the science which
I do not profess to understand.

38:16.596 --> 38:18.596
But man is not a charlatan.

38:20.756 --> 38:23.000
Have you paid this necromancer?

38:23.016 --> 38:26.277
So that Elise could talk to the
dead man who fathered her child?

38:26.357 --> 38:30.877
And now Montesquino is going to play you
some... miserable trick on the poor Elise!

38:31.012 --> 38:33.798
To make her believe that she is...
talking to a dead spirit.

38:33.833 --> 38:36.478
It is no trick, **.

38:36.598 --> 38:40.344
What the man does is real,
I'm afraid to say.

38:40.379 --> 38:43.539
Which is why you should stay here
until it's over and done with.

38:43.574 --> 38:46.359
It is nothing you should ever...

38:47.200 --> 38:48.760
Listen to her!

38:49.440 --> 38:50.999
Better not...

38:51.000 --> 38:53.920
Well, she is in pain!
I'm going after her.

38:57.661 --> 39:00.161
She still loves him.

39:11.623 --> 39:13.042
Haeckel?

39:13.043 --> 39:15.927
Listen to me, Haeckel.
Elise, she has a sickness.

39:16.028 --> 39:17.480
She had it when I first met her.

39:17.498 --> 39:19.129
What did I know!
I loved her.

39:19.164 --> 39:22.204
I sold everything I had to try to...
to grant her this...

39:22.424 --> 39:24.244
I want to make her happy!

39:26.325 --> 39:29.385
Well, she doesn't sound very happy now.

39:29.445 --> 39:31.670
- No, it's not what you think!
- And what do I think, old man?

39:31.680 --> 39:35.551
You don't know what it is.  And it is...
Oh God!  Please come back to the house!

39:35.586 --> 39:38.406
I said no!  I'll not have
her molested by that man!

39:38.441 --> 39:40.200
- You don't understand.
- Nor do I want to.

39:40.206 --> 39:42.632
We couldn't begin to satisfy her!
Neither of us!

39:42.667 --> 39:45.380
So you hired Montesquino to savage her?

39:45.382 --> 39:47.007
Jesus, man!

39:47.627 --> 39:49.848
Stop!
I'm begging you.

39:50.088 --> 39:51.553
Stay away from the necropolis.

39:51.588 --> 39:55.328
Bastard!
What kind of a husband are you?

40:07.830 --> 40:09.735
I beg you, cease, Mr. Haeckel.

40:09.836 --> 40:12.717
You are stepping into another world
you should never enter!

40:25.252 --> 40:26.792
Good Lord!

40:26.872 --> 40:29.593
I recognize this pitiful cur.

40:30.573 --> 40:32.333
Poor beast.

40:53.576 --> 40:56.596
Put the poor beast out of its misery.

41:15.999 --> 41:19.379
- Die, damn you!
- It is already dead, Haeckel.

41:19.459 --> 41:21.860
- You cannot kill it again.
- That's impossible.

41:21.895 --> 41:25.800
No.  The filthy beast is dead.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.740
So do you see now?

41:29.000 --> 41:32.261
You have no idea of the
horrors that await you here.

41:33.461 --> 41:35.821
All the more reason to go to your wife.

41:35.856 --> 41:38.862
All the more reason to stay away.

41:40.382 --> 41:42.422
What kind of a man are you?

41:42.982 --> 41:44.913
You actually paid this Montesquino

41:44.914 --> 41:47.581
to bring back your wife's
first husband from the dead!

41:48.523 --> 41:50.863
You poor fool!

42:24.308 --> 42:26.108
Give me the musket.

42:37.189 --> 42:38.248
Are you not coming?

42:38.349 --> 42:41.710
I dare not enter the place where
Montesquino performs his dark magic!

42:41.745 --> 42:43.345
So be it.

43:10.914 --> 43:12.554
Elise!

43:23.535 --> 43:25.035
Bastard!

43:25.575 --> 43:29.536
Ah, the young **...  comes
to save the maiden fair, no doubt.

43:29.571 --> 43:31.061
What have you done to her, damn you?

43:31.096 --> 43:34.128
Not to her, young man, for her.

43:34.229 --> 43:36.849
Go.
See for yourself.

44:32.744 --> 44:34.724
I warned you!

44:35.004 --> 44:37.885
- You knew this was happening!
- Of course I knew.

44:38.325 --> 44:41.165
I fear this is the only
way she is satisfied.

44:42.285 --> 44:44.346
What is she?

44:44.381 --> 44:45.971
A woman.

44:46.306 --> 44:48.232
A woman in love with a dead man.

44:53.585 --> 44:56.112
No natural woman could endure that!

44:57.167 --> 44:59.328
- Stop!
- No, Haeckel!

44:59.688 --> 45:02.048
She is not to blame.

45:02.588 --> 45:04.293
Montesquino?

45:04.328 --> 45:08.669
I am not to blame either, sir.
I merely did as I was paid to do.

45:08.704 --> 45:12.349
Whatever you did to start this, undo it.

45:12.549 --> 45:14.609
I cannot, sir.

45:14.809 --> 45:19.930
Make it stop!  I command you,
or I'll shoot you dead!

45:20.050 --> 45:22.130
I cannot!

45:23.511 --> 45:25.191
Do it...

45:26.631 --> 45:28.651
Elise?

45:30.872 --> 45:32.492
Please Elise.

45:34.012 --> 45:36.252
You should come home now.

45:36.812 --> 45:38.213
Elise?

45:38.433 --> 45:40.413
Please come home with me.

45:40.448 --> 45:42.093
Elise!

45:46.054 --> 45:47.934
Elise...

45:58.695 --> 46:00.575
Montesquino?

46:10.597 --> 46:14.637
What does it take to make this stop?
What are the words?

46:14.872 --> 46:16.402
No words.

46:16.437 --> 46:18.118
How do we make it stop?

46:18.958 --> 46:23.363
When the sun... comes up.

46:23.398 --> 46:26.044
- Is there no other way?
- No...

46:26.079 --> 46:29.879
- No other way.
- Tell me, you bastard!

48:44.577 --> 48:46.237
Good morning.

48:48.497 --> 48:52.298
- The storm has passed, hasn't it?
- It has.

48:56.378 --> 48:57.978
Elise?

48:59.378 --> 49:00.779
Yes?

49:01.419 --> 49:05.379
- Last night...
- Hmm.  Last night...

49:06.019 --> 49:08.820
- At the necropolis...
- Yes...

49:08.855 --> 49:11.620
At the necropolis.

49:13.100 --> 49:17.201
- Walter...
- I know... is dead.

49:18.581 --> 49:21.026
He was old...

49:21.061 --> 49:23.382
He was always...

49:24.782 --> 49:27.262
kind to me.

49:28.422 --> 49:31.063
Old men aren't the best husbands.

49:31.098 --> 49:33.376
As long as you don't want children.

49:35.943 --> 49:38.463
This isn't Walter's boy.

49:46.625 --> 49:49.025
He doesn’t look anything like Walter.

49:50.425 --> 49:53.545
But he looks just
like his beautiful daddy.

49:54.346 --> 49:56.466
See?

49:59.046 --> 50:01.186
Would you like to hold him?

50:01.786 --> 50:03.187
Please...

50:04.067 --> 50:07.167
Hold him... please.

51:35.739 --> 51:38.679
And that, my handsome friend,

51:38.879 --> 51:44.668
is how young Ernst Haeckel
finally found the love he sought.

51:45.480 --> 51:47.540
That's the most horrible tale ever told!

51:47.575 --> 51:48.679
Is it?

51:48.680 --> 51:51.261
That the woman would have
carnal knowledge with the dead.

51:51.296 --> 51:55.041
Your story is impossible.
It is an affront to God!

51:55.641 --> 51:57.581
So say you...

51:57.616 --> 51:59.522
Mr. Ralston...

51:59.762 --> 52:03.402
May I assume that you could
not be happy to have your wife

52:03.437 --> 52:05.847
returned under such circumstances.

52:05.882 --> 52:10.923
That you, do not love
your wife that much?

52:10.963 --> 52:13.083
My wife is a spirit.

52:13.884 --> 52:18.504
- Not the body that holds it.
- Just so, kind sir, just so!

52:18.539 --> 52:21.164
I can return the body, but...

52:21.284 --> 52:25.105
I hold no guarantee for the spirit!

52:25.140 --> 52:26.810
***

52:26.845 --> 52:30.006
There is no God in
this simple home, sir.

52:30.366 --> 52:32.566
No God at all...

52:35.806 --> 52:37.587
What is that sound?

52:39.487 --> 52:41.047
What is that horrible sound?

52:41.807 --> 52:44.527
How do you know horrible sound?

52:48.368 --> 52:51.048
How did you come to
know this terrible tale?

52:55.209 --> 53:00.610
Sweet darling!
We were just talking about you.

53:09.611 --> 53:12.296
Montesquino taught me so much...

53:12.331 --> 53:16.252
I should always be deeply in his debt...

53:21.292 --> 53:23.898
Give me, little darling.

53:23.933 --> 53:28.653
Come to mommy, sweetest.
Time for supper!

53:37.014 --> 53:39.615
Oh darling!

53:40.195 --> 53:44.080
Gentlemen ! We have
a very handsome guest,

53:44.115 --> 53:50.136
who claims to love his wife as
much as we love one another.

53:50.976 --> 53:53.257
Mr. Ralston.

54:06.538 --> 54:09.438
You boys can just wait?

54:11.099 --> 54:13.139
Until the baby's fed.

54:17.259 --> 54:20.820
Then we can all...  play.

54:21.900 --> 54:23.780
Together!
