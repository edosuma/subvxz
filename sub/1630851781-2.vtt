a little off one side,

off the other.

20:06.901 --> 20:09.033
That's the idea.

20:09.164 --> 20:10.774
A little more gel and...

20:12.950 --> 20:14.125
[Sunny]
Ta-da!

20:14.256 --> 20:15.823
[gasping]My official entry.

20:15.953 --> 20:17.912
Wow.Whoa...

20:21.394 --> 20:24.962
A topiary
made out of hair?

20:25.093 --> 20:27.008
Incredible.

20:27.138 --> 20:29.402
Sunny, you've invented
a whole new art form.

20:29.532 --> 20:30.794
Well, she did have
a great model.

20:30.925 --> 20:32.361
[giggling]

20:32.492 --> 20:34.450
No doubt about it.

20:34.581 --> 20:37.236
The winner
of the annual contest is...

20:37.366 --> 20:39.716
Oh...

20:39.847 --> 20:43.154
This beautiful Doodle
doggy topi-hairy, by Sunny!

20:43.285 --> 20:45.722
[cheering]

20:45.853 --> 20:47.246
Yay, woo-- Wait.

20:47.376 --> 20:48.725
We lost?
Ugh!

20:48.856 --> 20:52.163
Who wants a silly old
first prize ribbon anyway?

20:52.294 --> 20:54.470
We're taking our topiary
and going.

20:54.601 --> 20:57.299
And by "we," you mean...

20:57.430 --> 20:58.779
I got it this time.

20:58.909 --> 21:00.302
Woof!

21:01.738 --> 21:03.087
Grrr...

21:09.268 --> 21:11.705
This is definitely one
for the style files.

21:11.835 --> 21:14.534
The winning topiary.
I love it.

21:14.664 --> 21:16.057
I'm sure glad
we didn't give up.

21:16.187 --> 21:18.929
Well, you can only win it
if you're in it.

21:19.060 --> 21:21.628
Sunny, do you think you could
turn my hair into a chicken?

21:21.758 --> 21:23.673
And can you do a snowman?

21:23.804 --> 21:25.936
Sunny, can you make me
a topi-hairy?

21:26.067 --> 21:27.590
Oh, yeah, me too.

21:27.721 --> 21:31.420
Yep, a whole new art form.

21:31.551 --> 21:34.293
[chuckling]Yeah-- Whoa!

21:34.423 --> 21:36.251
Huh?Here you go, Sunny.

21:36.382 --> 21:38.906
[all]
Yeah!

21:39.036 --> 21:40.690
[laughing]

21:42.126 --> 21:43.476
Hi, it's me, Sunny,

21:43.606 --> 21:47.088
with another look inside
the style files.

21:47.218 --> 21:52.006
Wow, that is an amazing
topi-hairy hairstyle.

21:52.136 --> 21:55.401
