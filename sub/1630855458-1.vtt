WEBVTT

02:41.122 --> 02:44.212
Bob, what are you doing?
It's 10 o'clock.

02:44.212 --> 02:45.909
Just finishing up
some stuff here.

02:45.909 --> 02:48.260
Get out of here.
Go home.

02:48.260 --> 02:50.697
I will.
Couple more minutes.

02:50.697 --> 02:52.525
Bob, I'm not asking.
I'm telling.

02:52.525 --> 02:54.266
Okay? Go drink some eggnog
or something.

02:54.266 --> 02:56.050
It's Christmas, for Chrissakes.

02:57.269 --> 02:59.619
- Merry Christmas.
- Fuck you!

03:03.492 --> 03:05.320
You don't care!

03:05.320 --> 03:08.715
Stop telling me to calm down!

03:08.715 --> 03:11.065
- Someone's gonna call the cops.
- Good, let them call the cops!

03:11.065 --> 03:13.241
I'll talk to the cops.
They're gonna arrest your ass.

03:13.241 --> 03:15.852
Yeah, you want that to happen?
You know what's going
on with cops?

03:15.852 --> 03:17.289
You know what else
fucking happened?

03:17.289 --> 03:18.899
What?

03:21.162 --> 03:23.730
I want a fucking divorce.

03:23.730 --> 03:25.558
I'm not fucking happy with you.

03:25.558 --> 03:28.125
Oh, don't say shit
I can't come back with.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.215
I hate you, motherfucker.
I hate you.

03:30.215 --> 03:32.304
You don't even give a fuck.

03:32.304 --> 03:34.262
- Just another husband, huh?
- Yeah, just another husband,

03:34.262 --> 03:36.960
just another lying
sack of shit, like you.

03:46.056 --> 03:48.581
Hey.
Ho, ho, ho.

03:48.581 --> 03:50.060
Look out the window.

04:02.421 --> 04:03.770
Hi.

04:03.770 --> 04:05.424
<i>Hey, kid.</i>

04:05.424 --> 04:06.947
How's it going?

04:07.382 --> 04:09.297
<i>Yeah, I'm okay.</i>

04:09.297 --> 04:10.646
What is it?

04:11.343 --> 04:12.735
<i>Nothing.</i>

04:12.735 --> 04:14.084
<i>It's just that I saw</i>

04:14.084 --> 04:15.564
<i>this family today
at the market.</i>

04:15.564 --> 04:18.306
<i>A mother and father and a kid</i>

04:18.306 --> 04:20.961
<i>was riding some dumb
airplane ride.</i>

04:21.527 --> 04:24.878
And then when it was over,
the mother asked the boy,

04:24.878 --> 04:26.793
"What do you want to do now?"

04:27.924 --> 04:30.100
<i>Just like, in that moment,</i>

04:30.100 --> 04:31.624
<i>they could do whatever
they wanted, you know?</i>

04:32.277 --> 04:33.887
<i>As a family.</i>

04:36.237 --> 04:37.282
Yeah.

04:39.196 --> 04:40.894
I told you it was stupid.

04:42.939 --> 04:44.550
Nah, it's not stupid.

04:47.292 --> 04:48.597
How's your mother?

04:49.772 --> 04:51.383
<i>Uh... She's okay.</i>

04:52.166 --> 04:54.777
Well, wish her Merry Christmas
for me, okay?

04:55.430 --> 04:56.910
<i>Yeah, I will.</i>

04:57.476 --> 04:58.912
Goodnight.

04:58.912 --> 05:00.566
<i>Goodnight, sweetheart.</i>

05:15.189 --> 05:16.495
Mom?

05:20.803 --> 05:22.152
Hello?

05:31.379 --> 05:33.468
No!

05:34.382 --> 05:36.036
Cyrus!

05:36.036 --> 05:38.560
Look what I found!

05:39.866 --> 05:41.215
- No! No!
- Look at them.

05:41.215 --> 05:43.304
Look at them now!

05:45.828 --> 05:49.702
No! No! Get off me!

05:49.702 --> 05:51.834
No, no!

06:34.877 --> 06:37.663
♪ Long lay the world

06:38.490 --> 06:40.274
♪ In sin... ♪

06:45.148 --> 06:46.976
One for you, one for you.

06:46.976 --> 06:49.239
All right. Here's one for you.

06:59.075 --> 07:00.381
Arthur?

07:00.381 --> 07:01.861
Arth... Santa!

07:01.861 --> 07:03.340
Have you seen Gabi?

07:05.125 --> 07:06.996
Have you seen Gabi? She was
supposed to meet me here.

07:06.996 --> 07:08.389
Her phone's been busy
all morning.

07:08.389 --> 07:10.217
- You call the house?
- Yeah, house line,

07:10.217 --> 07:11.436
cell, nothing.

07:11.436 --> 07:12.654
Will you drive out
there with me?

07:12.654 --> 07:14.177
You know how she gets,
me just showing up.

07:14.177 --> 07:16.005
Yeah.
Fucking divorces.

07:31.934 --> 07:34.023
Ho, ho, ho.

07:44.730 --> 07:46.949
Sarah!

07:46.949 --> 07:48.777
Gabi! Grandpops.

07:52.607 --> 07:54.479
You don't think they could have
been overcome

07:54.479 --> 07:56.089
by fumes or something?
- Arthur.

07:57.656 --> 07:59.048
Wait out here.

08:05.141 --> 08:06.621
Hello?

08:11.017 --> 08:12.409
Sarah?

08:21.984 --> 08:23.420
Gabi?

08:47.836 --> 08:49.272
Bob!

08:54.582 --> 08:58.064
<i>- The Lord is my shepherd.</i>

08:58.673 --> 09:00.370
I shall not want.

09:01.807 --> 09:04.853
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

09:05.462 --> 09:08.335
He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

09:08.901 --> 09:11.338
He restoreth my soul.

09:11.338 --> 09:15.081
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his namesake.

09:16.822 --> 09:19.476
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

09:19.476 --> 09:21.304
I will fear no evil.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.830
For thou art with me.

09:30.444 --> 09:31.619
What's going on?

09:33.490 --> 09:34.970
Just thinking.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.596
What you reading?

09:53.336 --> 09:56.644
Oh, yeah, I read about that.

10:00.692 --> 10:03.825
But what are you doing sitting
all alone in the dark? Huh?

10:07.960 --> 10:09.962
I breathe better in the dark.

10:11.703 --> 10:13.574
I don't know why.
I just do.

10:21.930 --> 10:23.628
A girl so young.

10:25.238 --> 10:27.196
Yeah, young.

10:27.196 --> 10:29.590
Jesus.

10:29.590 --> 10:31.244
You think she's still alive?

10:32.854 --> 10:34.421
She could be.

10:39.818 --> 10:42.168
But if she is...

10:44.387 --> 10:46.694
...what she's going through
ain't like nothing those sheep

10:46.694 --> 10:48.565
in Clay could even imagine.

10:52.657 --> 10:54.441
You want to go downstairs?

10:55.224 --> 10:58.140
We got some of those Circus
Cookies with the sprinkles.

10:58.140 --> 11:01.100
We could just...
eat a million of 'em.

11:04.843 --> 11:08.020
I'm thinking about writing the
Sheriff's Department in Mint.

12:07.557 --> 12:09.995
Case Hardin?
Bob Hightower.

12:09.995 --> 12:11.257
You wanna?

12:13.128 --> 12:15.174
<i> She's a professional
liar, Bob.</i>

12:15.870 --> 12:18.177
She was in a cult,
for Christ's sake.

12:18.177 --> 12:20.788
Assault with a knife, prostitution,

12:20.788 --> 12:23.095
conspiracy to sell heroin.

12:23.095 --> 12:24.923
You really think this
person is trustworthy?

12:24.923 --> 12:26.838
She says she's got information.

12:26.838 --> 12:28.840
Fine. Bring her in. Sit her
junkie ass across from me.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.319
I'll pay the fucking Uber.
- Come on, John.

12:30.319 --> 12:32.278
People like that aren't
comfortable coming in here.

12:32.278 --> 12:33.845
No shit,
she's not comfortable.

12:33.845 --> 12:35.585
- Please, it's been six weeks.
- Bob.

12:35.585 --> 12:37.196
Six weeks.
We haven't gotten anywhere.

12:37.196 --> 12:38.806
Bob! We're doing
everything we can.

12:38.806 --> 12:40.765
I've let you take all the files
and we run every lead,

12:40.765 --> 12:42.549
no matter what. Haven't I?
It's the right thing to do,

12:42.549 --> 12:44.333
and I wouldn't have it
any other way if I was

12:44.333 --> 12:46.118
in your shoes.
- But this is a lead.

12:46.118 --> 12:48.033
But this type of bitch
knows all the angles.

12:48.033 --> 12:49.774
And you're way out
of your league.

12:49.774 --> 12:51.079
Look, it'd be another thing

12:51.079 --> 12:53.299
if you were an experienced
investigator but...

12:53.995 --> 12:55.083
But what?

12:56.868 --> 12:57.912
Go on, say it.

13:00.175 --> 13:02.047
You're a desk cowboy, Bob.

13:02.047 --> 13:03.788
A seat warmer.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.878
I'm sorry.
You want the truth, there it is.

13:09.532 --> 13:10.751
Yes, sir.

13:18.803 --> 13:20.108
You want coffee?

13:20.892 --> 13:22.850
Yes, thanks. Black.

13:24.852 --> 13:26.593
- I would offer you a beer,

13:26.593 --> 13:29.378
but I'll be on the wagon
for the next 40 or 50 years.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.130
I believe this was
a cult murder.

13:43.131 --> 13:46.134
Not a robbery or any of the
crap you read in the paper.

13:47.309 --> 13:49.268
I have photos from that night.

13:49.268 --> 13:51.966
You could take a look at them
and tell me what you think.

13:54.360 --> 13:55.665
Okay.

14:14.510 --> 14:16.382
Was Gabi into drugs?

14:16.382 --> 14:17.862
No.

14:17.862 --> 14:20.038
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

14:20.038 --> 14:21.517
I know my daughter.

14:22.736 --> 14:26.000
Her friends into satanic
shit of any kind?

14:26.000 --> 14:27.132
Satanic?

14:28.089 --> 14:29.525
She's 14 years old.

14:29.525 --> 14:32.180
Does she look like she hangs
with that kind of crowd?

14:32.180 --> 14:34.791
We live in a small
Christian community.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.272
We don't have much in
the way of deviant behavior.

14:41.755 --> 14:45.063
We all came from
family-oriented communities.

14:45.802 --> 14:47.456
Even me.

15:04.952 --> 15:07.172
Was this man a drug addict?

15:09.043 --> 15:11.263
This is a syringe mark.

15:11.785 --> 15:12.960
Is it?

15:13.613 --> 15:15.397
What about this?

15:17.269 --> 15:19.575
Judgment.
What do you know about it?

15:19.575 --> 15:21.360
Was he injected
with a paralytic?

15:21.360 --> 15:23.753
What do you know
about it? Case?

15:23.753 --> 15:25.538
No, no.
- I need to think.

15:25.538 --> 15:27.540
You gotta tell me
what you know.

15:27.540 --> 15:28.454
No, I can't.

15:29.020 --> 15:30.282
Case.

15:30.282 --> 15:31.718
- No.
- Case. Case, wait.

15:31.718 --> 15:33.372
No, please.
I just need you to go away.

15:33.372 --> 15:34.851
You have to tell me
what you know.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.462
- What's going on?
- You have to go away!

15:36.462 --> 15:38.159
I lost my wife.
I lost my daughter.

15:38.159 --> 15:39.856
You have to tell me
what you know!

15:39.856 --> 15:41.380
That's enough,
Mr. Hightower.

15:43.904 --> 15:45.514
I'm leaving.

15:46.341 --> 15:47.821
What'd you say?

15:49.257 --> 15:50.911
I didn't hear you.

15:52.608 --> 15:53.958
You're what?

15:56.743 --> 15:58.310
I said, I'm leaving.

15:58.310 --> 16:00.529
Oh, yeah. That's what I...

16:00.529 --> 16:02.183
that's what I thought you said.

16:02.183 --> 16:03.576
Ah!

16:05.752 --> 16:08.363
No! Cyrus, Cyrus,
she doesn't--

16:08.363 --> 16:10.104
- Stay out of it.

16:12.454 --> 16:14.717
Anyone else wanna leave?

16:15.196 --> 16:16.328
Huh?

16:19.548 --> 16:22.073
What about you, bitch?
You want to try me again?

16:22.073 --> 16:23.770
I got another boot here.

16:39.525 --> 16:40.700
Fuck you.

17:16.127 --> 17:17.563
Keep it running.

17:39.846 --> 17:41.065
Hey, it's me.

17:43.110 --> 17:45.199
You're not gonna
shoot me, are you?

17:46.766 --> 17:48.768
I wasn't expecting anyone.

17:49.290 --> 17:50.726
What do you want?

17:52.337 --> 17:54.904
I think I know
who took your daughter

17:54.904 --> 17:56.863
and I'm betting she's alive.

17:57.342 --> 17:59.605
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:00.867 --> 18:02.390
The paralytic, the card.

18:03.217 --> 18:05.219
I know this crew's handiwork.

18:05.219 --> 18:08.309
- How?
- Personal experience.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.661
I used to be one.

18:14.489 --> 18:16.535
And you think Gabi's alive?

18:17.144 --> 18:18.754
I do.

18:18.754 --> 18:20.104
All right.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.455
Well, I'm gonna need
a sworn statement,

18:23.455 --> 18:25.283
and that means names,

18:25.283 --> 18:26.675
descriptions
of everyone involved.

18:26.675 --> 18:28.286
Slow down, Bob.

18:29.156 --> 18:31.027
If you think that you're going
to track them down

18:31.027 --> 18:33.378
with the cops or even the FBI,
you can forget about it.

18:33.378 --> 18:35.162
- Forget about it?
- Yeah.

18:35.162 --> 18:38.296
These are the followers
of the Left Handed Path.

18:38.296 --> 18:40.341
The word of the Devil.

18:40.341 --> 18:42.038
What? You think you can
just write down an address

18:42.038 --> 18:43.910
and go round 'em up?

18:43.910 --> 18:46.130
You won't even get close.

18:46.130 --> 18:48.436
And as soon as they see
a bunch of dumb shit cops

18:48.436 --> 18:50.569
sniffing around,
the first thing Cyrus will do

18:50.569 --> 18:52.310
is slit your daughter's throat
and drink her blood.

18:52.310 --> 18:54.486
- Don't fucking say that.
- I know that it's hard.

18:54.486 --> 18:56.140
I know that.

18:56.792 --> 18:58.751
But you gotta hear me
on this, okay?

19:00.579 --> 19:02.494
Forget about the authorities
tracking your daughter down.

19:02.494 --> 19:04.539
It ain't gonna happen.

19:04.539 --> 19:07.499
If you want her back,
you gotta get her yourself.

19:08.239 --> 19:10.154
And lose the Boy Scout uniform.

19:10.154 --> 19:12.156
All right, yeah.
What else?

19:12.156 --> 19:14.158
Get as much cash as you can
and a truck that runs.

19:14.158 --> 19:15.333
- I got one.
- Okay, good,

19:15.333 --> 19:16.986
'cause you and me
are going on the road.

19:18.988 --> 19:21.904
- We are?
- Yeah, you and me, Bob.

19:21.904 --> 19:23.602
I'll be back,
bright and early.

19:23.602 --> 19:25.995
I don't understand.
Where do you fit in?

19:27.780 --> 19:30.174
You think that
you can do this alone?

19:30.957 --> 19:34.395
No offense, but you don't
send out sheep to hunt wolves.

19:44.927 --> 19:46.886
We should reconsider.

19:48.627 --> 19:50.368
This is reckless, son.
And dangerous.

19:50.368 --> 19:52.239
Just leave it alone, Arthur.
I've made my decision.

19:52.239 --> 19:53.632
I'll live with the consequences.

19:53.632 --> 19:55.634
She's such a tramped out
excuse of a thing.

19:55.634 --> 19:57.157
I wouldn't put my faith in that.

19:57.157 --> 19:59.768
Oh, I put my faith in God.
Her, I'm traveling with.

19:59.768 --> 20:01.727
How do you know
she won't sell you out?

20:01.727 --> 20:03.076
- I don't.
- How do you know

20:03.076 --> 20:05.078
she won't rob ya?
- I'm dying inside, Arthur.

20:05.078 --> 20:06.732
Do you understand?

20:06.732 --> 20:09.430
A little bit every day,
but I'm dying.

20:09.430 --> 20:11.867
I might be stupid,
but I'm going.

20:15.828 --> 20:17.395
Give me the keys, I'll drive.

20:35.369 --> 20:37.632
I want you
to know something, miss...

20:37.632 --> 20:40.374
If anything happens
to this man over there,

20:40.374 --> 20:44.291
there is nothing you can say
or do to save your ass from me.

20:44.987 --> 20:47.729
We understand each other?
- Absolutely.

20:47.729 --> 20:50.863
And you know what?
I'm blown away.

20:51.429 --> 20:55.520
As a matter of fact, I'm
a little wet between my legs.

21:02.440 --> 21:03.919
Be careful!

21:13.451 --> 21:14.756
What?

21:14.756 --> 21:16.497
Nothing.

21:16.497 --> 21:18.194
Just thinking,
maybe if you'd had

21:18.194 --> 21:20.240
a stronger moral compass
as a child,

21:20.240 --> 21:22.547
like a religious foundation,

21:22.547 --> 21:24.200
that you'd possibly be

21:24.200 --> 21:25.811
better equipped to deal
with what happened to you.

21:25.811 --> 21:28.204
- You fucking kidding me?
- Well, think about it.

21:28.204 --> 21:32.078
I got snatched, asshole,
just like your little girl.

21:32.078 --> 21:35.255
Right out from underneath
my mother's nose when I was 11.

21:35.255 --> 21:37.344
Ain't got nothing
to do with religion.

21:37.344 --> 21:39.999
I'm sorry. Like I said,
I don't mean to judge.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.479
Yeah, well, too late.

22:13.685 --> 22:17.297
Hi, come here!

22:17.297 --> 22:19.255
Hi, hi.

22:19.255 --> 22:20.822
Oh, my gosh.

22:21.954 --> 22:23.651
Yeah, they remember you.

22:25.305 --> 22:26.437
Ferryman.

22:26.437 --> 22:28.221
You gonna give them
all the love?

22:28.221 --> 22:30.005
Come on, now.

22:30.005 --> 22:32.530
Come on, now.
Come on, now.

22:35.924 --> 22:37.404
Look at you.

22:37.404 --> 22:39.145
Glad to see
you're amongst the living.

22:39.145 --> 22:41.234
That's me,
little miss sunshine.

22:41.234 --> 22:43.105
So, who's that over there?

22:43.105 --> 22:44.498
Oh, that's Bob.

22:44.498 --> 22:47.283
His last name's whatever
you put on his new ID.

22:47.283 --> 22:48.546
Okay, Mr. Bob Whatever.

22:48.546 --> 22:50.243
You got that fucking armor
for me, or what?

22:50.243 --> 22:52.288
I got the whole store
over there for you.

22:52.288 --> 22:54.029
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doing, Robert?

22:55.335 --> 22:56.380
Yeah.

22:58.469 --> 23:00.340
Should we start this ID?

23:00.340 --> 23:01.776
No.

23:01.776 --> 23:03.038
Decal work first.

23:03.038 --> 23:04.823
I want shit with bite.

23:04.823 --> 23:06.477
Well, with that
pasty white skin,

23:06.477 --> 23:08.130
this ink gonna look real nice.

23:08.696 --> 23:09.958
I thought
we were here for guns.

23:09.958 --> 23:11.525
You didn't say anything
about tattoos.

23:11.525 --> 23:13.658
- Yeah, well...
- Yeah, well, what?

23:13.658 --> 23:15.268
Bob, imagine if I showed up

23:15.268 --> 23:17.183
at your little church
looking like this.

23:17.183 --> 23:18.793
You think I'd get
a couple stares?

23:18.793 --> 23:20.316
Well, you're about to show up

23:20.316 --> 23:21.883
to a whole different
type of church, my church.

23:21.883 --> 23:24.495
And believe me,
it's just as bigoted as yours.

23:24.495 --> 23:25.887
Why didn't you tell me before?

23:25.887 --> 23:27.933
I don't like discussing
things more than once.

23:27.933 --> 23:29.195
I don't like surprises.

23:29.195 --> 23:30.675
Then don't be surprised
by anything.

23:30.675 --> 23:33.112
Well, sorry.
I'm not comfortable with it.

23:33.112 --> 23:35.157
- Okay, then.

23:35.593 --> 23:38.378
You can just pull the plug
right now, go our separate ways.

23:38.378 --> 23:40.989
Last time I checked,
I was doing you a favor.

23:40.989 --> 23:42.295
Hey, Bee-Dub.

23:43.252 --> 23:44.732
You up.

23:47.735 --> 23:50.346
Mm-hmm!
Good one now.

23:50.346 --> 23:51.783
What you want?

23:51.783 --> 23:53.872
You want... cursive?

23:53.872 --> 23:55.308
Hieroglyphics?

23:55.308 --> 23:56.744
- Just don't go crazy.
- All right.

24:04.404 --> 24:06.058
So, what do you think,
Bob Whatever?

24:07.189 --> 24:09.627
- It's good.
- Good?

24:09.627 --> 24:12.107
That's some genuine,
stone cold, Left Handed,

24:12.107 --> 24:14.066
black magic shit right there.

24:14.066 --> 24:15.371
It's perfect.

24:15.371 --> 24:17.243
See, you gotta understand...

24:18.636 --> 24:21.769
Great tattoo art doesn't come
from bullshit stencils

24:21.769 --> 24:24.032
like you see in those
dick shop windows.

24:24.032 --> 24:27.819
It has to be drawn
to fit the skin.

24:27.819 --> 24:30.561
In fact, the skin becomes the
flesh, and the flesh becomes it.

24:30.561 --> 24:32.345
It's like a marriage.

24:32.345 --> 24:34.695
Stoned motherfucker
boring you to death?

24:34.695 --> 24:36.436
He's working on it.

24:36.436 --> 24:38.351
Gotta use the head.
Mind if I go inside?

24:38.351 --> 24:39.787
You know where it is.

24:39.787 --> 24:41.485
What am I working on?

25:21.176 --> 25:23.527
- Ying, yang, yang.

25:23.527 --> 25:24.876
Mm-hmm.

25:26.138 --> 25:28.923
Okay. Yang's all out.

25:28.923 --> 25:30.925
I robbed your refrigerator.

25:30.925 --> 25:32.623
Toss 'em again.

25:33.841 --> 25:35.277
Oh, you're not making
the poor motherfucker

25:35.277 --> 25:36.801
throw the coins, are you?

25:36.801 --> 25:38.629
Yes, you gotta get it right.
Come on.

25:39.804 --> 25:41.762
You and your
fortune-telling bullshit.

25:41.762 --> 25:43.198
It's not my bullshit.

25:43.198 --> 25:45.418
He's the one
who throws the coins.

25:45.418 --> 25:46.854
He decides his own destiny.

25:46.854 --> 25:48.160
I'm just here
to report the facts.

25:48.160 --> 25:50.336
Mumbo jumbo fucking cha cha.

25:50.336 --> 25:51.903
It's not mumbo jumbo.
It's synchronicity.

25:51.903 --> 25:54.166
I don't ask the questions.
I don't answer 'em.

25:54.166 --> 25:55.689
Time will tell us all of that.

25:55.689 --> 25:57.430
The coins don't lie.

25:58.083 --> 25:59.867
Let's just get this over with.

25:59.867 --> 26:01.521
No.

26:01.521 --> 26:03.349
Fuck that.
Give me the fucking thing.

26:04.785 --> 26:06.352
- What are you doing?

26:06.352 --> 26:08.136
- One final touch.
- No.

26:08.136 --> 26:10.182
- Come on.
- Hey, no. Not my face.

26:10.182 --> 26:11.792
- Please.
- No fucking way.

26:11.792 --> 26:13.402
What's the matter, Bee-Dub?

26:13.402 --> 26:15.840
You don't want to mess up them
schoolboy good looks?

26:15.840 --> 26:17.537
Come on, daddy.

26:17.537 --> 26:19.321
All my lovers have one.

26:20.540 --> 26:21.628
Fuck.

26:33.771 --> 26:35.555
It's time for the money.

26:35.555 --> 26:36.861
3,000.

26:38.732 --> 26:40.821
- It's five.
- No.

26:40.821 --> 26:43.345
Two shotguns,
four handguns, ammo, ID.

26:43.345 --> 26:45.086
3,000, there's the deal.

26:46.044 --> 26:47.654
He knows.

26:48.612 --> 26:50.657
It's okay,
I'll fucking deal with it.

26:50.657 --> 26:52.485
Just give me the money.
- What if he doesn't deal?

26:52.485 --> 26:55.140
Then I'll take his arm, start
killing the dogs one at a time,

26:55.140 --> 26:56.924
just give me the fucking money.

27:00.232 --> 27:01.712
Wait here, okay?

27:17.031 --> 27:19.512
Let's put this chit-chat
in perspective.

27:21.340 --> 27:22.776
What's with the sheep?

27:24.038 --> 27:26.737
Let's see if that math
adds up.

27:28.303 --> 27:32.699
One plus one equals Cyrus.

27:32.699 --> 27:34.266
Oh, fuck.

27:34.266 --> 27:37.008
12-24-20, right there
in your handiwork.

27:37.008 --> 27:38.836
Look, I swear to God,
I don't give a shit.

27:38.836 --> 27:40.794
But what you doing?
You was on your way

27:40.794 --> 27:43.188
to clearing your own shit up.
Why this? You got a death wish?

27:43.188 --> 27:45.581
Huh? Is that what you got?
'Cause they'll give it to you.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.279
You out.
Leave it alone.

27:47.279 --> 27:48.672
Screw the sheep.

27:49.498 --> 27:51.109
Cyrus too. He's a sheep.

27:51.109 --> 27:54.416
Different breed, but he's a
motherfucking sheep. Leave it.

27:54.416 --> 27:57.071
I thought you gave that whole
bad boy shit up

27:57.071 --> 28:00.031
when you split, but now this?
Let me tell you something, Case.

28:00.031 --> 28:02.511
They will leave your ass behind.

28:02.511 --> 28:03.774
Where is he?

28:09.431 --> 28:10.824
They're on rat patrol.

28:11.825 --> 28:13.174
And the girl?

28:13.174 --> 28:14.654
She with him?

28:14.654 --> 28:16.177
She with them.

28:20.878 --> 28:22.314
Who's the sheep?

28:22.314 --> 28:24.185
Interested third party.

28:24.185 --> 28:27.014
- How interested?
- Blood and bones, baby doll.

28:27.014 --> 28:29.451
It's all crossing overtime now.

28:29.451 --> 28:31.889
Bob, I'm glad
you could join us.

28:31.889 --> 28:34.979
We were just discussing
the... philosophies.

28:34.979 --> 28:37.764
See, my take
on things is that...

28:37.764 --> 28:41.246
selfishness is the key
to survival.

28:42.726 --> 28:44.553
What you think, Bob Whatever?

28:45.380 --> 28:47.600
I think you don't give
a shit what I think.

28:47.600 --> 28:48.993
We all done?

28:51.647 --> 28:52.779
Well?

28:57.436 --> 28:59.220
She was alive two weeks ago.

29:03.790 --> 29:05.096
Yeah.

29:33.124 --> 29:34.690
Tell me about Cyrus.

29:34.690 --> 29:37.041
I want to get a read on him.
Well, what's his story?

29:37.041 --> 29:39.086
- His story?
- Yeah. What?

29:39.086 --> 29:40.871
You got someplace else to be?

29:40.871 --> 29:43.264
I mean, we're stuck in this
fucking car for hours.

29:46.833 --> 29:52.621
Really fucked up as a kid,
bad junkie, thief, prostitute.

29:52.621 --> 29:57.061
He sold his ass to pay for his
bad habit, that sort of shit.

29:57.061 --> 29:59.715
But then...
- But what?

30:00.281 --> 30:02.414
Somewhere along the line,
something changed.

30:02.414 --> 30:04.590
I don't know the reason.

30:04.590 --> 30:06.635
But whatever it was,
he found the Left Handed Path,

30:06.635 --> 30:07.985
and that was it.

30:07.985 --> 30:10.509
It anchored him,

30:10.509 --> 30:12.163
like those freaks
that find Jesus.

30:13.294 --> 30:14.730
Excuse me.

30:14.730 --> 30:17.037
My ex-wife was butchered
by this piece of shit.

30:17.037 --> 30:18.865
So if you wouldn't mind
not comparing

30:18.865 --> 30:21.737
his satanical bullshit
to someone believing
in Jesus Christ.

30:21.737 --> 30:24.044
Hey, you asked.
Pick your fucking poison.

30:24.044 --> 30:25.959
No. Religion isn't secular.
It's pure.

30:25.959 --> 30:27.265
- Woo!
- It's the unmoved truth

30:27.265 --> 30:29.310
that all principles
spin out from.

30:29.310 --> 30:31.182
You're a real clit dryer, Bob.
You know that?

30:31.182 --> 30:34.359
Wow, that motherfucker
cooked your head pretty good,
didn't he?

30:34.359 --> 30:36.883
I wouldn't use the word
"pretty" and I wouldn't use
the word "good".

30:36.883 --> 30:38.493
Do not give a fuck about you.

30:38.493 --> 30:41.322
Cleaned up his act, kept
all his troops junkies.

30:41.322 --> 30:43.455
- No, the truth's much worse.
- Yeah?

30:43.455 --> 30:47.459
Once upon a time, I was a
disease just waiting to happen.

30:48.286 --> 30:50.941
I found a ringmaster
with a magic needle.

30:50.941 --> 30:53.247
And I bowed before that needle.

30:54.118 --> 30:57.991
When I got low enough,
I made a god out of it.

30:59.123 --> 31:02.561
The Devil's only an idea, Bob,
an excuse for evil,

31:02.561 --> 31:04.911
just as your god
is an excuse for good.

31:04.911 --> 31:06.478
They're concepts.

31:06.478 --> 31:08.480
They're the needles
just waiting for people

31:08.480 --> 31:10.264
like you and me to stick 'em in.

31:10.264 --> 31:13.441
- That's real deep. I mean, wow.

31:13.441 --> 31:15.052
You know what?
I'll tell you what.

31:15.052 --> 31:16.967
I'll keep my faith.

31:16.967 --> 31:20.535
You can keep the rest
of whatever the fuck it is
you're talking about.

31:43.907 --> 31:46.692
What made you finally
decide to leave?

31:46.692 --> 31:50.043
Cyrus, the group?
I mean, what made you take off?

33:17.087 --> 33:19.872
- Mama?
- Stop!

33:19.872 --> 33:22.788
What?
Why are you following me?

33:22.788 --> 33:24.659
Hey! Hey!

33:24.659 --> 33:27.053
You mind your fucking business,
you fat fucking cunt!

33:27.053 --> 33:29.229
I'll slit your fucking throat!

33:38.412 --> 33:41.633
Uh... A woman in a store.

33:43.722 --> 33:44.940
So stupid.

33:44.940 --> 33:47.204
Didn't even look like her.

33:47.769 --> 33:49.423
I didn't even know
what I would have done

33:49.423 --> 33:52.557
if it was actually her
or what I would've said.

33:54.124 --> 33:57.083
Hey, Mom.
How's it going?

33:57.083 --> 33:59.955
How have the last dozen
fucking years been?

34:00.869 --> 34:03.394
Maybe I would have asked what
I was like when I was younger

34:03.394 --> 34:07.485
because I don't
fucking remember. Or...

34:07.485 --> 34:09.530
You know,
when she stopped looking,

34:09.530 --> 34:11.358
like, what the fuck happened?

34:14.013 --> 34:15.797
You ever find out
what happened to her?

34:15.797 --> 34:17.408
Does she even know you're alive?

34:17.408 --> 34:19.105
No. I... I don't know.

34:19.105 --> 34:20.976
I don't even know
if I'd want her to.

34:20.976 --> 34:23.805
- Well, why not?
- Because I don't.

34:23.805 --> 34:26.069
All right?
It's been a dozen fucking years.

34:26.069 --> 34:27.244
And what's with
all the questions?

34:27.244 --> 34:28.636
Okay, okay.

34:28.636 --> 34:29.942
Mind your own
fucking business.

34:29.942 --> 34:31.987
- All right.
- Can we get the check, please?

34:51.006 --> 34:53.487
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:53.487 --> 34:55.837
The prodigal daughter returns.

34:56.490 --> 34:58.536
And who's this?
A new member of the family?

34:58.536 --> 35:01.060
This is Bob.
Bob, this is Errol.

35:01.060 --> 35:04.803
What are you doing
here, Headcase?

35:04.803 --> 35:08.023
Well, we were having dinner
in Nogales

35:08.023 --> 35:09.764
and I remembered your bar.

35:09.764 --> 35:12.985
So I thought, why not
come by and say hello?

35:16.380 --> 35:18.860
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

35:19.470 --> 35:21.776
I'm glad to see you
couldn't make it.

35:24.736 --> 35:26.041
I'm leaving.

35:26.694 --> 35:28.174
Right?

35:31.221 --> 35:34.224
Hey! Hey!

35:34.224 --> 35:36.922
Bob! Bob, stop!

35:36.922 --> 35:38.793
Fucking piece of work,
you know that?

35:38.793 --> 35:40.708
- Bet your ass.
- Clean and sober, huh?

35:40.708 --> 35:42.101
When'd you start using?

35:42.101 --> 35:44.495
When did I start keeping
my sleeves down, huh?

35:44.495 --> 35:46.366
- I don't give a shit.
- You don't fucking know.

35:46.366 --> 35:48.194
Do you?
- Leave me alone. Just shut up!

35:48.194 --> 35:50.196
100 fucking degrees in that
shit locker restaurant,

35:50.196 --> 35:52.111
I've got my sleeves tucked
in my fucking hands.

35:52.111 --> 35:53.895
Fucking stooge.

35:55.462 --> 35:57.682
You want to fucking know
what's going on, huh?

35:59.640 --> 36:01.468
- Oh.
- Fucking, listen and learn,

36:01.468 --> 36:03.514
desk boy.
- Don't fucking...

36:06.299 --> 36:08.780
Powder? Vitamin C.

36:09.694 --> 36:11.130
Liquid cleaner.

36:18.093 --> 36:20.835
Looks bad, scabs up nice.

36:20.835 --> 36:22.663
No one but a fucking moron
would believe

36:22.663 --> 36:25.013
that I'm a shooter without
checking me out first,

36:25.013 --> 36:28.408
especially with an albatross
like you hanging around my neck.

36:29.844 --> 36:31.150
Happy?

36:33.326 --> 36:35.154
You don't trust me?
We're supposed to be
a fucking team.

36:35.154 --> 36:37.374
Not a team. I'm the one
who's finding your daughter.

36:37.374 --> 36:38.853
You don't need to know shit.

36:38.853 --> 36:40.507
Better off staying stupid.

36:40.507 --> 36:41.943
Perfect.

36:58.046 --> 36:59.526
Listen...
- Forget it, Bob.

36:59.526 --> 37:02.268
You're strictly
the missionary position.

37:02.268 --> 37:04.662
You lie to me to get me
to react a certain way,

37:04.662 --> 37:06.185
then hold the--
- The missionary position

37:06.185 --> 37:07.317
and not a trick more.

37:07.317 --> 37:09.362
Is that a slogan
or just pure venom?

37:09.362 --> 37:11.321
'Cause the last time I looked--
- Last time you looked

37:11.321 --> 37:13.279
would just be that, the last
time you fucking looked!

37:13.279 --> 37:14.976
I'm looking at you!

37:14.976 --> 37:18.589
The banality of your cheap
whore tricks, the lies.

37:18.589 --> 37:19.894
- Fuck you!
- No, no, you don't

37:19.894 --> 37:21.374
fucking fool me.
You think you fool me?

37:21.374 --> 37:23.637
I know why you're here.
I'm gonna help him get her back,

37:23.637 --> 37:27.206
otherwise, if we get too close,
Cyrus'll kill her quick.

37:27.206 --> 37:29.556
What? You think your therapist
wouldn't tell me?

37:30.209 --> 37:31.732
I did say that.

37:33.343 --> 37:34.692
I just thought...

37:35.997 --> 37:38.304
If she had to go through
what I did.

37:38.304 --> 37:39.523
Just save it.

37:40.088 --> 37:41.786
I can imagine it all.

37:49.968 --> 37:53.101
Errol said Cyrus is coming.

37:55.452 --> 37:56.540
When?

37:58.237 --> 38:00.195
A few days, a week.

38:01.414 --> 38:03.286
He doesn't know,
but he's coming.

38:04.939 --> 38:08.203
And Errol's gonna arrange
a little homecoming for me.

38:27.527 --> 38:29.094
I'm going.

38:29.094 --> 38:31.139
Can't stand
this room any longer.

38:41.541 --> 38:43.108
Where's Errol?

38:44.283 --> 38:46.633
Maybe still
at Maquila.

38:46.633 --> 38:48.983
Oh. Tequila, please.

39:03.346 --> 39:05.435
Nice fucking artwork, man.

39:07.393 --> 39:09.264
I mean it.

39:09.264 --> 39:11.658
Fucking deluxe shit
you got there.

39:12.572 --> 39:14.357
Thanks.

39:20.798 --> 39:22.539
What the fuck, man?

39:22.539 --> 39:24.628
Gutter's waiting.
Time to move.

40:06.365 --> 40:07.584
Hey!

40:24.427 --> 40:26.603
He's close, isn't he?

40:26.603 --> 40:28.779
Fucking black magic.

40:31.651 --> 40:32.957
Oh, fuck.

40:32.957 --> 40:35.089
If they cross, we're fucked.

40:35.089 --> 40:36.787
We're fucked,
but we're crossing.

40:42.227 --> 40:43.707
What about the guns?

40:43.707 --> 40:45.448
Don't worry about it. Go.

41:37.761 --> 41:39.719
Hello, sheep.

42:45.176 --> 42:46.438
Ah!

43:44.409 --> 43:46.063
Well, well.

43:46.063 --> 43:47.455
Hello.

43:50.328 --> 43:52.460
I want to come home.

43:52.460 --> 43:53.461
Ah!

43:58.205 --> 44:00.120
What?

44:00.120 --> 44:01.948
You said you wanted
a little blood.

44:26.973 --> 44:28.627
Okay.

45:03.314 --> 45:04.445
It's okay.

45:24.248 --> 45:26.729
We all wanna come home
in the end, don't we?

45:31.777 --> 45:33.953
But how much is it worth to you?

45:36.564 --> 45:38.610
It's worth everything.

45:40.873 --> 45:42.440
Good answer.

45:47.184 --> 45:49.142
Okay, load her up.

46:14.167 --> 46:16.300
That's my girl.

46:23.829 --> 46:26.963
You know what the real
equalizers in life are?

46:29.095 --> 46:30.880
Suffering and death.

46:32.142 --> 46:33.752
Everything else is daycare.

46:33.752 --> 46:36.276
But suffering and death?

46:36.276 --> 46:37.843
They lay it out pretty fast

46:37.843 --> 46:39.976
when it comes
to who you really are.

46:43.980 --> 46:46.939
How do I know I can trust
you coming home?

46:49.072 --> 46:51.639
How do I know you're not
trying to fuck me?

46:56.862 --> 46:58.995
Maybe you don't love me anymore.

47:00.039 --> 47:02.128
You bring a pistol?

47:02.128 --> 47:05.001
Maybe you wanna punch
a few holes in the messenger.

47:06.132 --> 47:07.699
No.

47:09.440 --> 47:10.963
I don't know.

47:10.963 --> 47:13.487
People play all sorts of games.

47:14.880 --> 47:17.448
Know what I mean, Errol?
- What?

47:17.448 --> 47:19.058
You like games.

47:19.058 --> 47:21.060
Don't ya, chief?

47:21.060 --> 47:24.237
Uh...

47:24.237 --> 47:25.891
Yeah, I don't know.

47:25.891 --> 47:28.372
I don't even know what
the fuck you're talking about.

47:28.372 --> 47:30.940
Sure you do, Mr. Firewater,

47:30.940 --> 47:34.334
Mr. Fucking Yuppie Redskin Phony
who changed his name

47:34.334 --> 47:37.250
so nobody would know
he was a piece of shit
from the reservation.

47:38.686 --> 47:42.908
I mean, I'm half Cherokee,
but the fuck?

47:42.908 --> 47:46.259
How do I know you and the dead
one aren't in this together?

47:46.259 --> 47:49.001
- Come on.
- How do I know?!

47:52.526 --> 47:56.269
I'm not buying into this shit.

47:57.357 --> 47:59.055
Nuh-uh.

47:59.055 --> 48:00.708
Goddamn it.

48:00.708 --> 48:04.451
You don't even fucking believe
what you're saying.

48:04.451 --> 48:05.626
Huh?

48:07.454 --> 48:11.589
I don't travel with protection.

48:11.589 --> 48:14.635
I don't need
a fucking weapon. Right?

48:14.635 --> 48:17.160
I don't scam anybody.

48:17.160 --> 48:19.510
I don't screw anybody.

48:19.510 --> 48:25.168
And if I did, would I use
fucking Headcase?

48:25.168 --> 48:27.213
Fuck no!

48:28.911 --> 48:30.956
Jesus Christ!

48:30.956 --> 48:33.306
This isn't fucking funny, man.

48:33.306 --> 48:35.395
Oh, fuck.

48:35.395 --> 48:37.223
It's time you wore
your death mask.

48:37.223 --> 48:39.878
The fuck are you doing? Shit!

48:39.878 --> 48:41.575
The fuck!

48:43.012 --> 48:45.101
Jesus Christ!

48:45.840 --> 48:48.321
- Put on some music.
- Music?

48:48.321 --> 48:51.672
Cyrus, I'm your fucking partner!
You don't get it.

48:51.672 --> 48:53.239
- Louder! Yeah!

48:53.239 --> 48:55.328
Cyrus, I'm your fucking boy!

48:55.328 --> 48:57.374
What the fuck is this?
- Yeah, that's it.

48:58.070 --> 49:02.640
We need blood to preserve
the youth of America.

49:04.381 --> 49:06.339
Go to it, sister.

49:37.370 --> 49:40.634
This is not funny!
This is not a fucking joke!

49:44.464 --> 49:47.032
I have fucking anxiety!

49:47.032 --> 49:50.035
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

49:50.035 --> 49:51.950
Oh, my God!

49:51.950 --> 49:54.474
Fuck! What the fuck!

50:07.792 --> 50:09.402
Shoot him!

50:10.055 --> 50:11.622
Shoot him!

50:12.144 --> 50:14.625
No, no, no, no, no!

50:52.358 --> 50:54.534
Have you seen
<i>mujer blanco?</i>

50:54.534 --> 50:55.622
No?

50:55.622 --> 50:56.710
Hey!

50:57.320 --> 50:58.712
<i>Mujer blanco?</i>

50:59.626 --> 51:02.281
Hey! <i>Mujer blanco?</i>

51:09.680 --> 51:11.334
<i>Mujer blanco?</i>

51:11.334 --> 51:13.814
No? You're wearing
her fucking jacket.

51:13.814 --> 51:15.381
Where is she? Where?

51:15.381 --> 51:16.817
Okay, we go.

51:18.689 --> 51:19.907
Where?

52:25.973 --> 52:28.193
Get off her. Sit down.
Sit the fuck down!

52:29.499 --> 52:31.240
What do you want?

52:36.070 --> 52:38.247
Case? Case, can you stand up?

52:39.509 --> 52:41.032
We need to get outta here.

52:41.032 --> 52:42.555
Put your arms around me.

53:05.926 --> 53:07.101
No, I don't...

53:09.974 --> 53:11.541
Come on, man.

54:01.547 --> 54:03.462
You gotta pull over.

54:05.072 --> 54:07.292
I gotta visit some old witches.

54:29.096 --> 54:31.925
Yeah, fuck me is right.

54:35.973 --> 54:37.409
You all right?

54:46.984 --> 54:48.594
I had him.

54:50.030 --> 54:51.728
I fucking had him.

54:53.556 --> 54:56.341
I should've killed him
when I had the chance.

54:56.776 --> 54:58.300
Don't worry about it.

54:59.518 --> 55:01.303
Wouldn't get us
where we need to go.

55:04.306 --> 55:05.350
Come on.

55:27.198 --> 55:29.243
We're not gonna find
him here, are we?

55:30.636 --> 55:31.811
No.

55:34.118 --> 55:36.338
But he's going
to the Mojave next.

55:41.125 --> 55:45.738
Last night, when I was looking
for you, no one spoke English.

55:45.738 --> 55:46.783
I didn't understand anyone.

55:50.221 --> 55:54.878
For some reason,
Sam came to my mind.

55:56.009 --> 55:57.141
Who?

55:57.881 --> 55:59.578
My ex-wife's husband.

56:02.320 --> 56:03.887
I always thought
she married him

56:03.887 --> 56:06.193
in part because he was Black.

56:07.238 --> 56:10.197
Point out the differences
between us.

56:17.379 --> 56:20.512
Thinking about that says
an awful lot about who I am.

56:25.517 --> 56:28.390
I'm not sure it's the man
I set out to be.

56:32.394 --> 56:35.701
I thought I had it all
figured out, I really did.

56:36.615 --> 56:39.139
That the universe
was bound together

56:39.139 --> 56:42.055
by all the beautiful things
I believed in.

56:44.710 --> 56:46.103
Come.

56:47.191 --> 56:49.323
Lie down.

56:52.501 --> 56:54.067
But I was wrong.

56:59.551 --> 57:00.683
Come on.

57:01.988 --> 57:04.513
You need to rest your brain.

57:50.167 --> 57:52.343
Don't beat yourself up.

57:55.041 --> 57:57.304
You're doing
what you need to do.

58:03.963 --> 58:10.883
The thing is, we're all
fucked up and wrong...

58:14.974 --> 58:17.586
...trying to hide all the shit
that's broken.

58:37.736 --> 58:40.434
If I were to be truly
straight with you...

58:48.965 --> 58:51.707
When I first came out,
you know...

58:54.971 --> 58:57.451
It wasn't just about revenge...

58:59.976 --> 59:01.673
...helping you.

59:20.518 --> 59:22.476
But you were right.

59:29.048 --> 59:31.660
Cyrus didn't
give a shit about me.

59:38.318 --> 59:40.494
I was nothing to him.

59:53.072 --> 59:55.031
No going home, I guess.

01:00:07.609 --> 01:00:10.089
I'm sorry you had
to kill someone.

01:00:13.266 --> 01:00:15.094
I'm sorry it was over me.

01:00:20.578 --> 01:00:22.362
It's funny the things we...

01:00:25.627 --> 01:00:28.151
...we tell ourselves
without saying anything.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.633
The agreements we make.

01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:34.026
Yeah.

01:00:37.639 --> 01:00:39.728
I'm sorry you had to suffer.

01:00:41.599 --> 01:00:43.035
It's all right.

01:00:46.038 --> 01:00:47.997
My body they had.

01:00:50.086 --> 01:00:52.305
The rest they'll never find.

01:02:56.778 --> 01:02:58.344
I've been thinking.

01:03:03.001 --> 01:03:06.396
Might have to accept the fact
that Gabi's already dead.

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:14.143
Either way, we gotta find out.

01:03:14.143 --> 01:03:15.753
Can't give up.

01:03:15.753 --> 01:03:19.104
No, no, she's my little girl.
You know?

01:03:29.071 --> 01:03:31.638
I used to believe that my faith
protected me,

01:03:31.638 --> 01:03:34.903
that every action of the soul
was meaningful. I really did.

01:03:35.904 --> 01:03:40.909
That we're more than just
flesh, bone, molecules.

01:03:40.909 --> 01:03:46.392
That God was good
and everything would work out.

01:03:50.135 --> 01:03:51.920
What am I talking about?

01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:57.229
You don't believe
in any of that, do you?

01:03:59.144 --> 01:04:01.364
No, Coyote, I don't.

01:04:02.713 --> 01:04:06.369
I think we all know
what life is really about.

01:04:07.152 --> 01:04:10.503
We're just not ready
to accept the bad news.

01:04:12.505 --> 01:04:14.681
So we fight it with God
and the Devil

01:04:14.681 --> 01:04:16.727
and all this New Age bullshit.

01:04:17.902 --> 01:04:20.296
Everyone needs a club, right?

01:04:20.296 --> 01:04:22.820
Club God or Club Scream.

01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:24.474
Take your pick.

01:04:27.042 --> 01:04:28.913
When it comes down to it,

01:04:28.913 --> 01:04:31.916
we all know that it's X amount
of years and then the ground.

01:04:46.757 --> 01:04:48.411
Take a look.

01:04:50.848 --> 01:04:55.809
This is the ultimate life form,
the great equalizer.

01:04:56.506 --> 01:05:01.424
It has no ties,
plays no favorites.

01:05:02.425 --> 01:05:04.906
All life falls before it.

01:05:06.559 --> 01:05:08.605
It's as simple and profound

01:05:08.605 --> 01:05:11.216
as any parable the Bible
could slop up.

01:05:16.961 --> 01:05:19.311
This is God, Coyote.

01:05:20.704 --> 01:05:22.401
Grin and bear it.

01:05:40.506 --> 01:05:42.334
Gonna get a cigarette.

01:06:44.788 --> 01:06:46.007
Bob!

01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:35.969
You're gonna tell us.

01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:38.972
Where's my daughter?

01:07:43.934 --> 01:07:45.022
Bob?

01:07:49.374 --> 01:07:51.072
Bob.

01:07:54.379 --> 01:07:55.902
Fuck.

01:07:58.905 --> 01:08:01.082
Granny, you gotta tell us.

01:08:02.083 --> 01:08:03.910
Is the girl still alive?

01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:07.218
Come and get me, cunt.

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:09.873
You're crossing over.

01:08:37.683 --> 01:08:39.120
What happened?

01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:58.139
Okay, Bob Whatever.

01:08:58.791 --> 01:09:00.184
I'm gonna play
a little medic, okay?

01:09:00.184 --> 01:09:02.839
Going to do a little memory time
on the late night river.

01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:09.193
All that catch-dogging
got those nerve endings
burnt up pretty bad.

01:09:09.193 --> 01:09:12.762
Heart is all over the place.
You going to go into shock soon.

01:09:13.415 --> 01:09:16.374
Or you could die from the horse
protein I'm gonna give you.

01:09:17.114 --> 01:09:19.595
Can you hear me?
- I'm thirsty.

01:09:19.595 --> 01:09:22.163
- What?
- I'm real thirsty.

01:09:22.163 --> 01:09:25.427
Okay. You should have let me
finish throwing them coins.

01:09:26.297 --> 01:09:29.213
You might be dead already
and we just wasting time.

01:09:40.572 --> 01:09:42.487
I'm gonna give you
a little fun juice.

01:09:44.228 --> 01:09:46.709
So, whatever trip you make,

01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:49.407
I'm gonna make it a little more
enjoyable for you now.

01:10:05.902 --> 01:10:07.643
You think he's gonna make it?

01:10:08.426 --> 01:10:09.645
Maybe.

01:10:11.299 --> 01:10:13.257
But if I was a betting man...

01:10:14.389 --> 01:10:16.565
I'd say we're looking
at a dead man.

01:10:23.963 --> 01:10:25.835
<i> How you feeling?</i>

01:10:25.835 --> 01:10:27.184
<i>You know...</i>

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:29.491
<i>I love you.</i>

01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:31.144
<i>I love you, Gabi.</i>

01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:33.408
<i>You're gonna be okay, sweetheart.</i>

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.063
<i>You're gonna be okay.</i>

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.892
Is it better?
Do you feel it?

01:10:39.892 --> 01:10:42.504
Yeah, that's good.

01:10:44.897 --> 01:10:46.029
Now...

01:10:49.075 --> 01:10:50.294
It's gonna be okay.

01:10:50.294 --> 01:10:51.556
<i>It's okay.</i>

01:10:51.556 --> 01:10:53.950
It's okay. Breathe.

01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:56.605
You gotta breathe. Please.

01:10:58.694 --> 01:11:00.304
You take her.

01:11:00.304 --> 01:11:02.175
You promise me, right?
- Okay.

01:11:02.175 --> 01:11:05.962
- If she's alive, you, you--
- Sure. Sure, I can.

01:11:05.962 --> 01:11:09.748
You're the only one I trust.
You take her.

01:11:09.748 --> 01:11:13.012
You promise me. Promise me!

01:11:14.927 --> 01:11:16.842
- Yes, I promise.
- Hmm!

01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:01.626
Alive, huh?

01:12:03.628 --> 01:12:05.326
Yeah, looks like it.

01:12:13.116 --> 01:12:15.031
Are you thirsty?

01:12:15.945 --> 01:12:17.076
Yeah.

01:13:21.097 --> 01:13:23.534
I'm glad you made it, Coyote.

01:14:05.315 --> 01:14:06.751
What's going on?

01:14:06.751 --> 01:14:08.536
Cyrus called.

01:14:08.536 --> 01:14:10.233
We let you sleep.

01:14:10.233 --> 01:14:11.756
What's this?

01:14:12.148 --> 01:14:14.150
It's <i>bon voyage,</i> Bee-Dub.

01:14:14.672 --> 01:14:15.847
Means get the fuck out.

01:14:24.595 --> 01:14:25.814
You ready?

01:14:28.512 --> 01:14:29.557
I'm ready.

01:15:20.608 --> 01:15:22.566
Not even a kiss hello?

01:15:34.926 --> 01:15:36.406
I'm sorry about Mexico.

01:15:36.406 --> 01:15:38.277
- It's all right.
- I tried to stop him, Case.

01:15:38.277 --> 01:15:39.801
Just forget about it.

01:15:43.152 --> 01:15:44.545
Okay.

01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:53.031
Is that the boy toy?

01:16:00.169 --> 01:16:01.866
Got the shit with you?

01:16:01.866 --> 01:16:03.564
It's in the back.

01:16:03.564 --> 01:16:05.087
So where are we going?

01:16:06.610 --> 01:16:08.177
Take 14 South.

01:16:08.177 --> 01:16:09.265
To where?

01:16:11.615 --> 01:16:14.662
You know, you and I don't have
to not get along, you know?

01:16:14.662 --> 01:16:16.446
We ain't gonna be around
each other long enough

01:16:16.446 --> 01:16:18.013
for one way or the other, sheep.

01:16:18.013 --> 01:16:19.797
Just take fucking 14 South.

01:16:36.074 --> 01:16:38.773
Hey, give me my phone.
Case, give me my phone.

01:16:38.773 --> 01:16:40.470
- Sit the fuck down.
- Are you kidding me?

01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:42.907
I said sit the fuck down!

01:16:42.907 --> 01:16:44.648
Give me my fucking phone!

01:16:45.518 --> 01:16:46.781
- It's me.
<i>- Oh.</i>

01:16:46.781 --> 01:16:47.956
Shut the fuck up.

01:16:47.956 --> 01:16:49.610
<i>Hello, debased one.</i>

01:16:49.610 --> 01:16:51.481
<i>Have you come home
to be swallowed?</i>

01:16:51.481 --> 01:16:52.743
Yes.

01:16:52.743 --> 01:16:55.441
Well then, go see Errol.
Get my money.

01:16:55.441 --> 01:16:58.444
Come on, Cyrus.
We know that you're on to us.

01:16:59.968 --> 01:17:02.579
Lena told us everything.
- No, I fucking didn't!

01:17:02.579 --> 01:17:05.277
No, I fucking didn't!
They're fucking lying!

01:17:06.670 --> 01:17:09.281
Cyrus, I didn't say
fucking anything!

01:17:09.281 --> 01:17:11.762
I didn't say anything! Help!

01:17:11.762 --> 01:17:13.329
Fuck you!

01:17:16.462 --> 01:17:18.464
<i>I don't care.</i>

01:17:18.464 --> 01:17:20.336
Get my money from Errol.

01:17:20.336 --> 01:17:21.903
What money?

01:17:21.903 --> 01:17:24.209
<i>I told Errol the product
would be delivered tonight</i>

01:17:24.209 --> 01:17:25.820
<i>and to have my money ready.</i>

01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:27.996
<i>One hundred thousand dollars.</i>

01:17:27.996 --> 01:17:30.520
But we don't have your stuff.
We don't have anything.

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:33.218
Then I'd say you've got
a big fucking problem.

01:17:33.218 --> 01:17:36.744
<i>Sundown, Energy road.
See you there.</i>

01:17:37.266 --> 01:17:39.007
But, how?
What do we trade with?

01:17:39.007 --> 01:17:41.313
<i>I don't know.
Your lives, I guess.</i>

01:17:51.715 --> 01:17:54.500
- He wants us to kill Errol.
- What?

01:17:55.153 --> 01:17:56.764
Take the money.

01:17:56.764 --> 01:17:58.679
Errol's waiting to make a trade.

01:17:58.679 --> 01:18:00.942
We bring Cyrus the money,
he gives us the girl.

01:18:00.942 --> 01:18:03.118
You fucking killed me, Casey.

01:18:03.118 --> 01:18:06.077
You fucking killed me.
I can never go back now.

01:18:06.077 --> 01:18:09.777
Is that why you didn't
fucking let this fucking
sheep do it to me?

01:18:09.777 --> 01:18:11.343
You fucking could.
- Lena...

01:18:11.343 --> 01:18:12.954
No, fuck you!
I'm fucking dead!

01:18:12.954 --> 01:18:14.564
I have no fucking where to go.

01:18:14.564 --> 01:18:16.566
- That's not our problem.
- Fuck you, sheep!

01:18:16.566 --> 01:18:17.785
- Hey.
- Fuck you!

01:18:17.785 --> 01:18:19.003
Hey, you could help us.

01:18:19.003 --> 01:18:21.484
Fuck you too, then!
I ain't doing it!

01:18:21.484 --> 01:18:22.920
You don't have
a fucking choice!

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:25.183
You're out on the street
with a bullseye on your back!

01:18:25.183 --> 01:18:26.968
Who the fuck are you, Case?

01:18:26.968 --> 01:18:29.361
- That's it. Enough. Get out.
- Who the fuck are you?

01:18:29.361 --> 01:18:31.712
You fucking get the fuck out.

01:18:31.712 --> 01:18:34.149
No! Casey, you fucking tell him.

01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:36.020
- Hey! Come on.
- You know I didn't!

01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:38.762
No! No!

01:18:38.762 --> 01:18:39.894
No, Casey!

01:18:39.894 --> 01:18:41.417
You fucking tell him!

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:43.332
No! Casey!

01:18:43.332 --> 01:18:44.768
No!

01:18:46.988 --> 01:18:49.599
- What the fuck.
- Fucking leave it.

01:18:50.034 --> 01:18:52.689
Fuck you!

01:18:52.689 --> 01:18:54.996
You fucking traitor!

01:18:54.996 --> 01:18:56.954
You fucking sheep!

01:18:56.954 --> 01:18:58.651
You're the fucking sheep!

01:19:03.352 --> 01:19:05.789
Fuck you!

01:19:05.789 --> 01:19:07.356
Fuck you!

01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:14.406
Fuck you looking at, pervert?

01:19:40.650 --> 01:19:41.738
Hey.

01:19:42.695 --> 01:19:44.088
Hey.

01:19:50.312 --> 01:19:52.140
Girl, what are you doing?

01:19:53.663 --> 01:19:55.883
You get all the way out,
and then you come back

01:19:55.883 --> 01:19:59.190
with this big old neon sign
around your neck.

01:19:59.190 --> 01:20:02.498
Shooting the place up,
guns blazing, why?

01:20:03.847 --> 01:20:05.588
May as well have slit
your own throat.

01:20:05.588 --> 01:20:06.937
I know.

01:20:06.937 --> 01:20:09.331
You think we didn't know
about your little rehab?

01:20:09.331 --> 01:20:11.202
We gave you the pass.

01:20:11.202 --> 01:20:12.595
I know.

01:20:13.378 --> 01:20:14.815
You don't think
that I know?

01:20:14.815 --> 01:20:16.033
I fucking know.

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:19.863
I need you to tell him
something for me, Wood.

01:20:21.343 --> 01:20:22.648
Tell him he can have me.

01:20:23.606 --> 01:20:25.608
I'll bring the money,
I'll bring everything.

01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:29.220
He can do whatever the fuck
he wants with me,

01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:31.353
have a field day
with my dead body.

01:20:32.745 --> 01:20:34.922
Just let the girl go.

01:20:36.662 --> 01:20:38.012
That's the deal.

01:20:38.012 --> 01:20:39.622
Me for her.

01:20:40.231 --> 01:20:41.624
You tell him.

01:20:42.581 --> 01:20:44.322
What do you want me
to say, Casey?

01:20:45.497 --> 01:20:47.499
We both know
how this is gonna end.

01:20:48.718 --> 01:20:50.894
I gotta have this one, Wood.

01:20:50.894 --> 01:20:53.462
He doesn't want the girl.
He wants me.

01:20:53.941 --> 01:20:55.681
You tell him that.

01:20:57.596 --> 01:20:58.815
All right.

01:20:59.424 --> 01:21:00.730
I'll tell him.

01:21:17.355 --> 01:21:18.617
Let's do this.

01:21:18.617 --> 01:21:20.184
Time to get swallowed.

01:21:26.190 --> 01:21:27.539
Stop right there.

01:21:27.539 --> 01:21:29.498
Put the bags down.

01:21:32.544 --> 01:21:34.895
Now show me your hands
and back the fuck up.

01:22:30.907 --> 01:22:32.909
All right,
I'll take my bag back.

01:22:32.909 --> 01:22:34.345
- Oh, yeah?
- You haven't paid

01:22:34.345 --> 01:22:35.868
for it yet, Slick.

01:22:35.868 --> 01:22:37.696
How about I pay
for it right now?

01:22:58.152 --> 01:23:01.024
No. No. No!

01:23:01.024 --> 01:23:02.330
Fuck no!

01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:04.680
No! Get the fuck out.

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:07.422
Hey! Easy. Easy. Easy.
Come on!

01:23:07.422 --> 01:23:08.771
What are you doing, huh?

01:23:08.771 --> 01:23:10.512
This is my fucking house.
What do you want?

01:23:10.512 --> 01:23:11.817
Fuck you!

01:23:11.817 --> 01:23:14.124
I'm so fucking over it!

01:23:14.733 --> 01:23:16.648
What? You want the money?
Is that what you want?

01:23:16.648 --> 01:23:18.824
You got the fucking money.
Actually, actually, take it.

01:23:18.824 --> 01:23:20.522
- Bob.
- It's not my fucking money.

01:23:20.522 --> 01:23:22.132
Shut the fuck up.

01:23:24.221 --> 01:23:26.354
- Bob!
- What?!

01:23:32.273 --> 01:23:35.841
Fucking take it!

01:23:35.841 --> 01:23:37.887
You're crossing over.

01:24:13.488 --> 01:24:14.924
So, what are we doing?

01:24:16.230 --> 01:24:19.537
We get Headcase, and...
you get the girl, correct?

01:24:19.537 --> 01:24:21.974
That's the arrangement?
- No.

01:24:21.974 --> 01:24:24.194
No. No. No.
Get the fuck away from her.

01:24:24.194 --> 01:24:25.630
You stick that gun up my face,

01:24:25.630 --> 01:24:27.589
I'll stick it up
your fucking ass, bitch!

01:24:27.589 --> 01:24:29.504
I'm gonna cut you like
a bitch, motherfucker!

01:24:29.504 --> 01:24:31.114
- It's all right.
- What... what do you mean

01:24:31.114 --> 01:24:32.681
it's all right?
It's not fucking all right.

01:24:32.681 --> 01:24:34.335
- I made a deal, okay?
- You what?

01:24:34.335 --> 01:24:36.641
- I'll eat your fucking face!
- I made a fucking deal, okay?

01:24:36.641 --> 01:24:38.687
You're dying tonight, bitch!
You're fucking dying!

01:25:23.732 --> 01:25:25.473
I'm confused.

01:25:25.473 --> 01:25:27.953
This is what she proposed, correct?

01:25:29.781 --> 01:25:31.435
But, now it's no good?

01:25:31.435 --> 01:25:32.871
No good.

01:25:34.090 --> 01:25:36.136
I'm not trading her. I'm not
trading her for anything.

01:25:36.136 --> 01:25:37.615
Oh, come on, Bob.
Don't be stupid!

01:25:37.615 --> 01:25:39.008
Shut up.
Shut the fuck up!

01:25:42.490 --> 01:25:45.406
So, what is it exactly
that you're offering, Bob?

01:25:52.456 --> 01:25:53.936
Where's the rest of it?

01:25:53.936 --> 01:25:55.590
Where's my fucking daughter?

01:25:56.286 --> 01:25:58.375
You'll get the rest
when we've got Gabi

01:25:58.375 --> 01:25:59.898
and we're safe and sound.

01:25:59.898 --> 01:26:01.770
Pay me later?

01:26:03.467 --> 01:26:05.774
I don't think so, Bob.

01:26:05.774 --> 01:26:08.646
It's not like I'm giving you
half your daughter back.

01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:13.173
Your legacy's waiting
for you over that hill.

01:26:14.130 --> 01:26:18.090
When you see her, just drop
the money and take her.

01:26:18.090 --> 01:26:19.788
But all of it, Bob.

01:26:19.788 --> 01:26:22.182
Every penny.

01:26:22.182 --> 01:26:24.401
And you and I are finished.

01:26:25.968 --> 01:26:27.361
Okay.

01:26:29.493 --> 01:26:30.886
Let's go.

01:26:31.930 --> 01:26:33.802
Now you, Headcase.

01:26:34.890 --> 01:26:36.718
I want a word with you.

01:26:54.126 --> 01:26:59.175
I just want you to know that
whatever happens tonight,

01:26:59.175 --> 01:27:01.308
you're crossing over.

01:27:03.005 --> 01:27:05.486
Oh, yeah.
The word's out, honey.

01:27:05.486 --> 01:27:08.184
We're coming
out of the gutter for you.

01:27:08.184 --> 01:27:10.795
And when we find you,

01:27:10.795 --> 01:27:14.234
just know that I'm going to be
right there to watch you beg.

01:27:33.775 --> 01:27:36.560
Unbelievable.
What?

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:38.301
You should have taken
the fucking deal.

01:27:38.301 --> 01:27:39.911
You go behind my back.
It's great.

01:27:39.911 --> 01:27:41.652
I had it all worked out,
you fucking idiot!

01:27:41.652 --> 01:27:43.959
It was done,
you had your daughter back!

01:27:43.959 --> 01:27:45.830
We don't trade people for--

01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:47.223
They're gonna come for us,

01:27:47.223 --> 01:27:48.659
you know that, right?
They're not letting us go.

01:27:48.659 --> 01:27:50.313
They're gonna ride us out
into the fucking black hole,

01:27:50.313 --> 01:27:52.184
and then they'll come.
- I know! I know!

01:27:52.184 --> 01:27:53.664
If you know,
then what's your fucking plan?!

01:27:53.664 --> 01:27:54.970
I don't have a plan,
all right?!

01:27:54.970 --> 01:27:56.841
- So fucking stupid!
- Let's just go get Gabi

01:27:56.841 --> 01:27:58.147
and we'll figure it out.

01:28:35.053 --> 01:28:36.664
Throw the fucking money over.

01:29:09.827 --> 01:29:11.438
Gabi?

01:29:20.142 --> 01:29:22.710
How you getting home, huh?

01:29:22.710 --> 01:29:25.756
How you getting out?

01:29:33.808 --> 01:29:35.070
Thank God.

01:30:15.153 --> 01:30:16.328
Bob.

01:30:20.768 --> 01:30:22.813
Bob, we gotta go.

01:30:22.813 --> 01:30:24.815
They're coming for us, okay?

01:30:24.815 --> 01:30:26.251
Bob!

01:30:27.775 --> 01:30:29.472
We have to get out of here.

01:30:39.439 --> 01:30:40.614
Bob.

01:30:40.614 --> 01:30:42.006
Bob!

01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:44.444
Where the fuck are you going?

01:30:52.016 --> 01:30:53.191
Fuck.

01:31:07.292 --> 01:31:09.686
This way. Here.

01:31:09.686 --> 01:31:11.427
Go to the end. Okay?

01:31:15.083 --> 01:31:16.388
Okay!

01:31:20.523 --> 01:31:21.481
All right.

01:31:21.481 --> 01:31:23.178
Some people are coming.

01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:25.267
Some very bad people.

01:31:25.267 --> 01:31:27.356
And if they see you,

01:31:27.356 --> 01:31:30.098
you point this at them
and you pull the trigger.

01:31:30.098 --> 01:31:32.840
If you run out of bullets,
you just drop your gun,

01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:34.537
pick up the next one.

01:31:34.537 --> 01:31:38.236
And whatever you do, you don't
come out until I come get you.

01:31:39.803 --> 01:31:41.631
Gabi, I'm gonna go now.

01:31:45.679 --> 01:31:47.463
Dad?

01:31:49.421 --> 01:31:50.597
Kill them.

01:31:53.295 --> 01:31:54.949
Kill all of them.

01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:04.600
What the fuck are you doing?!

01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:07.647
Bring the fucking cars up.
Everybody down the hill!

01:35:52.926 --> 01:35:54.188
Case!

01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:07.679
Hey, darling.

01:36:07.679 --> 01:36:09.725
You don't look so hot.

01:36:09.725 --> 01:36:11.379
- Fuck you.

01:36:11.379 --> 01:36:13.120
Yeah, we'll get to that.

01:36:45.761 --> 01:36:47.589
You're all out of bullets, sweetheart.

01:38:02.185 --> 01:38:03.447
Dad.

01:39:46.986 --> 01:39:48.813
You're angry, aren't you?

01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:51.729
It's never gonna be the same

01:39:51.729 --> 01:39:53.296
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

01:39:57.126 --> 01:39:58.562
But be careful.

01:39:58.562 --> 01:40:00.825
Cyrus wants you
to become a war junkie.

01:40:00.825 --> 01:40:02.566
So don't get too much at home.

01:40:02.566 --> 01:40:04.351
You got Gabi to think about.

01:40:07.832 --> 01:40:09.399
Where are you in all of this?

01:40:09.399 --> 01:40:10.792
I'm leaving.

01:40:12.359 --> 01:40:14.013
That's what I wanted
to tell you.

01:40:15.101 --> 01:40:16.711
I'm going, tonight.

01:40:18.321 --> 01:40:20.019
Going where?

01:40:22.978 --> 01:40:24.501
Just going.

01:40:28.331 --> 01:40:30.420
I don't want you to.

01:40:32.074 --> 01:40:33.423
I know.

01:40:41.083 --> 01:40:42.432
I...

01:40:43.607 --> 01:40:45.087
I did some digging.

01:40:45.087 --> 01:40:47.698
I know you didn't ask,
but I figured...

01:40:47.698 --> 01:40:49.178
I figured what the hell.

01:40:49.178 --> 01:40:50.397
You never know.

01:40:51.572 --> 01:40:53.008
You never do.

01:40:59.362 --> 01:41:02.061
She did look for you,
by the way.

01:41:03.497 --> 01:41:05.064
She looked hard.

01:41:06.152 --> 01:41:09.285
You know, private investigators,
APBs, flyers,

01:41:09.285 --> 01:41:10.808
community service.

01:41:10.808 --> 01:41:13.072
Local cop said
she drove him crazy.

01:41:15.117 --> 01:41:17.859
After five years,
and it went cold,

01:41:17.859 --> 01:41:19.295
she moved away.

01:41:25.997 --> 01:41:27.042
Yeah.

01:41:30.872 --> 01:41:32.961
Thank you.

01:41:34.136 --> 01:41:35.485
I mean that.

01:42:07.561 --> 01:42:09.998
Even though I don't believe
in any of your shit...

01:42:11.347 --> 01:42:14.176
...I'd play Mary Magdalene
just to get you off.

01:42:14.176 --> 01:42:15.873
And I would.

01:42:18.224 --> 01:42:20.400
Might even take a little blood.

01:42:26.754 --> 01:42:28.930
But I'd give you as good, man.

01:42:30.149 --> 01:42:31.759
I really would.

01:42:40.333 --> 01:42:42.465
Now do me a favor, Coyote.

01:42:44.859 --> 01:42:46.600
And let me go.

01:42:58.699 --> 01:43:00.483
Take care, okay?

01:46:18.638 --> 01:46:19.943
Relax.

01:46:21.075 --> 01:46:22.772
Finish up.

01:46:32.913 --> 01:46:34.697
Put your hands up.

01:46:39.746 --> 01:46:41.138
Walk out the door.

01:46:57.459 --> 01:46:58.895
Forget about it.

01:47:11.473 --> 01:47:12.692
Sit down.

01:47:31.058 --> 01:47:33.495
What's with all
the fucking drama, girl?

01:47:34.191 --> 01:47:36.803
Why not just do me
while I'm pissing?

01:47:37.978 --> 01:47:40.546
We're in the heart
of true country, so come on.

01:47:40.546 --> 01:47:42.286
Send me home.

01:47:43.462 --> 01:47:44.898
Oh, I get it.

01:47:45.464 --> 01:47:48.075
You want to see if the cock's
feet are made of clay.

01:47:48.075 --> 01:47:49.468
Right, field hand?

01:47:49.468 --> 01:47:51.470
That prince must fall shit?

01:47:52.427 --> 01:47:54.298
Not happening, coolie.

01:47:54.298 --> 01:47:57.301
I'm not like those sheep
whose whore you are.

01:47:57.301 --> 01:47:58.955
I don't pretend to be.

01:47:58.955 --> 01:48:00.696
I am my freedom.

01:48:00.696 --> 01:48:03.743
I wear it!
You are nothing!

01:48:03.743 --> 01:48:07.964
You're just trying to buy
yourself back with one bullet!

01:48:10.663 --> 01:48:12.229
You're crossing over.

01:48:13.883 --> 01:48:15.755
And a part of me
is going with you.

01:51:42.352 --> 01:51:43.658
Where is it?

01:51:50.578 --> 01:51:51.840
Yes!

01:51:54.147 --> 01:51:55.757
Hello?

01:51:58.151 --> 01:51:59.892
<i> Hey, Coyote.</i>

01:52:08.814 --> 01:52:10.598
Case, where the fuck are you?

01:52:14.254 --> 01:52:15.734
<i>I'm here.</i>
