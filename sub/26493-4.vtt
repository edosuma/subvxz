02:50.300 --> 02:51.495
BILLY: SPENCER, YES.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.434
HE OBVIOUSLY IS
A VERY SPECIAL PLAYER,

02:53.440 --> 02:57.331
BUT I TELL YOU ONE THING, HE IS

03:13.360 --> 03:16.011
ALL IM SAYING IS GOING
STRICTLY OFF FANTASY POINTS,

03:16.020 --> 03:17.920
TOUCHDOWNS ARE WORTH MORE
THAN INTERCEPTIONS.

03:17.930 --> 03:19.750
SPENCER: MAN, COME ON! A
PICK CAN CHANGE THE GAME.

03:19.760 --> 03:21.353
AND A TOUCHDOWN
CAN WIN A GAME.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.521
JORDAN: SO YOU THINK
YOUR 5 TOUCHDOWNS

03:22.530 --> 03:23.827
IN THE LAST 3 GAMES
ARE MORE IMPORTANT

03:23.830 --> 03:25.264
THAN SPENCERS
5 PICKS?

03:26.870 --> 03:27.996
WERE ALL RIDING
THE SAME WAVE.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.729

YOU ALWAYS SEEM TO BE
FORGETTING YOUR WALLET,

26:59.350 --> 27:01.671
AND YOU LET EVERYBODY

YOUR RIDICULOUS THEORIES.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.029
OPEN YOUR EYES, OK?

28:59.030 --> 29:00.520
DAD MOVED SPENCER
INTO OUR HOME,

29:00.530 --> 29:02.089
TREATS HIM LIKE A SON.

29:02.100 --> 29:03.864
HOW ELSE IS HE SUPPOSED
TO TREAT HIM, JORDAN?

29:03.870 --> 29:05.463
HE ALSO TOOK ME DOWN
TO A BARBER SHOP

29:05.470 --> 29:07.802
IN HIS OLD
NEIGHBORHOOD, OK?

29:07.810 --> 29:09.107

29:13.150 --> 29:15.073
AND HE ALSO DEPOSITED MONEY

29:15.080 --> 29:16.946
INTO A CRENSHAW
BANK ACCOUNT.

29:16.950 --> 29:18.509
WHOSE BANK ACCOUNT?

29:18.520 --> 29:20.079
I CALLED THE BANK TO
TRY TO FIND OUT,

29:20.090 --> 29:21.785
BUT I NEEDED DADS PIN.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.894

4 TYPES OF CEREAL,

29:46.110 --> 29:47.373

29:47.380 --> 29:48.973
THE OXTAILS FOR YOU.

29:48.980 --> 29:51.074
I DONT NEED
NO OXTAIL.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.981
SO WHAT, I CANT BUY
YOU GROCERIES NOW?

29:53.990 --> 29:55.310
YOU DIDNT BUY ME
ANY GROCERIES.

29:55.320 --> 29:57.311
BILLY BAKER DID,
AND THAT IS NOT OK.

29:57.320 --> 29:59.152
LOOK, HE WANTED ME TO HAVE
AN ALLOWANCE, ALL RIGHT?

29:59.160 --> 30:01.083
WHATEVER YOU SPENT ON
THESE GROCERIES,

30:01.090 --> 30:02.353
IMA PAY HIM BACK.

30:02.360 --> 30:03.998
AND WHATEVER ALLOWANCE
YOU HAVE LEFT,

30:04.000 --> 30:05.991
YOURE GONNA GIVE IT
BACK TO HIM TONIGHT.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.968
ITS ALL GONE.

30:12.870 --> 30:14.406
HOW MUCH?

30:17.310 --> 30:19.904
THIS AINT YOU, SPENCER.

30:19.910 --> 30:21.309
WHAT AM 1 SUPPOSED TO DO?

30:21.310 --> 30:23.642
YOU WANTED ME TO MOVE
TO BEVERLY HILLS, AND I DID.

30:23.650 --> 30:25.641
AND ON THE FIELD, THINGS
ARE STARTING TO CLICK,

30:25.650 --> 30:28.085
BUT OFF THE FIELD, I STILL
FEEL LIKE IM TRYING TO FIT IN.

30:28.090 --> 30:30.081
I KNOW ITS HARD,

30:30.090 --> 30:33.082
BUT THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
YOUR GREATEST STRENGTH.

30:33.090 --> 30:35.923
YOU WORK HARDER THAN
ANYBODY ELSE.

30:35.930 --> 30:38.991
YOU DONT NEED ANYTHING
GIVEN TO YOU.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.263
YOU EARN IT.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.429
JUST DONT YOU...

30:44.440 --> 30:47.159
PRETEND TO BE
SOMETHING YOURE NOT

30:47.170 --> 30:50.105
JUST TO TRY
TO FIT IN.

30:50.110 --> 30:54.047
AND, REMEMBER,
THE FREE STUFF,

30:54.050 --> 30:57.839
IT ALWAYS COMES
WITH A BIGGER COST.

31:01.990 --> 31:04.118
[VEHICLE HORNS HONKING,
SIRENS IN DISTANCE]

31:08.200 --> 31:10.157
YOU SAVED MY ASS,
SPENCER.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.992
WHOSE CAR DID WE
JUST FIX, MAN?

31:14.400 --> 31:16.664
IT BELONGS TO THE FAMILY
THAT OWNS THE HOUSE.

31:16.670 --> 31:19.037
THEYRE ALWAYS OUT
OF THE COUNTRY.

31:19.040 --> 31:20.166
WE RENT THE GUESTHOUSE

31:20.170 --> 31:21.399
SO I CAN PLAY BALL
AT BEVERLY.

31:21.410 --> 31:23.003
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS,

31:23.010 --> 31:25.104
PRETENDING YOU GOT
ALL THIS MONEY?

31:25.110 --> 31:26.180
A YEAR AGO, I WASNT
PRETENDING.

31:26.180 --> 31:27.944
WE WERE LOADED.

31:29.420 --> 31:32.139
WE LOST EVERYTHING
OVERNIGHT.

31:32.150 --> 31:35.256
WAS I SUPPOSED
TO CHANGE WHO I AM?

31:35.260 --> 31:37.581
I DONT KNOW HOW
TO BE THE POOR KID.

31:37.590 --> 31:41.083
BIG J: SPENCER, WE GOT
A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

31:44.600 --> 31:45.999
WHERES THE PORSCHE?

31:46.000 --> 31:48.230

31:48.240 --> 31:50.163
SOMEONE MUSTVE
BOOSTED IT.

31:50.170 --> 31:51.399

31:51.400 --> 31:54.006
I FEEL BAD

31:54.010 --> 31:55.330
COOP: STOLEN?

31:55.340 --> 31:57.001

AND ITS ALL MY FAULT.

32:00.380 --> 32:02.610
IF I HADNT HAVE TAKEN
IT TO BIG JS.

32:02.620 --> 32:04.213
COOP: IT MIGHT NOT
BE GONE YET.

32:04.220 --> 32:05.244
BUT, LISTEN...

32:07.120 --> 32:09.612
I COULD MAKE A CALL,
BUT YOU NOT GONNA LIKE IT.

32:09.620 --> 32:12.226
IF THE CARS STILL IN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

32:12.230 --> 32:13.720
SHAWN PROBABLY HEARD
ABOUT IT.

32:13.730 --> 32:16.995
NAH. LOOK, I DONT
WANT THIS ON HIM.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.490
COME ON, MAN. SHAWN IS NOT
WHO YOU THINK HE IS.

32:18.500 --> 32:20.628
HE GOT ME THIS JOB.

32:20.630 --> 32:23.133
AND IF I ASK HIM FOR HELP,
HES GONNA DO THIS FOR ME.

32:23.140 --> 32:25.234
WHYD HE DO THIS
FOR YOU?

32:25.240 --> 32:28.130
CAUSE SHAWN GOT MY BACK.

32:28.140 --> 32:29.437
SO ITS ON YOU.

32:45.660 --> 32:47.480
WHATS UP, SPENCE?

32:48.800 --> 32:50.222
ME AND HIM GO WAY BACK.

32:50.230 --> 32:52.119
WE USED TO GET INTO SOME
TROUBLE BACK IN THE DAY.

32:52.130 --> 32:54.724
I REMEMBER WE PLAYED
DARTS IN MY UNCLES GARAGE,

32:54.730 --> 32:56.334
TORE THAT BOARD UP.

32:56.340 --> 32:58.308
AND HE PICKED UP
A FOOTBALL ONE DAY

32:58.310 --> 33:00.267
AND NEVER LOOKED BACK.

33:00.270 --> 33:02.409
SUDDENLY, I WAS
A BAD INFLUENCE.

33:02.410 --> 33:04.333
SO WHEN COOP CALLED,
I THOUGHT, "NAH.

33:04.340 --> 33:06.308
"SHE MUST
BE PLAYING.

33:06.310 --> 33:07.675
SPENCER JAMES DONT
NEED ANYBODYS HELP."

33:07.680 --> 33:09.273
BUT HERE YOU ARE.

33:09.280 --> 33:11.169

33:11.180 --> 33:13.285
I KNOW THIS IS HARD

33:14.690 --> 33:19.127
BECAUSE WE

33:19.130 --> 33:22.293

33:22.300 --> 33:26.328
ASHER: SPENCER, YOU
DONT NEED TO DO THIS.

33:29.300 --> 33:31.462
I NEED YOU, SHAWN.

33:31.470 --> 33:34.110
DAMN. THAT FELT GOOD.

33:35.310 --> 33:37.233
I MADE SOME CALLS,
BUT IT WASNT MY CREW.

33:37.240 --> 33:38.742
BUT YOU CANT BOOST
A CAR THAT PRETTY

33:38.750 --> 33:40.479
AND NOT BE RUNNING
YOUR MOUTH ABOUT IT.

33:40.480 --> 33:42.619
SO YOU KNOW WHO HAS IT?

33:42.620 --> 33:44.770
