WEBVTT

00:06.048 --> 00:07.967
Last season on Bosch...

00:08.008 --> 00:09.301
He's been a different person

00:09.343 --> 00:10.469
since he solved
his mom's murder.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.054
Her killer got away with it.

00:12.096 --> 00:13.723
Edward Gunn
got away with two, at least.

00:13.764 --> 00:16.058
Harry's a lot
of things, but he is not

00:16.100 --> 00:18.477
-a coldblooded...
-I agree with you, I agree.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.354
But he is lying
about his prints.

00:20.396 --> 00:22.648
You're investigating me for
Gunn's murder

00:22.690 --> 00:24.275
No. I think you're being set up.

00:24.316 --> 00:25.943
-You think?
-I know you're being set up.

00:25.985 --> 00:27.903
When were you planning
to tell me this, partner?

00:27.945 --> 00:30.406
Detective, weren't you
a defendant in a civil suit

00:30.448 --> 00:32.533
where you were accused
of planting evidence?

00:32.575 --> 00:35.244
-Yes. -What was the outcome
of that lawsuit?

00:35.286 --> 00:36.954
Jury found for the plaintiff.

00:36.996 --> 00:39.540
-Nothing further.
-Honey Chandler

00:39.582 --> 00:41.917
has painted an indelible
portrait of you, Detective,

00:41.959 --> 00:45.755
that you can't be trusted,

00:45.796 --> 00:47.757
that you'll do anything
and say anything,

00:47.798 --> 00:50.968
-cut any corner to win. -This
is bullshit. I don't do that.

00:51.010 --> 00:54.054
You have that reputation,
Detective, deserved or not.

00:54.096 --> 00:56.640
You don't know, youngblood.

00:56.682 --> 00:58.392
You don't know.

00:58.434 --> 00:59.894
Never assume.

00:59.935 --> 01:01.896
Why would Bosch do that?

01:01.937 --> 01:04.732
He takes two assholes
off the board with one move.

01:04.774 --> 01:06.525
He's hiding something.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.027
I can smell it.

01:10.696 --> 01:13.115
The Koreatown Killer, aka KTK,

01:13.157 --> 01:14.867
first became active
four years ago.

01:14.909 --> 01:17.703
Four carjackings,
three shootings, two murders.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.456
The latest carjacking victim
helped us develop a new sketch.

01:20.498 --> 01:22.583
So, when do you hear
about the captain's exam?

01:22.625 --> 01:24.418
I heard.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.086
Next to last band.

01:26.128 --> 01:28.714
Shit. Sorry.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.883
The truth is, I think
I wanted to make captain

01:30.925 --> 01:32.927
more than I wanted
to actually be one.

01:32.968 --> 01:35.095
I'm happy where I am.

01:35.137 --> 01:36.972
With you assholes.

01:37.014 --> 01:38.182
You look tired, J.

01:38.224 --> 01:39.558
The Bosch still
wearing you down?

01:39.600 --> 01:42.436
You look great.

01:42.478 --> 01:45.105
I know you got your eyes on RHD.

01:45.147 --> 01:46.482
Yeah.

01:46.524 --> 01:48.484
But... the politics involved...

01:48.526 --> 01:50.402
you know better than anyone.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.947
Still, this looks good
for you, Santiago.

01:52.988 --> 01:54.698
What are you trying
to tell me, Terry?

01:54.740 --> 01:57.284
Don't unravel the sweater.

01:57.326 --> 01:59.078
No intention.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.913
Fuckin' IA. Harry...

02:00.955 --> 02:02.748
- -

02:04.750 --> 02:07.962
Tell me
you're gonna quit, Jerry.

02:08.003 --> 02:09.463
Take your pension,
call it a day.

02:09.505 --> 02:10.548
Now, what else would I do?

02:10.589 --> 02:12.174
Watch your boys grow up.

02:12.216 --> 02:15.553
I will. Don't worry.

02:15.594 --> 02:17.179
Lord, I missed you.

02:17.221 --> 02:18.889
-And you're taller.
-Do not go down that road.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.224
Where are
you and Reggie staying?

02:20.266 --> 02:22.768
Somewhere swanky
with a pool, I hope?

02:22.810 --> 02:24.144
Reggie's in Shanghai.

02:24.186 --> 02:26.772
I actually hoped
I could stay here.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.483
Look, Jay,
I got you what you wanted.

02:29.525 --> 02:32.194
We're greedy bastards,
what can I say?

02:32.236 --> 02:34.196
You can say, "Welcome back
to the Bureau, Agent Wish,"

02:34.238 --> 02:35.865
give me a desk and a badge.

02:35.906 --> 02:38.409
You sent that video
to the Times.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.327
Holland's a monster.

02:40.369 --> 02:41.996
So was Gunn.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.414
The Taferos.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.374
We took them all
off the chart, Jerry.

02:45.416 --> 02:47.626
They'll never hurt
anybody again.

02:49.587 --> 02:53.007
Man, two weeks ago, you
didn't want to be my partner.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.177
Now I'm-I'm not so sure
I can be yours.

02:57.219 --> 02:58.804
What's burning?

02:58.846 --> 03:00.598
River Watch
Retirement Community.

03:00.639 --> 03:02.099
I used to visit a guy there.

03:02.141 --> 03:04.602
Retired detective,
John Caffrey.

03:04.643 --> 03:06.437
Why would Caffrey send
you his high school yearbook?

03:06.478 --> 03:08.272
I should have fucking known.

03:08.314 --> 03:10.941
Arno Epperson, AKA Fox Mitchell.

03:10.983 --> 03:12.359
The man
who murdered your mother.

03:12.401 --> 03:13.861
Or so I thought.

03:13.903 --> 03:16.488
Bradley Walker.
He and Arno were tight.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.490
The Police Commission president?

03:18.532 --> 03:22.119
His father more or less ran the
city council for three decades.

03:22.161 --> 03:23.704
So Walker killed your mother
now?

03:23.746 --> 03:25.915
That's your theory?

03:25.956 --> 03:28.918
Do you have any idea
how you sound?

03:28.959 --> 03:33.672
RHD says Caffrey was the target
of the arson at River Watch.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.591
Somebody wanted to wipe him out

03:35.633 --> 03:37.760
and whatever he had
in that apartment.

03:37.801 --> 03:40.596
You want me to help you conduct
a secret investigation

03:40.638 --> 03:43.432
of the man who's scheduled
to pin the stars on my collar.

03:43.474 --> 03:45.935
Don't you want to know
if that man's a murderer?

04:15.881 --> 04:19.176
Put yourself
in these detectives' shoes.

04:19.218 --> 04:22.179
An eight-year-old girl
is missing.

04:22.221 --> 04:24.682
You think you have the man
who took her.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.183
This man,

04:26.225 --> 04:27.685
the plaintiff,

04:27.726 --> 04:30.437
Michael Harris.

04:30.479 --> 04:34.400
But he won't say where she is.

04:34.441 --> 04:37.403
He won't even admit
that he took her.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.238
So what do you do?

04:39.279 --> 04:41.448
Now, mind you,
you're not just any detective.

04:41.490 --> 04:42.866
You're LAPD.

04:42.908 --> 04:44.702
Robbery-Homicide Division.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.704
Cream of the crop. Legendary.

04:46.745 --> 04:49.123
It was cops like you
who solved Manson,

04:49.164 --> 04:52.793
Night Stalker, Grim Sleeper.

04:52.835 --> 04:56.171
Maybe this little girl's
already dead.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.467
But maybe she's not.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.803
And if you can get Harris
to tell you

05:02.845 --> 05:04.972
where he's got her stashed,

05:05.014 --> 05:08.225
maybe you can save her life.

05:09.727 --> 05:12.146
So what do you do?

05:13.147 --> 05:15.107
You torture him?

05:15.149 --> 05:17.526
You wrap a plastic bag
around his head,

05:17.568 --> 05:19.945
choke off his air,
try to get him to talk?

05:19.987 --> 05:22.698
You gonna stick a sharpened,

05:22.740 --> 05:25.284
number two,
Black Guardian pencil

05:25.325 --> 05:26.744
into his ear,
puncture his eardrum?

05:26.785 --> 05:29.329
Keep on going into his skull,

05:29.371 --> 05:31.248
causing permanent deafness?

05:32.291 --> 05:33.667
No.

05:33.709 --> 05:35.502
No, you don't.

05:35.544 --> 05:39.173
Not in a civil society.

05:40.549 --> 05:42.259
We don't have to settle.

05:42.301 --> 05:45.512
-I can win this. -The win,
for the city of Los Angeles,

05:45.554 --> 05:48.182
is making Black Guardian
go away.

05:48.223 --> 05:50.851
Move to the dark side,
you lose track of time.

05:50.893 --> 05:53.479
-The man doesn't have a case.
-Doesn't have to.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.315
Just the trial. The great man
handing out sound bites

05:56.356 --> 05:58.067
on the courthouse steps
every day--

05:58.108 --> 06:01.236
-that sets us back 30 years.
-

06:01.278 --> 06:02.946
No, no, no.

06:02.988 --> 06:05.449
Mr. Kaplan, I told Howard,
he wants this check,

06:05.491 --> 06:07.785
-I need him...
-He's not settling.

06:07.826 --> 06:09.787
-We had an agreement.
$420,000... -For any price.

06:09.828 --> 06:12.581
He's taking this case to trial.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.961
I will prove

06:18.003 --> 06:20.714
I will pro...

06:20.756 --> 06:23.342
The evidence will show

06:23.383 --> 06:27.763
that these LAPD
Robbery-Homicide detectives,

06:27.805 --> 06:29.973
under the color of law,

06:30.015 --> 06:32.601
men who have sworn an oath
to protect and serve

06:32.643 --> 06:35.354
the citizens of Los Angeles,

06:35.395 --> 06:38.232
tortured an innocent man.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.360
In a civil society,

06:41.401 --> 06:44.363
racism has no part of justice.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.115
In a civil society,

06:46.156 --> 06:48.325
torture has no part of justice.

06:48.367 --> 06:50.160
In a civil society...

06:50.202 --> 06:52.538
Shit, this thing needs to sing.

06:52.579 --> 06:56.500
It will by Monday. But you don't
want to offend our jurors.

06:56.542 --> 06:58.752
Oh, yeah, I do want offended.
I want them deeply offended,

06:58.794 --> 07:01.421
-outraged.
-By the crime, not the lawyer.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.215
Don't use the word "Christ."

07:05.884 --> 07:07.678
How'd they take it?

07:07.719 --> 07:09.388
Missy shit two bricks.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.056
Okay. I'll need a nice,

07:11.098 --> 07:14.601
warm bath to un-see that.

07:18.689 --> 07:20.232
What about Irving?

07:20.274 --> 07:22.025
-Not happy.
-Yeah, I'll bet.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.236
This trial's gonna feed
his whole department

07:24.278 --> 07:25.821
into the wood chipper.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.204
The whole point

07:34.246 --> 07:35.622
of sushi is that it's fresh.

07:35.664 --> 07:37.082
And that's not why I'm calling.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.625
Sugarfish.

07:38.667 --> 07:39.626
It's your favorite.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.461
Not even two hours old.

07:41.503 --> 07:44.464
Mom's taking me
to the tournament tomorrow.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.800
Okay. Still want me to go?

07:46.842 --> 07:48.635
As long as you don't yell.

07:48.677 --> 07:51.054
-Can't make any promises.
-It's fine.

07:51.096 --> 07:54.057
-I'll just pretend you're
somebody else's dad. -Right.

07:54.099 --> 07:56.894
I still can't get ahold
of Reggie.

07:56.935 --> 07:58.562
His Skype's all screwed up.

07:58.604 --> 07:59.646
Or mine is.

08:03.901 --> 08:05.277
Dad?

08:05.319 --> 08:07.321
-Right here.
-Something's going on

08:07.362 --> 08:09.531
-with them. Mom and Reggie.
-Are you asking

08:09.573 --> 08:10.949
or telling me?

08:10.991 --> 08:12.659
You're busy.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.411
I am.
-Good talk, Dad.

08:14.453 --> 08:15.996
Don't stay out too late.

08:16.038 --> 08:17.664
Love you.

08:56.787 --> 08:58.372
Hi.

09:02.793 --> 09:04.753
Ah, here.

09:04.795 --> 09:06.964
-Phil Gentry. Thanks.
-

09:07.005 --> 09:09.716
Excuse me.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.969
Hello?

09:12.010 --> 09:13.220
Uh...

09:13.262 --> 09:14.972
-just...
-Thanks.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.848
Hold on.

09:23.814 --> 09:25.983
Hello?

09:43.709 --> 09:45.377
What was his counter?

09:55.429 --> 09:56.972
He'll call Sunday night, Irv.

09:57.014 --> 09:59.057
He's trying
to make the city sweat.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.768
It's working.
He thinks he can win this.

10:01.810 --> 10:02.853
No.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.104
It's a play.

10:04.146 --> 10:06.064
He thinks he can jack up
the settlement.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.485
Let's meet tomorrow
and decide how best to proceed.

10:10.527 --> 10:11.820
It's not the end of the world.

10:27.753 --> 10:29.129
Harry Bosch.

10:29.171 --> 10:30.964
Just the man I need.

10:31.006 --> 10:32.382
Phil Gentry.

10:32.424 --> 10:34.051
A thousand bucks a ticket,

10:34.092 --> 10:36.053
and they let some joker
say he's me.

10:36.094 --> 10:37.971
I'm sorry to hear that.

10:38.013 --> 10:40.974
I was just thinking
maybe you could find him.

10:41.016 --> 10:42.309
You know...

10:42.351 --> 10:44.478
solve the case.

10:46.188 --> 10:49.649
-It's a joke.
-That's a good one.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.026
Harry Bosch.

10:51.068 --> 10:53.779
I'm glad I ran into you.
Barkeep?

10:53.820 --> 10:56.782
Second chair
usually has a chair.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.367
In court, is what I'm saying.

10:58.408 --> 10:59.993
Ah, well, in my experience,

11:00.035 --> 11:01.703
second chair
is something that you earn.

11:01.745 --> 11:03.705
-I said bold the changes.
-Oh, I did.

11:03.747 --> 11:05.415
Well, bold and underline.

11:05.457 --> 11:07.501
-I got to see them.
-Yes, sir.

11:07.542 --> 11:10.545
Coming right up.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.798
-You know what your problem is,
Kaplan

11:12.839 --> 11:15.884
You want to walk
before you can crawl.

11:15.926 --> 11:18.553
At your age, I was running
a free legal clinic

11:18.595 --> 11:19.888
for grape pickers in Salinas.

11:19.930 --> 11:21.098
You-you want to whine
about chairs.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.349
- -Says the man

11:22.391 --> 11:23.892
who just turned down
mid-six figures

11:23.934 --> 11:25.685
to play Powerball with a jury.

11:25.727 --> 11:28.313
Well, that is not
what is going on here.

11:30.732 --> 11:31.942
Any word

11:31.983 --> 11:33.860
on the tech request I put in

11:33.902 --> 11:35.445
-for court on Friday?
-Not yet.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.072
I could follow up.

11:37.114 --> 11:38.407
You know that there were
a thousand

11:38.448 --> 11:40.575
police killings
in America last year?

11:40.617 --> 11:42.244
Do you have any idea
how many cops

11:42.285 --> 11:43.954
were convicted of murder
or manslaughter?

11:43.995 --> 11:45.539
-Not one.
-None. Zip. Zero.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.290
Cities don't even bother

11:47.332 --> 11:49.459
to keep use-of-force statistics.
What does that tell you?

11:49.501 --> 11:50.752
That tells me
that you're considering

11:50.794 --> 11:52.712
putting that in your opening.

11:52.754 --> 11:53.964
Look, I'd save it.
Just stick with Harris.

11:54.005 --> 11:55.382
No, forget it.

11:55.424 --> 11:56.675
-I'll just go with this.
-Are you sure?

11:56.716 --> 11:58.176
Look, I just have to print it.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.928
Yeah. Just keep your phone on
this weekend,

11:59.970 --> 12:01.721
there, Kaplan. Just in case.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.892
In case of what?

14:26.616 --> 14:29.286
- -

14:29.327 --> 14:30.537
- -

14:34.749 --> 14:36.001
- -

15:07.449 --> 15:09.451
That sprinkler needs help.

15:11.286 --> 15:14.539
Patrol car ran over it.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.583
You okay?

15:17.792 --> 15:20.086
Yeah.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.130
I'll be right in.

15:33.558 --> 15:36.227
Please answer this time.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.092
Open for 500.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.678
I can count, honey.

16:09.719 --> 16:10.970
Raise.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.692
The raise is 2,200.

16:25.694 --> 16:28.363
Sorry.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.407
Call.

16:33.201 --> 16:34.577
Two players.

16:41.209 --> 16:42.419
No checks accepted.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.586
I got a big hand here.

16:43.628 --> 16:46.005
I'm all in.

17:08.153 --> 17:10.739
5,950.

17:10.780 --> 17:14.534
Call.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.162
Oh, goddamn it.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.621
Nice flop.

17:18.663 --> 17:20.039
Bitch fucked me again.

17:20.081 --> 17:21.207
You fucked yourself.

17:21.249 --> 17:22.375
You overplayed a weak ace.

17:22.417 --> 17:24.419
What did you just say?

17:24.461 --> 17:25.920
You heard me.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.130
Now back off.

17:29.841 --> 17:31.718
Cards?

17:31.760 --> 17:33.261
Yes.

17:33.303 --> 17:34.888
Come on. Come on.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.264
Come on. Come on, give me one.

17:36.306 --> 17:38.516
Give me one. Give me one.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.685
Son of a bitch.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.355
Nice playing with you.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.815
Borrow a hundred grand,

17:45.857 --> 17:47.108
don't pay,

17:47.150 --> 17:48.860
bank swoops your fucking house.

17:48.902 --> 17:52.822
Borrow 50 mil and don't pay,

17:52.864 --> 17:55.617
my bank buys a table
at your foundation's fundraiser,

17:55.658 --> 17:57.660
and yours truly
has to fucking go.

17:57.702 --> 17:59.871
Too big to fail.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.708
Thousand bucks a ticket
to help the homeless?

18:03.750 --> 18:05.585
No irony there.

18:05.627 --> 18:08.713
Brad Walker doesn't give a shit
about low-cost housing.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.215
It's all politics, Harry.

18:10.256 --> 18:13.426
Leveraging the city
for a variance

18:13.468 --> 18:14.928
to build his luxury condo tower.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.515
Councilman Steven Clark.

18:18.556 --> 18:20.475
Purveyor of said variance.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.980
So, how's Becca doing
with the college thing?

18:26.022 --> 18:27.524
Ah, she wants Columbia.

18:27.565 --> 18:29.567
She doesn't have a shot. Maddie?

18:29.609 --> 18:31.361
Still waiting on Chapman.

18:33.279 --> 18:36.115
Mariachis. Fuck.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.329
I'm out of here.

18:41.371 --> 18:44.916
Thanks for the drink, Phil.

19:08.022 --> 19:09.774
Detective Harry Bosch.

19:11.568 --> 19:14.779
I had no idea you were a
supporter of affordable housing.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.614
Anything helps the little guy.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.409
I like hearing that.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.327
I was actually hoping
to talk to Councilman Clark.

19:21.369 --> 19:23.538
Stevie?

19:23.580 --> 19:25.123
What about?

19:26.624 --> 19:28.251
Cold case I'm chasing.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.671
Justice never sleeps.

19:34.215 --> 19:36.426
I'll introduce you. We've known
each other since high school.

19:38.469 --> 19:40.221
I've got to take this.

19:40.263 --> 19:42.932
Reception's lousy in here.

19:42.974 --> 19:45.101
Bosch.

19:51.399 --> 19:52.984
Bosch, where are you?

19:53.026 --> 19:54.569
-Downtown.
-

19:54.611 --> 19:57.697
We've got a 187
at Angel's Flight.

19:57.739 --> 19:58.948
How quickly can you get here?

19:58.990 --> 20:00.325
I'm on my way.

20:02.577 --> 20:04.871
Thank you.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.458
Eleanor.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.460
I know it's late notice, and the
buy-in's kinda steep, but...

20:10.501 --> 20:13.963
-Home game?
-50 grand, cash. Tomorrow night.

20:14.005 --> 20:16.341
It's the Chinese guys.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.134
The wild Chinese guys.

20:18.176 --> 20:19.802
The high roller
sports book guys?

20:19.844 --> 20:21.471
They asked me to put
a game together.

20:23.431 --> 20:25.433
Wild losers.

20:25.475 --> 20:28.311
Who wants to play with them?

20:39.364 --> 20:40.657
Look at this.

20:40.698 --> 20:42.450
Got enough RHD guys out here

20:42.492 --> 20:44.494
to solve an actual case.

20:44.535 --> 20:46.079
Is that you, Drake?

20:46.120 --> 20:48.081
Bosch.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.248
Field trip from the
old folks' home?

20:49.290 --> 20:51.918
Howard Elias is in there.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.796
Deader than a motherfucker.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.216
Why are you guys hanging back?

20:58.257 --> 21:01.177
-Conflict of interest.
-Chief pulled us off.

21:01.219 --> 21:03.972
He's gonna start
a Special Task Force.

21:04.013 --> 21:05.723
It's lose-lose for you, Harry.

21:05.765 --> 21:09.018
Either piss off the department
or the whole fucking city.

21:10.979 --> 21:12.689
-Yeah.
-You catch who did it,

21:12.730 --> 21:14.440
bring him down to our crib.

21:14.482 --> 21:16.234
We'll give him a goddamn medal.

21:16.275 --> 21:20.071
Two times at 4640 Paradise.

21:20.113 --> 21:22.073
Code four.

21:34.335 --> 21:38.840
Only thing we can be sure of
in life... is death.

21:38.881 --> 21:41.175
RHD's not shedding any tears.

21:41.217 --> 21:43.302
The man ruined a lot of careers.

21:43.344 --> 21:46.389
I've talked to
Lieutenant Billets,

21:46.431 --> 21:47.390
cut you free of the
Hollywood rotation

21:47.432 --> 21:50.101
-until we get this handled.
-We?

21:50.143 --> 21:52.729
You, Robertson and Pierce.

21:52.770 --> 21:55.773
Plus Snyder and Lincoln
from Internal Affairs.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.316
Who's running the show?

21:57.358 --> 21:59.485
You.

21:59.527 --> 22:01.320
We all know

22:01.362 --> 22:02.947
-what a team player you are.
-Yeah, the thing is, Chief,

22:02.989 --> 22:04.699
Sergeant Snyder and I,
we have a history.

22:04.741 --> 22:06.409
You have a history
with the world, Detective.

22:06.451 --> 22:10.413
But not with Howard Elias.

22:10.455 --> 22:13.207
Now, it is essential
we clear this case quickly.

22:13.249 --> 22:15.001
You and Robertson
are our two best

22:15.043 --> 22:16.961
homicide detectives not in RHD.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.005
And Snyder and Lincoln did the
Black Guardian investigation.

22:19.047 --> 22:22.675
Their knowledge of that case,
and others, should be useful.

22:22.717 --> 22:24.385
Three-piece suit.

22:24.427 --> 22:26.888
You know me better than that.

22:26.929 --> 22:29.265
Optics are part of your job.

22:29.307 --> 22:31.517
Right now, the only color
I'm concerned with is blue.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.395
Tram operator?

22:34.437 --> 22:36.981
ID says Lanny Johnson.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.441
Neck wound, through and through.

22:38.483 --> 22:41.235
-Killed first.
-After Elias boarded.

22:41.277 --> 22:44.322
-Assuming Elias is the primary.
-The public will.

22:44.363 --> 22:47.992
He turned down a settlement
on Black Guardian today.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.786
Trial was gonna start
Monday morning.

22:51.496 --> 22:53.206
If this goes where
the public thinks it goes?

22:53.247 --> 22:55.124
That's my concern.

22:55.166 --> 22:56.793
You just follow the evidence.

22:56.834 --> 23:00.213
Let the chips fall
where they may.

23:07.220 --> 23:08.888
Detective Bosch.

23:08.930 --> 23:12.058
Sergeant, take your partner,
shadow the crims.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.227
See if you can find that
through-and-through slug

23:14.268 --> 23:16.437
that killed Mr. Johnson.

23:18.815 --> 23:20.775
Nice to meet you, too.

23:43.714 --> 23:45.424
Not much foot traffic up here
that late.

23:45.466 --> 23:48.803
A jogger saw the broken
control booth window.

23:48.845 --> 23:51.264
Operator's body inside.

23:51.305 --> 23:54.308
-When did the call come in?
-2346.

23:54.350 --> 23:56.853
Tram shuts down at 2200.

23:56.894 --> 23:59.438
Didn't take long to ID the man.

23:59.480 --> 24:03.025
There's a dartboard with his
face on it in our war room.

24:03.067 --> 24:05.278
So the bodies pretty much
the way you found them?

24:05.319 --> 24:09.323
We'd barely got started
when Chief gave us the hook.

24:09.365 --> 24:11.325
Surveillance cameras?

24:11.367 --> 24:13.244
Two on the wheelhouse
are easily avoided.

24:13.286 --> 24:14.620
Good coverage
in the water court,

24:14.662 --> 24:17.039
spotty on the access points.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.085
His office is in
the Bradbury building.

24:21.127 --> 24:24.255
He lives in Baldwin Hills.

24:24.297 --> 24:27.133
Why would Howard Elias
be on Angel's Flight?

24:27.175 --> 24:29.677
My guys think it was a robbery.

24:29.719 --> 24:32.805
Yeah. That'd be convenient
for everyone, wouldn't it?

24:32.847 --> 24:34.182
Watch and wallet missing.

24:34.223 --> 24:37.476
Rooker did a pass through
the tram.

24:40.313 --> 24:41.981
Your people gonna give me
trouble, Captain?

24:43.733 --> 24:46.444
It wasn't one of my guys, Bosch.

24:46.485 --> 24:50.489
You'd be wasting your time
you look there too long.

24:59.165 --> 25:02.460
Man's gotta sit to think.

25:05.296 --> 25:08.216
Sir.

25:08.257 --> 25:10.885
Came all the way from Montrose
to make sure he's dead?

25:10.927 --> 25:13.346
Well, that son of a bitch
wrote me up twice.

25:13.387 --> 25:14.764
Ain't nothing personal, Terry.

25:14.805 --> 25:16.349
Mr. Sues and Settles.

25:16.390 --> 25:18.100
Yeah, well, I'll cry
on the way home.

25:18.142 --> 25:19.560
Who's that?

25:21.604 --> 25:23.648
Second best partner I ever had.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.657
Where the hell have you been?

25:32.698 --> 25:35.201
Home, mostly.

25:35.243 --> 25:36.702
It's a hell of a thing, huh?

25:36.744 --> 25:38.788
Oh, for fuck's sake, Frankie.

25:38.829 --> 25:41.290
Here. Take these.

25:41.332 --> 25:43.334
Chew 'em.

25:52.802 --> 25:55.137
Hey, big dog.
Cool to come in?

25:55.179 --> 25:56.847
Just wrapping up, Harry.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.016
-This one yours now?
-Yeah.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.726
What a special treat.

26:03.020 --> 26:06.649
Hey, Pierce, get in here.

26:08.317 --> 26:10.820
Glove up, check that briefcase.

26:10.861 --> 26:13.531
Don't we need a warrant?

26:13.572 --> 26:16.409
We don't know whose it is.

26:16.450 --> 26:18.953
Okay, Potts.
Give me some good news.

26:18.995 --> 26:20.788
It's pretty clean.

26:20.830 --> 26:22.873
Bullet in the chest went through
and impacted

26:22.915 --> 26:24.792
on that metal frame up there.

26:24.834 --> 26:26.794
Looks like a nine,
but it's no good for ballistics.

26:26.836 --> 26:28.421
Nine's a pretty common cop gun.

26:28.462 --> 26:29.588
Casings?

26:29.630 --> 26:30.881
No sign of them.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.425
Yeah, a cop would have
picked them up.

26:32.466 --> 26:34.010
Bullet up the ass
should be good

26:34.051 --> 26:35.720
for a match,
if you find the weapon.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.972
Front pocket.

26:38.014 --> 26:40.683
Car keys, money clip. Wallet was
lifted from the back left.

26:40.725 --> 26:43.352
Watch pulled off from
the left wrist, extended.

26:43.394 --> 26:45.396
-Phone?
-No sign of one.

26:45.438 --> 26:47.773
Thanks, amigo.

26:58.701 --> 27:00.328
Is that a defensive wound?

27:02.121 --> 27:05.458
I'm not buying RHD's
robbery theory. You?

27:05.499 --> 27:07.043
Lead enema says no.

27:07.084 --> 27:08.919
No, it's not.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.589
Latch got sprung
when it hit the wall.

27:17.136 --> 27:20.264
Okay, so watch and wallet
get grabbed in a rush,

27:20.306 --> 27:22.099
but missed the money clip.

27:22.141 --> 27:23.476
What are the odds?

27:23.517 --> 27:25.519
Somebody wants it to look
like a robbery.

27:25.561 --> 27:27.521
Yeah. Not for nothing.

27:27.563 --> 27:31.567
What do you make of your
old partner's cameo?

27:31.609 --> 27:34.528
Not as much as you, I guess.

27:34.570 --> 27:37.698
All right, so the tram arrives,

27:37.740 --> 27:39.158
Elias would have seen
his killer waiting.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.618
Unless they rode up together.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.411
No, the tram operator
was killed first,

27:42.453 --> 27:44.246
after he the initiated the ride.

27:44.288 --> 27:46.123
So Elias doesn't hear it
or see it?

27:46.165 --> 27:49.460
Yeah, the ride's loud.

27:49.502 --> 27:53.255
No. Shooter was waiting,
like you said.

27:53.297 --> 27:56.175
Elias rises up,
steps forward to disembark.

27:56.217 --> 27:57.968
He's not aware of a threat.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.929
He sees the gun,
his hand comes up.

27:59.970 --> 28:01.722
Right. Well, the shot goes
through him as he turns,

28:01.764 --> 28:03.808
momentum knocks him down,

28:03.849 --> 28:06.018
he catches himself,

28:06.060 --> 28:08.979
hands and knees.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.190
Shot up the pipe
was the last one.

28:11.232 --> 28:12.900
Yeah, the shooter
was pissed off.

28:12.942 --> 28:14.318
A "fuck you" shot.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.112
Oh, yeah. They knew each other.

28:16.153 --> 28:18.030
There are case files in here.

28:18.072 --> 28:19.448
Briefs.

28:19.490 --> 28:22.118
Notes, depos...

28:22.159 --> 28:24.912
We're going to need
a daylight grid search

28:24.954 --> 28:26.789
to even hope to find that slug.

28:26.831 --> 28:29.834
-Is that Elias's?
-It was open.

28:30.835 --> 28:32.545
You need a warrant for that.

28:32.586 --> 28:34.547
Attorney-client stuff.

28:34.588 --> 28:37.466
We need a warrant,
she's right.

28:37.508 --> 28:39.135
Book it.

28:39.176 --> 28:42.138
Give us something else, Bosch,
or send us home.

28:42.179 --> 28:44.014
See if you can find his car.

28:53.441 --> 28:55.109
Solve it?

28:55.151 --> 28:57.862
Look, Captain, I'm not saying
one of your guys did it,

28:57.903 --> 29:00.030
but you know I'm gonna find out
if they did.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.158
-Did what?
-Tampered with the crime scene.

29:02.199 --> 29:05.202
Tried to make it look
like a robbery.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.954
Put up a smokescreen in case
it was a cop who did it.

29:06.996 --> 29:08.372
Never happened.

29:08.414 --> 29:09.874
Good.

29:09.915 --> 29:12.001
You an IA asshole now?

29:13.794 --> 29:16.172
I hate to even bring it up,
'cause you can imagine

29:16.213 --> 29:18.382
how that would play
if I had to report that

29:18.424 --> 29:19.800
to Chief Irving, or God forbid,

29:19.842 --> 29:21.635
the press got ahold of it,
because it was,

29:21.677 --> 29:23.304
you know, leaked?

29:23.345 --> 29:26.974
Fuck off.

29:36.692 --> 29:39.069
We need to split up IA.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.946
Yeah, but keep 'em close.

29:40.988 --> 29:44.492
I'll take Snyder,
you take Lincoln.

29:45.743 --> 29:48.078
Hey, youngblood, head back

29:48.120 --> 29:50.206
to the house,
get cracking on those warrants.

29:50.247 --> 29:52.208
Bradbury, briefcase,
his car and his phone.

29:53.834 --> 29:56.086
We checked the lots
near the Bradbury.

29:56.128 --> 29:59.048
Maybe he takes the Metro in.

29:59.089 --> 30:02.176
Or I guess me and Gabby could
walk around downtown all night

30:02.218 --> 30:03.886
randomly pushing key fobs.

30:03.928 --> 30:06.222
Might catch a break
and trip over that nine slug

30:06.263 --> 30:08.682
-from the second victim.
-

30:10.684 --> 30:13.479
-Yeah, this is Bosch.
-It's Garwood.

30:13.521 --> 30:15.481
- -One
of my guys got an anonymous tip.

30:15.523 --> 30:17.274
Caller said a, uh,

30:17.316 --> 30:19.860
"detective-looking person"
tossed something in a can,

30:19.902 --> 30:21.320
corner of Fourth and Hill.

30:21.362 --> 30:23.155
Detective-looking person?

30:23.197 --> 30:25.658
Caller looked in, saw
your missing watch and wallet,

30:25.699 --> 30:27.660
but didn't touch them.

30:27.701 --> 30:30.538
Wild guess--
it was Rooker who got the tip?

30:33.707 --> 30:36.043
Jesus Christ.

31:05.072 --> 31:07.992
You want to tell me
what's going on with that?

31:08.033 --> 31:10.286
When I think the time's right.

32:28.906 --> 32:31.909
It's under the bed. Hmm.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.827
I heard it slide

32:33.869 --> 32:36.288
off the table when you did
that Cirque de Soleil move.

32:36.330 --> 32:37.998
Excuse me?

32:38.040 --> 32:40.626
30.

32:40.668 --> 32:42.920
-I want to be home
when the boys wake up. -Oh.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.546
Sure. You don't want them
to think

32:44.588 --> 32:46.382
-Mom and Dad like each other
again. -No.

32:46.423 --> 32:48.676
-We like the hell
out of each other. -Hmm.

32:48.717 --> 32:52.137
What it adds up to now--
that's what's undetermined.

32:52.179 --> 32:54.932
Not for me.

32:54.973 --> 32:58.811
You pick a suit for Monday?

32:58.852 --> 33:02.523
Uh, it's gonna be light duty
for a while.

33:02.564 --> 33:04.274
-Desk work.
-Uh-huh.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.151
Seriously.

33:06.193 --> 33:08.529
You still okay
with covering my open house?

33:08.570 --> 33:11.824
Yeah, but, sooner or later...

33:11.865 --> 33:13.951
You're still sleeping, baby.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.036
It's just a dream.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.006
Never done one of these before.

33:40.853 --> 33:43.564
Sir, I'm Detective Bosch.
This is Sergeant Snyder...

33:43.605 --> 33:45.816
We know why you're here.

33:45.858 --> 33:48.068
00 a.m.

33:48.110 --> 33:50.988
Some asshole says,
"Your husband's dead,

33:51.029 --> 33:53.240
and I'm dancing,"
then hangs up.

33:53.282 --> 33:54.825
Well, I'm sorry
we couldn't get here quicker.

33:54.867 --> 33:56.994
Martin

33:57.035 --> 34:00.038
Five, six calls later,
we turned off the phone.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.582
You guys finally did it,
didn't you?

34:01.623 --> 34:03.375
It was one of you motherfuckers,
wasn't it?

34:03.417 --> 34:05.127
Sir, if you have

34:05.169 --> 34:07.546
any information as to who might
have done this, please tell me.

34:07.588 --> 34:10.758
The fuck difference
would it make?

34:10.799 --> 34:12.342
Where?

34:12.384 --> 34:15.053
Bunker Hill, ma'am.
Angel's Flight.

34:17.055 --> 34:19.433
Any idea why he'd be up there?

34:19.475 --> 34:21.769
How?

34:23.020 --> 34:24.897
Someone shot him.

34:31.278 --> 34:33.697
We have an apartment
near The Broad.

34:36.158 --> 34:39.286
Howard always stays there
before a trial.

34:41.830 --> 34:44.166
I wasn't expecting him
last night.

34:44.208 --> 34:47.586
When was the last time
you spoke to him?

34:50.798 --> 34:54.635
Mrs. Elias,
we'd like to come in,

34:54.676 --> 34:56.637
tell you what we know
about what happened,

34:56.678 --> 34:59.473
ask a few more questions
that can maybe steer us

34:59.515 --> 35:01.558
in the direction
to find who did this.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.227
And then we'll be on our way.

35:03.268 --> 35:05.270
-Cops did this.
-Martin.

35:05.312 --> 35:08.732
-Get the fuck out of here!
-Martin.

35:20.953 --> 35:23.372
Sir, what you said
about cops doing this?

35:23.413 --> 35:25.874
-Black Guardian cops.
-Let me tell you something.

35:25.916 --> 35:28.001
Any police officer
who might have had reason

35:28.043 --> 35:30.170
to cause your father harm
is gonna be a suspect.

35:30.212 --> 35:35.676
And if I can prove one did it--
that's a killer, not a cop.

35:53.610 --> 35:56.697
-Chief

35:56.738 --> 35:58.615
Walking out as we speak.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.243
Well, I have a press conference
in ten minutes.

36:01.285 --> 36:03.287
Now, would it be inaccurate
to say first indications

36:03.328 --> 36:04.788
are that robbery was the motive?

36:04.830 --> 36:06.248
You've been talking
to Captain Garwood.

36:06.290 --> 36:07.958
Yes or no?

36:08.000 --> 36:10.168
It wasn't a robbery.

36:11.587 --> 36:13.422
What about the missing watch
and wallet?

36:13.463 --> 36:15.424
Removed and discarded nearby.

36:15.465 --> 36:19.511
You want me to tell you
what the PIO wants to hear?

36:19.553 --> 36:21.513
-That it wasn't a cop?
-I want to know

36:21.555 --> 36:23.390
as soon as you have
something concrete, Detective.

36:23.432 --> 36:25.767
Yes, sir.

36:25.809 --> 36:28.145
What?

36:28.186 --> 36:29.688
Bosch, if you've got a problem
with me...

36:29.730 --> 36:32.399
-I don't have a problem.
-The 128

36:32.441 --> 36:34.151
complaint
I wrote you up on last year--

36:34.192 --> 36:36.570
my finding was it was factual.

36:36.612 --> 36:39.239
Should have been sustained,
and you should have taken days.

36:39.281 --> 36:41.909
-What's your point?
-Got quashed upstairs.

36:41.950 --> 36:44.202
Chief's an enigma.

36:49.207 --> 36:52.169
Just say his watch and wallet
were missing from the scene.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.629
It's factually true.

36:53.670 --> 36:55.339
Let the press draw
their own conclusions.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.174
Whenever I'm with you,
I feel like

36:57.215 --> 36:58.884
I'm in a washing machine
spin cycle.

36:58.926 --> 37:00.469
Rinse and repeat.

37:00.510 --> 37:03.347
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

37:03.388 --> 37:04.848
...both
pronounced dead at the scene

37:04.890 --> 37:06.600
in what looks like,
at first blush,

37:06.642 --> 37:10.062
an armed robbery, according
to LAPD Chief Irvin Irving,

37:10.103 --> 37:12.481
in a press conference
moments ago.

37:12.522 --> 37:15.442
A former prosecutor, Elias
earned a national reputation

37:15.484 --> 37:18.278
as a civil rights lawyer,
winning record settlements

37:18.320 --> 37:20.948
-for alleged victims
of police brutality. -

37:20.989 --> 37:23.116
Someone needs
to police the police.

37:23.158 --> 37:25.702
Someone needs to be willing

37:25.744 --> 37:27.871
to unravel the fabric
of institutional racism

37:27.913 --> 37:30.791
- -that continues to allow

37:30.832 --> 37:33.210
atrocities like Black Guardian
to be perpetrated

37:33.251 --> 37:35.212
on young men of color
in this city.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.630
Ironically,

37:36.672 --> 37:39.132
Elias was due
to begin opening arguments

37:39.174 --> 37:40.759
Monday morning
in the closely-watched case

37:40.801 --> 37:43.762
- -representing
plaintiff Michael Harris.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.650
Is Bosch here yet?

37:56.692 --> 37:58.485
He and Jimmy are doing
death notifications.

37:58.527 --> 38:01.279
All right. Tell him
to come see me when he gets in.

38:01.321 --> 38:04.116
-Body in Lake Hollywood. -What?
That sounds like a suicide.

38:04.157 --> 38:05.951
Can't patrol handle it?

38:05.993 --> 38:08.245
Look, I don't want you guys
going out on some bullshit call.

38:08.286 --> 38:11.081
Sounds like a suicide.

38:11.123 --> 38:14.126
Except
for the missing-his-head part.

38:31.309 --> 38:34.271
Lieutenant Ruiz
would like a word.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.273
-With the temporary captain?
-Yes.

38:36.314 --> 38:40.485
Uh, something about new patrol
SUVs that Captain Cooper

38:40.527 --> 38:43.238
was supposed to follow up on.

38:44.865 --> 38:47.743
You gonna work out of here
or your office?

38:49.494 --> 38:51.288
-My office.
-Your office.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.831
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

38:57.127 --> 38:59.421
-Way to go, Mad!
-

38:59.463 --> 39:02.257
Hey, it's okay. Come on, Elite!

39:02.299 --> 39:03.967
-Let's get the ball back!
-

39:06.762 --> 39:09.723
Tell me you're on your way
with a large chai.

39:09.765 --> 39:11.767
With a double shot
of Johnny Black in it.

39:11.808 --> 39:14.227
Not gonna make it.
I caught a case.

39:14.269 --> 39:16.396
-Tell Mads I'm sorry. -I thought
you weren't on rotation.

39:16.438 --> 39:19.691
I wasn't. I'm not.
Special circumstances.

39:19.733 --> 39:21.693
I get it.

39:21.735 --> 39:23.904
How they doing?

39:23.945 --> 39:26.823
Club volleyball's supposed to be
harder than high school, right?

39:26.865 --> 39:28.241
Ooh, that bad?

39:28.283 --> 39:29.451
I'll tell her, Harry.

39:29.493 --> 39:32.037
I got to get back to it.

39:32.079 --> 39:34.039
Okay.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.168
I don't even want

39:38.210 --> 39:39.711
to contemplate
how this city will react

39:39.753 --> 39:42.380
if it was a police officer
who killed Howard Elias.

39:42.422 --> 39:45.383
It goes where it goes.
We're not gonna hide anything.

39:45.425 --> 39:47.052
Of course not.

39:47.094 --> 39:49.304
But all the more reason
for a quick resolution.

39:49.346 --> 39:51.640
Who's leading the investigation?

39:51.681 --> 39:53.975
Harry Bosch. Hollywood Homicide.

39:54.017 --> 39:56.895
We crossed paths last night.

39:56.937 --> 39:58.855
You and Bosch?

39:58.897 --> 40:00.857
He's a strong flavor.

40:00.899 --> 40:03.193
You have no idea.

40:03.235 --> 40:05.821
But he's never been sued
by Howard Elias.

40:05.862 --> 40:07.489
How the hell did Bosch
manage that?

40:07.531 --> 40:12.494
I'd like you to have him keep me
directly looped in, Irv.

40:12.536 --> 40:14.538
A robust civilian oversight

40:14.579 --> 40:17.374
of this investigation
couldn't hurt.

40:17.415 --> 40:20.418
No, it couldn't.

40:35.183 --> 40:37.894
I'm gonna Airbnb the shit out
of this place.

40:37.936 --> 40:39.312
Mm-hmm.

40:39.354 --> 40:40.939
No grass. I like it.

40:40.981 --> 40:43.441
-Water ain't cheap.
-Mm-hmm.

40:43.483 --> 40:45.360
Old lady died last month.

40:45.402 --> 40:47.779
Daughter's selling this quick--
she needs the dough.

40:47.821 --> 40:51.783
Tell your wife I'll offer
15% below asking, all cash.

40:51.825 --> 40:53.451
Ex-wife. And you should
call her yourself.

40:53.493 --> 40:54.452
-I'm just...
-Whoa!

40:54.494 --> 40:56.454
Universal Studios.

40:56.496 --> 40:59.166
Sweet.

41:01.168 --> 41:03.336
Aw, fuck.

41:26.151 --> 41:28.111
-Hey.
-Hey.

41:28.153 --> 41:30.822
-You still waiting
on a warrant? -Yup.

41:30.864 --> 41:33.033
Judge Houghton docked Pierce
for style points.

41:33.074 --> 41:34.826
Oh. Houghton's
a pain in the balls.

41:34.868 --> 41:36.369
-He resubmit?
-Yeah.

41:36.411 --> 41:37.537
But now Her Honor has
seen fit

41:37.579 --> 41:39.247
to appoint a Special Master.

41:39.289 --> 41:40.999
Shit.
Who's she sending?

41:41.041 --> 41:42.334
I have no idea.

41:42.375 --> 41:44.586
Weekend.

41:44.628 --> 41:46.171
This could take
a little while.

41:46.213 --> 41:47.964
I left word with the chief.

41:48.006 --> 41:49.090
Maybe he can goose Houghton.

41:51.468 --> 41:53.845
Looky what I found.

41:56.598 --> 41:58.892
My sister's charging me
$100 to watch my daughter today.

41:58.934 --> 42:00.185
Her own fucking niece.

42:00.227 --> 42:02.062
Lawyerly looking watch
and wallet.

42:03.563 --> 42:05.190
Guess RHD thinks it was a cop.

42:05.232 --> 42:07.484
Maybe just covering the bases.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.819
Nah. They're worried
it's one of them.

42:09.861 --> 42:13.073
I got to worry about you
not making RHD?

42:13.114 --> 42:15.116
Not me, man.

42:15.158 --> 42:16.952
I'm over that.

42:16.993 --> 42:18.787
You know what?

42:18.828 --> 42:20.455
No sense both of us
wasting our time here.

42:20.497 --> 42:22.415
I'll take my IA to Hollywood
and see if we can

42:22.457 --> 42:24.376
expedite the other warrants.

42:24.417 --> 42:26.753
And, uh, start tracking down
our Black Guardian cops

42:26.795 --> 42:28.797
-for questioning. All right?
-Cool.

42:31.424 --> 42:33.385
Do you think you can't
trust me?

42:33.426 --> 42:35.762
The watch and wallet

42:37.555 --> 42:39.849
I want you to wait here
for the Special Master.

42:39.891 --> 42:42.143
Where are you going?

42:42.185 --> 42:43.228
Detective.

42:45.814 --> 42:47.899
Fucking Bosch.

42:47.941 --> 42:51.069
Private card game?
That's off-pattern.

42:51.111 --> 42:53.530
They come, drop money
for ten days, go home.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.490
Losing stings,
even if it's on purpose.

42:55.532 --> 42:56.866
Maybe they just want
to play for real.

42:56.908 --> 42:59.536
Charter for Beijing
left this morning.

42:59.577 --> 43:02.372
Passenger manifest has
the whole group headed for home.

43:02.414 --> 43:03.373
Manifest could be wrong.

43:03.415 --> 43:05.917
Okay. Well,

43:05.959 --> 43:07.544
we can go play--
let's see who's there.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.754
If there's no one there
you're interested in,

43:09.796 --> 43:12.048
I'll just win Uncle Sam's money
and go home.

43:12.090 --> 43:14.509
And that's it.
Nothing fancy.

43:14.551 --> 43:18.388
I'm just an asset.
Fancy's not my job.

43:24.769 --> 43:26.229
What about Reggie?

43:26.271 --> 43:28.231
My people in Hong Kong
can't locate him.

43:28.273 --> 43:30.400
What does that mean?

43:30.442 --> 43:31.860
My guess--
he's either disappeared

43:31.901 --> 43:33.278
or he's been disappeared.

43:33.320 --> 43:35.155
Oh, shit.

43:35.196 --> 43:37.324
It's China. Triads.
Could be anything.

43:37.365 --> 43:38.533
Or it could be us.

43:38.575 --> 43:41.161
No, we-- you cleared his family.

43:41.202 --> 43:42.287
We haven't gone near him.

43:44.581 --> 43:46.374
What am I gonna tell Maddie?

43:48.001 --> 43:50.378
-You'll keep looking?
-Yes.

43:50.420 --> 43:53.548
-You'll let me know.
-Mm-hmm.

43:53.590 --> 43:55.884
Thanks for being straight
with me.

43:57.802 --> 43:59.804
You gotta sign.

44:03.058 --> 44:04.100
It's for the money.

44:04.142 --> 44:06.394
-Count it.
-I trust you.

44:43.640 --> 44:45.392
-You Central?
-That's us.

44:45.433 --> 44:47.685
I'm Bosch.

44:49.562 --> 44:52.148
Something holding up
my grid search?

44:52.190 --> 44:54.359
We're waiting on two more guys.

44:54.401 --> 44:58.822
You know there's a clock
on this type of thing.

44:58.863 --> 45:01.491
We're moving about as fast
as he deserves.

45:01.533 --> 45:05.120
Sorry, I mistook you for cops.
