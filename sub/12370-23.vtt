YOU WON A CITY COUNCIL POST.

WHY IS EVERYONE TREATING YOU
LIKE YOU'RE THE GODFATHER?

BE A SHAME IF SOMETHING WERE

A NICE THING YOU DO FOR ME.

IT'S A FAKE OSCAR

I'M GONNA USE IT

01:30.256 --> 01:33.426

01:50.109 --> 01:52.028
BUT I'M SCARED TO TRUST IT.

01:52.111 --> 01:54.739
IT'S RIDICULOUS, BUT I FEEL LIKE
SOMETHING AWFUL WILL HAPPEN

01:54.823 --> 01:57.075
THE MOMENT I JUST COME OUT
AND SAY I'M HAPPY,

01:57.158 --> 01:59.035

I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM
IN MONTHS, AND NOW

02:07.502 --> 02:10.547

02:10.630 --> 02:12.715
OH, I SHOULD GET THIS OVER WITH

02:12.799 --> 02:14.759
AND TELL HIM ABOUT MITCH.

02:14.843 --> 02:17.387
BUT I CAN'T.
- WHY NOT?

02:17.470 --> 02:19.556
- I CAN'T VIDEO CHAT LIKE THIS.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.558
YOU HAVE TO LOOK YOUR SEXIEST
WHEN YOU'RE TELLING A MAN

02:21.641 --> 02:23.351

JUST REMEMBER, YOUR RIGHT SIDE
IS YOUR BEST,

02:50.336 --> 02:52.422
NEVER SHOW THE LEFT SIDE
OF YOUR FACE.

02:52.505 --> 02:54.048

WITH MY LEFT SIDE?

02:54.132 --> 02:56.301
- NOTHING, IT'S GORGEOUS.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.720

JUST HAPPENED.

WE CAN'T FLIRT OUR WAY
OUT OF TICKETS IN CLEVELAND?

03:05.560 --> 03:07.770
WHY EVEN LIVE HERE?

03:07.854 --> 03:09.439
- NO, IT WAS A FEMALE COP.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.774
AND I GOT CAUGHT UP IN
THE WHOLE ELKA GODFATHER THING.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.110
AND I SAID, IF THE TICKET
WOULD SOMEHOW GO AWAY,

03:14.193 --> 03:16.112
THAT ELKA WOULD GIVE HER
A PROMOTION.

03:16.195 --> 03:16.738
NOW SHE'S GOING
TO INVESTIGATE ELKA.

03:16.821 --> 03:18.781
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

03:18.865 --> 03:21.075
- I'M WEAK.

NOW TOO.

03:53.232 --> 03:55.818

I'VE MET SOMEONE, AND,
WELL...

I'M IN LOVE.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.521
IS THIS THE FACE OF A MAN
WHO JUST HEARD ME SAY,

04:31.604 --> 04:34.607
"I'M IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE ELSE"?

04:34.691 --> 04:36.526

ANALYZING THIS FOR TWO DAYS NOW,

04:44.993 --> 04:47.578
AND, UNTIL YOU REACH HIM, YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO KNOW WHAT HE HEARD.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.039
- I THINK YOU SHOULD
JUST DELETE IT AND MOVE ON.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.666
- I WANT TO, BUT FOR SOME REASON

04:51.749 --> 04:54.043
I CAN'T SEEM TO DELETE
HIS STUPID FACE.

HAVE FEELINGS FOR HIM?

05:03.970 --> 05:08.558
I'M WAITING AND HOPING
FOR MY MAN TOO.

05:08.641 --> 05:12.603

05:12.687 --> 05:14.856
- BUT HE'S MADE OF GOLD,
AND HE HAS NO OPINIONS,

05:14.939 --> 05:16.899

MIGHT ENJOY THE IRONY.

09:39.203 --> 09:40.663
HIS NAME IS MITCH AND--

09:40.746 --> 09:43.708
- I'VE NEVER CARED
FOR THAT NAME.

09:43.791 --> 09:48.170
THERE'S THE STORY IN THE BIBLE
OF A MITCH

09:48.254 --> 09:49.672
WHO BROKE WOMEN'S HEARTS

09:49.755 --> 09:55.011
AND, UM, FORNICATED WITH GOATS.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.013
- REALLY?
- MM.

09:57.096 --> 09:59.098
- WELL, MY MITCH
IS NOT LIKE THAT.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.976
WHEN I FIRST SAW HIM, I HAD
THE FEELING THAT HE WAS THE MAN

10:02.059 --> 10:04.353
I WAS GOING TO MARRY.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.564
I THINK HE'S MY SOUL MATE.

10:06.647 --> 10:08.899
- DID YOU EVER THINK SIMON
WAS YOUR SOUL MATE?

10:08.983 --> 10:10.359
- I DID.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.112
AND I FELT HAPPY AND FULFILLED
WHEN HE CAME BACK.

10:13.195 --> 10:14.864
THEN HE LEFT.

10:14.947 --> 10:15.906
HE ALWAYS LEAVES.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.366
THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.

10:17.450 --> 10:20.202
- DID HE LEAVE
FOR SOME VILE REASON?

10:20.286 --> 10:22.038
- NO.

10:22.121 --> 10:24.582
HE STOPPED BEING A PAPARAZZI
FOR ME AND LEFT TO DO SOMETHING

10:24.665 --> 10:27.710
NOBLE WITH HIS LIFE SO HIS
GRANDSON WOULD BE PROUD OF HIM.

10:27.793 --> 10:31.881
- SO YOUR ORIGINAL SOUL MATE
IS A HERO.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.343
- MAYBE.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.219
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU MISS HIM.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.722
I BET HE MISSES YOU TOO.

10:39.805 --> 10:42.516
- I FEEL CONFUSED.

10:42.600 --> 10:47.021
- WELL, AS THE CHURCH SAYS,
IT'S GOOD TO DOUBT.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.195
- YOU'RE A VERY UNUSUAL PRIEST.

10:54.278 --> 10:59.325
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
NEW POPE, NEW RULES.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.704
- ELKA'S GOING TO FIND OUT
I'M THE RAT.

11:03.788 --> 11:04.705
- WELL, SO WHAT?

11:04.789 --> 11:06.207
SHE'S NOT REALLY THE GODFATHER.

11:06.290 --> 11:07.833
SHE'S NOT GOING TO DO
ANYTHING TO YOU.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.460
- BUT SHE'S GOING TO BE
SO DISAPPOINTED IN ME.

11:09.543 --> 11:11.128
I MEAN, I'M THE GOOD ONE.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.296
I'M THE SWEET ONE.

11:12.380 --> 11:16.050
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

11:16.133 --> 11:19.553
- NO, I DON'T,
BUT IT SOUNDS DULL.

11:19.637 --> 11:20.971
OH, LOOK, THERE'S JOY.

11:21.055 --> 11:22.973
SO HOW DID THINGS GO
WITH THE PRIEST?

11:23.057 --> 11:23.933
- TERRIBLE.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.893
I WENT THERE HOPING TO GET SIMON
OFF MY MIND.

11:25.976 --> 11:27.603
NOW HE'S ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT.

11:27.686 --> 11:29.939
I ALMOST THOUGHT
I SMELLED HIS COLOGNE.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.482
I'M SORRY, GUYS.

11:31.565 --> 11:32.650
I'M NOT GOOD COMPANY RIGHT NOW.

11:32.733 --> 11:35.778
I'M JUST GONNA TAKE MY WINE
TO GO.

11:48.833 --> 11:52.253
- WOW, JOY REALLY SEEMS
TORN ABOUT SIMON.

11:52.336 --> 11:53.629
- I KNOW.

11:53.712 --> 11:54.839
ISN'T IT GREAT?

11:54.922 --> 11:57.174
THE SEED OF DOUBT
HAS BEEN PLANTED.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.635
SHE'S WEAK AND VULNERABLE
AND DRINKING HEAVILY.

11:59.718 --> 12:03.431
SHE'S THE WOMAN
I FELL IN LOVE WITH.

12:03.514 --> 12:06.183
- I'M NOT SO SURE THIS
IS IN JOY'S BEST INTEREST.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.853
I'M SORRY, SIMON,
BUT I'M ON TEAM MITCH NOW.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.980
- WELL, I'M SWITCHING
TO TEAM SIMON.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.815
HE SHOWS AN IMPRESSIVE RANGE

12:12.898 --> 12:14.650
AND A REAL COMMITMENT
TO HIS CHARACTER.

12:14.733 --> 12:17.153
SHE SHOULD BE WITH HIM.
- WELL PUT.

12:17.236 --> 12:20.656
SO I REMINDED HER HOW SHE USED
TO THINK I WAS HER SOUL MATE.

12:20.739 --> 12:25.453
NOW I NEED TO REMIND HER OF HOW
SHE USED TO THRILL TO MY TOUCH.

12:25.536 --> 12:29.165
- [with German accent]
JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES,<i> LIEBCHEN,</i>

12:29.248 --> 12:34.128
AND LET HANS' HANDS
SET YOU FREE.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.671
- [sighs sensually]

12:35.754 --> 12:39.675
I'M SO GRATEFUL VICTORIA
INSISTED ON THIS MASSAGE.

12:39.758 --> 12:42.928
I'VE BEEN A BIT TENSE LATELY.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.389
THERE'S SOMETHING VERY FAMILIAR
ABOUT YOUR TOUCH.

12:45.473 --> 12:46.682
- UH-UH, NO LOOKING.

12:46.765 --> 12:48.767
THE HANDS BECOME SHY.

12:48.851 --> 12:52.480
HANS' HANDS
ARE <i> UBER</i> "GE-SHY-ZINGEN."

12:52.563 --> 12:56.525
YOUR TENSENESS SUGGESTS
A LACK OF SEXUAL FULFILLMENT.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.986
JOY, TELL ME ABOUT THE SEX
THAT YOU MAKE.

12:59.069 --> 13:00.821
DON'T WORRY, I'M 100% GAY.

13:00.905 --> 13:04.200
THE SIGHT OF YOUR NAKED BODY
ACTUALLY REPULSES ME.

13:04.283 --> 13:07.661
- OH, WELL...

13:07.745 --> 13:10.498
SEX WITH MITCH
IS ACTUALLY AMAZING.

13:10.581 --> 13:12.333
AND SINCE YOU'RE GAY,

13:12.416 --> 13:17.379
I CAN TELL YOU
HE HAS THE MOST--OW!

13:17.463 --> 13:19.256
- SO WHAT I AM HEARING IS,

13:19.340 --> 13:22.301
HE'S NOT THE BEST SEX
YOU'VE EVER HAD.

13:22.384 --> 13:24.553
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT!

13:24.637 --> 13:26.722
WELL, THERE IS ANOTHER MAN
FROM MY PAST

13:26.805 --> 13:29.850
WHO IS MITCH'S EQUAL, SEXUALLY.

13:29.934 --> 13:33.062
- I'VE PUT THE THOUGHT OF THIS
WONDERFUL MAN IN YOUR MIND.

13:33.145 --> 13:36.357
I CREATED DOUBT AND CONFUSION
IN YOUR HEAD.

13:36.440 --> 13:40.861
OH, I FEEL TERRIBLE.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.947
WELL, I'VE AWAKENED
ALL OF THE OLD FEELINGS,

13:43.030 --> 13:46.534
AND I REMINDED HER THAT
I'M THE BEST SEX SHE EVER HAD.

13:46.617 --> 13:50.412
- I DON'T THINK I COULD NAME
A BEST PARTNER.

13:50.496 --> 13:54.333
TO ME ORGASMS
ARE LIKE DOUGHNUTS.

14:04.009 --> 14:08.556
I NEVER HAD A BAD ONE.

14:08.639 --> 14:11.767
- EVEN DAY-OLDS ARE JUST FINE.

14:18.941 --> 14:21.527
- WHAT I NEED TO DO
IS TUG AT JOY'S HEART STRINGS.

14:21.610 --> 14:23.612
WE SHARE A SON AND A GRANDSON.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.906
I'VE GOT TO MAKE HER REALIZE

14:25.990 --> 14:27.992
HOW MUCH THIS CHANCE
TO BE ONE HAPPY FAMILY

14:28.075 --> 14:30.244
REALLY MEANS.

14:30.327 --> 14:31.453
- OH, THAT'S JOY!

14:31.537 --> 14:34.456
GET DOWN.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.250
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

14:36.333 --> 14:39.086
ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE,
WILBUR'S NANNY JUST QUIT.

14:39.169 --> 14:41.422
APPARENTLY, SHE WANTS
A FAMILY OF HER OWN.

14:41.505 --> 14:44.592
WELL, THIS TIME I'M HIRING
AN OLDER NANNY.

14:44.675 --> 14:50.431
SOMEONE WHO'S LOOKING AT HER
UTERUS IN THE REAR-VIEW MIRROR.

14:50.514 --> 14:53.183
- SO JOY NEEDS A NANNY.

14:53.267 --> 14:56.312
- PERHAPS A SCOTTISH NANNY.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.355
- NO.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.482
THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER IDEA.

15:00.566 --> 15:03.861
- I'M SORRY, I'M HAVING A BIT
OF TROUBLE READING YOUR RESUME.

15:03.944 --> 15:05.654
I'M A BIT BLIND RIGHT NOW.

15:05.738 --> 15:09.116
SOMEHOW MY CONTACTS
AND MY GLASSES DISAPPEARED.

15:09.199 --> 15:11.160
- [silly falsetto voice]
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, DEARIE.

15:11.243 --> 15:14.163
YOU HAVE A VERY PRETTY SQUINT.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.956
- REALLY?

15:16.040 --> 15:17.625
THANK YOU, MRS. MCCRACKEN.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.293
- OH, PLEASE.

15:19.376 --> 15:22.129
CALL ME ELSPETH.

15:26.925 --> 15:28.385
- WELL, YOU SEEM DELIGHTFUL,

15:28.469 --> 15:30.304
AND WHATEVER YOU'RE BAKING
IN THE KITCHEN SMELLS WONDERFUL.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.181
DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
FOR ME?

15:32.264 --> 15:34.183
- WELL, JUST THE ONE, DEARIE.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.477
I WAS WONDERING
ABOUT THE WHEREABOUTS

15:36.560 --> 15:38.228
OF WILBUR'S GRANDFATHER.

15:38.312 --> 15:40.856
- HE'S NO LONGER AROUND.

15:40.939 --> 15:43.525
WE WERE TOGETHER, BUT I'M
IN A NEW RELATIONSHIP NOW

15:43.609 --> 15:45.194
AND VERY HAPPY.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.862
ONWARDS AND UPWARDS, NO REGRETS.

15:46.945 --> 15:49.323
- OH, THERE'S ALWAYS REGRETS.

15:49.406 --> 15:51.992
I HAD A MAN,
MY FIRST LOVE, IN FACT.

15:52.076 --> 15:55.704
HE WAS HANDSOME
AND CRAGGY, QUITE A CATCH.

15:55.788 --> 16:00.417
BUT THEN I WAS CONSIDERED
A GREAT BEAUTY IN MY HOME TOWN.

16:00.501 --> 16:04.713
- WAS IT A SMALL TOWN?

16:04.797 --> 16:07.633
- IT WAS, BUT
I DIDN'T TREAT HIM WELL,

16:07.716 --> 16:09.218
AND I LOST HIM
TO ANOTHER WOMAN.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.929
YOU SAY YOU'RE HAPPY
WITH YOUR NEW MAN,

16:12.012 --> 16:14.390
BUT THERE MUST BE PART OF YOU

16:14.473 --> 16:16.684
THAT DREAMED
OF KEEPING YOUR CLAN TOGETHER.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.894
- I SUPPOSE SO.
- MM.

16:18.977 --> 16:20.771
JUST THINK OF THE CHRISTMASES.

16:20.854 --> 16:23.565
THE BAIRN AND HIS PARENTS
AND GRANDPARENTS

16:23.649 --> 16:25.609
ALL HANGING STOCKINGS
BY THE FIRE.

16:25.693 --> 16:31.198
WILBUR, OWEN, JOY AND...
WHAT WAS THE GRANDFATHER'S NAME?

16:31.281 --> 16:33.575
- SIMON.
- SIMON.

16:33.659 --> 16:38.747
OH, GOES SO WELL ON A SOCK.

16:38.831 --> 16:39.748
[bell chimes]

16:39.832 --> 16:42.835

16:47.172 --> 16:48.257

16:48.340 --> 16:50.175
[normal voice]
I'VE DONE IT.

16:50.259 --> 16:53.721
HER MIND, HER BODY AND HER HEART
ARE ALL A MESS, THANKS TO ME.

16:53.804 --> 16:55.431
I'M GOING TO STAY IN CLEVELAND.

16:55.514 --> 16:58.267
I'M GOING TO DO WHATEVER
IT TAKES TO WIN HER BACK.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.937
- OH, HOW ROMANTIC.

17:02.020 --> 17:05.607
- UH-OH. THOSE POTS LOOK
LIKE THEY'RE BOILING OVER.

17:05.691 --> 17:09.611
- OH, YOU'RE RIGHT, MAMIE SUE,
THEY ARE.

17:09.694 --> 17:11.280
- WHAT?

17:11.363 --> 17:14.450
I THOUGHT
I WAS JUST MAKING COOKIES.

17:14.532 --> 17:18.119
- OH, NO.
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

17:18.203 --> 17:23.000
YOU WANT ME TO SET MY BOOBS
ON FIRE LIKE MRS. DOUBTFIRE.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.835
WELL, IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN,

17:24.917 --> 17:27.963

ARE NOT MADE OF FOAM.

17:37.055 --> 17:41.810
HE HAS NO IDEA
HOW A REAL BREAST FEELS.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.896
- ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP?

17:43.979 --> 17:46.064
- [falsetto voice]
NO, EVERYTHING'S UNDER CONTROL.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.858
OH! HOT!

17:47.941 --> 17:49.943
- IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

NO, I-I DON'T THINK SO.

18:01.955 --> 18:03.624
- THERE'S SOME ON YOUR BLOUSE.

18:03.707 --> 18:07.169
- OH, YES, MY BLOUSE CORN.

18:07.252 --> 18:10.422
THE KIDDIE-WINKS LOVE IT.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.216
WELL, I JUST REMEMBERED,

18:12.299 --> 18:15.010
THERE'S ANOTHER INTERVIEW
THAT I HAVE TO GO TO.

18:15.093 --> 18:17.554
SO I'LL LEAVE YOU
WITH MY COOKIES,

18:17.638 --> 18:19.807
AND I'LL, UH, POP OFF.

18:19.890 --> 18:22.851

WELL, THAT'S NOT SO BAD.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.257
CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME?

18:53.340 --> 18:57.135

THE COUNCILWOMAN HAS ASKED ME

18:57.219 --> 19:00.597
TO TAKE YOU
ON A BOAT RIDE TOMORROW.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.894
- I JUST GOT A TEXT FROM MITCH.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.063
HE'S COMING BACK EARLY BECAUSE
HE MISSES ME SO MUCH.

19:08.146 --> 19:09.690

19:09.773 --> 19:10.774
- IT IS.

19:10.858 --> 19:12.734
I HAVE A MAN WHO COMES BACK.

WHY AM I MAKING MYSELF CRAZY

TO ME, AND SIMON IS HALFWAY

19:19.157 --> 19:23.120

EVEN THINKING ABOUT ME.

19:23.203 --> 19:26.415
ALTHOUGH, BEFORE HIS FACE FROZE,

19:26.498 --> 19:28.625
HE DID SAY HE WAS THINKING
ABOUT ME ALL THE TIME.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.670
OH, WHY CAN'T I GET HIM
OUT OF MY HEAD?

19:31.753 --> 19:33.255

TO BE HAPPY.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.757

WE ARE ON TEAM JOY.
