09:50.285 --> 09:51.329
I got something for you.
I need something.

09:51.503 --> 09:52.896
Here it is.
Here we go.

09:53.070 --> 09:54.942
Yeah, there it is.

09:55.116 --> 09:56.596
There was a murder on
North Wells a couple weeks ago.

09:56.770 --> 09:58.293
No, I can stay on Bolt, mate.

09:58.467 --> 09:59.686
I know how important it is.It's pointless, man.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.426
We're in a standstill, okay?Yeah.

10:01.557 --> 10:03.037
Better to work on something
that we can actually

10:03.211 --> 10:05.561
solve, all right?

10:07.824 --> 10:08.956
Sure.

10:11.654 --> 10:13.351
FELIX:
Hey, Joy.

10:13.525 --> 10:15.266
We just stopped by to see
Murphy, but no one was home.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.486
Is she with you?
She's not answering her phone.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.967
JOY:
Well, clearly
she doesn't want to see you

10:20.141 --> 10:22.404
because she didn't even tell you
she isn't staying with us.

10:23.884 --> 10:26.016
She's not?
Where is she staying?

10:26.190 --> 10:28.062
Look, I don't want you
anywhere near my daughter.

10:28.236 --> 10:29.063
Do you understand?

10:29.237 --> 10:30.368
What?

10:30.499 --> 10:31.848
Maybe you're the problem, Felix.

10:32.022 --> 10:33.720
Her life was totally fine

10:33.894 --> 10:34.808
until you bought Guiding Hope,
and suddenly she...

10:34.938 --> 10:36.679
Oh, really?
You think all this happened

10:36.853 --> 10:39.595
because I bought Guiding Hope?
That's...

10:39.769 --> 10:41.292
That's the... Oh, you want
to open that up right now?

10:41.466 --> 10:42.380
Stop.

10:42.511 --> 10:43.817
I don't have time for this.

10:43.947 --> 10:45.166
Just stay away from Murphy.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.602
[line clicks]Wait, Joy--

10:46.733 --> 10:47.864
[groans]

10:48.038 --> 10:49.736
Good job.

10:52.129 --> 10:53.957
If she's not there,
where the hell is she?

10:54.131 --> 10:55.306
Like I know?

10:55.480 --> 10:56.960
Let's just get some food.

10:57.134 --> 10:58.745
Figure out
where the hell she is.

10:58.919 --> 11:00.964
[engine revving]

11:01.095 --> 11:02.879
[coughing]

11:05.708 --> 11:07.754
She busted out--
that's all I know.

11:07.928 --> 11:09.756
No idea how.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.671
Literally just didn't come back
to her cell one night.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.455
So you have no clue
where she is?

11:13.629 --> 11:15.109
DEB:
No.

11:15.283 --> 11:16.632
MURPHY:
Did she say
where she would go if...?

11:16.806 --> 11:18.068
DEB:
Listen, can we just
get to it, please?

11:18.199 --> 11:19.113
Get to what?

11:19.287 --> 11:20.070
What's the
new way in?

11:20.244 --> 11:21.724
What's the plan?

11:21.855 --> 11:23.421
I kind of sort of need
some-some help.

11:23.552 --> 11:25.380
Oh, no, I'm-I'm... I'm just...

11:25.554 --> 11:26.903
I'm just looking for Paula.

11:28.209 --> 11:29.776
There's no drop plan?

11:29.950 --> 11:31.342
No, but...

11:31.516 --> 11:32.779
if, I mean,
if we find her,

11:32.953 --> 11:33.867
we can, we can
work something out.

11:33.997 --> 11:34.868
You seriously don't have
anything on you?

11:34.998 --> 11:37.218
Okay, well...

11:37.392 --> 11:39.437
if you find Paula,

11:39.568 --> 11:41.570
you just let her know

11:41.744 --> 11:43.485
that I'm gonna kill that bitch!

11:43.659 --> 11:46.096
[shouting indistinctly]

11:46.270 --> 11:47.881
I need it!

11:48.055 --> 11:50.971
I'm gonna kill her!
I'm gonna kill her!

11:56.890 --> 11:58.979
That was your big plan?
It went really well.

12:00.458 --> 12:01.938
You enjoying this?No.

12:02.112 --> 12:03.679
I am done listening
to you, though.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.594
Look, I don't really think
you're allowed

12:05.768 --> 12:06.595
to be done
listening to me.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.205
Mm, I'm the one
driving, so...

12:08.379 --> 12:10.164
Yeah, and I'm sure you have
some brilliant idea

12:10.338 --> 12:11.818
of how you're gonna
find Paula, huh?

12:11.992 --> 12:13.471
I'll go talk to Reggie
and see if I can get him

12:13.645 --> 12:15.386
to tell me where Paula is.Oh. Reggie.

12:15.560 --> 12:16.997
Yeah, 'cause yesterday he
wouldn't tell you anything.

12:17.171 --> 12:18.346
But today he's
just gonna confess

12:18.476 --> 12:19.695
all his thoughts
and feelings, huh?

12:19.869 --> 12:20.391
Yesterday, I didn't
know we had

12:20.565 --> 12:21.958
a prison supply problem.

12:22.132 --> 12:23.568
So?

12:23.743 --> 12:25.570
So I know how much money

12:25.745 --> 12:27.485
they're losing
by not having an in.

12:27.659 --> 12:29.226
I'll tell them I can
get it flowing again.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.706
But I'll need
to talk to Paula

12:30.837 --> 12:32.403
to get to know
the lay of the land.

12:32.577 --> 12:33.404
Okay.

12:33.578 --> 12:34.623
Like I said,

12:34.797 --> 12:35.972
I'm done listening to you.

12:42.587 --> 12:44.633
What did I say?

12:44.807 --> 12:46.548
Oh, my...

12:46.722 --> 12:48.506
Is this suitable
for your vehicle?

12:48.680 --> 12:50.247
I'm just telling you to
put feet where feet go.

12:50.421 --> 12:52.293
Oh, I'll show you
where my foot can go.

12:53.424 --> 12:54.991
I don't know.

12:55.165 --> 12:56.950
I'm telling you it's the
only thing that makes sense.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.734
That Murphy's
selling drugs again?

12:58.865 --> 13:00.910
Yeah, think about it.

13:01.084 --> 13:02.520
She just had everyone
she's ever met

13:02.694 --> 13:03.826
tell an entire jury

13:04.000 --> 13:05.306
that she's the worst person
in the world

13:05.480 --> 13:07.961
and deserves to rot in prison.
So she figures

13:08.135 --> 13:10.398
she'll just be this person that
everyone already thinks she is.

13:10.528 --> 13:12.530
You know how self-destructive
she can be.

13:16.056 --> 13:17.884
Yeah.

13:18.058 --> 13:20.974
Okay. We don't know
where she's living.

13:21.104 --> 13:22.323
She's definitely
not answering her calls.

13:22.497 --> 13:23.715
Wait. Whoa.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.108
What about
those Task Champ guys?

13:25.282 --> 13:26.457
What about the Task Champ guys?

13:26.631 --> 13:27.894
At the cabin, I heard the cop

13:28.068 --> 13:29.634
say that they were
the ones dealing, right?

13:29.765 --> 13:31.549
Uh-huh.So if she wanted
to get back in,

13:31.723 --> 13:33.334
maybe she'd go to them, I mean,
that's, that's what I would do.

13:33.464 --> 13:34.988
Yeah.
Huh?

13:35.162 --> 13:37.120
Maybe.

13:37.294 --> 13:39.079
We can order
some pills from them.

13:39.209 --> 13:40.994
See if the dealer knows her?It's worth a shot.

13:41.124 --> 13:42.822
WAITRESS:
Here you go.

13:45.215 --> 13:47.000
$16.92.

13:48.218 --> 13:50.655
I think I have...

13:51.874 --> 13:53.441
Five...

13:53.571 --> 13:55.399
six, seven, eighty...

13:55.573 --> 13:57.358
three.
How about you?

13:57.532 --> 13:58.489
I have a ten.

13:58.663 --> 13:59.839
That's it.
Perfect.

14:01.666 --> 14:03.755
Perfect.

14:03.930 --> 14:06.019
We are literally out of money.

14:06.193 --> 14:08.760
Almost out of gas, which we
can't get more of, by the way,

14:08.935 --> 14:11.285
because, like I said,
we are literally out of money.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.504
Not literally.
We have 91 cents left.

14:15.028 --> 14:17.595
And don't you think that
Murphy's life kind of supersedes

14:17.726 --> 14:19.510
our financial situation, Max?

14:22.905 --> 14:24.602
Yeah.

14:24.733 --> 14:27.083
Okay, let's go.

14:40.270 --> 14:41.532
Wait here.

14:41.706 --> 14:42.533
Dude,
I'm coming with you.

14:42.707 --> 14:43.752
I could talk
to the guy.

14:43.926 --> 14:44.753
You're not talking to anyone.

14:44.927 --> 14:47.060
Oh, my God.

14:47.234 --> 14:49.976
Stay.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.159
Reggie here?

15:00.290 --> 15:02.336
Mm, he's on a call.

15:03.424 --> 15:04.904
I can wait.

15:06.557 --> 15:08.690
Hmm.

15:18.308 --> 15:20.006
[lock clicking repeatedly]

15:25.011 --> 15:27.100
Okay.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.384
Hello?

15:50.558 --> 15:52.038
Is someone there?

15:52.212 --> 15:53.953
I'll looking
for Task Champ.

15:59.784 --> 16:01.961
By any chance...

16:02.135 --> 16:04.137
did you just get out of jail?

16:04.267 --> 16:06.487
Yeah.

16:06.661 --> 16:08.663
Yeah, yeah, I-I did.

16:08.837 --> 16:10.578
I guess I won't be doing
any more trips

16:10.708 --> 16:12.362
to the blind library.

16:12.493 --> 16:14.234
The place was a trip.

16:14.408 --> 16:15.931
Okay. Ah.

16:16.105 --> 16:18.716
So you're, uh, you helped
with Operation...

16:18.890 --> 16:20.283
Pride and Prejudice?Oh, yeah.

16:20.457 --> 16:21.719
One of the strangest jobs

16:21.850 --> 16:23.069
I've ever done,
I got to say.

16:23.243 --> 16:24.635
[laughing]

16:29.597 --> 16:30.946
Reggie?

16:31.120 --> 16:32.861
Can I talk to you for a second?

16:34.384 --> 16:35.864
Shouldn't you be
on a job?

16:36.038 --> 16:38.258
Yeah, I just, um...

16:38.388 --> 16:41.174
I heard you had a supply problem
with the prisons.

16:41.348 --> 16:44.307
I know how much money you're
losing, and I can fix it.

16:44.481 --> 16:46.005
[laughs]

16:46.179 --> 16:47.354
♪ But I don't mind... ♪

16:47.528 --> 16:49.095
We're good.

16:49.269 --> 16:51.401
What-what do you mean
you're good?

16:51.575 --> 16:53.621
I just think that if you
heard my plan, you would...

16:55.144 --> 16:58.017
The dude who worked there
had no idea I was even there.

16:58.191 --> 16:59.540
Like, he actually
couldn't see anything.

16:59.670 --> 17:00.976
It is wild.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.891
Um, listen.

17:03.065 --> 17:04.588
Uh, it's Trevor, right?

17:04.762 --> 17:06.112
Um, so...

17:06.286 --> 17:09.115
Deb gave me something
important for Paula,

17:09.289 --> 17:10.855
but she doesn't know
where Paula's staying.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.988
That's why I came here.

17:13.162 --> 17:15.295
Yeah, I'm sort of
the only person who does know.

17:15.469 --> 17:17.688
Oh, is that right?

17:17.862 --> 17:19.342
I do her dinner drops.

17:19.516 --> 17:21.344
You do? Okay.

17:21.518 --> 17:22.693
I can bring
whatever it is tomorrow.

17:22.867 --> 17:24.086
Um...

17:24.260 --> 17:25.957
it is a little time-sensitive.

17:26.132 --> 17:28.917
Uh, and I'm-I'm supposed
to give it to her personally.

17:29.091 --> 17:31.354
So do you think you could
just take me there?

17:31.528 --> 17:33.226
Right now?

17:34.662 --> 17:36.664
I guess you can't see where
you're going anyway, right?

17:36.838 --> 17:38.231
[both laugh]Yeah.

17:38.405 --> 17:40.146
Come on!

17:43.105 --> 17:45.586
[sighs]

17:45.760 --> 17:46.717
You like
buffalo wings?

17:46.891 --> 17:48.937
Who doesn't?

17:51.287 --> 17:53.159
Well, we could go
for some later.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.074
Sure.

17:57.815 --> 18:00.122
Where the hell are you going?

18:00.253 --> 18:01.993
I told you to stay
in the car!

18:02.168 --> 18:04.257
It's fine,
just go, go ahead.

18:04.431 --> 18:05.562
Come on, man, this is a joke.Who's he?

18:05.736 --> 18:06.955
I don't know, but
let's go. Go, go, go.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.478
I thought you were alone.

18:08.609 --> 18:09.958
I am alone.
I don't know who that is.

18:10.132 --> 18:11.394
Murphy!Stop it.

18:11.568 --> 18:12.482
Get out of the car, get!Darnell, stop it.

18:12.613 --> 18:13.701
Darnell, stop it.Out!

18:13.831 --> 18:15.181
Get out
of the car!

18:15.355 --> 18:16.834
Um, just...

18:17.008 --> 18:18.314
I'm serious. Get out now.

18:19.968 --> 18:21.100
[tires screech]

18:33.373 --> 18:34.591
Damn it! I lost him.

18:34.765 --> 18:36.419
Doesn't even matter.

18:36.593 --> 18:38.117
Even if we followed him,
he's not going back to Paula's.

18:38.291 --> 18:40.075
He was only going back there
for me.

18:40.206 --> 18:43.209
And you ruined it.Okay, I got it.

18:43.383 --> 18:44.949
How often does
he go to Paula's?

18:45.080 --> 18:47.430
I don't know.
I don't know his schedule.

18:47.604 --> 18:49.737
He's, like, her food guy.
He goes once a day.

18:49.867 --> 18:50.868
He brings her dinner.Her food guy.

18:50.999 --> 18:52.348
Yes.Okay.

18:52.522 --> 18:54.437
So then we'll go back
to Task Champ

18:54.611 --> 18:56.700
first thing and then, you know,

18:56.874 --> 18:58.528
we all have to go there in
the mornings to pick up product,

18:58.702 --> 18:59.921
so then we'll follow him
until he gets to Paula's.

19:00.095 --> 19:02.010
Yeah, that could take all day.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.881
I could be there right now,
Darnell.

19:04.055 --> 19:06.101
You mentioned that!

19:06.232 --> 19:07.885
All right?

19:08.059 --> 19:08.799
I'm sorry. I said I was sorry.

19:08.973 --> 19:10.105
I don't accept your apology.

19:10.236 --> 19:11.411
I don't accept
your apology.

19:11.585 --> 19:13.326
I don't accept your apology.

19:22.073 --> 19:23.597
That's him. That's him.

19:23.771 --> 19:25.381
That's the dealer.
Hello.

19:30.995 --> 19:32.606
You guys got a leaky faucet?

19:32.780 --> 19:34.738
Where's your,
where's your place?
