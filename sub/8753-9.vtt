WEBVTT

00:10.450 --> 00:12.384
That's not good.

00:12.386 --> 00:14.853
Something's attacking her.

00:14.855 --> 00:17.056
Everybody's hearing voices.

00:17.058 --> 00:19.491
Some living people have disappeared.

00:20.193 --> 00:22.361
This is the victim that he murdered.

00:22.363 --> 00:23.996
I'm real sick in this room.

00:23.998 --> 00:26.332
It's, like, trying to bite
my chest and my throat.

00:27.467 --> 00:29.134
It definitely creeped me out.

00:29.136 --> 00:32.237
The dead can go into the house.

00:33.423 --> 00:37.042
I think that some of
them could be dangerous.

00:37.978 --> 00:39.845
"You're mine. You can't escape."

00:39.847 --> 00:42.948
My name is Amy Allan.

00:42.950 --> 00:44.616
What's happening?

00:44.618 --> 00:46.986
I see dead people.

00:46.988 --> 00:48.687
It seems like a devil.

00:48.689 --> 00:50.289
I speak to dead people.

00:50.291 --> 00:52.224
He's pissed off.

00:52.226 --> 00:53.392
And they speak to me.

00:53.394 --> 00:55.527
I felt real fear.

00:55.529 --> 00:58.530
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:58.532 --> 01:00.499
I think she's being murdered.

01:00.501 --> 01:02.101
I rely on my partner.

01:02.103 --> 01:03.369
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:03.371 --> 01:05.370
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:05.373 --> 01:07.473
Serial killer pops in my head.

01:07.475 --> 01:10.676
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:10.678 --> 01:11.910
Nobody believes me.

01:11.912 --> 01:13.345
It's my job to reveal them.

01:13.347 --> 01:15.614
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

01:15.616 --> 01:17.349
But Steve and I never speak...

01:17.351 --> 01:19.385
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:19.387 --> 01:20.586
...until the very end.

01:20.588 --> 01:22.354
You got problems. I got news for you.

01:22.356 --> 01:24.556
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:24.558 --> 01:26.625
This is our house...
whether they like it or not.

01:26.627 --> 01:28.277
Or time to get out.

01:28.279 --> 01:30.963
This is their house, the house of the dead.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074

01:47.714 --> 01:49.148
I'm in Roseburg, Oregon.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.350
It's about an hour south of Eugene.

01:51.352 --> 01:54.119
I received a call from a woman named Lori.

01:54.121 --> 01:57.356
Now, she takes care of
elderly people in her home.

01:57.358 --> 02:00.793
She says the activity is
putting her patients at risk

02:00.795 --> 02:03.095
and destroying her personal life.

02:04.814 --> 02:06.965
She sounded really bad,
and I'm hoping we can help her out.

02:12.772 --> 02:14.773
Before Amy arrives,

02:14.775 --> 02:17.476
I sweep the house, removing artwork,

02:17.478 --> 02:20.479
family photos, and personal items

02:20.481 --> 02:22.681
to avoid influencing her findings.

02:22.683 --> 02:23.916
When I'm finished,

02:23.918 --> 02:26.051
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

02:39.966 --> 02:42.734
Oh, boy. That's not good.

02:42.736 --> 02:45.137
You know, there's a doorway there.

02:47.991 --> 02:55.881
It's pretty long,
and it does kind of go pretty far that way.

03:01.154 --> 03:05.157
There are things,

03:05.159 --> 03:10.462
and there's also some kind of path.

03:10.464 --> 03:15.934
Now, this is separate from this doorway.

03:18.605 --> 03:22.074
There are dead people on it, walking.

03:22.076 --> 03:26.345
I'm very concerned about the living people

03:26.347 --> 03:29.114
wandering up in there and disappearing.

03:29.116 --> 03:31.383
Like, where are they disappearing to?

03:33.319 --> 03:34.686
Other dimensions.

03:42.111 --> 03:43.562
Lori, I'm glad I'm here.

03:43.564 --> 03:45.814
You sounded really upset
and desperate on the phone.

03:45.816 --> 03:47.199
So, what's exactly going on?

03:47.201 --> 03:49.234
It's really been tough here.

03:49.236 --> 03:51.103
Um, in the last three years,

03:51.105 --> 03:53.372
things have just gotten to the point

03:53.374 --> 03:55.841
to where I'm scared to be here.

03:55.843 --> 03:57.609
Now, who exactly lives in the house?

03:57.611 --> 04:01.063
Me, my boyfriend, Devin,
his little girl, Cameron.

04:01.065 --> 04:04.049
I have a picture of her here.
This is Cameron.

04:04.051 --> 04:08.554
And I have an adult foster care that we run,

04:08.556 --> 04:11.990
and so there's three ladies
that live also in the home.

04:11.992 --> 04:13.325
So, they're here all the time?

04:13.327 --> 04:14.359
All the time.

04:14.361 --> 04:15.460
So, these people are, basically,

04:15.462 --> 04:16.862
part of your family when you think about it?

04:16.863 --> 04:17.880
Yes. They are.

04:17.882 --> 04:20.866
I also have a caregiver who lives here

04:20.868 --> 04:22.501
by the name of Julie.

04:22.503 --> 04:23.819
Are they experiencing anything?

04:23.821 --> 04:27.472
Yes, they're afraid to
even go to bed at night.

04:27.474 --> 04:29.174
Everybody's hearing voices,

04:29.176 --> 04:33.345
items moving on their own, apparitions.

04:33.347 --> 04:35.597
Our health is declining here,

04:35.599 --> 04:37.549
and our mood swings are elevated.

04:39.269 --> 04:42.120
Now, how long have you been living here?

04:42.122 --> 04:43.238
I grew up here.

04:43.240 --> 04:46.842
I moved away when I turned 18,

04:46.844 --> 04:50.846
and I moved back here about seven,
eight years now.

04:50.848 --> 04:52.764
You know any history about the house?

04:52.766 --> 04:54.766
Not really, I just know that the house

04:54.768 --> 04:58.637
was originally about a mile north from here.

04:58.639 --> 05:00.038
And here's a picture of the house

05:00.040 --> 05:02.608
when it was first moved here.

05:02.610 --> 05:06.011
So, the house has been moved? Yeah.

05:06.013 --> 05:07.679
Do you have any idea why it was moved?

05:07.681 --> 05:08.997
They had to move the house

05:08.999 --> 05:11.116
to make way for the interstate freeway.

05:11.118 --> 05:12.451
Okay. Now, do you know

05:12.453 --> 05:14.670
if this is still on the original property?

05:14.672 --> 05:16.054
Yeah, it is.

05:16.056 --> 05:17.990
Okay, that's interesting.

05:17.992 --> 05:20.826
Have you done anything in the house

05:20.828 --> 05:22.628
to try to fix what's happening here?

05:22.630 --> 05:26.415
I tried to sage it a couple times,
doing a blessing.

05:26.417 --> 05:27.466
Okay.

05:27.468 --> 05:29.534
And that didn't really work.

05:29.536 --> 05:31.303
What do you hope we can do for you?

05:31.305 --> 05:33.705
The home, it means a lot to me.

05:33.707 --> 05:36.275
I pray and I hope that you and Amy

05:36.277 --> 05:39.378
can help us with what's going on here

05:39.380 --> 05:41.847
so we can continue our business
and continue living here.

05:45.385 --> 05:48.153
There's a barrier.

05:48.155 --> 05:54.126
Someone's put up, uh,
protections around the property,

05:54.128 --> 05:58.930
but, uh, things are getting in.

05:58.932 --> 06:02.301
Because of the pathway and
the doorway in the woods,

06:02.303 --> 06:04.569
the activity here is out of control.

06:04.571 --> 06:06.705
Dead people and strange creatures

06:06.707 --> 06:08.340
are walking in and out of this home.

06:08.342 --> 06:11.877
So, I do think that they've
heard scratching on the walls,

06:11.879 --> 06:14.980
people walking around.

06:14.982 --> 06:17.349
Yeah, they've seen some weird [bleep]

06:22.989 --> 06:24.923
Okay. What's going on in here?

06:24.925 --> 06:26.625
This is where the business

06:26.627 --> 06:28.593
and my resident and my caregiver live.

06:28.595 --> 06:31.246
Okay. And this was here when
you lived here as a kid?

06:31.248 --> 06:33.332
Yes, my bedroom's right
over here when I grew up.

06:33.334 --> 06:34.599
Let me ask you a question.

06:34.601 --> 06:37.469
Back then, were you having any experiences?

06:37.471 --> 06:38.804
We had a few experiences.

06:38.806 --> 06:44.009
My grandmother would see faces
or people looking in at her

06:44.011 --> 06:46.011
through the windows and her door.

06:46.013 --> 06:47.846
Just faces, though. Not a body.

06:49.482 --> 06:51.316
How was her mind at the time?

06:51.318 --> 06:52.551
She was fine.

06:52.553 --> 06:54.119
All right. What else is going on down here?

06:54.121 --> 06:55.854
Well, down here we hear,

06:55.856 --> 06:58.990
like, footsteps upstairs when nobody's home,

06:58.992 --> 07:00.976
voices, like, people talking,

07:00.978 --> 07:03.962
conversations of people that aren't there.

07:03.964 --> 07:06.198
Between how many people, you think?

07:06.200 --> 07:07.783
- Two, three.
- All right.

07:07.785 --> 07:09.601
I mean, TVs left on upstairs,
anything like that?

07:09.603 --> 07:14.523
No, and we have banging
sounds throughout the house.

07:14.525 --> 07:18.377
And it sounds like someone's picking up,
like, encyclopedias

07:18.379 --> 07:21.313
and just dropping 'em, books just booms.

07:21.315 --> 07:23.014
It's really crazy.

07:23.016 --> 07:24.816
I mean, that's got to scare
the hell out of you.

07:24.818 --> 07:26.017
Yeah, it does.

07:28.087 --> 07:32.257
I'm seeing a creature thing, big and dark.

07:32.259 --> 07:38.597
Looks like an animal,
scratching on the outside walls.

07:38.599 --> 07:42.300
It's not very intelligent.

07:42.302 --> 07:45.637
Uh... it's more like a moth.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.322
Do you know where it comes from?

07:47.324 --> 07:49.508
From that, uh, hallway.

07:49.510 --> 07:52.327
Are the other things that
come out of this hallway,

07:52.329 --> 07:53.612
are they like this one?

07:53.614 --> 07:57.249
Uh, they're all different entities.

07:57.251 --> 08:00.819
I think that some of
them could be dangerous.

08:05.658 --> 08:07.492
What's going on in here?

08:07.494 --> 08:09.795
It's almost like a struggle every day

08:09.797 --> 08:11.263
just to be yourself here.

08:11.265 --> 08:13.899
I think all of us happen
to have mood swings.

08:13.901 --> 08:16.535
Devin and I,
we're having a really tough time.

08:16.537 --> 08:19.271
It's just this rage that gets into you.

08:19.273 --> 08:21.923
The easiest and simplest little thing

08:21.925 --> 08:24.726
just flares him off or flares me off.

08:24.728 --> 08:27.479
Now, these mood swings,
is it affecting your relationship?

08:27.481 --> 08:30.115
Yes, our relationship's about done.

08:30.117 --> 08:34.686
If we can't figure this out,
I think we're splitting up.

08:34.688 --> 08:36.388
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:36.390 --> 08:39.191
I mean, couples go through
that all the time.

08:39.193 --> 08:40.826
- You sure it's paranormal?
- Yeah.

08:40.828 --> 08:43.260
Since the activity has picked up,

08:43.263 --> 08:45.397
we're not the same people.

08:45.399 --> 08:46.631
Do you feel any better when you're away?

08:46.633 --> 08:48.800
Yeah, I feel a lot better.

08:48.802 --> 08:51.102
We don't fight, we don't argue,

08:51.104 --> 08:53.638
we don't go into these weird rages.

08:53.640 --> 08:55.423
Now, is anything else going on?

08:55.425 --> 08:57.042
We're all getting very ill.

08:57.044 --> 08:59.344
I'm just fatigued in this home,

08:59.346 --> 09:04.416
and I've been diagnosed with fibromyalgia,
lots of pain.

09:04.418 --> 09:06.685
When you leave here, do you feel any better?

09:06.687 --> 09:09.087
Yeah, I have a lot more energy.

09:09.089 --> 09:11.556
I'm begging you guys to help me.

09:11.558 --> 09:12.707
All right.

09:12.709 --> 09:13.959
Hopefully you called us in,
in time, you know,

09:13.961 --> 09:15.160
and we can get this fixed.

09:15.162 --> 09:16.795
I hope so.

09:24.370 --> 09:26.972
I'm seeing a living woman in here.

09:29.675 --> 09:31.476
I think they are a sensitive.

09:31.478 --> 09:32.911
I think they know it.

09:32.913 --> 09:36.414
I think it's something
that is in their family.

09:42.371 --> 09:47.125
If there's random dead
people that run through,

09:47.127 --> 09:51.997
a person could pick up on that
and the feelings from that.

09:51.999 --> 09:54.266
Being a sensitive in a highly active area

09:54.268 --> 09:56.535
over time can make you sick.

09:56.537 --> 09:57.836
Sick how?

09:57.838 --> 10:00.839
Anything from flu-like symptoms to cancer.

10:26.855 --> 10:28.423
So, Devin, I was talking to Lori

10:28.425 --> 10:29.557
and she says you live here with her.

10:29.559 --> 10:30.592
Yes, correct.

10:30.594 --> 10:33.161
She also explained how both of you

10:33.163 --> 10:35.597
have mood swings that are
causing a lot of tension.

10:35.599 --> 10:36.731
We can just be getting along just fine,

10:36.733 --> 10:37.932
and all of a sudden,

10:37.934 --> 10:39.667
just be angry with each other for no reason.

10:39.669 --> 10:41.402
But what makes you think it's paranormal,
though?

10:41.404 --> 10:42.320
I mean, couples fight.

10:42.322 --> 10:44.272
Because of the way it escalates,

10:44.274 --> 10:45.607
and the feelings that I get.

10:45.609 --> 10:48.126
You know, it has a lot to do with the house.

10:48.128 --> 10:50.745
I've sat down and had
conversations with Lori

10:50.747 --> 10:52.747
about maybe it's the entity here.

10:52.749 --> 10:55.950
I can feel the vibes coming off of it.

10:55.952 --> 10:58.886
It's definitely gonna
get enjoyment out of...

10:58.888 --> 11:00.688
of wrecking a relationship.

11:00.690 --> 11:03.257
Have you had any experiences here?

11:03.259 --> 11:05.994
Uh, just the cupboards being opened.

11:05.996 --> 11:07.395
Lots of cupboards.

11:07.397 --> 11:09.130
I'm thinking, you know,

11:09.132 --> 11:12.166
Lori leaving the cupboards
again and it's not.

11:12.168 --> 11:14.986
And do they lock in, or are they loose?

11:14.988 --> 11:16.337
They do catch.

11:16.339 --> 11:18.039
Do you hear it,
or you just go in there and you see it?

11:18.041 --> 11:19.674
Just go in and see it.

11:19.676 --> 11:21.876
Just after I just closed 'em.

11:21.878 --> 11:25.146
- Anything else?
- Yes.

11:25.148 --> 11:26.848
My daughter, she got pushed.

11:26.850 --> 11:28.416
- She got pushed.
- Mm-hmm.

11:28.418 --> 11:31.185
She was outside on the steps,
out there by the fish pond

11:31.187 --> 11:33.388
- before the fish pond was put in.
- Okay.

11:33.390 --> 11:36.257
And I was sitting inside the house,
and she ran in,

11:36.259 --> 11:37.992
just screaming in hysterics.

11:37.994 --> 11:39.577
And she's sure it wasn't one of the animals

11:39.579 --> 11:41.429
- bumping into her or anything like that?
- No, no.

11:41.431 --> 11:43.564
I know she's very well
stressed out about it.

11:43.566 --> 11:45.466
She's very scared.

11:45.468 --> 11:48.569
It's not fair. It's not fair to anybody.

11:54.143 --> 11:57.078
There's someone with long brown hair.

11:57.080 --> 11:58.513
I think it's a girl.

11:58.515 --> 12:00.948
Something's happening to her.

12:00.950 --> 12:03.785
Something's, like, attacking her.

12:05.387 --> 12:07.005
Her arms, she can't lift them

12:07.007 --> 12:09.057
because they are being held down.

12:16.799 --> 12:18.933
I don't know what that was.

12:24.540 --> 12:28.276
There was this weird
person that ran out of here

12:28.278 --> 12:32.980
and then jumped out at me, growled,

12:32.982 --> 12:35.850
and was, like,
trying to bite my chest and my throat.

12:35.852 --> 12:39.654
They just ran... ran away,
and it was, like, out of nowhere.

12:39.656 --> 12:42.890
It definitely creeped me out, though.

12:47.846 --> 12:49.697
I've seen an apparition.

12:49.699 --> 12:51.299
- Of what?
- Of a lady.

12:51.301 --> 12:52.934
What kind of clothing we talking about?

12:52.936 --> 12:56.370
Talking about the old... old school,
like 18th century.

12:56.372 --> 12:58.039
You know, those old shirts
that used to balloon out?

12:58.041 --> 12:59.474
- Puff... puff out, yeah.
- Puff out.

12:59.476 --> 13:01.459
- That's what she was wearing.
- Okay.

13:01.461 --> 13:03.928
Now, if you had to guess
on an age of this person,

13:03.930 --> 13:05.012
what would you think?

13:05.014 --> 13:08.282
Probably 30s, 40s, something like that.

13:08.284 --> 13:10.017
Okay. So, not... not a young teenage girl.

13:10.019 --> 13:11.452
Were you drinking the night before?

13:11.454 --> 13:12.336
- Where you woke up a little hammered?
- No, no.

13:12.338 --> 13:13.755
- Nothing like that?
- No.

13:13.757 --> 13:16.691
Definitely more than one
entity that comes through here,

13:16.693 --> 13:17.959
and it just seems like

13:17.961 --> 13:20.495
spirits are trying to get to the other side,

13:20.497 --> 13:22.313
and this is a go-through.

13:22.315 --> 13:23.981
Okay.

13:30.773 --> 13:35.510
I think most of the activity
is coming from outside.

13:37.246 --> 13:40.381
It's very unsettled.

13:40.383 --> 13:43.151
There's a lot of traffic.

13:43.153 --> 13:46.954
Dead traffic.

13:46.956 --> 13:50.258
The house isn't in a good place.

13:54.630 --> 13:58.349
The first hallway is here,

13:58.351 --> 14:02.336
and mostly what I'm seeing
coming out of this end

14:02.338 --> 14:05.840
are more creature-like things.

14:05.842 --> 14:08.976
Things I don't know what they are.

14:08.978 --> 14:12.613
Next to it is a path

14:12.615 --> 14:16.450
that a lot of the dead people are on.

14:16.452 --> 14:21.088
Sometimes,
the ones that are consciously dead

14:21.090 --> 14:27.695
will... will wander off the
path and can go into the house.

14:36.471 --> 14:38.372
Julie, I was talking to Lori

14:38.374 --> 14:40.308
and she says you work and live here.

14:40.310 --> 14:41.342
Correct.

14:41.344 --> 14:42.643
Okay. How long has that been going on?

14:42.645 --> 14:44.295
I've worked here a little over two years

14:44.297 --> 14:45.746
and lived here about eight months.

14:45.748 --> 14:47.448
Now, you've had experiences here?

14:47.450 --> 14:48.583
Yes, I have.

14:48.585 --> 14:51.319
The first one being a human bite mark

14:51.321 --> 14:52.787
right here on my arm.

14:52.789 --> 14:54.889
I woke up with it.

14:54.891 --> 14:56.207
Okay. Was it, like, red?

14:56.209 --> 14:57.558
Oh, yeah.

14:57.560 --> 15:01.495
Just like little,
tiny... like a human bite mark.

15:01.497 --> 15:02.864
Why did I get a bite mark?

15:02.866 --> 15:04.599
You know, I don't... I don't know.

15:04.601 --> 15:06.467
Why me?

15:06.469 --> 15:09.237
I can see it upsets you,
just thinking about it.

15:09.239 --> 15:11.472
It does.

15:11.474 --> 15:13.958
You know, I'm not gonna leave, though.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.943
I mean, I'm just... I won't.

15:15.945 --> 15:17.545
Well, you take care of these people

15:17.547 --> 15:18.713
like you're family to them.

15:18.715 --> 15:22.450
They are my family.

15:22.452 --> 15:24.986
Now, let me ask you a question, Julie.

15:24.988 --> 15:27.455
Is there any place in the
house or anywhere at all

15:27.457 --> 15:28.606
that you don't like at all?

15:28.608 --> 15:30.691
Yes, the wooded area outside.

15:30.693 --> 15:32.460
On two different occasions,

15:32.462 --> 15:35.796
I've seen a light flicker
and it was black outside.

15:35.798 --> 15:37.048
Totally dark, no lights.

15:37.050 --> 15:38.816
I can imagine it gets dark here.

15:38.818 --> 15:40.034
It does get very dark,

15:40.036 --> 15:44.171
and this was very clear that it was a light.

15:44.173 --> 15:45.990
I don't have a reason for it.

15:45.992 --> 15:50.144
It's like someone stood out
there and lit a lighter.

15:50.146 --> 15:53.414
It scares me, and I come in, you know?

15:53.416 --> 15:55.783
But you did check the first time you saw it?

15:55.785 --> 15:57.852
I did, and the next morning I went out

15:57.854 --> 15:59.553
and looked to see if possibly

15:59.555 --> 16:01.589
there was a cigarette butt, you know?

16:01.591 --> 16:02.590
- Right.
- There was nothing.

16:08.864 --> 16:15.336
There's this path next
to this hallway thing.

16:15.338 --> 16:18.773
It goes this way, too, pretty far.

16:18.775 --> 16:25.513
Also, I think that, you know,
sometimes, over the years,

16:25.515 --> 16:30.318
some living people have gone
into this and have disappeared.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.386
Somebody could just walk

16:32.388 --> 16:34.755
into this hallway thing and disappear?

16:34.757 --> 16:36.791
I do think so, yes.

16:36.793 --> 16:37.858
So, where does it go?

16:37.860 --> 16:39.994
I'd say other dimensions.

16:39.996 --> 16:41.279
Where do those go?

16:41.281 --> 16:42.280
I... I don't know.

16:42.282 --> 16:43.764
I don't want to know.

16:59.075 --> 17:00.609
I went through the property deeds

17:00.611 --> 17:02.327
and nothing really jumped out at me,

17:02.329 --> 17:03.445
but when I got in touch

17:03.447 --> 17:05.247
with a local historian and author,

17:05.249 --> 17:07.115
she said the story of the first owner

17:07.117 --> 17:09.034
of Lori's property might help my case.

17:15.590 --> 17:17.425
Well, Diane,
thanks for taking the time to meet me.

17:17.426 --> 17:18.760
I appreciate that.

17:18.762 --> 17:20.679
So, who exactly was the
first owner of the property

17:20.681 --> 17:21.896
I'm investigating?

17:21.898 --> 17:25.767
Rufus Beamon was the first
owner of the property.

17:25.769 --> 17:28.136
This is a picture of him.

17:32.208 --> 17:35.644
This is the documents showing his ownership

17:35.646 --> 17:38.763
of 320 acres in... in the area of Roseburg.

17:38.765 --> 17:41.183
Gosh, that's a lot of property.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.350
That was standard.

17:42.352 --> 17:45.387
And if you were married, you got 640 acres.

17:45.389 --> 17:46.488
Wow.

17:53.462 --> 17:56.164
Uh, there's somebody on the floor.

17:56.166 --> 18:00.335
Why is this person on the floor?

18:00.337 --> 18:02.721
It's like something
paranormal happened to him,

18:02.723 --> 18:04.406
and he fell down because of it.

18:13.583 --> 18:17.886
So, that's where he went.

18:17.888 --> 18:22.591
He just wants to show me things
that happened to him here.

18:22.593 --> 18:27.495
He was haunted here.

18:27.497 --> 18:34.302
What I saw so far was him being
in a chair and freaking out.

18:34.304 --> 18:36.905
I don't know if he built this place

18:36.907 --> 18:39.407
or if he's the first owner of it,

18:39.409 --> 18:43.311
but he feels like that to me.

18:46.515 --> 18:49.251
Now, Diane,
you mentioned that this guy, Beamon,

18:49.253 --> 18:51.219
had an interesting story that may help
my case. What did you mean by that?

18:51.221 --> 18:54.456
He participated in the
Rogue River Indian Wars.

18:54.458 --> 18:55.523
What happened?

18:55.525 --> 18:57.792
Settlers wanted the land,

18:57.794 --> 19:00.762
and the Native Americans, of course,

19:00.764 --> 19:04.115
were being shoved off their
land and kind of fought back.

19:04.117 --> 19:05.233
Okay.

19:05.235 --> 19:07.902
The battle he was involved in,

19:07.904 --> 19:10.138
called the Battle of Hungry Hill,

19:10.140 --> 19:13.875
took place on October 31, 1855.

19:13.877 --> 19:15.644
Where exactly was this battle set?

19:15.646 --> 19:17.112
Just out of Roseburg.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.680
Okay.

19:18.682 --> 19:20.799
A group of the Native Americans

19:20.801 --> 19:22.784
had gone into the hills to hide.

19:22.786 --> 19:26.388
One of the Native Americans situated himself

19:26.390 --> 19:28.356
so that he was a sniper,

19:28.358 --> 19:32.594
and he started shooting the men
that were coming up the hill.

19:32.596 --> 19:34.796
So now, how bloody did this battle get?

19:34.798 --> 19:37.782
And the settlers and the militia

19:37.784 --> 19:39.484
lost about 39 men.

19:39.486 --> 19:42.604
The Native Americans probably
had 15 to 16 casualties.

19:42.606 --> 19:46.424
This is the only battle that
the Native Americans won.

19:46.426 --> 19:49.644
So now, did Beamon come out of this okay?

19:49.646 --> 19:50.679
Yes, he did.

19:50.681 --> 19:53.581
He returned home to his property,

19:53.583 --> 19:56.418
and he lived on the land
for a few more years

19:56.420 --> 19:57.702
before he sold it,

19:57.704 --> 20:00.722
and then he moved up to Washington in 1861.

20:00.724 --> 20:02.557
So, what happens to the Native Americans?

20:02.559 --> 20:07.195
In April of 1856, they were all rounded up

20:07.197 --> 20:10.732
and sent to reservations
up in Northern Oregon.

20:10.734 --> 20:12.534
Okay. Did they ever come back here?

20:12.536 --> 20:15.904
No, they never regained
their original lands.

20:15.906 --> 20:18.907
Just recently, some archaeologists found

20:18.909 --> 20:22.010
the original battle site and excavated it.

20:24.613 --> 20:27.349
The man downstairs thinks

20:27.351 --> 20:33.488
that it's all Native American curse stuff

20:33.490 --> 20:38.426
because he says that up the hill there,

20:38.428 --> 20:41.830
somebody did something bad to
their Native American stuff.

20:43.816 --> 20:48.603
He says that they were doing some...
some excavating.

20:48.605 --> 20:54.709
They were digging stuff up,
and that's what he thinks happened.

21:05.554 --> 21:07.922
I'm real sick in this room.

21:10.459 --> 21:11.626
Really, really sick.

21:11.628 --> 21:14.329
Do you know if there's
something causing this?

21:14.331 --> 21:17.265
Think that some of the physical ailments

21:17.267 --> 21:20.835
is due to some of the activity here.

21:23.038 --> 21:24.672
Real bad, real bad.

21:28.544 --> 21:31.045
Really bad. Oh.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.067
So far, I've got clients

21:47.069 --> 21:49.003
being terrorized by unexplained activity

21:49.005 --> 21:51.205
and a property that's
been the site of bloodshed

21:51.207 --> 21:53.474
between Native Americans and white settlers.

21:53.476 --> 21:55.676
But I need to see if there's anything else.

21:57.379 --> 21:58.812
Searching through old records,

21:58.814 --> 22:00.781
I found a man named Richard Brumfield,

22:00.783 --> 22:03.017
who committed a brutal murder in 1921.

22:03.019 --> 22:05.219
Turns out, he has a direct connection

22:05.221 --> 22:06.520
to my client's property.

22:08.673 --> 22:10.441
As soon as I found out a murder victim

22:10.443 --> 22:11.742
was dumped on Lori's property,

22:11.744 --> 22:13.727
first call I made was to the local sheriff.

22:13.729 --> 22:16.463
He said it was one of
the most horrific murders

22:16.465 --> 22:17.898
in Roseburg's history.

22:26.441 --> 22:30.511
So, the articles I came across
show that a body was dumped

22:30.513 --> 22:32.580
on what was once my client's property,

22:32.582 --> 22:35.232
and it was a sensational case.

22:35.234 --> 22:37.918
What do you know about the guy,
Brumfield himself?

22:37.920 --> 22:39.253
Well, I know Brumfield

22:39.255 --> 22:42.373
was a very influential
professional here in Roseburg.

22:42.375 --> 22:45.125
He was a dentist that
moved here in about 1909

22:45.127 --> 22:47.394
and was popular in all the social circles

22:47.396 --> 22:49.496
here in Roseburg at the time, as well.

22:49.498 --> 22:51.632
Okay. So, what do you know
about the case itself?

22:51.634 --> 22:53.267
Well, let me show you something.

22:59.074 --> 23:02.076
So, this picture here is of Dr. Brumfield,

23:02.078 --> 23:05.379
the dentist and suspect
in this homicide case.

23:05.381 --> 23:08.716
This picture here,
this is of the victim that he murdered.

23:08.718 --> 23:11.051
- That's William Russell.
- Now, who was he?

23:11.053 --> 23:12.753
Well, William Russell
worked on a local farm.

23:12.755 --> 23:14.054
Okay.

23:14.056 --> 23:17.875
The doctor was looking for
someone that he could kill

23:17.877 --> 23:21.579
and use the body to fake his own death.

23:21.581 --> 23:24.698
So, he murders this guy to
make it look like it's him?

23:24.700 --> 23:26.000
That's correct.

23:26.002 --> 23:27.301
What's the motive to kill this guy, then?

23:27.303 --> 23:29.570
Well, Brumfield wanted to start a new life

23:29.572 --> 23:31.338
with his mistress up in Canada.

23:31.340 --> 23:32.940
How's he wind up murdering him

23:32.942 --> 23:35.242
and trying to make it
look like his own body?

23:35.244 --> 23:38.812
He ends up drinking with Mr. Russell,

23:38.814 --> 23:40.197
feeds him some Strychnine.

23:40.199 --> 23:41.482
That doesn't kill him.

23:41.484 --> 23:44.218
He ends up having to finish
the job with a rifle,

23:44.220 --> 23:45.586
and he shoots him twice.

23:45.588 --> 23:48.689
He places his body in his vehicle here.

23:48.691 --> 23:51.675
Dr. Brumfield placed him in that car,

23:51.677 --> 23:53.994
he took his own ring off of his finger

23:53.996 --> 23:56.163
and placed it on the victim's hand.

23:56.165 --> 23:57.564
Okay.

23:57.566 --> 24:00.634
He actually removes the victim's dentures,
or his teeth,

24:00.636 --> 24:04.004
and placed a stick of dynamite
in the mouth of the victim,

24:04.006 --> 24:08.275
which ultimately exploded
and decapitated the body.

24:08.277 --> 24:10.511
Then the car was doused with
gasoline and lit on fire

24:10.513 --> 24:11.578
and pushed off the road.

24:11.580 --> 24:13.914
Okay, so that's how this car winds up

24:13.916 --> 24:16.083
in my client's property at that time.

24:16.085 --> 24:17.284
That's correct.

24:17.286 --> 24:19.970
This is the death certificate
for William Russell.

24:19.972 --> 24:22.856
So, how did the cops wind up figuring out

24:22.858 --> 24:24.508
that it wasn't Brumfield in the car?

24:24.510 --> 24:27.928
Well, during the investigation,
the subsequent autopsy,

24:27.930 --> 24:30.230
they found a document on the victim

24:30.232 --> 24:31.932
in the name of Mr. Russell.

24:31.934 --> 24:34.134
I mean,
this guy really thought everything out

24:34.136 --> 24:36.704
except for that one little detail,
as smart as he was.

24:36.706 --> 24:38.972
They always say there's at
least one mistake left behind

24:38.974 --> 24:40.207
in a crime scene.

24:40.209 --> 24:42.493
Did they catch him immediately?
What happens?

24:42.495 --> 24:45.979
They start a search
looking for Dr. Brumfield.

24:45.981 --> 24:47.665
They can't find him locally,

24:47.667 --> 24:50.317
and they end up distributing wanted posters

24:50.319 --> 24:52.519
throughout the Pacific Northwest.

24:52.521 --> 24:54.388
How's he get caught now?

24:54.390 --> 24:57.191
Well, he ends up getting identified

24:57.193 --> 24:59.943
by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

24:59.945 --> 25:01.995
- Up in Canada?
- Up in Canada.

25:01.997 --> 25:02.980
Okay. So, they apprehend him.

25:02.982 --> 25:03.931
They did.

25:03.933 --> 25:06.333
This was a "News-Review" article

25:06.335 --> 25:08.068
when he was caught up in Canada.

25:08.070 --> 25:10.938
- I'm assuming he gets extradited down here.
- He did.

25:10.940 --> 25:12.740
Okay. So, does he go to trial?
What happened?

25:12.742 --> 25:15.726
Went to trial,
he was convicted of first-degree murder

25:15.728 --> 25:18.095
and sentenced to death by hanging.

25:18.097 --> 25:19.680
Okay. So, did they wind up hanging him?

25:19.682 --> 25:21.999
Actually, before he was executed,

25:22.001 --> 25:25.452
he hung himself while we
was in the Oregon State Pen.

25:25.454 --> 25:27.054
Copy of the death certificate

25:27.056 --> 25:29.089
from the Oregon State Penitentiary,

25:29.091 --> 25:32.192
showing that he committed
suicide by hanging.

25:38.400 --> 25:45.873
Someone keeps saying the word "predator"

25:45.875 --> 25:47.975
over and over again.

25:47.977 --> 25:53.414
I felt something bearing down on me,

25:53.416 --> 25:58.402
and feeling like something really large

25:58.404 --> 26:02.790
was behind me,

26:02.792 --> 26:04.858
like, running after me.

26:04.860 --> 26:06.994
Like, down the hill or something.

26:06.996 --> 26:09.263
And then I hear that predator.

26:19.140 --> 26:22.209
I encountered several
entities during my walk,

26:22.211 --> 26:23.944
but two stood out the most.

26:23.946 --> 26:27.548
First, the creature I saw
trying to get into the house.

26:27.550 --> 26:30.517
It was kind of clinging to the house.

26:30.519 --> 26:36.890
It has, like, these really long
limbs that end in these claws.

26:36.892 --> 26:39.610
Did he have, uh,
teeth or fangs, specifically?

26:39.612 --> 26:41.662
Yeah, a lot of fangs.

26:41.664 --> 26:44.565
Next, I described the haunted dead man.

26:44.567 --> 26:51.321
He's about 65, pretty defined square jaw.

26:51.323 --> 26:57.044
His nose was pretty thin,
he had pretty narrow lips.

26:59.113 --> 27:00.481
Is that who you saw?

27:02.450 --> 27:04.485
Yes.

27:25.788 --> 27:28.357
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:28.359 --> 27:30.525
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

27:30.527 --> 27:32.794
and our clients for the first time.

27:32.796 --> 27:35.681
Now, Amy, I don't know
if you picked up on this

27:35.683 --> 27:39.134
during your walk,
but this is both a home and a business.

27:39.136 --> 27:43.455
Now, on this level,
Lori lives here with Devin, her boyfriend,

27:43.457 --> 27:46.308
and his 9-year-old daughter, Cameron.

27:46.310 --> 27:49.211
And downstairs, she has three elderly women

27:49.213 --> 27:52.047
that she takes care of as patients,
full time.

27:52.049 --> 27:53.515
They live here.

27:53.517 --> 27:56.151
And you have a caretaker, Julie,
that lives down there also.

27:56.153 --> 27:58.520
Now, there's a lot of activity here,

27:58.522 --> 28:01.373
and Lori's afraid for
the patients downstairs

28:01.375 --> 28:05.060
and she thinks whatever's here
is ripping her and Devin apart.

28:05.062 --> 28:07.763
So, now that I told Amy a little bit about

28:07.765 --> 28:11.366
what's going on,
I'm gonna have her describe her walk to us.

28:13.603 --> 28:20.575
This is a very active area,
and some of it's pretty unusual.

28:20.577 --> 28:24.312
When I came into the house,

28:24.314 --> 28:28.150
I saw a male laying on the floor,

28:28.152 --> 28:29.684
apparently dead.

28:29.686 --> 28:34.156
He was being tormented by something,

28:34.158 --> 28:38.744
and I thought that he had built this place

28:38.746 --> 28:42.731
or was the first owner of the home.

28:42.733 --> 28:46.084
He was convinced that he
had all of these problems

28:46.086 --> 28:49.504
because he thinks there's
a Native American curse,

28:49.506 --> 28:52.407
and he was talking about

28:52.409 --> 28:55.877
how something bad happened to them.

28:55.879 --> 28:59.581
But he kept going on and
on about archaeologists

28:59.583 --> 29:03.385
or, like, students or something,
digging up stuff,

29:03.387 --> 29:08.356
and that that's what caused the problems.

29:08.358 --> 29:10.492
Well, it makes sense to me a little bit.

29:10.494 --> 29:12.811
I don't know if it's
gonna make sense to Amy,

29:12.813 --> 29:14.896
because the original owner of your land

29:14.898 --> 29:16.364
was a man named Rufus Beamon.

29:16.366 --> 29:21.403
Now, Beamon was granted
320 acres back in 1850.

29:21.405 --> 29:24.990
And your house is right in the
middle of his original property.

29:24.992 --> 29:27.492
Now, when you talk about
the Native American curse,

29:27.494 --> 29:30.078
in the 1850s,
there was the Rogue River Indian Wars.

29:30.080 --> 29:32.614
Beamon was involved in the only battle

29:32.616 --> 29:34.549
that white settlers were involved in

29:34.551 --> 29:37.252
with the Native Americans
that the white settlers lost.

29:37.254 --> 29:39.321
The Americans had 39 casualties,

29:39.323 --> 29:42.724
and I think the Native
Americans only had 15 losses.

29:42.726 --> 29:45.427
Even though Native
Americans won that battle,

29:45.429 --> 29:47.946
they all got displaced to Northern Oregon

29:47.948 --> 29:49.231
and never came back.

29:49.233 --> 29:51.166
- Now, you mentioned archaeologists.
- Yeah.

29:51.168 --> 29:53.368
They just discovered,
only a couple of years ago,

29:53.370 --> 29:55.237
remnants from that actual war.

29:55.239 --> 29:56.404
Wow.

29:56.406 --> 29:59.474
So, Amy, do you think
this is the guy you saw?

30:01.377 --> 30:04.412
I did do a sketch of the person that I saw,

30:04.414 --> 30:06.481
but he looked much older.

30:13.606 --> 30:15.223
You guys take a look. You tell me.

30:16.526 --> 30:17.792
Wow.

30:20.229 --> 30:24.366
Look at the nose.
His hair's even parted right.

30:25.735 --> 30:27.419
I've seen thousands
and thousands of sketches

30:27.421 --> 30:28.703
during my time.

30:28.705 --> 30:35.110
Between the eyes, the nose...
pretty damn close.

30:35.112 --> 30:36.344
Now, do you think Beamon's your guy?

30:36.346 --> 30:38.480
Very possible.

30:42.552 --> 30:45.053
How did the rest of your walk go?

30:45.055 --> 30:47.889
So, when I got here, I saw

30:47.891 --> 30:51.560
that there had been a barrier
put up around the house,

30:51.562 --> 30:54.362
which was actually a smart thing to do

30:54.364 --> 30:56.932
because there is so much activity.

30:58.651 --> 31:01.002
We have saged here before.

31:01.004 --> 31:03.054
Have you done the outside of the house?

31:03.056 --> 31:04.773
- Everywhere.
- Okay.

31:04.775 --> 31:08.543
When I was walking around,
I went into the master bedroom.

31:08.545 --> 31:11.429
And that's where I got a couple of things.

31:11.431 --> 31:14.232
One was that you probably have abilities,

31:14.234 --> 31:17.269
and that you may know it.

31:17.271 --> 31:19.271
That it runs in your family.

31:19.273 --> 31:22.307
And what happens is that

31:22.309 --> 31:26.094
some of the dead that wander
about here will come in,

31:26.096 --> 31:29.531
and they're curious about you.

31:29.533 --> 31:32.651
And you don't know, inherently,
how to move them on

31:32.653 --> 31:34.369
because you're not a medium.

31:34.371 --> 31:36.538
You're a psychic.

31:38.407 --> 31:40.575
Now, did you have any idea
you might be a psychic?

31:40.577 --> 31:41.710
Yeah, yeah.

31:41.712 --> 31:43.812
You didn't tell me that, did you?

31:43.814 --> 31:44.813
I don't tell anybody.

31:44.815 --> 31:46.581
Why?

31:46.583 --> 31:49.351
'Cause I don't like it. I shut it down.

31:49.353 --> 31:51.870
You know, some of the things I've seen,

31:51.872 --> 31:53.688
I don't want to see 'em.

31:53.690 --> 31:54.789
What about your family?

31:54.791 --> 31:56.091
Did anybody in your family,

31:56.093 --> 31:58.193
like your grandmother or anything like that?

31:58.195 --> 32:01.096
My mom, my aunts, my great aunt,
all the way down.

32:01.098 --> 32:02.163
Oh, interesting.

32:04.967 --> 32:07.035
So, what else did you see?

32:07.037 --> 32:10.405
Most of the activity that's happening here

32:10.407 --> 32:14.092
is actually coming from two
different places outside.

32:14.094 --> 32:19.981
The first one,
it looks almost like this very long hallway.

32:19.983 --> 32:24.052
And what I saw coming out of it

32:24.054 --> 32:30.025
was these really odd, mutant animals.

32:30.027 --> 32:32.894
One, in particular, jumps on the house.

32:32.896 --> 32:36.748
He would bang on the house,
scratch on the house.

32:36.750 --> 32:38.233
Uh, there was some growling.

32:39.735 --> 32:43.321
And he's been doing this for a very,
very long time,

32:43.323 --> 32:44.939
trying to get in,

32:44.941 --> 32:47.008
but he doesn't have the
wherewithal to get in.

32:47.010 --> 32:48.877
Yeah. You guys were looking at each other

32:48.879 --> 32:50.912
when she was describing,
like, the scratching

32:50.914 --> 32:52.047
and all this other stuff.

32:52.049 --> 32:56.117
Yeah, that's exactly what
we hear all the time.

32:58.654 --> 33:00.188
Why are you shaking, Lori?

33:00.190 --> 33:01.156
It's just overwhelming.

33:01.158 --> 33:03.725
I did do a sketch of him.

33:04.761 --> 33:06.161
- Of the creature?
- Yeah.

33:06.163 --> 33:07.362
Oh, I got to see this.

33:07.364 --> 33:08.530
The one that I saw.

33:15.805 --> 33:17.138
That's the weirdest-looking thing...

33:25.347 --> 33:27.215
What does it want?

33:27.217 --> 33:28.616
He wants in.

33:28.618 --> 33:30.101
Oh.

33:30.103 --> 33:33.021
What would happen if he came in?

33:34.573 --> 33:37.192
Cause problems.

33:37.194 --> 33:39.661
Geez.

33:39.663 --> 33:41.129
So much going on.

33:41.131 --> 33:46.534
I have come out here,
and it'd be at nighttime,

33:46.536 --> 33:48.353
and I can just feel the presence

33:48.355 --> 33:50.672
of whatever at the time it was here.

33:50.674 --> 33:55.643
Creepy, weird things,
like, were in those trees.

33:55.645 --> 33:59.514
That part got me afraid,
and that's where into the lay...

33:59.516 --> 34:02.400
"Lord Jesus Christ,
leave... leave us alone."

34:02.402 --> 34:04.586
- Mm-hmm.
- "Just leave us alone."

34:06.021 --> 34:09.357
Now, you said there were
two things in the woods.

34:09.359 --> 34:11.126
What was the second thing?

34:11.128 --> 34:14.629
The second thing,
which is very near to the hallway,

34:14.630 --> 34:16.947
is actually a path.

34:16.949 --> 34:20.952
And so, there were all these dead people,

34:20.954 --> 34:23.538
you know, on this, going back and forth.

34:23.540 --> 34:26.074
Literally, back and forth on this trail.

34:26.076 --> 34:28.726
It goes right through, right through here.

34:28.728 --> 34:31.813
And occasionally, some of them wander off

34:31.815 --> 34:34.516
and they'll come through the house.

34:34.518 --> 34:39.353
So, due to this... pathway,

34:39.356 --> 34:44.542
there were three things that
I think can bother you guys.

34:44.543 --> 34:47.262
The first thing is illnesses, definitely.

34:47.264 --> 34:52.634
Nausea, flu-like symptoms, headaches.

34:52.636 --> 34:56.036
And as sensitives,
this would be harder on you

34:56.039 --> 35:00.141
than people who are closed.

35:00.143 --> 35:03.394
She just described
everything you're feeling.

35:03.396 --> 35:04.512
You haven't been well, right?

35:04.514 --> 35:05.647
I mean, everybody in this house is sick.

35:05.649 --> 35:09.033
You got diagnosed with fibromyalgia.

35:09.035 --> 35:10.552
Yeah.

35:10.554 --> 35:13.404
But the weird part is when they're not here,
they're okay.

35:13.406 --> 35:17.175
You look like you got a headache now.

35:17.177 --> 35:21.729
I just feel, uh, my energy level

35:21.731 --> 35:25.400
has just totally been sucked dry.

35:25.402 --> 35:27.168
Okay, okay. That kind of makes sense.

35:27.170 --> 35:28.203
All right.

35:28.205 --> 35:30.155
Why?

35:30.157 --> 35:33.908
Because the dead are here,
and it zaps our energy.

35:37.780 --> 35:41.182
And the second thing I was getting was,
like, mood swings.

35:41.184 --> 35:43.618
One of the main reasons we
were called in by in you

35:43.620 --> 35:46.120
was because you guys are
on the verge of breaking up

35:46.122 --> 35:47.555
because of these mood swings.

35:47.557 --> 35:49.791
That's a big factor.

35:49.793 --> 35:52.877
It escalates to where we just
don't talk to each other,

35:52.879 --> 35:55.396
and we're arguing for, like, the next week.

35:55.398 --> 35:57.365
They feed off our negativity.

35:57.367 --> 36:01.336
They want us to fight,
they want us to just destroy...

36:01.338 --> 36:03.037
- Mm-hmm.
- our relationship.

36:03.039 --> 36:06.407
It's not, like, a happy home at all.

36:10.913 --> 36:15.149
The third way the dead can
affect you is very concerning.

36:15.151 --> 36:17.552
Some of them can make physical contact,

36:17.554 --> 36:22.824
and I did see a female asleep,

36:22.826 --> 36:26.527
but there was a dead person
that was actually holding her,

36:26.529 --> 36:28.563
pinning her down to the bed.

36:28.565 --> 36:31.099
It was a pretty violent thing.

36:31.101 --> 36:33.618
And then I actually had
one of the stragglers

36:33.620 --> 36:35.036
jump out at me,

36:35.038 --> 36:37.472
and he just ran right up in my face

36:37.474 --> 36:40.858
and he was, like,
kind of aiming towards my throat

36:40.860 --> 36:43.278
and chest area to, like, bite me.

36:43.280 --> 36:47.665
I'm wondering if that happened
to be what pushed my daughter?

36:47.667 --> 36:50.685
When she was out here at the stairs,
she came running,

36:50.687 --> 36:52.470
"Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!"

36:52.472 --> 36:55.740
She was scared.
She goes, "I just got pushed."

36:55.742 --> 36:56.874
Mm-hmm.

36:56.876 --> 36:58.359
I actually have a picture of his daughter.

36:58.361 --> 37:01.179
Aw.

37:01.181 --> 37:04.465
Now, her caretaker, Julie, got bit.

37:04.467 --> 37:06.801
She's been scratched, bit,

37:06.803 --> 37:10.071
and she said that she feels
that there are spirits here

37:10.073 --> 37:12.607
- is all she told me.
- Okay.

37:12.609 --> 37:15.543
So, the scratching, the biting,
the pushing, and all that.

37:15.545 --> 37:17.045
Is that all the dead people?

37:17.047 --> 37:18.680
That could be, yeah. Mm-hmm.

37:18.682 --> 37:20.315
The dead that are here, I mean,

37:20.317 --> 37:21.449
is it a threat to them?

37:21.451 --> 37:24.919
Yeah. But my biggest concern

37:24.921 --> 37:30.725
is this in-between place, and the fact that

37:30.727 --> 37:36.297
living people can, though rarely,
but they can disappear

37:36.299 --> 37:39.233
into this kind of parallel dimension.

37:39.235 --> 37:41.235
What do you mean by a different dimension?

37:41.237 --> 37:47.408
That these things are coming
from parallel universes.

37:50.579 --> 37:52.847
Can we take a little break?

38:11.728 --> 38:17.300
Living people can, though rarely,
but they can disappear

38:17.302 --> 38:20.603
into this kind of parallel dimension.

38:20.605 --> 38:22.605
What do you mean by a different dimension?

38:22.607 --> 38:28.778
That these things are coming
from parallel universes.

38:31.949 --> 38:34.216
Can we take a little break?

38:39.990 --> 38:41.324
You okay?

38:41.326 --> 38:42.158
Yeah, I'll be all right.

38:42.160 --> 38:43.326
I know this is tough,

38:43.328 --> 38:44.827
especially because you got your daughter.

38:44.829 --> 38:46.095
Mm-hmm.

38:46.097 --> 38:48.731
I'm blessed right now that
she wasn't here for this.

38:51.285 --> 38:53.119
Lori, you remember the first time we spoke

38:53.121 --> 38:54.270
and you said you were scared of this house?

38:54.272 --> 38:55.288
Yes.

38:55.290 --> 38:57.039
Well, you had a very good reason for that.

38:57.041 --> 38:59.542
But we still haven't answered
your biggest question.

38:59.544 --> 39:01.677
Is it safe for you to stay here with Devin,

39:01.679 --> 39:04.080
and your patients that became your family,
really?

39:04.082 --> 39:05.448
So, for that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:07.918 --> 39:12.188
I hate it when this happens,
and it rarely happens.

39:12.190 --> 39:16.025
But in this particular situation,

39:16.027 --> 39:19.795
this home never should've been built.

39:19.797 --> 39:22.732
This area never should've been developed.

39:22.734 --> 39:28.304
There is truly something
supernatural going on

39:28.306 --> 39:33.876
that people, way long ago, before us,

39:33.878 --> 39:37.263
knew and respected and stayed away from.

39:37.265 --> 39:40.516
And, unfortunately, the white man came

39:40.518 --> 39:44.003
and just obliterated those belief systems,

39:44.005 --> 39:48.090
and the people who were
respecting those places,

39:48.092 --> 39:50.593
we didn't listen to them.

39:52.646 --> 39:56.465
With that being said,
I think you should move.

39:59.786 --> 40:02.672
I don't think that anybody should live here.

40:02.674 --> 40:04.974
I don't think it's safe for anyone

40:04.976 --> 40:07.043
with this situation going on.

40:07.045 --> 40:09.178
So, what do we do with the house?

40:09.180 --> 40:11.080
I mean, nobody can live here.

40:11.082 --> 40:12.915
It's a lot to absorb,

40:12.917 --> 40:15.718
because I've got everything
sunk into this house right now.

40:15.720 --> 40:17.586
Sounds like it's just gonna get worse.

40:17.588 --> 40:20.489
If you were to stay, you'd have to sage,

40:20.491 --> 40:21.957
like, twice a day every day

40:21.959 --> 40:23.559
until you got a shaman

40:23.561 --> 40:26.645
who was from this tribe that was displaced.

40:26.647 --> 40:29.215
What that person would be able to do

40:29.217 --> 40:32.368
is create a protective barrier,

40:32.370 --> 40:34.520
but only for the house.

40:34.522 --> 40:38.207
The problem is,
is that you'll be safe in the house.

40:39.543 --> 40:40.976
But you're not safe outside.

40:42.679 --> 40:43.879
You can leave the house,

40:43.881 --> 40:45.648
things aren't gonna follow you in

40:45.650 --> 40:47.049
because you'll have the protective barrier.

40:47.051 --> 40:50.820
But there's things all the time out there

40:50.822 --> 40:53.723
that could potentially harm you.

40:53.725 --> 40:55.758
So, this guy, Beamon, that was the first...

40:55.760 --> 40:57.893
was probably right about
what's going on here.

40:57.895 --> 40:59.428
Yeah, yeah.

40:59.430 --> 41:02.098
You think he brought it on,
or you think he just...

41:02.100 --> 41:05.601
I think he feels guilty.
I think he thinks he did.

41:05.603 --> 41:08.754
You know, I know the money
situation here was not good.

41:08.756 --> 41:12.708
I mean, you sunk everything into this place.

41:12.710 --> 41:13.843
I mean, what are you gonna try to do?

41:13.845 --> 41:15.211
Do you have any idea?

41:15.213 --> 41:19.448
I'm gonna have to get ahold of the shaman,
we'll start there.

41:19.450 --> 41:22.635
I have sage in my drawer. I'll start saging.

41:22.637 --> 41:24.019
We'll get through this,

41:24.021 --> 41:27.189
and we'll get out of here
and we'll have a better time.

41:27.191 --> 41:29.325
I mean, right now,
we're just living in our own hell.

41:31.995 --> 41:33.329
You didn't think it was gonna be this rough?

41:33.331 --> 41:34.864
I knew it was gonna be rough.

41:34.866 --> 41:37.099
I just didn't know it
was gonna be this rough.

41:37.101 --> 41:41.504
There's a silver lining,
you know what caused your fighting,

41:41.506 --> 41:44.356
which caused you guys to be
on the verge of breaking up.

41:44.358 --> 41:46.842
Maybe now you know why,
maybe you can work things out.

41:46.844 --> 41:48.043
That'd be nice.

41:48.045 --> 41:51.080
Yeah, I just got to get back to being myself again

41:51.082 --> 41:52.581
and things might be better.

41:52.583 --> 41:56.252
I really wish I had
better news for Lori and Devin,

41:56.254 --> 42:00.156
but the activity surrounding
their home is so powerful.

42:00.158 --> 42:01.957
The only way to ensure their safety

42:01.959 --> 42:04.460
is to get as far away from
this property as possible.
