00:37.971 --> 00:39.107
I'M GOING TO CALL THEIR BLUFF.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.809
>> WE DON'T BELIEVE JESSICA HAS
ALL THIS POWER.

00:41.842 --> 00:45.846
THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE SURE SHE
DOESN'T IS TO PUT JESSICA AND

00:45.879 --> 00:48.949
CODY ON THE BLOCK.

00:48.982 --> 00:51.552
>> THEY WANTED A BACK-UP PLAN IN

TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT YOU
COMPETE.

01:18.646 --> 01:20.148
WHY BE TEMPTED TO COMPETE?

01:20.181 --> 01:22.416
BECAUSE THE WINNER OF THIS
COMPETITION WILL EARN SAFETY FOR

01:22.450 --> 01:24.685
THE WEEK.

PAUL NOMINATES CODY AND I, AND
EVEN THOUGH IT'S FRUSTRATING

04:13.587 --> 04:16.023
THAT WE ARE ON THE BLOCK, SO I
HAVE THE HEX THIS WEEK.

04:16.056 --> 04:18.626
SHOULD I CHOOSE TO USE IT, WE'RE
BOTH SAFE.

04:18.659 --> 04:20.294
I THOUGHT PAUL WAS SMARTER THAN.

04:20.328 --> 04:22.796
THIS I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOOD
GAME PLAY.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.231
>> REALLY, GUYS?

04:24.264 --> 04:29.303
>> LIKE YOU GUYS DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT PAUL WAS GOING TO DO.

04:29.337 --> 04:30.504
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

04:30.538 --> 04:32.506
>> DON'T BULL [BLEEPED] JESSICA.

04:32.540 --> 04:33.273
>> LET I GOT.

04:33.307 --> 04:36.344
>> GET THE [BLEEPED] OUT OF

04:36.377 --> 04:39.413
>> I'M RELIEVED I'M NOT
NOMINATED THIS WEEK, BUT I FEEL

04:39.447 --> 04:42.350
LIKE I'M CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE
WITH MY FRIENDSHIP WITH JESS AND

04:42.383 --> 04:43.617
MY FRIENDSHIP WITH PAUL.

04:43.651 --> 04:46.420
HE'S H.O.H. THIS WEEK, SO I FEEL
LIKE I NEED TO STICK CLOSE WITH

04:46.454 --> 04:47.521
HIM.

04:47.555 --> 04:50.023
>> I DON'T THINK CODY AND
JESSICA HAVE THE TEMPTATION.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.425
>> NAH.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.660
I DON'T THINK SO.

04:52.693 --> 04:55.629
>> I'M THE THIRD NOMINEE THIS
WEEK ON THE BLOCK BECAUSE I BOWL

04:55.663 --> 04:57.931
LIKE A DRUNKEN MONKEY.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.233
JESS AND CODY ARE ON THE BLOCK
NEXT TO ME.

05:00.267 --> 05:03.236
IF THERE WAS EVER A TIME I WAS
GOING THE FEEL SAFE ON THE

>> JUST COME.

05:21.154 --> 05:21.855

05:28.862 --> 05:29.897
DON'T SPEAK.

05:29.930 --> 05:30.864
PLEASE DON'T SPEAK.

05:30.898 --> 05:36.169
>> BEFORE YOU GUYS GET ALL
WEIRD, LET ME TALK.

05:36.203 --> 05:39.840
I GENUINELY WHOLEHEARTEDLY
BELIEVED YOU WHEN YOU SAID YOU

05:39.873 --> 05:40.474
HAVE SAFETY.

05:40.508 --> 05:41.375
THAT MAY STILL BE THE CASE.

05:41.409 --> 05:43.544
>> YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU JUST
DID, PAUL.

05:43.577 --> 05:44.812
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

05:44.845 --> 05:49.049

SCENARIO FOR YOU, YOU'RE H.O.H.

05:49.082 --> 05:52.420
YOU NOMINATING BOTH OF US,
YOU'LL SEE, BUT YOU SHOULD NOT

05:52.453 --> 05:53.353
HAVE DONE THAT.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.889
>> OKAY, JUST LISTEN TO ME FOR A
SECOND.

05:55.923 --> 05:58.726
NINE PEOPLE, THE WHOLE HOUSE IS
SAYING THAT YOU TWO GUARANTEE

05:58.759 --> 06:01.862
YOU HAVE SAFETY, THEN I KNOW
THAT NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO YOU

06:01.895 --> 06:02.930
TWO.

06:02.963 --> 06:05.098
>> AND YOU DO WHAT NINE PEOPLE
TELL YOU TO DO, PAUL?

06:05.132 --> 06:06.967
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SMARTER IN
THIS GAME, PAUL.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.570
>> DUDE, I HAVE EVERYTHING...

06:09.603 --> 06:12.105

06:16.410 --> 06:18.912
>> EVERY TWO SECONDS DOWN THERE
YOU'RE SAYING HOW MUCH YOU KNOW

06:18.946 --> 06:21.248
THIS GAME, PAUL, AND YOU
REALIZE...

06:21.281 --> 06:23.451
>> I'M NOT SAYING HOW MUCH I
KNOW THIS GAME.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.385
>> I'M ON DAY 130 NOW.

06:25.419 --> 06:26.353
>> I AM.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.021

USED IN THIS GAME BEFORE.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.433
WHAT I HAVE IS A NEW THING.

06:39.467 --> 06:40.568
YOU WON'T SEE IT COMING.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.169
YOU SHOULD HAVE ASKED QUESTIONS.

06:42.202 --> 06:43.170
>> LOWER YOUR VOICE.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.005
>> DON'T TELL HER TO LOWER HER
VOICE.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.106
>> CALM DOWN, DUDE.

06:46.139 --> 06:49.342
>> YOU TREAT THOSE PEOPLE LIKE
THEY'RE DOGS DOWN THERE.

06:49.376 --> 06:50.210
DON'T SAY IT TO JESSICA.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.980
>> I CAN TELL JESSICA TO LOWER
HER VOICE.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.716
>> CODY, BACK OUT, LEAVE THIS
ROOM.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.651

07:02.122 --> 07:02.756
LEAVE THIS ROOM.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.058
LEAVE THIS ROOM, DUDE.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.160
>> WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
ABOUT IT, PAUL?

07:07.194 --> 07:09.663
>> NOTHING, BECAUSE I'M AN
ADULT.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.499
>> THOUGHT SOME BE A KID
OUTSIDE.

07:11.532 --> 07:14.935
>> ALWAYS GOT TO HAVE THE LAST
WORD, PAUL.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.137
>> DUDE, YOU CAN BE BIG AND BAD.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.072

YOU'RE A SHOWMAN, RIGHT.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.349

07:29.382 --> 07:30.484
GROW UP.

07:30.518 --> 07:33.153
>> NO, NO, I GET IT, PAUL,

07:35.088 --> 07:36.423
GROW UP.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.357

08:04.918 --> 08:06.186
>> I DON'T GIVE A...

08:06.219 --> 08:07.220
>> I DO.

08:07.254 --> 08:09.657
BECAUSE THIS IS AT THE END OF
THE DAY A GAME.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.593
>> JESSICA, HIM TELLING YOU TO
LOWER YOUR VOICE.

08:12.626 --> 08:16.363
>> OH, MY GOD, THERE ARE SO MUCH
WORSE THINGS SOMEBODY COULD SAY.

08:16.396 --> 08:17.865
CODY, I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.768
I APPRECIATE YOU DEFENDING ME,
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS

08:20.801 --> 08:21.935
IS A GAME.

08:21.969 --> 08:26.740
>> LISTEN, I'M GOING TO PUT MY
HEART AND SOUL INTO THIS.

08:26.774 --> 08:28.776
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

08:28.809 --> 08:31.211
>> WE DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE IT
PERSONAL.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.846
YOU ESCALATED IT.

08:32.880 --> 08:37.551
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS IS A
GAME, AND YOU GOING THERE, LIKE

08:37.585 --> 08:38.118
WHY BOTHER?

08:38.151 --> 08:38.819

08:38.852 --> 08:42.890
>> I CARE.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.024
WHAT?

08:44.057 --> 08:45.158
>> JUST HAVE MY BACK.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.394

08:47.427 --> 08:51.231
THIS WAR, YOU ARE MAKING ME GO
THROUGH THIS FOR A SECOND TIME.

08:51.264 --> 08:52.099
>> I DON'T CARE.

08:52.132 --> 08:56.269
>> I DON'T WANT TO DO IT AGAIN.

08:56.303 --> 08:57.404
IT'S RIDICULOUS TO ME.

08:57.437 --> 08:59.740
I THOUGHT WE HIT ROCK BOTTOM
ALREADY.

08:59.773 --> 09:03.010
>> I DIDN'T PUT US IN THIS
POSITION.

LITERALLY OVER WHAT?

09:37.110 --> 09:38.846
YOU REALLY LIKE TESTING ME.

09:38.879 --> 09:42.916
YOU REALLY LIKE TESTING ME, WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO AND WHAT I CAN'T

TESTING YOU.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.388
>> I NEED TO BE ALONE RIGHT NOW.

09:48.421 --> 09:52.592
>> THAT'S WHY I'M SINGLE.

09:52.626 --> 09:54.261
>> DON'T TRY TO GET IN MY FACE.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.263
>> I CAN'T STAND HIM.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.430
I'M TIRED OF HOLDING BACK.

09:57.464 --> 10:01.702
>> CLEARLY THEY'RE BOTH PUT ON
THE BLOCK AND THEY WANT THE

10:01.735 --> 10:02.836
CAUSE CONFRONTATION.

10:02.870 --> 10:07.574
IF YOU WANT THE GET ALL HOT
HATED, PAUL, PAUL, WAH, WAH,

10:07.607 --> 10:07.908
WAH.

10:07.941 --> 10:08.776
>> LOSER.

10:08.809 --> 10:09.743
THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.979
HE STOMPS AROUND HERE LIKE HE
OWNS THE PLACE.

10:12.012 --> 10:15.315
POOR JESSICA'S CAUGHT IN THE
MID-LE WITH THAT DOUCHEBAG.

10:15.348 --> 10:18.085
>> PAUL, SHUT THE [BLEEPED] UP
ABOUT IT.

10:18.118 --> 10:21.855
>> YOU SHUT THE [BLEEPED] UP.

10:21.889 --> 10:23.190
WHY ARE YOU INVOLVING YOURSELF?

10:23.223 --> 10:24.457
YOU WANT TO GET IN IT?

10:24.491 --> 10:25.592
>> SHUT THE [BLEEPED] UP.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.795
>> YOU SHUT THE [BLEEPED] UP.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.897
WHEN YOU HAD TO STEP UP, YOU
DIDN'T.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.131
SO DON'T STEP UP NOW.

10:31.164 --> 10:32.265
SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.935
GO HIDE BEHIND CODY, BECAUSE YOU
NEED HIM TO BACK YOU UP.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.204
YOU WANT TO GUN FOR ME, I'LL
[BLEEPED] YOU.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.006
DO IT.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.974
>> I'M WAITING, JOSH.

10:41.008 --> 10:41.574
I'M WAITING.

10:41.608 --> 10:42.976
>> I HAVE ALREADY, BUDDY.

10:43.010 --> 10:43.811
YOU PROVE MY POINT.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.178
WHY YOU HAVE TO DEFEND CODY.

10:45.212 --> 10:49.116
HE'S A GROWN-ASS MAN.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.784
DOMINIQUE WASN'T OUT HERE
GETTING IN PEOPLE'S FACES.

10:50.818 --> 10:53.954
SHE WAS BEING HER DAMN SELF.

10:53.987 --> 10:57.490
YOU SHOULD HAVE STOOD UP FOR
DOMINIQUE, BUT YOU WANT TO

10:57.524 --> 10:59.426
DEFEND SOMEBODY GETTING IN
PEOPLE'S FACES.

10:59.459 --> 11:00.761
YOU'RE A JOKE.

11:00.794 --> 11:01.695
YOU'RE A JOKE.

11:01.729 --> 11:06.066
YOU ARE A JOKE, AND YOU'RE A
BIG, FAT BULLY.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.868
>> JOSH, JOSH...

11:07.901 --> 11:09.970
>> CLEARLY.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.304
WHAT'S THAT FACE FOR?

11:11.338 --> 11:16.209
>> I'M JUST ENJOYING THIS SO
MUCH.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.145
>> YOU SUCK.

11:18.178 --> 11:21.048
YOUR PERSONALITY SUCKS.

11:21.081 --> 11:25.886
YOU'RE BLAND AS... WHAT'S FUNNY?

11:25.919 --> 11:28.255
>> NOT MUCH.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.791
>> WHAT'S FUNNY?

11:30.824 --> 11:39.699
WHAT'S FUNNY?

11:39.733 --> 11:42.102
>> GET THE [BLEEPED]
>> DON'T TOUCH.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.871
DON'T TOUCH.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.105
>> GO OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW.

11:45.138 --> 11:51.178
>> HE'S COMING AT ME WITH PANS.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.179
>> OUTSIDE THE HOUSE.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.580
>> DON'T TOUCH ME.

11:53.613 --> 11:55.615
DON'T TOUCH ME.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.860
>> COME ON.

12:06.894 --> 12:09.462
COME BACK OVER HERE.

12:09.496 --> 12:16.403
>> HE'S SUCH A COWARD.

12:16.436 --> 12:23.610
>> WHATEVER.

12:23.643 --> 12:27.680
>> NOBODY SAID ANYTHING TO JOSH.

12:27.714 --> 12:35.789
>> THEY ALL WANT HIM HERE.

12:35.823 --> 12:40.127
>> I WAS BULLIED AS A KID, AND
IT JUST STRIKES A NERVE.

12:40.160 --> 12:43.596
EVER SINCE I LEARNED WHERE THE
GYM WAS, I NEVER GOT BULLIED,

12:43.630 --> 12:53.173
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN IT DOESN'T
HURT.

12:53.206 --> 12:56.543
AND IT HURTS EVEN MORE JUST TO
SEE OTHER PEOPLE JUST STAND BACK

12:56.576 --> 12:58.711
AND WATCH AND LISTEN.

12:58.745 --> 13:04.952
I MEAN, IT'S PATHETIC.

13:04.985 --> 13:11.191
>> I THINK JESSICA MIGHT BE
DOWNSTAIRS.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.392
>> WHY?

13:12.425 --> 13:17.030
>> SHE'S PISSED OFF AT HOW I
HANDLED IT, PAUL TELLING HER TO

13:17.064 --> 13:17.530
LOWER HER VOICE.

13:17.564 --> 13:21.434
SHUT UP, DUDE.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.770
FOR MY SANITY, YOU'RE GOING TO
BE IN THIS HOUSE NEXT WEEK,

13:23.803 --> 13:24.804
RIGHT?

13:24.838 --> 13:27.807
>> WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

13:27.841 --> 13:32.345
I'M NOT WINNING THIS GAME
ANYWAY.

13:32.379 --> 13:39.419
>> IT'S NOT OVER.

13:39.452 --> 13:40.988
JESSICA'S CONVINCED I'M A
VILLAIN NOW.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.155
>> SHE'LL CALM DOWN.

13:42.189 --> 13:50.097
>> EVEN IF HE DOES, HER DEFAULT
IS ALWAYS TO BLAME ME.

13:50.130 --> 13:55.002
ME AND -- YOU AND ELENA COOL?

13:55.035 --> 13:56.904
>> PROBABLY NOT AFTER THAT.

13:56.937 --> 14:03.643
THAT'S WHATEVER.

14:03.676 --> 14:04.811
>> I'M SORRY.

14:04.844 --> 14:05.979
THAT WAS NOTHING AGAINST YOU.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.314
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.582
>> I NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS GOING
TO GO THAT WAY.

14:09.616 --> 14:13.186
>> I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO
REVEAL SOMETHING AND YOU WOULD

14:13.220 --> 14:14.387
BE SAFE.

14:14.421 --> 14:17.457
>> WITH BOTH CODY AND I ON THE
BLOCK, I HAVE TO USE THE HEX.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.992
>> OKAY, RIGHT.

14:19.026 --> 14:22.329
BUT WHY ARE YOU GUYS SO FREAKING
OUT ABOUT IT.

14:22.362 --> 14:28.035
>> BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT THE
USE THE HEX.

14:28.068 --> 14:31.871
>> THE HEX IS JUST EVERYONE
COMES OFF OF THE BLOCK, SO ME

14:31.905 --> 14:36.543
AND CODY, JASON, OFF OF THE
BLOCK, YOU CAN'T COMPETE NOW.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.745
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT TO YOU,
PAUL.

14:38.778 --> 14:43.917
>> JESS, I DIDN'T DO THIS TO YOU
AND CODY TO SEND YOU HOME.

14:43.951 --> 14:47.287
EVEN IF THIS HAPPENS, AT LEAST
NINE PEOPLE ARE NOT QUESTIONING.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.556
I PUT YOU TWO UP SO IT WOULD
END.

14:49.589 --> 14:52.926
I THOUGHT THE SPARKLE WOULD
APPEAR, YOU WOULD SAY WHAT YOUR

14:52.960 --> 14:55.362
TEMPTATION IS AND YOU WOULD
NOMINATE TWO OTHER PEOPLE?

14:55.395 --> 14:55.996
>> YES.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.297
>> WHAT'S THE POINT OF THAT?

14:57.330 --> 15:00.600
>> HAD I NOT DONE, THAT THEN
PEOPLE WOULD SAY HOW COME I'M

15:00.633 --> 15:02.569
NOT PUTTING CODY UP.

15:02.602 --> 15:06.473
THIS IS REPAIRABLE, HAD HIS
REACTION NOT BEEN THAT WAY.

15:06.506 --> 15:09.676
I'M A CHARACTER ON THE SHOW,
HE'S RIGHT, BUT I'M NOT A CHILD

15:09.709 --> 15:15.182
AND I'M NOT ABOUT TO LOSE
SOMETHING I'VE WORKED HARD OVER

15:15.215 --> 15:17.884
IF SOME KID THAT CAN'T CONTROL
HIS EMOTIONS.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.753
IF YOU LET THAT ANCHOR HER DOWN.

15:20.787 --> 15:26.960
>> IF THERE IS SOME WAY I CAN
CONVINCE JESSICA CODY IS

15:26.994 --> 15:31.664
TERRIBLE FOR HER GAME AND I GET
TO SEND CODY HOME.

15:31.698 --> 15:35.168
>> THE REASON YOUR NAME GETS
TOSSED AROUND IS BECAUSE OF

15:35.202 --> 15:41.975
CODY.

15:42.009 --> 15:43.776
CODY IS A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL
PERSON.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.278
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.447
HE DID NOT HAVE TO ACT OUT THE
WAY HE DID.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.083
THAT'S NOT CLEAR TO YOU AT THIS
POINT, THEN IT WILL NOT BE CLEAR

15:50.117 --> 15:52.019
TO YOU FOR THE REST OF THIS
GAME.

15:52.052 --> 16:04.364
YOU NEED TO MAKE A DECISION
HERE.

16:04.397 --> 16:11.438
>> HEY, ELAY NARCOTIC CAN YOU
COME UP, PLEASE.

16:11.471 --> 16:15.408
-- HEY, ELENA, CAN YOU COME UP,
PLEASE?

16:15.442 --> 16:20.380
SO NOW I'M PRETTY SURE BASED OFF
THE CONVERSATION I JUST HAD WITH

16:20.413 --> 16:23.416
JESSICA I KNOW WHAT THE HEX IS,
BUT SHE COULD BE LYING AGAIN TO

16:23.450 --> 16:24.584
SAVE HERSELF.

16:24.617 --> 16:27.654
SHE'S LIKE, I STILL HAVE THE
OPTION TO USE THE HEX, AND IT

16:27.687 --> 16:28.921
WOULD MAKE IT A DUD WEEK.

16:28.955 --> 16:32.259
SO THEN I GET THIS ANGLE, JESS,
YOU'RE NOT A TARGET TO ANYBODY,

16:32.292 --> 16:37.430
BUT THE ONLY REASON WHY YOU ARE
A TARGET IS BECAUSE OF CODY.

16:37.464 --> 16:40.400
AND I'M LIKE, I KNOW YOU GUYS
LIKE EACH OTHER, BUT IF YOU WANT

16:40.433 --> 16:43.470
TO FURTHER THIS GAME, CODY IS
THE ONE BRINGING YOU DOWN, CODY

16:43.503 --> 16:45.372
WILL ALWAYS BE PUBLIC ENEMY
NUMBER ONE.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.674
IF THEY CAN'T GET CODY, THEY'RE
GETTING YOU.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.809
IF YOU DON'T OPEN YOUR EYES TO
THAT, THAT'S YOUR MISTAKE.

16:49.842 --> 16:54.614
IF THE SITUATION IS REPAIRABLE,
A.K.A., LET US SEND CODY HOME

16:54.647 --> 16:57.484
AND WE WON'T TOUCH YOU.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.820
IF WE ALL DO THIS, JESSICA,
SHE'S ONLY TARGETED BECAUSE

17:00.853 --> 17:04.891
CODY, IS I THINK SHE MIGHT LET
US KICK HIM OUT OF THIS GAME.

17:04.924 --> 17:05.592
>> OKAY.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.360
>> THE SHOWMANCE KILLER IS BACK.

17:16.969 --> 17:17.470
>> A LITTLE HEARTBROKEN.

17:17.504 --> 17:19.005
A LITTLE FRUSTRATED.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.874
PAUL HAS GIVEN US SOME INSIGHT
ABOUT THE HEX.

17:21.908 --> 17:23.276
I DECIDED TO TALK TO HEX.

17:23.310 --> 17:26.179
I THOUGHT I'D LET HER NO CODY IS
NO GOOD FOR HER GAME.

17:26.213 --> 17:30.117
>> WHY DID I SPEND TWO WEEKS
TRYING TO REPAIR RELATIONSHIPS

17:30.150 --> 17:32.519
FOR MY NAME TO BE OFFERED UP FOR
UNTIL NATIONS?

17:32.552 --> 17:36.723
>> CAN BY SUPER BLUNT WITH YOU?

17:36.756 --> 17:37.924
>> UH-HUH.

17:37.957 --> 17:41.261
>> HAD CODY NOT RETURNED, YOU
WOULD HAVE BEEN WAY UNDER THE

17:41.294 --> 17:51.304
RADAR.

17:51.338 --> 17:56.976
RADAR.

17:57.009 --> 17:59.011
>> JESSICA'S MAD AT ME.

17:59.045 --> 18:00.147
SHE WANTS SOME SPACE.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.281
SO I GRAB MY STUFF.

18:01.314 --> 18:02.982
I BRING IT TO THE HAVE NOT ROOM.

18:03.015 --> 18:03.916
I'M GOING TO GIVE HER THE
DISTANCE.

18:03.950 --> 18:05.718
>> DO YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE.

18:05.752 --> 18:06.819
>> NO.

18:06.853 --> 18:09.656
>>I'M NOT GOING TO CHASE HIM.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.524
WHY AM I GOING TO CHASE HIM?

18:11.558 --> 18:21.868
IF THAT'S HOW YOU ACT IN
REALITY, I CAN'T HAVE THAT.

18:21.901 --> 18:22.469
I'M GOING TO BE HERE FOR TWO
WEEKS.

18:22.502 --> 18:25.572
THE HEX, NOBODY GOES HOME.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.340
NO ONE IS GOING HOME THIS WEEK.

18:27.374 --> 18:32.212
IF I FELT LIKE I WAS IN DANGER
OR SOMEONE I WAS IN DANGER, I

18:32.245 --> 18:33.380
COULD STOP THE EVICTION.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.915
>> JESSICA DOESN'T KNOW THAT
PAUL ALREADY TOLD ME ABOUT HER

18:35.948 --> 18:37.450
HEX THAT SHE HAS.

18:37.484 --> 18:41.221
SO I'M PLAYING ALONG, BUT I'M
GOING TO LET HER KNOW THAT SHE

18:41.254 --> 18:46.092
SHOULDN'T USE THIS HEX.

18:46.125 --> 18:52.665
>> CODY IS THE ONLY PERSON IN
THIS GAME I CAN COUNT ON TO NOT

18:52.699 --> 18:57.136
COME AFTER ME.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.339
EVEN REGARDLESS OF HOW HE IS
FEELING.

18:59.372 --> 19:02.008
>> I THINK YOU CAN CHANGE THAT.

19:02.041 --> 19:05.278
>> I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WORK FOR
EVERYONE'S TRUST ANYMORE.

19:05.312 --> 19:08.215
I'M NOT BEGGING PEOPLE FOR
ANYTHING.

19:08.248 --> 19:13.286
>> I'M GOING TO PUT THIS AS
POLITELY AS POSSIBLE, KEEPING

19:13.320 --> 19:17.089
CODY BY YOUR SIDE ENSURES THAT
NOBODY TRUSTS YOU.

19:17.123 --> 19:21.794
NOT HAVING CODY BY YOUR SIDE
GIVES PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

19:21.828 --> 19:24.197
CONTINUE THAT.

19:24.231 --> 19:27.734
A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST DON'T
TRUSTS CODY.

19:27.767 --> 19:33.673
BUT YOU AND CODY TOGETHER IS
SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T SET WELL

19:33.706 --> 19:37.009
WITH A LOT OF MEMBERS OF THE
HOUSE.

19:37.043 --> 19:40.146
IF YOU DON'T USE IT THIS WEEK,
CODY GOES HOME.

19:40.179 --> 19:43.149
IF HE DOESN'T WIN THIS VETO.

19:43.182 --> 19:48.255
YOU USE IT THIS WEEK, PEOPLE
WILL SEE YOU AS THE THREAT.

19:48.288 --> 19:51.691
SAVING YOU AND CODY, NOBODY IS
GOING TO WANT TO WORK WITH YOU

19:51.724 --> 20:00.400
AND THEY'RE GOING TO WANT YOU
OUT ASAP.

20:00.433 --> 20:04.237
>> DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WANT
THE SAY TO ME?

20:04.271 --> 20:09.041
>> I'M SORRY.

20:09.075 --> 20:13.913
>> I'M SORRY DOESN'T COVER IT.

20:13.946 --> 20:17.250
AND I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU HAVE TO
ANSWER TO IN YOUR LIFE, BUT IN

20:17.284 --> 20:24.190
MY LIFE, I AM A REPRESENTATION
OF MY FAMILY, AND I HAVE A JOB,

20:24.223 --> 20:29.028
AND THOSE PEOPLE EXPECT ME TO
BEHAVE IN A SPECIFIC WAY, AND I

20:29.061 --> 20:32.231
DON'T WANT TO BE DATING A
HOTHEAD WHO I HAVE TO WORRY

20:32.265 --> 20:38.871
ABOUT GETTING INTO FISTFIGHTS
CONSTANTLY, AND THAT IS WHAT I

20:38.905 --> 20:39.772
SAW TODAY.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.275
>> I RUINED YOUR GAME.

20:42.309 --> 20:44.043
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

20:44.076 --> 20:51.651
AND IF I RUINED ANYTHING OUTSIDE
OF THE GAME, I... YOU HAVE NO

20:51.684 --> 20:55.054
IDEA HOW MUCHLY REGRET IT AND
HOW SORRY I AM.

20:55.087 --> 21:01.328
AND I REALIZE THIS IS... I DON'T
THINK I CAN BALANCE YOU OUT THE

21:01.361 --> 21:03.162
WAY YOU WANT ME TO BALANCE YOU
OUT.

21:03.195 --> 21:04.531
>> YOU DON'T WANT TO OR YOU
CAN'T?

21:04.564 --> 21:06.933
>> I CAN'T.

21:06.966 --> 21:10.202
>> CONSIDERING EVERYTHING I'VE
DONE FOR YOU, THIS IS THE

21:10.236 --> 21:12.572
RESPONSE THAT I'M GETTING FROM
YOU?

21:12.605 --> 21:15.842
YOU PACK YOUR BAGS OUT OF THE
ROOM, YOU COME SLEEP IN HERE,

21:15.875 --> 21:20.847
AND THEN YOU'RE JUST LAYING ON
YOUR BED LIKE THIS IS JUST

21:20.880 --> 21:21.848
ABSOLUTELY MEANINGLESS?

21:21.881 --> 21:24.517
>> I WAS JUST GIVING YOU SOME
TIME AND SPACE.

21:24.551 --> 21:25.718
THAT'S IT.

21:25.752 --> 21:28.588
>> YOU'RE GIVING ME TIME AND
SPACE, AND THEN WHEN I COME AND

21:28.621 --> 21:31.090
TELL YOU, YOU TELL ME YOU HAVE
NOTHING LEFT TO OFFER ME.

21:31.123 --> 21:37.263
>> SEE, I... I... I FEEL LIKE
WHATEVER I SAY, LIKE I'M NOT

21:37.296 --> 21:38.865
GOING TO SAY THE RIGHT THING
RIGHT NOW.

21:38.898 --> 21:43.035
I WANT TO SAY THE RIGHT THING,
BUT LIKE I AM NOT... I'M

21:43.069 --> 21:44.371
FAILING.

21:44.404 --> 21:50.643
I'M LIKE FAILING HARD.

21:50.677 --> 21:54.280
I'M NOT TRYING TO DIG MYSELF
INTO A BIGGER HOLE WITH YOU.

21:54.313 --> 21:57.917
>> I DIDN'T TAKE YOU FOR A
QUITTER, CODY.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.986
>> SEE, THERE IT IS.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.754
>> APPARENTLY I WAS WRONG.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.490
YOU'RE IN THE CAPABLE OF GIVING
ME WHAT I WANT.

22:03.523 --> 22:06.426
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT?

22:06.459 --> 22:07.627
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

22:07.660 --> 22:09.295
>> I DON'T WANT ANYTHING FROM
YOU.

22:09.328 --> 22:09.896
HOW ABOUT THAT?

22:09.929 --> 22:17.370
>> OH, MY GOSH.

22:17.404 --> 22:30.717
>> I JUST WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY.

22:30.750 --> 22:35.254
>>>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

22:35.287 --> 22:36.989
THAT BEHAVIOR, IF THAT'S HOW YOU
ACT IN THE REAL WORLD, THAT'S

22:37.023 --> 22:38.024
IS THAT HOW YOU ACT?

22:38.057 --> 22:39.291
>> AT TIME, YES.

22:39.325 --> 22:41.394
>> YOU CAN'T ACT LIKE THAT.

22:41.428 --> 22:43.430
>> I DON'T TRY TO.

23:22.469 --> 23:36.449
>> HOW ARE YOU AND MARK?

23:36.483 --> 23:40.386
>> I GENUINELY CARE ABOUT
JESSICA, AND REALLY BELIEVE THAT

23:40.419 --> 23:43.756
CODY GOING HOME THIS WEEK IS THE
BEST THING FOR HER GAME, SO I'M

23:43.790 --> 23:46.726
HOPING THAT SINCE WE'RE PRETTY
CLOSE SHE TAKES MY ADVICE AND

23:46.759 --> 23:50.296
DOESN'T USE THE HEX AND LETS US
JUST VOTE HIM OUT THIS WEEK.

23:50.329 --> 23:55.334
>> HE'S BAD FOR YOUR GAME AND
FOR MY GAME, BECAUSE I AM

23:55.367 --> 23:56.569
ASSOCIATED WITH YOU.

23:56.603 --> 24:02.775
>> I'M REALLY TORN BECAUSE THE
WAY THAT HE ACTED IS ABSOLUTELY

24:02.809 --> 24:05.745
NOT OKAY.

24:05.778 --> 24:08.715
>> SHE IS A PART OF A SOCIAL
TEAM THAT I'M NOT PART OF.

24:08.748 --> 24:11.984
>> RIGHT.

24:12.018 --> 24:15.121
I MEAN, I'LL NEVER BE PART OF A
SOCIAL TEAM.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.524
>> THAT AIN'T ME.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.458
>> WHAT WAS HE DOING?

24:19.492 --> 24:23.896
>> HE WAS IN PAUL'S FACE
SCREAMING.

24:23.930 --> 24:27.834
IF THAT'S HOW HE ACTS IN HERE,
IS THAT HOW HE ACTS OUTSIDE IF.

24:27.867 --> 24:31.671
>> SHE ASKED ME, OH, ARE YOU
LIKE THIS OUT IN THE REAL WORLD?

24:31.704 --> 24:32.939
I'M LIKE, I AM.

24:32.972 --> 24:36.543
>> THAT'S FIRST THING I THOUGHT
OF WHEN MARK GOT INTO HIS FACE.

24:36.576 --> 24:42.782
I WAS JUST LIKE, IN NO WAY IS
THAT ACCEPTABLE.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.250
>> I'M IN THE SAME BOAT.

24:44.283 --> 24:45.084
>> I KNOW.

24:45.117 --> 24:47.954
I KNOW.

24:47.987 --> 24:51.791
>> WHEN I LOOK AT IT RATIONALLY,
I'M LIKE, DO I THROW AWAY MY

24:51.824 --> 24:54.761
GAME FOR SOMEONE THAT I MET 38
DAYS AGO.

24:54.794 --> 24:57.496
BUT WHEN I LOOK AT IT WITH
EMOTION, IT'S HARD TO DISREGARD

24:57.530 --> 24:58.464
HIM.

24:58.497 --> 25:01.333
LIKE HOW DO I MOVE FORWARD NOW,
AND WITH WHO?

25:01.367 --> 25:04.336
>> ME OUT OF THIS GAME WILL HELP
HER THE MOST.

25:04.370 --> 25:07.940
I DON'T WANT HER TO WASTE SAFETY
ON ME.

25:07.974 --> 25:10.810
THAT'S HER BEST CHANCE OF
WINNING $500,000.

25:10.843 --> 25:13.079
>> I STILL HAVE FEELINGS FOR
JESSICA.

25:13.112 --> 25:14.246
THOSE WON'T GO AWAY.

25:14.280 --> 25:17.550
IF I CAN JUMP ON A GRENADE AND
SAVE JESSICA'S GAME, I WILL.

25:17.584 --> 25:18.985
SHE ACTUALLY HAS CHANCE AT
WINNING.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.052
I DO NOT.

25:20.086 --> 25:22.755
>> I WANT THE STAY IN THIS GAME
AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.

25:22.789 --> 25:24.957
I WANT TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR MY
GAME.

25:24.991 --> 25:26.593
AND I THINK YOU SHOULD DO THE
SAME.

25:26.626 --> 25:29.461
>> I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO
DO.

25:29.495 --> 25:35.301
IF I DIDN'T USE THE HEX THIS
WEEK, I WOULD HAVE A HAND IN

25:35.334 --> 25:47.346
CODY'S EVICTION.

25:47.379 --> 25:48.615
>> WHAT'S UP?

25:48.648 --> 25:54.120
>> WHAT I KNOW IS I FELL FOR YOU
IN THIS HOUSE AND I DON'T REALLY

25:54.153 --> 25:58.390
KNOW ANYMORE WHAT IS GOING TO
HAPPEN BETWEEN US, BECAUSE YOU

25:58.424 --> 25:59.692
ARE DOING THINGS THAT...

25:59.726 --> 26:00.893
>> YOU HATE ABOUT ME.

26:00.927 --> 26:04.263
>> NO, YOU GETTING IN SOMEONE'S
FACE, CALLING THEM A LOSER,

26:04.296 --> 26:05.598
CURSING AT THEM.

26:05.632 --> 26:07.600
>> I THINK HE IS A LOSER IN
LIFE.

26:07.634 --> 26:10.069
I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL.

26:10.102 --> 26:13.706
AND I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO
ANOTHER CONVERSATION WITH HIM

26:13.740 --> 26:15.608
BECAUSE I WILL ACT LIKE THAT
EVERY DAMN TIME.

26:15.642 --> 26:18.745
>> CODY, YOU LIVE IN A SOCIETY
WITH PEOPLE.

26:18.778 --> 26:19.746
YOU CAN'T ACT LIKE THAT.

26:19.779 --> 26:22.514
>> AND YET SOMEHOW I MADE IT
THIS FAR.

26:22.548 --> 26:27.086
I DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS AND I'M
STILL SINGLE AND I'M VERY CLOSE

26:27.119 --> 26:29.789
TO MY FAMILY, SO YOU CAN SEE
WHERE THAT'S GOT ME.

26:29.822 --> 26:31.190
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO UP THERE.

26:31.223 --> 26:33.359
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO UP THERE AT
ALL.

26:33.392 --> 26:37.797
I AM INCREDIBLY SORRY...

26:37.830 --> 26:43.970
>> HE'S SO STUPID.

26:44.003 --> 26:47.774
>> I DON'T THINK I CAN EVERY
MAKE YOU HAPPY THE WAY YOU

26:47.807 --> 26:52.278
DESERVE TO BE HAPPY.

26:52.311 --> 26:55.682
AND THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO
ABOUT IT EXCEPT DISASSOCIATE

26:55.715 --> 26:56.949
MYSELF WITH YOU.

26:56.983 --> 26:57.917
>> CODY...

26:57.950 --> 27:01.587
>> I WANT YOU TO WIN THIS GAME
BECAUSE I CAN'T.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.489
>> I'M NOT GOING TO WIN THIS
GAME.

27:03.522 --> 27:06.859
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

27:06.893 --> 27:09.395
YOU HAVE AN AMAZING CHANCE TO DO
IT.

27:09.428 --> 27:11.063
I'M TRYING TO JUMP ON A GRENADE
FOR YOU.

27:11.097 --> 27:16.202
>> I DON'T NEED ANYONE TO JUMP
ON A DWRA NADINE -- DWRA NADINE

27:16.235 --> 27:17.469
FOR ME.

27:17.503 --> 27:20.139
>> YOU WITH ME IN THIS GAME, YOU
WILL ALWAYS BE IN THE SAME HOLE

27:20.172 --> 27:21.340
FOR ME.

27:21.373 --> 27:23.042
THERE'S NO SOCIAL GAME TO BE
PLAYED THAT'S GOING TO INCREASE

27:23.075 --> 27:26.913
OUR CHANCES, NOT AS LONG AS I'M
IN THIS GAME WITH YOU.

27:26.946 --> 27:28.080
YOU COULD PLAY IT WITHOUT ME.

27:28.114 --> 27:30.616
>> SO YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO
TRY?

27:30.649 --> 27:33.720
>> I WILL TRY EVERYTHING I CAN
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY, BUT I CAN'T

27:33.753 --> 27:34.987
CHANGE WHO I AM.

27:35.021 --> 27:37.056
THIS IS WHO I AM.

27:37.089 --> 27:39.091
>> YOU ARE ALWAYS WRONG.

27:53.139 --> 27:57.877
>> YOU GET TO PUT MAKE-UP ON MY
FACE AND YOU GET TO PUT MAKE-UP

27:57.910 --> 27:58.644
ON YOUR FACE.

27:58.677 --> 27:59.445
>> I'LL DO IT.

27:59.478 --> 28:06.052
>> THIS IS A BB STORM WATCH
UPDATE.

28:06.085 --> 28:09.555
>> THIS IS BEETLES.

28:09.588 --> 28:10.189
THIS IS BEETLES.

28:10.222 --> 28:11.791
>> OH, MY GOODNESS.

28:11.824 --> 28:12.992
IT'S FOR THE VETO.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.526
IT'S A VETO COMPETITION.

28:14.560 --> 28:18.030
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO STUDY MY
BUTT OFF, AND I KNOW I'M GOING

28:18.064 --> 28:20.132
TO BE UP ALL NIGHT LONG.

28:20.166 --> 28:20.933
HELP ME, LORD.

28:20.967 --> 28:26.705
>> THIS IS A BB STORM WATCH
UPDATE.

28:26.739 --> 28:29.608
THE BB WEALTH CHANNEL IS
TRACKING A MINOR WEATHER EVENT

28:29.641 --> 28:31.177
CALLED BB STORM CAMERA.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.979
IT ONLY LAST 11 HOURS.

28:33.012 --> 28:36.248
SOME RESIDENTS ARE QUESTIONING
FOR THE STORM EVEN HAPPENED.

28:36.282 --> 28:38.417
ALSO TRACKING BB STORM JILLIAN.

28:38.450 --> 28:41.320
IT STARTED OUT AS A MASSIVE
WEATHER SYSTEM WITH STRONG

28:41.353 --> 28:42.321
GUSTS.

28:42.354 --> 28:49.261
BUT IT WAS DOWNSIZED AFTER GOING
THROUGH TIJUANA.

28:49.295 --> 28:55.401
>> THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THEM
ALL NIGHT.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.837
>> YOU WANT TO GO UP THERE?

28:57.870 --> 28:58.404
>> NO.

28:58.437 --> 29:03.142
>> WELL, IT'S 11 HOURS.

29:03.175 --> 29:04.543
>> 11 HOURS.

29:04.576 --> 29:05.778
AT LEAST WE FINALLY KNOW.

29:05.812 --> 29:10.950
>> THIS IS A BB STORM WATCH
UPDATE.

29:10.983 --> 29:18.090
>> BB STORM DOMINIQUE HAS
ROARING THUNDER.

29:18.124 --> 29:21.027
THIS TERRIBLE TORRENT IS
TWISTING TOWARD THE TEMPLE OF

29:21.060 --> 29:21.460
TEMPTATION TONIGHT.

29:21.493 --> 29:23.095
STAY TUNED.

29:23.129 --> 29:26.265
>> I'M LOSING MY MIND.

29:26.298 --> 29:27.967
YOUR BOY NEEDS HIS BEAUTY REST.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.036
I NEED TO SLEEP.

29:30.069 --> 29:33.172
I NEED TO LOOK GOOD IN THE
MORNING BECAUSE ALL THESE

29:33.205 --> 29:43.749
SHOWMANCES ARE SPLITTING UP AND
YOUR BOY MIGHT JUST GET LUCKY.

29:43.782 --> 29:48.988
>> THIS IS A BB STORM WATCH
UPDATE.

29:49.021 --> 29:51.557
>> UNREAL.

29:51.590 --> 29:58.497
>> BB METEOROLOGISTS ARE STUNNED
BY THE DISCOVERY OF BB STORM

29:58.530 --> 29:59.465
RAMSES.

29:59.498 --> 30:03.735
DESPITE BB STORM RAMSES
CONTAINING LIGHTNING,

30:03.769 --> 30:05.637
METEOROLOGISTS INSIST IT'S STILL
NOT LIT.

30:05.671 --> 30:08.640
>> AT THIS POINT I DON'T KNOW
WHO IS WHAT AND WHAT'S WHERE.

30:08.674 --> 30:11.844
I JUST WANT TO GO TO SLEEP
BECAUSE I'M GETTING KIND OF

30:11.878 --> 30:17.683
CRANKY AND I'M NOT GOING TO WIN
CRANKY.

30:17.716 --> 30:26.392
>> METEOROLOGIST.

30:26.425 --> 30:28.027
>> HEY, EVERYONE.

30:28.060 --> 30:30.997
IT'S TIME TO PICK PLAYERS FOR
THE VETO COMPETITION.

30:31.030 --> 30:31.797
>> YEAH.

30:31.830 --> 30:38.905
>> YEAH.

30:38.938 --> 30:41.073
ISM ONLY SIX PEOPLE WILL
PARTICIPATE IN THE VETO

30:41.107 --> 30:42.274
COMPETITION.

30:42.308 --> 30:45.377
THE HEAD OF HOUSELOAD, THREE
NOMINEES, AND TWO OTHERS PLAYERS

30:45.411 --> 30:46.378
SELECTED BY RANDOM DRAW.

30:46.412 --> 30:49.882
WILL THE MOM KNEES PLEASE JOIN
ME UP HERE?

30:49.916 --> 30:53.152
>> I GOT THE MAKE SURE JESSICA
AND CODY DON'T WIN THE VETO.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.853
THEY'RE CLAIMING THEY HAVE SOME
SORT OF POWER.

30:54.887 --> 30:57.656
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T
HAVE ANY MORE OF IT.

30:57.689 --> 31:00.927
SO I HAVE TO PICK SOMEONE WHO
HAS A GOOD MEMORY WHO WILL DO AS

31:00.960 --> 31:02.394
WELL IF NOT BETTER THAN I AM.

31:02.428 --> 31:06.098
>> I AS HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD WILL
PULL TWO CHIPS OUT OF THE BOX TO

31:06.132 --> 31:09.068
DETERMINE THE OTHER PLAYERS
COMPETING IN THE VETO

31:09.101 --> 31:10.236
COMPETITION.

31:10.269 --> 31:12.771
IF I PULL THE CHIP OF MYSELF OR
ONE OF THREE NOMINEE, THAT

31:12.804 --> 31:20.546
PLAYER WILL GET TO CHOOSE A
PLAYER OF THEIR CHOICE.

31:20.579 --> 31:24.050

[APPLAUSE]
RAVEN.

31:36.762 --> 31:42.034
[APPLAUSE]
RAVEN.

31:43.669 --> 31:48.374
[APPLAUSE]
BIG BROTHER WILL INFORM US WHEN

31:48.407 --> 31:50.142
THE COMPETITION IS TO BEGIN.

31:50.176 --> 32:00.052
GOOD LUCK.

32:00.086 --> 32:03.222
>> I WALK INTO THE BACKYARD AND
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A STORM ON

32:03.255 --> 32:04.256
THE HORIZON.

32:04.290 --> 32:10.963
THEN I SEE A FLYING SHARK AND
ABALLIGATOR AND HALF

32:10.997 --> 32:11.763
SEAGULL-HALF LOBSTER.

32:11.797 --> 32:14.166
WE'RE DEFINITELY NOT IN IOWA

>> TRYOUTS FOR THE BB WEATHER
TEAM.

32:16.668 --> 32:17.769
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

32:17.803 --> 32:20.239
WHEN THE TELEPROMPTER BEGINS,
START READING THE WEATHER

32:20.272 --> 32:21.473
REPORT.

32:21.507 --> 32:23.609
EVERY TIME THERE IS A BLANK IN
THE SCRIPT, FILL IT IN BY SAYING

32:23.642 --> 32:26.312
THE CORRECT BB STORM NAME THAT
CORE RESPONDS TO THE INFORMATION

32:26.345 --> 32:28.714
THAT YOU HEARD LAST NIGHT.

32:28.747 --> 32:32.918
THE ANSWER WILL EITHER BE
CAMERON, JILLIAN, DOMINIQUE, OR

32:32.951 --> 32:34.186
RAMSES.

32:34.220 --> 32:36.788
YOU MUST GIVE EACH ANSWER BEFORE
THE BLANK DISAPPEARS BEFORE THE

32:37.889 --> 32:40.226
EACH CORRECT BB STORM ANSWER

32:40.259 --> 32:42.894
THE REPORTER WITH THE MOIST

CURRENTLY IN THE EYE OF THE

32:47.533 --> 32:47.966
STORM.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.101
SO GET READY.

32:49.135 --> 32:52.438
THINGS ARE ABOUT TO GET INTENSE.

32:52.471 --> 32:54.506
ARE YOU READY THE PLAY UNDER THE
WEATHER?

32:54.540 --> 32:57.576
>> I WANT TO WIN AND PULL MYSELF
OFF THE BLOCK.

32:57.609 --> 33:02.181
EVEN THOUGH THERE'S BIG TARGETS
ON THE BLOCK, I STILL WOULD

33:02.214 --> 33:05.151
RATHER GUARANTEE MY OWN SAFETY
THAN LEAVE IT UP TO SOMEBODY

33:05.184 --> 33:07.019
ELSE.

33:07.053 --> 33:10.756
>> LET'S GO LIVE TO OUR BB
WEATHER REPORTER JASON THUNDER

33:10.789 --> 33:13.559
TO SEE IF HE'S WRANGLED UP A
REPORT FOR US.

33:13.592 --> 33:15.194
TAKE IT AWAY.

33:15.227 --> 33:18.764

33:23.635 --> 33:25.537
A LOT OF STORMS HERE.

33:25.571 --> 33:29.007
LUCKILY ONE OF THE STORMS WENT
THROUGH, AND THAT STORM WAS BB

33:29.041 --> 33:29.975
CAMERON.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.710
>> THE WIND IS BLOWING
EVERYTHING.

33:31.743 --> 33:35.614
IT'S LIKE BEING IN THE MIDDLE OF
A RODEO ON THE BACK OF A 2000

33:35.647 --> 33:36.448
POUND BULL.

33:36.482 --> 33:41.420
AND I'M JUST HANGING ON FOR DEAR
LIFE.

33:41.453 --> 33:45.524
YOU FOLKS OVER AT BLOCKBUSTER
MAY BE B INTERESTED TO KNOW THAT

33:45.557 --> 33:49.628
THE STORM THAT SPENT MOST OF ITS
TIME WAS STORM CAMERON.

33:49.661 --> 33:52.998
I CAN BARELY HEAR MYSELF THINK.

33:53.031 --> 33:59.138
WELL, I'M COMPLETELY SOAKED FROM
HEAD TO TOE.

33:59.171 --> 33:59.471
YEAH.

33:59.505 --> 33:59.971
NO.

34:00.005 --> 34:03.175
I STILL GOT IT.

34:03.209 --> 34:05.644
I FOR ONE WILL NEVER BE THE
SAME.

34:05.677 --> 34:08.647
REPORTING FROM BB WEATHER, I'M

NOW TO CODY CLOUD.

34:19.325 --> 34:23.329
>> I'M CODY CLOUD COMING TO YOU
LIVE WITH A BB WEATHER UPDATE.

34:23.362 --> 34:27.065
THESE CONDITIONS ARE CRAZY AND
GETTING WORSE.

34:27.099 --> 34:28.367
ACHOO.

34:28.400 --> 34:36.375
FUN FACT, THE HIGHWAYS WERE HIT
WITH A MIX OF FREEZING RAIN BY

34:36.408 --> 34:37.443
BB DOMINIQUE.

34:37.476 --> 34:41.046
LAST NIGHT THERE WAS A STORM
CAUSED BY A DUST DEVIL.

34:41.079 --> 34:44.350
IT WAS CALLED BB STORM RAMSES.

34:44.383 --> 34:47.052
THIS CAST OF WEATHER EVENTS IS
REALLY, REALLY LOUD.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.820
I CAN BARELY HEAR MYSELF THINK.

34:48.854 --> 34:52.358
IT'S FAR CRY FROM THE STORM THAT
STARTED OFF AS A QUIET SYSTEM,

34:52.391 --> 34:54.560
BB STORM DOMINIQUE.

34:54.593 --> 34:57.329
OKAY.

34:57.363 --> 34:59.131
>> RAIN, RAIN IS HERE TO STAY.

34:59.165 --> 35:03.702
WITH BB WEATHER REPORTER RAVEN
RAIN ON THE SCENE.

35:03.735 --> 35:05.737
>> I'M RAVEN RAIN.

35:05.771 --> 35:10.376
COMING TO YOU LIVE AT THE BB
WEATHER UPDATE.

35:10.409 --> 35:17.916
THE GREATEST WEATHER EVENT EVER
WAS BB STORM CAMERON.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.618
NEW HEALTHY RESPECT FOR
WEATHERMEN OUT THERE.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.019
HOLY COW.

35:21.052 --> 35:28.827
FOR THOSE OF YOU -- BB STORM --
THAT WAS BB STORM... I DON'T

35:28.860 --> 35:29.595
KNOW.

35:29.628 --> 35:32.598
BACK TO YOU.

35:32.631 --> 35:36.502
>> IT'S TIME TO CHECK IN WITH
THE ONLY MAN TO KEEP HIS TIE

35:36.535 --> 35:39.070
STRAIGHT IN 100MPH WINDS.

35:39.104 --> 35:43.209
KEVIN LIGHTNING.

35:43.242 --> 35:45.076
>> DRIVERS NEED TO BE CAREFUL
OUT THERE.

35:45.110 --> 35:51.683
THE HIGHWAYS WERE HIT WITH A MIX
OF FREEZING RAIN AND ICE.

35:51.717 --> 35:52.651
DOMINIQUE.

35:52.684 --> 35:56.154
WATER VAPORS ARE NOT FOR THE BB
STORM CAMERON.

35:56.188 --> 35:58.190
>>ITES RAINING HEAVY.

35:58.224 --> 35:59.325
THERE'S SHARKS COMING BY.

35:59.358 --> 36:02.228
IT REMINDS ME OF A NOR'EASTER IN
THE FALL BACK IN BOSTON.

36:02.261 --> 36:06.265
I DON'T REMEMBER REAL SHARKS
COMING BY, BUT A FEW LOAN SHARKS

36:06.298 --> 36:07.299
GOING BY.

36:07.333 --> 36:09.000
HEY, YOU GOT MY MONEY?

36:09.034 --> 36:13.605
IT HAS BEEN A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN
THE BB NEIGHBORHOOD.

36:13.639 --> 36:17.843
>> AND NOW WE GO TO OUR REPORTER
WHO ISN'T AFRAID TO GET HER FEET

36:17.876 --> 36:19.010
WET, JESSICA PUDDLE.

36:19.044 --> 36:23.148
>> I'M JESSICA PUDDLE COMING TO
YOU LIVE WITH A BB WEATHER

36:23.181 --> 36:24.383
UPDATE.

36:24.416 --> 36:27.253
>> EVEN THOUGH CODY AND I ARE
GUARANTEED SAFETY BECAUSE OF THE

36:27.286 --> 36:30.922
HEX, I STILL WANT TO WIN THE
POWER OF VETO TO HAVE MY OPTIONS

36:30.956 --> 36:32.924
OPEN.

36:32.958 --> 36:35.461
EXPERTS TRACK SOMETHING
TROPICAL, AND TERRIBLE OUT OF

36:35.494 --> 36:38.330
THE TWISTED OR THE RENT, THE
TEMPLE OF TEMPTATION.

36:38.364 --> 36:41.233
THAT STORM WAS BB STORM
DOMINIQUE.

36:41.267 --> 36:47.473
THIS JUST IN, PEDESTRIANS ARE
BEING PESTERED BY UNPREDICTABLE

36:47.506 --> 36:47.873
PRECIPITATION.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.708
OH, MY GOD.

36:49.741 --> 36:55.814
>> NOW TO OUR VETERAN REPORTER
ON THE SCENE, PAUL CLUSTER.

36:55.847 --> 36:59.951
>> FOR THOSE VIEWERS WHO ARE
JUST JOINING US NOW, THE TWO

36:59.985 --> 37:03.188
UNIMPRESSIVE STORMS WERE BB
STORM JILLIAN AND BB STORM

37:03.221 --> 37:04.623
CAMERON.

37:04.656 --> 37:07.959
>> I GOT THE MAKE SURE I WIN
THIS POWER OF VETO, BECAUSE IF I

37:07.993 --> 37:11.430
HAVE ALL THE POWER, MAYBE I CAN
STRIKE A DEAL THAT MIGHT JUST BE

37:11.463 --> 37:14.433
ENTICING ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE MY
H.O.H. DOESN'T GO TO WASTE.

37:14.466 --> 37:17.336
TIME FOR A BIRTHDAY SHOUT-OUT.

37:17.369 --> 37:30.949
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO LONGEVITY AND
HER PET SQUIRREL.

37:30.982 --> 37:33.819
THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO REPORT ON
THIS HISTORIC DISPLAY OF WARM

37:33.852 --> 37:34.753
WEATHER.

37:34.786 --> 37:38.089
REPORTING FOR BB WEATHER, I'M
PAUL FLUSTER.

37:38.123 --> 37:39.157
BACK TO YOU.

37:39.190 --> 37:43.629
>> LET'S SEE HOW YOU ALL DID
WITH UNDER THE WEATHER.

37:43.662 --> 37:51.202
RAVEN, YOU HAD A SCORE OF 16.

37:51.236 --> 37:55.407
LET'S SEE IF CODY CAN BEAT THAT.

37:55.441 --> 37:58.009
>> HURRY UP.

37:58.043 --> 37:59.578
>> 15.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.813
>> I'M IN THE LEAD.

38:01.847 --> 38:05.216
OH, MY GOSH.

38:05.250 --> 38:14.660
>> PAUL IS IN THE LEAD WITH 22
POINTS.

38:14.693 --> 38:16.362
JASON, SORRY, JASON.

38:16.395 --> 38:18.630
NOT ENOUGH TO BEAT PAUL.

38:18.664 --> 38:26.071
>> OH, MY GOSH.

38:26.104 --> 38:28.774
KEVIN, LET'S SEE HOW YOU DID?

38:28.807 --> 38:29.140
SORRY, KEVIN.

38:29.174 --> 38:30.208
>> I'M DONE.

38:30.241 --> 38:31.209
I'M DONE.

38:31.242 --> 38:36.081
>> AND LAST, JESSICA, LET'S SEE
HOW YOU DID, 12.

38:36.114 --> 38:40.986
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT
HAPPENED.

38:41.019 --> 38:46.692
PAUL, YOU'RE BB OUT OF THE
WEATHER WITH 22 POINTS.

38:46.725 --> 38:50.696
>> THE WEATHERMAN IS BACK IN
ACTION, AND I THINK I JUST GOT A

38:50.729 --> 38:51.897
PROMOTION.

38:51.930 --> 38:55.066
SO NOW I GOT TO CONCENTRATE ON
THIS WEEK AND SOMEHOW USE THIS

38:55.100 --> 38:59.405
POWER TO ENTICE JESSICA NOT TO
USE HER HEX SO I CAN SEND CODY

38:59.438 --> 39:01.440
OUT OF THIS GAME ONCE AGAIN.

39:19.090 --> 39:19.558
>> OKAY.

39:19.591 --> 39:19.925
TIME FOR US TO CHAT.

39:19.958 --> 39:25.063
>> OH, GOD.

39:25.096 --> 39:26.698
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN TROUBLE.

39:26.732 --> 39:28.834
LIKE I'M GETTING CALLED INTO THE
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.101
>> KIND OF, BUT YOU'RE NOT IN
TROUBLE.

39:30.135 --> 39:33.505
>> SO I GOT THE TALK TO JESSICA,
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH PRETTY MUCH

39:33.539 --> 39:37.008
THE ENTIRE HOUSE HAS BEEN TRYING
TO CONVINCE HER THAT CODY BAD

39:37.042 --> 39:37.843
FOR HER GAME.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.210
I'M NOT TOTALLY CONVINCED IT'S
WORKING.

39:39.244 --> 39:42.514
SO I HAVE ONE MORE CARD TRICK TO
PLAY.

39:42.548 --> 39:48.454
>> I'M HERE TO LAY DOWN SOME
FACTS, AND YOU SAID CODY IS THE

39:48.487 --> 39:52.724
ONLY ONE WHO PROTECTS YOU.

39:52.758 --> 39:56.828
THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS THAT
CODY HAS HAD WITH PEOPLE THAT

39:56.862 --> 39:57.596
DOESN'T KEEP YOU SAFE.

39:57.629 --> 39:58.764
>> YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
EXPLAIN.

39:58.797 --> 39:59.965
>> OKAY.

39:59.998 --> 40:03.769
IN THE FIRST FEW WEEKS OF THIS
GAME, CODY TOLD MATT THE ONLY

40:03.802 --> 40:08.474
REASON HE WANTS TO KEEP ALEX IN
THIS HOUSE IS SO THAT THEY WOULD

40:08.507 --> 40:13.011
TAKE YOU AND RAVEN OUT.

40:13.044 --> 40:18.950
I MEAN, ARE YOU LOOKING AT
WORKING ALEX AND JASON LONG-TERM

40:18.984 --> 40:19.818
HERE?

40:19.851 --> 40:21.853
>> THERE'S NO WAY I COULD GO
AFTER RAVEN.

40:21.887 --> 40:24.990
>> SOMEBODY'S GOING TO HAVE TO
TAKE THEM OUT AND IT CAN'T BE

40:25.023 --> 40:25.591
US.

40:25.624 --> 40:26.758
>> OH, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

40:26.792 --> 40:29.060
>> AH.

40:29.094 --> 40:33.565
>> WHEN PAUL TELLS ME THAT CODY
HAS BEEN TALKING BEHIND MY BACK,

40:33.599 --> 40:38.970
HE'S MAKING ME QUESTION WHAT
HE'S DOING.

40:39.004 --> 40:40.506
AND WHAT HIM AND I ARE.

40:40.539 --> 40:44.242
ON A PERSONAL LEVEL AND A GAME
LEVEL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

40:44.275 --> 40:47.813
IF I DECIDED TO NOT USE THE HEX,
THERE ARE THINGS THAT I WANT IN

40:47.846 --> 40:48.313
EXCHANGE.

40:48.346 --> 40:49.615
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT?

40:49.648 --> 40:50.882
TELL ME AND MAKE IT HAPPEN.

40:50.916 --> 40:54.252
>> FOR TWO EVICTIONS I DON'T
WANT TO GO ON A BLOCK, NOT EVEN

40:54.285 --> 40:58.690
AS A PAWN, AND I WANT WHOEVER
WINS H.O.H. TO TAKE OUT ALEX.

40:58.724 --> 41:01.893
>> FIRST ONE I CAN GUARANTEE
YOU.

41:01.927 --> 41:03.061
BECAUSE IT'S VERY EASY.

41:03.094 --> 41:06.331
LOOK, IF YOU PUT JESSICA ON THE
BLOCK, NO MATTER WHAT YOUR

41:06.364 --> 41:07.432
AGENDA IS, BOOM.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.367
>> I WANT THE SECOND THING MORE.

41:09.400 --> 41:09.935
>> OKAY.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.469
I CAN TRY TO HELP YOU.

41:11.503 --> 41:13.739
BUT IT ALSO DEPENDS WHO WINS
H.O.H.

41:13.772 --> 41:16.875
>> WELL, THEN YOU TALK TO
WHOEVER YOU HAVE TO TALK TO AND

41:16.908 --> 41:18.109
GET BACK TO ME.

41:18.143 --> 41:21.446
>> IF THEY WANT TO TAKE CODY OUT
THAT BAD, I WANT SOMETHING IN

41:21.479 --> 41:24.783
RETURN, AND THAT'S ALEX'S HEAD
ON A STICK.

41:24.816 --> 41:28.086
>> THE SECOND THING IS SOMETHING
I CAN'T GUARANTEE BECAUSE I

41:28.119 --> 41:28.787
DON'T KNOW...

41:28.820 --> 41:30.388
>> BUT YOU HAVE EVERYONE'S EAR.

41:30.421 --> 41:32.157
>> I DON'T HAVE EVERYONE'S EAR.

41:32.190 --> 41:35.861
>> TALK THE PEOPLE, BECAUSE IF
THERE IS A BUT ABOUT IT, THEN

41:35.894 --> 41:39.798
I'M JUST GOING TO USE THE HEX.

41:42.167 --> 41:42.734
TAKE AS LONG AS YOU NEED.

41:42.768 --> 41:44.435
YOU HAVE A COUPLE DAYS.

41:44.469 --> 41:45.436
>> WAIT.

41:45.470 --> 41:46.772
HOLD THE PHONE.

41:46.805 --> 41:50.508
YOU'RE ACTUALLY CONSIDERING NOT
USING THE HEX AND ALL I HAVE TO

41:50.542 --> 41:54.580
DO IS SOMEHOW CONVINCE YOU THAT
IF ONE OF US WINS H.O.H. WE PUT

41:54.613 --> 41:58.684
ALEX UP AND SEND HER HOME, SURE.

41:58.717 --> 42:00.218
LET'S MAKE THIS DEAL.

42:00.251 --> 42:02.821
>> I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO
THIS...

42:02.854 --> 42:05.824
>> WELL, I NEED THE TALK TO CODY
RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE WHAT YOU JUST

42:05.857 --> 42:07.225
SAID TO ME...

42:07.258 --> 42:14.332
>> CHOOSE YOUR ACTIONS WISELY.

42:21.607 --> 42:22.874
>> THE HOUSE HAS NEVER GIVEN ME
ANYTHING I WANT, SO IF I'M GOING

42:22.908 --> 42:26.277
TO GIVE THE HOUSE WHAT THEY WANT
BY TAKING OUT CODY, I'M GOING TO

42:26.311 --> 42:29.414
GET SOMETHING BIG IN EXCHANGE.

42:29.447 --> 42:34.786
>> I GUESS CODY MIGHT BE GOING
HOME ON THURSDAY.

42:34.820 --> 42:39.457
>> WILL JESSICA SACRIFICE HER
SHOWMANCE OR WILL SHE UNLEASH

42:39.490 --> 42:41.292
THE HALTING HEX THE SAVE IT?

42:41.326 --> 42:45.563
PLUS WITH THE LIVE EVICTION IN
JEOPARDY, THE ENTIRE HOUSE

42:45.597 --> 42:46.798
EXPLODES.

42:46.832 --> 42:54.472
