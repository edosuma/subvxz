WEBVTT

00:07.924 --> 00:11.094
I've never met a world champion
that's a normal person.

00:11.594 --> 00:14.097
You gotta be screwed up in some manner

00:14.180 --> 00:16.891
to get out of bed
to do extraordinary things.

00:18.059 --> 00:19.144
And I'm screwed up.

00:29.571 --> 00:34.534
Underneath this veneer
of being a normal, nice guy,

00:35.452 --> 00:36.995
I have a huge ego.

00:38.997 --> 00:42.876
There's gotta be some motivation
to drive someone to extraordinary lengths.

00:46.379 --> 00:49.883
And the ego is part of my drive.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.010
Good morning, the world.

00:52.093 --> 00:53.762
We're lining up now for the start

00:53.845 --> 00:57.682
of the seventh and vital race
in this America's Cup.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.559
Yachting's big event is more historic

00:59.642 --> 01:02.187
than the Kentucky Derby,
the World Series or the Super Bowl.

01:02.270 --> 01:07.650
And for the first time in 132 years,
America may lose the America's Cup.

01:11.821 --> 01:15.116
Now, the whole point of this
was to win the America's Cup,

01:16.201 --> 01:18.328
which no one had ever done before.

01:20.371 --> 01:23.458
It was the longest winning streak
in history of sport.

01:23.541 --> 01:27.253
The United States
having successfully defended the Cup

01:27.837 --> 01:31.716
for 132 years,
since before the US Civil War.

01:32.801 --> 01:36.346
This country's domination
has outlasted the Confederacy,

01:36.429 --> 01:38.848
the Third Reich, and the St. Louis Browns.

01:39.641 --> 01:42.393
Now the Australians think
their time finally has come.

01:45.355 --> 01:49.859
Today they sail the winner-take-all,
do-or-die, there's-no-tomorrow race.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.569
Billed as the race of the century--

01:51.653 --> 01:54.280
The greatest yacht race of the century.

01:58.201 --> 02:00.370
The bottom line is the New York Yacht Club

02:00.453 --> 02:03.081
were not in the business
of losing the America's Cup.

02:04.749 --> 02:07.085
So we had no confusion.

02:07.627 --> 02:08.878
We were at war.

02:09.462 --> 02:12.257
The full-scale war is already underway.

02:12.340 --> 02:15.468
The Australians claim they're
the target of a dirty-tricks campaign

02:15.552 --> 02:18.304
involving espionage
and political backstabbing.

02:18.388 --> 02:22.392
We now have the FBI involved,
spies, armed guards.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.187
The New York Yacht Club
are absolutely determined

02:26.271 --> 02:28.106
to do everything possible to ensure

02:28.189 --> 02:31.151
that the Cup stays here
in the United States.

02:31.860 --> 02:37.282
To take on the United States
was a huge psychological mountain.

02:38.741 --> 02:42.579
The most powerful nation technically
and economically in the world…

02:42.662 --> 02:45.415
-…and a little country…

02:47.333 --> 02:50.420
with 27 million people called Australia…

02:54.257 --> 02:56.676
…had the audacity to think
that we could do it.

04:05.078 --> 04:09.415
The first America's Cup that I'd heard
was the 1962 America's Cup.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.293
Australia versus United States.

04:13.711 --> 04:16.756
How this country was tuned into this event
halfway around the world.

04:18.007 --> 04:21.135
These races have captured
the imagination of millions.

04:21.719 --> 04:23.388
The President of the United States himself

04:23.471 --> 04:25.598
abandons the cares of Washington
to attend.

04:26.599 --> 04:29.978
The Australians, if they win,
see it as an opportunity

04:30.061 --> 04:34.023
to project their little-known country
onto the international stage.

04:34.565 --> 04:36.109
I can… I can still hear it.

04:36.192 --> 04:38.987
<i>Winds 20 to 25 knots and seas choppy…</i>

04:39.070 --> 04:42.073
I was just a little boy
listening on the wireless.

04:42.907 --> 04:46.744
I was seven years old
listening to a small transistor radio,

04:46.828 --> 04:48.663
lying in bed in the middle of the night.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.581
A little tiny transistor radio.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.792
Like a little transistor radio.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.836
My mother said,
"You get a good night's sleep,"

04:54.919 --> 04:56.838
and I'm trying to listen to the radio.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.756
<i>…all over</i>
<i>the eastern seaboard</i>

04:58.840 --> 05:00.800
<i>flock to the waters of Newport,</i>
<i>Rhode Island.</i>

05:00.883 --> 05:02.135
Three in the morning,

05:02.218 --> 05:05.805
12 hours different time zone
in Newport, Rhode Island.

05:08.891 --> 05:12.854
<i> This is Newport,</i>
<i>the home of the America's Cup yacht race.</i>

05:13.604 --> 05:15.064
<i>Since the turn of the century,</i>

05:15.148 --> 05:18.401
<i>it's been the holiday playground</i>
<i>of the nation's super rich.</i>

05:18.484 --> 05:22.530
As a little boy, I was infatuated
with the incredible history.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.576
All these incredible characters.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.496
<i> And when the summer breezes</i>
<i>begin to roll in across the sound,</i>

05:30.580 --> 05:34.459
<i>their minds turn</i>
<i>to the only game in town, yacht racing.</i>

05:37.920 --> 05:40.423
For me to skipper an America's Cup boat,

05:40.506 --> 05:43.384
that set my imagination
into another direction.

05:46.429 --> 05:49.265
It was like the door opening
to another world.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.166
There are some people at Internal Revenue

06:15.249 --> 06:18.378
who think yachting is not much more
than a dubious tax deduction.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.672
The America's Cup, however,
is something else again.

06:26.803 --> 06:31.349
The America's Cup's always been
the top echelon of the sport of sailing.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.907
The America's Cup
is one boat versus one boat,

06:47.990 --> 06:49.867
one country versus one country.

06:49.951 --> 06:51.536
The best of seven races.

06:52.620 --> 06:56.040
First boat to win four races
wins the America's Cup.

06:56.124 --> 06:59.127
It's one-on-one.
It's like a duel to the death.

07:01.504 --> 07:05.716
<i> Look at it go down!</i>
<i>This is yachting's answer to the Titanic.</i>

07:05.800 --> 07:09.470
They basically have a desire
to beat each other's brains out,

07:09.554 --> 07:13.182
but it's a lot better than going to war
or shooting it out in the streets.

07:14.016 --> 07:16.477
The unique element of the America's Cup

07:16.561 --> 07:19.480
is you're given a shot every four years,
just like the Olympics.

07:19.564 --> 07:23.985
It's a huge commitment,
both physically and psychologically.

07:24.861 --> 07:28.614
The rules were any country
could challenge for the America's Cup,

07:29.115 --> 07:33.744
but you had to design the boat
in the country you were challenging from.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.373
You had to build the boat
in that country as well.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.460
So these projects need money.

07:41.377 --> 07:42.211
Lots of money.

07:44.255 --> 07:48.009
The super-rich have brought
large bank accounts, millions of dollars.

07:48.759 --> 07:50.803
In the case of the America's Cup,

07:50.887 --> 07:53.848
we're talking high-cost,
high-tech yacht racing.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.101
Unlike any other sport,

07:57.935 --> 07:59.312
the US had never lost.

08:02.356 --> 08:04.233
It was the longest winning streak

08:04.317 --> 08:05.568
in sporting history

08:06.694 --> 08:10.656
where the New York Yacht Club
had successfully defended the Cup

08:10.740 --> 08:13.784
in Newport, Rhode Island, for 132 years.

08:15.161 --> 08:18.372
There was a sense of arrogance
by the New York Yacht Club.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.333
This is our patch.

08:20.416 --> 08:23.044
You can play with the patch
and then we'll bid you farewell.

08:23.961 --> 08:26.547
The New York Yacht Club
have defended this Cup

08:26.631 --> 08:28.549
against all-comers from around the world

08:28.633 --> 08:30.843
with such complete sailing mastery

08:30.927 --> 08:33.513
that it's a wonder
anyone comes after it at all.

08:40.603 --> 08:43.856
<i>The New York Yacht Club</i>
<i>on Manhattan's West 44th Street.</i>

08:44.524 --> 08:48.152
<i>With its windows carved in the manner</i>
<i>of a 17th century Dutch yacht,</i>

08:48.236 --> 08:50.613
<i>this is the center</i>
<i>of the yachting universe.</i>

08:51.113 --> 08:52.448
<i>The exclusive preserve</i>

08:52.532 --> 08:55.701
<i>of some of America's wealthiest</i>
<i>and most influential men.</i>

09:05.002 --> 09:10.299
The New York Yacht club were
ferocious defenders of the America's Cup.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.971
They reeked of old American money,

09:16.305 --> 09:18.474
Vanderbilts and Roosevelts.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.770
So there was a huge amount of mystique.

09:23.854 --> 09:26.315
And there was something
about the American boats.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.695
They had this aura about them.
They were immaculate.

09:31.362 --> 09:34.907
Their sails always looked like
they were carved out of alabaster.

09:38.035 --> 09:40.830
They oozed style, wealth.

09:40.913 --> 09:43.416
Oozed this unbeatableness.

09:48.504 --> 09:51.007
And one day, way back in 1970,

09:51.674 --> 09:53.759
we go into the New York Yacht Club.

09:54.302 --> 09:55.636
And there was a room,

09:55.720 --> 10:00.099
it was this kind of octagonal room
where the Cup was sitting.

10:04.854 --> 10:07.481
We spoke to the curator,
and he said, "You realize, John,

10:07.565 --> 10:11.902
that that trophy had not been touched
by human flesh for a hundred years."

10:16.198 --> 10:19.118
I looked at this trophy and I thought,
"My God, John, this is it."

10:19.201 --> 10:21.912
Perfect, shiny silver.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.748
The Holy Grail.

10:34.842 --> 10:36.469
This is the family jewel.

10:36.552 --> 10:37.928
Silver under glass.

10:38.471 --> 10:42.892
This is what the Americans are spending
$45 million on this year alone.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.935
Now, legend has it

10:45.019 --> 10:48.189
that the first American skipper
to end up losing this Cup

10:48.689 --> 10:50.066
will end up losing his head.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.573
There's no question the emerging force

10:57.657 --> 11:00.326
for the New York Yacht Club
was Dennis Conner.

11:01.077 --> 11:04.580
A native of San Diego, California,
folks, please welcome Dennis Conner.

11:06.165 --> 11:09.377
He was the might and focus
of the New York Yacht Club.

11:11.128 --> 11:13.130
And he took the America's Cup

11:13.214 --> 11:15.257
from an amateur world
to a professional world.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.467
Dennis changed the game.

11:16.550 --> 11:18.344
But isn't it true
that you've taken a sport

11:18.427 --> 11:22.181
that was, uh, previously considered
kind of what wealthy guys did on weekends,

11:22.264 --> 11:24.934
and turned it into
more like stock car racing?

11:29.897 --> 11:32.608
Dennis was the best. He was the best.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.403
Ah, he's brilliant, absolutely brilliant.

11:39.407 --> 11:42.618
I think it's fair to say
Dennis was a different person.

11:45.705 --> 11:51.043
One of these skippers
who will do anything to win.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.714
If the most important thing in the world

11:54.797 --> 11:57.925
was winning the America's Cup
and sailing with Dennis Conner,

11:58.008 --> 12:01.679
over going to church,
over your job, over your wife, your kids…

12:02.513 --> 12:05.349
"Oh, I gotta take off
for two weeks to go skiing."

12:05.433 --> 12:08.561
Well, enjoy your skiing,
but don't bother coming back.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.857
The first time I raced against Dennis

12:12.940 --> 12:14.942
was 1974, the America's Cup.

12:17.653 --> 12:18.904
And we had no chance.

12:21.407 --> 12:24.952
The Australians, they weren't
in the America's Cup business.

12:25.035 --> 12:27.705
Psychologically, you have to perform
at a very high level.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.708
You got down to the boat early

12:30.791 --> 12:33.878
and checked the weather,
tide, current, sailing instructions,

12:33.961 --> 12:36.630
got your boat in the water,
made sure it was smooth and clean,

12:36.714 --> 12:38.549
getting out to the course
and checking the wind,

12:38.632 --> 12:40.968
current, and the race committee
and getting instructions,

12:41.051 --> 12:43.554
and checking the wind before the start,
which way it was shifting.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.556
You had the right sails, the right mast.

12:45.639 --> 12:48.100
You'd practiced.
Your crew weighed the right amount.

12:48.184 --> 12:52.772
If you did all those things, every time,
you would then have no excuse to lose.

12:55.149 --> 12:58.903
Lambs to the slaughter each time.
Hammered in '74.

12:58.986 --> 13:02.364
<i> Dennis Conner came through</i>
<i>for America again today,</i>

13:02.448 --> 13:05.201
<i>winning the race</i>
<i>by more than a minute and a half.</i>

13:07.369 --> 13:09.205
Got hammered again in '77.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.332
<i>The experts said it'd be 4 and 0,</i>

13:11.415 --> 13:15.127
<i>and they've done in the Australians</i>
<i>four races to zero.</i>

13:15.211 --> 13:17.463
Went back again in 1980, got beaten again.

13:18.172 --> 13:20.299
<i>And Australia simply couldn't catch up</i>

13:21.008 --> 13:24.178
<i>and has now failed in three attempts</i>
<i>to win the America's Cup.</i>

13:25.095 --> 13:27.139
I won 38 straight races.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.643
I was the best sailor in the world.

13:32.561 --> 13:33.896
I slaughtered them.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.902
Welcome back to <i>Turpie Tonight.</i>

13:41.028 --> 13:42.571
Ah! What a cue!

13:43.405 --> 13:45.533
I want you to listen carefully to this.

13:45.616 --> 13:48.202
In September 1983,

13:49.078 --> 13:52.790
someone will be challenging the Americans
for the America's Cup,

13:53.415 --> 13:54.750
and this man will be skipper.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.837
Ladies and gentlemen,
would you please welcome John Bertrand?

14:00.714 --> 14:01.590
Deep down,

14:01.674 --> 14:05.427
I knew if there's anyone
that can actually take on Dennis Conner,

14:06.720 --> 14:07.972
it was someone like myself.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.478
How long have you been sailing?

14:15.020 --> 14:16.605
I started when I was 12 years old.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.900
-What type or class of yacht?
-Little Sabots, little trainers.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.026
Yeah?

14:21.110 --> 14:23.863
My great-grandfather
was involved in the construction

14:23.946 --> 14:25.573
of three America's Cup boats.

14:26.907 --> 14:29.285
My grandfather was
a professional fisherman,

14:30.536 --> 14:34.206
and he'd teach me
when the sea breeze would come in.

14:35.124 --> 14:38.752
He'd have this intuitive sixth sense
that was passed on to myself.

14:39.962 --> 14:42.840
No makeup. Is that what you get
from life on the ocean waves?

14:42.923 --> 14:44.300
It's hours in the sun, Ian.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.634
Hours and hours.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.303
Is this a hard life?

14:48.387 --> 14:51.599
But when I was 15,
there was a shock to our family.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.435
My father died,

14:54.518 --> 14:56.103
my grandfather died,

14:56.186 --> 14:59.481
and then my great-grandfather died,
in sequence.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.151
So we lost all the men.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.158
Um…

15:09.742 --> 15:13.871
When John's father passed away,
there was a call in him.

15:16.874 --> 15:20.085
It, in fact, was
what has always driven him.

15:22.379 --> 15:29.345
But what I really understood about John
was his ability to really focus.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.972
He could totally shut off.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.935
I was infatuated
with winning the America's Cup

15:36.852 --> 15:38.354
and what was required.

15:38.437 --> 15:42.316
Hopefully, you'll be the one to challenge
whatever yacht the Americans put up.

15:42.399 --> 15:45.986
That's right. Dennis Conner is
the skipper of the one boat,

15:46.070 --> 15:48.155
which he successfully defended last time.

15:48.238 --> 15:49.490
-Boo!

15:49.573 --> 15:51.367
-Didn't like him much.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.661
Every year losing to Dennis,

15:54.161 --> 15:57.706
I concluded that
I wasn't mentally tough enough.

16:01.001 --> 16:03.545
And unless you understood
your competition,

16:03.629 --> 16:05.965
unless you understood the enemy,

16:06.048 --> 16:08.342
you could never actually take it
to another level.

16:11.553 --> 16:14.181
So I got a scholarship to MIT in Boston

16:14.264 --> 16:19.395
in the Department of Ocean Engineering
to become part of the US system.

16:20.604 --> 16:21.981
<i> During this program,</i>

16:22.064 --> 16:24.358
<i>you'll be training</i>
<i>for careers in marine engineering.</i>

16:24.441 --> 16:28.779
<i>There will be lab work, sea projects,</i>
<i>and plenty of difficult classwork.</i>

16:29.571 --> 16:32.491
When he told me
the name of his thesis,

16:32.992 --> 16:35.577
I think, by then, I really understood

16:36.662 --> 16:39.957
how important sailing was to him.

16:40.040 --> 16:43.377
Optimum Angle of Attack
of America's Cup Sails.

16:49.383 --> 16:52.761
Using lifting-line theory,
aerospace engineering,

16:53.846 --> 16:56.140
highly technical control systems,

16:56.849 --> 16:58.434
basically torpedoes.

17:01.395 --> 17:03.522
I was behind enemy lines for months…

17:05.232 --> 17:07.776
learning about secrets.

17:07.860 --> 17:10.612
That was very applicable
to the America's Cup challenge.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.409
So, after MIT, I knew enough

17:15.492 --> 17:19.121
that we could go head-to-head,
toe-to-toe with the best in the world.

17:24.334 --> 17:25.335
Come on, Kyle.

17:30.507 --> 17:32.342
To compete,
you have to have the money.

17:32.426 --> 17:33.343
I just said,

17:33.844 --> 17:38.474
"When you want to race the America's Cup,
show me the money."

17:40.267 --> 17:42.686
I guess it's fair to say that estimates
about how much money

17:42.770 --> 17:44.354
has been spent to win this baby

17:44.438 --> 17:47.816
are anywhere between 60
and maybe 100 million dollars.

17:48.942 --> 17:50.152
I was lucky.

17:50.235 --> 17:52.863
I had the backing
of the New York Yacht Club.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.158
I loved them like Mom and Dad.

17:56.950 --> 18:01.205
So you get the money,
then you can start to put a team together.

18:01.288 --> 18:04.166
<i> Conner is putting his troops</i>
<i>through a training program</i>

18:04.249 --> 18:07.586
<i>as tough as any yet devised</i>
<i>for an America's Cup campaign.</i>

18:07.669 --> 18:10.839
It's important that the crew
be able to perform at their best,

18:10.923 --> 18:13.634
and to do so,
they have to have a full commitment,

18:13.717 --> 18:18.680
working- 00 in the morning till- 00
at night, six days a week for 17 months.

18:18.764 --> 18:22.518
So the more money,
you can start to invest in technology.

18:24.311 --> 18:26.146
Then you can start thinking about,

18:26.230 --> 18:28.690
"What kind of a designer
are we going to have?"

18:29.191 --> 18:32.486
"Who's gonna build the boat?
Who's gonna make the sails?"

18:35.239 --> 18:39.034
The New York Yacht Club
calls to order the first meeting…

18:39.118 --> 18:41.286
Studying the New York Yacht Club,

18:41.370 --> 18:43.997
I realize if we're ever to win this thing,

18:44.623 --> 18:48.710
we would need money, lots of money.

18:56.051 --> 18:58.303
The story of the America's challenge

18:58.387 --> 19:01.348
is the story
of the whole Bond financial saga.

19:02.015 --> 19:04.101
Bondy has always been a gambler,

19:04.935 --> 19:07.813
and that's what this is all about, money.

19:09.064 --> 19:11.817
Alan was the syndicate chairman
for Australia.

19:11.900 --> 19:12.901
He took a gamble.

19:14.069 --> 19:15.696
It was his money.

19:15.779 --> 19:17.322
It was his project.

19:18.699 --> 19:22.202
Bondy was a big risk-taker.
Larger than life.

19:22.953 --> 19:25.664
He'd made a lot of money
in a short amount of time,

19:26.415 --> 19:28.542
largely through property deals.

19:29.459 --> 19:30.961
And he bought Swan Brewery.

19:32.087 --> 19:36.550
But from the New York Yacht Club's
point of view, he wasn't real wealth.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.762
Alan intuitively knew

19:40.846 --> 19:45.058
to win could take him
from a local trader to a global trader.

19:45.684 --> 19:49.271
It was power and influence,
and that was his motivation.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.112
So, I said to Alan,

19:57.196 --> 19:59.907
"There's basically
three elements in this competition."

20:00.782 --> 20:03.327
"You gotta have
world-class administration."

20:03.410 --> 20:05.787
"You gotta have world-class technology,

20:05.871 --> 20:09.166
and, ultimately,
the team has to be world-class."

20:11.210 --> 20:15.339
We needed to get brilliant,
highly sophisticated minds.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.550
Invite the best of the best.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.096
So I called Huey.

20:24.848 --> 20:27.559
Got an apprenticeship
and I left school as a sailmaker.

20:29.186 --> 20:35.567
I can see wind shifts and wind pressure.
Just could almost smell the wind.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.737
<i>…and outstanding tactician Hugh Treharne</i>

20:38.820 --> 20:41.406
<i>join other senior members</i>
<i>of the Australian team.</i>

20:42.157 --> 20:44.368
<i>Is this the year of the impossible?</i>

20:44.451 --> 20:47.955
I was working as an engineer
on a uranium mine.

20:48.038 --> 20:49.831
I was actually a school teacher
at the time.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.792
I was working as an electrical engineer.

20:51.875 --> 20:54.962
And I get a phone call
out of the blue saying,

20:55.045 --> 20:57.256
"I'd like you to be the navigator

20:57.339 --> 21:00.342
on this 12 Metre we're gonna build
for the next America's Cup."

21:00.425 --> 21:03.303
I hadn't been a navigator on any boat.

21:04.221 --> 21:07.057
He said, "You're an engineer.
You go and figure it out."

21:07.808 --> 21:10.852
John Bertrand very carefully worked out

21:10.936 --> 21:14.022
the people with the right mental capacity,

21:14.106 --> 21:16.817
who could outsmart
the New York Yacht Club.

21:18.277 --> 21:21.196
To take on the power
of the American psyche,

21:21.697 --> 21:23.782
with their immense confidence,

21:23.865 --> 21:27.077
you need a strong ego
to be able to play that game,

21:27.160 --> 21:29.121
and that was a major hurdle.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.457
In our country, in Australia,

21:32.541 --> 21:34.584
we have this thing
called the Tall Poppy Syndrome,

21:35.585 --> 21:40.007
where people start to show a sense
of confidence, and they cut you down.

21:41.883 --> 21:44.594
So, if I could get
the mental side tough enough,

21:45.512 --> 21:47.973
then perhaps I could put
the whole thing together.

21:49.433 --> 21:51.893
Bertrand sent this psych test out

21:51.977 --> 21:54.604
to all of the potential crew members.

21:54.688 --> 21:58.317
And I can remember
getting this 14-page psych test

21:58.400 --> 22:00.444
and thinking, "What is this crap?"

22:00.527 --> 22:03.405
Yeah. I did the personality test.

22:04.614 --> 22:07.367
The assessment was
that I could have more confidence.

22:07.451 --> 22:11.121
That was the assessment, yeah,
that I could have more confidence.

22:11.955 --> 22:17.794
So for us, we had to believe ourselves
that we belong on the world stage.

22:18.462 --> 22:20.672
That's the power of visualization.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.843
See the sails, see fellow crew members,

22:25.677 --> 22:28.722
realize the trust, faith, and respect
you have for them.

22:28.805 --> 22:32.809
You're visualizing the environment
even before you've gone into battle.

22:34.561 --> 22:40.192
Ultimately, training the mind
not to be intimidated in that environment.

22:47.991 --> 22:49.993
<i> Listen to the helicopters above.</i>

22:50.077 --> 22:53.121
-<i>You see the US Coast Guard.</i>

22:54.581 --> 22:58.043
<i>We're all working</i>
<i>hand in hand together as a team.</i>

22:59.419 --> 23:00.962
<i>And then you see Dennis Conner…</i>

23:03.298 --> 23:05.675
<i>and his American boat, Liberty.</i>

23:06.593 --> 23:08.053
And finally,

23:08.136 --> 23:12.724
the last thing we had to have
was the high-tech, world-class boat.

23:13.392 --> 23:17.687
But the American sailing technology
was at a much higher level

23:17.771 --> 23:20.148
than anything we had in Australia.

23:21.483 --> 23:24.152
<i> The battle of the Cup</i>
<i>has become a war of technology,</i>

23:24.903 --> 23:27.697
<i>and Conner had wanted to build himself</i>
<i>a fearsome weapon.</i>

23:28.824 --> 23:32.577
<i>So he went to the heavily-guarded</i>
<i>US Government weapons research center.</i>

23:32.661 --> 23:35.539
Right now we have
naval architects involved.

23:36.039 --> 23:39.000
As a matter of fact, we have,
at the hub of our campaign,

23:39.084 --> 23:42.546
basically a subcontractor
from the Department of Defense.

23:43.880 --> 23:46.800
Dennis had US Navy
and aerospace technology.

23:47.551 --> 23:51.221
And he had big design teams,
like nearly 30 guys,

23:52.389 --> 23:55.308
but those days we just had Benny.

23:55.392 --> 23:57.310
We had Benny. That was it.

23:58.061 --> 24:01.398
<i> Seen here</i>
<i>is the barefoot Australian, Ben Lexcen.</i>

24:01.481 --> 24:05.152
<i>He's Alan Bond's unlikely choice</i>
<i>to design his yacht</i>

24:05.235 --> 24:08.071
<i>for the upcoming 1983 America's Cup.</i>

24:08.780 --> 24:12.826
<i>But where many designers live</i>
<i>in a world full of calculus and geometry,</i>

24:13.618 --> 24:16.204
<i>Ben Lexcen lives in a world of art.</i>

24:17.372 --> 24:19.291
Yacht design is still an art.

24:19.875 --> 24:23.795
It's probably one of the only arts left
where the artist has to prove his work

24:23.879 --> 24:25.714
by actual performance.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.132
Benny was different.

24:27.632 --> 24:29.759
He was not constrained in a box.

24:31.094 --> 24:34.306
Brilliant and dangerous in so many ways.

24:36.850 --> 24:39.394
He was the Leonardo da Vinci of Australia.

24:43.565 --> 24:48.278
Only three years of formal education,
nine years old to twelve years old.

24:49.779 --> 24:52.115
So he wasn't restricted in his thinking.

24:54.659 --> 24:56.786
That was his strength, as it turns out.

24:57.787 --> 25:00.874
Ben's one
of these really unique people in the world

25:00.957 --> 25:05.629
who comes from an incredible background
of hardly any formal schooling at all.

25:07.297 --> 25:10.884
He was almost a street person in a way.

25:13.136 --> 25:14.346
Benny would just arrive

25:14.429 --> 25:18.767
and stay with us
for two nights, two weeks,

25:19.559 --> 25:22.354
and he was physically very awkward.

25:22.437 --> 25:27.651
He had a very severe tic,
but he was curious.

25:27.734 --> 25:30.779
He was a passionately curious man.

25:31.738 --> 25:36.868
And we've moved the rig slightly, so, uh…
The boat feels really nice.

25:36.952 --> 25:41.581
His genius was
to be able to absorb information.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.459
He's like a honeyeater.

25:44.543 --> 25:47.712
He'd just pick, pick, pick, pick, pick,
pick, pick, pick and bring all this in.

25:48.922 --> 25:51.841
So when Benny started to design the yacht,

25:51.925 --> 25:56.096
I was sitting on the dock,
and he said, "John, look at the seagulls."

25:57.097 --> 26:00.517
He said, "Every feather,
there's a flight control system."

26:01.268 --> 26:03.770
He said, "There must be
a thousand control systems

26:03.853 --> 26:05.772
in one wing of that bird."

26:07.148 --> 26:10.819
He said, "Look at how they take off.
It's just one flip and they're gone."

26:12.320 --> 26:13.446
"It's beautiful."

26:15.490 --> 26:17.492
He was a student of nature.

26:19.160 --> 26:22.247
And I had very little understanding
of where it could lead,

26:22.956 --> 26:24.499
but the door was opened.

26:28.253 --> 26:32.632
Benny had gone across to Holland
to try and design a 12 Metre

26:32.716 --> 26:35.302
that was gonna be better
than the 12 Metre that we had in 1980.

26:36.678 --> 26:39.973
Benny was at one of the biggest
towing tank facilities in the world

26:40.056 --> 26:43.059
trying to get another one hundredth
of one knot out of the boat.

26:44.603 --> 26:48.315
He was tearing his hair out trying to find
an improvement, and he just couldn't.

26:49.107 --> 26:51.151
He was enormously frustrated,

26:52.777 --> 26:56.239
and suddenly
we started getting these telexes…

26:59.367 --> 27:02.370
where he said,
"Hang on. We're onto something here."

27:05.582 --> 27:08.835
Every day we'd get back to the office
and there'd be another telex

27:08.918 --> 27:11.588
with him getting more and more excited.

27:13.048 --> 27:17.886
He said, "I'm developing a keel here
that could potentially be a breakthrough."

27:21.097 --> 27:22.807
But he didn't actually tell us
what it was.

27:24.225 --> 27:26.936
<i>Lexcen's seven models</i>
<i>underwent test trials</i>

27:27.020 --> 27:30.357
<i>in minute detail in at least 200 runs,</i>

27:30.440 --> 27:34.194
<i>which allowed the designer to make</i>
<i>constant refinements to his secret keel.</i>

27:35.737 --> 27:39.199
So the call came through
to come across to see this model

27:39.282 --> 27:41.451
that he created
with this funny-looking keel.

27:43.912 --> 27:47.415
So, I knew there was
something special going on with the keel.

27:47.499 --> 27:51.294
Benny said, "Okay, you can come over,
but you can't tell anyone."

27:51.378 --> 27:55.173
It was under covers, and John Bertrand
took me in to have a look.

27:55.674 --> 27:59.469
There, sitting in the foundry
on the sand, was this thing.

28:02.639 --> 28:04.516
And I think I was speechless.

28:05.725 --> 28:07.310
Just trying to take it all in.

28:07.394 --> 28:10.855
I'm looking at this thing going,
"You can't be serious."

28:10.939 --> 28:15.527
I didn't know what to think
because it looked a bit weird.

28:17.070 --> 28:20.156
People have been designing
12 Metres since 1905.

28:21.491 --> 28:22.701
This is so different.

28:24.119 --> 28:25.495
How can it be right?

28:25.578 --> 28:28.248
I knew that the keel was inverted.

28:28.331 --> 28:29.749
It was upside down.

28:42.262 --> 28:46.015
It was like someone designed a new car.
Looked like it's got wheels on the roof.

28:49.269 --> 28:53.857
It became clear
Benny had been playing around with wings.

28:53.940 --> 28:56.860
It's like a bird with wings on it. Okay?

28:59.487 --> 29:01.990
And that became
the outrageous winged keel.

29:04.325 --> 29:06.411
We knew the boat was high risk.

29:07.537 --> 29:11.708
And John, who's technically
one of the great sailors,

29:11.791 --> 29:13.209
was a little nervous about it.

29:13.293 --> 29:14.711
The last thing I wanted to do

29:14.794 --> 29:17.672
is to spend a huge amount
of my time, effort, and emotion

29:17.756 --> 29:20.425
on something where the equipment
was never gonna cut it.

29:20.925 --> 29:22.886
We didn't even know
it was gonna sail like a yacht.

29:24.387 --> 29:29.058
When I showed our boat,
they all thought I'd gone off my rocker.

29:29.142 --> 29:32.562
So we decided we were going to have
a big meeting with Alan Bond.

29:34.189 --> 29:38.985
"So, Alan, Benny's come up
with a boat that is very, very different."

29:39.068 --> 29:43.615
"But the tank says it's 20 minutes faster
around the track than this one."

29:43.698 --> 29:46.868
"What are we going to do?"
And Alan said, "Right."

29:47.619 --> 29:50.830
"Well, we're gonna build that one.
Otherwise, you're all fired."

29:50.914 --> 29:53.625
So we just went ahead and built that boat.

30:03.218 --> 30:06.095
This is where
Ben Lexcen's latest winged wonder

30:06.179 --> 30:11.100
will have its fiery birth in a vat
of molten lead in North Fremantle.

30:12.685 --> 30:15.396
So many years
of getting hammered by the Americans.

30:15.480 --> 30:18.775
It was time
that we had to do something radical.

30:24.280 --> 30:26.574
Skippy and I were involved
in building the boat.

30:27.158 --> 30:28.868
You know, literally hands-on.

30:34.165 --> 30:38.211
Everyone was covered in gray
from grinding and cutting aluminum.

30:44.092 --> 30:47.178
Benny Lexcen and I
designed the deck layout together.

30:48.513 --> 30:51.099
And I was in charge of everything
from the deck up.

30:52.433 --> 30:56.479
We actually threw the rule book out
in terms of how sails will be made.

30:58.064 --> 31:01.901
And we developed the software
to design the sails.

31:04.737 --> 31:06.114
Totally revolutionary.

31:07.615 --> 31:10.285
We would take risks
and broke a lot of stuff

31:10.368 --> 31:13.663
because Benny was experimenting
as he was building stuff.

31:13.746 --> 31:15.373
That's how he was, you know.

31:16.207 --> 31:18.334
You'd say, "Well, that guy's crazy."

31:18.418 --> 31:22.422
Well, yes, he was, but we're all crazy.
It's all part of the deal.

31:22.505 --> 31:25.300
<i>We sat down with designer Ben Lexcen</i>

31:25.383 --> 31:28.761
<i>and talked about his partnership</i>
<i>with team owner Alan Bond.</i>

31:28.845 --> 31:32.599
I'm not under any pressure
of time or money,

31:32.682 --> 31:35.852
and he appreciates my style of thinking,

31:35.935 --> 31:39.689
and he more or less lets me
just wander along like I'm an inventor.

31:43.902 --> 31:47.113
Alan Bond's new 12 Metre
was officially named in the ceremony

31:47.196 --> 31:49.741
before thousands of spectators
in Perth today.

31:50.366 --> 31:52.368
<i>A supremely confident Alan Bond</i>

31:52.452 --> 31:53.536
<i>told a news conference today</i>

31:53.620 --> 31:55.955
<i>that Australia II would win</i>
<i>the America's Cup.</i>

31:57.123 --> 32:02.587
The construction of this yacht
first began with Ben Lexcen, the designer.

32:03.546 --> 32:08.426
We've worked over two years
on a truly Australian effort.

32:08.509 --> 32:10.094
For the first time,

32:10.178 --> 32:15.016
we have been able to develop
equal to anything else the world will see.

32:22.315 --> 32:24.734
Three cheers… Hip-hip hooray!

32:37.580 --> 32:40.375
Four minutes before00
on Newport Radio WADK,

32:40.458 --> 32:44.003
the official radio station
of the 1983 America's Cup.

32:44.087 --> 32:45.380
Speaking of which,

32:45.463 --> 32:47.298
the successful 1980 defender,
Dennis Conner,

32:47.382 --> 32:48.883
and Liberty, a brand-new 12,

32:48.967 --> 32:51.594
has made her arrival
in Newport Harbor today.

32:54.263 --> 32:57.433
<i> Dennis Conner,</i>
<i>the incumbent America's Cup defender,</i>

32:57.517 --> 33:02.188
<i>a solitary man with a single focus,</i>
<i>to win again in 1983.</i>

33:03.773 --> 33:06.651
On behalf of AT&T,
we're proud to, uh, be a sponsor

33:06.734 --> 33:08.194
in defense of the America's Cup.

33:08.277 --> 33:11.030
And let me just add one other thing.
Go get 'em, Dennis!

33:11.114 --> 33:12.782
-All right!
-Tomorrow!

33:13.449 --> 33:16.077
This Tuesday,
they will begin running the competition

33:16.160 --> 33:19.414
for the most coveted sailing prize,
the America's Cup.

33:20.957 --> 33:24.085
Now, the America's Cup
is a Challenger Series,

33:25.086 --> 33:27.588
52 races against all the other countries,

33:28.297 --> 33:30.299
four-and-a-half months in Newport,

33:31.467 --> 33:34.846
for the right to race
against the Americans in September.

33:37.765 --> 33:39.392
There was a time here in New England

33:39.475 --> 33:42.478
when the words "The British are coming"
rang out loud and clear.

33:42.562 --> 33:45.815
But during this summer of 1983
here in Newport,

33:45.898 --> 33:47.608
it's not only the British who are coming,

33:47.692 --> 33:51.320
but it's also the French,
the Canadians, the Italians,

33:51.404 --> 33:52.655
and the Australians.

33:56.534 --> 33:59.704
When we first got to Newport
for the Challenger Races,

34:00.413 --> 34:01.664
we talked about the keel.

34:02.623 --> 34:04.959
And we decided we'd hide it completely.

34:07.462 --> 34:10.923
The last thing we want to do
is show the keel to the world,

34:11.007 --> 34:13.634
so that someone else could copy it,
and put it on their boat,

34:13.718 --> 34:15.636
and be as competitive as what we were.

34:16.929 --> 34:18.890
So, we kept it hidden.

34:20.308 --> 34:22.977
And I remember
there was a local newspaper.

34:23.061 --> 34:26.731
It said, "The Australians have come
with some bizarre, stupid keel."

34:27.482 --> 34:29.567
"These guys have finally lost it."

34:29.650 --> 34:31.861
"They've lost three times,
and they're getting desperate."

34:31.944 --> 34:33.237
That was the attitude of it.

34:37.575 --> 34:40.369
Starting leg of the America's Cup course
is into the wind,

34:40.453 --> 34:45.374
four-and-a-half miles long to this mark,
followed by two reaching legs.

34:45.458 --> 34:48.169
Then the yachts turn
one more time to the port,

34:48.252 --> 34:50.880
finishing once more into the wind.

34:50.963 --> 34:52.548
So we entered the first races

34:52.632 --> 34:55.468
of the elimination series
against the Italians,

34:55.551 --> 34:59.222
with the unknown
of just how competitive our package was.

35:00.223 --> 35:01.849
This radical boat,

35:01.933 --> 35:04.352
you're either gonna hit a home run
or you're not.

35:04.435 --> 35:07.522
We were either going to be
heroes or idiots.

35:07.605 --> 35:13.694
-<i> Five, four, three, two, one</i>.

35:15.822 --> 35:17.740
<i>Australia has turned the mark</i>

35:17.824 --> 35:20.159
<i>and is absolutely flying downwind.</i>

35:20.243 --> 35:22.328
All the work that we had done in Australia

35:22.411 --> 35:24.122
had paid huge dividends.

35:24.205 --> 35:26.415
<i> Australia II has won.</i>

35:26.499 --> 35:29.794
<i>You can see Australia II.</i>
<i>She's just crossed the finishing line.</i>

35:29.877 --> 35:31.921
And we came out all guns blazing.

35:33.464 --> 35:36.467
We were no longer overawed by Newport.

35:36.551 --> 35:39.846
We were just angry.
We were there for one reason, to win.

35:40.513 --> 35:43.182
The time is30 a.m. on a Sunday morning,

35:43.266 --> 35:45.935
and the Australia II crew
is already hard at work.

35:48.938 --> 35:51.983
We would run,
we'd do weights, we'd do aerobics.

35:52.066 --> 35:55.736
It was not only
a part of getting fit and getting strong.

35:55.820 --> 35:58.114
It was also about sending a message.

35:58.197 --> 36:00.616
Good morning, Australia!

36:01.534 --> 36:04.453
Now it was only until
we started to win races

36:05.037 --> 36:06.622
that our credibility increased.

36:07.957 --> 36:09.917
In the America's Cup preliminaries,

36:10.001 --> 36:12.461
all signs are pointing
to Alan Bond's Australia II

36:12.545 --> 36:13.838
as the boat to beat.

36:14.547 --> 36:17.508
We beat the Italians,
crushed the Canadians.

36:18.759 --> 36:20.136
After today's race,

36:20.219 --> 36:23.639
it seems nothing can tack faster
or point higher into the wind

36:23.723 --> 36:25.766
than Ben Lexcen's radical 12 Metre.

36:25.850 --> 36:28.811
While few people
have actually seen this mysterious keel,

36:28.895 --> 36:32.315
almost everyone here
has seen the boat racing and winning.

36:32.398 --> 36:34.442
<i> Australia II, by some…</i>

36:34.525 --> 36:38.321
Then, suddenly,
"Why are they so competitive?"

36:40.364 --> 36:43.993
<i>What is that beneath the hull</i>
<i>of the Australia II?</i>

36:44.076 --> 36:46.996
<i>A keel, but what kind of a keel?</i>

36:47.079 --> 36:49.832
<i>It's this summer's mystery at Newport.</i>

36:50.374 --> 36:53.044
The boat was covered.
It was always secret.

36:53.544 --> 36:57.548
And that started to drive
some of the observers crazy.

36:57.632 --> 37:00.051
The big question here, Bryant,
this morning, is

37:00.134 --> 37:01.719
what do the Aussies have on their bottom?

37:01.802 --> 37:04.472
Between us, can you tell me
what that keel is?

37:04.555 --> 37:07.433
Between us, Mort, I can't tell you, no.

37:08.017 --> 37:10.770
<i>Armed guards</i>
<i>patrol this place around the clock.</i>

37:10.853 --> 37:13.105
<i>Their job is to protect Australia II,</i>

37:13.189 --> 37:16.609
<i>the yacht that may very well succeed</i>
<i>in making sporting history.</i>

37:18.361 --> 37:20.404
<i>Australia's designer, Ben Lexcen,</i>

37:20.488 --> 37:23.282
<i>he's something</i>
<i>of a reluctant superstar here,</i>

37:23.950 --> 37:26.244
<i>but they all want to know about his keel.</i>

37:26.327 --> 37:28.871
-Let's see the keel!
-Where's the keel, Benny?

37:28.955 --> 37:32.792
Ben Lexcen decided that he'd draw up
a sketch of the winged keel,

37:33.376 --> 37:36.462
and he made it totally different
than what it really was.

37:36.963 --> 37:40.258
The office at Newport Offshore
had a photocopier,

37:40.341 --> 37:44.262
so Ben went over with this sheet of paper
and put it on their photocopier.

37:45.930 --> 37:49.976
Comes flying back into the office
ten minutes later and says, "Guys!"

37:50.059 --> 37:53.771
"I've left… I've left a drawing of my keel
in your photocopier.<i>"</i>

37:53.854 --> 37:58.818
By that afternoon, there were copies
all over Newport of our fake keel.

38:00.778 --> 38:04.782
Then opposition boats put winglets
on the bottom of their keels.

38:04.865 --> 38:07.451
<i>Australia's keel has so impressed everyone</i>

38:07.535 --> 38:10.413
<i>that the British have put wings</i>
<i>on the keel of Victory.</i>

38:10.496 --> 38:14.208
We'd go around and check them and say,
"No, it's little a bit different to that."

38:14.292 --> 38:17.044
"You gotta try and do it this way."
You know?

38:18.462 --> 38:21.799
One of the Americans drew that
and says there's their design.

38:21.882 --> 38:23.134
That's their secret keel.

38:23.217 --> 38:25.553
Is that it? What do you think? Is that…

38:26.429 --> 38:27.722
Could be. Could be.

38:29.181 --> 38:31.100
<i> Australia II has won!</i>

38:31.183 --> 38:36.147
The West Australians now have
an incredible 45 wins from 51 starts,

38:36.230 --> 38:39.942
and that just happens to be
the best record in 12 Metre history.

38:41.777 --> 38:44.572
And in the end,
we won the Challenger Series.

38:44.655 --> 38:45.781
We won by a lot.

38:46.657 --> 38:49.994
And so that's the boat race
and the Challenge Series.

38:50.077 --> 38:54.206
Australia goes on to race Liberty
for the America's Cup.

39:06.594 --> 39:09.138
The Australians are
the official 25th challengers

39:09.221 --> 39:10.723
for the America's Cup,

39:10.806 --> 39:12.600
and their incredible winning record

39:12.683 --> 39:15.061
really has
the New York Yacht Club worried.

39:16.771 --> 39:18.689
<i>The man</i>
<i>who won the Cup last time</i>

39:18.773 --> 39:20.733
<i>for the United States is jittery.</i>

39:21.275 --> 39:24.653
We don't know much about their boat.
It's obviously a different, uh, type

39:24.737 --> 39:27.865
of, uh, characteristics
than a standard 12 Metre.

39:27.948 --> 39:30.826
It tacks differently,
and it, uh, accelerates differently,

39:30.910 --> 39:33.412
and it maneuvers differently
at the starts.

39:35.247 --> 39:39.251
The New York Yacht Club saw
that our race record was really strong.

39:39.335 --> 39:40.753
-Hi.
-Two minutes for a--

39:40.836 --> 39:43.005
-No. Sorry.
-Not even two minutes?

39:43.089 --> 39:46.008
We're late for a meeting here,
so we gotta move on.

39:46.092 --> 39:47.093
Thank you anyway.

39:48.052 --> 39:49.887
And if these Aussies are beating up

39:49.970 --> 39:51.889
on the foreign challengers so easily,

39:51.972 --> 39:54.558
47 wins out of 55 races,

39:54.642 --> 39:56.435
then that starts to cut deep.

39:57.478 --> 39:59.939
That sent shock waves
through the New York Yacht Club.

40:00.564 --> 40:02.691
Clearly shock waves through Newport.

40:03.526 --> 40:05.569
There's a serious side to this.

40:05.653 --> 40:08.072
Obviously there's more
than just a yachting race at stake.

40:08.155 --> 40:09.532
There's also a lot of money.

40:09.615 --> 40:13.744
It's estimated that £100 million are spent
in and around Newport

40:13.828 --> 40:15.204
during the America's Cup.

40:15.287 --> 40:18.916
It was a sudden realization
that they could lose this golden goose.

40:18.999 --> 40:20.501
It could really happen.

40:20.584 --> 40:22.878
People in Newport
and Rhode Island knew all the time,

40:22.962 --> 40:24.880
but kept it a very closely guarded secret

40:24.964 --> 40:27.133
that the prize
isn't so much a sailboat race.

40:27.216 --> 40:30.386
It's about a billion-dollar industry
that goes along with the Cup.

40:31.387 --> 40:33.222
<i> So if the Americans lose,</i>

40:33.305 --> 40:37.268
<i>then a substantial amount of that</i>
<i>might be spent in Western Australia.</i>

40:38.519 --> 40:40.438
So, for the New York Yacht Club,

40:40.938 --> 40:42.648
the consequences of losing

40:43.774 --> 40:44.984
are enormous.

40:48.237 --> 40:51.490
<i> An ABC News Brief</i>
<i>brought to you by Apple Computer.</i>

40:51.574 --> 40:54.160
<i>Now from Los Angeles,</i>
<i>here's Peter Jennings.</i>

40:54.243 --> 40:57.371
The America's Cup competition
is set to get underway this Thursday.

40:57.455 --> 40:58.706
There is now a dispute, however,

40:58.789 --> 41:01.333
between the New York Yacht Club
and the Australians.

41:01.417 --> 41:04.336
It seems the Americans are upset
with something the Aussies have done

41:04.420 --> 41:06.297
with the underside of their boat,

41:06.380 --> 41:09.800
something the Americans feel
will give the Aussies an unfair advantage.

41:09.884 --> 41:11.760
The New York Yacht Club alleges

41:11.844 --> 41:14.430
that Australia II's winged keel
is illegal.

41:15.139 --> 41:16.765
This four-million-dollar challenge,

41:16.849 --> 41:18.767
the closest ever
in the history of the Cup,

41:18.851 --> 41:19.685
could be scuttled.

41:20.352 --> 41:22.855
The New York Yacht Club,
they wanted to ban us.

41:23.355 --> 41:26.025
They said there is no way
that Benny could've come up with this.

41:26.108 --> 41:28.861
It had to have been designed
by other people.

41:30.488 --> 41:34.658
People couldn't believe
that he could do it,

41:34.742 --> 41:37.036
given his education and his background.

41:37.119 --> 41:39.622
<i>At the center of all the fuss this year</i>

41:39.705 --> 41:41.290
<i>has been barefoot Ben Lexcen.</i>

41:41.790 --> 41:43.459
<i>With three years' schooling,</i>

41:43.542 --> 41:47.796
<i>he's the man who has designed,</i>
<i>arguably, the fastest 12 Metre ever.</i>

41:49.507 --> 41:51.258
I didn't know much about Ben Lexcen.

41:52.593 --> 41:53.677
But people talk.

41:54.303 --> 41:55.888
You hear through the grapevine.

41:56.430 --> 42:00.100
Who's to say these wings,
whose idea these really were?

42:00.184 --> 42:04.897
<i> The Americans try and confirm</i>
<i>that Lexcen was helped by Dutch designers.</i>

42:05.898 --> 42:09.026
We believe Lexcen used the idea
from Amsterdam,

42:09.652 --> 42:14.323
but the rules are it had to be designed
by the country of the challenge.

42:14.406 --> 42:16.992
The New York Yacht Club
believe they have grounds to say

42:17.076 --> 42:19.662
that I didn't design the boat
totally by myself.

42:19.745 --> 42:23.832
They go behind your back
and try and get evidence in dubious ways.

42:25.918 --> 42:27.878
This afternoon, Ben was suffering

42:27.962 --> 42:30.506
what friends said
were a couple of dizzy spells.

42:31.257 --> 42:33.968
Doctors immediately put him
into intensive care.

42:35.135 --> 42:37.555
His friends say
it's the attacks against his name

42:37.638 --> 42:38.973
that helped put him there.

42:40.683 --> 42:42.643
The New York Yacht Club were endeavoring

42:42.726 --> 42:44.728
to get the design assistants in Holland

42:45.396 --> 42:48.983
to say that they designed the keel
and not Ben Lexcen.

42:49.066 --> 42:52.111
The Dutch had designed the keel
and not Ben Lexcen.

42:52.194 --> 42:54.863
We felt responsible to go over,

42:54.947 --> 42:57.408
to send someone to Holland
to really investigate it.

42:58.450 --> 43:01.328
<i> The director of the Netherlands</i>
<i>Ship Model Basin has charged</i>

43:01.412 --> 43:05.791
<i>that members of the New York Yacht Club</i>
<i>tried to get him to sign a false affidavit</i>

43:05.874 --> 43:08.544
<i>stating Ben Lexcen was not the designer.</i>

43:09.378 --> 43:12.131
<i> I was very surprised</i>
<i>to come face-to-face with two people</i>

43:12.214 --> 43:14.466
<i>who wanted me to sign a document</i>

43:14.550 --> 43:18.387
<i>which said that I was the designer</i>
<i>of Australia II rather than Ben Lexcen,</i>

43:18.470 --> 43:21.348
<i>which is almost too ridiculous</i>
<i>to even think of.</i>

43:22.850 --> 43:26.395
The keel cup committee said,
"We've been over to Holland,

43:27.229 --> 43:30.899
and there was no substance
to their complaint."

43:31.483 --> 43:33.611
"This boat is fair and legal."

43:34.278 --> 43:36.780
And that was the thing
that finally busted their case apart.

43:37.406 --> 43:40.492
The New York Yacht Club
today withdrew its objections

43:40.576 --> 43:43.495
to the mysterious winged keel
on Australia II

43:43.579 --> 43:46.790
and said, "May the better yacht
win the America's Cup."

43:46.874 --> 43:51.712
It has been 56 races
and nearly two and a half years of effort

43:51.795 --> 43:54.798
been put in to reach where we are today.

43:54.882 --> 44:00.137
Let the best yacht and crew decide
by the gun at the end of each race.

44:07.811 --> 44:11.523
<i> We're about to go live by satellite</i>
<i>to Newport. Rob Mundle, are you there?</i>

44:11.607 --> 44:13.233
Certainly. Good morning, Harry.

44:13.317 --> 44:15.152
We have a great battle coming up.

44:15.235 --> 44:19.198
The showdown, 132 years
of sporting history at stake here.

44:19.281 --> 44:21.867
We're looking at Dennis Conner
on the screen right there.

44:22.368 --> 44:23.494
I was uneasy.

44:24.244 --> 44:27.414
Bertrand, he was at the top of his game.

44:28.248 --> 44:30.042
He was a tough competitor,

44:30.125 --> 44:32.378
and he had a very good boat
and a good crew.

44:32.461 --> 44:34.630
He was dangerous, and he scared me.

44:36.382 --> 44:38.884
Liberty and Australia II
have entered the race course.

44:38.967 --> 44:41.762
According to my watch,
nine minutes and 30 seconds from now,

44:41.845 --> 44:43.555
they will cross the starting line.

44:44.056 --> 44:47.017
Ten minutes
before the start of the race gun,

44:47.101 --> 44:48.852
that's when the two boats would meet,

44:49.728 --> 44:51.313
positioning yourself,

44:51.397 --> 44:54.066
and that's when it'd be on.
The gloves would come off.

44:55.275 --> 44:58.946
The yacht that had got
to the first mark of the first race

44:59.029 --> 45:00.989
had always won the America's Cup.

45:05.869 --> 45:08.580
Australia over the line first
by three seconds.

45:09.206 --> 45:11.542
And I look behind,
and Dennis is right on our hammer,

45:11.625 --> 45:12.835
right on our hammer.

45:16.130 --> 45:18.757
<i> The two yachts</i>
<i>are now approaching the first marker,</i>

45:18.841 --> 45:20.801
<i>and it's good news for Australia.</i>

45:21.468 --> 45:23.887
We just beat them
by a couple of boat lengths.

45:23.971 --> 45:25.431
One to us.

45:25.514 --> 45:28.142
Australia has just made history.

45:28.225 --> 45:31.186
The foreign challenger
has never reached the first mark

45:31.270 --> 45:34.940
ahead of the American boat
in the first race.

45:35.023 --> 45:37.192
Australia has just done it.

45:38.193 --> 45:40.946
After the start,
we sailed away from Liberty.

45:42.990 --> 45:46.034
Then all of a sudden,
it was like an explosion.

45:53.167 --> 45:55.002
We had no control at all.

45:55.627 --> 45:59.089
The wheel just went light.
No steering. Just rudderless.

46:03.719 --> 46:07.514
It was weird. We just had
a fitting pull off the side of the boat

46:07.598 --> 46:10.100
that had been there forever, you know.

46:10.893 --> 46:13.312
And Dennis passed around us.

46:14.605 --> 46:15.814
The race was over.

46:17.483 --> 46:19.109
<i> Liberty wins.</i>

46:19.193 --> 46:22.362
<i>Sounds like a World War I poster,</i>
<i>but it is instead the headline</i>

46:22.446 --> 46:24.865
<i>out of today's opening round</i>
<i>of the America's Cup.</i>

46:26.450 --> 46:29.453
We went across his stern,
and the damn rudder broke.

46:32.998 --> 46:35.250
And then, of course,
start of the second race,

46:35.334 --> 46:39.546
bang, one of the tangs holding
the headboard of the mainsail breaks.

46:40.339 --> 46:42.382
All summer their boat
broke down just once,

46:42.466 --> 46:45.677
and now in the finals,
two races and two breakdowns.

46:45.761 --> 46:48.430
This has meant a lot to the Liberty crew,
giving them momentum

46:48.514 --> 46:51.225
and an awful lot of confidence
heading into race three.

46:52.059 --> 46:55.479
Commodore McCullough,
what would you say the odds are right now?

46:55.562 --> 46:59.817
I think we'll win it 4-0, but I'll take
four-to-one as a safety factor.

47:01.109 --> 47:02.444
Any further questions?

47:02.528 --> 47:05.614
For something like that to happen
two races in a row,

47:06.156 --> 47:07.991
it's just unforgivable.

47:08.075 --> 47:09.451
Benny, give me a break,

47:09.535 --> 47:12.621
just give me something
that'll allow us to play the game here.

47:13.789 --> 47:15.249
When we had that breakage,

47:15.332 --> 47:18.377
there was some tension
with John Bertrand and Ben Lexcen.

47:18.460 --> 47:20.838
And I remember John saying to him,

47:20.921 --> 47:24.925
"Go through the boat from head to toe
and just check everything."

47:26.844 --> 47:28.512
They have now gone over the yacht

47:28.595 --> 47:31.348
from bow to stern,
from masthead to keel bolt,

47:31.431 --> 47:34.142
checking every sail,
every piece of equipment.

47:36.436 --> 47:39.606
Race three, Benny didn't attend
the launching of the boat.

47:39.690 --> 47:41.775
He was actually on a hill with binoculars

47:43.026 --> 47:44.570
under intense pressure.

47:44.653 --> 47:48.323
With just about seven minutes to go now
to get this race underway.

47:49.283 --> 47:51.034
<i>You are watching Australia II,</i>

47:51.118 --> 47:54.204
<i>the 12 Metre that has set</i>
<i>the yachting world on its ear.</i>

47:54.955 --> 47:57.249
<i> Three, two, one.</i>

48:03.297 --> 48:05.757
<i>Australia II has just passed Liberty</i>

48:05.841 --> 48:08.427
<i>and is taking off down the course.</i>

48:09.011 --> 48:14.224
But as it turns out,
it was Benny's dream in its finest hour.

48:19.021 --> 48:22.024
<i> We have just reached</i>
<i>the three-hour mark of this race,</i>

48:22.107 --> 48:24.985
<i>and the winds here in Newport</i>
<i>are starting to pick up.</i>

48:26.320 --> 48:30.490
Quite often in Newport,
the wind speed was very strong,

48:31.074 --> 48:35.621
and the winged keel effectively lowered
the center of gravity of the yacht

48:35.704 --> 48:39.041
and made Australia II competitive
in stronger breezes.

48:39.750 --> 48:42.377
This concept, upwind,
the boat was a rocket ship.

48:42.461 --> 48:44.546
She was seriously fast.

48:48.550 --> 48:50.177
<i>Australia sailed across the line</i>

48:50.260 --> 48:53.555
<i>to win the third race</i>
<i>by three minutes and 14 seconds.</i>

48:54.306 --> 48:57.309
<i>Since 12 Metre started racing</i>
<i>for the America's Cup,</i>

48:57.392 --> 49:00.354
<i>that's the biggest margin</i>
<i>ever recorded by a challenger.</i>

49:01.605 --> 49:03.899
<i>Australia II is exceptionally fast.</i>

49:03.982 --> 49:06.944
<i>This is what the New York Yacht Club</i>
<i>is afraid of.</i>

49:08.403 --> 49:11.657
The New York Yacht Club
certainly didn't have any enthusiasm

49:11.740 --> 49:13.116
from my performance.

49:14.034 --> 49:16.745
Is the New York Yacht Club
at all embarrassed about this?

49:16.828 --> 49:18.664
We keep the pressure on the skippers

49:18.747 --> 49:22.084
because we say their head replaces
the Cup in the New York Yacht Club,

49:22.167 --> 49:25.128
so we keep pressure
on them all the time.

49:26.213 --> 49:28.757
But I came in
after losing that race,

49:28.840 --> 49:31.385
I wasn't ready
just to lay down and quit. No.

49:31.885 --> 49:36.098
The biggest thing to me was the attitude.
Attitude, attitude, attitude.

49:37.265 --> 49:38.600
Tired of the bullshit.

49:44.064 --> 49:46.692
Tired of wasting four hours
every morning fucking around

49:46.775 --> 49:49.069
for something
that's not gonna help us win the Cup.

49:49.695 --> 49:52.906
All I was focused on
was being the best I could be.

49:52.990 --> 49:54.658
No excuse to lose.

49:57.077 --> 49:58.078
<i>Look at this.</i>

49:58.161 --> 50:00.288
<i>The boat at the top</i>
<i>of the screen is Liberty.</i>

50:00.372 --> 50:02.916
<i>Six seconds ahead of Australia</i>
<i>when the gun fired.</i>

50:04.418 --> 50:06.336
<i>Liberty went around the first mark</i>

50:06.420 --> 50:07.879
<i>36 seconds ahead.</i>

50:09.089 --> 50:11.299
Dennis Conner was unstoppable.

50:13.260 --> 50:16.304
He was the most cunning
and clever on the water

50:16.388 --> 50:18.890
and strategically made good moves.

50:18.974 --> 50:21.184
<i>We get into a classic tacking duel.</i>

50:21.268 --> 50:25.564
He was impossible to go around,
always covering tack for tack.

50:27.899 --> 50:30.986
And he was hitting the wind shifts
at the right time,

50:31.778 --> 50:32.988
massive wind shifts.

50:34.156 --> 50:38.118
<i> Liberty led Australia</i>
<i>across the finish line by 43 seconds.</i>

50:38.201 --> 50:39.411
<i> There she goes.</i>

50:39.494 --> 50:42.622
<i>She's shooting it.</i>
<i>There's the gun. This race is over.</i>

50:42.706 --> 50:44.624
<i>The Americans lead three to one.</i>

50:45.459 --> 50:46.376
I kicked butt.

50:48.253 --> 50:51.214
The American yacht Liberty
tonight is just one victory away

50:51.298 --> 50:53.717
from keeping the America's Cup
in the United States.

50:53.800 --> 50:55.469
Three to one in the America's Cup series.

50:55.552 --> 50:57.054
One more win for Liberty,

50:57.137 --> 51:01.266
and the America's Cup will stay
bolted down at the New York Yacht Club.

51:03.810 --> 51:06.229
<i> The despondent Australians</i>
<i>return to their dock,</i>

51:06.313 --> 51:07.814
<i>knowing they're down 3-1.</i>

51:07.898 --> 51:10.400
<i>They cannot afford</i>
<i>to make any more errors.</i>

51:12.027 --> 51:16.114
At 3-1 in Newport,
the champagne was on ice,

51:16.698 --> 51:19.409
the banners were ready to go up.

51:19.493 --> 51:21.244
"Congratulations, Dennis and team."

51:25.040 --> 51:27.417
And Newport was about to celebrate.

51:30.378 --> 51:33.507
It's all over. Absolutely. It's all over.

51:34.007 --> 51:35.550
Newport was rocking.

51:35.634 --> 51:40.222
They just couldn't have been happier
to have another thrashing.

51:43.058 --> 51:45.769
It was just demoralizing.

51:48.980 --> 51:53.693
On the morning of the race,
I remember the breakfast was subdued.

51:55.862 --> 51:58.365
I had a hard time
even smelling the bacon and eggs,

51:58.448 --> 51:59.449
let alone eating anything.

52:02.285 --> 52:05.372
But then, on the television,
we received a note

52:05.455 --> 52:07.582
from the Prime Minister of Australia,
Bob Hawke.

52:07.666 --> 52:11.253
<i>Congratulations, you've done</i>
<i>a magnificent job to this point.</i>

52:11.336 --> 52:15.090
<i>What you've shown in relation</i>
<i>to our technological capacity,</i>

52:15.173 --> 52:18.093
<i>our determination as individuals…</i>

52:18.176 --> 52:21.179
<i>You've got</i>
<i>the entire support of Australia.</i>

52:21.263 --> 52:23.181
<i>We'll all be looking forward</i>
<i>to your return</i>

52:23.265 --> 52:26.184
<i>when we will do you as proud</i>
<i>as you have done us.</i>

52:28.019 --> 52:30.605
Bob Hawke, Prime Minister of Australia,

52:30.689 --> 52:32.107
shit, that's a big deal.

52:33.275 --> 52:36.820
Here we were being recognized
by the prime minister of our nation.

52:37.737 --> 52:39.573
It was a total game changer.

52:44.911 --> 52:49.958
Armies over the last thousand years
have gone to war with symbols and music.

52:52.252 --> 52:55.088
So, the boxing kangaroo flag was raised.

52:56.464 --> 52:59.885
And we chose a battle hymn,
Men at Work, "Down Under."

53:00.635 --> 53:02.846
And the team spirit came alive.

53:13.023 --> 53:17.027
<i> And so almost unbelievably,</i>
<i>that's Australia ahead at the first mark.</i>

53:18.987 --> 53:22.115
Off the coast of Rhode Island,
it was Australia's day.

53:26.119 --> 53:29.664
And Australia II still is alive
and in the America's Cup yacht race.

53:41.009 --> 53:44.763
We're just gonna get out there and do it
twice more, get this Cup for Australia.

53:48.934 --> 53:51.645
At three to two,
the tables were turning.

53:51.728 --> 53:54.689
Television crews were coming in
from all around the world.

53:55.190 --> 53:57.525
Australians were flying in to Newport.

54:00.654 --> 54:03.740
Tonight, that quaint coastal resort
of Newport, Rhode Island,

54:03.823 --> 54:06.701
is under the constant barrage
of Australia II.

54:08.995 --> 54:12.165
The whole of Newport knew
that the Australians were in town.

54:12.249 --> 54:15.252
We tore the place apart.

54:18.463 --> 54:22.717
<i> The Aussies certainly have joined</i>
<i>the hype and hoopla here with gusto,</i>

54:22.801 --> 54:25.637
<i>promoting their souvenirs</i>
<i>and image aggressively.</i>

54:33.770 --> 54:35.730
The barbarians are at the gate.

54:36.314 --> 54:39.025
The Australians have come
for the sacred Cup,

54:39.109 --> 54:40.443
and they're howling.

54:41.569 --> 54:47.075
What Australians really like
is upsetting the upper echelon.

54:59.504 --> 55:02.048
In race six, we were sailing the boat
extremely well.

55:02.132 --> 55:03.383
The boat was a rocket ship.

55:04.884 --> 55:10.682
It's Australia II with a very big lead
here by some two minutes, it seems.

55:11.266 --> 55:14.060
And we won that race
by three and a half minutes.

55:14.144 --> 55:15.562
It was the greatest win

55:15.645 --> 55:18.440
by a challenging yacht
in the 12 Metre era.

55:21.318 --> 55:24.863
In 132 years, no challenger
has ever driven the races

55:24.946 --> 55:26.448
to the full best-of-seven series.

55:28.241 --> 55:32.120
The Australians, dare we say it,
humiliated the Americans.

55:32.203 --> 55:36.541
So now it's three apiece.
One race to go, a true world series.

55:36.624 --> 55:39.419
-We can do it, Jim. We can do it.
-Oh yeah.

55:39.502 --> 55:43.006
The score went from 3-1 to 3-2 to 3-3.

55:44.257 --> 55:46.718
The Aussies had arrived.

55:47.427 --> 55:52.807
How does it feel being the first
in 132 years, which is a very long time,

55:52.891 --> 55:54.476
to be in this situation of three-all?

55:54.559 --> 55:56.936
I mean, it must concern you.

55:58.063 --> 56:01.733
It's gonna be very exciting
to be involved in the race of the century.

56:01.816 --> 56:05.028
We're hoping that, uh, we can find
a way to prevail

56:05.111 --> 56:07.489
like we have in, over the last 132 years.

56:07.572 --> 56:10.533
I think we have
an awful lot of tradition going for us,

56:10.617 --> 56:14.662
and, uh, somehow,
I think we'll pull it out on Saturday.

56:23.129 --> 56:27.008
Dennis was in
a super high-pressure environment.

56:29.844 --> 56:32.555
And the bottom line is
the New York Yacht Club

56:33.056 --> 56:37.435
were never in the business of losing,
literally, by any means.

56:37.519 --> 56:40.980
Panic, pure and simple,
has gripped the American camp.

56:41.064 --> 56:43.650
Shaken by Australia II's
effortless win in the sixth race,

56:43.733 --> 56:47.070
the Liberty syndicate
are resorting to truly desperate measures.

56:47.654 --> 56:51.866
Today the New York Yacht Club
just couldn't resist firing one more shot.

56:53.535 --> 56:57.497
Dennis and the team found
a loophole in the rule on the 11th hour

56:58.164 --> 57:00.166
and made major changes in Liberty.

57:00.750 --> 57:02.585
<i>The red defender was towed up river</i>

57:02.669 --> 57:06.047
<i>so that 1,000 pounds of her ballast</i>
<i>could be removed.</i>

57:06.131 --> 57:08.049
It had never happened before.

57:08.675 --> 57:11.636
But the New York Yacht Club
allowed them to do it.

57:12.137 --> 57:15.557
Would never have happened
if we wanted to reconfigure our boat.

57:16.891 --> 57:19.269
Like NASCAR, there are rules in NASCAR,

57:19.352 --> 57:22.439
but there's--
Rules are broken, and they win the race.

57:22.522 --> 57:24.107
You use the rules to your advantage

57:24.190 --> 57:26.234
to take advantage
of the other competition.

57:26.734 --> 57:28.236
No excuse to lose.

57:31.614 --> 57:36.953
Alan and the crew, the exercise
in which you're about to engage

57:37.036 --> 57:41.791
is certainly one of the historic moments
in Australian sporting history.

57:41.875 --> 57:44.294
You have all our best wishes with you.

57:44.377 --> 57:46.171
If it gets tight, let us know,

57:46.254 --> 57:48.965
and we'll all turn towards Newport
and blow to get you home.

57:49.048 --> 57:51.301
We're with you.
The very, very best of luck.

57:52.719 --> 57:55.513
No one had ever won it from the Americans.

57:55.597 --> 57:59.017
So here was history,
absolute history in the making.

57:59.934 --> 58:01.978
Always good to beat the Americans.

58:02.687 --> 58:03.980
At anything.

58:04.063 --> 58:07.901
<i>We're with you, Australia II!</i>

58:08.943 --> 58:12.947
<i>We're with you, Australia II!</i>

58:13.490 --> 58:15.200
<i>We're with you…</i>

58:17.327 --> 58:19.871
<i> It's the premier sailing event</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

58:19.954 --> 58:22.248
<i>It's the cup that's never been lost.</i>

58:22.332 --> 58:24.959
<i>It's the race that may end</i>
<i>the longest winning tradition</i>

58:25.043 --> 58:26.794
<i>in international sports history.</i>

58:27.420 --> 58:30.590
<i>Live from Newport,</i>
<i>this is the 25th defense,</i>

58:30.673 --> 58:32.842
<i>the final race for the America's Cup.</i>

58:37.514 --> 58:38.806
Good morning, the world.

58:38.890 --> 58:41.267
Once again, another live telecast

58:41.351 --> 58:45.313
to Australia, New Zealand,
Hong Kong, America and Europe.

58:46.189 --> 58:49.442
At the moment,
we have about 30 million people watching.

58:52.779 --> 58:55.323
<i> It's an emotional morning</i>
<i>for Mrs. Beryl Bertrand,</i>

58:55.406 --> 59:00.370
<i>as her son, John, takes Australia II</i>
<i>into the grand final of the America's Cup.</i>

59:01.746 --> 59:05.583
Today they sail the winner-take-all,
do-or-die, there's-no-tomorrow race.

59:14.676 --> 59:18.012
Being towed out,
I remember it was like a zoo.

59:18.096 --> 59:22.183
The envelope of people around us
was like a pressure cooker.

59:29.566 --> 59:33.570
We're lining up now for the start
of the seventh and vital race

59:33.653 --> 59:35.405
in this America's Cup.

59:36.072 --> 59:38.241
This is thousands of hours of preparation,

59:38.324 --> 59:40.243
a lifetime of preparation.

59:40.326 --> 59:43.871
And I'd visualized this space.
I'd visualized this time.

59:46.666 --> 59:47.875
I said to the team,

59:48.543 --> 59:52.422
"Visualize you're on the back of an eagle,
a thousand feet in the air."

59:58.553 --> 1:00:00.972
"And you see the boat
going through the water."

1:00:02.390 --> 1:00:06.436
So I said, "Reach down with big scissors
and cut the distractions,

1:00:06.519 --> 1:00:09.272
release the boat, release ourselves."

1:00:14.193 --> 1:00:16.487
"There's no tomorrow,
there's no yesterday,

1:00:16.571 --> 1:00:18.031
and there's no future."

1:00:18.990 --> 1:00:20.700
It was just today.

1:00:20.783 --> 1:00:22.744
<i>Five seconds away from the start.</i>

1:00:24.495 --> 1:00:26.706
-<i>There's the starting gun.</i>

1:00:26.789 --> 1:00:30.335
When the gun went off,
the two boats charged at each other.

1:00:30.418 --> 1:00:32.378
Here we go, you know. This is gonna be on.

1:00:33.463 --> 1:00:35.715
<i>They are neck-and-neck at the moment.</i>

1:00:35.798 --> 1:00:38.176
<i>John Bertrand has now turned</i>
<i>towards Liberty.</i>

1:00:38.259 --> 1:00:41.721
We actually had a good start,
and when we tacked, we were in front.

1:00:41.804 --> 1:00:44.057
<i>Australia's gone</i>
<i>right on top of Liberty</i>

1:00:44.140 --> 1:00:45.141
<i>by about two boat lengths.</i>

1:00:45.224 --> 1:00:46.684
<i>Both boats on starboard tack.</i>

1:00:47.435 --> 1:00:50.229
<i>Uh-oh! It looks like</i>
<i>John Bertrand has decided</i>

1:00:50.313 --> 1:00:51.689
<i>not to cover Dennis Conner.</i>

1:00:51.773 --> 1:00:53.566
But Dennis gets in front

1:00:54.359 --> 1:00:57.403
and, quite frankly,
starts to sail away from us.

1:01:01.491 --> 1:01:06.371
It became clear that Liberty was actually
a faster boat than what we'd seen before.

1:01:06.954 --> 1:01:08.122
The boat had been revved up.

1:01:08.748 --> 1:01:11.250
<i>The boat is gaining maximum speed</i>

1:01:11.334 --> 1:01:13.544
<i>moving very nicely</i>
<i>through the water there.</i>

1:01:13.628 --> 1:01:15.797
<i>She certainly looks like a different boat</i>

1:01:15.880 --> 1:01:18.049
<i>and obviously she's sailing</i>
<i>like a different boat today.</i>

1:01:19.008 --> 1:01:22.178
<i>You can see the two yachts</i>
<i>are now approaching the first marker,</i>

1:01:22.261 --> 1:01:24.472
<i>and it's not good news for Australia.</i>

1:01:24.555 --> 1:01:28.434
<i>Liberty is leading by 29 seconds</i>
<i>at the first mark.</i>

1:01:29.143 --> 1:01:31.562
<i> That failure</i>
<i>by John Bertrand to recover</i>

1:01:31.646 --> 1:01:32.563
<i>could be tragic.</i>

1:01:34.774 --> 1:01:38.069
We did everything we could,
but they just went faster.

1:01:38.945 --> 1:01:41.739
If you're just joining us,
it has been Liberty all the way.

1:01:41.823 --> 1:01:46.119
At the second mark, it was Liberty by 45.
At the third mark, Liberty by 23.

1:01:48.246 --> 1:01:52.125
They just swept away from us.
Close to a minute in front of us.

1:01:52.208 --> 1:01:53.918
We just couldn't believe it.

1:01:54.711 --> 1:01:56.087
<i> We're just watching</i>

1:01:56.170 --> 1:01:59.340
<i>Liberty having rounded the fourth mark</i>
<i>on the course,</i>

1:01:59.424 --> 1:02:01.843
<i>the margin around 55 seconds, Bob.</i>

1:02:02.427 --> 1:02:04.429
<i>The Cup is as good as lost.</i>

1:02:04.512 --> 1:02:07.265
It seems that Bertrand's errors
early in the race

1:02:07.348 --> 1:02:10.101
may have cost Australia II
the America's Cup.

1:02:10.184 --> 1:02:12.437
To get 58 seconds ahead, that…

1:02:13.438 --> 1:02:14.731
that's a long way.

1:02:16.983 --> 1:02:19.026
Four thousand people gathered outside

1:02:19.110 --> 1:02:21.362
the Royal Perth Yacht Club
in Western Australia,

1:02:21.446 --> 1:02:25.742
watching our live pictures
and, uh, similar scenes over in Sydney.

1:02:26.701 --> 1:02:29.954
<i> It appears</i>
<i>Liberty has a healthy lead at this point.</i>

1:02:30.037 --> 1:02:32.373
<i>It's a race Dennis Conner cannot lose.</i>

1:02:33.750 --> 1:02:36.544
<i> The tension mounts</i>
<i>at the Bertrand household.</i>

1:02:36.627 --> 1:02:38.755
<i>Mrs. Bertrand experiences the agony</i>

1:02:38.838 --> 1:02:43.384
<i>of watching The Wonder from Down Under</i>
<i>fall behind the American yacht, Liberty.</i>

1:02:44.260 --> 1:02:48.347
And, gentlemen, this downwind run
is possibly our last hope.

1:02:50.558 --> 1:02:52.393
They were basically gone.

1:02:53.936 --> 1:02:55.354
But the bottom line is,

1:02:55.438 --> 1:02:58.024
if the opposition
start to believe that the competition

1:02:58.107 --> 1:03:00.443
and the equipment
that they're using is superior,

1:03:01.152 --> 1:03:04.447
and you can't do anything about it
'cause it's secret,

1:03:04.530 --> 1:03:07.617
that becomes, psychologically,
a big hurdle to overcome.

1:03:09.118 --> 1:03:11.370
And ultimately, Dennis made a decision

1:03:12.371 --> 1:03:13.414
that was a mistake.

1:03:13.498 --> 1:03:16.334
<i>Dennis Conner's come</i>
<i>to the right-hand side of the course,</i>

1:03:16.417 --> 1:03:19.545
<i>looking for a big wind shift</i>
<i>which he hopes will be over here.</i>

1:03:19.629 --> 1:03:23.174
We get to the top marker<i>,</i>
and Dennis, he tacks way out.

1:03:24.091 --> 1:03:25.885
<i>This is an unusual move.</i>

1:03:25.968 --> 1:03:28.679
<i>Dennis has decided</i>
<i>not to cover John Bertrand.</i>

1:03:28.763 --> 1:03:31.516
He went to the right-hand side
of the course,

1:03:32.350 --> 1:03:33.810
and that surprised me.

1:03:36.604 --> 1:03:39.273
And I remember
just looking at the clouds evolving.

1:03:40.066 --> 1:03:42.151
I could start to see the wind on water.

1:03:45.196 --> 1:03:48.574
Darker patches and lighter patches.
I could see the direction of the wind.

1:03:51.619 --> 1:03:52.954
And then, eventually,

1:03:53.037 --> 1:03:56.332
you start to get a sixth sense
of what the wind is gonna do.

1:03:56.415 --> 1:03:59.919
Not now, but within
the next 10, 15 and 20 seconds,

1:04:00.795 --> 1:04:01.879
which is the game.

1:04:02.505 --> 1:04:03.339
Trim.

1:04:04.924 --> 1:04:09.220
And as we keep going to the left,
the breeze starts going left.

1:04:12.223 --> 1:04:13.099
Here we go.

1:04:16.561 --> 1:04:20.022
And we started to make gains on Liberty,
with extra wind.

1:04:21.357 --> 1:04:22.608
<i> As they head off there,</i>

1:04:22.692 --> 1:04:25.278
<i>you can see crewmen winding</i>
<i>those coffee grinder winches,</i>

1:04:25.361 --> 1:04:27.446
<i>trying to keep the yacht at maximum speed.</i>

1:04:27.530 --> 1:04:30.116
<i>It's going to be a mammoth effort</i>
<i>if she should do it.</i>

1:04:30.616 --> 1:04:33.035
It was meter by meter.
It was yard by yard.

1:04:33.119 --> 1:04:34.829
It was wind shift by wind shift.

1:04:37.665 --> 1:04:39.876
<i>There you see</i>
<i>Australia II coming back</i>

1:04:39.959 --> 1:04:41.752
<i>right now towards Liberty.</i>

1:04:42.253 --> 1:04:44.005
<i>This race is a hot one.</i>

1:04:44.964 --> 1:04:49.093
<i>Only a matter of minutes ago,</i>
<i>the America's Cup was as good as lost.</i>

1:04:49.176 --> 1:04:50.595
Gentlemen, it's neck and neck,

1:04:50.678 --> 1:04:53.639
but perhaps Liberty
just fractionally in front.

1:04:53.723 --> 1:04:56.475
<i>So Australia II is back in the race.</i>

1:04:58.144 --> 1:05:00.688
And then, of course,
they jibed and came across.

1:05:00.771 --> 1:05:03.941
The whole of the world,
who's watching this,

1:05:04.025 --> 1:05:05.026
is holding their breath.

1:05:05.109 --> 1:05:09.071
<i> The tension at the moment</i>
<i>is absolutely electric out there.</i>

1:05:09.155 --> 1:05:11.866
<i>Australia II's decided</i>
<i>to come back and attack.</i>

1:05:12.366 --> 1:05:15.036
It's not easy,
particularly from a helicopter shot,

1:05:15.119 --> 1:05:16.746
to see who's in front.

1:05:17.705 --> 1:05:18.956
What'll happen with the cross?

1:05:19.040 --> 1:05:23.127
And we went from 57 seconds behind
to bow on bow.

1:05:28.758 --> 1:05:33.054
I made the decision to jibe
on top of them, which was high risk.

1:05:33.763 --> 1:05:35.389
<i>A collision course at the moment.</i>

1:05:35.973 --> 1:05:38.768
<i>-Looks like Australia II will go across.</i>
<i>A gutsy move.</i>

1:05:38.851 --> 1:05:41.604
<i> An unbelievable move</i>
<i>to come across there now.</i>

1:05:44.440 --> 1:05:47.193
We went across their bow,
and we're in front.

1:05:47.777 --> 1:05:49.987
<i> It looks like</i>
<i>Australia II is back in front.</i>

1:05:50.071 --> 1:05:52.448
<i>-Absolutely incredible.</i>

1:05:52.531 --> 1:05:56.035
There's about 2,000 people here
packing Royal Perth Yacht Club,

1:05:56.118 --> 1:05:59.330
and they are absolutely rooting
for Australia II.

1:05:59.413 --> 1:06:02.708
I've never ever seen anything like this.

1:06:02.792 --> 1:06:05.378
There was mass disappointment here before.

1:06:05.461 --> 1:06:09.382
In the past leg,
it's been absolute mayhem in here.

1:06:10.299 --> 1:06:13.302
Australia II! Australia II!

1:06:16.305 --> 1:06:18.099
<i> And now it's all on.</i>

1:06:18.182 --> 1:06:21.185
<i>An absolute drag race to the finish.</i>
<i>Do you believe this, Bob Lobel?</i>

1:06:21.894 --> 1:06:24.730
<i> I've seen a lot of things,</i>
<i>but never anything like this.</i>

1:06:25.398 --> 1:06:26.482
Go, go, go!

1:06:32.655 --> 1:06:34.490
On that particular leg of the course,

1:06:34.573 --> 1:06:36.575
we probably sailed the boat
as best we'd ever sailed.

1:06:36.659 --> 1:06:40.746
We were closer to perfection
than any time I'd ever been.

1:06:44.250 --> 1:06:47.169
This group became so close and so tight.

1:06:47.253 --> 1:06:50.256
It was basically almost on autopilot.

1:06:51.382 --> 1:06:53.217
We were sailing into history.

1:07:03.019 --> 1:07:05.146
<i>We're looking for the smoke at any moment.</i>

1:07:05.229 --> 1:07:08.399
<i>They're about to do it.</i>
<i>They're about to cross the line.</i>

1:07:08.482 --> 1:07:10.818
<i>They make a final move. It's over!</i>

1:07:15.197 --> 1:07:16.824
<i> Australia II has done it!</i>

1:07:17.575 --> 1:07:20.119
<i>They have won the America's Cup!</i>

1:07:20.202 --> 1:07:24.165
<i>Will you stand up, Australia?</i>
<i>Will you stand up and cheer?</i>

1:07:24.248 --> 1:07:29.128
<i>Because this is the finest day</i>
<i>in the history of Australian sport.</i>

1:07:29.211 --> 1:07:30.796
<i>John Bertrand, the skipper,</i>

1:07:30.880 --> 1:07:33.924
<i>and all of those men</i>
<i>out there on that boat,</i>

1:07:34.008 --> 1:07:37.678
<i>they have written their name large</i>
<i>in Australian history.</i>

1:07:38.387 --> 1:07:40.598
<i>They have won the America's Cup.</i>

1:07:43.017 --> 1:07:45.144
While I was Prime Minister,

1:07:45.227 --> 1:07:48.314
I said some very wise
and important things,

1:07:48.397 --> 1:07:50.816
but I don't think anything I've ever said

1:07:51.358 --> 1:07:54.153
is as well remembered as when I said…

1:07:54.236 --> 1:07:58.657
I tell you what, any boss who sacks anyone
for not turning up today is a bum!

1:08:01.994 --> 1:08:02.828
Here we go!

1:08:03.329 --> 1:08:04.997
Across Australia, people are doing this,

1:08:05.081 --> 1:08:07.166
saluting the men of Australia II
with champagne.

1:08:07.249 --> 1:08:08.876
And boys, they really deserve it.

1:08:12.713 --> 1:08:16.342
I remember just going, "Shit,"
that it had happened.

1:08:17.384 --> 1:08:22.306
Really remember John just kind
of literally slumped over the wheel.

1:08:23.307 --> 1:08:26.477
Just like everything
just draining out of him.

1:08:27.937 --> 1:08:32.233
It was this relief to actually win it
on behalf of your country.

1:08:34.193 --> 1:08:35.736
That's, uh, that's huge.

1:08:45.704 --> 1:08:46.789
So…

1:08:47.540 --> 1:08:48.999
…how do you rationalize that?

1:08:51.377 --> 1:08:53.170
It was quite something

1:08:54.088 --> 1:08:56.632
that I never thought
could happen or would happen.

1:08:58.342 --> 1:08:59.260
But it did.

1:09:00.845 --> 1:09:04.557
It's a pretty powerful thing for me
to be feeling like I do now.

1:09:09.478 --> 1:09:10.688
So long ago.

1:09:13.315 --> 1:09:16.527
Must have affected me
more than I thought it did.

1:09:18.737 --> 1:09:19.822
Anyway.

1:09:24.743 --> 1:09:26.287
Everyone went nuts.

1:09:38.632 --> 1:09:40.217
We lifted our heads up,

1:09:40.301 --> 1:09:42.887
and there are boats
coming from everywhere.

1:09:42.970 --> 1:09:45.514
Boats all around us, you know?

1:09:45.598 --> 1:09:48.893
And this cacophony of noise.

1:10:10.581 --> 1:10:14.668
Ah! This is the greatest moment ever!

1:10:16.003 --> 1:10:17.004
Ah!

1:10:17.546 --> 1:10:22.426
I thought we were history,
history the beginning of the week.

1:10:22.509 --> 1:10:25.304
From the jaws of death.

1:10:27.223 --> 1:10:28.724
When we were getting towed in,

1:10:28.807 --> 1:10:31.143
we hoisted the Australian flag,

1:10:31.894 --> 1:10:36.565
and that was a really proud moment,
that we'd done something pretty special.

1:10:37.524 --> 1:10:40.611
<i>And this is just</i>
<i>such a tremendously festive scene,</i>

1:10:40.694 --> 1:10:43.113
<i>the sun now perched on the horizon</i>

1:10:43.197 --> 1:10:46.742
<i>as Australia II makes her way</i>
<i>back into Newport Harbor,</i>

1:10:46.825 --> 1:10:50.454
<i>the first challenger</i>
<i>ever to win the America's Cup.</i>

1:10:54.667 --> 1:10:58.545
<i>It is a mob scene here</i>
<i>on the dock of Australia II.</i>

1:10:59.755 --> 1:11:02.299
<i>The Australians have finally done it.</i>

1:11:12.768 --> 1:11:15.729
And I remember
pulling the boat out of the water,

1:11:15.813 --> 1:11:18.565
and Bondy like a conductor.

1:11:18.649 --> 1:11:25.364
Let's see the keel!

1:11:26.156 --> 1:11:28.284
<i>There's a very happy Alan Bond.</i>

1:11:28.367 --> 1:11:30.619
<i>He's gonna take it up</i>
<i>without the curtains.</i>

1:11:30.703 --> 1:11:32.371
<i>The keel is gonna be seen.</i>

1:11:33.289 --> 1:11:36.458
Get her up, Australia II,
and the skirt comes off.

1:11:36.542 --> 1:11:38.669
Everyone saw the winged keel
for the first time.

1:11:44.258 --> 1:11:47.511
<i> It's a brilliant piece</i>
<i>of engineering design work,</i>

1:11:47.594 --> 1:11:48.887
<i>extremely creative.</i>

1:11:49.805 --> 1:11:51.807
<i>Ben Lexcen,</i>
<i>designer of Australia II,</i>

1:11:51.890 --> 1:11:52.725
<i>the man who did it.</i>

1:11:52.808 --> 1:11:55.311
<i>He has achieved his life's ambition.</i>

1:11:55.978 --> 1:11:57.563
<i>There, believe it or not,</i>

1:11:57.646 --> 1:12:00.566
<i>Dennis Conner wearing</i>
<i>his New York Yacht Club hat.</i>

1:12:01.066 --> 1:12:02.651
Dennis congratulated me.

1:12:02.735 --> 1:12:05.821
Not a lot of words said,
but it was warrior to warrior.

1:12:05.904 --> 1:12:07.072
There's no question about it.

1:12:08.032 --> 1:12:11.201
<i> I think Dennis does look</i>
<i>a little bit stunned there, David.</i>

1:12:13.078 --> 1:12:14.872
I remember shaking hands with him,

1:12:14.955 --> 1:12:16.540
and he had tears in his eyes.

1:12:17.207 --> 1:12:20.586
Yeah, he took it hard, hard, really hard.

1:12:22.796 --> 1:12:23.672
Yeah.

1:12:29.595 --> 1:12:34.058
It was a totally devastating… loss.

1:12:43.233 --> 1:12:46.612
When I came in after losing the Cup,
they have a press conference,

1:12:46.695 --> 1:12:50.282
and nobody from the New York Yacht Club
shows up to sit with you,

1:12:50.366 --> 1:12:53.285
you got the idea
they don't like you very much anymore.

1:12:58.082 --> 1:13:01.085
I'm sure they were
understandably disappointed.

1:13:01.710 --> 1:13:05.839
You know, they were just
as devastated as I was in losing the Cup.

1:13:05.923 --> 1:13:09.593
Today, Australia II
was just a better boat,

1:13:11.595 --> 1:13:14.515
and they beat us, and we have no excuses.

1:13:16.392 --> 1:13:22.314
So I'd like to, uh, at this point,
congratulate Alan Bond and Australia II.

1:13:23.399 --> 1:13:26.193
They proved that they were
an outstanding boat.

1:13:28.904 --> 1:13:30.364
And today was their day.

1:13:33.283 --> 1:13:35.369
<i>It was Dennis Conner's last appearance</i>

1:13:35.452 --> 1:13:36.995
<i>as America's Cup skipper,</i>

1:13:37.079 --> 1:13:41.417
<i>a great performer bowing out a loser</i>
<i>with tears in his eyes</i>

1:13:41.500 --> 1:13:42.918
<i>and a whirl of his hat.</i>

1:13:45.462 --> 1:13:48.006
John Bertrand and his crew
have done a fine job today,

1:13:48.090 --> 1:13:53.387
and I'm so pleased
that we can say not goodbye to Newport,

1:13:54.012 --> 1:13:56.723
but an open invitation
to the people of Newport

1:13:56.807 --> 1:14:01.103
and the people of America
to come to Perth in Western Australia

1:14:01.186 --> 1:14:02.646
and try and win it back.

1:14:02.729 --> 1:14:03.856
We welcome you.

1:14:09.528 --> 1:14:12.239
When we actually were presented
with the America's Cup…

1:14:14.074 --> 1:14:16.493
when I lifted the trophy above my head,

1:14:17.870 --> 1:14:21.623
it was a boyhood dream becoming reality.

1:14:28.755 --> 1:14:31.175
It was a big deal to beat America
at something

1:14:31.258 --> 1:14:33.010
that America had been so dominant.

1:14:33.594 --> 1:14:38.182
So this little country,
suddenly it was on the world stage.

1:14:38.807 --> 1:14:42.227
Skipper John Bertrand,
you and the crew of the Australia II

1:14:42.311 --> 1:14:44.980
have shown us the stuff
of which Australians are made.

1:14:45.731 --> 1:14:49.776
I know your countrymen are proud of you,
and I want you to take this message back,

1:14:49.860 --> 1:14:51.487
that Americans are proud too.

1:14:52.070 --> 1:14:55.032
We're proud to have Australians
as our very dear friends.

1:14:59.036 --> 1:15:00.746
When we got back to Australia,

1:15:01.330 --> 1:15:07.252
they'd said we're gonna do a street parade
from Fremantle to Perth, which is--

1:15:07.336 --> 1:15:10.172
-Twenty-two kilometers.
-Twenty-two kilometers to be precise.

1:15:10.255 --> 1:15:13.800
I said, "We're gonna look like idiots
driving down Stirling Highway

1:15:13.884 --> 1:15:16.553
with three people and a dog waving at ya."

1:15:17.262 --> 1:15:23.685
Well, the street was lined
the whole 22 kilometers.

1:15:36.198 --> 1:15:37.824
When we got to Perth,

1:15:37.908 --> 1:15:42.204
there were 250,000 people there
to welcome us.

1:16:05.269 --> 1:16:10.023
We're such a small nation
going against such large odds.

1:16:10.107 --> 1:16:13.193
But it was that terrific determination

1:16:13.277 --> 1:16:16.613
of the people of Australia
and all the guys.

1:16:20.033 --> 1:16:22.995
After losing the Cup,
I had no money.

1:16:23.745 --> 1:16:24.955
I was a carpet salesman.

1:16:27.583 --> 1:16:29.376
I was certainly depressed.

1:16:29.918 --> 1:16:34.256
But when I saw 21 different countries
challenging for the Cup in Perth,

1:16:34.923 --> 1:16:37.968
maybe I should quit
feeling sorry for myself

1:16:38.051 --> 1:16:40.387
and see what I could do
about winning it back.

1:16:41.096 --> 1:16:43.098
<i>Today, in San Diego, California,</i>

1:16:43.181 --> 1:16:47.477
<i>Dennis Conner announced his comeback</i>
<i>for the 1987 America's Cup.</i>

1:16:49.021 --> 1:16:53.984
<i>However, he will not be facing the skipper</i>
<i>who wrenched away the trophy in 1983.</i>

1:16:54.901 --> 1:16:57.154
Why aren't you in it this year?

1:16:57.237 --> 1:16:58.697
The fire's out of my belly,

1:16:58.780 --> 1:17:01.033
and content people
don't become world champions.

1:17:01.116 --> 1:17:02.826
I'm content in that part of my life,

1:17:02.909 --> 1:17:05.954
and I'm really keen and excited
to move out into new directions.

1:17:06.038 --> 1:17:07.122
That's what I'm doing.

1:17:07.914 --> 1:17:10.375
But for Dennis and coming back,

1:17:10.459 --> 1:17:12.502
it was an opportunity
to resurrect himself.

1:17:20.969 --> 1:17:23.305
<i> There's the gun.</i>
<i>Stars & Stripes has done it.</i>

1:17:23.388 --> 1:17:25.307
<i>They've won the America's Cup.</i>

1:17:26.266 --> 1:17:28.393
<i>He has climbed yachting's Mount Everest,</i>

1:17:28.477 --> 1:17:31.521
<i>and he has captured, once again,</i>
<i>yachting's holy grail.</i>

1:17:32.481 --> 1:17:34.483
<i>Revenge for Dennis Conner.</i>

1:17:44.660 --> 1:17:47.120
I remember sitting in the ceremony

1:17:47.204 --> 1:17:48.789
handing over the America's Cup,

1:17:49.623 --> 1:17:53.335
and this lovely lady with a big hat said,
"Hello, Mr. Bertrand."

1:17:53.418 --> 1:17:56.713
"What a beautiful day it is.
What a day of celebration."

1:17:56.797 --> 1:18:00.133
And I looked at her and I said,
"Madam, you have no idea…

1:18:03.387 --> 1:18:07.891
how easy it was to lose
and how hard it was to win."

1:18:24.491 --> 1:18:26.159
<i>Bond's property interests stretch</i>

1:18:26.243 --> 1:18:28.787
<i>from Sydney to America</i>
<i>to London and Hong Kong.</i>

1:18:28.870 --> 1:18:32.499
<i>It is an empire worth $10,000 million.</i>

1:18:34.584 --> 1:18:37.796
<i>We want all the crew</i>
<i>to come back out. Sing it for them.</i>

1:18:47.013 --> 1:18:49.474
<i>Probably the greatest</i>
<i>Prime Minister of Australia.</i>

1:18:49.558 --> 1:18:51.810
<i>He relates to the people.</i>
<i>The public love him.</i>

1:18:51.893 --> 1:18:54.104
<i>What does one of our</i>
<i>greatest prime ministers do?</i>

1:18:54.187 --> 1:18:57.190
<i>He sculled it. Listen to them.</i>
<i>They're going, "Scull, scull, scull!"</i>

1:18:57.274 --> 1:18:59.484
<i>And the great man, Bobby Hawke, nailed it.</i>

1:18:59.568 --> 1:19:02.237
<i>He said, "Thank you very much, boys.</i>
<i>Cheers."</i>

1:19:07.242 --> 1:19:11.663
<i> Ben Lexcen, designer, perfectionist,</i>
<i>and his Toyota Tarago,</i>

1:19:11.747 --> 1:19:14.040
<i>a design that pleases even Ben Lexcen.</i>

1:19:14.124 --> 1:19:16.501
Somebody did it right again.

1:19:26.219 --> 1:19:29.139
<i> And at mark number four,</i>
<i>it's American Magic.</i>

1:19:29.222 --> 1:19:32.517
<i>She turns toward home</i>
<i>at 50 knots per hour.</i>

1:19:32.601 --> 1:19:33.685
<i>This is it!</i>

1:19:33.769 --> 1:19:37.481
<i>Welcome to the 2021 America's Cup.</i>

1:19:39.858 --> 1:19:44.446
<i>Allegations against one basketball ref</i>
<i>of betting the outcomes of games</i>

1:19:44.529 --> 1:19:45.947
<i>is rocking the NBA.</i>

1:19:46.907 --> 1:19:49.618
<i> Man, did I fuck my life up.</i>

1:19:51.244 --> 1:19:55.999
Just like the feel-good hit of the summer,
the Manti Te'o story isn't real.

1:19:56.625 --> 1:19:58.251
<i> Cruel, twisted hoax.</i>

1:19:59.669 --> 1:20:02.839
It was the longest winning streak
in the history of sport.

1:20:02.923 --> 1:20:07.552
<i> This is the finest day</i>
<i>in the history of Australian sports.</i>

1:20:07.636 --> 1:20:10.806
AND1 was making millions of dollars,

1:20:10.889 --> 1:20:12.474
but did they respect us?

1:20:13.058 --> 1:20:15.894
<i> AND1 basketball, baby!</i>

1:20:15.977 --> 1:20:18.814
Shut your fuckin' mouth,
keep it between us.

1:20:19.564 --> 1:20:21.483
Stick to the fuckin' story.

1:20:22.108 --> 1:20:24.236
<i>It does not get any stranger</i>
<i>than this one.</i>

1:20:24.319 --> 1:20:26.029
<i>Donaghy is under investigation…</i>

1:20:26.112 --> 1:20:28.448
<i>It's front-page news all over town.</i>

1:20:29.366 --> 1:20:31.660
She physically did not exist

1:20:31.743 --> 1:20:34.287
outside of being
Manti Te'o's dead girlfriend.

1:20:36.206 --> 1:20:41.378
And I was like, "Boy, that would be
fuckin' crazy if it were true."
