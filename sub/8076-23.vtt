WEBVTT

00:00.401 --> 00:03.771
[tone]

00:03.804 --> 00:08.209
[music playing]

00:08.242 --> 00:10.044
It could use a
little more work.

00:10.078 --> 00:11.512
But I think Darlene,
David, and the baby

00:11.545 --> 00:13.281
will be comfortable
here for a month or two

00:13.314 --> 00:15.683
or whenever they decide
to go back to Chicago.

00:15.716 --> 00:18.652
Yeah, what could Chicago
possibly have to offer them,

00:18.686 --> 00:22.456
besides culture and excitement?

00:22.490 --> 00:24.992
See, we need some
room darkening shades,

00:25.025 --> 00:26.227
some outlet cover thingies.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.829
And we could baby
proof the room later.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.065
Yeah, and at some point we're
going to have to re-paint.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.800
Oh, no, Honey.

00:32.833 --> 00:36.204
The paint's holding
up pretty well.

00:36.237 --> 00:37.238
Well, of course it is.

00:37.271 --> 00:40.874
There's nothing more
durable than lead.

00:40.908 --> 00:41.975
It ain't lead paint.

00:42.009 --> 00:45.045
They haven't made lead
paint in 20 years.

00:45.079 --> 00:48.316
Replace lead paint.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.984
Don't forget the baby monitor.

00:51.018 --> 00:52.086
What are you talking about?

00:52.120 --> 00:53.654
They're-- David and
Darlene will be sleeping

00:53.687 --> 00:55.556
right next to the crib.
- It's not for them.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.125
It's for me.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.827
If that baby cries,
I want to hear it.

00:59.860 --> 01:02.896
And if Darlene and David just
happen to be talking about us,

01:02.930 --> 01:06.134
well, then I'll turn it down.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.369
Or not.

01:08.402 --> 01:11.071
Sly puss.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.674
You know, I think it's totally
cool our granddaughter is

01:13.707 --> 01:15.609
going to be live in this room.

01:15.643 --> 01:18.212
Well, all our kids pass
through here at some point.

01:18.246 --> 01:20.114
It's like our own
personal Ellis Island.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.152
What are you doing in my room?

01:24.185 --> 01:25.153
You handle this, Dan.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.922
Actually, DJ, your niece is
coming home from a hospital

01:28.956 --> 01:29.957
next week.

01:29.990 --> 01:32.426
And David, Darlene.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.728
Oh, God, you're shipping me
to the basement, aren't you?

01:34.762 --> 01:36.697
Come on, a basement
isn't that bad.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.866
It's pretty nice.

01:38.899 --> 01:39.767
It's warm.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.969
You got your own furnace.

01:42.002 --> 01:43.171
Yeah, my own spiderwebs.

01:43.204 --> 01:44.305
My own asbestos.

01:44.338 --> 01:45.573
That's right.

01:45.606 --> 01:50.077
Spiderwebs, no flies, asbestos,
no fires, case closed.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.745
But Mom you were going
to turn the basement back

01:51.779 --> 01:53.314
into your writing room.

01:53.347 --> 01:54.948
Well, we all have
to make sacrifices.

01:54.982 --> 01:56.217
And that's mine.

01:56.250 --> 01:59.420
Besides, DJ, the basement
is the perfect environment

01:59.453 --> 02:01.522
for a growing lad,
such as yourself.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.924
Yeah, hey, have you ever
heard "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"

02:03.957 --> 02:05.259
played down there?

02:05.293 --> 02:06.794
It's awesome!

02:06.827 --> 02:09.363
Plus, you've got those
ground floor windows.

02:09.397 --> 02:11.131
You can sneak out
whenever you want.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.500
Yeah, well, how
am I going to do

02:12.533 --> 02:16.270
that when I'm gasping for air
and covered in spider bites?

02:16.304 --> 02:17.171
Ask David.

02:17.205 --> 02:19.207
He did it for years.

02:19.240 --> 02:24.011
THEME SONG: What doesn't kill
us is making us stronger.

02:24.044 --> 02:26.380
We're gonna' last longer.

02:26.414 --> 02:29.350
Than that greatest
wall of China.

02:29.383 --> 02:32.786
Oh, that rapping with a drum.

02:32.820 --> 02:36.257
If there's one thing
that I've learned,

02:36.290 --> 02:38.226
while waiting for my turn.

02:38.259 --> 02:41.695
It's that [inaudible]
of rain falls,

02:41.729 --> 02:44.665
but you also get some sun.

02:44.698 --> 02:48.101
And we'll make out
better than okay.

02:48.135 --> 02:49.102
Hey.

02:49.136 --> 02:51.071
Hear what I say?

02:51.104 --> 02:52.072
Yeah.

02:52.105 --> 02:53.474
Yeah, any day.

03:01.482 --> 03:02.916
[laughter]

03:02.950 --> 03:06.920
[music playing]

03:06.954 --> 03:09.657
I can't believe the baby's
really coming home today.

03:09.690 --> 03:13.394
I thought she's never
make it out of the shop.

03:13.427 --> 03:14.962
I'm so excited, too.

03:14.995 --> 03:16.830
And the best part is
that this time I'm

03:16.864 --> 03:19.867
not recovering from the birth.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.835
Yeah, we have a lot
to be thankful for.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.504
What is this?

03:23.537 --> 03:25.373
Oh, that's one of those
deals where it sounds

03:25.406 --> 03:27.775
like the mom's heart beat.

03:27.808 --> 03:28.842
Woah.

03:28.876 --> 03:32.513
So that's what a healthy
heart sounds like.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.615
Oh, hey, did DJ
get all his stuff

03:34.648 --> 03:36.250
moved out of the basement?
- Yeah, he did.

03:36.284 --> 03:37.217
Good.

03:37.251 --> 03:39.320
now I can volunteer to help him.

03:39.353 --> 03:42.823
Do you think that
my asking Darlene

03:42.856 --> 03:46.193
and David to move in here
was the right thing to do?

03:46.226 --> 03:47.561
Well, isn't that
what you want?

03:47.595 --> 03:48.696
Yeah.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.664
Well, that used to be
the right things to do.

03:50.698 --> 03:53.667
Did some change around here?

03:53.701 --> 03:56.036
No, I just wondered if maybe
I'm being a little selfish.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.839
You know, maybe if I'm doing
this more for me than for them.

03:58.872 --> 03:59.773
You probably are.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.475
But it's still a
nice thing to do.

04:09.216 --> 04:11.352
What if they don't
want to move in here.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.454
Honey, why are you
so worried about this?

04:13.487 --> 04:14.688
Figure it out, Dan.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.557
If they don't like
the accommodations,

04:16.590 --> 04:17.925
OK, they check out early.

04:17.958 --> 04:21.962
And they'll try to sneak that
baby out of here with them.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.163
Honey, that's what kids do.

04:23.196 --> 04:24.898
They leave the nest.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.734
Now you should be proud.

04:26.767 --> 04:31.539
We've raised some independent
free spirited individuals.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.474
What the hell
were we thinking?

04:33.507 --> 04:36.777
Everything's going to be OK.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.480
Oh, I've got to go.

04:39.513 --> 04:42.082
I've got to pick everybody
up from the hospital.

04:42.115 --> 04:46.454
Our granddaughter will
be coming home shortly.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.055
Wow, that sounds so great.

04:48.088 --> 04:50.424
Say it again, Dan, louder.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.826
Roseanne and
Dan's granddaughter

04:52.860 --> 04:54.662
is coming home today.

04:54.695 --> 04:55.829
Let's get ready to rumble!

05:03.003 --> 05:04.037
Sassy.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.739
Spin around let me
check out that caboose.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.315
All right.

05:15.349 --> 05:16.717
That's it, Roseanne.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.987
Four bottles of pine cleanser
and two cans of lemon Pledge.

05:20.020 --> 05:23.791
This house is clean.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.760
OK.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.629
I've got the bathroom
clean as a whistle.

05:28.662 --> 05:32.900
OK, that sandpaper and
bleach goes a long way.

05:32.933 --> 05:33.934
Good job.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.536
Now get on the phone
and tell everybody

05:35.569 --> 05:37.505
that we're having a
homecoming party for the baby.

05:37.538 --> 05:40.207
And they got to get here before
the house gets dirty again.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.442
Hey.

05:41.475 --> 05:42.443
And if you're going to wear
that thing on your head,

05:42.476 --> 05:43.276
make me some pancakes.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.549
Can you believe it, Roseanne?

05:48.582 --> 05:50.718
We're bringing
another baby home.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.753
This is a lucky house.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.655
Yeah, it adapts
well to new life.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.425
I can't imagine this
family living anywhere else.

05:57.458 --> 06:01.629
Yeah, watery or no, I could
never get rid of this house.

06:01.662 --> 06:04.197
OK, Mark is asking if
you wanted to score a keg?

06:07.935 --> 06:08.869
Um, no, that's OK.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.771
I think I'll just
fire up the Harley

06:10.804 --> 06:12.840
and take the baby out on
her first beer run myself.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.213
Ladies and gentlemen, it is
my pleasure to introduce Ms.

06:20.247 --> 06:22.382
Harris Conner-Healy.

06:22.416 --> 06:29.623
[applause]

06:29.657 --> 06:31.792
So what do you
think of the joint?

06:31.825 --> 06:32.993
What's not to like?

06:33.026 --> 06:35.796
At least, she's not under
that grow bulb any more.

06:35.829 --> 06:39.366
Sweetie, this
is your new house.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.468
Look at those eyes.

06:40.501 --> 06:41.802
I think she likes it here.

06:41.835 --> 06:42.836
Well, of course she does.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.337
This is where all
the Conners belong.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.510
Smells like pine forest.

06:52.513 --> 06:56.850
Next to a lemon grove.

06:56.884 --> 06:57.685
Over a landfill.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.925
Yeah, and then I was thinking
this rocking chair here

07:04.958 --> 07:06.126
should be right in
front the window,

07:06.159 --> 07:08.228
so you can sit there
and feed the baby.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.197
And then look out and
yell at the neighbor kids

07:10.230 --> 07:13.000
to stay off your lawn.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.802
Well, Mom, I don't want to
turn into you all at once.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.373
Take a big fat look in the
mirror, Darlene, you lost.

07:24.177 --> 07:27.247
OK, well, if you guys
don't need me I'll go

07:27.280 --> 07:28.549
get the rest of the
stuff out of the car.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.353
Right.

07:33.386 --> 07:35.055
I'm going.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.124
Oh, I can't wait
to see the baby

07:37.157 --> 07:38.258
in these cute little outfits.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.964
Is this one of the
t-shirt you've got?

07:43.997 --> 07:44.965
I think so.
Why?

07:44.998 --> 07:46.133
Does she need more?

07:46.166 --> 07:47.367
Yeah, I mean when
you were her age,

07:47.400 --> 07:49.737
I had at least twice this many.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.471
Of course, some of them
were your dad's old socks.

07:55.408 --> 07:58.045
I'm really glad
you're here, Darlene.

07:58.078 --> 07:59.312
I am too.

07:59.346 --> 08:02.215
Good, because you know I
don't want you to be here.

08:02.249 --> 08:04.017
unless you want to be here.

08:04.051 --> 08:05.719
Oh, yeah, and I mean
and I wouldn't be here

08:05.753 --> 08:07.655
unless I wanted to be here.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.456
And of course, you
wanted me to be here.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.892
Oh, yeah, definitely
I want you to be here.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.126
For now.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.194
Right.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.095
Yeah, for now.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.296
Yeah, that's great.

08:16.329 --> 08:20.734
I mean because now
could be an hour.

08:20.768 --> 08:23.170
Or More.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.271
Yeah, whatever.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.406
I mean, you have to do
what makes you happy.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.375
You can't worry about
hurting my feelings.

08:28.408 --> 08:30.177
Mom, I never worry about
hurting your feelings.

08:33.881 --> 08:36.449
I just want to stick
around for a little while,

08:36.483 --> 08:39.452
so I can learn some
stuff from you.

08:39.486 --> 08:43.023
Oh, Darlene, you already
know a lot of stuff.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.793
You changed DJ's diaper once.

08:45.826 --> 08:48.328
Don't remind me.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.797
See you're lucky
you got a girl.

08:49.830 --> 08:53.734
Their aim isn't nearly as good.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.269
You know, I mean, it's
not the little things

08:56.303 --> 09:00.173
like how often do I feed
her, when do I change her,

09:00.207 --> 09:02.109
stuff like that.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.443
It's the big things, you know.

09:03.476 --> 09:08.315
I mean like, God, how do I
help her become a good person?

09:08.348 --> 09:10.550
You just have to watch
a lot of public television

09:10.584 --> 09:11.685
and the rest takes
care of itself.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.455
You don't have to
know everything

09:15.488 --> 09:16.724
all at once, Darlene.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.025
I sure didn't.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.526
You didn't?

09:19.559 --> 09:21.461
I mean, I was your
age when I had Becky.

09:21.494 --> 09:24.131
And I didn't even know
half of what you know now.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.398
Oh, so that's why
you kept her, right?

09:28.969 --> 09:31.138
I did what I had to do
to make sure my kids got

09:31.171 --> 09:33.040
what they needed.
And you'll do the same.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.207
You really think so?

09:34.241 --> 09:35.108
Of course.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.410
I'll give you a great example.

09:37.444 --> 09:38.912
Remember that time
when I had to go down

09:38.946 --> 09:40.413
to your school to
talk to your teacher

09:40.447 --> 09:44.217
because you'd been
barking in class?

09:44.251 --> 09:45.786
Vaguely.

09:45.819 --> 09:49.556
Well, see, I'd never been in
a situation like that before.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.891
And I didn't really
know what to do.

09:50.924 --> 09:54.094
But then all of a sudden, my
mother instincts kicked in.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.896
And I did the exact right thing.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.597
What did you do?

09:57.631 --> 09:58.932
Oh, good.

09:58.966 --> 10:01.368
You're still repressing that
memory of obedience school.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.205
Come on, Mom.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.540
Look, Darlene,
everything's going to be OK.

10:07.574 --> 10:10.911
You know, I mean the hard part
doesn't even come till later,

10:10.944 --> 10:12.312
when you look at
your kid and realize

10:12.345 --> 10:14.915
it's not just your baby,
it's a real human being.

10:14.948 --> 10:19.419
And she's going to do things
the way she wants to do them.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.455
But that's also the best part.

10:22.489 --> 10:23.657
You really think so?

10:23.691 --> 10:24.491
No, not really.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.229
Actually, the best
part is when you

10:29.262 --> 10:34.134
can mold their tender little
egos to fit your every whim.

10:34.167 --> 10:38.706
God, I can't believe I barked.

10:38.739 --> 10:39.940
Oh, honey, we all barked.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.250
Hey what's this some
new religious thing?

10:50.283 --> 10:52.920
Uh, a little help here.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.463
I think I snapped my pelvis.

11:05.598 --> 11:06.399
Thanks.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.678
It's not so bad
down here, you know.

11:18.712 --> 11:21.214
Just remember they're
not cockroaches,

11:21.248 --> 11:22.615
they're water beetles.

11:22.649 --> 11:23.450
OK.

11:29.256 --> 11:30.858
Well, you know, I kind
of feel bad about moving

11:30.891 --> 11:32.092
you down here to the basement.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.161
But the only thing
I can say to you

11:34.194 --> 11:37.998
is the same thing I said to
Becky and then to Darlene.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.833
We love the new
baby more than you.

11:43.670 --> 11:44.537
It's OK.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.706
I'm kind of fond of her myself.

11:46.740 --> 11:49.877
You know, but down here, I can
have more than just bedroom.

11:49.910 --> 11:52.145
I have like a whole studio.

11:52.179 --> 11:55.582
OK, over here I'm going to
put like my editing bay.

11:55.615 --> 11:57.117
You know what that is, right?

11:57.150 --> 11:59.052
Where you edit?

11:59.086 --> 12:00.020
Right.

12:00.053 --> 12:03.123
OK, now I put my
computer over here.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.625
And that'll be like my
pre-production area.

12:05.658 --> 12:06.794
And all I need is
like a corkboard,

12:06.827 --> 12:09.162
a couple of pushpins.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.799
And of course, a project.

12:11.832 --> 12:14.367
OK, I'm going to leave
this space over here blank.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.237
It's going to be like
my home theater system.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.105
Pass that along to Santa.

12:20.207 --> 12:22.175
Santa, huh?

12:22.209 --> 12:24.011
Well, there's another
little talk we need to have.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.816
No, I'm really
proud of you, son.

12:28.849 --> 12:29.716
Mom.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.051
No, I know.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.787
I've said this all
before, haven't I?

12:33.821 --> 12:35.322
Well?

12:35.355 --> 12:36.723
this is a different
kind of proud, though.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.725
It's not like the
same kind of proud

12:38.758 --> 12:41.694
I was when you took
your first steps,

12:41.728 --> 12:43.997
or when you got your
first c in math.

12:46.666 --> 12:50.838
It's more of a grown up
kind of a proud, you know?

12:50.871 --> 12:51.972
It's like you have a little boy.

12:52.005 --> 12:53.573
And you watch him
eat all his crayons.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.142
And he's biting
people and stuff.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.845
And you wonder what kind of a
guy is going to grow up to be.

12:57.878 --> 13:01.114
And then one day he does
something very classy.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.983
And you realize that
some woman is going

13:03.016 --> 13:05.785
to owe you a great big
thank you note for raising

13:05.819 --> 13:07.454
such a wonderful son.

13:07.487 --> 13:08.755
Wow, a woman!

13:11.558 --> 13:13.793
Did you hear any of
that other stuff I said?

13:13.827 --> 13:14.627
Yeah.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.800
You know, this as going
to be your writing room.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.169
I could teach you how
to use my computer.

13:22.202 --> 13:26.773
Oh, my own dungeon!

13:26.806 --> 13:27.674
It's an office.

13:27.707 --> 13:29.476
So you can write.

13:29.509 --> 13:30.410
Oh, my own office!

13:30.443 --> 13:31.444
You like it?

13:31.478 --> 13:33.280
It's my own office!

13:33.313 --> 13:34.948
It's so you don't
bother us when you write.

13:34.982 --> 13:35.849
Wow, it's great!

13:35.883 --> 13:38.285
It's fantastic!

13:38.318 --> 13:40.587
Yeah, I put all the
shelves in here for all your,

13:40.620 --> 13:42.589
uh, you know, the
stuff you write.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.824
Manuscripts.

13:44.858 --> 13:48.095
Man, I can't believe that
you remember when this was

13:48.128 --> 13:50.063
going to be my writing room.

13:50.097 --> 13:53.233
It was like one of
your greatest birthdays.

13:53.266 --> 14:01.474
[music playing]

14:01.508 --> 14:04.277
We got some shoesies.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.914
And a cute little hat.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.849
And, uh...

14:09.883 --> 14:11.584
Some kind of damn
little girly thing.

14:11.618 --> 14:14.521
And-- Oh, yes.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.256
The last dress
Darlene ever wore.

14:18.725 --> 14:19.859
You see?

14:19.893 --> 14:21.995
It's fun poking through
all stuff, ain't it?

14:22.029 --> 14:25.165
Well, we haven't had much
fun around here in a while.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.666
Yeah, these are good times.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.369
I guess we deserve some.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.871
It has been a very weird year.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.806
Yeah, well.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.508
I think that Roseanne
is really glad to have

14:35.542 --> 14:37.344
you back in the house again.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.612
I was sitting in a
motel by the airport.

14:39.646 --> 14:45.352
I finally realized the whole
California thing was so stupid.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.954
I belong here.

14:46.987 --> 14:50.257
I'm glad to hear you say that.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.792
And I think Roseanne is glad
to be home, too, you know.

14:52.825 --> 14:55.862
That the time we spent
running around on trains

14:55.895 --> 14:58.531
and going to spas and
hobnobbing in the Hamptons,

14:58.565 --> 15:00.000
it just didn't work for us.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.801
I mean, don't get me
wrong, it was fun.

15:04.337 --> 15:05.138
Well, not for me.

15:09.242 --> 15:12.445
OK, it's time for the
dumping of the nipples.

15:18.385 --> 15:19.652
Wow.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.888
Looks like a naked
synchronized swim team.

15:24.124 --> 15:24.992
Hey, hey.

15:25.025 --> 15:25.925
I got the pictures.

15:29.529 --> 15:30.430
Look at all this stuff.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.769
Darlene used to tie
up DJ with these ones.

15:36.803 --> 15:42.009
Yeah, I used to string of
David with my mom's nylons.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.176
Very resourceful.

15:43.210 --> 15:44.077
You know.

15:44.111 --> 15:47.414
I do what I can.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.117
I think it's so great that
Mom saved all this stuff.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.085
I wonder if she saved
any stuff for you.

15:52.119 --> 15:52.919
Mom!

15:56.223 --> 15:57.457
Maybe you were right, Dan.

15:57.490 --> 16:00.093
It is kind of cool
saving stuff like this.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.061
Yoo hoo!

16:01.094 --> 16:02.029
I'm here!

16:02.062 --> 16:02.895
Haul out the holly.

16:09.236 --> 16:10.570
Then again, there
is something to be

16:10.603 --> 16:12.005
said for throwing out the old.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.010
Did you get a
border to border?

16:17.044 --> 16:18.411
What on earth is that?

16:18.445 --> 16:21.814
Canadian bacon and
jalapeno peppers.

16:21.848 --> 16:25.118
Don't you know you're
international [inaudible]

16:25.152 --> 16:27.320
One border to
border, right here.

16:27.354 --> 16:28.221
Who wants a soda?

16:28.255 --> 16:29.122
Me!

16:29.156 --> 16:31.591
I do!

16:31.624 --> 16:33.493
Ew, anchovies.

16:33.526 --> 16:34.394
Oh, wait.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.228
I'll take that one!

16:40.400 --> 16:44.671
I just feel like anchovies.

16:44.704 --> 16:47.140
Look, Everyone, discovery!

16:47.174 --> 16:50.743
If you fold your pizza, you
can make your own calzone.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.113
[inaudible]

16:53.146 --> 16:55.415
The baby woke up when
she smelled the pizza.

16:55.448 --> 16:56.316
It's official.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.918
She's a real Conner.

16:58.951 --> 17:01.321
This is just the best.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.689
Yeah.

17:02.722 --> 17:06.126
I really liked the way this
place's cheese grips across,

17:06.159 --> 17:08.027
you know?

17:08.061 --> 17:10.097
If you ever had scalding
hot cheese in your lap,

17:10.130 --> 17:13.166
you'd appreciate what
I'm talking about.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.033
No, honey.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.103
I wasn't talking
about the pizza.

17:16.136 --> 17:19.239
I was talking about all of
us being together like this.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.141
You know, just
being here together.

17:21.174 --> 17:21.974
Yeah, that too.

17:26.213 --> 17:29.116
Hey, what about
somebody saying grace?

17:29.149 --> 17:30.016
Grace?

17:30.049 --> 17:31.050
We never say grace.

17:31.084 --> 17:31.984
No, I know.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.253
But isn't it about
time to start?

17:33.286 --> 17:35.222
I mean, we owe God in a big way.

17:35.255 --> 17:38.125
Yeah, I must just said
1,000 prayers in every corner

17:38.158 --> 17:39.526
of that hospital.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.329
Well, you know everybody prays
when stuff is like in crisis.

17:42.362 --> 17:46.366
But how many people really
pray when stuff's going good?

17:46.399 --> 17:49.202
I do.

17:49.236 --> 17:52.372
Nobody say anything
bad about her.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.273
Well, what do we do?

17:53.306 --> 17:54.707
Do we hold hands or something?

17:54.741 --> 17:56.243
You know, I just think
the important thing

17:56.276 --> 18:00.713
is that we need to stop praying
in dark corners and hiding.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.049
We should start
praying the way we

18:03.082 --> 18:08.221
fight, out loud and in public,
where everybody can hear it.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.589
OK.

18:09.622 --> 18:10.423
All right.

18:12.992 --> 18:17.530
Dear God, we thank
you for everything,

18:17.564 --> 18:21.601
not just for the pizza, which
we are about to receive.

18:21.634 --> 18:25.305
Although we do love
pizza, as you well know.

18:29.576 --> 18:32.645
I don't know if I could really
find the words to express

18:32.679 --> 18:37.884
how grateful I am to just have
the family here, all together,

18:37.917 --> 18:39.486
and everybody being healthy.

18:39.519 --> 18:46.459
And that's more important than
winning the lottery 100 times.

18:46.493 --> 18:49.095
I think most of all, we
would like to thank you

18:49.128 --> 18:51.964
for answering our prayers
and letting Darlene

18:51.998 --> 18:55.735
and David's little girl
beat all of the odds,

18:55.768 --> 18:59.939
just like us Connors always do.

18:59.972 --> 19:00.773
Amen.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.713
That's really nice, Honey.

19:06.746 --> 19:07.780
Thank you.

19:07.814 --> 19:11.351
Well, you know, words
are like my thing.

19:11.384 --> 19:16.155
[music playing, applause]

19:16.189 --> 19:18.891
I put the baby down
in Mom and Dad's bed.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.027
Are you sure she won't
roll over the edge?

19:21.060 --> 19:23.363
David, she's
surrounded by pillows.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.198
Besides, she's in that
huge divot in the middle.

19:30.102 --> 19:33.640
Hey, are you OK with all this?

19:33.673 --> 19:35.041
What?

19:35.074 --> 19:37.677
You know, staying here with
my parents for a while.

19:37.710 --> 19:38.711
Are you kidding?

19:38.745 --> 19:39.546
I love it here.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.117
It's never dull.

19:45.151 --> 19:47.053
Oh, cool, because you
know I just feel safe being

19:47.086 --> 19:48.388
near my mom right now.

19:48.421 --> 19:51.324
You know, at least until the
baby is bigger and stronger.

19:51.358 --> 19:54.827
Well, people in this house do
tend to get bigger, don't they?

19:59.165 --> 20:00.933
And you know, I mean
I think it would be

20:00.967 --> 20:02.535
really great for my dad, too.

20:02.569 --> 20:05.638
He acts like 20 years younger
when he's around the baby.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.073
It's got to be good
for him after the heart

20:07.106 --> 20:08.575
attack and everything, right?

20:08.608 --> 20:09.742
Yeah.

20:09.776 --> 20:10.743
Yeah, it's great.

20:10.777 --> 20:11.644
You know what this is.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.145
It's really tribal.

20:13.179 --> 20:15.282
Tribal?

20:15.315 --> 20:16.316
Note to myself.

20:16.349 --> 20:19.786
I alone will teach
the baby new words.

20:19.819 --> 20:22.389
I just mean that Harris
will get to start off her life

20:22.422 --> 20:24.491
in a real extended family.

20:24.524 --> 20:27.193
Ah, I never thought
about it like that.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.329
Darlene, it's
going to be so great.

20:29.362 --> 20:30.663
It's very natural.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.365
It's like throughout history.

20:32.399 --> 20:33.766
That's how every child grew up.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.935
You know, there wasn't
daycare or babysitters.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.670
It was just the family.

20:37.704 --> 20:39.372
It's perfect.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.908
You should tell your parents
how grateful we really are.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.643
Well, I'll do it.
You tend to gush.

20:47.013 --> 20:50.750
Besides, I'm not sure they're
crazy about this whole idea

20:50.783 --> 20:51.751
in the first place.

20:51.784 --> 20:52.719
What are you talking about?

20:52.752 --> 20:54.521
They love having
us here at home.

20:54.554 --> 20:55.688
I mean, I thought they did.

20:55.722 --> 20:57.123
But then I talked to my mom.

20:57.156 --> 20:59.191
And I got this weird
feeling that they don't want

20:59.225 --> 21:01.394
us around here for too long.

21:01.428 --> 21:02.529
Maybe they just meant you.

21:09.302 --> 21:11.571
No, David.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.905
It's just my mom.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.542
You know, she's usually like
so direct about everything.

21:15.575 --> 21:16.676
Or haven't you noticed?

21:16.709 --> 21:19.979
No, I noticed.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.714
Well, so I just think
if she wanted us to stay

21:21.748 --> 21:24.050
for an extended period of
time, she would have said,

21:24.083 --> 21:26.719
stay for an extended
period of time.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.388
Of course, she would
use shorter words.

21:31.358 --> 21:33.092
So what does this mean?

21:33.125 --> 21:34.627
It means I think
that we should get

21:34.661 --> 21:36.829
out of here as soon as we can.

21:36.863 --> 21:39.632
[baby crying]

21:39.666 --> 21:41.233
I should go with
the baby upstairs.

21:41.267 --> 21:53.145
[music playing]

21:54.146 --> 21:55.615
[tone]
