00:01.160 --> 00:02.639
'Previously on Camelot...'

00:02.760 --> 00:04.352
(Merlin) 'The legend's clear.

00:04.480 --> 00:06.277
'Whoever pulls the sword from that rock

00:06.400 --> 00:08.516
'shall be the king to unite all of Britain.'

00:08.640 --> 00:12.997
I present to you
your undoubted King.

00:14.120 --> 00:15.997
And every king needs his champions.

00:16.120 --> 00:19.999
So, I call upon Leontes,
to whom I owe my life.

00:20.120 --> 00:23.715
(Arthur) I had a dream,
maybe a vision, of you.

00:23.840 --> 00:26.274
Guinevere, this is the amazing Leontes.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.960
Actually, we've known each other
a very long time.

00:29.080 --> 00:30.752
This is my betrothed.

00:30.880 --> 00:32.359
I am.

00:32.479 --> 00:34.596
(Morgan) 'I'm Uther's daughter
and sole heir.

00:34.720 --> 00:36.551
'This castle and realm should be mine.'

00:36.680 --> 00:40.355
We don't need to be opposed.
We can work together.

00:40.480 --> 00:41.913
For you, this is nothing.

00:42.040 --> 00:44.474
For me, everything.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.152
No more than six guards.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.999
Paltry defences. It's perfect.

02:30.120 --> 02:32.714
These are easy pickings.
Come on!

02:40.560 --> 02:44.519
I just said, I don't understand
the rush to get married.

02:44.640 --> 02:46.790
You've been sweethearts
since you were children

02:46.920 --> 02:48.990
and engaged for five years.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.076
I don't call that a rush.

02:52.360 --> 02:56.069
Bridget, what if he isn't the one?

02:56.200 --> 02:58.794
You're getting married in three days.

02:58.920 --> 03:00.751
You're just having a wobble.

03:00.880 --> 03:04.190
Listen, good men
aren't just rare right now,

03:04.320 --> 03:06.788
they're practically nonexistent.

03:08.320 --> 03:11.392
Leontes is young, good-looking,

03:11.520 --> 03:14.273
and the king's champion,
for goodness sake.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.997
He's a good union

03:17.120 --> 03:19.111
and he'll protect your father's land.

03:20.360 --> 03:21.839
But most of all,

03:21.960 --> 03:23.996
he's the one your mother
always wanted for you.

03:25.360 --> 03:26.759
I've told Leontes,

03:27.840 --> 03:29.990
wherever we go,

03:30.120 --> 03:32.395
I want you with me.

03:32.520 --> 03:34.954
You're not just my cousin.

03:35.080 --> 03:37.674
You're my closest friend.

03:37.800 --> 03:38.789
Guinevere.

03:38.920 --> 03:41.115
- Father, do you mind?
- We must leave here.

03:41.240 --> 03:44.869
We are being attacked.
Come on, we must leave.

03:49.840 --> 03:52.752
Father, stop them.
We can't just let them do this.

03:53.760 --> 03:56.513
- This is no time to argue.
- Put those things down!

03:59.120 --> 04:01.680
Guinevere, you can't fight them.
There are too many of them.

04:01.800 --> 04:02.835
Please come now.

04:03.800 --> 04:05.995
- (Father) Guinevere, now!
- We can't just leave.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.559
(Bandit) Leave before I hurt you.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.069
(Father) Let's go.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.750
What are all these people doing here?

04:28.680 --> 04:30.113
What do they want?

04:30.240 --> 04:32.595
Favours from the new King.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.229
Might I have a moment
to beg your indulgence.

04:38.360 --> 04:39.759
- Sorry.
- I'm in dire need, sire.

04:41.480 --> 04:44.552
- Just a moment of your time.
- Wrong brother. It's him you want.

04:44.680 --> 04:47.752
- Your Highness.
- I'll be with you soon, or someone will.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.279
I promise.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.915
The word has spread.
The people are flocking. It's good.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.270
- Your Highness.
- Leontes, what's wrong?

05:16.520 --> 05:17.919
My love.

05:26.520 --> 05:29.114
- What's happened?
- Bandits attacked us, your Highness.

05:29.240 --> 05:32.471
They took everything. We can't
go back there. It's not safe.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.672
Can we give them sanctuary here,
find them rooms? I'll vouch for them.

05:35.800 --> 05:39.076
- No, this isn't a lodge.
- Of course.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.636
Choose any room.
They won't be comfortable.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.955
But you'll be safe here.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.149
Thank you.

05:48.520 --> 05:52.354
There will be no wedding now.
Just when she needed your protection.

05:53.320 --> 05:56.073
- You're due to be married?
- In three days.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.679
- Then it must be here.
- What?

05:57.800 --> 05:59.631
- No.
- Why not?

05:59.760 --> 06:01.955
- You didn't want them to stay.
- I changed my mind.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.594
Nothing says hope like a wedding.

06:04.720 --> 06:06.756
The marriage of the king's champion.

06:06.880 --> 06:10.350
A perfect symbol,
unless you object, your Highness?

06:14.760 --> 06:16.352
Of course not.

06:17.280 --> 06:18.679
Thank you.

06:24.360 --> 06:27.909
Your daughter and Leontes
shall marry here at Camelot.

06:28.040 --> 06:29.837
You're very kind.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.232
Break the lock.

07:10.040 --> 07:13.396
So this is where
Uther tortured his prisoners.

07:17.680 --> 07:19.432
Did you bring prisoners here?

07:22.800 --> 07:25.553
(Woman) Not just prisoners.

07:28.720 --> 07:31.393
Anyone who crossed him.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.792
Leave us.

07:40.320 --> 07:41.719
What's your name?

07:44.080 --> 07:46.116
Vivian.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.992
Come here.

07:50.520 --> 07:53.432
- Did you serve my father?
- Yes.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.036
Where did you get these markings?

08:02.120 --> 08:04.793
The Romans brought
my family here as slaves,

08:05.880 --> 08:07.871
hundreds of years ago.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.116
I was told that when the empire fell,

08:10.240 --> 08:11.878
we stayed.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.871
The markings are from our homeland.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.831
Tell me what you thought of Uther.

08:18.320 --> 08:19.912
I respected your father.

08:20.040 --> 08:21.234
Did you like him?

08:23.560 --> 08:24.913
Did you fear him?

08:27.680 --> 08:29.636
I respected your father.

08:38.080 --> 08:39.717
I want you to do something for me.

08:41.440 --> 08:42.839
Go through the staff.

08:42.960 --> 08:45.952
Everyone you trust, keep.
Anyone you don't, get rid of.

08:47.400 --> 08:50.710
- All right.
- This castle needs new air.

08:50.840 --> 08:53.513
More women would be good.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.397
But first have this room cleared.

08:57.840 --> 08:59.637
Except for those.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.356
(Igraine) The chambers are
in a poor state now.

09:10.480 --> 09:12.232
It will take a little work
to improve them.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.669
There.

09:15.760 --> 09:19.309
Forgive me for asking,
but where are all the servants?

09:19.440 --> 09:21.874
Who do we talk to
about the preparations?

09:23.640 --> 09:25.437
Well...

09:26.520 --> 09:28.511
There aren't exactly any...

09:28.640 --> 09:30.949
Just us, then.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.871
Right.

09:34.000 --> 09:34.989
Good.

09:36.120 --> 09:37.269
OK.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.197
You are what we need.

09:39.320 --> 09:41.595
The first wedding of Camelot.

09:41.720 --> 09:44.439
I am going to make you
a bride worthy of legend.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.478
- You're going to make me blush.
- You've done well.

09:48.600 --> 09:51.717
- Leontes is an excellent match.
- That's what I keep telling her.

09:51.840 --> 09:54.877
- And he has the King's favour.
- I know.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.797
I couldn't ask for anyone better.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.198
Here, come.

10:06.120 --> 10:07.712
Do you love him?

10:10.400 --> 10:13.631
I'm not sure I even know
what that word means.

10:13.760 --> 10:16.274
That's all right. I was the same.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.031
But, you know,

10:19.160 --> 10:21.594
with a little luck, in time,

10:21.720 --> 10:24.075
you might fall in love with him.

10:24.960 --> 10:29.511
And if you don't, before you know it,
he'll give you children and then...

10:29.640 --> 10:31.949
...you'll love them.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.791
Hardly an army fit for a king.

10:42.760 --> 10:45.228
We lost a lot of good men
during the fight with Lot.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.196
Sooner or later
others are going to come.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.719
Right now, we're vulnerable.

10:49.840 --> 10:53.628
If we recruit an exceptional warrior,
it would boost our morale.

10:53.760 --> 10:56.035
With a bit of luck,
everyone will hear about it and come.

10:56.160 --> 10:58.674
- Anyone spring to mind?
- Maybe.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.916
Gawain, a warrior I fought against once.

11:01.040 --> 11:04.077
I tried to recruit him to Uther's men
but he refused.

11:04.200 --> 11:06.111
What makes you think
we'd get him this time?

11:06.240 --> 11:07.639
This is different.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.910
Or so you keep telling me.
No harm in asking.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.232
Can I help you?

11:20.360 --> 11:21.873
I'm here for the King only.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.951
His sister sends a message.

11:45.760 --> 11:48.433
Your sister and ally invites you
to visit your father's castle.

11:48.560 --> 11:51.028
She's planning a feast in your honour.

11:55.480 --> 11:56.879
Such hospitality.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.189
Why?

12:05.320 --> 12:07.788
I only relay what I am told.

12:07.920 --> 12:11.515
Then we accept.
We'll ride out immediately.

12:11.640 --> 12:13.517
She'll be delighted.

12:16.360 --> 12:19.989
You don't accept anything
without conferring with me.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.678
I am the King

12:21.800 --> 12:24.030
and I made a decision.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.310
I think there's quite enough
to be doing here.

12:27.320 --> 12:28.719
Like hosting a wedding?

12:28.840 --> 12:32.230
Morgan's my sister.
I want to get to know her better.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.839
If I can't unite my family,
how am I going to unite the country?

12:41.280 --> 12:44.078
- So, where do we find this warrior?
- The last I heard of him,

12:44.200 --> 12:46.270
he was a day's ride from here.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.317
I see the way you look at her.

13:12.640 --> 13:14.039
Guinevere.

13:15.480 --> 13:16.879
Leontes' Guinevere?

13:18.840 --> 13:20.239
You dreamt of her.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.992
No, I didn't.

13:24.120 --> 13:25.553
Don't lie to me.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.477
Have you met her before today?

13:27.600 --> 13:29.989
At the coronation, that's all.

13:33.840 --> 13:35.159
Nowhere else?

13:35.280 --> 13:37.157
No.

13:37.280 --> 13:39.236
Not on a beach.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.952
Why do you think
I met her on a beach?

13:41.080 --> 13:42.479
Because I saw it.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.639
It was a dream.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.318
I had a dream of her, nothing else.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.317
Good, because she belongs to Leontes.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.192
Nobody belongs to anyone.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.993
And nothing jeopardises our work here,

13:56.120 --> 13:57.712
Ieast of all a woman.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.990
You have no right
to talk to me like that.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.788
Everything you are right now
is because of me.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.199
Remember that.

14:46.640 --> 14:48.073
Your Highness.

14:48.200 --> 14:49.599
I'm honoured.

14:51.080 --> 14:52.069
Thank you.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.391
You have made changes.

15:18.520 --> 15:22.069
Yes, it needed a woman's touch.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.713
Come on.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.149
I'm sure you'd like
to relax before dinner.

15:26.280 --> 15:30.034
Vivian will look after you
and show you to your chambers.

15:32.760 --> 15:35.320
Merlin, you're with me.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.317
I'm so glad you accepted my invitation.

15:41.160 --> 15:42.878
I didn't. Arthur did.

15:43.720 --> 15:47.599
- You can't let the boy out of your sight?
- It's my job to protect him.

15:47.720 --> 15:51.030
- I simply want to know him.
- The crown is his now.

15:51.160 --> 15:52.559
I understand that.

15:52.680 --> 15:55.194
So you've abandoned
your claim entirely?

15:57.160 --> 16:00.118
Here you are. Your old room.

16:01.160 --> 16:04.391
From when you were Uther's lackey.

16:18.720 --> 16:19.709
Impressive.

16:21.360 --> 16:23.476
Why don't we have meals like this?

16:30.960 --> 16:32.359
Thank you, Vivian.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.392
Ah!

16:58.920 --> 17:00.319
If I wanted to poison you,

17:00.440 --> 17:02.829
I wouldn't do it
by wasting good quail soup.

17:06.119 --> 17:09.396
So, Arthur,
now that you have the crown,

17:09.520 --> 17:11.112
what will you do with it?

17:11.240 --> 17:13.117
That's a good question.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.117
Then dazzle me with a good answer.

17:17.359 --> 17:20.511
"The first duty of a man and of a king

17:20.640 --> 17:23.358
"is the seeking after
and the investigation of truth."

17:23.480 --> 17:25.516
- Cicero.
- That's right.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.520
He's been a good student.

17:29.640 --> 17:32.996
But how do you apply
that principle in practice?

17:33.120 --> 17:36.396
Before I make too many decisions,
I must get to know my kingdom.

17:37.840 --> 17:41.469
- Get to know its people.
- And they must get to know you.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.673
I didn't know you were there.

18:03.520 --> 18:06.557
- That was quite a feast you gave us.
- I wanted to spend time with you.

18:09.760 --> 18:12.069
I've had a lot to eat and drink.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.154
- I can't promise I'll be awake for long.
- Men seldom are.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.391
Is this the room
our father used to sleep in?

18:23.520 --> 18:25.112
Yes, with my mother.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.872
When I was very little.

18:29.160 --> 18:30.957
Tell me about him.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.672
He...

18:34.800 --> 18:37.360
He was a great warrior.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.789
He could be kind,

18:39.920 --> 18:42.639
but he could also be cruel,

18:42.760 --> 18:44.432
extremely cruel.

18:45.760 --> 18:48.035
I know my arrival was difficult for you.

18:49.160 --> 18:52.630
But I'm glad that
we got to start again tonight.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.709
Glad we could get
to know each other properly.

18:56.840 --> 18:57.829
Yes.

18:59.560 --> 19:01.312
It's just, I really don't know you.

19:03.120 --> 19:05.634
Who are you? I can't really tell.

19:06.600 --> 19:07.999
Ask me anything.

19:10.640 --> 19:12.517
Were you ever told
you were the son of a king?

19:12.640 --> 19:13.914
No.

19:14.960 --> 19:15.949
Honestly.

19:16.080 --> 19:20.073
Until Merlin arrived just after
our father's death, I knew nothing.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.633
You knew nothing.

19:21.760 --> 19:22.875
Yes.

19:25.440 --> 19:28.034
And now? What do you hope for?

19:28.160 --> 19:30.435
- What's in there?
- (Groans)

19:30.560 --> 19:31.629
I'm so sorry.

19:31.760 --> 19:34.274
- Did I hurt you?
- No.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.516
No, it's fine.

19:36.640 --> 19:39.154
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd quite like to pass out.

19:40.360 --> 19:41.759
Of course.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.760
Sleep well, your Highness.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.199
Just Arthur.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.469
Yes.

19:49.680 --> 19:51.113
Just Arthur.

20:04.440 --> 20:07.716
(Kay) So your fearless warrior
lives in this burnt-out church?

20:08.840 --> 20:10.558
(Leontes) This is the place. Has to be.

20:10.680 --> 20:13.797
- (Kay) Are you certain?
- Let's find out. Come on.

20:53.360 --> 20:54.395
Hello?

21:11.640 --> 21:13.232
Your King requires your service.

21:13.360 --> 21:15.794
- I don't recognise any king.
- Well, he recognises you.

21:17.240 --> 21:18.878
And he demands your loyalty.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.471
You. I've told you before.
I'm not interested in serving Uther.

21:23.600 --> 21:26.114
I thought you said he was good.
He's not that good.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.197
Camelot's got plenty as good as him.

21:29.320 --> 21:31.311
- Who's Camelot?
- It's not a who. It's a place.

21:31.440 --> 21:33.510
It's from where King Arthur
rules the country.

21:33.640 --> 21:36.677
- Not my bit, he doesn't.
- You don't know anything about him.

21:36.800 --> 21:39.109
Hardly surprising,
if you shut yourself away here.

21:39.240 --> 21:41.117
So he's a warlord
who thinks he's a king.

21:42.400 --> 21:43.992
I'm not interested.

21:45.960 --> 21:48.599
- He's from Uther's bloodline.
- That's nothing to be proud of.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.597
He pulled the Sword of Mars
from the waterfall.

21:50.720 --> 21:54.918
- What do you want me to do? Cheer?
- He vanquished King Lot.

21:58.720 --> 22:00.551
Lot's dead?

22:00.680 --> 22:02.079
What do you want with me?

22:02.200 --> 22:05.272
We need a strong warrior
to return with us to help train others.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.832
We came from the coast
to look for you.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.837
Then you wasted your time.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.069
Obviously.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.277
(Thunder rumbling)

22:17.760 --> 22:21.036
- We're going to have to sleep here.
- Not unless you pay me.

22:21.160 --> 22:23.549
This is what's happened to you?

22:23.680 --> 22:26.478
From a respected warrior
to demanding payment for lodging?

22:26.600 --> 22:28.830
There's nothing worth fighting for
any more.

22:29.760 --> 22:33.116
- I take money where I can get it.
- This is the Lord's dwelling.

22:33.240 --> 22:35.674
And this grants me access.

22:37.840 --> 22:42.470
Fine.
But come first light, you leave.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.996
- (Arthur) 'What is your name?'
- 'It's Guinevere.'

23:45.320 --> 23:47.390
He was so proud of that kill.

23:50.360 --> 23:53.670
The stag refused to die for a long time.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.394
Uther loved to fight.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.238
I remember.

23:59.160 --> 24:03.392
The wounded deer jumps highest,
strives the hardest.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.912
I'm not a wounded deer, Merlin.

24:10.600 --> 24:12.238
And I'm not a king's trophy.

24:13.360 --> 24:15.112
Good. Let's drink to that.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.997
Do you remember me as a child?

24:28.920 --> 24:30.353
No.

24:30.480 --> 24:32.311
I remember you.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.596
You came once when my father was ill.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.278
You cured him.

24:38.400 --> 24:40.630
I've cured many.

24:40.760 --> 24:42.671
I adored you for that.

24:44.040 --> 24:46.679
I told him that when I grew up,
I'd marry you.

24:47.560 --> 24:49.994
- And do you know what he said?
- No.

24:51.120 --> 24:55.159
He said, "Marry Merlin
and everything will be yours,

24:56.600 --> 24:59.114
"except your soul."

24:59.240 --> 25:02.357
(Chuckles)

25:02.480 --> 25:03.879
A little harsh.

25:28.840 --> 25:29.829
(Merlin gasps)

25:58.320 --> 26:00.276
I can smell you, Merlin.

26:05.920 --> 26:07.319
(Growling)

26:30.600 --> 26:31.715
Oh.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.239
(Grunts)

26:33.360 --> 26:35.510
It was you. I should have known.

26:35.640 --> 26:38.518
The wine. The wine!

27:14.960 --> 27:15.995
Arthur?

27:17.680 --> 27:20.240
You can't be in here.
Don't do this.

27:20.360 --> 27:23.955
I have to see you.
I have to talk to you.

27:24.080 --> 27:27.755
- I can't.
- Tell me you're not thinking of me,

27:27.880 --> 27:29.598
and I'll leave you alone.

27:30.840 --> 27:32.432
Meet me at the beach.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.389
- I don't know if I can.
- I'll wait for you.

27:36.520 --> 27:38.078
If I'm not there...

27:38.200 --> 27:40.111
I'll wait for you.

28:22.120 --> 28:23.155
(Winces)

28:32.280 --> 28:33.554
Get off me!

28:37.840 --> 28:39.034
Where's Arthur?

28:42.040 --> 28:43.268
Arthur!

28:44.720 --> 28:46.153
Let me go.

28:46.280 --> 28:48.157
Do you always wake
in such a bad mood?

28:51.520 --> 28:55.559
- What are you taking?
- Just a few toenails.

28:57.320 --> 29:00.232
And I trimmed your beard.
You were looking dishevelled.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.191
- Where's Arthur?
- Gone.

29:03.160 --> 29:06.436
- He left in the night.
- Why are you holding me?

29:06.560 --> 29:09.518
I'm worried for my brother.
You may be dangerous.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.308
I'm dangerous?

29:15.680 --> 29:17.477
I saw what you did to Uther.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.397
(Tuts)

29:20.360 --> 29:22.669
You murdered your own father.

29:22.800 --> 29:25.030
Father? Ha!

29:25.160 --> 29:27.754
He never deserved
to be called a father.

29:27.880 --> 29:30.713
Fathers don't do to their daughters
what Uther did to me.

29:30.840 --> 29:32.717
(Mocking) What did he do to you,
Morgan?

29:34.920 --> 29:37.593
He made me strong,
and for that I'm grateful.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.031
What you can do,

29:42.160 --> 29:45.232
this power you've learned,

29:46.480 --> 29:48.391
that doesn't make you strong.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.511
It hurts you.

29:50.640 --> 29:54.189
- It costs.
- Don't try and frighten me, Merlin.

29:54.320 --> 29:56.595
It's true.

29:56.720 --> 29:59.473
Oh, you're in its grip even now.

30:01.320 --> 30:05.199
You don't realise it, but you've never
been more vulnerable in your life.

30:05.320 --> 30:07.117
I'm not the one tied up here, am l?

30:07.240 --> 30:09.595
- Oh, you think I can't free myself?
- Then do it.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.392
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't perform tricks.

30:11.520 --> 30:15.149
- Because you can't.
- I'm strong enough to choose not to.

30:15.280 --> 30:16.998
It would be stronger
to choose to do it.

30:17.120 --> 30:19.156
To do it at will?
Is that what you can do?

30:19.280 --> 30:21.236
- Yes.
- Show me.

30:22.960 --> 30:24.951
Show me what you can do.

30:30.960 --> 30:32.916
(Groans)

30:38.600 --> 30:40.192
(Wailing)

31:00.560 --> 31:03.597
- That's you.
- (Giggles)

31:03.720 --> 31:05.790
That's you as a child.

31:05.920 --> 31:07.797
(Laughs)

31:10.960 --> 31:11.949
Enough!

31:14.320 --> 31:17.437
(Screaming)

31:36.400 --> 31:38.391
The price will be too high.

31:39.680 --> 31:42.399
No, not too high at all.

31:42.520 --> 31:43.999
Let me go.

31:45.200 --> 31:48.192
Untie me. Morgan.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.039
Morgan!

31:54.960 --> 31:56.473
Morgan!

32:16.280 --> 32:17.679
Don't marry him.

32:18.840 --> 32:21.752
- Don't be ridiculous.
- He's not right for you.

32:21.880 --> 32:24.348
- You don't even know me.
- There was something between us.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.470
At the coronation.

32:28.600 --> 32:31.717
And here, when we met.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.199
I didn't feel it.

32:34.320 --> 32:37.551
- Stop denying it.
- What do you want me to say?

32:37.680 --> 32:39.671
That there could be
something between us.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.078
- I'm getting married.
- Don't.

32:47.640 --> 32:49.358
Are you asking me as my King?

32:51.120 --> 32:53.714
Or as a complete stranger
who's only met me twice

32:53.840 --> 32:55.398
who has decided
he can order me about?

32:55.520 --> 32:57.909
If you don't feel the same way,
then why did you come?

33:05.520 --> 33:07.078
To ask you to stop.

33:11.560 --> 33:13.357
You could have said that at Camelot.

33:14.680 --> 33:15.669
You came...

33:17.120 --> 33:18.917
...because you wanted this, too.

33:21.560 --> 33:22.549
No.

33:26.200 --> 33:27.599
Maybe.

33:42.760 --> 33:44.159
Again.

34:04.120 --> 34:05.519
Stop.

34:08.040 --> 34:09.029
He'll know.

34:41.360 --> 34:43.078
(Sobbing)

34:48.280 --> 34:50.271
Why are you crying?

34:51.159 --> 34:53.150
Because I want this.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.718
Just once.

35:04.560 --> 35:06.152
Just once.

35:12.840 --> 35:13.829
Just once.

35:13.960 --> 35:15.712
Just once.

35:48.800 --> 35:50.313
You get away from that stuff.

35:52.160 --> 35:55.550
- Marcus Aurelius.
- You've read it?

35:56.960 --> 35:58.712
One of the great philosopher kings.

36:00.560 --> 36:01.959
I'm...

36:03.480 --> 36:06.199
-...struggling a little.
- Where are you up to?

36:16.760 --> 36:19.513
"From the reputation
and remembrance of my father,

36:19.640 --> 36:21.631
"l learned modesty
and a manly character.

36:22.800 --> 36:26.395
"And from my brother Severus,
I learned to love my kin

36:26.520 --> 36:28.829
"and to love truth and justice."

36:28.960 --> 36:30.552
You're very good.

36:33.760 --> 36:36.638
- Who taught you?
- My father.

36:38.440 --> 36:39.839
What about you?

36:42.480 --> 36:43.879
I'm teaching myself.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.558
That's quite a task.

36:45.680 --> 36:47.398
So why bother?

36:52.040 --> 36:53.439
To be better.

36:59.280 --> 37:01.236
You were right about him.

37:01.360 --> 37:03.590
He'd be perfect.

37:03.720 --> 37:05.517
If only he knew it.

37:13.120 --> 37:16.510
If I did come, one condition.

37:19.240 --> 37:22.391
Teach me how to read this book.

37:22.520 --> 37:26.479
By the time we're finished at Camelot,
you'll be ready to write a book.

37:36.640 --> 37:39.552
It's over. This was it.

37:40.280 --> 37:41.679
The once.

37:44.760 --> 37:46.751
Now we must never talk of it.

37:57.240 --> 37:59.071
He must never know.

38:04.360 --> 38:07.158
I have to get ready for my wedding.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.468
Yes, put one here
and just put one there.

38:23.600 --> 38:25.636
(Servant) I need some help here.

38:25.760 --> 38:27.751
Oh, I need you to switch.

38:30.320 --> 38:31.833
(Servant) Higher.

38:31.960 --> 38:33.791
Take it up a bit more.

38:34.920 --> 38:37.309
Are you going to put that up?

38:39.360 --> 38:41.032
Oh, yes, higher,

38:41.160 --> 38:43.594
And a little bit higher? Stop.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.599
He'll know.

38:47.720 --> 38:49.915
Tonight Leontes will know.

38:50.800 --> 38:52.791
What am I going to do?

38:53.720 --> 38:56.359
We have to fix this.
Leontes is a good man.

38:56.480 --> 38:57.879
I know.

39:04.160 --> 39:05.559
Oh, my God.

39:23.560 --> 39:25.790
- Give me the knife.
- It's already dead.

39:25.920 --> 39:27.558
We can make it right.

39:32.440 --> 39:35.557
- Get me the wine sack.
- What are you going to do?

39:35.680 --> 39:37.591
We have to get back.

40:04.760 --> 40:06.273
(Grunts)

40:19.440 --> 40:20.839
You're leaving?

40:29.560 --> 40:33.189
What you showed me,
is that all you've learnt?

40:33.320 --> 40:34.799
For now.

40:38.160 --> 40:40.549
You don't understand
the forces you're messing with.

40:41.640 --> 40:44.712
I do.
You won't get what you want.

40:45.800 --> 40:49.634
We'll just have to wait and see.
I've learned to be patient.

40:52.200 --> 40:55.317
Tell the King
he has a home here. Always.

40:55.440 --> 40:56.429
(Groans)

40:58.120 --> 40:59.712
Morgan. Morgan?

41:03.080 --> 41:06.675
May your health and judgment
return promptly.

41:07.680 --> 41:09.432
Open the gates!

41:22.680 --> 41:27.800
Last night of freedom, Leontes.
You'll soon be a married man!

41:27.920 --> 41:29.433
No, no!

41:29.560 --> 41:31.676
(Shouts and laughter)

41:38.320 --> 41:40.072
No. Put me down. No!

41:40.200 --> 41:41.599
(Shouting)

41:43.520 --> 41:46.478
- Gawain.
- Arthur.

41:49.600 --> 41:52.319
Apparently, I work for you now.

41:53.840 --> 41:55.319
Here we go.

41:55.440 --> 41:56.998
(Shouting)

42:07.200 --> 42:10.317
A messenger brought this.
Didn't say who it was from.

42:10.440 --> 42:12.158
- Do you want to open it now?
- Yes.

42:16.160 --> 42:17.673
(Gasps)

42:17.800 --> 42:19.597
Oh, that is so beautiful.

42:21.200 --> 42:23.430
We should put it on a ribbon
so that you can wear it.

42:33.160 --> 42:35.151
(§ Pipes playing)

42:55.760 --> 42:57.159
Your Highness.

43:00.640 --> 43:02.039
Your Highness.

43:15.880 --> 43:19.668
Arthur, your Highness,
there's something I wanted to ask you.

43:21.160 --> 43:24.948
Will you preside over our ceremony?
I've arranged for an elder to do it

43:25.080 --> 43:27.435
but it would mean so much more
if the King would honour us.

43:27.560 --> 43:29.516
Of course.

43:31.160 --> 43:32.275
Thank you.

43:32.400 --> 43:33.833
(Applause)

45:28.680 --> 45:31.956
Let's see
what's truly in your heart, Brother.

46:37.800 --> 46:40.268
May these rings stand forever

46:41.800 --> 46:46.430
as a symbol of your unity and fidelity.

46:46.560 --> 46:49.233
May you live and grow old together,

46:50.200 --> 46:52.077
knowing only the truth...

46:53.600 --> 46:56.319
...of undying love.

47:45.720 --> 47:47.438
By witness of all of those present,

47:48.960 --> 47:50.359
I confirm you...

47:52.400 --> 47:53.799
...as man and wife.

48:10.800 --> 48:13.109
