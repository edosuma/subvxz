00:43.000 --> 00:44.991
Since the dawn
of recorded history,

00:45.169 --> 00:49.663
something like 110 billion human beings
have been born into this world.

00:50.875 --> 00:53.207
And not a single one of them made it.

00:54.378 --> 00:57.175
There are 6.8 billion people on the planet.

00:57.414 --> 01:01.714
Roughly 60 million of them die
every year. 60 million people.

01:01.818 --> 01:05.275
That comes out to about 160,000 per day.

01:05.989 --> 01:08.048
I read this quote once when I was a kid,

01:08.158 --> 01:12.595
"We live alone, we die alone.
Everything else is just an illusion."

01:12.963 --> 01:14.931
It used to keep me up at night.

01:15.732 --> 01:17.563
We all die alone.

01:18.668 --> 01:22.728
So, why am I supposed to spend my life
working, sweating, struggling?

01:23.072 --> 01:24.061
For an illusion?

01:25.508 --> 01:27.032
Because no amount of friends,

01:27.576 --> 01:29.066
no girl,

01:29.311 --> 01:32.075
no assignments
about conjugating the pluperfect

01:32.181 --> 01:35.014
or determining the square root
of the hypotenuse

01:35.117 --> 01:37.017
is gonna help me avoid my fate.

01:38.988 --> 01:40.649
I have better things to do with my time.

02:04.779 --> 02:07.839
I've got a cupboard with cans of food

02:08.716 --> 02:11.651
Filtered water and pictures of you

02:12.120 --> 02:15.748
And I'm not coming out until this is all over

02:19.159 --> 02:22.185
And I'm looking through the glass

02:22.596 --> 02:25.656
Where the light bends at the cracks

02:26.600 --> 02:29.068
And I'm screaming at the top of my lungs

02:29.169 --> 02:34.539
Pretending the echoes belong to someone

02:39.479 --> 02:41.673
Someone I used to know

02:50.356 --> 02:53.086
And we become

02:56.829 --> 03:00.060
Silhouettes when our bodies finally go

03:21.753 --> 03:23.414
Do you have your work, George?

03:23.888 --> 03:25.651
- No.
- Why not?

03:26.791 --> 03:28.622
I was depressed.

03:28.727 --> 03:30.957
Oh, yes? Why was that?

03:31.763 --> 03:35.630
Because I realized I'm gonna die one day.

03:35.733 --> 03:38.099
We're all gonna die one day, George.

03:38.202 --> 03:40.170
I don't think that's a reasonable excuse

03:40.270 --> 03:43.103
for not completing
your trigonometry exercise.

03:43.207 --> 03:44.868
Well, I was trying to.

03:45.042 --> 03:48.011
I just couldn't shake
this awareness of my mortality.

03:49.013 --> 03:50.810
Everything seemed meaningless,

03:51.148 --> 03:53.673
including the assignment, unfortunately.

03:54.785 --> 03:56.616
I want you to go to the principal's office

03:56.720 --> 03:59.017
and find meaning in the homework.

03:59.155 --> 04:02.556
Bring it to me completed
by the end of the period.

04:20.442 --> 04:23.378
- You're late.
- I was so engrossed in my work.

04:24.013 --> 04:25.570
Boy, I wouldn't wanna be you right now.

04:25.681 --> 04:28.149
- I haven't done anything.
- You've always done something.

04:31.687 --> 04:33.587
You better go.

04:38.060 --> 04:39.254
Bill.

04:39.361 --> 04:43.058
Even though you have
off-campus privileges as a senior,

04:43.165 --> 04:46.396
if you are seen
anywhere in the city smoking,

04:46.501 --> 04:48.560
you have your privileges revoked.
Automatic probation.

04:49.071 --> 04:50.265
Why are you telling me?

04:51.005 --> 04:53.940
- You think I can't smell?
- You can smell all you want.

04:54.742 --> 04:56.676
Shall we get down to business?

04:58.145 --> 04:59.134
Yes, we shall.

04:59.947 --> 05:04.281
In a way, your future depends
on the next few months.

05:04.385 --> 05:05.374
Not just for college.

05:05.486 --> 05:08.421
I mean, it sets the tone
for everything that follows.

05:09.223 --> 05:10.656
Now, I know how you think and I know

05:10.758 --> 05:13.318
you're thinking it's too late
and you're gonna be a fatalist

05:13.427 --> 05:14.826
and let it all go to hell.

05:15.496 --> 05:17.292
But, George, if you keep performing
the way you are,

05:17.397 --> 05:21.333
forget about college,
forget about graduating, even.

05:22.836 --> 05:23.825
So,

05:24.771 --> 05:27.535
this counts as your official warning.
Suspension is next.

05:28.608 --> 05:29.939
I thought probation was next.

05:31.845 --> 05:34.405
Don't play the angles, George.
They won't work.

05:35.014 --> 05:36.641
Neither do jokes.

05:36.750 --> 05:37.739
I wasn't joking.

05:39.018 --> 05:41.043
I know you're capable.

05:42.489 --> 05:46.447
I have a real problem with motivating.

05:47.926 --> 05:49.621
But I think I can do it.

05:49.728 --> 05:51.286
I'll try.

05:52.965 --> 05:54.489
All right, go.

05:56.835 --> 05:58.826
And don't make me regret it.

06:29.700 --> 06:31.258
Who's smoking up here?

06:32.904 --> 06:34.894
George! What do you think you're doing?

06:37.174 --> 06:38.607
Sorry. I...

06:39.409 --> 06:40.808
I was having a tough day.

06:40.911 --> 06:42.970
I guess the stress finally got to me,
Mrs. Dougherty.

06:43.079 --> 06:45.309
George, why do you do these things?

06:46.817 --> 06:48.045
Thank you.

06:48.185 --> 06:50.847
Now, what do you mean by stress?

07:08.270 --> 07:10.397
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:11.974 --> 07:15.109
- I got an e-mail from your school.
- Oh, Jesus.

07:16.612 --> 07:18.944
Some kind of academic probation?

07:20.182 --> 07:21.877
Can I help you?

07:21.984 --> 07:26.546
Can I get you a tutor
or a private college advisor?

07:27.355 --> 07:31.018
If you don't get into a decent school,

07:31.125 --> 07:33.992
then I don't know
how you're gonna get a job.

07:34.095 --> 07:35.619
I have it under control.

07:36.664 --> 07:40.361
Honey, if you don't get into
a decent college...

07:40.468 --> 07:43.926
- I'm gonna go watch TV.
- No, you will not watch TV.

07:44.038 --> 07:45.266
You will stay here

07:45.373 --> 07:48.570
till we can come up with a plan
for getting you into college.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.405
I had a hard day at school, I'm tired,

07:50.511 --> 07:53.138
and I'm gonna go relax now
for half an hour.

07:55.015 --> 07:57.483
Then I will do my work. Okay?

08:06.760 --> 08:08.057
George?

08:11.231 --> 08:12.220
The fuck are you doing?

08:13.066 --> 08:14.556
I'm drawing.

08:14.701 --> 08:17.363
Are you sketching your subject,
you little shit?

08:17.604 --> 08:19.036
Yes.

08:24.877 --> 08:28.040
- I don't have a subject, Harris.
- Why the heck not?

08:28.681 --> 08:30.148
I don't know.

08:30.283 --> 08:32.876
George, you're going to have to start
digging around in there,

08:32.985 --> 08:35.010
so you can develop that talent of yours,

08:35.121 --> 08:37.419
so you can start to use that brain of yours

08:37.523 --> 08:39.787
to express that beautiful heart of yours.

08:41.092 --> 08:43.390
So, figure out what you want to say,
and say it.

08:44.563 --> 08:46.553
- Harris.
- Yes.

08:47.766 --> 08:49.495
I don't have anything to say.

08:51.670 --> 08:53.570
Find something!

09:03.315 --> 09:05.283
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:08.486 --> 09:11.147
- I'm Sally.
- I know.

09:11.255 --> 09:12.722
Thanks for covering for me.

09:12.823 --> 09:14.916
No problem.

09:15.559 --> 09:17.186
Why did you?

09:18.395 --> 09:19.919
I don't know.

09:20.097 --> 09:21.564
You were doing something so renegade,

09:21.665 --> 09:23.098
I thought you deserved to get away with it.

09:24.301 --> 09:26.030
I run afoul of the authorities so often,

09:26.136 --> 09:28.696
I figured I could handle it better than you.

09:30.174 --> 09:31.903
You're really weird.

09:36.046 --> 09:38.013
So, why don't you ever
do your work?

09:38.147 --> 09:40.172
There are so many more important things
to think about,

09:40.283 --> 09:42.717
homework ends up seeming like
an afterthought.

09:43.286 --> 09:44.913
ADD?

09:45.021 --> 09:46.852
No, they tried everything.

09:46.956 --> 09:49.720
Ritalin, Lexapro, tutors, therapy.

09:49.826 --> 09:52.624
Nothing worked. I'm the Teflon slacker.

09:53.663 --> 09:57.622
No, it's more like,
we're living in a dying time, you know?

09:57.734 --> 10:01.500
I mean, you got global warming, wars,
terrorism, tsunamis.

10:01.604 --> 10:04.663
- Okay...
- We're definitely on the downhill side.

10:04.940 --> 10:07.704
So, what are we working towards?
What's the point?

10:08.143 --> 10:11.442
I thought I had fears,
but they're pretty run-of-the-mill.

10:11.546 --> 10:13.446
- Pain, death.
- Not me.

10:14.149 --> 10:15.411
I fear life.

10:19.888 --> 10:21.378
Do you have any friends, George?

10:23.358 --> 10:25.349
I'm kind of a misanthrope.

10:26.361 --> 10:28.124
Not a choice, just a fact.

10:34.769 --> 10:36.168
Okay, handsome.

10:45.813 --> 10:47.940
Mom! Jesus!

10:48.249 --> 10:49.682
Hi, banana!

10:54.422 --> 10:56.082
You wanna come up?

10:59.392 --> 11:01.826
I'm sorry about that, chicken.
We had a really late night.

11:01.928 --> 11:04.954
I think we got home right before
you left for school.

11:07.467 --> 11:10.595
Mom, this is my new friend, George.

11:10.703 --> 11:12.068
- Well, George.
- Hello, Mrs. Howe.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.799
- What a genuine pleasure.
- Very nice to...

11:13.907 --> 11:14.999
Sally, do you know
where our stemware went?

11:15.108 --> 11:17.235
I'm drinking wine out of a tumbler.

11:17.777 --> 11:18.766
What do you want, George?

11:21.180 --> 11:23.205
And this was before
we left the sticks.

11:23.348 --> 11:25.373
So, I cock one eye, look down,

11:26.151 --> 11:29.279
expecting to see a giant water bug,

11:29.388 --> 11:31.083
or a water moccasin, or...

11:32.624 --> 11:35.718
Water something. Something I had to kill.

11:35.828 --> 11:38.023
But it was the pilot's hand!

11:38.130 --> 11:39.097
Oh!

11:41.033 --> 11:42.398
Ticklish, this one!

11:44.203 --> 11:45.636
Let me get you a paper towel.

11:46.071 --> 11:49.938
You know,
ticklish people make great lovers.

11:50.875 --> 11:53.002
Everything is erogenous.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.607
My God. She's amazing.

11:58.216 --> 11:59.808
Not if you're her daughter.

12:00.451 --> 12:02.009
How'd you end up in New York?

12:02.120 --> 12:06.420
My mom had me when she was 16.
My dad was a truck driver,

12:06.524 --> 12:08.788
and one day he took off
and never came back.

12:08.893 --> 12:10.360
And this was?

12:10.461 --> 12:13.055
Clarksburg. It's a small town in Tennessee.

12:14.097 --> 12:17.396
This rich guy from New York,
who owned a textile plant,

12:17.501 --> 12:23.133
started coming down, and it was like
we were castaways and he was the ship.

12:24.307 --> 12:25.899
But I ended up here,

12:26.009 --> 12:31.447
eight years old, new school,
new friends, fancy new clothes.

12:32.282 --> 12:33.840
My mom divorced him a year ago,

12:33.950 --> 12:37.010
and now she's back on the singles scene
with a vengeance.

12:41.023 --> 12:44.083
I do think I should
get some homework done, though.

12:45.895 --> 12:48.921
I should get going then.
Got work to do myself.

12:49.465 --> 12:50.898
Yeah, right.

12:58.674 --> 12:59.800
Thank you.

13:00.943 --> 13:02.103
Goodbye.

13:33.140 --> 13:34.539
It's not the first time it's happened.

13:34.641 --> 13:36.006
I know.

13:36.143 --> 13:38.611
But you never think it's gonna be
the people that it's gonna be.

13:38.712 --> 13:42.079
- They've been together for 15 years.
- I know. It's certainly ridiculous.

13:42.182 --> 13:44.548
- What happened to the electricity?
- Hi, sweetie.

13:44.651 --> 13:47.279
We got take-out
from the rotisserie chicken place.

13:47.387 --> 13:48.649
Grab a plate and join us.

13:48.755 --> 13:50.746
But the lights. What happened?

13:50.857 --> 13:54.224
It's my fault. I forgot to pay the bill.

13:54.328 --> 13:56.228
And it's no big deal.
They'll be on tomorrow.

13:58.864 --> 14:00.058
George, we're trying to turn

14:00.166 --> 14:02.066
this awkward little mix-up
into a fun experience.

14:02.168 --> 14:04.864
And if you can't get into
the spirit of adventure,

14:04.971 --> 14:08.338
then you can just do your own thing.
You don't have to stick around.

14:08.441 --> 14:10.238
I'm sorry, Jack. I can't use my laptop,

14:10.343 --> 14:12.243
much less get my assignments.

14:12.345 --> 14:15.940
So, go to the library or Starbucks.
Be resourceful.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.095
Does anyone have any ideas about

14:32.197 --> 14:36.395
which elements of the novel pinpoint it
as part of the Romantic movement?

14:39.371 --> 14:40.804
Anyone?

14:41.406 --> 14:42.430
George?

14:44.809 --> 14:46.276
George?

14:47.012 --> 14:48.001
Yeah?

14:49.114 --> 14:52.947
I was asking what conclusion you came to
in the exercise we're doing.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.617
Sorry. About what, again?

14:56.086 --> 14:57.553
About which elements of the novel

14:57.655 --> 15:00.021
pinpoint it
as part of the Romantic movement?

15:03.360 --> 15:04.520
Which novel?

15:09.099 --> 15:13.297
The Mayor of Casterbridge, George,
which, obviously, you didn't read.

15:13.404 --> 15:14.632
I loved it.

15:14.738 --> 15:17.137
Clearly. Anyone else?

15:17.473 --> 15:20.374
My favorite part of the book
is how the town's layout is described

15:20.476 --> 15:24.276
from the perspective of a bee traveling
from one side of town to the other.

15:25.348 --> 15:26.713
It's so visual.

15:27.550 --> 15:30.951
So, I guess what Hardy's doing
is aligning his point of view

15:31.054 --> 15:33.318
not with an all-seeing God
but with an insect,

15:33.423 --> 15:35.414
the tiniest, humblest creature in nature.

15:37.427 --> 15:39.088
Which is pretty Romantic.

15:42.130 --> 15:44.189
I think you just found
your term paper, George.

15:55.711 --> 15:56.837
George!

15:56.945 --> 15:57.912
Hi.

16:00.782 --> 16:03.046
- Come join us.
- Cool.

16:05.854 --> 16:07.344
You know Will and Zoe, right?

16:08.089 --> 16:10.649
Yeah, we're in math class together, right?

16:10.758 --> 16:12.555
You never have your homework.

16:12.660 --> 16:14.560
Right. Right, it's my shtick.

16:15.129 --> 16:18.098
- Hi, George.
- Hey, Zoe.

16:18.199 --> 16:19.632
Dude, what are you always drawing?

16:19.734 --> 16:22.567
He's like the mad artist,
just hunched over his books.

16:22.670 --> 16:24.262
He never listens to a word
the teacher says.

16:24.372 --> 16:27.170
- What, like you do?
- Can I see some of the shit you draw?

16:28.409 --> 16:30.343
Yeah, sure.

16:39.252 --> 16:40.651
You have issues.

16:41.154 --> 16:43.714
No. Dude, you're sensitive.

16:43.823 --> 16:45.290
The sensitive artiste.

16:45.692 --> 16:47.660
Could you draw something like this
for one of my parties?

16:47.761 --> 16:50.321
I'm throwing a huge one
at my brother's club on New Year's Eve.

16:50.430 --> 16:51.954
- You serious?
- Yeah.

16:52.065 --> 16:54.795
You know, we can blow it up,
make it a poster, invites, flyers.

16:55.335 --> 16:57.235
Yeah, that'd be great, right?

17:18.257 --> 17:20.748
- Hey, George. How are you?
- Fine.

17:21.226 --> 17:22.625
Well, what are you doing?

17:23.060 --> 17:24.618
Just finishing my trig assignment.

17:25.431 --> 17:26.988
Good man. That's what I like to hear.

17:48.486 --> 17:50.852
I've got 72 comps on my list alone.

17:51.155 --> 17:52.917
- Most of them are your friends.
- Yeah.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.124
And they're gonna be
the coolest people there.

17:55.258 --> 17:57.590
- Yeah, you're right.
- So don't question it.

17:57.694 --> 18:00.060
Besides, if I pull my people,
your whole operation goes under.

18:00.630 --> 18:02.689
- Will.
- Brother George!

18:05.101 --> 18:06.466
I love it, man.

18:06.703 --> 18:10.139
Nice celebratory mood. Perfect for a party.

18:11.475 --> 18:13.670
So, what now, Basquiat?

18:20.349 --> 18:21.839
Rule number one about cutting school.

18:21.951 --> 18:23.418
I've cut school before.

18:23.519 --> 18:24.952
To shop.

18:25.154 --> 18:28.555
- Rule number one, cutting school is fun.
- That's a rule?

18:28.757 --> 18:32.352
Rule number two,
cut rarely to preserve the specialness.

18:32.461 --> 18:34.156
Is that even a word?

18:34.263 --> 18:35.787
Rule number three,

18:35.898 --> 18:39.163
do something culturally rewarding
with your time to earn it morally.

18:39.268 --> 18:40.826
Rule number four, you're a dork.

18:41.036 --> 18:44.334
Wrong. Rule number four, noodles.

18:44.672 --> 18:46.037
Noodles?

19:06.127 --> 19:09.926
Is that how you see us? You're the old man
and I'm your 12-year-old niece?

19:10.030 --> 19:11.588
No.

19:11.732 --> 19:15.259
So, what, you take all the girls
to this movie? Is it your secret weapon?

19:15.435 --> 19:17.528
When you're cutting school,
you go to whatever's playing.

19:18.105 --> 19:19.072
I'm kidding.

19:19.506 --> 19:21.098
- Whoa.
- What?

19:21.408 --> 19:24.377
- That's my stepfather.
- So?

19:24.478 --> 19:27.276
Well, A, his office is
on the other side of town.

19:27.381 --> 19:30.407
And B, he looks weird.

19:32.953 --> 19:34.545
Let's follow him.

19:37.023 --> 19:40.481
- What do you think he's doing?
- Probably just going to a meeting.

19:40.593 --> 19:44.495
I bet it's a lovers' rendezvous.
My stepfather cheated all the time.

19:45.264 --> 19:46.754
Maybe.

19:47.967 --> 19:51.869
No offense, but he looks kind of creepy.

20:02.213 --> 20:03.840
Strange place for a meeting.

20:05.684 --> 20:08.380
Lovers' rendezvous amended to

20:09.020 --> 20:10.988
drug buy from skanky hooker.

20:20.799 --> 20:22.494
Hey, Bill.

20:22.601 --> 20:25.195
You are like a Cold War spy.
You move only in shadow.

20:25.804 --> 20:27.362
Me? I'm always around.

20:28.606 --> 20:29.971
I see you made some new friends.

20:30.608 --> 20:33.338
Not necessarily. Jury's still out.

20:33.444 --> 20:35.378
I'm happy for you, George. I just...

20:36.480 --> 20:37.504
I just want you to be careful.

20:37.915 --> 20:39.644
- What's wrong with them?
- Nothing.

20:39.883 --> 20:43.580
But they have an easier time
of getting by than you do.

20:43.687 --> 20:45.951
You're not exactly hooking up
with a study group.

20:47.191 --> 20:51.287
Hey, I have something for you.
Career Day is coming up in a few weeks,

20:52.463 --> 20:54.828
and we always assign
an exemplary student

20:54.931 --> 20:57.126
to represent Morgan
to the alumni speakers.

20:57.233 --> 20:59.793
You know, to act as a liaison, escort
them to the classroom, whatever...

20:59.936 --> 21:01.403
You have really lost it.

21:01.504 --> 21:04.302
Then there is that matter
that Mrs. Dougherty broached to me.

21:04.407 --> 21:05.704
- The substitute?
- Yeah.

21:05.808 --> 21:09.266
Smoking on campus
is automatic suspension.

21:10.780 --> 21:12.145
This is the last thing I wanna do.

21:12.682 --> 21:15.981
No problem. Suspension it is.
Done. Effective...

21:16.085 --> 21:17.109
Fine. Fine.

21:18.254 --> 21:21.120
- I'll do it.
- Great. Great.

21:21.223 --> 21:23.783
We'll be sending out an e-mail with
your schedule and your responsibilities.

21:47.081 --> 21:49.140
Are you Dustin?

21:49.850 --> 21:51.283
Yeah.

21:51.585 --> 21:55.077
Hi. I'm George. I'm your liaison.

21:55.790 --> 21:56.984
Hey.

21:57.258 --> 21:58.691
My name is Dustin Heath.

21:58.859 --> 22:01.885
I'm a student. I was a student here.

22:02.763 --> 22:05.095
I was in the class
with that terrifying old man over there.

22:05.666 --> 22:07.031
Yeah, I'm an artist.

22:07.401 --> 22:08.925
Honestly, I don't know what I'm doing here.

22:09.036 --> 22:12.527
Was a little hungover when they
called me and asked me to do this

22:12.639 --> 22:14.698
and I said yes
just to get them off the phone.

22:14.808 --> 22:17.106
I got the schedule in the mail
several days later

22:17.210 --> 22:18.768
and I was a little embarrassed.

22:18.878 --> 22:22.473
I'm not really established or anything.

22:23.950 --> 22:27.977
I had my first art show a year ago,
which was good.

22:29.622 --> 22:31.351
Got me this coat.

22:34.627 --> 22:37.494
Well, let me show you
some of my work here.

22:38.198 --> 22:41.189
I don't know,
sometimes people look at your stuff

22:41.300 --> 22:43.461
and, you know,
they think it's really interesting

22:43.569 --> 22:44.934
or they think it's bullshit,

22:45.037 --> 22:48.131
and I don't know the difference.
I honestly don't.

22:50.576 --> 22:54.307
You just, you know, hope not to be
fooling yourself, I guess.

22:54.847 --> 22:57.213
This is the next slide, here.

22:57.382 --> 22:59.316
Anybody have any questions?

23:02.554 --> 23:05.021
I mean, nobody asked me any questions.
Did I just suck?

23:05.556 --> 23:09.083
You were probably the only real,
non-full-of-shit person speaking today.

23:09.193 --> 23:11.127
It felt like Nagasaki in there.

23:11.229 --> 23:12.696
You were great.

23:13.931 --> 23:14.898
Thanks, man.

23:19.904 --> 23:20.996
Do you paint?

23:21.806 --> 23:23.899
Yeah, I'd like to.

23:24.008 --> 23:25.635
I just don't know what to paint.

23:26.444 --> 23:28.105
Yeah, well, it's the hardest part, you know?

23:28.546 --> 23:30.376
Does that make me not a painter?

23:30.847 --> 23:32.474
The fact that you struggle with it
is a really good thing.

23:33.850 --> 23:36.614
But how can you call yourself a painter
if you don't paint?

23:40.290 --> 23:43.088
- You like Morgan?
- Not really.

23:45.061 --> 23:46.858
I have no idea what I'm doing here.

23:49.032 --> 23:50.932
I don't think anybody does, George.

23:51.268 --> 23:52.997
At least you admit it.

23:54.671 --> 23:59.266
If you want, you can come to my studio
in Brooklyn and check some stuff out.

24:03.846 --> 24:06.838
You sticking around for the holidays?

24:07.049 --> 24:09.950
Nah. St. Bart's. Family yacht.

24:10.085 --> 24:11.052
Oh.

24:11.487 --> 24:13.648
Kidding. No plans.

24:14.056 --> 24:15.489
You're a loser.

24:16.759 --> 24:19.227
Well, me, too. We should hang out.

24:20.262 --> 24:21.661
Maybe.

24:25.066 --> 24:26.499
Merry Christmas!

25:15.248 --> 25:17.478
- Hi.
- Hey.

25:17.583 --> 25:19.175
Should we come in?

25:19.719 --> 25:21.118
Please.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.120
Hi.

25:30.062 --> 25:33.498
These are amazing.
How long did they take?

25:33.599 --> 25:35.362
They're all kind of different, you know?

25:35.601 --> 25:38.536
Each one goes through its own little
process of death and rebirth.

25:40.373 --> 25:42.897
That one literally took me two hours.

25:43.575 --> 25:46.703
They're all their own little entities, really.

25:47.245 --> 25:49.679
- You live here, too?
- Mm-hmm.

25:49.915 --> 25:52.349
It's so simple.

25:54.586 --> 25:56.679
It's not about comfort, really, you know?

25:58.890 --> 26:01.120
You... How old are you?

26:02.260 --> 26:03.625
18.

26:04.162 --> 26:05.527
No.

26:08.399 --> 26:10.867
Every time I think about a subject,

26:11.502 --> 26:14.994
or even try to visualize an image of
what I think I should paint,

26:15.105 --> 26:17.630
I just feel like I'm full of shit,

26:18.208 --> 26:19.971
like I'm trying to be something I'm not.

26:20.077 --> 26:21.704
George, this is who you are.

26:21.812 --> 26:24.372
This stuff is wonderful, man.
It really is. It's fantastic.

26:24.481 --> 26:28.110
Really? No, they're just doodles,
you know, immature crap.

26:28.218 --> 26:30.413
No, man.
This is what you should be painting.

26:30.521 --> 26:33.182
At least until you evolve into
something else, you know what I mean?

26:33.289 --> 26:35.757
But you gotta exercise the muscle

26:36.926 --> 26:38.894
even if you're not feeling it,
you know what I mean?

26:38.995 --> 26:41.555
You just... You gotta do it
or else it'll never happen.

26:44.100 --> 26:45.829
Hey, man, by the way,

26:47.337 --> 26:48.804
very nice work.

26:49.138 --> 26:51.038
- Huh?
- Very nice work.

26:52.875 --> 26:53.842
Oh.

26:55.545 --> 26:57.706
Well, you guys are together, right?

26:58.680 --> 27:00.045
No.

27:00.215 --> 27:02.911
I'm sorry. That was stupid.
I shouldn't have said anything.

27:03.852 --> 27:07.219
No, not at all. We're not together.

27:07.422 --> 27:08.855
You like her.

27:10.125 --> 27:12.184
You should like her, if you don't.

27:15.664 --> 27:17.222
I'll leave that alone.

27:24.473 --> 27:26.463
- That was so cool.
- Uh-huh.

27:26.574 --> 27:30.066
I mean, he's amazing. Really talented.
Don't you think?

27:30.177 --> 27:33.340
A little derivative.
I'm not sure he's the real deal.

27:33.447 --> 27:37.781
Really? He seemed like it to me.
I mean, he's a mentor to you now.

27:37.885 --> 27:40.854
- Aren't you psyched?
- I think he's a bit of a blowhard.

27:40.955 --> 27:42.422
You're so weird.

27:42.523 --> 27:44.718
Did he say anything about me?

27:45.693 --> 27:47.092
Nope.

27:57.137 --> 27:59.435
- Did you read the Book Review?
- Mmm-hmm.

27:59.973 --> 28:02.703
New book about the M-1 tank. Can't wait.

28:04.277 --> 28:05.869
What about you?

28:05.979 --> 28:07.173
I'm interested in...

28:50.121 --> 28:52.214
- Great job.
- Thank you.

28:52.757 --> 28:55.191
Thanks. I appreciate it.

28:56.327 --> 28:58.761
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

29:06.037 --> 29:07.436
What happened?

29:17.247 --> 29:18.441
I don't wanna lose this!

29:18.582 --> 29:20.413
Viv, we're not gonna lose this place.
I promise you.

29:20.550 --> 29:23.041
- I don't believe you anymore.
- He's gonna come through.

29:23.153 --> 29:25.053
- No!
- Yes, he's gonna come through,

29:25.188 --> 29:26.246
and I have two other guys...

29:26.356 --> 29:28.449
It's always some other person,
it's always some other thing.

29:28.558 --> 29:29.616
I'm tired of this!

30:20.642 --> 30:21.700
Hey!

30:26.681 --> 30:28.910
- What?
- Nothing.

30:30.317 --> 30:31.682
You okay?

30:32.519 --> 30:34.077
I'm allergic to hormones.

30:34.288 --> 30:35.949
What hormones?

30:36.056 --> 30:37.421
Mine.

30:42.129 --> 30:45.656
- Hi, George!
- Hey, Zoe. Great place.

30:46.900 --> 30:49.095
Your folks getting dinner
at the soup kitchen?

30:49.670 --> 30:52.195
No, they don't live here.
They live in Greenwich.

30:52.372 --> 30:54.862
- You live here alone?
- Yes, George.

30:54.974 --> 30:57.636
I wanted to go to school in the city,
so my parents rented me this place.

30:58.978 --> 31:00.445
Hey, Nick.

31:03.082 --> 31:04.447
Looking pretty hot, Sal.

31:05.585 --> 31:06.609
Thanks.

31:06.786 --> 31:09.619
I think we need some one-on-one time,
you and me.

31:09.789 --> 31:12.223
Oh, you do, do you?

31:14.293 --> 31:16.887
Zinavoy, what's with the overcoat?

31:17.263 --> 31:18.628
We're indoors now.

31:20.265 --> 31:21.630
I like layers.

31:27.739 --> 31:29.730
- Did you see it, man?
- See what?

31:29.941 --> 31:31.431
The invite. Check it out.

31:37.315 --> 31:38.714
Bang!

31:40.785 --> 31:42.150
It's pretty solid, huh?

31:44.623 --> 31:45.748
All right, y'all. Let's go to the club.

31:55.633 --> 31:57.260
I'm not dressed for this.

31:57.368 --> 31:59.802
You're fine. And we're with Will.

31:59.903 --> 32:02.667
It's not a big deal, but I've never
been to one of these before.

32:03.707 --> 32:05.971
Don't worry. I won't lose you.

32:08.312 --> 32:09.609
- Hey!
- Hey, guys.

32:09.713 --> 32:12.510
This is yours, for the drawing. Dominate it.

32:12.615 --> 32:14.014
Thanks.

32:14.183 --> 32:15.480
Come on!

32:24.327 --> 32:25.692
Come on.

32:39.641 --> 32:42.007
- Nick is here!
- Hey!

32:47.049 --> 32:48.016
Sorry.

33:11.639 --> 33:13.038
Hi.

33:19.313 --> 33:21.076
Do you want me to introduce you
to any girls?

33:21.682 --> 33:23.206
What?

33:23.317 --> 33:26.013
I have a lot of slutty friends here
you might like.

33:26.120 --> 33:27.849
Oh, no. No, I'm cool.

33:29.889 --> 33:32.016
I mean, I'm cool just hanging out.

33:32.225 --> 33:36.025
That's all right, George.
We all know who you're waiting for.

33:36.196 --> 33:38.289
What? No. I'm not.

33:41.534 --> 33:43.968
- Zoe, that's not what I...
- Bye-bye!

33:46.806 --> 33:48.205
Yeah, yeah!

34:34.485 --> 34:39.217
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,

34:39.322 --> 34:42.018
four, three, two, one!

34:42.126 --> 34:44.094
Happy New Year!

35:05.882 --> 35:07.281
Hey.

35:17.560 --> 35:19.391
Why didn't you go with Nick?

35:19.595 --> 35:22.257
Why would I? I spent two hours in there
looking for you.

35:23.532 --> 35:26.831
- Didn't you used to date him?
- Yeah, for like five minutes.

35:27.937 --> 35:29.302
Why do you like that guy?

35:29.405 --> 35:31.737
I don't! I would tell you if I did.

35:34.743 --> 35:36.074
I'm so sorry.

35:36.979 --> 35:39.311
Sally, I'm so sorry. I ruined your night.

35:40.014 --> 35:43.472
No, I'm sorry. I lost you.

35:44.252 --> 35:45.776
Broke my promise.

35:48.923 --> 35:50.288
I think you're

35:52.660 --> 35:54.287
amazing.

35:56.397 --> 35:58.388
What a stupid thing to say.

35:59.234 --> 36:01.099
No. No, it was...

36:02.237 --> 36:03.637
It was sweet.

36:05.939 --> 36:06.928
Come on.

36:11.211 --> 36:12.576
Careful.

38:07.991 --> 38:10.653
This is the cure to end all cures.

38:10.760 --> 38:13.661
My daddy used to put a raw egg in his
to really get the effects.

38:13.763 --> 38:15.628
- You want an egg?
- No.

38:16.598 --> 38:18.498
You've heard of a hair of the dog?

38:23.105 --> 38:25.369
Beef bouillon floater there.

38:27.142 --> 38:28.541
How are you feeling?

38:28.777 --> 38:31.268
Much better.
Thank you for taking care of me.

38:31.380 --> 38:32.745
Mom, what are you doing?

38:32.881 --> 38:35.111
But you have to have
a coalminer's tonic, Miss Grumpy.

38:35.217 --> 38:36.946
It's like a vaccine.

38:37.886 --> 38:39.945
I can't deal. I'm going back to bed.

38:43.891 --> 38:46.826
Angrier than a pit bull when she wakes up.

39:46.085 --> 39:47.712
I like that boy.

39:47.820 --> 39:49.151
So do I.

39:50.289 --> 39:53.087
Sal, I don't think you should be
messing around with him.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.785
Are you giving me dating advice?

39:58.297 --> 40:01.459
I just think you should be going out
with someone your own speed.

40:01.699 --> 40:03.223
Don't worry, we're just friends.

40:03.468 --> 40:04.833
That's exactly what worries me.

40:05.470 --> 40:07.938
Charlotte, I don't comment
on your social life.

40:08.106 --> 40:10.404
You hardly have the right
to comment on mine.

40:10.508 --> 40:13.136
- I've seen the way he looks at you.
- Jesus.

40:13.344 --> 40:15.005
This all means something
much more to him.

40:15.913 --> 40:19.781
Trust me, I've played with
their affections my whole life.

40:21.719 --> 40:24.381
But with the good ones, it's not right.

40:26.223 --> 40:29.158
That's what you do. It's not what I'm doing.

40:39.703 --> 40:41.068
This is a great idea, by the way.

40:41.938 --> 40:43.371
I got a show coming up
in a couple of months.

40:43.473 --> 40:45.498
I needed some inspiration, you know?

40:46.143 --> 40:47.667
Big time.

40:48.111 --> 40:49.840
Do you like this?

40:49.946 --> 40:52.311
I get it. Do you?

40:52.515 --> 40:56.110
I think anyone could turn this out,
except why would they want to?

40:56.252 --> 40:57.617
What's it saying?

40:57.720 --> 40:59.244
Makes a room look great, though,
you know?

41:00.055 --> 41:01.488
It looks like money.

41:08.731 --> 41:10.062
Oh, God.

41:11.033 --> 41:12.694
This is heaven to me.

41:14.136 --> 41:15.603
Pretty great.

41:16.038 --> 41:19.097
This makes you feel something
instantly, you know what I mean?

41:20.775 --> 41:22.470
Like anger

41:23.111 --> 41:24.476
or wrath.

41:25.079 --> 41:26.478
Lust.

41:33.755 --> 41:37.054
So, how's it going with
our friend Sally? Make any moves?

41:39.127 --> 41:40.560
She hasn't shown any interest.

41:40.762 --> 41:42.024
Well, have you?

41:43.064 --> 41:46.430
What do you think, she's gonna go
around wearing a sign around her neck?

41:46.533 --> 41:47.864
Women love being desired.

41:47.968 --> 41:51.631
You just go throw her up against
the wall, start kissing her.

41:51.738 --> 41:53.831
Chances are she'll kiss you back.

41:53.941 --> 41:56.501
And if she doesn't, then at least you tried.

41:59.279 --> 42:02.874
You gotta do something
or you might lose her.

42:18.698 --> 42:19.858
You love this.

42:22.101 --> 42:23.500
No, it's good.

42:25.638 --> 42:29.335
Fetishizing an object. That suits you.

42:43.822 --> 42:47.417
I can't believe we're participating
in this consumer circle jerk.

42:47.525 --> 42:49.652
The dateless need to
stick together tonight.

42:49.761 --> 42:52.025
We're like survivors huddling for warmth.

42:52.664 --> 42:55.030
You've probably had so many Valentines.

42:55.800 --> 42:58.598
Is that some kind of euphemism for slut?

43:02.406 --> 43:04.306
The one I remember most was my dad.

43:05.142 --> 43:06.166
Where was that?

43:06.777 --> 43:08.972
It was before we left Tennessee.

43:09.079 --> 43:13.539
I was six and he had already left,
but he'd come back every so often.

43:13.851 --> 43:17.150
He roared up on his motorcycle,
took me out alone.

43:17.288 --> 43:20.746
We had pancakes with chocolate syrup
at a diner, at night.

43:22.426 --> 43:23.825
He let me order.

43:26.864 --> 43:28.229
Where's your father?

43:29.198 --> 43:33.931
Beijing. He moved there years ago
for the economic boom.

43:34.504 --> 43:35.903
You guys have a relationship?

43:36.506 --> 43:39.407
He checks in, pays my tuition.

43:39.642 --> 43:44.136
But we couldn't be more different.
I think he's a little disappointed.

43:48.017 --> 43:51.418
I spent some time in Tokyo with him
when I was seven.

43:51.654 --> 43:55.020
He was running a company there,
working 12, 14 hours a day.

43:55.657 --> 43:58.888
So, I had this full-time Japanese
babysitter who didn't speak English.

43:58.994 --> 44:00.222
We couldn't understand each other at all.

44:01.530 --> 44:03.122
Pretty soon,
she ran out of things to do with me

44:03.231 --> 44:06.200
and I ended up
never leaving the hotel room.

44:07.336 --> 44:08.462
I was like a veal.

44:13.241 --> 44:14.799
What were you like as a child?

44:15.777 --> 44:17.506
I was such a better person than I am now.

44:18.413 --> 44:20.505
- Come on.
- I'm serious.

44:20.648 --> 44:25.085
I was happy, I was open, I was curious.

44:26.520 --> 44:29.216
But I'll tell you this,
I knew when it was ending.

44:29.323 --> 44:32.656
I was overwhelmed with sadness
when I realized that I was gonna change

44:32.760 --> 44:35.923
and that it was all
most likely gonna get worse.

44:38.766 --> 44:41.633
Like a nostalgia for the present,
I couldn't shake it.

44:44.972 --> 44:46.405
What?

44:47.273 --> 44:48.706
I'm weird, right?

44:50.243 --> 44:51.676
No.

44:52.445 --> 44:53.844
No, you're not.

45:02.655 --> 45:05.715
It's weird not having a boyfriend.

45:05.859 --> 45:07.417
It's been so long.

45:07.894 --> 45:11.352
That's because it's the first year at school
nobody's older than you.

45:11.498 --> 45:12.964
Your pool dried up.

45:14.166 --> 45:17.192
- How do you know that?
- I'm a very insightful person.

45:21.807 --> 45:23.934
Have you ever had sex?

45:26.045 --> 45:27.205
Yeah, tons.

45:27.813 --> 45:29.144
No, really. Have you?

45:31.583 --> 45:33.141
Why are you asking me this?

45:36.088 --> 45:37.316
You know I haven't.

45:37.423 --> 45:41.051
Well, I don't know, I'm just wondering.

45:45.163 --> 45:47.028
Have you ever thought about me?

45:48.166 --> 45:49.224
What do you mean?

45:50.034 --> 45:54.562
You know what I mean.
Have you ever thought about it?

45:56.841 --> 45:58.069
Why are you doing this?

46:03.114 --> 46:05.343
Will you have sex with me?

46:13.757 --> 46:15.315
I'm just kidding.

46:15.425 --> 46:16.824
Bad idea.

46:18.428 --> 46:21.727
I mean, can you imagine
how weird that would be?

46:27.871 --> 46:29.668
You're my only real friend.

46:30.407 --> 46:31.839
Let's not ruin it.

46:43.552 --> 46:45.577
Should we check in with Will and Zoe?

46:49.959 --> 46:51.392
George?

46:54.697 --> 46:56.062
George?

46:57.298 --> 46:58.788
I have to go.

46:59.100 --> 47:00.761
What?

47:00.869 --> 47:02.666
I'm not feeling well.

47:03.371 --> 47:05.271
Okay. Well, will I see you tomorrow?

47:05.907 --> 47:07.340
I don't know.

47:10.478 --> 47:13.242
This is wrong. It's a joke.

47:16.618 --> 47:18.711
You think too much, George!

48:09.135 --> 48:10.363
Get out.

48:10.636 --> 48:13.537
George? What is going on?
Why aren't you at school?

48:14.006 --> 48:17.031
If you speak even the most rudimentary
form of the English language,

48:17.175 --> 48:18.164
then you'll understand this,

48:19.844 --> 48:20.902
leave me alone.

48:21.746 --> 48:23.145
What did you just say to me?

48:23.882 --> 48:26.043
Vivian, my voice is calm.

48:26.151 --> 48:27.550
I'm a free-thinking individual

48:27.652 --> 48:29.950
who chooses not to be engaged
in this discussion.

48:32.857 --> 48:34.256
Please.

49:10.026 --> 49:11.391
George, what are you doing?

49:12.629 --> 49:14.961
I'm sorry, Jack.
I need to be left alone right now.

49:15.064 --> 49:16.497
What about your work?

49:16.733 --> 49:18.257
I just can't do it right now.

49:19.802 --> 49:21.429
I'm going through something.

49:22.605 --> 49:24.004
That's pathetic.

49:25.842 --> 49:27.309
At least it's the truth.

49:27.744 --> 49:29.507
What's that supposed to mean?

50:40.113 --> 50:41.842
- Hey.
- Hey.

50:41.948 --> 50:44.246
- How are you?
- Good.

50:45.085 --> 50:46.518
That's good.

50:47.487 --> 50:50.149
Everything... Everything all right?

50:50.290 --> 50:52.280
Yeah. Yeah, everything's all right.

50:55.594 --> 50:57.994
How's George? He hasn't returned my calls.

50:58.731 --> 51:01.928
Yeah, that's kind of
what I wanted to talk to you about.

51:02.034 --> 51:04.628
He's not exactly speaking to me either.

51:04.737 --> 51:07.205
- Why? What happened?
- I don't know.

51:08.307 --> 51:10.298
You know George.

51:10.709 --> 51:12.870
He's complicated, I guess.

51:16.949 --> 51:18.347
Yeah.

51:19.951 --> 51:20.940
I was wondering,

51:21.052 --> 51:24.544
I'm not just George's friend to you, am I?

51:34.966 --> 51:36.763
You and George should be together, Sally.

51:37.268 --> 51:38.792
We're just friends.

51:40.405 --> 51:41.838
There's no such thing.

51:44.374 --> 51:45.807
I love this song.

51:53.283 --> 51:54.841
You wanna dance?

51:56.420 --> 51:57.910
Come on.

52:07.464 --> 52:09.125
What?

52:09.432 --> 52:10.990
We shouldn't be doing this.

52:11.300 --> 52:14.269
- We're just dancing.
- Oh, yeah?

52:35.890 --> 52:37.255
George.

52:38.993 --> 52:42.554
Been looking forward to reading
your Hardy paper. Today's the day.

52:44.232 --> 52:46.223
Sorry, I don't have it.

52:46.534 --> 52:48.695
George, this was
your final project of the year.

52:48.837 --> 52:52.603
After this, there's just exams.
How am I supposed to grade you?

52:54.242 --> 52:57.370
I'll have it to you by next week, I promise.

52:59.714 --> 53:01.442
That's not gonna be good enough.

53:08.322 --> 53:09.311
Hey, pal.

53:16.296 --> 53:20.357
I called this meeting because
your teachers have reported to me

53:20.467 --> 53:22.264
that you continue to refuse
to do the course work.

53:22.369 --> 53:26.032
You have made zero effort to turn
your career here at Morgan around.

53:26.306 --> 53:27.772
Yes, I did.

53:27.907 --> 53:32.105
I mean, I did struggle with it
at the beginning, but I just couldn't.

53:32.199 --> 53:34.633
Well, you are out of time.

53:35.302 --> 53:37.736
The moment to decide your future
has arrived.

53:39.306 --> 53:43.936
Now, against the recommendation
of some in this room,

53:44.144 --> 53:45.907
I'm giving you a choice.

53:46.780 --> 53:48.407
First is expulsion.

53:48.915 --> 53:50.678
It's yours if you want it.

53:50.917 --> 53:52.282
Second option,

53:52.719 --> 53:57.485
if you want to graduate, you make up
every single assignment you missed.

53:57.623 --> 53:59.284
Every paper, every exercise.

53:59.391 --> 54:02.622
Essentially, a year's worth of homework.

54:04.230 --> 54:07.631
If even one is missing
on graduation day, no diploma.

54:10.169 --> 54:12.137
You have a little over three weeks.

54:13.572 --> 54:17.508
George, I used to believe you had
more potential than anyone else here.

54:17.610 --> 54:19.543
But you never delivered, not once.

54:20.345 --> 54:21.835
I wasn't gonna waste the time
getting mad at you.

54:22.013 --> 54:24.038
I'm not gonna waste the time
defending you now.

54:30.488 --> 54:33.252
Forget the lack of respect
you show, George.

54:34.659 --> 54:39.119
This is the way we make our living,
how we spend our lives.

54:39.464 --> 54:42.331
But you simply don't care
what goes on around here.

54:42.567 --> 54:45.127
Why would we continue to reward that?

54:47.371 --> 54:48.770
You're right.

54:49.906 --> 54:51.271
You shouldn't reward it.

54:54.478 --> 54:56.776
I honestly don't know what to say.

54:58.315 --> 55:00.146
Maybe it should be expulsion.

55:03.687 --> 55:05.052
Let us know on Monday.

55:05.489 --> 55:07.286
All right. All right.

55:09.192 --> 55:10.181
Thank you.

55:17.500 --> 55:20.697
Did you tell my parents about this?

55:21.070 --> 55:23.231
Yes, George, I had to.

55:35.318 --> 55:36.785
Hey.

55:37.919 --> 55:39.318
I don't know what to say.

55:40.155 --> 55:43.215
Is it my fault?
I mean, I've had a lot on my mind and...

55:43.325 --> 55:44.690
It's not your fault.

55:46.828 --> 55:48.796
I don't think I can do it.

55:48.897 --> 55:51.832
Well, what do you mean?
What other choice is there?

55:51.933 --> 55:54.868
- Mom, I'm not sure that I can.
- You're just gonna have to do it.

55:54.969 --> 55:57.460
You're just gonna have to sit down
and just do it!

55:57.572 --> 55:59.039
Mom, I'm trying to speak to you honestly.

55:59.174 --> 56:02.041
I don't care! I'm done listening to your lies!

56:02.177 --> 56:03.508
Come on, that's really the way to fix this!

56:03.610 --> 56:07.011
Hey, George!
This is your mess, and it's a disaster.

56:07.381 --> 56:08.814
You're right, Jack. It is my mess.

56:09.450 --> 56:11.077
I'll handle my mess, you handle yours.

56:11.685 --> 56:13.312
- Okay, watch that tone.
- Wait, Viv.

56:14.855 --> 56:16.083
What does that mean?

56:16.724 --> 56:18.692
I mean, you wanna tell us
where you've been spending your days

56:18.792 --> 56:20.225
for a couple of months this past winter?

56:21.261 --> 56:23.229
What's going on with your disaster?

56:23.464 --> 56:25.227
Phone gets shut off.
We can't pay the electricity.

56:25.332 --> 56:27.357
Furniture is disappearing around here
piece by piece.

56:27.668 --> 56:30.033
George, stop it. You don't understand.

56:30.203 --> 56:31.192
Do you?

56:32.071 --> 56:34.198
Do you know that Jack was wandering
the streets for weeks,

56:34.307 --> 56:35.774
pretending to go to work?

56:35.975 --> 56:37.567
Did you get that sorted out, Jack?

56:37.677 --> 56:40.874
Or are you still working out of a coffee
shop booth like a homeless person?

56:41.114 --> 56:42.103
Jack, stop!

56:43.883 --> 56:45.043
Stop it!

56:46.319 --> 56:48.651
Jack! Stop!

56:48.955 --> 56:50.582
Get off!

56:57.095 --> 56:58.153
George!

57:11.376 --> 57:12.775
Sally!

57:14.179 --> 57:15.612
Sally?

57:18.583 --> 57:20.016
George!

57:21.919 --> 57:23.716
What's going on? What happened?

57:38.736 --> 57:40.169
What's wrong?

57:43.541 --> 57:44.633
What is it?

58:03.760 --> 58:05.159
George.

58:05.695 --> 58:07.185
George, hey.

58:10.200 --> 58:12.031
I just wanted to make sure you're all right.

58:15.804 --> 58:17.772
I had a really hard time, George.

58:18.640 --> 58:21.438
I swear. I promise, I...

58:22.377 --> 58:24.140
I thought you were gonna leave it alone.

58:26.882 --> 58:28.281
I'm not gonna say sorry.

58:31.420 --> 58:33.251
Isn't it better that it's me?

58:33.989 --> 58:37.015
As opposed to some douche bag
she just met

58:38.093 --> 58:40.356
and wouldn't even let you look at her?

58:41.329 --> 58:42.853
You want me to thank you?

58:44.232 --> 58:45.790
I actually felt something.

58:47.435 --> 58:51.030
That doesn't always happen.
It hasn't happened in a very long time.

58:51.239 --> 58:56.176
And I've lived long enough to know
that when it does, you should act on it.

58:59.614 --> 59:01.241
I didn't think you were ready.

59:08.088 --> 59:09.783
I thought you were so cool.

59:12.692 --> 59:14.683
I never meet anyone cool.

59:56.502 --> 59:57.867
Hi.

59:58.369 --> 59:59.529
Hi.

01:00:00.305 --> 01:00:01.704
I didn't want to be up there.

01:00:03.207 --> 01:00:04.902
Can't have been fun for you.

01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:10.641
He broke his collarbone.
We were in the ER all night.

01:00:11.916 --> 01:00:15.113
I'm so sorry.
That should have never happened.

01:00:15.286 --> 01:00:16.947
Mom, I started it.

01:00:18.222 --> 01:00:20.656
He's a 50-year-old man.

01:00:21.426 --> 01:00:22.791
He's supposed to protect you.

01:00:22.894 --> 01:00:24.918
Mom, I'm obnoxious,
I'm deeply disrespectful.

01:00:25.028 --> 01:00:26.791
We're getting a divorce.

01:00:37.207 --> 01:00:39.971
Come on, I'm sure he'll never do it again.

01:00:42.346 --> 01:00:44.746
Now that he knows I can hospitalize him.

01:00:47.184 --> 01:00:49.311
We were already headed there.

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.649
His business went bankrupt
about a year ago,

01:00:52.755 --> 01:00:56.521
and I thought I should have faith in him
and support him.

01:00:56.726 --> 01:01:00.594
But there was always some sort of excuse,

01:01:01.263 --> 01:01:03.697
or his luck was about to turn.

01:01:03.799 --> 01:01:06.927
So, he convinced me
to mortgage the apartment,

01:01:07.036 --> 01:01:08.833
and then my own business.

01:01:09.639 --> 01:01:11.231
But it was never enough.

01:01:12.274 --> 01:01:16.005
He's a sick man, and I should have told you,

01:01:16.544 --> 01:01:19.843
but you were under enough pressure
and I didn't wanna distract you.

01:01:20.081 --> 01:01:21.605
I like distractions.

01:01:23.218 --> 01:01:24.776
It gets worse.

01:01:30.158 --> 01:01:31.625
I have to sell the apartment.

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:33.459
What?

01:01:34.262 --> 01:01:37.720
The debt has erased my credit.

01:01:55.082 --> 01:01:56.549
What am I gonna do?

01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:04.885
I'll do it.

01:02:05.492 --> 01:02:06.857
Hold on.

01:02:07.461 --> 01:02:08.825
You have three weeks.

01:02:09.028 --> 01:02:11.462
And you still have to come to school
and take finals.

01:02:11.698 --> 01:02:13.165
You know that already?

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:18.297
Pick up your assignment packets from
your teachers. You miss one, no diploma.

01:02:18.504 --> 01:02:20.699
- Okay.
- Go.

01:02:24.277 --> 01:02:26.507
I've given this a lot of thought, George.

01:02:26.746 --> 01:02:28.805
I don't think I'm being easy on you.

01:02:29.015 --> 01:02:31.882
I simply don't believe
that dull, lifeless assignments

01:02:32.018 --> 01:02:34.542
are the measures of a person's soul.

01:02:37.355 --> 01:02:38.788
I want one,

01:02:38.957 --> 01:02:41.425
one meaningful work from you.

01:02:41.626 --> 01:02:44.493
I want you to look in the mirror,
listen to your gut,

01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:48.894
and make an image
that speaks to the real you.

01:02:49.234 --> 01:02:52.761
What you care about. What you believe.

01:02:54.139 --> 01:02:56.664
It can be big, it can be small.

01:02:57.743 --> 01:03:00.109
It can be painted in bat shit.

01:03:01.645 --> 01:03:03.738
As long as it's honest and fearless.

01:03:05.182 --> 01:03:07.116
Harris, you have no idea
how much this helps...

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:09.752
But! But. The caveat.

01:03:09.954 --> 01:03:11.649
If I smell a rat,

01:03:11.889 --> 01:03:15.882
if you didn't find something you've
never had the courage to say before,

01:03:16.093 --> 01:03:19.221
I don't pass you. You don't get out of here.

01:03:20.164 --> 01:03:22.155
All your work down the drain.

01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:25.928
Now, go, get out of here.

01:03:30.073 --> 01:03:31.472
How are you?

01:03:33.009 --> 01:03:34.840
How are things with Jack?

01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:37.645
Look, what is so wrong
with me seeing Dustin?

01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:39.146
He told me he was gonna leave it alone.

01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:42.250
- But you told him we weren't together!
- What should I have said?

01:03:42.352 --> 01:03:43.842
What did you wanna say?

01:03:43.953 --> 01:03:48.390
There you go again with the mind games.
Treacherous, sadistic little hussy.

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:51.949
George! There was nothing between us.

01:03:54.997 --> 01:03:58.558
- I'm sorry.
- No. You're right.

01:04:02.571 --> 01:04:06.302
I gotta go. I have to make up a year's
worth of homework or I don't graduate.

01:04:06.508 --> 01:04:08.806
- What?
- Have fun with Dustin.

01:04:10.579 --> 01:04:13.013
I'm so pleased to have made
the introduction.

01:04:13.615 --> 01:04:16.083
And it's good.

01:04:16.185 --> 01:04:17.948
We've had some great memories here,
you know?

01:04:20.555 --> 01:04:22.955
We should definitely look into
signing a lease for this place.

01:04:23.157 --> 01:04:24.556
- It's absolutely perfect.
- Sure, sure.

01:05:08.768 --> 01:05:10.758
It's a great room. Hi, honey.

01:07:13.922 --> 01:07:15.480
I think I'm done.

01:07:16.191 --> 01:07:17.590
Me, too.

01:07:19.527 --> 01:07:22.689
We had a lot of fun in the beginning,
you, me, and your father.

01:07:23.597 --> 01:07:25.155
I don't get what happened.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.365
After Dad.

01:07:27.701 --> 01:07:29.464
Things change.

01:07:30.371 --> 01:07:33.272
Sometimes so quickly
you don't even notice it.

01:07:34.141 --> 01:07:37.372
I don't know. Happiness is, like,
something you have to look after,

01:07:37.511 --> 01:07:38.876
be vigilant about.

01:07:40.781 --> 01:07:43.272
I mean, you know that Jack loved us.

01:07:44.118 --> 01:07:45.881
That wasn't an illusion.

01:07:46.587 --> 01:07:48.486
He loved you like a son.

01:07:50.056 --> 01:07:51.580
Do you know where he is now?

01:07:54.227 --> 01:07:55.592
No.

01:07:58.865 --> 01:08:01.527
Do you have any idea
of what you wanna do?

01:08:03.569 --> 01:08:05.434
I wanna try and get into an art school.

01:08:07.673 --> 01:08:09.004
I need real training.

01:08:41.372 --> 01:08:42.895
Thank you for coming.

01:08:45.109 --> 01:08:48.805
So much has happened,
and so much is happening, and...

01:08:50.113 --> 01:08:52.912
I just need you to be my friend, okay?

01:08:54.051 --> 01:08:56.814
I really, really need that. Please.

01:09:04.261 --> 01:09:06.990
My mom is marrying this guy
she's known for three months

01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:08.756
and moving to Texas to be with him.

01:09:09.232 --> 01:09:11.166
She's already down there.

01:09:11.334 --> 01:09:14.131
Getting engaged means
her alimony payment stops,

01:09:14.237 --> 01:09:18.332
which means she can't pay
my tuition for Boulder next year,

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:20.336
which means I don't get out.

01:09:21.578 --> 01:09:23.738
She wants me to go live with her in Texas.

01:09:25.215 --> 01:09:26.580
What are you gonna do?

01:09:27.283 --> 01:09:29.513
That's the hard part.

01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:33.850
Because I'm leaving tomorrow.

01:09:34.890 --> 01:09:36.380
Where are you going?

01:09:37.658 --> 01:09:40.992
Dustin and I are gonna backpack
around Europe for the summer.

01:09:41.196 --> 01:09:43.630
His show sold out. It's his present to me.

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.827
What about graduation?

01:09:48.069 --> 01:09:51.938
After everything, I'm over it.
They can mail it to me.

01:09:52.107 --> 01:09:53.734
And Zoe, Will, and...

01:09:53.908 --> 01:09:55.376
I love those guys,

01:09:57.011 --> 01:09:58.478
but that was never really me.

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:01.145
And after Europe?

01:10:01.716 --> 01:10:04.844
Who knows? Not Texas.

01:10:07.989 --> 01:10:09.354
I need to tell you something.

01:10:13.261 --> 01:10:15.252
You were right, in a way.

01:10:15.396 --> 01:10:17.956
I should've been able to say
what I wanted to.

01:10:22.303 --> 01:10:25.237
I'm in love with you. I always have been.

01:10:31.545 --> 01:10:35.447
I thought you were the unfair one,
but it was unfair of me not to say it.

01:10:36.349 --> 01:10:37.816
So, I've said it.

01:10:42.122 --> 01:10:43.487
I was nothing.

01:10:44.324 --> 01:10:46.053
I felt like nothing.

01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:48.459
Less than.

01:10:50.262 --> 01:10:51.661
You changed that.

01:12:07.436 --> 01:12:09.734
You know we're gonna be together
one day.

01:12:10.439 --> 01:12:13.408
We have to sort through
all of our messed-up issues

01:12:13.643 --> 01:12:16.771
and you have to sleep with a lot
of girls to get it out of your system.

01:12:18.114 --> 01:12:19.809
Don't go.

01:12:19.949 --> 01:12:21.507
Please.

01:12:21.617 --> 01:12:23.107
It's a long life.

01:12:23.819 --> 01:12:25.377
We're not done.

01:12:30.626 --> 01:12:34.117
Treacherous, sadistic little hussy.

01:12:39.034 --> 01:12:40.433
I love you, too.

01:13:43.196 --> 01:13:44.561
Here it is.

01:13:46.065 --> 01:13:47.464
We'll see.

01:13:48.534 --> 01:13:50.661
We are getting down to the wire.

01:13:51.737 --> 01:13:54.968
I'll either be calling your name or I won't.

01:14:32.743 --> 01:14:34.233
Son of a bitch.

01:14:43.653 --> 01:14:45.018
Mara Ryder.

01:14:46.589 --> 01:14:48.682
Did she say when she'd be back?

01:14:51.361 --> 01:14:53.886
I can't believe she didn't even call me.

01:14:54.864 --> 01:14:56.491
What did I do?

01:14:56.699 --> 01:14:58.496
Will Sharpe.

01:15:26.995 --> 01:15:28.690
They're about to close the doors.

01:15:28.931 --> 01:15:33.391
Final boarding call for Dallas
Flight 2013, passenger Diana Mayer.

01:15:34.770 --> 01:15:36.168
Come here.

01:15:57.792 --> 01:15:59.919
Veronica Walsh.

01:16:00.962 --> 01:16:02.485
You're gonna be okay.

01:16:02.729 --> 01:16:04.128
I'm fine.

01:16:04.231 --> 01:16:06.961
We'll have plenty of girls
lined up for you, I promise.

01:16:07.067 --> 01:16:08.625
Zoe, really, I'm...

01:16:09.469 --> 01:16:11.334
Thank you.

01:16:12.038 --> 01:16:13.437
And

01:16:14.207 --> 01:16:16.300
George Zinavoy.

01:16:47.239 --> 01:16:49.969
Anything is possible.

01:17:29.346 --> 01:17:30.938
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

01:17:31.815 --> 01:17:32.839
I'm starving.

01:18:35.577 --> 01:18:36.976
Not bad.

01:18:46.487 --> 01:18:48.580
I mean, it's all right.

01:18:49.623 --> 01:18:51.250
It's good.

01:19:05.204 --> 01:19:06.967
So, what are you gonna do?

01:19:08.141 --> 01:19:09.608
Are you staying?

01:19:14.714 --> 01:19:16.306
I don't know.
