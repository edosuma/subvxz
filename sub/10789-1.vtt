WEBVTT

00:01.250 --> 00:03.166
FULLY REFUNDABLE, RIGHT?
YOU BET.

00:03.166 --> 00:04.333
IT'S A SHAME
YOU CAN'T USE THIS.

00:04.333 --> 00:06.458
PARIS IS SUPPOSED
TO BE AMAZING
IN THE SPRING.

00:06.458 --> 00:08.333
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I HEAR.

00:16.542 --> 00:17.750
SO I DIDN'T GO TO PARIS.

00:17.750 --> 00:20.625
BUT I TOTALLY COULD'VE.
I MEAN, WHAT DAWSON
SAID THAT NIGHT

00:20.625 --> 00:23.125
DEFINITELY RANG TRUE.

00:23.125 --> 00:25.542
COME ON, RAIN MAN.

00:25.542 --> 00:26.583
YOUR LIFE AWAITS.

00:26.583 --> 00:27.667
YOURS, TOO, YOU KNOW.

00:27.667 --> 00:30.667
HE WAS RIGHT. MY LIFE
WAS  WAITING FOR ME OUT THERE.

00:30.667 --> 00:33.166
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I HAD TO MAX OUT
MY ONE AND ONLY CREDIT CARD

00:33.166 --> 00:35.750
AND FLY HALFWAY ACROSS
THE WORLD TO FIND IT.
SCREW THAT.

00:35.750 --> 00:39.333
INSTEAD, I EMBRACED
THE SIMPLE, RELATIVELY
ANGST-FREE PLEASURES

00:39.333 --> 00:41.291
OF A SUMMER IN CAPESIDE.
I READ A LOT OF BOOKS,

00:41.291 --> 00:42.542
LISTENED TO A LOT OF CDs,

00:42.542 --> 00:44.041
WAITED A LOT OF TABLES
AT THE YACHT CLUB.

00:44.041 --> 00:45.834
OH...AND I MET A BOY.

00:45.834 --> 00:48.458
HE WAS VERY CUTE
AND VERY NICE,

00:48.458 --> 00:50.667
AND THINGS WERE GOING VERY WELL
RIGHT UP UNTIL THE MOMENT
HE SAID...

00:50.667 --> 00:53.708
I THINK I'M IN LOVE
WITH YOU.

00:53.708 --> 00:55.208
I KNOW. POOR JOEY POTTER.

00:55.208 --> 00:56.417
CUTE BOY FALLS
IN LOVE WITH HER.
HOW TRAGIC.

00:56.417 --> 00:59.375
BUT IT WAS A COMPLETELY
INAPPROPRIATE DISPLAY
OF AFFECTION.

00:59.375 --> 01:03.083
NOW, PACEY AND AUDREY,
ON THE OTHER HAND,
THEY WERE SMART.

01:03.083 --> 01:05.542
THEY WERE KEEPING IT SIMPLE.
THEY WERE ALL ABOUT THE FUN.

01:05.542 --> 01:08.917
THEY CAME, THEY SAW,
THEY PRETTY MUCH
KICKED L.A.'s ASS.

01:08.917 --> 01:11.041
(RADIO PLAYS)

01:11.041 --> 01:14.750
BACK IN BEANTOWN, ERIC
THE CLOSETED FRAT BOY

01:14.750 --> 01:15.959
CAME BARRELING
OUT OF THE CLOSET,

01:15.959 --> 01:17.375
AND THE TWO OF THEM
HAD A GRAND OLD SUMMER

01:17.375 --> 01:20.542
DOING ALL THE THINGS
THAT YOUNG PEOPLE IN LOVE
ARE WONT TO DO.

01:20.542 --> 01:23.542
BUT THEN JACK SUCCUMBED
TO A FATE TYPICALLY RESERVED
FOR HETEROSEXUAL WOMEN--

01:23.542 --> 01:27.417
HE WAS DUMPED FOR SOMEONE
FAR YOUNGER AND PRETTIER
THAN HIMSELF...

01:27.417 --> 01:28.750
BY E-MAIL, NO LESS.

01:28.750 --> 01:30.708
HE WAS DEPRESSED.
THIS MUCH IS TRUE.

01:30.708 --> 01:32.583
BUT HE GOT UP,
DUSTED HIMSELF OFF,

01:32.583 --> 01:34.083
AND GOT RIGHT
BACK IN THE GAME.

01:34.083 --> 01:37.792
(PRETENDING TO MAKE
STRETCHING GRUNTS)

01:37.792 --> 01:40.208
MEANWHILE,
IN THE TONY HAMPTONS,

01:40.208 --> 01:42.750
MISS JENNIFER LINDLEY
WAS THE RECIPIENT

01:42.750 --> 01:43.875
OF SOME VERY ALARMING NEWS.

01:43.875 --> 01:46.375
MR. AND MRS. THEODORE LINDLEY
SAT THEIR ONLY CHILD DOWN

01:46.375 --> 01:49.667
AND INFORMED HER THAT
THEY WERE GETTING A DIVORCE.

01:50.417 --> 01:53.750
SHE WAS HAPPY...
REALLY, TRULY HAPPY.

01:53.750 --> 01:57.583
SHE THOUGHT IT WAS
THE MOST FUNCTIONAL THING
HER PARENTS HAD EVER DONE.

01:57.583 --> 02:01.583
AND ODDLY ENOUGH, WHAT FOLLOWED
WAS PERHAPS THE BEST SUMMER
OF HER YOUNG LIFE.

02:01.583 --> 02:03.583
AND THEN THERE'S DAWSON.

02:03.583 --> 02:05.583
TRUTH IS, WE DIDN'T TALK
THIS SUMMER.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.625
NOT A WORD.

02:07.625 --> 02:10.458
WHICH IS WEIRD, I GUESS,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, NOT.

02:10.458 --> 02:13.125
I...I KEPT MEANING
TO CALL HIM. I DID.

02:13.125 --> 02:15.500
BUT ONE WEEK
TURNED INTO A MONTH,
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT...

02:15.500 --> 02:17.792
HERE WE ARE, BACK AT SCHOOL.

02:17.792 --> 02:20.667
WHAT DAWSON SAID THAT NIGHT
DEFINITELY RANG TRUE--

02:20.667 --> 02:23.250
MY LIFE IS  WAITING
FOR ME OUT THERE.
I KNOW IT.

02:23.250 --> 02:27.125
AND WHAT'S REALLY COOL
IS THAT I HAVE
ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA

02:27.125 --> 02:29.959
WHAT TO EXPECT.
BUT WHATEVER IT IS...

02:29.959 --> 02:31.375
I'M READY FOR IT.

02:31.375 --> 02:32.542
I'M EXCITED.

02:32.542 --> 02:34.208
BRING IT ON.

03:38.333 --> 03:38.542
WHOA!

03:42.208 --> 03:45.375
WOW. YOU HIT PRETTY HARD
FOR A GIRL.

03:45.375 --> 03:47.333
I'M SO SORRY.
I'M LATE FOR SOMETHING.

03:47.333 --> 03:48.625
EVER HEARD
OF AN ALARM CLOCK?

03:48.625 --> 03:50.750
(SULLENLY)
I SAID I'M SORRY.

03:52.291 --> 03:54.417
YEAH, WELL, SORRY'S
NOT GONNA UNBRUISE MY ASS,
NOW, IS IT?

03:59.291 --> 04:02.208
HI. UM...JOEY POTTER
FOR PROFESSOR HETSON.

04:02.208 --> 04:04.041
I'M...REALLY SORRY
I'M LATE.

04:04.041 --> 04:07.333
OH, NO WORRIES, DEAR.
HE'S RUNNING A BIT LATE
HIMSELF.

04:15.583 --> 04:16.791
FUDGE.

04:25.583 --> 04:26.583
(SIGHS)

04:26.583 --> 04:28.583
(SIGHS)

04:29.458 --> 04:31.291
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
WAKE HIM UP.

04:31.291 --> 04:32.667
DO WE HAVE TO?

04:32.667 --> 04:36.250
LISTEN, I KNOW
YOU WEREN'T THAT KEEN
ON GIVING HIM A RIDE OUT HERE,

04:36.250 --> 04:38.542
BUT WHAT WAS I
SUPPOSED TO DO, PACEY?

04:38.542 --> 04:40.208
I GREW UP
NEXT TO THE KID.

04:40.208 --> 04:43.417
HIS MOM AND DAD WANT HIM
TO GO TO WORTHINGTON.
COME ON.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.542
HE'S NOT THAT BAD,
IS HE?

04:45.542 --> 04:48.417
WELL...APART FROM SHOVING
HIS SOMEWHAT DUBIOUS
MUSICAL TASTE

04:48.417 --> 04:50.834
DOWN MY THROAT,
HE DID TAKE
EVERY OPPORTUNITY

04:50.834 --> 04:52.458
TO TELL ME
HOW MANY TIMES
HE'S SEEN YOU NAKED.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.875
HE'S NEVER SEEN ME NAKED.

04:54.875 --> 04:57.583
REALLY! HE KNOWS
ABOUT THE TATTOO.

04:59.458 --> 05:00.291
WAKE UP, YOU LITTLE PERV!
WHAT THE (BLEEP)?!

05:00.291 --> 05:02.166
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT
YOU SEEING ME NAKED?

05:02.166 --> 05:03.208
WHAT THE (BLEEP)
DID YOU TELL HER?

05:03.208 --> 05:04.250
JUST WHAT
YOU TOLD ME, CHIEF.

05:04.250 --> 05:06.208
THANKS A LOT.
THANKS A (BLEEP) LOT.

05:06.208 --> 05:08.208
I CONFIDE IN YOU,
AND THIS IS WHAT I GET?

05:08.208 --> 05:10.250
I'M LISTENING, JACK.

05:10.250 --> 05:12.291
DO YOU REMEMBER
THE TELESCOPE
IN MY BEDROOM?

05:12.291 --> 05:14.959
WELL, I DIDN'T REALLY
DO MUCH STARGAZING.

05:14.959 --> 05:17.208
I'M SO TELLING
YOUR FATHER ON YOU.
GO AHEAD.

05:17.208 --> 05:18.625
HE HAD A PEEK, TOO.
OH!

05:18.625 --> 05:19.458
BUT DON'T WORRY, HE SAID
REALLY GOOD THINGS.

05:19.458 --> 05:22.250
OK. WELL, THEN,
I'M TELLING YOUR MOTHER,

05:22.250 --> 05:23.792
AND SHE'S GONNA KICK
YOUR ASS, JACK.

05:23.792 --> 05:24.959
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
WHATEVER.

05:24.959 --> 05:26.959
LET ME OUT.
I GOTTA TAKE
A (BLEEP) PISS.

05:26.959 --> 05:28.458
OHHH!

05:28.458 --> 05:29.417
Gahh.

05:31.458 --> 05:32.458
MMM!

05:32.458 --> 05:34.291
MMM.

05:34.291 --> 05:35.291
MMM...

05:35.291 --> 05:36.166
MMM!

05:36.166 --> 05:37.333
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT FOR?

05:37.333 --> 05:39.166
MMM. THE END
IS NIGH, MY DEAR.

05:39.166 --> 05:41.500
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT, WOMAN?

05:41.500 --> 05:44.166
DON'T YOU GET IT, PACEY?
NONE OF THE GREAT COUPLES

05:44.166 --> 05:45.667
EVER MAKE IT
IN THE REAL WORLD--

05:45.667 --> 05:47.959
SID AND NANCY,
BONNIE AND CLYDE,
DAWSON AND JOEY.

05:47.959 --> 05:50.041
HOW THE HELL
DO YOU EVER EXPECT US
TO HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE?

05:50.041 --> 05:50.834
OK, STELLA ADLER,
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?

05:50.834 --> 05:52.000
(SIGHS)

05:52.000 --> 05:54.708
THE SUMMER
IS OVER, PACEY.

05:54.708 --> 05:57.166
THE RETURN TO DULL NORMALCY
BEGINS NOW.

05:57.166 --> 06:00.750
I MEAN, LOOK
AT ALL OF THESE...

06:00.750 --> 06:03.250
CIVILIANS GOING
ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS...

06:03.250 --> 06:05.667
MARCHING OFF TO CLASS,
BUYING THEIR LITTLE BOOKS.

06:05.667 --> 06:06.667
IT'S ENOUGH
TO MAKE A GIRL
WANNA BLOW CHUNKS.

06:06.667 --> 06:10.291
SPEAKING OF,
WHY AREN'T YOU
MARCHIN' OFF WITH 'EM?

06:10.291 --> 06:13.667
BECAUSE NOTHING EVER HAPPENS
ON THE FIRST DAY OF CLASS.

06:13.667 --> 06:13.959
IT'S A TOTAL WASTE.

06:13.959 --> 06:16.083
NATURALLY.

06:19.542 --> 06:20.917
DID YOU HAVE
A NICE SUMMER, PACEY?

06:23.583 --> 06:24.500
I HAD
A FANTASTIC SUMMER.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.708
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR SHOWING ME
YOUR L.A.

06:26.708 --> 06:28.041
AND THANK YOU
FOR INTRODUCING ME
TO YOUR FATHER,

06:28.041 --> 06:31.125
WITHOUT WHOM I WOULDN'T
HAVE A SINGLE JOB
PROSPECT AT THE MOMENT.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.291
YEAH, YOU WANT
TO KNOW SOMETHING?

06:32.291 --> 06:35.125
YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED
TO ACTUALLY IMPRESS
MY FATHER, PACEY.

06:35.125 --> 06:36.875
WHAT WAS I
SUPPOSE TO DO,
CREEP THE GUY OUT?

06:36.875 --> 06:37.500
YES. BUT THAT'S
NOT THE POINT.

06:37.500 --> 06:39.708
REALLY?
WHAT'S THE POINT?

06:39.708 --> 06:41.583
THE POINT IS THAT
I DON'T WANT YOU

06:41.583 --> 06:43.959
TO TURN INTO SOME LAME
9-TO-5er ON ME, PACEY.

06:46.375 --> 06:48.208
WELL, I'LL...TRY,
MISS LIDDELL,

06:48.208 --> 06:49.208
BUT I DO
ACTUALLY NEED A JOB,

06:49.208 --> 06:51.500
AND IT WOULD BE NICE
TO HAVE JUST

06:51.500 --> 06:54.000
A LITTLE BIT
OF DISPOSABLE CASH
FOR A CHANGE.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.375
WE LIVE IN A CITY
WITH, LIKE, 8 MILLION
RESTAURANTS.

06:56.375 --> 06:57.375
TAKE YOUR PICK.

06:57.375 --> 06:58.250
OR MAYBE I WANT
SOMETHING BETTER FOR MYSELF.

06:58.250 --> 07:01.041
PERHAPS PACEY
ACTUALLY WANTS

07:01.041 --> 07:02.542
HIS VERY OWN SHOT
AT GREATNESS.

07:05.375 --> 07:06.667
BESIDES, THE PARTY
CAN'T GO ON
FOREVER, BABY.

07:09.208 --> 07:11.250
BLAH BLAH,
BLAH BLAH,
BLAH BLAH.

07:11.250 --> 07:13.125
WILL YOU BRING
MY BAGS IN?

07:13.125 --> 07:14.750
YES.

07:15.583 --> 07:19.166
OK.

07:19.166 --> 07:20.750
(CHUCKLES)

07:20.750 --> 07:23.417
WHAT?

07:23.417 --> 07:25.333
I--I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU SAID FUDGE.

07:25.333 --> 07:29.333
OH. IT JUST...
KIND OF CAME OUT.

07:29.333 --> 07:30.375
I MEAN, IT'S SO SILLY.

07:30.375 --> 07:32.291
EVEN DORIS,
MY SECRETARY,

07:32.291 --> 07:33.583
WOULD PROBABLY GO
FOR THE MORE HARD-CORE

07:33.583 --> 07:34.750
VERSION OF MY FAVORITE
EXPLETIVE.

07:34.750 --> 07:37.708
WELL, DORIS IS CLEARLY
A TOUGH BROAD.

07:37.708 --> 07:38.583
UH-HUH.

07:38.583 --> 07:39.583
HEY, TOMORROW'S
YOUR BIRTHDAY.

07:41.125 --> 07:42.125
THAT'S RIGHT.

07:42.125 --> 07:43.667
ANY BIG PLANS?

07:43.667 --> 07:44.208
UH, NO.

07:44.208 --> 07:47.500
OH,
IT'S JUST AS WELL.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.500
YOU DON'T HAVE
MUCH TO CELEBRATE.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.875
IT SAYS HERE THAT,
UH, YOUR SCHOLARSHIP

07:50.875 --> 07:52.291
BARELY COVERS
YOUR TUITION.

07:52.291 --> 07:54.000
DO YOU HAVE A JOB?
UH, NO.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.458
ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR ONE?
YES.

07:55.458 --> 07:57.458
THERE'S AN OPENING
IN THE ENGLISH
DEPARTMENT.

07:57.458 --> 07:59.166
RESEARCH ASSISTANT.

07:59.166 --> 08:00.208
YOU INTERESTED?

08:00.208 --> 08:02.333
SURE, MAYBE.

08:02.333 --> 08:03.625
"SURE, MAYBE."

08:03.625 --> 08:04.708
THIS IS A JOB, JOEY,

08:04.708 --> 08:06.708
THAT STUDENTS
STAB EACH OTHER
IN THE BACK FOR.

08:06.708 --> 08:08.458
THINK ABOUT IT.
LET ME KNOW.

08:08.458 --> 08:12.291
OH, NOW, THIS--
THIS IS A PROBLEM.

08:12.291 --> 08:13.250
WHAT?

08:13.250 --> 08:14.834
IT SAYS HERE
YOU'RE SIGNED UP
FOR MY LIT CLASS.

08:14.834 --> 08:16.875
OH, YEAH, I...

08:16.875 --> 08:18.333
THOUGHT IT LOOKED
INTERESTING.

08:18.333 --> 08:19.667
IT'S ALSO
A LITTLE ADVANCED
FOR A SOPHOMORE.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.166
OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T
KNOW ME, PROFESSOR HETSON,

08:22.166 --> 08:23.834
BECAUSE, IF YOU DID,
YOU WOULD REALIZE

08:23.834 --> 08:25.083
THAT MY SOPHOMORE STATUS,

08:25.083 --> 08:27.000
IT'S A TOTAL NON-ISSUE.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.834
UM, BESIDES, I'VE READ
MOST OF THE BOOKS
ON THE READING LIST.

08:30.834 --> 08:32.457
HOW ABOUT
LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN?
DID YOU READ THAT BOOK?

08:34.792 --> 08:36.958
LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN.

08:36.958 --> 08:38.625
UM...

08:41.625 --> 08:42.667
I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL.

08:42.667 --> 08:44.625
YOU FINISH IT
BEFORE THE FIRST CLASS

08:44.625 --> 08:46.166
AND I'LL TRY
AND FORGET THE FACT

08:46.166 --> 08:50.083
THAT YOU'RE JUST
A LOWLY SOPHOMORE. OK?

08:50.083 --> 08:51.458
OK.

08:52.250 --> 08:55.875
WAIT--BEFORE
THE FIRST CLASS?

08:55.875 --> 08:57.333
THE FIRST CLASS
IS TODAY.

08:57.333 --> 08:58.750
THAT'S RIGHT.
AT 3:00.

08:58.750 --> 09:00.083
YEAH.
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

09:04.250 --> 09:06.834
NOTHING. FORGET IT.

09:07.417 --> 09:09.458
GOOD MORNING,
GRANDMOTHER.

09:09.458 --> 09:11.125
GOOD MORNING,
GRANDDAUGHTER.

09:11.125 --> 09:14.542
GRAMS, DO YOU NOTICE
ANYTHING DIFFERENT
ABOUT ME THIS MORNING?

09:14.542 --> 09:16.041
NO.

09:16.041 --> 09:19.125
WELL, AS IT
JUST SO HAPPENS,
I'M HAPPY.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.959
TODAY'S THE FIRST DAY
OF MY SOPHOMORE YEAR

09:20.959 --> 09:22.542
AND, REALLY,
I COULDN'T BE MORE PLEASED.

09:22.542 --> 09:23.583
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE NOTICED THIS,

09:23.583 --> 09:24.583
BUT I'M GENERALLY
A DOUR SORT.

09:24.583 --> 09:27.542
NO. REALLY?
I WASN'T AWARE OF THAT.

09:27.542 --> 09:30.750
YES, AND WHILE
I'M STILL SOMEWHAT
DISGUSTED WITH LIFE,

09:30.750 --> 09:32.333
I FIND MYSELF
SUDDENLY HAPPY
TO BE HERE.

09:32.333 --> 09:35.208
WELL, THAT'S--
THAT'S NICE, DEAR.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.291
YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK IT IS?

09:36.291 --> 09:40.333
I THINK
THAT THE DISILLUSION
OF THE LINDLEY MARRIAGE

09:40.333 --> 09:43.542
HAS ACTUALLY RESTORED
MY FAITH IN HUMANITY.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.041
I MEAN, IF THOSE 2 LOONS
CAN TAKE STEPS

09:45.041 --> 09:46.917
TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY
OF THEIR LIVES

09:46.917 --> 09:48.792
AND--AND THE LIVES
OF THOSE AROUND THEM,

09:48.792 --> 09:50.125
THEN ANYTHING
IS POSSIBLE.

09:51.750 --> 09:54.000
WHAT?
WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.250
IF YOU'VE EATEN HER
I WANT YOU TO SPIT HER
OUT THIS INSTANT.

09:56.250 --> 10:00.125
(TELEPHONE RINGS)

10:03.083 --> 10:05.583
HELLO?

10:05.583 --> 10:08.917
OH, HELLO,
MR. SMALLS.

10:08.917 --> 10:11.000
NO, I DON'T
HAVE ANY PLANS.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.333
I'D LOVE
TO ACCOMPANY YOU
TO TEA

10:13.333 --> 10:14.583
AT THE BOSTON
MUSEUM OF ART.

10:14.583 --> 10:18.041
OH, MY. OH, MY.
THAT WOULD JUST
BE LOVELY.

10:29.125 --> 10:30.250
HEY, YOU.

10:30.250 --> 10:31.792
OH, JOEY. THANK GOD.

10:31.792 --> 10:33.542
LOOK, THERE'S NO TIME
RIGHT NOW, BUT,

10:33.542 --> 10:34.875
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS
IN THE NEXT 30 SECONDS,

10:34.875 --> 10:36.166
NO MATTER WHAT I SAY
OR WHAT I DO,

10:36.166 --> 10:39.000
YOU DO NOT  WANT ME
TO CRASH HERE WITH YOU GUYS.

10:39.000 --> 10:39.750
GOT IT? JUST--HI.

10:39.750 --> 10:42.417
JOEY POTTER,
AS I LIVE AND BREATHE.

10:42.417 --> 10:44.959
MY NEMESIS.
WELCOME BACK.

10:44.959 --> 10:45.750
THANK YOU.
HEY, CAN, UM,

10:45.750 --> 10:49.458
PACEY STAY WITH US
FOR A COUPLE DAYS?

10:49.458 --> 10:50.750
Joey: UM...

10:50.750 --> 10:53.208
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:53.208 --> 10:54.625
NOW IS NOT REALLY
THE BEST TIME. UH...

10:54.625 --> 10:57.667
I'VE GOT A LOT
OF STUDYING TO DO, AND,

10:57.667 --> 10:59.250
WELL, I MEAN,
YOU KNOW PACEY.

10:59.250 --> 11:00.708
I MEAN, HE'S KIND OF
LIKE A CHILD.

11:00.708 --> 11:01.458
IF HE DOESN'T GET
ENOUGH ATTENTION,
HE STARTS TO ACT OUT,

11:01.458 --> 11:04.625
AND THEN THERE'S
THE BURPING,

11:04.625 --> 11:05.792
THE FARTING,
THE CHRONIC HAL--

11:05.792 --> 11:06.208
IT'S DISGUSTING,
REALLY.

11:06.208 --> 11:08.125
DON'T I KNOW IT.

11:08.125 --> 11:09.667
HEY, I'M STANDING
RIGHT HERE.

11:09.667 --> 11:10.834
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T
BE A PARTY TO IT.

11:10.834 --> 11:13.125
I UNDERSTAND.
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
IT LOOKS LIKE

11:13.125 --> 11:14.625
YOU'RE SHACKING UP
WITH GRAMS, AMIGO.

11:14.625 --> 11:15.959
WELL, THAT'S JUST GREAT.

11:15.959 --> 11:18.875
YOU KNOW, AFTER
ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
TOGETHER, JOEY,

11:18.875 --> 11:21.000
I REALLY THOUGHT
YOU'D BE COOLER
ABOUT THIS.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.125
I'M ACTUALLY
A LITTLE HURT.

11:22.125 --> 11:23.750
WELL, WHEN YOU
PUT IT THAT WAY--

11:23.750 --> 11:25.291
OH, NO. NO, NO, NO.

11:25.291 --> 11:26.708
DON'T YOU TRY
TO WEASEL OUT OF THIS NOW.

11:26.708 --> 11:27.959
THE DAMAGE IS DONE.
LET'S GO, LIDDELL.

11:30.708 --> 11:32.417
OH, HEY!
WHAT ARE WE
DOING TONIGHT?

11:32.417 --> 11:34.750
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
WE COULD GO OUT
AND CELEBRATE.

11:34.750 --> 11:37.583
AH, YOU WANT TO CELEBRATE
MY RETURN TO WORTHINGTON?

11:37.583 --> 11:39.208
THAT IS SO SWEET, JOEY.

11:39.208 --> 11:40.583
RIGHT, 'CAUSE
THAT'S THE ONLY THING

11:40.583 --> 11:43.000
WE COULD
POTENTIALLY CELEBRATE.

11:43.000 --> 11:43.875
OBVIOUSLY.

11:43.875 --> 11:45.708
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
LATER, BUNNY.

12:00.417 --> 12:02.250
(TELEPHONE RINGS)

12:05.708 --> 12:08.458
Dawson, on voice mail:
JOEY. HEY, IT'S ME, DAWSON.

12:08.458 --> 12:11.041
LONG TIME,
NO TALK, HUH? HEH.

12:11.041 --> 12:14.667
UH, LISTEN,
I'M IN TOWN, ACTUALLY,
FOR THE WEEKEND.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.166
UM, I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU WANTED
TO GET TOGETHER,

12:16.166 --> 12:17.834
MAYBE FOR, UH,
SOME COFFEE OR SOMETHING.

12:17.834 --> 12:19.375
British guy: GET OFF
THE BLOODY PHONE, LEERY!

12:19.375 --> 12:21.000
I'M NOT PAYING YOU
TO CHAT UP SOME BIRD!

12:21.000 --> 12:22.083
HOLD ON.
ONE SECOND, TODD.

12:22.083 --> 12:23.875
UH, JOEY,
IF YOU GET THIS,

12:23.875 --> 12:26.333
MEET ME AT 2:00
AT, UM, THIS COFFEE SHOP.

12:26.333 --> 12:28.792
PALEO SUN.
IT'S ON THE CORNER
OF FRONT AND PRINCESS.

12:28.792 --> 12:30.542
OK? I GOTTA GO. BYE.

12:30.542 --> 12:31.000
British guy: LEERY!

12:45.000 --> 12:46.625
Sportscaster: NUMBER 7
TAKES THE OFFENSE

12:46.625 --> 12:48.750
TO THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE
ON THIS BIG--

12:48.750 --> 12:50.750
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:51.708 --> 12:52.542
YEAH. YEAH,
THAT'S, UH,

12:52.542 --> 12:54.708
PRETTY SLICK, DUDE.
NICE FIT.

12:54.708 --> 12:56.458
LOOKS BETTER ON YOU,
ACTUALLY, THAN IT DOES ON ME.

12:56.458 --> 12:57.834
YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S TOO FLASHY, DO YOU?

12:57.834 --> 12:59.458
UH...WHAT'S THE JOB AGAIN?

12:59.458 --> 13:01.083
WELL,
I'M SELLING STOCKS.

13:01.083 --> 13:02.250
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT SELLING STOCKS?

13:02.250 --> 13:04.333
NOT A DAMN THING,
BUT AUDREY'S FATHER

13:04.333 --> 13:05.542
SEEMS TO THINK
I'D BE GOOD AT IT.

13:05.542 --> 13:06.792
HE TOLD ME I'M
A NATURAL BORN HUSTLER
AND I SHOULD

13:06.792 --> 13:08.250
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT
WHILE I CAN.

13:08.250 --> 13:09.917
WELL, YOU GOT TO ADMIT,
PACE, YOU DO POSSESS

13:09.917 --> 13:11.917
THE APPROPRIATE DEGREE
OF OBNOXIOUSNESS

13:11.917 --> 13:13.291
FOR THAT PARTICULAR
VOCATION.

13:13.291 --> 13:15.000
THANKS, PAL.
MM-HMM.

13:17.125 --> 13:18.375
(SIGHS)

13:20.792 --> 13:23.291
SO, THIS IS LIFE
AT GRAM'S HOUSE, HUH?

13:23.291 --> 13:25.417
YEAH.
I HAVE A GOOD LIFE.

13:26.291 --> 13:28.417
IT'S KIND OF...

13:28.417 --> 13:29.625
LAME?

13:30.917 --> 13:32.291
I WAS GONNA
SAY QUAINT,
BUT, YEAH,

13:32.291 --> 13:33.417
LAME PRETTY MUCH
SUMS IT UP. YEAH.

13:33.417 --> 13:36.208
PLUS, IT'S GETTING
INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT
TO HAVE A LIFE,

13:36.208 --> 13:37.166
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

13:37.166 --> 13:38.000
OH, YEAH.
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

13:40.250 --> 13:41.291
NO, I DON'T.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13:41.291 --> 13:42.959
COME ON, YOU KNOW.

13:42.959 --> 13:44.125
YOU MEET SOMEBODY,
YOU LIKE THEM,

13:44.125 --> 13:46.125
YOU WANT TO TAKE THEM
SOMEPLACE A BIT
MORE INTIMATE--

13:46.125 --> 13:48.834
OH. MMM.

13:48.834 --> 13:50.458
YOU PROBABLY DON'T
WANT TO HEAR THE REST, SO--

13:50.458 --> 13:51.542
WELL, DON'T CENSOR
YOURSELF ON MY ACCOUNT.

13:51.542 --> 13:52.792
I MEAN, PACEY WITTER
IS NOTHING

13:52.792 --> 13:55.458
IF NOT A CARD-CARRYING
FRIEND OF THE GAY.

13:55.458 --> 13:58.083
YEAH.

13:59.583 --> 14:01.625
YOU EVER THINK
ABOUT GETTING
A PLACE OF YOUR OWN?

14:01.625 --> 14:04.625
YEAH. ALL THE TIME.
JUST CAN'T AFFORD IT.

14:04.625 --> 14:07.000
RIGHT, AND NEITHER
CAN I, BUT...

14:07.000 --> 14:09.125
WHAT IF YOU AND I
WERE TO GET
A PLACE TOGETHER?

14:09.125 --> 14:12.041
YOU AND ME, ROOMMATES?
SURE. WHY NOT?

14:12.041 --> 14:12.583
I CAN THINK OF ABOUT
A MILLION REASONS WHY NOT.

14:12.583 --> 14:16.000
NAME ONE.
WELL...

14:16.000 --> 14:17.125
CAN I GET BACK
TO YOU ON THAT?

14:17.125 --> 14:18.875
OK, I'M FINDING US
A PLACE.

14:33.750 --> 14:35.250
IS THIS ART HISTORY?

14:35.250 --> 14:36.291
OHH!

14:39.500 --> 14:40.834
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

14:40.834 --> 14:41.959
SAME THING
YOU ARE, DEAR.

14:44.041 --> 14:45.375
WHAT,
YOU'RE IN MY CLASS?

14:45.375 --> 14:47.583
MM-HMM.

14:47.583 --> 14:48.792
OH, THIS IS
SO UNCOOL.

14:48.792 --> 14:51.041
I TRIED TO TELL YOU
THIS MORNING,

14:51.041 --> 14:51.917
BUT YOU WERE
JUST PRATTLING
ON AND ON

14:51.917 --> 14:55.750
AND I COULD BARELY GET
A WORD IN EDGEWISE.

14:55.750 --> 14:56.875
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

14:56.875 --> 15:00.125
WELL, I ATTENDED
ONE OF CLIFTON'S
SUMMER SCHOOL CLASSES

15:00.125 --> 15:01.125
AND IT WAS
SUCH A DELIGHT.

15:01.125 --> 15:04.000
I'D FORGOTTEN
HOW MUCH I ENJOYED
THE CLASSROOM,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.542
SO I DECIDED
RIGHT THERE AND THEN

15:06.542 --> 15:07.834
TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

15:07.834 --> 15:09.417
GREAT. SO NOT ONLY
ARE YOU GOING

15:09.417 --> 15:10.750
TO EMBARRASS ME
INTO AN EARLY GRAVE,

15:10.750 --> 15:12.166
BUT YOU'RE
ALSO DOING THIS
FOR A MAN?

15:12.166 --> 15:14.792
JENNIFER,
GIVE AN OLD WOMAN
SOME CREDIT.

15:14.792 --> 15:16.083
I AM DOING THIS
FOR MYSELF.

15:16.083 --> 15:19.417
OK, FINE, BUT WHY
DID IT HAVE TO BE
ART HISTORY?

15:19.417 --> 15:21.375
WHY CAN'T YOU
TAKE A NICE
LITTLE MATH CLASS?

15:21.375 --> 15:22.000
YOU KNOW,
FROM WHAT I HEAR

15:22.000 --> 15:23.667
USING THAT PART
OF THE BRAIN

15:23.667 --> 15:24.667
HELPS THE ELDERLY
STAVE OFF

15:24.667 --> 15:26.000
THE EARLY ONSET
OF ALZHEIMERS.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.834
LADIES, AM I GONNA HAVE
TO SEPARATE YOU TWO?

15:36.083 --> 15:39.166
(DRUMS PLAYING)

15:40.417 --> 15:42.375
(KNOCKS)

15:46.583 --> 15:48.458
HI.
HEY. EMMA.

15:48.458 --> 15:50.458
PACEY.

15:50.458 --> 15:52.291
COME ON IN THEN,
PACEY.

15:52.291 --> 15:54.041
THANKS.

15:54.375 --> 15:55.875
WOW.

15:55.875 --> 15:58.500
EMMA, THIS PLACE
IS FANTASTIC.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.542
YEAH, IT IS.
EXPENSIVE, TOO.

16:00.542 --> 16:02.208
(TAPPING DRUMS)

16:04.834 --> 16:05.750
THESE YOURS?

16:05.750 --> 16:07.125
UH, NO, THEY'RE
MY BOYFRIEND'S.

16:07.125 --> 16:09.875
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
IT'S SO F-ing
IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE

16:09.875 --> 16:10.875
THAT A GIRL
COULD PLAY
A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT

16:10.875 --> 16:13.125
THAT THEY MUST BE
SOMEONE ELSE'S, RIGHT?

16:13.125 --> 16:14.542
THAT'S NOT WHAT I--

16:14.542 --> 16:16.250
I GOT A BIT
OF FOOT-IN-MOUTH DISEASE.

16:16.250 --> 16:18.083
BUT IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,
YOU SOUNDED GREAT.

16:18.083 --> 16:19.458
LIKE I SAID,
THE PLACE IS EXPENSIVE.

16:19.458 --> 16:20.500
ARE YOU A STUDENT?

16:20.500 --> 16:22.750
NO, NO. YOU?

16:22.750 --> 16:24.125
YEAH. BERKLEE
SCHOOL OF MUSIC.

16:24.125 --> 16:24.625
THE DRUMS.
YEAH.

16:24.625 --> 16:25.834
RIGHT.
YOU HAVE A JOB?

16:25.834 --> 16:28.667
UH, ACTUALLY,
NO, NOT REALLY--

16:28.667 --> 16:30.667
WELL, IT WAS LOVELY
TO MEET YOU, PACEY.

16:30.667 --> 16:33.000
OH, NO, NO, NO.
I HAVE THIS HUGE
JOB INTERVIEW TOMORROW.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.792
IF THAT COUNTS
FOR ANYTHING.
DOES IT?

16:34.792 --> 16:38.792
OK. EMMA, YOU HAVE
A FANTASTIC PLACE HERE.

16:38.792 --> 16:39.917
AND IF YOU
GAVE ME A CHANCE

16:39.917 --> 16:41.125
I'M PRETTY SURE
I COULD SWING IT

16:41.125 --> 16:42.542
'CAUSE I ALSO HAVE
ANOTHER FRIEND
WHO'S LOOKING--

16:42.542 --> 16:43.375
ANOTHER GUY?
YEAH, A GREAT GUY.

16:43.375 --> 16:44.834
NO, LIVING WITH GUYS
IS A TERRIBLE IDEA.

16:44.834 --> 16:47.458
IT ALWAYS ENDS
IN DISASTER.

16:47.458 --> 16:49.959
I HAVE A LESBIAN COUPLE
COMING OVER TO LOOK AT
THE PLACE AGAIN TOMORROW,

16:49.959 --> 16:52.834
AND BOTH DEBBIE
AND DONNA ARE
GAINFULLY EMPLOYED.

16:52.834 --> 16:54.750
BUT DO YOU THINK
THEY COULD HELP YOU
WITH THE DRUM KIT

16:54.750 --> 16:55.625
DOWN THE STAIRS
EVERY TIME YOU HAVE A GIG?

16:55.625 --> 16:57.834
FROM THE LOOK
OF THEM, YEAH,
THEY COULD.

16:57.834 --> 17:00.000
AND THEY LOOK
BETTER THAN YOU,
IN FACT.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.959
OK, I CAN TAKE THAT.

17:01.959 --> 17:02.792
IF YOU NEED
TO EMASCULATE ME
THAT'S FINE,

17:02.792 --> 17:04.708
BUT GIVE ME A CHANCE.

17:04.708 --> 17:05.750
LET ME BRING JACK BY,
INTRODUCE YOU.

17:05.750 --> 17:08.375
LOOK, I'M SURE THIS JACK
IS A WORLD-CLASS CHARMER,

17:08.375 --> 17:10.208
BUT IT'S REALLY
NOT NECESSARY.

17:10.208 --> 17:11.416
I'M NOT REALLY UNDERSTANDING
WHAT IT IS

17:11.416 --> 17:12.625
THAT YOU'RE
SO FEARFUL OF HERE.

17:12.625 --> 17:13.625
IS IT THE SEXUAL
TENSION THING?

17:13.625 --> 17:15.165
'CAUSE I KNOW
THAT COULD BE AWKWARD,

17:15.165 --> 17:16.834
TWO GUYS AND A GIRL
LIVING TOGETHER,

17:16.834 --> 17:18.000
BUT I CAN PRETTY MUCH
GUARANTEE YOU

17:18.000 --> 17:19.834
THAT THERE IS
ABSOLUTELY NO POSSIBILITY

17:19.834 --> 17:22.000
OF EITHER JACK OR MYSELF
FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU

17:22.000 --> 17:23.040
BECAUSE IT--

17:23.040 --> 17:26.959
BECAUSE--
THAT DIDN'T COME OUT RIGHT.

17:26.959 --> 17:27.916
BUT THERE'S A GOOD REASON.
LET ME TRY AGAIN.

17:27.916 --> 17:30.250
LOOK, IT WON'T
BE NECESSARY.

17:30.250 --> 17:30.750
NO, WHAT I'M SAYING
IS THAT NEITHER--

17:30.750 --> 17:33.458
BUGGER OFF, CHUM.

17:41.792 --> 17:43.166
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:43.166 --> 17:45.208
I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE
THAT GRAMS ISN'T

17:45.208 --> 17:47.041
IN THIS CLASS, TOO.

17:47.041 --> 17:48.375
COME ON.
GIVE THE OLD GIRL
A BREAK.

17:48.375 --> 17:52.208
BESIDES, I DON'T
THINK THE HISTORY
OF POP CULTURE

17:52.208 --> 17:53.917
IS EXACTLY
HER SPEED.

17:53.917 --> 17:54.834
WHO KNOWS?
THE WOMAN'S CRAZY.

17:54.834 --> 17:58.625
LIKE A FOX.
OK, OK. I--

17:58.625 --> 17:59.834
WHOA.

17:59.834 --> 18:01.500
WHAT?
(CLEARS THROAT)

18:05.291 --> 18:06.750
(WHISPERS)
Oh, he's beautiful.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.166
YEAH.
WHAT YOU SAID.

18:13.625 --> 18:15.583
WELCOME,
FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS,

18:15.583 --> 18:17.417
TO WHAT I HOPE WILL BE
AN ENJOYABLE SEMESTER.

18:17.417 --> 18:20.417
I'M BETTING YOU GUYS
THINK IT'S GONNA BE
AN EASY RIDE.

18:20.417 --> 18:21.083
AND WHEN YOU LOOK
AT SOME OF THE THINGS

18:21.083 --> 18:23.417
WE'RE GOING
TO BE STUDYING--

18:23.417 --> 18:25.125
THINGS LIKE THE FILMS
OF KEANU REEVES,

18:25.125 --> 18:27.208
THE RISE OF THE WB,

18:27.208 --> 18:30.166
AND WHY REALITY TV SHOWS
ARE BAD FOR THE SOUL--

18:30.166 --> 18:30.708
(WHISPERS)
Do you think he's gay?

18:30.708 --> 18:33.917
You're asking me?

18:33.917 --> 18:35.917
Come on,
I got the worst
gaydar going.

18:35.917 --> 18:38.166
I think he's gay.
How much you wanna bet?

18:38.166 --> 18:42.959
How about $1 million?

18:42.959 --> 18:44.250
Done.
All right.

18:44.250 --> 18:47.917
I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER
ANY QUESTIONS AT ANY TIME.

18:47.917 --> 18:50.917
TRUTH BE TOLD,
I'M PRETTY MUCH
JUST LIKE YOU GUYS.

18:50.917 --> 18:52.125
A POP CULTURE JUNKIE.

18:52.125 --> 18:54.834
MY WIFE THINKS
I WATCH TOO MUCH TV,

18:54.834 --> 18:56.875
AND SHE'S PROBABLY RIGHT,

18:56.875 --> 18:59.000
BUT I HAVE
A BUILT-IN EXCUSE.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.792
IT'S MY JOB.

19:00.792 --> 19:02.125
How do you want it?

19:02.125 --> 19:03.291
Hundreds.

19:03.291 --> 19:06.250
I'm all about
the Benjamins,
baby.

19:34.792 --> 19:36.750
LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN
IS CONSIDERED A CLASSIC

19:36.750 --> 19:38.500
OF POST-WAR
AMERICAN WRITING.

19:38.500 --> 19:39.500
THERE ARE IN MY--

19:42.500 --> 19:43.667
HELLO.

19:43.667 --> 19:47.417
HOW ARE YOU?

19:47.417 --> 19:48.333
GOOD.

19:48.333 --> 19:50.250
HAVE A SEAT,
PLEASE.

19:55.333 --> 19:57.041
CAN WE GET YOU ANYTHING?

19:57.041 --> 19:59.000
MAKE SURE THAT SEAT'S OK
'CAUSE THERE SEEM TO BE

19:59.000 --> 20:00.291
SOME AVAILABLE
OVER THERE.

20:02.750 --> 20:03.834
THIS IS FINE.

20:03.834 --> 20:05.917
WHERE WAS I? OH.

20:05.917 --> 20:08.333
RIGHT.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.208
LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN
IS CONSIDERED A CLASSIC

20:10.208 --> 20:10.792
OF POST-WAR
AMERICAN WRITING.

20:10.792 --> 20:11.750
THERE ARE--

20:11.750 --> 20:16.250
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

20:25.375 --> 20:26.750
IF YOU CAN'T
MAKE IT STOP,

20:26.750 --> 20:27.875
WILL YOU JUST
ANSWER IT ALREADY?

20:27.875 --> 20:29.083
I DON'T WANT
TO BE RUDE.

20:29.708 --> 20:31.583
FINE.

20:31.583 --> 20:34.375
YOU DON'T WANT
TO ANSWER IT,
I WILL.

20:34.375 --> 20:36.125
HELLO?
WHO'S THIS?

20:36.125 --> 20:36.875
AUDREY.

20:36.875 --> 20:40.834
NO, THIS IS
PROFESSOR GREG HETSON.

20:40.834 --> 20:42.500
NO, JOEY CAN'T COME
TO THE PHONE RIGHT NOW.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.667
BUT IS THERE ANY MESSAGE
YOU'D LIKE FOR ME TO RELAY?

20:45.667 --> 20:48.375
SURE. YEAH. NO, OK.
I GOT IT.

20:48.375 --> 20:50.583
YEAH, RIGHT BACK AT YOU.

20:55.417 --> 20:58.750
SO, WHERE WERE WE?
(CLEARS THROAT)

20:58.750 --> 21:01.750
YOU KNOW WHAT?
BEFORE I FORGET, JOEY,

21:01.750 --> 21:04.208
TURNS OUT DAWSON
COULDN'T MAKE IT.

21:04.208 --> 21:05.417
HE WAS A LITTLE CRAZED,

21:05.417 --> 21:07.291
BUT HE WANTS TO MEET YOU
AND THE GANG

21:07.291 --> 21:09.917
AT HELL'S KITCHEN
AT, LIKE, 8:30. OK?

21:09.917 --> 21:11.625
Joey: THANKS.
MY PLEASURE.

21:11.625 --> 21:13.792
SO, WHERE WERE WE?

21:13.792 --> 21:14.667
RIGHT, OK.

21:14.667 --> 21:18.875
LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN.
ANY THOUGHTS?

21:22.667 --> 21:23.875
JOEY?

21:27.667 --> 21:29.917
UH...

21:33.500 --> 21:37.792
HONESTLY THE TRUTH IS
I ONLY HAD A CHANCE TO READ

21:37.792 --> 21:38.959
ONE OF THE VIGNETTES.

21:38.959 --> 21:41.625
JOEY...

21:41.625 --> 21:42.959
IT'S THE FIRST DAY
OF CLASS

21:42.959 --> 21:44.792
AND ALREADY
YOU'VE BROKEN A PROMISE.

21:44.792 --> 21:46.834
I'M SORRY, BUT--

21:46.834 --> 21:49.583
ACTION, JOEY.

21:49.583 --> 21:49.625
NOT EXCUSES.

21:53.750 --> 21:55.834
SO, UH...

21:55.834 --> 21:57.417
WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF WHAT YOU DID
MANAGE TO READ?

22:02.834 --> 22:04.625
I THOUGHT THAT
IT WAS HEARTBREAKING.

22:04.625 --> 22:07.083
UM...

22:07.083 --> 22:10.792
I MEAN, THE PEOPLE,
THEY'RE...DOOMED.

22:10.792 --> 22:14.041
IT'S LIKE A WORLD
WHERE THE SUN NEVER SHINES.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.625
(MAN SCOFFS)

22:19.125 --> 22:20.792
Hetson: YOU.

22:20.792 --> 22:22.500
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

22:22.500 --> 22:24.125
HELLO?

22:24.125 --> 22:24.959
RIGHT, YEAH.
EDDIE.

22:24.959 --> 22:26.875
MY NAME'S EDDIE.

22:26.875 --> 22:28.125
EDDIE. HI, EDDIE.

22:28.125 --> 22:28.834
WHAT'S YOUR BEEF, EDDIE?

22:28.834 --> 22:31.166
I GOT NO BEEF.

22:31.166 --> 22:34.041
OH, NO, THAT'S CRAP.
I SENSE AN OPPOSING VIEWPOINT.

22:34.041 --> 22:38.250
NO, NO, I JUST,
UH--

22:38.250 --> 22:40.208
JUST, UH...

22:40.208 --> 22:41.375
WELL, COME ON.
OUT WITH IT.

22:41.375 --> 22:45.125
I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S
A LITTLE CONDESCENDING

22:45.125 --> 22:47.000
TO FEEL SORRY
FOR THESE PEOPLE.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.291
I MEAN, WHO SAYS
THERE CAN'T BE BEAUTY

22:49.291 --> 22:50.667
IN A WORLD WHERE
THE SUN DOESN'T SHINE?

22:50.667 --> 22:51.834
YOU'VE READ THE WHOLE  BOOK,
HAVEN'T YOU, EDDIE?

22:51.834 --> 22:53.750
YEAH.

22:53.750 --> 22:54.667
YEARS AGO.
IT'S AWESOME.

22:54.667 --> 22:58.792
WELL, YOU'VE GOT ONE UP
ON MS. POTTER, ANYWAY.

22:58.792 --> 22:59.917
SO, MOVING ON.

23:16.667 --> 23:18.875
OOH!
I'M SO SORRY. HI.

23:18.875 --> 23:21.125
YOU AGAIN.

23:21.125 --> 23:22.708
WELL, THIS HAS GOT TO BE
SOME KIND OF SIGN,
DON'T YOU THINK?

23:22.708 --> 23:25.875
I THINK
IT'S MORE LIKE AN OMEN
OF BAD THINGS TO COME.

23:25.875 --> 23:27.542
WHO'S THIS?

23:27.542 --> 23:28.792
THIS, MY DEAR,
IS MS. EMMA JONES.

23:28.792 --> 23:31.208
THE ONE WHO HAS
THAT FANTASTIC APARTMENT
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

23:31.208 --> 23:32.667
OH, RIGHT.

23:32.667 --> 23:34.792
AND THIS, MS. EMMA JONES,

23:34.792 --> 23:36.792
IS MY SWEETHEART
OF A GIRLFRIEND AUDREY.

23:36.792 --> 23:38.083
KEY WORD BEING
"GIRLFRIEND."

23:38.083 --> 23:39.250
WHAT ARE YOU GOING ON
ABOUT, EXACTLY?

23:39.250 --> 23:41.083
THAT I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

23:41.083 --> 23:42.583
RIGHT HERE. A BEAUTIFUL,
WONDERFUL GIRLFRIEND.

23:42.583 --> 23:43.125
GOOD FOR YOU, MATE.

23:43.125 --> 23:45.375
BUT I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

23:45.375 --> 23:47.375
SO YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

23:47.375 --> 23:49.375
NOT REALLY, NO.
OK, YOU TELL HER.

23:49.375 --> 23:50.458
TELL HER WHAT?

23:50.458 --> 23:51.291
TELL HER
WHAT A GOOD GUY I AM.

23:51.291 --> 23:52.458
WHAT A GREAT ROOMMATE
I WOULD MAKE.

23:52.458 --> 23:54.583
I'M NOT TELLING
HER ANYTHING.
SHE'S HOT.

23:54.583 --> 23:55.000
WELL, THANK YOU.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.917
YOU'RE WELCOME.

23:56.917 --> 23:57.542
I DON'T WANT YOU
LIVING WITH
A HOT GIRL.

23:59.875 --> 24:01.542
YOU TWO SEEM TO GET ALONG.
THAT'S GREAT.

24:01.542 --> 24:03.041
CHANGING GEARS FOR A SECOND,

24:03.041 --> 24:04.166
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO MY FRIEND JACK.

24:04.166 --> 24:05.792
JACK, THIS IS EMMA.

24:05.792 --> 24:07.125
HMM?

24:07.125 --> 24:08.125
SAY HI, JACK.

24:08.125 --> 24:09.375
OH. HI.

24:09.708 --> 24:11.000
JACK'S GAY.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.333
HE DOESN'T LOOK VERY GAY.

24:12.333 --> 24:13.625
JACK?
HMM?

24:13.625 --> 24:14.875
YOU? GAY.
OH, YEAH.

24:14.875 --> 24:16.041
SEE?

24:16.041 --> 24:17.083
WELL, GOOD FOR JACK, THEN.

24:17.083 --> 24:18.333
SO, ARE WE ANY CLOSER
TO GETTING THE APARTMENT?

24:18.333 --> 24:19.417
NO.

24:19.417 --> 24:21.041
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

24:35.125 --> 24:37.083
HEY!
AHH!

24:47.208 --> 24:49.458
THIS IS SO UNFAIR.
WHEN ARE THEY GONNA
PLAY MY SONG?

24:49.458 --> 24:50.959
WELL, MAYBE THE JUKEBOX
REJECTED IT

24:50.959 --> 24:54.000
ON THE GROUNDS THERE'S
BEEN PLENTY ENOUGH WHINY
CHICK-ROCK FOR ONE NIGHT,

24:54.000 --> 24:56.125
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

24:56.125 --> 24:56.875
BITE ME.

24:56.875 --> 24:59.417
ROWR.

24:59.417 --> 25:01.917
PACEY. GROSS.

25:01.917 --> 25:05.500
SO. NOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF?

25:05.500 --> 25:06.542
WHY WOULD I WANT
TO DO THAT, EXACTLY?

25:06.542 --> 25:09.291
EARLIER TODAY.
A CERTAIN FRANTIC DESIRE

25:09.291 --> 25:11.208
NOT TO BE CONFINED
TO A CERTAIN DORM ROOM

25:11.208 --> 25:13.125
WITH A CERTAIN BOSOMY BLONDE
WITH WHOM YOU SPENT
THE ENTIRE SUMMER.

25:13.125 --> 25:14.959
OH, THAT.
YES, THAT.

25:14.959 --> 25:17.000
(SNAP, CLAP)

25:19.500 --> 25:20.250
DO YOU REMEMBER
OUR PARTICULAR
SUMMER TOGETHER?

25:20.250 --> 25:22.667
RINGS A BELL
OR 2.
OK, GOOD.

25:22.667 --> 25:23.250
YOU REMEMBER HOW
WHEN WE CAME BACK

25:23.250 --> 25:25.500
WE WERE ALL
LOVEY-DOVEY

25:25.500 --> 25:27.333
AND WE DIDN'T REALLY
WANT THE SUMMER TO END,
AS SUCH?

25:27.333 --> 25:29.834
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF,
BUT...

25:29.834 --> 25:32.834
I DO RECALL
SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT.

25:36.250 --> 25:37.333
LET'S SAY
FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT

25:37.333 --> 25:40.750
THAT I AM NOT AT ALL UNHAPPY
THAT THIS SUMMER IS ENDING.

25:40.750 --> 25:42.166
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT
I DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD TIME,

25:42.166 --> 25:44.250
BECAUSE I DID, ABSOLUTELY.

25:44.250 --> 25:45.542
IT'S JUST THAT
A DIFFERENT HOLLYWOOD PARTY

25:45.542 --> 25:47.375
WITH DIFFERENT HOLLYWOOD
FRIENDS EVERY NIGHT

25:47.375 --> 25:49.917
AND "HOLLYWOOD AUDREY"
IS A LITTLE...

25:49.917 --> 25:50.333
EXHAUSTING.

25:50.333 --> 25:53.834
IN A WORD, YES.

25:53.834 --> 25:58.125
LOOK, I'VE GOT A CONFLICT HERE,
BECAUSE...

25:58.125 --> 26:03.208
SEE, THE PART OF ME THAT HAPPENS
TO BE YOUR CLOSE FRIEND
AND ERSTWHILE PARAMOUR

26:03.208 --> 26:07.500
SAYS, HEY, LIFE'S TOO SHORT.
YOU GOTTA DO WHAT MAKES
YOU HAPPY, RIGHT?

26:07.500 --> 26:08.875
BUT THEN THE OTHER PART OF ME,

26:08.875 --> 26:11.750
THE PART THAT HAPPENS TO BE
AUDREY'S CLOSE FRIEND
AND COLLEGE ROOMMATE

26:11.750 --> 26:14.083
SAYS, YOU KNOW WHAT?

26:14.083 --> 26:17.041
YOU BREAK HER HEART,
I BREAK YOUR FACE.

26:17.041 --> 26:18.333
GOT IT?

26:19.875 --> 26:20.166
I GOT IT.

26:20.166 --> 26:22.083
COME ON.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.708
SO, WHERE IS HE?

26:26.708 --> 26:28.708
"GODOT" LEERY,
YOU MEAN?

26:28.708 --> 26:31.291
I DON'T KNOW. THIS IS WHAT
IT WAS LIKE ALL SUMMER LONG.

26:31.291 --> 26:32.250
HE WAS OUT THE DOOR
BEFORE WE GOT UP

26:32.250 --> 26:33.583
AND HE WAS NEVER HOME
ANY EARLIER THAN MIDNIGHT.

26:33.583 --> 26:36.083
TODD KEPT HIM REALLY BUSY,
I GUESS.

26:36.083 --> 26:37.083
WHO'S TODD?

26:37.083 --> 26:38.417
DO YOU REMEMBER

26:38.417 --> 26:39.750
THE DIRECTOR THAT FIRED HIM
LAST SUMMER?

26:39.750 --> 26:44.250
WELL, HE HIRED HIM AS
HIS ASSISTANT THIS SUMMER.

26:44.250 --> 26:45.250
THAT'S HOLLYWOOD FOR YOU.

26:45.250 --> 26:46.583
WHAT ABOUT OLIVER?

26:46.583 --> 26:48.250
(AUDREY LAUGHS)

26:48.250 --> 26:49.542
HE FLIPPED OUT,
HATED L.A.,

26:49.542 --> 26:53.250
KEPT SAYING THAT HE COULD
LITERALLY SEE HIS SOUL
LEAVING HIS BODY.

26:53.250 --> 26:55.417
HE LEFT THIS NOTE
ON DAWSON'S PILLOW

26:55.417 --> 26:56.500
THAT SAID, "I'LL SEE YOU
IN HELL, LEERY."

26:56.500 --> 26:58.333
DRAMATIC TO THE END,
THAT ONE.

26:58.333 --> 27:00.583
DIDN'T YOU TALK TO HIM
AT ALL?

27:00.583 --> 27:02.208
OLIVER?
DAWSON.

27:02.208 --> 27:05.250
OH. UM...

27:05.250 --> 27:06.500
NO.

27:06.500 --> 27:10.834
I KEPT MEANING
TO CALL, BUT...

27:10.834 --> 27:11.750
INTERESTING.

27:11.750 --> 27:13.208
I'M GONNA GO
CHECK ON MY SONG.

27:15.083 --> 27:15.959
I'M TELLING YOU,
THIS THING
ATE MY DOLLAR.

27:15.959 --> 27:17.875
WELL, IT'S A JUKEBOX,
NOT A VENDING MACHINE.

27:17.875 --> 27:20.875
YOU WERE EXPECTING IT
TO SPIT OUT A CANDY BAR,
WERE YOU?

27:20.875 --> 27:21.959
ARE YOU GETTING SMART
WITH ME?

27:21.959 --> 27:22.792
I'M AFRAID
THAT'S UNAVOIDABLE.

27:24.250 --> 27:24.917
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT?

27:24.917 --> 27:26.417
A DRUNK GUY
WITH HIS FLY OPEN.

27:26.417 --> 27:27.625
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?

27:27.625 --> 27:28.792
(LAUGHS)

27:30.208 --> 27:31.458
THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD.

27:31.458 --> 27:34.000
IT WAS NOTHING.
YOU WERE DOING
PRETTY WELL YOURSELF.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.291
YEAH, WORKING
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS
DEFINITELY SHARPENS YOUR TONGUE.

27:36.291 --> 27:37.458
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

27:37.458 --> 27:38.250
I SPENT
MY HIGH SCHOOL YEARS

27:38.250 --> 27:39.834
WAITING TABLES AT
A PLACE LIKE THIS.

27:39.834 --> 27:41.792
TURNED ME INTO
A SURLY WENCH.

27:41.792 --> 27:43.959
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO BE
LOOKING FOR A JOB, WOULD YOU?

27:43.959 --> 27:46.500
'CAUSE WE COULD DEFINITELY USE
A SURLY WENCH WHO CAN
HANDLE HERSELF.

27:46.500 --> 27:47.375
UM...

27:47.375 --> 27:49.250
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

27:49.250 --> 27:50.959
UM, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

27:50.959 --> 27:52.500
I'M JOEY. JOEY POTTER.

27:52.500 --> 27:55.667
I'M EMMA JONES.
WELL, THINK ABOUT IT, JOEY.

27:55.667 --> 27:56.750
I WILL.

27:56.750 --> 27:58.125
AND I KNOW THE JUKEBOX
IS ALL BACKED UP.

27:58.125 --> 28:00.041
I'M STILL WAITING TO HEAR
"WHITE WEDDING," MYSELF.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.250
ALL RIGHT,
WELL, LOOK, IT'S BEEN
A BARREL OF MONKEYS,

28:07.250 --> 28:08.000
BUT I'M GOING HOME.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
WHAT?!

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
YOU AMATEUR!

28:12.000 --> 28:13.708
I GOTTA GET SOME REST,
SWEETHEART.

28:13.708 --> 28:15.625
I DON'T KNOW, PACEY.
IF I WERE IN A HIRING POSITION,

28:15.625 --> 28:19.917
I'D WANNA SEE SOMEBODY COME IN
WITH SUITCASES UNDER THEIR EYES
AND REEKING OF BOOZE AND SEX.

28:19.917 --> 28:22.125
OK, WELL,
I WILL TAKE THAT
UNDER CONSIDERATION,

28:22.125 --> 28:23.166
BUT I'M STILL GONNA GO.

28:23.166 --> 28:25.333
I DON'T LIKE THIS NEW PACEY.

28:25.333 --> 28:28.667
NOT ONE BIT.
WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE PACEY OF YORE?

28:28.667 --> 28:30.583
THE PACEY OF YORE
IS EXHAUSTED.

28:30.583 --> 28:33.041
THE PACEY OF YORE
JUST DROVE 3,000
MILES IN 3 DAYS.

28:33.041 --> 28:36.291
AREN'T YOU TIRED?
AND DON'T YOU HAVE
CLASSES TOMORROW?

28:36.291 --> 28:39.333
WELL, YES. BUT I ALSO
HAVE MY PRIORITIES.

28:42.208 --> 28:44.542
OK, DEMANDA.

28:44.542 --> 28:45.417
I'M GOING HOME.

28:45.417 --> 28:47.458
BROTHERS, SISTERS.

28:58.041 --> 28:58.542
HEY, WITTER! WAIT UP.

28:58.542 --> 28:59.834
AW, COME ON, AUDREY.

28:59.834 --> 29:01.750
HOW MANY TIMES DO I
HAVE TO TELL YOU?

29:01.750 --> 29:03.125
I NEED SOME REST.

29:03.125 --> 29:05.250
PLEASE DON'T BE ANNOYED
WITH ME, PACEY.

29:05.250 --> 29:08.250
TRUST ME. IN, LIKE, 2 MINUTES
YOU'RE GONNA BE SORRY THAT
YOU WERE SO ANNOYED WITH ME

29:08.250 --> 29:10.125
AND YOU'RE GONNA FEEL
LIKE A JERK, AND I WANT
TO SAVE YOU THAT PAIN.

29:11.834 --> 29:13.000
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

29:15.000 --> 29:16.125
WHAT'S THAT?

29:16.125 --> 29:17.583
IT IS A KEY TO A ROOM

29:17.583 --> 29:21.917
IN THE MOST RIDICULOUSLY SWANKY
HOTEL IN ALL OF BOSTON.

29:21.917 --> 29:25.708
I THOUGHT THAT WE SHOULD SPEND
THE LAST NIGHT OF OUR SUMMER
VACATION TOGETHER IN STYLE.

29:25.708 --> 29:29.875
I MEAN, WITH ALL THE MOTEL 6s
AND WHATNOT,

29:29.875 --> 29:31.917
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE
A NICE CHANGE OF PACE, PACE.

29:31.917 --> 29:34.208
AND I PROMISE
I WILL LET YOU REST.

29:34.208 --> 29:37.166
NO SEXUAL MISCONDUCT.
NOTHING.

29:37.166 --> 29:40.000
JUST TOTAL HARDCORE
REM SLEEP.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.500
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I FEEL LIKE A JERK.

29:42.500 --> 29:46.792
SEE? I TOLD YOU
THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

29:46.792 --> 29:48.750
DID YOU, NOW?

29:48.750 --> 29:52.000
LOOK, I'M SORRY. I JUST--
I REALLY WANT TO MAKE
A GOOD IMPRESSION TOMORROW.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.291
YOUR FATHER WAS KIND ENOUGH
TO GO OUT ON A LIMB FOR ME,

29:55.291 --> 29:58.041
AND I DON'T WANT TO LET HIM
DOWN BECAUSE THAT WOULD KIND
OF BE LIKE LETTING YOU DOWN,

29:58.041 --> 29:58.417
AND THAT WOULD SUCK.

29:58.417 --> 30:01.708
PACEY...
YES.

30:01.708 --> 30:03.083
YOU'RE GETTING
ALL SERIOUS ON ME.

30:04.291 --> 30:05.333
COME ON.

30:05.333 --> 30:07.083
LET'S GO REST.

30:09.333 --> 30:13.166
I DON'T KNOW HOW STRICT
WE HAVE TO BE ABOUT THAT
WHOLE "REST" THING.

30:13.166 --> 30:14.625
SO I CAN EITHER WORK FOR
THIS CRANKY PROFESSOR

30:14.625 --> 30:17.208
AND ADVANCE
MY ACADEMIC CAREER

30:17.208 --> 30:18.750
OR I CAN WORK HERE,

30:18.750 --> 30:20.458
BE HIT ON
BY DRUNKEN LOUTS
AND MAKE EXCELLENT TIPS.

30:20.458 --> 30:22.875
WHAT'S A GIRL TO DO?

30:22.875 --> 30:23.417
I DON'T EVEN THINK
IT'S A CHOICE
FOR YOU, JO.

30:23.417 --> 30:25.291
YEAH, ME NEITHER.

30:25.291 --> 30:25.834
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

30:25.834 --> 30:26.959
COME ON, GIVEN A CHOICE,

30:26.959 --> 30:29.917
JOEY POTTER WILL ALWAYS
VENTURE DOWN THE SENSIBLE PATH,

30:29.917 --> 30:33.291
AND THE SENSIBLE PATH
IN THIS CASE WOULD BE TO WORK
FOR PROFESSOR CRANKYPANTS.

30:33.291 --> 30:34.333
NICELY PUT.
THANK YOU.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.000
I'M SHOCKED AND APPALLED.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.417
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK OF ME?

30:37.417 --> 30:39.000
JO, IT'S NOT
A BAD THING.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.542
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
IT'S WHO YOU ARE.

30:40.542 --> 30:41.792
AND WE LOVE YOU FOR IT.

30:41.792 --> 30:44.417
(YAWNS) ALL RIGHT.
I GOTTA GO HOME.

30:44.417 --> 30:48.166
OUR LADY OF CONTINUING EDUCATION
WANTS TO HIT THE BOOKSTORES
BRIGHT AND EARLY,

30:48.166 --> 30:51.208
SO I NEED TO GET
SOME BEAUTY REST.
YOU COMING, JACKERS?

30:51.208 --> 30:53.166
YOU TALKED ME INTO IT.
JO, YOU COMING?

30:53.166 --> 30:57.000
UM, NO, I THINK
I'M GONNA STICK AROUND HERE
A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

31:01.000 --> 31:01.959
WHAT?

31:01.959 --> 31:04.917
NOTHING. IT'S CUTE.

31:04.917 --> 31:06.917
(SIGHS) GO. GO ON.
GET OUT OF HERE.

31:49.875 --> 31:50.125
JOEY!

32:06.208 --> 32:07.417
Dawson: ALL RIGHT,
SO GUESS WHAT?

32:07.417 --> 32:08.959
WHAT?

32:08.959 --> 32:10.166
TAKE A GUESS.

32:10.166 --> 32:11.375
YOU'RE GAY.

32:11.375 --> 32:14.083
THAT AND...

32:14.083 --> 32:17.041
I WAS ON THE PHONE
WITH STEVEN SPIELBERG
THE OTHER DAY.

32:17.041 --> 32:17.750
REALLY?
SORT OF.

32:17.750 --> 32:19.667
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"SORT OF"?

32:19.667 --> 32:21.417
HE CALLED FOR TODD,

32:21.417 --> 32:24.375
AND I SAID, "HOLD ON
A SECOND, PLEASE,"

32:24.375 --> 32:25.417
AND I PUT TODD ON.

32:25.417 --> 32:26.750
THAT'S IT?

32:26.750 --> 32:28.291
MY HANDS WERE SHAKING.

32:28.291 --> 32:32.667
"HOLD ON A SECOND, PLEASE"?
THAT'S THE BEST YOU COULD DO
FOR YOUR CHILDHOOD HERO?

32:36.583 --> 32:38.667
I THOUGHT FOR SURE
I WAS GONNA MISS YOU
AGAIN.

32:38.667 --> 32:41.875
YOU ALMOST DID.
EVERYONE LEFT.
I WAS NEXT.

32:41.875 --> 32:44.834
BUT YOU COULDN'T
BRING YOURSELF TO LEAVE,
COULD YOU?

32:44.834 --> 32:47.333
YOU HAD TO SEE ME.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.792
GET OVER YOURSELF.
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW

32:49.792 --> 32:52.583
THAT I STUCK A DOLLAR
IN THAT JUKEBOX
OVER 3 HOURS AGO.

32:52.583 --> 32:54.750
I WAS NOT GONNA LEAVE
UNTIL I HEARD MY SONG.

32:54.750 --> 32:56.834
OK. ALL RIGHT.
MY MISTAKE.

32:56.834 --> 32:59.875
SO TELL ME ABOUT
THIS MOVIE YOU'RE MAKING.

32:59.875 --> 33:03.208
UM, IT'S A HORROR MOVIE...

33:03.208 --> 33:04.959
NO MATTER WHAT TODD SAYS.

33:04.959 --> 33:06.959
HE LIKES TO TELL PEOPLE
THAT IT'S A HITCHCOCKIAN
THRILLER,

33:06.959 --> 33:09.792
BUT THAT'S KIND OF LIKE
SAYING HAPPY GILMORE
IS AN HOMAGE TO WOODY ALLEN.

33:13.250 --> 33:15.458
YOU LOOK GREAT,
BY THE WAY.

33:15.458 --> 33:16.750
THANK YOU.

33:16.750 --> 33:18.000
I DON'T SAY THINGS
LIKE THAT NEARLY ENOUGH.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.792
THE SECOND I SAW YOU
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,
"GOD, SHE LOOKS GREAT,"

33:20.792 --> 33:24.083
BUT I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING, SO...

33:24.083 --> 33:25.125
I'M SAYING IT NOW.

33:25.125 --> 33:25.959
IS THIS SOME PLAYER ROUTINE

33:25.959 --> 33:29.000
YOU WORKSHOPPED IN L.A.
OVER THE SUMMER?

33:29.000 --> 33:31.875
CAN A GUY NOT TELL A GIRL
THAT SHE LOOKS GREAT

33:31.875 --> 33:33.959
WITHOUT THERE
BEING SOME SORT
OF MANIPULATION INVOLVED?

33:33.959 --> 33:36.500
GENERALLY, NO.

33:36.500 --> 33:38.125
OK, GOOD POINT.

33:38.125 --> 33:39.083
BUT THIS IS YOU AND ME.

33:39.083 --> 33:41.583
GENERAL RULES DO NOT
APPLY TO YOU AND ME.

33:41.583 --> 33:44.000
THEY NEVER HAVE.

33:45.750 --> 33:47.708
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

33:47.708 --> 33:48.667
OK.

33:48.667 --> 33:53.417
WE DIDN'T TALK THIS SUMMER.
AT ALL. WHY IS THAT?

33:53.417 --> 33:56.333
QUICK AND EASY ANSWER
WOULD BE THAT I WAS
REALLY, REALLY BUSY

33:56.333 --> 33:58.041
AND THERE
JUST WASN'T ANY TIME.

33:58.041 --> 34:01.667
WHICH IS TRUE, BUT...
IT'S NOT REALLY IT,

34:01.667 --> 34:04.542
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME,
AND ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID

34:04.542 --> 34:07.583
ABOUT HOW EVERYTHING
WOULD JUST KIND OF
WORK ITSELF OUT BETWEEN US

34:07.583 --> 34:10.000
AND IT JUST...

34:10.000 --> 34:12.542
MADE ME FEEL
SO GOOD ABOUT US.

34:12.542 --> 34:16.708
I JUST...WELL, I GUESS
I DIDN'T WANT TO RUIN
THAT FEELING.

34:16.708 --> 34:19.375
DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE?

34:19.375 --> 34:21.917
IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE,
ACTUALLY.

34:21.917 --> 34:25.792
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS.

34:25.792 --> 34:27.708
WHAT?

34:27.708 --> 34:28.625
DARE I SAY
WE MIGHT BE GROWING UP?

34:28.625 --> 34:31.542
OH, GOD.
WHAT?

34:31.542 --> 34:32.708
THAT SOUNDS
SO BORING.

34:32.708 --> 34:34.917
TRUE.
SAD BUT TRUE.

34:34.917 --> 34:38.417
BUT I MEAN...

34:38.417 --> 34:40.708
CASE IN POINT.

34:40.708 --> 34:42.500
YOU SEEM...DIFFERENT.

34:42.500 --> 34:44.667
DIFFERENT HOW?

34:44.667 --> 34:47.375
JUST DIFFERENT.
A GOOD DIFFERENT...

34:48.958 --> 34:52.000
LIKE LIVING YOUR DREAM
AGREES WITH YOU.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.917
I DON'T KNOW
THAT FETCHING LATTES

34:54.917 --> 34:56.333
AND HAVING TODD'S
PORSCHE DETAILED

34:56.333 --> 34:56.833
QUALIFIES AS
LIVING THE DREAM, BUT...

34:56.833 --> 34:58.834
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

35:02.083 --> 35:03.917
YEAH, I DO.

35:07.750 --> 35:09.625
SO WHAT ABOUT YOU?

35:09.625 --> 35:10.458
WHAT ABOUT ME?

35:10.458 --> 35:12.917
DID YOU DO ANYTHING
SPECIAL THIS SUMMER?

35:12.917 --> 35:13.917
DID YOU MEET
ANYONE SPECIAL?

35:13.917 --> 35:16.750
MMM, NO ONE
WORTH MENTIONING.

35:16.750 --> 35:19.417
AND YOU?

35:19.417 --> 35:22.000
AH! FINALLY!

35:22.000 --> 35:23.667
I KNOW THIS SONG.
THIS IS A GREAT SONG.

35:23.667 --> 35:26.041
YEAH, IT IS.

35:29.959 --> 35:31.583
WHAT?
NOTHING.

35:31.583 --> 35:34.750
IT JUST REMINDS ME
OF SOMETHING.

35:34.750 --> 35:37.792
THE SUMMER BETWEEN
SEVENTH AND EIGHTH GRADE,

35:37.792 --> 35:38.625
AND CLUELESS.

35:38.625 --> 35:39.959
WAS IT ON THE SOUNDTRACK
OR SOMETHING?

35:39.959 --> 35:41.458
NO. AT LEAST,
I DON'T THINK SO.

35:41.458 --> 35:44.333
UM...

35:44.333 --> 35:46.041
WE WENT TO SEE IT
AT THE RIALTO, REMEMBER?

35:46.041 --> 35:50.250
AND WHEN WE GOT OUT
IT WAS POURING RAIN,

35:50.250 --> 35:53.917
YOUR MOM CAME TO PICK US UP,
BUT THE CAR WAS, LIKE,
WAY ACROSS THE STREET

35:53.917 --> 35:56.834
SO YOU GRABBED MY HAND
AND WE RAN FOR IT.

35:56.834 --> 36:00.625
AND IT WAS PROBABLY ONLY
ABOUT 10 SECONDS OR SO,

36:00.625 --> 36:03.417
BUT WHEN WE GOT IN THE CAR,

36:03.417 --> 36:06.708
ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT
WAS THE FACT THAT...

36:06.708 --> 36:08.667
YOU HAD HELD MY HAND.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.667
SO WHAT DOES IT
HAVE TO DO WITH THE SONG?

36:15.667 --> 36:18.375
IT WAS PLAYING ON THE RADIO
IN YOUR MOM'S CAR.

36:18.375 --> 36:19.583
OH.

36:23.834 --> 36:25.000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36:25.000 --> 36:27.250
I WAS GONNA ASK YOU
TO DANCE.

36:27.250 --> 36:30.166
ARE YOU CRAZY?

36:30.166 --> 36:33.208
YEAH, BUT THE OFFER
STILL STANDS.

37:27.083 --> 37:29.917
THANK YOU
FOR WALKING ME HOME.

37:29.917 --> 37:32.166
NO THANKS NECESSARY.
IT'S WHAT I DO.

37:33.208 --> 37:35.583
ALL RIGHT,
I SHOULD PROBABLY GO.

37:35.583 --> 37:36.750
YOU DON'T HAVE TO, YOU KNOW.

37:36.750 --> 37:38.083
I DON'T?

37:38.083 --> 37:39.917
AUDREY'S WITH PACEY TONIGHT.

37:39.917 --> 37:42.083
OH, COOL.

37:42.083 --> 37:43.333
SO YOU CAN TAKE HER BED
IF YOU WANT.

37:43.333 --> 37:45.625
I COULD VERY EASILY GET
A CAB BACK TO THE HOTEL.

37:45.625 --> 37:49.542
OF COURSE NOT. I DON'T WANT
YOU WALKING AROUND OUT THERE
THIS LATE.

37:52.041 --> 37:52.959
THANKS.

37:52.959 --> 37:56.583
NO THANKS NECESSARY.

37:56.583 --> 37:58.000
IT'S WHAT I  DO.

38:43.458 --> 38:44.708
JO, YOU AWAKE?

38:44.708 --> 38:46.708
YEAH.

38:46.708 --> 38:47.500
I'M SORRY.
I FELL ASLEEP.

38:47.500 --> 38:49.708
YOU MUST BE EXHAUSTED.
GET SOME SLEEP.

38:49.708 --> 38:50.125
WE CAN TALK
IN THE MORNING.

38:50.125 --> 38:52.792
WHAT TIME IS IT?

38:52.792 --> 38:53.875
5 OF 12:00.

38:53.875 --> 38:54.500
DAMN.

38:57.000 --> 38:57.458
WHAT'S WRONG?

39:00.041 --> 39:02.834
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

39:02.834 --> 39:05.333
CHEATING.
I CAN'T WAIT ANYMORE.

39:12.375 --> 39:14.291
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JO.

39:18.500 --> 39:20.000
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO REMEMBERED.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.375
YEAH, I'M GOOD LIKE THAT.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.166
THANK YOU, DAWSON.

39:34.166 --> 39:35.500
IT'S CHEESY. I KNOW.

39:35.500 --> 39:37.583
NO, IT'S NOT CHEESY
AT ALL. IT'S PERFECT.

39:45.375 --> 39:46.959
YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE SAYING BEFORE,

39:46.959 --> 39:50.500
ABOUT HOW LIVING MY DREAM
AGREES WITH ME?

39:50.500 --> 39:53.875
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THAT
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW

39:53.875 --> 39:57.500
THAT I PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE
LIVING ANY DREAM AT ALL
IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU.

39:57.500 --> 40:00.875
I MEAN, MORE AND MORE
I KEEP ON FINDING MYSELF

40:00.875 --> 40:05.166
IN THESE INCREDIBLY
SURREAL SITUATIONS

40:05.166 --> 40:08.125
AND EVERY TIME...

40:08.125 --> 40:09.625
I ALWAYS KIND OF, IN THE BACK
OF MY HEAD JUST THINK,

40:09.625 --> 40:14.583
"WHAT WOULD JOEY THINK
IF SHE COULD SEE ME RIGHT NOW?"

40:14.583 --> 40:19.667
YOU KNOW, I GUESS EVERYONE HAS
SOMEONE WHO CHALLENGES THEM.

40:19.667 --> 40:25.458
AND MAKES THEM
SHOOT FOR SOMETHING
JUST BEYOND THEIR REACH.

40:28.917 --> 40:29.834
YOU'RE THAT PERSON FOR ME.

40:29.834 --> 40:34.750
SO, YEAH, MAYBE WE DIDN'T
TALK THIS SUMMER,

40:34.750 --> 40:38.834
AND WHO KNOWS,
MAYBE WE'LL FIND OURSELVES
TALKING LESS AND LESS

40:38.834 --> 40:42.583
AS TIME GOES ON AND LIFE
GETS MORE AND MORE IN THE WAY,

40:42.583 --> 40:44.250
BUT...

40:44.250 --> 40:47.583
I GOTTA SAY, JO,
I DON'T FEEL IT.

40:50.250 --> 40:51.583
'CAUSE YOU'RE WITH ME
EVERYWHERE I GO.
