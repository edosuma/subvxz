17:53.906 --> 17:56.450
They get you excited,

17:56.533 --> 17:59.203
Remember, they're not real.

I completely regret

19:23.412 --> 19:26.123
you've been a huge asshole
to me recently?

19:30.335 --> 19:31.461
- Fine.

19:31.545 --> 19:34.882
In that case,
tonight, we drink.

Tomorrow, we talk.

19:43.348 --> 19:46.977
- Sinclair,
come take a look at this.

19:47.060 --> 19:49.771
De-incrypted comms say
there's a Sky Chariot

19:49.855 --> 19:53.775
making a detour nearby,
caught in the blizzard.

Take her to somewhere

No war.

I hear New Zealand
still has trees.

Polity and Union will

They'll get a lot more

21:32.916 --> 21:35.377

to the Anvil, Dr. Jha.

21:35.460 --> 21:36.753
- Tate.

21:36.837 --> 21:39.756
Here to show me to my cell,
or the gallows?

21:39.840 --> 21:41.174

You're free to go after my--

what would Polity folk call it?

21:46.847 --> 21:49.599
Ah, yes.
Sales pitch.

21:53.979 --> 21:57.774
As scientists, you and I
rely on evidence, yes?

21:57.858 --> 22:00.736
I was pulled apart
on a subatomic level,

22:00.819 --> 22:02.988
yet here I stand before you.

22:03.071 --> 22:07.242
I am, quite literally,
The Miracle Incarnate.

22:08.660 --> 22:11.121
Come on.
Try harder.

22:11.204 --> 22:13.582
- What happened to me
happened to others.

22:13.665 --> 22:16.168
You needn't take my word.

22:22.674 --> 22:23.967
Comfy?

22:24.051 --> 22:25.677
- Tell me, Tate.

22:25.761 --> 22:28.680
When the Smoke
ripped you apart,

22:28.764 --> 22:32.100
how did it feel?

22:32.184 --> 22:37.773
- The Flow pulled me
into a home I never knew I had.

22:37.856 --> 22:41.443
I remember every moment
of my time in the Hereafter

22:41.526 --> 22:47.115
with a crystalline clarity
only pure joy can carve.

22:47.199 --> 22:50.243
Upon my return
to the material plane,

22:50.327 --> 22:52.621
I was heartbroken,

22:52.704 --> 22:58.418
until I realized the universe
had shown me my purpose.

22:58.502 --> 23:00.295
- To save humanity

23:00.378 --> 23:04.591
by convincing it
to commit group suicide?

23:04.674 --> 23:09.554
- The Flow is everlasting life.
It is real.

23:09.638 --> 23:12.015
I was blessed to experience it,

23:12.099 --> 23:15.268
then returned to ensure
as many as possible

23:15.352 --> 23:17.479
have access to everlasting life

23:17.562 --> 23:23.318
with what little time I have
before the Earth burns.

23:23.401 --> 23:25.654
I know
I've wielded great cruelty

23:25.737 --> 23:28.949
in service of this task.

23:29.032 --> 23:33.328
Every murder, every deceit
is a thorn in my crown,

23:33.411 --> 23:35.163
digging into my skin.

23:35.247 --> 23:40.085
But I do these things
in service of humanity--

23:40.168 --> 23:42.671
of hope, not profit,

23:42.754 --> 23:46.925
not like
Holcroft's Martian lie.

23:47.008 --> 23:49.511
- What do you mean, lie?

23:49.594 --> 23:53.682
- Allow me
to show you the light.

23:53.765 --> 23:56.059
<i>- In all my time
selling pretty lies,</i>

23:56.143 --> 23:57.686
<i>I never thought I'd sell one</i>

23:57.769 --> 24:00.230
<i>as grandiose
as your Martian mirage.</i>

24:00.313 --> 24:02.274
<i>Selling a fictional city
on Mars</i>

24:02.357 --> 24:04.359
<i>to half the human population?</i>

24:07.362 --> 24:09.990
- Even if your UnLock succeeds,

24:10.073 --> 24:15.203
Holcroft won't save anyone
who can't pay.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.788
I ask you, please.

24:16.872 --> 24:20.876
Work with my people
on our Twilight initiative.

24:20.959 --> 24:24.296
Help us defy extinction.
