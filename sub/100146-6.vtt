WEBVTT

00:00.792 --> 00:02.336
PREVIOUSLY ON "ALL AMERICAN"...

00:02.336 --> 00:04.046
LAYLA: YOU WANT TO
HAVE ME COMMITTED?

00:04.046 --> 00:05.297
YOUR MOM. SHE SUFFERED
FROM DEPRESSION.

00:05.297 --> 00:07.341
DEPRESSION CAN BE
HEREDITARY, SWEETIE.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.634
BILLY: YOU WANT TO RUN
BEVERLY FOOTBALL

00:08.634 --> 00:10.802
LIKE A DIVISION I
COLLEGE PROGRAM.

00:10.802 --> 00:12.346
AND YOU'RE NOT
OFFERING ME ANY MONEY?

00:12.346 --> 00:14.473
SOUNDS LIKE YOU WANT
ME TO BE YOUR SLAVE.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.475
-BEEN A YEAR, MOM.
-WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

00:16.475 --> 00:20.312
I'M HOPING THAT YOU'LL
SERVE YOUR FATHER
DIVORCE PAPERS.

00:20.312 --> 00:21.772
BILLY:
WHAT ARE THESE?

00:21.772 --> 00:23.482
LETTERS TO MY BOYS
SAYING GOOD-BYE.

00:23.482 --> 00:25.275
DARNELL: YOU MUST'VE DID
SOMETHING TO RUN HIM OFF.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.277
YOU COULDN'T STAND THE FACT
THAT I'M MORE OF A SON

00:27.277 --> 00:28.737
TO HIM THAN YOU
WILL EVER BE.

00:28.737 --> 00:30.489
SPENCE,
CHILL, MAN!

00:30.489 --> 00:32.699
I REMEMBER ALL THIS
FROM WHEN COREY LEFT
THE FIRST TIME.

00:32.699 --> 00:36.245
I SPENT YEARS ASKING
MYSELF WHAT I DID
TO MAKE HIM LEAVE,

00:36.245 --> 00:37.704
HOW COULD I BRING
HIM BACK.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.581
I'M NOT
DOING THAT AGAIN!

00:39.581 --> 00:41.708
YOU ARE NOT MOVING
BACK INTO THE HOUSE.
I'VE GOT IT HANDLED.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.710
JORDAN HAS GOT
A GIRL PREGNANT.

00:45.910 --> 00:47.740
ROCHELLE: SET?

00:47.740 --> 00:49.620
LITTLE TIGHTER,
LITTLE TIGHTER.
REMEMBER...

00:49.620 --> 00:51.290
JORDAN: THIS GONNA BE...?
ROCHELLE: THIS IS TO CREATE...

00:51.290 --> 00:52.870
BUZZ AND EXCITEMENT.
JORDAN, YOU READY?

00:52.870 --> 00:55.920
READY. SO YEAH.
UH, TO CAMERA? TO YOU?
TO YOU. GOT IT.

00:55.920 --> 00:57.380
ROCHELLE: SO,
JORDAN BAKER,

00:57.380 --> 00:59.500
BEVERLY FOOTBALL
STAR QUARTERBACK,

00:59.500 --> 01:01.090
WHAT DOES FOOTBALL
MEAN TO YOU?

01:01.090 --> 01:03.760
UH, GIRLS. FOOTBALL IS
ALL ABOUT THE GIRLS.

01:03.760 --> 01:06.890
WOULD YOU GET OUT
OF HERE, OK?

01:06.890 --> 01:11.430
J.J.'s ALL RIGHT.
UM, LEADERSHIP.

01:11.430 --> 01:13.020
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE 3 Rs.

01:13.020 --> 01:16.060
YOU KNOW, RESPONSIBILITY,
RESPECT,

01:16.060 --> 01:18.900
AND, UM, ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:18.900 --> 01:22.860
I KNOW--I KNOW THAT'S
ONLY 2 Rs, BUT YOU
CAN EDIT THIS, RIGHT?

01:22.860 --> 01:24.950
ROCHELLE:
TELL US, SPENCER,
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE

01:24.950 --> 01:28.530
TO PLAY FOR BEVERLY
INSTEAD OF STAYING
IN SOUTH CRENSHAW?

01:28.530 --> 01:30.950
I CAME TO BEVERLY TO PLAY
CHAMPIONSHIP FOOTBALL.

01:30.950 --> 01:33.660
WELL, CLEARLY,
YOU MADE
THE RIGHT DECISION.

01:33.660 --> 01:35.750
STATE CHAMPS.
GO, EAGLES.

01:35.750 --> 01:38.710
SO WHAT DOES FOOTBALL
MEAN TO YOU?

01:38.710 --> 01:41.460
FOOTBALL MEANS
A LOT OF THINGS TO ME.

01:41.460 --> 01:43.470
BUT I GUESS IT'S
THE LESSONS IT TAUGHT ME

01:43.470 --> 01:45.930
ABOUT FACING ADVERSITY
THAT MADE ME WHO I AM,

01:45.930 --> 01:47.640
SO IT'S THOSE LESSONS
THAT MEAN THE MOST.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.550
CARE TO SHARE SOME
OF THOSE LESSONS?

01:49.550 --> 01:53.810
WHEN I WAS A KID, I WAS
TAUGHT TO TACKLE MY PROBLEMS,

01:53.810 --> 01:59.060
BLOCK OUT MY FEARS,
AND ALWAYS FINISH STRONG
NO MATTER WHAT.

01:59.060 --> 02:00.980
THAT'S HOW I TRY
TO LIVE MY LIFE.

02:00.980 --> 02:02.650
WHO TAUGHT
YOU THAT?

02:02.650 --> 02:04.690
SPENCER?

02:14.030 --> 02:17.200
NOW, NOW, WHO DOESN'T
LOVE A REMATCH? AM I RIGHT?

02:17.200 --> 02:18.320
-YEAH!
-YEAH!

02:18.320 --> 02:20.120
BOY: WHOO!

02:20.120 --> 02:21.870
CLIFF: I KNOW YOU'VE
HEARD THE WHISPERS,

02:21.870 --> 02:24.750
AND NOW I CAN CONFIRM
THE RUMORS ARE TRUE.

02:24.750 --> 02:27.130
COACH BAKER HAS AGREED
TO HOST

02:27.130 --> 02:31.800
OUR SOUTH CRENSHAW RIVALS
IN A FRIENDLY 7-ON-7 REMATCH

02:31.800 --> 02:34.880
OF LAST YEAR'S
STATE CHAMPIONSHIP.

02:34.880 --> 02:38.140
THAT'S RIGHT. THE BEVERLY WAY
WILL BE ON FULL DISPLAY

02:38.140 --> 02:41.810
THIS WEEKEND IN OUR HOUSE.

02:44.680 --> 02:47.100
SPENCER: I'M SURPRISED
YOU'RE COOL WITH ALL THIS.

02:47.100 --> 02:50.940
NOT MY IDEA. THIS REMATCH
IS A LOSE/LOSE GAME FOR US,

02:50.940 --> 02:53.860
BUT I WAS OUTVOTED BY
ATHLETIC DIRECTOR HART.

02:53.860 --> 02:55.240
CLIFF:
IT'S AN EXHIBITION GAME,

02:55.240 --> 02:56.740
SO WE SET IT UP TO FEEL

02:56.740 --> 02:58.240
A LITTLE MORE LIKE
THE REAL THING.

02:58.240 --> 02:59.990
SO BE PREPARED.

02:59.990 --> 03:02.120
THIS ONE HERE IS GOING TO BE
EXCITING TO WATCH.

03:02.120 --> 03:04.910
SO TELL YOUR FRIENDS,
HAVE THEM TELL SOME FRIENDS,

03:04.910 --> 03:07.750
AND THEN TELL SOME MORE FRIENDS.
HA HA!

03:07.750 --> 03:09.670
THAT'S ENOUGH.
CLIFF, A WORD?

03:09.670 --> 03:12.670
ALL RIGHT. ENJOY
YOURSELVES. HERE WE GO.

03:14.210 --> 03:15.920
ARE YOU GOOD?

03:15.920 --> 03:18.800
YEAH. UM, JUST COVER
FOR ME, WOULD YOU?

03:18.800 --> 03:20.600
YEAH.

03:23.010 --> 03:26.100
HEY, MY LOCKER ROOM IS
A SIDESHOW UP IN THERE.

03:26.100 --> 03:28.390
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF
SHOWMANSHIP,

03:28.390 --> 03:30.900
SOMETHING WE BOTH KNOW
YOU DON'T POSSESS.

03:30.900 --> 03:33.650
SO WHY DON'T
YOU DO YOUR JOB
AND LET ME DO MINE?

03:33.650 --> 03:36.950
OH, I DID MY JOB. I WON
THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.950
TELL ME, CLIFF,
WHAT IS YOUR JOB?

03:38.950 --> 03:40.280
-MY JOB?
-MM-HMM.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.370
-I CREATE BUZZ.
-BUZZ?

03:42.370 --> 03:44.290
-EXCITEMENT.
-MAN!

03:44.290 --> 03:46.000
LOOK, THAT STATE
CHAMPIONSHIP IS ALREADY
YESTERDAY'S NEWS.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.750
I'M TRYING TO BUILD
SOMETHING,

03:48.750 --> 03:50.000
A LEGACY THAT WILL
OUTLIVE BOTH OF US.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.960
WE'RE ON THE SAME
SIDE, BILLY.

03:51.960 --> 03:53.880
ARE WE?

03:53.880 --> 03:56.260
THIS REMATCH OF YOURS,
IT'S A BAD IDEA.

03:56.260 --> 03:57.420
WE HAVE ZERO INCENTIVE
TO PLAY.

03:57.420 --> 03:58.840
WE BEAT 'EM ALREADY.

03:58.840 --> 04:01.760
NOW, IF WE LOSE,
WE TARNISH OUR TITLE.

04:01.760 --> 04:04.220
THEN DON'T LOSE.

04:11.060 --> 04:14.820
HEY. SORRY. I DIDN'T
MEAN TO FREAK YOU OUT.

04:14.820 --> 04:18.440
NO, NO. IT'S,
UM, ALL GOOD. YOU OK?

04:18.440 --> 04:21.740
SO MY DOCTOR WAS ABLE
TO SQUEEZE ME IN

04:21.740 --> 04:23.780
FOR AN ULTRASOUND
THIS WEEKEND.

04:23.780 --> 04:25.700
THAT'S GREAT.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.830
IT'S JUST MY PARENTS
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE BABY,

04:27.830 --> 04:31.920
SO I CAN'T, LIKE, ASK
MY MOM TO COME WITH.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.000
SO...

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
SO YOU WANT ME TO--
YEAH. OK.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.920
YEAH. UM, YEAH. I--
CAN BE THERE.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.210
UM, WHEN--WHEN IS IT?

04:38.210 --> 04:39.840
SATURDAY AT 3 P.M.

04:39.840 --> 04:43.470
SATURDAY. OK.
SATURDAY?

04:43.470 --> 04:45.430
OK. SATURDAY.

04:45.430 --> 04:50.060
WELL, UM, I'LL JUST
TEXT YOU THE INFO. UM...

05:09.370 --> 05:11.790
DON'T YOU USUALLY
PAY SOMEONE TO DO
THIS PART FOR YOU?

05:11.790 --> 05:13.080
I'M NOT GONNA PAY
A STRANGER

05:13.080 --> 05:15.080
TO GO THROUGH ALL
MY PERSONAL STUFF.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.460
INTERESTING.

05:16.460 --> 05:18.050
ISN'T THAT EXACTLY WHAT
YOU'RE DOING WITH ME,

05:18.050 --> 05:21.050
PAYING A STRANGER TO GO
THROUGH MY PERSONAL STUFF?

05:21.050 --> 05:23.220
HONEY, THIS AIN'T
THE SAME AS THERAPY.

05:23.220 --> 05:25.010
WHAT'S DIFFERENT?

05:25.010 --> 05:27.010
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
WASTING YOUR TIME,

05:27.010 --> 05:29.560

I DID TODAY IN THERAPY.

05:29.560 --> 05:32.020
SWEETHEART,

05:32.020 --> 05:33.980

PRETTY GREAT, HUH?

05:44.910 --> 05:47.910
UM, IT'S JUST
ANOTHER HOUSE, DAD.

05:47.910 --> 05:51.410
WHAT IF IT WAS MORE THAN
JUST A HOUSE, LAYLA?

05:51.410 --> 05:53.830
WHAT IF THIS ONE,

05:53.830 --> 05:57.420
WE BOTH WORK REALLY
HARD TO MAKE IT A HOME

05:57.420 --> 05:59.420
TOGETHER?

05:59.420 --> 06:02.220
I'M PRETTY TIRED.

06:02.220 --> 06:05.010

SIMONE.

06:24.570 --> 06:27.320
OH, GOOD. I WAS HOPING
IT WAS THE MOTHER
OF YOUR UNBORN CHILD

06:27.320 --> 06:28.950
THAT YOU WERE IGNORING.

06:28.950 --> 06:30.540
LOOK, HER ULTRASOUND
IS AT THE SAME TIME

06:30.540 --> 06:32.410
AS THE SOUTH CRENSHAW
REMATCH, OK?

06:32.410 --> 06:35.160
I CAN'T GO. I DON'T
WANT HER TO FEEL LIKE
I'M BAILING.

06:35.160 --> 06:39.790
RIGHT. SO GHOSTING HER FELT
LIKE THE BETTER SOLUTION.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.300
NOT COOL, OLIVIA.

06:50.300 --> 06:51.930
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

06:51.930 --> 06:55.230
HMM. SINCE WHEN DO
YOU IGNORE ASHER?

06:55.230 --> 06:57.940
SINCE WE SORT OF...

06:57.940 --> 07:00.610
OK. YEAH. DON'T NEED
TO HEAR DETAILS,
THANK YOU.

07:00.610 --> 07:04.150
UH, NO. WE JUST KISSED,
AND WE WERE FULLY SOBER.

07:04.150 --> 07:09.410
I DON'T KNOW. I--
I REALLY DO LIKE HIM.

07:09.410 --> 07:10.990
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

07:10.990 --> 07:13.870
I GUESS I'M JUST HESITANT
TO GO THERE WITH HIM.

07:13.870 --> 07:15.540
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

07:15.540 --> 07:18.210
ONLY, LIV, UH,
THE LAST TIME YOU
GUYS GOT TOGETHER,

07:18.210 --> 07:20.170
YOU WERE IN A BAD PLACE.

07:20.170 --> 07:23.130
MAYBE YOU JUST DON'T
WANT TO BE REMINDED
OF YOUR ADDICTION.

07:23.130 --> 07:26.170
YEAH. IT'S NOT EXACTLY
SOMETHING YOU FORGET.

07:26.170 --> 07:29.010
EVERY DAY, I MAKE
AN ACTIVE CHOICE
TO STAY SOBER.

07:29.010 --> 07:32.220
OK. BUT DO YOU NEED
YET ANOTHER REMINDER?

07:32.220 --> 07:33.390
REMINDER OF WHAT?

07:33.390 --> 07:35.980
-HI, MOM.
-HI, MOM.

A LOT OF TIME IN HERE LATELY.

08:18.390 --> 08:20.390
JUST WANTED TO
CHECK UP ON YOU,

08:20.390 --> 08:23.270
SEE WHERE YOUR HEAD'S AT
WITH SOUTH CRENSHAW ON
THE SCHEDULE THIS WEEK.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.150
I'M GOOD.

08:27.530 --> 08:31.070
YOU DON'T THINK PLAYING
CRENSHAW RIGHT AFTER
YOUR POPS LEFT

08:31.070 --> 08:34.030
MIGHT OPEN UP
SOME OLD WOUNDS?

08:37.580 --> 08:39.410
I APPRECIATE YOU,
COACH,

08:39.410 --> 08:42.040
BUT I MADE MY PEACE
WITH MY POPS LEAVING.
HONESTLY.

08:42.040 --> 08:43.540
HE DID WHAT HE DOES BEST.

08:43.540 --> 08:45.090
I'M TRYING TO DO
WHAT I DO BEST.

08:45.090 --> 08:47.090
AND YOU KNOW I'M WITH
YOU ON ALL THAT, BUT...

08:47.090 --> 08:48.670
YOU DON'T GOT TO PLAY

08:50.550 --> 08:52.300
I AIN'T WORRIED
ABOUT CLIFF.

08:52.300 --> 08:54.180
DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE
HIM, ALL RIGHT?

08:54.180 --> 08:56.510
I DON'T WANT YOU GETTING
CAUGHT UP IN HIS GAME.

08:56.510 --> 08:58.310
HE PUTS ON A REAL GOOD SHOW,

08:58.310 --> 09:01.140
BUT HE DOES NOT
CARE WHO HE HURTS
AS LONG AS HE LOOKS GOOD.

09:01.140 --> 09:04.230
I JUST WANT YOU TO STAY
TRUE TO WHO YOU ARE.

09:06.110 --> 09:09.110
LOOK, YOU AIN'T GOT TO
WORRY ABOUT ME, ALL RIGHT?

09:09.110 --> 09:10.740
AIN'T NOBODY FORGETTING

SHOTS OF ME

09:31.630 --> 09:33.630
TO BOOST PUBLICITY
FOR THE GAME AGAINST
SOUTH CRENSHAW.

09:33.630 --> 09:35.390
IT'S COOL.

09:35.390 --> 09:37.220
COULD WE LOSE THIS RUG?

09:37.220 --> 09:39.560
NO. SHE DID NOT
JUST DISRESPECT
YOUR GRANNY'S RUG.

09:39.560 --> 09:41.640
NOT ONLY IS YOUR MOM
GONNA FLIP. SHE GONNA
END YOU, TOO.

09:41.640 --> 09:42.770
ALL RIGHT, COOP.
COME ON. GET OUT.

09:42.770 --> 09:44.770
COOP: I'M JUST SAYIN'.

09:46.150 --> 09:47.730
LOOK, ARE YOU HERE
FOR A FAVOR,

09:47.730 --> 09:49.110
OR YOU JUST TRYING
TO STRESS ME OUT?

09:49.110 --> 09:50.570
A FAVOR.
THE STRESS IS ON YOU.

09:50.570 --> 09:53.150
BUT, YO, CAN YOU HOLLA
AT LAYLA'S POPS FOR ME?

09:53.150 --> 09:55.070
I WANT HIM TO HEAR
MY NEW TRACK.

09:55.070 --> 09:57.370
IT'S FIRE, BUT I THINK
J.P. KEATING COULD
TURN UP THE HEAT.

09:57.370 --> 09:59.160
WHY NOT JUST DM JAY Z?

09:59.160 --> 10:02.040
I GOT A BETTER CHANCE
OF GETTING HIM ON
THE LINE THAN J.P.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.790
I TRIED TO HAVE HIS
DAUGHTER COMMITTED, COOP.

10:03.790 --> 10:06.500
-TRUE.
-LOOK, YOU AND LAYLA GOOD.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.500
JUST CALL HER.
SHE COULD PROBABLY
USE THE DISTRACTION.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.500
BUT WHAT IF SHE
DON'T THINK I'M READY?

10:10.500 --> 10:12.090
WHY ARE YOU DOWN
ON YOURSELF?

10:12.090 --> 10:14.090
I AIN'T NEVER SEEN
YOU LIKE THIS.

10:14.090 --> 10:16.340
MAN, LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
THE MUSIC GAME LIKE
I KNOW THE STREETS.

10:16.340 --> 10:18.050
IT'S STILL
ALL NEW TO ME.

10:18.050 --> 10:19.760
CLOSED MOUTHS DON'T
GET FED, RIGHT?

10:26.400 --> 10:27.770
LAURA.

10:27.770 --> 10:29.860
WHAT DO YOU WANT, BILLY?

10:29.860 --> 10:32.280
LOOK, I, UH, I KNOW
THAT WE PROMISED JORDAN

10:32.280 --> 10:34.820
THAT WE'D GIVE SIMONE
AND HIM SOME TIME
TO PROCESS,

10:34.820 --> 10:37.530
BUT I THINK THAT MAYBE
WE SHOULD GET TOGETHER
AND DISCUSS

10:37.530 --> 10:40.620
THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW,
JORDAN'S GONNA
BECOME A DAD.

10:40.620 --> 10:42.500
THOUGHT YOU HAD THAT
HANDLED.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.370
AH, COME ON--

10:44.370 --> 10:46.460
LOOK, BILLY, OBVIOUSLY
JORDAN TRUSTS YOU
MORE THAN HE TRUSTS ME.

10:46.460 --> 10:47.460
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

10:47.460 --> 10:49.130
DOESN'T EVEN MATTER.

10:49.130 --> 10:51.710
YOU CLEARLY THINK I CAN'T
HANDLE THE KIDS ALONE.

10:51.710 --> 10:53.840
GREAT. SO HAVE AT IT.

10:53.840 --> 10:58.550
TAKE THE REINS, BILLY.
THEY'RE ALL YOURS.

11:00.600 --> 11:03.310
ROCHELLE: I THOUGHT
SOUTH CRENSHAW
WOULD BE STARTING

11:03.310 --> 11:05.430
THEIR BIG-TIME RECRUIT
FROM NEVADA.

11:05.430 --> 11:07.850
NAH. DARNELL
WENT BACK HOME

11:07.850 --> 11:10.440
AFTER THAT SITUATION
YOUR DAD MADE GO AWAY.

11:13.570 --> 11:16.450
SPENCER: HEY, HEY,
HEY. YOU CAN'T USE
THAT FOOTAGE, MAN.

11:16.450 --> 11:18.280
SPENCER!

11:18.280 --> 11:19.820
NO, I'M SERIOUS.
YOU CAN'T FILM
CRENSHAW'S PRACTICE.

11:19.820 --> 11:21.740
IT'S A CODE
VIOLATION.

11:21.740 --> 11:23.790
AND WE STEPPING ON
THEIR RIGHT TO PRIVACY
BEFORE THE BIG GAME.

11:23.790 --> 11:25.120
WE CAN'T DO IT.
STOP, MAN.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.710
WE'RE NOT FILMING THEM.

11:26.710 --> 11:29.710
WE'RE FILMING YOU
WATCHING THEM.

11:29.710 --> 11:31.840
THIS FIELD IS YOUR
ORIGIN STORY.

11:31.840 --> 11:34.130
WELL, I GOT TO GET BACK
TO MY FIELD, ALL RIGHT,
AND FOCUS ON MY GAME.

11:34.130 --> 11:36.300
CAM: HEY, YO, SPENCE,

11:36.300 --> 11:38.760
WHAT'S UP WITH ALL
THESE CAMERAS, DAWG?

11:38.760 --> 11:40.260
LOOK, IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK.

11:40.260 --> 11:41.720
MAD DISRESPECTFUL, DAWG.

11:41.720 --> 11:44.640
AND I AIN'T EVEN SURPRISED.
YOU JUST A DIRTY PLAYER.

11:44.640 --> 11:47.180
FIRST YOU TAKE OUT OUR QB,
THEN YOU CONVINCED
DARNELL TO LEAVE.

11:47.180 --> 11:48.480
THAT'S NOT
WHAT HAPPENED.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.310
AND NOW Y'ALL OUT HERE
FILMING OUR PLAYS,

11:50.310 --> 11:52.230
TRYING TO PUT OUR TEAM'S
STRUGGLES ON BLAST.

11:52.230 --> 11:53.820
YOU ALL NEED TO LEAVE NOW

11:53.820 --> 11:56.490
BEFORE I HAVE SECURITY
PUT YOUR ASSES OUT.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.530
ROCHELLE, VOICE-OVER:
TWO SEASONS AGO,

12:03.530 --> 12:06.750
YOU HAD 1,100 YARDS
RECEIVING

12:06.750 --> 12:08.580
AND 23 TOUCHDOWNS,

12:08.580 --> 12:10.620
BOTH BEVERLY RECORDS.

12:10.620 --> 12:12.290
IT WAS A GOOD YEAR.

12:12.290 --> 12:14.630
ROCHELLE: LAST YEAR,
YOUR NUMBERS
WERE CUT IN HALF.

12:14.630 --> 12:17.630
500 YARDS, 11 TDs.

12:17.630 --> 12:19.930
SPENCER JAMES TOOK MY SPOT,

12:19.930 --> 12:22.800
BUT WE STILL WON
A STATE CHAMPIONSHIP, SO...

12:22.800 --> 12:26.810
WOULD YOU HAVE WON
THAT STATE CHAMPIONSHIP
WITHOUT SPENCER JAMES?

12:26.810 --> 12:31.730
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
TOUGH WITHOUT HIM, FOR SURE.

12:31.730 --> 12:37.190
BUT I THINK SOMETIMES
WE CONVINCE OURSELVES
WE NEED SOMEONE.

12:37.190 --> 12:40.950
AND WHEN THEY'RE GONE,
LIFE GOES ON.

12:42.950 --> 12:45.530
HOW DID THE INTERVIEW
THING GO?

12:45.530 --> 12:46.990
IT WAS FINE.

12:46.990 --> 12:49.660
WHAT'D THEY ASK YOU ABOUT?

12:49.660 --> 12:52.540
MOSTLY SPENCER JAMES.

12:52.540 --> 12:53.710
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

12:55.210 --> 12:56.380
I, UH, WOULD RATHER
NOT TALK ABOUT

12:56.380 --> 12:57.670
SPENCER JAMES
RIGHT NOW.

13:05.300 --> 13:07.850
HAS YOUR MOM
REACHED OUT AGAIN?

13:11.350 --> 13:13.520
WHAT?

13:13.520 --> 13:15.520
AS IF TALKING ABOUT
SPENCER WASN'T ENOUGH
OF A MOOD KILLER,

13:15.520 --> 13:16.520
MY MOM?

13:16.520 --> 13:19.360
-AH, I'M SORRY.
-HA HA!

13:19.360 --> 13:23.030
I JUST--WE DIDN'T REALLY
CATCH UP. I DON'T KNOW.

13:23.030 --> 13:24.910
I DIDN'T REALLY SEE YOU
AT SCHOOL TODAY.

13:24.910 --> 13:27.370
YEAH. FOR A MINUTE,

13:27.370 --> 13:29.950
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
MAYBE GHOSTING ME.

13:29.950 --> 13:32.250
WELL, I'M HERE NOW.
SO LET'S TALK.

13:32.250 --> 13:34.540
ABOUT MY MOM?

13:34.540 --> 13:35.710
SHE TEXTED ME.

13:35.710 --> 13:37.960
AND WHAT'D SHE WANT?

13:37.960 --> 13:39.920
LIV, IS EVERYTHING OK?

13:41.470 --> 13:43.550
YOU'RE ACTING WEIRD
AROUND ME.

13:43.550 --> 13:47.010
YOU THINK THIS WAS
A MISTAKE?

13:47.010 --> 13:49.010
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.

13:49.010 --> 13:50.980
IT SEEMS LIKE MAYBE
YOU DO KNOW.

13:50.980 --> 13:52.560
ASHER--

13:52.560 --> 13:54.770
WHEN DID YOU STOP
BEING HONEST WITH ME?

13:54.770 --> 13:58.070
I'M JUST PROCESSING.

13:58.070 --> 14:00.280
RIGHT.

14:04.530 --> 14:06.820
ASHER, I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

14:06.820 --> 14:08.530
WHAT'S GOING ON IN MY HEAD.

14:08.530 --> 14:09.950
THAT'S ALL.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.410
YOU DON'T NEED TO
APOLOGIZE. I GET IT.

14:12.410 --> 14:14.580
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

14:23.380 --> 14:25.300
CAM: NO, BUT WHAT
I'M SAYING IS, LIKE,

14:25.300 --> 14:27.050
IF YOU TAKE THAT LIKE THAT,
THEN EVERYBODY ELSE WILL--

14:27.050 --> 14:29.640
CAM.

14:29.640 --> 14:32.060
HEY, WHERE YOUR
CAMERA CREW AT?

14:32.060 --> 14:33.810
THEY GONE.

14:33.810 --> 14:35.640
LOOK, I SHOULD'VE NEVER
BROUGHT THEM
TO THE PRACTICE, MAN.

14:35.640 --> 14:37.440
THAT'S ALL ON ME,
AND I'M SORRY.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.060
SORRY YOU GOT CAUGHT?

14:39.060 --> 14:40.610
I AIN'T NO DIRTY PLAYER.

14:40.610 --> 14:42.530
I'M SORRY YOU ALL
AIN'T GOT CHRIS.

14:42.530 --> 14:43.940
AND AS FOR DARNELL LEAVING,

14:43.940 --> 14:45.360
AIN'T MUCH I
CAN DO ABOUT THAT.

14:45.360 --> 14:46.910
I PREFER TO PLAY YOU ALL
AT YOUR BEST.

14:46.910 --> 14:48.620
BUT, HEY, THAT'S
FOOTBALL, RIGHT?

14:48.620 --> 14:50.030
THE GAME DON'T STOP.

14:50.030 --> 14:51.540
OH, SO YOUR POPS BOUNCES,

14:51.540 --> 14:53.620
AND YOU ALL WIN
AT ANY COSTS, HUH?

15:01.960 --> 15:03.460
THOUGHT YOU WAS
IN NEVADA.

15:03.460 --> 15:06.630
I WAS. I HAD TO COME BACK

15:06.630 --> 15:08.140
AT LEAST UNTIL I
GET SOME ANSWERS.

15:08.140 --> 15:09.970
-ABOUT WHAT?
-WHY COREY LEFT.

15:09.970 --> 15:11.970
-DARNELL, STOP, MAN.
-YO, LOOK...

15:11.970 --> 15:13.810
HE WAS DOING FINE
THAT MORNING.

15:13.810 --> 15:17.100
HE WAS EXCITED ABOUT
COACHING, HIS REUNION,

15:17.100 --> 15:18.730
YOU, DILLON.

15:18.730 --> 15:20.560
I AIN'T GOT NO ANSWERS
FOR YOU, MAN.

15:20.560 --> 15:22.480
OK, BUT MAYBE IF
WE JUST PUT OUR--

15:22.480 --> 15:24.030
I AIN'T TRYING TO BE
MEAN, ALL RIGHT?
I'VE JUST MOVED ON.

15:24.030 --> 15:25.440
YOU SHOULD, TOO.

15:25.440 --> 15:27.780
NAH. I CAN'T JUST MOVE ON.

15:27.780 --> 15:31.490
YOU SOUND JUST LIKE ME
8 YEARS AGO.

15:31.490 --> 15:33.160
YOU GONNA DRIVE
YOURSELF CRAZY

15:33.160 --> 15:35.410
LOOKING FOR ANSWERS
YOU AIN'T NEVER
GONNA FIND, MAN.

15:35.410 --> 15:37.710
COREY IS GONE, ALL RIGHT?
JUST FORGET ABOUT HIM.

15:37.710 --> 15:41.170
FOCUS ON WHAT YOU
GOT LEFT, LIKE YOUR
FUTURE, FOOTBALL.

15:41.170 --> 15:43.710
THERE'S ONE THING
I KNOW ABOUT COREY.

15:43.710 --> 15:47.010
IT'S THAT HE NEVER
BREAKS A PROMISE.

15:47.010 --> 15:48.590
YEAH, AND IF THERE'S
ONE THING I KNOW,

15:48.590 --> 15:50.510
IT'S THAT HE ALWAYS DOES.

15:50.510 --> 15:52.180
I HOPE YOU FIND
YOUR ANSWERS, MAN.
I REALLY DO.

15:52.180 --> 15:55.770
BUT I'M DONE BLAMING
MYSELF FOR HIM LEAVING.

15:55.770 --> 15:57.600
DONE.

16:01.020 --> 16:03.110
SINGER: ♪ EH EH AH AH ♪

16:03.110 --> 16:05.190
♪ I-I-- ♪

16:05.190 --> 16:09.150
♪ I DON'T WANNA SEE
YOU ROLL... ♪

16:09.150 --> 16:13.870
AHEM.
IS THIS SEAT TAKEN?

16:13.870 --> 16:16.950
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

16:16.950 --> 16:18.750
WELL, I WAS HOPING
TO FIND YOU.

16:18.750 --> 16:20.790
HEY, NOW IS NOT
A GOOD TIME, MOM.

16:20.790 --> 16:23.540
WELL, CAN YOU TELL ME
WHEN IS A GOOD TIME,

16:23.540 --> 16:25.420
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN CALLING
YOU AND TEXTING YOU--

16:25.420 --> 16:28.050
AND I HAVE BEEN BUSY.

16:28.050 --> 16:29.760
I GOT A BIG GAME
COMING UP.

16:29.760 --> 16:31.930
-CAN I AT LEAST BUY YOU DINNER?
-DINNER?

16:31.930 --> 16:34.680
OUR LAST MEAL, YOU
ASKED ME TO SERVE DAD
WITH DIVORCE PAPERS,

16:34.680 --> 16:36.470
WHICH SUCKED,
BY THE WAY.

16:36.470 --> 16:38.230
WHAT MESSED-UP FAVOR
DO YOU WANT NOW?

16:38.230 --> 16:45.070
I JUST WANTED TO SEE YOU,
TALK, A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN
WHY WE HAVEN'T--

16:45.070 --> 16:46.780
THIS REALLY ISN'T
FAIR TO ME.

16:46.780 --> 16:50.650
MY ENTIRE FUTURE IS ON
THE LINE THIS SEASON.

16:50.650 --> 16:53.200
MAYBE MY FUTURE
MEANS NOTHING TO YOU.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.740
I DON'T KNOW.

16:54.740 --> 16:56.160
-OF COURSE IT DOES!
-I DON'T CARE, MOM.

16:56.160 --> 16:58.540
BUT IT MEANS
EVERYTHING TO ME.

17:00.910 --> 17:02.670
I GOT TO GO.

17:10.510 --> 17:11.630
COOP: ♪ YEAH, YOU KNOW
IT'S NOT MY STYLE ♪

17:11.630 --> 17:13.930
♪ IT'S NOT MY STYLE ♪

17:13.930 --> 17:17.220
♪ YEAH, YOU KNOW IT'S NOT
MY STYLE ♪

17:17.220 --> 17:20.680
♪ NOT MY STYLE ♪

17:22.190 --> 17:23.770
COOP: UH-OH.
SHE HATED IT.

17:23.770 --> 17:25.230
NO. NO. SHE
DIDN'T HATE IT.

17:25.230 --> 17:27.570
-NO, NO. I DIDN'T HATE IT.
-SEE?

17:27.570 --> 17:29.110
COOP, IT'S REALLY GOOD.

17:29.110 --> 17:31.820
BUT NOT GREAT.
NO, IT'S ALL GOOD.

17:31.820 --> 17:33.950
I GOT SO MANY OTHER TRACKS
YOU MIGHT LIKE.

17:33.950 --> 17:36.780
NO. THE LYRICS ARE PERFECT.
THE SONG COULD BE GREAT.

17:36.780 --> 17:40.120
IT'S JUST MISSING
SOMETHING.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.210
BUT I HAVE AN IDEA.
DO YOU MIND?

17:42.210 --> 17:46.630
-NO. DO YOUR THING.
-OK.

17:46.630 --> 17:50.550
OK. I JUST
WANT MY DAD TO LOVE IT.

17:51.920 --> 17:54.640
OH, OK. SO THE HOOK
YOU HAVE NOW IS

17:54.640 --> 17:56.140
MORE OF LIKE A PRE-CHORUS.

17:56.140 --> 17:58.260
I JUST THINK THE SONG
NEEDS A NEW HOOK, SO...

17:58.260 --> 18:00.770
HERE.
MAYBE TRY THESE LYRICS.

18:03.520 --> 18:07.270
OH, THIS IS PRETTY.
LET ME SEE. AHEM.

18:07.270 --> 18:10.780
OK, LIKE SOMETHING LIKE
THIS PART RIGHT HERE.

18:10.780 --> 18:11.860
LIKE...

18:11.860 --> 18:14.570
♪ YOU CAN STAY,
OR YOU CAN LEAVE ♪

18:14.570 --> 18:17.320
♪ BUT THIS IS ME,
THIS IS ME ♪

18:17.320 --> 18:18.700
THERE IT IS.

18:18.700 --> 18:20.160
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

18:20.160 --> 18:21.620
YOU CAN CHANGE IT.

18:21.620 --> 18:23.540
YO, DID YOU WRITE
THESE WORDS?

18:23.540 --> 18:25.000
LAYLA: OH, NO. MY MOM DID.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.880
WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S
BEEN GOING ON,

18:26.880 --> 18:28.790
I ACTUALLY FORGOT HOW GOOD
OF A SONGWRITER SHE WAS.

18:28.790 --> 18:32.300
SO WHY DON'T WE
RE-RECORD THE DEMO,

18:32.300 --> 18:34.760
AND THEN WE CAN
SEND IT TO MY DAD?

18:34.760 --> 18:37.220
YO, HOW CAN I
THANK YOU FOR THIS?

18:37.220 --> 18:39.260
OH, YOU ALREADY HAVE.

18:39.260 --> 18:41.060
YOU ARE THE ONLY
ONE THAT DOESN'T
TREAT ME LIKE I'M

18:41.060 --> 18:43.310
A GLASS EGG THAT COULD
SHATTER AT ANY TIME.

18:43.310 --> 18:46.940
SO LET'S PLAY IT BACK
AND FIGURE IT OUT.

18:50.860 --> 18:52.940
ROCHELLE: SO WHAT'S
IT MEAN TO BE A LEADER?

18:52.940 --> 18:54.700
YOUR TEAM HAS TO LOOK
UP TO YOU, YOU KNOW.

18:54.700 --> 18:57.870
WHEN YOU'RE QB1, YOU LEAD
BY EXAMPLE.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.830
IT'S ABOUT EARNING THE RESPECT
OF EACH PLAYER ON THE TEAM.

18:59.830 --> 19:05.750
BOYS: JORDAN! JORDAN! JORDAN!
WHOO!

19:05.750 --> 19:07.830
JORDAN: 10 SECONDS, GUYS.
WHO'S GONNA BEAT THAT, HUH?

19:07.830 --> 19:11.880
J.J.: OK, OK. STEP ASIDE.
I'M HERE FOR THE CROWN.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.340
BEAST MODE.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.720
OH, MY GOD.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.720
SINCE WHEN DID
THE PREGAME RITUAL

19:18.720 --> 19:20.390
TURN INTO
AN EATING CONTEST?

19:20.390 --> 19:23.220
YOU CAN THANK YOUR POPS.
THEY JUST SHOWING OUT
FOR THE CAMERAS.

19:23.220 --> 19:25.980
-YEAH!
-LET'S GO! LET'S GO!

19:29.940 --> 19:34.610
HI. IT'S OLIVIA. UM...

19:34.610 --> 19:37.610
I KIND OF REALLY NEED YOU
TO CALL ME BACK

19:37.610 --> 19:40.870
BECAUSE I
REALLY WANT A DRINK,

19:40.870 --> 19:42.790
AND I'M KIND OF
EMBARRASSED TO ADMIT THAT,

19:42.790 --> 19:44.830
BUT THERE'S A LOT GOING
ON WITH MY PARENTS

19:44.830 --> 19:46.830
AND MY BROTHER. AND WHATEVER.

19:46.830 --> 19:49.830
I JUST--I NEED YOU TO WORK
YOUR SPONSOR SUPERPOWERS.

19:49.830 --> 19:52.630
IT'S BEEN A REALLY
ROUGH WEEK.

19:52.630 --> 19:55.050
SIMONE, HI.

19:55.050 --> 19:56.720
-HI.
-HI.

19:56.720 --> 19:58.760
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

19:58.760 --> 20:00.340
I REALLY NEED YOU TO MOVE.

20:00.340 --> 20:02.390
YOUR BROTHER'S NOT
GOING TO GET AWAY WITH
GHOSTING ME, OLIVIA.

20:02.390 --> 20:04.890
I KNOW. HE'S A JERK.
NO ARGUMENT THERE.

20:04.890 --> 20:08.230
I JUST THINK YOU
SHOULD TAKE A BREATH

20:08.230 --> 20:11.270
AND THINK IT OVER
BEFORE CAUSING
A SCENE IN THERE.

20:11.270 --> 20:12.770
I'M JUST GONNA GO
TALK TO HIM.

20:12.770 --> 20:15.280
I KNOW, BUT YOU
SEEM REALLY UPSET.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.940
I AM UPSET.

20:16.940 --> 20:19.820
WHICH YOU HAVE
EVERY RIGHT TO BE, OK?

20:19.820 --> 20:21.950
BUT HE'S IN THERE WITH
HIS TEAM AND CAMERAS.

20:21.950 --> 20:24.790
DO YOU REALLY WANT
EVERYONE IN
YOUR BUSINESS?

20:27.450 --> 20:29.460
HOW DID I BECOME
THIS GIRL, OLIVIA?

20:29.460 --> 20:32.880
YOU MEAN THIS DOPE-ASS,
WON'T-LET-ANYONE-
WALK-ALL-OVER-HER CHICK?

20:32.880 --> 20:35.000
THANKS.

20:35.000 --> 20:40.050
HE'S GONNA CALL YOU,
SIMONE, OK? I PROMISE.

20:42.010 --> 20:44.050
I WAS REALLY ABOUT TO GO
IN THERE AND MAKE A FOOL
OUT OF MYSELF, WASN'T I?

20:44.050 --> 20:47.140
NO. YOU WERE ABOUT
TO MAKE A FOOL
OF JORDAN,

20:47.140 --> 20:51.940
WHICH WOULD HAVE
BEEN FUN TO WATCH,
BUT THIS WAY'S EASIER.

21:00.990 --> 21:03.780
ASHER: WHY NOT?

21:03.780 --> 21:05.120
JORDAN: SHH. ONE SEC.

21:09.040 --> 21:10.210
IS SHE OK?

21:10.210 --> 21:12.040
SHE'S PREGNANT
AND ALONE.

21:12.040 --> 21:14.330
YEAH. UM, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

21:14.330 --> 21:17.840
BE A MAN, JORDAN.
HOW CAN YOU EVEN
LOOK IN A MIRROR?

21:17.840 --> 21:19.460
I KNOW THIS WASN'T
PLANNED, JORDAN,

21:19.460 --> 21:22.010
BUT THIS IS A REALITY
THAT YOU HAVE
TO DEAL WITH.

21:22.010 --> 21:23.840
TAKE SOME DAMN
RESPONSIBILITY.

21:23.840 --> 21:25.470
RESPECT THE MOTHERS
IN YOUR LIFE.

21:25.470 --> 21:28.060
SHE'S ABOUT TO HAVE
YOUR CHILD.

21:28.060 --> 21:30.180
MAKE HER FEEL SUPPORTED
THROUGH THIS.

21:30.180 --> 21:31.350
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

21:31.350 --> 21:33.230
UM, OK.

21:33.230 --> 21:34.480
I'LL CALL HER.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.020
GOOD IDEA.

21:39.320 --> 21:41.860
OH, MAN. WHAT
YOU DOING HERE, MAN?

21:41.860 --> 21:43.280
THE GAME AIN'T TILL
TOMORROW.

21:43.280 --> 21:46.490
NAH, DAWG. WE RIGHT ON TIME.
READY FOR OUR CLOSE-UPS.

21:46.490 --> 21:48.490
LET'S SEE IF YOU'RE
STILL TALKING
AFTER THE GAME.

21:48.490 --> 21:50.830
-SETTLE DOWN, WHITE BOY.
-WHAT?

21:50.830 --> 21:52.080
-CHILL, CHILL, CHILL.
-HEY, YO, CHILL, ALL RIGHT?

21:52.080 --> 21:53.370
LOOK, WE AIN'T HERE
FOR TROUBLE.

21:53.370 --> 21:55.830
MAN, WE GOOD.

21:55.830 --> 21:57.380
DARNELL: PLAYING A WEAK
CRENSHAW TEAM TOMORROW

21:57.380 --> 21:58.840
WILL JUST MAKE Y'ALL
LOOK LIKE BULLIES.

21:58.840 --> 22:00.260
WHAT'S THIS GOT
TO DO WITH YOU?

22:00.260 --> 22:02.050
WHAT IF I CAN MAKE SURE
YOU'RE PLAYING THE BEST?

22:02.050 --> 22:03.470
GIVE THIS GAME SOME REAL
BUZZ FOR Y'ALL's CAMERAS.

22:03.470 --> 22:05.050
YOU GONNA SUIT UP?

22:05.050 --> 22:06.550
NOW, LOOK, I'M NOT
GIVING UP ON FINDING OUT

22:06.550 --> 22:08.260
WHAT HAPPENED TO COREY,

22:08.260 --> 22:10.020
BUT SINCE YOU ONLY
CARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS
ON THE FIELD,

22:10.020 --> 22:12.310
I'LL PLAY FOR
CRENSHAW TOMORROW.

22:12.310 --> 22:15.310
IF YOU BEAT US,
I'LL WALK AWAY.

22:15.310 --> 22:19.270
BUT IF WE WIN, YOU GOT
TO HELP ME FIND OUT
WHY COREY LEFT.

22:19.270 --> 22:21.070
CAM: CAMERA'S ON YOU, DAWG.

22:21.070 --> 22:24.360
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BACK DOWN
FROM A CHALLENGE, HUH?

22:24.360 --> 22:27.030
ALL RIGHT. BET.

22:27.030 --> 22:29.910
AIN'T NO WAY Y'ALL
GONNA WIN.

22:35.290 --> 22:36.420
ANNOUNCER: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

22:36.420 --> 22:40.460
WELCOME TO THE BEVERLY HIGH
CROSSTOWN 7-ON-7 SCRIMMAGE

22:40.460 --> 22:43.260
WITH SOUTH CRENSHAW.

22:55.940 --> 22:57.900
JORDAN, COME ON.
FIRST TEAM'S UP, BOY.
COME ON.

22:57.900 --> 22:59.110
YEAH.

23:00.940 --> 23:02.530
BILLY: LOOK ALIVE.

23:02.530 --> 23:07.820
SIMONE, HEY. UM, I
KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY

23:07.820 --> 23:10.490
ALREADY ON YOUR WAY TO
THE APPOINTMENT, AND...

23:10.490 --> 23:14.830
LISTEN, I'M SORRY, OK,
FOR A LOT OF THINGS.

23:14.830 --> 23:17.040
YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE A MOM...

23:19.580 --> 23:22.460
AND THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT
PERSON IN OUR BABY'S LIFE.

23:22.460 --> 23:24.300
AND I NEED YOU TO KNOW
THAT I PROMISE

23:24.300 --> 23:25.880
I'M GONNA BE
BY YOUR SIDE, OK?

23:25.880 --> 23:27.130
YOU'RE NOT ALONE IN THIS.

23:27.130 --> 23:28.970
LOOK, CAN WE MEET UP LATER
AND TALK?

23:28.970 --> 23:30.470
WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH THIS.

23:30.470 --> 23:32.180
BILLY: JORDAN, LET'S GO.

23:32.180 --> 23:34.890
UM, LOOK, I GOT TO GO,
BUT JUST HIT ME UP, OK?

23:34.890 --> 23:36.480
PLEASE.

23:38.060 --> 23:41.150
YOU KNOW JORDAN WASN'T
PICKING DAD OVER YOU, RIGHT?

23:41.150 --> 23:44.480
I THINK HE WAS
JUST MORE SCARED
OF DISAPPOINTING YOU.

23:44.480 --> 23:47.240
MAYBE HE WAS RIGHT
TO GO TO HIS DAD.

23:47.240 --> 23:50.490
UNDER MY WATCH,
HE CRASHED YOUR CAR,

23:50.490 --> 23:53.040
ALMOST GOT ARRESTED
FOR FIGHTING,

23:53.040 --> 23:55.200
AND GOT A GIRL
PREGNANT.

23:55.200 --> 23:58.330
NONE OF WHICH IS
YOUR FAULT.

23:58.330 --> 24:01.080
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN
OUR ROCK, MOM.

24:01.080 --> 24:03.340
AND JORDAN'S GONNA
NEED YOU,

24:03.340 --> 24:06.170
EVEN IF HE'S TOO DUMB
TO SEE IT YET.

24:24.690 --> 24:28.240
HEY, HEY, BEVERLY HILLS
MOMS ACTUALLY TAKE TIME
AWAY FROM THEY POOL BOYS

24:28.240 --> 24:29.990
TO SHOW UP FOR THEY
SONS, HUH?

24:29.990 --> 24:32.030
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

24:32.030 --> 24:33.910
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
SAVE IT FOR THE GAME, ASH.
CHILL, CHILL, CHILL.

24:33.910 --> 24:36.080
FORGET IT, BRO. COME ON.

24:36.080 --> 24:38.330
ANY WORD FROM J.P. YET?

24:38.330 --> 24:42.210
NAH, BRO. BUT RIGHT NOW,
YOU NEED TO BE FOCUSING
ON THIS GAME.

24:42.210 --> 24:44.130
I'M LOCKED IN. TRUST.

24:44.130 --> 24:46.420
IT'S MY CHANCE TO FINALLY
PUT DARNELL AND COREY
BEHIND ME FOR GOOD.

24:46.420 --> 24:48.470
SO YOU REALLY THINK IT'S
GONNA BE THAT EASY, SPENCE?

24:48.470 --> 24:51.130
COME ON. THAT FIELD
AIN'T GOT MAGICAL POWERS.

24:51.130 --> 24:53.010
SO WHATEVER HAPPENS IN
THIS GAME IS

24:53.010 --> 24:54.680
NOT GONNA MAKE YOUR
MEMORIES OF COREY
JUST DISAPPEAR.

24:54.680 --> 24:57.470

-ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET IT.
"BEVERLY" ON ME.

29:17.480 --> 29:18.780
"BEVERLY" ON 3.
1, 2, 3!

29:18.780 --> 29:20.650
ALL: BEVERLY!
J.J.: LET'S GO, "D."

29:20.650 --> 29:22.320
PUT ME BACK ON "D,"
COACH.

29:22.320 --> 29:24.320
NO. I'M NOT GONNA HAVE
MY STAR PLAYER

29:24.320 --> 29:25.700
GET HURT OUT THERE
ON A BAD PLAY.

29:25.700 --> 29:27.330
LOOK, I'M A BALLPLAYER,
ALL RIGHT?

29:27.330 --> 29:29.290
YOU FORGET WHO I AM?
LET ME BACK ON "D."

29:29.290 --> 29:31.250
I GOT THIS, I PROMISE.

29:31.250 --> 29:32.460
-GET YOUR ASS OUT THERE.
-LET'S GO.

29:33.750 --> 29:35.670
PLAYER: COME ON!

29:35.670 --> 29:37.670
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

29:42.800 --> 29:44.930
ANNOUNCER: CRENSHAW JUST THREW
AN INTERCEPTION.

29:44.930 --> 29:48.350
NUMBER 11 IS GOING TO TAKE IT
ALL THE WAY TO THE END ZONE.

29:48.350 --> 29:50.480
BLOCK 'EM OUT.
GET NUMBER 11.

29:50.480 --> 29:51.940
THERE YOU GO.
LET'S GO.

29:51.940 --> 29:54.650
RUN HIM OVER!
RUN HIM OVER.
LET'S GO.

29:54.650 --> 29:56.820
RUN HIM OVER.
RUN HIM OVER. LET'S GO.

29:56.820 --> 29:59.230
ANNOUNCER: WAIT. NUMBER 11 IS
SLOWING DOWN.

30:04.570 --> 30:07.660
ANNOUNCER: AND NUMBER 11
HAS JUST TAKEN A KNEE.

30:07.660 --> 30:11.700
IF HE DOESN'T GET UP,
IT MEANS BEVERLY FORFEITS.

30:14.790 --> 30:18.380
THAT'S IT? YOU JUST
GONNA FORFEIT?

30:18.380 --> 30:20.710
THIS AIN'T HOW I WAS
TAUGHT TO PLAY THE GAME.

30:20.710 --> 30:22.720
THIS WHOLE REMATCH
WAS WRONG FROM THE JUMP.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.880
I AIN'T TRYING TO WIN
LIKE THIS.

30:27.350 --> 30:29.430
OK.

30:53.580 --> 30:55.500
SOUTH CRENSHAW DIDN'T WIN.

30:55.500 --> 30:57.000
SO I'LL STAY OUT YOUR
WAY AS PROMISED.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.340
WHY DID YOU TAKE
THE KNEE WITH ME, MAN?

30:59.340 --> 31:00.670
YOU AIN'T HAD
TO FORFEIT, TOO.

31:00.670 --> 31:02.050
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE YOU SAID.

31:02.050 --> 31:04.670
THAT'S NOT HOW WE WAS
TAUGHT TO PLAY THE GAME.

31:04.670 --> 31:07.840
DARNELL, HOLD UP.

31:08.850 --> 31:11.310
YOUR THEORIES
ABOUT MY POPS,

31:11.310 --> 31:12.930
YOU GONNA SHARE THEM
WITH ME OR WHAT?

31:12.930 --> 31:14.770
I THOUGHT YOU MOVED ON.

31:14.770 --> 31:16.770
A LONG TIME AGO,
I WAS TAUGHT TO
TACKLE MY PROBLEMS,

31:16.770 --> 31:19.610
BLOCK OUT MY FEARS,
AND--AND ALWAYS--

31:19.610 --> 31:20.940
FINISH STRONG...

31:20.940 --> 31:22.570
BOTH: NO MATTER WHAT.

31:22.570 --> 31:26.070
HA HA! YO, YOUR POPS,
HE SAID THAT ONE A LOT.

31:26.070 --> 31:28.950
I KNOW I TOLD YOU TO
FORGET ABOUT HIM
AND FOCUS ON FOOTBALL,

31:28.950 --> 31:31.660
BUT I REALIZED STANDING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT
MESS OF A GAME TODAY

31:31.660 --> 31:35.000
THAT DOING THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT GOT ME HERE.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.540
I'M DONE RUNNING, MAN.

31:37.540 --> 31:38.960
WE BOTH NEED ANSWERS
ABOUT COREY,

31:38.960 --> 31:41.420
SO LET'S FIND THEM...

31:41.420 --> 31:42.960
TOGETHER.

31:42.960 --> 31:45.420
FINISH STRONG.

IT MEANS EVERYTHING.

32:46.860 --> 32:48.860

YOU SHOULD BE PROUD.

32:48.860 --> 32:50.740

YEAH, YEAH.

32:55.080 --> 32:57.000

LAYLA: YEAH, COOP IS
SUPER TALENTED.

32:59.160 --> 33:00.870

33:00.870 --> 33:03.170
BUT I GOT MAD ARTISTS LIKE
COOP ALREADY ON MY LABEL.

33:03.170 --> 33:05.670
WHAT I DON'T HAVE IS
SOMEONE LIKE PATIENCE.

33:05.670 --> 33:08.880
WHEW! HAVEN'T HEARD
THAT HAUNTING SOUND
SINCE YOUR MOTHER.

33:08.880 --> 33:11.510

YOU GUYS AIN'T THOUGHT
ABOUT BEING A DUO?

33:11.510 --> 33:13.640
NAH. LIKE I SAID,
I'M A SOLO ACT.

-HEY.

35:44.200 --> 35:47.170
COREY WAS ACTING STRANGE
AFTER THE PICNIC.

35:47.170 --> 35:49.710
WHEN I ASKED HIM ABOUT
IT, HE DEFLECTED.

35:49.710 --> 35:52.250
MAYBE IT WAS ALL
THE ATTENTION THEY WERE
GIVING COACH BAKER.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.130
I MEAN, THAT
HAD TO HURT,
BEING REMINDED

35:54.130 --> 35:55.920
HE WASN'T GOOD
ENOUGH TO MAKE
IT TO THE NFL.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.800
BILLY: NO,
BUT HE WAS GOOD ENOUGH.

35:57.800 --> 35:59.680
HE DIDN'T MAKE IT
TO THE LEAGUE
BECAUSE HE WAS SICK.

35:59.680 --> 36:01.010
YEAH, BILLY'S RIGHT.

36:01.010 --> 36:03.680
COREY HAD
MULTIPLE MYELOMA
IN COLLEGE,

36:03.680 --> 36:05.180
BUT HE BEAT IT.

36:05.180 --> 36:10.730
HOLD ON. MULTIPLE MYELOMA?
AIN'T THAT CANCER?

36:10.730 --> 36:12.060
WELL, DOES IT COME BACK?

36:12.060 --> 36:13.400
DARNELL: OH.

36:13.400 --> 36:14.940
WHAT?

36:14.940 --> 36:16.820
NAH, LAST YEAR, UM,

36:16.820 --> 36:18.700
COREY WENT TO PHOENIX
FOR A MONTH.

36:18.700 --> 36:20.700
MOM SAID HE HAD TO
GET A PROCEDURE DONE

36:20.700 --> 36:22.160
BUT WOULDN'T
GIVE ME ANY DETAILS.

36:22.160 --> 36:24.370
COME ON, MAN. AIN'T
NO WAY POPS IS SICK.

36:24.370 --> 36:27.290
AND EVEN IF THE CANCER
DID COME BACK LAST YEAR,
HE BEAT IT AGAIN.

36:27.290 --> 36:30.250
DUDE WAS PLANNING A FUTURE
HERE WITH ME, DILLON, DARNELL.

36:30.250 --> 36:32.380
BILLY: UNLESS HE FOUND
OUT AT THE REUNION

36:32.380 --> 36:35.920
THAT IT HAD COME BACK
FOR A THIRD TIME.

36:35.920 --> 36:37.090
SPENCER: WE REALLY
JUST GONNA KEEP MAKING UP

36:37.090 --> 36:39.130
CRAZY THEORIES
WE CAN'T PROVE?

36:39.130 --> 36:40.890
DILLON: I CAN.

36:42.720 --> 36:44.810
DILLON, BABY,
WHAT IS THAT?

36:44.810 --> 36:46.850
I FOUND IT IN
SPENCER'S ROOM.

36:46.850 --> 36:48.980
IT WAS ADDRESSED
TO DAD.

36:48.980 --> 36:51.270
AND I WANTED
ANSWERS, TOO.

36:51.270 --> 36:52.860
SPENCER: IT'S OK.

36:55.110 --> 36:56.780
DILLON: I GOOGLED THE LAB,

36:56.780 --> 36:58.950
AND THEY'RE HERE IN LOS ANGELES.

36:58.950 --> 37:00.950
AND ONE OF THE THINGS
THEY TEST FOR

37:00.950 --> 37:03.120
IS MULTIPLE MYELOMA.

37:04.870 --> 37:07.870
IS DAD REALLY SICK?

37:07.870 --> 37:11.080
DARNELL: IF COREY IS
SICK, THEN WHY LEAVE?

37:11.080 --> 37:13.420
WHY NOT JUST TELL US?

37:13.420 --> 37:17.050
BILLY: BECAUSE WHEN THIS
KIND OF CANCER COMES BACK,

37:17.050 --> 37:20.800
IT'S AGGRESSIVE
AND LIKELY TERMINAL.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.970
HE PROBABLY DIDN'T
WANT YOU BOYS TO SEE
WHAT HE WAS GOING--

37:22.970 --> 37:25.970
HOLD UP. HOLD UP.

38:34.920 --> 38:36.880

DEPRESSION,

38:36.880 --> 38:39.960

THINGS WERE THAT BAD.

38:39.960 --> 38:42.380

SOMETHING,

38:42.380 --> 38:44.010

39:04.150 --> 39:06.570
I ALWAYS THOUGHT HE WAS
JUST TALKING ABOUT FOOTBALL.

40:21.480 --> 40:23.940
BABY GIRL.

40:23.940 --> 40:25.360
SORRY I'M LATE, GIRL.

40:25.360 --> 40:27.860
SUSPENSE HAS BEEN
KILLING ME.
WHAT'S UP WITH J.P.?

40:27.860 --> 40:29.490
I DON'T THINK IT'S
GONNA HAPPEN.

40:29.490 --> 40:32.450
HE SAID HE ALREADY GOT
TOO MANY ARTISTS
LIKE ME ON HIS SQUAD.

40:32.450 --> 40:33.990
IS HE CRAZY?

40:33.990 --> 40:35.540
DON'T KNOW. I AIN'T
GONNA STOP, THOUGH.

40:35.540 --> 40:36.950
I'M GONNA FIND
THE RIGHT PRODUCER,

40:36.950 --> 40:38.580
AND I'MA DROP
NOTHING BUT HEAT.

40:38.580 --> 40:40.210
WELL, I'M PROUD
OF YOU, BABY.

40:40.210 --> 40:42.330
AND WE DON'T NEED
NO J.P. TO MAKE IT.

40:42.330 --> 40:45.050
ALL I NEED IS US.

SPENCER: AND IF YOU DON'T,
YOU CAN BE SURE

40:47.920 --> 40:49.970
YOU'LL DO SOMETHING
YOU'RE NOT PROUD OF.

40:52.140 --> 40:54.010
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

40:56.060 --> 41:01.650
YOU KNOW, BLACK MEN DON'T
GET THE LUXURY OF GROWING OLD

41:01.650 --> 41:06.360
AND LEAVING THIS EARTH
PEACEFULLY SURROUNDED
BY LOVED ONES.

41:08.110 --> 41:11.910
WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT
THE FACT THAT COREY IS DYING.

41:11.910 --> 41:15.280
THAT'S IN GOD'S HANDS.

41:15.280 --> 41:20.210
WHAT WE CAN DO IS
MAKE DAMN SURE THAT
HE DOESN'T DIE ALONE.

41:20.210 --> 41:23.170
SPENCER, VOICE-OVER:
AND WHEN YOU DO DISCOVER
THE RIGHT THING TO DO,

41:23.170 --> 41:25.420
FINISHING STRONG MEANS
FOLLOWING THROUGH.

41:25.420 --> 41:29.550
YOU SEE, IN FOOTBALL,
YOU NEVER FORGET YOUR LAST PLAY.

41:29.550 --> 41:32.470
BUT IN THE REAL WORLD,

41:32.470 --> 41:36.390
NOBODY WANTS TO LIVE A LIFE
FILLED WITH REGRETS.

41:36.390 --> 41:40.230
OK. COME HERE.
IT'S OK.

41:40.230 --> 41:44.400
