00:02.562 --> 00:05.203
[Haunting music]

00:05.399 --> 00:10.619
Children are something
that I've always longed for.

00:11.873 --> 00:17.773
How is this little boy communicating
with something that's in the house?

00:20.749 --> 00:22.789
[Gasps]

00:24.819 --> 00:28.155
It was like a little
child just running around.

00:28.156 --> 00:30.316
[Screams]

00:32.026 --> 00:36.525
I feel like he wants to interact with me
like a child would interact with their mom.

00:36.526 --> 00:41.266
This is where the
little boy wants to play.

00:41.736 --> 00:45.072
I didn't know what was going on.

00:45.073 --> 00:46.330
Is it a possession?

00:46.331 --> 00:47.908
[Screaming]

00:47.909 --> 00:49.777
I'm like, I can't move.

00:49.778 --> 00:54.698
I can't move my arms.
I can't move my legs.

00:58.299 --> 01:00.759
Where is he?

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074

01:17.172 --> 01:19.915
When I was a kid, on my way to school,

01:19.916 --> 01:22.309
there was this huge Victorian,
and I would always...

01:22.310 --> 01:25.879
Every day, I would stop
to just admire this house.

01:25.880 --> 01:31.780
And I always thought to myself, one
day, I will own a Victorian like that.

01:31.853 --> 01:35.273
You want to check it out?

01:35.656 --> 01:37.490
Visually, it was stunning.

01:37.491 --> 01:40.099
The windows were huge.
The doors were massive.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.723
It was something out of a storybook.

01:41.724 --> 01:44.004
It's big.

01:50.205 --> 01:53.606
This place was built
in 1875 by S.K. Pierce.

01:53.607 --> 01:56.009
It has a lot of history.

01:56.010 --> 01:59.046
There are 26 rooms in total.

01:59.047 --> 02:03.127
They called this the ladies' parlor.

02:07.631 --> 02:10.848
Everything about the house
was just so intriguing.

02:10.850 --> 02:13.327
Let me take you up to the second floor.

02:13.328 --> 02:15.575
There's a lot of choice for bedrooms.

02:15.576 --> 02:18.636
There's ten of them.

02:24.505 --> 02:29.401
I couldn't quite pinpoint
how something this big...

02:29.402 --> 02:32.346
26 rooms, could be this affordable.

02:32.347 --> 02:35.215
Why is the price so low?

02:35.216 --> 02:39.652
Well, it needs a lot of
work, a lot of investment.

02:39.653 --> 02:45.553
I started thinking, I wonder if there's
something structurally wrong with it.

02:45.760 --> 02:50.197
Listen, um, you're nice people.
I'm gonna be straight with you.

02:50.198 --> 02:54.424
There's a lot of history to this place,
a lot of rumors going around about it.

02:54.425 --> 02:57.204
Rumors about ghosts and
crazy things like that.

02:57.205 --> 03:01.525
- Really?
- Yeah, they're just stories.

03:01.842 --> 03:05.379
I was very, very skeptical.
I've always been very skeptical.

03:05.380 --> 03:07.680
Both Lillian and I do
not believe in ghosts.

03:07.681 --> 03:10.850
Uh, do you mind if we look
around a little bit more?

03:10.851 --> 03:13.120
Oh, yeah, sure. Take
as long as you like.

03:13.121 --> 03:14.521
Okay.

03:14.522 --> 03:19.259
Perhaps the rumors of it being haunted
might have brought the price down.

03:19.260 --> 03:22.517
But for both Lily and I, it
was just something that...

03:22.518 --> 03:27.738
We thought it was silly,
and it was great for us.

03:30.771 --> 03:33.831
- The nursery.
- Hmm.

03:44.385 --> 03:47.678
Edwin and I have been
together for about 17 years.

03:47.679 --> 03:53.139
We were born in Puerto Rico,
same town, same hospital.

03:53.394 --> 03:57.230
Children are something
that I've always longed for.

03:57.231 --> 04:00.900
We have a lot of nieces and
nephews, so it always felt...

04:00.901 --> 04:04.801
A strong connection with children.

04:05.406 --> 04:07.623
I have five siblings.

04:07.624 --> 04:10.977
And I've always been the motherly type.

04:10.978 --> 04:14.914
I've mothered them. I
even mother my own mother.

04:14.915 --> 04:16.850
What do you think?

04:16.851 --> 04:18.485
I love it, Ed.

04:18.486 --> 04:20.853
I wanted it so bad.

04:20.853 --> 04:24.580
I didn't give it a second thought about,

04:24.581 --> 04:27.333
you know, the repairs
and the heating and,

04:27.334 --> 04:29.165
you know, how it would be like, the...

04:29.166 --> 04:34.386
Financially... I just...
I really wanted this house.

04:42.576 --> 04:44.577
We were thrilled to move in.

04:44.578 --> 04:48.048
I was just thinking of the stuff
that I could do and accomplish and...

04:48.049 --> 04:52.976
I'd just take my time and
fix her up and get her back...

04:52.977 --> 04:56.337
To how she used to look.

05:10.138 --> 05:12.345
[Loud crash]

05:12.346 --> 05:15.166
Ed? Ed, you okay?

05:15.373 --> 05:18.878
It was as though something had fallen...

05:18.879 --> 05:21.714
I mean, something huge had fallen.

05:21.715 --> 05:24.114
- Ed, you okay?
- Lillian?

05:24.115 --> 05:26.953
- What the hell was that?
- It sounded as though it was bricks.

05:26.954 --> 05:29.622
It almost sounded like
a chimney had collapsed.

05:29.623 --> 05:32.159
We both start asking each
other, what was that noise?

05:32.160 --> 05:33.960
We thought it was down here.

05:33.961 --> 05:35.795
And, no, I thought it was up there.

05:35.796 --> 05:39.395
I heard it clearly. It was upstairs.

05:39.396 --> 05:41.976
[Loud crashing]

06:01.556 --> 06:03.356
The shelf did not collapse.

06:03.357 --> 06:06.573
It was almost, though, as
something physically had...

06:06.574 --> 06:12.474
Stood there and basically knocked
everything down from end to end.

06:16.469 --> 06:22.349
I thought, someone is in the
basement. Someone's hiding out.

06:58.812 --> 07:03.312
It was very dark. It was kind of gloomy.

07:15.363 --> 07:18.097
All of a sudden, I could see something.

07:18.098 --> 07:21.638
I didn't know what it was.

07:32.079 --> 07:37.239
Immediately, I started
thinking, what was in there?

07:47.795 --> 07:50.675
Come look at this.

08:00.808 --> 08:03.936
It's like a huge water tank.

08:03.937 --> 08:07.476
My first impression when I
saw this was like, wow any,

08:07.477 --> 08:13.377
little kid playing down here can
actually fall in there and drown.

08:22.129 --> 08:24.672
When I first moved in across the street,

08:24.673 --> 08:29.336
Edwin and Lillian had been living
in the house for maybe a half a year.

08:29.337 --> 08:32.038
It was rather late in the evening.

08:32.039 --> 08:36.058
I had just come back from running.

08:39.980 --> 08:42.352
One of the lights came on.

08:42.354 --> 08:45.474
And a light went off.

08:46.787 --> 08:50.927
And then another room light came on.

08:52.893 --> 08:55.773
And that went off.

08:56.897 --> 08:59.521
And it would start coming
on a little bit faster.

08:59.522 --> 09:03.482
And then it would go off quicker.

09:04.772 --> 09:07.274
And I thought, this is a little strange.

09:07.275 --> 09:09.615
And then...

09:19.420 --> 09:21.588
I'm looking at three floors here.

09:21.589 --> 09:23.782
It would take, like, 20 people to stand,

09:23.783 --> 09:27.994
by the doors flickering
these lights on that fast.

09:27.995 --> 09:32.965
But then as I'm looking, on the
second floor, I could see somebody.

09:32.966 --> 09:37.404
It looked like it was
a boy, a young boy.

09:37.405 --> 09:43.105
And I thought it strange. I
thought it a little bit odd.

09:49.517 --> 09:51.854
The following day, I saw Edwin.

09:51.855 --> 09:53.912
I went over and talked to him.

09:53.913 --> 09:55.188
Hey, Ed.

09:55.189 --> 09:56.790
Hey, Mike.

09:56.791 --> 09:58.658
Looks like you had your
hands full last night.

09:58.659 --> 10:01.027
I was kind of baffled
by what he meant by that.

10:01.028 --> 10:02.462
He looked, and he said, what?

10:02.463 --> 10:07.066
I said, with the little boy that
was playing in your house last night.

10:07.067 --> 10:11.627
And I said, Mike, I don't have any kids.

10:13.407 --> 10:18.867
I was shocked, because I
know I watched a child play.

10:18.979 --> 10:23.899
I didn't quite understand
what was going on...

10:24.340 --> 10:27.880
What... what this all meant.

10:36.664 --> 10:39.304
[Metal clanging]

10:41.836 --> 10:45.638
I can hear, right by
my pillow, a tapping.

10:45.639 --> 10:47.774
[Metal clanging]

10:47.775 --> 10:50.710
It started getting louder and louder.

10:50.711 --> 10:52.691
Honey?

10:52.880 --> 10:54.381
Do you hear that?

10:54.382 --> 10:57.262
[Clanging continues]

10:57.718 --> 11:01.618
And all of a sudden, it stopped.

11:04.859 --> 11:07.360
[Door creaks open]

11:07.361 --> 11:10.820
The closet door was moving.

11:10.821 --> 11:15.261
And all of a sudden, it stopped halfway.

11:17.204 --> 11:23.104
We couldn't figure out, for the
life of us, what was going on.

11:26.246 --> 11:28.646
[Door slams]

11:30.984 --> 11:32.485
[Pounding on door]

11:32.486 --> 11:34.253
Boom, boom, boom.

11:34.254 --> 11:35.588
Bang, bang, bang.

11:35.589 --> 11:39.992
There was someone physically
knocking on a door.

11:39.993 --> 11:43.713
[Rattling and pounding on door]

11:51.505 --> 11:55.345
I literally have a baseball bat.

11:57.411 --> 12:00.291
[Pounding continues]

12:10.732 --> 12:13.552
[Pounding on door]

12:29.079 --> 12:33.039
He yanked that door open so fast.

12:34.414 --> 12:38.734
I'm walking out into the second floor.

12:59.906 --> 13:02.782
There's nobody around.

13:02.783 --> 13:06.383
There's no one to be found.

13:07.457 --> 13:09.525
[Loud thumping]

13:09.526 --> 13:12.729
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo.

13:12.730 --> 13:15.565
It was not heavy enough to
be, like, a full grown person.

13:15.566 --> 13:18.267
It wasn't that heavy.

13:18.268 --> 13:23.248
It was like a little
child just running around.

13:25.710 --> 13:27.476
[Screams]

13:27.477 --> 13:29.979
And the door just
literally went... slam.

13:29.980 --> 13:33.049
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

13:33.050 --> 13:35.210
[Gasping]

13:35.686 --> 13:38.359
How could this door...

13:38.360 --> 13:41.000
Slam that hard?

13:41.192 --> 13:43.392
It's impossible.

13:43.393 --> 13:48.553
It was like something
wanted to make itself known.

14:02.847 --> 14:05.184
The following day, Edwin had to work.

14:05.185 --> 14:07.851
I was left alone.

14:07.852 --> 14:10.912
I'm in the basement.

14:12.389 --> 14:16.059
I sort everything in
differently sized containers.

14:16.060 --> 14:21.640
I'm down to my last container,
and it has a blue top.

14:23.934 --> 14:27.294
I put the container down.

14:33.510 --> 14:38.190
The lid is there, but
the container isn't.

14:45.156 --> 14:50.559
The container literally
disappeared in front of my face.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.780
[Rustling]

14:53.178 --> 14:57.378
All of a sudden, I heard this noise.

15:00.805 --> 15:03.445
[Child laughing]

15:09.513 --> 15:13.833
It was like a little child's laughter.

15:17.054 --> 15:22.094
It felt like it came
from close to the cistern.

15:23.160 --> 15:26.280
I felt something is...

15:27.057 --> 15:30.357
Almost calling me to it.

15:38.142 --> 15:41.802
To my right is the container.

15:56.793 --> 15:59.733
[Footsteps pattering]

15:59.796 --> 16:02.825
And I see this dark shadow.

16:02.826 --> 16:05.016
It went right by me.

16:05.017 --> 16:08.737
It scared the heck out of me.

16:10.140 --> 16:14.470
At this time, I'm starting to think
that something is in the house,

16:14.471 --> 16:19.571
and it wanted for us to
know that it was there.

16:30.961 --> 16:36.861
We would always, you know, hope and
pray that someday we would have kids.

16:44.308 --> 16:48.499
It was sad. I mean, I went through
a lot of, you know, grief...

16:48.500 --> 16:52.160
And... and um, disappointments.

16:56.287 --> 16:58.454
It didn't quite pan out.

16:58.455 --> 17:02.115
It was just not meant to be.

17:18.699 --> 17:23.646
My son Joshua was
happy-go-lucky, into everything.

17:23.646 --> 17:26.214
He loved to play, into sports.

17:26.215 --> 17:30.186
Sweet kid. Sweet, sweet kid.
Couldn't ask for a better kid.

17:30.187 --> 17:32.979
The moment we moved
into our new apartment,

17:32.980 --> 17:36.623
I noticed him looking at the
big old house, but I didn't...

17:36.624 --> 17:38.506
Think anything of it.

17:38.507 --> 17:41.234
We just moved there. He's looking and...

17:41.235 --> 17:46.135
You know, at our surroundings and
trying to get familiarized with the area.

17:46.136 --> 17:51.116
I didn't think it was
anything to worry about.

17:53.944 --> 17:57.113
Mommy, can I go play
with the little boy?

17:57.114 --> 17:59.515
He wants to come and play catch with me.

17:59.516 --> 18:02.840
I said, well, I want to meet
his parents. And he goes...

18:02.841 --> 18:04.220
Let's go, then.

18:04.221 --> 18:09.525
Josh, give mom a couple days, okay?
I'm gonna get the apartment set up.

18:09.526 --> 18:12.028
We'll go tomorrow, yeah?

18:12.029 --> 18:14.669
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:27.011 --> 18:28.244
Hello.

18:28.245 --> 18:30.894
A couple days after, we
met Lillian and Edwin.

18:30.895 --> 18:32.515
Hi. I'm Lillian.

18:32.516 --> 18:34.844
- Hi. Katie.
- Hi.

18:34.845 --> 18:37.653
Can I play with your son?

18:37.654 --> 18:39.614
I'm sorry. I don't have a son.

18:39.615 --> 18:42.509
Yes, you do. I see him up there.

18:42.510 --> 18:46.526
He wants to come and play
with me in the big hallway.

18:46.527 --> 18:50.307
Um... I just took a step back.

18:50.334 --> 18:52.335
So you've seen a little boy?

18:52.336 --> 18:54.819
I wanted to know more information.
I wanted to know names.

18:54.820 --> 18:56.400
I wanted to know ages.

18:56.401 --> 18:57.973
What does he look like?

18:57.974 --> 19:00.374
Just a boy.

19:01.011 --> 19:03.847
She looked really excited...

19:03.848 --> 19:08.168
That somebody had seen this little boy.

19:08.526 --> 19:10.253
What's he wearing?

19:10.254 --> 19:13.289
He's got on a big white
shirt, big sleeves.

19:13.290 --> 19:17.126
I asked him where exactly
he saw the little boy.

19:17.127 --> 19:21.130
And he said, well, I saw him there.

19:21.131 --> 19:25.928
And yesterday, I saw
him all the way up there.

19:25.929 --> 19:29.168
After answering her
questions, Joshua said...

19:29.169 --> 19:32.433
Can I play with him now, please?

19:32.434 --> 19:34.522
Honey, I don't have any children.

19:34.523 --> 19:37.403
Honestly, I don't.

19:37.881 --> 19:40.029
All the while, he's thinking that I am,

19:40.030 --> 19:44.453
the mother of this child
that he's communicating with.

19:44.454 --> 19:47.516
He described him as though
he can see him so clearly,

19:47.517 --> 19:50.159
not just through a window
or through a sheer curtain.

19:50.160 --> 19:54.840
It's as though he can
see him so vividly.

20:13.244 --> 20:15.411
I didn't believe in ghosts.

20:15.412 --> 20:19.949
But this little boy is seeing him
from across, you know, our yard.

20:19.950 --> 20:24.810
And he's telepathically
communicating with him.

20:27.258 --> 20:33.078
You know, this was supposed
to be a beautiful, loving home.

20:33.430 --> 20:36.966
This was gonna be something
that I've always wanted.

20:36.967 --> 20:40.747
I didn't want a haunted house.

20:53.016 --> 20:55.656
[Wind whistling]

21:10.647 --> 21:13.287
[Metal clanging]

21:14.349 --> 21:17.807
I heard something under the bed.

21:17.808 --> 21:20.748
Tap, tap, tap, tap.

21:23.547 --> 21:28.795
My first thought was, okay,
this could be the child.

21:28.796 --> 21:31.676
[Clanging continues]

22:06.734 --> 22:09.569
I'm not a mom, but I feel that...

22:09.570 --> 22:15.470
When a child looks for his mom and
they want to play, that's what I feel.

22:35.185 --> 22:38.418
I needed Internet in the kitchen.

22:38.419 --> 22:44.179
I fed the wire through behind
the wall where the sink is.

22:44.417 --> 22:47.237
But it got stuck.

22:49.654 --> 22:53.434
I put my hand behind the wall.

22:55.026 --> 22:58.146
I felt something hard.

23:02.184 --> 23:05.364
It was this old spoon.

23:08.125 --> 23:11.005
I went in again...

23:11.462 --> 23:14.342
And felt something.

23:18.241 --> 23:23.206
Maybe a total of 15, 20
little pieces of wallpaper.

23:23.207 --> 23:24.869
I kind of admired it.

23:24.870 --> 23:29.670
It had, like, a teal
blue with a gold trim.

23:29.980 --> 23:34.317
I left it on the corner of that table.

23:34.318 --> 23:37.738
I go to the laundry room.

23:43.153 --> 23:46.273
Maybe an hour later...

23:54.270 --> 23:59.670
The wallpaper was in the
middle of the kitchen floor.

24:10.954 --> 24:15.274
I thought maybe it could be the child.

24:18.585 --> 24:20.565
Hello?

24:21.657 --> 24:25.797
I started talking to the little boy.

24:27.956 --> 24:29.936
Hello?

24:34.216 --> 24:36.384
Are you here?

24:36.385 --> 24:39.054
I even... I even...

24:39.055 --> 24:44.035
Actually, I... I actually
asked it to touch me.

24:46.142 --> 24:49.322
You can come touch me.

24:49.729 --> 24:52.805
And... I don't know... my
motherly instinct kicked in,

24:52.806 --> 24:58.706
and I thought he would touch me,
and I would feel this little hand.

25:01.010 --> 25:03.770
Don't be afraid.

25:05.582 --> 25:08.222
Are you hiding?

25:10.920 --> 25:13.620
Can you see me?

25:18.173 --> 25:20.033
Hey.

25:22.228 --> 25:24.988
Don't be afraid.

25:25.442 --> 25:28.022
Are you there?

25:29.685 --> 25:32.625
[Footsteps scurrying]

25:34.992 --> 25:39.135
It sounds like a little
kid running around.

25:39.136 --> 25:41.683
[Footsteps continue]

25:41.684 --> 25:44.144
Is that you?

25:53.162 --> 25:55.802
[Loud footsteps]

26:03.837 --> 26:06.657
[Breathing heavily]

26:11.909 --> 26:14.032
It was...

26:14.033 --> 26:17.873
Nothing I had ever heard before.

26:18.015 --> 26:21.675
It felt horrible. I was
scared. I was confused.

26:21.676 --> 26:24.887
I didn't know what to do.

26:24.888 --> 26:28.301
I just wanted to go back into the
kitchen area and close the door.

26:28.302 --> 26:31.062
[Door slams shut]

26:37.435 --> 26:38.953
Joshua began changing.

26:38.954 --> 26:42.405
He became obsessed with being outside.

26:42.406 --> 26:45.603
He would literally sit on his bicycle.

26:45.604 --> 26:50.044
And stare at the corner of the building.

26:56.287 --> 26:59.742
Getting him to come inside
was a constant battle.

26:59.743 --> 27:03.093
Hey, what did I tell you?

27:03.094 --> 27:06.214
My friend's up there.

27:10.767 --> 27:12.668
There's nothing there, honey.

27:12.669 --> 27:15.038
Come in. It's cold. Let's go inside.

27:15.039 --> 27:17.799
- No!
- Come on.

27:17.875 --> 27:21.415
Leave me alone! I hate you!

27:22.980 --> 27:24.832
He wasn't the same sweet little boy.

27:24.833 --> 27:27.222
His demeanor had changed.

27:27.223 --> 27:31.063
Everything about him had changed.

27:31.688 --> 27:34.988
And I wasn't having it.

27:35.493 --> 27:38.028
I thought if he saw that
there was no little boy...

27:38.029 --> 27:42.432
There was no toys, there was no
bedroom, there was no nothing...

27:42.433 --> 27:45.668
It would kind of scare him straight.

27:45.669 --> 27:47.404
Hello, Katie.

27:47.405 --> 27:49.091
Hello, Joshua.

27:49.092 --> 27:51.041
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

27:51.042 --> 27:55.910
He gave me that impression
of being a little scared.

27:55.911 --> 27:58.791
How are you, Josh?

28:32.349 --> 28:37.089
This is where the
little boy wants to play.

28:38.089 --> 28:39.755
See, mom?

28:39.756 --> 28:42.925
I told you it was big
enough to play catch.

28:42.926 --> 28:46.429
Every hair on my neck kind of stood
up. And I'm going, this isn't right.

28:46.430 --> 28:48.764
This... this is...
how does he know this?

28:48.765 --> 28:52.005
He shouldn't know this.

29:19.825 --> 29:24.925
So this is where he tells
you to come and play?

29:26.361 --> 29:28.821
Where is he?

29:31.041 --> 29:33.573
For a spirit to...

29:33.574 --> 29:37.494
Get a hold of a little
boy that way and...

29:37.495 --> 29:40.642
Put thoughts in his head and...

29:40.643 --> 29:44.687
Change his behavior and, you know...

29:44.688 --> 29:47.718
Is, to me, frightening.

29:47.719 --> 29:53.599
This was definitely the final
confirmation for me, definitely.

29:54.998 --> 29:57.407
A mother's desire to protect a child,

29:57.408 --> 30:03.168
goes beyond any love that I
think anybody could ever know.

30:03.541 --> 30:09.441
I was not going to allow this little
boy to come in between me and my son.

30:09.513 --> 30:13.293
So we packed up, and we moved.

30:14.951 --> 30:17.831
[Engine turns over]

30:56.493 --> 30:59.313
[Muffled screaming]

30:59.496 --> 31:02.436
I started panicking.

31:06.403 --> 31:07.666
[Muffled] Edwin!

31:07.667 --> 31:09.772
I'm like, I can't move.

31:09.773 --> 31:13.243
I can't look to my left.
I can't look to my right.

31:13.244 --> 31:16.646
I can't move my arms.
I can't move my legs.

31:16.647 --> 31:21.027
It was just the most horrifying feeling.

31:24.321 --> 31:26.601
[Screaming]

31:30.193 --> 31:35.113
- Lil! Lil!
- Get her off me! Get her off me!

31:35.766 --> 31:37.787
She was screaming. She was yelling.

31:37.788 --> 31:38.968
Get her off me!

31:38.969 --> 31:42.405
She was trying to move her arms.
She was trying to move her legs.

31:42.406 --> 31:45.007
Get her off! Get her off me!

31:45.008 --> 31:46.842
I was petrified.

31:46.843 --> 31:48.878
Lil. Lil!

31:48.879 --> 31:52.857
One moment, you're okay, and then
the next moment, you're just...

31:52.858 --> 31:54.484
Frozen, and you can't move.

31:54.485 --> 31:56.519
[Gasps] Get it off me!

31:56.520 --> 31:59.508
She said, tell her to get off me.

31:59.509 --> 32:01.660
Tell her to get off me.

32:01.661 --> 32:02.549
Listen to me.

32:02.550 --> 32:04.460
- Get her off me.
- Sweetie, listen.

32:04.461 --> 32:06.128
Get her off me! I can't move!

32:06.129 --> 32:08.097
Hey, shh. Lil.

32:08.098 --> 32:11.401
Come here. Come here. It's okay. Hey.

32:11.402 --> 32:12.865
[Sobbing]

32:12.866 --> 32:17.306
And I grabbed her, and I just held her.

32:17.775 --> 32:23.295
I said, there's nobody here,
hon. There's nobody here.

32:37.070 --> 32:41.206
I did not feel a
physical pressure on me.

32:41.207 --> 32:45.253
I didn't feel anything holding me down.

32:45.254 --> 32:47.580
Um, but I couldn't move.

32:47.581 --> 32:49.014
[Gasping]

32:49.015 --> 32:51.234
Honey, it's okay.

32:51.235 --> 32:53.995
[Thunder crashing]

32:54.782 --> 32:56.321
[Screaming]

32:56.322 --> 32:58.482
[Screams]

33:02.161 --> 33:07.981
She looked like she was sobbing
uncontrollably, hunched over.

33:13.072 --> 33:17.752
I felt like it was
the mother of the boy.

33:18.778 --> 33:22.032
If you visualize a mother in distress...

33:22.033 --> 33:25.753
And she just lost her child...

33:27.643 --> 33:31.183
She's calling out for help.

33:31.725 --> 33:36.405
I felt her loss as
though it was my loss.

33:42.636 --> 33:44.616
[Sobs]

33:55.081 --> 33:58.621
Things just went really bad.

34:00.286 --> 34:02.146
I...

34:02.468 --> 34:05.504
Was feeling really heavy.
Very... everything...

34:05.505 --> 34:07.059
Just didn't feel right.

34:07.060 --> 34:11.500
I couldn't comprehend what was going on.

34:29.549 --> 34:31.431
I woke up suddenly.

34:31.433 --> 34:34.973
It's just quiet as can be.

34:35.188 --> 34:38.547
But Lillian is not there.

34:59.445 --> 35:01.690
I went down the corridor,
and I started calling.

35:01.691 --> 35:03.315
Lil?

35:03.316 --> 35:06.736
I didn't hear a response.

35:08.054 --> 35:11.714
I couldn't find her anywhere.

35:13.093 --> 35:17.262
I thought there was only one
place left that she could be.

35:17.263 --> 35:19.598
So I went down to the basement.

35:19.599 --> 35:21.699
Lillian.

35:24.871 --> 35:27.091
[Rustling]

35:28.441 --> 35:31.376
I can hear like a ruffling
or shuffling of something.

35:31.377 --> 35:34.257
[Rustling continues]

35:45.158 --> 35:47.258
Lillian?

35:48.494 --> 35:51.374
[Rustling continues]

35:54.934 --> 35:57.754
[Breathing heavily]

35:58.705 --> 36:01.640
She's just digging...

36:01.641 --> 36:04.161
And digging...

36:04.744 --> 36:07.144
And digging.

36:08.514 --> 36:09.848
I didn't know what was going on.

36:09.849 --> 36:11.263
- Lil.
- I have to keep going.

36:11.264 --> 36:14.384
Why? Lil, look at me.

36:14.688 --> 36:18.648
Something was making me dig there.

36:19.358 --> 36:20.993
Stop digging.

36:20.994 --> 36:25.130
She really didn't pay attention
to the words I was saying.

36:25.131 --> 36:27.733
I felt compelled to keep digging.

36:27.734 --> 36:29.735
[Breathing heavily]

36:29.736 --> 36:33.005
Look at me. Lil, honey,
what are you doing?

36:33.006 --> 36:35.074
Stop it, please. Stop it.

36:35.075 --> 36:36.875
Stop it!

36:36.876 --> 36:38.916
Please?

36:41.614 --> 36:47.254
In her hand, I could see that
she was holding something.

36:54.961 --> 37:00.061
She blurted out, this is
what I was digging for.

37:00.867 --> 37:03.987
It was a pelvic bone.

37:07.006 --> 37:10.242
It was small enough to be a
small child, a young child.

37:10.243 --> 37:12.583
It's okay.

37:23.265 --> 37:27.705
I think what he might have gone through.

37:28.111 --> 37:31.238
Was it something horrific?

37:31.239 --> 37:33.579
Something...

37:34.519 --> 37:37.519
Was he in any pain?

37:42.788 --> 37:48.548
We were at the point where
we needed to find out answers.

37:50.716 --> 37:53.886
I need to know who this boy was.

37:53.887 --> 37:56.221
What does he want?

37:56.222 --> 37:59.733
Because this is a Victorian house, you
know, I knew the time period would be

37:59.734 --> 38:02.928
roughly around the 1870s to 1900.

38:02.929 --> 38:07.933
I looked at census records, cemetery
records, birth and death records.

38:07.934 --> 38:11.549
But back in the Victorian
period, I found no evidence,

38:11.550 --> 38:15.473
that there was any death
within the house of a young boy.

38:15.474 --> 38:21.374
I was kind of surprised because I thought
for sure something was gonna turn up.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.339
I was not gonna be
satisfied with that answer

38:23.340 --> 38:26.251
because I really wanted
to help Edwin and Lillian.

38:26.252 --> 38:30.692
Eleanor did some more
intensive research.

38:31.090 --> 38:34.426
She came across a more recent secret.

38:34.427 --> 38:38.330
It was in the '60s that
this house changed forever.

38:38.331 --> 38:41.800
And that's when the other side of
the story started to come forth.

38:41.801 --> 38:44.501
[Knocks on door]

39:01.116 --> 39:06.097
It didn't initially make sense to me how
a house of the stature of the Victorian...

39:06.098 --> 39:09.005
Could have numbers on the doors.

39:09.006 --> 39:14.906
And then I discovered, in the '60s,
they turned it into a boardinghouse.

39:19.367 --> 39:23.747
But the boardinghouse had a sad history.

39:28.327 --> 39:33.487
It was being used, quite
frankly, as a whorehouse.

39:42.656 --> 39:45.570
The woman that they saw
sobbing in the window.

39:45.571 --> 39:50.611
Could very likely be the
spirit of a prostitute.

40:00.807 --> 40:05.247
And the child could have been her child.

40:08.248 --> 40:12.918
He would have seen his mother having to
do what she had to do to take care of him.

40:12.919 --> 40:18.819
And he would have probably been exposed
to a lot of anger, a lot of sorrow.

40:20.197 --> 40:24.937
He probably spent a
lot of time by himself.

40:48.188 --> 40:50.828
[Water splashes]

40:59.466 --> 41:02.706
I feel like he's lost.

41:02.803 --> 41:07.903
And the one person he
wants to find is his mom.

41:08.141 --> 41:12.461
And I think that's why he targets me.

41:20.253 --> 41:21.920
All I wanted to...

41:21.921 --> 41:26.421
Was to have Lillian like she used to be.

41:28.428 --> 41:31.430
I had to get her out of there.

41:31.431 --> 41:33.932
I didn't care how much money we lost.

41:33.933 --> 41:37.311
I wasn't gonna let Lillian
go through that again.

41:37.312 --> 41:39.412
No way.

41:41.616 --> 41:44.496
[Engine turns over]

41:45.645 --> 41:48.313
She wanted him found
by someone... anyone.

41:48.314 --> 41:49.982
And I was there.

41:49.983 --> 41:52.117
And I found him.

41:52.118 --> 41:56.719
And I think that gave
her closure somehow.
