00:00.501 --> 00:02.169
<i>Previously on</i> Bosch: Legacy.

00:05.131 --> 00:07.299
Alexei and Lev Ivanovich.

00:07.383 --> 00:10.094
Bratva royalty.
The boys are gangster princelings.

00:10.094 --> 00:12.096
And Rogers owes these guys
a lot of money?

00:12.096 --> 00:13.556
A ton, from what I heard.

00:13.556 --> 00:16.100
My businesses all took a hit
when I was inside.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.102
He won't fucking haggle with you.

00:18.102 --> 00:19.228
Clock is ticking.

00:19.228 --> 00:25.234
What I really want is to hunt him down
and fucking end him.

00:25.234 --> 00:26.944
What's stopping you?

00:26.944 --> 00:30.322
We can file a wrongful death case,
a survivor action on your behalf.

00:30.406 --> 00:31.240
What's the point?

00:31.240 --> 00:35.286
The point is,
Rogers pays a price for what he did to us.

00:35.286 --> 00:37.413
He had your mother killed,
had me shot.

00:37.413 --> 00:39.790
He was in the bedroom,
waiting for me.

00:39.874 --> 00:42.752
He had a knife.
He told me not to scream.

00:42.752 --> 00:46.046
<i>You think she's gonna be okay?
Preeda Saetang.</i>

00:46.130 --> 00:48.549
The rape victim? Let it go.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.926
I just...
I keep thinking about it.

00:51.010 --> 00:52.636
So stop.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.014
You had a son.
His name was Dominick Santanello.

00:55.014 --> 00:58.017
He was a medic. Died in Vietnam.

00:58.017 --> 00:59.643
I'd like to know more about him.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.896
Whatever you could find out about my son.

01:04.940 --> 01:05.941
Olivia MacDonald?

01:06.025 --> 01:07.485
<i>You wanted to talk to me?</i>

01:07.485 --> 01:08.903
Would you be willing to meet with me?

03:14.194 --> 03:15.029
What's up?

03:15.029 --> 03:17.740
Matthew's been digging up dirt
on Simon Wakefield.

03:17.740 --> 03:19.825
<i>Rogers' right-hand man.
You find something?</i>

03:19.909 --> 03:21.911
Not on Wakefield, on his son.

03:21.911 --> 03:23.913
Even better.
What are we talking about?

03:23.913 --> 03:26.999
Big-time bank fraud.
I'll spare you the details.

03:26.999 --> 03:29.501
So you're gonna use
the info on his son

03:29.585 --> 03:30.502
to squeeze Wakefield?

03:30.586 --> 03:32.171
Until he gives up Rogers.

03:33.172 --> 03:35.382
Could work.
Nice job, Counselor.

03:35.466 --> 03:37.343
I thought so.
Where are you?

03:37.343 --> 03:39.720
- Oxnard.
- <i>What's in Oxnard?</i>

03:39.720 --> 03:41.847
Chasing a lead.
I'll be back later today.

03:41.931 --> 03:42.765
On Rogers?

03:42.765 --> 03:43.933
No, something else.

03:43.933 --> 03:46.226
I'll see you when I see you.

03:47.519 --> 03:48.938
Marty.

03:48.938 --> 03:50.898
Have you got time
to talk to a prospective client?

03:50.898 --> 03:52.566
Uh, sure, what's the case?

03:52.650 --> 03:56.445
Wrongful arrest. It was LAPD.
Mistaken identity.

03:56.445 --> 03:57.529
Based on what?

03:57.613 --> 04:00.991
I mean, if it's a shaky eyewitness
or a bad photo lineup,

04:01.075 --> 04:02.451
have Matthew or Louise take it.

04:02.451 --> 04:04.411
Facial recognition software.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.246
Really?

04:06.330 --> 04:09.500
Uncharted legal territory.
This could be one of those seminal cases.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.835
Okay, okay, okay, don't oversell it.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.837
I'll put him in the conference room.

04:17.883 --> 04:21.720
Nick Santanello was my brother.

04:21.804 --> 04:23.055
Your adoptive brother.

04:23.055 --> 04:25.307
Yes, we were both adopted
by the Santanellos.

04:28.352 --> 04:30.312
How did your parents
know his birth mother's name?

04:30.396 --> 04:34.108
They both met Vibiana
when they went to St. Helen's

04:34.108 --> 04:35.234
to take Nick home.

04:36.694 --> 04:39.154
I have often wondered about Vibiana.

04:40.322 --> 04:43.242
I know Nick did it.
Do you know what happened to her?

04:44.451 --> 04:46.245
She died shortly thereafter.

04:46.245 --> 04:48.539
Oh, dear. How?

04:48.539 --> 04:50.666
She took her own life.

04:50.666 --> 04:51.959
Did she?

04:53.377 --> 04:56.422
Oh, I am so glad Nick never knew that.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.095
Uh...

05:06.473 --> 05:10.686
I wasn't sure that I was
gonna show you these, but...

05:11.687 --> 05:12.521
Here.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.662
Where was this taken?

05:28.746 --> 05:31.081
Basic training. Camp Pendleton.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.628
Name on the shirt. Lewis?

05:36.712 --> 05:39.423
That was a friend of his,

05:39.423 --> 05:42.509
a fellow medic
who couldn't pass the swim test,

05:42.593 --> 05:44.887
so Nick put on his shirt
and took the test for him.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.265
Was Nick drafted?

05:48.265 --> 05:50.309
Enlisted.

05:51.226 --> 05:52.227
Why a medic?

05:52.311 --> 05:56.273
He wanted to be a doctor.
He had plans.

05:57.524 --> 05:58.942
His helicopter was shot down

05:59.026 --> 06:01.737
two weeks before
he was due to come home.

06:01.737 --> 06:05.908
Such a waste.

06:10.788 --> 06:12.039
I'm sorry.

06:12.039 --> 06:15.042
It was a long time ago.

06:17.461 --> 06:21.423
Yeah, but you still send him a message
nearly every day.

06:23.634 --> 06:25.469
I miss him every day.

06:26.887 --> 06:27.930
I know you do.

06:29.807 --> 06:31.725
I was wondering,
is there any possibility

06:31.809 --> 06:34.561
you might still have
some of his belongings around?

08:20.500 --> 08:24.129
I have no idea who she is. Sorry.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.758
If I can get these printed,
I'll send you copies.

08:27.758 --> 08:29.760
Please.

08:29.760 --> 08:33.180
I'm out in the driveway
helping my boy with his bike chain.

08:33.180 --> 08:36.975
And all of a sudden,
three cop cars roar up.

08:37.059 --> 08:40.270
Next thing I know,
my face is on the ground,

08:40.354 --> 08:43.774
got a knee in my back,
and I'm cuffed up.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.027
Wife's screaming.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.322
Son's crying.

08:50.322 --> 08:52.741
Six years old.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.409
How's he supposed to understand?

08:54.493 --> 08:55.619
Why did they arrest you?

08:55.619 --> 08:58.038
Detective said
I robbed some Korean corner store

08:58.038 --> 08:58.997
I never set foot in.

08:59.081 --> 09:01.375
Did you get the detective's name?

09:02.417 --> 09:03.335
Gutierrez.

09:03.335 --> 09:06.421
And what did you tell Detective Gutierrez
when he arrested you?

09:06.505 --> 09:11.218
"You got the wrong guy. It's a mistake.
I got an alibi."

09:11.218 --> 09:12.719
But he was dug in.

09:12.803 --> 09:16.348
Said some computer
IDed me as the guy who did it.

09:16.348 --> 09:17.391
Facial recognition.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.226
That's it.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.478
Did the police check your alibi?

09:21.478 --> 09:22.854
Far as I know, not.

09:23.939 --> 09:27.067
What about Gutierrez?
Did you talk to him after your arrest?

09:27.067 --> 09:28.568
Never saw him again.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.530
Two weeks in that hellhole,

09:31.530 --> 09:34.408
never talked to nobody
except the lady from Legal Aid.

09:34.408 --> 09:37.160
Were you working
at the time of your arrest?

09:38.161 --> 09:38.996
Steady.

09:38.996 --> 09:40.372
And since your release?

09:41.456 --> 09:43.542
They gave my job away.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.168
Ain't had another one since.

09:46.503 --> 09:49.339
Google my name,
see what comes up.

09:49.423 --> 09:51.216
Shit's gonna follow me
till the day I die.

09:52.342 --> 09:56.096
What happened to you is inexcusable.
I'm so sorry.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.180
Thank you.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.059
But I want them to be sorry.

10:01.143 --> 10:03.103
Pay for what they done to me
and my family.

10:03.103 --> 10:08.900
We're gonna do everything in our power
to make sure that happens.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.363
They're almost 50 years old.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.866
And kept in an attic, basement,
mini-storage ever since?

10:15.866 --> 10:16.783
Garage.

10:16.867 --> 10:19.619
I can tell. Cupping, cracking...

10:19.703 --> 10:21.705
Can you salvage them?

10:21.705 --> 10:23.457
Oh, you must be laboring
under the misconception

10:23.457 --> 10:24.458
I'm a miracle worker.

10:24.458 --> 10:25.751
What, you're not?

10:25.751 --> 10:28.920
We can try rewashing.
No guarantees.

10:29.004 --> 10:29.838
What's your time frame?

10:30.839 --> 10:31.673
Day before yesterday.

10:32.591 --> 10:34.551
The woman and the child?
Can you do those first?

10:34.551 --> 10:37.220
It's gonna cost you. Can you afford me
now you're not on the department's dime?

10:37.304 --> 10:38.722
Me? No.

10:38.722 --> 10:40.432
But my client can.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.357
Ida, what am I looking at?

10:48.357 --> 10:51.777
A check for $20,000
to St. Helen's Maternity Home,

10:51.777 --> 10:53.195
with a personal note from you.

10:53.195 --> 10:55.989
- You think 20,000 is enough?
- Sir?

10:57.574 --> 10:59.368
Seems paltry. Considering.

10:59.368 --> 11:02.746
Well, we can discuss an annual gift.
In perpetuity.

11:02.746 --> 11:05.207
- Let's do that.
- Discuss it?

11:05.207 --> 11:07.000
No, let's do it.

11:07.084 --> 11:08.919
I'll initiate the paperwork.

11:16.635 --> 11:18.637
Ida, Ida, Ida...

11:19.721 --> 11:22.974
I don't know what I would do without you.

11:23.058 --> 11:24.893
Nor I you, sir.

11:30.732 --> 11:33.276
Maybe we should do a door knock.

11:35.404 --> 11:36.905
Just to make sure she's okay.

11:38.115 --> 11:40.659
It'll take two minutes,
it's just right around the corner.

11:40.659 --> 11:43.245
Don't know how many times I gotta say it.

11:43.245 --> 11:46.039
We're not detectives
and we sure as shit aren't social workers.

11:46.123 --> 11:48.250
Case belongs to Sex Crimes now.

11:51.086 --> 11:52.003
I know, but--

11:52.087 --> 11:54.965
Look. They got their job
and we got ours.

11:54.965 --> 11:57.592
And we can't do ours
if you keep worrying about theirs.

11:59.553 --> 12:00.512
Feel me?

12:01.763 --> 12:02.639
I feel you.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.433
- That's the Hotel Del, in Coronado.
- Mm-hmm.

12:06.101 --> 12:08.311
Any way to figure out
when these pictures were taken?

12:08.395 --> 12:10.272
No time stamp on the film.

12:10.272 --> 12:13.108
I can tell you when
the film itself was made.

12:13.108 --> 12:17.320
"Seventy-two-AJ"? It was made
between April and June 1972.

12:17.404 --> 12:21.741
Guy who took these pictures was in Vietnam
December '71 to December '72,

12:21.825 --> 12:22.909
then he was killed in action.

12:22.993 --> 12:26.580
So how could he have taken them
on the beach at Hotel Del?

12:27.956 --> 12:29.332
What I was wondering.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.546
Hello, Mrs. Cheong?

12:34.546 --> 12:35.464
Yes?

12:35.464 --> 12:39.176
My name is Honey Chandler
and this is my associate, Matthew Ramirez.

12:39.176 --> 12:40.135
Yes?

12:40.135 --> 12:43.847
I understand you had an armed robbery here
a couple of months ago.

12:43.847 --> 12:45.307
He put a gun in my face.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.393
I was afraid I was going to die.

12:48.477 --> 12:50.687
Well, believe me,
I know exactly how you feel.

12:50.687 --> 12:51.938
I don't think so.

12:53.773 --> 12:54.774
I don't think you do.

12:54.858 --> 12:57.277
I have been the victim
of gun violence too.

12:58.612 --> 12:59.446
You?

12:59.446 --> 13:03.617
A home invasion.
I was shot twice.

13:03.617 --> 13:04.534
No.

13:04.618 --> 13:05.452
Yes.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.037
Oh, how terrible for you.

13:08.538 --> 13:11.458
There are many bad people in this city.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.002
There's so many good people too,
like you.

13:14.002 --> 13:15.587
Thank you.

13:15.587 --> 13:17.839
Would you mind
if we asked you a few questions?

13:18.715 --> 13:19.549
No, I don't.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.384
Detective Gutierrez filled us in.

13:21.468 --> 13:22.677
Certainly.

13:22.761 --> 13:24.429
Matthew, will you take notes?

13:24.513 --> 13:25.347
Of course.

13:27.599 --> 13:28.475
Are we being taped?

13:29.351 --> 13:34.022
Oh, yes.
We tape everything, 24/7.

13:42.030 --> 13:44.741
Ms. MacDonald?
Olivia MacDonald?

13:44.741 --> 13:46.368
Can I help you?

13:46.368 --> 13:47.327
We're from the VA.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.578
Veteran's Administration.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.664
I know what the VA is.

13:50.664 --> 13:51.748
Of course you do.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.334
Do you have a moment to speak to us
about Dominick Santanello?

13:54.960 --> 13:55.794
Who?

13:55.794 --> 13:58.421
Don't be disingenuous, Ms. MacDonald.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.839
Dominick Santanello.

13:59.923 --> 14:00.924
Your brother.

14:09.224 --> 14:11.768
Don't worry,
there's nothing he can do to you.

14:11.768 --> 14:14.271
Well, I'm worried about
what I might do to him.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.691
Just give me a minute to duck.

14:30.287 --> 14:31.955
Carl Rogers, you've been served.

14:31.955 --> 14:33.331
What the hell is this?

14:33.415 --> 14:34.249
Look.

14:36.751 --> 14:39.087
"Estate of Donna Sobel v. Carl Rogers.

14:39.087 --> 14:41.381
Complaint for wrongful death."

14:41.381 --> 14:43.675
What the fuck?
Are you fucking kidding me?

14:43.675 --> 14:46.344
You people, get out of here.
He was acquitted.

14:46.428 --> 14:47.721
He wasn't acquitted, he escaped.

14:47.721 --> 14:51.933
Do you really think I'd let you get away
with murder, you malevolent fuck?

15:14.748 --> 15:15.582
Bosch.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.710
It's Olivia.
Olivia MacDonald.

15:18.710 --> 15:19.794
Everything okay?

15:19.878 --> 15:21.630
Well, you know, I'm not sure.

15:21.630 --> 15:23.256
After you left yesterday,

15:23.340 --> 15:26.301
two men came to the house
and said they were from the VA.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.094
What did they want?

15:28.178 --> 15:31.681
They said that Nick had
some outstanding death benefits

15:31.765 --> 15:33.141
that I might be entitled to.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.726
About 40 years late.

15:34.726 --> 15:37.187
And why I come to the house?
Why not just send a letter?

15:37.187 --> 15:38.521
That's what I thought.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.274
They asked if he'd ever been married
or had any children,

15:41.358 --> 15:42.942
<i>and I told them no.</i>

15:43.026 --> 15:44.152
What'd they say?

15:44.152 --> 15:46.112
They said that
that's what their records show,

15:46.196 --> 15:48.740
but that they just wanted
to make sure.

15:48.740 --> 15:52.118
Anyway, I just thought you should know.

15:52.202 --> 15:53.453
Okay, I wouldn't worry about it.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.538
If they come knocking again,
you let me know, yeah?

15:55.622 --> 15:57.540
Okay, will do.

16:12.931 --> 16:16.393
Fuck. Who are those guys?

16:21.731 --> 16:23.608
<i>It's game over. Take your fucking gun.
Let's go.</i>

16:23.692 --> 16:26.277
<i>- Why? Why?
- No, no, no, no, no. Don't fuck with me.</i>

16:31.533 --> 16:32.367
What you got?

16:32.367 --> 16:35.203
Trouble.
I was clean when I went up to Oxnard.

16:35.203 --> 16:36.746
No tracker, no tail.

16:36.830 --> 16:39.207
Somebody somehow figured out
I was up there.

16:39.207 --> 16:40.125
How do you know?

16:40.125 --> 16:41.668
Went up there to do an interview.

16:41.668 --> 16:45.255
Later that day, two guys show up
at my client's door asking questions.

16:45.255 --> 16:48.007
And now these fuckers
are back on my tail again.

16:48.091 --> 16:51.803
I got a question of my own.
When's the last time you looked up?

16:53.304 --> 16:54.139
Drone?

16:54.139 --> 16:57.475
Best guess.
What are you gonna do now?

16:57.559 --> 16:59.894
Turn in my rental
and get my jeep back.

16:59.978 --> 17:02.272
No, no, no, I meant, like, what do
you wanna do? Another shake and bake?

17:02.272 --> 17:05.817
No. No, these guys are too good.
Time to play possum.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.736
Assume we're bugged and tailed.

17:07.736 --> 17:09.195
And droned.

17:09.279 --> 17:10.488
And don't know about it.

17:29.591 --> 17:32.177
I retrieved a still photo
of the robbery suspect

17:32.177 --> 17:35.096
from the store surveillance video
and submitted it

17:35.180 --> 17:38.475
to the LACRIS facial recognition system
for comparison.

17:38.475 --> 17:39.934
And is this the photo you submitted?

17:41.936 --> 17:42.771
Yes.

17:42.771 --> 17:46.858
So the facial recognition software
compared this photo of the robbery suspect

17:46.858 --> 17:50.069
with photos from L.A. County's
digital mugshot system?

17:50.153 --> 17:53.573
That's right. Your client is in the system
because he's got a record.

17:53.573 --> 17:58.077
And the software hit on Russell Barnes'
mugshot as a positive match.

17:58.161 --> 18:01.831
Now, when you say "positive match,"
you don't consider the result

18:01.915 --> 18:04.334
to be a definitive identification
of the suspect.

18:04.334 --> 18:05.251
No, no.

18:05.335 --> 18:08.338
Because in fact,
facial recognition technology is notorious

18:08.338 --> 18:12.675
for misidentifying people of color
at far higher rates than Caucasians.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.761
Objection.
Use of the word "notorious."

18:14.761 --> 18:16.679
I'll rephrase.

18:16.763 --> 18:20.433
Known for misidentifying
people of color at higher rates.

18:20.517 --> 18:21.810
I can't speak to that.

18:21.810 --> 18:23.853
It's a legitimate investigative tool

18:23.937 --> 18:26.439
used by law enforcement
across the country.

18:26.523 --> 18:30.318
All right, despite these caveats,
once you got this positive hit,

18:30.318 --> 18:34.113
you focused your investigation
solely on Mr. Barnes, correct?

18:34.197 --> 18:35.865
He was our prime suspect.

18:35.949 --> 18:36.825
Were there any others?

18:36.825 --> 18:38.159
Suspects?

18:38.243 --> 18:40.119
- Yes.
- No.

18:47.210 --> 18:49.003
What the fuck, Lev? Jeez.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.798
I didn't see you.
Where'd you come from?

18:51.798 --> 18:54.092
You scared the living shit out of me.

18:54.092 --> 18:55.385
Going somewhere?

18:56.928 --> 18:58.972
I'm meeting my girlfriend.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.391
I thought maybe lawyer.

19:01.391 --> 19:03.142
No. No.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.396
Imagine my surprise. Hmm?

19:06.396 --> 19:09.816
Read it in paper, also social media,

19:09.816 --> 19:13.444
you are sued for millions of dollars.

19:14.612 --> 19:17.282
Lawsuits are the cost
of doing business in this town.

19:17.282 --> 19:18.783
It's just a nuisance.

19:18.867 --> 19:21.411
Trust me,
you'll get your money.

19:21.411 --> 19:22.871
We're oh-so close.

19:25.039 --> 19:26.916
We have saying in Russia.

19:27.917 --> 19:32.463
Elbow is close, but one cannot bite it.

19:32.547 --> 19:33.631
Fuck does that mean?

19:34.632 --> 19:39.387
Close only counts in horseshoes
and hand grenades.

19:50.523 --> 19:54.068
Okay, so after you have this
<i>possible</i> positive match,

19:54.152 --> 19:57.238
did you compare
Mr. Barnes' fingerprints or DNA

19:57.322 --> 20:00.617
with evidence left by the robbery suspect
at the crime scene?

20:00.617 --> 20:02.869
No usable DNA or prints
were found at the scene.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.163
Did you investigate
Mr. Barnes' alibi?

20:05.163 --> 20:06.372
Didn't have to.

20:06.456 --> 20:09.417
We compared his mugshot
to the surveillance photo of the suspect.

20:09.417 --> 20:12.921
It was obvious the two men
were one and the same.

20:12.921 --> 20:14.088
Obvious to you.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.593
Is this the mugshot of Mr. Barnes
you used for your visual comparison?

20:18.593 --> 20:19.677
Yes.

20:19.761 --> 20:22.764
And did you ever inspect
Mr. Barnes in person?

20:23.765 --> 20:24.599
No.

20:24.599 --> 20:27.644
Well, if you had, you would have
noticed that while the robbery suspect

20:27.644 --> 20:31.230
has several prominent tattoos
on his right arm,

20:31.314 --> 20:34.817
Mr. Barnes' arms are tattoo-free.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.838
Sloan. What brings you here?

20:58.007 --> 20:59.217
Mr. Vance sent me.

21:00.510 --> 21:03.221
He'd like to know if you've made
any more progress in your investigation.

21:03.221 --> 21:07.308
Mr. Vance instructed me
to report only to him, no one else.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.106
You don't wanna do that.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.777
Mr. Vance has taken ill.

21:17.777 --> 21:22.281
And he's unable to speak to you,
so he would like you to report to me.

21:22.365 --> 21:24.575
And I'm happy to do so
when I hear from <i>him.</i>

21:25.743 --> 21:27.996
Ask Mr. Vance to call me
when he's feeling better.

21:44.512 --> 21:46.514
Mr. Vance, it's Harry Bosch.

21:46.514 --> 21:48.099
Please give me a call
when you have a chance.

21:48.099 --> 21:49.934
I need to speak to you
about something.

21:51.728 --> 21:54.772
So this beat-to-shit car screams
through the light,

21:54.856 --> 21:56.566
literally right in front of us.

21:56.566 --> 22:00.361
I call it in, my T.O. puts the pedal
to the metal, lights and sirens.

22:00.445 --> 22:01.446
We finally get him to pull over.

22:01.446 --> 22:02.864
T.O. takes point?

22:02.864 --> 22:04.407
Of course, 'cause he's gotta show me
how it's done.

22:04.407 --> 22:09.579
So he goes up to the driver's window,
and I swear to God he turns red.

22:09.579 --> 22:15.376
Then he waves me over, all frantic.
So I walk up, take a look inside.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.086
And?

22:17.170 --> 22:19.797
And the guy's wife
has her feet up on the dash

22:19.881 --> 22:22.341
with a baby's head
coming out of her chucha.

22:24.010 --> 22:24.844
What did you do?

22:25.887 --> 22:28.389
Fucking T.O. wasn't
about to roll up his sleeves,

22:28.473 --> 22:30.808
so Mamacita and I, we got it done.

22:30.892 --> 22:34.771
Baby boy, seven pounds ten ounces.

22:34.771 --> 22:36.439
- I hope they named him after you.
- They did.

22:36.439 --> 22:38.649
- No way.
- Way. Little Rico.

22:41.903 --> 22:44.072
Okay, Molina, you're up.

22:44.072 --> 22:45.740
Okay. Um...

22:47.325 --> 22:48.326
It's my first jumper call.

22:48.326 --> 22:50.536
Came out as a possible.

22:50.620 --> 22:52.246
Hollywood and Highland
Shopping Center.

22:52.330 --> 22:54.540
We drop everything,
race over there.

22:54.624 --> 22:58.419
We get there
and Fire's deflating their cushion,

22:58.503 --> 22:59.337
Shrink's taking off the harness.

22:59.337 --> 23:00.588
Don't tell me he already jumped.

23:01.714 --> 23:05.259
Yup. Must've hit the blacktop
going 70 miles an hour.

23:05.343 --> 23:06.219
You see him?

23:06.219 --> 23:07.303
Fuck yeah.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.806
His ass was pancaked.

23:09.806 --> 23:12.558
Just a sack of broken bones.

23:12.642 --> 23:15.978
And I'm like,
"Dude, think about the chump

23:16.062 --> 23:17.814
who's gotta scrape you
off the pavement,

23:17.814 --> 23:20.942
have the courtesy to OD instead,
you know."

23:24.112 --> 23:28.699
Oh, Maddie, you had that broad daylight
prowler rape call in Thai Town, right?

23:29.617 --> 23:30.618
She okay? Your vic?

23:34.831 --> 23:35.706
As far as I know.

23:39.919 --> 23:40.753
Um...

23:41.379 --> 23:42.588
Uh, excuse me.

24:24.547 --> 24:26.632
Hey, Mads, little late.

24:27.341 --> 24:28.176
Did I wake you?

24:28.176 --> 24:32.847
No, no. I was just going over
some house insurance paperwork.

24:32.847 --> 24:33.764
Everything okay?

24:34.891 --> 24:37.185
It's fine, I was just calling to say hi.

24:37.185 --> 24:38.519
Night out?

24:40.521 --> 24:42.148
Classmates from the Academy.

24:43.649 --> 24:46.194
You know, boots only?

24:46.194 --> 24:47.695
I remember.

24:47.695 --> 24:49.197
Everybody's got their first war story.

24:50.406 --> 24:51.657
Exactly.

24:51.741 --> 24:53.242
<i>You tell yours?</i>

24:57.121 --> 24:59.790
Mm, I didn't feel like sharing tonight.

25:01.083 --> 25:02.460
Something you wanna talk about?

25:03.461 --> 25:05.421
I'm good.
I was just calling to say hey.

25:05.421 --> 25:06.339
<i>Okay.</i>

25:08.090 --> 25:11.469
I'm here always, all ways.

25:13.512 --> 25:14.347
Yeah, I know.

25:14.347 --> 25:16.515
You wanna come by,
say hey to Coltrane?

25:23.064 --> 25:26.067
Thanks, Dad. I think I'm gonna go home
and get some sleep.

25:26.067 --> 25:26.984
<i>You sure?</i>

25:27.068 --> 25:28.861
Give him a scratch for me.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.739
<i>You're not driving, are you?</i>

25:31.739 --> 25:33.950
Not to worry. Called an Uber.

25:33.950 --> 25:34.867
Good.

25:35.910 --> 25:36.744
Love you.

25:37.954 --> 25:38.955
Me too.

25:38.955 --> 25:40.039
Night.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.040
Good night.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.138
That's Hotel Del.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.432
It was in his effects.

25:58.516 --> 26:02.520
He probably took that photo
between April and December 1972.

26:02.520 --> 26:03.854
Why those dates?

26:03.938 --> 26:06.357
Film was manufactured April '72,

26:06.357 --> 26:08.401
December '72
he was killed in Vietnam.

26:08.401 --> 26:10.027
Your working hypothesis?

26:10.111 --> 26:12.154
He spent a couple days in San Diego.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.531
Middle of his tour.

26:13.531 --> 26:14.907
Ah, trips to the mainland
were prohibited.

26:14.991 --> 26:15.992
He would've risked court martial.

26:17.952 --> 26:19.996
I went to Honolulu for my R and R.

26:19.996 --> 26:21.289
The airports were full of MPs

26:21.289 --> 26:24.292
on the lookout for guys
trying to sneak back to the mainland.

26:24.292 --> 26:28.713
That military haircut was a dead giveaway,
not to mention the uniform.

26:28.713 --> 26:30.298
Maybe his hair was longer.

26:30.298 --> 26:32.174
He did keep a stash of civvies
at his sister's.

26:32.258 --> 26:34.427
Well, then he might have made it.

26:34.427 --> 26:36.095
Pretty risky, though.

26:37.138 --> 26:40.558
Risk worth taking if it meant
seeing his new baby girl.

26:43.436 --> 26:44.603
Hey.

26:44.687 --> 26:47.440
Can you recommend
a private, reliable lab

26:47.440 --> 26:48.441
<i>for DNA comparison?</i>

26:48.441 --> 26:49.525
Let me guess.

26:49.525 --> 26:51.986
Maddie finally realized
she's too smart to be your daughter

26:51.986 --> 26:54.071
and now you're scrambling
to prove she is.

26:54.155 --> 26:55.614
Funny.

26:55.698 --> 26:56.657
Well, you're in a fine mood.

26:56.741 --> 26:57.575
<i>Actually, I am.</i>

26:57.575 --> 27:00.244
Making headway on my case.
I just need a good lab.

27:00.369 --> 27:01.912
Well, I've worked with
a couple of good ones.

27:01.996 --> 27:02.997
I'll send you their names.

27:02.997 --> 27:04.957
Great, thanks. Bye.

27:09.170 --> 27:10.546
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, Harry.

27:10.546 --> 27:12.256
How'd he do?

27:12.340 --> 27:14.800
Such a good boy.
Did all his business.

27:16.969 --> 27:17.970
That's new.

27:18.054 --> 27:20.598
Yeah, present from Maddie.
It's my favorite movie.

27:20.598 --> 27:22.475
<i>"Yo-jim-bo."</i>

27:22.475 --> 27:24.810
<i>Yojimbo.</i> It's Japanese.

27:24.894 --> 27:26.062
What's it about?

27:26.062 --> 27:30.649
It's about a ronin.
That's a samurai without a master.

27:30.733 --> 27:32.234
On his own. Independent.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.903
Kinda like a private eye.

27:33.903 --> 27:35.446
Yeah, kinda.

27:35.446 --> 27:36.697
But with a sword.

27:36.781 --> 27:38.282
Cool.

27:38.366 --> 27:40.868
See you tomorrow.
Bye, Coltrane.

27:45.498 --> 27:46.415
Mo.

27:46.499 --> 27:49.001
Hey, Rogers is on the move.
Wakefield's with him.

27:49.085 --> 27:50.044
<i>A sit-down.</i>

27:50.044 --> 27:50.961
Where?

27:51.045 --> 27:52.797
Some diner in the South Bay.

27:52.797 --> 27:54.340
Eat at Rudy's.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.633
Got it. I'm on it.

28:03.224 --> 28:05.017
Hey, I need boots on the ground.

28:06.227 --> 28:07.520
Beautiful South Bay.

28:07.520 --> 28:10.147
I owe ten originally,
but now they want 40.

28:12.024 --> 28:14.902
The only way I could swing that
is by doing a second tap.

28:16.112 --> 28:18.781
You have any idea
how much this increases our risk?

28:18.781 --> 28:20.825
I couldn't agree more.

28:20.825 --> 28:23.577
It is reckless in the extreme.

28:23.661 --> 28:24.954
They're breathing down my neck.

28:26.330 --> 28:30.042
They fucking know where I live.
What choice do I have?

28:31.919 --> 28:33.254
Can you hear what they're saying?

28:34.797 --> 28:36.257
Not a word.

28:36.257 --> 28:40.761
But from their body language, I'd wager
they're not exactly bosom buddies.

28:40.845 --> 28:44.515
It's more like that meet
between Michael Corleone and Sollozzo.

28:45.850 --> 28:46.851
Is that One or Two?

28:46.851 --> 28:50.604
One. The sit-down in the restaurant
where they speak Sicilian.

28:52.565 --> 28:53.566
Can you hear anything?

28:56.861 --> 28:57.778
Not a damn thing.

28:58.779 --> 28:59.655
Try this.

29:03.033 --> 29:03.909
What the hell is this?

29:03.993 --> 29:06.287
Some gadget I got
from Bosch's tech guy.

29:06.287 --> 29:09.248
It's like a mini-shotgun mic
and recorder.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.376
Stick it in your phone
and hit record.

29:22.178 --> 29:23.053
Bupkis.

29:25.306 --> 29:27.892
I think we're just meant to record it,
not hear it.

29:27.892 --> 29:29.226
Swell.

29:29.310 --> 29:33.939
So, Russ, you're gonna have
to shut this down in the next 48 hours.

29:34.023 --> 29:35.524
It's impossible.

29:35.608 --> 29:37.401
Scheduled maintenance
isn't for another three weeks.

29:37.485 --> 29:39.320
Then you've got to do a hot tap.

29:39.320 --> 29:40.696
No fucking way.

29:42.948 --> 29:45.075
It's suicide. That's insane.

29:45.159 --> 29:48.537
Fuck no. Way too dangerous.

29:48.621 --> 29:52.583
I'm not sending my guys down there
unless it's completely shut down.

29:52.583 --> 29:55.085
Okay, then it's on you, Russ.

29:55.169 --> 29:57.379
Get the scheduled maintenance
moved up

29:57.463 --> 29:59.215
and shut the damn thing down ASAP.

29:59.215 --> 30:02.343
Jesus, you're not listening.

30:02.343 --> 30:05.763
The more you take,
the harder it is for me to hide it.

30:05.763 --> 30:07.431
They're sure to notice a second tap.

30:07.515 --> 30:09.141
You'll find a way.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.688
Looks like we're adjourned.

30:19.568 --> 30:22.863
Just remember,
if anything starts to go sideways,

30:22.947 --> 30:26.492
I can erase this complete operation
in an instant.

31:00.734 --> 31:01.986
Calmed down now?

31:01.986 --> 31:03.862
It's me and my men at risk here.

31:07.575 --> 31:09.577
Everybody wants to make it safe.

31:11.620 --> 31:12.454
Don't be late.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.708
Just make sure you're prepared.

31:16.750 --> 31:19.378
My men could be prepared
before I even hit the freeway.

31:19.378 --> 31:20.838
Everybody good?

31:20.838 --> 31:22.715
If you say so.

32:25.694 --> 32:27.571
Go ahead.

34:37.451 --> 34:38.327
<i>Hello.</i>

34:38.327 --> 34:41.413
Yeah, I need a second pair of eyes.

34:41.497 --> 34:43.248
Been telling you that for years.

34:43.332 --> 34:47.294
Yeah, Poly First Corporation.
They're in Carson.

34:47.294 --> 34:49.671
On it like a bonnet.

34:49.755 --> 34:50.756
<i>Bite me.</i>

34:52.049 --> 34:54.301
Cheese dick.

34:54.301 --> 34:55.677
1.2 million.

34:57.596 --> 34:58.680
Without even going to trial?

34:59.598 --> 35:02.392
That's what the city will pay
to make this go away right now.

35:04.645 --> 35:07.314
Oh, man.

35:08.315 --> 35:09.316
I never dreamed--

35:09.316 --> 35:12.778
I think the real question
we need to be asking ourselves is,

35:12.778 --> 35:14.029
do we want this to go away?

35:14.029 --> 35:15.030
Of course we do.

35:15.030 --> 35:17.157
Russell, we have a really strong case.

35:17.241 --> 35:21.078
And I'm almost certain we'd win
at trial with a much bigger payday.

35:24.790 --> 35:25.958
How long would that take?

35:25.958 --> 35:28.460
A year, maybe.

35:31.880 --> 35:32.965
No, thanks.

35:34.383 --> 35:38.720
You suffered a serious injustice
because of this flawed technology,

35:38.804 --> 35:41.223
this lazy cop, the way the system works.

35:42.224 --> 35:45.519
This is our chance
to start to change the system.

35:45.519 --> 35:47.020
Just a little bit.

35:48.021 --> 35:49.940
A lot can happen in a year.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.902
What am I supposed to live on
in the meantime?

35:53.986 --> 35:56.029
We can help you find a job.

36:02.995 --> 36:04.288
I'm gonna take the money.

36:06.039 --> 36:07.040
Thanks anyway.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.004
Okay.

36:16.967 --> 36:18.844
So far, I've managed
to clean up this part.

36:18.844 --> 36:21.805
Now, it's a terrible recording.
There's all kind of ambient noise.

36:21.889 --> 36:22.723
Here we go.

36:24.683 --> 36:27.936
<i>You're gonna have
to shut this down in the next 48 hours.</i>

36:31.940 --> 36:32.774
That's it?

36:34.026 --> 36:34.860
So far.

36:37.446 --> 36:39.114
Forty-eight hours. Great.

36:39.114 --> 36:43.285
Uh, Rogers, Wakefield,
and these two, Pensak and Aslan.

36:43.285 --> 36:44.912
You're retired.

36:44.912 --> 36:46.496
Some of us more than once.

36:46.580 --> 36:48.665
How'd you get DMV photos?

36:48.749 --> 36:50.584
- We know a guy.
- Say no more.

36:50.584 --> 36:52.461
We may be gone,
but we're not forgotten.

36:52.461 --> 36:54.838
Actually, we're forgotten,
but not gone.

36:54.922 --> 36:56.924
Well, I'm not questioning your methods,

36:56.924 --> 36:58.717
I mean, far be it from me,
I'm just curious.

36:58.717 --> 37:00.594
What do we know about these two?

37:00.594 --> 37:04.765
Well, Pensak is a pipeline operator
for the Drysdale Oil refinery.

37:04.765 --> 37:07.017
Responsible for controlling
the flow of gas

37:07.017 --> 37:09.144
through the company's
pipeline network.

37:09.144 --> 37:11.021
And Aslan runs Aslan Inc.

37:11.021 --> 37:14.608
He runs fleets of freight trucks
and gasoline tankers.

37:14.608 --> 37:19.488
And... he owns this.

37:22.866 --> 37:23.825
What are we looking at?

37:23.909 --> 37:29.122
Manufacturing plant. PVC pipes.
Closed down about five years ago.

37:29.206 --> 37:31.166
Security like Fort fucking Knox.

37:31.166 --> 37:34.419
He's got security patrols, cameras,

37:34.503 --> 37:38.840
and every 20 minutes, the doors open,
a gas tanker comes out,

37:38.924 --> 37:41.635
another tanker goes in,
the door shuts.

37:41.635 --> 37:43.011
Just tankers?

37:43.095 --> 37:44.221
Mm-hmm, around the clock.

37:44.221 --> 37:45.555
Why is this interesting?

37:45.639 --> 37:50.519
Why the security?
Why the heavy tanker traffic here?

37:50.519 --> 37:51.812
It's not a filling station.

37:51.812 --> 37:53.563
Unless it is.

37:53.647 --> 37:58.026
But it's not. In my humble opinion,
something ain't kosher in Denmark.

37:58.110 --> 38:01.405
And you couldn't hear what they
were discussing during the meeting?

38:01.405 --> 38:04.616
Mm-mm, but it was tense,
I can tell you that much.

38:04.700 --> 38:06.159
Mo's cleaning up that recording.

38:06.243 --> 38:07.869
What do you think they're up to, Harry?

38:09.162 --> 38:10.747
I think...

38:10.831 --> 38:12.541
I need to get into that building.

38:34.730 --> 38:36.023
Hey, hey. Hey, buddy.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.943
I think you left your wallet
in there on the counter.

38:40.027 --> 38:41.278
I don't think so.

38:41.278 --> 38:43.363
Sure looks like you.

38:44.531 --> 38:47.409
What, are you blind?
That don't look nothin' like me.

38:48.577 --> 38:52.497
Oh, jeez. My mistake. I'm sorry.

38:52.581 --> 38:55.083
And hey, hey, pal.

38:55.167 --> 38:56.251
Have a nice night.

38:57.461 --> 38:58.295
Yeah.

39:26.615 --> 39:27.449
He buy it?

39:27.449 --> 39:28.658
Not a chance.

39:28.742 --> 39:30.160
No surprise.

39:30.160 --> 39:31.244
You know, I've been told

39:31.328 --> 39:33.914
this driver's license photo of me
is a real stunner.

39:33.914 --> 39:35.123
Who told you that?

39:35.207 --> 39:37.334
Lady who took it at the DMV.

39:37.334 --> 39:40.170
She administer the vision test too?

42:04.689 --> 42:06.107
Let me get the keys to the office.

42:06.191 --> 42:07.359
Yeah, yeah.

44:29.959 --> 44:31.336
Shit.

44:58.655 --> 45:00.949
On to you, you son of a bitch.

45:58.923 --> 45:59.757
Hands up!

46:01.634 --> 46:02.969
Now!

46:08.725 --> 46:10.935
<i>Coming up on</i> Bosh: Legacy.

46:11.019 --> 46:13.730
"Last Will and Testament
of Whitney Vance.

46:13.730 --> 46:15.190
Hieronymus Bosch,
sole executor."

46:15.190 --> 46:16.483
What do we do next?

46:16.483 --> 46:19.277
<i>You keep working your case.
Confirm Vance has an heir.</i>

46:19.277 --> 46:20.653
<i>We see who makes a move.</i>

46:21.446 --> 46:22.739
Nicole wasn't even there.

46:22.739 --> 46:24.282
But now she's an accessory.

46:24.282 --> 46:27.202
You have got to swear
that you're gonna keep her safe.

46:27.202 --> 46:29.162
I'm gonna do everything I can, Mrs. Davis.

46:29.162 --> 46:32.665
<i>She's only helping him
so she can come home and be with Kalon.</i>

46:32.749 --> 46:35.001
We need to do something
about this DNA situation.

46:35.001 --> 46:36.252
What options am I looking at here?

46:36.336 --> 46:37.337
Inside.

46:37.337 --> 46:39.923
<i>I haven't seen Carl in days.</i>

46:39.923 --> 46:44.761
I swear. I don't know where he is.

46:46.221 --> 46:47.347
<i>You need to make careful decisions.</i>

46:47.347 --> 46:50.975
I represent people who reward those
who make careful decisions.

46:51.059 --> 46:52.810
If I were still a cop,

46:52.894 --> 46:55.271
I'd arrest you for threatening an officer
and attempted bribery.

46:55.355 --> 46:56.314
But you're not.

46:57.190 --> 46:58.358
- <i>Detective.</i>
- <i>LT.</i>

46:58.358 --> 46:59.859
You see that press conference?

46:59.943 --> 47:03.446
LAPD knew Nicole was not a threat.
This is not acceptable.

47:03.530 --> 47:05.365
She did take the cash.
She got back in the car.

47:05.365 --> 47:07.784
What could we do?
We need to stick together on this.

47:09.911 --> 47:12.914
What if I never
feel like myself again?

47:12.914 --> 47:14.541
Having second thoughts?

47:14.541 --> 47:15.625
About the job?

47:16.668 --> 47:17.627
No.

47:17.627 --> 47:19.337
I understand you have work for me.

47:19.337 --> 47:21.548
Indeed, I do.
