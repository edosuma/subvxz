01:14.199 --> 01:15.492
So what are you saying?

01:17.077 --> 01:21.039
Sometimes taking control means
letting go.

01:21.123 --> 01:23.959
Yeah, and now you're getting
a divorce?

01:24.042 --> 01:26.003
Neither of us are moving out.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.380
Things will stay mostly
the same.

01:28.463 --> 01:30.883
It's just now
we'll be roommates.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.510
Dad, you're okay with this?

01:33.594 --> 01:35.512
Yeah, I guess.

01:36.680 --> 01:37.973
Nothing lasts forever.

02:21.308 --> 02:22.309
Hey.

02:22.976 --> 02:23.977
Hi.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.273
So my parents are insane. I have
no idea what they're doing.

02:29.525 --> 02:31.193
They told me they're getting
a divorce.

02:31.276 --> 02:32.528
- So-
- My god.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.196
Are you okay?

02:35.489 --> 02:37.616
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just- I can't believe

02:37.699 --> 02:40.327
they're giving up so easily.
It's so, like, mediocre.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.622
Why is your Lego all over
the place?

02:43.705 --> 02:46.917
- Sorry, I-
- Just clean up your shit, okay?

02:51.630 --> 02:52.840
You sure you're okay?

02:55.884 --> 02:57.553
Do you want me to make
you a drink?

02:59.054 --> 03:02.266
Yes. And bring me, like, five
pounds of cake.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.560
Remember our flat
on the 6th of Paris?

03:05.060 --> 03:06.770
We can get treats anytime
we want.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.773
I would sell my ovaries
for a macaron right now.

03:11.275 --> 03:12.943
Want to tell me what happened
with your parents?

03:13.026 --> 03:16.113
No, I just- I don't want
to talk about it.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.198
Okay.

03:19.408 --> 03:20.868
Is there anything you want
to do?

03:33.380 --> 03:34.381
So you don't want to tell me

03:34.464 --> 03:36.133
what happened with Matt
and Carol?

03:36.884 --> 03:39.970
They gave up. The just had it
all, and they gave it up.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.723
But, you know, it's their lives.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.641
They can fail if they want to,
it's not us.

03:46.935 --> 03:47.936
No, it's not.

03:48.020 --> 03:49.938
That's why I didn't want
to talk about it.

03:50.022 --> 03:52.566
But I do want to talk about
is how we're going to make sure

03:52.649 --> 03:54.902
it doesn't happen to us.

03:54.985 --> 03:58.322
We've been together five years,
and I turned 30 last month.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.406
So...

04:01.617 --> 04:04.912
Okay, alright...

04:04.995 --> 04:06.246
Okay, what can we do?

04:07.247 --> 04:10.709
Well, like, goal setting.

04:10.792 --> 04:14.087
You know, making the most out
of our lives.

04:14.171 --> 04:16.464
Striving for the best

04:16.548 --> 04:18.926
for ourselves
and for each other.

04:19.009 --> 04:24.181
I feel like that's maybe
a bit of a superficial solution

04:24.264 --> 04:26.141
to a problem that doesn't exist.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.810
- Tom.
- Well, no, I- I'm just-

04:28.894 --> 04:31.021
Okay, I'm sorry. Alright.

04:32.356 --> 04:35.400
Specifically, what do you want
to do?

04:36.735 --> 04:41.323
I don't know. I can improve
my French,

04:41.406 --> 04:44.660
and make new business plans.

04:44.743 --> 04:50.624
And you can get serious about
finding a job,

04:50.707 --> 04:53.085
and working out, and even make
some new friends.

04:53.168 --> 04:57.297
Okay, I mean, my friends
just hang out

04:57.381 --> 05:00.092
and talk about my old work.
It's really embarrassing.

05:00.175 --> 05:03.220
I'm sorry. How am I not
serious about finding a job?

05:04.012 --> 05:08.141
I don't know. I just- I'm not
here during the day.

05:08.225 --> 05:12.729
I come home and I see you
drinking and playing Legos,

05:12.813 --> 05:15.732
and I don't know.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.910
What do I have to do next?

05:26.994 --> 05:29.162
Add the sugar gradually.

05:34.585 --> 05:36.545
I just don't understand
why are lives are so inadequate

05:36.628 --> 05:38.046
all of a sudden.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.967
I don't think that's
the right word.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.511
Okay, what's the right word?

05:48.182 --> 05:50.517
It's more like-

05:50.601 --> 05:52.603
You know what, I'm just going
to go to bed.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.021
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, it's okay.

05:54.104 --> 05:55.272
- No, but I-
- It's fine.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.357
- I said I'm sorry.
- It's fine, it's fine.

05:57.858 --> 05:58.859
Tom.

06:26.929 --> 06:29.348
You're up early.

06:29.431 --> 06:32.684
Yeah, early bird gets the worm.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.646
I packed you lunch,
it's in the fridge.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.648
Yeah, I already got it.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.609
I put a French lesson
on your phone.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.694
Thank you.

06:42.778 --> 06:44.363
- See ya.
- Bye.

06:47.199 --> 06:51.245
And so this is our main shared
work area at Module 45.

06:51.328 --> 06:54.206
Now, usually when people start
out, we recommend they just get

06:54.289 --> 06:56.875
a basic membership
because that gives you access

06:56.959 --> 06:59.962
to all our communal spaces
and amenities.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.047
We also have shared conference
rooms on this floor,

07:02.130 --> 07:05.092
as well as printing
and scanning facilities.

07:05.175 --> 07:08.637
And this is our workroom. Some
of our members require more-

07:08.720 --> 07:11.557
a room for drafting,
assembling prototypes,

07:11.640 --> 07:13.559
or just small scale production.

07:13.642 --> 07:16.144
Thank you so much.
Okay, we'll see you soon.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.190
Okay, so gather
around everybody.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.693
As most of you know,
this is my last day.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.903
I'll still try to keep things
short and sweet.

07:24.987 --> 07:26.196
You suck.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.073
Thank you, I love you too.

07:28.156 --> 07:30.701
So before I move on
to my new life,

07:30.784 --> 07:34.204
I would like to introduce
all of you to my new successor.

07:34.288 --> 07:37.249
The new managing director
of Module 45,

07:37.332 --> 07:38.417
David Pallini.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.626
'Pallini.

07:39.710 --> 07:41.211
- Pallini.
- Thank you.

07:44.298 --> 07:47.509
I think all of us know
who the real beating heart

07:47.593 --> 07:48.677
of this place is.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.263
Yes, Mr. Lauren Frank.
I'm talking about you.

07:52.431 --> 07:55.017
I wish I had more than
compliments and cupcakes

07:55.100 --> 07:56.810
to give you, but there it is.

07:56.894 --> 07:58.187
Take it away, David.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.189
Well, thank you for that, Alex.

08:00.272 --> 08:03.609
I, I got to say I have
nothing but admiration

08:03.692 --> 08:04.818
for the heart of working staff

08:04.902 --> 08:07.696
and community members
of Module 45.

08:07.779 --> 08:10.949
I am so excited about working
with all of you

08:11.033 --> 08:12.409
to maximize your potential.

08:38.101 --> 08:40.062
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.856
Are you calling with good news?

08:44.232 --> 08:47.986
Well, you know, sometimes
no news is good news, right?

08:48.070 --> 08:49.655
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

08:49.738 --> 08:51.031
They said they'd get back
to you today,

08:51.114 --> 08:52.699
so there's still
time.

08:55.077 --> 08:58.914
I have to go,
but I'll call you back,

09:01.458 --> 09:02.459
Lauren.

09:03.627 --> 09:04.920
David.

09:05.003 --> 09:08.715
- You're looking well.
- Thank you. So are you.

09:08.799 --> 09:11.009
Five years is a long time,
but I can't tell.

09:12.427 --> 09:13.804
Well, thank you.

09:14.263 --> 09:16.014
I thought I would've run
into you again at one

09:16.098 --> 09:17.558
of the enterprise conferences.

09:17.641 --> 09:21.812
No. That was, just
something I did for grad school.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.692
Did you know that I worked here?

09:27.234 --> 09:29.236
You're just an added bonus.

09:30.863 --> 09:32.739
You and me are going to make
a good team.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.368
If you don't mind,

09:36.451 --> 09:39.288
I think it's important that
we keep things professional.

09:39.371 --> 09:41.790
I just don't want to give anyone
the wrong impression.

09:41.874 --> 09:43.375
I don't mind.

09:43.458 --> 09:46.295
Makes me curious as to what
the wrong impression would be.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.592
You're coming out
with me tonight.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.096
My life is really different now.

09:56.180 --> 09:57.222
So is mine.

10:00.142 --> 10:02.644
- I should get back to the fro-
- Name a place first.

10:05.063 --> 10:07.399
You're not leaving here
until you name a place.

10:11.612 --> 10:12.613
Hi.

10:13.155 --> 10:17.201
Yes, could I speak to HR,
please? Thank you.

10:17.284 --> 10:20.078
Hi, my name is Tom Anderson.
I was calling to follow up

10:20.162 --> 10:22.122
about an interview
I had there last week.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.084
Two weeks? Wow.
Okay, great.

10:26.168 --> 10:27.961
Well, no, I look forward
to hearing from you.

10:28.045 --> 10:30.464
Thanks have a grea- Yep,
day, bye.

10:52.361 --> 10:54.905
You didn't really want
to be manager anyway.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.326
- Are we going out tonight?
- Of course.

11:00.452 --> 11:01.703
Where do you want to go to?

11:12.381 --> 11:14.132
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:16.969 --> 11:19.096
Did the stairway smell like
pee to you?

11:21.014 --> 11:22.683
It definitely smelled like pee.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.018
Come see what I'm making.

11:25.102 --> 11:27.145
Let me get a drink first.

11:30.107 --> 11:32.150
Okay. Show me what you got.

11:32.901 --> 11:36.196
Okay, so it's just underway.
It's not good yet.

11:36.280 --> 11:39.950
But this is a model
of Robel City Hall.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.368
Same curvature.

11:41.910 --> 11:44.538
I don't know what I'm going
to do for the circular

11:44.621 --> 11:47.708
council chambers in the middle,
but I'll figure something out.

11:48.458 --> 11:49.751
It's going to look great.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.923
I like how you have them
organized by color.

12:01.263 --> 12:04.183
- What?
- Nothing, you're just cute

12:04.266 --> 12:05.642
is all.

12:53.982 --> 12:55.567
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.736
You look really nice.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.446
Thank you.

12:59.530 --> 13:00.864
You better be more
of a gentlemen than you

13:00.948 --> 13:01.949
were this afternoon.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.078
So, how was your first day?

13:06.161 --> 13:08.372
I don't think anyone's too
thrilled about the new kid

13:08.455 --> 13:10.874
in town, but they'll
come around.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.251
You're confident.

13:15.754 --> 13:18.632
I thought we were going to keep
things professional.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.008
Why?

13:20.092 --> 13:21.593
I know you're attracted to me.

13:21.677 --> 13:24.012
Yeah, that's-
It's not about that.

13:24.096 --> 13:26.348
Okay, I thought this would
be an issue,

13:26.765 --> 13:29.685
Module 45 hired me
instead of you, okay?

13:29.768 --> 13:31.645
That's a setback,
but you should use

13:31.728 --> 13:34.940
this as inspiration to ask
questions about yourself.

13:35.023 --> 13:38.277
I'm going to be my best self
at all times.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.948
I can understand how it
could come across that way,

13:43.031 --> 13:45.659
but that's not actually
what I meant.

13:49.580 --> 13:50.581
You invited them?

13:50.664 --> 13:52.916
I bet you're good in front
of an audience.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.169
- Hello.
- Hi.

13:55.252 --> 13:57.963
You didn't tell us you
were bringing company.

13:58.046 --> 13:59.673
- I'm Renata.
- David.

13:59.756 --> 14:00.966
- Pleasure.
- And you are?

14:01.049 --> 14:02.509
- I'm Nikki.
- Nikki.

14:02.593 --> 14:04.678
- Hi, Miranda.
- Miranda.

14:05.387 --> 14:09.057
Miranda is so thirsty,
and so am I.

14:09.141 --> 14:10.934
Well, I guess I better get
the first round.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.061
Sure thing. Don't hurry back.

14:13.145 --> 14:14.771
I can't believe that you brought
me a man.

14:14.855 --> 14:19.151
I- He asked me out.
I didn't know what to say.

14:19.234 --> 14:20.652
It's his first day.
I'm trying to be polite,

14:20.736 --> 14:23.572
and so I told him to come here.
I'm sorry.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.949
So he thinks this is, like,
a day?

14:26.033 --> 14:28.160
So you didn't bring me a man.

14:28.243 --> 14:31.413
Okay, you can have him,
because it's nothing.

14:31.496 --> 14:35.083
I just haven't had a chance
to tell him about Tom yet.

14:35.834 --> 14:36.835
Okay.

14:37.503 --> 14:39.171
- Drinks are on the way.
- Great.

14:40.464 --> 14:43.383
- What did I miss?
- The new manager is such a dick.

14:43.467 --> 14:44.718
Huge dick.

14:44.801 --> 14:48.013
'kay. Well, Mr. Manager,

14:48.096 --> 14:50.307
aren't you ashamed to be out
on the town alone

14:50.390 --> 14:51.725
with a married woman?

14:53.227 --> 14:55.145
I'm not married.

14:55.229 --> 14:56.605
- So...
- You practically are.

14:56.688 --> 14:59.399
That's what I was going
to tell you.

15:00.150 --> 15:02.027
I'm in a relationship.

15:03.612 --> 15:04.947
No, I'm not even kidding.

15:05.030 --> 15:06.907
There's an entire sub culture
of men

15:06.990 --> 15:08.659
who only date dolls.

15:08.742 --> 15:09.993
- Ew!
- I know.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.620
I do not understand that.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.373
No doll at home
for you then, David?

15:14.456 --> 15:17.209
- No.
- What about a Mrs. Pallini?

15:17.292 --> 15:20.128
She up late drinking chardonnay
waiting for you?

15:21.088 --> 15:23.966
No, no. There was,
but not anymore.

15:24.049 --> 15:26.468
But I'm sure wherever
she is now, she's drinking.

15:27.261 --> 15:28.720
Well, good for her.

15:28.804 --> 15:30.430
- Cheers.
- Cheers to that.

15:40.482 --> 15:42.818
Come on,
keep your back straight.

15:43.235 --> 15:46.113
Nice. Four more.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.448
Eleven, come on, push.

15:48.532 --> 15:50.409
You got five more in you.

15:51.201 --> 15:52.661
Come on.

16:28.906 --> 16:30.115
You really don't have to walk
me home.

16:30.199 --> 16:31.241
I know.

16:31.325 --> 16:32.659
I do it all the time.

16:32.743 --> 16:33.827
I'm sure you do.

16:38.749 --> 16:40.125
David!

16:41.668 --> 16:44.004
David, don't. Give it to me.
What are you writing?

16:55.516 --> 16:56.558
Not funny.

16:56.642 --> 16:58.644
Tell me about
your young Adonis.

17:00.395 --> 17:02.397
He's an urban planner.

17:03.649 --> 17:06.401
I don't know he's between
jobs right now.

17:06.484 --> 17:09.655
He keeps getting these contracts
that are six months or a year,

17:09.738 --> 17:11.156
and nothing permanent.

17:11.990 --> 17:14.660
- So he's letting you carry him?
- No.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.869
No, we're committed
to each other.

17:17.287 --> 17:18.747
Sounds like a pretty sweet deal
to me.

17:18.829 --> 17:22.166
Yeah, you're going to have
to be nicer to me

17:22.251 --> 17:23.794
if you want me to stick around.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.378
You don't want me
to be not nice.

17:31.552 --> 17:33.637
Tom's waiting for me.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.639
I'll see you at work.

17:59.997 --> 18:00.998
Hey.

18:04.459 --> 18:06.420
How's the city hall going?

18:11.550 --> 18:12.968
What's going on?

18:14.344 --> 18:18.015
Just wasting my life in front
of a computer.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.641
- How are the girls?
- They're fine.

18:25.063 --> 18:27.816
What's wrong?

18:29.359 --> 18:31.403
I lied earlier

18:32.279 --> 18:34.281
about the job then.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.326
I got an email from the city
I didn't get it.

18:37.409 --> 18:39.870
I thought you were so perfect
for that one.

18:39.953 --> 18:42.080
I'm sorry. I just thought
with your background

18:42.164 --> 18:44.791
on the transit city strategy,
they'd hire you for sure.

18:44.875 --> 18:47.002
- Well, they didn't.
- They're crazy not to hire you.

18:47.085 --> 18:49.338
What are they thinking? I don't
understand how the city works.

18:49.421 --> 18:53.550
Like, they fill these desks
with dull, bureaucratic yes men.

18:53.634 --> 18:56.970
While the city is literally
falling apart.

18:57.054 --> 18:58.222
You're starting to rant.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.224
It just makes me so fucking mad.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.309
Like, look at you.
You're so smart,

19:02.392 --> 19:07.147
and adorable, and loyal,
and funny, and-

19:09.691 --> 19:11.026
We should get married.

19:13.779 --> 19:16.281
You don't want to.

19:17.157 --> 19:19.952
No, no, that's not it at all.

19:20.035 --> 19:22.871
I was actually going to ask
you once I got a job.

19:22.955 --> 19:24.206
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:24.957 --> 19:27.251
I can't imagine being
with anyone else.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.044
Me neither.

19:37.636 --> 19:39.179
So when should we do it?

19:39.763 --> 19:41.557
I don't know.

19:42.266 --> 19:44.309
I hadn't thought that far
ahead, really.

19:45.769 --> 19:48.105
- I love you so much.
- I love you too.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.318
- What do we do now?
- I don't know.

19:53.402 --> 19:56.029
I think traditionally we're just
supposed to kiss for a bit.

19:56.113 --> 19:57.406
- Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.971
- You cooked.
- Yeah.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.682
- I didn't burn anything.
- It looks great.

20:23.765 --> 20:24.766
Yum.

20:25.893 --> 20:27.853
- Sausage.
- Sleep okay?

20:31.773 --> 20:32.983
No, I have sausage mouth.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.985
No, no, it's okay.
I love sausage mouth.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.283
Wants some eggs
with that sausage.

20:41.366 --> 20:43.577
No, no, I don't want eggs.
I don't want it.

20:55.964 --> 20:57.257
What happened
last night?

20:57.341 --> 20:58.592
Nothing.

20:58.675 --> 21:00.636
After you left with David,
what happened?

21:02.095 --> 21:05.349
Okay, I am going to tell
you something,

21:05.766 --> 21:07.935
but you can't tell anyone, okay?

21:08.018 --> 21:10.646
If you slept with the only
single straight man

21:10.729 --> 21:13.398
in this entire office,
I swear to god-

21:13.482 --> 21:15.817
Okay, first of all,
that is really gross,

21:15.901 --> 21:17.528
'cause he's, like, 20 years
older than me.

21:17.611 --> 21:19.905
And second of all, I have Tom.

21:20.739 --> 21:22.074
Okay, I wouldn't for sure say
that it's gross,

21:22.157 --> 21:23.742
'cause I would for sure
hit that.

21:24.326 --> 21:26.453
Okay, well, congratulations,
now you can,

21:26.537 --> 21:29.414
because Tom asked me
to marry him.

21:30.290 --> 21:31.583
- What?
- Yeah.

21:32.584 --> 21:35.379
- Show me the ring.
- There's not ring yet.

21:35.462 --> 21:38.966
I don't know, he got down on one
knee out of the blue last night,

21:39.049 --> 21:41.051
and asked me, and-

21:41.134 --> 21:43.011
- Wow.
- I know. It's crazy.

21:43.595 --> 21:46.431
But, listen. You really
can't tell anyone yet, though.

21:47.015 --> 21:48.809
Okay. I won't.

21:48.892 --> 21:49.893
Okay.

21:57.067 --> 21:59.653
Why are you smiling?
That was terrible.

21:59.736 --> 22:03.073
Okay, well, I'm a bit
distracted today.

22:03.156 --> 22:04.658
Got engaged last night.

22:05.158 --> 22:07.828
Whoa, congratulations, man.
That's huge.

22:07.911 --> 22:09.663
- Thank you, thanks.
- That's big.

22:09.746 --> 22:11.582
Still got to squat, though.

22:11.665 --> 22:13.458
- Yeah.
- Here, one last set.

22:14.042 --> 22:16.628
This time I want you to walk
that core out, and push.

22:17.838 --> 22:18.839
Watch.

22:21.049 --> 22:22.843
- See? Give it another go.
- Cool.

22:22.926 --> 22:23.927
Okay.

22:30.142 --> 22:31.894
- You're grinning.
- I'm sorry.

22:31.977 --> 22:33.770
Stick your butt out.

22:34.771 --> 22:35.772
Good.

23:18.982 --> 23:21.026
- Hi.
- Teacher, I think I might need

23:21.109 --> 23:23.654
help with my homework.

23:24.196 --> 23:28.450
Yeah, okay...

23:30.077 --> 23:31.995
- What's wrong?
- I just-

23:32.746 --> 23:34.248
I don't know exactly what to do.

23:35.415 --> 23:38.627
Sure you do. Grown-ups always
know what to do.

24:10.701 --> 24:12.202
Fuck me.

24:21.128 --> 24:22.254
Hold on.

24:27.134 --> 24:29.845
Sorry. Can we just-
Can we come back?

24:29.928 --> 24:31.513
Okay, yeah.

24:32.681 --> 24:34.433
- Are you done?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm done.

24:34.516 --> 24:35.517
There.

24:45.611 --> 24:47.154
Pull my hair.

24:47.237 --> 24:48.363
- Yeah.
- Hair?

25:01.168 --> 25:02.461
Alright, I'm coming.

25:02.544 --> 25:05.506
Okay, hold on. Hold on,
hold on, here.

25:09.426 --> 25:10.427
Cum on my face.

25:11.803 --> 25:13.388
- You sure?
- Yeah.

25:18.810 --> 25:19.811
Do it.

25:21.522 --> 25:23.065
I'm sorry.

25:23.482 --> 25:25.359
Sorry, but I don't know
if I can.

25:25.442 --> 25:26.485
What's wrong?

25:26.568 --> 25:29.071
I just- I don't know. I can't.

25:29.988 --> 25:31.532
- Sorry.
- Aw.

25:31.615 --> 25:33.283
I bet you'd like it.

25:33.367 --> 25:37.162
Yeah, I do, I do, I like it,
it's just-

25:38.372 --> 25:40.332
Yeah, I don't know.
I just didn't want to kill you,

25:40.415 --> 25:41.667
or something.

25:41.750 --> 25:45.295
Well, that's kind
of the point, right?

25:45.379 --> 25:47.339
Yeah, yeah.

25:49.132 --> 25:50.926
We don't have to do
it if you don't want to.

25:55.556 --> 25:56.890
Do you want me to go down
on you?

25:59.017 --> 26:01.687
- Maybe in a little bit.
- Okay.

27:18.430 --> 27:19.640
- Hi.
- Hey.

27:19.723 --> 27:20.933
Can you make sure these go
out today?

27:21.016 --> 27:22.267
- For sure, yeah.
- Thank you.

27:22.351 --> 27:23.435
Your welcome.

27:28.398 --> 27:30.400
Good afternoon, Module 45.

27:31.944 --> 27:36.573
Sure, if you email Module-

27:36.657 --> 27:40.744
If you email memberships
at module45.com,

27:40.827 --> 27:44.414
then we'll get back to you
within 24 hours.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.166
Thanks, bye.

27:48.335 --> 27:50.671
Why don't you introduce
yourself when people call?

27:50.754 --> 27:53.382
Because they're not calling
to learn my name.

27:53.465 --> 27:54.633
Sounds impersonal.

27:55.884 --> 27:59.263
Okay, well then I will introduce
myself from now on.

27:59.346 --> 28:00.848
How about that?

28:00.931 --> 28:03.934
How about making decisions
that demonstrate your value

28:04.017 --> 28:06.019
to the people around you?

28:12.651 --> 28:14.069
Follow me.

28:22.744 --> 28:23.745
Davie?

28:34.214 --> 28:35.757
Close the door.

28:42.139 --> 28:43.557
Lock it.

28:52.691 --> 28:54.109
Come here.

29:02.743 --> 29:04.745
You made a bad learner.

29:05.954 --> 29:07.956
When we were at the conference
together.

29:08.624 --> 29:10.334
You know how to behave.

29:14.588 --> 29:16.298
Do you remember how to behave?

29:26.517 --> 29:27.518
Down.

29:37.069 --> 29:39.571
Good. Very nice.

29:39.655 --> 29:41.823
One two, one two.

29:41.907 --> 29:43.742
One two, keep the hand up.
One, two.

29:48.413 --> 29:49.414
Hey.

29:49.915 --> 29:51.625
Hey beautiful.

29:53.418 --> 29:54.711
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:54.795 --> 29:57.840
David, this is my guy, Tom.

29:57.923 --> 29:59.800
Hey. I'm her guy.

29:59.883 --> 30:01.343
- Good to meet you.
- Yeah.

30:02.094 --> 30:03.345
I hear you're bit of a gym rat.

30:03.428 --> 30:07.015
Yeah. You know,
gotta get big.

30:08.684 --> 30:11.061
- Where do you work out?
- At the boxing gym nearby.

30:11.144 --> 30:12.604
Yeah. I used to go there.

30:12.688 --> 30:14.731
I won a few professional
championships back in the day.

30:14.815 --> 30:16.483
I didn't make it
into the nationals, but-

30:16.567 --> 30:17.985
- Wow.
- Cool, yeah.

30:18.068 --> 30:20.320
You should show me some moves
someday, or something.

30:20.404 --> 30:21.947
I think I might be in a
different weight class.

30:22.030 --> 30:23.991
Yeah. Right now
I'm not sparring yet.

30:24.533 --> 30:26.910
Well, if you're not sparring,
you're not boxing.

30:28.036 --> 30:30.998
Yeah. Yeah, that's fair.

30:37.004 --> 30:39.214
So that's the guy they hired
instead of you, huh?

30:39.298 --> 30:40.299
Yep.

30:40.382 --> 30:42.009
Is he like that all the time?

30:42.092 --> 30:43.802
Kind of, yep.

30:44.511 --> 30:45.846
I'm so sorry.

31:32.267 --> 31:34.520
I don't know why
he does this.

31:34.603 --> 31:37.231
Your dad's texting me
from the pub for updates.

31:37.314 --> 31:38.774
What's he saying?

31:38.857 --> 31:40.901
He wants to know if there will
be any 'real food'.

31:40.984 --> 31:42.444
That's his words.

31:42.528 --> 31:44.071
Why didn't he just stay
and help?

31:44.154 --> 31:45.405
He's trying to give me space.

31:45.489 --> 31:47.115
So, why is he texting you then?

31:47.199 --> 31:48.825
Because he likes to torture me.

31:49.576 --> 31:51.912
Lauren and Tom are just like
you guys.

31:52.579 --> 31:54.957
No, we're not. Anyways,

31:55.040 --> 31:56.959
so I think this is doable.

31:57.042 --> 31:59.795
Tom's family isn't coming to
town until the wedding anyway,

31:59.878 --> 32:02.631
so we're going to have about 30
people at the engagement party.

32:02.714 --> 32:03.799
I think that's going to be fine.

32:03.882 --> 32:05.717
I mean, it's just going
to be intimate.

32:05.801 --> 32:09.054
I don't know. I'm worried
that we don't have a wow factor.

32:09.137 --> 32:10.848
- You know, do we need a theme?
- No.

32:10.931 --> 32:12.975
I feel like if you're just
trying to impress people,

32:13.058 --> 32:14.393
it just comes off
as being forced.

32:14.476 --> 32:15.894
Yeah, that's true.

32:15.978 --> 32:17.437
Okay, so tasks.

32:17.521 --> 32:18.856
Does everyone know
what they have to do?

32:18.939 --> 32:19.940
We've only got three weeks.

32:20.023 --> 32:21.358
- Yeah, yeah.
- Knock, knock.

32:21.441 --> 32:23.151
- Hello, ladies.
- Hey.

32:23.235 --> 32:24.945
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi.

32:25.612 --> 32:27.239
Well, this looks great.
Hard at work.

32:27.322 --> 32:30.659
Yeah. You know, I've gotten
a little carried away, but-

32:30.742 --> 32:32.452
Macaron, croquembouche.

32:32.536 --> 32:34.496
Am I seeing a theme?

32:34.580 --> 32:38.208
Hey, this is serious bridesmaid
business. No interference.

32:38.292 --> 32:41.128
Yeah, you just open up that
wallet and leave the rest to us.

32:41.795 --> 32:43.797
Well, truth be told,
his wallet's a little

32:43.881 --> 32:45.883
on the light side these days.

32:45.966 --> 32:48.552
- Lauren.
- It's true.

32:51.138 --> 32:52.890
So we should probably
get going.

32:52.973 --> 32:55.642
You need to get to the store
before it closes.

32:55.726 --> 32:58.103
Thank you so much, Mom.
I really, really appreciate it.

32:58.187 --> 33:00.480
You guys know what you have
to do, yes?

33:00.564 --> 33:02.149
Okay, amazing. Thank you!

33:02.232 --> 33:04.610
- Bye.
- Okay, I'll see you soon, bye.

33:33.013 --> 33:34.181
Do you want some water?

33:35.182 --> 33:36.183
No.

33:41.522 --> 33:42.856
Are you okay?

33:44.858 --> 33:47.694
Are you feeling sick, or-

33:49.029 --> 33:50.656
I don't want to talk about it.

33:56.620 --> 33:58.997
No word on any of the jobs
I guess, huh?

34:00.374 --> 34:02.000
Yeah, I just need to sleep.

34:05.003 --> 34:07.089
Are you mad about the party?

34:08.422 --> 34:09.632
It's fine.

34:10.467 --> 34:11.802
I'm sorry.

34:14.638 --> 34:16.389
Yeah, I just need to sleep
I think.

34:17.975 --> 34:20.226
- You can sleep after.
- Lauren.

34:49.005 --> 34:51.842
Your model is looking good.

34:52.801 --> 34:56.013
Are you going to do the arches
on the square?

34:56.889 --> 34:58.348
I don't know yet.

34:59.474 --> 35:00.809
Where are you going?

35:01.393 --> 35:02.728
What do you mean?

35:03.312 --> 35:06.481
- I don't know. It's Saturday.
- Yeah.

35:06.565 --> 35:08.692
Unemployed people
don't get weekends.

35:09.776 --> 35:11.778
So you're going to the gym?

35:11.862 --> 35:14.990
Yeah, go to the gym,
write some cover letters.

35:15.490 --> 35:18.202
Fine. Well, have fun.

35:18.285 --> 35:19.286
Thanks.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.680
So you're a student, you said?

35:39.139 --> 35:40.140
Yes.

35:41.099 --> 35:43.185
- Engineering.
- Hey, no kidding.

35:43.268 --> 35:44.645
My sister's an engineer.

35:45.145 --> 35:47.272
She teaches too.
What year are you in?

35:47.356 --> 35:49.858
- Third.
- Amazing.

35:49.942 --> 35:52.110
I tell ya, I couldn't teach
you to tie your own shoe laces,

35:52.194 --> 35:53.362
let alone engineering.

35:55.072 --> 35:56.365
Anyway, this is it.

35:56.448 --> 35:57.699
As you can see,
it's pretty terrific.

35:57.783 --> 36:00.702
Really clean, and I just put
some new tile in.

36:00.786 --> 36:03.539
Quiet neighbors upstairs,
nice and bright.

36:03.622 --> 36:05.582
Yeah, no, it looks perfect.

36:05.666 --> 36:07.584
- I'm just gonna-
- Yeah, yeah.

36:09.211 --> 36:10.546
Great water pressure.

36:11.505 --> 36:13.131
Yeah, and I mean, it's a steal.

36:13.715 --> 36:15.467
- How much was it again?
- It's 1150.

36:16.260 --> 36:18.846
Which is amazing, you know,
for this neighborhood.

36:19.346 --> 36:20.556
Yeah, for sure.

36:20.639 --> 36:23.642
Well, yeah. I'd love to take
an application.

36:23.725 --> 36:25.102
Sure, I'll just grab one
from the car.

36:25.185 --> 36:26.562
Take another minute
to look around.

36:26.645 --> 36:28.146
- Thank you.
- No problem.

36:50.627 --> 36:51.628
Hey.

36:52.212 --> 36:53.213
Hey.

36:55.591 --> 36:57.009
Have you eaten yet?

36:57.634 --> 36:58.635
No.

36:59.386 --> 37:00.554
Are you okay?

37:01.722 --> 37:03.307
Yeah, just my tummy
is a bit off.

37:10.439 --> 37:12.107
Well, I bought some fresh ginger
the other day.

37:12.191 --> 37:13.775
I can make you a ginger
mint tea.

37:14.985 --> 37:16.445
And acetaminophen?

37:16.945 --> 37:18.238
You take that for everything.

37:18.322 --> 37:19.823
It's not even going to make
you feel better.

37:19.907 --> 37:20.908
Please?

37:21.992 --> 37:24.077
Okay, fine. But I'm making
you ginger mint tea.

37:24.161 --> 37:25.162
Okay.

37:26.455 --> 37:28.248
- Thank you.
- Your welcome.

37:33.253 --> 37:35.881
See? There's barely
anything left.

37:45.557 --> 37:46.558
Tom?

37:49.811 --> 37:52.356
- Where did you get this?
- Don't worry about it.

37:53.148 --> 37:54.149
But how did you pay for this?

37:54.233 --> 37:56.109
I had a new card in the mail.

37:56.193 --> 37:58.529
- You put it on credit?
- Which one's your left hand?

37:59.154 --> 38:00.656
No, I think it goes on my right.

38:00.739 --> 38:02.241
No, no, it's the left hand.
Lift it up.

38:02.324 --> 38:03.325
Okay.

38:07.454 --> 38:08.705
Thank you.

38:10.249 --> 38:12.543
See, I knew you'd be worried
about the price of the rings,

38:12.626 --> 38:16.672
so I decided to get cheap
champagne to celebrate.

38:16.755 --> 38:18.841
Do men get engagement rings too?
Is that-

38:18.924 --> 38:20.884
- Is that a thing?
- I don't think so,

38:20.968 --> 38:23.637
but now I definitely want one.

38:24.638 --> 38:26.265
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah.

38:32.646 --> 38:33.647
Sorry.

38:34.398 --> 38:36.275
I was shaking it up
with the left hand.

39:17.274 --> 39:18.901
Come over to my place tonight.

39:18.984 --> 39:22.321
You want to fuck me twice
in one day? That could be fun.

39:22.404 --> 39:25.490
No, I want to make you dinner,
then fuck you twice in one day.

39:27.284 --> 39:30.120
I don't think I can.

39:30.871 --> 39:33.040
We can still have fun
now, though.

39:34.082 --> 39:35.834
I can get sex anywhere.

39:37.085 --> 39:38.420
But I like you.

39:48.472 --> 39:50.891
Okay, I have to go.
I have to go.

39:52.184 --> 39:53.519
I have to go.

40:34.893 --> 40:36.270
Hey, babe.

40:37.104 --> 40:38.105
Hey.

40:38.689 --> 40:39.731
Smells good in here.

40:39.815 --> 40:41.692
Yeah, got South Indian
Dosa Mahal.

40:41.775 --> 40:46.154
Did you save me
some pakoras?

40:46.613 --> 40:48.949
Of course I did. I got it all.
There's tons of food.

40:49.032 --> 40:50.993
- Come join with me.
- Great. You're the best.

40:52.286 --> 40:53.912
I'm just going to get
a quick shower

40:53.996 --> 40:54.997
before I sit down with you.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.331
I just have been running
around all day.

40:56.415 --> 40:57.958
I feel really sweaty, okay?

40:58.041 --> 40:59.168
Yeah, okay.

41:12.389 --> 41:14.266
Don't be scared.

41:14.892 --> 41:16.476
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:17.853 --> 41:19.229
How's my girl?

41:19.646 --> 41:21.190
- Good.
- Yeah?

41:21.273 --> 41:22.274
Yeah.

41:23.650 --> 41:25.319
When am I going to get mine?

41:26.361 --> 41:27.863
It's coming.
Don't you worry.

41:27.946 --> 41:29.156
Yeah? Going to be big?

41:29.239 --> 41:30.657
It's gonna be so big.

41:47.674 --> 41:49.426
You're sure quiet today.

41:50.719 --> 41:52.971
I think somebody's getting
cold feet.

41:53.430 --> 41:54.431
As if.

41:54.515 --> 41:56.975
Well, there's nothing wrong
with changing your mind.

41:57.726 --> 42:00.020
Who said I'm changing my mind?
I'm just-

42:00.103 --> 42:02.314
Well, see? They're perfect
for each other.

42:06.485 --> 42:07.486
Hello?

42:10.030 --> 42:12.908
Hi, yes. Just one second.

42:16.703 --> 42:19.540
Hi, yeah, sorry about that.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.001
Really?

42:27.005 --> 42:31.552
Yeah. No, I'm fine. That's-

42:32.177 --> 42:34.805
That's great. That's great
news, yeah.

42:35.514 --> 42:36.849
It's a great apartment.

42:38.350 --> 42:40.102
Yeah, thank you.

42:41.645 --> 42:42.896
Okay, bye.

43:10.674 --> 43:12.176
- Laura, hi.
- Hi.

43:13.886 --> 43:15.220
Come on in.

43:19.850 --> 43:21.560
Sorry, it's a bit messy.

43:21.643 --> 43:25.230
It's fine. It's, it's nice.

43:25.314 --> 43:27.232
- Can I get you anything?
- Sure.

43:27.316 --> 43:29.943
Do you have any whiskey?

43:30.360 --> 43:32.988
Yeah, yeah.

43:45.417 --> 43:47.294
You got engaged.

43:52.674 --> 43:54.551
It's not serious.

44:00.849 --> 44:02.935
How can a promise to spend
the rest of your life

44:03.018 --> 44:04.561
with someone not be serious?

44:17.950 --> 44:20.869
- Do you want me to go?
- No, what do you want?

44:22.621 --> 44:23.997
I don't know.

44:25.415 --> 44:26.834
I don't know.

44:31.922 --> 44:33.549
I think I know what you want.

44:36.844 --> 44:38.345
Take your clothes off.

45:01.785 --> 45:03.120
All of it.

45:38.447 --> 45:40.199
Can I get you some water?

45:41.200 --> 45:42.201
Sure.

46:12.731 --> 46:15.234
Can you bring me
my clothes, please?

46:15.317 --> 46:16.318
Yeah.

46:23.033 --> 46:26.119
Hey, Nicky. Hi, yeah.

46:26.203 --> 46:28.747
Sorry, I, took off
like that.

46:28.830 --> 46:32.668
I just, I went to the park
to get some air and then

46:32.751 --> 46:34.461
I lost track of time.

46:34.545 --> 46:37.631
It was so funny running into
Tom at the office the other day.

46:37.714 --> 46:39.466
He looked pretty much just
how I pictured him.

46:39.550 --> 46:41.844
No, Nicky,
that wasn't David.

46:42.511 --> 46:44.429
That doesn't make any sense.

46:44.513 --> 46:46.014
I'll call you back
in a bit, okay?

46:47.975 --> 46:48.976
Fuck!

46:54.523 --> 46:55.691
I have to go.

46:55.774 --> 46:57.693
It was bound to happen
at some point.

46:58.652 --> 46:59.653
David.

47:01.321 --> 47:03.407
Some people are just meant
to be together.

47:57.669 --> 48:00.547
Hey, you coming to bed?

48:19.525 --> 48:20.526
Hi.

48:21.151 --> 48:23.403
I didn't think anyone else
would be in this early.

48:29.910 --> 48:32.120
So I texted you 18 times
last night.

48:32.996 --> 48:34.873
I know. I'm sorry.

48:35.499 --> 48:37.876
Guess you're sleeping
with your gross boss, huh?

48:38.961 --> 48:41.672
You didn't think he was gross,
like a week ago.

48:43.590 --> 48:44.591
Nikki.

48:46.677 --> 48:47.678
What?

48:48.804 --> 48:51.014
We met before I met Tom, okay?

48:51.098 --> 48:52.975
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

48:53.058 --> 48:55.686
It was years ago
at this conference in Seattle.

48:55.769 --> 48:59.147
And it was just this really
short intense time,

48:59.231 --> 49:01.191
and it was over
because he was married.

49:01.650 --> 49:03.527
I never thought he would end
up here.

49:03.610 --> 49:04.778
So what?

49:05.737 --> 49:07.030
You're getting married.

49:07.114 --> 49:09.032
Have a little bit
of self-control.

49:09.116 --> 49:10.325
Please don't judge me, okay?

49:10.409 --> 49:13.620
I am a person who loves you,
so just talk to me.

49:19.251 --> 49:22.045
Okay...

49:22.588 --> 49:23.964
So this is it?

49:24.047 --> 49:27.634
Like, I'm going to be
David's secretary

49:27.718 --> 49:28.927
for the rest of my life?

49:29.011 --> 49:32.931
Like, married to Tom
until we get bored,

49:33.015 --> 49:36.101
and decide that we want
a divorce?

49:36.894 --> 49:38.770
Like that's what my life's going
to be?

49:39.730 --> 49:41.190
Can I do better?

49:41.732 --> 49:44.568
Better than what? Better how?

49:44.651 --> 49:46.111
Well, just better.

49:48.280 --> 49:49.781
I'm going to go back to work.

50:09.885 --> 50:10.886
Lauren.

50:11.470 --> 50:13.305
What are you doing out here
without a coat?

50:13.805 --> 50:15.432
I just needed some air.

50:15.516 --> 50:16.934
Hey, I have a great idea.

50:17.017 --> 50:19.394
Why don't we go away to Niagara
this weekend?

50:22.564 --> 50:23.815
Think about it.

50:25.359 --> 50:30.072
Why don't you meet me
in the storage room in 15?

50:30.155 --> 50:31.156
Okay.

50:32.115 --> 50:33.951
- Everything alright?
- Yeah.

50:36.203 --> 50:37.704
Don't catch a cold.

50:53.345 --> 50:54.346
Hey.

51:01.103 --> 51:02.563
What's wrong?

51:06.275 --> 51:08.527
I'm sorry.
I can't do this anymore.

51:18.829 --> 51:21.748
Please don't make me chase
you anymore.

51:21.832 --> 51:22.833
David.

51:24.168 --> 51:25.961
- I'm getting married.
- No you're not.

51:27.921 --> 51:29.965
You're smarter than that.

51:32.593 --> 51:34.094
It's what I want.

51:35.888 --> 51:38.015
You don't know what you want.

52:32.486 --> 52:34.821
Lauren, is this a new draft?

53:14.987 --> 53:15.988
Hey.

53:16.697 --> 53:19.616
Guess what? I know this is going
to sound crazy,

53:19.700 --> 53:22.286
but I quit my job today.

53:24.496 --> 53:26.748
What? What's wrong?

53:27.291 --> 53:28.667
Are you sleeping with David?

53:31.170 --> 53:33.088
He texted me like a half
hour ago.

53:34.798 --> 53:36.216
Well, he's lying.

53:36.717 --> 53:39.136
He sent me a picture of you
in that school girl's outfit.

53:44.266 --> 53:45.267
I-

53:47.394 --> 53:49.104
What's that?

53:49.188 --> 53:50.814
Don't stop. If there's an
explanation for this,

53:50.898 --> 53:52.149
I'd love to hear it.

53:54.359 --> 53:56.820
We met years ago
at a conference.

53:56.904 --> 53:59.281
- Okay.
- And I'm sorry

53:59.364 --> 54:01.158
I didn't tell
you about it before.

54:02.492 --> 54:03.493
Tom.

54:06.538 --> 54:09.291
- Tom, I'm really sorry.
- No, don't be.

54:09.374 --> 54:10.584
You upgraded.

54:12.002 --> 54:14.171
I told him that it was over.

54:14.922 --> 54:17.090
I'm sorry. I don't know
what I was thinking.

54:17.174 --> 54:18.926
I know exactly
what you were thinking.

54:19.009 --> 54:20.552
Can we just talk about this?

54:23.013 --> 54:24.014
Please?

55:02.427 --> 55:05.556
Hey, the little buddy.
What's up?

55:05.639 --> 55:07.683
- This guy is getting married.
- I want to spar.

55:08.100 --> 55:09.434
We're getting there, man.

55:09.518 --> 55:11.812
- I'm not going to fight you.
- I want to do it tonight.

55:11.895 --> 55:13.647
- I'm ready right now.
- Have you been drinking?

55:13.730 --> 55:15.399
Well, if a fight started,
you couldn't stop it.

55:15.482 --> 55:16.733
- I can stop it.
- Yeah?

55:16.817 --> 55:18.735
Let's just sit down and-

55:23.699 --> 55:24.867
Go home, Tom.

55:32.291 --> 55:34.960
I'm not going to help you back
up if you try to punch me again.

55:40.632 --> 55:45.637
Okay, so we'll just get you
to sign here and here.

55:45.721 --> 55:46.722
Okay.

55:50.350 --> 55:52.227
Everything okay?

55:52.311 --> 55:54.229
Yes. Perfect.

56:00.402 --> 56:01.403
Great.

56:04.573 --> 56:07.576
I'm actually not feeling
very well. Can I just use-

56:07.659 --> 56:09.203
- Of course.
- Thank you.

56:45.364 --> 56:46.990
This is Nikki.
If you know me,

56:47.074 --> 56:48.534
you know I don't
check my voicemail.

56:48.617 --> 56:50.536
If you don't know me, then-

57:03.173 --> 57:06.009
I'm just getting a few things.
I'll be just a little bit.

57:06.969 --> 57:09.471
I'm just-Stay as long
as you need to.

57:11.306 --> 57:13.016
What happened to your face?

57:13.100 --> 57:14.518
I got in a fight.

57:15.227 --> 57:16.228
Where?

57:18.730 --> 57:21.483
Sorry, it just seems really
unlike you.

57:22.150 --> 57:24.862
Yeah, well, maybe this is what
I'm like now.

57:35.372 --> 57:37.124
I got you scotch and macaron.

57:38.500 --> 57:40.502
You can't gift your way out
of this.

57:41.670 --> 57:44.923
Okay, I'm just going to make
you a drink.

57:45.007 --> 57:47.801
No, Lauren. Can you please just
cut that shit out?

57:52.639 --> 57:53.640
Okay.

58:03.150 --> 58:08.530
So I'm pregnant.

58:09.531 --> 58:10.991
I don't believe you.

58:13.368 --> 58:15.037
Okay...

58:24.129 --> 58:25.130
Here.

58:26.507 --> 58:28.634
What? What does that prove?

58:28.717 --> 58:30.636
Well, there-

58:30.719 --> 58:32.638
Why would I ever believe
anything that came out

58:32.721 --> 58:34.056
of your mouth ever again?

58:34.640 --> 58:36.016
Tom, I wouldn't lie.

58:36.099 --> 58:37.309
Well, do you have anymore
of those?

58:37.392 --> 58:38.727
- Tests?
- Yes, tests.

58:38.810 --> 58:40.270
- Yeah, like, one.
- Great, where?

58:40.354 --> 58:42.189
- In the bathroom.
- Perfect.

58:43.106 --> 58:44.107
Tom.

58:46.985 --> 58:48.070
What, you want me to-

58:48.153 --> 58:49.446
yes, I want you to piss on one
of those things,

58:49.530 --> 58:51.073
and I want you to show me,

58:52.616 --> 58:53.617
Okay.

59:00.207 --> 59:02.000
You're just going
to stand there?

59:05.963 --> 59:06.964
Okay.

59:21.979 --> 59:24.147
- I can't with you watching me.
- Well.

59:26.483 --> 59:27.484
Fine.

59:39.246 --> 59:40.330
Okay, give it to me.

59:40.414 --> 59:42.958
It's all wet.

01:00:05.856 --> 01:00:06.857
Okay.

01:00:07.816 --> 01:00:08.817
So.

01:00:10.694 --> 01:00:13.572
I mean, you fucked David too,
right? So who knows?

01:00:16.575 --> 01:00:18.118
We always used condoms.

01:00:18.202 --> 01:00:19.870
I was really careful about that.

01:00:19.953 --> 01:00:21.872
Sweet. That's very sweet.

01:00:23.832 --> 01:00:26.418
What about other guys?

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.546
No. It was just him, I promise.

01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:31.048
Said the cheating liar.

01:00:32.341 --> 01:00:33.383
Are you just saying
that 'cause you think

01:00:33.467 --> 01:00:34.468
that's what I want to hear?

01:00:34.551 --> 01:00:37.054
No. It was just him
and it's over.

01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:43.519
- Well, that's...
- Good?

01:00:43.602 --> 01:00:45.103
Yeah, it's good. It's very good.

01:00:45.604 --> 01:00:46.939
Yeah, you just fucked
the one guy,

01:00:47.022 --> 01:00:49.358
but you always used condoms,
so everybody wins.

01:00:55.322 --> 01:00:57.950
What are you going to do?
Are you going to keep it?

01:01:00.285 --> 01:01:02.704
I like the way our life
is right now.

01:01:02.788 --> 01:01:04.331
- Bullshit.
- I do.

01:01:12.089 --> 01:01:13.507
You'd make a good mom.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.343
You take good care of me.

01:01:18.178 --> 01:01:21.390
Well, you like being mothered
a little bit.

01:01:21.473 --> 01:01:23.058
I don't need you to be my mom.

01:01:23.934 --> 01:01:26.854
But you like it when I pack
your lunch,

01:01:26.937 --> 01:01:30.399
or make the bed, or, like,
write you a shopping list.

01:01:30.482 --> 01:01:32.568
You like that. I hate that shit.

01:01:32.651 --> 01:01:35.571
But you ask my opinion about
every little decision.

01:01:35.654 --> 01:01:37.322
Yeah, 'cause I know you want
to be in control of everything.

01:01:37.406 --> 01:01:41.118
- No, I really don't.
- That's such a lie.

01:01:45.497 --> 01:01:47.708
I hate that you have doubts
about us.

01:01:49.209 --> 01:01:50.878
'Cause I never had doubts.

01:01:58.635 --> 01:02:00.429
I hate that I'm pregnant.

01:02:02.139 --> 01:02:03.348
No you don't.

01:02:06.226 --> 01:02:09.897
On our third date,
you were like,

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:11.565
"I want to have two kids. "

01:02:11.648 --> 01:02:14.359
And I remember vividly because
it freaked the shit out of me.

01:02:14.443 --> 01:02:16.236
- What?
- Yeah, you don't remember that?

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:19.448
No, I don't want one.
I never wanted one.

01:02:23.785 --> 01:02:25.954
It's actually kind of a relief.

01:02:40.636 --> 01:02:44.181
So I'll make an appointment
this week.

01:02:59.863 --> 01:03:02.282
So is there anything else
that I don't know?

01:03:10.123 --> 01:03:11.625
I got my own apartment today.

01:03:14.002 --> 01:03:17.130
- What?
- I'm sorry, I-

01:03:17.214 --> 01:03:21.093
How could you just make
that decision without even

01:03:21.176 --> 01:03:22.553
talking to me about it?

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:28.892
I'm sorry, I'm an idiot,
and I was trying to be prepared.

01:03:28.976 --> 01:03:31.144
- Prepare for-
- I don't know.

01:03:31.228 --> 01:03:33.105
So you just have this whole
other thing?

01:03:33.188 --> 01:03:34.773
- No.
- You need to go!

01:03:34.857 --> 01:03:36.567
- Can we talk about this?
- No!

01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:39.570
You have your own apartment.
You can go and enjoy that.

01:03:40.571 --> 01:03:41.947
But, Tom.

01:04:44.134 --> 01:04:45.135
Hello?

01:04:47.012 --> 01:04:49.097
Yes, this is Lauren Frank.

01:04:52.059 --> 01:04:54.228
Yes, I'll be there on Thursday.

01:04:57.814 --> 01:05:00.108
Yep.

01:05:01.026 --> 01:05:05.739
What if no one
can be there to pick me up?

01:05:08.951 --> 01:05:12.412
Okay, can I call a cab?

01:05:14.790 --> 01:05:15.791
Okay.

01:05:16.291 --> 01:05:18.335
Yeah, no, it's okay.
I'll figure it out.

01:05:19.253 --> 01:05:21.588
Thank you. Bye.

01:06:11.763 --> 01:06:13.223
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:06:13.932 --> 01:06:15.767
How did you know I was here?

01:06:15.851 --> 01:06:17.102
Tom told me.

01:06:18.228 --> 01:06:19.813
Can I come in?

01:06:19.897 --> 01:06:21.857
Of course, yeah.

01:06:28.739 --> 01:06:33.744
I know it doesn't look like
much right now, but-

01:06:33.827 --> 01:06:36.872
I'm cleaning and it's cozy.

01:06:36.955 --> 01:06:41.627
Well, I can sweep, or wipe,
or clean the cupboard.

01:06:42.169 --> 01:06:44.755
Don't worry about it.

01:06:44.838 --> 01:06:48.133
I'm almost out of cleaning
stuff anyway.

01:06:48.217 --> 01:06:50.219
But, yeah, have a look around.

01:06:58.227 --> 01:07:00.687
So you and Tom
are finished then?

01:07:03.857 --> 01:07:05.234
Is that what he said to you?

01:07:08.612 --> 01:07:10.822
Well, you sure gave up quick.

01:07:10.906 --> 01:07:13.742
I don't think that's really
what happened.

01:07:13.825 --> 01:07:16.912
Well, better now than 20 years
from now.

01:07:20.749 --> 01:07:23.752
You've never like to change
course midstream.

01:07:24.711 --> 01:07:26.713
Well, maybe you're growing up.

01:08:07.004 --> 01:08:08.005
Hello?

01:08:09.214 --> 01:08:10.340
Hi.

01:08:10.424 --> 01:08:12.259
Look, I know you don't want
to talk to me right now,

01:08:12.342 --> 01:08:15.679
but my appointment at the clinic
is booked for tomorrow.

01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:21.225
Who are you talking to?

01:08:23.645 --> 01:08:25.689
I need someone to pick me up.

01:08:26.732 --> 01:08:28.149
Why don't you call Nikki?

01:08:28.233 --> 01:08:30.484
Yeah. She wants a baby so bad.

01:08:32.904 --> 01:08:34.406
How about your parents?

01:08:35.573 --> 01:08:37.451
I'd really like it to be you.

01:08:40.828 --> 01:08:41.830
Tom?

01:08:47.294 --> 01:08:48.295
Hold on.

01:08:49.796 --> 01:08:50.881
What time?

01:08:51.548 --> 01:08:52.758
4 p. m.

01:08:55.385 --> 01:08:57.304
Got it. I'll meet you there.

01:08:57.386 --> 01:08:58.388
Okay.

01:09:00.182 --> 01:09:01.183
Okay.

01:09:44.184 --> 01:09:45.185
Thanks.

01:09:54.319 --> 01:09:55.821
You okay?

01:09:55.904 --> 01:09:57.614
Yeah. I'm okay.

01:09:59.658 --> 01:10:00.701
How are you?

01:10:04.121 --> 01:10:08.375
Great, so your new place
is on Runcie?

01:10:08.458 --> 01:10:12.129
Yeah, I was actually
wondering if I can

01:10:12.212 --> 01:10:13.797
come home with you for a bit,

01:10:13.881 --> 01:10:16.049
because I don't have a real
bed yet.

01:10:20.721 --> 01:10:22.264
Is that okay?

01:10:22.347 --> 01:10:24.057
Yeah. Yeah, no problem.

01:10:24.850 --> 01:10:25.851
Thanks.

01:10:49.416 --> 01:10:50.959
Are you okay?
Do you want to-

01:10:51.502 --> 01:10:54.588
Is it okay if I go in the-

01:10:54.671 --> 01:10:55.714
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:10:55.797 --> 01:10:57.424
I just think I need to lie down.

01:10:58.967 --> 01:11:00.636
- Here, I'll take that.
- Thank you.

01:11:04.389 --> 01:11:05.390
Thanks.

01:11:11.396 --> 01:11:13.649
Hello? Speaking.

01:11:16.151 --> 01:11:18.403
Yes, okay. Yeah, I know.

01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:26.453
Right. Wow. Okay, yeah.
That sounds great.

01:11:27.788 --> 01:11:32.209
Yeah, of course. I'll talk
to you Monday. No problem.

01:11:59.069 --> 01:12:00.070
Hey.

01:12:28.599 --> 01:12:30.225
Are you-

01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:37.149
Are you having second thoughts
about it?

01:12:39.151 --> 01:12:40.152
No.

01:12:43.822 --> 01:12:45.157
Are you sure?

01:12:46.742 --> 01:12:47.743
Yeah.

01:12:53.248 --> 01:12:54.791
I'm just so sorry.

01:12:57.753 --> 01:13:01.173
I know you have no reason
to believe me, but-

01:13:02.049 --> 01:13:05.260
but I feel sick when I think
about how much I hurt you.

01:13:10.682 --> 01:13:15.020
I want to say that everything's
going to be okay.

01:13:15.729 --> 01:13:18.232
And that we can just sweep
everything under the rug.

01:13:19.024 --> 01:13:21.944
But you're supposed
to be my partner,

01:13:22.027 --> 01:13:25.322
and every decision you made
you made without me.

01:13:26.406 --> 01:13:27.950
I just-

01:13:37.417 --> 01:13:40.921
You're, you're right.

01:13:50.389 --> 01:13:53.517
I know that I'm not supposed
to say this

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:56.562
because it's too late,
but I really miss you.

01:13:56.645 --> 01:13:58.480
Lauren, I-

01:13:58.564 --> 01:14:00.607
I'm sorry. I should go.

01:14:00.691 --> 01:14:04.736
No, no don't, don't.
Please just stay.

01:14:09.199 --> 01:14:11.118
I want you to stay.
