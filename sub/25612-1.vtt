00:47.582 --> 00:49.582
Budapest.

00:49.584 --> 00:51.918
The next stop's Budapest.

00:51.920 --> 00:53.920
Budapest is the next stop.

00:53.922 --> 00:55.921
Budapest.

00:55.923 --> 00:57.624
Tickets, ladies.

00:57.626 --> 00:59.493
Oop, here you go.

00:59.495 --> 01:01.027
- Here's mine.
- And mine.

01:01.029 --> 01:03.189
- Mine, too!
- Here you go!

01:05.034 --> 01:08.335
Thank you, young man.

01:08.337 --> 01:10.070
Man, I hate wearing disguises.

01:10.072 --> 01:12.705
These heels are killing me.

01:12.707 --> 01:14.041
Okay, take it down a notch.

01:14.043 --> 01:15.675
We don't want to alarm
the humans.

01:16.978 --> 01:19.413
Psst. Drac.

01:19.415 --> 01:21.881
I'm about to <i>und</i> freak out!

01:21.883 --> 01:23.719
You're a nice kitty.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.353
I'm <i>und</i> kitty-cat.

01:26.355 --> 01:28.291
Meow. Meow!

01:35.029 --> 01:37.530
Oh, no,
not this clown again.

01:37.532 --> 01:39.933
Good evening, travelers.

01:39.935 --> 01:43.502
I am Professor
Abraham Van Helsing.

01:43.504 --> 01:46.672
Yes. One of the Van Helsings.

01:46.674 --> 01:50.077
For centuries, my family
has protected humanity

01:50.079 --> 01:52.645
from the evils of monsters.

01:52.647 --> 01:54.914
So you can believe me
when I tell you,

01:54.916 --> 01:57.684
there are monsters
hiding amongst you!

01:58.986 --> 02:00.720
But fear not,

02:00.722 --> 02:04.558
for I am a professional,
and I know how to flush out

02:04.560 --> 02:08.562
these beasts
and bring them into the light!

02:08.564 --> 02:10.062
Fire bad!

02:35.823 --> 02:37.025
Whoa!

02:42.797 --> 02:43.930
Sorry, guys.

02:55.476 --> 02:58.044
Finally! First I kill Dracula,

02:58.046 --> 03:01.046
and then
the rest of the monsters!

03:01.048 --> 03:02.883
Why do you keep doing this?

03:02.885 --> 03:05.819
Your dad, your grandfather,
your great-great-granny...

03:05.821 --> 03:07.788
I defeated them all.

03:07.790 --> 03:11.457
When will you Van Helsings ever
learn to let go of the hate?

03:11.459 --> 03:15.161
Never! Because you,
monster, are a...

03:15.163 --> 03:16.997
Eh, squeak, squeak.

03:16.999 --> 03:18.532
What? A mouse?

03:18.534 --> 03:20.833
Ahhh!

03:20.835 --> 03:24.104
You can't run from me,
Prince of Darkness!

03:24.106 --> 03:26.907
I will hunt you
for all eternity!

03:29.077 --> 03:33.747
I swear I will never rest until
I destroy you...

03:33.749 --> 03:34.848
And...

03:34.850 --> 03:36.049
Every...

03:36.051 --> 03:37.217
Other...

03:37.219 --> 03:38.652
Monster... Ow!

03:38.654 --> 03:40.219
If it's the last thing...

03:40.221 --> 03:41.555
I...

03:41.557 --> 03:42.556
Ever...

03:42.558 --> 03:43.859
Do!

03:47.696 --> 03:49.862
Boy, that guy is annoying.

03:49.864 --> 03:51.964
Maybe one day
there will be a place

03:51.966 --> 03:54.767
where monsters can go
to get away from it all,

03:54.769 --> 03:56.169
take a vacation.

03:56.171 --> 03:58.904
Who knows,
maybe even get married.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.542
Wouldn't that be something?

04:36.979 --> 04:38.848
Hmm?

04:45.586 --> 04:47.086
It's okay.

04:47.088 --> 04:49.189
Oh, when is
this thing starting?

04:49.191 --> 04:51.658
Aw, you made them cry,
Wayne.

04:51.660 --> 04:54.227
All except this little one.
Coochie-coochie...

04:54.229 --> 04:56.263
That's Sunny.
She doesn't cry.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.533
She bites.

04:59.535 --> 05:02.102
This is a very special moment, Carl.

05:02.104 --> 05:07.510
Any second, your beautiful bride is
going to walk right down the aisle.

05:09.143 --> 05:11.310
Oh, no, Drac,
she's not coming.

05:11.312 --> 05:13.079
Oh, don't worry.

05:13.081 --> 05:17.751
Mavis is with her. I'm sure
everything is under control.

05:17.753 --> 05:20.287
Mavey, is everything
under control?

05:20.289 --> 05:23.055
Um, yep, just a slight case
of pre-wedding jitters.

05:26.761 --> 05:27.762
Ahhh!

05:34.001 --> 05:35.735
Yep, everything is
fine here.

05:37.105 --> 05:38.939
Please try to relax, Lucy.

05:38.941 --> 05:40.840
I've taken care
of everything.

05:40.842 --> 05:43.776
The wedding
is going to be perfect.

05:43.778 --> 05:45.177
It's not that.

05:45.179 --> 05:48.280
Just, how do I know
I'm doing the right thing?

05:50.919 --> 05:53.119
I know just how you feel.

05:53.121 --> 05:56.322
The day I married Johnny was
the best day of my life,

05:56.324 --> 05:58.124
but I was so nervous.

05:58.126 --> 06:00.026
Not as nervous
as I was.

06:00.028 --> 06:02.829
And you should have seen my dad.
He was a mess.

06:02.831 --> 06:05.665
I wouldn't get out
of my coffin that night.

06:05.667 --> 06:07.667
But he knew
it was meant to be.

06:07.669 --> 06:09.802
It doesn't matter
where you come from

06:09.804 --> 06:11.370
or how different
you are.

06:11.372 --> 06:14.006
A Zing only happens
once in your life,

06:14.008 --> 06:15.641
and you have to
cherish it.

06:17.278 --> 06:19.980
Aw.

06:19.982 --> 06:22.047
You're right! Thank you!

06:22.049 --> 06:24.184
Okay.
All right. Okay.

06:24.186 --> 06:26.088
Oh. Uh... Okay.

06:29.357 --> 06:30.790
I do.

06:32.960 --> 06:33.960
I do.

06:39.934 --> 06:41.401
Do you hear that?

06:41.403 --> 06:42.869
Yes. I thought we
locked him in his room.

06:42.871 --> 06:44.037
We did!

06:44.039 --> 06:46.206
Whoa! Whoa!

06:46.208 --> 06:47.807
Hi, Mom. Hi, Papa.

06:47.809 --> 06:49.108
- Dennis!
- Dennis!

06:49.110 --> 06:51.011
Tinkles was crying,
so we let him out.

06:55.816 --> 06:56.886
Ahhh!

07:00.287 --> 07:02.157
Tinkles, sit!

07:09.398 --> 07:12.232
Ah. Whose idea was it
to let Dennis have a puppy?

07:12.234 --> 07:15.134
Um... Yours?

07:16.371 --> 07:17.673
Right.

07:18.306 --> 07:20.072
Poor Tinkles.

07:20.074 --> 07:22.141
Dennis...

07:22.143 --> 07:24.778
Look, honey,
I know you love Tinkles,

07:24.780 --> 07:26.745
but we're not allowed
to bring our dogs...

07:26.747 --> 07:29.848
Uh... I mean, our pets everywhere.

07:29.850 --> 07:30.850
Okay?

07:30.852 --> 07:32.218
Okay.

07:36.758 --> 07:39.059
<i>DJ Jazzy Johnny in the house.</i>

07:39.061 --> 07:43.129
<i>It's time to welcome the happy
couple, Mr. and Mrs. Prickles!</i>

07:43.131 --> 07:46.102
Aw!

07:48.003 --> 07:49.968
<i>The bride and groom
invite everyone</i>

07:49.970 --> 07:52.204
<i>to join them
on the dance floor.</i>

07:55.876 --> 07:57.143
Care to dance?

08:02.117 --> 08:03.348
Is that her?

08:03.350 --> 08:04.951
Ooh! Watch out now.

08:04.953 --> 08:07.487
She got stitches
in all the right places.

08:07.489 --> 08:10.824
Okay, there's no way that
is related to you, Frank.

08:10.826 --> 08:12.492
No, she's
my right arm's cousin.

08:13.929 --> 08:15.829
Ay! Oh!

08:15.831 --> 08:18.331
- Oh!
- Ah! I see it now.

08:18.333 --> 08:20.400
Frank wanted me to meet you.

08:20.402 --> 08:23.939
We're arm cousins,
twice removed.

08:25.407 --> 08:26.872
Of course.

08:26.874 --> 08:30.477
I'd recognize that bicep
anywhere.

08:30.479 --> 08:33.178
He thought, since we're both
single, we might hit it off,

08:33.179 --> 08:34.480
maybe go on a date?

08:34.482 --> 08:36.115
"Date"? Oh!

08:36.116 --> 08:38.453
Well, eh,
it's just that, eh...

08:40.856 --> 08:43.022
Whoa!

08:43.024 --> 08:46.058
The DJ booth
is a sacred space!

08:46.060 --> 08:48.094
I love this song!

08:50.397 --> 08:51.531
Don't you?

08:51.533 --> 08:52.932
Dracula?

08:52.934 --> 08:54.868
Oh, where'd he go?

08:54.870 --> 08:56.802
Dracula?

09:00.107 --> 09:02.008
What's the matter, Drac,
you didn't like her?

09:02.010 --> 09:04.244
No offense, but you
can't be too picky.

09:04.246 --> 09:06.278
You haven't had a date
in 100 years.

09:06.280 --> 09:10.850
Look, guys, I appreciate your
concern, but it's not up to me.

09:10.852 --> 09:14.119
You only Zing once,
and I did.

09:14.121 --> 09:16.054
Times have changed, buddy.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.490
You can even find someone to
Zing with on your phone now.

09:18.492 --> 09:20.293
What? Really?

09:20.295 --> 09:21.927
Oh. Oh, no, no, no.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.897
I'm far too busy.

09:23.899 --> 09:27.801
I have Mavis and Dennis and the
hotel, and bleh, bleh-bleh.

09:27.803 --> 09:30.068
Um, did you guys
hear that?

09:30.070 --> 09:32.071
He actually said,
"Bleh, bleh-bleh."

09:32.073 --> 09:34.143
I don't say,
"Bleh, bleh-bleh"!

09:42.016 --> 09:45.384
Eh, uh,
I'm looking for a Zing.

09:45.386 --> 09:48.288
<i>Okay. Changing phone ring.</i>

09:48.290 --> 09:52.124
No, no.
I'm looking for a date.

09:54.895 --> 09:55.894
No, no, no.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.964
I want to meet someone.

10:00.535 --> 10:02.869
Are you kidding me right now?

10:02.871 --> 10:06.004
Don't you get it?
I want to go on a date!

10:06.006 --> 10:08.541
I'm lonely.

10:10.612 --> 10:13.145
<i>You want baloney.</i>

10:18.953 --> 10:20.887
What? Look at
that hair. Come on.

10:20.889 --> 10:22.488
Ah. Too many eyes.

10:22.490 --> 10:24.224
Too few eyes.

10:24.226 --> 10:25.959
Not into tentacles.

10:25.961 --> 10:27.192
"Match found"?

10:27.194 --> 10:29.028
No, no, no!

10:29.030 --> 10:30.363
<i>First things first.</i>

10:30.365 --> 10:31.431
Whoa!

10:31.433 --> 10:33.365
<i>I'm not into games.</i>

10:33.367 --> 10:35.487
<i>You'd better have a job,
and my cats have to like you.</i>

10:37.539 --> 10:39.071
Oh, no.

10:39.073 --> 10:40.940
Oh, whoa, no.

10:40.942 --> 10:41.941
Dad?

10:41.943 --> 10:43.275
Oh! Mavis! Oh.

10:43.277 --> 10:45.378
Uh, what are you doing here?

10:45.380 --> 10:48.214
I was just checking on the honeymoon
suite, and I heard something.

10:48.216 --> 10:50.316
Oh, I'm sorry,
my little bedbug.

10:50.318 --> 10:52.485
I was just cleaning
the attic.

10:58.025 --> 11:00.125
It's so dirty, ah, yes...

11:00.127 --> 11:02.227
<i>- Who is that?
- Are you on the phone?</i>

11:02.229 --> 11:07.267
What, this? I was just
trying to find a maid

11:07.269 --> 11:09.635
- to help me with the mess.
<i>- A maid?</i>

11:09.637 --> 11:11.137
<i>Who do you think...</i>

11:11.139 --> 11:12.138
Thank you,
I'll check your references

11:12.140 --> 11:13.909
and get back to you. Goodbye!

11:18.045 --> 11:19.144
Dad.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.946
Stop trying to
hide it from me.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.283
Hide? Who?
I mean, what? Me?

11:23.285 --> 11:24.417
Yes.

11:24.419 --> 11:26.385
And I know what it is.

11:26.387 --> 11:28.288
Uh... Really?

11:28.290 --> 11:31.023
You're stressed out
from working too hard.

11:31.025 --> 11:32.325
Oh!

11:32.327 --> 11:33.558
Okay, yes.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.094
You got me.

11:35.096 --> 11:37.230
It's a big hotel,
you know?

11:37.232 --> 11:38.965
Can't get to everything.

11:38.967 --> 11:40.099
But what about you?

11:40.101 --> 11:42.100
You're pretty busy yourself.

11:42.102 --> 11:45.404
I know. It seems like now that
we're working together more,

11:45.406 --> 11:47.974
we're seeing
each other less.

11:47.976 --> 11:50.275
Ah. Yeah.
You're absolutely right.

11:50.277 --> 11:53.211
I am working too much,
you're working too much.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.316
We should really take a break,
starting right now.

11:56.318 --> 11:57.486
Night-night.

12:02.390 --> 12:03.456
<i>I'm still here!</i>

12:16.237 --> 12:17.238
Aw.

12:19.341 --> 12:21.341
Oh! Hey, honey.

12:21.343 --> 12:23.442
You ready for

12:23.444 --> 12:25.211
date night?

12:25.213 --> 12:26.479
Aw.

12:26.481 --> 12:27.679
That's okay, sweetheart.

12:27.681 --> 12:29.148
You rest.

12:32.487 --> 12:34.220
You know, Dad's right.

12:34.222 --> 12:36.022
We need a break.

12:36.024 --> 12:39.091
We need to all be together
again, like a family.

12:39.093 --> 12:40.362
Like we used to.

12:43.397 --> 12:46.132
<i>Are you
overworked and stressed out?</i>

12:46.134 --> 12:48.334
<i>Do you need some family time?</i>

12:48.336 --> 12:50.436
<i>Are you a monster?</i>

12:50.438 --> 12:52.739
<i>Then you need a vacation,</i>

12:52.741 --> 12:55.073
<i>a monster vacation.</i>

12:59.580 --> 13:02.514
Welcome aboard
Gremlin Air.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.755
Ah!

13:19.534 --> 13:21.433
Ladies and gentlemen,

13:21.435 --> 13:23.802
please direct your attention
to the front of the cabin.

13:23.804 --> 13:26.272
For your safety, please
unbuckle your seat belts.

13:26.274 --> 13:27.740
Ooh.

13:31.279 --> 13:33.312
In the likely event we experience
a sudden drop in cabin pressure,

13:33.314 --> 13:35.016
oxygen will be provided.

13:37.385 --> 13:39.317
Can I stow that
for you, sir?

13:39.319 --> 13:40.521
All right. Thanks.

13:42.623 --> 13:45.057
Beverages. Snacks. Beverages.

13:45.059 --> 13:46.793
Beverages. Snacks.

13:46.795 --> 13:48.226
Beverages.

13:51.632 --> 13:53.666
Ahhh!

13:53.668 --> 13:55.768
- Coffee?
- That would be lovely.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.777
Mavis, please,
you're torturing me.

14:04.779 --> 14:07.113
You know I hate surprises.

14:07.115 --> 14:09.448
This is
a fun surprise.

14:09.450 --> 14:11.517
There are no fun surprises.

14:11.519 --> 14:13.351
Just tell me
where we're going.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.821
Why are we on a plane?

14:14.823 --> 14:16.721
We can fly, you know.

14:16.723 --> 14:19.325
Back in my day,
people took trains.

14:19.327 --> 14:20.759
Now, that's classy.

14:20.761 --> 14:23.796
Sure, Dad. Forty hours
in a closet-sized room

14:23.798 --> 14:26.698
with you and Uncle Bernie
and his smelly cigars,

14:26.700 --> 14:28.668
arguing who was
more attractive,

14:28.670 --> 14:30.436
Cleopatra or Nefertiti.

14:30.438 --> 14:32.471
Nefertiti.

14:32.473 --> 14:34.206
Okay, Dad, thank you.

14:34.208 --> 14:37.375
Mavis, this is
such an amazing surprise!

14:37.377 --> 14:41.246
I can't wait to spend time
with the people I love most.

14:41.248 --> 14:45.317
But I beg of you,
tell me where we're going!

14:45.319 --> 14:49.154
Nope. I've taken care of everything,
so you don't need to worry.

14:49.156 --> 14:50.722
You've been
so stressed out lately.

14:50.724 --> 14:53.094
It's time for you to relax.

15:00.735 --> 15:02.902
Now, isn't that better?

15:02.904 --> 15:04.403
Oh, yes.

15:04.405 --> 15:05.741
So relaxed.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.177
I'm gonna go check
on you-know-who.

15:11.179 --> 15:12.778
I'll be right back.

15:12.780 --> 15:15.148
I have to go to the bathroom.

15:15.150 --> 15:16.382
Hey, did you see that?

15:16.384 --> 15:17.917
Dennis went to the bathroom!

15:17.919 --> 15:19.755
Uh... Okay.

15:23.458 --> 15:25.493
Psst. Hey, where are you?

15:30.430 --> 15:32.398
There you are, Tinkles.

15:32.400 --> 15:35.768
Don't worry, we'd never
leave you home alone.

15:35.770 --> 15:36.903
<i>Okay, folks,
you're free to move</i>

15:36.905 --> 15:38.303
about the cabin, as we have

15:38.305 --> 15:39.641
started our descent.

15:54.889 --> 15:57.523
So, any big plans
for the weekend there, Bill?

15:57.525 --> 15:58.890
Oh, you know,
the usual.

15:58.892 --> 16:00.692
Got to take the kids
to soccer.

16:05.199 --> 16:06.365
Snacks. Beverages.

16:06.367 --> 16:08.703
Snacks. Beverages. Snacks.

16:21.248 --> 16:23.983
Ladies and gentlemen, we've
arrived at our destination,

16:23.985 --> 16:25.587
the Bermuda Triangle.

16:37.799 --> 16:39.701
Ooh!

17:15.803 --> 17:18.337
Welcome to
the Bermuda Triangle,

17:18.339 --> 17:22.344
where you'll embark on a
monster cruise of a lifetime.

17:26.513 --> 17:27.912
A cruise?

17:27.914 --> 17:29.782
Surprise!

17:29.784 --> 17:31.417
Oh, no, you... No.

17:31.419 --> 17:35.821
But it's just like a hotel
on the water.

17:35.823 --> 17:37.989
I just figured
you need a vacation

17:37.991 --> 17:40.493
from running
everyone else's vacation.

17:40.495 --> 17:43.329
You've barely been
out of the hotel since...

17:43.331 --> 17:46.398
Well, since Mom died.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.533
But this is a chance
to make new memories,

17:48.535 --> 17:49.834
with all of us.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.037
With Dennis.

17:52.039 --> 17:57.511
- Boat!
- Boat!

18:00.948 --> 18:03.916
Who made you
such an amazing daughter?

18:03.918 --> 18:05.083
You.

18:05.085 --> 18:06.584
That's right!

18:06.586 --> 18:08.553
What a father I am.

18:08.555 --> 18:11.023
Come on, Denisovich,
let's get cruising!

18:11.025 --> 18:12.393
Yay!

18:32.913 --> 18:34.448
Wow!

18:58.939 --> 19:02.073
Okay. Smile.

19:02.075 --> 19:03.609
Thank you.

19:12.754 --> 19:14.055
Ow!

19:15.089 --> 19:16.892
"No pets allowed"?

19:17.859 --> 19:18.860
Uh-oh.

19:28.702 --> 19:29.704
Perfect.

19:35.509 --> 19:37.642
Welcome aboard.
How are you doing?

19:37.644 --> 19:39.043
- Dennis, come on.
- Nice to see you.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.579
Oh, lovely shirt. Yes.

19:40.581 --> 19:43.385
Oh, hello.
Welcome aboard.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.125
Uh, this is Bob.

19:53.127 --> 19:54.726
Say hi, Bob.

19:54.728 --> 19:55.896
"Hi, Bob."

20:03.871 --> 20:05.905
Oh, my gosh, Griffin.

20:05.907 --> 20:07.739
I'm, like, so excited.

20:07.741 --> 20:10.008
This is, like, the nicest
hotel I've ever been to.

20:10.010 --> 20:11.610
Yeah!

20:11.612 --> 20:13.212
Man, this is amazing!

20:13.214 --> 20:14.813
There's so much to do!

20:14.815 --> 20:16.817
Olympic-size swimming pool...

20:17.985 --> 20:19.654
<i>All-you-can-eat buffet...</i>

20:23.090 --> 20:25.690
<i>Full-service spa...</i>

20:25.692 --> 20:28.526
Whoo! I'm gonna get me
a seaweed rewrap!

20:28.528 --> 20:31.530
Wow, it sounds like
everything we can do

20:31.532 --> 20:32.997
at our hotel!

20:32.999 --> 20:35.700
Except on the water!

20:46.581 --> 20:49.782
Ooh! Ah!

20:49.784 --> 20:51.716
Wow!

20:51.718 --> 20:52.885
You nailed it, honey.

20:52.887 --> 20:55.119
Your dad is going to
love this!

20:55.121 --> 20:57.055
Best summer vacation ever!

20:57.057 --> 20:58.957
Wait till you see
the itinerary.

20:58.959 --> 21:00.525
Oh!

21:00.527 --> 21:01.894
That's nice.

21:01.896 --> 21:04.662
Frank, "fire bad." Remember?

21:04.664 --> 21:07.265
Oh, yeah, right, but,
uh, maybe you'll find

21:07.267 --> 21:09.834
your own fireworks
on the cruise, huh?

21:09.836 --> 21:11.904
It's not the Love Boat, Frank.

21:11.906 --> 21:14.910
I'm just here to have fun
with my family.

21:17.143 --> 21:19.780
Huh?

21:21.716 --> 21:22.915
Ha!

21:22.917 --> 21:24.015
Ahoy there!

21:24.017 --> 21:25.583
Welcome aboard!

21:33.894 --> 21:35.763
Whoa! Who is that?

21:40.535 --> 21:42.668
I am Captain Ericka.

21:42.670 --> 21:45.537
And, yes, I'm human. But
don't hold that against me.

21:45.539 --> 21:48.607
I could not be more excited
to have all of you on board

21:48.609 --> 21:51.142
our first-ever
monster cruise!

21:56.784 --> 21:58.786
Whoo-hoo!

22:00.254 --> 22:01.954
Dad? Are you okay?

22:01.956 --> 22:04.290
Eeny feeny fanny
foonyah wah wah?

22:04.292 --> 22:06.324
Oh, no! He's having
a heart attack!

22:06.326 --> 22:08.293
Drac? Not likely.

22:08.295 --> 22:10.728
Yeah, the only heart attack that can
hurt him is with a wooden stake.

22:10.730 --> 22:11.863
It must be a stroke!

22:11.865 --> 22:13.866
Actually, I think
it might be her.

22:13.868 --> 22:16.834
Ow! Watch where you're pointing,
mister, I'm right here.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.670
You always stand
so close to me.

22:18.672 --> 22:20.606
It's creepy.

22:20.608 --> 22:23.775
For so long, monsters were
hiding, living in the shadows,

22:23.777 --> 22:25.744
but not anymore!

22:25.746 --> 22:29.747
You've stood up and waved
your hand or claw or tentacle

22:29.749 --> 22:34.719
and said, "We're here, we're hairy,
and it is our right to be scary!"

22:37.757 --> 22:40.158
Now it's time to celebrate!

22:40.160 --> 22:43.262
You'll enjoy gourmet dining,
thrilling adventures,

22:43.264 --> 22:45.030
and nonstop entertainment,

22:45.032 --> 22:48.132
all on the way
to our final destination,

22:48.134 --> 22:51.235
the lost city
that isn't lost anymore,

22:51.237 --> 22:53.906
Atlantis!

22:58.211 --> 22:59.712
Oh, yeah!

22:59.714 --> 23:01.112
Whoo-hoo!

23:01.114 --> 23:03.349
Whoa!
The fish are acrobats!

23:03.351 --> 23:05.184
They're fishcrobats!

23:08.288 --> 23:10.755
Hello. How y'all doing?

23:10.757 --> 23:12.957
So...

23:12.959 --> 23:16.331
You must be
the one and only Dracula.

23:18.198 --> 23:21.766
I have waited so long
to meet you.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.901
Wow, you really don't age,
do you?

23:23.903 --> 23:25.337
I would kill
for your skin.

23:25.339 --> 23:28.741
Eh doobeeday
shoolah eh koobeeday?

23:28.743 --> 23:30.676
Oh. You're speaking
Transylvanian.

23:30.678 --> 23:32.110
Oh. Always wanted
to learn.

23:32.112 --> 23:34.979
Uh, eh doobeeday
shoolah koobeeday?

23:34.981 --> 23:37.116
- Eh koobeeday.
- Koobeeday.

23:37.118 --> 23:38.984
- Eh koobeeday.
- Koobeeday.

23:38.986 --> 23:41.020
Eh doobeeday
shoolah koobeeday.

23:41.022 --> 23:43.789
Doolah-day shoolah koobeeday.

23:43.791 --> 23:46.024
Oh, such a romantic language.

23:46.026 --> 23:47.959
You know, there's just
something about an accent

23:47.961 --> 23:51.362
that makes a man
sound so intelligent.

23:51.364 --> 23:52.930
Alibooboo.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.667
That's Transylvanian
right there.

23:54.669 --> 23:56.769
He's saying
it's nice to meet you.

23:56.771 --> 24:00.438
Well, then
"alibooboo" to you as well.

24:00.440 --> 24:03.975
- Alibooboo. Alibooboo.
- Drac! Drac, snap out of it.

24:03.977 --> 24:05.910
Wait. I've always wanted
to do this.

24:05.912 --> 24:07.979
Wake up! Wake up, Drac!

24:07.981 --> 24:09.247
Snap out of it!

24:09.249 --> 24:10.748
Hey, cut it out!

24:10.750 --> 24:12.051
Hey, buddy, you okay?

24:12.053 --> 24:14.719
No, not okay.

24:14.721 --> 24:16.088
Not okay!

24:16.090 --> 24:18.157
I... I...

24:18.159 --> 24:19.691
I...

24:19.693 --> 24:21.261
Zinged.

25:09.375 --> 25:11.744
Mmm!

25:13.514 --> 25:14.780
- Ooh!
- Oh!

25:14.782 --> 25:15.817
Check that out!

25:16.883 --> 25:19.120
Ah!

25:21.855 --> 25:24.289
Here we go.

25:24.291 --> 25:25.794
Mmm, yummy.

25:37.237 --> 25:38.305
Ah!

25:57.391 --> 25:58.392
Papa.

26:11.971 --> 26:14.173
"Kids Club."

26:14.175 --> 26:15.877
What's a kids club?

26:21.348 --> 26:22.350
Whee!

26:23.249 --> 26:24.251
Whee!

26:26.853 --> 26:29.388
- Fish.
- That's right, dear.

26:29.390 --> 26:30.988
I'm still not sure
I understand.

26:30.990 --> 26:34.525
You take my kids,
all day, on purpose?

26:34.527 --> 26:35.960
Fish.

26:35.962 --> 26:37.228
That's right.

26:37.230 --> 26:39.398
What exactly
don't you understand?

26:39.400 --> 26:41.265
- Why? Ow!
- Shh.

26:41.267 --> 26:44.969
So they can have a great time,
and you can have a great time.

26:44.971 --> 26:47.339
Fish.

26:47.341 --> 26:50.844
Oh, don't worry, you get them
back at the end of the day.

26:51.879 --> 26:53.277
Fish.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.415
Oh, well. That's better
than nothing.

26:57.218 --> 26:58.786
Oh. Oh!

27:05.191 --> 27:06.257
So...

27:06.259 --> 27:07.892
What do we do now?

27:07.894 --> 27:12.266
I think we do
whatever we want.

27:13.300 --> 27:15.466
"Whatever we want"?

27:15.468 --> 27:17.535
Whatever we want.

27:17.537 --> 27:18.937
Whatever we want.

27:18.939 --> 27:20.272
Whatever we want!

27:20.274 --> 27:24.176
Whatever we want.

27:24.178 --> 27:26.978
- Stop! Help me!
- Whatever we want.

27:26.980 --> 27:29.016
- Whatever we want.
- Whatever we want.

27:30.083 --> 27:31.550
Oh, hi. Hello.

27:31.552 --> 27:33.217
How y'all doin'?

27:33.219 --> 27:34.386
- Oh.
- Good evening, Captain.

27:34.388 --> 27:36.388
Well, hello.
Oh, my goodness.

27:36.390 --> 27:38.256
Ah!

27:38.258 --> 27:41.927
Would you mind, uh, lifting your tail?
You know...

27:41.929 --> 27:43.195
Oh! Certainly.

27:43.197 --> 27:45.500
Okay. Thank you
so much.

27:47.901 --> 27:49.368
Oh, hello.

27:49.370 --> 27:50.438
Welcome aboard.

28:17.230 --> 28:21.300
Ugh! You were so right,
Great-Grandfather.

28:21.302 --> 28:24.202
Monsters are disgusting!

28:24.204 --> 28:26.140
They're animals!

28:43.090 --> 28:45.122
I'll be right there.

28:52.999 --> 28:55.333
Dracula, is he on board?

28:55.335 --> 28:58.637
Yes. I saw him.
Face-to-face. Ugh!

28:58.639 --> 29:00.272
I was so nice to him.

29:00.274 --> 29:02.573
That pale face of his
and his goofy smile,

29:02.575 --> 29:04.275
showing off his fangs.

29:04.277 --> 29:06.078
Argh, it's just like
you taught me!

29:06.080 --> 29:08.647
It's even worse than I feared!

29:08.649 --> 29:11.750
It was that fateful night
that I realized

29:11.752 --> 29:15.353
a human could never defeat
a monster.

29:19.493 --> 29:23.328
<i>But I wouldn't let
our family legacy die.</i>

29:23.330 --> 29:28.300
<i>And so, I began to search
for an answer.</i>

29:28.302 --> 29:33.571
<i>And I saw it in an ancient text,
an instrument of destruction</i>

29:33.573 --> 29:36.108
<i>so powerful
it destroyed Atlantis,</i>

29:36.110 --> 29:40.012
<i>a whole city of monsters.</i>

29:40.014 --> 29:44.282
<i>And there, deep within the
rubble, it lay, waiting.</i>

29:44.284 --> 29:48.085
Endlessly, I searched
for the lost city

29:48.087 --> 29:51.590
Time passed, and my body
began to fail me.

29:51.592 --> 29:54.191
Oh, it was so sad, Ericka.

29:54.193 --> 29:56.695
First my liver,
then my spleen,

29:56.697 --> 29:59.363
followed by a kidney or two.

29:59.365 --> 30:03.034
Then my golden locks.

30:03.036 --> 30:05.570
But I wouldn't let
that stop me.

30:05.572 --> 30:10.542
I replaced my failing organs
with technology!

30:10.544 --> 30:12.244
Ha-ha!

30:12.246 --> 30:14.146
And look at me now.

30:14.148 --> 30:15.746
Mmm-hmm!

30:15.748 --> 30:18.618
Oh, girl,
it's an improvement, really.

30:19.719 --> 30:22.053
Um, sure.

30:22.055 --> 30:27.725
And now, after 120 years,
I have finally found Atlantis.

30:27.727 --> 30:29.561
Oh, forget about all this!

30:29.563 --> 30:31.162
Let me get rid of
Dracula right now.

30:31.164 --> 30:32.798
I was so close to him,
I could've just...

30:34.700 --> 30:37.369
No, no, no!

30:37.371 --> 30:39.404
We have to
stick to the plan.

30:39.406 --> 30:41.273
Lure the monsters
to Atlantis,

30:41.275 --> 30:43.641
retrieve the instrument
of destruction,

30:43.643 --> 30:46.511
trap them there,
and then wipe them out.

30:46.513 --> 30:48.346
It's simple, Ericka!

30:48.348 --> 30:51.416
Now, promise me you won't
try and kill Dracula.

30:51.418 --> 30:52.818
Ugh, fine!

30:52.820 --> 30:55.253
- I promise.
- Promise what?

30:55.255 --> 30:58.790
I promise I won't
try and kill Dracula. Okay?

31:03.529 --> 31:05.330
Ugh.

31:05.332 --> 31:09.400
Don't worry, Great-Grandfather,
I won't try and kill him...

31:09.402 --> 31:11.171
I will kill him.

31:37.898 --> 31:39.363
Whew!

32:13.833 --> 32:15.402
Ugh!

32:23.310 --> 32:24.645
Oh!

32:52.939 --> 32:54.939
Work it, Dracula.

32:54.941 --> 32:56.643
You know it.

32:57.811 --> 33:00.477
Oh! Lookin' good, Drac!

33:00.479 --> 33:01.846
Feeling good, Frank.

33:01.848 --> 33:04.416
Look at you, so fancy!

33:04.418 --> 33:05.984
What? This? Please.

33:05.986 --> 33:07.985
Ooh! Dressed to impress, huh?

33:07.987 --> 33:09.620
"Impress"? Oh.

33:09.622 --> 33:11.523
Who do I need to impress?

33:11.525 --> 33:13.390
Hey, isn't that
Captain Ericka?

33:13.392 --> 33:14.959
Oh, no!

33:14.961 --> 33:17.294
Uh, what? Eh, oh...

33:17.296 --> 33:18.696
Oops, no,
not her.

33:20.266 --> 33:21.899
Ooh, that's good!

33:21.901 --> 33:23.001
Very amusing.

33:32.411 --> 33:35.312
Sorry, Drac. You know, it's just
we've never seen you like this.

33:35.314 --> 33:36.548
I know.

33:36.550 --> 33:37.948
It doesn't make any sense.

33:37.950 --> 33:40.685
You can't Zing twice,
it's impossible!

33:40.687 --> 33:42.987
But I did! So now what?

33:42.989 --> 33:45.657
And what about Mavis?

33:45.659 --> 33:47.792
She wants you
to be happy, right?

33:47.794 --> 33:50.629
I'm sure she'll go
with the flow.

33:50.631 --> 33:52.363
Oh, no, no, no!

33:52.365 --> 33:54.832
Mavis needs me.
She depends on me.

33:54.834 --> 33:57.901
I need to be home
with my family.

33:57.903 --> 34:02.006
Hey, Murray here may be from
Egypt, but you're the one in

34:02.008 --> 34:03.541
"da Nile."

34:05.045 --> 34:06.710
You guys get that?

34:06.712 --> 34:07.978
Ow! You hit me right in the...

34:07.980 --> 34:08.983
Mavis!

34:12.717 --> 34:14.987
Don't say a word, or
I'll haunt your dreams.

34:16.523 --> 34:18.322
Having fun?

34:18.324 --> 34:20.724
Oh, I'm having even more fun
now that you're here.

34:20.726 --> 34:24.829
You know, Dad, I feel really lucky
to have this time with you.

34:24.831 --> 34:27.731
All of us together,
it's really special.

34:27.733 --> 34:30.635
Me, too,
spider monkey.

34:30.637 --> 34:33.905
Now, are you ready for me to
destroy you in monster ball?

34:33.907 --> 34:36.675
Whoo-hoo! Monster ball!

34:36.677 --> 34:37.940
Come on, Papa Drac!

34:37.943 --> 34:39.643
Bring it on!

34:39.646 --> 34:42.248
For I am king of family fun!

34:44.885 --> 34:48.620
Ha-ha! All right!
Who is ready to get pummeled?

34:50.090 --> 34:52.322
I got to warn you,

34:52.324 --> 34:55.327
I played second-team coed intramural
volleyball at Santa Cruz.

34:55.329 --> 34:58.028
Sure, pal. Whatever you say.

34:58.030 --> 35:00.765
Everybody, just please
watch the hair.

35:00.767 --> 35:02.599
Watch the hair!

35:02.601 --> 35:05.003
Oh-ho-ho! Let's go!
Let's do this!

35:05.005 --> 35:07.472
Oh, my gosh, this is
gonna be so much fun.

35:07.474 --> 35:08.840
Ha-ha! Get ready.

35:08.842 --> 35:10.443
Here comes the pain!

35:14.046 --> 35:16.881
- Spike!
- Not the hair!

35:16.883 --> 35:18.686
Whoa!

35:20.586 --> 35:22.921
No, no, no!

35:24.057 --> 35:26.957
All right!

35:26.959 --> 35:30.128
<i>Captain
Ericka, you are needed on deck.</i>

35:30.130 --> 35:33.530
Next stop...
Buh-bye, Dracula.

35:33.532 --> 35:35.068
Ha-ha! All right, baby!

35:57.391 --> 35:58.823
Oh, baby, I got this.

35:58.825 --> 36:00.392
Hey there, monsters.

36:00.394 --> 36:01.394
Huh?

36:03.829 --> 36:05.932
Yeah! What'd I say!

36:08.834 --> 36:11.072
<i>We're arriving
at our first destination.</i>

36:16.610 --> 36:19.843
<i>The underwater volcano!</i>

36:19.845 --> 36:23.948
<i>Everyone, grab your scuba
gear and get ready to explore</i>

36:23.950 --> 36:26.354
<i>the wonders of the sea.</i>

36:26.987 --> 36:28.952
Especially you,

36:28.954 --> 36:30.523
Count Dracula.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.494
You see that, pal?
She likes you.

36:36.496 --> 36:37.861
Oh, no, no, no.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.930
That sounds like a Zing
in full effect.

36:39.932 --> 36:41.832
Oh, no, no, no.

36:41.834 --> 36:43.535
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

36:43.537 --> 36:46.171
I'm just here
to have family fun.

36:46.173 --> 36:48.476
Family, family, fun, fun.

37:10.095 --> 37:12.532
Hmm, let's see.
What about here?

37:33.086 --> 37:35.089
Right this way, everyone.

37:47.166 --> 37:51.135
Welcome to one of the true wonders
of the underwater kingdom.

37:51.137 --> 37:54.671
I give you Volcano del Fuego.

37:54.673 --> 37:56.974
Or, as the local sea life
call it...

38:56.970 --> 38:58.836
Whee!

39:53.392 --> 39:54.925
Aw, what a cute family.

39:54.927 --> 39:55.994
What? No, it's not.

39:55.996 --> 39:57.831
Argh! Dracula bad!

41:12.738 --> 41:14.104
Frank, we just ate.

41:14.106 --> 41:16.274
I can't believe
you're hungry already.

41:16.276 --> 41:18.008
I'm sorry.
You know what it is?

41:18.010 --> 41:19.943
It's all... Just all that
seafood just swimming around,

41:19.945 --> 41:21.912
and when I "see food..."

41:21.914 --> 41:25.015
Oh, man! I'm gone.

41:25.017 --> 41:27.952
Oh! Dracula, Dracula, Dracula!

41:27.954 --> 41:30.021
Dracula, Dracula!

41:30.023 --> 41:33.124
I get so close, but it's
almost like he's teasing me.

41:33.126 --> 41:35.358
I just, I can't
stand it anymore.

41:35.360 --> 41:36.663
I have to get him!

41:47.439 --> 41:50.874
Boy, that underwater volcano
looked hot.

41:50.876 --> 41:52.746
Mmm-hmm.

41:56.448 --> 41:58.381
Oh... Hi, Bob.

41:58.383 --> 42:02.352
Right. We promised you we'd
play, uh, ping-pong now.

42:02.354 --> 42:04.921
Um, Dennis?
Who is this?

42:04.923 --> 42:06.990
Uh, it's our friend, Bob.

42:06.992 --> 42:08.828
- Say hi, Bob.
- "Hi, Bob."

42:10.296 --> 42:13.296
Okay! Time to go
play ping-pong.

42:13.298 --> 42:14.432
- Drac!
- Drac!

42:14.434 --> 42:17.037
- Drac!
- Drac!

42:18.872 --> 42:21.071
Hey, boys,
where's the fire?

42:21.073 --> 42:22.439
Oh, well,
Griffin here, he...

42:22.441 --> 42:24.809
- He has something to tell you.
- Me? Uh...

42:24.811 --> 42:27.178
Oh. Yeah, I got this bite on
my hand, and since, you know,

42:27.180 --> 42:29.479
you're a biting expert, I
thought you could take a look.

42:29.481 --> 42:31.401
- Yeah. Come on over here.
- The light is better.

42:32.284 --> 42:33.820
Okay...

42:35.521 --> 42:37.921
Okay, what is going on?

42:37.923 --> 42:40.957
You guys are acting weirder than normal,
and your normal is pretty weird.

42:40.959 --> 42:42.959
You are not gonna believe
what we heard, but...

42:57.010 --> 42:59.443
Shh. I told you I don't
want to upset Mavis.

42:59.445 --> 43:02.180
But what are you talking about?

43:02.182 --> 43:04.481
Okay, well, see, Frank got
hungry, so no surprise there...

43:04.483 --> 43:08.352
But we swam back to the ship, and
we found Ericka raving about you.

43:08.354 --> 43:10.187
She can't live
without you, buddy.

43:10.189 --> 43:11.923
It's serious!

43:15.961 --> 43:19.363
So, Drac, this is great. Are you gonna
make a move on the captain, or what?

43:19.365 --> 43:20.997
Uh, yes.

43:20.999 --> 43:23.501
- Maybe? No.
- Ugh.

43:23.503 --> 43:26.838
It's been a while. I don't
even know where to start.

43:26.840 --> 43:29.240
It's easy, Drac.
Just make some small talk.

43:29.242 --> 43:31.075
- Remember to smile.
- Look into her eyes.

43:31.077 --> 43:33.077
- Keep it casual.
- Say something funny.

43:33.079 --> 43:34.345
Ask her where
her parts are from.

43:34.347 --> 43:36.046
Oh, and say
that her wrappings look nice.

43:36.048 --> 43:37.849
- "Do you like coffins?"
- Compliment her.

43:37.851 --> 43:39.850
- "Your neck looks delicious."
- Here she comes.

43:39.852 --> 43:42.253
Okay, Drac,
hit it.

43:42.255 --> 43:44.454
Your delicious neck wrappings
are in a nice coffin.

43:44.456 --> 43:47.358
Would you like
to see my parts?

43:50.162 --> 43:52.262
Yes, I'd love to go out
with you.

43:52.264 --> 43:53.497
Ay! What?

43:53.499 --> 43:54.631
What?

43:54.633 --> 43:56.032
Cantina. Midnight.

43:56.034 --> 43:57.103
Don't be late.

44:06.880 --> 44:08.079
Whew!

44:08.081 --> 44:09.448
That was a close one.

44:13.086 --> 44:15.823
- Wait! Stop it, Tinkles, stop!
- Wait, Tinkles. Come back.

44:25.664 --> 44:27.164
- Tinkles, stop!
- Wait!

44:27.166 --> 44:28.302
No, no, no!

44:41.514 --> 44:42.646
Tinkles, stop!

44:42.648 --> 44:45.115
I've been found!

44:45.117 --> 44:48.119
You'll never get me, monster!

44:48.121 --> 44:50.620
Shh! Tinkles, stop.
Shh! Shh!

45:04.369 --> 45:05.872
Ew.

45:14.981 --> 45:20.450
<i>Everybody, we are pulling up
to our next stop, the Deserted Island.</i>

45:20.452 --> 45:22.720
<i>It's time to get lost
on the beach,</i>

45:22.722 --> 45:28.128
<i>and we hope you'll find yourself
some fun and relaxation.</i>

45:29.461 --> 45:31.628
Whoo-hoo!
Beach time!

45:31.630 --> 45:33.463
Johnny, you go
set everything up.

45:33.465 --> 45:35.399
And, Dad, you go get in
line for the snow cones.

45:35.401 --> 45:38.169
You know, actually,
I was thinking you and Johnny

45:38.171 --> 45:40.003
should spend
some time together.

45:40.005 --> 45:42.439
What do you call it again?
Eh, date night?

45:42.441 --> 45:43.974
Date night?

45:43.976 --> 45:45.742
- What are you gonna do?
- Well, I thought

45:45.744 --> 45:48.111
me and the guys would
take this opportunity

45:48.113 --> 45:51.215
to spend some quality time
with Dennis.

45:51.217 --> 45:53.084
Oh. Okay.
That's a great idea.

45:53.086 --> 45:54.751
Come on, Johnny.
Date night.

45:54.753 --> 45:57.523
Duh-duh-duh-duh-date night!

46:12.405 --> 46:14.204
Okay, here you go!

46:19.345 --> 46:21.148
- Good girl!
- I got this one.

46:30.188 --> 46:31.689
What was that?

46:31.691 --> 46:33.590
It sounds like our children.

46:33.592 --> 46:36.427
- It is our children! Run!
- Run!

46:36.429 --> 46:38.495
Please! Help! Someone!

46:38.497 --> 46:40.463
Get the parents!

46:40.465 --> 46:43.401
Frank? Would you rub
some moonscreen on my back

46:43.403 --> 46:45.035
before I get burned?

46:45.037 --> 46:46.236
Wait one second, honey.

46:46.238 --> 46:47.838
You know, the kids buried me
in the sand.

46:54.079 --> 46:55.745
Mmm. Thanks, honey.

46:55.747 --> 46:58.249
- Shall we have another?
- Sure.

46:58.251 --> 47:01.584
- Sounds good.
- Straight up.

47:01.586 --> 47:03.720
Isn't this place amazing?

47:03.722 --> 47:06.724
Whoa! The menu is in a bottle!

47:06.726 --> 47:08.628
Genius! Isn't that
awesome, honey?

47:11.130 --> 47:12.762
What? Oh, sorry.

47:12.764 --> 47:14.765
I was just thinking
about my dad.

47:14.767 --> 47:17.668
Don't you think
he's acting weird lately?

47:17.670 --> 47:21.104
Not really. Besides having
a huge crush on the captain.

47:21.106 --> 47:23.073
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

47:23.075 --> 47:25.642
The Love Boat is definitely
making another run.

47:25.644 --> 47:27.410
No way. He's...

47:27.412 --> 47:29.680
He's my dad.

47:29.682 --> 47:31.481
I know, right? It's weird.

47:31.483 --> 47:35.318
When my parents kiss,
I still close my eyes.

47:35.320 --> 47:40.624
I guess I never thought about
him with anyone besides my mom.

47:40.626 --> 47:43.126
You're cool with it,
though, right?

47:43.128 --> 47:45.262
Of course. I want him
to be happy.

47:45.264 --> 47:46.266
Totally.

47:48.334 --> 47:50.166
Totally.

47:56.409 --> 47:58.876
<i>Buenas noches, mi amigo.</i>

47:58.878 --> 48:04.881
Have you a beverage
to quench me of my parchment?

48:04.883 --> 48:07.387
Yes, of course,
Mr. Chupacabra.

48:11.289 --> 48:13.226
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

48:29.175 --> 48:30.508
You look ravishing.

48:30.510 --> 48:31.608
Oh.

48:31.610 --> 48:32.809
Uh, thank you. I just...

48:32.811 --> 48:34.313
Oh.

48:43.356 --> 48:45.222
So, um...

48:45.224 --> 48:48.291
Does Captain Ericka
have a last name?

48:48.293 --> 48:49.760
Uh, oh, uh...

48:49.762 --> 48:51.896
Oh, guacamole!

48:51.898 --> 48:53.430
"Ericka Guacamole"?

48:53.432 --> 48:56.767
That's so international.

48:56.769 --> 49:00.570
No.
Guacamole for us to share.

49:00.572 --> 49:02.939
Oh, how beautiful
is that full moon tonight?

49:02.941 --> 49:04.376
Look. Right behind you.

49:08.780 --> 49:12.249
Mmm! The food here
is to die for.

49:22.894 --> 49:26.829
Holy moly, that was
a lot of guacamole.

49:26.831 --> 49:29.200
Are you feeling all right?

49:29.202 --> 49:31.869
- Totally fine. Why?
- No reason.

49:33.738 --> 49:35.405
Oh...

49:35.407 --> 49:38.841
There must have been garlic
in the guacamole.

49:38.843 --> 49:40.376
Oh, no.

49:40.378 --> 49:41.845
Isn't that deadly
for you?

49:41.847 --> 49:43.816
No, no, no.
It's just that I'm...

49:44.749 --> 49:46.418
Garlic intolerant.

49:54.726 --> 49:55.895
Was that you?

49:57.729 --> 50:00.497
Whoo!

50:00.499 --> 50:01.731
Oh, yeah!

50:01.733 --> 50:03.934
Dolphin surfing!

50:11.510 --> 50:12.642
Whoa!

50:12.644 --> 50:14.577
Hi, Mama. Hi, Papa.

50:14.579 --> 50:15.713
Hey-hey.

50:15.715 --> 50:17.448
Oh! Hey there.

50:17.450 --> 50:19.450
- Papa.
- Hidey-ho!

50:19.452 --> 50:20.651
Hi.

50:20.653 --> 50:23.019
Is my dad
in there, too?

50:25.358 --> 50:27.624
Don't worry,
I'm over here. Bleh, bleh-bleh.

50:27.626 --> 50:31.664
No, Papa Drac's not here.
He's on his date.

50:32.430 --> 50:33.532
Date?

50:36.434 --> 50:38.901
Please, forgive me,

50:38.903 --> 50:40.604
I'm just very nervous.

50:40.606 --> 50:42.573
You see,

50:42.575 --> 50:47.814
I haven't had a date
since my wife died.

50:49.849 --> 50:51.782
How old was your daughter?

50:51.784 --> 50:53.751
She was just an infant.

50:53.753 --> 50:55.718
It was hard
being a single dad,

50:55.720 --> 50:58.257
but I did my best.

51:00.925 --> 51:03.693
I never knew
my mother, either.

51:03.695 --> 51:04.861
Or my father.

51:04.863 --> 51:07.064
Oh, I'm so sorry.

51:07.066 --> 51:08.599
Who raised you?

51:08.601 --> 51:10.668
My great-grandfather.

51:10.670 --> 51:13.370
I basically grew up
on this ship.

51:13.372 --> 51:15.606
That's why
you're a captain.

51:15.608 --> 51:18.876
Yeah. It's all
I've ever known.

51:18.878 --> 51:21.381
It was just expected.

51:22.347 --> 51:23.847
You know, a family thing.

51:23.849 --> 51:27.785
I understand,
family is everything.

51:27.787 --> 51:30.553
You have to honor the past.

51:30.555 --> 51:32.825
But we make our own future.

51:46.072 --> 51:48.071
- Dad?
- Mavis!

51:48.073 --> 51:50.610
- Mmm.
- Johnny!

51:52.977 --> 51:58.015
Captain Ericka and I were just
discussing the hospitality industry.

51:58.017 --> 52:00.084
You know,
just work stuff.

52:00.086 --> 52:01.651
You're working now?

52:01.653 --> 52:03.553
This is supposed to be
a vacation.

52:03.555 --> 52:04.954
A family vacation.

52:04.956 --> 52:08.591
I should really go
do captain-y things.

52:08.593 --> 52:11.628
Dad, you said you were
gonna spend time with Dennis.

52:11.630 --> 52:14.832
Dennis. Dennis? Dennis.

52:14.834 --> 52:17.600
Oh! Yeah, you're right.
Where is that kid?

52:17.602 --> 52:20.137
Denisovich? You're
supposed to be with me.

52:20.139 --> 52:22.405
Come on now, kid,
it's family time.

52:22.407 --> 52:23.909
Quit hiding. Dennis?

52:25.477 --> 52:26.677
What was that about?

52:26.679 --> 52:27.977
You mean
your dad's date?

52:27.979 --> 52:30.981
It wasn't a date.
It was work stuff.

52:30.983 --> 52:32.149
Uh-huh.

52:32.151 --> 52:33.983
I'm telling you, Johnny,

52:33.985 --> 52:35.818
there is something about
that woman I don't trust.

52:35.820 --> 52:38.921
But you want your dad
to be happy, right?

52:38.923 --> 52:40.423
Yes.

52:40.425 --> 52:42.459
Just not with her.

52:42.461 --> 52:44.160
Mmm.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

52:44.162 --> 52:45.595
Heads up, honey.

52:45.597 --> 52:47.765
This guac is loaded
with garlic.

52:47.767 --> 52:48.835
Garlic?

52:55.573 --> 52:57.876
Aw! That was
a cute toot, honey.

53:15.160 --> 53:17.995
- We've been up all night!
- Let's stay up all day, too!

53:17.997 --> 53:19.896
Let's get wild!

53:32.610 --> 53:34.611
- Ericka!
- What?

53:34.613 --> 53:37.981
Just where have you been, young lady?

53:37.983 --> 53:40.450
Uh, doing work.

53:40.452 --> 53:42.452
Wearing that?

53:42.454 --> 53:44.988
You were with him!
I know it!

53:44.990 --> 53:46.957
Who?

53:46.959 --> 53:49.091
"Who?" You know who!

53:49.093 --> 53:51.662
You've been sneaking around
my back

53:51.664 --> 53:54.997
trying to kill Dracula again,
haven't you?

53:54.999 --> 53:57.800
So what if I have?
I am a grown woman!

53:57.802 --> 53:59.102
I have the right to kill
whoever I want.

53:59.104 --> 54:01.571
It's not just about you.

54:01.573 --> 54:04.874
You could have ruined
the legacy.

54:04.876 --> 54:07.644
What if he discovered
who you were?

54:07.646 --> 54:10.948
I know. I wasn't thinking.
There's just something about him

54:10.950 --> 54:12.883
that just drives me crazy!

54:12.885 --> 54:15.017
I just, I see him,
and I want to...

54:15.019 --> 54:16.153
Punch him?

54:16.155 --> 54:18.856
Uh... I guess.

54:18.858 --> 54:20.923
Just, I can't wait
to get this over with.

54:20.925 --> 54:23.160
Don't worry,
it won't be long now.

54:23.162 --> 54:26.597
Once you recover the
instrument of destruction,

54:26.599 --> 54:28.599
no one can stop us.

54:28.601 --> 54:30.470
Not even Dracula!

54:31.537 --> 54:33.907
- Oh. Excuse me.
- Spies!

54:38.577 --> 54:40.910
Now, quickly,
before someone comes!

55:02.034 --> 55:04.668
<i>Everyone assemble
on the forward deck.</i>

55:04.670 --> 55:08.571
<i>We are arriving
at our final destination.</i>

55:08.573 --> 55:10.140
From the depths of creation,

55:10.142 --> 55:13.876
the mighty city has risen
once again.

55:13.878 --> 55:16.680
<i>Home to the greatest
monster civilization</i>

55:16.682 --> 55:18.582
<i>the world has ever known,</i>

55:18.584 --> 55:23.287
far surpassing Athens and Rome in
art, culture and sophistication.

55:23.289 --> 55:28.628
I give you the legendary
lost city of Atlantis.

55:53.751 --> 55:56.919
It's a giant Kraken!

56:43.001 --> 56:45.968
<i>Welcome to Atlantis!</i>

56:50.876 --> 56:51.878
Oh!

57:05.858 --> 57:07.990
Ooh. I am so excited!

57:07.992 --> 57:09.295
Come to Daddy!

57:11.930 --> 57:13.296
- Oh.
- Twenty-eight black!

57:14.867 --> 57:15.867
Oh!

57:17.869 --> 57:20.370
- Ahhh!
- Oh, no, you don't.

57:20.372 --> 57:23.372
Last time you gambled, you lost
an arm and a leg. Literally!

57:23.374 --> 57:25.374
- Replacement limbs...
- I'll raise you 40.

57:25.376 --> 57:27.843
...aren't just lying around
like they were in the old days.

57:27.845 --> 57:30.146
So, no gambling.

57:30.148 --> 57:31.280
Frank!

57:31.282 --> 57:33.218
Yes, dear! Got it!
No gambling!

57:39.758 --> 57:41.425
- Tinkles, stop.
- Wait.

57:41.427 --> 57:43.727
- Stop it, Tinkles, stop.
- Ah! Wait!

57:47.231 --> 57:49.265
Have you guys seen Mavis?
I have to find her.

57:49.267 --> 57:50.767
Why? What's going on?

57:50.769 --> 57:52.803
I'm going to tell her
about Ericka.

57:52.805 --> 57:55.271
I can't lie to
my own daughter anymore.

57:55.273 --> 57:58.175
She's the most important
person in the world to me.

57:58.177 --> 58:00.179
I have to tell her the truth.

58:02.380 --> 58:04.216
Right after I talk to Ericka.

58:06.485 --> 58:07.687
Hey.

58:09.921 --> 58:11.253
All right, I'm all...

58:11.255 --> 58:13.323
Frank, are you sure
you know what you're doing?

58:13.325 --> 58:16.029
I got this. I'm all in.

58:19.197 --> 58:21.131
Johnny, have you seen
my dad?

58:21.133 --> 58:23.867
- Maybe he's with Bob.
- Why would he be with Bob?

58:23.869 --> 58:25.869
Bob's a great guy.

58:25.871 --> 58:27.939
- Oh, there he is.
- Who? Bob?

58:45.289 --> 58:48.191
There he is!
Hi, Bob!

01:00:13.579 --> 01:00:14.781
Oh.

01:01:27.218 --> 01:01:28.421
There it is.

01:01:46.938 --> 01:01:48.405
You saved my life.

01:01:48.407 --> 01:01:50.340
Of course.
Why wouldn't I?

01:01:50.342 --> 01:01:53.977
I just can't believe you
would do that for a human.

01:01:53.979 --> 01:01:57.012
Humans, monsters,
what's the difference?

01:01:57.014 --> 01:02:00.050
Yeah, right. Right.

01:02:00.052 --> 01:02:02.285
Wait. What are you doing here?

01:02:02.287 --> 01:02:06.122
Oh, uh... Well, you know,
vampires can predict the future,

01:02:06.124 --> 01:02:09.158
so I knew you would
need my help.

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.394
Ha! Never heard that before.

01:02:11.396 --> 01:02:13.463
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's a well-known fact.

01:02:14.666 --> 01:02:16.332
What are you doing here?

01:02:16.334 --> 01:02:17.466
Oh! Uh...

01:02:17.468 --> 01:02:19.568
Well, I'm here to get that.

01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:21.537
Yeah, it's a family heirloom.

01:02:21.539 --> 01:02:26.175
Yeah, it was lost at sea, and
my great-grandfather is... Was!

01:02:26.177 --> 01:02:29.512
Uh, was totally obsessed
with getting it back.

01:02:29.514 --> 01:02:33.952
So, anywho, thanks for saving my
life, but I can take it from...

01:02:39.691 --> 01:02:41.224
Got to be
a little more careful.

01:02:41.226 --> 01:02:43.126
How many times
can you save my life, right?

01:02:43.128 --> 01:02:45.595
I don't know. Every time?

01:02:45.597 --> 01:02:48.167
Really? Well, then...

01:03:22.733 --> 01:03:24.069
Wow!

01:03:41.586 --> 01:03:44.557
Ah,
that was incredible.

01:03:55.733 --> 01:03:57.367
Oh, uh...

01:03:57.369 --> 01:04:00.472
Don't you want to get
your family heirloom thingy?

01:04:01.305 --> 01:04:03.108
Oh. Right.

01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:10.546
Got it.

01:04:39.410 --> 01:04:41.410
Mmm.

01:04:41.412 --> 01:04:43.278
Oh, here, let me get
that for you.

01:04:45.550 --> 01:04:46.718
Dad!

01:04:47.885 --> 01:04:49.651
Mavis!

01:04:49.653 --> 01:04:51.454
What are you doing
to my father?

01:04:51.456 --> 01:04:53.423
Wait! Whoa. Whoa!

01:04:53.425 --> 01:04:55.691
Mavis, stop!
Put her down!

01:04:55.693 --> 01:04:59.195
No! She's trying to hurt you.
Why can't you see that?

01:05:00.599 --> 01:05:03.465
Because I...

01:05:03.467 --> 01:05:05.702
Because I Zinged.

01:05:05.704 --> 01:05:07.202
What?

01:05:07.204 --> 01:05:09.741
I Zinged with Ericka.

01:05:10.909 --> 01:05:13.209
No, that can't be true.

01:05:13.211 --> 01:05:14.744
You only Zing once.

01:05:14.746 --> 01:05:17.379
That's what I thought, too.

01:05:17.381 --> 01:05:19.682
"Zing"? What's a Zing?

01:05:19.684 --> 01:05:23.720
Uh, well, it's a thing
for monsters.

01:05:23.722 --> 01:05:26.523
It's kind of like
our "love at first sight."

01:05:26.525 --> 01:05:29.358
What? No. No, no, no.

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:31.693
- You don't even know me.
- Well, not yet.

01:05:31.695 --> 01:05:34.196
- But we're just...
- No, you don't understand.

01:05:34.198 --> 01:05:35.731
I can't be with you.

01:05:35.733 --> 01:05:38.668
I could never be
with someone like you.

01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:39.805
I could never be with

01:05:40.738 --> 01:05:41.840
a monster.

01:05:52.584 --> 01:05:55.350
Dad, I'm so sorry.

01:05:55.352 --> 01:05:57.155
- I...
- It doesn't matter.

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:01.192
You heard what she said.

01:06:08.767 --> 01:06:10.602
But a Zing never lies.

01:06:24.883 --> 01:06:26.852
Ha! You got it!

01:06:27.952 --> 01:06:29.387
Yes.

01:06:33.624 --> 01:06:36.325
Now that we have
the instrument of destruction,

01:06:36.327 --> 01:06:39.262
our family legacy
will be fulfilled.

01:06:39.264 --> 01:06:43.765
But first, we'll draw them in
with a dance party!

01:06:43.767 --> 01:06:46.468
I love to dance.

01:07:00.418 --> 01:07:01.985
Frank,
could you zip me up?

01:07:01.987 --> 01:07:03.952
We're gonna be late.

01:07:03.954 --> 01:07:06.256
Where did you get those?

01:07:06.258 --> 01:07:08.457
Uh, see,
here's the funny thing.

01:07:08.459 --> 01:07:11.361
I lost my hands gambling,
but... It's no big deal!

01:07:11.363 --> 01:07:13.428
Look, I got these
from the seafood buffet.

01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:15.798
Look at this. Clickety-click,
click, clack, clack, click, click.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:18.204
I kind of like 'em.
I like 'em.

01:07:24.041 --> 01:07:25.642
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm.

01:07:25.644 --> 01:07:27.443
Mmm. Mmm.

01:07:27.445 --> 01:07:28.581
A-ha!

01:07:52.037 --> 01:07:53.870
Ah, I guess the party's
this way.

01:07:53.872 --> 01:07:54.872
Whoo!

01:07:55.939 --> 01:07:57.409
Whoa!

01:08:06.751 --> 01:08:07.753
Wow.

01:08:10.454 --> 01:08:13.021
Let's get this party
started right!

01:08:13.023 --> 01:08:14.490
- Whoo-hoo!
- All right!

01:08:14.492 --> 01:08:15.612
What?

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:18.460
Huh?

01:08:18.462 --> 01:08:21.464
I thought they said
the party was this way.

01:08:47.792 --> 01:08:49.991
DJ in a clamshell?

01:08:49.993 --> 01:08:52.495
I'm so jealous.

01:09:39.144 --> 01:09:43.112
I can't believe my dad Zinged with
someone who's trying to kill him.

01:09:43.113 --> 01:09:45.514
Yeah, the Zing
makes you do crazy things.

01:09:45.515 --> 01:09:47.750
Really, Johnny?

01:09:47.752 --> 01:09:52.522
What's most important to understand
is that love is an infinite enigma

01:09:52.524 --> 01:09:54.790
that is beyond
our understanding.

01:09:54.792 --> 01:09:58.161
You and I were two halves,
a world apart.

01:09:58.163 --> 01:10:01.197
But then we followed
the strands of destiny

01:10:01.199 --> 01:10:02.964
and were brought together.

01:10:02.966 --> 01:10:05.934
And our halves made one whole.

01:10:05.936 --> 01:10:08.137
But what if she and he...

01:10:08.139 --> 01:10:11.706
You must release all the
negativity and look within.

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:13.746
Your bond is unbreakable.

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.947
You're right, honey. Wow.

01:10:17.949 --> 01:10:19.448
Thanks.

01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:21.817
Whoa, you sounded
pretty smart, Dad.

01:10:21.819 --> 01:10:23.853
Oh, that? Yeah, it was
just the philosophy

01:10:23.855 --> 01:10:26.621
of Sifu Sing from my favorite
TV show when I was a kid,

01:10:26.623 --> 01:10:28.223
<i>Kung Fu Shaolin Monk Master.</i>

01:10:28.225 --> 01:10:29.892
Anyways, let's get back
to dancing!

01:10:29.894 --> 01:10:31.029
Cool.

01:10:35.199 --> 01:10:37.767
Dad? You have to talk
to Ericka.

01:10:37.769 --> 01:10:38.867
- What?
- I know.

01:10:38.869 --> 01:10:40.702
I know what I said before,

01:10:40.704 --> 01:10:43.572
but maybe I overreacted
a teensy bit.

01:10:43.574 --> 01:10:45.875
It's just the thought
of losing you.

01:10:45.877 --> 01:10:49.010
What? What are you talking
about, losing me?

01:10:49.012 --> 01:10:51.046
Well, obviously,
after you get married,

01:10:51.048 --> 01:10:53.014
you're gonna live on the ship
and travel around the world...

01:10:53.016 --> 01:10:55.617
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, Mavis.

01:10:55.619 --> 01:10:57.853
There are two things
I can promise you.

01:10:57.855 --> 01:11:03.692
One, nothing can ever take me
from you and all my family.

01:11:03.694 --> 01:11:06.965
Two, I will never live
on a boat.

01:11:09.501 --> 01:11:11.968
You're my cute
little tarantula.

01:11:11.970 --> 01:11:14.103
How could I ever leave you?

01:11:14.105 --> 01:11:16.104
Now, seriously,
go talk to her.

01:11:16.106 --> 01:11:18.508
I can't. You heard
what she said,

01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:21.210
she could never be
with someone like me.

01:11:21.212 --> 01:11:23.545
No, Dad.
You're just a half,

01:11:23.547 --> 01:11:27.049
and you have to follow your destiny
to find an infinite whole.

01:11:27.051 --> 01:11:28.884
You sound like Johnny.

01:11:28.886 --> 01:11:31.786
Point is,
you can't deny a Zing.

01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:34.557
Monster, human, unicorn...

01:11:34.559 --> 01:11:35.627
It doesn't matter.

01:11:36.293 --> 01:11:38.596
So go to her! Now!

01:11:40.064 --> 01:11:41.697
Okay. I'm on it.

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:44.733
Hey, man, you're
not allowed up here.

01:11:44.735 --> 01:11:47.236
The DJ booth is a sacred space.

01:11:54.244 --> 01:11:56.245
No. Tinkles, quiet.

01:11:56.247 --> 01:11:57.780
Who is this?

01:11:57.782 --> 01:12:02.183
Ha! I know you recognize me,
your greatest rival.

01:12:02.185 --> 01:12:05.086
Hmm. Oh, right.

01:12:05.088 --> 01:12:08.189
You own that Holiday Inn
down by the airport.

01:12:08.191 --> 01:12:12.827
No! It is I,
Abraham Van Helsing.

01:12:12.829 --> 01:12:14.296
Van Helsing?

01:12:14.298 --> 01:12:16.165
After all these years?

01:12:16.167 --> 01:12:18.070
You look awful.

01:12:19.304 --> 01:12:22.271
Always with the quick insults.

01:12:22.273 --> 01:12:24.807
Well, this will shut you up.

01:12:24.809 --> 01:12:26.709
And all monsters.

01:12:26.711 --> 01:12:30.746
Eh, huh? That's just Ericka's
family heirloom thingy.

01:12:30.748 --> 01:12:33.249
Good one, Ericka.

01:12:33.251 --> 01:12:34.783
Ericka?

01:12:34.785 --> 01:12:36.152
You fool.

01:12:36.154 --> 01:12:39.021
Not only is she
the ship's captain,

01:12:39.023 --> 01:12:40.923
but she also happens
to be...

01:12:43.261 --> 01:12:45.664
Wait. You tell him.

01:12:47.297 --> 01:12:49.967
I'm his great-granddaughter.

01:12:51.301 --> 01:12:54.036
I'm Ericka Van Helsing.

01:12:54.038 --> 01:12:57.039
I knew there was
something wrong with her.

01:12:57.041 --> 01:12:58.307
But...

01:12:58.309 --> 01:13:01.110
See, what happened...

01:13:01.112 --> 01:13:03.144
Now that we're all caught up,

01:13:03.146 --> 01:13:05.982
let's get back to the dying.

01:13:05.984 --> 01:13:11.387
Behold, the key to the demise
of all monsters.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.201
Let's see.

01:13:25.203 --> 01:13:27.836
Right... Okay.

01:13:30.908 --> 01:13:33.075
Listen to the melody

01:13:33.077 --> 01:13:34.947
of your destruction.

01:13:38.048 --> 01:13:40.415
Ooh, what's this little
doodad do?

01:13:41.752 --> 01:13:43.287
Yeah!

01:14:05.743 --> 01:14:08.013
Hey, look! It's the Kraken.

01:14:22.726 --> 01:14:24.061
Everybody out! Now!

01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:38.741
We're trapped! Everybody back!

01:15:00.131 --> 01:15:02.066
Yay!

01:15:09.507 --> 01:15:11.107
Baby!

01:15:11.109 --> 01:15:12.774
Papa!

01:15:22.987 --> 01:15:24.823
This has to stop now!

01:15:25.989 --> 01:15:26.988
Drac, no!

01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:27.990
Ah!

01:15:40.971 --> 01:15:42.071
Dad!

01:15:43.474 --> 01:15:44.973
Mavis!

01:15:44.975 --> 01:15:47.912
Time for the immortal Dracula
to die.

01:15:58.890 --> 01:16:00.156
Dad!

01:16:06.197 --> 01:16:07.231
No!

01:16:08.832 --> 01:16:09.867
Ericka!

01:16:14.005 --> 01:16:15.271
Bob! Help!

01:16:15.273 --> 01:16:16.475
Huh?

01:16:19.877 --> 01:16:21.009
Tinkles?

01:16:21.011 --> 01:16:22.178
Dennis.

01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:24.880
Oh, no.
Bob is Tinkles?

01:16:24.882 --> 01:16:26.281
How did he get here?

01:16:26.283 --> 01:16:28.285
But thank goodness he did,
'cause look!

01:17:09.226 --> 01:17:10.491
You can't do this!

01:17:10.493 --> 01:17:12.329
You're wrong
about monsters!

01:17:13.497 --> 01:17:16.365
Dracula... He saved my life.

01:17:16.367 --> 01:17:17.633
What?

01:17:17.635 --> 01:17:19.500
I'm so sorry, Drac.

01:17:19.502 --> 01:17:21.970
I was trying to kill you
this whole time,

01:17:21.972 --> 01:17:24.540
but then I realized
how wrong I was.

01:17:24.542 --> 01:17:26.578
How wrong all of this is.

01:17:28.078 --> 01:17:29.945
And then I...

01:17:29.947 --> 01:17:31.149
I Zinged.

01:17:32.416 --> 01:17:34.349
"Zing"? What's a Zing?

01:17:34.351 --> 01:17:35.617
It's a monster thing.

01:17:35.619 --> 01:17:37.419
You wouldn't understand.

01:17:37.421 --> 01:17:40.022
It's like true love.

01:17:40.024 --> 01:17:41.089
Love?

01:17:44.462 --> 01:17:47.228
Well, I guess the legacy
ends with me.

01:17:47.230 --> 01:17:49.164
Hmm, that's an awkward ending.

01:17:49.166 --> 01:17:50.366
Nope!

01:17:50.368 --> 01:17:53.004
It's time to start
a new legacy.

01:17:54.038 --> 01:17:56.508
A monster-human legacy.

01:17:57.675 --> 01:17:59.107
No!

01:18:05.349 --> 01:18:09.285
Drac! Van Helsing's beats are
controlling the giant octopus thingy.

01:18:09.287 --> 01:18:13.289
If there's one thing I hate,
it's an evil DJ.

01:18:13.291 --> 01:18:16.194
We need positive energy!

01:18:22.399 --> 01:18:25.533
Get ready for a DJ battle!

01:18:25.535 --> 01:18:28.469
You just carry all that
stuff around with you?

01:18:28.471 --> 01:18:31.674
Once a bar mitzvah DJ,
always a bar mitzvah DJ.

01:18:31.676 --> 01:18:35.544
We're gonna use good music
to defeat his evil music.

01:18:35.546 --> 01:18:38.179
- What?
- Trust me, I know the tunes,

01:18:38.181 --> 01:18:40.081
but you've got the power.

01:18:40.083 --> 01:18:42.116
All right. Okay.

01:18:42.118 --> 01:18:45.387
Opening song needs to
be off the shizak.

01:18:45.389 --> 01:18:47.492
Ooh, got it. Play this!

01:19:08.546 --> 01:19:10.411
What is that noise?

01:19:14.985 --> 01:19:16.384
Wow! I like this one.

01:19:16.386 --> 01:19:18.219
This feels good.

01:19:20.291 --> 01:19:22.323
The fool.

01:19:46.417 --> 01:19:49.350
Whoa! His music
is too powerful!

01:19:49.352 --> 01:19:51.687
We're gonna need something
even more positive.

01:19:51.689 --> 01:19:52.958
Now, Drac!

01:20:07.404 --> 01:20:10.072
- Really?
- It has a nice message.

01:20:19.816 --> 01:20:22.584
I've had enough
of this nonsense!

01:20:45.275 --> 01:20:48.610
Johnny, we need
the most brain-dominating,

01:20:48.612 --> 01:20:52.380
toe-tappinating song in the
history of all the universe.

01:20:55.752 --> 01:20:58.422
Come on.
Where is it?

01:21:00.423 --> 01:21:02.558
I don't know!

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:04.259
There's too many choices.

01:21:06.797 --> 01:21:08.796
No, wait!

01:21:08.798 --> 01:21:11.636
This is it.

01:21:24.414 --> 01:21:25.714
What the...

01:21:40.331 --> 01:21:42.199
Boy, that stinks.

01:21:48.372 --> 01:21:50.738
It's working!

01:21:57.515 --> 01:22:02.518
Hey, Johnny's corny music
is defeating the evil music.

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:03.852
I kind of like it.

01:22:03.854 --> 01:22:05.590
Ooh!

01:22:26.276 --> 01:22:28.477
No!

01:22:48.298 --> 01:22:50.631
Argh! Ahhh! Whoo!

01:22:50.633 --> 01:22:53.671
I'm a slave to the rhythm!

01:22:59.877 --> 01:23:01.146
No!

01:23:03.447 --> 01:23:05.380
Drac, what are you doing?

01:23:05.382 --> 01:23:07.549
You got to be greater
than the haters!

01:23:11.422 --> 01:23:13.191
Huh?

01:23:23.333 --> 01:23:24.366
Why?

01:23:24.368 --> 01:23:27.268
Why, after everything,

01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:29.403
would you save my life?

01:23:29.405 --> 01:23:32.840
Because basically
we are all the same.

01:23:32.842 --> 01:23:36.445
Claws or hands, two eyes
or three eyes.

01:23:36.447 --> 01:23:38.479
- Green skin.
- No skin.

01:23:38.481 --> 01:23:39.880
- Prickly.
- Brainy.

01:23:45.556 --> 01:23:46.858
I'm sorry.

01:23:53.730 --> 01:23:55.731
Ew.

01:23:55.733 --> 01:23:57.869
You are amazing.

01:24:08.545 --> 01:24:11.349
Look at me, Dennis.
Look at me.

01:24:12.582 --> 01:24:15.349
Come on,
you can't deny it.

01:24:15.351 --> 01:24:17.421
No! I'm too young
to Zing!

01:24:22.359 --> 01:24:24.558
Well, I feel
kind of silly now.

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:28.397
Heh. For decades
I have hunted your kind,

01:24:28.399 --> 01:24:29.997
persecuted you.

01:24:33.037 --> 01:24:36.240
The only thing I can do
to make it up to you is

01:24:37.474 --> 01:24:38.773
give you

01:24:40.043 --> 01:24:42.044
a 30% refund.

01:24:42.046 --> 01:24:44.548
Preposterous!

01:24:45.916 --> 01:24:47.749
Oh, all right.

01:24:47.751 --> 01:24:48.950
Full refund.

01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:22.483
Wayne, Wanda,
what happened to you guys?

01:25:22.485 --> 01:25:25.086
Yeah, we, like,
hardly saw you on the cruise.

01:25:25.088 --> 01:25:27.388
Yeah, I know.

01:25:27.390 --> 01:25:29.357
We got tranquilized and spent most
of the trip locked in a closet.

01:25:29.359 --> 01:25:32.063
We're gonna book it
again for the holidays.

01:25:38.068 --> 01:25:39.567
Hi. Checking in?

01:25:39.569 --> 01:25:41.603
Yes. Thank you.

01:25:41.605 --> 01:25:44.485
Great. I have a room all ready for you.

01:25:45.408 --> 01:25:47.576
Hey, buddy, would you mind?

01:25:47.578 --> 01:25:48.978
Sure thing, pal.

01:26:04.528 --> 01:26:08.429
Okay, what's going on,
sneaky pants?

01:26:08.431 --> 01:26:10.464
Oh, nothing.

01:26:10.466 --> 01:26:14.671
It's just, I wanted to make
sure nobody would bother us.

01:26:15.506 --> 01:26:17.104
Oh! Why?

01:26:17.106 --> 01:26:19.774
Are you going to suck-a my blood?
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

01:26:21.677 --> 01:26:23.478
No.
