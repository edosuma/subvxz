00:01.102 --> 00:01.235
.

00:02.270 --> 00:03.104
A nurse from Chicago Med.
Raped, beaten.

00:04.004 --> 00:05.139
Perp torched the joint.

00:05.173 --> 00:06.574
There's just too many
similarities

00:06.607 --> 00:08.509
to a case that I worked
10 years back.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.144
I'm on the next plane
to Chicago.

00:10.178 --> 00:11.745
Witnesses were consistent.

00:11.779 --> 00:14.315
They all saw a man
in medical clothing.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.117
What brings you to Chicago,
Mr. Yates?

00:16.150 --> 00:17.485
My job as a physician,

00:17.518 --> 00:19.520
there's always a spot to fill.

00:21.922 --> 00:24.125
(Lindsay)
He's playing a game,
and we'll get him.

00:24.158 --> 00:25.493
Chicago PD!

00:25.526 --> 00:26.527
He was just here.

00:28.062 --> 00:29.397
Hello.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.507
(male narrator)
In the criminal justice system,

00:39.540 --> 00:43.177
sexually-based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:43.211 --> 00:45.579
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:45.613 --> 00:47.415
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:47.448 --> 00:48.649
are members of an elite squad

00:48.682 --> 00:50.951
known as
the special victims unit.

00:50.984 --> 00:52.720
These are their stories.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.555
[dramatic clang]

00:54.588 --> 00:56.524
That son of a bitch is
toying with us.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.292
Well, he knew we were
tracking his phone.

00:58.326 --> 01:02.196
He left it in the basement next
to a lighter and nail polish.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.298
Hey.
Fin, Ruzek, and Amaro are still

01:04.332 --> 01:05.733
tearing the house apart.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.135
(Halstead)
We had eyes on him
less than an hour ago.

01:07.168 --> 01:08.802
He couldn't have gone far.
We have alerts on his car,

01:08.836 --> 01:10.138
his I-Pass, his credit cards--

01:10.171 --> 01:12.039
Look, everybody is in on this.

01:12.140 --> 01:15.543
Have Nadia set up
a civilian hotline.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.011
Where is she?
Where's Nadia?

01:21.014 --> 01:23.917
She had to run an errand.

01:23.951 --> 01:24.985
She borrowed your car.

01:25.018 --> 01:26.520
An errand?

01:28.055 --> 01:29.857
She went to pick up
your birthday cake.

01:29.890 --> 01:32.660
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.828
Straight to voicemail.

01:45.005 --> 01:49.076
[man singing with radio]
* The good times start now

01:49.177 --> 01:53.414
- * Without dollar one...
- [woman mumbling]

01:53.447 --> 01:59.019
* But how much, baby,
do I really need *

01:59.052 --> 02:01.222
- [humming]
[volume increases]

02:01.255 --> 02:05.092
* Cheer up, sleepy Jean

02:05.193 --> 02:08.196
- * Oh, what can it mean
- [muffed screams]

02:08.196 --> 02:11.765
* To a daydream believer

02:11.799 --> 02:13.000
* And a...

02:13.033 --> 02:15.903
[Muzak plays in background]

02:15.936 --> 02:20.941
*

02:20.974 --> 02:23.344
Oh, let me give you a hand
with that.

02:23.377 --> 02:26.013
It looks like you
got your arms full already.

02:26.046 --> 02:27.981
You're a peach.

02:28.015 --> 02:30.418
[chuckles]

02:30.451 --> 02:31.852
Look at you!

02:31.885 --> 02:34.388
[giggles]

02:34.422 --> 02:36.957
Pick Your Poison.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.226
Come again?

02:38.259 --> 02:39.627
That's what it's called.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.430
All the polishes
have silly names.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.732
- She'll love it.
- Mm-hmm.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.345
Evening.
Is that your car?

02:57.378 --> 02:59.280
Is there a problem?

02:59.313 --> 03:01.615
Yeah, there's something
moving around in the back.

03:01.649 --> 03:04.385
Oh, good, she's still alive.

03:04.418 --> 03:06.587
Don't you just hate it
when you kidnap a girl,

03:06.620 --> 03:09.390
and she won't stop
kicking the back of your seat?

03:09.423 --> 03:11.259
It's my dog, man.

03:11.259 --> 03:13.294
- Oh.
[both laughing]

03:13.327 --> 03:16.930
Yeah, my dog hates it
when I lock her in the car too.

03:16.964 --> 03:19.500
- You have a good evening now.
- All right, cheers.

03:30.978 --> 03:36.917
[muffled whimpers]

03:36.950 --> 03:38.819
I said lie still

03:38.852 --> 03:41.989
or I will knock
you clear out, got it?

03:43.291 --> 03:45.293
[coughing]

03:46.627 --> 03:49.096
Is that a yes?

03:49.129 --> 03:51.632
They're gonna find you.

03:51.665 --> 03:52.766
Please let me go.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.735
Now? Come on.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.137
We are on our honeymoon.

03:57.170 --> 04:01.842
This is paradise compared
to what's coming.

04:01.875 --> 04:05.713
Nadia, you ever
seen New York?

04:05.746 --> 04:08.316
It is the epicenter
of the world.

04:08.316 --> 04:11.719
We are gonna have a field day,
the two of us.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.888
Please, I--I won't tell them
that it was you.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.390
You missed your chance.

04:16.424 --> 04:21.161
See, a nice trucker,
he heard you kicking.

04:21.194 --> 04:23.331
In fact, oh, look at that,

04:23.331 --> 04:26.199
he's still outside.

04:26.233 --> 04:30.904
If you'd only been
just a little bit louder.

04:30.938 --> 04:34.074
Help! Please!
Somebody help me! Please!

04:34.107 --> 04:35.943
[laughing]
It's too late for that now.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.746
Hey, we've got a long drive
ahead of us.

04:38.779 --> 04:42.082
Why don't you start by telling
me something about yourself?

04:42.115 --> 04:44.051
[music plays loudly]
Please...help me!

04:44.084 --> 04:45.653
Somebody help me!

04:45.686 --> 04:48.656
[Daydream Believer
continues playing]

04:52.660 --> 04:55.228
All right,
tell me you got something.

04:55.262 --> 04:57.197
We found Yates' car parked
across from the district.

04:57.230 --> 05:00.568
CSU's tearing it apart,
and there was...

05:02.436 --> 05:03.937
What?

05:03.971 --> 05:06.940
A smashed birthday cake
on the ground.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.275
No other sign of Nadia.

05:08.376 --> 05:10.243
Okay, he snatched her
right off the street.

05:10.277 --> 05:12.913
- There's got to be witnesses.
- Patrol's still canvassing.

05:12.946 --> 05:16.950
Also checking on traffic
and security cams.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.552
This is not on you.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.388
She went to get
my birthday cake.

05:20.421 --> 05:23.056
She went outside
because of me.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.758
We don't know anything
for sure.

05:24.792 --> 05:27.528
We know she didn't just
take off, Jay.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.763
She's in trouble.
We've got to find her.

05:29.797 --> 05:32.032
[phone buzzes]
Here we go.

05:32.065 --> 05:35.102
All right, let's just
not panic until we know.

05:35.135 --> 05:36.870
Hey, we know.

05:36.904 --> 05:37.971
He has her.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.740
Thanks.
Guys,

05:39.773 --> 05:41.041
we may have a hit
on Lindsay's plates.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.476
East Side headed
towards Calumet Park.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.712
- Did they stop the car?
- Lost it in traffic.

05:44.745 --> 05:47.214
Reported a man driving
and a woman in the front seat.

05:47.247 --> 05:49.717
Come on, let's go.

05:49.750 --> 05:53.487
[sirens]

06:00.428 --> 06:01.629
[police radio chatter]

06:01.662 --> 06:03.664
Get out of the car,
Yates.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.332
Hands up!

06:05.433 --> 06:07.535
- Suspect's emerging.
- Nice and slow, buddy.

06:07.568 --> 06:10.103
Nice and slow.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.039
(man)
What the hell?

06:12.072 --> 06:14.041
Hey, hey, don't shoot.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.809
- Get down.
- It's okay--just get down.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.711
- Don't shoot!
- It's okay.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.580
The son of a bitch
switched the plates.

06:19.613 --> 06:22.850
- Got a mom and two kids.
- Otherwise the vehicle's clear.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.752
Sir, where are you
coming from?

06:24.785 --> 06:26.454
Uh...Pennsylvania.

06:26.454 --> 06:28.021
My mother-in-law's.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.791
Okay, when was the last time
you stopped?

06:30.824 --> 06:33.193
A rest stop in Indiana
for dinner.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.228
Outside Elkhart.

06:35.262 --> 06:37.831
Oh, my God.

06:48.476 --> 06:51.479
[dramatic music]

07:34.555 --> 07:34.688
.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.324
Fin and Amaro filled me in.
He's still driving

07:38.526 --> 07:40.260
- Lindsay's car?
- We think so.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.629
He's smart.
Taking back roads.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.531
Avoiding tolls.

07:43.564 --> 07:44.998
Okay, what's the timeline?

07:45.032 --> 07:47.367
(Voight)
Nadia's cell goes dead
around 5:00 in Chicago.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.537
Two hours later, he
swapped plates at a gas station

07:49.570 --> 07:50.871
near Elkhart, Indiana.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.873
And you think
that he's headed here?

07:52.906 --> 07:54.708
Well, the second switch

07:54.742 --> 07:59.547
is at a parking lot just east
of Reynoldsville, Pennsylvania.

07:59.547 --> 08:01.749
And New York
is his old stomping ground.

08:01.782 --> 08:04.585
(Voight)
He used to be somebody
when he was there.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.987
Yeah, so he could be here
by early morning.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.557
- You put out alerts?
- Yeah, his photo, hers too.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.258
Flagged both their credit cards.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.627
Also checking for stolen cards
along the way.

08:13.661 --> 08:16.063
Okay, as soon as you can
confirm his new license plate,

08:16.096 --> 08:17.631
we'll broadcast it.

08:17.665 --> 08:20.167
Your guys, Lindsay, and I
are on the next flight out.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.370
Hopefully we get there
before he does.

08:23.403 --> 08:26.139
Look, Olivia,
just something else...

08:26.173 --> 08:28.108
Nadia...

08:31.779 --> 08:33.847
She's a good kid.

08:33.881 --> 08:37.017
So I've heard.

08:37.050 --> 08:40.954
And we know what
he's doing to her.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.956
Don't go there.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.425
That never helps.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.329
Yeah, I know.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.771
[drill whirrs]

09:02.876 --> 09:04.812
We made pretty good time.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.814
Looks like we'll get there
about dawn.

09:06.847 --> 09:10.718
You ever see the sun rise
over the East River?

09:10.751 --> 09:14.421
Nod your head. Yes? No?

09:19.126 --> 09:20.794
Let me go.

09:20.828 --> 09:23.931
Oh, all the girls say that.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.099
"Please don't kill me.

09:26.133 --> 09:29.402
I'll do whatever you want."

09:29.436 --> 09:31.705
Pretty soon

09:31.739 --> 09:33.140
you'll beg for your life.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.075
And a little secret:

09:35.108 --> 09:39.479
towards the end...
you'll cry for your mama.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.048
Not me.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.050
Oh, you will.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.752
You know what's
gonna happen to you?

09:44.785 --> 09:46.654
[laughs]

09:46.654 --> 09:48.856
You're a funny girl.

09:48.889 --> 09:53.560
If you kill me, Hank Voight
is gonna track you down

09:53.661 --> 09:56.196
and make you wish
you'd never been born.

09:57.665 --> 09:59.967
Enough small talk for now.

10:03.503 --> 10:04.838
[muffled grunt]

10:08.108 --> 10:11.712
Okay, Chicago PD's flight
finally landed at LaGuardia.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.313
- What can I tell Voight?
- We got a hit

10:13.346 --> 10:15.382
from a stolen credit card
used to buy gas,

10:15.415 --> 10:16.884
an ice pick,
and a shovel.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.952
It was off of route 78
near Plainfield, New Jersey.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.654
They're getting close.
We've got local police

10:20.688 --> 10:21.822
getting an ID
from the clerk now.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.691
There's no hits
on the last known plates,

10:23.724 --> 10:25.225
so he might have
switched them again.

10:25.258 --> 10:26.694
Still, he's got to take
a tunnel or a bridge

10:26.727 --> 10:28.261
to get into Manhattan.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.163
He's driving the most
common car on the road.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.932
So what, are we gonna
stop every silver Camry?

10:31.965 --> 10:34.034
We're gonna stop every one
driven by a male, white,

10:34.067 --> 10:36.503
that fits Yates' description
and check every known location

10:36.536 --> 10:38.772
that Yates frequented
when he lived here.

10:38.806 --> 10:41.875
Hey, Sergeant, we may have
a hit on Lindsay's car.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.643
It's south
of the Broadway Bridge.

10:43.677 --> 10:45.245
Let's go.

10:48.716 --> 10:49.950
(Voight)
All right, what have we got?

10:49.983 --> 10:51.284
We just got here.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.986
(Rollins)
The sanitation truck
spotted it.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.355
I mean,
it's not exactly public parking.

10:55.388 --> 10:56.957
(Lindsay)
It's mine.

10:59.192 --> 11:00.794
(Amaro)
Locked.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.752
Nothing. No body.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.266
I gave her
that scarf.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.434
She left it for us
to find.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.536
So she could still be alive.

11:46.940 --> 11:50.844
Okay, there's no way
he walked out of here, okay?

11:50.878 --> 11:53.413
We're gonna get more units,
canines, cadets,

11:53.446 --> 11:57.785
check to see if there's
any reports of stolen vehicles.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.619
We're gonna get him.

12:10.297 --> 12:13.400
Yep.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.568
Yeah, I'm there.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.408
Okay. Yeah.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.281
Yeah, yeah.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.687
Need help with that?

12:34.721 --> 12:36.723
Oh, thank you.

12:36.824 --> 12:38.425
Sure.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.883
(woman)
Oh, my God!

13:02.916 --> 13:04.117
Oh, my God!

13:22.903 --> 13:23.036
.

13:24.737 --> 13:26.439
[police radio chatter]

13:26.473 --> 13:27.174
- Was it Yates?
- Could have been.

13:27.941 --> 13:28.976
There was two vics.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.544
One DOA, a slender brunette
with long hair.

13:31.578 --> 13:32.980
- Is the other one Nadia?
- No.

13:33.013 --> 13:35.248
It was a flight attendant
sharing an apartment.

13:35.282 --> 13:38.551
Brutally beaten.
He left behind a sap.

13:38.585 --> 13:41.088
Cracked their skulls.
Both sexually assaulted.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.490
- She's a witness?
- Not to the crime.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.892
The perp helped her
with her bags

13:44.892 --> 13:45.893
as he left the courtyard.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.394
- Time?
- About half an hour ago.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.329
Her apartment's
across from the girls.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.231
The door was ajar.
She called it in.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.000
- Do you mind if I help?
- Of course.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.367
Listen, CSU's upstairs.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.736
Yeah.
I need to see for myself.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.240
(woman)
This is a nightmare.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.075
They were so young.

14:02.109 --> 14:04.444
Ma'am, you said that the man
you saw

14:04.477 --> 14:06.313
was white in his 40s.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.381
Any of these guys?

14:09.482 --> 14:11.318
Him, maybe, or...him.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.520
Did you see which way
he went?

14:13.553 --> 14:15.422
Was he on foot?
Did he get into a car?

14:15.455 --> 14:18.258
I just remember
he had the nicest smile.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.227
Okay,
thank you, ma'am.

14:20.260 --> 14:23.796
If he did this to these two,
where the hell is Nadia?

14:23.830 --> 14:26.299
- Did she ID him?
(Carisi) Sort of.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.501
- Not much else though.
(Rollins) Okay, it's 30 minutes.

14:28.535 --> 14:29.602
He could have hopped
on the subway.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.338
He could have stolen
another car.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.440
Or there's a reason
that he's in this neighborhood.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.308
Find out if there's anything
from his past

14:35.342 --> 14:37.510
that ties him to Elmhurst.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.030
I'm gonna kill this animal.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.298
Okay, any sign
of forced entry?

14:58.331 --> 15:01.301
So he charmed his way in.
That's his MO.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.869
Yes and no.
Leaving the door open,

15:02.970 --> 15:04.404
the bodies in situ,
the weapon--

15:04.437 --> 15:06.706
- Your point?
- He's decompensating.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.376
He's getting sloppy or he knows
we're closing in on him,

15:09.409 --> 15:11.144
- and this is his final spree.
- Hey, Sarge,

15:11.178 --> 15:14.514
Yates got a parking ticket back
in 2004, three blocks from here.

15:14.547 --> 15:15.815
Fin and Amaro
are on the way.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.350
Okay, flood the zone.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.156
(Fin)
Unis canvassed the block.

15:23.190 --> 15:25.993
Neighbors saw a male, white,
Yates' age and height,

15:25.993 --> 15:28.095
follow a woman into this house.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.696
Hit it.

15:29.729 --> 15:31.198
NYPD!

15:31.231 --> 15:32.832
Everybody down.

15:32.865 --> 15:34.501
You can't just come in here
like that.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.536
- What's going on?
- Where is she?

15:36.569 --> 15:38.738
She? Who?
What is this about?

15:40.773 --> 15:42.909
- Ma'am--ma'am!
- Where's Nadia?

15:43.010 --> 15:44.377
I don't know.

15:44.411 --> 15:45.912
Sergeant, back off,
we got him.

15:46.013 --> 15:48.915
Back off.
Turn around.

15:49.016 --> 15:50.383
- Ma'am, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.085
We're having lunch.
What is this?

15:52.119 --> 15:53.720
- You know this guy?
- Greg?

15:53.753 --> 15:55.222
He's my fiancé.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.194
Come on.

16:01.228 --> 16:02.595
- Hey.
- You got him?

16:02.629 --> 16:05.032
- Where is he?
- He's in with Rollins.

16:05.032 --> 16:07.167
He still hasn't told us
where Nadia is?

16:07.200 --> 16:10.470
Nope. We could use a bad cop
in there.

16:10.503 --> 16:13.040
I don't know what
happened to Nadia.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.641
You don't know?
You kidnapped her.

16:14.674 --> 16:17.510
Kidnapped?
No, she offered me a ride.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.779
Have you really not heard
from her?

16:19.812 --> 16:21.514
No wonder
you're so worried.

16:21.548 --> 16:24.217
Cut the crap.
Where is she?

16:24.251 --> 16:26.186
Dr. Yates,

16:26.219 --> 16:27.854
tell me how you and Nadia...

16:27.887 --> 16:29.189
Hooked up?

16:29.222 --> 16:33.060
Well, I was a bit on edge.

16:33.093 --> 16:36.229
I knew the Chicago cops
were after me.

16:36.263 --> 16:38.431
I thought
I should visit the station,

16:38.465 --> 16:40.500
maybe clear the air,

16:40.533 --> 16:44.371
but I met Nadia there and she
thought that was a bad idea.

16:44.404 --> 16:48.075
Mm-hmm, and she, uh,
she offered you a ride?

16:48.108 --> 16:50.077
Yes, she said
she needed to get out of town,

16:50.077 --> 16:52.512
but she didn't want
to drive alone.

16:52.545 --> 16:55.115
I don't know,
I just went with it.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.919
From what I know about you,
you don't really act on impulse.

16:59.952 --> 17:02.422
As a surgeon, right,
you can't.

17:02.455 --> 17:05.492
You have to be methodical,
thoughtful.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.261
Is this an interrogation
or a date?

17:08.295 --> 17:10.930
- She's getting him to talk.
- He's jerking her around.

17:10.963 --> 17:12.599
Give her some time.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.201
He's been getting away
with this for 20 years.

17:14.234 --> 17:17.470
And he's not gonna cave.
The girlfriend.

17:17.504 --> 17:21.141
Greg and I have been involved
on and off for 19 years.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.810
We met while he
was at medical school.

17:23.843 --> 17:26.846
(Amaro) Right, at Duke.
- Yes, I was a freshman.

17:26.879 --> 17:29.649
We moved
to New York together.

17:29.682 --> 17:30.717
That's a long time.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.652
When did you two
get engaged?

17:32.685 --> 17:35.255
Just today, actually.

17:35.288 --> 17:38.458
He never wanted to commit.
He's a bit of a rolling stone,

17:38.491 --> 17:39.726
but that kind of worked
for me too.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.461
(Lindsay)
Did you ever live together?

17:41.494 --> 17:43.930
No, I guess we
both needed our space.

17:43.963 --> 17:45.998
Did you ever wonder
why he needed his space?

17:46.032 --> 17:48.668
He's a doctor.
He's busy with his practice.

17:48.701 --> 17:50.170
He needs to unwind.

17:50.203 --> 17:53.173
He likes to take hikes.
He rides his bike.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.541
- He goes rock climbing.
- Susie...

17:54.574 --> 17:59.179
Greg Yates
is not who you think he is.

17:59.212 --> 18:04.151
Look, these girls
went missing at Duke,

18:04.151 --> 18:05.452
in New York,

18:05.485 --> 18:08.621
New Orleans, Chicago.

18:08.655 --> 18:11.391
Girls who were raped,

18:11.424 --> 18:13.626
bludgeoned,

18:13.660 --> 18:15.962
burned.

18:15.995 --> 18:19.766
All while Greg was living
in those cities.

18:19.799 --> 18:23.069
Nadia looked at me
like a father figure.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.172
She said she couldn't deal
with the responsibility

18:25.172 --> 18:27.174
of being everyone's
good girl,

18:27.174 --> 18:29.742
that she needed
to spread her wings.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.378
Dr. Yates, you were
the last one with her.

18:31.411 --> 18:34.814
You knew her mindset.

18:34.847 --> 18:37.817
What do you think
happened to her?

18:37.850 --> 18:41.188
A pretty girl like that
looking to party in New York?

18:41.188 --> 18:42.355
I mean,
it kind of depends on

18:42.389 --> 18:46.193
who she fell in with,
doesn't it?

18:46.193 --> 18:49.028
I mean, where...

18:49.061 --> 18:51.998
do you think
this person would take her?

18:53.666 --> 18:57.570
Oh, um...

18:57.604 --> 19:01.641
well, he would probably
take her to a remote location

19:01.674 --> 19:06.713
where he could do
whatever he wanted to her.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.748
And after that?

19:08.781 --> 19:13.220
Maybe he would take her body
to a special place.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.422
A sacred place.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.390
A place where
he could visit her

19:17.424 --> 19:20.593
every once in a while.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.729
Maybe...

19:22.762 --> 19:25.097
defile her again,
you know.

19:25.131 --> 19:28.801
I can't imagine what you're
going through right now.

19:28.835 --> 19:33.139
It must be horrible thinking
about Nadia's last moments,

19:33.240 --> 19:36.276
how she must have suffered.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.144
Your lives must be a living hell

19:38.245 --> 19:43.816
wondering if you're ever even
going to find the body.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.752
I'm going in.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.954
Just let Amanda do her job.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.358
No, no,
that is just not possible.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.092
This is where he was
right before

19:53.125 --> 19:55.495
he came to your apartment.
Look at it.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.297
He bludgeoned this girl
to death,

19:57.330 --> 19:59.031
and that one's brain damaged.

19:59.065 --> 20:01.334
- You're lying to me.
- Am I?

20:01.368 --> 20:03.503
Susie, why do you think
I'm here?

20:03.536 --> 20:06.673
He kidnapped a girl in Chicago,
and we tracked him here.

20:06.706 --> 20:07.974
No.

20:10.042 --> 20:13.280
Nadia.
He has her.

20:13.313 --> 20:16.048
She's my friend.

20:16.082 --> 20:18.451
On the drive here,

20:18.485 --> 20:20.520
he bought an ice pick

20:20.553 --> 20:24.691
and a shovel at a rest stop
with a stolen credit card.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.126
- Here.
- We found this in his car

20:27.159 --> 20:29.161
along with
her blood and his DNA.

20:29.195 --> 20:31.531
Now I know you're lying.
He was at the beach.

20:31.564 --> 20:35.167
A special place he likes to go.
He told me so.

20:35.201 --> 20:38.705
He had sand in his shoes.
That's why I asked him about it.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.773
He said he had gone there
to mediate.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.809
He decided he was going
to ask me to marry him

20:42.842 --> 20:45.111
while sitting on that beach.

20:45.144 --> 20:47.580
What beach, Susie?

20:54.086 --> 20:56.856
[police radio chatter]

21:01.928 --> 21:03.863
Susie said Yates sometimes
took her to the main beach

21:03.896 --> 21:05.231
in the summers.

21:05.332 --> 21:07.334
There's no bodies out here.
Too public.

21:07.334 --> 21:09.101
You're right, this place
is mobbed in the summer.

21:09.135 --> 21:10.770
Yates did speculate
that the killer

21:10.803 --> 21:12.104
liked to come back and visit.

21:12.138 --> 21:15.041
Maybe they're both
playing us.

21:15.074 --> 21:17.644
Someplace sacred.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.346
Search the woods.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.821
- Hey.
- Was it her?

21:28.855 --> 21:32.959
No, some old bones, a skull.

21:32.992 --> 21:36.429
(Rollins)
We got thigh bones,
pelvic bones, a hand--

21:36.463 --> 21:38.998
- All complete decomp.
- They've been there for years.

21:39.031 --> 21:40.767
My God.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.201
(Halstead)
Hey, Sarge.

21:46.939 --> 21:48.941
We got her.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.484
I'm sorry.

22:05.492 --> 22:07.927
No...

22:29.449 --> 22:29.582
.

22:32.585 --> 22:33.085
- Nadia Decotis.
- Yeah.

22:34.921 --> 22:37.223
She's the one
you worked with?

22:37.256 --> 22:38.425
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

22:38.425 --> 22:40.026
She was raped and tortured
and killed

22:40.059 --> 22:42.529
in a car that Yates
dumped in Upper Manhattan.

22:42.562 --> 22:44.597
He must have
stolen another car

22:44.631 --> 22:47.934
to transport her
to his burial ground.

22:47.967 --> 22:50.236
Burial ground?
How many others?

22:50.269 --> 22:52.672
Seven remains so far--they're
working through the night.

22:52.705 --> 22:55.675
- They're still digging.
- The bodies have been there

22:55.708 --> 22:58.611
for years.
It's down to skulls and bones.

22:58.645 --> 23:00.447
We're looking at
dental records.

23:00.447 --> 23:02.048
Two hits so far.

23:02.081 --> 23:03.149
No forensics?
Nothing to tie him

23:03.182 --> 23:05.718
- to any of them?
- No. Yates usually

23:05.752 --> 23:08.721
chooses his victims
at random, okay?

23:08.755 --> 23:11.691
He either burned the bodies
or he buried them.

23:11.724 --> 23:12.892
He never left evidence.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.727
Not even with the two vics
in Queens?

23:14.761 --> 23:16.929
There's no blood from them
on his clothes or on his body.

23:16.963 --> 23:20.266
He must have changed
his clothes, washed himself.

23:20.299 --> 23:22.469
None of his DNA
is in their apartment.

23:22.469 --> 23:24.571
Can the vic
who survived ID him?

23:24.604 --> 23:26.372
Brain damage.

23:30.109 --> 23:32.679
I got a State's Attorney
standing by in Chicago.

23:32.712 --> 23:35.214
We can try Yates
for his last two victims there.

23:35.247 --> 23:39.886
You mean the one he burned,
along with any evidence?

23:39.919 --> 23:41.287
Or the one
who apparently died

23:41.320 --> 23:42.922
while Yates
was walking in the park

23:42.955 --> 23:44.524
with one of your detectives,

23:44.557 --> 23:46.493
along with your whole squad
there to alibi him.

23:46.493 --> 23:48.695
Hold on, Barba.
This might be something.

23:48.728 --> 23:51.498
Nadia Decotis was not random.

23:51.498 --> 23:54.701
This was a screw you
to Chicago PD.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.035
Do we even have any evidence

23:56.068 --> 23:57.537
that puts Yates
in the car with her?

23:57.570 --> 23:58.938
Yes.
We have forensics,

23:58.971 --> 24:00.773
and we have footage
of him driving.

24:00.807 --> 24:03.275
Not to mention he admits it.

24:03.309 --> 24:07.046
She's our best case,
Nadia Decotis.

24:12.151 --> 24:15.221
Nadia Decotis would be
horrified to find me on trial

24:15.254 --> 24:16.623
for her murder.

24:16.656 --> 24:18.525
She was someone
I grew close to.

24:18.525 --> 24:19.692
- Is there a point this?
- Yes.

24:19.726 --> 24:21.393
In light of the serious charges
I'm facing,

24:21.427 --> 24:22.995
I've decided
it's in my best interest

24:23.029 --> 24:24.230
to represent myself.

24:24.263 --> 24:25.632
Dr. Yates, are you sure?

24:25.665 --> 24:27.299
You are entitled
to competent counsel,

24:27.333 --> 24:29.602
and Ms. Crane
is an experienced attorney.

24:29.636 --> 24:31.103
She is,
but with all due respect,

24:31.137 --> 24:33.573
it's my life at stake,
not hers.

24:33.606 --> 24:35.542
Very well.
Trial will proceed

24:35.542 --> 24:38.645
with Ms. Crane
staying on as co-counsel.

24:43.950 --> 24:47.820
As those autopsy
and crime scene photos show,

24:47.854 --> 24:51.591
Nadia Decotis had been struck
repeatedly by a heavy object

24:51.624 --> 24:52.959
in the head and chest,

24:52.992 --> 24:55.628
suffering
traumatic wounds pre-mortem.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.564
She was then strangled.

24:57.564 --> 25:00.132
There are also ligature marks
on her wrist and ankles

25:00.166 --> 25:02.569
indicating she had been bound.

25:02.602 --> 25:05.204
Were there any signs
of sexual assault?

25:05.237 --> 25:07.974
Wounds and tears to her vagina
and rectum

25:08.007 --> 25:10.409
indicating violent
penetration.

25:10.442 --> 25:13.012
I see, thank you.

25:16.348 --> 25:19.986
Doctor, forgive me,
I am new at this.

25:20.019 --> 25:23.055
But those wounds
of the vagina and rectum,

25:23.089 --> 25:24.757
are those the kinds of things

25:24.791 --> 25:27.594
you might see in the body
of an active prostitute?

25:29.862 --> 25:32.699
- To some extent, but not--
- To some extent.

25:32.732 --> 25:34.266
Nothing further.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.736
(Lindsay)
Nadia loved her job.

25:36.769 --> 25:38.871
She had really turned
her life around.

25:38.905 --> 25:42.609
She was studying criminology
to become a police officer.

25:42.609 --> 25:44.510
- That was her dream.
- Her dream.

25:44.611 --> 25:46.345
Did she ever tell you
she wanted to throw it away

25:46.378 --> 25:48.514
- and move to New York?
- Absolutely not.

25:48.615 --> 25:51.183
When she disappeared, I knew
something had happened to her.

25:51.217 --> 25:54.086
Objection. What the witness
thinks she knows

25:54.120 --> 25:56.288
can't be evidence, can it?

25:56.322 --> 25:58.625
Sustained.

25:58.625 --> 26:02.328
Detective Lindsay, when did
you next see Ms. Decotis?

26:02.361 --> 26:05.698
When we found her body
in a shallow grave.

26:05.732 --> 26:08.701
So something
had happened to her.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.302
I'm very sorry.

26:15.207 --> 26:17.844
Detective Lindsay,
did you meet Ms. Decotis

26:17.877 --> 26:20.346
through friends,
at a party,

26:20.379 --> 26:22.849
a police benefit
for widows and orphans--

26:22.882 --> 26:25.718
- Your Honor--
- Ask your question, Dr. Yates.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.854
Well,
how did you meet Ms. Decotis?

26:27.887 --> 26:29.889
I arrested her.

26:29.922 --> 26:33.993
For what?

26:34.026 --> 26:36.863
She was working
as an escort.

26:36.896 --> 26:38.931
As a prostitute.

26:38.965 --> 26:40.199
Was she on drugs?

26:44.203 --> 26:47.273
She was addicted to heroin
when I arrested her.

26:47.306 --> 26:51.711
She really struggled for a time,
but when she was ready,

26:51.744 --> 26:55.381
she called me,
and I brought her to rehab.

26:55.414 --> 26:58.450
She had been clean
and sober ever since.

26:58.484 --> 27:01.420
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

27:01.453 --> 27:03.189
We became roommates.

27:03.222 --> 27:05.692
I saw her every day
for a year.

27:05.692 --> 27:09.328
You sound very committed
to her recovery.

27:09.361 --> 27:11.230
I can see how
you'd hate to think

27:11.263 --> 27:12.932
that your little rescue
project failed.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.701
- Objection.
- Sustained.

27:14.701 --> 27:17.704
- You're done, Dr. Yates.
- Okeydoke.

27:21.373 --> 27:23.943
I tried my best,
but he just made her sound--

27:23.976 --> 27:26.112
Erin, it's not on you.

27:26.145 --> 27:29.581
You just gonna let him get away
with smearing Nadia like that?

27:29.615 --> 27:31.417
There's a limit
to how far he can go.

27:31.450 --> 27:32.719
When he exceeds it,
I'll object.

27:32.752 --> 27:34.353
- You'll object?
- Is there a problem?

27:34.386 --> 27:35.988
There shouldn't be.

27:36.022 --> 27:37.924
He's a murderer
and a rapist.

27:37.957 --> 27:39.726
We all know that,
but no offense

27:39.759 --> 27:43.029
to your legal acumen, the jury
isn't privy to what we know.

27:43.062 --> 27:44.731
They all see
the same charming man

27:44.731 --> 27:46.733
whose smile lured dozens
of women to their deaths.

27:46.733 --> 27:48.735
Liv, we need to prep.
This is going to be hard on you.

27:48.735 --> 27:50.803
I'm fine, we went over it.
Just give me a second, okay?

27:50.837 --> 27:54.874
Hey, maybe you don't want
to be in there.

28:06.786 --> 28:06.886
.

28:08.420 --> 28:09.255
A forensic exam found DNA
from Ms. Decotis

28:11.157 --> 28:14.326
and from the defendant
in Detective Lindsay's car.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.395
There was also blood
from Ms. Decotis.

28:16.428 --> 28:19.766
When you questioned
the defendant about that car,

28:19.766 --> 28:21.801
- what did he say?
- He claimed that Ms. Decotis

28:21.834 --> 28:25.304
invited him to drive
with her here from Chicago.

28:25.337 --> 28:26.572
Did he offer
any explanation

28:26.605 --> 28:27.974
for the presence of her blood
in her car?

28:28.007 --> 28:29.776
No, he did not.

28:29.776 --> 28:34.781
He did, however, say he was sure
that she must have suffered.

28:36.783 --> 28:38.918
No doubt.

28:38.951 --> 28:40.452
Thank you, Sergeant Benson.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.458
You don't like me,
do you, Sergeant?

28:46.492 --> 28:48.027
- Objection. Relevance.
- Sustained.

28:48.060 --> 28:51.663
Dr. Yates, confine
your questions to the case.

28:51.697 --> 28:54.200
Okay, the case.

28:54.233 --> 28:57.136
Sergeant Benson,
you recently went to Chicago

28:57.169 --> 29:01.040
to investigate another rape,
murder, and arson, didn't you?

29:01.073 --> 29:03.009
Yes, I did.

29:03.042 --> 29:06.178
A murder similar to a case
of yours from a dozen years ago

29:06.212 --> 29:08.547
- in New York?
- That's correct.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.917
And you were looking
for one suspect

29:10.950 --> 29:12.418
in both of these murders.

29:12.451 --> 29:15.454
Yes.
You were that suspect.

29:15.487 --> 29:18.825
You say that today, Sergeant,

29:18.858 --> 29:20.626
but before I was arrested,

29:20.659 --> 29:25.364
you had another suspect
in mind, didn't you?

29:25.397 --> 29:27.166
I was consulting
with Chicago PD.

29:27.199 --> 29:29.635
We were pursuing
many leads.

29:29.668 --> 29:33.272
Oh, I see, and...
from your investigative notes,

29:33.305 --> 29:36.742
was one of these leads
a Dr. Will Halstead?

29:38.144 --> 29:40.612
His name did come up.

29:40.646 --> 29:44.851
Really? Well, why did SVU
speak with him?

29:44.851 --> 29:48.454
Because he knew another woman
who had gone missing.

29:48.487 --> 29:51.090
And did you suspect
that the murderer

29:51.123 --> 29:54.493
you were looking for
was involved in that case?

29:54.526 --> 29:55.895
Yes.

29:55.928 --> 30:00.432
And then, Dr. Halstead
shows up in Chicago

30:00.466 --> 30:01.834
right before that murder.

30:01.868 --> 30:05.004
He even works in the same
hospital as the Chicago victim.

30:05.037 --> 30:08.875
Yes, that's why I went
and spoke with Dr. Halstead.

30:08.908 --> 30:11.210
He was ruled out by
an alibi.

30:11.243 --> 30:15.447
I see, and that alibi
was confirmed, not by you,

30:15.481 --> 30:18.885
but by the Intelligence Unit
of the Chicago police,

30:18.918 --> 30:20.752
isn't that right?

30:20.786 --> 30:21.787
Yes.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.422
A unit of the Chicago police

30:23.455 --> 30:25.858
that includes
Detective Jay Halstead,

30:25.892 --> 30:30.796
who just happens to be the
brother of Dr. Will Halstead.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.899
Yes.

30:35.267 --> 30:37.136
The suspect's brother
conveniently cleared

30:37.169 --> 30:39.371
your prime suspect,

30:39.405 --> 30:41.607
and you let him go
on his merry way

30:41.640 --> 30:46.045
while looking for someone else
to charge with murder.

30:46.078 --> 30:51.383
Dr. Halstead was cleared
because he didn't do it.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.085
Interesting.

30:53.119 --> 30:55.854
Did you ask him
where he was

30:55.888 --> 30:58.824
at the time
Nadia Decotis went missing?

30:58.857 --> 31:02.128
No, we did not.

31:02.161 --> 31:03.695
I guess you didn't
want to know.

31:03.729 --> 31:06.698
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

31:06.732 --> 31:08.467
No more questions.

31:14.406 --> 31:16.275
My brother was in Chicago
that day.

31:16.308 --> 31:18.144
We could find
a dozen witnesses.

31:18.177 --> 31:20.947
Then the trial becomes about
your brother and not Yates.

31:20.947 --> 31:22.814
- He's smart.
- He's scum.

31:22.848 --> 31:24.984
He knows what
he's doing.

31:25.017 --> 31:29.788
He gets off on torture,
even in court.

31:35.962 --> 31:38.564
I ran into Nadia
outside the police station.

31:38.597 --> 31:40.866
She warned me
about the Chicago PD.

31:40.967 --> 31:43.169
She said they were looking
for a patsy.

31:43.202 --> 31:45.271
And that's when you decided
to drive to New York

31:45.304 --> 31:47.173
with Ms. Decotis?

31:47.206 --> 31:48.707
No, I made that decision

31:48.740 --> 31:50.776
when she told me
what they were doing to her.

31:50.809 --> 31:51.877
Which was what?

31:51.978 --> 31:53.712
Her boss there,
Sergeant Voight,

31:53.745 --> 31:55.181
was making her
have sex with him.

31:55.214 --> 31:56.515
Objection, hearsay.

31:56.548 --> 31:59.251
It's key to my defense,
your Honor.

31:59.285 --> 32:02.088
I wasn't kidnapping her.
I was trying to help her escape.

32:02.121 --> 32:04.056
If it goes to your state
of mind, I'll allow it.

32:04.090 --> 32:07.559
Your testimony can only reflect
what you saw or experienced.

32:07.593 --> 32:10.196
Why did you get in the car
with Nadia Decotis, Dr. Yates?

32:10.229 --> 32:12.664
I believed Sergeant Voight
was raping her.

32:12.698 --> 32:16.002
She wanted to get away,
I helped her drive.

32:16.035 --> 32:19.905
She was distraught at the abuse
that she had suffered.

32:20.006 --> 32:23.375
She wanted to get high.
I tried to talk her out of it.

32:23.409 --> 32:25.377
- Did you succeed?
- Oh, I wish.

32:25.411 --> 32:27.446
But as soon
as we got to New York,

32:27.479 --> 32:30.049
she said that she was going
to get a fix.

32:30.082 --> 32:32.484
- Objection. Hearsay.
- Sustained.

32:32.518 --> 32:33.685
Jury will disregard.

32:33.719 --> 32:36.588
What was your last impression
of Nadia Decotis

32:36.622 --> 32:40.592
based on what you witnessed?

32:40.626 --> 32:42.828
She had a look in her eyes...

32:42.861 --> 32:45.697
a look that I recognized
from my medical practice.

32:45.731 --> 32:47.466
She was jonesing.

32:47.499 --> 32:52.038
I...I was afraid that
she would prostitute herself

32:52.071 --> 32:54.406
to get the money to buy heroin.

32:54.440 --> 32:57.209
After all,
that is the life she knew.

32:57.243 --> 33:00.112
She got out of the car.

33:00.146 --> 33:02.048
I never saw her again.

33:02.081 --> 33:04.150
Thank you, sir.

33:05.551 --> 33:11.190
So, Nadia Decotis told you
she decided to flee Chicago?

33:11.223 --> 33:13.492
- That's right.
- Did she happen to tell you

33:13.525 --> 33:16.295
why she decided
to go at that very moment,

33:16.328 --> 33:19.298
leaving behind $2,000
in a savings account,

33:19.331 --> 33:22.268
all her clothes
and other belongings,

33:22.301 --> 33:25.071
the new friends she'd made,
the Narcotics Anonymous group

33:25.071 --> 33:28.107
she'd been attending
faithfully?

33:28.140 --> 33:30.876
She was desperate to get out.

33:30.909 --> 33:33.079
- She didn't have her own car.
- That's not the question.

33:33.079 --> 33:34.713
She was supposed to go
to a birthday party but she--

33:34.746 --> 33:36.682
- Your Honor.
- Jury will disregard.

33:36.715 --> 33:37.983
Dr. Yates,
limit your testimony

33:38.084 --> 33:39.751
to answering only
the questions you are asked.

33:39.785 --> 33:44.090
Did Ms. Decotis know that CPD
considered you its main suspect

33:44.090 --> 33:46.258
in a series
of brutal rape/murders?

33:46.292 --> 33:47.859
Yes, but she also knew--

33:47.893 --> 33:50.629
She knew her entire squad
was looking for you,

33:50.662 --> 33:55.367
and yet she asked you,
of all people,

33:55.401 --> 33:59.171
to drive halfway
across the country with her?

33:59.205 --> 34:01.107
Actually, withdrawn.

34:02.374 --> 34:03.642
Nothing further.

34:05.877 --> 34:06.978
Redirect, your Honor.

34:07.012 --> 34:08.914
I'll allow.

34:08.947 --> 34:12.418
Dr. Yates, do you have
anything more to add?

34:12.451 --> 34:16.155
Yes. My impression of
Nadia Decotis' emotional state

34:16.188 --> 34:18.023
when I got in the car with her

34:18.124 --> 34:22.161
was that she was
under Sergeant Voight's command.

34:22.194 --> 34:24.430
She was traumatized
by him tying her up--

34:24.463 --> 34:26.132
Thank you, Doctor.
Nothing further.

34:26.165 --> 34:31.002
And brutally forcing himself
inside of her, again and again.

34:31.036 --> 34:32.604
Nothing further.

34:32.638 --> 34:34.906
Thank you, Doctor.

34:40.646 --> 34:43.215
Counselor, good job.

34:43.249 --> 34:45.284
- Did you see what we saw?
- The real Greg Yates?

34:45.317 --> 34:47.353
I just hope
the jury saw it.

34:54.160 --> 34:54.260
.

34:56.528 --> 34:57.396
Dr. Warner,
I just have a few more questions

34:58.397 --> 34:59.898
about Ms. Decotis' injuries.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.367
Your Honor, we've already
heard from this M.E.

35:01.400 --> 35:02.734
The state concluded
its case.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.570
The defendant alleged
the victim was a prostitute.

35:04.603 --> 35:05.571
I'm entitled to refute.

35:05.604 --> 35:07.239
Yes, you are.
Proceed.

35:07.273 --> 35:09.341
Um...

35:09.375 --> 35:13.845
Did you find evidence
in Ms. Decotis' body

35:13.879 --> 35:16.982
of multiple sexual partners?

35:17.015 --> 35:19.385
No, there was no DNA,

35:19.418 --> 35:21.787
and the condom lubricant
I found in her vagina and rectum

35:21.820 --> 35:23.189
was the same brand.

35:23.222 --> 35:25.657
So she was assaulted
in both places by the same man.

35:25.691 --> 35:27.426
It's likely.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.328
Judging
from the healing process,

35:29.361 --> 35:32.198
both penetrations occurred
around the same time.

35:32.231 --> 35:37.068
Did you make a full catalogue
of Ms. Decotis' injuries

35:37.102 --> 35:39.605
as shown
in these autopsy photos?

35:39.638 --> 35:42.107
Yes.
It was quite extensive.

35:48.079 --> 35:49.848
Thank you, Doctor.

35:51.950 --> 35:53.385
Cross-examine?

35:53.419 --> 35:55.854
- No.
- Yes.

35:55.887 --> 35:57.889
Which is it?

35:57.923 --> 36:00.259
Uh, yes, your Honor, I, uh...
[clears throat]

36:00.292 --> 36:02.027
I do have a few questions.

36:02.060 --> 36:04.296
May I examine
those photos?

36:04.330 --> 36:05.897
Absolutely.

36:24.883 --> 36:29.120
Dr. Yates,
your questions?

36:29.154 --> 36:31.557
Yes...yes.

36:31.590 --> 36:34.426
Uh, Doctor,

36:34.460 --> 36:37.463
could Ms. Decotis' injuries

36:37.496 --> 36:40.031
have been caused
by her prostitution?

36:40.065 --> 36:41.700
It's unlikely.

36:41.733 --> 36:43.369
She was savaged.

36:43.402 --> 36:46.505
Savaged, you say.
How so?

36:46.538 --> 36:50.642
In addition to the blunt
trauma and strangulation,

36:50.676 --> 36:54.145
there were cuts on her nipples
and external genitalia.

36:55.547 --> 36:58.717
And her anal sphincter,
was--was that torn?

36:58.750 --> 37:00.519
Yes, it was.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.588
And these injuries,
though not fatal,

37:02.621 --> 37:05.657
they would have been painful?

37:05.691 --> 37:07.459
Very.

37:07.493 --> 37:10.161
She died a slow death.

37:10.195 --> 37:14.800
How long did she survive
after the first attack started?

37:14.833 --> 37:17.803
30 minutes, maybe longer.

37:17.836 --> 37:21.006
And she would have been
in agony all through it?

37:21.039 --> 37:22.708
Mr. Barba,
not to put words in your mouth,

37:22.741 --> 37:25.744
but I'm willing to entertain
an objection if you have one.

37:25.777 --> 37:27.613
I'm fine, your Honor.

37:36.688 --> 37:41.327
Doctor, was she in
a lot of pain?

37:41.327 --> 37:44.630
Yes.
I'm sure she was.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.500
Were there signs of struggle?

37:50.035 --> 37:51.937
Yes.

37:51.970 --> 37:55.574
The skin was torn
around the ligature marks.

37:57.509 --> 38:02.414
What goes through a victim's
head in their final moments?

38:02.448 --> 38:03.949
Your Honor, may I please
speak with my client?

38:03.982 --> 38:07.018
- No, I'm not done here.
- A short recess.

38:07.052 --> 38:08.253
Sit down.

38:11.923 --> 38:15.727
Back to Nadia.
Would the terror,

38:15.761 --> 38:19.898
the fear, have flooded her
with adrenaline?

38:19.931 --> 38:22.368
I can't answer that.

38:22.401 --> 38:23.869
[small laugh, exhales]

38:23.902 --> 38:27.038
Would she have awareness

38:27.072 --> 38:28.574
of what was going on?

38:28.607 --> 38:30.409
Would she understand

38:30.442 --> 38:33.745
that these were
the final moments

38:33.779 --> 38:36.247
of her life?
[laughs]

38:37.683 --> 38:40.619
Come on, Doctor.
We are both medical people.

38:40.652 --> 38:43.121
Use your knowledge!

38:51.663 --> 38:53.999
Or...

38:54.032 --> 38:56.402
Or don't.

39:11.517 --> 39:13.985
Members of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

39:14.019 --> 39:16.555
We have, Your Honor.

39:16.588 --> 39:20.992
On the charge of rape and sodomy
in the first degree,

39:21.026 --> 39:23.962
we find the defendant,
Gregory Yates,

39:23.995 --> 39:26.465
guilty.
[courtroom murmurs]

39:26.498 --> 39:29.701
On the charge of murder
in the first degree,

39:29.735 --> 39:32.438
we find the defendant guilty.

39:32.438 --> 39:34.640
[courtroom murmuring]

39:36.074 --> 39:39.645
Dr. Yates, you will remain
in custody pending sentencing.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.248
Members of the jury,

39:43.281 --> 39:45.083
the State of New York
thanks you for your service.

39:45.116 --> 39:46.785
Court is adjourned.

39:46.818 --> 39:48.654
[taps gavel]

40:01.332 --> 40:04.936
Nadia was family.
We'll miss her.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.381
To Nadia.

40:16.414 --> 40:19.751
- To Nadia.
- To Nadia.

40:53.619 --> 40:56.454
Didn't see me coming,
did you?

40:56.488 --> 41:00.592
That's because you dropped
your guard for a second.

41:00.626 --> 41:04.896
I could end this right now,
just...

41:04.930 --> 41:07.599
snap your neck.

41:07.633 --> 41:10.001
Strangle you.

41:14.339 --> 41:19.645
You know better than anyone
how quickly this can end.

41:19.678 --> 41:22.013
You know what I figure?

41:26.785 --> 41:29.555
[coughing]

41:33.725 --> 41:37.663
What's the hurry?

41:37.696 --> 41:41.366
I want you to feel
what you made others feel.

41:41.399 --> 41:43.635
The pain.

41:43.669 --> 41:46.905
The fear.

41:46.938 --> 41:50.676
Looking over your shoulder
when you eat,

41:50.709 --> 41:53.444
take a leak,

41:53.478 --> 41:55.180
sleeping with both eyes open.

41:57.348 --> 42:01.286
Someone will do to you
what you did to Nadia.

42:06.725 --> 42:09.060
It's coming.
