00:09.360 --> 00:11.400
General, what's this all about?

00:11.480 --> 00:15.120
At 0920 hours this morning, someone
tried to enter the base using this.

00:15.200 --> 00:18.960
- Colonel O'Neill's security lD.
- After he was taken into custody,

00:19.040 --> 00:22.160
- he insisted on seeing you.
- Me? Why?

00:22.240 --> 00:26.560
I was hoping you could figure
that one out, Major. Open it.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.120
Thank you.
Now we're getting somewhere.

00:35.200 --> 00:38.240
Sergeant, that coffee
I asked for half an hour ago.

00:38.320 --> 00:41.320
Anytime you feel like getting it...

00:45.320 --> 00:46.960
He's a boy, sir.

00:47.960 --> 00:51.680
As it turns out, Carter, yes, I am.
For the moment.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.920
Do I know you?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.840
Come on.

00:56.920 --> 00:59.160
It's me.

00:59.240 --> 01:03.160
We tried to contact Colonel O'Neill,
even sent someone to his house.

01:03.240 --> 01:05.880
Do you understand
how much trouble you're in?

01:05.960 --> 01:11.000
lmpersonating a military officer
is a federal offence.

01:11.080 --> 01:14.640
I am not impersonating anyone.

01:16.640 --> 01:19.440
<i>I am Jack O'Neill.</i>

02:34.480 --> 02:35.920
Finally.

02:43.160 --> 02:46.480
Hot chocolate? Are you kidding?

02:48.560 --> 02:50.960
Where did you get this?

02:51.040 --> 02:55.320
I didn't... I didn't get it anywhere. It's mine.

02:55.400 --> 02:58.480
- Because you're Colonel O'Neill.
- Exactly.

03:01.960 --> 03:07.480
Last night I ate some dinner, had a beer,
went to bed, and woke up like this.

03:07.560 --> 03:11.080
Can we please get to the part
where you and Fraiser run some tests,

03:11.160 --> 03:14.280
find a cure, make me big again?

03:14.360 --> 03:18.720
- This is the security breach?
- Daniel, tell them who I am, please.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.720
OK, love to. Who are you?

03:21.680 --> 03:26.160
This young man
claims he's Colonel O'Neill.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.760
It's a joke, right?

03:29.960 --> 03:32.000
- What's going on?
- Daniel!

03:32.680 --> 03:36.640
Sounds like him -
at least the loud, grating parts.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.760
OK. You want proof?

03:38.840 --> 03:42.920
Carter, you once carried a Tok'ra named
Jolinar who gave her life to save you.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.800
Daniel, until recently
you were an ascended being.

03:45.880 --> 03:49.600
You broke the rules, you got
kicked out of the Oma Desala fan club,

03:49.680 --> 03:51.240
and had your memory erased.

03:51.320 --> 03:55.440
And you and Bra'tac both just
lost your snakes in a Goa'uld ambush.

03:55.520 --> 03:58.760
Had your tretonin yet this morning?

04:06.480 --> 04:10.240
How could this child
possess such knowledge?

04:13.360 --> 04:17.160
<i>Because it's me.</i>

04:25.640 --> 04:31.960
Anyone care to speculate how a boy
could be aware of classified information?

04:32.040 --> 04:35.360
- Well, sir, it could be him.
- There is a physical resemblance.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.880
But he can't be more than 15 years old.

04:37.960 --> 04:41.920
Are you saying Colonel O'Neill has
regressed more than 30 years overnight?

04:42.000 --> 04:44.960
- Stranger things have happened.
- Name but one.

04:45.040 --> 04:48.880
The time he got really old, the time
he became a caveman, the time we all...

04:48.960 --> 04:52.280
Why don't we move on to
the testing portion of this exercise?

04:54.040 --> 04:58.920
- Are you certain, Doctor?
- Within an acceptable margin of error,

04:59.000 --> 05:02.560
the boy's DNA is virtually identical
to Colonel O'Neill's.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.880
- What size margin of error?
- Very small.

05:05.960 --> 05:08.160
In a court of law,
the DNA sample we took

05:08.240 --> 05:12.880
would be considered a high-probability
match to that of Colonel O'Neill.

05:12.960 --> 05:17.480
There is a tiny abnormality,
but for all intents and purposes, it's him.

05:17.560 --> 05:21.920
"Tiny abnormality" - like the fact he's a
few years younger than he's meant to be?

05:22.000 --> 05:25.520
To be honest, this is out of my league.
We've got specialists flying in.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.800
We'll run more tests,
see what we can learn.

05:27.880 --> 05:31.320
In the meantime, we'll try
to make him as comfortable as possible.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.680
I'll go set up a PlayStation.

05:39.680 --> 05:44.360
You know... I think you two
are enjoying this just a little too much.

05:44.440 --> 05:46.680
Well, you are kinda cute.

05:47.960 --> 05:50.080
That's "sir" to you.

05:50.160 --> 05:56.200
And being trapped inside a scrawny
little body isn't my idea of cute, Carter.

05:56.600 --> 06:00.640
Does possessing a younger body
not have certain advantages, O'Neill?

06:00.720 --> 06:03.400
No. Not seeing it. What do you mean?

06:03.480 --> 06:07.120
Do you not experience
increased health and vitality?

06:08.720 --> 06:11.760
My vitality was just fine, thank you.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.680
I think what Teal'c is saying is valid.

06:16.760 --> 06:20.800
How many of us wouldn't trade everything
for the chance to live our lives over?

06:20.880 --> 06:24.320
Yeah, well, I don't plan
on staying like this.

06:24.400 --> 06:28.720
Well, in the meantime,
may I make a suggestion?

06:28.800 --> 06:32.280
Try enjoying this as much as we are.

06:33.080 --> 06:34.080
Sir.

06:59.440 --> 07:02.160
It's nice to know
some things don't change.

07:02.240 --> 07:04.760
I wasn't exactly expecting visitors.

07:04.840 --> 07:07.360
We'll send this stuff to the lab for analysis.

07:07.440 --> 07:12.200
Well, if they find MSG,
I will never order from them again.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.320
What are we doing here exactly?

07:14.400 --> 07:17.720
This is the last place
you remember being...

07:19.320 --> 07:21.520
Older?

07:21.600 --> 07:24.280
Are you conducting
a scientific experiment, O'Neill?

07:24.360 --> 07:27.160
Come on. That salsa's still good.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.240
What was the last thing you ate, sir?

07:38.520 --> 07:41.680
Four cheese burritos,
some guacamole on the side.

07:41.760 --> 07:45.480
- Anything else?
- A beer. Then I hit the sack.

07:46.160 --> 07:51.840
So whatever happened to you must
have occurred once you were asleep.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.560
Hey! Do you mind?

08:12.280 --> 08:14.280
Teal'c!

08:24.440 --> 08:25.760
Whoa.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.480
- O'Neill.
- What is it?

08:33.720 --> 08:37.919
Either I'm remembering
a particularly bad dream,

08:39.120 --> 08:42.480
or the Asgard paid me
a little visit last night.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.000
<i>(Hammond) What you're saying
makes no sense.</i>

08:53.080 --> 08:57.040
Jack's account sounds like a number
of UFO abduction case files I've read.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.720
This you remember.
My birthday you forget.

09:01.720 --> 09:03.800
Looks like you'll have a lot more.

09:03.880 --> 09:07.640
This encounter is incongruous
with all previous contact with the Asgard.

09:07.720 --> 09:12.280
Thor has indicated that the Asgard kept
an eye on human development on Earth.

09:12.360 --> 09:15.920
But we're allies now. We've
cooperated on a number of missions.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.120
- This I would not have agreed to.
- What could they possibly hope to gain

09:20.200 --> 09:24.600
from secretly making you younger
against your will?

09:26.680 --> 09:29.200
I got nothing.

09:29.280 --> 09:33.640
I'd like to cross-reference the abduction
accounts, see if I can find a connection.

09:33.720 --> 09:38.200
Please do. Major, I believe you have
a briefing to run at 1300 hours.

09:38.280 --> 09:41.200
- Yes, sir. I'll be there.
- The F-302 briefing?

09:41.280 --> 09:45.600
- I thought I was running that.
- It would be best if the major handled it.

09:45.680 --> 09:48.960
I'm sure you can impart
any information she needs to know.

09:49.040 --> 09:52.400
- But I'm the one who...
- Good. Dismissed.

10:01.520 --> 10:03.520
<i>- (knocking)
- Come in.</i>

10:05.880 --> 10:11.440
Jack, try to understand. Your situation
puts me in a very difficult position.

10:11.520 --> 10:15.160
No offence, but you're not the one
who went to bed watching CNN

10:15.240 --> 10:17.600
and woke up
as part of the MTV generation.

10:17.680 --> 10:20.360
Which is why Major Carter's
handling that briefing.

10:20.440 --> 10:22.680
I've flown the 302 more than anyone else.

10:22.760 --> 10:25.600
Be that as it may, the bottom line is,

10:25.680 --> 10:32.240
a room full of seasoned pilots aren't
going to respect the opinion of a boy.

10:32.320 --> 10:35.760
Sir, I just look like one for the moment.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.920
But those men in that room
need my expertise.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.560
And if they're gonna be working here,
they're gonna have to get used to...

10:43.640 --> 10:46.160
- unusual things happening.
- Look, Jack.

10:46.240 --> 10:50.680
No one is disputing that you may continue
to be a valuable asset to the SGC.

10:50.760 --> 10:56.440
But under the circumstances,
there's nothing I can do. I'm sorry.

10:57.440 --> 10:59.640
Yes, sir. I understand.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.200
Dumb idea.

11:07.760 --> 11:12.040
It would appear that many Tauri have
encountered beings from other worlds.

11:12.120 --> 11:16.160
Little do they know
how close they are to the truth.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.720
What exactly are we looking for,
Daniel Jackson?

11:18.800 --> 11:21.480
Any abduction accounts
that match Jack's story,

11:21.560 --> 11:26.040
and anyone claiming to have physically
regressed several decades overnight.

11:26.120 --> 11:30.600
- We need to enter our search parameters.
- It has already been done.

11:30.680 --> 11:33.080
Wow! That's a lot of people.

11:35.560 --> 11:37.840
Indeed.

11:37.920 --> 11:44.080
Let's see if any of these match Jack's
story. He said he saw four green lights.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.600
That's a little more reasonable.

11:48.680 --> 11:53.040
That's interesting. Of the narrowed-down
accounts, the most recent is from...

11:53.120 --> 11:57.080
- 19 years ago.
- Eight are here in the States.

11:57.160 --> 12:01.560
If these addresses are still valid,
we should talk to these people in person.

12:01.640 --> 12:07.040
- What do you hope to learn?
- I guess we'll know when we learn it.

12:09.600 --> 12:15.000
As your intel packages show, the F-302 is
a spaceworthy fighter-interceptor aircraft

12:15.080 --> 12:18.120
reverse-engineered
from Goa'uld technology.

12:18.200 --> 12:21.560
Your upcoming mission has been dubbed
"Operation Blue Phoenix".

12:21.640 --> 12:26.680
It'll be a live-fire combat simulation to
test the 302 against actual death gliders.

12:26.760 --> 12:29.200
- Captain?
- According to our mission reports,

12:29.280 --> 12:31.920
you were second seat
on the most recent 302 mission.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.680
Yes, and it included close combat. We'll
cover what was learned in that encounter.

12:36.760 --> 12:41.720
- Didn't Colonel O'Neill pilot that mission?
- Yes, as a matter of fact he did.

12:41.800 --> 12:47.720
He also commanded the X-302 on both
hyperspace window missions, didn't he?

12:47.800 --> 12:49.640
What's your point, Major?

12:49.720 --> 12:52.720
With respect, ma'am,
shouldn't he be running this briefing?

12:52.800 --> 12:56.920
Colonel O'Neill is unavailable.
However, I have several computer models

12:57.000 --> 13:00.640
to help you understand
how the 302 handles in combat situations.

13:00.720 --> 13:06.200
No offence, but those won't help me
when I'm pulling 6G's in a dogfight.

13:06.280 --> 13:11.280
As you should know, Captain,
the 302 has inertial dampening systems

13:11.360 --> 13:15.160
which I am more than qualified
to explain in detail, so let's just...

13:15.240 --> 13:19.480
<i>- (O'Neill) I just dropped by to say... Ow!
- Sir, please do not resist.</i>

13:19.560 --> 13:21.560
..stay focused.

13:21.640 --> 13:23.520
- OK, I'm warning you.
- Sir...

13:23.600 --> 13:26.640
Didn't I just say I was warning you?
Hey! Ooh!

13:26.720 --> 13:29.320
That's it! Now I'm mad.

13:30.760 --> 13:32.960
You can release him.

13:37.440 --> 13:41.800
I'll forgo the charges
for assaulting a superior officer.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.880
Carter.

13:45.760 --> 13:48.760
- Could have taken 'em.
- I'm sure.

13:48.840 --> 13:51.160
Sorry I'm late. What'd I miss?

13:51.240 --> 13:53.840
We were covering
the 302's flight capabilities.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.920
Then here's what you need to know.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.520
- Major, is this a joke?
- No, this is... Colonel O'Neill.

14:01.680 --> 14:06.760
I'm only gonna say this once,
so I'd suggest that you listen up.

14:06.840 --> 14:08.240
- Whatever you say.
- Hey!

14:08.320 --> 14:13.200
I realise that it doesn't actually say
"Colonel" on my uniform, but it should.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.440
Yes, sir.

14:22.040 --> 14:25.880
Now, velocity is key
during engagement with a glider.

14:25.960 --> 14:29.440
Your instincts tell you to floor it
because it's more manoeuvrable,

14:29.520 --> 14:32.760
but you've got to stay in control.

14:32.840 --> 14:38.960
The inertial dampeners only compensate
90% when pulling negative G's,

14:39.040 --> 14:44.800
so the real trick is knowing your enemy,
so you can anticipate their next moves.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.920
OK.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.600
Death gliders 101 .

14:56.240 --> 14:58.840
May I ask why the United States Air Force

14:58.920 --> 15:03.280
has taken a renewed interest
in my story after 26 years?

15:03.360 --> 15:06.600
All I can tell you is that
we have some new information.

15:06.680 --> 15:10.280
- Will it prove my story true?
- Eventually.

15:11.760 --> 15:14.480
- Maybe.
- Please tell us what happened to you.

15:15.360 --> 15:19.920
I was asleep in my bed, and a light
appeared in my room and took me.

15:20.320 --> 15:24.280
<i>- (Daniel) Took you where?
- Some kind of spacecraft, I suppose.</i>

15:24.360 --> 15:28.360
<i>I was weightless,
floating in midair, and yet...</i>

15:28.440 --> 15:33.840
It was dark, cold. I couldn't move
a muscle even though I was wide awake.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.880
- After the light hit you, then what?
- The devices came.

15:36.960 --> 15:40.760
<i>They were these green glowing balls
that floated around me.</i>

15:40.840 --> 15:43.240
<i>(man speaks Cantonese)</i>

15:43.320 --> 15:46.560
After the small green spheres
stopped scanning him...

15:46.640 --> 15:49.680
<i>- (Cantonese)
- ..they left him alone for a long while.</i>

15:49.760 --> 15:52.920
<i>(man speaks Cantonese)</i>

15:53.000 --> 15:56.480
And then a voice spoke to him,
telling him not to be afraid,

15:56.560 --> 16:02.040
- and that he would soon be safe again.
- Did Professor Wu see who spoke to him?

16:02.120 --> 16:05.320
<i>(interpreter speaks Cantonese)</i>

16:11.520 --> 16:15.400
All the accounts are basically identical.
They match Jack's version of events.

16:15.480 --> 16:19.000
Except none of them experienced
any physical changes as a result.

16:19.080 --> 16:23.240
But everything else is bang on - taken
while sleeping, out-of-body experience.

16:23.320 --> 16:27.000
All this does sound familiar -
cliché even, if you watch enough TV.

16:27.080 --> 16:33.120
But they all described four green globes
buzzing around them like insects.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.120
That's too specific a detail
to be a coincidence.

16:36.200 --> 16:40.040
The being that abducted them - I assume
they described an Asgard as well.

16:40.120 --> 16:42.280
Short, big eyes, no hair, weird voice.

16:42.360 --> 16:46.960
The Asgard haven't responded
to our attempted communications.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.480
If help is coming, it better arrive soon.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.560
<i>(electro-rock music)</i>

16:55.320 --> 16:57.720
<i>- (knocking)
- It's open.</i>

16:59.560 --> 17:01.400
How are you doing?

17:04.599 --> 17:08.920
Well, I think I'm getting
another zit, and, uh...

17:09.000 --> 17:11.960
Oh! Yeah, I'm still a kid.

17:12.040 --> 17:16.440
But beyond that,
I'm doing just peachy, thanks. Why?

17:18.359 --> 17:19.960
Well...

17:20.040 --> 17:26.839
Janet just finished going over the genetic
team's analysis of your test results.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.200
How bad can it be?

17:30.200 --> 17:33.280
You're probably not feeling the effects yet,

17:33.360 --> 17:37.520
but something is happening to your body
at the cellular level.

17:37.600 --> 17:43.200
Basically your genetic structure's
growing more unstable...

17:47.360 --> 17:49.360
Colonel...

17:51.000 --> 17:53.080
you're dying.

18:08.760 --> 18:10.880
Honestly, I feel fine.

18:10.960 --> 18:14.240
You'll start to notice symptoms
as the condition worsens.

18:14.320 --> 18:17.560
- How long do I have?
- It's hard to say.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.520
Say it anyway.

18:22.320 --> 18:24.800
Weeks, days, I don't know.

18:24.880 --> 18:29.480
You'll notice fatigue first. In the end,
your body's vital organs will shut down.

18:29.560 --> 18:35.200
It's like something inside you
is causing a total system failure.

18:36.200 --> 18:40.760
I don't get it. We helped save
their skinny asses from the replicators,

18:40.840 --> 18:43.640
and as a thanks they shrink me
and leave me to die.

18:43.720 --> 18:46.760
We're exploring
every option we have, Colonel.

18:46.840 --> 18:49.520
We just need you to hang in there.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.600
Thanks for coming.
I'm sure it'll help coming from you.

18:57.680 --> 19:03.800
- How are Mark and the kids?
- Good. Great. I'll tell them you said hi.

19:10.160 --> 19:14.040
I'm sorry. Sam told me
what was going on, but...

19:15.040 --> 19:17.640
What could anyone possibly
hope to gain from this?

19:17.720 --> 19:20.880
Can we just, uh... get on with it?

19:21.880 --> 19:23.880
I'm not getting any younger.

19:23.960 --> 19:27.760
Well, as I told Sam,
our options are pretty limited.

19:27.840 --> 19:29.840
You came all this way to say goodbye?

19:29.920 --> 19:33.120
At this point, I'm here
to recommend we put you in stasis

19:33.200 --> 19:36.720
- until we understand your condition.
- You wanna freeze me.

19:36.800 --> 19:40.080
We're not talking about cryogenics
as we know it here on Earth.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.760
The risk involved is minimal.

19:42.840 --> 19:46.040
I've been down this road
with the Tok'ra before.

19:46.120 --> 19:50.240
No offence, Jacob, but the last time
you guys helped me out of a "jam",

19:50.320 --> 19:54.280
I ended up rescuing an old girlfriend
I'd never met before.

19:54.360 --> 19:58.240
We would never subject you to another
blending without your permission.

19:58.320 --> 20:01.200
Good. Cos it's never gonna happen.

20:03.280 --> 20:07.000
No pressure, Jack.
But you need to make a decision.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.440
We have a team standing by.

20:09.520 --> 20:11.520
But if you wait too long,

20:11.600 --> 20:15.160
we may not be able to reverse
the cellular breakdown.

20:15.240 --> 20:16.960
Colonel, please.

20:22.280 --> 20:24.640
It's your choice, Jack.

20:26.560 --> 20:30.800
- Can I have five minutes to think about it?
- You can have ten, Colonel.

20:43.480 --> 20:47.600
- Do you think he'll do it?
- If I have to drag him there myself.

20:47.680 --> 20:51.640
I didn't come all this way
to watch him die like this.

20:56.560 --> 20:59.400
We have a security breach,
level 25, guest quarters.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.400
<i>(alarm)</i>

21:24.200 --> 21:29.160
Security teams have swept the base
three times, inside and out.

21:29.240 --> 21:32.920
They've found nothing. I think
it's safe to assume he's no longer here.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.320
He knows the SGC as well as anyone.
If he wanted a way out, he'd find one.

21:37.400 --> 21:41.000
I've notified the authorities.
With any luck they'll find him soon.

21:41.080 --> 21:44.160
Sir? There's something
you all need to see.

21:45.120 --> 21:49.760
Go on home, kid, before I call the cops.
It's a school night, for cryin' out loud.

21:49.840 --> 21:52.160
How about lite beer?

21:52.240 --> 21:54.240
Gimme a break.

22:05.840 --> 22:08.040
Harley?

22:09.440 --> 22:11.840
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, Harlan Beck.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.840
You served in Operation Proven Force
out of Incirlik.

22:15.920 --> 22:19.520
Yeah, during the Gulf.
How'd you know that, kid?

22:19.600 --> 22:22.360
What, are you kidding? I ran...

22:26.080 --> 22:30.880
I mean, uh... my uncle
knew a Lieutenant Beck from the war.

22:30.960 --> 22:36.200
Said he was a stand-up guy.
Flew an AC-130 gunship over Baghdad.

22:36.280 --> 22:39.320
Then your uncle
had to be in the Special Ops.

22:39.400 --> 22:42.640
Yeah, he was. Colonel Jack O'Neill?

22:44.160 --> 22:48.680
You're Jack O'Neill's nephew?
I didn't know he had a sibling.

22:50.240 --> 22:52.840
Well... used to.

22:54.120 --> 22:59.120
Uncle Jack's been like a father to me
since my folks died.

23:01.440 --> 23:04.680
So how's old Jack doin', anyway?

23:04.760 --> 23:08.240
He's fine. He's not that old, either.

23:09.680 --> 23:13.800
Well, tell him... tell him
Harley said to watch his six.

23:13.880 --> 23:17.480
Hey. Yeah, uh... speaking of six...

23:17.560 --> 23:21.320
Look, seeing as how
you know my uncle and all,

23:21.400 --> 23:24.520
you think you could do me a little favour?

23:31.880 --> 23:35.840
Selmak has had a chance to digest
some of the DNA test results,

23:35.920 --> 23:39.320
and it seems Colonel O'Neill's condition
isn't what we thought.

23:39.400 --> 23:43.120
- He isn't dying?
- He is, but we think we know the cause.

23:43.200 --> 23:48.240
When we first compared the DNA
samples, the match was almost perfect.

23:48.320 --> 23:54.360
- You said there was a tiny abnormality.
- Yes. Selmak thinks he knows why.

23:54.440 --> 23:57.120
<i>(distorted) This is not Colonel O'Neill.</i>

23:57.200 --> 23:59.400
- But...
- He's a clone.

24:09.040 --> 24:11.640
I see. Keep me informed.

24:15.360 --> 24:17.760
No word yet on...

24:19.280 --> 24:22.400
<i>What exactly do we call him at this point?</i>

24:23.400 --> 24:25.880
Duplicate O'Neill?

24:25.960 --> 24:29.200
Sir, we think we have a clearer idea
of what might be going on.

24:29.280 --> 24:32.160
- Enlighten me.
- We know the Asgard clone themselves.

24:32.240 --> 24:36.920
They clone their bodies, then transfer
their consciousness from one to the next.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.320
They suffer from grave diseases
due to thousands of years of cloning.

24:40.400 --> 24:43.200
Leading to extinction
if they can't solve the problem

24:43.280 --> 24:46.720
of diminishing returns
in their cloning technology.

24:46.800 --> 24:49.200
What does this have to do
with Colonel O'Neill?

24:49.280 --> 24:52.480
We had the abductees' DNA
that Teal'c and I interviewed

24:52.560 --> 24:55.920
scanned for the same abnormalities
as Duplicate O'Neill.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.680
As far as we can tell,
none of them are clones.

24:58.760 --> 25:01.640
- Which means?
- In all likelihood, the Asgard responsible

25:01.720 --> 25:05.320
took the original people
and replaced them with duplicates.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.960
They study the originals
and then switch them back.

25:08.040 --> 25:12.160
You think whoever took the real
Colonel O'Neill is going to return him?

25:12.240 --> 25:14.040
It's all we've got, sir.

25:14.120 --> 25:17.640
We're hoping the fact that the clone
didn't mature is a mistake.

25:17.720 --> 25:19.320
What makes you think that?

25:19.400 --> 25:23.280
The previous actions of this Asgard
indicated his desire to remain covert.

25:23.360 --> 25:25.360
Jack's clone is a dead giveaway.

25:25.440 --> 25:29.040
The Asgard doesn't know there's
a problem or he'd have tried to fix it.

25:29.120 --> 25:32.200
They'll figure it out
when they try to switch him back.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.720
If they try to switch.

25:33.800 --> 25:38.120
If we don't track down the duplicate,
we may not get the real O'Neill back?

25:38.200 --> 25:43.560
We're sure the Asgard could find him
if he wants. That's not the real issue.

25:43.640 --> 25:45.800
We wish to apprehend the Asgard.

25:45.880 --> 25:49.200
Intercepting the next switch
may be our only shot.

25:49.280 --> 25:50.640
<i>(buzzer)</i>

25:51.400 --> 25:53.600
<i>- Hammond.
- General Hammond, sir.</i>

25:53.680 --> 25:58.560
<i>I have a Lieutenant Colonel Beck from
the 10th Air Base Wing on the line for you.</i>

25:58.640 --> 26:01.520
<i>- It has to do with Colonel O'Neill.
- Patch him through.</i>

26:01.600 --> 26:03.480
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

26:16.240 --> 26:20.120
Unless you brought beer,
that's close enough.

26:21.800 --> 26:25.200
Colonel, we need you
to come back with us.

26:25.280 --> 26:26.840
How'd you find me?

26:26.920 --> 26:31.520
Lieutenant Colonel Beck called General
Hammond and placed you in the area.

26:31.600 --> 26:34.440
A man from whom you bought bait
recommended this river.

26:34.520 --> 26:38.200
Tell Jacob thanks, but I'm
not interested in the deep-freeze deal.

26:38.280 --> 26:41.520
We're not here to take you to the Tok'ra.
There may not be much time.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.640
- Never is, is there?
- OK. Well...

26:45.640 --> 26:48.600
There's no easy way to tell you this, so...

26:48.680 --> 26:52.600
Sam's just gonna
come right out and say it.

26:52.680 --> 26:56.720
Well, sir, as you know, the Asgard
depend on a cloning technology...

26:56.800 --> 26:58.600
Oh, for cryin' out loud!

27:00.080 --> 27:02.920
You have been cloned, O'Neill.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
What?

27:04.080 --> 27:09.360
We think the Asgard took the real you
and made a copy - an unstable one at that.

27:10.480 --> 27:12.720
The "real" me?

27:13.720 --> 27:19.440
Yeah, the original. That's not
your "real" anything. I'm sorry.

27:23.560 --> 27:26.160
Where's the original?

27:26.240 --> 27:30.280
That's what we hope to find out.
But we need your help.

27:37.720 --> 27:40.480
We've calculated a seven-day gap
between abductions,

27:40.560 --> 27:42.640
which puts us at tonight.

27:42.720 --> 27:45.360
This plan sucks.

27:47.960 --> 27:51.520
Look, I know you don't think
I am who I am,

27:51.600 --> 27:54.760
but as far as I'm concerned, I am...

27:56.320 --> 27:58.280
who I am.

27:59.200 --> 28:02.600
The switch is our only chance
of capturing whoever's behind this.

28:02.680 --> 28:05.520
What about the fact
that this body is dying?

28:05.600 --> 28:10.000
Has anyone even thought
about that for a second?

28:12.000 --> 28:14.760
Oh. I see.

28:15.760 --> 28:20.000
You don't care, as long as
you get the original back.

28:21.600 --> 28:24.520
We just... We don't know
what else to do for you.

28:24.600 --> 28:27.440
Perhaps the Asgard responsible
can correct his mistake.

28:27.520 --> 28:30.200
Fine. Give me a nine-mil.
I'll get it out of the sucker.

28:30.280 --> 28:32.680
We don't know who or what
we might be facing yet.

28:32.760 --> 28:38.000
Exactly why you can't just
use me as bait and hang me out to dry.

28:39.360 --> 28:41.560
You'll never intercept an Asgard beam.

28:41.640 --> 28:46.480
The only chance you have
of capturing this guy is me.

28:49.240 --> 28:51.600
Come on.

28:55.040 --> 28:57.080
A zat gun.

28:58.080 --> 29:00.000
Thank you, sir.

29:09.800 --> 29:12.240
Carter, you still got your ears on?

29:12.320 --> 29:15.240
- Yes, sir.
- Daniel? Teal'c?

29:16.120 --> 29:20.000
<i>- Everything appears to be normal, O'Neill.
- Yeah? Not to me.</i>

29:20.080 --> 29:21.960
Wanna go over the instructions again?

29:22.040 --> 29:26.000
Don't worry, Carter.
I'm sure I'll figure it out.

29:39.080 --> 29:41.240
Colonel, you all right?

29:41.320 --> 29:44.360
Jack! Jack!

29:44.920 --> 29:46.920
O'Neill.

29:56.600 --> 29:59.600
What are you all doing in my bedroom?

30:09.400 --> 30:12.400
Hello. Do not be afraid.

30:25.680 --> 30:27.200
<i>(groans)</i>

30:30.840 --> 30:34.680
- I assume this is important.
- Just a little, sir.

30:46.560 --> 30:48.000
OK.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.200
Wrong console.

30:54.560 --> 30:58.560
Far right jewel thingy... up.

31:01.560 --> 31:02.960
Ah! And three o'clock.

31:03.040 --> 31:05.720
I was having the weirdest dream.

31:10.160 --> 31:13.360
You see, Carter?
Told you it was no problem.

31:22.800 --> 31:25.200
What's goin' on?

31:26.520 --> 31:31.520
Wow. You know, I'm really
much taller than I think.

31:35.080 --> 31:36.120
Carter?

31:36.960 --> 31:40.840
Colonel O'Neill, meet... Colonel O'Neill.

31:45.440 --> 31:49.840
- What's goin' on?
- We're pretty sure this Asgard over here

31:49.920 --> 31:53.800
kidnapped you and attempted
to replace you with a clone.

31:53.880 --> 31:56.080
How long was I asleep?

31:56.160 --> 31:59.480
- Seven days.
- It's a record.

31:59.560 --> 32:01.080
So you're...

32:01.160 --> 32:02.200
- You.
- ..me?

32:02.280 --> 32:08.560
Yeah. Believe me, if you think it's weird,
imagine how I feel being the copy.

32:11.920 --> 32:14.320
He has awakened.

32:21.720 --> 32:25.240
- What's happening?
- We were kinda hoping you could tell us.

32:25.320 --> 32:28.880
- No, no, no. This is all wrong.
- Hey!

32:30.400 --> 32:32.520
I'll tell you what's wrong.

32:32.600 --> 32:37.080
I just woke up, I haven't had coffee,
let alone a pee in seven days,

32:37.160 --> 32:42.320
and I find out you stole my ass
and made a... mini-me.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.560
Carter, I should be irked currently, yes?

32:51.360 --> 32:53.560
Yes, I would be.

32:56.440 --> 33:00.160
- Why don't you tell us who you are?
- Loki.

33:00.920 --> 33:04.680
According to Norse mythology,
that's the god of mischief.

33:04.760 --> 33:08.920
- What did you want with Colonel O'Neill?
- I have nothing more to say to any of you.

33:09.000 --> 33:13.120
Hey! We just saved your flat little
white asses from the replicators.

33:13.200 --> 33:16.800
- This is the thanks we get?
- At least you're gonna live.

33:17.800 --> 33:19.360
What?

33:19.440 --> 33:25.680
Maybe you're a little put out. But this guy
didn't hit the right buttons on the Xerox.

33:26.520 --> 33:30.840
This body is gonna fall apart
if he doesn't fix me.

33:30.920 --> 33:34.920
I cannot. All the clones
suffer the same fate.

33:35.960 --> 33:39.120
OK. I'm going back
to my original question.

33:39.200 --> 33:41.680
What's going on?

33:41.760 --> 33:46.280
I am a scientist, a former geneticist
with the Asgard Ruling Council.

33:46.360 --> 33:48.520
- Former?
- I was stripped of my stature

33:48.600 --> 33:52.360
after I was caught performing
unsanctioned experiments on humans.

33:52.440 --> 33:54.960
What, you've got sanctioned ones?

33:55.040 --> 33:59.840
I had the courage to do what was needed
to advance our cloning technology.

33:59.920 --> 34:03.640
Instead of courage,
some might call it a lack of morality.

34:03.720 --> 34:07.440
Our population cannot withstand
the duplication process for much longer.

34:07.520 --> 34:10.080
How can experimenting on humans
change that?

34:10.159 --> 34:14.800
Your bodies are similar to
our original form thousands of years ago.

34:14.880 --> 34:17.320
Using your physical make-up
as a template,

34:17.400 --> 34:23.480
I hoped to construct a clone that could
contain our massively superior intellect.

34:23.560 --> 34:27.880
- My research was unsuccessful.
- So much for massively superior intellect.

34:27.960 --> 34:31.000
<i>- I was gonna say that.
- I was going to say</i>

34:31.080 --> 34:34.679
it was unsuccessful prior to
my being caught and banished.

34:34.760 --> 34:41.080
- I would have found what I needed.
- Why risk coming back after 19 years?

34:41.159 --> 34:44.679
Because I thought he was the one.

34:45.560 --> 34:47.800
- Me?
- Me?

34:47.880 --> 34:51.199
I believed his genetic code
contained the key.

34:51.280 --> 34:52.320
- Mine?
- Mine?

34:52.400 --> 34:53.880
Stop it.

34:53.960 --> 34:57.920
He was physiologically advanced enough
to carry and utilise all the data

34:58.000 --> 35:00.680
from the Ancients'
repository of knowledge -

35:00.760 --> 35:03.800
impossible for any human
one generation ago.

35:03.880 --> 35:07.040
He is a significant step forward
on your evolutionary path.

35:07.120 --> 35:12.120
- You just found this out recently?
- I learned it when all the Asgard did.

35:12.200 --> 35:14.200
O'Neill is legendary.

35:14.280 --> 35:18.280
The Asgard fleet has been distracted
by the war with the replicators

35:18.360 --> 35:21.080
and subsequent relocation of our people.

35:21.960 --> 35:25.480
So you took the opportunity when
no one was looking to sneak back here.

35:25.560 --> 35:30.160
I do not regret my actions.
I am trying to save my people.

35:30.840 --> 35:33.920
Look, I know this isn't all about me,
but come on.

35:34.000 --> 35:38.480
- Seriously, I'm dyin' here.
- I cannot reverse your fate.

35:38.560 --> 35:43.400
Nor can I explain why you did not mature
to the proper age as you should have.

35:43.480 --> 35:47.040
Well, easy to see why
they kicked you out of the science club.

35:47.120 --> 35:50.000
All right, I've heard enough.

35:51.760 --> 35:53.280
Carter!

35:55.080 --> 35:57.840
Can you call Thor on this thing?

35:58.600 --> 36:03.320
- Please, do not.
- We've tried contacting the Asgard.

36:03.760 --> 36:07.680
- You'd think if Thor knew about this...
- OK, pretty sure that's it.

36:19.840 --> 36:23.320
All right, how long are we going...

36:23.400 --> 36:25.960
You all right?

36:27.960 --> 36:29.960
Actually, no.

36:30.040 --> 36:33.280
What do we do if Thor doesn't show up?

36:35.840 --> 36:37.200
Never mind.

36:37.280 --> 36:40.040
Well, it's about time.

36:40.120 --> 36:43.000
I apologise for not coming sooner.

36:44.240 --> 36:46.160
Loki, what have you done?

36:46.240 --> 36:50.200
Seems he's been playing Dr Moreau
behind your back.

36:50.280 --> 36:52.280
Yes. Dr Moreau.

36:52.360 --> 36:54.880
- You know why I am here.
- You should have known

36:54.960 --> 36:58.440
O'Neill's genetic coding
was safeguarded for his own protection.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.280
Excuse me?

37:00.360 --> 37:06.520
A marker was placed in your DNA to
prevent attempts at genetic manipulation.

37:06.600 --> 37:10.120
- The abnormality.
- That's why the clone didn't mature.

37:10.200 --> 37:13.840
Yes. Loki will be punished for his actions.

37:13.920 --> 37:18.040
Is it true that Colonel O'Neill is the key
to solving your cloning problems?

37:18.120 --> 37:19.800
No.

37:19.880 --> 37:23.320
- But I thought I was advanced.
- Indeed you are, O'Neill.

37:23.400 --> 37:26.120
But our scientists
have already determined

37:26.200 --> 37:29.680
that while you are an important step
forward in the evolutionary chain,

37:29.760 --> 37:33.840
the missing link we have been
searching for still eludes us.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.000
I'm sorry.

37:35.080 --> 37:39.520
Again, I apologise for any inconvenience
Loki may have caused.

37:39.600 --> 37:41.920
Yeah, that's what I'd call it.

37:42.000 --> 37:47.480
Unfortunately, the eventual genetic
breakdown of the clone is not my doing,

37:47.560 --> 37:50.280
but rather a result of Loki's inept methods.

37:50.360 --> 37:54.880
There was no need
for the clones to survive.

38:01.920 --> 38:03.920
Look, Thor.

38:04.000 --> 38:09.080
Is there anything you can do for him?
The whining's starting to grate.

38:09.160 --> 38:12.920
- You wish your clone to live?
- You can't just let me die.

38:17.760 --> 38:21.440
- He's just a kid.
- Are you certain, O'Neill?

38:25.320 --> 38:27.320
I'm thinking.

38:30.280 --> 38:32.240
- Yeah.
- Very well.

38:32.680 --> 38:35.800
I will attempt to repair his DNA.

38:35.880 --> 38:41.480
If successful, he should continue
to mature at a normal human rate.

38:49.560 --> 38:51.560
Thanks.

39:22.120 --> 39:24.200
You sure about this?

39:25.200 --> 39:28.200
I've thought a lot about it.

39:28.280 --> 39:34.960
You know, you... me. I mean,
we never really did embrace high school.

39:38.560 --> 39:42.280
Haven't you ever wanted to go back
and do it all over again,

39:42.360 --> 39:45.160
especially with all you know now?

39:48.120 --> 39:50.120
No.

39:51.040 --> 39:54.960
Well, from here on in
you and me are different.

39:55.040 --> 39:57.520
Which is why I'm gonna do this.

40:01.760 --> 40:04.640
Hey, listen. Do me a favour, huh?

40:05.320 --> 40:08.360
Don't worry, I wasn't gonna keep in touch.

40:08.440 --> 40:11.440
- Yeah, it'd just be a little...
- Weird.

40:11.520 --> 40:13.520
Weird, yeah.

40:13.600 --> 40:14.800
Yeah.

40:15.680 --> 40:18.040
But if you need anything, just...

40:18.120 --> 40:21.840
The air force has set me up. I'll be fine.

40:22.240 --> 40:25.800
You sure about this?
I mean, it's high school.

40:32.200 --> 40:35.880
Yes. Go forth, young man.
