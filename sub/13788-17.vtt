WEBVTT

00:06.177 --> 00:08.259
MOM, DAD,
WE HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

00:08.259 --> 00:10.261
YOU FINALLY FOUND
THE TV REMOTE.

00:10.261 --> 00:14.095
- NOPE.
- I GUESS WE HAVE
TO KEEP READING.

00:14.095 --> 00:17.268
WE'VE DECIDED ON
OUR PRESENT FOR
YOUR ANNIVERSARY.

00:17.268 --> 00:19.350
WE'RE GONNA THROW YOU
A SECOND WEDDING.

00:19.350 --> 00:22.233
OH, MY GOSH, THAT IS
SUCH A WONDERFUL
ANNIVERSARY PRESENT,

00:22.233 --> 00:24.735
- ISN'T IT, BENNETT?
- UH.

00:25.906 --> 00:28.069
WE FIGURED IT WAS
THE LEAST WE COULD DO

00:28.069 --> 00:30.241
SINCE WE RUINED
THE FIRST WEDDING.

00:30.241 --> 00:31.822
AND I JUST WENT ALONG
BECAUSE AVERY SAID

00:31.822 --> 00:33.204
COME ON, WE'RE DOING
SOMETHING IN THE KITCHEN,

00:33.204 --> 00:35.326
AND I STUPIDLY ASSUMED
IT WAS EATING.

00:35.326 --> 00:39.540
HONEY, WE'RE GONNA GET TO
SAY THE VOWS WE NEVER
GOT TO SAY THE FIRST TIME.

00:39.540 --> 00:43.334
THAT'S GREAT, BECAUSE MY VOWS
WOULD'VE REALLY BLOWN YOU AWAY.

00:43.334 --> 00:45.256
MY VOWS WOULD'VE BLOWN YOU
INTO ANOTHER DIMENSION

00:45.256 --> 00:47.258
WHERE PLUSH TOYS
RULE THE WORLD,

00:47.258 --> 00:49.380
WHICH DOESN'T MAKE
A LOT OF SENSE,

00:49.380 --> 00:53.384
BUT IT'S A DREAM I'VE
BEEN HAVING LATELY,
AND IT SCARES ME.

00:53.384 --> 00:56.097
GUYS, VOWS AREN'T
SUPPOSED TO BE
A COMPETITION,

00:56.097 --> 00:57.938
AND, FOR THE RECORD,
I THINK WE'RE ALL

00:57.938 --> 01:00.481
A LITTLE SCARED BY
THE PLUSH TOY DREAM.

01:00.481 --> 01:03.814
OF COURSE IT'S NOT
A COMPETITION.

01:03.814 --> 01:06.817
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
SO HAPPY YOU MARRIED ME.

01:06.817 --> 01:10.281
I AM GONNA REMARRY
THAT SMUG LOOK RIGHT
OFF YOUR FACE.

01:11.782 --> 01:15.696
AW, I KNEW THIS WOULD BE
THE PERFECT ANNIVERSARY GIFT.

01:15.696 --> 01:17.288
I LOVE WEDDINGS.

01:17.288 --> 01:19.410
I HAD AN OWNER ONCE
WHO WAS A FLORIST,

01:19.410 --> 01:20.751
AND I'D GO WITH HIM
TO A LOT OF WEDDINGS,

01:20.751 --> 01:22.413
WHICH IS WHERE I HONED
MY SKILLS

01:22.413 --> 01:25.376
AS AN UNDER-THE-TABLE
TOASTMASTER.

01:25.376 --> 01:28.129
TO NINA AND ISAAC.

01:28.129 --> 01:31.342
LET ME PASS ON SOME TIPS
FOR A HAPPY MARRIAGE.

01:31.342 --> 01:33.634
EVERY DAY,
YOU SHOULD KISS EACH OTHER,

01:33.634 --> 01:35.216
SAY "I LOVE YOU,"

01:35.216 --> 01:38.429
AND SCRAPE YOUR LEFTOVERS
UNDER THE TABLE...

01:38.429 --> 01:40.431
STARTING NOW.

01:40.431 --> 01:42.223
I'M SERIOUS.

01:42.223 --> 01:44.395
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

01:44.395 --> 01:46.227
Woman: WHO IS SAYING THAT?

01:46.227 --> 01:48.189
Man: I DON'T KNOW,
BUT HE SOUNDS SERIOUS.

01:48.189 --> 01:49.650
WE'D BETTER DO IT.

01:50.941 --> 01:52.943
( laughs )
YEAH!

01:52.943 --> 01:55.736
THIS MARRIAGE
IS GONNA WORK.

02:12.513 --> 02:15.426
ALL RIGHT.
I THINK THAT WE HAVE
EVERYTHING WE NEED HERE

02:15.426 --> 02:18.018
FOR THE WEDDING,
AND SINCE WE'RE ON A BUDGET,

02:18.018 --> 02:19.640
I FOUND A PLACE THAT
RESELLS SUPPLIES

02:19.640 --> 02:21.432
FROM CANCELLED WEDDINGS.

02:21.432 --> 02:24.855
THEIR MOTTO IS,
"NOBODY OBJECTS...

02:24.855 --> 02:26.477
TO OUR PRICES."

02:26.477 --> 02:28.399
OKAY, IT ISN'T,
BUT IT SHOULD BE.

02:28.399 --> 02:30.401
I TOLD THEM
,AND THEY'RE CONSIDERING IT.

02:32.533 --> 02:35.576
OKAY, WE'VE GOT
TABLE SETTINGS,
NAPKINS, AND PLACE CARDS.

02:35.576 --> 02:38.409
OH, HEY, CAN WE INVITE
VICKY AND STEVEN WEINTRAUB?

02:38.409 --> 02:39.830
- WHO ARE THEY?
- I DON'T KNOW,

02:39.830 --> 02:41.702
BUT DO YOU WANNA USE
THESE PLACE CARDS OR NOT?

02:41.702 --> 02:44.205
AND THE BEST PART,

02:44.205 --> 02:47.628
THE BOX ON THE PATIO
HAS OLD DISCOUNT DOVES

02:47.628 --> 02:50.341
GUARANTEED TO BE
TOO WEARY TO FLY AWAY.

02:50.341 --> 02:54.255
THEIR MOTTO IS,
"OLD DOVES FOR NEW LOVES."

02:56.847 --> 03:00.391
OKAY, IT ISN'T, BUT THEY'RE
CONSIDERING THAT ONE, TOO.

03:00.391 --> 03:03.894
YOU STILL HAVEN'T
TOLD ME HOW THAT FIRST
WEDDING GOT RUINED.

03:03.894 --> 03:05.976
I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT,
IT'LL TAKE MY MIND OFF

03:05.976 --> 03:08.809
THE DISCOUNT DOVES I'M
TRYING VERY HARD NOT TO EAT.

03:08.809 --> 03:11.812
I'M WALKING BACKWARDS TOWARD
THE PATIO RIGHT NOW, AREN'T I?

03:11.812 --> 03:15.236
- STAN!
- SORRY.

03:15.236 --> 03:18.279
ANYWAY, IF YOU WANNA UNDERSTAND
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE WEDDING,

03:18.279 --> 03:21.282
WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO
THE FIRST TIME WE ALL MET.

03:21.282 --> 03:23.374
THIS PLACE USED TO BE
WAY COOLER.

03:23.374 --> 03:26.166
DAD, NOT SO MUCH.

03:26.166 --> 03:28.088
KIDS, COME ON.

03:28.088 --> 03:29.920
MY GIRLFRIEND ELLEN
AND HER DAUGHTER

03:29.920 --> 03:31.332
ARE GONNA BE HERE SOON
TO MEET YOU.

03:31.332 --> 03:35.135
CAN YOUR GIRLFRIEND TURN
INVISIBLE LIKE ME?

03:35.135 --> 03:36.927
WATCH.

03:36.927 --> 03:39.930
CHLOE? WHERE'S CHLOE?

03:39.930 --> 03:41.342
I'M RIGHT HERE, DADDY.

03:41.342 --> 03:44.475
DIDN'T MEAN
TO SCARE YOU.

03:44.475 --> 03:47.438
SO, SWEETIE, HOW DO I LOOK?
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS TIE?

03:47.438 --> 03:49.400
IT'S LIKE THE STRING
FOR YOUR BALLOON HEAD.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.111
OKAY.

03:51.111 --> 03:53.314
THIS IS SO WEAK.

03:53.314 --> 03:56.737
WHY DO WE HAVE TO DRESS UP
TO MEET YOUR LAME-O GIRLFRIEND?

03:56.737 --> 03:58.529
SHE IS NOT A LAME-O.

03:58.529 --> 04:00.411
YOU NEED TO LOOK GOOD
BECAUSE YOU ONLY GET

04:00.411 --> 04:02.072
ONE CHANCE TO MAKE
A FIRST IMPRESSION.

04:02.072 --> 04:06.206
OH... GLAD I CAUGHT THAT.

04:06.206 --> 04:08.038
NOW TUCK YOUR SHIRT IN.

04:08.038 --> 04:10.751
WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS
TRYING TO CHANGE ME?

04:10.751 --> 04:12.082
BECAUSE I'M YOUR FATHER,

04:12.082 --> 04:14.084
AND THERE IS STUFF
WRONG WITH YOU.

04:14.084 --> 04:16.176
SORRY I SAID THAT.
I'M JUST NERVOUS.

04:16.176 --> 04:18.178
AND THERE IS
STUFF WRONG WITH YOU.

04:18.178 --> 04:21.432
WE'LL COMPROMISE.
HALF TUCK BEHIND
THE BUCKLE.

04:21.432 --> 04:24.475
- GREAT.
- ACTUALLY, THAT IS GREAT.

04:24.475 --> 04:28.849
I THINK I'LL CALL IT
THE TUCKLE.

04:28.849 --> 04:30.981
Stan: SO THAT'S WHERE
THAT CAME FROM.

04:30.981 --> 04:32.983
IT'S LIKE HEARING THE STORY

04:32.983 --> 04:34.985
OF HOW THOSE GUYS BUILT
THAT FIRST PERSONAL COMPUTER

04:34.985 --> 04:37.027
IN THEIR GARAGE,

04:37.027 --> 04:39.360
AND THEN, TUCKED IT
INTO THEIR UNDERWEAR.

04:39.360 --> 04:41.992
OKAY, THIS IS THE PLACE.
I'M SO NERVOUS.

04:41.992 --> 04:43.784
WHY AM I SO NERVOUS?

04:43.784 --> 04:45.456
WELL, LET'S SEE.
YOU'RE A PIT SWEATER,

04:45.456 --> 04:46.867
YOU LAUGH LIKE
A DONKEY,

04:46.867 --> 04:48.999
AND THAT WIG MAKES YOU
LOOK LIKE A MANNEQUIN.

04:48.999 --> 04:52.212
YOU'RE NOT MAKING ME
ANY LESS NERVOUS, AVERY.

04:52.212 --> 04:54.254
NO, BUT I DID MAKE YOU
LOOK LESS LIKE A MANNEQUIN.

05:01.091 --> 05:05.516
ELLEN, YOU ARE
AS BEAUTIFUL AS
A SHAKESPEAREAN SONNET.

05:05.516 --> 05:08.429
ACTUALLY, SHAKESPEARE
DIDN'T WRITE ANYTHING
ATTRIBUTED TO HIM.

05:08.429 --> 05:10.641
THE 17th EARL OF OXFORD
IS THE MOST LIKELY--

05:10.641 --> 05:12.232
BENNETT, I'D LIKE YOU
TO MEET

05:12.232 --> 05:14.234
MY PERFECTLY NORMAL
DAUGHTER, AVERY.

05:15.275 --> 05:18.108
I'M NOT PERFECTLY NORMAL.

05:18.108 --> 05:21.241
THOUGH I'M ALSO NOT
A 60-YEAR-OLD AGING
BACKWARDS AS SOMEONE SUGGESTED.

05:21.241 --> 05:24.114
VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.
COME ON IN.

05:24.114 --> 05:26.907
- OH.
- MMM.

05:26.907 --> 05:29.289
I WOULD LOVE FOR
THE TWO OF YOU

05:29.289 --> 05:30.451
TO MEET MY FAMILY.

05:30.451 --> 05:33.624
TYLER, CHLOE,
THIS IS ELLEN AND AVERY.

05:34.875 --> 05:36.877
Both: YOU!

05:36.877 --> 05:39.299
Stan: WAIT. YOU TWO ALREADY
KNEW EACH OTHER?

05:39.299 --> 05:41.722
WHAT-WHAT?

05:41.722 --> 05:44.515
AMAZING!
MIND BLOWN.

05:44.515 --> 05:46.346
CONTINUE.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.429
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
GOT ME DETENTION.

05:48.429 --> 05:51.311
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO DID
A STUPID BIKE JUMP
IN THE MIDDLE OF SCHOOL

05:51.311 --> 05:52.433
AND RAN OVER
MY BACKPACK.

05:52.433 --> 05:54.184
YOU CAN GET
ANOTHER BACKPACK.

05:54.184 --> 05:57.107
I WAS WEARING IT.

05:57.107 --> 05:59.319
HEY, LOOK.

05:59.319 --> 06:00.981
SO YOU DON'T GET ALONG.

06:00.981 --> 06:03.113
WE CAN ALL CHANGE.
LOOK AT ME, I CHANGED MY HAIR.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.195
OH, YOUR HAIR.

06:05.195 --> 06:06.487
THAT'S WHAT'S DIFFERENT
ABOUT YOU.

06:06.487 --> 06:07.788
YOU DIDN'T NOTICE?

06:07.788 --> 06:09.580
OF COURSE I DID.

06:09.580 --> 06:11.371
I DIDN'T KNOW IF
YOU NOTICED.

06:12.413 --> 06:13.994
HELLO. I'M AVERY.

06:13.994 --> 06:16.206
I'M CHLOE.
WANNA PLAY DOLLS?

06:16.206 --> 06:18.799
CAN MY DOLL BE AN EXECUTIVE
AT A BIG COMPANY

06:18.799 --> 06:21.211
WHO'S CONTEMPLATING A MOVE
TO A SMALLER START-UP

06:21.211 --> 06:23.303
WHERE SHE CAN HAVE
MORE CONTROL?

06:23.303 --> 06:27.007
- SURE.
- OKAY.

06:27.007 --> 06:29.139
LOOK AT THAT.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.562
CHLOE AND AVERY
ARE GETTING ALONG.

06:31.562 --> 06:34.064
LET'S FOCUS ON
THAT AND NOT THE
TYLER-AVERY THING,

06:34.064 --> 06:36.437
AND MAKE THE BIG
LIFE-CHANGING ANNOUNCEMENT.

06:36.437 --> 06:38.358
- LIFE-CHANGING?
- BIG?

06:38.358 --> 06:40.360
WHAT DID YOUR HAIR
USED TO LOOK LIKE?

06:40.360 --> 06:44.404
KIDS, AFTER A WHIRLWIND
THREE-MONTH ROMANCE,

06:44.404 --> 06:46.326
WE ARE GETTING MARRIED.

06:46.326 --> 06:47.367
- NO!
- WHAT?

06:47.367 --> 06:49.990
WE ARE GONNA MOVE IN
AND ALL BE A FAMILY
TOGETHER.

06:49.990 --> 06:53.243
- MY LIFE'S OVER.
- I'M DEAD.
I DIED.

06:53.243 --> 06:55.205
WOW, I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT

06:55.205 --> 06:57.538
HOW THE ANIMOSITY
BETWEEN YOU GUYS
RUINED THE WEDDING.

06:57.538 --> 06:59.630
I ASSUME THE TIE
ARE TIED TOGETHER,

06:59.630 --> 07:04.254
BUT HOW? HOW?!
I'M ON PINS AND NEEDLES.

07:08.218 --> 07:10.050
WORKING ON
YOUR VOWS, MOMMY?

07:10.050 --> 07:11.431
I'M HAVING A BREAKTHROUGH.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.393
"BENNETT, YOU ARE MY...

07:13.393 --> 07:15.225
HUSBAND."

07:15.225 --> 07:16.517
THAT IS A FACT.
GOOD START.

07:16.517 --> 07:18.859
NOT, IT'S NOT.

07:18.859 --> 07:20.230
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST
USE THE VOWS

07:20.230 --> 07:22.693
YOU DIDN'T GET TO SAY
AT YOUR DISASTER WEDDING.

07:22.693 --> 07:24.234
YOUR DADDY
DOESN'T KNOW THIS,

07:24.234 --> 07:26.066
BUT THE DISASTER
ACTUALLY SAVED ME.

07:26.066 --> 07:28.278
I COULDN'T COME UP
WITH ANY VOWS.

07:28.278 --> 07:31.492
MY BACK-UP PLAN
WAS TO SCREAM "ZOMBIES,"
AND RUN OUT OF THE ROOM.

07:31.492 --> 07:33.624
ASK DADDY FOR HELP.
HE'S A WRITER.

07:33.624 --> 07:35.415
NO, I CAN'T.

07:35.415 --> 07:36.787
I TOLD HIM MY VOWS
WERE GONNA BLOW HIM AWAY.

07:36.787 --> 07:39.419
THEN I GAVE HIM
AN AQUARIUM FULL OF FISH

07:39.419 --> 07:41.341
THAT SAID, "YOU'RE
GONNA GET SCHOOLED."

07:41.341 --> 07:43.133
NOW I HAVE NO VOWS,

07:43.133 --> 07:45.676
AND A SALTWATER AQUARIUM
TO MAINTAIN.

07:45.676 --> 07:49.389
SO I'M GONNA GO LOOK
AT THE FISH NOW.

07:49.389 --> 07:51.892
MY VOWS DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO BE GREAT.

07:51.892 --> 07:54.434
THEY JUST HAVE TO BE
BETTER THAN YOUR DAD'S.

07:54.434 --> 07:56.306
IF ONLY I KNEW
WHAT HE WAS WRITING.

07:56.306 --> 07:57.518
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
SPY ON HIM?

07:57.518 --> 07:59.439
OH, CHLOE, I COULD
NEVER DO THAT.

07:59.439 --> 08:02.022
BUT SINCE YOU
BROUGHT IT UP...

08:02.022 --> 08:04.314
HE'LL NEVER KNOW
I'M THERE.

08:09.199 --> 08:11.782
HEY, SWEETS,
HON, PLEASE, NOT NOW.

08:11.782 --> 08:15.325
DADDY'S TRYING TO WRITE
HIS VOWS, OKAY?

08:15.325 --> 08:17.167
OKAY, WHY ARE
YOUR HANDS WET?

08:17.167 --> 08:19.079
I WAS PETTING FISH.

08:19.079 --> 08:20.791
CATFISH DON'T PURR...

08:20.791 --> 08:23.293
OR HAVE NINE LIVES.

08:24.384 --> 08:26.336
SO HOW GOOD
ARE YOUR VOWS?

08:26.336 --> 08:28.258
ARE THEY GONNA BE
BETTER THAN MOMMY'S?
NOT THAT I'M SPYING.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.430
CHLOE, DID MOMMY
SEND YOU TO SPY?

08:30.430 --> 08:32.512
SPIES NEVER TELL
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.935
I JUST TOLD YOU,
DIDN'T I?

08:37.898 --> 08:39.189
( cell phone chiming )

08:39.189 --> 08:41.191
OH, AVERY JUST TEXTED.

08:41.191 --> 08:43.403
SHE'S HAVING TROUBLE FINDING
A DECENT USED CAKE.

08:43.403 --> 08:46.356
THE ONLY ONE SO FAR
IS ORANGE, AND CONE SHAPED.

08:46.356 --> 08:48.318
OH, THE COUPLE WHO
CANCELLED THEIR WEDDING

08:48.318 --> 08:50.240
MET ON A ROAD CREW.

08:50.240 --> 08:53.363
EESH, IF YOUR WEDDING CAKE
SIGNALS "HAZARD AHEAD,"

08:53.363 --> 08:55.866
MAYBE NOT A GREAT SIGN,
COUPLE.

08:57.157 --> 08:59.960
I'M STILL DYING TO HEAR
THE REST OF THAT STORY.

08:59.960 --> 09:02.212
COME ON, TELL ME HOW YOU GUYS
RUINED THE FIRST WEDDING.

09:02.212 --> 09:03.664
RIGHT. WHERE WERE WE?

09:03.664 --> 09:05.756
MOM AND DAD
HAD JUST ANNOUNCED

09:05.756 --> 09:07.588
THEY WERE GONNA GET MARRIED,
AND WE WERE NOT HAPPY.

09:07.588 --> 09:10.090
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE GONNA BE
MY STEP-SISTER.

09:10.090 --> 09:12.052
YOU'RE SUCH AN UPTIGHT
RULE FOLLOWER.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.885
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
BE WEARING THIS TIE.

09:14.885 --> 09:17.557
YOU ARE JUST
INSUFFERABLE.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.850
WHOA, THAT FELT POWERFUL.

09:19.850 --> 09:22.893
THIS IS LIKE A LITTLE
EXCLAMATION POINT TO MY HEAD.

09:22.893 --> 09:27.447
Stan: OH, SO THAT'S WHEN AVERY
FIRST STARTED WEARING TIES.

09:27.447 --> 09:29.780
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS...
AH, WHO AM I KIDDING?

09:29.780 --> 09:32.032
I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

09:32.032 --> 09:33.994
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M GONNA BE

09:33.994 --> 09:35.195
THE STEP-SISTER
OF COUSIN ITT.

09:35.195 --> 09:36.657
I DON'T EVEN GET
THAT REFERENCE.

09:36.657 --> 09:40.370
AND WHY WOULD YOU?
IT'S ONLY CLASSIC TELEVISION.

09:40.370 --> 09:42.252
THIS GENERATION.

09:42.252 --> 09:45.165
KIDS, IT'S GONNA TAKE
FLEXIBILITY AND UNDERSTANDING

09:45.165 --> 09:48.759
ON ALL OUR PARTS TO MAKE
THIS NEW FAMILY WORK.

09:48.759 --> 09:51.882
I'M GONNA DO MY PART
LIVING WITH THIS DECOR...

09:51.882 --> 09:54.765
WHICH I LOVE,
WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING.

09:54.765 --> 09:56.677
AM I RIGHT,
BURGER CLOWN?

09:56.677 --> 09:59.309
SEE, THIS GUY GETS IT.

09:59.309 --> 10:01.642
YOU HAVE FROGS IN THE HOUSE?

10:01.642 --> 10:04.434
I'M TERRIFIED OF FROGS.

10:04.434 --> 10:08.278
IF YOU'RE AFRAID OF FROGS,
JUST BECOME INVISIBLE LIKE ME.

10:11.321 --> 10:13.033
THAT WAS ME.

10:14.655 --> 10:18.198
LISTEN, KIDS, WE ARE
GONNA MAKE THIS TRANSITION
AS SMOOTH AS WE CAN.

10:18.198 --> 10:20.871
AVERY, I'VE ALREADY CLEANED OUT
MY MAN CAVE

10:20.871 --> 10:22.292
SO YOU CAN HAVE
YOUR OWN ROOM.

10:22.292 --> 10:23.333
BEST ROOM IN THE HOUSE.

10:23.333 --> 10:25.245
OH, COOL.
THANK YOU.

10:25.245 --> 10:26.877
IF SOMEONE'S GETTING
DAD'S MAN CAVE,

10:26.877 --> 10:29.419
IT SHOULD BE ME.

10:29.419 --> 10:31.461
WELL, YOU KIDS WORK IT OUT.

10:31.461 --> 10:33.423
YOU WANT TO LET THEM
WORK IT OUT?

10:33.423 --> 10:36.216
AS A CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST,
I CAN ASSURE YOU

10:36.216 --> 10:38.098
THAT THEY WILL BOND BEST
IF THEY DEVELOP

10:38.098 --> 10:40.430
THEIR OWN TOOLS FOR
CONFLICT RESOLUTION.

10:40.430 --> 10:42.392
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE A CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.474
FOR SOME REASON,
I KEEP THINKING

10:44.474 --> 10:48.819
YOU BID ON UNCLAIMED
STORAGE LOCKERS.

10:48.819 --> 10:50.400
THIS GUY GETS IT.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.274
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT TO SAY FOR MY VOWS.

10:54.274 --> 10:56.777
YOU CAN USE MY SPEECH
FROM THE LAST ONE IF YOU WANT.

10:56.777 --> 10:59.449
YOU MEAN JUST STAND THERE
STARING OUT AND GOING

10:59.449 --> 11:01.411
( popping sounds )

11:01.411 --> 11:03.373
THINK I'M TOO OLD FOR THAT.

11:03.373 --> 11:05.085
OR MAYBE TOO YOUNG.

11:05.085 --> 11:07.247
I DIDN'T DO THAT, DID I?

11:07.247 --> 11:09.249
SWEETIE, IT'S ON
THE VIDEO.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.552
( popping sounds )

11:12.552 --> 11:15.465
WHY DID I JUST STAND THERE
MAKING POPPING NOISES?

11:15.465 --> 11:19.509
- YOU SAID THAT YOU
WERE A POP STAR.
- DOES MAKE SENSE.

11:19.509 --> 11:22.222
BUT THAT WASN'T A SPEECH.
WHY DID EVERYBODY CLAP?

11:22.222 --> 11:23.934
BECAUSE SOMEONE
TOLD THEM TO.

11:23.934 --> 11:25.475
Chloe: CLAP, EVERYBODY.
CLAP.

11:26.767 --> 11:28.568
I AM NOT GOING OUT LIKE THAT.

11:28.568 --> 11:30.570
I WILL DO A GREAT SPEECH,

11:30.570 --> 11:32.863
AND BE THE BEST THING
AT THIS NEW WEDDING.

11:32.863 --> 11:35.776
THAT'S JUST WHAT I NEEDED.

11:35.776 --> 11:37.778
ANOTHER HORSE IN THIS RACE.

11:40.660 --> 11:43.033
CALL OF THE WEDDING.

11:43.033 --> 11:45.165
THE DRY CLEANER
SHRUNK MY TUX.

11:47.247 --> 11:49.459
STAN, IT'S NOT BLACK TIE,
AND YOU'RE A DOG.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.091
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WEAR ANYTHING.

11:51.091 --> 11:52.332
AFTER ALL THIS TIME,

11:52.332 --> 11:55.255
YOU STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT MAKES ME TICK, DO YOU?

11:55.255 --> 11:58.178
ANYHOO, CAN YOU GET BACK TO
YOUR WACKY WEDDING STORY?

11:58.178 --> 12:01.341
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
IT WAS THE DAY
OF THE WEDDING.

12:01.341 --> 12:03.974
WE WERE STILL FIGHTING
OVER WHO WAS GONNA GET
THE GOOD BEDROOM.

12:03.974 --> 12:06.396
I KNOW. WE'LL SETTLE THIS
THE WAY THEY DID

12:06.396 --> 12:09.019
DURING THE KLONDIKE
STAMPEDE OF 1897.

12:09.019 --> 12:10.851
LIKE I SAY TO
MY HISTORY TEACHER,

12:10.851 --> 12:14.064
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT IS,
AND PLEASE DON'T EXPLAIN IT.

12:14.064 --> 12:17.197
WHEN GOLD WAS DISCOVERED
IN THE KLONDIKE,

12:17.197 --> 12:19.199
THE RULE WAS,
WHICHEVER PROSPECTOR

12:19.199 --> 12:21.822
GOT TO AN AREA FIRST,
COULD CLAIM IT FOR THEMSELVES.

12:21.822 --> 12:24.124
SO YOU EXPLAINED IT
AND TOLD ME A RULE.

12:24.124 --> 12:26.246
IT JUST KEEPS
GETTING WORSE.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.628
SO AFTER THE VOWS,
WE'LL DO THE SAME THING.

12:28.628 --> 12:30.500
THE FIRST ONE
INTO THE ROOM GETS IT.

12:30.500 --> 12:34.424
DEAL. WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
SAY WE WERE RACING?

12:34.424 --> 12:36.046
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO
TEACH ME SOMETHING?

12:36.046 --> 12:37.297
NOW I HAVE TO GO DO
SOMETHING STUPID

12:37.297 --> 12:39.219
TO GET THE SMARTNESS
OUT OF MY HEAD.

12:39.219 --> 12:41.141
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING.

12:41.141 --> 12:43.763
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING.
YES, I'M BACK.

12:46.056 --> 12:47.597
SO WHEN THE WEDDING
WAS UNDERWAY,

12:47.597 --> 12:49.649
ALL AVERY AND I
COULD THINK ABOUT

12:49.649 --> 12:51.942
WAS POSITIONING OURSELVES
FOR THE RACE TO THE BEDROOM.

12:51.942 --> 12:53.523
OKAY, OKAY,
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.856
( popping sounds )

12:58.989 --> 13:00.821
CLAP, EVERYBODY, CLAP.

13:05.245 --> 13:07.287
HOW ABOUT THAT CHLOE, HUH?

13:07.287 --> 13:10.580
SHE JUST POPS IN
WHENEVER YOU NEED HER. HA HA.

13:12.212 --> 13:14.214
YEAH, GOOD ONE, ELLEN.

13:15.505 --> 13:17.217
THEY LAUGHED WHEN HE SAID
"GOOD ONE, ELLEN."

13:17.217 --> 13:19.629
I'LL HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT.

13:19.629 --> 13:23.053
Stan: AND REMEMBER IT,
SHE WOULD.

13:23.053 --> 13:25.135
I'M SORRY,
YOU'RE TELLING THE STORY.

13:25.135 --> 13:27.427
CONTINUE.

13:27.427 --> 13:30.020
AND NOW, OUR BRIDE AND GROOM
WILL READ THE VOWS

13:30.020 --> 13:31.601
THAT THEY'VE PREPARED.

13:31.601 --> 13:34.814
AFTER YOU.
- NO, PLEASE, AFTER YOU.

13:45.075 --> 13:47.287
THE FROGS, THE FROGS!

13:50.580 --> 13:52.122
ELLEN!

14:00.340 --> 14:02.222
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
OUR WEDDING.

14:02.222 --> 14:05.175
- I'M AFRAID OF FROGS.
- SO AM I,
BUT I'M MORE AFRAID

14:05.175 --> 14:07.727
OF BEING SINGLE.
GET BACK HERE AND MARRY ME.

14:08.768 --> 14:10.350
- DO YOU?
- YES.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.681
- DO YOU?
- YEAH.

14:11.681 --> 14:13.683
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU
HUSBAND AND...

14:13.683 --> 14:15.525
FROG!

14:16.526 --> 14:18.188
I'LL TAKE IT.

14:21.241 --> 14:23.403
HEY, GUYS, I GOT
A CAKE HALF OFF.

14:26.116 --> 14:29.199
WAIT, AVERY. TYLER, I THINK
I JUST REALIZED SOMETHING.

14:29.199 --> 14:31.541
FROGS ON THE LOOSE,
PEOPLE SCREAMING.

14:31.541 --> 14:33.413
ONE OF MY OWNERS
WAS A FLORIST

14:33.413 --> 14:35.125
WHO WOULD TAKE ME
WITH HIM TO WEDDINGS.

14:35.125 --> 14:37.377
THIS ONE TIME,
I SNEAKED OUT OF HIS VAN.

14:37.377 --> 14:41.501
COOL. CAKE ALL OVER
THE FLOOR!

14:41.501 --> 14:44.304
NOW A DOG HAS WANDERED
INTO THE HOUSE.

14:44.304 --> 14:46.346
I HATE DOGS
AS MUCH AS FROGS.

14:46.346 --> 14:50.680
DON'T WORRY, HONEY.
WE WILL NEVER GET A DOG.

14:50.680 --> 14:53.183
HOW DARE YOU?
DOGS ARE WONDERFUL CREATURES.

14:53.183 --> 14:56.226
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'M GONNA GO THROW UP
IN YOUR KITCHEN.

14:58.148 --> 15:00.230
THAT'S AMAZING.
YOU WERE AT THE WEDDING?

15:00.230 --> 15:02.572
AND YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO THREW UP IN THE KITCHEN?

15:02.572 --> 15:05.025
GRANDMA GOT BLAMED FOR THAT.

15:05.025 --> 15:08.118
AH, LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT
WHO PUKED WHERE.

15:08.118 --> 15:10.370
SO AFTER THE WEDDING
GOT MESSED UP,

15:10.370 --> 15:12.082
IS THAT WHEN YOU BEAT
TYLER UP TO THE ROOM?

15:12.082 --> 15:14.334
ACTUALLY,
I GOT THERE FIRST,
SO IT WAS MY ROOM.

15:14.334 --> 15:16.456
BUT I GAVE IT TO AVERY
WHEN I COULDN'T DEAL WITH

15:16.456 --> 15:18.999
ALL THE HORRIBLE
BATHROOM NOISES.

15:18.999 --> 15:21.171
( groaning sounds
in bathroom )

15:25.675 --> 15:28.388
- OH!
- ( groaning and
sounds of flatulence )

15:28.388 --> 15:30.850
COME ON!

15:30.850 --> 15:32.472
WHAT?

15:32.472 --> 15:34.394
THAT'S THE QUIETEST ROOM
IN THE HOUSE.

15:34.394 --> 15:36.016
THAT'S WHY I'M
ALWAYS IN THERE.

15:36.016 --> 15:38.768
OH, AND BECAUSE
I LOVE OUR TALKS.

15:38.768 --> 15:41.611
LOVE OUR TALKS.

15:41.611 --> 15:44.864
OH, MY GOSH.
I FORGOT, TYLER.

15:44.864 --> 15:47.988
YOU THOUGHT THOSE BATHROOM
NOISES WERE REAL.

15:47.988 --> 15:49.569
OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA
THINK THIS IS FUNNY.

15:49.569 --> 15:50.991
THOSE WEREN'T
BATHROOM NOISES.

15:50.991 --> 15:52.662
I TRICKED YOU WITH
A RECORDING I MADE

15:52.662 --> 15:54.374
OF AN ELEPHANT GIVING BIRTH.

15:54.374 --> 15:57.207
( Stan guffaws )

15:57.207 --> 15:58.838
YOU TRICKED ME?

15:58.838 --> 16:00.250
I GAVE UP THE GOOD ROOM,

16:00.250 --> 16:02.422
AND I'VE BEEN POTTY QUIET
FOR NOTHING?

16:02.422 --> 16:05.345
I KNOW.
IT'S HILARIOUS.

16:05.345 --> 16:08.348
NO, IT ISN'T.
THAT ROOM SHOULD BE MINE.

16:08.348 --> 16:11.301
INSTEAD, I'M STUCK IN
A TINY ROOM NEXT TO MOM AND DAD.

16:11.301 --> 16:13.473
MOM WAKES ME UP EVERY MORNING
SCREAMING THROUGH THE WALL,

16:13.473 --> 16:15.555
"DON'T BE LATE FOR
SCHOOL!"

16:15.555 --> 16:17.437
FOR THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS,
I THOUGHT THE HOUSE WAS HAUNTED

16:17.437 --> 16:20.480
BY A VERY PUNCTUAL GHOST.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.272
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU WOULD DO THAT TO ME.

16:22.272 --> 16:25.775
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU'RE SO UPSET.

16:25.775 --> 16:27.277
IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO.

16:27.277 --> 16:29.659
BUT I'M JUST FINDING OUT
ABOUT IT NOW.

16:29.659 --> 16:30.950
IT'S LIKE IT JUST HAPPENED,

16:30.950 --> 16:33.323
AND EVEN IF IT HAPPENED
TWO YEARS AGO,

16:33.323 --> 16:34.414
IT'S BEEN HAPPENING EVERY DAY
SINCE THEN,

16:34.414 --> 16:36.246
BECAUSE YOU'VE
KEPT THE ROOM.

16:36.246 --> 16:38.038
YOU STILL HAVE THE ROOM.
IT'S STILL HAPPENING.

16:38.038 --> 16:40.170
I'M SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY,
BUT TO ME,

16:40.170 --> 16:42.542
IT WAS SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENED BACK WHEN
WE BOTH HATED EACH OTHER.

16:42.542 --> 16:45.295
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE WERE DIFFERENT
BACK THEN.

16:45.295 --> 16:47.467
YOU WERE SOBBIER,
I WAS DUMBER,
BUT I THOUGHT WE HAD

16:47.467 --> 16:49.929
A SALUTARY INFLUENCE
ON EACH OTHER.

16:49.929 --> 16:52.052
BECAUSE OF YOU, I NOW SAY
THINGS LIKE SALUTARY INFLUENCE.

16:52.052 --> 16:53.633
- I USED THAT
CORRECTLY, RIGHT?
- YES.

16:53.633 --> 16:55.305
GOOD, 'CAUSE I WASN'T SURE
FOR A SEC.

16:55.305 --> 16:58.188
THE POINT IS,
I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS.

17:01.101 --> 17:02.942
I FEEL BAD ABOUT THIS.

17:02.942 --> 17:04.444
I THOUGHT HE'D THINK
IT WAS FUNNY.

17:04.444 --> 17:06.406
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE WORST PART IS?

17:06.406 --> 17:09.239
YOU JUST KNOW HE'S GONNA
STOP BEING POTTY QUIET.

17:13.783 --> 17:14.994
HEY, KID.

17:14.994 --> 17:17.747
STAN, I AM FREAKING OUT
ABOUT MY SPEECH.

17:17.747 --> 17:20.039
IT'S GOTTA BE REALLY
GOOD THIS TIME.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.711
I'M NOT SOME FIVE-YEAR-OLD

17:21.711 --> 17:24.214
RUNNING AROUND MAKING
CRAZY MOUTH NOISES.

17:24.214 --> 17:26.126
( popping )

17:26.126 --> 17:28.338
AS FUN AS THAT IS.

17:28.338 --> 17:30.220
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT SO FAR?

17:30.220 --> 17:31.591
HERE'S MY OPENING JOKE.

17:31.591 --> 17:33.763
GOT BIG LAUGHS
IN SCHOOL TODAY.

17:33.763 --> 17:35.805
BOOGER.

17:35.805 --> 17:38.228
( laughs )

17:38.228 --> 17:40.940
BOOGER.
CLASSIC.

17:42.272 --> 17:44.063
LET ME GIVE YOU A TIP
FROM MY DAYS

17:44.063 --> 17:46.065
AS AN UNDER-THE-TABLE
TOASTMASTER.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.607
JUST FROM YOUR HEART.

17:47.607 --> 17:50.280
AND IF YOU HAVE TO DO COMEDY,
USE FOOD, PREFERABLY PICKLES.

17:50.280 --> 17:52.992
IT'S THE FUNNIEST FOOD.
NO ONE KNOWS WHY.

17:52.992 --> 17:54.784
NOW YOU TELL ME.

17:54.784 --> 17:57.497
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING
WITH THESE ALL DAY.

17:57.497 --> 17:59.999
BABY CORN, MOMMY CORN.

17:59.999 --> 18:02.122
( baby voice )
WHERE'S DADDY?

18:02.122 --> 18:04.254
REMEMBER THAT POPCORN
WE HAD LAST NIGHT?

18:04.254 --> 18:06.706
( shrieks )

18:12.802 --> 18:14.514
SO, MOM,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

18:14.514 --> 18:17.137
OH, SWEETIE, THIS
IS SUCH A LOVELY
ANNIVERSARY PRESENT

18:17.137 --> 18:19.269
YOU KIDS PUT TOGETHER
FOR US.

18:19.269 --> 18:20.890
AND I THINK I FINALLY
FIGURED OUT MY VOWS.

18:20.890 --> 18:22.272
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK.

18:22.272 --> 18:24.274
OUR LOVE IS LIKE A GIFT,

18:24.274 --> 18:26.856
AND EVERY GIFT
NEEDS WRAPPING.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.358
AND SPEAKING OF RAPPING,

18:28.358 --> 18:30.029
OH, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
RAP YOUR VOWS, ARE YOU?

18:30.029 --> 18:32.612
NO! NO.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.445
NOT ANYMORE.

18:35.445 --> 18:38.328
HEY, TYLER, WHAT DO YOU
THINK ABOUT ME REFERRING TO MOM

18:38.328 --> 18:41.201
AS "MY TWINKLE-EYED MUSE"?

18:41.201 --> 18:43.623
I THINK IT'D BE FUNNY.
IS THAT WHAT YOU
WERE GOING FOR?

18:47.417 --> 18:48.878
HEY, TYLER.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.670
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT,

18:50.670 --> 18:52.382
AND I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE UPSET.

18:52.382 --> 18:54.674
I GET HOW THIS FEELS
LIKE IT JUST HAPPENED NOW,

18:54.674 --> 18:58.057
AND IT'S BEEN WRONG OF ME
TO KEEP THE ROOM THESE
PAST TWO YEARS.

18:58.057 --> 19:00.600
AND YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT
HOW WE'VE INFLUENCED
EACH OTHER.

19:00.600 --> 19:04.474
YOU'VE HELPED ME
BE MORE CHILL-IFIED.

19:04.474 --> 19:06.566
BECAUSE OF YOU, I NOW SAY
THINGS LIKE CHILL-IFIED.

19:06.566 --> 19:08.438
I'VE NEVER SAID CHILL-IFIED.

19:08.438 --> 19:10.400
I KNOW. I MADE IT UP.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.941
BECAUSE OF YOU, I NOW
MAKE UP WORDS

19:11.941 --> 19:14.234
NOT JUST BASED ON
LATIN ROOTS.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.577
AND WE ARE FRIENDS.

19:17.577 --> 19:20.159
SORRY THAT I DIDN'T
TREAT YOU LIKE ONE.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.411
I WANT YOU TO HAVE
THE ROOM BACK.

19:21.411 --> 19:23.333
THANKS, AVERY.
THAT'S FAIR.

19:23.333 --> 19:25.245
AFTER THE WEDDING,
I'LL MOVE MY STUFF IN.

19:25.245 --> 19:27.707
OKAY. AND I'LL GO INTO
WHAT WILL NOW BE MY ROOM

19:27.707 --> 19:29.549
AND VACUUM ALL THE HAIR
OUT OF THE CARPET.

19:29.549 --> 19:31.671
THERE'S NO CARPET IN THERE.

19:31.671 --> 19:35.425
BUT IT'S WALL TO WALL.

19:35.425 --> 19:37.176
TO BEGIN THE CEREMONY,
WE'LL HEAR FROM

19:37.176 --> 19:39.349
THE YOUNGEST MEMBER OF
THE JENNINGS-JAMES FAMILY,

19:39.349 --> 19:40.600
CHLOE.

19:45.104 --> 19:46.516
HI.

19:46.516 --> 19:48.728
TWO YEARS AGO, WHEN
MOMMY AND DADDY GOT MARRIED,

19:48.728 --> 19:51.811
I GOT A FAMILY THAT
I LOVE MORE THAN ANYTHING.

19:51.811 --> 19:54.023
ESPECIALLY HOW WE
FORGIVE EACH OTHER,

19:54.023 --> 19:56.406
AND GIVE EACH OTHER A CHANCE
TO FIX OUR MISTAKES.

19:56.406 --> 19:59.239
JUST LIKE I'M GETTING
ANOTHER CHANCE TO DO MY SPEECH,

19:59.239 --> 20:02.782
BECAUSE MY FAMILY LOVES ME,
EVEN WHEN I MESS UP.

20:02.782 --> 20:07.327
- THANK YOU. BOOGER.
- ( laughter )

20:07.327 --> 20:09.499
I KNEW THAT WOULD WORK.

20:09.499 --> 20:11.130
THANK YOU, CHLOE.

20:13.543 --> 20:14.924
WE'RE GATHERED HERE TODAY...

20:14.924 --> 20:16.546
YOU KNOW, CHLOE'S RIGHT.

20:16.546 --> 20:19.929
WE FORGIVE EACH OTHER.
YOU CAN KEEP THE ROOM.

20:19.929 --> 20:23.893
NO, SHE'S ALSO RIGHT
ABOUT GETTING A CHANCE
TO FIX OUR MISTAKES.

20:23.893 --> 20:25.435
I MADE A MISTAKE.
IT'S YOUR ROOM NOW.

20:25.435 --> 20:28.227
AVERY, PLEASE, JUST LET ME
BE THE BIGGER PERSON HERE.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.979
YOU CAN'T BE
THE BIGGER PERSON.

20:29.979 --> 20:32.191
I'M ALWAYS THE BIGGER PERSON,
EXCEPT FOR PHYSICALLY,

20:32.191 --> 20:35.194
WHICH IS WHY MY EMOTIONAL
SIZE IS THAT MUCH MORE
IMPORTANT TO ME.

20:35.194 --> 20:37.317
MY EMOTIONAL SIZE
IS IMPORTANT TO ME, TOO.

20:37.317 --> 20:39.449
I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD ONE
UNTIL TWO SECONDS AGO,

20:39.449 --> 20:41.281
BUT NOW, IT'S
ALL I CARE ABOUT.

20:41.281 --> 20:43.242
SEE HOW EMOTIONALLY
BIG I AM?

20:43.242 --> 20:45.705
FORGET IT, TYLER.

20:45.705 --> 20:48.127
I AM GOING UP TO
YOUR ROOM RIGHT NOW,

20:48.127 --> 20:49.289
AND I'M TAKING
ALL MY STUFF OUT.

20:49.289 --> 20:51.421
- OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT.
- YEAH, I AM.

20:51.421 --> 20:53.423
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

20:54.374 --> 20:56.716
THE FROGS!

20:56.716 --> 20:58.007
THE FROGS!

21:01.721 --> 21:03.433
ELLEN!

21:06.436 --> 21:09.188
WHERE DID THESE FROGS
COME FROM?

21:09.188 --> 21:11.100
FROM ME.

21:11.100 --> 21:14.023
I GOT YOU FROGS TO REPLACE
THE ONES YOU GOT RID OF
FOR ME TWO YEARS AGO.

21:14.023 --> 21:16.065
REALLY?

21:16.065 --> 21:18.488
OH, HONEY,
THAT IS SO THOUGHTFUL.

21:18.488 --> 21:21.611
BENNETT, LET'S NOT EVEN
SAY OUR VOWS.

21:21.611 --> 21:24.243
THEY WOULD NEVER TOP
WHAT CHLOE SAID.

21:24.243 --> 21:26.496
EVEN THOUGH MINE WOULD'VE
KICKED YOURS' BUTT.

21:26.496 --> 21:29.078
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING, DO YOU?

21:29.078 --> 21:30.960
NO, I DON'T.

21:30.960 --> 21:34.253
I WIN... BECAUSE
I HAVE YOU.

21:34.253 --> 21:35.965
EH?

21:35.965 --> 21:36.966
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING EITHER.

21:36.966 --> 21:39.178
NO, I DO NOT.

21:39.178 --> 21:41.471
- I LOVE YOU.
- I LOVE YOU, TOO.

21:46.265 --> 21:48.187
I REALLY ENJOYED
HEARING THE STORY

21:48.187 --> 21:50.269
OF HOW THE KIDS
MET EACH OTHER,

21:50.269 --> 21:52.642
AND HOW MUCH THEY'VE GROWN
INTO A REAL FAMILY.

21:54.273 --> 21:56.436
AND TYLER AND AVERY
DECIDED THAT AVERY

21:56.436 --> 21:58.858
WILL KEEP HER ROOM UNTIL
SHE GOES OFF TO COLLEGE.

21:58.858 --> 22:02.201
THEN TYLER WILL GET IT
UNTIL HE FINISHES HIGH SCHOOL.

22:02.201 --> 22:04.744
AND THE BEST PART
OF THE WEDDING REDO

22:04.744 --> 22:07.206
WAS THE UNDER-THE-TABLE
TOAST.

22:07.206 --> 22:10.910
ELLEN, BENNETT,

22:10.910 --> 22:13.042
YOU'RE INSPIRING,

22:13.042 --> 22:15.124
THE WAY YOU'VE
BROUGHT THIS FAMILY TOGETHER.

22:15.124 --> 22:17.216
JUST REMEMBER,
THE KEY TO A SUCCESSFUL MARRIAGE

22:17.216 --> 22:20.670
IS NEVER GO TO BED ANGRY,
LISTEN TO EACH OTHER,

22:20.670 --> 22:23.423
AND IF HE SCRATCHES ON
THE DOOR LATE AT NIGHT,

22:23.423 --> 22:26.466
LET HIM OUT.
HE JUST HAS TO PEE.

22:26.466 --> 22:28.558
I LOVE YOU GUYS.

22:28.558 --> 22:30.430
Ellen: WHO WAS
THAT, BENNETT?

22:30.430 --> 22:33.182
Bennett: PROBABLY SOMEONE
FROM YOUR SIDE OF THE FAMILY.
