<i>Nine years ago I witnessed</i>
<i>my mother's murder.</i>

00:03.775 --> 00:06.694
<i>I would have been killed, too,</i>
<i>if it hadn't been for Vincent.</i>

00:06.696 --> 00:09.647
<i>I was part of an experimental</i>
<i>special forces group.</i>

00:09.649 --> 00:11.682
<i>Their goal was to create</i>
<i>the perfect super soldier.</i>

00:11.684 --> 00:13.150
<i>But something went wrong.</i>

00:13.152 --> 00:14.702
You're him.

00:14.704 --> 00:15.870
The most
eligible bachelor

00:15.872 --> 00:18.005
has reverted to online dating?
Claire Sinclair?

00:18.007 --> 00:19.507
<i>Evan's getting closer</i>
<i>and closer.</i>

00:19.509 --> 00:22.460
It's him.
It's our creature.

00:22.462 --> 00:24.629
I managed to disrupt
one of his studies.

00:24.631 --> 00:26.781
- Vincent Keller.
<i>- Who is she?</i>

00:26.783 --> 00:28.466
<i>We were pretty close.</i>

00:28.468 --> 00:30.518
<i>Why didn't you tell me</i>
<i>you were engaged?</i>

00:30.520 --> 00:32.853
Alex is willing to give up
her life

00:32.855 --> 00:34.055
to go with me.

00:34.057 --> 00:36.357
<i>My enemies are still out there.</i>

00:36.359 --> 00:37.808
<i>And they want me dead.</i>

00:39.394 --> 00:41.195
You ripped those men apart.

00:41.197 --> 00:42.446
I would never hurt you.

00:42.448 --> 00:43.531
I can't.

00:43.533 --> 00:44.966
We can't.

00:44.968 --> 00:46.517
It was never about

00:46.519 --> 00:48.185
taking off with Alex.

00:48.187 --> 00:50.504
It was about a better future
for me.

00:50.506 --> 00:52.740
Vincent,
I can't be your second choice.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074

01:19.051 --> 01:20.184
Hello.

01:20.186 --> 01:21.986
Go down the back stairs.

01:21.988 --> 01:23.154
Out the side door

01:23.156 --> 01:25.322
<i>and around the corner.</i>

01:33.865 --> 01:35.750
Earl's Diner
around the corner.

01:35.752 --> 01:38.002
You used our credit card
to buy breakfast.

01:38.004 --> 01:39.253
You're following me?

01:39.255 --> 01:41.922
If I can track you down this
easily, so can Muirfield.

01:41.924 --> 01:43.257
They're everywhere.

01:43.259 --> 01:45.676
How is that even possible?

01:45.678 --> 01:48.078
I don't know.

01:48.080 --> 01:50.514
But you saw it for yourself
in the woods.

01:50.516 --> 01:52.583
They're hunting Vincent.

01:52.585 --> 01:54.602
And now that they know
your connection to him,

01:54.604 --> 01:56.587
they are
hunting you, too.

01:56.589 --> 01:59.106
You need to be more careful.

01:59.108 --> 02:01.008
How?

02:01.010 --> 02:04.094
You can start by trusting me.

02:04.096 --> 02:07.615
And by checking into
a new hotel.

02:07.617 --> 02:10.401
Under a different name,
with cash.

02:10.402 --> 02:14.321
I have some friends
from my activist days.

02:14.323 --> 02:15.823
They can help me.

02:15.825 --> 02:17.107
Maybe help Vincent, too.

02:17.109 --> 02:20.010
You will only put them
in danger.

02:20.012 --> 02:23.464
Okay, I got you this.

02:24.549 --> 02:26.233
It's a burner phone.
I have one, too.

02:26.235 --> 02:28.385
You can only use it for three
days and then get rid of it.

02:28.387 --> 02:31.138
I'll call you with my new number
before you do.

02:31.140 --> 02:35.342
Obviously you can only use cash
from here on out.

02:35.344 --> 02:36.844
You can pay me back later,

02:36.846 --> 02:38.479
but I need your credit cards.

02:38.481 --> 02:40.147
I want to trust you,

02:40.149 --> 02:43.801
but we can't risk
you using them again.

02:53.612 --> 02:56.163
This isn't happening.

02:57.332 --> 02:58.866
Can I ask
you something?

02:58.868 --> 03:00.000
Yeah.

03:00.002 --> 03:03.287
How can you just...

03:03.289 --> 03:07.825
put yourself out there
like this for him?

03:07.827 --> 03:09.493
Knowing what he is.

03:09.495 --> 03:11.712
He saved my life.

03:13.682 --> 03:16.684
And that's all he wants
for you, too.

03:26.361 --> 03:29.280
♪ I'm walking home tonight ♪

03:29.282 --> 03:33.517
♪ With shopping in my hands
and music in my ears. ♪

03:33.519 --> 03:35.018
What are you doing?
Geez.

03:35.020 --> 03:36.620
Sorry.

03:36.622 --> 03:37.688
Didn't mean to scare you.

03:37.690 --> 03:39.156
No, it's okay.

03:39.158 --> 03:41.075
A shot of adrenaline is exactly
what I needed to wake up.

03:41.077 --> 03:43.294
Well, you want to switch
to a sugar high?

03:43.296 --> 03:47.414
Pass, but very subtle letting me
know that you have a valentine.

03:47.416 --> 03:50.334
Well, actually
I don't... yet.

03:50.336 --> 03:51.368
I bought these myself.

03:51.370 --> 03:52.720
But you know what?

03:52.722 --> 03:54.255
This is my way of taking back
Valentine's Day;

03:54.257 --> 03:55.472
determining my own fate.

03:55.474 --> 03:57.391
And once I meet
Mr. Destiny tonight,

03:57.393 --> 04:00.261
all of my preemptive purchases
will be vindicated.

04:00.263 --> 04:02.396
What do you means <i>purchases?</i>

04:02.398 --> 04:04.181
Oh, I also made a dinner
reservation for two

04:04.183 --> 04:05.549
at my favorite restaurant.

04:05.551 --> 04:07.401
Seriously?
What?

04:07.403 --> 04:09.219
Perks of actually having
a paycheck now,

04:09.221 --> 04:11.572
thanks to my new job

04:11.574 --> 04:14.074
as Event Coordinator
for Haskins and Geller.

04:14.076 --> 04:15.392
"Servicing the city."

04:15.394 --> 04:17.327
Thank you, big sis.

04:17.329 --> 04:19.062
I thought that I got you
that job so that

04:19.064 --> 04:21.565
you could pay for at least
a fraction of the rent.

04:21.567 --> 04:22.833
Whatever.

04:22.835 --> 04:24.251
Valentine's Day

04:24.253 --> 04:26.904
is not about math,
it's about love.

04:26.906 --> 04:29.590
Who knows where the day
will take me.

04:29.592 --> 04:31.408
Maybe you should try it.

04:31.410 --> 04:36.297
♪ I don't know how much I should
read into your smile ♪

04:36.299 --> 04:39.800
♪ It's playing with my heart. ♪

04:41.085 --> 04:42.803
You don't have to worry
about Alex.

04:42.805 --> 04:44.521
I, uh, gave her some money

04:44.523 --> 04:47.925
and some tips on the finer
points of becoming a ghost.

04:47.927 --> 04:49.777
So, she's okay?

04:49.779 --> 04:52.479
Yeah, she took it
as well as she could.

04:52.481 --> 04:54.648
Thank you for,
uh, doing that.

04:54.650 --> 04:56.083
Of course.

04:56.085 --> 04:58.402
I guess she just
needs some time.

04:58.404 --> 05:00.404
She's not the only one.

05:03.441 --> 05:07.728
Look, uh, I know I promised
I would give you some space,

05:07.730 --> 05:10.497
but I actually came here
to see if you're free tonight.

05:10.499 --> 05:13.334
What-what,
like Valentine's Day plans?

05:13.336 --> 05:14.501
Seriously?

05:14.503 --> 05:16.720
Yeah, I know
my timing sucks, but...

05:16.722 --> 05:20.290
I don't want to have to wait
a whole nother year.

05:20.292 --> 05:23.727
Seems I've already, uh, missed
a few opportunities with you.

05:23.729 --> 05:25.746
Vincent, I'm protecting you.

05:25.748 --> 05:28.315
Please don't mistake this
as anything else.

05:29.351 --> 05:30.634
Okay.

05:30.636 --> 05:34.021
♪ I need a change...

05:34.023 --> 05:36.824
What... what we had, I...

05:36.826 --> 05:39.293
I actually let myself want it.

05:39.295 --> 05:41.278
And the second

05:41.280 --> 05:44.865
you saw Alex,
you-you turned away.

05:44.867 --> 05:47.251
How am I supposed to trust
that you'll be there?

05:47.253 --> 05:50.838
Catherine, it was never even
about Alex.

05:50.840 --> 05:53.457
It was just me trying to live
some fantasy life.

05:53.459 --> 05:55.843
You know, one where I might seem
normal again.

05:55.845 --> 05:57.678
What I felt for you,

05:57.680 --> 06:00.163
it never went away.

06:00.165 --> 06:02.049
Never. Not for one second.

06:07.022 --> 06:09.523
So, uh, what now?

06:09.525 --> 06:12.142
We make sure
that your ex-fiancée

06:12.144 --> 06:13.444
doesn't slip up again.

06:13.446 --> 06:15.229
They find her, they find you.

06:15.231 --> 06:17.197
I'll let you know
when she calls me.

06:31.296 --> 06:32.413
Hey.

06:32.415 --> 06:33.797
Sorry I'm late.

06:33.799 --> 06:35.699
What, did you come
by way of Jersey?

06:36.969 --> 06:38.201
I was at work.

06:38.203 --> 06:39.803
I switched cabs
like you told me.

06:39.805 --> 06:41.472
So, you weren't followed?

06:41.474 --> 06:43.841
Alex, what's going on?

06:43.843 --> 06:45.375
I've never seen you
like this before.

06:45.377 --> 06:48.228
I've never been running
for my life before.

06:48.230 --> 06:50.314
Is that why you haven't been
at home or at work

06:50.316 --> 06:51.982
in the last few days?

06:51.984 --> 06:53.317
I'm a journalist.

06:53.319 --> 06:54.985
I have to check
my source's stories.

06:54.987 --> 06:56.687
Even if they
are old friends.

06:56.689 --> 06:58.238
Well, this isn't
some insider information

06:58.240 --> 06:59.990
on corporate
union-busting, Arlin.

06:59.992 --> 07:04.411
What I'm about to tell you
is insane.

07:04.413 --> 07:06.697
But it's true.

07:06.699 --> 07:07.998
And you can't publish
a word of it

07:08.000 --> 07:09.083
or people will die.

07:09.085 --> 07:10.667
Oh, okay.

07:10.669 --> 07:13.037
What is it, Alex?

07:13.039 --> 07:15.622
Someone I know,
he's in way over his head.

07:15.624 --> 07:18.241
He's had a horrible injustice
done to him.

07:18.243 --> 07:20.677
And it's all
been covered up.

07:20.679 --> 07:22.930
I need you to look into it.

07:22.932 --> 07:24.765
I need you to look into
what happened to him;

07:24.767 --> 07:26.433
see if you can find anyone
that I can talk to

07:26.435 --> 07:27.601
and get some help.

07:27.603 --> 07:29.186
All right.

07:32.757 --> 07:36.193
Why don't you tell me
what you do know?

07:36.195 --> 07:38.529
My friend,
Vincent Keller,

07:38.531 --> 07:40.814
he was a soldier.

07:40.816 --> 07:43.617
He was turned into a monster
in an experiment

07:43.619 --> 07:46.403
by a group called Muirfield.

Catherine still got
her force field up

08:05.701 --> 08:07.918
after the
whole Alex thing?

08:07.920 --> 08:10.087
Oh, yeah.

08:10.089 --> 08:13.406
I never should have tried
to make it work with Alex.

08:13.408 --> 08:14.958
You had a history,
you needed to see it through.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.044
Yeah, tell Catherine that.

08:18.679 --> 08:20.347
Brutally honest,

08:20.349 --> 08:22.799
I kind of get
where she's coming from.

08:22.801 --> 08:26.920
Catherine doesn't exactly
wear her heart on her sleeve,

08:26.922 --> 08:28.889
then she open up and wham,

08:28.891 --> 08:31.108
you're MIA with your ex-fiancée.

08:31.110 --> 08:34.443
Not a huge surprise her trust
is running on empty.

08:34.446 --> 08:36.363
She knows I'll always
be there for her.

08:36.365 --> 08:38.030
Knowing you'll always be there

08:38.033 --> 08:40.067
to rip someone limb from limb
in a pinch

08:40.068 --> 08:43.269
is a little different
than knowing

08:43.270 --> 08:45.438
you're not going to start
playing Ice Castles

08:45.440 --> 08:47.157
with the next hot chick
who comes along.

08:47.159 --> 08:49.709
Okay, thank you,
you're really not helping.

08:50.995 --> 08:52.295
No, it's fine.

08:52.297 --> 08:54.381
I'll just have to win
her trust back.

08:56.283 --> 08:58.301
What?

08:59.720 --> 09:02.305
You need to woo her.

09:02.307 --> 09:04.174
It <i>is</i> Valentine's Day.

09:04.176 --> 09:05.308
Woo.

09:05.310 --> 09:07.010
What does that even mean?

09:07.012 --> 09:11.765
And please do not
say folded paper roses.

09:11.767 --> 09:13.984
Okay, first, it's origami.

09:13.986 --> 09:17.320
It's the time-honored art
of a rich culture.

09:17.322 --> 09:21.441
Second, you got to embrace
the cheese factor.

09:21.443 --> 09:23.160
Making a mockery
of your manhood

09:23.162 --> 09:26.913
for one day,
and serving up the romance

09:26.915 --> 09:28.198
on an overpriced platter.

09:28.200 --> 09:32.752
Okay, and I trust
your opinion on

09:32.754 --> 09:33.987
what women want
because...?

09:33.989 --> 09:35.321
I looked it up online.

09:35.323 --> 09:37.924
Ah.

10:04.402 --> 10:05.552
Great.

10:09.690 --> 10:12.242
Miranda's flying back early
from her business trip.

10:12.743 --> 10:14.878
Tonight.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.496
It's bad timing,
I know.

10:16.498 --> 10:19.532
Yeah, right on Valentine's Day.

10:19.534 --> 10:20.917
Look at me.

10:20.919 --> 10:24.721
You know if I could be with you,
I would, right?

10:26.841 --> 10:28.091
I'm sorry.

10:28.093 --> 10:30.210
As bad-ass as I may seem

10:30.212 --> 10:31.811
with all of my biting,
bitchy repartee,

10:31.813 --> 10:32.979
I'm not this person.

10:32.981 --> 10:34.481
I know.

10:34.483 --> 10:37.217
I've never done anything
like this in my life.

10:37.219 --> 10:39.736
I keep imagining
your kid, your wife.

10:39.738 --> 10:42.756
Miranda and I haven't had
a real marriage in years, Tess.

10:44.275 --> 10:46.443
And I will protect my boy,

10:46.445 --> 10:49.246
but I'm done giving up my life
for appearances.

10:52.066 --> 10:54.167
It-it's just...

10:54.169 --> 10:56.203
If you say complicated,

10:56.205 --> 10:58.538
I'm stabbing you
in your sleep next time.

11:02.177 --> 11:05.178
I told myself
to kick you to the curb.

11:05.180 --> 11:07.013
Well, how's that
working out for you?

11:08.300 --> 11:10.767
I haven't decided yet.

11:14.972 --> 11:18.441
<i>Thank you so much</i>

11:18.443 --> 11:21.278
I'm so psyched that the first
event is planning your award.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.730
First of all, it's not my award,
it's my lieutenant's.

11:23.732 --> 11:26.383
And secondly,
it is not the Oscars.

11:26.385 --> 11:28.434
Okay, still, I want
it to be great.

11:28.436 --> 11:30.370
Even if I am just
the clipboard girl.

11:48.590 --> 11:49.622
Sorry.

11:49.624 --> 11:51.925
I'm not. Darius.

11:53.627 --> 11:55.795
Heather. Chandler.

11:55.797 --> 11:57.397
My sister
works here

11:57.399 --> 12:00.133
and I'm doing an event
for some big mucky-muck.

12:00.135 --> 12:02.352
Are you a lawyer
or something?

12:02.354 --> 12:04.187
Something.

12:04.189 --> 12:06.089
Just stopped by
to see my big brother.

12:06.091 --> 12:07.407
The mucky-muck.

12:07.409 --> 12:08.408
No.

12:08.410 --> 12:09.526
Yep.

12:09.528 --> 12:10.493
God.

12:10.495 --> 12:11.745
All good.

12:11.747 --> 12:12.746

12:12.748 --> 12:15.282

12:36.837 --> 12:38.221
A secret admirer.

12:38.223 --> 12:40.140
I read the card.

12:40.142 --> 12:41.858
You can't read
someone else's card.

12:41.860 --> 12:44.027
Well, I did. So?

12:44.029 --> 12:45.612
I don't know who
they're from.

12:45.614 --> 12:46.846
Oh, come on.

12:46.848 --> 12:48.348
There was
the mystery date

12:48.350 --> 12:49.682
to the wedding
who cancelled,

12:49.684 --> 12:51.735
the guy last week
who ran back to his ex,

12:51.737 --> 12:53.019
now this.

12:53.021 --> 12:54.204
You're either having

12:54.206 --> 12:55.538
a very serious
relationship

12:55.540 --> 12:57.907
or a very serious
psychotic break.

12:57.909 --> 12:59.859
Cut flowers.
What do cut flowers have to do with

12:59.861 --> 13:01.961
honestly loving or
trusting somebody?

13:01.963 --> 13:04.331
Mm, I knew it.
Issues much?

13:05.383 --> 13:06.883
Vargas, Chandler,

13:06.885 --> 13:08.134
I'd like you to meet
my brother.

13:08.136 --> 13:09.336
This is Darius.

13:09.338 --> 13:11.221
Joe talks about you
all the time.

13:11.223 --> 13:12.972
Chandler. I think
I ran into your sister.

13:12.974 --> 13:14.724
She's getting you all
hooked up for this event.

13:14.726 --> 13:17.427
Joe deserves the best.

13:17.429 --> 13:18.865
Careful, can't have him
getting a big head.

13:18.890 --> 13:19.847
Hey.

13:19.848 --> 13:21.815
Too late.

13:23.268 --> 13:25.452
So, uh, you two see

13:25.454 --> 13:27.103
the new case that
just came in?

13:28.155 --> 13:29.322
Suicide?

13:29.324 --> 13:31.891
Uni on the scene
thought he found

13:31.893 --> 13:33.443
signs of
a struggle.

13:33.445 --> 13:35.862
Maybe someone's
bloody valentine?

13:35.864 --> 13:37.247
We're on it.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.117
Speaking of
valentines...

13:44.004 --> 13:45.738
I can't
accept them.

13:45.740 --> 13:47.307
And what better
way to keep your

13:47.309 --> 13:49.459
secret admirer on his toes?

13:49.461 --> 13:52.712
Trust me, it'll take
a lot more than roses.

13:57.551 --> 13:59.686
You said there were
signs of a struggle?

13:59.688 --> 14:01.020
Bullet through
the head.

14:01.022 --> 14:02.639
Thought it was a clean suicide,

14:02.641 --> 14:04.724
but then I noticed this.

14:06.310 --> 14:09.396
Homicide's bumped this
to Special Crimes.

14:13.451 --> 14:15.135
Jilted lover?

14:15.137 --> 14:17.036
Anyone who might have
had motive to set him up?

14:17.038 --> 14:19.105
Well, his family
is down in Pennsylvania.

14:19.107 --> 14:21.324
No known girlfriends,
boyfriends.

14:21.326 --> 14:22.625
Looks like he was a journalist.

14:22.627 --> 14:24.277
Greenwich <i>Intelliger.</i>

14:24.279 --> 14:26.629
Aren't they known
for pretty scathing exposés?

14:26.631 --> 14:29.232
Maybe it was a story
someone wanted silenced.

14:29.234 --> 14:32.635
Okay, a journalist
without a laptop?

14:32.637 --> 14:34.170
It was probably stolen
along with any stories

14:34.172 --> 14:35.722
and research that were on it.

14:37.675 --> 14:40.059
Hey.

14:40.061 --> 14:41.961
I'm guessing it fell out
when he was attacked.

14:41.963 --> 14:43.513
Maybe from the bag?

14:43.515 --> 14:45.765
Perp probably missed it
when they took the laptop.

14:51.439 --> 14:52.872
You know, if someone
did this clean

14:52.874 --> 14:55.641
a job to kill this guy
and take his computer,

14:55.643 --> 14:59.279
they may have been covering
up one hell of a story.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.481
I'm glad you're back

15:12.484 --> 15:14.368
and I trust you won't
be given any demerits

15:14.370 --> 15:16.903
for our late lunch.

15:16.905 --> 15:18.705
Busy afternoon?

15:18.707 --> 15:21.041
Sorry, I just have
a few fires to put out.

15:21.043 --> 15:23.827
Well, I hope you get them
all extinguished by dinner.

15:23.829 --> 15:26.129
We still on?

15:26.131 --> 15:27.581
Of course.

15:27.583 --> 15:30.050
Um, I made reservations
for Cuban.

15:30.052 --> 15:31.385
Cuban?

15:31.387 --> 15:33.220
Cuban's perfect.

15:33.222 --> 15:35.872
I guess they didn't have
much of that in Chicago.

15:35.874 --> 15:37.891
No, but you know
business trips,

15:37.893 --> 15:39.760
you don't go
for the food.

15:39.762 --> 15:41.228
Ah, I work with dead people.

15:41.230 --> 15:44.014
I don't get many
business trips.

15:44.016 --> 15:46.099
You know, I could have
sworn that you said

15:46.101 --> 15:48.068
that your conference
was in Cincinnati.

15:48.070 --> 15:49.903
Did I?

15:49.905 --> 15:51.721
Chicago, Cincinnati,
I don't know,

15:51.723 --> 15:53.857
they all
blend together.

15:53.859 --> 15:55.158
I'm just glad

15:55.160 --> 15:56.777
that you made it through
that crazy storm.

15:56.779 --> 15:58.612
You know, in time
for the occasion.

15:58.614 --> 16:00.230
Yeah, luckily.

16:00.232 --> 16:02.999
Um, flight was a
bit rough, but...

16:03.001 --> 16:04.618
I'm glad
to be back.

16:04.620 --> 16:07.621
I'll see
you tonight.

16:28.392 --> 16:29.860
I was with Marks.

16:29.862 --> 16:31.528
What was so urgent?

16:31.530 --> 16:33.447
He's not an idiot,

16:33.449 --> 16:35.866
he notices details like me
being totally distracted.

16:35.868 --> 16:39.619
Evan's getting
closer and closer.

16:39.621 --> 16:42.205
We've got a
hotter lead.

16:42.207 --> 16:44.207
We'll brief you
on the details,

16:44.209 --> 16:46.609
but we lost the entire
team who was on it.

16:46.611 --> 16:48.111
Keller?

16:48.113 --> 16:49.779
Took them out.

16:49.781 --> 16:51.665
Every one.

16:51.667 --> 16:54.617
Someone is
protecting him.

16:56.453 --> 16:58.788
She leaked info
to a journalist.

16:58.790 --> 17:01.341
I took care of him,

17:01.343 --> 17:04.010
but I need you
to handle her.

17:04.012 --> 17:07.681
You need me to risk my cover
to take some girl out?

17:07.683 --> 17:10.650
Well, make up whatever
story you want,

17:10.652 --> 17:12.903
but you have to
gain her trust.

17:12.905 --> 17:15.105
Get to Keller.

17:15.107 --> 17:16.990
Then get rid of her.

17:23.646 --> 17:25.115
<i>Alex went to a reporter.</i>

17:25.117 --> 17:27.150
Do you know about this?
No.

17:27.152 --> 17:29.169
He turned
up dead.

17:29.171 --> 17:31.838
Staged suicide, and
his laptop is missing.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.256
Muirfield.

17:33.258 --> 17:36.459
And now I can't
find Alex anywhere.

17:36.461 --> 17:37.511
Okay, we've gotta find her.

17:37.513 --> 17:39.012
No, you cannot
leave today.

17:39.014 --> 17:41.681
We can't take any risks.
She's right.

17:41.683 --> 17:42.966
They're closer
than they've ever been.

17:42.968 --> 17:44.217
But if they're still

17:44.219 --> 17:45.635
on Alex's trail after everything

17:45.637 --> 17:47.137
that went down in the woods...

17:47.139 --> 17:49.472
how do you know they're
not on to you, too?

17:49.474 --> 17:51.174
I've been watching every move,

17:51.176 --> 17:52.526
every turn, every call.

17:52.528 --> 17:53.693
I hope I'm
not alone.

17:53.695 --> 17:55.612
I'm on it.
But I gotta jet.

17:55.614 --> 17:57.230
If Sara gets to the final leg

17:57.232 --> 17:59.399
of her V-Day scavenger hunt
and I'm not there...

17:59.401 --> 18:00.700
I'll be a dead man anyway.

18:00.702 --> 18:02.569
Listen to her.

18:02.571 --> 18:04.654
Well, for today.

18:04.656 --> 18:06.022
Um...

18:06.024 --> 18:08.909
and it might be a good idea

18:08.911 --> 18:12.579
if you curbed
your online spending.

18:12.581 --> 18:14.364
The secret admirer?

18:14.366 --> 18:15.999
Yeah, you're welcome.

18:16.001 --> 18:18.552
I...

18:18.554 --> 18:19.970
I'm sorry, I just...

18:19.972 --> 18:22.038
I needed to show you
that I'm in this.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.558
The gifts are...
they're thoughtful,

18:24.560 --> 18:27.093
but it's...

18:27.095 --> 18:29.145
But there's nothing
about two dozen roses

18:29.147 --> 18:30.764
that says, "I'm not
going to run back

18:30.766 --> 18:33.650
to the next ex
who crosses my path," huh?

18:33.652 --> 18:36.552
Yeah, JT filled me in.

18:36.554 --> 18:38.438
You're not
making this easy.

18:38.440 --> 18:41.057
I'm not... I'm not trying
to make it hard.

18:41.059 --> 18:43.743
Mm-hmm.

18:43.745 --> 18:45.745
Okay, none of that matters
right now.

18:45.747 --> 18:48.615
Alex betrayed you
and she is still out there.

18:48.617 --> 18:50.283
Yeah, in danger.
And it's my fault.

18:50.285 --> 18:51.751
So we gotta do
something about it.

18:51.753 --> 18:53.420
No, I have to do
something about it.

18:53.422 --> 18:55.956
You are going to go
and sit on that couch

18:55.958 --> 18:58.508
or do a thousand push-ups
or level up

18:58.510 --> 19:00.760
on every video game you have.
You cannot leave.

19:00.762 --> 19:01.911
I'm not gonna sit in here

19:01.913 --> 19:03.246
while you're out there
in danger.

19:03.248 --> 19:04.431
You will if you want me

19:04.433 --> 19:06.099
to trust you again.

19:29.407 --> 19:31.941
Guess he's not coming.

19:35.246 --> 19:37.130
It wasn't suicide.

19:37.132 --> 19:38.882
The people who
killed your friend,

19:38.884 --> 19:40.417
they have eyes
everywhere.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.304
I'm-I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:44.306 --> 19:45.621
Look, you're
terrified

19:45.623 --> 19:47.390
and you're a bad liar,

19:47.392 --> 19:49.009
so don't waste time
with an unconvincing bluff.

19:49.011 --> 19:51.761
I just need to know
one thing.

19:51.763 --> 19:53.930
Do you really care
about Vincent?

19:53.932 --> 19:55.765
Who are you?

19:55.767 --> 19:57.067
Someone who wants
to help him.

19:57.069 --> 19:58.968
To make him normal again.

19:58.970 --> 20:00.654
Just like you.

20:00.656 --> 20:02.939
And why should I believe
you can do that?

20:02.941 --> 20:05.975
Because you don't
have a choice.

20:05.977 --> 20:07.643
You were there in the woods.

20:07.645 --> 20:10.280
Another posse of those black ops
will keep coming.

20:10.282 --> 20:13.249
He can only hold
them off for so long.

20:13.251 --> 20:14.650
That's your fear, isn't it?

20:14.652 --> 20:16.336
That next time,
he won't be so lucky

20:16.338 --> 20:17.671
to make it out alive?

20:17.673 --> 20:19.923
How do you know so much?

20:19.925 --> 20:22.158
Because we
created him.

20:23.294 --> 20:25.628
The group I represent
feels responsible

20:25.630 --> 20:27.514
for his condition...

20:27.516 --> 20:29.332
the hell he's been through.

20:29.334 --> 20:30.550
And we want to heal him.

20:30.552 --> 20:33.019
Fix the mistakes
that we've made.

20:33.021 --> 20:34.721
You do want
that, don't you?

20:34.723 --> 20:37.190
To have the man you fell
in love with back?

20:37.192 --> 20:38.274
I don't know...

20:38.276 --> 20:41.478
Alex, his mutations...

20:41.480 --> 20:43.813
they'll only grow
more and more grotesque.

20:43.815 --> 20:45.848
It's only a
matter of time

20:45.850 --> 20:48.851
before you don't even
recognize Vincent.

20:50.073 --> 20:52.331
Unless you help us.

20:59.744 --> 21:01.728
<i>Salter. Alex Salter.</i>

21:01.828 --> 21:05.079
Were there any charges to her
credit card since yesterday?

21:06.081 --> 21:08.565
Cancelled? By who?

21:08.567 --> 21:10.001
She did?

21:10.003 --> 21:12.069
Uh... no, thanks,
that's it.

21:12.071 --> 21:13.588
Bye.

21:13.590 --> 21:15.756
Looks like big boss man
finally came through.

21:15.758 --> 21:17.408
No. These
came for you.

21:17.410 --> 21:18.793
Wait. You're eating

21:18.795 --> 21:20.094
my Valentine's chocolates?

21:20.096 --> 21:22.296
They're cream-filled.
You hate those.

21:22.298 --> 21:23.798
Looks like your
non-secret secret admirer

21:23.800 --> 21:26.083
doesn't know you too well.

21:26.085 --> 21:28.519
From Evan's report it
all looks pretty clean.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.438
The bullet angle is accurate
for a suicide.

21:30.440 --> 21:32.607
That just means that our killer
knew what they were doing.

21:32.609 --> 21:34.141
Homicide is breathing
down my neck to see if

21:34.143 --> 21:35.559
we've got a suicide or not.

21:35.561 --> 21:37.812
Well, it's still
inconclusive, boss.

21:37.814 --> 21:39.597
If it was a killer,
they got in and out without

21:39.599 --> 21:41.282
leaving any prints, and hardly
any sign of a struggle.

21:41.284 --> 21:42.533
We got a missing laptop,

21:42.535 --> 21:43.734
which could point back

21:43.736 --> 21:45.670
to a murder.
No other evidence?

21:45.672 --> 21:47.771
A cell phone. We wanted to see
if we could get prints

21:47.773 --> 21:49.273
off it before we messed with it.

21:49.275 --> 21:51.108
The lab's backed up,
so we're waiting.

21:51.110 --> 21:53.327
Let's see if we can do better
than just waiting.

Hey.

23:14.860 --> 23:17.528
Vincent, it's Alex.

23:17.530 --> 23:20.197
Look, I need your help.

23:20.199 --> 23:23.667
I'm at the Beau Monde Hotel,
room 305.

23:41.570 --> 23:42.820
That's so grocery store.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.522
Try a little
originality, buddy.

23:44.524 --> 23:46.273
Are you jealous?

23:46.275 --> 23:47.541
Totally.

23:48.578 --> 23:50.528
This is fun, though.

23:50.530 --> 23:54.565
Our annual Lonely Heart
Table for Two.

23:54.567 --> 23:56.700
Hey, hey, guys.

23:58.754 --> 24:01.088
Oh, great.

24:01.090 --> 24:02.790
Not only am I
such a loser

24:02.792 --> 24:04.908
that I go to a cop bar
on Valentine's Day,

24:04.910 --> 24:07.411
but the guy who ditched me
'cause he supposedly had a date

24:07.413 --> 24:09.597
with his wife is now here
to make it memorable.

24:09.599 --> 24:10.848
Annoying,
but memorable.

24:10.850 --> 24:13.751
Hi.
Hi.

24:13.753 --> 24:15.853
Uh, Evan's girlfriend canceled
on him,

24:15.855 --> 24:18.556
so I, uh, we figured we could
both use a beer.

24:20.725 --> 24:26.480
Yeah, well, I'm going to go
and get that elusive beer.

24:35.657 --> 24:37.792
Tess, it's...

24:37.794 --> 24:40.878
Don't.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.464
Fine.

24:45.834 --> 24:48.335
It really feels
complicated, though.

24:50.889 --> 24:53.007
I thought you'd be on a hot date

24:53.009 --> 24:54.875
with the mountain climbing,
long-legged Claire.

24:54.877 --> 24:56.877
I thought I would be, too.

24:56.879 --> 24:59.597
Oh, no. I'm sorry.
Is everything okay?

24:59.599 --> 25:01.482
I don't know.

25:01.484 --> 25:04.318
Claire told me that she was on
a business trip in Chicago,

25:04.320 --> 25:05.469
and I asked her about
the horrible storm

25:05.471 --> 25:06.854
that they had there.

25:06.856 --> 25:08.189
Only they didn't have a storm.

25:08.191 --> 25:10.140
She didn't know that.

25:10.142 --> 25:12.827
Okay, I don't know what is more
weird, the fact she didn't know

25:12.829 --> 25:15.613
about the storm or the fact
that you're testing her.

25:15.615 --> 25:18.115
Perhaps I'm paranoid.

25:18.117 --> 25:21.418
It just, every time I think
I know somebody,

25:21.420 --> 25:25.789
I just realize
that I don't know them at all.

25:25.791 --> 25:27.991
Yeah, there seems
to be a bad case

25:27.993 --> 25:30.344
of that going around lately.

25:30.346 --> 25:33.097
To our sweethearts.

25:33.099 --> 25:35.516
Easy on the sweet
and hard on the heart.

25:38.688 --> 25:42.673
Mm! Phone. Thank you.

25:44.277 --> 25:45.442
Hello?

25:45.444 --> 25:46.861
Hey, it's JT.
I'm just wondering

25:46.863 --> 25:48.312
if you've spoken to the big guy.

25:48.314 --> 25:50.898
I'm just concerned because
I just got a message from him.

25:50.900 --> 25:53.200
He said Alex needed him.

25:53.202 --> 25:55.953
Why wouldn't he tell me?

25:55.955 --> 25:58.656
I don't think there were
a lot of loopholes

25:58.658 --> 25:59.990
in your last ultimatum.

25:59.992 --> 26:01.375
Any idea where they went?

26:01.377 --> 26:02.859
That's why my alarm went off.

26:02.861 --> 26:06.863
He said he was going
to the Beau Monde Hotel.

26:16.007 --> 26:17.258
Hey.
Hi.

26:17.260 --> 26:19.226
What's going on?
Are you okay?

26:19.228 --> 26:22.062
I was so scared.
That's okay. It's okay.

26:26.351 --> 26:28.402
It's okay. It's okay.

26:28.404 --> 26:31.238
Ooh!

26:50.643 --> 26:52.711
It's okay.

26:52.713 --> 26:54.779
Shh.

26:59.386 --> 27:01.086
You need help, Vince.

27:01.088 --> 27:03.305
I know you think you can trust
Catherine, but she's...

27:03.307 --> 27:05.423
You need to get out of here
right now.

27:05.425 --> 27:06.758
Oh, no, no.

27:06.760 --> 27:08.660
It's okay, they'll protect us.

27:08.662 --> 27:12.147
Alex, come on.
Someone may have come to you

27:12.149 --> 27:14.666
and said they can help,
but do you really think

27:14.668 --> 27:18.470
I would live my life like this
if I had any option?

27:18.472 --> 27:20.372
I think you have
someone in your life

27:20.374 --> 27:22.223
who finds it convenient
to keep you trapped.

27:22.225 --> 27:24.993
So they don't have to share you.

27:24.995 --> 27:26.928
But they're not helping.

27:26.930 --> 27:28.463
You mean Catherine?

27:28.465 --> 27:30.065
She doesn't want
to see you better.

27:30.067 --> 27:33.885
No, she wants to help me.
Okay?

27:33.887 --> 27:38.473
And even if I don't change,
she accepts me for who I am,

27:38.475 --> 27:40.825
and that is why I trust her.

27:50.186 --> 27:55.056
What did you give me...

27:55.058 --> 27:56.308
etorphine hydrochloride?

27:56.310 --> 27:57.309
Are you okay?

27:57.311 --> 28:00.445
You know the dehydrating
effects, yeah?

28:00.447 --> 28:03.031
Alex, I need
something to drink.

28:03.033 --> 28:04.866
Of course.
I'll get you some water.

28:22.418 --> 28:24.219
She told me
you might come.

28:24.221 --> 28:26.221
Who?

28:26.223 --> 28:28.256
She didn't
give me a name.

28:28.258 --> 28:30.708
She gave me a little something
to protect myself

28:30.710 --> 28:32.093
until she gets here.

28:32.095 --> 28:34.062
She's on her way up right now.

28:35.314 --> 28:38.549
Take yours out slowly.

28:41.520 --> 28:44.722
Set it on the ground.

28:48.077 --> 28:49.778
Kick it over to me.

28:49.780 --> 28:52.113
Alex.

28:52.898 --> 28:54.165
Alex, come on.

28:54.167 --> 28:56.167
You got to let us go, okay?

28:56.169 --> 28:58.453
Whoever you think
I am now, it's...

28:58.455 --> 29:01.806
No. They'll make
you normal again.

29:01.808 --> 29:04.742
They are going to cut him open
and study him.

29:04.744 --> 29:07.045
No! They made him like this.

29:07.047 --> 29:09.347
They're the ones
that are going to undo it.

29:09.349 --> 29:11.349
I know you think
that you're helping,

29:11.351 --> 29:14.636
but you're just getting
in the way!

29:14.638 --> 29:17.956
Actually, it was my mother
who made him.

29:17.958 --> 29:19.257
Your mother?

29:19.259 --> 29:21.276
Yeah.

29:21.278 --> 29:24.529
She worked for them,
and they killed her for it.

29:24.531 --> 29:28.666
I know you're just trying to do
what's best, but this is not it.

29:28.668 --> 29:31.619
There may never be
a cure for me.

29:31.621 --> 29:34.289
And she'll just accept that.

29:34.291 --> 29:37.125
Just accept you the
way that you are.

29:37.127 --> 29:39.777
Alex, listen to me, okay?

29:39.779 --> 29:43.548
We lost our lives, our future

29:43.550 --> 29:46.301
because we were casualties
of Muirfield,

29:46.303 --> 29:48.303
so don't give them
anything else.

29:48.305 --> 29:49.587
Don't risk

29:49.589 --> 29:52.924
our lives now for this.

29:52.926 --> 29:56.227
Come on. Somewhere deep down
you must know

29:56.229 --> 29:57.779
that they're using you.

30:01.301 --> 30:04.769
Alex, please.

30:19.952 --> 30:21.369
Where is he?

30:21.371 --> 30:23.421
He got away. I'm so sorry.

30:23.423 --> 30:25.290
Move.

30:30.596 --> 30:33.131
I told you he escaped.
How?

30:33.133 --> 30:35.467
You gave him the tranq, right?

30:35.469 --> 30:37.001
Just like
you told me.

30:37.003 --> 30:38.803
Maybe-Maybe
it wasn't enough?

30:38.805 --> 30:41.856
Or maybe some of those
old feelings bubbled up,

30:41.858 --> 30:44.058
and he played you.

30:45.177 --> 30:48.396
Love makes you do crazy things.

30:48.398 --> 30:49.847
Please, please.

30:49.849 --> 30:51.616
If you're gonna die,

30:51.618 --> 30:53.401
it might as well be for love.

31:21.063 --> 31:22.564
Here.

31:24.266 --> 31:26.067
Thanks.

31:26.069 --> 31:31.406
Alex, I'm sorry I'm not the guy
you fell in love with.

31:31.408 --> 31:34.442
You're not a monster, Vince.

31:35.828 --> 31:39.948
And I'm so sorry about
what's been done to you.

31:39.950 --> 31:42.951
I'm sorry you have to leave
everything behind.

31:42.953 --> 31:45.870
You know what? I've been
thinking about that.

31:45.872 --> 31:47.922
Maybe it's not
such a bad thing.

31:47.924 --> 31:50.208
I mean, staying here,

31:50.210 --> 31:55.230
I was still holding onto a
life I'd lost ten years ago.

31:59.885 --> 32:02.086
Maybe now I can finally let go

32:02.088 --> 32:05.306
of a couple ghosts that have
been following me around.

32:05.308 --> 32:08.810
You know, those two ghosts were
great together once.

32:10.229 --> 32:11.762
Yeah.

32:42.978 --> 32:45.680
Okay.

32:45.682 --> 32:49.851
You're gonna have
to change buses in Des Moines

32:49.853 --> 32:51.653
and again in Wichita.

32:51.655 --> 32:54.439
Here's your ID.

32:55.507 --> 32:58.176
Thanks.

33:00.529 --> 33:02.447
After all I've done to you,

33:02.449 --> 33:04.248
I can't believe
you would go so far

33:04.250 --> 33:05.667
out of your way for me.

33:05.669 --> 33:07.752
I wish there was a way
to repay you.

33:07.754 --> 33:11.122
Just don't get yourself killed.

33:13.510 --> 33:16.427
Catherine,

33:16.429 --> 33:18.346
I took care of Vince
for a long time,

33:18.348 --> 33:19.697
and I get that's your job now,

33:19.699 --> 33:21.599
and you are good at it.

33:21.601 --> 33:24.469
Really, really good.

33:24.471 --> 33:29.107
I can see why
he trusts you so much.

33:29.109 --> 33:32.977
I think you're more sure
of that than he is.

33:32.979 --> 33:35.530
What, because my ex-fiancé
turns up for a couple weeks,

33:35.532 --> 33:36.948
pretends to rock the boat?

33:36.950 --> 33:39.517
Alex, you were his first love.

33:39.519 --> 33:42.403
Everybody has a first love.

33:44.306 --> 33:46.724
Sometimes we outgrow them.

33:48.193 --> 33:50.528
He has.

33:50.530 --> 33:52.547
Why do you say that?

33:52.549 --> 33:54.032
Because Vince

33:54.034 --> 33:56.801
always does the right thing.

33:56.803 --> 34:01.422
Like making up for leaving me.

34:01.424 --> 34:04.509
Even if his heart isn't in it.

34:04.511 --> 34:06.894
And because...

34:06.896 --> 34:10.164
I'm not the one he loves.

34:57.771 --> 34:59.989
Tess, hey, I was just, uh...

34:59.991 --> 35:01.741
Don't.

35:01.743 --> 35:04.276
I really can't handle you lying
to my face right now.

35:04.278 --> 35:08.331
Okay, there-there's a reason.

35:10.133 --> 35:11.834
Okay, well, I'm standing here,

35:11.836 --> 35:13.503
waiting to hear
the amazing reason

35:13.505 --> 35:15.788
you're destroying evidence.

35:15.790 --> 35:18.257
Are you gonna say something?

35:18.259 --> 35:19.725
Like what?

35:19.727 --> 35:21.844
I thought I saw you
ripping out a page?

35:21.846 --> 35:24.480
Of course your fingerprints
are all over the evidence

35:24.482 --> 35:26.349
from being at the crime scene.

35:26.351 --> 35:27.900
They can't prove anything.

35:27.902 --> 35:29.852
So it'd be your
word against mine.

35:29.854 --> 35:33.472
I am trying to protect somebody.

35:33.474 --> 35:35.107
Not me, obviously.

35:35.109 --> 35:36.576
If they think
I'm involved in this,

35:36.578 --> 35:38.327
we'll both get kicked
off the force.

35:38.329 --> 35:39.979
Tess, I can't tell you.

35:39.981 --> 35:42.498
For your own safety, I can't.

35:45.986 --> 35:49.255
I guess that didn't make
any difference.

35:49.257 --> 35:53.009
I'll put in for a new partner
in the morning.

35:53.011 --> 35:56.829
Just, uh, tell them
it's personal reasons.

35:56.831 --> 35:59.882
No one thought two chicks
could be a team anyway.

35:59.884 --> 36:02.468
Guess we'll prove them right.

36:30.213 --> 36:34.199
I guess you weren't about
to surprise me with a tryst.

36:34.201 --> 36:36.552
Something tells me I'm not
really surprising you at all.

36:36.554 --> 36:38.304
Who are you?

36:38.306 --> 36:40.006
Who sent you here to
contaminate my work?

36:40.008 --> 36:41.424
Contaminate?

36:41.426 --> 36:43.175
Your the only one who
had access to my morgue

36:43.177 --> 36:45.227
the night that my tissue
samples were corrupted.

36:45.229 --> 36:47.763
And I'm guessing you're not
going through my DNA files

36:47.765 --> 36:49.565
to find out what I
want for my birthday.

36:49.567 --> 36:52.518
Your cross-species research
ended up on our radar.

36:52.520 --> 36:55.771
And you were sent in
to do what exactly?

36:55.773 --> 36:58.441
Sleep with me to gain
access to my work?

36:58.443 --> 37:00.225
Just flirt.

37:00.227 --> 37:03.245
The sex part, well,
that was...

37:03.247 --> 37:05.197
Don't say you fell in love.

37:05.199 --> 37:07.283
Fair enough.
It was a perk.

37:10.837 --> 37:13.372
I take it that's the most
honest thing you've said to me.

37:13.374 --> 37:15.541
So who sent you here?

37:15.543 --> 37:17.409
The company that made him.

37:17.411 --> 37:19.211
The genetically altered species.

37:19.213 --> 37:20.379
So he didn't evolve.

37:20.381 --> 37:22.048
He was created.

37:22.050 --> 37:23.265
Amazing.

37:23.267 --> 37:24.684
Terrifying.

37:24.686 --> 37:26.102
It was a mistake.

37:26.104 --> 37:27.436
You've seen
what he's capable of.

37:27.438 --> 37:28.804
And I have a sense of what

37:28.806 --> 37:31.023
your organization
is capable of as well.

37:31.025 --> 37:33.526
I'm guessing that they don't
have non-profit status.

37:33.528 --> 37:35.811
Our tactics may seem extreme,

37:35.813 --> 37:37.763
but that's only because
what we're up against

37:37.765 --> 37:39.865
is a far greater threat.

37:39.867 --> 37:41.233
This thing is vicious.

37:41.235 --> 37:42.451
You've seen what it can do

37:42.453 --> 37:44.654
up close.

37:44.656 --> 37:46.989
We have a responsibility
to hunt it.

37:46.991 --> 37:49.408
You know there are people whose
lives will be lost if we don't.

37:49.410 --> 37:54.279
I don't want to see another life
caught in the middle.

37:54.281 --> 37:56.382
Then we're your only option.

37:56.384 --> 37:59.385
So...

37:59.387 --> 38:00.836
you'll join us.

38:00.838 --> 38:02.955
After this conversation,

38:02.957 --> 38:05.608
I get a sense
I'm either with you

38:05.610 --> 38:07.810
or I'm dead.

38:15.185 --> 38:17.136
This is Des Moines.

38:17.138 --> 38:20.106
Any passengers who need
to switch busses,

38:20.108 --> 38:22.658
please deport now.

38:54.891 --> 38:56.942
Alex is on her way out of town.

38:56.944 --> 38:59.395
Thank you for, uh,

38:59.397 --> 39:01.480
for taking care of her.

39:01.482 --> 39:04.133
Well, of, uh, everything.

39:04.135 --> 39:06.335
Of course.

39:06.337 --> 39:08.370
You know, I promised you
I wouldn't leave the loft,

39:08.372 --> 39:10.306
but Alex was in trouble.

39:10.308 --> 39:13.409
I will never be let down

39:13.411 --> 39:15.494
by you trying to help somebody.

39:15.496 --> 39:18.748
That's what I can trust.

39:18.750 --> 39:22.084
That you'll do the right thing.

39:23.703 --> 39:26.338
That's what Alex was,
wasn't she?

39:26.340 --> 39:29.458
Yeah.

39:29.460 --> 39:31.210
You know, you, uh,

39:31.212 --> 39:33.679
you really put yourself
out there today for her.

39:33.681 --> 39:37.183
And for me,

39:37.185 --> 39:40.986
especially for someone who's not
emotionally attached anymore.

39:43.407 --> 39:45.057
Yeah.

39:45.059 --> 39:46.792
Um, about that,

39:46.794 --> 39:48.561
you're not buying it, are you?

39:48.563 --> 39:50.896
Uh, no.

39:52.732 --> 39:55.234
Just...

39:55.236 --> 39:57.286
It's just, when I started
to lean on you,

39:57.288 --> 39:59.121
you weren't there.

39:59.123 --> 40:00.806
I didn't see
how I could trust

40:00.808 --> 40:02.758
whether you'd be there
or not.

40:02.760 --> 40:05.928
But turns out that I can trust

40:05.930 --> 40:09.414
that you will do
the right thing.

40:09.416 --> 40:13.352
So where does that leave us?

40:13.354 --> 40:15.688
The thing is,

40:15.690 --> 40:18.774
it turns out you can't control
your heart.

40:20.044 --> 40:21.911
Damn thing
just does what it wants.

40:21.913 --> 40:24.446
And what's yours doing now?

40:24.448 --> 40:27.783
Other than beating
a million miles a minute?

40:27.785 --> 40:29.618
I just...

40:29.620 --> 40:32.288
I think that
after the last few weeks,

40:32.290 --> 40:33.906
you know,
and all the trust issues,

40:33.908 --> 40:36.325
I think that
we should take it slow.

40:36.327 --> 40:37.576
Totally.

40:37.578 --> 40:40.746
You know,
let things unfold naturally.

40:40.748 --> 40:42.748
Right.

40:42.750 --> 40:46.502
I think I-I need
some time to...

40:47.623 --> 40:50.240
Oh, my God.

40:50.242 --> 40:52.960
What... I knew it.
