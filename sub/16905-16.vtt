WEBVTT

00:03.483 --> 00:05.588
I've finished my Kabletown self evaluation!

00:05.630 --> 00:06.963
Nailed it.

00:06.998 --> 00:09.049
"My greatest weakness
is humility.

00:09.083 --> 00:11.418
I'm probably the most humble
person in the whole world."

00:11.469 --> 00:12.469
I wrote that.

00:12.503 --> 00:14.304
These self-evaluations
are a charade.

00:14.338 --> 00:17.841
People cannot be impartial
about themselves.

00:17.875 --> 00:20.060
You should read what some
of your coworkers wrote.

00:20.094 --> 00:22.429
What three words
best describe me?

00:22.480 --> 00:25.882
The. Complete. Package.

00:25.900 --> 00:30.103
My greatest weakness...
Is chocolate.

00:30.154 --> 00:32.906
Surprisingly the only person
who was honest was Jenna.

00:32.940 --> 00:34.107
None.

00:34.158 --> 00:36.910
"I am the worst person
I know.

00:36.944 --> 00:39.029
"When I used to live with Liz,
I would videotape her sleeping

00:39.063 --> 00:40.914
and sell it to
Japanese businessmen"?

00:40.948 --> 00:44.000
No wonder that tour group kept
calling me "sleep whore-San."

00:44.035 --> 00:45.085
No, no, no, no, no.

00:45.119 --> 00:46.169
Don't read that.

00:46.203 --> 00:47.454
I filled it out last night

00:47.505 --> 00:50.907
after mixing alcohol
with prescription... exhaustion.

00:50.925 --> 00:52.175
I need to redo it.

00:52.209 --> 00:53.843
I can't believe I have
to read all of these.

00:53.878 --> 00:55.795
This is the biggest
waste of time

00:55.846 --> 00:58.181
since NBC's diversity
writing program.

00:58.215 --> 01:01.268
That was a good idea, but all
of our actors are so white.

01:01.302 --> 01:03.053
Slap it to me, Daddy-O.

01:03.087 --> 01:05.605
Popo popped dookie
down by the vacants.

30 ROCK
S06 Ep16 - Nothing left to lose

01:22.193 --> 01:25.693
sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

01:31.132 --> 01:32.632
This is Jenna.
What are you wearing?

01:32.667 --> 01:33.833
Jenna, love,

01:33.884 --> 01:36.619
it's English director
Christopher Nolan.

01:36.637 --> 01:38.672
Mr. Nolan,
I saw you across the room

01:38.723 --> 01:39.923
at the <i>Dark Knight</i> premiere.

01:39.957 --> 01:42.475
I was shooting blow darts at Maggie
Gyllenhal from a heating vent.

01:42.510 --> 01:47.347
Yes. How would you like
to be in my next movie?

01:47.398 --> 01:48.765
I quit this show!

01:48.799 --> 01:50.183
To hell with you all!

01:50.234 --> 01:51.184
Go to hell!

01:51.235 --> 01:54.354
I just need you to do a
quick camera test for me.

01:54.405 --> 01:57.857
I do not understand
Christopher Nolan's methods.

01:57.908 --> 02:00.327
He's directing a live-action
<i>Smurfs</i> sequel,

02:00.361 --> 02:02.746
so I went to Times Square,
did cartwheels like he asked...

02:02.780 --> 02:03.780
Oh, boy.

02:03.814 --> 02:05.298
We got the whole
thing on tape.

02:05.333 --> 02:06.916
This was a prank?

02:06.951 --> 02:08.484
This isn't body paint.

02:08.502 --> 02:10.753
It's a spray they use
to kill geese at airports.

02:10.788 --> 02:12.038
What happened, J-Mo?

02:12.073 --> 02:14.174
Did you pass out in
a goose costume at LaGuardia?

02:15.676 --> 02:17.660
What is
that smell, Tracy?

02:17.678 --> 02:19.379
It's the new fragrance
I designed.

02:19.413 --> 02:20.513
It's called "Desire,"

02:20.548 --> 02:22.215
but with a "Z"
instead of the second "E."

02:22.266 --> 02:23.717
What is that supposed
to smell like?

02:23.768 --> 02:25.101
All my favorite things.

02:25.136 --> 02:28.388
The Knicks, a mop from
a strip club, a carefree hobo,

02:28.439 --> 02:30.824
a crate with a new giraffe
in it, and broccoli.

02:30.858 --> 02:32.175
It smells disgusting.

02:32.193 --> 02:33.509
Yeah, I wouldn't know.

02:33.527 --> 02:35.178
I lost my sense
of smell years ago.

02:35.196 --> 02:38.347
But when one sense goes away,
the others make up for it.

02:38.366 --> 02:40.683
I have an incredible
sense of touch.

02:40.701 --> 02:44.037
I feel an old Jack-o-lantern
from last Halloween.

02:44.071 --> 02:46.189
Are you serious?

02:46.207 --> 02:47.290
You can't smell?

02:47.324 --> 02:48.792
Why haven't you
been to a doctor?

02:48.826 --> 02:50.126
Who has the time,

02:50.161 --> 02:53.413
with work, family and hobbies
and listing excuses?

02:54.832 --> 02:56.166
Oh, my.

02:56.200 --> 02:58.301
It smells like grandma's house
at Christmas.

02:58.335 --> 03:01.337
That's when we found her
dead on the toilet.

03:03.674 --> 03:05.558
Pete, I spent
the morning going over

03:05.593 --> 03:07.977
these Kabletown
self-evaluations.

03:08.012 --> 03:09.879
Your evaluation gave me pause.

03:09.897 --> 03:10.880
Are you sure?

03:10.898 --> 03:14.267
Those look like hands to me.

03:14.318 --> 03:15.268
Here's the problem.

03:15.319 --> 03:16.552
In answer to the question,

03:16.570 --> 03:17.954
"where do you see yourself
in five years?"

03:17.988 --> 03:19.739
You wrote,
"right where I am."

03:19.774 --> 03:22.225
That's an unacceptable answer.

03:22.243 --> 03:23.993
I mean, what if
the Wright brothers had said,

03:24.028 --> 03:25.862
"let's just keep
making bicycles,"

03:25.896 --> 03:28.198
or Alexander windowblinds
had said,

03:28.232 --> 03:30.566
"no, I don't want
to partially see outside"?

03:30.584 --> 03:31.951
Yeah, no, I get
what you're saying,

03:32.002 --> 03:33.970
but I'm Pete Hornberger.

03:34.004 --> 03:35.839
The last time I tried to put
myself out there,

03:35.873 --> 03:37.674
the girl turned out
to be a cop.

03:37.708 --> 03:39.709
Do you understand how this
attitude reflects on me?

03:39.743 --> 03:41.428
I am also required
to complete

03:41.462 --> 03:43.630
one of these inane
self-evaluations.

03:43.681 --> 03:44.631
It's a farce.

03:44.682 --> 03:46.082
What?
Like <i>Frasier?</i>

03:46.100 --> 03:48.017
But that's fun...

03:48.052 --> 03:49.602
But I can't say
I'm succeeding as a manager

03:49.637 --> 03:51.921
if you're failing
as an employee.

03:51.939 --> 03:53.473
You have no ambition,
Pete.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.141
No, no,
you don't understand.

03:55.192 --> 03:58.027
For me, that five years
thing is very ambitious.

03:58.062 --> 03:59.529
Look at my life, Jack.

03:59.563 --> 04:00.613
My father was a congressman.

04:00.648 --> 04:02.532
I was valedictorian
at St. Andrew's,

04:02.566 --> 04:05.268
an olympic archer,
fourth guitarist in Loverboy...

04:05.286 --> 04:06.319
As a <i>teenager.</i>

04:06.370 --> 04:07.370
It's almost unbelievable.

04:07.404 --> 04:08.488
If it weren't all true,

04:08.539 --> 04:09.656
I'd say it doesn't
even make sense.

04:09.707 --> 04:11.124
But now look at me.

04:11.158 --> 04:13.209
The last two decades
have been a freefall.

04:13.244 --> 04:16.245
If I could stay in the same
place for the next five years,

04:16.279 --> 04:17.664
that would be
a huge accomplishment.

04:17.714 --> 04:19.466
Do you know who you remind me of?

04:19.468 --> 04:20.274
George W. Bush,

04:20.276 --> 04:23.503
during his "let's do coke and
buy the Texas rangers" phase.

04:23.554 --> 04:26.723
But he made a decision
to be the best president ever

04:26.757 --> 04:29.292
and then he was.

04:29.310 --> 04:31.344
You've lost your mojo, Pete.

04:31.395 --> 04:34.514
And I'm going
to get it back for you.

04:34.565 --> 04:38.968
Well, something is definitely
obstructing your sinus cavity.

04:38.986 --> 04:40.353
Now we have two options.

04:40.404 --> 04:42.638
I can either drill a hole in the back
of your head,

04:42.656 --> 04:44.324
and push it out
with your brain...

04:44.358 --> 04:46.025
Okay, that sounds good.

04:46.060 --> 04:48.244
Or I could just pull it out
through your nostril.

04:48.279 --> 04:49.812
We'll do the second one.
Thank you.

04:49.830 --> 04:52.165
You know, they don't tell you
this until after you've paid

04:52.199 --> 04:54.334
for medical school,
but being a doctor

04:54.368 --> 04:56.753
is exactly like
the game "Operation."

04:56.787 --> 04:58.588
And there we go.

04:58.622 --> 05:01.007
My buck Rogers decoder ring!

05:01.041 --> 05:02.258
How long has
that been in there?

05:02.293 --> 05:03.510
Those things
are from the '70s.

05:03.544 --> 05:05.295
Yeah, you know what else
is from the '70s?

05:05.329 --> 05:06.346
Women staying quiet.

05:06.380 --> 05:07.830
I totally remember this.

05:07.848 --> 05:10.600
When I was nine, I found it
on the floor of the "G" train.

05:10.634 --> 05:13.386
I knew if my Foster mom saw it,
she would make me sell it

05:13.437 --> 05:15.722
at a pawn shop
to get our family a cheerio.

05:15.773 --> 05:17.140
Okay, sometimes
I think the stories

05:17.174 --> 05:19.359
of your childhood poverty
are exaggerated, but continue.

05:19.393 --> 05:20.777
So I hid the ring
up my nose.

05:20.811 --> 05:22.061
I must have forgot about it.

05:22.112 --> 05:23.646
You may feel some
burning and tingling,

05:23.680 --> 05:27.450
but you should regain normal
sensation in just a few hours.

05:27.484 --> 05:30.119
I'm sorry, I was talking
to my lover on my Bluetooth.

05:30.154 --> 05:31.571
One moment, suki.

05:31.622 --> 05:33.239
Anyway, Tracy,
you should start

05:33.290 --> 05:34.707
regaining sensation
in less than an hour.

05:34.742 --> 05:38.545
But a newly regained sense
can be a very powerful thing.

05:38.579 --> 05:40.463
Even overwhelming.

05:40.497 --> 05:42.865
So if you do have
an extreme reaction,

05:42.883 --> 05:48.388
please try to get it on video
for my nephew's funny website.

05:48.422 --> 05:51.140
Liz, are you getting
enough vitamin "C"?

05:53.010 --> 05:58.097
May I suggest messily eating
an orange while I photograph it?

05:59.767 --> 06:02.718
Kenneth, what do you
know about revenge?

06:02.736 --> 06:04.487
Well, the Bible
says it's wrong,

06:04.521 --> 06:06.889
but it's the surprise hit
of the season on ABC,

06:06.907 --> 06:08.107
so I don't know.

06:08.158 --> 06:10.660
Anyway, I know how busy
you are,

06:10.694 --> 06:13.580
so I got you some more
tattoo concealer.

06:13.614 --> 06:15.081
Thank you.

06:15.115 --> 06:17.834
I just ran out.

06:17.868 --> 06:20.003
I was so young
when I got this.

06:20.037 --> 06:22.005
Who even remembers 2007?

06:22.039 --> 06:25.625
Wait, how did you know
I was out of concealer?

06:25.676 --> 06:28.461
From your trash,
Mrs. Maroney.

06:28.512 --> 06:30.630
The garbage man knows all.

06:30.681 --> 06:34.133
In this big trash bag,
I see everyone's mistakes,

06:34.184 --> 06:36.035
their embarrassing secrets,

06:36.070 --> 06:39.255
their dreams they don't
dare share with anyone.

06:41.525 --> 06:42.942
Like this.

06:42.977 --> 06:44.944
Interesting.

06:44.979 --> 06:46.562
Kenneth, you don't
happen to have

06:46.596 --> 06:48.448
the other writers' trash
in there, do you?

06:48.482 --> 06:49.582
No.

06:49.617 --> 06:51.534
I can't handle
that much volume.

06:52.653 --> 06:53.653
I'm kidding.

06:53.704 --> 06:55.555
They call me "the natural."

06:55.589 --> 06:56.939
I'm so good,
the other janitors

06:56.957 --> 06:58.574
just sit in the basement
all day

06:58.608 --> 07:01.260
getting drunk and laughing about
this idiot they know.

07:01.295 --> 07:03.329
No.

07:03.380 --> 07:05.798
Kenneth, this concealer
is the wrong color.

07:05.833 --> 07:07.533
No.

07:07.568 --> 07:08.835
I'll be right back.

07:08.886 --> 07:10.003
Keep an eye on my trash cart?

07:10.054 --> 07:12.338
I'll keep an eye on it.

07:16.560 --> 07:19.412
Look at us,
laughing together,

07:19.446 --> 07:21.797
like a couple of Jews watching
<i>The Daily Show.</i>

07:30.574 --> 07:35.144
This is the gym of
the New York racquet club, Pete.

07:35.162 --> 07:38.114
Theodore Roosevelt
was a member here.

07:38.148 --> 07:39.648
In fact,
many of the animal heads

07:39.667 --> 07:41.918
mounted downstairs
were shot by T.R.

07:41.952 --> 07:43.920
Including the one that looked
like a terrified Asian man?

07:43.954 --> 07:45.972
It was a different time,
Pete.

07:46.006 --> 07:48.174
Today, the most powerful
men in New York

07:48.208 --> 07:49.876
still come here to exercise.

07:49.927 --> 07:53.546
And nothing is a better workout
for body and soul than boxing.

07:53.597 --> 07:55.615
It's the first sport
man ever invented.

07:55.649 --> 07:57.517
Except of course,
uh, hide and seek.

07:57.551 --> 07:59.052
Shh.

07:59.103 --> 08:00.053
Yeah.

08:00.087 --> 08:05.608
Boxing is primal, Pete.

08:05.642 --> 08:06.675
It's exactly what you need.

08:06.694 --> 08:07.860
So come on,
don't just stand there.

08:07.895 --> 08:10.179
Throw a punch,
feel like a man.

08:10.197 --> 08:12.315
A man who, years ago,
was on top of the world,

08:12.349 --> 08:14.683
who saw Paula and dragged her
back to his cave.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.185
Actually she took
me that first night.

08:16.203 --> 08:17.186
Hit something.

08:17.221 --> 08:18.871
Put your frustration
into your fists

08:18.906 --> 08:20.573
and hit something!

08:20.607 --> 08:22.825
Hornberger!

08:25.412 --> 08:26.412
Get up, Pete.

08:26.463 --> 08:27.797
Get up and fight.

08:27.831 --> 08:30.533
For God's sake, Hornberger,
the dummy is winning!

08:30.551 --> 08:32.552
Why are you kissing it?

08:32.586 --> 08:34.220
I'm submitting
to its strength.

08:34.254 --> 08:37.256
It's the Alpha.

08:39.510 --> 08:41.928
Good morning, fresh coffee.

08:41.979 --> 08:43.145
Good morning, clean floor.

08:43.179 --> 08:44.313
Funny, Kenneth.

08:44.348 --> 08:45.732
You don't have any smell
at all.

08:45.766 --> 08:47.049
Don't worry about it.

08:47.067 --> 08:51.220
♪ Perfume and roses
and strong halitosis ♪

08:51.238 --> 08:54.557
♪ Powders and flowers
and spicy clam chowders ♪

08:54.575 --> 08:57.577
♪ I can smell,
I can smell, I can smell ♪

08:57.611 --> 08:58.578
♪ I can smell ♪

08:58.612 --> 09:00.696
♪ I can... ♪

09:00.730 --> 09:02.731
Daddy?

09:06.940 --> 09:08.724
- Nice save.
- No.

09:09.428 --> 09:11.546
Vengeance announcement.

09:11.597 --> 09:13.431
Look what I found
in the trash.

09:13.466 --> 09:16.551
An email confirmation
in Frank's name for one ticket

09:16.602 --> 09:19.104
to see Taylor Swift
at Nassau Coliseum.

09:20.940 --> 09:22.690
She writes the songs
herself.

09:22.725 --> 09:24.559
When she can't cry any more,
she writes!

09:24.610 --> 09:27.011
What are you
laughing at, Toofer?

09:27.046 --> 09:31.032
You're the man who took
professional boudoir photographs

09:31.066 --> 09:33.184
and then tried to mail them
to <i>Parade</i> magazine columnist

09:33.202 --> 09:34.519
Marilyn Vos Savant.

09:36.655 --> 09:38.456
I happen to think
that smart is sexy.

09:38.491 --> 09:40.858
Our foreplay would
be puzzle-solving.

09:40.876 --> 09:42.460
Lutz's turn.

09:42.495 --> 09:44.028
What is this gonna be?

09:44.046 --> 09:45.696
No. I don't
have anything for you.

09:45.714 --> 09:46.697
You don't matter.

09:46.715 --> 09:47.749
But if you two dirtbags

09:47.800 --> 09:49.050
ever mess with me again,

09:49.084 --> 09:50.301
I'll take this
to the next level.

09:50.336 --> 09:53.204
You don't do 22 episodes
of "Celebrity outhouse"

09:53.222 --> 09:57.725
with Lorena Bobbitt without
learning a few things.

09:57.760 --> 10:00.211
You're at rehearsal
before me?

10:00.229 --> 10:01.846
Of course I am, Liz-dad.

10:01.880 --> 10:04.315
I'm your good boy.

10:04.350 --> 10:06.351
I memorized all my lines,
so can I go

10:06.385 --> 10:07.652
get dressed
for the photo shoot now,

10:07.686 --> 10:08.886
so you don't
have to wait for me?

10:08.904 --> 10:12.607
Sure, little buddy.

10:12.658 --> 10:14.826
You know,
smell is the sense

10:14.860 --> 10:16.661
most closely associated
with memory.

10:16.695 --> 10:18.780
I know, Dotcom, that's why
whenever I smell that jacket,

10:18.831 --> 10:20.415
I remember being bored.

10:20.449 --> 10:21.666
The only person
you're insulting

10:21.700 --> 10:22.917
with that attitude
is yourself.

10:22.952 --> 10:25.036
Obviously something
about the way I smell

10:25.070 --> 10:26.671
reminds Tracy of his dad.

10:26.705 --> 10:28.289
Well, his father did
work for a soup factory

10:28.340 --> 10:29.791
and you are constantly eating.

10:29.842 --> 10:30.925
It's not a food thing,
grizz.

10:30.960 --> 10:33.795
I think it's my hair pomade.

10:33.846 --> 10:34.796
Midnight symphony?

10:34.847 --> 10:36.431
My grandfather used that.

10:36.465 --> 10:38.299
Midnight symphony.

10:38.350 --> 10:43.021
You are the conductor of your
own proud African orchestra.

10:43.055 --> 10:46.474
Midnight symphony.

10:46.525 --> 10:49.644
- You use midnight symphony?
- It works, Dotcom.

10:49.695 --> 10:52.447
It was discontinued a few years
ago, but I bought seven cases

10:52.481 --> 10:54.282
of it on eBay
from a guy named Reggie.

10:54.316 --> 10:55.567
You're still here.

10:55.601 --> 10:57.101
You didn't go
to the store for milk

10:57.119 --> 10:58.786
and heroin and
then never come back.

10:58.821 --> 11:00.038
That was his excuse?

11:00.072 --> 11:01.372
You stayed because
you love me.

11:01.407 --> 11:02.373
Right, daddy-Liz?

11:02.408 --> 11:05.210
I do love you... champ.

11:05.244 --> 11:08.129
- But I could love you more.
- Well, you just wait.

11:08.163 --> 11:11.082
Watch this.

11:11.116 --> 11:12.717
Be careful, Liz.

11:12.751 --> 11:14.502
Be very careful.

11:14.537 --> 11:17.305
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Dotcom.

11:18.790 --> 11:20.308
Pete.

11:20.342 --> 11:21.876
Confidence is a spectrum.

11:21.911 --> 11:25.597
On one end,
the ultra-confident end,

11:25.631 --> 11:28.449
you have people like
Jack Donaghy, Vladimir Putin,

11:28.484 --> 11:29.567
Orville Redenbacher.

11:29.602 --> 11:31.986
Corn is not
the only thing he popped,

11:32.021 --> 11:33.571
if you know what I mean.

11:33.606 --> 11:34.856
Then...

11:34.907 --> 11:36.858
You have the other
end of the spectrum.

11:36.909 --> 11:38.243
Yeah, I get it.

11:38.277 --> 11:40.528
Men with no confidence.

11:40.563 --> 11:42.830
No, men who have
nothing left to lose.

11:42.865 --> 11:46.034
Great men like Richard Nixon,
the 1980 olympic hockey team,

11:46.085 --> 11:48.920
my good friend John Rambo.

11:48.954 --> 11:50.505
This is you.

11:50.539 --> 11:52.990
And I shouldn't have
been trying to get you

11:53.008 --> 11:54.125
all the way to the tiger,

11:54.159 --> 11:57.178
because all you needed
was a little push

11:57.212 --> 11:59.264
to get you to
nothing left to lose.

11:59.298 --> 12:02.216
This is how you get
your mojo back, Pete.

12:02.268 --> 12:03.718
No, I am there, Jack.

12:03.752 --> 12:06.104
My job is killing me,
my family resents me,

12:06.138 --> 12:07.805
the other day I was mugged
by what I'm pretty sure

12:07.839 --> 12:09.190
was two five-year-olds
in a trench coat.

12:09.224 --> 12:12.477
I already have nothing
left to lose.

12:12.511 --> 12:15.063
No, you have
one more thing.

12:15.097 --> 12:17.365
No. Not the ring.

12:17.399 --> 12:19.233
You're clinging to something
that's gone, Pete,

12:19.285 --> 12:20.985
and it's not coming back.

12:21.019 --> 12:23.187
Allow yourself to be reborn.

12:23.205 --> 12:26.374
Your life is tied
to the fate of the ring.

12:26.408 --> 12:27.592
It must be destroyed.

12:27.626 --> 12:29.494
Are you quoting
<i>Lord of the rings?</i>

12:29.528 --> 12:32.230
No, I'm quoting myself
talking to Bruce Willis.

12:36.368 --> 12:37.835
Well, well, well.

12:37.870 --> 12:39.804
If it isn't tweedle-Dee
and tweedle-black.

12:39.838 --> 12:42.223
We need to talk
about what you did.

12:42.257 --> 12:43.424
Well, you know
what they say, boys.

12:43.475 --> 12:44.592
If you can't stand the heat,

12:44.643 --> 12:45.876
get off of Mickey Rourke's
sex grill.

12:45.894 --> 12:48.246
No, this isn't about us.
It's Lutz.

12:48.280 --> 12:50.148
- I didn't do anything to Lutz.
- That's the problem.

12:50.182 --> 12:52.066
He has a thing about
being left out of stuff.

12:52.101 --> 12:53.601
The man has
self-esteem issues.

12:53.652 --> 12:54.602
I don't know why.

12:54.637 --> 12:56.154
Well, he is estranged
from his son

12:56.188 --> 12:57.755
Kellan Lutz from <i>Twilight.</i>

12:57.790 --> 13:01.109
I'm sorry, are you asking me
to apologize to him?

13:01.160 --> 13:02.577
Look, yeah,
we mess with people,

13:02.611 --> 13:04.929
but there's a line
we don't cross.

13:04.964 --> 13:07.231
For example, after you went
through our trash,

13:07.249 --> 13:08.750
we went through yours.

13:08.784 --> 13:10.168
And we found this.

13:10.202 --> 13:11.419
My self-evaluation!

13:11.453 --> 13:13.738
I want to be famous to make
people love me

13:13.756 --> 13:15.256
because I hate myself.

13:15.290 --> 13:17.258
The Jenna I talk to
at night in the mirror

13:17.292 --> 13:19.627
thinks I should kill myself.

13:19.678 --> 13:23.548
Also, I caused that
Italian cruise ship to crash.

13:23.582 --> 13:26.601
We could do a lot
of damage with this.

13:26.635 --> 13:29.354
But we're not going to.

13:29.388 --> 13:34.359
Whatever.

13:36.261 --> 13:37.862
How's my boy?

13:37.896 --> 13:38.863
Working hard?

13:38.897 --> 13:40.698
So hard, papa Lemon.

13:40.733 --> 13:43.401
You're not gonna wanna run away
and start a new family in Ohio

13:43.435 --> 13:45.803
and have a daughter
you also name Tracy.

13:45.838 --> 13:47.321
Not if you're good.

13:47.373 --> 13:49.073
I've been thinking of some
new characters for the show.

13:50.108 --> 13:51.376
This is my Jimmy Fallen
impression.

13:51.410 --> 13:53.361
Awesome, awesome, I love it!
It's my favorite!

13:53.395 --> 13:58.299
Tracy,
that's great.

13:58.333 --> 14:00.001
Tracy, what's all this stuff?

14:00.052 --> 14:02.420
Just some stuff I needed
from home, like my bed.

14:02.454 --> 14:04.338
It's a California Kong,
which is two

14:04.373 --> 14:06.674
California kings tied together
with gorilla leather.

14:06.725 --> 14:08.476
- Wait, you're living here?
- I have to.

14:08.510 --> 14:11.345
Turns out Angie's cooking
smells very ethnic,

14:11.397 --> 14:13.264
and I definitely can't
be around my family.

14:13.298 --> 14:16.601
I didn't expect this, but
teenage boys don't smell good.

14:16.635 --> 14:17.819
Wait, you can't
be around your kids?

14:17.853 --> 14:19.070
What about baby Virginia?

14:19.104 --> 14:20.822
Do you know what she does
in her underwear?

14:20.856 --> 14:22.607
Something I once did
at the oscars

14:22.641 --> 14:24.992
that caused Daryl Hannah
to throw up on me.

14:25.027 --> 14:26.944
Tracy, you can't just
abandon your family.

14:26.978 --> 14:30.248
I've got all the family I need
right here, L.L.

14:30.282 --> 14:32.834
Now back to work.

14:32.868 --> 14:37.622
Philadelphia, 1776.

14:37.656 --> 14:41.209
"John Adams and
Mitt Romney enter."

14:41.260 --> 14:44.495
Commentary!

14:51.283 --> 14:53.135
So stupid, Lutz.

14:53.289 --> 14:54.822
Disgusting.

14:54.841 --> 14:57.259
Why don't you learn your lesson
and stop trying?

14:57.293 --> 15:00.462
That girl at Starbucks smiles
at everybody, Lutz.

15:00.496 --> 15:01.596
Everybody!

15:01.631 --> 15:02.931
She doesn't want
you to kiss her.

15:02.965 --> 15:05.600
No wonder people don't include
you in things.

15:05.635 --> 15:07.903
No wonder Kellan never wants
to see you again.

15:07.937 --> 15:10.605
You're worthless.

15:13.759 --> 15:15.610
Kenneth, be honest.

15:15.645 --> 15:17.362
Am I the worst person
you know?

15:17.396 --> 15:21.233
Ms. Maroney, judging
is for God and his angels.

15:21.284 --> 15:22.951
So, yes, you are.

15:22.985 --> 15:25.704
Where's the writers' trash?

15:25.738 --> 15:26.854
I've already
taken it down

15:26.873 --> 15:28.690
to the sub-basement
compacter room.

15:28.708 --> 15:30.992
The writers had me clean out
their refrigerator today,

15:31.026 --> 15:35.196
so the trash smelled like, to
use a technical janitorial term,

15:35.214 --> 15:38.416
total ass.

15:38.467 --> 15:43.038
Kellan, why?

15:43.072 --> 15:44.222
Okay, I know
the answer to this,

15:44.257 --> 15:45.457
but I just need to hear it.

15:45.491 --> 15:47.676
If I have to choose
between work productivity

15:47.710 --> 15:49.427
and what's best
for one of my employees,

15:49.478 --> 15:51.096
I choose work, right?

15:51.147 --> 15:52.714
Great. Thank you.

15:52.732 --> 15:54.316
Something about my shoes.

15:54.350 --> 15:56.484
- Good meeting.
- Which employee?

15:56.519 --> 15:59.053
What does it matter?

15:59.071 --> 16:02.157
It's Tracy and he has never been
more productive.

16:02.191 --> 16:03.158
But he abandoned his family

16:03.192 --> 16:04.892
and his baby daughter
to do it.

16:04.911 --> 16:06.444
Lemon, I invented
business mumbling.

16:06.495 --> 16:08.497
You white garbage
bag full of pudding.

16:08.498 --> 16:08.997
What?

16:09.031 --> 16:10.682
Look, when you're
a supervisor, your job

16:10.716 --> 16:13.084
is to squeeze everything you can
out of your employees,

16:13.119 --> 16:15.587
but there's a line
and you've crossed it.

16:15.621 --> 16:16.705
Since when do you
care about any line

16:16.739 --> 16:18.206
other than the bottom line?

16:18.240 --> 16:19.791
Sorkinesque Repartee.

16:19.842 --> 16:21.293
Because I'm doing it too.

16:21.344 --> 16:23.595
I'm taking advantage of Pete

16:23.629 --> 16:25.130
like you're
taking advantage of Tracy.

16:25.164 --> 16:27.716
I said I'd fill out
my self-evaluation

16:27.750 --> 16:28.934
after I'd fixed Pete.

16:28.968 --> 16:30.302
A task I knew deep down

16:30.353 --> 16:32.887
- could never be accomplished.
- Yeah, he's a mess.

16:32.921 --> 16:34.022
But Pete's just an excuse.

16:34.056 --> 16:35.523
The fact is I can't
fill this out

16:35.558 --> 16:37.442
because there's a question
I don't know how to answer.

16:37.476 --> 16:39.644
"Where do you see
yourself in five years?"

16:39.695 --> 16:41.563
For the first time in my career,
I don't know.

16:41.597 --> 16:43.148
I could wind up anywhere.

16:43.199 --> 16:45.383
Running this company,
making couches,

16:45.418 --> 16:47.819
serving as mayor of New York.

16:47.870 --> 16:50.405
Or I could be <i>6 feet under</i>...

16:50.439 --> 16:53.291
In the subterranean paradise
we built to escape the poor.

16:53.326 --> 16:54.459
Yeah, I get it.

16:54.493 --> 16:57.445
As a writer,
that uncertainty is the fate

16:57.463 --> 16:59.831
that always I am
to face being.

16:59.882 --> 17:02.300
Well, I'm not used to it.

17:02.335 --> 17:04.386
But that's not Pete's problem,
it's mine.

17:04.420 --> 17:05.971
You go talk to Tracy

17:06.005 --> 17:08.256
and I have to stop Pete
from shaving his head.

17:08.290 --> 17:11.009
God.

17:11.060 --> 17:13.395
So, Lutz.

17:13.429 --> 17:14.813
You thought I left you off
the hook the other day?

17:14.847 --> 17:16.130
Well, you wish.

17:16.147 --> 17:17.598
I spent the whole night
going through the garbage

17:17.633 --> 17:19.984
trying to find the perfect thing
to humiliate you.

17:20.019 --> 17:21.102
Yeah, we know.

17:21.136 --> 17:22.520
We took photos of you

17:22.555 --> 17:25.073
and sold them
to a garbage fetish website.

17:27.526 --> 17:29.110
This was all a prank?

17:29.144 --> 17:30.445
I knew the mirror thing
would get her.

17:30.479 --> 17:32.330
I'm so sad.

17:32.365 --> 17:34.082
I never talk to my son,
Kellan.

17:34.116 --> 17:35.283
It's all made up, Jenna.

17:35.318 --> 17:37.202
Kellan Lutz isn't my son.

17:37.253 --> 17:39.537
He's my grandnephew
and we're very close.

17:39.572 --> 17:41.456
Unbelievable.

17:41.490 --> 17:44.158
I was actually doing something
nice for Lutz and...

17:44.176 --> 17:45.993
My God.

17:46.012 --> 17:48.329
I was doing something nice.

17:48.347 --> 17:50.932
You took advantage
of my niceness.

17:50.966 --> 17:52.050
Why are you smiling?

17:52.101 --> 17:54.219
You spent the night
in our garbage.

17:54.270 --> 17:55.854
We win!

17:55.888 --> 17:57.355
No, I win.

17:57.390 --> 18:00.675
On my self-evaluation, I said
I'm the worst person I know.

18:00.693 --> 18:02.277
But it's not true!

18:02.311 --> 18:05.113
Thanks to you guys,
I'm the fourth worst.

18:05.147 --> 18:09.183
♪ Jenna's amazing
like a star in the sky ♪

18:09.201 --> 18:12.203
♪ Jenna's amazing like
a star in the sky ♪

18:12.238 --> 18:14.472
Pete, I apologize.

18:14.507 --> 18:16.508
I never should have
told you how to live your life

18:16.542 --> 18:18.710
like some sort of American
Barack Obama.

18:18.744 --> 18:19.711
Commentary.

18:19.745 --> 18:20.962
The truth of the matter is

18:20.996 --> 18:23.331
this whole thing
wasn't even about you.

18:23.365 --> 18:25.300
It was about me.

18:25.334 --> 18:27.402
Really? 'Cause it seems
like it was about me, Jack.

18:27.436 --> 18:29.421
Do you know what
was under my hair?

18:29.455 --> 18:34.059
A birthmark.

18:34.093 --> 18:35.510
Good God.

18:35.544 --> 18:37.879
It looks like a swastika
made out of penises.

18:37.897 --> 18:39.314
I know what it looks like!

18:39.348 --> 18:43.184
Since you've been "helping" me,
my life has gotten worse.

18:43.218 --> 18:46.604
I broke my nose, a gay rabbi
chased me through midtown,

18:46.639 --> 18:49.574
and last night, Paula wouldn't
touch me looking like this.

18:49.608 --> 18:51.776
Do you know what it's like
to try to have sex

18:51.827 --> 18:54.162
wearing a child's
little orphan Annie wig?

18:54.196 --> 18:55.530
- No.
- You know what?

18:55.564 --> 18:56.531
You've done enough.

18:56.565 --> 18:58.433
Get the hell out of my office.

18:58.467 --> 19:01.619
Congratulations, I knew
I'd make a man out of you.

19:01.654 --> 19:03.088
Get out!

19:03.122 --> 19:04.789
There's the confidence.

19:04.840 --> 19:10.095
Please, just leave.

19:10.129 --> 19:12.914
Pete, you're welcome.

19:19.522 --> 19:24.058
You wanted to see me, smell?

19:24.092 --> 19:27.479
Sit down, champ.

19:28.564 --> 19:30.315
Why are you so heavy?

19:30.366 --> 19:32.200
'Cause so much of me
has died.

19:32.234 --> 19:36.270
Okay.

19:36.288 --> 19:38.656
Tracy, I'm so proud of you.

19:38.707 --> 19:41.826
You have grown into
such a wonderful person

19:41.877 --> 19:44.162
for these last 24 hours.

19:44.213 --> 19:47.499
But when you're a father
or even a father smell,

19:47.550 --> 19:49.951
sometimes you have
to make sacrifices

19:49.969 --> 19:51.920
to do what's right
for your family.

19:51.954 --> 19:54.889
I just wanna make you
proud of me, L. L.-Dad-Liz-dad.

19:54.924 --> 19:56.474
I know.

19:56.509 --> 19:59.477
But there's only one thing you
need to do to make me proud.

19:59.512 --> 20:02.647
Pop dookie down
by the vacants?

20:02.681 --> 20:05.683
Boy, if I had a dollar
for every time I've been asked

20:05.734 --> 20:07.468
to reverse
one of my procedures,

20:07.486 --> 20:10.438
my bitch ex-wife
would be a millionaire.

20:10.472 --> 20:12.073
May she rest in peace.

20:12.107 --> 20:13.908
- All right.
- Wait, Dr. Spaceman.

20:13.943 --> 20:15.944
There's so much
I haven't smelled yet.

20:15.978 --> 20:17.362
A magnolia tree in spring,

20:17.413 --> 20:20.165
the towels at
a miss Hawaiian tropic contest,

20:20.199 --> 20:21.583
the sweat
of a terrified Webster

20:21.617 --> 20:23.701
as you load him
into a Cannon.

20:23.752 --> 20:25.870
Tracy, you have to do this.

20:25.921 --> 20:27.422
Now, full disclosure,

20:27.456 --> 20:30.341
I lost your ring
at a Bodeans concert,

20:30.376 --> 20:31.459
so I'm gonna shove this

20:31.493 --> 20:33.628
hilarious pencil-topper
up there.

20:33.662 --> 20:36.381
Get a haircut, or I'm gonna
shove you up a black guy's nose.

20:36.432 --> 20:37.432
Very well.

20:37.466 --> 20:39.517
You leave me no choice then.

20:39.552 --> 20:41.469
Goodbye, helpful Tracy.

20:41.503 --> 20:44.272
Goodbye... daddy-head.

20:44.306 --> 20:46.524
Goodbye only evidence
tying me

20:46.559 --> 20:48.276
to my ex-wife's disappearance.

20:53.871 --> 20:55.055
Five years from now?

20:55.089 --> 20:56.723
Well, I'd like
to still be working for NBC,

20:56.757 --> 20:59.359
or whatever NBC
is in five years.

20:59.410 --> 21:01.394
A T-shirt company probably?

21:01.951 --> 21:04.502
My greatest strength is that
I'm a good listener.

21:04.520 --> 21:07.522
Watch.

21:11.827 --> 21:13.428
In five years,
I hope I don't have to do

21:13.462 --> 21:14.763
this hat thing any more.

21:14.797 --> 21:16.781
In five years,
I'll probably be dead

21:16.816 --> 21:18.816
and no one will even notice,
and yes,

21:19.233 --> 21:22.733
this is my second attempt
to writing my self evaluation.
