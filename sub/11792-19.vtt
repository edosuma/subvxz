WEBVTT

00:00.607 --> 00:01.274
Previously on "nip/tuck"...

00:02.341 --> 00:04.309
I'm getting married
again. He lives in England.

00:04.377 --> 00:05.177
But what about our kids?

00:05.244 --> 00:06.478
I want them to come with me.

00:06.546 --> 00:08.947
I'm pregnant. It's Sean's sperm.

00:09.015 --> 00:10.515
You're gonna raise another child?

00:10.583 --> 00:16.455
I have no legal rights, and I am fine
with that. I want what's best for my son.

00:12.518 --> 00:13.718
Leishmaniasis.

00:13.786 --> 00:14.686
Why bring him to us?

00:16.522 --> 00:18.990
You've got a shot at the
real thing with Ramona.

00:19.058 --> 00:20.892
Ava's just gonna toss you aside

00:20.960 --> 00:26.698
the second she's done with you.

00:26.766 --> 00:28.066
He's late.

00:28.134 --> 00:29.668
What else is new?

00:29.735 --> 00:30.969
I swear, if he comes through

00:31.037 --> 00:32.337
that door with that bitch, I'm

00:32.405 --> 00:35.807
gonna throw them both off the balcony.

00:35.875 --> 00:38.276
Well, if it isn't our
very own Benjamin Braddock.

00:38.344 --> 00:39.744
Do we really need to start

00:39.812 --> 00:41.813
right in with all the
jerk-off comments, Christian?

00:41.881 --> 00:42.647
You bet your ass you do.

00:42.715 --> 00:44.182
We're the ones who had to fight

00:44.250 --> 00:45.484
off Ramona's family to stop them

00:45.551 --> 00:46.852
hunting you down and treating

00:46.919 --> 00:49.321
you like a pinata. It was
like the Alamo in there.

00:49.388 --> 00:51.256
Yeah. They were pretty pissed, huh?

00:51.324 --> 00:52.491
You left her at the altar.

00:52.558 --> 00:54.359
Humiliated her. All of them.

00:54.427 --> 00:57.195
Yeah, I know, I know. And I'm
gonna clear that up as soon as

00:57.263 --> 01:00.966
things settle down and
we get back from Brazil.

01:01.033 --> 01:05.170
Well, Ava found a doctor in Rio
who's willing to do Rafael's surgery.

01:05.238 --> 01:07.806
And what about Jenna? You planning
on taking your daughter with you?

01:07.874 --> 01:11.810
No. And that's actually why
I came by. I wanted to ask you

01:11.878 --> 01:14.379
guys if she could stay with you
for a couple of weeks. I'm gonna

01:14.447 --> 01:17.015
be spending all my time
taking care of Rafael and Ava.

01:17.083 --> 01:18.083
Are you sure you didn't drop

01:18.151 --> 01:19.551
him on his head when he was a baby?

01:19.619 --> 01:21.186
You're not thinking clearly, Matt.

01:21.254 --> 01:23.655
I've never had less doubt
about anything in my life. I

01:23.723 --> 01:27.692
- love her. I've always loved her.
- She doesn't love you.

01:27.760 --> 01:32.330
You know, stop trying to twist everything
and diminish our feelings for each other.

01:32.398 --> 01:36.067
You know, I give up. It's
amazing how you keep finding new

01:36.135 --> 01:42.774
and creative ways to screw up your life.

01:43.843 --> 01:47.546
All right, we'll take care of
Jenna, but get me the name of

01:47.613 --> 01:49.848
this doctor in Brazil
so I can check him out.

01:49.916 --> 01:51.283
Thanks. I will.

01:51.350 --> 01:52.751
Why you doing this?

01:52.818 --> 01:54.152
I can't stop him anymore than

01:54.220 --> 01:55.387
I can't stop you. All I can do is

01:55.454 --> 01:57.122
try to protect my granddaughter.

01:57.190 --> 01:58.056
Where is she?

01:58.124 --> 02:00.492
She's sleeping.

02:00.560 --> 02:02.961
Maybe when you get back
I'll let you see her.

02:03.029 --> 02:05.764
Oh, well, you can't do
this, she's my daughter.

02:05.831 --> 02:08.532
And you're abandoning her to
lie down with that she-devil.

02:08.601 --> 02:12.270
Now, get the hell out of here, or I
swear to God you'll never see her again.

02:12.338 --> 02:14.272
Ok.

9? Oh! Dammit, dammit. Dammit.

03:22.856 --> 03:24.356
You know, you guys are gonna

03:24.424 --> 03:31.697
have to get an intern, because
I can't be doing this all day.

03:31.765 --> 03:33.565
Why you looking at me like that?

03:33.633 --> 03:35.667
I think she's ready, don't you?

03:35.735 --> 03:38.370
Definitely.

03:38.438 --> 03:41.473
Put this on.

03:41.541 --> 03:46.445
It's not my birthday, so I'm just assuming
you're taking me in front of a firing squad.

03:49.849 --> 03:54.086
Surprise.

03:54.154 --> 03:55.788
Is this a joke?

03:55.855 --> 03:58.023
A joke would have been putting
your name first on the sign.

03:58.091 --> 04:00.025
I thought it looked best
underneath ours, like you're

04:00.093 --> 04:03.462
supporting us, which is
what you've always done.

04:03.530 --> 04:05.230
Welcome to the practice, partner.

04:05.298 --> 04:08.867
Yep. Lawyer should be getting you
the paperwork in the next few days.

04:08.935 --> 04:10.035
What about the baby?

04:10.103 --> 04:11.637
He doesn't have to sign anything.

04:11.704 --> 04:14.173
I mean, I can't ask for my
first official business as

04:14.240 --> 04:16.442
partner to take maternity leave.

04:16.509 --> 04:19.745
You won't have to. I'm having
a nursery put in. You can keep

04:19.813 --> 04:21.180
the little guy around all the time.

04:21.247 --> 04:21.846
You never told me that.

04:21.915 --> 04:24.450
I know. I was thinking you two
are the closest thing I have

04:24.517 --> 04:28.654
to family now. And I want to
make sure we all stick together.

04:28.721 --> 04:33.625
Sean, thank you, I am so
flattered. This has been a dream

04:33.693 --> 04:36.795
for years. I mean, I don't
even know what to say.

04:36.863 --> 04:40.365
Yeah, we're gonna help you with that, too.

04:40.433 --> 04:45.370
Tell me what you don't like
about yourself, Mr. Yoshimura.

04:45.438 --> 04:50.008
What's not to like? I'm
an actor. Over 100 films.

04:50.076 --> 04:52.377
I thought you looked familiar.
What would I have seen you in?

04:52.445 --> 04:57.583
That would be hard to say.
I only really work in Japan.

04:57.650 --> 04:59.485
Could you give me a couple of titles?

04:59.552 --> 05:02.621
They are what you would call adult affair.

05:02.689 --> 05:04.223
You mean...

05:04.290 --> 05:05.390
Yes.

05:05.458 --> 05:08.093
Gosh, you lucky bastard.

05:08.161 --> 05:10.229
So what brings you to the States?

05:10.296 --> 05:12.397
I'm hoping to cross over.

05:12.465 --> 05:16.935
America has the biggest market
in adult movies in the world.

05:17.003 --> 05:20.873
Well, judging from your excellent skin
tone, I think a facelift, perhaps an eyelift.

05:20.940 --> 05:24.276
We could shave 20 years
off your appearance.

05:24.344 --> 05:26.211
They want to make you look younger?

05:26.279 --> 05:30.516
The market I'm in works because of my age.

05:30.583 --> 05:32.117
How old are you?

05:32.185 --> 05:37.222
73. For people in my
generation, the movies I make

05:37.290 --> 05:39.558
with the wrinkles and exuberance

05:39.626 --> 05:42.995
say getting old is not the end

05:43.062 --> 05:45.931
of life. You can still have fun.

05:45.999 --> 05:47.266
Wouldn't you say?

05:48.701 --> 05:52.271
How can we help?

05:52.338 --> 05:58.310
I had a heart attack right
after my wife died 6 years ago.

05:58.378 --> 06:00.712
I used to say I almost died from

06:00.780 --> 06:05.317
a broken heart. Truth
was, I was depressed.

06:05.385 --> 06:06.585
You were in mourning.

06:06.653 --> 06:11.390
No, I had nothing to do. But
now I'm in a job where I'm

06:11.457 --> 06:15.060
valued. Most people my age don't

06:15.128 --> 06:18.297
have that anymore. To stay busy,

06:18.364 --> 06:20.065
to do what you love, it has

06:20.133 --> 06:22.301
given me a second chance in

06:22.368 --> 06:26.538
life. Which is why I need
to get rid of the scar.

06:26.606 --> 06:27.573
You want your audience to be

06:27.640 --> 06:28.840
reminded of life when they look

06:28.908 --> 06:31.043
at you on the screen and not death.

06:31.110 --> 06:40.852
And this is America. Old or
young, appearances still do matter.

06:48.228 --> 06:50.896
You know, I always see these
people we operate on as just

06:50.964 --> 06:53.932
patients. You know, how much
do you weigh, do you have any

06:54.000 --> 06:57.169
allergies? I never get to
hear them tell their stories.

06:57.237 --> 06:57.903
And?

06:57.971 --> 07:00.872
And it's harder to judge them.

07:00.940 --> 07:01.640
Uh-huh.

07:01.708 --> 07:05.177
Are you trying to tell us that you're
wrong for judging us after all these years?

07:05.245 --> 07:08.180
I am saying that I have a new
appreciation for what you do,

07:08.248 --> 07:10.315
but it doesn't make
you any less dickheads.

07:10.383 --> 07:11.917
We all knew wt we were getting
in to when we chose this

07:11.985 --> 07:13.719
field of medicine. And we all

07:13.786 --> 07:15.988
knew that some of the
cases would be unsavory.

07:16.055 --> 07:18.557
But worrying about why people
come here gets in the way of

07:18.625 --> 07:21.893
what they're coming here to have done.

07:21.961 --> 07:24.129
Are you stealing meds from the store room?

07:24.197 --> 07:27.833
I, for one, am liking the new.
Sean's attitude, by the way.

07:27.900 --> 07:30.669
We've spent years changing
the way people look. I am

07:30.737 --> 07:35.207
proof-positive that people
can change on the inside, too.

07:35.275 --> 07:40.212
Thank you, Linda.

07:42.282 --> 07:45.450
Oh, my God. We have to have this.

07:45.518 --> 07:47.919
Yeah, it's pretty fantastic.

07:47.987 --> 07:51.690
Sean, what has happened
to our farewell lunch?

07:51.758 --> 07:53.625
Oh, just a few more minutes.
The restaurant's right across

07:53.693 --> 07:58.330
the street. Excuse me, miss.
Do you have one in the back?

07:58.398 --> 08:01.566
Great.

08:01.634 --> 08:04.136
Sean, I was wondering, how's

08:04.203 --> 08:06.772
Liz with all of this? Has
she asked for a lot of help?

08:06.839 --> 08:09.775
Why would you ask that? What
new mother wouldn't want help?

08:09.842 --> 08:15.314
I just wondered if you discussed,
you know, how involved you'll be.

08:15.381 --> 08:17.783
Well, we're not married,
we're not a couple, but I'm not

08:17.850 --> 08:21.386
a sperm bank, either. Oh, look.

08:21.454 --> 08:23.588
Didn't we have this exact one for Conor?

08:23.656 --> 08:27.859
Yeah, I think we did. Sean,
so wait a minute. You haven't

08:27.927 --> 08:32.530
formalized any boundaries,
had any talks about anything?

08:32.597 --> 08:34.732
No. We will. We will.

08:37.636 --> 08:43.508
Sean, can I just ask you, what happened
to your plans to work with Curtis?

08:43.576 --> 08:48.413
Curt... forget about Curtis.

08:48.481 --> 08:51.149
What is going on with you?

08:51.217 --> 08:52.417
Sean.

08:53.152 --> 08:53.752
Look at this.

08:53.820 --> 08:56.888
No, it's not funny. Listen to
me. For the first time in your

08:56.956 --> 09:00.926
life, you can do whatever you
want. You're still relatively

09:00.993 --> 09:03.328
young, you know. You're brilliant.

09:03.396 --> 09:05.664
You know what, I have finally
made some peace with my life,

09:05.732 --> 09:08.467
recommitted myself to the
practice, the partnership.

09:08.534 --> 09:11.703
Liz is a bigger part of the
family than ever. And there

09:11.771 --> 09:13.071
is a baby on the way. Why are

09:13.139 --> 09:15.540
you acting like there's something wrong?

09:15.608 --> 09:22.447
Sean, I just want you
to have your best life.

09:22.515 --> 09:26.017
Ok, you know, maybe I
am just reading too much.

09:26.085 --> 09:29.988
You know what, I think you
feel guilty because you're

09:30.056 --> 09:34.493
taking my kids to London. You're
reading all kinds of things into

09:34.560 --> 09:39.698
everything. I do. Julia, I'm

09:39.766 --> 09:43.635
fine with it. Let's go get some lunch.

09:43.703 --> 09:47.939
Oh, look at this. Look
at this rocking chair. Ha!

10:02.355 --> 10:03.989
Hudson, get him out of here.

10:04.056 --> 10:07.259
Hudson and I have a little understanding.

10:07.326 --> 10:09.995
Take it away, Hudson.

10:10.062 --> 10:13.432
You and I have no business
whatsoever to discuss.

10:13.499 --> 10:15.267
Oh, ok. I guess I'll take.

10:15.334 --> 10:19.571
Rafael's surgery off the books, then.

10:22.542 --> 10:25.544
May I? It's really too
good a year to go to waste.

10:25.611 --> 10:26.378
What are your terms?

10:26.446 --> 10:28.447
Oh, come on, sweetie pie.

10:28.514 --> 10:30.148
Just have a little think about it.

10:30.216 --> 10:33.051
You'll operate on my son if I leave yours.

10:33.886 --> 10:36.421
You really do have the heart
of a negotiator, don't you?

10:36.489 --> 10:39.157
I love Matt. I care about him
deeply. If you think that...

10:39.225 --> 10:39.991
I think that you would do

10:40.059 --> 10:42.194
anything possible to get what you want.

10:42.261 --> 10:43.762
And what makes you think
Matt is not what I want?

10:43.830 --> 10:44.563
Because of the way you look

10:44.630 --> 10:46.765
at him. You look at him like you

10:46.833 --> 10:49.334
own him. That's not love.

10:49.402 --> 10:50.936
How the hell would you know?

10:51.003 --> 10:56.908
Because I've seen the
way you look at Rafael.

10:56.976 --> 10:59.311
Fine. Fix my baby. Make him

10:59.378 --> 11:02.447
the way God intended him to be.

11:02.515 --> 11:05.217
And I'll tell Matt I'm not...

11:05.284 --> 11:07.052
available.

11:07.119 --> 11:09.688
Do me a favor.

11:09.755 --> 11:11.690
Let him down easy, would you?

11:11.757 --> 11:18.263
Stupid shit actually thinks you love him.

11:18.331 --> 11:20.365
Hudson, we're good.

11:33.342 --> 11:34.675
Do you think this is gonna work?

11:34.743 --> 11:35.343
Ava just wants her baby

11:35.410 --> 11:38.212
fixed. It's what she wanted all along.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.548
Hey, not to interrupt, but...

11:40.616 --> 11:41.282
What are you doing here?

11:41.350 --> 11:44.285
Well, I just wanted to thank
you for doing the surgery. It

11:44.353 --> 11:45.987
means the world to Ava and me.

11:46.054 --> 11:48.556
Don't move.

11:48.624 --> 11:49.991
So tell me, why did Matt just

11:50.058 --> 11:51.225
come in gushing about how happy

11:51.293 --> 11:53.427
he is that we're doing the surgery.

11:53.495 --> 11:55.096
Well, it has to be this way,

11:55.163 --> 11:57.064
don't you see? You have no real

11:57.132 --> 11:58.866
desire to help me or my child.

11:58.934 --> 12:00.968
You're right about that. I

12:01.036 --> 12:02.570
tell you one thing, ok, that kid

12:02.638 --> 12:04.271
is not gonna see a scalpel until

12:04.339 --> 12:05.806
you come up with your end of the deal.

12:05.874 --> 12:09.343
You don't trust me? And I
don't trust you. So as soon as

12:09.411 --> 12:11.479
you begin the operation, I'll
tell Matt he's not part of our

12:11.546 --> 12:15.650
future. It'll happen at the same time.

12:42.210 --> 12:43.310
15 blade.

13:12.106 --> 13:14.641
This isn't happening, Matt.

13:14.709 --> 13:16.176
Don't worry, he's gonna be

13:16.244 --> 13:19.012
fine. He's gonna be perfect.

13:19.080 --> 13:23.217
That's not what I'm talking about.

13:23.284 --> 13:24.952
You're not leaving with Rafael

13:25.019 --> 13:32.759
and me. We don't need
you. We don't want you.

13:35.463 --> 13:40.567
You came back. You came back
to me, remember? And I know you

13:40.635 --> 13:44.037
love me, Ava, so why are you doing this?

13:44.105 --> 13:46.940
I don't love you, Matt.

13:47.008 --> 13:56.483
The truth is I've never loved you.

14:14.035 --> 14:16.336
Conor's definitely outgrown the sandals.

14:16.404 --> 14:19.339
Annie's definitely outgrown
her Hello Kitty phase.

14:21.109 --> 14:23.410
Oh, God, it's just so hard to

14:23.478 --> 14:27.080
believe that she's such a young lady now.

14:27.148 --> 14:28.048
I bet.

14:28.116 --> 14:32.152
Mm-hmm. What happened to
Sean? That's what I want to

14:32.220 --> 14:36.456
know. You know, why did he
change his mind about Curtis?

14:36.524 --> 14:38.592
He came to his senses is what happened.

14:38.660 --> 14:41.795
Yeah, well, that's what he
says, but he keeps saying these

14:41.863 --> 14:46.133
weird things like, you know,
"I've accepted my life. I'm

14:46.200 --> 14:47.968
embracing who I am," like some

14:48.036 --> 14:51.071
sort of robotic affirmation tape.

14:51.139 --> 14:51.872
Meaning?

14:51.939 --> 14:57.411
Meaning he wanted something
else, and you know that.

14:57.478 --> 15:01.348
I mean, with the kids and I
going to London, I mean, he has

15:01.416 --> 15:04.584
less reason than ever to stay
in a job he doesn't love. And yet

15:04.652 --> 15:07.654
for some reason, he's
more entrenched than ever.

15:07.722 --> 15:08.522
Entrenched.

15:08.589 --> 15:11.091
Well, you love it. But he
doesn't love it anymore. And

15:11.159 --> 15:15.862
he's afraid to make the leap
because he's afraid to leave you.

15:15.930 --> 15:18.098
If he wanted to save the
world, he'd be doing it.

15:18.166 --> 15:21.635
Ok? I think he's better off than
he ever has been. He's happy,

15:21.703 --> 15:25.605
he's upbeat. I mean,
we're having fun again.

15:25.673 --> 15:26.907
He's in denial. He's staving

15:26.974 --> 15:31.244
off his feelings, you know,
like he's shoring up the levee.

15:31.312 --> 15:34.781
You're wrong. Sean doesn't

15:34.849 --> 15:35.882
leave me because I'm different

15:35.950 --> 15:40.087
than everybody else in his life.

15:40.154 --> 15:44.725
I love him.

15:44.792 --> 15:48.028
I need him.

15:48.096 --> 15:52.966
You know what you do,
Christian. You steal people's

15:53.034 --> 16:01.074
souls. Now, you tried it with
me and I got lucky, I escaped. So

16:01.142 --> 16:11.685
I'm gonna pray for Sean. I'm
gonna pray that his luck changes.

16:22.964 --> 16:24.998
Is mine mei or kei?

16:25.066 --> 16:26.066
Hmm?

16:26.768 --> 16:29.169
If mine's mei or... Oh.

16:29.237 --> 16:30.670
This is fantastic.

16:30.738 --> 16:31.738
It was your idea.

16:31.806 --> 16:37.144
I know it was. A man needs an
anchor in his life. I used to

16:37.211 --> 16:42.582
think mine was Julia, Julia
and the kids. That's bullshit.

16:42.650 --> 16:44.017
So what's your anchor?

16:46.354 --> 16:53.660
You. You and the business.
I want to do like 10 tit jobs

16:53.728 --> 17:01.234
a day, and then I just
want to spend the money.

17:01.302 --> 17:02.936
What about all that pro Bono

17:03.004 --> 17:05.605
shit? Maybe you're just
too scared to do that stuff.

17:05.673 --> 17:07.607
I'm not scared.

17:07.675 --> 17:10.644
I just know I want to be here with you.

17:10.711 --> 17:16.550
Hey, do you think we can talk
them into getting implants?

17:16.617 --> 17:18.484
Oh.

17:18.553 --> 17:20.520
Let's dance a little bit.

17:20.588 --> 17:22.455
Let's dance.

17:26.861 --> 17:31.598
Have you ever considered
going up to a "D"? No, really.

17:31.666 --> 17:38.205
You'd be amazed. Just that
little bit of difference can...

17:38.272 --> 17:41.508
Little bit more and you're fantastic.

17:47.682 --> 17:49.382
Have fun, pal.

17:49.450 --> 17:50.784
Huh?

17:53.754 --> 17:55.722
Does anyone want a drink?

17:55.790 --> 17:56.456
Hmm.

17:56.524 --> 18:00.060
Just a little.

18:00.127 --> 18:00.961
Ahh.

18:01.028 --> 18:04.564
Why don't you guys just go get a cab?

18:04.632 --> 18:06.867
Thanks, sweetie.

18:06.934 --> 18:09.135
Bye.

18:09.203 --> 18:10.170
Sorry.

18:10.238 --> 18:14.941
That's ok.

18:17.678 --> 18:22.883
All right. Seany. Come on,
buddy. Come on. Come on, get up.

18:22.950 --> 18:26.152
Get up.

19:11.799 --> 19:14.834
I thought I told you to take a cab.

19:14.902 --> 19:20.340
Hey, sailor.

19:20.408 --> 19:23.043
Kimber?

19:25.446 --> 19:27.013
I missed you so much.

19:27.081 --> 19:28.048
Really?

19:28.115 --> 19:30.650
Yeah.

19:30.718 --> 19:35.989
'Cause I didn't miss you. I
know I said to you that I did,

19:36.057 --> 19:43.163
but not so much. I think
I'm finally free of you now.

19:43.230 --> 19:45.799
Don't say that.

19:45.866 --> 19:49.436
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

19:49.503 --> 19:54.040
And yet you stole my soul.

19:54.108 --> 19:57.944
I had to kill myself to get away from you.

19:58.012 --> 20:03.016
That was the only way out.

20:03.084 --> 20:05.118
And now Sean's killing himself,

20:05.186 --> 20:12.559
too, Christian. If he stays
with you, he's a dead man.

21:20.928 --> 21:27.233
I didn't expect there to
be so much... so many scars.

21:27.301 --> 21:29.636
He'll require a few more procedures.

21:29.704 --> 21:32.539
Will the markings go away evtually?

21:32.606 --> 21:37.577
It'll take a series of operations.
One a year for the next 5 years.

21:37.645 --> 21:43.950
5 years? But then after that,
he'll be fine? Evidence of

21:44.018 --> 21:46.386
the scarification won't be visible?

21:46.454 --> 21:48.588
No. He'll look better, that

21:48.656 --> 21:50.890
much I can promise you, but some

21:50.958 --> 21:57.163
of the scarring will be permanent.

21:57.231 --> 21:58.932
He'll never be perfect.

21:58.999 --> 22:04.537
Nothing that breathes is perfect.

22:04.605 --> 22:09.242
When I was young, my, uh, my
father told me the story of

22:09.310 --> 22:12.979
a bird handler. He decided to
paint the strongest of his birds

22:13.047 --> 22:20.720
a different color. As it flew
toward its flock, they instantly

22:20.788 --> 22:29.696
attacked it, violently
pecking the intruder tdeath.

22:29.764 --> 22:33.099
My father was trying to warn me

22:33.167 --> 22:40.707
to be different is to lead a
life of pain and persecution.

22:40.775 --> 22:46.212
He was right.

22:46.280 --> 22:56.289
I survived it once. I
can't survive it again.

22:56.357 --> 22:58.124
The estate will provide for him.

22:58.192 --> 23:01.528
He'll be well taken care of.

23:01.595 --> 23:06.299
What about love? Will
the estate provide that?

23:06.367 --> 23:09.636
Will life?

23:09.703 --> 23:11.371
I will never understand you.

23:11.438 --> 23:15.074
Sure you do, Sean. Look at
this place. You're the high

23:15.142 --> 23:17.343
priest of conformity. You dance

23:17.411 --> 23:18.711
around the golden calf shouting,

23:18.779 --> 23:20.480
"how you look is who you are."

23:20.548 --> 23:26.386
Different is just another word for ugly.

23:26.453 --> 23:32.292
I'm not the monster, Sean.
I'm just one of its victims.

23:37.264 --> 23:40.033
Be strong, my love.

23:40.100 --> 23:42.569
Survive.

24:04.994 --> 24:06.761
Ok. You ready?

24:07.579 --> 24:09.113
Oh, Sean, I'm scared.

24:09.181 --> 24:11.916
The sign in the lobby
almost gave me an aneurysm.

24:11.983 --> 24:13.984
Ta-da.

24:14.052 --> 24:15.886
What do you think? Hmm?

24:15.954 --> 24:19.590
Isn't it great? You know, we can
even hire some help if we want

24:19.658 --> 24:23.761
to. Someone to watch over him
or her when we're in surgery, but

24:23.829 --> 24:25.796
at least he'll be with us.

24:25.864 --> 24:28.699
Us? This isn't your baby,

24:28.767 --> 24:32.403
Sean. I came to you because
I thought you were respected

24:32.470 --> 24:36.240
the fact that I wanted
to do this on my own.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.875
I'm sorry, Liz, but I thought

24:37.943 --> 24:40.311
I could just be there when you

24:40.378 --> 24:42.046
needed me, when the baby needed me.

24:42.113 --> 24:45.916
The baby isn't gonna
need you. The baby has me.

24:45.984 --> 24:50.454
Fine. Sooner or later, he's
gonna want to know who his dad is.

24:50.522 --> 24:58.229
And I'm gonna tell him or her, and if
they want to look, I'm not gonna stop them.

24:58.296 --> 25:04.702
Well.

25:04.769 --> 25:09.340
At least he won't have
to go far to find me.

25:09.407 --> 25:11.709
I can't stay here, Sean.

25:11.776 --> 25:16.313
I should have known this was
a really stupid, stupid idea. I

25:16.381 --> 25:18.749
mean, how could I expect you to

25:18.817 --> 25:23.988
just give me your sperm
and then want nothing?

25:24.055 --> 25:25.990
But I don't, Liz. I don't want anything.

25:26.057 --> 25:31.328
Oh, Sean. You can lie to
yourself if you want, but I see

25:31.396 --> 25:40.404
it. I mean, I should have seen it before.

25:40.472 --> 25:47.111
This is my chance to be a
parent. You've already had yours.

25:47.178 --> 25:49.480
Where are you gonna go?

25:49.547 --> 25:54.051
I don't know. But don't
want you to come and find us.

25:54.119 --> 25:54.718
Ok.

25:55.587 --> 25:58.689
Promise. Jesus.

25:58.757 --> 26:05.329
Can you at least let me know where
you are? I care about you, Liz.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.598
And I care about you.

26:30.655 --> 26:31.755
Grandpa!

26:31.823 --> 26:33.324
What are you doing home?

26:33.391 --> 26:38.963
The question is, why are you
not in school, toji? Get back

26:39.030 --> 26:43.567
to UCLA. You have
thermodynamics in half an hour.

26:43.635 --> 26:49.373
Yes, sir, grandfather.

26:49.441 --> 26:56.480
Now, what do we have here, little lady?

26:56.548 --> 27:02.953
I've heard about you, grandpa.
Your size is legendary.

27:03.021 --> 27:07.825
I don't know if I could
handle you all by myself.

27:07.892 --> 27:18.869
Don't worry, you don't have to.
I've asked over some friends. Oy!

27:20.205 --> 27:22.740
Oh, grandfather.

27:55.573 --> 27:56.407
Ohh!

27:58.009 --> 28:00.778
He's dead?

28:00.845 --> 28:05.482
Massive heart attack
right after monster orgasm.

28:05.550 --> 28:06.984
I'm so sorry.

28:07.052 --> 28:11.622
Poor guy. I guess the
strain was just too much.

28:11.689 --> 28:13.924
No, not poor guy.

28:20.899 --> 28:25.669
Hiro died a very happy man.

28:25.737 --> 28:31.108
He lived and died the way he wanted to.

28:31.176 --> 28:33.677
We should all be so lucky.

28:46.424 --> 28:51.095
You got one of those for me?

28:51.162 --> 28:53.630
You know, I was afraid you
wouldn't answer the door if you

28:53.698 --> 28:56.600
saw it was me, so I
came up from the beach.

28:56.668 --> 28:58.669
Can I come in?

28:58.736 --> 28:59.937
Only if you're here because

29:00.004 --> 29:03.740
you brought me a new 30
year old bottle of scotch.

29:06.544 --> 29:14.651
I, uh, I came here to
get my daughter back.

29:14.719 --> 29:16.687
Heh.

29:16.754 --> 29:20.624
Ava's gone, Christian.

29:20.692 --> 29:24.261
Now I need to get on with my life.

29:24.329 --> 29:28.832
You know what it is to be
a father, Matt? It's about

29:28.900 --> 29:40.477
sacrifice. Sacrificing
everything you have for your kids.

29:40.545 --> 29:43.647
I haven't seen any part of you

29:43.715 --> 29:49.620
that makes me think that
you're capable of that.

29:49.687 --> 29:51.421
Yes, I am.

29:51.489 --> 29:58.495
When was the last time you did anything
that wasn't about putting your needs first?

29:58.563 --> 30:04.234
Today when I begged Ramona
to get back together with me.

30:04.302 --> 30:06.170
And she actually took you back?

30:06.237 --> 30:08.138
Mm-hmm.

30:09.707 --> 30:10.774
Wait a minute. Wait!

30:10.842 --> 30:11.441
Get away from...

30:11.509 --> 30:12.109
Wait.

30:12.177 --> 30:13.510
You embarrassed me in
front of my entire family.

30:13.578 --> 30:14.845
She still wants to get married?

30:14.913 --> 30:19.783
Yeah. She was an angel
about the whole thing.

30:19.851 --> 30:32.062
I, uh, I told her I was gonna get Jenna
so that we could begin the healing process.

30:32.130 --> 30:34.431
I'm a good father, Christian.

30:34.499 --> 30:37.334
Or...

30:37.402 --> 30:39.469
or I can be.

30:53.751 --> 30:55.719
You ready to go home, sweetheart?

30:55.787 --> 30:56.420
Uh-huh.

30:56.487 --> 30:57.854
Yeah?

30:57.922 --> 31:01.625
Come over here. Give me a hug.

31:01.693 --> 31:04.328
Oh! Oof.

31:04.395 --> 31:08.131
Your daddy's come to take you home. Kiss.

31:08.199 --> 31:14.404
Give me a kiss?

31:14.472 --> 31:16.840
Hi, baby.

31:22.947 --> 31:25.315
I'm gonna make you proud.

31:32.857 --> 31:35.726
Ok.

31:35.793 --> 31:37.494
Ok, here you go.

31:41.499 --> 31:44.101
You're gonna be just fine.

31:44.168 --> 31:49.206
You're strong.

31:49.274 --> 31:55.045
Sean, I just got off the phone with
the place Ava took the baby from.

31:55.113 --> 31:57.414
And?

31:57.482 --> 32:02.386
And they have an affiliate in Phoenix,
and they want to come pick him up tomorrow.

32:02.453 --> 32:06.423
No.

32:06.491 --> 32:09.393
They're gonna come get him,
Sean. I mean, you know, he's

32:09.460 --> 32:13.096
not yours. You can't just
keep him here indefinitely.

32:13.164 --> 32:15.799
I'm not letting him on a
plane for 14 hours after what

32:15.867 --> 32:18.068
he's just been through. Period.

32:18.136 --> 32:20.804
Tell them I will call them
when I think he's ready.

32:26.878 --> 32:28.612
It's ok. Come on.

32:28.680 --> 32:33.350
Oh, come here. I know. I know.

32:39.857 --> 32:41.158
It's ok.

32:41.225 --> 32:43.160
Yeah.

33:01.713 --> 33:04.348
It's ok.

33:04.415 --> 33:07.050
It's ok.

33:22.321 --> 33:23.422
You sure about this, Sean?

33:23.989 --> 33:28.026
Of course I am. This might be the last
time we break bread together as a family.

33:28.093 --> 33:30.562
Next time you'll be a married woman again.

33:30.629 --> 33:32.197
Might be the last time you
get a decent meal in a while,

33:32.264 --> 33:34.265
huh? London isn't exactly
known for its cuisine.

33:34.333 --> 33:36.334
I'll get the spoons, dad.

33:36.402 --> 33:39.704
And you, Liz, you'll be a mother soon.

33:39.772 --> 33:43.474
You guys excited about going to London?

33:43.542 --> 33:44.509
Uh-huh.

33:44.577 --> 33:46.477
You should see Edmund's house.

33:46.545 --> 33:47.612
It's like a castle.

33:47.680 --> 33:50.315
Where's Matt? He and Ramona
should be here by now.

33:50.382 --> 33:53.017
Oh, he called to say that
they couldn't make it.

33:53.085 --> 33:56.721
Something about a sale on
at rug world or whatever.

33:56.789 --> 33:59.524
So we said our goodbyes. Now,

33:59.592 --> 34:02.293
Sean, is there anything
that I can do to help?

34:02.361 --> 34:05.697
Nope. It's all taken care of.

34:05.764 --> 34:11.835
All right. I would like to thank each
of you for being part of my family.

34:11.904 --> 34:12.637
Oh.

34:12.705 --> 34:15.039
I love you all. To cherished memories...

34:15.107 --> 34:16.040
and bright futures.

34:16.108 --> 34:17.742
Bright futures.

34:17.810 --> 34:20.911
Cheers.

34:20.980 --> 34:22.045
All right.

35:33.986 --> 35:36.587
Bye, dad.

35:47.566 --> 35:56.441
I know that the next time we see each other,
it will be as if not a day has gone by.

35:56.508 --> 36:02.180
I'll still be sucking the
champagne and caviar out of life.

36:02.247 --> 36:04.048
I love you.

36:04.116 --> 36:07.585
Look after him for me.

36:07.653 --> 36:15.293
I will.

36:15.361 --> 36:19.497
Call me when you land.

36:19.565 --> 36:22.100
Promise.

36:27.272 --> 36:30.174
Goodbye, Julia.

36:30.242 --> 36:32.377
Bye.

36:39.685 --> 36:41.652
I'll start cleaning.

36:50.929 --> 36:54.932
Where's our 10:00? And why are there
workers messing with our new sign?

36:55.000 --> 36:57.034
I cancelled the consult.

36:57.102 --> 36:59.103
Sit down.

37:14.453 --> 37:17.588
Tell me what you don't
like about yourself.

37:17.656 --> 37:23.294
Yeah, um, we're in surgery all day, so
when are you planning on rescheduling.

37:23.362 --> 37:26.431
Mrs. Howe's consult?

37:30.068 --> 37:32.069
Just answer the question.

37:32.137 --> 37:33.337
Why?

37:33.405 --> 37:35.239
Because we've always used
it to manipulate people into

37:35.307 --> 37:39.043
thinking that they can
change, but they can't.

37:39.111 --> 37:41.145
You want to have an
intellectual conversation

37:41.213 --> 37:45.450
about this? Fine. I do
think people can change.

37:45.517 --> 37:51.589
Look at me. I mean, I was
very unhappy for a long time.

37:51.657 --> 37:56.661
But now I'm settled, I'm content.

37:56.728 --> 38:02.133
Pretending you're not miserable
isn't changing, it's denial.

38:02.201 --> 38:05.570
Did you cancel Mrs. Howe just
so you could give me a hard time?

38:05.637 --> 38:09.607
Sean, I'm trying to
help you here, buddy boy.

38:09.675 --> 38:12.076
You know, I've had thousands of
people sit across this desk from

38:12.144 --> 38:15.413
me, begging me to turn them from
a caterpillar into a butterfly.

38:15.481 --> 38:17.281
The only one I've ever met who

38:17.349 --> 38:19.717
actually has a real chance
at doing that is you.

38:19.785 --> 38:21.619
Me?

38:21.687 --> 38:25.523
Mm-hmm. You.

38:25.591 --> 38:28.059
I know I can't.

38:28.126 --> 38:33.397
Don't want to.

38:33.465 --> 38:37.802
Why would I want to change my
life? I have a great partner.

38:37.870 --> 38:42.406
And aside from this ridiculous
conversation, a thriving

38:42.474 --> 38:48.246
practice. And now that Julia
and the kids are really gone, I'm

38:48.313 --> 38:53.518
free. I am free to see whoever I want. So.

38:53.585 --> 38:55.820
Why are you making this so hard?

38:55.888 --> 39:03.094
Making what so hard?
You're all over the place.

39:03.161 --> 39:06.364
I wanted this to last
forever, you know that.

39:14.873 --> 39:16.674
I'm dissolving our part.

39:16.742 --> 39:19.877
What?

39:22.281 --> 39:25.583
I won't to work with you anymore.

39:25.651 --> 39:29.754
Wh... you can't make a
unilateral decision like that.

39:29.821 --> 39:34.025
Lally speaking, yes, I can.

39:34.092 --> 39:36.427
It's gonna cost me some, but I

39:36.495 --> 39:39.397
already have my attorneys
drawing up the papers.

39:39.464 --> 39:40.197
Oh, bullshit. I'm here on my

39:40.265 --> 39:42.066
terms, and if and when I choose

39:42.134 --> 39:50.942
to leave, it will be on my terms.

40:11.930 --> 40:13.164
Bucharest?

40:13.231 --> 40:18.703
I want you take Rafael back.

40:18.770 --> 40:23.240
I see how you look at him, Sean.

40:23.308 --> 40:28.679
Take him back. See what happens.

40:28.747 --> 40:32.049
These are one-way tickets.

40:32.117 --> 40:36.287
I'm sure they could use you
there. All those sick kids. They

40:36.355 --> 40:41.258
could use a good surgeon,
somebody who wants to spend...

40:41.326 --> 40:47.365
their life healing people.

40:47.432 --> 40:49.300
And in 6 months when I'm

40:49.368 --> 40:52.269
pining for the glamour of Hollywood?

40:52.337 --> 40:59.010
We both know that's not gonna happen.
Besides, you'd have nothing to come back to.

41:07.753 --> 41:11.055
Someday you'll thank me for this.

42:08.680 --> 42:11.248
May I have your attention,
please. TSA paging Mary Ellen

42:11.316 --> 42:15.853
Bovar. Mary Ellen Bovar, please...

42:15.921 --> 42:20.291
Walk you to security?

42:20.358 --> 42:24.328
I couldn't afford first class, but...

42:24.396 --> 42:26.697
I can't let you do this.

42:26.765 --> 42:28.165
I didn't ask your permission.

42:28.233 --> 42:30.468
Slow down. We need to talk.

42:30.535 --> 42:33.537
About Rafael.

42:33.605 --> 42:34.805
What about him?

42:34.873 --> 42:37.308
Well, I know you changed
your mind about adopting him.

42:37.375 --> 42:42.179
Wrong. I abandoned him
like a stray dog with mange.

42:42.247 --> 42:45.816
Look at me, Matt. Get the smoke out
of your eyes and see me for who I am.

42:45.884 --> 42:49.487
I do see you, Ava. Every inch
of you chiseled to perfection.

42:49.554 --> 42:52.289
But being perfect hasn't
made you complete, has it?

42:52.357 --> 42:54.859
And you think you're the
one who can complete me?

42:55.794 --> 42:58.095
I don't love you, Matt.

42:58.163 --> 42:59.830
I don't care.

42:59.898 --> 43:03.934
Well, you should. You're
young, and some day you'll find

43:04.002 --> 43:05.336
someone who loves you back.

43:05.403 --> 43:12.243
Right. Now who's got
the smoke in their eyes?

43:12.310 --> 43:14.178
Hey.

43:14.246 --> 43:16.347
Let me tell you something. I'm

43:16.414 --> 43:17.648
never gonna love anyone as much

43:17.716 --> 43:20.451
as I love you. And I've pretty
much accepted the fact that

43:20.519 --> 43:22.620
you're as good as it's gonna get for me.

43:22.687 --> 43:25.289
What about me? Have you
thought about why I'd want to

43:25.357 --> 43:27.057
spend my life with someone I didn't love?

43:27.125 --> 43:33.130
Because Jenna is as good
as it's gonna get for you.

43:33.198 --> 43:34.965
I may be a total screw-up, but

43:35.033 --> 43:36.567
somehow I've produced a daughter

43:36.635 --> 43:41.806
who is as perfect as a child can be.

43:41.873 --> 43:44.208
Go on, take her.

43:54.486 --> 43:59.990
A little girl of your own to
love and a man who completely

44:00.058 --> 44:05.896
adores you. That's not such
a bad deal, is it? Now tell me

44:05.964 --> 44:08.432
we're not the perfect family.

44:18.810 --> 44:19.844
Here we go.

44:19.911 --> 44:25.349
Oh! Good job.

44:25.417 --> 44:26.217
Passports?

44:26.284 --> 44:29.353
Mm-hmm.

44:29.421 --> 44:30.254
Tickets?

44:31.489 --> 44:34.258
May I have your attention
please. TSA paging Mary Ellen

44:34.326 --> 44:37.027
Bovar. Mary Ellen Bovar...

44:37.095 --> 44:39.029
Have you started interviewing
potential partners yet?

44:39.097 --> 44:43.968
No, I think we'll just keep holding down
the fort on our own for a bit, you know.

44:47.005 --> 44:49.106
Can't replace you, anyway.

44:59.150 --> 45:04.922
Well, I guess this it, huh?

45:04.990 --> 45:06.657
You excited?

45:06.725 --> 45:17.801
Excited, terrified, grateful.

45:17.869 --> 45:21.205
Thank you.

45:21.273 --> 45:23.307
See ya.

45:47.132 --> 45:50.034
This your son?

45:50.101 --> 45:53.871
Yes.

46:39.651 --> 46:41.318
Can I buy you a drink?

46:41.386 --> 46:43.187
I don't drink.

46:43.254 --> 46:44.488
One for the road?

46:44.556 --> 46:48.225
No, thanks. I have to operate tomorrow.

46:48.293 --> 46:53.397
You're a doctor?

46:53.465 --> 46:55.799
Plastic surgeon.
