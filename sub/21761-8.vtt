[stammers] King Julien,

01:38.682 --> 01:41.226
you do know where babies come from, right?

01:41.393 --> 01:43.979
Of course I do, Maurice.

01:44.063 --> 01:45.564
Every full moon,

01:45.647 --> 01:48.149
the male lemur goes to the baby patch

to find where the sky gods
have hidden the new babies.

with a tail as identical

I would be complete.

Ugh! And, I spilled it.

I wouldn't joke

Mort is my son. I found him in the jungle

04:13.670 --> 04:15.380
under the full moon, so it's legal.

04:15.547 --> 04:16.506

04:16.590 --> 04:18.258
is actually older than you are, right?

04:18.425 --> 04:20.761
It's called "unconditional love", Maurice.

04:20.844 --> 04:22.888
Besides, the tails do not lie.

We do not say [whispers] "no"

21:43.636 --> 21:45.471
I'm really not that much older.

21:45.638 --> 21:48.141
The point is, I wanted to believe it.

21:48.224 --> 21:50.851
I wanted a son. You know, Mort,

21:50.935 --> 21:53.395
most of the time you're super annoying.

21:53.562 --> 21:54.647
[chuckling]

21:54.814 --> 21:55.940
But I gotta say,

21:56.107 --> 21:59.860
you were the best fake son I never had.

21:59.944 --> 22:01.112
[stammers] I'm so confused,

22:01.195 --> 22:02.905
I don't even know what to feel right now.

22:03.072 --> 22:04.490
Look! My egg survived!

22:04.573 --> 22:06.284
See? I'm good with children!

22:06.450 --> 22:07.618
Living proof! [cracking]

22:07.785 --> 22:09.036
Like, actually living!

22:09.120 --> 22:09.954
It's hatching!

22:13.249 --> 22:15.084
Oh! He's actually kind of cute.

22:15.251 --> 22:17.295
Yes, he is, the widdle cwocodile--

22:17.377 --> 22:19.797
-Aah!
-[gasping]

22:22.008 --> 22:23.176
Ow! Ow! Ow!

22:23.759 --> 22:27.221
[laughs] Our kids
are playing together, Clover!

22:27.387 --> 22:30.057
Some day when you're
somebody's mom, Mo-Mo,

22:30.141 --> 22:31.267
you'll know the truth.

22:31.349 --> 22:34.687
Parenting is the toughest job
you'll ever love.

22:34.770 --> 22:35.688
[Mort exclaims]

22:36.105 --> 22:40.276
[Mort] I'm okay.
I was only partially, ow, digested.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.612
[pageant music playing]
