♪ ♪

00:50.084 --> 00:51.950
- Betsy.
- Hm?

00:52.019 --> 00:54.252
I think it's time to
make it official.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.422
Would you be mine?

00:57.425 --> 01:00.626
Yours?
Like one of your pet chickens?

01:00.761 --> 01:02.828
Well, you'd be the prettiest
hen in the roost.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.195
(both laugh)

01:05.232 --> 01:06.832
- Man: I will put an end...
- Woman: No!

01:06.834 --> 01:08.033
Man: To your wicked ways.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.969
Betsy!

01:12.039 --> 01:15.039
- Stop! Please!
- What are you doing?

01:15.076 --> 01:16.708
- Please!
- Be careful!

01:16.777 --> 01:18.310
Stop!
Stop, sir!

01:18.312 --> 01:20.312
Wilbur!
Help me!

01:20.314 --> 01:22.247
Wilbur: I can't.
These are new shoes!

01:22.249 --> 01:23.648
Are you in league
with this woman?

01:28.055 --> 01:29.588
Is she?

01:29.590 --> 01:30.922
Is she?!

01:32.793 --> 01:35.160
- Ma'am, let me help you.
- Thank you.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.670
Betsy, are you all right?

01:45.706 --> 01:48.607
This is the spot
where he tried to drown her.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.877
Can you describe this man?

01:51.946 --> 01:54.279
A wiry fellow wearing a vest.

01:54.414 --> 01:55.948
Betsy:
And shabby trousers.

01:55.950 --> 01:57.582
And his hair was
the colour of mud.

02:00.053 --> 02:01.286
And the woman?

02:01.322 --> 02:03.889
Unkempt and wild-eyed.

02:03.891 --> 02:07.025
Betsy: I was going to say
raven-haired and beautiful.

02:07.027 --> 02:10.028
He surely would have killed her
if I hadn't stopped him.

02:10.030 --> 02:12.096
You stopped him?

02:12.133 --> 02:13.631
Well, betsy also helped.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.637
Was the woman hurt?

02:18.706 --> 02:21.973
She seemed fine.
She just walked away.

02:22.009 --> 02:23.375
And the man?

02:23.444 --> 02:25.243
He ran off with his tail
between his legs.

02:26.847 --> 02:27.846
What direction?

02:32.353 --> 02:33.452
Thank you.

02:38.692 --> 02:41.059
(insect buzzing)

02:42.029 --> 02:43.395
Sir!
Sir, stop!

02:45.533 --> 02:47.098
I think that's poison ivy.

02:59.079 --> 03:01.480
A wiry fellow
with shabby trousers

03:01.482 --> 03:03.147
And hair
the colour of mud.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.152
Pardon me, sir.

03:07.287 --> 03:09.221
Detective murdoch,
toronto constabulary.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.290
(grunts)

03:13.460 --> 03:15.427
They are dead.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.428
Every last one of them.

03:18.098 --> 03:19.831
Well, that's terrible,

03:19.867 --> 03:21.366
But we're here
on a different matter.

03:21.501 --> 03:24.068
A young couple stated
that they saw a man,

03:24.104 --> 03:26.337
Matching your description,
down by the don river.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.339
It was I.

03:30.777 --> 03:32.844
They say you tried
to drown a woman.

03:32.846 --> 03:35.246
No.

03:35.282 --> 03:36.915
No, I did not.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.817
I tried to drown a witch.

03:47.528 --> 03:49.394
Murdoch:
You tried to drown a witch?

03:50.431 --> 03:52.731
They float, you know, so...

03:52.866 --> 03:54.933
You have to force them under.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.804
Do not look down your
nose at me, sir.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.807
You do not know the hardships
that I've suffered.

04:02.843 --> 04:03.875
Such as?

04:03.944 --> 04:05.477
I cannot butcher these animals.

04:06.813 --> 04:09.881
She has tainted them
with her curse.

04:11.018 --> 04:13.685
She used the dark arts
to shrivel their hocks

04:13.754 --> 04:15.554
And stop
their hearts.

04:15.689 --> 04:16.888
Shrivel their hocks?

04:17.824 --> 04:19.358
Man:
Their legs, man.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.693
Half of them blackened
and fell off.

04:21.828 --> 04:25.030
And you believe this
witch is responsible?

04:25.032 --> 04:26.297
How?

04:27.501 --> 04:30.502
She lives alone in
a shack by the swamps.

04:31.839 --> 04:34.906
I have seen her,
with my own eyes,

04:34.942 --> 04:37.709
Take flight into
the dark night sky.

04:38.545 --> 04:41.879
I destroyed her demonic shrine

04:41.915 --> 04:46.718
And afterwards I saw her assume
the form of a black fox

04:46.720 --> 04:48.987
And suckle the teats
of the livestock,

04:49.122 --> 04:50.589
Draining them dry.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.457
Good lord.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.192
As god is my witness.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.830
Your story defies
belief, sir.

05:00.301 --> 05:02.000
You doubt me?

05:02.069 --> 05:05.870
Sir, then how do
you explain this?

05:17.484 --> 05:18.550
What is it?

05:19.887 --> 05:23.288
The witch, she staked this
talisman outside my bedroom

05:23.290 --> 05:25.290
To curse my dreams.

05:26.560 --> 05:30.295
Ah, do not touch it!
It is evil.

05:30.430 --> 05:32.364
I'm sure it's harmless, mr...

05:32.499 --> 05:34.499
Wenders.
Gunther wenders.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.569
Killing this witch
would be a virtuous deed,

05:37.704 --> 05:39.104
As far as I'm
concerned.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.239
It would be murder.

05:41.275 --> 05:43.341
As it stands,
it's attempted murder.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.911
Constable higgins,
take this man into custody.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.648
You should be punishing
the witch,

05:49.650 --> 05:51.649
Not the god-fearing man
who stood against her!

05:51.651 --> 05:53.518
Take him down
to the station house

05:53.653 --> 05:56.120
And I'll try to find
this minerva west.

05:56.156 --> 06:01.192
(humming)

06:05.666 --> 06:06.598
Minerva west?

06:08.936 --> 06:10.135
I am she.

06:11.338 --> 06:12.604
Detective william murdoch,
toronto constabulary.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.572
Merry meet, william.

06:15.675 --> 06:17.476
I prefer
detective murdoch.

06:17.478 --> 06:20.311
I'm sure you do,
william.

06:21.581 --> 06:25.383
Um, were you the victim
of an assault this morning?

06:26.153 --> 06:27.385
This morning.

06:27.421 --> 06:29.020
Every morning.

06:29.156 --> 06:32.891
But I have cast a circle
of protection around myself

06:32.893 --> 06:34.759
That no man can breach.

06:34.795 --> 06:37.229
Apparently, mr. Wenders
nearly drowned you.

06:37.364 --> 06:40.365
You're lucky that young couple
came to your rescue.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.634
It was not luck.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.903
Hecate sent those
minions to my aid.

06:45.739 --> 06:46.772
Hecate?

06:47.875 --> 06:50.041
You really should read
more sacred texts.

06:51.378 --> 06:53.378
Obviously our taste in
scriptures differs quite a bit.

06:53.447 --> 06:56.781
And, uh, what is
the source

06:56.784 --> 06:58.783
Of mr. Wenders'
animosity toward you?

06:59.253 --> 07:01.119
Ignorance.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.388
- Fear.
- Of?

07:03.390 --> 07:05.523
Women who live alone
in the woods.

07:07.995 --> 07:10.161
Might this have frightened him?

07:11.632 --> 07:14.465
Acturus panctro sancti sanctum!

07:14.501 --> 07:16.868
You would dare wish a death
curse upon me?

07:17.538 --> 07:18.670
(sighs)

07:18.739 --> 07:21.473
Mr. Wenders claims that
you nailed this to his home.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.675
That is a lie.

07:23.744 --> 07:25.677
I have never sent
a man to his death.

07:27.481 --> 07:28.814
Well, if you didn't
place this curse

07:28.949 --> 07:31.282
Upon mr. Wenders,
then, who did?

07:32.419 --> 07:34.886
You assume that I am
the only witch in toronto.

07:35.889 --> 07:38.190
We hide ourselves
and for good reason.

07:38.325 --> 07:40.424
You've heard of salem,
massachusetts?

07:40.461 --> 07:42.193
The spanish inquisition,
perhaps?

07:42.262 --> 07:44.395
I'm well-versed in history,
miss west.

07:45.899 --> 07:48.300
Hm.
So smug.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.301
You must be catholic.

07:54.341 --> 07:56.107
Cowbane.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.308
Beautiful, yes?

07:57.344 --> 07:59.110
And very toxic.

07:59.246 --> 08:04.049
Miss west, someone or something
killed mr. Wenders' goats.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.384
Would you know
anything about that?

08:06.386 --> 08:08.586
Only that it's a shame.

08:08.655 --> 08:11.389
I have a fondness
for horned beasts.

08:13.327 --> 08:15.192
Well, if there was
any foul play,

08:15.229 --> 08:16.394
I'll find out about it.

08:16.463 --> 08:18.830
In the meantime,
you can rest assured

08:18.832 --> 08:21.533
That mr. Wenders will be
prosecuted for assaulting you.

08:21.668 --> 08:22.867
Do what you will.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.870
I know that gunther wenders

08:25.906 --> 08:27.838
Will meet the fate
that he deserves.

08:33.446 --> 08:34.946
Higgins:
So she admits to being a witch?

08:34.948 --> 08:37.081
- Oh, it's fascinating.
- That's bollocks!

08:37.117 --> 08:40.285
That is, indeed,
what minerva west claims.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.420
But as far as I can tell,
this is just a feud

08:42.489 --> 08:46.424
Between a superstitious man
and a delusional woman.

08:46.493 --> 08:47.725
Sir, what about the goats?

08:47.794 --> 08:50.094
You don't need magic
to kill a goat, higgins.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.764
Minerva west denies
any involvement.

08:52.899 --> 08:55.366
But I am going to have
the remaining carcasses

08:55.402 --> 08:56.768
Tested for poison.

08:56.837 --> 09:00.372
I did observe her tending
to noxious plants.

09:00.507 --> 09:03.908
Her plants may be medicinal
rather than poisonous.

09:03.911 --> 09:08.112
I, for one, would very much
like to meet this witch.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.649
Woman: Gunther?
Where's my gunther?

09:10.784 --> 09:13.184
Please! You must understand,
gunther had to stop her.

09:13.186 --> 09:16.253
May I be of assistance?
Detective murdoch.

09:16.856 --> 09:18.323
Katrina wenders.

09:18.458 --> 09:19.790
You took my husband.

09:20.827 --> 09:22.860
Your husband has admitted
to assaulting--

09:22.930 --> 09:25.162
He was protecting
our family from a witch.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.265
You believe this?

09:28.302 --> 09:29.768
He believes this.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.202
He is german protestant.

09:31.271 --> 09:34.205
It's part of his heritage
and I support my husband.

09:34.274 --> 09:37.609
The witch hunts ended
centuries ago, mrs. Wenders.

09:37.678 --> 09:38.809
Not for gunther.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.145
I see.

09:41.214 --> 09:45.617
But that woman, minerva west,
she is truly wicked.

09:45.619 --> 09:48.086
I've no doubt she will
continue to afflict him

09:48.155 --> 09:50.021
And other
god fearing souls.

09:51.891 --> 09:55.159
Well, then, your husband is
safe and sound in our cells,

09:55.195 --> 09:56.694
So you needn't worry.

09:56.763 --> 10:00.432
Witchcraft cannot be kept out
by brick walls, detective.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.366
He is still vulnerable.

10:02.402 --> 10:03.801
May I see him?

10:12.712 --> 10:14.512
Gunther:
Katrina.

10:14.648 --> 10:17.248
Have you managed to talk
some sense into these fools?

10:17.284 --> 10:18.316
I tried, dear.

10:20.287 --> 10:23.655
So, you are on the side
of the witch.

10:25.058 --> 10:28.059
Absurd accusations will not
help your case, mr. Wenders.

10:28.194 --> 10:30.862
You could be going to prison
for a long time.

10:30.931 --> 10:34.599
How long can a man be imprisoned
for protecting his family?

10:34.734 --> 10:37.334
For attempted murder.

10:37.371 --> 10:40.138
The length of your sentence will
be up to a judge to decide.

10:41.574 --> 10:43.541
Find me a lawyer, katrina.

10:43.610 --> 10:45.743
The best that money can buy.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.879
But, gunther,
we have no money.

10:48.014 --> 10:49.481
You spent it on the goats.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.151
Damn that witch to hell!

11:03.263 --> 11:05.029
Holy moses.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.765
I need you to find out
the cause of death.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.834
Is this goat
a murder victim?

11:09.969 --> 11:11.435
(sighs)

11:11.471 --> 11:14.906
I need to establish motive
in an assault case.

11:14.975 --> 11:17.642
I need to find out if the goat
died of natural causes

11:17.711 --> 11:19.377
Or malicious intervention.

11:20.881 --> 11:23.247
I'm no veterinarian,
but I'll try my best.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.316
And who's accused
of killing it?

11:25.385 --> 11:26.584
Ogden:
A witch?

11:27.688 --> 11:29.787
She believes she's a witch.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.189
She's actually a recluse
who lives in the woods

11:32.225 --> 11:35.326
And tends to a garden
of poisonous plants.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.529
And the man who tried
to kill her?

11:37.664 --> 11:40.664
A german immigrant who imported
all of the superstitions

11:40.701 --> 11:42.066
From the old country.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.069
Where thousands of "witches"
were burned alive

11:45.138 --> 11:46.270
During the
reformation.

11:47.941 --> 11:50.475
History lacks for no proof
of man's brutality.

11:51.878 --> 11:55.012
Many were executed simply
for having medical knowledge.

11:55.014 --> 11:57.481
In an earlier time, I might
have been burned as a witch.

11:58.418 --> 11:59.650
You might have been
my inquisitor.

12:02.789 --> 12:04.823
Your soup's getting cold, dear.
Eat up.

12:21.941 --> 12:23.674
Oh, I'm sorry.
Pardon me. I...

12:26.246 --> 12:27.445
You are haunted.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.648
A dark and bottomless pain

12:30.717 --> 12:32.984
Consumes your every
waking moment.

13:20.433 --> 13:24.401
Diana, mistress of the dawn,
I beseech thee.

13:26.873 --> 13:31.675
Lilith, queen of the night,
I beseech thee.

13:32.646 --> 13:35.980
Hecate,
mother of dark souls,

13:36.115 --> 13:38.049
I beseech thee.

13:42.722 --> 13:45.623
Mistress, queen
and mother, three...

13:45.625 --> 13:49.393
Lend thine ears
and hear this plea

13:49.429 --> 13:52.530
From my foe deliver me.

13:52.665 --> 13:56.134
Malice drives
the vicious man.

13:56.136 --> 13:59.737
Seal his lips
and stay his hand.

13:59.873 --> 14:03.007
This I humbly ask of thee.

14:03.142 --> 14:04.541
By thy will...

14:04.578 --> 14:06.878
So mote it be.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.313
Guard: Mr. Wenders?
Mr. Wenders?

14:11.651 --> 14:14.285
Help!
Somebody, help! Watts!

14:17.224 --> 14:19.023
Detective watts!
Help!

14:24.697 --> 14:25.763
Watts:
Mr. Wenders?

14:26.700 --> 14:29.901
(chanting in foreign language)

14:39.479 --> 14:42.046
The completion of their
ritual coincided precisely

14:42.082 --> 14:45.116
With mr. Wenders'
sudden, agonizing death.

14:45.118 --> 14:47.919
Correlation does not equate
causation, detective.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.321
So it was mere coincidence

14:50.323 --> 14:52.790
The two events
occurred simultaneously?

14:52.792 --> 14:54.525
Well, they d--

14:54.594 --> 14:56.727
You know, it's been said
there are more things

14:56.796 --> 14:58.529
In heaven
and earth

14:58.531 --> 15:00.731
Than are dreamt of
in our philosophies.

15:00.767 --> 15:02.399
Hamlet is a work of fiction.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.202
That doesn't make it untrue.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.539
Chanting, chalk and candles

15:08.575 --> 15:10.408
Cannot kill a man.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.544
Now it is possible that these
so-called witches

15:13.546 --> 15:16.547
Found some other way to bring
about mr. Wenders' death.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.984
Poison, perhaps.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.887
Administered while
he was behind bars?

15:24.223 --> 15:26.824
They may have found a way
to get it into his food.

15:26.860 --> 15:29.026
I'll trace the steps by which

15:29.062 --> 15:30.628
Meals are delivered
to the inmates.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.699
Hart: I found no signs
of trauma to the beast's body.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.502
And the toxicology results?

15:37.637 --> 15:39.136
No poisons detected.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.173
Then how did it die?

15:42.709 --> 15:43.908
Witchcraft.

15:45.244 --> 15:46.510
(chuckles)

15:46.546 --> 15:48.112
I honestly don't know yet,

15:48.148 --> 15:50.047
But I did find
something bizarre.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.382
Go on.

15:51.451 --> 15:55.919
The animal's limbs had become
dry, black, shriveled.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.523
In essence, mummified
while it was still alive.

15:59.993 --> 16:01.926
Mr. Wenders did say that

16:02.061 --> 16:05.462
His goats' limbs seemed
to have fallen off.

16:05.498 --> 16:08.933
Somehow the blood supply
to the limbs had stopped.

16:08.935 --> 16:10.968
But I don't know
what caused it.

16:11.604 --> 16:12.636
Hm.

16:13.873 --> 16:15.807
Well, let's hope your findings
in mr. Wenders' case

16:15.942 --> 16:17.541
Are more
conclusive.

16:18.845 --> 16:21.445
The whole city was
buzzing with gossip

16:21.514 --> 16:23.113
And I was dying to
talk to someone.

16:24.617 --> 16:25.616
About?

16:25.618 --> 16:27.785
Oh, the witches, of course.

16:27.854 --> 16:29.954
They've caused quite a stir.

16:29.956 --> 16:32.289
I thought you'd got this
out of your system

16:32.359 --> 16:34.691
After talking my ear off
about it last night.

16:34.728 --> 16:38.429
Well, I mean witches, thomas.
Here in toronto.

16:39.432 --> 16:40.965
For one thing,
they're not witches.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.433
They're just a bunch
of happy dafties

16:42.469 --> 16:43.968
Who can't find
husbands.

16:44.037 --> 16:46.437
But they are in toronto?

16:47.207 --> 16:48.373
Yes.
Why?

16:49.442 --> 16:52.043
Oh, well, I mean
I was just wondering,

16:52.045 --> 16:53.845
If I was a witch,

16:53.847 --> 16:55.446
What neighbourhood
would I live in?

16:56.116 --> 16:57.048
Do you know?

16:58.317 --> 16:59.783
Margaret, you know better than
to waste your time

16:59.819 --> 17:01.252
On this
rubbish.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.788
Well, I was just curious
because I--

17:03.790 --> 17:05.390
I forbid you to pursue
this any further.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.826
I don't like the way
you speak to me, thomas.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.062
Oh, bloody hell, margaret.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.630
I've just come home
for lunch!

17:14.901 --> 17:16.366
None of the other prisoners
got sick from the food.

17:17.737 --> 17:20.671
So, mr. Wenders was deliberately
targeted with a poisoned meal?

17:20.707 --> 17:22.273
I don't see how.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.074
All the meals were prepared
by our usual cook,

17:24.110 --> 17:26.944
Who says she made them all
from the same pot of goulash.

17:28.081 --> 17:29.614
Well, who delivered
the food to the inmates?

17:29.616 --> 17:32.483
The meals were randomly
distributed by our constables.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.685
So no one could have
known which meal

17:34.754 --> 17:36.153
Would be consumed
by mr. Wenders.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.288
Correct.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.856
Katrina: I warned you
that witch was evil!

17:40.159 --> 17:42.259
You did nothing.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.562
And now gunther is dead!

17:44.697 --> 17:46.897
Mrs. Wenders,
my deepest condolences.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.366
Oh, save your condolences.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.567
I am here to claim
my husband's body.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.837
We can't release his body

17:52.839 --> 17:54.671
Until the post mortem
is completed.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.108
And so the indignities
continue.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.777
We are merely trying
to determine the cause

17:59.846 --> 18:01.112
Of your
husband's death.

18:01.114 --> 18:03.180
You know the cause.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.281
And the killer.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.384
Thus far, there is no evidence

18:07.420 --> 18:09.453
That miss west
killed your husband.

18:09.522 --> 18:12.323
She cast a hex
right under your nose.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.192
Have you even questioned her?

18:15.161 --> 18:17.327
Murdoch:
Miss west, I don't believe

18:17.363 --> 18:20.264
The ritual you performed
outside of our station house

18:20.333 --> 18:22.199
Killed mr. Wenders.

18:22.335 --> 18:23.334
You are correct.

18:23.469 --> 18:25.870
I cast my intention to silence
his tongue

18:25.872 --> 18:29.740
And to stop his harassment,
not to kill him.

18:29.876 --> 18:32.476
Who were the women
who accompanied you?

18:32.512 --> 18:34.545
My apprentices.

18:34.581 --> 18:37.481
I only know them by the names
they chose for themselves:

18:37.550 --> 18:40.050
Elsbeth nighthawk
and persephone jade.

18:41.220 --> 18:42.753
Where might we find them?

18:42.755 --> 18:44.222
I haven't asked
where they live.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.891
But they will be
joining me tonight

18:46.893 --> 18:48.325
For the full moon
sabbath.

18:49.295 --> 18:50.895
I can inquire then,
if you like.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.631
Don't touch that.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.101
Might this be your grimoire?

18:57.103 --> 18:58.335
- It is.
- Ah!

18:59.739 --> 19:02.840
A witch's
personal archive

19:02.909 --> 19:05.108
Of potions and incantations.

19:11.384 --> 19:16.187
Belladonna, monkshood,
jimsonweed...

19:17.523 --> 19:19.390
These are all poisons.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.458
Then I'd advise you
not to eat them.

19:26.065 --> 19:27.665
And I said don't touch that!

19:27.800 --> 19:30.735
I'll be taking this book
and this cabinet,

19:30.870 --> 19:32.135
As well as
its contents.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.904
So, you would steal from me
now?

19:33.907 --> 19:35.806
I am seizing them as evidence.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.542
You will regret this.

19:38.578 --> 19:39.510
How so?

19:39.579 --> 19:42.813
Your hands will erupt
in blisters.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.949
You'll writhe in ceaseless pain

19:45.018 --> 19:47.484
And claw at your own flesh.

19:47.554 --> 19:51.622
By the blood of baphomet,
so mote it be.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.026
Right, then.
Watts?

20:03.603 --> 20:06.370
She became irate when we seized
her possessions as evidence.

20:06.406 --> 20:09.373
What was your impression
of miss west, detective?

20:09.409 --> 20:12.109
I must admit
I admire her gumption.

20:12.145 --> 20:14.912
She's resourceful
and independent.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.647
A non-conformist.

20:16.683 --> 20:19.116
And quite possibly a killer.

20:19.185 --> 20:20.617
Detective, your hand.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.521
That might just be
the witch's curse.

20:23.523 --> 20:24.822
Curse?

20:24.957 --> 20:27.191
She warned you
not to touch her book.

20:27.193 --> 20:30.394
She said my hand would
break out in blisters.

20:30.529 --> 20:33.664
And now your hand
has broken out in blisters.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.800
Well, she does have poison ivy
leaves in her cabinet.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.002
Oh!

20:38.004 --> 20:40.604
She probably rubbed it
on the outside of the book.

20:40.607 --> 20:43.073
Some calamine lotion
should break the spell.

20:44.377 --> 20:45.543
(sighs)

20:46.613 --> 20:48.278
Well...

20:48.314 --> 20:50.748
Some of these
ingredients are medicinal,

20:50.883 --> 20:53.751
But many of them
are poisonous.

20:53.886 --> 20:57.221
Which supports the theory that
she poisoned gunther wenders.

20:57.223 --> 20:59.890
But mr. Wenders
was locked in his cell

20:59.926 --> 21:01.092
When his symptoms
struck.

21:01.227 --> 21:04.295
He may have ingested a poison
with a delayed effect.

21:04.430 --> 21:07.965
Could any of miss west's
concoctions achieve that result?

21:09.302 --> 21:10.901
Well, there's one way to find
out.

21:10.970 --> 21:15.172
I wonder if mrs. Hart is up
for some experimentation?

21:21.180 --> 21:23.781
So, what did mr. Wenders'
post-mortem reveal?

21:23.916 --> 21:26.884
His toes and earlobes
showed signs of dry gangrene,

21:26.953 --> 21:28.985
The same condition
I observed in his goat.

21:29.022 --> 21:30.621
But the gangrene
didn't kill him?

21:30.690 --> 21:34.158
No. His lungs
were hyper-inflated

21:34.293 --> 21:36.126
And there was obvious
petechial hemorrhaging.

21:36.195 --> 21:37.595
Well, it sounds
like suffocation.

21:37.730 --> 21:38.829
Indeed.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.798
Gunther wenders
died from asphyxiation

21:40.867 --> 21:44.835
While simultaneously
being affected by convulsions.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.638
And the toxicology report?

21:47.773 --> 21:49.473
No known poisons were found.

21:50.710 --> 21:53.811
Something more exotic
must have been used.

21:55.081 --> 21:58.682
We need to find a poison
that causes hallucinations,

21:58.751 --> 22:01.885
Convulsions, dry gangrene
and asphyxiation.

22:01.921 --> 22:05.155
And which takes effect hours
after being administered.

22:05.191 --> 22:07.191
Let's continue then.

22:14.834 --> 22:19.302
Waft the smoke
through the air and chant,

22:20.239 --> 22:23.240
"sweet demeter
use thy might,

22:23.242 --> 22:26.043
Cleanse the air
this full moon night."

22:26.178 --> 22:29.546
I don't see how this could
have any effect at all.

22:29.582 --> 22:30.814
(ogden laughs)

22:30.883 --> 22:32.649
Perhaps there's something
in the smoke?

22:33.652 --> 22:36.420
Chemically interacts
with the poison?

22:38.324 --> 22:39.656
And the raven's skull?

22:41.227 --> 22:44.995
Well, bones contain calcium,
magnesium, potassium.

22:45.031 --> 22:48.666
Minerals may play a part
in the makeup of the poison?

22:48.801 --> 22:50.134
Hmm.

22:51.804 --> 22:55.606
"rotating your pestle in
a counter-clockwise motion,

22:55.675 --> 22:59.075
Grind the raven's skull
to a fine powder."

23:01.480 --> 23:04.148
Though I walk the crooked path

23:04.150 --> 23:07.218
I fear not god
nor man's pale wrath

23:07.353 --> 23:10.154
A blood moon lights
the trail that's bent

23:10.156 --> 23:12.756
Manifesting my intent.

23:12.759 --> 23:15.192
Deliver me from petty grief...

23:18.030 --> 23:20.363
Ogden and witches:
...Offer succor's sweet relief.

23:21.467 --> 23:23.633
This I offer up to thee.

23:23.669 --> 23:27.304
Hear my prayer, so mote it be.

23:28.841 --> 23:29.940
Now?

23:35.248 --> 23:36.446
Ooh.

23:38.518 --> 23:41.185
Hmm.
And now?

23:41.187 --> 23:43.286
We feed it to the rats.

23:51.531 --> 23:53.464
Blessed be, elsbeth.

23:53.533 --> 23:55.466
Blessed be, minerva.

23:55.601 --> 23:57.668
Blessed be, persephone.

23:57.737 --> 23:59.035
Blessed be, minerva.

24:04.911 --> 24:06.810
Shall we begin
the inquisition?

24:06.879 --> 24:09.413
They're heading in the direction
of mr. Wenders' home.

24:09.482 --> 24:11.215
Perhaps we should follow them.

24:19.025 --> 24:22.092
I don't want to see you go.

24:22.094 --> 24:24.394
I'm going to miss you.
Yeah.

24:26.065 --> 24:27.164
See you tomorrow?

24:29.301 --> 24:30.367
Bye.

24:42.682 --> 24:45.248
Detective murdoch,
toronto constabulary.

24:45.284 --> 24:46.383
What are you doing?

24:46.452 --> 24:48.652
Going to bed.

24:48.787 --> 24:50.721
This is my home.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.858
You're gunther wenders'
daughter?

24:55.361 --> 24:58.361
Well, then, why not
use the door?

24:59.398 --> 25:01.464
Mother worries when
I stay out late.

25:02.468 --> 25:04.801
And how did your
father feel about it?

25:05.338 --> 25:06.870
Why do you care?

25:06.873 --> 25:09.873
Because your father died under
mysterious circumstances.

25:09.942 --> 25:12.008
Mysterious?

25:13.279 --> 25:16.080
You don't seem all that upset
at your father's passing.

25:17.216 --> 25:18.281
Why should I be?

25:19.351 --> 25:21.718
My father hated
everything about me.

25:23.689 --> 25:25.155
That's why I killed him.

25:33.699 --> 25:36.166
- Murdoch: Miss wenders...
- My name is elsbeth nighthawk.

25:38.371 --> 25:41.038
As you wish, miss nighthawk.

25:41.107 --> 25:43.374
You claim you
killed your father.

25:43.509 --> 25:44.641
How did you do it?

25:45.978 --> 25:49.046
I staked a cursed talisman
outside his bedroom window.

25:51.918 --> 25:53.149
You doubt me.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.986
Your talisman was gruesome,

25:57.256 --> 25:59.689
But it's absurd to claim
it has the power to kill.

26:01.460 --> 26:03.393
It should have been
a human heart,

26:03.462 --> 26:05.528
But I was unable
to obtain one.

26:05.565 --> 26:08.933
So, you admit yours
was not effective?

26:09.068 --> 26:10.601
I wouldn't say that.

26:12.204 --> 26:15.772
I found him in the barn,
out of his mind with fear.

26:18.744 --> 26:21.812
Miss wend...
Miss nighthawk,

26:21.814 --> 26:23.813
How did you
kill your father?

26:25.084 --> 26:27.151
I burned a lock
of father's hair

26:27.153 --> 26:28.886
And cast the ash
upon the threshold

26:29.021 --> 26:30.487
Of the police
station.

26:30.523 --> 26:32.756
That time my spell worked.

26:33.659 --> 26:35.492
I don't believe
for one second

26:35.494 --> 26:37.561
That witchcraft
killed your father.

26:37.696 --> 26:39.529
Fine.

26:39.599 --> 26:42.900
If witchcraft isn't real,
what judge will convict me?

26:43.435 --> 26:44.868
(sighs)

26:53.112 --> 26:55.478
What caused your rift
with your father?

26:57.416 --> 27:00.250
I loved with the love
that dare not speak its name.

27:01.854 --> 27:03.253
Persephone is your lover?

27:05.190 --> 27:07.057
Father forbade me to see her.

27:08.594 --> 27:09.959
But I disobeyed.

27:11.530 --> 27:14.131
When I heard father ranting
about the witch in the woods,

27:14.200 --> 27:15.866
I decided to
see for myself.

27:15.935 --> 27:17.367
And?

27:18.304 --> 27:20.203
I liked what I saw.

27:21.741 --> 27:23.073
Men fear minerva.

27:25.210 --> 27:28.244
It's better to be
feared than fearful.

27:29.748 --> 27:32.882
But, since there's no
such thing as witchcraft,

27:32.918 --> 27:34.551
I'll be on
my way.

27:34.620 --> 27:36.153
Can we hold her?

27:36.288 --> 27:38.288
I don't have a choice.

27:38.357 --> 27:40.223
You've confessed
to killing your father

27:40.259 --> 27:42.026
And we will find out
how you did it.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.695
Until then,
you'll remain in custody.

27:44.764 --> 27:46.162
Hm.

27:51.437 --> 27:53.370
I'm looking for
elsbeth nighthawk.

27:54.707 --> 27:57.107
You must be the infamous
witch of the woods.

27:57.109 --> 27:58.308
And you are?

27:58.310 --> 28:00.911
I'm inspector thomas
charles brackenreid.

28:00.913 --> 28:03.714
My wife was quite taken
with the spectacle

28:03.849 --> 28:05.582
You made of yourself
the other night.

28:05.651 --> 28:08.518
Your wife sounds far wiser
than you, inspector.

28:08.554 --> 28:11.121
If you pull another stunt
like that on my doorstep,

28:11.157 --> 28:12.656
You'll end up
behind bars.

28:12.658 --> 28:14.324
On what grounds?

28:14.326 --> 28:17.060
Pretending to be a witch
is illegal in canada.

28:17.129 --> 28:18.728
I'm not pretending.

28:18.764 --> 28:20.263
Rubbish.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.532
I've neither the time
nor the energy

28:22.568 --> 28:24.068
To enlighten your tiny
mind,

28:24.203 --> 28:27.071
So I'll just drop off
this parcel for elsbeth

28:27.206 --> 28:28.472
And be on my way.

28:28.474 --> 28:29.539
What is it?

28:30.609 --> 28:32.810
Just something wholesome
to fill her belly.

28:32.945 --> 28:35.679
We don't allow outside food
to be given to prisoners.

28:38.016 --> 28:40.751
First you steal my most
precious possessions.

28:40.753 --> 28:42.352
Then you imprison my apprentice

28:42.488 --> 28:44.488
And now you're
trying to starve her.

28:44.490 --> 28:47.090
Our prisoners
are humanely cared for.

28:47.093 --> 28:49.425
Up until they're
humanely executed?

28:50.162 --> 28:51.428
Give elsbeth this food.

28:52.598 --> 28:53.696
That'll be right.

28:57.837 --> 29:00.170
I summon the powers
of darkness

29:00.172 --> 29:03.573
To rip the scales
from this fool's eyes.

29:03.642 --> 29:06.443
May his flesh tremble
and his mind reel

29:06.512 --> 29:08.311
With visions
of azazel.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.446
So mote it be.

29:17.656 --> 29:19.323
Same to you
with bloody bells on!

29:19.458 --> 29:20.858
So mote it be!

29:22.328 --> 29:24.127
What are you lot looking at?
Get back to work!

29:38.343 --> 29:39.409
Mmm.

29:49.255 --> 29:50.520
Excuse me?

29:51.924 --> 29:53.389
Yes?

29:58.964 --> 30:00.030
The other night,

30:01.300 --> 30:03.500
You said something to me.

30:03.569 --> 30:05.368
Something...

30:05.404 --> 30:06.970
Very true.

30:08.106 --> 30:09.439
How did you know?

30:10.642 --> 30:12.642
Empathy is one
of my gifts.

30:13.512 --> 30:15.645
Pain radiates from you.

30:17.015 --> 30:18.582
I don't know what to do.

30:19.985 --> 30:23.420
I can't stop feeling
this way and my husband--

30:23.422 --> 30:25.021
Your husband
cannot help you.

30:26.525 --> 30:27.524
I can.

30:38.137 --> 30:41.071
A number of minerva's potions
have proven to be poisonous.

30:41.073 --> 30:43.172
And others had no
effect whatsoever.

30:44.610 --> 30:47.210
Have you determined which was
used to kill mr. Wenders?

30:47.279 --> 30:49.146
Unfortunately, no.

30:49.281 --> 30:50.813
None of these concoctions

30:50.850 --> 30:53.417
Produced the particular
constellation of symptoms

30:53.552 --> 30:55.184
Observed in
mr. Wenders' death.

30:57.389 --> 30:59.055
So your conclusion is...

31:00.226 --> 31:01.257
Witchcraft.

31:05.231 --> 31:07.364
Mrs. Hart,
there is no such thing.

31:10.469 --> 31:12.903
He really dislikes
that response.

31:14.640 --> 31:17.841
...And then,
as the years went by,

31:19.778 --> 31:23.647
My sweet little boy
turned into a conniving,

31:23.649 --> 31:26.182
Angry young man.

31:27.586 --> 31:28.652
And now,

31:29.855 --> 31:31.188
Bobby's just...

31:32.791 --> 31:33.957
Vanished.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.159
Minerva:
I feel your pain.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.995
I have suffered loss as well.

31:40.332 --> 31:42.332
A daughter dead
in childbirth.

31:44.202 --> 31:47.337
Well, you seem
to have recovered.

31:49.541 --> 31:50.807
Would you like to know how?

31:52.511 --> 31:53.477
Please.

31:54.179 --> 31:56.146
I channeled my focus

31:56.148 --> 31:58.581
On the flame of
a single white candle.

31:59.885 --> 32:02.619
As the wax melted, I saw
that the core of my suffering

32:02.754 --> 32:04.821
Was not the loss itself,

32:04.890 --> 32:06.656
But my response to it.

32:08.961 --> 32:10.961
I am a good mother.

32:10.963 --> 32:13.430
I don't understand why
this is happening to me.

32:16.769 --> 32:18.368
Self-pity will cripple you.

32:19.037 --> 32:20.237
Reject it.

32:21.740 --> 32:25.308
Instead, channel your intent on
creating an outcome you desire.

32:26.312 --> 32:28.678
- How do I do that?
- I'll teach you.

32:30.049 --> 32:33.450
First, find a quiet place where
you will not be disturbed.

32:36.755 --> 32:39.055
I've pondered the matter
extensively

32:39.091 --> 32:40.791
And I fail to see a
difference

32:40.926 --> 32:42.926
Between religion
and superstition.

32:42.928 --> 32:45.429
There are obvious
distinctions, watts.

32:45.564 --> 32:46.496
Such as?

32:47.700 --> 32:50.066
Well, to begin with,
we have a set of--

32:50.202 --> 32:53.403
You yourself subscribe to the
belief that a priest

32:53.439 --> 32:56.139
Can magically change
bread and wine

32:56.141 --> 32:59.209
Into the literal body and blood
of jesus christ,

32:59.278 --> 33:01.244
Which you then
eat.

33:01.313 --> 33:02.746
(echoing laughter)

33:02.748 --> 33:04.614
Murdoch: I'm growing tired
of this debate, watts.

33:04.683 --> 33:06.750
What is your opinion on this,
inspector?

33:07.552 --> 33:09.385
Ah? Oh!

33:11.023 --> 33:12.255
Oh!

33:14.893 --> 33:17.894
(laughing)

33:17.963 --> 33:19.762
There!
Stay back!

33:22.735 --> 33:24.768
(echoing laughter)

33:24.903 --> 33:26.302
Ah!

33:26.338 --> 33:29.372
(echoing laughter)

33:29.441 --> 33:30.974
(shouting)

33:31.043 --> 33:32.909
- (cackling)
- (shouting)

33:34.813 --> 33:35.846
Ah!

33:36.782 --> 33:38.614
Get this serpent off my arm!

33:39.518 --> 33:41.217
Get the what off
your which now?

33:42.321 --> 33:44.720
(echoing laughter)

33:46.258 --> 33:48.324
Sir?
Are you quite all right?

33:49.061 --> 33:50.893
Oh.
Oi, look out!

33:52.998 --> 33:54.931
(echoing laughter)

33:54.933 --> 33:57.133
Ah!

33:58.871 --> 34:02.672
(shouting and panting)

34:02.741 --> 34:04.941
Handcuffs!
Handcuffs! Handcuffs!

34:05.010 --> 34:06.609
Fetch dr.
Ogden now!

34:06.678 --> 34:09.212
(echoing laughter)

34:13.218 --> 34:15.017
His pulse is stabilizing.

34:16.422 --> 34:18.755
The ipecac should have purged
whatever's left in your system.

34:20.526 --> 34:21.758
Are you all right, sir?

34:23.195 --> 34:26.028
I've never been so happy to
vomit into a bucket in my life.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.031
What happened?

34:28.967 --> 34:30.199
I don't know.

34:31.036 --> 34:32.535
My heart was racing,

34:33.305 --> 34:34.270
My muscles
went all tingly,

34:35.374 --> 34:36.339
I saw things.

34:37.176 --> 34:38.842
Horrible things.

34:40.079 --> 34:42.312
Was there anything unusual
that you were exposed to?

34:42.447 --> 34:43.679
Or that you consumed?

34:46.985 --> 34:48.184
The sandwich.

34:49.221 --> 34:50.320
A sandwich?

34:57.329 --> 34:59.529
I didn't notice anything
off about it.

34:59.565 --> 35:00.864
It was actually quite tasty.

35:00.999 --> 35:03.200
I feel as if I've
heard of this before.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.067
Yes!

35:05.571 --> 35:06.803
Here it is!

35:06.872 --> 35:09.639
William, look!

35:10.742 --> 35:13.476
These rye grains are
swollen and discolored.

35:13.479 --> 35:15.011
Ergo, ergot.

35:15.013 --> 35:16.546
Ergot?

35:16.681 --> 35:18.882
It's a fungus
that grows on rye.

35:20.586 --> 35:22.285
When ingested

35:22.420 --> 35:26.222
It can cause hallucinations,
convulsions, gangrene.

35:26.358 --> 35:28.291
And with repeated exposure,
even death.

35:29.862 --> 35:32.228
Could that be what
killed mr. Wenders?

35:32.364 --> 35:33.563
It's possible!

35:33.599 --> 35:35.965
And wenders' claims
of seeing flying witches

35:36.001 --> 35:37.300
And what have you.

35:37.336 --> 35:39.435
Could be attributed to ergot-
induced hallucinations.

35:39.505 --> 35:42.972
You said you found dry gangrene
on his ears and toes?

35:43.041 --> 35:45.274
Correct.
As well as in the goat.

35:46.445 --> 35:47.978
All the goats must
have eaten the rye.

35:49.848 --> 35:52.415
Sir, who gave you
the sandwich?

35:54.252 --> 35:55.351
It was the witch.

36:02.895 --> 36:06.530
Miss west, why would you try
to poison elsbeth nighthawk?

36:06.665 --> 36:08.531
Poison elsbeth?

36:08.600 --> 36:10.734
That is a vile accusation.

36:10.869 --> 36:12.869
The sandwich you brought her

36:12.938 --> 36:15.171
Was tainted with
ergot-infected rye.

36:16.241 --> 36:18.474
You then fed that
same tainted rye

36:18.544 --> 36:20.810
To mr. Wenders' goats,
killing them.

36:20.812 --> 36:23.680
You also tricked mr. Wenders
into eating it himself.

36:24.650 --> 36:27.484
I don't understand.
I didn't do...

36:27.486 --> 36:29.219
Our coroner found evidence
of ergot poisoning

36:29.221 --> 36:30.420
In mr. Wenders' body.

36:31.823 --> 36:34.491
Why would you then also try
to kill mr. Wenders' daughter?

36:34.493 --> 36:35.658
But...

36:36.461 --> 36:39.362
I would never harm elsbeth.

36:39.364 --> 36:41.164
I love that child.

36:41.299 --> 36:42.765
She's like a daughter to me.

36:44.937 --> 36:46.102
But the bread...

36:46.138 --> 36:47.370
I didn't bake the bread!

36:48.940 --> 36:50.139
Then who did?

36:59.417 --> 37:00.850
Yes, I baked the bread.

37:00.886 --> 37:02.184
What of it?

37:03.055 --> 37:04.920
You used tainted rye.

37:04.957 --> 37:07.123
You tried to
poison minerva west.

37:07.259 --> 37:09.059
Poison her?

37:09.194 --> 37:10.526
No.

37:11.663 --> 37:13.863
I milled the flour from the
feed that was left

37:13.865 --> 37:15.731
After father's
precious goats died.

37:17.669 --> 37:19.568
I wanted to make
minerva a gift,

37:20.805 --> 37:23.205
To show my gratitude for
all that she has taught me.

37:24.676 --> 37:25.541
I never thought...

37:28.413 --> 37:29.545
Is she all right?

37:32.450 --> 37:35.151
So, the old witch was trying
to poison the young witch?

37:35.220 --> 37:36.953
Ah, no.

37:36.955 --> 37:39.155
Elsbeth nighthawk
baked the bread

37:39.224 --> 37:41.123
And gave it
to minerva west.

37:42.361 --> 37:43.893
So, the young witch was trying
to poison the old witch?

37:43.962 --> 37:45.962
Miss nighthawk denies this.

37:45.964 --> 37:48.230
She was shocked
at the accusation.

37:48.267 --> 37:49.799
Might have been playacting.

37:50.468 --> 37:51.534
I don't think so.

37:52.638 --> 37:55.638
I believe she has genuine
affection for her...

37:55.707 --> 37:57.040
Mentor.

37:58.476 --> 38:00.443
Then gunther wenders died of an
accidental ergot poisoning?

38:01.780 --> 38:03.513
That's possible.

38:03.648 --> 38:05.214
It's not possible.

38:06.652 --> 38:09.185
So, gunther wenders
was not exposed to ergot?

38:09.254 --> 38:11.921
Oh, he was.
But it's not what killed him.

38:11.923 --> 38:13.055
Are you quite sure?

38:13.091 --> 38:14.623
Ogden:
He died of asphyxiation.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.660
Ergotism causes many
of the symptoms he exhibited,

38:17.663 --> 38:18.961
But not
asphyxiation.

38:20.499 --> 38:22.198
So, we have no idea
what killed him?

38:22.234 --> 38:24.200
We do have a theory.

38:24.202 --> 38:26.536
Please don't say witchcraft.

38:26.538 --> 38:27.603
Anaphylaxis.

38:29.074 --> 38:30.807
Brought on by what?

38:30.942 --> 38:31.975
A food intolerance.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.876
Perhaps something
he ate in jail.

38:36.081 --> 38:37.147
What's this about?

38:37.149 --> 38:39.082
Your inmates are gourmets
all of a sudden?

38:39.151 --> 38:42.218
We're not here to critique
your fine work, verona.

38:42.220 --> 38:45.020
I just need to know
if there was anything unusual

38:45.057 --> 38:47.090
About the meal
you made that night.

38:47.092 --> 38:48.291
(clears throat)

38:49.694 --> 38:51.027
(sighs)

38:52.164 --> 38:54.430
It was the same goulash
I make every week.

38:55.467 --> 38:57.367
But there was an incident
earlier that day.

38:57.369 --> 39:00.770
Someone broke into the kitchen,
but they didn't steal anything.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.572
Oof.

39:02.574 --> 39:04.507
What kind of cooking oil
do you use?

39:04.642 --> 39:06.042
Vegetable oil.

39:10.315 --> 39:11.848
That's not vegetable oil.

39:13.085 --> 39:15.584
Soya oil has a strong odour in
its unrefined state.

39:15.620 --> 39:18.321
And it's a common trigger
of anaphylactic reactions

39:18.456 --> 39:20.456
In those who are
sensitive to soybeans.

39:20.592 --> 39:24.326
Someone replaced the chef's
vegetable oil with soya oil.

39:26.398 --> 39:28.197
Someone who
knew mr. Wenders

39:28.266 --> 39:30.200
Would have a fatal
reaction to it.

39:35.807 --> 39:37.540
I know you killed your father.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.341
And I know how you did it.

39:39.378 --> 39:40.743
You've finally come
to appreciate

39:40.812 --> 39:42.278
The power of
the dark arts.

39:42.414 --> 39:43.680
- Bravo.
= greta!

39:43.682 --> 39:44.747
Calm down, mother.

39:44.816 --> 39:47.217
They can't convict me
of witchcraft.

39:47.352 --> 39:48.651
That's the beauty of it.

39:50.021 --> 39:52.955
Miss nighthawk,
no one has ever killed anyone

39:52.991 --> 39:54.690
With witchcraft.

39:54.760 --> 39:58.027
You poisoned your
father and his goats

39:58.063 --> 39:59.395
With tainted
rye grain.

40:00.231 --> 40:01.965
I never fed his damn goats.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.299
It's true.

40:03.301 --> 40:04.834
Gunther fed them himself,

40:04.969 --> 40:06.602
With grain that he scrounged

40:06.671 --> 40:09.439
From the millwright's
garbage bin, the cheapskate.

40:09.441 --> 40:11.340
Father got that grain
from the garbage?

40:14.712 --> 40:16.178
When the ergot didn't...

40:16.214 --> 40:17.280
Who is "ergot"?

40:17.349 --> 40:19.048
You can't invent your own
demons, you know.

40:20.218 --> 40:23.319
When the ergot fungus
didn't kill your father,

40:23.388 --> 40:25.522
You exploited
his sensitivity.

40:25.524 --> 40:27.891
My father?
Sensitive?

40:30.162 --> 40:32.862
Your father had a sensitivity
to soya oil.

40:32.997 --> 40:34.397
That's what killed him.

40:34.466 --> 40:38.067
No, it was the curse
I placed upon him.

40:39.204 --> 40:42.071
The soya oil caused
his throat to swell shut.

40:42.140 --> 40:44.173
My detective watched him die.

40:44.242 --> 40:46.276
Lucky detective.

40:46.278 --> 40:48.277
Miss nighthawk,
have you no compassion?

40:49.815 --> 40:52.081
Your father's death
was horrific.

40:52.217 --> 40:54.016
His limbs seized.

40:54.052 --> 40:56.953
He gasped and clawed
at his throat

40:56.955 --> 40:58.421
In an attempt
to breathe.

41:01.126 --> 41:02.625
And his face
went red as a beet?

41:04.996 --> 41:06.762
His eyes bulged
from the sockets?

41:10.135 --> 41:11.267
Miss nighthawk?

41:13.805 --> 41:15.038
One winter night,

41:16.541 --> 41:17.940
You made us dinner.

41:19.678 --> 41:23.312
Father took a few bites
and he started wheezing.

41:25.650 --> 41:27.483
He turned blue,
thrashing for air.

41:29.688 --> 41:31.787
He collapsed on
the kitchen table.

41:34.159 --> 41:36.725
- And we thought he...
- Greta, be still.

41:40.332 --> 41:41.864
You did this for me.

41:44.802 --> 41:46.135
Thank you, mother.

41:48.240 --> 41:49.605
Thank you.

41:50.775 --> 41:51.907
Thank you.

41:57.349 --> 41:58.948
When I learned
he could be released,

41:58.984 --> 42:01.850
I thought this was
our only chance to flee.

42:02.888 --> 42:04.420
You were planning to
leave your husband?

42:05.390 --> 42:08.157
Gunther was a selfish,
cruel man.

42:08.159 --> 42:09.224
A bully.

42:09.928 --> 42:11.027
The way he treated greta.

42:12.497 --> 42:14.197
She only wants to be happy.

42:15.300 --> 42:16.499
And if that girl makes
her happy, then...

42:18.003 --> 42:21.170
I've been saving money to take
her away from that house,

42:21.239 --> 42:23.505
But gunther found it

42:23.542 --> 42:25.741
And stole it
to buy those goats.

42:28.647 --> 42:31.747
You knew of your husband's
sensitivity to soya oil,

42:31.783 --> 42:35.551
So you snuck some into
the cook's pantry to poison him,

42:35.587 --> 42:38.654
Hoping the witch
would be blamed.

42:40.659 --> 42:41.724
I did.

42:42.427 --> 42:44.393
I'm glad he's dead.

42:45.263 --> 42:46.796
Now greta can be free.

42:52.103 --> 42:53.469
Margaret:
Wound and winding

42:53.538 --> 42:55.070
Winding, wound.

42:55.106 --> 42:57.273
Search the air,
the sea, the ground

42:58.209 --> 43:01.044
Until the one who's lost
is found.

43:01.980 --> 43:03.079
Return to me.

43:03.148 --> 43:04.681
Margaret!
Have you lost your mind?

43:04.683 --> 43:06.883
- Leave me alone.
- What's come over you?

43:06.885 --> 43:08.885
I am sick and tired
of waiting

43:09.020 --> 43:11.220
For you to do
something about bobby!

43:11.256 --> 43:12.355
Drop the knife!

43:12.357 --> 43:13.622
No! No!

43:13.658 --> 43:15.458
I know something's troubling
you! Please! Let me help you.

43:15.593 --> 43:17.960
Come here. Come here.
I can help you. I can.

43:18.029 --> 43:20.496
Calm down. Shh.
I can help you.

43:20.565 --> 43:21.964
- I want my son!
- Yes!

43:22.000 --> 43:23.766
Let me go!
Let me go!

43:23.768 --> 43:26.802
