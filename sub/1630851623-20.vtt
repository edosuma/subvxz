12:47.201 --> 12:49.029
That bad, huh?

12:49.072 --> 12:51.683
I... I'm unaccustomed
to my new powers,

12:51.727 --> 12:53.685
so I did not yet see your past.

12:53.729 --> 12:57.080
But you did
see something, right?

12:57.124 --> 12:59.517
I believe it was our future.

13:01.476 --> 13:03.217
Still bad?

13:05.654 --> 13:10.528
Kaleb, it was... beautiful.

13:10.572 --> 13:12.530
[laughs softly]

13:12.574 --> 13:14.663
Then why do you look so scared?

13:14.706 --> 13:16.665
[exhales]

13:16.708 --> 13:20.321
Because we're not destined to
travel down this path together.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.372
Where'd everyone go?

13:28.416 --> 13:30.940
Look who's talking.

13:30.984 --> 13:32.333
When you disappeared,
I decided to hop behind the bar

13:32.376 --> 13:33.813
and take over.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.336
I listened to what
the lost souls had to say,

13:35.379 --> 13:37.599
the same way
that you listened to me.

13:37.642 --> 13:39.949
Most seemed to have
solid breakthroughs.

13:39.993 --> 13:42.430
They'll be back to talk about
what those are with you.

13:43.648 --> 13:45.259
I hope I didn't overstep.

13:45.302 --> 13:47.304
No, you did great.

13:48.305 --> 13:50.090
You deserve Peace, Ethan.

13:50.133 --> 13:52.309
So whenever you're ready.

13:53.354 --> 13:55.095
I'm not sure that I want to.

13:55.138 --> 13:57.271
We talked about this.

13:57.314 --> 13:59.708
No, actually,
we haven't.

13:59.751 --> 14:03.886
My life taught me that there's
no shame in being the sidekick.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.888
Though I'm not sure

14:05.932 --> 14:07.847
"Ferrykid" works as a name.

14:07.890 --> 14:10.371
That's all right.

14:10.414 --> 14:13.069
I prefer "Rescue Guy."

14:14.810 --> 14:16.420
That's perfect timing, actually.

14:17.552 --> 14:19.859
I need help
tracking somebody down.

14:21.251 --> 14:23.123
MG:
I've brought you both here
to talk

14:23.166 --> 14:24.689
some sense into you.

14:24.733 --> 14:26.735
Milton.
Don't Milton me.

14:26.778 --> 14:28.519
Milton is a name
wielded by bullies

14:28.563 --> 14:30.304
or my loved ones,
and right now,

14:30.347 --> 14:32.741
y'all are stuck
dangerously in the middle.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.656
This seems like
a private conversation.

14:34.699 --> 14:36.005
Sit.

14:38.616 --> 14:42.142
You can't close
the school, Dr. Saltzman,

14:42.185 --> 14:44.100
because each one
of these files is a person.

14:44.144 --> 14:45.797
With a life,

14:45.841 --> 14:47.495
who needs a home.

14:47.538 --> 14:49.236
Face facts, MG.

14:49.279 --> 14:51.978
This school is dangerous
for every person in that pile.

14:52.021 --> 14:53.631
Every time we
solve a problem,

14:53.675 --> 14:55.938
another one
just pops up.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.940
Their problems are why

14:57.984 --> 15:00.116
they ended up here
in the first place.To be safe.

15:00.160 --> 15:01.596
The world
is not safe

15:01.639 --> 15:03.685
for supernaturals.

15:03.728 --> 15:04.904
What we have here

15:04.947 --> 15:06.383
is a home.

15:06.427 --> 15:07.950
A family.

15:07.994 --> 15:10.561
You are breaking up
the Squad.

15:10.605 --> 15:12.694
Do you really think
that I want to do this?

15:12.737 --> 15:14.391
Caroline and I

15:14.435 --> 15:18.787
built this school,
for our daughters.

15:19.875 --> 15:22.617
We've all been through too much.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.706
We need a fresh start.

15:26.055 --> 15:27.317
[scoffs]

15:32.453 --> 15:34.585
That is a load of crap.

15:34.629 --> 15:36.239
You are running
from grief

15:36.283 --> 15:38.241
because you don't want
to hurt anymore.

15:38.285 --> 15:39.939
And in making
this decision

15:39.982 --> 15:42.593
for all of us,
you're doing exactly the thing

15:42.637 --> 15:45.074
that you promised Landon
you wouldn't.

15:47.337 --> 15:51.776
When Josie left,
you made some bad decisions.

15:51.820 --> 15:54.040
So you'd rather
cling onto her

15:54.083 --> 15:58.870
than stay here and face a life
that's different?

16:00.350 --> 16:01.961
So yeah,
like I said,

16:02.004 --> 16:04.137
load of crap.

16:07.923 --> 16:09.969
[sighs]

16:11.448 --> 16:12.536
[hushed chatter]

16:17.672 --> 16:19.848
LIZZIE:
Where do you think you're going?

16:19.891 --> 16:21.937
If I told you,
that'd defeat the point,

16:21.981 --> 16:23.895
because I'd like to be alone.

16:23.939 --> 16:25.941
What's the rush?

16:25.985 --> 16:27.856
We're all gonna
be alone soon enough.

16:27.899 --> 16:29.379
If everyone had accepted that,

16:29.423 --> 16:31.033
they wouldn't be
looking at me like this.

16:31.077 --> 16:33.383
Like I can find a way
to keep the school open.

16:33.427 --> 16:35.385
You, too?

16:35.429 --> 16:38.084
MG's puppy dog eyes hit below
the belt, let me tell you.

16:38.127 --> 16:39.737
And I, like you,

16:39.781 --> 16:42.479
had a solid plan B,
which was running away.

16:42.523 --> 16:44.438
until I got this letter
from Josie.

16:46.222 --> 16:48.181
What did she have to say?

16:48.224 --> 16:50.139
You need to read it.

16:50.183 --> 16:52.707
Because there's something in it
for you, too.

17:03.718 --> 17:05.633
[door opens]

17:05.676 --> 17:07.243
Did you get a witch
to put a barrier spell

17:07.287 --> 17:08.505
around your office?

17:08.549 --> 17:11.117
I bribed Pedro with a candy bar.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.032
Apparently, I overpaid.

17:15.121 --> 17:16.992
[door slams]

17:17.036 --> 17:19.647
Look, Hope, if you are here
to change my mind,

17:19.690 --> 17:21.779
it's like I'm telling everyone.

17:21.823 --> 17:23.085
There's no point.

17:23.129 --> 17:25.957
I came to thank you, actually.

17:26.001 --> 17:29.309
For helping bring
my humanity back.

17:29.352 --> 17:30.397
I can't take credit for that.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.615
That plan was really...

17:31.659 --> 17:33.791
Josie's? I know.

17:34.966 --> 17:38.709
She cast a spell
on this pendant that I gave her,

17:38.753 --> 17:41.147
and sent it to my family
in New Orleans.

17:41.190 --> 17:43.758
That's how my humanity
was able to break through.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.717
Anyway, she doesn't
need it anymore,

17:46.761 --> 17:48.893
and she asked me to give it
to someone who does,

17:48.937 --> 17:50.417
and I thought...

17:51.722 --> 17:53.115
...that person could be you.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.248
Just in case
there's a little voice

17:55.291 --> 17:57.337
inside of your head,

17:57.380 --> 18:01.123
trying to break through
all that fear.

18:01.167 --> 18:02.429
To be heard.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.045
[door opens]

18:10.089 --> 18:11.307
[door closes]

18:17.270 --> 18:18.880
LANDON:
Any luck?

18:18.923 --> 18:21.361
ETHAN:Sort of. Word
on Limbo Street

18:21.404 --> 18:22.666
is that he
already left town.

18:24.755 --> 18:27.584
I thought that that
was a good thing.

18:27.628 --> 18:29.456
Of course, it is,
I just, I was just hoping

18:29.499 --> 18:30.979
I could help a friend with
something they really needed.

18:31.022 --> 18:32.589
But the only way
to contact Peace

18:32.633 --> 18:34.243
is to actually be at Peace.

18:34.287 --> 18:36.419
Which isn't an option
for The Ferryman, so...

18:40.119 --> 18:41.772
Unless...

18:41.816 --> 18:43.687
Unless what?

18:43.731 --> 18:47.169
You change your mind about
how you want to spend eternity.

18:47.213 --> 18:49.911
BEN:
Is this going to hurt?

18:51.217 --> 18:53.828
Finch told me that wolfsbane,
and I quote,

18:53.871 --> 18:55.264
"Burns like a bitch."

18:55.308 --> 18:57.179
Yeah, that's the whole point.

18:57.223 --> 18:59.312
Drop it in.

19:04.839 --> 19:07.581
Okay. Hit me.

19:13.717 --> 19:15.284
Well, that answers that.

19:15.328 --> 19:17.199
Why are you not in pain?

19:18.722 --> 19:21.464
The only reason I could think of
is that I died yesterday.

19:21.508 --> 19:23.684
So I thought, "What if
being brought back to life

19:23.727 --> 19:25.120
reset my curse?"

19:25.164 --> 19:28.254
Kind of like your dad dying
broke yours?

19:28.297 --> 19:31.257
You don't think
you're a werewolf anymore.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.740
Well, I know I'm not, now.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.396
And how do you feel about that?

19:43.269 --> 19:45.923
I feel...

19:45.967 --> 19:49.318
like I've changed a lot lately,

19:49.362 --> 19:53.844
in ways that I'm really
proud of.

19:55.368 --> 19:56.978
Being a wolf

19:57.021 --> 19:59.937
and leader of the pack
has always defined me.

19:59.981 --> 20:03.767
So maybe this is someone's way
of telling me

20:03.811 --> 20:07.423
I'm supposed to find out
who I am without that.

20:09.425 --> 20:11.384
As someone newly freed
from that which defined him

20:11.427 --> 20:15.083
for millennia, I understand.

20:17.041 --> 20:19.043
But...

20:19.087 --> 20:22.873
if you're going to be
searching for something...

20:26.007 --> 20:27.182
...please just consider
letting me be a part

20:27.226 --> 20:28.923

Remember? The one that
makes quiet things heard?

21:53.921 --> 21:55.488
Well, it got me to
thinking somehow,

21:55.531 --> 21:58.708
deep inside of you,
even the smallest voice

21:58.752 --> 22:01.189
finds a way to speak its truth.

22:01.232 --> 22:03.452
That's one of the best
things about you.

22:03.496 --> 22:07.587
I have always had
a million voices

22:07.630 --> 22:11.155
in my head screaming
to be heard.

22:11.199 --> 22:14.245
When you died,
a part of me felt like

22:14.289 --> 22:16.247
there was no one left
in my life

22:16.291 --> 22:18.989
who would want to help me
sort them all out.

22:19.033 --> 22:21.340
The good from the bad.

22:23.167 --> 22:27.302
I'm sorry it took that happening
for me to tell you that, but...

22:27.346 --> 22:30.349
you're my pendant.

22:34.831 --> 22:36.137
Better late than never.

22:37.921 --> 22:40.620
So where do we go
from here?

22:40.663 --> 22:45.407
Josie found another school
she wants to go to in Europe.

22:45.451 --> 22:48.192
She sounds happy.

22:48.236 --> 22:50.934
So of course I wanted
to jump on a plane

22:50.978 --> 22:55.156
and chase after her;
chase that happiness, too.

22:55.199 --> 22:57.941
But you were right.

22:57.985 --> 22:59.595
I wouldn't be running to her,

22:59.639 --> 23:01.641
I would be running away
from everything else.

23:01.684 --> 23:05.340
And that's not
who I am anymore.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.603
So if you want to fight

23:07.647 --> 23:11.259
to save this school...

23:11.302 --> 23:12.565
I'm your Squad.

23:14.436 --> 23:16.307
If you'll have me, that is.

23:17.570 --> 23:21.704
I have always wanted you,
Lizzie.

23:21.748 --> 23:25.534
Then you should probably
kiss me right now.

23:29.712 --> 23:30.887

23:30.931 --> 23:32.889

don't you think?

23:40.375 --> 23:41.985

23:42.029 --> 23:44.858
I'm sorry, I suck at vamping.

23:44.901 --> 23:47.164
We'll add it to the list
of things we need to work on.

23:47.208 --> 23:49.689
Won't we, Milton?

You don't have to do that.

23:58.132 --> 24:00.439
You're not the pup anymore.

24:00.482 --> 24:02.136
I know.

24:02.179 --> 24:03.746
But I'm only resistant when

24:03.790 --> 24:05.269
someone's trying to
make me do it.

24:05.313 --> 24:07.141
So it's cool.

24:07.184 --> 24:08.838
[chuckles]

24:08.882 --> 24:10.710
How's the pack
taking the news?

24:10.753 --> 24:12.625
You know wolves.

24:12.668 --> 24:15.149
We're not as emo
as vamps and witches.

24:15.192 --> 24:17.630
So held a little
workout sesh

24:17.673 --> 24:19.327
to get their minds
off the fact that the sweet gym

24:19.370 --> 24:20.502
and all-you-can-eat breakfasts
aren't gonna be

24:20.546 --> 24:22.591
available
to them anymore.

24:22.635 --> 24:24.680
Yeah.

if the school closes,

anything else for us.

24:33.863 --> 24:36.387
If that's what the alpha says.

24:36.431 --> 24:39.216
That's why I asked.

24:39.260 --> 24:41.523
And before you say no,

24:41.567 --> 24:42.959
at least acknowledge the fact

24:43.003 --> 24:45.832
that you've already been
acting as the alpha.

in god stuff.

with him, and I said yes.

the one to do it.

go the wrong way,

to keep 'em together.

how much this place

everything else seems to.

38:58.292 --> 39:01.164
Can I ask if you're happy?

39:02.122 --> 39:05.517
Happiness is an emotion,
so that's a tricky one.

39:05.560 --> 39:08.084
But I know where I belong
when I'm in Limbo.

39:08.128 --> 39:11.087
All I've ever wanted
is a home.

39:13.220 --> 39:16.049
Just don't be a stranger, okay?

39:18.921 --> 39:20.445
Hope Mikaelson.

39:21.924 --> 39:23.273
For as much as
we've both changed,

39:23.317 --> 39:25.406
that's one thing
we could never be.

39:25.450 --> 39:28.453
I'll always love you, Landon.

39:28.496 --> 39:31.238
And you'll forever know
where to find me.
