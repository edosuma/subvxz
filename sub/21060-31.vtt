00:50.310 --> 00:53.413
I feel that I have
more opportunities here.

a field training officer.

there'’s a lotta opportunity

01:02.551 --> 01:06.068
within this department
that you wouldn'’t get
at a big agency.

01:07.862 --> 01:09.862

this motorcycle in front of us,

01:09.896 --> 01:11.310

no license plate light

01:11.344 --> 01:13.896

He'’s gonna be
callin'’ out the pursuit,

02:44.379 --> 02:45.793
so I'’m just gonna keep
followin'’ him.

02:45.827 --> 02:47.862

03:07.413 --> 03:09.448
goin'’ on opposite,
right of the freeway.

03:09.482 --> 03:12.965

he'’s not yielding at all.

-All right, so we'’re gettin' off
at the City of Ontario.

03:47.655 --> 03:52.275

When he went down Citrus...
-On the other side of the road.

04:33.206 --> 04:34.758
-...he was
in the opposing lanes,

04:34.793 --> 04:37.724
splitting traffic.
He was gonna kill himself.

04:37.758 --> 04:39.482
He'’s lucky he's alive.

04:46.689 --> 04:48.448
-Be careful, man.

04:48.482 --> 04:51.931
-Do you have a warrant?
-No, it'’s 'cause I'’m
on probation, straight up.

04:51.965 --> 04:53.931
I haven'’t checked in.
-Got a warrant?

04:53.965 --> 04:55.931
-Basically-- Yeah.
Basically--
-Motorcycle stolen?

04:55.965 --> 04:58.034
-No, it'’s not stolen,
and I got the registration--

04:58.068 --> 04:59.793
-So you did all that,
just '’cause you had a warrant?

04:59.827 --> 05:01.517
-Yeah, '’cause I signed for--
-Come on, man.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.620
-I signed for a bad deal,
and basically I just
started working.

05:04.655 --> 05:07.586
You can check my background
and everything, I just started
working, like, two weeks ago.

05:07.620 --> 05:10.206
I barely got this bike.
And I didn'’t have the tag,

05:10.241 --> 05:12.241
so I knew I was gonna
get pulled over and I haven'’t
checked in.

05:12.275 --> 05:15.758
And yeah, I decided to run.
I know, uh, it was a bad idea,

05:15.793 --> 05:18.206
but...
-All that?
All that for a warrant?

05:18.241 --> 05:21.379
-Yeah, dude. Straight up.
I'’m not gonna lie to you.

05:21.413 --> 05:25.344
-It seemed like he was tryin'’
to get his bike into gear,

05:25.379 --> 05:27.068
'’cause he kept
kickin'’ down on it.

05:27.103 --> 05:29.379
And then at whatever point,
his bike locked up,

05:29.413 --> 05:32.310
and actually hit the front
of my car, and he fell down.

05:32.344 --> 05:36.413
So then we took him
into custody and, uh,
that was pretty much it, man.

05:36.448 --> 05:38.206
So there was
pretty moderate traffic,

05:38.241 --> 05:40.724
and, you know, I'’m just glad
obviously nobody got hurt.

05:40.758 --> 05:43.793
-What was he runnin'’ for?
-Uh, he actually just
informed us

05:43.827 --> 05:47.000
that he has a no bail warrant.
We just confirmed that
with dispatch.

05:47.034 --> 05:49.034
So, he said he didn'’t
wanna go back to jail.

05:49.068 --> 05:50.344
-Good, man. Good job.
-Thank you, sir.

05:50.379 --> 05:52.034
-All right.
-Good job.

05:52.068 --> 05:54.206
-Yeah.
It worked out good.

05:54.241 --> 05:57.620
So I'’m running his information
here, and what I'’m finding out

05:57.655 --> 06:00.655
is that
he has no license at all.

06:00.689 --> 06:02.517
Uh, not only
a motorcycle license,

06:02.551 --> 06:05.482
but he has
no license whatsoever.

06:05.517 --> 06:09.344
Uh, he also has
a no bail warrant
for drug sales,

06:09.379 --> 06:13.896
and his registration
comes back expired
from January of 2016.

06:13.931 --> 06:18.862
So, the bike itself
hasn'’t even been registered
in almost a year and a half.

06:20.448 --> 06:22.103
Hey, David?
-Yeah?

06:22.137 --> 06:24.137
-Hey, man, are you okay,
first of all?

06:24.172 --> 06:26.965
-Oh, I'’m good.
-Okay.
So what happened today, man?

06:28.206 --> 06:32.034
-Um, just try-- try to get a--
-Just tried to get away?

06:32.068 --> 06:34.517
-Yeah.
-Okay. Did you think
you were gonna be able

06:34.551 --> 06:36.862
to outrun me?

06:36.896 --> 06:38.793
Just figured you'’d
give it a shot?
-Yeah.

06:38.827 --> 06:41.517
-Okay, do you realize
how many people you put
in danger today?

06:41.551 --> 06:44.448
-Yeah.
-Including yourself.
I mean, you--

06:44.482 --> 06:46.103
you were riding
on the wrong side
of the road

06:46.137 --> 06:50.000
several times, man,
and-- and if you would'’ve
hit a car head on,

06:50.034 --> 06:51.655
that could'’ve ended
your life, man.

06:51.689 --> 06:53.103
You care about yourself, right?

06:53.137 --> 06:55.241
-Yeah.
-All right, man.
As of right now,

06:55.275 --> 06:58.206
you'’re bein'--
you'’re bein' charged
with, uh, felony evading,

06:58.241 --> 07:00.689
okay?
Uh, you'’re also gonna
have to deal with that

07:00.724 --> 07:02.862
no bail warrant.
All right?

07:02.896 --> 07:05.793
So, the main thing
is nobody got injured today,

07:05.827 --> 07:07.517
and everybody'’s okay.

07:07.551 --> 07:09.586
All right?
Probably won'’t
do that again, right?

07:09.620 --> 07:11.172
-Yeah.
-Okay, man.

07:14.344 --> 07:16.275
-When I got out of school
years ago, was tryin'’
to figure out

07:16.310 --> 07:17.482
what I wanted to do
for a career.

07:17.517 --> 07:19.413
And after thinkin'’
about things, I realized

07:19.448 --> 07:22.724
that my whole family
has a strong military
and law enforcement background.

for apologies now, though, huh?
-I'’m just a little person, bro.

10:12.172 --> 10:14.620
-I hear you, man.
Listen to me. You cooperate

10:14.655 --> 10:17.517
from here on out,
we'’ll try to make this...
-I will.

10:17.551 --> 10:19.655
-...as pain-- painless
as possible, all right?

10:19.689 --> 10:20.931
-I'’m tellin' y'’all,
I'’m so sorry, bro.

10:20.965 --> 10:22.206
-Listen to me.
Listen to me.

10:22.241 --> 10:23.586
Have a seat for me.

10:23.620 --> 10:26.689
-All I-- All I have
is a suspended license.
-Look at me.

10:26.724 --> 10:28.103
-That'’s my-- that was
the whole--

10:28.137 --> 10:30.689
-I'’ll come talk to you
in a second, hold on.

10:30.724 --> 10:34.137
-We had a neighboring
agency was attempting to make
a traffic stop on this vehicle.

10:34.172 --> 10:37.758
They ended up comin'’ towards
our jurisdiction, so we jumped
in behind '’em to help out.

10:37.793 --> 10:41.103
They turned down here.
Ended up goin'’ right
into a dead end.

10:41.137 --> 10:44.482
There was nowhere left to go,
so they ran... into this
cemetery here.

10:44.517 --> 10:47.724
They'’re checkin'
the cemetery now to see
if he dumped anything.

10:47.758 --> 10:50.172
He just ran, straight shot,
to where Peewee got him.

10:50.206 --> 10:52.241
And then it looks like
where he ripped his shirt
right there.

10:52.275 --> 10:55.034
-I'’m just bein' honest.
My mom just died, bro.

10:55.068 --> 10:56.758
I'’ve been goin'
through a lot, bro.

10:56.793 --> 10:59.241
-I mean, but listen--
-And the cop was pullin'’--
I was leavin'’ from work--

10:59.275 --> 11:00.965
I just left my [bleep] job, bro.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.689
And the guy was gonna
pull me over, and I'’m like,

11:02.724 --> 11:05.206
"Oh, [bleep] man."
-Here'’s my thing--
I can understand all that,

11:05.241 --> 11:06.896
but here'’s my problem
with-- with everything.

11:06.931 --> 11:09.241
-Man, I just--
-The way you were drivin'’,
and the speeds and everything--

11:09.275 --> 11:11.344
listen to me, it'’s a Fri--
it'’s-- it's a weekend,
they got kids,

11:11.379 --> 11:12.931
they got kids,
they got other people out.

11:12.965 --> 11:14.758
-Man, I could kill myself,
man, I feel bad.

11:14.793 --> 11:17.034
-Look, you talk about--
I understand you, you'’re
mournin'’ right now,

11:17.068 --> 11:20.172
but what if you hit somebody?
You'’re gonna put them
in the same position.

11:20.206 --> 11:22.275
-No, I understand. I understand
where you'’re comin' from, man.

11:22.310 --> 11:25.206
I know I was
[bleep] speedin'’, right?

11:25.241 --> 11:27.620
I tried not to run no light,
I didn'’t run a light, but--

11:27.655 --> 11:29.413
-[laughs]
Oh, you ran-- you ran
a few of '’em.

11:29.448 --> 11:31.000
-No, I didn'’t run no light.
-Oh, you did.

11:31.034 --> 11:33.000
-I didn'’t run a light.
-When you hit Willow,
when you were on Moss

11:33.034 --> 11:34.620
and Willow.
-Um, it changed for me.

11:34.655 --> 11:36.586
-Oh, it didn'’t--
-The light changed,
that'’s why I didn't stop.

11:36.620 --> 11:38.793
-Listen to me,
I was the-- I was the unit
right behind you, dude.

11:38.827 --> 11:41.448
-You a Carencro cop?
-No, it'’s in-- in Lafayette.
When you came into Lafayette,

11:41.482 --> 11:44.137
I'’m the one that--
that-- that took over
and was behind you.

11:44.172 --> 11:46.000
-Okay, I understand.
-Are you familiar
with this area?

11:46.034 --> 11:48.241
-No. [laughs]
-Okay, so you didn'’t know
this was a dead end.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.000
-No, sir.
-What'’d you thought
when you--

11:50.034 --> 11:52.344
-No, sir, I'’m-- I--
-When you turned down
the dead end, what'’d you figure?

11:52.379 --> 11:56.827
-I'’m just sayin' I stopped,
I'’m like, "Okay [bleep],
[bleep], where the hell am I?

11:56.862 --> 11:58.620
Oh, damn, [bleep],
I'’m at a dead end."

11:58.655 --> 12:00.000
All y'’all behind me.

12:00.034 --> 12:01.482
-Where were you
tryin'’ to get to?

12:01.517 --> 12:03.758
-I was comin'’ here.
-Like here--

12:03.793 --> 12:04.862
-I was comin'’
to the area, my h--

12:04.896 --> 12:07.034
-This neighborhood?
-Yes, sir. My-- Yes, sir.

12:07.068 --> 12:08.689
-And then your car
just died out?
-Yes, sir.

12:08.724 --> 12:10.482
-'’Cause you were on it
for a while, and then it just--

12:10.517 --> 12:12.448
-I could tell something
was wrong with your car.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.482
-Man, I'’m just so sorry, bro.
Man, I'’m so sorry, man.

12:14.517 --> 12:16.931
-All right, man.
-Um, I'’m just--

12:16.965 --> 12:19.068
-Y-- You got any questions
for me?
-Yeah.

12:19.103 --> 12:21.137
Like, what'’s my--
-All right, right now,
the City of Carencro,

12:21.172 --> 12:24.517
Police Department, is the ones
that initiated the--
the traffic stop.

12:24.551 --> 12:27.379
Whatever charges
they'’re gonna have on you,
in Lafayette you'’re gonna

12:27.413 --> 12:29.931
have aggravated flight
from an officer in Lafayette.
-Okay, so my thing is--

12:29.965 --> 12:31.862
-Plus whatever Carencro
does with you.

12:31.896 --> 12:35.586
-So--
-What, uh-- My thing is...
will I be gettin'’

12:35.620 --> 12:37.482
incarcerated tonight?
-Will you be ge-- what?

12:37.517 --> 12:39.724
-Will I be gettin'’
a citation, will be gettin'’
incarcerated tonight?

12:39.758 --> 12:41.793
-Oh, you'’re
goin'’ to jail tonight.
-Man. Can I-- can I get my--

12:41.827 --> 12:43.655
-Look-- We don'’t
write tickets for car chases.

12:43.689 --> 12:45.551
-I mean-- I understand,
I understand, so, I mean,

12:45.586 --> 12:47.379
just be askin'’ 'cause--
-Suspended driver'’s license?

12:47.413 --> 12:48.620
You probably just got a ticket.

12:48.655 --> 12:50.620
-I think-- I think
that'’s my thing, so uh...

12:50.655 --> 12:53.482
-Is it-- Let me ask you this:
lookin'’ back, is it worth
all this?

12:53.517 --> 12:57.034
-No, I'’m-- I understand--
Sarge, I am-- [stammers]
I panicked.

12:57.068 --> 12:59.068
I friggin'’ panicked, bro.
-You'’re lucky you didn't
get dog bit

12:59.103 --> 13:00.827
or anything like that.
-I friggin'’ panicked, bro,

13:00.862 --> 13:03.034
and that'’s why when I ran,
I seen it, I just stopped, bro.

13:03.068 --> 13:04.620
-All right, man, hang tight.
-[door closes]

13:06.241 --> 13:07.827
So, nothin'’ in the vehicle?

13:07.862 --> 13:10.241
-We didn'’t find nothin', man.
He'’s sayin' it'’s his mom's car.

13:10.275 --> 13:12.206
Yeah, who'’s recently deceased.
-We'’re gonna--

13:12.241 --> 13:14.103
-I think it'’s comin' back to--
it'’s registered to a male,

13:14.137 --> 13:15.827
so we'’re gonna have
to do some checkin'’, figure out

13:15.862 --> 13:17.931
what'’s the deal
with the vehicle.
-We'’re gonna check up on that.

13:17.965 --> 13:20.241
-He'’s suspended.
We hadn'’t ran him
for warrants yet, either, so--

13:20.275 --> 13:22.068
-Okay.
-We don'’t know what else
he'’s got on him, but...

13:22.103 --> 13:24.241
worked out good, though, man,
nobody got hurt.
-Yeah.

13:26.827 --> 13:28.137
-Talkin'’ with people
in the community,

13:28.172 --> 13:30.275
and being able
to relate with them is huge.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.275
If they see you
as this high had mighty person,

13:32.310 --> 13:34.172
they'’re-- they're not gonna
wanna talk to you.

13:34.206 --> 13:36.620
You'’re a citizen
of this community
just as they are.

13:36.655 --> 13:38.344
You'’re just out there
tryin'’ to keep them safe

13:38.379 --> 13:40.620
and help them with their needs,
you know?

13:40.655 --> 13:42.586
That'’s super important
to be able to relate
with them

13:42.620 --> 13:45.206
on a personal level, uh, and...

13:45.241 --> 13:48.000
you know, that'’s what
we try to do out here.

13:49.379 --> 13:52.000
We just had a white Dodge pickup
pass us.

13:52.034 --> 13:54.517
It'’s got no front plate on it.

13:54.551 --> 13:56.034
Looks like it'’s tryin'
to get away from me,

13:56.068 --> 13:57.448
I'’m gonna try
and catch up to it here.

13:58.931 --> 14:02.034
Got one tryin'’ to take off
on me, Florida and Joseph.

14:02.068 --> 14:06.241
It'’s a white Dodge pickup.
-[siren sounding]

14:09.206 --> 14:11.379
-Turn around,
put your hands on the ground!

14:11.413 --> 14:14.068
On the ground!

14:14.103 --> 14:15.758
13, two at gunpoint.

14:15.793 --> 14:18.413
-[men speak indistinctly]
-Both of you, hands up! Now!

14:21.275 --> 14:22.310
-When can I...?

14:26.689 --> 14:29.172
I'’m sorry, sir.
Please, why are you guys
doing this?

14:29.206 --> 14:32.620
-Put your-- Put your hands out!
Put your hands out
like an airplane.

14:32.655 --> 14:34.620
Is there anybody else
in the car?

14:36.689 --> 14:38.724
-They are out, sir.

14:40.793 --> 14:41.931
-Get on the ground!

14:41.965 --> 14:43.620
-I can'’t do that, I'm sorry.
I'’m sorry.

14:45.068 --> 14:46.931
-Knock it off.
-Sorry, I'’m not--

14:46.965 --> 14:51.000
-Who else is in the car?
-My-- My girlfriend Becca.

14:51.034 --> 14:54.586
-Girlfriend Becca,
stick your hands
out the window, now!

14:54.620 --> 14:58.827
-She has a little dog with her.
-That'’s fine, stick 'em
out the window!

14:58.862 --> 15:01.000
You move, you'’re gonna
get tased, you understand me?

15:01.034 --> 15:02.413
-Yes, sir, I do.

15:06.482 --> 15:09.448
-Just please don'’t use that.
-Arms around your back.

15:11.448 --> 15:13.965
-I'’m no gonna resist
anything, sir.

15:15.758 --> 15:17.172
-Sit up.

15:19.275 --> 15:21.275
Turn and face
the patrol car.

15:21.310 --> 15:22.931
Don'’t spit on me, all right?
-I'’m not gonna.

15:22.965 --> 15:25.206
-All right.
Can you tell me
what'’s goin' on, man?

15:25.241 --> 15:28.586
I hit my lights, and started
chasin'’ you through here,

15:28.620 --> 15:30.482
and you'’re haulin',
all the way. Why?

15:30.517 --> 15:31.586
Why are you tryin'’
to get away?

15:31.620 --> 15:32.724
-I didn'’t see you
hit your lights.

15:32.758 --> 15:33.896
I was bringin'’
this gentleman home.

15:33.931 --> 15:35.793
-I live here.
-He lives here.

15:35.827 --> 15:39.448
-So, why the change
in driving from going
super slow, creepin'’ through

15:39.482 --> 15:41.551
that neighborhood,
soon as I turn around...

15:41.586 --> 15:45.551
-I was turning around--
-...you take off, and then I hit
my lights, I hit my siren,

15:45.586 --> 15:48.310
you'’re still goin'.
-I heard your sirens
when I stopped right there

15:48.344 --> 15:50.551
and got out.
-So you mean to tell me
that you had no idea

15:50.586 --> 15:52.724
I was behind you?
-No, sir.

15:52.758 --> 15:54.586
-And you looked
at my patrol car,
and then you took off?

15:54.620 --> 15:56.482
-Yeah, I thought
you kept goin'’.

15:57.931 --> 15:59.379
Honest to God.
-Uh-huh.

15:59.413 --> 16:02.068
That-- That doesn'’t
explain your driving.

16:02.103 --> 16:03.724
How is it that you didn'’t think
I was behind you,

16:03.758 --> 16:05.965
but yet you came flyin'’ out
of the truck with your hands up?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.068
-Because I seen the lights
and the siren, man.

16:08.103 --> 16:11.896
-Okay.
And then, why did you jump up
real quick while I had you

16:11.931 --> 16:13.827
on the ground?
-Because I have a warrant, sir.

16:13.862 --> 16:16.517
-Hm.
Interesting.

16:16.551 --> 16:18.586
Can I put him
in your car real quick?

16:18.620 --> 16:19.931
Come on.
Come on back here.

16:19.965 --> 16:21.379
-Can I say goodbye
to my girlfriend?

16:21.413 --> 16:23.620
-Maybe if you start
tellin'’ me the truth.

16:23.655 --> 16:25.172
Have a seat, bud.

16:26.655 --> 16:28.137
-[mumbles]

16:32.655 --> 16:35.379
-So I know there'’s a dog
in there. Is there anybody else
inside that car?

16:35.413 --> 16:36.862
-My dog.
-Any human in the car?

16:36.896 --> 16:38.931
-Anybody else?
-No, no, no one.

16:38.965 --> 16:40.586
-All right.

16:40.620 --> 16:42.793
Brett, did you just check
on the plate?

16:42.827 --> 16:45.655
-Idaho hasn'’t been
returning apparently
since 8:00 p.m.

16:45.689 --> 16:48.034
-All right.
You tell me what'’s goin' on.

16:48.068 --> 16:51.000
-He-- He-- He didn'’t
say anything. I just said,
"What are you doin'’?"

16:51.034 --> 16:52.689
He said-- He just kept drivin'’.

16:52.724 --> 16:55.517
Kept-- Yeah.
-Okay. So, soon as I
turned around,

16:55.551 --> 16:57.758
he hammered on it,
-Yeah.

16:57.793 --> 16:59.931
-Okay.
Why did you assume
he was doin'’ that?

16:59.965 --> 17:04.344
-I don'’t know.
I think-- I think he told me
that he has warrants

17:04.379 --> 17:07.344
in Colville or somethin'’.
-Did he say that while
he was drivin'’ fast?

17:07.379 --> 17:10.586
-No, the-- um, I-- I met him
not too long ago.

17:10.620 --> 17:13.137
And when I met him,
that'’s what he said to me.
-Okay.

17:13.172 --> 17:15.448
When did-- When did
you see the lights turn on?

17:15.482 --> 17:17.172
-I just--
-When did you know
you were being chased

17:17.206 --> 17:20.172
by the police?
-Oh, I knew-- I knew
the minute you guys

17:20.206 --> 17:21.448
busted a U-turn
behind us.

17:21.482 --> 17:23.620
-Okay.
But you-- But you asked him
what he was doing?

17:23.655 --> 17:25.344
Did you say you
weren'’t okay with what
he was doing?

17:25.379 --> 17:27.620
-Yeah, I told him that.
-And he didn'’t care,
he didn'’t say anything?

17:27.655 --> 17:29.586
-No, he just kept driving.
-Did you tell him to slow down?

17:29.620 --> 17:30.965
-Yeah, I did...
-Did you tell him to stop?

17:31.000 --> 17:32.655
-I said, "Stop, stop." I did.
I really did.

17:32.689 --> 17:34.275
-Did you tell him
to let you out?

17:34.310 --> 17:36.655
-Yeah, I was going to,
but then he stopped right here,
and he jumped out.

17:36.689 --> 17:39.172
-Okay.
All right, miss, I appreciate
you talking with me.

17:39.206 --> 17:41.103
Give us-- Give us
just a minute.

17:41.137 --> 17:42.482
-Well, he says this is him.

17:42.517 --> 17:44.103
Just kinda looks like him.

17:44.137 --> 17:45.655
Checking right now.

17:45.689 --> 17:47.344
-Felony in Stevens County?

17:48.482 --> 17:50.103
For attempt to elude, weird.

17:50.137 --> 17:53.724
Well, guess what?
He'’s goin' for it again.

17:53.758 --> 17:56.793
Okay.
So we got a little bit more
of the story, man.

17:56.827 --> 17:58.793
You do have a warrant.
I know you knew you had it.

17:58.827 --> 18:00.068
You told me,
you were upfront about it.

18:00.103 --> 18:03.655
Y-- Your warrant'’s
for attempt to elude, right?

18:03.689 --> 18:06.586
Runnin'’ from the police?
-Yeah, I was really drunk
that night.

18:06.620 --> 18:08.482
-Yeah.
So you got a little bit
of a history of runnin'’

18:08.517 --> 18:11.275
from the cops.
And you know you have
a warrant, and I happened

18:11.310 --> 18:14.517
to turn on you...
and the other part
of this is,

18:14.551 --> 18:17.655
your passenger,
who was scared
out of her mind,

18:17.689 --> 18:20.689
is tellin'’ you to stop,
slow down, "What are you doing?"

18:20.724 --> 18:23.344
-I didn'’t hear her
say that once.
-Oh, baloney,

18:23.379 --> 18:25.448
she'’s sittin'
right next to you in the car...
-You can'’t tell me

18:25.482 --> 18:27.517
what I-- what I hear
and what I don'’t hear.

18:27.551 --> 18:29.275
-So were you so focused
on trying to get away
from me

18:29.310 --> 18:31.413
that you had tunnel vision,
you couldn'’t hear
what she was saying?

18:31.448 --> 18:33.275
-No, man, by the time
I hit this driveway right here,

18:33.310 --> 18:34.827
that'’s when I noticed
your lights, okay?

18:34.862 --> 18:36.896
And I did try
to get back here.

18:36.931 --> 18:38.655
So maybe I don'’t
lose my tools in my truck.

18:38.689 --> 18:39.965
-Okay.
-That'’s all I have.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.551
-So you were trying
to get away from me, then.

18:41.586 --> 18:43.758
You were trying to
get to the point where--
-I was trying to get...

18:43.793 --> 18:45.517
-I couldn'’t get you.
-...where I could put my truck.

18:45.551 --> 18:47.310
No.
-You wanted to-- Oh, you wanted
to get to a spot

18:47.344 --> 18:49.758
so I couldn'’t tow your truck.

18:49.793 --> 18:51.068
-Yes, sir.
-Ohh-kay.

18:51.103 --> 18:53.068
That'’s makin' more sense.

18:53.103 --> 18:54.965
So the truck'’s not yours,
the plates don'’t belong to it.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.517
-Well, I own the truck.
-You got a warrant,
you don'’t want the truck towed,

18:58.551 --> 19:00.758
so you'’re tryin'
to get a-- so you'’re tryin'
to get away from me

19:00.793 --> 19:02.724
so the truck don'’t get towed,
and you don'’t go to jail.

19:02.758 --> 19:06.000
-And no, I wasn'’t
trying to outrun you.
That'’s impossible.

19:06.034 --> 19:08.448
-I think you did
a pretty good job of trying
to get away from me initially

19:08.482 --> 19:10.758
and then realized
it wasn'’t gonna happen.

19:10.793 --> 19:13.137
So, went to the next best route.

19:13.172 --> 19:15.103
All right, man.
Becca wants to talk
to you real quick.

19:15.137 --> 19:17.310
-Huh?
-I'’m sorry, I love you.

19:17.344 --> 19:19.758
-Okay.
-I'’m probably gonna
get another felony,

19:19.793 --> 19:22.413
so I'’ll call you
when I get to booking.
-Okay.

19:22.448 --> 19:25.689
Can I give her a kiss, sir?
-What'’s that?

19:25.724 --> 19:28.103
-Can I give her a kiss?
-That'’s up to her.

19:28.137 --> 19:30.413
-Will you?
-Um, sure.

19:30.448 --> 19:33.172
-Thank you.
Love you, bye.

19:33.206 --> 19:34.206
-All right.
-Bye.

19:34.241 --> 19:35.965
-Is there anything
you wanna say to me?

19:36.000 --> 19:38.517
-No.
Uh, I...

19:38.551 --> 19:41.172
-Maybe don'’t drive
like that when you'’re
in the passenger seat?

19:41.206 --> 19:43.379
-Yeah, next time
don'’t do that.
You know?

19:43.413 --> 19:45.655
-Sorry. Maybe some day
I'’ll quit being an idiot.

19:45.689 --> 19:48.344
-Why put a girl
you love'’s life
in danger, right?

19:50.000 --> 19:52.172
-132 and Bush,
I'’ve got him at gunpoint.

19:52.206 --> 19:54.137
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.172 --> 19:55.310
Cover is code three.

19:55.344 --> 19:58.275
-[overlapping

20:04.206 --> 20:06.172
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'’ll still send
a code three.
