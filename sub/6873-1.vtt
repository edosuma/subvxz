WEBVTT

02:54.508 --> 02:56.135
What do you want?

02:56.426 --> 02:58.224
It's me.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.512
<i>Mervs' mate.</i>

02:59.721 --> 03:01.314
He's not here.

03:01.598 --> 03:04.317
Can I come in anyway?

03:04.601 --> 03:05.681
I've got something for you.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.995
You're prettier than
he let on, missus.

03:15.278 --> 03:16.325
Yeah?

03:16.613 --> 03:17.990
I haven't been well.

03:18.281 --> 03:19.281
Aw, that's a shame.

03:23.245 --> 03:24.497
Here.

03:24.788 --> 03:27.883
Let me do that for you.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.635
Why don't you go and grab
us a couple of glasses?

03:30.919 --> 03:33.638
Hm?

03:33.922 --> 03:35.640
What?

03:35.924 --> 03:39.224
I'm not going to nick anything.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.153
The boy said he'd be around.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.114
You haven't heard
from him, have you'?

03:54.401 --> 03:55.994
No.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.246
Never one for
keeping up, that one.

03:58.530 --> 04:02.535
Just like his dad and granddad.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.669
All the men in this family.

04:04.953 --> 04:05.545
Bloody useless!

04:05.829 --> 04:08.582
What are you doing?

04:08.874 --> 04:09.874
What?

04:20.051 --> 04:21.303
Here.

04:21.595 --> 04:24.098
Why don't we go and
have those outside, eh?

04:24.389 --> 04:25.936
It's a miracle day.

04:46.369 --> 04:48.417
So Mervs, did you talk to Kev?

04:48.705 --> 04:49.957
Yeah.

04:50.248 --> 04:51.350
He said he's already got
another apprentice on, so...

04:51.374 --> 04:52.796
Uh huh.

04:53.084 --> 04:54.854
He said maybe give him a call
back at the end of the year.

04:54.878 --> 04:58.678
Well, then why
don't I call him'?

04:58.965 --> 05:00.342
Thanks, Mister McGrath.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.834
Hey, young people have a hard
enough time getting ahead.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.939
And if I can help you,
or Paula out, I will.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.060
It's all lies.

05:11.269 --> 05:14.489
I was a perfect child.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.901
Marriage is about dependability.

05:17.192 --> 05:20.116
Knowing you can rely on
it when you need it most.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.452
To have constancy,
trust in another person,

05:23.740 --> 05:27.870
to truly know that
person, well, that to me,

05:28.161 --> 05:31.381
is the mark of true love.

05:31.665 --> 05:38.423
So to my darling wife,
Thea, happy 30 dependable,

05:38.713 --> 05:42.013
reliable years, love.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.348
30 years!

05:44.636 --> 05:45.636
Cheers!

05:55.897 --> 05:58.821
I'm dying of jealously here.

05:59.109 --> 06:00.531
Where did you get him again?

06:00.819 --> 06:02.617
One, two- ...

06:02.904 --> 06:03.944
When he fell from the sky.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.577
Three, four!

06:05.866 --> 06:07.539
All right, Nicolas is it!

06:07.826 --> 06:10.124
Doesn't have
a mate, does he?

06:49.034 --> 06:51.082
So when's that plumber coming?

06:51.369 --> 06:52.409
It's not too early, is it?

06:52.454 --> 06:56.175
I cancelled until pay day.

06:56.458 --> 06:57.755
But mom and dad said...

06:58.043 --> 07:00.163
I don't want to take any
more money from your parents.

07:00.378 --> 07:03.723
We'll be all right
for a couple of days.

07:04.007 --> 07:06.851
OK, Mister stand
on his own two feet.

07:12.515 --> 07:15.769
Come and get me.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.496
So lucky.

07:34.788 --> 07:35.289
Yeah.

07:35.580 --> 07:36.580
I'll fucking say.

07:47.634 --> 07:48.726
Wait a minute.

07:49.010 --> 07:49.351
Why?

07:49.636 --> 07:50.728
Hey!

07:51.012 --> 07:52.012
Wait!

08:09.948 --> 08:12.246
Are we really going to do this?

08:12.534 --> 08:13.534
Do you still want to?

08:52.866 --> 08:55.369
You'll be the oldest
apprentice in history, mate.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.083
Little kids will
throw stones at you.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.131
I'll still be looking
younger than you, mate.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.341
And how could you leave
this place, anyway?

09:02.625 --> 09:03.296
Lords.

09:03.585 --> 09:04.928
Old fashioned charm.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.259
Just watch me, mate.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.345
Farrell, visitor!

09:09.632 --> 09:11.509
What's she look like?

09:11.968 --> 09:12.968
Knock out.

09:15.680 --> 09:16.680
Fuck me!

09:16.890 --> 09:17.516
Hi!

09:17.807 --> 09:18.933
Hiya!

09:19.225 --> 09:19.646
All right, easy!

09:19.934 --> 09:20.275
Easy!

09:20.560 --> 09:21.560
Easy!

09:21.603 --> 09:22.603
Look at you!

09:22.645 --> 09:24.488
You've gone all skinny!

09:24.773 --> 09:25.490
What about you?

09:25.774 --> 09:26.894
What's happened to your lip?

09:27.108 --> 09:28.530
You hiding from somebody?

09:28.818 --> 09:29.818
Ah.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.784
Could ask the same
about you, mate.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.073
Farrell?

09:33.364 --> 09:34.364
Yeah?

09:34.407 --> 09:35.078
Have you fixed that fence yet?

09:35.366 --> 09:36.618
Oh, no.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.137
We're going to finish it
off tomorrow morning, boss.

09:38.161 --> 09:39.430
Well, you've
said your hellos.

09:39.454 --> 09:42.583
Come on, let's go!

09:42.874 --> 09:44.000
Sorry, mate.

09:44.292 --> 09:45.895
I'm on strike two with
this prick already, so...

09:45.919 --> 09:46.590
Yeah, right.

09:46.878 --> 09:48.175
Maybe a drink later then?

09:48.463 --> 09:49.635
Yeah.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.650
Well, don't
sound too thrilled, mate.

09:51.674 --> 09:52.345
No, no.

09:52.634 --> 09:54.056
I am.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.312
It's... thinking the
Rolls down on the corner,

09:56.596 --> 09:58.314
I want to meet you there.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.598
All right.

10:25.542 --> 10:26.542
Oi!

10:31.589 --> 10:32.681
Hey.

10:32.966 --> 10:33.966
Hi.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.766
Don't get pissed
off on me again.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.413
Looks like
everything's closing up.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.155
We'll just have to
take me to your joint.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.024
Oh, man, I've... I've...

10:42.308 --> 10:44.231
You haven't tied it up, eh?

10:44.519 --> 10:47.193
If I'd known.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.823
Eh?

10:49.107 --> 10:50.960
I found out where you worked
in about 10 minutes flat,

10:50.984 --> 10:53.203
didn't I?

10:53.486 --> 10:54.486
So be nice.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.177
Show me this little
hideout of yours.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.588
What are you up to, eh?

11:07.876 --> 11:10.880
Mervin Farrell doesn't
make rooms for a living.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.798
It's just temporary.

11:13.089 --> 11:17.139
I'm going into an
apprenticeship.

11:17.427 --> 11:18.428
Cabinet making.

11:18.845 --> 11:19.845
Bullshit.

11:24.142 --> 11:27.646
Don't you worry, I'll get
your little secret out of you.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.276
So this your hideout, eh?

12:15.693 --> 12:16.910
No way.

12:17.487 --> 12:18.487
Yours?

12:21.115 --> 12:22.708
Fuck me.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.164
Your own house.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.001
Christ!

12:31.292 --> 12:33.340
You've even got veggies!

12:33.628 --> 12:35.596
Just a bit of silver beet.

12:35.880 --> 12:36.551
Silver beet.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.386
Zucchini.

12:38.675 --> 12:39.767
Tomatoes.

12:40.051 --> 12:41.678
Thyme.

12:41.970 --> 12:46.441
Didn't know if it
would work, but-

12:48.476 --> 12:50.649
It's magic.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.065
Fucking magic.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.208
Very nice.

13:17.505 --> 13:18.505
You fixing it up?

13:19.007 --> 13:20.350
Yeah, as much as I can.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.556
What about the tour?

13:26.848 --> 13:27.848
An first.

14:03.885 --> 14:05.853
You making jams now, as well?

14:06.137 --> 14:07.137
It's housewarming.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.899
You've developed a
taste for quince, I see.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.655
Not really.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.155
You're a shit load older.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.466
You're not drinking?

14:35.792 --> 14:36.792
No.

14:41.089 --> 14:43.763
All right then.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.050
Cheers then.

14:47.845 --> 14:50.894
Listen, I'm really... I'm
really sorry that all this...

14:51.182 --> 14:52.182
The hot and cold?

14:52.225 --> 14:53.225
Yeah.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.547
I didn't even know you were out.

14:59.524 --> 15:02.027
What's that matter?

15:02.318 --> 15:03.911
Hm?

15:04.195 --> 15:05.868
<i>Merv?</i>

15:06.906 --> 15:07.906
Coming!

15:10.827 --> 15:12.295
You're early.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.421
So we have the whole afternoon.

15:14.705 --> 15:20.803
Um... this is my mate
from Sydney, Jim Stewart.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.464
Hello.

15:22.755 --> 15:23.881
Um, Paula.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.269
So this is the big secret, eh?

15:32.890 --> 15:33.890
Worth the surprise, mate.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.436
Worth the surprise.

15:43.151 --> 15:44.151
Good day, Paula.

15:46.446 --> 15:51.828
I'm Jim, but you
can call me Pommie.

15:53.244 --> 15:54.244
Hello.

16:10.303 --> 16:14.524
You've done real well for
yourself, young Sparra.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.105
Real well.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.393
Paula's dad found it.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.567
Put a deposit on it.

16:20.855 --> 16:22.823
Smart play, kid.

16:23.107 --> 16:23.653
Smart.

16:23.941 --> 16:25.067
It's not like that.

16:25.359 --> 16:26.359
Sure it's not.

16:30.948 --> 16:35.169
Now look, some of the boys
have got a job on now.

16:35.453 --> 16:37.626
I'm clean now.

16:37.914 --> 16:38.914
You fucking serious?

16:42.376 --> 16:45.095
Look, I can help you out
with anything you need.

16:45.379 --> 16:46.379
Hotel, or anything.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.177
That's real fucking
generous of you, mate.

16:55.306 --> 16:57.058
Where's your lady friend?

16:57.350 --> 16:59.193
Leave her out of it.

16:59.477 --> 17:01.400
I just wanted to thank
her for her hospitality.

17:01.979 --> 17:02.979
Pommie!

17:06.901 --> 17:07.901
Shit.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.957
You always this slow'?

17:13.241 --> 17:14.458
Well, it's normally just me.

17:14.742 --> 17:15.914
I can go at my own pace.

17:19.914 --> 17:20.914
Heya.

17:28.422 --> 17:29.014
Sit down, mate.

17:29.298 --> 17:30.845
You're the guest.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.636
Now that's exactly
why I should do my bit.

17:33.928 --> 17:36.807
You've forgotten your fucking
manners, young Sparra.

17:37.098 --> 17:38.098
I'm sorry, darling.

17:38.349 --> 17:39.020
No, no.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.231
I've heard worse.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.025
You can take over, if you want?

17:44.397 --> 17:45.397
Yeah.

17:49.777 --> 17:53.156
So James, I didn't ask, is there

17:53.447 --> 17:56.542
anyone special in your life?

17:56.826 --> 17:57.873
Is she always this noisy?

17:58.160 --> 18:00.379
Well, I was just asking.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.165
I'm just teasing.

18:02.456 --> 18:05.050
There's no one.

18:05.334 --> 18:06.802
I reckon I should fall in love.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.965
Look at what it's done
for this bloke, eh?

18:10.256 --> 18:12.930
He's a charmer, isn't he?

18:13.217 --> 18:14.217
Oi.

18:14.260 --> 18:14.806
Come on, let's get out of her.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.767
Go and get a beer.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.337
Well, where should we take him?

18:24.562 --> 18:27.691
Suppose anywhere that we
can find pretty young ladies

18:27.982 --> 18:28.983
like you, eh?

18:29.400 --> 18:30.400
Hm.

19:12.610 --> 19:13.953
There she is.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.658
She's my best friend.

19:15.946 --> 19:17.789
She's made plans for us tonight.

19:18.366 --> 19:19.366
Hi.

19:23.079 --> 19:26.504
Yvonne, this is James.

19:26.791 --> 19:27.462
Hello, Yvonne.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.172
Oh, hi.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.384
You have enough room, or do
you need me to wriggle over?

19:32.672 --> 19:33.992
That sounds
like an offer.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.267
Let's just see how
we get on first, huh?

19:42.390 --> 19:43.391
Oh, Paula.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.003
I was at Lolly
Point this morning.

19:45.226 --> 19:46.411
They have the cutest little
reception hall there.

19:46.435 --> 19:47.482
Yvonne!

19:47.770 --> 19:50.774
If you're not getting
excited, I will!

19:51.065 --> 19:52.585
Getting married on
me already, darling?

19:52.733 --> 19:53.733
No, silly.

19:58.030 --> 20:01.330
Oh, congratulations,
you sly bugger, eh!

20:01.617 --> 20:03.857
Off the market before I had
the chance to steal her away.

20:07.498 --> 20:08.498
No offense, sweetheart.

20:38.446 --> 20:39.493
Come on, Yvonne.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.123
In a hurry, Jim?

20:41.407 --> 20:44.377
You have no idea, darling.

20:44.660 --> 20:45.832
You know, Yvonne.

20:46.120 --> 20:47.320
She can't keep her mouth shut.

20:47.538 --> 20:48.538
No, she can't.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.113
Thursday nights are
very interesting at this place.

20:55.296 --> 20:57.924
Full of interesting types.

20:58.215 --> 20:58.886
All right.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.267
I'll fit right in then.

21:00.551 --> 21:01.268
Hey, Wayne.

21:01.552 --> 21:02.223
Hey, Yvonne.

21:02.511 --> 21:03.511
Brought some friends.

21:03.804 --> 21:04.804
Sure.

21:10.895 --> 21:11.895
Excuse me.

21:11.979 --> 21:15.199
Sorry, darling.

21:15.483 --> 21:17.201
I told you!

21:17.485 --> 21:18.953
Looks like those
two are getting on.

21:19.361 --> 21:20.361
Yeah.

22:52.496 --> 22:55.841
Oh, welcome to Thursday
night at Blades.

22:56.125 --> 22:59.345
Happy night, if you
know what I mean.

22:59.628 --> 23:02.177
Oh, do we have anyone
from out of town tonight?

23:02.464 --> 23:02.930
Over here!

23:03.215 --> 23:03.761
Oh!

23:04.049 --> 23:05.596
Where from, sweetie?

23:05.885 --> 23:06.885
From Sydney.

23:07.136 --> 23:07.637
Ah.

23:07.928 --> 23:10.351
Sin City, is it?

23:10.639 --> 23:12.141
Ah!

23:12.433 --> 23:14.652
Well, that is some haircut.

23:14.935 --> 23:17.063
When did you get out?

23:17.354 --> 23:18.571
Oh, I'm just joking.

23:18.856 --> 23:21.985
Can't a girl make a joke?

23:22.276 --> 23:26.247
So what's your name, soldier?

23:26.530 --> 23:27.247
James.

23:27.531 --> 23:28.657
Well, James.

23:28.949 --> 23:36.299
Big Jim, you in town for
business, or pleasure?

23:36.582 --> 23:37.708
Wait.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.172
Don't tell me.

23:39.460 --> 23:43.055
I can feel a bit of
your pleasure right now!

23:45.299 --> 23:47.017
Some ice for the young man!

24:09.448 --> 24:10.495
We had a plan, eh!

24:10.783 --> 24:11.823
I told you, I'm clean now.

24:11.909 --> 24:12.330
No!

24:12.618 --> 24:13.618
We had a plan!

24:13.744 --> 24:14.961
All right?

24:15.245 --> 24:17.213
And it was you and me,
not you, and me, and her,

24:17.498 --> 24:20.217
and a fucking house, and
your fucking broomsticks!

24:20.501 --> 24:21.718
Count me out now.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.002
No!

24:23.212 --> 24:26.011
You made me a promise!

24:26.298 --> 24:28.266
It was another life.

24:28.550 --> 24:29.767
Eh?

24:30.886 --> 24:31.603
What are you doing?

24:31.887 --> 24:33.007
Get out of my way, princess!

24:54.910 --> 24:56.207
Hey!

24:56.495 --> 24:56.836
Hey.

24:57.121 --> 24:57.713
Is he OK?

24:57.997 --> 24:58.372
Yeah, yeah.

24:58.664 --> 24:59.165
He's fine.

24:59.456 --> 25:00.456
Well, where is he?

25:04.378 --> 25:05.378
Just stay.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.504
Just stay.

25:20.853 --> 25:21.853
Here.

25:21.937 --> 25:23.154
What have you done?

25:23.439 --> 25:25.157
I've only got about 30 seconds.

25:25.441 --> 25:28.160
Come on!

25:28.444 --> 25:29.161
<i>Hey, missus.</i>

25:29.445 --> 25:30.662
We're all right to push off?

25:30.946 --> 25:32.448
Hey, Pom's not
feeling very well,

25:32.740 --> 25:33.115
do you mind if we head off?

25:33.407 --> 25:33.748
Come on.

25:34.033 --> 25:34.374
But what about Yvonne?

25:34.658 --> 25:34.999
Please?

25:35.284 --> 25:35.625
Please?

25:35.909 --> 25:36.909
OK.

25:48.797 --> 25:52.097
Bye, then.

26:15.783 --> 26:17.063
What the
fuck did you do?

26:17.326 --> 26:18.446
What's it look like?

26:18.702 --> 26:19.702
Are you insane?

26:19.787 --> 26:20.787
They know Yvonne.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.297
Did you forget how easy it is?

26:22.581 --> 26:23.581
Beats making broomsticks.

26:27.127 --> 26:29.505
I want you gone.

26:29.797 --> 26:30.218
No, you don't.

26:30.506 --> 26:32.179
Yeah, I do.

26:32.466 --> 26:34.810
I'm not coming back
inside for your shit.

26:35.094 --> 26:38.815
Go, or I'll make you.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.520
You can try, young Sparra.

26:43.727 --> 26:44.944
Oh, sorry.

26:45.229 --> 26:46.989
Just seeing if you had
everything you needed.

26:47.189 --> 26:47.610
Yeah.

26:47.898 --> 26:49.445
You're right.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.076
Mind that , missus.

26:51.360 --> 26:51.952
Yeah.

26:52.236 --> 26:53.236
Thanks.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.031
Thanks!

27:03.831 --> 27:06.835
What's going on, Merv?

27:07.126 --> 27:08.646
You never mentioned
him before tonight,

27:08.794 --> 27:11.843
suddenly he's in our house,
he's sleeping five feet away

27:12.131 --> 27:13.131
from us.

27:13.257 --> 27:14.600
Who is he?

27:14.883 --> 27:17.853
Pommie thinks we're a lot
closer than we actually are.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.481
There's nothing more to know.

27:20.764 --> 27:21.764
Yeah, there never is.

27:22.015 --> 27:22.686
Oh, come on!

27:22.975 --> 27:23.975
No, it's true, Merv.

27:24.059 --> 27:25.259
You never talk about anything.

27:25.352 --> 27:26.712
Your friends, your
family, nothing.

27:26.937 --> 27:27.937
OK.

27:30.023 --> 27:31.070
Like right now.

27:31.358 --> 27:32.358
Just leave it, all right?

27:39.741 --> 27:40.741
Paula!

28:12.608 --> 28:14.360
Shit head!

28:47.935 --> 28:48.276
Hey!

28:48.560 --> 28:50.312
Hey!

28:50.604 --> 28:53.323
I'm going for a quick
beer, you up for it?

28:53.607 --> 28:55.029
Oh, I've got to
sort something out.

28:55.317 --> 28:56.317
Right.

28:56.360 --> 28:57.560
I'll see you after lunch then.

29:13.377 --> 29:14.674
Ben around?

29:14.962 --> 29:15.962
Beer garden.

29:24.346 --> 29:25.346
You Ben?

29:32.813 --> 29:35.407
Don't need a broom, mate.

29:35.691 --> 29:36.943
He was rude, don't you think?

29:37.234 --> 29:39.453
Well, Merv said he was
having a rough nice.

29:39.736 --> 29:40.862
No excuse.

29:41.154 --> 29:42.874
I thought he was supposed
to be a gentleman.

29:43.156 --> 29:45.204
You took him to see
drag queens, Yvonne.

29:45.492 --> 29:49.247
If they can't cope
with my world- ...

29:53.375 --> 29:57.551
Actually, do you mind if I
pop home, see how he's going?

29:57.838 --> 29:58.259
Run along.

29:58.547 --> 29:59.924
I can finish up.

30:00.215 --> 30:03.094
Thank you.

30:03.385 --> 30:06.355
Tell me if he talks
about me, will you?

30:20.944 --> 30:23.618
Wolf Bailey reckons
you're a good bloke.

30:23.905 --> 30:30.834
Says you might be able a man
acquire a hard to come by item.

30:31.121 --> 30:33.215
Don't know him.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.000
You heard of a wolf?

30:35.292 --> 30:36.292
I know a few dogs.

30:39.713 --> 30:41.181
So can you help me?

30:41.631 --> 30:42.631
No.

31:09.826 --> 31:11.123
Oh, fuck it.

31:11.411 --> 31:12.691
Put that fucking
thing down, man.

31:16.041 --> 31:17.042
100.

31:17.334 --> 31:18.334
Upfront.

31:56.581 --> 31:57.581
Shouldn't have.

32:00.460 --> 32:01.757
Yeah.

32:02.045 --> 32:05.015
You know what they about
the devil and idle hands.

32:05.298 --> 32:10.771
Uh... I didn't know
where that lived.

32:11.054 --> 32:12.931
I've never seen it before.

32:13.473 --> 32:14.473
Hey.

32:22.274 --> 32:23.742
It's very kind of you.

32:24.025 --> 32:25.545
Ah, I just think it
was an.

32:42.627 --> 32:43.924
So how'd you two meet, anyway?

32:44.212 --> 32:45.589
I was visiting my
cousin in Sydney.

32:45.881 --> 32:47.724
She was the one
having the party.

32:48.008 --> 32:50.181
And Merv was there
and we just clicked.

32:50.469 --> 32:51.641
Talked all night.

32:51.928 --> 32:54.522
I mean, I did most
of the talking.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.434
He doesn't talk much, does he?

32:57.726 --> 33:04.655
Anyway, I was coming back here
the next day, so I thought...

33:05.525 --> 33:07.573
You thought?

33:07.861 --> 33:09.021
I thought nothing more of it.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.496
And a week later I
got a call from Merv

33:13.783 --> 33:16.411
asking me if I wanted to go out.

33:16.703 --> 33:17.795
Sneaky bugger.

33:18.079 --> 33:19.839
So he jumped a train
from Sydney to Melbourne

33:20.081 --> 33:21.361
to take you out for a pizza, eh?

33:21.583 --> 33:23.423
Sounds like you two got
something real special.

33:32.427 --> 33:32.768
OK.

33:33.053 --> 33:36.148
My turn.

33:36.431 --> 33:40.686
What happened last
night between you two?

33:40.977 --> 33:42.695
Come on, Paula.

33:42.979 --> 33:44.071
He's a mate.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.529
And I'm his fiancee.

33:46.816 --> 33:47.942
Then he should tell you.

33:48.235 --> 33:50.363
Well, he should.

33:50.654 --> 33:55.785
And it's unfair of
me to ask you, but...

33:57.410 --> 33:59.170
You're just not going
to give it up, are you?

33:59.412 --> 34:01.460
No.

34:01.748 --> 34:05.252
You know, I really am
starting to like you.

34:22.185 --> 34:23.185
Right.

34:26.606 --> 34:28.565
When Merv was young, he
got into a bit of trouble.

34:30.443 --> 34:31.683
He got in with the wrong crowd.

34:35.031 --> 34:36.031
He did a bit of time.

34:42.038 --> 34:43.335
Prison?

34:44.291 --> 34:45.291
Yeah.

34:51.172 --> 34:54.266
And that's how you met?

34:54.551 --> 34:57.100
Yeah.

34:57.387 --> 34:59.606
What did he do?

34:59.889 --> 35:01.516
Ah.

35:01.808 --> 35:04.687
Not much, you know.

35:04.978 --> 35:08.482
He nicked a car,
got into a fight.

35:08.773 --> 35:09.773
I can't even remember.

35:12.611 --> 35:17.617
Anyway, last night, I
told him to come clean.

35:17.907 --> 35:21.081
You're getting married,
you deserve to know.

35:21.369 --> 35:23.209
You're spending the rest
of your live with him.

35:36.051 --> 35:38.850
You all right'?

35:39.137 --> 35:40.137
Don't know.

35:45.769 --> 35:47.988
Come here.

35:48.271 --> 35:50.399
Sorry.

35:50.690 --> 35:52.250
I probably shouldn't
have told you, huh?

35:52.359 --> 35:55.829
No, I-I asked you, so-

36:03.703 --> 36:05.501
What's the hurry?

36:05.789 --> 36:07.006
Uh, need to get home.

36:12.212 --> 36:13.589
I'll catch you tomorrow?

36:13.880 --> 36:14.381
Yeah.

36:14.673 --> 36:15.970
See you tomorrow.

36:16.800 --> 36:17.800
Shit.

36:24.641 --> 36:25.938
Hey.

36:26.226 --> 36:28.854
We're going on a picnic.

36:29.145 --> 36:31.614
Got your medicine, mate.

36:31.898 --> 36:34.071
I'm not really in the mood.

36:34.359 --> 36:37.283
Get in you big sook.

36:37.570 --> 36:38.570
Come on.

36:50.792 --> 36:51.792
Hey.

36:54.754 --> 36:58.429
You know there's nothing
you can't tell me.

36:58.717 --> 36:59.934
What does that mean?

37:03.096 --> 37:04.696
I just don't want us
to have any secrets.

37:09.144 --> 37:10.396
Merv?

37:10.687 --> 37:11.939
I'm serious.

37:12.230 --> 37:15.325
I love you.

37:15.608 --> 37:17.281
I love you, too.

37:17.569 --> 37:18.161
Pommie!

37:18.445 --> 37:21.949
What are you doing?

37:22.240 --> 37:23.708
Getting some more beers.

37:23.992 --> 37:24.992
Come on.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.059
What'd you say to her?

38:26.513 --> 38:28.311
Did we
leave the lights on'?

38:28.598 --> 38:30.316
No.

38:30.600 --> 38:31.600
Oh, shit.

38:34.979 --> 38:35.979
What's happened?

38:45.490 --> 38:46.490
<i>Meme'?</i>

38:46.741 --> 38:48.101
Just wait here a
minute, all right?

39:38.334 --> 39:39.677
They're gone, whoever they were.

39:39.961 --> 39:41.087
Who would do this?

39:44.966 --> 39:46.806
I'll go out and see if
anyone's hanging around.

39:54.434 --> 39:55.731
It'll be all right.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.703
Fuck me.

40:09.991 --> 40:11.413
Didn't think they'd
come back at us.

40:11.701 --> 40:14.124
You robbed their club,
what do you expect?

40:14.787 --> 40:15.787
Eh?

40:18.291 --> 40:21.090
Fuck!

40:21.377 --> 40:23.300
All right, then.

40:23.588 --> 40:24.840
Let's go and fix it then.

40:25.131 --> 40:26.633
What do you mean?

40:26.925 --> 40:28.973
Well, what are you going to do?

40:29.260 --> 40:29.681
Call the cops?

40:29.969 --> 40:30.686
Oh, fuck you.

40:30.970 --> 40:33.644
You caused this, you fix it!

40:33.932 --> 40:36.981
Hang on a minute there, mate.

40:37.268 --> 40:39.191
You know these blokes.

40:39.479 --> 40:42.358
You've known them all your life.

40:42.649 --> 40:45.243
There's only one way
to deal with them.

40:45.526 --> 40:49.952
And if you don't,
they'll have you.

40:50.239 --> 40:52.559
You remember what that feels
like, don't you, young Sparra?

40:59.415 --> 41:02.464
Your pretty little
Paula in there'?

41:02.752 --> 41:05.096
She won't be safe in that house.

41:05.380 --> 41:06.927
She won't be safe in
that fucking town.

41:10.093 --> 41:14.599
And you know I'm
right, don't you.

41:14.889 --> 41:17.267
They're coming.

41:17.558 --> 41:18.838
They haven't taken
anything, they

41:18.977 --> 41:21.821
just... I'm calling the police.

41:22.105 --> 41:23.277
No, no, no.

41:23.564 --> 41:24.564
Why not?

41:27.443 --> 41:29.195
Can we just talk inside
for a sec, please?

41:42.709 --> 41:44.177
We can't call the police.

41:44.460 --> 41:45.460
Tell me why.

41:48.756 --> 41:49.756
Just say it!

41:54.012 --> 41:57.642
Because you were in prison.

41:57.932 --> 42:00.401
I've done my time.

42:00.685 --> 42:01.685
How much time?

42:06.774 --> 42:07.774
Four years.

42:10.695 --> 42:11.695
Four years?

42:15.033 --> 42:16.033
What did you do?

42:21.831 --> 42:24.209
Me and a mate got into a fight.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.218
We both got hurt.

42:26.502 --> 42:28.470
It was an accident.

42:28.755 --> 42:30.223
Why didn't you tell me?

42:36.804 --> 42:37.804
Knock, knock.

42:43.519 --> 42:45.738
I'm sorry, Paula.

42:46.022 --> 42:48.275
This is all my fault.
I reckon the guy

42:48.566 --> 42:50.526
that did this, me and him
shared a few harsh words

42:50.651 --> 42:52.745
the other night.

42:53.029 --> 42:54.497
Wayne.

42:54.781 --> 42:56.783
Yvonne's friend.

42:57.075 --> 42:58.748
That's how they knew
how to come here.

42:59.410 --> 43:00.410
Wayne?

43:02.789 --> 43:05.338
I reckon he was
jealous, or something.

43:05.625 --> 43:06.865
I could have handled it better.

43:10.046 --> 43:13.971
Anyway, I should go get on
and eat a piece of humble pie.

43:14.258 --> 43:17.762
And then we'll get back
and we'll fix this up.

43:18.054 --> 43:19.271
Good as new.

43:19.555 --> 43:22.104
Wait, why do you have to go?

43:22.391 --> 43:25.645
I'll probably start
cause more trouble.

43:31.359 --> 43:32.736
We Won't do anything stupid.

43:33.277 --> 43:34.277
No.

43:36.280 --> 43:37.280
Take me to Yvonne's.

44:41.179 --> 44:41.725
Oi.

44:42.013 --> 44:43.640
Give me the keys.

44:43.931 --> 44:44.931
Why?

44:45.183 --> 44:46.383
Just give me the fucking keys.

44:51.022 --> 44:52.319
What are you doing?

44:58.487 --> 44:59.989
You want to fix this, or not?

45:00.323 --> 45:01.323
Come on.

45:56.420 --> 45:57.420
That way.

46:41.716 --> 46:42.716
Wayne?

46:48.180 --> 46:49.181
Remember me?

46:49.473 --> 46:50.473
Fuck off!

46:50.516 --> 46:51.563
Hey, now.

46:51.851 --> 46:52.443
I thought we already
had that discussion

46:52.727 --> 46:53.728
about our manners, mate.

46:54.020 --> 46:55.020
You blokes, go to Sydney!

46:55.104 --> 46:56.104
We're protected.

46:59.400 --> 46:59.775
Hey!

47:00.067 --> 47:00.693
Hey!

47:00.985 --> 47:03.864
You're making a big mistake!

47:04.155 --> 47:07.250
Come here!

47:16.250 --> 47:17.467
We're square now, yeah?

47:17.752 --> 47:18.093
Yeah.

47:18.377 --> 47:19.469
Yeah.

47:19.754 --> 47:20.801
It's done?

47:21.130 --> 47:22.130
Yeah.

47:29.555 --> 47:30.555
What?

47:31.223 --> 47:32.725
Is that it?

47:39.940 --> 47:40.940
No, no.

47:43.652 --> 47:44.744
I fucking knew it!

47:51.202 --> 47:52.920
Wayne!

47:53.204 --> 47:54.204
Wayne!

47:54.246 --> 47:55.964
What are you guys doing here?

47:56.248 --> 47:58.125
Where's Bruce?

47:58.417 --> 47:58.918
Pom...

47:59.210 --> 48:00.462
Brucie's not here.

48:00.753 --> 48:01.753
Pommie, don't.

48:07.301 --> 48:08.301
Come on, Sparra.

48:45.714 --> 48:46.714
Come on.

50:10.049 --> 50:11.049
Hey.

50:16.597 --> 50:17.597
Listen, man, I know.

50:20.476 --> 50:22.774
Come here, come on.

50:28.943 --> 50:29.943
No.

50:30.027 --> 50:31.027
Come here.

51:12.278 --> 51:13.575
Where are you going?

51:13.862 --> 51:14.579
Come here!

51:14.863 --> 51:16.035
This isn't me anymore!

51:16.323 --> 51:16.994
Yes, it is!

51:17.283 --> 51:17.704
No!

51:17.992 --> 51:18.993
Come here!

51:19.743 --> 51:20.743
Sparra!

51:23.747 --> 51:24.747
Sparra!

51:24.790 --> 51:25.507
Come!

51:25.791 --> 51:26.917
Come here!

51:27.209 --> 51:28.436
If I see you again, I'll
call the cops myself.

51:28.460 --> 51:29.620
You wouldn't fucking do that.

51:29.712 --> 51:32.135
I mean it!

51:32.423 --> 51:34.141
I meant it, Pommie.

51:34.425 --> 51:36.803
I don't want this.

51:37.094 --> 51:38.767
What?

51:39.054 --> 51:40.476
What?

51:40.848 --> 51:41.269
Huh?

51:41.557 --> 51:42.557
Sparra!

52:25.601 --> 52:27.854
Hi, I need to see her.

52:28.145 --> 52:29.145
Come back in the morning.

52:29.229 --> 52:30.230
I can't wait.

52:30.522 --> 52:31.833
She'll find you when
she's ready, Merv.

52:31.857 --> 52:32.232
Please?

52:32.524 --> 52:33.524
Please?

52:33.567 --> 52:34.567
It's fine.

52:38.238 --> 52:39.238
Really.

53:18.529 --> 53:21.248
I told her we had a fight.

53:21.532 --> 53:22.532
Did We?

53:27.788 --> 53:29.756
You said there wasn't
going to be anymore trouble.

53:30.040 --> 53:31.758
No.

53:32.042 --> 53:33.402
There's always
going to be trouble.

53:45.347 --> 53:46.347
Look at me.

54:03.115 --> 54:06.415
I don't care.

54:06.702 --> 54:08.249
I don't care that
you went to prison.

54:11.415 --> 54:13.463
I only care that you lied to me.

54:19.131 --> 54:20.383
I was scared.

54:24.052 --> 54:29.559
I was... I was scared you were
going to look at me like you're

54:29.850 --> 54:30.850
looking at me right now.

55:06.595 --> 55:07.595
Looking for someone?

55:51.723 --> 55:53.646
Am I ugly?

55:53.934 --> 55:55.026
No, love.

55:55.310 --> 55:57.733
You're beautiful.

55:58.021 --> 56:01.116
You've been in the
wars, haven't you?

56:01.400 --> 56:02.400
But all that's over now.

56:05.279 --> 56:07.077
I'm tired.

56:07.364 --> 56:08.581
I'm just tired.

56:08.866 --> 56:09.866
There, there.

56:46.528 --> 56:47.825
You're OK.

56:48.113 --> 56:49.113
You're safe now.

57:00.876 --> 57:01.876
No!

57:10.886 --> 57:11.886
Hey, hey!

57:11.970 --> 57:13.187
Don't do that!

57:13.472 --> 57:15.645
Stay!

57:15.933 --> 57:16.650
Come here!

57:16.934 --> 57:18.151
Get off me!

57:18.435 --> 57:21.609
Just... get off!

57:22.898 --> 57:23.898
Come here!

58:04.147 --> 58:07.321
My dad had a temper.

58:07.609 --> 58:09.703
I spend most my growing
up years just trying

58:09.987 --> 58:12.365
to stay out of his way.

58:12.656 --> 58:14.624
And then one time,
he hit me so hard he

58:14.908 --> 58:18.037
broke my jaw in three places.

58:18.328 --> 58:22.333
It was just after
my ninth birthday.

58:22.624 --> 58:25.173
Mom packed me and my sister
in the car and left him.

58:28.755 --> 58:30.007
You have a sister?

58:33.593 --> 58:34.594
Yeah.

58:34.886 --> 58:35.886
In Perth.

58:42.477 --> 58:45.196
Let's go there.

58:45.480 --> 58:46.600
Just for a couple of months.

58:46.690 --> 58:50.695
Just until I figure
out what to do.

58:50.986 --> 58:52.586
I thought you'd sorted
things with Wayne.

58:52.779 --> 58:55.498
It's not Wayne, it's Pommie.

58:55.782 --> 58:59.662
He says I owe him
from prison days.

58:59.953 --> 59:01.000
How much do you owe him?

59:01.288 --> 59:03.006
Because maybe mom
and dad could...

59:03.290 --> 59:06.419
It's not money.

59:06.710 --> 59:09.133
He wants me to go
back to the way I was.

59:09.421 --> 59:11.264
You're not going to do that.

59:11.548 --> 59:13.266
No.

59:13.550 --> 59:17.100
But you don't know
what he's capable of.

59:17.387 --> 59:19.230
Maybe we should call the police?

59:19.514 --> 59:21.608
No police.

59:21.892 --> 59:23.485
I say we run.

59:23.769 --> 59:24.769
Just for now.

59:30.650 --> 59:31.902
It's going to be OK.

59:38.575 --> 59:39.747
Where are you going?

59:40.035 --> 59:41.127
Work.

59:41.411 --> 59:42.451
We're going to need money.

59:45.665 --> 59:46.865
Don't open the door to anyone.

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:07.112
You two are such animals.

01:00:07.395 --> 01:00:10.615
Honey, what's up?

01:00:10.899 --> 01:00:13.072
Do you mind if I
borrow your car?

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:34.616
Paula McGrath.

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:36.026
Yes?

01:01:36.318 --> 01:01:37.615
Police.

01:01:37.903 --> 01:01:39.075
Mind if we look around?

01:01:51.958 --> 01:01:54.928
Hey. Neil?

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:57.092
Paula and I are going to
go away for a few days.

01:01:57.214 --> 01:02:00.889
Can you cover for me?

01:02:01.176 --> 01:02:01.893
What?

01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:03.394
Boss wants a word.

01:02:24.366 --> 01:02:25.458
Knock, knock.

01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:33.959
Sorry for running off on you
the other night at.

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:37.095
Pretty women make me panic.

01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:38.671
See?

01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:43.017
Well, what do you want?

01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:46.805
Well, some water for
these would be a start.

01:02:57.107 --> 01:02:59.610
So where's your
boyfriend, Paula?

01:02:59.901 --> 01:03:01.528
I don't know.

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:03.663
Why are you looking for him?

01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:06.027
Merv Farrell and Jim Stewart
are wanted in connection

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:11.130
with an assault at Blades
Nightclub last night.

01:03:11.413 --> 01:03:13.916
You still don't
know where he is'?

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:15.754
Merv was with me last night.

01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:18.136
He was with you?

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:21.424
Seems our eye witness was lying.

01:03:21.715 --> 01:03:24.218
He was with me.

01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:28.559
Now as you don't seem to want
to find out who did this,

01:03:28.847 --> 01:03:29.847
I think you should leave.

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:40.033
I know your type, Paula.

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:42.445
You like the bad boys, eh?

01:03:42.736 --> 01:03:45.706
You don't know
anything about me.

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:47.866
Let me tell you a fact.

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:51.583
James Stewart is a
coldblooded killer.

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:56.341
Now if you see Stewart, or
your boyfriend, you ring me.

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:08.603
They call you
Sparra, don't they?

01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:09.345
Yeah.

01:04:09.637 --> 01:04:10.637
Why?

01:04:17.145 --> 01:04:18.237
Look.

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:19.613
That's a message for me.

01:04:19.898 --> 01:04:20.916
It's got nothing to do
with you, all right?

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:21.532
I'll clean it up...

01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:22.816
Clean out your locker!

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:23.405
I don't want to see you again.

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:24.785
I didn't do it, OK?

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:26.422
Why would I write my
own name on the wall?

01:04:26.446 --> 01:04:28.619
You know, you front
up, no resume, nothing.

01:04:28.907 --> 01:04:31.911
But I give you a shot
and how do you repay me?

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:33.545
You shit on my wall?

01:04:33.828 --> 01:04:34.920
I didn't do it!

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:35.671
Now get out of here
before I call the cops!

01:04:35.955 --> 01:04:36.330
Just listen!

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:37.169
Listen!

01:04:37.457 --> 01:04:37.832
Listen to me for a sec.

01:04:38.124 --> 01:04:39.125
Find Paula.

01:04:39.417 --> 01:04:39.758
I was with Paula all
night last night.

01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:41.043
Call her.

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:43.379
Police, please.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.017
Merv, Merv!

01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:54.478
I don't know what you
got yourself into, mate.

01:04:54.766 --> 01:04:56.484
Run.

01:04:56.768 --> 01:04:57.985
Just run.

01:04:58.269 --> 01:04:59.441
Merv Farrell?

01:05:00.188 --> 01:05:00.529
Hey!

01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:01.155
Hey!

01:05:01.439 --> 01:05:01.814
We just need a word!

01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:03.148
Grab him!

01:06:20.894 --> 01:06:23.613
Just like.

01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:24.897
Where's Yvonne?

01:06:31.779 --> 01:06:34.373
Pommie wants us all
to go out tonight.

01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:36.751
Said he has to promise
not to abandon me again.

01:06:37.035 --> 01:06:37.581
No.

01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:40.247
Don't worry, Yvonne.

01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:43.132
I can't anyway.

01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:44.838
I wouldn't mind a cup of tea.

01:06:45.126 --> 01:06:46.719
Well, you know
where the kitchen is.

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:52.341
OK.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:54.760
OK.

01:07:05.563 --> 01:07:08.066
You need to get out of here.

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:10.118
It's a little late for
that, don't you think?

01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:15.950
I know everything about you.

01:07:16.241 --> 01:07:17.834
Not everything, I bet.

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:21.620
Everything-

01:07:24.082 --> 01:07:25.122
And you're still with him?

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:34.763
Did he tell you that
I made him do it?

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:36.218
Hm?

01:07:38.304 --> 01:07:39.396
Because he came onto me.

01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:44.710
I hadn't even fucked a bloke
until he crawled up on my bunk.

01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:48.021
You're disgusting.

01:07:50.275 --> 01:07:53.654
So you don't know
everything, do you?

01:07:53.945 --> 01:07:56.164
I don't believe you.

01:07:56.447 --> 01:07:57.447
Yeah, you do.

01:08:01.703 --> 01:08:04.627
You knew there was something
different about him,

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:07.133
didn't you?

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:09.135
That something is me.

01:08:47.165 --> 01:08:48.917
Hey, we've got to go!

01:08:49.207 --> 01:08:49.629
What's wrong?

01:08:49.917 --> 01:08:50.462
Don't touch me.

01:08:50.752 --> 01:08:51.377
Hey...

01:08:51.711 --> 01:08:52.711
Don't.

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:00.010
What's wrong.

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:06.390
Did you fuck him?

01:09:09.854 --> 01:09:13.609
Did you fuck him?

01:09:13.899 --> 01:09:15.100
You understand what it's like.

01:09:15.276 --> 01:09:16.323
Listen, listen, listen.

01:09:16.611 --> 01:09:18.171
Young guys get bought
and sold in there.

01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:19.548
You don't... you don't... it's
not what you're thinking.

01:09:19.572 --> 01:09:21.050
It's... listen, listen,
listen, listen!

01:09:21.073 --> 01:09:21.620
Stop!

01:09:21.908 --> 01:09:22.908
It's not what you-

01:09:23.117 --> 01:09:24.437
Don't fucking
touch me ever again!

01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:24.917
Listen!

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:25.749
Don't!

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:27.129
Just listen to me first!

01:09:27.412 --> 01:09:29.086
Listen to me for a second!

01:09:29.374 --> 01:09:31.546
No!

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:34.508
Paula!

01:09:34.796 --> 01:09:36.969
Paula!

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:40.886
Let me explain!

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:42.349
Paula!

01:09:42.636 --> 01:09:43.636
I was going to tell you!

01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:54.156
Please!

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.238
Please!

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:57.859
Paula!

01:11:06.429 --> 01:11:07.429
Come here!

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:20.948
What are you going do, mate?

01:11:21.235 --> 01:11:23.738
You going to lie for
the rest of your life?

01:11:24.071 --> 01:11:25.071
Eh?

01:11:28.743 --> 01:11:30.416
I'm setting you free, Sparra.

01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:32.171
There you go.

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:33.455
Just like you did to me.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.317
Who takes another
man's prison mug'?

01:14:06.859 --> 01:14:07.859
Eh?

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:11.279
You cheap bastard.

01:14:34.095 --> 01:14:37.975
You know what we should do?

01:14:38.265 --> 01:14:42.896
What should we do, young Sparra?

01:14:43.187 --> 01:14:50.241
I saw you take the key from
the club, the key to the safe.

01:14:50.528 --> 01:14:53.048
No one would be stupid enough to
rob the same place three nights

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:54.280
in a row.

01:14:57.827 --> 01:14:58.867
You just tried to kill me.

01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:05.917
Yeah.

01:15:11.382 --> 01:15:12.382
Yeah.

01:15:15.386 --> 01:15:17.138
What do you reckon?

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:18.430
Feeling stupid?

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:24.352
Come here.

01:16:08.314 --> 01:16:08.689
Hey!

01:16:08.981 --> 01:16:10.233
Waiter!

01:16:10.524 --> 01:16:10.945
Oi!

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:11.608
Dickhead!

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:12.901
Bring us another.

01:16:15.696 --> 01:16:16.993
All right.

01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:18.281
down.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.538
I thought you wanted
him to remember us.

01:16:25.122 --> 01:16:26.122
Smart.

01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:32.546
Here you are, sir.

01:16:32.838 --> 01:16:33.509
It's about time.

01:16:33.798 --> 01:16:34.890
Thank you.

01:16:35.174 --> 01:16:36.894
Maybe you'd be more
comfortable at a smaller

01:16:37.009 --> 01:16:38.181
table near the back?

01:16:38.469 --> 01:16:39.789
What's that supposed
to some mean?

01:16:40.012 --> 01:16:40.478
All right.

01:16:40.763 --> 01:16:41.763
No, no.

01:16:41.806 --> 01:16:42.477
What's that supposed to mean?

01:16:42.765 --> 01:16:43.357
Sparra, it's a good idea.

01:16:43.641 --> 01:16:44.641
Let's go in the back.

01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:51.236
Excuse me, you
have to leave now.

01:16:51.524 --> 01:16:52.524
Sorry about that.

01:16:52.566 --> 01:16:53.237
He's had a bit much to drink.

01:16:53.526 --> 01:16:54.618
I'll get him home.

01:16:54.902 --> 01:16:55.902
Don't overdo it, mate.

01:16:56.153 --> 01:16:57.200
All right.

01:16:57.488 --> 01:16:59.536
I'm just going to go
and clean myself up.

01:16:59.824 --> 01:17:02.577
Here, I'll fix you
up for all that.

01:17:02.868 --> 01:17:03.494
You know what?

01:17:03.786 --> 01:17:05.504
Just take all that, mate.

01:17:40.281 --> 01:17:42.124
Paula?

01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:44.410
Paula?

01:17:44.702 --> 01:17:47.046
Look, I need you to know,
I'm going to get rid of him

01:17:47.538 --> 01:17:48.538
tonight.

01:17:50.708 --> 01:17:51.708
What are you going to do?

01:17:55.296 --> 01:17:56.296
I don't know.

01:17:56.422 --> 01:17:58.049
I'm making it up as I go along.

01:17:58.340 --> 01:17:59.500
We're going back to the club.

01:17:59.592 --> 01:18:02.766
Merv, please don't
do anything stupid.

01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:05.430
Merv?

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:17.734
Yeah, hello.

01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:19.027
I need the police.

01:18:30.998 --> 01:18:31.998
Sparra?

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:35.823
I thought you'd fallen in, mate.

01:18:36.045 --> 01:18:39.390
Sorry about that.

01:18:56.232 --> 01:18:58.109
Where are you going now?

01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.777
I need to see him.

01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:01.992
You can't just
forgive him, Paula.

01:19:02.279 --> 01:19:03.279
I haven't.

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:33.189
You looking for that, mate'?

01:19:33.477 --> 01:19:34.194
Yeah.

01:19:34.478 --> 01:19:34.979
I thought we might need it.

01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:36.271
I'll hold Onto it.

01:19:43.862 --> 01:19:44.862
Too fucking easy, boys.

01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:15.607
Reckon they'll show?

01:20:15.894 --> 01:20:18.568
I'm not taking any chances.

01:20:18.856 --> 01:20:19.856
This ends tonight.

01:20:44.256 --> 01:20:45.508
Fuck.

01:20:47.801 --> 01:20:49.519
Very fucking funny, mate.

01:20:49.803 --> 01:20:50.803
Open the door.

01:20:55.726 --> 01:20:57.524
Open the door, Sparra.

01:20:57.811 --> 01:21:00.985
I don't want to do this, Pom,
but you gave me no choice.

01:21:01.273 --> 01:21:02.490
What are you talking about?

01:21:02.775 --> 01:21:03.992
Open the door.

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:05.493
I'm sorry.

01:21:05.778 --> 01:21:08.998
I'm sorry.

01:21:09.281 --> 01:21:10.453
You fucking dick.

01:21:10.741 --> 01:21:11.162
Sparra!

01:21:14.244 --> 01:21:15.962
Sparra!

01:21:16.246 --> 01:21:17.246
Open the fucking door!

01:21:21.668 --> 01:21:23.466
He's got a fucking gun!

01:21:23.754 --> 01:21:24.846
He's got a fucking gun!

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:26.130
Call the cops!

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:35.561
Hi.

01:21:35.849 --> 01:21:36.849
Good day.

01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:39.441
Where in the hell are you going?

01:21:39.728 --> 01:21:40.900
What'd I just say?

01:21:41.188 --> 01:21:42.405
Merv!

01:21:42.689 --> 01:21:43.406
What are you doing?

01:21:43.690 --> 01:21:44.282
Get out of here.

01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:45.818
I was worried about you.

01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:47.110
I'm trying to fix things.

01:21:52.616 --> 01:21:54.869
They're in the office and
they've got guns this time.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.377
You leave this to us.

01:22:17.057 --> 01:22:18.229
Stewart!

01:22:18.517 --> 01:22:19.018
You're trapped!

01:22:19.309 --> 01:22:19.901
Fuck off!

01:22:20.185 --> 01:22:21.983
Throw out your weapons!

01:22:23.021 --> 01:22:24.021
Fuck!

01:22:35.534 --> 01:22:36.534
How do we get out?

01:22:39.746 --> 01:22:40.746
This way.

01:22:40.998 --> 01:22:41.998
Come on.

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:57.769
You're fucked,
Stewart, and you know it!

01:22:58.056 --> 01:22:59.273
Bring it on, you fuckers!

01:22:59.558 --> 01:23:00.558
Just got back up.

01:23:03.479 --> 01:23:06.733
Draw your weapons
out, or we open fire!

01:23:10.444 --> 01:23:11.444
Fuck you!

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:28.720
What was that?

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:30.722
Fire!

01:23:32.424 --> 01:23:32.765
Come on!

01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:33.471
Come on!

01:23:33.759 --> 01:23:34.100
Get out of the way!

01:23:34.384 --> 01:23:34.725
Go!

01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:35.351
Go!

01:23:35.636 --> 01:23:35.977
Go!

01:23:36.261 --> 01:23:37.261
Go!

01:23:56.365 --> 01:23:58.459
You fucking bitch!

01:23:59.326 --> 01:24:00.326
Fuck!

01:24:05.332 --> 01:24:07.630
They're down there!

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:12.220
Get the fuck up, or I'll
show you!

01:24:12.422 --> 01:24:13.093
Pom, listen!

01:24:13.382 --> 01:24:14.099
Listen!

01:24:14.383 --> 01:24:15.600
Pommie!

01:24:15.884 --> 01:24:16.884
They're in there.

01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:26.250
These blokes are
armed and dangerous,

01:24:26.395 --> 01:24:28.568
so take no bloody chances!

01:24:32.943 --> 01:24:36.538
There's no other
way out, Stewart!

01:24:36.822 --> 01:24:37.914
Tell them off.

01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:39.198
Shut up!

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:44.754
You started this!

01:24:45.038 --> 01:24:46.158
You crawled up onto my bunk!

01:24:46.373 --> 01:24:49.377
Do you remember that?

01:24:49.668 --> 01:24:51.136
You wanted me.

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:52.637
Four years, you were with me!

01:24:55.424 --> 01:24:57.267
Four years!

01:24:57.551 --> 01:24:59.178
Do you love me?

01:24:59.469 --> 01:25:01.062
Huh?

01:25:01.346 --> 01:25:03.895
Did you love me?

01:25:04.182 --> 01:25:06.605
You hated me.

01:25:07.603 --> 01:25:08.603
Yes.

01:25:27.039 --> 01:25:28.666
Of course, I loved you.

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:32.632
Of course, I did.

01:25:32.919 --> 01:25:40.019
You were everything,
but I'm with Paula now.

01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:42.521
I can have a life
with her, Pommie.

01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:44.977
You know I can.

01:25:45.265 --> 01:25:46.437
I love her.

01:25:50.604 --> 01:25:51.604
You fucking coward!

01:25:55.275 --> 01:25:56.755
Now I get to break
your...

01:25:57.736 --> 01:25:59.955
Get out of the way!

01:26:00.238 --> 01:26:01.410
Get out of the way.

01:26:01.698 --> 01:26:02.415
You have to kill me.

01:26:02.699 --> 01:26:04.701
Shut up!

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:06.210
You have to kill me.

01:26:06.495 --> 01:26:08.168
Shut the fuck up.

01:26:08.455 --> 01:26:09.455
Shut the fuck up.

01:26:12.334 --> 01:26:13.334
You'll never have me.

01:26:23.261 --> 01:26:24.261
You fucker!

01:26:24.346 --> 01:26:26.019
Turn around!

01:26:26.306 --> 01:26:28.525
You, get down there!

01:26:28.809 --> 01:26:29.526
Go on!

01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:31.483
Go on!

01:26:31.770 --> 01:26:32.770
You come with me.

01:26:37.984 --> 01:26:39.064
That's him!

01:26:39.194 --> 01:26:40.662
That's Stewart!

01:26:40.946 --> 01:26:43.007
I've got your fucking
informer right here

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:44.874
and I will shoot him!

01:26:45.158 --> 01:26:46.158
We give up!

01:26:46.326 --> 01:26:46.997
Put the gun down!

01:26:47.285 --> 01:26:49.834
We give up!

01:26:50.122 --> 01:26:50.793
Get back!

01:26:51.081 --> 01:26:51.752
Get back now!

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:52.757
here.

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:53.382
What do you want to do, Boss?

01:26:53.667 --> 01:26:54.793
Shit.

01:26:55.085 --> 01:26:57.179
Put the gun down, Jim.

01:26:57.462 --> 01:26:58.634
We won't hurt you.

01:27:00.382 --> 01:27:02.009
Fuck you.

01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:03.927
I'm going to blow
his fucking head off.

01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:07.268
I knew he was working
for you coppers!

01:27:07.556 --> 01:27:10.105
You and him set me up!

01:27:10.392 --> 01:27:12.486
What are you doing, Pom?

01:27:12.769 --> 01:27:13.895
What are you doing?

01:27:14.187 --> 01:27:15.187
They'll shoot you.

01:27:15.355 --> 01:27:16.355
Get down.

01:27:16.398 --> 01:27:17.991
Get down on your fucking knees!

01:27:18.275 --> 01:27:18.650
Don't shoot!

01:27:18.942 --> 01:27:19.317
Don't shoot!

01:27:19.609 --> 01:27:20.201
Don't shoot!

01:27:20.485 --> 01:27:21.156
It's not what you think.

01:27:21.445 --> 01:27:22.116
He's not going to hurt me!

01:27:22.404 --> 01:27:24.077
Put the gun down, Stewart!

01:27:24.364 --> 01:27:26.082
No fucking way!

01:27:26.366 --> 01:27:28.039
You don't have to do this!

01:27:28.326 --> 01:27:29.543
Don't look at me!

01:27:29.828 --> 01:27:31.501
Pommie, you don't
have to do this.

01:27:31.788 --> 01:27:33.961
I told you, I'm
going to set you free.

01:27:38.044 --> 01:27:39.044
Don't!

01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:57.256
Stop!

01:28:57.541 --> 01:29:00.044
Don't shoot!

01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:01.552
Get up, Merv.

01:29:04.756 --> 01:29:05.756
Stand up.

01:29:20.689 --> 01:29:21.986
Get them out of here.
