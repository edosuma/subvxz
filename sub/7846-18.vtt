19:23.395 --> 19:24.963
you can do more.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.401
You're right.
You've been right!

19:27.437 --> 19:28.737
Easy. Ow! Ah!

19:28.772 --> 19:30.073
That's my brain!

19:30.108 --> 19:32.278
[grunting] Whoa!

19:33.280 --> 19:35.017
[Huey groans] Aah!

19:36.119 --> 19:37.555
Ohh...

19:47.475 --> 19:50.379
The suit is not Gizmoduck.
You are.

19:50.414 --> 19:52.750
That's a Robotics badge
and a Philosophy Badge
right there.

19:52.785 --> 19:55.756
It's all me.
I'm in control.

19:55.791 --> 19:58.695
<i>Core meltdown in ten... nine...</i>

19:58.730 --> 20:01.100
<i>-eight...</i>
-Oh, no, I'm in control!

20:01.135 --> 20:03.606
Scatter!
This thing is gonna blow!

20:09.351 --> 20:10.519
[Bulby] <i> Goodbye.</i>

20:16.532 --> 20:18.467
[Huey]
Tonight we watched someone

20:18.502 --> 20:21.105
make the ultimate sacrifice
for this city.

20:21.140 --> 20:22.474
Despite the fact
that we doubted him,

20:22.509 --> 20:23.476
he was our hero.

20:23.511 --> 20:25.848
Hey! Get away
from my camera!

20:25.883 --> 20:28.420
[sirens]

20:28.455 --> 20:29.689
[groans]

20:29.725 --> 20:31.526
[groaning]

20:33.163 --> 20:34.699
[heart monitor beeping]

20:34.734 --> 20:35.700
M'Ma?

20:35.736 --> 20:37.503
<i>Pollito!</i>

20:37.538 --> 20:39.475
I think I was fired.

20:39.510 --> 20:41.511
I was definitely fired.

20:41.546 --> 20:43.148
Just rest right now.

20:43.183 --> 20:45.721
Someone sprung
for the VIP hospital suite.

20:45.756 --> 20:47.323
[Scrooge]
Need a word with you.

20:47.358 --> 20:48.391
Mr. McDuck?!

20:49.729 --> 20:51.565
Scrooge McDuck?

20:51.600 --> 20:53.368
Oh! I'll leave
you two alone.

20:54.739 --> 20:56.942
See if you can get money
out of it. He's loaded.

20:58.914 --> 21:00.348
[nervous laugh]

21:00.383 --> 21:03.020
You know, I spend
a lot of time abroad.

21:03.055 --> 21:05.091
I won't always be here
for Duckburg.

21:05.126 --> 21:07.329
I need someone to make sure

21:07.364 --> 21:10.935
this place is still standing
when I get back.

21:10.970 --> 21:11.972
Gyro?

21:15.446 --> 21:18.116
Mr. McDuck
was very impressed
by my hero armor.

21:18.151 --> 21:20.120
And he feels that,

21:20.155 --> 21:23.126
despite literally
every conceivable piece
of evidence to the contrary,

21:23.161 --> 21:26.466
you are the right person
to test the new model.

21:26.501 --> 21:27.735
The armor's self-contained,

21:27.770 --> 21:30.808
using your brain
as the core processor.

21:30.843 --> 21:32.610
[sighs] Go ahead.

21:32.645 --> 21:34.481
Blathering blatherskite?

21:35.752 --> 21:37.253
Ha ha ha! Ow ow!

21:37.288 --> 21:39.758
Too early! Ow ow!

21:39.793 --> 21:41.495
I think I need a new cast.

21:43.467 --> 21:44.836
Looking good, lad.

21:44.871 --> 21:46.271
You work for me now.

21:46.306 --> 21:48.843
I just need a name
to write on the paychecks.

21:48.878 --> 21:50.780
Call me...

21:50.815 --> 21:53.485
Gizmoduck!

21:53.520 --> 21:55.656
No-no-no-no-nooo!

21:55.691 --> 21:58.795
Nooo!
