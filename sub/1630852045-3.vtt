WEBVTT

00:06.131 --> 00:07.591
Okay. Are you ready?

00:10.135 --> 00:12.763
Repeat after me. I, Janie Gibbs…

00:12.846 --> 00:14.264
I, Janie Gibbs…

00:14.348 --> 00:18.060
…promise to never, ever, ever
attend dancing school.

00:18.143 --> 00:21.438
…promise to never, ever, ever
attend dancing school.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.524
I, Harriet…

00:23.607 --> 00:25.359
I got this. I wrote it.

00:25.442 --> 00:30.322
I, Harriet M. Welsch, promise to
never, ever, ever attend dancing school.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.951
You may now commence the handshake.

00:46.839 --> 00:47.840
Yeah.

00:49.132 --> 00:51.301
I hereby pronounce this oath sacred.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.179
There will be no attending of
dancing school.

00:54.263 --> 00:56.974
Never, ever, ever!

00:58.684 --> 00:59.685
Tag, you're it!

01:00.185 --> 01:02.604
Years ago, I came up with that oath

01:02.688 --> 01:06.108
to keep me and Janie from ever becoming
the "little ladies"

01:06.191 --> 01:07.985
our mothers wanted us to be.

01:10.529 --> 01:15.868
Since then, our mothers have tried
every tactic in the book to make us crack.

01:15.951 --> 01:17.369
The lecture.

01:17.452 --> 01:18.537
You're growing up,

01:18.620 --> 01:23.333
and part of that beautiful flowering is
learning how to dance.

01:25.002 --> 01:26.503
The guilt trip.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.046
Don't worry about me.

01:28.130 --> 01:30.465
I'll be fine being the only mother

01:30.549 --> 01:33.385
with a daughter who's a clump
on the dance floor.

01:34.928 --> 01:38.473
-The bribe.
-Who wants a puppy?

01:39.766 --> 01:41.518
The double team.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.854
This is how it's always been done.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.857
Young ladies go to dancing school.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.358
Never!

01:48.442 --> 01:51.653
For years,
that oath kept us fiercely united.

01:51.737 --> 01:55.157
It kept us free from itchy tights
and painful kitten heels,

01:55.240 --> 01:59.286
but this year it almost tore us apart.

02:00.412 --> 02:03.123
I just wanna be
You just wanna be

02:03.207 --> 02:04.917
We just wanna be

02:05.959 --> 02:08.461
I am gonna be who I wanna be

02:08.544 --> 02:10.464
My autonomy

02:10.547 --> 02:13.342
No, I won't cut my hair

02:13.425 --> 02:15.802
And I'll wear whatever

02:15.886 --> 02:21.892
I like it when I get to be myself

02:21.975 --> 02:24.728
I don't wanna be
You don't wanna be

02:24.811 --> 02:27.481
We don't wanna be told what to do

02:31.985 --> 02:37.115
It all began as I bit into my
2022nd consecutive

02:37.199 --> 02:39.117
tomato with mayonnaise sandwich.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.287
Oh, my, darling.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.961
This is so much fun.

02:50.045 --> 02:53.257
Harriet. I hope we aren't causing
too much of a ruckus.

02:53.340 --> 02:56.301
Your father and I are just
enjoying a little waltz.

02:56.385 --> 02:57.636
What a gas.

02:57.719 --> 03:00.889
-Care to join us?
-It's very easy to learn. You just--

03:00.973 --> 03:04.685
Uh-uh. I know where this is going.
And for the millionth time,

03:04.768 --> 03:07.813
I swore an oath
to never attend dancing school.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.023
It's not just dancing.

03:10.107 --> 03:13.068
There's manners and posture.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.821
I'm concerned about
the way you move, Harriet.

03:16.446 --> 03:19.032
Fast, that's the way I move. Fast.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.743
-And look at how you're dressed.
-So?

03:22.369 --> 03:25.414
People will think
I'm raising a ragamuffin.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.752
Sweetie, it really is fun.

03:30.836 --> 03:33.881
Or, at the very least,
nothing to make a fuss about.

03:33.964 --> 03:36.300
There's no getting around it this year.

03:45.225 --> 03:48.228
They always thought they were so cute.

03:56.486 --> 03:57.654
Dancing school?

03:58.864 --> 04:01.950
Please remind me once again
why it's the end of the world.

04:02.534 --> 04:05.746
Because I hate the little dresses
and tights and shoes.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.623
They make me feel undignified.

04:07.706 --> 04:10.125
And Saturday's prime spying time,

04:10.209 --> 04:12.753
and a spy would never
go to dancing school.

04:13.462 --> 04:14.963
But they would.

04:15.881 --> 04:18.425
Harriet, why are you a spy?

04:18.509 --> 04:19.801
To be a writer.

04:19.885 --> 04:24.056
Well, to be a writer you need to
see and know everything,

04:24.139 --> 04:25.807
including how to dance.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.977
I'd rather lick the floor.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.188
I feel so elegant.

04:33.774 --> 04:38.403
Look, you spend so much time and energy
fighting your mother on dancing school.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.906
Wouldn't it be easier to simply go?

04:40.989 --> 04:44.993
Who knows? If it's not a good fit,
you may not even have to go back.

04:51.166 --> 04:54.169
Wait, so you want to go to dancing school?

04:54.253 --> 04:55.754
Just one lesson.

04:56.588 --> 04:57.589
Hear me out.

04:58.382 --> 05:03.136
We'll go to class, you'll come up with
some genius plan to disrupt it.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.138
You are a mad scientist.

05:05.222 --> 05:06.974
I'm a scientist scientist.

05:07.933 --> 05:10.394
Sure. The point is we'll get kicked out,

05:10.477 --> 05:13.438
and the whole thing will be
such a flaming disaster

05:13.522 --> 05:16.608
that our moms will give up
on dancing school forever.

05:17.276 --> 05:21.613
So you'd like to add an unstable element,
say vinegar,

05:21.697 --> 05:24.783
to a stable solution of, say baking soda.

05:27.578 --> 05:28.579
Exactly.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.498
Can't do it.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.917
What? Why?

05:34.001 --> 05:38.255
We swore an oath to never, ever, ever
attend dancing school.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.592
It's just one lesson.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.969
You break an oath, you pay the price.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.847
Look, if oaths weren't meant to be broken,

05:46.930 --> 05:49.933
then why were counter-oaths invented?

05:52.519 --> 05:55.731
One, two, three. One, two, three.

05:55.814 --> 05:58.775
Our parents are in cahoots.
Mine just tried this.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.777
One, two, three.

06:00.861 --> 06:06.241
Oh, Harriet, so glad you're here.
Mr. Gibbs and I were just having a waltz.

06:06.325 --> 06:08.243
Would you girls care to join us?

06:08.327 --> 06:11.997
Come on, Janie. It's high time
you learned a few graces.

06:12.080 --> 06:15.167
One, two, three. One, two, three.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.878
One, two, three. One, two, three.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.630
One, two, three.

06:19.713 --> 06:23.091
All right, enough.
I'll go to dancing school.

06:33.810 --> 06:37.648
It itches. Why does it itch?
This thing is made out of ants.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.942
I feel like a poodle.

06:40.984 --> 06:42.945
This is the worst day of my life.

06:44.488 --> 06:47.908
It'll all be over soon.
You ready for the counter-oath?

06:59.878 --> 07:06.093
School dancing attend ever, ever,
never to promise, Welsch M. Harriet, I.

07:06.176 --> 07:10.973
School dancing attend ever, ever,
never to promise, Gibbs Janie, I.

07:11.849 --> 07:14.476
Our first counter-oath. I feel dizzy.

07:25.696 --> 07:29.616
It's like having hooves.
Who can walk in these things?

07:29.700 --> 07:30.909
Oh, right.

07:31.994 --> 07:34.037
Who said you could look at me?

07:37.583 --> 07:39.001
Silence, children!

07:40.961 --> 07:44.173
I am Mr. Dubois, your dance instructor.

07:45.883 --> 07:46.925
What's your name?

07:47.009 --> 07:48.927
Harriet M. Welsch.

07:52.556 --> 07:54.141
I do love a project.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.399
Relax your shoulders.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.318
Your hand placement is too low.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.987
Feet shoulder width apart.

08:08.197 --> 08:09.907
Excellent, Miss Hawthorne.

08:09.990 --> 08:15.078
This is posture, and it speaks volumes.

08:15.162 --> 08:18.749
Why, by looking at a person's posture,
I can tell you many things.

08:18.832 --> 08:22.544
Their confidence, class, kindness, spirit…

08:22.628 --> 08:27.049
It'd be quicker to list the things
good posture can't say about a person.

08:27.549 --> 08:31.053
Miss Welsch, straighten up.
You're not the Hunchback of Notre Dame.

08:31.720 --> 08:35.807
I can't help it. Pinky's too short.
I have to bend over.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.149
Very good, Miss Gibbs.

08:45.442 --> 08:48.320
What was she doing? Why was she smiling?

08:48.403 --> 08:51.657
That's when I realized
it must be part of her plan.

08:51.740 --> 08:54.368
Of course. Become the teacher's pet,

08:54.451 --> 08:57.412
earn his trust,
then blow it up from the inside.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.331
It was only a matter of time.

09:00.207 --> 09:04.253
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three.

09:04.336 --> 09:07.297
Problem was,
Janie's plan was taking way too long.

09:07.381 --> 09:08.382
Janie.

09:09.758 --> 09:10.759
Harriet!

09:10.843 --> 09:13.136
-What?
-You're stepping on my toes.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.306
Miss Welsch.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.934
My back is straight.

09:19.685 --> 09:23.605
You're ahead of the beat.
Follow Mr. Whitehead's lead.

09:24.398 --> 09:25.899
It's the gloves' fault.

09:25.983 --> 09:29.945
They're itching my hands
and it's trickling down to my feet.

09:30.028 --> 09:31.154
Stop!

09:33.073 --> 09:35.409
You must not remove your gloves.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.286
But what about the itch?

09:37.369 --> 09:39.538
They are not for your comfort,
Miss Welsch.

09:39.621 --> 09:44.209
They're to protect you from your partner's
grubby, sweaty, germ-infected hands.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.513
Purple Socks, I'm cutting in.

09:57.139 --> 09:59.266
I can't take another minute of this.

10:00.684 --> 10:01.685
What's the plan?

10:02.352 --> 10:04.188
I don't know how to explain this.

10:04.271 --> 10:08.358
-Then the plan's too complicated.
-I kinda like dancing.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.652
No, you don't.

10:10.736 --> 10:12.362
Yeah, I do.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.907
-But you always hated it.
-Because I never tried it.

10:14.990 --> 10:17.868
Miss Welsch,
return to your partner at once.

10:20.829 --> 10:24.333
-Come on, Pinky.
-But I'm supposed to lead.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.210
Well, then lead. That way.

10:31.256 --> 10:34.468
Janie. You were right
about the oath. Breaking it was--

10:34.551 --> 10:36.261
Circle back, circle back!

10:36.345 --> 10:40.390
…a big mistake. I want to restore it.
Maybe we can invent a counter--

10:42.768 --> 10:44.436
Watch where you are going.

10:44.520 --> 10:46.605
But you told me not to look at you.

10:48.899 --> 10:52.152
A counter-counter-oath.
Let's do a counter-counter-oath.

10:52.236 --> 10:54.488
No. I'm happy we broke the oath.

10:54.571 --> 10:57.157
I never would have tried dancing
otherwise.

10:57.699 --> 10:59.284
But-- Come here, you.

11:03.664 --> 11:04.665
Miss Welsch!

11:04.748 --> 11:09.086
You are leading, not following
like young ladies are supposed to.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.589
What? Only boys can lead? Why?

11:12.673 --> 11:17.761
This is how it is always done
because boys are bigger and stronger.

11:17.845 --> 11:20.514
But she's like twice as big as me.

11:20.597 --> 11:21.890
You'll get bigger.

11:21.974 --> 11:23.267
You haven't met my dad.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.270
It's not fair. Girls can lead too.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.396
Right, Janie?

11:30.315 --> 11:33.777
Okay, so
I couldn't count on Janie at the moment.

11:33.861 --> 11:39.032
But when she saw what I was about to do,
well, she'd have my back.

11:41.118 --> 11:45.664
Come on, everybody, cut loose.
There are no rules.

11:52.296 --> 11:55.048
Girls can lead,
and you don't need a partner,

11:55.132 --> 11:58.760
and you don't need blisters!

12:01.847 --> 12:03.974
Cut this nonsense immediately.

12:05.142 --> 12:10.272
This isn't nonsense, Mr. Dubois.
This is a revolution!

12:10.355 --> 12:14.484
Throw away the shackles of tradition.
Express yourselves.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.945
Beth Ellen, you know you want to.

12:19.323 --> 12:20.324
Pinky?

12:21.825 --> 12:25.871
That is not where your hand goes,
Mr. Whitehead. Wash it immediately.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.249
Janie?

12:47.851 --> 12:50.145
Sport, I need your help.

12:50.229 --> 12:52.147
Hey, I'm in the middle of practice.

12:52.231 --> 12:54.650
But I need the keeper of the oaths.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.402
One sec.

12:59.613 --> 13:01.949
Coach, I gotta use the restroom.

13:02.032 --> 13:05.327
Hey, come on. The oath book's
at the bottom of my locker.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.249
It's not here. You said it was here.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.006
Secret compartment. Nice.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.261
Okay, Sport, listen up.

13:22.344 --> 13:25.013
I did a counter-oath
and it was a big mistake.

13:25.097 --> 13:28.141
-And now I have to find--
-Sport, get back here.

13:28.225 --> 13:30.060
I need to get back to practice.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.482
Hey, you find anything helpful?

13:35.566 --> 13:36.567
No.

13:37.734 --> 13:40.237
Who was your witness
when you did the counter-oath?

13:40.320 --> 13:43.115
Counter-oaths don't need witnesses.
Do they?

13:43.740 --> 13:47.619
Yes, they do.
Page 27, article four, section B.

13:47.703 --> 13:49.204
Sport, defense!

13:58.547 --> 13:59.548
Janie.

14:00.716 --> 14:02.759
Sport, what are you doing here?

14:02.843 --> 14:04.303
We gotta talk.

14:05.262 --> 14:07.931
"Like any other oath,
a counter-oath must have a witness.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.517
Without one, it's invalid. Therefore--"

14:10.601 --> 14:12.978
Our counter-oath was invalid.

14:13.061 --> 14:16.690
Yep. No dancing school. Never, ever, ever.

14:16.773 --> 14:19.943
-But we already started.
-You need to find a way out.

14:20.027 --> 14:23.572
I say we head back in there, go berserko
and get kicked out for good.

14:23.655 --> 14:26.491
That way the oath is
never in danger again.

14:26.575 --> 14:31.121
Or we could redo the counter-oath,
right here, with Sport as our witness.

14:31.205 --> 14:36.335
No, if we do that we'd be defending a rule
that says girls can't lead.

14:40.339 --> 14:42.132
Is this really what you want?

14:45.969 --> 14:49.056
All right. An oath is an oath.

14:53.185 --> 14:57.231
Miss Welsch, I appreciate
the attitude adjustment.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.068
So what's the plan?

15:01.568 --> 15:03.362
Ask Pinky to ask you to dance.

15:07.324 --> 15:09.034
Pinky, ask me to dance.

15:09.952 --> 15:13.872
-Okay. Wait, is this a trap?
-Pinky!

15:13.956 --> 15:15.958
May I have this dance?

15:17.042 --> 15:18.293
My pleasure.

15:20.879 --> 15:25.926
She's surrendered to the joys of dance.
They always do.

15:28.762 --> 15:29.888
What now?

15:39.231 --> 15:40.816
Put those back on!

15:47.698 --> 15:48.949
The germs.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.327
The coarseness!

15:54.454 --> 15:56.790
The horror!

15:58.917 --> 16:00.878
I knew this was a trap.

16:02.004 --> 16:04.798
You two. Go.

16:05.549 --> 16:07.926
Did you see his face?

16:09.178 --> 16:10.721
Hey, wanna get egg creams?

16:10.804 --> 16:13.056
I don't start my spy route till 4:00.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.184
Is dance really so terrible?

16:16.018 --> 16:19.271
Or is it only terrible because
you're bad at it and I'm good?

16:20.564 --> 16:22.608
It's terrible for a million reasons,

16:22.691 --> 16:25.319
but mostly because
girls have to follow boys.

16:25.402 --> 16:26.820
How can you accept that?

16:26.904 --> 16:28.864
Because I'm used to it.

16:28.947 --> 16:32.409
You always lead, and I always follow.
And I'm sick of it.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.869
I don't always lead.

16:33.952 --> 16:34.953
Yes, you do.

16:37.623 --> 16:41.502
Said the girl who stormed off
leaving her best friend behind.

16:45.714 --> 16:48.050
To take my mind off the Janie situation,

16:48.133 --> 16:51.303
I went to go spy on Mr. Withers
and his 26 cats.

16:51.887 --> 16:54.640
Unfortunately, my mind had other ideas.

16:55.474 --> 16:58.769
Do you know
why you're all my best friends?

16:58.852 --> 17:00.103
Why?

17:00.187 --> 17:04.608
Because you always listen to me,
are always loyal

17:04.691 --> 17:08.194
and never in a million years
go to dance class.

17:08.819 --> 17:12.574
I don't want to be loyal. You always lead.

17:13.742 --> 17:14.826
I wanna dance.

17:15.953 --> 17:18.329
Why do we always
have to do things your way?

17:18.413 --> 17:19.915
Yeah.

17:26.547 --> 17:29.675
I don't always lead. Do I?

17:29.758 --> 17:33.136
I'd happily follow Janie.
I'd follow her anywhere.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.721
Well, not off a cliff.

17:34.805 --> 17:37.808
Dance is like a cliff
I won't follow Janie off of.

17:38.517 --> 17:43.438
I mean, dance is like a cliff off of which
I won't follow Janie.

17:43.522 --> 17:45.941
Which is better English but sounds weird.

17:51.280 --> 17:52.489
Hello, Harriet.

17:52.573 --> 17:53.949
May I speak to Janie?

17:54.032 --> 17:55.993
I don't think she wants to speak to you.

17:56.076 --> 17:59.538
And after what you did in dancing class,
I don't blame her.

18:01.748 --> 18:02.749
Okay.

18:05.210 --> 18:08.839
Mrs. Gibbs was not going to
keep me and Janie apart.

18:11.425 --> 18:13.802
Our friendship was at stake here.

18:19.266 --> 18:22.102
We needed to talk things out.
I'd explain myself,

18:22.186 --> 18:25.564
tell her that leading was tough,
but she could do it.

18:33.155 --> 18:36.700
Wow. She was really good.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.578
And happy in a way I'd never seen before.

18:41.538 --> 18:46.585
I knew what I had to do,
and I did not like it one bit.

18:47.419 --> 18:50.339
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two--

18:51.632 --> 18:56.053
-Miss Welsch? I thought I told you--
-Everything that happened was my idea.

18:56.136 --> 18:59.598
Janie didn't want to sabotage your class.
I made her do it.

19:01.475 --> 19:03.268
What on earth are you wearing?

19:04.228 --> 19:06.772
-You have to readmit her.
-No.

19:06.855 --> 19:09.983
Please. She loves dance
and she's good at it.

19:10.067 --> 19:11.068
I said no.

19:12.194 --> 19:13.904
I'll do anything.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.239
Anything?

19:16.823 --> 19:21.036
If you ever wanna make a deal,
never agree to the word "anything."

19:23.288 --> 19:26.083
It's wrinkled. Start over.

19:29.253 --> 19:33.966
The good news is, the next day,
Mr. Dubois let Janie back in the class.

19:38.095 --> 19:39.096
Hey.

19:39.596 --> 19:40.597
Hey.

19:40.681 --> 19:45.227
So it was pretty good how I got Mr. Dubois
to let you back in, huh?

19:46.979 --> 19:52.776
What I meant to say was, about earlier,

19:52.860 --> 19:54.403
I'm sorry.

19:55.946 --> 19:57.406
Can we cut the chitchat?

19:57.489 --> 19:59.992
My hands are getting
a little germy over here.

20:02.160 --> 20:06.039
I thought that saying sorry
was supposed to make everything better.

20:06.123 --> 20:08.458
But maybe that wasn't always true.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.796
When it finally came time
for the dance recital,

20:12.880 --> 20:18.135
I politely sat in the audience and,
to mingle a line from good old Mr. Dubois,

20:18.218 --> 20:21.805
surrendered to the joy of
watching Janie dance.

20:21.889 --> 20:24.183
I ironed the gloves.

20:25.934 --> 20:27.311
What's the matter?

20:27.394 --> 20:28.937
I wish you were out there.

20:33.317 --> 20:34.818
Dancing school.

20:34.902 --> 20:38.488
The only good thing about it
was that Marion wasn't the best.

20:42.201 --> 20:43.410
Janie was.

21:09.269 --> 21:12.105
Miss Welsch, may I have this dance?

21:12.606 --> 21:13.607
What?

21:13.690 --> 21:15.526
Janie, what are you doing?

21:15.609 --> 21:17.402
Asking Harriet to dance.

21:17.986 --> 21:19.988
I can't. I'm terrible.

21:20.072 --> 21:22.699
Just follow my lead for once.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.244
It would be my pleasure.

21:29.081 --> 21:31.750
No! Miss Welsch, Miss Gibbs. Stop this!

21:33.627 --> 21:35.712
Mrs. Welsch, Mrs. Gibbs!

21:36.380 --> 21:37.881
At least they're dancing.

21:39.216 --> 21:40.509
That's true.

21:43.178 --> 21:45.222
Harriet, you're stepping on my toes.

21:45.305 --> 21:46.932
I told you I'm bad at this.

21:48.100 --> 21:52.813
Hey, I've been thinking,
and I wanna make another oath.

21:52.896 --> 21:55.190
To not make any more oaths?

21:55.274 --> 21:57.150
You read my mind.

22:08.912 --> 22:11.415
Miss Hansen! What are you doing?

22:14.084 --> 22:15.210
Mr. Whitehead!

22:16.170 --> 22:21.508
Never mind. Go ahead, dance.
Just don't take off your gloves.

22:24.303 --> 22:26.388
Ole Golly was right.

22:26.471 --> 22:30.017
You have to know everything
if you're going to be a writer.

22:30.100 --> 22:33.395
And even though I never really
learned how to dance,

22:33.478 --> 22:35.105
I learned something better,

22:35.189 --> 22:40.110
that a best friend has to know
when to lead and when to follow.
