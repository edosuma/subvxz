11:13.404 --> 11:15.908
Did You Know That According
To The Laws Of Hydrodynamics,

11:15.941 --> 11:19.011
It's Impossible For A Dolphin
To Swim As Fast As It Does.

11:20.644 --> 11:22.480
Heh.

11:22.514 --> 11:24.582

To Do With Their Skin,

11:24.615 --> 11:26.418
Which Actually Ripples With
The Movement Of The Water.

11:26.451 --> 11:28.019
It Also Sheds
A Lot Faster Than Ours.

11:31.355 --> 11:33.057
No Way.

11:33.091 --> 11:35.461
But The Most
Fascinating Thing

11:35.494 --> 11:36.928
Is That Dolphins
Were Once Land Animals,

11:36.961 --> 11:38.297
Mammals,
Like Other Creatures.

11:38.330 --> 11:39.698
Suzy: But They're
Still Mammals?

11:39.730 --> 11:41.633
Yes. Yes, They're Mammals.
They're Not Fish.

11:41.666 --> 11:43.435
They Were Actually Small Whales Who Left The Land

11:43.467 --> 11:46.038
Sometime In Prehistory
And Returned To The Sea.

11:46.071 --> 11:46.939
As Far As I Know,

11:46.971 --> 11:48.706

Are The Only Creatures

11:48.740 --> 11:49.942
To Ever Do That.

11:52.344 --> 11:53.679

Half Sea Creature.

11:55.647 --> 11:57.216
Vicky, That's Ridiculous.

11:57.249 --> 11:58.683
Well, Actually,
I've Read Theories

11:58.716 --> 12:01.519
That Ancient Mariners Mistook Dolphins And Porpoises

12:01.552 --> 12:02.386
For Mermaids.

12:02.421 --> 12:04.289
That's Probably
How The Myth Came To Be.

12:04.322 --> 12:05.624
It Wasn't A Myth
To Them.

12:05.657 --> 12:06.658
They Were At Sea
For Years.

12:06.691 --> 12:08.527
They Needed There
To Be Mermaids.

12:11.296 --> 12:13.165

Recording Equipment?

About Her Calf.

Looks Pregnant.

So, What Do You Think
About Adam?

13:19.630 --> 13:21.432
Why?

13:21.466 --> 13:23.769
Just Curious.

13:23.802 --> 13:25.671
I'm Not Crazy
About His Research.

13:25.703 --> 13:26.737
When You Deal
With Nature,

13:26.770 --> 13:28.306
There's Too Many
Intangibles.

13:28.340 --> 13:31.310
I'll Take Numbers,
Thank You.

13:31.342 --> 13:34.579
But You Study Stars.
Don't You Consider Them

13:34.613 --> 13:37.282
Part Of, You Know,
Nature?

14:02.139 --> 14:04.141

14:07.144 --> 14:08.813
Man: You Look Pretty Tired.
You All Right?

14:08.846 --> 14:10.448
But I Have To.

14:10.481 --> 14:12.817
All Right.

14:26.764 --> 14:28.432
Hello, Enid.

14:28.466 --> 14:29.400
Are You Feeling Better?

14:29.433 --> 14:30.635

14:30.668 --> 14:32.571
You Can Tell 'Em Apart
Already?

14:33.837 --> 14:35.339
Sure.

14:35.373 --> 14:37.242
So, What Are You
Doing Here?

14:37.274 --> 14:38.242
Where's Your Sister?

14:38.275 --> 14:40.645
She's Not Here.
You Want Me To Go?

14:40.678 --> 14:42.680
No. Actually, I Got
A Lot Of Work To Do.

14:42.714 --> 14:45.183
I Could Use The Help.
Come On.

14:49.488 --> 14:52.524
Oh, Vicky,
This Is Dr. Zand.

14:52.557 --> 14:54.526
Dr. Zand, This Is Vicky,
Reverend Noonan's Granddaughter.

14:54.558 --> 14:55.860
Nice To Meet You.

14:55.894 --> 14:56.894
Hi.

14:56.927 --> 14:58.362
How's Your Grandfather
Doing?

14:58.395 --> 15:00.164
He's Fine, Thanks.

15:00.197 --> 15:01.766
Alrighty, Here You Go.
This Should Fit.

15:01.799 --> 15:04.368
Uh, We're Off To The Bay
To Try Out The Echolocater.

15:04.402 --> 15:05.871
Good Luck.

15:04.402 --> 15:05.871
Alrighty.

15:05.903 --> 15:07.405
Let's Go.

15:12.644 --> 15:13.412
Dr. Zand
Has Recorded

15:13.445 --> 15:15.314
Hundreds Of Hours
Of Dolphin Sounds.

15:15.346 --> 15:16.581
We're Trying To Figure Out If They're Speaking

15:16.614 --> 15:18.383
Some Sort Of A Language,
Like Ours

15:18.416 --> 15:19.850
Or If Their
Communication Is Just,

15:19.884 --> 15:22.321
You Know, Instinctive,
Like Ants.

15:22.354 --> 15:25.190
Ants Never Seem Like
They're Having A Lot Of Fun.

15:25.222 --> 15:27.525
Yeah, You're Right.
Dolphins Do Seem To Have Fun.

15:27.558 --> 15:29.160
Almost A Sense Of Humor,

15:29.193 --> 15:30.261
Which Is A Sign
Of Intelligence.

15:30.294 --> 15:31.329
[High Frequency Signals]

15:31.363 --> 15:33.699
That Box Puts Out A Series Of Ultrasonic Impulses,

15:33.731 --> 15:35.433
Kind Of Like
A Dolphin's Call.

15:35.466 --> 15:37.168
We've Trained Basil To Come To It In The Pens,

15:37.201 --> 15:39.236
But Never
In Open Water.

15:41.206 --> 15:43.307
Basil?

15:44.341 --> 15:45.409
Did You Say "Basil"?

15:45.442 --> 15:47.278
Yeah.

15:47.312 --> 15:48.647
That's Enid's Mate.

15:48.679 --> 15:50.481
See, By Holding Enid
In The Pens,

15:50.514 --> 15:52.918
We Can Release Basil,
And He Won't Go Far.

15:52.951 --> 15:54.286
Dr. Zand Wants To Make Sure That We Can Call On Him

15:54.318 --> 15:56.387
When It's Time For Her
To Deliver Her Calf.

15:56.421 --> 15:58.690
What's That?

15:59.356 --> 16:01.826
Hey, That's Him.

16:19.010 --> 16:21.746
Now, Be Careful With This One, Vicky,
All Right?

16:21.779 --> 16:23.481
He's A Little Wilder Than The Ones In The Pen.

16:23.514 --> 16:25.384
He Can Be Snappish.

16:25.417 --> 16:27.485
Can You Blame Him?
You've Got His Wife Locked Up In Jail.

16:27.519 --> 16:30.489
Whoa! You're Petting Him.

16:30.522 --> 16:32.524
He Wants Me To.

16:32.557 --> 16:34.558
He's Got An Itch
Under His Fin.

16:34.591 --> 16:37.328
How Did You Know That?

16:34.591 --> 16:37.328

16:37.361 --> 16:39.831
I Don't Know It.
He Just...

16:39.864 --> 16:41.833
Seems Like It.

16:42.767 --> 16:45.302
Wow. I-I've Never
Seen Him This Friendly.

16:46.703 --> 16:49.340
[Chattering]

17:04.422 --> 17:05.723
Wait A Second.
What's This?

17:05.757 --> 17:07.925
He's Got A Fresh Scar.

17:09.661 --> 17:12.631
Hard... Sharp...

17:12.663 --> 17:15.532
Seaweed.

17:12.663 --> 17:15.532
Huh?

17:18.803 --> 17:20.672
Oh, Uh, Nothing.

17:20.704 --> 17:22.874
Look, This Is A Net Gash.
I Gotta Get Back.

17:27.045 --> 17:28.446
Now Basil
Has The Same Scar.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.015
That's The Third One
In The Last Week.

17:30.048 --> 17:31.316
Look,
It's The Drift Nets,

17:31.348 --> 17:32.349
And The <I>Marie Rose</I>
Is The Only One

17:32.383 --> 17:33.250
Big Enough To Use Them.

17:33.284 --> 17:34.853
What Do You Want Me
To Do About It, Adam?

17:34.885 --> 17:36.887
Well, We've Gotta Do Something.
I Mean, They're Illegal.

17:36.921 --> 17:40.459
How Are You So Sure
It's The <I>Marie Rose?</I>

17:40.491 --> 17:43.528
Look, Every Captain On This Island Is Complaining

17:43.560 --> 17:44.728
About The Lousy Catch
This Summer,

17:44.761 --> 17:46.565
And Every Couple Of Days
The <I>Marie Rose</I> Comes Back

17:46.597 --> 17:48.700
Overflowing With Fish.
It's Gotta Be Them.

17:48.732 --> 17:50.935
That's Not Enough,
Adam.

17:50.969 --> 17:54.072
I'm Sorry. I Hate Drift Nets, Too,
Believe Me...

17:54.105 --> 17:57.776
But We're A Research Center,
Not The Police.

17:57.808 --> 18:00.345
There's Nothing
We Can Do.

18:12.557 --> 18:15.493
Where's My Clear
Nail Polish?

18:18.429 --> 18:20.098
See? After They're Dead,

18:20.131 --> 18:21.432
You Put This Stuff
On 'Em,

18:21.465 --> 18:23.334
And It
Preserves 'Em.

With A Kid At School.

The Most By The End Of Summer.

18:31.509 --> 18:33.111
Why Can't You Just
Collect Baseball Cards,

Like Everybody Else?

18:37.848 --> 18:39.518
Oh, Man,
That Guy's Nuts.

18:39.550 --> 18:41.852
He Sure Is.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.629

More Careful.

18:51.663 --> 18:53.999

Even Get A Christmas Card.

That Kinda Hurt,

My Mother Died.

That's Not Funny.

She Came To The Brilliant Conclusion

20:08.538 --> 20:09.874
That I Was Deeply Sad

20:09.906 --> 20:12.143
Because My Mother
Had Died.

You Care To Tell Me
What It Is?

23:16.059 --> 23:19.129

23:19.163 --> 23:20.999
If I Told You--

Talking To Me,

23:34.444 --> 23:36.814
...And I Knew Rob

A Feeling...

And In, Like,

When Your Mother
Was A Baby,

24:51.756 --> 24:53.224
Grandfather,

24:53.257 --> 24:55.826
Why Is Everyone Asking You How You're Feeling?

24:55.859 --> 24:57.261
Darling,
When You're 81,

24:57.295 --> 24:58.997
People Are Amazed
That You're Walking,

24:59.029 --> 25:00.431
Talking,
And Taking Nourishment.

25:00.463 --> 25:02.966
Come On. Let's Go.

25:06.836 --> 25:08.405
It's Just So Weird.

25:08.439 --> 25:11.209
I Mean,
Every Time I Get Kicked Out Of A School,

25:11.241 --> 25:12.277
He's--He's So Furious,

25:12.309 --> 25:14.311
He Doesn't Even Speak
For A Week.

25:14.345 --> 25:17.781
Then The Next Thing You Know,
He Buys Me A Car Or A Boat.

25:17.815 --> 25:20.485
Does He Ever Talk
About Your Mother?

25:20.518 --> 25:22.319
Not A Chance.

25:22.353 --> 25:25.957
I Mean, Business,
Golf, The Stock Market,

25:25.990 --> 25:28.192
No Problem.

25:28.224 --> 25:30.894
I Think He's More Messed Up Than I Am.

25:32.896 --> 25:35.899
I Forgot How Good
You Are For Me, Vic,

25:35.932 --> 25:38.036
How Much I Like
Being With You.

25:38.068 --> 25:39.236
Adam: Hey, Vicky.

25:40.403 --> 25:42.539
Hi.

25:42.573 --> 25:45.243
Um, Adam Ennington,
Zachary Gray.

25:45.276 --> 25:46.244
I Didn't
Get A Chance

25:46.277 --> 25:47.278
To Introduce You
Yesterday.

25:47.310 --> 25:48.211
Thomas Gray's Son?

25:48.246 --> 25:50.949
That's What It Says
On My Birth Certificate.

25:50.981 --> 25:53.017
But He's Been Known
To Deny It.

25:53.049 --> 25:56.186
Your Father's Company Is Using
Drift Nets On The <I>Marie Rose</I>

25:56.220 --> 25:59.023
To Supply His Cannery.

25:59.056 --> 26:01.558
All Right, I Give Up.
What's A Drift Net?

26:04.595 --> 26:06.130
They're Called
Walls Of Death.

26:06.163 --> 26:07.498
They Stretch Out
For Miles Underwater,

26:07.530 --> 26:08.832
And They Catch
Everything And Anything

26:08.865 --> 26:09.834
That Comes By.

26:09.866 --> 26:10.734
They End Up
Catching Dolphins,

26:10.768 --> 26:12.202
Even Though The Fishermen
Don't Want Them.

26:12.236 --> 26:14.038
So, What's The Problem?

26:14.070 --> 26:15.173
They Can Just
Throw 'Em Back.

26:15.205 --> 26:16.307
They're Dead By Then.

26:16.339 --> 26:18.509
Dolphins Have To
Come Up To Breathe,

26:18.541 --> 26:20.110
But The Nets Hold Them Down,
And They Drown.

26:20.144 --> 26:21.479
That's Why
They're Illegal.

26:21.511 --> 26:22.579
Well, Then,
Why Are You Telling Me?

26:22.613 --> 26:23.514
Go To The Cops.

26:23.548 --> 26:27.085
Does You Father Really Use These, Zachary?

26:29.420 --> 26:31.422
Have You Become
A Dolphin Hugger, Vic?

26:33.356 --> 26:35.460
Maybe.

26:38.128 --> 26:42.399
Ok, Then.
Uh, Anything For A Lady.

26:42.432 --> 26:44.402
We'll Check It Out Tonight.

26:44.434 --> 26:48.472
[Foghorn Blows]

26:48.506 --> 26:50.475
Come On.

26:58.048 --> 27:02.153
So, Uh,
Who's Dudley Doright?

27:02.185 --> 27:04.288
Just A Friend.

27:04.320 --> 27:06.523
Look, Uh, Guys,

27:06.557 --> 27:08.893
My Dad
Isn't Gonna Love Me

27:08.925 --> 27:09.894
Sneakin'
Aboard His Ship

27:09.926 --> 27:11.161
With A Couple
Of Greenpeacers,

27:11.194 --> 27:13.397
So, Um...

27:13.431 --> 27:17.101
You Know, Stay Here And Keep A Lookout,
Will You, Vic?

27:17.134 --> 27:19.437
Sure.

27:27.944 --> 27:30.947
So, Uh,
You Known Vicky Long?

27:30.980 --> 27:32.349
Oh, No. Just A Few Days,

27:32.383 --> 27:34.619
But She Seems Great.

27:34.652 --> 27:37.221
Let Me See.
Help Me With This.

27:42.125 --> 27:43.094
Who's Out There?

27:43.126 --> 27:47.130
Uh, It's...
Zachary Gray, Captain.

27:48.965 --> 27:51.034
Captain: What You Doin'
Out Here, Zachary?

27:51.067 --> 27:53.904
Oh, I'm Just, Uh,
Just Showin' Some Friends Around.

27:53.938 --> 27:54.906
Hey, Adam.

27:54.939 --> 27:56.673
Yeah.

27:56.707 --> 27:58.376
You Ready To Go,
Buddy?

27:58.409 --> 27:59.576
Yeah.

28:04.214 --> 28:06.183
Well, Good Night,
Captain.

28:06.217 --> 28:07.652
Yeah.
Thanks, Captain.

28:07.684 --> 28:09.252
Good Night, Boys.

28:14.191 --> 28:16.059
I Saw A Float
Under The Tarp.

28:16.093 --> 28:18.563
It's Drift Net,
All Right.

28:27.637 --> 28:30.707
Well, That Wasn't
Exactly The Way

28:30.740 --> 28:33.544
I'd Planned On Ending
The Evening.

28:33.576 --> 28:35.946
And What
Had You Planned?

28:43.621 --> 28:45.389
Come On,

28:45.422 --> 28:47.057
You've Missed Me
A Little, Haven't You?

28:47.090 --> 28:50.527
Yeah. A Little.

28:57.034 --> 28:59.036
Good Night.

28:59.068 --> 29:00.504
Good Night, Vic.

29:00.538 --> 29:02.073
Dream About Me, Ok?

29:20.624 --> 29:22.527
[Dolphins Echolocating]

30:10.307 --> 30:11.409
And According To The Maritime Preservation Act

30:11.442 --> 30:12.543
Of 1994--

30:12.576 --> 30:14.745
Ok, Adam. Ok.
You Convinced Me.

30:14.778 --> 30:17.248
When The <I>Marie Rose</I>
Gets Back In Port,

30:17.280 --> 30:18.648
I'll Take A Look.

30:17.280 --> 30:18.648
I Know, But Sometimes--

30:18.682 --> 30:20.651
Ok...

30:20.683 --> 30:22.787
Happy?

30:25.355 --> 30:27.258
Stop It, Rob.
Get It Away From Me.

30:27.290 --> 30:28.259
It's Just A--

30:28.291 --> 30:30.427
No. Ew, It's Ugly.

30:30.461 --> 30:32.296
No, It's Pretty.

30:32.328 --> 30:33.297
Get It Away!

30:33.329 --> 30:34.331
Come On. Come On.

30:34.365 --> 30:36.299
Get It Away.

30:34.365 --> 30:36.299
Keep Close.

30:39.135 --> 30:41.439
Gross! Gross!

30:41.471 --> 30:42.772
Come On, Suzy.

30:42.806 --> 30:44.775
Dinner Is Served.

30:46.175 --> 30:48.144
Grandfather,
Look At This Stick Bug.

30:48.178 --> 30:49.146
It's Huge!

30:49.179 --> 30:50.681
That's Wonderful, Rob.

30:50.713 --> 30:52.250
I Think It's
Disgusting.

30:52.282 --> 30:53.783
Ha Ha. Vicky,

30:53.817 --> 30:55.752
While You Were
Down At The Beach,

30:55.786 --> 31:00.324
A Present Came
For You.

31:00.356 --> 31:02.460
Vicky: Hey!

31:04.161 --> 31:06.497
"Love, Zachary."
How Nice.

31:06.529 --> 31:07.764
What Did Adam
Send You,

31:07.798 --> 31:08.798
A Bucket Of Fish?

31:08.832 --> 31:10.501
For Someone So Smart,

31:10.534 --> 31:13.104
Why Are You
So Immature Sometimes?

31:13.136 --> 31:16.406
I Just Don't Understand
The Whole Dating Thing.

31:16.440 --> 31:18.342
I'm Not Dating Adam.

31:18.375 --> 31:19.343
You Know What I Mean.

31:19.375 --> 31:20.778
Going From One Guy
To The Next

31:20.810 --> 31:22.413
Till You Find The One
You Really Like.

31:22.445 --> 31:26.516
Part Of The Whole
Adventure Of Life, Suzy.

31:26.549 --> 31:28.618
Anything As Illogical
As Dating

31:28.652 --> 31:30.621
Is Such A Waste
Of Time And Energy.

31:30.653 --> 31:31.588
When I Get Older,

31:31.622 --> 31:33.524
I'm Just Gonna Find
The One Guy I Really Like,

31:33.557 --> 31:36.294
And, You Know,
That'll Be It.

31:36.326 --> 31:37.127
How Romantic.

31:37.161 --> 31:40.197
I'm Never Gonna Date.
Girls Are Gross.

31:40.230 --> 31:42.199
You're Walking Around With A Jar Full Of Dead Bugs,

31:42.231 --> 31:43.200
And Girls Are Gross?

31:43.232 --> 31:46.604
So, Um, This Guy
You Pick Out,

31:46.636 --> 31:48.705
What If He Doesn't
Like You Back?

31:48.739 --> 31:50.441
Don't Be Ridiculous.

31:50.473 --> 31:51.608
Hello.

31:51.642 --> 31:53.443
More Books.

31:53.477 --> 31:54.845
Adam. Heh Heh.

31:54.877 --> 31:56.780
Care To Join Us
For Dinner?

31:56.814 --> 31:58.716
Yeah, Sure.

31:58.749 --> 32:01.218
It's The Only Decent Meal I Ever Get, Anyway.

32:04.587 --> 32:06.156
Grandfather:
Shall We?

32:09.425 --> 32:13.230
Well, I Grew Up In St. Louis,
You Know,

32:13.262 --> 32:14.230
So I Never Even
Saw An Ocean

32:14.263 --> 32:15.365
Until My Parents
Took Me To Florida

32:15.398 --> 32:16.666
When I Was 10.

32:16.700 --> 32:18.269
Is That When You Saw
Your First Dolphin?

32:18.301 --> 32:19.869
Yeah. Yeah, It Was.

32:19.903 --> 32:21.806
But, Uh, You Know,
It Wasn't In A Tank

32:21.838 --> 32:24.207
Or A Theme Park
Or Anything.

32:24.240 --> 32:25.342
I Was Actually
In The Ocean,

32:25.375 --> 32:28.179
And All Of A Sudden I See All These Fins Coming At Me.

32:28.211 --> 32:29.246
I Thought It Was Sharks.

32:29.278 --> 32:32.383
So I Panicked,
And I Stayed Very Still.

32:32.415 --> 32:37.454
And Then They Came Closer And Closer,
You Know?

32:37.488 --> 32:38.689
And All Of A Sudden,
One Of 'Em Just

32:38.721 --> 32:40.223
Leaps Out
Of The Water

32:40.257 --> 32:42.259
Without Any Effort,
Like It Had Wings.

32:42.291 --> 32:43.727
I Didn't Know Much
At The Time,

32:43.760 --> 32:46.196
But I Knew Sharks Couldn't Do Anything Like That.

32:46.230 --> 32:48.365
So I Relaxed
A Little Bit

32:48.398 --> 32:51.901
As The Whole Pod
Just Glided Past Me.

32:52.869 --> 32:55.538
I Remember I Reached Out
With Both My Hands,

32:55.571 --> 32:57.340
Feeling Them.

32:57.374 --> 33:00.478
So Smooth And Graceful.

33:00.510 --> 33:03.646
They Formed A Ring
Around Me

33:03.680 --> 33:05.216
And Just Kept Circling.

33:06.983 --> 33:10.855
And Then, Just As Quickly,
They Were Gone.

33:10.887 --> 33:12.990
Anyway,

33:13.022 --> 33:15.458
I Knew Right Then That I Wanted To Study Them.

33:15.491 --> 33:17.360
That Must Have Been
So Beautiful.

33:17.394 --> 33:20.897
Yeah. Yeah, It Was,

33:20.931 --> 33:22.700
But It Was Kind Of
A Strange Experience

33:22.732 --> 33:24.467
To Base
A Life Decision On.

33:24.500 --> 33:26.537
Why?

33:26.569 --> 33:29.906
Well, Vicky,
I'm Not Convinced About Anything

33:29.940 --> 33:31.275
Unless I Can
Prove It.

33:31.307 --> 33:32.809
But You Borrow
Philosophy Books

33:32.843 --> 33:33.677
From My Grandfather,

33:33.711 --> 33:35.679
And Nobody Can Prove
That Stuff, Either.

33:35.711 --> 33:36.813
Vicky...

33:36.846 --> 33:39.549
Maybe The Dolphins Were Trying
To Communicate With You,

33:39.583 --> 33:40.651
Touch You.

33:40.683 --> 33:42.252
I'm Just Saying,

33:42.286 --> 33:43.721
If A Beautiful Thing
Happens To You,

33:43.753 --> 33:45.555
You Don't Have To--

33:45.588 --> 33:47.857
I Don't Know,
Get Out A Calculator And Figure It Out.

33:47.891 --> 33:49.960
Well, I'm A Scientist,
Vicky, All Right?

33:49.992 --> 33:52.663
That's What Scientists Do.
We Figure Things Out.

33:52.695 --> 33:54.531
Hello?

33:54.565 --> 33:56.634
Dan.

33:56.666 --> 33:58.903
Hey.

34:00.971 --> 34:03.406
Am I Interrupting Anything?

34:03.440 --> 34:06.277
Please Do.

34:07.978 --> 34:09.480
Thank You.

34:09.512 --> 34:12.449
I Was There When
The <I>Marie Rose</I> Pulled In.

34:12.483 --> 34:14.485
The Captain Let Me
Look All Around,

34:14.518 --> 34:15.518
Which He Didn't
Have To Do.

34:15.552 --> 34:17.487
It's Not Like I Had A Search Warrant Or Anything.

34:17.521 --> 34:18.722
And?

34:18.755 --> 34:21.992
Adam, There Are
No Drift Nets On That Boat.

34:22.025 --> 34:23.626
But We Saw Them.

34:23.659 --> 34:26.329
Look, He Knew We Were Onto Him,
And He Hid Them.

34:26.362 --> 34:28.331
Look, Even If
I Did Find Them,

34:28.364 --> 34:30.967
Really, There's
Nothing I Can Do.

34:31.001 --> 34:33.871
The Law Says
You Have To Actually

34:33.902 --> 34:36.606
Catch Them Using A Drift Net To Prosecute.

34:36.639 --> 34:37.974
So You're Not
Gonna Do Anything?

34:38.007 --> 34:38.775
Is That What
You're Telling Me?

34:38.809 --> 34:39.976
You're Gonna Sit By
And Let Dolphins

34:40.010 --> 34:41.512
Keep Getting
Slaughtered?

34:41.545 --> 34:43.746
Thanks.
Thanks A Lot.

34:50.585 --> 34:51.755
Adam!

34:53.123 --> 34:54.492
Adam!

34:56.126 --> 34:57.995
[Sighs]

35:01.898 --> 35:03.366
Hope I Didn't Cause
Too Much Trouble.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.869
Dan, You're Just
Doing Your Job.

35:05.902 --> 35:07.871
All Right, Then.
Good Night.

35:07.905 --> 35:09.340
Good Night.

35:20.150 --> 35:21.818
Vicky, You Know,
I Don't Think

35:21.851 --> 35:23.953
Adam Has Ever
Met Anybody

35:23.987 --> 35:27.557
Who Challenges Him
Like You Do.

35:27.590 --> 35:30.493
Oh, I Can't
Figure Him Out.

35:30.527 --> 35:33.963
He Cares So Much,
But He Sees So Little.

35:39.769 --> 35:42.105
If I Were A Dolphin,
We'd Get Along Just Fine.

35:42.139 --> 35:44.375
[Chuckles]

35:54.717 --> 35:56.819
The Stars Are
Beautiful Tonight.

35:59.856 --> 36:00.991
Yeah.

36:04.126 --> 36:07.664
Suzy's Got Another.

36:07.697 --> 36:10.701
A Real Beauty, Too.
Wanna See It?

36:10.733 --> 36:15.672
No, No.
I Don't Look Through Telescopes Much Anymore, Vicky.

36:15.706 --> 36:18.075
Uh, It Takes Away
All The Magic...

36:18.108 --> 36:21.979
And I'll Promise You
That Suzy Knows

36:22.012 --> 36:26.417
The Name Of That Star,
The Weight, All The Details...

36:26.449 --> 36:28.585
[Chuckles]
And That's Good.

36:28.619 --> 36:32.890
That's Her Passion,
But Sometimes, I...

36:32.922 --> 36:35.558
Sometimes I Wish
She'd Just Sit Back

36:35.592 --> 36:37.061
And Enjoy
The Beauty Of It.

36:37.094 --> 36:39.630
They Are Beautiful.

36:39.663 --> 36:41.465
But You Know
The Amazing Thing About It?

36:41.498 --> 36:46.804
That Star Of Suzy's Could Have
Burned Out Thousands Of Years Ago,

36:46.836 --> 36:48.706
But The Light
Still Keeps Coming,

36:48.739 --> 36:50.206
And So What You Think
You're Looking At

36:50.239 --> 36:52.875
Isn't Necessarily
The Whole Truth,

36:52.909 --> 36:56.480
And That Applies
To People, You Know? Adam.

36:56.512 --> 36:57.981
[Sighs]

36:56.512 --> 36:57.981
No, No, No.
It's Possible

36:58.014 --> 37:02.719
That Adam's Real Light
Hasn't Reached You Yet,

37:02.753 --> 37:04.989
And That Doesn't Mean
It's Not There.

37:05.021 --> 37:09.592
Come With Me.
I Wanna--I Wanna Show You Something.

37:13.030 --> 37:18.702
Henry Vaughan.
17th Century.

37:18.735 --> 37:20.237
You Like That Century,
Don't You?

37:20.269 --> 37:22.538
Yes, Yes.
That Was--

37:22.572 --> 37:24.541
That Was A Good One.

37:27.043 --> 37:29.879
Ah...

37:29.913 --> 37:32.181
Listen.

37:32.215 --> 37:39.088
"I Saw Eternity
The Other Night,

37:39.121 --> 37:45.094
"Like A Great Ring
Of Pure And Endless Light,

37:45.128 --> 37:49.166
"All Calm
As It Was Bright;

37:49.199 --> 37:58.709
And Round Beneath It,
Time In Hours, Days, Years..."

38:01.878 --> 38:04.882
"Driv'n By The Spheres

38:04.914 --> 38:07.617
"Like A Vast Shadow Mov'd;

38:07.650 --> 38:14.625
In Which The World And All Her Train Were Hurl'd."

38:17.059 --> 38:18.027
[Chuckles]

38:18.061 --> 38:22.166
It's Beautiful.
It's Deep.

38:22.199 --> 38:26.537
Yeah, Yeah.
The 17th Century Was Very Deep.

38:26.570 --> 38:27.705
[Laughs]

38:27.737 --> 38:31.541
Sweetie, Read On.
I Think You'll Enjoy It.

38:31.574 --> 38:35.611
I'm Gonna Get These--
These Old Bones To Bed.

38:35.644 --> 38:38.181
[Chuckles]
Good Night, Darling.

38:58.135 --> 38:59.103
Thanks For
Letting Me Know.

38:59.135 --> 39:01.838
That's Right, Sir.
Thank You. Bye.

39:14.050 --> 39:15.652
I Hear You Visited
The <I>Marie Rose</I>

39:15.684 --> 39:17.121
With Some Friends
The Other Night.

39:17.153 --> 39:19.289
Yeah, They Like Boats.

39:19.322 --> 39:23.760
You Like The Way We Live,
Don't You, Zachary?

39:23.793 --> 39:27.029
The Cars, The Houses,
Especially This One?

39:27.063 --> 39:29.032
The Private Schools
You Occasionally Attend,

39:29.065 --> 39:31.367
You Like These Things,
Don't You?

39:31.400 --> 39:33.870
Well, In Order To Maintain Our Lifestyle,

39:33.903 --> 39:35.905
We Need To Maintain
Our Businesses,

39:35.938 --> 39:39.809
10 Ships And The Largest Independent
Cannery On The East Coast,

39:39.842 --> 39:41.811
The Business
My Father Started,

39:41.844 --> 39:43.780
The Business I Have
Worked Hard To Build Up,

39:43.813 --> 39:46.716
And A Business I Will
Not See You Destroy.

39:46.750 --> 39:50.052
Does Our Business
Use Drift Nets?

39:50.085 --> 39:53.222
Zachary, Toughen Up.

39:53.255 --> 39:55.291
I Am Sick Of Watchin'
You Mope Around

39:55.324 --> 39:57.226
Like Some Kind
Of 4-Year-Old.

40:01.797 --> 40:03.199
[Sighs]

40:03.233 --> 40:05.269
Dr. Zand:
Bring Her Over, Frank.

40:05.302 --> 40:07.237
Hold Her Steady.

40:07.269 --> 40:09.940
If She Delivers Breech,
She Could Die.

40:14.744 --> 40:15.711
What's Happening?

40:15.744 --> 40:16.512
It's Enid.

40:16.545 --> 40:18.347
She's Having A Difficult Delivery.

40:22.184 --> 40:23.719
[Clicks]

40:26.322 --> 40:27.790
Give Me The Hypodermic.

40:27.824 --> 40:29.193
Vicky: No!

40:29.226 --> 40:30.327
She Doesn't Want
To Be Sedated.

40:30.360 --> 40:31.961
She Needs To Be Alert.

40:31.994 --> 40:34.063
Vicky, Get Out Of Here.

40:31.994 --> 40:34.063
Wait.

40:34.097 --> 40:37.901
[Beeps]

40:39.001 --> 40:39.969
Basil's Here.

40:40.003 --> 40:41.972
She Wants Him With Her.

40:42.005 --> 40:43.340
[Clicks]

40:43.373 --> 40:44.974
Over There.

40:47.210 --> 40:50.313
[Squeals, Chirps]

40:50.347 --> 40:51.181
Oh, Man, I Forgot
To Call Him.

40:51.215 --> 40:53.917
It Doesn't Matter.
He Knows. Let Him In.

40:56.719 --> 40:59.789
It's Ok. Relax.

40:56.719 --> 40:59.789
[Clicks]

41:01.190 --> 41:02.992
Hey, Buddy.

41:07.230 --> 41:09.298
[Echolocates]

41:11.867 --> 41:13.703
Vicky: Here He Comes.

41:21.311 --> 41:22.211
Vicky: Ok, Now Back Off.

41:22.246 --> 41:25.115
She Wants Him To Help Her.
That's Their Way.

41:35.391 --> 41:37.360
The Baby's Coming Now.

41:45.802 --> 41:47.804
[Chirps]

41:47.836 --> 41:49.907
Yes.

42:03.954 --> 42:05.389
Vicky, What Just Happened?

42:11.994 --> 42:13.462
I Gotta Go.

42:13.496 --> 42:14.965
Vicky.

42:14.998 --> 42:17.833
Vicky, Wait!
Vicky!

42:17.867 --> 42:20.137
Vicky, Where
Are You Going?

42:20.170 --> 42:21.204
Home.

42:21.237 --> 42:22.505
You Communicated
With Her, Didn't You?

42:22.539 --> 42:24.408
I'm Going Home.

42:22.539 --> 42:24.408
No, You Did.

42:24.440 --> 42:26.242
You Know, There Was Something
The First Time When You Met Enid

42:26.275 --> 42:27.344
And Again With Basil
In The Bay,

42:27.376 --> 42:28.478
But I Didn't Think
Anything About It,

42:28.510 --> 42:30.079
But Now I See.

42:30.112 --> 42:32.415
You Communicated Telepathically,
Didn't You?

42:32.449 --> 42:34.217
Let Go Of The Bike.

42:32.449 --> 42:34.217
Didn't You? Didn't You?

42:34.250 --> 42:36.253
I Don't Know,
And I Don't Wanna Talk About It.

42:36.286 --> 42:37.253
But, Vicky, Don't You See?

42:37.286 --> 42:38.621
This Could Prove
That Dolphins

42:38.655 --> 42:41.892
Don't Only Communicate Vocally Or Instinctively,
But Telepathically.

42:41.925 --> 42:43.126
I Don't Care.

42:43.159 --> 42:44.327
Why Are You So Upset?

42:44.360 --> 42:45.528
I Mean, There Have Been
Cases Of Children

42:45.561 --> 42:48.197
Who Have A Certain Level
Of Sensitivity--

42:48.231 --> 42:50.067
Children?

42:48.231 --> 42:50.067
Yes. Of Course,

42:50.099 --> 42:51.201
We've Never Given It
Much Credence Because--

42:51.233 --> 42:53.302
Is That What You
Think I Am, A Child?

42:53.335 --> 42:54.971
Vicky, I Didn't Mean--

42:55.005 --> 42:57.039
I Am Not Your Case,
And I Am Not A Child.

42:57.072 --> 42:58.040
Now I'm Going Home.

42:58.074 --> 43:01.177
Vicky,
I'm Sorry. I...

43:06.615 --> 43:07.985
[Camera Clicks]

43:09.152 --> 43:11.521
[Click]

43:23.032 --> 43:26.168
Yes.

43:28.038 --> 43:30.974
[Click, Click]

43:37.313 --> 43:38.481
Hi.

43:41.050 --> 43:43.253
Hi.

43:43.286 --> 43:44.253
Uh...

43:44.286 --> 43:46.956
Suzy Told Me
I Might Find You Here.

43:50.193 --> 43:51.228
What Ya Writin'?

43:51.260 --> 43:53.864
Nothing.
What Do You Want?

43:53.896 --> 43:56.565
[Sighs]
Look...

43:58.467 --> 44:01.070
I'm Sorry If I Made You
Feel Like A Freak Yesterday.

44:01.103 --> 44:03.272
And A Child.
Don't Forget That Part.

44:03.306 --> 44:05.175
I Know, But You Wouldn't
Let Me Finish.

44:05.208 --> 44:07.476
Vicki, There Is Tons Of Scientific Data Out There That--

44:07.510 --> 44:10.380
Is That All You Ever
Talk About, Data?

44:10.413 --> 44:12.048
Well, I've Got News
For You, Adam.

44:12.081 --> 44:13.650
I Don't Know
Why I Can Do This.

44:13.682 --> 44:16.420
It's Not Like I Hear Specific Words Or Anything.

44:16.452 --> 44:18.121
I Don't
Speak Dolphin.

44:18.153 --> 44:20.891
It's Just A Feeling,
And It Kinda Scares Me, Ok?

44:20.923 --> 44:22.925
I Know. If You Would Just Let Us Study You,
Maybe We--

44:22.958 --> 44:26.228
I Don't Wanna Be Studied Like
One Of Rob's Bugs Or Something...

44:27.597 --> 44:28.565
And I...

44:28.597 --> 44:30.199
And What?

44:30.233 --> 44:32.369
And I Don't Think
I Want It Explained.

44:32.402 --> 44:34.905
I Really Think There Are
Things In This World

44:34.938 --> 44:36.972
That We're Not Meant
To Understand.

44:40.476 --> 44:41.610
Forget It.

44:42.545 --> 44:43.512
Vicky, I'm--

44:43.545 --> 44:45.581
I'm Sorry, All Right?

44:45.614 --> 44:48.551
Look, Ok, Ok, Ok.
Look...

44:49.719 --> 44:52.021
I Didn't Mean To Make You
Feel Uncomfortable Yesterday.

44:52.054 --> 44:54.690
All Right? I Was...

44:54.724 --> 44:57.360
What Adam?
You Were What?

44:57.393 --> 45:00.630
Jealous, Ok?

45:00.663 --> 45:03.934
I Was Jealous.
That's All.

45:03.967 --> 45:06.001
I Mean, I Have
Studied Them For Years.

45:06.034 --> 45:07.937
I Could Write My Thesis
Tomorrow If They Would Let Me,

45:07.971 --> 45:10.072
But I Can't Do
What You Can, Vicky,

45:10.106 --> 45:13.577
And I Would Give Anything,
Anything To Be Able To.

45:13.610 --> 45:16.512
Why, So They Could Help You Write Your Thesis?

45:16.545 --> 45:19.348
Well, Yeah. I Mean,
I Have A Ton Of Questions For Them, But...

45:22.552 --> 45:23.653
All Right, Now, I'm Gonna
Sound Like A Freak,

45:23.686 --> 45:26.021
And--And--And Don't Laugh.

45:27.422 --> 45:29.291
At The End Of The Summer...

45:31.494 --> 45:33.329
I'd Really Like
To Say Good-Bye To Them,

45:33.362 --> 45:36.632
You Know, Just...

45:36.666 --> 45:40.202
Just Let 'Em Know How Much
I'm Gonna Miss Them.

45:40.235 --> 45:42.438
[Laughs]

45:42.472 --> 45:44.740
Well, Come On. You Said
You Weren't Gonna Laugh.

45:44.773 --> 45:47.443
It's Not That, Honest.

45:47.476 --> 45:49.245
It's Just...

45:49.278 --> 45:50.679
You Sounded
Kinda Human Just Then,

45:50.713 --> 45:52.983
And It Threw Me,
That's All.

45:56.518 --> 45:58.287
So We're Friends Again?

45:58.320 --> 46:02.192
Yeah, Sure. Friends.

46:02.224 --> 46:04.594
Cool. All Right, Well,

46:04.626 --> 46:06.496
I've Gotta
Get Back To Work.

46:06.528 --> 46:07.998
See Ya.

46:08.030 --> 46:09.231
See Ya.

46:16.572 --> 46:18.107
Hey, Suzy...

46:20.309 --> 46:23.445
Were You Serious About What You Said The Other Day?

46:23.478 --> 46:28.250
About Just Finding A Guy And, Boom,
Knowing He's The One?

46:28.284 --> 46:31.555
Well, I Don't Know If It'll Actually Go "Boom" Or Not.

46:31.588 --> 46:35.192
Come On, I'm Serious.
Help Me Out Here.

46:35.224 --> 46:36.458
I'm The Younger Sister.

46:36.492 --> 46:37.794
Why Are
You Asking Me?

46:37.827 --> 46:39.596
'Cause You're The Genius.

46:39.628 --> 46:43.567
Not About Boys.
Is It Adam?

46:44.766 --> 46:47.036
Zachary?

46:48.371 --> 46:49.706
Well, Who Do You Like
Being With More?

46:49.739 --> 46:51.041
I Don't Know.

46:51.074 --> 46:53.309
Adam Is So...

46:53.342 --> 46:54.710
Confident,

46:54.744 --> 46:58.515
So Sure Of What He's Gonna Do With His Life...

46:58.547 --> 47:02.218
And Zachary's Like
Being Out In A Storm:

47:02.251 --> 47:05.054
Exciting And Frightening
At The Same Time.

47:05.088 --> 47:09.793
Uh-Huh. Well, Uh,

47:09.826 --> 47:11.561
Let's Weigh The Evidence
Scientifically.

47:11.594 --> 47:14.097
If You're Going Strictly
On Physical Attributes,

47:14.130 --> 47:15.432
Zach Would Get My Vote.

47:15.465 --> 47:18.468
Adam's Nicer And Smarter,
But Marine Biologists

47:18.501 --> 47:20.537
Smell Like Fish And Formaldehyde All The Time.

47:20.570 --> 47:23.373
Of Course, Adam Has
A Plan For His Life.

47:23.405 --> 47:27.409
Zachary Doesn't,
But With All That Money, Who Needs It?

47:27.443 --> 47:28.778
If I Were You,
I'd Make A List.

47:28.811 --> 47:30.447
Pros And Cons
For Both Of Them

47:30.480 --> 47:32.148
With Appropriate
Plus And Minus Points

47:32.181 --> 47:34.251
For Degrees Of Importance.
Then Add 'Em Up.

47:34.284 --> 47:36.519
Thanks, Suzy.

47:36.552 --> 47:38.188
Glad To Be Of Help.

47:43.159 --> 47:46.162
And Here We Go.

47:49.699 --> 47:50.867
Thanks.

47:53.869 --> 47:56.205
So...

47:56.239 --> 47:57.340
I Heard You And Adam

47:57.373 --> 47:59.442
Sicked The Cops
On My Old Man.

48:01.376 --> 48:03.880
Good For You.

48:03.913 --> 48:06.181
You Guys
Still Fighting?

48:06.215 --> 48:08.518
Oh, We Never Fight, Vic.

48:08.550 --> 48:10.753
You See, Uh,
In Order To Fight,

48:10.786 --> 48:12.855
You Actually Have
To Talk To Each Other.

48:12.889 --> 48:16.559
You Know, Uh,
When I Was Growin' Up,

48:16.592 --> 48:18.327
My Parents
Were Always Weird

48:18.360 --> 48:20.195
Because They Never
Got Divorced,

48:20.228 --> 48:22.298
Which Was Mostly
Because They Thought

48:22.331 --> 48:25.868
It Would Be
Too Inconvenient...

48:25.902 --> 48:28.505
But When I Met Your
Parents Last Summer,

48:28.538 --> 48:32.141
I Mean, Not Only
Are They Not Divorced,

48:32.175 --> 48:33.843
But They Seem Like
They Loved Each Other.

48:33.876 --> 48:36.446
They Do.

48:33.876 --> 48:36.446
That's Wild, And I Mean,

48:36.478 --> 48:38.414
You And Your Family Talk About Just Everything,

48:38.447 --> 48:40.817
And You Go To Church,
And You Say Grace.

48:40.849 --> 48:43.420
I Mean,
I Don't Know Anyone Else Who Does That Kind Of Stuff,

48:43.452 --> 48:47.222
And Even Though
You Do All Of That,

48:47.255 --> 48:51.760
You're Still Real.

48:51.793 --> 48:54.364
Thank You?

48:54.396 --> 48:55.532
Woman: He's
Right Here.

48:54.396 --> 48:55.532
Oh, Uh,

48:55.565 --> 48:58.268
I Forgot To Tell You
I Have A Surprise Guest.

48:59.335 --> 49:00.737
Hi.

48:59.335 --> 49:00.737
It's Ok.

49:00.769 --> 49:01.838
I Invited Him
This Time.

49:01.871 --> 49:05.307
Ok, I'm--I'm Here.
What's This All About?

49:05.340 --> 49:09.578
So This Is How He Avoided The
Harbor Master The Other Day.

49:09.612 --> 49:12.349
About A Mile Out,
This Little Boat Gives Them The Nets,

49:12.382 --> 49:15.418
And, Uh,
Since You Two Are Playin' The Hardy Boys,

49:15.451 --> 49:20.657
I Thought, "Well,
With My Compliments."

49:20.690 --> 49:22.258
Look, I'm Sorry,
You Guys.

49:22.291 --> 49:23.626
These Aren't Enough,
All Right?

49:23.659 --> 49:25.461
We Have To Actually Catch Them Using The Drift Nets

49:25.494 --> 49:26.295
To Do Anything.

49:26.329 --> 49:31.735
Well, Uh, Maybe
That Can Be Arranged.

49:33.835 --> 49:35.838
Ok, Well, Look,

49:35.871 --> 49:38.207
This Is Boring.
Let's--Let's Go Dancing.

49:38.240 --> 49:40.242
Dancing? Where?

49:40.275 --> 49:42.411
Uh, We'll Take My Boat.
We'll Zip Over To The Mainland.

49:42.445 --> 49:44.514
I Know This Club
That's Totally Insane.

49:44.547 --> 49:47.516
Ok, But, Uh,
I Can't Be Back Too Late.

49:50.987 --> 49:52.521
Adam, Come On.

49:52.554 --> 49:55.224
Yeah, Adam,
Uh, Come On.

49:55.257 --> 49:56.925
No, I--I Don't Dance.

49:56.958 --> 49:58.961
Sure You Do.
Everybody Dances.

49:58.994 --> 50:00.262
Well, Not Me.

I Can't.

No, I Think You Can.

Reach Out And Call Them.

But What If
They Don't Come?

Have To Succeed,

55:20.648 --> 55:21.917
Did You Do It?

55:24.052 --> 55:26.822
Yeah,
I Think So.

55:30.059 --> 55:32.295
Why Do You Think
They Did It?

55:32.327 --> 55:34.563
Who?

55:34.597 --> 55:36.165
The Dolphins.

55:36.197 --> 55:38.600
Why Do You Think They Returned To The Sea?

55:41.269 --> 55:42.170
I Don't Know.

55:42.204 --> 55:45.141
And You Know, The Part
That Gets Me The Most

55:45.173 --> 55:47.844
Is That If You Look
At Their Flippers,

55:47.876 --> 55:50.947
They're Really Paws..
Fingers...

55:50.980 --> 55:52.248
Made Over With Skin.

55:52.280 --> 55:54.317
Guess When They
Returned To The Sea,

55:54.349 --> 55:56.752
They Had To Give Up
Their Hands.

55:56.786 --> 55:58.755
Wow.

55:58.788 --> 56:00.690
With No Hands,
There'd Be No Writing.

56:00.722 --> 56:02.791
Yeah. No Writing,
No Music,

56:02.824 --> 56:04.025
No Art.

56:05.927 --> 56:08.029
Do You Think When They Went Back To The Sea,

56:08.063 --> 56:10.298
They Had To Choose To Give Up Their Hands?

56:10.331 --> 56:12.969
That There Was Something So Worth It

56:13.001 --> 56:14.704
They Were
Willing To?

56:15.804 --> 56:17.373
I Don't Know.

56:17.405 --> 56:19.007
Maybe.

56:21.811 --> 56:23.246
Hey, Look!

56:32.221 --> 56:33.222
Ha Ha Ha Ha.

56:33.255 --> 56:36.024
Here.
Tell Them To Do Something With Your Mind.

56:36.057 --> 56:37.025
[Chattering]

56:37.059 --> 56:38.361
Go On. Tell 'Em.

56:50.239 --> 56:51.773
Th-Th-That Was Amazing!
What Did You Tell Them?

56:51.806 --> 56:53.942
I Told Them
To Do A Flip.

56:53.976 --> 56:55.878
Oh. Well, Do It Again.

57:00.715 --> 57:03.752
Ha Ha! That's Amazing.
Do It Again.

57:03.786 --> 57:04.854
No. He's Bored
With That.

57:04.887 --> 57:06.889
He Wants You
To Play With Him.

57:07.755 --> 57:09.157
Ha Ha Ha Ha.

57:11.260 --> 57:14.964
Ha Ha Ha. Whoa!
Ha Ha Ha! Yeah!

57:30.478 --> 57:33.048
Ha Ha Ha!

57:33.081 --> 57:34.349
Here, Talk To 'Em, Vicky.

57:34.382 --> 57:36.184
Ask 'Em A Question.

57:34.382 --> 57:36.184
[Chattering]

57:36.217 --> 57:37.185
Like What?

57:37.219 --> 57:40.789
Well, Ask Them About
What We Talked About Before,

57:40.822 --> 57:42.290
Why They Returned
To The Sea.

57:43.391 --> 57:44.759
Ok.

57:53.469 --> 57:54.804

Vicky, Are
You All Right?

58:18.527 --> 58:19.896
What Happened?

58:19.929 --> 58:20.896
I Don't Know.

58:20.929 --> 58:22.498
You--You Shouted
And Then Just

58:22.530 --> 58:24.467
Calmly Walked Back To Shore And Sat Down.

58:24.500 --> 58:26.268
Are You Ok?

58:26.302 --> 58:28.403
Yeah... Yeah.

58:28.436 --> 58:29.871
Where'd Enid
And Basil Go?

58:29.905 --> 58:31.240
They Left Back
To The Ocean.

58:31.273 --> 58:33.943
What Happened?

58:33.976 --> 58:35.378
They Tried
To Answer My Question,

58:35.411 --> 58:40.516
But... I Don't Think
I Could Understand It.

58:40.548 --> 58:42.951
It Was Like A Light...

58:42.985 --> 58:45.788
Stars Swirling Around
Each Other.

58:49.490 --> 58:51.460
I Don't Know, Adam,

58:51.492 --> 58:55.364
But The Dolphins Are Absolutely
Connected With Everything.

58:55.396 --> 58:58.534
Their Thoughts Are Totally Open To Each Other.

58:58.567 --> 59:00.936
They Have No Secrets.

59:00.969 --> 59:03.405
That Seems Kind Of Scary,
Don't You Think?

59:03.438 --> 59:06.975
At First, But Then,
There's This Incredible Freedom In No Secrets.

59:07.009 --> 59:09.445
You Can't Help
But Be Who You Are.

59:09.478 --> 59:11.547
That's Why It Was Worth It To Them To Return.

59:13.414 --> 59:15.183
No Secrets.

59:28.463 --> 59:29.831
Zach: Hey, Vic.

59:31.300 --> 59:32.468
What Are You
Doing Here?

59:32.501 --> 59:34.269
It's Time.

59:35.536 --> 59:36.504
Time For What?

59:36.538 --> 59:39.041
To Catch The Bad Guy.

59:40.041 --> 59:41.210
We'll Stay Back
Far Enough

59:41.242 --> 59:43.011

The <I>Marie Rose</I>

The Nets,

59:45.146 --> 59:47.415
We Zoom Up
And Get 'Em On Video.

59:47.449 --> 59:50.353
Ha. I'm Sure
It'll End Up On Tv.

59:50.385 --> 59:52.054
What About Adam?

59:52.086 --> 59:54.990
Hey, Just Because I Invited
Him To Dinner The Other Night

59:55.023 --> 59:57.292
Doesn't Mean I Want Him Around All The Time.

59:57.326 --> 01:00:00.128
Today's Adventure
Is Just You And Me, Vic.

01:00:00.161 --> 01:00:03.932
So Why Did
You Invite Him?

01:00:03.965 --> 01:00:05.201
To Give Him The Evidence.

01:00:05.934 --> 01:00:08.371

All Right, All Right.

01:00:08.403 --> 01:00:10.271

01:00:10.304 --> 01:00:11.606
About What?

01:00:11.639 --> 01:00:12.540
The Competition.

01:00:12.574 --> 01:00:16.244
Why Is Everything A Competition With Guys?

01:00:16.277 --> 01:00:17.545
It's In The Genes.

01:00:17.579 --> 01:00:19.347
We Can't Help It.

01:00:23.452 --> 01:00:28.024
So, That Adam
Is Pretty Serious, Huh?

01:00:28.056 --> 01:00:29.625
I Guess.

01:00:29.657 --> 01:00:30.458
You Guess?

01:00:30.492 --> 01:00:32.260
It's Like Hanging Out
With An Old Man.

01:00:32.293 --> 01:00:34.163
Why Are You Obsessing About Adam?

01:00:34.195 --> 01:00:37.199
I'm Not Obsessing.
I'm Just Making An Observation.

01:00:37.231 --> 01:00:39.534
He's Kind Of Dull,
That's All.

01:00:39.568 --> 01:00:41.570
He's Not Dull.

01:00:47.909 --> 01:00:49.444
Want To Have
Some Fun?

01:00:53.114 --> 01:00:54.182
What Are You Doing?

01:00:54.215 --> 01:00:55.550
Didn't You Ever
Play Chicken, Vic?

01:00:56.351 --> 01:00:59.054
No, And I Don't
Want To Start Now.

01:01:02.590 --> 01:01:04.125
Look Out!

01:01:05.159 --> 01:01:06.261
Stop It, Zachary.

01:01:06.295 --> 01:01:09.999
Don't Worry.
We'll Be Fine.

01:01:10.032 --> 01:01:11.033
Man: Make Way!

01:01:11.065 --> 01:01:14.102

I Mean It!

Ha Ha Ha Ha!

01:01:21.643 --> 01:01:23.445
I Told You.

01:01:23.478 --> 01:01:24.913
Take Me Back.

01:01:24.947 --> 01:01:26.347
What--Vic, I--

01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:28.183
Now!

01:01:32.721 --> 01:01:34.923
Vicky, Come On.
Let Me Explain.

01:01:34.956 --> 01:01:35.924
Explain What?

01:01:35.958 --> 01:01:37.159
That You Want
To Kill Yourself?

01:01:37.192 --> 01:01:38.693
Come On.
It Was Just Fun.

01:01:38.726 --> 01:01:39.694
I Was
Under Control.

01:13:19.127 --> 01:13:20.862
[Gasping]

01:13:20.895 --> 01:13:22.831
You've Almost Got It.

01:13:23.997 --> 01:13:26.033
I Almost Got It.

01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:28.969
It's Ok. Hang On.

01:13:29.002 --> 01:13:31.172
We're Almost There.

01:13:34.007 --> 01:13:36.310
Come On, Enid.
Please.

01:13:36.344 --> 01:13:37.679
It's Coming!

01:13:38.813 --> 01:13:40.748
You Got It.
You Got It.

01:13:46.119 --> 01:13:49.024
Both: Ha Ha Ha Ha.

01:13:51.125 --> 01:13:52.426
Adam!

01:13:53.795 --> 01:13:54.895
Adam?

01:13:54.929 --> 01:13:56.832
Wait! The Net!

01:13:54.929 --> 01:13:56.832
Adam!

01:14:04.171 --> 01:14:05.372
Vic, Gimme Your Hand.

01:14:07.708 --> 01:14:09.176
Watch Out.

01:14:09.210 --> 01:14:10.177
Are You In?

01:14:10.211 --> 01:14:11.179
Yeah.

01:14:11.212 --> 01:14:12.447
Adam!

01:14:12.479 --> 01:14:13.914
Adam!

01:14:52.287 --> 01:14:55.390
[Echolocating]

01:15:19.046 --> 01:15:21.081
Come On, Guys.
Come On.

01:15:28.957 --> 01:15:31.026
[Gasps]

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:33.395
Man, Don't Do
That To Me.

01:15:33.427 --> 01:15:37.064
Hand Me The Binoculars,
Will You, Rev?

01:15:43.805 --> 01:15:44.838
What Is It?

01:15:44.872 --> 01:15:46.041
We Got 'Em, Rev.

01:15:47.875 --> 01:15:49.077
Caught In The Act.

01:15:51.112 --> 01:15:53.882
Hey, Look.

01:15:51.112 --> 01:15:53.882
Adam: And There's
Somebody With Him.

01:15:54.916 --> 01:15:55.984
Get Mr. Gray On The Phone.

01:15:56.016 --> 01:15:58.420
He Is Not
Gonna Be Happy.

01:15:58.453 --> 01:16:00.355
Look!

01:16:01.555 --> 01:16:03.090
Ha Ha Ha!

01:16:04.492 --> 01:16:05.860
Vicky: It's Grandfather.

01:16:05.893 --> 01:16:09.831
Hey, Captain!
You're Busted!

01:16:09.863 --> 01:16:11.398
Yes! Ha Ha!

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:15.036
Both: Ha Ha Ha.

01:16:27.849 --> 01:16:30.251
They Spoke To You,
Didn't They?

01:16:30.283 --> 01:16:32.519
The Dolphins.

01:16:32.552 --> 01:16:34.956
Yeah.

01:16:36.356 --> 01:16:37.492
Just Once.

01:16:38.592 --> 01:16:42.463
Just For A Second.
They, Uh...

01:16:42.497 --> 01:16:44.865
They Told Me To Hold On,

01:16:44.899 --> 01:16:47.435
That I Had More To Do.

01:16:49.337 --> 01:16:51.106
I'm Glad.

01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:17.432
Rob: Vicky!

01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:17.432
Suzy: What Happened?

01:17:17.465 --> 01:17:20.135
Both: Vicky, What Happened?
What Happened?

01:17:20.167 --> 01:17:21.201
Yeah.

01:17:21.234 --> 01:17:23.203
Grandfather!

01:17:21.234 --> 01:17:23.203
Grandfather!

01:17:23.237 --> 01:17:24.204
Children, Wait A Minute.

01:17:24.238 --> 01:17:25.539
Vicky Will Tell You
What Happened,

01:17:25.573 --> 01:17:28.643
But I-I'm Gonna
Get A Nap.

01:17:28.676 --> 01:17:30.378
I Have
To Take A Nap.

01:17:30.411 --> 01:17:31.378
Vicky, What's Going On?

01:17:31.412 --> 01:17:32.213
What Happened?

01:17:32.246 --> 01:17:34.615
Ok, Ok. Calm Down, Guys.
Wait A Second.

01:17:40.287 --> 01:17:42.556
[Moans]

01:18:20.027 --> 01:18:22.697
Grandfather,
Would You Like Some Tea?

01:18:22.729 --> 01:18:25.532
V-V-Victoria?

01:18:25.565 --> 01:18:27.335
Ohh, Ohh.

01:18:27.368 --> 01:18:29.971
Grandfather?

01:18:30.003 --> 01:18:31.506
Come Here.

01:18:31.538 --> 01:18:33.041
I'll Call An Ambulance.

01:18:33.073 --> 01:18:34.241
No, Darling.
Come Here. Come Here.

01:18:34.274 --> 01:18:35.576
Come Here.

01:18:35.609 --> 01:18:41.515
It's... It's My Time.
Dear. I Know.

01:18:41.548 --> 01:18:42.716
You Never Should
Have Been Out There Today.

01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:44.252
This Is All My Fault.

01:18:44.284 --> 01:18:47.122
You Don't Know
What You Did For Me.

01:18:47.154 --> 01:18:50.358
You Gave Me One Of The Greatest Days Of My Life.

01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:51.492
Let Me Call A Doctor.

01:18:51.525 --> 01:18:52.493
No, Dear, No, No.

01:18:52.527 --> 01:18:54.628
Come Here.
Come Here, Closer.

01:18:54.662 --> 01:18:56.131
Closer.

01:18:56.163 --> 01:18:59.032
I Want To Tell You Something That's...

01:18:59.065 --> 01:19:03.570
That's... Important.

01:19:03.604 --> 01:19:06.740
You Have A Light,
Vicky,

01:19:06.774 --> 01:19:09.978
A Wonderful Gift.

01:19:10.011 --> 01:19:11.646
You Have
A Special Voice.

01:19:11.679 --> 01:19:13.480
Don't Ever Hide It.

01:19:13.514 --> 01:19:18.118
The World Needs All The Beauty It Can Get, Darling.

01:19:18.152 --> 01:19:19.753
Share It
With Everyone.

01:19:19.787 --> 01:19:21.222
Share It.

01:19:21.255 --> 01:19:22.556
Promise Me.

01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:24.458
I Promise.

01:19:24.492 --> 01:19:27.462
Don't... Don't Ever
Be Afraid, Dear,

01:19:27.494 --> 01:19:33.367
To Show
The Very Special...

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:35.135
Person That You Are.

01:19:35.168 --> 01:19:39.474
Don't Ever,
Ever Be Af...

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:02.089
Suzy?

01:21:38.458 --> 01:21:41.128
The Ferry's In.

01:21:41.162 --> 01:21:43.498
Your Parents Should
Be Here Any Minute.

01:21:47.234 --> 01:21:48.803
Thanks.

01:21:56.911 --> 01:21:59.180
[Sighs]

01:22:05.386 --> 01:22:06.554
Vicky?

01:22:07.954 --> 01:22:09.791
Think That There Could Be A Planet Somewhere

01:22:09.823 --> 01:22:11.925
Where Nobody
Has Any Eyes?

01:22:14.462 --> 01:22:16.864
Could Be, I Guess.

01:22:16.896 --> 01:22:18.432
Well, If Nobody
Had Any Eyes,

01:22:18.466 --> 01:22:19.834
They'd Get Along All Right Without Them,

01:22:19.867 --> 01:22:21.269
Wouldn't They?

01:22:21.301 --> 01:22:24.438
Sure.

01:22:24.471 --> 01:22:28.742
They'd Compensate With Hearing And Smell And Touch,
I Guess.

01:22:28.775 --> 01:22:31.845
But They Wouldn't Know What Anything Looked Like.

01:22:34.247 --> 01:22:37.551
No, It Wouldn't
Be Possible.

01:22:37.585 --> 01:22:40.253
I Was Thinking.

01:22:40.287 --> 01:22:43.291
When The People On The Planet With No Eyes Die,

01:22:43.323 --> 01:22:48.228
Turn To Planets
Where There Are Eyes.

01:22:48.261 --> 01:22:49.262
Maybe.

01:22:49.296 --> 01:22:51.231
So Maybe When We Die,

01:22:51.265 --> 01:22:53.368
We'll Get
Something New, Too,

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:56.436
Something As Important
As Being Able To See,

01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:58.606
But Since We Don't Know
What It Is,

01:22:58.639 --> 01:22:59.907
Nobody Could Tell Us
About It Now

01:22:59.939 --> 01:23:02.376
Any More Than We Could
Explain Seeing

01:23:02.409 --> 01:23:04.811
To The People On The Planet With No Eyes.

01:23:07.381 --> 01:23:10.218
I Think You're Right, Rob.

01:23:10.251 --> 01:23:11.418
[Car Approaching]

01:23:33.373 --> 01:23:35.777
Vicky, Come Here.

01:23:51.725 --> 01:23:53.694
Ok, Kids, Here We Go.

01:23:53.726 --> 01:23:55.630
Yeah, Thanks
For Everything, Dan.

01:23:55.662 --> 01:23:56.630
My Pleasure.

01:23:56.663 --> 01:23:59.533
You Got Great Kids.

01:23:59.567 --> 01:24:01.769
Ok, Guys.
Get All Of It.

01:24:05.405 --> 01:24:06.573
Hey, Vicky.

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:14.582
Thanks For Letting Me
Read 'Em.

01:24:14.614 --> 01:24:15.782
They're Great.

01:24:15.815 --> 01:24:19.653
Thanks, But, Um,
You're Prejudiced.

01:24:19.686 --> 01:24:21.354
Yeah, Maybe,

01:24:21.387 --> 01:24:24.591
But, Uh, I Still Think
They're Great.

01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:28.429
I've Decided
To Show Them

01:24:28.462 --> 01:24:30.665
To The Lit Magazine At School.

01:24:30.698 --> 01:24:33.401
What, The Old School
Or The New School?

01:24:33.434 --> 01:24:35.503
I Talked To Mom.

01:24:35.536 --> 01:24:38.372
I'm Not Going To
The New School.

01:24:38.404 --> 01:24:39.940
I Don't
Belong There.

01:24:46.814 --> 01:24:48.749
I Have To Go.

01:24:52.386 --> 01:24:54.355
You're Gonna Be
A Great Artist, Vicky.

01:24:55.221 --> 01:25:00.094
And You're Gonna Be
A Great Scientist.

01:25:00.127 --> 01:25:01.662
You Know,
Your Grandfather Always Said

01:25:01.694 --> 01:25:04.498
That Art And Science
Are Really One.

01:25:14.073 --> 01:25:15.509
Good-Bye.

01:25:18.779 --> 01:25:20.615
I'll Write.

01:25:23.716 --> 01:25:25.619
Good.

01:25:25.653 --> 01:25:27.954
So Will I.

01:25:45.538 --> 01:25:48.643
[Toot Toot]

01:25:59.619 --> 01:26:03.090
Grandfather: I Saw Eternity
The Other Night,

01:26:03.122 --> 01:26:07.694
Like A Great Ring Of Pure
And Endless Light,

01:26:07.728 --> 01:26:10.831
All Calm, As It Was Bright,

01:26:10.863 --> 01:26:12.532
And 'Round Beneath It,

01:26:12.565 --> 01:26:18.005
Time, In Hours, Days,
Years,

01:26:18.037 --> 01:26:22.609
Driv'n By The Spheres
Like A Vast Shadow Mov'd

01:26:22.643 --> 01:26:27.148
In Which The World,
And All Her Train Were Hurl'd.
