08:34.630 --> 08:37.430
Loose eyeball.
Zero entries.

08:37.510 --> 08:38.760
Okay, you know what?

08:38.850 --> 08:40.350
Let's find them.
Can you leave?

08:40.430 --> 08:41.770
-Yeah, but can you drive?

08:41.850 --> 08:43.180
-Yeah, I got my driver's
license when I was like 15.

08:43.270 --> 08:44.560
Come on.
-Okay, cool.

08:44.640 --> 08:45.940
Look, I know about five places
she could go.

08:46.020 --> 08:48.610
-Let's go.

08:48.690 --> 08:50.980
[ Crowd cheering ]

08:53.990 --> 08:55.950
-Beulah?

08:56.030 --> 08:58.410
Beulah?

08:58.490 --> 09:01.200
Somebody named Beulah order
a sock full of fries?

09:02.660 --> 09:04.620
I know.
It ain't right.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.870
They don't fill 'em up
like they used to.

09:06.960 --> 09:10.130
Used to be you could get fries
all the way down into the toes.

09:10.210 --> 09:11.590
Mm.

09:11.670 --> 09:14.220
-See you later, girl.
-Turner!

09:14.300 --> 09:16.340
Sergeant Turner!

09:16.430 --> 09:19.470
You out here serving the people,
girl?!

09:19.550 --> 09:20.680
-Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!
Shh!

09:20.760 --> 09:23.770
-Hey, Turner!
-Hey.

09:23.850 --> 09:25.810
Oh, uh, Keisha,
this my girl, Brenda.

09:25.890 --> 09:27.100
-What up, Keisha?

09:27.190 --> 09:30.230
-You Brenda Cole?!

09:30.310 --> 09:31.270
"Chicago Shields"!

09:31.360 --> 09:32.690
Hey, Nene!
Hey, Nene!

09:32.780 --> 09:34.320
-Keisha, shut the fuck up.
-Okay. Never mind, Nene.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.820
-No. No, thank you, Nene.
Damn, Keisha.

09:36.900 --> 09:37.820
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.160
-Hi.
My name is Keisha.

09:40.240 --> 09:41.870
Keisha Cole.

09:41.950 --> 09:43.870
I'm just kiddin'.
-Calm down, Thirsty.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.540
-I understand. You right.
My bad.

09:45.620 --> 09:47.000
-Thank you.

09:47.080 --> 09:49.500
-What y'all doing up here?
-Oh, um, well, you know...

09:49.580 --> 09:50.840
-Chillin'.

09:50.920 --> 09:52.210
-...me and Brenda,
we just taking the day off.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.670
Doing hoodrat things
with our friends.

09:53.750 --> 09:55.090
Gang gang.
-Gang gang.

09:55.170 --> 09:56.670
-Dang.
I am so jealous.

09:56.760 --> 09:59.260
-Keisha, we're gettin'
backed up on Sox fries.

10:02.350 --> 10:05.020
-And, um --
And that's why we, um --

10:05.100 --> 10:07.730
-She and I --
-That's why we came here,

10:07.810 --> 10:10.520
to tell you -- you,

10:10.600 --> 10:12.060
Big Momma died, girl.

10:12.150 --> 10:13.360
It was so sudden.

10:13.440 --> 10:14.690
So, unfortunately,
you gotta come with us

10:14.780 --> 10:16.440
right now to identify this body.

10:16.530 --> 10:18.110
-They had shot her up real bad.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.490
-Real bad. Arms.

10:19.570 --> 10:23.160
-Swiss cheese.
-Man, this city is savage.

10:23.240 --> 10:26.040
If it's a choice between grief
and nothingness,

10:26.120 --> 10:27.290
then I choose grief.
-Mm.

10:27.370 --> 10:29.000
-Mm.
-You're a beautiful man, boss.

10:29.080 --> 10:31.380
Thank you for your warmth
and compassion.

10:36.300 --> 10:37.340
-K-Keisha?

10:37.420 --> 10:38.630
Y'all got it?
-Yeah, we got it.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.180
We gon' take care of her, okay?

10:40.260 --> 10:42.550
We gon' take care of her.
-Oh, Brenda, you so pretty.

10:42.640 --> 10:45.680
-Fuck it up, fuck it up,
fuck it up.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.390
-So, that's how
that family does it?

10:48.480 --> 10:50.520
Respect. Next!

10:52.980 --> 10:54.570
-Thank y'all for coming
to book club.

10:54.650 --> 10:59.320
Today's book -- "Web of Stars,
Saga One, Quantum Tunnel."

10:59.400 --> 11:02.070
A story about Shaheer,
a lonely space miner

11:02.160 --> 11:03.780
stuck on a dead-end rock

11:03.870 --> 11:06.240
with dreams of being
a hero one day.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.080
-Thank you, Bluto.

11:11.170 --> 11:14.290
This is from Chapter 2,
"The Quickening."

11:14.380 --> 11:16.130
"You've got to shut down
those vents!"

11:16.210 --> 11:18.800
Karin shouted from
her vox implants.

11:18.880 --> 11:21.880
Shaheer stared at the
neophosphorescent plasma

11:21.970 --> 11:24.010
leaking all over the concourse.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.470
And then he froze.

11:25.550 --> 11:29.230
Froze like a goddamn megalovore
in a hydro-glacier.

11:29.310 --> 11:31.270
But then he got unfrozen.

11:31.350 --> 11:32.600
He got to work.

11:32.690 --> 11:35.440
-Bars!

11:35.520 --> 11:37.940
-Hearing your voice do it
brought the whole thing to life.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.280
I could actually see
the space leeches.

11:40.360 --> 11:43.320
I could feel them
sucking on my back.

11:43.410 --> 11:44.530
Their tendrils tickle.

11:44.620 --> 11:45.990
-Let me just go ahead
and dive in.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.740
I didn't like Shaheer's
"sub-human"

11:47.830 --> 11:49.290
identical doppelganger.

11:49.370 --> 11:51.460
I mean, he's evil, he's ugly,
his girlfriend

11:51.540 --> 11:53.460
is deeply unhappy
with his penis.

11:53.540 --> 11:56.340
Every fight he gets in to,
he gets the "green shit"

11:56.420 --> 11:57.840
beat out of him.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.380
A good villain is supposed to be
the hero of his own story,

11:59.460 --> 12:01.630
but this guy is
a disappointment to himself.

12:01.720 --> 12:05.550
I mean, his catchphrase is,
"Why am I so wack?"

12:05.640 --> 12:07.010
-Yeah.
It's like -- It's like the book

12:07.100 --> 12:08.970
was really trying
for something cool,

12:09.060 --> 12:10.640
and I-I was rooting for it.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.980
I was rooting for it to get
there, to get there, like...

12:13.060 --> 12:15.650
It just -- It just never
got there for me.

12:15.730 --> 12:18.400
-It's okay.
This is my first major novel,

12:18.480 --> 12:20.690
and I'm open
to constructive criticism.

12:20.780 --> 12:22.990
Steel sharpens steel.
-This is my third read.

12:23.070 --> 12:24.820
I'm -- I'm still seeing
new colors.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.620
Like, I didn't realize
till just now

12:26.700 --> 12:28.870
that it's the Dyson Sphere
on Blake's World

12:28.950 --> 12:30.910
that's powering
the tremor grenades.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.210
-Dude!
-Dude, those tremor grenades?

12:33.290 --> 12:34.580
So good.

12:34.670 --> 12:35.830
-Hey, babies, you look amazing.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.290
Get on in there, okay?

12:37.380 --> 12:40.130
-That's cute, though.

12:40.210 --> 12:41.460
-Hi.

12:41.550 --> 12:43.220
We'd like a table
for three, please.

12:43.300 --> 12:44.590
-Oh, we're a members-only club.

12:44.680 --> 12:45.840
-Oh, you must not know
who this is.

12:45.930 --> 12:47.180
-He must not.
He must not.

12:47.260 --> 12:48.220
-At all.
-Mnh-mnh.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.640
-Mnh-mnh.
-'Cause this is Sia.

12:50.720 --> 12:53.020
-Ha!
-Mm-hmm. Yep.

12:53.100 --> 12:55.810
-Um, so, no disrespect,
Miss Sox Sausages,

12:55.900 --> 12:57.690
but I'm afraid it is not.

12:57.770 --> 13:00.150
-Who is your manager?
-Well, Lisa is on break.

13:00.230 --> 13:02.360
I can help you.
But I don't have to help you

13:02.440 --> 13:04.150
because that is
obviously not Sia.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.240
-What?
-This ain't Sia?

13:05.320 --> 13:06.570
-No.
-Who is it then?

13:06.660 --> 13:08.530
-Well, Sia is Caucasian,
first of all.

13:08.620 --> 13:10.620
-Mm. They still spreading
those white lies?

13:10.700 --> 13:12.160
-White lies.
-You know what?

13:12.240 --> 13:15.710
-Here you go, ma'am.
-I can't -- I can't see that.

13:15.790 --> 13:17.040
-What?!
-Oh, hey, Tiffany.

13:17.120 --> 13:18.380
New hair, don't care.
Yes, gawd.

13:18.460 --> 13:19.840
-Bring it down.
Listen.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.210
You just one of them people
that believe

13:21.300 --> 13:22.550
anything you see
on the Internet, huh?

13:22.630 --> 13:23.710
-Absolutely, yes.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.510
-Well, it's all part
of our ruse, sir.

13:25.590 --> 13:26.880
-Mm-hmm.

13:26.970 --> 13:29.180
-It took us six years to find
the most perfect, basic,

13:29.260 --> 13:30.760
average-looking white lady.

13:30.850 --> 13:32.930
Her real name's actually Sarah,
and she's a nice chick,

13:33.020 --> 13:35.390
but Sia is not white, okay?
-Mnh-mnh.

13:35.480 --> 13:36.980
-Do you listen to her music?

13:37.060 --> 13:39.100
That is the voice of a powerful

13:39.190 --> 13:41.730
and strong, soulful
Black woman.

-I need a sec. Thank you.
[ Telephone rings ]
-I need a sec. Thank you.

13:43.230 --> 13:44.440
-Take two, take two.

13:44.530 --> 13:45.950
-Sosi House.
How can I help you?

13:46.030 --> 13:47.530
-Hello.
This is Russell.

13:47.610 --> 13:49.240
I need to speak
to Lisa immediately.

13:49.320 --> 13:51.120
It's urgent.
-Oh, well, Lisa's on break.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.660
I can help you, though.
-You don't get it.

13:52.740 --> 13:55.540
Fuck! Okay?
Just listen.

13:55.620 --> 13:58.500
I am the assistant
to Kate Furler.

13:58.580 --> 13:59.880
You may know her
by her stage name.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.290
It's Sia.
She's on her way

14:01.380 --> 14:03.750
to you right now,
and she's very temperamental.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.010
-Okay, well, in that case,

14:05.090 --> 14:06.590
we'll be happy
to accommodate her.

14:06.670 --> 14:09.090
Um, just so that I can
locate her immediately,

14:09.180 --> 14:11.100
could please you
describe her for me?

14:11.180 --> 14:14.850
-Sure, but keep it on the low,
but she Black.

14:14.930 --> 14:16.770
Light-skinned
but definitely Black.

14:16.850 --> 14:19.940

booty-out jumpsuit.

14:20.020 --> 14:21.770
-Uh, thank you so much,
Russell.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.940
-This here is one
of Brenda's spots.

14:27.030 --> 14:28.200
-Yeah?
-Sia!

14:28.280 --> 14:29.570
I am so sorry for the mix-up.
-Are you?

14:29.660 --> 14:31.240
-We're gonna give you
our best table.

14:31.320 --> 14:33.160
Uh, Marcus?
-Marcus? Unh-unh.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.450
-Uh, what name would you
like him to have?

14:34.540 --> 14:35.870
-Matthew.

14:35.950 --> 14:37.450
-Marcus, your name is Matthew
now. Get them a table.

14:37.540 --> 14:38.620
-Yeah.
-I'm so sorry.

14:38.710 --> 14:40.250
-And we order
two sets of wings.

14:40.330 --> 14:42.540
-Absolutely, yes.
-Lemon pepper side.

14:42.630 --> 14:44.090
-"Cheap Thrills"
was my shit, girl!

14:44.170 --> 14:45.880
-Thank God I paid the meter
just in time, I think!

14:45.960 --> 14:47.880
$12 for 8 minutes?
-Shit.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.130
-This is one of Brenda's spots.

14:49.220 --> 14:51.300
-Great.
-Oh, no, wait, wait, wait.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.300
It's members only,
and I'm not a member.

14:53.390 --> 14:56.470
-I'm a cop.
I'm a member of everything.

14:56.560 --> 14:59.480
Hey, hey!

14:59.560 --> 15:01.440
Uh, I need to get in here
right now.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.730
-Okay, do you have a --
a warrant?

15:03.810 --> 15:06.230
-Ha, warrant.
That's funny.

15:06.320 --> 15:07.480
Good band.

15:07.570 --> 15:08.650
"Cherry Pie," right?

15:08.740 --> 15:10.400
No, I don't have that, uh,

15:10.490 --> 15:12.870
but there are two women in here
who are fugitives from the law.

15:12.950 --> 15:15.030
So go ahead and let me in so
I can get that going, and --

15:15.120 --> 15:16.700
and everybody can be safer.

15:16.790 --> 15:19.040
Safer at the Sosi House.

15:32.260 --> 15:33.970
-Burgers?

15:36.220 --> 15:38.390
-Thank you, no, I'm straight.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.230
-I meant, are you in here
for the burgers?

15:40.310 --> 15:43.600
They have the
Au Cheval burger here.

15:43.690 --> 15:46.520
-Why are you here?
-Burgers.

15:46.610 --> 15:49.190
You'd think they'd let me in.
I am an alderman.

15:49.280 --> 15:52.780
But I guess that titles
don't matter here at Sosi House!

15:57.450 --> 16:00.790
-Listen, I am so sick of you
"Chicago Shields" extras

16:00.870 --> 16:02.330
sliding your greasy,
no-count asses in here

16:02.410 --> 16:04.460
pretending like you're CPD,
okay?

16:04.540 --> 16:05.880
-You consider me greasy?
-Yes, a little bit.

16:05.960 --> 16:07.130
-I just walked up
a lot of stairs, sir, okay?

16:07.210 --> 16:08.340
-Okay, I understand that.

16:08.420 --> 16:09.550
I didn't design
the building, sir.

16:09.630 --> 16:10.760
-I didn't love that word.

16:10.840 --> 16:11.840
And I don't think
an African-American,

16:11.920 --> 16:13.380
which I assume you are --

16:13.470 --> 16:14.890
or you could be Cuban,
perhaps Dominican, from Panama.

16:14.970 --> 16:16.550
-I'm African-American.
-African-American?

16:16.640 --> 16:17.970
-Yes.
-People from the South?

16:18.060 --> 16:19.180
-Yes.
-Guess what.

16:19.260 --> 16:20.640
My people are also
from the South.

16:20.720 --> 16:23.390
-I guess they don't care
about brothers

16:23.480 --> 16:24.900
being on the wall, either.

16:24.980 --> 16:27.900
Sad there ain't no brothers
on the wall.

16:27.980 --> 16:31.360
-I don't get it.

16:31.440 --> 16:34.320
-Uh, "Do The Right Thing"?

16:34.410 --> 16:37.320
-I'm sorry.
Is that a TV show?

16:37.410 --> 16:40.080
-No, it's -- it's a movie.

16:40.160 --> 16:43.040
-Who directed it?

16:43.120 --> 16:46.250
-Spike Lee.
-Oh.
