AND

00:36.751 --> 00:38.792
PRESENT

01:23.626 --> 01:27.542
THE OTHER SIDE OF HOPE

05:40.001 --> 05:42.876
<i>Oh mother, mother</i>

05:43.001 --> 05:47.417
<i>Turn up the lamplight</i>

05:48.167 --> 05:52.334
<i>I'll soon be dead</i>

05:52.459 --> 05:56.084
<i>Leave this gang behind</i>

05:56.209 --> 06:04.459
<i>Please buy me a fine white suit to wear</i>

06:05.042 --> 06:07.501
<i>For I'll soon be sleeping</i>

06:07.626 --> 06:15.042
<i>In the cold, dead ground</i>

07:05.459 --> 07:08.376
HOSTEL

10:17.167 --> 10:18.584
One seventy-one.

10:30.209 --> 10:32.292
Seventy-one.

11:42.709 --> 11:45.001
Peace.

11:46.834 --> 11:48.084
Khaled, from Syria.

11:48.209 --> 11:50.126
Mazdak, from Iraq.

12:19.709 --> 12:22.792
I got the cigarettes from him.

13:23.126 --> 13:26.292
- Thank you.
- Please come again.

14:10.542 --> 14:14.542
This is all I can take.
Times are bad.

14:15.334 --> 14:17.584
- Care for a coffee?
- Love to.

14:31.667 --> 14:36.584
I'd like to change my business.
Want to buy my stock?

14:36.709 --> 14:39.584
At half the price,
three thousand shirts.

14:39.709 --> 14:41.001
No can do.

14:41.126 --> 14:44.751
I'll quit myself next Christmas
and move to Mexico City.

14:44.876 --> 14:47.584
I'll drink sake and dance hula hula.

14:47.709 --> 14:51.792
I need action after
all this peace and quiet.

14:53.001 --> 14:55.459
What business were you thinking of?

14:55.584 --> 14:58.917
I've always liked restaurants.
Theoretically speaking.

14:59.584 --> 15:03.917
A profitable business.
People drink if times are bad.

15:04.042 --> 15:06.876
Even more if things go well.

15:07.584 --> 15:11.542
I guess we won't see each other again,
as I'll be going to Mexico.

15:38.001 --> 15:41.459
This is my fifth
Reception Centre in a year.

19:42.126 --> 19:45.459
I have four children.
Where are you from?

19:45.584 --> 19:47.042
Sweida, Syria.

19:59.751 --> 20:01.251
- Khaled Ali?
- Yes.

20:01.376 --> 20:03.334
Follow me.

20:05.751 --> 20:07.626
I'm a mechanic.

20:07.751 --> 20:11.751
I worked in a garage
on the outskirts of Aleppo.

20:13.251 --> 20:15.334
On 6th April last spring -

20:15.459 --> 20:17.584
when I returned from work -

20:17.709 --> 20:20.209
something had happened.

20:22.792 --> 20:29.417
When I arrived home,
it lay in ruins.

20:32.626 --> 20:34.584
I don't know who fired the missile.

20:34.709 --> 20:38.376
Government troops, rebels,

20:38.501 --> 20:41.626
USA, Russia, Hezbollah or ISIS.

20:45.376 --> 20:47.417
My sister Miriam arrived
at the same time.

20:47.542 --> 20:51.459
She'd been in the shop,
queuing for bread.

20:53.417 --> 20:58.709
We started to dig right away.
The neighbours helped.

20:58.834 --> 21:02.959
By morning we'd found my father,
my mother, my little brother,

21:03.084 --> 21:07.334
my uncle, his wife and their children.
They'd been eating lunch together.

21:09.542 --> 21:11.959
Next morning,
when we'd buried them,

21:12.084 --> 21:15.209
I borrowed 6,000 dollars
from my employer.

21:16.084 --> 21:19.876
My cousin drove us in a van
to the Turkish border.

21:21.001 --> 21:22.876
We crossed the border on foot.

21:23.001 --> 21:26.917
We were lucky -
there were no border guards.

21:27.584 --> 21:31.501
After two weeks, we paid
3,000 dollars to a smuggler.

21:31.626 --> 21:34.459
He took us to Greece in a boat.

21:34.584 --> 21:39.709
From there we walked
through Macedonia to Serbia.

21:39.834 --> 21:42.459
We arrived to the Hungarian border.

21:42.584 --> 21:46.876
There was a panic
and I lost sight of Miriam.

21:47.001 --> 21:49.834
I saw them close the border.

21:51.709 --> 21:54.167
Miriam remained on the other side.

21:54.292 --> 21:57.751
I tried to get back
through the police line.

21:57.876 --> 22:01.626
Two policemen grabbed me
and threw me down.

22:01.751 --> 22:05.542
They handcuffed me
and put me in jail.

22:07.334 --> 22:10.001
Did you experience violence?

22:12.209 --> 22:14.084
All the time.

22:14.626 --> 22:18.001
They tried to take
my sister three times,

22:19.709 --> 22:23.001
but good people helped us.

22:25.126 --> 22:28.834
Why did the garage owner give you
so much money?

22:33.417 --> 22:36.126
He's the father of my fiancée.

22:41.209 --> 22:42.917
Where is your fiancée now?

22:48.917 --> 22:51.917
She died at the beginning of the war.

22:58.459 --> 23:00.251
Continue.

23:00.917 --> 23:03.209
You were thrown into jail.

23:06.584 --> 23:10.376
I was beaten up,
but released after four days.

23:14.126 --> 23:17.626
I searched for my sister,
but I couldn't find her.

23:18.417 --> 23:22.584
I asked at all the refugee camps,
but no one knew anything.

23:27.501 --> 23:32.959
For two months, I went around Hungary,
Austria, Slovenia and Germany.

23:40.084 --> 23:44.917
I also went back to Serbia -
I thought she might look for me there.

23:50.459 --> 23:52.376
How did you get across borders?

23:54.667 --> 23:56.209
Easily.

23:57.709 --> 24:00.417
No one wants to see us.

24:02.209 --> 24:04.251
We cause problems.

24:07.251 --> 24:10.501
Didn't you apply for asylum anywhere?

24:13.126 --> 24:14.876
No.

24:15.626 --> 24:18.834
So I could move freely
looking for my sister.

24:23.959 --> 24:26.042
I know she's alive.

24:28.417 --> 24:29.667
I feel it here.

24:37.959 --> 24:40.501
Here's a photo of her.

24:47.042 --> 24:50.417
Write down her name
and her date of birth.

24:50.542 --> 24:52.792
Describe her as well as you can.

24:57.334 --> 24:59.251
We'll put out a search request for her.

25:00.751 --> 25:03.376
Would you like to take a break?

25:05.834 --> 25:07.792
Why?

26:30.001 --> 26:31.751
Give us a fag.

26:35.167 --> 26:37.626
Answer, arsehole.

26:37.751 --> 26:40.126
My fist your face, shithead?

26:59.167 --> 27:01.751
<i>See you again, camel driver!</i>

27:26.626 --> 27:28.542
The key to the storage hall.

27:28.667 --> 27:30.876
Let me know when it is empty.

27:31.001 --> 27:32.667
Right.

29:02.501 --> 29:05.084
Room for one more?

29:12.751 --> 29:14.709
Stud poker.

29:14.834 --> 29:16.292
Minimum bet one hundred.

29:16.417 --> 29:17.959
No limit.

29:44.084 --> 29:45.667
Pair of queens.

29:46.334 --> 29:47.876
Two pair.

29:49.417 --> 29:50.959
Pair of nines.

29:51.084 --> 29:52.209
And...

29:52.917 --> 29:55.584
Pair of tens.
Two pair high.

30:12.959 --> 30:15.001
Two hundred.

30:17.209 --> 30:18.834
Two hundred.

30:19.417 --> 30:20.709
Five hundred.

30:27.001 --> 30:29.001
I call.

30:48.001 --> 30:50.042
Pair of tens.

30:51.126 --> 30:52.751
Nothing.

30:53.667 --> 30:55.917
Pair of fivers.

30:56.042 --> 30:57.501
Nothing.

30:58.126 --> 30:59.917
One hundred.

31:00.626 --> 31:02.251
Enough for me.

31:03.001 --> 31:04.542
I call.

31:08.042 --> 31:10.209
Three tens.

31:34.751 --> 31:36.376
Goodbye.

31:49.584 --> 31:52.709
Why don't we end this game?

31:56.417 --> 31:59.001
How much do you have?

32:07.709 --> 32:10.917
Sixty thousand and small change.

32:12.001 --> 32:14.001
New deck.

32:20.626 --> 32:23.626
Six of clubs, ace high.

32:42.334 --> 32:45.084
Three of clubs, aces high.

32:55.084 --> 32:56.584
Two of clubs.

32:57.459 --> 32:59.584
Pair of aces still high.

33:08.751 --> 33:11.792
Five of clubs,
possible straight flush.

33:11.917 --> 33:13.834
Three aces.

33:43.417 --> 33:46.417
Four aces.
Straight flush wins.

34:13.708 --> 34:16.708
Don't come back.

34:16.833 --> 34:18.626
Don't worry. I won't.

34:53.458 --> 34:56.001
BUSINESS AGENCY

34:56.126 --> 34:57.667
- Wikström.
- Vaittinen.

35:00.751 --> 35:02.584
Here it is.

35:02.709 --> 35:06.751
Like I said, what we don't have
is not profitable.

35:33.001 --> 35:36.001
Debt-free restaurant business.

35:36.126 --> 35:39.001
Quite a good reputation.

35:39.876 --> 35:42.584
At one location only right now.

35:43.292 --> 35:47.709
Well, well.
Within walking distance.

35:48.501 --> 35:51.542
Restaurant Golden Pint.
An excellent name.

35:51.667 --> 35:53.334
Makes you thirsty right away.

35:57.167 --> 36:01.501
Quite affordable leasehold
at 1,400 per month.

36:01.626 --> 36:04.167
Two employees,
evidently competent-

36:04.292 --> 36:07.209
they come along as
long-standing employees.

36:07.334 --> 36:08.334
How much?

36:09.292 --> 36:11.876
Asking price is 30,000.

36:12.001 --> 36:16.917
Quite reasonable for a business
with an established clientele.

36:17.042 --> 36:21.251
If you get clean papers from
The Companies Register and the taxman,

36:21.376 --> 36:23.001
we'll go and have a look.

36:23.126 --> 36:25.084
I can do that within a minute.

36:25.209 --> 36:29.584
Good relations with the authorities
are the key to our business.

36:29.709 --> 36:34.376
For the Tax Office
I'm like a member of the family.

36:38.584 --> 36:40.876
THE GOLDEN PINT

36:41.001 --> 36:45.834
PLAT DU JOUR
Fillet of Herring

36:53.709 --> 36:55.876
Welcome, gentlemen.

36:58.334 --> 37:00.917
Please step in.

37:07.167 --> 37:09.209
Here again.

37:58.084 --> 38:02.376
- Do furnishings come with the deal?
- I think it can be arranged.

38:03.834 --> 38:05.667
It'll have to do.

38:05.792 --> 38:08.251
I'll pay 25,000.

38:08.376 --> 38:12.001
- I'll ask the owner if it's enough.
- I believe it is.

38:44.876 --> 38:49.001
Congratulations. You got a fine place
practically for free.

38:49.126 --> 38:52.042
It is a goldmine.
I'd never have parted with it,

38:52.167 --> 38:54.626
had I not been forced
to go on disability pension.

38:54.751 --> 38:58.876
Trouble with the spine.
A dab of paint and...

38:59.001 --> 39:01.376
- Without doubt.
- An excellent location.

39:01.501 --> 39:04.001
Many wealthy students
live in the area.

39:19.209 --> 39:22.292
- What about back pay?
- In your account by morning.

39:22.417 --> 39:24.501
You know me.

39:26.709 --> 39:29.876
I must cash the cheque first.

39:38.209 --> 39:40.334
To the airport.

39:48.001 --> 39:49.292
Your names.

39:49.417 --> 39:51.251
- Calamnius.
- Nyrhinen.

39:51.376 --> 39:53.626
Kolehmainen, Mirja.

39:54.376 --> 39:57.376
Who are the old employees
that come with the deal?

40:00.334 --> 40:01.334
We are.

40:02.667 --> 40:06.084
- What about you?
- A trainee. Unpaid, looks like.

40:06.626 --> 40:08.001
How much would you like?

40:08.126 --> 40:11.376
13,000 per month.
Plus the extras.

40:11.501 --> 40:16.626
Humour never hurts.
Union wages, whatever they are.

40:16.751 --> 40:18.959
How can we trust you then?

40:19.084 --> 40:21.209
We need a name, at least.

40:21.334 --> 40:24.334
- Wikström.
- What about a first name?

40:24.459 --> 40:26.834
- Plenty of Wikströms to go around.
- Waldemar.

40:27.542 --> 40:31.334
- Do your friends call you Wallu?
- I have no friends.

40:33.001 --> 40:34.876
Get to work.

40:47.459 --> 40:49.959
Today's lunch is meatballs
and boiled potatoes

40:50.084 --> 40:52.209
or pepper sardines.

40:52.334 --> 40:54.751
Sardines and a beer.

40:55.834 --> 40:57.834
Sardines.

41:29.709 --> 41:32.751
- That was quick.
- We have a Fusion Kitchen.

41:46.667 --> 41:48.917
Enjoy your meal?

41:49.042 --> 41:51.167
- Yes, I do.
- Good.

41:51.292 --> 41:54.501
<i>The rowanberries glow again</i>

41:54.626 --> 41:58.542
<i>Red as spilled blood</i>

41:58.667 --> 42:02.209
<i>Wedges of cranes have flown</i>

42:02.334 --> 42:06.459
<i>Away o'er my head</i>

42:06.584 --> 42:10.292
<i>Never took they me along</i>

42:10.417 --> 42:14.292
<i>To far-off lands</i>

42:14.417 --> 42:18.251
<i>Those without wings are bound</i>

42:18.376 --> 42:22.084
<i>To stand on this grey cold ground</i>

42:22.917 --> 42:26.876
<i>My sister is the night wind</i>

42:27.001 --> 42:30.501
<i>She sings me her songs</i>

42:31.001 --> 42:34.876
<i>And cold teardrops of the rain</i>

42:35.001 --> 42:38.876
<i>Beat against dark windowpane</i>

42:39.001 --> 42:42.751
<i>Many a traveller I see</i>

42:42.876 --> 42:46.667
<i>Hurry past my abode</i>

42:46.792 --> 42:50.501
<i>Once I waited for someone</i>

42:50.626 --> 42:53.584
<i>She will never come</i>

42:55.501 --> 42:58.542
Director. May I come in?

43:02.251 --> 43:04.292
I'm Calamnius. I'm at the door.

43:04.417 --> 43:08.126
I still remember you.
Sit down on the couch.

43:11.334 --> 43:12.876
I'm not one for bad talk,

43:13.001 --> 43:15.501
but as the shop steward I must tell you

43:15.626 --> 43:19.376
that the previous owner
was rather casual about pay.

43:19.501 --> 43:21.876
I see. How did it show?

43:22.001 --> 43:23.876
He didn't pay.

43:24.001 --> 43:28.251
For the last three months.
And some of us have a family.

43:28.376 --> 43:33.376
- You, too?
- I am a bachelor, by choice.

43:33.501 --> 43:38.459
- But for instance Nyrhinen has a mother.
- So you want an advance?

43:38.584 --> 43:40.876
Yes, if...

43:41.376 --> 43:43.084
All right.

43:43.209 --> 43:47.584
I'd be grateful if you didn't
mention this to the others.

43:49.167 --> 43:51.251
You can rely on me.

44:13.792 --> 44:15.376
Mazdak.

44:15.501 --> 44:17.792
May I use your phone again?

44:17.917 --> 44:19.709
How many times have I told you?

44:19.834 --> 44:23.334
Of course, any time you wish.

44:24.001 --> 44:26.876
I have to ask for another favour.

44:27.001 --> 44:29.167
May I give your number
to my cousin?

44:29.292 --> 44:31.459
So he can call me
if they find my sister.

44:31.584 --> 44:35.084
Of course.
Why do you even ask?

44:36.167 --> 44:38.626
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

44:43.042 --> 44:45.376
Hello. Hassaan?

44:45.501 --> 44:47.584
Hi, Hassaan.

44:47.709 --> 44:49.584
It's Khaled.

44:49.709 --> 44:50.959
Thanks.

44:51.084 --> 44:54.042
Tell me.
Has Miriam called?

45:01.667 --> 45:03.709
But how are you?

45:03.834 --> 45:06.751
Where are you, still in Aleppo?

45:13.001 --> 45:15.334
God help you.

45:19.834 --> 45:22.001
- Here.
- Any news?

45:22.126 --> 45:24.876
Nothing new, same old shit.

45:25.001 --> 45:29.042
My cousin and his family
have fled to the Turkish border.

45:29.167 --> 45:33.001
But they cannot cross it-
they've closed the borders.

45:33.126 --> 45:36.417
And no one knows about my sister.

45:41.001 --> 45:43.126
Shall we go to a bar?

45:43.251 --> 45:47.001
I'd like a beer
or whatever these unbelievers drink.

45:53.376 --> 45:56.501
That's a good shoemaker there.

45:56.626 --> 46:01.334
Fixes shoes well,
good with his hands.

46:02.084 --> 46:05.459
And up here -
not that one but over there -

46:05.584 --> 46:09.834
that belongs to
a friend of my cousin.

46:23.001 --> 46:25.126
What would you like?

46:25.251 --> 46:27.876
Two beers. Right away.

46:28.001 --> 46:30.792
- Now?
- Immediately!

46:33.876 --> 46:35.876
First round is on the house.

46:36.001 --> 46:38.709
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

46:38.834 --> 46:41.376
- Where can we sit?
- Anywhere.

46:57.501 --> 47:01.376
How well you speak Finnish.
What did you say?

47:02.334 --> 47:04.959
I ordered two beers.

47:05.084 --> 47:07.792
You were just like a local.

47:07.917 --> 47:10.667
God will hear you.

47:14.001 --> 47:17.501
<i>There was a field by the lake</i>

47:17.626 --> 47:21.042
<i>A cabin there with a hearth</i>

47:21.167 --> 47:24.876
<i>There was a field by the lake</i>

47:25.001 --> 47:28.084
<i>And a man in the field</i>

47:28.209 --> 47:31.667
<i>It was spring and May-time</i>

47:31.792 --> 47:35.209
<i>The trees all wore black</i>

47:35.334 --> 47:38.501
<i>Nothing else on his mind</i>

47:38.626 --> 47:42.917
<i>But to make the grain grow strong</i>

47:44.084 --> 47:47.501
<i>This land is a hard stony land</i>

47:47.626 --> 47:50.959
<i>And a land of long grey clouds</i>

47:51.084 --> 47:54.584
<i>Though the Lord shows mercy
on the ploughman</i>

47:54.709 --> 47:58.042
<i>This land never will</i>

47:58.167 --> 48:01.751
<i>This land is a hard stony land</i>

48:01.876 --> 48:04.959
<i>And a land of long grey clouds</i>

48:05.084 --> 48:08.417
<i>Though the Lord shows mercy
on the ploughman</i>

48:08.542 --> 48:11.417
<i>This land never will</i>

48:17.084 --> 48:20.459
<i>Tall fearless crop of corn did grow</i>

48:20.584 --> 48:23.209
<i>And the man in his mind</i>

48:24.251 --> 48:27.501
<i>Quietly blessed his fortune</i>

48:27.626 --> 48:31.001
<i>Never knowing what was to come</i>

48:31.126 --> 48:34.417
<i>There were many a cold night!</i>

48:34.542 --> 48:37.917
It rained all August through

48:38.042 --> 48:41.376
<i>All his work was washed away</i>

48:41.501 --> 48:43.917
<i>Wet corn gets frozen through</i>

48:44.584 --> 48:46.709
I think I'm going mad.

48:47.334 --> 48:48.959
Why?

48:49.084 --> 48:53.459
I've been here for a year already,
and I don't go forward or backward.

48:53.584 --> 48:55.542
I need a job.

48:57.209 --> 48:59.709
What did you do in Iraq?

49:00.417 --> 49:02.126
I was a nurse.

49:03.042 --> 49:05.084
But my papers are no good here.

49:05.209 --> 49:08.459
I cleaned a metro station
for two months.

49:09.334 --> 49:12.292
Two months, and that was it.

49:13.001 --> 49:17.001
I'd need three jobs anyway
to bring my family here.

49:20.459 --> 49:24.459
I bring no joy to anyone.

49:24.584 --> 49:26.876
I can't help myself
so I could help others.

49:28.251 --> 49:31.001
You seem happy and satisfied.

49:32.501 --> 49:33.959
I pretend.

49:34.084 --> 49:37.917
Those who are melancholy
are the first to be sent back.

49:38.042 --> 49:40.417
All melancholics are sent back.

49:40.542 --> 49:43.167
I'm too young to die.

49:43.292 --> 49:44.876
And I don't want to die yet.

49:45.001 --> 49:48.876
Even the Imam said I'm worldly.

49:49.001 --> 49:51.459
Even the Imam!

49:52.376 --> 49:54.167
That's what saved me.

49:54.292 --> 49:59.001
When they raided my home to get me,
I was in town.

50:00.709 --> 50:05.501
In the morning,
I packed my bags and ran.

50:08.709 --> 50:13.042
Should I pretend and smile, too?

50:13.167 --> 50:17.126
Yes! Yes! It will help.

50:17.251 --> 50:20.501
Just don't smile in the street,
they might think you're crazy.

50:20.626 --> 50:23.876
You'll get into trouble.

50:24.001 --> 50:26.876
You confuse me.
Should I smile or cry?

50:28.126 --> 50:30.167
You'll understand later.

50:31.876 --> 50:34.209
What is your religious denomination?

50:36.001 --> 50:38.959
Are you a Sunni, a Shia, an Alawite...

50:41.334 --> 50:44.376
I buried the Prophet
and all gods along my family.

50:47.167 --> 50:49.459
I'll write down "an atheist."

50:52.292 --> 50:55.584
Whatever you want.
But I'm not that, either.

50:56.542 --> 50:58.751
I'll write down "no religion."

51:01.001 --> 51:02.751
Why did you want to come to Finland?

51:04.292 --> 51:06.001
I didn't.

51:06.126 --> 51:08.792
In the Polish city of Gdansk,

51:08.917 --> 51:13.959
skinhead Nazis attacked me
in front of the port.

51:14.084 --> 51:17.501
I had to run away.
I hid aboard a cargo ship.

51:18.376 --> 51:20.042
I was tired and fell asleep.

51:20.167 --> 51:22.876
When I woke up the ship
was already at sea.

51:23.001 --> 51:24.917
A sailor found me.

51:25.042 --> 51:27.917
He was a good man,
he didn't tell the Captain.

51:28.417 --> 51:31.209
He brought me food and drink.

51:31.334 --> 51:34.459
Later he told me the ship
was bound for Finland.

51:35.292 --> 51:37.959
When I asked him about Finland,

51:38.084 --> 51:40.917
he said it was a good country
with equality for all.

51:41.042 --> 51:44.459
That the Finns have had
their own war.

51:44.584 --> 51:46.876
That you've had
your own refugees.

51:47.001 --> 51:50.251
And you will never forget it, never.

51:50.376 --> 51:53.417
Above all, this is a good country
with good people.

51:55.667 --> 51:57.459
What did you think?

51:58.459 --> 51:59.834
I thought I was really lucky.

52:01.167 --> 52:02.376
And now?

52:03.542 --> 52:05.709
This is a country with no war.

52:05.834 --> 52:07.751
I want to stay here.

52:07.876 --> 52:10.334
Learn the language. Find a job.

52:11.084 --> 52:13.626
Find my sister and bring her here, too.

52:13.751 --> 52:16.334
To make sure she has a future.

52:18.459 --> 52:20.376
What about yourself?

52:22.876 --> 52:24.917
I don't matter.

52:32.917 --> 52:34.917
I'll let you know
if I hear about her.

52:35.042 --> 52:38.126
God willing. Thanks.

53:46.209 --> 53:51.501
Considering the development
in Aleppo's security situation,

53:52.042 --> 53:55.584
the number of acts of violence
and deaths

53:55.709 --> 53:58.209
in relation to Aleppo's
large number of inhabitants,

53:58.334 --> 54:02.501
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
considers that in the Aleppo region

54:02.626 --> 54:05.792
there is no such conflict to cause

54:05.917 --> 54:10.917
all the residents of the city

54:11.042 --> 54:14.417
any serious personal danger
described as grievous harm

54:14.542 --> 54:22.542
in paragraph 88, subsection 1
of the Aliens Act.

54:23.459 --> 54:27.501
Considering the security situation
in Aleppo, your domicile

54:27.626 --> 54:30.209
and your personal circumstances,

54:30.334 --> 54:33.126
you require no subsidiary protection.

54:33.251 --> 54:36.292
You will be flown tomorrow
at the expense of the Republic of Finland

54:36.417 --> 54:38.042
to Ankara in Turkey.

54:38.167 --> 54:41.584
Turkish authorities will assist you
to the Syrian border.

54:41.709 --> 54:44.876
You will now be escorted back
to the Reception Centre.

54:45.001 --> 54:50.792
You may not leave it until you're taken
to the airport tomorrow morning.

54:50.917 --> 54:53.084
You have no right
to appeal against this decision.

55:02.001 --> 55:04.001
Next one.

55:25.126 --> 55:27.751
He'll be repatriated tomorrow.
See that he stays inside.

55:27.876 --> 55:29.834
He'll stay here.

55:32.542 --> 55:36.251
<i>News from abroad. The UN considers
the situation in Syria alarming.</i>

55:36.376 --> 55:40.917
<i>Increased fighting has claimed
several victims during the past 24 hours.</i>

55:41.042 --> 55:43.626
<i>Yesterday Syrian troops
made a bloody strike</i>

55:43.751 --> 55:46.376
<i>against a children's hospital in Aleppo.</i>

55:46.834 --> 55:49.584
<i>This is what a very fragile
cease-fire looks like.</i>

55:49.709 --> 55:53.251
<i>The fighting between
Syrian troops and the rebels</i>

55:53.376 --> 55:57.209
<i>has already claimed 61 victims
during Wednesday and Thursday.</i>

55:58.334 --> 55:59.959
<i>One of the most devastating strikes</i>

56:00.084 --> 56:02.542
<i>was made against
a children's hospital in Aleppo.</i>

56:03.251 --> 56:07.584
<i>The Syrian government air strike
claimed 27 victims.</i>

56:07.709 --> 56:09.334
<i>The UN says that relief deliveries</i>

56:09.459 --> 56:12.209
<i>will become more difficult
should the fighting continue.</i>

56:12.792 --> 56:14.459
<i>The cease-fire came and went.</i>

56:14.584 --> 56:17.084
<i>The destruction of Aleppo
continues without pause.</i>

56:17.584 --> 56:20.209
<i>Supported by Russia,
the Syrian Army has hammered</i>

56:20.334 --> 56:23.792
<i>at the rebel-controlled
Eastern Aleppo for days.</i>

56:23.917 --> 56:28.959
<i>Everything is in short supply:
food, fuel, medicine.</i>

56:29.084 --> 56:31.876
<i>History at least will condemn
the infamous killing</i>

56:32.001 --> 56:35.209
<i>now going on in Syria
for more than five years.</i>

56:35.334 --> 56:38.292
<i>Random bombing of civilians
with incendiaries</i>

56:38.417 --> 56:41.251
<i>and especially effective
bunker-buster bombs</i>

56:41.376 --> 56:44.167
<i>is now considered a war crime.</i>

57:01.709 --> 57:04.376
Here's the number of Hassaan,
my cousin.

57:05.001 --> 57:09.667
Just in case, if you happen
to holiday in our area.

57:10.417 --> 57:13.959
I'll call you when I get a phone.

57:14.459 --> 57:16.626
God willing, Khaled.

57:21.376 --> 57:23.251
Khaled.

57:23.376 --> 57:26.501
Could you play a little?
I'm feeling low.

57:35.334 --> 57:38.126
Excuse me.
May I borrow your instrument?

57:38.251 --> 57:40.626
Can you play it?

57:40.751 --> 57:42.459
Please.

59:30.792 --> 59:32.834
Transfer to the airport.

59:33.709 --> 59:36.376
He's taking a shower.
Some coffee while you wait?

59:36.501 --> 59:38.292
Yes, please.

01:00:09.834 --> 01:00:11.917
<i>I play</i>

01:00:12.626 --> 01:00:15.001
<i>Or I die</i>

01:00:15.834 --> 01:00:17.626
<i>I play</i>

01:00:18.501 --> 01:00:21.084
<i>Don't wonder why</i>

01:00:21.209 --> 01:00:23.751
<i>If I'm lucky</i>

01:00:23.876 --> 01:00:26.501
<i>This business works</i>

01:00:27.459 --> 01:00:29.709
<i>But he never plays</i>

01:00:30.542 --> 01:00:32.292
<i>Who's afraid</i>

01:00:45.292 --> 01:00:47.876
<i>I can sail</i>

01:00:48.001 --> 01:00:50.251
<i>Away from the city</i>

01:00:51.417 --> 01:00:55.334
<i>To Gambia or Venezuela</i>

01:00:57.376 --> 01:01:01.709
<i>But you'll never get Sörkka out of me</i>

01:01:03.251 --> 01:01:05.751
<i>Even when</i>

01:01:06.501 --> 01:01:08.626
<i>I die</i>

01:01:09.792 --> 01:01:11.834
<i>I play</i>

01:01:12.459 --> 01:01:14.792
<i>Or I die</i>

01:01:15.501 --> 01:01:18.126
<i>I play</i>

01:01:18.251 --> 01:01:20.001
<i>Don't wonder why</i>

01:01:20.834 --> 01:01:23.667
<i>If I'm lucky</i>

01:01:23.792 --> 01:01:26.501
<i>The systems work</i>

01:01:27.167 --> 01:01:29.417
<i>But he never plays</i>

01:01:30.167 --> 01:01:33.001
<i>Who's afraid</i>

01:01:57.042 --> 01:01:59.292
<i>I'll hang around here</i>

01:01:59.417 --> 01:02:01.334
<i>As long as</i>

01:02:02.417 --> 01:02:05.167
<i>The Station clock</i>

01:02:05.292 --> 01:02:08.042
<i>In its tower ticks</i>

01:02:08.876 --> 01:02:11.084
<i>I'll be swinging here</i>

01:02:11.209 --> 01:02:14.084
<i>As long as</i>

01:02:14.209 --> 01:02:16.376
<i>The number seven tram</i>

01:02:16.501 --> 01:02:19.209
<i>Rolls down its tracks</i>

01:02:20.834 --> 01:02:23.542
<i>I play</i>

01:02:23.667 --> 01:02:26.292
<i>Or I die...</i>

01:02:41.501 --> 01:02:43.417
A better idea.

01:02:49.626 --> 01:02:50.792
Hot dog.

01:02:59.751 --> 01:03:02.417
Go to hell, jerks.

01:03:02.542 --> 01:03:05.001
Next time, you'll die.

01:03:28.292 --> 01:03:30.501
What's the matter with you?

01:03:45.501 --> 01:03:48.167
What's that?

01:03:50.417 --> 01:03:53.001
That's Koistinen.

01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:55.584
Get it out of here.

01:03:55.709 --> 01:03:58.584
You have until tomorrow.

01:04:25.959 --> 01:04:27.501
Who might you be?

01:05:09.792 --> 01:05:11.917
A sorry tale Kale has to tell.

01:05:12.042 --> 01:05:13.667
What do we do about him?

01:05:13.792 --> 01:05:17.042
Won't last long in the street
with that frame.

01:05:17.167 --> 01:05:21.042
Managed to surprise me.
Dropped him, though.

01:06:16.376 --> 01:06:19.626
Could've turned the freezer off.

01:06:19.751 --> 01:06:22.667
But he won't fit,
not even sideways.

01:06:22.792 --> 01:06:27.709
He can't live here anyway.
I need my peace and quiet too.

01:06:27.834 --> 01:06:31.209
Am I a nature's freak
that won't long for privacy?

01:06:31.334 --> 01:06:35.417
Don't I bleed and die
when I am poisoned?

01:06:35.542 --> 01:06:38.209
Am I the least of the least?

01:06:38.334 --> 01:06:42.667
And what does that make of me?
You being the director.

01:06:42.792 --> 01:06:45.292
At least you know your place.

01:08:08.917 --> 01:08:10.334
Razzia.

01:08:10.459 --> 01:08:13.001
I understand. Action.

01:08:48.959 --> 01:08:50.042
You can open now.

01:08:57.001 --> 01:09:00.292
Welcome, but we won't open until nine.

01:09:00.417 --> 01:09:02.876
There's coffee if you care to wait.

01:09:03.001 --> 01:09:05.417
Lunch will be served at eleven.

01:09:05.542 --> 01:09:08.959
Dish of the day is
fishballs à la maison.

01:09:09.084 --> 01:09:11.292
Area Control Centre.

01:09:11.417 --> 01:09:14.001
We will also do a fire inspection.

01:09:14.126 --> 01:09:17.459
Identification papers for everyone,
refrigeration control report.

01:09:17.584 --> 01:09:21.501
I believe the Fire Chief will want to see
the emergency exits.

01:09:22.834 --> 01:09:26.209
Our customers seldom want
to leave once they're in.

01:09:28.376 --> 01:09:30.001
Wikström.

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:34.959
Nice to meet you.
We haven't met before.

01:09:35.084 --> 01:09:37.126
I've just bought the place.

01:09:37.251 --> 01:09:40.876
I haven't had the opportunity
to meet the authorities concerned.

01:09:41.917 --> 01:09:46.209
But my staff is up to date.
Care to have something?

01:09:46.334 --> 01:09:51.209
Thank you, but let's handle
the official business first.

01:10:14.376 --> 01:10:16.459
Identity papers.

01:10:16.584 --> 01:10:21.001
- The law says a Finnish citizen won't...
- You look like a foreigner.

01:10:29.042 --> 01:10:31.251
Can I bring them later?

01:10:51.792 --> 01:10:52.917
Tolerable.

01:10:53.042 --> 01:10:56.626
We just have to rebuild
the dining hall and the kitchen.

01:10:59.084 --> 01:11:01.751
It's soon nine o'clock.
Guess we should open.

01:11:01.876 --> 01:11:05.209
- What about Khaled?
- What about him?

01:11:05.334 --> 01:11:10.126
- Can we let him out now?
- Sure. I forgot all about the guy.

01:11:39.584 --> 01:11:43.126
Kale needs papers, legal or illegal.

01:11:44.126 --> 01:11:46.667
Can't keep the doors locked,
business will suffer.

01:11:47.334 --> 01:11:50.084
Let's throw Kale out
and go on as before.

01:11:50.209 --> 01:11:51.459
Let's throw you out.

01:11:52.417 --> 01:11:54.042
That wouldn't solve the problem.

01:11:56.167 --> 01:11:58.834
My nephew is a genius.

01:11:58.959 --> 01:12:01.292
Seems to run in the family.

01:12:01.417 --> 01:12:06.792
With computers. He'll slog out
an identity for Kale in 15 minutes.

01:12:06.917 --> 01:12:09.042
Ask him here.

01:12:12.251 --> 01:12:14.417
Can you do it?

01:12:14.542 --> 01:12:18.792
Like taking candy from a kid.
How much do I net?

01:12:20.209 --> 01:12:23.959
- Not much.
- A grand.

01:12:24.084 --> 01:12:26.792
It buys him a history
back to the Invasion of Normandy.

01:12:26.917 --> 01:12:28.209
He's not that old.

01:12:28.876 --> 01:12:31.667
The fee's the same
even if he's born tomorrow.

01:12:31.792 --> 01:12:34.542
Done.
What do you call yourself?

01:12:35.501 --> 01:12:37.834
Winston will have to do.

01:12:38.459 --> 01:12:40.834
- When can you begin?
- Immediately.

01:13:22.251 --> 01:13:26.084
The Civil Registry security
is not just pathetic, it's non-existent.

01:13:56.042 --> 01:13:58.001
That's the best I can do.

01:13:58.126 --> 01:14:00.084
Khalid Hussein was granted asylum -

01:14:00.209 --> 01:14:02.959
residence and work permits
last October.

01:14:03.084 --> 01:14:05.584
Bucks on the table.

01:14:11.126 --> 01:14:13.126
We could make you younger, too.

01:14:13.251 --> 01:14:17.001
- At least on paper.
- Get lost.

01:14:34.126 --> 01:14:35.751
Identity papers, please.

01:14:49.626 --> 01:14:52.292
Routine check. Have a nice day.

01:14:52.417 --> 01:14:54.417
You, too.

01:15:05.001 --> 01:15:06.542
Mazdak.

01:15:06.667 --> 01:15:08.042
Khaled!

01:15:08.167 --> 01:15:09.417
How are you?

01:15:09.542 --> 01:15:11.167
Good. I can't stay for long.

01:15:11.292 --> 01:15:13.709
- Has anyone asked for me?
- Just the police.

01:15:13.834 --> 01:15:16.167
Has Hassaan called?
Anything about my sister?

01:15:16.292 --> 01:15:18.626
Nothing.
But I told everyone here.

01:15:18.751 --> 01:15:22.042
If anyone hears anything,
they will tell me.

01:15:22.167 --> 01:15:23.709
But where do you live now?

01:15:23.834 --> 01:15:26.876
I work at a restaurant called
The Golden Pint.

01:15:27.001 --> 01:15:30.626
- Wonderful!
- Listen. I fell in love with Finland.

01:15:30.751 --> 01:15:35.626
But if you find a way out of here
I'd be really grateful.

01:15:36.792 --> 01:15:37.917
God willing.

01:15:38.042 --> 01:15:40.042
I don't know how to thank you.

01:15:40.167 --> 01:15:43.042
- Take care.
- Take care of yourself.

01:15:55.376 --> 01:15:59.251
Business is not too good,
considering the processes.

01:15:59.376 --> 01:16:01.834
I think we're doing good.

01:16:04.209 --> 01:16:07.209
Mr Director, forgive me for asking.

01:16:07.334 --> 01:16:10.876
Have you considered dance music
as part of our operating strategy?

01:16:11.001 --> 01:16:13.667
A brilliant idea.
ls that what you'd do?

01:16:13.792 --> 01:16:15.501
Absolutely.

01:16:16.834 --> 01:16:19.167
Then we should consider it.

01:16:19.292 --> 01:16:22.084
I think Calamnius talks sense.

01:16:22.209 --> 01:16:25.376
And we couldn't go any lower
even if we tried.

01:16:25.501 --> 01:16:29.251
Beer sells well,
other sales are negligible.

01:16:29.376 --> 01:16:32.626
We need to develop the food side.

01:16:32.751 --> 01:16:34.292
Why?

01:16:36.626 --> 01:16:39.292
What would be trendy?

01:16:39.417 --> 01:16:42.709
Sushi. Absolutely.

01:16:42.834 --> 01:16:44.917
My cousin runs a sushi restaurant.

01:16:45.042 --> 01:16:48.209
Is that why you ended up here?

01:16:48.334 --> 01:16:52.084
I asked him.
A favour for a friend.

01:16:52.209 --> 01:16:56.167
- Couldn't do any worse?
- Not at the time.

01:18:35.501 --> 01:18:37.584
Welcome.

01:18:49.209 --> 01:18:51.001
Please.

01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:17.751
What would you like?

01:19:17.876 --> 01:19:21.001
Four Sushi Platters.

01:19:36.834 --> 01:19:38.417
We're out of miso soup.

01:19:38.542 --> 01:19:42.001
Use cabbage.
Any mushroom will do.

01:19:44.292 --> 01:19:46.501
Twenty Nigiri Sushi Platters.

01:19:46.626 --> 01:19:48.292
- Director.
- Yes?

01:19:48.834 --> 01:19:50.542
We're out of salmon,
Whitefish too.

01:19:51.376 --> 01:19:53.209
Already? How much did you buy?

01:19:53.334 --> 01:19:56.251
Half a kilo of both.
I never guessed...

01:19:59.876 --> 01:20:03.459
Give sake to everyone,
on the house.

01:20:05.792 --> 01:20:07.167
What do we have?

01:20:07.292 --> 01:20:08.959
Meatballs won't do.

01:20:22.751 --> 01:20:25.709
SALTED HERRING

01:20:25.834 --> 01:20:28.709
- I was saving this for the summer.
- Since when?

01:20:28.834 --> 01:20:32.584
- Wasabi will hide the taste of salt.
- Get on it then.

01:21:15.626 --> 01:21:19.626
You go home.
I'll clean up myself.

01:22:00.126 --> 01:22:02.209
PLAT DU JOUR

01:22:02.334 --> 01:22:05.209
MEATBALLS 8€
FISHBALLS WITH SAUCE 9,50€

01:22:07.709 --> 01:22:11.792
<i>In the dusky evening shade</i>

01:22:11.917 --> 01:22:16.001
<i>Again I and my longing stay</i>

01:22:16.126 --> 01:22:18.959
<i>Much did the day bring</i>

01:22:19.084 --> 01:22:24.417
<i>Still it now feels wasted</i>

01:22:24.542 --> 01:22:28.126
<i>The quiet tune of a memory</i>

01:22:28.792 --> 01:22:32.001
<i>Plays longingly in my soul</i>

01:22:33.084 --> 01:22:35.876
<i>Reminding me of the past</i>

01:22:36.001 --> 01:22:42.001
<i>And how you went away, my love</i>

01:22:42.626 --> 01:22:46.876
<i>Wherever, whenever</i>

01:22:47.001 --> 01:22:50.876
<i>My little darling goes</i>

01:22:51.001 --> 01:22:53.334
<i>I hear the whisper</i>

01:22:53.459 --> 01:22:55.417
<i>Of the evening wind</i>

01:22:55.542 --> 01:22:59.251
<i>Consoling, caressing me</i>

01:22:59.376 --> 01:23:03.709
<i>Astray out there on the cold trail</i>

01:23:03.834 --> 01:23:07.667
<i>My darling you will go</i>

01:23:07.792 --> 01:23:12.126
<i>My soul is yearning,
hoping that my love will come...</i>

01:23:33.292 --> 01:23:36.167
- What's up, Chef Khaled?
- How are you, brother?

01:23:36.292 --> 01:23:39.001
Well, thank you.
A wonderful job!

01:23:40.626 --> 01:23:42.001
Guess what?

01:23:42.126 --> 01:23:45.667
Hassaan called 15 minutes ago.
Your sister's been found.

01:24:46.167 --> 01:24:49.251
That's all right.
When should I go?

01:24:49.376 --> 01:24:52.792
As soon as possible.
Situations keep changing.

01:24:52.917 --> 01:24:57.709
I need a load, at least to Lithuania.
Or it'll look odd.

01:24:57.834 --> 01:25:00.001
How will the girl trust me?

01:25:07.876 --> 01:25:10.334
An address wouldn't hurt.

01:26:28.001 --> 01:26:31.292
Nothing in the back.
Didn't get a return load.

01:26:31.417 --> 01:26:33.084
Open it anyway.

01:26:55.084 --> 01:26:57.709
OK, you can go.

01:27:26.751 --> 01:27:28.667
Miriam.

01:27:28.792 --> 01:27:30.209
Khaled.

01:27:49.251 --> 01:27:52.792
Thank you for this.
What do I owe you?

01:27:52.917 --> 01:27:55.042
I took a fine load there.

01:27:55.167 --> 01:27:57.709
I won't take money for this.

01:28:19.459 --> 01:28:22.126
I was worried about you.

01:28:22.251 --> 01:28:24.876
Why should I lie?

01:28:25.001 --> 01:28:27.626
I've been a nervous wreck.

01:28:27.751 --> 01:28:30.792
I wrecked my nerves trying
to think of how to help you.

01:28:33.167 --> 01:28:36.501
I was lost,
but good people helped me.

01:28:36.626 --> 01:28:40.376
A family from Afghanistan
practically adopted me.

01:28:40.501 --> 01:28:44.334
Although I'm older
than any of their seven children.

01:28:45.709 --> 01:28:46.709
Miriam.

01:28:50.542 --> 01:28:53.876
We're the only ones left
of our family.

01:28:54.001 --> 01:28:57.334
I hope you can bear it.

01:28:57.459 --> 01:29:01.501
Don't worry,
I'm my mother's daughter.

01:29:01.626 --> 01:29:03.834
Dying is easy, but I'd like to live.

01:29:06.126 --> 01:29:09.501
Did I tell you about the young man
who did my papers?

01:29:09.626 --> 01:29:11.334
It is like magic.

01:29:12.459 --> 01:29:14.459
He can make you a new life.

01:29:14.584 --> 01:29:16.417
No, Khaled. There's no need.

01:29:16.542 --> 01:29:19.167
I don't want to change my name.

01:29:19.292 --> 01:29:20.917
I want to keep my identity.

01:29:21.667 --> 01:29:23.792
I'll go and report myself tomorrow.

01:29:25.876 --> 01:29:27.667
As you wish.

01:29:28.292 --> 01:29:29.834
I'll take you to Mirja,

01:29:29.959 --> 01:29:31.667
and tomorrow
we'll escort you to the police.

01:29:34.459 --> 01:29:37.001
You're the best brother in the world.

01:29:40.167 --> 01:29:43.584
Remember how I teased you as a child?

01:29:43.709 --> 01:29:46.584
When you were really thin.

01:29:47.459 --> 01:29:50.126
No, I don't.

01:31:01.667 --> 01:31:04.959
I warned you, Jewboy.

01:31:49.334 --> 01:31:51.584
Is that you?

01:31:51.709 --> 01:31:53.917
What would you like?
I'm about to lock up.

01:31:55.459 --> 01:31:58.001
It's just me.

01:31:58.834 --> 01:32:02.001
I haven't drank a drop since you left.

01:32:02.126 --> 01:32:05.376
I set up this kiosk.

01:32:05.917 --> 01:32:07.459
Would you like something?

01:32:07.584 --> 01:32:11.292
I don't need anything, but...
I can drive you home.

01:32:29.417 --> 01:32:32.209
- How have you been?
- Fine.

01:32:33.334 --> 01:32:36.876
A bit lonely. You?

01:32:38.001 --> 01:32:42.001
I've founded a profitable restaurant.
I need a headwaiter.

01:32:47.751 --> 01:32:49.709
I've kept this.

01:32:50.751 --> 01:32:53.417
If you still want...

01:33:09.876 --> 01:33:12.251
Wait a sec.

01:33:17.417 --> 01:33:19.376
Khaled!

01:34:00.334 --> 01:34:02.501
Miriam.

01:34:04.126 --> 01:34:08.251
Go to the reception desk.
They will tell you what to do.

01:34:09.417 --> 01:34:13.334
Tell them you're directly
seeking asylum.

01:34:13.459 --> 01:34:14.709
Will you wait for me?

01:34:14.834 --> 01:34:16.209
I have to go now.

01:34:16.334 --> 01:34:19.209
We'll see in the evening.

01:34:23.376 --> 01:34:25.709
Go now.

01:35:52.126 --> 01:35:57.834
