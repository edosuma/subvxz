00:01.192 --> 00:03.204
Previously on NYPD Blue.

00:03.277 --> 00:05.004
- What happened, Doug?
- I shot him.

00:05.072 --> 00:07.663
Somebody killed your father.
You think a stranger did that?

00:07.734 --> 00:10.008
I want my brother to have a lawyer.

00:10.075 --> 00:13.727
He said... he was gonna
beat my half a brain...

00:13.796 --> 00:15.840
out of my head.

00:15.912 --> 00:18.853
We're talking about whether
this woman needs to be in the system...

00:18.926 --> 00:21.933
before the grand jury gets the case,
and both of us know that she can walk...

00:22.006 --> 00:24.378
unless you're lookin'
to kiss your boss's ass.

00:24.443 --> 00:27.232
Tell your girlfriend
she can take her mother home.

00:43.173 --> 00:46.114
Now, you think that's their
office's position or just this A.D. A?

00:48.528 --> 00:51.568
I gotta ask you, Miss Silver.
Please don't take this the wrong way.

00:51.638 --> 00:53.497
It isn't you, is it?

00:53.563 --> 00:56.471
It's not that you prefer
going to trial?

00:56.546 --> 00:59.586
Not- No. No, no, no, no.
Not building up fees.

00:59.656 --> 01:02.795
It's just you had said my mom's
case was really interesting...

01:02.864 --> 01:06.002
and you'd love
to defend her in court.

01:06.070 --> 01:08.410
Yeah, maybe we should.

01:08.476 --> 01:10.390
I'd appreciate it.

01:11.843 --> 01:14.019
Sure. That'd be fine.

01:14.088 --> 01:17.095
Now she's pissed off.

01:17.167 --> 01:19.146
Who? Your mom's lawyer?

01:19.220 --> 01:23.353
Mm. She doesn't want to approach the D.A.
About a plea until the grand jury votes...

01:23.421 --> 01:26.745
and it's a hundred percent
likelihood they're gonna indict.

01:26.821 --> 01:30.276
Meanwhile, my mom's sure
she's going on trial.

01:30.348 --> 01:33.104
She's afraid to go to sleep.
She's dreaming about it.

01:33.170 --> 01:35.509
Diane, your family lawyer says that this woman...

01:35.576 --> 01:37.817
is one of the best
with this type of case, right?

01:37.885 --> 01:40.224
I mean, Sylvia says she kicks ass.

01:40.290 --> 01:42.367
She's gonna stop by
on her way to court.

01:42.438 --> 01:44.713
She has a hearing
on some other case.

01:44.780 --> 01:47.853
Says we should talk
about what to do.

01:47.923 --> 01:51.860
Hey. Simone.
Your world, boss.

01:54.337 --> 01:56.228
Oh, yeah?
No, I know where it's at.

01:56.294 --> 01:58.086
Okay. Right.

01:59.949 --> 02:01.808
- Hmm.
- What?

02:01.873 --> 02:04.147
Homicide, Little Italy.

02:04.214 --> 02:07.035
Well, I'll see you at the house.

02:07.101 --> 02:10.818
- Yeah. Where are my keys?
- In the...

02:11.911 --> 02:14.087
No Court TV after I split.

02:14.157 --> 02:16.016
Busted.

02:18.037 --> 02:20.913
- See ya.
- Okay. Bye.

02:37.183 --> 02:40.507
- Hey, what do we got?
- D.O.A. Vincent Del Marco.

02:42.058 --> 02:44.781
- Related?
- Carmine's son, Carmine's house.

02:44.848 --> 02:47.987
One to the forehead.

02:48.055 --> 02:51.773
That's the mother. Says she was
at the market. Came home, found him.

02:51.840 --> 02:54.234
- Tell you anything else?
- Get lost.

02:57.740 --> 02:59.599
Thanks.

03:02.584 --> 03:06.269
Mrs. Del Marco, we're detectives.

03:06.335 --> 03:09.571
We're very sorry for your loss.
Can you answer some questions for us?

03:09.639 --> 03:12.514
No, I don't know what happened.

03:12.589 --> 03:15.979
- So Vincent had been shot when you came home?
- I was at the market.

03:16.053 --> 03:20.253
- When I got back, he was dead.
- Hey.

03:20.318 --> 03:22.559
- Any idea who might've done this?
- I don't know.

03:22.628 --> 03:25.252
I'd like to be left
alone, please.

03:25.322 --> 03:28.110
Hey, Bobby?

03:28.175 --> 03:31.478
- Let me in here.
- You gotta stay out of this room, sir.

03:31.543 --> 03:33.938
- This is my house.
- It's part of a crime scene.

03:34.013 --> 03:37.763
Mr. Del Marco, I'm Detective Simone.
This is Detectives Sipowicz and Martinez.

03:37.829 --> 03:39.973
This is my house here.
I need to see my son.

03:40.042 --> 03:42.731
- He's dead. Vincent is dead.
- Go upstairs.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.456
I don't know what to do.
Father Avacone is at his sister's in Saratoga.

03:45.526 --> 03:48.763
- I don't know what to do.
- Go upstairs. Go ahead.

03:50.176 --> 03:52.768
Go on.

03:54.378 --> 03:56.236
I've seen bodies before.

03:56.302 --> 04:00.468
Well, if we let you see Vincent, you gotta
promise not to disturb the crime scene.

04:00.535 --> 04:05.018
- I won't.
- You might wanna hold him and so forth. You can't do that.

04:25.293 --> 04:27.950
How did this happen,
Mr. Del Marco?

04:28.019 --> 04:30.293
He do something,
or is somebody after you?

04:30.360 --> 04:33.783
- He was killed close up, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

04:33.856 --> 04:37.541
- Nobody broke in?
- Nope.

04:37.609 --> 04:41.961
All right. All right.
I know what happened here.

04:42.035 --> 04:44.112
Do you wanna let us in on it?

04:44.183 --> 04:47.966
Do what you gotta do and get out.
Nobody here's got anything to say to you guys.

06:01.835 --> 06:03.431
I got it.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.629
What's the story on your D.O. A?

06:08.699 --> 06:11.574
Carmine Del Marco's kid shot
at his parents' breakfast table.

06:11.648 --> 06:14.557
Family gave tremendous
cooperation. Nobody saw dick.

06:14.631 --> 06:17.484
- Anything on canvass?
- James is still out.

06:17.550 --> 06:20.721
We got a next-door neighbor who's got something.
She didn't want to talk at the crime scene.

06:20.789 --> 06:25.403
- You want to contact O.C.C. B?
- Get their ideas, any possible links with Lucky Luciano?

06:25.471 --> 06:27.548
Let's see what the neighbor gives us.

06:27.620 --> 06:31.589
Yeah, we just got a homicide
in Chelsea. Russell's up.

06:31.661 --> 06:34.055
She's ready to catch.

06:39.839 --> 06:41.249
- Hey, Diane?
- Yeah.

06:41.314 --> 06:43.654
- A homicide on 17 th Street.
- All right.

06:43.719 --> 06:46.857
Might go into a lot of overtime.
You up to that?

06:46.927 --> 06:49.583
Geez, I'd hate to make
some extra money on this job.

06:49.652 --> 06:52.594
- Yeah, okay. Work it with Greg.
- May I help you?

06:52.667 --> 06:54.843
- I'm here to see Detective Simone.
- Greg.

06:54.912 --> 06:57.668
Detective Simone?

06:58.888 --> 07:00.747
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:00.812 --> 07:04.432
I'm Marian Kadell.
I live next to the Del Marcos.

07:04.501 --> 07:06.743
Detective Martinez
told me to ask for you.

07:06.810 --> 07:08.669
Well, we appreciate
your coming in, Mrs. Kadell.

07:08.734 --> 07:10.626
- This is my partner, Detective Sipowicz.
- How do you do?

07:10.690 --> 07:13.631
How do you do? Could we
talk somewhere in private?

07:13.705 --> 07:16.100
I'm very nervous just being here.

07:16.175 --> 07:18.766
- We'll go in this next room here, have some coffee.
- Come here.

07:18.837 --> 07:20.696
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

07:26.180 --> 07:29.701
I just want to tell you up front
I'm not testifying at any trial.

07:29.773 --> 07:31.719
All right. Let's just
take it slow, Mrs. Kadell.

07:31.794 --> 07:34.669
A trial is not even in the picture
right now. You want some coffee?

07:34.743 --> 07:38.647
No, I just want to make it clear
becauseJimmy's father being who he is.

07:38.721 --> 07:41.214
Vincent was the son who was shot.

07:41.286 --> 07:43.495
Jimmy is the youngest Del Marco boy.

07:43.563 --> 07:46.220
He killed Vincent.

07:46.289 --> 07:48.432
- You saw that happen?
- No.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.361
Barbara Del Marco told me.

07:50.427 --> 07:52.881
She came running over,
crying for me to call an ambulance.

07:53.009 --> 07:56.312
- She tell you she seen the shooting?
- No, she was at the market.

07:56.377 --> 07:58.838
But she says, 'I know it's Jimmy."

07:58.911 --> 08:01.404
She say ifher sons had argued?

08:01.476 --> 08:03.652
Argued? No, listen.

08:03.721 --> 08:06.728
I've lived next to
the Del Marcos for 24 years.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.293
I've seen both those boys grow up.

08:09.365 --> 08:11.924
Jimmy was always bad.

08:11.995 --> 08:14.039
He was so handsome.

08:14.112 --> 08:17.535
But he had the coldest eyes
I've ever seen.

08:17.608 --> 08:21.960
Like an animal.
Only Vincent was so sweet.

08:22.033 --> 08:24.657
I'm telling you, the wrong
boy died this morning.

08:24.727 --> 08:27.581
Were the boys involved
in their father's business?

08:27.645 --> 08:30.171
Mobsters? Vincent?

08:30.243 --> 08:33.961
No, he owned his own plumbing
supply company on Long Island.

08:34.028 --> 08:36.750
- What aboutJimmy?
- Jimmy? Well, Jimmy...

08:36.818 --> 08:40.601
Jimmy was always dressed
very nice, but he was a bum.

08:40.666 --> 08:43.575
I know he was arrested before.

08:43.649 --> 08:46.502
All right. Well, thanks
very much for your help, Mrs. Kadell.

08:46.568 --> 08:49.257
Listen, I...

08:49.325 --> 08:53.108
I don't like being the one
to send Barbara's last boy tojail.

08:53.174 --> 08:57.241
She's a good friend of mine.
But he's caused so much grief.

08:57.312 --> 09:01.095
Can you imagine?
To kill his own brother?

09:01.160 --> 09:03.019
- All right. Thank you.
- Oh!

09:03.084 --> 09:05.960
Listen, you're not gonna
tell anybody that I was here?

09:06.034 --> 09:08.406
- No, we won't.
- Okay, thank you.

09:10.172 --> 09:12.730
Another close-knit O.C. Family.

09:37.014 --> 09:40.250
- What do we got?
- D.O.A.'s a white female, 48, Georgia Tierney.

09:40.318 --> 09:43.674
Shot in the head. Husband, Theodore.
He's inside. Already lawyered up.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.755
- Who's that?
- That's another one.

09:46.829 --> 09:49.037
- Works for the one inside.
- What's the one named inside?

09:49.106 --> 09:52.692
- Barry Ulin.
- Oh. Barry Ulin, huh?

09:52.762 --> 09:54.621
Should I know who that is?

09:54.686 --> 09:57.857
Nah. Ignorance on lawyers
reflects a good upbringing.

10:03.665 --> 10:06.126
The body's down here.

10:07.449 --> 10:09.723
- Did you find a weapon?
- Not in the bedroom.

10:09.791 --> 10:13.924
That one wanted a warrant
to let us look anywhere else.

10:20.952 --> 10:23.412
Contact wound.

10:23.485 --> 10:26.492
Got a broken window here, Greg.

10:30.637 --> 10:33.546
If it was a forced entry,
somebody cleaned up after.

10:33.620 --> 10:36.375
Yeah. Window could've
been broke another time.

10:36.442 --> 10:39.350
Then it could be a suicide.
Or he shoots her while she's sleeping.

10:39.424 --> 10:41.917
Think he wants a lawyer
'cause she killed herself?

10:49.655 --> 10:51.929
Mr. Tierney, I'm Detective Russell.

10:51.996 --> 10:55.451
I'm Barry Ulin, counsel to Mr. Tierney.
He's not answering any questions.

10:55.523 --> 10:57.700
Your wife's dead in there, Mr. Tierney.

10:57.769 --> 11:00.425
- I'm following my counsel's advice.
- If you don't cooperate...

11:00.495 --> 11:02.287
that makes us think of you
as a suspect.

11:02.354 --> 11:05.558
You've got a right to think.
He has a right not to say anything.

11:05.626 --> 11:08.250
I would also appreciate it
that you restrict your activities...

11:08.319 --> 11:11.293
to the area of the body
until you get your warrant.

11:11.366 --> 11:13.738
- Did you kill her, Mr. Tierney?
- Hey, that's enough.

11:13.804 --> 11:16.012
I'll be back
with a search warrant.

11:16.081 --> 11:18.541
In the meantime, this house
and the crime scene are secured.

11:18.614 --> 11:20.856
Don't let them in the bedroom
till we come back.

11:20.923 --> 11:22.782
Got it.

11:22.847 --> 11:26.500
- What's it look like?
- Looks like that guy shot his wife.

11:33.399 --> 11:35.509
Hang out a while.
We're getting a warrant.

11:35.580 --> 11:37.372
Okay.

11:37.440 --> 11:40.261
I'm George Weiss, David. I work for Mr. Ulin.
I'm sorry about your mother.

11:40.326 --> 11:42.535
What's the current version? Has he changed
his story the last few minutes?

11:42.603 --> 11:45.227
Your stepfather's upstairs.
He and Mr. Ulin would like to talk with you.

11:45.297 --> 11:47.309
- I'm Detective Russell. Do you know this man?
- No.

11:47.382 --> 11:49.721
- David, I know your stepdad wants to see you.
- My good buddy.

11:49.787 --> 11:52.640
Hey, Counselor, you don't represent
this gentleman, so get away from him.

11:52.706 --> 11:55.012
Then I'd like to go inside.
I need to speak with Mr. Ulin.

11:55.079 --> 11:57.735
- We'll let your boss know you want to see him.
- Go stand over here.

11:57.805 --> 12:00.626
Go get the lawyer. Do you have any idea
what happened to your mother?

12:00.691 --> 12:03.894
She got murdered. Came home this morning.
There's three messages on my answering machine.

12:03.963 --> 12:06.489
- Each one he's more wasted.
- This is your stepfather?

12:06.560 --> 12:10.081
First message he says that there was a fight,
the gun went off, and he killed her.

12:10.152 --> 12:14.504
Next one she's trying to kill herself, and
he was trying to take the gun, and it went off.

12:14.578 --> 12:17.552
Last one's a burglar. He says
she was going after a burglar, and she fell.

12:17.625 --> 12:21.463
- These were on your machine?
- Then Mr. Ulin wants me to contact him as soon as possible.

12:21.537 --> 12:23.395
David, come here.

12:23.461 --> 12:25.855
You got that out good, Ted.

12:25.931 --> 12:28.752
You must've been shoveling coffee
down your throat the last six hours, huh?

12:28.817 --> 12:30.676
- We need to talk to you.
- What's the point?

12:30.742 --> 12:33.016
David, can I please talk to you?

12:36.963 --> 12:39.652
You can't talk to your father right now.

12:39.721 --> 12:42.060
- Mr. Tierney, you're under arrest.
- What is this?

12:42.126 --> 12:43.985
- You're under arrest. Let's go.
- Barry.

12:44.051 --> 12:46.577
It'll be all right. On what basis
is he being arrested?

12:46.649 --> 12:49.043
You can talk to your client
after he's been booked.

12:49.118 --> 12:51.032
- Take him in a separate car.
- It'll be all right.

12:51.107 --> 12:53.315
Sure.

12:53.384 --> 12:55.527
David, why don't you ride
to the station house with me.

12:55.596 --> 12:57.455
Ride with me. Please.

12:57.520 --> 12:59.379
This oughta be interesting.

13:15.480 --> 13:17.371
In here, sir.

13:17.437 --> 13:18.967
- Hey, James?
- Yeah.

13:19.040 --> 13:21.500
A shooting at 14th and Third.
Work it with Adrianne.

13:21.573 --> 13:23.005
Okay, Lieu.

13:23.080 --> 13:25.639
That's the D.O.A.'s husband
on my homicide, Lieu. He's a collar.

13:25.710 --> 13:28.137
- Barry Ulin's his lawyer.
- Barry's been busy on the cell phone?

13:28.212 --> 13:30.191
Mm-hmm. What do we got?

13:30.264 --> 13:33.500
D.O.A. Shot at close range,
Iying face up on the bed.

13:33.568 --> 13:36.608
Apane in the bedroom window's broken,
but the window's not unlocked or raised.

13:36.679 --> 13:40.331
And there's no sign of a struggle
or ransacking. What do you want?

13:40.399 --> 13:43.122
I'm the riding D.A. I assume
this involves the Tierney case?

13:45.530 --> 13:47.870
Ulin's wrapped around the husband
and won't let him talk.

13:47.935 --> 13:50.428
He wants a warrant to let us look around.
We're leaving to get one.

13:50.501 --> 13:53.125
The D.O.A.'s son shows up.
Husband's stepson.

13:53.195 --> 13:55.053
He tells us the husband's a big oiler.

13:55.119 --> 13:58.355
Left a bunch of drunken messages on the kid's
answering machine about shooting the wife.

13:58.422 --> 14:00.631
I collar the husband
to keep him away from the kid...

14:00.699 --> 14:02.711
but the kid
gets in the car with Ulin.

14:02.784 --> 14:04.763
- Who now arrives to get his client kicked.
- Detective?

14:04.837 --> 14:07.910
- One minute.
- Have we got enough to hold him?

14:07.979 --> 14:10.056
Ulin's already been
on the phone with my boss.

14:10.128 --> 14:12.500
- I gather you didn't find a weapon?
- No.

14:12.566 --> 14:16.469
I'll get a search warrant, but there's no way
the gun's gonna still be in the house.

14:16.542 --> 14:18.816
So your shot's the message tape
from the son's apartment.

14:18.883 --> 14:22.306
Without supporting evidence, this tape will
have to directly incriminate for us to go to bat.

14:22.379 --> 14:25.999
Excuse me! I would like Theodore Tierney
charged or released.

14:26.067 --> 14:29.490
Counselor, allegations have
been made against Mr. Tierney.

14:29.563 --> 14:32.023
- We're gonna look-
- Those allegations come from David Tierney.

14:32.096 --> 14:34.272
David spoke to me and told me
he was angry and upset...

14:34.342 --> 14:37.031
when he talked to your detectives
and said things he didn't mean.

14:37.099 --> 14:39.471
You'd understand us wanting
to hear that from him.

14:39.537 --> 14:42.226
Here's his phone number.
He'll also tell you I'm now his attorney.

14:42.295 --> 14:44.154
That's your beeper?

14:44.220 --> 14:46.526
- Are you gonna call David Tierney?
- I'll call him when I'm ready.

14:46.593 --> 14:49.501
LfTheodore Tierney is not
released in timely fashion...

14:49.575 --> 14:52.298
I'm gonna run up some hours
on a civil lawsuit.

14:52.365 --> 14:54.705
Nobody talks to him.

14:54.770 --> 14:58.521
If you're gonna make a try for the stepson,
you probably oughta get on that.

15:00.832 --> 15:03.938
- How's your mother?
- What's that supposed to mean?

15:04.007 --> 15:08.107
Well, I think that would fall under the
category of a polite inquiry, Detective.

15:08.176 --> 15:10.035
She's all right.

15:10.101 --> 15:12.528
Gentlemen.

15:12.602 --> 15:16.385
- Is that the asshole prosecuting Diane's mother?
- What's he doing here?

15:16.450 --> 15:18.789
He's riding today.
Caught Russell's homicide.

15:18.856 --> 15:20.900
- Small world.
- But ugly.

15:20.972 --> 15:22.831
So, what do you got?

15:22.897 --> 15:26.450
Ah, there's nobody at this
Jimmy Del Marco's last address.

15:26.520 --> 15:30.238
Jimmy's got two rob-assault collars down
in Midtown South, and the guys over there say...

15:30.305 --> 15:33.629
that his act is taking off gays in the
West Village, plus shaking down bar owners.

15:33.705 --> 15:37.291
- You gonna check that out?
- Yeah. B.C.I., they're sending Del Marco's picture and a car.

15:37.360 --> 15:40.400
- We're gonna show it around Christopher Street.
- Just let me spruce up.

15:42.043 --> 15:44.022
David, I would be really grateful...

15:44.095 --> 15:46.784
if you could come in
and talk to me in person.

15:46.853 --> 15:49.062
Yeah. Great.
Thank you very much.

15:51.182 --> 15:53.041
Hi.

15:53.107 --> 15:54.966
How are you, Diane?

15:55.031 --> 15:57.590
Worried that I offended you,
for one thing.

15:57.661 --> 16:01.214
Oh, I don't know. I don't think
it's so irrational to consider a lawyer...

16:01.285 --> 16:04.325
possibly having interests
contrary to her client's.

16:06.417 --> 16:09.555
- Do you want to get some coffee or something?
- Sure.

16:09.623 --> 16:11.700
The reason I've held off, Diane...

16:11.772 --> 16:14.199
with the D.A.'s reluctant
to discuss a plea for your mom...

16:14.273 --> 16:17.280
it mildly weakens our position
to push the conversation.

16:17.353 --> 16:20.009
I think why they're reluctant
is with you being a cop...

16:20.079 --> 16:21.871
they have public relations problems...

16:21.939 --> 16:24.464
if they accept a plea from your
mom too early in the process.

16:24.537 --> 16:26.428
I know that makes sense.
Coffee?

16:26.493 --> 16:28.351
No, thanks.

16:28.417 --> 16:33.031
On the other hand, just the prospect of a trial
is an emotional strain on your mother.

16:33.100 --> 16:36.140
And on you because
you're worried about her.

16:36.210 --> 16:40.245
So to hell with Maury Abrams
and his public relations problems.

16:40.315 --> 16:43.420
Let me get together with him
and young Mr. Cohen...

16:43.490 --> 16:47.907
and brief them on the case law
we'll use to kick their asses if they go to trial.

16:47.980 --> 16:50.801
Several of which cases yours truly argued.

16:51.925 --> 16:54.297
Then suggest
we're willing to talk deal.

16:54.362 --> 16:58.495
If you think it's bad strategy, it might hurt
what kind of arrangement you can make.

16:58.563 --> 17:01.636
I won't let that happen.

17:03.470 --> 17:05.067
Okay.

17:07.736 --> 17:10.425
I apologize if you took offense.

17:10.492 --> 17:13.817
Impervious to insult.
Occupational requirement.

17:35.285 --> 17:38.521
I'm Detective Sipowicz.
This is Detective Simone.

17:38.587 --> 17:41.408
We need to ask you a few
questions aboutJimmy Del Marco.

17:41.473 --> 17:44.382
I don't need to see a picture ofJimmy Del Marco.
I've seen enough of that guy.

17:44.456 --> 17:47.430
- Jimmy shakes you down?
- I don't think he's gonna come around this week.

17:47.503 --> 17:49.197
Oh, really?

17:49.266 --> 17:51.246
What did Jimmy D. Do this time?

17:51.320 --> 17:54.141
- How do you know him?
- The G. Q Manson?

17:54.206 --> 17:57.279
I'm half blind in my right eye...

17:57.349 --> 18:00.225
'cause he pistol-whipped me
up and down the back alley one night.

18:00.300 --> 18:05.199
That's after he stole $ 150
I was gonna send to my niece.

18:05.270 --> 18:07.926
Well, now there's a good chance
thatJimmy blew his brother's head off.

18:07.997 --> 18:11.233
Well, I hope you find him
and kill him in custody.

18:11.299 --> 18:14.273
- Tom.
- I'll say what I want, Paul.

18:14.346 --> 18:16.325
I don't have a bar to get torched.

18:16.399 --> 18:19.985
Hey, why don't we go back to figurin' that
Jimmy's not gonna be making his rounds anymore?

18:20.054 --> 18:22.548
- Just an impression I get.
- Mm-hmm.

18:22.621 --> 18:27.453
A rather elegant Italian man
was in aboutJimmy an hour ago.

18:27.527 --> 18:29.899
He left here
and went to Harvey's Bar...

18:29.965 --> 18:34.000
and then a few minutes later I noticed him
walking toward the Palazzo Tavern.

18:34.070 --> 18:38.335
I think his visit's the basis
for Paul's impression.

18:38.399 --> 18:41.537
- So, Paul, the old man did come in?
- What did Carmine tell you?

18:41.606 --> 18:44.001
You don't give the kid up,
he'll make him leave town?

18:44.076 --> 18:45.934
Nobody home, Detective.

18:46.000 --> 18:51.413
Hey, we are looking to take this Jimmy
out of circulation for good.

18:51.484 --> 18:54.240
Really.
Where can we find him?

18:55.460 --> 18:58.369
Well, I can't give you an address...

18:58.443 --> 19:01.417
butJimmy did used to ride around
with another psychopath...

19:01.490 --> 19:04.464
in a tricked-out black Cadillac.

19:04.537 --> 19:07.992
What was that stupid license plate?
Mr. Groovy"?

19:09.668 --> 19:11.910
Dr. Funky."

19:13.196 --> 19:15.273
Does that qualify as a lead?

19:16.595 --> 19:18.739
Absolutely.

19:26.986 --> 19:28.845
- What's up?
- Carmine reached out.

19:28.911 --> 19:32.062
Promised all these gay bar owners if they
monk up, he'd getJimmy out of town.

19:32.190 --> 19:36.323
A fruit in one of the bars gave us a license plate
we could try. Some jerk drives Jimmy around.

19:36.391 --> 19:38.764
Your guy did the double
James and Adrianne are working.

19:38.829 --> 19:40.688
This guy lookin' to set a record?

19:40.753 --> 19:43.574
Husband and wife are in a bridal shop
getting fitted for their daughter's wedding.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.979
A guy in a silk suit
walks in to stick 'em up.

19:46.045 --> 19:47.992
They're giving up their money,
but the guy murders both them.

19:48.066 --> 19:51.389
Then he's trying to whack the owner.
The gun jams, so he splits.

19:51.465 --> 19:53.192
- And it's Jimmy Del Marco.
- It's Jimmy Del Marco.

19:53.261 --> 19:56.082
The owner recognizes the kid.
He's been in there like three or four times.

19:56.147 --> 19:59.088
- You showed him Del Marco's picture?
- Yeah, he picked him right out.

19:59.162 --> 20:01.721
You wanna talk to him?
I'll run Dr. Funky's license plate.

20:01.792 --> 20:03.651
Yeah.

20:05.993 --> 20:09.131
I don't understand.
What could've been in his mind?

20:09.201 --> 20:11.092
Take it easy, Mr. Hannon.

20:11.156 --> 20:14.874
This is Detective Sipowicz. He'd like
to talk to you a bit about what happened.

20:14.941 --> 20:17.215
I don't understand it.

20:17.282 --> 20:21.569
I just said he murdered them for no reason,
and he tried to murder me for no reason.

20:21.644 --> 20:23.885
- This is Jimmy Del Marco?
- I know him.

20:23.952 --> 20:26.609
Mrs. Leon was trying
to get her ring off.

20:26.678 --> 20:28.625
She had just given him her purse.

20:28.699 --> 20:32.482
- And Mr. Leon, he had just given his wallet over.
- And he just opened fire?

20:32.547 --> 20:34.591
She was struggling to get the ring off...

20:34.665 --> 20:38.535
and he yelled some obscenity at her,
called her something and started shooting.

20:38.609 --> 20:43.442
And also... he tried to shoot me too.

20:43.516 --> 20:47.616
His gun jammed.
They were just Iying in blood.

20:47.685 --> 20:50.659
- All right.
- I know the family.

20:50.731 --> 20:53.421
He came in to look at a tuxedo
several years ago...

20:53.490 --> 20:55.731
and said my stock was a joke.

20:55.798 --> 20:58.740
Did he expect I wouldn't
remember he insulted me?

20:58.814 --> 21:01.984
- Any chance you noticed the car he was in?
- Yes!

21:02.053 --> 21:05.508
Like the cars pimps drive.

21:05.580 --> 21:08.849
- Gold hubcaps. Gold all over.
- Thanks a lot.

21:13.245 --> 21:16.187
You got an apartment number?
Thanks.

21:18.761 --> 21:22.118
- How'd you do with Dr. Funky?
- I got it.

21:22.193 --> 21:25.199
Plate's registered to a Joe Carlin.
This guy lives out in Brooklyn.

21:25.271 --> 21:28.956
Yeah? Well, it sounds like he did
a bridal shop in Manhattan this afternoon.

21:29.024 --> 21:32.347
- This guy lives like five blocks from me.
- Good. You can check your birds.

21:32.423 --> 21:35.977
Hey, I do have a new pair of Satinettes.
I'll show 'em to you.

21:36.047 --> 21:38.803
What?

21:43.488 --> 21:46.812
David, thanks for coming in.

21:46.887 --> 21:48.899
I'm sorry I put you in this position.

21:48.972 --> 21:51.049
I know you arrested him
because of me, and...

21:51.121 --> 21:54.674
I arrested your stepfather because
you said he admitted killing your mother.

21:54.744 --> 21:56.603
Have a seat.

21:56.669 --> 21:59.162
He said a lot of different things.

21:59.235 --> 22:01.793
First thing was that he killed her.

22:01.865 --> 22:04.423
Look, I was upset.
I'm not sure what he said.

22:04.494 --> 22:07.184
David, I'd like to hear those messages
on your answering machine.

22:07.252 --> 22:10.740
- They're erased.
- When did that happen?

22:10.812 --> 22:13.786
This morning, before I went
over to their apartment.

22:13.859 --> 22:16.253
I erased them after I played them.

22:16.328 --> 22:18.472
Look, what's the point?
If they hadn't been erased...

22:18.541 --> 22:21.001
if I'd given them to you,
he's still never going to jail.

22:21.074 --> 22:25.941
The point is telling the truth. Speaking for
your mother when she can't speak for herself.

22:26.014 --> 22:29.951
That's pretty, but my mother never spoke
for herself when she had the chance.

22:30.023 --> 22:32.231
She was as much of a drunk as Big Ted.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.606
She left a good man.

22:34.673 --> 22:37.996
So she deserved to be killed?

22:38.072 --> 22:43.299
David, however your stepfather's lawyer
got you to change your story...

22:43.364 --> 22:46.687
I don't think he changed
your real feelings.

22:46.763 --> 22:49.901
Now, is it possible
you didn't erase those messages?

22:49.971 --> 22:53.174
They're still around somewhere, and you're
deciding what you should do with them?

22:56.545 --> 22:58.884
- No.
- No?

23:02.798 --> 23:05.904
I wish you and I had met
under different circumstances.

23:07.545 --> 23:09.404
Excuse me.

23:09.470 --> 23:12.193
Think about what
you're doing, David.

23:12.259 --> 23:15.462
- Yeah, okay.
- You promise?

23:15.531 --> 23:18.122
Yeah, I'll think about it.

23:18.192 --> 23:20.051
I'll be here.

23:33.554 --> 23:35.894
Down here, Joe.

23:42.437 --> 23:44.296
Give me a second.

23:44.362 --> 23:47.565
Is that the guy you figure
for Del Marco's wheel man?

23:47.633 --> 23:50.005
- Yeah, it's Joe Carlin.
- Okay, Midtown South called.

23:50.071 --> 23:53.340
They got a 21- year-old
male hustler D.O.A. In a garbage can.

23:53.406 --> 23:55.746
Guy's been dead about 18 hours.
Shot with a nine-millimeter.

23:55.811 --> 23:57.670
So in going through the guy's apartment...

23:57.735 --> 24:00.162
they find six negatives of him
going down on Jimmy Del Marco.

24:01.744 --> 24:04.368
Plus a bunch of balled-up versions
of a blackmail note in the trash.

24:04.438 --> 24:06.614
Kid's asking 1,200 bucks
for the pictures.

24:06.683 --> 24:09.559
So you figure that's what moved Jimmy
from shakedowns to homicides?

24:09.633 --> 24:13.504
M.E. Autopsies him. Finds 12
one-dollar bills stuffed up his ass.

24:13.579 --> 24:16.433
Yeah, Jimmy wants to make his point...

24:16.497 --> 24:18.869
but he don't wanna spend
a lot of money.

24:21.083 --> 24:25.183
I've got an idea, Joe. Why don't you
tell us where we can find Jimmy Del Marco.

24:25.252 --> 24:28.456
- Who's that?
- The guy you were driving all afternoon.

24:28.523 --> 24:31.847
- I was in bed all afternoon. I got a cold.
- Well, I don't hear it in ya.

24:31.923 --> 24:35.225
Of course, you being a physician and all,
you probably prescribed yourself something.

24:35.290 --> 24:37.532
What's that supposed to mean?

24:37.599 --> 24:39.644
On you license plate,
it says you're an M.D.

24:39.716 --> 24:42.209
That's a joke. Dr. Funky."

24:42.282 --> 24:45.288
Oh, so you're not really a doctor.

24:45.360 --> 24:49.231
So, Joe, when you were outside that bridal shop
in that quiet little Caddy that you drive...

24:49.305 --> 24:51.164
you got I.D.'d, man.

24:51.229 --> 24:53.755
Three different people
picked you out of the mug books.

24:53.827 --> 24:57.993
In your line of work, it's probably
a mistake driving flashy wheels, Joe.

24:58.060 --> 25:00.783
Especially when you got
a face like a dog's ass...

25:00.851 --> 25:03.672
that probably draws
people's attention right there.

25:03.737 --> 25:06.295
You'll get nothing from me, all right?

25:06.367 --> 25:08.608
Jimmy Del Marco's going down, Joe.

25:08.675 --> 25:10.785
The bridal shop guy
I.D.'d him for those murders.

25:10.856 --> 25:13.579
We got him whacking some gay hustler
over some party pictures...

25:13.646 --> 25:15.593
not to mention
he shoots his own brother.

25:15.667 --> 25:17.744
Yeah, well, I ain't
gettin' my head blown off.

25:17.816 --> 25:21.468
Give up an address, Joe. You were drivin' a car.
You didn't know what was gonna happen.

25:24.551 --> 25:27.656
Let me tell you somethin'-
how people get screwed.

25:27.725 --> 25:31.181
I'm drivin' a person out of harm's way...

25:31.254 --> 25:33.266
as a favor for somebody else.

25:33.338 --> 25:35.197
The person's relative.

25:35.262 --> 25:38.083
Asshole jumps outta the car
for something he has no reason to do!

25:38.148 --> 25:40.969
- Like pulling a stickup.
- But for money he don't need!

25:41.035 --> 25:45.934
He's got all the travelin' money
he needs... from his relative.

25:46.006 --> 25:48.345
From Carmine?

25:48.412 --> 25:51.582
That's how you wind up screwed.
And I do have a cold.

25:51.651 --> 25:53.827
And I did get out of bed
to do a favor.

25:53.895 --> 25:56.388
And I wind up in a disaster,
so screw the both of you!

25:56.461 --> 25:58.855
- Just tell us where you can find him.
- No way, man. No way!

25:58.930 --> 26:01.205
Yeah, you don't want to
compromise your big future, Joe.

26:01.272 --> 26:03.961
I see you operating
a huge fleet of limos.

26:04.029 --> 26:07.583
I bought that car for 208 bucks
off a crackhead Arab kid...

26:07.654 --> 26:10.114
whose life was ruined.

26:10.188 --> 26:14.124
Mm. Must be an unlucky vehicle.

26:15.704 --> 26:19.027
Crime Scene found a.25-caliber
shell casing in Tierney's bedroom.

26:19.103 --> 26:22.372
Pistol License Bureau shows Tierney
with a target permit for a.25.

26:22.438 --> 26:25.828
- So how are we doin' with the search warrant?
- It's supposed to be on the way.

26:25.901 --> 26:28.558
David Tierney wants to meet us
when we go back to the apartment.

26:28.628 --> 26:30.487
Well, that can't be bad, huh?

26:30.553 --> 26:33.209
It's not gonna make him love his stepfather
seeing how the mother was executed.

26:33.278 --> 26:35.137
Yeah. Maybe you can flip him back.

26:35.203 --> 26:37.630
Fifteenth. Yeah.

26:37.704 --> 26:39.715
Hold on one second. Hold on.

26:39.788 --> 26:43.374
Detectives, someone
has information regarding your case.

26:44.856 --> 26:46.714
Line three.

26:49.891 --> 26:51.783
Yeah? Can I help you?

26:51.847 --> 26:55.597
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

26:55.664 --> 26:58.572
He's gonna be there?

26:58.646 --> 27:03.676
Well, how many tanks is it gonna take
for us to get inside there?

27:03.745 --> 27:06.566
No, huh?
You can guarantee that?

27:06.632 --> 27:10.469
What? Who might you be? Oh.

27:14.393 --> 27:17.783
Jimmy Del Marco's playing gin
at Salvatore's Chess and Social Club.

27:17.856 --> 27:20.382
He doesn't know anybody
dropped the dime.

27:20.454 --> 27:23.330
- And nobody'll give us trouble going in.
- Who says all this?

27:23.405 --> 27:26.411
It was like this handkerchief on
the mouthpiece. My money's on Carmine.

27:26.483 --> 27:29.272
The son's still a psychopath.
Get E.S.U. To back you.

27:29.338 --> 27:31.197
All right.

27:34.982 --> 27:39.246
- Your warrant for that Tierney apartment.
- Thank you.

27:39.312 --> 27:41.739
Yeah. Excuse me if I don't
go over particulars with you.

27:41.813 --> 27:45.399
I gotta hurry back to get fitted
for my patsy outfit in your mother's case.

27:48.452 --> 27:50.758
- You follow that?
- Not exactly.

27:50.825 --> 27:53.001
But I hope he's getting screwed.

27:53.070 --> 27:54.862
Let's go.

28:17.540 --> 28:19.552
- Hi.
- How's it going?

28:19.625 --> 28:21.801
David Tierney,
this is Detective Medavoy.

28:21.869 --> 28:23.881
I don't know if you two
met this morning.

28:23.954 --> 28:25.813
Yeah. Sorry for your loss.

28:25.878 --> 28:28.535
I wanted to see my mother.

28:31.523 --> 28:34.694
- We got our warrant, Donny.
- Okay.

28:39.316 --> 28:44.061
You're not aware of any places in the house
where a weapon might've been kept?

28:44.127 --> 28:46.401
No. I didn't come here very much.

28:46.467 --> 28:49.375
All right. I'm gonna
look for the gun in here.

28:49.450 --> 28:52.009
I'll go over the bedroom again.

28:52.080 --> 28:54.836
You can come with me.
We can't disturb anything.

28:57.307 --> 28:59.450
- Hi.
- Hey.

28:59.521 --> 29:01.915
Get one from the other side.

29:11.323 --> 29:13.181
I got it.

29:17.031 --> 29:19.524
- Give us a second, huh?
- Sure.

29:27.838 --> 29:30.299
This was cold-blooded murder, David.

29:30.372 --> 29:32.766
No gun went off accidentally.

29:32.842 --> 29:36.713
There was no struggle.
Your mother was asleep.

29:36.787 --> 29:41.915
Your stepfather put a gun
to her temple and pulled the trigger.

29:41.982 --> 29:45.022
- You think he should get away with that?
- No.

29:45.093 --> 29:47.236
But there's nothing I can do about it.

29:47.305 --> 29:49.284
That's not true.

29:49.358 --> 29:52.464
I think you've still got those messages.

29:52.533 --> 29:55.857
You were too angry to have erased them.

29:55.933 --> 29:58.557
And they give you too much leverage.

30:01.032 --> 30:03.590
- What do you mean, leverage?
- Leverage, David.

30:03.661 --> 30:06.603
- Over your stepfather who has a lot of money.
- I'm a graduate student!

30:06.677 --> 30:10.132
If I was so interested in money, do you
think I'd still be studying for my Ph. D?

30:10.204 --> 30:14.622
Maybe you're interested in money,
but you don't want to hold down a job.

30:17.099 --> 30:19.822
What did you think
you were gonna see here?

30:19.890 --> 30:22.284
What could you have seen
that would've changed your mind?

30:23.513 --> 30:26.454
Nothing.
You'll never understand.

30:26.527 --> 30:30.245
I understand. Go home
and have a good cry, David.

30:30.312 --> 30:32.226
How the world
doesn't understand you.

31:02.928 --> 31:05.684
- Get lost.
- Yes, sir.

31:05.750 --> 31:08.856
All right, let's be heads-up. This guy
spent his whole day shooting people.

31:08.925 --> 31:11.352
- Come on, Jimmy.
- You don't need fours.

31:11.427 --> 31:13.504
You're running clubs.

31:13.575 --> 31:15.434
I'm running clubs.

31:15.499 --> 31:17.806
- The scumbag in the corner.
- All right. We got him.

31:17.873 --> 31:20.148
It's in your face,
you dumb son of a bitch.

31:20.214 --> 31:23.767
One of these days you're gonna learn how
to play, calling me to steal all your money.

31:23.838 --> 31:26.233
Maybe one day your luck'll run out.

31:26.308 --> 31:29.544
- All right. You're under arrest.
- I'm in the middle of a game.

31:29.611 --> 31:31.721
Yeah? What was your brother
in the middle of, Jimmy?

31:31.792 --> 31:34.131
And how about those people
in that bridal shop?

31:34.197 --> 31:37.073
- Hey, Carl, call my pop.
- Joey, how about a game of gin?

31:37.148 --> 31:39.520
- Hey, Carl, call my pop!
- Yeah, I'll get right on the phone, Jimmy.

31:39.585 --> 31:41.597
- Don't worry.
- Let's go.

31:41.670 --> 31:44.425
Thanks for all your help,
you lazy sons of bitches!

31:44.492 --> 31:46.799
- There's the old man. Waitin' till the game's over.
- Come on.

31:46.865 --> 31:49.292
- Joe, are you comin' over or not?
- Yeah.

32:02.323 --> 32:05.199
- How's it going, Jimmy?
- Where's my old man?

32:06.524 --> 32:08.951
I wouldn't be waiting
for the cavalry, Jimmy.

32:09.025 --> 32:11.234
You oughta think
about a statement of remorse.

32:11.302 --> 32:14.156
We got eyewitnesses
to those bridal shop homicides.

32:14.221 --> 32:17.578
- What, and eyewitnesses never went away?
- Who do you think gave you up?

32:17.653 --> 32:21.141
Oh, my old man gave me up?
Why don't you sell that to the yambos?

32:21.213 --> 32:23.869
Jimmy, are they gonna open the door
for us at that card room...

32:23.939 --> 32:27.295
sit on their hands while we grab you up,
without your dad's say-so?

32:27.370 --> 32:29.994
You know, I'd go big
with the remorse, Jimmy.

32:30.064 --> 32:34.099
Or you went nuts.
You got hysterical off those gay photos.

32:34.169 --> 32:36.728
This guy's blackmailing you.
You suddenly snap.

32:36.799 --> 32:39.456
You whack him. You shove
12 dollars up his heinie...

32:39.525 --> 32:41.416
and then you stuff him
in a garbage can.

32:41.481 --> 32:43.460
I don't know what
you're talkin' about, Officer.

32:43.534 --> 32:45.611
And then this morning at breakfast...

32:45.682 --> 32:49.367
maybe your brother requests
something from the citrus family.

32:49.434 --> 32:52.157
He mentions fruit.
Hey, you take that wrong.

32:52.225 --> 32:54.619
You blow his head off.
Now you're on a roll.

32:54.694 --> 32:56.771
Hey, up your ass, pal!
Up your ass!

32:56.843 --> 32:59.304
- Jimmy wants to get friendly.
- There's someone to see him.

32:59.377 --> 33:02.767
Why don't you come in here? We'll get
friendly together. You don't scare me.

33:02.841 --> 33:06.231
- Come on! Open the door! Let's go!
- Excuse me.

33:06.304 --> 33:07.736
- You're dead. You don't know me.
- Thanks, James.

33:08.773 --> 33:10.632
Sure.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.556
No lawyer.

33:16.567 --> 33:19.836
- Can I see him?
- We're gonna have to be in there with you.

33:19.902 --> 33:22.363
You oughta get your son
to understand the situation.

33:22.436 --> 33:25.311
The only way he helps himself
is giving his side of the story.

33:25.385 --> 33:27.244
I know what I gotta do.

33:27.310 --> 33:29.169
Raise your hands.

33:45.239 --> 33:48.793
- Where you been, Pop?
- Can he come out of there?

34:06.149 --> 34:09.058
Your mother don't stop cryin'.

34:09.132 --> 34:11.275
I'm gonna get outta this.

34:11.344 --> 34:13.257
She's cryin' about Vincent.

34:15.898 --> 34:18.359
Who's gonna represent me?

34:18.431 --> 34:21.023
All this from not telling the truth.

34:21.094 --> 34:23.686
You think you're
the first queer in the world?

34:23.755 --> 34:28.304
Your brother gets a call about pictures
showing you being queer, and you take his life?

34:28.373 --> 34:30.801
Who's gonna represent me, Pop?

34:30.875 --> 34:35.522
Getting word to that kid that drove you...
he should tell the truth.

34:35.589 --> 34:37.503
What are you doin' to me, Pop?

34:37.578 --> 34:42.322
I asked him to drive you out of town,
not to be lookout at some bridal shop.

34:42.389 --> 34:45.264
I put him in that car with you.

34:45.339 --> 34:48.478
I take responsibility for my actions.

34:48.545 --> 34:50.437
What? Putting me in jail?

34:50.503 --> 34:53.826
That's your responsibility.
What you did to innocent people.

34:59.515 --> 35:02.139
If you want,
Al Lombardi'll represent you.

35:04.614 --> 35:08.299
Ask him if your best shot
is giving a statement.

35:26.807 --> 35:30.677
Believe me, you can forget
about any statement.

35:30.751 --> 35:33.627
Al Lombardi's one of the best.

35:33.702 --> 35:36.359
Al Lombardi gets me a walk.

35:49.545 --> 35:51.884
There they go.

35:55.318 --> 35:58.226
You'll make your client available
if developments warrant.

35:58.300 --> 36:00.793
- Certainly.
- I know your client doesn't have to answer...

36:00.865 --> 36:03.719
but I am going to get an order
to produce on his.25 automatic.

36:03.784 --> 36:07.721
You can save everyone some time telling
whatever you're gonna tell me now.

36:07.793 --> 36:10.614
- It was stolen.
- Mm.

36:10.680 --> 36:14.365
- Which you never reported?
- No. I neglected to report it.

36:14.431 --> 36:16.825
- Ah.
- Just as a point of information...

36:16.901 --> 36:18.978
what got you off
the invisible burglar scenario?

36:19.049 --> 36:21.870
Did you explain to Ted him breaking
the window out onto the street?

36:21.936 --> 36:25.074
All the glass being on the sidewalk?
How that one probably wouldn't sell? Huh?

36:25.143 --> 36:27.932
- Let's go, Ted.
- Yeah, your client's got some catching up to do.

36:27.998 --> 36:30.874
- When's the last time you were sober this near dinner?
- Diane...

36:30.948 --> 36:34.698
- What do you wanna be when you grow up, Detective?
- Not like you, a whore lawyer.

36:38.966 --> 36:40.879
Somebody representing prostitutes?

36:40.954 --> 36:43.644
- Hi.
- Our table available?

36:43.712 --> 36:45.571
Sure.

36:49.933 --> 36:52.109
Excuse me.

36:52.179 --> 36:54.038
How'd it go with the D. A?

36:54.103 --> 36:56.213
I guess your mom will be
the final judge of that.

36:56.284 --> 36:58.940
Although she didn't want
to hear the terms from me.

36:59.010 --> 37:01.951
She told me to tell you
so the two of you could discuss it.

37:02.025 --> 37:05.294
- All right.
- lllegal possession of the firearm goes away.

37:05.360 --> 37:09.110
They charge the grandjury to indict her
with second-degree manslaughter.

37:09.176 --> 37:11.603
Your mother will plead guilty.
She'd get five years probation.

37:11.678 --> 37:14.947
- No jail time?
- No jail.

37:15.013 --> 37:17.473
- Thank God.
- As I said, Diane...

37:17.547 --> 37:19.788
I think she would be
acquitted at the trial.

37:19.855 --> 37:24.120
- But if it's a deal you want, it's a pretty good one.
- She's terrified of a trial.

37:24.185 --> 37:26.842
Then you should tell her
to accept the proposal.

37:26.911 --> 37:28.409
I will.

37:30.086 --> 37:32.994
I, uh, appreciate this, Miss Silver.

37:34.992 --> 37:37.868
Well, off to whore for another client.

37:41.119 --> 37:44.607
No, I don't actually...

37:52.536 --> 37:54.547
What is it, David?

37:56.384 --> 38:00.004
It's important to me you don't feel
I was being mercenary or corrupt.

38:00.072 --> 38:02.696
So now we know what's
in the conversation for you.

38:02.766 --> 38:06.451
- I was confused and angry.
- My shift's over.

38:06.518 --> 38:09.427
I did destroy those message tapes.

38:09.501 --> 38:12.355
I called the phone company to see
if there was any way to retrieve them.

38:12.419 --> 38:14.278
- There isn't.
- That's what they said.

38:14.343 --> 38:16.683
So what? You want
a gold star for trying?

38:16.749 --> 38:18.793
His lawyer told me
even if you had the tapes...

38:18.866 --> 38:20.845
you couldn't have gotten an indictment.

38:20.919 --> 38:23.193
Yeah? Well, that's what the lawyer said.

38:23.259 --> 38:27.841
He said the statements were self-contradictory
and wouldn't be usable as evidence.

38:27.909 --> 38:31.397
David, your stepfather's
lawyer makes me sick...

38:31.469 --> 38:33.383
but it's his job to make me sick.

38:33.458 --> 38:35.797
When you didn't stand up for your mother,
you weren't doing any job.

38:35.863 --> 38:37.722
You just didn't stand up.

38:37.787 --> 38:40.695
I'm not taking any money from him.
You were wrong to say that.

38:40.770 --> 38:42.946
So you weren't greedy.
Only gutless.

38:43.015 --> 38:46.984
If you've got some big reasons for that,
tell 'em to a shrink. You and me are done talking.

38:47.055 --> 38:48.914
Good night, Greg.

38:48.980 --> 38:50.838
I guess that means a drink's out.

38:50.904 --> 38:54.392
See? All that education
didn't go to waste.

39:00.205 --> 39:02.894
Bobby, five years probation.

39:02.962 --> 39:05.204
Oh, Diane, that's- that's great.

39:05.272 --> 39:08.410
Yeah. My mom's gonna be so relieved.
Dougie too.

39:08.479 --> 39:11.168
Yeah, this Miss Silver, she really
came through for you, huh?

39:11.237 --> 39:13.129
Yeah, she did.

39:13.193 --> 39:17.096
She walks in just when I'm tellin' that
shyster Ulin how all lawyers are whores.

39:17.170 --> 39:19.029
Do you have to transport Del Marco?

39:19.095 --> 39:21.588
No, there's a uniform cop.
Come on. We're outta here.

39:21.660 --> 39:24.514
- Good.
- Oh, look at this.

39:24.578 --> 39:28.001
- My favorite couple.
- What?

39:28.074 --> 39:29.987
Permit a beaten man
a little irony, Detective.

39:30.062 --> 39:32.238
- Did anyone ever tell you you talk like a sissy?
- Let's go.

39:32.308 --> 39:35.063
One of the reasons I came was to say
I hope there's no hard feelings.

39:35.130 --> 39:38.005
The position I took on your mother's case
was on instruction.

39:38.080 --> 39:40.224
Turns out I was fronting
a public relations stall.

39:40.293 --> 39:42.819
Sometimes the performers don't know
what the play is really about.

39:42.891 --> 39:45.285
All I know is my mother
didn't deserve to go to jail.

39:45.360 --> 39:47.787
As I said, I don't think my office
ever planned on going to bat.

39:47.862 --> 39:49.491
'Cause it would've been bad P.R.

39:49.561 --> 39:52.864
Otherwise, you would've been running
up there with your Louisville Slugger.

39:52.929 --> 39:57.675
Last I looked, Detective, my job specs don't
make me arbiter of who is and isn't guilty.

39:57.740 --> 40:01.096
I'm supposed to be an advocate,
just like the lawyer on the other side.

40:01.171 --> 40:05.173
It's kind of a paradox to have people say
you're amoral 'cause you're doing your job.

40:05.244 --> 40:07.518
Well, maybe if you got rid
of that smart-ass grin.

40:07.585 --> 40:10.854
Yeah. Well, it's hard not to be entertained
when you're working a system...

40:10.920 --> 40:14.408
where the detective in charge of investigating
a homicide is seeing the killer's daughter.

40:14.480 --> 40:16.820
- Whoa!
- Come here.

40:16.885 --> 40:19.378
Hey! Hey! Hey!

40:19.451 --> 40:22.272
That's twice that you said
that I looked to bag this case.

40:22.338 --> 40:24.481
- Bobby-
- I'm not one of your punk law school buddies.

40:24.550 --> 40:26.726
Mouth off again to me,
and you're gonna be spitting teeth.

40:26.796 --> 40:29.135
You're about five seconds
from me filing charges.

40:29.200 --> 40:32.689
Oh, yeah? Well, I would hate to be
in a position where I needed to use a lawyer.

40:37.795 --> 40:40.004
Where are your fives on the Tierney case?

40:40.073 --> 40:41.932
Out box upstairs.

40:45.525 --> 40:48.728
- He's a little jerk.
- Let's just get out of here, Bobby. Come on.

40:51.233 --> 40:54.240
- Good night, Sarge.
- Good night.

41:32.957 --> 41:36.030
I think I might've blown it
with that David Tierney.

41:36.100 --> 41:40.135
Fancy said we couldn't make a case
even if he would've cooperated.

41:42.257 --> 41:45.264
He kept coming on like such a victim.

41:45.337 --> 41:50.082
He's this poor puppet being yanked around
by his tragic family situation.

41:50.147 --> 41:52.291
I wanted to give him a smack.

41:52.360 --> 41:54.306
Well, that might've moved him.

41:54.380 --> 41:58.667
I should've worked with that
and let him go with it.

42:00.474 --> 42:04.826
But I couldn't. I just...

42:06.696 --> 42:09.419
I was afraid to get inside. It...

42:11.057 --> 42:13.266
I kept seeing my brother in this guy...

42:13.334 --> 42:17.019
and not wanting Dougie
to quit on himself.

42:28.279 --> 42:31.483
I'm trying so hard to believe people...

42:31.550 --> 42:34.426
don't have to be trapped
by who they are or...

42:34.501 --> 42:36.710
or how they've lived.

42:42.230 --> 42:44.886
You don't think I'm trapped, do you?

42:47.136 --> 42:48.995
No.

42:51.081 --> 42:52.940
No, I don't.

42:56.918 --> 43:00.154
Maybe I just came back to work too soon.
