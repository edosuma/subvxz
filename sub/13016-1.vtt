Yeah, that's very funny.

By 11:00 you're gonna be
snoring like a monster,

No, I'm serious.

51:45.478 --> 51:47.355
You're really stunning.

51:47.480 --> 51:49.732
This is good stuff.
I want you to keep this up.

51:49.815 --> 51:53.777
You were always
a very pretty girl in college.
There's no question about that.

[ Sighs ]
You've really grown
into a beautiful woman.

52:02.660 --> 52:05.413
How can you do that ?

52:06.789 --> 52:08.708
What ?

52:08.791 --> 52:13.003
Look at me like you
haven't seen me every day
for the last 13 years.

52:17.591 --> 52:20.510

Don't look.

out of here.

You promised.

53:51.635 --> 53:54.722
That's right.
I did promise.
Okay. All right.

53:54.805 --> 53:57.391
We're gonna stop
at the kids' shoe
department first,

53:57.516 --> 54:01.019
and then I gotta
pick up my watch
from the battery store.

54:01.144 --> 54:02.979
Then I'm gonna go
to the linen store.

54:03.063 --> 54:05.231
Why don't we go
to all the stores ?

54:05.356 --> 54:08.401
Every single store
in this god forsaken
shopping mall.

54:08.568 --> 54:10.444
Wouldn't that
be exciting ?

54:12.154 --> 54:14.823
You know what ?
Why don't I take the kids,

54:14.948 --> 54:18.827
and you just stay here
and hang out
in the men's department ?

54:18.910 --> 54:21.371
Come on, hon.

54:38.345 --> 54:41.473
It's perfect
for your frame.

54:41.598 --> 54:44.058
Why don't you try it on ?

54:47.478 --> 54:51.732
I might want to take
an inch out of the back.
Okay.

Lengthen the sleeve.

54:57.279 --> 54:59.739
You look amazing
in that suit.

wow !

55:05.286 --> 55:08.664
Off the charts, great.

55:08.748 --> 55:11.000
It's an unbelievable thing.

55:11.125 --> 55:14.962
Wearing this suit
actually makes me feel
like a better person.

55:21.426 --> 55:23.344
I'm gonna buy it.

55:26.139 --> 55:29.100
It's $2, 400.

Are you out of your mind ?
Come on, let's go.

55:32.353 --> 55:35.689

Come on.
Take it off, all right ?

We'll go to the food court
and get one of those
funnel cakes you like.

No.

[ Whispers ]
No.

55:51.829 --> 55:54.873
Do you have any idea
what my life is like ?

55:54.957 --> 55:59.628
- Excuse me ?
- I wake up in the morning
covered in dog saliva.

55:59.753 --> 56:01.671
I drop the kids off,

56:01.755 --> 56:04.465
spend eight hours
selling tires retail.

56:04.549 --> 56:06.467
Retail, Kate.

56:06.551 --> 56:10.096
I pick the kids up,
walk the dog,

56:10.221 --> 56:13.140
which, by the way,
carries the added bonus...

56:13.265 --> 56:17.227
of carting away
her monstrous crap.

56:17.394 --> 56:20.522
I play with the kids,
take out the garbage,

56:20.689 --> 56:22.565
get six hours of sleep
if I'm lucky.

Then everything starts
all over again.

that your life is such
a disappointment to you.

I can't believe it isn't
a disappointment to you!

have been a thousand times

How could you let me give up
on my dreams like this ?

when we got married.

57:11.986 --> 57:14.113
You know what ?
Maybe you're not.

57:14.196 --> 57:19.117
Because the Jack Campbell
I married would not need
a $2, 400 suit...

57:19.201 --> 57:21.620
to feel better
about his life.

if that's what it's
gonna take, then buy it.

of the kids' college fund.

of my week.

about that back in the store.

57:53.482 --> 57:55.400
I don't want to fight
with you.

what would you say
was the biggest surprise ?

Just out of curiosity.
I'm just asking.

- Well, Annie, for one.
- Surprise, we're pregnant.

Great times. Great place.

59:05.256 --> 59:07.133

You can't really raise a kid
in an apartment in the village.

Then there was the whole trek
out to the hospital.
That didn't help either.

I've got six sets
of snow tires piled up
