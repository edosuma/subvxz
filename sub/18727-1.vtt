Bamu! Bamu!

00:52.637 --> 00:55.306
Hey! Hey, Bamu!

00:55.390 --> 00:58.143
Bamu, it's me, Johnson.

00:58.226 --> 01:01.187
Bamu, Johnson come.

01:07.402 --> 01:10.363
By God, Bamu, you're a pretty girl.

01:10.447 --> 01:12.657
Beautiful.

01:12.741 --> 01:14.868
I think you have
the most beautiful breasts.

01:18.079 --> 01:20.999
Beautiful breasts.
God bless you for them.

01:23.376 --> 01:26.212
I beg how much.
Now go leave me alone.

01:26.296 --> 01:27.964
Ah, Bamu.

01:28.047 --> 01:30.508
I'm a rich man, Bamu. Rich.

01:32.427 --> 01:36.306
Aye. I never seen
such a beautiful girl.

01:40.852 --> 01:43.438
I could teach you
to be a civilized lady...

01:43.521 --> 01:45.523
and you could do no work at all.

01:46.483 --> 01:47.984

04:38.029 --> 04:39.530
Good morning, sir.

04:54.963 --> 04:57.340
Mr. Johnson, I want my money.

04:57.423 --> 04:59.050
We want that money.

05:03.638 --> 05:06.349
I will pay you soon.
Health to you.

05:06.432 --> 05:08.476
Good health. Good health.

05:11.312 --> 05:13.398
Hey! Make them stop.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.942
You no go inside. Go away!

05:20.405 --> 05:22.156
Johnson?

05:22.240 --> 05:25.660
Good morning, sir.
God preserve you.

05:25.743 --> 05:27.453
Johnson, why are you so bloody late?

05:29.330 --> 05:31.749
S-Sir, the clock is fast.

05:31.833 --> 05:33.710
The clock is stopped, Johnson.

05:33.793 --> 05:36.421
Ah, but it was fast
when it stopped, sir.

05:38.089 --> 05:41.426
Get me that PWD circular
that came in from Lagos, will you, Johnson?

05:41.509 --> 05:43.511
Yes, sir. Ten seconds, sir.

05:45.346 --> 05:46.848
Uh —

05:49.183 --> 05:52.520
The point is, Waziri,
you just can't do it.

05:52.603 --> 05:55.064
- Why not, lord?
- Because it's —

05:55.773 --> 05:57.525
It's barbaric.

05:57.608 --> 06:00.319
Oh, but i-it's been done for centuries.

06:00.403 --> 06:03.948
Damn it, Waziri,
I am not having women flogged.

06:05.616 --> 06:07.577
There's been a directive
from the governor.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.787
- But they are prostitutes.
- I don't care what they are.

06:09.871 --> 06:11.622
No flogging.

06:12.957 --> 06:16.502
What shall we do to them, Lord Rudbeck?

06:17.879 --> 06:19.589
W-Well, put them in prison.

06:19.672 --> 06:21.382
Prison?

06:21.466 --> 06:25.303
That's abominable cruelty.
They would die of shame.

06:26.304 --> 06:28.389
Well, we can't flog them.

06:28.473 --> 06:30.475
So we'll just have to think
of something else then.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.186
Well.

06:33.269 --> 06:36.022
Left, right, left, right, left.

06:38.649 --> 06:39.817
Saleh, my pet.

06:57.335 --> 06:59.337
This is the file on elephant poachers.

07:05.176 --> 07:09.222
And why in the name of God is it full
of correspondence about tobacco?

07:09.305 --> 07:11.140
Um —

07:11.224 --> 07:12.558
Uh —

07:13.518 --> 07:17.188
You say tobacco
look like elephant dropping.

07:21.192 --> 07:23.194
This is the local exports file.

07:23.694 --> 07:25.196
Yes, sir.

07:27.031 --> 07:28.533
Johnson.

07:28.616 --> 07:32.036
What on earth has Sergeant Gollup's cow
got to do with local exports?

07:32.120 --> 07:33.621
Mmm —

07:35.164 --> 07:36.624
I think the hide, sir.

07:37.125 --> 07:39.293
But the bloody cow isn't dead.

07:40.503 --> 07:42.463
But I think it going to die soon.

08:50.198 --> 08:52.450
"Thy wife shall be as fruitful...

08:52.533 --> 08:56.287
as the vine upon the walls
of thy house.

08:56.370 --> 09:00.124
Lo, thus shall a man be blessed."

09:02.126 --> 09:05.254
And wilt thou, Mr. Johnson...

09:05.338 --> 09:09.884
take this woman, Bamu,
to be thy lawfully wedded wife?

09:09.967 --> 09:12.303
Oh, yes. I certainly do.

09:13.429 --> 09:17.934
And wilt thou, Bamu,
take this man, Mr. Johnson...

09:18.017 --> 09:19.852
to be thy wedded husband?

09:27.818 --> 09:30.988
Uh, I now pronounce you man and wife.

09:33.658 --> 09:36.827
What do you go after then, Gollup? Pig?

09:36.911 --> 09:38.537
Oh, no, sir. No.

09:38.621 --> 09:42.375
No, there, uh, there aren't no pig
round here. Not now, sir.

09:42.458 --> 09:45.753
Fair bit of guinea fowl though.
Oh, yes.

09:45.836 --> 09:48.547
- Any leopard?
- There's a big one, sir.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.800
So they tell me.
Up the Bauchi Road.

09:51.300 --> 09:54.470
Uh, got himself a couple nigs —
natives, sir.

09:54.553 --> 09:56.555
Uh, only last week.

09:56.639 --> 09:58.683
I might have a go at him.

09:58.766 --> 10:03.229
I'd go with you, if I didn't have to go
on this damn tour up to Maiduguri.

10:03.312 --> 10:04.897
Perhaps in a few months, eh?

10:04.981 --> 10:06.941
Oh, right you are, sir.
Not half. Oh, yes, yes.

10:07.024 --> 10:08.943
All right.

10:09.026 --> 10:12.530
Another one of Johnson's bloody parties.
Big one too.

10:12.613 --> 10:15.825
- Oh.
- Probably going to go on all night.

10:21.372 --> 10:24.417
- Go wear your English lady dress now.
- It no good.

10:26.836 --> 10:29.255
I will make you the seat.

10:31.924 --> 10:34.760
But why not?
Now, the right thing to do —

10:49.066 --> 10:51.986
Waziri salutes Johnson, clerk of Fada.

10:52.069 --> 10:54.030
I salute Waziri.

10:54.113 --> 10:55.698
God grant you long life.

11:09.170 --> 11:12.590
So... a beautiful wife.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.258
A grand party.

11:15.259 --> 11:17.720
Expensive.

11:17.803 --> 11:20.931
But you are an important man,
clerk Johnson.

11:21.015 --> 11:24.518
I hear the new judge, Rudbeck,
is your friend.

11:24.602 --> 11:27.021
- Quite true, Waziri.
- Hmm.

11:27.104 --> 11:31.484
That you know everything
that happens in the office.

11:31.567 --> 11:33.069
Also true, Waziri.

11:33.152 --> 11:36.155
In the government, we know all orders.

11:36.238 --> 11:37.782
Mmm.

11:37.865 --> 11:42.036
Mr. Bauli,
who used to be clerk before you...

11:42.119 --> 11:44.121
he was a good friend of mine.

11:44.205 --> 11:45.706
So I have heard.

11:45.790 --> 11:48.209
And you give him 10 shillings a month.

11:48.292 --> 11:51.629
Ah, much more, clerk Johnson.
More than that.

11:51.712 --> 11:54.757
And he showed you
all the government letters.

11:54.840 --> 11:58.386
Mmm, sometimes if a letter came...

11:58.469 --> 12:00.930
about the-the emir...

12:01.013 --> 12:03.724
or the new taxes...

12:03.808 --> 12:07.061
I read it even before the judge did.

12:07.144 --> 12:10.648
You say to me,
"You belong for the king.

12:10.731 --> 12:13.526
You tell me all the king's thoughts.

12:13.609 --> 12:15.986
I give you plenty money."

12:16.654 --> 12:18.364
It is the custom.

12:18.447 --> 12:20.658
You think I be thief, Waziri?

Bamu, why you no wake me?

13:43.824 --> 13:46.202
Good-bye, Harry.
See you in a few months.

13:46.285 --> 13:48.454
Good-bye, sir.
Oh, and, uh —

13:50.080 --> 13:51.248
Oh.

13:56.003 --> 13:58.672
Now, remember what I said.
Keep an eye on the emir.

13:59.673 --> 14:02.843
- And that cunning old Waziri.
- Will do, sir.

14:02.927 --> 14:04.845
Oh, that clerk of yours, uh —

14:04.929 --> 14:07.306
- Uh, Johnson.
- Johnson. Don't trust him.

14:07.389 --> 14:10.559
Keep an eye on the whole bloody lot of 'em!

14:18.943 --> 14:20.486
I work for Lord Rudbeck.

14:22.696 --> 14:25.699
Go! Go away!

14:36.126 --> 14:39.838
Go away! Away!
I'll go pay you tomorrow!

14:39.922 --> 14:44.093
Tomorrow!

14:47.054 --> 14:49.974
What in God's name is going on here?

14:53.060 --> 14:55.729
This one owes us money.

14:58.023 --> 15:00.901
- To all these people?
- And many more, lord.

15:02.861 --> 15:04.572
What do you have to say, Johnson?

15:04.655 --> 15:07.449
These ignorant, savage people.

15:07.533 --> 15:10.578
They — They no understand that —

15:14.206 --> 15:16.917
Ah, sir. Excuse me one moment, sir.

15:23.340 --> 15:25.175
I think you wait for this, sir.

15:26.343 --> 15:28.846
Yes, by God, at last.

15:28.929 --> 15:31.056
Lord Rudbeck, sir. Our case.

15:31.140 --> 15:34.101
Yes, a-another time, I'm afraid.
I have things to do.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.978
Away, you undereducated dogs!

15:36.061 --> 15:38.856
Away! Away!

15:38.939 --> 15:42.401
Go. Can't you see
Lord Rudbeck is thinking?

15:42.484 --> 15:44.945
Away. Make they go.

15:46.864 --> 15:47.948
Excuse, sir.

15:48.032 --> 15:51.744
Maybe you could advance me
one small small portion of next pay.

15:51.827 --> 15:54.788
Sorry, Johnson, you know the rules.
You'll just have to be more prudent.

15:54.872 --> 15:57.458
Oh, I will, sir.
But I just got married, sir.

15:57.541 --> 15:59.460
Look, Johnson,
you know what'll happen.

15:59.543 --> 16:02.171
Next month, there'll be another advance
and so on.

16:02.254 --> 16:03.964
Sorry. Bad idea.

16:04.048 --> 16:06.300
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

16:20.564 --> 16:24.068
Oh, you big, bloody fool, Johnson.

16:57.935 --> 17:00.479
Johnson, why you so bloody late?

17:00.562 --> 17:03.399
Eh? Ah, go away.

18:04.001 --> 18:05.461
Sir.

18:05.544 --> 18:08.589
- You know what this is, Johnson?
- No, sir.

18:08.672 --> 18:10.340
A prismatic compass.

18:11.341 --> 18:13.802
- Isn't she a beauty?
- Oh, yes, sir.

18:13.886 --> 18:16.096
It'll make one fine road.

18:16.180 --> 18:19.183
Yeah. Great thing, a road, Johnson.

18:20.017 --> 18:21.518
Great thing.

18:22.186 --> 18:24.229
When you've made a road,
you know you've done something.

18:24.313 --> 18:26.648
You've — You've —

18:26.732 --> 18:28.275
Well, you can see it.

18:28.358 --> 18:30.569
You can see
that it's all been worth something.

18:30.652 --> 18:33.280
Yes, sir.
I agree for your beautiful road.

18:33.363 --> 18:34.948
Yeah.

18:35.032 --> 18:37.367
It's not going far, I'm afraid.

18:37.451 --> 18:39.203
No bloody money.

18:39.286 --> 18:41.455
Maybe we think of something, sir.

18:42.372 --> 18:45.459
A big road bring in plenty trade.

18:45.542 --> 18:49.046
That's it, Johnson. Precisely.

18:50.047 --> 18:53.383
Yes. Not much hope for that,
I'm afraid.

18:54.218 --> 18:57.304
You can do it, sir.
Join the big north road.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.473
The mighty road to Kano.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.226
The great north road?

19:03.310 --> 19:05.979
That's a hundred miles, Mr. Johnson.

19:06.063 --> 19:08.065
Fourteen rivers in the way.

19:09.316 --> 19:12.820
Now kindly return
to the paperwork department.

19:13.487 --> 19:15.823
Oh, yes, sir. I bring you this.

19:17.491 --> 19:20.327
Oh, yes.
That's very thoughtful of you, Johnson.

19:20.410 --> 19:22.412
Very thoughtful of you. Thank you.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.463
My friend, Lord Rudbeck and me...

19:31.547 --> 19:33.924
we are going to build a mighty road.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.676
100 miles.

19:35.759 --> 19:38.220
Oh, that's wonderful, Mr. Johnson.

19:38.303 --> 19:40.389
Only 100 miles?

19:40.472 --> 19:42.182
That should be easy.

19:42.266 --> 19:43.809
More beer, Ajali.

19:43.892 --> 19:46.645
- And your bill. What of that?
- "What of that?"

19:46.728 --> 19:49.857
More beer!

19:49.940 --> 19:51.608
You silly sod!

19:51.692 --> 19:53.694
I told you, didn't I?
I told you!

19:56.488 --> 19:58.156
You've been drinking my gin!

19:58.240 --> 20:00.242
This bloody bottle was full!
Bloody women!

20:00.325 --> 20:02.077
A man should beat his woman.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.912
Bloody Hausa women!

20:03.996 --> 20:06.248
Do you beat your wife, Mr. Johnson?

20:06.331 --> 20:08.750
In England, we do not beat our wives.

20:08.834 --> 20:10.002
- Huh.
- Hmph!

20:10.085 --> 20:11.378
I told you!

20:11.461 --> 20:14.548
♪ She round like the world,

20:14.631 --> 20:17.843

20:39.823 --> 20:41.658
But now my wife.

20:47.497 --> 20:50.834
I done tell you.
I go pay at the end of the month.

21:04.306 --> 21:07.601
Bad bad fool, Johnson. Tsk.

21:31.917 --> 21:35.963
Waziri. You fit with me
to see the Waziri?

22:09.413 --> 22:11.665
I hear your wife
gone back to her parents.

22:11.748 --> 22:14.501
Oh, no, Waziri.
She has gone to see a friend.

22:14.584 --> 22:16.128
I beg her to go.

22:16.211 --> 22:18.213
Of course.

22:19.214 --> 22:22.050
And Brimah — you owe him money.

22:22.926 --> 22:24.344
And many others.

22:24.428 --> 22:27.472
What can I do?
I haven't got a penny.

22:28.140 --> 22:32.269
I could lend you money
to pay these low rascals.

22:32.352 --> 22:36.481
Oh, Waziri.
I should thank you 10,000 times.

22:38.150 --> 22:41.153
Fetch me the aloe,
Saleh my sweet one.

22:41.987 --> 22:43.530
Can't you see I'm busy?

22:59.046 --> 23:00.839
Ah, ah. I must sign.

23:00.922 --> 23:02.549
Of course.

23:02.632 --> 23:05.260
The money is going to come
from the native treasury.

23:05.343 --> 23:06.928
But that is forbidden.

23:08.138 --> 23:10.766
- Will Judge Rudbeck see this?
- Who knows?

23:10.849 --> 23:13.143
We are all in the hands of God.

23:16.146 --> 23:18.732
Perhaps, instead...

23:18.815 --> 23:21.610
there is a small service
you could perform.

24:58.790 --> 25:02.919
"In my view, the Waziri is
the only intelligent member of the council."

25:06.089 --> 25:08.675
"As you know,
he is fluent in English.

25:08.758 --> 25:10.802
But regrettably...

25:10.886 --> 25:13.346
in both this language
and his native Hausa...

25:13.430 --> 25:16.850
he never stops plotting
and is a skillful liar.

25:16.933 --> 25:19.436
- Oh.
- You cannot trust a word he says."

25:19.519 --> 25:20.854
Oh! Terrible!

25:21.855 --> 25:24.482
Terrible!
Oh, terrible, terrible.

25:29.112 --> 25:30.864
Does the judge really say that?

25:31.448 --> 25:33.200
It gets worse.

25:33.283 --> 25:37.495
"I suspect that he shares
the emir's distaste for British advisers."

25:37.579 --> 25:40.081
- Do I read more?
- No, no, no, no.

25:40.790 --> 25:42.375
If the emir should hear this —

25:42.459 --> 25:44.961
You will get another flogging, old man.

25:45.545 --> 25:46.963
That will kill me.

25:47.047 --> 25:50.300
Last time you had to lie on your face
for seven days.

25:51.968 --> 25:54.054
So my debts will be paid?

25:54.137 --> 25:55.889
Y-Yes, of course.

25:55.972 --> 25:58.308
Oh, thank you, Mr. Johnson.

26:23.416 --> 26:25.418
Johnson.

26:26.253 --> 26:28.505
Suli tells me he's got no money
to pay the men.

26:29.005 --> 26:30.674
How much do we have left?

26:30.757 --> 26:32.259
Fourpence, sir.

26:33.343 --> 26:35.095
Fourpence?

26:35.178 --> 26:37.097
Bloody fourpence?

26:37.180 --> 26:39.182
Why in God's name didn't you tell me?

26:40.016 --> 26:42.018
But you said to tell you
when all finished, sir.

26:42.102 --> 26:43.937
Oh, for God's sake, Mr. Johnson.

26:44.020 --> 26:46.856
I wouldn't have sent a hundred men out
on a clearing job.

26:48.191 --> 26:50.068
That's about five pounds a day.

26:51.695 --> 26:53.697
Fourpence.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.408
Oh, well, that's it then.

26:58.451 --> 27:00.120
Bloody bureaucracy.

27:02.205 --> 27:05.208
Suli, tell the men
to pack up and go home.

27:05.917 --> 27:08.211
Oh, no, sir. No, sir.

27:08.753 --> 27:11.464
- I think you build the road.
- What?

27:11.548 --> 27:14.050
You take 'em
from one of the other votes.

27:15.135 --> 27:17.637
"Take 'em"? Take what?

27:17.721 --> 27:20.056
The money, sir. Look.

27:20.557 --> 27:22.434
Plenty money for uniforms.

27:22.517 --> 27:24.352
You write voucher for this...

27:24.436 --> 27:26.521
but spend it on the road.

27:26.604 --> 27:27.897
Yes?

27:29.482 --> 27:32.861
Here, sir.
The grant for the new native court.

27:32.944 --> 27:34.446
What about it?

27:34.529 --> 27:37.282
You just paint the old one.
Use the money.

27:37.365 --> 27:39.034
Government never know.

27:42.245 --> 27:43.413
Here, sir.

27:43.496 --> 27:46.082
There's 3,000 pounds left
in the treasury budget.

27:46.166 --> 27:48.585
- That's not road money though.
- No, sir.

27:48.668 --> 27:52.172
But you use it now, and next year
when the new money come...

27:52.255 --> 27:54.758
you write all the road vouchers...

27:55.425 --> 27:58.094
but the road already finish.

28:03.933 --> 28:05.810
Suli, get 'em working.

28:22.911 --> 28:24.454
Suli, through there.

28:41.805 --> 28:43.890
Merry Christmas to you, sir.

28:44.557 --> 28:46.893
Merry Christmas to you, Mr. Johnson.

28:50.563 --> 28:52.065
Here.

28:52.148 --> 28:54.192
Have a piece of plum pudding.

28:56.569 --> 28:58.071
Delicious.

28:58.738 --> 29:00.407
Thank you, sir.

29:03.827 --> 29:06.287
My mother sent it from Hertfordshire.

29:06.371 --> 29:10.375
That Hertfordshire, one of the most
beautiful village back home.

30:23.740 --> 30:26.367
Oh, darling. Ah.

30:26.451 --> 30:29.329
How are you? Mmm.
How was the trip?

30:29.412 --> 30:31.623
Well, you know.
A bit tiring.

30:31.706 --> 30:33.750
Huh?

30:33.833 --> 30:38.338
Harry, I expected to see you
at the station. In Jos.

30:38.421 --> 30:41.174
Uh, I have to build this road, you know.

30:41.257 --> 30:42.592
Before it rains.

30:43.760 --> 30:47.263
Oh. I thought we'd be in a town.

30:47.805 --> 30:50.725
Well, we will be, darling.
We're just here for a short while.

30:51.559 --> 30:53.353
We will be.

30:54.103 --> 30:57.607
- Darling, uh, this is Mr. Johnson.
- Oh.

30:59.526 --> 31:01.736
My heart is big with happiness, ma'am.

31:02.570 --> 31:04.656
All these people agree for you...

31:04.739 --> 31:06.407
too much.

31:06.491 --> 31:07.992
Thank you.

31:09.536 --> 31:11.037
How charming.

31:18.670 --> 31:22.549
Johnson made this house for you.
Otherwise, we'd be under canvas.

31:26.219 --> 31:27.554
It's-It's wonderful.

31:27.637 --> 31:29.222
Ah. Rather.

31:30.723 --> 31:32.559
And what's in here?

31:32.642 --> 31:34.644
That, ma'am, your latrine.

31:35.937 --> 31:38.147
Your own lady latrine.

31:38.231 --> 31:41.401
Oh, I see.
A kind of drawing room.

31:41.484 --> 31:43.653
- Hmm.
- Yes, ma'am.

31:43.736 --> 31:45.238
Latrine, ma'am.

31:49.659 --> 31:51.953
See, ma'am, with cover...

31:52.036 --> 31:54.497
you no catch foot in hole
in the dark.

31:54.581 --> 31:57.250
I see. Wonderful.

31:58.167 --> 32:00.003
And I scrub your seat smooth...

32:00.086 --> 32:02.714
so you no scratch your leg
at the back.

32:02.797 --> 32:06.801
Thank you, Mr. Johnson.
I think it's a beautiful arrangement.

32:10.847 --> 32:14.934
Bamu, that Mrs. Rudbeck
is a beautiful woman.

32:15.018 --> 32:17.604
Her cheeks are as white as ivory.

32:17.687 --> 32:19.981
And her breasts —
Hey, my God!

32:20.064 --> 32:25.028
Wait you see her breasts.
It big like pumpkin, the two of them.

32:25.111 --> 32:27.238
The king of England,
he say wanted to marry her...

32:27.322 --> 32:28.865
but she refused.

33:28.883 --> 33:32.512
Madam, this is
our most wonderful butcher.

34:15.263 --> 34:18.391
Settling in?
I mean, really?

34:18.975 --> 34:21.226
Yes, I'm loving it, darling.

34:21.310 --> 34:22.812
I want to enjoy Africa.

34:22.895 --> 34:24.397
Very good.

34:25.565 --> 34:28.484
- Johnson looking after you all right?
- Couldn't be sweeter.

34:28.568 --> 34:30.527
He's a perfect host.

34:37.827 --> 34:39.495
Harry, what is this?

34:40.329 --> 34:42.915
This is peanut soup.
Don't you like it?

34:44.500 --> 34:46.460
Well, it's just peanuts in hot water.

34:46.543 --> 34:48.212
Yes, I suppose it is.

35:05.772 --> 35:09.108
Perhaps you could clean your teeth tonight
having taken the pipe out of your mouth.

35:09.692 --> 35:11.569
That would be a change.

35:11.652 --> 35:14.697
- I'm sorry, Celia.
- Sorry about what?

35:15.948 --> 35:17.575
I'm sorry about all of this.

35:17.658 --> 35:19.202
Are you?

35:19.952 --> 35:21.579
You don't do anything about it.

35:21.662 --> 35:23.623
"Do"?
Well, what can I do?

35:23.706 --> 35:26.042
I'm in bloody West Africa
in the bloody bush.

35:26.125 --> 35:29.128
- This isn't Mayfair, you know.
- You don't have to tell me that.

35:29.212 --> 35:31.214
What about that horrible peanut soup?

35:32.215 --> 35:33.382
Peanut soup!

35:34.425 --> 35:37.553
Any idiot can make vegetable soup,
even in bloody West Africa!

35:37.637 --> 35:39.889
Why don't you tell Jamesu
what you want to eat?

35:39.972 --> 35:42.767
- He's not a chef at the Ritz.
- Oh, right!

35:45.228 --> 35:46.729
Damn it.

35:47.897 --> 35:50.650
You can go back home
if you think you've made a mistake.

35:50.733 --> 35:52.985
- What mistake?
- Marrying me.

35:53.069 --> 35:54.737
I know you think I'm a clod...

35:54.821 --> 35:56.989
because I read Edgar Wallace
instead of Jane Austen...

35:57.073 --> 36:01.244
and I can't tell "God Save the King"
from the-the marriage of bloody Figaro.

36:22.431 --> 36:25.017
- Oh, Ce, damn it.
- Harry.

36:25.101 --> 36:26.644
- Oh, darling.
- Harry.

36:26.727 --> 36:28.396
Please let me come in there.

36:28.479 --> 36:30.565
- Darling, I love you.
- Oh, Harry.

36:30.648 --> 36:33.067
I'm a beast, and you're working so hard.

36:38.990 --> 36:41.200
Oh, damn — Blast!

36:41.284 --> 36:43.661
- Harry, be careful!
- Oh, bloody sheet!

36:43.744 --> 36:45.663
- You're on the wrong side of it.
- Oh!

36:45.746 --> 36:47.456
Oh, tear it, Harry! Tear it!

36:47.540 --> 36:48.875
Oh!

36:55.381 --> 36:56.924
Oh, Harry, oh!

37:16.277 --> 37:18.321
Shoulder... arms!

37:20.406 --> 37:24.368
General salute.
Present... arms!

37:26.454 --> 37:28.664
Shoulder... arms!

37:31.459 --> 37:33.085
Mr. Tring.

37:33.753 --> 37:36.505
Sir, I thought you not coming
till next month.

37:36.589 --> 37:38.090
Are you clerk Johnson?

37:38.174 --> 37:40.009
- Yes, sir.
- You're late.

37:40.676 --> 37:43.429
Uh, sir, but the clock is fast.

37:43.512 --> 37:45.765
That clock has stopped.

37:48.559 --> 37:50.353
Where is Mr. Rudbeck?

37:50.436 --> 37:52.104
At the roadhead, sir.

37:52.188 --> 37:55.107
- For how long?
- One more week, I think.

37:55.191 --> 37:58.361
And you are in charge of the office
in his absence.

37:58.444 --> 38:00.071
Yes, sir.

38:00.154 --> 38:02.114
So...

38:02.198 --> 38:04.533
this is all your work.

38:04.617 --> 38:07.954
Oh, yes, sir.
I myself keep all the accounts.

38:08.037 --> 38:10.623
There seem to be
quite a few anomalies.

38:12.124 --> 38:13.793
Oh, yes, sir.

38:14.627 --> 38:19.131
The actual budget for the road
was used up last September.

38:20.508 --> 38:22.635
So how are all these payments made?

38:22.718 --> 38:24.929
Uh, from the annual budget, sir.

38:25.513 --> 38:28.182
You mean you just took
the cash you needed?

38:28.265 --> 38:31.352
Oh, yes, sir.
Every penny went on the road.

38:31.435 --> 38:33.771
And you falsified the cashbook?

38:33.854 --> 38:35.523
Oh, sir.

38:35.606 --> 38:39.026
When the new money come,
we replace all we took before.

38:39.110 --> 38:41.070
Oh, I see.

38:41.946 --> 38:43.948
You understand, Mr. Johnson...

38:44.031 --> 38:47.076
you have committed embezzlement
and forgery.

39:02.591 --> 39:05.594
Oh, wonderful.
Nothing like a woman's touch.

39:05.678 --> 39:08.597
- Settling in, Celia?
- Oh, yes. Soon I'll be an old Africa hand.

39:08.681 --> 39:11.017
Ah, not for quite a while.

39:12.018 --> 39:14.645
- Jamesu, make more —
- Pretty girl.

39:14.729 --> 39:17.481
- And get some water. Understand?
- Yes.

39:17.565 --> 39:19.942
Never had much time for women myself.

39:20.651 --> 39:22.987
- Might have missed something there.
- Yes, sir.

39:23.070 --> 39:26.490
Of course, the last thing I want
is to cause any trouble for Rudbeck.

39:26.574 --> 39:28.242
Oh, quite. Quite.

39:28.325 --> 39:30.703
But one has a certain duty...

39:30.786 --> 39:33.706
and regulations
have been so definitely ignored, sir.

39:33.789 --> 39:35.374
I understand.

39:36.292 --> 39:38.127
But then if we'd all followed regulations...

39:38.210 --> 39:40.296
I daresay we wouldn't have an empire.

39:45.134 --> 39:47.386
It's a good road, Harry. First-rate.

39:47.470 --> 39:52.016
Yes.
Well, bloody Tring has stopped it now.

39:52.099 --> 39:54.310
Yes, well, he's going by the book.

39:54.393 --> 39:56.145
There's no doubt, Harry...

39:56.228 --> 39:58.814
that Tring is an officious little —

39:58.898 --> 40:00.649
- Well, he's very zealous.
- Oh.

40:00.733 --> 40:03.319
He's quite likely
to report you to Whitehall...

40:03.402 --> 40:05.404
and that could harm your career.

40:06.906 --> 40:09.742
- What can be done?
- Well, there has to be a scapegoat.

40:09.825 --> 40:11.911
- You better sack that clerk of yours, um —
- Johnson?

40:11.994 --> 40:14.413
Johnson.
Well, he did all the books, didn't he?

40:14.497 --> 40:17.333
Yes, but he was acting for me.
I mean, it's my responsibility.

40:17.416 --> 40:20.336
He's only a clerk, for heaven's sake.
You can get another one.

40:28.052 --> 40:31.722
Have you heard, friends?
He has turned me out.

40:31.806 --> 40:34.517
That Mr. Tring. Me!

40:35.434 --> 40:38.771
Johnson, the chief clerk of Fada...

40:39.396 --> 40:41.732
and a friend of Judge Rudbeck...

40:43.442 --> 40:46.946
Now — Now I'm going to be a trader —

40:47.029 --> 40:49.031
the richest in Fada...

40:49.115 --> 40:51.283
and my wife, Bamu...

40:52.034 --> 40:55.454
will have clothes
like the queen of England...

40:55.538 --> 40:59.041
and silver bangles as big as ropes.

40:59.125 --> 41:02.378
And beads as black and shiny...

41:02.461 --> 41:04.964
as a new cashbox.

41:05.047 --> 41:08.300
And red paint for her nails
and cigarettes.

41:09.885 --> 41:11.720
Cigarettes with gold ends.

41:11.804 --> 41:14.765
Mr. Johnson. My friend.
Come now. It's all right.

41:14.849 --> 41:17.143
- It's okay, it's okay. Come here.
- Ben — Benjamin.

41:17.226 --> 41:18.811
- It's okay.
- He's turned me out.

41:18.894 --> 41:20.479
It's okay. Come on.

41:20.563 --> 41:23.190
- That Mr. Tring —
- It's all right. It's all right.

41:26.986 --> 41:29.989
Now, this cloth is from Amsterdam,
Mrs. Rudbeck.

41:30.072 --> 41:33.659
I mean, none of your rubbish here.
This is not for your natives.

41:33.742 --> 41:35.661
Seems a little bright.

41:35.744 --> 41:38.622
Yes, you're absolutely right.
It is a little bright. What good taste you have.

41:38.706 --> 41:41.083
This, for instance, I think is more you.

41:41.167 --> 41:43.752
This is the finest Egyptian cotton.
Have a feel of that.

41:43.836 --> 41:48.132
Hmm. It seems a little... coarse.

41:56.098 --> 41:57.683
- She's at sentiment, Mr. Johnson.
- Ajali?

41:57.766 --> 42:00.436
Ajali! Eh, you two.

42:00.519 --> 42:03.063
More work, less chat.

42:03.147 --> 42:05.649
- Right, you got them totals yet?
- Coming, sir.

42:11.780 --> 42:14.408
That's two shillings and eight.

42:14.491 --> 42:16.535
But minus seven.

42:16.619 --> 42:20.372
Oh, you nigs. Look, give it here.
Just give it to me.

42:20.456 --> 42:23.667
Right, now, it's seven and a half percent,
all right?

42:23.751 --> 42:25.753
- Yes.
- Now, that is seven pounds, ten shillings...

42:25.836 --> 42:28.464
in every hundred pounds, right?

42:28.547 --> 42:32.092
2,730 hides...

42:32.176 --> 42:34.261
at two shillings a hide —

42:35.888 --> 42:38.140
Sargy, the total is...

42:38.224 --> 42:40.643
273 pounds.

42:41.727 --> 42:43.604
What? You sure?

42:43.687 --> 42:45.231
Yes, Sargy. Net.

42:46.565 --> 42:48.067
Yes. Oh, yes.

42:49.068 --> 42:50.736
That's what I thought.

42:52.488 --> 42:53.989
Get on with it.

42:55.449 --> 42:58.786
This your <i>fata</i> away. They try and sell me.

42:58.869 --> 43:00.371
- No they good, oh.
- They good, oh.

43:00.454 --> 43:02.373
- They no good.
- They good.

43:02.456 --> 43:05.042
They good. They good.

43:05.125 --> 43:07.169
Look, only fit give you sixpence.

43:07.253 --> 43:09.004
- No, no, shilling.
- Shilling?

43:09.088 --> 43:11.131
- No be give you shilling for this —
- No, shilling.

43:11.215 --> 43:12.508
- Shilling for what?
- Yes.

43:12.591 --> 43:16.679
Sixpence. Look, if you no like 'em,
make you they come, carry your thing, then go.

43:16.762 --> 43:19.348
- Hmm.
- And take 'em now.

43:20.683 --> 43:22.226
- Take 'em.
- Give me the sixpence.

43:22.309 --> 43:24.311
Eh. Take 'em. Go.

43:29.608 --> 43:31.860
You just bought them hides,
have you, Johnson?

43:32.820 --> 43:34.613
Ah, yes, sir.

43:35.281 --> 43:37.116
One shilling a hide, sir.

43:37.950 --> 43:39.451
Very good, sir.

43:41.537 --> 43:43.038
Come here, lad.

43:44.039 --> 43:45.541
Come on, come on, come closer.

43:46.709 --> 43:48.711
Here, take hold of those.

43:54.717 --> 43:56.719
I did not touch you, did I?

43:57.428 --> 43:58.804
No, sir.

43:59.346 --> 44:01.307
I was in the store, wasn't I?

44:01.390 --> 44:04.351
Yes, sir. In the store.

44:04.435 --> 44:07.688
- So, what happened to you?
- My face got a blow.

44:07.771 --> 44:08.981
It what?

44:09.064 --> 44:11.400
No! I had an accident.

44:11.984 --> 44:14.528
You are a very clever geezer, Johnson.

44:14.611 --> 44:17.740
You had a accident to your nose.

44:54.651 --> 44:57.613
- Good morning, all.
- Good morning, Sargy.

44:58.781 --> 45:01.658
Lovely day. Real nice one. Oh, yes.

45:02.701 --> 45:03.701
Come here, lad.

45:05.871 --> 45:08.707
Well, come on then.
I'm not gonna bite ya.

45:11.794 --> 45:14.880
So, how are things with you today,
Mr. Johnson?

45:14.963 --> 45:18.133
Very good, sir. Thank you, sir.
I feel most well.

45:18.717 --> 45:20.719
Oh, that's good. That is good.

45:21.303 --> 45:24.431
I like you, Johnson,
but I had to thump you...

45:24.515 --> 45:27.518
because I know you are making
a tidy profit off of them hides.

45:27.601 --> 45:29.895
Now, that's all right,
because so am I.

45:29.978 --> 45:32.773
- But, Sargy, I never —
- You're a good sort, Johnson.

45:32.856 --> 45:35.567
Well, I mean, you know,
for a nigger, that is.

45:35.651 --> 45:37.861
But I mean, you can't help
what you are, can you?

45:37.945 --> 45:39.738
I mean, God made niggers, didn't he?

45:39.822 --> 45:43.158
Just the same way that he made warthogs
and dog-faced baboons.

45:43.242 --> 45:45.577
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

45:52.918 --> 45:54.461
Matumbi!

45:54.545 --> 45:57.840
Get your fat bum in here,
at the double!

46:01.969 --> 46:04.680
You're just a cow, aren't ya?
An ungrateful cow.

46:04.763 --> 46:07.683
I mean, I'm looking after you!

46:07.766 --> 46:09.393
What?

46:10.727 --> 46:12.438
You no watchum.

46:12.521 --> 46:15.816
Pay no attention. He's been drinking.
He's not an educated man.

46:15.899 --> 46:18.485
Let me tell you!

46:18.569 --> 46:21.447
- But he kill her!
- Oh, no. He will just break her arm.

46:21.530 --> 46:23.949
Or smash her face little. That's all.

46:27.786 --> 46:30.330
I'll knock your block off, sweetheart!

46:30.414 --> 46:32.416
Oh!

46:32.499 --> 46:35.169
Get out of here!
Get out of my bloody sight! Go on!

46:49.057 --> 46:51.059
You bloody nigs!

46:52.394 --> 46:55.230
You don't know what it costs us
to live here.

46:56.356 --> 46:58.817
Of course, then you ain't —

46:58.901 --> 47:01.236
you ain't got
the same kind of feelings, have ya...

47:03.780 --> 47:05.282
as a white man?

47:06.909 --> 47:08.410
Bloody nigs.

47:37.231 --> 47:38.690
Got him!

47:42.611 --> 47:44.530
Ah.

47:44.613 --> 47:46.573
My Bobby...

47:46.657 --> 47:49.159
my boy back home in England...

47:50.077 --> 47:52.120
I tell you, Johnson...

47:52.204 --> 47:54.456
he's gonna join the army like his dad...

47:54.540 --> 47:56.208
or I'll know the reason why.

47:56.291 --> 47:57.751
Oh, yes.

47:57.834 --> 48:00.921
I think he be a general, sir.
Marry a princess.

48:01.004 --> 48:04.883
He won't! Bloody brass hats? Oh!

48:05.759 --> 48:08.303
No, he'll stick with his regiment,
my Bobby...

48:08.387 --> 48:09.888
like his old dad.

48:10.931 --> 48:15.227
I mean — I mean, look what the regiment
has done for me, you know?

48:15.310 --> 48:18.480
That's right, Sargy.
You a fine man.

48:19.648 --> 48:21.316
Oh, yeah, yeah.

48:22.359 --> 48:25.654
Come and have a drink. Come on.
Come sit down and have a drink.

48:25.737 --> 48:28.824
You see, the whole trouble —
the trouble with old England is...

48:28.907 --> 48:32.077
is too much snobs with money.

48:32.911 --> 48:35.831
And the workers don't stand a chance.

48:35.914 --> 48:39.585
Mmm. Poor Mr. Rudbeck, he work.

48:40.377 --> 48:42.504
He build that great road.

48:42.588 --> 48:44.631
But that treasurer, that Mr. Tring...

48:44.715 --> 48:46.758
who got all those millions of gold —

48:46.842 --> 48:51.263
I mean, look. Just look what the army's
done for England, right?

48:51.346 --> 48:53.599
I mean, there's not
a bloody country in this world...

48:53.682 --> 48:57.352
where we have not laid down
our lives for the empire.

48:57.436 --> 48:59.771
God mind you, not that I'm complaining.

48:59.855 --> 49:01.440
Oh, no, no.

49:01.523 --> 49:03.442
No, it-it's our duty...

49:03.525 --> 49:06.445
laid down by — by God Almighty.

49:08.780 --> 49:10.282
To freedom.

49:11.116 --> 49:12.242
The empire.

49:13.201 --> 49:14.786
We English people...

49:15.537 --> 49:18.123
make freedom for all the world.

49:18.206 --> 49:21.710
Make them good schools for all people.

49:21.793 --> 49:23.754
All people learn book.

49:23.837 --> 49:25.922
Learn to agree for each other.

49:27.466 --> 49:29.635
I say it again to you, Johnson.

49:30.719 --> 49:32.512
You're too good for a nig.

49:32.596 --> 49:35.140
It is a pity you're a nig.

49:36.308 --> 49:40.812
I mean, you should have been born
one of them higher races...

49:40.896 --> 49:42.147
with intelligence.

49:42.230 --> 49:46.234

54:54.209 --> 54:55.710
What on earth is it, Waziri?

54:55.794 --> 54:58.880
Clerk Johnson has killed
the merchant Gollup.

55:07.389 --> 55:08.890
You aren't murdered then?

55:10.225 --> 55:11.768
No, I — I ain't.

55:13.061 --> 55:15.397
Well, did Johnson attack you?
Do you want to charge him?

55:15.480 --> 55:19.484
No. Oh, everything's
all right here, Mr. Rudbeck.

55:20.235 --> 55:22.487
I had a... accident.

55:23.571 --> 55:25.073
A accident to my nose.

55:28.785 --> 55:32.831
Ah, well, ah, well, uh —
That's all right then.

55:32.914 --> 55:34.416
That's all right.

55:34.499 --> 55:36.167
Good night.

55:44.426 --> 55:46.261
Well, old son.

55:46.344 --> 55:47.929
That's it, innit?

55:55.895 --> 55:58.565
I mean, I-I can't have this sort
of thing happening, can I?

55:58.648 --> 56:00.358
I mean, not in public.

56:01.484 --> 56:03.695
I mean, I've got to maintain
discipline here, haven't I?

56:03.778 --> 56:05.613
Otherwise, where would we be?

56:09.284 --> 56:12.245
I'm giving you a month in lieu.

56:20.962 --> 56:22.464
There you are.

56:24.466 --> 56:26.593
I'm-I'm real sorry about this, Johnson.
I really am.

56:26.676 --> 56:28.845
You was the best nig I ever had.

56:30.847 --> 56:33.391
I mean, treat 'em right,
I always say...

56:34.392 --> 56:36.644
and they ain't half
as black as they look.

56:40.523 --> 56:42.901
You weren't never afraid
of me, were you?

56:44.069 --> 56:47.822
No. Never afraid of you, Mr. Gollup.

58:28.173 --> 58:30.550
How many miles
had you done before the rains?

58:30.633 --> 58:32.135
Oh, about 30, sir.

58:32.218 --> 58:34.971
Um, Fada is here...

58:35.054 --> 58:37.182
- Mm-hmm?
- and we're about at this point now, sir.

58:37.265 --> 58:38.850
Well, that's very good.

58:38.933 --> 58:41.853
And trade has gone up, Harry, just as
you predicted, even though it's not finished.

58:41.936 --> 58:44.564
Uh, well, the trouble is, sir,
it looks like it might stay that way.

58:44.647 --> 58:47.025
- Hmm?
- What with that, um...

58:47.108 --> 58:49.652
- Tring controlling the vote.
- Ah.

58:49.736 --> 58:52.071
You'd think we were asking him
to spend his own bloody money.

58:52.155 --> 58:54.282
Yes. Pity.

58:54.824 --> 58:57.785
Thing is, it's the ones who can
recite the rule book in their sleep...

58:57.869 --> 58:59.871
that get the promotion.

58:59.954 --> 59:01.789
We're gonna have to be careful.

59:02.290 --> 59:05.126
Mrs. Rudbeck.
Cheers.

59:25.188 --> 59:27.190
Judge Rudbeck,
God grant you long life!

59:27.273 --> 59:30.068
How do you do, sir?

59:30.151 --> 59:33.071
The clock —
I think it fast when it stop.

59:37.367 --> 59:39.410
My God.

59:39.494 --> 59:41.621
Johnson. Ha!

59:42.830 --> 59:44.707
Mr. Johnson.

59:45.458 --> 59:48.253
What the devil have you been doing
to yourself? Lion taming?

59:48.336 --> 59:50.672
Oh, no, sir. I've been in business.

59:50.755 --> 59:52.257
Oh, yes?

59:52.340 --> 59:54.592
Tailoring business?

59:54.676 --> 59:57.637
All kinds, sir.
Any kind of business.

59:57.720 --> 01:00:00.056
But when I hear
the road start again...

01:00:00.556 --> 01:00:03.726
sir, I think I come and see you.

01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:07.063
Oh, yes, but I've only got laborers' jobs,
Mr. Johnson.

01:00:07.146 --> 01:00:09.190
I mean, sixpence a day.
You can't work for that.

01:00:09.274 --> 01:00:11.567
Oh, sir,
I like that very much.

01:00:13.861 --> 01:00:15.530
Yeah.

01:00:15.613 --> 01:00:17.657
Celia, look.

01:00:18.366 --> 01:00:19.867
It's Mr. Johnson.

01:00:44.976 --> 01:00:46.769
I done tell you, Bamu.

01:00:46.853 --> 01:00:50.189
- Mr. Rudbeck my friend.
- Mmm.

01:01:10.877 --> 01:01:14.839
Judge Rudbeck,
I pray God you slept like a baby.

01:01:14.922 --> 01:01:17.091
Thank you, Mr. Johnson.

01:01:19.177 --> 01:01:21.596
You seem to get a lot
of work out of your gang.

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:25.600
They're good men, sir.
They want to make road too much.

01:01:27.226 --> 01:01:30.688
Yeah. Drummers are a good idea.

01:01:30.772 --> 01:01:32.482
Oh, thank you, sir.

01:01:35.651 --> 01:01:37.570
Three shillings.

01:01:45.286 --> 01:01:47.413
Three shillings.

01:01:47.997 --> 01:01:50.541
- Good morning, Mr. Johnson.
- Good morning, ma'am.

01:01:50.625 --> 01:01:52.210
And what's this? For cattle?

01:01:52.293 --> 01:01:54.754
Oh, no, ma'am. This is a <i>zungo.</i>

01:01:54.837 --> 01:01:58.341
A <i>zungo</i> ? What is a <i>zungo</i> ?

01:01:58.424 --> 01:02:00.760
For people, ma'am.
Travelers on the road.

01:02:00.843 --> 01:02:02.345
They stay here.

01:02:02.428 --> 01:02:04.680
Oh, I see. It's like a hotel.

01:02:04.764 --> 01:02:06.224
Yes, ma'am.

01:02:06.307 --> 01:02:09.644
- I thought people just slept in the bush.
- Oh, no, ma'am.

01:02:09.727 --> 01:02:12.438
The bush full of lions
and leopards and —

01:02:15.358 --> 01:02:17.068
ghosts and werewolves.

01:02:17.151 --> 01:02:18.986
Ghosts and werewolves?

01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:21.531
Come now, Mr. Johnson,
you don't believe that.

01:02:22.657 --> 01:02:25.451
Oh, no, ma'am.
I an educated man.

01:02:35.586 --> 01:02:37.422
But it's going so bloody well.

01:02:37.505 --> 01:02:41.843
Harry, if the vote is used up,
the vote is used up.

01:02:43.344 --> 01:02:45.972
There's only enough money here
for another week or so.

01:02:46.055 --> 01:02:49.434
We're in striking distance
of the Kano road.

01:02:55.314 --> 01:02:56.774
Sir.

01:02:59.152 --> 01:03:00.611
Better accept it, Harry.

01:03:00.695 --> 01:03:02.905
There'll be another vote
for the road next year.

01:03:03.489 --> 01:03:04.949
We mightn't be here.

01:03:06.075 --> 01:03:08.202
We might be transferred
to another province.

01:03:09.203 --> 01:03:10.997
Someone will finish the road.

01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:14.625
And you started it, Harry.
It's your achievement.

01:03:16.294 --> 01:03:19.297
Mm-hmm.
I suppose so.

01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:22.758
Right. Well, I'm off.

01:03:23.342 --> 01:03:25.553
I'll see you all next year.

01:03:26.262 --> 01:03:28.890
Uh, full report's gone
to the governor, sir.

01:03:28.973 --> 01:03:31.726
Fine. Enjoy yourself.

01:03:31.809 --> 01:03:35.229
Absolutely.
Bye, Harry.

01:03:36.314 --> 01:03:38.107
Safe journey.

01:03:38.191 --> 01:03:41.194
Can't say I'm sorry to be getting out
of this place for a while.

01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:44.489
Mrs. Rudbeck.

01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:50.912
Bye, all.

01:04:04.550 --> 01:04:06.052
Sorry, Harry.

01:04:23.027 --> 01:04:25.738
What is it, Johnson?

01:04:25.821 --> 01:04:27.657
I think we build road, sir.

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:29.867
It's not on, Johnson.

01:04:30.826 --> 01:04:32.370
You heard him.

01:04:32.453 --> 01:04:35.748
- Maybe we don't need money.
- Oh, don't be silly, Johnson.

01:04:35.831 --> 01:04:38.543
These villagers around here aren't
gonna work for bloody nothing, you know.

01:04:38.626 --> 01:04:40.503
They're not stupid.

01:04:43.548 --> 01:04:47.426
And this great road
will make you all rich.

01:04:51.764 --> 01:04:56.143
But to share in the riches,
you must help us finish it.

01:05:01.691 --> 01:05:05.403
All workers will receive free beer.

01:05:27.842 --> 01:05:29.802
The speech is good...

01:05:30.595 --> 01:05:31.971
but the day is very hot.

01:05:32.054 --> 01:05:33.764
No one wants to work.

01:05:34.223 --> 01:05:37.977
It's a shame. Then there is
no chance to win the prize.

01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:40.605
Prize? What is this prize?

01:05:40.688 --> 01:05:44.817
The village which clears
the most bush gets the prize.

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.777
Five pounds.

01:05:46.861 --> 01:05:48.696
Five pounds?

01:05:48.779 --> 01:05:52.450
- Who gets it?
- It is paid to the chief.

01:05:53.367 --> 01:05:55.202
Oh.

01:06:09.717 --> 01:06:11.469
Down there.

01:06:50.216 --> 01:06:51.926
Get down! Get down!

01:07:45.104 --> 01:07:47.314
Mr. Rudbeck! Mr. Rudbeck, look!

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:50.401
We done joined the mighty north road.

01:09:05.267 --> 01:09:06.977

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.520

01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:44.682
Hello, Johnson.
What are you doing here?

01:09:44.765 --> 01:09:47.768
I just looking at the road, sir,
like you.

01:09:47.852 --> 01:09:49.353
Mmm.

01:09:50.645 --> 01:09:52.606
Greetings, lords.

01:09:55.109 --> 01:09:58.279
God prolong you, Waziri.

01:09:58.779 --> 01:10:00.698
Come to admire our road?

01:10:00.781 --> 01:10:02.449
The road.

01:10:04.785 --> 01:10:06.287
The road.

01:10:06.370 --> 01:10:09.540
The emir, Lord Rudbeck,
does not like the road.

01:10:09.623 --> 01:10:11.667
No? Why not?

01:10:15.129 --> 01:10:19.466
People from far away
will travel down this road to Fada.

01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:23.429
They will not know of our emir.
They will not salute him.

01:10:23.512 --> 01:10:27.391
They will bring ideas
that the emir does not like.

01:10:30.352 --> 01:10:32.187
Mmm.

01:10:32.271 --> 01:10:34.899
Who knows when the spark will be lit...

01:10:34.982 --> 01:10:37.651
or how dry it will find the grass?

01:10:39.778 --> 01:10:42.239
You don't understand, Waziri.

01:10:42.323 --> 01:10:45.242
The people must have roads.

01:10:45.326 --> 01:10:48.996
But why?
Tell me why, Mr. Johnson.

01:10:49.079 --> 01:10:51.665
Because it is civilized.

01:10:51.749 --> 01:10:55.461
With a road,
we civilize the people.

01:10:55.544 --> 01:10:59.006
But why should they be civilized,
Lord Johnson?

01:11:00.049 --> 01:11:01.884
Because —

01:11:02.468 --> 01:11:05.804
Because all men like
to be civilized.

01:11:13.479 --> 01:11:14.980
Amadu of Bauchi.

01:11:17.024 --> 01:11:19.818
Refused to repair his house wall,
which overhangs the road.

01:11:19.902 --> 01:11:21.695
Mmm?
What does he say?

01:11:21.779 --> 01:11:24.406
He said he was away trading
and his sons neglected the wall.

01:11:24.490 --> 01:11:26.659
All right.

01:11:26.742 --> 01:11:29.203
Now that he's back,
he has a week to fix the wall.

01:11:36.710 --> 01:11:39.338
Levi, a trader from Abakaliki.

01:11:41.173 --> 01:11:44.468
Assaulted the police, who arrested him
for not paying in the <i>zungo.</i>

01:11:44.551 --> 01:11:46.053
Yes?

01:11:46.136 --> 01:11:49.056
He declared he has already paid
both his <i>zungo</i> fees.

01:11:51.058 --> 01:11:52.685
Both fees?

01:11:53.394 --> 01:11:55.145
- You mean in two <i>zungos.</i>
- No, lord.

01:11:55.229 --> 01:11:57.398
Both fees in the Fada <i>zungo.</i>

01:11:58.315 --> 01:12:00.192
You mean he had cattle.

01:12:00.275 --> 01:12:04.405
No, lord. I mean the lodging fee
and the road fee.

01:12:06.156 --> 01:12:08.158
What the devil is the road fee?

01:12:08.909 --> 01:12:10.661
Ask him who he paid it to.

01:12:14.915 --> 01:12:16.917
He paid it to the road boy.

01:12:17.626 --> 01:12:19.253
Who the hell is the road boy?

01:12:19.336 --> 01:12:22.214
Lord, the small boy
who works for Mr. Johnson.

01:12:23.424 --> 01:12:24.925
Johnson?

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:42.192
Judge Rudbeck.
Good evening to you, sir.

01:12:43.277 --> 01:12:45.112
Have you been stealing <i>zungo</i> money?

01:12:45.904 --> 01:12:48.699
Oh, no, sir.
I never think of such a bad thing.

01:12:50.159 --> 01:12:52.953
This boy's been collecting
something called a road fee.

01:12:53.037 --> 01:12:55.039
A tax you invented yourself.

01:12:55.122 --> 01:12:57.541
Oh, yes, sir.
He-He make a little collection.

01:12:57.624 --> 01:12:59.626
But to buy beer
for laborers on the road.

01:12:59.710 --> 01:13:03.380
- You never took any of that money?
- Oh, sir, I forget.

01:13:03.464 --> 01:13:05.382
Maybe I borrow two or three shillings.

01:13:05.466 --> 01:13:08.635
Here.
I put it all in my cashbook.

01:13:10.262 --> 01:13:12.139
How did you pay your bill
at Gollup's store?

01:13:12.222 --> 01:13:14.516
Oh, sir, out from my pay.

01:13:17.519 --> 01:13:20.022
What about one pound, two
and sixpence for a canopy chair?

01:13:20.105 --> 01:13:23.275
Uh, perhaps I borrow
small small to pay my chair.

01:13:23.358 --> 01:13:26.028
And the suits? And that bed?

01:13:26.695 --> 01:13:30.240
Oh, God, Johnson,
you'd steal the smell off a goat.

01:13:31.825 --> 01:13:34.036
But I no steal, sir.

01:13:34.119 --> 01:13:37.581
Maybe I borrow small small.
But I pay it back.

01:13:50.803 --> 01:13:52.471
These are serious charges, Johnson.

01:13:52.554 --> 01:13:54.723
Embezzlement and <i>sojan gwona.</i>

01:13:57.017 --> 01:13:58.727
You know what that is?

01:13:59.561 --> 01:14:02.689
It's the collection of money by pretending
to be a government official.

01:14:03.857 --> 01:14:06.360
You my good friend, Mr. Rudbeck.

01:14:07.402 --> 01:14:08.904
I did it all for you.

01:14:14.076 --> 01:14:15.661
I'm not arresting you...

01:14:17.037 --> 01:14:18.997
but I want you out of here.

01:14:20.707 --> 01:14:22.209
Understand?

01:14:38.934 --> 01:14:42.688
- It's all that wretched road.
- Wretched road? What do you mean?

01:14:42.771 --> 01:14:46.191
Well, it's changing everything.

01:14:46.275 --> 01:14:49.403
Lorries, markets,
people flooding in.

01:14:49.486 --> 01:14:52.239
Look at the pressure
it put on poor Mr. Johnson.

01:14:52.906 --> 01:14:55.284
God, sleepy old Fada
will never be the same again.

01:14:55.367 --> 01:14:56.827
- Probably just as well.
- Harry!

01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:59.538
I mean it! Do you think
we should come here and say...

01:14:59.621 --> 01:15:01.415
"How quaint,"
and leave it at that?

01:15:02.249 --> 01:15:05.169
They were all happy enough.
Who asked you to change things?

01:15:09.798 --> 01:15:12.176
What is the good of roads?

01:15:16.388 --> 01:15:18.348
I spent too long
on that road, Bamu.

01:15:25.606 --> 01:15:27.232
But now...

01:15:28.317 --> 01:15:30.194
I'll go into trade.

01:15:30.736 --> 01:15:33.447
I'm going to be a rich man.

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:35.824
I a bold and daring man.

01:15:38.285 --> 01:15:41.038
Going to take care of you
and my little boy here.

01:15:44.374 --> 01:15:46.418
I love you too much, Bamu.

01:15:47.628 --> 01:15:50.505
I love you stronger
than the tree grows.

01:15:51.006 --> 01:15:53.467
I love you more
than the sun fills the air.

01:16:09.483 --> 01:16:10.901
Nothing has happened.

01:16:27.167 --> 01:16:28.669
What are you doing?

01:16:31.004 --> 01:16:33.423
- But she's my wife.
- She my sister.

01:16:33.507 --> 01:16:36.260
Bamu, you no want to go.

01:16:42.266 --> 01:16:44.601
I'm just about to make you rich.

01:16:50.941 --> 01:16:53.193
Stop! Stop.

01:16:53.277 --> 01:16:54.820
Please, wait small small time.

01:16:54.903 --> 01:16:57.447
I know how I go get
all the money where I owe you.

01:16:57.990 --> 01:17:00.325
Brimah, please.

01:17:00.909 --> 01:17:04.621
Bamu, I go buy you a-a new bed.

01:17:04.705 --> 01:17:07.541
A bed of gold,
with silver legs.

01:17:07.624 --> 01:17:11.878
And the net gonna be of fine silver thread,
all laced together.

01:17:12.963 --> 01:17:15.424
Please, stay here.

01:17:49.958 --> 01:17:52.836
They say Judge Rudbeck
has turned you out.

01:17:52.919 --> 01:17:56.715
It is false. I left my work
on the road. That's all.

01:17:56.798 --> 01:17:58.675
Is that so?

01:17:58.759 --> 01:18:01.386
Waziri, I need small small money.

01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:03.305
Money? From me?

01:18:03.388 --> 01:18:07.559
Waziri,
after all I have done for you.

01:18:07.642 --> 01:18:09.186
The judge's letters.

01:18:09.978 --> 01:18:12.564
But the judge has dismissed you.

01:18:13.231 --> 01:18:14.941
What can you do for me now?

01:18:20.072 --> 01:18:21.782
You rubbish.

01:18:21.865 --> 01:18:24.201
Coming here so late
with such nonsense!

01:18:30.749 --> 01:18:33.043
Beat him. Don't kill him.
Just cripple him.

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:17.123
You stay right where you are,
you thieving —

01:21:37.018 --> 01:21:38.728
Here!

01:21:38.812 --> 01:21:41.565
Here, what you... playin' at?

01:21:56.663 --> 01:21:58.123
What on earth is it, Waziri?

01:21:58.206 --> 01:22:01.084
Clerk Johnson has killed
the merchant Gollup.

01:22:02.252 --> 01:22:04.713
Oh, God. Not again.

01:22:04.796 --> 01:22:07.841
Tell your men to contact —

01:22:07.924 --> 01:22:09.926
and report any strangers in the area —

01:22:11.845 --> 01:22:13.513
Yes, sir.

01:23:15.659 --> 01:23:17.118
Bamu!

01:23:21.539 --> 01:23:23.083
Bamu!

01:23:45.897 --> 01:23:48.817
Bamu, I'm hungry.

01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:50.860
I haven't eaten anything for days.

01:24:04.499 --> 01:24:06.126
Thank you.

01:24:27.147 --> 01:24:29.816
Mmm.
You're a good wife, Bamu.

01:24:29.899 --> 01:24:32.652
The best wife in Africa.

01:24:32.736 --> 01:24:34.654
Okay, make you chow finish.
Make you the go.

01:24:40.326 --> 01:24:42.537
I no want make my brother see you.

01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:46.082
Waziri say he gonna give big money
to any person where find you gone.

01:24:46.958 --> 01:24:51.129
- Bamu, one day I will —
- No, no, Mr. Johnson.

01:24:51.212 --> 01:24:52.714
Make you the go.

01:25:19.783 --> 01:25:22.744
- Get up, you son of a dog!
- I'm not the son of a dog.

01:25:22.827 --> 01:25:24.579
I'm an English gentleman.

01:25:24.662 --> 01:25:26.664
And no English gentleman
would walk barefoot...

01:25:26.748 --> 01:25:28.708
through a disgusting town.

01:26:01.157 --> 01:26:03.535
<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

01:26:03.618 --> 01:26:06.079
<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

01:26:07.455 --> 01:26:10.208
Mr. Johnson! Mr. Johnson!

01:26:10.291 --> 01:26:13.336
- Mr. Johnson.
- Mr. Johnson.

01:26:13.419 --> 01:26:16.756
Mr. Johnson!

01:26:19.425 --> 01:26:21.177
- Mr. Johnson!
- Johnson!

01:27:07.056 --> 01:27:08.808
Mr. Johnson.

01:27:11.477 --> 01:27:14.480
Saleh. What do you do here?

01:27:15.106 --> 01:27:18.735
That old man, the Waziri,
he was always touching me.

01:27:18.818 --> 01:27:20.320
I pushed him away.

01:27:20.403 --> 01:27:22.906
He got angry and says I am a thief.

01:27:22.989 --> 01:27:24.490
It is all a lie.

01:27:24.574 --> 01:27:26.409
Amazing.

01:27:27.243 --> 01:27:30.371
The Waziri's friend.
Hey!

01:27:30.455 --> 01:27:32.373
Wonderment.

01:27:32.457 --> 01:27:36.586
This boy used to possess such power,
and now —

01:27:37.712 --> 01:27:39.714
It makes you think, oh.

01:27:39.797 --> 01:27:41.758
Poor Saleh.

01:27:41.841 --> 01:27:44.594
Johnson, my feet hurt
with the rough ground.

01:27:44.677 --> 01:27:46.137
Give me your shoes.

01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:50.016
- My best English shoes?
- Don't be so cruel and selfish.

01:27:50.683 --> 01:27:52.435
What good are they to you?

01:27:52.518 --> 01:27:54.604
In two days, they will hang you.

01:28:24.217 --> 01:28:26.302
Quiet.

01:28:27.136 --> 01:28:29.138
Quiet.

01:28:35.687 --> 01:28:37.146
Go on, Johnson.

01:28:37.230 --> 01:28:40.858
Oh, sir, I guilty.
I kill poor Sargy Gollup.

01:28:40.942 --> 01:28:43.152
Don't write that, Muhammad.

01:28:43.236 --> 01:28:44.862
Don't plead guilty.

01:28:45.571 --> 01:28:49.033
Not guilty.
We'll call it not guilty.

01:28:49.117 --> 01:28:52.412
I guilty.
I think I save you trouble.

01:28:52.495 --> 01:28:54.831
- Did you mean to kill him then?
- Oh, no, sir.

01:28:54.914 --> 01:28:56.499
I agree for him too much.

01:28:56.582 --> 01:28:58.793
I didn't want to hurt Sargy one little bit.

01:28:58.876 --> 01:29:02.296
But before,
you said you picked up the paper file...

01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:04.424
and stabbed him.

01:29:04.507 --> 01:29:08.052
Oh, sir, I just didn't think
what I was doing with that thing.

01:29:08.136 --> 01:29:11.139
Johnson,
I want you to understand.

01:29:11.222 --> 01:29:14.142
If you plead the killing was an accident,
that's one thing.

01:29:14.225 --> 01:29:17.645
But if you lost your head,
that's another.

01:29:18.563 --> 01:29:20.773
A thief who kills
to get himself out of a corner...

01:29:20.857 --> 01:29:23.776
is still guilty
of murder in the first degree.

01:29:26.654 --> 01:29:29.615
♪ I got a little girl ♪

01:29:30.491 --> 01:29:33.453
♪ I got a little girl ♪

01:29:33.995 --> 01:29:35.955
♪ She round like the world ♪

01:29:36.039 --> 01:29:37.999
♪ She smooth like the water ♪♪

01:30:12.325 --> 01:30:14.160
All right, let me see.
Uh —

01:30:14.243 --> 01:30:18.414
We know the coins
are 25 pounds each...

01:30:19.248 --> 01:30:20.833
and the jam is—

01:30:20.917 --> 01:30:23.086
Or what is it? Peas.

01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:26.672
Peas are 11 pounds, so —

01:30:26.756 --> 01:30:28.508
How much I weigh, sir?

01:30:29.092 --> 01:30:32.887
Fifteen —
Well, I make it, uh...

01:30:33.513 --> 01:30:35.348
10 stone, seven.

01:30:35.431 --> 01:30:37.266
That looks about right.

01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:38.851
Why you weigh me, sir?

01:30:39.435 --> 01:30:41.062
Regulations, Johnson.

01:30:42.021 --> 01:30:44.482
- Take those off, will you, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

01:30:44.565 --> 01:30:46.109
Excuse me, sir.

01:30:46.192 --> 01:30:48.319
I beg your pardon for troubling you.

01:30:49.737 --> 01:30:51.531
You gonna hang me, sir?

01:30:51.614 --> 01:30:53.282
Who said anything about that?

01:30:53.366 --> 01:30:56.077
Nobody, sir.
I guessed myself.

01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:58.037
You my good friend.

01:30:58.538 --> 01:31:00.540
You my father and my mother.

01:31:01.207 --> 01:31:03.668
I think, perhaps, you shoot me.

01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:07.505
I no like hang.

01:31:07.588 --> 01:31:10.299
I'm sorry, Johnson.
I have to obey the law.

01:31:10.383 --> 01:31:13.886
I shall have to sign a piece of paper
to say that I carried it out exactly.

01:31:16.556 --> 01:31:20.518
General salute, present... arms!

01:31:35.241 --> 01:31:37.660
Shoulder... arms!

01:32:28.002 --> 01:32:29.503
Ajali!

01:32:30.379 --> 01:32:32.215
Mr. Benjamin!

01:32:33.090 --> 01:32:36.135
- God give you health.
- Good day, Mr. Johnson.

01:32:36.219 --> 01:32:39.055
Morning, Mr. Johnson.
God prolong —

01:32:40.556 --> 01:32:42.016
God give you peace.

01:32:45.394 --> 01:32:47.104
Here.

01:32:48.064 --> 01:32:49.565
Whiskey!

01:32:49.649 --> 01:32:52.318
From England.
From home.

01:32:54.779 --> 01:32:56.989
The best whiskey in the world.

01:32:57.073 --> 01:33:01.577
Uh —
Mr. Rudbeck, he-he came to the store.

01:33:01.661 --> 01:33:03.412
He said that
we should give that to you.

01:33:03.496 --> 01:33:05.248
But why should he —

01:33:05.331 --> 01:33:07.833
Of course,
he's going to hang me today.

01:33:09.210 --> 01:33:11.295
He is too good to me.

01:33:11.379 --> 01:33:13.631
Uh, drink some whiskey, Mr. Johnson.

01:33:13.714 --> 01:33:16.759
No, no. You have it.

01:33:16.842 --> 01:33:18.344
You my friends.

01:33:29.021 --> 01:33:30.523
It will cheer you up.

01:33:31.315 --> 01:33:32.900
But I'm cheerful.

01:33:32.984 --> 01:33:34.944
I don't care to take anything.

01:33:36.028 --> 01:33:37.655
You have it.

01:33:40.574 --> 01:33:43.828
I say this, Mr. Johnson:
You brave.

01:33:45.121 --> 01:33:48.582

01:33:49.208 --> 01:33:50.960

01:33:52.128 --> 01:33:54.297

that advance you asked for?

01:34:52.188 --> 01:34:53.731
Oh, yes, sir.

01:34:54.607 --> 01:34:56.650
If I had given it to you...

01:34:57.485 --> 01:34:59.320
would it have made any difference?

01:34:59.403 --> 01:35:03.532
Sir, I'm much more bad
than even you think.

01:35:04.283 --> 01:35:06.202
