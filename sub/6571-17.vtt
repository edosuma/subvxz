00:02.335 --> 00:05.395
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

00:05.505 --> 00:07.496
<i>and the one son who had no choice...</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:09.598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:15.148 --> 00:16.843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:19.886 --> 00:23.344
<i>Michael Bluth had set up</i>
<i>a meeting with Cal Cullen...</i>

00:23.456 --> 00:26.254
<i>owner of one of the largest</i>
<i>parcels ofland in Orange County.</i>

00:26.359 --> 00:29.590
I hope that I can prove to you
that we have a very impressive company.

00:29.696 --> 00:33.530
Well, your family did not come off well
on last night's <i>Scandalmakers.</i>

00:33.633 --> 00:35.533
<i>[Narrator]</i>
Scandalmakers <i>was a show...</i>

00:35.635 --> 00:38.103
<i>that reenacted</i>
<i>headline-grabbing stories.</i>

00:38.204 --> 00:40.104
<i>The latest was</i>
<i>about the Bluth family...</i>

00:40.206 --> 00:42.470
<i>the rights of which had been</i>
<i>signed away by Tobias...</i>

00:42.575 --> 00:45.442
<i>in exchange for the part of George Sr.</i>

00:45.545 --> 00:49.208
<i>[Show Narrator] When allegations</i>
<i>surfaced he'd illegally built homes in Iraq...</i>

00:49.315 --> 00:52.113
<i>George Bluth Sr.,</i>
<i>assisted by his secretary, Kitty...</i>

00:52.218 --> 00:54.118
<i>escaped the country.</i>

00:54.220 --> 00:58.281
<i>[Narrator] Due to poor acting, the burden</i>
<i>of the story was placed on the narrator.</i>

00:58.391 --> 01:02.020
<i>[Show Narrator] Only to be found hiding</i>
<i>under one of the homes that he built.</i>

01:02.128 --> 01:04.891
<i>[Narrator] He was actually found</i>
<i>in a hole near the house...</i>

01:04.998 --> 01:07.592
<i>but this inattention</i>
<i>to detail was typical...</i>

01:07.700 --> 01:10.965
- <i>of the laziness the show's</i>
<i>narrator was known for.</i>
- I can't survive under the house.

01:11.071 --> 01:14.131
Perhaps an attic shall I seek.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.640
<i>[Narrator] Real shoddy narrating.</i>
<i>Just pure crap.</i>

01:16.743 --> 01:19.644
But we're back on track,
and we are scandal-free.

01:19.746 --> 01:23.443
<i>Hey! You start</i>
<i>the meeting without me?</i>

01:23.550 --> 01:27.680
Mother, uh, this is Cal Cullen.
You remember my mother, Lucille.

01:27.787 --> 01:30.255
We're right in the middle of talking...

01:30.356 --> 01:32.620
about this exciting giveaway
spa package to entice buyers.

01:32.725 --> 01:34.920
You know, he's never taken me anywhere.

01:35.028 --> 01:37.997
Oh, no. We have to live high and dry.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.123
Well, you're certainly not dry.

01:40.233 --> 01:44.829
<i>Michael, I'm not a prude, but it's 1:00</i>
<i>in the afternoon. Is your mother drunk?</i>

01:44.938 --> 01:48.032
<i>I'd have to get up pretty early</i>
<i>to get drunk by 1:00. [Laughing]</i>

01:48.141 --> 01:50.632
<i>[Narrator] As it turns out,</i>
<i>she had gotten up early...</i>

01:50.743 --> 01:54.179
<i>and had taken pain medication</i>
<i>because of a hangover-related headache.</i>

01:54.280 --> 01:58.148
<i>However, she mistook</i>
<i>the "drowsy eye"alcohol warning...</i>

01:58.251 --> 02:01.743
<i>for a "winking eye"alcohol suggestion.</i>

02:01.855 --> 02:05.882
<i>Fortunately, she had the good sense</i>
<i>not to drive herself to the meeting.</i>

02:05.992 --> 02:08.256
No. I'll call for a car.

02:08.360 --> 02:13.025
<i>Unfortunately, this was</i>
<i>after a failed attempt to do so.</i>

02:13.133 --> 02:15.533
- <i>[Thud]</i>
- Who the hell put-

02:15.635 --> 02:18.729
<i>Michael, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I cannot do business with you.</i>

02:18.838 --> 02:21.568
I mean, I couldn't afford
to end up on <i>Scandalmakers.</i>

02:21.674 --> 02:24.643
Oh, you could afford to do anything
you want. You're just a big chicken.

02:24.744 --> 02:29.647
<i>[Animated Clucking]</i>

02:29.749 --> 02:31.649
<i>[Clucking Stops, Loud Thud]</i>

02:31.751 --> 02:33.651
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Michael realized it might be time...</i>

02:33.753 --> 02:35.812
<i>to deal with his mother's</i>
<i>apparent problem.</i>

02:35.922 --> 02:38.982
Okay, that seems as good a place
as any to end the meeting.

02:42.462 --> 02:44.760
No, I'm not doing another
intervention with her.

02:44.864 --> 02:46.923
Last time, I felt terrible for a week.

02:47.033 --> 02:50.230
<i>[Narrator] One year earlier,</i>
<i>the family had tried an intervention.</i>

02:50.336 --> 02:53.237
- You're pouring a drink? What are you doing?
- What if she's mad?

02:53.339 --> 02:56.240
- Good point.
- Perhaps I'll have a little sip of something.

02:56.342 --> 02:58.572
Guys, what could she do to us?

02:59.879 --> 03:02.040
Do we have anything single malt?

03:02.148 --> 03:05.049
<i>[Narrator] And although</i>
<i>the intervention didn't work</i>- 

03:05.151 --> 03:08.348
- We think you have a "prollen."
- You're a mesh.

03:08.454 --> 03:11.423
<i>[Narrator] It turned into one</i>
<i>of the Bluth family's better parties.</i>

03:11.524 --> 03:14.084
[Laughing, Muttering]

03:14.194 --> 03:17.391
[All Laughing]

03:19.666 --> 03:22.066
<i>[Michael] Well, maybe an intervention</i>
<i>is the wrong approach.</i>

03:22.168 --> 03:24.568
What about rehab?
She was just a mess at the meeting.

03:24.671 --> 03:27.435
Where were you, by the way?
I could've used your help with Mom.

03:27.540 --> 03:31.271
I believe I told you I was gonna be out
for the holidays. It's spring break.

03:31.377 --> 03:34.073
Not that I can enjoy it.
My reputation's been ruined...

03:34.180 --> 03:38.207
by that jerk Phillip Litt, who put
my one magic show flub on his DVD.

03:38.318 --> 03:41.082
<i>[Narrator] Gob had performed a magic act</i>
<i>at an earlier spring break...</i>

03:41.187 --> 03:44.554
<i>to get exposure on the</i>
<i>best-selling video series...</i>

03:44.657 --> 03:46.625
<i>Girls with Low Self-Esteem.</i>

03:49.329 --> 03:50.990
Or two flubs or whatever.

03:51.097 --> 03:52.997
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>There were seven flubs...</i>

03:53.099 --> 03:55.294
<i>and after the show,</i>
<i>he signed a release.</i>

03:55.401 --> 03:59.235
- You're not gonna use the time
that I screwed up, right?
- That wasn't part of the act?

03:59.339 --> 04:02.035
- Come on, man.
I'd never do anything to embarrass you.
- <i>[Squawking]</i>

04:02.141 --> 04:04.041
- Please.
- <i>[Crunching]</i>

04:05.378 --> 04:09.178
Oh. Uh, you don't know
a good bird hospital, do you?

04:09.282 --> 04:11.182
You're getting all this, right?

04:11.284 --> 04:15.015
<i>Well, at least the</i> Orange County Register
<i>didn't say of your performance...</i>

04:15.121 --> 04:19.023
"If this is who George Sr. Is,
let's hope he remains missing."

04:19.125 --> 04:22.060
Meanwhile, they loved
Dave Attell's risky choice...

04:22.161 --> 04:24.721
of wearing cutoffs
while portraying me.

04:24.831 --> 04:26.992
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>In fact, Mr. Attell was portraying...</i>

04:27.100 --> 04:29.660
<i>Tobias's actual never-nude affliction...</i>

04:29.769 --> 04:32.237
<i>but this perplexed</i>
<i>the</i> Scandalmakers <i>audience...</i>

04:32.338 --> 04:36.240
<i>due to the unfocused nature</i>
<i>of the narrator's explanation.</i>

04:36.342 --> 04:39.903
No, I think mine's worse. You should've seen
what happened to me on the boardwalk today.

04:40.013 --> 04:42.538
They were laughing at me. Me!

04:42.649 --> 04:44.913
[Stifled Laughing]

04:45.018 --> 04:48.215
Those tapes are awful.
Women tricked into taking their tops off.

04:48.321 --> 04:51.017
I have a daughter I don't want
corrupted by the media.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.785
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Unbeknownst to Lindsay...</i>

04:52.892 --> 04:54.985
<i>Maeby was a fairly prominent</i>
<i>member of the media...</i>

04:55.094 --> 04:59.861
<i>as she had secretly conned her way</i>
<i>into a job as a film executive.</i>

04:59.966 --> 05:01.866
This <i>Young Man on the Beach</i>
script sucks.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.902
She'd go to the guy just
'cause he said she's awesome?

05:04.003 --> 05:06.699
- You call that dialogue?
- Hey, I didn't write it.

05:06.806 --> 05:10.333
No, but you're gonna fix it. It's a spring break
movie. Find out what they sound like.

05:10.443 --> 05:13.378
Oh, yeah, right. Do you really
think I look college-aged?

05:13.479 --> 05:16.710
I'm not drunk.
But I'm willing to be. Hint.

05:16.816 --> 05:20.149
Oh, Mort, you're gonna be
so easy to blackmail. Hint.

05:24.257 --> 05:27.988
This pig Phillip Litt is out there
asking girls to take their tops off.

05:28.094 --> 05:32.121
- It's an outrage.
- Well, of course you feel that way. You're jealous.

05:32.231 --> 05:35.496
You're a surfboard.
But I do agree he is a pig.

05:35.601 --> 05:37.501
Hey! What the hell was that for?

05:37.603 --> 05:39.867
Can we stop worrying about girls
with low self-esteem...

05:39.972 --> 05:43.066
and start focusing on sobering up
the woman who gave us ours?

05:43.176 --> 05:47.510
- What do you think about rehab?
- She won't go willingly. I can tell you that.

05:47.613 --> 05:51.242
May I make a suggestion?
Get implants. Really.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.512
Wha- Come on!
This stuff is expensive!

05:53.619 --> 05:56.918
<i>[Narrator] So Michael set out to convince</i>
<i>his mother that she needed help.</i>

05:57.023 --> 05:59.924
Hello? Hello?
I have a surprise for you.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.187
- Did I win the prize?
- You won the prize.

06:02.295 --> 06:06.095
I won the prize!
I won the prize! For what?

06:06.199 --> 06:08.690
We were gonna give
one employee a week at the spa.

06:08.801 --> 06:11.361
We were even gonna put them
in the ad, but then I thought...

06:11.471 --> 06:13.871
"What about Mom?
She's elegant. She deserves it."

06:13.973 --> 06:16.203
I was gonna tell you at the office,
but then I thought...

06:16.309 --> 06:20.746
"No. If I bring her around now,
she might vomit on the overhead projector."

06:20.847 --> 06:24.874
I'm so embarrassed about that. I don't think
I was supposed to drink with my medication.

06:24.984 --> 06:27.919
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Actually, it wasn't even</i> her <i>medication.</i>

06:28.020 --> 06:30.454
Of course, I can't take Oscar
to an elegant place.

06:30.556 --> 06:33.821
His only remaining pair of pants
blew apart the other day.

06:33.926 --> 06:36.759
I was thinking that I would
go with you for the week.

06:36.863 --> 06:40.959
So what? I just stay here alone? I'm not
exactly equipped to run this place by myself!

06:41.067 --> 06:43.126
You can't just
leave me here alone!

06:44.170 --> 06:46.570
- [Beeping]
- Have a great trip.

06:46.672 --> 06:50.073
<i>[Narrator] But it wouldn't turn out</i>
<i>to be a great trip at all.</i>

06:50.176 --> 06:52.838
Hello. Welcome to Shady Pines Rehab.
Just sign right here.

06:52.945 --> 06:55.709
Rehab? This isn't a spa.
This isn't a spa!

06:55.815 --> 06:58.409
- Come here. Wait. Get her. Come here, Mom!
- We got a runner!

06:58.518 --> 07:01.453
<i>[Narrator] As Michael's mother</i>
<i>was being held against her will...</i>

07:01.554 --> 07:05.081
<i>George Sr. Was about to be confronted</i>
<i>with a similar problem.</i>

07:05.191 --> 07:07.091
Kitty. How'd you find me?

07:07.193 --> 07:10.754
I thought you were dead
until I saw <i>Scandalmakers!</i>

07:10.863 --> 07:14.629
They got so much wrong. But something
about your son-in-law's comment...

07:14.734 --> 07:19.330
<i>"Perhaps an attic shall I seek,"</i>
<i>had the ring of truth to it.</i>

07:19.439 --> 07:21.498
<i>[Narrator] Notice it</i> wasn't
<i>something the narrator said.</i>

07:21.607 --> 07:26.601
- You abandoned me in Mexico!
- Kitty, honey, l-I know you're mad.

07:26.712 --> 07:29.442
Stop talking, George.
You stop talking!

07:29.549 --> 07:32.780
I am in charge now.
You're coming with me.

07:32.885 --> 07:35.376
No, I can't. I ca-
I have a life here.

07:35.488 --> 07:38.787
There are people who-
who depend on me.

07:38.891 --> 07:41.325
Fine. But I can't make
any promises...

07:41.427 --> 07:44.362
about what happens to that
cooler of evidence I have.

07:44.464 --> 07:48.366
If I could just have
a moment to say good-bye.

07:50.403 --> 07:52.303
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Meanwhile, at the banana stand...</i>

07:52.405 --> 07:54.635
<i>Maeby was hoping to find</i>
<i>some witty banter...</i>

07:54.740 --> 07:57.140
<i>with which to authenticate</i>
<i>her feature film.</i>

07:57.243 --> 07:59.768
I want the hot chick to serve me.

07:59.879 --> 08:02.177
What other words would you
use to describe me?

08:02.281 --> 08:04.249
- Um, she's 15, and she's my cousin.
- So?

08:04.350 --> 08:07.979
So you can't touch
your cousin- my cousin.

08:08.087 --> 08:10.180
You know, you don't
have to stick around.

08:10.289 --> 08:13.986
I could just work late tonight. It doesn't
matter, 'cause my girlfriend, she's out of town.

08:14.093 --> 08:15.993
She's actually kind of lucky in the end...

08:16.095 --> 08:18.586
'cause all these guys
would be coming on to her.

08:18.698 --> 08:21.360
Yeah, you really
dodged a bullet there.

We have hats. You have breasts.

08:31.210 --> 08:33.576
You show your breasts,
you get a hat, okay?

08:33.679 --> 08:37.240
So if anyone wants to get back
at Daddy, now's the time.

08:37.350 --> 08:41.844
- Whoo! Wait. Cut, cut.
We got a surfboard in the shot.
- <i>Surfboard. Stop tape.</i>

08:41.953 --> 08:44.548
We're here to stop you from
taking advantage of these girls.

08:46.659 --> 08:49.856
You know what? You're sassy. You're sexy.
You speak your mind. There's nothin' hotter.

08:49.962 --> 08:53.796
- Give her a hat, Barry.
- I don't want a hat.
I want you to leave these women alone.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.868
I'm giving them a chance
to be idolized...

08:55.968 --> 08:58.198
which is an opportunity these women
are never gonna have again.

08:58.304 --> 09:00.431
- I want to be ideolized.
<i>- Yeah, you do!</i>

09:00.540 --> 09:04.203
- [Crowd Cheering]
- Eileen, stop it.
You've got nothing to gain from that.

09:04.310 --> 09:06.904
That's easy for you to say.
You already have a hat.

- [Squealing]
<i>- [Phillip] Come on, girls!</i>

09:09.482 --> 09:12.781
This is no way to get

10:35.768 --> 10:37.895
We'll take good care of you
here at Shady Pines.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.904
I'll take care of you,
you son of a-

10:40.006 --> 10:43.373
Shady Pines is a wonderful
facility up there on the hill.

10:43.476 --> 10:47.310
- You know, they used to film <i>Sugarfoot</i> up there.
- No?

10:47.413 --> 10:50.473
- Were you a fan of <i>Sugarfoot?</i>
- I loved it.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.448
<i>[Narrator]</i>
Sugarfoot <i>had been off the air...</i>

10:52.551 --> 10:54.712
<i>12 years before Michael was born.</i>

10:54.820 --> 10:57.983
Sing the theme song
of <i>Sugarfoot</i> along with me.

11:00.559 --> 11:02.390
- Yes

11:07.833 --> 11:10.233
Oh, what the hell.
You're a good kid.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.236
- [Elevator Bell Dings]
- Let's make the deal.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.238
- Oh, great. I've got papers-
<i>- Michael!</i>

11:14.340 --> 11:17.468
Remember me? Perhaps
this'll jog your memory.

11:17.576 --> 11:20.704
- [Cal] Oh! They're crooked.
- I've kidnapped your father, Michael...

11:20.813 --> 11:23.008
and I have a cooler full of evidence...

11:23.115 --> 11:25.413
that will bring down
this corrupt company.

11:25.518 --> 11:30.217
Unless your mother meets me
today at 4:00 at Señor Tadpole's.

11:30.322 --> 11:33.553
Spring break. Whoo!

11:38.564 --> 11:42.625
- Dad?
- <i>[Narrator] Michael's father</i>
<i>hadjust been kidnapped.</i>

11:44.970 --> 11:46.801
- <i>[Cell Phone Rings]</i>
- Hello?

11:46.906 --> 11:50.137
<i>And then he received a call that</i>
<i>his brother had been found drunk.</i>

11:50.242 --> 11:52.039
No, I'm fine. I'm telling you.

11:52.144 --> 11:55.375
For the first time, I realize that
maybe I am better off without her!

11:55.481 --> 11:58.712
- Yeah, well, we've gotta bring her back.
- Oh, thank God!

11:58.818 --> 12:01.082
So if we want to get
that evidence back, and Dad...

12:01.187 --> 12:03.212
Kitty is insisting
on a meeting with Mom.

12:03.322 --> 12:06.723
- What can Mom do for her?
- I don't know. I've gotta get
my hands on that evidence.

12:06.826 --> 12:08.726
Problem is I just
checked her into rehab.

12:08.828 --> 12:10.989
They're not exactly gonna
let me take her to a bar.

12:11.097 --> 12:13.565
<i>So, Gob, I need you to help me</i>
<i>sneak her past the guards.</i>

12:13.666 --> 12:17.432
Well, gee, I didn't think the woman I'd be
checking out at spring break would be Mom.

12:17.536 --> 12:20.266
- She's better looking
than the whores you date.
- Don't call my escorts whores.

12:20.372 --> 12:22.897
- Mom's still got it!
- I don't date whores!

12:23.008 --> 12:26.466
Stop it! Stop it! This objectification
of women has to stop!

12:26.579 --> 12:29.241
- It's just Mom and whores.
- No, how would you like it?

12:29.348 --> 12:31.248
Actually, that's not a bad idea.

12:31.350 --> 12:34.410
I should turn the tables on men
and see how they like being objectified.

12:34.520 --> 12:38.422
- Men with low self-esteem. Get their clothes off.
- That is a great-

12:38.524 --> 12:41.789
[Groans]
That is a great social statement.

12:41.894 --> 12:45.955
<i>I shall get the video camera.</i>
<i>This is ripe for parody.</i>

12:46.065 --> 12:48.329
This is ripe!

12:48.434 --> 12:52.336
<i>Hejust wants to see</i>
<i>boys'Linuses. Oh, God.</i>

12:55.107 --> 12:57.007
Here we go.

12:57.109 --> 13:01.307
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And so Michael went back to see his mom.</i>

13:01.413 --> 13:03.244
<i>[Michael]</i>
<i>L- I know that you're upset with me...</i>

13:03.349 --> 13:05.943
<i>because I brought you here</i>
<i>under false pretenses...</i>

13:06.051 --> 13:08.178
- <i>but I really was worried about you.</i>
- Oh, please.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.278
I've been drinking
since before you were born.

13:10.389 --> 13:13.358
So if alcohol is the reason I'm here,
I've got news for you, bub.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.359
It's the only reason you're here too.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.656
Hey, you're mean sober too.

13:17.763 --> 13:20.061
<i>Uh, listen. I need your help.</i>

13:20.166 --> 13:23.329
Kitty has shown up,
and she got ahold of Dad.

13:23.435 --> 13:25.903
She found him in the attic?

13:26.005 --> 13:29.964
They had a rerun of <i>Scandalmakers</i>
last night. Everybody figured it out.

13:30.075 --> 13:32.066
She would like to meet you at a bar.

13:32.178 --> 13:36.137
She says she's got some evidence that could
bring the business down if you don't go.

13:36.248 --> 13:38.148
You're sending me into a bar?

13:38.250 --> 13:41.378
Are you sure you can trust me
to make decisions for myself?

13:41.487 --> 13:43.580
I just need you to find
out what she wants...

13:43.689 --> 13:45.680
while I check all the local
motels for Dad.

13:45.791 --> 13:47.850
<i>All right.</i>
<i>But here's what I want.</i>

13:47.960 --> 13:49.928
A spa weekend with you.
A real one.

13:50.029 --> 13:52.497
I want to spend
spring break with you.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.860
You have high self-esteem, right?

13:56.969 --> 13:58.869
Not after being in here.
It's a nightmare.

13:58.971 --> 14:03.032
<i>Michael, Mom. We've gotta go now.</i>
<i>I created a diversion.</i>

14:03.142 --> 14:04.905
You're gonna love this.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.035
I'd like to check my uncle in
for rehab.

14:07.146 --> 14:09.046
I thought we were
buying me some pants.

14:09.148 --> 14:12.049
Oh, of course you think that.
You're high as a kite!

14:12.151 --> 14:15.348
He needs help! Any-
He needs help! He needs help!

14:18.624 --> 14:22.526
<i>[Narrator] And so Lucille was able</i>
<i>to meet with Kitty at Señor Tadpole's.</i>

14:22.628 --> 14:24.892
I want what's due to me-
a Bluth son.

14:24.997 --> 14:27.397
And I know
you have the material.

14:27.499 --> 14:30.195
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Kitty was right. Ten years earlier...</i>

14:30.302 --> 14:33.829
<i>George Sr. Was taking an</i>
<i>experimental hair growth drug.</i>

14:33.939 --> 14:36.032
<i>Fearing damage to his fertility...</i>

14:36.141 --> 14:38.974
<i>he froze a specimen</i>
<i>ofhis reproductive material...</i>

14:39.078 --> 14:42.241
<i>in case he ever wanted</i>
<i>another child.</i>

14:42.348 --> 14:44.407
<i>Soon, news came out that the drug...</i>

14:44.516 --> 14:46.746
<i>although somewhat successful...</i>

14:46.852 --> 14:49.980
<i>wreaked havoc</i>
<i>on the central nervous system.</i>

14:53.292 --> 14:57.058
<i>So what do you need me for?</i>
<i>He's not taking the monkey drug anymore.</i>

14:57.162 --> 15:00.154
- And you're the one who's got him. Not me.
- Oh, you know why.

15:00.266 --> 15:03.394
He won't touch me. He said
he doesn't cheat on his wife anymore.

15:03.502 --> 15:05.070
- He said that?
<i>- [Bartender] Drinking contest!</i>

15:05.070 --> 15:07.334
- He said that?
<i>- [Bartender] Drinking contest!</i>

15:07.439 --> 15:10.431
<i>Tell you what.</i>
<i>I'll drink you for it.</i>

15:10.542 --> 15:13.807
Oh, I heard you don't handle
your booze so well anymore.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.813
So this should be easy for you.

15:18.784 --> 15:21.480
That one didn't count.

15:21.587 --> 15:24.988
<i>[Narrator] And Michael met up with Gob</i>
<i>to try and find their father.</i>

15:25.090 --> 15:27.251
I got it.
From the banana stand freezer.

15:27.359 --> 15:30.260
The exact same kind of cooler
that's in the photo with Dad.

15:30.362 --> 15:33.024
- What do we need another cooler for?
- Ah, poor Michael.

15:33.132 --> 15:35.123
You do not think like a magician.

15:35.234 --> 15:37.361
- Such a "How'd he do dat?"
- Uh-huh.

15:37.469 --> 15:40.131
It's a classic bait and switch.
This is a decoy cooler.

15:40.239 --> 15:43.470
We take it in, switch it with the one
from the photo and get out of there.

15:43.575 --> 15:46.442
Kitty comes back. Everything's normal.
It's like we were never there.

15:46.545 --> 15:50.481
- But Dad's gone.
- Long gone. But it buys us
all the time in the world.

15:50.582 --> 15:53.676
I got it back, Mikey.
The self-confidence. I am a magician!

15:53.786 --> 15:55.879
I'm saying, when Kitty comes back,
notices Dad's gone...

15:55.988 --> 15:58.923
first thing she's gonna do is check
the cooler, see if the evidence is still there.

15:59.024 --> 16:00.924
Buys us, like, one second.

16:01.026 --> 16:02.960
- I am a worthless magician.
- Not true.

16:03.062 --> 16:04.791
- I can't even do one simple trick.
- Come on.

16:04.897 --> 16:07.024
- I'm covered in sweat. Look at me!
- It's a great trick.

16:07.132 --> 16:10.727
- Would've been flawless
if you had a decoy Dad too.
- Damn it.

16:10.836 --> 16:14.135
And I used a guy that looked
just like him in my last bait and switch.

16:14.239 --> 16:18.903
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

16:19.011 --> 16:21.172
- Well, I'm no longer needed here.
- No, no, no.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.180
I think the cooler's
actually gonna help us.

16:23.282 --> 16:25.477
The extra second that it buys us
could be the difference.

16:25.584 --> 16:28.849
Great. Just give me a couple
of minutes to catch my breath.

16:28.954 --> 16:31.684

<i>Lucille, minutes out of rehab...</i>

. Let me know when you're ready, dear.
<i>- [Man] She's mixing!</i>

16:46.205 --> 16:48.002
<i>While right outside the bar</i>- 

16:48.107 --> 16:50.337
I know what the shape
of a banana reminds you of...

16:50.442 --> 16:52.706
and I know that when I say
"nuts," it makes you giggle.

16:52.811 --> 16:55.712
- [Giggling]
- But do you have any other response...

16:55.814 --> 16:58.612
to "here's a banana with nuts"?

16:58.717 --> 17:01.242
[Laughing]

17:01.353 --> 17:04.378
Why are we even going after
this idiot demographic?

17:04.490 --> 17:07.653
Don't you get it? They're not even eating these.
They just like saying bananas and nuts.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.694
And I won't- I won't tell you why.
That's your father's job.

17:10.796 --> 17:13.356
<i>Come on! Let's see</i>
<i>some bananas and nuts!</i>

17:13.464 --> 17:16.194
Oh, perhaps we should
just pull their pants off.

17:16.300 --> 17:19.236
Hey, what the hell do you think
you're doing? This is where we shoot.

17:19.338 --> 17:21.965
Yeah, well, you've got competition now,
'cause we're making our own video.

17:22.074 --> 17:24.372
Will you just get over it!
It's nudity.

17:24.476 --> 17:27.036
Just because you're ashamed of your body
doesn't mean everybody should be.

17:27.146 --> 17:31.310
Oh, really? Well, let's see how you feel
about what you're packing.

17:31.417 --> 17:34.750
[Lindsay]
You're a- [Bleeps] never-nude?

17:34.853 --> 17:38.118
<i>You're asking girls to take their tops off,</i>
<i>and you can't even be naked?</i>

17:38.223 --> 17:43.092
- I've gotta get this.
- Lindsay, I've already got it.

17:44.329 --> 17:47.787
I'm back into cutoffs. Lindsay?

17:47.900 --> 17:49.800
I didn't see you at the convention.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.336
- No, I was in Germany. I teleconferenced in.
- Ohhh.

17:52.438 --> 17:54.929
- Did you go to the seminar on chafing?
- Dr. Schoenweiss. Yes.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.941
This is never gonna work. There's
too many people, too many rooms.

17:58.043 --> 18:00.409
Michael, we can't give up.
This is important.

18:00.512 --> 18:04.243
Believe me. I'd rather be down at the beach
having drinks, howling at chicks.

18:04.349 --> 18:05.748

18:05.851 --> 18:07.341

Oh, my boys. Yes, you-

Yeah, hi, Dad. Uh, Gob's gonna get you
out of those handcuffs. Can you do it?

- Come on. This is disgusting.

18:29.875 --> 18:32.776
- I'm doing this for you.
- <i>[Narrator] This continued for some time...</i>

18:32.878 --> 18:34.971
<i>while Michael switched out the coolers.</i>

18:35.080 --> 18:37.446
- Why are you switching out the coolers?
- It buys us time, Dad.

18:37.549 --> 18:39.676
- What? Like a second?
- <i>Don't worry about it, okay?</i>

18:39.785 --> 18:42.618
When I get this evidence out of here,
I'm turning it right into the court.

18:42.721 --> 18:45.952
Are you kidding? I don't care if the evidence
gets out there. It gets me off the hook.

18:46.058 --> 18:48.549
- What are you saying? This exonerates you?
- <i>I told you before.</i>

18:48.660 --> 18:53.324
I was a patsy. I was set up.
I am tired of looking guilty.

Look, I don't want to ruin your fun,

19:15.521 --> 19:18.217
You're better than that.
To me, anyway. You're-

- Awesome?
- No, I was gonna say you're-

you're like this flower,

to see you get plucked...

that you're blossoming.

19:29.168 --> 19:32.160

Truthfully, that wasn't part of the act.

to come out of my mouth.

That part was very surprising, but I'm talking
about how you helped me get Dad out of there.

Thanks to you, this family
could end up being okay.

Not anymore. Not anymore.
