00:03.504 --> 00:04.630
/Tracy Jordan to the stage, please.

00:04.796 --> 00:07.341
/Tracy to the stage.

00:07.508 --> 00:08.842
Hey, hey, hey,
where are you going?

00:09.009 --> 00:10.093
They've been paging you
for rehearsal!

00:10.260 --> 00:11.803
Rehearsal?
We did a show last week.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.222
I just came
to pick up a paycheck.

00:13.388 --> 00:15.724
No. We do a show
every Friday, Tracy.

00:15.891 --> 00:16.808
It's not gonna work.

00:16.977 --> 00:19.260
Next Friday is Damon Dash's
birthday party.

00:19.433 --> 00:21.851
And the Friday after that there's an orgy over
at Elizabeth Hasselbeck's.

00:22.027 --> 00:23.193
Yeah? Well, you're part
of a team now, okay?

00:23.359 --> 00:25.772
So you have to be in the shows
and you have to rehearse.

00:25.949 --> 00:28.403
And when you rehearse,
Jenna would really like it--

00:28.576 --> 00:29.362
I would like it too--

00:29.536 --> 00:31.783
if you would read exactly
what's on the cue cards.

00:31.945 --> 00:33.202
It's making everybody crazy.

00:33.368 --> 00:34.363
Can't do it.

00:34.536 --> 00:35.911
I'm an improviser.

00:36.077 --> 00:38.082
My acting style is like jazz.

00:38.245 --> 00:41.620
Jazz that you laugh at.

00:43.968 --> 00:46.003
"Ah ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha ha!"

00:46.177 --> 00:48.133
Just try, okay?

00:48.295 --> 00:51.340
I have a meeting upstairs.
I'll be right back.

00:51.517 --> 00:52.010
Pete.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.053
Do you remember that song
I recorded last year

00:54.225 --> 00:55.842
when I was dating
that Persian record producer?

00:56.018 --> 00:57.181
Oh...no.

00:57.345 --> 00:59.350
It's a dance-pop techno hybrid
called Muffin Top.

00:59.516 --> 01:00.850
I gave everybody copies
at Christmas?

01:01.018 --> 01:02.852
Oh, yeah, right.
I don't remember that.

01:03.037 --> 01:06.523
Well, apparently
it's a number-one hit in Israel.

01:06.698 --> 01:08.771
Hey, Israel.
Wow. Yes.

01:08.945 --> 01:10.443
And I noticed we had
a couple of minutes left,

01:10.615 --> 01:11.942
so I thought maybe
I could do it on the show.

01:12.117 --> 01:13.242
Okay, you can do the short version.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.740
You should know that Muffin Top
is also number four in Belgium.

01:15.906 --> 01:16.610
I said you could do it.

01:16.786 --> 01:19.323
Why not?!

01:19.498 --> 01:22.831
Oh. I mean, thank you.

01:29.335 --> 01:30.133
Hello.

01:30.295 --> 01:35.632
For over a hundred years,
GE has been imagining the future... today.

01:35.806 --> 01:40.180
And I'm here to talk to you today
about a wonderful new synergy.

01:40.357 --> 01:44.313
It's called "product integration."

01:44.475 --> 01:48.690
It's revolutionizing the way
we monetize broadcast television.

01:48.855 --> 01:50.693
How does it work?
Simple.

01:50.865 --> 01:54.282
All you have to do
as the writing staff of an NBC show

01:54.446 --> 02:00.950
is incorporate positive mentions--
or PosMens--of GE products into your program.

02:01.127 --> 02:05.250
For example, you could write an episode
where one of your characters purchases--

02:05.418 --> 02:08.830
and is satisfied with...

02:09.588 --> 02:15.553
one of GE's direct-current drilling motors
for an offshore or land-based project.

02:15.718 --> 02:17.262
Product integration...

02:17.427 --> 02:21.723
setting a new standard
in upward revenue stream dynamics.

02:21.897 --> 02:24.720
For all of us.

02:28.105 --> 02:30.400
Now, I'd be happy
to answer any questions.

02:30.565 --> 02:34.482
I'm sorry. You're saying you want us
to use the show to sell stuff?

02:34.656 --> 02:35.980
Look, I know how this sounds.

02:36.155 --> 02:37.570
No, come on, Jack.
We're not doing that.

02:37.746 --> 02:40.360
We're not compromising the integrity
of the show to sell--

02:40.538 --> 02:41.663
Wow. This is diet Snapple?

02:41.828 --> 02:43.743
I know, it tastes just like
regular Snapple, doesn't it?

02:43.918 --> 02:45.540
You should try
Plum-A-Granate.

02:45.708 --> 02:46.540
It's amazing.

02:46.705 --> 02:48.661
I only date guys
who drink Snapple.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.420
Look, we all love Snapple.

02:50.586 --> 02:52.710
Lord knows I do,
but focus here.

02:52.888 --> 02:54.672
We're talking about product integration.

02:54.847 --> 02:56.552
No, no. We are not your shills.

02:56.715 --> 02:58.760
Oh! Oh-ho.
I'm sorry.

02:58.926 --> 03:00.472
That's right.
They're artists,

03:00.636 --> 03:02.430
like James Joyce
or Strindberg.

03:02.598 --> 03:03.301
Get real, kids.

03:03.478 --> 03:07.603
You write skits mocking our presidents
to fill time between car commercials.

03:07.778 --> 03:08.771
That's not fair.

03:08.935 --> 03:13.940
Josh gets a lot of fan mail
for Gaybraham Lincoln.

03:16.286 --> 03:18.780
Did you guys know that Holland
is the only country with a national dog?

03:18.945 --> 03:19.571
I didn't know that.

03:19.747 --> 03:24.033
Hmm. There's little facts under there.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:40.348 --> 03:41.762
/That's  a lunch break, everybody.

03:41.937 --> 03:45.351
Back in an hour, please.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.521
Um, did you talk to Tracy
about reading the cue cards?

03:48.686 --> 03:49.311
I tried.

03:49.477 --> 03:51.063
Well, he's not reading them.

03:51.238 --> 03:52.732
He never reads them, Liz.

03:52.907 --> 03:56.112
I'm starting to think...
he can't read!

03:56.276 --> 03:58.651
Oh, that-- that's just offensive, Jenna.

03:58.827 --> 03:59.743
I don't know.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.032
Have you ever seen him
read anything?

04:01.205 --> 04:03.411
Of course.
Like when we shoot promos.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.532
Hi. I'm Tracy Jordan.
I'm black, NBC!

04:06.705 --> 04:10.663
Very proud, like peacocks,
right, Janet?

04:10.838 --> 04:13.083
Hmm.

04:13.546 --> 04:15.500
Hey, Tracy,
I missed that last run-through.

04:15.678 --> 04:19.510
Could you run it once
off cards for me?

04:19.675 --> 04:24.383
Naw, Lemon.
I'll do that later.
I gotta bounce.

04:24.558 --> 04:27.640
Okay, that's the--

04:27.976 --> 04:31.811
It says, "Emergency exit only".
He couldn't read that?

04:31.987 --> 04:34.851
Man, Jenna's really gotten squirrelly
since Tracy came along.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.102
It's so sad.

04:36.275 --> 04:39.153
What's really sad is that
while she's in this fragile state,

04:39.328 --> 04:41.650
none of her friends
are messing with her head.

04:41.828 --> 04:43.703
I think we should do
something about that.

04:43.867 --> 04:44.743
Hmm.

04:44.915 --> 04:46.661
Shh. Okay.
All right.

04:46.827 --> 04:48.663
Hey, what are you guys
talking about?

04:48.835 --> 04:50.083
Oh. Uh...nothing.

04:50.245 --> 04:52.081
What, is it about me?

04:52.256 --> 04:53.791
Okay. Um...

04:53.966 --> 04:58.172
There's a rumor going around
that Donaghy has to cut costs around here.

04:58.348 --> 04:58.750
Oh.

04:58.927 --> 05:01.880
Yeah. My friend in accounting,
Lando Calrissian,

05:02.056 --> 05:05.262
he says Jack's probably gonna
have to fire an actor.

05:05.438 --> 05:06.340
Oh.

05:06.515 --> 05:10.311
Thank you guys for telling me.

05:17.406 --> 05:19.192
It's like shooting fish
in a barrel.

05:19.368 --> 05:22.071
Yeah, if the fish have daddy issues.

05:22.237 --> 05:25.072
I can't believe you guys actually
wrote a product integration sketch.

05:25.248 --> 05:26.703
Jack said we had to.

05:26.865 --> 05:27.912
It just seems weird.

05:28.077 --> 05:30.410
This show's not a commercial.

05:30.585 --> 05:31.160
Excuse me.

05:31.338 --> 05:33.911
Can you tell me
where Human Resources is, please?

05:34.087 --> 05:35.873
That way. Thanks.

05:36.048 --> 05:38.791
This is gonna sound crazy, but, um...

05:38.966 --> 05:40.501
Tracy can read, right?

05:40.675 --> 05:41.130
What? Are you serious?

05:41.305 --> 05:42.593
The  guy's done dozens of movies.

05:42.756 --> 05:46.882
Yeah, but it's not like his movies seem
like he's reading a script.

05:47.058 --> 05:49.300
Let's go rescue Karen
or whatever.

05:49.476 --> 05:51.312
Is there a Cheryl?

05:51.478 --> 05:54.602
Then  she could tell us where drugs are--
I mean gold--

05:54.776 --> 05:58.850
Then we got the car chase.
I'm getting way too old for this!

05:59.028 --> 06:01.061
Was I supposed to say that then?

06:01.235 --> 06:01.943
That's true.

06:02.116 --> 06:03.942
And he never reads
the cue cards...

06:04.115 --> 06:07.281
God, I thought all that stuff was just crazy Tracy seeing
what he could get away with.

06:07.455 --> 06:09.243
I know, but, you know,
it's not surprising.

06:09.418 --> 06:10.992
Look at the educational system
in this country.

06:11.165 --> 06:13.120
We spend all this money in Iraq,
but meanwhile,

06:13.298 --> 06:17.370
our inner-city graduation rates
are lower than they are in the Sudan.

06:17.545 --> 06:18.792
That doesn't sound right.

06:18.967 --> 06:23.461
Maybe it was Sweden.
Maybe it was teen pregnancy.

06:23.637 --> 06:26.720
I gotta read more.

06:30.393 --> 06:31.051
What can I do for you?

06:31.227 --> 06:33.643
So we wrote a product integration sketch.

06:33.819 --> 06:35.852
Good. But we wanted to run it
by you first

06:36.029 --> 06:38.643
because it's about
how GE is making us do this.

06:38.816 --> 06:45.192
And we were kinda hoping that the GE executive
in the sketch could be played by...you.

06:45.367 --> 06:47.150
Oh, I get it--

06:47.326 --> 06:48.782
The whole self-referential thing:

06:48.955 --> 06:50.661
Letterman hates the suits,
Stern yells at his boss,

06:50.825 --> 06:54.080
Nixon's "sock it to me"
on Laugh-In.

06:54.246 --> 06:55.450
Yeah.

06:55.628 --> 06:57.203
Hippy humor.

06:57.375 --> 06:58.660
That's what I'm going for.

06:58.836 --> 07:00.292
Well, as you know,
I've been studying comedy

07:00.467 --> 07:01.502
and learning what's funny.

07:01.675 --> 07:04.210
I'm watching Friends right now.
What happens with Ross and Rachel?

07:04.387 --> 07:06.962
No, no. Don't tell me.
Seriously. What were you saying?

07:07.138 --> 07:08.382
So will you do it?

07:08.557 --> 07:09.760
I don't know, Lemon.
I'm not an actor.

07:09.935 --> 07:11.470
This is your world.

07:11.645 --> 07:12.853
Oh, come on.
You can do this.

07:13.015 --> 07:13.891
You were great in that video.

07:14.057 --> 07:14.851
Yeah!

07:15.018 --> 07:17.563
This is live television.

07:17.727 --> 07:22.231
I've never done anything
like that before.

07:24.275 --> 07:25.272
Okay, I'll do it.

07:25.446 --> 07:27.322
Ohh! Great, great.
Thanks, Jack.

07:27.485 --> 07:29.243
So rehearsal will be
tomorrow at 2:00.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.362
Please don't be late.

07:30.537 --> 07:34.493
And I will fax you
any changes by 9:00 a.m.

07:34.668 --> 07:35.662
You're such a Monica!

07:35.846 --> 07:38.751
Ah ha!
You are.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.343
Uhh.

07:51.518 --> 07:54.051
He never reads anything.

07:54.226 --> 07:56.682
Uh, why is Jack Donaghy
on the cast list?

07:56.858 --> 07:58.313
Oh, he's gonna do
this GE sketch.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.273
It's really funny.

07:59.438 --> 08:02.562
Oh, so he gets to be in sketches,
but he's gonna fire one of the real actors?

08:02.737 --> 08:03.231
What?

08:03.407 --> 08:07.363
I got inside information that Jack is gonna fire
one of the actors to cut costs.

08:07.527 --> 08:08.693
No. I haven't heard anything like that.

08:08.868 --> 08:09.441
Don't worry about it.

08:09.616 --> 08:11.033
Oh, I'm not worried...

08:11.205 --> 08:13.363
Because I have something
the other actors don't.

08:13.537 --> 08:14.951
A secret weapon.

08:15.126 --> 08:17.243
Oh, don't say your sexuality.

08:17.418 --> 08:18.701
My sexuality!

08:18.878 --> 08:22.120
Oh, God, Jenna,
when has that ever worked?

08:22.295 --> 08:24.330
Uh, when has it not worked?

08:24.507 --> 08:26.132
It'll be a 45-minute wait.

08:26.296 --> 08:29.000
Oh, will it?

08:30.846 --> 08:31.470
Uh, yeah.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.592
Yeah. Yeah, it will.

08:33.765 --> 08:37.390
Yeah, but this is different
because I know Jack Donaghy.

08:37.556 --> 08:39.011
I know what he likes.

08:39.188 --> 08:45.523
Yeah, so now you just have to make yourself
ten years younger and Asian.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.361
I don't know
what to tell you.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.981
They're making me rehearse.

08:50.158 --> 08:53.613
I know Pat Benatar
rarely performs live.

08:53.787 --> 08:56.990
Scalp the damn tickets.

08:57.165 --> 08:59.160
These are the changes
for the sketches that you're in.

08:59.338 --> 09:03.413
Cool. I'll read those later, Lemon.

09:05.465 --> 09:08.711
Tray...
Can you read?

09:09.808 --> 09:11.300
Can I read?

09:11.466 --> 09:12.461
Please don't get angry.

09:12.638 --> 09:15.342
It's  not your fault.
It's the system.

09:15.518 --> 09:17.052
Did you ever see
Hoop Dreams?

09:17.225 --> 09:18.052
It's like that.

09:18.227 --> 09:20.353
So you're asking me
if I'm illiterate?

09:20.515 --> 09:22.101
You don't even have to answer me
if you don't want to.

09:22.276 --> 09:25.190
Just know that if you need a tutor,
we will get you a tutor.

09:25.357 --> 09:28.312
If you need to be in fewer sketches
until you get more confident,

09:28.485 --> 09:30.861
we'll accommodate you,
whatever you need.

09:31.025 --> 09:34.401
So I could, like,
leave work early if I need a tutor?

09:34.577 --> 09:37.242
Absolutely.
We'll work around your schedule.

09:37.416 --> 09:40.162
I can't read,
Liz Lemon!

09:40.337 --> 09:41.952
My shameful secret is out.

09:42.127 --> 09:46.831
Now you know why I'm always running
into the ladies' bathroom.

09:47.007 --> 09:49.003
I can't read!

09:49.176 --> 09:52.422
I sign my name with an X!

09:52.598 --> 09:56.932
I once tried to make mashed potatoes
with laundry detergent!

09:57.098 --> 09:59.851
I think
I voted for Nader!

10:00.018 --> 10:02.393
Nader!

10:03.315 --> 10:06.061
I feel as though a great weight
has been lifted off of me, Liz Lemon.

10:06.235 --> 10:08.901
Today is the first day
of the rest of my life.

10:09.067 --> 10:12.611
All thanks to one very,
very special white lady.

10:12.776 --> 10:16.282
I'll be in late tomorrow.

10:21.918 --> 10:27.212
Damn, George Will just gets more
and more conservative.

10:31.087 --> 10:32.132
Liz?

10:32.298 --> 10:33.710
Hi. Did you tell Jack
he can be on the show?

10:33.888 --> 10:35.552
Yeah, he was kind of
excited about it, actually.

10:35.717 --> 10:36.840
Oh, yeah,
he's very excited.

10:37.016 --> 10:38.973
But you cannot put him on live TV.

10:39.136 --> 10:39.931
Why?

10:40.096 --> 10:41.550
Okay.

10:41.728 --> 10:47.273
I'm only showing you this
because I care about him so much.

10:50.198 --> 10:50.943
GE Promo.

10:51.106 --> 10:54.111
Take one.
Action!

10:54.576 --> 10:56.113
- Did you say, "Action"?
- Yes. Action!

10:56.285 --> 10:57.240
- Could you say it louder, please?
- I'm sorry.

10:57.405 --> 10:58.360
Action!

10:58.535 --> 10:59.662
GE Promo.
Take two.

10:59.826 --> 11:03.033
Hello.
For over a hundred years--

11:03.205 --> 11:03.950
Line?

11:04.126 --> 11:05.540
Sorry.
My bad.

11:05.708 --> 11:06.791
What's the first line?

11:06.957 --> 11:08.252
Product integration!

11:08.415 --> 11:10.710
Okay.

11:11.127 --> 11:13.133
Right, got it.
I just need the first word.

11:13.296 --> 11:15.752
Product!

11:16.676 --> 11:17.423
What's the second word?

11:17.595 --> 11:18.342
Integration.

11:18.518 --> 11:19.802
Okay, I knew that.
Okay, d-d-uh...

11:19.975 --> 11:21.681
If I ask for the line again,
don't tell me.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.721
Line?

11:23.896 --> 11:25.470
- Line?
- Product integration.

11:25.646 --> 11:28.101
I told you don't give me the line
when I ask for the line.

11:28.276 --> 11:30.271
I got it.
I got it.

11:30.447 --> 11:31.232
Could we get a do-over there?

11:31.407 --> 11:32.600
Let's go again, can we?

11:32.775 --> 11:34.232
What?

11:34.405 --> 11:35.692
What is it?

11:35.868 --> 11:36.482
I don't like this at all.

11:36.657 --> 11:38.690
Okay, I got it.
Let's go again.

11:38.868 --> 11:40.742
The pen doesn't really write.
Does that matter?

11:40.908 --> 11:44.123
And I'm here today--

11:44.707 --> 11:46.241
My bad.
I'm sorry.

11:46.415 --> 11:47.952
Oh...God.

11:48.127 --> 11:49.663
Why don't we go to lunch
and we'll come back and maybe--

11:49.836 --> 11:51.170
Let's all go have lunch.

11:51.337 --> 11:53.003
GE  Promo.
126.

11:53.177 --> 11:54.543
It's weird.
What do I do with my arms?

11:54.716 --> 11:55.961
I've never thought
about that before.

11:56.137 --> 11:58.802
Is it this?

11:59.847 --> 12:02.973
Or, if I may, this?

12:05.685 --> 12:07.260
Maybe I should just hold something.

12:07.438 --> 12:08.772
OK, yeah, this feels more natural.

12:08.937 --> 12:10.311
Is that right? Yeah.

12:10.486 --> 12:12.942
"New synergy"--
does that sound odd to anyone else?

12:13.107 --> 12:15.023
Does that sound like
"news energy"?

12:15.198 --> 12:16.613
And this satisfies--

12:16.776 --> 12:18.531
Oh. Ouch, ouch.

12:18.695 --> 12:19.533
You all right?

12:19.695 --> 12:21.200
Could I get a little, uh...

12:21.367 --> 12:26.163
I'm here to talk to you television
about the monetizing of today broadcast.

12:26.338 --> 12:27.451
Was any of that usable?

12:27.625 --> 12:29.291
GE Promo. 129.

12:29.456 --> 12:31.330
It's called,
"racial integration"--

12:31.507 --> 12:32.500
No, that's not right, is it?

12:32.665 --> 12:35.830
It's called,
"product intergort"--
"intergortian"?

12:36.015 --> 12:38.550
...the way we monetize broadcast television.

12:38.718 --> 12:40.382
How does it work?

12:40.558 --> 12:42.263
Oh!

12:42.427 --> 12:45.802
Could we turn off
the phones, please?

12:45.976 --> 12:48.011
Oh, I'm sorr--ha!
I'm sorry. That's me.

12:48.188 --> 12:49.850
Let me turn this thing off here.

12:50.028 --> 12:52.103
I think I just took a picture.

12:52.276 --> 12:53.982
I'm sorry, everybody,
there's a [bleep] pigeon.

12:54.147 --> 12:56.443
Shoo!

12:56.695 --> 12:59.862
...purchases,
and is satisfied with--Oh.

13:00.038 --> 13:00.903
142.

13:01.077 --> 13:04.320
...in upward revenue
stream dynamics.

13:04.496 --> 13:05.781
For all of us.

13:05.956 --> 13:07.663
Cut.
That's a wrap.

13:07.828 --> 13:10.082
Ha! That was fun,
you guys.

13:10.248 --> 13:11.751
Didn't feel like
five days, did it?

13:11.917 --> 13:12.870
No. Nah, that wasn't bad.

13:13.045 --> 13:14.212
Everybody have a good weekend.

13:14.377 --> 13:18.001
And... we'll be right back.

13:18.757 --> 13:20.052
/Jenna to the stage, please.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.512
Jenna to the stage
for Muffin Top.

13:22.676 --> 13:23.763
Hey, Liz?

13:23.926 --> 13:24.880
Liz...

13:25.057 --> 13:27.513
I'm a little bit nervous
about this rehearsal.

13:27.687 --> 13:28.932
Oh, I'm glad
you brought that up.

13:29.108 --> 13:30.223
You know, you don't have to do this.

13:30.395 --> 13:31.390
I know how busy you are.

13:31.565 --> 13:32.851
Oh, no, I have to do it.

13:33.027 --> 13:35.522
It's a new challenge,
and I like challenges.

13:35.697 --> 13:37.021
I've summited Kilimanjaro.

13:37.198 --> 13:38.903
I've showered
with Greta Van Susteren.

13:39.068 --> 13:41.113
I--I'm gonna do this, yeah.

13:41.288 --> 13:42.231
The time, sir.

13:42.407 --> 13:43.403
Oh, that's right.
Do you mind?

13:43.575 --> 13:44.702
We'll do it around the corner, okay?

13:44.867 --> 13:45.951
I'll be with you in a minute.

13:46.117 --> 13:48.161
I have a conference
with my corporate division head.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.951
Oh, yeah?
Are you guys gonna...

13:50.126 --> 13:54.963
...correlate overseas
earnings report dynamics?

13:55.626 --> 13:57.883
Yes.

14:00.386 --> 14:02.093
Liz?

14:02.258 --> 14:03.092
Did I just hear Jack?

14:03.268 --> 14:04.422
Oh, no, no, no.
Please.

14:04.596 --> 14:07.090
I know for a fact he is talking
to his boss right now.

14:07.268 --> 14:07.930
Really?

14:08.096 --> 14:09.803
Don't bother him.

14:09.978 --> 14:11.430
Fine.

14:11.608 --> 14:13.971
Don't.

14:17.985 --> 14:18.273
Of course, sir.

14:18.446 --> 14:19.310
I'll look into it
right away.

14:19.486 --> 14:22.273
Actions speak louder than words.
Take care of it.

14:22.448 --> 14:24.480
Don't worry, I'll have it on your desk
first thing in the morning.

14:24.655 --> 14:27.283
Look, I am tired of your promises!
I want this thing fixed.

14:27.455 --> 14:30.702
I'm-- I'm on it, sir.

14:37.585 --> 14:38.830
So...

14:39.007 --> 14:40.462
You're Jack's boss, huh?

14:40.637 --> 14:44.510
Oh, well, yeah,
that's what they tell me.

14:44.677 --> 14:46.260
I'm Jenna, by the way.

14:46.425 --> 14:50.182
Oh, I, uh,
I know who you are.

14:50.347 --> 14:51.260
I'm Ron.

14:51.435 --> 14:53.892
Oh, Ron.

14:54.646 --> 14:56.520
How do you take
your coffee, Ron?

14:56.685 --> 14:57.351
I take it? Uh...

14:57.525 --> 15:01.692
I--I take it, uh,
with the non-dairy creamer.

15:01.867 --> 15:05.610
Mmm. Yeah.
Non-dairy creamer.

15:07.785 --> 15:10.030
Yum.

15:18.218 --> 15:18.870
Ahem.

15:19.045 --> 15:21.332
Ahem.

15:21.798 --> 15:22.580
Mmm.

15:22.755 --> 15:23.292
Ahh.

15:23.465 --> 15:24.672
Oh, yeah.

15:24.845 --> 15:25.500
Eh-heh. Wow.

15:25.677 --> 15:26.340
Quiet, please!

15:26.516 --> 15:27.553
Rehearsing!

15:27.718 --> 15:29.513
From Mr. Donaghy's entrance.

15:29.688 --> 15:31.762
What's up, Mr. Donaghy?

15:31.935 --> 15:34.643
That's Josh's line.
Your lines are in blue.

15:34.816 --> 15:35.931
My bad.
I'm sorry.

15:36.107 --> 15:38.390
Those cards are
a little confusing.

15:38.566 --> 15:40.103
Hello, everyone.

15:40.276 --> 15:43.483
Thanks for waiting,
please. Sit...down.

15:43.655 --> 15:45.442
Okay, that's great.
Just one thing, sir.

15:45.617 --> 15:47.320
You're looking into the camera
a little bit.

15:47.487 --> 15:48.821
No, I'm not.

15:48.997 --> 15:51.823
I want to,
but I'm not. No.

15:51.998 --> 15:54.741
Could I get
two coffee cups?

15:54.916 --> 15:56.292
Yeah, you know,
let's take five minutes,

15:56.458 --> 15:59.710
actually, uh, everybody,
while we get Mr. Donaghy some coffee cups.

15:59.878 --> 16:02.331
I know you want to do this,
but I don't think it's working out.

16:02.505 --> 16:04.002
I agree. It's the writing.
It's not natural.

16:04.178 --> 16:05.420
Uhh! Really?

16:05.597 --> 16:06.590
You think the problem is the writing?

16:06.758 --> 16:07.673
Yeah. It's clunky.

16:07.848 --> 16:11.631
Wow. Well, I was really trying to help you out of this,
but, you know what? You're the boss.

16:11.807 --> 16:13.011
I think I can do it.

16:13.187 --> 16:14.471
No. You should definitely do it.

16:14.645 --> 16:15.603
It'll be hilarious.

16:15.768 --> 16:19.270
Oh, well, that'd be a refreshing change
of pace for the show, wouldn't it?

16:19.436 --> 16:22.021
Excuse me.

16:28.287 --> 16:30.192
Why  would Tracy
pretend to be illiterate?

16:30.366 --> 16:31.403
To get out of coming to work.

16:31.578 --> 16:34.030
Oh, so first you thought he was illiterate,
and now you think he's lazy?

16:34.206 --> 16:36.780
Jeez, you are racist.

16:36.958 --> 16:41.542
No. Tracy took advantage of my white guilt,
which is to be used only for good,

16:41.715 --> 16:46.463
like over-tipping
and supporting Barack Obama.

16:48.428 --> 16:50.590
Summon.

16:50.766 --> 16:51.550
Hey, Tray.

16:51.725 --> 16:53.681
Kenneth told me
you finally got in to work.

16:53.845 --> 16:55.513
Yeah, I had to go to reading class.

16:55.686 --> 16:58.722
You hear this mess
about sometimes Y being a vowel?

16:58.897 --> 16:59.931
What a world.

17:00.105 --> 17:00.311
Ah...

17:00.478 --> 17:03.603
Well, we just wanted to show you
the new posters for the show.

17:03.778 --> 17:07.113
Yeah, all right. Cool.

17:11.325 --> 17:15.320
So it's okay to hang these
all over the city?

17:15.497 --> 17:17.623
Yeah.
It's good.

17:17.786 --> 17:19.542
I like it.

17:19.707 --> 17:21.201
Really?

17:21.377 --> 17:23.790
Really.

17:26.047 --> 17:29.712
I'll be leaving early today.

17:31.638 --> 17:37.643
/Jenna and Ghostface Killah,
/to the stage, please, for Muffin Top.

17:45.145 --> 17:47.523
Hello?

17:48.487 --> 17:50.400
Jack?
It's 3:00 in the morning.

17:50.576 --> 17:53.363
What's wrong?

18:01.457 --> 18:06.502
That's quite a commitment
to such terrible writing.

18:07.338 --> 18:09.840
Lemon, I don't know
how to do this.

18:10.007 --> 18:12.421
I know.

18:14.848 --> 18:17.180
I don't get it.
It's not the fear.

18:17.347 --> 18:18.800
I thrive on fear.

18:18.975 --> 18:21.513
You're looking out a fake window
right now, by the way.

18:21.688 --> 18:23.393
I bow-hunt polar bear.

18:23.568 --> 18:26.232
I once drove a rental car into the Hudson
just to practice escaping.

18:26.398 --> 18:27.770
And it's not the public speaking.

18:27.946 --> 18:32.401
There's just something about performing
that I can't wrap my brain around.

18:32.576 --> 18:34.532
All this creative crap.

18:34.695 --> 18:35.530
Acting!

18:35.695 --> 18:37.150
oh...

18:37.326 --> 18:40.162
I've never been able to do it.

18:40.326 --> 18:41.203
Never.

18:41.376 --> 18:44.620
Grains and cereals
are an important--

18:44.795 --> 18:45.622
Oh!

18:45.795 --> 18:46.412
Line!

18:46.588 --> 18:50.002
Damn it!
Son of a bitch!

18:50.175 --> 18:51.423
Lemon.

18:51.596 --> 18:53.461
I need your help.

18:53.638 --> 18:55.960
Really...
Jack Donaghy needs my--

18:56.137 --> 18:56.923
Don't gloat.

18:57.098 --> 18:59.431
It makes you seem mannish.

18:59.597 --> 19:00.183
Okay.

19:00.348 --> 19:02.142
Look, this is not your fault.

19:02.306 --> 19:03.352
This whole thing was a bad idea.

19:03.518 --> 19:06.060
We should just have Josh do it,
and we'll just tell everyone
you're on a business trip.

19:06.238 --> 19:07.351
That's not an option.
I have to do it.

19:07.528 --> 19:09.102
Once I set my mind to something,
I have to accomplish it.

19:09.278 --> 19:11.613
Ten years ago, I was an inch-and-a-half
shorter than I am today.

19:11.775 --> 19:12.860
Sheer willpower.

19:13.027 --> 19:17.151
If I don't figure this thing out by Friday,
then failure wins, and that's not acceptable.

19:17.327 --> 19:18.823
Oh, God, the room is spinning.

19:18.998 --> 19:20.360
What do you want from me?

19:20.536 --> 19:22.661
I'm one of your actors.
I'm freaking out.

19:22.826 --> 19:24.493
Talk me down.

19:24.666 --> 19:27.002
Okay, here's your pep talk.

19:27.168 --> 19:29.332
You're not an actor.
You're Jack Donaghy, all right?

19:29.505 --> 19:31.583
So quit whining and nut up.

19:31.755 --> 19:33.753
You're right,
if you can't do this,
you are a failure.

19:33.926 --> 19:36.672
Josh can do this, and earlier today,
he ate a club sandwich

19:36.846 --> 19:38.341
with the toothpicks still in it.

19:38.515 --> 19:42.473
Jenna can do this,
and she was once engaged to David Blaine.

19:42.647 --> 19:48.062
Any dumb-dumb can act, Jack,
so be a man and get it done.

19:54.235 --> 20:00.453
If you were any other woman on earth...
I would be turned on right now.

20:00.617 --> 20:01.860
Go home.

20:02.035 --> 20:04.951
Get some sleep.

20:08.375 --> 20:12.543
This stays between us,
right, Lemon?

20:13.005 --> 20:15.382
Lemon?

20:17.005 --> 20:19.382
Lemon?

20:22.598 --> 20:24.972
Lemon?

20:30.608 --> 20:33.400
Well, I don't think I have to worry
about my job anymore.

20:33.568 --> 20:34.983
And I didn't bother Jack at all.

20:35.158 --> 20:36.062
Oh, good for you.

20:36.237 --> 20:37.693
That's right.
I took your advice.

20:37.866 --> 20:41.403
I hooked up with his boss.

20:42.288 --> 20:43.862
- Who, Ron?
- Mm-hmm.

20:44.035 --> 20:46.832
That guy's an extra on the show.

20:46.995 --> 20:48.992
No. He said he was Jack's boss.

20:49.166 --> 20:52.921
No. In the sketch.
He doesn't even have a line.

20:53.086 --> 20:55.212
He doesn't have lines?

20:55.388 --> 20:56.541
Don't eat in costume!

20:56.718 --> 21:00.343
Give me a break. I'm just--

21:01.425 --> 21:03.933
But he was yelling at Jack.

21:04.097 --> 21:07.010
Actions speak louder than words.
Take care of it.

21:07.188 --> 21:09.103
Don't worry, sir,
I'll have it on your desk
first thing in the morning.

21:09.267 --> 21:12.851
I am tired of your promises.
I just want this thing fixed now!

21:13.028 --> 21:15.941
I'm on it, sir.

21:16.698 --> 21:21.991
What is the point of belonging to the Extras Guild
if I cannot get health coverage for my foot, hmm?

21:22.155 --> 21:23.150
Ew.

21:23.328 --> 21:24.912
Oh, God, Jenna.

21:25.078 --> 21:27.070
I told you,
don't listen to rumors.

21:27.247 --> 21:28.582
But Frank and Toofer said to me--

21:28.746 --> 21:31.372
Frank and Toofer?
That's where you're getting your information?

21:31.545 --> 21:32.872
They're messing with you!

21:33.046 --> 21:34.540
No. They wouldn't do that to me.

21:34.718 --> 21:35.711
Yeah, they would.

21:35.878 --> 21:38.041
Oh!

21:38.297 --> 21:43.300
I am gonna get back at them...
using my sexuality.

21:46.015 --> 21:48.350
Do you have any left?

21:48.517 --> 21:55.142
/Jenna, Ghostface Killah, and Yo-Yo Ma
/to the stage, please, for Muffin Top.

21:59.655 --> 22:01.692
- Where the hot lesbians at, Lemon?
- I knew it!

22:01.867 --> 22:03.111
You can read!

22:03.288 --> 22:03.651
Fine.

22:03.825 --> 22:05.072
Yes, I'm literate!

22:05.246 --> 22:08.071
I even have a column
in Ebony called Musings!

22:08.246 --> 22:09.622
You are unbelievable.

22:09.788 --> 22:10.781
I'm unbelievable?

22:10.956 --> 22:14.000
What about your racist mess?
Thinking a grown man is illiterate.

22:14.168 --> 22:17.582
That's the subtle racism
of lowered expectations.

22:17.756 --> 22:18.923
Bing Crosby said that.

22:19.087 --> 22:21.382
No, Bill Cosby said that.

22:21.555 --> 22:22.712
That's racist.

22:22.886 --> 22:27.182
Look, we can all agree
Liz is generally pretty racist.

22:27.346 --> 22:30.263
The point is, you have people
counting on you.

22:30.435 --> 22:32.511
You can't be finding excuses
not to be here.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.983
But this job is hard!

22:35.146 --> 22:37.521
I just want to be able
to do what I want to do.

22:37.698 --> 22:41.023
You know, I once shot a whole movie
without ever getting out of my car?

22:41.197 --> 22:44.482
Yeah, I paid to see that.
That was supposed to be a western.

22:44.656 --> 22:46.782
You're not a big shot
movie star anymore, Tray.

22:46.957 --> 22:50.531
You're the star of TGS,
and you will read the lines as written,

22:50.707 --> 22:53.410
starting tonight
because this show is important.

22:53.586 --> 22:55.081
I set a very high standard
for myself,

22:55.255 --> 22:58.121
and I expect the same
of the professionals who work with me.

22:58.295 --> 23:00.422
When Gaybraham Lincoln gets hit in the crotch,
can I go cross-eyed?

23:00.587 --> 23:04.671
Oh, yes, do that.
That's hilarious!

23:09.386 --> 23:12.223
Hey have you seen
Frank or Toofer?

23:12.396 --> 23:14.311
Pete!

23:14.476 --> 23:17.810
The standards lady is saying
that my moaning in Muffin Top is too graphic.

23:17.985 --> 23:19.441
Which of these is less offensive?

23:19.607 --> 23:21.730
Ahh! Ahh!

23:21.906 --> 23:22.863
Ahhh!

23:23.028 --> 23:23.771
Or...

23:23.946 --> 23:25.363
Ooh-hunh!

23:25.538 --> 23:26.823
Unh-hunh!

23:26.998 --> 23:28.112
Ohhh!

23:28.287 --> 23:29.663
Both sound good to me.

23:29.827 --> 23:32.491
Hello, Ron.

23:34.127 --> 23:37.291
I would just hate
for Muffin Top to get cut
because of a standards problem.

23:37.456 --> 23:39.333
I've already posted it
on my weblog though
I'll be doing it.

23:39.506 --> 23:40.461
Jenna, we're not gonna cut it.

23:40.627 --> 23:41.333
Are you messing with me?

23:41.507 --> 23:43.091
Because people around here
keep messing with me.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.712
I'm not messing with you.

23:44.886 --> 23:47.171
So which one? Ahh!

23:47.347 --> 23:48.421
Or, ohhh!

23:48.597 --> 23:52.643
Uh, I guess...
Uh, "ahh ahh! Ahh."

23:55.437 --> 23:57.563
Oh, Hey. Look,
it's no big deal,

23:57.727 --> 23:59.603
but we had to make some changes
in your sketch, okay?

23:59.775 --> 24:01.143
I have new pages for you.

24:01.318 --> 24:01.691
You do?

24:01.858 --> 24:04.361
Yeah. Tracy is now in it now,
so we had to change some of the cues.

24:04.525 --> 24:07.822
Also, the opening VT is cut,
so you just go right out, okay?

24:07.998 --> 24:10.242
Oh, and, um, you all say
the last line together.

24:10.407 --> 24:11.453
Wow. So, uh...

24:11.617 --> 24:14.783
So you're gonna be great.
Have fun.

24:14.957 --> 24:17.951
Lemon, these pages are blank.

24:18.125 --> 24:19.043
Oh.

24:19.206 --> 24:20.002
Never mind.

24:20.168 --> 24:21.290
Withdrawn.

24:21.468 --> 24:25.961
And, remember,
don't look into the camera!

24:29.975 --> 24:30.551
Toofer?

24:30.726 --> 24:31.180
Yeah?

24:31.348 --> 24:32.262
Can I tell you a secret?

24:32.436 --> 24:32.972
Sure.

24:33.148 --> 24:36.720
We've been working together a while,
and I know this may sound crazy,

24:36.896 --> 24:39.022
but I've been watching you.

24:39.186 --> 24:44.862
I have this fantasy of sneaking up to the roof of 30 Rock,
and we make love while looking out at the city --

24:45.028 --> 24:46.192
Okay, let me guess.

24:46.368 --> 24:52.990
You figured out Frank and I lied to you, so to get even,
you're trying to get me naked on the roof and leave me there.

24:53.166 --> 24:55.702
Nice try.

24:56.786 --> 24:59.622
Where's Frank?

25:00.588 --> 25:02.082
But we're cool,
right, Mr. Donaghy?

25:02.257 --> 25:05.502
No, you're all fired.

25:11.887 --> 25:15.140
No, you're all fired.

25:18.396 --> 25:20.183
Hey, good job the other night.

25:20.357 --> 25:22.522
Oh, you mean on the show?
Thanks.

25:22.685 --> 25:24.230
What were you watching?

25:24.395 --> 25:26.273
Nothing. Uh...

25:26.445 --> 25:27.693
Bloomberg.

25:27.866 --> 25:30.112
Hmm.

25:31.788 --> 25:32.902
Aha!

25:33.075 --> 25:37.822
Don't be cute, Lemon.
You're too old for that.

25:40.497 --> 25:43.041
Good God!

25:43.836 --> 25:45.000
Lemon!

25:45.176 --> 25:48.042
Mr. Donaghy, open up!
Please?

25:48.217 --> 25:50.591
Lemon!

25:50.758 --> 25:52.170
* Everyone knows

25:52.345 --> 25:54.550
* The most delicious part of the muffin *

25:54.727 --> 25:56.933
* Is the top

25:57.095 --> 25:58.140
* My muffin top

25:58.307 --> 26:00.890
* Is all that whole grain, low-fat *

26:01.068 --> 26:02.682
* I know you want a piece of that *

26:02.856 --> 26:04.392
* But I just wanna dance *

26:04.566 --> 26:06.312
* Ch-checkin' out my sweet hips *

26:06.487 --> 26:08.151
* My sugar-coated berry lips *

26:08.318 --> 26:10.111
* I know you want to get with this *

26:10.275 --> 26:11.941
* But I'm just here to dance *

26:12.116 --> 26:13.533
* So back

26:13.697 --> 26:15.453
* Up off of me

26:15.617 --> 26:17.411
* You're we-ee-ee-eirding

26:17.577 --> 26:19.071
* Me out

26:19.245 --> 26:21.031
* I'm an independent lady

26:21.206 --> 26:23.002
* So do not try to play me *

26:23.168 --> 26:24.792
* I run a tidy bakery

26:24.966 --> 26:26.670
* The boys all want my cake for free *

26:26.836 --> 26:28.540
Does she know we went off
the air two minutes ago?

26:28.717 --> 26:32.672
- No, she does not.
- Smart move.
