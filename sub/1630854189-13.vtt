down the drain.

00:33.609 --> 00:35.034
I just really want
to thank you guys.

00:35.261 --> 00:36.684
You know, it's...

Come on, man.

00:39.689 --> 00:40.688
It's ice-cream cake.

00:43.527 --> 00:44.434
Yay!

00:44.528 --> 00:45.878
(cheering)

00:46.105 --> 00:49.122
All right,
let the spanking begin.

Wait, wait, wait.
Not so fast.

-Ooh!
-(screaming)

00:54.555 --> 00:56.472
Demon cake!

00:57.633 --> 01:00.875
Yeah. Probably should've
seen that coming.

01:00.895 --> 01:02.061
What are you doing?

01:02.212 --> 01:04.480
Uh, tying my shoe.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.232
Max, I'm really sorry.

01:07.459 --> 01:09.234
Ah, it's all right,
I don't need any cake

01:09.461 --> 01:11.978
as long as I've got
good friends, my health,

01:12.055 --> 01:13.130
and presents.

01:13.148 --> 01:14.389
Presents, presents, presents!

01:14.483 --> 01:16.891
Uh, well, this year I had

01:16.969 --> 01:18.226
everyone chip in--

01:18.395 --> 01:19.803
So I'm only getting one present?

01:19.822 --> 01:22.322
Yeah, but you're getting
one really awesome present,

01:22.474 --> 01:23.974
one that you'll never forget.

01:24.143 --> 01:25.492
Oh, great,

01:25.644 --> 01:27.477
like the time you took me
on a "behind-the-scenes tour"

01:27.496 --> 01:30.071
of the aquarium and
gave me a quiz afterward?

You're the best!

01:39.992 --> 01:42.417
Oh, uh, we didn't get you a car,
we rented you an RV

01:42.469 --> 01:44.252
so we can take a tour
of the Smoky Mountains

We getting married.

that I'm not allowed to touch.

02:29.633 --> 02:31.132

02:39.735 --> 02:42.903
The one with the basketball
hoop and the<i> Star Wars</i> poster?

02:42.997 --> 02:44.663
No, our place.

02:44.740 --> 02:46.406
And that's a limited
edition print

02:46.558 --> 02:48.392
signed by the little guy
inside the robot.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.403
Yeah, but this is
a great neighborhood,

02:59.421 --> 03:00.904
and it's right near
my son's school.

03:00.923 --> 03:02.997
Well, we can find another
place in this area.

03:03.017 --> 03:04.332
I like this place.

03:04.459 --> 03:06.092
I spilled syrup
down the floor vent

03:06.169 --> 03:09.413
so when the heat comes on,
it smells delicious.

03:09.506 --> 03:12.173
Come on, we're supposed to be
starting our lives together.

03:12.267 --> 03:14.193
Look at that
little bitty kitchen.

03:14.344 --> 03:15.194
We need a kitchen big enough

03:15.362 --> 03:17.011

03:17.031 --> 03:18.346
Do not insult my ass.

You can bounce a damn quarter
off this thing.

03:20.684 --> 03:22.592

03:22.686 --> 03:23.944
No, we can't,

03:24.096 --> 03:25.612
because we have
to save our quarters

03:25.764 --> 03:27.113
for the Laundromat
because this stupid place

03:27.266 --> 03:28.523
doesn't have a washing machine.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.209
Oh, if you calling
this condo stupid,

a shower, and an Xbox?

04:16.331 --> 04:17.739
(laughs) Well, I'm ready.

04:17.833 --> 04:20.484
I was up all night making
homemade mosquito repellant.

04:20.577 --> 04:21.485
Really? That's a thing?

04:21.578 --> 04:23.595
Oh, yeah.
Lemongrass, citronella,

04:23.764 --> 04:25.747
and just a kiss of urine.

04:26.525 --> 04:28.992
There was a cute little
red-headed baby there

04:29.085 --> 04:30.727

04:44.026 --> 04:45.525

wanted to come...

04:45.619 --> 04:47.369
on a couples' trip...

04:48.271 --> 04:50.497
in an RV that only has two beds.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.625

Yeah, sure, why not?

05:04.363 --> 05:06.621
But you owe me a present.
No donation in my name,

05:06.715 --> 05:10.200
no star named after me,
no tree planted in my honor.

05:10.293 --> 05:12.702
I want a cool toy
that I can play with.

05:12.721 --> 05:13.887
You know what, Gideon?

05:13.963 --> 05:15.147
Since you're bringing
your harmonica,

05:15.298 --> 05:16.723
I'm gonna bring my castanets.

05:16.875 --> 05:19.651
I mean, I don't want to
oversell it, but check this out.

05:24.232 --> 05:27.451
It sounds a lot better
with the actual castanets.

05:29.054 --> 05:32.205
She knows she smells
like pee, right?

05:33.909 --> 05:36.126
(playing sad melody)

05:44.178 --> 05:48.513
All right, that was "From Depths
of Woe I Cry to Thee."

05:48.740 --> 05:50.682
Anybody else have a favorite
hymn they'd like to hear?

05:50.834 --> 05:52.517
How about "On the Road Again"?

05:52.669 --> 05:55.520
Don't know that one, but here's
a little ditty called

05:55.672 --> 05:58.264
"There Is a Fountain
Filled With Blood."

05:58.417 --> 06:00.192
Carter, if you ever want
to see me naked again,

06:00.343 --> 06:01.918

that harmonica from him.

06:02.011 --> 06:04.921
Sorry, man.
I'm not anti-harmonica,

06:04.940 --> 06:06.698
but I am pro-nudity.

06:07.684 --> 06:10.351
I just flossed my teeth
at 70 miles per hour,

06:13.040 --> 06:14.188
Oh, Gideon, no more harmonica?

06:14.208 --> 06:16.950

Birthday Weekend

asterisk: A Smoke-Free Weekend"?

06:32.041 --> 06:33.058
Yeah.

06:33.209 --> 06:34.559
There's a lot of stuff in here

06:34.711 --> 06:36.043
about things that will kill us:

06:36.063 --> 06:37.879
like bears, killer bees,

06:37.973 --> 06:39.623
and-and eventually
climate change?

06:39.641 --> 06:41.048
Well, our greatest weapon
is education.

06:41.143 --> 06:43.126
Except against killer bees.

06:43.219 --> 06:45.629
Because, ironically,
that one's climate change.

06:45.722 --> 06:49.966
Okay, "Step one, identify
if a bear is a black bear

06:49.985 --> 06:51.134
"or a brown bear.

06:51.227 --> 06:54.079
Step one-A,
black bears can also be brown."

06:54.306 --> 06:56.731
Why does everything
got to be about color?

06:56.825 --> 06:58.750
Here's the thing. If you're
attacked by a brown bear,

06:58.977 --> 06:59.976
play dead.

06:59.995 --> 07:01.420
If you're attacked
by a black bear,

07:01.571 --> 07:03.146
don't play dead.

07:03.165 --> 07:05.740
But black bears can be brown,
brown bears cannot be black,

07:05.834 --> 07:08.334
and if we see a polar bear,
we're on a magical island

07:08.487 --> 07:10.820
where nothing
will ever make sense.

07:10.839 --> 07:14.491
We can also fight back with
the most powerful weapon of all.

07:14.509 --> 07:15.583
Prayer.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.494
Or a razor-sharp katana.

07:17.587 --> 07:20.163
Oh, wait. Someone told me
not to bring that.

07:20.256 --> 07:22.441
You know what someone
should've told you not to bring?

07:22.668 --> 07:24.501
Your dumb ass.

07:24.519 --> 07:26.169
-Oh. Here.
-Oh.

07:26.188 --> 07:27.446
Oh, you're gonna regret that.

07:27.522 --> 07:29.448
Uh, is everything okay

08:38.243 --> 08:39.500
Go talk to her.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.002
But take the olives
off your fingers first.

08:41.096 --> 08:43.063
Aw. Okay.

08:44.507 --> 08:46.933
I'll go see if she needs help
washing dishes.

That boy need practice
talking to women.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.607
Hey, maybe we should
take him to a strip club.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.018
Oh, well, why don't you just
take him to your bathroom?

08:57.112 --> 08:58.203
It looks like a strip club.

08:58.354 --> 09:00.764

those tacky gold faucets.

09:00.857 --> 09:02.207
Oh! So gold is tacky?

the Olympics and tell them

09:04.102 --> 09:05.359

No, I'm gonna call my cousin

09:06.713 --> 09:07.604

Oh!

09:12.886 --> 09:14.611
(laughter)

09:15.297 --> 09:17.614
You know, I think they
staged that fight

09:17.707 --> 09:19.132
because they don't want
to pay for lunch.

09:19.301 --> 09:21.042
Yeah, I think you're
probably right.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.302
But it is my birthday, so...

09:22.396 --> 09:24.470
Okay, all right, I got you.

09:24.547 --> 09:25.880
And, uh, I hope you
saved some room.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.381
There's a really
cool place up ahead

09:27.401 --> 09:29.734

in the shape of presidents.

on our burgers
tonight and, uh...

09:42.565 --> 09:44.140
I don't want to brag,
but this is how

09:44.142 --> 09:47.234
I've managed to not buy a bottle
of ketchup in six years.

09:47.329 --> 09:49.145
Uh, first of all, weird flex.

09:49.238 --> 09:51.572
Uh, and I have had the same
bottle of ketchup for six years.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.407
You know, you've actually
saved like $1.40.

10:23.181 --> 10:24.289

16:51.402 --> 16:52.510

To my fantastic home.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.423
No one is going home!

16:57.517 --> 16:59.909
Okay? We're gonna see
a gorgeous fricking lake

in 4.81 miles.

17:01.670 --> 17:03.521

17:30.775 --> 17:32.458
Okay, that's a black bear.

17:32.610 --> 17:34.610

it's either a black bear...

17:34.612 --> 17:36.112
or not a black bear.

17:36.130 --> 17:38.631

yourself as big as possible

and then slowly back away.

17:40.301 --> 17:41.617
Oh, you read my binder?

17:41.710 --> 17:43.619
There was a lot of good
pictures of me in there.

17:43.638 --> 17:44.620
Did the binder say anything

17:44.713 --> 17:45.955
about marking your territory

18:31.336 --> 18:33.002
when I was protecting you
from that bear.

18:33.095 --> 18:34.428
You were standing behind me.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.470
Wha...?

18:35.523 --> 18:37.173
I didn't want it
to sneak up on you.

It's called having
your back, Randi.

18:39.360 --> 18:40.601
I don't want to fight anymore.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.194
We went camping with
a bunch of white people

18:42.347 --> 18:44.847
and almost got killed.
That's on us.

18:44.940 --> 18:47.366
Look, I get you don't want
to move into my condo

18:47.518 --> 18:49.034
because I lived there
with my ex-wife.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.611
You did? I didn't know that!

18:50.630 --> 18:54.540
Well, then I didn't,
and you still don't know that.

18:55.376 --> 18:57.710
Well, I was thinking maybe
we can change a few things

18:57.862 --> 19:01.197
about your place to make it
feel more like our place.

19:01.199 --> 19:03.382
Really? Thank you, baby.

19:03.551 --> 19:05.309
But now that I know that
Stephanie lived there with you,

19:05.461 --> 19:08.813
we are ripping that sucker
down to the studs.

19:08.964 --> 19:10.481
We could do that.

19:10.708 --> 19:14.727
You know, uh, Stephanie was
there when I bought my old Xbox.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.988
So, we gonna need
to get the new one.

19:17.139 --> 19:18.406
(Randi chuckles)

19:19.567 --> 19:22.551
Sorry your birthday
was kind of a bust.

19:22.553 --> 19:25.221
Are you kidding?
I punched out a bear.

19:26.148 --> 19:27.498
And you're gonna back me up
when I tell people that,

19:27.725 --> 19:30.084
-that's your birthday gift
to me.
-(sighs)

19:32.397 --> 19:35.231
I have never been so terrified.

19:35.249 --> 19:36.248
Yeah.

19:36.401 --> 19:39.177
I'm really glad
you were there with me.

19:39.328 --> 19:40.736
Yeah, the whole thing just made

19:40.755 --> 19:43.181
what we were fighting
about seem so stupid.

19:43.408 --> 19:46.333
I shouldn't have
called you a child.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.686
I shouldn't have called you
a control freak.

19:48.913 --> 19:50.688
You didn't.

19:50.839 --> 19:52.765
Right, that was with Carter.

19:53.584 --> 19:57.420
So even though I'm a bit
of a micromanager...

19:57.438 --> 20:00.439
you still want
to move in together?

20:00.591 --> 20:02.283
<i> Sí, señor.</i>

20:03.369 --> 20:04.685
Yeah, and if you think
it's too quick,

20:04.704 --> 20:05.644
I can totally find

20:05.705 --> 20:08.206
(whispering):
another roommate.

20:08.357 --> 20:10.708
I said that low
in case Gideon's around.

20:11.619 --> 20:13.285
If the two of us
can get through that,

20:13.438 --> 20:15.028
we can get through anything.

20:15.122 --> 20:17.048
Except climate change,
that's really gonna require

20:17.199 --> 20:19.425
more of a group effort.

20:20.202 --> 20:21.944
-Max.
-(chuckling)

20:29.229 --> 20:31.211

Hey, is that Gideon driving?

20:31.231 --> 20:32.879
Does Gideon know how to drive?

20:32.899 --> 20:34.565
I'm sure he does.

20:35.309 --> 20:36.976
I'm gonna ask the waitress
out on a date!

20:37.070 --> 20:38.277
Life is too short!

20:38.404 --> 20:40.053
No, stop the RV!

20:40.073 --> 20:42.573
