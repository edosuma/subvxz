WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.636
Last Time on
Make It Pop.

00:02.670 --> 00:04.105
Jodi: Jared recasted
the whole play?

00:04.138 --> 00:05.673
The cowardly lion
has all the lines?

00:05.706 --> 00:08.276
Jared: Now, we finally have
the show we're looking for.

00:08.309 --> 00:09.543
Jodi: If we don't put
on a great show,

00:09.577 --> 00:11.079
Mrs.Diona will close
down the theater department.

00:11.112 --> 00:11.779
No performing arts?

00:11.812 --> 00:13.081
I'm taking
back the play!

00:13.114 --> 00:14.082
It's just
like, Macbeth!

00:14.115 --> 00:15.816
Wait, don't
say that!

00:15.849 --> 00:18.952
I need you to
leave the theater.

00:18.986 --> 00:20.988
This is not a
theater, it's a gym.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.390
It's a gymna-torium,
it still counts.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.992
I need you to go outside,
turn around three times,

00:25.025 --> 00:26.994
spit and then ask
to come back in.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.062
That's going to work?

00:28.096 --> 00:29.263
Yes.

00:29.297 --> 00:29.963
Now leave!

00:29.997 --> 00:35.836
Taa-taa-taa-
taa-ta-ta-ta.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.005
Spin.

00:38.038 --> 00:38.772
Spit.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.040
Ask.

00:40.074 --> 00:45.813
And do it right or I'll have to
get eye of newt and toe of frog.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.047
Corki: Hey Sun
Hi, what's up?

00:47.081 --> 00:50.884
The Sun Hi Nation and I are
undoing a teensy curse from--

00:50.918 --> 00:51.885
Macbeth!

00:51.919 --> 00:54.322
Argh!

00:54.355 --> 00:56.757
One, two three.

00:56.790 --> 00:57.391
Whoooh!

00:57.425 --> 00:58.526
Sorry.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.994
Now I'm not sure where to spit,
but probably not on you.

01:01.028 --> 01:05.899
Spit!!!

01:05.933 --> 01:08.202
May I enter, may I
enter, may I enter?

01:08.236 --> 01:10.971
You may.

01:11.004 --> 01:12.773
Bye.

01:12.806 --> 01:13.974
Jared: Mind if I join?

01:14.007 --> 01:15.776
Depends, are you
going to be weird?

01:15.809 --> 01:17.178
No, I'm back
to my former,

01:17.211 --> 01:18.546
nearly impossible
to improve self.

01:18.579 --> 01:21.549
Sorry I put a bit of
pressure on you with the play.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.151
Mr. Stark's taken
it back now.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.153
Well, I know you
had a grand vision.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.320
Indeed.

01:26.354 --> 01:29.157
But still, it was no
excuse to go power-mad.

01:29.190 --> 01:32.960
Look, the play went sideways,
but we became friends.

01:32.993 --> 01:36.297
Would you consider
rejoining the cast?

01:36.330 --> 01:38.532
That way, we can
spend more time together.

01:38.566 --> 01:40.033
Hmm.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.869
Can't you just say,
Scottish Play?

01:41.902 --> 01:42.736
Is that so hard?

01:42.770 --> 01:44.905
It's just a stuffy
old superstition!

01:44.938 --> 01:47.241
I mean, Shakespeare
lived like forty years ago.

01:47.275 --> 01:51.179
Four hundred, Miss Song,
and that's precisely the point.

01:51.212 --> 01:55.816
The theater is an ancient art
form, steeped in tradition,

01:55.849 --> 01:58.552
majesty, dignity--

01:58.586 --> 02:00.954
I think I'm going to
focus on my studies.

02:00.988 --> 02:03.056
We should put our
feelings on hold.

02:03.090 --> 02:04.325
All right.

02:04.358 --> 02:08.196
You can try to ignore me, but
be prepared to accept failure.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.997
Macbeth.

02:10.030 --> 02:13.201
(grunting)

02:13.234 --> 02:13.801
(crashing)

02:13.834 --> 02:17.538
Jared: Mr. Stark.

02:17.571 --> 02:21.275
(grunting)

02:21.309 --> 02:23.411
Curses aren't
real, right?

02:23.444 --> 02:24.578
No.

02:24.612 --> 02:28.249
But just to be safe I say,
that for the next few days

02:28.282 --> 02:31.352
we avoid ladders and black
cats and angry genies.

02:31.385 --> 02:32.186
Ooh!

02:32.220 --> 02:35.055
(bang)

02:35.088 --> 02:35.923
Oops.

02:35.956 --> 02:36.990
You guys!

02:37.024 --> 02:38.526
You're being
so immature!

02:38.559 --> 02:40.461
We are masters
of our own fate.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.129
(cellphone ringing)

02:42.162 --> 02:43.264
Ou!

02:43.297 --> 02:47.535
Speaking of fate, a TV network
just contacted my vlog.

02:47.568 --> 02:50.871
They're interested
in talking to me.

02:50.904 --> 02:52.640
My time has come!

02:52.673 --> 02:54.542
(cellphone ringing)

02:54.575 --> 02:58.879
Hello, this is Sun
Hi Song speaking.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.981
What?

03:01.014 --> 03:03.517
Mr. Stark,
it's for you.

03:03.551 --> 03:04.452
Take a message.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.387
It's a TV producer.

03:06.420 --> 03:09.156
S'cuse me.

03:09.189 --> 03:09.890
(chuckles)

03:09.923 --> 03:12.960
Unique New York,
unique New York.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.928
Hello, Melwood,
Stark speaking!

03:14.962 --> 03:16.897
Ah, hello.

03:16.930 --> 03:20.033
(chuckling)

03:20.067 --> 03:25.273
They're talking to
him and not me!?

03:25.306 --> 03:30.344
Maybe that Macbeth
curse really is a thing.

03:30.378 --> 03:31.345
Woah!

03:31.379 --> 03:34.382
* Make it pop, woo, woo

03:34.415 --> 03:38.286
* Make it pop, woo, woo

03:38.319 --> 03:41.689
* I can't wait, no
I can't wait, no *

03:41.722 --> 03:44.592
* I can't wait,
no I can't wait *

03:44.625 --> 03:46.193
* So make it pop

03:46.226 --> 03:48.396
* We're bout to,
we're bout to blow *

03:48.429 --> 03:49.997
* Wait till we drop

03:50.030 --> 03:51.999
* Oh ya, we're
ready to go *

03:52.032 --> 03:55.002
* Ain't gonna stop, when
is it time for the show *

03:55.035 --> 03:57.605
* We make it, you make
it, they make it *

03:57.638 --> 04:00.408
* M-m-m-m-m-m-
Make it pop *

04:02.476 --> 04:04.244
Ms. Diona: I'm so
sorry, Mr. Stark.

04:04.278 --> 04:06.647
Now that, your little production
has to carry the weight

04:06.680 --> 04:08.048
of the curse of Mc--

04:08.081 --> 04:09.317
Eekk,
The Scottish play.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.385
The nice thing about
an aquatic center is,

04:11.419 --> 04:13.687
there is no archaic
hocus pocus attached to it.

04:13.721 --> 04:16.624
Just pure athleticism,
lots of funding,

04:16.657 --> 04:19.226
and a dash
of hunky lifeguard.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.028
We're not finished
yet, Ms. Diona.

04:21.061 --> 04:24.498
Indeed, but I am
recommending, next semester,

04:24.532 --> 04:27.501
all staff get certified
as pool cleaners.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.269
(chuckles)

04:29.303 --> 04:33.474
This may be the last theatrical
production at MacKendrick Prep,

04:33.507 --> 04:37.177
in short, I'm
open to ideas.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.479
A whole show in pink!

04:38.512 --> 04:39.212
Uh uh.

04:39.246 --> 04:41.482
A laser light
extravaganza!

04:41.515 --> 04:42.215
No.

04:42.249 --> 04:44.084
A one-man
show starring me!

04:44.117 --> 04:45.453
Absolutely not.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.020
Mr. Stark!

04:47.054 --> 04:49.222
Remember my costumes
and Caleb's music?

04:49.256 --> 04:52.526
I remember my first sound
and costume design job.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.595
It was for a
Japanese Western I wrote

04:54.628 --> 04:57.030
called No Way, Jose.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.098
Mr. Stark?

04:58.131 --> 05:01.569
Don't interrupt me, I am
in the middle of a story.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.571
My audience
is enthralled.

05:03.604 --> 05:05.138
I'm Stefan,
from the network.

05:05.172 --> 05:06.540
We spoke on
the phone earlier?

05:06.574 --> 05:08.241
Of course, of course!

05:08.275 --> 05:09.176
Pleasure to meet you.

05:09.209 --> 05:11.144
I didn't think you'd
actually show up,

05:11.178 --> 05:14.482
you see you're in television
so I assumed you were all talk.

05:14.515 --> 05:15.749
(laughing)

05:15.783 --> 05:19.086
You see, that's exactly kind of
prickly sound byte we're looking

05:19.119 --> 05:23.023
for on Stark
Raving Mad.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.192
What's Stark
Raving Mad?'

05:25.225 --> 05:28.028
It's a brand new reality show
staring your drama teacher!

05:28.061 --> 05:29.162
Isn't that exciting?

05:29.196 --> 05:33.434
I was going to mention it,
but I'm no self promoter.

05:33.467 --> 05:34.668
They're gonna
follow me around

05:34.702 --> 05:36.704
while I heroically
save the play.

05:36.737 --> 05:40.674
Doesn't it need saving because
he heroically abandoned it?

05:40.708 --> 05:42.643
But, but,
but--I,

05:42.676 --> 05:43.911
I, I-- why him?

05:43.944 --> 05:47.280
Well you see we found Mr. Stark
in a series of internet videos

05:47.314 --> 05:49.282
made by a self
aggrandizing vlogger.

05:49.316 --> 05:50.150
That's me!

05:50.183 --> 05:52.219
Self-aggrandizing vlogger!

05:52.252 --> 05:53.421
That's a
good thing, right?

05:53.454 --> 05:53.987
Awkward.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.489
But great television!

05:55.523 --> 05:56.690
So let's shoot.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.191
Shall we?

05:58.225 --> 06:02.295
But, but, but, but.

06:02.329 --> 06:04.331
I don't want to be
a monkey again.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.599
I know.

06:05.633 --> 06:09.336
I just didn't want you to run
away while I talked about us.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.338
Us?

06:11.371 --> 06:14.374
Does this
mean we're a 'we'?

06:14.408 --> 06:16.510
Are you asking me to
be your girlfriend?

06:16.544 --> 06:20.113
If I was, would
you say yes?

06:20.147 --> 06:22.115
I might.

06:22.149 --> 06:22.616
Yes.

06:22.650 --> 06:24.151
Yes, yes!

06:24.184 --> 06:25.719
Ahh!

06:25.753 --> 06:27.855
Shhh,
No one can know!

06:27.888 --> 06:29.122
Why not?

06:29.156 --> 06:30.591
Corki and Jared
have their thing,

06:30.624 --> 06:33.794
and if people find out about
us, Sun Hi will feel left out.

06:33.827 --> 06:36.396
Then we need to find
someone for Sun Hi?

06:36.430 --> 06:38.131
Help me.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.634
It would have to be
someone she likes as much

06:40.668 --> 06:41.635
as she likes
herself.

06:41.669 --> 06:42.636
That'll be a challenge.

06:42.670 --> 06:47.207
I know, right?

06:47.240 --> 06:52.312
(crash)

06:52.345 --> 06:53.413
Could it be--

06:53.447 --> 06:55.115
The curse?

06:55.148 --> 06:57.184
Nah.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.285
Oh, haha.

06:58.318 --> 06:59.286
Uh, uh.

06:59.319 --> 07:01.221
This is the
water fountain,

07:01.254 --> 07:05.392
I generally use it
about twice a day.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.696
More often if I've
had a salty ah lunch.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.698
Sun Hi: Why are they
following Mr. Stark

07:10.731 --> 07:15.435
when there's an obvious reality
star right in this hallway?

07:15.469 --> 07:16.336
Lonnie?

07:16.369 --> 07:18.238
The kid who flips
his eyes inside out?

07:18.271 --> 07:19.873
I guess he's not
without his charm.

07:19.907 --> 07:20.841
No, Jodi!

07:20.874 --> 07:22.075
Me!

07:22.109 --> 07:25.713
I have all the qualities of
a reality star, I'm beautiful,

07:25.746 --> 07:28.549
social media savvy,
and totally self involved.

07:28.582 --> 07:32.319
Besides, I did not practice
smizing in the mirror,

07:32.352 --> 07:36.456
for three hours
a night for nothing!

07:36.490 --> 07:39.627
Smizing, smiling
with the eyes.

07:39.660 --> 07:44.565
Smiling, smizing, smiling,
smizing, smiling, smizing.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.567
Oh, I've bruised my
elbow on that moulding

07:46.600 --> 07:48.168
on more than
one occasion,

07:48.201 --> 07:50.337
it's the dangers
of an artists life.

07:50.370 --> 07:55.375
I just know that I should be
the one in front of that camera.

07:55.408 --> 08:02.683
* I put my hands
up in the air *

08:02.716 --> 08:04.518
* S-U-N Hi

08:04.552 --> 08:08.421

look no further *

08:19.733 --> 08:22.235

chains and leather *

08:22.269 --> 08:24.471
* All the kids wanna roll

08:24.504 --> 08:26.640
* They really wanna

08:26.674 --> 08:29.376
* And they wanna get the diamond
rings and the limousines *

08:29.409 --> 08:31.011
* And be
rolling in green *

08:31.044 --> 08:34.848
* It's time to fly,
so go reach for the sky *

08:34.882 --> 08:38.819
* I put my hands up in the air,
Make everybody stop and stare *

08:38.852 --> 08:43.591

08:43.624 --> 08:47.628
* I put my hands up in the air,
Make everybody stop and stare *

08:47.661 --> 08:51.865
* Write my name across
the sky I'm a superstar *

08:51.899 --> 08:56.503
* I put my hands up
in the air, yeah, yeah *

08:56.536 --> 09:00.808
* Write my name across
the sky I'm a superstar *

09:00.841 --> 09:05.312
* I put my hands up in
the air, yeah yeah *

09:05.345 --> 09:10.517
* Write my name across
the sky I'm a superstar *

09:10.550 --> 09:14.287
* Everyday's like a dream, who
knows just what it will bring *

09:14.321 --> 09:17.290
* We gon' live it up,
up the party *

09:17.324 --> 09:19.026
* Never gonna

09:32.039 --> 09:34.407
* They really wanna
be like you, yeah *

09:34.441 --> 09:37.410
* And they wanna get the diamond
rings and the limousines *

09:37.444 --> 09:39.012
* And be
rolling in green *

09:39.046 --> 09:42.650
* Play lucky seven if you
want a slice of heaven, yeah *

09:42.683 --> 09:46.553
* I put my hands up in the air
Make everybody stop and stare *

09:46.586 --> 09:50.758
* Write my name across
the sky I'm a superstar *

09:50.791 --> 09:55.428
* I put my hands up in the air
Make everybody stop and stare *

09:55.462 --> 09:59.599
* Write my name across
the sky I'm a superstar *

09:59.633 --> 10:04.404
* I put my hands up
in the air, yeah, yeah *

10:04.437 --> 10:09.309
* Write my name across
the sky I'm a superstar *

10:09.342 --> 10:13.346
* I put my hands up
in the air, yeah, yeah *

10:13.380 --> 10:19.853
* Write my name across
the sky I'm a superstar *

10:19.887 --> 10:22.389
And cut.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.457
Guys that was perfect.

10:24.491 --> 10:27.227
Uh, I'm going to be
late for rehearsals.

10:27.260 --> 10:30.030
Sorry Mr. Stark still
won't let you be in the play.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.298
Oh, I'm way
beyond that.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.532
I have bigger
plans now.

10:34.735 --> 10:39.039
These young artists need me to
help them fulfill their dreams.

10:39.072 --> 10:42.242
I'm the dream maker.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.244
Could you take a
look at this music?

10:44.277 --> 10:45.445
And check
out this costume?

10:45.478 --> 10:47.280
Silence, students!

10:47.314 --> 10:50.150
I'm trying to
explain my vision.

10:50.183 --> 10:53.420
Perhaps I can be
of some assistance?

10:53.453 --> 10:56.623
Jared!

10:56.656 --> 10:57.791
Now, where was I?

10:57.825 --> 11:01.261
Oh, yes -- imparting
the gift of drama.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.130
You know, this guy
makes me wish

11:03.163 --> 11:07.534
I didn't drop out of that
car insurance course.

11:07.567 --> 11:12.239
* I put my hands up in the air
Make everybody stop and stare *

11:12.272 --> 11:18.178
* Write my name across the
sky I'm a superstar! *

11:19.412 --> 11:20.480
Ahhhh!

11:20.513 --> 11:21.715
A broken mirror!

11:21.749 --> 11:22.783
More bad luck!

11:22.816 --> 11:24.617
Let's not all blame
Caleb at once.

11:24.651 --> 11:25.652
The curse!

11:25.685 --> 11:26.586
It's real.

11:26.619 --> 11:28.756
What are
we gonna do?!

11:28.789 --> 11:29.823
Yes!

11:29.857 --> 11:31.291
That was fantastic.

11:31.324 --> 11:32.760
More where that
came from, please.

11:32.793 --> 11:35.562
Young lady,
what is your name?

11:35.595 --> 11:37.530
Sun Hi Song.

11:37.564 --> 11:38.265
Ah yes.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.300
The self-aggrandizing
vlogger.

11:40.333 --> 11:44.571
Are you ready
to become a star?

11:44.604 --> 11:46.373
I was born ready!

11:46.406 --> 11:47.775
Where do I sign?

11:47.808 --> 11:49.476
And do I
get an assistant?

11:50.510 --> 11:52.279
Sun Hi: My name's
Sun Hi Song.

11:52.312 --> 11:55.282
I'm a singer, dancer,
social media mogul, and--

11:55.315 --> 11:57.117
I'm forgetting one--

11:57.150 --> 12:00.120
Oh, yeah,
Icon of a generation.

12:00.153 --> 12:04.825
I've got a new title for your
show: The Sun Hi Also Rises.

12:04.858 --> 12:07.627
Sun Hi, this is supposed to
be my interview, not yours.

12:07.660 --> 12:08.528
Shhhhh!

12:08.561 --> 12:09.362
Starkie.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.331
Let's just focus on
Sun Hi for now

12:11.364 --> 12:14.467
and just see
where this goes.

12:14.501 --> 12:15.668
Can we take five?

12:15.702 --> 12:18.705
I need to get my lip gloss
and update the Sun Hi Nation.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.507
They like to
know my every move.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.375
Especially, my
aunt in New Jersey.

12:24.778 --> 12:26.279
Okay cut.

12:29.316 --> 12:30.350
Rabbit's foot--

12:30.383 --> 12:31.351
Check.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.285
Horseshoes--

12:32.319 --> 12:33.620
Check.

12:33.653 --> 12:34.454
Wishbone--

12:34.487 --> 12:36.623
Check.

12:36.656 --> 12:39.659
I got two dream catchers, a few
waving fortune cat figurines,

12:39.692 --> 12:48.168
meow, meow, meow,
meow, and this--

12:48.201 --> 12:49.702
Weird,
but good job.

12:49.736 --> 12:52.705
Now we weave them all into
a gigantic Ball of Good Luck.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.741
Once we hang this up
in the auditorium,

12:54.774 --> 12:57.710
that curse won't
stand a chance.

12:57.744 --> 12:58.812
Hey, wait a
minute--

12:58.846 --> 13:01.348
What's up?

13:01.381 --> 13:02.415
Are these your keys?

13:02.449 --> 13:03.316
Wow.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.585
Now all I need to
find is my earbuds,

13:05.618 --> 13:08.388
wallet and that other
thing I can't remember.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.932
Some people are saying, the
play isn't going to happen.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.400
Because the
curse struck again.

13:20.433 --> 13:21.902
I'm not sure
what to believe.

13:21.935 --> 13:24.271
On the one hand,
it doesn't sound real.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.405
But on the other?

13:25.438 --> 13:26.339
It's hard to believe

13:26.373 --> 13:28.275
Sun Hi would intentionally
break a mirror.

13:28.308 --> 13:32.312
They're like her
favorite things.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.680
Do you
believe in luck?

13:33.713 --> 13:36.516
You know, people do tell me,
I'm a very lucky person

13:36.549 --> 13:38.385
Cause you were
born an Adonis?

13:38.418 --> 13:39.486
No.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.521
That's good genes and
an irrational fear of carbs.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.756
I'm lucky because,
I met you.

13:43.790 --> 13:46.426
For someone who doesn't
eat sugar, you sure are sweet.

13:46.459 --> 13:49.229
Are you sure we need to
put our feelings on hold?

13:49.262 --> 13:51.932
My brain is saying it's
the logical thing to do.

13:51.965 --> 13:54.434
Gosh, I hate my
brain sometimes.

13:54.467 --> 14:00.773
Sure.

14:00.807 --> 14:01.841
See you later!

14:03.243 --> 14:05.445
And that's the
Sun Hi Nation update.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.780
I'm finally becoming
a web star--

14:07.814 --> 14:12.252
as if you ever
doubted it, Auntie!

14:12.285 --> 14:14.754
I don't know what
else I should say!

14:14.787 --> 14:16.856
I always wanted to
be a Broadway star,

14:16.890 --> 14:20.227
but I choked
in my big debut.

14:20.260 --> 14:24.898
And now, with another
shot, I'm choking again.

14:24.932 --> 14:30.003
I've always craved the spotlight
as much as Macbeth yearned

14:30.037 --> 14:38.011
the Scottish crown,
both tales end in tragedy.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.012
Okay, cut.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.714
Poor Mr. Stark.

14:41.748 --> 14:42.682
Oh no.

14:42.715 --> 14:47.354
I'm empathizing.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.623
Whoa, you were right
about your drama teacher.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.659
That Mr. Stark,
is a dud.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.861
Super downer.

14:54.894 --> 14:58.398
But you-- the
camera loves you.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.968
I'd like to discuss some
exciting opportunities.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.669
Really?

15:02.702 --> 15:06.773
I mean, I'd rather
you didn't.

15:06.806 --> 15:07.774
What?

15:07.807 --> 15:10.810
This isn't easy for me
to say, but here goes:

15:10.843 --> 15:13.913
You're right.
I'm awesome.

15:13.947 --> 15:18.585
But if this were my show and you
tried to dump me for Mr. Stark,

15:18.618 --> 15:20.020
I'd get hurt.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.721
This is his
chance at stardom.

15:21.754 --> 15:22.822
Give him a shot.

15:22.855 --> 15:25.959
Mine will come one day,
hopefully soon.

15:25.993 --> 15:26.960
There it is again.

15:26.994 --> 15:27.694
Empathy.

15:27.727 --> 15:28.928
Yuck.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.998
Do you realize what
you're turning down?

15:31.031 --> 15:32.132
Not exactly.

15:32.165 --> 15:34.701
So I'm going to run away
from you very fast before

15:34.734 --> 15:37.470
I have a chance to
change my mind.

15:41.841 --> 15:46.379
You guys, I think I may have
just, "done the right thing."

15:46.413 --> 15:48.381
You did something for
someone else for once?

15:48.415 --> 15:49.416
Worse!

15:49.449 --> 15:51.484
I did something for
another person for twice!

15:51.518 --> 15:54.754
I put in a good word for Mr.
Stark with his TV producer,

15:54.787 --> 15:56.589
and turned down an
opportunity for myself.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.491
And it feels--

15:58.525 --> 15:59.026
Good?

15:59.059 --> 16:00.327
Congrats, Sun Hi!

16:00.360 --> 16:01.528
I feel good too,

16:01.561 --> 16:04.564
Caleb and I hung a giant ball
of luck from the ceiling.

16:04.597 --> 16:12.405
To protect us from
the Macbeth curse.

16:12.439 --> 16:15.342
Good idea.

16:15.375 --> 16:19.112
Do you believe in
this curse, Corki?

16:19.146 --> 16:20.513
Corki?

16:20.547 --> 16:21.881
What's with you?

16:21.914 --> 16:24.651
Well, the days of Jared's
mixed signals are over.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.654
He's only sending
one signal now--

16:27.687 --> 16:30.590
I mean two!

16:35.962 --> 16:37.930
Caleb: Put your hearts
and minds together, for--

16:37.964 --> 16:40.967
XOIQ!

16:41.000 --> 16:49.909

17:51.604 --> 17:53.373

* Crazy style,

17:55.175 --> 17:56.443

Mr. Stark: Sun Hi!

19:04.811 --> 19:07.247
Stop right there!

19:07.280 --> 19:09.849
I can't believe
what I just heard.

19:09.882 --> 19:12.051
What do you have
to say for yourself?

19:14.854 --> 19:15.722
HaHa HaHa HaHa!

19:15.755 --> 19:16.756
Gotcha!

19:16.789 --> 19:19.259
Who says
I can't act?!

19:19.292 --> 19:22.028
Sun Hi,
I owe you one.

19:22.061 --> 19:22.995
Owe me one?

19:23.029 --> 19:24.197
Why?

19:24.231 --> 19:25.998
We'll you're the one that put
me in that ghastly video,

19:26.032 --> 19:28.034
which led to this
wretched reality show.

19:28.067 --> 19:28.835
Stay on the bus.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.036
I wanna see
where's he's going.

19:30.069 --> 19:33.640
It turns out some bigwigs in
New York caught wind of it,

19:33.673 --> 19:35.842
long story short, I have the
opportunity to audition

19:35.875 --> 19:39.846
for an honest-to goodness
Broadway musical!

19:39.879 --> 19:40.813
Wow!

19:40.847 --> 19:42.081
Congratulations!

19:42.114 --> 19:45.852
Stefan, the director, said you
had nice things to say about me.

19:45.885 --> 19:51.190
At first I was shocked,
then suspicious, then grateful.

19:51.224 --> 19:52.659
Thank you.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.126
You're welcome.

19:54.160 --> 19:57.096
But I'm sorry you have
to turn down that audition.

19:57.129 --> 19:58.798
Me too.

19:58.831 --> 19:59.532
Haha!

19:59.566 --> 20:01.868
I can't keep
a straight face.

20:01.901 --> 20:04.704
No, I leave tonight!

20:04.737 --> 20:06.306
What about The
Wonderful Wizard of Oz?

20:06.339 --> 20:07.874
You'll do fine
without me.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.609
You never listen
to me anyway.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.844
Besides, between the
chaos and the curse,

20:11.878 --> 20:14.146
the whole thing was
a bit of a shmozzle.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.682
How can
you say that?

20:15.715 --> 20:16.849
Your vision!

20:16.883 --> 20:19.819
If Ms. Diona has her way,
the only thing in my eyeline

20:19.852 --> 20:22.722
is unemployment and I don't
see how I should turn down

20:22.755 --> 20:25.658
the opportunity to
fulfill my heart's desire.

20:25.692 --> 20:29.161
And thanks to you,
I have a plane to catch!

20:30.897 --> 20:32.599
Ma-me-ma-
mo-mo-mo-ma.

20:32.632 --> 20:34.634
Oh, and Sun Hi?

20:34.667 --> 20:36.336
I'm sorry about
the casting.

20:36.369 --> 20:40.139
You would have
made a great Dorothy.

20:40.172 --> 20:42.875
This is what I get for
showing you empathy?

20:42.909 --> 20:43.910
Ugh!

20:44.911 --> 20:47.714
Corki: I guess the Good
Luck Ball didn't work.

20:47.747 --> 20:52.251
Mr. Stark leaving is just
one more strike against us.

20:52.285 --> 20:54.253
You were right to
stay out of it.

20:54.287 --> 20:55.254
If this play
doesn't happen,

20:55.288 --> 20:57.890
I'm just have to find
something else to do.

20:57.924 --> 21:00.192
Like start to
plan senior prom.

21:00.226 --> 21:02.662
I wonder who my
lucky date will be.

21:22.048 --> 21:23.850
No matter what
else has gone wrong,

21:23.883 --> 21:26.786
right now,
everything is perfect.

22:03.423 --> 22:13.433
*

22:13.466 --> 22:23.676
*

22:23.710 --> 22:33.085
*
