WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:13.096
Follow yourselfTo the top of a mountain

00:13.180 --> 00:15.682
Answer the callYeah, be the believer

00:15.766 --> 00:18.852
Throw your fears like a wishInto a fountain

00:19.436 --> 00:22.898
Like a warrior

00:22.981 --> 00:25.192
Whatever you might beWhoever you are

00:25.275 --> 00:28.904
You're a warrior

00:31.114 --> 00:33.242
"O Prickly, where art thou?"

00:36.119 --> 00:37.746
Ready?

00:37.829 --> 00:41.416
Andâ€¦ get it!

00:43.794 --> 00:44.795
Nice, Pony.

00:44.878 --> 00:49.216
This made packing so easy.Why doesn't everyone do it this way?

00:51.301 --> 00:53.428
Hey. You ready, bud?

00:53.512 --> 00:55.430
The Lil Rumblers' cart will be hereany minute.

00:55.514 --> 00:58.934
Yep. I've got my tent, my sleeping bag,

00:59.017 --> 01:01.186
my mini lance for roasting marshmallows, my mini lance for roasting marshmallows,

01:01.270 --> 01:02.604
and carrots!

01:04.438 --> 01:08.193
Everything we needfor the biggest night of our lives:

01:08.277 --> 01:12.281
our overnight stay in the Fearsome Forest.

01:12.364 --> 01:14.867
-Yeah!-Hey, what about Prickly?

01:18.495 --> 01:19.872
No, no, Pony.

01:19.955 --> 01:22.583
I can't bring Prickly ona Lil Rumblers trip.

01:22.666 --> 01:25.711
But you've had himeven longer than you've had Pony.

01:25.794 --> 01:29.965
When you were littleand it was dark and scary,

01:30.048 --> 01:33.135
his squawk always made you feel safe.

01:38.223 --> 01:40.851
Prickly might have helped mewhen I was little,

01:40.934 --> 01:43.729
but I'm a grown-up warrior now.

01:43.812 --> 01:47.316
I don't think anyone will careif you're a warrior with a stuffy.

01:47.399 --> 01:51.862
Gladys will. This overnight isa test of a warrior's bravery.

01:51.945 --> 01:56.074
If she finds out about Prickly,I'll be laughed out of the Lil Rumblers.

01:56.158 --> 01:57.284
I don't know, bud.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.828
You've never spent the nightin the Fearsome Forest.

01:59.912 --> 02:02.623
It can be, you know, fearsome. It can be, you know, fearsome.

02:03.999 --> 02:05.876
It's the Lil Rumblers. Gotta go!

02:08.461 --> 02:09.505
What, no goodbye?

02:12.049 --> 02:16.220
Fare thee well, dear parents.

02:17.429 --> 02:21.099
We shall meet againupon my epic return fromâ€¦

02:21.725 --> 02:23.936
The Fearsome Forest.

02:26.063 --> 02:31.485
Home to griffins, ghouls, grims,and 58 kinds of carnivorous mold.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.403
This shall be fun.

02:35.697 --> 02:39.493
Now then, how many of you are onyour first overnight?

02:39.576 --> 02:42.412
My first overnight was last year.

02:42.496 --> 02:46.375
So when you younger kids get nervous,I'll be happy to help!

02:51.255 --> 02:52.673
Well, take heed.

02:52.756 --> 02:55.968
This expedition is notfor the faint of heart.

02:56.051 --> 03:00.681
Here you shall prove your braveryby facing a gauntlet of your fears. Here you shall prove your braveryby facing a gauntlet of your fears.

03:02.266 --> 03:03.851
It can't be that scary.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.854
You shall navigate harsh terrain,

03:06.937 --> 03:09.690
make your way through dark woods,

03:09.773 --> 03:13.277
and even confront wild beasts!

03:18.574 --> 03:22.452
That was a well-timed howl.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.789
I will never forget my first overnight.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.916
There I was, all alone,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.752
when a land-kraken burst out of the woods!

03:30.836 --> 03:32.713
But was I afraid? No!

03:32.796 --> 03:37.759
I summoned all my courageand arm-wrestled it like this.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.553
And like this.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.097
It had many arms, you see.

03:42.723 --> 03:47.853
Well, if Gladys can handle it,we can handle it. Right, Pony?

03:49.855 --> 03:51.356
Hey! Wait for us!

03:53.066 --> 03:55.861
It is time to set up your beds, Rumblers.

03:55.944 --> 03:59.907
Then we shall gather woodto feed our glorious campfire.

04:02.159 --> 04:04.870
What do you think of our tent, pal?

04:11.376 --> 04:12.377
Need help, Pinecone?

04:12.961 --> 04:15.380
Who, me? No.

04:15.464 --> 04:22.095
I said, "Aah! Love that crisp forest air."

04:23.680 --> 04:25.891
I didn't hear a weird noise.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.729
Pony, I said not to bring Prickly.

04:32.481 --> 04:33.982
It's okay.

04:34.066 --> 04:37.903
It'll be fine.Just as long as Gladys doesn't see.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.154
Surprise inspection!

04:39.238 --> 04:40.531
Oh, no. No, no.

04:40.614 --> 04:43.242
Prepare to have your bedsthoroughly examined.

04:46.161 --> 04:47.246
Lovely, Annabelle.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.916
Yes, nice placement, Peregrine.

04:52.084 --> 04:54.920
Oatcake, is that honeyon your sleeping bag?

04:56.046 --> 04:57.673
-Yep.-Excellent.

04:59.174 --> 05:00.843
What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?

05:03.053 --> 05:04.263
Very good, Pinecone.

05:04.930 --> 05:07.891
Are you feeling all right?

05:08.809 --> 05:10.018
Who, us? We're great.

05:10.102 --> 05:14.106
Just two brave warriors ready to doa brave afternoon of being brave.

05:17.234 --> 05:20.153
That was close. Come on.

05:21.572 --> 05:23.782
Sorry for throwing you, Prickly.But you get it.

05:23.866 --> 05:28.412
We'll make you a nice cozy hiding spotright at the bottom of my bag and--

05:28.495 --> 05:29.496
Prickly?

05:30.706 --> 05:34.293
Prickly? Come on out, pal.This isn't funny.

05:34.376 --> 05:35.878
Where could he have gone?

05:39.047 --> 05:42.259
Of course. Something must have taken him.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.011
A kitten.

05:45.220 --> 05:47.890
A big kitten?

05:47.973 --> 05:49.516
Well, whatever it was,

05:49.600 --> 05:51.643
I'm gonna follow these tracksand find him.

05:53.854 --> 05:57.649
No! We can't tell the others,or they'll know I still have a stuffy.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.818
We have to do this by ourselves.

05:59.902 --> 06:02.362
We can do this. For Prickly. We can do this. For Prickly.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.252
He's actually kinda cute.

06:18.337 --> 06:22.257
Who's a wittle stinker? Yes--

06:24.426 --> 06:26.011
Run.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.685
Follow me.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.855
That wasn't so bad Pony?

06:39.733 --> 06:41.902
Coming.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.405
For Prickly.

06:46.365 --> 06:47.658
For Prickly.

06:54.331 --> 06:58.293
Land-kraken! Run!

07:14.685 --> 07:15.769
I'm okay.

07:17.396 --> 07:20.732
Why couldn't this be easy?

07:24.069 --> 07:27.322
Prickly! He's gotta be close!

07:29.241 --> 07:33.787
Pony, we've already faced spooky woods,bramble, and a kraken.

07:33.871 --> 07:37.165
Nothing, nothing is worse than that.

07:42.713 --> 07:45.382
Except for maybe a huge griffin.

07:48.302 --> 07:52.723
I came this far,and I'm not giving up on him now.

07:53.849 --> 07:55.517
Easy.

07:57.436 --> 07:59.354
Easyâ€¦

08:09.072 --> 08:11.450
Hey! Come back!

08:14.912 --> 08:17.289
No!

08:17.372 --> 08:19.333
Please.

08:19.416 --> 08:22.127
Please let me climb you.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.965
I can't do it, Pony.

08:27.049 --> 08:30.344
He's gone, and it's all my fault.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.972
I was wrong, Prickly.

08:34.056 --> 08:36.308
I do need you.

08:36.390 --> 08:39.102
I'm not ready to let my stuffy go.

08:39.186 --> 08:42.105
I'd do anything to get you back.

08:44.525 --> 08:50.364
We came to find youwhen you did not show up for the campfire.

08:51.031 --> 08:55.410
Did I say "my stuffy"?I meant Pony's stuffy.

08:55.494 --> 08:58.330
I was using the royal "my."

08:59.498 --> 09:01.750
Who am I kidding? Who am I kidding?

09:03.502 --> 09:07.422
I, Pinecone, sleep with a stuffy.

09:07.506 --> 09:10.175
His name is Prickly. I love him tons.

09:10.259 --> 09:13.470
A griffin stole him. And I want him back.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.267
I, too, have a stuffy.

09:18.350 --> 09:20.936
I have a stuffy.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.856
I have three stuffies,but I just brought one.

09:24.439 --> 09:26.942
I do not have a stuffy.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.736
I have a blankie!

09:30.821 --> 09:32.656
All right!

09:32.739 --> 09:37.160
What are we waiting for?Let us retrieve Sir Prickly!

09:37.244 --> 09:38.245
Yes!

09:42.708 --> 09:44.376
Still too low.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.090
Yes.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.735
-Holding. Holding.-What's going on?

10:09.818 --> 10:10.819
Did she get him?

10:13.864 --> 10:14.907
We got Prickly!

10:14.990 --> 10:16.658
I can see my house from here.

10:20.829 --> 10:23.749
Never have I been prouderof a group of Lil Rumblers.

10:23.832 --> 10:26.210
This was an epic display of bravery.

10:27.169 --> 10:28.212
Really?

10:28.295 --> 10:31.089
I was kinda worriedyou might think less of me.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.342
Why ever would you think that?

10:33.425 --> 10:39.389
Well, 'cause stuffies are for little kids,not brave warriors.

10:40.057 --> 10:43.185
Loving a stuffydoesn't make you less brave.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.562
Love is the thing that makes you brave.

10:45.646 --> 10:50.150
How else could you have gone throughall those trials to find Prickly?

10:52.194 --> 10:56.240
Besides, everyone has a stuffy, even me.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.283
Introducing Belinda.

11:02.037 --> 11:05.040
Now then,this campfire needs a spooky story.

11:05.582 --> 11:08.293
Annabelle, could you help us with that?

11:08.377 --> 11:09.586
Really?

11:09.670 --> 11:14.633
I mean, I could help if you want.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.426
It was a dark, fall evening

11:16.510 --> 11:21.181
when a strong, tough, mature-for-her-agegirl named Annabelle

11:21.265 --> 11:26.103
goes into a spooky, dark forestto help a friendâ€¦

11:26.186 --> 11:27.896
I'm glad you're here, Prickly.

11:32.776 --> 11:35.112
"Big trouble in Lil Labyrinth."

11:38.532 --> 11:42.035
Lil Rumblers, fall in!

11:42.119 --> 11:44.204
Rumble, rumble, tough and nimble

11:44.288 --> 11:46.206
Little warriors never tremble

11:46.290 --> 11:48.000
We are mighty, we are brave

11:48.083 --> 11:49.877
Now it's time to learn our names

11:49.960 --> 11:51.879
-Annabelle!-Oatcake!

11:51.962 --> 11:53.672
-Peregrine!-Rhino!

11:53.755 --> 11:55.632
Pinecone and Pony!

11:55.716 --> 11:58.051
We're the Lil Rumblers!

11:58.135 --> 12:00.596
I do not rememberteaching you that ending. I do not rememberteaching you that ending.

12:00.679 --> 12:02.014
But you get extra points

12:02.097 --> 12:04.266
for such an effectivedistraction technique.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.310
We're just pumped for the Gauntlet.

12:07.686 --> 12:09.062
I can't believe it.

12:09.146 --> 12:12.941
We're finally going to facethe most unforgiving obstacle course ever!

12:13.025 --> 12:19.531
And one of us can even winthe MVW title for "most valuable warrior."

12:19.615 --> 12:22.576
Gauntlet, Gauntlet, Gauntlet.

12:22.659 --> 12:26.747
The Gauntlet has been canceleddue to unfortunate circumstances.

12:26.830 --> 12:31.168
Some hydras mistook it for a mud spa,and now it is a protected reserve.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.337
What are we supposed to do now?

12:34.546 --> 12:38.842
Hello, Lil Rumblers!

12:39.885 --> 12:42.971
What's the leader of the Wiz Kidsgonna challenge us with,

12:43.055 --> 12:44.932
turning a toad into a teapot?

12:45.015 --> 12:48.560
But I only knowhow to turn my hand into a fist.

12:49.728 --> 12:54.399
Then I suppose you're not interested inthe Labyrinth-inth-nth.

12:54.483 --> 12:56.276
The Labyrinth?

12:56.360 --> 13:02.032
A course you'll find just as challenging,if not more so, than the Gauntlet. A course you'll find just as challenging,if not more so, than the Gauntlet.

13:02.115 --> 13:06.912
It sounds cool.But will it test our warrior skills?

13:08.247 --> 13:12.709
The Labyrinth will putall your most powerful skills to the test.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.545
Then count us in.

13:14.628 --> 13:18.507
Yeah! We got gold starsin crushing any obstacle,

13:18.590 --> 13:20.968
Lil Rumblers style!

13:21.051 --> 13:23.303
They did. I gave them out last week.

13:23.387 --> 13:24.763
Excellent.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.807
Each test comes with a time limit.

13:26.890 --> 13:33.647
So remember to keep moving, have fun,and expect the fun-expected.

13:39.403 --> 13:40.404
Okay.

13:40.487 --> 13:44.491
On your marks, get set, go!

13:51.248 --> 13:54.293
Okay, this iscompletely different than usual.

13:56.170 --> 13:58.463
There's no doorknob or handle.

13:58.547 --> 14:03.260
That's probably because it's a trick doorto test our warrior strength. That's probably because it's a trick doorto test our warrior strength.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.678
Clear the way.

14:04.761 --> 14:07.931
Warrior charge!

14:10.642 --> 14:12.227
I must've not charged up enough.

14:13.395 --> 14:15.689
Even the walls are rubbery.

14:15.772 --> 14:18.942
How are we supposed to doany bashing in this place?

14:22.321 --> 14:23.697
Pony.

14:28.702 --> 14:31.038
The circles make sounds.

14:31.121 --> 14:36.001
Maybe if we play the soundsin the right order, the door will open?

14:36.084 --> 14:37.753
That's a great idea,

14:37.836 --> 14:41.548
but I'm better with movementthan with music.

14:42.549 --> 14:47.054
Maybe we can just stomp on 'em alluntil we figure it out.

14:48.222 --> 14:49.306
Stomp.

14:50.349 --> 14:51.433
Stomp.

14:52.559 --> 14:55.771
Those aren't constellations above us.

14:55.854 --> 14:57.814
They're music notes.

14:59.816 --> 15:00.817
-Huh?-Huh? -Huh?-Huh?

15:00.901 --> 15:02.778
Do you mind if I give it a try?

15:15.415 --> 15:17.251
What? I'm a harpist.

15:17.334 --> 15:20.796
It's not exactly something that comes upat the training yard.

15:20.879 --> 15:23.841
You're a shoo-in for MVW.

15:24.591 --> 15:25.801
That was very impressive.

15:27.803 --> 15:32.182
If you're all that interested,I'll invite you to my next harp recital.

15:32.266 --> 15:33.392
Now let's get going!

15:33.475 --> 15:35.519
There's a time limit, remember?

15:37.104 --> 15:40.357
Wow. Now, this room looksready for adventure.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.441
Yeah.

15:42.526 --> 15:44.194
Everyone, grab a vine.

15:44.278 --> 15:46.113
We'll probably need to swing on them,

15:46.196 --> 15:48.991
which is greatbecause I've been practicing my climbing.

15:51.285 --> 15:55.247
Actually, I think this might havesomething to do with the challenge.

15:57.499 --> 16:02.212
I'm a pair of hearts and mindssailing you through precious times. I'm a pair of hearts and mindssailing you through precious times.

16:02.296 --> 16:07.134
You cannot use me as a boat,but together we can stay afloat.

16:07.718 --> 16:09.678
It's a trick. Everyone, look out.

16:10.846 --> 16:14.183
"Trick" is incorrect.Two more guesses remain.

16:15.434 --> 16:18.103
No, Pinecone,I think we have to solve a riddle.

16:18.187 --> 16:24.067
Let's see. "Hearts and minds,"and something about a boat.

16:24.151 --> 16:25.277
I'm stumped.

16:25.360 --> 16:26.778
Yeah, it's a toughie.

16:27.613 --> 16:31.158
"Toughie" is incorrect.One more guess remains.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.286
Okay, no one else say anythingunless you know the an--

16:34.369 --> 16:37.456
It's friendship. The answer is friendship.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.751
That is correct.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.463
-Yeah!-Success!

16:44.546 --> 16:47.090
Oatcake, how did you know that?

16:47.174 --> 16:52.429
I love riddles! I answer some every nightbefore my sister tucks me in.

16:52.513 --> 16:55.349
Hurry now.The clock is ticking. Don't be late.

16:55.432 --> 16:56.683
This way.

16:58.769 --> 17:02.397
I thought these challenges would involveflexing our warrior muscles, I thought these challenges would involveflexing our warrior muscles,

17:02.481 --> 17:07.944
but where are the climbing walls,the punching bags, the mud pits?

17:08.028 --> 17:09.738
Everything I've been practicing?

17:11.114 --> 17:12.241
You coming, Pinecone?

17:12.324 --> 17:14.201
Yep. On my way.

17:14.284 --> 17:18.579
Just getting into the zonefor our next challenge.

17:18.664 --> 17:20.249
I hope it's something I'm good at.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.670
Well, this looks simple.The door's already open.

17:28.382 --> 17:30.551
Nice save, Peregrine.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.428
The red tiles are traps.

17:35.347 --> 17:39.017
Which means green's safeand is our path to the other side.

17:39.977 --> 17:43.814
How will we step on just the green ones?The colors are switching so randomly.

17:44.565 --> 17:45.691
That's not random.

17:45.774 --> 17:47.693
They're changing color on a pattern.

17:47.776 --> 17:51.071
The greens are goingleft, forward, right, back.

17:52.656 --> 17:55.659
What? I happen to bea blue-ribbon math mechanic,

17:55.742 --> 17:58.036
and I'm excellent at spotting patterns.

17:58.120 --> 18:01.415
And look,there's a button on the other side. And look,there's a button on the other side.

18:01.498 --> 18:04.585
I bet if we push it,the squishers will stop squishing.

18:04.668 --> 18:06.587
That's awesome, Rhino.

18:06.670 --> 18:11.967
But even knowing where to step,you'd still have to be superfast to cross.

18:12.968 --> 18:13.969
I'm superfast!

18:15.095 --> 18:16.722
It'll take more than just speed.

18:16.805 --> 18:21.059
It'll take the flexibility and agilityof a ballet dancer.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.062
I've been taking lessonssince I could walk.

18:24.146 --> 18:27.900
I don't have the right shoes,but I can make it work.

18:27.983 --> 18:31.320
Okay, we'll goon the start of the next cycle.

18:31.403 --> 18:34.364
Get ready. And go!

18:34.448 --> 18:37.701
Left. Forward. Right. Back.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.870
-You can do it!-Be careful!

18:40.787 --> 18:42.122
Watch out!

18:42.206 --> 18:44.958
Get ready for the last one.You have to wait for it.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.303
Yes! We did it!

18:56.386 --> 18:58.889
That was amazing!

18:59.681 --> 19:01.016
Thanks to your guidance. Thanks to your guidance.

19:01.099 --> 19:02.601
How's this possible?

19:02.684 --> 19:05.270
Everyone has such cool talentsI didn't know about.

19:05.854 --> 19:08.524
You're doing great.You're almost done.

19:08.607 --> 19:12.402
The last room awaits.Then you'll have finished.

19:12.486 --> 19:14.696
How do I turn this off?

19:14.780 --> 19:16.532
Come on. We better hurry.

19:16.615 --> 19:17.824
What's wrong, Pinecone?

19:19.201 --> 19:22.579
I was just thinkingmaybe we should go back to the beginning?

19:22.663 --> 19:24.248
What?

19:24.331 --> 19:27.876
Why would we go back?We've gone forward this whole time.

19:27.960 --> 19:32.714
Isn't that suspicious?This has been so easy for all of you.

19:32.798 --> 19:35.175
We're obviously heading into a trap.

19:35.259 --> 19:37.594
Even if it's a trap, we can beat it.

19:37.678 --> 19:40.764
We got gold starsin crushing any obstacle.

19:40.848 --> 19:43.517
Lil Rumblers style, remember?

19:43.600 --> 19:46.979
But none of our Lil Rumblers skillsare being tested here.

19:47.062 --> 19:50.566
And you've all gotthese other talents to show off.

19:50.649 --> 19:53.735
I've got nothing.

19:53.819 --> 19:56.113
It's okay, Pinecone. Don't give up.

19:58.532 --> 20:02.119
Okay. Let's go. I'll crush this. Okay. Let's go. I'll crush this.

20:03.328 --> 20:04.454
There's a door under there.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.129
The ropes are blocking the exit.

20:12.212 --> 20:14.923
-Should we let them hit us?-That might hurt.

20:15.007 --> 20:17.676
We just have to jump, of course.It's easy.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.970
Me and my parents playthis game all the time.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.972
It's called double dragon.

20:22.055 --> 20:25.601
The ropes are the dragons,and all you have to do is avoid them.

20:25.684 --> 20:27.102
Haven't you played it?

20:27.186 --> 20:28.896
This is your talent, Pinecone.

20:28.979 --> 20:33.192
It's not really a talent.It's not really anything.

20:33.275 --> 20:36.278
It's just a game I play for fun.Anyone can do it.

20:39.865 --> 20:42.409
That's just too fast. Even for me.

20:43.452 --> 20:44.828
I don't know.

20:51.460 --> 20:53.754
Don't worry, pal. I've got you.

20:53.837 --> 20:54.838
Jump with me.

20:55.547 --> 20:59.551
Down by the river of SturdystoneA friendly ogre made his home

20:59.635 --> 21:03.555
He did not use brick or stoneHow many days did it weather the storm? He did not use brick or stoneHow many days did it weather the storm?

21:03.639 --> 21:05.265
One, two, three

21:05.349 --> 21:07.476
Great job, pal.

21:07.559 --> 21:09.102
How do I jump in without getting hit?

21:09.186 --> 21:12.481
It's easy. Just use a rhythmthat matches the pace of the rope.

21:14.066 --> 21:15.943
I got it! Our roll call.

21:16.026 --> 21:17.945
Rumble, rumble, tough and nimble

21:18.028 --> 21:19.821
Little warriors never tremble

21:19.905 --> 21:23.492
We are mighty, we are braveNow it's time to learn our names

21:23.575 --> 21:25.661
-Annabelle!-Oatcake!

21:25.744 --> 21:27.496
-Peregrine!-Rhino!

21:27.579 --> 21:29.206
Pinecone and Pony!

21:30.415 --> 21:32.292
We're the Lil Rumblers!

21:37.548 --> 21:41.218
That was so cool! Can we go again?

21:41.301 --> 21:45.138
Yeah! We totally crushed it.

21:45.222 --> 21:48.308
In recognition of your completionof the Labyrinth,

21:48.392 --> 21:54.273
we have decided to grant you alla most valuable warrior token.

21:54.356 --> 21:56.191
We all get tokens?

21:59.653 --> 22:04.116
You all displayed exemplary skillsto help your group succeed. You all displayed exemplary skillsto help your group succeed.

22:04.199 --> 22:08.829
Proving that any talent,no matter how big or small, is valuable.

22:11.415 --> 22:14.376
Well, I didn't get to show offmy warrior moves,

22:14.459 --> 22:15.836
but there's always next time.

22:15.919 --> 22:17.504
Wanna go play some double dragon?

22:17.588 --> 22:18.714
Can we play too?

22:18.797 --> 22:19.923
I'll hold the rope.

22:20.007 --> 22:21.508
-I'll hold it too.-Yeah!

22:23.427 --> 22:26.430
Me as well.Have you heard this one?

22:26.513 --> 22:32.519
One-eyed cyclops broke my bonesHow many stones did he throw?

22:35.397 --> 22:37.274
You and I

22:37.357 --> 22:40.027
Adventurers brave and free

22:40.903 --> 22:45.157
Side by sideTogether we'll always be

22:45.240 --> 22:49.745
Thick as thieves

22:50.787 --> 22:55.209
Thick as thieves
