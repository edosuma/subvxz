OUR HAPPY SONG.

00:13.814 --> 00:15.381

A HAPPY SONG.

00:15.383 --> 00:16.715

YOUR DAUGHTER,

02:42.062 --> 02:44.630
BUT I TOO HAVE
VALUE IN THIS WORLD.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.798

WHAT IS THE SECRET
OF LIFE?

03:07.488 --> 03:09.721

CARED ENOUGH ABOUT ME

03:13.961 --> 03:15.093

LUCAS FRIAR

03:21.602 --> 03:23.101

03:23.103 --> 03:24.903

MORAL COMPASS.

03:26.407 --> 03:27.606
OKAY.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.442
SOMETHING BAD
IS HAPPENING, MAYA.

03:30.444 --> 03:31.610
YEAH.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.512
IT OCCURS TO ME
YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL US

03:33.514 --> 03:35.047
RANGER RICK WAS A LITTLE
DIFFERENT BACK IN TEXAS.

03:35.049 --> 03:36.648
A LITTLE?

03:36.650 --> 03:38.116
WHAT DO THEY
KNOW, EXACTLY?

03:38.118 --> 03:39.685
'CAUSE I WOULDN'T WANNA
SAY ANYTHING WRONG.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.386

A YEAR OLDER, RIGHT?

03:41.388 --> 03:42.654

MR. BABINEAUX.

03:49.597 --> 03:50.963
OH, SO YOU KNOW
ABOUT HIM?

03:50.965 --> 03:53.131

MR. FRIAR.

04:05.479 --> 04:06.845

THE WAY I SEE IT,

18:36.850 --> 18:39.450

BUT I'M GONNA
TELL YOU SOMETHING,

18:45.358 --> 18:46.858

TAKEN HIM, RIGHT?

19:25.532 --> 19:27.482

19:27.483 --> 19:29.433

YOURSELF IN THESE SITUATIONS?

A FRIEND IN TEXAS

19:45.418 --> 19:47.418
AND HE MOVED AWAY AND I
MISSED HANGING OUT
WITH HIM.

19:47.420 --> 19:48.920

MY ENTIRE FAMILY
