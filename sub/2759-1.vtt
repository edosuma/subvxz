01:29.740 --> 01:31.231
Ever since I can remember...

01:31.508 --> 01:35.240
it was always my sister and me against the big,
bad world.

02:17.721 --> 02:18.988
I am telling you guys...

02:18.989 --> 02:22.357
you are so gonna dig our new crib.
It's really cool.

02:22.726 --> 02:27.096
So far, I've counted seven pawn shops and...

02:27.097 --> 02:28.498
11 liquor stores.

02:28.499 --> 02:30.695
No. You're gonna love it.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.468
It's got way more space than our other place...

02:32.469 --> 02:34.938
it's got really cool shopping nearby,
there's a mall.

02:35.706 --> 02:38.039
And it's a chance for us to make a fresh start.

02:38.742 --> 02:41.075
It's gonna be kick-ass.

02:41.345 --> 02:43.940
Can you please not say kick-ass?

02:44.014 --> 02:46.813
Or dig? Or you know, crib?

02:48.018 --> 02:50.817
Okay, Beth.
Sorry that I don't know the lingo.

02:50.854 --> 02:52.083
Sorry that I'm not so hip.

02:52.122 --> 02:54.182
Can't I go live with my dad?

02:56.126 --> 02:57.458
No.

02:57.961 --> 02:59.930
I honestly can't remember a time...

02:59.997 --> 03:03.559
when my sister and
I didn't cling to each other like velcro.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.836
God, we slept in the same crib
till we were four.

03:06.837 --> 03:10.035
Bobby didn't show up till Boyfriend Five.
Maybe Six.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.097
He's seven.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.673
Okay, you gotta get up and help now.

03:14.745 --> 03:17.340
- I can't do it all by myself.
- As if.

03:17.748 --> 03:18.579
Come on, Sandra.

03:20.384 --> 03:21.477
Okay.

03:24.388 --> 03:25.988
- Come here!
- Oh, shit!

03:25.989 --> 03:27.723
You gotta get off me, you cretin!

03:27.724 --> 03:30.091
Why so glum chum? Smile!

03:30.127 --> 03:34.428
Our new shack is, shall we say... uninspired.

03:34.531 --> 03:37.660
- Oh, don't be sad. I hate it, I hate it.
- I am sad.

03:37.734 --> 03:40.932
- Please, please, please!
- Okay, just get off me!

03:41.238 --> 03:44.436
Okay, I say that we do a "what if."

03:44.474 --> 03:47.034
You know, like, like what if...

03:47.110 --> 03:50.945
there is a hidden laboratory in the basement?

03:51.114 --> 03:53.616
And, not unlike
the imaginings of Mary Shelley...

03:53.617 --> 03:57.452
we build the perfect monster?

03:57.487 --> 04:00.122
Did you say the perfect mother?

04:00.123 --> 04:02.124
What's up, baby girls?

04:02.125 --> 04:06.128
We gotta do way less unpacking
and way more buying you guys shit at the mall.

04:06.129 --> 04:08.497
- Yes!
- That's just impractical.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.866
Strawberry cupcakes? Your favorite.

04:10.867 --> 04:13.002
She's so sweet! I like her.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.870
No.

04:14.871 --> 04:15.600
Boring.

04:16.106 --> 04:17.074
Namaste.

04:17.975 --> 04:19.108
- We kinda need that.
- Too zen.

04:19.108 --> 04:20.610
The spiritual thing would get on my nerves.

04:20.611 --> 04:22.745
- Love the Chanel suit.
- Money!

04:22.746 --> 04:26.015
- Money's good. Money is important, but...
- Money!

04:26.016 --> 04:28.042
Oh, my god!

04:29.386 --> 04:31.082
That's you in 20 years, you know that!

04:31.488 --> 04:33.923
So many moms, so little time.

04:34.625 --> 04:37.720
All of them good, none of them perfect.

04:38.729 --> 04:40.363
Yeah, but she looks hot.

04:40.364 --> 04:42.265
I don't even think that's her face.
I mean...

04:42.266 --> 04:43.234
Stop it.

04:52.109 --> 04:53.099
Hey.

04:54.144 --> 04:57.246
I know that moving again
was the last thing you girls needed.

04:57.247 --> 05:00.081
And I'm so sorry we had to do it again.

05:00.851 --> 05:03.946
But I know this is gonna sound really corny...

05:05.088 --> 05:07.123
I really believe...

05:07.124 --> 05:10.960
that we can overcome anything together.

05:10.961 --> 05:14.964
- Okay. Okay, can we keep her?
- Look! The babies are dead!

05:14.965 --> 05:15.732
What happened?

05:15.733 --> 05:19.001
Sometimes when a hamster-mom
feels like her babies are in danger...

05:19.002 --> 05:22.271
they'll kill them so they won't have to go
through the pain of someone else doing it.

05:22.272 --> 05:26.509
You see, not many kids have had to deal...
with the things weve had to deal with.

05:26.510 --> 05:30.709
So there aren't really many people out
there who can understand us.

05:31.248 --> 05:33.249
I mean, all weve really got...

05:33.250 --> 05:35.810
all well ever really have, is each other.

05:36.987 --> 05:38.080
Meet the neighbors.

05:39.723 --> 05:40.918
Yes!

05:45.028 --> 05:47.964
- Welcome home.
- Ta-da!

05:48.365 --> 05:50.499
See? It really is gonna be great here.

05:50.500 --> 05:51.500
Are you shitting me?

05:51.501 --> 05:52.594
Language, Beth.

05:53.737 --> 05:55.504
They gave me graveyard tonight, but...

05:55.505 --> 05:57.006
I guess it's a start, right?

05:57.007 --> 05:59.499
And if you weren't working,
youd be making duck a la orange, right?

06:00.977 --> 06:02.343
I'm really trying.

06:03.146 --> 06:06.583
And I would appreciate just a little bit
of positivity from you.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.216
Okay.

06:15.025 --> 06:17.259
Oh! Wish me good luck.

06:17.260 --> 06:18.091
Good luck.

06:19.096 --> 06:20.587
Thanks.

06:24.735 --> 06:27.603
Now, when you've lived in
as many places as we have...

06:27.604 --> 06:29.972
you develop an ability
to make yourself at home...

06:29.973 --> 06:32.101
faster than the average Josephine.

06:41.852 --> 06:45.812
And the most crucial of
all interior design elements is lighting.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.585
I mean, good lighting can hide anything.

06:54.131 --> 06:55.827
Okay. So?

06:56.366 --> 06:57.800
What do you think?

07:01.505 --> 07:03.239
Hottie or nottie?

07:03.240 --> 07:05.741
Sometimes I'm amazed
we share the same genetic material.

07:05.742 --> 07:07.472
Didn't answer the question.

07:08.145 --> 07:10.379
I've always known
I was destined for greatness.

07:10.380 --> 07:13.849
And senior year?
That's when the clock starts ticking.

07:13.850 --> 07:17.987
I mean, if you're gonna win the Nobel Prize,
a Pulitzer, and an Oscar...

07:17.988 --> 07:19.718
this is when ya gotta start bringin it.

07:20.624 --> 07:21.455
You know, Beth...

07:22.726 --> 07:27.029
you are just a junior.
Okay? A little tiny caterpillar...

07:27.030 --> 07:29.131
who can't even begin to appreciate...

07:29.132 --> 07:32.501
the magnitude of my butterfly-ness.

07:32.502 --> 07:33.470
Kay?

07:34.271 --> 07:35.239
You will someday.

07:35.739 --> 07:38.107
Everybody I know has always thought...

07:38.108 --> 07:40.242
"Why would something big
ever happen to me?"

07:40.243 --> 07:43.112
And I've always thought,
"Well, why wouldn't it?"

07:43.113 --> 07:44.103
Suit yourself.

07:45.248 --> 07:48.250
Oh, wow, that's dark.

07:48.251 --> 07:51.253
You want the limelight,
I wanna be in Twilight.

07:51.254 --> 07:54.023
Actually, I'd settle for just a single spotlight.

07:54.024 --> 07:55.822
Come here, I'm gonna drink your blood!

08:07.003 --> 08:09.271
It's amazing
what one little summer break can do.

08:09.272 --> 08:13.607
I mean, I almost forgot how Banana Republic
the general pop is around here.

08:15.512 --> 08:18.747
Oh, my god. He is so fetching.

08:18.748 --> 08:21.750
You think that I have a shot
with him now that I've got the new look?

08:21.751 --> 08:24.253
Yes, Sandra.
I'm sure the captain of the football team...

08:24.254 --> 08:28.055
is dying to take a slutty welfare chick to prom.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.092
Well, he is dating Ashley.

08:30.093 --> 08:33.222
Whatever. I'd disown you if you actually
went out on a date with that stump.

08:34.030 --> 08:35.498
Goth Lord, ten oclock.

08:35.499 --> 08:37.099
I think that's Justin Ross.

08:37.100 --> 08:40.503
You know a guy 10 years, you only wanna
blow him when he starts wearing mascara.

08:40.504 --> 08:42.605
It's amazing
what one little summer break can do.

08:42.606 --> 08:43.698
What's with you?

08:45.609 --> 08:46.440
What's with her?

08:48.512 --> 08:49.605
She's a senior now.

09:03.727 --> 09:05.093
Come on. First day of school!

09:14.971 --> 09:17.840
Isn't it like so cute
when juniors fall in love?

09:17.841 --> 09:19.207
- So cute!
- Yeah.

09:27.484 --> 09:30.486
So your mom moved away
over the summer break...

09:30.487 --> 09:32.488
but the two of you moved in with your aunt...

09:32.489 --> 09:35.024
because she still lives
in this school district?

09:35.025 --> 09:37.626
Yes. Yeah, we discussed it as a family...

09:37.627 --> 09:40.496
and we came to the conclusion
that since I'm now a senior...

09:40.497 --> 09:42.097
and Beth here is a junior...

09:42.098 --> 09:43.732
that it would be best if, you know, we..

09:43.733 --> 09:46.602
So if I were to call your aunt right now...

09:46.603 --> 09:49.004
she'd say the two of you are living with her?

09:49.005 --> 09:51.440
- Such would be the case.
- We cannot tell a lie.

09:52.742 --> 09:53.710
Your grades...

09:56.012 --> 09:57.207
are...

10:00.483 --> 10:01.314
excellent.

10:02.152 --> 10:05.487
Yeah, well, we actually both
speak four different languages...

10:05.488 --> 10:08.624
English, of course, French, Dutch...

10:08.625 --> 10:10.457
and something that
we made up when we were younger.

10:11.127 --> 10:12.261
Umgursta, Beth?

10:12.262 --> 10:14.959
Ain dach lostren vor, Sandra.

10:15.732 --> 10:17.600
- Inside joke.
- Well, wherever you live...

10:17.601 --> 10:20.799
Armstrong is always happy
to keep it's A" students. So...

10:22.005 --> 10:25.608
- I guess everything stays the same.
- Yay!

10:25.609 --> 10:27.109
On the path to greatness...

10:27.110 --> 10:30.746
one can't be afraid to draw
a little attention to oneself.

10:30.747 --> 10:34.083
So I'm like, why?
I mean, he's the psychiatrist.

10:34.084 --> 10:35.851
He's 12 years older than me.

10:35.852 --> 10:38.253
He got me pregnant,
and yet I'm being kicked out of group?

10:38.254 --> 10:40.255
I mean, isn't that what happened?

10:40.256 --> 10:43.726
Yeah, there was this whole big thing
with the APA. It was crazy.

10:43.727 --> 10:46.362
Exactly. So then I'm like, You know what?

10:46.363 --> 10:49.031
Do whatever you want, but I need privacy.

10:49.032 --> 10:51.228
Come on. Is any of that true?

10:52.369 --> 10:54.099
- Define true.
- Oh, my god.

11:03.246 --> 11:04.077
How was work?

11:04.748 --> 11:06.478
Oh, fine. You know...

11:07.984 --> 11:11.987
some doc thought
I messed up a blood draw, but...

11:11.988 --> 11:12.956
It'll get better.

11:13.256 --> 11:15.054
I got yo back, sistah.

11:16.259 --> 11:19.628
- Thanks for taking such good care of us.
- You're welcome.

11:19.629 --> 11:20.722
You're the best.

11:22.732 --> 11:23.866
Bye, Beth.

11:23.867 --> 11:26.368
I can't believe she's blowing off
Bobby's parent/teacher thing.

11:26.369 --> 11:28.504
She's not blowing it off, okay?

11:28.505 --> 11:30.506
I offered to go for her.

11:30.507 --> 11:32.141
Wait, what?

11:32.142 --> 11:35.110
- She has a shift.
- She wasn't even wearing her uniform.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.012
Yeah, I know.
She's getting changed there.

11:37.013 --> 11:38.480
And did you see how she looked?

11:38.481 --> 11:41.076
When has she ever gotten
all hoed up like that for work?

11:41.618 --> 11:42.851
So...

11:42.852 --> 11:44.486
given all that...

11:44.487 --> 11:47.990
he's quite a bit behind
the rest of the students in a few subjects.

11:47.991 --> 11:51.951
Yeah. You know, I'm not really comfortable...
putting Bobby on any drugs.

11:52.629 --> 11:55.497
Maybe this is a conversation
I should be having with your mother?

11:55.498 --> 11:57.933
I can assure you,
I'm going to be relaying all of this to her.

11:59.502 --> 12:00.595
You're drunk.

12:02.372 --> 12:03.972
Where's the bottle?

12:03.973 --> 12:07.705
- Oh, my god, Mom!
- No, don't take that! That's...

12:11.147 --> 12:13.148
Shit! You have an 8:00 shift this morning!

12:13.149 --> 12:15.243
No, I don't. It's too early.

12:15.752 --> 12:18.120
- It's 9:00.
- You weren't even working last night!

12:18.121 --> 12:21.216
Okay, you just missed Bobby's parent-teacher
thing so you could party!

12:23.727 --> 12:26.028
This is not okay!

12:26.029 --> 12:28.589
You have a family that needs you.

12:34.370 --> 12:36.805
- I guess I had a lapse.
- Yeah.

12:37.240 --> 12:40.509
You know, with the move and the new job...

12:40.510 --> 12:44.470
and I'm already fucking that up
and I'm fucking up the job.

12:45.014 --> 12:48.150
But I'm sorry and I'll try harder, I will...

12:48.151 --> 12:51.720
cause I'm lettin you down, aren't I?

12:51.721 --> 12:52.689
Again?

12:54.124 --> 12:55.092
It's okay, Mom.

12:55.492 --> 12:56.323
Come here.

12:56.960 --> 12:59.054
It's okay.

13:01.498 --> 13:02.329
Okay.

13:03.133 --> 13:04.328
Now...

13:06.603 --> 13:08.572
I know that this is gonna sound corny...

13:10.106 --> 13:11.233
but I believe in you.

13:13.109 --> 13:15.110
And I believe...

13:15.111 --> 13:16.602
that we can get through anything...

13:17.981 --> 13:18.812
together.

13:21.151 --> 13:22.483
Bobby, go back to your room.

13:23.620 --> 13:25.621
Well, if it isn't the hardest
working mom in show biz.

13:25.622 --> 13:28.390
Beth, go run her a bath, okay?
She has an 8:00 shift.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.087
Yeah, that's happening. What are you...?

13:32.028 --> 13:33.052
I'm sorry.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.054
It's okay.

13:53.483 --> 13:54.815
So...

13:56.853 --> 13:58.048
she had a lapse...

13:59.389 --> 14:00.357
but...

14:02.091 --> 14:03.492
she says she's gonna try harder.

14:03.493 --> 14:06.463
Well, if she said she's gonna try harder, then...

14:12.135 --> 14:13.869
We've been through this so many times.

14:13.870 --> 14:16.101
I know. I know.

14:17.006 --> 14:19.202
I can't fool myself any more.

14:27.984 --> 14:29.111
Bad stuff is coming.

14:29.752 --> 14:30.720
It's okay.

15:03.253 --> 15:04.448
How's your dad doin'?

15:06.022 --> 15:09.117
I remember he used to drive carpool
in second grade.

15:10.860 --> 15:12.351
Always listened to Guns n Roses.

15:13.129 --> 15:17.089
Yeah, well... he's alive and well and
living with his preferred family, so...

15:18.268 --> 15:19.135
But enough about me.

15:19.136 --> 15:22.697
I wanna know more about this Dark Lord
thing that you're going through.

15:27.010 --> 15:28.034
I don't know.

15:28.978 --> 15:33.211
It's like one day, I realized that I wasn't
who I was because I decided to be that way.

15:34.250 --> 15:36.947
You know?
Like I was just falling into step or something.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.346
So out came the eyeliner?

15:43.726 --> 15:45.494
It's better than being like everyone else.

15:45.495 --> 15:46.929
Yeah, you got that right.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.560
You know my pathetic father
always wanted to be an architect?

15:54.971 --> 15:57.105
Yeah, he still does. I mean...

15:57.106 --> 15:58.938
he still talks about it and everything.

16:00.510 --> 16:02.978
But he never did anything about it.

16:02.979 --> 16:04.208
He never even tried.

16:07.150 --> 16:10.086
Now he's just another office drone on Paxil.

16:14.023 --> 16:15.457
Do you really think it's that easy?

16:17.260 --> 16:18.956
Changing your whole life like that?

16:22.098 --> 16:23.088
Whatever.

16:25.101 --> 16:27.093
Look, bottom line,
if you don't like how things are...

16:28.604 --> 16:30.197
do something to make them better.

16:33.109 --> 16:34.475
Okay.

16:35.845 --> 16:38.847
I am going to get another lemonade, so...

16:38.848 --> 16:40.578
I'm guessing you want something stronger?

16:41.084 --> 16:42.211
I'm good.

17:12.015 --> 17:13.950
- Hi.
- Hey.

17:15.984 --> 17:19.478
Aren't you that chick that hooked up with her...

17:22.258 --> 17:23.089
therapist?

17:24.027 --> 17:26.028
You see, I wouldn't really call it a "hookup."

17:26.029 --> 17:29.056
I mean,
we were together for like six months, so...

17:31.734 --> 17:36.104
I want to buy you a beer.

17:37.507 --> 17:40.602
Thank you, but you know, bun in the oven, so...

17:41.511 --> 17:44.845
- Oh, right. Totally.
- Bye.

18:01.964 --> 18:04.266
Look, I don't know what your deal is...

18:04.267 --> 18:07.369
but you can't just dye your hair blue,
dress like a slutbag...

18:07.370 --> 18:10.105
and expect to be the shit all of a sudden.

18:10.106 --> 18:12.234
- It doesn't work that way.
- Doesn't it, though?

18:14.243 --> 18:15.802
I know you too well, Sandra.

18:16.846 --> 18:18.980
I'm not buying your bullshit pregnancy story.

18:18.981 --> 18:21.616
Okay, you know what, Ashley?
You know what?

18:21.617 --> 18:24.619
Our whole lives you've been prettier
than me and richer than me.

18:24.620 --> 18:26.121
I mean, look at your house!

18:26.122 --> 18:28.256
You have two parents
who treat you like a princess...

18:28.257 --> 18:30.625
you have a little brother
who doesn't think that you're his mother...

18:30.626 --> 18:32.961
and you don't move
to a crappier place every year.

18:32.962 --> 18:34.328
So you know what? Just...

18:38.501 --> 18:39.469
I'm listening.

18:41.003 --> 18:42.198
All I really wanted this year...

18:43.139 --> 18:45.699
was for guys to look at me.

18:46.242 --> 18:47.335
I can drink to that.

18:48.744 --> 18:49.712
Awesome!

18:50.146 --> 18:53.748
Well, it looks like you
and Ashley are new BFF's.

18:53.749 --> 18:57.385
I guess so. And I am pleased as punch...

18:57.386 --> 19:00.481
that you are not totally frickin
depressed for a change.

19:03.092 --> 19:04.726
I mean, admit it.

19:04.727 --> 19:08.459
Admit it, you had something
resembling a good time. Just say it.

19:09.265 --> 19:11.600
I thought it was pretty snazzy.

19:11.601 --> 19:13.368
- Snazzy?
- Snazzy.

19:13.369 --> 19:15.103
- Well!
- I did.

19:15.104 --> 19:19.940
New house, new year. My sister's in love.

19:25.848 --> 19:27.149
Oh, my god!

19:27.150 --> 19:31.086
Oh, my god.
Seriously, Mom? It's a school night.

19:31.087 --> 19:33.722
Come on, Bobby, put that down.
Put that down.

19:33.723 --> 19:35.624
Come on. Let's go to bed.

19:35.625 --> 19:37.457
Gee, Mom, are you loaded again?

19:42.865 --> 19:45.133
I'm sorry. I'm a shitty mom.

19:45.134 --> 19:47.069
Oh, god.

19:49.739 --> 19:50.839
Mom?

19:50.840 --> 19:53.141
Mom? Mom, why is the door locked?

19:53.142 --> 19:55.702
Mom, open the door! Mom!

19:59.081 --> 20:01.016
Oh, my god, Mom! Mom!

20:01.017 --> 20:04.112
Mom, no! Stop! What are you doing?

20:04.987 --> 20:07.856
No, no, no. Please don't do this.

20:07.857 --> 20:10.025
It's gonna be okay. Okay, please?

20:10.026 --> 20:13.028
Please. I'm sorry, I'll do better. Please.

20:13.029 --> 20:16.131
Don't go blaming yourself, kiddo.

20:16.132 --> 20:20.368
You've been everything a mother
could hope for in a daughter.

20:20.369 --> 20:22.737
It's just her time.

20:22.738 --> 20:23.330
No!

20:24.373 --> 20:27.842
Why not?
You'd be so much better off without me.

20:27.843 --> 20:29.511
No, that's not true.

20:29.512 --> 20:31.479
- It's true.
- No, it's not.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.675
I'm sorry.

20:33.249 --> 20:36.083
It's gonna be okay, okay?
We're gonna do better.

20:49.031 --> 20:51.967
I've never seen anyone
do anything like that before.

20:52.268 --> 20:54.736
You've never seen anyone
say grace before a meal?

20:54.737 --> 20:59.072
Our cousins life experiencedoesn't extend
much past the marijuana cloud in his bedroom.

21:00.376 --> 21:02.143
Really? That's great.

21:02.144 --> 21:03.845
You know what, Sandra?
You're a really good person.

21:03.846 --> 21:06.147
I was the one
who wanted to bring him back to the pound...

21:06.148 --> 21:08.383
- but then, you know.
- No, I mean, seriously.

21:08.384 --> 21:09.579
I think it's very...

21:11.387 --> 21:12.988
- attractive.
- Attractive?

21:12.989 --> 21:14.489
Seriously, Grandpa?

21:14.490 --> 21:17.726
Shut up, okay?
He obviously has a keen eye for beauty.

21:17.727 --> 21:19.728
Dude, this Jew and his dad...

21:19.729 --> 21:22.563
always said like Hebrew shit
before he drank wine.

21:24.600 --> 21:25.693
Hey, everybody.

21:26.602 --> 21:27.433
A toast.

21:28.371 --> 21:29.566
Happy Thanksgiving.

21:31.107 --> 21:33.375
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
It's bad luck to toast with water.

21:33.376 --> 21:34.571
So here, here.

21:35.611 --> 21:37.045
No, I can't have that.

21:38.080 --> 21:40.049
Oh, just pretend.

21:41.384 --> 21:42.984
Anyway...

21:42.985 --> 21:46.388
I just wanted to say
to everybody here that I am...

21:46.389 --> 21:48.123
on this special day...

21:48.124 --> 21:51.860
so grateful that you're all in my life...

21:51.861 --> 21:53.830
and in my wonderful childrens' life.

21:55.097 --> 21:57.732
- Cheers.
- This is lovely.

21:57.733 --> 21:58.826
So fabulous.

22:00.136 --> 22:02.103
Gosh, I wasn't gonna...

22:02.104 --> 22:04.139
I wasn't gonna bring this up tonight, but...

22:04.140 --> 22:06.109
since you guys are my rock...

22:07.376 --> 22:11.479
I lost my job. I was laid off.

22:11.480 --> 22:12.914
There were layoffs at the hospital.

22:14.984 --> 22:16.111
Oh, sweetheart.

22:17.253 --> 22:19.120
I'm so sorry.

22:19.121 --> 22:22.857
These big corporations think
they can do whatever they want.

22:22.858 --> 22:24.726
You know, I know a good labor lawyer.

22:24.727 --> 22:26.127
Oh, you do, absolutely.

22:26.128 --> 22:28.461
Oh, that's okay, Sheila, you know...

22:28.964 --> 22:29.964
I'll be fine. Because you know what?

22:29.965 --> 22:32.100
My new boyfriend, he's a lawyer...

22:32.101 --> 22:35.103
and so if I have some kind of case,
I'm sure hell tell me.

22:35.104 --> 22:36.604
Lawyer boyfriend? Really?

22:36.605 --> 22:38.239
Yeah, the kids haven't met him yet.

22:38.240 --> 22:41.609
Oh, wow.
You know, you're always so positive, Linda.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.378
You are a survivor.

22:43.379 --> 22:45.146
You always find a way.

22:45.147 --> 22:47.615
Yeah. I try.

22:47.616 --> 22:51.119
But with the expenses of moving
in and everything...

22:51.120 --> 22:54.489
this month, I'm just a little short.

22:54.490 --> 22:58.626
And I was just hoping
that maybe just for a month or two...

22:58.627 --> 23:01.461
and I could pay you back with interest.

23:06.602 --> 23:07.695
Lchaim!

23:08.504 --> 23:09.335
That was it.

23:10.740 --> 23:11.935
Lchaim!

23:14.844 --> 23:16.745
- Derek, where are you going?
- Out.

23:16.746 --> 23:18.747
- All right. Drive safely now.
- Bye.

23:18.748 --> 23:21.383
- Bye, honey. Drive safely.
- Okay.

23:21.384 --> 23:23.618
Sweethearts, I want you to know...

23:23.619 --> 23:25.720
that I'd help out if I could, but...

23:25.721 --> 23:28.623
we just bought the house and
I'm a little cash poor at the moment.

23:28.624 --> 23:30.859
- Okay? Okay.
- We understand.

23:30.860 --> 23:34.456
You know, it was exactly the same for us
when we got the new summer home.

23:34.730 --> 23:37.132
Will you do something about her?
Bye, I love you.

23:37.133 --> 23:38.100
- I love you, too.
- Love you.

23:38.101 --> 23:40.268
- Love you.
- See you later. Take care of your mama.

23:40.269 --> 23:41.703
Take care of your house.

23:43.372 --> 23:44.739
That was a good Thanksgiving, sweetie.

23:44.740 --> 23:46.007
Thank you so much.

23:46.008 --> 23:48.102
You know you could if you wanted to.

23:49.378 --> 23:51.074
How many more times, Linda?

23:52.148 --> 23:54.083
How many more?

23:55.384 --> 23:56.352
I love you.

24:03.492 --> 24:04.492
Hey...

24:04.493 --> 24:07.629
I told my mom to go on without me.

24:07.630 --> 24:09.223
- You wanna go for a walk?
- Let's go.

24:42.131 --> 24:43.929
Now it's a normal Thanksgiving.

24:45.868 --> 24:49.828
So, you guys are having like,
money trouble?

24:52.374 --> 24:53.933
Can you call me attractive again?

24:55.110 --> 24:56.611
What?

24:56.612 --> 24:58.808
You know, like you said before.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.341
I don't know, I just like hearing you say it.

25:03.085 --> 25:04.212
Well, you are.

25:05.087 --> 25:08.683
You're very attractive.

25:09.625 --> 25:10.820
You are hysterical.

25:14.096 --> 25:15.928
You know, I know Beth thinks I'm a loser...

25:17.500 --> 25:19.833
because I don't dress like a vampire
or whatever...

25:20.736 --> 25:21.567
but...

25:23.138 --> 25:24.936
I think you're a really good person.

25:27.243 --> 25:30.378
I mean, you'd do anything
for the people you love, and I think that's...

25:30.379 --> 25:33.213
I think that's rare.

25:34.750 --> 25:35.718
Look...

25:38.854 --> 25:42.490
I've had feelings for you since we were, like...

25:42.491 --> 25:45.586
little kids,
since our mom's started working together.

25:46.128 --> 25:48.222
Yeah. I know.

25:50.032 --> 25:51.125
You do?

25:51.867 --> 25:53.597
Yeah. I mean, I'm not retarded.

25:55.137 --> 25:57.106
So like, why didn't you ever say anything?

25:58.007 --> 26:00.108
I don't know.

26:00.109 --> 26:03.102
I guess I just always liked
the idea of having a smart...

26:03.846 --> 26:06.941
good-looking, older man pining after me.

26:09.251 --> 26:11.119
Oh, Davey...

26:11.120 --> 26:15.623
it's not like I didn't have feelings
for you back or anything...

26:15.624 --> 26:16.717
it's just...

26:17.493 --> 26:18.461
listen...

26:19.094 --> 26:21.325
you don't want to get involved
with someone like me.

26:21.730 --> 26:22.823
Okay?

26:23.966 --> 26:25.867
Come on, don't give me that.

26:25.868 --> 26:28.736
I've known you since like forever.
I know who you really are.

26:28.737 --> 26:32.740
And now I'm away at school now...

26:32.741 --> 26:34.742
and this could be our last chance to,
you know..

26:34.743 --> 26:36.575
The long distance thing is really rough.

26:38.614 --> 26:41.345
Yeah, but you know,
I'm willing to give it a go.

26:43.619 --> 26:47.388
First, you have to think of 10 words
to describe my beauty.

26:47.389 --> 26:49.221
Other than "attractive."

26:51.727 --> 26:52.922
Okay...

26:56.365 --> 26:57.999
you're...

26:58.000 --> 27:00.368
you're beautiful...

27:00.369 --> 27:01.803
- Okay.
- You're...

27:04.506 --> 27:05.599
gorgeous...

27:06.609 --> 27:07.577
you're...

27:08.844 --> 27:09.812
lovely...

27:12.014 --> 27:14.347
cute. I don't know, handsome?

27:19.722 --> 27:21.315
Can I kiss you now?

27:23.726 --> 27:25.058
Oh, look, a dead bird.

27:34.870 --> 27:35.838
Hi.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.809
How was your walk with David?

27:40.109 --> 27:42.840
He didn't try to hold your hand, did he?

27:43.245 --> 27:44.804
He is...

27:45.381 --> 27:46.576
very sweet.

27:47.016 --> 27:51.252
And I'm just not quite sure
what to do with that, so...

27:51.253 --> 27:52.387
Oh, well.

27:52.388 --> 27:55.119
Anyways, I've been brushing up
on my Residential Tenancies Act.

27:56.258 --> 27:58.359
Once we miss rent and
the landlord starts the process...

27:58.360 --> 28:00.192
we've got another six weeks or so.

28:00.963 --> 28:05.099
Which means well be evicted mid-January...
just in time for my birthday.

28:05.100 --> 28:11.139
Well... I hate to destroy your smug,
know-it-all sense of self, Beth, but...

28:11.140 --> 28:16.978
I actually overheard Mom on the phone...
with her mysterious lawyer-boyfriend and...

28:16.979 --> 28:19.614
it kinda sounded like
he was willing to help out with the rent.

28:19.615 --> 28:22.617
- Wow, Lawyer Boyfriend is real?
- Evidently.

28:22.618 --> 28:25.119
I didn't realize Mom
could still fuck above her pay grade.

28:25.120 --> 28:28.454
Well, she can and he's apparently quite
a bit older than her.

28:34.096 --> 28:35.863
I would like to offer you...

28:35.864 --> 28:37.833
this brownie.

28:39.001 --> 28:41.027
Me and your mother are going to dinner.

28:41.603 --> 28:42.870
She baked you a brownie.

28:42.871 --> 28:45.740
- I did, I baked you a brownie.
- All day, she was slaving.

28:45.741 --> 28:48.376
All of these brownies I baked for you.

28:48.377 --> 28:51.575
- Just take a bite. And it's...
- Okay, I'll take a bite. Kay.

28:54.083 --> 28:55.676
Yummy.

28:58.120 --> 29:00.453
- I like him.
- Do you?

29:12.267 --> 29:13.235
Mornin.

29:16.138 --> 29:18.334
Which one are you? Sandra or Beth?

29:21.143 --> 29:23.840
I'm the one you should let go of. Please.

29:25.748 --> 29:27.114
What's wrong with you? Cmon.

29:28.083 --> 29:30.084
- Let go of me!
- Hey, hey.

29:30.085 --> 29:32.620
I'm trying to talk to you.
What's wrong with you, huh?

29:32.621 --> 29:33.953
Calm down.

29:38.494 --> 29:40.827
Why do you wear so much make-up?

29:42.030 --> 29:44.732
Pretty girl, you shouldn't cover your face.

29:44.733 --> 29:46.702
You look like a fucking vampire.

29:48.137 --> 29:51.839
- Please, Steve.
- Come on, come on. Calm down.

29:51.840 --> 29:54.935
Calm down.

30:22.504 --> 30:24.097
Do another what if.

30:24.973 --> 30:26.100
What happened?

30:28.110 --> 30:30.477
Make me feel better.

30:32.247 --> 30:33.078
Now.

30:33.749 --> 30:36.241
Okay, okay. Okay.

30:37.486 --> 30:41.582
Okay, what if we were...
like Bonnie and Clyde?

30:42.624 --> 30:45.092
- You know, and we ran away..
- No, no.

30:45.093 --> 30:48.095
I wanna do a happy one. Please.

30:48.096 --> 30:51.464
A happy one, okay. Okay.

30:52.601 --> 30:56.561
Okay, what if...

30:57.105 --> 30:58.095
oh, okay, okay.

30:59.141 --> 31:00.575
Okay, remember...

31:01.009 --> 31:03.103
that trip that we took to the lake...

31:04.513 --> 31:07.608
right before Mom and Doug broke up?

31:09.017 --> 31:10.952
You know, with Bobby and everybody?

31:11.987 --> 31:13.478
That was fun.

31:47.990 --> 31:48.958
As if.

31:56.865 --> 31:57.958
A toast...

31:58.133 --> 32:01.269
to family in all it's wonderful forms.

32:01.270 --> 32:02.737
And...

32:02.738 --> 32:05.833
to finally having a real man around the house.

32:11.613 --> 32:12.808
Merry Christmas.

32:15.150 --> 32:16.584
What's the words?

32:27.029 --> 32:28.588
Here, let me dance, let me dance.

32:42.844 --> 32:44.073
Happy New Year!

32:44.613 --> 32:45.808
My girls!

32:54.122 --> 32:55.389
Wanna go to bed?

32:55.390 --> 32:57.625
No, the ball hasn't dropped yet.

32:57.626 --> 32:59.060
It has, actually.

33:00.963 --> 33:02.454
Stop, Mom, stop. Stop.

33:05.867 --> 33:07.836
- Hey, sweetie.
- Get the fuck off me!

33:15.243 --> 33:16.610
How many Valentines did you get?

33:16.611 --> 33:19.103
- Which one is your girlfriend?
- Can I have all the candy now?

33:20.983 --> 33:21.814
Mom!

33:22.985 --> 33:23.953
Mom!

33:24.252 --> 33:27.450
Oh, my god. Come on, Bobby,
let's start your homework.

33:28.991 --> 33:30.357
Jesus Christ.

33:38.967 --> 33:40.501
So, Mom...

33:40.502 --> 33:45.338
I was wondering if I could have
some friends over if that's okay.

33:59.121 --> 34:01.317
- What?
- You only gave me three.

34:02.090 --> 34:04.321
Here's two more.
All right, let's go. We're all in.

34:10.032 --> 34:12.058
Hey, where's the little guy tonight?

34:12.734 --> 34:15.136
With his asshole father.

34:15.137 --> 34:17.505
Such an asshole.

34:17.505 --> 34:20.141
I know, Bobby's a goddamn handful...

34:20.141 --> 34:24.245
but the best part of having kids
is making em, right? Right, Steve?

34:24.246 --> 34:26.579
- Yep.
- Right, Stevie?

34:27.849 --> 34:29.943
I love it here.

34:33.722 --> 34:34.989
Now let's play cards, huh?

34:34.989 --> 34:37.725
- We love having you here, Ainsley.
- Ainsley?

34:37.726 --> 34:41.027
- Mom. It's Ashley.
- You in?

34:41.029 --> 34:43.130
- Sorry.
- All right, let's go. Come on.

34:43.130 --> 34:44.998
- I thought Ainsley was pretty.
- You in?

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
- Yeah, yeah.
- Let's go.

34:46.001 --> 34:48.601
Anyway, I think you will appreciate this...

34:48.603 --> 34:51.505
because you are a woman
and I can see in your eyes...

34:51.505 --> 34:54.842
- you have that look in your eyes.
- Thank you.

34:54.842 --> 34:58.379
Steve here really knows
how to make a girl feel good.

34:58.380 --> 34:59.247
You know, down there.

34:59.248 --> 35:00.748
- You know what I'm sayin, right?
- Mom!

35:00.749 --> 35:04.151
- No, Mom! Mom! Mom!
- Like five times in a row!

35:04.152 --> 35:05.120
Are you in or out?

35:05.987 --> 35:08.022
- I'm out.
- You in?

35:08.023 --> 35:10.491
- Yes. I'm in.
- Could you pass me that? Thanks.

35:10.492 --> 35:13.727
I don't know if I can be in or out.
You have to tell me.

35:13.728 --> 35:15.262
Don't show me your cards.

35:15.263 --> 35:17.364
- I don't know what to do.
- All right, you're out then.

35:17.365 --> 35:20.000
- Okay.
- What do you got? You in or out?

35:20.001 --> 35:21.560
I'm in.

35:22.737 --> 35:23.705
Beth?

35:25.740 --> 35:26.708
Beth.

35:32.614 --> 35:33.707
I'm out.

35:36.151 --> 35:39.487
Come on, Steve, let's go to bed.
Come on, let's just go in the bedroom.

35:39.488 --> 35:42.925
Come on. Come on.
Come on, come on, come on!

35:43.492 --> 35:44.460
Great!

35:45.961 --> 35:50.695
- Get off!
- Jesus Christ! I hate this game!

35:51.032 --> 35:52.125
I'm sorry.

35:56.371 --> 35:58.506
Mom, just go to bed, please!

35:58.507 --> 36:01.102
- Just go. Go to bed.
- Okay.

36:02.010 --> 36:03.103
Just go.

36:05.380 --> 36:06.847
Oh, my gosh!

36:06.848 --> 36:12.253
You know, I hate to repeat myself,
but your mom is awesome.

36:12.254 --> 36:14.086
- Thanks, Ash.
- Steve!

36:15.123 --> 36:17.456
- Hey.
- What?

36:17.859 --> 36:20.494
Listen, my dad keeps a chainsaw
in the garage...

36:20.495 --> 36:24.091
says it'll cut through anything.
A tree, a wall, a mother.

36:24.966 --> 36:27.333
- How about a mother's boyfriend?
- Why not?

36:29.271 --> 36:32.969
She's drinking again.
I mean, she's barely functional.

36:33.508 --> 36:35.841
- She lost her job, and this new guy..
- Whoa, wait, let's go back.

36:36.611 --> 36:38.705
When was your mother diagnosed an alcoholic?

36:40.849 --> 36:42.249
Never, I guess.

36:42.250 --> 36:44.485
She went to a meeting
a couple of years ago once...

36:44.486 --> 36:47.320
but she said the whole thing wasn't for her.

36:47.989 --> 36:52.085
And have you guys experienced
any physical or sexual abuse?

36:53.261 --> 36:55.355
Well, nothing worth mentioning at this point...

36:56.498 --> 36:57.830
Is your mom being abused?

36:58.600 --> 37:00.501
Well, no, not yet.

37:00.502 --> 37:02.102
But, I mean, we've been here before.

37:02.103 --> 37:04.505
I mean, we need like a preemptive
strike or something.

37:04.506 --> 37:05.839
Look, I believe you.

37:05.840 --> 37:09.143
But without a record of abuse or alcoholism...

37:09.144 --> 37:12.842
you're just gonna sound like a couple of kids...
that don't like their moms new boyfriend.

37:13.248 --> 37:15.616
Now you've got to document everything.

37:15.617 --> 37:18.852
How much she drinks, any signs of neglect...

37:18.853 --> 37:21.448
inappropriate behavior
on the part of the boyfriend.

37:22.490 --> 37:24.725
And then maybe we can reconnect..

37:24.726 --> 37:25.694
What'd she say?

37:26.361 --> 37:29.195
By the time they do anything,
I'll be the alcoholic neglecting my kids.

37:31.499 --> 37:32.467
Shit.

37:35.737 --> 37:37.831
Dad, we wanted to talk to you
about something serious.

37:41.142 --> 37:42.337
Mom's drinking again.

37:43.612 --> 37:44.807
Again or still?

37:45.380 --> 37:47.481
Again. She stopped for a while, but...

37:47.482 --> 37:49.016
now she's off the wagon and...

37:49.017 --> 37:51.719
I don't have any legal rights here.
Your mother has full custody.

37:51.720 --> 37:54.212
We're still your daughters.
We need your help.

37:55.123 --> 37:57.058
Don't throw that at me.

37:58.093 --> 38:00.094
In the beginning, you two wouldn't
even take your visits with me...

38:00.095 --> 38:03.030
and now, the only time I hear
from you is when you need money.

38:03.031 --> 38:05.366
Come on, Dad.
I mean, we were little then.

38:05.367 --> 38:07.134
I mean, how were we supposed
to know what was going on?

38:07.135 --> 38:09.970
And really, when's the last time
that we ever asked you for money?

38:09.971 --> 38:11.803
- Like seriously?
- Okay.

38:12.974 --> 38:14.203
That was uncalled for.

38:17.846 --> 38:19.041
I could talk to your mom...

38:20.148 --> 38:22.583
but we all know
I'm the last person she'd listen to.

38:25.387 --> 38:27.822
- We can't live there anymore, Dad.
- It's not that simple.

38:29.391 --> 38:31.087
I have another family now.

38:32.260 --> 38:36.030
She's my sister, girls.
And if I've ever been sure of anything...

38:36.031 --> 38:37.965
I'm sure that she loves you.

38:37.966 --> 38:40.000
Yeah, that doesn't really
have anything with love.

38:40.001 --> 38:42.603
You need to give her more time.

38:42.604 --> 38:46.006
You just moved, and she just lost her job.

38:46.007 --> 38:47.805
That's a lot of stress.

38:48.610 --> 38:53.207
And what she needs now
is your patience and your support.

38:54.149 --> 38:55.947
Okay.

38:58.987 --> 39:00.353
Okay. Come on.

39:13.501 --> 39:14.332
Mom.

39:16.104 --> 39:17.094
Look at me. Look at me.

39:17.739 --> 39:20.072
Why are you letting this happen?

39:22.844 --> 39:24.437
I'm doing it for you.

39:38.626 --> 39:40.117
Don't you have school today?

39:41.096 --> 39:43.463
- It's reading week.
- It's what?

39:44.632 --> 39:46.726
I said it's reading week.

39:48.269 --> 39:50.966
- Asshole.
- Don't be a little snotnose!

39:51.606 --> 39:54.576
What are you gonna do, huh?
What are you gonna do?

39:55.844 --> 39:56.977
Let me tell you something.

39:56.978 --> 39:59.573
You and your sister better
change your attitude around here.

40:00.014 --> 40:02.711
Cause let me explain the situation to you.

40:03.251 --> 40:04.685
Without me...

40:04.986 --> 40:08.946
you, your sister, and your little brother
are out in the fuckin street.

40:09.724 --> 40:12.126
Out! Out of my fucking house!

40:12.127 --> 40:13.727
You fucking asshole! You get out!

40:13.728 --> 40:16.096
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey! Hey! Listen to me!

40:16.097 --> 40:18.966
Don't ever touch my sister
or my mother again, you fucker!

40:18.967 --> 40:20.697
You get out of here! No!

40:22.003 --> 40:24.872
- Beth! No, baby, wait.
- No!

40:24.873 --> 40:26.466
Wait. Wait.

40:31.746 --> 40:33.112
Beth, he's hitting her.

40:35.250 --> 40:37.219
I saw bruises all over her body.

40:39.988 --> 40:42.219
So, I think...

40:44.259 --> 40:45.818
I mean, what's left?

40:47.128 --> 40:49.063
Are we gonna run away?

40:50.265 --> 40:52.063
I don't know what to do anymore.

40:57.605 --> 41:00.007
God, you know what? I'm so sick of this.

41:00.008 --> 41:04.144
I am, I'm so tired of
her dragging us down all the time.

41:04.145 --> 41:07.381
I mean, look at us!
We're beautiful, talented...

41:07.382 --> 41:08.749
and we have so much potential.

41:08.750 --> 41:11.485
I mean, I'm gonna be
this amazing actor and doctor...

41:11.486 --> 41:16.089
and you're gonna do amazing things
and be really, really rich.

41:16.090 --> 41:18.492
And I don't know, I'm just...

41:18.493 --> 41:23.630
I'm so tired of wasting
our time trying to survive.

41:23.631 --> 41:26.123
You know? Helping her survive.

41:29.003 --> 41:32.098
I mean, what if we could...

41:38.379 --> 41:39.347
Hi, girls.

41:45.854 --> 41:48.346
You've both been through so much.

41:49.491 --> 41:54.054
And you've taken care of each other
and of your little brother.

41:54.496 --> 41:56.089
And I'm so proud of you.

42:03.738 --> 42:05.570
I have a little present for you both.

42:06.107 --> 42:07.075
What is it?

42:07.242 --> 42:08.210
Oh, shit!

42:10.111 --> 42:11.101
I'll be right back.

42:13.748 --> 42:16.115
Oh, Linda!

42:18.720 --> 42:19.688
What if...?

42:21.256 --> 42:22.349
Seriously?

42:37.739 --> 42:39.105
So I hear you and Donny broke up.

42:40.241 --> 42:41.608
Yeah, it's amicable.

42:41.609 --> 42:43.510
I'm gonna see if hell give me
some sort of settlement.

42:43.511 --> 42:44.945
Maybe his Escalade.

42:48.249 --> 42:49.581
Are you guys talking about me?

42:50.251 --> 42:52.948
Duh, Ashley, 'cause all
we ever do is talk about you.

42:56.391 --> 42:57.825
Donny really is loaded, huh?

43:00.261 --> 43:03.823
You know, there might be a way that Sandra
and me could get our hands on that kind of cash.

43:04.032 --> 43:06.366
All I'm saying is,
if our mom were to die somehow...

43:06.367 --> 43:09.701
we would get about $100,000
in insurance money.

43:10.371 --> 43:12.704
- I looked it up.
- Where did you look it up?

43:13.741 --> 43:15.976
I found her policy number,
checked the terms online.

43:15.977 --> 43:18.245
Yeah, and we might even be able
to still live in our house.

43:18.246 --> 43:21.615
You know, were both over 16,
so we could all live together.

43:21.616 --> 43:23.150
You know, be one big happy family.

43:23.151 --> 43:26.253
But if we were sent to a relative,
it'd be Aunt Martha...

43:26.254 --> 43:28.855
- who's loaded, which is a good thing.
- Yeah.

43:28.856 --> 43:30.390
And what about Bobby?

43:30.391 --> 43:33.093
Well, Bobby'd be sent to live with his dad,
but that's what Bobby wants...

43:33.094 --> 43:34.962
and remember...

43:34.963 --> 43:36.329
Doug never hit Bobby.

43:37.131 --> 43:38.099
Only Mom.

43:45.840 --> 43:46.671
Come here.

43:47.976 --> 43:50.207
You're not seriously talking about
killing your mom for money?

43:51.245 --> 43:54.081
No, but even if I was...

43:54.082 --> 43:55.573
it wouldn't be just about the money.

43:56.985 --> 44:00.080
It would be because our lives aren't
gonna get any better with her in them.

44:02.090 --> 44:05.060
Come on. I'm just messing with you.
I wanna play.

44:17.972 --> 44:21.241
- You are one twisted bitch.
- Thank you.

44:21.242 --> 44:23.010
So, how would you do it?

44:23.011 --> 44:25.446
You know,
if you were really going to kill her?

44:36.991 --> 44:40.627
It says here we don't get
any insurance money for suicide.

44:40.628 --> 44:42.824
And you guys don't have a garage, either.

44:53.741 --> 44:56.233
Stairs? Statistically
it's kind of a stretch.

44:57.512 --> 44:58.707
You can't be sure she'll be dead.

45:30.511 --> 45:31.479
You know...

45:33.014 --> 45:34.107
the way you gotta do it...

45:35.483 --> 45:37.918
is to get her plastered...

45:38.152 --> 45:39.711
and make her take a bath...

45:41.122 --> 45:43.318
and make it look like she drowned.

45:49.097 --> 45:49.928
Yeah.

45:53.367 --> 45:55.736
I don't think Bobby would mind
if we made it into like a..

45:55.737 --> 45:57.604
- Well, one of them should have..
- What's he doing here?

45:57.605 --> 45:58.698
Hi, honey.

46:00.374 --> 46:01.569
Hey, sweetheart.

46:02.744 --> 46:03.837
Why aren't you drunk?

46:04.612 --> 46:05.612
Did we run out of money?

46:05.613 --> 46:07.748
Ha-ha. Very funny.

46:07.749 --> 46:10.947
All right, girls, come sit down.
We need to talk to you about something.

46:12.019 --> 46:13.578
Sit down.

46:25.266 --> 46:26.461
So...

46:27.735 --> 46:30.830
what do you guys think of mine
and Steve's relationship so far?

46:33.975 --> 46:36.103
I don't think I understand the question.

46:37.845 --> 46:39.939
Well...

46:41.015 --> 46:43.617
things are getting pretty serious and...

46:43.618 --> 46:46.452
Steve thinks it's for the best
that we all move in together.

46:47.388 --> 46:48.583
So wait.

46:50.091 --> 46:51.491
He's moving in here?

46:51.492 --> 46:55.028
No, we, me and your mother
discussed that maybe...

46:55.029 --> 46:58.591
it'd be best for everyone
if you all moved into my place.

46:59.267 --> 47:00.963
It's larger...

47:01.869 --> 47:04.703
both you girls would have your own rooms,
more privacy.

47:05.973 --> 47:07.202
I think you'd like it there.

47:10.144 --> 47:11.237
What do you think?

47:12.613 --> 47:14.707
I bathe you, for fucks sake.

47:16.083 --> 47:17.851
I see the bruises that he gives you...

47:17.852 --> 47:20.086
and I know that you see the looks
that he gives Beth, and it's..

47:20.087 --> 47:21.488
- Sandra.
- No!

47:21.489 --> 47:24.858
I don't know what you're telling
yourself is happening here.

47:24.859 --> 47:28.819
And how can you be
so fucking pathetic all the time?!

47:38.005 --> 47:39.029
Hi.

47:42.844 --> 47:47.339
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but the guys got money.

47:48.249 --> 47:49.080
What?

47:49.483 --> 47:52.719
I know, but listen to me, okay?

47:52.720 --> 47:54.087
The way that were going...

47:54.088 --> 47:56.489
we're gonna be in a shelter in less than a month.

47:56.490 --> 47:58.725
- Okay, yeah, it's messed up.
- Wow.

47:58.726 --> 48:01.261
I'll have to maneuver around him...

48:01.262 --> 48:03.959
but it's better than being
on the street, Sandra, and...

48:05.266 --> 48:06.600
- Nope.
- I'll just, like, spend more time...

48:06.601 --> 48:08.001
- at Justins or something.
- Okay, but you say that...

48:08.002 --> 48:10.270
like it's no big deal, Beth. Okay?

48:10.271 --> 48:14.007
Do you honestly think that he's not gonna
catch you alone like once or twice?

48:14.008 --> 48:15.108
I'll deal.

48:15.109 --> 48:15.843
- You'll deal?
- Yes.

48:15.844 --> 48:18.612
Okay, you'll deal. But then what about me?

48:18.613 --> 48:20.847
Or Bobby? Or what about Mom?

48:20.848 --> 48:23.750
I mean, I'd rather kill her than watch
her let another guy treat her like this.

48:23.751 --> 48:27.020
First of all, that logic that
you have there is fucked. Okay?

48:27.021 --> 48:28.388
Who gives a shit about her anymore?

48:28.389 --> 48:31.258
- She clearly does not give a shit about us.
- No, you know what?

48:31.259 --> 48:33.493
Your attitude about this is
what's fucked, Beth.

48:33.494 --> 48:35.962
Okay? You're only thinking about yourself.

48:35.963 --> 48:37.631
Okay? You're being really selfish...

48:37.632 --> 48:40.124
and I'm trying to think about everybody,
including Mom.

48:40.968 --> 48:42.061
Fine, go.

48:44.138 --> 48:47.841
Death from suffocation, cerebral hypoxia...

48:47.842 --> 48:50.334
cardiac arrest.

48:51.245 --> 48:52.846
Okay, everyone.

48:52.847 --> 48:56.016
Basically, it doesn't matter...
how long a person's unconscious for.

48:56.017 --> 48:59.486
You know, as long as they're underwater
for four minutes, then they drown.

48:59.487 --> 49:01.721
Until then, they can still technically be alive.

49:01.722 --> 49:03.490
With a varying degree of brain damage.

49:03.491 --> 49:04.724
Yeah. Basically.

49:04.725 --> 49:06.126
Wait the full four minutes.

49:06.127 --> 49:08.495
I mean, the last thing you guys
need is a vegetable for a mom.

49:08.496 --> 49:10.497
Are you guys doing
your murderers club thing in here?

49:10.498 --> 49:11.631
Get out.

49:11.632 --> 49:12.725
Meow.

49:15.102 --> 49:19.096
Okay. So, beforehand...
we need to make sure that she's still conscious..

49:20.508 --> 49:21.476
Glee club meeting.

49:22.376 --> 49:24.572
Oh. Sorry about that.

49:25.846 --> 49:29.482
Like I said, beforehand we need
to make sure that she's still conscious.

49:29.483 --> 49:32.018
Kay? Because it's not like
we can carry her to the bathroom...

49:32.019 --> 49:33.351
so she needs to walk herself.

49:34.488 --> 49:36.856
You know, I can probably swipe
some of my mom's Tylenol with codeine...

49:36.857 --> 49:38.491
that she got when she had her back problem.

49:38.492 --> 49:41.326
Mixed with booze,
those things'll turn anyone into a puppet.

49:42.096 --> 49:45.632
Yeah, and I mean, even if she wakes up
and starts to fight back...

49:45.633 --> 49:46.866
we'll just stop, you know?

49:46.867 --> 49:48.460
It'll look like were helping her.

49:50.271 --> 49:52.372
And if her lungs fill up with enough water...

49:52.373 --> 49:53.974
she'll be dead in a day or two anyways.

49:53.975 --> 49:56.843
You know, I told, like,
my entire homeroom about our little club.

49:56.844 --> 49:58.845
Everyone thinks it's hysterical.

49:58.846 --> 50:01.381
Hey, I wonder if well get
an EC credit on our college apps.

50:01.382 --> 50:02.983
Oh, you think? Huh?

50:02.984 --> 50:04.484
Stop it! Okay, enough!

50:04.485 --> 50:07.216
I can't believe that you guys
aren't taking this seriously like at all!

50:09.623 --> 50:10.716
What's her damage?

50:14.028 --> 50:16.827
You went rather ape-shit
in the bathroom today.

50:18.099 --> 50:19.465
We were just screwing around.

50:20.968 --> 50:22.736
Yeah, well, that's fine.
I mean, you've got Justin now...

50:22.737 --> 50:24.706
so I guess you don't really need me that much.

50:26.841 --> 50:29.743
That is so stupid.
He's not replacing you or anything..

50:29.744 --> 50:32.145
You know, he kinda is, Beth, actually,
but you know what? It's fine.

50:32.146 --> 50:34.481
Let's just forget the whole thing
and you can take care of yourself...

50:34.482 --> 50:36.016
and I can take care of myself, okay?

50:36.017 --> 50:37.952
That'll be that.

50:39.720 --> 50:40.551
You're such a...

50:50.264 --> 50:52.599
I swear to God,
his eyes never looked at my face.

50:52.600 --> 50:55.092
Eew! Mr. Weinberg is such a perv!

51:47.021 --> 51:48.621
No, I don't.

51:48.622 --> 51:52.354
Can you keep it down here, please?

51:54.728 --> 51:56.822
- You beat me.
- I just feel a little tired.

51:58.132 --> 52:01.601
I'm paying rent here,
I'm paying rent on my place.

52:01.602 --> 52:04.800
- Do you think that's fair to me?
- I know, no, it's not fair.

52:10.010 --> 52:12.612
Hey, come on! Take it outta here, huh?

52:12.613 --> 52:15.811
But he won! You won, Bobby! You won!

52:16.484 --> 52:18.852
Goddamn it,
what the hell is wrong with you?!

52:18.853 --> 52:21.121
- For Christs sake!
- Get the fuck away from him!

52:21.122 --> 52:22.556
Jesus Christ!

52:25.092 --> 52:26.259
Hey! Hey!

52:26.260 --> 52:29.594
Enough of this!
I'm done with this goddamn place!

52:30.030 --> 52:32.829
- Are you okay?
- I'm outta here! I've had enough!

52:34.869 --> 52:37.737
- Are you okay, Bobby?
- You let him do this!

52:37.738 --> 52:39.832
Oh, my god.

52:42.243 --> 52:43.336
Steve?

52:45.379 --> 52:46.472
Steve?

52:47.848 --> 52:48.941
Steve?!

52:49.150 --> 52:51.346
Steve!

52:58.392 --> 52:59.826
It's okay, Bobby.

53:00.861 --> 53:02.227
Close your eyes.

53:08.602 --> 53:09.934
Okay, you were right.

53:10.604 --> 53:13.802
Just please tell me
what we can do to make this stop.

53:18.512 --> 53:19.480
Bobby...

53:20.247 --> 53:22.045
you're going to your dad's this weekend.

54:05.492 --> 54:07.085
Hey, shotgun! Now.

54:07.728 --> 54:12.462
I know, I know. It sucks to be you.
I'm sorry.

54:15.970 --> 54:21.102
Okay, okay, so I am entrusting you two to make
a reservation for 7:00 pm at Jack Russells, okay?

54:23.010 --> 54:25.845
Okay, okay.
And then we'll dump any excess pills...

54:25.846 --> 54:28.615
or any gloves into separate garbage
cans in the parking lot, okay?

54:28.616 --> 54:30.448
Oh, oh, and when we get home...

54:31.485 --> 54:33.386
I wanna be the one to make the 911 call.

54:33.387 --> 54:35.021
- Really?
- Someone needs to be crying...

54:35.022 --> 54:38.982
and as we all know,
I'm nothing short of a brilliant actress.

54:39.360 --> 54:41.961
- Yes, brilliant, darling, brilliant.
- Wait, wait.

54:41.962 --> 54:44.964
Guys, didn't we say we were
just screwing around with this stuff? I mean..

54:44.965 --> 54:48.197
Ashley, if you wanna pussy out,
now would be opportune.

54:54.742 --> 54:55.573
Whatever.

55:08.122 --> 55:09.090
Anybody see you?

55:10.090 --> 55:11.058
No.

55:11.125 --> 55:12.457
Okay, so...

55:14.862 --> 55:16.694
This is...

55:17.031 --> 55:18.465
this is really fucked.

55:20.734 --> 55:22.828
If you don't like your life,
you gotta do something to make it better, right?

55:23.871 --> 55:25.703
Isn't that what you told me?

55:27.741 --> 55:28.936
Yeah.

55:29.510 --> 55:30.478
So?

55:37.151 --> 55:39.484
It's okay. Don't worry.
Don't worry, it's okay.

55:45.492 --> 55:46.585
Be careful.

55:49.263 --> 55:50.356
I love you.

55:53.100 --> 55:54.068
I know.

55:55.602 --> 55:57.696
I love you, too, dipshit.

56:01.008 --> 56:05.244
I am off to go buy booze
with Ashley's allowance, so...

56:05.245 --> 56:06.679
how does my fake ID look?

56:09.383 --> 56:11.943
- Wendy Goldstein.
- Weren't you at my bat mitzvah?

56:12.853 --> 56:15.088
I'm sure I saw you there. Weren't you...?

56:15.089 --> 56:16.580
No? No?

56:22.963 --> 56:24.192
Now don't worry, okay?

56:25.499 --> 56:27.058
I am going to be fine.

56:42.015 --> 56:43.574
What are you doing up so early?

56:44.618 --> 56:46.712
I have a job interview.

56:47.488 --> 56:48.683
I wanna be on time.

56:51.392 --> 56:52.826
Hey, so...

56:54.862 --> 56:58.060
that was pretty crazy
the other night with Steve, huh?

57:01.101 --> 57:02.228
It won't happen again.

57:03.003 --> 57:04.096
You'll see.

57:06.106 --> 57:07.074
Yeah.

57:08.609 --> 57:10.441
Cause I've never heard that one before.

57:24.391 --> 57:26.025
- David.
- Hey. What's up?

57:26.026 --> 57:27.627
Hi. What are you doing here?

57:27.628 --> 57:29.961
I just got back from school.
I wanted to see you.

57:33.100 --> 57:35.501
Now's not really a good time.

57:35.502 --> 57:38.271
Why not? Is everything okay, or...?

57:38.272 --> 57:40.605
Yeah, no, everything's good.
It's just like...

57:42.142 --> 57:46.846
I kind of told Beth that
I'd hang out with her all day. You know?

57:46.847 --> 57:48.981
So why can't I hang with you guys?

57:48.982 --> 57:52.350
It's like a girls thing.
You know what I mean?

57:54.087 --> 57:55.488
No, wait, can I see you tomorrow, though?

57:55.489 --> 57:58.491
You just can't mess
with peoples lives like this, Sandra.

57:58.492 --> 58:00.860
- David. Stop.
- No.

58:00.861 --> 58:02.591
I'll just see you later.

58:14.007 --> 58:15.566
You okay?

58:21.982 --> 58:23.712
Brain going crazy?

58:30.724 --> 58:34.217
Remember the time that Mom was passed out
and Lewis tried to fuck you?

58:35.362 --> 58:37.497
Or that year that we barely slept...

58:37.498 --> 58:40.593
because that Ron guy kept
crawling into bed with us?

58:42.135 --> 58:43.870
Or that time that Doug broke Mom's jaw...

58:43.871 --> 58:46.005
and she was so drunk that
she wouldn't even go to the hospital, Sandra?

58:46.006 --> 58:47.030
Stop.

59:08.362 --> 59:09.630
Beth...

59:11.365 --> 59:12.333
please.

59:21.975 --> 59:24.570
Oh, I have such a fucking headache.

59:25.379 --> 59:26.813
Language.

59:38.025 --> 59:39.220
Here you go.

59:43.130 --> 59:44.497
What have you got there?

59:44.498 --> 59:45.932
They'll make you feel better.

59:47.868 --> 59:49.359
Thanks, angels.

59:56.610 --> 59:58.044
I didn't get that job.

01:00:01.481 --> 01:00:03.040
What are we gonna do?

01:00:06.987 --> 01:00:08.580
Time for more pills.

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:12.951
Come on, Mom.

01:00:18.265 --> 01:00:19.597
Party tonight?

01:00:20.133 --> 01:00:21.367
Yes.

01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:23.701
You never party with me.

01:00:24.371 --> 01:00:27.205
Oh, I like it when you party with me.

01:00:28.609 --> 01:00:29.577
You're so cute.

01:00:33.981 --> 01:00:36.082
Ashley wants us to videotape it.

01:00:36.083 --> 01:00:37.676
Whatever.

01:00:41.254 --> 01:00:44.224
Justin's worried were gonna kill her
with the booze and pills.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:49.054
I have the stopwatch set for four minutes.

01:00:51.865 --> 01:00:54.266
- Bath time?
- Oh, why?

01:00:54.267 --> 01:00:56.361
I'm just startin to have fun.

01:00:56.603 --> 01:00:57.434
Yeah.

01:01:03.143 --> 01:01:04.377
Come on, Mom.

01:01:04.378 --> 01:01:05.937
Let's go get you cleaned up.

01:01:06.013 --> 01:01:10.212
- I didn't think I was dirty.
- Come on.

01:01:11.018 --> 01:01:13.578
Let's get that lovely puke
smell out of your hair.

01:01:22.629 --> 01:01:24.359
- Stop!
- What?

01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:29.463
You forgot these.

01:01:31.872 --> 01:01:34.607
But our prints are already all over her.
I mean, she's our mom.

01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:36.609
Whatever. Just put them on.

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:37.578
Please.

01:01:39.746 --> 01:01:40.475
Sandra.

01:01:49.389 --> 01:01:50.482
And remember...

01:01:51.024 --> 01:01:52.117
open palm.

01:01:52.993 --> 01:01:54.120
She bruises easily.

01:02:34.101 --> 01:02:34.932
Oh, my god.

01:02:43.977 --> 01:02:46.708
Ashley, now is not a good time.

01:02:47.981 --> 01:02:48.949
Beth!

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:55.044
Beth!

01:02:55.989 --> 01:02:57.958
Beth!

01:02:58.725 --> 01:02:59.556
Beth!

01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:02.120
Why?

01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:04.964
I...

01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:11.065
That's four minutes.

01:03:14.007 --> 01:03:15.703
Oh, my god, that's four minutes?

01:03:30.490 --> 01:03:31.724
I took her ATM card.

01:03:31.725 --> 01:03:33.455
I figured we should treat for dinner, okay?

01:03:34.361 --> 01:03:36.455
- Beth, wait!
- Come on!

01:04:29.382 --> 01:04:30.350
Sod you do it?

01:04:36.122 --> 01:04:37.454
I can't believe it.

01:04:41.628 --> 01:04:42.823
Holy shit.

01:04:49.603 --> 01:04:50.736
I don't know.

01:04:50.737 --> 01:04:52.706
It's not like I thought it would be.
Not like in the movies.

01:04:53.607 --> 01:04:56.202
So you said she went into convulsions?

01:04:57.611 --> 01:05:00.746
Yeah, like,
I mean, we knew she would, but...

01:05:00.747 --> 01:05:03.082
for a minute, it was almost like
she woke back up for a second.

01:05:03.083 --> 01:05:04.750
- It was really..
- Whoa, what do you mean she woke?

01:05:04.751 --> 01:05:07.019
- Start from the beginning.
- Fuck you!

01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:09.255
- Fuck you! You left me there!
- Sandra, what is your damage?!

01:05:09.256 --> 01:05:11.857
- You fucking left me there!
- Sandra! Chillax!

01:05:11.858 --> 01:05:14.953
- Is there a problem here?
- No.

01:05:23.370 --> 01:05:24.463
Sandra.

01:05:26.139 --> 01:05:29.008
Sandra, look at me.
Come here. Come here. Look at me.

01:05:29.009 --> 01:05:30.509
We have to be strong. Okay?

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:33.379
Now is the time to be strong. Look at me.

01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:35.614
No, no, no, this isn't real.

01:05:35.615 --> 01:05:37.149
This isn't real. This is just...

01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:40.085
one of those fantasies,
like what if we were to kill Mom, you know?

01:05:40.086 --> 01:05:42.920
- This isn't real, right?
- It's real. It is real.

01:05:43.490 --> 01:05:44.321
Kay?

01:05:44.624 --> 01:05:49.495
But everything is gonna be
so much better now, I promise you.

01:05:49.496 --> 01:05:51.328
Okay, come on.
Look at me, look at me, look at me.

01:05:53.266 --> 01:05:55.826
Just do what I tell you
and we're gonna be okay.

01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:02.342
Okay.

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:06.209
Okay.

01:06:21.962 --> 01:06:22.793
Hello?

01:06:23.496 --> 01:06:26.498
My mom's not breathing! Please help me!

01:06:26.499 --> 01:06:30.736
No, I came back from dinner
with my sister and..

01:06:30.737 --> 01:06:34.239
No, I don't know what happened!
She's not breathing!

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:38.575
Please! I need like a fucking
paramedic or something, please!

01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:41.578
Yeah. Yes.

01:06:42.382 --> 01:06:45.216
310 Jackson.

01:07:08.508 --> 01:07:10.101
We tried everything we could.

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:11.942
I'm very sorry.

01:07:17.017 --> 01:07:18.576
Anything I can get you girls?

01:07:19.386 --> 01:07:21.355
No. Thank you.

01:07:22.088 --> 01:07:23.078
All right.

01:07:24.858 --> 01:07:26.125
Let us know when you're ready.

01:07:26.126 --> 01:07:28.360
We're gonna need
to ask both of you some questions.

01:07:28.361 --> 01:07:29.329
Okay.

01:08:11.137 --> 01:08:12.230
Where?

01:08:24.751 --> 01:08:28.487
They're gonna do a blood alcohol test
to confirm she was drunk.

01:08:28.488 --> 01:08:30.046
Death by vodka.

01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:39.229
When I take a bath,
I put the curtain on the outside.

01:08:41.267 --> 01:08:45.227
The medical examiner says he's ready
to conclude death by accidental drowning.

01:08:47.506 --> 01:08:48.337
Okay.

01:09:07.961 --> 01:09:08.792
So...

01:09:10.095 --> 01:09:13.499
Doug has already moved all of
Bobby's things to his home, which is great.

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:17.062
It'll be key for Bobby to have
the support of his father during all this.

01:09:18.104 --> 01:09:19.332
Thank you.

01:09:19.606 --> 01:09:23.805
We tried to get in touch with your father...
but he has yet to return our calls.

01:09:24.844 --> 01:09:27.011
Now, as far as the two of you are concerned...

01:09:27.013 --> 01:09:30.082
though you are legally old enough
to live on your own...

01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:34.214
Child Services prefers that
you live with a friend or a relative.

01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:36.680
Your aunt has offered to take you.

01:09:37.857 --> 01:09:39.689
Is that an arrangement that
would work for the two of you?

01:09:41.728 --> 01:09:43.095
Apparently...

01:09:43.095 --> 01:09:45.930
your school already thinks
that you live with me.

01:09:48.001 --> 01:09:51.270
Yay!

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:53.839
Yay for us! Yes!

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:55.809
I'll take that as a yes.

01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:02.082
Her compassion and sensitivity were envied.

01:10:03.082 --> 01:10:04.675
And I think we can all agree...

01:10:05.151 --> 01:10:07.986
Linda had a great love for her children.

01:10:07.987 --> 01:10:09.488
She would do anything for those three...

01:10:09.489 --> 01:10:15.053
Notice how everyones leaving out that she was
a pathetic alcoholic prone to dating assholes?

01:10:24.003 --> 01:10:28.031
All right, you got that, Beth?

01:10:28.374 --> 01:10:29.342
All right.

01:10:31.844 --> 01:10:34.146
Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

01:10:34.147 --> 01:10:37.584
- A flat-screen TV.
- Yes, yes, yes!

01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:43.581
Beth!

01:10:45.091 --> 01:10:47.259
Everyone deals with these things differently.

01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:51.595
- This is amazing. Thank you. So much.
- Well, I'm glad, I'm glad.

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:06.745
No, don't. Seriously.

01:11:06.746 --> 01:11:08.078
I'm not into PDAs.

01:11:09.983 --> 01:11:10.814
Since when?

01:11:11.618 --> 01:11:13.986
The whole school is talking about
what happened.

01:11:13.987 --> 01:11:16.088
They're like, Did they kill her
like they said they were gonna...

01:11:16.089 --> 01:11:18.390
or was it an accident
like the papers are saying?

01:11:18.391 --> 01:11:20.726
Oh, yeah, and I almost forgot the best part.

01:11:20.727 --> 01:11:22.628
I was talking to Donny
about my party this weekend...

01:11:22.629 --> 01:11:25.364
and he specifically asked
if you were going to be there.

01:11:25.365 --> 01:11:26.333
Wait.

01:11:26.733 --> 01:11:30.369
Wait, wait, wait.
Like Donny? Like biceps Donny?

01:11:30.370 --> 01:11:32.871
Like your ex-boyfriend Donny?
That Donny?

01:11:32.872 --> 01:11:34.239
No, no, no, no, no!
Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god!

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:35.741
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Are you okay with that? Like..

01:11:35.742 --> 01:11:38.143
Yes, I told you, I dumped his ass.

01:11:38.144 --> 01:11:40.612
Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

01:11:40.613 --> 01:11:42.582
- Oh, my god!
- Justin!

01:11:47.854 --> 01:11:49.447
Hey, can I get your picture?

01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:52.583
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:17.149
Hey, you.

01:12:17.150 --> 01:12:18.850
Donny!

01:12:18.851 --> 01:12:22.020
Donny, isn't this a great party?

01:12:22.021 --> 01:12:26.091
I mean, I love the Coldplay.

01:12:26.092 --> 01:12:26.923
Right.

01:12:27.727 --> 01:12:29.218
- So listen...
- Yeah?

01:12:30.863 --> 01:12:32.456
I gotta ask you the big question.

01:12:34.267 --> 01:12:37.969
Thank you,
but I'm not really the marrying type.

01:12:37.970 --> 01:12:39.104
You know?

01:12:39.105 --> 01:12:40.596
You know what I'm talking about.

01:12:41.841 --> 01:12:43.975
Oh, that.

01:12:43.976 --> 01:12:45.808
Yes, yes.

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:51.083
Yeah, we pumped a cap in her ass.
I mean, it was like...

01:12:51.084 --> 01:12:52.384
- bang! Bang!
- Come on, Sandra.

01:12:52.385 --> 01:12:54.853
- I need to talk for just a second.
- What do you want? You!

01:12:54.854 --> 01:12:57.389
She didn't even help.

01:12:57.390 --> 01:13:01.088
You know, she's a coward.

01:13:02.261 --> 01:13:05.097
I did it with one hand...

01:13:05.098 --> 01:13:09.229
and it only took me four minutes.

01:13:32.024 --> 01:13:35.260
Look, what was it like, you know,
to actually kill somebody?

01:13:35.261 --> 01:13:36.862
- Oh, I don't know.
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:13:36.863 --> 01:13:38.593
Give the chick some space. Come on, move.

01:14:00.019 --> 01:14:01.019
She killed her mom.

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.353
Can you please give me a second so like...

01:14:19.138 --> 01:14:23.375
Chug! Chug! Chug!

01:14:23.376 --> 01:14:25.977
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

01:14:25.978 --> 01:14:27.207
Guys, check it.

01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:32.345
Let's just get her home
before she does something stupid.

01:14:33.152 --> 01:14:34.120
Again.

01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:35.815
You're no fun anymore.

01:14:36.255 --> 01:14:39.589
If any of this gets to the police,
Ashley, were totally screwed.

01:14:40.026 --> 01:14:43.121
It just takes one person to snitch
to the cops and were dead!

01:14:46.265 --> 01:14:47.699
No offense, but...

01:14:48.601 --> 01:14:50.934
I really don't wanna be seen
with your sister right now.

01:14:52.738 --> 01:14:54.104
Just go.

01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:09.721
You helped us do it.

01:15:09.722 --> 01:15:12.390
No matter how far
you distance yourself from us...

01:15:12.391 --> 01:15:16.351
nothing can change the fact
that you helped us.

01:15:21.133 --> 01:15:22.692
Okay. Fine.

01:15:25.738 --> 01:15:34.246
- Take it off! Take it off!
- Guys, guys.

01:15:34.247 --> 01:15:36.341
Come on, Sandra.
What are you doing? Come on.

01:15:37.016 --> 01:15:39.384
Put em away. Come here. Put em away.

01:15:39.385 --> 01:15:41.581
Party's over, guys. Party's over.

01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:02.333
Well, if it isn't Drunky McPlastered.

01:16:08.247 --> 01:16:09.215
Okay.

01:16:09.849 --> 01:16:11.215
Okay. All right.

01:16:19.492 --> 01:16:22.087
What the hell?

01:16:23.963 --> 01:16:26.631
Well, best I can tell from Ashley's ramblings...

01:16:26.632 --> 01:16:30.268
you two ended up at the same house
party where you got wasted...

01:16:30.269 --> 01:16:35.367
and once again confessed to murder
several times before wandering off, so...

01:16:36.609 --> 01:16:37.577
here I am.

01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:41.211
Come on, let's go hose you down.

01:16:43.249 --> 01:16:45.218
All right.

01:16:57.096 --> 01:16:58.325
What?

01:16:59.632 --> 01:17:00.725
What?

01:17:01.267 --> 01:17:02.963
You remind me of Mom.

01:17:16.382 --> 01:17:17.816
I'm just worried about you.

01:17:18.851 --> 01:17:22.447
It's like, you've already had
to handle so much in your life...

01:17:24.090 --> 01:17:25.058
and now this.

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:28.928
Is that pot?

01:17:30.363 --> 01:17:33.800
You know, David, I'm...

01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:36.467
I'm not like this girl
you keep imagining that I am.

01:17:38.004 --> 01:17:42.507
And what exactly am I imagining you as?

01:17:42.508 --> 01:17:43.601
Good.

01:17:44.143 --> 01:17:45.941
Well, you're not a bad person.

01:17:47.146 --> 01:17:51.481
You're just a person
who's had a lot of bad stuff happen to her.

01:17:56.989 --> 01:17:58.082
Do I...

01:17:59.725 --> 01:18:00.556
What?

01:18:03.629 --> 01:18:04.961
Do I remind you of her?

01:18:07.967 --> 01:18:08.935
No.

01:18:11.137 --> 01:18:12.105
Whatever.

01:18:13.005 --> 01:18:14.098
I cheated on you.

01:18:19.245 --> 01:18:20.338
You don't believe me?

01:18:22.381 --> 01:18:24.382
I think you don't know
how to let people care about you.

01:18:24.383 --> 01:18:26.943
I think all you know
how to do is push people away.

01:18:28.621 --> 01:18:30.590
I did a really bad thing, David.

01:18:31.991 --> 01:18:33.124
Look, that doesn't matter to me.

01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:35.219
It doesn't matter if were together...

01:18:35.861 --> 01:18:37.962
or if we're just friends or whatever.

01:18:37.963 --> 01:18:41.866
Look, I just want you to know
that I care about you.

01:18:41.867 --> 01:18:44.962
And I'll always care about you, okay?
Always.

01:18:48.741 --> 01:18:50.073
What if I...

01:18:53.379 --> 01:18:55.473
what if I told you her death wasn't an accident?

01:19:02.121 --> 01:19:03.453
I don't understand.

01:19:04.256 --> 01:19:05.349
Yeah.

01:19:08.094 --> 01:19:09.084
Yeah, I...

01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:14.228
I blew a guy in a movie theatre
while my girlfriend watched.

01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:19.939
Why don't you think about that
while you're caring about me?

01:19:21.841 --> 01:19:23.571
Hey. I lied.

01:19:24.844 --> 01:19:26.073
You do remind me of her.

01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:52.966
Hey, hey, hey.

01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:19.054
Sandra?

01:20:22.368 --> 01:20:23.461
Sandra?

01:20:48.961 --> 01:20:50.930
Please let me go.

01:20:52.131 --> 01:20:54.066
No!

01:20:57.002 --> 01:20:59.801
I love you more than anything,
you stupid idiot.

01:21:01.006 --> 01:21:03.339
No! You didn't see her die!

01:21:04.009 --> 01:21:05.944
You didn't see her.

01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:09.747
We did what we did to make
our lives better and it worked.

01:21:09.748 --> 01:21:13.480
No. We didn't do anything.

01:21:13.986 --> 01:21:15.579
I did it alone.

01:21:17.389 --> 01:21:20.725
- I killed Mommy alone.
- I know.

01:21:20.726 --> 01:21:22.093
No.

01:21:22.094 --> 01:21:25.029
I know and I'm so sorry.

01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:27.829
If I could go back,
I would do things differently.

01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:29.934
Okay? I would.

01:21:30.970 --> 01:21:34.566
But you've got to stop talking
about it now, okay?

01:21:35.608 --> 01:21:36.803
Please, for you and me?

01:21:37.009 --> 01:21:40.207
For you and me,
we have to stop talking about it. Okay?

01:22:39.872 --> 01:22:40.872
Yeah, hi.

01:22:40.873 --> 01:22:44.071
Who do you talk to if you think
you have information about a murder?

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:04.057
Checking to make sure you didn't
leave anything stupid in cyberspace.

01:23:06.865 --> 01:23:08.834
You don't trust me?

01:23:20.379 --> 01:23:21.210
What's up?

01:23:21.981 --> 01:23:22.949
Hey.

01:23:24.249 --> 01:23:25.444
So what do you want?

01:23:26.018 --> 01:23:27.213
I'm just...

01:23:29.855 --> 01:23:30.823
I'm sorry.

01:23:31.123 --> 01:23:32.557
What are you sorry for?

01:23:33.726 --> 01:23:36.059
I don't know. Everything.

01:23:38.630 --> 01:23:40.826
You know,
everything that's happened to you and...

01:23:43.602 --> 01:23:44.934
what I said about you...

01:23:46.005 --> 01:23:47.200
thought about you.

01:23:49.108 --> 01:23:50.474
That's okay, I mean...

01:23:50.843 --> 01:23:52.334
at least you were thinking about me, right?

01:23:57.149 --> 01:23:58.583
You wanna go for a drive?

01:23:58.751 --> 01:23:59.844
Yeah, that sounds boring.

01:24:18.504 --> 01:24:19.335
This okay?

01:24:19.972 --> 01:24:21.099
Yeah, yeah, it's all good.

01:24:31.016 --> 01:24:33.349
It's all good. It's all good.

01:24:35.487 --> 01:24:36.455
You know..

01:24:38.090 --> 01:24:40.218
You're acting really weird.
Like even for you.

01:24:41.727 --> 01:24:43.093
No, I'm not, I just...

01:24:43.962 --> 01:24:45.055
I...

01:24:46.098 --> 01:24:49.000
that comment that you made the other night
when we saw each other...

01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:50.697
it's been driving me nuts.

01:24:51.737 --> 01:24:52.932
I can't sleep at night.

01:24:53.872 --> 01:24:56.842
The movie theatre thing?

01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:59.034
No.

01:25:01.013 --> 01:25:02.572
The other thing.

01:25:03.615 --> 01:25:06.210
About your mom's death not being an accident.

01:25:08.387 --> 01:25:10.083
Like, what did you mean when you said that?

01:25:12.991 --> 01:25:13.822
I don't know.

01:25:14.726 --> 01:25:17.821
It's okay, you know, you can talk to me.

01:25:20.732 --> 01:25:23.327
Yeah, I know.
I know, you care about me, right?

01:25:29.241 --> 01:25:30.975
I don't know, I...

01:25:30.976 --> 01:25:34.071
I just don't really know
how I'm supposed to act, you know?

01:25:36.381 --> 01:25:37.576
It's...

01:25:38.617 --> 01:25:39.710
it's tough.

01:25:43.021 --> 01:25:44.819
You know, it's like...

01:25:45.991 --> 01:25:48.358
nobody really cared about her
when she was alive, and...

01:25:50.129 --> 01:25:52.564
now nobody really cares that she's dead, so...

01:25:55.601 --> 01:25:57.433
Were you saying that...

01:25:58.604 --> 01:26:01.438
somebody like, killed her?

01:26:04.610 --> 01:26:05.578
Okay.

01:26:05.844 --> 01:26:09.147
Listen, you like really don't have
to lose any sleep over it, okay?

01:26:09.148 --> 01:26:13.151
I mean,
it's not like were gonna do it again, you know.

01:26:13.152 --> 01:26:15.712
It's not like were Bundy or anything.
You know?

01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:19.221
That's it.

01:26:24.029 --> 01:26:25.224
I thought they were all talk.

01:26:27.266 --> 01:26:30.001
Hells no, I didn't have anything to do with it.

01:26:30.002 --> 01:26:32.028
Those girls are pure sketch.

01:26:34.973 --> 01:26:37.108
They lie for attention, you know?

01:26:37.109 --> 01:26:38.475
I mean, this isn't the first time.

01:26:39.011 --> 01:26:40.511
And yet not one of you...

01:26:40.512 --> 01:26:42.613
thought it was your responsibility
to pick up the phone...

01:26:42.614 --> 01:26:44.105
and report a possible murder?

01:26:57.362 --> 01:26:59.456
I'm saying one of your friends wore a wire.

01:27:00.632 --> 01:27:02.366
We have Sandra's confession on tape.

01:27:02.367 --> 01:27:03.335
Whatever.

01:27:04.002 --> 01:27:06.938
It doesn't matter anyway.
We lied about killing our mom.

01:27:08.373 --> 01:27:09.932
We like to mess with people like that.

01:27:11.843 --> 01:27:13.436
That's a pretty sick thing to be telling people.

01:27:15.614 --> 01:27:18.584
Well, what can I say?
We're pretty messed up.

01:27:19.985 --> 01:27:22.620
There is a big difference...

01:27:22.621 --> 01:27:26.581
between being a pathological liar
and a murderer.

01:27:29.628 --> 01:27:32.598
So you say you got to
the Jack Russell restaurant around 7:15 pm?

01:27:33.498 --> 01:27:34.966
I want to see my sister. Where is she?

01:27:34.967 --> 01:27:37.368
She's in another room.

01:27:37.369 --> 01:27:38.736
Well, let me see her.

01:27:38.737 --> 01:27:41.372
Absolutely, just as soon as were done here.

01:27:41.373 --> 01:27:42.740
No, I want to see her now.

01:27:42.741 --> 01:27:45.109
I'm not gonna answer
any more questions without Beth.

01:27:45.110 --> 01:27:48.080
- Is she your lawyer?
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:50.813
Sandra, we have
you admitting everything on tape.

01:27:51.483 --> 01:27:53.150
So why don't you just tell me
what I need to hear...

01:27:53.151 --> 01:27:55.484
and then I'll take you to see Beth.

01:27:56.388 --> 01:27:57.481
I wanna see her now.

01:27:58.257 --> 01:28:00.491
- Well, it's not that simple.
- Why not?

01:28:00.492 --> 01:28:02.051
You're not getting this, are you?

01:28:02.628 --> 01:28:04.062
Beth's in a lot of trouble.

01:28:04.630 --> 01:28:06.462
Why? She had nothing to do with it.

01:28:11.136 --> 01:28:12.104
Beth!

01:28:12.971 --> 01:28:14.064
Beth!

01:28:17.009 --> 01:28:20.511
As we all know, it is a common
occurrence for accused persons...

01:28:20.512 --> 01:28:25.383
especially youths,
to confess to crimes they never committed.

01:28:25.384 --> 01:28:27.084
What are you asking for here?

01:28:27.085 --> 01:28:29.854
Given the gross constitutional violations...

01:28:29.855 --> 01:28:32.123
and the sisters fragile emotional states...

01:28:32.124 --> 01:28:34.091
I request house arrest until trial.

01:28:34.092 --> 01:28:36.861
- Your Honor..
- I'm gonna agree to that.

01:28:36.862 --> 01:28:38.963
The way those officer's behaved...

01:28:38.964 --> 01:28:41.092
you're lucky
I'm not throwing the whole thing out.

01:28:42.968 --> 01:28:44.095
Court's adjourned.

01:28:46.371 --> 01:28:47.464
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:51.375
It's okay, see?
I told you girls, it's gonna be fine.

01:28:51.376 --> 01:28:53.572
We're gonna get all this straightened out.

01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:04.919
- I've got hot chocolate.
- Yay!

01:29:06.491 --> 01:29:07.584
What are you guys playing?

01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:10.192
Ooh, can I play?

01:29:11.963 --> 01:29:13.329
- Come on, let's go.
- No, I...

01:29:15.967 --> 01:29:16.798
I...

01:29:18.003 --> 01:29:20.438
I don't think that we should go in there.

01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:22.571
Why not?

01:29:26.111 --> 01:29:28.478
It's okay. Sandra. It's okay.

01:29:29.014 --> 01:29:33.952
- It's okay.
- Let's go, let's go.

01:29:34.152 --> 01:29:35.486
Yes. Oh, my god, Beth, okay.

01:29:35.487 --> 01:29:39.090
I told you I deleted every single e-mail,
IM, text, update, everything.

01:29:39.091 --> 01:29:40.391
I mean, I even destroyed my old cell phone.

01:29:40.392 --> 01:29:41.492
Well then, what are you doing now?

01:29:41.493 --> 01:29:42.493
You know what I'm doing?

01:29:42.494 --> 01:29:44.628
I am in a Bieber and
Selena Gomez chat room...

01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:47.098
okay, because I am going
to lose my mind in this house.

01:29:47.099 --> 01:29:48.067
Whatever.

01:29:48.367 --> 01:29:50.868
Wait, what the hell are you doing?

01:29:50.869 --> 01:29:52.737
- Okay, stop! What..
- You have lost..

01:29:52.738 --> 01:29:54.271
Sandra Andersen, Beth Andersen...

01:29:54.272 --> 01:29:56.841
Detective Gates,
Armstrong County Police Department.

01:29:56.842 --> 01:29:59.744
I have a search warrant authorizing me
to search these premises...

01:29:59.745 --> 01:30:01.245
for any contraband or information...

01:30:01.246 --> 01:30:02.980
pertaining to the suspicious death

01:30:02.981 --> 01:30:04.148
- of Linda Andersen.
- Aunt Martha?

01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:05.616
- Are you kidding me?
- Officer Eli, get the tower.

01:30:05.617 --> 01:30:08.719
- Okay, no, don't grab it.
- Stay in the corner.

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:10.087
Stay in the corner?!

01:30:10.088 --> 01:30:13.124
- Am I a dog? Am I a dog?
- This is theft! This is theft!

01:30:13.125 --> 01:30:16.026
- Wallace, what do you got?
- That is our cousins.

01:30:16.027 --> 01:30:18.095
- That is not ours.
- Oh, that? Come on, please.

01:30:18.096 --> 01:30:20.264
- You can't do this.
- Well, well, well, what's this?

01:30:20.265 --> 01:30:21.999
Why weren't we told about this?

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.367
Let's get this to Forensics as well.

01:30:23.368 --> 01:30:24.369
Take it.

01:30:36.481 --> 01:30:38.849
Ashley testifies that
she witnessed the planning...

01:30:38.850 --> 01:30:41.385
of Linda Andersens murder
and that she believes...

01:30:41.386 --> 01:30:44.255
though she didn't see it,
that the sisters are guilty.

01:30:44.256 --> 01:30:46.724
In exchange,
she's not charged as an accessory...

01:30:46.725 --> 01:30:49.695
or in any other manner
in connection with this murder. Good?

01:30:51.263 --> 01:30:52.231
Works for me.

01:30:55.367 --> 01:30:56.562
I just...

01:30:57.602 --> 01:30:59.935
I can't believe I got mixed up into all this.

01:31:02.841 --> 01:31:05.037
They only latched onto me
because I'm popular.

01:31:05.844 --> 01:31:07.378
You're in a lot of trouble, son.

01:31:07.379 --> 01:31:11.248
This evidence establishes
you as a party to this murder...

01:31:11.249 --> 01:31:16.620
for supplying the Tylenol with codeine
that they used to drug her.

01:31:16.621 --> 01:31:18.989
If you testify for the prosecution...

01:31:18.990 --> 01:31:21.482
maybe I can get your sentence down.

01:31:30.135 --> 01:31:33.697
I know I'm not supposed to contact you, but...

01:31:35.140 --> 01:31:37.939
I wanted to tell you
I'm sorry about the way I acted.

01:31:39.144 --> 01:31:40.237
I love you.

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:44.675
I would never tell them anything about you.

01:31:58.096 --> 01:32:00.965
Ashley and Justin made deals
with the prosecution...

01:32:00.966 --> 01:32:04.198
and they're testifying against you
for their protection.

01:32:06.004 --> 01:32:08.940
So with this computer forensic evidence...

01:32:10.141 --> 01:32:12.235
I think it's time we consider a guilty plea.

01:32:12.744 --> 01:32:14.838
Try and work on the sentence instead.

01:32:17.616 --> 01:32:21.951
I want you out of my house.

01:32:42.741 --> 01:32:44.334
I didn't think we were allowed visitors.

01:32:47.379 --> 01:32:49.814
The police made a special exception
in my case.

01:32:50.248 --> 01:32:51.341
Why?

01:32:54.986 --> 01:32:59.481
Beth, do you think I could talk
to Sandra alone just for like a minute?

01:33:00.492 --> 01:33:02.493
We don't do that anymore. See, Sandra here...

01:33:02.494 --> 01:33:05.828
has proven herself incapable
of being alone, so...

01:33:17.242 --> 01:33:20.041
I was the one who wore the wire.

01:33:36.728 --> 01:33:37.821
I just had to.

01:34:03.121 --> 01:34:04.316
Call your next witness.

01:34:06.257 --> 01:34:07.725
Ever since I can remember...

01:34:07.726 --> 01:34:11.322
it was always my sister and
me against the big bad world.

01:34:25.610 --> 01:34:27.511
And ever since I can remember...

01:34:27.512 --> 01:34:30.107
the world was bad because of our mother.

01:35:00.845 --> 01:35:02.814
Given the overwhelming evidence...

01:35:04.382 --> 01:35:08.820
I find both defendants guilty
of murder in the first degree.

01:35:12.257 --> 01:35:14.954
I here by sentence each...

01:35:16.094 --> 01:35:18.862
to 10 years incarceration...

01:35:18.863 --> 01:35:20.832
the maximum allowable for youth.

01:35:24.269 --> 01:35:28.605
The judge said he'd seen a lot of kids
in worse off situations than ours...

01:35:28.606 --> 01:35:30.575
that didn't end up resorting to murder.

01:35:36.014 --> 01:35:37.710
Why can't we see Bobby?

01:35:40.852 --> 01:35:42.081
His dad probably won't let him.

01:35:47.625 --> 01:35:48.957
Aunt Martha?

01:35:51.496 --> 01:35:53.055
I don't think she wants to.

01:36:00.371 --> 01:36:01.464
What if...

01:36:13.852 --> 01:36:16.219
Well, you know, now that she's gone...

01:36:17.388 --> 01:36:19.118
now that Mom's gone...

01:36:22.861 --> 01:36:28.232
I guess from here on in the only people
we have to blame for our stupid, shitty lives...

01:36:28.733 --> 01:36:30.601
- I love you!
- I love you!

01:36:30.602 --> 01:36:33.800
The only people
we have to blame are ourselves.

01:36:57.629 --> 01:37:01.589
As a condition of this sentence
and their probation...

01:37:03.268 --> 01:37:06.466
the court orders that for the next 10 years...

01:37:07.005 --> 01:37:10.507
Elizabeth and Sandra Andersen...

01:37:10.508 --> 01:37:13.103
will have no contact with one another.

01:37:13.978 --> 01:37:18.473
- Under any circumstances.
- No!

01:37:19.305 --> 01:37:25.837
