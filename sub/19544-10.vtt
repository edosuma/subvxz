00:07.466 --> 00:10.674
The junior division of the
Tenkaichi Budokai had proceeded,

00:10.886 --> 00:13.798
as was widely expected,
to a championship match

00:14.014 --> 00:16.175
between Trunks and Goten.

00:16.392 --> 00:20.305
Which one of them will be the victor?

"The Junior Champ is Finally Decided!!
Who Will Fight Against Satan?!"

02:06.210 --> 02:11.044
|-|ncredible! Sure enough,
Son Goku's group is really incredible!

02:11.256 --> 02:14.919
This is it! I've been waiting
for them for a long time!

02:15.135 --> 02:17.717
This is how the Tenkaichi Budokai should be!

02:17.930 --> 02:19.966
Those guys ain't bad, huh?

02:20.182 --> 02:22.173
Yeah, they're better than I thought.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.644
They're both hanging in there, huh?

02:28.899 --> 02:30.435
Not too shabby, Goten!

02:30.651 --> 02:34.109
You sure did improve a lot
in just that short while, huh?

02:35.280 --> 02:38.522
Big Brother taught me a whole lot!

02:40.744 --> 02:43.486
Well, can you do this?

02:46.875 --> 02:49.617
He's not really thinking about
using a Ki blast from there, is he?

02:49.837 --> 02:51.452
It's gonna plow into the spectator seats!

02:51.672 --> 02:52.912
Don't do anything stupid!

02:53.131 --> 02:55.713
Nah, it's all right.

02:55.926 --> 02:59.965
He knows that much.
Give those guys a little credit.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.383
Ah! Oh, no!

03:12.985 --> 03:15.522
W-What was that just now?

03:15.737 --> 03:19.696
It looked like some incredible
rocket came out of his hands...

03:21.159 --> 03:23.286
Whew, that's a relief!

03:23.495 --> 03:24.996
See?

03:27.833 --> 03:30.290
|-|'ve seen that before...!

03:30.502 --> 03:32.538
l-lt couldn't be...

03:35.841 --> 03:37.797
How about that? Amazing, huh?

03:38.010 --> 03:42.003
I can do it, too. I just barely learned it, though.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.382
Watch this!

03:43.599 --> 03:46.841
Kamekame.. .

03:47.060 --> 03:49.722
You dummy! lt's "Kame-hame-Ha," right?

03:49.938 --> 03:52.680
...Ha!!

03:56.945 --> 03:58.185
That was a close one.

03:58.405 --> 04:01.943
He still ain't able to control the Kamehame-Ha.

04:03.869 --> 04:06.155
Oh, look at that!

04:09.041 --> 04:10.702
I hit that house!

04:10.918 --> 04:14.706
H-He looks like him! He looks
like that guy who was there

04:14.922 --> 04:18.790
during the fight with Cell!

04:19.009 --> 04:22.672
H-Hey, that other kid did the same thing.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.970
W-What the hell was that?

04:25.182 --> 04:28.049
It looks like we should
stop doing Ki blasts, huh?

04:28.268 --> 04:30.475
You're dangerous with them, Goten!

04:30.687 --> 04:33.099
Let's fight without those.

04:35.067 --> 04:39.106
All right, it's about time
you let me settle this, Goten.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.568
I'm going to be the winner!

04:48.789 --> 04:50.905
It'll be me!

05:06.556 --> 05:08.763
Huh? Trunks-kun is gone!

05:09.768 --> 05:11.008
Ta-da!

05:11.228 --> 05:13.310
Oh, no!

05:23.448 --> 05:25.655
Uh-oh. Goten...

05:27.703 --> 05:30.445
How about that, Goten? Say you give up!

05:30.664 --> 05:33.201
No way!

05:33.417 --> 05:37.251
H-Hey, any way you look at it,
aren't they hovering in mid-air?

05:37.462 --> 05:39.202
M-Mm-hmm...

05:41.591 --> 05:43.001
H-Hurry up and say you give up!

05:43.218 --> 05:46.551
If I squeeze you any tighter,
you're going to die!

05:53.895 --> 05:56.762
It looks like Trunks has won this one.

05:56.982 --> 05:59.439
Goten, hang in there! Ride it out!

06:05.657 --> 06:08.319
|-| said say it! Now say it!

06:20.380 --> 06:24.339
Whoa! He can turn Super Saiyan?!

06:24.551 --> 06:26.132
Oh, Goten, you dummy!

06:26.344 --> 06:28.084
Th-That's dirty pool, Kakarrot!

06:28.305 --> 06:31.923
Huh? Oh, I don't know why you're telling me.

06:43.695 --> 06:47.859
D-Didn't that one over there
seem different somehow, just now?

06:48.075 --> 06:50.782
|-| had the same thought.

06:52.829 --> 06:56.037
What is this? A dream? A vision?

06:58.543 --> 07:04.379
l-lt's him, all right...! N-No doubt about it...!

07:04.591 --> 07:09.802
That's his child! He's the spitting image!

07:11.681 --> 07:13.387
That's cheating, Goten!

07:13.600 --> 07:17.559
I thought we weren't going
to turn Super Saiyan!

07:17.771 --> 07:21.559
Sorry, I couldn't help myself!
I won't do it again, okay?

07:21.775 --> 07:24.061
Hmph. Well, all right.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.188
Heh-heh, Goten!

07:28.073 --> 07:29.779
What?

07:29.991 --> 07:32.243
If I really wanted to,

07:32.452 --> 07:36.491
I could beat you without
even using my left hand!

07:36.706 --> 07:40.449
Huh? No way! No, you can't!

07:40.669 --> 07:41.454
Yes, I can!

07:41.670 --> 07:43.581
No, you can't! Go ahead and try!

07:43.797 --> 07:46.834
And don't you dare use your left hand, okay?

07:47.050 --> 07:49.541
All right, then! Here goes!

08:02.232 --> 08:04.564
Trunks!

08:04.776 --> 08:07.734
Goten-chan! Go! Get him!

08:15.787 --> 08:18.324
Well? Can you fix it?

08:18.540 --> 08:20.531
What are you doing?

08:23.253 --> 08:26.495
It's no use. I can't even tell
what's causing the malfunction.

08:26.715 --> 08:29.798
Hey, don't we have any other TV cameras?!

08:30.010 --> 08:33.844
|-|'m afraid not. Even the
backup camera is busted.

08:34.054 --> 08:35.591
It looks like the other stations' cameras,

08:35.807 --> 08:39.220
plus the spectators' home video
and cameras, are all out of commission.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.893
How can that be? It's weird, right?

08:42.105 --> 08:45.723
How can this be?! How can we not
capture such an incredible fight?!

08:45.942 --> 08:47.443
Damn it!

09:08.632 --> 09:10.293
No fair!

09:21.478 --> 09:26.347
H-Hey, he's totally flying through
the air, right? I'm sure of it.

09:26.566 --> 09:31.401
Wow, Goten has completely mastered
the Bukujutsu technique, huh?

09:31.613 --> 09:34.320
What exactly does he have in mind?

09:36.701 --> 09:40.660
Huh?! Gohan-kun, you gave Goten-Chan
some kind of special training

09:40.872 --> 09:44.035
that you kept from me, didn't you?!

09:44.251 --> 09:46.742
N-No, not really. The same as we always do.

09:46.962 --> 09:49.203
ReaHy?

09:49.422 --> 09:52.630
But then, how did he get like that?

09:56.096 --> 09:58.007
Charge!

10:04.145 --> 10:07.888
He's planning to use the momentum of
his fall to boost his speed and charge me,

10:08.108 --> 10:09.848
while watching to see how I move!

10:10.068 --> 10:13.560
All right, I'll stay here and
avoid him at the last instant!

10:13.780 --> 10:18.740
He just barely learned how to fly.
He won't be able to keep up with me.

10:29.671 --> 10:32.287
Now! Go ahead and crash!

10:32.507 --> 10:34.008
What?!

10:48.064 --> 10:48.849
Goten...

10:49.065 --> 10:51.977
Man, you dummy!

11:04.372 --> 11:08.581
Ringout! Contestant Trunks wins!
He is the victor!

11:08.793 --> 11:11.250
He is the victor of the junior division!

11:11.463 --> 11:14.500
I did it! I did it!

11:15.508 --> 11:18.671
Wow! Trunks is the victor!

11:18.887 --> 11:20.627
G-Goten-chan...

11:20.847 --> 11:25.011
--Good going! Good going,
good going, Trunks! Woo-hoo!
--Mm-hmm, Goten and Trunks both fought well.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.387
I'm going to score, too!

11:27.604 --> 11:29.094
Perv!

11:32.359 --> 11:35.647
What was that, Trunks-kun?!
You cheated, didn't you?!

11:35.862 --> 11:40.401
You turned Super Saiyan,
andyou used your left hand!

11:40.617 --> 11:41.857
Cheater! Cheater!

11:42.077 --> 11:44.693
Sorry, sorry! I couldn't help it.

11:44.913 --> 11:49.828
But you turned Super Saiyan
back there, too, so we're even.

11:50.043 --> 11:53.285
And it's not like I hit you
directly with my left hand.

11:53.505 --> 11:56.417
Man up and quit your complaining.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.716
What? Don't be so sore!

11:59.928 --> 12:03.341
I'll let you have any three
of my toys that you like.

12:03.556 --> 12:07.174
Huh? Really? |'|| hold you to that!

12:07.394 --> 12:10.261
That's a promise, then! Okay?

12:24.244 --> 12:26.735
Hey, too bad.

12:26.955 --> 12:31.289
It looks to me like my son
got the better bloodline.

12:33.086 --> 12:37.375
|-| don't know what ljust saw,
b-but that was a spectacular match!

12:37.590 --> 12:39.876
|-|'ve never seen anything like that before.

12:43.555 --> 12:48.390
Okay, after that intense match,
we now have an enjoyable attraction!

12:48.601 --> 12:52.685
We're going to have Trunks-kun,
who just won the junior division,

12:52.897 --> 12:56.389
fight the world champion, Mister Satan!

12:58.903 --> 13:06.275
Satan! Satan! Satan! Satan!...

13:26.473 --> 13:29.215
W-What am I gonna do...?

13:40.069 --> 13:47.362
Satan! Satan! Satan! Satan!...

13:53.249 --> 13:56.332
Well, I wonder what that guy will do.

13:56.544 --> 13:59.377
I'll bet he says, "It's a trick!"

14:02.008 --> 14:04.374
There's no way he can stand up to Trunks.

14:06.554 --> 14:09.512
Pay them no mind, pay them no mind!

14:12.310 --> 14:19.478
Satan! Satan! Satan! Satan!...

14:19.692 --> 14:22.434
Lucky you, Trunks-kun.

14:29.536 --> 14:33.370
Wow, I have to say,
that is one mighty little tyke.

14:33.581 --> 14:34.866
I'll bet even the great Mister Satan

14:35.083 --> 14:38.041
will have to keep his eyes open, won't he?

14:38.253 --> 14:42.166
|-| might even have to take this seriously...

14:42.382 --> 14:44.589
Don't be silly.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.757
l'm joking, l'm joking!

14:49.472 --> 14:53.681
W-What do I do? l-l'm going to die out there!

14:53.893 --> 14:56.509
Shall we take a short break
before we continue?

14:56.729 --> 14:58.105
I'm fine.

14:58.314 --> 15:02.353
| see. Well then, Mister Satan, if you please...!

15:05.196 --> 15:07.187
Go ahead, Mister Satan.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.023
lt's Mister Satan!

15:10.243 --> 15:12.074
The world's greatest!

15:14.330 --> 15:16.707
Who is the little kid that challenges me,

15:16.916 --> 15:19.328
the world champion, Mister Satan?!

15:19.544 --> 15:25.665
Satan! Satan! Satan!...

15:28.636 --> 15:29.796
Is it you?!

15:30.013 --> 15:32.504
I sure hope you're ready for this!

15:40.023 --> 15:42.981
W-What do I do? What do I do?!

15:43.192 --> 15:47.561
If I'm dreaming, please let me wake up!

15:47.780 --> 15:50.647
This old guy is the world champion, huh?

15:50.867 --> 15:53.074
I never would have expected that.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.618
I wonder if he's even stronger than Dad.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.786
Trunks-kun, good luck!

15:58.791 --> 16:03.000
Nobody asked you! He doesn't need any luck!

16:04.255 --> 16:06.541
Well, should we start heading back now?

16:06.758 --> 16:09.374
I think the preliminaries
should be done by now.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.960
Yeah, right. Let's go see.

16:12.180 --> 16:13.545
H-Hold on!

16:13.765 --> 16:16.006
That boy is one of you people, right?

16:16.225 --> 16:18.352
He's going to fight Mister Satan now!

16:18.561 --> 16:19.926
Aren't you going to watch first?!

16:20.146 --> 16:24.981
Y-Yes! Yes, we are! It might just
turn out to be a good match!

16:25.193 --> 16:27.184
Well, we're heading out now.

16:59.936 --> 17:04.851
--Satan! Satan! Satan!...
--W-What was that just now?

17:05.066 --> 17:07.057
That wasn't at all amazing.

17:07.276 --> 17:10.313
Could he be putting on
a pathetic act on purpose?

17:10.530 --> 17:13.818
Yeah, that's it. He's the
world champion, after all.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.444
All right, let's do this!

17:22.040 --> 17:25.157
H-Hey! What are you getting worked up for?

17:25.377 --> 17:29.792
Th-This match is just an attraction!
A little casual tomfoolery!

17:30.007 --> 17:33.625
So let's just keep it lighthearted, okay? Okay?

17:35.638 --> 17:38.550
No way! I'm going all-out!

17:40.518 --> 17:43.055
Y-You idiot! This is just
fun and games, you know!

17:43.271 --> 17:44.181
Don't act childish!

17:44.397 --> 17:45.512
But I am a child.

17:45.732 --> 17:50.647
Y-You stubborn blockhead!
Enough kidding around, already!

17:50.862 --> 17:52.102
But I am a kid.

17:52.321 --> 17:55.063
Okay, so, everything is ready, right?

17:55.283 --> 17:57.569
Well then, why don't we get this started?

17:59.036 --> 18:00.776
That kid is ridiculously strong,

18:00.997 --> 18:03.113
but I'll bet that Satan has to be even stronger.

18:03.332 --> 18:06.745
Well, of course. He was strong
enough to defeat Cell, after all.

18:06.961 --> 18:08.917
Trunks! Go! Go!

18:09.130 --> 18:12.463
W-W-What am I supposed to do?

18:12.675 --> 18:14.336
|-| know!

18:15.970 --> 18:20.634
Uh-oh! Whatever could be
the matter with Mister Satan?

18:20.850 --> 18:23.387
Mister Satan, what is it?

18:23.603 --> 18:26.640
|-| hurt my knee during the battle with Cell,

18:26.856 --> 18:29.893
a-and now it's...

18:30.109 --> 18:33.397
Huh? You hurt your knee during that battle?

18:33.613 --> 18:37.322
Y-Yeah. I had been keeping it a secret,
but the truth is, I did.

18:37.533 --> 18:40.445
A-And unfortunately, now, of all times...

18:40.661 --> 18:43.152
We have a doctor here.
Let's allow him to take a look.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.908
I'll go get him.

18:46.417 --> 18:50.251
I'm all right! It appears to be better.
I should be able to fight.

18:50.463 --> 18:54.547
I am the world champion, after all.
This is not a big deal at all.

18:54.759 --> 18:56.090
Are you sure you're all right?

18:57.470 --> 19:01.258
It's all right! Mister Satan will fight!

19:05.728 --> 19:10.438
l-lt's about to begin...
What do I do...? What do I do...?!

19:10.650 --> 19:15.565
If I lose to a kid,
it will damage my reputation...

19:15.780 --> 19:17.520
That's it! Since my opponent is a child,

19:17.740 --> 19:19.822
I can just pretend to lose on purpose!

19:20.034 --> 19:22.116
That should work! That's what I'll do!

19:22.328 --> 19:25.320
--All right...
--J-Just a second!

19:25.540 --> 19:28.953
Trunks-kun, now that I think about it,
| forgot to tell you

19:29.168 --> 19:33.252
the special salutation that
we're doing for this attraction.

19:33.464 --> 19:34.328
Salutation?

19:34.549 --> 19:37.962
That's right! Are you ready?
Once the match begins,

19:38.177 --> 19:40.293
the first thing you do is stick your fist out

19:40.513 --> 19:44.552
to the champion's face and
gently, gently give it a little tap.

19:44.767 --> 19:49.227
That's how we do it here. Just like this. Got it?

19:49.438 --> 19:54.307
But you must not salute me as hard
as you can! Got it? Understood?

19:54.527 --> 19:57.109
I understand. Just a tap, right?

19:58.614 --> 20:01.321
All right, we can begin now!

20:02.827 --> 20:05.534
The boy said he wanted my autograph,

20:05.746 --> 20:08.158
so I told him we would do that later.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.456
Ah, I see.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.786
This should be good!
All right then, let the match

20:15.006 --> 20:17.213
between the junior
division champion, Trunks-kun,

20:17.425 --> 20:19.791
and Mister Satan now begin!

20:22.138 --> 20:24.880
Okay, come at me!

20:36.068 --> 20:40.357
Oh, what's this? Mister Satan
has stuck out his face,

20:40.573 --> 20:43.235
almost as though he's begging
to be hit. What composure!

20:43.451 --> 20:46.909
What composure from Mister Satan!

20:47.121 --> 20:49.282
--Attaway!
--Do your worst, squirt!

20:50.791 --> 20:52.292
Tap.

21:12.063 --> 21:15.226
P-P-Papa...!

21:15.441 --> 21:19.480
Th-That idiot! Pull your punch more!

21:20.488 --> 21:24.731
The youngster showdown ends
with Trunks the victor.

21:24.951 --> 21:30.821
The showdown with Mister Satan...?
Uh-oh! Now he's done it!

22:41.777 --> 22:43.358
Heya! l'm Goku!

22:43.571 --> 22:46.062
It looks like the idea that all of us
are going to win easily

22:46.282 --> 22:49.365
ain't necessarily true. I'm getting excited!

22:49.577 --> 22:52.660
Hey, Goten, let's both of us
switch places with that masked man

22:52.872 --> 22:55.409
and enter the matches with the adults!

22:55.624 --> 22:57.364
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:57.585 --> 23:00.952
"Restless Foreboding...
A Mysterious Warrior Appears!!"

23:01.172 --> 23:05.040
Looking closely, there are some
odd characters in this tournament.
