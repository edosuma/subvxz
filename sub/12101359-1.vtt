00:42.350 --> 00:45.854
<i>Hey, Mr. Waters, this is Jeremy
over in Dr. Andrews' office.</i>

00:45.937 --> 00:48.315
<i>Just calling to confirm
your follow-up appointment</i>

00:48.398 --> 00:49.524
<i>tomorrow at 2.</i>

00:49.608 --> 00:52.360
<i>Call if you have questions.
We'll see you then.</i>

00:54.821 --> 00:56.573
<i>Bart, it's Dr. Andrews.</i>

00:56.656 --> 00:58.575
<i>We missed you
at your appointment yesterday,</i>

00:58.658 --> 01:01.286
{\an8}<i>so calling to check in.</i>

01:01.369 --> 01:05.165
{\an8}<i>It's important we maintain contact
with patients for a few months</i>

01:05.247 --> 01:06.666
<i>after they're under our care.</i>

01:06.750 --> 01:10.086
<i>So let's get
another appointment in the books.</i>

01:10.170 --> 01:13.256
<i>Just wanted to make sure
we avoid any backsliding.</i>

01:17.052 --> 01:19.095
<i>Hey, B, it's Whit.</i>

01:19.679 --> 01:22.015
<i>I got a call
from a psychiatrist's office yesterday.</i>

01:22.098 --> 01:25.560
<i>I guess I must still be listed
as your emergency contact.</i>

01:25.644 --> 01:27.979
<i>You should probably change that
at some point.</i>

01:28.063 --> 01:31.441
<i>Anyhow, they wanted you to call
to set up an appointment soon.</i>

01:31.525 --> 01:33.485
<i>It's none of my business now,</i>

01:33.568 --> 01:36.363
<i>but I just wanna make sure
you're taking care of yourself.</i>

01:36.446 --> 01:40.033
<i>So call them, Bart, please.</i>

01:40.116 --> 01:41.826
<i>Okay? I'm thinking about you.</i>

01:44.788 --> 01:46.748
<i>Bart, it's Dr. Andrews again.</i>

01:46.831 --> 01:49.668
<i>It's really pertinent
that you continue to...</i>

02:00.220 --> 02:02.597
Okay. Well, I wish you hadn't done that.

02:03.348 --> 02:05.976
But that doesn't make any sense. Yeah.

02:06.768 --> 02:08.936
- 409.
- Sorry, I dozed off there.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.314
Okay. This is an old building,

02:11.398 --> 02:14.818
so, you know, you have to be sensitive
about the plumbing.

02:14.901 --> 02:16.570
- Can I?
- Help yourself.

02:16.653 --> 02:18.989
Okay, well, you know, the rule of thumb

02:19.072 --> 02:22.242
is that if it's bigger than a goldfish,
you don't flush it.

02:22.325 --> 02:23.952
No. Okay.

02:24.035 --> 02:26.872
No, I'll send a plumber over later.
Yeah. Bye.

02:27.497 --> 02:30.458
That bitch tried
to flush a gerbil down the toilet.

02:30.542 --> 02:33.211
- Who does that?
- Are we allowed to have gerbils here?

02:33.295 --> 02:37.382
- Not anymore. Fuck.
- You're having a good day, aren't you?

02:38.258 --> 02:40.552
You're lucky you have booze.
Thanks for the shot.

02:40.635 --> 02:43.096
- Yeah.
- We're showing this place in 20 minutes.

02:43.179 --> 02:45.348
- Is that okay?
- Yeah. I'm gonna get out of here.

02:45.432 --> 02:48.435
- Bart, don't leave me.
- I wish I could stay,

02:48.518 --> 02:51.271
but unless you get them
to lower the rent by...

02:51.980 --> 02:53.648
like, all of it, I gotta go.

02:53.732 --> 02:56.568
- What am I gonna do without you?
- You're gonna be fine.

02:56.651 --> 02:57.861
Yeah, yeah.

02:57.944 --> 03:00.780
So you'll be out
by the beginning of next month?

03:00.864 --> 03:01.781
Yes, ma'am.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.534
I'll miss you.

03:04.618 --> 03:07.621
Oh, 206. I hate my fucking job.

03:07.704 --> 03:09.372
Eddie, what?

03:10.332 --> 03:11.458
I'm not doing that.

03:11.541 --> 03:15.128
Because I cannot control when 306 has sex.

03:15.212 --> 03:17.672
I can't tell someone
they have to fuck on their couch

03:17.756 --> 03:19.841
because their mattress is too loud.

03:29.768 --> 03:31.478
Shit.

03:32.479 --> 03:35.357
Come on in, man.
I'd offer to help, but my hands are full.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.399
Also, I don't want to.

03:37.526 --> 03:40.403
- That all your shit?
- Not all of it but there's not much left.

03:40.487 --> 03:43.490
Right on. We got plenty of space.
Teddy, don't do that.

03:43.573 --> 03:45.784
I'm not Teddy. I'm Naked Guy.

03:45.867 --> 03:47.744
Well, Naked Guy, don't do that.

03:47.827 --> 03:48.912
Jeez. Rachel!

03:49.538 --> 03:52.040
- Rach!
- Jesus! I'm going to the bathroom.

03:52.123 --> 03:54.543
Eve needs you, and Naked Guy's
fucking up the chair again.

03:54.626 --> 03:58.338
- I just want two seconds of peace.
- Oh, my God. I'm just a dad.

03:58.421 --> 04:00.382
Let's get you situated. Come on.

04:01.466 --> 04:03.552
Naked Guy!

04:03.635 --> 04:05.929
Are you sure me staying here
isn't too much?

04:06.012 --> 04:08.098
Fuck, no, man.
You need to get out of that place.

04:08.181 --> 04:12.018
Besides, it'll be fun having you around.
Like old times, you know?

04:12.102 --> 04:14.229
Rachel? Rachel!

04:14.312 --> 04:16.648
You could stay here
as long as you want. Seriously.

04:16.730 --> 04:18.649
- Kids love you.
- Hey, I got her.

04:18.732 --> 04:22.278
Listen, Teddy has left
something very upsetting

04:22.362 --> 04:24.614
next to the toilet on the floor,
if you could...

04:24.698 --> 04:27.242
Hi, Bart. Welcome.
Happy to have you here.

04:27.325 --> 04:28.702
Don't use the bathroom.

04:30.495 --> 04:32.122
- Are you on your way?
- Yeah.

04:32.205 --> 04:33.373
Okay. Bye.

04:34.124 --> 04:35.584
I should be getting this job.

04:35.667 --> 04:38.378
- I'll be out of your hair soon.
- Dude, shut up. All right?

04:38.461 --> 04:41.631
You can stay here forever.
I mean that. Okay?

04:59.774 --> 05:01.276
So, yeah, man.

05:02.360 --> 05:03.778
I read through your samples,

05:03.862 --> 05:08.074
and I'm no literary critic or anything,
but they seem really good to me.

05:08.158 --> 05:09.743
- Thank you.
- For real, dude.

05:09.826 --> 05:13.788
I love this one
about the guy whose fiancÃ©e left him

05:13.872 --> 05:15.498
and he has a nervous breakdown.

05:15.582 --> 05:18.084
I mean, that's... It feels so real.

05:18.710 --> 05:22.088
- Well, it should.
- I thought <i>Marley & Me</i> was sad, but...

05:22.172 --> 05:24.090
Hey, you ever see <i>Marley & Me?</i>

05:25.467 --> 05:27.010
- I have not.
- You should.

05:27.093 --> 05:30.055
I love dog movies.
But spoiler, the pup dies.

05:32.682 --> 05:35.101
I kind of feel
like you're too good for this job.

05:35.727 --> 05:38.396
Well, thanks for saying that,
but, you know...

05:39.439 --> 05:42.567
To be honest, stories like that
don't really help keep the lights on.

05:42.651 --> 05:46.488
Well, you won't write anything
super creative for our catalogs,

05:46.571 --> 05:50.283
- but I bet you'll have fun with it.
- Writing's writing to me, honestly.

05:50.367 --> 05:54.496
- So I am happy to tackle anything.
- Okay. It's pretty straightforward.

05:54.579 --> 05:56.373
We give you a product and research data,

05:56.456 --> 05:59.167
and you write up something
that sounds exciting to our clients.

05:59.793 --> 06:03.755
Like this fella.
This is a new catheter. You can hold it.

06:03.838 --> 06:07.050
It's smaller and more malleable.
You barely even know it's there.

06:07.133 --> 06:09.803
Well, you know it's there
because it's a huge tube

06:09.886 --> 06:11.429
that's going up your penis.

06:11.513 --> 06:13.598
Smaller and more malleable
does seem advantageous

06:13.682 --> 06:15.392
- in the world of penis tubes.
- See?

06:16.560 --> 06:17.853
That already sounds better.

06:18.812 --> 06:19.896
Well, we'll let you know.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.107
And, hey, I always tell new friends,

06:22.190 --> 06:24.568
I'm really into game nights,
if you ever host one.

07:11.156 --> 07:12.157
Hey. One, please.

07:27.339 --> 07:30.759
<i>Bart, Dr. Andrews again.
Still haven't heard from you.</i>

07:30.842 --> 07:34.471
<i>I would really encourage you
to set an appointment soon.</i>

07:34.554 --> 07:36.264
<i>It's really not a big thing.</i>

07:36.348 --> 07:38.183
<i>It's just to assess how you're feeling</i>

07:38.266 --> 07:40.810
<i>and make sure
the new dosage is working for you.</i>

07:40.894 --> 07:43.605
<i>So just call my office
and we will be here.</i>

08:21.977 --> 08:24.646
<i>And it was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.</i>

08:28.149 --> 08:29.317
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

08:31.194 --> 08:33.071
- Buddy.
- Hey, buddy.

08:34.489 --> 08:35.823
The movie's over.

08:39.410 --> 08:40.953
The movie's over.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.207
Oh, shit.

08:47.252 --> 08:48.086
Thanks.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.264
Hey! Hey, bud.

09:02.225 --> 09:04.102
- Your jacket.
- Oh, shit. Thanks.

09:04.186 --> 09:06.897
Yeah. You left it on your seat.

09:08.690 --> 09:12.736
- I was drinking a little bit in there.
- Yeah, I saw that.

09:14.446 --> 09:16.698
I'm batting a thousand here, aren't I?

09:16.781 --> 09:19.659
It's okay. It seems like a pretty fun way
to spend an afternoon.

09:19.743 --> 09:22.704
Yeah. I've had worse.
Thanks. Thanks again.

09:25.540 --> 09:26.625
Hey.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.337
Do you know where I could
maybe grab one of those around here?

09:31.338 --> 09:33.548
- Oh, you mean go get a drink?
- Yeah.

09:34.257 --> 09:36.051
There's two bars pretty close.

09:37.260 --> 09:38.887
One is kind of a dive.

09:39.638 --> 09:41.264
The other is a little fancier.

09:41.348 --> 09:45.060
It's one of those craft cocktail,
mixology-type places.

09:45.143 --> 09:46.520
Okay, cool. Let's go.

09:47.145 --> 09:49.272
- I'm sorry. You want me to go?
- Yeah.

09:49.356 --> 09:53.109
I don't really know the area.
I've just been wandering around by myself.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.570
Honestly, I'm getting a little bored.

09:55.654 --> 09:59.032
You seem like you're
a relatively harmless human.

09:59.115 --> 10:01.368
You don't murder people, do you?

10:01.451 --> 10:03.578
No. Murder-free thus far.

10:03.662 --> 10:04.663
Cool.

10:05.413 --> 10:07.874
So long as you keep that streak alive,

10:07.958 --> 10:11.795
I think you should come
have a drink with me.

10:12.671 --> 10:14.798
- Really?
- Really.

10:14.881 --> 10:15.882
Come on.

10:16.841 --> 10:19.761
All right. Fuck it. Let's drink, then.

10:19.844 --> 10:20.929
Lead the way.

10:21.763 --> 10:22.597
Okay.

10:25.433 --> 10:28.436
- Hey, I'm Vienna.
- Hi. I'm Bart.

10:28.520 --> 10:29.646
Nice to meet you.

10:30.939 --> 10:32.899
- Wait. Really?
- Yeah. It's a really good movie.

10:32.983 --> 10:36.152
So it's one of your favorite films
and you've seen it over a hundred times

10:36.236 --> 10:37.654
and you can't articulate why.

10:37.737 --> 10:39.990
It's just a really good movie.

10:41.533 --> 10:42.367
I guess...

10:43.535 --> 10:46.872
I'm kind of an emotional person, I guess.

10:47.622 --> 10:48.748
Okay.

10:48.832 --> 10:52.627
And a few years ago,
I happened to catch <i>Being There</i> on TV,

10:52.711 --> 10:54.629
and I don't know why, but...

10:55.672 --> 11:00.051
Somehow, watching it on my couch that day,
something just clicked for me.

11:00.135 --> 11:04.848
Life is gonna be sad and stressful
and tragic and devastating,

11:04.931 --> 11:06.933
and that's just unavoidable, you know?

11:07.017 --> 11:10.896
But that movie is like a reminder
that it's all a state of mind.

11:10.979 --> 11:14.900
We could make all that shit
as big or as little as we want.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.237
I'm not saying
the movie cured me or anything,

11:19.321 --> 11:23.033
but in that moment
it did make me feel a little better.

11:23.825 --> 11:25.202
Well, that's something.

11:27.746 --> 11:28.997
Did it do that today?

11:31.583 --> 11:32.959
- Not really.
- Why not?

11:33.043 --> 11:34.711
I don't know. Just didn't.

11:34.794 --> 11:36.004
Doing okay, folks?

11:36.963 --> 11:38.924
- Yes. We're good. Thanks.
- Yeah.

11:39.007 --> 11:41.176
So, what brings you to town?

11:42.969 --> 11:45.639
Like, where are you from
and what do you do

11:45.722 --> 11:46.723
and why are you here?

11:49.184 --> 11:52.604
Let's get out of here. Yeah?

11:53.271 --> 11:54.356
Yeah?

11:54.439 --> 11:56.441
- Yeah.
- Take me to that dive bar.

11:57.025 --> 11:57.901
Really?

11:57.984 --> 12:00.362
- Yeah. This is too fancy.
- All right, let's go.

12:00.445 --> 12:02.280
- I got the check.
- I can get it.

12:05.116 --> 12:07.410
- Just...
- Jesus Christ.

12:07.494 --> 12:10.247
Are you going to the strip club later,
or did you just rob a bank?

12:10.330 --> 12:13.083
No, no. I just have problems
with my bank card,

12:13.166 --> 12:15.210
so I brought cash for my trip.

12:15.293 --> 12:18.213
- Is 60 good?
- Sixty? That's way too much.

12:18.296 --> 12:21.049
It'll be like half that. Nice tip. Here.

12:21.883 --> 12:23.385
Okay. Cool.

12:23.468 --> 12:26.513
L.A. prices,
I just thought it would be more.

12:26.596 --> 12:28.723
Take me to this dive.

12:28.807 --> 12:30.100
- All right.
- Oh, wait.

12:31.393 --> 12:34.980
So is this funky bar of yours,
are they strict about carding?

12:35.063 --> 12:37.315
'Cause I forgot my ID at home.

12:38.191 --> 12:41.361
Well, you look way over 21,
so I think you'll be fine.

12:41.444 --> 12:43.196
Cool, trying to be charming.

12:44.781 --> 12:46.950
You're a cute girl.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.994
- You'll be fine.
- You think I'm cute?

12:49.828 --> 12:52.539
Well, yeah.
I mean, you look great for 50.

12:54.291 --> 12:57.502
Oh, my God. Look at those!

12:58.211 --> 12:59.254
Sparklers?

12:59.880 --> 13:02.048
Yeah, sparklers.

13:02.924 --> 13:06.094
I didn't know they made those anymore.

13:06.177 --> 13:08.763
You're kind of easily impressed,
aren't you?

13:08.847 --> 13:11.975
I... I've just never done
a sparkler before.

13:12.934 --> 13:13.977
I'm sorry, what?

13:14.686 --> 13:16.688
- Yep.
- You've never played with a sparkler?

13:16.771 --> 13:17.606
Nope.

13:18.315 --> 13:21.151
- Did you have a childhood?
- Yes, I did.

13:21.234 --> 13:24.487
I just didn't play with sparklers,
I guess.

13:26.072 --> 13:26.990
Okay, hold on.

13:27.741 --> 13:29.367
- What? Okay.
- One second.

13:32.454 --> 13:37.834
Could I...? Could I buy two sparklers
from you for one whole dollar?

13:37.918 --> 13:40.587
- Okay.
- All right. Thanks!

13:44.382 --> 13:46.092
What?

13:46.176 --> 13:48.970
- How'd you do that?
- I gave him a dollar.

13:49.054 --> 13:52.057
- To a kid, that's like a million bucks.
- You didn't have to do that.

13:52.724 --> 13:53.725
I did have to do that

13:53.808 --> 13:56.811
because you've never played
with a sparkler and that's just weird.

13:56.895 --> 13:58.688
I don't wanna hang out with a weirdo.

13:58.772 --> 14:02.484
- So I did it for selfish reasons, really.
- Okay.

14:03.151 --> 14:06.404
- Okay, fine.
- Okay. All right. Here goes...

14:07.072 --> 14:09.324
- What little crooks.
- This is really anticlimactic!

14:09.991 --> 14:12.035
- Kind of hurts your hand.
- You gotta run with it.

14:12.118 --> 14:14.454
- Run. Yeah.
- No, I'm not running alone!

14:14.538 --> 14:17.332
This is not some solo show, bro.

14:17.415 --> 14:19.876
You've gotta run with me. Come on!

14:42.774 --> 14:45.610
If you want mediocrity in impressions

14:45.694 --> 14:47.529
or just in life in general,

14:48.113 --> 14:49.865
- you've come to the right guy.
- Pacino.

14:52.659 --> 14:55.078
Funny. Funny guy.

14:55.161 --> 14:57.998
So scary. Jimmy Stewart.

14:58.957 --> 15:00.041
Jimmy Stewart.

15:00.876 --> 15:03.795
I don't have your money, Mr. Potter.

15:03.879 --> 15:05.922
I don't know where your money is.

15:06.548 --> 15:09.259
- These are legitimately good.
- Hold on one second.

15:10.260 --> 15:11.761
Wait. What are you doing?

15:11.845 --> 15:15.307
- The dive only takes cash.
- Yeah, but I've got cash.

15:15.849 --> 15:18.518
I know you have cash.
You have like all of the cash.

15:18.602 --> 15:22.731
But I can't let you buy drinks all night.
I gotta pull my weight a little bit.

15:23.315 --> 15:24.900
And now I've got your passcode.

15:24.983 --> 15:27.235
Hey, ho.

15:27.319 --> 15:29.154
Hey, ho.

15:29.905 --> 15:33.158
Is that what you do?
It's how you got all that cash?

15:33.241 --> 15:36.995
You just sidle up
to handsome dudes and charm them

15:37.078 --> 15:40.040
till they let their guard down at an ATM?

15:40.123 --> 15:43.501
And now I'm going to take you
for everything you're worth.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.880
Well, you done picked
the wrong mark, buddy.

15:46.963 --> 15:48.465
Because I got...

15:50.133 --> 15:52.469
324 bucks in there.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.471
- Feel free to rob me blind.
- Oh, my God.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.514
- You're not kidding.
- I'm not kidding.

15:56.598 --> 15:58.600
- I'm gonna do it.
- Take it. Really.

15:58.683 --> 16:00.644
It won't matter. It really won't.

16:01.186 --> 16:04.689
- Ma'am, would you like my bank passcode?
- Did you just call me "ma'am"?

16:06.107 --> 16:08.610
Yes, I did. That's my bad. Apologies.

16:08.693 --> 16:10.695
- So sorry. He's drunk.
- Have a nice night.

16:10.779 --> 16:11.655
Cute dog.

16:15.408 --> 16:18.203
So it was like a hopeful look at humanity?

16:18.286 --> 16:19.829
- How novel.
- Oh, yeah.

16:19.913 --> 16:22.207
It was a novel idea for a novel.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.502
Not novel enough
for anyone to publish it...

16:25.585 --> 16:28.547
- Yeah, well, they're dummies.
- Yeah, maybe not.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.967
And how'd you come up
with this novel idea?

16:34.469 --> 16:36.179
I don't know. I think...

16:36.888 --> 16:39.558
actually, mostly 'cause my mom died.

16:40.892 --> 16:42.435
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

16:42.519 --> 16:46.815
- I'm pretty sure it wasn't your fault.
- Yeah, well, you don't know me.

16:47.524 --> 16:49.484
You don't know what I'm capable of.

16:49.568 --> 16:52.195
Are you the one wandering around,
giving everyone cancer?

16:52.279 --> 16:54.447
Yes. That's me.

16:54.531 --> 16:56.449
- That's you?
- I am Cancer Girl.

16:57.117 --> 17:00.912
Crazy. You're a real bad person.

17:04.540 --> 17:07.252
So how long ago did she pass?

17:10.045 --> 17:11.256
Like a year ago.

17:17.512 --> 17:19.638
As soon as the doctor told her
that she had...

17:20.598 --> 17:22.474
a year or so to live...

17:23.517 --> 17:26.730
she became almost instantly happier.

17:28.481 --> 17:29.858
- What?
- Yeah.

17:30.859 --> 17:32.485
Wait, how is that possible?

17:33.153 --> 17:37.657
I think it's like, as soon as she realized
that she had this limited amount of time,

17:37.741 --> 17:39.242
she just kind of relaxed.

17:39.326 --> 17:41.995
And all the things
that she was worried about in her life...

17:42.078 --> 17:45.290
Like, what was she gonna do
about retirement?

17:45.373 --> 17:50.128
Would she have to sell her house?
Was her relationship going anywhere?

17:50.212 --> 17:55.175
All that stuff just didn't matter anymore.
It was kind of suddenly inconsequential.

17:56.259 --> 18:00.680
The only thing that mattered was
just her happiness in that moment

18:00.764 --> 18:02.432
and what was right in front of her.

18:02.515 --> 18:05.936
And just, like, being alive
while she could, you know?

18:07.938 --> 18:10.190
Anyway, that's where the...

18:11.191 --> 18:13.652
That's where the idea
for the novel first came from.

18:19.741 --> 18:22.202
- Do you wanna do shots?
- Yeah.

18:25.914 --> 18:27.832
- How about that one?
- Oh, F yeah.

18:27.916 --> 18:31.962
I'd totally dance to that shit.
What is that? H-1-4.

18:32.587 --> 18:33.421
What?

18:34.214 --> 18:35.549
- Nothing.
- What?

18:35.632 --> 18:38.385
Nothing. I'm just like, are you real?

18:39.135 --> 18:40.470
Or are you like one of those...

18:42.013 --> 18:44.391
What do you call them?
Manic Pixie Dream Girls.

18:44.474 --> 18:46.810
What, you think I'm here to save you?

18:46.893 --> 18:50.105
I'm just saying, beautiful strangers
don't usually just walk up to me

18:50.188 --> 18:51.815
and ask me to go out for drinks

18:51.898 --> 18:54.484
- and have a great time.
- I don't know anyone in town.

18:55.110 --> 18:58.071
So, you know, I'd be happy
to find another tour guide.

18:58.154 --> 19:02.158
I'm sure any one of these barflies
would love to show me around.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.786
Hey, Slim, do you like Peter Sellers?

19:05.662 --> 19:07.873
We're okay. No, listen. I'm...

19:09.040 --> 19:11.042
Don't get me wrong, okay?
I'm glad you did.

19:11.126 --> 19:13.628
Good! 'Cause that theory's dumb.

19:14.963 --> 19:16.756
All right, all right, all right.

19:17.340 --> 19:19.551
Also, I could have ulterior motives.

19:20.719 --> 19:24.347
- I could totally be using you right now.
- Really? For what?

19:25.432 --> 19:28.476
Quarters, motherfucker. Hand them over.

19:31.354 --> 19:32.731
It's all I got.

19:36.359 --> 19:39.112
Okay, 2-1-2...

19:40.697 --> 19:43.450
My fiancÃ©e left me
after I had some emotional problems,

19:43.533 --> 19:45.535
and now I'm broke
and have to take a crap job

19:45.619 --> 19:49.372
and move into my best friend's garage,
and my life is in total shambles.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.335
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:54.836 --> 19:56.796
That's why I went to the movie today.

19:59.841 --> 20:00.759
Well, then...

20:03.345 --> 20:05.972
I, for one, am really glad you did.

20:07.057 --> 20:07.933
Me too.

20:09.518 --> 20:10.810
Oh, shit.

20:12.562 --> 20:14.189
- Okay.
- What's our motivation?

20:14.272 --> 20:15.857
Frowny faces or, like, sexy...?

20:16.983 --> 20:18.777
I think we're winging it. Here it comes.

20:19.444 --> 20:21.696
- That's too fast.
- They're coming really fast.

20:24.741 --> 20:25.867
What do we do?

20:35.168 --> 20:37.629
Do it. I won't judge.

20:37.712 --> 20:39.965
- Come on. Let it loose.
- This is your thing, not mine.

20:40.048 --> 20:42.634
I know, but I let myself loose,

20:42.717 --> 20:46.638
naked, vulnerable for you, so please,
just give it to me once, real fast.

20:46.721 --> 20:48.598
You talking to me?

20:50.392 --> 20:51.852
Are you talking to me?

20:53.311 --> 20:55.981
That is really bad.

20:56.064 --> 20:59.860
- That is... It's like...
- I told you it's bad.

20:59.943 --> 21:04.072
It's like you're De Niro
but as a slow Saint Bernard.

21:05.574 --> 21:09.494
It's like you're the taxi driver
who had a stroke...

21:10.787 --> 21:14.291
- That's mean.
- ...and got in too many car accidents.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.585
Okay, I will have you know,

21:17.210 --> 21:20.171
I am very good at animal impressions.

21:20.755 --> 21:22.340
- That's exciting.
- Yeah.

21:22.424 --> 21:23.466
Lion. Go.

21:24.759 --> 21:26.720
I wish I could, but this is me.

21:29.431 --> 21:30.265
Jesus.

21:32.142 --> 21:32.976
Okay.

21:35.061 --> 21:36.938
How do I do this? Do I take your number?

21:37.022 --> 21:39.316
- Is that proper etiquette?
- Yeah. Sounds about right.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.318
It's just, I don't have a phone.

21:42.694 --> 21:43.820
Seriously?

21:44.571 --> 21:45.405
Seriously.

21:46.239 --> 21:49.659
Okay. What's going on here?

21:50.452 --> 21:54.039
So you're not from around here,
you don't have an ID,

21:54.122 --> 21:57.042
you're balling around
with huge stacks of cash,

21:57.125 --> 21:58.501
and you don't have a phone?

21:58.585 --> 22:01.338
I mean, are you a hit man or something?

22:01.421 --> 22:04.966
- Oh, no. You found out.
- Seriously. What's...?

22:05.050 --> 22:08.929
- Oh, shit. Do it quickly.
- No, I just broke my phone.

22:10.347 --> 22:11.973
You have to give me your number.

22:14.851 --> 22:15.685
Deal.

22:20.899 --> 22:24.402
- Who are those slobs?
- I don't know. Who are those weirdos?

22:30.450 --> 22:31.284
Cool.

22:32.244 --> 22:33.745
I'll call you sometime.

22:33.828 --> 22:35.038
Yeah, please do.

22:37.958 --> 22:39.209
- Bye.
- Bye.

22:48.301 --> 22:50.095
- Good night.
- Okay, good night.

23:02.566 --> 23:05.861
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You have to kiss her.

23:05.944 --> 23:07.988
In this situation, you have to kiss her.

23:08.071 --> 23:10.031
How many fucking chances
do you get like that?

23:17.038 --> 23:20.083
<i>Hi. Just a quick question.
Is now too soon?</i>

24:02.167 --> 24:03.585
Good night, buddy.

24:06.254 --> 24:07.130
Night.

24:12.886 --> 24:13.803
I met a girl.

24:14.387 --> 24:16.306
I just watched
my son piss in his own mouth.

24:17.849 --> 24:18.767
You wanna come in?

24:18.850 --> 24:20.143
- Sure.
- Cool.

24:20.227 --> 24:25.607
Yeah, man, she's pretty and funny
and smart and just awesome,

24:25.690 --> 24:28.485
and I'm gonna see her again tonight.

24:28.568 --> 24:30.278
Hell, yeah, man.
That's fucking awesome.

24:30.362 --> 24:31.655
Yeah, it is. It is.

24:32.489 --> 24:34.991
- She's a little weird, I guess.
- Weird how?

24:35.075 --> 24:39.788
Well, like, she was walking around
with this huge wad of cash all night.

24:39.871 --> 24:42.415
So is she rich?
That's not weird. That's tight.

24:42.499 --> 24:44.501
She also doesn't have a cell phone.

24:45.460 --> 24:48.713
- She doesn't have a cell phone?
- Yeah, no phone.

24:48.797 --> 24:50.549
Okay, that is fucking weird.

24:50.632 --> 24:53.134
- Is it?
- That is truly bizarre.

24:53.218 --> 24:55.262
- Everyone has a cell phone.
- Not everyone.

24:55.345 --> 24:57.681
- Who doesn't have a phone?
- I don't know.

24:58.181 --> 25:00.600
Members of the Mennonite community
don't have cell phones.

25:00.684 --> 25:02.727
- People in the Mennonite community?
- Yeah.

25:02.811 --> 25:06.690
So she's walking around in a bonnet,
riding on a horse and buggy?

25:06.773 --> 25:09.901
Is that what you're telling me?
She's not a fucking Mennonite. It's weird.

25:09.985 --> 25:11.778
- Even Teddy has a cell phone.
- Seriously?

25:11.862 --> 25:12.863
Yeah.

25:12.946 --> 25:15.740
Yeah, but I guess I'm wondering,
should I be worried?

25:15.824 --> 25:19.369
I don't know, man.
That's a little out of my jurisdiction.

25:19.452 --> 25:21.288
Baby! Rachel!

25:22.080 --> 25:24.541
Oh, my God.
Eve is sleeping, you dum-dum.

25:24.624 --> 25:27.586
- Dum-dum, doo-doo head.
- Yeah. Good one, Teddy.

25:28.253 --> 25:30.213
You go sit over there.
We're gonna make lunch.

25:30.297 --> 25:31.423
Babe, we have a question.

25:31.506 --> 25:35.635
- Is it weird that the girl Bart met...
- Bart met a girl?

25:35.719 --> 25:37.387
- I did.
- That is so awesome.

25:37.470 --> 25:40.223
But is it weird
that she doesn't have a phone?

25:40.932 --> 25:43.351
- Doesn't have a cellular phone?
- Right.

25:43.435 --> 25:45.979
Is she a fake hipster
who plays the ukulele

25:46.062 --> 25:48.023
and wears a trash bag around like a dress?

25:48.106 --> 25:50.233
- I'm too tired for that.
- No, she's not like that.

25:50.317 --> 25:52.527
- She's a really normal, cool girl.
- Okay. Good.

25:52.611 --> 25:54.237
Who just happens to not have a phone.

25:54.321 --> 25:56.406
- Okay, it's still very weird.
- It's rubbing me.

25:56.489 --> 25:57.657
It's rubbing me wrong.

25:57.741 --> 26:00.827
Everyone I know has a cell phone.
My grandma has a cell phone. She's deaf.

26:00.911 --> 26:03.163
"Should I be worried?"
is what I'm wondering.

26:03.246 --> 26:07.584
She's really pretty and really fun,
and I just want something good.

26:07.667 --> 26:10.086
What's her deal?
Where is she from? What does she do?

26:11.296 --> 26:13.006
Not sure.

26:13.089 --> 26:15.050
And I'm not sure.

26:15.133 --> 26:17.385
So you have a very special connection.

26:17.469 --> 26:20.972
We had a connection. We did.
We didn't really talk about that stuff.

26:21.056 --> 26:24.059
You didn't get into it because...?
Were you staring at her boobs

26:24.142 --> 26:27.229
or whatever you guys do
when you think you're making a connection?

26:27.312 --> 26:30.565
- What's wrong with staring at boobs?
- A lot. She's not an object.

26:30.649 --> 26:32.067
This is a woman he's...

26:32.150 --> 26:34.861
- He doesn't know where she's from.
- Fine. You're right.

26:34.945 --> 26:37.572
Honestly, I'm just so glad
you're moving on

26:37.656 --> 26:41.076
because I really liked Whit,
but that was unhealthy.

26:41.159 --> 26:43.036
- Amen. Damn right.
- Unhealthy.

26:43.119 --> 26:45.247
- I'm just happy to see you smiling again.
- Yeah.

26:45.330 --> 26:47.666
But mostly, I'm happy you got laid.

26:47.749 --> 26:51.753
You got laid? Oh, this is fantastic.
I'm so happy for you.

26:51.836 --> 26:54.339
Hey, Teddy. Uncle Bart got laid.

26:55.840 --> 26:57.884
<i>Uncle Bart got laid</i>

26:57.968 --> 26:59.970
<i>Uncle Bart got laid</i>

27:02.138 --> 27:04.266
<i>Uncle Bart got
Got laid</i>

27:24.119 --> 27:26.121
<i>Hey, B, I'm sorry that I keep calling.</i>

27:26.204 --> 27:28.540
<i>I'm really trying
to give you space, I swear.</i>

27:28.623 --> 27:30.417
<i>But I got another message
from your doctor.</i>

27:30.500 --> 27:32.544
<i>I was starting to worry a little,</i>

27:32.627 --> 27:35.422
<i>so, you know, give them or me a call.</i>

27:35.505 --> 27:36.715
<i>Okay? I just...</i>

27:43.680 --> 27:45.098
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:46.266 --> 27:49.102
- You look great.
- Thank you. So do you.

27:49.186 --> 27:50.187
Oh, thank you.

27:50.270 --> 27:52.856
I was totally fishing
for that compliment, so...

27:52.939 --> 27:55.609
I bet. There's always something with you.

27:57.360 --> 27:58.445
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:00.822 --> 28:03.158
- Shall we?
- Yeah, let's.

28:08.079 --> 28:09.998
You're not a Mennonite, are you?

28:10.707 --> 28:11.541
What?

28:12.083 --> 28:12.918
Nothing.

28:28.892 --> 28:30.310
It's pretty incredible.

28:32.354 --> 28:33.188
I'll say.

28:42.239 --> 28:43.823
<i>What's Beethoven's favorite fruit?</i>

28:43.907 --> 28:46.243
I don't know.
What is Beethoven's favorite fruit?

28:46.326 --> 28:50.622
<i>Ba-na-na-na
Ba-na-na-na</i>

28:52.457 --> 28:54.543
Oh, my God.
That is way too big of a laugh.

28:54.626 --> 28:57.712
- That is a stupid, old dad joke.
- It's really funny.

28:57.796 --> 28:59.256
You love the dad jokes.

29:00.715 --> 29:04.469
I can't believe you've never heard that.
That's an old standby.

29:04.553 --> 29:06.972
Well, it just slipped through the cracks.

29:09.724 --> 29:13.311
So tell me stuff. I feel like
I didn't really get the scoop last time.

29:13.395 --> 29:16.481
What do you do?
Where are you from? Why are you here?

29:16.565 --> 29:17.399
Okay.

29:19.025 --> 29:19.860
Oh, man.

29:20.402 --> 29:22.487
I work for this government agency,

29:23.488 --> 29:26.408
and I am from up north.

29:27.742 --> 29:30.036
Cool, cool. That's all super vague.

29:30.120 --> 29:32.455
It's just really freaking boring.

29:34.833 --> 29:35.876
Continue.

29:37.627 --> 29:41.298
I came to town to...
I don't know why I came to town.

29:41.381 --> 29:43.884
I came to town to, I guess, escape.

29:44.718 --> 29:45.594
Escape what?

29:47.053 --> 29:47.929
Everything.

29:48.597 --> 29:51.892
Work. Life. My mom.

29:52.475 --> 29:55.687
I take it you and your mom have
a stellar relationship?

29:55.770 --> 29:57.022
Actually, we do.

29:57.814 --> 29:59.316
Yeah. She's just sick.

30:01.151 --> 30:04.279
- Shit. Sorry.
- Don't be. It's not your fault.

30:05.238 --> 30:06.781
It's my fault. Remember?

30:07.449 --> 30:11.494
- Cancer Girl.
- Fuck. Cancer Girl strikes again.

30:12.120 --> 30:12.954
Yeah.

30:13.788 --> 30:15.207
Is it...? Is it bad?

30:15.957 --> 30:16.958
It's not good.

30:17.918 --> 30:19.961
But it's mostly just exhausting.

30:21.213 --> 30:25.342
So I thought getting away
for a little bit might be good.

30:26.968 --> 30:30.055
Look at us having so much in common,
with our cancer moms.

30:30.138 --> 30:31.348
I know, right?

30:33.266 --> 30:34.351
Yeah.

30:34.434 --> 30:39.481
I remember my mom talking about
what L.A. was like before I was born.

30:40.815 --> 30:43.485
And how she loved it so much.

30:43.568 --> 30:47.656
How it seemed so romantic
and full of opportunity.

30:48.406 --> 30:51.409
So... I just wanted to see it.

30:53.036 --> 30:54.496
It is awfully pretty.

30:57.040 --> 30:57.874
Yeah.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.669
And so different now.

31:03.255 --> 31:04.339
Different from what?

31:07.133 --> 31:10.679
Just from like...
how I envisioned it, I guess.

31:13.890 --> 31:15.851
- I got it.
- No, I got it.

31:15.934 --> 31:16.768
No, it's fine.

31:21.940 --> 31:24.150
- Okay, what's going on here?
- I'm paying.

31:24.234 --> 31:26.444
But that's gotta be like $10,000.

31:26.528 --> 31:29.906
- I didn't wanna leave it in the hotel.
- Why do you even have it?

31:29.990 --> 31:33.493
I'm sorry. You're vague with your answers,
you don't have a phone...

31:33.577 --> 31:35.203
I don't wanna beat a dead horse here,

31:35.287 --> 31:37.622
but I'm legit
getting a little bit freaked out.

31:37.706 --> 31:39.833
- What's going on?
- It's complicated.

31:39.916 --> 31:41.835
You have to do better than that.

31:41.918 --> 31:46.047
I'm having a great time with you,
but I'm just getting back on my feet.

31:46.131 --> 31:48.383
I can't handle any crazy shit.

31:48.466 --> 31:51.553
- Okay. Let's talk about it.
- I'm serious. I'll leave.

31:51.636 --> 31:53.430
I just don't wanna talk about it here.

31:55.140 --> 31:55.974
Okay.

31:57.267 --> 31:58.393
Okay.

32:11.031 --> 32:13.533
- I love hummingbirds.
- Yeah. They're great.

32:14.201 --> 32:17.662
We're back in my apartment now,
away from the crowds of people, so...

32:19.331 --> 32:20.165
shoot.

32:26.796 --> 32:27.631
Well...

32:30.926 --> 32:35.805
Oh, my God. Am I about to wake up
in a tub full of ice without a kidney?

32:35.889 --> 32:38.516
No. It's nothing like that.

32:39.142 --> 32:39.976
It's just...

32:44.523 --> 32:46.858
Buddy, come on.
The suspense is killing me here.

32:46.942 --> 32:50.111
- Just tell me what's going on.
- It's just that...

32:50.195 --> 32:51.988
Just tell me. You're married.

32:52.072 --> 32:54.366
- No.
- You're on the run from the law.

32:54.449 --> 32:56.660
- No.
- You killed a man in Texas.

32:56.743 --> 32:59.996
No, it's not...
It's not like that. It's that...

33:00.080 --> 33:01.373
Just tell me what the deal is.

33:01.456 --> 33:04.459
- I mean, I'm here for you.
- I'm trying to tell you.

33:04.543 --> 33:06.962
I'm from the future. I'm from the future!

33:12.384 --> 33:14.302
Okay. That makes total sense.

33:16.054 --> 33:17.556
I am from...

33:22.644 --> 33:24.229
Oh, my God. You're crazy.

33:28.358 --> 33:29.693
Fuck, man.

33:30.902 --> 33:32.821
Why couldn't you just have taken a kidney?

33:32.904 --> 33:36.616
I know it sounds crazy,
but I'm being serious.

33:36.700 --> 33:40.161
Cool, cool, cool.
So you're like from the year 4000?

33:40.245 --> 33:42.330
- No, that's ridiculous.
- Agreed.

33:42.414 --> 33:45.250
- I'm from 2052.
- Okay, time to go.

33:45.333 --> 33:47.544
- I work for a division of the NSA.
- Good for you.

33:47.627 --> 33:50.171
- That's a cool job.
- It is nice, actually.

33:50.255 --> 33:52.257
I have dental and vision,
and that's something

33:52.340 --> 33:54.634
because our health-care system
is really fucked.

33:54.718 --> 33:56.678
Yeah. So is ours. Time to go now.

33:56.761 --> 33:58.889
Would you please listen to me? Just...

34:00.056 --> 34:02.851
Would you... hear me out?

34:04.686 --> 34:05.645
Please.

34:08.480 --> 34:09.315
Fine.

34:12.527 --> 34:13.612
Okay.

34:15.572 --> 34:20.034
No one really knows about our branch.
It's kind of a secret division.

34:20.993 --> 34:25.331
We're a research lab supposedly studying
the transference of matter,

34:25.415 --> 34:28.500
but what we really do is
the study of space and time.

34:30.045 --> 34:33.589
A while ago, they figured out
how to actually transcend time.

34:33.672 --> 34:37.219
So, since then,
we've been making changes to the past

34:37.302 --> 34:40.096
to slightly alter our present
for the better.

34:40.179 --> 34:42.264
- Or that's the goal, at least.
- So what?

34:42.348 --> 34:45.393
You go back and... kill Hitler,
that kind of thing?

34:45.476 --> 34:48.313
No, you can't do big things like that.
It's more like...

34:49.522 --> 34:51.107
- <i>Back to the Future.</i>
- Oh, really?

34:51.190 --> 34:53.150
You know the movie <i>Back to the Future?</i>

34:53.235 --> 34:56.487
Yeah, it's a classic.
You know <i>Casablanca,</i> don't you?

34:57.239 --> 34:59.366
- That makes sense but still...
- Look.

34:59.449 --> 35:02.035
You can't go back
and prohibit your parents from going

35:02.118 --> 35:06.248
to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance
or you might actually just disappear.

35:06.331 --> 35:10.210
But if you make small,
almost imperceptible shifts,

35:10.293 --> 35:13.672
you can change
your present slightly for the better.

35:13.755 --> 35:15.090
Okay, like what?

35:15.173 --> 35:18.426
Like the fact that anyone gives even
a bit of a shit about climate change?

35:18.510 --> 35:21.429
- That is us.
- So, what are you here to do?

35:21.513 --> 35:24.391
Am I super important
in the future or something?

35:24.474 --> 35:26.393
Oh, my God. Someone's got an inflated ego.

35:26.476 --> 35:28.770
Believe me, I don't.
That's a thing from <i>Bill and Ted's.</i>

35:28.854 --> 35:31.773
- Who are Bill and Ted?
- Oh, so that's not a classic?

35:31.857 --> 35:34.359
Look, I am not even here for that.

35:35.652 --> 35:39.322
I'm not technically even supposed
to be allowed to jump, but...

35:45.287 --> 35:46.872
My mom is really...

35:50.792 --> 35:52.168
She really is sick.

35:55.297 --> 35:58.592
And she's broke,
and I don't have the money to help her.

36:01.553 --> 36:03.096
So the idea was to...

36:04.723 --> 36:08.727
buy a few stocks,
put them in a safety-deposit box,

36:09.352 --> 36:13.315
and they'd be worth enough
to help her when I get back.

36:14.441 --> 36:17.360
And I didn't tell anybody about this,
and it was supposed to be quick,

36:17.444 --> 36:21.656
and I didn't expect to meet someone,
and then I did, and you're...

36:24.659 --> 36:25.493
great.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.999
And now I don't know what to do.

36:36.671 --> 36:37.923
Oh, my God.

36:40.175 --> 36:41.259
This is just...

36:43.720 --> 36:45.513
This is... Fuck.

36:46.389 --> 36:49.684
I... I'm sorry. Do you want me to go?

36:50.477 --> 36:51.436
Yes.

36:53.522 --> 36:54.481
No.

36:55.899 --> 36:59.986
I don't know. This is just...
It's a lot, you know?

37:00.070 --> 37:00.946
Yeah.

37:24.594 --> 37:29.516
This is from one of my favorite bands,
and they're called Long Weekend.

37:29.599 --> 37:32.602
And the song came out
when I was in college

37:32.686 --> 37:35.647
and I just always sort of loved it.

37:37.357 --> 37:38.233
So...

37:43.905 --> 37:47.075
<i>Stars in flight</i>

37:48.827 --> 37:51.538
<i>Forever tonight</i>

37:52.372 --> 37:54.040
<i>Forever tonight</i>

37:56.877 --> 37:59.796
<i>Shine so bright</i>

38:01.047 --> 38:03.967
<i>Forever tonight</i>

38:04.759 --> 38:06.511
<i>Forever tonight</i>

38:08.513 --> 38:12.392
<i>Tell me how you know
How you know, how you know</i>

38:12.475 --> 38:16.229
<i>Tell me how you know
How you know, how you know</i>

38:16.313 --> 38:18.607
<i>That nothing lasts forever</i>

38:19.983 --> 38:22.986
<i>Nothing lasts forever</i>

38:23.612 --> 38:27.324
<i>Tell me how you know
How you know, how you know</i>

38:27.407 --> 38:30.952
<i>Tell me how you know
How you know, how you know</i>

38:31.036 --> 38:33.330
<i>That it's too late</i>

38:34.873 --> 38:41.129
<i>Because my heart won't wait forever</i>

38:43.173 --> 38:48.094
<i>Constellations above me</i>

38:49.095 --> 38:51.139
<i>Where did you go?</i>

38:52.515 --> 38:55.644
<i>Where did you go?</i>

38:57.395 --> 39:02.609
<i>Hold on if you still love me</i>

39:03.401 --> 39:05.779
<i>How will I know?</i>

39:06.905 --> 39:09.866
<i>How will I know?</i>

39:10.575 --> 39:13.078
<i>So tell me how you know
How you...</i>

39:37.352 --> 39:38.728
Hello.

39:40.897 --> 39:41.731
Hey.

39:57.163 --> 39:59.332
So listen...

40:02.752 --> 40:04.170
I really like you...

40:06.298 --> 40:11.177
but I can only stay here
for a little bit before I have to...

40:12.429 --> 40:13.471
get back.

40:16.349 --> 40:18.727
So can we just...

40:19.811 --> 40:21.188
maybe enjoy this?

40:22.647 --> 40:24.649
- Just enjoy this?
- Yeah.

40:28.904 --> 40:29.738
Okay.

40:30.280 --> 40:31.323
Great.

40:36.912 --> 40:39.414
So now that we got that out of the way...

40:41.333 --> 40:44.085
I need your help with something first.

40:46.296 --> 40:49.424
- So why this place?
- 'Cause it's not going anywhere.

40:50.133 --> 40:53.053
- Just the one safety-deposit box?
- That's right.

40:53.136 --> 40:55.555
- Yes, please.
- And will it be in your name?

40:55.639 --> 41:00.185
In my name, but I'd like to make sure
that she has access to the box as well.

41:00.268 --> 41:03.146
- Of course. I'll just need your license.
- Sure.

41:07.609 --> 41:11.821
Okay. Now if you could
just fill this out right here.

41:26.836 --> 41:28.630
All right. And this is yours.

41:30.215 --> 41:31.466
I'll leave you to it.

41:32.717 --> 41:33.885
Thank you so much.

41:40.058 --> 41:40.892
Well?

41:41.476 --> 41:42.310
Right.

41:51.820 --> 41:52.696
Hyundai?

41:53.947 --> 41:54.990
Really?

41:55.073 --> 41:56.074
Oh, yeah.

42:01.538 --> 42:02.372
So...

42:04.165 --> 42:05.333
you did have...

42:06.418 --> 42:08.128
ulterior motives here.

42:09.838 --> 42:14.968
Kind of. Yes, it's true.
I had to find somebody with an ID.

42:15.051 --> 42:18.346
Okay, so I'm just somebody
with an ID to you?

42:18.430 --> 42:21.391
No, of course not.
I could have found anyone.

42:22.100 --> 42:25.520
There's a reason I came to you.

42:25.604 --> 42:27.397
I was drunk and sleepy?

42:28.481 --> 42:31.693
Exactly. You were a very easy target.

42:34.112 --> 42:36.072
But, really, why me?

42:36.156 --> 42:37.616
Oh, buddy.

42:38.491 --> 42:39.492
There are...

42:40.452 --> 42:42.454
a lot of reasons, okay?

42:44.247 --> 42:48.376
But just know
that I was drawn to you and I still am.

42:53.798 --> 42:55.425
Okay. I can live with that.

42:55.508 --> 42:56.760
- Okay?
- Yeah.

42:57.552 --> 42:59.387
- Okay.
- So what now?

43:00.764 --> 43:01.806
Well, we could...

43:02.474 --> 43:03.308
Sex?

43:04.226 --> 43:05.143
Okay.

43:09.689 --> 43:11.191
Oh, my God.

43:13.193 --> 43:14.027
<i>Okay.</i>

43:15.695 --> 43:18.532
I would like to see... a bear.

43:27.499 --> 43:29.918
This bear is a terrible kisser.

43:30.752 --> 43:34.172
Keep going.
Keep your eyes closed. Eyes closed.

43:34.256 --> 43:35.465
And stop.

43:36.633 --> 43:38.009
Now come to me.

43:39.594 --> 43:40.804
I know you're close.

43:40.887 --> 43:42.931
- A snake.
- A snake.

43:43.014 --> 43:46.017
- How do I do a snake?
- That's kind of a you problem.

43:46.101 --> 43:47.644
That's how it is, huh?

43:51.314 --> 43:53.984
- That's not a snake.
- That's for sure a snake.

43:54.067 --> 43:55.610
- Push, push, push.
- I am.

43:55.694 --> 43:56.695
Hard. Hard.

43:56.778 --> 43:59.239
Three, two... Okay, step out.

43:59.322 --> 44:00.866
Just let your arms go.

44:04.452 --> 44:06.538
Don't you have door frames in the future?

44:06.621 --> 44:09.624
Yeah, but this is gonna blow
their fucking minds.

44:09.708 --> 44:12.002
And stop.

44:12.085 --> 44:12.961
Oh, shit.

44:13.837 --> 44:15.088
What's that thing?

44:15.171 --> 44:18.383
This is a rattlesnake, and it is its tail.

44:26.641 --> 44:27.809
I can see.

44:32.147 --> 44:34.399
Oh, God! Jesus.

44:50.582 --> 44:52.792
So how long do you have?

44:56.838 --> 44:58.089
Just a little bit.

44:59.299 --> 45:00.425
Not long enough.

45:06.389 --> 45:09.726
It's just, you know,
it gets tricky if you stay too long.

45:11.228 --> 45:12.062
Right.

45:15.815 --> 45:17.943
The fucking future?

45:18.026 --> 45:19.319
Yeah, 2052.

45:19.402 --> 45:22.197
- We have time travel in 2052?
- Not all of us.

45:22.280 --> 45:25.408
She works for a secret branch
of the NSA or something.

45:25.492 --> 45:27.869
That "or something"
is that this chick is crazy.

45:27.953 --> 45:30.580
I thought so too, but then she...

45:31.957 --> 45:35.377
- She kind of convinced me.
- How? How?

45:35.460 --> 45:37.420
She sang this song from her favorite band.

45:38.004 --> 45:39.214
And?

45:39.297 --> 45:41.800
And it was a song
I had never heard before.

45:42.801 --> 45:46.513
That's it? She didn't even try the whole
"Future Biff convincing Past Biff

45:46.596 --> 45:48.682
he was real by telling him
the outcome of a game"?

45:48.765 --> 45:51.852
No, I thought she would,
but it was mostly just a song.

45:51.935 --> 45:53.687
Do you understand how easy it is
to come up with a song?

45:53.770 --> 45:57.482
- It's that not easy.
- It is so easy. I will do it right now.

45:57.566 --> 45:59.901
<i>I got my flip-flop
I got my tip-top</i>

45:59.985 --> 46:02.737
<i>I got my...
Summer love</i>

46:03.363 --> 46:05.907
Now I'm from the fucking future.
Worship me.

46:06.491 --> 46:09.828
- It was better than that.
- That was pretty good, right?

46:09.911 --> 46:13.123
- Wasn't bad.
- Dude, come on. Flip-flops, summer love?

46:13.748 --> 46:15.166
That was off the top of my dome.

46:15.250 --> 46:17.377
- I know. I understand.
- It was catchy.

46:17.460 --> 46:19.337
Like "I might have missed
my calling" catchy.

46:19.421 --> 46:21.131
It was more than just a song, all right?

46:21.214 --> 46:25.468
She was also just really specific
and really normal and really sane.

46:25.552 --> 46:28.513
And I can't explain why,

46:28.597 --> 46:30.974
but I really do believe her.

46:32.017 --> 46:32.934
I mean...

46:34.436 --> 46:35.937
it could be true.

46:36.021 --> 46:40.609
Dude, no one is happier than me
that you're getting your beak wet, okay?

46:40.692 --> 46:44.279
- I am thrilled. With all that Whit stuff...
- Don't bring that up.

46:44.362 --> 46:47.407
After all the Whit stuff
and the treatment...

46:47.490 --> 46:49.659
- It's not that. I'm fine.
- ...and all of that...

46:49.743 --> 46:51.620
I know you are.
I'm just saying that maybe

46:51.703 --> 46:53.997
this isn't the right thing
for you to get involved in.

46:54.080 --> 46:59.544
Maybe you need something
a little more stable, you know?

47:01.296 --> 47:02.130
Timmy Emerson.

47:03.006 --> 47:05.550
Normal response. What about him?

47:05.634 --> 47:07.427
- Do you remember him?
- Yes, I remember him.

47:07.510 --> 47:09.638
He was a cancer kid from school.
Who cares?

47:09.721 --> 47:12.390
In fourth grade, he was diagnosed
with stage 4 leukemia.

47:12.474 --> 47:15.810
I know. His Make-A-Wish was
to go to a live taping of <i>Full House.</i>

47:15.894 --> 47:17.103
I was super jealous of that.

47:17.187 --> 47:20.440
That fall, the doctors told his parents
treatments weren't working.

47:20.524 --> 47:23.735
He wouldn't live past Christmas.
Christmas came. Timmy was still here.

47:23.818 --> 47:26.905
And then it was spring.
Timmy was still around. He seemed fine.

47:26.988 --> 47:29.699
And then his parents took him
for a checkup

47:29.783 --> 47:32.118
and the cancer was just gone, you know?

47:32.202 --> 47:34.996
- I mean, that's fucking crazy.
- Yeah.

47:35.080 --> 47:37.707
If that's a thing
that happened in the world,

47:37.791 --> 47:39.751
then why can't she be from the future?

47:40.377 --> 47:43.838
Because those are
two completely different things.

47:43.922 --> 47:48.426
But it's not though. It's inexplicable,
but it still happened, you know?

47:48.510 --> 47:51.429
It's a crazy fucking thing,
and it still happened.

47:51.513 --> 47:54.307
I mean, it's possible, is all I'm saying.

47:55.767 --> 47:56.601
Yeah.

47:57.978 --> 48:00.397
- You know, it happened.
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.

48:02.023 --> 48:03.817
Okay, buddy. Look.

48:06.027 --> 48:07.028
I get it.

48:08.154 --> 48:09.030
I do.

48:09.573 --> 48:12.534
I know it's hard to recognize

48:13.159 --> 48:15.370
when someone you care about is sick.

48:15.954 --> 48:18.748
- I saw it with you.
- Oh, my God. This isn't that.

48:18.832 --> 48:21.918
I know, this is different. I get it. Okay?

48:22.002 --> 48:26.089
But it seems like something's going on
with this girl, right?

48:26.172 --> 48:28.592
And I know it's scary
when you see someone

48:28.675 --> 48:30.844
that you know really well start
to come unglued.

48:30.927 --> 48:33.430
She isn't me, okay?
This is very different.

48:33.513 --> 48:36.975
Yes. Can you just sit down?

48:37.058 --> 48:38.518
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

48:38.602 --> 48:40.145
- Don't treat me like that.
- I'm...

48:40.729 --> 48:42.772
I just don't wanna see you
take steps backwards.

48:42.856 --> 48:45.734
- I don't want your fucking help, Doug.
- Barty.

48:46.943 --> 48:47.777
Bart...

48:56.077 --> 48:57.829
- Okay, I'm ready.
- Okay.

48:57.913 --> 49:00.332
Just keep in mind
I haven't done this in a while.

49:00.415 --> 49:03.043
- Understood. No judgment.
- Okay.

49:03.126 --> 49:04.169
- Ready?
- Yep.

49:05.795 --> 49:06.630
Hit it.

50:06.940 --> 50:08.066
Okay.

50:10.527 --> 50:11.403
That's it.

50:12.904 --> 50:14.573
- Bravo!
- Thank you.

50:14.656 --> 50:17.075
- Encore!
- Okay. No.

50:18.118 --> 50:20.245
That was really something.

50:20.829 --> 50:22.247
Okay, it is your turn.

50:22.330 --> 50:24.749
No, I can't compete with that.

50:24.833 --> 50:27.919
- I was never in a dance recital.
- Well, too bad.

50:28.003 --> 50:30.672
You're gonna have to figure out
something to show me.

50:34.342 --> 50:35.260
Yeah, this way.

50:39.681 --> 50:42.893
Okay, so when I was having my problems,

50:42.976 --> 50:46.438
my doctor said it would be good
to have a physical outlet of some kind,

50:46.521 --> 50:48.064
so I started doing this.

50:48.148 --> 50:50.192
Is this an exercise class or something?

50:50.275 --> 50:52.068
- No.
- What is it?

50:52.736 --> 50:53.570
You'll see.

51:00.368 --> 51:01.244
What?

51:05.290 --> 51:06.917
It's dancing in the dark.

51:07.918 --> 51:11.421
Don't think about anything.
Just dance and sweat and...

51:12.339 --> 51:13.298
go crazy.

51:57.300 --> 52:00.595
<i>If you're really from the future,
you'll have to give me some specifics.</i>

52:00.679 --> 52:03.682
<i>Like... are we all doomed?</i>

52:03.765 --> 52:06.476
<i>Does George Martin
ever finish those books?</i>

52:06.560 --> 52:09.771
<i>Do the Pirates win the World Series? Ever?</i>

52:11.022 --> 52:14.776
<i>I don't know offhand.
I'm not a sports almanac.</i>

52:14.860 --> 52:17.112
<i>Then I don't know
if I believe you. How about that?</i>

52:17.195 --> 52:19.656
<i>Oh, really? Seriously?</i>

52:19.739 --> 52:22.742
<i>Yeah, you tell me you've unlocked
the secrets of time travel,</i>

52:22.826 --> 52:25.704
<i>but all I have to go off
is a song you sang me</i>

52:25.787 --> 52:27.998
<i>and your wildly charming disposition.</i>

52:28.915 --> 52:32.627
<i>Look, it isn't a good idea for me
to get into specifics.</i>

52:33.628 --> 52:35.005
<i>But I can tell you</i>

52:35.088 --> 52:39.217
<i>that someone as pale as you
is definitely the minority now.</i>

52:40.343 --> 52:43.805
<i>Otherwise, I don't know.
I guess it's not that different.</i>

52:43.889 --> 52:46.182
<i>It's hotter and drier in some places.</i>

52:46.975 --> 52:50.353
<i>Colder and wetter in others.
There are more extremes.</i>

52:52.856 --> 52:55.233
<i>There's still conflict and wars,</i>

52:55.317 --> 52:58.111
<i>and most think it's worse
than it's ever been,</i>

52:58.820 --> 53:00.906
<i>but I'm not sure it's so different.</i>

53:02.532 --> 53:06.411
<i>'Cause at the end of the day,
people still want the same things.</i>

53:06.494 --> 53:10.790
<i>Still wanna have good jobs,
go on vacation, see the world,</i>

53:11.458 --> 53:14.920
<i>get drunk, get married, get a dog,</i>

53:15.003 --> 53:17.339
<i>buy a house, have some kids.</i>

53:18.298 --> 53:21.551
<i>We all still wanna feel valued and happy</i>

53:21.635 --> 53:26.473
<i>but are confused when we get
all the things we want but still don't.</i>

53:27.974 --> 53:31.228
<i>I guess we're all still messy
and flawed and confused</i>

53:31.311 --> 53:33.730
<i>but just trying to do the best we can.</i>

53:34.439 --> 53:37.108
<i>Just trying to find love.</i>

53:43.323 --> 53:44.616
Does that make sense?

53:46.409 --> 53:47.410
I think so.

53:51.331 --> 53:55.961
You're not gonna give me a little hint
about the Pirates in the World Series?

53:56.044 --> 53:58.421
Oh, my God, give it up.

53:58.505 --> 54:00.257
That'd be too much.

54:01.091 --> 54:04.553
But I will tell you about this one time
when I was a little girl,

54:05.637 --> 54:07.889
maybe 6 or something,

54:07.973 --> 54:10.267
there was this huge meteor shower.

54:11.142 --> 54:15.313
And it was the biggest one in over
like a thousand years or something,

54:15.397 --> 54:18.024
and my dad really wanted
to watch it with me.

54:18.108 --> 54:22.487
So we drove out
to a desert like this one...

54:23.780 --> 54:27.909
because he loved the desert
when he was alive.

54:33.081 --> 54:34.875
I guess he's alive right now.

54:42.924 --> 54:45.635
So we packed up these snacks...

54:47.429 --> 54:48.930
and hot chocolate,

54:50.056 --> 54:53.768
and we drove to the desert
and sat on a hill like this one.

54:55.645 --> 54:59.774
And the showers weren't supposed
to start till the middle of the night.

55:01.276 --> 55:05.363
So I felt super cool 'cause I got
to stay up late and drink hot cocoa.

55:06.865 --> 55:11.995
But then, eventually, I fell asleep
on his shoulder and he woke me up.

55:13.121 --> 55:17.083
He nudged me a little
and he said, "Hey, sweet pea, look up."

55:18.877 --> 55:20.420
And above us was...

55:22.422 --> 55:24.633
just a brilliant sight.

55:25.425 --> 55:30.180
Thousands of meteors
streaking through the sky,

55:30.263 --> 55:35.268
white and purple, blues, green...

55:36.603 --> 55:40.148
It was like the sky had just exploded

55:40.232 --> 55:44.027
into this amazing celestial dance.

55:48.990 --> 55:52.452
And it was just the most beautiful sight
I've ever seen.

55:56.915 --> 55:58.708
Can you imagine such a thing?

56:03.088 --> 56:03.964
I can.

56:09.761 --> 56:12.138
So don't miss it. Okay?

56:15.517 --> 56:16.434
Okay.

56:58.894 --> 56:59.769
Hello?

57:26.838 --> 57:27.756
Vienna?

57:41.770 --> 57:42.812
There you are.

57:55.200 --> 57:56.576
Hey. Buddy.

58:03.333 --> 58:04.251
You okay?

58:08.380 --> 58:09.923
Yeah. Morning.

58:10.632 --> 58:11.550
Morning.

58:13.426 --> 58:15.220
- Hi.
- Hi.

58:16.596 --> 58:17.806
Yeah, I'm good.

58:18.682 --> 58:21.268
Do you wanna hit the road?

58:21.351 --> 58:22.686
Maybe get some coffee?

58:24.187 --> 58:25.230
Yeah, sure.

58:26.648 --> 58:27.732
Okay.

58:52.257 --> 58:53.300
Home sweet home.

58:54.634 --> 58:55.468
Yeah.

59:10.942 --> 59:11.818
Hey.

59:13.945 --> 59:14.863
You okay?

59:17.824 --> 59:18.658
Yeah.

59:19.284 --> 59:20.160
I'm just...

59:21.244 --> 59:22.662
real tired.

59:37.010 --> 59:38.595
Cannonball!

59:38.678 --> 59:42.307
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Did I wake you?

59:43.058 --> 59:44.309
You might have.

59:45.018 --> 59:47.646
Good. Because we've got things
we have to do.

59:47.729 --> 59:49.439
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

59:49.523 --> 59:53.735
I made us a picnic and everything.
So let's go. Come on. Out, out, out.

59:53.818 --> 59:56.321
- Up, up, up. Go, go, go.
- Five minutes.

59:56.404 --> 59:57.447
Okay.

59:57.531 --> 01:00:01.785
Well, then I guess
I could always go for some... butthole.

01:00:01.868 --> 01:00:02.911
No!

01:00:02.994 --> 01:00:05.747
- I want that butt!
- Okay, okay, I'm up, I'm up.

01:00:06.873 --> 01:00:08.792
- A mouse.
- Oh, where?

01:00:08.875 --> 01:00:13.088
Yeah, you see the two ears
and then its little nose right there?

01:00:21.429 --> 01:00:23.932
You know, I'm okay, right?

01:00:26.518 --> 01:00:27.394
Okay.

01:00:28.395 --> 01:00:30.063
Like I'm not crazy.

01:00:30.856 --> 01:00:33.024
Unstable. You know, it's just...

01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:36.152
It's just a thing that happens
when you travel.

01:00:37.571 --> 01:00:40.574
If you're out
of your own time for too long,

01:00:40.657 --> 01:00:46.121
your brain chemistry kind of shifts,
and then you can start feeling...

01:00:47.956 --> 01:00:49.082
untethered.

01:00:50.709 --> 01:00:52.711
That's why I can't stay long.

01:01:01.344 --> 01:01:02.929
Last fall, I...

01:01:04.347 --> 01:01:06.850
I became really anxious about...

01:01:09.019 --> 01:01:10.061
everything.

01:01:10.812 --> 01:01:12.772
Like life in general, I guess.

01:01:13.523 --> 01:01:15.066
I mean, my mom died,

01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:20.322
and things with Whit,
my ex, weren't great.

01:01:20.405 --> 01:01:24.826
And I wasn't getting any work,
and I, like, stopped sleeping,

01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:28.288
and I stopped going out,
and I stopped, like,

01:01:28.371 --> 01:01:30.457
wanting to do anything.

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:35.295
And at some point, I kind of lost touch
with what was real and what wasn't.

01:01:37.923 --> 01:01:38.840
You know?

01:01:41.843 --> 01:01:42.802
Yeah, I do.

01:01:45.889 --> 01:01:48.934
So that's when Doug stepped in
and made me get help.

01:01:49.893 --> 01:01:52.103
And at first I was so pissed at him.

01:01:53.522 --> 01:01:57.567
But looking back, I really...

01:01:59.277 --> 01:02:00.862
I really needed it.

01:02:04.491 --> 01:02:07.077
Just being a person is hard, huh?

01:02:20.590 --> 01:02:21.841
Hold on. Slow down.

01:02:32.185 --> 01:02:33.144
Yeah.

01:02:34.312 --> 01:02:35.730
That's good. What does that mean?

01:02:35.814 --> 01:02:38.817
It means, "I'm very sorry,
but I don't speak Italian very well."

01:02:39.484 --> 01:02:40.402
That's useful.

01:02:40.944 --> 01:02:42.946
- How do you know so much Italian?
- Oh, my God.

01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:45.991
People got really into Italian
after Venice.

01:02:46.074 --> 01:02:47.492
What happened in Venice?

01:02:48.368 --> 01:02:49.953
What do you think happened in Venice?

01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:53.957
What else you got?

01:03:02.382 --> 01:03:03.758
Translation?

01:03:03.842 --> 01:03:08.847
"I am a bad conversationalist
but a superb lover."

01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:12.017
- Yeah.
- Use that one a lot, do you?

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:14.477
- You know, just some basics.
- Right.

01:03:15.312 --> 01:03:16.563
Does this need more salt?

01:03:23.195 --> 01:03:24.154
Okay.

01:03:24.821 --> 01:03:28.033
- We just need more wine and we're good.
- It's in the other room. I'll get it.

01:03:28.909 --> 01:03:30.076
What is the phrase again?

01:03:42.672 --> 01:03:46.927
Vienna, help me. I'm stuck
in a loop with the <i>conversatore.</i>

01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:49.262
We need to start with some basic phrases.

01:03:49.346 --> 01:03:53.516
Like, "Where's the bathroom?"
and "I'm lost" and "Thank you."

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:56.144
'Cause I'm kind of shitting
the bed on this.

01:03:58.313 --> 01:03:59.314
Hey, hey.

01:04:01.525 --> 01:04:02.943
Buddy, what's going on?

01:04:05.862 --> 01:04:06.780
I'm sorry.

01:04:07.364 --> 01:04:08.782
Hey, hey, hey.

01:04:08.865 --> 01:04:12.160
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I'm sorry. I can't...

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:18.416
- I got you.
- I can't stop.

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:20.460
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

01:04:21.836 --> 01:04:25.340
- Take deep breaths.
- I've just stayed too long.

01:04:27.592 --> 01:04:30.053
I don't wanna go.

01:04:30.136 --> 01:04:32.722
- It's okay. We'll figure it out.
- Okay.

01:04:32.806 --> 01:04:36.017
Take deep breaths. It's okay. I got you.

01:04:36.101 --> 01:04:38.353
I just don't know what to do

01:04:38.436 --> 01:04:41.606
because I love you.

01:04:44.192 --> 01:04:45.318
I love you too.

01:04:46.361 --> 01:04:49.823
It's gonna be okay.
We're gonna figure it out. All right?

01:04:51.783 --> 01:04:54.160
It's okay. It's okay.

01:04:55.245 --> 01:04:56.997
You're okay. Okay.

01:04:59.708 --> 01:05:02.085
Hey. It's all right.

01:05:31.489 --> 01:05:35.368
- <i>Hey, you all right?</i>
- Hey. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I just...

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:42.792
I'm sorry for being a dick, man.
I'm really sorry.

01:05:42.876 --> 01:05:44.211
<i>Barty, it's okay, man.</i>

01:05:44.836 --> 01:05:47.088
I just... I don't know...

01:05:49.841 --> 01:05:51.635
I don't know what to do, Doug.

01:05:53.929 --> 01:05:55.388
Just tell me what to do.

01:05:56.890 --> 01:06:00.310
<i>I don't know, man.
I mean, if you really like this girl...</i>

01:06:00.393 --> 01:06:02.604
I do. I do so much.

01:06:02.687 --> 01:06:03.647
<i>Well, then...</i>

01:06:04.439 --> 01:06:05.315
<i>help her.</i>

01:06:06.983 --> 01:06:08.318
<i>You know better than anyone.</i>

01:06:08.401 --> 01:06:11.238
<i>Sometimes we've gotta step in
and help the people we love.</i>

01:06:17.869 --> 01:06:19.037
Yeah, you're right.

01:06:20.705 --> 01:06:21.706
Good advice.

01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:26.211
Thanks, Doug.

01:06:27.629 --> 01:06:30.757
<i>I'm here, man.
Just call if you need anything, okay?</i>

01:06:33.885 --> 01:06:35.971
Will do. You're the best.

01:07:29.941 --> 01:07:32.652
Perfect. Thanks for fitting us in.

01:07:35.697 --> 01:07:37.115
Yeah, that's correct.

01:07:43.663 --> 01:07:46.124
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:07:53.590 --> 01:07:55.091
I have something for us to do.

01:07:58.011 --> 01:07:58.845
Okay.

01:08:08.271 --> 01:08:10.982
It's such a pretty day, isn't it?

01:08:13.276 --> 01:08:15.445
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's really pretty.

01:08:43.138 --> 01:08:44.932
You don't believe me, do you?

01:08:49.062 --> 01:08:53.984
I don't know.
I want to and I'm trying to...

01:08:55.861 --> 01:08:57.444
but I don't know if I can.

01:09:01.615 --> 01:09:03.033
Either way, I...

01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:06.620
I don't wanna lose you.

01:09:10.834 --> 01:09:13.794
And the people inside, they can help.

01:09:13.879 --> 01:09:17.090
They helped me last fall when I...

01:09:19.383 --> 01:09:20.676
came untethered.

01:09:34.064 --> 01:09:37.234
<i>Dr. Wallace, dial 118, please.</i>

01:09:37.319 --> 01:09:40.238
<i>Dr. Wallace, please dial 1-1-8.</i>

01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:49.581
Just talk to the doctor and then we can
go get some food or something.

01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:51.957
Yeah, of course.

01:09:53.376 --> 01:09:55.879
It's no big deal.
He just refers you to someone else.

01:09:55.962 --> 01:09:59.591
You just sort of tell him what's going on
and then he makes an assessment,

01:09:59.674 --> 01:10:01.593
and then that's it.

01:10:02.552 --> 01:10:03.678
Low pressure.

01:10:04.638 --> 01:10:06.264
Nice. I like low pressure.

01:10:09.559 --> 01:10:10.894
I'll be here the whole time.

01:10:12.646 --> 01:10:13.855
We're ready for you.

01:10:18.610 --> 01:10:19.486
Okay.

01:10:23.073 --> 01:10:25.367
Hey, it's gonna be fine.

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:27.494
Yeah.

01:10:36.545 --> 01:10:37.963
Hey, you.

01:10:38.046 --> 01:10:39.297
I love you.

01:10:41.174 --> 01:10:42.592
And that's real, okay?

01:10:43.176 --> 01:10:45.971
So you just remember that.

01:10:47.514 --> 01:10:50.100
That this will always be real.

01:10:51.434 --> 01:10:52.644
Okay, buddy?

01:10:53.603 --> 01:10:54.771
Okay, buddy.

01:10:57.399 --> 01:10:58.567
I love you too.

01:11:26.261 --> 01:11:27.429
Sir, are you okay?

01:11:30.181 --> 01:11:31.057
Sir!

01:11:53.288 --> 01:11:55.332
Nurse, he's awake.
Can we have someone in here?

01:11:56.208 --> 01:11:57.042
Thank you.

01:11:58.543 --> 01:11:59.628
Hey, pal.

01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:05.634
All right. Welcome back. How you feeling?

01:12:06.218 --> 01:12:08.595
You've been in and out for a while now.

01:12:08.678 --> 01:12:10.096
I've got a bad headache.

01:12:12.015 --> 01:12:13.391
Yeah, that makes sense.

01:12:13.475 --> 01:12:16.436
If you push that button,
you can get a little hit of morphine.

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:19.689
I asked for one too,
but they were like, "Nah."

01:12:20.732 --> 01:12:22.067
What's going on, Doug?

01:12:22.150 --> 01:12:24.945
What is going on?
A lot is actually going on.

01:12:25.028 --> 01:12:28.406
I mean, the doctors will explain this
way better than me,

01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:29.658
way bigger words,

01:12:29.741 --> 01:12:34.371
but you had a tumor sitting
on your brain, pal.

01:12:35.664 --> 01:12:37.832
They said that you're incredibly lucky

01:12:37.916 --> 01:12:40.085
that you were at the hospital
when it ruptured

01:12:40.168 --> 01:12:41.461
or you wouldn't have made it.

01:12:44.089 --> 01:12:47.217
But they... They got it?

01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:49.553
- Yeah, they operated on you.
- They got it out?

01:12:49.636 --> 01:12:51.930
Got it all out. Scooped it out.

01:12:52.013 --> 01:12:54.349
They said you'll be good as new
in a couple of days.

01:12:54.432 --> 01:12:56.017
Well, that's good.

01:12:58.353 --> 01:13:01.481
Yeah, it's really good, man.
It's really good.

01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:04.150
- Yeah.
- Jesus.

01:13:04.234 --> 01:13:05.443
Yeah, it's a lot.

01:13:10.115 --> 01:13:11.616
Where's Vienna?

01:13:15.871 --> 01:13:17.455
Okay. So...

01:13:18.957 --> 01:13:23.128
So oftentimes when someone has a tumor

01:13:23.211 --> 01:13:25.589
pressed against their brain
like you did,

01:13:26.756 --> 01:13:30.594
apparently, it can affect the way
that they process information.

01:13:30.677 --> 01:13:33.597
Right. But where is she?

01:13:36.641 --> 01:13:38.560
Bart, can we wait
for the doctor to get here?

01:13:38.643 --> 01:13:40.437
No, just tell me where she is.

01:13:41.104 --> 01:13:44.774
- I'd rather the doctor explain.
- Where is she? Just tell me.

01:13:48.612 --> 01:13:50.447
She's not real, Bart.

01:13:52.532 --> 01:13:54.284
I tried to track her down.

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:57.287
I couldn't find anything.

01:13:57.370 --> 01:14:00.582
None of her stuff is
at your apartment or at the hotel.

01:14:00.665 --> 01:14:03.835
Yeah. Yes, it is.
What are you talking about?

01:14:03.919 --> 01:14:07.797
I know it sounds impossible,
but the doctor said that this can happen.

01:14:07.881 --> 01:14:08.882
This isn't funny.

01:14:10.050 --> 01:14:11.134
Give me my phone.

01:14:11.885 --> 01:14:14.679
- I already checked that. It's not...
- Give me my phone, Doug.

01:14:28.735 --> 01:14:29.778
What the fuck?

01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:33.865
You erased my pictures?

01:14:34.616 --> 01:14:37.285
I didn't erase them.
They were never there.

01:14:37.369 --> 01:14:39.037
- You're lying.
- Bart.

01:14:39.788 --> 01:14:41.456
Why are you doing this, man?

01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:43.542
- I'm not lying.
- What the fuck?

01:14:46.294 --> 01:14:47.379
Bart.

01:14:49.714 --> 01:14:50.674
Come here.

01:14:52.467 --> 01:14:53.552
Come on, man.

01:15:06.064 --> 01:15:09.150
It's okay.
I'm just happy you're here, man.

01:15:18.076 --> 01:15:19.411
Cannonball!

01:15:19.494 --> 01:15:22.289
Oh, you got me in the marbles,
Cannonball Guy.

01:15:22.372 --> 01:15:24.708
- And now you must pay.
- It tickles!

01:15:24.791 --> 01:15:27.419
- Daddy, he's tickling me.
- I gotcha!

01:15:27.502 --> 01:15:30.297
- That tickles!
- All right, Booger Monster.

01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:33.341
Let's give your uncle Bart some space
so he can get settled in.

01:15:33.425 --> 01:15:35.093
Bye, Booger Monster.

01:15:35.176 --> 01:15:36.052
All right.

01:16:06.666 --> 01:16:08.001
I think it looks cool.

01:16:09.794 --> 01:16:11.004
Could be worse.

01:16:12.797 --> 01:16:17.052
- Up close it looks kind of gross.
- Yeah. It's pretty fucking disgusting.

01:16:18.929 --> 01:16:21.348
- Thanks for getting my stuff.
- No problem.

01:16:21.932 --> 01:16:25.101
You might wanna go back and double-check
to make sure I got everything.

01:16:25.185 --> 01:16:28.730
'Cause I had Eve with me,
so who knows what I left behind?

01:16:28.813 --> 01:16:30.649
- Will do.
- Yeah.

01:16:33.777 --> 01:16:35.403
You gonna be okay in here?

01:16:35.487 --> 01:16:38.323
Oh, yeah. I'll be super cozy.

01:16:38.406 --> 01:16:41.785
Yeah, but are you gonna be, like, okay?

01:16:45.664 --> 01:16:48.333
Did I ever tell you about the time
I went down to CancÃºn?

01:16:48.416 --> 01:16:50.585
- Like, years ago with Whit?
- Yeah.

01:16:50.669 --> 01:16:53.380
On the plane, I was sitting
next to this older Black guy

01:16:53.463 --> 01:16:55.966
wearing a head-to-toe cowboy outfit.

01:16:56.049 --> 01:16:58.134
- I don't believe this.
- It's true.

01:16:58.885 --> 01:17:01.513
We get to talking,
and he tells me he's from Maryland.

01:17:01.596 --> 01:17:04.474
So I'm like, "What the hell is up
with the clothes? I gotta ask."

01:17:05.308 --> 01:17:07.394
And he says
that he used to be a big-rig driver

01:17:07.477 --> 01:17:09.437
and he would crisscross
the country every week.

01:17:10.146 --> 01:17:11.898
This one time he was outside of El Paso.

01:17:12.649 --> 01:17:15.151
He was getting out of his truck
and spilled coffee all over himself,

01:17:15.235 --> 01:17:16.194
just everywhere.

01:17:16.987 --> 01:17:19.072
So he goes to a truck stop
to get cleaned up,

01:17:19.155 --> 01:17:21.366
but he decides
he's just gonna buy a new shirt.

01:17:21.449 --> 01:17:24.452
But all they have are cowboy shirts.

01:17:25.537 --> 01:17:30.834
So once he gets the cowboy shirt,
he figures, "Fuck it. Why not go all in?"

01:17:30.917 --> 01:17:34.129
So he gets the boot and the hat
and the bolo tie, the whole deal.

01:17:34.796 --> 01:17:36.882
Goes into a diner to get something to eat.

01:17:36.965 --> 01:17:39.467
And as he walks in the door,
this little 3-year-old girl

01:17:39.551 --> 01:17:41.386
just lights up when she sees him.

01:17:41.469 --> 01:17:43.430
Runs up to him, gives him a big hug.

01:17:43.513 --> 01:17:46.141
Has her dad come over
and take a picture together.

01:17:46.224 --> 01:17:48.143
He said it was just great, made his day.

01:17:48.977 --> 01:17:50.145
But that's not it

01:17:50.228 --> 01:17:54.191
because, for the next two days,
everywhere he goes in this outfit,

01:17:54.274 --> 01:17:56.818
people just light up when they see him.

01:17:57.652 --> 01:18:02.782
And that's when he realizes
that everyone loves seeing a cowboy.

01:18:03.450 --> 01:18:05.202
And he loved that feeling so much,

01:18:05.285 --> 01:18:10.207
of bringing that, like, simple joy
into every room he walked into,

01:18:10.290 --> 01:18:12.584
that he decided from that moment on,

01:18:12.667 --> 01:18:15.212
he was always gonna dress like a cowboy.

01:18:17.088 --> 01:18:19.299
He seems like a pretty chill guy.

01:18:19.382 --> 01:18:20.383
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:18:23.803 --> 01:18:25.305
And I remember thinking:

01:18:27.182 --> 01:18:30.477
"God, I wanna have stories like that
when I'm older," you know?

01:18:32.229 --> 01:18:33.480
And now it's like...

01:18:35.941 --> 01:18:41.571
Well, I'm older and I have stories, but...

01:18:45.867 --> 01:18:48.578
I don't know,
I thought my stories would be different.

01:18:51.414 --> 01:18:52.457
I just...

01:18:53.250 --> 01:18:54.960
I thought they'd be happier.

01:18:55.043 --> 01:18:57.504
Come on, Barty. They will be, man.

01:18:58.213 --> 01:19:00.715
They will be. You just gotta give it time.

01:19:03.593 --> 01:19:06.471
It's just, when I thought she was crazy,
she was still real.

01:19:06.555 --> 01:19:10.767
You know,
I could still... hold her and smell her.

01:19:12.269 --> 01:19:13.353
But now it's...

01:19:15.605 --> 01:19:17.649
Look, you know I don't subscribe

01:19:17.732 --> 01:19:21.069
to the whole "everything happens
for a reason" bullshit.

01:19:21.945 --> 01:19:24.865
But for some reason, that girl,

01:19:25.615 --> 01:19:29.035
or hallucination or...

01:19:29.828 --> 01:19:31.872
I don't know,
whatever manifestation was caused

01:19:31.955 --> 01:19:35.417
by that lemon-sized mass
on your frontal lobe...

01:19:36.376 --> 01:19:40.881
made it so that you were at a hospital
exactly when you needed to be.

01:19:43.133 --> 01:19:47.804
And for the life of me,
I can't figure out a rational reason

01:19:47.888 --> 01:19:50.098
as to why the fuck that would happen.

01:19:53.059 --> 01:19:56.021
But it did. And you're here.

01:19:57.606 --> 01:19:59.441
I don't know, man. It's just...

01:20:00.775 --> 01:20:04.738
I just know that that girl came
into your life for a reason.

01:20:07.574 --> 01:20:08.825
That's enough for me.

01:20:16.917 --> 01:20:19.294
I'll get you some cowboy stuff
if you want it.

01:20:19.961 --> 01:20:22.005
That was actually the point
of my whole story.

01:20:27.886 --> 01:20:29.679
- Knock, knock.
- Hey, Larry.

01:20:29.763 --> 01:20:33.892
Hey. Dropping by to see how you're
settling in after your first week.

01:20:33.975 --> 01:20:36.269
Good. Good, I think. Yeah. Thanks.

01:20:36.353 --> 01:20:39.564
That's great. And just so you know,
everyone is so thrilled to have you here.

01:20:39.648 --> 01:20:43.693
And if you need any more time to recover
for your head stuff, that's totally cool.

01:20:43.777 --> 01:20:46.279
- I really appreciate that. Thank you.
- Nah, come on.

01:20:46.363 --> 01:20:48.073
Hey, it's a medical company.

01:20:48.156 --> 01:20:50.492
If anyone knows
that medical stuff happens,

01:20:50.575 --> 01:20:51.701
it's us, right?

01:20:53.328 --> 01:20:56.414
Yeah, I guess you would know that.

01:20:56.498 --> 01:20:58.250
- Keep up the good work, partner.
- Thanks.

01:21:00.585 --> 01:21:03.046
Larry, you dumb idiot.
You forgot the reason you came by.

01:21:03.129 --> 01:21:07.342
Your first check. Yeah.
All right. Now I'm really leaving.

01:21:07.425 --> 01:21:08.677
Thank you.

01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:09.803
Pound it.

01:21:10.929 --> 01:21:13.390
Yeah, there you go. That'll be our thing.

01:21:19.813 --> 01:21:21.857
Thank God you're still alive.

01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:25.318
Yeah. It's gonna take more
than some dumb tumor to get rid of me.

01:21:26.319 --> 01:21:28.029
Oh, let me look at you.

01:21:30.073 --> 01:21:33.577
If I was younger
and I would've seen you across a bar

01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:35.036
- with that...
- Oh, yeah?

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:37.289
I would've given you
the keys to the kingdom.

01:21:38.331 --> 01:21:40.917
Man. You know,
in another life, Patricia, you and me,

01:21:41.001 --> 01:21:44.045
we could've been
real destructive together.

01:21:44.129 --> 01:21:45.630
I would have ruined your life.

01:21:47.090 --> 01:21:48.466
I got you something.

01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:51.678
- Oh, no, really? That's sweet.
- Yes.

01:21:51.761 --> 01:21:55.640
For all the times you saved my sanity.
One parting shot.

01:21:55.724 --> 01:21:57.517
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

01:21:58.185 --> 01:21:59.561
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:22:06.359 --> 01:22:08.153
Oh, I didn't tell you who's moving in.

01:22:08.236 --> 01:22:10.989
- Tell me.
- Two EDM DJs.

01:22:11.072 --> 01:22:12.991
- EDM.
- No.

01:22:13.074 --> 01:22:16.203
- They're a couple.
- That is so many beats per minute.

01:22:16.286 --> 01:22:18.914
- It's gross.
- Love really does find a way.

01:22:18.997 --> 01:22:20.415
I guess it does.

01:22:22.626 --> 01:22:23.627
You don't have to rush.

01:22:23.710 --> 01:22:25.962
Those idiots aren't moving in
until tomorrow.

01:22:26.046 --> 01:22:27.214
Oh, here we go.

01:22:28.256 --> 01:22:29.299
Mr. Morelli.

01:22:29.841 --> 01:22:32.886
No, you cannot keep borrowing my plunger.

01:22:32.969 --> 01:22:35.680
Because you're an adult
and this is disgusting.

01:22:35.764 --> 01:22:37.807
Your IBS is not my problem.

01:24:55.111 --> 01:24:58.240
- This is you right here.
- Thank you. Thanks very much.

01:25:28.103 --> 01:25:30.814
<i>I love you, buddy. That's real.</i>

01:25:32.023 --> 01:25:33.817
<i>Always yours, Vienna.</i>

01:25:35.443 --> 01:25:38.989
<i>PS, look for the Pirates
to win big in the late '20s.</i>
