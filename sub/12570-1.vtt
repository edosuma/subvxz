00:05.250 --> 00:07.209
- For a ghoulish
- Halloween party

00:07.250 --> 00:08.585
From 8:00 p.m.

00:08.586 --> 00:09.918
until your doom!

00:09.959 --> 00:11.251
(CHUCKLES) Or until

00:11.252 --> 00:12.542
the taco bar runs out.

00:14.709 --> 00:16.042
- (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
- Oh.

00:16.082 --> 00:17.292
Ugh!

00:19.083 --> 00:20.792
Oh, Mrs. Chesterfield,

00:21.292 --> 00:23.042
- I bet you throw a
- great Halloween party.

00:23.083 --> 00:25.164
- People are afraid - of you every day
- Of the year.

00:28.083 --> 00:29.501
This party is for

00:29.502 --> 00:30.918
paying tenants only,

00:30.959 --> 00:32.418
and you, poor squatter,

00:32.418 --> 00:33.876
are not one.

00:35.083 --> 00:36.418
Maybe. But Jessie

00:36.419 --> 00:37.751
uses the day spa

00:37.792 --> 00:39.473
- more than anyone else
- in this building!

00:39.959 --> 00:41.189
And she's always doing

00:41.190 --> 00:42.417
laps in the pool.

00:42.459 --> 00:43.543
Come to think of it,

00:43.544 --> 00:44.626
when do you

00:42.459 --> 00:44.626
actually nanny?

00:51.626 --> 00:52.980
Pint-sized

00:52.981 --> 00:54.334
reprobates aren't

00:51.626 --> 00:54.334
invited either.

00:54.751 --> 00:55.793
Hey, we're not

00:55.794 --> 00:56.834
reprobates!

00:57.083 --> 00:58.250
Are we?

00:59.083 --> 01:00.230
You are.

01:00.231 --> 01:01.375
But I am offended!

01:02.709 --> 01:04.500
- Halloween
- is for kids.

01:04.542 --> 01:05.626
You seriously

01:05.627 --> 01:06.709
aren't inviting them

01:04.542 --> 01:06.709
to your party?

01:06.751 --> 01:08.042
Short answer, no.

01:08.083 --> 01:10.334
Long answer, no-no.

01:11.709 --> 01:13.042
- Well, my short
- answer is,

01:13.083 --> 01:14.334
- We don't want
- to go anyway.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.042
- And my long
- answer is...

Tobin Castevet.

did horrible things,

Shaun Smith.

04:52.731 --> 04:54.292
to attempt four

04:51.167 --> 04:54.292
consecutive 360's.

- supposed to be?

you are no Einstein?

05:05.083 --> 05:06.876
- What's that got to do
- with your costume?

05:08.083 --> 05:09.542
I am so glad we

05:09.543 --> 05:11.000
do not swim in the

05:08.083 --> 05:11.000

05:17.648 --> 05:19.042
as Chubby the Bear?

05:19.083 --> 05:20.083
That's so lame.

05:20.125 --> 05:21.647
It's not lame.

05:21.648 --> 05:23.167
Chubby's good people.

05:24.042 --> 05:25.459
He's my friend,

05:25.460 --> 05:26.876
he's always there for me,

05:27.083 --> 05:28.188
and he single-handedly

05:28.189 --> 05:29.292
negotiated peace

05:29.334 --> 05:31.209
- between the U.S.
- and Canada.

05:32.083 --> 05:34.042
- The U.S. and Canada
- were never at war.

05:34.083 --> 05:35.626
I believe the words

05:35.627 --> 05:37.167
you're looking for are,

05:37.209 --> 05:39.000
"Thank you, Chubby."

05:40.792 --> 05:41.938
Or as they say

05:41.939 --> 05:43.083
in French Canada,

05:43.125 --> 05:44.918
"Merci, Chubbee."

Wow, Emma, cool

- to your kiddie party.

06:01.606 --> 06:03.000
why I'm wearing

06:00.209 --> 06:03.000
a ton of lipstick,

06:03.083 --> 06:04.250
and stuffed my bra.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.022
Well, I hope you

06:08.023 --> 06:09.042
used the tissues

06:07.000 --> 06:09.042

(STUTTERS)

06:48.502 --> 06:49.918
A ghost attacked me!

06:50.209 --> 06:51.772
It was a scary blob

06:51.773 --> 06:53.334
with a hideous smile.

06:54.125 --> 06:56.406
- Are you sure it wasn't just
- you looking in the mirror?

07:00.083 --> 07:01.418
Mrs. Chesterfield

07:01.419 --> 07:02.751
said the architect

07:00.083 --> 07:02.751
of the building

07:02.792 --> 07:04.042
could summon spirits.

07:04.083 --> 07:06.000
- Maybe Bertram
- did see a ghost!

07:06.209 --> 07:07.918
- There's no maybe
- about it!

07:07.959 --> 07:09.834
- How else do you
- explain this goop?

07:10.083 --> 07:11.251
We're ten feet away

07:11.252 --> 07:12.417
from Kipling's cage

07:10.083 --> 07:12.417
and Luke's bathroom.

07:12.459 --> 07:14.379

07:30.459 --> 07:31.813

07:31.814 --> 07:33.167
than Mrs. Chesterfield's.

07:33.209 --> 07:34.459
Aw, thank you, Zuri.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.167
- But it's about
- having fun,

Not who throws

07:37.210 --> 07:38.210
the better party.

07:38.876 --> 07:39.960
Then why did you put up

07:39.961 --> 07:41.042
this banner that says,

Psst! Jessie.

07:51.834 --> 07:53.167
You must come look at this.

07:53.209 --> 07:54.751
I discovered

07:54.752 --> 07:56.292
something very creepy

07:53.209 --> 07:56.292
about our building!

07:56.334 --> 07:58.059
- Ravi, the creepiest thing
- about this building

07:58.083 --> 07:59.083
Is a boy whose best

friend is a lizard.

After Bertram's

08:04.731 --> 08:06.042
ghost sighting,

08:03.417 --> 08:06.042
I did some research

08:06.083 --> 08:07.251
and found an

08:07.252 --> 08:08.417
article that says

08:06.083 --> 08:08.417
Tobin Castevet

08:08.459 --> 08:09.876
constructed this

08:09.877 --> 08:11.292
building to be a portal

08:08.459 --> 08:11.292
to the spirit world!

08:12.083 --> 08:14.324
- It's hard to take - you seriously with
- That mustache.

08:14.876 --> 08:16.480
(CHUCKLES) You look

08:16.481 --> 08:18.083
like Super Mario's

08:14.876 --> 08:18.083

08:19.250 --> 08:21.250
Jessie, this is serious.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.751
Ravi, relax.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.000
There's no way that...

08:24.209 --> 08:25.417
"In one 100 years,

08:25.459 --> 08:27.083
- "a door between

08:33.501 --> 08:35.000
is exactly one 100 years!

08:35.042 --> 08:36.542
And I analyzed the sample

08:36.543 --> 08:38.042
of the goo found on Bertram.

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

17:46.083 --> 17:47.459
Mrs. Chesterfield?

17:47.751 --> 17:49.709
- (IN DEEP VOICE)
- I am Zorag the Destroyer!

17:50.042 --> 17:52.000
- The time has come
- to meet your doom!

17:55.083 --> 17:56.083
(LAUGHS)

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
(GRUNTING)

18:08.500 --> 18:09.689
Tony! Tony!

18:09.690 --> 18:10.876
Unlock the door!

18:11.083 --> 18:12.459
(LAUGHING)

18:14.083 --> 18:15.313
I'm not afraid

18:15.314 --> 18:16.542
of you anymore.

18:16.584 --> 18:17.584
(SHRIEKS)

18:18.083 --> 18:19.792
- (LAUGHS)
- (WHIMPERS)

18:23.751 --> 18:25.417
Foolish mortals!

18:25.667 --> 18:28.417
I am Zorag the Destroyer!

18:28.459 --> 18:31.000
You dare stand in my way?

18:32.792 --> 18:34.500
- Ah!
- (ZURI SCREAMS)

18:35.083 --> 18:37.042
Oh, you bet we dare!

18:37.083 --> 18:38.459
Ravi, stand in her way.

18:39.876 --> 18:41.042
Me? Why not you?

18:41.083 --> 18:42.334
After all, demons

18:42.335 --> 18:43.584
are a girl's best friend.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.918
- Enough with the
- jibber-jabber!

18:46.959 --> 18:48.000
Let's light her up!

18:50.083 --> 18:51.334
(LAUGHS)

18:56.083 --> 18:57.542
Can't catch me.

18:57.543 --> 18:59.000
Point, Zorag!

18:59.959 --> 19:01.876
Prepare to die!

19:02.500 --> 19:04.459
- Jessie! Fire up
- the helicopter!

19:04.500 --> 19:06.042
- If the world's
- coming to an end,

19:06.083 --> 19:07.584
- I want to be
- in Barbados!

19:08.125 --> 19:09.375
Ooh!

19:10.083 --> 19:11.083
Whoa!

19:12.417 --> 19:14.834
Get off me, mortal!

19:15.959 --> 19:17.417
Ooh, Rhoda.

19:18.083 --> 19:19.667
Loving this new look.

19:20.083 --> 19:21.272
And that Kathleen

19:21.273 --> 19:22.459
Turner voice.

19:22.500 --> 19:23.918
(PURRS)

19:23.959 --> 19:25.584
- (SCREAMS)
- Get her!

19:26.083 --> 19:27.230
What about Bertram?

19:27.231 --> 19:28.375
Collateral damage!

19:28.709 --> 19:30.000
No!

19:33.083 --> 19:35.042
No!

19:37.667 --> 19:39.000
It's cold!

19:40.125 --> 19:41.500
(LAUGHS)

19:41.959 --> 19:43.000
(SCREAMS)

19:57.083 --> 19:59.000
Guys, we did it!

19:59.209 --> 20:00.667
And best of all,

20:00.709 --> 20:01.751
I got to cover

20:01.752 --> 20:02.792
people with goo!

20:02.834 --> 20:04.000
Not me.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.459
Way to go, Einstein.

20:15.125 --> 20:17.042
- So when Zorag was
- trapped under Bertram,

20:17.083 --> 20:18.542
We blasted them

20:18.543 --> 20:20.000
both with Ravi's

20:17.083 --> 20:20.000
Ghost-Be-Gone goo.

20:20.167 --> 20:21.605
Then all the ghosts

20:21.606 --> 20:23.042
were sucked back to

20:20.167 --> 20:23.042
where they came from.

20:23.083 --> 20:24.480
So, long story short,

20:24.481 --> 20:25.876
we saved the world!

20:25.918 --> 20:27.125
No big whoop.

20:28.209 --> 20:30.125
- Well, Bessie...
- Jessie.

20:30.792 --> 20:31.918
After hearing

20:31.919 --> 20:33.042
how you, Zubi...

20:30.792 --> 20:33.042
Zuri.

20:33.083 --> 20:34.876
- And Rover...
- Ravi.

20:36.083 --> 20:37.500
Were so brave,

20:37.542 --> 20:38.813
to face off against

20:38.814 --> 20:40.083
all those scary,

20:37.542 --> 20:40.083
evil spirits,

20:40.125 --> 20:42.042
I think we can all agree,

20:42.083 --> 20:43.105
the cooler party

20:43.106 --> 20:44.125
is on the roof!

20:44.167 --> 20:46.042
- Everyone, follow me!
- (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

20:46.876 --> 20:48.000
JESSIE: What?

20:50.626 --> 20:52.042
Traitors!

20:52.083 --> 20:53.810
- Oh, well, If you can't
- beat 'em, join 'em.

20:53.834 --> 20:55.377
Oh. Mmm. Ooh.

20:55.378 --> 20:56.918
Yes. Awkward.

20:57.083 --> 20:58.563
(CLEARS THROAT)

20:58.564 --> 21:00.042
I'd really like to

20:57.083 --> 21:00.042
invite you, Barbara...

21:00.083 --> 21:02.000
- Barbara? That's
- not even close.

21:03.167 --> 21:04.460
But, you're still not

21:04.461 --> 21:05.751
on the guest list.

21:06.292 --> 21:07.501
I could be.

21:07.502 --> 21:08.709
You don't even

21:06.292 --> 21:08.709
know my name!

21:09.083 --> 21:10.605
Wow, she was

21:10.606 --> 21:12.125
less evil when

21:09.083 --> 21:12.125
she was Zorag.

21:13.042 --> 21:14.042
So, what was I like

21:14.043 --> 21:15.043
when I was possessed?

21:15.083 --> 21:16.167
Really creepy.

21:16.209 --> 21:17.709
- Your breath
- smelled like death.

21:17.751 --> 21:19.271
- And you almost
- destroyed the world.

21:19.709 --> 21:21.500
- So, pretty much
- the way you are now.

21:22.667 --> 21:24.143
- All right. Let's
- just forget all that

21:24.167 --> 21:25.751
- And have fun in
- our haunted house.

21:25.792 --> 21:27.125
- We have Bobbing
- for Skulls,

21:27.167 --> 21:28.751
- Pin the Tail
- on the Werewolf,

21:28.792 --> 21:29.935
- That angry green
- fire-head...

21:29.959 --> 21:30.959
- (RUMBLING)
- (GASPS)

21:32.083 --> 21:33.751
This isn't over!

21:34.083 --> 21:35.500
(ALL SCREAMING)

21:39.083 --> 21:40.250
(SCREAMS)

21:41.876 --> 21:43.460
Whoa. Guys, I just had

21:43.461 --> 21:45.042
the craziest dream.

21:45.292 --> 21:46.646
Chesterfield and

21:46.647 --> 21:48.000
I had competing

21:45.292 --> 21:48.000
Halloween parties,

21:48.250 --> 21:49.272
Emma and Luke

21:49.273 --> 21:50.292
summoned a demon,

21:50.334 --> 21:51.667
and there was a goblin

21:51.668 --> 21:53.000
in the freezer.

21:54.125 --> 21:56.167
- At least it wasn't
- Bertram's leftover lasagna.

21:56.209 --> 21:57.688
Either way, your colon

21:57.689 --> 21:59.167
would be haunted.

22:00.792 --> 22:01.897
Actually, Halloween

22:01.898 --> 22:03.000
was great fun.

22:03.167 --> 22:04.876
- Until you raided
- our candy stash,

22:04.918 --> 22:06.758
- And stuffed your face
- until you passed out.

22:09.083 --> 22:12.042
Oh, sorry.

22:12.083 --> 22:13.355
Sorry, guys. I guess

22:13.356 --> 22:14.626
that explains the

22:12.083 --> 22:14.626
nightmares.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.626
You ate our candy.

22:16.918 --> 22:17.918
Your nightmare's

22:17.919 --> 22:18.919
just beginning.

22:23.083 --> 22:24.584
(GROANS)

22:25.209 --> 22:26.667
Ow!

22:27.667 --> 22:29.167
I fell on my Scooter Bar.
