Rick: Babe?

00:39.167 --> 00:41.433
I got you a little surprise.

00:41.467 --> 00:44.100
I think you're gonna like it.

00:44.567 --> 00:46.800
I saw Luke playing ball
down the street,

00:46.833 --> 00:51.133
so I know that we are
all alone right now.

00:51.167 --> 00:53.400
Just the two of us, baby.

00:53.433 --> 00:57.000
Ooh, man, that turkey
smells fantastic.

Go ahead and pull it!

01:09.367 --> 01:11.100
Rick: Baby, go
out back right now.

01:11.133 --> 01:13.467
Sam: Honey,
you just stay right there.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.400
Sit down!

01:19.833 --> 01:21.567
Rick: She got nothing
to do with this, Jenkins.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.733
Sam: She's got
everything to do with this.

01:23.767 --> 01:30.500
My wife, my kids, my life,
you took 'em all from me!

01:30.533 --> 01:32.067
Rick: What do you want?

01:32.100 --> 01:34.467
Sam: What do I want?

01:34.500 --> 01:36.233
How about a cure for cancer?

01:36.267 --> 01:38.733
[coughing]

01:41.400 --> 01:43.467
I'm dying, detective.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.133
I'm gonna die cold
and alone

01:45.167 --> 01:48.333
and I want you to know
what that feels like.

01:49.533 --> 01:51.233
What are you, a ninja?

01:51.267 --> 01:54.100
Keep moving towards me,
detective, I'm begging you.

01:54.133 --> 01:56.400
Rick: Turn around
right now and leave.

01:56.433 --> 01:57.767
No harm, no foul.

No harm, no foul?

02:01.267 --> 02:03.800

Oh, I'm good.

05:17.267 --> 05:19.533
I called your cell phone.

places to go, I bet.

in a hurry all the time,

Thanksgiving Day.

You're right.

God gave me.

of wisdom.

more than we can handle, right?

just spit it out?

borrow your phone?

neither of us.

a cell phone,

you're not gonna get
a cab to come out here

in the middle of nowhere
and pick you up on Thanksgiving.

no chance you're

15:44.200 --> 15:48.367
gonna be driving into town
anytime soon?

walk back out to the highway,

someone'll come along
and pick you up,

15:53.233 --> 15:54.800

doing when he sent you my way.

Rick, you're pathetic.

18:56.467 --> 18:57.667
Grace: What was that?

18:57.700 --> 18:59.767
Rick: Nothing, ma'am.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.567
Rick: So, does this say--

19:09.133 --> 19:11.233
This is clear on
the other side of town.

19:11.267 --> 19:12.500
Grace: I know.

19:12.533 --> 19:14.100
I don't know what
I was thinking,

19:14.133 --> 19:16.733
trying to go all
the way on foot.

19:16.767 --> 19:19.167
I would've never made it.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.567
You're a life saver.

19:26.233 --> 19:29.200
It's funny how different
things look sometimes.

19:29.233 --> 19:32.433
You ever notice that?

19:32.467 --> 19:35.767
Gosh, the streets are so empty.

19:36.533 --> 19:40.467
Guess everyone's enjoying it
with their families today.

19:40.500 --> 19:44.800
I can almost smell all
the turkeys in the oven.

19:44.833 --> 19:55.067
[music]

19:55.067 --> 20:00.033
[music]

20:00.133 --> 20:14.267
[music]

20:14.367 --> 20:16.400
Grace: That was
so rude of me.

20:16.433 --> 20:18.233
Rick: What's that?

20:18.267 --> 20:20.133
Grace: Falling asleep
like that.

20:20.167 --> 20:23.333
I've just been
so worn down lately.

20:23.367 --> 20:25.667
Rick: No worries.

20:25.700 --> 20:27.533
Grace: I can't wait
to be with my family.

20:27.567 --> 20:30.267
I'm sure you're gonna
be with your family too.

20:31.167 --> 20:33.633
But I'm really thankful
and grateful that I'm riding

20:33.667 --> 20:36.400
in this car with you
and that I'm not dragging

20:36.433 --> 20:38.100
that old suitcase around.

20:38.133 --> 20:40.367
I would've never made it.

20:41.833 --> 20:44.333
Are you a man of faith?

20:45.067 --> 20:47.233
Rick: What's that, ma'am?

20:47.267 --> 20:51.100
Grace: You know, faith, God?

20:52.267 --> 20:54.467
Rick: I don't really
think about it much, ma'am.

20:54.500 --> 20:57.500
Grace: Oh, that's too bad.

20:58.167 --> 20:59.733
I don't know how anyone
can get through it all

20:59.767 --> 21:01.533
without a little faith.

21:01.567 --> 21:04.567
I have this feeling like you
have to hang onto that hope

21:04.600 --> 21:07.800
that there's something
bigger than we are,

21:07.833 --> 21:10.233
that there's a purpose
to it all.

21:10.667 --> 21:13.233
We're gonna have
to work on that, Mister.

21:13.267 --> 21:14.700
Rick: Sorry, ma'am?

21:14.733 --> 21:18.133
Grace: Your faith, or lack
of faith I suppose.

21:18.167 --> 21:21.133
And please call me Grace.

21:21.167 --> 21:23.567
Rick: Whatever you say,
Grace.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.367
Grace: Is there a turkey
waiting for you at home?

21:25.400 --> 21:27.300
Rick: I'm finding it hard
to focus on the road, Grace,

21:27.333 --> 21:28.733
with all the questions.

21:28.767 --> 21:31.267
Grace: Right.
I'm so sorry.

21:31.300 --> 21:33.100
You wouldn't believe this,
but I'm like the last person

21:33.133 --> 21:35.167
you would ever accuse
of being a motor mouth,

21:35.200 --> 21:38.100
let alone being nosey.

21:38.133 --> 21:40.300
Just for some reason,
I just can't shut up.

21:41.333 --> 21:43.333
Sorry.

21:43.733 --> 21:46.467
Rick: Let's just
get you home.

21:46.500 --> 21:50.700
Grace: Actually, if you make
a right up here.

21:50.733 --> 21:53.267
Rick: Right here?

21:56.200 --> 21:57.600
Grace: Yes, stop.
Stop, stop, stop.

21:57.633 --> 22:00.267
Rick: Stop?
Grace?

22:06.500 --> 22:09.033
Where's she going?

22:09.067 --> 22:10.700
Hey!

22:10.733 --> 22:13.133
Grace?

22:14.067 --> 22:16.033
What the?

22:16.067 --> 22:18.133
Grace?

22:19.833 --> 22:22.167
Grace!
Hey!

22:22.200 --> 22:23.600
Wait up, will you?

22:23.633 --> 22:25.633
Grace!

22:26.600 --> 22:28.567
What are you?
Grace!

22:28.600 --> 22:30.100
No, no, no.

22:30.133 --> 22:31.333
Hey, don't go--

22:31.367 --> 22:33.400
Don't go in there.

22:33.433 --> 22:35.800
Hey!

22:35.833 --> 22:37.600
Grace!

22:37.633 --> 22:40.167
What are you--

22:42.233 --> 22:44.433
Grace?

22:45.333 --> 22:47.733
Grace?
Come here.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.267
What are you doing here?

22:51.767 --> 22:53.600
Hey.

22:53.633 --> 22:54.767
Grace: Come on!

22:54.800 --> 22:56.200
Come on!

22:56.233 --> 22:58.267
Rick: Grace, please.

22:59.600 --> 23:02.600
Grace!
Grace!

23:02.633 --> 23:04.300
Hey!

23:04.333 --> 23:05.700
We shouldn't be in here.

23:05.733 --> 23:06.667
Grace: Oh, come on.

23:06.700 --> 23:08.300
You never snuck into
a high school before?

23:08.333 --> 23:10.567
Rick: No, I was too busy
sneaking out of school.

23:10.600 --> 23:14.600
Grace: I have
so many memories.

23:14.633 --> 23:16.433
I used to lay up there
in those bleachers,

23:16.467 --> 23:21.433
sun shining,
radio blasting.

23:21.467 --> 23:23.133
Rick: You went
to school here?

23:23.167 --> 23:24.367
Grace: You?

23:24.400 --> 23:25.800
Rick: Regional.

23:25.833 --> 23:27.600
We used to stomp
you guys in football.

23:27.633 --> 23:29.133
Grace: Oh yeah?

23:29.167 --> 23:30.767
We used to stomp you
right back in this pool.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.333
Rick: Yeah, that's
not really the same thing.

23:32.367 --> 23:33.767
Grace: Really?

23:33.800 --> 23:34.633
Rick: No.

23:34.667 --> 23:36.433
Grace: Oh, you
ready to back that up?

23:36.467 --> 23:38.433
Rick: No, I'm not a big
fan of the pool.

23:38.467 --> 23:39.633
Grace: Oh, someone's
being a chicken.

23:39.667 --> 23:40.533
Bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk!

23:40.567 --> 23:42.300
Rick: No, someone wants
to get out of here

23:42.333 --> 23:44.600
before we get caught.

23:49.433 --> 23:52.633
Grace: I remember the final
meet like it was yesterday.

23:52.667 --> 23:57.567
Senior year, this place
was packed.

23:57.600 --> 24:00.100
We'd run most of our races.

24:00.133 --> 24:01.700
Well, my team had.

24:01.733 --> 24:05.467
I wasn't really that good,
but I didn't care.

24:05.500 --> 24:08.333
I was happy to cheer my team on.

24:08.367 --> 24:10.300
Rick: Grace?

24:10.333 --> 24:14.367
Grace: For some reason,
I don't know why,

24:14.400 --> 24:19.467
I looked up and there he was.

24:20.133 --> 24:25.200
He was sitting right here
next to my mom.

24:25.233 --> 24:29.667
My dad had actually
made it to a meet.

24:29.700 --> 24:31.300
You don't understand.

24:31.333 --> 24:35.500
In 4 years, my dad had
never made it to a meet.

24:35.533 --> 24:40.600
He was always traveling,
always too busy.

24:40.633 --> 24:45.133
And he was there, clapping
and cheering me on

24:45.167 --> 24:48.533
like it was the Olympics
or something.

24:48.567 --> 24:50.233
At first, I didn't
know what to do.

24:50.267 --> 24:51.600
I was a little embarrassed.

24:51.633 --> 24:53.367
I'm sitting on the bench,
passing out towels,

24:53.400 --> 24:55.267
and he didn't care.

24:55.300 --> 24:58.667
He was so proud of me.

25:00.167 --> 25:03.133
You wouldn't believe
what happened next.

25:03.733 --> 25:05.367
Rick: What?

25:05.400 --> 25:06.767
Grace: The whole team's
calling my name.

25:06.800 --> 25:08.333
"Grace! Grace! Grace!"

25:08.367 --> 25:11.467
And I'm, like, staring
at my dad, oblivious.

25:11.500 --> 25:14.067
Finally, one of the girls
grabs me and she pulls me.

25:14.100 --> 25:16.333
And she points at the coach,
and the coach is frantic,

25:16.367 --> 25:18.033
calling me over.

25:18.067 --> 25:20.767
And I'm like, "What
did I do wrong now?"

25:20.800 --> 25:23.267
It was the final relay
of the day.

25:23.300 --> 25:27.300
One of the girls got hurt
or something.

25:27.333 --> 25:31.033
And for some reason,
the coach was calling my name.

25:31.067 --> 25:33.433
Rick: What'd you do?

25:33.467 --> 25:35.433
Grace: I swam.

25:35.467 --> 25:40.567
I swam like I had
never swam before.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.367
And we won!

25:45.400 --> 25:47.300
We actually won.

25:47.333 --> 25:50.000
It was awesome.

25:51.200 --> 25:52.800
And that race
qualified us to regionals,

25:52.833 --> 25:57.267
and the rest,
like they say, is history.

25:58.100 --> 26:01.267
Well, at least around
these parts, it's a big deal.

26:01.300 --> 26:03.600
Rick: Yeah.

26:04.600 --> 26:10.133
Grace: There was my daddy,
just cheering me on.

26:21.167 --> 26:27.433
What I didn't know
was that....

26:27.467 --> 26:31.500
he had already packed
all his things in his car.

26:38.567 --> 26:41.733
That was the last day
I saw him.

26:44.667 --> 26:46.767
Rick: That's rough.

26:46.800 --> 26:49.400
Grace: Yeah.

26:50.067 --> 26:51.633
You just don't know how much
you need your father

26:51.667 --> 26:54.467
until he's gone.

26:57.833 --> 26:59.467
I'm sorry.

26:59.500 --> 27:02.267
I don't even know why
I'm sharing this with you.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.200
Rick: Come on.

27:10.267 --> 27:11.667
Let's get you home.

27:11.700 --> 27:14.367
Grace: Yeah.

27:28.267 --> 27:29.367
Rick: Here.

27:29.400 --> 27:30.700
Grace: Thank you.

27:30.733 --> 27:31.800
Rick: Oh, here, let me.

27:31.833 --> 27:33.133
Grace: I got it.

27:33.167 --> 27:34.200
Rick: No, no, it's okay.

27:34.233 --> 27:35.400
Grace: I got it.

27:35.433 --> 27:36.400
Rick: No, it's fine.

27:36.433 --> 27:37.267
I just--

27:37.300 --> 27:38.767
Grace: I promise
it's in good hands.

27:38.800 --> 27:41.667
Rick: Okay, all right?

27:41.700 --> 27:43.300
Grace: Whoa, this is heavy.

27:43.333 --> 27:45.533
What do you have
in here, a toaster?

27:46.467 --> 27:48.633
Rick: No, no, no!

27:51.333 --> 27:52.600
Grace: Maybe I should go.

27:52.633 --> 27:54.200
Rick: I'm sorry.

27:54.233 --> 27:55.367
I didn't mean to do that.

27:55.400 --> 27:56.667
Grace: Look, I didn't mean
to upset you.

27:56.700 --> 27:58.767
Rick: No, it's just this--

27:58.800 --> 28:02.067
I just have some personal things
in here, that's all.

28:03.633 --> 28:06.333
Let me just take you home.

28:10.267 --> 28:12.400
Here.

28:13.667 --> 28:15.767
Will you keep that safe for me?

28:16.733 --> 28:18.733
Grace: Sure.

28:22.300 --> 28:32.333
[music]

28:32.333 --> 28:37.300
[music]

28:37.400 --> 28:47.433
[music]

28:47.433 --> 28:52.300
[music]

28:52.400 --> 29:02.433
[music]

29:02.433 --> 29:07.300
[music]

29:08.200 --> 29:09.567
Rick: Another surprise ahead?

29:09.600 --> 29:10.800
Grace: You never know.

29:10.833 --> 29:14.300
Rick: Just skip the breaking
and entering next time, okay?

29:14.333 --> 29:15.567
Grace: What breaking?

29:15.600 --> 29:17.700
I just jiggled the door
and it opened.

29:18.633 --> 29:21.500
Aye-aye, officer.

29:23.233 --> 29:24.600
Ah!

29:24.633 --> 29:26.600
So you can smile.

29:26.633 --> 29:28.533
I knew it!

29:28.567 --> 29:31.267
Rick: I smile.

29:31.833 --> 29:33.333
Grace: Wow.

29:33.367 --> 29:35.100
That was two in a row.

29:35.133 --> 29:37.500
You should smile more often.

29:37.533 --> 29:40.067
It looks good on you.

29:40.600 --> 29:43.200
You know, people would barely
notice how bad you dress

29:43.233 --> 29:45.100
if you smiled a little more.

29:45.133 --> 29:46.767
Rick: Hey!

29:46.800 --> 29:48.567
Grace: You know what
they say about a smile, right?

29:48.600 --> 29:49.767
Rick: What's that?

29:49.800 --> 29:51.333
Grace: A smile is like
tight underwear.

29:51.367 --> 29:53.233
It makes your cheeks go up.

29:53.267 --> 29:55.767
[laughing]

29:56.400 --> 29:58.633
Rick: That was really bad.

29:58.667 --> 30:00.333
[Grace laughing]

30:00.367 --> 30:02.367
Rick: That was so bad.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.233
[Grace screaming]
A dios mio!

30:08.267 --> 30:10.367
Watch out!

30:10.800 --> 30:12.667
Rick: Are you okay?

30:12.700 --> 30:14.767
Grace: You almost
killed a man.

30:15.433 --> 30:17.433
Rick: I know that guy.

30:18.067 --> 30:20.167
Hey!

30:20.200 --> 30:22.167
Are you okay, bud?

30:23.500 --> 30:25.133
Are you okay?

30:25.167 --> 30:27.667
Jeremiah: I've got a band
of angels watching over me.

30:27.700 --> 30:28.767
I'm all good.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.700
Rick: What are you doing
in the middle of the road?

30:30.733 --> 30:32.300
I mean, I could--

30:32.333 --> 30:33.767
Two seconds later.

30:33.800 --> 30:35.800
Jeremiah: We're all where
we're supposed to be

30:35.833 --> 30:38.633
at any given time.

30:38.667 --> 30:40.767
Rick: I can't say
the same for your cart.

30:42.567 --> 30:46.367
[Jeremiah laughing]

30:48.633 --> 30:50.500
Don't that feel good?

30:50.533 --> 30:53.200
Rick: What's that?

30:53.233 --> 30:54.567
Jeremiah: What's
the last time you had

30:54.600 --> 30:56.767
a good laugh like that, Rick?

30:56.800 --> 30:58.767
Rick: I couldn't even
tell you.

30:58.800 --> 31:00.700
How'd you know my name?

31:00.733 --> 31:02.567
Jeremiah: Oh, I know
who you are.

31:02.600 --> 31:05.333
Your wife, Jenna,
was a shining light

31:05.367 --> 31:08.133
to all of us at the shelter.

31:08.167 --> 31:10.433
Rick: Oh yeah.

31:10.467 --> 31:12.600
Yeah, she used to love
working down there.

31:12.633 --> 31:15.400
Jeremiah: We all miss her.

31:16.700 --> 31:18.600
Rick: Yeah.

31:18.633 --> 31:21.000
Jeremiah: I'm Jeremiah.

31:21.533 --> 31:22.767
Rick: Pleasure.

31:22.800 --> 31:25.433
Rick.

31:25.467 --> 31:27.767
Of course, you knew that.

31:28.433 --> 31:31.233
Grace: Everyone okay?

31:32.633 --> 31:35.367
Jeremiah: And who
is the pretty lady?

31:35.400 --> 31:39.300
Grace: Hi, I'm Grace.

31:39.333 --> 31:41.033
Jeremiah: Grace?

31:41.067 --> 31:42.267
A perfect name.

31:42.300 --> 31:43.700
Jeremiah.

31:43.733 --> 31:47.200
Grace: Jeremiah,
lifted up by God.

31:47.233 --> 31:48.600
Jeremiah: That's right.

31:48.633 --> 31:50.433
Smart lady.

31:50.467 --> 31:52.667
You know, I think the Lord
knew just what he was doing

31:52.700 --> 31:55.200
when he put this cart
in your path.

31:55.233 --> 31:58.100
I have something for you.

31:59.100 --> 32:01.333
I was gonna give it
to you this morning,

32:01.367 --> 32:06.133
but you were in such
a hurry that I didn't.

32:06.167 --> 32:11.200
And then, I--well, this belongs
to your son, Luke.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.167
Rick: Where'd you get this?

32:16.200 --> 32:18.600
Jeremiah: Jenna used to bring
Luke by the shelter

32:18.633 --> 32:22.700
from time to time, and I would
play catch with him out back.

32:22.733 --> 32:27.100
Well, one day he left it there,
and when we didn't hear--

32:27.133 --> 32:30.700
Anyway, I thought I would
keep it secure.

32:33.433 --> 32:35.633
Rick: Thank you.

32:35.667 --> 32:39.333
Jeremiah: Now you can give
it to him yourself,

32:39.367 --> 32:44.533
although I suppose you bought
him a new one a long time ago.

32:44.567 --> 32:59.267
[music]

32:59.300 --> 33:01.767
Grace: You okay?

33:01.800 --> 33:06.567
Rick: I never liked her
working down at that shelter,

33:06.600 --> 33:09.200
all the riffraff.

33:10.133 --> 33:13.167
Maybe I was wrong.

33:13.800 --> 33:17.133
She always saw
the good in people.

33:17.167 --> 33:19.567
I just saw the bad.

33:20.267 --> 33:22.800
Grace: What happened to her?

33:22.833 --> 33:25.400
There I go being nosey again.

33:26.067 --> 33:29.133
Rick: I was a cop.

33:29.167 --> 33:31.433
Protect and serve.

33:31.467 --> 33:34.067
It was my job to protect her.

33:35.167 --> 33:37.167
Grace: Rick, pull over.

33:51.433 --> 33:54.500
Rick: We were working
this big case for a long time.

33:56.667 --> 33:58.667
We finally busted the guy.

34:00.233 --> 34:08.500
A real stand-up citizen,
Rotary Club, philanthropist,

34:08.533 --> 34:11.600
kids in Ivy League schools,
the works.

34:11.633 --> 34:13.300
Turns out he was also
responsible for half

34:13.333 --> 34:16.300
the drug trafficking
in the state.

34:16.333 --> 34:22.400
I got a promotion,
and he got 14 years.

34:23.833 --> 34:29.433
Instead of rotting
in a cell somewhere,

34:29.467 --> 34:32.333
he got cancer.

34:33.367 --> 34:37.033
He got it real bad too.

34:37.067 --> 34:40.233
So, they moved
him to a hospital.

34:40.267 --> 34:48.067
I knew it wasn't gonna take him
long to find a way out of there.

34:48.100 --> 34:52.200
Turns out I was the first person
he couldn't wait to see.

34:56.300 --> 34:58.667
I had scrimped and saved,

34:58.700 --> 35:01.533
doing everything to hide
it from Jenna.

35:01.567 --> 35:03.667
So, while I'm sitting
at a travel agency,

35:03.700 --> 35:07.267
booking the Paris trip
she always dreamed of,

35:07.300 --> 35:09.667
that dirtbag was coming for me.

35:10.333 --> 35:12.433
Rick: Babe?

35:13.200 --> 35:15.500
I got you a little surprise.

35:15.533 --> 35:18.300
I think you're gonna like it.

35:18.333 --> 35:21.033
I saw Luke playing ball
down the street,

35:21.067 --> 35:24.633
so I know that we are
all alone right now.

35:25.300 --> 35:27.467
Just the two of us, baby.

35:27.500 --> 35:31.300
Ooh, man, that turkey
smells fantastic.

35:32.567 --> 35:35.433
[Jenna gasping]

35:35.467 --> 35:37.200
Rick: Hey.

35:37.233 --> 35:39.167
Sam: Well, isn't that sweet?

35:39.200 --> 35:40.733
Go ahead and pull it!

35:40.767 --> 35:43.367
[coughing]

35:43.400 --> 35:45.133
Rick: Baby, go
out back right now.

35:45.167 --> 35:47.667
Sam: Honey,
you just stay right there.

35:49.833 --> 35:52.267
Sit down!

35:53.767 --> 35:55.533
Rick: She got nothing
to do with this, Jenkins.

35:55.567 --> 35:57.700
Sam: She's got everything
to do with this.

35:57.733 --> 36:04.100
My wife, my kids, my life,
you took 'em all from me!

36:04.533 --> 36:06.067
Rick: What do you want?

36:06.100 --> 36:08.533
Sam: What do I want?

36:08.567 --> 36:10.433
How about a cure for cancer?

36:10.467 --> 36:13.400
[coughing]

36:15.433 --> 36:17.467
I'm dying, detective.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.100
I'm gonna die
cold and alone,

36:19.133 --> 36:22.200
and I want you to know
what that feels like.

36:23.533 --> 36:25.167
What are you, a ninja?

36:25.200 --> 36:28.267
Keep moving towards me,
detective, I'm begging you.

36:28.300 --> 36:30.300
Rick: Turn around
right now and leave.

36:30.333 --> 36:31.767
No harm, no foul.

36:31.800 --> 36:33.467
Sam: Oh, really?

36:33.500 --> 36:35.400
No harm, no foul?

36:35.433 --> 36:37.733
[coughing]

36:37.767 --> 36:39.767
How about this for harm and--

36:39.800 --> 36:43.067
[timer dings]

36:43.100 --> 36:45.467
[gunshot firing]

36:46.133 --> 36:47.733
Rick: Three shots rang out.

36:47.767 --> 36:50.667
[gunshots firing]

36:55.167 --> 36:58.700
Rick: One went through
my knee,

36:58.733 --> 37:01.433
another one finished him off.

37:05.767 --> 37:13.033
I fell to the ground
and then I saw my wife,

37:13.067 --> 37:15.800
laying there on the ground.

37:15.833 --> 37:18.267
She was coughing.

37:18.300 --> 37:21.133
[Jenna coughing]

37:21.167 --> 37:23.133
Rick: Come here.
Come here.

37:23.167 --> 37:25.133
What's going on?
What's going on?

37:25.167 --> 37:26.567
What's going on?

37:26.600 --> 37:27.533
Jenna: I can't breathe.

37:27.567 --> 37:29.100
Rick: It's okay, baby.
It's gonna be fine.

37:29.133 --> 37:30.567
It's gonna be fine.
Just take it easy.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.233
Take it easy.

37:32.267 --> 37:33.700
Jenna: Promise me.

37:33.733 --> 37:35.267
Rick: Whatever you want.

37:35.300 --> 37:36.733
Whatever you want.

37:36.767 --> 37:40.533
Jenna: Make sure Luke knows
how much you love him.

37:42.433 --> 37:44.433
Rick: I promise you.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.267
Jenna: I love you.

37:50.300 --> 37:51.767
I love you.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.400
Rick: I love you.

37:53.433 --> 37:54.467
I love you.
Come on.

37:54.500 --> 37:57.067
Hey, stay with me, okay?

37:57.100 --> 38:00.067
Baby?
Baby?

38:00.100 --> 38:02.767
Baby?

38:02.800 --> 38:06.000
Rick: I failed.

38:06.800 --> 38:12.533
As a cop,
as a husband...

38:14.467 --> 38:17.333
...as a father.

38:20.067 --> 38:23.033
That was 5 years ago today.

38:25.200 --> 38:28.600
Grace: I'm so sorry.

38:29.333 --> 38:36.333
Rick: I've lived that day
over and over and over.

38:39.833 --> 38:43.267
Grace: It's never too late
to keep your promise.

38:47.367 --> 38:51.100
Rick: Let's get you home.

38:51.133 --> 39:01.167

Grace: Rick, can you
stop the car?

39:34.067 --> 39:36.233
Rick: What is it?

39:49.100 --> 39:52.367
Grace, what's going on?

39:55.067 --> 39:56.500
Time's a-ticking.

39:56.533 --> 39:58.367
Grace: Do you think it's true
that God has chosen

39:58.400 --> 40:02.233
that one special person
for each of us?

40:02.267 --> 40:03.733
That one person
that's meant to be with us

40:03.767 --> 40:05.600
for the rest of our lives.

40:05.633 --> 40:07.300
Rick: Here we go again
with the God stuff.

40:07.333 --> 40:09.500
Can we just--

40:09.533 --> 40:12.033
Grace?

40:16.367 --> 40:17.733
What are you doing, Grace?

40:17.767 --> 40:19.633
What--not--

40:19.667 --> 40:21.133
Grace: Come on, Rick.

40:21.167 --> 40:22.600
I can see a glimmer
of hope in you.

40:22.633 --> 40:25.200
You don't have to be
the tough one all the time.

40:27.833 --> 40:30.033
Rick: Grace?

40:32.567 --> 40:35.267
She did it again.

40:45.533 --> 40:48.333
Grace: Do you believe
in love at first sight?

40:48.700 --> 40:50.300
I used to work at this
little coffee shop

40:50.333 --> 40:52.533
not too far from here,

40:52.567 --> 40:56.200
and this tall,
handsome Marine walks in.

40:56.233 --> 40:58.700
He sits at the counter.

40:58.733 --> 41:01.633
I'm so nervous I could
barely pour his coffee.

41:01.667 --> 41:04.367
Rick: What are we doing here,
Grace?

41:04.400 --> 41:06.733
Grace: It was love
at first sight for him.

41:06.767 --> 41:08.800
He proposed on our first date.

41:08.833 --> 41:10.467
I mean, he didn't have
a ring or anything,

41:10.500 --> 41:17.067
but he knew I was the one,
and I knew he was the one too.

41:17.100 --> 41:18.667
Rick: And then you came here
and learned to dance

41:18.700 --> 41:20.400
and wowed everyone
at your wedding, right?

41:20.433 --> 41:23.533
Grace: Wow, that was so mean.

41:24.100 --> 41:26.533
Did you really have to say that?

41:29.433 --> 41:30.700
Rick: You think
you're the only one

41:30.733 --> 41:33.433
with special moments, Grace?

41:33.467 --> 41:36.600
My wife and I came
to this same studio.

41:36.633 --> 41:39.367
This is where she taught me
how to dance.

41:39.400 --> 41:42.400
And yes, we wowed everybody
at our wedding,

41:42.433 --> 41:46.467
and we vowed that we
would never stop dancing.

41:46.500 --> 41:49.767
And then your God,
in his infinite wisdom,

41:49.800 --> 41:53.667
took her from me,

41:53.700 --> 41:56.733
and we're never gonna
dance together again.

41:58.600 --> 42:01.267
How's that for a happy ending?

42:02.567 --> 42:04.333
Grace: I'm so sorry.

42:04.367 --> 42:06.733
Rick: Sorry for what?

42:06.767 --> 42:08.767
You don't have to be sorry.

42:08.800 --> 42:11.733
You get to go have Thanksgiving
with your family, and I can't.

42:11.767 --> 42:14.267
Now, can we just go
to the car, please?

42:15.400 --> 42:18.133
Grace: Was it love
at first sight for you too?

42:18.167 --> 42:19.433
Rick: Does it matter?

42:19.467 --> 42:22.000
Grace: Maybe.
Was it?

42:23.633 --> 42:25.100
Rick, was it?

42:25.133 --> 42:27.600
Rick: Yes!

42:29.300 --> 42:30.733
My heart was beating
out of my chest

42:30.767 --> 42:33.200
the first moment I saw her.

42:33.233 --> 42:34.633
Grace: Then maybe
it is true that God has

42:34.667 --> 42:38.067
that one special person
for us.

42:38.100 --> 42:41.333
And it doesn't matter
how long we spend with them.

42:41.367 --> 42:45.567
What matters is how we spend
the time we had with them.

42:46.167 --> 42:51.100
Maybe that's why God
put us together today,

42:51.133 --> 42:56.167
to teach us how to appreciate
every single moment we have.

43:06.400 --> 43:09.100
Rick: What are you--

43:09.667 --> 43:11.700
No, I'm not much
of a dancer anymore.

43:11.733 --> 43:14.700
I've got that bum leg, remember?

43:14.733 --> 43:17.633
Grace: Come on.
No one's watching.

43:20.667 --> 43:22.200
Rick: Yeah.

43:22.233 --> 43:23.633
Jenna: Dance with me,
officer.

43:23.667 --> 43:24.500
Rick: Not now.
Not now.

43:24.533 --> 43:26.200
I gotta review this case
for the morning.

43:26.233 --> 43:27.500
Jenna: Shh.

43:27.533 --> 43:29.433
The case'll still be there.
This moment won't.

43:29.467 --> 43:32.033
Rick: It's a big case.
What are you doing?

43:32.067 --> 43:33.500
What are you doing?
I gotta work.

43:33.533 --> 43:35.233
I gotta work.

43:35.267 --> 43:36.633
I can't dance right now.

43:36.667 --> 43:39.400
Jenna: Yes, you can.

the way home **

46:45.367 --> 46:48.267
Rick: Your God's not making
this any easier on us.

46:51.733 --> 46:53.433
It's dead.

46:53.467 --> 46:55.600
This old piece of junk is dead.

46:55.633 --> 46:57.500
Grace: We could always
go walking.

46:57.533 --> 46:58.700
Rick: Walking?

46:58.733 --> 46:59.700
No.
You know what?

46:59.733 --> 47:00.667
I'm just gonna go ask--

47:00.700 --> 47:02.400
Grace: No, let's go walking.
It'll be fun.

47:02.433 --> 47:04.167
It's a great day.
I'm gonna grab my stuff.

47:04.200 --> 47:05.167
Rick: You wanna walk?

47:05.200 --> 47:07.200
Grace: Yeah!

47:12.500 --> 47:14.067
Rick: I mean--

47:14.100 --> 47:16.233
Grace: Thank you.
Let's go.

47:17.333 --> 47:21.267
Rick: Okay.
Let's walk.

47:21.300 --> 47:31.333
[music]

47:31.333 --> 47:36.300
[music]

47:36.400 --> 47:42.467
[music]

47:42.567 --> 47:44.433
Rick: Okay, so I think
if we take a left here

47:44.467 --> 47:45.367
and we go around the bend,

47:45.400 --> 47:47.333
we'll get straight through
to your house.

47:47.367 --> 47:50.333
Grace: Isn't there another way
we can go?

47:50.367 --> 47:51.800
Rick: Well, this'll be
the quickest way.

47:51.833 --> 47:53.333
Grace: I think it's
a dead end anyway,

47:53.367 --> 47:55.600
so we can just go
somewhere else.

47:55.633 --> 47:58.100
Rick: Grace, what's up?

47:58.133 --> 48:00.400
Grace: My in-laws live
up there.

48:00.433 --> 48:01.667
Rick: Oh!

48:01.700 --> 48:04.233
Well, maybe they can
help us out with my car.

48:04.267 --> 48:06.400
Grace: No, they moved
a long time ago.

48:06.433 --> 48:08.600
Can we just take another street?

48:08.633 --> 48:10.567
Please.

48:10.600 --> 48:12.267
Rick: I understand.

48:12.300 --> 48:14.333
You know, I mean, so you have
some problems with your in-laws.

48:14.367 --> 48:16.167
Join the club.

48:16.200 --> 48:17.800
Grace: I didn't say that.

48:17.833 --> 48:20.333
They were wonderful.

48:20.367 --> 48:30.400
[music]

48:30.400 --> 48:35.367

48:35.467 --> 48:45.500

[music]

48:50.567 --> 48:53.600
David: Can you show me
how the lights work?

48:54.333 --> 48:56.333
[truck beeping]

48:56.367 --> 48:58.167
David: Awesome.

48:58.200 --> 49:00.667
Hey, you wanna play
hide and seek?

49:01.300 --> 49:03.267
Okay, go hide.

49:05.767 --> 49:08.267
Grace: Don't go too far.

49:08.300 --> 49:09.767
David: He's fine.

49:09.800 --> 49:12.167
Grace: Tommy was
everything to them.

49:12.200 --> 49:14.033
He was their one
connection to their son

49:14.067 --> 49:16.733
while he was serving
in Afghanistan.

49:16.767 --> 49:20.133
Rick: So, your husband
served overseas?

49:20.167 --> 49:23.533
Grace: I would Skype with him
whenever we could.

49:23.567 --> 49:30.533
Tommy was so proud of his daddy,
and Daddy loved him to pieces.

49:32.333 --> 49:35.067
David: Here I come!

49:38.267 --> 49:40.167
Grace: So, how was your trip?

49:40.200 --> 49:41.467
We so wanted to go.

49:41.500 --> 49:42.800
Bella: Oh, it was wonderful.

49:42.833 --> 49:44.467
You two have got
to join us next time.

49:44.500 --> 49:46.233
Grace: I know.

49:46.267 --> 49:48.100
David: I can't find Tommy.

49:48.133 --> 49:49.500
Grace: What?

49:49.533 --> 49:51.500
Tommy?

49:51.533 --> 49:53.600
Bella: Well, he can't
have gone far.

49:54.467 --> 49:56.633
Grace: Tommy?

50:01.233 --> 50:03.700
Tommy?
Tommy!

50:11.367 --> 50:13.100
Grace: I couldn't breathe.

50:13.133 --> 50:14.767
Grace: Tommy!

50:14.800 --> 50:17.533
Grace: I couldn't move.

50:20.733 --> 50:22.767
You're not the only one that
thinks they failed to take care

50:22.800 --> 50:25.633
of the ones they loved.

50:26.167 --> 50:29.133
I've struggled with that
for so many years,

50:29.167 --> 50:32.567
blaming myself every day.

50:32.600 --> 50:35.400
Rick: Grace, that
wasn't your fault.

50:37.133 --> 50:40.567
Grace: Faith is believing
in the things we can't see.

50:40.600 --> 50:43.567
I'm just trusting it's all
part of a better plan

50:43.600 --> 50:46.500
and that there's
a deeper meaning.

50:46.533 --> 50:48.200
Rick: I gave up trying
to figure that out

50:48.233 --> 50:49.433
a long time ago.

50:49.467 --> 50:50.733
Grace: You can't give up.

50:50.767 --> 50:52.633
Rick, you can't.

50:52.667 --> 50:56.533
You have to trust that God
knows better than we do.

50:56.567 --> 50:58.600
Rick: I've been dead
inside for years, Grace.

50:58.633 --> 51:00.467
There's no hope for me.

51:00.500 --> 51:05.467
Grace: I was in the same
exact dark hole that you're in.

51:05.500 --> 51:07.467
There is hope.

51:07.500 --> 51:09.767
Believe me.

51:12.667 --> 51:14.367
Rick: Come on.

51:14.400 --> 51:16.333
We should get going.
It's gonna get cold out soon.

51:16.367 --> 51:17.600
Grace: Yeah.

51:17.633 --> 51:19.167
Thank you, Rick.

51:19.200 --> 51:20.267
Rick: For what?

51:20.300 --> 51:24.433
Grace: For driving me,
for walking with me, listening.

51:26.433 --> 51:28.367
Rick: It's Thanksgiving,
right?

51:28.400 --> 51:30.300
Grace: That's right.

51:30.333 --> 51:33.000
Rick: Come on.

51:39.733 --> 51:41.133
Anne: Luke?

51:41.167 --> 51:42.700
Honey, it's time to eat.

51:42.733 --> 51:45.267
Luke: Be right there.

51:54.333 --> 51:56.167
Anne: I hope you're hungry!

51:56.200 --> 51:58.033
Luke: Been smelling turkey
all day, Grandma.

51:58.067 --> 51:59.367
I'm starving.

51:59.400 --> 52:00.467
Anne: Well, good.

52:00.500 --> 52:02.133
'Cause we've got
some eating to do.

52:02.167 --> 52:03.733
Hey, hey, hey!

52:03.767 --> 52:06.233
Aren't you forgetting
something, young man?

52:09.233 --> 52:12.667
Dear Lord, we thank you
for this special day

52:12.700 --> 52:14.533
and for all
of our blessings.

52:14.567 --> 52:17.567
And Lord, we just ask you
to watch over those

52:17.600 --> 52:22.033
who can't be here with us today
to share in them.

52:22.067 --> 52:24.700
In your name, amen.

52:28.267 --> 52:30.333
Luke?

52:30.367 --> 52:32.667
Luke: Amen.

52:33.267 --> 52:36.467
Anne: So, have you heard
from your father today?

52:36.500 --> 52:39.600
I left a message for him
on his machine.

52:39.633 --> 52:41.200
Luke: Yeah, Grandma.

52:41.233 --> 52:42.800
He should be here any sec.

52:42.833 --> 52:44.333
Anne: Well, you never know.

52:44.367 --> 52:45.767
It could happen.

52:45.800 --> 52:48.333
Luke: Grandma, every holiday
you set an extra seat,

52:48.367 --> 52:51.700
and every year it
stays that way.

52:51.733 --> 52:56.200
Anne: Well, I guess I just
can't give up on him.

52:56.233 --> 53:00.800
Luke: Can we please just eat
and not talk about it?

53:00.833 --> 53:03.400
Anne: Of course.

53:11.700 --> 53:15.267
Luke: Grandma, do you mind
if I eat in my room?

53:17.467 --> 53:22.633
Anne: You know, it's just
taking him time, Luke.

53:22.667 --> 53:25.767
And it's taking more time
than we would like,

53:25.800 --> 53:27.533
but he'll come around.

53:27.567 --> 53:29.500
You'll see.

53:29.533 --> 53:32.800
Luke: Does it even matter
anymore, really?

53:32.833 --> 53:36.033
Anne: Baby, of course
it matters.

53:36.067 --> 53:39.033
Your father loves you.

53:39.067 --> 53:41.200
Luke: Yeah?

53:41.233 --> 53:44.133
Well, he's got a funny way
of showing it.

53:44.167 --> 53:46.067
Can I?

53:46.100 --> 53:48.533
Anne: Okay.

53:49.667 --> 53:51.600
You have enough there?

53:51.633 --> 53:54.067
Luke: Yeah.
Thanks, Grandma.

53:54.100 --> 53:56.567
Anne: Okay.

53:57.500 --> 53:59.267
All right, well be sure
to save room

53:59.300 --> 54:01.033
for that cherry pie I made you.

54:01.067 --> 54:02.367
Luke: I will.

54:02.400 --> 54:05.100
Anne: I made whipped cream!

54:07.667 --> 54:10.200
[sighing]

54:11.700 --> 54:13.800
Grace: Mmm, I think
I just got a whiff of turkey

54:13.833 --> 54:15.633
coming out of the oven.

54:15.667 --> 54:17.300
Do you like turkey?

54:17.333 --> 54:19.100
Rick: Yeah, I guess so.

54:19.133 --> 54:21.333
I mean, I actually--

54:21.367 --> 54:25.467
I haven't sat down for
a turkey dinner in a long time.

54:26.233 --> 54:27.567
Grace: Come
to think of it,

54:27.600 --> 54:29.433
I can't remember the last time
I had turkey either.

54:29.467 --> 54:30.567
Rick: Yeah?

54:30.600 --> 54:32.167
Well, I'm sure
your family'll have

54:32.200 --> 54:35.167
a nice turkey dinner
waiting for you.

54:38.767 --> 54:40.100
Grace: You okay?

54:40.133 --> 54:41.633
Rick: Yeah, I'm good.
You?

54:41.667 --> 54:43.267
Grace: Yeah.

54:43.300 --> 54:44.800
I'm sorry I've ruined your day

54:44.833 --> 54:48.067
with this crazy little
journey of mine.

54:48.100 --> 54:51.600
Rick: Trust me, I had
nothing better to do.

54:55.500 --> 54:57.500
You know what?

54:57.533 --> 55:01.133
Why don't we go warm up
inside there for a minute?

55:12.633 --> 55:15.200
Grace: Cute little church,
isn't it?

55:15.233 --> 55:17.200
Rick: Yeah, if you say so.

55:17.233 --> 55:18.733
Grace: What are you doing?

55:18.767 --> 55:20.333
Rick: I'm just gonna see
if it's open.

55:20.367 --> 55:21.500
Grace: It's Thanksgiving.
It's gonna be closed.

55:21.533 --> 55:23.333
Rick: I'm gonna jiggle it
and see.

55:23.367 --> 55:25.367
It's been working for you.

55:29.333 --> 55:32.233
[Grace laughing]

55:46.133 --> 55:49.033
Grace: It's so nice.

55:52.200 --> 56:02.200
[music]

56:02.300 --> 56:07.433
[music]

56:07.533 --> 56:10.333
Rick: Not really much
warmer than outside, is it?

56:10.367 --> 56:13.400
Grace: Oh, I'm fine.

56:13.433 --> 56:16.267
I just haven't sat in one
of these pews in a while.

56:16.300 --> 56:18.600
I miss it.

56:18.633 --> 56:20.400
Rick: You?

56:20.433 --> 56:23.767
Now, see, I would
take you for a regular

56:23.800 --> 56:27.467
for this kind of thing.

56:27.500 --> 56:29.700
Grace: I am, in my heart.

56:29.733 --> 56:33.567
I just haven't been able to come
to service in a long time.

56:35.367 --> 56:37.333
Rick: The whole no car thing?

56:37.367 --> 56:39.433
[Grace laughing]
No, silly.

56:39.467 --> 56:43.700
But you're right, a car would've
been very helpful today.

56:46.300 --> 56:50.067
So, did your wife go to church?

56:52.233 --> 56:53.700
I'm sorry, you don't have
to talk about it.

56:53.733 --> 56:55.333
Rick: No, no, it's fine.

56:55.367 --> 56:57.167
Yes.

56:57.200 --> 57:01.567
Yep, she always came to church
and I would come with her,

57:01.600 --> 57:03.733
you know, 'cause she
wanted me to.

57:03.767 --> 57:07.233
And my son seemed to like it,
so you know,

57:07.267 --> 57:10.600
that made her happy.

57:10.633 --> 57:13.367
Grace: You're
a kind man, Rick.

57:13.400 --> 57:16.433
Any other guy would just sit on
the couch and watch a game

57:16.467 --> 57:18.367
or whatever they do.

57:18.400 --> 57:20.467
Rick: No, it made her happy.
That's the only reason.

57:20.500 --> 57:24.600
I haven't stepped foot
inside a church in 5 years.

57:25.333 --> 57:28.300
Grace: I understand.

57:30.300 --> 57:36.467
Sometimes it's hard
trusting that his ways

57:36.500 --> 57:39.633
are higher than ours.

57:42.500 --> 57:44.433
Rick: You know, we should
probably get a move on,

57:44.467 --> 57:47.800
only 'cause it's only gonna get
colder as the night goes on.

57:47.833 --> 57:51.000
Grace: Do you mind
if I pray before we go?

57:54.400 --> 57:57.000
Rick: Sure.

57:58.467 --> 58:00.800
Grace: You can join me
if you'd like.

58:00.833 --> 58:06.233
Rick: No, no.
I'm good right here.

58:15.433 --> 58:21.333
Grace: Lord, I was in
a dark place this morning.

58:21.367 --> 58:26.300
Forgive me
for not trusting you.

58:26.333 --> 58:28.367
You sent me
to the middle of nowhere,

58:28.400 --> 58:33.567
and I met
this kind man, Rick.

58:33.600 --> 58:38.233
And you made us meet at
that very moment for a reason.

58:38.267 --> 58:42.133
And I pray that you
soften his heart.

58:42.167 --> 58:44.567
He's had a rough go of it.

58:44.600 --> 58:48.133
And I pray that you give him
understanding and peace

58:48.167 --> 58:54.167
so we can continue our time
together today, amen.

59:00.133 --> 59:10.133
[music]

59:10.233 --> 59:17.300
[music]

59:17.400 --> 59:20.300
I hope you didn't mind me
adding you to the prayer.

59:20.767 --> 59:22.267
Rick: No.

59:22.300 --> 59:24.200
No, it's fine.

59:24.233 --> 59:26.400
It's fine.
Come on.

59:29.767 --> 59:31.633
[Grace gasping]
Wait!

59:31.667 --> 59:33.167
Rick: What?

59:33.200 --> 59:34.433
Grace: I left
my purse inside.

59:34.467 --> 59:37.000
Rick: I'll get it for you.

59:51.233 --> 1:00:01.267

1:00:16.333 --> 1:00:26.200

1:00:26.300 --> 1:00:32.600
Rick: God, if you're up there...

1:00:39.700 --> 1:00:41.700
...please help me.

1:00:56.600 --> 1:00:58.300
Grace: Thank you.

1:00:58.333 --> 1:01:00.267
Rick: You're welcome.

1:01:02.400 --> 1:01:04.233
Grace: We can
cut through here.

1:01:04.267 --> 1:01:06.300
Rick: Okay.

1:01:12.700 --> 1:01:13.800
Rick: Hey!

1:01:13.833 --> 1:01:15.100
Where are we going?

1:01:15.133 --> 1:01:16.167
Grace: Shortcut!

1:01:16.200 --> 1:01:17.200
Rick: Shortcut?

1:01:17.233 --> 1:01:18.633
Are you sure?

1:01:18.667 --> 1:01:21.600
I mean--like I have a choice.

1:01:24.767 --> 1:01:26.367
Grace!

1:01:27.100 --> 1:01:28.233
Grace!

1:01:28.267 --> 1:01:29.433
Where are we going now?

1:01:29.467 --> 1:01:30.767
Grace: I'm just trying
to save some time,

1:01:30.800 --> 1:01:32.100
get you home to your son.

1:01:32.133 --> 1:01:33.267
Rick: I was thinking
about that.

1:01:33.300 --> 1:01:35.133
You know, Grace,
my son is--

1:01:35.167 --> 1:01:36.367
It's just not the best--

1:01:36.400 --> 1:01:37.667
Grace: I'm listening.

1:01:37.700 --> 1:01:39.133
Rick: I know you say
you're listening,

1:01:39.167 --> 1:01:40.467
but you're not.

1:01:40.500 --> 1:01:41.700
You're not really listening.
You're just walking.

1:01:41.733 --> 1:01:43.067
You just keep walking.

1:01:43.100 --> 1:01:44.333
Grace!

1:01:44.367 --> 1:01:45.767
Hey!
Grace!

1:01:45.800 --> 1:01:47.633
Can you slow down
a tad please?

1:01:47.667 --> 1:01:49.133
Grace: Sorry.

1:01:49.167 --> 1:01:50.400
I don't know what's
gotten into me.

1:01:50.433 --> 1:01:53.133
I think it's still open space.

1:01:53.167 --> 1:01:56.467
Rick: Hey, that's
my old ball field.

1:01:56.500 --> 1:01:58.067
I played little league there.

1:01:58.100 --> 1:01:59.333
Grace: It was?

1:01:59.367 --> 1:02:00.500
Rick: Yes.

1:02:00.533 --> 1:02:01.733
Wow, it's changed a lot.

1:02:01.767 --> 1:02:03.800
But, oh man, back in the day,
we had dugouts

1:02:03.833 --> 1:02:05.467
on either side
of the backstop

1:02:05.500 --> 1:02:07.533
and the bleachers
were over in the corner.

1:02:07.567 --> 1:02:10.333
My mom and pop,
they never missed a game.

1:02:10.367 --> 1:02:12.467
Grace: Really?

1:02:13.267 --> 1:02:16.267
Rick: It's been a long time
since I've seen it.

1:02:34.200 --> 1:02:38.533
I would bring my son here before
he was even old enough to play.

1:02:40.633 --> 1:02:43.200
He couldn't wait.

1:02:44.367 --> 1:02:45.600
Grace: I'm sure you were
in those bleachers

1:02:45.633 --> 1:02:50.133
watching every minute of your
boy playing ball, weren't you?

1:02:51.400 --> 1:02:53.733
Rick: No, I wasn't, Grace.

1:02:53.767 --> 1:02:56.033
I was always too busy.

1:02:56.067 --> 1:02:58.733
Grace: Oh.
I'm sorry.

1:03:00.067 --> 1:03:02.567
Rick: He would always beg me
to play ball with him.

1:03:04.500 --> 1:03:08.267
He would wear that little glove
and he would say,

1:03:08.300 --> 1:03:11.667
"Daddy, you play
catch with me?"

1:03:11.700 --> 1:03:14.567
"Not today, buddy.

1:03:14.600 --> 1:03:17.700
Daddy's gotta go catch
some bad guys."

1:03:18.633 --> 1:03:21.600
Grace: At least he's still
got you around.

1:03:21.633 --> 1:03:27.200
Rick: When his mother--
when Jenna was killed,

1:03:27.233 --> 1:03:30.533
it was just a bad time.

1:03:30.567 --> 1:03:32.567
I was--

1:03:37.167 --> 1:03:39.500
He's been with my mom
ever since.

1:03:39.533 --> 1:03:41.167
Grace: But it's been 5 years.

1:03:41.200 --> 1:03:42.367
You still see him, though.

1:03:42.400 --> 1:03:43.467
Rick: Of course I see him.

1:03:43.500 --> 1:03:45.333
I see him every day.

1:03:45.367 --> 1:03:47.033
He doesn't know I'm there.

1:03:47.067 --> 1:03:49.467
Grace: He doesn't know
you're there?

1:03:49.500 --> 1:03:53.267
Rick: When I drive by,
I see him playing ball

1:03:53.300 --> 1:03:56.567
and hanging with his friends.

1:03:57.433 --> 1:04:01.067
Grace: Rick,
you can't do that.

1:04:01.100 --> 1:04:03.267
A son needs his father.

1:04:03.300 --> 1:04:05.500
It's not fair for you
to stay away.

1:04:05.533 --> 1:04:06.767
Rick: He's doing great.

1:04:06.800 --> 1:04:08.667
He's a good kid.

1:04:08.700 --> 1:04:10.333
He's better off without me.

1:04:10.367 --> 1:04:12.367
Grace: You don't believe that.

1:04:12.400 --> 1:04:15.400
I'm sure he misses you
as much as you miss him.

1:04:16.167 --> 1:04:18.300
Rick: I wouldn't know
what to say.

1:04:18.333 --> 1:04:19.600
Grace: Just tell him
the truth.

1:04:19.633 --> 1:04:22.000
Tell him you love him.

1:04:23.467 --> 1:04:26.300
Rick: It's too late
for that, Grace.

1:04:27.100 --> 1:04:30.033
Grace: Rick,
if you're still breathing,

1:04:30.067 --> 1:04:33.300
it's never too late to tell
your son that you love him.

1:04:33.833 --> 1:04:36.333
I can't do that anymore.

1:04:36.367 --> 1:04:39.233
You don't understand how much
I long to hold my boy,

1:04:39.267 --> 1:04:40.600
to tell him that I love him,

1:04:40.633 --> 1:04:43.533
to tell him that I'm gonna
be there for him.

1:04:43.567 --> 1:04:47.233
You still have time.
Please.

1:04:49.767 --> 1:04:53.367
Rick: You're a special woman,
Grace.

1:04:53.400 --> 1:04:55.700
Grace: You're a special man,
Rick.

1:04:55.733 --> 1:04:59.667
And you're a father
that needs his son.

1:04:59.700 --> 1:05:02.633
Now, go out there
and make it right.

1:05:06.433 --> 1:05:08.600
Come on.

1:05:12.800 --> 1:05:16.433
Grace: So, is Rick short for
something like Richard, Ricky?

1:05:16.467 --> 1:05:18.600
Rick: Yeah.
Yeah, it's short for Ricky.

1:05:18.633 --> 1:05:20.500
My parents were born in Cuba.

1:05:20.533 --> 1:05:22.667
They loved watching
"I Love Lucy."

1:05:22.700 --> 1:05:24.233
[Grace laughing]
Really?

1:05:24.267 --> 1:05:28.100
Rick: No, not really,
gullible.

1:05:28.133 --> 1:05:33.367
No, it's short for Richard
in a long line of Richards.

1:05:33.400 --> 1:05:35.700
What about you, huh?

1:05:35.733 --> 1:05:37.500
Is your name short for Gracie?

1:05:37.533 --> 1:05:39.167
Grace: Oh, now you're
just making fun of me.

1:05:39.200 --> 1:05:40.400
Rick: I'm sorry.

1:05:40.433 --> 1:05:41.733
[laughing]

1:05:41.767 --> 1:05:43.167
Grace: No,
when my parents met,

1:05:43.200 --> 1:05:45.467
they were missionaries.

1:05:45.500 --> 1:05:47.633
They wanted to remind me
every day how to live my life

1:05:47.667 --> 1:05:50.667
and never forgetting
God's grace.

1:05:51.400 --> 1:05:52.800
Rick: That fits you.

1:05:52.833 --> 1:05:54.133
Grace: Thank you.

1:05:54.167 --> 1:05:55.100
I'm gonna take that
as a compliment.

1:05:55.133 --> 1:05:57.467
Rick: You should take that
as a compliment.

1:05:57.500 --> 1:05:59.333
So, is that who
we're gonna go see?

1:05:59.367 --> 1:06:00.733
Grace: Who?

1:06:00.767 --> 1:06:03.267
Rick: Well, you know,
today, this whole journey.

1:06:03.300 --> 1:06:05.500
I mean, we're gonna
go see your parents?

1:06:05.533 --> 1:06:07.100
Grace: Oh, no.

1:06:07.133 --> 1:06:08.667
My mom, she died
a couple of years ago.

1:06:08.700 --> 1:06:12.633
And well, my dad,
you know that story.

1:06:13.267 --> 1:06:16.100
Rick: Sorry.

1:06:16.133 --> 1:06:18.333
I really don't know
how you do it, Grace.

1:06:18.367 --> 1:06:19.700
Grace: What's that?

1:06:19.733 --> 1:06:21.500
Rick: The way you just--
you keep the faith,

1:06:21.533 --> 1:06:27.567
I mean, despite all these sad
things that've happened to you.

1:06:27.600 --> 1:06:30.400
I mean, next thing,
you're gonna tell me

1:06:30.433 --> 1:06:34.400
you're dying of some rare
tropical disease or something.

1:06:34.433 --> 1:06:37.633
[Grace laughing]
Yeah, that would be something.

1:06:46.233 --> 1:06:48.567
Rick: What's the rush, Grace?

1:06:48.600 --> 1:06:50.133
How did we get here?

1:06:50.167 --> 1:06:51.733
Grace: Come on,
we're almost there.

1:06:51.767 --> 1:06:53.300
Rick: No.

1:06:53.333 --> 1:06:55.467
No, I don't wanna
go this way, Grace.

1:06:55.500 --> 1:06:57.367
Grace!

1:06:58.300 --> 1:07:00.667
Grace?

1:07:09.700 --> 1:07:12.100
Grace: We're here.

1:07:12.433 --> 1:07:13.800
It's Thanksgiving, Rick.

1:07:13.833 --> 1:07:17.133
What better time than now?

1:07:17.167 --> 1:07:19.033
Rick: I don't think
I can do it, Grace.

1:07:19.067 --> 1:07:20.567
Grace: Your son needs you.
You need your son.

1:07:20.600 --> 1:07:22.633
Of course you can do it.

1:07:22.667 --> 1:07:24.700
Rick: What if he hates me?

1:07:24.733 --> 1:07:27.067
Grace: That's not possible.

1:07:40.833 --> 1:07:43.233
Rick: Okay.

1:07:46.367 --> 1:07:48.633
Rick: Ma?

1:07:48.667 --> 1:07:51.400
Anne: I knew it!

1:07:51.433 --> 1:07:53.633
I just knew it!

1:07:56.367 --> 1:07:58.167
Rick: Happy Thanksgiving,
Mom.

1:07:58.200 --> 1:08:00.333
Anne: Yes it is.

1:08:00.367 --> 1:08:02.133
Oh my goodness,
where are my manners?

1:08:02.167 --> 1:08:03.300
I'm Anne.

1:08:03.333 --> 1:08:04.767
Grace: Grace.

1:08:04.800 --> 1:08:06.200
Anne: Well,
that's a lovely name.

1:08:06.233 --> 1:08:07.367
Grace: Thank you.

1:08:07.400 --> 1:08:09.033
Anne: You should've told me
you were bringing a guest.

1:08:09.067 --> 1:08:10.633
I'm a mess.

1:08:10.667 --> 1:08:12.200
My goodness, you're cold as ice.

1:08:12.233 --> 1:08:13.200
Come in.
Come in.

1:08:13.233 --> 1:08:14.467
Are y'all hungry?

1:08:14.500 --> 1:08:15.633
Grace: I'm starving.

1:08:15.667 --> 1:08:16.500
Anne: I've got so much food.

1:08:16.533 --> 1:08:18.167
Please, come on,
I'll warm something up.

1:08:18.200 --> 1:08:19.167
Rick: Mom.
Mom.

1:08:19.200 --> 1:08:20.533
Anne: What?

1:08:20.567 --> 1:08:21.733
Rick: Is Luke here?

1:08:21.767 --> 1:08:24.167
Anne: Well, he's next door,
honey, playing with his friends.

1:08:24.200 --> 1:08:26.700
But you know, he'll be back
within the hour.

1:08:26.733 --> 1:08:29.100
So, please, come and eat.

1:08:29.133 --> 1:08:31.433
Oh my goodness!

1:08:42.300 --> 1:08:43.700
Anne: So, tell me,
how long have you two

1:08:43.733 --> 1:08:46.167
been seeing each other?

1:08:46.200 --> 1:08:47.500
Rick: Oh, what was it?

1:08:47.533 --> 1:08:50.500
It was, like, noon?

1:08:50.533 --> 1:08:52.367
Grace: I think
it was more like 1.

1:08:52.400 --> 1:08:54.100
Rick: Was it 1?
It was closer to 1.

1:08:54.133 --> 1:08:56.133
Anne: Well, you're crazy.

1:08:58.200 --> 1:09:08.233

1:09:24.333 --> 1:09:25.467

1:09:25.500 --> 1:09:26.667
Ladies first.

1:09:26.700 --> 1:09:28.100
Grace: Thank you!

1:09:28.133 --> 1:09:28.967
Rick: Absolutely.
Mom, amazing.

1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:30.567
I don't know if I can
eat this but--

1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:32.233
Anne: Well, do me
a favor and try, okay?

1:09:32.267 --> 1:09:33.767
Rick: Yes.
Yes.

1:09:33.800 --> 1:09:35.333
Grace: I can't remember
the last time

1:09:35.367 --> 1:09:36.467
I had homemade pie.

1:09:36.500 --> 1:09:37.567
It's so good.

1:09:37.600 --> 1:09:40.267
Anne: Well, there's plenty more
where that came from.

1:09:49.667 --> 1:09:52.167
Rick: Hey, Son.

1:09:55.800 --> 1:09:58.333
Luke: What are
you doing here?

1:09:58.733 --> 1:10:02.333
Rick: Wow, look at you.

1:10:02.367 --> 1:10:04.400
You're growing up fast.

1:10:04.433 --> 1:10:07.500
Luke: Yeah, if you
call 5 years fast.

1:10:11.833 --> 1:10:14.400
Rick: We got you
a little something.

1:10:14.433 --> 1:10:18.167
I don't know if
you remember this.

1:10:20.467 --> 1:10:24.233
Luke: That supposed to make
everything better?

1:10:24.267 --> 1:10:28.700
You think we can just hug it out
and pretend you're my dad again?

1:10:28.733 --> 1:10:30.467
Rick: That would be nice.

1:10:30.500 --> 1:10:32.700
Luke: It's not happening!

1:10:33.500 --> 1:10:36.267
Thanks for dropping by, Dad.

1:10:36.300 --> 1:10:38.367
See you again in
another 5 years.

1:10:38.400 --> 1:10:40.133
Anne: Luke, honey,
why don't you just sit down

1:10:40.167 --> 1:10:41.567
and have some pie with us?

1:10:41.600 --> 1:10:43.567
Rick: Luke.

1:10:43.600 --> 1:10:45.700
Luke: Just leave.

1:10:45.733 --> 1:10:48.200
We're better off without you.

1:10:51.833 --> 1:10:52.800
Rick: He hates me.

1:10:52.833 --> 1:10:54.233
Anne: No, no.

1:10:54.267 --> 1:10:56.333
He just needs time,
like you did.

1:10:56.367 --> 1:10:58.400
Just don't give up so easy.

1:10:58.433 --> 1:11:01.067
It's his turn now.

1:11:03.767 --> 1:11:06.200
Grace: I'm so proud of you.

1:12:14.167 --> 1:12:16.533
Rick: Luke?

1:12:21.433 --> 1:12:23.433
Look, bud.

1:12:25.267 --> 1:12:28.133
I just wanted to tell you
that I'm sorry.

1:12:30.433 --> 1:12:31.400
I know I messed up.

1:12:31.433 --> 1:12:33.600
I know--

1:12:34.533 --> 1:12:39.267
I know I wasn't
a good father.

1:12:44.233 --> 1:12:47.133
I'm not gonna ask
for your forgiveness.

1:12:47.167 --> 1:12:48.200
I know I don't deserve it.

1:12:48.233 --> 1:12:50.567
I just--

1:12:56.300 --> 1:12:59.667
I'm not gonna leave you
again, Luke, ever.

1:13:01.600 --> 1:13:06.100
I'm gonna be here
for you, Son, okay?

1:13:15.167 --> 1:13:18.300
Maybe sometime,
whenever you're ready,

1:13:18.333 --> 1:13:21.033
we can--

1:13:21.533 --> 1:13:24.167
we can just
sit and talk.

1:13:33.667 --> 1:13:35.667
I love you, Son.

1:14:09.567 --> 1:14:11.133
Anne: So?

1:14:11.167 --> 1:14:12.467
Rick: Yeah.

1:14:12.500 --> 1:14:14.533
Anne: Oh, good.

1:14:15.600 --> 1:14:18.100
Rick: We gotta get you home.

1:14:18.133 --> 1:14:19.467
Can I borrow the car, Mom?

1:14:19.500 --> 1:14:21.733
Anne: Well, of course.
Let me just find the keys.

1:14:25.300 --> 1:14:26.567
Rick: Thank you.

1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:27.700
Grace: For what?

1:14:27.733 --> 1:14:29.500
Rick: You know what for.

1:14:29.533 --> 1:14:34.467
For just being you,
and you know,

1:14:34.500 --> 1:14:37.133
just for everything.

1:14:37.167 --> 1:14:39.267
Grace: Of course.

1:14:39.633 --> 1:14:40.767
Anne: Here they are.
Rick: Thank you.

1:14:40.800 --> 1:14:42.167
Anne: And your coat.

1:14:42.200 --> 1:14:43.733
Rick: Okay.
Anne: All right.

1:14:43.767 --> 1:14:45.700
Well, Grace, I do not know
where you came from,

1:14:45.733 --> 1:14:47.333
but do not be a stranger,

1:14:47.367 --> 1:14:50.133
'cause you are welcome here
any time.

1:14:50.167 --> 1:14:52.467
Grace: Thank you.

1:14:54.433 --> 1:14:55.567
Rick: I'll be back soon,
okay, Mom?

1:14:55.600 --> 1:14:56.700
Anne: All right.
Rick: All right.

1:14:56.733 --> 1:14:58.100
Anne: Love you.
Rick: Love you.

1:14:58.133 --> 1:14:59.267
Grace: Good bye.

1:14:59.300 --> 1:15:00.467
Anne: Bye-bye.

1:15:00.500 --> 1:15:02.500
Drive safely now.

a left right up here.

1:15:44.433 --> 1:15:46.333
Rick: A left?

1:15:50.500 --> 1:15:52.233
What are we doing here?

1:15:52.267 --> 1:15:54.333
I thought you said that we're
gonna go see your family today.

1:15:54.367 --> 1:15:56.100
Grace: We are.

1:16:31.600 --> 1:16:34.033
Grace: Come, I want you
to meet my family.

1:16:34.067 --> 1:16:36.367
Rick: Okay.

1:16:45.733 --> 1:16:48.367
I don't know what to say, Grace.

1:16:51.133 --> 1:16:55.000
Grace: My husband
never made it back from war.

1:16:57.400 --> 1:17:01.733
He was killed not long
after Tommy drowned.

1:17:04.667 --> 1:17:06.700
Rick: I'm so sorry.

1:17:07.467 --> 1:17:10.267
Grace: I miss my babies.

1:17:12.467 --> 1:17:15.100
Happy Thanksgiving, Tom.

1:17:17.467 --> 1:17:20.100
This is Rick.

1:17:22.400 --> 1:17:26.500
If it wasn't for him, I probably
wouldn't be here today.

1:17:34.433 --> 1:17:37.433
Rick: Grace, the date
that your husband died,

1:17:38.133 --> 1:17:39.500
that's the day--

1:17:39.533 --> 1:17:42.400
Grace: Yeah,
5 years ago today.

1:17:44.533 --> 1:17:47.400
Rick: That's a sign,
isn't it?

1:17:50.500 --> 1:17:53.567
Everything that happened today
was supposed to happen.

1:17:53.600 --> 1:17:56.500
Right, Grace?

1:17:56.533 --> 1:18:00.367
Just like you said,
nothing happens by accident.

1:18:06.700 --> 1:18:09.733
That's God, right?

1:18:10.500 --> 1:18:13.400
Grace: I told you you had
to work on your lack of faith.

1:18:14.733 --> 1:18:17.767
Rick: You were right.

1:18:24.133 --> 1:18:26.533
You were right, Grace.

1:18:28.700 --> 1:18:31.233
Grace: My gosh.

1:18:31.267 --> 1:18:34.233
I can feel your heart
beating through your jacket.

1:18:34.267 --> 1:18:38.267
Rick: That's for you, Grace.

1:18:38.300 --> 1:18:41.067
That's for you.

1:19:06.067 --> 1:19:08.467
Rick: Hey, babe.

1:19:08.500 --> 1:19:11.433
I miss you.

1:19:13.300 --> 1:19:16.133
I met someone.

1:19:16.167 --> 1:19:19.133
Her name is Grace.

1:19:19.167 --> 1:19:21.267
We're just taking it day by day,

1:19:21.300 --> 1:19:25.267
but I got a good feeling
about it.

1:19:26.500 --> 1:19:29.800
I'm telling you this
because I can't help

1:19:29.833 --> 1:19:34.500
but think you were watching out
for me this whole time,

1:19:34.533 --> 1:19:37.667
and maybe this was
all your doing.

1:19:37.700 --> 1:19:40.233
Luke: Hey, Dad, come on!

1:19:41.633 --> 1:19:44.767
Rick: Anyway, I gotta go.

1:19:44.800 --> 1:19:48.267
I'm playing catch with our son.

1:19:50.400 --> 1:19:54.567
We'll talk again soon,
I promise.

1:19:57.833 --> 1:20:00.567
I love you.

* Like a winter
turns to spring *

1:21:37.300 --> 1:21:40.733
* Like the first beat
of a heart *

1:21:40.767 --> 1:21:44.300

1:21:44.333 --> 1:21:50.533

1:21:50.567 --> 1:21:58.100
* A winding road that I
can't wait to follow *

1:22:39.067 --> 1:22:42.633

but then *

1:22:42.667 --> 1:22:47.533
* Suddenly, there you are

1:22:49.067 --> 1:22:56.133

a saving grace *

1:23:32.233 --> 1:23:36.067
