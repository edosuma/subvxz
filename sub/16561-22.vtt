WEBVTT

00:01.813 --> 00:04.078
- You look good.
- Stop.

00:09.855 --> 00:13.433
I've just been worried about you.

00:14.227 --> 00:16.760
Things are going well?

00:17.141 --> 00:19.585
No more rats since they
put me on the risperidone.

00:19.610 --> 00:21.867
That's... that's good. That's good.

00:21.892 --> 00:22.930
So you're feeling better, then?

00:22.955 --> 00:26.467
Yeah.
And I want to get the hell out of here.

00:26.492 --> 00:28.792
[sighs]

00:28.817 --> 00:32.289
Robin, there's something
that I have to tell you.

00:35.562 --> 00:37.996
The reason why you're in here...

00:38.021 --> 00:40.578
I asked your father to check in on you.

00:40.603 --> 00:42.328
I had no idea that he
would do something like...

00:42.353 --> 00:44.352
It's not your fault.

00:45.330 --> 00:48.141
You couldn't have known he'd do this.

00:48.725 --> 00:51.025
It's not all bad.

00:51.360 --> 00:53.360
Hey, they let me use the shower.

00:53.385 --> 00:55.885
Not without supervision, though.

00:55.911 --> 00:59.109
They are worried about suicide in here,

00:59.134 --> 01:01.868
so no shoelaces, no belts.

01:01.893 --> 01:05.194
See the sink? No faucet.

01:05.218 --> 01:08.508
Evidently, if you wrap your gown
around your neck just right,

01:08.533 --> 01:10.566
you can use it to strangle yourself.

01:10.635 --> 01:12.201
You don't belong in here.

01:12.270 --> 01:14.437
Not according to the petition Dad filed.

01:14.506 --> 01:17.183
Article 6 of the Mental
Health and Disabilities Code.

01:17.208 --> 01:20.810
No. I'm serious, Robin.
So, you heard rats. So what?

01:20.879 --> 01:23.312
This is not the solution.

01:23.381 --> 01:25.348
What can I do?

01:27.000 --> 01:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:37.028 --> 01:39.407
Oh, I really appreciate your being here.

01:39.432 --> 01:41.245
Support from friends
and family is crucial

01:41.270 --> 01:42.936
for the therapeutic
process, so thank you.

01:42.961 --> 01:44.494
Committed against her will?

01:44.670 --> 01:47.037
She can't even shower by herself.

01:47.078 --> 01:48.932
That is some therapeutic process.

01:48.957 --> 01:52.057
I think we all wish this
could've happened differently,

01:52.082 --> 01:54.767
but, you know, at least she's
getting the care that she needs,

01:54.792 --> 01:55.714
and she's safe and secure.

01:55.739 --> 01:57.505
No. She's locked up.

01:57.649 --> 01:59.048
In prison.

01:59.117 --> 02:01.150
It's not the same thing.

02:05.485 --> 02:08.586
This place is what is
gonna drive her crazy.

02:08.610 --> 02:10.244
She needs to be out of here.

02:16.193 --> 02:22.123
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:28.423 --> 02:30.093
- Good morning, Nat.
- Morning.

02:30.118 --> 02:31.929
Hey, Natalie, have you seen Reese?

02:31.954 --> 02:34.286
No. Sorry. Hey, how's Robin doing?

02:34.311 --> 02:35.162
I've been meaning to ask, but...

02:35.187 --> 02:36.428
I know... it's a delicate situation.

02:36.453 --> 02:38.030
She's dealing. Yeah.

02:38.055 --> 02:39.850
Well, if you need
anything, just please ask.

02:39.875 --> 02:41.741
- Thanks.
- Okay.

02:43.665 --> 02:46.466
April, today's match day.
Did Noah land here at Med?

02:46.491 --> 02:48.937
Texted him a dozen times. No response.

02:48.962 --> 02:50.361
They're only taking one local student,

02:50.386 --> 02:51.711
so that makes me think he didn't get it.

02:51.736 --> 02:53.456
Or maybe he just wants
to tell you in person.

02:53.481 --> 02:54.953
No news could be good news, too.

02:54.978 --> 02:57.578
Let's hope. <i>Barboleta branca.</i>

02:58.276 --> 03:00.509
It means "white
butterfly" in Portuguese.

03:00.534 --> 03:02.834
Yeah, that doesn't clear things up.

03:02.931 --> 03:04.864
It's a Brazilian superstition.

03:04.889 --> 03:07.483
So, if the first butterfly
you see in the year is white,

03:07.508 --> 03:08.540
it's good luck.

03:08.565 --> 03:10.198
I saw one a few weeks ago.

03:10.223 --> 03:12.117
Technically,
doesn't that only bring you luck?

03:12.142 --> 03:13.805
Wouldn't Noah need to
have seen this white...

03:13.830 --> 03:16.430
Seriously? You really want
to analyze the cosmic power

03:16.455 --> 03:17.711
of an insect sighting?

03:17.736 --> 03:19.758
Probably an argument I don't win, huh?

03:19.783 --> 03:22.601
- [alarm sounds]
- Dr. Choi, incoming!

03:22.633 --> 03:24.666
Peds versus auto.
You're going to Baghdad. Courtney?

03:24.691 --> 03:27.803
Gary Foster, 32.
Tripped, and fell into oncoming traffic

03:27.828 --> 03:29.023
and got plowed by a taxi.

03:29.048 --> 03:31.790
GCS 15, vitals stable,
16 gauge in the right AC.

03:31.815 --> 03:33.616
- Loss of consciousness?
- Yeah, briefly,

03:33.641 --> 03:35.211
but he was talking by
the time we got there.

03:35.236 --> 03:37.053
Wanted to make sure no
one blames the cab driver

03:37.078 --> 03:38.055
for what happened.

03:38.080 --> 03:39.897
It was my fault. I felt myself falling.

03:39.922 --> 03:41.102
I just couldn't stop it.

03:41.127 --> 03:42.593
It's okay, Mr. Foster.
It was an accident.

03:42.618 --> 03:45.285
Let's transfer on my
count. One, two, three.

03:45.310 --> 03:48.164
[cries out]

03:52.777 --> 03:54.610
Breath sounds clear and
present bilaterally.

03:54.635 --> 03:58.265
BP 122/70. Heart rate 112. Sats 100%.

03:58.290 --> 04:00.680
Let's roll him off the board slowly.

04:00.705 --> 04:02.438
Easy.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.726
[cries out]

04:05.751 --> 04:08.164
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Good God! That hurts!

04:08.189 --> 04:11.133
Okay, Mr. Foster, listen
to me close, okay?

04:11.158 --> 04:12.324
- Okay.
- Can you touch your chin

04:12.349 --> 04:13.715
to your chest?

04:13.740 --> 04:15.973
Good, good, good. Now left to right.

04:18.939 --> 04:21.572
Good. C-spine's clear.
We can lose the collar.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.698
All right, April,
50 of fentanyl for the pain.

04:25.731 --> 04:27.765
Let's get X-rays.
Chest, pelvis, left humerus.

04:27.790 --> 04:29.035
I also want a CT head,
abdomen, and pelvis,

04:29.060 --> 04:30.626
and let's get an EKG.

04:30.715 --> 04:32.903
- This is bad, isn't it?
- Just try to stay calm,

04:32.928 --> 04:34.495
- Mr. Foster.
- Okay.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.848
It's okay. We're gonna help you.

04:39.087 --> 04:41.348
Reese, you got a second?

04:41.373 --> 04:43.098
Uh, so, I just saw Robin.

04:43.123 --> 04:44.770
It seems like her therapy's going well.

04:44.795 --> 04:46.499
It is. It is. She is lucid

04:46.524 --> 04:48.123
and responding to her medication.

04:48.148 --> 04:50.015
Most importantly,
she is letting us help her.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.548
I wasn't sure she'd be so trusting,

04:51.573 --> 04:52.950
considering how this went down.

04:52.975 --> 04:54.400
So, she tells me that you guys are

04:54.425 --> 04:56.466
diagnosing this as schizophreniform.

04:56.491 --> 04:58.991
- Yeah, it's looking like that.
- Now, from what I've read,

04:59.016 --> 05:00.426
to be able to make that call,

05:00.451 --> 05:02.372
the symptoms have to last
for at least a month.

05:02.397 --> 05:04.567
Is that how long you guys
are planning on keeping her?

05:04.592 --> 05:07.074
Well, right now, it's
all about making sure

05:07.099 --> 05:08.926
her psychosis is under control

05:08.951 --> 05:10.820
and her meds are dosed appropriately.

05:10.845 --> 05:13.098
Anything about...
Thank you... release dates,

05:13.123 --> 05:14.887
you really should speak
with her attending.

05:14.912 --> 05:17.544
Right. Dr. Kwon. I actually did.

05:17.569 --> 05:19.918
He reminded me that
patience is a virtue.

05:19.943 --> 05:23.723
I'm pretty sure that Dr. Charles
put those words in his mouth.

05:28.448 --> 05:30.481
Reese, this is all messed up.

05:30.550 --> 05:33.030
I'm sorry, Connor, but I don't
know what you want me to say.

05:33.055 --> 05:35.437
If Robin had been committed in Indiana,

05:35.462 --> 05:36.430
she'd be released already.

05:36.455 --> 05:37.828
Same with Michigan. Same with Wisconsin.

05:37.853 --> 05:39.586
All of those states have shorter holds.

05:39.611 --> 05:41.414
But this is Illinois,
and I don't make the laws.

05:41.439 --> 05:43.354
Tell me this couldn't be
treated as an outpatient basis.

05:43.379 --> 05:44.945
That's not up to me.

05:45.177 --> 05:48.311
Is she or is she not
a danger to herself?

05:48.336 --> 05:51.496
At this exact moment, no,
but it's not that simple.

05:51.521 --> 05:53.254
Yes, it is.

05:57.774 --> 06:01.138
Ah, so, what's the word?

06:01.276 --> 06:02.907
I matched my first choice.

06:02.932 --> 06:04.446
- Really?
- Emergency medicine.

06:04.471 --> 06:06.125
That's great! I'm so happy for you!

06:06.150 --> 06:08.555
Really? You got the Med spot?

06:09.049 --> 06:12.083
Knew you could do it.
I had my eye on you from the get-go.

06:14.069 --> 06:16.149
- Don't worry about Stohl.
- I won't.

06:16.174 --> 06:17.688
Does Natalie know?

06:17.713 --> 06:19.758
Not yet.
I was waiting to see where I wound up.

06:19.783 --> 06:20.711
Hm.

06:21.543 --> 06:22.809
Keoni?

06:23.237 --> 06:24.503
What did you do?

06:24.528 --> 06:25.758
- No clue.
- Jeff, with me.

06:25.783 --> 06:26.949
We're going to Treatment 2.

06:27.006 --> 06:29.657
Doing a DIY reno on a bar.

06:29.682 --> 06:32.116
Been tripping over
construction supplies all week.

06:32.141 --> 06:33.407
Must have twisted my ankle.

06:33.432 --> 06:35.565
Didn't notice till it got really bad.

06:36.066 --> 06:37.837
All right, let's take a look.

06:38.023 --> 06:41.258
Hop up there. Take a
look at this flat tire.

06:41.372 --> 06:43.139
These your construction boots?

06:43.164 --> 06:46.198
I'm Hawaiian, brah.
Slippers are multipurpose.

06:46.223 --> 06:47.889
You got a nail in your foot, dude.

06:47.914 --> 06:49.180
You're kidding?

06:49.838 --> 06:51.437
It doesn't hurt?

06:51.462 --> 06:53.813
Been barefoot or in
slippers since I could walk.

06:53.838 --> 06:56.352
Calluses so tough I
could walk on hot coals

06:56.377 --> 06:57.844
and wouldn't even flinch.

06:57.869 --> 06:59.729
Swing your foot up there for me.

06:59.754 --> 07:01.554
Let's get a CBC, a CMP, and a tetanus,

07:01.579 --> 07:03.375
and have Danny come down with
a portable X-ray machine.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.931
Okay. You've been living
in Chicago 20 years, Keoni.

07:05.956 --> 07:07.212
Put on some shoes.

07:07.237 --> 07:09.680
And give up the endless summer? Never.

07:12.852 --> 07:15.653
Hey, April. Bummer about Noah.

07:15.678 --> 07:17.164
- What?
- You didn't hear?

07:17.189 --> 07:18.555
Jeff got the Med spot.

07:18.723 --> 07:21.086
Oh. Well, good for him.

07:21.111 --> 07:22.977
I'm sure Noah matched somewhere great.

07:23.002 --> 07:26.110
[girl cries out]

07:26.135 --> 07:28.016
Her stomach's been hurting
her for a few days now,

07:28.041 --> 07:29.828
but an hour ago,
everything just went haywire.

07:29.853 --> 07:32.102
She's been screaming in pain.
She gets really confused.

07:32.127 --> 07:34.471
- Abdominal pelvic ultrasound.
- On it.

07:34.496 --> 07:37.328
Okay, Allison,
can you tell me exactly where it hurts?

07:37.353 --> 07:39.333
I just got braces put on last week.

07:39.358 --> 07:40.118
See the confusion?

07:40.143 --> 07:41.858
And her eyes... She can't even focus.

07:41.883 --> 07:44.481
It's called nystagmus.
Is she taking any drugs?

07:44.506 --> 07:46.401
- No. No, no, no.
- Has Allison started

07:46.426 --> 07:48.500
- menstruating?
- I don't know. Maybe.

07:48.525 --> 07:50.412
Is she sexually active?
Could she be pregnant?

07:50.437 --> 07:51.625
She's only 13!

07:51.650 --> 07:53.791
Look, I don't think so.
I'm just her stepdad, so...

07:53.816 --> 07:54.868
- Ali, baby!
- Oh, baby.

07:54.893 --> 07:56.545
I'm sorry. I came as fast as I could.

07:56.570 --> 07:58.157
- Baby, what's happening?
- [Allison whimpering]

07:58.182 --> 07:59.983
I don't understand.
She said she was feeling better

08:00.008 --> 08:01.181
when I left for work.

08:01.206 --> 08:02.805
Not seeing any free fluids,

08:02.830 --> 08:05.008
no ovarian abnormalities.

08:05.033 --> 08:08.569
All right, let's do a CBC,
CMP, chest X-ray, cultures,

08:08.594 --> 08:10.938
head CT, tox screen, blood and urine,

08:10.963 --> 08:12.313
and a serum pregnancy.

08:12.338 --> 08:14.506
Wait, pregnancy? What? No.
Ali is still a virgin.

08:14.531 --> 08:16.235
She hasn't even started
talking about boys yet.

08:16.260 --> 08:18.289
I understand, but these
are standard tests.

08:18.314 --> 08:20.214
We just need to run
them to be safe, okay?

08:20.239 --> 08:22.147
Can you just give her
something for the pain, please?

08:22.172 --> 08:23.384
I'm sorry, but we can't do that

08:23.409 --> 08:25.274
until the tests are finished.

08:25.299 --> 08:27.864
- Baby, what's going on, huh?
- Keep away from me!

08:27.889 --> 08:30.063
We will figure this out, okay?
I'll be back shortly.

08:30.088 --> 08:31.654
[whimpering]

08:33.092 --> 08:35.726
[grunts]

08:36.373 --> 08:38.366
I can grab you some more
pillows if you need them.

08:38.392 --> 08:40.508
If it were only that easy.

08:40.533 --> 08:43.563
Mr. Foster, I got your X-rays and scans.

08:43.587 --> 08:45.688
There are multiple
fractures on your left side.

08:45.713 --> 08:48.429
L1 through L4 of your spine,
humerus, pelvis, and ribs.

08:48.461 --> 08:50.421
Good news is they won't require surgery.

08:50.446 --> 08:52.875
- They'll heal on their own.
- How long will that take?

08:52.931 --> 08:54.731
On average, six to eight weeks.

08:54.756 --> 08:57.460
After that,
between rehab and physical therapy,

08:57.485 --> 08:59.885
likely a year before you're
back to full strength.

08:59.910 --> 09:04.352
A year. Might as well be forever.

09:04.691 --> 09:06.758
Now, there is one more injury.

09:06.914 --> 09:10.355
The head CT revealed a
left-sided subdural hematoma

09:10.380 --> 09:11.539
and skull fracture.

09:11.572 --> 09:13.024
Our neurosurgeon, Dr. Abrams,

09:13.049 --> 09:14.343
wants to schedule surgery immediately.

09:14.368 --> 09:16.602
What happens if I decline?

09:16.888 --> 09:20.313
Mr. Foster,
you're bleeding inside your brain.

09:20.480 --> 09:23.024
If the pressure within
your skull isn't released,

09:23.049 --> 09:24.415
it will get worse.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.477
It's highly likely you'll die.

09:27.643 --> 09:29.626
I'm already dying.

09:30.766 --> 09:33.250
I have ALS.

09:33.384 --> 09:35.217
It's progressing rapidly.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.985
That's why I fell.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.516
By the time my bones heal,

09:39.805 --> 09:41.797
the disease will be ravaging me.

09:41.822 --> 09:43.696
Yeah, but you'll be alive.

09:43.721 --> 09:47.055
Barely. Confined to a wheelchair,

09:47.080 --> 09:49.555
hooked up to a ventilator.

09:50.302 --> 09:53.469
No. I don't want that.

09:53.494 --> 09:55.555
No surgery.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.476
I mean, there shouldn't
even be a debate.

10:05.501 --> 10:07.562
We can save Mr. Foster's life.

10:07.587 --> 10:10.227
I understand, April, but unfortunately,

10:10.252 --> 10:11.930
that's not the issue.

10:11.955 --> 10:13.688
His hematoma's worsening.

10:13.757 --> 10:15.990
He's gonna bleed to death. At this rate,

10:16.059 --> 10:18.204
he's got a couple weeks at best...
we have to act.

10:18.229 --> 10:20.730
We can't. I've studied Mr. Foster's

10:20.755 --> 10:24.290
advanced directives...
so has the hospital's legal council.

10:24.315 --> 10:25.915
It's ironclad.

10:25.940 --> 10:27.707
So, that just makes
it okay to do nothing?

10:27.774 --> 10:30.422
April,
part of Mr. Foster's directive instructs

10:30.447 --> 10:33.962
that upon death,
his organs and tissues be donated.

10:33.987 --> 10:36.118
Clearly this isn't a rash decision,

10:36.143 --> 10:37.447
so what's the discussion?

10:37.472 --> 10:39.189
That we have to sit
by and watch a man die

10:39.214 --> 10:41.191
when we can easily extend his life.

10:41.216 --> 10:42.478
- It's wrong.
- Yeah, well,

10:42.503 --> 10:45.735
we may not agree with his decision,

10:45.760 --> 10:48.110
but it is his choice to make.

10:48.135 --> 10:50.302
Transfer the patient to the ICU.

10:51.323 --> 10:52.907
Sharon,

10:55.039 --> 10:56.372
I need a minute.

10:56.397 --> 10:57.897
Yes.

11:01.659 --> 11:03.225
Hey, update me on Allison?

11:03.513 --> 11:05.572
White count's moderately elevated,

11:05.597 --> 11:07.830
but her fever's rising,
and she's disinhibited

11:07.855 --> 11:09.776
with a decreased level of consciousness.

11:09.931 --> 11:12.594
- Drug overdose?
- Tox screen was negative,

11:12.619 --> 11:14.123
as was every other test...

11:14.148 --> 11:17.338
Pregnancy, urinalysis, chest X-ray, CT,

11:17.363 --> 11:18.663
pelvic ultrasound.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.387
Neurologic infection?

11:20.486 --> 11:22.586
Meningitis? Encephalitis? You get an LP?

11:22.611 --> 11:24.167
Just did. CSF was clear.

11:24.192 --> 11:25.714
Whatever this is, it's viral.

11:25.739 --> 11:26.854
The lab's running a PCR.

11:26.879 --> 11:29.022
- Okay. Keep me posted.
- Mm-hmm.

11:29.047 --> 11:31.596
Hey. Doris told me you
matched in Emergency Medicine.

11:31.651 --> 11:32.893
That's awesome.

11:32.918 --> 11:34.987
Way to go, Clarke. Good to have you.

11:35.012 --> 11:36.510
Thanks. Hey, um,

11:36.535 --> 11:37.951
there is something that
I've been meaning to talk...

11:37.976 --> 11:39.589
- [alarm beeping]
- Natalie!

11:39.614 --> 11:42.749
- She's seizing.
- Oh, my God, make it stop!

11:43.145 --> 11:44.815
- Two of ativan.
- Got it.

11:44.840 --> 11:48.885
Sats are dropping. 77. 76.

11:48.910 --> 11:52.268
Allison, can you feel this?

11:52.293 --> 11:53.912
I need to intubate.

11:56.186 --> 11:58.973
No drugs. Her jaw is loose.

12:01.360 --> 12:02.626
We're gonna fix this.

12:02.651 --> 12:03.979
- Okay, almost.
- Yeah.

12:04.830 --> 12:06.689
No, no, no, no, no...
You're gonna choke her!

12:06.714 --> 12:08.111
She won't be able to breathe otherwise.

12:08.136 --> 12:10.189
- I'm in.
- Okay. I got it. I got it.

12:10.214 --> 12:12.261
Secure the tube and start bagging.

12:12.286 --> 12:15.153
Stat chest X-ray and call up
to the pediatric ICU for a bed.

12:15.178 --> 12:18.143
Wait, ICU? What's going on with her?

12:22.552 --> 12:23.985
Hey, man. I got your labs.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.476
Good news only, please.

12:25.635 --> 12:27.338
Can I sit?

12:27.454 --> 12:29.010
Uh-oh.

12:29.927 --> 12:33.033
Everything's normal
except your blood glucose.

12:33.058 --> 12:34.691
It's extremely high.

12:34.716 --> 12:36.716
- Diabetes.
- Yes.

12:36.741 --> 12:38.741
I'm gonna start you on
IV fluids and insulin

12:38.766 --> 12:40.399
and order hemoglobin A1C,

12:40.424 --> 12:42.157
Get a better reading
on your sugar levels.

12:42.182 --> 12:44.890
Diabetes can make your feet numb.

12:45.397 --> 12:47.831
That's why I didn't realize I
had a nail in my foot, isn't it?

12:47.856 --> 12:49.369
Yeah.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.197
I've been sick for a while.

12:51.222 --> 12:53.784
Look. The important thing: we caught it.

12:53.809 --> 12:55.494
Some lifestyle
adjustments, and you'll get

12:55.519 --> 12:56.751
way out ahead of this thing.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.654
Yeah, sure.

12:59.666 --> 13:01.854
Look, I get it. Change isn't easy,

13:01.879 --> 13:03.946
but in the long run, it's the only way.

13:05.758 --> 13:07.157
I'm gonna page Endocrinology,

13:07.182 --> 13:08.533
have them come down for a consult.

13:08.558 --> 13:10.792
They should be able to
answer all your questions.

13:18.823 --> 13:21.524
- Hey.
- Allison's LP results.

13:21.549 --> 13:23.415
Encephalitis.

13:23.440 --> 13:25.622
Oh, my God. HSE?

13:25.655 --> 13:28.923
Yeah. Fever, neuro issues,
seizures, now the coma...

13:28.948 --> 13:30.466
Virus fits the symptoms.

13:30.491 --> 13:32.104
Yeah.

13:32.630 --> 13:35.172
I just didn't see it coming.
I mean, she's 13.

13:35.198 --> 13:36.987
Herpes?

13:43.354 --> 13:45.621
[alarms beeping]

13:45.646 --> 13:48.167
- April!
- [coughing]

13:48.192 --> 13:50.613
BP's falling. 94/66.

13:50.638 --> 13:52.363
Heart's racing. Pulse is 120.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.281
All right, lungs are wet. Sats?

13:54.306 --> 13:58.401
[labored breathing, coughing]

13:58.426 --> 13:59.847
Can't get a reading.

14:00.905 --> 14:03.374
Fingers are swollen, purple.
Pulse ox monitor can't register.

14:03.399 --> 14:04.932
Get a blood gas.

14:06.622 --> 14:08.987
Toes are purple. Earlobes, too.

14:09.012 --> 14:10.665
Blood in the eyes, nasal passage.

14:10.690 --> 14:12.534
- What's happening?
- Your circulation's

14:12.559 --> 14:14.128
being cut off... oxygen's not
moving well through your body.

14:14.153 --> 14:15.726
- Why?
- I'm not sure.

14:15.751 --> 14:18.800
PCO 256, PAO 255.

14:18.988 --> 14:21.651
All right,
let's increase the oxygen to 10 liters.

14:22.356 --> 14:24.815
[labored breathing]

14:24.840 --> 14:27.081
April?

14:27.105 --> 14:29.487
Is he still being
transferred to the ICU?

14:29.512 --> 14:30.945
Hold off for now.

14:30.970 --> 14:33.401
[coughing]

14:33.426 --> 14:34.877
Let's test for DIC.

14:34.902 --> 14:36.323
If that's what we're seeing,

14:36.348 --> 14:37.738
I think there may be
a way to convince Gary

14:37.763 --> 14:39.262
to fix his brain bleed.

14:43.554 --> 14:45.982
Oh, hey, were you looking for me?

14:46.537 --> 14:49.342
Please join us, Dr. Charles.

14:56.139 --> 14:59.048
This is Nicole Jansen of Shipley...

14:59.073 --> 15:01.029
Shipley Austin & Shea.

15:01.054 --> 15:04.053
I'm representing the
interests of Robin Charles.

15:04.187 --> 15:05.653
Lawyers?

15:05.678 --> 15:07.745
I'm hoping you can provide some clarity

15:07.770 --> 15:11.090
on the circumstances surrounding
Ms. Charles's involuntary hold.

15:11.115 --> 15:12.848
I don't see how it's not clear.

15:12.931 --> 15:15.531
A petition was filed in
accordance with state law.

15:15.556 --> 15:17.926
And within 24 hours,
Dr. Kwon here signed...

15:17.951 --> 15:20.489
I will get to Dr. Kwon.
First, I want to talk

15:20.514 --> 15:22.967
about the filing of
the original petition

15:22.992 --> 15:24.475
by Dr. Charles,

15:24.500 --> 15:26.554
the hospital's Chief of Psychiatry,

15:26.579 --> 15:29.012
but also my client's father.

15:29.037 --> 15:31.311
Interesting.

15:39.780 --> 15:42.083
Allison has HSV type 2,

15:42.108 --> 15:44.037
which is more commonly associated

15:44.062 --> 15:45.820
with genital herpes than oral.

15:45.845 --> 15:49.209
Genital? No.

15:49.234 --> 15:51.724
Ali doesn't do that. And when?
Where? She's either at school

15:51.749 --> 15:53.147
or at home with one
of us... Right, Kevin?

15:53.172 --> 15:56.045
Yeah, look, I work from home.
Nothing's going on at the house.

15:56.070 --> 15:57.538
Okay, no boys come over, ever.

15:57.563 --> 15:59.423
I know girls don't tell
their mothers everything...

15:59.448 --> 16:03.183
God knows I didn't, but...
But Ali and me... we talk.

16:03.208 --> 16:05.303
Have you noticed any
change in Allison's mood

16:05.328 --> 16:07.540
or personality in the last few days?

16:07.565 --> 16:10.598
No. Besides being sick,
she's been her usual happy self.

16:10.623 --> 16:11.366
Why?

16:11.391 --> 16:13.747
Allison's abdominal pain is inconsistent

16:13.772 --> 16:15.889
with the HSE diagnosis,

16:16.109 --> 16:18.729
and it may be a sign of sexual assault.

16:20.530 --> 16:22.998
We'd like to perform a
more extensive pelvic exam

16:23.023 --> 16:24.422
just to be sure.

16:24.447 --> 16:26.232
Is that really necessary?
I mean, come on,

16:26.257 --> 16:27.990
it's not gonna have any effect
on how you treat her, is it?

16:28.015 --> 16:30.095
There might be some internal
damaging and bleeding

16:30.120 --> 16:31.764
that needs to be repaired,

16:31.789 --> 16:35.053
and it is possible she may
have contracted another STD.

16:35.078 --> 16:37.467
Look, can it just wait?
Can it wait until we...

16:37.492 --> 16:38.530
just have a moment to figure out...

16:38.555 --> 16:40.002
It's okay.

16:40.453 --> 16:43.356
It's okay.
You can... You can perform the exam.

16:43.381 --> 16:45.319
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

16:45.344 --> 16:47.635
Um, if this is that,

16:47.660 --> 16:50.693
- I need to kn... I'm sorry.
- Babe. Baby...

16:51.132 --> 16:53.142
We'll get started right away.

17:00.880 --> 17:02.947
I'll start Robin's discharge paperwork.

17:02.972 --> 17:04.472
Thank you.

17:08.738 --> 17:11.942
Hmm. Little heads-up,
you know, would've been nice.

17:11.967 --> 17:14.147
I found out just before you did.

17:14.173 --> 17:17.136
I mean, come on.
Rhodes's name's on the building,

17:17.161 --> 17:19.528
so he gets to decide
who's fit to be released?

17:19.553 --> 17:21.636
Is this a joke? Sharon, it's Robin!

17:21.863 --> 17:23.913
I thought that you guys would at
least go to the wall for Robin.

17:23.938 --> 17:27.361
Daniel,
if we don't make a deal in this room,

17:27.386 --> 17:30.625
the next place we'll meet
will be in front of a judge

17:30.650 --> 17:34.522
with Robin and a team of
doctors that they've assembled

17:34.547 --> 17:36.553
to challenge our every move.

17:36.578 --> 17:38.544
That's not good for anyone,

17:38.569 --> 17:40.335
especially for you.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.648
Okay, well, then,
I appreciate you looking out for me.

17:42.673 --> 17:45.656
Daniel. Daniel, come on.

17:46.230 --> 17:48.561
- Thank you very much.
- Absolutely.

17:48.586 --> 17:49.906
Dr. Charles, don't. It'll just start...

17:49.930 --> 17:52.225
Not now, not now. Hey, Connor. Connor.

17:52.251 --> 17:54.257
I'm just curious. So, you're the one

17:54.282 --> 17:55.825
who's gonna be taking care of Robin now?

17:55.850 --> 17:57.100
- Yeah.
- I mean,

17:57.125 --> 17:58.265
you're a surgical fellow, buddy.

17:58.290 --> 17:59.812
You work in 36-hour shifts.

17:59.837 --> 18:01.406
Uh-huh, so I'll adjust my schedule

18:01.430 --> 18:02.343
and we'll make it work.

18:02.368 --> 18:04.773
But what happens next time
she has a psychotic break?

18:04.798 --> 18:05.804
I mean, even if you're home,

18:05.829 --> 18:07.070
you're not equipped to deal with it.

18:07.095 --> 18:10.039
Every second that she
spends in that ward,

18:10.063 --> 18:11.702
her resentment towards you grows.

18:11.727 --> 18:13.429
Can't you see that I'm
trying to do you a favor?

18:13.453 --> 18:16.327
- Don't do me any favors! Don't!
- Oh, look, I came to you

18:16.352 --> 18:18.881
out of concern for Robin, not panic!

18:18.906 --> 18:20.101
And you escalated things!

18:20.126 --> 18:22.421
You don't have a clue
what you are dealing with.

18:22.446 --> 18:24.616
Is this some kind of game to you
where you get to be the hero?

18:24.641 --> 18:25.155
Is that what it is?

18:25.180 --> 18:26.296
No, this is not a game.

18:26.321 --> 18:28.624
You made a mess, and I'm fixing it.

18:28.649 --> 18:31.733
Right. By bringing in Daddy's big guns.
Well done.

18:31.759 --> 18:34.026
She is not a little girl anymore.

18:34.347 --> 18:37.429
Okay? You can't make up for
your own failings as a father

18:37.454 --> 18:39.721
by treating her like one now!

18:39.887 --> 18:41.507
Give it up.

18:48.403 --> 18:52.038
Allison's pelvic exam yielded
evidence of vaginal trauma:

18:52.077 --> 18:54.288
perforated hymen, mucosal tears,

18:54.313 --> 18:56.123
severe edema, swelling...

18:56.148 --> 18:58.241
All clear evidence of sexual assault.

18:58.266 --> 19:01.460
- Timeline?
- The status of the bruising

19:01.485 --> 19:04.726
indicates the trauma took place
about five to seven days ago,

19:04.751 --> 19:07.627
consistent with the incubation
period of the encephalitis.

19:07.652 --> 19:09.402
Poor baby.

19:09.432 --> 19:12.616
All right, I'll activate the
rape protocols and notify PD.

19:12.641 --> 19:15.192
- This case is now a crime.
- Okay.

19:15.217 --> 19:16.999
We'll talk to the parents
about what comes next.

19:17.024 --> 19:19.038
- All right.
- Thanks, Ms. Goodwin.

19:19.063 --> 19:20.362
Mm-hmm.

19:27.872 --> 19:31.921
[soft indistinct speech]

19:45.317 --> 19:47.083
Where are you going?

19:47.108 --> 19:48.908
Gonna go get some fresh air.

19:48.933 --> 19:51.605
With your clothes over your arm?

19:53.468 --> 19:56.863
I've seen too many people skip
out after getting bad news.

19:57.177 --> 19:59.285
It never ends well.

20:00.149 --> 20:02.291
What does it matter
if I stay or if I go?

20:02.316 --> 20:03.441
The results are the same.

20:03.466 --> 20:05.266
I doubt that.

20:08.869 --> 20:11.103
- Move.
- No chance.

20:14.287 --> 20:17.221
So, where does that leave us?

20:22.566 --> 20:24.876
I'm scared.

20:32.072 --> 20:34.075
It's okay.

20:35.113 --> 20:36.546
Come on back.

20:36.774 --> 20:39.184
I know someone you should talk to.

20:39.380 --> 20:43.786
- A shrink?
- [laughs] Something like that.

20:56.071 --> 20:58.438
The trauma nurse won't let
me be in there with her.

20:58.463 --> 21:00.986
It's protocol,
just while they're collecting evidence.

21:01.011 --> 21:02.589
It won't be long, though.

21:02.837 --> 21:04.939
I'm gonna go get a cup of coffee.
You want one?

21:04.964 --> 21:06.430
No.

21:08.891 --> 21:10.574
Wait, wait. Can I ask you...

21:10.598 --> 21:12.354
Can I ask you something, Dr. Manning?

21:12.379 --> 21:14.526
Of course.

21:15.635 --> 21:17.735
Could you be having
unprotected sex regularly

21:17.760 --> 21:20.456
with someone with
herpes and not catch it?

21:21.121 --> 21:24.055
Not even...
not even be aware that they have it?

21:24.124 --> 21:25.702
Yes.

21:27.842 --> 21:29.698
I don't want to believe
it could be true,

21:29.723 --> 21:32.490
but the only person who was
alone with Ali in the past week

21:32.515 --> 21:33.795
was Kevin.

21:35.164 --> 21:37.909
I can't think of anyone
else it might've been.

21:39.276 --> 21:41.994
Ms. Nicholson,
you can be with your daughter now.

21:42.019 --> 21:43.885
Thank you.

21:45.718 --> 21:48.236
I'm just being paranoid, right?

21:57.308 --> 21:59.475
I suppose I can't talk to the
girl for some time, right?

21:59.500 --> 22:04.445
No. Um, the mom thinks the
stepdad might've done it.

22:04.595 --> 22:07.062
Wouldn't surprise me.
That's where I was gonna start.

22:07.431 --> 22:10.657
Seriously, Jay,
I don't know how you go to work

22:10.682 --> 22:12.795
and do this every day.

22:12.820 --> 22:15.626
I could say the same thing for you.

22:19.107 --> 22:21.300
[phone buzzes]

22:21.325 --> 22:23.058
I got to take this.

22:29.004 --> 22:31.812
My feet are cold.

22:32.337 --> 22:34.504
I'll get you some more blankets.

22:34.529 --> 22:36.624
Everything hurts.

22:36.649 --> 22:40.280
It's from Disseminated
Intravascular Coagulation, DIC.

22:40.536 --> 22:44.033
Clots are forming inside your vessels,
blocking blood flow

22:44.674 --> 22:46.707
and depriving you of oxygen.

22:46.869 --> 22:48.911
Your organs are failing.

22:49.479 --> 22:51.472
Unfortunately, in this condition,

22:51.497 --> 22:53.707
they're not suitable for transplant.

22:53.848 --> 22:58.144
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I won't be able to donate?

22:58.169 --> 22:59.378
No.

23:00.335 --> 23:02.933
There's got to be something you can do.

23:03.544 --> 23:05.644
Mr. Foster,

23:05.791 --> 23:08.408
if you allow us to
operate on the hematoma,

23:08.433 --> 23:11.025
that puts us in a better
position to treat the DIC.

23:11.050 --> 23:13.909
No. Then we're back to where we started.

23:13.934 --> 23:17.097
I'm laying here with broken
bones that won't heal

23:17.122 --> 23:19.317
before I'm locked up on life support.

23:20.017 --> 23:24.386
Listen,
you can't let my organs die before I do.

23:24.411 --> 23:26.244
Please.

23:31.869 --> 23:34.207
There is a fix for the DIC.

23:34.579 --> 23:37.813
Heparin. It's a drug
that prevents the clots

23:37.838 --> 23:39.835
from getting larger.

23:40.636 --> 23:43.698
Mr. Foster, heparin is a blood thinner,

23:43.723 --> 23:45.979
which means it will also
significantly worsen

23:46.004 --> 23:47.495
the bleeding in your brain.

23:47.520 --> 23:51.433
Instead of weeks to live,
you'll have only hours.

23:51.578 --> 23:54.104
Weeks weren't much, but...

23:54.982 --> 23:57.297
that gave me time to say good-byes.

23:57.322 --> 23:59.272
Hours, though.

24:00.172 --> 24:04.097
Mr. Foster,
if we're gonna start the heparin...

24:04.122 --> 24:05.406
The sooner, the better.

24:05.491 --> 24:07.024
Yeah.

24:08.834 --> 24:12.284
You don't have to do this.
You can change your mind.

24:15.349 --> 24:17.349
What would you like to do?

24:21.781 --> 24:24.048
Give me the heparin.

24:24.202 --> 24:26.051
Gary,

24:26.961 --> 24:28.969
are you sure?

24:31.656 --> 24:33.724
Yes.

24:35.147 --> 24:37.279
Okay. Excuse us.

24:37.304 --> 24:39.501
April!

24:39.898 --> 24:42.756
- We cannot do this, Ethan.
- He was clear in his decision.

24:42.781 --> 24:44.085
Because you pressured him,

24:44.110 --> 24:45.515
made him feel he had
to choose right now.

24:45.540 --> 24:46.872
No. I gave him his medical options,

24:46.897 --> 24:48.577
and he decided on what was best for him.

24:48.602 --> 24:49.801
Don't put this on me.

24:49.826 --> 24:51.243
It is on you.

24:52.171 --> 24:54.639
Your hands may have been tied
by his advance directive,

24:54.664 --> 24:56.431
but giving him heparin
knowing it's lethal,

24:56.456 --> 24:57.534
that's assisted suicide.

24:57.559 --> 24:59.667
April, we can't save Gary,

24:59.692 --> 25:02.069
but one organ donor can
save up to eight lives.

25:02.094 --> 25:04.905
One tissue donor can improve
the lives of up to 50 others.

25:04.930 --> 25:07.841
Because of him,
58 people get a second chance.

25:08.453 --> 25:10.556
Put in the order for heparin.

25:10.687 --> 25:12.315
No.

25:14.699 --> 25:17.063
Then I'll do it myself.

25:18.137 --> 25:21.686
[breathing heavily]

25:24.624 --> 25:26.678
This is everything you had
when you were admitted.

25:26.703 --> 25:28.671
Thank you.

25:35.454 --> 25:37.673
You can't hold me here any longer.

25:37.698 --> 25:39.288
I know.

25:39.873 --> 25:40.972
Look...

25:40.997 --> 25:43.031
Whatever you have to say,

25:43.056 --> 25:45.088
I don't want to hear it.

25:47.039 --> 25:48.855
I just want you to be safe, Robin.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.762
I'm going to be.

25:51.293 --> 25:53.473
With Connor.

26:06.470 --> 26:09.143
What is up, family?

26:09.168 --> 26:10.478
[clears throat]

26:10.503 --> 26:13.111
Matched at Chicago Med!

26:13.374 --> 26:16.709
Emergency Medicine, baby!

26:16.734 --> 26:19.234
Let's get it! April, we did it!

26:19.259 --> 26:22.093
What? I don't understand.
I thought Jeff got the match.

26:22.206 --> 26:25.228
What? No, no, no. It's official.

26:25.253 --> 26:26.892
Only one local spot at Med,
and it's all mine!

26:26.917 --> 26:28.784
Aah! [squeals]

26:28.833 --> 26:30.111
I'm home!

26:30.136 --> 26:35.181
I knew you'd do it.
Had my eye on you from the get-go.

26:38.266 --> 26:40.910
Hey, what's going on?

26:41.378 --> 26:43.545
I matched in Honolulu.

26:43.910 --> 26:46.149
Chicago Med wasn't even on my list.

26:47.908 --> 26:50.111
- Good luck, Clarke.
- Thanks.

26:50.584 --> 26:52.650
I just assumed...

26:53.228 --> 26:56.063
I mean, you must have known
about this for a while now.

26:56.088 --> 26:58.659
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you say anything?

26:58.684 --> 27:01.501
I don't know.
I just felt like it was time to move on.

27:02.768 --> 27:05.083
- Okay.
- Hey, Nat?

27:05.689 --> 27:07.862
Sorry, Jeff. I need her.
Will, can I grab you for a second?

27:07.887 --> 27:09.753
- Let's talk later?
- Yeah.

27:13.138 --> 27:15.508
I spoke to the parents
together and independently.

27:15.533 --> 27:17.352
- And?
- I don't like the stepdad

27:17.377 --> 27:19.415
for the guy...
He offered to give a polygraph

27:19.440 --> 27:20.947
and submit his DNA.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.664
Offenders don't usually behave that way.

27:22.689 --> 27:23.877
Any other leads?

27:23.902 --> 27:26.422
Allison's comprehensive
tox screen detected

27:26.447 --> 27:27.735
trace amounts of triazolam in her blood.

27:27.760 --> 27:29.002
That's a benzo, right?

27:29.027 --> 27:32.173
Yeah. A sedative hypnotic
with amnestic properties.

27:32.306 --> 27:33.424
The stepdad's an accountant.

27:33.449 --> 27:34.924
I don't see him getting
his hands on that.

27:34.949 --> 27:36.517
Unless maybe he was prescribed it.

27:36.542 --> 27:38.353
I mean, it is sometimes
used for insomnia.

27:38.378 --> 27:39.619
Yeah, it definitely puts you out.

27:39.644 --> 27:41.686
The hospital uses it mostly
to treat patient anxiety,

27:41.711 --> 27:44.408
usually before procedures,
MRI scans, things like that.

27:44.433 --> 27:45.642
So, she could've gotten it here.

27:45.667 --> 27:47.070
Did you give it to her
before the CT scan?

27:47.095 --> 27:48.970
- No.
- No.

27:49.248 --> 27:51.148
Another doctor then, maybe.

27:51.263 --> 27:53.689
Did the mom mention any
other recent medical issues?

27:53.714 --> 27:55.720
No. Nothing other than the symptoms

27:55.745 --> 27:57.311
that brought her in today.

27:59.181 --> 28:01.058
Braces.

28:01.468 --> 28:04.017
Allison did just get her braces on.

28:05.429 --> 28:08.563
Dentists also sometimes use triazolam.

28:13.803 --> 28:17.790
After you pass,
you'll immediately be taken into the OR

28:17.815 --> 28:20.703
where your organs and
tissues will be recovered.

28:20.844 --> 28:23.314
When that happens, will it hurt?

28:23.339 --> 28:24.580
No.

28:24.708 --> 28:27.943
The bleeding in your brain
will starve it of oxygen.

28:28.401 --> 28:30.861
You'll lose consciousness,

28:30.982 --> 28:35.017
and then you'll shut down.

28:35.078 --> 28:38.290
- I'll be dead.
- Your brain will be.

28:38.315 --> 28:40.556
But your body will still be alive.

28:40.697 --> 28:43.337
But you won't be able to
control your breathing.

28:43.776 --> 28:47.517
The organs still need oxygen,
though, so we need...

28:47.542 --> 28:50.384
You want to adjust my advance directive.

28:50.612 --> 28:52.523
Just the DNI.

28:52.697 --> 28:55.595
We need your consent to intubate you

28:55.633 --> 28:57.806
once you lose consciousness

28:57.831 --> 29:01.493
to protect the organs
until you get into the OR.

29:02.043 --> 29:04.400
Do we have your permission?

29:04.851 --> 29:07.986
Yes. Mm-hmm.

29:08.011 --> 29:09.678
Okay.

29:17.426 --> 29:20.148
Right there.

29:37.993 --> 29:40.531
You think I'm making a mistake.

29:49.840 --> 29:53.973
Earlier this year, I
suffered a miscarriage.

29:54.354 --> 29:57.218
My child never got a chance at life.

29:57.917 --> 30:00.925
I would give anything just...

30:01.702 --> 30:03.595
for one moment.

30:05.120 --> 30:07.613
You may not have as much time as others,

30:07.638 --> 30:11.186
but you still have <i> some.</i>

30:11.460 --> 30:13.854
I'm sorry for your loss.

30:14.809 --> 30:17.358
But my time is over.

30:18.319 --> 30:23.776
The only positive is my
death can help other people.

30:25.018 --> 30:27.206
I know...

30:27.977 --> 30:30.540
It looks like I'm giving up,

30:31.694 --> 30:36.166
but this is everything
I've been living for.

30:43.598 --> 30:45.398
This is it.

30:45.423 --> 30:49.089
- [takes deep breath]
- Yeah.

30:49.950 --> 30:52.187
Okay.

30:52.818 --> 30:54.520
I'm ready.

30:59.109 --> 31:01.843
Hanging meds is a
nurse's responsibility.

31:01.868 --> 31:03.907
I will do it.

31:29.943 --> 31:34.094
Making a break for it, Keoni? Really?

31:34.381 --> 31:36.381
Seemed like a good idea at the time.

31:36.406 --> 31:38.522
Figured Maggie was
sending over a shrink.

31:38.617 --> 31:41.733
Oh, no. You get me.

31:41.873 --> 31:44.757
I appreciate the red carpet,
but there's nothing you can do.

31:44.913 --> 31:47.187
In the back of my mind,
I knew it was diabetes.

31:47.212 --> 31:48.812
I should've never come to the hospital.

31:48.843 --> 31:51.554
Because what? Denial is a good solution?

31:51.579 --> 31:52.976
You don't understand, Sharon.

31:53.001 --> 31:55.452
My family... diabetes kills.

31:55.477 --> 31:56.910
Now it's my turn.

31:56.935 --> 32:00.187
Your genetics don't doom you, Keoni.

32:00.212 --> 32:02.796
No? I eat healthy. I
don't drink the coladas

32:02.821 --> 32:04.249
or the daiquiris that I make at the bar.

32:04.274 --> 32:06.841
I exercise. Yet here I am.

32:06.866 --> 32:08.429
I did what I was supposed to do.

32:08.486 --> 32:09.812
Yeah, and unfortunately,

32:09.837 --> 32:12.499
people like you and I
have to do that and more

32:12.524 --> 32:13.991
to break the cycle.

32:14.016 --> 32:16.835
Yes, I have diabetes too.

32:17.194 --> 32:21.272
And I've lost family also.

32:21.366 --> 32:23.944
- I didn't know.
- Many don't.

32:24.374 --> 32:26.544
And it's not because I'm hiding it,

32:26.569 --> 32:30.647
but because I've got it under control,

32:30.672 --> 32:33.788
and I have for the last 14 years.

32:34.288 --> 32:39.140
There are people in this
hospital who have to surrender.

32:39.657 --> 32:42.024
You have an opportunity.

32:43.922 --> 32:46.022
You better take it.

33:21.066 --> 33:23.340
It's gonna be okay.

33:32.392 --> 33:34.587
Oh, Dr. Reese?

33:35.124 --> 33:37.124
If, um...

33:37.751 --> 33:40.446
If you would like to
continue your residency

33:40.471 --> 33:42.205
under a different attending,

33:42.230 --> 33:45.017
I would completely understand.

33:56.516 --> 34:00.853
Hey, Keoni.
Wanted to say good-bye. You good?

34:00.878 --> 34:02.865
Work in progress, but I'll get there.

34:02.890 --> 34:05.049
Heard you're taking
off for the sunshine.

34:05.321 --> 34:08.036
Oahu. You're my last patient.

34:08.062 --> 34:10.596
A native Hawaiian. Must be fate.

34:10.621 --> 34:12.322
You might be right.

34:12.949 --> 34:16.502
Uh, Ms. Goodwin wanted
you to have your nail.

34:18.702 --> 34:22.150
You know what? I don't need it.

34:22.176 --> 34:24.181
He ho'omaka hou 'ana.

34:24.449 --> 34:26.716
"A new beginning."

34:26.741 --> 34:28.650
You and me both.

34:29.121 --> 34:32.525
[chuckles]

34:35.648 --> 34:38.072
Yeah, we'll just have to wait.

34:42.856 --> 34:44.632
[sighs]

34:46.621 --> 34:51.672
Ohh, this view.
Oh, how I've missed this view.

34:52.587 --> 34:55.672
Or just <i> a</i> view.

34:59.119 --> 35:02.203
So, dinner.

35:02.577 --> 35:06.273
The pantry is... not really stocked.

35:06.298 --> 35:07.868
We could go out.

35:09.787 --> 35:11.430
Or order in.

35:11.502 --> 35:14.055
It's probably for the
best. Just for tonight.

35:14.181 --> 35:16.430
Look,

35:16.944 --> 35:19.359
I know you went out on a limb,

35:19.384 --> 35:20.984
so thank you.

35:21.518 --> 35:25.141
I'm just so happy to be out of there.

35:30.115 --> 35:32.289
Come here.

35:34.520 --> 35:37.727
Doctor? Doctor?

35:38.225 --> 35:40.807
- What is it?
- She's awake.

35:43.674 --> 35:45.823
Breathing trial looks good.

35:45.848 --> 35:48.065
I'm gonna take this
tube out, okay, Allison?

35:48.090 --> 35:49.815
All right.

35:51.638 --> 35:53.431
Ready?

35:54.316 --> 35:56.082
- [coughs]
- It's okay.

35:56.107 --> 35:58.588
Breathe, and there you go.

35:58.614 --> 36:00.510
Okay.

36:05.188 --> 36:07.456
Where am I?

36:07.706 --> 36:09.429
You got sick, honey.

36:09.454 --> 36:11.754
We had to take you to the hospital.

36:11.779 --> 36:14.049
How long am I gonna be here?

36:14.288 --> 36:16.299
I don't want to miss the school dance.

36:16.324 --> 36:17.932
[laughs]

36:17.957 --> 36:20.573
Oh, sweetie.

36:22.070 --> 36:24.479
Hi, baby.

36:25.775 --> 36:29.135
The orthodontist?
I was in the waiting room the whole time

36:29.160 --> 36:31.393
just checking my emails.

36:31.713 --> 36:33.814
When she came out, she smiled,
showed me her braces,

36:33.839 --> 36:35.269
didn't seem any different.

36:35.294 --> 36:38.620
The police suspect instead
of nitrous he used triazolam.

36:38.645 --> 36:41.213
It knocked her out, ensured she
had no memory of the assault.

36:41.238 --> 36:42.752
Sick bastard.

36:42.777 --> 36:44.932
I know this is a lot to process,

36:44.957 --> 36:47.317
but once Allison is stronger,
the detective would like

36:47.342 --> 36:49.142
to come in and ask her a few questions.

36:49.167 --> 36:51.190
Look, Ali just had a brush with death,

36:51.215 --> 36:52.714
and all she cares about is

36:52.739 --> 36:55.206
if she can still go to
the junior high dance.

36:55.231 --> 36:57.487
She's so innocent.

36:58.213 --> 37:00.651
I don't want to take that from her.

37:00.824 --> 37:04.682
One day we'll have to, but not today.

37:04.826 --> 37:06.667
We understand.

37:06.765 --> 37:09.807
We'll be back in the
morning to check on her.

37:09.832 --> 37:11.631
Good night.

37:16.917 --> 37:18.750
[exhales sharply]

37:30.027 --> 37:32.495
Jeff's locker's cleared
out, and he left.

37:32.520 --> 37:34.387
Yeah, about an hour ago.

37:34.412 --> 37:38.560
Did you know?
That he wanted to move on from Med?

37:38.796 --> 37:42.341
Yes. But I didn't know that you didn't.

37:44.599 --> 37:47.037
He left without even saying good-bye?

37:47.276 --> 37:48.675
That's not cool.

37:48.700 --> 37:51.591
No. It was the right play.

37:51.702 --> 37:54.102
The conversation about why

37:54.127 --> 37:56.360
wouldn't have done
either of us any good.

37:56.489 --> 37:57.794
Slips out in the night,

37:57.819 --> 37:59.952
and still somehow he
makes it chivalrous.

38:00.145 --> 38:02.169
I'm happy for Jeff.

38:02.293 --> 38:03.993
Fresh start.

38:04.018 --> 38:05.484
Yeah.

38:06.697 --> 38:07.796
Dr. Halstead.

38:07.821 --> 38:09.487
Night, Maggie.

38:09.512 --> 38:10.787
Nina and I are gonna
meet Jay at Molly's.

38:10.812 --> 38:12.519
- You want to join?
- Eh.

38:12.544 --> 38:14.501
Put this day behind us?

38:15.822 --> 38:18.505
Yeah. That sounds great.

38:18.530 --> 38:20.654
Uh, I just... I have
to do something first,

38:20.679 --> 38:22.012
so I'll meet you guys there.

38:22.037 --> 38:23.436
Okay.

38:46.510 --> 38:49.844
Gary's organ recovery went well.

38:50.687 --> 38:53.242
A lot of lives are being saved tonight.

38:55.216 --> 38:57.984
Just wish it felt more like a win.

39:00.367 --> 39:02.992
So much for white butterflies.

39:07.423 --> 39:10.685
I think we make our own luck anyway.

39:26.902 --> 39:29.079
I should get back to the ED.

39:29.104 --> 39:32.142
Yeah. Yeah.

39:32.167 --> 39:35.032
I'll... I'll see you tomorrow.

39:49.354 --> 39:52.292
[takes deep breath]

39:53.803 --> 39:57.097
So, then the guy says,
"If we would've done it my way,

39:57.122 --> 39:58.229
we could've walked out of here."

39:58.254 --> 39:59.840
[laughs]

39:59.865 --> 40:02.456
Oh, that's really horrible, Jay.

40:02.481 --> 40:04.373
Who told you that one?

40:04.398 --> 40:06.126
- Dad.
- I should've known.

40:06.151 --> 40:07.483
- Come on.
- Of course.

40:07.508 --> 40:09.690
- He's disgusting.
- [all chuckle]

40:09.715 --> 40:11.081
Whoa.

40:13.652 --> 40:15.831
Hey.

40:18.172 --> 40:19.683
Wow.

40:19.988 --> 40:21.386
Big change.

40:21.411 --> 40:24.542
Yeah.
I, um, felt like I needed something new.

40:24.567 --> 40:27.319
- Looks really nice.
- Thank you.

40:27.344 --> 40:29.198
Yeah, it looks great. I like it.

40:29.223 --> 40:31.894
Thanks. I'm glad. [laughs]

40:31.919 --> 40:33.714
Well, we all like it.
What are you having to drink?

40:33.739 --> 40:36.284
Oh, I will, um... I'll take a beer.

40:36.309 --> 40:37.261
Four shots of tequila. Got it.

40:37.286 --> 40:40.792
- Yes, please. Mm-hmm.
- [laughs]

40:47.138 --> 40:51.147
<i>[distant indistinct talking]</i>

40:52.064 --> 40:53.530
Babe?

40:53.732 --> 40:55.165
<i>[talking continues]</i>

40:55.190 --> 40:57.686
[glass shattering]

40:59.255 --> 41:00.688
Robin?

41:01.934 --> 41:05.967
[Robin screaming, hyperventilating]

41:10.961 --> 41:13.328
No! [crying]

41:13.353 --> 41:15.103
- Robin, look at me.
- [screams]

41:15.128 --> 41:17.517
- [clattering]
- Robin.

41:17.767 --> 41:19.833
[screaming]

41:19.858 --> 41:22.392
- Aah! God!
- [shouting]

41:22.417 --> 41:26.267
- [screaming]
- No, no, no, no, no!

41:26.292 --> 41:28.153
No, no, no. Please.
Robin, open the door.

41:28.178 --> 41:28.951
- [Robin continues screaming]
- Open the door.

41:28.976 --> 41:30.436
Please open the door.

41:30.461 --> 41:32.375
Please open the... Open the...

41:32.400 --> 41:34.856
Open the... Open the door!

41:34.881 --> 41:37.045
Robin, please. Please open the door.

41:37.412 --> 41:38.654
Please!

41:38.679 --> 41:40.108
[Robin screaming]

41:40.133 --> 41:41.764
No, no, no, no, no!

41:41.789 --> 41:45.537
[Robin screaming, crying]

41:46.021 --> 41:47.531
Come on!
