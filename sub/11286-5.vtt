Damn.

00:06.996 --> 00:11.196
Not one dead lawyer
in the whole obituary section.

00:11.263 --> 00:14.596
I mean, how am I supposed
to find a job?

00:14.663 --> 00:17.096
Word to the wise.
Khadijah's in a mood.

00:17.163 --> 00:18.930
[whispering]
That time of the month.

00:18.996 --> 00:20.296
Cramps?

00:20.363 --> 00:24.063
Credit to us, we are doing
Flavor's monthly bills.

00:24.130 --> 00:27.163
I looked it on the books
and I got it figured out.

00:27.230 --> 00:29.930
We can get rid of our debts by
declaring Flavor

00:29.996 --> 00:32.830
a non profit organization.

00:32.896 --> 00:36.263
We gonna have to dress up like
nuns. But it could work.

00:36.330 --> 00:42.096
Khadijah, what you need is a
sharp eye to look those over.

00:42.163 --> 00:46.163
The batteries on the Game Boy
dead again?

00:46.230 --> 00:47.663
Morning, people.

00:47.730 --> 00:51.263
Look at my big fat
commission check.

00:51.330 --> 00:54.496
Mrs. Lisa Marie Presley Jackson
came into the boutique

00:54.563 --> 00:56.463
and bought four neck‐laces,
two bracelets

00:56.530 --> 01:00.970
and a display case.
I did not ask questions.

01:01.036 --> 01:03.003
What you gonna do
with all that money?

01:03.070 --> 01:05.336
I'm gonna use it
the way that God intended.

01:05.403 --> 01:08.003
I'm gonna make my wardrobe
fruitful and multiply.

01:08.070 --> 01:09.336
Enjoy.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.570
Lookie here, Regine.

01:10.636 --> 01:12.870
Maybe I should go shopping
with you, you know.

01:12.936 --> 01:15.436
You never know. You might trip
over some of merchandise.

01:15.503 --> 01:17.236
Break your leg. Have to sue.

01:19.436 --> 01:21.970
Max, please. I'm going
to Bloomi' sale.

01:22.036 --> 01:24.770
My feet won't even
touch the ground.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.436
Well, come on.

01:28.503 --> 01:31.236
There must be something
I can to do for you people.

01:31.303 --> 01:34.036
Oh, good, Max look,
I'm buying a new piece of art

01:34.103 --> 01:36.836

Khadijah, I just got off
the phone with Mary

02:26.443 --> 02:27.810
the owner of the boutique.

02:27.876 --> 02:29.743
I've done something
wonderful for you.

Regine, I don't need
another demo bra.

02:34.110 --> 02:35.743
No.

02:35.810 --> 02:37.910
Mary, want's to start
runnin' ads in magazines.

02:37.976 --> 02:39.710
So, I suggested Flavor.

02:39.776 --> 02:42.776
And she wants you to stop by
later to tell her more.

02:42.843 --> 02:44.043
‐ Really?
‐ Hmm‐mm.

02:44.110 --> 02:45.876
Thank, sure. Flavor really
needs the money.

02:45.943 --> 02:47.543
Hey, it's nothin' alright.

02:47.610 --> 02:50.443
If things work out I'll look
very good for the recommendation

02:50.510 --> 02:53.443
and then both you and Mary
will owe me big.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.610
Hey, ladies. I've installed
a new water heater today.

02:59.676 --> 03:03.250
So if y'all got those womeny
type of things to do

03:03.316 --> 03:06.116
involvin' hot water,
you oughta get to it.

03:08.350 --> 03:12.683
We'll be sure to wash our hair
and birth our babies by noon.

03:12.750 --> 03:15.283
Hey, hey, hey, don't
pick on Overton, alright?

03:15.350 --> 03:19.183
He's just trying to do his,
um, um, what's the word..

03:19.250 --> 03:20.516
...job.

03:25.850 --> 03:28.883
So, Khadijah, call Mary
and set up an appointment, okay?

03:28.950 --> 03:30.916
Or maybe I should
just go right now.

03:30.983 --> 03:33.750
Ah! You might wanna run
a hot comb to your head

03:33.816 --> 03:37.150
and put some clothes on.
Just a thought.

03:40.216 --> 03:43.816
Ah, help me find a hot comb.

03:44.883 --> 03:47.150
Hey, Overton, hey‐hey.

03:47.216 --> 03:48.983
That water heater of yours.

03:49.050 --> 03:51.016
Must come with some
sort of warranty, right?

03:51.083 --> 03:53.816
How about I give it
a legal once over for you?

03:53.883 --> 03:54.850
That ain't no problem.

03:54.916 --> 03:57.250
But I know Kyle needed to..

03:57.316 --> 03:58.450
Khadijah want..

03:58.516 --> 04:00.716
Synclaire?

04:00.783 --> 04:03.790
Damn. I knew I should've rolled
up out the back, come on.

04:07.823 --> 04:09.956
And you can get
a full page layout

04:10.023 --> 04:12.323
for only half of what you're
paying other magazines.

04:12.390 --> 04:13.890
Well, hey, you've
got my attention.

04:13.956 --> 04:18.356
Oh, good you two are talking.
Well, go on, talk, make, sell.

04:20.755 --> 04:22.023
Anyway.

04:22.089 --> 04:25.256
Flavor magazine, really appeals
to a wide variety of people.

04:25.323 --> 04:26.756
People who need clothing.

04:29.523 --> 04:30.923
We appeal to young consumers

04:30.990 --> 04:32.956
who are looking
for new trends in fashion.

04:33.023 --> 04:34.756
That's the market
I'm trying to reach.

04:34.823 --> 04:37.556
Good. And you'd be proud
to see your ad in Flavor.

04:37.623 --> 04:40.590
It's a quality magazine known
for its editorial point of view.

04:40.656 --> 04:43.556
But it's not weighed down
with those complicated stories

04:43.623 --> 04:44.890
that nobody cares about.

04:44.956 --> 04:48.456
The stories are so light
that the ads pop out at ya.

04:48.523 --> 04:49.590
Pop!

04:52.490 --> 04:53.590
Anyway.

04:53.656 --> 04:55.690
The best thing about
a magazine our size

04:55.756 --> 04:58.256
is that we function
as your ad agency as well.

04:58.323 --> 05:00.963
But another benefit
of a magazine this size..

05:01.030 --> 05:02.863
...foldability. Huh?

05:02.930 --> 05:05.963

on your head, while shopping?

Why, girl?
Is my hair messed up?

05:23.996 --> 05:25.130
Regine.

05:25.196 --> 05:27.430
You are ruining my sales pitch.

call it "Underland."

Yup.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.103
You know, my father used to fix
things in the house.

06:46.170 --> 06:48.270
I learned a lot from him.

06:48.336 --> 06:49.570
That's nice.

06:51.470 --> 06:52.403
Let me help.

06:52.470 --> 06:54.270
‐ No.
‐ Come on man, I'm begging you.

06:54.336 --> 06:57.703
Come on, don't be like
that, brother. Come on.

Oh, hey baby, look here.

If Flavor gets the boutique ads

09:14.390 --> 09:17.156
you can make payment on the copy

how we won Mary over?

Hmm‐mm. You should
have heard her.

10:26.096 --> 10:28.363
And Mary said that hooking
her up with Flavor

10:28.430 --> 10:30.396
showed real business savvy.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.363
She even joked about
me having her job some day.

of the same story.

10:50.230 --> 10:52.530

to set her straight.

10:52.596 --> 10:54.363
Oh, let her think
what she wants.

gonna get this account.

of other reasons, alright?

Ah, I love seeing
people in love.

11:57.298 --> 11:58.231
Yes.

11:58.298 --> 11:59.904
Especially you two.

11:59.971 --> 12:00.971
Hmm‐mm.

12:01.038 --> 12:03.504
Your joy is my joy.

12:03.571 --> 12:05.638
There are no words.

12:05.704 --> 12:09.071
Ah, yes. There's one. Bye.

12:11.504 --> 12:13.271
You know that was a brave move

12:13.338 --> 12:17.938
for someone whose real hair
is in a stocking under that.

12:18.004 --> 12:20.738
I'm sorry. But we've got
a lot of work to do

12:20.804 --> 12:22.538
if we're gonna make
the presentation.

12:22.604 --> 12:23.738
Okay‐okay.

12:23.804 --> 12:25.771
Here are my ideas.

12:25.838 --> 12:27.904
Hmm, a bunch
of different people.

12:27.971 --> 12:31.804
Clothing on paper towel
cuts outs. Okay, let's talk.

12:31.871 --> 12:34.071
Now in a creative
give and take, Khadijah.

12:34.138 --> 12:37.104
There are no problems, okay?
Only solutions.

12:37.171 --> 12:38.904
And let's just say
that your solutions

12:38.971 --> 12:40.638
have caused a problem.

12:40.704 --> 12:41.738
What are these?

12:41.804 --> 12:44.171
Ideas for the ad.

12:44.238 --> 12:48.738
It's a desolate Russian
train station in winter.

12:48.804 --> 12:52.604
The image evokes
a continental loneliness.

12:55.671 --> 13:01.778
Loneliness, cold.
Cold, warm. Warm, clothing.

13:01.844 --> 13:05.211
Pretentious, stupid.
Stupid, no‐no. Next.

13:09.278 --> 13:12.811
It's too deep for you.
It's okay.

13:14.878 --> 13:16.678
Regine, these people are naked.

13:16.744 --> 13:18.411
They are not naked.

13:18.478 --> 13:21.111
They are tastefully nude.

13:23.178 --> 13:26.211
We need something simple.
Something straight forward.

13:26.278 --> 13:28.011
Like this.

13:28.078 --> 13:30.711
You show different people
of all shape and sizes.

13:30.778 --> 13:32.411
Short, fat, tall.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.044
And the slogan reads

13:34.111 --> 13:37.378
"Like you, our clothes come
in different shapes and sizes".

13:37.444 --> 13:41.678
Khadijah, these look like
real people. Very unattractive.

13:44.411 --> 13:45.878
‐ Let's get a second opinion.
‐ Fine.

13:47.344 --> 13:51.344
Synclaire, which one
of these two do you like?

13:51.411 --> 13:52.678
Oh, I like this one.

13:52.744 --> 13:56.278
The big guy looks
like my Aunt Selma.

13:57.344 --> 13:59.178
You see, relatability.

13:59.244 --> 14:02.151
Synclaire, how can you pick
her idea over mine?

14:02.218 --> 14:05.684
Ah, oh, okay. Why don't you guys
do something with daisies?

14:05.751 --> 14:07.951
They always work for me.

14:08.018 --> 14:12.951
No, they do not.

14:13.018 --> 14:15.384
Khadijah, I was two blocks away

14:15.451 --> 14:17.684
when a really nice guy
named Marlin

14:17.751 --> 14:20.251
pointed out
I was carrying your purse.

14:20.318 --> 14:22.351
Scooter, thank God you are back.

14:22.418 --> 14:25.651
Now which of these ad campaigns
do you like the best?

14:25.718 --> 14:26.951
The naked one.

14:27.018 --> 14:28.984
You don't even know
what they are selling.

14:29.051 --> 14:30.384
Huh?

14:31.451 --> 14:33.851
Thanks for my bag.

14:33.918 --> 14:36.151
I'm gonna hear about
this later on, aren't I?

14:36.218 --> 14:39.684
‐ Damn, right.
‐ Hmm‐mm, bye, baby.

14:39.751 --> 14:41.784
So, how good could
your idea be, huh?

14:41.851 --> 14:43.818
Your own boyfriend
didn't even like it.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.218
Hey, I liked Khadijah's.

14:45.284 --> 14:47.218
Ah, another arguement
from my side.

14:48.884 --> 14:52.251
What makes you think you could
just come in here and take over?

14:52.318 --> 14:55.051
I'm not tryin'..
Well, you know what, Khadijah?

14:55.118 --> 14:57.984
If it weren't for me,
there'd be nothing to take over.

14:58.051 --> 15:01.324
Now, Mary thought enough of my
ability to put me on the team.

15:01.391 --> 15:03.724
So, you better start
taking me seriously.

15:03.791 --> 15:06.691
Regine, I've been doing this
a lot longer than you.

15:06.758 --> 15:09.858
‐ I know what sells.
‐ Oh, yeah. You know what sells.

15:09.924 --> 15:12.924
Your magazine is so broke,
it's about to become a <i>pamphlet.</i>

15:14.191 --> 15:17.858
I think now would be
a good time to pack up

15:17.924 --> 15:20.424
your low executive playset
and skip your ass on

15:20.491 --> 15:22.424
back to the botique.

15:28.324 --> 15:30.258
I'll see you
at the pitch meeting.

15:30.324 --> 15:32.258
Oh, Khadijah, remember.

15:32.324 --> 15:34.458
You're a passenger
on this bus..

15:34.524 --> 15:36.458
...don't try to drive.

15:38.691 --> 15:39.958
Smooches.

15:42.991 --> 15:47.091
Maybe this will be a good time
for a soothing Gregorian chant.

15:47.158 --> 15:50.058
[humming]

16:00.964 --> 16:01.964
[whispering]
Lights on.

16:03.964 --> 16:04.931
Hey, Obie.

16:06.898 --> 16:10.698
Max, I thought
we had a understanding.

16:10.764 --> 16:15.931
See, this is overlayin',
for Overton.

16:15.998 --> 16:17.864
Yes, I'm sorry.

16:17.931 --> 16:22.131
But I just came down here to
prepare a surprise for you.

16:22.198 --> 16:25.331
Hm, that's nice.
Should I close my eyes?

16:27.798 --> 16:30.064
You are looking right at it.

16:33.498 --> 16:37.931
I realise the basement brings
out the romantic in anyone.

16:37.998 --> 16:40.064
And you're a very
lovely woman..

16:40.131 --> 16:41.664
No, you nut, please!

16:41.731 --> 16:44.498
I installed the water heater.

16:44.564 --> 16:46.498
You did what?

16:46.564 --> 16:49.231
Okay, you're welcome.
You can thank me with food.

16:57.098 --> 16:58.698
[sniffing]

17:00.071 --> 17:01.471
Up to spanks.

17:03.504 --> 17:06.438
All we gotta do now is install
the steam release valve

17:06.503 --> 17:09.137
and adjust the thermostat,
yeah, we in business.

17:09.204 --> 17:12.971
Don't worry about it, I already
adjusted the thermostat.

17:13.038 --> 17:15.171
What's the steam release valve?

17:19.070 --> 17:21.003
It's supposed to
do that, right?

17:23.304 --> 17:25.971
‐ Hell no.
‐ 'What are we gonna do now?'

17:26.038 --> 17:27.338
Run!

17:34.171 --> 17:36.538
And as you can see
the photograph would be

17:36.604 --> 17:38.704
very artistic
and <i>Avant‐garde.</i>

17:40.271 --> 17:42.304
What is it?

17:42.371 --> 17:44.304
Naked people behind a bush.

17:45.571 --> 17:47.804
Well, that would be great
if we were selling

17:47.871 --> 17:50.138
hedge clippers
or Calamine Lotion.

17:50.204 --> 17:51.471
[coughing]

17:53.904 --> 17:55.838
Do you have any other ideas?

17:58.238 --> 18:00.178
Well, the other concepts
aren't as trendy

18:00.244 --> 18:02.811
but that maybe
for the best.

18:02.878 --> 18:04.978
The idea for this
is a collage

18:05.044 --> 18:07.278
of different people of
all shapes and sizes.

18:07.344 --> 18:08.844
And the slogan reads

18:08.911 --> 18:12.344
"Like you, our clothes come
in all shapes and sizes."

18:12.411 --> 18:15.511
I don't know about this.
That's a snoozer.

18:18.044 --> 18:19.978
Maybe we should
just forget this.

18:20.044 --> 18:23.078
You know, I thought you two had
such a good chemistry going

18:23.144 --> 18:26.644
but based on these ideas,
I can see I was wrong.

18:28.844 --> 18:30.778
Chemistry?
We are a chemistry set.

18:30.844 --> 18:32.778
You've never seen two people
work together

18:32.844 --> 18:35.878
like Regine and myself,
side by side.

18:35.944 --> 18:37.478
Shoulder to shoulder.

18:37.544 --> 18:39.478
Well, we live together,
we eat together.

18:39.544 --> 18:43.178
We both support a homeless woman
who comes from across the street

18:43.244 --> 18:45.178
and lives in our kitchen.

18:46.878 --> 18:47.911
We're close.

18:47.978 --> 18:50.744
I'm sure if you just gave us
a little more time

18:50.811 --> 18:53.278
we could come up with
something you'll love.

18:53.344 --> 18:55.478
Okay, I'll give you a week.

18:56.744 --> 18:57.878
[sighing]

18:59.478 --> 19:02.184
That was a good save, Khadijah.

19:02.251 --> 19:04.818
Unfortunately, I don't
wanna work with you.

19:04.884 --> 19:07.484
Duh, I don't wanna work
with you either.

19:07.551 --> 19:09.818
But I need this account.

19:09.884 --> 19:13.418
Did it ever occur to you that
this is important to me too.

19:13.484 --> 19:16.884
No, I was too busy trying
to save my little pamphlet.

19:19.518 --> 19:22.618
You know, Khadijah, it's like
you don't take me seriously.

19:22.684 --> 19:24.784
You think
I'm this beautiful diva

19:24.851 --> 19:27.318
with a closet full of great hair

19:27.384 --> 19:29.884
and‐and that I can just throw
together a fabulous outfit

19:29.951 --> 19:31.084
from practically nothing.

19:31.151 --> 19:33.084
Well, there's more
to me than that.

19:34.818 --> 19:37.018
Regine, I think
you're an intelligent woman

19:37.084 --> 19:39.318
who can do anything
she sets her mind to.

19:39.384 --> 19:41.318
You do?

19:41.384 --> 19:43.951
Yeah, the problem is
you don't know it.

19:44.018 --> 19:45.418
‐ I don't?
‐ No.

19:45.484 --> 19:48.218
So you come up in here like
you own a joint

19:48.284 --> 19:50.318
just because you got
somethin' to prove.

19:50.384 --> 19:51.584
It's not necessary.

19:52.951 --> 19:57.751
[chuckles]
So, I got it goin' on?

19:57.818 --> 20:00.991
I just don't know
I got it goin' on?

20:01.058 --> 20:05.524
Alright. Who cares as long
as I got it goin' on.

20:05.591 --> 20:08.024
It's a beautiful thing.

20:08.091 --> 20:12.724
[sighing]
Khadijah, it's not
really a pamphlet.

20:14.624 --> 20:16.324
Thanks.

20:16.391 --> 20:18.324
Now, look.
We gotta get this account.

20:18.391 --> 20:20.358
Right, so, um,
I don't know.

20:20.424 --> 20:23.591
I guess, we gotta come up
with a totally new idea.

20:23.658 --> 20:25.591
Yeah, something completely new.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.591
Okay...let's think.

20:38.591 --> 20:40.191
I got it!

20:41.424 --> 20:44.691
A picture of the boutique
in a graveyard

20:44.758 --> 20:48.124
and the slogan is,
"Shop or die."

20:48.191 --> 20:49.158
[cackling]

20:49.224 --> 20:51.158
No, no, no.
Atleast, atleast..

20:51.224 --> 20:55.258
...make it a maternity ward
and have it say, "Born to shop."

20:55.324 --> 20:58.258
No, no, no. We'll put 'em
together, "Born, shop, die."

20:58.324 --> 21:00.264
'Cause that's
how life goes.

21:00.331 --> 21:02.564
‐ Hm, well, if you're lucky.
‐ What do you mean?

21:02.631 --> 21:05.698
Well, you're born, you die
and if you're lucky

21:05.764 --> 21:07.698
you do some good shopping
in between.

21:07.764 --> 21:09.098
That's it!

21:09.164 --> 21:11.498
(both)
"You're born, you die
and if you're lucky

21:11.564 --> 21:13.798
you get to do some
good shopping in between."

21:13.864 --> 21:15.498
I'm going to catch Mary.

21:15.564 --> 21:17.031
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

21:17.098 --> 21:19.298
We gotta make a formal
presentation right?

21:19.364 --> 21:21.298
With a overhead projector
and all.

21:21.364 --> 21:23.331
Do you want to tell
Mary this idea

21:23.398 --> 21:25.164
or spend another
six days with me?

21:25.231 --> 21:26.498
Let's go.

21:29.198 --> 21:30.531
It's dope.

21:30.598 --> 21:32.898
(both)
"You're born, you die
and if you're lucky

21:32.964 --> 21:35.598
you get to do some
good shopping in between."

21:43.098 --> 21:44.631
Lights on.

21:44.698 --> 21:50.131
[suspires]
Oh! Obie, it's everything
I dreamt about and more.

21:50.198 --> 21:52.664
How come nobody else
was allowed down here?

21:52.731 --> 21:57.798
Well, yesterday I realized
what a romantic spot this was.

21:57.864 --> 22:01.088
And, now for the best part..

22:01.154 --> 22:02.721
...lights off.

22:04.621 --> 22:06.821
(Max)
'Hey, Obie.'

22:06.888 --> 22:09.888
(Obie)
Max? Lights on.

22:09.954 --> 22:12.188
I said, "Lights on!"

22:12.254 --> 22:15.021
That damn light switch, eh!

22:15.088 --> 22:16.421
(Max)
'Here it is!'

22:16.488 --> 22:18.421
[explosion]

22:26.454 --> 22:28.454
[theme music]
