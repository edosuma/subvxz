WEBVTT

00:02.251 --> 00:04.986
Since mom is out of town,
wizard class is cancelled.

00:05.020 --> 00:07.054
Yes!

00:07.089 --> 00:10.390
What does Mom being away have to
do with class being cancelled?

00:10.425 --> 00:13.246
I said Mom's away.
We can have some fun.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.493
- Yes!
- Yeah!

00:15.528 --> 00:19.539
Hey, what's really fun is
when you give me my allowance.

00:19.574 --> 00:22.935
First we're gonna play something
I like to call Spell Roulette.

00:22.969 --> 00:25.428
Here's the book of spells.

00:25.462 --> 00:27.766
Each of you randomly points to one,

00:27.800 --> 00:31.004
recites it and then
we see what happens.

00:32.738 --> 00:34.503
- I'll go first.
- OK.

00:40.011 --> 00:41.679
Defleppard, Animalus.

00:48.309 --> 00:50.175
Now, this is Undo Dust.

00:50.209 --> 00:53.743
It undoes a spell when a wizard
forgets how to reverse it.

00:53.777 --> 00:56.914
What kind of wizard, Alex,
would be so ill-prepared, Alex,

00:56.948 --> 00:59.550
where they would forget
a reverse spell, Alex?

01:01.987 --> 01:05.420
What kind of jerk, Justin...
I'm good with just saying that.

01:06.756 --> 01:08.224
All right.

01:12.761 --> 01:14.795
OK, Alex, you're up.

01:15.564 --> 01:17.866
There you go.

01:22.571 --> 01:24.605
No, you can't just change it.

01:24.639 --> 01:27.773
- Yeah, no, it's not...
- She doesn't do the rules.

01:27.807 --> 01:29.975
Ooh! I like this one.
Rain on, chain on.

01:35.513 --> 01:38.381
Nice. And with that,
I'll be out spending my allowance.

01:38.415 --> 01:40.750
Sorry, Alex. I don't
have any cash on me.

01:40.784 --> 01:43.219
Guess you should've thought
your little plan through

01:43.253 --> 01:44.786
a little more carefully.

01:44.821 --> 01:46.954
Oh, I did.

01:46.989 --> 01:50.458
What? I'm part of your plan?
No! That's...

01:50.492 --> 01:53.827
Um, Dad, you owe Justin $25.

01:53.862 --> 01:57.398
Huh? Wait. Alex,
come back here! Come on!

01:59.000 --> 02:01.065
* Well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

02:01.333 --> 02:02.967
* That the end will no
doubt justify the means *

02:03.601 --> 02:05.168
* You can fix any problem
with the slightest of ease *

02:05.203 --> 02:06.801
* Yes, please *

02:06.835 --> 02:08.637
* But you might find out
it'll go to your head *

02:09.238 --> 02:10.270
* When you write a report
on a book you never read *

02:11.173 --> 02:12.774
* With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

02:12.808 --> 02:14.608
* That's what I said *

02:14.643 --> 02:17.711
* Everything is not what it seems *

02:17.746 --> 02:21.582
* You can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *

02:21.616 --> 02:25.153
* You might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

02:25.188 --> 02:30.022
* Because everything
is not what it seems *

02:30.057 --> 02:33.158
* Everything is not what it seems *

02:33.193 --> 02:36.962
* When you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

02:36.996 --> 02:40.797
* Be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

02:40.832 --> 02:44.667
* Because everything is not *

02:44.701 --> 02:46.236
* What it seems *

02:46.237 --> 02:52.237

02:53.375 --> 02:55.776
Wow. Alex, I really like
what you've done here.

02:55.810 --> 02:58.846
It's a very dramatic blend
of color and circles.

02:58.880 --> 03:01.415
Really? 'Cause I was
just painting this.

03:04.451 --> 03:09.054
Nice. Hey, everybody,
take a look at Alex's piece.

03:09.089 --> 03:12.591
Some of us are over-thinking
our projects a little too much

03:12.625 --> 03:17.027
and we could all follow Alex's
lead and be more spontaneous.

03:17.062 --> 03:19.796
I'll show you spontaneous.

03:21.432 --> 03:24.967
Let's skip this class and do
something more interesting,

03:25.001 --> 03:27.901
like watching the football
team learn how to read.

03:27.935 --> 03:31.036
OK, good work, everybody.

03:32.772 --> 03:35.907
And, T.J., how about for
your next assignment

03:35.942 --> 03:39.911
you draw yourself a detention
slip and I'll sign it?

03:43.981 --> 03:47.383
And that is why you are
my favorite teacher.

03:47.418 --> 03:49.785
And do you know why you're
my favorite student?

03:49.820 --> 03:52.888
Because you'll hang back
after class and clean up.

03:54.590 --> 03:57.190
Oh, I see what you did there.

03:57.225 --> 03:58.858
I don't like it, but I respect it.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:07.400 --> 04:11.135
Clean it up. Wash it,
scrub it down, oh, no.

04:14.037 --> 04:20.391
What did you just do?

04:20.425 --> 04:24.593
that was fast.
That was almost instantaneous.

04:26.748 --> 04:32.097
That's because I clean
things competitively?

04:33.662 --> 04:36.779
And I am a champion
competitive cleaner.

04:36.814 --> 04:39.768
It was a really good class today.
You were great. OK, bye!

04:43.093 --> 04:45.086
Justin, I need you to
sign something for me.

04:48.939 --> 04:51.795
"Dear Coach Gunderson.
Please excuse Max from P.E."

04:51.829 --> 04:54.455
"He has mono-orangosis."

04:54.489 --> 04:57.010
I've never even heard
of mono-orangosis.

04:57.045 --> 05:00.629
Yeah, well, that's because it's
a very rare color blindness.

05:02.161 --> 05:05.516
- Oh, really?
- I can't see anything orange.

05:05.550 --> 05:08.105
I can't taste orange.
I can't even hear orange.

05:08.139 --> 05:12.058
In fact, I didn't hear
half of what I just said.

05:12.092 --> 05:14.580
Sure you don't wanna go with
something more realistic,

05:14.614 --> 05:16.706
like I'm-a-dumbadosis?

05:16.740 --> 05:18.832
- Oh.
- Yeah.

05:18.867 --> 05:22.222
That's a really nice way to
talk to somebody with a disease!

05:24.316 --> 05:26.475
You have a disease?

05:26.505 --> 05:28.931
Why, yes, I do.

05:30.329 --> 05:33.914
- It's mono-orangosis.
- Oh, you poor baby.

05:33.948 --> 05:36.870
- You know, I've heard of that.
- You have?

05:38.401 --> 05:41.322
Well, that is kind of
impossible, but great.

05:48.132 --> 05:50.751
You're not gonna believe what
I set up for the sleep-over.

05:50.785 --> 05:53.807
We're gonna make our own purses!

05:53.841 --> 05:57.893
We can sew on the buttons,
appliquÃƒÂ©s, ribbons.

05:57.927 --> 06:00.021
Oh, Harper, this is
gonna be so much fun.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.933
Oh, I just love our
slumber parties.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.025
Oh, me, too.

06:11.381 --> 06:14.403
Wouldn't that be awesome if that
was the pizza we forgot to order?

06:20.383 --> 06:21.879
You're a wizard.

06:23.538 --> 06:26.197
I've been thinking about how you
cleaned up in class so fast,

06:26.228 --> 06:28.587
and there's only one explanation.

06:28.621 --> 06:30.746
You are a wizard.

06:32.111 --> 06:34.565
No, I'm not. Harper, am I a wizard?

06:34.600 --> 06:36.825
Alex? A wizard?

06:39.820 --> 06:42.542
Please. It's not like she's
got a magic flying carpet

06:42.576 --> 06:44.868
or can duplicate herself
or knows a spell to make

06:45.098 --> 06:48.020
a klutzy person not klutzy when
they work at their sandwich shop.

06:48.054 --> 06:50.113
If she was a wizard,
she could do those things,

06:50.147 --> 06:54.265
but she doesn't, so she isn't.

06:57.555 --> 07:01.239
Alex, please. I know that T.J.
from class is a wizard, too.

07:01.274 --> 07:04.496
- T.J.'s a wizard?
- Yes, T.J.'s a wizard.

07:04.530 --> 07:07.518
What other secrets
haven't you told me?

07:08.782 --> 07:10.207
Um, I'm not gonna make a purse.

07:12.368 --> 07:14.989
Alex, I need your help.

07:17.183 --> 07:18.975
OK, I'm not saying I'm a wizard,

07:19.010 --> 07:20.902
but what kind of help
are we talking about?

07:20.936 --> 07:22.961
T.J. and I dated over the summer.

07:22.996 --> 07:25.188
Ewww!

07:25.222 --> 07:27.449
It didn't end well

07:27.483 --> 07:30.272
and he turned me
into the worst thing

07:30.306 --> 07:32.331
that he could think of.

07:33.128 --> 07:34.457
A 40-year-old woman.

07:34.492 --> 07:36.384
No!

07:38.939 --> 07:42.495
I was a 16-year-old girl.

07:42.529 --> 07:43.821
Prove it.

07:43.855 --> 07:45.814
I can text 50 words a
minute without looking.

07:45.848 --> 07:47.873
I eat strawberry lip
gloss like it's candy.

07:48.108 --> 07:50.434
If I could dress like I was
going to the beach all the time,

07:50.468 --> 07:51.497
I would.

07:53.124 --> 07:56.179
Sounds more like a 14-year-old girl,
if you ask me.

07:56.214 --> 07:59.469
Alex, if you could
turn me back to 16,

07:59.504 --> 08:01.329
I would be your best friend.

08:01.363 --> 08:05.978
Uh-huh! Sorry, woman.
That position is filled.

08:08.635 --> 08:10.398
- I'm just saying.
- OK. Shh.

08:10.433 --> 08:12.458
Um, OK.

08:14.086 --> 08:17.558
There's only one way to find out
if you were a 16-year-old girl.

08:17.592 --> 08:21.624
I'm not saying I'm a wizard,
but I'll go get the Undo Dust,

08:21.658 --> 08:25.627
which undoes spells,
if there were such thing as spells.

08:29.231 --> 08:32.633
- And he's out of the chute.
- Oh, oh. Ah-ha-ha!

08:32.667 --> 08:36.269
What'd I tell you? Looks like
we got another Cat Man Don't!

08:36.304 --> 08:38.938
Ride him! You gotta
just get in there.

08:38.972 --> 08:41.840
Hold onto him. Wow!

08:41.874 --> 08:44.909
Ya-hoo! Come on.

08:45.944 --> 08:47.811
All right, Miss Majorhealey.

08:47.845 --> 08:51.014
When we sprinkle the dust,
we'll find out if you really are 16.

08:57.187 --> 08:58.720
Dang! She's cute.

09:01.323 --> 09:03.558
Check me out!

09:04.793 --> 09:06.927
I'm back! I'm back!

09:08.863 --> 09:10.396
Whoo-hoo!

09:12.266 --> 09:15.467
Do you have any "shut
your piehole" dust?

09:15.502 --> 09:17.869
Well, she's happy.

09:17.903 --> 09:21.271
Hey, you have to promise not to
tell anybody I'm a wizard, OK?

09:21.306 --> 09:25.742
Oh, yeah, sure. Whatever.
'Cause you did it!

09:25.776 --> 09:27.377
Look at me! I'm back!

09:29.446 --> 09:40.153
I think I know why T.
J. broke up with her.

09:40.188 --> 09:44.257
So, T.J., heard a rumor about
you and Miss Majorhealey.

09:44.292 --> 09:47.360
Well, I'm not a fan,
but it's no rumor.

09:47.394 --> 09:49.563
I know you turned her
into a 40-year-old woman,

09:49.564 --> 09:51.165
so I turned her back.

09:51.300 --> 09:54.769
You what?! That is so not cool, Alex.
Not cool at all.

09:54.803 --> 09:57.772
And what happened between me and
Jenny is none of your business.

09:57.806 --> 10:01.541
Besides, have you heard her squeak?

10:03.277 --> 10:04.911
OK, she's a bit of a squeaker,

10:04.945 --> 10:07.080
but what you did to
her is still wrong.

10:07.114 --> 10:09.816
It's wizards like you who are
almost gonna get us exposed.

10:09.850 --> 10:13.852
Alex, you've got a mouth on you.

10:13.886 --> 10:16.087
I was wondering if you
would help spread word

10:16.121 --> 10:17.854
that art class is cancelled.

10:17.889 --> 10:19.322
What? Why?

10:19.356 --> 10:23.291
Miss Majorhealey texted
in her resignation.

10:25.228 --> 10:28.864
Which is strange, 'cause I
didn't know my phone got texts.

10:32.402 --> 10:34.503
That's it? You're just
gonna cancel art class

10:34.538 --> 10:36.671
because you don't have
a teacher to teach it?

10:36.705 --> 10:39.540
That's kind of how schools work.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.540
But I love art.

10:42.574 --> 10:44.941
Maybe it's time to start
loving some other classes,

10:44.976 --> 10:48.376
like math or English or science.

10:48.410 --> 10:50.244
Nobody likes a one-trick pony.

10:55.589 --> 10:57.456
Hey, Alex! Hey, Harper!

10:57.490 --> 11:01.025
Miss Major... Miss Majorhealey!
Where have you been?

11:01.060 --> 11:03.060
Did you know that they
cancelled art class?

11:03.228 --> 11:06.429
I know. I quit so I could
make up for the time I lost

11:06.464 --> 11:08.831
when I wasn't 15 and part of 16.

11:08.865 --> 11:10.899
Ooh! And call me Jenny.

11:12.302 --> 11:14.469
No, I don't wanna call you Jenny.

11:14.504 --> 11:16.139
I wanna call you Miss Majorhealey

11:16.173 --> 11:17.774
and I want you to
be my art teacher,

11:18.309 --> 11:20.746
so I can keep the one class I
love and stay off the streets.

11:22.048 --> 11:24.350
If there's one thing I
learned from being 40,

11:24.384 --> 11:28.053
it's that you don't need
a class to be artistic.

11:28.087 --> 11:30.121
And you need to stretch more.

11:31.590 --> 11:35.092
What about T.J.? Don't you wanna
rub it in his face you're back?

11:35.127 --> 11:36.794
Nothing ever feels finished to me

11:36.828 --> 11:38.662
unless I rub it in someone's face.

11:38.696 --> 11:41.097
And the other thing I
learned from when I was 40

11:41.132 --> 11:44.000
is that rubbing it in someone's
face doesn't get you anywhere.

11:44.034 --> 11:47.270
Really? Then I definitely
don't wanna get older. Uh-uh.

11:48.705 --> 11:49.905
Oh, that reminds me.

11:49.939 --> 11:52.006
I have to go sell a car.

11:52.041 --> 11:55.342
Because I am no longer
a licensed driver.

12:01.181 --> 12:03.682
Hello. Thank you for coming
to Waverly Sub Station.

12:03.716 --> 12:05.383
My name is Justin.
Can I interest you

12:05.418 --> 12:07.251
in a half-sandwich
pickle spear combo?

12:10.689 --> 12:13.590
You're Misty May-Treanor.

12:13.624 --> 12:15.558
Oh, my gosh! Oh,
my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

12:16.493 --> 12:19.995
Holy moly!

12:20.030 --> 12:22.597
Uh...

12:22.631 --> 12:24.765
Hey. What's up, Misty?

12:26.833 --> 12:28.667
Hi, trying-to-be-cool-guy.

12:30.403 --> 12:32.270
I'm looking for Max Russo.

12:32.304 --> 12:36.440
I'm sorry if he took your gold
medal but he likes shiny things.

12:37.943 --> 12:41.111
My niece, Chelsa,
says he's fighting mono-orangosis.

12:41.145 --> 12:44.646
I think I saw it on a telethon,
so I stopped by to cheer him up.

12:46.615 --> 12:50.485
Max. There's someone here you
need to explain something to.

12:51.453 --> 12:53.320
Hi, Max. I'm Misty May-Treanor.

12:53.354 --> 12:56.088
Oh, yeah? Prove it.

12:57.724 --> 13:00.625
How many fingers am I holding up?

13:00.660 --> 13:03.294
- Uh, two.
- Oh, my gosh.

13:03.328 --> 13:05.062
You are Misty May-Treanor!

13:07.965 --> 13:10.066
- Whoa!
- I heard about your disease.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.801
I thought you would wanna take
your mind off it and hang out.

13:12.835 --> 13:15.303
OK. Come on.

13:15.338 --> 13:19.374
Oh, Justin, you can cover
my shift for me, right?

13:19.408 --> 13:21.675
No.

13:21.710 --> 13:23.344
Oh, I think you can.

13:23.378 --> 13:25.413
You got it, Misty.

13:26.915 --> 13:31.317
Mr. Laritate. Mr. Laritate,
you can't cancel art class.

13:31.352 --> 13:34.587
Life isn't just about facts and figures,
it's about expression.

13:34.621 --> 13:37.957
If kids don't express themselves
in a controlled environment,

13:37.991 --> 13:40.827
they'll just end up on the streets.

13:43.230 --> 13:44.797
Russo, I'm impressed.

13:44.832 --> 13:46.265
Your passion for something

13:46.300 --> 13:48.000
besides getting out of schoolwork

13:48.034 --> 13:50.936
warms this old cowboy's heart.

13:50.970 --> 13:54.572
- It does?
- Like a campfire.

13:54.606 --> 13:56.507
I should be able to
pull a few strings

13:56.708 --> 13:59.343
and get things up and running
again at the old art corral.

14:00.878 --> 14:03.212
Thank you, Mr. Laritate.
It really means a lot to me.

14:03.247 --> 14:05.481
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing.

14:07.017 --> 14:10.186
Could you give this basket
to your ailing brother, Max?

14:10.220 --> 14:13.655
It has some of hisavorite
knick-knacks and do-dads.

14:16.625 --> 14:20.194
Yes, sir, Mr. Laritate.
I'll give Max the basket.

14:30.437 --> 14:31.871
He only said the basket.

14:35.109 --> 14:37.843
Excuse me. Do you know where
I could find Max Russo?

14:37.878 --> 14:39.845
Look, whatever he broke,

14:39.879 --> 14:42.014
you should have gotten
the extended warranty.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.082
No, no, no.

14:45.918 --> 14:50.220
- I'm Dwayne Johnson.
- Oh, you're Dwayne Johnson.

14:50.254 --> 14:52.055
Well, the water
founin's over there,

14:52.089 --> 14:53.956
but I don't think
you should fix it.

14:53.990 --> 14:56.124
It's funny when people
get squirted in the eye.

14:56.159 --> 14:58.726
No, I'm sure it's funny, but...

14:58.760 --> 15:01.762
I'm Dwayne Johnson, the actor.

15:01.796 --> 15:03.997
Great. I'm Alex Russo,

15:04.031 --> 15:06.732
and my hobby is I like to
poke things with a stick.

15:06.766 --> 15:10.235
But I haven't figured out how
to make money with that yet,

15:10.269 --> 15:11.903
so I'm in school.

15:12.138 --> 15:16.408
Actors need a second job until
they make it. You're a plumber.

15:16.442 --> 15:19.543
Actually, I'm not a plumber.
I've been in quite a few movies.

15:19.577 --> 15:21.644
Acting is my first and only job.

15:21.679 --> 15:24.480
All right. Hope that
works out for you, then.

15:26.950 --> 15:30.718
Wow. Well, let me know if you
ever get into personal training.

15:30.753 --> 15:32.787
You're in shape. What do you bench?

15:34.189 --> 15:36.324
- 450, but who's counting?
- Right.

15:37.459 --> 15:39.894
I could design a
cardio program for you.

15:39.895 --> 15:42.830
- Oh, my gosh. That'd be great.
- You em like a nice girl.

15:42.865 --> 15:44.932
I always dat first.

15:46.068 --> 15:48.002
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

15:48.036 --> 15:50.337
Let me go look at the fountain,
see if I can fix it.

15:54.101 --> 15:58.330
It's terrible. I think I read
about that on the internets.

16:01.400 --> 16:02.899
- I gotta go cheer him up.
- Right.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.302
- I'll get back to you.
- OK.

16:05.336 --> 16:07.437
Hey, everybody,
look! It's the famous actor,

16:07.471 --> 16:09.305
Dwayne Johnson,
fixing our fountain!

16:17.115 --> 16:20.150
OK, here's your turkey on
wheat with a side of coleslaw

16:20.184 --> 16:21.518
and red and blue chips...

16:21.553 --> 16:23.153
Dad! Misty May-Treanor is here

16:23.188 --> 16:25.122
because Max pretended
to have a fake disease

16:25.156 --> 16:27.357
that doesn't let him taste,
hear or see orange.

16:27.392 --> 16:30.227
And people are giving him gift baskets,
and it's all wrong.

16:32.296 --> 16:34.661
- Did you say Misty May-Treanor?
- Yes.

16:38.332 --> 16:39.500
Whoa!

16:41.469 --> 16:42.936
That was a spike.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.807
Oh! Misty May-Treanor!

16:48.842 --> 16:51.009
Is it? Misty May-Treanor!

16:52.478 --> 16:54.579
Wow! You're... you.

16:54.613 --> 16:57.014
Yes, I am.

16:58.250 --> 17:00.917
Mr. Russo, I can't even
imagine how rough it is

17:00.951 --> 17:03.285
for you to deal with what
Max is going through.

17:06.289 --> 17:09.824
Misty, there's something we all
need to tell you and I'm just...

17:09.858 --> 17:14.662
Yes, yes. It's very, very trying

17:14.695 --> 17:17.329
to have a son with this condition.

17:17.364 --> 17:20.265
Especially with the
furniture in this house.

17:20.299 --> 17:23.666
What? Lies!

17:23.702 --> 17:27.471
What makes it worse is when the
whole family's not supportive.

17:29.073 --> 17:33.041
We... We're working on him.
He's in denial, so...

17:33.075 --> 17:37.077
Dad, we're making salad.
Do you want a bowl?

17:38.612 --> 17:41.881
Salad. Of course I would, son.

17:41.915 --> 17:44.583
Justin, you mind covering
my shift down at the shop?

17:44.617 --> 17:46.985
I think we're gonna be awhile.

17:47.019 --> 17:49.353
No! I'm already working a double,
and this is...

17:49.387 --> 17:51.788
You wanna get the door, son?

17:54.691 --> 17:56.858
Aunt Misty, I just
searched the internet

17:56.892 --> 17:58.993
and there's no such
thing as mono-orangosis!

17:59.027 --> 18:02.296
The truth!

18:02.330 --> 18:06.132
You know, since the Olympics,
this has been happening a lot.

18:06.167 --> 18:09.535
- You people are sick.
- No, Misty, wait!

18:09.569 --> 18:11.169
- You have to sign my...
- Let it go.

18:11.204 --> 18:12.437
- ..sign my son!
- No!

18:12.604 --> 18:13.871
- Please! Misty!
- Not your son.

18:14.239 --> 18:16.107
- Get out ay! Misty!
- Come on. No!

18:21.812 --> 18:24.580
So, here we are, T.J.

18:24.614 --> 18:27.749
I got Jenny back and now
I got the art class back.

18:27.783 --> 18:31.984
So I guess you can say
I'm kind of on a roll.

18:34.454 --> 18:37.288
It gives me great
pleasure to announce

18:37.322 --> 18:40.325
that I am going to be
teaching art class.

18:41.827 --> 18:43.527
Wait.

18:45.196 --> 18:47.029
You're teaching the class?

18:47.064 --> 18:50.799
Yes, thanks to your
inspiring speech.

18:50.833 --> 18:53.902
Oh. Now I'm on the roll.

18:55.571 --> 18:58.504
All right, let's kick things
off with a little painting.

18:58.538 --> 19:01.907
Today we're gointo
be interpreting me.

19:01.941 --> 19:05.243
Wearing my cowboy suit.

19:10.249 --> 19:12.483
All right. Please grab your brushes

19:12.517 --> 19:13.918
and pay attention to detail.

19:13.952 --> 19:15.786
Take your time and don't rush,

19:15.820 --> 19:20.190
as art is all about pre-planning

19:20.224 --> 19:22.291
and being exact.

19:23.860 --> 19:25.394
But that's not art.

19:25.528 --> 19:29.730
It is if Mr. Laritate,
our art teacher, says it is.

19:31.266 --> 19:33.166
Brushes up!

19:33.200 --> 19:35.534
And... begin.

19:37.470 --> 19:39.437
Mr. Laritate, no offense,

19:39.471 --> 19:42.672
but I... I don't think
art is about being exact.

19:42.706 --> 19:45.374
It's about everyone's
individual interpretation.

19:45.408 --> 19:48.409
Not here. I'm the
sheriff of this class

19:48.444 --> 19:50.851
and I wanna see
everyone's replication

19:50.885 --> 19:54.310
of the billowy
wooliness of my chaps.

20:02.986 --> 20:06.987
Mr. Laritate, as much as I
would love painting your chaps,

20:07.022 --> 20:10.056
I think art class should
be a little more creative.

20:10.091 --> 20:13.125
A class where we can
truly express ourselves

20:13.160 --> 20:15.027
in a way words can't.

20:15.061 --> 20:17.229
If you think you have a
better interpretation

20:17.330 --> 20:20.631
of what art class should be,
why don't you share it with us?

20:22.066 --> 20:24.934
Right. Everyone grab your brushes

20:24.969 --> 20:26.502
and paint whatever you want.

20:26.537 --> 20:30.005
Be creative, spontaneous,
passionate.

20:30.039 --> 20:32.642
I'll show you passion.

20:34.278 --> 20:36.312
Is that all you got?

20:51.093 --> 20:52.193
Ha-ha!

20:55.631 --> 20:58.233
Whoa, Nelly!

21:04.409 --> 21:06.309
Alex, look what you did.

21:06.344 --> 21:08.878
I'm so sorry, Mr. Laritate.

21:10.013 --> 21:11.847
Miss Russo, I have never seen,

21:11.881 --> 21:14.149
in all my years of teaching,
a student who...

21:14.184 --> 21:16.619
I know, I know.
A student so disobedient,

21:16.653 --> 21:18.754
who cares about no one
but herself, blah, blah.

21:18.789 --> 21:21.090
I heard this last period.

21:21.124 --> 21:23.157
No. I'm talking about a student

21:23.192 --> 21:25.592
who showed so much passion
for what she believed in,

21:25.627 --> 21:27.761
who probably surprised herself

21:27.796 --> 21:29.964
but didn't surprise me at all.

21:29.998 --> 21:32.032
Just look at what you inspired.

21:35.770 --> 21:37.904
To reward you for your
dedication to this class,

21:37.938 --> 21:40.540
I'm going to go out and
find you a real art teacher.

21:40.574 --> 21:43.810
- You can be teacher's deputy.
- Great.

21:45.979 --> 21:49.282
My first job as deputy is this.

21:49.316 --> 21:51.250
T.J., why don't you
take out your sketch pad

21:51.285 --> 21:54.554
and draw yourself a detention slip?

21:54.588 --> 21:57.523
I'll show you a detention slip.

21:57.557 --> 21:59.925
Thank you. That's
exactly what I wanted.

22:00.894 --> 22:02.093
That backfired.

22:05.925 --> 22:10.128
OK, here's the melt you
ordered with no cheese.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.096
So, technically,
it's just warm tuna.

22:12.131 --> 22:14.831
Mom, Dwayne Johnson
is upstairs with Max

22:14.866 --> 22:18.267
because he pretended to
have mono-orangosis again.

22:18.302 --> 22:21.369
- Did you say Dwayne Johnson?
- Dwayne Johnson.

22:21.404 --> 22:23.071
Oh, my God!

22:25.508 --> 22:27.543
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

22:33.315 --> 22:34.981
All these muscles and I'm powerless

22:35.016 --> 22:37.817
against your mono-orangosis.

22:38.752 --> 22:40.519
Dwayne Johnson!

22:40.553 --> 22:43.288
Oh, my gosh! You are you!

22:43.322 --> 22:46.857
Yes, I am. Mrs. Russo,
I'm so sorry to hear about Max.

22:46.891 --> 22:50.225
- It's gotta be so rough on you.
- Oh, it's so tough.

22:51.494 --> 22:53.928
I could just faint.

22:53.963 --> 22:55.563
- Catch me, Dwayne.
- Sure. Yeah.

23:03.571 --> 23:05.505
Oh!

23:05.540 --> 23:09.242
I heard you were here.
There's no such thing as mono-orangosis.

23:11.245 --> 23:13.880
Ever since I became famous,
this is happening a lot.

23:13.914 --> 23:15.949
You people are sick, even you, Mom.

23:17.518 --> 23:18.752
Let's go, Chelsa.

23:18.887 --> 23:21.389
- No.
- Give me this. Ungrateful.

23:21.423 --> 23:22.991
Wait! Wait, wait!

23:22.992 --> 23:28.992
