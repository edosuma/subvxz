WEBVTT

00:09.776 --> 00:12.128
Don't do this.

00:12.179 --> 00:14.697
(mug clatters) Save it for the hearing.

00:14.731 --> 00:16.299
It's not what Charlie wants.

00:16.332 --> 00:18.517
(door opens)

00:18.552 --> 00:20.419
(door closes)

00:20.454 --> 00:22.221
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:22.255 --> 00:24.390
- Good morning.
- I'm Mr. Stein.

00:24.424 --> 00:27.410
I'll be presiding at this
consent and capacity hearing.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.245
Which of you is Dr. Bell?

00:29.279 --> 00:30.529
I am.

00:30.563 --> 00:32.898
Dr. Bell, because you submitted
your application first,

00:32.916 --> 00:34.917
you and your lawyer will
be presenting first.

00:34.951 --> 00:37.420
Dr. Reid, you and your lawyer
will have the opportunity

00:37.454 --> 00:39.372
to ask questions afterwards.

00:39.406 --> 00:42.908
No cross-talk. Let's begin.

00:50.856 --> 00:52.435
T.G.I.F.

00:52.469 --> 00:56.939
- Excuse me?
- This girl is <i>freaky.</i>

00:58.424 --> 00:59.659
Plans this weekend?

00:59.753 --> 01:01.360
Work out and sleep.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.646
Ah, sleeping... lucky.

01:03.697 --> 01:05.931
My sister and her cute
but very colicky baby

01:05.949 --> 01:07.400
are coming to stay with me.

01:07.434 --> 01:09.869
Rub it with soft sponges.
Little orange suckers.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.104
- Huh.
- Swimming through medical school.

01:12.685 --> 01:14.189
Yeah, I was hoping you
could do me one better.

01:14.260 --> 01:15.121
Can I stay at your place?

01:15.149 --> 01:17.883
- At my place.
- It's not a step towards anything.

01:17.921 --> 01:18.961
Don't freak out.
It's just a couple nights.

01:18.995 --> 01:21.951
I'm not freaking out.
Um, can I think about it?

01:21.984 --> 01:23.782
- What's there to think about?
- I just... I don't know.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.551
Haven't solidified any plans.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.619
Oh. Your plans suck.

01:32.024 --> 01:34.493
This is Charlie and I hiking in Colorado.

01:34.527 --> 01:37.045
He once said that if he couldn't do this,

01:37.080 --> 01:38.664
he wouldn't want to live.

01:38.698 --> 01:40.799
He once told me
he couldn't live without pie.

01:41.713 --> 01:42.801
This proves that Dr. Harris valued

01:42.836 --> 01:45.621
a certain... active quality of life.

01:45.655 --> 01:46.705
It's not proof of anything
other than the fact

01:46.723 --> 01:48.006
that he went on a vacation.

01:48.040 --> 01:49.675
It's all useful. We're trying to establish

01:49.709 --> 01:52.161
Dr. Harris' values and his wishes.

01:52.195 --> 01:53.202
Let's move on.

01:53.434 --> 01:56.548
Here's an e-mail dated June 2, 2003.

01:56.566 --> 01:58.183
Thank you.

01:58.217 --> 02:00.969
Charlie wrote,
"just got back from the I.C.U.,"

02:01.004 --> 02:03.138
"seeing my osteosarcoma man."

02:03.173 --> 02:05.858
"Feeding tube, respirator,
the whole nine yards."

02:05.892 --> 02:10.829
"Don't let me go out like that,
darling. Promise."

02:10.864 --> 02:14.199
(sighs) Two months ago, you came to me,

02:14.233 --> 02:18.821
you looked me in the eye,
and you said, "try everything."

02:18.855 --> 02:20.706
You begged me,
and now I'm doing all of that.

02:20.740 --> 02:22.958
Why? Why the 180?

02:23.009 --> 02:26.578
Well, this is the thing.
We <i>have</i> tried everything,

02:26.613 --> 02:27.946
and he's just degenerating.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.097
His hand moved.

02:29.132 --> 02:30.549
Once. Two months ago.

02:30.583 --> 02:31.800
Involuntary movement happens

02:31.851 --> 02:33.519
in a persistent vegetative state.

02:33.553 --> 02:35.220
He's minimally conscious.

02:35.254 --> 02:36.355
If that's the best that we can hope for,

02:36.389 --> 02:38.524
then there is no hope.

02:38.558 --> 02:41.260
I feel that Charlie is here.

02:41.294 --> 02:43.445
I'm guided by that in everything I do.

02:43.479 --> 02:46.231
I know he wants to be kept alive.

02:46.265 --> 02:48.734
I believe that Charlie would
wanna die with dignity.

02:48.768 --> 02:50.485
He's still alive.

02:52.104 --> 02:54.072
And he'd wanna be kept that way.

02:54.106 --> 02:56.124
I have chart extracts from
two of Charlie's patients

02:56.159 --> 02:57.943
who became comatose.

02:57.961 --> 03:00.278
It shows that he's supportive
of a full code status.

03:00.296 --> 03:01.413
Do you have, uh, consent

03:01.447 --> 03:03.031
for the release of his
patient information?

03:03.066 --> 03:06.001
Yes, I do.

03:08.271 --> 03:09.721
He's in the I.C.U.

03:09.756 --> 03:14.459
He's had pneumonia.
He's a 6 on the Glasgow coma scale.

03:14.477 --> 03:16.562
He's basically a horizontal corpse.

03:16.596 --> 03:18.730
I know that sounds horrible,

03:18.765 --> 03:20.916
but that's how Charlie would have seen it.

03:20.950 --> 03:22.434
I see him every day, Dawn,

03:22.468 --> 03:25.153
unlike you, and I know
he's here because I'm here.

03:25.777 --> 03:27.389
Dr. Reid wants to keep him alive

03:27.423 --> 03:29.975
because she can't bear to let him go.

03:29.993 --> 03:31.910
She's too close to him to see

03:31.945 --> 03:34.563
- what Charlie would have wanted.
- How?

03:34.597 --> 03:36.815
How can you be too close
to the person you love?

03:36.833 --> 03:38.333
The day of the accident,
Charlie came to me,

03:38.368 --> 03:41.820
and he asked me
how many chilren I wanted to have.

03:46.259 --> 03:47.793
Charlie is a doctor.

03:47.827 --> 03:50.262
Above everything, he heals people,

03:50.296 --> 03:51.380
and as chief of surgery,

03:51.431 --> 03:53.015
he never gave up on a patient, ever.

03:53.049 --> 03:54.266
Now he's the patient.

03:54.300 --> 03:56.635
He wouldn't want us to give up on him.

03:58.221 --> 04:01.172
(indistinct conversations)

04:03.000 --> 04:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:19.125 --> 04:20.492
I have butterflies.

04:20.526 --> 04:21.692
New heart. Pretty big deal.

04:24.714 --> 04:28.250
- I heard Dr. Bell is petitioning...
- Not the time.

04:45.518 --> 04:47.152
You see me.

04:47.186 --> 04:48.520
- Yeah.
- Ohh.

04:48.554 --> 04:50.238
They're taking my heart, man.

04:50.585 --> 04:52.453
You won't need it.

04:59.213 --> 05:02.467
The big risk is that the body
could reject the heart.

05:02.501 --> 05:04.874
The immune system sees
it as a foreign object

05:04.917 --> 05:06.638
and starts fighting it immediately.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.490
Dr. Reid?

05:08.524 --> 05:09.591
You okay?

05:09.625 --> 05:10.631
Yeah.

05:11.298 --> 05:12.352
I'm fine.

05:12.523 --> 05:14.812
Fine. More importantly,
how are you feeling?

05:14.847 --> 05:16.181
(scoffs)

05:16.232 --> 05:17.965
Well, I'm about to have
a heart transplant.

05:17.983 --> 05:21.098
True, but it is the simplest
cardiac surgery you can have,

05:21.183 --> 05:22.243
believe it or not.

05:22.300 --> 05:23.605
Poor Grace.

05:23.639 --> 05:26.274
I propose, she says "yes," and I get sick.

05:26.308 --> 05:29.143
I can't believe she's still around.

05:29.161 --> 05:30.945
- She loves you.
- I'm a lucky guy.

05:30.979 --> 05:32.980
Hi. What else do we need to do?

05:32.998 --> 05:35.149
I'm... I can't believe I forgot my list.

05:35.167 --> 05:36.751
I'm a virgo.

05:36.785 --> 05:38.169
That's what she does.

05:38.204 --> 05:40.455
She makes lists to
remind her to make lists.

05:40.489 --> 05:42.156
Shut up and hold my hand.

05:44.677 --> 05:45.793
(telephone ringing)

05:46.460 --> 05:47.581
Sergeant Hellard.

05:47.633 --> 05:49.047
(police radio chatter)

05:49.081 --> 05:51.316
- I'm Dr. Goran.
- Hey. Jimmy.

05:51.750 --> 05:53.517
You're the one that came in
with the heart transplant.

05:53.552 --> 05:55.419
Yeah. Yeah, but I'm leaving with a kidney,

05:55.454 --> 05:57.404
so I figured I might as well
get this back checked out

05:57.422 --> 05:59.073
- while I wait.
- Well, what's happened with your back?

05:59.091 --> 06:01.075
Yeah. Yeah, it's, uh, really killing me.

06:01.093 --> 06:04.712
I must have tweaked it,
you know, driving, whatever.

06:04.746 --> 06:06.347
Right. Well, let's take
a look at her, then.

06:06.381 --> 06:08.382
Take a seat up here.

06:08.416 --> 06:09.383
You'll have to lift up your shirt.

06:09.417 --> 06:10.384
Is that thing loaded?

06:10.418 --> 06:11.686
That's what she said.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.305
(chuckles) (radio chatter continues)

06:14.356 --> 06:16.390
All right.

06:16.424 --> 06:18.926
(exhales deeply)

06:19.007 --> 06:21.027
So does the pain radiate
from your lower back?

06:21.098 --> 06:21.778
Yeah. Yeah.

06:21.813 --> 06:24.398
Yeah. Goes down my whole leg.

06:24.432 --> 06:26.534
And what about your bladder habits?

06:26.568 --> 06:28.252
Notice any changes lately?

06:28.286 --> 06:31.956
I am proud to say I still pee standing up.

06:31.990 --> 06:33.607
Well, that's a pride you should maintain.

06:33.625 --> 06:36.043
What about sexual function?
Anything different?

06:36.078 --> 06:38.879
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're
getting a little personal, doc.

06:38.914 --> 06:40.881
Can't you just write me a ticket?

06:40.916 --> 06:43.467
You know, from your little pad? Script?

06:43.502 --> 06:45.336
Well, this is a surgical consult,

06:45.387 --> 06:47.421
and I don't know what's wrong
with you yet. (pen clicks)

06:47.936 --> 06:49.525
But we'll get you an M.R.I.

06:49.880 --> 06:51.076
You hang tight.

06:51.247 --> 06:55.513
Hey. The, uh, heart I came in with...

06:55.564 --> 06:56.897
Who's getting it?

06:56.932 --> 06:58.899
Uh, some nice young kid, apparently.

06:58.934 --> 07:00.134
What about the donor?

07:00.152 --> 07:02.236
Some guy's who's doing time in Maplehurst.

07:02.882 --> 07:04.202
- Prisoner?
- Yeah.

07:04.557 --> 07:06.073
Got into a fight.

07:06.108 --> 07:08.142
Someone caved his head in with a barbell.

07:09.353 --> 07:10.200
Hey.

07:10.275 --> 07:13.280
What's the most gruesome thing
you've ever seen on the job?

07:14.561 --> 07:16.836
Guy walked in off the street
and his head fell off.

07:18.554 --> 07:19.816
That's pretty good.

07:21.507 --> 07:23.457
(chuckles)

07:25.594 --> 07:30.147
That's my heart, my kidney, my spleen.

07:30.182 --> 07:31.566
That's disgusting, by the way.

07:31.600 --> 07:32.984
That's your lungs and your liver, too.

07:33.018 --> 07:34.268
You're dead.

07:34.302 --> 07:37.905
Still mind. Besides,
what anybody ever do for me?

07:37.940 --> 07:40.525
- You signed the organ donor card.
- No, I didn't. I don't sign things.

07:40.576 --> 07:42.765
What, just as a rule,
you don't sign things?

07:42.826 --> 07:43.466
That's right.

07:43.683 --> 07:44.745
Well, they probably
called your family, then.

07:44.780 --> 07:46.146
My family.

07:47.221 --> 07:48.683
They get paid for this?

07:48.717 --> 07:50.334
No, they don't.

07:50.369 --> 07:52.003
Why not? My organs aren't worth nothing?

07:52.037 --> 07:54.288
- Is that what you're saying?
- No, but th-that's not the point.

07:54.322 --> 07:57.124
I mean, look, you die,
they gut you like a fish.

07:57.158 --> 07:59.293
It's the gift of life.

07:59.327 --> 08:01.462
- Really?
- Yep.

08:01.496 --> 08:02.964
That's all right.

08:02.998 --> 08:04.181
Yeah.

08:04.216 --> 08:05.633
Doing a very good thing,

08:05.667 --> 08:07.935
so godspeed.

08:07.970 --> 08:09.270
What, am I going somewhere?

08:09.304 --> 08:14.041
Uh... yeah, you should be, any minute now.

08:20.181 --> 08:23.017
- Hey, what's he getting?
- Uh, your heart, probably.

08:23.035 --> 08:24.652
Well, he's so young.
What's he need a new heart for?

08:24.686 --> 08:27.455
I don't know. Uh, Bernie,
I'm gonna... I'll see you around.

08:31.860 --> 08:34.794
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

08:39.551 --> 08:43.971
- How did the hearing go?
- I don't know.

08:46.475 --> 08:49.209
And, uh, what's the deal
with the transplant?

08:49.227 --> 08:51.929
I diagnosed this guy a year ago.
Total fluke.

08:51.980 --> 08:54.348
He'd be dead in a month
without this heart.

08:54.382 --> 08:56.400
Things are gonna work out.

08:58.236 --> 08:59.093
Alex...

08:59.684 --> 09:00.223
if you need...

09:00.242 --> 09:02.389
You're gonna be nice. Don't do it.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.070
Well, I'm around, okay?

09:07.205 --> 09:08.066
Yeah.

09:09.397 --> 09:13.034
(saw buzzing)

09:13.068 --> 09:14.702
Almost done. (buzzing stops)

09:14.736 --> 09:17.755
Okay. Lungs back on.

09:17.789 --> 09:19.006
Turn the blood pressure down.

09:19.041 --> 09:20.091
(beeps) Lungs on.

09:20.125 --> 09:21.575
Pressure's coming down.

09:21.593 --> 09:23.210
Have you ever scrubbed in
for a transplant before?

09:23.244 --> 09:25.379
No. Well, you're in for a treat.

09:25.413 --> 09:27.414
- Where's Dr. Levine?
- He's on his way.

09:27.432 --> 09:28.933
Let's keep rolling.

09:28.967 --> 09:30.518
(clank)

09:30.552 --> 09:33.270
And there we are.

09:33.305 --> 09:36.974
Why is Dr. Bell scrubbing in?
This can't be happening.

09:37.025 --> 09:38.275
Okay. (clank)

09:38.310 --> 09:40.394
All right, first,
we'll open the pericardium

09:40.428 --> 09:41.946
and do a bicaval cannulation.

09:41.980 --> 09:43.447
Cautery forceps to me.

09:45.317 --> 09:47.935
Dr. Levine is out. He ate a bad oyster.

09:47.953 --> 09:49.904
He's barfing in his car.

09:49.938 --> 09:51.939
I didn't know you had privileges here.

09:51.957 --> 09:55.159
Uh, they e-mail every year, send a check.

09:55.210 --> 09:57.662
I'm Dawn, everyone.
I do everything Dr. Levine does,

09:57.713 --> 09:59.463
only faster.

09:59.498 --> 10:02.283
- Where are we at?
- Dr. Reid's just opened the sternum.

10:02.317 --> 10:04.468
Good, 'cause she's in my spot.

10:29.828 --> 10:33.313
Hey. Nice place.

10:33.331 --> 10:36.083
Yeah. It's, uh, it's quiet.

10:36.118 --> 10:37.918
Yeah, quiet's good.

10:37.953 --> 10:39.486
Usually.

10:39.504 --> 10:41.455
Uh, listen, you know,

10:41.489 --> 10:43.257
normally, I'm up for this whole,
uh, meeting new people thing,

10:43.291 --> 10:45.509
but not today.

10:45.544 --> 10:47.328
Yeah? Why not today?

10:47.362 --> 10:48.362
I mean, if this is what I think it is,

10:48.397 --> 10:50.464
and today's the same as yesterday,

10:50.499 --> 10:53.601
unless I'm mistaken,
we can walk outta here anytime we want.

10:53.635 --> 10:55.436
No.

10:58.974 --> 11:00.191
So when you're dead,

11:00.225 --> 11:02.610
you go back to jail. It figures.

11:02.644 --> 11:04.645
(whispers) Yeah.

11:04.679 --> 11:05.946
(Dawn) Where's the new heart?

11:05.981 --> 11:07.114
(Maggie) Right here.

11:07.149 --> 11:08.365
Okay, don't drop it.

11:11.203 --> 11:13.287
You know, Charlie and
I were pregnant once.

11:13.321 --> 11:15.239
I think that we'd
probably still be together

11:15.290 --> 11:17.541
if things had worked out.

11:17.576 --> 11:20.044
You need a minute, Dr. Reid?

11:20.078 --> 11:23.697
No. I'm fine.

11:23.715 --> 11:27.367
All right. Here's this bad boy.

11:27.385 --> 11:30.838
Here you go.

11:31.540 --> 11:33.591
Excellent. Okay.

11:33.642 --> 11:35.375
I'm gonna start with the left atrium.

11:35.393 --> 11:37.261
I.V.C., S.V.C., pulmonary artery,

11:37.312 --> 11:38.846
and then the aorta,

11:38.880 --> 11:40.848
in that order.

11:40.882 --> 11:42.982
So they're deciding
whether to pull the plug on you.

11:43.029 --> 11:43.918
Yep, pretty much.

11:43.952 --> 11:45.853
Ooh, big day.

11:45.887 --> 11:47.221
Yeah.

11:47.239 --> 11:49.690
I mean, how do you face this?

11:49.724 --> 11:51.058
I couldn't tell you.

11:51.076 --> 11:52.326
Took a barbell to the side of the head.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.744
Didn't see it coming. (chuckles)

11:53.779 --> 11:56.330
I meant before that.

11:56.364 --> 11:58.332
Oh, before that. Uh...

11:58.366 --> 12:00.201
just did what I had to do.

12:00.235 --> 12:02.336
And when that didn't pan out for you?

12:02.370 --> 12:04.238
Did something else.

12:04.256 --> 12:05.706
Mm.

12:05.740 --> 12:07.074
What's up?

12:07.092 --> 12:12.096
Mm. Something. This is a new sensation.

12:12.130 --> 12:14.765
New could be good.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.500
I think I'm in pain.

12:16.535 --> 12:19.770
Yeah. I'm definitely in pain.

12:19.805 --> 12:22.189
Good news.

12:22.224 --> 12:23.423
No need for surgery.

12:23.441 --> 12:26.277
Your, uh, M.R.I. shows no disc herniation

12:26.311 --> 12:27.695
and no nerve impingement.

12:27.729 --> 12:29.763
Well, great. So you gonna
write me my script?

12:29.781 --> 12:30.898
You really don't need one.

12:30.932 --> 12:32.867
I really do, actually.

12:32.901 --> 12:34.451
I'm in a lot of pain here, doc.

12:34.486 --> 12:35.703
Mechanical back pain.

12:36.165 --> 12:37.204
It's probably 'cause your core muscles

12:37.239 --> 12:38.441
need a bit of strengthening.

12:38.488 --> 12:40.124
I'll set you up with some physiotherapy

12:40.158 --> 12:42.442
and, um, like, an exercise regimen.

12:42.460 --> 12:43.577
Like yoga?

12:43.611 --> 12:44.962
Or pilates.

12:44.996 --> 12:46.247
(scoffs) Come on, doc. Look at me.

12:46.281 --> 12:47.948
I'm not gonna lie on the floor,

12:47.983 --> 12:49.550
roll around on a mat.

12:49.584 --> 12:51.585
Well, I'm telling you
how to fix your problem.

12:51.619 --> 12:53.420
You wanna fix my problem?

12:53.454 --> 12:55.489
Write me the script.

12:58.117 --> 12:59.476
Okay.

12:59.511 --> 13:01.345
Thank you.

13:01.396 --> 13:03.797
(police radio chatter)

13:03.815 --> 13:05.766
Oh. (clears throat)

13:05.800 --> 13:08.402
And I can top your, uh,
head falling off story,

13:08.436 --> 13:10.855
by the way.

13:10.906 --> 13:13.307
Go into a house,

13:13.325 --> 13:14.909
little girl answers the door,

13:14.943 --> 13:17.111
turns out her mother hanged
herself in the basement.

13:18.215 --> 13:19.033
Ha.

13:19.164 --> 13:20.831
That's good, right?

13:20.866 --> 13:22.816
That is pretty gruesome.

13:22.834 --> 13:24.752
(scribbles)

13:24.786 --> 13:26.253
(paper tears)

13:26.288 --> 13:29.123
(paper rustles)

13:29.157 --> 13:30.791
(monitor beeping steadily)

13:30.825 --> 13:32.492
What's she looking at?

13:34.880 --> 13:36.463
I have an embollism.

13:36.497 --> 13:39.133
- Is that bad?
- It can be, very.

13:39.167 --> 13:41.501
- Doc Tolliver?
- Charlie's latest C.T. angio.

13:41.519 --> 13:43.170
He's got a pulmonary embollism.

13:43.188 --> 13:44.438
Oh, you're good.

13:44.472 --> 13:45.940
- Hmm.
- Page Alex.

13:45.974 --> 13:47.007
Okay.

13:48.193 --> 13:49.460
Awesome.

13:49.494 --> 13:51.812
Okay, let's unclamp him.

13:51.846 --> 13:54.031
Wean the pump.

13:54.065 --> 13:55.515
(beeps)

13:55.533 --> 13:58.986
(beeping steadily)

13:59.020 --> 14:00.687
That is incredible.

14:00.705 --> 14:03.457
Okay, let's go off on pump. (beeps)

14:03.491 --> 14:06.026
And we're off bypass now. (beeps)

14:06.044 --> 14:07.661
Gonna remove the lines.

14:07.695 --> 14:10.030
(suction gurgling)

14:10.048 --> 14:12.532
I don't see any blood. Looks good.

14:12.550 --> 14:15.169
Give him protamine. Glove change, please.

14:15.203 --> 14:18.205
(beeps)

14:18.223 --> 14:19.256
- Dawn.
- Yeah?

14:19.307 --> 14:20.641
There's bleeding.

14:20.675 --> 14:23.543
- You gave him the protamine?
- Yeah, I did.

14:23.561 --> 14:25.729
Well, it's getting worse.
There's definitely a bleed here.

14:25.764 --> 14:27.731
Okay, let me in there. (raid beeps)

14:27.766 --> 14:30.067
Okay, it's not the aorta.
We need to go back on pump.

14:30.101 --> 14:31.852
- We can't.
- God.

14:31.886 --> 14:33.520
Is it the P.A.? I'm not seeing it.

14:33.554 --> 14:35.406
- I can't get in there.
- Let me look. Let me look.

14:36.741 --> 14:38.659
(beeping continues) Okay. Just hold that.

14:38.693 --> 14:40.411
There. There's the tear.

14:40.445 --> 14:42.363
Okay, give me a 4-0 prolene.

14:42.397 --> 14:43.697
A longer needle driver! (clatter)

14:43.731 --> 14:46.033
- I can't reach it with that!
- Give her an 8-inch.

14:46.067 --> 14:47.501
(woman) He's got no blood pressure.

14:47.535 --> 14:49.569
Okay, come on, Kyle.
(beeps, monitor emitting continuous tone)

14:49.587 --> 14:52.089
- I can't see it from this angle.
- Yeah. I think I've got it.

14:52.123 --> 14:54.925
- Are you sure?
- I can see it.

14:56.291 --> 14:57.928
Okay, that artery wall is like wet tissue.

14:57.963 --> 14:59.213
I've got it.

14:59.247 --> 15:02.016
Okay, you get one shot.
Put a stitch in it.

15:11.943 --> 15:14.261
Suction.

15:14.279 --> 15:17.364
(suction gurgles)

15:17.399 --> 15:20.534
(beeps) Bleeding stopped.

15:20.568 --> 15:22.820
(sighs deeply)

15:22.871 --> 15:25.122
(beeps)

15:25.156 --> 15:27.574
Give him epi. (rapid beeps)

15:27.608 --> 15:29.293
50...

15:29.327 --> 15:30.744
52...

15:30.778 --> 15:32.446
(whispers) Come on.

15:32.464 --> 15:33.881
60.

15:33.915 --> 15:36.583
(beeps) 70.

15:36.617 --> 15:37.751
We're good.

15:37.785 --> 15:39.970
(sighs) Nice work.

15:40.005 --> 15:43.290
Thank you.

15:50.198 --> 15:52.109
A hat that fits the head of a newborn

15:52.182 --> 15:55.801
should not take this long to knit.

15:56.324 --> 15:58.670
Great. Somebody took my quesadilla.

15:58.838 --> 16:01.140
How do you just eat
somebody else's lunch, huh?

16:01.174 --> 16:04.176
That is a serious, serious violation.

16:04.440 --> 16:06.312
Doctors are scavengers.

16:06.346 --> 16:09.514
Yeah, they'll take it
any way they can get it.

16:09.690 --> 16:12.476
He's colicky. He's gonna bawl
whether he likes it or not.

16:12.935 --> 16:13.869
How are you gonna study?

16:14.184 --> 16:15.988
Dr. Goran recommended an
excellent brand of earplug.

16:16.022 --> 16:18.607
- Mmm. (chuckles)
- So...

16:18.642 --> 16:20.793
(mouth full) You can crash at my place.

16:20.827 --> 16:22.461
Really?

16:22.495 --> 16:23.629
Yeah.

16:23.663 --> 16:26.298
Thank you. You're a prince.

16:26.333 --> 16:29.335
You know what? Screw it. Gift shop.

16:29.675 --> 16:31.467
I'm buying one of these bad boys.

16:36.559 --> 16:38.210
So you gonna hang with Maggie
and her sister this weekend?

16:38.228 --> 16:40.312
Uh, no.

16:40.347 --> 16:42.214
(chuckles)

16:42.232 --> 16:44.066
What was that?

16:44.100 --> 16:45.317
Hmm?

16:45.352 --> 16:48.153
Maggie doesn't even
wanna hang out with her.

16:48.188 --> 16:49.738
I'm not getting involved
in your whole deal.

16:49.773 --> 16:51.707
No one's asking you to.

16:51.741 --> 16:53.158
Well, actually, you're fishing

16:53.193 --> 16:54.860
for a kinda tacit approval from me.
I'm not giving it.

16:54.894 --> 16:56.028
What does that mean?

16:56.062 --> 16:57.529
It means that you're asking me

16:57.563 --> 16:59.331
to say it's okay for you to
do something when it's not.

16:59.366 --> 17:01.700
Right. Her friend.

17:01.734 --> 17:03.035
Yeah. (clears throat)

17:03.069 --> 17:05.371
What? Don't think men and
women can be friends?

17:05.494 --> 17:07.789
(pen clicks) Not really, no.

17:10.305 --> 17:11.676
Interesting.

17:12.244 --> 17:13.345
(monitor beeping steadily)

17:13.380 --> 17:14.680
(speaks indistinctly)

17:14.714 --> 17:16.598
- 10 units.
- Where's the clot?

17:16.932 --> 17:18.800
It started in his groin,
but it's moved up to his chest.

17:18.852 --> 17:20.352
We're trying to break it up.

17:20.387 --> 17:21.920
- He'll be fine.
- Pfft, pfft, pfft!

17:23.138 --> 17:25.257
I worked in an orthodox old age home

17:25.275 --> 17:26.724
before coming here.

17:26.759 --> 17:28.109
It's a jewish thing.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.785
Hi. Coffee, black, please.

17:36.820 --> 17:37.820
(coins clatter)

17:37.871 --> 17:41.240
(indistinct conversations)

17:44.678 --> 17:47.162
(elevator bell dings, doors open)

17:47.213 --> 17:48.213
Here you go.

17:48.552 --> 17:49.639
Thank you.

17:50.633 --> 17:51.633
(cash register beeping)

17:51.668 --> 17:53.969
Dawn.

17:54.003 --> 17:56.055
Why are you doing this?

17:56.089 --> 17:58.290
Do you really wanna
have this conversation?

18:01.177 --> 18:02.778
Yeah, I do.

18:02.812 --> 18:04.980
If Charlie were any other patient,

18:05.014 --> 18:06.732
you would see this my way.

18:10.070 --> 18:12.071
No, I...

18:12.105 --> 18:13.355
I wouldn't.

18:16.976 --> 18:20.312
(sighs) Dawn, you know Charlie,

18:20.330 --> 18:22.814
- and he is a fighter...
- Okay, that's it.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.666
What's it?

18:24.701 --> 18:28.003
"He's a fighter"
is something that families say

18:28.037 --> 18:29.788
or the loved ones of patients.

18:29.822 --> 18:33.092
We as doctors... we know
that nobody is a fighter.

18:33.126 --> 18:34.510
I don't know that.

18:34.544 --> 18:36.178
Okay, well, you will when
you get more experience.

18:36.212 --> 18:38.714
Dawn, every patient is different.

18:38.765 --> 18:40.349
No, they seem unique,

18:40.383 --> 18:44.019
but the body is the body,
and you need to be realistic.

18:44.053 --> 18:45.148
Or pessimistic.

18:45.642 --> 18:48.506
I don't get why
you don't see what I'm saying.

18:48.525 --> 18:51.527
You're saying that you wanna kill Charlie.

18:51.561 --> 18:53.721
- That is ridiculous.
- (voice breaking) No, it's not.

18:53.764 --> 18:55.230
That is what you're saying,

18:55.281 --> 18:58.033
and I am <i>never gonna
understand that.</i>

18:58.067 --> 19:00.152
You are making this about you,

19:00.186 --> 19:02.121
and it's about Charlie.

19:02.339 --> 19:04.456
Melanda, Shahir... they're humoring you

19:04.491 --> 19:05.541
because you're their friend,

19:05.575 --> 19:06.825
and they see how much you love him.

19:06.859 --> 19:09.745
But the science just isn't there, Alex.

19:11.664 --> 19:13.365
Charlie would tell you the same thing.

19:13.383 --> 19:15.884
You're wrong.

19:18.109 --> 19:19.037
Shouldn't have talked to you.

19:29.882 --> 19:31.216
I was just sitting here with him,

19:31.234 --> 19:32.601
and he got really weak.
(monitor beeping steadily)

19:32.652 --> 19:34.553
I feel awful.

19:34.587 --> 19:36.104
It looks like your body
is rejecting the heart.

19:36.156 --> 19:38.440
Let's get him an endomyocardial biopsy

19:38.491 --> 19:40.943
to confirm the rejection.

19:40.994 --> 19:42.727
We'll give him 1,000 milligrams
of methylprednisolone.

19:42.745 --> 19:44.196
Sounds scary.

19:44.230 --> 19:45.697
It's just more steroids.

19:45.731 --> 19:47.149
What does this mean?

19:47.183 --> 19:49.334
Don't worry. We were ready for this.

19:49.369 --> 19:50.786
The drugs are gonna work?

19:50.837 --> 19:52.087
Well, if they don't,
then we'll get him started

19:52.121 --> 19:53.455
on plasma exchange.

19:53.506 --> 19:55.040
He's a fighter.

19:55.074 --> 19:56.291
Excellent.

20:01.714 --> 20:03.682
We come up here to check on him,

20:03.716 --> 20:04.916
and his body's rejecting my heart.

20:04.934 --> 20:07.085
What?

20:07.103 --> 20:09.354
That's a coincidence, Bernie. (scoffs)

20:09.389 --> 20:12.057
Nah, man. It's me.

20:17.564 --> 20:21.450
(telephone ringing in distance)

20:21.484 --> 20:24.436
(police radio chatter)

20:37.050 --> 20:39.334
(chatter continues)

20:39.385 --> 20:41.720
You'll page me? Hold on.

20:41.754 --> 20:42.971
Can I help you?

20:50.847 --> 20:52.097
Officer.

20:52.131 --> 20:55.800
Hey. Um, is that
the kid who got the heart?

20:55.818 --> 20:57.769
Yeah, but you really shouldn't be in here.

20:57.803 --> 20:59.271
Can I go in and say hi?

20:59.305 --> 21:00.606
No, sorry, you can't.

21:00.640 --> 21:02.274
Come on. I just wanna say hi.

21:02.308 --> 21:04.359
No, you really can't.

21:04.410 --> 21:07.362
Okay. (laughs)

21:07.413 --> 21:10.649
But you tell him that, uh,
Jimmy Howard stopped by.

21:10.667 --> 21:11.950
Do you know him?

21:11.984 --> 21:14.202
No, I came in with the heart.

21:14.254 --> 21:15.704
Hey, I'll tell him you
were here, all right?

21:17.673 --> 21:18.990
Tell him best of luck from me.

21:19.008 --> 21:21.927
I'll let him know.

21:21.961 --> 21:23.211
Okay.

21:29.001 --> 21:30.969
What was that?

21:31.003 --> 21:33.338
I don't know. That cop is high as a kite.

21:35.091 --> 21:37.075
You think he's gonna make it?

21:37.110 --> 21:38.327
I don't know.

21:38.361 --> 21:39.945
If you were a betting man...

21:39.979 --> 21:41.179
(monitor beeping steadily)

21:42.269 --> 21:43.787
Look, I had a bad heart.

21:45.684 --> 21:47.653
(clears throat) There's no such thing
as a bad heart, Bernie.

21:47.687 --> 21:50.689
You don't know me.

21:50.707 --> 21:51.907
There are no bad hearts.

21:51.958 --> 21:55.360
There are bad choices
you make in your life.

21:57.726 --> 21:59.174
I killed two people.

22:05.171 --> 22:08.156
Well, maybe now's your
chance to do something good.

22:08.191 --> 22:10.709
Things change, Bernie.

22:10.727 --> 22:12.861
People can change.

22:14.792 --> 22:16.254
What if it's like Frankenstein?

22:16.301 --> 22:18.245
You know, like, what if the heart takes,

22:18.283 --> 22:19.721
and-and he becomes like me?

22:19.759 --> 22:20.629
Make your peace.

22:21.554 --> 22:22.688
With my heart?

22:26.242 --> 22:31.780
Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Why not?

22:31.831 --> 22:34.783
I mean, it's here. You're here.

22:34.834 --> 22:36.718
(sighs) Why not?

22:43.676 --> 22:45.844
He doesn't have a lot of time, Bernie.

23:03.429 --> 23:07.616
Listen-listen, this is a nice guy.

23:07.650 --> 23:12.738
So, um, all I'm saying is
that you learn to ignore

23:12.772 --> 23:16.825
to-to survive.

23:16.876 --> 23:18.710
And let him go.

23:21.080 --> 23:22.947
Be good, man. (chuckles)

23:31.240 --> 23:32.724
I'm sorry.

23:34.627 --> 23:35.794
I'm sorry.

23:38.514 --> 23:40.599
(rapid beeps)

23:40.633 --> 23:41.783
Hey, what's that?

23:41.818 --> 23:43.468
That's the heart monitor.

23:45.702 --> 23:47.528
Hey, don't tell me I killed the guy, man.

23:47.573 --> 23:48.073
No.

23:48.786 --> 23:49.917
It's good.

23:50.829 --> 23:52.655
It's very good.

23:53.705 --> 23:55.876
Cardiac function is good.

23:56.032 --> 23:59.951
We'll watch your urine output,
but these are great signs.

23:59.985 --> 24:02.337
- (Alex) They really are.
- And the drugs are working?

24:02.564 --> 24:04.005
Well, we're not out of the woods yet,

24:04.040 --> 24:07.876
but looks like the heart is ticking.

24:07.927 --> 24:09.094
Thank you.

24:16.338 --> 24:17.497
Alex...

24:19.188 --> 24:20.555
I'll see you in there.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.459
Sergeant Howard?

24:44.287 --> 24:45.612
Jimmy?

24:46.600 --> 24:48.128
Oh, hey.

24:48.466 --> 24:50.484
You can't be sleeping
in a patient bed, man.

24:50.518 --> 24:51.869
Ohh.

24:51.903 --> 24:53.153
Those are some heavy duty drugs

24:53.188 --> 24:55.356
you gave me there, boss.

24:55.407 --> 24:57.741
Ohh. Knocked me right out.

24:58.274 --> 24:59.410
You have to drive.

24:59.444 --> 25:01.121
No, I'm fine.

25:03.165 --> 25:04.782
Hey, what does this remind you of?

25:05.312 --> 25:06.483
Sleeping?

25:08.041 --> 25:09.541
Camping.

25:10.591 --> 25:12.909
Lying out under the stars.

25:13.590 --> 25:14.892
You ever do that?

25:15.429 --> 25:18.518
Yeah. Sure, I've done a
little bit of camping before.

25:18.608 --> 25:20.845
Honestly, sergeant, you can't be in here.

25:22.874 --> 25:26.053
I'm a cop. I can be anywhere I want.

25:26.104 --> 25:27.938
(sighs)

25:27.972 --> 25:30.324
So you never just take a nap, huh?

25:30.358 --> 25:33.060
Never? All these beds,

25:33.111 --> 25:34.411
I would be very tempted. (chuckles)

25:34.446 --> 25:35.562
Not really. I mean,

25:35.597 --> 25:37.481
What, do you sleep in
the back of your cruiser?

25:37.679 --> 25:40.284
What, are you kidding me?
It's filthy back there.

25:40.318 --> 25:43.287
Yeah, there's germs everywhere.

25:43.321 --> 25:44.605
(sighs)

25:44.639 --> 25:47.157
At least germs didn't
choose to be germs, right?

25:50.280 --> 25:53.497
(chuckles) Okay. I'm going.

25:53.908 --> 25:54.665
Hey, look, you know what?

25:54.699 --> 25:57.367
You're more than welcome to, um...

25:57.385 --> 25:59.753
I can hook you up with a...
like, a cool room,

25:59.804 --> 26:03.707
just someplace where you can nap if you...

26:05.146 --> 26:07.133
Guys like you and me...

26:08.313 --> 26:10.213
we are what we do.

26:16.354 --> 26:18.072
I'm gonna tell you the
worst thing I ever saw.

26:18.106 --> 26:20.157
I'm not kidding now... I...

26:20.191 --> 26:22.693
I'm not sure that I can handle that.

26:24.993 --> 26:27.498
Uh, well, probably smart.

26:33.538 --> 26:36.457
(indistinct conversations)

26:41.880 --> 26:44.181
You found Jimmy.

26:44.215 --> 26:46.049
How did I end up with this guy?

26:46.067 --> 26:47.901
Well, you wrote him a script.

26:47.936 --> 26:49.386
He seemed legit.

26:49.404 --> 26:51.054
No, the guy's a mess.

26:51.072 --> 26:52.689
What did he give you,
the back or the knee?

26:52.723 --> 26:54.525
The back.

26:54.559 --> 26:57.561
Figures. Jimmy always
sniffs up the new guys.

26:57.579 --> 26:59.113
Well, somebody could
have told <i>me</i> this.

26:59.147 --> 27:01.665
- Well, it's need-to-know, Goran.
- I need to know, Miller.

27:01.858 --> 27:03.233
Look, he's a sad case.

27:03.251 --> 27:05.002
We help the guy out.

27:05.036 --> 27:06.420
So why is he on ambulance duty?

27:06.454 --> 27:08.672
He's not. He's basically just a chauffeur.

27:08.706 --> 27:10.457
That's all they trust him
with since he lost it.

27:10.841 --> 27:12.126
What do you mean, he lost it?

27:12.177 --> 27:14.211
He shot a kid a few years ago.

27:14.245 --> 27:17.631
A few months later,
drove his cruiser into a brick wall.

27:21.052 --> 27:24.521
Kidneys. Ambulance is all ready for you.

27:24.556 --> 27:27.391
Better go find Jimmy.

27:27.425 --> 27:28.859
(telephone ringing in distance)

27:28.893 --> 27:31.812
(indistinct conversations)

27:40.121 --> 27:42.005
(door opens)

27:43.441 --> 27:45.075
Thank you for waiting.

27:49.380 --> 27:50.998
I've reviewed your statements
and your documents,

27:51.049 --> 27:52.782
and I've reached a decision.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.301
In the eyes of the court,

27:54.335 --> 27:56.503
a fiancée and an ex-wife are the same,

27:56.554 --> 27:59.256
and I find that the person best able

27:59.290 --> 28:01.958
to execute the wishes of Charlie Harris

28:01.976 --> 28:04.595
is Dr. Bell.

28:04.629 --> 28:05.812
Dr. Reid...

28:07.965 --> 28:11.902
you obviously care deeply for him,

28:11.936 --> 28:15.239
but sometimes our feelings
can't be our guide.

28:15.273 --> 28:17.024
I am sorry.

28:23.648 --> 28:25.148
(exhales deeply)

28:29.254 --> 28:31.538
(sighs)

28:32.823 --> 28:34.541
(door squeaks)

28:36.544 --> 28:38.328
(door closes)

28:39.764 --> 28:41.831
Jimmy.

28:41.849 --> 28:44.885
These kidneys are gonna
leave without you, man.

28:44.936 --> 28:47.354
(radio chatter)

28:50.341 --> 28:52.693
Do you wanna put that down, come inside?

28:54.318 --> 28:55.818
No, I'm good here.

28:56.858 --> 28:58.282
I really think you should put the gun...

28:59.091 --> 29:00.500
down, Jimmy.

29:04.521 --> 29:06.110
You wanna talk to me?

29:08.574 --> 29:10.580
What do you wanna talk about?

29:11.479 --> 29:12.479
Well...

29:12.513 --> 29:14.581
I know what happened.

29:16.684 --> 29:19.035
Five years ago today.

29:19.053 --> 29:21.221
It's gotta be really tough.

29:21.256 --> 29:25.542
To live with? It is.

29:28.871 --> 29:31.732
You know, people used to look at
me like I was some kind of hero.

29:33.935 --> 29:37.053
They don't look at me like that anymore.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.682
Why don't you tell me what you want,

29:41.467 --> 29:43.377
right now, and I'll help you?

29:43.723 --> 29:45.879
You already gave me what I wanted.

29:46.405 --> 29:48.065
You mean pills?

29:48.416 --> 29:50.250
Jimmy, that's not the answer.

29:50.285 --> 29:53.287
Neither is this.

29:56.082 --> 29:58.375
Can you make things go
back to how they were?

30:00.060 --> 30:01.843
No.

30:03.080 --> 30:04.548
(chuckles)

30:04.941 --> 30:05.749
No.

30:07.046 --> 30:08.285
I can't.

30:11.469 --> 30:13.607
Then you can't help me.

30:14.058 --> 30:17.260
Okay, we can't go back.

30:17.278 --> 30:18.989
(exhales deeply)
But you can start to think

30:19.023 --> 30:20.096
about your future.

30:20.114 --> 30:22.966
- The future?
- Yes.

30:23.001 --> 30:25.669
The future, Jimmy.

30:25.703 --> 30:27.871
I mean, let this go. Whatever this is...

30:27.905 --> 30:30.540
(sighs) You gotta let it go.

30:30.575 --> 30:33.460
Let it go?

30:33.494 --> 30:36.146
Things'll... they'll get better.

30:36.180 --> 30:38.315
- Right.
- I know.

30:38.349 --> 30:41.752
And you have to believe
me when I tell you this,

30:41.786 --> 30:43.136
that things are gonna get better.

30:45.454 --> 30:47.557
You know, without that belief,
you got nothing.

30:51.896 --> 30:53.046
You're right.

30:53.081 --> 30:54.681
Right.

30:57.518 --> 30:58.968
Jimmy!

30:58.986 --> 31:00.704
(gunshot)

31:02.306 --> 31:07.327
(breathing deeply)

31:15.309 --> 31:16.359
Hey.

31:18.786 --> 31:20.252
I lost.

31:22.480 --> 31:24.088
The hearing.

31:25.157 --> 31:27.177
What am I gonna do?

31:28.556 --> 31:32.876
I honestly don't think
I'm the person to talk to right now.

31:32.911 --> 31:33.969
(sighs)

31:34.002 --> 31:38.715
(sighs) I am... I am terrified.

31:39.337 --> 31:41.852
I am terrified that she's
gonna pull the plug.

31:41.886 --> 31:42.853
I...

31:42.887 --> 31:45.773
I just... I can't breathe.

31:45.824 --> 31:48.692
It's okay. It's okay.

31:48.726 --> 31:51.362
No, it's not.

31:51.396 --> 31:52.863
Well, what can I do?

31:54.804 --> 31:56.479
Nothing.

31:58.801 --> 32:00.187
Alex...

32:02.571 --> 32:06.383
(sighs) Well, this is
completely out of line.

32:06.488 --> 32:07.878
And I know this...

32:16.628 --> 32:18.804
Alex, I-I still...

32:19.027 --> 32:20.332
Don't.

32:21.675 --> 32:22.976
Please.

32:25.545 --> 32:26.580
Just don't.

32:26.615 --> 32:29.733
(siren wailing in distance)

32:36.124 --> 32:37.508
Okay, I should go.

32:45.050 --> 32:47.751
(doors close)

32:47.769 --> 32:49.270
<i>(tone chimes)</i>

32:49.304 --> 32:51.105
<i>(woman over P.A.)

32:51.139 --> 32:55.259
<i>Code blue. I.C.U. room 3.</i>

32:55.277 --> 32:57.444
<i>Code blue. I.C.U. room 3.</i>

32:57.479 --> 32:59.396
Get out of my way!

32:59.430 --> 33:00.814
Crash team's on the way.
(monitor emitting continuous tone)

33:04.286 --> 33:07.204
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

33:07.239 --> 33:08.906
How long has he been in V-fib?

33:08.940 --> 33:10.708
- How long?
- Less than a minute.

33:10.742 --> 33:12.943
Oh, Charlie. Come on, Charlie.

33:12.961 --> 33:14.879
Push 2 milligrams of epi.

33:14.913 --> 33:16.280
Pushing 2 milligrams of epi.

33:16.298 --> 33:18.582
Come on, Charlie. (exhaling sharply)

33:18.616 --> 33:20.301
Charge to 360.

33:20.335 --> 33:21.719
Come on, Charlie. Stay with me.

33:21.753 --> 33:23.954
(continues exhaling sharply)

33:23.972 --> 33:26.140
Charlie, come on! Come on.
(defibrillator whines, monitor beeps)

33:26.174 --> 33:27.457
Alex, you have to get off.

33:27.475 --> 33:28.893
Monitor emitting continuous tone)

33:28.927 --> 33:30.294
- Everyone clear?
- Clear!

33:30.312 --> 33:32.680
(beeps, paddles thunk)

33:32.731 --> 33:34.565
(rapid beeps) Still in V-fib.

33:34.599 --> 33:36.633
Charlie! (rapid beeps)

33:36.651 --> 33:38.936
Okay, we're going again. Alex. (sighs)

33:38.970 --> 33:39.970
Stop! (beeps)

33:42.307 --> 33:44.408
Stop what you're doing.

33:45.994 --> 33:47.494
Melanda, do it.

33:49.147 --> 33:50.114
Melanda, do it!

33:50.148 --> 33:51.415

34:00.658 --> 34:03.010
(whispers) We did it. Okay, baby.

34:04.963 --> 34:06.430
(gasps)

34:06.464 --> 34:08.014
Did you break his ribs?

34:11.436 --> 34:13.103
I don't think so.

34:13.138 --> 34:15.188
Because next time you will,

I would like you to
remove him from the vent.

34:30.989 --> 34:33.907
No, don't. Melanda, please.

34:33.958 --> 34:35.793
Dawn, listen to me.

34:35.827 --> 34:38.661
You just need to give him
a little bit more time.

34:38.696 --> 34:40.464
You owe him that. Just some more time.

34:40.498 --> 34:41.998
That's all he needs.

And I know that your heart...

34:56.898 --> 35:00.384
I can't breathe, Dawn.
Is breaking, but so is mine...

35:00.402 --> 35:00.938
Change your mind.

35:00.981 --> 35:03.386
Because I love him,
and I have always loved him,

35:03.405 --> 35:05.555

let him die with some dignity.
