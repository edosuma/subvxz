01:01.649 --> 01:04.027
<i>(gasps)</i>

01:04.194 --> 01:06.404
<i>(growls)</i>

01:25.173 --> 01:27.258
Major Sheppard.

01:27.926 --> 01:30.011
Major!

03:04.481 --> 03:06.775
<i>(Teyla groans)</i>

03:20.038 --> 03:22.123
<i>(Teyla groans)</i>

03:22.290 --> 03:25.377
- Continue.
- Going easy on me, huh?

03:25.543 --> 03:28.463
I assure you, Major, I am not.
Continue.

03:39.516 --> 03:41.601
You OK?

03:43.228 --> 03:45.730
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

03:45.897 --> 03:48.692
It's usually me
picking my butt up off the mat.

03:48.858 --> 03:51.152
I have not been sleeping much.

03:51.319 --> 03:54.072
I've been having nightmares
about the Wraith.

03:54.239 --> 03:56.866
You're not the only one.

03:57.033 --> 04:01.371
It has not been so bad
since my father was taken.

04:09.671 --> 04:12.048
According to Dr Zelenka's calculations,

04:12.215 --> 04:15.844
we have less than one week
before the Wraith arrive.

04:16.011 --> 04:20.515
- I want options.
- Besides crying ourselves to sleep?

04:20.682 --> 04:22.892
Not me. I haven't slept in days.

04:23.059 --> 04:26.021
What do you have to show
for your sleepless nights?

04:26.187 --> 04:29.858
We've uncovered defensive
weapons systems beyond the shield...

04:30.025 --> 04:33.737
- Our best option is the control chair.
- I was gonna say that.

04:33.903 --> 04:37.449
- You were taking too long.
- It may not be our best chance.

04:37.615 --> 04:41.036
- Gentlemen.
- Power will be our biggest problem.

04:41.202 --> 04:46.124
We haven't initialised the chair yet,
let alone determined if we have the power.

04:46.291 --> 04:48.376
OK. Keep me posted.

04:48.543 --> 04:51.421
Sergeant Bates,
where are we with our Alpha site?

04:51.588 --> 04:55.800
We've completed the security sweep
and are ready to establish base camp.

04:55.967 --> 04:58.178
Awaiting inspection by Major Sheppard.

04:58.345 --> 05:00.889
- Right after lunch.
- Good.

05:01.056 --> 05:03.933
Are the Athosians
prepared for an evacuation?

05:04.100 --> 05:08.188
Yes, but many believe there is
no other world safe from the Wraith.

05:08.355 --> 05:14.152
- They want to stay?
- There are cullings all over the galaxy.

05:14.319 --> 05:16.237
We have spent our lives hiding.

05:16.404 --> 05:20.033
The difference here being
we do intend to destroy the city

05:20.200 --> 05:23.370
rather than let it fall
into the hands of the Wraith.

05:23.536 --> 05:28.249
Anyone left on the mainland
will be cut off from the Stargate for good.

05:28.416 --> 05:31.544
Thanks to Rodney's discovery
of the control crystal,

05:31.711 --> 05:36.132
we can take that with us and hopefully
use it to access Earth in the future.

05:36.299 --> 05:39.135
We understand that, Dr Weir.

05:39.302 --> 05:40.762
I'm sorry...

05:40.929 --> 05:46.309
The people of Athos wish you to know
that they too will help defend the city.

05:46.476 --> 05:49.270
<i>- That is very honourable, but...
- (Kavanagh) Please!</i>

05:49.437 --> 05:51.606
We can't possibly stay and fight.

05:51.773 --> 05:56.111
I disagree. I think it's entirely
within the realm of possibility.

05:56.277 --> 05:59.406
There are tens of thousands
of life-sucking aliens

05:59.572 --> 06:02.617
in advanced spaceships
on their way to destroy us,

06:02.784 --> 06:07.706
and we have 200 people, mostly scientists
who've never even fired a gun before.

06:07.872 --> 06:11.835
Shockingly, for the first time ever,
I have to agree with Kavanagh.

06:12.002 --> 06:15.880
All I'm saying is
let's not give up just yet.

06:16.047 --> 06:20.135
What was that we were supposed
to all remember? Something important.

06:20.301 --> 06:23.722
- The Alamo.
- Granted, you guys are scientists.

06:23.888 --> 06:28.476
No one will put you on the front line,
but science can turn the tide of war.

06:28.643 --> 06:33.231
- Look at the A-bomb.
- Not exactly our proudest moment.

06:33.398 --> 06:39.279
The Wraith aren't here yet, and until then
remain focused on what you do best.

06:39.446 --> 06:43.992
Like I said off the top,
if there are any options, I want them.

06:44.159 --> 06:46.244
That's all.

07:03.261 --> 07:05.138
Teyla?

07:05.305 --> 07:07.307
Hi.

07:07.474 --> 07:09.642
Kate Heightmeyer.

07:09.809 --> 07:12.395
Yes, right. I knew that. I'm sorry.

07:12.562 --> 07:15.190
No problem. Mind if I join you?

07:16.149 --> 07:18.234
No, of course not.

07:19.986 --> 07:23.323
Strange how the memory
just goes away when we're tired.

07:23.490 --> 07:27.160
- You are a doctor, right?
- Psychologist, actually.

07:28.286 --> 07:31.039
And that is different than Dr Beckett?

07:31.790 --> 07:34.209
Quite, yes.

07:34.376 --> 07:36.461
I deal with the mind.

07:36.628 --> 07:38.922
I help people with emotional problems

07:39.089 --> 07:42.759
like anxiety, depression,
post-traumatic distress.

07:42.926 --> 07:46.388
Needless to say,
I've been pretty busy since we got here.

07:46.554 --> 07:48.431
I can imagine.

07:48.598 --> 07:52.894
I'm sure you do a lot of the same things
that I do for your people,

07:53.061 --> 07:57.399
but it must be very hard on you,
always having to keep such a brave face.

07:57.565 --> 07:59.776
From strength comes hope.

07:59.943 --> 08:03.697
Without hope, my people would be lost.

08:03.863 --> 08:08.576
You must feel you have to be
outwardly strong for us as well.

08:09.536 --> 08:14.374
I know that your value and your loyalty
have been questioned by a few in the past.

08:14.541 --> 08:19.254
What I'm trying to say to you is
if you ever need to talk, I'm here.

08:19.421 --> 08:22.007
Did Major Sheppard ask you
to speak with me?

08:22.173 --> 08:24.551
- Yes, he may have...
- I'm sorry.

08:24.718 --> 08:29.264
I do not mean to be rude,
but I'm fine. Really.

08:33.727 --> 08:35.812
I appreciate your concern.

08:49.868 --> 08:52.037
Major.

08:52.203 --> 08:54.706
- Teyla.
- What did you tell Dr Heightmeyer?

08:54.873 --> 08:59.377
What you told me, that you couldn't sleep
because you were having nightmares.

08:59.544 --> 09:04.174
- I confided in you.
- You're in my team, so my responsibility.

09:04.341 --> 09:09.929
And I only told one person, whose job is
to deal exactly with this sort of thing.

09:10.096 --> 09:14.142
- There is nothing wrong with my mind.
- Nobody said there was.

09:14.309 --> 09:18.480
It's hard enough with your people
without them thinking I'm crazy.

09:18.646 --> 09:22.275
- Nobody thinks you're crazy.
- That is not the point.

09:22.442 --> 09:26.571
Look, Teyla,
you may wanna sit this one out.

09:26.738 --> 09:29.866
- What do you mean?
- Rodney's staying back.

09:30.033 --> 09:33.787
Ford and I are gonna check out
the Alpha site before we move in.

09:33.953 --> 09:36.790
My people will be forced
to that planet as well.

09:36.956 --> 09:39.876
And I'll make sure it's safe for everyone.

09:40.043 --> 09:44.255
Look, I'm not saying there's
anything wrong with you, God forbid,

09:44.422 --> 09:47.717
but you admitted that
you were a little off your game.

09:47.884 --> 09:51.054
You snapped at Dr Weir
for no good reason.

09:51.221 --> 09:56.059
Now you're biting my head off for caring
that it's three days since you slept.

09:56.226 --> 09:59.854
I'm sorry, but I do not need any help.

10:00.021 --> 10:02.774
The Wraith are coming.
I need to do something.

10:02.941 --> 10:06.736
OK. Good. I suggest you take a nap.

10:43.023 --> 10:45.275
- Teyla.
- Dr McKay.

10:46.151 --> 10:48.236
I was just...

10:49.863 --> 10:52.198
We're seeing each other.

10:53.867 --> 10:56.745
You and Dr Heightmeyer?

10:58.997 --> 11:02.542
Well, you know how much
I love women with great... minds.

11:02.709 --> 11:05.462
Just don't say anything to anyone.

11:05.628 --> 11:09.799
- Your secret is safe with me.
- Right. Very good. Excellent.

11:15.430 --> 11:18.308
- Dr Heightmeyer?
- Teyla. Come in.

11:18.475 --> 11:20.685
I'm sorry to bother you.

11:20.852 --> 11:24.731
- Is it all right if I...?
- Of course. Please, have a seat.

11:37.202 --> 11:40.580
I guess I'm not really sure
how this is supposed to work.

11:41.831 --> 11:44.876
Just relax.
Tell me whatever's on your mind.

11:48.254 --> 11:50.757
I have been having bad dreams.

11:52.050 --> 11:54.135
I feel...

11:58.723 --> 12:02.143
Everyone is afraid.
I do not know why I'm bothering you...

12:02.310 --> 12:04.688
Could you always sense the Wraith?

12:04.854 --> 12:08.274
Yes. Since I can remember.

12:08.441 --> 12:11.236
What does it feel like?

12:20.328 --> 12:25.625
It feels like a deep cold
that comes from within.

12:27.377 --> 12:30.255
I first felt it when I was a girl.

12:30.422 --> 12:33.675
I could not breathe,
and I did not know why,

12:33.842 --> 12:36.261
and then we heard the darts.

12:36.428 --> 12:39.472
Do you feel that way now?

12:39.639 --> 12:43.852
I have had a knot inside me
for some time now.

12:44.019 --> 12:48.356
As I understand, their ships
are still a great distance from Atlantis.

12:48.523 --> 12:52.277
Can you really sense them
from so far away?

12:52.444 --> 12:57.198
This feeling is a little different
than in the past.

12:57.365 --> 13:00.118
Perhaps it is because
it is always there now.

13:00.285 --> 13:03.663
I am getting used to it.

13:03.830 --> 13:08.043
Never before in my lifetime
have so many Wraith been awake.

13:08.209 --> 13:10.712
Do many of your people have this ability?

13:10.879 --> 13:12.756
Some.

13:12.922 --> 13:17.719
Among those few, some can sense
the Wraith stronger than others.

13:17.886 --> 13:20.597
I am among the first
to know they are coming.

13:20.764 --> 13:24.267
That makes you special.
How does that make you feel?

13:24.434 --> 13:28.021
- I have not given it much thought.
- Why not?

13:28.188 --> 13:31.232
Why do some people
have blue eyes and others brown?

13:36.196 --> 13:38.281
Tell me about your nightmares.

14:22.033 --> 14:24.119
It was me.

14:24.285 --> 14:26.329
You were standing over yourself?

14:26.496 --> 14:30.583
It was me, but it was not me.
I was a Wraith.

14:30.750 --> 14:34.337
People waste a lot of time
trying to interpret their dreams.

14:34.504 --> 14:38.800
They're just another way our brain thinks.
There are no hidden meanings.

14:38.967 --> 14:41.720
We forget most everything
we dream about.

14:41.886 --> 14:45.974
Our conscious mind is capable
of deciding what's most important to us.

14:46.141 --> 14:51.479
The fact that, on some level, I see myself
as a Wraith is very disturbing to me.

14:51.646 --> 14:56.359
I think this special ability you have,
this talent for sensing the Wraith,

14:56.526 --> 14:59.154
connects you to them in your mind,

14:59.320 --> 15:03.074
maybe in a way you would like to deny.

15:03.241 --> 15:07.245
You said you hadn't given it
much thought. I don't think that's true.

15:07.412 --> 15:10.165
What am I supposed to do?
I cannot change it.

15:10.332 --> 15:15.253
Probably not,
but the unknown frightens us.

15:15.420 --> 15:19.090
We all like to feel in control,
even though most of the time

15:19.257 --> 15:22.844
our power over most things
is just an illusion,

15:23.011 --> 15:25.638
but I find the more we know
about something,

15:25.805 --> 15:29.768
the more we can convince ourselves
we are in control of it.

15:32.437 --> 15:35.273
I ran every test I could on all of you.

15:35.440 --> 15:37.942
You and your people
are the same as we are.

15:38.109 --> 15:41.112
I have no explanation
for your special superpowers.

15:41.279 --> 15:44.699
- I only have one.
- I've seen you fight, my dear.

15:46.034 --> 15:49.913
This ability is something that
is passed on through family lineage.

15:50.080 --> 15:53.249
- Does that not make it biological?
- It would seem so.

15:53.416 --> 15:56.294
But without samples
from everyone in your family,

15:56.461 --> 16:02.550
I would have little chance of identifying
what causes the anatomical response.

16:02.717 --> 16:04.803
It'd be difficult.

16:05.804 --> 16:09.474
Any chance you would have time
to fly me over to the mainland?

16:09.641 --> 16:13.353
If you're willing to take your life
into your own hands.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.605
I'd love a break.

16:32.038 --> 16:34.165
You've changed, Teyla.

16:34.332 --> 16:38.461
- My hair is shorter.
- It's more than your hair, dear.

16:38.628 --> 16:43.591
I can still see the little girl
who used to paint me beautiful pictures

16:43.758 --> 16:46.886
while she sang the songs of the Ancients.

16:47.053 --> 16:49.389
I have not been her in a long time, Charin.

16:49.556 --> 16:52.726
No, but even Teyla,
leader of the Athosians,

16:52.892 --> 16:56.604
always found the time
to come and visit with poor old Charin.

16:56.771 --> 16:59.315
I have missed your tuttleroot soup.

16:59.482 --> 17:03.945
But I suspect it's more than my soup
that has brought you here.

17:04.112 --> 17:08.825
You've come to pluck me from my tent
and take me to yet another world.

17:08.992 --> 17:10.492
Not yet,

17:10.660 --> 17:15.623
but it seems we may have to evacuate
again soon, at least temporarily.

17:17.500 --> 17:20.086
Did you allow yourself
to expect differently?

17:20.252 --> 17:25.008
I still believe that we can one day
be free of the Wraith.

17:25.175 --> 17:31.348
You can save such stories for those
whose bones aren't failing them.

17:33.558 --> 17:37.687
Charin, do you know
why I can sense the Wraith coming?

17:37.854 --> 17:42.108
You were born to it. There have been
a few in every generation.

17:42.275 --> 17:46.780
I know, but has no one ever wondered
how that is possible?

17:46.946 --> 17:51.660
Some believe it was a gift
from the Ancestors.

17:51.826 --> 17:53.620
And you?

17:55.580 --> 17:58.958
Your father asked me not to tell you.

18:00.585 --> 18:04.339
My father is not here any more.

18:06.299 --> 18:12.514
No other living Athosian knows of this,
for good reason.

18:14.766 --> 18:17.686
Please, tell me anyway.

18:19.854 --> 18:24.984
My grandfather used to tell a story,

18:25.151 --> 18:28.863
no one has ever heard the like
before or since,

18:29.030 --> 18:33.034
about the few who once returned.

18:34.285 --> 18:37.163
Returned?

18:37.330 --> 18:40.208
There was a planet.

18:40.375 --> 18:43.169
As was expected, every so often,

18:43.336 --> 18:47.007
the Wraith came, villagers were taken.

18:47.173 --> 18:50.510
But there, on this particular planet,

18:50.677 --> 18:56.891
on several occasions,
the taken came back.

19:01.813 --> 19:05.233
<i>Some believed the Ancestors
had returned their loved ones,</i>

19:05.400 --> 19:08.737
that they had been blessed with a gift

19:08.903 --> 19:11.448
that made them unwanted by the Wraith.

19:11.614 --> 19:16.077
Others even told tales of how the taken
had somehow vanquished the Wraith,

19:16.244 --> 19:18.872
but soon the taken began to be feared.

19:19.039 --> 19:22.584
- Why?
- They spoke of hearing voices.

19:22.751 --> 19:25.378
Many began to behave strangely.

19:25.545 --> 19:29.257
Some became violent, even murderous.

19:29.424 --> 19:33.386
Well, it doesn't sound like
the Ancients were responsible for that.

19:33.553 --> 19:36.598
The villagers turned on the taken.
It was a massacre.

19:36.765 --> 19:41.269
All but a few were killed.
The rest were ostracised and sent away.

19:41.436 --> 19:46.024
After that, no others that were taken
from that village ever returned again,

19:46.191 --> 19:48.651
but those few who survived,

19:48.818 --> 19:54.032
they are the ones
who Charin believes passed on the gift.

19:54.199 --> 19:58.453
- And one of the taken that survived was...
- My lineage.

19:58.620 --> 20:01.247
I have the address to the planet.

20:01.414 --> 20:05.669
Charin says the village is long gone.
All that is left are ruins.

20:05.835 --> 20:09.839
- Still I wish to go there.
- Now?

20:10.006 --> 20:14.260
I believe this must be
coming to light now for a reason.

20:14.427 --> 20:17.597
Maybe we can find evidence
of what really happened.

20:17.764 --> 20:20.517
There are a lot of things
we need to get done.

20:20.684 --> 20:24.521
Maybe there is a way to fight the Wraith
we have yet to discover.

20:24.688 --> 20:28.858
Perhaps my ancestors
were simply not enlightened enough

20:29.025 --> 20:32.237
to recognise their gift for what it was.

20:35.490 --> 20:38.076
Doesn't hurt to take a look around.

20:48.169 --> 20:50.797
- Sir, there's nothing here.
- I know.

20:50.964 --> 20:55.135
- It's dark. Shouldn't we be getting back?
- Just give her a minute.

20:55.301 --> 20:58.555
- Sir...
- I need her to put this behind her, sleep.

20:58.722 --> 21:01.516
We all do, so whatever it takes.

21:05.812 --> 21:08.398
- Rodney?
- I've got something here.

21:08.565 --> 21:10.984
- Really?
- I don't know.

21:11.151 --> 21:13.778
I've got a little...

21:15.196 --> 21:19.367
You've got a little what?
Hey, McKay, you've got a little what?

21:21.202 --> 21:23.121
What?

21:25.081 --> 21:28.501
- It's OK when you guys make fun of me.
- Rodney?

21:28.668 --> 21:33.923
Picking up a faint energy signal.
It's getting stronger.

21:34.090 --> 21:37.052
- It's coming from here.
- There's nothing here.

21:37.969 --> 21:42.265
- The magic Ancient device hasn't lied yet.
- It's solid.

21:42.432 --> 21:46.019
- There's definitely something weird here.
- Weird how?

21:47.103 --> 21:50.482
- How about that?
- Teyla! Teyla!

21:51.566 --> 21:55.320
Maybe if you got a good running start,
really slam into it.

22:01.826 --> 22:04.120
- How'd you do that?
- I do not know.

22:04.287 --> 22:07.374
I was just looking for a way out.

22:17.884 --> 22:23.098
- Looks like the inside of a Wraith ship.
- What the hell were they doing here?

22:37.487 --> 22:39.948
- Rodney.
- Elizabeth.

22:40.115 --> 22:42.242
You found a Wraith laboratory?

22:42.409 --> 22:45.453
Looks that way.
Some sort of hidden secret facility.

22:45.620 --> 22:49.416
It's obviously been abandoned
for a very long time.

22:49.582 --> 22:53.628
I pulled this data recorder
from one of the computer consoles.

22:53.795 --> 22:56.464
The Wraith were experimenting
on the people?

22:56.631 --> 23:00.010
- No idea. Hoping this will tell us.
- Why the secrecy?

23:00.176 --> 23:05.724
The Wraith can take people at will
and do whatever they want with them.

23:05.890 --> 23:08.226
Here we go.

23:10.145 --> 23:11.521
There.

23:11.688 --> 23:15.942
Now... that means
absolutely nothing to me.

23:16.109 --> 23:20.822
Last time I saw one of these, it showed
a galactic positioning system for ships.

23:20.989 --> 23:24.701
- More pictures than symbols.
- I wonder...

23:26.453 --> 23:29.873
Just so you know, you didn't
finish that sentence out loud.

23:30.040 --> 23:33.543
- Well, this is obviously a language.
- Wraith language?

23:33.710 --> 23:37.380
That would make sense.
I'd love to have a look through this.

23:37.547 --> 23:41.801
Knock yourself out. I gotta get back
to the control chair anyway.

23:47.057 --> 23:50.852
- Why could only you access the doorway?
- I don't know.

23:51.019 --> 23:53.521
Only a Wraith can enter a Wraith facility?

23:53.688 --> 23:59.069
- I'm not a Wraith.
- What does it feel like to be a Wraith?

23:59.235 --> 24:01.446
I feel hungry.

24:03.406 --> 24:05.575
<i>(gasps)</i>

24:12.791 --> 24:15.460
Remember what happened
last time I sat in one?

24:15.627 --> 24:19.798
- There's nowhere near enough power.
- Then why bother? It's quite late.

24:19.964 --> 24:25.261
We are trying to determine how much
power is required to operate the systems.

24:25.428 --> 24:28.473
- And it needs to be on.
- You have the gene now.

24:28.640 --> 24:32.394
I can't analyse the data
while keeping the damn thing activated.

24:32.560 --> 24:35.063
- You analyse it.
- Rodney doesn't think...

24:35.230 --> 24:37.982
- Gentlemen, how's it coming?
- Well, not good.

24:38.149 --> 24:41.319
- This won't help. Carson, I need you.
- Thank God.

24:41.486 --> 24:43.697
- We're using him.
- Is someone hurt?

24:43.863 --> 24:45.907
- You were right.
- Lovely. About what?

24:46.074 --> 24:50.912
Your theory of the Wraith evolving
after the Ancients arrived in Pegasus.

24:51.079 --> 24:53.456
- Pay up.
- How do you know?

24:53.623 --> 24:57.127
- Wraith language is derived from Ancient.
- That doesn't...

24:57.293 --> 25:01.256
Rodney, please.
That's not why I need to see you.

25:01.423 --> 25:04.592
I've been able to translate
the first part of the log.

25:04.759 --> 25:06.845
Really?

25:09.931 --> 25:12.809
- We'll try Dr Kusanagi again. Now.
- OK.

25:12.976 --> 25:14.936
Thank you.

25:23.945 --> 25:28.283
Good morning. You look like I feel.

25:30.201 --> 25:33.204
Well, we've been up all night.

25:33.371 --> 25:35.832
You wanted to see me?

25:35.999 --> 25:38.626
- You'd better sit down.
- What is it?

25:41.963 --> 25:46.134
Well, I translated the first part
of the log you brought back and...

25:46.301 --> 25:49.888
Are you sure
you don't wanna have a seat?

25:52.265 --> 25:55.810
The Wraith were conducting experiments
on your ancestors.

25:55.977 --> 25:58.188
It was just one Wraith, actually.

25:58.355 --> 26:02.192
He was doing it against the wishes
of the other Wraith, in secret.

26:02.359 --> 26:04.819
What was he doing?

26:04.986 --> 26:07.697
I think he was trying
to make their food source

26:07.864 --> 26:09.949
more compatible with their species.

26:10.116 --> 26:13.870
- I do not understand.
- It was very easy to miss.

26:14.037 --> 26:18.541
I couldn't even make the comparison
necessary to isolate the specific strand.

26:18.708 --> 26:21.127
We needed Wraith cells, which we got,

26:21.294 --> 26:25.298
but also a mapping of the genetic
code which wasn't 50% complete...

26:25.465 --> 26:27.926
Please.

26:28.093 --> 26:30.929
Tell me.

26:31.096 --> 26:35.016
You have some Wraith DNA
in your genetic make-up.

26:39.020 --> 26:42.232
- Teyla is part Wraith?
- A very small part.

26:42.399 --> 26:46.236
She's as different from us as you
because of your Ancient gene.

26:46.403 --> 26:49.614
- And some other things.
- Bates is gonna go nuts.

26:49.781 --> 26:54.452
- Let's keep this one under our hat.
- Teyla is concerned how we will react.

26:54.619 --> 26:59.040
You think this Wraith scientist
was trying to make humans more tasty?

26:59.207 --> 27:03.461
The log indicates that he wanted
to make the feeding more efficient.

27:03.628 --> 27:07.382
You said they had genetic characteristics
similar to humans.

27:07.549 --> 27:12.595
They do, but they're still closer to the bug
that attacked Major Sheppard than us.

27:12.762 --> 27:15.598
- We weren't gonna mention that again.
- Sorry.

27:15.765 --> 27:18.852
Also interesting is the fact
that the Wraith language

27:19.019 --> 27:21.312
appears to be a derivative of Ancient,

27:21.479 --> 27:25.984
which suggests that the Wraith evolved
after the Ancients arrived in Pegasus.

27:26.151 --> 27:33.033
The Ancients unwittingly allowed humans
to evolve on a planet with insects on it.

27:33.199 --> 27:38.288
At some point, the insects fed on humans
and incorporated our DNA into theirs.

27:38.455 --> 27:40.623
The Wraith are an evolution of that.

27:40.790 --> 27:44.461
So you're saying the Ancients
actually created the Wraith?

27:44.627 --> 27:46.880
- By accident.
- Or negligence.

27:47.047 --> 27:48.423
It doesn't matter.

27:48.590 --> 27:50.967
The more we know
about Wraith physiology,

27:51.134 --> 27:55.013
the closer we get to a weapon that can
attack them and leave us unharmed.

27:55.180 --> 28:00.393
Yes, but all we know is that the Ancients
might have created the Wraith,

28:00.560 --> 28:03.146
and why Teyla can sense them coming.

28:03.313 --> 28:07.525
Fabulous, mystery solved,
but that doesn't stop them from coming.

28:07.692 --> 28:11.112
Rodney's right. Let's get back to work.

28:11.863 --> 28:13.948
Thank you.

28:16.159 --> 28:19.329
I know it is not my fault.
There's nothing I can do.

28:19.496 --> 28:24.084
The fact is, I'm really no different now
than I was yesterday or last week.

28:24.250 --> 28:26.419
But you feel different.

28:26.586 --> 28:28.672
Yes.

28:30.131 --> 28:36.179
The thing that I am most worried about
is how people will perceive me.

28:36.346 --> 28:41.476
My father told people that it was a gift,
I was special, but in a good way.

28:41.643 --> 28:45.939
I could help my people by warning them
of the Wraith's approach.

28:46.106 --> 28:51.820
He did it to protect me, but I think that it is
why they first turned to me as a leader.

28:51.986 --> 28:55.407
As you said, you're no different
than you were yesterday.

28:55.573 --> 28:59.202
Yes, but now they have reason
to fear me.

29:03.581 --> 29:07.544
Even with Major Sheppard in the chair,
we weren't able to...

29:07.711 --> 29:09.671
What? What is that?

29:12.674 --> 29:15.802
Something you said made me wonder...

29:16.761 --> 29:20.890
- There are more important...
- Why did that Wraith stop experimenting?

29:21.057 --> 29:24.144
- What did I say?
- I don't remember.

29:24.310 --> 29:28.356
It's a good point. I'm just wondering
what I said. What have you got?

29:28.523 --> 29:30.984
At first I thought
the other Wraith caught him.

29:31.151 --> 29:33.611
- They didn't?
- He stopped on his own.

29:33.778 --> 29:37.115
Why didn't the Wraith want
these experiments taking place?

29:37.282 --> 29:41.703
- Exactly.
- They were intended to improve things.

29:41.870 --> 29:43.496
- That's it.
- I just said it.

29:43.663 --> 29:46.875
<i>- Will you stop?
- (Weir) Here's the most interesting part.</i>

29:47.042 --> 29:50.462
The Wraith communicate
using a telepathic network.

29:50.628 --> 29:52.297
I noticed that.

29:52.464 --> 29:57.177
Thankfully, they can't seem to read
the minds of humans, though.

29:57.344 --> 30:00.430
What does this have to do
with the experiments?

30:00.597 --> 30:04.225
By combining even small amounts
of Wraith DNA with humans,

30:04.392 --> 30:07.937
the scientist was giving the humans
Wraith mental abilities.

30:08.104 --> 30:12.275
The subjects of his experiments
could hear the Wraith communications.

30:12.442 --> 30:15.278
The voices that the people heard were...

30:15.445 --> 30:19.741
Were Wraith. Exactly.
It must have driven them mad.

30:19.908 --> 30:23.995
The Wraith scientist couldn't find
a way around it, so he gave up.

30:24.162 --> 30:26.915
Why let them back
into the general population?

30:27.082 --> 30:32.337
He thought that interbreeding with
normal humans might dilute the effect.

30:32.504 --> 30:34.714
Before he realised, it was too late.

30:34.881 --> 30:38.009
When the other Wraith did find out
what he had done,

30:38.176 --> 30:41.304
they wiped out all the people on the planet.

30:41.971 --> 30:46.559
But not before several test subjects
had been ostracised and forced to leave.

30:46.726 --> 30:48.228
How does this help us?

30:48.395 --> 30:53.525
Teyla may have more than just the ability
to sense the Wraith coming.

30:53.692 --> 30:58.196
You think Teyla might be able
to tap into this Wraith psychic network?

30:58.363 --> 31:03.368
If she can, we'll be able to gather
all the intel we ever needed about them.

31:10.750 --> 31:14.087
I have never been able to hear
the thoughts of the Wraith.

31:14.254 --> 31:18.675
According to the notes, those who were
given the Wraith DNA had the ability.

31:18.842 --> 31:21.386
You've never actually tried before.

31:21.553 --> 31:26.224
You didn't know you could read
Wraith minds. Who would want to?

31:28.852 --> 31:31.855
I would not even consider
asking you to do this

31:32.022 --> 31:35.734
if I didn't think it could provide us
with vital information.

31:35.900 --> 31:38.528
I just do not know what to do.

31:38.695 --> 31:40.822
Dr Heightmeyer has a theory.

31:40.989 --> 31:44.367
I think it's possible
that through several generations,

31:44.534 --> 31:47.162
people have developed a mental barrier

31:47.329 --> 31:51.374
to the thought projections of the Wraith,
a self-defence mechanism.

31:51.541 --> 31:53.793
- If we can get past that...
- How?

31:53.960 --> 31:56.296
We have a process called hypnosis.

31:56.463 --> 31:58.548
Dr Heightmeyer can lead you through it

31:58.715 --> 32:03.136
and Dr Beckett will remain on hand
at all times to monitor your physiology.

32:03.303 --> 32:05.847
The Wraith are far away, are they not?

32:06.014 --> 32:10.018
Yes, and McKay has some doubts
about the range of this telepathy.

32:10.185 --> 32:13.021
But, as you said,
you can sense the Wraith now.

32:13.188 --> 32:16.775
If that's a bleed-through effect
of a greater latent ability,

32:16.941 --> 32:19.861
then it may be worth
trying to break the barrier.

32:20.028 --> 32:23.657
It's not something
I would ever recommend doing

32:23.823 --> 32:26.368
under any other circumstances.

32:26.534 --> 32:30.664
But these are far from normal
circumstances that we're in, Teyla.

32:30.830 --> 32:36.419
If I can somehow provide us with
something, their strategy, a weakness...

32:36.586 --> 32:39.381
...I see no other choice.

32:47.138 --> 32:49.224
OK, I think we're ready.

32:49.391 --> 32:51.768
Are you?

32:51.935 --> 32:54.479
OK, I want you to breathe...

32:54.646 --> 32:57.065
...nice and deeply, and try to relax.

32:57.232 --> 33:00.110
Dr Beckett's going to administer
a mild sedative.

33:00.276 --> 33:03.405
We should still be able to communicate.

33:03.571 --> 33:07.492
We can wake you at any time
using a low-grade electrical current.

33:07.659 --> 33:12.455
It won't hurt at all.
Just say "out" and we'll end it.

33:13.331 --> 33:15.625
Now, focus on this light as I speak.

33:17.460 --> 33:22.382
The feeling you get from the Wraith
is a cold, dark feeling deep inside you.

33:22.549 --> 33:24.843
I want you to think about that.

33:25.010 --> 33:27.345
Look for it in your mind.

33:27.512 --> 33:29.931
Now, close your eyes and listen to it.

33:30.098 --> 33:32.434
Don't resist.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.103
Go to that place where it lives.

33:43.069 --> 33:45.071
What do you hear?

33:47.866 --> 33:49.951
Nothing.

33:51.703 --> 33:54.331
Your father was taken by the Wraith.

33:54.497 --> 33:57.125
Do you remember sensing it that day?

33:57.292 --> 34:01.087
- Yes.
- Think back to that feeling.

34:01.713 --> 34:03.798
Now listen.

34:04.883 --> 34:07.761
What do you hear?

34:07.927 --> 34:09.429
Noise.

34:09.596 --> 34:12.556
Voices, so many voices, whispering.

34:12.724 --> 34:15.935
Listen closely. Listen for one.

34:19.647 --> 34:22.359
- I can see.
- Tell us what you see, Teyla.

34:22.525 --> 34:25.737
I am on a ship.

34:25.904 --> 34:28.864
- I am walking.
- She can see what's happening?

34:29.032 --> 34:32.369
The Wraith's thoughts
may include what they're seeing.

34:32.534 --> 34:36.206
There are other Wraith,
and they do not notice me.

34:37.540 --> 34:42.795
I am in a room full of people being
preserved so that they can be fed upon.

34:45.590 --> 34:47.676
Aargh!

34:47.842 --> 34:51.304
I am feeding. I am killing him!

34:52.179 --> 34:55.350
Stop. Beckett, stop.

34:55.516 --> 34:59.521
It's OK. It's OK. You're here, in Atlantis.

34:59.688 --> 35:03.525
Teyla, I... I had no right
to ask you to do this.

35:07.028 --> 35:10.991
- Get these things off of me.
- Settle down. I have to take this off.

35:11.157 --> 35:14.202
I can't put her through this.
It's too much to ask.

35:14.369 --> 35:18.206
You might feel differently
once the hive ships show up.

35:18.373 --> 35:20.834
- Why did you make them stop?
- Excuse me?

35:21.001 --> 35:23.503
I was on one of the hive ships
headed here.

35:23.670 --> 35:27.215
I could hear them. I could see.
It was working.

35:27.382 --> 35:30.677
- You were watching them feed.
- Yes.

35:30.844 --> 35:33.972
I actually felt one of them feed,
but I can handle it.

35:34.139 --> 35:36.850
- I can help us.
- I never should've...

35:37.017 --> 35:39.185
I am going to try again.

35:50.280 --> 35:53.199
I am walking through the ship.

35:56.995 --> 35:59.914
<i>I am in some sort of control room.</i>

36:00.707 --> 36:04.002
<i>(breathes deeply)</i>

36:04.961 --> 36:06.713
Er...

36:17.599 --> 36:19.684
You are all so pathetic.

36:22.062 --> 36:24.898
Something tells me
that's not Teyla talking.

36:25.065 --> 36:27.525
Nothing can stop us.

36:27.692 --> 36:29.569
Wake her up.

36:31.863 --> 36:34.032
- You are all going to die.
- Now!

36:34.824 --> 36:37.202
<i>(gasps)</i>

36:45.251 --> 36:47.962
What happened?

36:51.633 --> 36:53.718
Dr Beckett has her sedated.

36:53.885 --> 36:57.597
I would like some time
to let what she's been through sink in.

36:57.764 --> 37:02.227
She may be in shock. I have no idea
what the long-term effect will be.

37:02.394 --> 37:05.939
She said she could see
some type of control room.

37:06.106 --> 37:09.359
- She just needs to get a better look.
- You were there.

37:09.526 --> 37:11.778
A Wraith had control of her.

37:11.945 --> 37:14.072
<i>(alarm)</i>

37:16.658 --> 37:18.743
Incoming wormhole.

37:25.041 --> 37:27.669
Sergeant Bates' IDC. It's the Alpha site.

37:27.836 --> 37:30.880
<i>This is Sergeant Bates. Code red.
We're under attack!</i>

37:31.047 --> 37:33.133
Lower the shields.

37:42.392 --> 37:44.894
Move it, move it!

37:46.146 --> 37:48.857
- That's it, we're clear!
- Raise the shield!

37:51.735 --> 37:53.945
Is everybody OK?

37:54.112 --> 37:56.865
All off-world personnel accounted for.

37:57.032 --> 37:58.992
That planet isn't safe any more.

37:59.159 --> 38:02.620
They dropped a device by the gate
as we were leaving.

38:02.787 --> 38:04.664
They're tagging the planet.

38:04.831 --> 38:07.334
If we evacuate,
we need a new place to go.

38:07.500 --> 38:10.086
It was uninhabited.
Why did the Wraith want it?

38:10.253 --> 38:14.007
I don't know.
It's almost like they knew we were there.

38:19.137 --> 38:24.434
I was close. I was so close.
I really think if I had another chance...

38:24.601 --> 38:26.686
You don't have to prove anything.

38:26.853 --> 38:30.190
I think this could make a difference.
I saw a hologram.

38:30.357 --> 38:32.942
I think it was a map, maybe a battle plan.

38:33.109 --> 38:35.445
Their battle plan is to wipe us out.

38:35.612 --> 38:39.240
I'm not so sure that is true.
They want something from us.

38:39.407 --> 38:43.161
- Yeah, they wanna eat us.
- No, something more.

38:43.328 --> 38:45.413
- They are desperate.
- Really?

38:45.580 --> 38:47.457
Yes, it is surprising.

38:47.624 --> 38:50.877
They are confident
in their dominance over us,

38:51.044 --> 38:53.630
but mainly because
there are so many of them;

38:53.797 --> 38:55.924
too many to sustain for long.

38:56.091 --> 39:00.762
They have all awakened early and
there is not enough food to go around.

39:00.929 --> 39:05.016
It was just a feeling.
The voices were so hard to separate.

39:05.183 --> 39:07.686
You don't remember
one speaking through you?

39:07.852 --> 39:11.940
No, but I remember
the feeling just before it happened.

39:12.107 --> 39:15.360
- Next time...
- Dr Weir won't let there be a next time.

39:21.908 --> 39:26.705
If that's true, chances are it was Teyla
who gave away our location to the Wraith.

39:26.871 --> 39:30.125
- There wasn't time.
- Maybe they had a ship in the area.

39:30.291 --> 39:34.546
I admit asking Teyla to connect
with the Wraith may have been a mistake.

39:34.713 --> 39:37.173
With respect, there's no doubt about that.

39:37.340 --> 39:41.845
Take it easy, Sergeant. It's not like
she wilfully gave away our position.

39:42.012 --> 39:44.597
She wants to try again.

39:44.764 --> 39:48.435
She was close to something big
she's convinced we need to know.

39:48.601 --> 39:52.772
I'm sorry. I'm not sure Teyla's
thinking about what's best for herself.

39:52.939 --> 39:54.858
She could compromise us further.

39:55.025 --> 39:58.361
We have more to gain from the Wraith
than they do from us.

39:58.528 --> 40:02.615
She wants to do it. There may be
nothing we can do to stop her trying,

40:02.782 --> 40:06.870
so isn't it better if we're all there?

40:11.541 --> 40:14.961
OK. Close your eyes and relax

40:15.128 --> 40:17.630
and listen for the voices.

40:35.940 --> 40:37.400
<i>(growls)</i>

40:37.567 --> 40:39.903
Teyla?

40:40.070 --> 40:42.364
- Break the connection.
- It's not working.

40:42.530 --> 40:45.784
- No!
- Teyla!

41:24.197 --> 41:27.283
<i>(Weir) I hope we haven't caused her
psychological damage.</i>

41:27.450 --> 41:32.455
Teyla's strong. She's been able to hold it
together after what she's been through.

41:33.498 --> 41:36.376
There you are. Major, Dr Weir.

41:36.543 --> 41:38.461
Carson, how are you feeling?

41:38.628 --> 41:40.964
Doozy of a headache, but I'll be fine.

41:41.131 --> 41:44.342
Teyla's awake.
She wants to see both of you.

41:49.973 --> 41:52.058
Teyla, can I get you some water?

41:52.225 --> 41:55.854
No. I am so sorry.

41:56.021 --> 41:59.816
- I thought I could prevent...
- It's all right. Everyone's fine.

41:59.983 --> 42:02.652
We are concerned
the Wraith can connect at will.

42:02.819 --> 42:05.488
It has never happened before.

42:05.655 --> 42:09.617
No, I am sure
I have to connect with them first.

42:10.452 --> 42:14.873
I saw their plans, the route
their ships are taking to get here.

42:15.040 --> 42:17.292
<i>- That's good.
- (Teyla) There's more.</i>

42:17.459 --> 42:20.420
They do not just want Atlantis.

42:20.587 --> 42:23.548
- They know about you.
- What do you mean?

42:23.715 --> 42:27.552
Sumner. The female Wraith
wasn't just feeding on him.

42:27.719 --> 42:31.890
- She was interrogating him.
- That is why they're all waking up.

42:32.057 --> 42:34.392
That is why they are coming here.

42:34.559 --> 42:39.356
They know that Atlantis is the only way
to get to a new, rich feeding ground.

42:41.399 --> 42:42.776
Earth.
