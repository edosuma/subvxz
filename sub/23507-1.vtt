00:36.953 --> 00:45.422
English Subitles

01:11.693 --> 01:14.959
Our planet is a blue planet,

01:17.503 --> 01:23.415
Deep Blue water dwarfing
the patches of land we call earth.

01:27.658 --> 01:31.921
Deep Blue- the source of life itself.

04:35.832 --> 04:42.599
Here, half a million albatross jostle for space to breed
on a tiny island in the Southern Ocean.

06:22.807 --> 06:29.557
After thousand of miles of searching,
at last the deep blue offers it's bounty.

06:52.458 --> 06:55.624
The Ocean sustains far more life
then all of the land,

06:56.691 --> 07:01.642
but it is unevenly spread
hiding and shifting in blue space.

07:22.475 --> 07:28.889
Gathering seabirds betray a discovery.
The fish shoals have broken their cover.

10:50.660 --> 10:52.749
This is a world of constant jeoparedy,

10:53.372 --> 10:56.734
An endless cycle of birth death and renewal.

11:21.893 --> 11:25.625
For a new generation of sea lions,
life begins at the coast.

11:26.156 --> 11:30.325
A place of saftey to which
their mothers return only to give birth.

11:53.735 --> 11:56.199
The unfamiliar land becomes
a gentle nursery,

11:56.856 --> 12:02.578
A place where the young pups gather strength
as they grow in readyness for a harsher life at sea.

15:22.879 --> 15:26.912
Killer whales have only a few days
to take advantage of the naive young pups.

15:27.468 --> 15:30.842
Soon the sea lions will learn to avoid
the shalows of high tide.

15:34.085 --> 15:38.311
Meanwhile, the whales risk being stranded
on the shore as they take their prey.

15:54.387 --> 15:58.612
It's a dangerous business and the young
killers must be taught to hunt in open water

15:59.008 --> 16:00.864
Before they can risk the shore.

17:35.029 --> 17:38.856
At the coastline, the earth and sea meet
to form a borderland,

17:39.912 --> 17:42.919
A world of tension
where moods shift with the tides.

20:20.640 --> 20:27.900
Away from the coastline in the bright warm water,
a tiny portion of the Ocean holds its greatest riches.

20:29.957 --> 20:38.392
The coral reefs, a narrow band of sun fed life
only found in the shallows of tropical seas.

21:22.765 --> 21:27.032
This is a fragile world
built upon the smallest of organisms,

21:27.594 --> 21:34.863
The coral polyps whose skeletons form the reef,
colonies that may strech for hundred of miles.

23:16.309 --> 23:19.936
A gentle whale shark,
the largest fish in the sea,

23:20.753 --> 23:26.595
visits the reef during the green of a plankton bloom,
sifting the water through its gills.

24:13.671 --> 24:16.377
The moon has a powerful force upon the deep.

24:17.287 --> 24:22.138
Her ghostly realm is a different world,
when new rules apply.

25:07.554 --> 25:11.904
Rooted to the spot, even the coral
must fight a wall for territoty.

25:12.684 --> 25:17.550
shooting out deadly stinging cells to paralyse
and then eat their neighbours alive.

25:58.711 --> 26:00.348
The darkness brings it's own mood,

26:01.034 --> 26:06.092
A change of rhytm where the creatures of
the light must find a hiding place.

26:21.018 --> 26:24.570
A crevice under a coral head,
will provide shelter for the night,

26:25.688 --> 26:28.131
but no certainty that you will see the dawn.

26:32.364 --> 26:34.886
For others,
the darkness is feeding time.

27:18.418 --> 27:20.254
The night feeders have no need of light

27:21.080 --> 27:24.488
Special sensors allow them to
detect the slightest movement.

27:28.106 --> 27:31.875
Even the smallest electical twich
of muscle bring them close...

27:34.430 --> 27:36.343
...Ready to choose their victim.

31:52.995 --> 31:58.984
Storm and rain and wind and cloud
churn the seas with their own power.

32:20.798 --> 32:27.244
The violent mixing of the waters brings life awakend
and fuelled by light from the sun.

33:34.375 --> 33:37.461
Underwater currents mix and blend
the liquid world,

33:38.170 --> 33:43.892
Whipping up the nourishing swarms of tiny
organisms on which so many other animals feed.

35:54.377 --> 35:56.773
The boneless creatures
have their place too,

35:57.327 --> 36:00.250
trailing their tentacles behind their pusling forms,

36:01.050 --> 36:03.723
Capturing their own pray as they drift.

40:41.466 --> 40:44.068
At the ends of the earth,
north and south,

40:44.742 --> 40:48.232
The frosen Oceans wait
for the return of the sun,

40:48.912 --> 40:52.393
the force that draws life
from the still waters.

41:51.901 --> 41:57.431
Polar bears, no longer safe on firm ice,
are forced to take to the water.

42:48.282 --> 42:53.221
In the far south , Emperor penguins gather
in vast numbers at the ice edge.

42:54.226 --> 42:58.638
They are sleek and fast, ready to face
the harshest weather conditions on earth.

44:29.778 --> 44:33.876
As the Antarctic summer ends,
almost all life heads to the north,

44:34.538 --> 44:39.306
Away from the freezing waters,
but still the Emperor penguins remain.

44:48.318 --> 44:50.674
They face a long and arduous journey south,

44:51.428 --> 44:55.526
100 Miles across the frozen
wasteland, to breed.

45:03.534 --> 45:09.198
For three months, the male birds will starve
enduring temperatures of -70 degrees

45:09.796 --> 45:12.387
and 100 mile an hour winds.

45:55.745 --> 45:59.259
In the Arctic, whinter turns liquid sea
into solid ground,

46:00.237 --> 46:02.781
and for the first time since
summer melted the ice,

46:03.345 --> 46:06.305
the polar bears can move across
the Ocean with ease.

46:09.765 --> 46:14.898
After months of near starvation,
the bears are on a desperate search for food,

46:15.755 --> 46:18.302
and a new generation must learn to hunt.

46:22.719 --> 46:28.386
They scour their frozen world for signs
of nesting seals hidden in ice caves.

47:35.020 --> 47:38.343
The freezing sea brings danger
as well as opportunity.

47:39.179 --> 47:43.329
Locked under a sheet of winter ice,
these Beluga whales are trapped.

47:44.556 --> 47:49.115
It will be many weeks before the ice opens up
and they can swim to clear water.

47:57.902 --> 48:01.843
For now, they are forced to share
this tiny breathing space,

48:02.413 --> 48:06.198
surfacing to snatch air and
battling to keep the ice away.

49:49.825 --> 49:53.375
This time the bear fails,
but the Belugas will keep

50:19.731 --> 50:24.081
the scars of the hunters claws on their
arching, streamlined backs.

50:32.074 --> 50:37.500
Those that survive their icy prison will eventually
return to the freedom of the open seas.

51:30.775 --> 51:33.682
The warming sun once again
chases away the ice,

51:34.456 --> 51:39.750
and Gray whales travel 6000 miles
to gorge in the polar seas.

51:58.404 --> 52:01.518
this three month old baby is
new to the open sea,

52:02.201 --> 52:06.585
and the mother Grey whale must swim slowly
as she guides it to the feeding grounds.

52:44.891 --> 52:47.698
Wary of the 30 ton mother,
who is twice their size,

52:48.302 --> 52:50.733
the hunters target the vulnerable calf.

53:57.323 --> 54:01.790
After hours of harrying by the killers,
the baby whale is exhausted.

54:05.670 --> 54:07.973
Now the hunters try to push
him away from his mother.

54:19.519 --> 54:21.010
They try to drown him.

56:03.330 --> 56:04.610
The calf is dead.

56:07.636 --> 56:12.453
Six hours after the chase began,
the killers finally have their prize.

56:21.432 --> 56:25.738
The mother, bereft of the baby she carried
in her womb for 30 months,

56:26.652 --> 56:28.886
must continue her jorney alone.

56:51.439 --> 56:56.205
The killers have taken only the tongue
and lower jaw of the baby whale.

57:33.263 --> 57:36.822
Away from all land,
the open Ocean,

57:37.611 --> 57:42.763
an endless expance of blue,
a vast watery desert.

58:52.809 --> 59:00.596
Here, wandering giants travel thousands of miles
on the oceanic currents in search of food.

59:53.563 --> 59:56.752
A lonely traveller in liquid space.

01:00:29.839 --> 01:00:32.565
In just a few secret places in the blue,

01:00:33.568 --> 01:00:38.438
normally solitary wanderers come together
in great gatherings.

01:05:37.097 --> 01:05:42.222
Amid the fury, a 30 ton
giant rises from the blue.

01:06:59.762 --> 01:07:03.359
Leave the narrow strip of rich sunlit waters
of the ocean surface,

01:07:04.198 --> 01:07:07.209
and jurney downwards into perpetual night.

01:07:27.218 --> 01:07:31.835
With each sinking meter pressure builds,
the temperature falls,

01:07:31.939 --> 01:07:35.602
all light from the surface fades.

01:07:40.943 --> 01:07:44.196
More men have been into space
then have visited the depest riches

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:46.136
of this alien world.

01:10:58.074 --> 01:11:02.280
Go deeper and life under preasure adapts, changes

01:11:03.389 --> 01:11:06.530
ready to play a deadly game
of hide and seek.

01:12:01.393 --> 01:12:06.272
Down here, the only light comes from
the inhabitants of the deep themselfs.

01:12:07.104 --> 01:12:09.747
Some use it as a lure to attract prey.

01:12:24.967 --> 01:12:31.311
For others the light is a decoy
flashes wich dazzle and confuse their hunters.

01:13:45.321 --> 01:13:48.856
The deep ocean floor is by far
the largest habitat on earth,

01:13:49.496 --> 01:13:52.067
Covering more then a half of all the sea bed.

01:13:52.599 --> 01:13:56.792
Here, the presure is 500 times
greater then at the surface.

01:14:06.312 --> 01:14:10.244
It is mostly flat, but here and there
it is scarred by massive wounds.

01:14:13.944 --> 01:14:16.725
The oceans' depest reach,
the Marianas trench,

01:14:17.307 --> 01:14:20.351
plummets seven miles down
towards the earths core.

01:14:45.339 --> 01:14:49.443
The mid-ecean ridges are the largest
geological structures on earth.

01:14:57.197 --> 01:15:00.164
They stretch 30,000 miles.

01:16:10.753 --> 01:16:16.733
Water, hot as molted lead, gushes from chimneys
as high as 16 storey buildings.

01:16:25.577 --> 01:16:26.946
The Black Smokers

01:16:27.796 --> 01:16:34.605
Highly poisonous hydrogen sulphide billows
into the water creating biological hell.

01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:57.502
And yet, even here, there is life
in enormous quantities.

01:17:07.824 --> 01:17:12.137
These chimneys are some of the most
densely inhabited spots on earth,

01:17:13.437 --> 01:17:17.366
pillars of life where animals exist
without energy from the sun.

01:18:22.518 --> 01:18:27.147
Every single night, life without number
emerges from the deep.

01:18:28.039 --> 01:18:30.287
They come to feed in the reach surface water,

01:18:31.095 --> 01:18:35.444
A daily ritual which is the greatest
biological migration on the planet.

01:20:45.326 --> 01:20:50.603
We have sought out the stars and our moon
without getting to know the deep.

01:20:51.919 --> 01:20:55.109
Yet it is the ocean
that continues to surprise us.

01:24:24.884 --> 01:24:28.535
So far, we have explored only
a tiny fraction of the deep,

01:24:29.491 --> 01:24:32.325
home to the largest creature
that has ever existed.

01:24:50.165 --> 01:24:53.669
There were once 300,000 blue whales
in our oceans,

01:24:57.513 --> 01:25:01.870
Now just 1% of these glorios animals remain,

01:25:06.846 --> 01:25:10.100
and yet we continue to plunder their secret world.
