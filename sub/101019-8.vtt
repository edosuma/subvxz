12:13.483 --> 12:18.071
So if he takes it, then I'll be
moving to California over winter break.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.698
‐ California...

12:19.698 --> 12:23.202
‐ So, wait, he just straight up told you
you're moving across the country?

12:23.202 --> 12:27.331
‐ No, he pretended to have a conversation,
but I know the truth.

12:27.331 --> 12:29.708
I mean, my whole life,
my dad has put his career first.

12:29.708 --> 12:32.252
There are hardly any Black
university presidents,

12:32.252 --> 12:36.298
and so he's constantly just
trying to prove himself.

12:36.298 --> 12:40.761
And if that means missing vacations,
or family dinners,

12:40.761 --> 12:45.182
or leaving for weeks on end
to visit alumni, then he does it.

12:45.182 --> 12:49.394
And... and I understand why he has to.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.063
I'm proud of him.

12:51.063 --> 12:53.607
‐ Yes. Your father is a very
impressive human.

12:53.607 --> 12:56.109
But that doesn't mean he gets to
blow your life up like this.

12:56.109 --> 12:59.488
‐ Hey, Andrew, I could try and fight it,
but at the end of the day,

12:59.488 --> 13:01.907
he's going to choose his job over me.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.409
I learned that a long time ago.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.708
[bell rings]

13:23.887 --> 13:25.514
[sighs]

13:28.767 --> 13:30.102
[line ringing]

13:30.727 --> 13:31.895
[beeps]

13:31.895 --> 13:34.773
‐ Hey, Benji, um,

13:34.773 --> 13:36.817
did you turn off your phone?

13:37.651 --> 13:41.780
Mia, uh, she told us all that
she's moving to California,

13:41.780 --> 13:44.074
and I just really wanted to talk to you,

13:44.074 --> 13:46.368
so if you could call me back,
that'd be great. Bye.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.791
Oh! Rahim...

13:52.791 --> 13:56.003
Uh, were you standing there
the whole time?

13:56.003 --> 13:59.256
‐ Yeah. Um, you, you didn't see me.

13:59.256 --> 14:01.550
Then you started leaving
a really emotional voicemail,

14:01.550 --> 14:03.510
so I didn't really know what to do.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.305
‐ I didn't know anyone actually
used this room.

14:06.305 --> 14:09.391
‐ Well, I do. For yearbook.

14:09.391 --> 14:11.810
I actually have really
great shot of you on this roll.

14:11.810 --> 14:14.271
I'll make you a print.
‐ Okay.

14:19.193 --> 14:22.738
‐ That message you were leaving
sounded pretty intense.

14:23.822 --> 14:24.990
‐ Uh...

14:26.700 --> 14:29.828
Benji and I got into a fight.

14:29.828 --> 14:32.706
A bad one.
‐ Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

14:32.706 --> 14:35.167
‐ It's okay. It's just, uh...

14:35.167 --> 14:37.336
he skipped school and he turned
off his phone,

14:37.336 --> 14:38.879
and I'm trying not to freak out,

14:38.879 --> 14:40.589
but I'm kind of worried about him.

14:40.589 --> 14:42.549
‐ Worried? Why?

14:42.549 --> 14:45.802
‐ I, I can't really talk about it.

14:45.802 --> 14:50.432
‐ You sure? Nothing ever leaves
this dark room, I promise.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.186
‐ Okay. Please don't tell anyone,

14:54.186 --> 14:58.565
but Benji's had some problems
in the past with drinking.

14:58.565 --> 15:01.652
He's sober now, but I don't know.

15:01.652 --> 15:03.779
He just seemed so upset today, and...

15:03.779 --> 15:06.573
[beeping]
‐ What was the fight about?

15:09.159 --> 15:14.498
‐ Uh, he's really mad that I haven't been
standing up to my mom more.

15:14.498 --> 15:17.084
I've explained to him
that my mom is trying her best,

15:17.084 --> 15:19.670
you know, with me being gay,
and he's just...

15:19.670 --> 15:21.672
‐ White? Sorry.

15:21.672 --> 15:23.757
I did not mean to be presumptuous.

15:23.757 --> 15:27.636
Um, it's just most
of my friends are white,

15:27.636 --> 15:30.722
so they don't get it at all.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.349
How can you love your parents

15:32.349 --> 15:35.978
when you hate a lot of
what they believe in?

15:35.978 --> 15:39.439
But you do, because...

15:39.439 --> 15:41.984
you know how much they sacrificed
to build a life for you.

15:43.694 --> 15:45.904
‐ Yeah. You're right.

15:45.904 --> 15:48.407
I mean, my dad's worked basically
every single Saturday

15:48.407 --> 15:50.784
of my entire life to make sure
that we have what we need.

15:50.784 --> 15:53.203
‐ Yeah. My parents left everything
they knew in Iran

15:53.203 --> 15:55.914
so that I could have better opportunities.

15:55.914 --> 15:58.750
I'm not saying that gives them
a free pass to be homophobic.

15:58.750 --> 16:02.504
But, my, my parents
were set up by their parents.

16:02.504 --> 16:06.175
And they only met twice
before their wedding.

16:06.175 --> 16:10.262
In their eyes, marriage is between
a man and a woman

16:10.262 --> 16:13.140
who come from a good Iranian,
Muslim family.

16:13.140 --> 16:16.476
So, I know it's gonna be hard for them,

16:16.476 --> 16:19.771
when I do come out, but...

16:19.771 --> 16:22.357
I'm willing to stick it out.

16:22.357 --> 16:23.901
I have to.

16:23.901 --> 16:26.278
They're my parents.

16:26.278 --> 16:28.280
‐ That's exactly it.

16:31.116 --> 16:33.285
‐ Anyway, uh,

16:33.285 --> 16:35.621
I'm sure Benji's gonna be okay.

16:35.621 --> 16:37.497
And I know you two are gonna work it out,

16:37.497 --> 16:40.000
because you're kind of annoyingly
perfect for each other.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.127
[laughs]
Case in point...

16:44.338 --> 16:46.423
‐ Wow, this is amazing.

16:46.423 --> 16:48.091
‐ Don't act so surprised.

16:49.301 --> 16:51.470
[church bell tolls]

16:52.638 --> 16:55.891
‐ How was CCD?
‐ It was fine.

16:55.891 --> 16:59.436
‐ Fine? Usually you're talking
my ear off about church gossip.

17:01.355 --> 17:03.815
‐ Is Victor going to Hell?

17:03.815 --> 17:06.985
‐ What? Who told you that?

17:06.985 --> 17:08.403
‐ Father Lawrence.

17:08.403 --> 17:11.573
I told him about Victor's boyfriend,
and he said it was a sin.

17:13.992 --> 17:17.204
‐ Adrian, look at me, okay?

17:17.204 --> 17:19.831
Victor's not going to Hell.

17:19.831 --> 17:23.126
Your brother is one of the most

17:23.126 --> 17:26.505
generous and loving people I know.

17:26.505 --> 17:29.341
‐ But Father Lawrence‐‐
‐ Father Lawrence...

17:32.302 --> 17:33.512
...is wrong.

17:33.512 --> 17:35.722
‐ But he said it's in the Bible.

17:35.722 --> 17:40.644
‐ Well, the... the Bible

17:40.644 --> 17:43.814
can be interpreted
in many different ways.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.776
But in this family,

17:47.776 --> 17:51.280
we believe that Jesus knows
who has love in their hearts.

17:51.280 --> 17:53.532
And he would never
punish people for that.

17:53.532 --> 17:54.992
Okay?
‐ Okay.

17:54.992 --> 17:55.826
‐ Come on.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.290
‐ Where are we going?
‐ I forgot something inside.

18:05.169 --> 18:09.423
‐ It takes eight hundred and thirty hours
to fly from Atlanta to San Francisco?

18:09.423 --> 18:12.676
Oh, wait. I'm on walking.
It's only five hours by plane.

18:12.676 --> 18:14.344
‐ It's still very bad.

18:14.344 --> 18:17.890
‐ Okay, guys, enough talking
about me moving.

18:17.890 --> 18:19.892
I'm gonna go make us some mac and cheese.

18:19.892 --> 18:23.061
All right, and we're gonna eat it
in silence.

18:24.980 --> 18:29.318
‐ [sighs] We can't
let this happen, Andrew.

18:29.318 --> 18:32.029
‐ I don't really think it's up to us.

18:33.238 --> 18:34.656
‐ Or is it?

18:40.204 --> 18:42.748
BENJI: Oh, hey, thanks for, uh,
coming over so last minute.

18:42.748 --> 18:44.875
‐ Of course. Of course.
‐ I appreciate it.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.001
‐ Yeah, man.

18:52.799 --> 18:56.261
‐ Victor. What are you doing here?

18:56.261 --> 18:58.597
‐ Uh, I was making sure you're okay

18:58.597 --> 19:01.767
'cause you never showed up
at school today.

19:01.767 --> 19:04.394
‐ Right. Got it. Um... [sighs]

19:04.394 --> 19:06.104
Well, Hank was just leaving.

19:06.104 --> 19:08.857
Uh, Hank, this is my boyfriend, Victor.

19:08.857 --> 19:12.361
Hank's my, uh... my sponsor.

19:12.361 --> 19:16.073
‐ It's nice to finally meet you, Victor.
‐ It's, uh, it's nice to meet you, too.

19:16.073 --> 19:17.741
‐ See you later?
‐ Yeah.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.831
‐ I didn't know you had a sponsor.

19:26.625 --> 19:28.293
‐ Well, I do. [exhales]

19:30.879 --> 19:33.382
You want to come in?
‐ Yeah.

19:37.302 --> 19:38.428
[sighs]

19:42.850 --> 19:44.560
‐ Oh, my God. No password?

19:44.560 --> 19:46.854
Old people are so bad at cyber security.

19:46.854 --> 19:48.397
‐ Whatcha doin' here, Lake?

19:48.397 --> 19:51.483
‐ I am going to post an offensive tweet
to Harold's account.

19:51.483 --> 19:54.152
Something just bad enough
to get him lightly canceled.

19:54.152 --> 19:56.822
Now, does Harold strike you
as more of a flat‐Earther,

19:56.822 --> 19:59.825
or Holocaust‐denier?
‐ Uh, Lake,

19:59.825 --> 20:03.620
I have always found your crazy
kind of endearing.

20:03.620 --> 20:06.248
Right now, I'm just finding it
a bit unnerving.

20:10.586 --> 20:13.505
‐ I can't lose Mia, Andrew.

20:13.505 --> 20:16.049
It was bad enough that seeing Felix
in the lunch room today

20:16.049 --> 20:17.926
almost gave me a panic attack.

20:17.926 --> 20:20.596
A week ago we were happy and in love,

20:20.596 --> 20:23.599
and now I don't even know
how to say hi to him.

20:23.599 --> 20:27.603
I can't lose the other most
important person in my life too.

20:27.603 --> 20:29.104
‐ I hear you.

20:29.104 --> 20:31.565
Okay? I really do.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.655
‐ No, just‐‐ give that back!
‐ No.

20:38.655 --> 20:41.742
‐ Andrew...
‐ I'm sorry. You're in a very
dark place right now.

20:41.742 --> 20:44.203
‐ What the hell is wrong with you?

20:44.203 --> 20:46.079
Do you even care that she's leaving?

20:46.079 --> 20:47.456
‐ Of course I do.

20:47.456 --> 20:49.666
Okay, look, the girl I love is getting
ripped away from me.

20:49.666 --> 20:52.711
There is nothing I can do about it,
and it is killing me.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.922
‐ You love her?

20:57.090 --> 20:58.342
‐ You love me?

21:01.386 --> 21:02.721
‐ Of course I do.

21:04.598 --> 21:06.225
‐ I love you, too.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.062
‐ So why don't you fight for us?

21:15.108 --> 21:16.985
PILAR: Hi.
‐ Hey.

21:16.985 --> 21:19.321
‐ I got you a coffee.
‐ Oh, thanks.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.076
‐ How was seeing your mom?

21:25.536 --> 21:27.538
‐ It was okay. Yeah, um,

21:27.538 --> 21:29.957
they, uh, got her on new mood stabilizers.

21:29.957 --> 21:32.209
So, that seems to be helping.

21:32.209 --> 21:34.670
And she really likes her new therapist.

21:34.670 --> 21:37.089
‐ That's great. Right?

21:37.089 --> 21:40.008
‐ Yeah. Yeah, no, it's just, um...

21:41.468 --> 21:42.928
It's so sterile.

21:44.054 --> 21:46.139
White walls, white floor.

21:46.139 --> 21:48.433
And everything she loves is off limits.

21:48.433 --> 21:53.647
No Millionaire, no weird knick‐knacks...

21:53.647 --> 21:56.942
Swedish Fish...
Why is Swedish Fish contraband?

21:57.985 --> 22:01.280
It's like they're taking away
everything that makes her who she is.

22:01.280 --> 22:04.366
‐ Felix, it sounds like
she's getting better.

22:04.366 --> 22:06.827
And your mom is fierce.

22:06.827 --> 22:10.956
It would take way more than an inhumane
Swedish Fish ban to dull her sparkle.

22:10.956 --> 22:14.293
‐ [chuckles]
She's getting discharged next week.

22:15.711 --> 22:19.965
Yeah. She's really put in the work
this time. I'm proud of her.

22:19.965 --> 22:23.677
You should be.
You should be proud of yourself, too.

22:23.677 --> 22:26.680
How strong you've been
through all this?

22:26.680 --> 22:29.600
It's pretty inspiring. Or whatever.

22:34.271 --> 22:36.064
‐ You always know what to say.

22:36.064 --> 22:37.900
‐ I know. I'm really smart.

22:37.900 --> 22:39.109
‐ No, seriously.

22:39.109 --> 22:41.612
I mean, you act like you don't care
about anything,

22:41.612 --> 22:44.239
but you might be one of the most
thoughtful people I've ever met.

22:52.831 --> 22:53.999
‐ Uh‐‐
‐ Pilar.

22:53.999 --> 22:56.543
‐ I'm sorry. I‐‐
‐ No. No, no, no. Don't be.

22:56.543 --> 22:58.212
I, uh, you know, our, our friendship

22:58.212 --> 23:00.214
means the world‐‐
‐ I have to go.

23:00.214 --> 23:01.548
‐ Pilar, wait.

23:08.764 --> 23:10.265
MIA:
Um, Dad?

23:13.769 --> 23:16.772
Can we, can we talk?
‐ Of course, baby.

23:16.772 --> 23:18.607
[keyboard keys clicking]

23:21.568 --> 23:22.945
‐ Mom emailed me.

23:25.948 --> 23:27.199
‐ When?

23:27.199 --> 23:30.118
‐ Mmm, a few days ago.

23:30.118 --> 23:32.579
Totally out of the blue.

23:32.579 --> 23:34.915
[groans]

23:34.915 --> 23:37.751
‐ [scoffs] What'd she say?

23:39.545 --> 23:43.382
‐ Not much. Hi. How are you?

23:43.382 --> 23:45.342
Something about how the last few years

23:45.342 --> 23:47.928
have been really complicated for her...

23:49.346 --> 23:52.015
And that she'd love to hear from me.

23:53.350 --> 23:56.228
‐ Wow. Um...

23:56.228 --> 23:58.230
Did you respond?

23:58.230 --> 23:59.606
‐ No.

23:59.606 --> 24:02.776
I think about answering her every morning.

24:02.776 --> 24:06.905
But I just can't bring myself
to write her back.

24:06.905 --> 24:10.200
Even though I have,
like, a million questions...
‐ Yeah.

24:10.200 --> 24:12.452
‐ Because I feel like...

24:12.953 --> 24:17.708
writing her back
would be, like, a betrayal to you.

24:19.585 --> 24:21.837
You know. She left. You stayed.

24:23.755 --> 24:25.674
You're my family. Not her.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.012
I choose you.

24:35.267 --> 24:37.436
So how come you never choose me?

24:40.314 --> 24:42.649
My whole life,
you've put your work first.

24:43.275 --> 24:46.361
Which I understand. Um...

24:47.988 --> 24:49.781
Because I know how much
it means to you,

24:49.781 --> 24:51.700
and I don't want to hold you back.

24:53.243 --> 24:55.954
[sighs] I never ask you for anything.

24:56.997 --> 25:01.585
But this is me asking now...

25:01.585 --> 25:04.171
This is me saying...

25:04.171 --> 25:06.548
just please, don't move us.

25:06.548 --> 25:08.759
Okay? Just this once...

25:08.759 --> 25:10.135
choose me.

25:14.640 --> 25:17.476
‐ Um...

25:17.476 --> 25:22.105
I'll, uh... tell Stanford

25:22.105 --> 25:26.568
that my family is happy
right here in Atlanta.

25:29.696 --> 25:30.906
‐ Really?

25:31.740 --> 25:33.116
‐ Yeah.

25:36.537 --> 25:38.121
[chuckles]

25:40.541 --> 25:43.043
‐ Thank you.
‐ Of course, baby.

25:43.752 --> 25:45.254
[groans]

25:51.677 --> 25:53.428
Hey, Mia. Um...

25:54.847 --> 25:58.183
You know, you should answer
your mom, if you want.

26:06.275 --> 26:08.110
[sighs]

26:37.639 --> 26:40.517
‐ Isabel. Did we have an appointment?

26:40.517 --> 26:42.811
‐ No, we did not.

26:46.857 --> 26:48.692
You told Adrian that Victor,

26:48.692 --> 26:52.905
who he loves more than anyone
in the whole world,

26:52.905 --> 26:54.656
is going to Hell?

26:55.574 --> 26:59.203
‐ I did not use those exact words.

26:59.203 --> 27:03.207
I was just trying to explain that Victor
needs his family's help

27:03.207 --> 27:06.460
to find his way back to Jesus‐‐
‐ What Victor needs

27:06.460 --> 27:09.338
is for his family to love and accept him
for who he is.

27:09.338 --> 27:12.508
‐ Isabel, you and I both know
it is not that simple.

27:12.508 --> 27:14.885
‐ Actually, I think it is.

27:14.885 --> 27:18.680
Today, I saw Adrian accept his
brother without a second thought.

27:20.849 --> 27:22.976
I have been raised to believe

27:22.976 --> 27:26.021
a lot of ugly things, Father.

27:26.021 --> 27:29.024
Things that will probably take me
the rest of my life to unlearn.

27:29.024 --> 27:30.776
But I will unlearn them.

27:30.776 --> 27:33.570
And I won't pass them on to my kids.

27:33.570 --> 27:35.489
And no matter what you or the church say,

27:35.489 --> 27:39.243
I know in my heart that God
loves my son.

27:39.243 --> 27:44.957
My beautiful, perfect, gay son.

27:48.085 --> 27:51.129
You're gonna have to find a new
music director, Father.

27:51.129 --> 27:52.464
[keys clatter]

27:52.464 --> 27:56.260
‐ Isabel, I urge you
not to give up on God.

27:57.010 --> 28:00.180
‐ I'm not giving up on God.

28:00.180 --> 28:02.140
I'm giving up on you.

28:06.520 --> 28:09.815
‐ Dr. Gallico. Yeah, Harold Brooks, here.

28:10.774 --> 28:13.610
I have.
I, I have given it a lot of thought.

28:13.610 --> 28:16.989
And I, I really appreciate the
opportunity, I do...

28:16.989 --> 28:18.782
And, uh...

28:23.704 --> 28:25.747
I can't wait to get to work.

28:25.747 --> 28:29.501
[laughs] Right...

28:29.501 --> 28:31.545
Yeah, California, here we come.

28:34.339 --> 28:35.382
Sure.

28:35.757 --> 28:39.011
[water running]
‐ Uh, your sponsor's kind of cute.

28:39.469 --> 28:43.724
I always expected sponsors to just be
these big, old, grizzly men,

28:43.724 --> 28:45.309
filled with wisdom.

28:46.935 --> 28:48.353
‐ He's straight.

28:48.353 --> 28:49.855
In case you were wondering.

28:49.855 --> 28:51.899
‐ I wasn't. I, I trust you.

28:55.819 --> 28:58.363
You can't just fall off
the face of the Earth.

28:58.363 --> 29:01.325
I was really worried today.

29:01.325 --> 29:02.868
[sighs]

29:02.868 --> 29:06.955
‐ This is exactly why I didn't want
to tell you I was in AA.

29:06.955 --> 29:08.832
‐ What do you mean?

29:08.832 --> 29:10.918
‐ Well, now every time we have a fight

29:10.918 --> 29:13.921
or I don't respond to a text,

29:13.921 --> 29:16.381
you're gonna think I'm off
getting hammered.

29:16.381 --> 29:19.468
‐ Well, I was right to worry,
wasn't I?

29:19.468 --> 29:21.553
I mean, you had to call your sponsor.

29:21.553 --> 29:23.514
‐ That's not the point. I'm‐‐

29:29.144 --> 29:30.896
[exhales deeply]

29:33.232 --> 29:34.691
What's going on with us?

29:37.444 --> 29:38.612
‐ I don't know.

29:40.531 --> 29:44.576
‐ Everything was amazing,

29:44.576 --> 29:47.120
and now it feels like all we do is fight.

29:49.081 --> 29:50.082
‐ Yeah.

29:52.835 --> 29:57.506
‐ I've been thinking a lot about this
perfect day, from last summer.

29:58.757 --> 30:01.844
We had that picnic at Kennedy Park,

30:01.844 --> 30:05.472
and then after, we chased
the Mister Softee truck for 15 blocks

30:05.472 --> 30:07.391
so we could get soft serve.
[Victor chuckles]

30:08.642 --> 30:12.312
And the park was packed
but it felt like we were the...

30:12.312 --> 30:14.314
only two people in the world.

30:18.861 --> 30:20.404
‐ It always does.

30:22.948 --> 30:24.283
[indistinct whisper]

30:32.374 --> 30:33.876
‐ I love that.

30:36.170 --> 30:37.379
‐ Me, too.

30:37.963 --> 30:39.131
[phone buzzes]

30:44.595 --> 30:47.306
‐ Why does Rahim hope I'm okay?

30:49.725 --> 30:54.855
‐ Oh, I just‐‐
I needed someone to talk to.

30:54.855 --> 30:56.815
So I told him that we had a fight.

30:58.233 --> 31:01.028
‐ Did you tell him about my drinking?

31:04.406 --> 31:08.035
[sighs] Jesus, Victor.

31:08.035 --> 31:09.995
‐ I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I know I shouldn't have told him.

31:09.995 --> 31:11.997
But he's not gonna say anything to anyone.

31:11.997 --> 31:14.249
Okay? I can trust him‐‐
‐ But I can't trust you.
