I've just been a fan of you

That was kind of like the
first music that I listened to

19:10.900 --> 19:12.732

at me.

Adam's gonna be the most bummed.

19:18.500 --> 19:19.800
It's because of you
and her.

19:20.600 --> 19:23.466

his mom loves you,

connected to this.

about y'all boys

is that every time

our days consist of school,

20:47.308 --> 20:49.541
making food and cleaning up

he could play the piano.

25:59.858 --> 26:02.191

I was raised on Elton John,
Billy Joel, the Eagles, Beatles.

- How's it going, Blake?

29:55.658 --> 29:59.591
I had a vision of you
and Alicia Keys, like...
Okay.

29:59.592 --> 30:01.591
You know those things
where they play,

30:01.592 --> 30:03.424

facing each other

30:03.425 --> 30:06.824
in, like, a duet, like... like
Elton John and Billy Joel do.

30:06.825 --> 30:10.057
But if you had Alicia Keys as
your coach, you could do that.

30:10.058 --> 30:12.324
I was just thinking.

that would be a huge moment.

I feel like there are

30:14.525 --> 30:17.357
other combinations
of instruments that
can also take place.

30:17.358 --> 30:18.557
- A huge moment.

only the piano, just you,

totally my heart.

to just play the piano

a little bit more

about how did you get into
singing, what's your story?

you were, like, 2, 4, 1, born?

in the world, yeah.

31:06.225 --> 31:08.224
Right. Came out singing.

31:08.225 --> 31:12.224
And that particular song
was such a beautiful example

31:12.225 --> 31:15.224
of what happens when you're able
to spread a message

31:15.225 --> 31:17.157
and write a song
that no one can deny.

31:17.158 --> 31:18.824
I totally felt it,

31:18.825 --> 31:21.757

to work together.

with my mother, my grandmother,
and my grandpa.

33:36.208 --> 33:37.674
My grandfather was a pastor,

hallelujah and da-da-da-da-da.

I started to play piano,

how it all started.

33:49.175 --> 33:52.307

it's the inner city,

33:52.308 --> 33:54.407

I felt like I solved the puzzle,
like, on "Wheel of Fortune."

48:33.408 --> 48:35.007
I was like...
I was like, "Ah, Cher!"

48:35.008 --> 48:37.407
[Laughter]

48:37.408 --> 48:38.974
Awesome, man.
Congratulations, Taylor.

48:38.975 --> 48:42.207
That's really cool.
I love that mixture.
Thank you very much.

48:42.208 --> 48:44.341
[Cheers and applause]
Hey, Taylor.

48:44.342 --> 48:47.607
People always look at me
when a country singer auditions,

48:47.608 --> 48:49.574
and just to be
completely honest,

48:49.575 --> 48:51.207
when I saw Adam hit his button

48:51.208 --> 48:52.707
and you have an opportunity
to go there,

48:52.708 --> 48:55.441
where there's a wide-open lane,
that's the best thing for you.

48:55.442 --> 48:58.174
And I think I know the lane
you're in for country music.

48:58.175 --> 49:02.541
The BR549-type thing,
so when it's time...

49:02.542 --> 49:04.541
- More like HRTX490.
- If you... If you need...

49:04.542 --> 49:06.074
If you need the...

49:06.075 --> 49:07.707
What is that?
I don't know what the hell
he's talking about.

49:07.708 --> 49:09.807
- Well, he knows.
- I'm with you, man.

49:09.808 --> 49:11.807
Yeah, and so, when it's time,
I'm here for both of y'all.

49:11.808 --> 49:13.107
- That's what I'm saying.
- Aww.

49:13.108 --> 49:15.007
The only difference between...
Well, thank you, thank you.

49:15.008 --> 49:17.407
- Aww.
- Aww, Blake.

49:17.408 --> 49:19.674
Because he didn't know what
the hell we're talking about...
I want to just say...

49:19.675 --> 49:21.707
...that's why
I'm letting him know.
I just want to say one...

49:21.708 --> 49:24.274
It's not like WD40
or the B-52s.

49:24.275 --> 49:26.907
- It's like BR549.
- Okay, cool.

49:26.908 --> 49:28.441
I just want to say,
good songs are good songs,

49:28.442 --> 49:30.374
good singers
are good singers,

49:30.375 --> 49:31.307
and there's nothing
you could ever do

49:31.308 --> 49:32.407
to separate those things.

49:32.408 --> 49:33.941
Like, you can't put
anything in a box.

49:33.942 --> 49:36.441
- You can't.
- True.

49:36.442 --> 49:39.807
And I think that's badass
and deserves to be rewarded,

49:39.808 --> 49:40.907
and you're on my team.

49:40.908 --> 49:42.541
Thank you very much.
Thank y'all.

That was so crazy.
I love it, I love it.
Thank you.

49:48.908 --> 49:51.341
Adam: Anyone that's gonna do
a traditional country version

49:51.342 --> 49:54.274
of Cher's "Believe"
gets a turn.

49:54.275 --> 49:56.441
Clearly, anything's possible
with that guy.

49:56.442 --> 49:57.507
I'm excited to have Taylor
on my team.

49:57.508 --> 50:00.507
- Nice job there, brother.
- Whoo!

50:00.508 --> 50:02.441

learn a lot from Adam.

50:02.442 --> 50:03.741

50:03.742 --> 50:05.774
that do completely different
style of music than me

50:05.775 --> 50:08.474
and learning from them
is gonna be really awesome.

50:08.475 --> 50:11.441
Is there some, like,
Dr. Evil guy back there?

I'm from Seattle, Washington,

in New York City.

Being from a Filipino family,
we'd always have karaoke.

51:01.475 --> 51:04.307
She was about 3, 4 years old.
It was a party.

51:04.308 --> 51:05.674
It was, like,
down in the basement,

51:05.675 --> 51:07.707
and then she sang
"I Will Survive."

51:07.708 --> 51:09.307
I mean,
it just shocked me.

51:09.308 --> 51:11.107
"How the heck
did she know how to sing?"

51:11.108 --> 51:14.007
At 9 years old, my parents
put me in vocal lessons,

51:14.008 --> 51:15.574
and at 12,
I started making demos

51:15.575 --> 51:18.174
and fell in love
with being in the studio.

51:18.175 --> 51:21.607
When I was 15, my sister
was living in New York City.

51:21.608 --> 51:24.574
And she sent in my demo
to this production company.

51:24.575 --> 51:25.974
They ended up really liking me,

51:25.975 --> 51:27.874
and I ended up moving
a few months later.

51:27.875 --> 51:30.541
When she moved to New York
at 15, I didn't like it.

51:30.542 --> 51:32.707
I kept crying every day,

51:32.708 --> 51:34.507
kept calling her
like three times a day,

51:34.508 --> 51:37.207
but then when I went to New York
and see her there,

51:37.208 --> 51:38.474
I was so proud.

51:38.475 --> 51:40.707
I was getting my GED online,

as well as recording
every single day.

I met John Legend,

with him.

51:49.542 --> 51:51.307
Even though it didn't work out,

- Yes.

It's what I've come to expect.

56:40.642 --> 56:43.107
You got signed
to a production deal,

which production deals
are the worst.

56:45.475 --> 56:48.807
Tell me about it.
Because they basically
don't have to commit to you,

56:48.808 --> 56:50.441
and they "develop you,"

56:50.442 --> 56:52.007
and then, like,
leave you high and dry.

- Exactly.

01:06:20.525 --> 01:06:22.691
and my sister and I
are in a band together.

01:06:22.692 --> 01:06:23.824
- Wow.
- Wow.

01:06:23.825 --> 01:06:25.691
- Nice.
- Wow.

01:06:25.692 --> 01:06:27.091
What's the band?

01:06:27.092 --> 01:06:28.891
The band's called The Out Go.

01:06:28.892 --> 01:06:30.224
I wanted you to get a plug in
for them there.

01:06:30.225 --> 01:06:33.057
Can you tell me what made you
choose that song?

01:06:33.058 --> 01:06:34.491
Honestly, it was the message.

01:06:34.492 --> 01:06:37.157
To be able to stand
even for 90 seconds

01:06:37.158 --> 01:06:40.024
and tell people that they're
beautiful just the way they are,

01:06:40.025 --> 01:06:41.791
that's what I'm trying to do
through my music. So...

01:06:41.792 --> 01:06:43.657
[Applause]

01:06:43.658 --> 01:06:45.924
Yeah,
I totally understand.

01:06:45.925 --> 01:06:48.491
Thank you.
If you're given a gift
like that,

01:06:48.492 --> 01:06:50.791
to have a message
to spread with it.

01:06:50.792 --> 01:06:52.524
That's what I'd love to help you
continue to do

01:06:52.525 --> 01:06:54.824
as your coach
if you chose me.

01:06:54.825 --> 01:06:56.624
I think that's
the most important thing

01:06:56.625 --> 01:06:57.791
that there ever is.

01:06:57.792 --> 01:06:59.957
So it's really amazing
to meet you, Missy.

01:06:59.958 --> 01:07:01.457
I'm so proud of you
already.

01:07:01.458 --> 01:07:03.557
Thank you so much.

01:07:03.558 --> 01:07:06.124
Alicia Keys is right here next
to me, and she's hit her button.

01:07:06.125 --> 01:07:08.691
I'm sure that you're going,

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:12.191
"What would this country guy
have for me?"

01:07:12.192 --> 01:07:13.591
You're amazing, Blake,
I have to say that.

01:07:13.592 --> 01:07:14.657
- That's right. That's right.
- Thank you. Wow. Thank you.

01:07:14.658 --> 01:07:16.224
You're amazing.
[Applause]

01:07:16.225 --> 01:07:18.324
That's right,
Blake Shelton.
Thank you,
thank you very much.

01:07:18.325 --> 01:07:21.057
- That's a little plug for you.
- Thank you, thank you.

01:07:21.058 --> 01:07:22.891
[Laughter]

01:07:22.892 --> 01:07:24.491
'Cause he needs...
he needs it, he needs it.
I like Missy.

01:07:24.492 --> 01:07:25.624
Well, you know what?

01:07:25.625 --> 01:07:27.591
I want somebody on my team

01:07:27.592 --> 01:07:30.224
that is not like anybody else
on my team.

01:07:30.225 --> 01:07:32.924
I know Alicia may seem like
the obvious choice.

01:07:32.925 --> 01:07:35.157
Why don't you think outside
the box a little bit?

01:07:35.158 --> 01:07:37.957
[Laughter]
Spoken like
a true politician.

01:07:37.958 --> 01:07:40.491
Step outside
of your comfort zone.

01:07:40.492 --> 01:07:41.591
He's literally saying

01:07:41.592 --> 01:07:43.657
exactly what I always tell
country artists.

01:07:43.658 --> 01:07:46.191
I want you to know that
the person that is over there

01:07:46.192 --> 01:07:47.891
that's trying to get you
on their team...

01:07:47.892 --> 01:07:49.524
How paranoid does that man
sound right now?
That is the most classic...

01:07:49.525 --> 01:07:52.357
It's the most classic
definition of manipulation
I could possibly imagine.

01:07:52.358 --> 01:07:53.891
It's the most classic definition
of paranoia.

01:07:53.892 --> 01:07:55.391
[Laughter]

01:07:55.392 --> 01:07:57.724
It is true how he's saying
this now.

01:07:57.725 --> 01:07:59.524
I actually agree.

01:07:59.525 --> 01:08:01.924
There is something really cool
about doing the unexpected.

01:08:01.925 --> 01:08:03.824
I think there's something
really awesome about that.

01:08:03.825 --> 01:08:06.991
Either way, you're on the show,
so just follow your heart.

01:08:06.992 --> 01:08:08.457
- They both want you...
- Yeah.

01:08:08.458 --> 01:08:09.757
...and this is
a magical moment.

01:08:09.758 --> 01:08:10.857
Thank you.

01:08:10.858 --> 01:08:12.557
Missy, it's time.

01:08:12.558 --> 01:08:15.091
Come on, Missy.
Who do you pick as your coach?

01:08:15.092 --> 01:08:16.224
Whoa.

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:18.224
[Audience shouting]

01:08:18.225 --> 01:08:19.591
This is so hard.

01:08:21.058 --> 01:08:25.191
I really love you both so much.

01:08:25.192 --> 01:08:27.323
I pick...

01:08:27.325 --> 01:08:28.323
- Alicia.
- Really?

01:08:28.325 --> 01:08:29.057
Yeah.

01:08:29.058 --> 01:08:30.591
[Audience shouting]

01:08:32.024 --> 01:08:33.924
I pick Alicia.

01:08:33.925 --> 01:08:36.191
All right! All right!
[Cheers and applause]

01:08:36.192 --> 01:08:38.057
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

01:08:38.058 --> 01:08:39.124
Whoo!

01:08:39.125 --> 01:08:40.624
I couldn't let
that voice go.

01:08:40.625 --> 01:08:42.390
Alicia:
I was really moved by her,

01:08:42.392 --> 01:08:44.791
and I can't even wait
to see what she brings out.

01:08:44.792 --> 01:08:46.424
It's gonna be pretty crazy.

01:08:46.425 --> 01:08:47.991
[Cheers and applause]
Yes!

01:08:47.992 --> 01:08:50.291
I'm on a losing streak
right now, and I don't know why.

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:52.323
I'm really hoping
my day picks up.

01:08:52.325 --> 01:08:54.491
Good luck to you, sweetie.
Happy for you.
Thank you.

01:08:54.492 --> 01:08:56.457
Missy: I didn't think anyone
turned around.

01:08:56.457 --> 01:08:58.024
Literally,
it was the last second.

01:08:58.024 --> 01:08:59.791
That was so crazy.

01:08:59.792 --> 01:09:01.057
I can't wait to bring up

01:09:01.058 --> 01:09:03.524
that I'm surprised that they
brought you back as a coach

01:09:03.524 --> 01:09:06.291
'cause you were such
a terrible coach last year.

01:09:06.292 --> 01:09:08.890
Getting in your head.
I'm getting in your head.

01:09:08.892 --> 01:09:11.158

I'm 14 years old,

I come from a big,

There's five kids
and my mom and dad.

01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:47.582
We live with our grandparents

01:09:47.582 --> 01:09:50.049
because financial issues
are a little bit of a struggle.

01:09:50.050 --> 01:09:52.649
It's kind of hard because
we have nine people in the house

01:09:52.649 --> 01:09:54.382
plus my dog, but [laughs]

01:09:54.383 --> 01:09:56.216
I'm really happy and proud.

01:09:56.217 --> 01:09:59.949
She really has a gift
to share with people,

01:09:59.950 --> 01:10:02.549
and she can touch
people's hearts.

01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:04.949
It was a gift
she was just born with.

01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:07.317
- It's definitely not me.
- [Chuckles]

01:10:08.050 --> 01:10:09.949
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:13.082
Aaliyah: Growing up, I was
always singing around the house

01:10:13.083 --> 01:10:16.382
with my little fake microphone
that I got for Christmas.

01:10:16.383 --> 01:10:19.449
I did singing competitions,
county fairs,

01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:22.082
and when I was 10 years old,

01:10:22.083 --> 01:10:25.349
I wanted to start sharing
my music with the world,

01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:28.282
so my parents started
a YouTube channel for me.

01:10:28.283 --> 01:10:32.182
This is my first YouTube video,
and I'm gonna be doing a cover

01:10:32.183 --> 01:10:34.516
of Dani and Lizzy
"Dancing in the Sky."

01:10:34.517 --> 01:10:36.016
I hope you like it.

01:10:36.017 --> 01:10:38.782
I got hundreds of thousands of
views on that, like, overnight.

01:10:38.783 --> 01:10:40.282
And I was like,
"Oh, my goodness.

01:10:40.283 --> 01:10:42.049
People actually like
to hear me sing."

01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:43.516
So we just started doing more.

01:10:43.517 --> 01:10:45.882
I wouldn't even know
how to make a YouTube channel.

01:10:45.883 --> 01:10:47.182
We didn't really know,
either, though.

01:10:47.183 --> 01:10:48.382
Is the whole family
in on it?

01:10:48.383 --> 01:10:50.982
Yeah, she films and edits
all of my videos,

01:10:50.983 --> 01:10:54.349

like, my number-one fans.

01:10:56.783 --> 01:11:00.016

bit of hate on social media,

01:11:00.017 --> 01:11:03.816

like, try to make them stop.

01:11:03.817 --> 01:11:05.082

Meghan Trainor posted my video
on Twitter,

01:11:14.817 --> 01:11:16.349

01:11:18.850 --> 01:11:20.449
We started talking
back and forth,

01:11:20.450 --> 01:11:22.816

the sweetest person ever.

01:11:22.817 --> 01:11:24.983
I want to show you
a little video here.

01:11:25.983 --> 01:11:28.216
Hi, Aaliyah.
It's Meghan Trainor,

01:11:28.217 --> 01:11:30.016
and I heard you're auditioning
for "The Voice."

01:11:30.017 --> 01:11:31.149
Best of luck.

01:11:31.150 --> 01:11:32.616
I know you're gonna be amazing,
though.

01:11:32.617 --> 01:11:34.049
Oh, my goodness.

01:11:34.050 --> 01:11:36.716
And just be yourself
and go get your dreams, girl.

01:11:36.717 --> 01:11:38.516
Mwah!
I love you so much.

01:11:38.517 --> 01:11:39.982
Oh, my goodness.

01:11:39.983 --> 01:11:42.417
- How about that?
- That is so cool.

01:11:43.450 --> 01:11:45.816
Aaliyah:
Ever since I started singing,

01:11:45.817 --> 01:11:48.982
I just knew I just wanted
to sing for the rest of my life.

01:11:48.983 --> 01:11:51.416
Melanie:
She always said, "If there was
a show I'd ever go on,

01:11:51.417 --> 01:11:52.549
it would be 'The Voice, '"

01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:54.882

come true.

01:11:54.883 --> 01:11:56.382
We're just really proud

01:11:56.383 --> 01:11:59.416
and happy that we can be
all with her

01:11:59.417 --> 01:12:00.617

Here she comes.

Aaliyah:
For my blind audition, I'm

01:21:50.917 --> 01:21:53.816
and still not falter,
you know, with strength

01:21:53.817 --> 01:21:55.616
and with tone
and with roundness.

01:21:55.617 --> 01:21:58.416
I would just love to sing
with you right up in that area,

01:21:58.417 --> 01:21:59.949
right up there,
me and you.

01:21:59.950 --> 01:22:01.416
That sounds fun.

01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:03.416
There's nobody like you
on my team, for sure,

01:22:03.417 --> 01:22:04.582
and I'd love for you

01:22:04.583 --> 01:22:06.782
to just singularly be
in your own zone,

01:22:06.783 --> 01:22:08.149
bringing the light.

01:22:08.150 --> 01:22:09.549
Thank you very much.

01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:11.216
[Applause]

01:22:11.217 --> 01:22:13.749
I also love the '90s.

01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:15.682
[Laughter]

01:22:15.683 --> 01:22:18.749
Garth Brooks, George Strait,
Reba McEntire.

01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:20.982
Diamond Rio,
Brooks and Dunn.

01:22:20.983 --> 01:22:22.549
Yeah.

01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:24.282
Thanks for y'all's support.

01:22:24.283 --> 01:22:26.182
[Laughter]

01:22:26.183 --> 01:22:29.549
I'm also a fan
of rock music,

01:22:29.550 --> 01:22:30.916
and no, it's not what I do,

01:22:30.917 --> 01:22:33.082
but it's not about
what I do as an artist.

01:22:33.083 --> 01:22:34.849
It's about what I do
as a coach.

01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:36.316
I did used to have hair

01:22:36.317 --> 01:22:38.816
very similar to that, too,
by the way.

01:22:38.817 --> 01:22:40.416
And all those bands
y'all were talkin' about,

01:22:40.417 --> 01:22:41.316
they're my favorites, too.

01:22:41.317 --> 01:22:42.516
Ha!

01:22:42.517 --> 01:22:45.182
I love both of the Durans.

01:22:45.183 --> 01:22:46.982
[Laughter]

01:22:46.983 --> 01:22:47.782
Wow.

01:22:47.783 --> 01:22:48.949
Gwen: Hi, Josh.

01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:51.049
I'm almost positive
that I love your voice

01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:52.882
more than any of these
other coaches.

01:22:52.883 --> 01:22:53.882
Debatable.

01:22:53.883 --> 01:22:54.949
It's the kind of thing

01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:56.849
I would listen to
outside of this show.

01:22:56.850 --> 01:22:59.349
I did hang out in the '90s,
as well,

01:22:59.350 --> 01:23:01.816
so one thing
that I could offer you

01:23:01.817 --> 01:23:04.282
is just advice
about being onstage,

01:23:04.283 --> 01:23:07.649
commanding an audience,
how you present yourself.

01:23:07.650 --> 01:23:09.649
I want to keep talking
'cause I want you to understand

01:23:09.650 --> 01:23:11.916
how much I love your voice.

01:23:11.917 --> 01:23:13.116
Thank you very much.

01:23:13.117 --> 01:23:14.616
[Applause]

01:23:14.617 --> 01:23:16.316
Who's it gonna be, Josh?
Come on.

01:23:16.317 --> 01:23:18.949
[Audience shouting]

01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:21.483
Come on.
Come on, man.

01:23:24.083 --> 01:23:25.283
Come on, Josh!

01:23:28.217 --> 01:23:30.050
Come on.

01:23:31.050 --> 01:23:32.482
I pick Adam!

01:23:32.483 --> 01:23:34.649
Yeah, that's right!

01:23:34.650 --> 01:23:36.150
Unh!

01:23:36.817 --> 01:23:38.616
I'm so pumped, dude.
Come on.

01:23:38.617 --> 01:23:40.049
Adam: Josh is so good.

01:23:40.050 --> 01:23:42.616
If you could see what I looked
like when I was that age...

01:23:42.617 --> 01:23:44.449
It was like talking
to a young me.

01:23:44.450 --> 01:23:48.349
Josh: I picked Adam because
we like the same music.

01:23:48.350 --> 01:23:51.549
We both have high voices,
and he knows the music business,

01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:54.282
and he can teach me
how to get myself out there.

01:23:54.283 --> 01:23:55.582
It's cool to meet someone

01:23:55.583 --> 01:23:58.116
that you feel like you got
so much in common with.

01:23:58.117 --> 01:23:59.682
I know
where you want to go.

01:23:59.683 --> 01:24:02.349
Alicia:
That was nice, Adam.

01:24:02.350 --> 01:24:04.382
That was nice, dude.

01:24:04.383 --> 01:24:06.282
That was a nice addition.

01:24:06.283 --> 01:24:09.016
Adam: It was like talking
to myself when I was that age,

01:24:09.017 --> 01:24:11.349
except he's more talented
and has better hair.

01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:13.606
[Laughs]
