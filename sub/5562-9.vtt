WEBVTT

00:05.438 --> 00:07.504
(distant siren wailing)

00:20.685 --> 00:23.218
(pulsing rap music approaches)

00:26.156 --> 00:27.655
Hey.

00:27.657 --> 00:28.622
Hey!

00:28.624 --> 00:29.656
Mr. Prius!

00:29.658 --> 00:31.257
Hey, I need to
talk to you.

00:33.361 --> 00:35.427
Roll down your
window, homes.

00:35.429 --> 00:37.295
I know you can
hear me, man.

00:39.399 --> 00:42.066
Nothing?

00:42.068 --> 00:44.301
Seriously?

00:44.303 --> 00:46.436
I look that scary to you?

00:47.372 --> 00:48.371
(scoffs)

00:48.373 --> 00:51.307
(tires screeching)

00:56.180 --> 00:58.747
(chuckles)

00:58.749 --> 01:00.749
Oh, man.

01:00.751 --> 01:03.084
I'm such a jerk.

01:08.491 --> 01:10.557
(tires screeching)

01:21.269 --> 01:24.069
¶ ¶

01:47.727 --> 01:49.293
No deeks, huh?

01:49.295 --> 01:50.627
No, no deeks.

01:50.629 --> 01:52.629
We finished our workout
half an hour ago,

01:52.631 --> 01:54.631
And he's still
getting ready.

01:54.633 --> 01:56.165
Don't ask.

01:56.167 --> 01:57.166
Where's sam?

01:57.168 --> 01:58.200
Still hitting
the heavy bag.

01:58.202 --> 01:59.201
Don't ask.

01:59.203 --> 02:01.236
All right.

02:03.306 --> 02:04.638
It's kind of nice.

02:04.640 --> 02:06.172
(clears throat)

02:06.174 --> 02:08.174
It's peaceful, quiet.

02:08.176 --> 02:09.608
Even a little zen.

02:12.746 --> 02:14.445
What?

02:14.447 --> 02:16.113
(chuckles)

02:16.115 --> 02:18.782
There's nothing zen
about your desk.

02:18.784 --> 02:20.517
What do you have
against my desk?

02:22.554 --> 02:24.486
Let's see.

02:27.424 --> 02:29.424
I feel you, I hear you.

02:29.426 --> 02:31.225
Sorry.

02:35.197 --> 02:36.729
Kensi?
Yeah.

02:38.466 --> 02:40.332
You have a problem.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.666
I don't have a problem.

02:41.668 --> 02:42.767
Do you prefer sickness?

02:42.769 --> 02:44.301
No.
Disease?

02:44.303 --> 02:46.336
Okay, I will work on it.

02:46.338 --> 02:50.139
And I promise I will keep
to my side of the line.

02:50.141 --> 02:54.209
Well, I decided to
get you... A gift.

02:54.211 --> 02:56.311
Kensi:<i> Scrubbed house,</i>
<i> scrubbed soul?</i>

02:56.313 --> 02:58.479
You think I need
a self-help book?

02:58.481 --> 02:59.613
No. No, you are way
beyond self-help.

02:59.615 --> 03:02.749
You need professional
assistance.

03:02.751 --> 03:04.350
Oh, that's absurd.

03:04.352 --> 03:06.352
No, that is a<i> new york</i>
<i> times</i> best seller.

03:06.354 --> 03:07.720
Millions of people
can't be wrong.

03:07.722 --> 03:08.754
Oh, come on.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.822
This whole mess...

03:10.824 --> 03:12.590
Is about depression.

03:12.592 --> 03:13.757
I am not depressed.

03:13.759 --> 03:15.291
The book says...

03:15.293 --> 03:16.425
That you need to
surround yourself

03:16.427 --> 03:19.527
With things that
inspire happiness.

03:22.632 --> 03:24.164
Okay.

03:24.166 --> 03:25.498
Okay, I got your number.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.116
I know what this is about.

03:27.117 --> 03:28.733
Your pathological
obsession with clutter?

03:28.736 --> 03:30.569
No, not at all,
this is about your issues.

03:30.571 --> 03:32.370
Mine?
Yes.

03:32.372 --> 03:33.504
Really?

03:33.506 --> 03:35.839
Callen, you're no more
organized than I am.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.674
You just don't
have any stuff.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.142
(chuckles)

03:39.143 --> 03:40.609
My stuff symbolizes
that which you lack.

03:40.612 --> 03:42.878
That's why you can't commit
to a serious relationship.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.412
Really?

03:44.414 --> 03:45.413
Mm-hmm.

03:45.415 --> 03:46.881
Oh. Okay.

03:46.883 --> 03:48.782
Uh, what about joelle?

03:48.784 --> 03:50.884
I'm sorry, is that serious?

03:50.886 --> 03:52.585
No, I didn't think so.

03:52.587 --> 03:54.887
Yeah, 'cause you couldn't
commit to a coffee mug.

03:54.889 --> 03:56.455
Wow.

03:56.457 --> 03:59.458
Well, at least you're
not defensive about it.

03:59.460 --> 04:01.660
Defe...?

04:01.662 --> 04:04.262
Wait a minute, did deeks
put you up to this?

04:05.965 --> 04:08.966
Even deeks doesn't take
30 minutes to dry his hair.

04:08.968 --> 04:10.701
Oh, oh...

04:10.703 --> 04:13.370
I'm-I'm going to declutter
his nose from his face.

04:13.372 --> 04:15.705
Nope, not
defensive at all.

04:15.707 --> 04:17.373
(saxophone playing off-key)

04:22.413 --> 04:25.580
Just posted an alternate version
of that on youtube.

04:25.582 --> 04:27.615
12 hits and counting.
(clicks tongue)

04:27.617 --> 04:30.784
Sounded like
a... Saxophone.

04:30.786 --> 04:32.318
Callen...

04:32.320 --> 04:33.619
Thank you so much.

04:33.621 --> 04:36.521
Um, there's a case
up in ops.

04:36.523 --> 04:37.922
Uh, sam and deeks
are already up there.

04:37.924 --> 04:39.590
I'll (clicks tongue)
play you in.

04:39.592 --> 04:41.625
One, two,
three, hey!

04:41.627 --> 04:44.227
(saxophone playing off-key)

04:49.434 --> 04:51.500
¶ ¶

04:52.569 --> 04:55.570
Kensi:
<i> That</i> inspires happiness.

04:55.572 --> 04:57.305
(chuckles)

04:59.742 --> 05:02.342
Eric: One dead body
and one coma victim

05:02.344 --> 05:04.344
From a car accident
this morning.

05:04.346 --> 05:07.814
Pedro gomez killed
lucas belridge, a cpa,

05:07.816 --> 05:11.350
When gomez plowed his delivery
truck into belridge's prius.

05:11.352 --> 05:13.418
What did lapd find
on the truck?

05:13.420 --> 05:14.752
Uh, pastries.

05:14.754 --> 05:16.671
Mostly muffins.

05:16.672 --> 05:18.589
Pedro gomez was also
an undocumented worker,

05:18.591 --> 05:20.791
But that's not why you're
here this morning.

05:20.793 --> 05:21.992
Isn't that across the street

05:21.994 --> 05:24.495
From the naval
recruitment center?

05:24.496 --> 05:26.997
Surprisingly observant, but
also not why you're here.

05:26.999 --> 05:29.532
You're here because
lapd found this note

05:29.534 --> 05:30.699
In belridge's prius.

05:30.701 --> 05:32.701
Deeks: "luck mon
bod roll dean."

05:32.703 --> 05:35.370
Kensi:
And "96 sky."

05:35.372 --> 05:39.374
Please tell me we have
more than just this to go on.

05:39.376 --> 05:42.543
It's the phonetic spelling
of luqman badr al din.

05:42.545 --> 05:44.678
Oh, boy.

05:44.679 --> 05:46.812
Nell: One of the lapd officers
to respond to the scene

05:46.815 --> 05:48.748
Was also a former marine
and linguistic specialist.

05:48.750 --> 05:51.484
Before he was
discharged,

05:51.486 --> 05:54.487
He helped the cia identify
badr al din.

05:54.489 --> 05:56.555
What, so somebody
just looked him up online?

05:56.557 --> 05:59.391
Kensi: Oh, no, this guy's
name's been suppressed.

05:59.393 --> 06:00.925
Even the cia didn't know who
he was until a few months ago.

06:00.927 --> 06:03.527
And yet
here we are.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.295
If it wasn't the press
and it wasn't a mole,

06:05.297 --> 06:08.731
It seems badr al din may
have friends in los angeles.

06:08.733 --> 06:10.733
We need to find out
how belridge figures into this,

06:10.735 --> 06:12.735
Talk to his family and friends,
gather some intel.

06:12.737 --> 06:15.471
His wife's already
waiting in the boatshed.

06:15.473 --> 06:17.372
Right, that's us.
On it.

06:18.308 --> 06:20.474
Is that car in the impound yard?

06:20.476 --> 06:22.876
Uh, yeah, I'll let lapd
know you're coming.

06:25.413 --> 06:27.579
Granger:
Chin up, you two.

06:27.581 --> 06:29.947
Think of where we'd be if gomez
had been a better driver.

06:33.519 --> 06:34.951
(sighs)

06:34.953 --> 06:35.918
(door closes)

06:35.920 --> 06:37.452
Thank you.
Thanks, tim.

06:37.454 --> 06:38.619
(clears throat)
mrs. Belridge.

06:38.621 --> 06:39.953
I'm ncis agent blye.

06:39.955 --> 06:42.822
This is my partner,
lapd detective deeks.

06:42.824 --> 06:44.924
We're so sorry
for your loss.

06:44.926 --> 06:46.358
Deeks: Can I get
you anything?

06:46.360 --> 06:47.992
You want any coffee
or tea or...?

06:47.994 --> 06:49.827
Tissues.

06:49.829 --> 06:51.829
I already went through
everything you had.

06:51.831 --> 06:53.430
Of course.

06:55.967 --> 06:58.834
Do you know why
you're here?

06:58.836 --> 07:00.869
Lucas isn't a terrorist.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.674
Listen, I know this is
all happening very fast,

07:06.676 --> 07:08.676
Um...

07:08.678 --> 07:10.344
But we got to ask
you some questions.

07:10.346 --> 07:11.545
Is that okay?

07:11.547 --> 07:12.979
Mm.

07:12.981 --> 07:18.016
Did you notice any changes
with lucas recently?

07:18.018 --> 07:20.385
What kind of changes?

07:20.387 --> 07:22.854
Was he doing things
he normally doesn't do

07:22.856 --> 07:25.590
Or saying things he
normally doesn't say?

07:27.894 --> 07:30.895
Lucas thought he was getting
a big promotion at work,

07:30.897 --> 07:32.897
And instead he got fired.

07:32.899 --> 07:35.366
And when did that happen?

07:35.368 --> 07:37.568
Two months ago.

07:37.570 --> 07:40.003
He was a wreck.

07:40.005 --> 07:42.538
Depressed and unhappy.

07:42.540 --> 07:45.440
He never wanted to have sex.

07:45.442 --> 07:46.908
I'm sorry,
am I allowed to say that?

07:46.910 --> 07:49.944
If you think
it's important, yeah.

07:49.946 --> 07:52.413
Deeks:
It's okay.

07:52.415 --> 07:55.048
Um, do you know
why he was fired?

07:57.018 --> 07:59.952
Because he didn't want
to cheat on me.

07:59.954 --> 08:02.754
Um... His boss,

08:02.756 --> 08:05.089
Stephanie,
kept making advances,

08:05.091 --> 08:08.092
And when lucas said no,
she fired him.

08:08.094 --> 08:11.528
Mrs. Belridge, is there
something you're not telling us?

08:12.931 --> 08:15.865
He was spending nights out.

08:17.835 --> 08:20.669
He'd say he was playing
poker or basketball

08:20.671 --> 08:23.137
And not to wait up, but then
he'd be gone all night long.

08:26.876 --> 08:28.942
Is this his handwriting?

08:29.945 --> 08:31.945
No.

08:31.947 --> 08:33.079
You're sure?

08:34.649 --> 08:36.115
Lucas's handwriting
was so messy,

08:36.117 --> 08:37.716
You couldn't read it.

08:39.486 --> 08:41.853
Does this mean
he's not a terrorist?

08:41.855 --> 08:44.988
We're trying to figure that out.

08:46.958 --> 08:49.825
Man:
Checked that one in already.

08:49.827 --> 08:53.028
Woman (over p.A.):
Number 5993 is ready.

08:53.030 --> 08:55.030
Number 5993 is ready.
Hey, guys.

08:55.032 --> 08:58.033
Self-help book's a pretty
bold move for a gift.

08:58.035 --> 09:00.135
Do you know how many times
I've showed up in the morning

09:00.137 --> 09:03.204
To find kensi's trash
all over my side of the line?

09:03.206 --> 09:05.072
But it's still
not a gift.

09:05.074 --> 09:08.041
I paid cash for something,
I gave that something to kensi.

09:08.043 --> 09:09.776
That is a gift.

09:09.778 --> 09:11.210
Yeah, it's a gift,
all right, for you.

09:11.212 --> 09:13.212
You don't care about
inspiring happiness,

09:13.214 --> 09:16.982
You only care about kensi
respecting the line.

09:16.984 --> 09:18.884
Is that such a crime?

09:18.885 --> 09:20.785
I don't know if it's a crime,
but it's a pretty lousy gift.

09:20.787 --> 09:22.787
The book wasn't even
my idea, all right?

09:22.789 --> 09:23.854
Deeks suggested it.

09:23.856 --> 09:25.856
Oh, now you're gonna
pin it on deeks.

09:25.858 --> 09:27.224
G, you're better
than this.

09:27.226 --> 09:29.593
You know what, it's the
last time I help anyone.

09:29.595 --> 09:31.595
No, technically, you were
only helping yourself.

09:31.597 --> 09:33.597
Now, this
is a gift.

09:33.599 --> 09:37.067
I don't want to think about
how many resources the cia spent

09:37.069 --> 09:39.135
Learning badr al din's identity.

09:39.137 --> 09:40.669
I'm guessing a lot.

09:40.671 --> 09:41.970
Yeah, a whole lot.

09:41.972 --> 09:44.639
But this could deliver
him right to our door.

09:44.641 --> 09:46.707
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.A.)

09:53.114 --> 09:54.980
Callen: I've got
nothing back here.

09:54.982 --> 09:56.648
Sam:
Interesting.

09:56.650 --> 09:57.982
One, two...

09:57.984 --> 09:59.650
(shutter clicks)

09:59.652 --> 10:02.051
...Three.
(chuckles)

10:04.688 --> 10:06.220
Check it out.

10:09.792 --> 10:12.259
Impact from the accident
must have knocked them loose.

10:12.261 --> 10:16.062
What is an accountant doing
with three cell phones?

10:30.744 --> 10:33.845
Well, callen, consider this
an early birthday present.

10:33.847 --> 10:36.147
I was able to recover data
from the phones in the prius.

10:36.149 --> 10:38.649
One was used for uber,
the other for lyft,

10:38.651 --> 10:40.283
And the third for grubhub.

10:40.285 --> 10:42.885
Guy was picking up passengers
to make money on the side.

10:42.887 --> 10:45.220
And a little extra cash
by delivering food.

10:45.222 --> 10:47.155
Kensi and deeks
said lucas belridge

10:47.156 --> 10:49.089
Lost his job, and he'd been
spending a lot of nights out.

10:49.092 --> 10:51.859
Maybe the note was left
by one of his passengers.

10:51.861 --> 10:55.229
So what, badr al din has
an umami burger addiction?

10:55.231 --> 10:56.897
Callen:
How many passengers

10:56.898 --> 10:58.564
Or deliveries did belridge make
since he lost his job

10:58.567 --> 11:00.099
Two months ago?
Well, let's see.

11:00.101 --> 11:01.200
Between uber,

11:01.202 --> 11:03.635
Lyft and grubhub,

11:03.637 --> 11:05.837
(scoffs)
way less than 500.

11:05.839 --> 11:07.672
Five hundred?

11:09.175 --> 11:12.942
That is the worst
birthday present ever.

11:15.212 --> 11:18.079
Luqman badr al din.

11:18.081 --> 11:19.947
I'll be honest with you.

11:19.949 --> 11:22.015
My colleagues and I
threw ourselves a party

11:22.017 --> 11:23.716
When we figured out
who this guy was.

11:23.718 --> 11:25.284
And you're the cia.

11:25.286 --> 11:26.685
You guys don't party.

11:26.687 --> 11:27.986
Which tells you
how important he is

11:27.988 --> 11:29.654
Within the isis infrastructure.

11:29.656 --> 11:31.622
What did badr al din do?

11:31.624 --> 11:33.924
From what we gathered,

11:33.926 --> 11:35.825
And based
on his impressive travel

11:35.827 --> 11:37.326
Throughout isis controlled
territory,

11:37.328 --> 11:39.127
We believe he's a recruiter.

11:39.129 --> 11:41.262
An inspiring, charismatic,

11:41.264 --> 11:43.764
Extremely effective recruiter.

11:43.766 --> 11:46.166
So he's the tony robbins
of terrorism.

11:46.168 --> 11:47.333
That's fantastic.

11:47.335 --> 11:48.801
We also think he plays

11:48.803 --> 11:51.904
A key role
in the isis propaganda machine.

11:51.906 --> 11:53.672
Well, they've been known to use
twitter and social media

11:53.674 --> 11:56.141
To paint the islamic state
as some kind of utopia.

11:56.143 --> 11:58.977
And portray its lifestyle
as five-star jihad.

11:58.979 --> 12:00.845
They posted photos
when they reopened

12:00.847 --> 12:02.313
A luxury hotel in mosul.

12:02.315 --> 12:05.849
As I mentioned,
extremely effective recruiting.

12:05.851 --> 12:08.818
And badr al din
is behind all of it.

12:08.820 --> 12:11.720
So you think that they're here
to recruit for their army?

12:11.722 --> 12:13.988
Cia isn't prepared
to answer that.

12:13.990 --> 12:15.189
Well, foreigners
already make up

12:15.191 --> 12:17.157
Half of isis's troops.

12:17.159 --> 12:18.992
4,000 of which are
from western countries.

12:18.994 --> 12:20.893
180 just from the u.S.

12:20.895 --> 12:23.795
We actually don't know
why badr al din is here.

12:23.797 --> 12:25.129
Or even if he is here.

12:25.131 --> 12:28.031
What we do know is he's one
of the organization's

12:28.033 --> 12:29.832
Most powerful weapons,

12:29.834 --> 12:32.768
And this is our biggest lead
on him.

12:40.711 --> 12:42.077
It's an interesting concept,

12:42.079 --> 12:44.379
But I can't see myself
using an uber.

12:44.381 --> 12:46.047
Of course you won't.

12:46.049 --> 12:48.149
I like having my wheels
too much.

12:48.151 --> 12:50.618
Mm-hmm, and you would never
want to give up control.

12:51.354 --> 12:52.686
I'm feeling generous.

12:52.688 --> 12:54.087
I'm gonna let that slide.

12:54.089 --> 12:56.055
Ah, 'cause you know
your partner's right.

12:56.057 --> 12:58.257
Because I'm the bigger man.

12:58.259 --> 13:00.692
Who is big enough to admit
when his partner is right.

13:00.694 --> 13:03.294
Huh. Lucas belridge

13:03.296 --> 13:04.928
Picked up a guy named

13:04.930 --> 13:06.262
Jahmir yacoob yesterday.

13:06.264 --> 13:07.630
He's an importer

13:07.632 --> 13:09.164
Who immigrated from iraq

13:09.166 --> 13:10.665
In 1989.

13:10.667 --> 13:12.667
He would've been there
during saddam's regime.

13:12.669 --> 13:15.403
He was special forces
during saddam's regime.

13:15.405 --> 13:17.171
Where'd lucas drive him?

13:17.173 --> 13:19.840
It says he was picked up
at his house in silver lake,

13:19.842 --> 13:21.708
Dropped off in westchester.

13:21.710 --> 13:22.942
Where?

13:22.944 --> 13:24.810
A bus stop

13:24.812 --> 13:26.678
On 96th street

13:26.680 --> 13:29.414
At the intersection of...

13:29.416 --> 13:31.783
Skyway.

13:31.785 --> 13:33.818
96th and sky.

13:33.820 --> 13:35.019
That's got to be him.

13:35.021 --> 13:37.287
Nell.

13:37.289 --> 13:39.789
Jahmir yacoob,
lucas belridge dropped him off

13:39.791 --> 13:40.890
In westchester this morning.

13:40.892 --> 13:42.403
Find out where he went next.

13:42.404 --> 13:43.915
Where are you guys going?
Sam: His house.

13:43.916 --> 13:45.427
Tell kensi and deeks
to meet us there.
Yep.

13:45.429 --> 13:46.895
Well, that was fast.

13:46.897 --> 13:49.430
That's what we pay them for.

13:49.432 --> 13:53.400
No, I was talking about isis
setting up shop on our soil.

13:53.402 --> 13:56.002
They are resourceful,
I'll give them that.

13:56.004 --> 13:59.939
There's a certain comfort
in knowing the enemy, henrietta.

13:59.941 --> 14:02.875
Nothing about isis
gives me comfort.

14:02.877 --> 14:05.310
With them, all bets are off.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.178
Funny.

14:07.180 --> 14:10.681
That's what everyone says
about you, too.

14:18.390 --> 14:20.223
¶ ¶

14:23.895 --> 14:25.127
Kensi:
Any movement inside the house?

14:25.129 --> 14:26.828
Nothing yet.

14:26.830 --> 14:27.762
Take the front.

14:27.764 --> 14:29.130
Sam and I will go around back.

14:29.132 --> 14:30.930
Callen, wait.
(vehicle approaching)

14:34.168 --> 14:36.001
That's our man.

14:39.006 --> 14:40.371
Move in.

14:43.843 --> 14:44.842
Federal agents!

14:44.844 --> 14:46.376
Kensi:
Down on your knees.

14:46.378 --> 14:47.443
Hands behind your head.

14:47.445 --> 14:48.477
Okay, okay.

14:48.479 --> 14:50.011
Are you jahmir yacoob?

14:50.013 --> 14:51.812
Yes.

14:51.814 --> 14:53.313
Front door!

14:53.315 --> 14:54.314
Police officers!

14:54.316 --> 14:55.181
Identify yourself.

14:55.183 --> 14:57.416
I'm mira yacoob.

14:57.418 --> 15:00.819
That is my husband jahmir,
and this is my youngest, adeela.

15:01.955 --> 15:03.054
Where's the oldest?

15:03.056 --> 15:04.355
Zahra?

15:04.357 --> 15:05.723
W-what do you mean?

15:05.725 --> 15:06.890
That is why I called you
on the 911.

15:06.892 --> 15:08.191
That is why you are here.

15:08.193 --> 15:09.425
Kensi:
We're not lapd.

15:09.427 --> 15:11.059
We're ncis.

15:11.061 --> 15:14.195
But you will help us
find zahra, yes?

15:14.197 --> 15:15.930
What happened to her?

15:15.932 --> 15:19.433
She was taken.

15:36.084 --> 15:37.917
Nell, it's callen.

15:37.919 --> 15:39.818
Look, the only way
any of this makes sense

15:39.820 --> 15:41.519
Is if jahmir yacoob's
daughter zahra

15:41.521 --> 15:43.354
Used his uber account
last night.

15:43.356 --> 15:45.690
That would make sense.

15:45.691 --> 15:48.025
So if zahra was the one dropped
off at 96th street and skyway...

15:48.027 --> 15:51.094
Then a 16-year-old girl
may be our connection to isis.

15:51.096 --> 15:53.096
Why don't you try
and track down her cell phone.

15:53.098 --> 15:55.331
Check in on social media.

15:55.333 --> 15:58.033
Yeah. I'll see if she's visited
any isis propaganda sites

15:58.035 --> 16:00.168
Or posted anything
that gives us her location.

16:00.170 --> 16:01.302
One more thing.

16:01.304 --> 16:03.404
Westchester is
right next to lax.

16:03.406 --> 16:05.806
Find out if she's on any
flight manifests leaving today.

16:05.808 --> 16:07.508
Got it.

16:07.509 --> 16:09.209
Although she could be traveling
under an alias.

16:09.211 --> 16:10.910
Well, zahra would need
to know someone

16:10.912 --> 16:13.512
Who could get her fake papers,
good fake papers.

16:15.048 --> 16:17.081
Have eric check airport
security footage just in case.

16:17.083 --> 16:18.415
Will do.

16:18.417 --> 16:19.700
Oh, and, nell?

16:19.701 --> 16:20.984
Everything
at the speed of light?

16:20.986 --> 16:24.053
That's my girl.

16:31.228 --> 16:32.460
Mira:
That look you just gave him.

16:32.462 --> 16:33.928
What does it mean?

16:33.930 --> 16:37.064
I raised two daughters.

16:37.066 --> 16:40.133
She knows every
look in the book.

16:41.069 --> 16:43.302
Sam:
We have a theory.

16:43.304 --> 16:45.937
Your daughter wasn't kidnapped.

16:45.939 --> 16:47.872
She isn't missing, either.

16:47.874 --> 16:50.407
(sighs)
then where is she?

16:50.409 --> 16:52.976
We think zahra ran away.

16:52.978 --> 16:55.078
(chuckles)
no, kids who run away,

16:55.080 --> 16:56.279
They are unhappy.

16:56.281 --> 16:57.913
They wear too much eye makeup.

16:57.915 --> 16:59.881
That is not zahra.

16:59.883 --> 17:01.949
Jahmir:
We are a close family.

17:01.951 --> 17:04.351
There are no secrets
between us.

17:04.353 --> 17:06.186
Sam:
Mr. Yacoob,

17:06.188 --> 17:09.022
Does zahra have access
to your uber account?

17:09.024 --> 17:11.491
Why do you ask?

17:11.493 --> 17:14.060
Someone ordered a car late
last night from your account.

17:14.062 --> 17:16.062
They traveled from this house
to a bus stop

17:16.064 --> 17:18.130
Near lax.

17:19.933 --> 17:21.265
Is that zahra's handwriting?

17:21.267 --> 17:22.599
Yes, but...

17:22.601 --> 17:24.500
I don't...

17:24.502 --> 17:25.968
I don't understand.

17:25.970 --> 17:27.269
Lax?

17:29.072 --> 17:31.906
Do you have any reason
to believe she supports isis?

17:31.908 --> 17:33.440
Why would you ask

17:33.442 --> 17:35.341
Such a ridiculous question?

17:35.343 --> 17:37.943
None of this is going
to help us

17:37.945 --> 17:38.944
Find our daughter.

17:38.946 --> 17:40.478
There is no truth
to any of it!

17:40.480 --> 17:41.979
(sighs)

17:43.449 --> 17:45.882
Deeks:<i> So what is</i>
<i> your older sister like?</i>

17:45.884 --> 17:48.284
She's pretty. I hope I'm that
pretty one day, but I don't know

17:48.286 --> 17:50.085
If it'll happen.
We have the same eyes,

17:50.087 --> 17:51.619
But I'm not as tall,
and my ears stick out.

17:51.621 --> 17:54.021
That's why I wear my hair down,
because of my ears.

17:54.023 --> 17:55.255
Well, what is she like

17:55.257 --> 17:56.990
In school?

17:56.992 --> 17:58.057
Zahra's cool.

17:58.059 --> 17:59.491
Well, she's almost cool.

17:59.493 --> 18:01.025
What does that mean?

18:01.027 --> 18:03.427
Paul hardy invited her
to his party,

18:03.429 --> 18:05.446
But ruby peng didn't.

18:05.447 --> 18:07.464
Ah, I see, and ruby and zahra
are friends, then?

18:07.466 --> 18:10.600
They were-- they used to play
on varsity volleyball together.

18:10.602 --> 18:12.468
And then ruby dropped out or...

18:12.470 --> 18:14.069
No, she's co-captain this year,

18:14.071 --> 18:16.137
But zahra got demoted to jv.

18:16.139 --> 18:18.038
Oh, was she bummed?

18:18.040 --> 18:19.506
All her friends were
on the team,

18:19.508 --> 18:21.241
And they kind of ditched her
after she was cut.

18:21.243 --> 18:22.542
Girls can be so...

18:22.544 --> 18:24.377
Petty, I know.

18:24.379 --> 18:26.512
Zahra was also super annoying
about the whole thing,

18:26.514 --> 18:29.147
So it made it really hard
to feel bad for her.

18:29.149 --> 18:30.648
Right, right.

18:30.650 --> 18:33.083
All right, anything else
you can think of?

18:33.085 --> 18:35.018
Not really.

18:36.955 --> 18:39.155
Where's this photo from?

18:40.424 --> 18:42.157
When we were at dinner
last month,

18:42.159 --> 18:44.058
A lady came to our table.

18:44.060 --> 18:47.094
She wanted to talk to zahra
about modeling.

18:47.096 --> 18:48.462
Zahra got in contact with her?

18:48.464 --> 18:50.798
Yes.

18:50.799 --> 18:53.133
But all that came of it
was some photo shoot.

18:53.135 --> 18:55.535
I don't think they've spoken
again since then.

18:55.537 --> 18:58.037
Zahra never mentioned
her name again.

18:58.039 --> 18:59.571
Uh, allison,

18:59.573 --> 19:02.106
I think it was.

19:02.108 --> 19:04.341
But it's hardly isis,
is it?

19:07.913 --> 19:10.313
Eric:
Hetty, you're not gonna
like this.

19:12.183 --> 19:14.149
Lay it on me thick, mr. Beale.

19:14.151 --> 19:16.417
(sighs)
we found zahra yacoob.

19:16.419 --> 19:18.085
Is she alive?

19:18.087 --> 19:20.504
That's the good news.

19:20.505 --> 19:22.922
The bad news is she's been
watching isis propaganda videos.

19:22.925 --> 19:25.125
We think she used
a fake passport

19:25.127 --> 19:27.193
To board a flight
to ataturk international

19:27.195 --> 19:29.195
In istanbul this morning.

19:29.197 --> 19:31.163
They're coming for our children.

19:31.165 --> 19:32.230
The videos she's watched

19:32.232 --> 19:34.131
Lead us to believe that zahra

19:34.133 --> 19:36.666
Is going to offer herself
as an isis bride.

19:36.668 --> 19:39.135
We're going to stop it.

19:39.137 --> 19:40.936
I need you to get in touch

19:40.938 --> 19:42.437
With turkish authorities.

19:42.439 --> 19:45.440
Tell them to meet her
at the gate.

19:45.442 --> 19:47.508
Yeah.

19:48.444 --> 19:50.510
(sighs)

19:55.049 --> 19:56.548
(line ringing)

19:56.550 --> 19:58.283
Callen:
Yeah, hetty?

19:58.285 --> 20:00.652
Mr. Callen, I need you

20:00.654 --> 20:03.021
To break some unfortunate news

20:03.023 --> 20:06.090
To zahra's parents.

20:06.092 --> 20:08.158
I'm so sorry.

20:12.230 --> 20:14.296
What do you think?

20:16.233 --> 20:18.166
No one's punched
or broken anything yet.

20:18.168 --> 20:21.369
I think they're handling it
pretty well, considering.

20:21.371 --> 20:25.439
Nell said zahra was
watching isis videos.

20:25.441 --> 20:28.141
They need to brainwash
more than just men and boys

20:28.143 --> 20:30.243
If they want to win
the holy war.

20:30.245 --> 20:32.178
And breed the next generation
of jihadists.

20:34.048 --> 20:35.647
Hey, so the dad checked
the safe.

20:35.649 --> 20:38.082
Jewelry, silver,
it's all still there.

20:38.084 --> 20:39.249
Eric accessed the
family's bank account.

20:39.251 --> 20:40.550
Nothing's been touched.

20:40.552 --> 20:43.085
So someone secured papers
for zahra

20:43.087 --> 20:45.220
And paid for her plane ticket
to turkey.

20:45.222 --> 20:47.188
Badr al din?

20:47.190 --> 20:50.157
Pretty 16-year-old girls aren't
exactly in his wheelhouse.

20:50.159 --> 20:51.592
Kensi: Yeah, but
he's got to have

20:51.593 --> 20:53.026
Some contact here,
somebody who's been targeting

20:53.028 --> 20:54.260
Young women.

20:56.530 --> 20:58.630
The modeling agency.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.164
Deeks:
Flaunting one's beauty?

21:00.166 --> 21:01.399
I mean, isn't that

21:01.400 --> 21:02.633
The exact opposite of
being an isis bride?

21:02.635 --> 21:04.101
Unless they weren't
grooming zahra

21:04.103 --> 21:05.735
For a career in front
of the camera.

21:05.737 --> 21:08.003
If you want
to get to know zahra

21:08.005 --> 21:09.270
And young women like her...

21:09.272 --> 21:11.338
And see which one
takes the bait.

21:22.483 --> 21:23.615
What do we know about
the modeling agency

21:23.617 --> 21:25.350
That recruited zahra?

21:25.351 --> 21:27.084
Uh, I looked into the founder,
allison nelson,

21:27.087 --> 21:28.719
The cfo, andrew kim,

21:28.721 --> 21:30.053
And the photographer,
perry gaffney,

21:30.055 --> 21:32.255
As well as the models.

21:32.256 --> 21:34.456
Nothing screams or even whispers
isis sympathy.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.559
This agency's the black hole
in zahra's life.

21:36.561 --> 21:38.093
This could be
the reason she got on

21:38.095 --> 21:39.427
That plane to
istanbul this morning.

21:39.429 --> 21:41.295
Uh, there is
one other thing.

21:41.297 --> 21:42.763
They charge their clients
steep commissions

21:42.765 --> 21:45.232
And are constantly
hosting fund-raisers.

21:45.234 --> 21:46.566
Kensi:
That's odd.
I've seen zahra's head shots,

21:46.568 --> 21:48.668
And the pixilation
and printing quality

21:48.670 --> 21:50.202
Is at least ten years old.

21:50.204 --> 21:51.670
Well, then,
we should follow the money.

21:51.672 --> 21:52.671
If it's not going
back in the business,

21:52.673 --> 21:53.738
It's going somewhere.

21:54.741 --> 21:56.507
All right, I'm on it.

21:56.509 --> 21:58.609
We need to get
inside this agency,

21:58.611 --> 22:00.177
Find out how the
organization works,

22:00.179 --> 22:01.711
What their connections
are to isis.

22:01.713 --> 22:04.146
All right, I'll do it.
Deeks:
What?

22:04.148 --> 22:05.380
No. This is
a democracy.

22:05.382 --> 22:06.547
This is a free world.

22:06.549 --> 22:08.515
Why can't we send
a male model undercover?

22:08.517 --> 22:09.649
That's a good idea, deeks.

22:09.651 --> 22:10.616
Thank you.

22:10.618 --> 22:12.618
Sam? You up for it?

22:12.620 --> 22:13.619
What? No.

22:13.620 --> 22:14.619
They don't make
italian clothes

22:14.622 --> 22:15.787
In this man's size.

22:15.789 --> 22:17.588
Kens, you're up.

22:17.590 --> 22:18.622
Okay.

22:18.624 --> 22:19.723
Okay, well, I'd just
like to say

22:19.725 --> 22:20.824
That I'm doing this
under protest.

22:20.826 --> 22:22.692
But if you are gonna
get dressed up

22:22.694 --> 22:24.660
For this, I have some
very specific ideas

22:24.662 --> 22:26.528
Of what you should wear.
Let me stop you right there.

22:26.530 --> 22:27.762
Okay?
As payback

22:27.764 --> 22:29.230
For that gift you sent me,

22:29.232 --> 22:30.731
That ridiculous book,

22:30.733 --> 22:31.832
You're gonna spend

22:31.834 --> 22:33.633
Some time in
the shooting range. Yeah.

22:33.635 --> 22:36.335
Oh, I don't know what you're
talking about, fickle mistress.

22:39.506 --> 22:40.571
What's on your mind?

22:43.142 --> 22:45.408
We know isis
is recruiting young women.

22:45.410 --> 22:47.443
We think zahra got on a plane
this morning

22:47.445 --> 22:49.778
To offer herself up as a bride.

22:49.780 --> 22:52.313
What we don't know is how many
other girls left today.

22:52.315 --> 22:53.480
Yeah.

22:53.482 --> 22:55.415
I'll have eric and nell
check with lapd,

22:55.417 --> 22:57.083
See if any other girls
have gone missing.

22:57.085 --> 22:59.718
Before it's too late.

22:59.720 --> 23:01.653
Yeah.

23:14.767 --> 23:16.433
Oh! Allow me.

23:17.869 --> 23:19.401
Okay.

23:19.403 --> 23:21.836
Jackie could never get
this kind of a collar

23:21.838 --> 23:23.737
To lie flat, either.

23:25.540 --> 23:28.274
Jackie who? Jackie o?

23:28.276 --> 23:32.144
You ask that as if
there was any other.

23:36.216 --> 23:37.648
Wow.

23:37.650 --> 23:40.117
Jackie o.

23:40.118 --> 23:42.585
She was just 31
when she became first lady.

23:42.588 --> 23:43.820
Think of that.

23:43.822 --> 23:44.821
Oh, well,
I can relate.

23:44.823 --> 23:46.556
I was 31
and building a bookshelf

23:46.558 --> 23:47.723
From ikea for
my studio apartment.

23:47.725 --> 23:49.224
(laughs)

23:51.861 --> 23:53.827
You ready for your undercover?

23:53.829 --> 23:55.728
Yeah, but...

23:55.730 --> 23:57.663
I just don't
understand why zahra,

23:57.665 --> 24:00.732
A young girl, would
want to join isis.

24:00.734 --> 24:03.167
Ms. Blye,

24:03.169 --> 24:05.335
How did you get where you are?

24:05.337 --> 24:07.437
Was it one
big decision,

24:07.439 --> 24:10.239
Or a series of minor ones?

24:10.241 --> 24:11.707
Right.

24:11.709 --> 24:13.508
She's a teenager.

24:13.510 --> 24:14.809
I mean, she's probably
in a place in her life

24:14.811 --> 24:15.810
Where the isis
propaganda

24:15.812 --> 24:17.278
Just tapped into something

24:17.280 --> 24:18.612
Her family didn't
even know existed.

24:18.614 --> 24:20.213
Uh-huh.

24:20.215 --> 24:25.618
We can't assume
to know everyone.

24:27.622 --> 24:30.155
Not even those we're closest to.

24:34.928 --> 24:36.460
(eric sighs)

24:36.462 --> 24:38.261
Gosh.

24:38.263 --> 24:40.529
I had no idea
how many young women

24:40.531 --> 24:42.931
Are reported missing
each week.

24:42.933 --> 24:44.899
I know. It's disturbing.

24:44.901 --> 24:46.867
In other news,
I've been digging into

24:46.869 --> 24:48.869
The modeling
agency's finances.

24:48.871 --> 24:51.304
For all their commissions
and fund-raising,

24:51.306 --> 24:53.606
It looks like they have nothing
in their bank accounts.

24:53.608 --> 24:56.508
They're withdrawing money
as soon as it comes in.

24:56.510 --> 24:58.677
And they only deal in cash,

24:58.678 --> 25:00.845
So it makes their activity
nearly impossible to trace.

25:00.847 --> 25:02.780
Well, everyone
slips up sometime.

25:02.782 --> 25:04.948
Yeah. I'll keep looking.

25:04.950 --> 25:06.215
Oh, hey...

25:06.217 --> 25:07.849
Could you find out
if allison nelson

25:07.851 --> 25:09.650
Or perry gaffney
have been up to

25:09.652 --> 25:11.385
Anything unusual
the past couple weeks?

25:11.387 --> 25:12.853
I would love to help.

25:12.855 --> 25:14.554
Thank you.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.622
¶ ¶

25:30.570 --> 25:31.835
Hi.

25:31.837 --> 25:32.836
Hi.

25:32.838 --> 25:33.837
How can I help you?

25:33.839 --> 25:35.605
My name is azee.

25:35.607 --> 25:37.540
And, um...

25:37.541 --> 25:39.474
Now I'm kind of embarrassed
about being here.

25:39.477 --> 25:41.477
Why? Because you're
a beautiful woman

25:41.479 --> 25:42.811
And you want to get
paid for it?

25:42.813 --> 25:44.879
Absolutely nothing to be
embarrassed about.

25:44.881 --> 25:46.847
Um, have you
ever modeled before?

25:46.849 --> 25:47.881
Oh, no.

25:47.883 --> 25:50.483
Really?
With those cheekbones?

25:50.485 --> 25:51.917
You're telling me

25:51.919 --> 25:53.752
No one has ever tried
to scoop you up?

25:53.754 --> 25:54.853
I mean, in college, maybe,
but I didn't have

25:54.854 --> 25:55.953
The credit card debt
that I have now, so...

25:55.956 --> 25:57.555
Fair enough.

25:57.557 --> 25:58.756
Um, may I?

25:58.758 --> 25:59.823
Sure.

26:02.761 --> 26:04.393
I have a feeling the camera

26:04.395 --> 26:05.761
Is gonna absolutely
love this face.

26:05.763 --> 26:07.262
Thanks.

26:07.264 --> 26:08.429
God, and those legs.

26:08.431 --> 26:09.630
Oh...

26:09.632 --> 26:11.932
Care to test the theory?

26:13.402 --> 26:14.901
I love testing theories.

26:14.903 --> 26:16.469
I'll get perry.

26:16.471 --> 26:17.536
Okay.

26:28.782 --> 26:30.514
Deeks:
Oh.

26:33.418 --> 26:34.817
Uh, kensi,

26:34.819 --> 26:36.952
The agency's cfo, andrew kim,

26:36.954 --> 26:39.554
Just stepped out of the building
looking all kinds of spooky.

26:39.556 --> 26:41.455
Okay, well, stay on him.

26:41.457 --> 26:43.657
You sure you're going
to be okay?

26:43.659 --> 26:44.958
Okay playing barbie?

26:44.960 --> 26:45.959
Yeah, I'll be fine.

26:45.961 --> 26:47.794
Ooh. (laughs)

26:47.796 --> 26:48.961
Uh, definitely not.

26:48.963 --> 26:50.696
Deeks (over earwig):
Sorry, what?

26:50.698 --> 26:51.830
Is that a yes, or is that a no?

26:51.832 --> 26:53.932
No, that's a yes to you,

26:53.934 --> 26:56.267
And a no to
the molly ringwald monstrosity

26:56.269 --> 26:57.735
They just tried to put me in.

26:57.737 --> 27:00.838
(chuckles) you're having fun
with this, aren't you?

27:00.840 --> 27:01.872
No.

27:01.874 --> 27:02.939
Little bit?

27:02.941 --> 27:04.407
It's fine.

27:04.409 --> 27:05.408
I guess.

27:05.410 --> 27:07.543
Ah. Yeah..

27:07.545 --> 27:08.644
I'm a little olive-toned,

27:08.646 --> 27:10.612
So maybe, um, warm tones.

27:10.614 --> 27:12.547
Thank you.

27:12.549 --> 27:14.982
Wow. Warm tones.

27:14.984 --> 27:16.650
You are just full of surprises.

27:16.652 --> 27:18.101
I just know what
looks good on me, okay?

27:18.102 --> 27:19.551
Deeks:
What are you talking about?
You always look good.

27:19.554 --> 27:21.420
It's not gonna work, deeks.

27:21.422 --> 27:22.888
I'm still mad at you
for the book.

27:27.827 --> 27:28.826
What do you got?

27:28.827 --> 27:29.826
Eric:
We compiled
a digital history

27:29.829 --> 27:31.495
Of everything
allison nelson

27:31.497 --> 27:32.929
And photographer
perry gaffney

27:32.931 --> 27:34.797
Did for the last two months.

27:34.799 --> 27:37.299
Nell:
Credit card statements,
driving patterns...

27:37.301 --> 27:38.800
Everything seemed
on the up and up

27:38.802 --> 27:41.302
Until we mapped out which
cell phone towers they used.

27:41.304 --> 27:42.870
Eric:
Twice this month,
nelson dropped gaffney off

27:42.872 --> 27:45.839
A bus stop on
beverly and normandie.

27:45.841 --> 27:47.006
She'd never
done that before?

27:47.008 --> 27:48.540
Never.

27:48.542 --> 27:50.875
What bus did gaffney take?

27:50.877 --> 27:52.610
Both times to grand park,

27:52.612 --> 27:54.511
Most recently,
five days ago,

27:54.513 --> 27:56.679
Where he met up with
this fine fellow.

27:56.681 --> 27:58.914
Name is vignesh mehta.

27:58.916 --> 28:02.017
Fbi suspects him
of forging passports.

28:02.019 --> 28:03.785
This guy probably knows
how many passports they bought.

28:03.787 --> 28:06.487
How many young girls are headed
for the surprise of their lives.

28:06.489 --> 28:08.489
Where is mehta now?

28:08.491 --> 28:09.690
Eric:
Same park,

28:09.692 --> 28:11.792
Where he spends
every afternoon

28:11.794 --> 28:12.993
Drinking espresso.

28:23.805 --> 28:24.804
Thanks, man.

28:24.806 --> 28:26.505
Appreciate the shade.

28:26.507 --> 28:27.873
Yeah, the sun can be a killer.

28:27.875 --> 28:29.407
Oh, I apply spf

28:29.409 --> 28:31.642
Every two hours like they say.

28:31.644 --> 28:32.643
Don't worry.

28:32.645 --> 28:33.944
I'm not worried.

28:33.946 --> 28:35.412
Neither am I.

28:36.381 --> 28:37.947
This guy your friend?

28:37.949 --> 28:39.348
No, he's my partner.

28:39.350 --> 28:40.515
He just loves puzzles.

28:40.517 --> 28:41.682
Mm-hmm.

28:41.684 --> 28:43.751
43 across.

28:43.752 --> 28:45.819
Which federal agency
will arrest you first?

28:45.821 --> 28:47.520
Excuse me?

28:47.522 --> 28:49.588
Let me spell it out for you.

28:49.590 --> 28:51.690
N-c-I-s.

28:51.992 --> 28:53.958
Look, man,

28:53.960 --> 28:55.793
I-I don't want any trouble.

28:55.795 --> 28:56.960
Oh, you're way beyond trouble.

28:56.962 --> 28:58.795
Forging passports for isis?

28:58.797 --> 28:59.896
You're looking at

28:59.898 --> 29:00.930
Life in solitary.

29:00.932 --> 29:02.932
Isis?
Is this some kind of joke?

29:02.934 --> 29:05.067
You think we're out here
talking to you for kicks?

29:05.069 --> 29:08.603
I have never done
anything for isis.

29:08.605 --> 29:10.071
I love this country.

29:10.073 --> 29:11.439
Yeah? Then let's see
what you think

29:11.441 --> 29:12.807
Of the federal prison system.
Okay.

29:15.044 --> 29:16.076
What do you want?

29:16.078 --> 29:17.043
Callen:
A number.

29:17.045 --> 29:18.711
How many passports did you make

29:18.713 --> 29:20.545
For perry gaffney last week?

29:23.650 --> 29:25.016
Three.

29:43.135 --> 29:45.535
Deeks:
<i> Where are you going, mr. Cfo?</i>

29:47.972 --> 29:50.172
<i> You wear your guilt</i>
<i> like a cheap suit.</i>

29:50.174 --> 29:51.907
Which is ironic,

29:51.909 --> 29:53.875
'cause I think you're actually
wearing a cheap suit.

29:58.480 --> 30:01.080
<i> Oh. There you go.</i>

30:01.082 --> 30:02.548
<i> Cue act two.</i>

30:05.653 --> 30:07.085
Lapd. Roll down the window.

30:07.087 --> 30:10.121
Lapd!
Roll down the window now!

30:10.123 --> 30:11.722
Can you just give me a second?

30:12.858 --> 30:13.890
Whoa!

30:13.892 --> 30:15.458
(laughing):
Wow.

30:15.460 --> 30:16.959
All right, that's not what...

30:16.961 --> 30:18.126
I was expecting.

30:18.128 --> 30:20.027
Hey, man, was that
really necessary?

30:20.029 --> 30:21.895
Did we break
any law?

30:21.897 --> 30:24.130
Uh, well, technically yes
and definitely yes.

30:24.132 --> 30:25.998
See, andrew?

30:26.000 --> 30:28.834
This is what happens when you're
too cheap to spring for a hotel.

30:28.836 --> 30:30.802
Andrew, the lady brings up
an excellent point.

30:30.804 --> 30:32.870
Do you need
something, officer?

30:32.872 --> 30:33.971
Detective, actually.

30:33.973 --> 30:35.572
No, I'm just, uh...

30:35.574 --> 30:36.739
I'm just keeping the peace here.

30:36.741 --> 30:38.207
You know.
Protecting and serving and...

30:38.209 --> 30:39.575
I want it
on the record

30:39.577 --> 30:41.677
That I asked him to take me

30:41.679 --> 30:43.045
To the beverly wilshire.

30:43.047 --> 30:44.613
Three weeks into the affair,

30:44.615 --> 30:46.748
And this is what
he calls romance.

30:46.750 --> 30:48.182
Wow, three weeks, andrew?
Not too classy.

30:48.184 --> 30:50.017
Beverly wilshire
would've been nice.

30:50.019 --> 30:51.151
Obviously, you guys have
a lot to discuss

30:51.153 --> 30:52.185
So I will, uh, let you carry on.

30:52.187 --> 30:53.719
You tell him
what's up.
I will.

30:53.721 --> 30:55.554
Gook luck,
andrew.

30:55.556 --> 30:57.556
¶ ¶
gaffney:
Okay. Yes.

30:57.558 --> 30:59.491
There we go.
Great.

30:59.493 --> 31:00.992
More shoulder.
There you go.

31:00.994 --> 31:02.626
Chin up...

31:02.628 --> 31:05.461
Just an inch,
little less.

31:06.997 --> 31:08.162
Little more.

31:08.164 --> 31:10.030
Chin up an inch.
There we go.

31:10.032 --> 31:12.198
Okay.

31:12.200 --> 31:13.766
Great.

31:13.768 --> 31:15.200
I think we got it.

31:15.202 --> 31:16.902
Already?

31:16.903 --> 31:18.603
You were definitely
getting into things.

31:18.605 --> 31:20.905
Too much?

31:20.907 --> 31:22.106
Azee, it was perfect.

31:22.108 --> 31:23.974
Go get changed
and we'll talk after.

31:23.976 --> 31:25.008
Okay. Thanks.

31:25.010 --> 31:26.542
You're welcome.

31:26.544 --> 31:28.977
Ah!

31:28.979 --> 31:30.878
Thank you.

31:30.880 --> 31:32.946
Okay.

31:34.649 --> 31:36.081
Hey, perry,
how'd we do?

31:36.083 --> 31:37.015
We got some good ones.

31:37.017 --> 31:38.082
These will
definitely work.

31:38.084 --> 31:39.083
Hmm.

31:39.085 --> 31:41.018
He's gonna love these.

32:05.110 --> 32:06.576
Yeah, look at that one.

32:06.578 --> 32:08.077
Hang on.
Okay.

32:08.079 --> 32:09.545
(indistinct chatter)

32:17.854 --> 32:19.086
Azee?

32:19.088 --> 32:20.854
You look lost.

32:25.093 --> 32:27.126
(both grunting)

32:43.277 --> 32:45.143
(tires screeching)

32:45.145 --> 32:47.111
(grunting)

33:04.129 --> 33:06.929
All right, gaffney, come out,
come out wherever you are.

33:06.931 --> 33:08.897
Turkish authorities
were waiting for zahra

33:08.899 --> 33:10.331
When her flight landed,

33:10.333 --> 33:11.799
But she wasn't on board.

33:11.801 --> 33:13.667
We found footage
of zahra at lax.

33:13.669 --> 33:15.268
Of her going through security.

33:15.270 --> 33:16.569
Maybe she never
got on her flight.

33:16.571 --> 33:17.870
She could've
gotten cold feet,

33:17.872 --> 33:19.171
Maybe got on a
different flight.

33:19.173 --> 33:21.239
All right, let me
pull up the footage again.

33:23.876 --> 33:25.809
There's zahra
going through security.

33:25.811 --> 33:26.876
Nell:
Keep it playing.

33:26.878 --> 33:28.210
There.

33:28.212 --> 33:30.111
Kensi found a
photo of that guy

33:30.113 --> 33:31.812
In allison
nelson's office.

33:31.814 --> 33:34.281
So if zahra's not on her flight,
I bet she's with him.

33:34.283 --> 33:36.283
Find out who he is.

33:36.284 --> 33:38.284
And where are we on those
other two fake passports?

33:38.287 --> 33:40.253
Uh, lapd found photos
on mehta's hard drive.

33:40.255 --> 33:41.887
I ran them through
facial rec.

33:41.889 --> 33:42.888
And?

33:42.890 --> 33:44.222
Eric:
They're minors.

33:44.224 --> 33:46.257
We're lucky that they both
have driver's licenses.

33:46.259 --> 33:48.158
Nell:
Rivla and bahrooz.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.926
They're just 16
and 17 years old.

33:49.928 --> 33:52.128
And reported missing
this morning.

33:52.130 --> 33:55.097
Both girls are scheduled to fly
into imam khomeini international

33:55.099 --> 33:57.699
In iran, but not until tomorrow.

33:57.701 --> 33:59.233
Well, zahra might be
joining them on that flight.

33:59.235 --> 34:00.934
Mm.
I'll update hetty.

34:00.936 --> 34:03.136
You two keep
searching for gaffney.

34:03.138 --> 34:05.771
Yeah.
Yeah.

34:10.143 --> 34:12.243
Good afternoon, agents.

34:13.946 --> 34:15.712
You know good manners
isn't gonna change

34:15.714 --> 34:16.979
Where we're sending you,
right?

34:16.981 --> 34:18.880
It doesn't really matter
where you send me.

34:18.882 --> 34:21.015
I'm still not going to talk.

34:21.017 --> 34:22.316
Sam:
Are you waiting
for your lawyer?

34:22.318 --> 34:24.251
You know we can keep you.

34:24.253 --> 34:26.152
No, I don't need
a lawyer, either.

34:26.154 --> 34:28.287
I'm just not gonna cooperate.

34:28.289 --> 34:29.955
Well, we'll see about that.

34:31.758 --> 34:34.658
Born and raised
in arizona.

34:34.660 --> 34:36.860
Dropped out of arizona state
to become a receptionist

34:36.862 --> 34:39.195
At daddy's office.

34:39.197 --> 34:41.697
Moved to l.A. In 2012.

34:41.699 --> 34:43.398
Says here you don't
have a passport.

34:43.400 --> 34:45.299
So?

34:45.301 --> 34:47.200
Have you ever been
to the middle east?

34:48.169 --> 34:50.335
I went to tijuana once.

34:50.337 --> 34:51.869
But you have
no problem

34:51.871 --> 34:53.770
Taking young girls
from their families,

34:53.772 --> 34:55.838
Sending them halfway
around the world

34:55.840 --> 34:57.172
To a place you've never been

34:57.174 --> 34:59.240
To marry terrorists?

34:59.242 --> 35:01.375
(quiet laugh)
so typical.

35:01.377 --> 35:04.710
You label anyone you don't
understand as a terrorist.

35:06.313 --> 35:09.380
Your boyfriend there
is faraz hadi.

35:09.382 --> 35:12.349
He was born in
detroit and currently

35:12.351 --> 35:16.286
He is on the fbi watch list
as a suspected isis fighter.

35:18.857 --> 35:22.257
The islamic state
is not what you think it is.

35:24.194 --> 35:26.194
These girls
are gonna be sold,

35:26.196 --> 35:28.329
Whipped,

35:28.331 --> 35:31.198
Stoned to death.

35:31.200 --> 35:32.999
Then they must
have done something

35:33.001 --> 35:34.734
To deserve that punishment.

35:36.304 --> 35:37.269
I can only
guide these girls

35:37.271 --> 35:39.337
Towards a more righteous path.

35:39.339 --> 35:42.273
What happens after that
is on them.

35:59.725 --> 36:01.691
There's gaffney's car.

36:01.693 --> 36:04.726
Right where eric
said it would be.

36:07.097 --> 36:08.396
He's about to come back.

36:08.398 --> 36:09.463
His time's running out.

36:09.465 --> 36:11.364
Ah, points for the
double entendre.

36:11.366 --> 36:13.332
It's only a double entendre
if the second meaning is risqué.

36:13.334 --> 36:14.933
Well, that's not
necessarily true.

36:14.935 --> 36:16.367
It's a french word meaning
"double understanding."

36:16.369 --> 36:17.869
I don't know why you have
to be sexualize everything.

36:17.870 --> 36:19.370
Guys, guys, guys.
What do you
know about french?

36:19.372 --> 36:20.738
Time out, all right?

36:20.740 --> 36:22.339
I'm not listening to
another touché debate.

36:27.045 --> 36:29.712
Guys, over there.

36:31.248 --> 36:33.447
He's with rivla
and bahrooz.

36:36.351 --> 36:38.084
Stay with the girls.
Got it.
Yep.

36:47.227 --> 36:49.727
Bahrooz, rivla?

36:49.729 --> 36:52.262
I'm special agent kensi blye
with ncis.

36:52.264 --> 36:54.397
What's going
to happen to perry?

36:54.399 --> 36:56.232
You're not in trouble,
but you need to come home now.

36:56.234 --> 36:58.300
I'm not going
anywhere with you.

36:58.302 --> 37:00.268
Hey, rivla.

37:00.270 --> 37:01.936
You don't want to get
on that plane tomorrow.

37:01.938 --> 37:02.970
I promise you.

37:02.972 --> 37:04.004
Don't listen to her.

37:04.006 --> 37:05.138
Remember what perry said.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.140
Bahrooz, perry is a liar.

37:07.142 --> 37:09.142
Okay, whatever he
promised you,

37:09.144 --> 37:10.776
It's not true.

37:10.778 --> 37:13.145
Look what happened just now.

37:13.147 --> 37:15.480
Things got intense,
he panicked

37:15.482 --> 37:17.882
And he left you here.

37:17.884 --> 37:21.785
You don't do that to the
people you care about.

37:21.787 --> 37:24.988
Your families would
never do that to you.

37:24.990 --> 37:28.458
It's time to go home.

37:28.460 --> 37:31.393
Okay?

37:34.965 --> 37:37.031
Split up.

37:53.081 --> 37:54.413
(elevator bell dings)

37:54.415 --> 37:57.215
Get back in the elevator!

37:57.217 --> 37:58.482
I'm a federal agent!

37:58.484 --> 38:01.250
Go down to the first floor now!

38:04.054 --> 38:05.386
(gunfire)

38:29.945 --> 38:31.411
(car alarm wailing)

38:35.316 --> 38:36.515
Callen:
I got gaffney!

38:42.255 --> 38:44.154
(gasping)

38:44.156 --> 38:45.121
Zahra?

38:45.123 --> 38:46.489
Come on, zahra.

38:46.491 --> 38:48.157
It's gonna be okay, come on.

38:48.159 --> 38:50.058
Come on.

38:50.060 --> 38:51.325
It's over.

38:54.096 --> 38:55.328
Who are you?

38:55.330 --> 38:56.896
Callen: We're federal
agents. You're safe.

38:56.898 --> 38:59.131
What's gonna happen?

39:00.567 --> 39:03.367
We're gonna get you home.

39:03.369 --> 39:05.435
(crying)

39:11.342 --> 39:13.408
(indistinct radio transmission)

39:15.278 --> 39:17.411
(indistinct conversations)

39:17.413 --> 39:19.112
Zahra!

39:19.114 --> 39:20.346
(speaks indistinctly)

39:24.251 --> 39:25.483
We did a good thing today.

39:25.485 --> 39:28.853
Yeah, and, you, kensi,

39:28.855 --> 39:30.421
You were amazing
with those girls.

39:30.423 --> 39:32.189
Thank you.

39:32.191 --> 39:33.757
Crazy.

39:33.758 --> 39:35.324
We would've never found out
about this case

39:35.327 --> 39:37.093
If it wasn't for that note.

39:37.095 --> 39:39.095
Kensi:
And zahra only wrote
badr al din's name

39:39.097 --> 39:41.063
Because she forgot
how to pronounce it.

39:41.065 --> 39:44.266
That's a lucky break.

39:44.268 --> 39:46.568
Yeah, but he's still out there.

39:46.570 --> 39:48.970
Glorifying isis.

39:48.972 --> 39:52.506
Building its army
one by one by one.

39:52.508 --> 39:54.474
Not today.

39:56.311 --> 39:58.210
You bet your
bottom dollar.

39:58.212 --> 39:59.978
What, and tomorrow
there'll be sun?

39:59.980 --> 40:01.412
Are you quoting
musicals to me now?

40:01.414 --> 40:03.213
Well, yeah, I just love
that you know that.

40:03.215 --> 40:05.081
Oh, we were
having a moment.

40:05.083 --> 40:08.284
Deeks:
No, no, no, we are still
having a moment.

40:08.286 --> 40:10.185
All I'm saying is we're in sync,
and you cannot deny that.

40:10.187 --> 40:11.837
Oh, I can and I will.

40:11.838 --> 40:13.488
I just think you have a thing
for redheads with daddy issues.

40:13.490 --> 40:16.090
(laughs)
deeks?

40:17.660 --> 40:19.292
Martin deeks?

40:19.294 --> 40:20.559
Yeah, what's up?

40:20.561 --> 40:22.460
Put your hands behind your head.

40:22.462 --> 40:24.995
What?

40:24.997 --> 40:26.997
You're being arrested
for the murder of francis boyle.

40:29.301 --> 40:30.566
You have the right
to remain silent.

40:30.568 --> 40:31.567
Anything you say can

40:31.569 --> 40:33.435
And will be used against you

40:33.437 --> 40:34.636
In a court of law.

40:34.638 --> 40:36.504
Deeks, what is he talking about?

40:37.907 --> 40:40.507
I love you.

40:40.509 --> 40:42.141
Detective:
You have the right
to talk to a lawyer.

40:42.143 --> 40:44.243
If you can't afford a lawyer,
one will be appointed for you.

40:44.244 --> 40:46.344
Do you understand these rights
as I have explained them to you?

40:46.347 --> 40:49.181
Whoa... Deeks?

40:55.021 --> 40:58.322
(car engine starts)

40:58.324 --> 41:00.390
(siren wailing)
deeks!
