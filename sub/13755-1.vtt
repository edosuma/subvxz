02:12.370 --> 02:15.322
It's over.

02:18.831 --> 02:21.534
I will always speak to you...

02:22.082 --> 02:25.164
...and I don't mind if
you don't say anything.

02:29.376 --> 02:34.248
Just beacuse you went away, it doesn't
mean you're not here anymore.

02:36.837 --> 02:40.583
Perhaps all I ever needed
was this gift.

02:44.214 --> 02:47.747
The one you gave to me at the end.

04:25.416 --> 04:28.617
WOMB

05:41.026 --> 05:44.357
- Shall I read to you?
- No, thanks.

05:47.945 --> 05:51.276
Good night, Grandpa.

06:19.330 --> 06:23.539
Hi! I'm Tommy.
And you?

06:27.166 --> 06:28.991
- Rebecca.

06:30.553 --> 06:32.129
Have you moved here?

06:32.960 --> 06:36.374
No, my grandpa lives here,
I'm staying with him.

07:51.446 --> 07:54.647
Rebecca, your grandfather's on the phone.

07:56.781 --> 08:00.646
She's fallen asleep.
Shall I wake her up?

08:03.491 --> 08:06.398
No. Not at all.
That's fine.

08:06.855 --> 08:08.566
She's welcome to stay tonight.

08:14.162 --> 08:15.915
Good night!

09:19.768 --> 09:22.637
Tell me where we're going.

11:29.688 --> 11:32.640
Up till now, he's only seen
blades of grass before.

11:33.523 --> 11:36.724
It must seem like a
different planet to him.

11:38.274 --> 11:41.688
Tomorrow we'll take him on the beach
and show him the sea.

11:43.484 --> 11:46.981
I won't be here tomorrow.
I'm going away.

11:50.403 --> 11:53.355
Are you going home?

11:55.280 --> 11:58.232
- No.
- Where then?

11:58.906 --> 12:02.107
- To Tokyo.
- Japan?

12:04.450 --> 12:05.912
- What for?
-- My mother was there job.

12:07.501 --> 12:09.759
Mom's got a job there.

12:09.993 --> 12:14.783
- We'll be living on the 72nd floor.
- 72nd?

12:16.829 --> 12:19.911
That's high.

12:21.372 --> 12:24.324
I have to go.

13:02.470 --> 13:06.002
- Hi?
- Rebecca?

13:05.688 --> 13:06.923
Where are you?

13:06.924 --> 13:09.887
On the beach, I came out to look to the storm.

13:11.015 --> 13:15.969
-- When are you going tomorrow?
- I'm leaving at six, on the ferry.

13:17.183 --> 13:21.048
I'll see you off, I've got a good idea.

13:23.185 --> 13:26.268
- Rebecca?
- Yes, I'm here.

13:28.646 --> 13:33.435
Tommy, hello?
Tommy?

14:12.202 --> 14:15.616
It's time, Rebecca.

16:03.449 --> 16:06.982
- Excuse me.
- What can I do for you?

16:08.576 --> 16:12.785
- I've come to see Tommy.
- Oh, he hasn't lived here for a long time.

16:16.871 --> 16:19.823
You look very familiar.
Have I met you somewhere before?

16:20.914 --> 16:23.664
I'm Rebecca.

16:28.124 --> 16:31.906
Rebecca ... The little girl,
that went to Japan?

16:34.918 --> 16:39.494
For a while, Tommy nagged us
about going to Tokyo.

16:41.629 --> 16:44.794
But then he forgot about it, luckily.

16:48.548 --> 16:51.168
Where does he live now?

16:51.799 --> 16:55.581
Do you know the little harbor
down by the embankment?

16:56.759 --> 16:59.593
You'll find him there.

17:13.473 --> 17:16.093
Hello?

17:37.232 --> 17:41.097
Who are you?
What are you doing?

17:43.692 --> 17:47.438
- I am looking for Thomas.
- I'm Thomas.

17:52.112 --> 17:54.945
Who are you?

18:03.908 --> 18:06.860
Hi, Tom.

18:18.288 --> 18:20.907
Hi.

18:21.914 --> 18:24.747
Who is she?

18:28.041 --> 18:30.874
How was Japan?

18:31.626 --> 18:35.039
- Fine.
- 72 th floor.

18:42.588 --> 18:48.704
So, let us like normal people.
I Rous, this volume. And as you name?

18:57.051 --> 19:01.342
- Are you going back?
- No, I finished my degree.

19:01.886 --> 19:04.375
- What did you study?
- Maths.

19:05.179 --> 19:07.668
And now?
What do you do now?

19:08.096 --> 19:11.298
I design software for sonar devices.

19:14.765 --> 19:18.630
Sonar devices that detects tiny cracks
in underground storage tanks.

19:23.852 --> 19:29.684
Like the kind used in petrol stations,
you know they sometimes crack.

19:31.813 --> 19:34.895
Cool.

19:38.815 --> 19:41.767
So Bingo let you come in just like that?

19:42.900 --> 19:45.758
I've never seen him do that,
he hates strangers usually.

19:45.759 --> 19:47.686
Once he bit a girl's thigh,
though it were monthly.

19:50.820 --> 19:54.945
- Maybe he liked your scent.
- Maybe.

19:59.906 --> 20:03.439
Maybe you two just start
sniffing each other?

20:17.412 --> 20:20.613
How many years is it?

20:23.539 --> 20:27.866
- Twelve.
- Twelve.

20:33.293 --> 20:36.576
Maybe I should go.

21:36.189 --> 21:39.058
Does Rose know that you're here?

21:41.608 --> 21:44.560
I don't know.

21:49.777 --> 21:51.915
She is your girlfriend, isn't she?

21:53.610 --> 21:55.142
Girlfriend?

22:03.449 --> 22:07.314
I met her yesterday for
the first time in my life.

22:45.338 --> 22:48.622
How long is is since your
grandfather passed away?

22:51.340 --> 22:54.292
Long time ago.

22:55.925 --> 22:59.126
It's odd.

23:00.635 --> 23:05.923
Seemed bigger in my mind.

23:11.514 --> 23:16.173
Do you remember that night, when
you said you'd see me off because you had an idea...

23:16.808 --> 23:20.340
...and you didn't turn up?

23:22.059 --> 23:25.142
What was your idea, do you remember?

23:28.186 --> 23:31.139
I thought you'd never ask.

23:54.029 --> 23:57.775
I wanted to give him to you that morning.

24:01.156 --> 24:05.945
Tokyo would have been
a great adventure for him.

24:15.536 --> 24:20.195
I fed him, for about a year actually,
after you left.

24:24.289 --> 24:27.490
He managed to eat and shit
at the same time.

24:29.166 --> 24:32.367
Which is impressive.

24:33.459 --> 24:36.209
He looked too good.

24:36.919 --> 24:40.202
And one day, he didn't
appear anymore.

24:43.588 --> 24:46.789
He was dead.

24:50.131 --> 24:52.834
Why didn't you come?

24:54.550 --> 24:57.253
I overslept.

25:00.302 --> 25:03.052
But now I'm awake.

25:40.190 --> 25:43.024
You're cold.

26:18.787 --> 26:20.525
Weird.

26:22.458 --> 26:24.288
I know.

26:26.887 --> 26:28.451
Yeah.

27:19.475 --> 27:23.221
- What are you doing this weekend?
- Same as you.

27:24.560 --> 27:27.263
I can't do it.

27:27.686 --> 27:30.436
- I have to go away.
- I'll come with you.

27:31.396 --> 27:34.809
I have to go alone.
It'll only be two days.

27:35.730 --> 27:38.350
Where were yo go, I go.

27:42.399 --> 27:45.482
This is somewhere you can't go.

27:50.527 --> 27:53.859
Then you shouldn't go either.

28:00.656 --> 28:02.040
They simply drained the marsh...

28:02.041 --> 28:06.169
...and caught it thousands of tons of
reinforced concrete over there.

28:06.199 --> 28:08.299
They built in six months, which is a record.

28:08.300 --> 28:12.944
On paper, it's a wellness center.
They've called it Sparkling Park.

28:13.660 --> 28:17.074
Profit will mainly come from
cyber-prostitution, you know...

28:17.245 --> 28:21.904
...cyber-bitches, the plastic surgery,
cloning of domestic animals.

28:23.455 --> 28:25.326
They opened last week.

28:25.574 --> 28:28.548
This will be their first weekend,
or rather our weekend...

28:28.549 --> 28:30.654
...because our group will
be there too.

28:30.937 --> 28:31.722
Group?

28:31.941 --> 28:36.292
Pollungroup. A militant environmental
activist group.

28:37.085 --> 28:41.827
It will be a planned action,
with 23 participants.

28:42.420 --> 28:45.652
We go inside, we cause
mass hysteria Rebecca...

28:45.653 --> 28:49.577
...I'm telling you, mass hysteria,
thus diverting the security guards.

28:49.578 --> 28:53.394
Now, meanwhile outside, the other guys
were blocked the enterance and...

28:53.395 --> 28:55.881
...exit to the carpark with a quick
setting cement pool.

28:55.883 --> 28:59.723
You know quick-cement?
No? Fine, don't worry about it.

28:59.885 --> 29:04.958
- Anyway, then the media will turn up...
- How do you do that, mass hysteria?

29:24.167 --> 29:25.859
Ready?

29:45.692 --> 29:50.150
You see those rucksacks? We're going to release
the cockroaches from those in the shops.

29:50.861 --> 29:55.069
Around the pools and the restaurants, just
depending on the where the largest crowd are, really.

29:57.988 --> 30:00.940
"Sparkling Park"

30:07.533 --> 30:10.734
I've got six ruckssacks.

30:25.623 --> 30:29.369
- Where are you going? - Away.
- What's all of this you're carrying?

30:30.374 --> 30:32.864
Backpacks.

30:33.081 --> 30:35.956
- Do you want to come in for a coffee?
- No, no, not now.

30:36.432 --> 30:38.187
Well, do I even get a kiss?

30:56.095 --> 31:00.124
- What?
- I love your plan. Did you think it up all by yourself?

31:00.926 --> 31:04.459
A-ha, yeah, of course.

31:06.470 --> 31:07.795
What?

31:08.052 --> 31:12.504
I am but a simple cockroach breeder Rebecca.

31:13.723 --> 31:16.721
I hope that makes me good enough for you.

31:18.099 --> 31:21.929
I've always dreamt of meeting
a cockroach breeder.

31:46.734 --> 31:49.437
I need to pee.

31:51.277 --> 31:54.561
- How badly?
- Badly.

34:00.864 --> 34:06.265
"I will wait for you,
for as long as it takes. "

37:34.854 --> 37:37.520
- I can not eat Rebecca, I'm sorry.
-- At least sit down.

37:37.688 --> 37:40.036
At least sit down.

37:44.191 --> 37:47.024
I can't sit, either.

37:51.110 --> 37:54.275
Would you tell us please
why you invited us here?

37:56.737 --> 37:59.357
Of course.

38:26.997 --> 38:29.700
He could be here with us again.

38:42.128 --> 38:44.961
- Again? Who, Thomas?

39:03.630 --> 39:06.215
Department of Genetic Replication
Consent to Exhumation and Taking of Tissue Samples

39:06.970 --> 39:09.803
Who would give birth to him?

39:23.684 --> 39:26.054
Ralph.

39:33.687 --> 39:35.285
We are atheists...

39:37.004 --> 39:40.311
...and we brought up Thomas
as an atheist.

39:40.815 --> 39:46.576
But that does not mean we could rummage
in our deceased's grave and clone them.

39:47.317 --> 39:50.399
We are not farm animals.

39:52.402 --> 39:55.484
We accept what life gives us...

39:57.154 --> 40:00.300
...and also what it takes away.

40:00.301 --> 40:01.761
But...

40:02.891 --> 40:04.534
But what?

40:11.033 --> 40:14.317
But life has also given us
this opportunity.

40:16.660 --> 40:19.862
This gift.

40:24.830 --> 40:27.912
Don't you see?

40:38.335 --> 40:43.492
If I were you Rebecca,
I would repaint this room white.

40:48.852 --> 40:51.207
Ralph?

41:33.354 --> 41:36.187
Thank you.

41:42.815 --> 41:45.565
Would you like us to move away?

41:47.358 --> 41:50.891
No, stay.

41:53.152 --> 41:57.811
He loved the sea,
he'll love it again.

42:00.071 --> 42:02.852
As for us, there is no way we can stay here.

42:03.513 --> 42:05.095
We're moving next week.

42:06.198 --> 42:08.688
Okay.

42:10.033 --> 42:12.736
Thank you, Ralph.

42:15.702 --> 42:17.044
Rebecca...

42:19.300 --> 42:21.175
...have a good think about it.

42:21.704 --> 42:24.987
You can still change your mind.

43:07.053 --> 43:09.672
Thank you.

46:03.030 --> 46:05.401
- Hi.
- Hello.

46:06.531 --> 46:09.815
- How old is your baby?
- Three months.

46:11.742 --> 46:14.694
Do you want some pie?
Baked it myself.

46:15.201 --> 46:18.070
Thanks, but not now.
I have to go to home.

46:18.494 --> 46:21.908
- Okay.
- Bye. - Bye.

46:30.081 --> 46:33.164
It's alright, baby.

46:46.087 --> 46:48.837
Eat, sweetheart.

46:52.506 --> 46:55.256
It's just us two.

47:26.809 --> 47:29.429
Tommy?

47:30.269 --> 47:32.743
Come out for a bit, I want to tell you something.

47:32.744 --> 47:35.156
- What?
- Come out darling.

47:36.896 --> 47:41.685
I know. I know I'll be going to
primary school and I go on Monday.

47:43.398 --> 47:47.524
Yes, on Monday, you'll go to
primary school. But now come out.

47:48.942 --> 47:52.024
I can see you okay from in here.

48:00.397 --> 48:03.604
I have to speak to you
about your daddy.

48:07.990 --> 48:11.855
Your daddy died in a car
accident before you were born.

48:16.035 --> 48:18.654
- Really?
- Yes.

48:19.536 --> 48:23.531
-- I thought he went back to his home planet.
- His home planet?

48:24.996 --> 48:28.742
- Yes.
- Your father was from this planet.

48:31.665 --> 48:33.221
That's a shame.

48:33.222 --> 48:35.076
Listen Thomas.

48:37.000 --> 48:41.458
Your father was real,
he was a student in biology.

48:43.086 --> 48:45.836
And he was hit by a car.

48:51.047 --> 48:53.999
Do you understand?

49:34.653 --> 49:39.416
A man of words and not of deeds
Is like a garden full of weeds.

49:39.417 --> 49:44.316
And when the weeds begin to grow,
It's like a garden full of snow.

49:44.317 --> 49:49.313
And when the snow begins to fall,
It's like a bird upon the wall.

49:49.314 --> 49:54.364
And when the bird away does fly,
It's like an eagle in the sky.

49:54.366 --> 49:59.418
And when the sky begins to roar,
It's like a lion at the door.

49:59.419 --> 50:04.419
And when the door begins to crack,
It's like a stick across your back.

50:04.420 --> 50:09.655
And when your back begins to smart,
It's like a penknife in your heart.

50:09.656 --> 50:17.031
And when your heart begins to bleed,
you're dead, and dead, and dead indeed...

50:46.212 --> 50:49.413
I keep dying.

50:51.297 --> 50:54.249
Try again.

51:27.267 --> 51:30.101
Mom?

51:36.729 --> 51:40.012
Eric's staying over tonight.

51:42.481 --> 51:45.101
Hi.

51:47.358 --> 51:50.559
Can I get you anything?

52:06.448 --> 52:09.530
Hi, Mom.
Look at that little rabbit.

52:11.699 --> 52:14.983
It's lovely.
What's your name?

52:15.993 --> 52:18.696
I Dima, and that breast.

52:19.536 --> 52:23.400
-- Snow Lump or just Lump?
-- Just Lump.

52:40.918 --> 52:44.783
Well, we're off.
Bye, Tommy, see you.

52:52.297 --> 52:55.331
Wouldn't you like to come and
play at our house Dima?

52:57.799 --> 53:00.632
No, thank you.

53:07.552 --> 53:10.931
- I can smell it. What about you?
- I could.

53:10.932 --> 53:11.975
What did you smell?

53:11.804 --> 53:14.637
- The copy smell.
- What?

53:15.305 --> 53:18.008
Copy smell. Copies have a
weird smell.

53:18.806 --> 53:23.092
- Where did you hear that?
- Oh mom, everyone knows that.

53:23.016 --> 53:27.591
They smell like window cleaner.
It comes from their skin.

53:42.731 --> 53:45.434
So?

53:54.527 --> 53:58.059
Eric says that you invited
little Dima into your home.

53:59.528 --> 54:01.899
Yes.
Why?

54:04.947 --> 54:10.367
Look Rebecca, we don't have any
problem with human repliaction...

54:10.368 --> 54:13.344
...we think that some clones are decent people

54:13.345 --> 54:15.530
they have their own lives and rights...

54:15.826 --> 54:20.035
The thing is, it's too complicated
for our kids.

54:22.203 --> 54:26.413
Now we hear about these things in the news
all the time, but quite frankly...

54:26.413 --> 54:30.574
we do not want our children coming up
against these things first hand.

54:31.123 --> 54:34.157
Neither do you, I suppose.

54:43.877 --> 54:46.662
Dima is the victim of
artificial incest.

54:47.462 --> 54:51.208
Her mother gave birth to her own mother.

54:51.880 --> 54:54.962
Did you know that?

55:00.923 --> 55:05.924
So, if you'd known, you obviously wouldn't
have invited her into your home, would you?

55:16.430 --> 55:19.512
No, of course not.

55:27.559 --> 55:30.428
I'm gonna go now.

55:59.987 --> 56:03.069
Come on Eric.

56:10.837 --> 56:13.327
Come and give me a hand Tommy.

56:14.214 --> 56:17.166
It's your party after all.

56:33.429 --> 56:36.179
Hi.

57:20.361 --> 57:24.771
Molly, it's Rebecca. I just wanted to
make sure you got the invitation?

57:28.406 --> 57:31.275
But he...

57:45.037 --> 57:47.989
I see.

58:07.018 --> 58:09.094
Happy birthday, Tommy.

58:09.095 --> 58:10.137
- But the others aren't...
- There'll just be the two of us, my love.

58:15.255 --> 58:18.208
Two?
But why?

58:21.025 --> 58:26.161
- The others aren't coming.
- Why aren't they coming?

58:31.720 --> 58:34.469
Because of the copy?

58:35.012 --> 58:39.090
But we didn't invite the copy,
we didn't invite her on purpose.

58:43.523 --> 58:48.177
Why aren't they coming mom?
Please?

58:53.936 --> 58:57.349
- Mom!
- Because the mothers...

59:05.301 --> 59:08.135
Their mothers were not allowed.

59:09.104 --> 59:10.900
Why not?

59:11.192 --> 59:15.056
- Because they are stupid.
- Stupid?

01:00:09.628 --> 01:00:12.627
Where we going, Mom?

01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:47.550
This is exactly how I imagined it.

01:00:49.476 --> 01:00:52.558
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

01:00:54.602 --> 01:00:58.016
Cool, it's like the end of the world.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.073
Mom?

01:01:34.991 --> 01:01:38.275
Come quickly.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.912
I thought they were extinct long ago.

01:02:10.045 --> 01:02:12.997
Can I take one home?

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:18.876
Home?
That's where we are, Tommy.

01:03:17.445 --> 01:03:21.433
Tommy?
I'm back.

01:03:26.863 --> 01:03:30.147
You can look.

01:03:43.616 --> 01:03:48.119
- Cool!
- What are you gonna call him?

01:03:51.539 --> 01:03:53.273
I don't know.

01:03:55.188 --> 01:03:57.071
Bingo?

01:03:58.749 --> 01:04:02.163
Bingo?
No.

01:04:08.802 --> 01:04:10.467
Booboo.

01:04:12.425 --> 01:04:15.072
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:04:18.048 --> 01:04:21.331
Thanks, Mom.

01:04:49.475 --> 01:04:52.558
Hi, I'm Mark.

01:04:55.144 --> 01:04:57.977
We are neighbors.

01:05:04.564 --> 01:05:08.227
- Can I see in your binoculars?
- Sure.

01:05:08.982 --> 01:05:11.934
Come on.

01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:21.672
And you there when Father died?

01:06:24.717 --> 01:06:27.550
Yes.

01:06:31.511 --> 01:06:35.257
- How did it happen?
- What made you think of it now?

01:06:36.054 --> 01:06:38.757
I do not know.

01:06:39.513 --> 01:06:42.596
You know, it was an accident.

01:06:46.807 --> 01:06:49.641
What sort of accident?

01:06:52.447 --> 01:06:56.806
We were on the road, we stopped,
he got out of the car...

01:06:57.478 --> 01:07:01.555
- ...and another car hit him.
- What sort of car?

01:07:05.064 --> 01:07:08.182
Van, Tommy, coming very fast.

01:07:08.732 --> 01:07:12.229
- What sort of van?
- I do not know.

01:07:14.942 --> 01:07:18.356
Why did you stop?

01:07:28.197 --> 01:07:32.062
- Why did you stop?
- I had to pee.

01:08:31.594 --> 01:08:35.126
Now I can do whatever I want with you.

01:08:38.095 --> 01:08:41.261
Go ahead.

01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:51.720
Tommy?

01:08:56.852 --> 01:08:59.685
Tommy?

01:10:58.228 --> 01:11:00.847
Good night, Mom.

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:18.684
Good night, Tommy!

01:11:34.574 --> 01:11:37.775
Everything will be alright my love.

01:12:31.302 --> 01:12:34.170
Good morning!

01:12:36.472 --> 01:12:41.095
Mom...
Good morning!

01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:47.266
Weird. I was in university...

01:12:48.849 --> 01:12:52.181
...I was a rusty tin...

01:12:52.182 --> 01:12:56.851
...or not even a tin,
but some kind of container.

01:13:00.835 --> 01:13:05.010
I moved to creak, as the old job.

01:13:09.106 --> 01:13:14.346
When I lent down, this rusty sort of
liquid flow through my mouth.

01:13:16.692 --> 01:13:19.442
It was cool.

01:13:23.737 --> 01:13:26.938
Good morning!

01:13:30.989 --> 01:13:34.854
Mom, this is Monica.
Monica, mom.

01:13:35.824 --> 01:13:38.906
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:13:42.535 --> 01:13:45.569
What did you dream about?

01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:50.572
Nothing.

01:13:54.872 --> 01:13:58.073
Enjoy.

01:14:10.854 --> 01:14:13.997
Did we wake you when
we came in last night?

01:14:15.671 --> 01:14:18.753
- I wasn't asleep.
- But it was dawn.

01:14:19.547 --> 01:14:22.879
Did you ever sleep, Mom?

01:14:24.549 --> 01:14:27.501
Sometimes.

01:14:33.427 --> 01:14:36.841
Monica went out for couple of things,
she'll be back soon.

01:14:38.262 --> 01:14:42.008
She'll be living here for a while, I mean
of course only if you don't mind.

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:47.052
Mom?

01:14:49.555 --> 01:14:51.886
She is a nice girl.

01:14:53.817 --> 01:14:57.224
Pleased to have her here.

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:15.270
...after thought?
I love thinking about this.

01:15:15.425 --> 01:15:20.275
Imagine great snow storms over the oceans,
in the mountains, deep in the clouds...

01:15:20.276 --> 01:15:22.212
for millions of years on this planet,

01:15:22.213 --> 01:15:24.556
...billions of tiny snow crystals have
been whirling about...

01:15:24.557 --> 01:15:28.763
...and no two of the are same.
Just like us in fact.

01:15:28.998 --> 01:15:32.072
- As people?
- Yeah, as two.

01:15:32.048 --> 01:15:35.253
I was thinking of all living things,
not just our faces and our fingerprints.

01:15:35.254 --> 01:15:39.241
villus in our lungs, our irises,
the structure of our brains...

01:15:39.241 --> 01:15:41.094
...and nails, you know,
everything about us.

01:15:41.246 --> 01:15:45.040
I mean, think about, how long the birds here?
They came not long after dinasours.

01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:48.637
Basicly, way before us. Can you imagine,
how many billions of feathers they produce...

01:15:48.995 --> 01:15:52.326
From ostrich to terns, to hummingbirds, from penguins

01:15:52.746 --> 01:15:55.043
Everywhere in the world.
It must be an orbital thing.

01:15:55.044 --> 01:15:58.115
A billion times of billion times of billion, you know...

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:02.620
There are no two alike.
This is a duck's feather.

01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:07.149
It's almost incomprehensible, billions
of amazingly complex patterns...

01:16:07.150 --> 01:16:10.035
...permanently whirling around us
and never repeat themselves.

01:16:14.027 --> 01:16:15.675
What's the matter?

01:16:15.676 --> 01:16:19.245
I don't know Tommy...
This is so...

01:16:21.514 --> 01:16:23.973
...so immature.

01:16:23.974 --> 01:16:28.068
- Really?
- Yes, really.

01:16:29.426 --> 01:16:31.221
So?

01:16:33.001 --> 01:16:36.981
- So what?
- Do you like kids?

01:17:17.642 --> 01:17:18.934
Come in.

01:17:20.211 --> 01:17:21.589
Hi Mom.

01:17:22.152 --> 01:17:24.855
Smells great, doesn't it?

01:17:25.203 --> 01:17:28.653
Monica baked it, I was the kitchen boy.

01:17:29.089 --> 01:17:32.481
- He is a very good kitchen boy.
- Thank you very much.

01:17:35.824 --> 01:17:38.657
Thanks.

01:17:42.534 --> 01:17:46.399
- I'm not hungry now, I'll have it later.
- Okay.

01:18:51.225 --> 01:18:53.844
Mom.

01:19:02.937 --> 01:19:06.020
Good night!

01:19:14.485 --> 01:19:16.093
I don't think she's been up for the day.

01:19:16.701 --> 01:19:20.642
- I think you should talk to her.
- And what shall I say it?

01:21:15.191 --> 01:21:17.728
Mom?

01:21:18.776 --> 01:21:21.858
It's you.

01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:53.620
Wait.

01:22:03.291 --> 01:22:06.243
- Hang on.
- Why?

01:22:15.295 --> 01:22:18.164
I have to take a shower.

01:22:20.381 --> 01:22:23.664
Let's take one together.

01:22:50.183 --> 01:22:53.384
Tommy, don't.

01:22:54.809 --> 01:22:57.891
No, no!
No.

01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:07.718
Stop it.

01:24:17.772 --> 01:24:21.792
- Wait.
- What? What's wrong?

01:24:23.048 --> 01:24:26.130
I think she woke up.

01:25:34.823 --> 01:25:37.905
Aren't you going to say anything?

01:26:18.588 --> 01:26:21.421
Hello.

01:26:29.008 --> 01:26:32.209
Can I help you?

01:26:53.058 --> 01:26:56.472
Go inside now Tommy.

01:27:03.604 --> 01:27:06.805
Who are you?

01:27:49.036 --> 01:27:51.442
Who is that, Mom?

01:28:04.333 --> 01:28:06.953
Mom.

01:29:12.273 --> 01:29:15.438
Who was that woman, Mom?

01:29:28.904 --> 01:29:31.986
Tommy?

01:29:36.531 --> 01:29:39.234
Tommy?

01:31:29.112 --> 01:31:32.313
I know her.

01:32:09.793 --> 01:32:12.745
Tommy?

01:32:21.054 --> 01:32:24.791
Let me in, please.

01:32:25.882 --> 01:32:29.295
You've been in there for hours.

01:32:31.259 --> 01:32:34.756
Please, open the door.

01:32:42.304 --> 01:32:45.256
I'm leaving.

01:33:51.828 --> 01:33:54.199
Mom?

01:34:01.373 --> 01:34:04.206
Mom?

01:34:34.510 --> 01:34:37.674
I have to tell you something.

01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:48.129
I was nine,
I was on the beach...

01:34:50.473 --> 01:34:53.556
It was so cold.

01:34:55.892 --> 01:34:58.926
- Then I met this boy?
- What, what, what boy?

01:34:59.262 --> 01:35:03.348
What beach? Who cares?
Who is this woman, Mother?

01:38:35.343 --> 01:38:38.757
No! No!
No!

01:39:09.271 --> 01:39:11.891
I'm scared.

01:39:15.859 --> 01:39:20.521
I do not know who you are.

01:39:23.641 --> 01:39:27.684
Or who I am either.

01:39:33.780 --> 01:39:37.111
Who are you, Mom?

01:39:39.698 --> 01:39:42.532
Who are you?

01:39:46.993 --> 01:39:50.075
Why did you do it?

01:39:51.619 --> 01:39:54.951
Why did you do this thing?

01:39:57.163 --> 01:40:02.305
- Look at yourself, Tommy, you're here.
- So? So? So?

01:40:02.563 --> 01:40:06.996
What am I supposed to do now?
What am I supposed to do with this fucking life of mine?

01:40:06.998 --> 01:40:09.676
Don't you see I have no idea who I am!

01:40:09.914 --> 01:40:13.039
Can't you understand?

01:40:14.627 --> 01:40:18.954
- What more could you want?
- More than what?

01:40:21.296 --> 01:40:25.042
You're here, Tommy.

01:40:26.506 --> 01:40:29.589
You're alive

01:40:30.341 --> 01:40:33.423
Take your hands off me.

01:40:34.509 --> 01:40:38.635
Take your hands off me.

01:40:51.348 --> 01:40:54.300
Who are you?

01:41:02.227 --> 01:41:05.345
Who are you?

01:41:07.437 --> 01:41:10.187
Who are you?

01:41:11.897 --> 01:41:14.849
Who are you?

01:44:50.490 --> 01:44:52.364
Thank you...

01:44:54.398 --> 01:44:57.082
...Rebecca.
