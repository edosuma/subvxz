WEBVTT

00:07.967 --> 00:12.233
- Are you guys ready to make
the best epic fail video ever?

00:12.333 --> 00:13.700
- We were born ready.

00:13.800 --> 00:16.033
- Pig Billy, Boy Billy.
Pig Billy, Boy Billy.

00:16.133 --> 00:18.467
Pig Billy, Boy Billy.
- Nora...

00:18.567 --> 00:21.133
You are the adorable
little t-ball player

00:21.233 --> 00:24.100
and, Billy, you are
the unlucky kid

00:24.200 --> 00:26.700
who "accidentally"
gets in her way.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.467
Hold and...

00:31.567 --> 00:32.533
Action!

00:32.633 --> 00:34.800
- [stiffly] Time to hit
one over the fence.

00:36.433 --> 00:38.233
- [stiffly] Swing away,
but be careful

00:38.333 --> 00:40.867
not to hit me in
my "special area."

00:42.400 --> 00:45.567
- Oh, cut! Cut! Cut!
Cut! Cut!

00:45.667 --> 00:51.267
Guys, epic fails are
supposed to look natural.

00:51.367 --> 00:52.433
- You want an epic fail--

00:52.533 --> 00:54.600
just point the camera
at your face.

00:54.700 --> 00:58.967
- Ah, look who's back from
rehearsals of the "Buttcracker."

01:00.833 --> 01:01.767
- The "Buttcracker"?

01:01.867 --> 01:05.667
I see that ballet
every time dad bends over.

01:07.433 --> 01:08.733
- It's called "Swan Lake"

01:08.833 --> 01:10.600
and I worked really
hard to get the lead.

01:10.700 --> 01:12.467
And in just a few short days,

01:12.567 --> 01:16.367
I'll make my dance debut
and become "The Swan."

01:17.833 --> 01:20.967
- So, it's going to be
three hours of that?

01:21.067 --> 01:23.400
- I know.
Aren't you excited?

01:23.500 --> 01:25.400
- Clear out, birdbrain.

01:25.500 --> 01:27.367
I've gotta get back
to my epic fail video

01:27.467 --> 01:29.367
so I can win that
Chirper contest.

01:29.467 --> 01:31.367
- The first video to get
to one million re-chirps

01:31.467 --> 01:33.100
wins $10,000.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.600
- Let me guess--you have
some ridiculous

01:34.700 --> 01:36.500
over-the-top plan
for the winnings.

01:36.600 --> 01:39.267
- No. I'm gonna buy a tiny
island in the South Pacific

01:39.367 --> 01:44.133
where I'll start a dictatorship
called Maxlandia!

01:44.233 --> 01:45.600
- Wait, what'll we get?

01:45.700 --> 01:48.133
- You guys get to be one
of the lucky few

01:48.233 --> 01:52.800
to be on the internet.

01:52.900 --> 01:54.567
- I just wanna hit
something with a bat.

01:54.667 --> 01:58.300
- MAX: Oh!
- BILLY: Oh, ho, ho!

02:01.367 --> 02:03.167
- The camera wasn't rolling.

02:03.267 --> 02:05.433
- I know.

02:06.100 --> 02:08.167
- *

02:08.267 --> 02:09.433
* What you see

02:09.533 --> 02:11.133
* Is not what you get

02:11.233 --> 02:14.233
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

02:14.333 --> 02:15.967
* We fit right in

02:16.067 --> 02:17.433
* Bet you never guessed

02:17.533 --> 02:18.967
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

02:19.067 --> 02:20.533
* Just like all the rest

02:20.633 --> 02:22.333
* A picture
perfect family *

02:22.433 --> 02:24.433
* Is what we try to be

02:24.533 --> 02:25.600
* Look closer,
you might see *

02:25.700 --> 02:27.433
* The crazy things we do

02:27.533 --> 02:29.100
* This isn't
make believe *

02:29.200 --> 02:30.667
* It's our reality

02:30.767 --> 02:32.300
* Just your average family

02:32.400 --> 02:35.367
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

02:35.467 --> 02:39.067
* Livin' a double life

02:45.067 --> 02:48.233
How dare they call
my staged videos fake!

02:48.333 --> 02:51.733
You guys need to fail better.

02:51.833 --> 02:55.133
- Fail better as we skateboard
down the stairs backwards.

02:55.233 --> 02:57.500
Got it.

02:57.600 --> 03:00.267
- Yeah, I'm not doing that.

03:00.367 --> 03:02.233
- ["Swan Lake" music]

03:02.333 --> 03:04.600
- Hiddenville High presents
"Swan Lake" this Saturday.

03:04.700 --> 03:06.400
Get your tickets now
to see me become...

03:06.500 --> 03:10.800
"The Swan."

03:10.900 --> 03:13.700
- Get outta the living
room, flappy feet.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.533
- [turns off music]
- No way.

03:15.633 --> 03:17.133
I'm making this video
to post on Chirper

03:17.233 --> 03:19.367
so we can boost ticket
sales for the ballet.

03:19.467 --> 03:20.867
We've only sold five so far.

03:20.967 --> 03:25.067
- Ooh, I bought
my five tickets, sweetie!

03:25.133 --> 03:27.233
[squealing]
I am so proud of you.

03:27.333 --> 03:28.567
- Thanks, Mom.

03:28.667 --> 03:31.467
Beat it, loser!

03:31.567 --> 03:34.300
- Okay, guys, we are
still making our video.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.700
Just ignore Phoebe
and remember...

03:36.800 --> 03:39.067
this epic fail has
to look real.

03:39.167 --> 03:43.100
- Got it!
Let's rock this!

03:43.200 --> 03:45.733
- Oh!

03:47.933 --> 03:50.067
- BILLY & NORA: [laughing]

03:50.133 --> 03:51.867
- Did you see that?

03:51.967 --> 03:54.133
That's the kind of video
you should be making.

03:54.233 --> 03:56.100
- Great idea, Nora.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.700
You're fired.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.667
Phoebe, are you okay?

03:59.767 --> 04:01.767
Uh, let me, uh, use your phone
to call the paramedics.

04:01.867 --> 04:04.067
- [powers zapping]
Nice try, Max.

04:04.167 --> 04:06.233
You are not posting
this video of me falling.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.733
I've worked "tutu" hard.

04:07.833 --> 04:10.833
[laughing]
Tutu.

04:10.933 --> 04:13.633
Ballet humor.
You wouldn't get it.

04:13.733 --> 04:17.533
Now I'll just go post
the good parts to Chirper

04:17.633 --> 04:20.700
and then ballet
it down for an app.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.600
Okay, I'm done with
ballet humor now.

04:25.367 --> 04:28.100
- I'll get that phone.

04:28.200 --> 04:31.500
For Maxlandia!

04:31.600 --> 04:33.733
- Hank, I'm going
to run errands.

04:33.833 --> 04:35.333
Let the gardener in.

04:35.433 --> 04:37.267
- That's great, sweetheart.

04:37.367 --> 04:40.433
Wait, gardeners
cost money.

04:40.533 --> 04:42.433
- I found poison ivy
in the back yard.

04:42.533 --> 04:43.933
He's removing it.

04:44.067 --> 04:45.900
So, you kids stay out
of the backyard.

04:46.067 --> 04:47.867
There's poison ivy
over there.

04:47.967 --> 04:49.567
- BOTH: That's great, Mom.

04:49.667 --> 04:51.600
- Okay, you know what
would be great?

04:51.700 --> 04:53.600
If you kids went inside
until I got back.

04:53.700 --> 04:55.567
- Well, don't be silly.
I'm right here.

04:55.667 --> 04:57.067
I can watch 'em.

04:57.167 --> 04:59.067
- I know, but if
they get poison ivy,

04:59.100 --> 05:01.300
they'll be miserable
and they'll miss the ballet.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.767
- Oh, I get it.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.767
If your kids are in a bus
hanging off a bridge,

05:04.867 --> 05:06.267
call Thunderman.

05:06.367 --> 05:08.200
Ooh, but there's a scary
bush in the back yard.

05:08.300 --> 05:11.067
Everybody in the house.

05:11.100 --> 05:14.333
- I'm sorry, honey.
I totally trust you.

05:14.433 --> 05:17.500
See you guys later.

05:17.600 --> 05:21.700
- Okay, Nora, watch
me sink this shot.

05:24.167 --> 05:28.567
- This is why we get
picked last in gym.

05:28.667 --> 05:30.200
- I'll get it.

05:30.300 --> 05:33.133
- Wait, I think that's where mom
just said the poison ivy was.

05:33.233 --> 05:35.567
- Mom was out here?

05:35.667 --> 05:38.867
- Somebody was yelling at us.

05:38.967 --> 05:41.067
Maybe we should ask dad
if we can get it?

05:41.133 --> 05:43.067
- Hey, Dad, can we
get our disc back?

05:43.167 --> 05:44.500
- Is it on the roof?
- BILLY & NORA: No.

05:44.600 --> 05:47.100
- Then go ahead.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.567
- [zooming]

05:48.667 --> 05:50.933
Got it--and no poison ivy.

05:51.067 --> 05:53.100
Up top!
- [palms smack]

05:59.433 --> 06:01.867
- MAX: [powers zapping]

06:04.267 --> 06:06.333
[powers zapping]

06:08.167 --> 06:09.900
- [sighing]

06:10.067 --> 06:13.200
Teen girl cell phone
death grip.

06:31.833 --> 06:36.133
Time for The Epic Faillerina
to buy me my island.

06:36.233 --> 06:40.100
Uploading Phoebe's
fall to my Chirper page.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.667
- [data zooming]

06:41.767 --> 06:44.367
- Rubbing Phoebe's phone
in my armpit.

06:53.733 --> 06:57.467
And now I make
my clean getaway.

06:57.567 --> 06:59.433
- [food splatting]

07:04.367 --> 07:06.233
- Cleanish.

07:10.767 --> 07:17.767
- *

07:17.867 --> 07:20.133
- Ow.

07:20.233 --> 07:24.267
- Hey, genius, somebody
gave me poison ivy.

07:24.367 --> 07:27.433
- Ew, who did that?

07:27.533 --> 07:28.867
- Look in a mirror.

07:28.967 --> 07:34.167
- [gasping]
Is he behind me?

07:34.267 --> 07:36.067
- No. It's you.

07:36.167 --> 07:37.633
Don't you have a rash, too?

07:37.733 --> 07:40.533
- Only this tiny red
dot on my arm.

07:40.633 --> 07:43.800
Ahhhhhhh! It's growing!

07:43.900 --> 07:45.833
- It only grows
when you scratch it.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.200
- Then we should
stop scratching.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.400
- But it feels so good.
- I know.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.200
- What is happening in here?

07:52.300 --> 07:53.800
Oh, no.

07:53.900 --> 07:55.167
You got poison ivy?

07:55.267 --> 07:57.300
Please don't tell me
this happened on my watch.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.567
- It didn't.
- Whew.

07:58.667 --> 08:02.167
- It happened while you were
ignoring us on your watch.

08:02.267 --> 08:03.400
- You cannot tell your mom.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.200
She'll never let me
hear the end of it.

08:05.300 --> 08:08.667
Don't worry--I'll find a cure.

08:08.767 --> 08:10.400
Aw, what's this for?

08:10.500 --> 08:12.067
- Just giving you poison
ivy to make sure

08:12.133 --> 08:14.933
you want this cure
as much as we do.

08:15.067 --> 08:16.733
- Ha. Nice try, Nora.

08:16.833 --> 08:18.367
I flew into the sun once.

08:18.467 --> 08:21.433
Do you really think Thunderman
can get poison ivy?

08:21.533 --> 08:22.900
Ahhhhhhh!

08:23.067 --> 08:28.067
It's like a thousand
fire ants are eating my skin!

08:34.067 --> 08:37.467
- Phoebe, I saw your
video on Chirper.

08:37.567 --> 08:39.300
Quite a performance.

08:39.400 --> 08:40.900
- Oh, thanks.

08:41.067 --> 08:43.067
Looks like my post
was a hit.

08:43.133 --> 08:46.800
- Yeah, a real smash.

08:46.900 --> 08:48.833
Hopefully, a million
people will see it.

08:48.933 --> 08:50.667
- I hope you got your ticket

08:50.767 --> 08:52.500
to the show tomorrow
night, Gideon.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.500
- Sure did. Can't wait to
see you "break a leg."

08:55.600 --> 08:58.100
- Thanks. But "break a leg"
is for theater folks.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.267
Saying it to a dancer
is kinda creepy.

09:00.367 --> 09:03.167
Especially when
you make that face.

09:09.533 --> 09:12.067
- Your first fan.

09:12.100 --> 09:13.700
Looks like you became
a star even before

09:13.800 --> 09:15.500
you made your big debut.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.933
You're welcome.

09:18.067 --> 09:21.133
- I am not a star, Max.
I'm just Phoebe.

09:21.233 --> 09:23.133
The same humble sister
you've always known.

09:23.233 --> 09:26.367
Now if you'll excuse me,
my fans are waiting.

09:30.100 --> 09:33.400
- That's it--fall for Gideon.

09:35.133 --> 09:37.700
- CROWD: Aww...

09:37.800 --> 09:41.300
- Don't worry, you'll get
the full show on Saturday.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.633
[sighing]
Good afternoon, Madame Gigi.

09:47.733 --> 09:49.100
- Bonjour, Phoebe.

09:49.200 --> 09:52.200
Okay, too much touching.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.267
- Sorry, I'm just excited.

09:54.367 --> 09:56.067
It's our last rehearsal
before the big show.

09:56.100 --> 09:58.267
- Yes, the show,
it is sold out.

09:58.367 --> 10:03.233
The girls say it's because
of your...video.

10:03.333 --> 10:04.633
- Sold out?

10:04.733 --> 10:05.833
That's so awesome.

10:05.933 --> 10:07.900
It'll be standing room only,
when I become...

10:08.000 --> 10:09.633
"The Swan."

10:09.733 --> 10:10.900
- No, no, no.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.800
Phoebe, Mathilda will
become "The Swan."

10:14.900 --> 10:18.333
You will stay home.

10:18.433 --> 10:20.333
- I'm sorry, can you
repeat that?

10:20.433 --> 10:24.833
Your accent made it sound
like I'm staying home.

10:24.933 --> 10:26.633
- Oui. You will ruin my show.

10:26.733 --> 10:29.033
You are the one who falls
and breaks things, non?

10:29.133 --> 10:31.433
[clapping hands]

10:31.533 --> 10:34.433
"The Epic Faillerina"?

10:34.533 --> 10:36.867
- Epic Faillerina?

10:36.967 --> 10:39.400
Oh!

10:40.333 --> 10:42.000
Yeah, that's me,
but I didn't fall.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.633
Well, I did fall, but...

10:43.733 --> 10:45.467
How did I even--

10:45.567 --> 10:47.967
Max!

10:56.200 --> 10:58.333
- Oh, there's
the swan princess.

10:58.433 --> 10:59.867
- [slams locker]

11:00.067 --> 11:03.600
- Well, aren't you
the angry bird.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.933
- The Epic Faillerina?

11:06.067 --> 11:08.367
You turned me into
The Epic Faillerina!

11:08.467 --> 11:10.933
- I turned you into
a Chirper sensation

11:11.067 --> 11:13.267
and helped you sell out
your stupid ballet show.

11:13.367 --> 11:15.333
- Oh! You mean the ballet show
I was kicked out of

11:15.433 --> 11:17.500
because you turned me
into The Epic Faillerina!

11:20.100 --> 11:22.200
- It's cool. She knows me.

11:22.300 --> 11:25.233
We're practically dating.
[laughing]

11:25.333 --> 11:26.833
Phoebe, can you take
a picture with my--

11:26.933 --> 11:28.433
- [growling]

11:28.533 --> 11:31.900
- My boo says now
is not a good time.

11:32.067 --> 11:37.567
- So that's exciting.
You and Gideon, hm?

11:37.667 --> 11:40.300
- Max, this is my first
lead in a ballet.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.967
I have destroyed my toes
for this moment.

11:43.067 --> 11:46.833
- To be fair, you've always
had unsightly toes.

11:46.933 --> 11:48.267
- Well, you're not
gonna have any toes,

11:48.367 --> 11:50.067
if you don't take down
that video.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.967
- No, way. I am this close
to winning that contest

11:52.067 --> 11:53.933
and buying my island.

11:54.067 --> 11:55.500
Tell you what.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.067
You can prance around
in your chicken suit

11:58.133 --> 12:00.633
at the grand opening
of Maxlandia.

12:00.733 --> 12:01.967
- This isn't over, Max.

12:02.067 --> 12:04.067
One way or another,
I'm gonna get you back--

12:04.100 --> 12:05.767
right after I get
my lead back.

12:05.867 --> 12:08.900
And I'm gonna show all of you
that I am not The Epic Failler--

12:09.067 --> 12:11.200
Whoa!
- CROWD: [gasping]

12:11.300 --> 12:14.467
- [cell phone cameras clicking]

12:14.567 --> 12:16.233
- Starting now.

12:18.133 --> 12:20.233
Okay now.

12:22.333 --> 12:24.533
- Dad, did you find the cure?

12:24.633 --> 12:27.667
- Not yet, but I promise
I will click on every link,

12:27.767 --> 12:31.400
I will search every page,
and I will not rest until--

12:31.500 --> 12:36.667
Ooh, hoo, hoo, pictures
of celebrities without makeup.

12:36.767 --> 12:38.867
- Dad, focus!

12:38.967 --> 12:40.900
Our poison ivy's
getting worse.

12:41.067 --> 12:42.733
- I hope, for your sake,

12:42.833 --> 12:44.733
that mom doesn't
come home soon.

12:44.833 --> 12:46.067
- COMPUTER VOICE:
Alert! Alert!

12:46.167 --> 12:48.067
Mom is approaching.

12:48.167 --> 12:50.067
- Oh, no.
Hide your arms.

12:50.167 --> 12:53.733
Do not let her see
you scratching.

12:53.833 --> 12:56.100
- Oh, I found
the cutest outfit

12:56.200 --> 12:57.867
to wear to the ballet tonight.

12:57.967 --> 12:59.467
- Oh, that's great, honey.

12:59.567 --> 13:05.367
- I'm just gonna go upstairs
and find some shoes to match.

13:05.467 --> 13:08.467
Oh, we're gonna have
so much fun tonight.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.267
- Dad, I can't
live like this.

13:14.367 --> 13:16.233
You have to find that cure.

13:16.333 --> 13:17.433
- Oh, here's something.

13:17.533 --> 13:19.167
There's a rare plant
in the Amazon

13:19.267 --> 13:21.867
that the locals say
cures poison ivy.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.800
Check it out.
- Think it'll work?

13:23.900 --> 13:25.167
- Only one way to find out.

13:25.267 --> 13:28.100
Race ya there, Billy.
- BILLY: [zooming]

13:28.200 --> 13:31.900
- Thunderman, awa--
- BILLY: [zooming] Got it!

13:32.067 --> 13:34.467
- I've gotta get
a shorter catchphrase.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.400
- ALL: [sighing]

13:41.167 --> 13:42.600
- Dr. Colosso, my Epic
Faillerina video

13:42.700 --> 13:45.067
should be closing in on
a million re-chirps.

13:45.133 --> 13:46.667
Ready to celebrate
with some cake?

13:46.767 --> 13:49.567
- I can't believe we're
gonna get our own country.

13:49.667 --> 13:54.433
- We? It's Maxlandia,
not Max-and-his-bunny-landia.

13:54.533 --> 13:57.167
- Tell that to the flag.
[clicking button]

13:57.267 --> 13:59.467
Ta-da!
- [fanfare music]

14:02.800 --> 14:04.967
- We're not using that.

14:05.067 --> 14:06.200
- Awww...

14:06.300 --> 14:08.467
- All right, here we go.

14:08.567 --> 14:12.067
What's going on?
Where's my video?

14:12.133 --> 14:14.067
- Deleted.
- Ahhhhhh!

14:14.133 --> 14:17.500
- [heavy thud]

14:17.600 --> 14:20.133
- A few hours ago,
I came down here

14:20.233 --> 14:22.500
to rub a bunch of your stuff
under my armpit.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.067
Instead, I found your computer
was open... [laughing]

14:28.100 --> 14:29.933
...and you were
still logged in.

14:30.067 --> 14:33.700
- What? That's impossible.
I never forget to log out.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.767
Unless someone else
forgot to log out.

14:36.867 --> 14:39.667
- Ooh. Sorry, I had
some important work

14:39.767 --> 14:41.200
to do this morning.

14:41.300 --> 14:42.967
- [music playing]
- Yeah!

14:43.067 --> 14:44.467
- WOMAN ON VIDEO:
Good job, flex ladies.

14:44.567 --> 14:47.333
Ooh, you gotta burn it
to earn it!

14:47.433 --> 14:49.067
Come on!
- Oh, yeah!

14:49.100 --> 14:51.100
- Let's go, gals!
- Yea-a-a-a-h!

14:51.200 --> 14:54.367
I can crush a carrot
with these bunny buns.

14:54.467 --> 14:56.700
Wanna see me earn it?
- MAX: No!

14:56.800 --> 14:58.500
- Hmph.

14:58.600 --> 15:01.100
- Phoebe, I can't
believe you did this.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.967
- Well, it wasn't all me.

15:03.067 --> 15:05.567
You were kind enough to send
that email to Madame Gigi

15:05.667 --> 15:08.233
confessing you faked the video.

15:08.333 --> 15:09.933
- I didn't send any--

15:10.067 --> 15:11.967
[gasping]
You hacked my email?!

15:12.067 --> 15:13.967
- [feigned gasping]

15:14.067 --> 15:18.933
- You will not be prancing at
the grand opening of Maxlandia.

15:19.067 --> 15:21.333
- Oh, I'll be prancing tonight.

15:21.433 --> 15:23.767
That's right--Madame Gigi
gave me the lead back.

15:23.867 --> 15:26.700
I'm gettin' ma swan on!

15:58.733 --> 16:03.433
- Phoebe looks so graceful
and elegant, don't you think?

16:03.533 --> 16:05.533
- I'm going to the toilet.

16:08.833 --> 16:10.667
Hey, Gideon,
take my phone and record

16:10.767 --> 16:12.667
everything that
happens onstage, okay?

16:12.767 --> 16:16.133
I've got 10 grand to win--
and I'm not sharing.

16:16.233 --> 16:17.967
- That's cool.

16:18.067 --> 16:20.767
As long as I can get your
sister's phone number off this.

16:20.867 --> 16:23.467
- Just promise to call
her every day.

16:24.433 --> 16:29.633
- ["Swan Lake" music continues]

16:29.733 --> 16:33.700

17:41.100 --> 17:44.067
Now, your Black Swan costume
is hanging over there.

17:44.100 --> 17:47.300
You change while I go sell
over-priced refreshments.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.267
- Thank you, Madame Gigi.

17:49.367 --> 17:51.400

Too much touching.

[clapping hands]

17:54.067 --> 17:57.067
- Whoa!

17:57.133 --> 17:58.333
Get out of here, Max.

17:58.433 --> 18:00.200
And stop trying
to make me fail.

18:00.300 --> 18:01.600
It's not gonna work.

18:01.700 --> 18:04.233
- I know. You're
too good out there.

18:04.333 --> 18:05.600
Which is why
I'm shoving you in here.

18:05.700 --> 18:07.233

Max, what are you doing?

- Hey!
- Ow!

18:37.333 --> 18:42.167
- That isn't Phoebe.
I think it's Max.

18:42.267 --> 18:44.600
- Give it up, girlfriend.

18:47.467 --> 18:51.267

What's wrong?
- What is that on your neck?

18:56.067 --> 19:00.233
- Oh! It's a leech.

19:00.333 --> 19:03.633
It must be from
the Amazon plant.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.067
- The kids got poison
ivy on my watch

19:22.167 --> 19:24.633
and I hid it because I didn't
want to admit I was wrong.

19:24.733 --> 19:26.933
I'm sorry. I love you.
I've gotta go hose us off.

19:27.067 --> 19:29.767

- No! I can't believe
Gideon gave you

21:31.767 --> 21:33.767
my "Black Swan Fail" video.

21:33.867 --> 21:37.233
- Well, he does think
we're dating.

21:37.333 --> 21:39.467
- Weird.

21:39.567 --> 21:42.500
So, what are you gonna
do with the $10,000?

21:42.600 --> 21:43.900
- Well, I used most
of it to pay for

21:44.067 --> 21:47.100
dad, Billy and Nora's
leech removal.

21:47.200 --> 21:49.867
And then I bought you
some land with the rest.

You bought me land?

21:52.667 --> 21:54.767
