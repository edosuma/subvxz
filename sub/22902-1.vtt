in something

01:21:03.757 --> 01:21:06.457
even when there's
no reason to believe.

01:21:06.459 --> 01:21:08.794
It comes from up there

01:21:08.796 --> 01:21:11.665
and from right here.

01:21:14.301 --> 01:21:16.401
Speaking of believing,
what in the world

01:21:16.403 --> 01:21:18.370
made you think you could
beat Alonzo Medina?

01:21:18.372 --> 01:21:20.371
Oh, shut up.

01:21:20.373 --> 01:21:23.541
You know I could have taken
that kid in three rounds max.

01:21:23.543 --> 01:21:24.776
They must have
all kinds of drugs

01:21:24.778 --> 01:21:26.510
pumped into your system, man.

01:21:26.512 --> 01:21:27.979
I mean, you don't even
know what you're saying.

01:21:27.981 --> 01:21:30.014
It is not the drugs, okay?

01:21:30.016 --> 01:21:32.384
It's a fact, I would
have taken that kid.

01:21:32.386 --> 01:21:33.919
He's young,
he's inexperienced,

01:21:33.921 --> 01:21:35.653
and I'm the seasoned
professional.

01:21:35.655 --> 01:21:37.656
I read an article
that said you were 41.

01:21:37.658 --> 01:21:39.724
I am 41.

01:21:39.726 --> 01:21:41.292
You're 46 if you're a day.

01:21:41.294 --> 01:21:42.827
That's close to 41.

01:21:42.829 --> 01:21:45.899
Oh, Lord, you're
probably closer to 50.

01:21:47.601 --> 01:21:50.501
Nah.
