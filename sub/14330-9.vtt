20:08.874 --> 20:11.476
AND MAKE THIS THE GREATEST NIGHT
OF YOUR LIFE.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.078
[gulps]

20:15.113 --> 20:17.149
- AH!

20:17.215 --> 20:19.751
I CAN'T LET MY PARENTS MARRY
MR. CROCKER AND A ROSEBUSH.

20:19.818 --> 20:21.053
AS MUCH AS I WANT
TO KISS YOU,

20:21.119 --> 20:24.690
I'VE GOT TO SAVE MY FAMILY.

20:24.756 --> 20:26.992
- DO YOU, DENZEL, TAKE
TIMMY'S MOM TO BE YOUR WIFE?

20:27.059 --> 20:28.927
HURRY UP AND SAY, "I DO"
BEFORE SHE COMES TO HER SENSES.

20:28.994 --> 20:30.228
- I DO.

20:30.295 --> 20:31.964
- AND DO YOU, TIMMY'S DAD,

20:32.030 --> 20:33.098
TAKE THIS DEAD ROSEBUSH
TO BE YOUR WIFE?

20:33.165 --> 20:34.800
- [sobbing]

20:34.866 --> 20:36.835
I DO!

20:36.902 --> 20:38.937
- DO YOU, TIMMY'S MOM,
TAKE DENZEL TO BE YOUR HUSBAND?

20:39.004 --> 20:41.406
- WAIT!

20:46.178 --> 20:48.046
HA HA!
PSYCH.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.252
COSMO!

20:54.319 --> 20:55.854
- YOU HOLD IT RIGHT THERE,
SWEETNESS.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.055
THE KID WANTS ME.

20:57.122 --> 20:58.890
- THIS IS OUT OF CONTROL.

20:58.957 --> 21:00.592
I WISH CUPID WERE HERE
RIGHT NOW!

21:02.160 --> 21:03.428
[trilling]

21:03.495 --> 21:05.530
HEY, WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA?

21:05.597 --> 21:09.134
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO WIN THE BIG
CRUISE SHIP LIMBO CONTEST.

21:09.201 --> 21:11.570
- I'M SORRY, CUPID,
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO HELP ME.

21:11.637 --> 21:13.405
I TOOK YOUR LOVE ARROWS,

21:13.472 --> 21:15.107
AND NOW MY DAD'S GOING
TO MARRY A ROSEBUSH,

21:15.173 --> 21:17.409
AND MOM'S GOING TO MARRY
MY CRAZY TEACHER.

21:17.476 --> 21:19.144
- WHAT?

21:19.211 --> 21:21.113
HOW DARE YOU TOUCH MY STUFF,
MISTER?

21:21.179 --> 21:23.682
GIVE IT BACK.

21:25.851 --> 21:27.619
YOU CAN KEEP THAT.

21:27.686 --> 21:29.454
ALL RIGHT, I'LL CLEAN UP
YOUR LITTLE MESS.

21:29.521 --> 21:31.356
BUT IT WILL COST YOU.

21:31.423 --> 21:34.026
STAND BACK WHILE I FIRE
MY ANTI-LOVE ARROWS.

21:39.665 --> 21:40.866
- IT'S OVER.

21:40.932 --> 21:42.367
IT'S NOT YOU; IT'S ME.

21:42.434 --> 21:43.201
BUT IT'S MOSTLY YOU.

21:47.005 --> 21:48.140
- WE'RE THROUGH.

21:48.206 --> 21:49.708
IT'S NOT YOU; IT'S ME.

21:49.775 --> 21:50.976
BUT IT'S MOSTLY YOU.

21:51.043 --> 21:52.778
- SWEET MOTHER OF J.LO!

21:52.844 --> 21:54.646
WANDA, YOU WIN.

21:54.713 --> 21:56.748
I SURRENDER MYSELF
TO YOUR NUTSY CUCKOO LOVE.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.450
IN THE NAME OF GLORIA ESTEFAN

21:58.517 --> 21:59.885
AND HER ENTIRE
MIAMI SOUND MACHINE,

21:59.951 --> 22:02.154
DO WITH ME WHAT YOU WILL!

22:06.191 --> 22:07.292
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

22:07.359 --> 22:08.927
I'M A MARRIED WOMAN!

22:10.328 --> 22:13.031
- NOW, THAT'S MY WANDA.

22:13.098 --> 22:15.033
- WHERE WAS I?
OH, YES.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.536
DO YOU, TIMMY'S MOM,
TAKE DENZEL TO BE YOUR HUSBAND?

22:17.602 --> 22:18.937
- SHE DOES!
SHE DOES!

22:19.004 --> 22:20.539
- CUPID, FIRE!

22:20.605 --> 22:22.741
- PUCKER UP, TIMMY'S MOM.

22:29.681 --> 22:31.216
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

22:31.283 --> 22:32.918
I'M A MARRIED WOMAN.

22:37.556 --> 22:40.058
- YOU CAUSED A LOT OF TROUBLE,
YOUNG MAN.

22:40.125 --> 22:41.793
AND AS YOUR PUNISHMENT,

22:41.860 --> 22:45.230
YOU'RE GONNA WASH
ALL MY VACATION DIAPERS.

22:45.297 --> 22:48.066
I HOPE YOU LEARNED YOUR LESSON.

22:48.133 --> 22:49.334
[trills]

22:54.306 --> 22:56.508
- MAN, I'M GLAD
THAT'S OVER WITH.

22:56.575 --> 22:59.244
MY PARENTS ARE STILL TOGETHER,
AND EVERYTHING'S BACK TO NORMAL.

22:59.311 --> 23:01.913
- HEY, TIMMY.

23:01.980 --> 23:04.082
I'M TAKING YOUR MOTHER OUT
TO DINNER.

23:04.149 --> 23:07.285
WAIT'LL YOU SEE
THE NEW OUTFIT I BOUGHT HER.

23:07.352 --> 23:09.955
- I THINK THERE'S A SQUIRREL
IN HERE.

23:10.021 --> 23:11.156
- YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.
