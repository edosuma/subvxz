(APPLAUDING)

00:22.633 --> 00:25.767
PENN: From the Penn and Teller
Theater in Las Vegas, Nevada,

00:25.833 --> 00:29.200
here's our host, Jonathan Ross.

00:29.267 --> 00:31.700
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING)

00:36.067 --> 00:37.433
Thank you so much.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.067
You're very kind.

00:40.100 --> 00:43.233
Welcome to a new season
of <i>Penn and Teller: Fool Us,</i>

00:43.300 --> 00:45.367
a show where,
when someone is flipping the bird,

00:45.433 --> 00:46.600
it usually just means a dove.

00:46.700 --> 00:47.700
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:47.767 --> 00:48.800
Now, this season, I've been asked

00:48.867 --> 00:52.533
to adjust my language,
to be a little less British, and I get it.

00:52.600 --> 00:55.267
Where I say "Lift,"
I know you all say, "Elevator."

00:55.333 --> 00:56.700
Here, you say, "Trash can,"

00:56.767 --> 00:58.167
while I would say, "Rubbish bin."

00:58.233 --> 00:59.733
You say, "Dentist," and, well,

00:59.800 --> 01:01.900
we don't really have a word
for that in London.

01:01.967 --> 01:03.667
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

01:04.033 --> 01:06.000
Now, the whole idea tonight is
for our acts to do a trick

01:06.067 --> 01:08.567
so flawless that Penn and Teller
can't figure it out.

01:08.633 --> 01:12.667
Any magician who can fool them
earns the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

01:12.733 --> 01:16.467
to perform here in Vegas alongside
the dynamic duo of magic.

01:16.533 --> 01:17.533
And here they are,

01:17.600 --> 01:19.733
accompanied by some of Bally's
beautiful Jubilee showgirls,

01:19.867 --> 01:21.333
it's Penn and Teller.

01:21.633 --> 01:23.367
(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

01:35.633 --> 01:38.300
Girlfriend is fierce tonight.

01:38.367 --> 01:39.600
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

01:39.667 --> 01:41.833
That's what I call a show business start.
Let's get going.

01:41.933 --> 01:43.133
Gentlemen, take your seats.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.533
Run down to those chairs,
so the show can begin.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.667
Thank you, ladies.

01:48.733 --> 01:52.167
Now, it's that time I present
to you our first potential fooler.

01:56.167 --> 01:58.667
Hey, I'm Brian Brushwood
from Austin, Texas,

01:59.233 --> 02:01.467
<i>and I tour with a punk rock magic show.</i>

02:02.200 --> 02:03.967
A third of my show is 100% real.

02:04.033 --> 02:06.867
<i>I really do eat fire,</i>
<i>I really do hammer a nail in my nose,</i>

02:06.933 --> 02:10.667
but at some point,
the show secretly transitions.

02:10.733 --> 02:12.067
It's not until halfway through

02:12.133 --> 02:14.233
<i>cutting off my tongue that people realize,</i>

02:14.300 --> 02:16.600
"Wait a minute, it's a magic show."

02:17.200 --> 02:18.733
<i>I remember being in second grade</i>

02:18.933 --> 02:21.033
when I saw Penn and Teller's
first magic show.

02:21.300 --> 02:25.033
<i>I had never seen magic be cool before,</i>
<i>and it blew me away.</i>

02:25.400 --> 02:27.567
<i>I can honestly say that if there</i>
<i>was no Penn and Teller,</i>

02:27.900 --> 02:29.467
<i>there would be no Brian Brushwood.</i>

02:29.600 --> 02:31.900
<i>This is my chance to honor</i>
<i>the people who made me</i>

02:31.967 --> 02:33.467
<i>the magician I am today.</i>

02:36.133 --> 02:39.300
Let's meet him.
Will you please welcome, Brian Brushwood.

02:39.567 --> 02:41.733
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

02:46.067 --> 02:49.300
Howdy, folks, my name is Brian Brushwood,
and I need a guy from the audience

02:49.367 --> 02:52.433
who's willing to do absolutely anything.

02:52.500 --> 02:53.500
Who's my guy?

02:53.567 --> 02:54.633
(SCATTERED CHEERING)

02:54.700 --> 02:56.667
(LAUGHS) Wait, you're a screamer.
What's your name?

02:56.733 --> 02:58.133
-MAN: Sean.
-Sean, get on up here.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.100
Let's make some noise for Sean
as he comes up here onstage.

03:00.167 --> 03:01.900
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

03:04.000 --> 03:05.167
Good to see you, buddy.

03:05.233 --> 03:06.267
Let me get you over on this side.

03:06.333 --> 03:09.167
Here's the thing. I need somebody willing
to do absolutely anything,

03:09.233 --> 03:12.700
because we are going to do
a vanish and commit a crime.

03:12.767 --> 03:14.900
Like all good crimes, it involves money.

03:14.967 --> 03:17.167
You got 3,000 $1 bills to pick from.

03:17.233 --> 03:19.667
Reach in there, pick any stack you want.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.967
You happy with that one?
You want to change your mind?

03:22.033 --> 03:23.100
Last chance.

03:23.167 --> 03:24.367
-I think this is it.
-Okay, good.

03:24.433 --> 03:25.867
Do me a favor.
I want you to riffle through

03:25.933 --> 03:27.067
the front of that stack,

03:27.133 --> 03:29.633
make sure all the serial numbers
are different.

03:29.733 --> 03:31.533
Everything look good?

03:32.500 --> 03:33.800
-Yup.
-Perfect, hold it in your hand

03:33.867 --> 03:34.933
with the backs on top.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.267
I want you to pull off
the top bill just like so.

03:37.333 --> 03:38.800
Hold on to that one. That one's yours.

03:38.867 --> 03:40.600
The rest I want you to give
to these gentlemen,

03:40.667 --> 03:43.067
which my lawyer promised me
is not technically a bribe.

03:43.133 --> 03:46.033
-Just toss that on over there.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

03:46.100 --> 03:47.233
Thank you.

03:47.300 --> 03:50.567
Every vanish involves
four fundamental aspects.

03:50.633 --> 03:52.167
So we're gonna start by having you

03:52.233 --> 03:54.500
print your name nice
and neat over the back of that bill

03:54.567 --> 03:56.033
right over the "O-N-E" on there.

03:56.100 --> 03:57.200
Neatness counts.

03:57.267 --> 03:58.433
Make sure it's nice and small.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.800
Every vanish has four
fundamental characteristics.

04:00.867 --> 04:04.033
You have to have an object
selected, identified, lost,

04:04.100 --> 04:05.200
and then found.

04:05.267 --> 04:06.567
We've selected a single dollar bill.

04:06.633 --> 04:09.167
We are identifying it
with your name printed on it.

04:09.233 --> 04:11.433
Now we're gonna go a step
farther with the serial number.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.233
I want this half of the audience

04:13.300 --> 04:14.400
to remember the first half.

04:14.467 --> 04:17.632
Read the first half of the serial number
nice and loud to these guys.

04:17.700 --> 04:19.666
"G-0-3-1-0."

04:19.733 --> 04:20.800
Say it back.

04:20.867 --> 04:23.067
AUDIENCE: G-0-3-1-0.

04:23.133 --> 04:24.333
BRUSHWOOD: Remember that.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.500
Second half for these guys.

04:25.567 --> 04:27.700
"9-2-1-3-E."

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
AUDIENCE: 9-2-1-3-E.

04:30.533 --> 04:32.133
Perfect. Sean, I want you to fold that.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.433
With the serial numbers on the inside,
fold it in half,

04:34.500 --> 04:37.133
and then I want you to fold it in half
a second time.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.067
And then finally, fold it
in half one more time,

04:39.133 --> 04:40.633
so you have a nice little square,

04:40.700 --> 04:41.800
one eighth of a bill looking at you.

04:41.867 --> 04:43.000
Everything look good?

04:43.067 --> 04:44.667
And... Square one eighth of a bill.

04:44.733 --> 04:45.900
BRUSHWOOD: Perfect, boom!

04:45.967 --> 04:48.900
Two aspects done, have an object selected
and identified.

04:48.967 --> 04:50.633
This is where stuff gets interesting.

04:50.700 --> 04:52.633
We are going to vanish your bill.

04:52.700 --> 04:53.767
Now, here's the thing.

04:53.833 --> 04:57.167
If you believe in magic,
what you are witnessing

04:57.233 --> 05:00.333
is an astonishing vanish
in which your bill

05:00.400 --> 05:03.500
is vanishing into a magical
puff of plasma.

05:03.567 --> 05:07.533
If you don't believe in magic,
you're witnessing a violation

05:07.600 --> 05:09.600
of Title 18, Section 333,

05:09.667 --> 05:12.767
-punishable by up to $100 fine.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

05:12.833 --> 05:14.067
And six months in prison.

05:15.667 --> 05:18.100
Perfect. Now, uh,
it's still there, though, right?

05:18.167 --> 05:19.767
We got the ashes,
so I'm gonna chop this up

05:19.833 --> 05:22.067
like I'm a methed-out Rachael Ray.

05:22.133 --> 05:23.233
-There we go.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

05:23.300 --> 05:25.133
I'm gonna move these right inside there.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.767
Everything's looking good to me.

05:26.833 --> 05:28.600
Now we get to the most important part.

05:28.667 --> 05:32.100
Sean, do you prefer apple sauce
or chocolate pudding?

05:32.667 --> 05:33.733
Chocolate pudding.

05:33.800 --> 05:34.800
Dude, man of my own heart.

05:34.867 --> 05:35.933
Here we go. We're gonna grab this.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.067
We'll just give it the...

05:37.133 --> 05:39.400
Oh, that's lovely. There we go.

05:39.467 --> 05:40.700
I'm gonna mix this up here.

05:40.767 --> 05:44.267
Some people think I'm doing,
like, a magic ashes switcheroo,

05:44.333 --> 05:46.200
to which I say, "That's dumb."

05:46.267 --> 05:47.700
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Okay, do me a favor.

05:47.767 --> 05:49.067
Just taste that, taste it.

05:49.533 --> 05:51.233
(CROWD GROANING)

05:51.300 --> 05:52.667
Tastes fine, right? Nothing weird?

05:52.733 --> 05:54.000
Yeah, do me a favor, polish that off.

05:54.067 --> 05:55.233
Something amazing's gonna happen.

05:55.300 --> 05:57.467
The faster you eat that,
the louder they'll cheer, watch.

05:58.167 --> 05:59.900
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

06:05.900 --> 06:06.900
It's fine, right?

06:08.367 --> 06:09.833
Three phases down.

06:09.900 --> 06:12.767
We've had an item selected, identified,
and I would say

06:12.833 --> 06:14.533
very thoroughly lost.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.700
I think we can agree, Sean,
that at this point,

06:16.800 --> 06:19.367
it would be extraordinarily difficult
for me to retrieve

06:19.433 --> 06:21.067
your dollar bill.

06:21.367 --> 06:22.600
Yup. Definitely.

06:23.067 --> 06:24.700
I want you to walk around.

06:24.767 --> 06:26.100
(LAUGHING)

06:26.733 --> 06:28.400
I want you to walk around
to the front of this gurney.

06:28.467 --> 06:29.700
Plant your butt right here.

06:29.767 --> 06:31.100
You're gonna put your head
down at this end,

06:31.167 --> 06:34.167
your feet down at the other end,
which sort of happens by default.

06:34.233 --> 06:35.367
There we go.

06:35.433 --> 06:37.400
And I want you to take a deep breath,
pull your shirt

06:37.467 --> 06:38.567
all the way up to your chest.

06:38.633 --> 06:40.033
-All right.
-Hello, ladies.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.167
Right on.

06:41.233 --> 06:42.233
-(LAUGHING)
-(AUDIENCE HOOTING)

06:42.300 --> 06:43.400
Relax, relax, relax.

06:43.467 --> 06:44.500
You're flexing.

06:44.567 --> 06:46.700
And in fact, I want you to rest
your arms right there on top.

06:46.767 --> 06:47.833
Perfect.

06:47.900 --> 06:50.100
And I apologize, this...
I gotta wash you down.

06:50.167 --> 06:51.967
This water's a little bit cold.

06:52.033 --> 06:54.433
-Here's... Sorry about...
-It is cold.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.167
(LAUGHING)

06:56.233 --> 06:58.867
All right, this part will feel
a little bit weird.

07:03.033 --> 07:04.233
Okay.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.433
(LAUGHING) All right.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.533
Hold on. Let me get inside.

07:09.300 --> 07:10.300
There we go.

07:10.967 --> 07:12.167
-(CROWD GROANING)
-That can't be good.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.300
Grab a little bit of...

07:14.367 --> 07:16.000
That's weird.

07:16.067 --> 07:18.067
Wait, why would you...

07:18.133 --> 07:19.733
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait, Sean.

07:20.667 --> 07:23.367
If... If you look inside
the, uh, balloon,

07:23.433 --> 07:25.333
there's something in there.
Do me a favor, I want you to...

07:25.400 --> 07:27.133
I want you to pinch that right there.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.267
I'm gonna try to cut this...

07:28.333 --> 07:29.633
-Actually just with my teeth.
-Lot of lube there.

07:29.700 --> 07:30.767
There we go.

07:30.833 --> 07:31.867
-(LAUGHS)
-That's yours to keep.

07:31.933 --> 07:32.933
(CHUCKLES)

07:33.000 --> 07:35.333
Sean. First of all,
do you guys remember the first half

07:35.400 --> 07:36.700
of the serial number?

07:36.767 --> 07:40.000
AUDIENCE: G-0-3-1-0.

07:40.067 --> 07:42.300
G-0-3-1-0. What's the second half?

07:42.367 --> 07:44.700
ALL: 9-2-1-3-E.

07:44.767 --> 07:45.867
Close enough for me.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.767
Finally, Sean, can you verify,
is that your name printed

07:47.833 --> 07:48.833
in the middle of the bill?

07:48.900 --> 07:49.900
That's my name.

07:49.967 --> 07:52.367
Let's hear it for Sean.
He absolutely swang it.

07:52.433 --> 07:54.533
Fantastic job there, buddy.

07:56.067 --> 07:58.333
I'm almost certain that'll wash out.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.733
(LAUGHING)

07:59.800 --> 08:02.100
-Sean, everyone.
-ROSS: Sean, everybody.

08:02.167 --> 08:04.667
ROSS: What a sport.
Nice work, thank you.

08:07.233 --> 08:08.867
Well, that was incredible.

08:08.933 --> 08:11.200
Where did you study medicine?
'Cause that was quite something.

08:11.267 --> 08:12.667
The Philippines, right?

08:12.733 --> 08:13.933
(BOTH LAUGHING)

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
I think... I don't know how you did this,
but I think I now know

08:16.067 --> 08:17.800
-how Penn lost all that weight.
-That's right.

08:18.233 --> 08:20.033
So the guys are deliberating now.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.767
Penn and Teller are talking
about what they've just seen

08:21.833 --> 08:22.867
and whether they know how it's done.

08:22.933 --> 08:24.667
How confident do you feel
about fooling them, Brian?

08:24.733 --> 08:26.900
Uh, on a scale of one to 10?

08:26.967 --> 08:28.600
-Yeah.
-Uh, negative five.

08:28.833 --> 08:30.567
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

08:30.767 --> 08:32.366
I just want to make them smile.

08:32.433 --> 08:33.567
They're smiling right now.

08:34.433 --> 08:36.799
ROSS: Well, that's the worst smile
I've ever seen in my entire life.

08:37.033 --> 08:38.667
Looking over at Penn and Teller,

08:38.732 --> 08:40.933
I can see they've come to
the end of their deliberation,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.799
so I'm gonna throw now to Penn
and find out how well you did.

08:43.900 --> 08:46.067
-Penn, what do you have to say?
-We are huge fans

08:46.133 --> 08:47.333
before you even came out here,

08:47.400 --> 08:48.867
and the bribe did not hurt.

08:50.100 --> 08:53.567
We did psychic surgery,
which is what you were doing there,

08:53.633 --> 08:55.567
on Conan O'Brien's show,

08:55.633 --> 08:59.367
and Teller did the moves
to reach in and pull the stuff

08:59.433 --> 09:02.333
out of Conan's stomach, and, uh...

09:03.900 --> 09:05.300
I think you did it better.

09:05.367 --> 09:06.633
(LAUGHING)

09:07.600 --> 09:08.633
BRUSHWOOD: I'll accept that.

09:08.867 --> 09:10.100
(LAUGHS)

09:11.600 --> 09:14.100
We do know... We do know how that's done.

09:14.167 --> 09:18.667
We also... We have a pretty good
idea of the serial number.

09:18.733 --> 09:21.200
We don't want to give away too much there.

09:21.267 --> 09:22.967
-BRUSHWOOD: Sure.
-But you used a technique

09:23.033 --> 09:27.100
at the very end to have him
verify the bill...

09:27.167 --> 09:29.200
-BRUSHWOOD: Sure.
-...that is one of my favorite

09:29.267 --> 09:31.067
techniques in magic.

09:31.133 --> 09:34.033
Could you have made it work
with your name as well

09:34.100 --> 09:35.267
or with just Sean's name?

09:35.333 --> 09:36.433
Yeah, I think so.

09:36.500 --> 09:39.400
I mean, some people want to see
the bill after I'm done.

09:39.467 --> 09:41.067
-Yeah.
-(LAUGHING)

09:44.500 --> 09:45.533
And are you happy?

09:45.600 --> 09:47.433
You're convinced they know
what they're talking about?

09:47.500 --> 09:48.633
They know what you know

09:48.700 --> 09:50.533
-that we don't necessarily know...
-Oh, they know that I know

09:50.600 --> 09:52.133
that they know that we all know.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.667
That's... Well, as long as you
know that, then I know

09:53.733 --> 09:54.900
that you're happy to know that.

09:54.967 --> 09:56.000
(LAUGHS) Yes.

09:56.067 --> 09:57.433
Ladies and gentlemen,
it was a great act, wasn't it?

09:57.900 --> 09:59.733
-(CROWD APPLAUDING AND CHEERING)
-ROSS: Mr. Brian Brushwood.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.267
BRUSHWOOD: Thanks, guys.
ROSS: Nice job, Brian.

10:01.333 --> 10:02.667
Thank you so much. Take care.

10:05.033 --> 10:06.133
Let's meet our next act.

10:08.600 --> 10:12.967
Hi, my name is Simon Pierro,
and I'm the digital magician,

10:13.033 --> 10:15.633
and this is my helium app.

10:21.833 --> 10:25.033
<i>Digital magic is taking advantage</i>
<i>from the best of traditional magic</i>

10:25.100 --> 10:28.367
<i>and blending in some</i>
<i>of the technology that people</i>

10:28.433 --> 10:29.533
<i>are not familiar with.</i>

10:30.700 --> 10:31.700
Oh.

10:31.967 --> 10:33.467
I love any kind of honest reaction.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.567
<i>Some people freak out,</i>
<i>some people silently</i>

10:35.633 --> 10:37.167
just being puzzled. "What are you doing?"

10:37.233 --> 10:40.167
<i>I really laugh when people say,</i>
<i>"What you did is clever,</i>

10:40.233 --> 10:41.233
<i>"and I haven't seen it before."</i>

10:41.300 --> 10:43.367
In my magic, I use sleight of hand.

10:43.433 --> 10:44.533
<i>I use misdirection.</i>

10:44.600 --> 10:47.167
<i>I use basically everything that I learned</i>
<i>from traditional magic.</i>

10:47.233 --> 10:50.167
<i>The great thing about technology</i>
<i>is that it's growing so fast,</i>

10:50.233 --> 10:53.600
so whatever new features come out,
I will make a magic trick out of them.

10:54.433 --> 10:56.467
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

10:59.067 --> 11:02.300
We stand on the exciting
frontier where technology

11:02.367 --> 11:03.433
and magic meet.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.767
Our next performer,
who lives in Berlin, refers to himself

11:05.833 --> 11:07.233
as a digital magician,

11:07.300 --> 11:09.367
which was great news for us,
since we didn't have to fly him in

11:09.433 --> 11:11.867
from Germany, we just downloaded him...

11:11.933 --> 11:13.000
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-...legally.

11:13.067 --> 11:15.167
Please welcome Simon Pierro.

11:15.600 --> 11:16.767
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING)

11:16.833 --> 11:18.367
Thank you.

11:20.067 --> 11:21.700
First of all, it's such a great honor.

11:21.767 --> 11:25.667
You... You invited me over
from Germany to perform for you,

11:25.733 --> 11:29.067
and I brought my tablet computer with me,
because the moment I bought it,

11:29.133 --> 11:30.500
it fooled me all the time.

11:30.833 --> 11:35.100
So, for example, if I go through
like this, this might happen.

11:35.467 --> 11:36.467
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

11:37.167 --> 11:38.167
But don't worry.

11:38.833 --> 11:41.100
What I learned, it's not broken.

11:41.167 --> 11:42.900
Can you see that string?

11:42.967 --> 11:44.033
Yeah, can you?

11:44.100 --> 11:46.100
So, thanks to this...

11:46.167 --> 11:50.333
I stop it...
I have access to a whole new set of apps,

11:50.400 --> 11:52.433
and they're all a bit better
than the old ones.

11:53.367 --> 11:55.033
So, thanks to this...

11:55.100 --> 11:56.933
(APPLAUDING)

11:58.067 --> 12:00.300
I can share some pictures
from my last vacation.

12:00.900 --> 12:03.267
It's just about 2,000.

12:03.333 --> 12:05.167
But don't worry,
I won't show you all of them.

12:05.233 --> 12:07.133
Just got the overview, and that way,

12:07.200 --> 12:08.633
I can easily print them.

12:10.100 --> 12:11.400
That is me.

12:12.600 --> 12:13.600
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

12:15.200 --> 12:19.733
For the tennis players out here,
this is a perfect app to have.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.233
If you just bring it
to the right size, like this,

12:22.300 --> 12:24.667
you can easily use your tablet

12:24.733 --> 12:25.800
as a tennis racket.

12:27.700 --> 12:28.733
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

12:30.500 --> 12:33.933
This might even save you
some bucks because you don't have

12:34.000 --> 12:35.067
to buy a new ball again.

12:35.133 --> 12:36.533
You can simply recycle

12:36.600 --> 12:39.033
by putting it back,
and whenever you want to,

12:39.100 --> 12:40.533
all you have to do...

12:40.600 --> 12:41.667
And that's easy to remember...

12:41.733 --> 12:44.367
Just do a little double tap.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.133
There we go.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.833
(APPLAUDING)

12:50.967 --> 12:55.467
Everyone complains about the weather,
but nobody does anything against it,

12:55.533 --> 12:58.833
so I thought,
"Let's create the right weather app."

Most frequent asked question...
No, I cannot take her out of the iPad.

13:11.633 --> 13:15.133
Anyway, when I was invited to come here,
I thought I should bring you

13:15.200 --> 13:17.333
something from my...

13:17.400 --> 13:19.133
From my home country,

13:19.200 --> 13:21.800
and what we are famous for, and now,
I know you guys,

13:21.867 --> 13:25.000
you don't drink, but at least...

13:25.433 --> 13:26.867
I brought the app with me,

13:28.300 --> 13:31.933
and it looks like this... For the moment.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.733
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-But, well, as you don't drink,

13:34.800 --> 13:37.333
I have my favorite drinking buddy with me.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.900
Please, are you ready, Jonathan?

13:38.967 --> 13:40.333
-I'm ready to go.
-Please.

14:10.233 --> 14:11.867
So, that is my favorite app,

14:11.933 --> 14:14.567
but there's another one
that is pretty popular these days.

14:14.633 --> 14:16.300
It's about a selfie.

14:16.367 --> 14:19.333
So, what I thought I would do now,
I go into the audience,

14:19.400 --> 14:21.767
and there are lots of beautiful people
here tonight.

14:21.833 --> 14:23.633
Let's have a selfie, please.

14:23.700 --> 14:25.633
If you could, you two,
on a selfie with me,

14:25.700 --> 14:26.700
that would be nice.

14:27.233 --> 14:28.233
And smile.

a special edition for you,

14:35.833 --> 14:38.767

"The Penn and Teller Selfie App."

14:39.367 --> 14:40.467
So, here it is.

14:40.533 --> 14:43.533
All I have to do now is choose
one of the pictures.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.200
That one looked pretty good.

14:45.967 --> 14:47.533
But this is my iPad.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.300
This is my tablet computer.

14:49.367 --> 14:52.767
This is, you can say,
the tablet computer of my grandma.

14:52.833 --> 14:54.233
It's a picture frame.

14:54.333 --> 14:57.067

my pictures with her.

One second, please.

15:06.200 --> 15:09.933

15:19.967 --> 15:21.500
Simon, that was fabulous.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.833
I think everyone loved the fact
that it's so modern,

15:23.900 --> 15:25.967
it's so up-to-date,
but are there any old techniques

15:26.033 --> 15:28.167
in there that you've just
updated, or is it all new stuff?

15:28.233 --> 15:33.867
Well, usually, I take all the techniques
from traditional magic that can help me

15:33.933 --> 15:36.233
to improve my digital magic,
so I'm taking the best

15:36.300 --> 15:38.500
-from two worlds, basically.
-Well, it was fabulous.

15:38.567 --> 15:40.267
I think that was probably
the first digital magician

15:40.333 --> 15:41.367
we've had on the show.

15:41.433 --> 15:42.433
Penn, Teller?

15:42.500 --> 15:43.867
Absolutely new.

15:43.933 --> 15:45.000
Everything's fresh.

15:45.067 --> 15:48.967
You can call it film to life,
but it's more that the tablet

15:49.033 --> 15:50.300
is your magic wand.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.600
-Yes.
-I kind of love that,

15:51.667 --> 15:53.133
that everything comes out of that.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.767
We were very good friends
with Jerry Andrus,

15:55.833 --> 15:59.867
and I don't know how important
he was to you as an individual,

15:59.933 --> 16:02.433
but his ball bearing routine...

16:02.500 --> 16:05.700
You owe a lot in the tennis ball routine
to that.

16:05.767 --> 16:10.833
It's wonderful stuff,
but the trick that killed us,

16:11.233 --> 16:13.533
which fooled us completely,

16:13.600 --> 16:14.833
is that final trick.

16:14.900 --> 16:18.800
It's an absolute mind-blower,
and we had no idea about it

16:18.867 --> 16:21.200
when we first saw it.

16:21.267 --> 16:22.367
(LAUGHS)

16:22.433 --> 16:27.000
And that's the problem.
Magicians watch other magicians,

16:27.067 --> 16:31.333
and we watched it,
and we were both fooled by it.

16:31.400 --> 16:35.300
Then we were able to figure out
this brilliant trick at the end,

16:35.367 --> 16:37.767
and I would rather not say
any more about it,

16:37.833 --> 16:39.333
but if you push me, I will.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.967
But it's a wonderful routine.

16:41.033 --> 16:45.633
I'm telling you, you absolutely
100% fooled us three weeks ago

16:45.700 --> 16:46.767
but not today.

-Simon, let me just check

16:51.700 --> 16:53.167
that you're happy

16:54.033 --> 16:57.233
that your digital magic, due to
the wonders of digital sharing...

16:57.700 --> 17:00.633
'Cause they saw it online a while ago...
You were busted by that

17:00.700 --> 17:01.700
and that you didn't fool them.

17:01.767 --> 17:02.933
That's fair. That's good.

<i>and I'm a male model.</i>

<i>When I first started to make</i>
<i>the transition from modeling</i>

17:25.833 --> 17:28.099

I went to my spiritual adviser,

17:28.166 --> 17:30.000
<i>and he said I should take one trick</i>

17:30.067 --> 17:32.133
<i>and work on it and work on it</i>
<i>until I can do it better</i>

17:32.200 --> 17:33.900
<i>than anybody in the world.</i>

17:33.967 --> 17:35.133

17:35.200 --> 17:37.867
"How does a male model
find time to do magic?"

17:38.767 --> 17:39.767
Well, I make the time.

<i>People in the media don't</i>
<i>take me seriously as a magician.</i>

17:58.867 --> 18:02.100
It's hard to forget how good-looking
our next potential fooler is,

18:02.167 --> 18:04.567
mainly because his name serves
as a constant reminder.

18:04.633 --> 18:05.700
Here he is. Ladies and gentlemen,

18:05.767 --> 18:08.167
welcome Handsome Jack.

18:08.233 --> 18:11.167
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

18:11.233 --> 18:13.000
Hello, Las Vegas!

18:16.300 --> 18:20.400
Prepare yourselves for
the Handsome Jack Experience.

18:20.467 --> 18:24.433
Anybody who does not want to get
his mind blown out of his ass

18:24.500 --> 18:26.500
should leave the room now.

18:26.567 --> 18:28.233
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

18:28.300 --> 18:30.200
All right, you've been warned.

18:30.267 --> 18:33.133
Now, when the producers
called me about being on this show,

18:33.200 --> 18:36.233
found out it's a 60-minute show,
so I prepared

18:36.300 --> 18:39.400
one hour of kickass magic
for you fine folks.

18:39.467 --> 18:40.700
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

18:40.767 --> 18:44.167
Then I get here,
I find out the producers have hired

18:44.233 --> 18:45.433
a bunch of other magicians,

18:45.500 --> 18:47.067
and I get five minutes,

18:47.133 --> 18:50.867
because apparently, nobody cares
about ratings around here.

18:50.967 --> 18:52.300
(LAUGHING)

18:52.367 --> 18:55.967
So, I even printed up a bunch
of Handsome Jack Experience handbills.

18:56.067 --> 18:58.133
I was going to distribute them
to everybody.

18:58.200 --> 19:03.700
Gives you the complete rundown
of everything I was going to do tonight.

19:03.767 --> 19:07.300
It even tells you everything you need
to know about Handsome Jack.

19:07.367 --> 19:10.600
Ladies, once you go Jack,

19:10.667 --> 19:12.867
you never go back.

19:12.933 --> 19:14.867
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND LAUGHING)
-JACK: That's right.

19:15.233 --> 19:18.067
So, since we're a little pressed
for time tonight,

19:18.133 --> 19:20.800
I will just have to tell you about
the things you won't be seeing me

19:20.867 --> 19:24.367
do tonight.
Oh, can't do this one.

19:25.267 --> 19:29.000
You won't see me doing
"There's a hair in my hat."

19:29.067 --> 19:31.200
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Ah. Oh, this is a classic.

19:32.967 --> 19:35.067
"The mighty Cheez Whiz."

19:35.633 --> 19:36.667
Oh.

19:36.733 --> 19:40.033
Won't have time to see-saw a woman in two.

19:40.100 --> 19:42.400
Oh, this is a good one.

19:42.467 --> 19:43.967
"The diner's dilemma."

19:44.033 --> 19:46.833
That's a tribute to civil rights.

19:46.900 --> 19:47.967
(LAUGHING)

19:48.033 --> 19:50.667
Oh, no, we've just got time
for one this evening,

19:50.733 --> 19:54.933
and that is, oh,
"The torn and restored handbill."

19:55.000 --> 19:56.367
Perfect.

19:56.433 --> 19:58.367
So, here we go.

20:25.067 --> 20:26.667
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

20:30.633 --> 20:32.567
You know what? Don't say anything.

20:33.067 --> 20:34.500
I don't care if I fooled ya.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.400
I'll let someone else win the car.

20:36.700 --> 20:38.267
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Oh, what's that?

20:38.333 --> 20:39.500
-The prize is not a car?
-ROSS: No.

20:39.567 --> 20:42.567
Oh, well,
then I really don't care if I fooled them.

20:42.633 --> 20:43.633
(LAUGHS)

20:43.700 --> 20:44.867
You know, one of my mottos
has always been,

20:44.933 --> 20:47.200
"Magic is fun
once you know how it's done,"

20:47.400 --> 20:49.267
so I'm just gonna show everybody
how I did that.

20:49.333 --> 20:51.833
To do this,
I needed a special magician's device

20:51.900 --> 20:54.067
called a grappler.
I've got a grappler up my sleeve here.

20:54.133 --> 20:55.900
I'll show it to you.

20:58.633 --> 21:03.700
Now, I had an extra one of those
handbills hidden inside the grappler.

21:03.767 --> 21:05.867
The grappler's a mechanical device.

21:05.933 --> 21:08.767
It shot the handbill out
of my sleeve into my hand,

21:08.833 --> 21:12.433
and then it grabbed all those torn pieces
and yanked 'em back up my sleeve.

21:12.767 --> 21:15.767
Now, it's mechanical,
but it's not entirely self-working.

21:15.833 --> 21:19.067
It still requires
what we magicians call misdirection.

21:19.533 --> 21:21.367
I'll show you the misdirection
I was using.

21:21.433 --> 21:23.567
In fact, I tell you what,
I will get up on the chair,

21:23.633 --> 21:26.333
so you can all see
the misdirection I was using.

21:26.433 --> 21:30.633
You remember, I took all those torn pieces
and I fanned 'em out like this?

21:30.700 --> 21:33.600
I knew if I was to do a very careful,
deliberate action like that,

21:33.667 --> 21:35.600
you'd all be staring right up here.

21:35.667 --> 21:37.467
And while you were all
staring right up here,

21:37.533 --> 21:42.600
probably none of you noticed
when I went ahead and I dropped my pants.

21:42.667 --> 21:45.000
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING AND CHEERING)

21:45.433 --> 21:50.900
Now, once my pants were down,
I was able to get my knees

21:50.967 --> 21:54.033
hooked together,
and once my knees were hooked together,

21:54.100 --> 21:56.833
because of this cable that runs
up my arm and down my leg,

21:56.900 --> 21:58.533
I was able to get this action going on.

21:58.600 --> 22:01.467
Watch, it starts down here
and ends up over here. Watch.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.133
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

22:04.200 --> 22:05.233
Yeah?

22:05.300 --> 22:06.833
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

22:08.800 --> 22:12.467
So, you can see, it's not the hands
that are quicker than the eye,

22:12.533 --> 22:15.500
it's the knees
that are quicker than the eye.

22:15.567 --> 22:20.967
So, this just proves my motto that magic
is fun once you know how it's done.

22:21.033 --> 22:22.267
Am I right, people?

22:22.333 --> 22:24.800
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING)

22:26.700 --> 22:30.133
There is still a problem
sometimes you can encounter

22:30.200 --> 22:32.533
when you're using the grappler,
and that is sometimes

22:32.600 --> 22:35.667
the people up close,
they can see up your sleeve,

22:35.733 --> 22:39.600
and they can see all
the torn pieces up your sleeve,

22:39.667 --> 22:42.733
and if that happens, well,
then you have to resort

22:42.800 --> 22:46.067
to plan B, and plan B is
what we call,

22:46.467 --> 22:49.267
"Taking care of business,
Handsome Jack style."

22:51.767 --> 22:53.567
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

22:56.233 --> 22:57.333
Thank you.

22:59.400 --> 23:00.700
That is for you.

23:02.133 --> 23:03.800
Handsome Jack, ladies and gentlemen.

23:05.400 --> 23:06.533
ROSS: Fabulous stuff.

23:06.600 --> 23:07.933
When I saw the first part,

23:08.000 --> 23:10.033
I thought, "Okay, I've seen this kind
of thing done before."

23:10.100 --> 23:11.433
-Yeah.
-But never with that kind of setup.

23:11.500 --> 23:12.500
JACK: No.

23:12.567 --> 23:15.000
So, is that the area
which you think will confound, perplex,

23:15.067 --> 23:16.100
and bemuse them?

23:16.267 --> 23:19.033
I just hope anything will confound
or perplex them.

23:19.100 --> 23:20.700
I don't care which part of it.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.033
Okay. I think they're coming to
the end of their deliberations.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.933
-Well, Jack...
-JACK: Yes.

23:25.500 --> 23:31.800
We all know that all we're talking
about is you handing this to Teller.

23:32.167 --> 23:35.567
There's nothing else in the routine
that we are talking about.

23:35.633 --> 23:36.700
Okay.

23:36.767 --> 23:39.533
We also love the fact that you
did the little moves

23:39.600 --> 23:43.833
that you would need to do
to put it together the way

23:43.900 --> 23:47.600
that's been done every time
we've done it in the past,

23:47.667 --> 23:51.833
but then in the last 12 seconds,

23:53.333 --> 23:55.167
you made it really hard for us.

23:55.700 --> 23:58.700
If that final one out of the grappler

23:59.800 --> 24:02.400
had stayed in his hands,

24:02.467 --> 24:04.167
there would have been no problem,

24:04.233 --> 24:07.033
because when you do
a torn and restored newspaper

24:07.133 --> 24:09.067
or a paper, anything like that,

24:09.133 --> 24:10.900
you end up dirty.

24:11.000 --> 24:16.033
Or it's possible that you had
some way at the end

24:16.967 --> 24:22.367
to show us what we thought
was individual pieces but actually wasn't.

24:22.667 --> 24:27.800
If your hands actually came apart
and you showed us separate pieces,

24:27.867 --> 24:29.733
then you, sir, fooled us.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.133
Jack?

24:31.200 --> 24:33.500
Well, if you ever watch the tape again,

24:33.567 --> 24:37.900
you will see I absolutely have
individual pieces that I separate.

24:37.967 --> 24:40.800
They absolutely were individual pieces.

24:40.867 --> 24:41.867
ROSS: Wow.

24:45.133 --> 24:46.133
ROSS: Wow.

24:47.433 --> 24:51.300
PENN: Lulled us
into a false sense of security.

24:51.367 --> 24:54.667
Jack, it must be nice to be
loved for something

24:54.733 --> 24:58.033
which isn't just your genetic good looks
for once in your life.

24:58.100 --> 24:59.600
Yes, I'm not just another pretty face.

24:59.667 --> 25:00.900
Here you go.

25:00.967 --> 25:02.533
-Oh, awesome.
-There is your fabulous trophy.

25:02.600 --> 25:05.400
-Thank you.
-He'll be back here working with the boys

25:05.467 --> 25:07.767
onstage in Las Vegas.

25:07.833 --> 25:09.533
Incredible, wasn't it,
ladies and gentlemen?

25:09.600 --> 25:11.000
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING)

25:11.067 --> 25:13.133
Handsome Jack. He fooled them.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.233
ROSS: Off you go, sir.
JACK: Thank you so much.

25:15.300 --> 25:17.833
So far tonight, one magician has fooled
Penn and Teller

25:17.900 --> 25:19.400
and earned a trip back here to Vegas.

25:19.467 --> 25:22.567
So, let's meet our next contender
and see if they're up to the task.

25:24.700 --> 25:25.733
Hello.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.900
I'm Kyle Knight. This is my wife, Mistie.

25:29.967 --> 25:30.967
<i>We are illusionists.</i>

25:34.667 --> 25:36.033
MISTIE: <i>We live here in Las Vegas.</i>

25:36.100 --> 25:37.933
KYLE: <i>Our neighbors probably think</i>
<i>we're a little bit crazy.</i>

25:38.333 --> 25:39.367
(IMITATES GUNSHOT)

25:39.433 --> 25:41.667
We each perform magic,
separately and together,

25:41.733 --> 25:44.300
<i>and we try to do everything</i>
<i>we do as a partnership.</i>

25:44.367 --> 25:45.533
-That's for me.
-All right.

25:45.600 --> 25:46.700
<i>We're really married to magic.</i>

25:46.767 --> 25:47.800
<i>We're married to the show.</i>

25:47.867 --> 25:49.100
Hit it.

25:49.167 --> 25:50.367
-(ELECTRIC HUMMING)
-There you go.

25:50.433 --> 25:52.533
<i>I'm the boss for the entire hour</i>
<i>of the show,</i>

25:52.600 --> 25:54.600
and Mistie's the boss
for the other 23 hours of the day.

25:56.433 --> 25:58.133
-That's why this is in the garage.
-(LAUGHING)

25:58.367 --> 26:01.367
We have a really unique relationship,
and it works for us.

26:02.567 --> 26:03.933
(GLASS SHATTERING)

26:04.000 --> 26:05.167
You're cleaning that up.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.400
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING)

26:13.767 --> 26:15.300
So, our next act are
a husband and wife team

26:15.367 --> 26:17.833
who know the secrets
to a successful marriage.

26:17.900 --> 26:20.167
One, communication. Two, honesty.

26:20.233 --> 26:21.733
Three, tying each other up

26:21.800 --> 26:24.333
in a bag and throwing away
the key on a regular basis.

26:24.400 --> 26:25.767
Will you please welcome Kyle and Mistie?

26:26.600 --> 26:28.400
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING)

26:29.400 --> 26:30.700
Thank you.

26:32.633 --> 26:34.800
Thank you, I'm Kyle Knight,
and this is my wife, Mistie.

26:34.867 --> 26:38.167
Now, we are illusionists, but we try to
do things just a little bit different.

26:38.233 --> 26:40.733
You see, rather than just having
a box onstage

26:40.800 --> 26:42.867
where it's at a safe distance
from the audience

26:42.933 --> 26:45.433
and we can hide
anything tricky that we want,

26:45.500 --> 26:48.533
we like to let you get up close
and involved, examining things,

26:48.600 --> 26:51.667
so that you can see how fair
everything really is.

26:51.733 --> 26:53.733
Or she may just be saying
that as misdirection,

26:53.800 --> 26:55.333
-I'm not sure, but...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

26:55.400 --> 26:56.867
Before the show, we actually
handed out some rings

26:56.933 --> 26:57.967
to the audience members.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.567
If you have 'em, hold 'em up high.
Perfect, perfect.

26:59.633 --> 27:00.867
I have one final ring here.

27:00.933 --> 27:02.233
Jonathan, would you mind
helping out with this one?

27:02.300 --> 27:03.700
-Hey, I'd love to.
-Awesome, thank you so much.

27:03.767 --> 27:04.900
-Thank you.
-If you go onto

27:04.967 --> 27:06.833
that side over there, yeah.
Your job's gonna be very simple.

27:06.900 --> 27:08.067
Your job's going to be
to examine everything.

27:08.133 --> 27:09.400
-Okay.
-Mainly the rings.

27:09.467 --> 27:10.700
-Okay.
-Mainly the rings.

27:10.767 --> 27:12.033
Step around the backside, Jonathan.

27:12.100 --> 27:13.833
We're gonna place these over top
like this.

27:13.900 --> 27:16.000
They fit inside here.
They lock in place really secure.

27:16.067 --> 27:17.167
I've got some hardware in this pan.

27:17.233 --> 27:19.600
If you wouldn't mind bolting
that on the back as quickly

27:19.667 --> 27:21.000
and as dramatically as you can.

27:21.067 --> 27:22.267
-Sure.
-Perfect, yeah. Just like that.

27:22.333 --> 27:24.467

Here we go. Hit it.

right there?

28:32.033 --> 28:34.200
Pick up the fabric
with me if you wouldn't mind.

-That was fabulous.
-Thank you. Thanks for helping.

28:59.333 --> 29:01.600
Wow, and everything happened so fast.

29:01.667 --> 29:03.267
Penn and Teller are gonna
talk to each other now

29:03.333 --> 29:05.067
and see whether they can work
out how you did what you did

29:05.133 --> 29:07.267
quite as quickly and fantastic as that.

29:07.333 --> 29:10.533

the kind of jaws of death,

29:10.600 --> 29:11.767
that looked terrifying.

29:11.833 --> 29:14.000
We're still deciding
who's gonna go inside it, so...

29:14.067 --> 29:15.433
(LAUGHING)

29:15.500 --> 29:16.700
Yeah, do you...

29:16.767 --> 29:19.067
Who gets final say if it comes
to that, kind of, who does what?

29:19.133 --> 29:21.400
I like to think I do,
but I know I really don't, so...

29:21.467 --> 29:22.467
(LAUGHS)

29:22.533 --> 29:24.000
ROSS: So, you're genuinely in charge
most of the time?

29:24.067 --> 29:25.300
MISTIE: We're a partnership.

29:25.367 --> 29:27.933
ROSS: Did you meet via magic,
or were you already together?

29:28.000 --> 29:29.400
No, we met via magic.

29:29.467 --> 29:32.233
I was performing
out of New Orleans, and she...

29:32.300 --> 29:35.467
And I met him,
and we hit it off and kept in touch,

29:35.533 --> 29:37.067
and I relocated from Mississippi

29:37.133 --> 29:38.867
to Las Vegas,
and we've been together for 12 years.

29:38.967 --> 29:40.067
Well, that's a lovely story.

29:40.133 --> 29:41.933
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

29:45.033 --> 29:47.300
I think Penn and Teller are ready to go.

29:47.433 --> 29:51.467
So many of your escape tricks
try to pretend to be dangerous,

29:51.567 --> 29:52.967
and that always offends me.

29:53.033 --> 29:55.700
What I love about this is
it's a topological mystery,

29:55.767 --> 29:58.500
and that's what it's presented
as, and that's really beautiful.

29:58.567 --> 30:00.400
Like the costume change,
like the way you go,

30:00.467 --> 30:03.033
but I chat too much on this show.
I talk too much.

30:03.100 --> 30:04.967
Teller's gonna explain this one to you.

30:05.033 --> 30:08.100
He's drawn a little diagram

30:08.167 --> 30:10.333
that y'all can look at,

30:10.400 --> 30:14.733
and then maybe Teller will
show it to the camera afterwards here.

30:15.767 --> 30:16.800
(MURMURS)

30:17.233 --> 30:19.667
Well, I do believe that
unfortunately you've...

30:19.733 --> 30:21.933
So, now you can hold that up,
Teller, so that everybody

30:22.000 --> 30:25.667
in the audience can see
very clearly how they...

30:25.733 --> 30:29.300
How they did that and see that clearly.

30:29.367 --> 30:30.733
-There you go.
-There it goes.

30:30.800 --> 30:32.633
If you just figure out
how it's done from there.

30:32.700 --> 30:34.267
Beautifully done though,
beautifully done.

30:34.333 --> 30:35.900
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING)

30:36.033 --> 30:38.100
Mistie, Kyle,
I don't think you fooled them.

30:38.167 --> 30:39.467
I think you're happy
with that explanation?

30:39.533 --> 30:40.733
Oh, that's absolutely fine, yes.

30:40.800 --> 30:42.367
Okay, none of us saw it,
but I think we're gonna have to

30:42.433 --> 30:44.967
take it for granted,
but what we did see was a phenomenal act,

30:45.033 --> 30:46.133
didn't we, ladies and gentlemen?

30:46.200 --> 30:48.900
It was tremendous, fun, and entertaining.

30:48.967 --> 30:53.133
Mistie, Kyle, thank you so much.
That was fabulous.

30:56.900 --> 30:59.500
Now, the only thing crazier
than one man catching a bullet

30:59.733 --> 31:02.833
in his teeth, would be two men
catching bullets in their teeth.

31:02.900 --> 31:04.700
I know what you're thinking,
but three men trying to do it

31:04.767 --> 31:06.633
would just be silly, so I'm gonna go.

31:06.700 --> 31:10.100
And on that note, this is a trick
you should not try at home

31:10.200 --> 31:11.667
or anywhere else for that matter.

31:11.767 --> 31:14.967
Ladies and gentlemen, here they are,
the fabulous Penn and Teller.

31:15.167 --> 31:16.700
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

31:20.133 --> 31:22.600
We're gonna do "The Magic Bullets,"

31:22.667 --> 31:25.133
with a couple of volunteers
from the audience.

31:25.200 --> 31:29.600
We need two people who know guns,
preferably handguns,

31:29.667 --> 31:32.733
preferably .357 Magnums.

31:33.400 --> 31:35.767
Someone who believes very
strongly in the second amendment

31:35.833 --> 31:37.267
to our constitution.

31:37.333 --> 31:38.733
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

31:38.800 --> 31:40.933
And who was never in any way affiliated

31:41.000 --> 31:44.800
with the United States Postal Service.

31:44.867 --> 31:45.867
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

31:45.933 --> 31:46.933
PENN: Who knows guns?

31:47.000 --> 31:48.667
PENN: How do you know guns there, sir?

31:48.900 --> 31:50.000
-I work security.
-PENN: Work security?

31:50.100 --> 31:51.300
-PENN: Do you know revolvers?
-Yes, sir.

31:51.367 --> 31:52.600
PENN: Right up here,
would you please, sir?

31:52.667 --> 31:54.467
One more person
with the same qualifications.

31:54.533 --> 31:55.967
How do you know guns there?

31:56.033 --> 31:58.733
I was in the military,
and I have several weapons at home.

31:58.800 --> 32:00.867
Military? Right up here,
would you please, sir?

32:00.933 --> 32:03.300
Only two rules to the gentlemen onstage.

32:03.367 --> 32:07.467
Rule number one,
try to use the microphone when you speak,

32:07.533 --> 32:12.133
and rule number two,
do not cross that yellow line.

32:12.200 --> 32:13.800
-What's your name, please, sir?
-Dane.

32:13.867 --> 32:15.100
Dane, take the microphone there, Dane.

32:15.167 --> 32:16.933
Gonna move you right over here
if you'll forgive me.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.433
Just don't cross that yellow line, Dane.

32:19.500 --> 32:20.533
What's your name, please, sir?

32:20.600 --> 32:22.033
-My name's Chris.
-Chris,

32:22.100 --> 32:23.433
and what branch of the military, Chris?

32:23.500 --> 32:24.500
-Army.
-Army, thank you so much

32:24.567 --> 32:25.633
for your service, Chris, thank you.

32:25.700 --> 32:26.733
CHRIS: Thank you very much.

32:26.800 --> 32:27.800
(AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)

32:27.900 --> 32:29.800
We have Dane and we have
Chris to do "The Magic Bullets."

32:29.867 --> 32:32.500
We start with bullets
that aren't magic at all.

32:32.567 --> 32:36.000
Just ordinary purse of bullets.

32:36.067 --> 32:38.133
Dane, pick one of the bullets
from my purse, please.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.000
Chris, any one from Teller's purse.

32:40.067 --> 32:42.600
Examine those bullets carefully.
Is that a real bullet over there, Chris?

32:42.667 --> 32:43.700
Yes, sir.

32:43.767 --> 32:44.800
Is that a real bullet there, Dane?

32:44.867 --> 32:45.867
Absolutely.

32:45.933 --> 32:47.433
Could you sign the bullet, just the tip?

32:47.500 --> 32:49.433
Make sure every quadrant has something,
I don't care what,

32:49.500 --> 32:51.867
as long as you can recognize it
from every angle.

32:51.933 --> 32:54.333
Filigrees, you can illuminate
the first letter.

32:55.467 --> 32:57.667
You'll recognize that when you
see it again, won't you, Dane?

32:57.733 --> 32:59.800
-Yep.
-As you can see,

32:59.867 --> 33:03.067
we have a slightly larger canvas,
as it were, in the casing.

33:03.800 --> 33:08.333
Gonna get these gentlemen to
draw whatever they want on that casing.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.867
What do you want to draw
on the casing there, Chris?

33:11.133 --> 33:12.800
I don't know, I'll just draw
a flower on there.

33:12.867 --> 33:14.633
Flower. What do you want to draw
on the casing there, Dane?

33:14.933 --> 33:16.067
How about a lightning bolt?

33:16.133 --> 33:17.167
A lightning bolt.

33:17.233 --> 33:18.567
Taking care of business like Elvis.

33:18.633 --> 33:22.933
Okay, draw your blue lightning bolt
right there.

33:23.967 --> 33:25.100
Nicely done.

33:25.167 --> 33:30.133
So you see, under his initials,
he's drawn a lightning bolt.

33:30.200 --> 33:33.200
It's primitive but shows
a great deal of promise.

33:33.267 --> 33:34.300
There, you can see.

33:34.367 --> 33:37.300
I'm sure he's drawn a fine flower.

33:38.067 --> 33:39.533
Beautiful flower.

33:39.600 --> 33:41.033
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Beautiful flower.

33:41.100 --> 33:44.833
I doubt either of you
is a glazier, but all the same,

33:44.900 --> 33:46.100
would you examine that piece of glass?

33:46.167 --> 33:47.300
That's your piece of glass.

33:47.367 --> 33:48.500
-(CLINKING)
-Give a tap for the microphone,

33:48.567 --> 33:49.900
makes our sound man crazy.

33:49.967 --> 33:52.367
Is that a real piece of glass
over there, Chris?

33:52.433 --> 33:53.967
-Yes, sir.
-Real piece of glass there, Dane?

33:54.033 --> 33:55.067
-Yes, sir.
-Here's what gonna happen

33:55.133 --> 33:57.867
to this bullet,
which is signed on the tip by Dane,

33:57.933 --> 34:00.600
with the lightning bolt
drawn on the casing by Dane.

34:00.667 --> 34:01.833
We're gonna move the tip,

34:01.900 --> 34:04.700
just the part that travels,
the copper-covered lead part,

34:04.767 --> 34:06.333
to that side of the stage.

34:06.600 --> 34:09.800
Take that bullet,
which is signed on the tip by Chris

34:09.867 --> 34:11.300
with a flower

34:11.400 --> 34:13.766
drawn on the casing by Chris.

34:13.900 --> 34:16.132
We're gonna move the tip,
just the part that travels,

34:16.199 --> 34:19.467
the copper-covered lead part,
to this side of the stage.

34:20.033 --> 34:24.632
But we're gonna do that all
without anyone crossing that yellow line.

34:25.433 --> 34:26.800
It's called "The Magic Bullets."

34:26.867 --> 34:29.132
For The Magic Bullets,
we need magic wands,

34:29.199 --> 34:34.400
and we're using Colt Python .357 Magnum
magic wands.

34:34.600 --> 34:37.833
It's exactly what you can buy
in any gun shop with the one addition

34:37.900 --> 34:42.467
of a laser sight, which only a nut would
put on a handgun.

34:42.533 --> 34:43.699
(LAUGHS)

34:43.766 --> 34:46.167
Like you gentlemen to examine
these weapons, please.

34:46.233 --> 34:47.567
Check that out, would you please, Dane?

34:47.632 --> 34:51.367
Make sure the barrel has not
been obstructed in any way.

34:52.033 --> 34:53.900
-Is that a real gun over there, Chris?
-Yes, sir.

34:53.967 --> 34:55.433
-Is that a real gun there, Dane?
-Yes.

34:55.632 --> 34:57.267
Because others have handled
these weapons,

34:57.333 --> 34:59.167
we're gonna give a quick once-over.

34:59.433 --> 35:01.633
And now we're going to load them up.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.367
Step right beside me,
would you please, Dane?

35:03.433 --> 35:05.667
I want you to see your initials.
Want you to see if I rotate that,

35:05.733 --> 35:07.267
-your lightning bolt. See it right there?
-Yep.

35:07.333 --> 35:09.633
Put your finger on the top
of that, would you please, Dane?

35:09.700 --> 35:11.033
-See my hand's empty?
-Yep.

35:11.100 --> 35:13.600
Gonna rotate and click it
to next round fired,

35:13.700 --> 35:17.033
and Teller and Chris are doing similarly
on their side of the stage.

35:17.100 --> 35:20.667
Now, Dane and Chris, I suggest
you keep your eye on these guns,

35:20.767 --> 35:24.467
because these bullets,
they have your names on 'em, don't they?

35:24.533 --> 35:26.000
-Yeah, they really do.
-(LAUGHING)

35:26.067 --> 35:28.933
Now, Chris, the next hump
of the show gets a little hairy.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.300
I want to get you out of harm's way.

35:30.367 --> 35:32.967
If you'd be kind enough, please,
Chris, to the bottom of the stairs there,

35:33.033 --> 35:34.033
we'll set you up right there.

35:34.100 --> 35:35.600
Right to the bottom
of the stairs over there, Chris.

35:35.667 --> 35:38.200
Dane, you've already guessed,
right over to the symmetrical position,

35:38.267 --> 35:40.067
right over here
at the bottom of the stairs.

35:40.133 --> 35:42.267
There's a moment this trick
that gets a wee bit loud.

35:42.333 --> 35:44.100
We're gonna warn you before that moment.

35:44.167 --> 35:47.333
I'll say the word, "Ears."
I'll say it once.

35:47.400 --> 35:49.800
I'll say it loudly. I'll say it clearly.

35:49.867 --> 35:51.667
When I say the word, "Ears,"

35:51.733 --> 35:52.933
please put your fingers in your ears.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.333
Nothing fancy.

35:54.400 --> 35:55.400
Just like this.

35:55.467 --> 35:58.233
Just like if Clay Aiken were
singing onstage or something.

35:58.300 --> 35:59.567
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

35:59.633 --> 36:01.033
And don't be cavalier about this.

36:01.100 --> 36:04.133
Your hearing is very precious.
You don't want to jeopardize it

36:04.200 --> 36:05.433
for the likes of us.

36:06.067 --> 36:08.833
Now, a lot of people are
very frightened by handguns,

36:08.933 --> 36:10.767
but there are four rules.

36:10.833 --> 36:13.267
If everyone were to follow
these four rules,

36:13.333 --> 36:15.967
no one would ever be hurt by a handgun

36:16.033 --> 36:17.567
accidentally.

36:17.633 --> 36:21.000
Rule number one, always treat every gun

36:21.067 --> 36:24.100
as though it were loaded,
unless you yourself

36:24.167 --> 36:25.500
have checked it.

36:25.567 --> 36:28.367
Rule number two,
always be sure of your target.

36:28.433 --> 36:29.933
Rule number three,

36:30.000 --> 36:33.833
keep your finger off the trigger
till your sights are on the target.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.867
And rule number four,

36:35.933 --> 36:39.933
never point a gun at anything

36:40.000 --> 36:42.800
unless you intend to destroy it.

36:44.200 --> 36:46.000

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

37:29.033 --> 37:34.633
Now, Chris, at the beginning
of this bit, you signed a bullet

37:34.700 --> 37:37.867
and loaded it into that weapon
right there,

37:37.933 --> 37:39.233
-is that right, Chris?
-Yes, sir.

37:39.300 --> 37:41.400
Step up to the yellow line.

37:41.467 --> 37:43.500
Don't cross it, just hang 10.

37:43.933 --> 37:48.000
Hey, Chris, see a, uh, bullet in my teeth?

37:48.067 --> 37:49.367
CHRIS: Yes, sir, I do.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.667
Hold your hand out, so I can spit in it.

37:55.233 --> 37:56.567
Recognize that bullet, Chris?

37:56.700 --> 37:57.733
Yes, I do.

37:57.800 --> 37:59.333
-Is that the one you signed?
-Yes, it was.

37:59.400 --> 38:00.967
I don't know much
about forensics, Chris,

38:01.033 --> 38:02.533
but has it been through the barrel
of a gun?

38:02.600 --> 38:03.733
Yes, it has.

38:03.800 --> 38:05.533
-Rifling, powder burns, so on?
-Yes.

38:05.600 --> 38:06.867
Stand right there,
would you please, Chris?

38:07.167 --> 38:09.567
Dane, at the beginning of
this bit when we first met,

38:09.633 --> 38:11.933
you signed a bullet,
loaded that weapon right there,

38:12.000 --> 38:13.700
-is that right, Dane?
-Yes.

38:13.767 --> 38:15.500
That yellow line, don't cross it.

38:15.567 --> 38:17.167
-See a bullet in Teller's teeth?
-Yes.

38:17.233 --> 38:18.567
Let him spit in your hand,
would you please, sir?

38:19.733 --> 38:20.800
Sir!

38:20.900 --> 38:22.467
Do you recognize that bullet, sir?

38:22.833 --> 38:23.967
Yes, I do.

38:24.033 --> 38:25.367
Is that the one you signed, sir?

38:25.433 --> 38:26.500
Yes, it is.

38:26.567 --> 38:28.033
Has it been through
the barrel of a gun, sir?

38:28.100 --> 38:29.100
Absolutely.

38:29.167 --> 38:30.900
Step over to me, would you please, Dane?

38:30.967 --> 38:33.633
Chris, stand... Teller.
Some loose ends to tie up here.

38:33.700 --> 38:36.733
Turning off the laser sight,
opening the cylinder.

38:36.833 --> 38:38.533
One case in there,
reach in and pull that out yourself,

38:38.600 --> 38:39.600
would you please?

38:40.733 --> 38:42.533
Give that a whiff there, Dane.

38:42.600 --> 38:44.167
-Has that been fired there, Dane?
-Yes.

38:44.233 --> 38:45.533
What's on the side of it there, Dane?

38:45.600 --> 38:46.767
Lightning bolt.

38:46.833 --> 38:48.633
-Who drew that lightning bolt, Dane?
-I did.

38:48.700 --> 38:50.200
Reach into there, would you please,
Chris?

38:51.833 --> 38:53.333
Give that a whiff, Chris.

38:53.400 --> 38:55.267
Ah, it's a great smell, isn't it, Chris?

38:55.333 --> 38:56.667
Yes, sir, it is.

38:56.733 --> 38:57.867
PENN: What's on the side of it there,
Chris?

38:57.967 --> 38:58.967
It's the flower I drew.

38:59.033 --> 39:01.133
Flower you drew? Stand right there,
would you please, gentlemen?

39:01.200 --> 39:04.500
Couple more
things you might be interested in.

39:04.567 --> 39:07.167
Now, Dane, without hurting yourself,

39:07.233 --> 39:12.500
would you prove to yourself that that
bullet hole goes all the way through

39:13.700 --> 39:15.400
that piece of glass?

39:15.467 --> 39:16.633
See it went all the way through there,
Dane?

39:16.700 --> 39:17.867
-Yes.
-All the way through?

39:17.933 --> 39:18.933
All the way.

39:20.033 --> 39:21.467
See it went all the way through there,
Chris?

39:21.533 --> 39:22.567
Oh. Yes.

39:22.633 --> 39:23.633
(AUDIENCE GASPING)

39:23.700 --> 39:25.533
The whole whirlwind is now a bullet hole.

39:25.600 --> 39:27.333
-(LAUGHING)
-Chris, Dane,

39:27.400 --> 39:28.500
you may keep the bullet.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.100
You may keep the shell.

39:30.167 --> 39:31.967
Good luck getting those on the airplane.

39:32.433 --> 39:33.800
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

39:33.867 --> 39:34.867
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

39:34.933 --> 39:36.033
That's Dane.

39:36.100 --> 39:37.233
That's Chris.

39:39.700 --> 39:42.700
Wow. Now, that is what I call
a big finish.

39:42.767 --> 39:44.833
Penn and Teller, ladies and gentlemen.

39:44.900 --> 39:47.067
That is all the magic
we could fit into one hour,

39:47.133 --> 39:49.133
but join us next week
when we do it all again.

39:49.200 --> 39:52.167
Good night from Las Vegas,
where the party's just getting started.

39:52.233 --> 39:53.800
Good night, everybody.

39:53.867 --> 39:55.800
