<i>"What I Like About You.."</i>

00:04.003 --> 00:05.088
What am I gonna do?

00:05.171 --> 00:06.214
Val has been
planning this wedding

00:06.297 --> 00:07.590
since she was ten!

00:07.674 --> 00:09.759
She has pictured the dress,
she's pictured the roses.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.762
She picture her <i> fiance</i>
with another woman?

00:12.846 --> 00:14.889
Oh, my God!

00:14.973 --> 00:17.475
- He's with Julie!
- Julie?

00:17.559 --> 00:19.561
<i>Ex-fiance</i> Julie?

00:19.644 --> 00:21.229
That scum!

00:21.312 --> 00:22.772
I saw you and Julie today.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.441
And don't you think
about having me whacked

00:24.524 --> 00:27.318
because Gary, Vince
and Ben saw you, too.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.988
Okay, Holly, listen,
Julie called me and said

00:30.071 --> 00:31.614
she wanted
to give me her blessing.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.117
She said that it would,
it would help her have closure.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.368
Okay, if it's all so innocent

00:35.452 --> 00:36.703
then why didn't you
just tell Val?

00:36.786 --> 00:39.998
Holly, there's nothing
to worry about, okay?

00:41.291 --> 00:43.001
What you said about Julie
makes sense

00:43.084 --> 00:45.503
but if you ever hurt my sister..

00:47.464 --> 00:49.591
...it'll be
a lot harder than that.

(Lauren)
'Let's get that grub
on the table!'

00:56.014 --> 00:58.475
I have to eat at three o'clock,
that is when my diet starts.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.268
Lauren, who starts a diet
on Thanksgiving?

01:00.351 --> 01:03.062
A person whose bridesmaid's
dress has shrunk.

01:03.146 --> 01:05.648
- Oh..
- On the hanger?

01:05.732 --> 01:08.485
You are a mean little girl.

01:08.568 --> 01:09.903
Val's wedding is tomorrow.

01:09.986 --> 01:11.237
How are you gonna
lose weight by then?

01:11.321 --> 01:13.323
Oh, it's the one-hour diet,
mm-hmm.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.200
Eat anything you want
for one hour

01:15.283 --> 01:16.826
nothing before and nothing after

01:16.910 --> 01:17.994
and the literature promises

01:18.077 --> 01:20.246
you'll lose three pounds
by the next day.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.083
[chuckles]
On the hanger?

01:24.167 --> 01:26.461
[laughs]

01:26.544 --> 01:29.506
You've never been fat, have you?

01:29.589 --> 01:31.966
Now, I'm gonna throw some
marshmallows on these yams

01:32.050 --> 01:34.177
and watch my ass melt away!

01:35.178 --> 01:36.638
Okay, honey, come here.

01:36.721 --> 01:38.515
It's time to carve.

01:38.598 --> 01:39.557
Ooh, just think

01:39.641 --> 01:41.184
next year we'll be
carving a turkey

01:41.267 --> 01:42.393
in our country house

01:42.477 --> 01:43.978
the year after that,
you'll be carving

01:44.062 --> 01:45.522
while I'm breast-feeding
the baby.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.065
- The year after that--
- Yeah, yeah, uh, see.

01:47.148 --> 01:48.691
That's the difference
between you and me.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.819
I don't even know
what we're having for <i> dessert</i>

01:50.902 --> 01:53.029
but you know who's gonna be
snacking on your rack

01:53.112 --> 01:54.531
two years from now.

01:56.449 --> 01:57.659
Well, Val seems totally cool

01:57.742 --> 01:59.202
with Rick seeing Julie
the other day.

01:59.285 --> 02:01.663
Oh, yeah, well, there's, um,
good reason for that.

02:01.746 --> 02:04.666
I didn't tell her.
And nobody's going to, okay?

02:04.749 --> 02:06.668
Gary?

02:06.751 --> 02:09.044
Gary? Well, why am I
always the one that--

02:09.127 --> 02:12.215
Who blows it?
Because you've got a huge mouth.

02:12.298 --> 02:15.134
Well, I-I can't help it,
I mean, I try to keep secrets

02:15.218 --> 02:17.345
but my brain fills up
with so many other things

02:17.428 --> 02:19.931
that secrets pop out of my mouth
like a gumball.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.059
Well, it does.

02:24.352 --> 02:25.728
I thought
you decided to tell Val.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.897
I did, but then I thought

02:27.981 --> 02:30.108
"Okay, so what?
Julie called Rick."

02:30.191 --> 02:31.317
She needed a little closure.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.570
And if I was marrying Ben,
and you called

02:33.653 --> 02:35.613
and wanted to get together,
it would be nothing

02:35.697 --> 02:38.116
because we don't have feelings
for each other anymore.

02:38.199 --> 02:39.242
Exactly.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.870
It's not like
Julie called Rick crying

02:41.953 --> 02:44.914
"I still love you,
I can't go on without you.

We have to wait for him.

Yeah, sweetie,
he's 20 minutes late.

I wish they'd move this thing
along, I've got a date later on.

- With who?
- Oh, I can't say.

03:54.108 --> 03:57.028
I don't want anyone to know.
My boss.

03:57.111 --> 03:58.863
- Your married boss?
- Okay, shh.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.616
Do you understand what "I don't
want anyone to know" means?

04:01.699 --> 04:03.743
I wrote him a love letter
and he left me a message saying

04:03.826 --> 04:05.745
he wants me to meet him
at the office at 5:00.

04:05.828 --> 04:07.413
He's gonna
ditch his wife today?

04:07.497 --> 04:10.583
Mm-hmm. I finally understand
the meaning of thanksgiving.

- Hi, everyone, sorry I'm--
- Where's the pie?

04:14.504 --> 04:16.923
I don't see pie!

04:17.005 --> 04:18.216
Oh, bugger, I'm sorry.

04:18.298 --> 04:19.676
I-I got this
really important phone call.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.427
I got so excited,
I just totally forgot.

04:21.511 --> 04:22.637
Yeah, okay,
I knew I couldn't trust

04:22.720 --> 04:25.306
a skinny English guy.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.849
It's a good thing
I brought backup.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.560
So happy holidays to all.
I'm going in.

04:29.644 --> 04:32.313
I will see you in one hour.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.370
Don't mind her. She's dieting.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.664
So, um, what was your big,
important phone call?

04:49.747 --> 04:51.374
Oh, uh, do you remember
that audition you got me

04:51.457 --> 04:53.293
to play guitar
on the Jack Johnson tour?

04:53.376 --> 04:55.503
You mean,
the one you didn't get?

04:57.130 --> 05:01.009
What? I take an interest
in his career.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.927
Yeah, well, the bloke who got it
has hemorrhoids

05:03.011 --> 05:05.138
and he can't sit on
the tour bus for long hours.

05:06.472 --> 05:07.682
Mm-mm..

05:07.765 --> 05:09.851
Mm..

05:09.934 --> 05:12.478
Wow, when she goes on a diet,
she really sticks to it.

05:15.356 --> 05:17.608
Okay, so? What does this mean?

05:17.692 --> 05:20.820
It means I'm playing guitar
on the Jack Johnson tour

05:20.903 --> 05:22.655
and I leave tomorrow night
after the wedding

05:22.739 --> 05:23.781

for two months?

05:37.378 --> 05:38.671
Not necessarily.

I could bring my manager with me

my girlfriend.

the tour starts in Newark.

If anything,
you'll need a tetanus shot.

you're leaving for two months?

05:58.649 --> 06:00.985
Oh, yeah, but don't be all sad.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.779
I'll call you every night.

- The night before your wedding.
- I know.

06:30.014 --> 06:31.307
I have to talk to you
about something.

06:31.390 --> 06:33.976
Oh, God,
I knew this day would come.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.561
Okay, Val, honey

06:35.645 --> 06:37.355
when a man and a woman

06:37.438 --> 06:39.816
love each other very much--

06:39.899 --> 06:42.401
No, not that.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.695
I, I found out something
about Rick

06:44.779 --> 06:46.155
that I really wish I hadn't.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.365
Oh, my God!

06:47.448 --> 06:49.951
- He told you about Julie?
- Julie?

06:50.034 --> 06:51.661
- What?
- What are you talking about?

06:51.744 --> 06:53.246
What are you talking about?

06:53.329 --> 06:55.498
Well, well, I found out
that Rick got Gavin DeGraw

06:55.581 --> 06:57.500
to sing at our wedding,
and I ruined the surprise.

06:57.583 --> 07:01.379
You know how I love surprises.
Why did you just say Julie?

07:01.462 --> 07:02.880
Andrews!

07:02.964 --> 07:04.715
Julie Andrews!

07:04.799 --> 07:06.300
I thought
that it would be very nice

07:06.384 --> 07:08.302
if you and I watched
"The Sound Of Music" together

07:08.386 --> 07:09.595
because you're
getting married tomorrow

07:09.679 --> 07:12.014
and in our own way, we're saying

07:12.098 --> 07:13.099
so long, farewell

07:13.182 --> 07:16.477
<i>auf Wiedersehen,</i> goodnight.

07:16.561 --> 07:19.689
Holly, why did you
just say Julie?

07:19.772 --> 07:22.650
Okay, before I tell you,
I just want you to know

07:22.733 --> 07:24.694
that Rick said it meant nothing.

07:24.777 --> 07:27.029
- What meant nothing?
- Okay.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.575
Do you remember the other day
how Rick said

07:30.658 --> 07:32.785
he was in New Jersey
on business?

07:32.869 --> 07:34.203
- Mm-hmm.
- Well.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.538
He was actually

07:35.621 --> 07:38.749
having <i> pizza</i> with Julie
in Queens.

07:38.833 --> 07:39.959
- Go on.
- Okay, well.

07:40.042 --> 07:41.335
Rick said that she called him

07:41.419 --> 07:43.045
and just said
that she needed some closure

07:43.129 --> 07:44.338
and the reason
he didn't tell you

07:44.422 --> 07:47.466
is he didn't want you
to get upset.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.093
If you wanna break something

07:49.177 --> 07:51.888
I, I haven't
washed this one yet.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.264
No, no, I won't break anything.

07:53.347 --> 07:54.932
Well, she called him.
She needed closure.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.059
I-if Rick said it meant nothing,
then I'm sure it meant nothing.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.562
Yeah, people need closure.
She needed closure with Rick.

07:59.645 --> 08:00.813
It's actually very sweet of him

08:00.897 --> 08:02.315
actually, you know,
'cause he's very caring

08:02.398 --> 08:03.983
and that's just one of
the reasons I love him so much.

08:04.066 --> 08:06.986
Okay, Val, you're, uh,
talking pretty fast.

08:07.069 --> 08:09.614
- Look, you're obviously upset.
- No! No, I'm not upset.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.616
I'm just flying high 'cause it's
my freakin' wedding tomorrow!

08:11.699 --> 08:14.869

Okay, Holly, calm down.

08:14.952 --> 08:17.997
Alright, um, I'm just gonna
go upstairs and go to bed

08:18.080 --> 08:20.291
and you should, uh,
get some sleep, too

08:20.374 --> 08:22.919
you know, 'cause we have
a big day tomorrow!

08:23.002 --> 08:24.879
- It's 6:30.
- Not in France, Holly.

Not in France!

I am out of here.

08:46.609 --> 08:49.820
Why are you staring
at Ben's boxers?

08:49.904 --> 08:53.115
Because I was about
to do this to them.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.660
Two months!

08:55.743 --> 08:58.162
Two months she's gonna be
on the road with him.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.664
Do you know what that means?

08:59.747 --> 09:03.167
It means she's finally gonna
see these on him

09:03.251 --> 09:06.212
or worse, off him!

09:06.295 --> 09:07.713
Dude, trust me.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.590
This is the best thing
that could ever happen to you.

09:09.674 --> 09:12.301
Two months away from Holly,
and you can finally move on.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.888
What if I can't, Gary?
What if I can't?

09:16.722 --> 09:18.891
Give me those!

09:18.975 --> 09:21.936
I can't talk to you while you're
fondling another man's drawers.

09:23.896 --> 09:27.066
It's just that at least when
she was here, I had a chance.

09:29.443 --> 09:30.486
What am I saying?

09:30.569 --> 09:32.655
She doesn't even know I'm alive.

09:33.656 --> 09:36.409
Oh, brah, look at you

09:36.492 --> 09:38.119
being all vulnerable.

Hi, Tina, come on in.

10:20.536 --> 10:21.746
Can you believe this?

10:21.829 --> 10:23.497
The reason
the vet wanted to meet me

10:23.581 --> 10:25.916
was to tell me
that he's in love with his wife.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.169
Who's in love with their wife?

10:29.628 --> 10:30.880
I'm sorry, Tina.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.506
I'm such an idiot.

You and me, both.

10:34.967 --> 10:38.262
How can I be so stupid, Vince?

10:38.346 --> 10:40.514
It's easy to be stupid
when you're in love with someone

I have seen you

Val found out
about Rick and Julie.

- How?
- Not important.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.334
Okay, it was me! I screwed up.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.002
I opened up my stupid mouth

13:57.086 --> 13:58.712
and told Val
about Rick and Julie.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.089
Well, did you tell her
that it was no big deal

14:00.172 --> 14:01.966
that Julie only called Rick
for closure?

14:02.049 --> 14:03.300
Yeah, but it was too late.

I mean, you should've seen
her face. It killed her.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.183

that something didn't happen

14:14.895 --> 14:16.730
Oh-oh, you can do it.

14:18.190 --> 14:21.652
She is in such denial.
What is that doth protest thing?

14:21.735 --> 14:24.905
Uh, "The lady doth protest too
much." It's from Hamlet.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.532
It means, when somebody has sex

14:26.615 --> 14:29.994
with somebody they shouldn't
have, it was a huge mistake.

14:32.496 --> 14:34.623

that I ruined the happiest night

of my sister's life.

I-I think you should do

14:42.881 --> 14:44.091
is, uh, uh, forget about it.

They're getting married
tomorrow.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.219

14:47.303 --> 14:49.722
Hm. That's from "Scooby-Doo."

accidentally have sex

14:57.896 --> 14:59.648
How can I forget about it?

14:59.732 --> 15:01.984
I mean,
I made my sister have doubts.

15:02.067 --> 15:04.028
And I have to figure out
a way to un-doubt her.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.655
I'm not gonna let her walk down
the aisle with this in her head.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.825
But Rick already told you
there's nothing to worry about.

15:09.908 --> 15:12.494
I know, and that's what I told
Val, but it wasn't enough.

15:12.578 --> 15:16.165
I mean, there's only one other
person who can reassure her.

15:16.248 --> 15:19.918
That's it. I'm going to Julie,
right to the source.

15:20.002 --> 15:22.588
