00:01.960 --> 00:03.520
Go now! Go!

00:05.560 --> 00:11.080
(theme music playing)

01:09.000 --> 01:14.600
(upbeat music playing)

01:15.680 --> 01:17.440
-(Angela) Oh, my God.
-(Jordan) What are you doing?

01:18.320 --> 01:21.560
-(Angela) I'm sorry.
-(Jordan) Slow down. Slow down!

01:21.640 --> 01:23.800
-(Jordan) Hey!
-(Angela) Help me. What am I doing?

01:23.880 --> 01:26.680
-(Jordan) What do you think you're doing?
-(Angela) I don't know.

01:26.760 --> 01:29.040
-(Jordan) Stop the car.
-(Angela) Help me.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.240
(Jordan) Just stop the car.

01:30.920 --> 01:31.960
St... Stop!

01:32.680 --> 01:34.160
(Angela) Oops.

01:35.680 --> 01:38.080
You shouldn't have let me.
I told you I couldn't drive.

01:38.160 --> 01:40.120
This is only, like, my second time...

01:44.240 --> 01:45.720
behind the wheel.

01:49.640 --> 01:52.280
I'm really sorry.
I couldn't find the brake.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.160
How long are we supposed
to keep doing this?

01:57.560 --> 01:58.560
I don't know.

02:00.160 --> 02:02.000
I mean... What do you mean?

02:02.080 --> 02:03.520
You know what I mean.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.600
Well, yeah, I...

02:08.200 --> 02:10.000
but what do you want me to do?

02:10.920 --> 02:13.200
I mean, I know
what you want me to do, but...

02:16.640 --> 02:18.480
Do you ever get obsessed
with the rearview mirror,

02:18.560 --> 02:21.240
like... while you're driving?

02:22.080 --> 02:23.080
Look.

02:24.720 --> 02:27.480
-Can't we just...
-Just what? Just...

02:28.880 --> 02:29.880
Do it?

02:30.640 --> 02:34.480
-Right here in a parking lot?
-We're not in a parking lot.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.480
We're in a car.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.120
Why, where do you want to do it?

02:41.680 --> 02:43.040
Oh, I don't know.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.760
How about in my room tonight
after my parents fall asleep?

02:45.840 --> 02:47.800
We'll have to be really quiet.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.400
What, you actually, like,
expect me to choose a place?

02:53.440 --> 02:54.720
Well, yeah.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.760
I better go to Geometry.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.560
(car door opens)

03:13.240 --> 03:14.240
(slams car door)

03:14.320 --> 03:16.440
(Rickie)
Look at that Cynthia Hargrove.

03:16.520 --> 03:18.880
It's a pierced nose,
it's not an actual personality.

03:18.960 --> 03:20.200
You are something.

03:20.280 --> 03:24.160
-Who were you trashing?
-Cynthia Hargrove's nose stud.

03:24.840 --> 03:26.880
It's too small.
It's like a semiprecious pimple.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.600
She's such a sleaze.
You're, like, an improvement.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.040
-Totally.
-What do you mean?

03:33.080 --> 03:35.040
You mean Jordan went out
with Cynthia Hargrove?

03:35.120 --> 03:37.280
Well, "went out"...

03:37.360 --> 03:41.400
I mean, I don't know how many
outside locations they actually went to.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.160
But she's somebody
Jordan used to... Um...

03:45.240 --> 03:47.680
-Yes. Jordan used to "um" her.
-You knew that.

03:47.760 --> 03:51.560
-You must have known that I knew that.
-I must have blanked out.

03:51.640 --> 03:52.720
It's okay. It's no big deal.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.520
I just didn't know about...
Cynthia Hargrove.

03:56.240 --> 03:58.320
So... now I know.

03:59.560 --> 04:01.560
They obviously haven't "ummed" yet.

04:04.480 --> 04:06.240
(Angela) <i>I couldn't stop thinking</i>
<i>about it...</i>

04:06.320 --> 04:08.080
<i>the, like, fact of it.</i>

04:08.160 --> 04:13.280
<i>That people had sex,</i>
<i>that they just had it,</i>

04:13.360 --> 04:17.920
<i>that sex was this thing</i>
<i>people had like a rash</i>

04:18.000 --> 04:20.840
<i>or a... a Rottweiler.</i>

04:20.920 --> 04:24.760
<i>Everything started to seem,</i>
<i>like, pornographic or something.</i>

04:25.360 --> 04:29.000
<i>It's like Ms. Krzyzanowski has sex.</i>

04:29.080 --> 04:30.680
<i>So does Mr. Katimski.</i>

04:30.760 --> 04:32.080
<i>They both have sex.</i>

04:32.160 --> 04:35.840
<i>They could have sex together,</i>
<i>like, right now.</i>

04:36.640 --> 04:38.400
<i>I am, like, the sickest person.</i>

04:40.120 --> 04:42.240
Anyway, so, yeah,
we're looking forward to it.

04:42.320 --> 04:43.800
-Ah-choo!
-So...

04:43.880 --> 04:46.520
Mom, if you had a flu shot,
then how come you're sick?

04:48.160 --> 04:51.240
-Okay, We'll see you Friday.
-I'm not sick.

04:51.320 --> 04:54.680
Sometimes the flu shot
makes you a little sick.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.040
That was Hallie Lowenthal.

04:56.120 --> 04:58.480
-They accept.
-Great.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.000
Who's Hallie Lowenthal?

05:00.080 --> 05:01.840
Someone in Daddy's cooking class

05:01.920 --> 05:04.800
who we invited to dinner
with her fiancée.

05:04.880 --> 05:06.560
What's her fiancée's name again?

05:06.640 --> 05:10.040
-Uh, Brad.
-That's such a perfect fiancée name.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.120
Isn't it?

05:11.200 --> 05:12.640
(door closes)

05:12.720 --> 05:15.800
-Angela?
-(Angela) Mom, I'm not hungry.

05:15.880 --> 05:19.960
Dad, mom says I have to have a flu shot.
Do I have to have a flu shot?

05:20.040 --> 05:22.560
You know, I know exactly
what's going to happen.

05:22.640 --> 05:23.640
It's gonna be 10:00 at night,

05:23.720 --> 05:27.000
she'll be poking
around that kitchen like Princess Di

05:27.080 --> 05:28.720
asking you to make her something.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.360
(Angela)
I heard that. I won't be hungry later.

05:31.440 --> 05:34.560
Well, good, because we're not
running a restaurant.

05:34.640 --> 05:38.520
Lisa Yamamoto had a flu shot.
It was, like, 3 inches long.

05:40.040 --> 05:44.120
You know, we said we wanted
to meet this Jordan, if they're going out.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.640
-Are they going out?
-They're not going out.

05:46.720 --> 05:48.000
I would know if they're going out.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.640
Doesn't he drives her home sometimes?

05:49.720 --> 05:52.400
We don't even know
what kind of driver he is...

05:53.040 --> 05:53.880
not to mention...

05:55.000 --> 05:56.560
Not to mention...

05:57.320 --> 06:02.280
-What else we can't mention.
-Exactly. I mean, he has a car.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.080
A car has doors and seats.

06:04.160 --> 06:05.040
Oh, God.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.680
They may as well have their own apartment.

06:07.760 --> 06:10.360
-So do I have to?
-We have to meet him.

06:10.440 --> 06:13.400
-We have to be firm and consistent.
-Get a flu shot?

06:13.480 --> 06:14.520
-No.
-Yes.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.280
Yes, he affirmed firmly.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.720
Um, when you said
what else they could be doing,

06:24.800 --> 06:25.840
did you mean, like, foreplay?

06:29.640 --> 06:30.800
(coughs)

06:33.840 --> 06:38.440
(mellow music playing)

06:38.520 --> 06:39.840
(knock on door)

06:42.920 --> 06:47.440
(intense music playing)

06:58.960 --> 07:00.440
Who's there?

07:06.800 --> 07:11.960
(upbeat music playing)

07:17.080 --> 07:18.080
Hey.

07:18.680 --> 07:19.680
Hi.

07:21.480 --> 07:23.960
(Angela) <i>It's a dream.</i>
<i>I'm having a dream.</i>

07:24.040 --> 07:25.080
(door closes)

07:25.560 --> 07:28.800
<i>I've had this dream,</i>
<i>only without the cold cuts.</i>

07:28.880 --> 07:30.480
Wow. Food.

07:31.600 --> 07:35.400
What are you doing here?
It's late. It's really...

07:36.520 --> 07:40.160
-My parents are right upstairs.
-They are?

07:40.240 --> 07:42.720
Well, they live here.

07:43.280 --> 07:46.400
You said you wanted to do it in your room
while your parents were sleeping.

07:47.720 --> 07:48.920
I was joking.

07:51.840 --> 07:53.280
Seriously. You have to go.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.640
Okay.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.880
-You know that empty house on Cloverdale?
-Shh. Wait a second.

08:11.360 --> 08:14.160
The one that's been for sale,
like, forever.

08:14.880 --> 08:18.440
Tino found a way to get in
through this window in the back.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.120
So people have been going there...

08:22.000 --> 08:24.920
you know, to have a place...

08:25.640 --> 08:26.680
to go.

08:28.440 --> 08:29.440
So, you want to?

08:31.600 --> 08:32.720
Friday night?

08:33.760 --> 08:35.280
Like, breaking and entering?

08:36.600 --> 08:40.000
Just... entering.

08:41.840 --> 08:42.960
So we can...

08:43.520 --> 08:45.000
you know...

08:46.440 --> 08:47.800
be somewhere.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.400
-Angela.
-Mom?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.240
Didn't I predict this?

09:00.880 --> 09:03.840
Didn't I predict that this would happen?

09:03.920 --> 09:07.320
-Didn't I tell you you'd be hungry?
-Oh, yeah. Right.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.240
Mom, listen...

09:09.320 --> 09:11.720
Now, look. I...
I'm not trying to interfere,

09:11.800 --> 09:14.640
but it's just that I think it's important

09:14.720 --> 09:17.760
that we all eat dinner together
as a family.

09:17.840 --> 09:21.160
Oh, no. Me, too.
I agree, absolutely, as a family.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.760
Okay. Well, finish up...

09:24.840 --> 09:29.080
whatever it is you're nibbling on in there
and don't leave a mess for me to clean up.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.440
Oh! And don't forget
what we talked about tonight,

09:31.520 --> 09:33.720
about daddy and me
meeting your friend Jordan.

09:33.800 --> 09:34.960
Uh...

09:36.600 --> 09:38.240
-I... I won't.
-But...

09:38.320 --> 09:40.480
Sweetheart, there's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

09:40.560 --> 09:43.120
You like this Jordan.
I've no problem with that.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.000
-We just want to meet him.
-Okay.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.520
(footsteps receding)

09:52.600 --> 09:53.720
(Angela sighs)

09:56.800 --> 09:58.200
(door closes)

09:59.720 --> 10:02.520
-So you like me?
-Oh, shut up.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.560
-I mean, your mother says you like me.
-Oh, shut up.

10:07.880 --> 10:10.400
So... Friday night?

10:11.760 --> 10:14.320
Oh, yeah. Right. The house.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.000
There are, like, eight bedrooms.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.320
That many.

10:18.400 --> 10:23.360
(mellow music playing)

10:43.600 --> 10:48.280
(upbeat music playing)

10:49.880 --> 10:50.880
Sharon.

10:51.480 --> 10:52.640
-Hi.
-Hi.

10:53.440 --> 10:57.320
Oh, I'm returning
your mom's chafing dish,

10:57.400 --> 11:00.600
and you're supposed
to tell her "thanks" from my mom.

11:00.680 --> 11:03.960
Okay. She's about to pick me up
any minute to take me and get a flu shot.

11:04.040 --> 11:05.440
Oh, I hate shots.

11:06.560 --> 11:07.560
-Well...
-So...

11:08.280 --> 11:09.720
you and Kyle broke up?

11:11.320 --> 11:14.520
I mean, was there, like... a reason?

11:15.560 --> 11:19.600
I guess I'd have to say...
it was my beliefs.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.800
I didn't feel like I should...

11:23.040 --> 11:26.160
give up my beliefs, even for Kyle.

11:26.240 --> 11:28.640
(Angela) <i>So Sharon had beliefs.</i>

11:28.720 --> 11:31.000
<i>Sharon had decided to stay a virgin.</i>

11:31.640 --> 11:36.440
So how did you, like... I mean,
you just... told him

11:36.520 --> 11:38.360
that you didn't want to, you know,

11:38.440 --> 11:41.800
like, have... have, um, have sex with him

11:41.880 --> 11:44.240
no matter how much
he was, like, expecting it?

11:44.320 --> 11:46.560
Oh, no. No, no. We... We had sex.

11:46.640 --> 11:50.240
I'm saying, I had a belief
he was being a butthead which was true.

11:51.280 --> 11:53.400
You had, like, intercourse?

11:54.480 --> 11:55.840
Like, constantly.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.440
Okay. Come on. Angela's next.

11:58.520 --> 12:00.200
I was, like, "So get it over with,"

12:00.280 --> 12:02.560
and Dr. Skolnick was, like,
"I already did."

12:03.040 --> 12:05.720
-See you outside.
-It doesn't even hurt that much.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.080
Well, don't say hello or anything.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.920
-Oh, hi, Dr. Skolnick.
-Hello, Angela.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.120
Something is very wrong.

12:16.640 --> 12:19.760
You seem to have become 15 years old.
(laughs)

12:21.160 --> 12:23.720
Dr. Skolnick, if I had a question...

12:24.720 --> 12:26.280
about, um...

12:27.600 --> 12:29.120
a medical question...

12:30.240 --> 12:34.240
-for a research project at school.
-Oh, sure. What's the question?

12:34.880 --> 12:37.240
Well, it's a question about...

12:38.920 --> 12:40.360
percentages,

12:41.280 --> 12:42.320
of what's normal,

12:43.680 --> 12:47.000
you know, in terms of...
what people actually do.

12:47.920 --> 12:49.920
I mean, people my age.

12:51.080 --> 12:52.560
I just need to see some...

12:54.320 --> 12:57.080
-statistics.
-Sorry.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.000
Angela, look...

13:00.840 --> 13:02.680
I think I know what you're trying to ask,

13:02.760 --> 13:05.720
and as somebody who's known you
for several years...

13:06.480 --> 13:09.640
if you need to talk about anything,
I'm always here.

13:09.720 --> 13:14.080
But, as your doctor, I have to say...
as the risk of being intrusive...

13:14.640 --> 13:16.280
I urge you, please...

13:17.360 --> 13:19.280
use a condom and a sponge.

13:22.920 --> 13:24.920
(telephone ringing)

13:26.280 --> 13:28.600
No. I definitely said this Friday.

13:29.560 --> 13:32.560
No. Patty, the point is they're here.
They're in our living room.

13:33.240 --> 13:36.640
Well, I can hold dinner
for a little while, but...

13:37.680 --> 13:39.840
Okay, okay. All right, all right.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.440
Don't work too hard. I'll see you at 8.

13:42.960 --> 13:48.280
(upbeat music playing)

13:49.200 --> 13:50.920
(Hallie)
Well, somebody has to turn up the heat.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.920
Hey! Hey! Careful.
You'll burn the house down.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.360
Why simmer when you can boil?

13:55.440 --> 13:56.480
She's a terrible cook,

13:56.560 --> 13:58.400
but you must already know that
as her cooking teacher.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.640
I mean, that's why she needs you.

13:59.720 --> 14:01.040
That's not why I need him.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.320
I need 'cause he's going to make us
all rich.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.680
-Where's the bathroom?
-Uh...

14:05.760 --> 14:08.200
-It's just it's out there to your right.
-Thank you.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.320
What do you mean, I'll make us all...
What she mean?

14:11.400 --> 14:13.400
(Hallie) Don't tell him, Brad.
I want to tell him.

14:13.480 --> 14:16.440
-It's this thing we've been talking about.
-(Hallie) Shut up, Brad.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.360
She wants to open a restaurant
in the near future

14:18.440 --> 14:20.000
and she wants you to cook for it.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.640
What? Are you serious?

14:22.720 --> 14:25.040
-She wants to open a restaurant?
-Why did you tell him? Ooh!

14:25.120 --> 14:26.360
I want to tell him.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.080
So, what do you think?

14:28.960 --> 14:30.560
Say yes. Say something.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.240
-Well, I don't know what to say.
-Listen, listen.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.800
I may throw like a girl,
but I'm a financial wizard.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.960
Really! Seriously!
And with Bradley's connections...

14:39.040 --> 14:41.160
-See? He's loaded.
-She's marrying me for my money.

14:41.240 --> 14:42.880
Uh-huh. I thought you sold commercial...

14:42.960 --> 14:45.360
Commercial space. I do. I sell space.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.440
Think I want to sell space my whole life?

14:49.600 --> 14:51.520
We're not seriously discussing this?

14:51.600 --> 14:54.960
Okay. Okay. We're not. We're not.

14:56.560 --> 14:59.800
But if we were... Come on.
This is what I want to do.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.960
Put together a limited partnership,
minimize our personal risk.

15:02.040 --> 15:02.840
(doorbell rings)

15:02.920 --> 15:04.480
That's Patty. I guess she forgot her key.

15:11.840 --> 15:14.280
-Oh.
-"Oh" back at you.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.200
Is Angela here?

15:17.280 --> 15:18.640
Are you Jordan?

15:19.400 --> 15:20.840
Yeah.

15:22.920 --> 15:25.040
Are you... her dad?

15:27.280 --> 15:29.160
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

15:30.520 --> 15:31.720
Yeah.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.600
So, you guys are going to a party.

15:36.360 --> 15:37.720
Is that what Angela said?

15:38.720 --> 15:42.000
-You mean, you're not?
-No, we are.

15:42.080 --> 15:47.000
(serene music playing)

15:49.360 --> 15:51.480
So, do you have a major?

15:53.280 --> 15:54.640
I don't think so.

15:55.160 --> 15:58.160
Oh, you'd probably know, um...
if you did.

15:59.040 --> 16:00.040
Yeah.

16:00.120 --> 16:03.840
I probably would have gotten,
like... a letter or something.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.800
-(Angela) Dad.
-Yeah, that's my name.

16:13.280 --> 16:14.600
Dad.

16:20.760 --> 16:24.440
Well, I met him, your... friend.
He seems, you know...

16:25.520 --> 16:28.520
Well, what does meeting somebody
prove? Right?

16:28.600 --> 16:29.720
-Dad...
-You want to meet

16:29.800 --> 16:32.080
one of my cooking students
and her fiancée?

16:32.160 --> 16:33.840
Um, not really.

16:35.080 --> 16:37.960
-Dad, maybe I shouldn't go.
-Why?

16:38.040 --> 16:39.600
Because... Because mom's not home

16:39.680 --> 16:41.400
and she said you both
had to meet him before I...

16:41.480 --> 16:43.120
Oh, honey. No. That's okay.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.880
Your mom was supposed to be home by now,
but something came up at work.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.400
Really. It's okay.
This is not one of those times

16:48.480 --> 16:49.960
where your mother and I are not in sync.

16:50.040 --> 16:52.880
Oh, 'cause, I mean, I'll understand
if you don't want me to go.

16:52.960 --> 16:57.520
-Honey... really. It's okay.
-Oh.

17:00.600 --> 17:01.600
Great.

17:01.680 --> 17:04.640
(upbeat music playing)

17:04.720 --> 17:07.280
(indistinct chatter)

17:09.440 --> 17:13.400
Are you sure we won't go to jail
or something if the cops, like, burst in?

17:13.480 --> 17:15.240
Cops never really burst in.

17:16.360 --> 17:17.360
They don't?

17:17.440 --> 17:18.800
(indistinct chatter)

17:18.880 --> 17:21.760
(Jordan sighs)

17:21.840 --> 17:24.440
What if the neighbors,
like, report us or something?

17:24.520 --> 17:25.680
Then we'll leave.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.600
Is there any more beer?

17:29.320 --> 17:30.880
I think there's another one.

17:30.960 --> 17:35.440
(upbeat music playing)

17:42.080 --> 17:44.960
-Are we going up?
-Cynthia, that's so funny.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.440
-She doesn't know.
-Yeah.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.200
Angela.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.040
There's, like, no empty rooms
right now. So...

18:07.440 --> 18:08.960
So what do we do?

18:14.320 --> 18:15.920
See, I was wrong to...

18:17.040 --> 18:18.960
there's only, like, three bedrooms.

18:20.280 --> 18:21.280
Oh.

18:22.120 --> 18:26.480
Someone told me there were,
like, eight, but...

18:27.360 --> 18:28.440
they were wrong.

18:29.840 --> 18:31.000
Right.

18:31.720 --> 18:34.960
(Angela) <i>It was exactly like</i>
<i>when I was waiting to get my flu shot,</i>

18:35.040 --> 18:37.040
<i>only I didn't even get a magazine to read.</i>

18:39.240 --> 18:42.720
-I'll be right back.
-(train honking indistinctly)

18:44.560 --> 18:46.200
(Rayanne) Tino, I'm coming.

18:46.280 --> 18:49.720
-Rayanne.
-Wow! You're here?

18:49.800 --> 18:53.600
-Well, yeah. Rayanne...
-I got to go. Tino's waiting for me.

18:53.680 --> 18:55.360
-He's giving me a lift.
-No, wait. Rayanne...

18:55.440 --> 18:57.080
No. Seriously.
He'll leave without me.

18:57.160 --> 18:58.800
So you're with Jordan?

18:59.720 --> 19:02.240
That's so cool. I'll see you tomorrow.

19:02.320 --> 19:03.360
(car honking)

19:03.440 --> 19:06.080
-Keep your shirt on.
-There's an empty room now, so...

19:06.160 --> 19:07.600
Um...

19:08.360 --> 19:11.800
I... I'm kind of worried... about Rayanne.

19:11.880 --> 19:14.400
What about her?
I thought I just saw her leave.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.600
Exa... Exactly. I mean... I mean, um...

19:18.520 --> 19:19.640
See... See, I know her.

19:19.720 --> 19:22.600
I mean, I was there
when she almost OD'd, and...

19:25.360 --> 19:27.320
Just now,
she looked pretty out of it. I think...

19:27.920 --> 19:29.600
You... You know,
I think I should... I should...

19:30.520 --> 19:32.480
Sorry. I should... I should go.

19:32.560 --> 19:35.720
(upbeat music playing)

19:35.800 --> 19:36.920
So go.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.320
(tense music playing)

19:55.720 --> 19:58.800
(announcer) My So-Called Life
<i>will continue here on ABC.</i>

20:14.040 --> 20:14.960
(Bradley) Are you crazy?

20:15.040 --> 20:17.120
(Hallie) Come on, admit it.
It's a great idea.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.000
I didn't say
it wasn't a great idea. I said...

20:19.080 --> 20:20.800
-Hi!
-Hi! What's a great idea?

20:20.880 --> 20:21.800
Because my hand of God,

20:21.880 --> 20:23.480
Bradley here can flip
through his rolodex...

20:23.560 --> 20:25.200
I am so sorry.

20:25.280 --> 20:28.920
You must think that I'm the rudest person
on the face of the planet.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.920
Hardly. Since I actually hold the title.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.720
-Hi!
-Hi!

20:32.800 --> 20:35.800
I... I'm so...
I had no idea I'd be this late.

20:35.880 --> 20:36.880
Don't apologize.

20:36.960 --> 20:39.040
We ate every scrap of food
and left like 8 million dishes.

20:39.120 --> 20:40.360
She's kidding.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.320
No, in fact, there are dishes
in there we got greasy,

20:42.400 --> 20:43.640
just to mess with your head.

20:44.680 --> 20:46.840
Oh! Oh! Here, here. Catch up.

20:46.920 --> 20:48.360
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

20:50.280 --> 20:53.080
Mm. So, um, what's a great idea?

20:57.200 --> 20:58.360
I can't believe it.

20:58.440 --> 21:00.280
Can't believe
that Jordan Catalano was here,

21:00.360 --> 21:01.760
and I missed him.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.880
Oh, honey, we're talking gorgeous.

21:04.720 --> 21:07.600
I can't believe it. I missed everything.

21:08.800 --> 21:09.840
What is he like?

21:12.320 --> 21:14.040
Oh, you know.

21:14.120 --> 21:17.360
No, I don't know.
That's why I'm asking.

21:17.440 --> 21:21.200
Well, I don't know.
He's a... kid, you know?

21:21.840 --> 21:23.680
You're asking a man... sorry, sorry...

21:23.760 --> 21:26.240
to describe someone
when I'm sitting here?

21:26.800 --> 21:28.120
Here's what he's like.

21:28.200 --> 21:32.440
Fairly out of it... Not unintelligent...
sort of a stray puppy,

21:32.520 --> 21:34.400
the type you're always trying
to ease their pain.

21:34.480 --> 21:37.520
He may be a halfway decent person,
but let me tell you, trouble...

21:38.280 --> 21:39.320
way too gorgeous.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.000
Thank you.

21:44.320 --> 21:46.200
-(Patty) Bye!
-(Graham) Bye. Drive safe.

21:46.280 --> 21:47.760
(Patty) Be careful.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.720
-She's kind of loony, isn't she?
-Oh, she's fun.

21:52.320 --> 21:55.120
-That fiancée is such a Brad.
-Bigtime Brad.

21:56.360 --> 21:59.560
So, um, she's not serious
about this restaurant scheme, is she?

21:59.640 --> 22:02.440
Who knows?
I know I'm not getting involved with it.

22:02.520 --> 22:05.520
-She thinks you are.
-That's just the kind of person she is.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.840
I mean, do you know the failure rate
for new restaurants?

22:07.920 --> 22:10.520
It's the riskiest business there is.

22:10.600 --> 22:12.320
Patty, I just said I wasn't doing it.

22:13.560 --> 22:15.160
Of course,
some new restaurants must succeed.

22:15.240 --> 22:16.600
I mean, people have to eat somewhere.

22:16.680 --> 22:20.080
Graham, it would be gambling
with what passes for our savings.

22:20.160 --> 22:22.600
I mean, in three years,
Angela's going to go...

22:25.040 --> 22:28.080
Never mind.
I'm just going to drop this whole subject.

22:28.160 --> 22:31.360
Why? Without running it into the ground?
You?

22:31.440 --> 22:32.720
Very funny.

22:33.840 --> 22:36.560
-(bell rings)
-So, Angela went home sick, I heard.

22:36.640 --> 22:40.160
-A reaction to a flu shot or something?
-Fake. Faking.

22:40.840 --> 22:43.000
She can't face Jordan Catalano.

22:43.480 --> 22:44.880
What did he do to her?

22:44.960 --> 22:47.640
Nothing. He's mad
because she won't have sex with him.

22:47.720 --> 22:51.520
You know, it's so tragic to see her
making this whole big deal

22:51.600 --> 22:55.520
over this thing that's,
like, over in three seconds.

22:55.600 --> 22:58.560
Well, I like when they take
a really long time.

22:58.640 --> 23:00.240
Are you kidding?
You've never even done it.

23:00.320 --> 23:02.000
So? Neither have you.

23:02.600 --> 23:07.440
What I like... is when they run
this ice cube... up your body

23:07.520 --> 23:11.120
very, very slowly...

23:11.200 --> 23:14.320
until you think you'll lose your mind.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.840
Somebody seriously did that?
To you?

23:17.880 --> 23:19.280
Mickey Rourke did it.

23:20.040 --> 23:24.960
So you're saying that
she's, like, scared to have sex?

23:25.040 --> 23:27.840
Who knows?
All I know is she's hot for him.

23:27.920 --> 23:30.240
Mickey Rourke, does he,
like, go to this school?

23:34.360 --> 23:36.800

boring relationship stuff.

24:02.800 --> 24:05.720
Oh, okay. Here we go.

24:05.800 --> 24:07.440
Shelly and Mitch.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.600
They really love each other, but...

24:09.680 --> 24:12.400
lately their sex has become
routine and mechanical.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.960
Your parents actually watch this?

24:16.480 --> 24:18.640
Are you kidding me?
They've had it for, like, years.

24:19.360 --> 24:21.720
You can keep it for a while though.
They won't even notice.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.320
Why would I want to keep it?

24:26.080 --> 24:27.120
I don't know.

24:28.320 --> 24:29.920
Why were you asking me
all those questions?

24:33.080 --> 24:36.920
So... you and Jordan ever...

24:37.920 --> 24:39.680
(Angela)
<i>There's this dividing line</i>

24:39.760 --> 24:43.920

24:44.000 --> 24:46.200

24:46.280 --> 24:48.880

24:49.360 --> 24:50.600
Look...

24:51.920 --> 24:55.320
-you're allowed to ask me things.
-What things?

24:58.480 --> 25:01.800
-So did you use something?
-Angela, of course, we did.

25:01.880 --> 25:03.280
We used condoms. You have to!

25:03.360 --> 25:05.520
Promise me make him wear a condom
if you decided to do it!

25:05.600 --> 25:06.760
Okay!

25:07.800 --> 25:09.120
Let's stop talking about it.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.480
So, how did you, like...

25:14.880 --> 25:17.560
-decide? I mean...
-Look...

25:18.320 --> 25:23.440
I told Kyle I wanted to wait
until I was ready.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
And then...

25:26.000 --> 25:28.920
one night I... totally was.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.840
The only strange thing
is that after that...

25:34.560 --> 25:38.400
having sex was, like... expected.

25:39.120 --> 25:42.880
Because you can't, like... go back.

25:43.560 --> 25:45.920
I mean... it kind of...

25:46.600 --> 25:48.040

25:48.840 --> 25:51.720
if, like... I wanted to.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.720
Okay. Here's where they finally do it.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.480
So are you...

26:17.040 --> 26:18.720
different afterwards?

26:23.120 --> 26:26.240
This is going to sound stupid, but...

26:27.960 --> 26:29.280
afterward...

26:29.800 --> 26:32.120
I... I looked at myself in the mirror...

26:33.360 --> 26:34.360
just to...

26:35.360 --> 26:37.320
just to see if I looked different.

26:38.480 --> 26:39.800
Do you think I do?

26:43.960 --> 26:45.040
No.

26:45.680 --> 26:46.680
No! (laughs)

26:52.080 --> 26:56.640
You know...
you should talk to Jordan...

26:57.440 --> 26:58.440
because...

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
you have this tendency...

27:04.720 --> 27:06.240
to shut people out.

27:08.840 --> 27:09.840
I know.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.560
Did anyone see my tennis shoes?

27:15.840 --> 27:18.000
(Angela gasps, chuckles)

27:20.240 --> 27:23.000
Um, Dad, where's that thing

27:23.080 --> 27:27.320
that mom told me to give to Sharon
to give to Camille?

27:28.560 --> 27:31.080
Uh, maybe we should check
your room again.

27:31.160 --> 27:32.720
-Okay.
-Okay.

27:36.360 --> 27:41.960
(birds chirping)

27:43.600 --> 27:46.840
-Bye.
-Bye. I'll see you tomorrow.

27:46.920 --> 27:47.920
Yeah.

27:51.120 --> 27:52.120
Hi.

27:55.160 --> 27:56.560
Um...

27:56.640 --> 27:59.760
Danielle took my bike
'cause she hates hers. I just...

28:01.160 --> 28:02.160
I'm sorry.

28:03.880 --> 28:05.120
What?

28:05.680 --> 28:08.600
I'm sorry. I was going to ask
if I can borrow your bike but...

28:09.880 --> 28:12.240
Forget it. I'm always doing this.

28:12.320 --> 28:13.640
I'm always asking you for something,

28:13.720 --> 28:17.080
it's totally unfair, asking you for it.
It's like a sick habit.

28:17.160 --> 28:19.400
And just 'cause you're polite
doesn't mean it's right.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.000
It's not. It's wrong.

28:21.080 --> 28:24.440
Totally selfish of me,
and I'll never do it again, okay?

28:32.720 --> 28:33.960
I'll have it back by tonight.

28:37.280 --> 28:40.520
(seductive music playing)

28:40.600 --> 28:43.840
(woman)<i> Gunther and Liz learned</i>
<i>that no human desire</i>

28:43.920 --> 28:46.960
<i>is shameful or abnormal.</i>

28:52.960 --> 28:54.960
-Found it.
-Excuse me?

29:03.200 --> 29:04.640
Who's your favorite couple?

29:05.240 --> 29:07.120
Mine's Gunther and Liz.

29:09.160 --> 29:12.000
Excuse... I...
I've never seen this tape before.

29:12.080 --> 29:14.920
Now, now, now, don't be coy.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.680
I'm serious!
Why would I... get a tape like this?

29:19.760 --> 29:22.960
Uh, because our sex life
has become routine and mechanical.

29:23.840 --> 29:26.640
(woman)
<i>Soon, they began to trust each other</i>

29:26.720 --> 29:30.040
<i>enough to divulge</i>
<i>their most secret fantasies.</i>

29:30.120 --> 29:32.680
Do you really think that?
That our sex life is mechanical?

29:32.760 --> 29:34.720
Oh, Patty. Whoa!

29:36.160 --> 29:38.200
That really hurts my feelings.

29:38.280 --> 29:40.080
Why do you take me seriously
when I'm not serious?

29:40.160 --> 29:42.680
How do I know what you're
serious about these days?

29:42.760 --> 29:44.000
What does that mean?

29:44.080 --> 29:45.640
One minute,
you don't want to take the class.

29:45.720 --> 29:47.040
Next minute, you're teaching it.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.800
Next thing,
you want to open a restaurant.

29:48.880 --> 29:50.000
Don't want to open a restaurant.

29:50.080 --> 29:54.280
Then why the pointed comment
about many restaurants that do succeed?

29:54.360 --> 29:56.160
Because it's a fact. Some of them do.

29:57.440 --> 29:58.720
What?

29:58.800 --> 30:01.880
Oh, you don't believe
that a restaurant that I cook for...

30:01.960 --> 30:03.520
-...could succeed.
-How can you say that?

30:03.600 --> 30:05.840
-That's really the problem, isn't it?
-That's not true.

30:05.920 --> 30:09.680
(woman)<i> Having shared the most sacred love</i>
<i>a human being can know,</i>

30:09.760 --> 30:12.800

30:24.760 --> 30:28.160
(dog barking indistinctly)

30:28.240 --> 30:29.320
Hi.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.080
I'm sorry about Friday night.
I just had this flu shot.

30:36.160 --> 30:37.240
-I mean...
-Quit lying.

30:40.280 --> 30:41.760
Tino told me.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.480
Rayanne Graff has been clean
for, like, weeks...

30:45.320 --> 30:46.960
since the night she almost OD'd.

30:48.160 --> 30:49.160
Right?

30:51.520 --> 30:52.520
Yes.

30:58.400 --> 31:01.880
I mean... you can think
what you want about me.

31:02.680 --> 31:03.760
I never lied.

31:05.760 --> 31:06.800
I can't believe it.

31:07.400 --> 31:08.880
I let you drive my car.

31:12.360 --> 31:15.040
It's so hard to explain because...

31:17.880 --> 31:19.800
it's not going to sound right because...

31:23.640 --> 31:25.560
part of me really wants to.

31:25.640 --> 31:27.920
This is the whole reason
I didn't want to start this.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.600
Why, 'cause you knew you wouldn't get sex?

31:31.480 --> 31:34.520
-You'd just be wasting your time?
-Because you don't get it. Okay?

31:35.760 --> 31:37.360
You're supposed to!

31:37.440 --> 31:40.160
It's accepted!
It's what you're supposed to do...

31:41.040 --> 31:44.160
unless you're like, abnormal.

31:50.000 --> 31:55.520
(upbeat music playing)

32:22.560 --> 32:24.440
Hey, Patty, have you seen my...

32:32.000 --> 32:33.360
I don't want to talk about it.

32:36.560 --> 32:37.800
(bell rings)

32:37.880 --> 32:40.120
I just have this permission slip
in for the chess tournament,

32:40.200 --> 32:42.680
and then I get
a whole half-day off next week.

32:43.640 --> 32:45.640
Hey, curly, you're on my bus, right?

32:46.640 --> 32:48.320
Yeah. Did somebody leave that
on the bus?

32:48.400 --> 32:51.720
No. I'm just carrying it for my health.
You know who it belongs to?

32:51.800 --> 32:54.800
-Isn't that Angela's backpack?
-Oh, yeah. It is.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.640
-Thanks, curly.
-(Rickie chuckles)

33:00.560 --> 33:04.240
My parents have a vibrator.
It sounds like a lawnmower.

33:04.320 --> 33:06.640
I wish I could get away
with bicycle shorts.

33:10.440 --> 33:13.440
I can't believe you let Brian Krakow
look through my backpack.

33:13.520 --> 33:14.760
I didn't let him.

33:14.840 --> 33:18.680
He was trying to cram it in his locker,
and the sex tape fell out.

33:19.760 --> 33:22.600
-It's actually Sharon Cherski's.
-Yeah, right.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.840
Rickie, I had someone...

33:29.800 --> 33:31.600
to be with, you know?

33:32.280 --> 33:34.920
I know. I can't even imagine it.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.280
(sighs) I feel so stupid.

33:38.360 --> 33:40.560
My entire relationship
with Jordan Catalano,

33:40.640 --> 33:43.600
every minute of it has completely sucked.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.080
And now it's over.

33:46.600 --> 33:48.120
I should've just had sex with him.

33:48.200 --> 33:50.240
Why not? It would've been so simple.

33:52.840 --> 33:56.000
But maybe it shouldn't be... so simple.

33:56.640 --> 34:00.040
I mean, not that I know
what I'm talking about or anything...

34:00.680 --> 34:03.720
'cause I've never, you know,
experienced this or what have you.

34:04.400 --> 34:07.560
But even if I did meet
the perfect person...

34:10.520 --> 34:12.160
I just think
it should be like a miracle...

34:13.920 --> 34:16.640
like seeing a comet...

34:18.360 --> 34:20.320
or just feeling like you're seeing one.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.720
Seeing the other person's perfectness.

34:26.920 --> 34:28.200
Or something.

34:29.920 --> 34:32.480
And if you do it
before you're even ready...

34:33.520 --> 34:35.520
how are you going to see all that?

34:39.440 --> 34:41.040
Not that I would, like, know or anything.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.560
(toilet flushes)

34:44.120 --> 34:45.360
What you said...

34:47.000 --> 34:48.160
that was, like...

34:49.400 --> 34:51.120
so beautiful.

34:52.120 --> 34:55.320
Because that's exactly what it's like.

35:00.800 --> 35:05.600
I know we don't, like, know each
other or anything, but...

35:05.680 --> 35:07.640
could I just ask you something?

35:08.440 --> 35:09.680
Sure.

35:10.440 --> 35:12.280
Did you ever work at Big Guy Burger?

35:15.400 --> 35:19.960
(birds chirping)

35:21.960 --> 35:24.760
You always buy the cat nicer food
than I do.

35:26.200 --> 35:28.080
We delivered the brochures...

35:29.080 --> 35:32.840
so I thought I'd come home
a little earlier for a change.

35:33.360 --> 35:36.680
Have a little time
before the girls get home.

35:39.480 --> 35:41.520
-Graham, I've been thinking.
-I've been thinking, too.

35:42.560 --> 35:44.920
You're right.
I guess I got caught up in...

35:45.000 --> 35:47.520
There's nothing wrong
with being caught up. I mean...

35:47.600 --> 35:49.240
No. It's too big a risk.

35:49.800 --> 35:52.080
It'd be risking our whole future. So...

35:52.960 --> 35:54.960
-So that's it.
-What if it's worth it?

35:55.040 --> 36:00.520
Because I want you to have...
you know, what you want in life,

36:00.600 --> 36:02.200
-and if this business...
-But I do.

36:02.280 --> 36:04.120
I do have everything I want.

36:06.160 --> 36:09.680
Well, I mean, you know,
no one has everything they want.

36:10.320 --> 36:11.600
-But...
-But...

36:12.440 --> 36:14.160
as long as we have each other...

36:14.840 --> 36:17.440
That new age music swells
in the background.

36:22.960 --> 36:27.840
So you think you actually store
sexual energy between your toes?

36:30.960 --> 36:34.120
(Graham, Patty moans)

36:34.200 --> 36:36.360
(telephone rings)

36:36.440 --> 36:38.320
-The machine will get it.
-Why won't it pick up?

36:38.400 --> 36:40.520
Well, the tape is probably full.

36:40.600 --> 36:43.000
I'm the only person whoever rewinds it.

36:44.440 --> 36:46.440
God, I don't want to talk
to those travel people.

36:46.520 --> 36:47.520
It might be Hallie Lowenthal.

36:47.600 --> 36:49.840
She was going to talk
to her friend at Shearson's.

36:49.920 --> 36:52.440
Should you pick it up? Maybe?
I don't know.

36:52.520 --> 36:54.240
Why? I'm not going to go
into business with her.

36:54.320 --> 36:56.240
Well, I know... I just, um...

37:03.960 --> 37:07.440
Anyway... It's true.
Most restaurants fail.

37:07.520 --> 37:10.520
Yeah. But some of them
have to succeed, don't they?

37:12.160 --> 37:15.760
I know you think things
have gotten out of hand around here.

37:15.840 --> 37:17.440
I mean, with me.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.800
-I don't think that.
-No, they have been.

37:19.880 --> 37:22.040
But I think actually it's good.

37:22.760 --> 37:24.960
-I mean, I think it's a good thing.
-No! So... So do I.

37:25.040 --> 37:27.200
I mean, I may not know
where it's all gonna lead...

37:27.280 --> 37:31.360
I know but it'll work out.
I have faith in you.

37:32.240 --> 37:33.360
(chuckles)

37:46.960 --> 37:49.720
-Are you tired?
-Yeah.

37:52.600 --> 37:58.120
I got, like, no sleep last night.
(clears throat)

37:59.200 --> 38:00.200
Yeah, well...

38:02.120 --> 38:04.760
I actually have,
like, a million things I...

38:06.000 --> 38:07.640
-(Graham sighs)
-should be doing, too.

38:17.960 --> 38:21.680
(mellow music playing)

38:21.760 --> 38:23.280
(Graham sighs)

38:25.440 --> 38:27.000
(knock on door)

38:35.640 --> 38:37.960
-Hi. Is, uh...
-She's upstairs...

38:38.040 --> 38:42.440
playing that same mushy upsetting song,
like, 50 times in a row.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.840
Oh, great.
Well, here's her stupid backpack.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.320
You wouldn't believe what was in it.

38:46.400 --> 38:47.920
Never mind. Forget I said that.

38:48.680 --> 38:51.040
Not to mention the fact
that she still has my bicycle.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.440
She doesn't have it.

38:52.520 --> 38:55.480
-She left it at Jordan Catalano's.
-What?

38:57.440 --> 38:59.440
What do you think?
That I don't might need my own bike,

38:59.520 --> 39:02.240
-and you can just leave it all over town?
-I...

39:06.280 --> 39:07.480
Well, don't just take it.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.480
Yell back at me.

39:14.280 --> 39:18.480
I mean, did something...
I mean, obviously something happened.

39:18.560 --> 39:21.440
Nothing happened to me personally.
I just...

39:22.600 --> 39:26.840
I mean, it's just kind of sad,
that's all, about boys.

39:28.400 --> 39:29.440
What about boys?

39:31.200 --> 39:33.240
Just how they only care about...

39:34.400 --> 39:36.800
you know, getting you into bed
or something.

39:39.720 --> 39:41.200
I mean, don't they?

39:43.040 --> 39:44.280
Not all boys.

39:45.800 --> 39:46.800
So, is that...

39:48.800 --> 39:51.520
is that, like, a problem you're having?

39:53.120 --> 39:54.440
Mm-hmm.

39:57.800 --> 40:01.240
I mean, I think about it...
all the time but...

40:01.320 --> 40:02.840
Wait. You think about it all the time?

40:02.920 --> 40:05.280
Brian! Yeah. Shut up!

40:05.360 --> 40:07.640
Boys don't have the monopoly
on thinking about it.

40:07.720 --> 40:09.560
-They don't?
-No.

40:11.680 --> 40:13.360
Okay. Well...

40:15.040 --> 40:16.440
I still want my bike back.

40:19.440 --> 40:21.520
(door closes)

40:21.600 --> 40:24.720
(upbeat music playing)

40:33.320 --> 40:35.640
(car engine starts)

41:03.880 --> 41:05.760
She left her bike at my place.

41:07.440 --> 41:08.840
Actually, it's my bike.

41:10.760 --> 41:11.760
Oh.

41:14.760 --> 41:15.800
I don't need it right now.

41:15.880 --> 41:19.400
I'll just leave it here
in case she needs it, you know.

41:21.440 --> 41:22.440
Is she home?

41:24.280 --> 41:25.280
I'm not sure.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.480
(knock on door)

41:35.840 --> 41:37.200
I brought your bike back.

41:39.120 --> 41:40.520
Or whoever's it is.

41:48.280 --> 41:50.040
So are we supposed to say something,

41:51.360 --> 41:52.600
like, official, because...

41:52.680 --> 41:54.080
You don't have to say anything.

42:01.920 --> 42:04.600
It's sort of like when you were letting me
drive your car...

42:07.240 --> 42:10.840
and I loved it.
It made me feel really powerful.

42:12.880 --> 42:15.000
But also really terrified,

42:16.440 --> 42:18.040
like I wasn't ready...

42:18.920 --> 42:20.440
for that much freedom.

42:23.880 --> 42:24.880
Well...

42:26.440 --> 42:27.560
you should know...

42:30.480 --> 42:32.000
I won't hold it against you...

42:32.880 --> 42:34.560
if your name ever comes up.

42:36.360 --> 42:37.840
Thanks.

42:39.920 --> 42:41.080
No sweat.

42:48.800 --> 42:51.920
Because it... It is a big deal.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.560
I mean,
sex made your whole life start.

42:53.640 --> 42:56.440
If you think about life
as a circle or something,

42:56.520 --> 42:58.760
then sex and death are the same.

42:58.840 --> 43:01.760
Look, I'm not...
I'm not saying they're the same. I mean...

43:01.840 --> 43:03.560
I've thought about having sex
with you and...

43:03.640 --> 43:06.520
God! I've never seriously thought
about killing you.

43:06.600 --> 43:07.600
Okay!

43:09.120 --> 43:10.120
Okay.

43:15.040 --> 43:16.120
At least...

43:17.400 --> 43:19.360
you got in some driving practice.

43:21.680 --> 43:22.680
Yeah.

43:23.440 --> 43:24.640
Just, uh...

43:26.480 --> 43:28.560
don't take your turns
too wide or anything.

43:32.240 --> 43:33.720
I'm sure you won't.

43:34.920 --> 43:37.240
(Angela) <i>Sometimes someone says</i>
<i>something really small...</i>

43:39.000 --> 43:42.200
<i>and it just fits right into this</i>
<i>empty place in your heart.</i>

43:52.480 --> 43:53.480
Your hair.

43:56.440 --> 43:58.440
The way it's really soft...

44:00.400 --> 44:01.640
like, in the back.

44:04.640 --> 44:06.680
I'm really going to miss that.

44:09.040 --> 44:10.240
Yeah.

44:16.480 --> 44:17.560
Well...

44:18.600 --> 44:20.680
I guess this is it, so...

44:24.320 --> 44:25.800
Goodbye.

44:28.720 --> 44:29.720
Bye.

44:33.280 --> 44:34.480
I'll see you tomorrow.

44:48.680 --> 44:54.080
(tranquil music playing)

45:01.280 --> 45:03.920
(Angela) <i>People always say</i>
<i>how you should be yourself,</i>

45:04.600 --> 45:08.040
<i>like, "yourself" is this definite thing,</i>

45:08.520 --> 45:10.680
<i>like a toaster or something,</i>

45:11.440 --> 45:13.320
<i>like you can know what it is, even.</i>

45:14.200 --> 45:17.080
<i>But every so often, I'll have, like...</i>

45:18.280 --> 45:19.320
<i>a moment...</i>

45:20.040 --> 45:22.840
<i>when just being myself, in my life,</i>

45:23.520 --> 45:24.840
<i>right where I am...</i>

45:25.760 --> 45:28.520
<i>is, like... enough.</i>

45:50.160 --> 45:55.760
