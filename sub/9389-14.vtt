00:02.002 --> 00:08.550
(SINGING) It seems today that all you see
is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:08.634 --> 00:11.678
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.762 --> 00:14.848
ALL: On which we used to rely?

00:14.932 --> 00:18.268
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.352 --> 00:21.563
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

00:21.647 --> 00:23.065
All the things that make us

00:23.148 --> 00:24.816
Laugh and cry!

00:24.900 --> 00:29.738
ALL: He's a family guy!

00:34.868 --> 00:36.828
Hey, everybody.
Look what came in the mail.

00:36.912 --> 00:39.039
We got invitations
to Jillian's wedding.

00:39.122 --> 00:41.083
"Jillian's wedding"?
She's getting married?

00:41.166 --> 00:42.334
Wow, that's great.

00:42.417 --> 00:43.627
It looks like
she finally found someone

00:43.710 --> 00:45.295
after dating that last loser.

00:45.379 --> 00:46.713
She dated someone after me?

00:46.797 --> 00:48.465
No. See how I set up my own joke?

00:48.549 --> 00:50.259
You walked right into it, Brian.

00:50.342 --> 00:51.969
Walk right in

00:52.052 --> 00:53.762
Sit right down

00:53.846 --> 00:56.056
Stewie's gonna
make you the fool

00:56.139 --> 00:57.891
Peter, here's your invite.

00:57.975 --> 00:59.393
Chris, Meg,

00:59.476 --> 01:01.603
Stewie and me.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.772
Uh... probably
one more in there.

01:03.856 --> 01:05.440
No, doesn't look like it.

01:05.524 --> 01:07.401
Oh, yeah, here it is. Brian.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.403
Oh, no, wait, it's for "B-Ryan."

01:09.486 --> 01:11.029
Aw, cool, Mrs. G.

01:11.113 --> 01:13.115
Thanks for letting me stay here
the last couple weeks.

01:14.658 --> 01:16.034
I've enjoyed his company.

01:16.118 --> 01:17.953
She invited everybody except me?

01:18.036 --> 01:20.080
What the hell?
We dated for six months.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.791
Ouch. Well, Brian, looks like
you're the odd man out,

01:22.875 --> 01:24.877
like a non-praying mantis.

01:24.960 --> 01:28.046
Bless us, O Lord, for these
gifts we are about to receive.

01:28.130 --> 01:30.174
Help us to be mindful
of all our blessings and...

01:30.257 --> 01:32.342
(LOUD CHEWING)

01:43.770 --> 01:45.647
Brian, I'm filling
out my RSVP card

01:45.731 --> 01:47.107
and I don't know
whether I should get

01:47.191 --> 01:48.525
the salmon or the Snausages.

01:48.609 --> 01:49.610
They're having Snausages?

01:49.693 --> 01:51.111
Yeah, it sounds like fun.

01:51.195 --> 01:53.780
Big deal. I could care less
about going to that wedding.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.282
Well, look on the bright side,
it frees you up

01:55.365 --> 01:56.408
to go to Cleveland's barbecue.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.160
Cleveland's having a barbecue?

01:58.243 --> 02:00.329
Oh, boy, this is really awkward.

02:00.412 --> 02:01.538
None of this is awkward.

02:01.622 --> 02:02.873
I've moved on from Jillian.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.583
I've dated plenty
of other girls since her.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.418
I never do computer dating.

02:06.502 --> 02:08.295
Yeah, me neither.

02:08.378 --> 02:10.631
So, you're 27?

02:10.714 --> 02:12.257
Well, that picture was, you know,

02:12.341 --> 02:14.218
it was posted
a couple years ago.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.553
So, you're...
You're a golden retriever?

02:16.637 --> 02:19.139
Well, it's a retriever mix

bra-doodle.

02:21.892 --> 02:24.061
Where is that waitress?

02:24.144 --> 02:26.647
Fine, if you're so over her,
we should all go out to dinner.

02:26.730 --> 02:29.066
You, me, Jillian,
and her fiancé,

02:29.149 --> 02:30.150
unless you're uncomfortable.

02:30.234 --> 02:31.443
I would have no problem with that.

02:31.527 --> 02:33.111
I'd love to meet the fiancé.

02:33.195 --> 02:35.405
Great, and I'm sure
DeShawn would love to meet you.

-"DeShawn"?
-Ahh, his name's Derek!

to be here already.

-Are you still going out with him?
-I guess so.

02:49.086 --> 02:50.629
I hate how he
pushes his bangs

02:50.712 --> 02:52.464
out of his face
with every word he says.

02:52.548 --> 02:54.925
Um, order me a beer.

your upcoming nuptials.

It's a really thin bra.

Peter, I came over
to ask you something.

03:11.233 --> 03:13.485
Will you give me away
at my wedding?

03:13.569 --> 03:15.404
Wow, sure.
That'd be great.

03:15.487 --> 03:17.823
Jillian, don't you
want your own father to give you away?

03:17.906 --> 03:19.283
Lois, don't ruin this for me.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.326
Don't ruin this
like you ruined Kix cereal.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.872
Mmm, this Kix cereal
is good-tasting.

03:24.955 --> 03:27.291
And it's good for you.

03:27.374 --> 03:28.667
Nyah!

03:29.084 --> 03:31.461
My father can't give me away
'cause he's dead.

-Peter would be happy to do the honors.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.593

I know!
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

pretty good French you speak there.

to come in to work today.

help you with that elbow.

Yeah, it feels a lot better.

06:00.652 --> 06:03.113
I mean, I probably had
a lot to drink last night,

06:03.197 --> 06:04.740

might've offended you,

-I'm sorry.
-No, it's okay.

out of his fur before.

a fun night though, right?

that goes to my school.

a gay friend on the show--

-A friend on the show?
-Hey, you know what?

to go shoot now.

I have the perfect hat for this!

comfortable being on camera.

it was unisex.

Wow, Spencer does
look like a monkey.

07:37.916 --> 07:40.377
Spencer, I am so over
your selfishness.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.546
What do you want?
I came out to Hollywood.

07:42.629 --> 07:45.716
I'm on camera all day,
and I turned my back on my own kind.

07:47.593 --> 07:49.386

there's Brody Jenner.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.888

07:50.971 --> 07:52.431
I can't believe that

07:52.514 --> 07:54.516

07:54.600 --> 07:56.852
-Bruce Jenner is a man.
-No, Brian.

07:56.935 --> 07:58.896
That's what the press
would have you believe, but he's not.

This is where they edit
the show together.

Lauren, we got a rough cut
of next week's episode.

08:08.030 --> 08:09.406
-Can you cue that up, Terry?
-Sure.

08:11.033 --> 08:12.826
I need to be, like, fine

08:12.910 --> 08:14.995
to be alone and, like, not even
want to date someone, and then

08:15.078 --> 08:16.496
I'll know I'll be fine to get
into a relationship.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.707
That's it?

08:18.790 --> 08:20.584
-That was like five seconds.
-It's okay.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.461
They fill the rest
with shots of street signs,

08:22.544 --> 08:23.670
and fronts of restaurants,

His name's Brian Griffin.

Lauren last night.

That's fantastic.

isn't it?

This new Lauren Conrad
relationship?

09:34.324 --> 09:36.493
When asked about their sex life,
Brian was quoted as saying,

09:36.577 --> 09:38.537
"Oh, yeah, we just do it me style."

that dog a bone,

caviar spoons
are carved from bone.

because it reacts chemically

17:35.389 --> 17:36.640
What is this going to do?

17:36.723 --> 17:38.058
It's going to make her jealous.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.227
You out on the town
with a hot date.

17:40.310 --> 17:41.520
How are you a hot date?

17:41.603 --> 17:43.772
Whoa! You're angry at her, not me.

17:43.856 --> 17:44.857
No wonder you're alone.

17:50.571 --> 17:52.155
This isn't working at all.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.992
-She doesn't even know we're here.
-Oh, she will, Brian.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.327
And she's going to be upset that your
date is so into you.

17:57.411 --> 18:00.330
Okay, ready? I've been reading up
on things that sound sexy.

18:00.414 --> 18:03.458
Oh, Brian, I can't wait
till after dinner,

18:03.542 --> 18:05.544
'cause then we'll go home,
and you can watch me

18:05.627 --> 18:07.504
-have my period.
-What the hell's wrong with you?

18:07.588 --> 18:09.506
-That's not sexy.
-Hey, Brian.

18:09.590 --> 18:10.966
I just noticed you over here.

18:11.049 --> 18:12.426
Hi, I'm Jillian.

18:12.509 --> 18:13.886
-Desiree.
-Charmed.

18:13.969 --> 18:15.304
Well, I wish we could stay,

18:15.387 --> 18:17.556
but we have quite
an exciting evening planned.

18:17.639 --> 18:19.016
Oh, oh, yeah, right.

18:19.099 --> 18:20.517
We're really hitting the town.

18:20.601 --> 18:22.853
Yes, we're going
douche the night away.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.479
Oh. Well, have fun.

18:24.563 --> 18:25.981
You two are a really cute couple.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.774
Hey, Desiree.

18:27.858 --> 18:30.068
Oh. Hey, Lee.

18:30.152 --> 18:31.528
Brian, this is Lee.

18:31.612 --> 18:32.613
Lee, this is Brian.

18:32.696 --> 18:36.241
I know Lee from... Starbucks.

18:36.325 --> 18:38.076
MAN: Hey, is that Desiree?

18:41.246 --> 18:42.873
That's it. I mean...

18:42.956 --> 18:44.291
I don't know
what else I can do.

18:44.374 --> 18:45.751
The wedding's tomorrow,

18:45.834 --> 18:47.753
and she hasn't shown
any signs of leaving Derek.

18:47.836 --> 18:49.796
I've completely
run out of options.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.840
Not quite, Brian.
There's still one thing you can do.

18:51.924 --> 18:53.091
What's that?

18:53.175 --> 18:54.426
Go for broke.

18:54.510 --> 18:56.178
Just throw all your cards
on the table at once.

18:56.261 --> 18:57.429
Show her that you love her

18:57.513 --> 18:59.389
in a way she can't possibly ignore.

-Hello?

19:01.141 --> 19:03.101
Oh, hey, Lee!

19:03.185 --> 19:05.062
No, it's not a bad time.

19:06.563 --> 19:09.525
Yeah, I still have those boots.

19:09.608 --> 19:12.361
Well, maybe I'll wear 'em
and maybe I won't.

do you take Derek...

19:35.717 --> 19:38.011
Wait!

19:38.095 --> 19:40.305
Jillian, I'm in love with you.

19:40.389 --> 19:42.599
I want you--
No, I need you...

19:42.683 --> 19:44.476
with all my heart and soul.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.103
And my only regret is that

19:46.186 --> 19:48.021
I didn't realize it
when we were together.

19:48.105 --> 19:50.065
Those were the happiest
days of my life,

19:50.148 --> 19:52.526
and I want more of those days.

19:52.609 --> 19:56.280
Please, Jillian...
I love you.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.490
Will you please take me back?

19:58.574 --> 20:01.034
Brian... no.

20:01.118 --> 20:02.661
You had your chance.

20:02.744 --> 20:05.038
I mean, I thought
you were my soul train,

20:05.122 --> 20:06.665
but you didn't want me.

20:06.748 --> 20:08.083
-Soul mate.
-Soul food.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.918
I'm sorry,

20:10.002 --> 20:12.087
but I'm in love
with Derek now.

20:12.171 --> 20:13.797
I see.

20:13.881 --> 20:15.966
And you really feel that way?

20:16.049 --> 20:19.011
Yeah. I mean,
he's everything I have,

20:19.094 --> 20:21.096
especially since my mom
died of cancer.

first dance.

20:57.216 --> 20:58.425
I guess you're right.

20:58.509 --> 21:00.135
I still feel like crap, though.

Well, look at it this way.
You may have lost Jillian,

21:02.679 --> 21:04.806
but you can at least
be happy that she's happy.

21:04.890 --> 21:06.308
Plus, you can always call Lauren.

-No, I can't.
-Why not?

to speak to me again.
