Previously on Legends of Tomorrow...

00:01.454 --> 00:03.638
Sara can never find out
the truth about Ava.

00:03.639 --> 00:04.905
- I'm a...
- You're a clone.

00:04.906 --> 00:05.924
Future clone thing?

00:05.925 --> 00:09.291
The first totem bearers
imprisoned a great evil.

00:09.292 --> 00:11.477
And time is his cage.

00:11.478 --> 00:14.312
If you cannot defeat me in this vessel,

00:14.313 --> 00:17.833
how will you stop me once
I've assumed my true form?

00:17.834 --> 00:20.354
Our family's destruction looms in 1992.

00:20.355 --> 00:21.861
You promised you'd save us.

00:25.792 --> 00:26.804
Kuasa.

00:26.805 --> 00:29.665
Gideon, set a course. I
have to save my family.

00:32.155 --> 00:35.057
Code 1-3-1! All hands on the bridge!

00:35.058 --> 00:36.625
- What's going on?
- Yeah.

00:36.626 --> 00:38.293
I gotta get back to "Lord of the Rings."

00:38.294 --> 00:39.996
You read?

00:39.997 --> 00:41.931
Code 1-3-1.

00:41.932 --> 00:43.665
Come on, guys, I wrote
a whole a whole memo.

00:43.666 --> 00:45.000
Yeah, nobody read it.

00:45.001 --> 00:46.735
- I did.
- Thank you, Ray.

00:46.736 --> 00:49.271
- Pancakes for breakfast.
- No, 1-3-1 is not... is it?

00:49.272 --> 00:51.140
Yeah. Does that mean no pancakes?

00:51.141 --> 00:53.642
Anyway, I wrote a song to help
us remember all the codes.

00:53.643 --> 00:55.510
It goes like this. From the top!

00:55.511 --> 00:57.779
¶ If the code is 1-1-1 ¶

00:57.780 --> 01:00.416
¶ Mallus escaped the time dungeon ¶

01:00.417 --> 01:02.351
¶ If the code is 1-1-2... ¶

01:02.352 --> 01:03.685
All right, Nate, just tell us.

01:03.686 --> 01:05.521
Someone stole the jumpship.

01:07.457 --> 01:09.157
Where's Amaya?

01:09.358 --> 01:11.928
According to the jumpship logs,

01:11.929 --> 01:13.996
Zambesi, 1992.

01:13.997 --> 01:16.866
Right before the warlords
destroyed her village.

01:16.867 --> 01:18.867
And she dies.

01:18.868 --> 01:20.938
The old her, that is.

01:23.253 --> 01:25.040
The temporal zone
is getting real choppy.

01:25.041 --> 01:26.642
Yeah, the timeline was
crumbling even before Amaya

01:26.643 --> 01:28.010
decided to change history.

01:28.011 --> 01:29.412
If that happens, the Darhks will be able

01:29.413 --> 01:30.946
to free their demon.

01:30.947 --> 01:33.715
Oh, well, I'd better
get back to my movie.

01:33.716 --> 01:35.218
And we'd better stop Amaya

01:35.219 --> 01:36.587
before she does something reckless.

01:36.588 --> 01:39.488
- Gideon, plot a course for...
- Pardon me, Captain Lance.

01:39.489 --> 01:42.324
But we are receiving an
urgent call from Mr. Hunter.

01:42.325 --> 01:44.494
- You good?
- Gideon, put him on.

01:45.562 --> 01:47.462
The Bureau needs backup.

01:47.463 --> 01:49.066
Grodd's going after Barry.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.368
Well, that explains the time turbulence.

01:52.369 --> 01:54.203
The Flash is always in trouble.

01:54.204 --> 01:56.740
- It's kind of his thing.
- Not that particular Barry.

02:29.072 --> 02:30.639
All right, people, we're dealing with

02:30.640 --> 02:33.609
two anachronisms now,
Zambesi and young Obama.

02:33.610 --> 02:34.910
Wally, Nate, I want you guys

02:34.911 --> 02:36.345
to go talk some sense into Amaya.

02:36.346 --> 02:37.613
You mean, convince her
to stand down while

02:37.614 --> 02:39.448
her village and family is torn apart?

02:39.449 --> 02:42.918
What if I use my temporal
simulator to find some loophole

02:42.919 --> 02:45.656
that Amaya can use to help save Zambesi?

02:47.391 --> 02:48.791
All right, do it.

02:48.792 --> 02:51.327
The rest of us, we're on Obamacare.

02:55.986 --> 02:58.768
You will not escape.

02:58.769 --> 03:00.335
Grodd will complete his mission.

03:01.871 --> 03:06.275
Time to make America Grodd again.

03:06.276 --> 03:07.643
Clearly, you have some grievances.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.447
But perhaps we can look
for a common ground.

03:15.184 --> 03:16.219
Or not.

03:17.787 --> 03:20.590
Finally, the cage is breaking.

03:23.192 --> 03:26.629
I can feel his arrival.

03:28.765 --> 03:29.933
Oh, goodie.

Yes, resist.

03:50.287 --> 03:53.222
You will only prolong your suffering.

04:00.196 --> 04:02.699
Should have wasted your
hairy ass in 'Nam.

04:07.236 --> 04:08.671
Run, Barry, run!

04:11.774 --> 04:15.344
A hairless ape who fights with fire.

04:15.345 --> 04:17.247
How primitive.

04:31.094 --> 04:33.462
Nora. Nora, honey.

04:33.463 --> 04:36.399
- You okay?
- We were so close.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.701
My master was escaping his bonds.

04:38.702 --> 04:39.563
What happened?

04:39.564 --> 04:41.470
Grodd's mission must have failed.

04:41.471 --> 04:42.938
Maybe that could be a good thing.

04:42.939 --> 04:44.406
It gives you and me
time to figure out what

04:44.407 --> 04:46.075
the big guy's arrival really means.

04:47.576 --> 04:50.178
It means the end of history.

04:50.179 --> 04:52.514
A chance for us to live as gods.

04:52.515 --> 04:55.250
As gods?

04:55.251 --> 04:57.152
Man, that sounds fantastic and all.

04:57.153 --> 04:58.554
But what I just saw, it seems like

04:58.555 --> 05:00.856
there won't be a "you" anymore.

05:00.857 --> 05:03.125
It'll just be him.

05:03.126 --> 05:07.262
That's what we always wanted.

05:07.263 --> 05:10.499
Isn't it?

05:10.500 --> 05:14.103
Totally. 100%.

05:14.104 --> 05:15.804
You know, I'm just gonna
check on our grumpy gorilla

05:15.805 --> 05:17.506
and see how he screwed this thing up.

05:19.810 --> 05:23.712
I'll see you later.

05:23.713 --> 05:27.049
No, you won't.

05:27.050 --> 05:29.785
Of course.

05:29.786 --> 05:31.520
'Cause once I complete Grodd's mission,

05:31.521 --> 05:35.991
you will be gone.

05:35.992 --> 05:39.027
What I meant to say was,

05:39.028 --> 05:40.763
I'll see Mallus later.

05:49.005 --> 05:51.041
Goodbye, Nora doll.

06:03.286 --> 06:06.021
Grodd will destroy you. You're dead!

06:06.022 --> 06:08.424
Nice work. Let's get
him back to the ship.

06:08.425 --> 06:10.659
Yeah. Come on, teeny-tiny Grodd.

06:10.660 --> 06:12.460
I think we still have
some chew toys left over

06:12.461 --> 06:13.929
from the saber-toothed tiger.

06:13.930 --> 06:14.996
Nice to meet you.

- Shut up, Darren Applebottom,

06:22.405 --> 06:24.007
talent scout for the New York Knicks.

06:26.042 --> 06:27.310
What are you doing here?

06:28.611 --> 06:30.713
What are you doing here?

06:30.714 --> 06:32.514
Preventing the genocide
of my people tomorrow.

06:32.515 --> 06:34.683
We know. We're here to stop you.

06:34.684 --> 06:36.385
Peacefully.

06:36.386 --> 06:39.355
Look, Amaya, I know you're
upset about what happened

06:39.356 --> 06:42.257
to Kuasa, and all I can say is I am...

06:42.258 --> 06:45.026
I'm truly sorry.

06:45.254 --> 06:48.021
I don't blame you for my
granddaughter's death, Nathaniel.

06:49.232 --> 06:52.201
I blame the warlords who
draw closer by the minute.

06:52.202 --> 06:56.406
And I intend to stop them,
so stay out of my way.

06:58.775 --> 07:00.909
I must say, it has been
such an honor, Barack.

07:00.910 --> 07:04.579
- Oh, I go by Barry.
- I really like Barack.

07:04.580 --> 07:07.316
Well, Barack is what it says
on my birth certificate.

07:07.317 --> 07:09.118
Yeah, you might want to hold on to that.

07:12.589 --> 07:14.957
So, what's the backup plan?

07:14.958 --> 07:18.160
Well, according to Ray's
song, this is a code 2-2-2.

07:18.161 --> 07:19.562
What's that?

07:19.563 --> 07:21.629
It means we're screwed
no matter what we do.

07:21.630 --> 07:24.365
All right. Crisis averted.

07:24.765 --> 07:27.635
And a new one's just begun.

07:27.636 --> 07:29.471
You're not getting Obama.

07:29.472 --> 07:31.173
I'm not here for him.

07:31.174 --> 07:34.076
I'm here for my daughter.

07:34.077 --> 07:35.846
And I need your help.

07:39.950 --> 07:42.017
I assure you, this is
completely unnecessary.

07:42.018 --> 07:44.487
I come, as they say, in peace.

07:44.488 --> 07:47.256
And I, as they say, think
you're full of crap.

07:47.257 --> 07:48.491
I'm a changed man, Sara.

07:48.492 --> 07:51.527
The only change I want to see
you go through is from alive to dead.

07:51.528 --> 07:53.729
Ray, how we doing with
Constantine's spell?

07:53.730 --> 07:56.165
Just need one more splash of bat spleen.

07:56.166 --> 07:57.166
Sorry, bat.

07:57.167 --> 07:58.435
And that should do it.

08:01.938 --> 08:03.439
Maybe I missed an ingredient.

08:03.440 --> 08:05.374
Your Ankh symbol, it's...
it's upside down.

08:06.543 --> 08:07.776
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

08:07.777 --> 08:08.765
No, it's not!

08:09.546 --> 08:11.313
I knew it'd be difficult to
get you guys to trust me.

08:12.165 --> 08:13.082
Try impossible.

08:13.083 --> 08:15.717
Which is why I brought this
gesture of good faith.

08:15.718 --> 08:17.486
The Water Totem.

08:17.487 --> 08:19.155
I borrowed it from my daughter after

08:19.156 --> 08:21.623
she ripped it from Kuasa's chest.

08:21.624 --> 08:22.792
Sorry about that, by the way.

08:27.531 --> 08:29.397
Do you guys mind if I give
you a hand with this?

08:29.398 --> 08:31.500
You seem to be struggling a bit.

08:31.501 --> 08:33.203
Yeah? Okay, great.

08:37.770 --> 08:40.676
Cool... Now... try to choke me.

08:40.677 --> 08:43.313
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:46.447 --> 08:47.288
You... you can't.

08:47.289 --> 08:49.285
- Satisfied?
- Yeah.

08:49.286 --> 08:51.187
That Water Totem's gotta
be worth something.

08:51.188 --> 08:52.921
With all six, you guys might actually

08:52.922 --> 08:54.356
have a chance against Mallus.

08:54.357 --> 08:55.691
You mean the same demon you've been

08:55.692 --> 08:56.959
creating anachronisms to release?

08:56.960 --> 08:59.891
That was before I realized what
our partnership would cost me.

09:00.091 --> 09:01.030
Nora...

09:01.031 --> 09:03.365
Dies the moment the demon escapes.

09:03.366 --> 09:06.301
Now, I know this might
rankle you a bit, Sara,

09:06.302 --> 09:08.370
but our interests are aligned.

09:08.371 --> 09:11.406
We can save Nora and stop
Mallus from being freed,

09:11.407 --> 09:14.232
together.

09:14.233 --> 09:15.828
- No.
- Excuse me?

09:15.829 --> 09:17.346
Rory, kill him.

09:17.347 --> 09:18.513
Wait, no-no-no.

09:18.514 --> 09:20.115
Wait, wait, wait. Okay, look.

09:20.116 --> 09:21.917
I... I know Damien has done
terrible things in his past

09:21.918 --> 09:23.285
which cannot be forgiven,

09:23.286 --> 09:25.755
but I know that he loves his daughter.

09:25.756 --> 09:27.923
- We can't just kill him.
- He was already dead.

09:27.924 --> 09:29.958
Killing him would be
repairing an anachronism.

09:29.959 --> 09:32.328
Yeah, so would incarcerating
him in the Bureau.

09:32.329 --> 09:33.930
I agree with Rip.

09:33.931 --> 09:36.097
We need to think through
this situation rationally.

09:36.098 --> 09:37.367
Boss?

09:40.470 --> 09:42.704
Stand down.

09:42.705 --> 09:44.540
I'm glad to see you came to your senses.

09:44.541 --> 09:46.909
Think this makes us
straight, you're wrong.

09:52.849 --> 09:54.449
What are we even doing here, man?

09:54.450 --> 09:57.187
We need to stop Amaya, not
party with the village.

10:00.523 --> 10:02.458
There she is.

10:02.459 --> 10:05.127
Okay, great, well, let's
get her out of here.

10:05.128 --> 10:07.663
Not our Amaya.

10:07.664 --> 10:09.266
That Amaya.

10:13.469 --> 10:14.436
What's wrong?

10:14.437 --> 10:17.339
Nothing, it just means...

10:17.340 --> 10:20.175
my Amaya comes back to Zambesi

10:20.176 --> 10:23.545
and we don't grow old together.

10:23.546 --> 10:26.215
For thousands of years,

10:26.216 --> 10:30.619
the Anansi Totem has been in my family.

10:30.620 --> 10:31.920
And tonight,

10:31.921 --> 10:36.625
it is my great joy...

10:36.626 --> 10:41.298
to pass this totem down
to my own daughter.

10:42.532 --> 10:44.467
Make way

10:44.468 --> 10:50.006
for the new protector of Zambesi, Esi.

11:01.718 --> 11:05.754
Kuasa, where is Esi, child?

11:05.755 --> 11:09.624
I'm sorry, Nana Baa, but

11:09.625 --> 11:11.695
Mother isn't coming.

11:16.332 --> 11:20.035
My daughter has chosen

11:20.036 --> 11:24.873
to reject her destiny and her duty.

11:24.874 --> 11:26.975
I am sorry.

11:26.976 --> 11:29.478
We have come here for nothing.

11:39.255 --> 11:41.757
Amaya. What just happened?

11:41.758 --> 11:43.759
My daughter rejected the totem.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.327
You sound more excited
than I thought you'd be.

11:45.328 --> 11:47.195
Esi never bonded with the totem.

11:47.196 --> 11:50.300
This is why the warlords were
able to destroy my village.

11:51.434 --> 11:54.069
You think you can convince
Esi to be a totem bearer.

11:54.070 --> 11:56.339
She'll protect the village tomorrow.

11:56.340 --> 11:59.274
She'll protect Kuasa.
Everything will change.

11:59.275 --> 12:01.043
That's the problem.

12:01.044 --> 12:02.911
I saw what happened with Barry
Allen when he went back

12:02.912 --> 12:04.213
and stopped his mother's murder,

12:04.214 --> 12:06.581
a little thing called Flashpoint.

12:06.582 --> 12:08.718
We can't change history. I'm sorry.

12:08.719 --> 12:11.654
Tell her, Nate.

12:11.655 --> 12:13.589
Nate?

12:13.590 --> 12:14.856
I can't believe I'm gonna say this,

12:14.857 --> 12:16.626
but screw history for once.

12:18.327 --> 12:20.596
Okay, so you go talk to your daughter,

12:20.597 --> 12:22.131
and I go talk to you,

12:22.132 --> 12:23.932
the older you.

12:26.302 --> 12:28.472
You always had a way with her.

12:29.939 --> 12:31.307
Come on.

12:31.308 --> 12:33.377
Wait, we doing what?

12:34.778 --> 12:37.481
So, listen...

12:38.781 --> 12:40.349
Are you okay?

12:40.350 --> 12:42.151
The hardest thing I ever
had to do in my life

12:42.152 --> 12:44.119
was let Darhk live.

12:44.120 --> 12:47.022
And now he's back, and it is taking

12:47.023 --> 12:52.129
every ounce of self-control
not to kill him.

12:53.329 --> 12:58.033
And I keep asking myself, "Why?"

12:58.034 --> 13:00.068
For the good of the mission.

13:00.069 --> 13:01.770
"For the good of the mission."

13:01.771 --> 13:03.138
Listen to yourself.

13:03.139 --> 13:04.707
You sound like some government...

13:04.708 --> 13:07.443
- Clone?
- I was gonna say "stiff."

13:07.444 --> 13:09.044
You know, Rip thought I could
talk some sense into you,

13:09.045 --> 13:11.312
- but maybe...
- Wait.

13:11.313 --> 13:13.448
You're here because of Rip?

13:13.449 --> 13:16.718
Why would you do anything for that man?

13:16.719 --> 13:18.954
Ava, he lied to you.

13:18.955 --> 13:21.957
He implanted false
memories into your head.

13:21.958 --> 13:24.593
He hired actors to pretend
to be your parents.

13:24.594 --> 13:26.128
I mean, what more is it gonna take

13:26.129 --> 13:27.562
to get you to confront him?

13:27.563 --> 13:29.965
I am prioritizing the mission
over my own personal baggage.

13:29.966 --> 13:31.668
You and your team should try it sometime.

13:34.070 --> 13:37.272
No, that's not what you're doing.

13:37.273 --> 13:39.007
You're covering,

13:39.008 --> 13:40.876
because you're afraid of
what you might find out.

13:40.877 --> 13:42.577
What else is there to find out, Sara?

13:42.578 --> 13:44.179
I'm one of thousands.
I was grown in a lab.

13:44.180 --> 13:46.081
There has to be more to the story, Ava,

13:46.082 --> 13:48.417
and you deserve to know.

13:48.418 --> 13:50.518
Look, you need...

13:50.519 --> 13:53.122
You need to talk to Rip now.

13:59.596 --> 14:03.065
Could do with a wee nip myself.

14:03.066 --> 14:05.066
Everything good, Director Sharpe?

14:05.067 --> 14:06.202
Peachy.

14:06.203 --> 14:07.869
Are we good to

14:07.870 --> 14:10.972
transport Mr. Darhk back to the Bureau?

14:10.973 --> 14:14.543
No, Rip, we're not.

14:14.709 --> 14:15.603
Where are you going?

14:15.604 --> 14:17.612
To go talk to someone
who can think straight

14:17.613 --> 14:19.882
when the whole world has gone crazy.

14:19.883 --> 14:22.117
So what you're saying is

14:22.118 --> 14:24.686
you won't aid the man
that killed your sister,

14:24.687 --> 14:27.155
even if it will prevent
Mollusk from escaping...

14:27.156 --> 14:28.690
"Mallus."

14:28.691 --> 14:31.659
From escaping his
inter-dimensional prison

14:31.660 --> 14:33.695
and wreaking havoc across time?

14:33.696 --> 14:35.264
Yeah, when you put it that way,

14:35.265 --> 14:36.565
it does sound kind of petty.

14:36.566 --> 14:39.068
Not at all. It sounds...

14:39.069 --> 14:40.102
It sounds human.

14:40.103 --> 14:42.570
Okay. But then what?

14:42.571 --> 14:44.773
I'm just supposed to
hand Darhk over to Ava

14:44.774 --> 14:47.075
and let the Time Bureau deal with him?

14:47.076 --> 14:50.379
Your ex is clinging to
rules and regulations

14:50.380 --> 14:52.214
in the face of the startling revelation

14:52.215 --> 14:54.182
that she is...

14:54.183 --> 14:56.952
I'm sorry... a clone, was it?

14:56.953 --> 14:59.521
But here's the thing.

14:59.522 --> 15:02.758
I'm not convinced the
Bureau is best equipped

15:02.759 --> 15:05.194
to stop a demon.

15:05.195 --> 15:07.929
No, it sounds like that calls for

15:07.930 --> 15:11.801
a much more unorthodox approach.

15:14.837 --> 15:16.907
I really miss you.

15:23.187 --> 15:25.214
Oh, hi guys.

15:25.215 --> 15:27.282
I do hope you're not feeling all

15:27.283 --> 15:29.184
killy-killy, stabby-stabby.

15:29.185 --> 15:32.554
I want you to listen to me carefully.

15:32.555 --> 15:35.257
I don't believe for a
second that you've changed.

15:35.258 --> 15:38.026
You're still the same
cowardly son of a bitch

15:38.027 --> 15:39.994
that put an arrow in my sister.

15:39.995 --> 15:42.364
But I will work with you to defeat Mallus

15:42.365 --> 15:43.999
under one condition.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.667
After this is over,

15:45.668 --> 15:49.037
I'm putting you back in the
ground where you belong.

15:49.038 --> 15:50.173
Deal.

16:04.672 --> 16:07.842
Is... so, do any of these flashing
screens actually do anything?

16:07.843 --> 16:09.175
Focus, Damien.

16:09.176 --> 16:11.078
How do we capture your demon daughter?

16:11.539 --> 16:12.879
If we coordinate a strike

16:12.880 --> 16:14.481
between the Legends and the Time Bureau,

16:14.482 --> 16:16.583
we might be able to take her down.

16:16.584 --> 16:18.785
How did that work for you
in Victorian London?

16:18.786 --> 16:22.890
Besides, my little angel's only
gotten more powerful since.

16:22.891 --> 16:25.225
What if we just ask Nora nicely?

16:25.527 --> 16:28.028
I did have a bit of a
connection with her in Berlin.

16:28.850 --> 16:29.863
Not that kind.

16:29.864 --> 16:32.599
All right, maybe she'll
listen to her dear old dad.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.201
Not anymore. Nora only
listens to Mallus now.

16:35.202 --> 16:37.437
He's always in her ear.

16:37.525 --> 16:40.407
That's it. What if I got inside Nora?!

16:40.408 --> 16:42.976
Not like that.

16:42.977 --> 16:44.778
What if I shrunk down,

16:44.779 --> 16:48.181
flew into her ear and
pretended to be Mallus?

16:48.182 --> 16:49.583
Okay, new guy on the team here.

16:49.584 --> 16:51.084
Is that a joke plan or a real plan?

16:51.085 --> 16:53.320
- We are so screwed.
- No, this could work.

16:53.321 --> 16:55.956
We just have to convince her
that it's actually him.

16:55.957 --> 16:59.493
This is how you would serve your city.

16:59.494 --> 17:02.429
You would risk its utter ruin.

17:02.430 --> 17:03.831
That's it.

17:03.832 --> 17:06.133
I did what I judged to be right.

17:06.134 --> 17:09.569
What you judged to be right?

17:09.570 --> 17:12.638
You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor,

17:12.640 --> 17:15.175
in the hands of a witless halfling!

17:15.175 --> 17:19.112
Whoa, the vocal similarity
to Mallus is uncanny.

17:19.113 --> 17:21.481
- Quiet!
- Gideon?

17:21.482 --> 17:23.116
Who is that actor?

17:23.117 --> 17:25.654
And how can we get him without
dealing with his agent?

17:25.703 --> 17:27.396
- DENETHOR
- Red leather, yellow leather. Yeah?

17:27.396 --> 17:28.282
NEW ZEALAND - 1999

17:28.289 --> 17:29.923
- Mis... mister Noble?
- What?

17:29.924 --> 17:32.092
We have some... last-minute rewrites.

17:32.093 --> 17:34.161
No worries! We'll fix 'em in post!

17:34.162 --> 17:38.732
Tell Peter Jackson no more chickens, huh?

17:38.733 --> 17:40.900
I ate four this morning, eh?

17:40.901 --> 17:42.503
- So what's up, mate?
- Yeah, so.

17:42.504 --> 17:44.104
Rewrites... from Peter.

17:44.105 --> 17:46.106
And he'd like me to...
run lines with you.

17:46.107 --> 17:47.707
You're kidding.

17:47.708 --> 17:50.911
Okay. Let's see.

17:50.912 --> 17:53.180
"Nora, you must heed my command."

17:53.181 --> 17:54.548
That's good. That's good.

17:54.549 --> 17:56.183
- Who's Nora?
- Nora.

17:56.184 --> 17:58.218
Nora, she's a new character that...

17:58.219 --> 18:01.388
well... they wanted to beef up
the female presence in the film.

18:01.389 --> 18:02.690
You can't do that, mate.

18:02.691 --> 18:04.024
It's Tolkien, "Lord of the Rings."

18:04.025 --> 18:06.459
I know... but it's a studio note.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.529
Oh, studio note. Very good
note, yeah, all right.

18:08.530 --> 18:09.963
Yeah, from the top?

18:11.699 --> 18:13.934
"Nora, you must heed my command."

18:14.167 --> 18:15.635
"What is it, Master?"

18:15.636 --> 18:17.637
"Go to the Waverider, Nora."

18:17.638 --> 18:19.606
"I cannot go to the Waverider."

18:19.607 --> 18:22.909
"The totems are ripe for the picking."

18:22.910 --> 18:24.210
This is crap, isn't it? Aye?

18:24.211 --> 18:26.045
- Oh, well...
- I mean, who wrote this?

18:26.046 --> 18:27.581
- I mean, somebody...
- Don't... don't worry about it.

18:27.582 --> 18:28.915
- Took a lot of time...
- Don't worry about it.

18:28.916 --> 18:30.617
"The totems are ripe for the picking.

18:30.618 --> 18:32.586
Your father will lead you to them."

18:32.587 --> 18:33.370
"My father?"

18:37.592 --> 18:41.094
Esi.

18:41.095 --> 18:42.963
Who are you?

18:42.964 --> 18:45.298
I am a distant cousin.

18:45.299 --> 18:47.433
I came for the ceremony.

18:47.434 --> 18:49.237
Sorry to disappoint you.

18:52.039 --> 18:53.874
I love it here.

18:53.875 --> 18:55.408
When I was a child,

18:55.409 --> 18:58.879
I'd come here and lose
myself in the stars,

18:58.880 --> 19:02.415
think about where my life would lead.

19:02.416 --> 19:06.220
For as long as I can remember,

19:06.221 --> 19:10.156
the Anansi Totem has been my destiny.

19:10.157 --> 19:11.591
But now,

19:11.592 --> 19:16.262
I'm not sure I want it.

19:16.263 --> 19:18.899
- You wouldn't understand.
- Try me.

19:21.936 --> 19:25.972
My mother is the great Amaya Jiwe.

19:25.973 --> 19:29.776
She's protected our
village her entire life.

19:29.777 --> 19:32.946
She never doubted, never wavered.

19:32.947 --> 19:35.115
That's not true.

19:35.116 --> 19:40.154
Every totem bearer starts
their journey with doubt.

19:40.155 --> 19:42.423
Even your mother.

19:42.424 --> 19:44.624
I will never live up to her legacy.

19:44.625 --> 19:46.393
You have her strength

19:46.394 --> 19:49.996
and the strength of all others
who've come before her.

19:49.997 --> 19:52.566
But there is danger coming,

19:52.567 --> 19:55.102
and your people need you
to stand up for them.

20:12.353 --> 20:14.121
All right, you fathwoom into Amaya's hut,

20:14.122 --> 20:16.189
grab the totem, and we'll
give it to her daughter.

20:16.190 --> 20:18.792
Nate, I... now that you
have some space from her,

20:18.793 --> 20:20.527
I need you to come to your senses.

20:20.528 --> 20:22.228
Amaya can't see this, she's too close.

20:22.229 --> 20:24.231
But she's going to cause
more harm than good

20:24.232 --> 20:25.365
if this releases Mallus.

20:25.366 --> 20:26.933
- We don't know that.
- We do.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.069
You do.

20:33.107 --> 20:36.309
I can't not help her, Wally.

20:36.310 --> 20:38.478
I love you, man, but I will stop you

20:38.479 --> 20:42.183
if you take this too far.

20:51.359 --> 20:55.963
Like stealing candy from a very old baby.

21:22.968 --> 21:24.378
Oh, Amaya, wait.

21:24.379 --> 21:25.959
It's me.

21:25.960 --> 21:27.460
You know, I didn't think
this would do it for me,

21:27.461 --> 21:28.657
but it actually kind of does.

21:28.658 --> 21:29.636
Who are you?!

21:29.997 --> 21:31.931
- It's me, Nate.
- Who?

21:31.932 --> 21:33.266
Nate.

21:33.267 --> 21:34.701
I know it's been a while,

21:34.702 --> 21:36.069
but we used to travel
through time together.

21:36.070 --> 21:38.438
You know, do other things...

21:38.439 --> 21:40.173
If this is some kind of a joke...

21:40.174 --> 21:41.075
It's not a joke.

21:41.076 --> 21:43.723
I have pictures of us

21:43.724 --> 21:45.078
on my phone.

21:55.322 --> 21:57.157
This is me.

21:57.158 --> 21:59.926
Of course.

21:59.927 --> 22:01.294
You really don't remember, do you?

22:01.295 --> 22:02.662
How is this possible?

22:02.663 --> 22:04.230
We were part of a bitchin' team

22:04.231 --> 22:05.632
that travelled through time together...

22:05.633 --> 22:07.467
I mean, the 1942 you.

22:07.468 --> 22:11.271
Why are you here, time traveler?

22:11.272 --> 22:15.141
To keep my promise to you,

22:15.142 --> 22:17.577
by making sure your daughter Esi

22:17.578 --> 22:20.280
gets the Spirit Totem tonight.

22:20.281 --> 22:23.716
She didn't even show up
to her own ceremony.

22:23.717 --> 22:27.687
Her head is always somewhere else.

22:27.688 --> 22:30.091
She doesn't know what she wants.

22:32.292 --> 22:33.760
Yeah, you had a hard time

22:33.761 --> 22:35.729
figuring that out too
when you were her age.

22:37.865 --> 22:42.502
But, look, if Esi believed you
were truly in her corner,

22:42.503 --> 22:44.804
she wouldn't doubt herself.

22:44.805 --> 22:47.875
She would accept the totem
and be unstoppable,

22:47.876 --> 22:50.178
just like you.

22:56.663 --> 22:58.752
Hey there, Nora doll.

22:58.753 --> 23:00.420
Why am I still here?

23:00.421 --> 23:02.623
Why is the Master still in prison?

23:02.624 --> 23:04.057
You failed me!

23:04.058 --> 23:05.225
I know, it's terrible.

23:05.226 --> 23:06.959
The Legends captured Grodd,

23:06.960 --> 23:08.794
and this whole Obama thing
is just not working,

23:08.795 --> 23:12.032
so perhaps Mallus can advise us

23:12.033 --> 23:14.135
as to what to do next.

23:18.038 --> 23:21.274
Mallus only speaks when he desires.

23:21.275 --> 23:23.443
I can't just "summon" him.

23:23.444 --> 23:24.545
Well, maybe we'll just...

23:25.613 --> 23:27.080
Wait here until he

23:27.081 --> 23:28.716
gets the itch.

23:30.117 --> 23:31.651
- PLAY
- Nora.

23:32.012 --> 23:34.588
You must heed my command.

23:34.589 --> 23:36.723
It's him. He's speaking to me.

23:37.388 --> 23:38.625
Very loudly.

23:39.894 --> 23:42.295
Really? Mallus is speaking to you?

23:43.214 --> 23:44.630
I need to concentrate.

23:44.631 --> 23:48.034
Go to the Waverider, Nora.

23:48.035 --> 23:50.503
The Waverider, why?

23:50.504 --> 23:54.341
The totems are ripe for the picking.

23:54.342 --> 23:56.509
Your father will lead you to them.

23:56.510 --> 23:57.811
My father?

23:57.812 --> 24:00.580
What... what... Mallus has plans for me?

24:00.581 --> 24:01.781
I... I wonder what those are.

24:01.782 --> 24:03.683
The... the... the Legends' ship.

24:03.684 --> 24:05.518
The Master wants you to take me there.

24:05.519 --> 24:08.388
Oh, I would in a heartbeat,

24:08.389 --> 24:10.423
but we are hopelessly outnumbered, honey.

24:10.424 --> 24:11.724
There's just no way...

24:11.725 --> 24:13.160
He must take you there now, Nora.

24:13.161 --> 24:14.260
Just do it!

24:14.261 --> 24:16.096
God, do it! Don't be a fool!

24:16.097 --> 24:18.065
No problemo. Let's go.

24:22.269 --> 24:26.206
Those totems should be
around here somewhere.

24:34.982 --> 24:36.083
You.

24:41.088 --> 24:42.188
What is this?

24:42.189 --> 24:43.256
I'm sorry, sweetheart,

24:43.257 --> 24:44.424
but it's for your own good.

24:44.425 --> 24:45.626
No.

24:47.581 --> 24:50.164
No!

24:55.662 --> 24:58.097
I get it.

24:58.098 --> 24:59.432
You think that I failed you

24:59.433 --> 25:00.599
because I joined with the Legends

25:00.600 --> 25:01.867
and trapped you here.

25:01.868 --> 25:03.903
Well, you're right.

25:03.904 --> 25:05.304
I did fail you.

25:05.305 --> 25:07.038
But that's not how.

25:07.629 --> 25:09.408
I was a terrible father.

25:09.409 --> 25:13.012
I was obsessed with world domination.

25:13.013 --> 25:15.547
Because of that...

25:15.548 --> 25:17.082
I died,

25:17.083 --> 25:20.819
leaving you all alone as a child,

25:20.820 --> 25:25.625
trapped with my name
and my foolish dreams.

25:25.626 --> 25:28.695
Oh, I turned you into a demon
long before Mallus did.

25:29.796 --> 25:31.930
It's why I'm begging you,

25:31.931 --> 25:35.334
do not let him take you away from me.

25:35.335 --> 25:38.804
Your daughter is long gone.

25:38.805 --> 25:40.105
No!

25:40.106 --> 25:42.674
I know you can hear me. Fight him!

25:42.675 --> 25:45.244
Oh, there was no fight.

25:45.245 --> 25:49.448
Her soul...

25:49.449 --> 25:52.418
her flesh...

25:52.419 --> 25:55.521
were freely given.

25:55.522 --> 25:57.323
You sick son of a bitch.

25:59.426 --> 26:01.561
One more alteration to the timeline

26:01.562 --> 26:03.596
and my cage crumbles.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.440
Can't believe that worked.

26:14.441 --> 26:15.641
I can.

26:15.642 --> 26:17.677
Sara knows what she's doing.

26:17.678 --> 26:19.712
I may have my flaws, but I do know

26:19.713 --> 26:23.282
how to pick the best people for the job.

26:23.283 --> 26:24.683
So why did you pick me?

26:24.684 --> 26:26.385
What? Come on.

26:26.386 --> 26:29.322
Brilliant mind, calm demeanor,
incredible strength.

26:29.323 --> 26:33.225
And, unlike the Legends,
you actually follow rules.

26:33.226 --> 26:36.262
It almost sounds like I
was made for the job.

26:36.263 --> 26:39.131
What are you getting at?

26:39.132 --> 26:41.166
I know I'm a clone, Rip.

26:41.167 --> 26:43.102
I see.

26:43.103 --> 26:44.089
So why me?

26:46.339 --> 26:49.041
Of all the clones in 2213,
why did you pick me?

26:49.042 --> 26:50.743
You're special.

26:50.744 --> 26:52.845
So why'd you erase my memory?

26:52.846 --> 26:55.313
- I thought it would be easier.
- Easier?

26:55.314 --> 26:57.182
Easier for you or easier for me?

26:57.183 --> 26:58.951
Don't lose focus, Ava.

26:58.952 --> 27:00.819
You are too critical to this mission.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.121
Well, the good news is if I die,

27:03.122 --> 27:05.759
you can just skip off to 2213,
and get yourself another clone.

27:07.594 --> 27:10.829
Oh, my God.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.431
I wasn't even the first one, was I?

27:12.432 --> 27:14.333
We both know how hard it is

27:14.334 --> 27:16.768
to find agents as talented as you.

27:16.769 --> 27:19.738
And to find one who is also
replaceable is invaluable...

27:19.739 --> 27:21.440
How many?

27:21.441 --> 27:24.076
How many?

27:24.077 --> 27:26.645
You're the 12th.

27:26.646 --> 27:29.448
The 12th?

27:29.449 --> 27:31.149
So I wasn't even your first choice?

27:31.150 --> 27:32.451
Or your second or...

27:32.452 --> 27:34.219
You don't understand.

27:34.220 --> 27:37.356
- You are exceptional.
- Don't, Rip.

27:37.357 --> 27:39.492
Just don't.

27:46.433 --> 27:48.200
Nora's gone.

27:48.201 --> 27:50.535
It's just Mallus now.

27:50.536 --> 27:51.970
You must be enjoying this,

27:51.971 --> 27:54.240
seeing your nemesis with a broken heart.

27:54.241 --> 27:57.609
I didn't know you had a heart to break.

27:57.610 --> 28:01.781
Where was it the night
you murdered my sister?

28:01.782 --> 28:04.216
Look, what I did was unforgivable.

28:04.217 --> 28:05.851
But back then, I hadn't
loved anyone enough

28:05.852 --> 28:08.821
to understand the pain that I caused.

28:08.822 --> 28:12.458
Not that it's any comfort, but
if I could take it all back,

28:12.459 --> 28:14.360
I would.

28:14.361 --> 28:16.662
We all have regrets.

28:16.663 --> 28:19.865
But we can't undo the
things that we've done.

28:19.866 --> 28:22.568
True.

28:22.569 --> 28:25.404
But even the worst of us
can be made whole again.

28:25.405 --> 28:27.439
You, for example.

28:27.440 --> 28:29.709
League to Legend to killer to captain.

28:29.710 --> 28:31.010
That's not a bad makeover, is it?

28:31.011 --> 28:33.512
- It's not good enough.
- Why?

28:33.513 --> 28:34.813
Because you put on the Death Totem

28:34.814 --> 28:36.348
and almost killed your entire team?

28:36.349 --> 28:38.584
- Yes.
- But you didn't, did you?

28:38.585 --> 28:40.252
You know why?

28:40.253 --> 28:41.753
The same reason I'm spilling my guts to

28:41.754 --> 28:44.223
a woman who's imagined my
death 1,000 times over.

28:44.224 --> 28:45.791
More like 10,000.

28:45.792 --> 28:49.428
Love! Sara.

28:49.429 --> 28:51.230
'Cause without it, people like us,

28:51.231 --> 28:54.734
we're left alone with the darkness.

28:54.735 --> 28:56.369
That's not good for anyone, is it?

29:11.551 --> 29:15.154
I'm so proud of you, my child.

29:18.127 --> 29:20.393
Esi's embraced her destiny.

29:20.394 --> 29:22.962
Tomorrow when the marauders
come, she'll be ready.

29:22.963 --> 29:25.431
And if she's not, we'll be right
there to fight alongside her.

29:25.432 --> 29:27.633
You don't have to stay, Nathaniel.

29:27.634 --> 29:29.467
I know that what I did was selfish.

29:29.468 --> 29:33.205
You couldn't be selfish if you tried.

29:33.206 --> 29:36.908
Now, you see that boomin'
granny over there?

29:36.909 --> 29:39.845
She doesn't remember me,

29:39.846 --> 29:41.580
or the Legends.

29:41.581 --> 29:44.916
You know why that is?

29:44.917 --> 29:47.953
I must have erased my memory.

29:47.954 --> 29:50.856
And why would you do that?

29:50.857 --> 29:53.292
Because if I chose to come back here,

29:53.293 --> 29:56.461
after everything we've been through, then

29:56.462 --> 29:58.264
erasing you would be the only way

29:58.265 --> 30:01.133
that I could be the protector
my people deserve.

30:01.134 --> 30:04.870
Otherwise, I'd always be split in two.

30:04.871 --> 30:08.974
And part of me would be in love with you.

30:08.975 --> 30:10.976
I tried to reason with them,
but they won't listen.

30:10.977 --> 30:12.444
Amaya is dead set on saving her village.

30:12.445 --> 30:13.845
And Nate? He's just...

30:13.846 --> 30:15.314
- Whipped.
- I was gonna say "in love."

30:15.315 --> 30:15.914
But, yeah, same thing.

30:15.915 --> 30:18.010
Zari, please tell me that
you found a loophole

30:18.011 --> 30:19.951
that allows Amaya to save her village.

30:19.952 --> 30:21.487
There is no loophole.

30:21.488 --> 30:23.221
I've tried billions of variations,

30:23.222 --> 30:25.290
but this event has too
many ripple effects.

30:25.291 --> 30:26.992
The village has to be destroyed.

30:26.993 --> 30:28.160
Or Mallus is freed.

30:28.161 --> 30:31.897
And we're all doomed.

30:31.898 --> 30:33.632
What if we're not?

30:36.469 --> 30:37.937
We have the six totems,

30:37.938 --> 30:39.905
the only thing that Mallus is afraid of.

30:39.906 --> 30:42.441
But you can't fight what you can't see.

30:42.442 --> 30:45.510
What if the only way to kill
Mallus is to let him out?

30:45.511 --> 30:48.381
Are you really suggesting that
we allow Mallus to escape

30:48.382 --> 30:50.282
because you have a collection
of magical stones?

30:50.283 --> 30:52.851
Look, we have two choices: we
fight Amaya or we fight Mallus.

30:52.852 --> 30:55.353
And I know it sounds crazy
to let a time demon out,

30:55.354 --> 30:57.188
but it's a hell of a
lot easier to stomach

30:57.189 --> 30:58.857
than turning on a friend.

30:58.858 --> 31:00.759
Okay, yes, but didn't the
original totem bearers

31:00.760 --> 31:03.028
try and face Mallus and... and blow it?

31:03.029 --> 31:05.030
Constantine said the only reason
they couldn't kill Mallus

31:05.031 --> 31:08.000
was because the Death
Totem betrayed them.

31:08.001 --> 31:09.401
And that's not gonna happen this time.

31:09.402 --> 31:10.736
How can you be so sure?

31:10.737 --> 31:12.103
I needn't remind you what happened

31:12.104 --> 31:13.338
the last time you tried to wield it.

31:13.339 --> 31:15.474
She won't have to wield it.

31:15.475 --> 31:18.043
I will.

31:18.044 --> 31:20.245
The Death Totem was
attracted to Captain Lance

31:20.246 --> 31:22.314
because of a unique
quality we both share.

31:22.315 --> 31:24.349
We were both brought back from the dead.

31:24.350 --> 31:26.385
Plus, I have a personal stake

31:26.386 --> 31:28.353
in wanting to send
Mallus straight to Hell.

31:28.354 --> 31:31.056
He took my little girl.

31:31.057 --> 31:32.424
True as that may be,

31:32.425 --> 31:34.026
there is no chance that Captain Lance

31:34.027 --> 31:36.128
would trust you with
such a dangerous weapon.

31:39.032 --> 31:40.699
Death Totem's all yours.

31:40.700 --> 31:42.300
Sara, you can't be serious.

31:42.301 --> 31:44.002
Ava, we don't have a choice.

31:44.003 --> 31:46.338
Our only choice is to stop Amaya
and stop the anachronisms.

31:46.339 --> 31:47.539
This is insanity.

31:47.540 --> 31:49.842
Insane is what we do best, Ava.

31:49.843 --> 31:51.477
I will not condone this behavior,

31:51.478 --> 31:53.512
and the Bureau certainly
does not stand behind you.

31:53.513 --> 31:55.280
Rip, let's go. We have work to do.

31:55.281 --> 31:56.949
Remember when I told you that
we would need the Legends

31:56.950 --> 31:58.550
before this was through?

31:58.551 --> 32:01.986
Perhaps it is time that
we set aside the scalpel

32:01.987 --> 32:06.058
and let them be the chainsaw.

32:06.059 --> 32:09.561
I will consider that your resignation.

32:09.562 --> 32:11.730
Ava.

32:11.731 --> 32:13.333
Ava, wait.

32:19.005 --> 32:20.638
This plan can work and you know it.

32:20.639 --> 32:22.608
You just need to trust your gut.

32:22.609 --> 32:24.520
My gut?

32:24.521 --> 32:27.412
You mean the one that was
manufactured to factory settings?

32:27.413 --> 32:29.853
That's the same gut that 11 other
Avas used and got killed?

32:29.854 --> 32:32.785
Ava, please. Just trust me.

32:32.786 --> 32:34.219
You don't understand.

32:34.220 --> 32:36.221
This plan breaks every
rule in every book,

32:36.222 --> 32:39.090
and all I have right now
are the rules, okay?

32:39.091 --> 32:41.260
You have me.

32:49.235 --> 32:51.337
What are you doing?

32:51.338 --> 32:55.607
I'm admitting something
that could save us both.

32:55.608 --> 32:59.379
I love you.

33:00.247 --> 33:03.949
There is no "me" to love.

33:16.764 --> 33:18.365
She looks good out there,

33:18.366 --> 33:20.133
ready.

33:20.134 --> 33:23.404
Like mother, like daughter.

33:24.782 --> 33:25.949
The warlords are early.

33:25.950 --> 33:27.351
Hey! Oh, no.

33:27.352 --> 33:29.220
- Don't puma-pounce us.
- Really, Wally?

33:29.221 --> 33:31.355
- You're gonna do this?
- It's not like that, Nate.

33:31.356 --> 33:33.991
- I know why you're here.
- No, no, you really don't.

33:33.992 --> 33:36.259
Short version: Nora's on the
ship, tripping on Mallus juice.

33:36.260 --> 33:37.661
Damien Darhk gave us the Water Totem

33:37.662 --> 33:38.895
after they saved Barack Obama.

33:38.896 --> 33:40.531
And... we are here to help you

33:40.532 --> 33:42.399
create the anachronisms
so we can release Mallus,

33:42.400 --> 33:44.668
and then we can kill him.

33:44.669 --> 33:45.938
Oh, and I met John Noble.

33:48.173 --> 33:50.474
So you're working with Damien Darhk?

33:50.475 --> 33:51.942
Please, don't rub it in.

33:51.943 --> 33:53.344
And you're letting him
wield the Death Totem.

33:53.345 --> 33:55.746
In order to do justice
for someone I love.

33:55.747 --> 33:57.147
Sure you can understand that.

33:57.148 --> 33:58.782
Thankfully that is our only similarity.

33:59.611 --> 34:00.632
So.

34:00.633 --> 34:02.052
Who gets Earth? Who gets Water?

34:02.053 --> 34:05.121
Well, as a man of steel,
which is an element,

34:05.122 --> 34:07.224
I always felt a strong
connection to the earth.

34:07.225 --> 34:09.391
Actually, steel is an
alloy of iron and carbon.

34:09.393 --> 34:11.027
Also, I've watched every single episode

34:11.027 --> 34:12.496
of "Planet Earth" on Blu-ray,

34:12.496 --> 34:14.297
and I was only stoned all of the time.

34:14.297 --> 34:15.998
Can I just please have the damn totem?

34:16.000 --> 34:17.368
- Thank you.
- All yours.

34:17.369 --> 34:19.101
And Water? Anyone?

34:19.103 --> 34:21.472
Actually, water is really powerful.

34:21.473 --> 34:23.373
It... it's crucial to life on Earth.

34:23.373 --> 34:25.275
And did you know that we
are made up of 60% water?

34:25.275 --> 34:26.377
- If...
- All right, I think we get it.

34:26.378 --> 34:27.710
Take a totem.

34:27.712 --> 34:28.745
Oh, I wasn't making a pitch for one.

34:28.746 --> 34:29.780
Just take the totem!

34:29.781 --> 34:30.947
Okay, cool.

34:30.949 --> 34:32.349
All right, so is there, like,

34:32.350 --> 34:34.418
an instruction manual? A YouTube video?

34:34.418 --> 34:35.719
You better figure it out.

34:35.719 --> 34:37.888
Warlords are coming, and that means

34:37.889 --> 34:39.824
Mallus is about to make his debut.

34:42.860 --> 34:45.962
Dad?

34:45.963 --> 34:48.065
Nora.

34:48.065 --> 34:51.001
You're here but... how?

34:51.002 --> 34:54.071
The totem means you're dead.

34:54.072 --> 34:57.674
No, not yet.

34:57.675 --> 35:02.079
Mallus is trying to take me,
but I'm still fighting him.

35:02.080 --> 35:03.146
For now.

35:03.147 --> 35:06.283
But Dad?

35:06.284 --> 35:08.885
I made a mistake.

35:08.886 --> 35:10.721
I'm sorry.

35:10.722 --> 35:12.422
I don't want him to take me.

35:12.423 --> 35:15.091
Please don't let him take me. I'm scared.

35:15.774 --> 35:16.961
You ready?

35:23.511 --> 35:25.836
Yeah, let's do this before it's too late.

35:34.755 --> 35:37.481
This place has been sacred to my
people since the dawn of time.

35:37.482 --> 35:38.849
The totems will be strongest here.

35:38.850 --> 35:40.117
Well, they'd better be,

35:40.118 --> 35:41.552
'cause mine's not turning on.

35:44.088 --> 35:45.556
It's time.

35:45.557 --> 35:47.690
As soon as Esi defeats the warlords,

35:47.691 --> 35:49.527
our fight against Mallus begins.

36:03.875 --> 36:05.542
Should we help your daughter?

36:05.543 --> 36:07.411
Esi's got this.

36:07.412 --> 36:09.312
No-no-no! No-no-no!

36:09.313 --> 36:11.648
Looks like it's time to meet our monster.

36:11.649 --> 36:12.849
Or our maker.

36:12.850 --> 36:14.219
I'm not dying today.

36:16.754 --> 36:18.923
Here's Mallus.

36:23.094 --> 36:24.962
Why isn't she transforming?

36:24.963 --> 36:26.030
Rip, what gives?

36:26.031 --> 36:28.765
The historical record is showing
that Zambesi's still destroyed.

36:28.766 --> 36:30.133
That doesn't make any sense.

36:30.134 --> 36:31.436
The battle's over. The good guys won.

36:34.439 --> 36:36.873
- Rip, what's going on?
- Oh, my God.

36:36.874 --> 36:38.541
The warlords don't destroy the village.

36:38.542 --> 36:40.878
The village was destroyed by

36:40.879 --> 36:42.980
an angry gorilla.

36:49.754 --> 36:51.388
I had to. She's my daughter.

36:51.389 --> 36:52.622
You released Grodd.

36:52.623 --> 36:55.527
I need history to run its course.

37:05.761 --> 37:06.861
Your time must end.

37:06.862 --> 37:08.229
This way! Quick.

37:09.168 --> 37:10.969
You should go too, Maame.

37:10.970 --> 37:13.114
I can handle this beast.

37:13.115 --> 37:15.741
I believe in you, Obabaa.

37:35.194 --> 37:36.962
Esi.

37:36.963 --> 37:38.264
No.

37:41.150 --> 37:44.102
Amaya! Amaya!

37:44.103 --> 37:46.438
Hey, hey, are you okay?

37:47.861 --> 37:48.874
I'm okay.

37:51.444 --> 37:53.811
Nate, my family...

37:53.812 --> 37:55.213
I won't let them die.

37:55.214 --> 37:56.881
I promise.

37:56.882 --> 37:59.751
Damien, Mallus is coming.
This won't save Nora.

37:59.752 --> 38:01.486
If there's a chance in
hell, I'm gonna take it.

38:01.487 --> 38:02.922
I'll handle this.

38:06.759 --> 38:10.295
"Always incapacitate
your speedster first."

38:10.296 --> 38:11.531
That's day one stuff.

38:14.300 --> 38:15.434
Let him go.

38:20.939 --> 38:23.041
I'm warning you, don't stand in my way.

38:23.042 --> 38:25.209
I was powerful before I had this trinket,

38:25.210 --> 38:26.911
but now I'm unstoppable.

38:26.912 --> 38:28.614
Yeah, we've heard that one before.

38:33.952 --> 38:35.353
I don't want to kill you.

38:35.354 --> 38:37.088
I want to kill them to save my daughter!

38:37.089 --> 38:39.024
Why can't you understand that?!

39:03.149 --> 39:04.849
Can't move.

39:04.850 --> 39:06.151
What is happening?

39:06.152 --> 39:07.919
Foolish human.

39:07.920 --> 39:10.956
You are now mine to control.

39:10.957 --> 39:12.757
You will not harm my village!

39:12.758 --> 39:15.127
Maame! Get away from him!

39:26.672 --> 39:28.107
It worked!

39:29.842 --> 39:31.444
Amaya.

39:38.584 --> 39:39.952
Nathaniel.

39:43.189 --> 39:45.790
I... I didn't take you
for a totem bearer.

39:45.791 --> 39:48.227
That makes two of us.

39:52.497 --> 39:54.333
Nora.

40:03.375 --> 40:06.144
I'll find you. I promise.

40:06.145 --> 40:08.314
Go.

40:09.315 --> 40:10.316
Go!

40:12.918 --> 40:16.589
Hey!

40:17.723 --> 40:19.958
Performance anxiety, Raymond?

40:19.959 --> 40:21.493
You're only proving my point that

40:21.494 --> 40:24.496
this plan was never gonna work.

40:24.497 --> 40:27.600
Oh, come on. Don't make me do this.

40:30.469 --> 40:31.869
It's too bad, really.

40:31.870 --> 40:34.940
I was just beginning to
like you after Berlin.

40:44.483 --> 40:47.285
You literally stabbed me in the back.

40:47.286 --> 40:48.920
It only seemed fitting.

40:48.921 --> 40:50.856
You're lucky I wasn't
aiming for your heart.

40:50.857 --> 40:53.257
I am not gonna let Nora be taken by him.

40:53.258 --> 40:54.726
Nora's gone, Damien.

41:06.458 --> 41:10.442
Finally, I am free.

41:28.127 --> 41:29.627
No.

41:29.628 --> 41:32.330
- Nora.
- You can't help her, Ray.

41:32.331 --> 41:33.966
Oh, my God.

41:35.935 --> 41:43.009
I am so much more than a god.
