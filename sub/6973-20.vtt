[Knocking]

00:47.547 --> 00:49.481
Good afternoon.
I hope we're not bothering you.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.847
- Actually, I'm just...
- We really won't take up
much of your time.

00:51.918 --> 00:54.546
- I'm just waiting for a call.
- We're all waiting, ma'am,

00:54.621 --> 00:56.589
for the good Lord
to call in his flock.

00:56.656 --> 00:59.386
From the cable TV people.

00:59.459 --> 01:01.791
I'm just moving in.
God bless.

01:31.524 --> 01:33.458
[Knocking]

01:38.098 --> 01:41.590
Good afternoon.
I hope we're not bothering...

01:41.668 --> 01:43.966
- Yes?
- Y-You're...

01:44.037 --> 01:45.971
- Weren't you...
- Yeah, didn't we just...

01:46.039 --> 01:48.701
- Didn't you just what?
- Speak to you.

01:48.775 --> 01:53.144
- Excuse me?
- We just spoke to a woman
who... could've been your twin.

01:53.213 --> 01:55.147
- [Chuckles]
- What are you talking about?

01:55.215 --> 01:58.582
Yeah, just down the street. She's
just moving in. Your spitting image.

01:58.651 --> 02:01.381
You're really not gonna believe it
when you see her.

02:04.157 --> 02:08.321
- Ma'am?
- Go away! Get out of here!

[Groans]

03:14.561 --> 03:16.495
Okay.

04:12.684 --> 04:14.618
Betty Templeton?

04:14.686 --> 04:16.745
- Yes?
- We're with the F.B.I.

04:16.822 --> 04:20.519
We'd like to ask about an
incident... a possible religious
hate crime in your neighborhood.

04:20.591 --> 04:23.755
I just moved in yesterday. I don't
know anything about any incident.

04:23.829 --> 04:28.198
Well, we have two young men in the car
who say you do know something.

04:28.267 --> 04:30.360
[Betty]
Oh, my God!

04:30.435 --> 04:34.269
Those were the boys that were
here yesterday. What happened?

04:34.339 --> 04:37.001
They were beaten to within
an inch of their lives by each other...

04:37.075 --> 04:40.476
after visiting the home
of a woman living a few blocks over.

04:40.546 --> 04:43.538
- What woman?
- A woman who, by both
young men's accounts,

04:43.615 --> 04:46.311
fits your description.

04:46.385 --> 04:50.116
She, uh,
lives around here?

04:54.826 --> 04:57.454
Are you a practitioner
of the occult, Miss Templeton?

04:57.529 --> 05:01.898
Wicca, voodoo, Satanism,
the black art of bodily bilocation?

05:01.967 --> 05:04.492
Me?
[Chuckles] No.

05:04.570 --> 05:06.504
You know what they say.

05:06.572 --> 05:08.506
Everyone has a twin
out there somewhere.

05:10.576 --> 05:12.339
No, we don't know
what they say.

05:12.411 --> 05:16.006
Well, if there's someone who
fits my description, why isn't
someone talking to her?

05:16.081 --> 05:19.175
We went over to the house,
but it's empty. No one lives there.

05:19.251 --> 05:21.344
Frankly, we're not even sure
if she exists.

05:21.420 --> 05:23.513

06:24.149 --> 06:26.310
[Crashes]

06:33.592 --> 06:35.526
[Mulder]
This is an F.B.I. Fleet sedan...

06:35.594 --> 06:39.496
from our Kansas City
feld offce, requisitioned
by two seasoned agents there,

06:39.564 --> 06:42.590
driven into a tree at 43 miles an hour
by the female agent...

06:42.668 --> 06:45.466
in a novel effort
to kill her male counterpart.

06:47.105 --> 06:51.565
Now, you might think I'm gonna
suggest psychokinesis, P. K...

06:51.643 --> 06:56.706
someone or something controlling the
agents with remote mind-bending power.

06:56.782 --> 06:59.683
But it's not?

06:59.751 --> 07:04.347
Both agents sustained critical injuries.
Their stories eerily similar,

07:04.423 --> 07:08.621
as if they temporarily
lost control of their minds,
unable to alter their behavior.

07:11.029 --> 07:14.692
You may think that I'm gonna say
it's past lives unresolved,

07:14.766 --> 07:17.735
a fate stalking the agents
like an animal.

07:19.905 --> 07:22.066
- But you're not?
- No, the interesting thing
about these agents...

07:22.140 --> 07:25.234
is that they had worked together
for seven years previously
without any incident.

07:25.310 --> 07:28.746
- Seven years?
- Yeah, but they are not...

07:28.814 --> 07:31.180
romantically involved,
if that's what you're thinking.

07:31.249 --> 07:33.683
Not even I would be
so farfetched.

07:37.556 --> 07:40.753
You have any ideas, Scully?
Any thoughts?

07:40.826 --> 07:44.853
[Scoffs] What I'm thinking, Mulder,
is how familiar this seems.

07:44.930 --> 07:46.898
Playing Watson
to your Sherlock.

07:46.965 --> 07:50.401
You dangling clues out
in front of me one by one.

07:50.469 --> 07:53.495
It's a game, and...

07:53.572 --> 07:56.040
And as usual, you're holding
something back from me.

07:56.108 --> 07:59.009
You're not telling me
something about this case.

07:59.077 --> 08:01.341
Hmm?

08:01.413 --> 08:05.406
[Scoffs] Okay, so these agents
were investigating something.

08:05.484 --> 08:09.250
- [Chuckles]
- Something much like...

08:09.321 --> 08:13.257
what they themselves
were almost killed by.

08:13.325 --> 08:15.384
Uh, something they
came into contact with.

08:15.460 --> 08:19.226
Uh, third party.

08:19.297 --> 08:21.891
Two third parties.

08:21.967 --> 08:24.299
Twins?

08:24.369 --> 08:26.200
Relatives?

08:26.271 --> 08:28.831
Uh, doppelganger?

08:30.308 --> 08:32.606
Uh, corporeal likeness...

08:32.677 --> 08:35.202
that appears unbidden
from the spirit world,

08:35.280 --> 08:38.078
the sight of which
presages one's own death.

08:38.150 --> 08:43.782
Or... a double conjured into the world
by a technique called bilocation,

08:43.855 --> 08:46.722
which,
in psychological terms,

08:46.792 --> 08:51.661
represents the person's
secret desires and impulses,

08:51.730 --> 08:56.895
committing acts that a real person
cannot commit himself...

08:56.968 --> 08:58.959
or... herself.

09:00.372 --> 09:03.136
Mulder, the slide, please.

09:04.676 --> 09:07.008
Yes!

09:07.078 --> 09:09.979
Don't go thinking I'm gonna
start doing the autopsies.

09:24.896 --> 09:26.830
[Sighs]

09:46.384 --> 09:48.545
Excuse me.

09:48.620 --> 09:50.986
Hi. I applied for
the sales job you posted.

09:51.056 --> 09:55.288
Ah, yeah. I remember.
How could I forget?

09:55.360 --> 09:58.227
- Excuse me?
- Uh, there's a problem
with your application,

09:58.296 --> 10:00.730
- as I recall, Miss...
- Pfeiffer.

10:00.799 --> 10:04.235
- Are you sure?
- Lulu Pfeiffer, yes.

10:04.302 --> 10:07.203
You reside at
15527 Morton Bay Street?

10:07.272 --> 10:10.537
- Not any longer. I've moved.
- You've moved?

10:10.609 --> 10:12.839
Yes. And I don't have
my new address yet.

10:12.911 --> 10:15.744
Actually, Miss Pfeiffer,
that's what's sending up the red flag.

10:15.814 --> 10:19.375
You move a lot. And there's also
your employment history.

10:19.451 --> 10:23.080
Seventeen jobs in seventeen states
in the past three years?

10:23.154 --> 10:25.850
You seem to have as many jobs here
as you have addresses.

10:25.924 --> 10:27.983
L... I had
a restless streak.

10:28.059 --> 10:30.755
Well, the copy business
takes a motivated person.

10:30.829 --> 10:35.095
Oh, I'm an extremely versatile employee,
as you can see by my resume.

10:35.166 --> 10:38.260
What I can tell is you've
left a variety of jobs.

10:38.336 --> 10:41.737
"Mongolian barbecue chef,
high-rise window washer,

10:41.806 --> 10:44.775
- wild animal trainer, palm reader."
- [Machines Whirring Loudly]

10:44.843 --> 10:47.577
- Yes, but I am on a career path now.
- Hey! What's going on here?

10:47.577 --> 10:48.908
- Yes, but I am on a career path now.
- Hey! What's going on here?

10:48.978 --> 10:52.345
- All my copies are black.
- My machine's going crazy.

10:52.415 --> 10:54.406
Who's running
this place?

10:54.483 --> 10:57.850
I can start you immediately. There's a
clean uniform in the employee washroom.

10:57.920 --> 11:01.754
- Oh, God.
- Here. Over here. Oh, that's great.

11:01.824 --> 11:04.691
- Can you help me turn this thing off?
- [Whirring Continues]

11:04.760 --> 11:07.194
[Man]
My only copy!

11:19.942 --> 11:25.380
That's quite a string of positions
you've had, Miss... Templeton.

11:25.448 --> 11:28.008
Seventeen jobs
in the last three years.

11:28.084 --> 11:31.383
I would've listed more, but there
wasn't any room left on your form.

11:31.454 --> 11:33.445
Seventeen's plenty,
believe me.

11:33.522 --> 11:37.185
I think you'll find my former
employees will only give the
highest personal references...

11:37.259 --> 11:41.161
It's not your references.
It's the jobs themselves.

11:41.230 --> 11:45.633
"Mongolian barbecue chef,
high-rise window washer.

11:45.701 --> 11:47.635
Wild animal trainer?"

11:47.703 --> 11:49.796
I'm a highly versatile employee.

11:49.872 --> 11:51.931
[Scoffs]

11:52.008 --> 11:55.409
What guarantee do I have that you
won't just up and quit tomorrow?

11:55.478 --> 11:59.244
You have my personal word on it.
I'm here in Kansas City to stay.

12:23.506 --> 12:25.906
- [Knocking]
- Who is it?

12:25.975 --> 12:28.739
[Mulder]
Mr. Zupanic, it's the F.B.I.

12:28.811 --> 12:31.575
- Excuse me?
- It's the F.B.I., Mr. Zupanic.

12:31.647 --> 12:34.138
- Open up.
- Give me a minute.

12:39.255 --> 12:41.655
- Bert Zupanic?
- Yeah?

12:41.724 --> 12:43.817
We're hoping you could help us
find the whereabouts...

12:43.893 --> 12:45.827
of a woman we think
you're familiar with...

12:45.895 --> 12:48.489
a Betty Templeton.

12:48.564 --> 12:50.691
I don't know
no Betty Templeton.

12:50.766 --> 12:54.202
Maybe you should take another look
at that photograph, Mr. Zupanic.

12:55.271 --> 12:57.535
Five foot three,
red hair.

12:58.708 --> 13:00.642
Maybe I can
jog your memory.

13:06.749 --> 13:09.650
Are you still pleading
ignorance, Mr. Zupanic?

13:09.719 --> 13:13.246
Is that not you in last year's
Fourth ofJuly parade?

13:13.322 --> 13:15.984
- Yeah.
- Then who's that sitting next to you?

13:16.058 --> 13:18.891
- Her.
- Try Betty Templeton.

13:20.596 --> 13:24.225
We can't find her, Mr. Zupanic.
She seems to have left town in a hurry.

13:24.300 --> 13:26.495
- She did?
- Mm-hmm.

13:26.569 --> 13:31.438
And didn't she used to live
on Morton Bay in a pink house?

13:32.975 --> 13:36.877
- Alderwood, blue house.
- On Alderwood?

13:36.946 --> 13:40.040
Mr. Zupanic, do you have
any reason to be lying to us?

13:40.116 --> 13:42.175
No, sir...
I mean, ma'am.

13:42.251 --> 13:45.880
Thank you, Mr. Zupanic. I have no doubt
we'll be in touch with you.

13:50.359 --> 13:53.817
- You know what I'm thinking.
- That Mr. Zupanic not only
knows Betty Templeton...

13:53.896 --> 13:57.764
and where we can find her, but that
he is hip to whatever she's into,

13:57.833 --> 14:00.199
and I should take a look at that house
he mentioned on Morton Bay Street...

14:00.269 --> 14:03.500
while you go and find out
from Mr. Zupanic what it is exactly...

14:03.572 --> 14:05.802
that he's clearly hiding
about Betty Templeton.

14:05.875 --> 14:10.039
I'm thinking that Bert Zupanic really
truly doesn't know Betty Templeton.

14:13.916 --> 14:17.579
Well, I guess that's why
they put the "l" in the F.B.I.

and make it stiff.

15:52.014 --> 15:55.313
Oh, my God!
How did you do that?

- How did you know my drink?

like you're reading
my soul like a book.

16:12.301 --> 16:15.361
Maybe you've had enough
of the vodka.

16:15.437 --> 16:19.703
- You are in trouble, aren't you?
- I don't know.

16:19.775 --> 16:22.005
I could be.

16:22.077 --> 16:24.011
What kind of trouble
are you looking for?

16:24.079 --> 16:26.775
You don't want to go home
tonight, okay?

16:26.849 --> 16:29.875
It just so happens
I don't got a home to go to.

Hey, Scully!

17:51.564 --> 17:55.591
I want you to meet a buddy of mine,
Mr. Argyle "Sapersteen."

17:55.668 --> 17:59.001
- "Stein."
- Saperstein. Excuse me.

17:59.071 --> 18:01.972
- [Hebrew]
- This is my partner, Dana Scully.

18:02.041 --> 18:04.407
Pleasure and an honor.

18:04.477 --> 18:08.971
So, uh, I take it from your posture,
Mulder, you've solved this case.

18:09.048 --> 18:11.812
Not solved it, but I have narrowed
down the search for our perpetrator...

18:11.884 --> 18:13.818
with the kind help
of Mr. Saperstein here.

18:13.886 --> 18:17.287
- Narrowed it down to where?
- Right down there.

18:19.625 --> 18:22.560
Our mystery woman is indeed
involved with Mr. Bert Zupanic,

18:22.628 --> 18:24.562
the man we spoke to
at his hotel,

18:24.630 --> 18:28.930
who will be fighting here
two days hence with the mystery
woman undoubtedly in attendance.

If it's the lady I'm thinking,
she's not much to look at,

18:31.637 --> 18:33.571
but he says
she brings him luck.

18:33.639 --> 18:37.336
- Bert Zupanic is a boxer?
- A wrestler, semipro.

18:37.410 --> 18:42.347
So, we wait around Kansas City
for a couple of days until
we can talk to this woman?

18:42.415 --> 18:45.316
Well, there's lots to do here
and the barbecue's second to none.

18:45.384 --> 18:48.148
Right, Mr. Saperstein? Plus,
Mr. Saperstein was gonna show me...

18:48.220 --> 18:52.213
some in-your-face smack down
moves so I can quit getting
my ass kicked so often, right?

18:52.291 --> 18:57.319
Oh, and there's... there's
an art exhibit that traces
the influence of Soviet art...

18:57.396 --> 19:00.763
on the American
pop culture, right?

19:00.833 --> 19:04.030
Unless, of course,
you've already found Betty Templeton.

19:04.103 --> 19:06.765
Finding Betty Templeton
won't solve this case, Mulder.

19:06.839 --> 19:08.932
Not unless
we find Lulu Pfeiffer.

19:09.008 --> 19:11.738
- Who's Lulu Pfeiffer?
- Our doppelganger...

19:11.811 --> 19:16.145
who lived, until yesterday,
in a pink house on Morton Bay Street.

19:16.215 --> 19:18.877
But she's not a manifestation,
Mulder. She's real...

19:18.951 --> 19:21.886
and so is the path of destruction
that she's left in her wake.

19:21.954 --> 19:24.923
Though there seems to be no connection
of any kind between these two women,

19:24.990 --> 19:26.924
Betty Templeton
and Lulu Pfeiffer...

19:26.992 --> 19:30.553
have traveled city to city
across 17 U.S. States,

19:30.629 --> 19:34.497
one alternately trailing
the other for the past 12 years.

19:34.567 --> 19:39.266
- And wherever they have been,
mayhem has followed.
- Damn.

19:39.338 --> 19:42.865
It's not just car accidents
and fistfights, Mulder.

19:42.942 --> 19:48.209
- It's house fires
and explosions and even riots.
- The lady knows her stuff.

I got it,
and I'm bringing it.

20:16.075 --> 20:19.806
Yeah, that's what I heard last night.
Now you got the feds on your ass.

- What?
- Your good luck charm
don't sound so lucky no more.

20:23.916 --> 20:25.907
Maybe I should cancel
the fight.

I'm bringing the money, okay?
I'm bringing it!

20:28.754 --> 20:33.623

I gotta be somewhere,
okay?

20:43.135 --> 20:46.298
Why? What time is it?
Oh, God, I'm gonna be late for work!

20:51.644 --> 20:54.374
You were incredible.

20:54.446 --> 20:58.576

to you, Bert Zupanic?

21:30.749 --> 21:32.979
I was there,
and l-I was waiting on you.

- How can you say that?
You're my good luck charm.

- Who is she?
- "Who is she?"

with me, mister!

This is mine.

- I forgive you.

go to work. You're late.
- No. No.

to you, Bert Zupanic.
- Hey, listen.

What's not to love, all right?
- There's a lot to love.

- I know. You go on.
No! You have to go.

- Follows her wherever she goes.
- Lulu Pfeiffer works at Koko's too.

35:51.874 --> 35:54.968
is he's probably the angriest
man in the world, Mulder.

35:55.044 --> 35:57.444
Not as angry as those
two women are gonna be...

35:57.513 --> 36:01.005
when they both realize they're in love
with the one and only Bert Zupanic.

36:01.083 --> 36:03.051
- They're both after him?
- They're both in love with him.

36:03.118 --> 36:05.848
That's why they're both staying
in Kansas City and they won't leave.

36:05.921 --> 36:09.288
Well, if they're the reason,
it doesn't explain what's happening,

36:09.358 --> 36:12.623
what's causing this phenomenon
or how we're gonna make it stop.

36:12.695 --> 36:15.459
I don't know. You're the one who's
supposed to have all the answers.

36:15.531 --> 36:18.659
Somebody's got to get to that fight
and keep those two women apart,

36:18.734 --> 36:22.363
or else this time the...
[Static] is going to hit the fans.

36:22.438 --> 36:24.372
[Man]
Well, hi.

36:28.410 --> 36:30.674
Mr. Zupanic?

36:38.553 --> 36:41.989
- [Crowd Cheering]
- # Goin'to Kansas City #

36:42.056 --> 36:44.456
#Kansas City, here I come #

36:44.525 --> 36:47.323
[Shouting]

36:47.395 --> 36:50.330
# Goin'to Kansas City #

36:50.398 --> 36:52.593
#Kansas City, here I come ##

36:52.667 --> 36:54.794
- ##[Continues]
- You said you'd have my money.

36:54.869 --> 36:56.894
I'll have it.
I swear I will.

36:56.971 --> 36:59.462
I'll call off
the damn fight, Titanic.

36:59.540 --> 37:01.940
I'll have these people
cursing your very name!

37:02.009 --> 37:04.477
I'm telling you
it'll be here.

37:04.545 --> 37:06.775
Don't worry.
I promise.

37:06.848 --> 37:09.180
Bert!

37:11.118 --> 37:13.450
Bert, I got it.

37:21.395 --> 37:23.761
How about ya, buddy?

37:26.133 --> 37:28.067
Let's get ready
to rumble.

37:32.373 --> 37:35.433
Oh, baby, I knew you
wouldn't let me down.

37:35.509 --> 37:38.171
It's you and me...
all the way.

37:42.450 --> 37:44.384
[Bell Dinging]

37:44.452 --> 37:47.683
- [Crowd Booing]
- Yeah!

37:48.823 --> 37:51.917
- [Bell Dinging]
- [Growls, Shouts]

37:54.228 --> 37:56.924
- [Bell Dinging]
- [Shouting]

37:58.266 --> 38:00.200
Ladies and gentlemen,

38:00.268 --> 38:03.237
get out your seats
and on your feets...

38:03.304 --> 38:05.238
for our own hometown boy,

38:05.306 --> 38:07.433
Whoo!

38:07.508 --> 38:11.069
Bert "the Titanic"...

38:11.145 --> 38:14.706
Zupanic!

38:14.782 --> 38:16.909
[Cheering]

38:16.984 --> 38:20.920
- Go, Titanic!
- Oh! Oh, yeah!

38:20.988 --> 38:25.220
Let's take him, baby!
Let's take him, baby!

38:25.293 --> 38:27.284
Whoo!

38:30.197 --> 38:32.131
[Grunting]

38:32.199 --> 38:34.133
[No Audible Dialogue]

38:38.105 --> 38:40.039
- Whoo!
- [Bell Dings]

38:40.107 --> 38:42.905
[Man Whistling]

38:42.977 --> 38:46.435
[Grunting]

38:46.514 --> 38:48.448
Come on!

39:03.230 --> 39:05.164
- [Man] Titanic!
- [Groaning]

39:05.232 --> 39:07.598
- [Shouting]
- [Groans]

39:09.971 --> 39:12.439
[Shouting]

39:12.506 --> 39:14.440
Oh, yeah! Come on!

39:18.079 --> 39:21.242
Whoo-hoo!
Go, Titanic!

39:25.720 --> 39:27.745
You can do it, Titanic!

39:28.923 --> 39:31.289
Betty Templeton.

39:31.359 --> 39:34.351
My name is Fox Mulder. I'm with
the F.B.I. Can you come with me?

39:34.428 --> 39:37.124
I'm watching the fight!

39:37.198 --> 39:39.666
Don't make me have to
remove you, ma'am.

39:42.436 --> 39:44.529
I can't believe this.

39:45.873 --> 39:47.807
What are you doing here?

39:47.875 --> 39:51.367
What are you doing here?
I'm Bert's good luck.

39:51.445 --> 39:56.781
- He's mine!
- Over my dead body!

39:59.887 --> 40:03.186
Stop it! Stop it!
You're going down, lady!

40:03.257 --> 40:05.555
I'm gonna kick your butt
from here till Tuesday!

40:05.626 --> 40:09.653
Stick a fork in you!
You're done! Hi, baby.

40:11.498 --> 40:15.161
- Betty?
- Bert, keep it up. I love you, baby!

40:15.235 --> 40:18.068
- Bert, I got the money.
- Lulu?

40:18.138 --> 40:20.538
Kick his butt, Bert.

40:25.545 --> 40:28.036
[Screaming, Shouting]

40:28.115 --> 40:30.208
- [Bert] Lulu!
- [Screams]

40:30.283 --> 40:32.148
No! Bert!

40:34.821 --> 40:36.812
[Shouting Continues]

41:05.085 --> 41:07.019
Oh, my.

41:09.689 --> 41:12.283
Oh, my God!

41:21.368 --> 41:23.302
What?

41:27.107 --> 41:29.769
Why...

41:29.843 --> 41:34.280
- [Shouting]
- [Shouting]

42:04.711 --> 42:06.645
[Scully]
Fifty million anonymous donations...

42:06.713 --> 42:08.647
have been made to sperm banks
across the U.S.

42:08.715 --> 42:11.707
Most have produced healthy offspring
for single mothers...

42:11.785 --> 42:16.984
or fertility-challenged couples
while some of them have not.

42:17.057 --> 42:20.493
Bert Zupanic and his nonfraternal
biological sibling...

42:20.560 --> 42:24.257
both small-time bank robbers,
part-time pro wrestlers,

42:24.331 --> 42:28.062
both with too many idiosyncratic
behaviorisms to list...

42:28.134 --> 42:31.592
stood a 27-million-to-one chance
of ever meeting,

42:31.671 --> 42:34.367
but they did.

42:34.441 --> 42:37.103
[Argyle]
Damn, those are some odds.

42:37.177 --> 42:39.111
[Scully]
Betty Templeton and Lulu Pfeiffer...

42:39.179 --> 42:41.477
products of different mothers
but the same father,

42:41.548 --> 42:44.517
an angry drifter now doing time
for counterfeiting...

42:44.584 --> 42:46.609
chanced to meet 12 years ago,

42:46.686 --> 42:51.214
but couldn't seem to avoid each other's
compulsively identical mannerisms...

42:51.291 --> 42:55.057
mannerisms attributable to
their perpetually angry father.

42:56.630 --> 42:59.394
Hmm. What does it
all mean?

42:59.466 --> 43:02.162
[Scully] I've been thinking hard
about that, Mr. Saperstein.

43:02.235 --> 43:05.398
I would like to say it has something
to do with balance in the universe...

43:05.472 --> 43:09.067
the attraction of opposites
and the repulsion of equivalents.

43:09.142 --> 43:12.839
Or, that over time, nature produces
only so many originals...

43:12.913 --> 43:17.850
that when two original copies meet,
that the result is often unpredictable.

43:17.918 --> 43:21.319
If four should meet,
the result is...

43:21.388 --> 43:23.856
Well, suffice to say,

43:23.924 --> 43:27.519
it's betterjust to avoid
these encounters altogether...

43:27.594 --> 43:29.994
and at all costs.

43:31.131 --> 43:33.691
I think Agent Mulder
would agree with me.

43:33.767 --> 43:37.601
Uh-huh.
[Moans]

44:20.379 --> 44:23.075
[Child]
I made this!
