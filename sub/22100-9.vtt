The Threes. The D'Annas.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.779
They were boxed after the
battle on the Algae Planet.

ADAMA: Why?

00:31.073 --> 00:33.032
NATALIE: D'Anna saw the
faces of the Final Five.

00:33.117 --> 00:36.035
But if we unbox her, she can
reveal their identities to us.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.037
STARBUCK: The Final
Five have been to Earth.

00:38.122 --> 00:40.206
If we help find them,
they can help us get there.

ROSLIN: What could possibly
motivate us to trust you now?

00:42.835 --> 00:47.046
The boxing facility resides
within the Cylon Resurrection hub.

00:47.131 --> 00:50.216
This hub controls the functions
of every Resurrection ship.

00:50.300 --> 00:54.470
You destroy the hub, Cylons
lose their ability to download.

00:56.640 --> 01:01.227
The Hybrid on the Baseship spoke of
an opera house and a dying leader.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.187
We're going to talk
to the Hybrid.

01:03.272 --> 01:05.565
And why would you
require my presence?

01:05.649 --> 01:07.734
Because you're in my visions.

01:07.818 --> 01:11.070
ZAREK: President Roslin was
apparently aboard the Cylon Baseship,

01:11.155 --> 01:14.115
along with Gaius Baltar
and many of Galactica's pilots

01:14.199 --> 01:15.241
when it jumped away.

01:15.325 --> 01:16.367
Hub's gone.

01:16.452 --> 01:19.245
We're getting radiation
signatures from multiple nukes.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.788
Baseship fragments.

01:20.873 --> 01:23.416
The President's Baseship
was destroyed.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.084
It's a different Baseship.

while the rest of the Fleet jumps away,

01:28.464 --> 01:30.715

a lot like suicide, Dad.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.258
Why are you doing this?

01:32.342 --> 01:34.677
ADAMA: Because I can't live without her.

02:00.662 --> 02:03.080
Plug it in.
I need to talk to it.

Find out why.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.524
She can just do that.
She can just...

03:11.608 --> 03:12.650

It's empty.
It is.

03:31.962 --> 03:34.338
Feels bigger this way, doesn't it?

03:37.634 --> 03:39.051
It's so quiet.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.720
It's strange.

in the stream.

04:51.208 --> 04:54.043
That's unusual to jump again so quickly.

04:55.712 --> 04:56.712
What do you
think it means?

04:56.797 --> 04:58.339
Look, it knows me.

04:58.423 --> 04:59.924
It trusts me.

I think...

05:02.094 --> 05:05.221
I think it even
likes me, 'cause I...

05:05.305 --> 05:08.224
You're getting information
from this liquid?

05:09.851 --> 05:13.354
The Hybrid is disorganized.
It's panicking. I don't know why.

05:13.438 --> 05:16.774
Tell me. Why are you
jumping the ship?

05:16.858 --> 05:18.234
The Six.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.529
The Six who went among
the makers is no longer.

She's either been hurt
or killed back on Galactica.

05:34.793 --> 05:37.003
That's why
the Hybrid's panicking.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.587
So she's upset.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.339
Okay, fine.

05:40.424 --> 05:44.135
Can you calm her down? Can
you tell her to jump back?

05:44.219 --> 05:45.720
It doesn't work like that.

05:45.804 --> 05:47.972
She makes
her own decisions.

05:48.557 --> 05:52.018
And we can't unplug her because now
she's wired herself into life support.

don't we give this a go?

But you don't
love them, either.

06:46.782 --> 06:51.243
The people in this room are the closest
thing you've got to family, and you,

06:51.328 --> 06:53.496
you've been their president.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.003
Watch them try
to comfort each other.

07:02.130 --> 07:05.466
At least you haven't taken
that away from them, yet.

07:06.343 --> 07:09.345
You didn't rob them
of their empathy, yet.

07:11.014 --> 07:13.933
You just don't make room
for people anymore.

07:14.851 --> 07:17.520
You don't love people.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.107

07:21.191 --> 07:24.026
Practical enough for
you, Madam President?

07:36.164 --> 07:39.375
I think we're going towards
the Resurrection hub.

07:41.002 --> 07:43.379
I think the mission
is still on.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.926
You sure there's
no ETA at the hub?

07:49.010 --> 07:51.971
No, the hub is jumping and
our Hybrid's jumping after it.

07:52.055 --> 07:54.265
Sometimes we're showing up
six hours after it's moved on.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.517
Sometimes, like,
six minutes.

07:56.601 --> 07:59.103
And one time it'll be within one
jump-length and we'll catch it.

07:59.187 --> 08:00.521
Yeah, but we
don't know when.

08:00.605 --> 08:04.859
So we'll have to assume that any jump could
be the one that just drops us in next to it.

08:07.821 --> 08:12.241
They're gonna read our heat signatures
the second we fire up the first Viper.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.827
Hell, they'll read
our electronics.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.788
Yeah, if we could
only mask that.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.834
Go in cold.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.794
No electronics at all.

08:25.255 --> 08:29.842
We'll send the Vipers out
dead, towed by Cylon birds.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.051
They'll never see it coming.

08:31.136 --> 08:35.181
Take out the hub's jump drive,
then settle in for the long fight.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.391
Yeah, good, okay, okay.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.018
But you and me, we've
got to get onto the hub

08:39.102 --> 08:42.271

and try to find D'Anna.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.527

right where the action is.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.827
It's not a great plan.

08:56.912 --> 08:58.454
There's no time.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.002
Hey, let me help you.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.980
Athena, my wife,
she learned to do that.

09:25.982 --> 09:28.400
She never did that
when I met her.

09:33.657 --> 09:34.823
What?

09:36.159 --> 09:40.037
I got curious about Athena,
about her and Hera and you.

09:41.998 --> 09:45.960
So I accessed her, her
memories from her last download.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.005
You have her memories.

09:51.174 --> 09:54.176
Yeah, and they're
mine now, too.

09:56.221 --> 09:58.514

violation of trust or something,

10:01.393 --> 10:05.896

to be strange, okay?

10:07.065 --> 10:08.232
Right.

10:09.693 --> 10:11.360
Right, sure.

10:47.105 --> 10:51.191
Don't worry. I'll give it back to
Lt. Pike the second you need it.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.235
About that.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.530
This mission,
it's very risky.

10:57.449 --> 11:00.826
If there's even a chance
that we can go in and blow up

11:00.910 --> 11:06.290
that hub and end Cylon
resurrection for all Cylons forever,

11:06.374 --> 11:08.250
we must take it.

11:08.877 --> 11:11.086
I cannot back
away from that.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.839
Yes, sir.

If and when D'Anna comes back
from the dead, bring her to me.

I think the Cylons think that she'll
be interrogated by both groups together.

11:27.979 --> 11:30.439
I'm sure they do.
Bring her to me.

11:32.776 --> 11:36.862

the five Cylons in our fleet.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.323
It is a matter now
of human security,

11:39.407 --> 11:44.203

have audience to that discussion.

11:44.287 --> 11:46.455

to her alone.

Boomer's my pet Eight.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.449
She's seen
the light of reason.

13:03.533 --> 13:07.619
And an Eight can
make a passionate ally.

13:07.704 --> 13:10.372

something shiny.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.794
Why'd you bring me
back anyway?

Sister, and end this shameful war.

don't use call signs,

13:34.272 --> 13:37.566

all tied together here,

speak, and they tap on the brakes,

14:26.950 --> 14:28.700
they're gonna smash right
in the back.

14:28.785 --> 14:31.411
They won't. It'll work,
you guys. Really.

14:31.496 --> 14:34.206
When you're close enough,
the cable's gonna disconnect.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.083

14:41.214 --> 14:43.840
Then you sling out of their
birds and you turn your power on.

up, and then we're toast, right?

and she hasn't betrayed you.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.572
Well, I am the same as her.

Now all of these Cylons here, all of
these people, they're pilots like you,

15:14.163 --> 15:18.083
and they're gonna be out in the soup
with you taking out other Cylons,

15:18.167 --> 15:21.336
just like Athena does
every time she's asked to.

15:23.715 --> 15:29.094
And when that hub is taken out,
all of their lives will be at risk,

15:29.846 --> 15:31.305
just like yours.

15:31.389 --> 15:35.100
So you might want to think about
how you're gonna work together,

15:35.184 --> 15:37.686
because we're all
dead if you don't.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.026
HELO: Moving on.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.320
BALTAR: Just go
and ask it already.

15:46.988 --> 15:49.823
I've been told that you said
something about an opera house,

15:49.907 --> 15:51.658
and I... Because
it seems pointless.

15:51.743 --> 15:54.202
Look, there was an opera
house, an opera house.

15:54.287 --> 15:57.372
Are you listening to me?
Apparently, I was in the opera house.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.375
I had a vision. I was
chasing after a little girl.

16:00.460 --> 16:06.131
I came to a door. I saw Dr.
Baltar and the Six take the child.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.550
...close the doors. Protect
the child. She's not listening.

16:08.635 --> 16:09.968
"Protect the child. "
HYBRID: Protect the child.

16:10.053 --> 16:12.137
She said, "Protect the child. "
That's what Caprica said.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.139
You told me I was
the one holding the child,

16:14.223 --> 16:16.892
so obviously I was the one
protecting the child, wasn't I?

16:16.976 --> 16:18.560
In the opera house...
No, no, no.

16:18.645 --> 16:21.521
It wasn't at all clear what you were
doing in the vision. Let me listen.

16:21.606 --> 16:22.981
Booting up.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.318
I mean, obviously you've
done this 1,000 times before.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.111
I'm just doing the
same thing you're doing.

16:28.196 --> 16:31.239
No, you're not, actually. No, you're not.
Because if you'll watch what I'm doing,

16:31.324 --> 16:34.534
what I'm doing is I'm actually
focusing on her, all right?

16:34.619 --> 16:37.287
(SHOUTING) Now tell us what happened
in the opera house now, all right?

16:37.372 --> 16:39.748
The only thing
you're doing is yelling.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.249
Such a format will
close the doors.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.585
"Close the doors. " No, no,
open the door. Open the door.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.421
I want to open the door! Do it
again, do it again, do it again!

16:46.506 --> 16:48.882
I'm going for a walk.
Love to see you do any better.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.801
All right, I'll do it.
Open the door!

16:50.885 --> 16:52.386
Three!

16:52.470 --> 16:54.721
The Three is online.
The Three is online.

16:54.806 --> 16:56.264
"The Three is online.
The Three is online. "

16:56.349 --> 16:57.599
HYBRID: Accessing data.
The Three is D'Anna.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.518
HYBRID: Loading data.
D'Anna is online.

16:59.602 --> 17:02.020
D'Anna's in a body.
D'Anna's back in a body.

17:02.105 --> 17:03.730
Booting up. Jump!

17:16.452 --> 17:18.453
ROSLIN: Why are
we doing this again?

17:18.538 --> 17:21.039
I don't want to
see this again.

17:21.124 --> 17:26.044
The ancients used to say, "A people is
only as strong as the body of its leader. "

17:26.129 --> 17:33.093
If I follow that thought, are you
saying that humanity died because I died?

17:33.177 --> 17:38.724
If you're my subconscious, I've gotta
say you're a little full of myself.

17:38.808 --> 17:41.643
Humanity didn't die
because you did.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.729
The ancients, they got
a lot of things wrong.

17:43.813 --> 17:46.690
The body of a people is not the
same as the body of its leader,

17:46.774 --> 17:48.775
but the soul and
the spirit might be.

17:48.860 --> 17:51.653
I see, so you're only
laying morality at my feet.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.572
Well, that's okay.
I can take that.

17:53.656 --> 17:56.992
I mean, there are a lot of people
who have sins far greater than mine.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.411
You're thinking
of Gaius Baltar.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.456
ADAMA: "... then I dug into the stump

18:02.540 --> 18:05.500
"and pulled rocks from the
ground until my fingers bled.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.962
"I collected seeds from the
few fruits the island offered,

18:09.046 --> 18:14.092
"and planted them in long, straight
furrows, like the ranks of soldiers.

18:14.177 --> 18:16.219
"When I finished,
I looked at what I had done.

18:16.304 --> 18:19.431
"I did not see a garden.
I saw a scar.

18:19.515 --> 18:23.935
"This island had saved my life,
and I had done it no service. "

18:42.038 --> 18:44.706
I can see a real
hierarchy around here.

18:44.791 --> 18:48.960
And I have to tell you, you're on
the lower end of the scale, my friend.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.545
Yes, you are.

18:52.256 --> 18:55.467
Which is odd when you
think about the Cylon God...

18:59.180 --> 19:01.807
They told you about God, didn't they?

19:04.143 --> 19:10.190
I'm not even really sure if the Hybrid was
referring to D'Anna, but if it's true...

19:10.274 --> 19:11.942
It certainly would
make it easier.

19:12.026 --> 19:13.318
How so?

19:14.278 --> 19:17.322
Well, we wouldn't
have to find a...

19:18.407 --> 19:20.200
Find a body.

19:20.284 --> 19:23.161
Yes, good. Okay.

19:23.246 --> 19:25.497
Go get her and
bring her here.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.082
(COUGHS)

19:30.419 --> 19:31.920
Something else?

19:35.258 --> 19:38.051
It's just once you have what she knows,

19:38.135 --> 19:40.679
I can't help feeling like you could
try to keep Earth for humans only.

19:40.763 --> 19:44.516
And I just... Madam
President, that doesn't seem...

19:44.600 --> 19:45.767
What?

19:46.727 --> 19:48.353
Honest.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.522
You're supposed to be
conducting a fair deal here,

19:50.606 --> 19:52.691
and instead you're taking
D'Anna off by yourself.

19:52.775 --> 19:53.900
Taking what she knows.

19:53.985 --> 19:55.318
Slow down, Captain.

19:55.403 --> 20:00.365
At best, D'Anna knows the identities
of the Cylons in our fleet.

20:00.449 --> 20:03.952
And at best, they know a way to Earth.

20:05.663 --> 20:09.708
So you're not denying you'd keep the
way to Earth to yourself if you could.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.751
I'm not saying that's true.

20:11.836 --> 20:14.379
I will say that if the
Cylons had the option,

20:14.463 --> 20:17.465
that's exactly, exactly
what they would do.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.888
No, I don't think so.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.932
Not the Sharons,
the Eights.

20:27.268 --> 20:28.643
Captain,

20:29.437 --> 20:33.523
you are not married to
the entire production line.

20:33.608 --> 20:37.277
I cannot afford to be
sentimental right now,

20:37.361 --> 20:40.363
and I cannot afford you
to be sentimental, either.

20:40.448 --> 20:44.534
If you can't do this job,
find me someone who can.

20:45.161 --> 20:46.912
(ALARM BLARING)

20:46.996 --> 20:48.663
What is that?

20:52.043 --> 20:53.835
I think we're there.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.302
Something's going on.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.679
Another Baseship,
unscheduled.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.890
CAVIL: You've gotta speak to
the Twos and Sixes and Eights

21:06.974 --> 21:09.768
and tell them
they've gone too far.

21:09.852 --> 21:10.977
No.

21:11.062 --> 21:14.105
Why don't you ask
about the Final Five?

21:14.190 --> 21:15.732
You never ask about them.

21:15.816 --> 21:18.360
That's because I don't believe
we're meant to know them.

21:18.444 --> 21:23.406
Well, I'll tell you. I will tell you.
I'll start shouting out their names.

21:24.367 --> 21:25.909
Why do you risk it?

21:25.993 --> 21:29.079
Are you going to help end
this war or are you useless?

21:29.163 --> 21:33.541
Twenty-five Heavy Raiders just launched
from the new arrival, heading our way.

21:38.089 --> 21:41.132
Come on, let's get
this carpool started.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.272
Now!

21:56.357 --> 21:59.526
Cut the frakking cable now,
you frakking bastard!

22:14.583 --> 22:17.544
The inhibition's been lifted.

22:18.754 --> 22:19.838
I sense it.

22:19.922 --> 22:22.007
BOOMER: It's
the rebel Baseship.

22:22.091 --> 22:25.760
I think they're gonna attack.
They're gonna blow the hub.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.887
That would be mass murder.

22:28.848 --> 22:32.600
Death would be permanent for
all of us. They've gone insane.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.310
Permanent death?

22:35.438 --> 22:38.440
Well, that makes this
all the more meaningful.

23:04.508 --> 23:07.427
REDWING: Helo, we've blown their
FTL. That hub's not going anywhere.

23:07.511 --> 23:09.304
Okay, take us down.

23:21.192 --> 23:23.359
Well, he's your God, as well.

23:23.444 --> 23:27.781
And God doesn't want any of
his creations to be slaves.

23:31.452 --> 23:34.996
Not that you're
a slave, exactly.

There was this dog, see, and the

25:34.533 --> 25:36.910
on the edge
of its snout.

25:36.994 --> 25:40.622
And the dog had to wait until
he was told he could eat it.

You have this...

You have this big hole in
your hide, as Cottle would say.

27:35.738 --> 27:39.324
Okay. All right. You
can put your hand there.

27:39.408 --> 27:41.784
I'm gonna do this again.
Thank you.

27:41.869 --> 27:43.828
It's the least I can do.

I think you're gonna
live, as usual.

28:00.971 --> 28:02.847
Do you know why I'm
so serene right now?

28:02.931 --> 28:05.141
You're doped
out of your mind?

28:05.684 --> 28:07.435
Because I know God.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.937
You need God, Laura.

28:10.773 --> 28:13.107
Really, you'd be
a different woman.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.567
I know God.

28:15.569 --> 28:17.570
Therefore, I know myself.

28:19.239 --> 28:20.656
Truth is,

28:22.910 --> 28:26.412
I was harboring the most
awful, desperate guilt.

28:28.123 --> 28:30.208
A heavy, dark,

28:31.293 --> 28:32.794
unimaginable,

28:33.337 --> 28:35.296
soul-breaking guilt.

28:42.012 --> 28:43.554
Now it's gone.

28:43.972 --> 28:47.725
Now it's gone.
It's been transformed into...

28:49.436 --> 28:51.437
I have been transformed.

28:52.815 --> 28:54.816

your guilt about?

28:55.859 --> 28:57.527
I have no guilt.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.114
What was your guilt about?

29:08.789 --> 29:11.374
I gave the access
codes to the Cylons.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.710
They wiped out
most of humanity.

29:20.384 --> 29:22.927
Of course, I didn't know that's
what I was doing at the time exactly,

29:23.011 --> 29:24.512
but that's what I did.

29:24.596 --> 29:28.975
And when I realized what
I had done, the magnitude,

29:31.019 --> 29:33.146
in that moment,
I was saved.

29:34.982 --> 29:38.234
I was loved by God.

29:39.695 --> 29:41.195
Looking back,

29:42.531 --> 29:44.532
I think I was rewarded.

Rewarded.

Pythia talks about the flood

Yes, that's right.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.051
And it's
a good thing, D'Anna,

32:50.385 --> 32:52.803
because now there's
no difference.

32:54.890 --> 32:57.475
We can all start
trusting each other.

Don't do this to me.

Don't do this
to me, please.

33:24.878 --> 33:25.836
Please.

33:25.921 --> 33:27.338
(WHISPERS) No.

33:32.678 --> 33:36.097
I'm not saying Baltar's done more
good than harm in the universe.

33:36.181 --> 33:37.306
He hasn't.

33:37.391 --> 33:41.727
The thing is, the harder it is to
recognize someone's right to draw breath,

33:41.812 --> 33:43.729
the more crucial it is.

33:44.439 --> 33:47.525
If humanity is going to prove
itself worthy of surviving,

33:47.609 --> 33:50.736
it can't do it on
a case-by-case basis.

33:52.531 --> 33:55.991
A bad man feels his death
just as keenly as a good man.

want from me here?

34:02.499 --> 34:04.250
Just love someone.

You go.

You go to
your rest now.

34:42.289 --> 34:44.665
I'm not gonna be
selfish anymore.

34:47.961 --> 34:49.211
You go.

get D'Anna to the control room.

No, that's
not the plan.

What plan?

36:09.918 --> 36:11.377
Interesting.

(SNIFFLING) I don't know
how... All right, put it in.

36:25.851 --> 36:28.352
I have to take her directly
to the President. No one else.

36:28.436 --> 36:29.520
No, that wasn't the deal.

36:29.604 --> 36:32.815
I'm just doing what
she told me to do, okay?

36:34.109 --> 36:35.609
Double dealing.

36:36.111 --> 36:38.946
It's very human. You
never got that, Eight.

I'm not saying I agree.
I'm saying it's my orders.

37:09.477 --> 37:13.230
So I pretty much just made a
prize fool of myself, didn't I?

37:17.235 --> 37:18.527
Trust.

37:18.612 --> 37:20.988
D'ANNA: Can we go
find the President now?

37:41.468 --> 37:42.718
Gaius?

37:50.644 --> 37:52.186
Gaius, it's me.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.150
The hub's been destroyed.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.110
Good.

He's injured, but I think
he's going to survive.

I think it's gonna be
a long time jumping back.

Well, you went to a lot of
trouble to bring me here,

38:32.102 --> 38:34.478
deceiving your
so-called allies.

38:38.441 --> 38:40.943
I suppose you've got
some questions for me.

38:41.027 --> 38:42.319
Yes, I do.

38:42.404 --> 38:46.115
I'd like to talk about
the five Cylons in my fleet.

38:47.575 --> 38:50.411
So you know about
the Final Five.

38:50.495 --> 38:53.622
I know they're supposed
to know the way to Earth.

38:55.375 --> 38:58.293
But you don't know that
you're one of them?

No, look, I'm not
giving you any names.

39:13.977 --> 39:16.270
Not until I feel
like I'm safe.

39:16.771 --> 39:19.523
'Cause information
is all I got, sweetie.

39:21.568 --> 39:23.110
I'm mortal now.

39:24.446 --> 39:28.198
In fact, I'm the only Three
in the whole darn universe,

39:28.283 --> 39:31.035
so I gotta worry about
protecting myself.

I'll tell you who the Final Five are
when you take me back to your fleet.

39:38.585 --> 39:42.046
And by the way, Laura, I
would've said the same thing

39:42.130 --> 39:44.965
if you'd have met me
with a whole lot of Cylons,

39:45.050 --> 39:47.676
'cause I don't trust
anyone right now.

39:48.470 --> 39:52.723
So all this deception,
complete waste of time.

retainer along with the line and wiring.

You lied to me.

Did I?

I thought I was earning
humanity's right to survive.

trumpets, "Here's the way to Earth. "

Disorienting,
isn't it?
