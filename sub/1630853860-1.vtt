WEBVTT

00:44.169 --> 00:44.961
Thanks.

00:53.512 --> 00:54.845
Why not sit?

00:55.472 --> 00:57.557
Oh, okay.

01:04.439 --> 01:06.440
No need to be formal.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.110
But, I'm younger...

01:09.361 --> 01:10.486
How old?

01:12.864 --> 01:13.990
15.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.284
I'm only two years older.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.371
Well, yeah.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.498
Have some.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.004
A glass...

01:28.380 --> 01:29.839
Where's your mom?

01:31.300 --> 01:35.094
She's at work.
She'll be home soon.

01:36.346 --> 01:37.597
Riku! Riku! Riku!

01:37.931 --> 01:39.849
Read this for me.

01:40.225 --> 01:41.684
Sorao..

01:42.936 --> 01:45.479
Ah! Excuse me!

01:46.815 --> 01:49.400
Oh, you move in today?

01:50.110 --> 01:52.445
Thanks for having me.
I'm Yuko.

01:52.696 --> 01:55.239
I'm Sorao.
Nice to meet you.

01:55.365 --> 01:58.367
15 minutes till deadline.
Crunch time.

01:58.493 --> 01:59.910
Deadline?

02:00.037 --> 02:03.664
My "Moguran and Tatsumaru" script.
A kids' show.

02:03.790 --> 02:07.585
Really?! That's amazing!
You're a scriptwriter?

02:07.711 --> 02:13.215
Yes. I'm actually a novelist,
but I do this too sometimes.

02:14.134 --> 02:17.887
Oh, I know it!
It's so cute.

02:18.138 --> 02:22.099
It's really about Earth
after humanity dies out.

02:22.934 --> 02:25.686
Yeah.. I like it.

02:26.063 --> 02:28.105
Ending's a bit abrupt.

02:28.398 --> 02:31.817
Did you get the
anti-patriarchal message?

02:32.903 --> 02:34.528
Not at all.

02:36.198 --> 02:40.034
Never mind. Riku, thanks!
Later, Yuko.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.043
Your dad?

02:49.336 --> 02:51.295
No, no.

02:51.421 --> 02:52.963
What is he then?

02:55.550 --> 02:57.760
Er, how can I put it..

02:58.970 --> 03:03.140
My mom's friend lives here too.

03:04.559 --> 03:06.519
He's her boyfriend.

03:07.896 --> 03:11.148
So, the four of you all live here?

03:13.402 --> 03:14.610
Weird.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.405
I get that a lot.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.532
Dad's not around?

03:20.951 --> 03:23.160
- He's not.
- Mine too.

03:23.370 --> 03:24.662
Divorce?

03:26.665 --> 03:28.290
Same here.

03:35.632 --> 03:40.177
It seems our moms
have been friends a long time.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.013
Yeah, but..

03:43.140 --> 03:44.473
I'm home!

03:44.599 --> 03:45.599
There she is.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.814
Hi...

04:04.619 --> 04:08.122
Art college prep school?
That takes me back.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.040
You studied art, Meiko?

04:10.167 --> 04:14.503
Yeah. No Tokyo prep school though.
You're brave.

04:14.629 --> 04:18.549
No, it's just summer school.
Like a trial course.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.676
In Year 2 of high school?

04:23.013 --> 04:25.389
Wow, that looks great!

04:25.682 --> 04:29.185
Yuko's in my room,
so you're with Riku.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.062
Hi roomie.

04:33.064 --> 04:35.024
Sorao, you'll drink?

04:35.233 --> 04:37.318
Sure. It's a welcome party.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.487
Sure is, sure is..

04:39.613 --> 04:41.906
Hey! Take this.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.158
Thanks.

04:44.784 --> 04:47.536
So so so.

04:47.871 --> 04:51.540
Yuko, your mom's
the famous Tomoyo?

04:51.833 --> 04:53.751
Oh, yes. That's right.

04:53.877 --> 04:55.628
I'm a big fan of her.

04:56.087 --> 04:58.255
Yeah? Really?

04:58.548 --> 05:04.136
I follow her Insta, and suggested her
at work. Also, you know...

05:05.347 --> 05:07.598
There. Shall we eat?

05:07.724 --> 05:10.142
Wow, it looks delish!

05:12.896 --> 05:15.731
Yuko, welcome to the house of Aoba.

05:16.608 --> 05:19.360
Looking forward to these two weeks.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.403
Now then.

05:22.197 --> 05:24.281
Bless this food!

05:24.574 --> 05:30.412
AROUND THE TABLE

06:03.488 --> 06:04.989
What's this..?

06:06.658 --> 06:09.410
I'm on breakfast duty this week.

06:09.536 --> 06:13.122
Sorry. He's into tacos,
so it's tacos everyday.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.584
It's tacos research month.

06:17.836 --> 06:19.837
Yuko, use this lunchbox.

06:19.963 --> 06:21.839
Oh, thank you.

06:24.134 --> 06:25.342
Where's Riku?

06:25.719 --> 06:26.886
Band practice.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.178
His band?

06:28.305 --> 06:30.514
He's crazy about it lately.

06:32.309 --> 06:35.102
Yuko, day one of prep school huh?

06:35.562 --> 06:37.438
I'm nervous.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.148
Hang in there.

06:39.274 --> 06:40.733
You'll be fine.

07:11.848 --> 07:16.226
Sharpen each pencil with sincerity.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.165
Need this?

07:48.218 --> 07:49.760
Don't know how?

07:50.762 --> 07:52.137
It's my first day.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.682
It's my first day too.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.227
Give it to me.

08:11.282 --> 08:14.660
"Welcome party after school!"

09:15.972 --> 09:20.434
"Take Chocolate Sleepover's
debut single 'This Won't Do, '

09:20.685 --> 09:22.519
and interpret it your way."

09:22.645 --> 09:24.605
"Your way," huh?

09:24.981 --> 09:26.315
"Your cover version."

09:28.234 --> 09:31.695
"The group will
assess entries thoroughly..."

09:31.821 --> 09:35.449
The winning band
gets invited to their show.

09:36.367 --> 09:40.412
I know already.
How many times have you read that?

09:40.955 --> 09:42.956
Let me read it, okay?

09:43.082 --> 09:47.961
They suddenly reformed,
and there's a cover competition!

09:48.087 --> 09:52.925
They broke up 20 years ago.
You're such a nerd.

09:53.092 --> 09:57.596
If we send them our cover,
will Recman listen to it?!

09:58.139 --> 09:59.848
Highly probable.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.518
Enough already.
Let's practice.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.730
Fancy some corn tea?

10:06.898 --> 10:08.565
Hi Mr. Daikuhara.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.276
A band, huh? Way to go.

10:11.402 --> 10:12.402
Too noisy?

10:12.529 --> 10:15.823
No way! I was in a band.
Those were the days...

10:15.949 --> 10:20.536
Okay Dad. Take your cue
to leave. Smartly.

10:20.662 --> 10:23.163
Take your time!
There's more tea.

10:25.834 --> 10:29.128
Let's listen to their
indie songs again.

10:31.422 --> 10:37.052
Um, I want to be an illustrator,
so I'm applying for Graphic Design.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.639
Nice to meet you.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.600
Okay, next. Yudai.

10:44.644 --> 10:50.816
I'm Yudai Seo. I like music, movies,
design, and more. Nice to meet you.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.110
Say where you're interning.

10:56.281 --> 11:00.492
Well, I'm an intern at
design office HA9.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.328
Yudai, you don't need school.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.497
A national college for me.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.333
Don't say "Huh?!"

11:08.626 --> 11:10.252
Nice to meet you!

11:10.587 --> 11:12.296
Okay, next.

11:15.008 --> 11:20.637
I'm Yuko Kunieda. I like music,
movies, all kinds of culture.

11:21.472 --> 11:24.391
I started a YouTube channel too.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.019
And, um..

11:42.160 --> 11:47.039
My mother is Tomoyo Kunieda.
She gets interviewed a lot,

11:47.165 --> 11:52.169
so lately I've been thinking
a media job might be good too.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.176
Nice to meet you.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.762
Applause!

12:03.139 --> 12:04.723
Okay, next.

12:05.683 --> 12:09.436
Um, I'm Koyuki Sato.
I want to create manga...

12:15.526 --> 12:19.154
So Akane,
you're not from Tokyo either?

12:20.448 --> 12:24.826
My big sister lives here,
so I'm staying with her.

12:24.953 --> 12:26.495
Right, right.

12:28.289 --> 12:32.960
That Yudai guy's interning
even through he's a high schooler.

12:34.045 --> 12:35.963
What a cocky jerk.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.092
But he's the most talented.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.428
National college-bound, and a rival.

12:43.638 --> 12:45.639
You want to go too?

12:46.474 --> 12:48.433
Private's too hard.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.939
What about you?

12:56.317 --> 12:58.318
I'm still wavering.

13:13.584 --> 13:15.127
I should get going.

13:15.253 --> 13:18.630
Huh? Already?
Despite your hair color?

13:18.756 --> 13:20.632
What about my hair color?

13:21.175 --> 13:23.093
My sister'll worry.

13:23.594 --> 13:24.803
Hey...

13:27.890 --> 13:32.269
Um...
My mom's on TV today.

13:35.690 --> 13:36.773
Better hurry.

13:37.483 --> 13:40.485
So I... don't want to go back.

13:51.164 --> 13:57.669
A casual Chinese restaurant
with a refined decor.

13:58.963 --> 14:04.968
Proprietor Tomoyo Kunieda's
unique lifestyle is drawing attention.

14:05.887 --> 14:10.057
Her three books have
all become bestsellers.

14:11.059 --> 14:14.227
Hey. I'll do the dishes later.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.896
Nearly done.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.776
Too bad Yuko's late tonight.

14:20.902 --> 14:24.404
What do I pride myself on?
Nothing!

14:24.530 --> 14:27.449
But if I have to name one thing,

14:27.784 --> 14:30.369
it's talking to my customers.

14:31.162 --> 14:34.247
I talk to them, eagerly...

14:34.373 --> 14:37.751
Haruko, you've got such a famous friend.

14:38.252 --> 14:41.671
Well, I haven't seen her in years.

14:42.673 --> 14:46.635
Manpuku's signature menu item
is "Hah-chan rice."

14:46.761 --> 14:48.512
One Hah-chan rice!

14:48.638 --> 14:51.473
A simple but addictive dish.

14:53.267 --> 14:56.103
Having a stylish mom is pretty hard.

14:56.646 --> 15:00.232
"Her daughter must
be cool too," people say.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.275
Sounds annoying.

15:02.819 --> 15:08.240
So I study movies, music and stuff
so I can be cooler.

15:11.494 --> 15:12.994
You're a YouTuber?

15:13.121 --> 15:15.038
Yeah, I just started..

15:15.164 --> 15:17.249
- Lemme see.
- Huh? Not yet...

15:17.375 --> 15:19.793
- Show me.
- My editing sucks.

15:22.797 --> 15:24.548
Okay, I'm outta here.

15:28.136 --> 15:32.556
You know those times when
you've got to knuckle down?

15:32.682 --> 15:38.103
To fire myself up,
I take big deep breaths.

15:40.314 --> 15:43.817
I suck in as much air
as my lungs can take,

15:43.943 --> 15:47.487
then I feel like taking on the world.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.615
Give it a try.
Breathe in like "Hah."

15:50.741 --> 15:54.244
That's it. Breathe in.
Feel like a world-beater?

15:54.662 --> 15:57.497
I do it when I need a boost.

15:57.623 --> 16:02.335
I really recommend it.
It's almost like a magic spell.

16:03.796 --> 16:09.634
When I read a book or watch a film,
I write down my impressions,

16:09.760 --> 16:12.345
so their art becomes my own flesh.

16:14.056 --> 16:17.601
You... edited this yourself?

16:17.977 --> 16:23.064
Yeah. It's more a hobby than art.
The narration's just a stopgap.

16:26.027 --> 16:30.071
I honestly don't want
to rely on my mother's fame,

16:30.198 --> 16:33.200
so I've decided to hone my own senses.

16:33.534 --> 16:39.456
Yuko Kunieda's Nine Essences.
Essence 1: Don't use my mother's name.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.417
You broke your essence!

16:42.543 --> 16:46.338
Shut up! I hate myself for doing that!

16:46.672 --> 16:48.924
You're so funny!

16:50.176 --> 16:54.304
Mom got interviewed at
home, so I thought I'd try.

16:54.513 --> 16:58.016
Are you nuts?
You envy your mom?

16:58.517 --> 16:59.935
Is that pathetic?

17:00.102 --> 17:02.229
No, it's awesome.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.605
Really?

17:05.942 --> 17:07.943
I like you, Yuko.

17:11.489 --> 17:14.991
Hey, why don't we make
something together?

17:15.284 --> 17:17.410
Good idea. Like what?

17:22.792 --> 17:24.251
Dunno. Any ideas?

17:24.377 --> 17:27.629
Come on, it was your idea.

17:28.130 --> 17:33.718
Oh man. How about.. a zine?

17:34.053 --> 17:36.388
You mean, of our illustrations?

17:36.556 --> 17:41.101
Illustrations or anything.
A magazine of stuff we like.

17:41.394 --> 17:44.271
Wow! I love it! I love it!

17:44.397 --> 17:47.816
Okay, we'll take turns
drawing in a notebook.

17:48.317 --> 17:51.486
It'll be done by the end of the course.

17:51.862 --> 17:54.698
Fantastic!
Let's do it! Promise me!

17:54.824 --> 17:56.449
Alright. Not so close.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.368
Oh, sorry.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.371
I love it. A zine.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.634
'Morning.

18:16.387 --> 18:17.387
'Morning.

18:18.973 --> 18:20.682
You get stubble?

18:21.684 --> 18:24.644
Yeah. Quite a lot.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.188
Is that your own razor?

18:29.108 --> 18:33.320
This is Sorao's, but I'll buy my own.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.535
Sorry, I'll hurry.

18:40.661 --> 18:42.579
Oh, you don't have to.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.583
You like Chocolate Sleepover?

18:50.004 --> 18:51.379
I like them too.

18:51.505 --> 18:55.216
Huh? Really?
No way! How come?

18:55.426 --> 18:57.802
Well, my parents liked them.

18:57.928 --> 18:58.970
Ah, me too!

18:59.096 --> 19:00.930
You wore their t-shirt.

19:01.057 --> 19:04.976
Isn't it cool?
Lend it to me. Just kidding.

19:05.728 --> 19:06.853
My t-shirt?

19:06.979 --> 19:09.648
Yeah. I like the design.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.984
Okay. Wait right there.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.446
Huh? Doesn't have to be now..

19:28.918 --> 19:30.210
- Ta-da!
- Our zine'’!

19:30.336 --> 19:34.089
Whoa! Akane, this is great!

19:34.215 --> 19:36.091
I stayed up till late.

19:36.425 --> 19:39.636
The colors and the
feel of it are so cool.

19:39.762 --> 19:42.013
Okay! My turn next.

19:42.723 --> 19:46.351
If we do it everyday,
it'll be pretty big.

19:46.477 --> 19:48.770
What's a good subject?

19:50.523 --> 19:52.273
- You'll find one.
- Hey...

19:53.317 --> 19:54.818
You like that band?

19:57.530 --> 20:01.074
Few people our age like them.
I'm so stoked!

20:01.200 --> 20:05.620
Favorite song? Top hard.
Sorry! I'll tell you mine.

20:05.746 --> 20:09.958
Wait, which one?
A different one every day.

20:10.084 --> 20:14.504
Lately, after 45 listens,
'This Won't Do" is best!

20:14.630 --> 20:19.884
That hidden lyric "knock knock"
actually might be "nonchalant," but...

20:21.720 --> 20:23.138
That was creepy.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.307
Did he ramble on for 30 minutes?

20:26.434 --> 20:29.394
His own words made him teary-eyed.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.812
What a creep.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.939
What a creep!

20:34.024 --> 20:37.986
Yudai knows so much about music.

20:39.029 --> 20:40.613
Yudai Seo.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.073
Why his full name?

20:42.199 --> 20:45.660
I wanted to say it.
I like the sound of it.

20:46.203 --> 20:47.787
For real?

20:48.080 --> 20:50.623
Akane, your sketches are amazing.

20:51.125 --> 20:55.628
Well, Yudai got better feedback than me.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.923
He's my rival.

20:59.508 --> 21:02.594
Yudai Seo..

21:16.525 --> 21:18.818
Madoka, you've got rhythm.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.153
It's kinda fun.

21:24.241 --> 21:28.077
How do we interpret it our way?

21:30.664 --> 21:32.081
I wanna rap.

21:32.208 --> 21:37.128
No no no, it won't be a cover then.
Get with the program.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.547
What would Recman do?

21:40.674 --> 21:42.300
Let's rethink it.

21:43.010 --> 21:46.095
Hey, how about we
play it 100% faster?

21:53.270 --> 21:54.771
What was that?

21:55.898 --> 22:00.318
This place has always
made strange noises.

22:00.569 --> 22:06.074
Like... the end of the world,
or something.

22:07.243 --> 22:08.910
Supernatural?

22:15.209 --> 22:16.334
Let's go look.

22:22.758 --> 22:23.758
Hurry.

22:41.318 --> 22:46.364
Dear Akane. There's something
I have to tell you about myself.

22:46.490 --> 22:49.742
Let me explain my history of creativity.

22:50.411 --> 22:51.619
Ta-da!

22:53.205 --> 22:54.038
Well?

22:54.164 --> 22:55.331
It's cute.

22:55.874 --> 23:00.545
I once wanted to be a clay artist,
but it didn't feel right.

23:02.131 --> 23:06.551
I learned guitar too,
but skipped my school festival.

23:07.177 --> 23:12.765
I tried dying t-shirts,
and taking photos. It wasn't for me.

23:13.225 --> 23:17.729
I made videos for YouTube,
but never released them.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.190
I also did skateboarding.

23:22.651 --> 23:27.989
Whenever I tried something,
I loved it, but for some reason..

23:29.700 --> 23:33.036
It felt wrong.
Like it didn't fit me.

23:33.162 --> 23:37.624
So many abandoned efforts. Why?

23:41.795 --> 23:43.796
Creative history's a cool idea.

23:44.006 --> 23:49.010
I come from a boring backwater town,
so I can't wait to get into art college.

23:49.928 --> 23:53.598
When I'm older,
I want to design lots of books.

23:56.685 --> 23:59.437
Akane, your dream is clear-cut.

23:59.563 --> 24:05.360
I'd like to be that passionate,
but sketching is so damn hard.

24:05.486 --> 24:07.278
You're not looking.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.073
Look closely.

24:10.824 --> 24:12.241
I'll show you.

24:13.452 --> 24:18.081
I did badly again today,
so I practiced at home.

24:18.332 --> 24:24.212
Hands are so familiar to us,
but their shape is so surprising.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.673
Way to go.
You've got it.

24:26.882 --> 24:28.549
Potential's all I've got.

24:31.553 --> 24:34.055
"Hands of the House of Aoba"

24:34.181 --> 24:35.348
Well done.

24:35.474 --> 24:41.104
At the House of Aoba where I stay,
Haruko usually makes dinner,

24:41.355 --> 24:44.190
and it's always so delicious!

24:45.234 --> 24:46.776
This is great!

24:49.780 --> 24:54.033
Then the other day,
she suddenly said she'd quit,

24:54.159 --> 24:58.413
so Meiko took over
and started preparing dinner.

24:58.997 --> 25:05.670
Her motto is to never use a knife,
but it's surprisingly, super tasty!

25:06.004 --> 25:07.338
Wow..

25:07.464 --> 25:09.007
It's so good!

25:09.341 --> 25:12.593
Breakfasts are still
Sorao's taco experiments.

25:13.762 --> 25:17.682
We're sick of them,
and we keep complaining...

25:22.479 --> 25:24.397
but we can't help eating.

25:24.898 --> 25:28.818
It's fun to see Sorao,
watching us proudly

25:28.944 --> 25:30.653
I want tacos too..

25:30.779 --> 25:32.321
So do I.

25:32.448 --> 25:34.115
"One-minute sketches"

25:37.077 --> 25:41.748
Yudai Seo.
My greatest current interest.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.207
Okay, next!

25:47.921 --> 25:50.798
Huh? What's so great about him

25:53.093 --> 25:54.177
What?

25:54.553 --> 25:57.055
Akane, he's not your enemy.

26:02.436 --> 26:03.561
Riku?

26:03.896 --> 26:05.229
Knock, please!

26:05.647 --> 26:07.023
Oh sorry, sorry.

26:07.149 --> 26:08.816
Can you play this?

26:29.588 --> 26:32.840
A guy called Yudai made this mix CD.

26:32.966 --> 26:35.176
Mix as in lots of artists...

26:35.302 --> 26:37.053
I know what it means.

26:37.179 --> 26:38.805
Oh sorry, sorry.

26:40.182 --> 26:43.643
He went to the trouble
of making it for me.

26:49.566 --> 26:52.944
Wow, I don't know any of these songs.

26:53.445 --> 26:55.530
I know some of them.

26:57.741 --> 26:59.408
I like this one.

27:00.494 --> 27:02.286
So do I.

27:02.871 --> 27:05.748
Your t-shirt brought us together.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.835
He likes the same band!

27:10.420 --> 27:13.840
He even got a ticket to their next show.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.552
I wish I could go..

27:24.685 --> 27:26.144
Want to..

27:27.563 --> 27:29.230
Join my band?

27:43.495 --> 27:46.164
I joined a junior high band.

27:47.791 --> 27:49.500
I like it.

27:55.841 --> 27:58.718
I like where they rehearse too.

27:59.636 --> 28:02.471
That happens a lot here.

28:06.643 --> 28:07.560
Not again..

28:13.066 --> 28:14.567
Isn't it too much?

28:14.693 --> 28:16.986
I think it's just right.

28:17.237 --> 28:18.988
I want a grown-up look.

28:19.114 --> 28:21.949
A high school look's better for you.

28:22.075 --> 28:23.910
Everybody'll be older.

28:24.161 --> 28:25.203
That's why.

28:25.329 --> 28:27.413
Looking mature's good, yeah?

28:29.875 --> 28:32.126
Ah, how about this?

28:32.794 --> 28:33.961
It's cute!

28:34.296 --> 28:37.715
A design office party...
What's that?

28:39.718 --> 28:41.427
It's beyond me.

28:43.013 --> 28:44.347
And this too.

28:44.473 --> 28:45.973
It's pretty.

28:47.017 --> 28:49.310
It's beyond my solar system.

28:49.603 --> 28:51.646
Bigger earrings, you think?

28:51.897 --> 28:53.564
Oh, great!

28:55.442 --> 28:58.527
Man, I'm really nervous now.

28:59.529 --> 29:01.781
Are you sure we can come too?

29:01.907 --> 29:03.866
Yeah, friends are okay.

29:03.992 --> 29:05.618
We better hurry then.

29:05.744 --> 29:06.869
You're keen.

29:06.995 --> 29:09.121
So I can leave early.

29:09.331 --> 29:10.623
Why'd you come?

29:10.832 --> 29:12.166
To chaperone Yuko.

29:12.292 --> 29:13.501
Thanks.

29:14.294 --> 29:17.129
Anyway, what's with the weird getup?

29:17.547 --> 29:19.131
Huh? What's weird?

29:20.467 --> 29:22.134
The faked grownup look.

29:22.260 --> 29:23.761
Yeah, you're right.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.430
This is a disaster..

29:27.307 --> 29:28.516
Here.

29:28.976 --> 29:30.184
Swap you.

29:41.279 --> 29:42.863
Looks better on me.

29:43.073 --> 29:44.824
Gimme a break.

29:48.745 --> 29:50.413
Looks good on you.

29:53.875 --> 29:56.294
Okay. Shall we go?

30:02.300 --> 30:04.176
"3rd anniversary"

30:04.928 --> 30:06.137
Thank you!

30:06.263 --> 30:07.263
Have fun.

30:08.557 --> 30:09.932
Hello!

30:11.893 --> 30:12.643
What?

30:12.769 --> 30:17.398
I so wanted to read this.
It's out of print.

30:18.483 --> 30:19.817
Yuko.

30:24.114 --> 30:25.531
This is Yuko.

30:26.324 --> 30:31.078
These people let me intern here,
Yashiki and Shimasa.

30:31.204 --> 30:33.456
Hello. The famous Yuko.

30:37.294 --> 30:38.753
I'm Yuko Kunieda.

30:40.172 --> 30:43.382
Wow. A business card.

30:44.551 --> 30:46.844
Sorry, I ran out of mine.

30:46.970 --> 30:52.767
Oh, it's fine. I've seen your gum ads
all over Odakyu trains,

30:52.893 --> 30:56.687
and your album covers.
Your work's always cool.

30:56.813 --> 31:00.107
No, we're just getting off the ground.

31:03.653 --> 31:06.739
Yudai, could you help at reception?

31:06.865 --> 31:09.575
Sure! Okay Yuko, see you later.

31:12.788 --> 31:14.246
Something to drink?

31:21.338 --> 31:26.801
I'm interested in this kind of work.
Are you all art college grads?

31:27.552 --> 31:29.720
Well, about 50% of us are.

31:29.846 --> 31:32.640
Wow. Is that right?

31:35.894 --> 31:39.355
What's Tomoyo like in everyday life?

31:41.358 --> 31:44.360
Um, like everyone else.

31:44.528 --> 31:46.237
Takes saunas to unwind.

31:46.363 --> 31:49.365
She posted about them on Insta first.

31:49.491 --> 31:50.491
She sure did.

31:50.617 --> 31:55.830
She took me to one once,
but it was so hot I had to leave.

31:57.791 --> 31:59.375
Well, they are hot.

32:03.463 --> 32:05.381
Oh, we have that glass.

32:05.507 --> 32:07.800
For real?
Lucky, me and Tomoyo.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.844
She uses stuff like this?

32:09.970 --> 32:12.680
She's not bothered by price.

32:12.806 --> 32:14.014
You don't say!

32:14.141 --> 32:16.267
I like that about her.

32:16.643 --> 32:17.810
That is her.

32:17.936 --> 32:21.730
Yeah, she's got it all.
Balanced, you know?

32:21.857 --> 32:24.150
Unbalanced, but balanced.

32:24.276 --> 32:27.027
An advanced level of balance.

32:27.154 --> 32:28.362
I'm smitten.

32:28.488 --> 32:31.615
How often does Tomoyo
come back to Tokyo?

32:31.741 --> 32:34.201
Tomoyo...
Tomoyo...

32:41.168 --> 32:43.210
Sorry, may I throw up?

32:43.879 --> 32:45.212
May I throw up?

32:45.338 --> 32:46.172
Y-You okay?

32:46.298 --> 32:47.298
I feel sick.

32:47.424 --> 32:49.800
Not there! Not there!

32:49.926 --> 32:51.552
Where can I then?

32:51.678 --> 32:53.262
N-Nowhere here!

32:53.471 --> 32:58.767
Hold it in! Hold it in!
Somebody help! Help!

33:07.736 --> 33:09.028
Thanks for that.

33:11.281 --> 33:14.366
Damn, I should've thrown up.

33:17.537 --> 33:20.247
I brought up my mom again.

33:21.041 --> 33:23.125
They wanted you to.

33:23.251 --> 33:26.587
Yeah. People like
hearing about her more.

33:34.596 --> 33:36.555
You know, it's like...

33:38.600 --> 33:43.562
We're young, so we get looked down on,
and that's infuriating,

33:44.564 --> 33:48.442
but we've got
our whole lives ahead of us.

33:49.819 --> 33:53.364
We can study and
become anything we want.

33:54.616 --> 34:00.996
We can say "This is me!"
and be proud of it.

34:04.584 --> 34:06.085
Maybe.

34:07.254 --> 34:11.715
There I go, talking all idealistically.

34:11.883 --> 34:14.760
No, thank you, Akane.

34:14.886 --> 34:17.721
I forgot I have amazing potential.

34:18.098 --> 34:19.640
Damn right.

34:26.815 --> 34:31.193
I like your art, but I
also like your writing.

34:32.279 --> 34:36.323
I want to read more about you,
not somebody else.

34:36.533 --> 34:37.992
Really?

34:41.496 --> 34:45.332
Back in my hometown, nobody gets me.

34:45.458 --> 34:46.959
Same here.

34:47.877 --> 34:52.298
But, thanks to books, I got this far.

34:54.050 --> 34:56.594
So I want to do book design.

34:59.889 --> 35:01.849
Books that girls like me

35:02.100 --> 35:06.520
would look at and think,
"Ah, this is for me."

35:12.652 --> 35:13.861
Ta-da!

35:14.321 --> 35:16.113
I stole it as revenge.

35:16.239 --> 35:18.198
Whoa, you're a bad girl!

35:19.367 --> 35:21.243
Hey, gimme your card.

35:38.970 --> 35:42.222
Great. A new bookmark.

35:42.349 --> 35:44.642
Huh?! Then give it back!

36:00.992 --> 36:04.662
"This Won't Do"

36:26.267 --> 36:28.644
"Mock exam: charcoal sketch"

36:50.041 --> 36:52.376
Okay, we'll go buy food.

36:52.502 --> 36:54.503
Alright, take care.

36:54.838 --> 36:56.463
See you later.

37:03.388 --> 37:06.056
Yuko mentioned a mock exam.

37:06.474 --> 37:09.101
Yeah, she'll be back soon.

37:11.521 --> 37:13.313
I'm back.

37:13.523 --> 37:15.274
There she is.

37:18.695 --> 37:19.862
Huh?

37:33.877 --> 37:35.627
Let her sleep?

37:37.797 --> 37:40.966
Yuko, want to head out?

37:41.176 --> 37:42.885
Huh? Where?

37:43.219 --> 37:44.553
You know where.

38:00.278 --> 38:03.655
Excellent.
All to ourselves again.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.866
This is amazing.

38:06.409 --> 38:12.247
Cool, yeah? The city started
this night pool, but nobody comes.

38:13.500 --> 38:16.877
We come here sometimes
and drink together.

38:27.805 --> 38:32.351
Our sketches were lined up
according to their ranking.

38:33.353 --> 38:39.191
My best friend's was at the top,
but mine was bottom.

38:42.195 --> 38:44.988
Art evaluation's so harsh.

38:45.365 --> 38:51.495
I realize I'm so below everybody,
and it's embarrassing, and frustrating.

38:51.829 --> 38:52.913
Most of all,

38:54.541 --> 38:59.086
I feel like I'm always a letdown,
and it's paralyzing.

39:01.714 --> 39:05.217
A letdown... to Tomoyo?

39:08.054 --> 39:13.725
Mom knows me through and through.
Whatever I want to wear, watch,

39:14.060 --> 39:19.064
or study, she knows
exactly what suits me.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.942
She's always right.

39:23.945 --> 39:29.366
I always loved art, so I said I'd do it
and got this far, but...

39:30.451 --> 39:33.370
I messed up,
same pattern as always.

39:36.332 --> 39:37.749
I get it.

39:41.921 --> 39:47.885
Sorry. You think I wouldn't,
but sorry, only I get it. Sorry.

39:48.136 --> 39:50.345
Sorry to interrupt.
Keep going.

39:50.805 --> 39:52.389
You say sorry a lot.

39:54.267 --> 39:56.059
So, my mom...

39:56.185 --> 39:59.688
Apologies for saying
this in front of a fan,

39:59.981 --> 40:04.067
but she's got a tendency
to "produce" everything.

40:04.819 --> 40:08.822
She's way too confident!
She always has been!

40:10.033 --> 40:13.327
Haruko, you and my mom..

40:16.581 --> 40:19.917
We haven't spoken for 20 years.

40:22.962 --> 40:24.630
You haven't?

40:38.061 --> 40:39.895
Where did they go?

40:41.981 --> 40:47.152
"Just heading out" means...
walking-in-sandals distance?

40:49.197 --> 40:52.157
Some people go on vacation in sandals.

40:52.533 --> 40:54.284
Good point.

40:57.914 --> 41:01.458
Okay. All that's left is to fry them.

41:02.001 --> 41:03.001
Want to try?

41:03.127 --> 41:04.503
Yeah!

41:06.964 --> 41:08.799
Be careful.

41:16.391 --> 41:17.724
That's the way.

41:18.559 --> 41:20.143
Wow.

41:29.112 --> 41:34.032
After graduating university,
we drifted around for a while.

41:35.368 --> 41:39.913
We kept talking about
opening a restaurant together.

41:41.082 --> 41:42.874
But then you..

41:44.127 --> 41:45.711
We didn't.

41:46.462 --> 41:51.675
For various reasons, we went
our separate ways, and lost touch.

42:00.601 --> 42:02.978
My mom is Tomoyo Kunieda,

42:03.271 --> 42:06.606
so I've got to become my own person.

42:06.941 --> 42:12.279
I've tried lots of things,
but none of them felt right.

42:13.948 --> 42:20.287
My prep school friends know what
they want to be, and are going for it.

42:20.913 --> 42:23.999
I don't even know what I want to be.

42:27.211 --> 42:29.755
What you want to be, huh...

42:35.803 --> 42:38.555
There! That stupid deep breathing!

42:38.681 --> 42:40.140
Go easy on her..

42:40.391 --> 42:42.601
It's so pretentious.

42:42.727 --> 42:46.396
She said the same crap
in a magazine interview.

42:46.647 --> 42:48.482
You check what she does?

42:48.608 --> 42:52.861
I'll be brutally honest.
I check everything she does!

42:52.987 --> 42:53.695
Seriously?!

42:54.071 --> 42:55.781
Haruko, you're crazy!

42:55.907 --> 42:58.116
They're best friends now?

42:58.951 --> 43:00.535
Beats me..

43:08.169 --> 43:11.421
Hey. You don't have to try so hard.

43:13.758 --> 43:18.053
I mean, you should do
what you've got to do,

43:18.471 --> 43:22.933
but, if it doesn't feel right,
try something else.

43:24.310 --> 43:26.228
You think so?

43:26.687 --> 43:31.108
Yeah. Until you find
one thing that's for you.

43:32.735 --> 43:34.111
I agree.

43:35.404 --> 43:38.532
Right. One thing.

43:41.744 --> 43:45.455
Okay! This summer,
I'll find that one thing.

43:45.998 --> 43:48.041
Go for it!

43:50.211 --> 43:54.923
It's as if who I was
20 years ago is saying that.

43:58.845 --> 44:00.220
Got it.

44:01.973 --> 44:06.935
Yuko, I think I'll go see Tomoyo.

44:08.187 --> 44:13.650
It's been bugging me for years,
but I'm going to settle it.

44:47.476 --> 44:48.810
You okay?

44:48.936 --> 44:50.604
Why wouldn't I be?

44:50.730 --> 44:53.899
Well, you got criticized
badly yesterday.

44:54.025 --> 44:56.193
I slept and forgot it.

44:56.360 --> 44:58.737
Today's our band recording.

44:59.238 --> 45:00.822
That's important?

45:00.948 --> 45:03.992
Oh, Akane, tonight. Okay?

45:06.662 --> 45:08.622
Don't forget.

45:22.845 --> 45:25.722
"Manpuku"

45:25.848 --> 45:30.560
Open for lunch only today!

45:41.656 --> 45:43.657
Excuse me.

45:44.367 --> 45:46.618
Sorry, today is lunch only!

45:46.744 --> 45:49.996
Oh, I'm not a customer.

45:50.122 --> 45:53.541
I'm Tomoyo's classmate,
Haruko Aoba.

45:55.753 --> 45:58.046
Is Tomoyo in?

45:59.006 --> 46:02.217
Tomoyo's with a foreign TV crew.

46:02.843 --> 46:06.096
A foreign TV crew?
I see...

46:06.222 --> 46:09.849
Okay, I'll kill time
nearby, and come back.

46:09.976 --> 46:15.105
Oh no! Please wait!
This is a special case, so...

46:18.109 --> 46:20.735
Please sit here if you like!

46:21.862 --> 46:23.113
Are you sure?

46:23.280 --> 46:24.739
Please, please!

46:24.865 --> 46:25.949
Alright.

46:27.618 --> 46:28.910
Excuse me.

46:40.006 --> 46:41.923
I'll bring some tea!

46:42.800 --> 46:44.467
Thank you.

47:22.423 --> 47:23.923
Hey there!

47:27.595 --> 47:29.179
That's great.

47:32.808 --> 47:36.686
"Closed"

47:46.113 --> 47:46.946
Refill!

47:47.073 --> 47:48.573
Thank you.

48:05.216 --> 48:09.135
I'm back!
Kosuke, thanks a lot!

48:09.261 --> 48:11.054
Hope it went well!

48:11.180 --> 48:13.390
Your friend is here..

48:18.896 --> 48:22.023
Tomoyo.
Long time no see.

48:32.076 --> 48:34.744
Way too long!

48:36.997 --> 48:38.832
Way too long...

48:42.044 --> 48:45.296
I would've made a
reservation if you'd called.

48:45.506 --> 48:48.341
The Thai place might still be open..

48:48.467 --> 48:51.803
Oh, don't mind me.
Sorry it's so sudden.

48:52.138 --> 48:55.807
I should apologize,
for dumping Yuko on you.

48:56.100 --> 49:00.645
Yeah. You messaged me
out of the blue. I was shocked.

49:00.771 --> 49:02.772
I'm sorry, really.

49:05.943 --> 49:07.444
Been well?

49:07.903 --> 49:11.114
As you can see.
I'm getting by.

49:13.159 --> 49:14.701
This place is nice.

49:14.827 --> 49:17.036
I always wanted you to come.

49:17.454 --> 49:19.164
You know, timing..

49:24.628 --> 49:26.713
I hope she's not a problem.

49:27.256 --> 49:29.799
Not at all.
She's a great kid.

49:29.925 --> 49:33.595
You must be joking.
She's a pain, isn't she?

49:33.721 --> 49:38.141
She's not a pain.
She confided in me too.

49:38.267 --> 49:39.601
About what?

49:44.315 --> 49:46.316
Where should I start..

49:47.735 --> 49:48.735
Well..

49:48.861 --> 49:51.863
It's okay.
I pretty much know anyway.

49:56.577 --> 50:00.246
Hey, what kind of job do you do now?

50:01.290 --> 50:04.167
I sell knickknacks and clothes online.

50:04.293 --> 50:08.713
Wow, that's cool.
You always did love clothes.

50:09.173 --> 50:11.799
That outfit looks good on you.

50:12.551 --> 50:13.635
Thanks.

50:13.761 --> 50:17.555
You always liked
colors and fabrics like that.

50:17.932 --> 50:20.058
Huh? I wouldn't say that.

50:20.893 --> 50:22.143
You haven't changed.

50:24.146 --> 50:26.606
They look good on you, but...

50:30.653 --> 50:31.569
What?

50:31.695 --> 50:33.238
Oh, nothing.

50:33.364 --> 50:35.156
Come on, what?

50:38.661 --> 50:42.413
If you don't try something new,
you get stuck.

50:43.415 --> 50:46.668
Huh? Trying too hard is much lamer.

50:47.002 --> 50:49.546
That's so like you, Haruko!

50:50.714 --> 50:52.257
Meaning what?

50:52.841 --> 50:57.345
Listen, I tried lots of new things,
and settled on this.

50:57.471 --> 50:59.973
Alright alright, I get it.

51:00.099 --> 51:02.517
Anyway, you hungry too?

51:09.984 --> 51:11.609
I'm gonna say it.

51:13.237 --> 51:17.740
Listen, Yuko can't handle
being "produced" by you.

51:18.367 --> 51:19.576
"Produced"?

51:20.411 --> 51:24.998
That old habit of yours.
You try to package everything.

51:25.958 --> 51:29.043
What, you came all this way to fight?

51:29.712 --> 51:31.754
No! I just...

51:39.972 --> 51:41.389
Maybe I did.

51:42.725 --> 51:44.726
Maybe I came to fight.

51:50.190 --> 51:54.360
Look, Tomoyo, you got famous
thanks to my fried rice.

51:56.864 --> 51:58.865
So sorry about that!

52:01.535 --> 52:05.204
After all, it was my idea.
Your Hah-chan rice.

52:05.331 --> 52:09.417
The idea came from
our plans for a restaurant!

52:09.543 --> 52:14.213
You didn't care about cooking.
Now you're Top Chef.

52:14.340 --> 52:16.799
I am not!

52:17.468 --> 52:19.469
What? Are you jealous?

52:19.970 --> 52:21.888
Not one little bit.

52:22.014 --> 52:25.475
Why would you be?
It was you who betrayed me.

52:30.189 --> 52:34.817
I'm leaving, came here too late.

52:35.652 --> 52:37.111
Not so fast.

52:38.280 --> 52:39.864
Sorry to bother you.

52:39.865 --> 52:42.283
Not so fast! Take this!

52:49.875 --> 52:51.167
Tomoyo?!

52:51.543 --> 52:52.377
What, what?

52:52.503 --> 52:53.920
My back...

52:54.046 --> 52:55.880
Your back? Why...

52:56.256 --> 52:57.840
Your back..

52:58.133 --> 53:01.678
Tomoyo! You threw
your back out again?!

53:02.388 --> 53:04.722
I should've helped you!

53:05.808 --> 53:09.519
What now? Call an ambulance?
Too much?

53:09.645 --> 53:12.021
Just leave, okay?!

53:14.274 --> 53:18.945
No, I can't!
I want to, but I can't!

53:19.196 --> 53:21.823
What about tomorrow's TV shoot?!

53:28.747 --> 53:33.501
Shiso leaves? Where?
Oh, ohba leaves?

53:33.836 --> 53:35.044
Isn't that takuan?

53:35.170 --> 53:37.255
"Midsummer Regret" flavor?

53:37.381 --> 53:38.548
What's that?

53:38.674 --> 53:41.259
Whatever, just look forward to it.

53:41.385 --> 53:43.761
They're surprisingly authentic.

53:44.054 --> 53:46.055
Had your band recording?

53:46.432 --> 53:48.099
It went really well.

53:48.225 --> 53:49.684
Can I hear it?

53:50.602 --> 53:52.770
I'm not done mixing it.

53:52.896 --> 53:55.356
Okay, fried fish tacos.

53:56.817 --> 53:58.776
I can't wait.

53:59.403 --> 54:01.404
Chef's special for me.

54:01.655 --> 54:03.281
I should've had that!

54:03.407 --> 54:05.908
- Have some of mine.
- Yay!

54:07.161 --> 54:11.581
A young guy like you liking
Chocolate Sleepover is so rare!

54:12.291 --> 54:14.375
I'm... not the only one.

54:15.419 --> 54:16.794
What did you do?

54:17.087 --> 54:19.422
I was chorus and melodica.

54:20.174 --> 54:24.093
Melodica as an homage
to their song "Tender One"?

54:24.636 --> 54:26.429
Oh, you know it?

54:26.555 --> 54:29.849
I knew it!
That's such a classy choice!

54:30.225 --> 54:31.726
Wow, you noticed?!

54:31.852 --> 54:35.062
Man, I wish I was in a band too.

54:35.189 --> 54:39.567
Riku, I had a great time.
Maybe bands are my thing.

54:40.360 --> 54:42.487
Thanks for inviting me.

54:43.197 --> 54:44.655
Thank you too.

54:47.034 --> 54:48.785
Hope you see their show.

54:52.331 --> 54:56.417
By the way, the people
at HA9 want you to drop by.

54:56.543 --> 54:58.419
You want to work there?

54:58.795 --> 55:02.048
Yeah, I told them!
They remembered...

55:02.466 --> 55:03.841
You're an intern?

55:04.426 --> 55:10.056
Yes. I can't go into detail yet,
but I'm working on a team now.

55:10.182 --> 55:12.600
For real? Wow!

55:13.018 --> 55:14.560
Want to go tomorrow?

55:14.686 --> 55:16.395
Huh? Yeah!

55:17.523 --> 55:18.689
You'll come too?

55:20.692 --> 55:22.360
I don't think so.

55:24.446 --> 55:26.072
You'll really go?

55:26.573 --> 55:29.492
I want to. Won't you?

55:30.661 --> 55:33.704
Why would I?
They suck.

55:44.633 --> 55:45.842
Sorao!

55:48.011 --> 55:50.096
These tacos are awesome.

55:50.722 --> 55:53.349
Glad to hear it. Enjoy.

55:53.684 --> 55:55.142
Yeah. Let's eat!

55:55.769 --> 55:58.104
Sorao, what do you recommend?

55:59.940 --> 56:02.567
"Midsummer Regret," perhaps?

56:03.569 --> 56:04.986
Get over yourself.

56:28.260 --> 56:30.553
You're not doing anything!

56:30.679 --> 56:33.598
Standing up is hard enough!

56:34.516 --> 56:35.933
Don't lean on me!

56:36.393 --> 56:41.230
That take was okay!
Next is a closeup of Haruko's hands!

56:54.578 --> 56:56.287
Haruko, be aggressive.

56:58.040 --> 56:59.498
Aggressive.

57:01.835 --> 57:03.586
Don't produce me!

57:03.962 --> 57:05.338
Good. More!

57:05.464 --> 57:06.464
Shut up!

57:10.052 --> 57:12.011
Whoa..

57:16.141 --> 57:20.227
Next is Tomoyo sharpening a knife,
for atmosphere.

57:21.021 --> 57:23.397
What a weird atmosphere...

57:23.649 --> 57:26.859
"Japanese aesthetics,"
or something.

57:27.778 --> 57:32.239
This is all about nurturing creativity.

57:32.491 --> 57:34.909
Oh, you don't say?

57:38.664 --> 57:41.832
Tomoyo does minor stuff like this too?

57:42.584 --> 57:47.380
This is a big production
streamed to 135 countries.

57:48.173 --> 57:50.967
World's End Cooking, Season 4.

57:51.218 --> 57:54.720
No way!
I never miss an episode!

58:03.855 --> 58:06.190
Very sorry!

58:25.252 --> 58:27.795
Those flowers aren't cutting it.

58:30.298 --> 58:32.299
Better without purple?

58:35.345 --> 58:36.512
Like this?

58:40.892 --> 58:41.892
Or this?

58:48.567 --> 58:51.736
Sorry. Plastic flowers are a no-go.

58:58.493 --> 59:01.954
Um... so... the thing is..

59:13.467 --> 59:15.676
Tomoyo, how are these?

59:34.696 --> 59:35.821
Perfect!

59:36.823 --> 59:38.324
Yes!

1:00:17.072 --> 1:00:23.452
"One day until deadline"

1:01:08.248 --> 1:01:10.416
Oh, thanks!

1:01:11.376 --> 1:01:13.294
Looks great.

1:01:22.470 --> 1:01:24.430
Bless this food.

1:01:36.943 --> 1:01:38.444
Really good.

1:01:39.446 --> 1:01:40.863
It is.

1:01:43.909 --> 1:01:45.910
The crew were so pleased.

1:01:46.786 --> 1:01:48.746
Glad to hear it.

1:01:58.840 --> 1:02:00.841
I thought it was a facade.

1:02:04.679 --> 1:02:10.059
You look impressive on TV,
but I thought it'd all be fake.

1:02:12.020 --> 1:02:16.482
Sorry. I wanted you to be that way.

1:02:20.487 --> 1:02:25.824
But... I realized when
I walked into your restaurant.

1:02:27.327 --> 1:02:30.955
"Wow, I love this place."

1:02:32.916 --> 1:02:36.293
I could see why others love it too.

1:02:47.180 --> 1:02:48.013
What?

1:02:48.431 --> 1:02:51.725
Back back back.
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1:02:51.851 --> 1:02:55.521
I'll sit when I'm ready.
I'll do it slowly.

1:02:55.730 --> 1:02:57.398
I can do it.

1:02:59.025 --> 1:03:01.568
Lucky Yuko's not here.

1:03:02.445 --> 1:03:04.029
Why is that lucky?

1:03:04.155 --> 1:03:07.241
I can't let her see me look pathetic.

1:03:15.709 --> 1:03:20.796
Honestly, I haven't spoken properly
with her for six months.

1:03:22.507 --> 1:03:24.174
I thought so.

1:03:25.260 --> 1:03:27.469
I didn't want to argue.

1:03:29.014 --> 1:03:30.848
That's just silly.

1:03:33.143 --> 1:03:36.395
I just can't figure her out lately.

1:03:39.441 --> 1:03:44.903
Lately, Yuko went to a party in Tokyo.

1:03:45.655 --> 1:03:46.989
What's that?

1:03:50.910 --> 1:03:52.036
See?

1:03:56.708 --> 1:03:58.208
She looks grown-up.

1:03:58.918 --> 1:04:01.170
Because she's growing up.

1:04:04.257 --> 1:04:05.591
Cute, right?

1:04:05.925 --> 1:04:07.426
It suits her.

1:04:09.596 --> 1:04:11.305
Is that her dress?

1:04:11.431 --> 1:04:13.057
I lent it to her.

1:04:18.772 --> 1:04:20.064
Sorry.

1:04:21.399 --> 1:04:24.360
You came to work,
but I was too busy.

1:04:24.486 --> 1:04:26.320
No, it's fine, really.

1:04:26.446 --> 1:04:29.782
On today of all days,
I really messed up.

1:04:29.908 --> 1:04:32.493
Yeah, I felt bad for you.

1:04:33.411 --> 1:04:37.206
It was my fault, but
they fixed it for me.

1:04:37.624 --> 1:04:39.375
Oh..

1:04:39.501 --> 1:04:41.210
Well, they're pros.

1:04:41.586 --> 1:04:48.550
They tell me I'm part of
their team too, but I'm totally not.

1:04:49.761 --> 1:04:51.970
I'm a high schooler.

1:04:53.389 --> 1:04:55.057
So I got sent home.

1:04:57.227 --> 1:05:00.270
I say I'm an intern,

1:05:01.189 --> 1:05:03.190
but this is reality.

1:05:04.234 --> 1:05:08.028
You're amazing.
You edited images.

1:05:08.905 --> 1:05:11.240
And bought takeout coffee.

1:05:12.158 --> 1:05:13.784
You did your best.

1:05:15.703 --> 1:05:18.205
I did tasks anybody could do.

1:05:21.126 --> 1:05:25.045
But it's impressive.
You worked with grownups.

1:05:28.466 --> 1:05:30.217
I want to grow up.

1:05:50.113 --> 1:05:51.572
You were crying..

1:05:51.865 --> 1:05:53.407
Wait, what?

1:05:56.578 --> 1:05:58.328
Wipe your tears.

1:06:02.041 --> 1:06:03.417
This is...

1:06:03.626 --> 1:06:06.128
Oh! My lunchbox wrapper.

1:06:07.005 --> 1:06:08.380
Smells of tacos?

1:06:09.048 --> 1:06:10.340
A little.

1:06:12.760 --> 1:06:16.346
Wouldn't a handkerchief be more normal?

1:06:17.307 --> 1:06:18.640
Normally.

1:06:22.437 --> 1:06:23.645
Thanks.

1:06:35.158 --> 1:06:37.993
I want medicine to speed up time.

1:06:38.203 --> 1:06:39.828
Freaky medicine.

1:06:40.455 --> 1:06:44.458
You swallow it, and five years go by.

1:06:45.501 --> 1:06:48.504
Five years for you only?

1:06:48.671 --> 1:06:49.671
Yeah.

1:06:49.797 --> 1:06:51.048
And the world?

1:06:51.966 --> 1:06:54.259
That's a good question.

1:06:55.553 --> 1:06:58.639
Let me think it over for homework.

1:07:06.272 --> 1:07:08.190
Five years, huh..

1:07:12.278 --> 1:07:15.155
Yuko, what do you want to be?

1:07:16.032 --> 1:07:18.242
Hmm, you're asking me now?

1:07:19.410 --> 1:07:20.744
I want to know.

1:07:25.333 --> 1:07:27.334
That'll be my homework.

1:07:40.890 --> 1:07:42.391
I'd better go.

1:07:43.685 --> 1:07:44.726
See you.

1:07:44.852 --> 1:07:46.144
Hey...

1:07:49.774 --> 1:07:52.609
Don't tell Akane anything, okay?

1:07:56.739 --> 1:08:00.242
I won't, I won't.
It was just a joke.

1:08:03.288 --> 1:08:06.248
Okay, see you at school.

1:08:07.917 --> 1:08:09.251
Bye bye.

1:08:15.842 --> 1:08:17.593
You didn't submit it?!

1:08:18.678 --> 1:08:22.681
Well, the other bands
were way too good.

1:08:23.391 --> 1:08:25.058
Real pros.

1:08:26.269 --> 1:08:30.230
Our song would just get
slammed by fans.

1:08:30.440 --> 1:08:33.567
We'd get known
in a way we don't want.

1:08:33.735 --> 1:08:37.029
If we get known, who cares what we want?

1:08:37.155 --> 1:08:39.990
We won't know till we submit it.

1:08:40.325 --> 1:08:44.703
She's right.
Are you outta your mind?

1:08:46.331 --> 1:08:50.667
We put our hearts into it.
I don't want it criticized.

1:08:51.669 --> 1:08:54.129
That's not for you to decide.

1:08:55.381 --> 1:08:56.715
Sorry.

1:09:11.856 --> 1:09:13.231
Ready to order?

1:09:13.399 --> 1:09:15.275
Hah-chan rice for two.

1:09:15.568 --> 1:09:16.985
With drinks?

1:09:17.362 --> 1:09:18.528
Beer.

1:09:19.405 --> 1:09:21.657
Thank you.
One moment please.

1:09:22.158 --> 1:09:24.910
Two Hah-chans, two beers!

1:09:25.036 --> 1:09:26.620
Okay, two Hah-chans!

1:09:26.746 --> 1:09:29.456
Hello! Please sit at the back.

1:09:29.624 --> 1:09:30.749
Don't tell me...

1:09:30.875 --> 1:09:32.584
I threw my back out.

1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:36.296
Kosuke! Table 6's order.

1:09:39.759 --> 1:09:41.551
Thank you for waiting!

1:09:41.677 --> 1:09:44.429
Kosuke! Register please.

1:09:54.440 --> 1:09:56.650
Yudai, where's Yuko?

1:09:57.985 --> 1:09:59.736
She hasn't come.

1:10:00.405 --> 1:10:01.822
You know something.

1:10:02.365 --> 1:10:03.990
I don't.

1:10:04.242 --> 1:10:05.492
Really?

1:10:05.702 --> 1:10:07.160
I don't!

1:10:08.538 --> 1:10:09.538
Really...

1:10:37.024 --> 1:10:40.444
"Akane:
Where are you?"

1:10:45.450 --> 1:10:47.701
So, you 're not really sick?

1:10:50.538 --> 1:10:51.872
Sorry.

1:10:54.333 --> 1:10:56.793
Problem with your internship?

1:10:56.919 --> 1:11:02.340
No. I'm glad I went.
I learned how pros work.

1:11:02.800 --> 1:11:04.760
You only went once.

1:11:04.886 --> 1:11:08.638
So what? You didn't go
so you don't know.

1:11:10.766 --> 1:11:14.728
And, I realized.
Prep school's not for me.

1:11:15.229 --> 1:11:18.023
Doing art for exams is no fun.

1:11:18.149 --> 1:11:19.566
Are you serious?

1:11:19.901 --> 1:11:23.361
I don't need art college either.

1:11:32.038 --> 1:11:36.917
You're right. You joined a band,
and became an intern.

1:11:37.502 --> 1:11:39.294
Lots of escape routes.

1:11:40.630 --> 1:11:41.797
They're not.

1:11:42.089 --> 1:11:44.508
You're scared of criticism.

1:11:45.927 --> 1:11:49.638
"It doesn't feel right"
is just an excuse.

1:12:02.068 --> 1:12:05.946
Our zine too.
You haven't done it for days.

1:12:06.072 --> 1:12:07.113
I've been busy.

1:12:07.240 --> 1:12:09.115
Prep school was Mom's idea?

1:12:09.242 --> 1:12:10.408
No!

1:12:15.039 --> 1:12:17.082
I've only got art college.

1:12:47.530 --> 1:12:51.908
"Chocolate Sleepover comeback concert
Today 7 p.m."

1:13:00.585 --> 1:13:03.003
Okay, I'll head home now.

1:13:05.131 --> 1:13:08.508
Tomoyo should be
back from hospital soon.

1:13:08.634 --> 1:13:10.552
Got it. Thanks.

1:13:14.849 --> 1:13:17.434
Haruko, are you really leaving?!

1:13:18.936 --> 1:13:21.938
After I say goodbye to Tomoyo.

1:13:22.231 --> 1:13:26.359
Oh heck...
Oh heckity heck...

1:13:26.569 --> 1:13:29.487
Come on, I can't stay forever.

1:13:29.614 --> 1:13:33.575
But Tomoyo's a lot
happier with you here!

1:13:33.701 --> 1:13:36.953
Without you, our lives'll be empty!

1:13:39.457 --> 1:13:41.917
Thanks. I'll be back.

1:13:45.046 --> 1:13:47.505
Alright. Thank you so much..

1:15:34.405 --> 1:15:35.780
Prep school?

1:15:38.743 --> 1:15:40.118
I quit.

1:15:46.292 --> 1:15:47.584
Our song?

1:15:53.007 --> 1:15:54.549
Didn't send it.

1:15:58.888 --> 1:16:00.597
Oh right.

1:16:14.111 --> 1:16:17.864
Sorry I can't
take you to the show.

1:16:48.896 --> 1:16:50.730
I'm back...

1:16:54.819 --> 1:16:57.529
I took a look inside.

1:17:01.283 --> 1:17:03.660
Relics of our misspent youth.

1:17:04.954 --> 1:17:08.623
They're ours,
so I kept them all this time.

1:17:08.749 --> 1:17:11.334
No wonder you wrecked your back.

1:17:13.254 --> 1:17:18.424
This is so cringey.
That unit we formed together.

1:17:19.343 --> 1:17:21.136
The Pens!

1:17:21.262 --> 1:17:22.095
So lame!

1:17:22.221 --> 1:17:23.972
We didn't care.

1:17:24.098 --> 1:17:27.559
Our unofficial
Chocolate Sleepover special.

1:17:27.685 --> 1:17:29.144
Those were the days.

1:17:29.270 --> 1:17:31.354
Oh, their show's today.

1:17:32.314 --> 1:17:34.732
I don't want to see old Recman.

1:17:34.859 --> 1:17:36.442
Me neither!

1:17:38.404 --> 1:17:42.073
And this is the cringiest of all.

1:17:47.121 --> 1:17:50.707
We're back again this week!
The Pens on the Radio!

1:17:50.833 --> 1:17:52.667
I'm your host, Haruko!

1:17:52.793 --> 1:17:55.044
And I'm Tomoyo! Hi!

1:17:56.547 --> 1:17:58.339
I can't, I can't!

1:17:58.674 --> 1:18:00.216
It's hard to bear!

1:18:00.426 --> 1:18:02.343
So young and so dumb.

1:18:02.469 --> 1:18:07.473
But that was us then,
and now we're us now.

1:18:07.600 --> 1:18:08.266
True.

1:18:08.392 --> 1:18:10.143
Give us an update.

1:18:10.394 --> 1:18:15.732
I've been writing a magazine column,
and drawing illustrations.

1:18:16.275 --> 1:18:22.572
I've also started designing recently.
Flyers, and t-shirts as well.

1:18:23.157 --> 1:18:25.658
I'm producing 24 hours a day!

1:18:25.784 --> 1:18:28.161
Wow, creative!

1:18:29.288 --> 1:18:36.211
I'm also busy hunting down cool places
and talking to cool people!

1:18:36.337 --> 1:18:41.341
I can never let Yuko hear this.
I'll take it to the grave.

1:18:44.720 --> 1:18:45.887
What?

1:18:46.347 --> 1:18:48.848
I just sent it to her.

1:18:59.234 --> 1:19:04.530
But Tomoyo, aren't you
taking on way too much?

1:19:04.782 --> 1:19:06.824
Am I too fickle?

1:19:06.951 --> 1:19:08.451
Mom?

1:19:09.286 --> 1:19:14.832
But I try everything wholeheartedly.
Always full throttle!

1:19:15.125 --> 1:19:17.293
That's you!

1:19:17.544 --> 1:19:20.964
Right? I'm consistent
about being inconsistent.

1:19:21.090 --> 1:19:25.468
So, industry people,
come and find me!

1:19:25.594 --> 1:19:27.136
Hear that?

1:19:27.638 --> 1:19:31.307
I'm right here waiting!
Can you hear me?!

1:19:31.433 --> 1:19:32.433
Want one?

1:19:32.685 --> 1:19:33.768
I want one.

1:19:33.894 --> 1:19:35.770
Tell us your ambitions.

1:19:35.896 --> 1:19:42.026
First, I'll open a swanky restaurant
with my pal Haruko.

1:19:42.778 --> 1:19:43.987
Then what?

1:19:44.279 --> 1:19:46.322
A regular column.

1:19:46.448 --> 1:19:47.657
Then what?

1:19:48.534 --> 1:19:50.660
Marriage, for example

1:19:50.786 --> 1:19:52.412
Hard to imagine.

1:19:52.538 --> 1:19:53.454
Kids?

1:19:53.580 --> 1:19:57.000
Even harder to imagine.
I'm not cut out to be a mom.

1:19:57.126 --> 1:20:01.587
How do you know? What kind of mom
would you want to be?

1:20:02.089 --> 1:20:04.048
Me? I don't know.

1:20:05.467 --> 1:20:08.261
I want to be an admirable woman,

1:20:08.387 --> 1:20:14.350
with a career, media and
political insight, and fashion sense.

1:20:14.560 --> 1:20:15.810
You're so self-absorbed!

1:20:15.936 --> 1:20:20.690
I'd love it if my child thought,
"My mom's so cool."

1:20:20.983 --> 1:20:23.901
And I'd hug them really tightly.

1:20:24.028 --> 1:20:31.034
That's a good mom. Okay,
say a message to your future child.

1:20:31.160 --> 1:20:32.994
Huh? A message?

1:20:37.666 --> 1:20:39.667
Hey, let's go to a song!

1:20:39.793 --> 1:20:41.169
You coward!

1:20:41.295 --> 1:20:45.423
Chocolate Sleepover's
"This Won't Do"!

1:20:58.771 --> 1:20:59.854
Riku!

1:21:01.482 --> 1:21:04.025
I asked you to knock.

1:21:23.045 --> 1:21:27.256
When a cool mother
shows her immature and lame side,

1:21:27.424 --> 1:21:29.884
it gives their child hope.

1:22:31.113 --> 1:22:34.365
Hey! You came after all!

1:22:35.117 --> 1:22:38.995
I was hoping to listen
inside, not outside.

1:22:40.664 --> 1:22:41.914
Yo.

1:22:43.125 --> 1:22:44.834
Yo my butt.

1:22:48.755 --> 1:22:50.173
Sorry.

1:22:51.633 --> 1:22:55.470
Sorry isn't enough, but...

1:23:08.358 --> 1:23:11.027
I guess we can't hear it out here.

1:23:23.874 --> 1:23:28.503
My mom...
isn't as perfect as I thought.

1:23:28.921 --> 1:23:30.546
She's fickle too.

1:23:32.382 --> 1:23:36.427
Even so, she fought her own battles.

1:23:37.095 --> 1:23:39.847
She always took her best shot.

1:23:43.560 --> 1:23:47.939
So, even if something
feels inadequate and lame,

1:23:48.232 --> 1:23:52.860
you should put it out there...
I think.

1:23:53.987 --> 1:23:55.404
I'm sure.

1:24:07.042 --> 1:24:08.543
I want to.

1:24:10.629 --> 1:24:15.007
I want to try again with all of you.

1:24:19.596 --> 1:24:20.888
I do.

1:24:22.057 --> 1:24:27.728
The deadline's passed.
The concert's nearly over too.

1:24:29.064 --> 1:24:30.773
You're a lost cause.

1:24:33.527 --> 1:24:35.027
Say it.

1:24:36.822 --> 1:24:37.947
Say it.

1:24:39.783 --> 1:24:41.284
Hurry.

1:24:41.576 --> 1:24:43.619
Also, Yuko..

1:24:46.081 --> 1:24:48.583
Would you sing lead this time?

1:24:50.377 --> 1:24:54.714
Well, your voice is perfect
for the song's image...

1:25:24.870 --> 1:25:26.537
You're late!

1:25:26.663 --> 1:25:28.414
Sorry, sorry.

1:25:31.126 --> 1:25:33.544
Okay, let's do this.

1:25:42.971 --> 1:25:44.972
I like it! But,

1:25:45.140 --> 1:25:49.518
if we're changing the lyrics,
will it still be a cover?

1:25:49.936 --> 1:25:52.938
Who cares?
Let's make what we want.

1:25:53.065 --> 1:25:54.231
Agreed!

1:25:54.358 --> 1:25:57.151
This needs to be one or the other.

1:25:57.277 --> 1:25:59.445
Yeah, it's important...

1:26:19.257 --> 1:26:21.092
Don't do that!

1:26:33.730 --> 1:26:35.564
Let's get outta here!

1:26:36.274 --> 1:26:38.776
It's okay! It's okay!

1:26:42.656 --> 1:26:43.989
Here goes.

1:26:53.166 --> 1:26:55.376
My eyes, my eyes..

1:26:55.627 --> 1:26:56.836
Dad?!

1:26:57.963 --> 1:27:00.715
You guys inspired me to play again.

1:27:04.845 --> 1:27:06.429
My eyes, my eyes...

1:27:10.517 --> 1:27:13.853
That was scary.
I thought my heart'd stop.

1:27:18.692 --> 1:27:22.486
Look. The plan for our own restaurant.

1:27:24.322 --> 1:27:28.325
We put so much thought into
what we wanted to do.

1:27:29.035 --> 1:27:30.870
We talked for ages.

1:27:34.249 --> 1:27:36.250
This is nothing like it.

1:27:37.627 --> 1:27:39.336
Nothing like it.

1:27:51.725 --> 1:27:53.100
Tomoyo.

1:28:02.611 --> 1:28:06.363
I'm sorry...
I didn't go that day.

1:28:13.872 --> 1:28:17.708
We did so much
preparation together, but...

1:28:22.756 --> 1:28:26.217
You didn't come to look at the premises.

1:28:34.267 --> 1:28:39.855
Back then...
I chickened out.

1:28:57.332 --> 1:28:59.083
Okay, let's do it.

1:28:59.376 --> 1:29:00.292
All good?

1:29:00.669 --> 1:29:01.585
Yeah.

1:29:02.003 --> 1:29:03.128
I'm ready.

1:29:03.463 --> 1:29:05.047
Okay here too!

1:29:08.218 --> 1:29:09.385
Recording.

1:29:35.328 --> 1:29:39.290
That time I said bye bye
I remember

1:29:39.416 --> 1:29:42.751
I just can't help regretting

1:29:43.420 --> 1:29:47.423
I hid my sadness
and said bye bye

1:29:47.549 --> 1:29:51.385
Truth is,
fear's what I was feeling

1:29:52.721 --> 1:29:55.097
I've regretted that so much.

1:29:55.807 --> 1:30:00.519
If I'd stuck by you back then,

1:30:00.770 --> 1:30:05.900
I'd be doing it with you now.
I thought that sometimes.

1:30:07.694 --> 1:30:11.530
What's gonna be our future?

1:30:11.948 --> 1:30:15.743
Adults don't know either

1:30:16.036 --> 1:30:19.663
Ghosts are what we'll become

1:30:20.040 --> 1:30:23.584
Nobody's alarm is turned on

1:30:24.044 --> 1:30:29.840
Won't you let me see
how this all turns out?

1:30:43.146 --> 1:30:44.313
Still..

1:30:47.484 --> 1:30:53.280
This isn't the future I imagined,
but it's grown on me.

1:30:56.868 --> 1:30:58.410
I'm not bluffing.

1:31:00.205 --> 1:31:02.414
Yeah. I know.

1:31:08.213 --> 1:31:13.509
Maybe I'll open a restaurant.
I always wanted to.

1:31:13.718 --> 1:31:15.219
Great idea.

1:31:16.054 --> 1:31:18.138
Never too late, right?

1:31:18.807 --> 1:31:20.265
You bet.

1:31:21.685 --> 1:31:23.602
Hey, I can't drink now!

1:31:23.728 --> 1:31:25.604
Okay, cheers!

1:31:26.106 --> 1:31:27.523
Cheers.

1:31:36.116 --> 1:31:37.449
I'll upload it.

1:31:44.374 --> 1:31:45.624
It's up.

1:31:45.750 --> 1:31:47.751
I've got butterflies.

1:31:47.877 --> 1:31:49.461
Any comments yet?

1:31:49.587 --> 1:31:51.255
Not yet, surely.

1:31:51.423 --> 1:31:52.965
Probably not.

1:31:56.761 --> 1:31:57.803
I'm so nervous!

1:31:57.929 --> 1:32:00.014
Hope it gets lots of plays.

1:32:06.521 --> 1:32:08.564
Bye bye. Take care.

1:32:09.816 --> 1:32:11.233
Okay, see you.

1:32:21.578 --> 1:32:23.996
Hey...

1:32:23.997 --> 1:32:27.624
Want to walk the long way
listening to this?

1:32:28.668 --> 1:32:34.131
Oh, sorry. There's something
I need to finish.

1:32:34.883 --> 1:32:36.216
I'd better go.

1:33:05.371 --> 1:33:06.830
Don't!

1:33:06.956 --> 1:33:08.373
No getting away.

1:33:08.500 --> 1:33:09.249
I can't!

1:33:09.375 --> 1:33:12.461
Come on,
a message to your child!

1:33:12.629 --> 1:33:17.424
Well... Well...
I haven't got any message!

1:33:17.550 --> 1:33:20.344
But, but...

1:33:24.265 --> 1:33:29.103
Whatever you're going through there,

1:33:29.521 --> 1:33:34.191
whomever you've met,
tell me when you get back.

1:33:40.114 --> 1:33:43.158
Let's talk. The End!

1:33:44.786 --> 1:33:46.328
The End!

1:33:47.497 --> 1:33:49.623
Cut! Okay!

1:35:31.476 --> 1:35:32.976
Ready, go!

1:35:42.612 --> 1:35:47.908
I like making art after all, even though
I suck, and our teacher sucks.

1:35:50.536 --> 1:35:55.123
This summer, I wanted to
find one thing I could stick with,

1:35:56.584 --> 1:35:58.669
but there's more than one.

1:36:00.630 --> 1:36:03.340
Like the band, and YouTube.

1:36:03.508 --> 1:36:07.010
You praised my writing,
so I'll do that too.

1:36:07.387 --> 1:36:11.056
I'll do it all!
And maybe more.

1:36:12.600 --> 1:36:13.934
Greedy.

1:36:19.023 --> 1:36:21.441
I did want to be an intern.

1:36:21.901 --> 1:36:22.985
You did?

1:36:23.319 --> 1:36:26.488
I envied how you
try without hesitating.

1:36:45.091 --> 1:36:48.260
Akane, bet I can
hold my breath longer.

1:36:48.511 --> 1:36:49.970
No thanks.

1:36:50.138 --> 1:36:52.431
Come on! Ready, go!

1:36:58.563 --> 1:37:02.232
I want to talk with my mom so much.

1:37:04.027 --> 1:37:06.945
Good for you.
About what?

1:37:08.364 --> 1:37:10.615
About my new friend.

1:37:24.589 --> 1:37:26.423
I brought my homework.

1:37:28.342 --> 1:37:32.804
I can't help wanting to be
something different every day.

1:37:33.931 --> 1:37:37.017
I used to hate myself a lot for that,

1:37:38.561 --> 1:37:41.521
but now I know for sure it's okay.

1:37:45.151 --> 1:37:48.945
So, Yudai Seo.
See you in a few years' time.

1:37:49.989 --> 1:37:51.990
I'll be cooler then.

1:37:54.285 --> 1:37:56.578
Why say my full name?

1:37:57.288 --> 1:37:59.790
You'll see me at the exam venue?

1:38:02.085 --> 1:38:03.293
Bye bye.

1:38:17.517 --> 1:38:19.142
Thank you so much.

1:38:20.853 --> 1:38:22.145
All the best.

1:38:24.023 --> 1:38:26.358
Yuko, come back sometime.

1:38:26.943 --> 1:38:29.111
Haruko..

1:38:30.363 --> 1:38:32.364
Give my best to Tomoyo.

1:38:32.615 --> 1:38:33.615
I will.

1:38:36.160 --> 1:38:37.911
Thank you too, Riku.

1:38:51.259 --> 1:38:52.926
Summer is ending.

1:38:54.220 --> 1:38:56.304
I'll keep doing my homework.

1:38:57.890 --> 1:39:01.226
I might have to make a choice one day,

1:39:01.769 --> 1:39:04.438
but for now I choose not to.

1:39:10.736 --> 1:39:12.571
Listened to the demo?

1:39:13.197 --> 1:39:15.449
Yeah, it could use some more work...

1:39:15.575 --> 1:39:17.159
What do you know?

1:39:17.285 --> 1:39:20.954
It's brilliant! Shut up, you.
It's the best!

1:39:21.289 --> 1:39:23.206
No fighting.

1:39:36.762 --> 1:39:41.308
Sure, thank you.
Two Hah-chan rice, one noodle salad!

1:39:42.560 --> 1:39:43.643
Coming!

1:39:44.562 --> 1:39:46.062
Here he comes..

1:39:47.607 --> 1:39:49.608
There! The Taco Kid!

1:39:53.446 --> 1:39:55.405
Hope he gets popular.

1:40:40.618 --> 1:40:41.785
Now then..

1:40:44.914 --> 1:40:46.957
Bless this food.

1:40:49.669 --> 1:40:57.050
AROUND THE TABLE

1:41:03.808 --> 1:41:05.559
3, 2, 1!

1:41:22.618 --> 1:41:26.538
That time I said bye bye
I remember

1:41:26.664 --> 1:41:30.333
I just can't help regretting

1:41:30.459 --> 1:41:34.629
I hid my melancholy
and said bye bye

1:41:34.755 --> 1:41:38.800
Truth is,
fear's what I was feeling

1:41:38.926 --> 1:41:46.933
Oh, is it normal
for this to come on so suddenly?

1:41:47.059 --> 1:41:52.272
When exactly did it all begin?

1:41:52.398 --> 1:41:54.691
Has it really begun?

1:41:54.817 --> 1:41:58.695
What's gonna be our future?

1:41:58.821 --> 1:42:03.283
Adults don't know either

1:42:03.409 --> 1:42:07.287
Ghosts are what we'll become

1:42:07.413 --> 1:42:11.333
Nobody's alarm is turned on

1:42:11.459 --> 1:42:18.673
Won't you let me see
how this all turns out?

1:42:31.854 --> 1:42:34.189
It started with Riku's
"Knock knock"

1:42:34.315 --> 1:42:36.066
My dream goes tick tock

1:42:36.192 --> 1:42:39.444
Changing, chopping
Like a beat that rocks

1:42:39.570 --> 1:42:41.363
We're way past deadline

1:42:41.489 --> 1:42:43.156
But we smile just fine

1:42:43.282 --> 1:42:45.075
Determined, we've become

1:42:45.201 --> 1:42:47.619
Right now's the most fun

1:42:47.745 --> 1:42:49.579
Something shined far away

1:42:49.705 --> 1:42:51.539
I saw it through the haze

1:42:51.665 --> 1:42:53.583
Let's take that direction

1:42:53.709 --> 1:42:55.585
Singing and progressing

1:42:55.711 --> 1:42:57.253
Ready? Feeling steady?

1:42:57.380 --> 1:42:59.964
One session only
Let's play freely

1:43:00.091 --> 1:43:01.925
If that ghost is bored

1:43:02.051 --> 1:43:04.344
Let's jump in, all aboard

1:43:04.470 --> 1:43:12.477
Oh, is it normal
for this to come on so suddenly?

1:43:12.603 --> 1:43:17.816
When exactly did it all begin?

1:43:17.942 --> 1:43:20.360
Has it really begun?

1:43:53.227 --> 1:43:57.105
What's gonna be our future?

1:43:57.231 --> 1:44:01.276
Adults don't know either

1:44:01.402 --> 1:44:05.280
Ghosts are what we'll become

1:44:05.406 --> 1:44:09.325
Nobody's alarm is turned on

1:44:09.452 --> 1:44:14.998
Won't you let me see
how this all turns out?
