WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:07.778
PREVIOUSLY ON TWISTED...

00:07.778 --> 00:09.210
IT'S NOT LIKE I LIE AROUND

00:09.210 --> 00:10.581
WISHING I COULD HANG
WITH YOU

00:10.581 --> 00:12.113
AND YOUR LAME
SUPERFICIAL FRIENDS ANYWAY.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.384
I DON'T BLAME
YOU FOR ANYTHING.

00:13.384 --> 00:15.216
THEN WHY DID YOU
CALL ME A BAD MOTHER?

00:15.216 --> 00:16.647
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BLEND IN HERE.

00:16.647 --> 00:18.119
YOU MIGHT AS WELL ACCEPT THAT.

00:18.119 --> 00:19.550
I JOINED THE SOCCER TEAM.

00:19.550 --> 00:21.152
WHY DID YOU
MOVE THAT PICTURE?

00:21.152 --> 00:22.153
I'M TRYING TO START OVER.

00:22.153 --> 00:23.354
WHAT CHANCE DO I HAVE

00:23.354 --> 00:25.096
IF MY OWN MOM
DOESN'T BELIEVE ME?

00:25.096 --> 00:26.297
I DO.

00:26.297 --> 00:27.428
Sandy: WHERE ARE WE
WITH THE NECKLACE?

00:27.428 --> 00:29.100
GET LOST
FINDING THE BATHROOM?

00:29.100 --> 00:30.231
Rico: WAIT, I THOUGHT
YOU SAID ARCHIE

00:30.231 --> 00:31.562
WAS HOME THE NIGHT
OF REGINA'S PARTY.

00:31.562 --> 00:33.204
IF HE WAS HOME RESTING,
WHY DID HE NEED

00:33.204 --> 00:34.235
TO BORROW SCOTT'S CAR ALL NIGHT?

00:34.235 --> 00:35.566
WHY DID HE LIE ABOUT IT?

00:35.566 --> 00:37.037
HELLO, TARA.

00:52.223 --> 00:54.125
Kyle: PROOF IT AND
GET IT BACK TO ME.

00:56.587 --> 00:59.090
- JO, EVERYTHING OKAY?
- YEAH.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.232
YOU LEFT REALLY
EARLY THIS MORNING.

01:01.232 --> 01:02.633
SINCE WE'RE NO LONGER
CARPOOLING,

01:02.633 --> 01:04.095
I THOUGHT I'D START
COMING IN EARLIER,

01:04.095 --> 01:05.196
GET A JUMP
ON MY DAYS.

01:05.196 --> 01:07.298
WHAT'S UP?

01:07.298 --> 01:09.069
I HAVE TO ASK
YOU SOMETHING.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.771
IT'S A POLICE QUESTION.

01:10.771 --> 01:13.204
WELL...

01:13.204 --> 01:14.545
YOU CAME TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

01:15.846 --> 01:19.150
OKAY, SO IF YOU'RE
INVESTIGATING A CRIME

01:19.150 --> 01:20.781
AND SOMEONE LIED ABOUT
THEIR ALIBI,

01:20.781 --> 01:22.783
YOU'D WANT TO QUESTION
THEM AGAIN, RIGHT?

01:22.783 --> 01:24.755
MAYBE.

01:24.755 --> 01:26.117
SOMETIMES PEOPLE
LIE FOR REASONS

01:26.117 --> 01:27.618
THAT HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE CRIME.

01:27.618 --> 01:29.760
IS THIS ABOUT LACEY?

01:29.760 --> 01:31.422
WHAT? NO, IT'S ABOUT--

01:31.422 --> 01:32.863
I KNOW SHE WAS WITH
DANNY THAT NIGHT,

01:32.863 --> 01:34.865
ASLEEP.

01:34.865 --> 01:36.867
IT'S OKAY.
I GET IT.

01:36.867 --> 01:38.629
YOU WANTED TO PROTECT
YOUR FRIEND.

01:38.629 --> 01:40.301
LACEY'S NOT MY FRIEND.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.403
WHATEVER SHE LIES ABOUT
IS HER BUSINESS.

01:43.534 --> 01:45.576
IT'S ABOUT HER BOYFRIEND,
ACTUALLY.

01:45.576 --> 01:47.438
ARCHIE YATES?

01:47.438 --> 01:48.579
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HE LIED?

01:48.579 --> 01:50.881
I JUST HEARD IT
AROUND SCHOOL.

01:50.881 --> 01:53.844
I DON'T KNOW-- HE SAID
HE WAS AT HOME SLEEPING

01:53.844 --> 01:55.816
BUT I KNOW THAT HE WAS

01:55.816 --> 01:58.849
BORROWING SCOTT OGDEN'S CAR
BECAUSE SCOTT HAD TO GET A RIDE

01:58.849 --> 02:00.151
TO REGINA'S PARTY
WITH JANA

02:00.151 --> 02:01.892
AND THEN JANA
GOT ALL MAD AT HIM

02:01.892 --> 02:03.654
BECAUSE HE NEVER
CALLED HER BACK.

02:03.654 --> 02:05.356
AND...

02:05.356 --> 02:07.898
OKAY LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING IS
MAYBE JUST TALK TO ARCHIE AGAIN.

02:07.898 --> 02:09.530
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.862
ARCHIE YATES ISN'T
A SUSPECT RIGHT NOW.

02:11.862 --> 02:13.234
- BUT DAD, HE LIED--
- HAVE A GOOD DAY AT SCHOOL.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.905
STUDY HARD.

02:14.905 --> 02:16.407
GET MULTIPLE SCHOLARSHIPS.

02:27.578 --> 02:29.280
THIS LOOKS GOOD.

02:29.280 --> 02:30.621
SEND IT TO JUDGE DAVIS.

02:30.621 --> 02:32.783
I'LL FOLLOW UP WITH HIM
LATER ON TODAY.

02:32.783 --> 02:34.725
IT'S PRETTY CIRCUMSTANTIAL.
YOU THINK HE'LL BITE?

02:34.725 --> 02:36.787
TWO MURDER VICTIMS
WEARING THE SAME NECKLACE?

02:36.787 --> 02:38.189
IT'S AT LEAST ENOUGH
TO GET US A WARRANT

02:38.189 --> 02:39.190
TO SEARCH THE DESAI HOUSE.

02:39.190 --> 02:40.261
IF WE CAN GET THAT NECKLACE,

02:40.261 --> 02:41.662
MAYBE WE CAN WRAP
THIS ONE UP.

03:00.581 --> 03:01.952
Vikram: SO IT'S ONLY A VIOLATION

03:01.952 --> 03:03.854
TO BE IN A OFFSIDE POSITION
WHEN?

03:03.854 --> 03:05.616
WHEN YOU'RE
IN ACTIVE PLAY.

03:05.616 --> 03:07.388
- THAT'S MY BOY.
- THE GREENER GROVE

03:07.388 --> 03:09.890
CHARITY COMMITTEE
WILL BE HERE SOON.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.562
COULD YOU PLEASE PUT
A SHEET OVER THAT CHAIR?

03:11.562 --> 03:13.524
ONLY IF WE CAN COVER
THAT BROCADE NUMBER

03:13.524 --> 03:14.965
WITH THE LION FEET.

03:14.965 --> 03:17.298
I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S AN ANTIQUE,
BUT REALLY, KAREN...

03:17.298 --> 03:19.370
VIK, I AM SERIOUS.
THIS DOES NOT FIT.

03:19.370 --> 03:20.971
AT LEAST IT
HAS A PURPOSE:

03:20.971 --> 03:23.604
SLOT FOR THE REMOTE,
CUP HOLDER FOR MY BEER--

03:23.604 --> 03:25.876
OH, THANK YOU.

03:25.876 --> 03:27.678
AND SPACE FOR
TWO SOCCER FANS.

03:27.678 --> 03:29.240
RIGHT, DANNY?

03:29.240 --> 03:31.882
MOTHER, PLEASE,
YOU'RE BLOCKING THE REVS.

03:37.948 --> 03:39.650
Danny: IF THAT CHAIR
BOTHERS YOU,

03:39.650 --> 03:40.991
I CAN MOVE IT
INTO THE GARAGE.

03:40.991 --> 03:44.355
I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT
AFTER YOUR FATHER DIED.

03:44.355 --> 03:45.996
BUT I COULDN'T.

03:45.996 --> 03:47.428
HE--

03:47.428 --> 03:49.400
HE REALLY LOVED THIS
PIECE OF CRAP, DIDN'T HE?

03:49.400 --> 03:51.231
YEAH, HE REALLY DID.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.834
IT REMINDS ME OF YOU TWO
WATCHING SOCCER TOGETHER.

03:53.834 --> 03:56.967
HE ALWAYS SAID
YOU COULD PLAY

03:56.967 --> 03:58.569
PROFESSIONALLY ONE DAY.

03:58.569 --> 04:00.271
WAS THAT AFTER HIS FOURTH
OR HIS FIFTH BEER?

04:00.271 --> 04:02.773
STOP IT.

04:02.773 --> 04:04.515
HE WOULD BE
SO PROUD OF YOU.

04:04.515 --> 04:05.946
YOU'RE GONNA
DO GREAT TODAY.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.948
I HOPE I DON'T MAKE
TOO BIG A FOOL OF MYSELF.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.950
YOU WON'T.

04:28.999 --> 04:31.472
( theme playing )

04:37.708 --> 04:39.750
I HOPE TONIGHT WON'T
BE A HUGE MISTAKE.

04:39.750 --> 04:41.312
OKAY, PHOEBE AND SARITA

04:41.312 --> 04:42.753
HAVE NEVER REALLY
LIKED EACH OTHER.

04:42.753 --> 04:44.515
MAYBE THEY'RE JUST
NOT MEANT TO BE FRIENDS.

04:44.515 --> 04:46.286
THEY JUST NEED A NIGHT
TO BREAK THE ICE.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.458
A WHOLE NIGHT

04:47.458 --> 04:48.859
IN AN ENCLOSED
SPACE WITH PHOEBE.

04:48.859 --> 04:50.561
THAT MAKES ME WANT TO TAKE
A NAP JUST THINKING ABOUT IT.

04:50.561 --> 04:51.692
SHE'S NOT THAT BAD.

04:52.923 --> 04:54.895
I'M SURE IT'LL
BE ALL RIGHT.

04:55.896 --> 04:59.299
WE COULD USE A LITTLE LESS
TENSION AROUND SCHOOL.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.871
WELL, AS LONG AS
DANNY DE-PSYCHO GOES HERE,

05:00.871 --> 05:01.872
WE'RE TENSION CENTRAL.

05:01.872 --> 05:03.574
OKAY, COULD YOU PLEASE

05:03.574 --> 05:05.406
TRY NOT TO BEAT EACH OTHER UP
ON THE SOCCER FIELD TODAY.

05:05.406 --> 05:06.707
I WILL TRY.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.008
AT LEAST THE FREAK
WILL GIVE ME AND THE BOYS

05:08.008 --> 05:09.440
SOMETHING TO BOND OVER TONIGHT.

05:11.442 --> 05:12.513
WHAT'S TONIGHT?

05:12.513 --> 05:14.615
WE'RE GOING OUT;
BLOW OFF SOME STEAM.

05:14.615 --> 05:16.347
BIG GAME TOMORROW.

05:16.347 --> 05:18.819
I THOUGHT YOU
LIKED TO STAY IN

05:18.819 --> 05:20.020
THE NIGHT BEFORE A BIG GAME.

05:22.653 --> 05:24.795
ISN'T THAT WHY YOU DIDN'T GO
TO REGINA'S PARTY?

05:24.795 --> 05:28.659
THAT WAS AN "AWAY GAME."
THIS IS A HOME GAME.

05:28.659 --> 05:29.900
DIFFERENT RULES.

05:34.405 --> 05:35.636
Jo: ARE YOU NERVOUS?

05:35.636 --> 05:37.468
WHY?
IT'S JUST PRACTICE.

05:37.468 --> 05:39.370
WELL, IT'S YOUR
FIRST PRACTICE

05:39.370 --> 05:41.742
AND IT'S WITH LACEY'S
AGRO BOYFRIEND.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.815
HE'LL SETTLE DOWN ONCE
HE SEE'S HOW GOOD I AM.

05:44.815 --> 05:46.617
WOW, SOCCER MAKES
YOU COCKY.

05:46.617 --> 05:47.818
( laughs ) NO.

05:47.818 --> 05:49.420
IT'S CONFIDENCE.
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE.

05:49.420 --> 05:51.952
ARCHIE MAY HATE ME,
BUT HE WANTS TO WIN.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.884
WHO KNOWS WHAT
THAT GUY WANTS.

05:53.884 --> 05:54.985
HE'S A MYSTERY

05:54.985 --> 05:56.727
- AND A JACKASS.
- TRUE,

05:56.727 --> 05:58.389
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MAKE HIM A KILLER.

05:58.389 --> 06:00.461
HE LIED ABOUT
HIS ALIBI.

06:00.461 --> 06:01.532
IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.

06:01.532 --> 06:02.833
IT'S VERY WEIRD.

06:02.833 --> 06:04.835
BUT IF IT WAS REALLY SOMETHING,
DON'T YOU THINK

06:04.835 --> 06:05.866
YOUR DAD WOULD HAVE
FIGURED IT OUT?

06:05.866 --> 06:07.998
MY DAD'S A LITTLE

06:07.998 --> 06:09.840
LIKE ONE-TRACK MIND

06:09.840 --> 06:10.971
AT THE MOMENT.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.873
SO HOW DO FIGURE OUT
WHAT ARCHIE'S HIDING?

06:12.873 --> 06:13.844
YOU'RE ONE OF HIS
TEAM MATES NOW.

06:13.844 --> 06:14.875
CAN'T YOU JUST USE THAT?

06:14.875 --> 06:16.507
OH GOOD. GOOD.
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

06:16.507 --> 06:17.978
I'LL JUST BE LIKE,
"GLAD TO BE ON THE TEAM GUYS.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.010
BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW
IF OUR CAPTAIN

06:20.010 --> 06:21.412
HAD A REASON TO
COMMIT MURDER?"

06:21.412 --> 06:23.884
OKAY, OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE
TO BOND WITH THEM FIRST.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.686
YOU GOT TO MAKE THEM
LIKE YOU.

06:25.686 --> 06:26.757
I WAS PLANNING ON THAT.

06:26.757 --> 06:28.419
I HAD A LOT OF GUY FRIENDS.

06:28.419 --> 06:29.960
I DID GROW UP IN JUVIE.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.021
I MISS THOSE DELINQUENTS.

06:31.021 --> 06:32.793
RICO AND I AREN'T
ENOUGH FOR YOU?

06:32.793 --> 06:34.965
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU AND LACEY
HAD THAT GIRL THING.

06:36.627 --> 06:38.869
WHATEVER,
GIRLS ARE HORRIBLE,

06:38.869 --> 06:41.702
SNARKY MONSTERS.
GIVE ME GUY FRIENDS ANY DAY.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.182
KAREN.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.845
HELLO.

06:54.845 --> 06:56.046
HI, TESS.

06:58.188 --> 06:59.189
SO...

06:59.189 --> 07:00.921
YOU JUST...

07:00.921 --> 07:03.093
BUYING SOME MEAT?

07:03.093 --> 07:04.725
YOU'RE VERY OBSERVANT.

07:04.725 --> 07:08.058
KAREN, ABOUT THAT DINNER--

07:08.058 --> 07:10.000
OH, THERE'S NO NEED
TO REHASH IT.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.161
I THINK EVERYTHING'S
BEEN SAID.

07:11.161 --> 07:14.505
I WAS JUST GONNA SAY
THAT I REALLY LIKED IT.

07:14.505 --> 07:18.008
I WAS HOPING TO GET
THE RECIPE FOR THAT PASTA.

07:18.008 --> 07:20.511
BUY PASTA,
BOIL WATER,

07:20.511 --> 07:21.612
PUT TOMATO SAUCE ON IT.

07:27.017 --> 07:28.579
DANNY MADE IT.

07:28.579 --> 07:30.751
I'LL ASK HIM IF HE DID
ANYTHING SPECIAL TO IT.

07:30.751 --> 07:34.224
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

07:34.224 --> 07:35.886
THANKS.

07:35.886 --> 07:38.489
Woman: IS THAT KAREN OVER THERE?

07:38.489 --> 07:40.030
( whispering )

07:48.499 --> 07:49.840
NICE TO SEE YOU, TESS.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.604
Coach: ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP.

07:53.604 --> 07:55.005
WE GOT A NEW PLAYER.

07:55.005 --> 07:56.647
DANNY DESAI.

07:56.647 --> 07:58.709
HE'S GOT SKILLS.

07:58.709 --> 08:00.250
WE'RE GONNA
GIVE HIM A SHOT.

08:00.250 --> 08:01.852
I THINK HE CAN
REALLY HELP US.

08:01.852 --> 08:03.984
IF HE DOESN'T
KILL US FIRST.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.055
- ( snickers )
- Coach: OGDEN.

08:05.055 --> 08:06.917
- FIVE LAPS.
- COACH, I WAS JUST--

08:06.917 --> 08:08.488
FIVE LAPS, NOW!

08:09.820 --> 08:11.121
YOU THINK YOU GUYS
ARE NERVOUS,

08:11.121 --> 08:12.993
JUST IMAGINE HOW SCARED
THE OTHER TEAM WILL BE, RIGHT?

08:12.993 --> 08:13.994
SURE, WHATEVER, MAN.

08:15.866 --> 08:16.867
ENOUGH CHATTER.
LET'S GO, WARM UP!

08:20.200 --> 08:21.602
HEY, FREAK.

08:21.602 --> 08:24.605
YOU HEARD HIM.
LET'S WARM UP.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.777
WE'RE BACK TO FREAK, HUH?

08:26.777 --> 08:28.178
I KINDA MISSED IT.

08:37.187 --> 08:39.550
- OH.
- SORRY.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.595
JO, WAIT.

08:47.257 --> 08:49.259
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

08:49.259 --> 08:51.001
I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THAT VIDEO.

08:51.001 --> 08:53.163
I NEVER SAID YOU DID.

08:53.163 --> 08:54.905
YEAH, I KNOW.
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT.

08:54.905 --> 08:57.067
OKAY. THANKS.

08:58.869 --> 09:00.240
GOOD TALK, LACEY.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.573
Judy: JO, IS THAT YOU?

09:02.573 --> 09:04.214
JO.

09:04.214 --> 09:07.117
JO, IT'S BEEN SO LONG.
I'VE MISSED YOU.

09:07.117 --> 09:08.979
I'VE MISSED YOU TOO,
MRS. PORTER.

09:08.979 --> 09:10.881
OH NO, I WENT BACK TO
MY MAIDEN NAME A FEW YEARS AGO

09:10.881 --> 09:12.753
AFTER THE DIVORCE
WAS FINALIZED.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.124
I'M A SINGLE LADY NOW.

09:14.124 --> 09:16.056
WAITING FOR SOMEBODY ELSE
TO PUT A RING ON IT.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.227
MOM, REALLY?

09:18.759 --> 09:20.931
TRAVELLINI CUPCAKES,
IT MUST BE A SPECIAL OCCASION.

09:20.931 --> 09:22.933
OH, LACEY'S HAVING A COUPLE
OF GIRLS OVER TONIGHT.

09:22.933 --> 09:25.065
IT'S REALLY SMALL.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.767
SOUNDS LIKE A BLAST.

09:28.799 --> 09:30.140
YOU'RE WELCOME TO JOIN, JO.

09:33.103 --> 09:36.707
OH, I--

09:36.707 --> 09:37.808
I DON'T THINK THAT I CAN.

09:37.808 --> 09:39.009
HONEY, I AM SERIOUS.

09:39.009 --> 09:40.580
I MEAN, WE HAVE
ALL THESE CUPCAKES.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.854
MOM, JO SAID SHE
DIDN'T WANT TO COME.

09:43.854 --> 09:46.016
YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:46.016 --> 09:47.618
I'D LOVE TO COME.

09:47.618 --> 09:48.819
WHO CAN SAY NO

09:48.819 --> 09:50.090
TO A TRAVELLINI CUPCAKE, RIGHT?

09:50.090 --> 09:51.892
RIGHT.

09:53.764 --> 09:54.895
( chuckles )

10:02.172 --> 10:03.233
BLUE RANCH CHIPS?

10:03.233 --> 10:04.975
NO, I GOT SICK
OFF THOSE, ONCE.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.741
OOH.

10:10.741 --> 10:12.012
SPICY PORK RINDS.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.213
IT'S TOO MESSY.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.815
EVERYONE WILL BE LIKE
WASHING THEIR HANDS

10:14.815 --> 10:16.216
EVERY FIVE MINUTES.

10:17.387 --> 10:19.119
WHAT?

10:19.119 --> 10:21.391
NOTHING, YOU'RE JUST
SUCH A GIRL RIGHT NOW,

10:21.391 --> 10:23.924
PICKING OUT SPECIAL
GIRLY SNACKS

10:23.924 --> 10:26.196
TO GO BE GIRLY
WITH THE GALS.

10:26.196 --> 10:28.859
PLEASE DON'T SAY "GALS."

10:28.859 --> 10:32.032
PLUS, I'M NOT DOING THIS
FOR FUN.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.704
LACEY WAS REGINA'S BEST FRIEND

10:33.704 --> 10:36.006
AND HER BOYFRIEND
IS OUR PRIME SUSPECT.

10:36.006 --> 10:38.308
THE INTENSITY OF GIRL BONDING
MAKES PEOPLE REVEAL

10:38.308 --> 10:40.110
ALL SORTS OF THINGS.

10:40.110 --> 10:41.742
ALL RIGHT WELL,
IF YOU GET BORED,

10:41.742 --> 10:44.244
I'LL BE AT THE DINER EATING
REAL, NON-PACKAGED JUNK FOOD.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.076
YOU SHOULD INVITE
DANNY TO GO WITH YOU.

10:46.076 --> 10:48.218
TO THE DINER?

10:48.218 --> 10:50.180
ME AND DANNY TOGETHER,
JUST US?

10:50.180 --> 10:52.182
ARE YOU AFRAID
TO BE ALONE WITH HIM?

10:52.182 --> 10:53.754
NO, NO.
IT'S NOT THAT.

10:53.754 --> 10:56.056
IT'S JUST LIKE,
WHAT WOULD WE TALK ABOUT?

10:56.056 --> 10:57.087
I DON'T KNOW.

10:57.087 --> 10:59.259
GUY STUFF?

10:59.259 --> 11:03.193
CARS, SPORTS,
HOT CHICKS?

11:03.193 --> 11:04.895
PLEASE DON'T SAY "CHICKS."

11:04.895 --> 11:07.938
OOH.

11:07.938 --> 11:10.941
HIGH-FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP
SHAPED LIKE CORN,

11:10.941 --> 11:12.672
WE HAVE A WINNER.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.204
LET'S GO.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.376
Lacey: SARITA, COME ON.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.678
IF HAVING JO THERE
IS A DISASTER, YOU CAN GO.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.310
I'LL EVEN LET YOU
PICK THE MOVIES.

11:20.310 --> 11:22.212
GREAT.

11:22.212 --> 11:24.284
IT'LL BE FUN.
I PROMISE.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.756
OKAY, BYE.

11:25.756 --> 11:27.718
Judy: ( knocking ) HONEY.

11:27.718 --> 11:29.219
- MOM, I'M BUSY.
- I KNOW,

11:29.219 --> 11:31.121
BUT MRS. CRANE IS HERE.

11:33.423 --> 11:35.225
MRS. CRANE.

11:35.225 --> 11:37.097
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

11:37.097 --> 11:38.328
ALL RIGHT, LACEY.

11:38.328 --> 11:39.970
HOW ARE YOU?

11:39.970 --> 11:41.231
FINE.

11:41.231 --> 11:43.834
I JUST WANTED
TO STOP BY

11:43.834 --> 11:46.276
AND GIVE YOU SOME
OF REGINA'S THINGS:

11:46.276 --> 11:49.980
SCHOOL STUFF MOSTLY,
SOME PICTURES,

11:49.980 --> 11:52.212
AND THINGS FROM HER LOCKER,

11:52.212 --> 11:54.114
ANYTHING THE POLICE
DIDN'T TAKE AWAY FROM ME

11:54.114 --> 11:57.117
WHILE THEY'VE BEEN BUSY
NOT ARRESTING THE DESAI BOY.

11:59.249 --> 12:02.292
THANKS.
THIS--

12:02.292 --> 12:04.324
IT MEANS A LOT.

12:07.758 --> 12:09.229
OH, AND THANK YOU AGAIN

12:09.229 --> 12:12.032
FOR TAKING OVER
THE GREENER GROVE
BRUNCH TOMORROW.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.464
I'M JUST NOT READY.

12:14.464 --> 12:16.736
WE ALL MISS YOU SO MUCH.

12:21.171 --> 12:24.074
OH, EVERYTHING OKAY
WITH SARITA?

12:24.074 --> 12:26.446
YEAH, AFTER A LOT
OF BRIBING, MOM.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.119
OKAY, SWEETIE, I'M SORRY,
BUT COME ON.

12:29.119 --> 12:31.822
YOU AND JO USED
TO BE SO CLOSE.

12:31.822 --> 12:33.854
MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO BURY THE HATCHET.

12:41.231 --> 12:42.833
( whistle )

12:42.833 --> 12:44.364
THAT SUCKED...

12:44.364 --> 12:45.936
A LOT.

12:45.936 --> 12:46.937
ALL RIGHT, NEXT GROUP.

12:46.937 --> 12:48.768
YATES, OGDEN ON DEFENSE.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.941
DESAI, FARRELL ON OFFENSE.
LET'S GO.

12:50.941 --> 12:53.273
HEY, YATES, YOU EXPLAIN
THE DRILL TO DESAI?

12:53.273 --> 12:55.045
YEAH, SURE DID, COACH.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.908
LET'S GO!

12:57.908 --> 12:59.779
OKAY, ARE YOU
A LEFT OR A RIGHT?

12:59.779 --> 13:00.881
WHICHEVER ONE YOU WANT, MAN.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.288
( whistle blows )

13:14.524 --> 13:16.226
DANNY!

13:22.232 --> 13:24.104
YEAH, MAN.
THAT WAS AWESOME.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.175
- THANK YOU, MAN.
- GOOD JOB. GOOD JOB.

13:25.175 --> 13:26.206
COOL.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.983
NICE WORK, DESAI.

13:32.983 --> 13:34.484
BE PREPARED TO START
RIGHT FORWARD TOMORROW.

13:34.484 --> 13:36.246
WHOA, COACH.

13:36.246 --> 13:37.217
YOU'RE GONNA REPLACE BRANDON

13:37.217 --> 13:38.588
WITH A GUY WHO'S
BEEN HERE A DAY?

13:38.588 --> 13:39.819
WHO'S LINE UP IS IT,
YATES?

13:39.819 --> 13:40.991
IT'S YOUR LINE UP, COACH.

13:40.991 --> 13:42.422
GOOD.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.593
GLAD WE GOT
THAT SETTLED.

13:51.001 --> 13:52.162
NOPE.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.335
VERY NOPE.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.107
STOP IT.

13:57.107 --> 13:58.438
YOUR CLOTHES ARE GREAT.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.610
- THEY'RE YOU.
- YEAH, THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

14:00.610 --> 14:04.244
I'M ME AND LACEY
DOES NOT WANT ME THERE.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.216
WHATEVER.

14:06.216 --> 14:08.018
I GUESS IF IT GETS REALLY BAD,
I CAN JUST

14:08.018 --> 14:10.080
GO DOWNSTAIRS AND
HANG OUT WITH JUDY.

14:10.080 --> 14:14.084
I THINK IT'S SWEET
THAT JUDY INVITED YOU.

14:14.084 --> 14:16.126
SOMETIMES WE ALL NEED

14:16.126 --> 14:17.357
A LITTLE BIT OF
A HELPING HAND.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.290
THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE LYRICS
TO A CHILDREN'S SONG.

14:21.231 --> 14:24.034
THIS HAS A CAT ON IT...

14:24.034 --> 14:26.066
OR AT LEAST
I THINK IT'S A CAT.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.038
THAT'S GIRLY, RIGHT?

14:28.038 --> 14:30.240
STOP. RELAX.

14:30.240 --> 14:31.571
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
SO MUCH FUN TONIGHT.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.273
I PROMISE.

14:35.545 --> 14:37.607
Judy: HEY, GIRLS.

14:37.607 --> 14:39.149
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

14:39.149 --> 14:41.351
Phoebe: JO, HI.

14:41.351 --> 14:44.184
I LIKE YOUR SHIRT.

14:46.016 --> 14:47.317
IS THAT A DEMON?

14:47.317 --> 14:48.588
IT LOOKS LIKE A FETUS.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.635
SO THEN I TOLD THE WAITER

15:05.635 --> 15:08.138
"I'M SORRY, DO I LOOK
LIKE A GIRL WHO DRINKS

15:08.138 --> 15:10.580
PINK LEMONADE?"

15:10.580 --> 15:12.512
I'M BORED.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.284
LACEY WILL BE BACK
IN A MINUTE WITH FOOD.

15:14.284 --> 15:16.586
I THINK WE CAN TOLERATE
EACH OTHER UNTIL THEN.

15:16.586 --> 15:17.988
CAN WE, PHOEBE?

15:20.320 --> 15:22.492
I GUESS WE MIGHT AS WELL
PICK A MOVIE FOR LATER.

15:22.492 --> 15:24.154
OKAY, WHAT'D YOU BRING?

15:24.154 --> 15:26.156
"WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN,"
"THE BAD SEED,"

15:26.156 --> 15:28.498
"THE GOOD SON,"
AND "THE OMEN."

15:28.498 --> 15:30.430
YOUR CHOICE, JO,

15:30.430 --> 15:31.501
SINCE IT'S YOUR
FAVORITE GENRE.

15:32.532 --> 15:35.335
I'LL WATCH ANYTHING...

15:35.335 --> 15:37.237
AS LONG AS
I'M NOT STARRING IT.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.669
I DIDN'T BRING
ANY STALKER MOVIES.

15:39.669 --> 15:41.441
I WAS INVITED, ACTUALLY.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.513
YEAH, BY LACEY'S MOM.

15:43.513 --> 15:44.674
Lacey: ALL RIGHT.

15:44.674 --> 15:48.218
FOOD'S HERE.
EVERYONE HAVING FUN?

15:54.124 --> 15:55.455
HEY, UH,

15:55.455 --> 15:58.989
SO SHOULD I PITCH IN
FOR PIZZA?

15:58.989 --> 16:00.130
IT'S OKAY, MY MOM'S TREAT.

16:01.731 --> 16:04.464
SO YOUR MOM
SEEMS REALLY HAPPY.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.965
YEAH, I GUESS.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.697
I JUST REMEMBER

16:07.697 --> 16:10.040
HOW SAD SHE WAS
RIGHT AFTER THE DIVORCE.

16:10.040 --> 16:13.473
UM, BUT SHE'S GREAT NOW
SO...

16:13.473 --> 16:14.744
YEAH, I DON'T
REALLY TALK TO HER

16:14.744 --> 16:16.046
ABOUT THAT KIND OF STUFF.

16:16.046 --> 16:17.447
RIGHT, YEAH,
I'M SURE.

16:17.447 --> 16:18.578
SHE LOOKS REALLY GOOD.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.510
FOR HER AGE.
I JUST THINK THAT

16:20.510 --> 16:22.452
GUYS WOULD HAVE
A LOT OF FUN WITH HER...

16:22.452 --> 16:24.314
AT RESTAURANTS

16:24.314 --> 16:26.386
OR BOWLING.

16:33.463 --> 16:35.395
DID YOU JUST CALL
LACEY'S MOM A SLUT?

16:37.067 --> 16:39.029
( doorbell rings )

16:44.574 --> 16:46.676
TESS, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

16:46.676 --> 16:48.438
I WAS JUST
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

16:48.438 --> 16:50.610
AND THOUGHT I'D STOP BY
AND SAY "HI."

16:50.610 --> 16:53.113
OH, OKAY.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.515
HI.

16:59.189 --> 17:01.551
I ALSO WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW

17:01.551 --> 17:03.593
THAT THE GREENER GROVE
CHARITY BRUNCH IS TOMORROW.

17:05.555 --> 17:08.158
I HAVEN'T BEEN
TO ONE OF THESE IN YEARS.

17:08.158 --> 17:11.761
DO YOU WANT TO
COME WITH ME?

17:11.761 --> 17:14.504
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

17:14.504 --> 17:16.666
BUT IT'LL BE OKAY.

17:16.666 --> 17:19.038
PEOPLE WANT TO SEE YOU.

17:19.038 --> 17:22.572
THEY KNOW YOU'VE BEEN
HAVING A HARD TIME LATELY.

17:22.572 --> 17:26.446
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

17:26.446 --> 17:28.678
- OKAY?
- OKAY.

17:31.221 --> 17:32.452
THANK YOU.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.624
- I WILL.
- OKAY.

17:40.690 --> 17:41.791
Rico: THESE ONION RINGS

17:41.791 --> 17:43.263
- ARE GOOD, HUH?
- YEAH, THEY ARE.

17:43.263 --> 17:44.364
YOU WANT ME
TO GET SOME MORE?

17:44.364 --> 17:45.465
YEAH, IF YOU WANT TO,
THAT'S COOL, MAN.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.097
I'M COOL WITH THAT PLAN.

17:47.097 --> 17:49.068
CASUAL EVENING HANG OUT--

17:49.068 --> 17:51.501
A COUPLE GUYS CHATTING--
BROS.

17:51.501 --> 17:52.502
YOU ALL RIGHT, RICO?

17:52.502 --> 17:53.673
YEAH, I'M SORRY.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.074
WHENEVER THERE'S A PAUSE
IN THE CONVERSATION,

17:55.074 --> 17:56.606
I FEEL LIKE I'M
GONNA THROW UP.

17:56.606 --> 17:58.548
DUDE, JUST RELAX, MAN.
LET IT BE.

17:58.548 --> 18:00.110
I'M A BIG FAN
OF THE AWKWARD SILENCE.

18:00.110 --> 18:01.611
JUST RELAX;
FOCUS THE MIND.

18:01.611 --> 18:03.113
SHH, JUST...

18:08.258 --> 18:09.459
YEAH, OKAY.
THAT WAS FUN.

18:09.459 --> 18:10.720
- RIGHT?
- YEAH, YEAH.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.592
- YOU'RE RIGHT. I NEEDED THAT.
- IT'S GOOD.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.125
HEY, HOW'D YOUR FIRST
PRACTICE GO TODAY?

18:15.125 --> 18:17.467
IT WAS PRETTY GOOD.

18:17.467 --> 18:19.129
I THINK I'M STARTING
IN THE GAME TOMORROW.

18:19.129 --> 18:21.571
OH, THAT SOUNDS PROMISING.

18:21.571 --> 18:23.503
YEAH, SOME OF THE GUYS
ARE STARTING TO WARM UP
TO ME.

18:23.503 --> 18:24.834
I ACTUALLY GOT
MY FIRST FIST BUMP.

18:24.834 --> 18:26.476
DUDE, CONGRATULATIONS.

18:26.476 --> 18:28.308
DANNY, I'VE NEVER GOTTEN
A FIST BUMP IN MY ENTIRE LIFE

18:28.308 --> 18:30.610
EXCEPT FOR LIKE
MY UNCLE CLYDE,

18:30.610 --> 18:31.881
BUT THAT DOESN'T REALLY COUNT
BECAUSE HE'S BLIND

18:31.881 --> 18:33.713
SO USUALLY THAT'S BY MISTAKE.

18:33.713 --> 18:36.486
- DO YOU WANT TO-- GIVE IT--
- ( laughs )

18:36.486 --> 18:38.248
COME ON, PUT IT RIGHT THERE.
PARK IT.

18:38.248 --> 18:40.250
- ( laughing )
- YOU GOT IT.

18:40.250 --> 18:42.392
ALL RIGHT,
YEAH, RIGHT.

18:42.392 --> 18:44.554
- OKAY, DOING IT AGAIN.
- WHAT'S UP, DOG?

18:44.554 --> 18:46.296
ALL RIGHT.

18:46.296 --> 18:48.258
HEY, WHAT'S UP, DOG?

18:48.258 --> 18:50.260
NO, THAT'S ENOUGH.

18:50.260 --> 18:52.162
I-- YEAH, I'M SORRY.
I WAS GONNA--

18:52.162 --> 18:53.503
- NO.
- I MEAN, I--

18:53.503 --> 18:55.765
( door opens )

18:55.765 --> 18:57.637
( laughing, clattering )

19:01.611 --> 19:03.713
OKAY, WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY HAD THE SAME IDEA AS US.

19:08.378 --> 19:10.250
WHAT'S A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND?

19:10.250 --> 19:12.622
- SEE IT?
- GOT IT.

19:18.288 --> 19:20.230
OKAY--
( clears throat )

19:20.230 --> 19:22.532
CENTAURS...

19:22.532 --> 19:26.366
SPECIAL MUSICAL GUEST CHER,

19:26.366 --> 19:28.398
RYAN GOSLING RIDING IN
ON A WHITE HORSE.

19:30.540 --> 19:31.771
OBVIOUSLY I'M PICKING
GOSLING ON A HORSE.

19:31.771 --> 19:32.772
WHO'S WAS THAT?

19:32.772 --> 19:34.474
IT'S MINE.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.206
GOOD CALL.

19:36.206 --> 19:37.347
ANOTHER POINT FOR JO.

19:41.511 --> 19:44.484
HEY, LACEY,
WHAT IS THIS?

19:44.484 --> 19:45.855
REGINA'S MOM
GAVE IT TO ME.

19:45.855 --> 19:48.358
JUST SOME OF REGINA'S
PERSONAL STUFF,

19:48.358 --> 19:49.619
MOSTLY FROM SCHOOL.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.793
I HAVEN'T REALLY
BEEN ABLE TO

19:53.793 --> 19:55.525
GET MYSELF TO
GO THROUGH IT YET.

19:55.525 --> 19:57.797
I WONDER IF HER OLD
SPANISH TEXT BOOK IS IN THERE.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.230
REMEMBER THE ONE SHE USED
TO PRETEND TO HAVE LOST

20:00.230 --> 20:02.602
EVERY TIME MRS. MERTES
ASKED HER TO READ ALOUD.

20:02.602 --> 20:03.803
( laughs )

20:05.605 --> 20:07.737
HOW ABOUT A MOVIE?

20:07.737 --> 20:10.380
GOOD IDEA.
WHAT ARE WE WATCHING?

20:10.380 --> 20:13.413
OKAY, I DIDN'T WANT TO
SAY ANYTHING BEFORE, BUT...

20:14.544 --> 20:16.686
I BROUGHT A REALLY
AWESOME SURPRISE.

20:16.686 --> 20:20.390
GREASE, THE SING-ALONG VERSION.

20:20.390 --> 20:21.521
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.

20:21.521 --> 20:22.552
Lacey: THE SING-ALONG VERSION?

20:22.552 --> 20:24.254
Phoebe: IT'S A GROUP ACTIVITY.

20:24.254 --> 20:25.655
Lacey: AND WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO ACTUALLY SING ALONG?

20:31.301 --> 20:33.363
IT REALLY DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
THEY'RE HAVING THAT MUCH FUN.

20:33.363 --> 20:35.405
( boisterous laughter )

20:35.405 --> 20:38.938
NO, NOT AT ALL.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.010
COME ON.
IT WAS YOUR FIRST PRACTICE.

20:41.010 --> 20:43.613
PLUS, ARCHIE HATES YOU
AND HE'S THE CAPTAIN.

20:43.613 --> 20:46.776
RICO, I APPRECIATE THAT,

20:46.776 --> 20:47.817
BUT I'M FINE.

20:47.817 --> 20:49.649
AND IT'S BEEN FUN,
YOU KNOW?

20:49.649 --> 20:51.281
JUST US HANGING OUT.

20:54.324 --> 20:56.926
YOU WANT TO
SNEAK OUT THE BACK?

21:03.993 --> 21:05.335
HEY, GUYS.

21:08.798 --> 21:11.270
- YOU FOLLOWING US, PSYCHO?
- NO, NO.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.702
I'M JUST HANGING OUT
WITH MY BUDDY RICO.

21:12.702 --> 21:15.044
RICO, THE TEAM.
THE TEAM, RICO.

21:15.044 --> 21:16.676
( voice breaks )
SOCCER.

21:19.048 --> 21:20.750
DESAI,
YOU WANT TO JOIN US?

21:24.314 --> 21:25.985
NO.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.357
NO, MAN, THAT'S OKAY.

21:29.489 --> 21:32.362
TRY THE ONION RINGS.
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD.

21:38.728 --> 21:42.301
( phone rings )

21:42.301 --> 21:43.973
DID WE GET
THE SEARCH WARRANT?

21:43.973 --> 21:45.304
GREAT, SANDY.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.436
ALL RIGHT, LET'S MEET
TOMORROW MORNING.

21:46.436 --> 21:47.837
WE'LL FIGURE OUT
A PLAN FROM THERE.

21:47.837 --> 21:50.780
GOT TO GO.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

21:50.780 --> 21:52.342
I GOT A TEXT FROM JO.

21:52.342 --> 21:54.714
SHE SAID ALL THE GIRLS DECIDED
TO JUST SPEND THE NIGHT.

21:54.714 --> 21:56.986
- JUST LIKE OLD TIMES, HUH?
- YEAH.

21:56.986 --> 21:59.449
CAN YOU PICK HER UP
TOMORROW MORNING?

21:59.449 --> 22:01.351
I HAVE TO GET READY
FOR THIS CHARITY BRUNCH.

22:02.452 --> 22:03.623
THING SOUNDS EXHAUSTING.

22:03.623 --> 22:05.024
IT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE.

22:06.996 --> 22:08.898
I INVITED KAREN, BY THE WAY.

22:08.898 --> 22:11.601
WOW.
DID SHE ACCEPT?

22:11.601 --> 22:13.102
SHE'S THINKING ABOUT IT.

22:13.102 --> 22:15.104
WHAT TIME IS THAT THING OVER?

22:15.104 --> 22:17.336
AROUND 2:00, WHY?

22:17.336 --> 22:19.008
NO REASON,
JUST WONDERING.

22:19.008 --> 22:21.070
I FEEL SO BAD
FOR KAREN.

22:21.070 --> 22:22.812
I RAN INTO HER TODAY.

22:22.812 --> 22:24.644
SHE WAS JUST--

22:24.644 --> 22:26.676
SHE'S A PARIAH,
YOU KNOW?

22:44.033 --> 22:45.535
Lacey: JUST BRING THE WHOLE
BOWL BACK.

22:45.535 --> 22:47.737
YOU WERE GETTING
CANDY CORN, RIGHT?

22:47.737 --> 22:49.569
YEAH.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.143
HERE.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.977
THIS WAS
A REALLY GOOD IDEA.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.148
THANKS.

22:59.148 --> 23:00.149
( snoring )

23:03.012 --> 23:05.114
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE
BOTH ASLEEP ALREADY.

23:05.114 --> 23:08.057
ALL THAT
BACK AND FORTH SNARKING

23:08.057 --> 23:09.619
WAS CLEARLY EXHAUSTING.

23:09.619 --> 23:11.060
I GUESS I WAS NAIVE
TO THINK

23:11.060 --> 23:13.423
THAT ONE GIRL'S NIGHT
COULD MAKE THEM FRIENDS.

23:13.423 --> 23:15.124
( Phoebe snores )

23:15.124 --> 23:16.526
MY GOD, IS SHE A BEAR?

23:19.699 --> 23:20.700
THANK YOU.

23:22.902 --> 23:25.004
I'M SORT OF
GLAD YOU CAME.

23:25.004 --> 23:27.437
SORT OF?

23:27.437 --> 23:30.640
WOW, DON'T GET TOO
CARRIED AWAY THERE, LACE.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.141
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

23:41.491 --> 23:45.525
REMEMBER THAT TIME

23:45.525 --> 23:47.797
DANNY TRIED TO CRASH
ONE OF OUR SLEEPOVERS?

23:47.797 --> 23:51.200
YEAH, HE ALWAYS WHINED
ABOUT NOT BEING INVITED.

23:51.200 --> 23:53.903
HE WAS SUCH A BABY.

23:53.903 --> 23:55.865
WHAT'S IT LIKE?

23:55.865 --> 23:58.708
BEING AROUND DANNY
ALL THE TIME AGAIN?

23:58.708 --> 24:01.110
IT'S NOT THAT DIFFERENT.

24:04.644 --> 24:07.817
IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFERENT.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.852
HE TALKS ABOUT YOU
ALL THE TIME.

24:14.183 --> 24:15.985
HE REALLY MISSES YOU.

24:15.985 --> 24:17.927
( snoring )

24:17.927 --> 24:19.128
- ( snores )
- GIVE ME THE BOWL.

24:19.128 --> 24:21.561
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

26:27.917 --> 26:29.588
Coach: JUST A FEW MORE.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.320
KEEP GOING.
ALL THE WAY UP.

26:37.326 --> 26:39.128
YOU WANT SOMETHING?

26:39.128 --> 26:42.171
YEAH.
I WANT TO WIN.

26:42.171 --> 26:44.934
SO HOW ABOUT FOR
THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS,

26:44.934 --> 26:46.275
WE HATE THE OTHER TEAM

26:46.275 --> 26:47.276
MORE THAN
WE HATE EACH OTHER.

26:47.276 --> 26:49.278
I PROMISE
YOU CAN GO RIGHT BACK

26:49.278 --> 26:50.710
TO HATING MY GUTS
AFTERWARDS.

26:55.044 --> 26:58.147
THEY RELY TO MUCH
ON FORWARDS AND DEFENDERS.

26:58.147 --> 27:00.289
AND THEIR MIDFIELD
IS WEAK.

27:00.289 --> 27:02.091
GOOD TO KNOW.

27:12.201 --> 27:14.904
( chatter )

27:19.108 --> 27:21.040
JUDY.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.642
GLORIA.

27:23.642 --> 27:24.744
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WEREN'T COMING.

27:24.744 --> 27:26.716
OH, I KNOW,
BUT THE HOUSE,

27:26.716 --> 27:27.877
IT JUST FELT SO EMPTY.

27:27.877 --> 27:29.648
I HOPE THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.220
IT'S WONDERFUL.

27:31.220 --> 27:32.351
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A SECOND?

27:32.351 --> 27:33.352
I HAVE TO MAKE A CALL.

27:33.352 --> 27:34.984
- SURE.
- ( door opens )

27:37.056 --> 27:40.429
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I LET YOU TALK ME INTO THIS.

27:40.429 --> 27:42.391
COME ON.

27:42.391 --> 27:44.233
I'LL BUY YOU A FREE MIMOSA

27:44.233 --> 27:46.696
AT THE OPEN BAR.

27:46.696 --> 27:47.837
WHAT IS SHE DOING--

27:51.741 --> 27:53.342
KAREN.

27:59.448 --> 28:00.449
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

28:02.752 --> 28:03.953
I'M SO PLEASED
YOU COULD COME.

28:03.953 --> 28:06.115
OH, THANK YOU, GLORIA.

28:12.962 --> 28:14.764
I THINK I'LL TAKE
THAT FREE MIMOSA NOW.

28:14.764 --> 28:16.225
YEAH.

28:20.800 --> 28:21.801
GO, GO, GO!

28:21.801 --> 28:22.832
HEY.

28:25.004 --> 28:26.776
( cheering )

28:27.907 --> 28:29.839
HEY.

28:38.988 --> 28:40.719
- Coach: NICE JOB!
- ( cheering )

28:40.719 --> 28:41.751
NICE JOB, DESAI.

28:41.751 --> 28:43.722
FARRELL, NICE JOB.

28:44.994 --> 28:46.095
YEAH, DANNY!

28:46.095 --> 28:48.027
- YEAH!
- DUDE, THAT WAS AWESOME.

28:48.027 --> 28:51.160
HEY, RISKY PASS.

28:51.160 --> 28:52.962
NICE FINISH, DESAI.

29:01.470 --> 29:02.812
Announcer: It's halftime
and our Grizzlies

29:02.812 --> 29:05.274
are up by one.

29:05.274 --> 29:08.818
SO YOU THINK THAT
ARCHIE AND REGINA

29:08.818 --> 29:10.820
- HAD A THING?
- I DON'T KNOW.

29:10.820 --> 29:12.321
YOU SHOULD GIVE
THIS DVD TO YOUR DAD.

29:12.321 --> 29:13.382
THIS COULD LEAD
TO A MOTIVE OR SOMETHING.

29:13.382 --> 29:14.523
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.

29:14.523 --> 29:16.786
HE WON'T LISTEN.

29:16.786 --> 29:18.157
HAVE YOU GOTTEN
ANYTHING ON ARCHIE?

29:18.157 --> 29:19.258
NOT YET.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.991
BUT I'VE ONLY BEEN
ON THE TEAM A DAY.

29:21.991 --> 29:23.762
SCORING THAT GOAL
PROBABLY HELPED.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.434
THEN SCORE MORE GOALS.

29:27.536 --> 29:29.768
IT ACTUALLY DIDN'T SUCK

29:29.768 --> 29:32.201
HAVING JO THERE LAST NIGHT,
YOU KNOW?

29:32.201 --> 29:33.472
COME ON, ADMIT IT.

29:33.472 --> 29:35.104
YOU HATE JO
A LITTLE LESS NOW.

29:35.104 --> 29:38.948
I WAS GONNA TELL YOU
THIS MORNING,

29:38.948 --> 29:42.181
BUT YOU LOOKED
SO GROSSLY HAPPY.

29:42.181 --> 29:43.452
TELL ME WHAT?

29:46.285 --> 29:48.317
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
JO AND LACEY THIS MORNING.

29:48.317 --> 29:49.919
IT WAS LIKE
NOTHING HAD CHANGED.

29:49.919 --> 29:51.520
JUDY.

29:51.520 --> 29:52.791
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW HAPPY
IT MAKES ME TO HEAR THAT.

29:54.493 --> 29:56.996
WOULD YOU LADIES EXCUSE ME?

29:56.996 --> 29:58.197
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

30:02.531 --> 30:05.504
GLORIA.

30:05.504 --> 30:07.106
HI.

30:07.106 --> 30:08.507
KAREN.

30:08.507 --> 30:11.040
I JUST WANTED TO SAY

30:11.040 --> 30:13.042
THAT I'M REALLY SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

30:13.042 --> 30:15.144
I DIDN'T KNOW REGINA,
BUT I HEARD

30:15.144 --> 30:16.285
SHE WAS A REALLY
LOVELY GIRL.

30:16.285 --> 30:18.547
SHE WAS LOVELY.

30:18.547 --> 30:20.249
AND SHE'D STILL BE HERE

30:20.249 --> 30:22.551
IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOUR
DERANGED MONSTER OF A SON.

30:22.551 --> 30:26.225
GLORIA, I--

30:26.225 --> 30:27.356
DANNY--

30:27.356 --> 30:29.298
DIDN'T DO IT?

30:29.298 --> 30:31.560
WE BOTH KNOW
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.903
I'VE ALREADY TALKED
TO THE SCHOOL BOARD

30:33.903 --> 30:36.065
ABOUT HAVING HIM KICKED OUT
OF GREEN GROVE HIGH.

30:36.065 --> 30:38.467
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL FIND A WAY.

30:40.369 --> 30:42.071
Judy: OH, AND JO'S HAIR,

30:42.071 --> 30:45.014
IT LOOKS SO CUTE
ALL FRIZZY LIKE THAT.

30:45.014 --> 30:48.117
YOU KNOW SHE'S REALLY GROWN
INTO SUCH A BEAUTIFUL GIRL.

30:48.117 --> 30:50.179
AND THEN I'LL MAKE IT
MY PERSONAL MISSION

30:50.179 --> 30:52.121
TO ENSURE THAT HE SPENDS
THE REST OF HIS NATURAL LIFE

30:52.121 --> 30:54.623
EXACTLY WHERE HE BELONGS--
IN PRISON.

30:54.623 --> 30:57.426
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU,
KAREN.

31:05.094 --> 31:07.036
Judy: WE SHOULD GET
TICKETS TO SOMETHING,

31:07.036 --> 31:09.969
HAVE LIKE A MOMS'
AND DAUGHTERS' OUTING.

31:12.401 --> 31:13.402
JUDY, WILL YOU EXCUSE ME?

31:14.904 --> 31:17.076
KAREN, KAREN.

31:17.076 --> 31:18.447
WAIT.
WHAT HAPPENED?

31:18.447 --> 31:19.608
I NEVER SHOULD
HAVE COME HERE.

31:19.608 --> 31:21.310
KAREN.

31:47.506 --> 31:48.637
YATES,

31:48.637 --> 31:49.608
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

31:49.608 --> 31:51.540
HE HAD A MAN ON

31:51.540 --> 31:52.581
AND HE DIDN'T HAVE CONTROL
OF THE BALL.

31:57.446 --> 31:58.647
Rico: COME ON!

31:58.647 --> 32:00.619
COME ON,
MAKE MORE POINTS!

32:00.619 --> 32:04.353
WHAT ARE THEY--
COME ON, HEY!

32:04.353 --> 32:06.325
WHOA.

32:06.325 --> 32:09.098
Announcer:
And the Huskies score.

32:09.098 --> 32:11.260
I MAY BE WRONG,
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE
WE'RE LOSING MOMENTUM.

32:11.260 --> 32:12.401
( sighs )

32:12.401 --> 32:14.103
WHAT DID YOU TAKE
FROM THAT BOX?

32:14.103 --> 32:16.465
I DON'T KNOW WHAT--

32:16.465 --> 32:18.037
DON'T LIE TO ME!
SARITA SAW YOU.

32:21.240 --> 32:23.442
UH, OKAY.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.249
I FOUND THIS DVD
THAT REGINA MADE

32:30.249 --> 32:32.081
OF ARCHIE.

32:32.081 --> 32:33.522
I'M SORRY THAT
I TOOK IT FROM YOU.

32:33.522 --> 32:34.623
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

32:34.623 --> 32:35.684
WHAT IT MEANT BEFORE I--

32:37.356 --> 32:39.488
I DIDN'T WANT
YOU TO GET HURT.

32:39.488 --> 32:41.630
WHAT WAS ON THE DVD?

32:41.630 --> 32:43.732
TELL ME NOW!

32:43.732 --> 32:45.034
( sighs )

32:45.034 --> 32:46.495
OKAY, UM,

32:46.495 --> 32:49.038
IT'S ARCHIE
PLAYING SOCCER.

32:49.038 --> 32:51.340
BUT IT JUST MADE IT
SEEM LIKE...

32:51.340 --> 32:53.672
LIKE MAYBE THAT THEY WERE
MORE THAN JUST FRIENDS.

32:53.672 --> 32:55.644
WHAT?

32:55.644 --> 32:57.176
- THAT'S--
- IT'S CRAZY I KNOW.

32:57.176 --> 32:58.647
OKAY, IT JUMPED OUT AT ME

32:58.647 --> 33:04.213
BECAUSE ARCHIE'S ALIBI
FROM THE NIGHT OF THE PARTY,

33:04.213 --> 33:05.714
IT'S NOT TRUE.

33:05.714 --> 33:07.216
HE WAS AT HOME SLEEPING.

33:07.216 --> 33:09.288
NO, HE WAS BORROWING
SCOTT'S CAR.

33:09.288 --> 33:11.660
OKAY, LET ME GET
THIS STRAIGHT.

33:11.660 --> 33:13.162
YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT MY BOYFRIEND

33:13.162 --> 33:15.194
WAS SLEEPING WITH
MY BEST FRIEND

33:15.194 --> 33:16.495
AND THAT LEAD TO HIM
MURDERING HER.

33:16.495 --> 33:19.468
NO, LACEY, I DON'T KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

33:19.468 --> 33:20.599
- I'M JUST--
- SAVE IT!

33:26.635 --> 33:29.438
Announcer: We're down
to the last 30 seconds
of the game.

33:29.438 --> 33:31.180
It's crunch time
for the Grizzlies.

33:34.513 --> 33:35.614
HEY, HEY, HEY!

33:35.614 --> 33:36.785
HEY!

33:36.785 --> 33:39.088
ARCH, MAN ON.
GET IT TO DESAI.

33:39.088 --> 33:40.289
HEY, HEY!

33:40.289 --> 33:41.490
HE'S OPEN. HIT HIM.
HIT HIM. HIT HIM.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.026
( whistle blows )

33:53.732 --> 33:55.334
NICE FINISH, CAPTAIN.

34:06.545 --> 34:07.676
I KNOW WE'RE
ALL DISAPPOINTED,

34:07.676 --> 34:09.318
BUT THEY HAD A STRONG DAY.

34:09.318 --> 34:11.080
AND WE HAD AN OFF DAY.

34:11.080 --> 34:12.551
WE'LL GET THEM NEXT TIME,
RIGHT?

34:12.551 --> 34:14.323
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN
THEM THIS TIME

34:14.323 --> 34:15.524
IF YOU WEREN'T
SUCH A BALL HOG.

34:15.524 --> 34:17.526
WHAT'D YOU SAY, FARRELL?

34:17.526 --> 34:20.289
HE CALLED YOU A BALL HOG.

34:21.460 --> 34:24.233
I WAS WIDE OPEN AT
THE END OF THAT GAME.

34:24.233 --> 34:25.664
YOU WERE BLOCKED.

34:27.236 --> 34:29.298
OH, AND NOBODY ELSE
SAW THAT?

34:32.301 --> 34:34.303
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
ON YOUR OWN THERE, CAPTAIN.

34:34.303 --> 34:35.674
THESE GUYS MAY HAVE
FORGOTTEN WHO YOU ARE,

34:35.674 --> 34:38.547
- BUT I HAVEN'T.
- I PAID FOR WHAT I DID.

34:38.547 --> 34:39.778
NOT FOR KILLING REGINA.

34:39.778 --> 34:43.412
I DIDN'T KILL REGINA
AND YOU KNOW THAT.

34:43.412 --> 34:44.813
AND HOW WOULD I KNOW THAT?

34:44.813 --> 34:48.117
BECAUSE YOUR ALIBI FOR
THE NIGHT OF THE PARTY,

34:48.117 --> 34:50.859
IT SUCKS.

34:51.860 --> 34:54.423
I WAS HOME.

34:54.423 --> 34:57.266
IS THAT RIGHT, SCOTT?

34:58.497 --> 35:01.430
YEAH, HE WAS HOME.

35:01.430 --> 35:04.173
THEN WHY'D YOU
LEND HIM YOUR CAR?

35:04.173 --> 35:06.275
I-- I-- I DIDN'T.

35:06.275 --> 35:08.537
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

35:08.537 --> 35:10.639
GEE, I HOPE YOU ARE

35:10.639 --> 35:12.481
BECAUSE IF NOT,

35:12.481 --> 35:14.183
YOU'RE GONNA BE
AN ACCESSORY TO MURDER.

35:16.114 --> 35:19.418
JUST TELL 'EM, ARCHIE.
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWAY.

35:19.418 --> 35:21.650
Farrell: GOING WHERE?

35:31.700 --> 35:34.233
YEAH, OKAY.

35:34.233 --> 35:37.206
I BORROWED SCOTT'S CAR.

35:39.208 --> 35:41.770
I HAD A MEETING WITH
THE COACH AT MARSTON PREP.

35:44.213 --> 35:46.415
WHAT,
WERE YOU JUST GONNA--

35:46.415 --> 35:47.776
YOU GONNA DITCH US IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE SEASON?

35:47.776 --> 35:49.318
IT WAS JUST A MEETING.
NOTHING CAME OF IT.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.522
THEY GO TO STATE EVERY YEAR.

35:53.522 --> 35:55.424
IT WAS JUST AN OPPORTUNITY
AND I JUST--

36:01.260 --> 36:03.262
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.

36:17.476 --> 36:18.577
( knocking on door )

36:23.482 --> 36:24.953
KAREN DESAI,

36:24.953 --> 36:26.785
I HAVE A WARRANT
TO SEARCH THE PREMISES.

36:26.785 --> 36:27.856
IT'S IN CONNECTION

36:27.856 --> 36:29.218
WITH THE MURDER
OF REGINA CRANE.

36:29.218 --> 36:30.689
THERE'S AN ITEM MISSING
FROM THE CRIME SCENE.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.461
WELL, IT'S NOT HERE.

36:32.461 --> 36:34.793
IF YOU DON'T LET US IN,
YOU'LL BE IN CONTEMPT OF COURT.

36:34.793 --> 36:36.765
DON'T FORCE ME
TO ARREST YOU, KAREN.

36:41.270 --> 36:43.332
KITCHEN.

36:43.332 --> 36:44.733
GUYS, UPSTAIRS BEDROOM.

36:44.733 --> 36:46.575
YES, SIR.

36:56.815 --> 36:58.917
REGINA'S UNCLE IS THE ATHLETIC
DIRECTOR AT MARSTON.

36:58.917 --> 37:00.389
SHE MADE THE DVD
TO HELP ME OUT.

37:00.389 --> 37:02.251
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
BECAUSE--

37:02.251 --> 37:03.392
I DIDN'T EVEN
TELL MY PARENTS.

37:03.392 --> 37:04.493
I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE
A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT

37:04.493 --> 37:05.554
UNLESS IT HAPPENED.

37:07.956 --> 37:09.858
LACEY, I'M SORRY.

37:09.858 --> 37:10.929
OKAY, I'M AN IDIOT.

37:10.929 --> 37:13.662
COACH JUST YELLED
AT ME FOR AN HOUR.

37:13.662 --> 37:14.803
THE TEAM'S FREEZING ME OUT.

37:14.803 --> 37:16.665
CAN YOU PLEASE
JUST FORGIVE ME?

37:35.824 --> 37:37.656
MOM?

37:37.656 --> 37:38.827
WHAT'S GOING ON?

37:46.335 --> 37:48.467
ANYTHING IN THE BEDROOM?

37:56.305 --> 37:57.746
OKAY, LET'S GO.

38:04.953 --> 38:06.014
YOU OKAY?

38:06.014 --> 38:07.786
I NEED A DRINK.

38:15.464 --> 38:16.595
HEY.

38:16.595 --> 38:18.327
I WENT TO YOUR HOUSE.

38:18.327 --> 38:19.998
YOUR MOM SAID
YOU MIGHT STILL BE HERE.

38:19.998 --> 38:22.771
I HAD TO TALK
TO ARCHIE.

38:22.771 --> 38:24.002
THE TEAM'S
PRETTY MAD AT HIM.

38:24.002 --> 38:26.475
I'M SORRY, LACEY.

38:26.475 --> 38:28.937
STEALING THAT WAS...

38:29.978 --> 38:31.910
WELL, I SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE IT SO...

38:33.982 --> 38:35.914
I'LL SEE YOU.

38:35.914 --> 38:39.418
WHY DID YOU EVEN
COME LAST NIGHT?

38:39.418 --> 38:42.591
I DON'T KNOW.

38:42.591 --> 38:44.052
MAYBE I JUST MISS

38:44.052 --> 38:46.094
US HANGING OUT.

38:46.094 --> 38:47.596
OBVIOUSLY NOT THAT MUCH

38:47.596 --> 38:49.358
SINCE YOU'RE WILLING
TO STEAL FROM ME.

38:49.358 --> 38:51.700
I'LL DO WHATEVER I HAVE TO DO
TO HELP DANNY.

38:51.700 --> 38:54.332
I HAVE TO BELIEVE
HE DIDN'T DO THIS.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.435
WHY?

38:59.868 --> 39:01.970
THE LAST FIVE YEARS
HAVE BEEN REALLY HARD.

39:01.970 --> 39:05.414
AND I JUST...

39:05.414 --> 39:08.517
FEEL LIKE I'M FINALLY
GETTING MY LIFE BACK, YOU KNOW?

39:08.517 --> 39:11.079
I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE THAT, LACEY.

39:11.079 --> 39:13.882
I CAN'T LOSE THAT.

39:24.433 --> 39:26.034
( doorbell rings )

39:26.034 --> 39:27.736
IT'S OPEN.

39:38.046 --> 39:39.478
WHAT HAPPENED?

39:39.478 --> 39:41.009
YOUR HUSBAND HAPPENED.

39:41.009 --> 39:42.881
HE HAD A WARRANT.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.813
HE DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING THOUGH.

39:44.813 --> 39:47.055
BUT HE CERTAINLY LOOKED.

39:47.055 --> 39:49.057
KAREN--

39:49.057 --> 39:51.920
ABOUT TODAY, I...

39:51.920 --> 39:55.524
I'M SORRY.
I HAD NO IDEA

39:55.524 --> 39:56.825
THAT GLORIA CRANE
WAS COMING.

39:56.825 --> 39:58.697
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T.

40:01.069 --> 40:03.432
I WAS SUCH AN IDIOT
TO GO TO THAT THING

40:03.432 --> 40:04.733
IN THE FIRST PLACE
ANYWAY.

40:04.733 --> 40:07.175
I MEAN, THE PEOPLE HERE,
THEY'RE NOT GONNA ACCEPT ME.

40:09.678 --> 40:10.839
I'M HERE, AREN'T I?

40:16.545 --> 40:18.416
WANT HELP CLEANING UP?

40:18.416 --> 40:20.489
IT'S OKAY.

40:20.489 --> 40:22.991
DANNY SAID HE'D HELP ME
WHEN HE GET'S BACK.

40:22.991 --> 40:25.053
MOTHER-SON BONDING, RIGHT?

40:31.059 --> 40:33.001
Jo: I MEAN, WHAT DID HE THINK
HE WAS GONNA FIND?

40:33.001 --> 40:36.735
LIKE A SECRET REGINA CRANE
SHRINE IN YOUR CLOSET?

40:36.735 --> 40:38.166
IT'S REALLY HARD
TO GET A WARRANT.

40:38.166 --> 40:40.108
OKAY, YOU HAVE TO HAVE
REALLY GOOD PROBABLE CAUSE

40:40.108 --> 40:41.610
OR LIKE SLEEP WITH
A JUDGE OR SOMETHING.

40:41.610 --> 40:42.871
( laughs )

40:42.871 --> 40:46.144
I KNOW WHAT
HE WAS LOOKING FOR.

40:49.878 --> 40:53.552
WHEN REGINA DIED
SHE WAS WEARING
MY AUNT TARA'S NECKLACE.

40:56.785 --> 40:58.226
OKAY, HOLD ON.

40:58.226 --> 41:01.129
THE NECKLACE REGINA WAS WEARING
WHEN SHE WAS MURDERED

41:01.129 --> 41:02.460
USED TO BELONG TO
THE PERSON YOU...

41:04.162 --> 41:05.894
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US THAT?

41:05.894 --> 41:08.166
I KNOW THIS
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

41:08.166 --> 41:12.240
OKAY, BUT HE DIDN'T
FIND ANYTHING OBVIOUSLY.

41:12.240 --> 41:15.173
SO WHEN REGINA SENT THE TEXT,
MAYBE SHE REALLY KNEW WHY

41:15.173 --> 41:16.174
YOU DID WHAT YOU DID.

41:16.174 --> 41:17.646
NO.

41:17.646 --> 41:19.508
NO, NO ONE KNOWS WHY.

41:19.508 --> 41:20.709
YOU DO.

41:23.481 --> 41:26.014
I CAN'T HELP YOU

41:26.014 --> 41:27.616
IF YOU DON'T TELL ME
WHAT YOU KNOW.

41:27.616 --> 41:31.019
ARE YOU SURE YOU
WANT TO HELP ME?

41:36.094 --> 41:37.596
TELL ME ABOUT
THE NECKLACE, DANNY.

41:39.167 --> 41:40.869
IT'S A FAMILY HEIRLOOM.

41:40.869 --> 41:43.031
IT BELONGED TO MY AUNT.

41:43.031 --> 41:45.804
IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO HER,
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY.

41:45.804 --> 41:49.077
I DON'T KNOW HOW
REGINA GOT A HOLD OF IT.

41:49.077 --> 41:53.542
BUT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO

41:53.542 --> 41:54.983
WITH WHY I DID WHAT I DID.

41:54.983 --> 41:56.184
YOU GOT TO BELIEVE ME.

41:58.186 --> 42:01.049
OKAY, JO, I GET IT.

42:01.049 --> 42:04.122
I GET WHY THIS
FREAKS YOU OUT.

42:04.122 --> 42:05.754
MAYBE IT'S JUST BETTER
IF YOU TAKE

42:05.754 --> 42:07.926
A COUPLE OF STEPS
BACK FROM ALL THIS.

42:07.926 --> 42:12.661
LET ME FIGURE IT OUT
BY MYSELF.

42:14.933 --> 42:17.265
( sighs )

42:17.265 --> 42:19.768
OKAY, UM...

42:19.768 --> 42:23.171
SOMEONE TOOK THAT NECKLACE
TO MAKE YOU LOOK GUILTY.

42:23.171 --> 42:28.176
SOMEONE WHO KNEW IT WOULD
CONNECT YOU TO THE CRIME.

42:28.176 --> 42:31.049
I KNOW.

42:31.049 --> 42:32.821
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

42:32.821 --> 42:35.323
I GUESS WE HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT

42:35.323 --> 42:37.155
HOW REGINA GOT
THAT NECKLACE

42:37.155 --> 42:39.187
AND WHO HAS IT NOW.

42:41.990 --> 42:44.162
IT MIGHT BE THE PERSON
THAT KILLED HER.
