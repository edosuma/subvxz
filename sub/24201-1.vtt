01:38.125 --> 01:39.875
You probably shouldn't be here.

01:42.625 --> 01:46.373
This is a secret passageway
in a restricted area

01:46.375 --> 01:50.708
about one third of the way through
a dreadful and upsetting story.

01:54.958 --> 01:56.581
My name is Lemony Snicket.

01:56.583 --> 02:00.304
If you've been following the story
as closely as some people have,

02:00.307 --> 02:02.758
then you know that
nobody should be here.

02:04.208 --> 02:07.373
'Cause everything about
the Baudelaires' situation

02:07.375 --> 02:08.804
is horrible to contemplate.

02:10.045 --> 02:12.093
Everything about the
Baudelaires' situation

02:12.096 --> 02:14.719
is delightful to
contemplate, Mr. Tamerlane.

02:14.722 --> 02:17.117
If you're interested in
stories with a happy ending,

02:17.120 --> 02:19.335
- you've come to the right place.
- Mm-hmm.

02:19.338 --> 02:22.711
Not only is there a happy
ending, there's a happy beginning

02:22.714 --> 02:25.540
and all sorts of happy
things in the middle.

02:25.542 --> 02:29.257
It's delightful and educational
and it's appropriate for families,

02:29.260 --> 02:32.341
a phrase here which means
"delightful and educational..."

02:32.344 --> 02:36.009
It features the three luckiest
children, who are darling and precocious,

02:36.012 --> 02:38.115
and have only cheerful
things happen to them.

02:38.118 --> 02:42.158
It's called A Pony Party, and I
can't put it down, Mr. Tamerlane.

02:42.160 --> 02:44.074
Poe, are you there?

02:44.076 --> 02:47.241
- Focus, Poe. What about the Baudelaires?
- Ah, yes, the Baudelaires.

02:47.243 --> 02:50.241
- Put down the book.
- I'll put this down.

02:50.243 --> 02:53.116
Surely, as you recall, from the
moment I told the Baudelaires

02:53.118 --> 02:55.199
their parents perished
in a terrible fire,

02:55.201 --> 02:59.658
they've had exciting adventures
in all sorts of exotic locales.

02:59.660 --> 03:02.473
From a house full of snakes
in the middle of nowhere,

03:02.476 --> 03:05.366
to a lake full of leeches in
the middle of hurricane season,

03:05.368 --> 03:07.866
and for complicated
reasons, a lumber mill.

03:07.868 --> 03:10.241
It's unclear why none of
the guardians worked out.

03:12.701 --> 03:14.658
The orphans are obsessed with the idea

03:14.660 --> 03:17.491
that an actor named Count
Olaf is obsessed with them,

03:17.493 --> 03:19.333
but they can never agree
on what he looks like.

03:20.785 --> 03:23.343
I'm unstoppable!

03:23.346 --> 03:24.969
I dropped them off at boarding school,

03:24.972 --> 03:26.780
where they'll receive the best education

03:26.783 --> 03:28.323
a heavily reduced tuition can buy.

03:28.326 --> 03:30.824
They're the second set of wealthy
orphans I've enrolled there.

03:30.826 --> 03:32.283
I'm sure there's no connection.

03:32.285 --> 03:34.949
With the Baudelaires safe at
Prufrock Preparatory School,

03:34.951 --> 03:37.991
I can assure you this bank's
troubles are finally over.

03:37.993 --> 03:41.368
- Prufrock Preparatory School?
- Yes, that's the name I just said.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.783
- Jacquelyn? It's my secretary.
- Poe?

03:48.785 --> 03:51.158
She must be taking another
unplanned sabbatical

03:51.160 --> 03:52.699
she swears I've authorized.

03:52.701 --> 03:53.616
What a moron.

03:53.618 --> 03:56.993
Yes, it is hard to find
good help, Mr. Tamerlane.

04:09.576 --> 04:12.074
I feel like we've been sitting
on this bench for months.

04:12.076 --> 04:13.366
We've been waiting so long,

04:13.368 --> 04:16.074
Sunny's starting to look less like
a baby and more like a toddler.

04:16.076 --> 04:17.761
_

04:17.764 --> 04:20.012
We've been tormented by
treachery and villainy.

04:20.015 --> 04:23.533
- Child labor and leeches.
- And now, a new school.

04:23.535 --> 04:26.241
Well, the new school
hasn't tormented us yet.

04:26.243 --> 04:28.366
Hello, cake-sniffers!

04:28.368 --> 04:30.616
- Hello, um...
- "Um..."

04:30.618 --> 04:34.335
Are you a blithering idiot?
Everyone knows I'm Carmelita Spats.

04:34.338 --> 04:37.366
I'm Violet Baudelaire, and these
are my siblings Klaus and Sunny.

04:37.368 --> 04:38.658
What does "cake-sniffer" mean?

04:38.660 --> 04:40.241
It means you're stupid cake-sniffers,

04:40.243 --> 04:42.783
but I'm the most special
girl in the whole school.

04:42.785 --> 04:44.491
I'm supposed to give you a tour.

04:44.493 --> 04:48.539
This is Vice Principal Nero's office.
He's a genius. He likes me best.

04:48.542 --> 04:52.209
I don't have to wear a uniform
'cause I'm too adorable. Come on.

04:53.535 --> 04:55.497
A school should be a safe place.

04:55.500 --> 04:59.033
Brand new season to explore
the mysteries around you.

04:59.035 --> 05:00.201
Come on, cake-sniffers.

05:00.993 --> 05:03.493
I don't think it's a compliment.

05:04.868 --> 05:06.866
It should be a place
to make new friends.

05:06.868 --> 05:09.991
I feel like we've been sitting
on this bench for months.

05:09.993 --> 05:14.658
It should be a place of comfort and
adventure that feels almost like home,

05:14.660 --> 05:18.326
particularly if your actual home
has been destroyed in a fire.

05:19.118 --> 05:22.910
But as you and I know, school
is hardly ever like that.

05:24.451 --> 05:27.491
- People are looking at us.
- Probably because we're new.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.868
It's because your home
was destroyed in a fire.

05:31.576 --> 05:33.283
Like this classroom,

05:33.285 --> 05:36.890
the lives of the Baudelaire orphans
may appear to be more or less harmless.

05:39.076 --> 05:40.533
But if you insist on watching,

05:40.535 --> 05:43.533
you should know the motto of
Prufrock Preparatory School.

05:43.535 --> 05:47.408
Like many mottoes, it can be
found on a variety of surfaces,

05:47.410 --> 05:50.491
from a banner in the school auditorium,

05:50.493 --> 05:53.116
to the scoreboard of the athletic field.

05:53.118 --> 05:55.991
This is the athletic field. Our
gym teacher's coaching an away game,

05:55.993 --> 05:59.449
so I get to make people do
jumping jacks whenever I want.

05:59.451 --> 06:00.616
"Memento mori."

06:00.618 --> 06:02.408
When you learn what it means,

06:02.410 --> 06:05.243
you will understand why this
story can have no happy ending,

06:06.285 --> 06:08.949
the way no story has a happy ending.

06:08.951 --> 06:10.910
What does "memento mori" mean?

06:14.701 --> 06:16.368
Remember, you will die.

06:19.993 --> 06:22.741
Larry, thank you for meeting
me on such short notice.

06:22.743 --> 06:23.991
That's a handsome wet suit.

06:23.993 --> 06:27.658
I enjoy scuba diving in the
off-season. What's the mission?

06:27.661 --> 06:29.590
You take this to the Baudelaires.

06:29.593 --> 06:32.074
It's been annotated with
answers to all their questions.

06:32.076 --> 06:35.783
They'll finally learn everything
about our secret organization.

06:35.785 --> 06:39.201
But only if you get it to them.
You can find them at this location.

06:41.388 --> 06:44.093
- Oh.
- You've heard of Prufrock Preparatory?

06:44.096 --> 06:45.449
I attended it.

06:45.451 --> 06:48.658
This trip is more than a crucial
mission for a secret organization.

06:48.661 --> 06:50.987
- It's a homecoming.
- Good luck with that.

06:50.990 --> 06:54.796
Prufrock Preparatory School...

06:55.868 --> 06:58.783
Well, well, well.

06:58.785 --> 07:00.991
Remember, you will die.

07:00.993 --> 07:03.491
When you die, you won't
think of your family.

07:03.493 --> 07:05.699
You won't think of your
friends or your career,

07:05.701 --> 07:08.824
or the way the land looks when
sun sets behind the mountains.

07:08.826 --> 07:12.658
You'll think of the day we
beat another team at sports!

07:12.660 --> 07:15.324
Prufrock! Prufrock! Prufrock!

07:15.326 --> 07:18.451
- Prufrock! Prufrock!
- There's somebody in the road.

07:26.326 --> 07:28.658
Hi. Uh, my catering truck broke down,

07:28.660 --> 07:31.285
and I need to get to Prufrock
Preparatory School right away.

07:36.243 --> 07:38.449
I see you brought something to read.

07:38.451 --> 07:41.283
- I never travel without a book.
- Nerd.

07:41.285 --> 07:44.741
Now where were we? Right, the
complete annihilation of...

07:46.993 --> 07:48.160
We must've blown a tire.

07:49.118 --> 07:52.866
I can fix it. I was Coach
of the Year, Berlin, '39.

07:52.868 --> 07:53.908
I'll be back.

07:56.451 --> 07:58.199
Is that a hook?

07:58.201 --> 08:00.991
It certainly is.

08:00.993 --> 08:02.201
I'll take that back now.

08:04.118 --> 08:08.699
What will happen to those members of
the pep squad you threw off the bus?

08:08.701 --> 08:11.093
- That gym teacher was crying.
- So was the driver.

08:11.096 --> 08:14.573
Ah. That touchy-feely nonsense
would never have been tolerated

08:14.576 --> 08:16.407
when I went to Prufrock Prep.

08:16.410 --> 08:19.324
Oh, you attended Prufrock
Preparatory? I'm impressed.

08:19.326 --> 08:23.658
You should be. My IQ has been
measured in the upper double digits.

08:23.660 --> 08:27.783
This trip is more than just a
chance to seize three children

08:27.785 --> 08:29.785
and also their enormous fortune.

08:31.535 --> 08:34.993
It's a homecoming.

08:39.034 --> 08:41.823
I don't know what that building
is. I never go in there.

08:41.826 --> 08:43.616
It says, "library."

08:43.618 --> 08:46.074
Only a cake-sniffer would
notice something like that.

08:46.076 --> 08:48.076
It's very clearly designated.

08:49.057 --> 08:53.699
Oh! Hello. You must be the new
students I've heard so much about.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.785
The Baudelaires, right?

08:56.493 --> 09:00.783
You shouldn't talk to the library
lady, because she smells funny.

09:00.785 --> 09:03.243
Carmelita, always a pleasure.

09:07.035 --> 09:09.866
A library is an island in
a vast sea of ignorance.

09:09.868 --> 09:11.896
Particularly if that library is tall and

09:11.899 --> 09:13.827
the surrounding area has been flooded.

09:17.076 --> 09:18.451
Let's go!

09:19.618 --> 09:20.716
Well...

09:26.036 --> 09:27.201
come visit.

09:40.868 --> 09:42.824
Here's Vice Principal Nero's office,

09:42.826 --> 09:45.824
where you were supposed to be
ten minutes ago. You're late.

09:45.826 --> 09:46.949
Ahem.

09:46.951 --> 09:48.451
- Ahem?
- Ahem.

09:49.450 --> 09:51.865
- Thank you?
- Thank you's not enough.

09:51.868 --> 09:55.158
It is traditional to give a
special tour guide a tip at the end.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.241
A tip?

09:56.243 --> 10:00.116
Yes, a tip! Are you deaf
and blind, cake-sniffer?

10:00.118 --> 10:03.991
Who dares to interrupt a
genius when he's rehearsing?

10:03.993 --> 10:07.449
It's the Baudelaires. They're
late for their appointment.

10:07.451 --> 10:09.824
How dare you be late!

10:09.826 --> 10:14.199
Thank you, Carmelita, for telling me.
Oh, that's a nice broach, by the way.

10:14.201 --> 10:16.910
- The original owner really liked it.
- Oh.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.533
Whoo!

10:19.535 --> 10:22.411
What a lovely girl. Sweet
as a butterscotch buttercup.

10:22.414 --> 10:23.910
She has two living parents.

10:27.118 --> 10:29.243
Well, come in. I don't
have all afternoon.

10:43.326 --> 10:44.505
How do you do?

11:09.493 --> 11:11.408
When you hear an incredible performance,

11:11.410 --> 11:15.076
it's tradition to clap
and cheer and yell "Bravo!"

11:16.993 --> 11:18.743
- Yay!
- Mmm, bravo.

11:19.576 --> 11:21.743
Thank you. Thank you very much.

11:22.868 --> 11:25.291
And welcome, new students.

11:25.294 --> 11:27.576
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

11:28.285 --> 11:30.771
My name is Vice Principal Nero,
and my second-highest concern

11:30.774 --> 11:34.491
is that you uphold the strict
standards here at Prufrock.

11:34.493 --> 11:35.991
What's your first-highest concern?

11:35.993 --> 11:37.658
My career as a violinist.

11:37.660 --> 11:39.199
I know all about you.

11:39.208 --> 11:42.903
You've been to guardian after guardian,
and adversity has always followed.

11:42.906 --> 11:44.949
Adversity means "trouble," by the way.

11:44.951 --> 11:46.790
In our case, adversity means Count Olaf.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.449
He was the cause of all our trouble.

11:48.451 --> 11:50.658
Here at Prufrock Preparatory School,

11:50.660 --> 11:54.493
there'll be no blaming your own
weaknesses on this Count Olaf person.

11:58.618 --> 12:01.449
This is an advanced computer
system. Cost an arm and a leg.

12:01.451 --> 12:05.991
But I had the AV club program it to
recognize the hallmarks of Count Olaf.

12:05.993 --> 12:08.073
One eyebrow, tattoo on ankle.

12:10.785 --> 12:13.449
This is not Count Olaf.

12:13.451 --> 12:15.616
We'll park it outside
the school all semester,

12:15.618 --> 12:16.866
and you'll be safe as peas.

12:16.869 --> 12:17.890
_

12:17.893 --> 12:20.699
I'm not sure an advanced
computer will do us much good.

12:20.701 --> 12:23.366
- Olaf is usually in disguise...
- Oh, I shouldn't have bothered.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.991
No way ordinary orphans can
understand a genius like me.

12:25.993 --> 12:28.618
Prufrock Prep will take care of that.

12:29.284 --> 12:33.234
Prufrock Preparatory has
a magnificent dormitory

12:33.237 --> 12:37.326
thanks to a generous grant from
our founder, Sir Barrymore Feint.

12:41.659 --> 12:46.240
Inside, there is a huge living room and
an ornate cage full of tropical birds

12:46.243 --> 12:48.432
who can land on your
finger and learn your name.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.783
- Doesn't it look nice?
- It looks more than nice.

12:50.785 --> 12:53.533
It looks better than any place
we've lived in a long time.

12:53.536 --> 12:58.635
Oh, I'm so glad to hear you say that,
although you won't get to see it much.

12:58.638 --> 13:00.283
In order to live in the dormitory,

13:00.285 --> 13:03.324
you must have a permission slip
signed by a parent or a guardian,

13:03.326 --> 13:04.616
and your parents are dead.

13:04.618 --> 13:07.490
Mr. Poe tells me your guardians
have either been killed or fired you.

13:07.493 --> 13:08.991
Surely Mr. Poe could sign.

13:08.993 --> 13:11.408
"Surely Mr. Poe could
sign." He could not.

13:11.410 --> 13:14.158
He is neither your parent nor
your guardian. He works at a bank.

13:14.160 --> 13:19.427
I'm afraid that you'll have
to live in a small tin shack.

13:20.758 --> 13:23.008
Oh, it's a dismal place.

13:23.701 --> 13:27.658
You'll stay there until we
get a new set of orphans.

13:27.660 --> 13:31.199
And then you'll be
upgraded to a broom closet.

13:31.201 --> 13:33.783
Why can't you change the rule
so everyone lives in a dorm?

13:33.785 --> 13:37.160
"Why can't you change the rule
so everyone lives in a dorm?"

13:40.618 --> 13:41.576
I don't want to.

13:42.410 --> 13:46.616
Speaking of rules, if either
of you are late to your classes,

13:46.618 --> 13:49.574
your hands will be tied
behind your back during meals

13:49.576 --> 13:52.408
and you'll have to lean down
and eat your food like a dog.

13:52.410 --> 13:55.991
Violet, you will be studying
with Mr. Remora in room one,

13:55.993 --> 13:59.283
and Klaus, you will be
with Mrs. Bass in room two,

13:59.285 --> 14:01.616
which is easy to remember
if you think of Tu B'Shevat,

14:01.618 --> 14:03.243
the Jewish equivalent of Arbor Day.

14:04.660 --> 14:06.241
Thank you. I'll remember.

14:06.243 --> 14:07.574
Which classroom is Sunny's?

14:07.576 --> 14:10.699
I told Mr. Poe that we would
have room for a baby here,

14:10.701 --> 14:12.076
but not in a classroom.

14:13.076 --> 14:15.699
I've always wanted an
administrative assistant,

14:15.701 --> 14:17.535
but there was never a budget for it.

14:18.368 --> 14:19.535
Now, I have Sunny.

14:21.076 --> 14:22.326
Off to your shack!

14:23.451 --> 14:26.410
Genius needs his rehearsal time. Go, go.

14:32.743 --> 14:34.201
What now?

14:35.910 --> 14:37.243
Children!

14:38.535 --> 14:41.199
Vice Principal Nero, you
said you wanted to see us?

14:41.201 --> 14:43.116
We've been waiting
for a really long time.

14:43.118 --> 14:45.201
Come in, come in, come in.

14:46.285 --> 14:50.910
So, orphans, how would you like
to move into a broom closet?

14:58.035 --> 15:01.074
This place has hardly
changed since I was expelled.

15:01.076 --> 15:03.199
What do you want us to do
with the stuff on the bus?

15:03.201 --> 15:04.658
We may have use for it.

15:04.660 --> 15:07.408
Matriculating into
Prufrock Prep won't be easy.

15:07.410 --> 15:10.824
I was quite the disciplinary problem
during my semester and a half.

15:10.826 --> 15:13.824
You think they'll recognize
you and they're still mad?

15:13.826 --> 15:15.410
Why wouldn't they be?

15:18.035 --> 15:19.910
Nothing. No reason.

15:20.660 --> 15:23.618
It was just... It was a long time...

15:26.451 --> 15:28.324
- Let's see what we got.
- Let's.

15:28.326 --> 15:30.783
- Mascot costume, front half.
- Good.

15:30.785 --> 15:33.158
- Mascot costume, back half.
- Better.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.908
- Thirty-two hot dogs, 31 hot dog buns.
- Intriguing.

15:35.910 --> 15:38.616
A variety of pennants, cheerleader
uniforms, sweaty clothes,

15:38.618 --> 15:40.824
Hula-Hoops and one school banner.

15:40.826 --> 15:42.535
- Okay.
- That's everything.

15:44.660 --> 15:46.282
That...

15:46.285 --> 15:50.533
We are going to hatch a complicated
plot, and these are our raw materials?

15:50.535 --> 15:52.993
The hot dogs are actually precooked.

15:53.951 --> 15:57.035
Must I do everything myself?

16:00.951 --> 16:02.910
I know you're hiding somewhere.

16:20.493 --> 16:24.618
Well, well. What do we have here?

16:26.826 --> 16:29.449
- You told me you got everything.
- We did.

16:29.451 --> 16:31.743
Then explain that...

16:32.785 --> 16:34.118
to these!

16:48.910 --> 16:51.866
Let's move out. Curses!

16:51.868 --> 16:54.074
This is not Count Olaf.

16:54.076 --> 16:56.033
This is going to be
harder than I thought.

16:56.035 --> 16:57.074
What do we do?

16:57.076 --> 16:59.116
The same thing that got
me through eighth grade.

16:59.118 --> 17:00.826
Find a safe place to hide.

17:07.660 --> 17:08.991
Vice Principal Nero?

17:08.992 --> 17:11.532
I don't mean to interrupt a
genius when he's rehearsing...

17:11.535 --> 17:12.907
I was already interrupted.

17:12.910 --> 17:15.074
I just spent 20 minutes
explaining to three orphans

17:15.076 --> 17:17.116
- that they have to live in a shack.
- That's awful.

17:17.117 --> 17:18.866
We always put new orphans in the shack.

17:18.867 --> 17:21.742
No, I mean it's awful that it
took you 20 minutes to explain it.

17:24.035 --> 17:26.326
- Hmm. Why are you here?
- Why are any of us here?

17:27.242 --> 17:29.324
"Life is thickly sown with thorns,

17:29.326 --> 17:32.491
and I know no other remedy than
to pass quickly through them."

17:32.493 --> 17:33.741
Voltaire said that.

17:33.743 --> 17:35.824
I thought we expelled that
French kid for smoking.

17:35.826 --> 17:40.074
I'm following up on keeping the library
open for more than ten minutes...

17:40.076 --> 17:42.283
No! Out of the question.

17:42.285 --> 17:44.366
I spent the budget on a
violin case with a ruby handle.

17:44.368 --> 17:48.199
But it doesn't cost more money to
leave the library door unlocked.

17:48.201 --> 17:51.241
There are other reasons, but
I don't have time to explain.

17:51.243 --> 17:52.866
Then I'll wait.

17:57.993 --> 17:59.243
Okay.

18:01.535 --> 18:04.285
It's because I don't like you very much.

18:07.410 --> 18:09.910
My hands are tied on this!

18:13.410 --> 18:14.530
You dropped this.

18:15.160 --> 18:18.033
I wish I had dropped
it right on his head.

18:18.035 --> 18:20.783
Too bad we can't fix stupidity
at the vice principal level.

18:20.785 --> 18:23.283
In a world governed by
corruption and arrogance,

18:23.285 --> 18:26.699
it can be difficult to stay true to one's
literary and philosophical principles.

18:26.701 --> 18:29.283
I've often thought that exact thing.

18:29.285 --> 18:32.408
- Most librarians have.
- Oh! How did you know I was a librarian?

18:32.410 --> 18:36.033
There's a certain gleam in the eye
indicating a sharp, erudite acumen.

18:36.035 --> 18:37.408
Also, you have a cart of books.

18:37.410 --> 18:39.951
Do you know where I might find
three children who recently enrolled?

18:39.954 --> 18:42.866
I do, but I don't think I
should share that information

18:42.868 --> 18:44.366
with someone who's not faculty.

18:44.368 --> 18:47.201
- I'm a member of the faculty.
- I've never seen you around.

18:48.076 --> 18:50.285
I work in the cafeteria.

18:51.660 --> 18:55.616
Ah. That checks out. I make
it a point to never eat there.

18:55.618 --> 18:58.283
- Ah, hello, little girl.
- Who said you could speak to me?

19:05.160 --> 19:08.743
Oh, my! Here. Let me help you. Oh!

19:11.868 --> 19:15.076
- Children can be cruel.
- The whole world is cruel.

19:15.785 --> 19:19.366
School is just a microcosm.

19:19.368 --> 19:21.949
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Why do you ask?

19:21.951 --> 19:23.908
The cafeteria's the other way.

19:23.910 --> 19:25.701
But the nurse is this way.

19:45.826 --> 19:48.908
The expression "making a
mountain out of a molehill"

19:48.910 --> 19:51.616
simply means making a big
deal out of a small deal.

19:51.618 --> 19:54.199
It's easy to see how this
expression came about.

19:54.201 --> 19:58.824
Molehills are mounds of earth serving
as condominiums for small mammals.

19:58.826 --> 20:00.949
And they have never
caused anyone any harm,

20:00.951 --> 20:04.491
except for maybe a stubbed toe
if you're being pushed by a bully.

20:04.493 --> 20:06.574
- Hey!
- I hate your face!

20:06.576 --> 20:09.866
Mountains, however, are
very large mounds of earth

20:09.868 --> 20:11.783
and are constantly causing problems.

20:11.785 --> 20:15.491
From frostbite to border
disputes, hang gliding mishaps.

20:15.493 --> 20:18.408
Which is why when we
call something a mountain,

20:18.410 --> 20:21.035
we mean that it is a
large amount of trouble.

20:23.035 --> 20:26.616
When Nero described the shack
where the Baudelaires were living,

20:26.618 --> 20:29.076
he was not making a
mountain out of a molehill.

20:30.285 --> 20:32.368
- If anything...
- It's small.

20:33.201 --> 20:35.033
Even for a shack.

20:35.035 --> 20:37.699
He was making a molehill
out of a mountain.

20:37.701 --> 20:40.118
- Uh, crabs!
- Our shack has crabs!

20:46.993 --> 20:48.285
Fungus.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.368
Our shack has dripping fungus.

20:59.410 --> 21:02.201
Their shack had misinformation.

21:08.118 --> 21:10.241
- This is ridiculous.
- We can fix it up a little.

21:10.243 --> 21:12.328
I don't mean this shack,
I mean this school.

21:12.331 --> 21:14.741
Orphans shouldn't be punished
for not having parents.

21:14.743 --> 21:16.908
And who ties people's hands
behind their backs to eat?

21:16.910 --> 21:19.949
I know, but we have to think
about the bigger picture.

21:19.951 --> 21:22.283
Our parents were part of
something. Our guardians, too.

21:22.285 --> 21:24.533
It might be why these
terrible things keep happening.

21:24.535 --> 21:26.175
We'll never find out
if we're stuck here.

21:26.785 --> 21:28.868
This is a school. Let's
see what we can learn.

21:51.243 --> 21:53.785
Good morning, class,
including our latest orphan.

21:59.451 --> 22:02.199
My name is Mr. Remora, and
today, for language arts,

22:02.201 --> 22:06.408
I will continue telling anecdotes
from my own life that I find amusing.

22:06.410 --> 22:09.366
You'll take notes, and
there will be a test.

22:09.368 --> 22:11.491
Okay, one day, I think it was a Tuesday,

22:11.493 --> 22:14.491
I was in the mood for macaroni
and cheese, so I said to myself,

22:14.493 --> 22:18.158
"Today, Tuesday, I think I'll
have some macaroni and cheese."

22:18.160 --> 22:20.366
It's important to remember
it wasn't elbow macaroni

22:20.368 --> 22:23.783
or the decorative butterfly kind,
or even the tube-shaped macaroni.

22:23.785 --> 22:25.283
Indeed, it was not...

22:25.285 --> 22:29.035
Good morning, children. May I
have your undivided attention?

22:29.743 --> 22:32.285
And that includes you, Daniel.

22:33.951 --> 22:36.868
I understand we have a
brand new orphan today.

22:41.493 --> 22:45.699
It must be difficult for you to measure
how unhappy you are without your parents,

22:45.701 --> 22:46.618
but we're gonna try.

22:47.326 --> 22:49.449
My name is Mrs. Bass,

22:49.451 --> 22:52.074
and we'll continue our
lessons on the metric system

22:52.076 --> 22:53.866
by measuring various objects.

22:53.868 --> 22:55.658
Later we'll have a quiz.

22:55.660 --> 22:58.949
The first thing to measure
is this jar of mayonnaise

22:58.951 --> 23:00.826
I found in my garage.

23:01.576 --> 23:02.670
Next letter.

23:02.673 --> 23:05.715
"Dear Juilliard School of Music,

23:06.243 --> 23:11.574
I was confused by your
restraining order of October 13th."

23:11.576 --> 23:13.410
Faster! You type like a one-year-old!

23:15.076 --> 23:16.076
Where was I?

23:17.326 --> 23:19.910
"Dear Juilliard School of Music,

23:20.951 --> 23:26.635
I was baffled by your restraining
order of October the 13th.

23:26.638 --> 23:28.324
What did I do?"

23:28.326 --> 23:30.041
Call those jumping jacks?

23:30.044 --> 23:33.408
I've seen better jumping
jacks from old people!

23:33.410 --> 23:37.074
Hiding under the bleachers again,
just like so many youthful days

23:37.076 --> 23:40.368
spent hatching plans and
looking for cigarette butts.

23:41.035 --> 23:43.283
Were you unpopular?
I know how that feels.

23:43.285 --> 23:45.574
No. I was a rebel.

23:45.577 --> 23:47.648
I bet people were jealous of your looks.

23:47.651 --> 23:49.362
Unless you were a late bloomer.

23:49.365 --> 23:51.491
I was not a late bloomer.

23:51.493 --> 23:53.741
Girls were falling
all over me in school,

23:53.743 --> 23:56.324
and not just because I extended
my leg when they walked by.

23:56.326 --> 24:01.574
I was a lone wolf, a mysterious
stranger, a member of the drama club.

24:01.576 --> 24:02.783
Mmm.

24:02.785 --> 24:05.408
This school is obviously
desperate for my return,

24:05.410 --> 24:09.033
but that advanced computer prevents
us from waltzing in the front door.

24:09.035 --> 24:11.158
We need someone on the inside,

24:11.160 --> 24:15.741
a student who will help us infiltrate,
if infiltrate is what I mean.

24:15.743 --> 24:19.074
Do you mean "to penetrate an
institution surreptitiously"?

24:19.076 --> 24:20.451
What kid's gonna help us?

24:21.243 --> 24:22.699
Hey, cake-sniffer!

24:22.701 --> 24:26.116
You're as ugly as something
I found in my teeth recently!

24:26.118 --> 24:27.368
Little girl.

24:28.576 --> 24:32.366
Little girl? I'm 4' 7".

24:32.368 --> 24:34.618
That's a pretty broach you have.

24:37.326 --> 24:40.033
- Make me an offer.
- I like you.

24:40.035 --> 24:43.241
- You're not an orphan, are you?
- Do I look like I live in a shack?

24:43.243 --> 24:45.199
Mmm.

24:45.201 --> 24:47.410
Meet me under the
bleachers after school.

24:53.326 --> 24:56.449
- How was your day?
- I heard nothing but pointless stories.

24:56.451 --> 24:57.866
That's language arts.

24:57.868 --> 25:00.158
I spent the morning writing
meaningless measurements.

25:00.160 --> 25:01.993
That's math. How was work?

25:07.035 --> 25:09.324
We've been in class all day
but haven't learned a thing.

25:09.326 --> 25:11.699
There has to be someone who
can answer all our questions.

25:11.701 --> 25:14.491
- Hello, I'm Larry, your waiter.
- We know you.

25:14.494 --> 25:17.286
Of course you do. I work in
the cafeteria. See my hairnet?

25:17.289 --> 25:20.310
We've met before. You were
the waiter at Lake Lachrymose.

25:20.313 --> 25:22.416
- You were dressed as a clown.
- You gave us peppermints.

25:22.419 --> 25:25.658
Uh, peppermints are not a
recognized part of the lunch program,

25:25.660 --> 25:27.324
but I do have something to give you.

25:27.326 --> 25:29.408
- Does it have to do with our parents?
- Our guardians?

25:29.410 --> 25:31.491
_

25:31.493 --> 25:34.618
All your questions will be
answered as soon as I give you...

25:37.951 --> 25:41.118
Wait, I'm sure it's in here somewhere.

25:43.368 --> 25:44.574
Out of my way.

25:44.576 --> 25:47.074
I deserve a heaping portion
because I'm heapingly adorable.

25:47.076 --> 25:50.908
- You can wait in line like everyone else.
- Where is it? Where is it?

25:50.910 --> 25:53.741
I don't have to. I don't have to
do anything I don't want to do.

25:53.743 --> 25:55.449
Vice Principal Nero likes me best,

25:55.451 --> 25:59.699
and there's a beef and bean burrito
with a ribbon on it just for me.

25:59.701 --> 26:02.991
This is my lunch that
I brought from home.

26:02.993 --> 26:04.910
- What did you have for us?
- Give it to me.

26:06.076 --> 26:07.866
Explain how adorable I am!

26:07.868 --> 26:10.576
- Look at her pinafore!
- Look at her pretty face!

26:11.326 --> 26:14.033
- Sorry. I have to look for something.
- What were you gonna give us?

26:14.035 --> 26:14.993
Uh...

26:18.493 --> 26:21.785
Macaroni and cheese...
and boiled wieners!

26:22.535 --> 26:24.035
No, thank you.

26:35.743 --> 26:37.783
I guess they were late to class.

26:37.785 --> 26:40.658
As if eating cafeteria
food isn't punishing enough.

26:40.660 --> 26:43.199
Baudelaires, there's seats at my table,

26:43.201 --> 26:47.908
but I'm afraid it's a
cake-sniffer-free zone.

26:47.910 --> 26:50.388
Cake-sniffing orphans
in the Orphan Shack!

26:50.449 --> 26:53.008
Cake-sniffing orphans
in the Orphan Shack!

26:53.011 --> 26:57.908
Cake-sniffing orphans
in the Orphan Shack!

26:57.910 --> 27:00.366
Leave them alone.
You're the cake-sniffer.

27:00.368 --> 27:03.076
Nobody in their right mind
would want to eat with you.

27:04.368 --> 27:05.743
Come sit with us.

27:07.285 --> 27:08.741
You'll have to forgive Carmelita.

27:08.743 --> 27:11.908
She's so awful, Mrs. Bass is
considering a life of crime.

27:11.910 --> 27:13.616
My sister wrote a poem about her.

27:13.618 --> 27:15.851
"I would rather eat
a bowl of vampire bats

27:15.854 --> 27:18.033
than spend an hour
with Carmelita Spats."

27:18.035 --> 27:20.271
That's a couplet. Ogden Nash uses them.

27:20.274 --> 27:22.625
I know. I've read all of his work.

27:23.222 --> 27:25.387
I'm Isadora Quagmire, and
this is my brother Duncan.

27:25.390 --> 27:28.305
I'm Violet Baudelaire, and
this is Klaus and Sunny.

27:28.308 --> 27:29.516
Nice to meet you.

27:32.464 --> 27:34.199
_

27:34.201 --> 27:37.039
We should warn you, the
apples taste like horseradish.

27:37.042 --> 27:39.449
Everything seems
distasteful in this place.

27:39.451 --> 27:41.116
I hope you're surviving
the Orphan Shack.

27:41.118 --> 27:43.766
It's pretty awful. We were
living there until yesterday.

27:43.769 --> 27:45.035
You're orphans?

27:45.038 --> 27:49.241
We lost our parents in a terrible
fire. And our brother, Quigley.

27:49.243 --> 27:50.574
We were triplets.

27:50.576 --> 27:54.743
- We're sorry to hear that.
- We lost our parents in a fire as well.

27:56.076 --> 27:59.951
It's not fair. One minute
you're safe and happy and...

28:01.993 --> 28:04.951
- home, and the next...
- You're in a shack full of crabs.

28:05.701 --> 28:09.074
We can do something about the
crabs. How did you deal with them?

28:09.076 --> 28:11.949
We taped metal to our
shoes to be extra noisy.

28:11.951 --> 28:15.366
It scared the crabs, but it was
exhausting to tap dance all the time.

28:15.368 --> 28:16.741
Nobody likes tap dancing.

28:16.743 --> 28:18.241
Cake-sniffing orphans

28:18.243 --> 28:19.658
in the Orphan Shack!

28:19.660 --> 28:22.535
Cake-sniffing orphans
in the Orphan Shack!

28:24.451 --> 28:27.658
She's been even worse since
Nero got her those shoes.

28:27.660 --> 28:29.866
I can invent something less
exhausting than tap shoes.

28:29.868 --> 28:32.201
I'll need materials. Can
everybody empty their pockets?

28:52.868 --> 28:54.616
Where did you get that?

28:54.618 --> 28:56.535
From the ruins of our parents' home.

29:00.326 --> 29:02.326
I think we need to talk.

29:05.785 --> 29:08.449
We found it in the ashes.
We'd never seen it before.

29:08.451 --> 29:11.824
Can't be a coincidence. Two
fires, two halves of a spyglass.

29:11.826 --> 29:13.449
I think it's more than a spyglass.

29:13.451 --> 29:16.824
There are dials, similar to ones
I read about for cracking codes.

29:16.826 --> 29:19.116
Why would our parents have
a device for cracking codes?

29:19.118 --> 29:21.658
Why would ours have the same device?

29:21.660 --> 29:22.908
They must've known each other.

29:22.910 --> 29:26.324
Why don't we know each other? It's
like they were hiding all this stuff.

29:26.326 --> 29:27.326
Thanks, Sunny.

29:28.826 --> 29:32.158
Maybe they were gonna tell
us, but never got the chance.

29:32.160 --> 29:35.324
- Maybe they were hiding it for a reason.
- Because it's dangerous?

29:35.326 --> 29:37.408
Maybe. You're sure you've
never heard of Count Olaf?

29:37.410 --> 29:40.241
I'm sure. But since we lost our parents,

29:40.243 --> 29:41.949
we've seen things we can't explain.

29:41.951 --> 29:44.118
Us, too. It has to be connected.

29:53.660 --> 29:54.743
That's a little better.

29:57.243 --> 30:00.324
It's scaring the crabs and it
gives the place a little style.

30:00.326 --> 30:01.285
That's a lot better.

30:03.451 --> 30:07.199
At Aunt Josephine's, we found a
book that might contain some answers.

30:07.201 --> 30:09.616
We lost it in a hurricane
before we could read it.

30:09.618 --> 30:10.658
Did it look like this?

30:10.660 --> 30:14.116
Our last guardian locked it in
a safe after she lost her wife.

30:14.118 --> 30:16.616
If we saw the same book,
there has to be more copies.

30:16.618 --> 30:18.991
- How can we find one?
- Is the library open?

30:18.993 --> 30:20.491
Not for long.

30:20.493 --> 30:23.116
Get out of here. Give
this a decent burial.

30:23.118 --> 30:25.074
You told me you like
To Kill a Mockingbird,

30:25.076 --> 30:26.283
so I did it for you.

30:26.285 --> 30:27.490
This is your last chance.

30:27.493 --> 30:28.741
Next time, I call your mother

30:28.743 --> 30:30.826
and steal your shoes.

30:34.410 --> 30:37.699
I smell people who lost
their parents in fires.

30:40.784 --> 30:43.698
Quagmires and the Baudelaires.

30:43.701 --> 30:46.449
Lovely to see you, and
together, I might add.

30:46.451 --> 30:47.526
Are you still open?

30:47.529 --> 30:50.752
I'm afraid I was just locking
up. Ten minutes goes by fast.

30:50.755 --> 30:53.991
- You can come back tomorrow.
- We can't wait. Please.

30:53.993 --> 30:55.741
- We're trying to find a book.
- An important book.

30:55.743 --> 30:56.908
It might have the answers

30:56.910 --> 30:58.823
- to all of our questions.
- What's the title?

30:58.826 --> 31:00.868
The Incomplete History
of Secret Organizations.

31:01.535 --> 31:03.118
Let me see what I can do.

31:07.910 --> 31:11.241
We only have a few minutes
before Nero comes on his rounds.

31:11.243 --> 31:14.158
If he catches you, he'll
make you trim his toenails.

31:14.160 --> 31:15.616
- He wouldn't.
- He would.

31:15.618 --> 31:16.908
He would.

31:16.910 --> 31:19.074
You don't happen to know
its Dewey Decimal number?

31:19.076 --> 31:20.658
We don't even know who wrote it.

31:20.660 --> 31:22.951
That's okay. That's what I'm here for.

31:24.910 --> 31:30.118
Let's see. Incomplete History
of Secret Organizations, The.

31:37.117 --> 31:39.073
- I'm sorry.
- You don't have it.

31:39.076 --> 31:41.533
Due to budget cuts,
crumbling infrastructure,

31:41.535 --> 31:43.760
and the priorities of a
certain vice principal,

31:43.763 --> 31:46.866
this place has become something
of a faltering institution.

31:46.868 --> 31:50.326
Although, I do have a few other
books that I think you might like.

31:51.951 --> 31:54.118
The Incomplete History of Treachery?

31:56.826 --> 32:00.243
The Incomplete History
of Pretentiousness?

32:02.368 --> 32:04.826
Or, The Incomplete History of History?

32:07.493 --> 32:09.618
That does sound fascinating, but...

32:10.701 --> 32:11.826
I know.

32:12.743 --> 32:15.324
In every library, there is a single book

32:15.326 --> 32:18.783
to answer the question that
burns like a fire in the mind.

32:18.785 --> 32:20.616
Where did you hear that?

32:20.618 --> 32:22.951
I don't know. I must have
read it somewhere. Why?

32:24.285 --> 32:25.826
Our father said that once.

32:27.160 --> 32:30.491
It's awful to have people
missing from your life.

32:30.493 --> 32:33.033
It's like a question that haunts you,

32:33.035 --> 32:36.533
and you never know if that
question will ever be answered.

32:36.535 --> 32:40.199
We think it might be,
with the right book.

32:40.201 --> 32:41.076
I see.

32:41.951 --> 32:44.866
Well, a friend of mine is
sending me some new titles

32:44.868 --> 32:48.366
now that she's abandoned her dissertation
to become a welterweight boxer.

32:48.368 --> 32:51.576
I'll ask her about it. Check
back with me in a day or so.

32:53.118 --> 32:54.449
Mind if we have a look around?

32:56.368 --> 32:57.658
- Drat.
- Drat?

32:57.660 --> 33:00.365
Vice Principal Nero will be here in...

33:00.368 --> 33:02.283
"Vice Principal Nero will be here."

33:02.285 --> 33:05.951
Vice Principal Nero is already here, and
this library is supposed to be closed!

33:06.701 --> 33:10.560
It is closed, and it's empty.
You must be having a bad dream.

33:12.410 --> 33:14.783
- That only worked on me once.
- Darn it.

33:14.785 --> 33:17.324
Report to the athletic
field in ten minutes.

33:17.326 --> 33:18.491
Attendance is mandatory.

33:18.493 --> 33:20.417
Mandatory means "anyone who doesn't come

33:20.420 --> 33:23.090
has to buy me candy
and watch me eat it."

33:23.093 --> 33:25.627
- He wouldn't.
- He would.

33:25.630 --> 33:27.339
I would.

33:28.743 --> 33:30.449
This is a very exciting day for me,

33:30.451 --> 33:32.991
so you orphans and you
twins should be excited.

33:32.993 --> 33:34.824
The Quagmires are triplets.

33:34.826 --> 33:37.741
"Twins" is what you call triplets
when one has burned to a crisp.

33:37.743 --> 33:41.533
If you'll excuse me, I have to
get my violin for the pep rally.

33:41.535 --> 33:43.866
Welcome to Prufrock Prep, Baudelaires.

33:43.868 --> 33:47.241
In a world too often governed
by corruption and arrogance,

33:47.243 --> 33:52.158
it can be difficult to stay true to one's
philosophical and literary principles.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.324
We wholeheartedly agree.

33:53.326 --> 33:56.074
All decent people do.

33:56.076 --> 33:57.533
I wanted to find that book.

33:57.535 --> 33:59.366
We still could. We'll make a plan.

33:59.368 --> 34:01.491
I don't know what's worse,
the word "pep" or "rally."

34:01.493 --> 34:04.116
- They last for hours.
- We'll sneak in some fruit.

34:04.118 --> 34:06.699
- We'll bring some for you, too.
- Thank you.

34:06.701 --> 34:09.283
It's no trouble. Our broom
closet's next to the fruit bowl.

34:09.284 --> 34:12.991
I don't mean for the fruit. I
mean for making us feel at home.

34:12.993 --> 34:15.241
We haven't felt at home for a long time.

34:15.243 --> 34:16.866
I'm sure you already know.

34:16.868 --> 34:19.118
- What?
- What friends are for.

34:20.826 --> 34:22.029
See you soon.

34:27.326 --> 34:29.824
Remember what you learned
in lock-picking school.

34:29.826 --> 34:34.158
You have to break in, get the book, give
it to the Baudelaires, quit your job,

34:34.159 --> 34:36.574
then you never have to come
back to this school again.

34:36.576 --> 34:38.949
- Unless it's a reunion.
- You're breaking in.

34:38.951 --> 34:41.866
Uh, no, I'm not. I mean,
it's okay, I'm a grown-up.

34:41.868 --> 34:44.074
- I'm telling Nero.
- You don't have to do that.

34:44.076 --> 34:47.574
All I have to do is scream
and he'll fire you on the spot.

34:47.576 --> 34:49.824
Unless you give me something.

34:49.826 --> 34:52.505
I already gave you half of my burrito.

34:54.701 --> 34:56.199
Fine, fine!

34:56.201 --> 34:59.033
Tell me what you want, what
you really, really want.

34:59.035 --> 35:01.160
Oh, I'll tell you what I want,

35:01.951 --> 35:06.118
what I really, really want.

35:16.160 --> 35:18.660
Hello, hello, hello.

35:20.035 --> 35:23.701
What are helpless orphans like
you doing in a place like this?

35:24.326 --> 35:27.283
- Who are you?
- Don't pretend this handsome face

35:27.285 --> 35:30.283
doesn't haunt your every
waking and sleeping hour.

35:30.285 --> 35:32.283
You will never be rid of me.

35:32.285 --> 35:34.033
You'll never be safe.

35:34.035 --> 35:39.866
So much to learn, orphans,
and I am here to school you.

35:39.868 --> 35:42.658
The three of you better... Wait.

35:42.660 --> 35:45.908
You two better... Wait.
Where's the midget?

35:45.910 --> 35:46.868
One, two...

35:49.243 --> 35:51.116
You're not the Baudelaires. Who are you?

35:51.118 --> 35:52.660
Who are you, you miscreant?

35:53.785 --> 35:55.660
Miscreant?

35:56.368 --> 35:59.991
Oh, I know who you are now.

35:59.993 --> 36:03.616
- You sound just like your mother, Quigley.
- Duncan.

36:03.618 --> 36:08.033
"You miscreant, never again will
you darken the doors of this hangar."

36:08.035 --> 36:09.616
Such a tiresome woman.

36:09.618 --> 36:13.324
Always reading Italian poetry
and activating trap doors.

36:13.326 --> 36:16.949
- How do you know our mother?
- Oh, I know everything, orphans.

36:16.951 --> 36:20.074
I know the number of hairs
on each of your heads,

36:20.076 --> 36:22.616
the number of sapphires
in your secret vaults.

36:22.618 --> 36:25.949
The number of tombstones
in your family plots.

36:25.951 --> 36:30.449
Well, well, it seems this trip to
Prufrock will bring me twice the fortune.

36:30.451 --> 36:33.074
And there's nobody who can stop me.

36:33.076 --> 36:36.033
Give me back my burrito, you miscreant!

36:36.035 --> 36:38.743
Larry? What...

36:45.951 --> 36:48.699
- One eyebrow.
- I bet he has a tattoo on his ankle.

36:48.701 --> 36:51.372
We have to warn the Baudelaires
something terrible is going to happen,

36:51.375 --> 36:53.116
and I don't mean a pep rally.

36:57.576 --> 37:00.408
Get moving. I'm talking
to you, cheerleaders.

37:00.410 --> 37:01.993
Get your costume on, mascot!

37:02.618 --> 37:05.324
Step lively, health
and hygiene instructor.

37:05.326 --> 37:09.660
I prefer the term
interdisciplinary gender studies.

37:15.076 --> 37:18.324
- Why won't you leave me alone?
- I'm still hungry.

37:18.326 --> 37:21.574
I gave you my burrito.
We agreed that was fair.

37:21.576 --> 37:23.201
I'm hungry for revenge.

37:23.993 --> 37:27.074
- What?
- You made me suffer long enough.

37:27.076 --> 37:28.908
The menu is chosen by
the school district.

37:28.910 --> 37:31.408
For years you've infiltrated my schemes,

37:31.410 --> 37:35.324
relying on morals and
literature to muck up my life.

37:35.326 --> 37:39.699
Well, these are your
victoriously final days.

37:39.701 --> 37:41.743
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

37:43.035 --> 37:45.991
- How did I do?
- Those last few lines were for me.

37:45.993 --> 37:48.741
- I'm so adorable when I say them.
- But theater is about context.

37:48.743 --> 37:52.949
- Let's take it from the flop.
- "Flop"? Take it from the top.

37:52.951 --> 37:55.491
Never mind. The adults are speaking.

37:55.493 --> 37:56.910
All right, fine.

37:58.993 --> 38:00.908
Working with kids, am I right?

38:00.910 --> 38:03.076
No. You're wrong about everything.

38:04.076 --> 38:06.699
Same goody-goody moral stance, I see.

38:06.701 --> 38:08.283
The only thing that's
changed is your hair.

38:08.285 --> 38:11.783
It's a hairnet, as required
by the Department of Education.

38:11.785 --> 38:14.366
In our organization, that's
called successful infiltration.

38:14.368 --> 38:17.491
I learned what that word
means, but then I forgot.

38:17.493 --> 38:21.491
All you need to remember is
that we're one step ahead of you.

38:21.493 --> 38:24.493
Strong words coming from someone
who's scrubbing a lasagna pan.

38:27.826 --> 38:29.658
Cannelloni.

38:29.660 --> 38:32.283
You wouldn't dare.
This is dry-clean only.

38:32.285 --> 38:33.408
You're in luck,

38:33.410 --> 38:36.410
because we're taking
you to the cleaners.

38:38.410 --> 38:40.533
I don't know how you got in here.

38:40.535 --> 38:41.908
A girl propped open the door.

38:41.910 --> 38:44.908
- But we're sending you back out.
- What do you mean, "we"?

38:44.910 --> 38:48.158
The pronoun for first person
plural. I'm not working alone.

38:48.160 --> 38:51.616
Oh, goodness me, you have
comrades. You have cohorts.

38:51.618 --> 38:53.685
Why didn't I think of that?

38:53.688 --> 38:56.741
- En garde!
- That's French for "We gotcha!"

38:56.743 --> 38:58.872
Do you think you can win?

38:58.875 --> 39:02.660
Totally.

39:03.868 --> 39:05.991
And do you know why?

39:05.993 --> 39:08.616
You may have the smarts and the skills.

39:08.618 --> 39:12.866
You may have the classified
codes and secret libraries.

39:12.868 --> 39:17.741
You may have the wisdom and integrity
and various poems committed to memory.

39:17.743 --> 39:20.910
- But do you know what I have?
- What?

39:23.618 --> 39:25.285
- Line.
- A jeweled...

39:26.368 --> 39:28.658
A jeweled broach!

39:28.660 --> 39:29.535
What?

39:30.160 --> 39:33.699
- Yes, a jeweled... Wait, what?
- A... That's...

39:33.701 --> 39:39.033
A plan! I have a plan! You
are not much of a spy, Barry.

39:39.035 --> 39:40.576
Larry, your waiter.

39:41.326 --> 39:44.741
You know what they say about
the food service industry.

39:44.743 --> 39:47.783
It's a cold, cold business.

39:54.243 --> 39:57.451
Now we've got to rally ourselves.

40:00.326 --> 40:02.116
- Pruf...
- Rock!

40:02.118 --> 40:07.324
Prufrock! Prufrock! Prufrock! Prufrock!

40:07.326 --> 40:09.491
- Baudelaires!
- We think you're in danger.

40:09.493 --> 40:10.408
What's wrong?

40:10.410 --> 40:13.283
The Baudelaires are in no danger at all.

40:13.285 --> 40:15.741
In fact, my wife just
dropped by the office

40:15.743 --> 40:18.616
with an advance copy of
today's Daily Punctilio,

40:18.618 --> 40:21.408
and wait till you see the headlines.

40:23.368 --> 40:25.961
- Hello?
- This is Larry, your waiter.

40:28.118 --> 40:30.408
You sound cold. Are
you in the mountains?

40:30.410 --> 40:32.616
We're not due there until
the end of the season.

40:32.618 --> 40:35.951
- Did you deliver the book?
- I had some complications.

40:36.618 --> 40:37.938
Yes.

40:37.941 --> 40:40.283
Yes. They even took my hairnet.

40:40.285 --> 40:42.533
They'll stop at nothing.
You must be freezing.

40:42.535 --> 40:45.366
Try jumping, or reciting
a Jack London story.

40:45.368 --> 40:48.449
Oh, that's a good idea.
Would you mind sending...

40:48.451 --> 40:50.785
Yes, of course. I'll call you a taxi.

41:02.993 --> 41:05.366
- Poe, are you there? Focus.
- Oh, what?

41:05.368 --> 41:08.491
No. Sorry, Mr. Tamerlane.
It was just my receptionist.

41:08.493 --> 41:11.012
You know how it is with assistants.

41:11.015 --> 41:14.013
Every so often, their phone rings
and they dive under their desks,

41:14.016 --> 41:16.951
apparently to retrieve a
pen that they've dropped.

41:18.201 --> 41:21.199
- Again.
- Snicket? Someone needs a ride, and quick.

41:21.201 --> 41:24.324
Got it. Of course. Don't make
a mountain out of a molehill.

41:24.326 --> 41:25.993
- The world...
- Is quiet here.

41:26.660 --> 41:28.241
The world is quiet here.

41:28.243 --> 41:32.783
This might sound curious, like
the motto of a secret organization,

41:32.785 --> 41:35.783
or something your brother might
say when he arrives in his taxi

41:35.785 --> 41:38.743
to smuggle you across the border,
high up into the mountains.

41:39.410 --> 41:43.533
When the world is noisy, the world
may feel as if it is coming apart.

41:46.118 --> 41:47.366
What did you see?

41:47.368 --> 41:49.533
- We think we saw Count Olaf!
- What?

41:49.535 --> 41:51.574
It's also hard to hold
a private conversation.

41:51.576 --> 41:54.324
- We think Count Olaf is here!
- What?

41:54.326 --> 41:58.493
Thank you. Thank you. Welcome
to the mandatory pep rally.

41:59.326 --> 42:02.783
I don't know which I like
more, the word "pep" or "rally."

42:02.785 --> 42:05.324
- I like "pep."
- I like "rally."

42:05.326 --> 42:07.533
Maybe we should ask our
mascot! What do you say?

42:09.493 --> 42:12.283
- What's the mascot?
- A dead horse!

42:12.285 --> 42:14.074
It sounded like you said...

42:14.076 --> 42:16.491
A dead horse. But that's not important.

42:16.493 --> 42:18.949
- Who can't be beat?
- A dead horse!

42:19.016 --> 42:21.574
- Who can't be beat?
- A dead horse!

42:21.576 --> 42:23.951
Hi-yah!

42:27.951 --> 42:28.991
You have to listen.

42:28.993 --> 42:30.366
- My brother and I saw...
- Shush!

42:30.368 --> 42:32.283
I know things seemed less peppy

42:32.285 --> 42:36.158
since our athletes, cheerleaders
and beloved gym teacher vanished

42:36.160 --> 42:37.783
on the way home from that away game.

42:37.785 --> 42:41.033
But Prufrock Preparatory
School has a motto.

42:41.035 --> 42:43.660
It's "memento mori."

42:44.493 --> 42:46.283
It's an ancient Greek saying...

42:46.285 --> 42:47.324
Latin.

42:47.326 --> 42:51.074
Which means, "Remember, you will die."

42:51.076 --> 42:54.815
And soon, indeed, the sun will
set, the fiery orb of life,

42:55.535 --> 42:58.326
leaving me alone!

42:59.535 --> 43:00.868
Alone!

43:02.368 --> 43:03.743
Alone!

43:11.910 --> 43:15.616
Until, of course, you meet
someone who truly understands

43:15.618 --> 43:18.743
and supports you with friendship,
camaraderie and cash bribes.

43:19.660 --> 43:22.035
Our gym teacher was irreplaceable,

43:22.660 --> 43:26.451
but I have found someone I
know who can fill her shoes.

43:29.701 --> 43:31.826
And now, please welcome to the stage,

43:32.660 --> 43:37.158
a man with no résumé, no
letters of recommendation,

43:37.160 --> 43:41.908
no credit history, but with
such a marvelous ear for music

43:41.910 --> 43:46.324
that I've hired him as the
newest member of our faculty!

43:46.326 --> 43:48.410
No, no, not you. No.

43:50.341 --> 43:55.883
Your new gym teacher, Coach Genghis!

43:57.993 --> 43:59.326
Count Olaf.

44:02.715 --> 44:09.490
So much to learn, and
I am here to school you.
