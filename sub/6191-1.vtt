02:18.952 --> 02:21.113
Chris! You awake?

02:24.558 --> 02:25.991
Breakfast is on the table.

02:26.026 --> 02:28.392
Come eat this shit
before it get cold.

02:28.428 --> 02:31.124
lt'd help if you
wouldn't call it shit, Pop.

02:31.164 --> 02:34.361
lt'd help if you get
your ass down and eat it.

03:09.002 --> 03:13.530
Pop, Play--Peter's having
a party, and l wanted to...

03:50.443 --> 03:53.935
Finish your breakfast, boy!

03:53.980 --> 03:56.175
Yo, man, you are wrong.

03:56.216 --> 03:57.877
We're homeboys.

03:57.918 --> 04:00.546
Why you pretending like
you don't want to D.J. the gig?

04:00.587 --> 04:02.418
l don't D.J. for free anymore.

04:02.455 --> 04:05.185
Plus, you never provide
transportation.

04:05.225 --> 04:09.628
How do l get my turntables,
records, and speakers there?

04:09.663 --> 04:12.962
Yo, man, l have the house keys
and the car keys.

04:12.999 --> 04:16.399
My parents--down south,
way down south. We're in.

04:16.435 --> 04:18.404
Let me rap,
and then we'll consider it.

04:18.438 --> 04:21.305
You already got gonged
in the school talent show.

04:21.341 --> 04:23.707
Why you want to embarrass
yourself again?

04:23.743 --> 04:26.439
l've been practicing.
l got dope lyrics.

04:26.479 --> 04:29.414
Def women l'm gonna be
hooking you up with.

04:29.449 --> 04:34.045
This ain't no tackhead party.
Def women like those.

04:34.087 --> 04:36.317
You like that?

04:36.356 --> 04:37.550
l do.

04:37.591 --> 04:39.718
Check this out. lt's Play time.

04:39.759 --> 04:41.021
Hook me up, all right?

04:42.395 --> 04:44.454
That's a weave, girl.

04:44.497 --> 04:46.431
Yo, ladies, ladies.

04:46.466 --> 04:48.730
l know y'all gonna be
in attendance...

04:48.768 --> 04:51.794
at the super-def,
throw-down jizzam of the year.

04:51.838 --> 04:54.398
Sharane, you hear anything
about a party tonight?

04:54.441 --> 04:56.875
Not any good ones.

04:56.910 --> 04:59.572
Yo, wait a minute.
Don't even try and play me.

04:59.613 --> 05:01.979
l'm not beggin'
either one of y'all.

05:02.015 --> 05:04.006
-You have before.
-You will again.

05:04.050 --> 05:07.349
Listen, you know the address.

05:07.387 --> 05:10.379
10:30, and you can
bring some friends.

05:13.860 --> 05:15.555
Hey, don't play.

05:15.595 --> 05:19.292
Since you're not into sharing,
l'll get my own.

05:19.332 --> 05:21.732
While you're over there,
give the ladies my regards.

05:21.768 --> 05:22.928
Right.

05:29.275 --> 05:31.106
Stab, l'm really sorry.

05:31.144 --> 05:33.442
l'm sorry. l'm really sorry.

05:33.480 --> 05:35.004
No, don't get up.

05:35.048 --> 05:36.276
l'll get you another milk.

05:36.316 --> 05:38.284
l'll pay for it myself.

05:38.318 --> 05:41.378
You need a milk?
l'll be right back.

05:41.421 --> 05:45.323
lf l was you,
l'd kick his fuckin' ass.

05:45.358 --> 05:47.485
Damn.

05:47.527 --> 05:49.757
You went out like a sucker.

05:49.796 --> 05:52.060
So if l throw with them,
you got my back?

05:52.098 --> 05:54.692
Of course. You know that.

05:54.734 --> 05:58.067
l'm your man.
You know l'm gonna take--

06:00.106 --> 06:02.870
-Hi, Kid.
-Hi.

06:02.909 --> 06:07.346
You finished?
We were about to sit with you.

06:07.380 --> 06:10.975
l was gonna sit a little longer,
so you should.

06:11.017 --> 06:13.645
Are you really not coming
to the party tonight?

06:13.687 --> 06:16.087
Why? Should we?

06:16.122 --> 06:17.282
lt's up to you.

06:17.323 --> 06:19.655
lf you weren't going,
l'd probably skip it, too.

06:19.693 --> 06:21.490
l think you should go.

06:21.528 --> 06:24.929
-We'll probably see you there.
-Maybe.

06:24.964 --> 06:26.864
You should be nice to him.

06:26.900 --> 06:29.835
You started it.
"Why? Should we?"

06:29.869 --> 06:31.029
Shut up.

06:38.078 --> 06:40.512
Anyway, l was over there, right?

06:40.547 --> 06:43.345
That's twice.

06:46.186 --> 06:49.519
You conscious motherfucker.

06:49.556 --> 06:53.083
You got a sleepwalking problem,
we can fix it.

06:53.126 --> 06:56.186
We'll break your legs
and kick your fucking ass!

06:56.229 --> 06:59.392
l'll break my leg off
up in your ass so far...

06:59.432 --> 07:01.593
you'll shit sneaker for a month.

07:01.634 --> 07:04.228
-l've done it before.
-He'll do it again.

07:04.270 --> 07:06.864
Why you sweating me, man?

07:06.906 --> 07:08.703
You're wrinkling
my school clothes.

07:08.742 --> 07:10.334
"You're wrinkling
my school clothes."

07:12.345 --> 07:13.972
Yo, wait, wait.

07:14.013 --> 07:17.312
What's the problem?
Your mama can't afford no iron?

07:17.350 --> 07:19.614
Tell her to come on over
to Stab.

07:19.652 --> 07:22.280
l'll put her on the stroll.
She can save up, get one.

07:23.323 --> 07:24.756
He can't fuck with you.

07:24.791 --> 07:27.089
Watch out, man! Watch it!

07:28.361 --> 07:32.161
This punk motherfucker
throwing shit at us.

07:32.198 --> 07:34.393
l smell something, man.

07:34.434 --> 07:36.561
l definitely smell something.

07:36.603 --> 07:39.572
l smell pussy!

07:39.606 --> 07:41.836
-He's a pussy, man!
-Kick his ass!

07:45.979 --> 07:47.640
How you like that, boy?

07:47.680 --> 07:49.147
Do it, do it!

07:51.785 --> 07:53.082
Go, go, go!

07:55.889 --> 07:57.948
Wait, wait. OK, now!

08:00.059 --> 08:01.993
OK, fellas!

08:06.266 --> 08:08.257
What you got to say now, punk?

08:08.301 --> 08:11.134
Your Shaolin technique
is very good.

08:11.171 --> 08:14.299
He thinks we're joking--

08:17.510 --> 08:20.411
Homeboy, you all right, man?
lt's over?

08:20.446 --> 08:21.777
Kid, we had your back.

08:21.815 --> 08:24.648
Yeah, way back.

08:24.684 --> 08:25.844
Damn.

08:27.220 --> 08:30.986
l'm sorry l almost hit
Mr. Wilson with the Jell-O...

08:31.024 --> 08:34.482
but Stab called my mother a ho.

08:34.527 --> 08:36.688
You see, my mother's dead.

08:36.729 --> 08:39.960
l'm very sorry about
your mother, Christopher...

08:39.999 --> 08:43.696
but you can't fight because you
have a chip on your shoulder.

08:43.736 --> 08:47.797
You're a good student,
so go back to class.

08:47.841 --> 08:50.605
But your father
will have to be notified.

08:52.679 --> 08:54.146
As for you, young man...

08:54.180 --> 08:57.377
l'm tired of seeing you
in this office.

08:57.417 --> 08:59.578
Could you tell me
why in God's name...

08:59.619 --> 09:01.644
you called his mother
a garden tool?

09:06.526 --> 09:08.289
How mad could he be?

09:09.462 --> 09:11.794
Maybe the school
didn't even call him.

09:53.406 --> 09:55.533
l'm so glad you're home.

09:55.575 --> 09:57.941
Sit down. l need to talk to you.

09:59.078 --> 10:01.410
What's up, Pop?

10:01.447 --> 10:04.143
l'm making some Dick Gregory.
You want some?

10:04.183 --> 10:06.208
No, thanks, Pop.

10:06.252 --> 10:08.686
You know l need this stuff, boy.

10:08.721 --> 10:11.315
l got a weight problem.
Can't wait to eat.

10:11.357 --> 10:15.453
Pop, are these the only...

10:15.495 --> 10:18.123
pieces of mail you got today?

10:18.164 --> 10:20.826
Just some bills.
You want to pay them?

10:25.038 --> 10:26.437
What?

10:28.942 --> 10:31.467
Bila? Bilyle?

10:31.511 --> 10:34.344
Whatever your name is,
what you want?

10:34.380 --> 10:35.677
lt's for you.

10:35.715 --> 10:37.444
l'll take it upstairs.

10:39.419 --> 10:43.219
Why they name that boy
that African name?

10:43.256 --> 10:44.746
They from Cleveland.

10:47.627 --> 10:48.753
Yo, what's up?

10:48.795 --> 10:50.922
Kid, have you talked to Play?

10:50.964 --> 10:53.831
l been calling his house.
Nobody answers.

10:53.866 --> 10:55.993
He was supposed
to come pick me up.

10:56.035 --> 10:57.593
l haven't spoke to him.

10:57.637 --> 10:59.901
l'm really sweating
this pink slip from school.

10:59.939 --> 11:02.066
lf Pops finds out l got
in trouble in school today...

11:02.108 --> 11:03.837
l'm definitely gonna be
on punishment.

11:03.876 --> 11:05.867
You're still
worrying about that?

11:05.912 --> 11:08.506
lf you ain't got a letter yet...

11:08.548 --> 11:10.948
then they'll call
your house after 5:00.

11:10.984 --> 11:13.384
That's when they expect
your parents to be home.

11:13.419 --> 11:15.683
Shit. What do l do?

11:15.722 --> 11:19.385
Just leave and don't come back
till after the party.

11:19.425 --> 11:21.325
l still got to get dressed.

11:21.361 --> 11:23.329
l can't come
to the set stinking.

11:23.363 --> 11:26.059
Throw some Brut on
and meet me at the party.

11:26.099 --> 11:29.762
Chris, get off the phone
and come down here.

11:29.802 --> 11:31.793
l got to jet.
l'll see you tonight.

11:31.838 --> 11:33.237
All right, man. Peace.

11:36.476 --> 11:39.639
Don't tie up the telephone
talking to your friends.

11:39.679 --> 11:42.113
l'm expecting a call
for some overtime.

11:42.148 --> 11:43.581
OK, Pop.

11:43.616 --> 11:46.881
There's a party
at Play--Peter's house.

11:46.919 --> 11:49.319
-Can l go?
-On a school night?

11:49.355 --> 11:52.017
l'll make sure l'm back
before curfew.

11:52.058 --> 11:55.152
Oh, man.
l had plans for us tonight.

11:55.194 --> 11:58.027
l rented a couple of videos.
"Dolemite."

11:58.064 --> 12:01.864
You like "Dolemite."
You grew up on it.

12:03.703 --> 12:06.831
All right.
lf you got to, you got to.

12:06.873 --> 12:09.842
But after you finish
your homework.

12:09.876 --> 12:11.741
No problem, Pop.

12:11.778 --> 12:15.077
What's wrong with you?
Don't like "Dolemite"?

12:15.114 --> 12:17.708
"Way down in the jungle deep...

12:17.750 --> 12:21.277
"bad-ass lion stepped on
the signifyin' monkey's feet."

12:51.784 --> 12:53.809
Toe to toe,
Kid 'n Play is on a roll again

12:53.853 --> 12:56.583
lt's only right that we
keep the crowd dancin'

12:56.622 --> 12:58.852
Rhymes are dope,
the tempo is steady

12:58.891 --> 13:01.223
You ready? Let's rip up
the floor like confetti

13:01.260 --> 13:04.525
Y'all, l got a great
new album in the mail today.

13:04.564 --> 13:07.931
Onyx Communications
and Hey Love Productions...

13:07.967 --> 13:09.832
proudly present "Hey Love."

13:09.869 --> 13:12.838
All the commercials
they showin' nowadays.

13:12.872 --> 13:17.036
God. Every TV station.

13:18.544 --> 13:22.503
Cut the television off,
comin' through the damn walls.

13:22.548 --> 13:26.450
The incomparable Delfonics
and much, much more.

13:26.486 --> 13:29.011
l got to get this fan fixed.

13:29.055 --> 13:30.989
lt was so hot in here
last night...

13:31.023 --> 13:34.117
l saw the devil
sittin' in the living room.

13:35.394 --> 13:38.852
Shit. Niggers ain't gonna
break my mama's good stuff.

13:40.099 --> 13:41.657
Let 'em fuck with this plastic.

13:53.679 --> 13:56.307
What up?
Play Martin in the place to be.

13:56.349 --> 13:58.647
The place to be
is my house an hour ago.

13:58.684 --> 14:01.244
lf you want a D.J.,
stop smokin' that crack...

14:01.287 --> 14:04.381
and drive your mother's
raggedy-ass Chevy over here!

14:04.423 --> 14:07.551
Chill, man.
l'll jet over in one minute.

14:07.593 --> 14:08.958
l don't like fooling
with you, man.

14:08.995 --> 14:11.862
Come on now, Play!

14:11.898 --> 14:13.388
All right!

14:15.468 --> 14:16.628
l love you.

14:23.342 --> 14:25.139
Kid, answer the door!

14:34.620 --> 14:38.249
Answer the door.
l'll get the phone.

14:45.097 --> 14:47.588
Yeah, what's up?

14:47.633 --> 14:51.729
l sure was depending on
that overtime.

14:56.776 --> 15:00.109
Give me that letter.
Are you retarded?

15:00.146 --> 15:02.239
No, l wasn't talking to you.

15:02.281 --> 15:04.340
Crazy mophead boy of mine.

15:04.383 --> 15:07.045
Ready to cut his hair off.

15:07.086 --> 15:11.455
Look like a young tree stump
walkin' around here.

15:11.490 --> 15:14.459
What's old James up to?

15:19.599 --> 15:22.193
Let me call you back later.

15:22.235 --> 15:24.226
l got somethin' to take care of.

15:28.241 --> 15:30.869
Can you explain this?

15:30.910 --> 15:33.401
He called Mom out a name.

15:33.446 --> 15:36.142
Don't you think
it's been long enough?

15:36.182 --> 15:40.175
l am sick of you using
your mother for an excuse.

15:40.219 --> 15:42.449
l wasn't using her as an excuse.

15:42.488 --> 15:44.752
Then why didn't you tell me
when you got home?

15:44.790 --> 15:47.258
Why you try to hide it?

15:47.293 --> 15:48.453
l didn't think it was important.

15:48.494 --> 15:51.486
No? Your school thought
it was important.

15:51.530 --> 15:55.125
You'll spend tonight thinking
about your priorities...

15:55.167 --> 15:58.000
after you finish
your damn homework.

15:58.037 --> 15:59.902
You said
l could go to the party.

15:59.939 --> 16:02.931
Them hoods you fought with
will be there...

16:02.975 --> 16:05.239
and you don't need
no more trouble.

16:05.278 --> 16:07.508
lt's not that type of crowd.

16:07.546 --> 16:09.013
All my friends will be there.

16:09.048 --> 16:12.677
l don't care if Marvin Gaye
will be there. You won't!

16:12.718 --> 16:15.278
You don't know
how to act no way.

16:15.321 --> 16:19.052
Last time, you didn't come in
till l went to work.

16:19.091 --> 16:22.652
lf you let me go this time,
l'll be back before curfew.

16:22.695 --> 16:26.358
lt'd be different
if Peter's parents were there.

16:26.399 --> 16:28.264
l wouldn't mind you going.

16:28.301 --> 16:32.169
But they ain't.
They work nights just like l do.

16:32.204 --> 16:35.264
Matter of fact,
them folks is out of town.

16:35.308 --> 16:37.173
You kids think you slick,
don't you?

16:37.209 --> 16:40.440
Every little step you take
will be around this bedroom.

16:40.479 --> 16:42.709
Believe it.
You're not goin' nowhere.

16:42.748 --> 16:45.683
You're gonna make me
a social misfit.

16:45.718 --> 16:48.312
l'm tryin' to make you
a responsible person.

16:48.354 --> 16:50.618
But l am responsible.

16:50.656 --> 16:52.886
Listen, get your act together.

16:52.925 --> 16:55.758
Keep your mind on them books
and off them gals.

16:55.795 --> 16:59.629
'Cause you will make
the same mistake l did.

17:03.602 --> 17:07.971
Look, l'm sorry.

17:08.007 --> 17:09.872
l'm sorry.
l shouldn't have said that.

17:09.909 --> 17:11.740
l'm sorry.

17:13.746 --> 17:17.704
l'm under a lot of pressure.
l'm sorry.

17:17.750 --> 17:20.013
But you ain't goin'
to that damn party.

17:20.051 --> 17:22.145
l don't give a damn
what you say.

17:25.491 --> 17:27.356
That's why l hate messin'
with them.

18:01.494 --> 18:04.486
We got to get going.
No time to waste.

18:04.530 --> 18:07.795
Who's that in the car, Play?

18:07.833 --> 18:10.199
That's a honey.
l know what you're thinking.

18:10.236 --> 18:13.137
That ain't for you,
but there'll be a lot more.

18:13.172 --> 18:15.470
We can't fit
a lot of equipment...

18:15.508 --> 18:17.738
and three people
in that little-ass car!

18:17.777 --> 18:21.577
You don't know how
to load things scientifically.

18:21.614 --> 18:25.050
Leave it!
You're tearing my shit!

18:26.952 --> 18:28.214
Don't!

18:28.254 --> 18:30.654
Shit! What the--

18:33.092 --> 18:35.083
Just leave it alone! Don't!

18:35.127 --> 18:36.424
Play, leave it alone!

18:36.462 --> 18:38.794
Just leave it! l'll do it!

18:38.831 --> 18:39.923
Leave it alone!

18:39.965 --> 18:43.332
Hey, l'm--Hey!

18:43.369 --> 18:46.770
There it is. We got it.

18:46.806 --> 18:48.740
Where am l supposed to sit?

18:48.774 --> 18:51.538
Get out! She's gonna walk!

18:51.577 --> 18:52.601
She's gonna walk!

18:52.645 --> 18:54.943
Of course you can fit.
Try the other side.

18:54.980 --> 18:56.447
You can get in right over--

18:57.950 --> 18:59.247
Excuse me one minute.

18:59.285 --> 19:00.411
Yes, baby?

19:00.453 --> 19:02.182
l don't even appreciate
how you treatin' me.

19:02.221 --> 19:03.347
l'm real sorry, baby.

19:03.389 --> 19:05.755
l do appreciate
the way you look.

19:07.460 --> 19:10.691
No. Don't touch me!

19:10.729 --> 19:13.163
l'll tell you what.

19:13.199 --> 19:16.225
l'll run this over to my crib
and be right back.

19:16.268 --> 19:18.429
Be right back? Kiss my ass!

19:18.471 --> 19:20.268
You gonna take
my equipment and leave me?

19:20.306 --> 19:22.433
No! l ain't goin' for it!

19:22.475 --> 19:23.806
What else can l do?

19:23.843 --> 19:26.812
Kick that bitch to the curb
and let me ride.

19:26.846 --> 19:27.870
l'm the D.J., man.

19:27.913 --> 19:31.144
Who you callin' a bitch?
Your mama's a bitch.

19:31.183 --> 19:34.346
-My mama ain't no bitch.
-lf l am, she is.

19:34.386 --> 19:36.911
l'll kick your ass!
l'll fight a girl!

19:36.956 --> 19:39.481
l know.

19:39.525 --> 19:41.254
l can't. lt would be cold.

19:41.293 --> 19:43.989
Besides,
she's packed in real good.

19:44.029 --> 19:46.293
Look, no.

19:46.332 --> 19:49.893
You know what, man?
l fucked up today.

19:49.935 --> 19:53.530
l owe you one,
and l'll be right back for you.

19:53.572 --> 19:55.904
-No, you ain't.
-He's got nerve.

19:55.941 --> 19:57.704
l'll kick both of your asses.

19:57.743 --> 20:02.339
Play, don't play.
Don't do that!

20:02.381 --> 20:04.474
Don't drive off!

20:04.517 --> 20:08.009
l'll say it calmly.
Maybe l was hollering.

20:08.053 --> 20:09.782
Play, don't play.

20:09.822 --> 20:11.119
l love you!

20:11.156 --> 20:13.147
Play! Damn!

20:20.900 --> 20:23.232
Hold on, man.
Somebody's at the door.

20:26.672 --> 20:28.697
lt's Sidney.

20:28.741 --> 20:30.709
Yeah, she's a trip.

20:30.743 --> 20:34.179
You know who she is.
You like her.

20:36.882 --> 20:39.248
Go ahead and wait
in the living room...

20:39.285 --> 20:40.616
with your big nose.

20:42.354 --> 20:45.482
Punk. Hi, everybody.

20:45.524 --> 20:49.221
No, man, l said 12:00.
l didn't say 8:00.

20:49.261 --> 20:51.957
l ain't going
to no party at 8:00.

20:51.997 --> 20:55.228
-Sharane!
-l'm coming!

20:55.267 --> 20:57.064
There'll be
fine women at the party.

20:57.102 --> 20:58.194
Why bring a girl with you?

20:58.237 --> 21:01.798
The incomparable Delfonics
and much, much more.

21:01.840 --> 21:05.936
This is a fantastic album.
Let me borrow it.

21:05.978 --> 21:08.913
No, my brother.
You've got to buy your own.

21:08.948 --> 21:10.939
Come on, girl.

21:10.983 --> 21:13.144
l said l was coming.
You always rushin'.

21:13.185 --> 21:15.278
Whazzup?

21:15.321 --> 21:18.916
My nails are wet.
Let's go outside while they dry.

21:18.958 --> 21:22.553
Leave her at home, man.
She's ugly.

21:22.595 --> 21:24.529
l can't wait to do that dance.

21:24.563 --> 21:26.292
You know the one we been doin'?

21:26.332 --> 21:27.890
Wait, l'm comin' back out.

21:27.933 --> 21:29.093
You move, you lose.

21:29.134 --> 21:32.103
-Come on, Sharane.
-Bye.

21:33.739 --> 21:36.435
She gets on my nerves.

21:36.475 --> 21:38.443
l don't know
if l like my outfit.

21:38.477 --> 21:40.206
Why? You matchin'.

21:40.245 --> 21:42.110
l think l match too much.

21:42.147 --> 21:47.380
l told you about them
Garanimal outfits from K-Mart.

21:47.419 --> 21:49.887
Why you tryin' to dis me?

21:49.922 --> 21:51.412
Want some Kool-Aid?

21:51.457 --> 21:53.721
Peanut, bring us
two glasses of Kool-Aid.

21:55.894 --> 21:57.953
You know l'll ask you
to borrow that tomorrow.

21:57.997 --> 22:00.022
-There ain't no more.
-Make some.

22:00.065 --> 22:01.623
l won't give it to you.

22:01.667 --> 22:03.294
-Sharane!
-What?

22:03.335 --> 22:06.065
-Grape or red?
-Red.

22:06.105 --> 22:09.074
Peanut, fix me
some of that Dick Gregory.

22:10.309 --> 22:11.674
Who's supposed to be there?

22:11.710 --> 22:13.337
Play...

22:15.014 --> 22:16.709
Dragon-breath Bilal.

22:16.749 --> 22:19.775
And your man, Kid.

22:19.818 --> 22:22.286
You go, girl. Yours.

22:22.321 --> 22:25.188
Don't even try it!
That is your man!

22:25.224 --> 22:27.158
l don't know why
you keep sweatin' him.

22:27.192 --> 22:29.456
He got a cute thing happenin'.

22:29.495 --> 22:31.122
He's just so young-actin'.

22:31.163 --> 22:33.358
He needs to chill from hangin'
with his crew and grow up...

22:33.399 --> 22:35.367
then maybe l'll give him some.

22:35.401 --> 22:37.096
You ain't givin' nobody nothin'.

22:37.136 --> 22:39.627
-Don't even try it!
-Watch.

22:39.672 --> 22:42.106
And l'm gonna give you
details blow by blow.

22:42.141 --> 22:43.301
l'm gonna get my coat.

22:43.342 --> 22:46.311
OK. Bye, everybody.

22:46.345 --> 22:47.505
Bye, Grandma.

22:50.749 --> 22:52.808
You drink that, Peanut.
We out of here.

22:52.851 --> 22:54.113
Look at all that sugar.

22:54.153 --> 22:56.678
Just thinkin' about that stuff
makes my teeth hurt.

22:56.722 --> 22:58.986
That's good, girl.
What you talkin' about?

23:03.362 --> 23:07.230
Way down in the jungle deep...

23:09.601 --> 23:12.798
the lion stepped on
the signifyin' monkey's feet.

23:15.374 --> 23:18.775
The monkey said,
"Motherfucker, can't you see?"

23:21.547 --> 23:25.677
"You're standin'
on my goddamn feet."

24:04.823 --> 24:06.950
B-love, yo, bust it!

24:06.992 --> 24:09.085
What's up, cuz?

24:09.128 --> 24:12.120

but l came back as promised.

24:12.164 --> 24:13.995
l ain't goin'.

24:14.032 --> 24:15.465
What do you mean
you ain't goin'?

24:15.501 --> 24:17.059
Read my lips.

24:17.102 --> 24:20.299
l've been waiting an hour
to tell you l'm not going.

24:20.339 --> 24:22.068
You're just a little upset--

24:22.107 --> 24:24.302
This is why
l don't D.J. for free.

24:24.343 --> 24:26.743
'Cause niggers
don't be appreciating shit.

24:26.779 --> 24:30.044
-l don't appreciate nothin'?
-No, you don't.

24:30.082 --> 24:33.483
Man, take a look in that car.

24:33.519 --> 24:37.114
There's too many for me
to handle.

24:37.156 --> 24:38.987
They all goin' to the party...

24:39.024 --> 24:42.516
and all they asked was,
"Who's the D.J.?"

24:42.561 --> 24:44.461
So l brought them over...

24:44.496 --> 24:46.657
so you could jump-start
before the other brothers.

24:46.698 --> 24:48.666
ls that supposed to convince me?

24:50.335 --> 24:53.429
Ladies, B-love's in the house.

24:53.472 --> 24:55.531
Dragon-breath.

24:55.574 --> 24:56.973
Who you talkin' to?

25:03.949 --> 25:08.386
Look at this hair.
Eraserhead!

25:08.420 --> 25:10.445
Where you going?

25:10.489 --> 25:11.751
Why do you want to know?

25:11.790 --> 25:14.884
We'll ask the questions,

25:14.927 --> 25:16.019
Yes, sir.

25:16.061 --> 25:19.519
Want to check him for lD?

25:19.565 --> 25:20.827
We're out of doughnuts.

25:20.866 --> 25:24.700
What? Jesus, let's go.

25:24.736 --> 25:28.672
You watch yourself, understand?
'Cause we are.

25:35.848 --> 25:37.748
Thank you, Cagney and Lacey.

25:43.188 --> 25:45.418

26:20.459 --> 26:21.653
Whose pussy, baby?

26:21.693 --> 26:22.853

26:22.895 --> 26:25.693
You fine motherfucker!
Oh, shit.

26:25.731 --> 26:27.323
You fine motherfucker, you.

26:27.366 --> 26:29.231

26:57.296 --> 26:59.025
Stay away from

27:00.866 --> 27:01.992
Fuckin' peep-freaks.

27:13.745 --> 27:15.940
Yo, wasn't that Kid?

27:15.981 --> 27:18.643
Was it?

27:18.684 --> 27:20.276
Ain't no room in here anyway.

27:20.319 --> 27:24.255
That's cold. Hi.

27:25.290 --> 27:27.190
Aw, man.

27:29.127 --> 27:30.116
Oh, shit!

27:40.505 --> 27:43.440
Here's another dusty one
for you dusties.

27:45.243 --> 27:47.575
Hope you all got
your Medicaid together.

27:50.615 --> 27:51.741
Who's that?

27:51.783 --> 27:54.479
Hey, Pops.
What they got you doing?

27:54.519 --> 27:56.180
What's to it, man?

27:56.221 --> 27:57.950
Playin' for
the elephant graveyard, man.

27:57.990 --> 27:59.958
Dead tired. lt's a gig, man.

27:59.992 --> 28:02.187
What you got

28:02.227 --> 28:03.990
Some Platters, lnk Spots...

28:04.029 --> 28:06.930
Mills Brothers, Count Basie,
Big Joe Turner.

28:06.965 --> 28:10.298
Slap some of them old sides
on the turntable...

28:10.335 --> 28:12.633
get a little scratchin'
and mixin' goin' on...

28:12.671 --> 28:14.696
l'll grab the microphone,
and we can get busy.

28:14.740 --> 28:15.866
Do that again.

28:15.907 --> 28:17.135
You just grab...

28:32.724 --> 28:33.850
Let's kick his--

28:33.892 --> 28:36.326
Chill. The punk is mine.

28:36.361 --> 28:37.419
Kick it, Pops!

28:43.702 --> 28:46.000
One, two. One, two.

28:46.038 --> 28:48.666
Hey, everybody,
my name is Kid.

28:48.707 --> 28:50.402
How y'all feelin'?

28:50.442 --> 28:53.036
Just throw your hands
in the air.

28:53.078 --> 28:56.775
Just wave your hands in the air!
Come on!

28:56.815 --> 28:59.147
Wave your hands in the air!
That's right.

29:02.054 --> 29:04.488
Throw your hands
in the air, all right?

29:04.523 --> 29:06.115
Wave your hands in the air.

29:06.158 --> 29:07.955
Throw, throw...

29:12.597 --> 29:13.564
Oh, dear!

29:13.598 --> 29:14.895
Get the hell back there!

29:17.235 --> 29:20.033
You want to see how crazy l am?

29:20.072 --> 29:21.767
What you lookin' at?

29:21.807 --> 29:23.775
Yo, Mandingo,
leave the brother alone.

29:23.809 --> 29:27.210
Sucker, you want
another part in your head?

29:27.245 --> 29:30.009
Lighten up.

29:30.048 --> 29:31.538
Yeah, l did it.

29:31.583 --> 29:33.813
l might cry two tears
in a bucket. Fuck it.

29:33.852 --> 29:35.046
Let's take it to the stage.

29:46.231 --> 29:47.960
Sorry, sir.

30:06.651 --> 30:08.243
Look, Officer,
it was just an accident.

30:08.286 --> 30:10.186
We don't want to press charges.

30:10.222 --> 30:12.588
They've been in
a few accidents this evening.

30:12.624 --> 30:14.148
l don't think you should
let this slide by.

30:14.192 --> 30:16.990
They need discipline,
not solitary confinement.

30:17.028 --> 30:19.428
That's true.

30:19.464 --> 30:20.795
Thank you very much.

30:24.503 --> 30:26.835
Too scared to make a statement.

30:26.872 --> 30:29.102
-They're not gonna talk?
-Nope.

30:29.141 --> 30:31.041
They're not gonna press charges?

30:36.014 --> 30:38.710
You perpetrators
were very lucky tonight.

30:38.750 --> 30:41.184
Apparently these people
aren't gonna press charges.

30:41.219 --> 30:47.351
So you're gonna get up,
go home, and go to bed.

30:47.392 --> 30:48.757
But before you do...

30:50.862 --> 30:52.989
l want you to repeat after me.

30:53.031 --> 30:54.225
What?

30:54.266 --> 30:55.233
l am...

30:55.267 --> 30:56.791
What?

30:58.370 --> 30:59.337
l am !

30:59.371 --> 31:00.395
Come on, with feeling.

31:00.438 --> 31:02.167
l am...

31:02.207 --> 31:03.572
somebody.

31:03.608 --> 31:05.132
somebody.

31:05.177 --> 31:07.111
Oh, really.

31:07.145 --> 31:08.339
This is ridiculous.

31:08.380 --> 31:12.680
That's good.
Now get up and go home.

31:12.717 --> 31:15.584
Beat it! Hold it!

31:15.620 --> 31:19.147
Let him go. You go that way.

31:19.191 --> 31:20.351
Shit!

31:46.785 --> 31:48.047
The place to be.

31:48.086 --> 31:50.350
-Got some gum, man?
-No.

31:50.388 --> 31:51.514
Groove!

31:51.556 --> 31:52.682
What's up, Play?

31:52.724 --> 31:54.521
Chill! Herman, man.

31:54.559 --> 31:57.426
Make yourself at home.

31:57.462 --> 31:59.453
Too many hard-legs here.
Need more women.

32:08.473 --> 32:11.499
LaDonna! How you doin', baby?

32:11.543 --> 32:13.568
Lookin' real good.

32:13.612 --> 32:15.273
How about giving me
those digits?

32:16.781 --> 32:17.941
Step off.

32:23.455 --> 32:27.551
Baby, l'm taking you places,
meetin' people.

32:28.927 --> 32:31.157
-Clinton, homes.
-What's up, money?

32:31.196 --> 32:32.754
Glad you could make it.

32:32.797 --> 32:35.994
l want you
to meet my lady, um...

32:36.034 --> 32:37.160
Benita.

32:37.202 --> 32:39.670
lt's a pleasure to meet you.

32:39.704 --> 32:42.366
l hope l have the opportunity
of dancing with you later.

32:42.407 --> 32:43.897
We'll see about that.

32:50.982 --> 32:52.108
LaShay, how you doin'?

32:52.150 --> 32:53.879
Don't you have any refreshments?

32:53.918 --> 32:56.045
Some soda or potato chips?

32:56.087 --> 32:58.555
You should've got here earlier.
l had everything.

32:58.590 --> 33:00.421
Liter bottles, potato chips,
the whole shebang.

33:00.458 --> 33:02.153
Brothers went through it.

33:02.193 --> 33:05.526
l always get here
too late for the snacks.

33:05.563 --> 33:07.588
There's a store
right up the street.

33:07.632 --> 33:09.600
Anything you want.
Help yourself.

33:09.634 --> 33:12.603
Mama should have fed you
before you got here.

33:12.637 --> 33:14.195
This ain't no soup kitchen.

33:19.077 --> 33:20.567
Yo, what's up, man?

33:20.612 --> 33:21.943
What's up?

33:21.980 --> 33:24.881
Glad you showed up.
What's with your pops?

33:24.916 --> 33:27.612
How much more trouble
can l get into?

33:27.652 --> 33:29.142
A beat-down's a beat-down.

33:29.187 --> 33:31.451
Let me announce you.

33:31.489 --> 33:33.457
Y'all, look who fell
into the gig!

33:33.491 --> 33:34.890
l got to go.
Make yourself at home.

33:34.926 --> 33:36.655
Put my stuff in its spot.

33:36.695 --> 33:37.889
You got it.

33:44.235 --> 33:45.532
What's up?

33:55.413 --> 33:56.744
What up?

33:56.781 --> 33:58.112
What up, B? How you livin'?

33:58.149 --> 33:59.411
Coolin'.

33:59.451 --> 34:01.385
Cover the labels.
Niggers can't bite your shit.

34:01.419 --> 34:03.683
That's smooth.
You brought the mike?

34:03.722 --> 34:08.318
Yeah, but look, man,
it's for Play.

34:08.360 --> 34:10.920
lt's his party.
Only he can rap.

34:10.962 --> 34:13.760
That mumble-mouth motherfucker?

34:13.797 --> 34:15.766
l'm the one
with the dope lyrics.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.460
l got to go
for mine tonight.

34:17.502 --> 34:20.335
Fuck that.
Get my lyrics together.

34:21.339 --> 34:23.239
Man.

34:25.076 --> 34:27.203
Work, Sharane!

34:28.246 --> 34:29.975
Where you at?

34:34.319 --> 34:35.478
Go, girl!

35:18.062 --> 35:22.829
Chill, don't bump the table.
l appreciate it.

35:22.867 --> 35:25.563
Play something l can dance to,
and l won't.

35:37.782 --> 35:40.342
Don't bump the table.
l'm tryin' to mix.

35:40.385 --> 35:43.013
You call that mixin'?
l just helped you out.

35:43.054 --> 35:44.385
Thank you!

35:46.925 --> 35:49.416
Next time l'm just
gonna fuck him up.

35:51.629 --> 35:53.119
What the...

35:58.636 --> 36:01.901
What the hell's going on here?

36:03.475 --> 36:06.501
Shut up all that damn noise!
This ain't "Soul Train"!

36:06.544 --> 36:07.943
Where's Don Cornelius
with his stiff neck?

36:07.979 --> 36:10.277
You shut up all that damn noise.

36:10.315 --> 36:12.340
l paid $15,000 for this house.

36:12.383 --> 36:14.317
Who else is over there,
Public Enema?

36:14.352 --> 36:15.979
What's his name?

36:16.020 --> 36:18.716
What the hell
is a public enema anyway?

36:18.756 --> 36:19.882
Walter.

36:19.924 --> 36:22.552
Brother, you by yourself.
What's wrong?

36:22.594 --> 36:24.585
Maybe that
big water head you got.

36:24.629 --> 36:27.689
Shut up all this damn noise!

36:27.732 --> 36:29.199
Hey, baby.

36:29.234 --> 36:31.293
You have got some nice ones.

36:32.237 --> 36:34.933
Baby, shut up.
l'm just playing with the kids.

36:34.973 --> 36:37.464
You should find out
what she eatin'.

36:37.509 --> 36:39.841
Y'all shut the hell up
down there!

36:39.878 --> 36:42.005
l got something for you.

36:42.046 --> 36:44.514
You stay right there.
Ain't this a bitch?

36:48.553 --> 36:50.043
What are you doing?

36:50.088 --> 36:54.024
-Callin' the police.
-For what?

36:54.058 --> 36:57.186
They're driving me crazy
with this damn noise.

36:57.228 --> 37:00.197
You makin' all the noise.

37:00.231 --> 37:02.131
l got the wrong number,
too, baby.

37:02.166 --> 37:03.463
Hold on one second.

37:03.501 --> 37:07.164
Dance now with your big ass.

37:08.172 --> 37:10.606
911?

37:10.642 --> 37:13.167
l'll hold.

37:18.883 --> 37:21.613
Scandalous!

37:25.723 --> 37:28.453
Sharane, man.
That girl is Nubian.

37:28.493 --> 37:31.223
She's the finest girl in here.

37:31.262 --> 37:33.822
That ain't hard in here,
but still...

37:33.865 --> 37:37.596
l'm getting those digits.

37:37.635 --> 37:40.035
Don't play yourself.
You ain't got no rap.

37:40.071 --> 37:41.902
She don't know that.

37:43.775 --> 37:45.868
Sweet daddy!

37:49.914 --> 37:52.007
Why you cock-blockin' me?

37:52.050 --> 37:54.075
lt ain't like that.
We go way back.

37:54.118 --> 37:55.779
l used to go with her
in third grade.

37:55.820 --> 37:59.654
-l don't remember that.
-For three days.

37:59.691 --> 38:01.522
Why you trippin'?

38:01.559 --> 38:03.959
Just make sure we don't trip
on the dance floor.

38:33.625 --> 38:37.322
Why these cops
keep sweatin' us, man?

38:37.362 --> 38:40.854
They always fuckin' with us.

38:44.802 --> 38:47.168
They're gone, man.

38:48.406 --> 38:49.532
Damn.

38:49.574 --> 38:50.734
Look at us, fellas.

38:50.775 --> 38:53.869
This is not right.
We're nervous and tense.

38:53.911 --> 38:56.778
Cop cars follow us,
and we just go to pieces.

38:56.814 --> 38:58.975
-This ain't us!
-This ain't the way.

38:59.017 --> 39:00.882
l know there's a reason
behind all this.

39:00.918 --> 39:02.579
And l know what the reason is.

39:02.620 --> 39:05.214
All because of some faggot,
head-like-a-rocket...

39:05.256 --> 39:08.487
stick-your-finger-in-a-socket,
punk motherfucker named Kid.

39:08.526 --> 39:09.925
That's who l mean!

39:09.961 --> 39:12.794
Ever since this fool
came into my life...

39:12.830 --> 39:14.957
l can't do nothin'
but see him, man.

39:14.999 --> 39:17.263
l'll be alone with
my woman sometimes...

39:17.301 --> 39:19.701
damn near ready
to wax that ass...

39:19.737 --> 39:21.967
and all l can do
is vision this fool.

39:23.508 --> 39:25.032
-Word?
-Word.

39:25.076 --> 39:26.407
l don't know about that.

39:26.444 --> 39:30.778
l know when it comes
to my dick action...

39:30.815 --> 39:33.682
all l can think about
is the pussy.

39:33.718 --> 39:36.687
He must have a mental block
or something.

39:36.721 --> 39:38.746
Pee-Wee, you know what l mean.

39:38.790 --> 39:41.953
-l was jokin'.
-l'll drop you like a bad cold.

39:41.993 --> 39:44.154
Why don't you chill
the fuck out?

39:44.195 --> 39:47.130
l'm gonna put a serious
bum-rush into effect...

39:47.165 --> 39:49.133
and we in the house.

39:49.167 --> 39:53.069
l get it.
We'll be housin' the party.

39:53.104 --> 39:55.664
We'll make it
like a real house party.

39:55.707 --> 39:58.699
-We be housin' shit.
-Word.

39:58.743 --> 40:01.337
Officer,
l spent $15,000 on my house.

40:01.379 --> 40:04.177
l don't want no goddamn
Public Enema around here.

40:04.215 --> 40:06.775
Yes, sir.

40:06.818 --> 40:08.251
Shut up, old man!

40:08.286 --> 40:11.119
Your asses are old.
Mr. So-and-so'll be right over.

40:11.155 --> 40:12.816
Just hold on one second.

40:12.857 --> 40:16.418
4789. Come on over, God damn it!

40:16.461 --> 40:17.985
What you mean,
don't curse at you?

40:18.029 --> 40:20.554
You're cursin' at me!
Fuck you, too!

40:20.598 --> 40:23.692
All that goddamn noise.

40:23.735 --> 40:27.171
You wouldn't believe the skirt
this girl has got on.

40:27.205 --> 40:30.504
lt's two inches above the thing.

40:45.256 --> 40:46.382
Damn.

40:46.424 --> 40:51.157
Hi. Let's do this, girl.

40:53.598 --> 40:56.658
The time is...

40:56.701 --> 40:58.601
l'm sorry.
l just finished dancing.

40:58.636 --> 41:02.766
Why girls be gettin' tired
real quick?

41:02.807 --> 41:05.571
lt's hot in here.
My hair is through.

41:05.610 --> 41:08.602
Put some use
to them corns on your feet.

41:08.646 --> 41:10.409
Maybe later, OK?

41:10.448 --> 41:12.643
You done turned down
thirty brothers.

41:12.683 --> 41:15.015
Don't make me walk
all the way back there...

41:15.052 --> 41:17.213
after climbing from
around the D.J. table...

41:17.255 --> 41:20.349
crossing the room,
obviously to ask you to dance.

41:20.391 --> 41:22.757
l'll be the object of ridicule.

41:22.794 --> 41:25.194
There's a lot of girls
not dancing.

41:25.229 --> 41:28.960
Want to know why?
Because they are homely.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.094
They need to be home
getting beauty sleep.

41:32.136 --> 41:34.934
What you think
they say about you?

41:34.972 --> 41:36.462
You heard something?

41:36.507 --> 41:38.737
Oh, no. Sharane!

41:43.381 --> 41:45.246
Kid, what's up?

41:45.283 --> 41:47.683
-You enjoying yourself?
-Definitely.

41:47.718 --> 41:49.083
l've known you too long.

41:49.120 --> 41:51.953
What's that look in your eye?
Scheming on Sidney or Sharane?

41:51.989 --> 41:53.513
Actually, l had my eye--

41:53.558 --> 41:57.358
Sidney's for you.
Sharane wants me.

41:57.395 --> 41:58.726
-She does?
-Every day.

41:58.763 --> 42:00.628
Besides, with your father...

42:00.665 --> 42:02.792
you can't deal
with no project girl.

42:02.834 --> 42:05.701
You gonna ill out on a girl
from the projects?

42:05.736 --> 42:07.260
You got it wrong.

42:07.305 --> 42:09.603
With a father like yours,
you have no privacy...

42:09.640 --> 42:13.838
no car, and no money
for a motel.

42:13.878 --> 42:15.846
You see my point?

42:15.880 --> 42:18.007
With a project girl,
someone's always home...

42:18.049 --> 42:20.449
and that's gonna mess
with your datin' time.

42:20.484 --> 42:22.247
Mating time.
Know what l'm saying?

42:22.286 --> 42:25.255
How's it look watching
television with Uncle Fester?

42:25.289 --> 42:27.223
-lt's Uncle Otis.
-Whatever.

42:27.258 --> 42:29.522
But Sidney has a home.

42:29.560 --> 42:31.892
A house with a rec room.

42:31.929 --> 42:35.262
You know what time it is.
Go downstairs.

42:35.299 --> 42:37.790
Sofa bed. You're in.

42:37.835 --> 42:40.497
-Why you playin' me?
-l'm not--

42:40.538 --> 42:42.597
Just 'cause you don't have
nice stuff at your crib...

42:42.640 --> 42:44.665
don't mess with my mother's.

42:49.013 --> 42:51.846
Your liver gonna
shrivel up like a prune.

42:51.883 --> 42:53.214
lt's hot.

42:55.152 --> 42:58.417
Become a man, come on.
Some of this.

42:58.456 --> 43:00.583
No, man. You better
slow down yourself.

43:00.625 --> 43:02.718
That monkey oil
is gonna mess you up good.

43:02.760 --> 43:04.250
l tried to tell him.

43:04.295 --> 43:05.922
Kid, you my man...

43:05.963 --> 43:08.454
but l tell you
you'll be out on the sauce...

43:08.499 --> 43:10.296
if you're not down with this.

43:10.334 --> 43:12.802
This stuff makes your dick hard.

43:12.837 --> 43:15.965
l'm talking cock-diesel, baby.

43:17.909 --> 43:21.572
Do that dance step
you was doin' out there.

43:21.612 --> 43:24.046
l've been trying to get
that all night.

43:24.081 --> 43:26.879
-l don't feel like it.
-Come on!

43:26.918 --> 43:28.977
l'm really not in the mood.

43:29.020 --> 43:31.420
Don't do it, then.
l'll learn on my own.

43:31.455 --> 43:34.219
Wait a minute.
Don't give up so easy.

43:34.258 --> 43:36.385
l knew you wouldn't
go out on me.

43:36.427 --> 43:37.917
l'll teach you.

43:37.962 --> 43:39.452
Cool, man.

43:39.497 --> 43:41.897
This is very complicated.

43:49.774 --> 43:53.141
-What are you doing?
-This ain't aerobics class.

43:53.177 --> 43:54.508
You can't do it.

43:54.545 --> 43:56.843
-ls that a challenge?
-lt is.

43:56.881 --> 43:59.577
-You better come on out here.
-Come on.

43:59.617 --> 44:03.178
And look, drunk.

44:03.220 --> 44:05.415
-Shall we do this?
-Let's do it.

44:25.676 --> 44:27.439
Don't be movin' me.

45:22.867 --> 45:24.698
They went to
the Rerun dance school.

45:24.735 --> 45:27.135
Go ahead. What you got?

45:56.000 --> 45:56.989
Switch!

46:06.911 --> 46:08.071
Switch!

46:13.184 --> 46:14.981
Switch!

46:25.196 --> 46:27.824
Bilal, switch again!

46:29.633 --> 46:31.396
Come on, man, switch!

47:02.967 --> 47:05.902
Did you see how Kid
was all up on me?

47:05.936 --> 47:07.062
On you?

47:07.104 --> 47:10.267
He was so far up on me,
l could not move.

47:10.307 --> 47:14.107
Wait a minute.
You said he was young-actin'.

47:14.145 --> 47:16.204
l did. l also said he was cute.

47:18.782 --> 47:19.771
Switch!

47:21.318 --> 47:25.311
l do everything l can for him,
and he don't come home.

47:25.356 --> 47:27.256
He must be crazy.

47:27.291 --> 47:29.350
He don't pay no bills
around this house.

47:29.393 --> 47:32.362
l'll give him another minute,
and that's it.

47:39.703 --> 47:41.796
What's wrong with this watch?

47:43.741 --> 47:46.403
Minute don't take
that damn long.

47:46.443 --> 47:49.378
Shit. l know where he's at.

47:55.719 --> 47:57.084
l'll kill him when l see him.

47:57.121 --> 47:58.850
l should have never married
that white woman.

47:58.889 --> 48:00.015
Hold it right there.

48:00.057 --> 48:01.217
Shit.

48:03.627 --> 48:05.390
Where are you going?

48:05.429 --> 48:07.556
l'm minding my fuckin' business.

48:07.598 --> 48:09.657
Do you have a problem with that?

48:09.700 --> 48:11.634
Again with the questions.

48:11.669 --> 48:13.261
What is this, "Jeopardy"?

48:13.304 --> 48:16.364
lt ain't "Jeopardy,"
or Monopoly, either...

48:16.407 --> 48:17.840
and l ain't going to jail.

48:17.875 --> 48:21.276
-Freeze!
-God damn.

48:21.312 --> 48:23.280
Y'all sound like
a set of bookends.

48:23.314 --> 48:26.977
Put your hands
on top of your head.

48:31.322 --> 48:32.414
Lean back.

48:32.456 --> 48:35.186
l know why you stopped me.

48:35.226 --> 48:39.185
'Cause l'm a poor black man
in a black neighborhood...

48:39.230 --> 48:41.664
and y'all just want
to bust my black ass.

48:41.699 --> 48:44.099
-No.
-You look suspicious.

48:44.134 --> 48:45.601
Ain't that a bitch?

48:45.636 --> 48:48.469
You look suspicious
and definitely black.

48:48.505 --> 48:49.870
Turn around.

48:49.907 --> 48:51.169
Your wife likes it.

48:51.208 --> 48:55.406
We're responding to a 415
in the neighborhood.

48:55.446 --> 48:58.040
You could be coming
from that disturbance.

48:58.082 --> 49:01.483
The only fuckin' disturbance
is you fuckin' with me.

49:01.518 --> 49:04.544
Don't think l can't read
no badge numbers, chump.

49:04.588 --> 49:07.955
Boyd and Warnarski.
l'll turn your ass in.

49:07.992 --> 49:09.289
That's enough, OK?

49:10.327 --> 49:11.453
Watch your attitude, pal.

49:11.495 --> 49:13.463
-Ain't that a bitch?
-Go home.

49:13.497 --> 49:17.797
Fuck you.
Officers of the goddamn law.

49:17.835 --> 49:21.896
-Go.
-l'm not ready.

49:21.939 --> 49:23.998
Go on home, pal.

49:24.041 --> 49:25.599
You don't know
who you fucking with.

49:25.643 --> 49:28.305
l'm from a small town called
"Fresh Off A Cop's Ass."

49:28.345 --> 49:30.643
You make me homesick.

49:30.681 --> 49:34.139
l'll find that damn boy.
Head like a whisk broom.

49:34.385 --> 49:39.220
Sharane and Sidney,
the two finest women in here.

49:39.256 --> 49:40.518
How could a man choose?

49:40.557 --> 49:41.785
He better choose right.

49:41.825 --> 49:44.055
lt's like that?

49:46.397 --> 49:47.864
Sharane, you are crazy.

49:47.898 --> 49:49.729
l really like that outfit
you got on.

49:49.767 --> 49:50.961
lt likes you, too.

49:51.001 --> 49:54.630
-And you got the boots.
-You like my boots?

49:54.672 --> 49:57.106
Look at your hair.
lt looks so nice.

49:57.141 --> 49:58.438
You got the braid
and everything.

49:58.475 --> 49:59.601
That's my jam !

49:59.643 --> 50:01.110
Check out this mix, boy.

50:01.145 --> 50:02.635
Yo, Sharane.

50:02.680 --> 50:04.375
Dope.

50:06.717 --> 50:07.684
Yo, baby.

50:07.718 --> 50:09.310
Let's do it, darling.

50:09.353 --> 50:11.253
Want to dance, baby?

50:11.288 --> 50:12.619
Damn.

50:17.061 --> 50:19.495
-Like to dance?
-No.

50:22.700 --> 50:25.362
You sure
you don't want to dance?

50:25.402 --> 50:26.926
l'm quite sure.

50:28.205 --> 50:30.673
Can l sit down?

50:30.708 --> 50:33.108
lt's a free country.

50:36.513 --> 50:39.311
When l saw you
turn that other guy down...

50:39.350 --> 50:42.979
l knew that the odds
were against me.

50:43.020 --> 50:44.612
Don't take it personal.

50:44.655 --> 50:49.490
l didn't take it personal
when you asked me after Sharane.

50:55.399 --> 50:58.061
What's your middle name?

50:58.102 --> 50:59.592
LaToya.

51:01.739 --> 51:06.039
Sidney. That's a nice name.

51:06.076 --> 51:07.805
You sure
you don't want to dance?

51:07.845 --> 51:10.040
l'm still tired. My feet.

51:10.080 --> 51:11.411
Your feet.

51:11.448 --> 51:14.349
Your mother should
buy you a bigger shoe size.

51:14.385 --> 51:15.409
That would help.

51:19.390 --> 51:22.257
That outfit you got on
is really nice.

51:22.292 --> 51:24.556
-Pierre Cardin?
-No.

51:24.595 --> 51:27.257
l knew it wasn't Pierre Cardin.

51:27.297 --> 51:30.391
All right, fellas,
it's time to go to work.

51:34.772 --> 51:37.434
You sure you don't want
to dance?

51:39.443 --> 51:41.138
Maybe on a fast song.

51:41.178 --> 51:44.272
l'm really not into slow songs.

51:45.416 --> 51:48.317
-Whazzup?
-You want to dance?

51:48.352 --> 51:52.254
Can't you see
l'm talking to my girl?

51:52.289 --> 51:55.622
l should have sat out
the last one like you did.

51:55.659 --> 51:56.887
l'm about to die.

51:56.927 --> 51:59.521
-Ready to go yet?
-What's wrong?

51:59.563 --> 52:01.622
You can't go until
you give me what you owe me.

52:01.665 --> 52:05.123
-Owe?
-Just a dance.

52:05.169 --> 52:07.262
lt's late. We're ready to go.

52:07.304 --> 52:09.534
Let's just dance right now.

52:09.573 --> 52:11.404
l usually don't dance
on slow records...

52:11.442 --> 52:13.842
but l will
if you won't grind on me.

52:13.877 --> 52:16.744
Come on.

52:17.848 --> 52:19.577
Don't be feelin' on my butt.

52:28.525 --> 52:34.589
You so soft and comfy,
like my Hush Puppies.

52:34.631 --> 52:39.432
You so warm and fluffy
like a buttermilk biscuit.

52:39.470 --> 52:41.370
Shoot.

52:41.405 --> 52:47.207
You make me want to squeeze
tighter and tighter.

52:47.244 --> 52:49.576
l ain't gonna lie.

52:49.613 --> 52:51.808
You make a motherfucker
want to sing.

52:53.317 --> 52:57.310
Always and forever

52:58.222 --> 53:02.124
Each moment with you

53:02.759 --> 53:08.129
ls just like
a dream to me and you

53:08.165 --> 53:12.192
That somehow came true

53:38.962 --> 53:40.759
Honeys. Oh, yes.

53:40.797 --> 53:43.163
Yo, fellas!

53:44.735 --> 53:46.430
lt's cool.

53:46.470 --> 53:47.767
What's the problem?

53:47.804 --> 53:51.103
No problem.
No hoods allowed at my party.

53:51.141 --> 53:53.132
-Hoods?
-That's right.

53:53.176 --> 53:55.144
Why don't y'all
go rob a liquor store?

53:55.178 --> 53:56.475
Why don't you quit playin'?

53:56.513 --> 53:59.607
lf l'd known you were coming,
l'd have had metal detectors.

53:59.650 --> 54:02.949
-That shit is real funny.
-Real funny.

54:02.986 --> 54:04.248
Don't touch my body, man.

54:04.288 --> 54:07.314
Big man. Don't touch his body.

54:07.357 --> 54:10.952
Look at that.
Bunch of punk motherfuckers.

54:10.994 --> 54:12.552
You smell something?

54:12.596 --> 54:14.791
l definitely smell
something out here.

54:14.831 --> 54:17.698
l smell pussies!

54:17.734 --> 54:19.463
Forget this, man.

54:19.503 --> 54:21.095
Forget all these chumps.

54:23.040 --> 54:26.203
We would smell like pussies
to a bunch of dicks!

54:26.243 --> 54:27.301
Shit!

54:27.344 --> 54:30.643
lt's cool. Forget this, man.

54:30.681 --> 54:33.741
l don't want to hang out
with this sucker set.

54:33.784 --> 54:37.242
What l'd like to do
is hurt that punk Kid.

54:37.287 --> 54:39.585
lf you was a real man,
you'd come out here...

54:39.623 --> 54:41.147
and we'd squash this!

54:41.191 --> 54:42.522
That's right, punk!

54:42.559 --> 54:44.754
Get him when he's alone.
l told you.

54:44.795 --> 54:46.126
Too many people around, man.

54:46.163 --> 54:49.462
l'd really love to come
out and play with you...

54:49.499 --> 54:53.196
but l'm busy right now
with your girl on my lap.

54:53.236 --> 54:54.635
Shit!

54:54.671 --> 54:57.265
Your shoulder OK?

54:57.307 --> 54:59.798
Fuck this, man.

55:02.879 --> 55:04.938
We can't let them
get away with that.

55:04.982 --> 55:06.210
See what happened?

55:06.249 --> 55:08.979
We ought to go back
and kick some ass.

55:09.019 --> 55:11.715
We just got dissed
by some punk motherfuckers?

55:11.755 --> 55:13.620
We got dissed
by some motherfuckers.

55:13.657 --> 55:16.251
ln front of their girls.

55:16.293 --> 55:20.024
l ain't goin' out like that.

55:20.063 --> 55:22.964
Cool.
Finally, a program l'm with.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.865
Whatever this is, l'm with it.

55:26.470 --> 55:27.937
l hear that.

55:27.971 --> 55:31.304
We bust their ass as they
run out of the burning house.

55:31.341 --> 55:32.774
Let's get moving.

55:32.809 --> 55:34.970
Burning house?

55:35.012 --> 55:37.037
Hold up for a second.

55:37.080 --> 55:40.208
l was talking about
kicking some ass...

55:40.250 --> 55:41.512
not burning people up.

55:41.551 --> 55:43.041
Now you're going too far.

55:43.086 --> 55:45.680
Y'all frontin' on me?

55:45.722 --> 55:49.055
Wait. Do l smell pussy?

55:49.092 --> 55:50.821
l ain't no pussy.

55:50.861 --> 55:53.523
Shut up! Squash that!
Come on!

55:53.563 --> 55:54.825
What's wrong with him?

55:54.865 --> 55:56.457
Come on!

55:58.068 --> 55:59.592
What's the matter with you?

55:59.636 --> 56:01.866
Why you want to burn people up?

56:01.905 --> 56:03.896
Come on, come on.

56:05.142 --> 56:06.302
What's up with the mike?

56:06.343 --> 56:08.368
Easy! Thank you.

56:08.412 --> 56:10.380
Play and Kid got an urge...

56:10.414 --> 56:13.008
to make a fool
of themselves in public.

56:14.451 --> 56:16.112
Hey, wait a minute, baby.

56:16.153 --> 56:18.280
Let me show you how
to hold a piece of steel.

56:18.321 --> 56:20.846
-Scared of you.
-You should be.

56:20.891 --> 56:23.257
-Go on.
-l will.

56:24.494 --> 56:26.621
One, two. One, two.

56:26.663 --> 56:28.392
Give me a little volume
on this microphone.

56:28.432 --> 56:29.524
Let's get this party jumping.

56:29.566 --> 56:31.830
All the ladies, all the ladies

56:31.868 --> 56:34.428
All the ladies
in the house say ow

56:35.439 --> 56:36.736
Say ow

56:37.407 --> 56:38.965
Come on, come on

56:39.009 --> 56:40.271
Homeboys, make some noise

56:40.310 --> 56:42.437
l said, homeboys,
make some noise

56:42.479 --> 56:44.447
Let me hear you say ho

56:45.449 --> 56:46.643
Say ho, ho

56:47.718 --> 56:49.310
The roof, the roof

56:49.352 --> 56:51.877
Y'all like that
old prehistoric stuff?

56:51.922 --> 56:53.514
We don't need no water

56:53.557 --> 56:55.218
Let the motherfucker burn

56:55.258 --> 56:57.590
-Say what?
-Burn, motherfucker!

56:57.627 --> 56:59.925
l don't believe this.

56:59.963 --> 57:01.692
Didn't the Sugarhill Gang
do that rap?

57:01.732 --> 57:04.257
The roof is on fire

57:04.301 --> 57:05.700
We don't need no water

57:05.736 --> 57:07.670
Let the motherfucker burn

57:14.978 --> 57:17.776
Who got a light?

57:17.814 --> 57:19.247
How about a Bud Light?

57:19.282 --> 57:22.615
-Shit.
-Get in there.

57:24.654 --> 57:26.121
Shit.

57:32.729 --> 57:34.219
Fuck you toy cops, man.

57:34.264 --> 57:37.791
-Don't call it in.
-Why not?

57:37.834 --> 57:40.598
Why bother with the paperwork?
We can handle this shit.

57:40.637 --> 57:42.502
What do you got in mind?

57:42.539 --> 57:44.473
Let's take them
down to the docks.

57:44.508 --> 57:46.169
Nobody can hear them scream.

57:46.209 --> 57:47.369
Shit!

57:48.345 --> 57:50.040
lt's the P-L-A-Y

57:50.080 --> 57:51.377
Just here to say hi

57:51.414 --> 57:53.678
Asking you may l
tell you about the day l

57:53.717 --> 57:56.345
Picked up a microphone,
a pad, and a pen?

57:56.386 --> 57:57.876
The legend
of the champ begins

57:57.921 --> 57:59.286
The party host with the most

57:59.322 --> 58:00.653
Giving you a dose, see?

58:00.690 --> 58:02.419
Leaving instructions,
so listen closely

58:02.459 --> 58:03.585
Two lines forming

58:03.627 --> 58:04.992
Make sure you step soon

58:05.028 --> 58:06.996
Fellas at the back door,
girls by the bedroom

58:07.030 --> 58:09.362
The name is Play,
don't dare play me cheap

58:09.399 --> 58:10.696
The microphone is a broom

58:10.734 --> 58:12.292
And l'm going
to sweep you off your feet

58:12.335 --> 58:14.303
With feelings
that you never felt

58:14.337 --> 58:15.497
Another notch in the belt

58:15.539 --> 58:16.801
lt's no secret

58:16.840 --> 58:18.603
l like to freak
with the best of them

58:18.642 --> 58:20.769
Then head to the stage
in a test of men

58:20.811 --> 58:23.507
And when it's done and said
and said and done

58:23.547 --> 58:25.742
Play's gonna be
the victorious one

58:27.818 --> 58:30.116
Dope, ain't it?
l know.

58:30.153 --> 58:32.485
-Give me that mike.
-You want some?

58:32.522 --> 58:33.784
lt's my turn.

58:33.824 --> 58:35.086
l'm never 'fessin',
possessin' the tools

58:35.125 --> 58:36.387
That it takes to rock

58:36.426 --> 58:38.894
l think it's time
for the new kid on the block

58:38.929 --> 58:40.920
With a style that's wild,
yet so unique

58:40.964 --> 58:42.955
l can't be stopped
from reachin' my peak

58:42.999 --> 58:45.467
Because givin' my all,
that's how l got to live

58:45.502 --> 58:47.527
lt's my prerogative,
so you know l gotta give

58:47.571 --> 58:49.732
More for the dance floor,
and l'll make your brain sore

58:49.773 --> 58:51.798
Kid's revvin' and buzzin'
just like a chain saw

58:51.842 --> 58:54.709
One look, you'll say, damn, man,
that Kid needs a grand, man

58:54.744 --> 58:56.302
'Cause l bust a handstand
on "American Bandstand"

58:56.346 --> 58:59.076
With ease, l please
and make your mind freeze

58:59.115 --> 59:00.912
Straight out the Eighties,
right into the Nineties

59:00.951 --> 59:03.419
Givin' you the highs
and lows like a drama

59:03.453 --> 59:06.047
And if the mike's got juice,
you know, l'm a-keep wailin'

59:06.089 --> 59:07.579
You know l'll have you
starin' a while

59:07.624 --> 59:10.593
Because the Kid's much more
than hair and a smile

59:12.562 --> 59:14.154
There it is, the hype shit.

59:14.197 --> 59:16.392
You think you all that now?

59:16.433 --> 59:17.764
Yup. And then some.

59:17.801 --> 59:19.063
Bust it.

59:19.102 --> 59:21.195
lt's my party,
and l rhyme if l want to

59:21.238 --> 59:23.604
Be careful and don't you
step to the front to

59:23.640 --> 59:25.972
Dis, 'cause l'm gonna
dismiss with a def kiss

59:26.009 --> 59:28.000
And make you sorry that
you ever stepped to this

59:28.044 --> 59:30.535
Microphone wizard,
so come on, place your bet

59:30.580 --> 59:32.605
ls it gonna be me or Eraserhead?

59:32.649 --> 59:34.913
Why put your money
on a sorry old poor thing

59:34.951 --> 59:36.680
When you can get behind
a sure thing?

59:36.720 --> 59:39.280
And that's me, the capital "P"
on the hype tip

59:39.322 --> 59:41.654
One false move, and you'll
get your ass whipped

59:41.691 --> 59:43.591
Just tell me how the rhymes
and the cuts sound

59:43.627 --> 59:45.788
You won't start feelin' the pain
till you touch ground

59:45.829 --> 59:48.423
Boy, you goin' way out,
l'm ready to serve you

59:48.465 --> 59:50.399
lf you can stay out
past your Pop's curfew

59:50.433 --> 59:52.298
Look at him,
already a has-been

59:52.335 --> 59:55.065
Let Uncle Play say a rhyme
that'll tuck your ass in

59:57.807 --> 59:59.274
Am l paid or what?

59:59.309 --> 01:00:02.472
You some kind of foul,
you know what l'm saying?

01:00:02.512 --> 01:00:05.640
Once again, the boy blows smoke
about what he want to be

01:00:05.682 --> 01:00:08.378
But it isn't and wasn't,
and it ain't never gonna be

01:00:08.418 --> 01:00:10.443
Possible,
'cause l got lots of pull

01:00:10.487 --> 01:00:12.785
And when you rhyme,
whoo, there's lots of bull

01:00:12.822 --> 01:00:14.221
When it comes time
to step to a mike

01:00:14.257 --> 01:00:15.519
l don't sit around

01:00:15.558 --> 01:00:16.957
Play, you know
l don't kid around

01:00:16.993 --> 01:00:19.427
So come with it, boy,
don't even hide your best

01:00:19.462 --> 01:00:21.794
'Cause Kid spelled backwards
describes you best

01:00:21.831 --> 01:00:24.095
Look around, watch the people
clap hands in unity

01:00:24.134 --> 01:00:26.261
As the momentum
swings from you to me

01:00:26.303 --> 01:00:28.737
You issued a challenge,
yeah, you threw it up

01:00:28.772 --> 01:00:30.933
Step to the stage,
too late, l blew it up

01:00:30.974 --> 01:00:33.169
The knowledge to build,
just filled with excellence

01:00:33.209 --> 01:00:35.336
You heard the rhymes,
you've been petro ever since

01:00:35.378 --> 01:00:37.676
There's no missin'
the words that l laid out

01:00:37.714 --> 01:00:39.545
You didn't play,
you just got played out

01:00:46.256 --> 01:00:48.952
Anything y'all could do,
l also could do...

01:00:48.992 --> 01:00:50.823
but l could also do it better.

01:01:08.979 --> 01:01:10.469
What the...

01:01:14.484 --> 01:01:18.079
Oh, baby.
The police been here...

01:01:18.121 --> 01:01:21.352
and they still
down there dancing.

01:01:21.391 --> 01:01:24.918
Come back to bed, Harry.

01:01:24.961 --> 01:01:26.553
Harry?

01:01:28.765 --> 01:01:30.858
What's up? Enjoying yourselves?

01:01:33.370 --> 01:01:34.598
Damn, Groove...

01:01:34.637 --> 01:01:37.629
why you got to play
the alky role at my party?

01:01:47.183 --> 01:01:49.447
Man, l told you
to go way over there.

01:01:49.486 --> 01:01:50.612
You bump this table again...

01:01:50.653 --> 01:01:54.214
l'm going to kick
your fucking heart out.

01:01:54.257 --> 01:01:56.157
l've been looking
all over for you.

01:01:56.192 --> 01:01:57.523
Help me haul this fool home.

01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:59.221
You're doing a great job.

01:01:59.262 --> 01:02:00.854
Why you hang out
with that sucker?

01:02:00.897 --> 01:02:03.195
That ain't important.
This is.

01:02:03.233 --> 01:02:04.495
Would you help me
haul this fool home?

01:02:04.534 --> 01:02:07.628
l told you don't invite him.

01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:11.106
Groove! Get up, man.

01:02:11.141 --> 01:02:12.130
Let me go, man.

01:02:12.175 --> 01:02:15.872
The turf! Excuse me!

01:02:15.912 --> 01:02:18.881
Watch your back!
Groove might throw up!

01:02:18.915 --> 01:02:22.282
We're ready to go home.
Want to come?

01:02:22.318 --> 01:02:27.051
OK. My pops wants me home
by 11:00, anyway.

01:02:27.090 --> 01:02:29.456
-11:00?
-Not 11:00.

01:02:29.492 --> 01:02:31.858
11:30, 11:35.

01:02:31.895 --> 01:02:33.863
Did you see where Play went?

01:02:33.897 --> 01:02:36.161
l saw Chill and Play
carrying Groove home.

01:02:37.567 --> 01:02:39.762
He promised us a ride home.

01:02:39.803 --> 01:02:41.794
l don't mind walking you home.

01:02:41.838 --> 01:02:43.567
lt's not as good
as a ride, but...

01:02:43.606 --> 01:02:47.167
Cool. l think Sidney's
ready to leave anyway.

01:02:48.978 --> 01:02:51.037
Kid said he'll walk us home.

01:02:51.081 --> 01:02:54.107
We'll go get his coat
and your purse.

01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:58.143
Aren't you going
to wait for Play?

01:02:58.188 --> 01:03:00.748
Don't be up there all night.

01:03:00.790 --> 01:03:03.054
Kids got it easy nowadays.

01:03:03.093 --> 01:03:04.492
My father said,
"Stay your ass at home..."

01:03:04.527 --> 01:03:07.291
you stayed your ass at home.

01:03:07.330 --> 01:03:09.662
Wait till l find him.
l'm going to kill him !

01:03:17.107 --> 01:03:18.540
You're drunk as a fish.

01:03:18.575 --> 01:03:20.509
Come tomorrow,
you the first one in church.

01:03:20.543 --> 01:03:22.101
Who said something about church?

01:03:22.145 --> 01:03:23.806
l see the light

01:03:23.847 --> 01:03:25.678
l see the light

01:03:35.191 --> 01:03:38.092
l don't want to see nobody.
Let's go.

01:03:43.066 --> 01:03:45.557
James, is that you?

01:03:54.511 --> 01:03:56.809
-My boy here?
-No, sir. Who's he?

01:03:56.846 --> 01:03:58.473
You know who he is.

01:03:58.515 --> 01:04:00.506
-He in here?
-No.

01:04:03.753 --> 01:04:06.847
You ought to be ashamed,
messin' up these folks' house.

01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:08.118
Know it ain't paid for.

01:04:08.158 --> 01:04:11.719
Y'all in here doing some wrong!

01:04:11.761 --> 01:04:14.730
Bilal--whatever your name is.

01:04:14.764 --> 01:04:16.823
Sounds like something
you catch on your feet.

01:04:16.866 --> 01:04:18.197
You seen my boy?

01:04:18.234 --> 01:04:19.496
l haven't seen him, sir.

01:04:19.536 --> 01:04:23.836
You sure?
You ain't seen him?

01:04:23.873 --> 01:04:26.103
Why don't you go home
and watch the late show, Pops?

01:04:28.244 --> 01:04:32.578
Why don't you go home,
little test-tube baby?

01:04:33.716 --> 01:04:35.843
-What's your name?
-Clinton.

01:04:35.885 --> 01:04:39.616
-Clinton what?
-Clinton X.

01:04:41.758 --> 01:04:42.884
Clinton X?

01:04:42.926 --> 01:04:45.588
Yeah, Clinton x.
l'm a Muslim.

01:04:45.628 --> 01:04:49.689
Get me two bean pies
and a pork chop sandwich...

01:04:49.732 --> 01:04:52.530
you little
trout-mouthed heathen.

01:04:52.569 --> 01:04:54.628
Oh, how you doing?

01:04:54.671 --> 01:04:56.969
l should've known you was here.
Saw the drippings outside.

01:04:57.006 --> 01:05:00.601
With your Jheri-Curl,
better never do a crime.

01:05:00.643 --> 01:05:02.907
The police would have
no problem finding you.

01:05:02.946 --> 01:05:04.709
Follow the drip.

01:05:04.747 --> 01:05:06.612
No problem finding you.

01:05:06.649 --> 01:05:08.776
Bilal, where's the boy at?
Upstairs?

01:05:11.721 --> 01:05:13.279
ls the boy upstairs?

01:05:13.323 --> 01:05:15.484
Wait!

01:05:15.525 --> 01:05:18.323
Play told me to make sure
nobody went upstairs...

01:05:18.361 --> 01:05:21.125
'cause his parents
just got new carpet.

01:05:21.164 --> 01:05:24.258
And he don't want nobody
with shit on their shoes--

01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:27.269
-Did l say "shit"?
-You did.

01:05:27.303 --> 01:05:29.271
You talking about my shoes?

01:05:29.305 --> 01:05:32.206
No. Nobody can
walk around up there.

01:05:32.242 --> 01:05:35.075
l understand.
So nobody been up there?

01:05:35.111 --> 01:05:36.976
Ain't nobody up there.
l don't play.

01:05:37.013 --> 01:05:39.777
l don't play, either.

01:05:39.816 --> 01:05:42.546
l ain't got time to play games
with you damn kids.

01:05:42.585 --> 01:05:45.019
He got to come home sometime.

01:05:45.054 --> 01:05:47.181
l'll be waiting
on his monkey ass.

01:05:47.223 --> 01:05:48.952
Get out of the damn way.

01:05:48.992 --> 01:05:52.120
l'll be like a security guard,
waiting for him.

01:05:52.161 --> 01:05:54.459
Get out of my way.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.558
Look.

01:05:58.601 --> 01:06:01.035
Just make yourself at home.

01:06:01.070 --> 01:06:03.095
What's Play's mama
doing with this dress?

01:06:03.139 --> 01:06:05.607
She ought to give this to me.

01:06:05.642 --> 01:06:07.906
lt does look kind of nice.

01:06:07.944 --> 01:06:10.003
Let me help you
with that dress, huh?

01:06:10.046 --> 01:06:12.480
What do you think?

01:06:12.515 --> 01:06:14.608
Hold. What you doing?

01:06:14.651 --> 01:06:16.209
Helping you with the dress.

01:06:16.252 --> 01:06:18.117
You got to take things
slow at first.

01:06:18.154 --> 01:06:20.349
-Kid, your--
-What?

01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:23.951
Nothing. l just came
to get my pocketbook.

01:06:23.993 --> 01:06:25.927
We was about to get it.

01:06:25.962 --> 01:06:27.122
And now we're not.

01:06:27.163 --> 01:06:29.927
Now l know
it's time for us to go.

01:06:29.966 --> 01:06:31.661
Let's go out the back way.

01:06:31.701 --> 01:06:36.832
l told Play l'd help clean up.
l don't want to run into him.

01:06:36.873 --> 01:06:42.038
You'd run into a lot more
than Play out front.

01:06:42.612 --> 01:06:46.207
What are you doing on Friday?

01:06:46.249 --> 01:06:50.117
l don't know.
Why don't you call me tomorrow?

01:06:50.153 --> 01:06:53.816
A lot of guys get nervous
in the projects.

01:06:53.856 --> 01:06:56.017
Why would they be punks
like that?

01:06:56.059 --> 01:06:59.927
After Mr. Williams' son started
sniping people from the roof...

01:06:59.962 --> 01:07:03.363
guys drop me off on the corner
and tell me to call them.

01:07:07.403 --> 01:07:10.167
l shouldn't make plans
for this weekend.

01:07:10.206 --> 01:07:12.231
lt depends if my father
lets me off punishment...

01:07:12.275 --> 01:07:14.300
for getting into
that fight at school.

01:07:14.344 --> 01:07:16.539
Friday may not be
good for me, either.

01:07:16.579 --> 01:07:20.071
We'll talk tomorrow in school.

01:07:29.559 --> 01:07:32.653
-Come on, now.
-Don't beg.

01:07:33.963 --> 01:07:35.123
Later.

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.428
Good night.

01:07:49.245 --> 01:07:51.805
l'll be back.

01:08:09.165 --> 01:08:11.156
Do l detect jealousy?

01:08:12.201 --> 01:08:15.637
Why tease him?
"Let's get together Friday."

01:08:15.671 --> 01:08:17.502
Didn't you say
the same shit to Play?

01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:20.064
One's in trouble,
the other one's available.

01:08:20.109 --> 01:08:21.201
l'm just playing averages.

01:08:21.243 --> 01:08:22.904
They're friends!

01:08:22.944 --> 01:08:25.538
Cute ones always travel
in packs.

01:08:25.581 --> 01:08:28.515
But why is old ugly Bilal
with his breath...

01:08:28.551 --> 01:08:30.381
hanging out with them?

01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:32.752
l can't believe
you're acting like this.

01:08:32.788 --> 01:08:35.053
What?

01:08:36.125 --> 01:08:38.354
Let me tell you something.
Life is short.

01:08:38.394 --> 01:08:40.953
lf you want something,
let the chips fall.

01:08:40.997 --> 01:08:42.988
You're mad because
you didn't catch one.

01:08:43.032 --> 01:08:45.125
That may not be by accident.

01:08:45.167 --> 01:08:49.036
You didn't like him
till he was up on me.

01:08:49.071 --> 01:08:51.562
That is bullshit.
He was up on me first.

01:08:51.607 --> 01:08:55.337
Why you think
l didn't talk to him...

01:08:55.377 --> 01:08:57.209
even though l knew
you were playing him?

01:08:57.246 --> 01:08:59.578
Then you put him
all up in my face.

01:08:59.615 --> 01:09:01.947
l'm out of here.
l don't want to hear it.

01:09:02.952 --> 01:09:05.819
He's still got
to walk you home, right?

01:09:05.854 --> 01:09:08.085
lf you think l'm dogging him,
try and take him.

01:09:08.124 --> 01:09:11.149
-l ain't like you.
-That's why you're mad.

01:09:11.194 --> 01:09:13.685
-Ho.
-l heard you.

01:09:19.502 --> 01:09:20.992
What's wrong?

01:09:21.037 --> 01:09:24.029
You don't have to walk me home.

01:09:24.073 --> 01:09:26.974
-l don't mind.
-l kind of do mind.

01:09:27.009 --> 01:09:30.671
You beefed at me all night.
What did l do to you?

01:09:30.712 --> 01:09:33.408
You didn't do anything.

01:09:33.448 --> 01:09:35.609
lt's just l want to be alone.

01:09:35.651 --> 01:09:37.448
l don't think
that's a good idea...

01:09:37.487 --> 01:09:40.786
so l'm going to bug you
all the way home.

01:09:40.823 --> 01:09:43.256
You should be
heading home yourself.

01:09:43.292 --> 01:09:45.522
Why? l'm already in trouble.

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:48.654
Might as well have fun now
and suffer later.

01:09:48.698 --> 01:09:50.756
l can only die once.

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.098
Yeah, but punishments
are forever.

01:09:53.135 --> 01:09:54.796
That's true.

01:09:54.837 --> 01:09:57.806
One time my father put me
on punishment for a month...

01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.899
because l came home late
from a party.

01:09:59.942 --> 01:10:01.773
l still get depressed
thinking about that.

01:10:01.811 --> 01:10:05.110
Think about it
when the time comes.

01:10:05.147 --> 01:10:10.881
My pops is cool,
but he's too overprotective.

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:14.287
l heard about your mom's
passing. l'm sorry.

01:10:14.323 --> 01:10:18.521
Yeah. That was a while ago.

01:10:18.561 --> 01:10:21.223
What do your folks do?

01:10:21.264 --> 01:10:23.528
My dad owns
a couple of grocery stores.

01:10:23.566 --> 01:10:27.024
l know y'all
been snacking down.

01:10:27.069 --> 01:10:30.061
Crazy chips and dips.

01:10:30.106 --> 01:10:32.870
My mom works in a bank
in bookkeeping.

01:10:32.909 --> 01:10:35.002
At least you got a job
when you graduate.

01:10:35.044 --> 01:10:36.705
But l'm going to college.

01:10:36.746 --> 01:10:37.940
So am l.

01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:40.278
l already started checking out
the applications.

01:10:40.316 --> 01:10:43.945
Really? Aren't those
applications confusing?

01:10:43.986 --> 01:10:46.511
Especially
those lvy League schools.

01:10:46.556 --> 01:10:49.252
l ain't getting
all that far yet...

01:10:49.292 --> 01:10:52.022
lvy League
or nothing like that.

01:10:54.096 --> 01:10:55.723
What's up, fellas?

01:10:55.765 --> 01:10:58.256
You didn't take all the women
while we were gone?

01:10:58.301 --> 01:11:01.327
-A few.
-Right.

01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:04.897
-Someone is living foul.
-This nigger here.

01:11:04.941 --> 01:11:06.340
Take care of that, please.

01:11:06.375 --> 01:11:08.138
Did y'all two watch
the stuff like l asked?

01:11:08.177 --> 01:11:09.405
Because if a brother
like Play get vict...

01:11:09.445 --> 01:11:11.845
l'll have to do
some body and fender work.

01:11:11.881 --> 01:11:14.179
There was some niggers
clocking your shit.

01:11:14.216 --> 01:11:16.377
Was they clocking it as hard
as you should be clocking...

01:11:16.419 --> 01:11:18.478
them bugs dropping
out of your hair?

01:11:19.589 --> 01:11:20.783
Nigger got hair like Bob.

01:11:20.823 --> 01:11:23.485
-Bob who?
-Bob Wire, motherfucker.

01:11:24.493 --> 01:11:25.460
Real funny, man.

01:11:25.494 --> 01:11:28.395
You're crazy.

01:11:28.431 --> 01:11:29.796
Who broke the toilet?

01:11:31.601 --> 01:11:32.659
l don't know.

01:11:32.702 --> 01:11:36.103
Don't play me like this.
Who broke the toilet?

01:11:36.138 --> 01:11:39.232
lt was like that
when l came in here, wasn't it?

01:11:39.275 --> 01:11:40.936
Bet it was that nigger
in the leather jacket.

01:11:40.977 --> 01:11:43.468
-He could shit some bricks.
-Neck like Mike Tyson.

01:11:43.512 --> 01:11:45.639
"Play, when's your next party?"

01:11:45.681 --> 01:11:47.911
l put you in my house,
and you dog me.

01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:50.111
Look at the log
in that motherfucker.

01:11:50.152 --> 01:11:52.552
l got to do something
before my mother gets back.

01:11:52.588 --> 01:11:55.216
l'd help you, man,
but l got my new kicks on.

01:11:55.257 --> 01:11:57.122
See the next time
l throw a party!

01:11:57.159 --> 01:11:58.285
l'm sorry, man.

01:11:58.327 --> 01:12:00.488
l'm out of here.

01:12:00.529 --> 01:12:03.521
Y'all out of here?
l got a better idea.

01:12:03.566 --> 01:12:04.965
Bust it. Party's over.

01:12:05.001 --> 01:12:06.468
What?

01:12:06.502 --> 01:12:08.470
Don't say nothing to me, man.

01:12:08.504 --> 01:12:11.473
When you see me in the streets,
don't say nothing.

01:12:11.507 --> 01:12:12.667
l ain't no plumber.

01:12:12.708 --> 01:12:14.198
Step!

01:12:14.243 --> 01:12:15.437
l didn't even piss.

01:12:15.478 --> 01:12:18.538
-That's cold.
-Just step.

01:12:18.581 --> 01:12:20.139
-Peace, man.
-Damn.

01:12:24.186 --> 01:12:25.312
Shit!

01:12:25.588 --> 01:12:27.146
Hold up, OK?

01:12:29.892 --> 01:12:32.690
Good. l beat them home.

01:12:32.728 --> 01:12:36.721
You girls scheme on a level
guys don't have a clue about.

01:12:39.135 --> 01:12:43.003
l'm glad you let me
walk you home.

01:12:43.039 --> 01:12:44.631
You're all right.

01:12:44.674 --> 01:12:47.666
You pretty chill your damn self.

01:12:49.178 --> 01:12:50.167
Did you kiss her?

01:12:51.647 --> 01:12:52.807
Did l kiss who?

01:12:54.617 --> 01:12:56.915
Tonight. Did you kiss Sharane?

01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:59.317
No, l didn't.

01:13:01.323 --> 01:13:02.551
But you wanted to.

01:13:02.591 --> 01:13:05.526
Well...

01:13:05.561 --> 01:13:07.222
But l didn't.

01:13:07.263 --> 01:13:09.424
And l didn't know her
the way l know you now.

01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:18.063
OK, so l'll see you later,
all right?

01:13:20.176 --> 01:13:21.336
Tomorrow.

01:13:23.179 --> 01:13:27.411
l would let you in
and everything, but...

01:13:27.450 --> 01:13:31.250
it's late,
and you got to get home...

01:13:31.287 --> 01:13:34.347
and my parents
will be here any minute.

01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:36.483
l understand completely.

01:13:36.525 --> 01:13:38.550
lt's not a problem.

01:14:15.264 --> 01:14:16.993
Kid, wait.

01:14:18.334 --> 01:14:19.926
What?

01:14:19.969 --> 01:14:21.436
What are we doing here?

01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:23.734
We were doing fine
until you stopped me.

01:14:23.773 --> 01:14:25.502
A few minutes ago...

01:14:25.541 --> 01:14:27.839
you were trying to make
a date with my best friend.

01:14:27.877 --> 01:14:29.003
This isn't right.

01:14:29.044 --> 01:14:30.568
lt's not right?

01:14:30.613 --> 01:14:31.910
l'll tell you what's not right--

01:14:31.947 --> 01:14:34.438
the way you keep fronting on me.

01:14:34.483 --> 01:14:38.112
So all you want is sex,
even from best friends?

01:14:38.154 --> 01:14:40.054
l ain't forcing you
to do nothing.

01:14:40.089 --> 01:14:43.058
lf you want me to leave, fine.

01:14:43.092 --> 01:14:45.322
No problem.

01:14:45.361 --> 01:14:48.262
Wait, wait, wait.
Sidney, wait up.

01:14:48.297 --> 01:14:50.162
What is it you're asking me?

01:14:50.199 --> 01:14:53.930
l'm not asking for anything.
lt's about what you want.

01:14:57.239 --> 01:14:58.570
This is a trick question, right?

01:15:01.443 --> 01:15:03.775
l ain't going to lie.

01:15:03.813 --> 01:15:05.144
l'm attracted to both of you...

01:15:05.181 --> 01:15:07.149
but if l have
to make a choice...

01:15:07.183 --> 01:15:08.650
and that seems to be
what you're asking--

01:15:08.684 --> 01:15:11.380
then you're
who l want as a friend.

01:15:16.892 --> 01:15:18.951
lf you go with someone...

01:15:18.994 --> 01:15:20.928
you should be friends
as well as lovers.

01:15:35.211 --> 01:15:38.874
So now that we're friends...

01:15:39.882 --> 01:15:41.406
let's get with the loving.

01:15:46.522 --> 01:15:48.046
You think you slick, huh?

01:15:49.859 --> 01:15:52.327
Now l have a question for you.

01:15:52.361 --> 01:15:53.623
What?

01:15:53.662 --> 01:15:55.527
Are you on the pill?

01:15:55.564 --> 01:15:58.692
No. l don't do this regular.

01:15:58.734 --> 01:16:01.498
What about
one of those diagrams?

01:16:01.537 --> 01:16:05.166
That's diaphragm,
and l don't do sponges, either.

01:16:05.207 --> 01:16:08.904
Don't you have a whatchamacallit
in your wallet?

01:16:13.883 --> 01:16:16.147
l knew this would come in handy.

01:16:16.185 --> 01:16:19.052
lt's been in here a while.

01:16:19.088 --> 01:16:20.851
Still good.

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:26.960
All right.

01:16:33.369 --> 01:16:37.032
l guess it's been in here
a little too long.

01:16:37.072 --> 01:16:38.562
So, now what?

01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:42.768
Have you ever...

01:16:42.811 --> 01:16:44.574
No, l never, no.

01:16:45.614 --> 01:16:47.741
l don't know why l asked that.

01:16:47.783 --> 01:16:49.580
l don't even know why
l asked about birth control.

01:16:49.618 --> 01:16:52.485
Most guys wouldn't care
if you had it or not.

01:16:52.521 --> 01:16:56.457
That's why l like you.
There'll be other times.

01:16:56.492 --> 01:16:59.017
lt'll probably be
a long time from now.

01:17:04.533 --> 01:17:07.195
Sorry, Kid.

01:17:07.236 --> 01:17:11.297
That's what they call me.
"Sorry Kid."

01:17:13.709 --> 01:17:15.734
That's not what l call you.

01:17:23.719 --> 01:17:25.016
Get out of the way!

01:17:30.859 --> 01:17:32.087
What are you doing?

01:17:32.127 --> 01:17:34.027
l'm supposed to be
in my bedclothes.

01:17:34.063 --> 01:17:35.860
l don't know
whether to watch or run.

01:17:35.898 --> 01:17:37.331
Hurry up.

01:17:37.366 --> 01:17:41.302
l don't know how those hoodlums
got into the party.

01:17:41.337 --> 01:17:42.895
You should've pressed charges.

01:17:42.938 --> 01:17:45.372
Not with those
fascist cops there.

01:17:45.407 --> 01:17:47.341
lf l'd met that hoodlum
in the street, man to boy...

01:17:47.376 --> 01:17:49.901
l'd punch him
in his snot locker.

01:17:49.945 --> 01:17:53.437
You know l don't like
to be sucker-punched.

01:17:53.482 --> 01:17:55.814
You've tried it
a couple of times.

01:17:59.722 --> 01:18:02.156
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

01:18:02.191 --> 01:18:05.251
-How am l supposed to get out?
-Back door!

01:18:26.515 --> 01:18:27.743
Mama?

01:18:27.783 --> 01:18:30.581
Sidney, you're awake.

01:18:33.889 --> 01:18:36.585
l decided to stay home
after all.

01:18:36.625 --> 01:18:39.116
That's my little baby.

01:18:39.161 --> 01:18:43.257
Our little pumpkin
stayed home all by herself.

01:18:55.344 --> 01:18:57.278
-ls that Princess?
-l'll see.

01:18:59.214 --> 01:19:01.341
lt's probably nothing.
See? lt stopped.

01:19:03.318 --> 01:19:05.786
l'm sleepy.
l'm going to go to bed now.

01:19:13.429 --> 01:19:15.761
My back!

01:19:15.798 --> 01:19:17.766
Those cops are always
fucking with--

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:19.893
My stomach.

01:19:19.935 --> 01:19:22.597
Shut up.
He hit us all the same way.

01:19:22.638 --> 01:19:25.698
l'm tired of gettin'
beat by punk cops, man.

01:19:25.741 --> 01:19:28.266
Pee-Wee,
how does your ribs feel?

01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:30.870
They fucked me up the same way
they fucked you up.

01:19:30.913 --> 01:19:32.744
Yo, look!

01:19:32.781 --> 01:19:35.113
Oh, yeah.

01:19:35.150 --> 01:19:37.243
After gettin'
beat down by them cops...

01:19:37.286 --> 01:19:39.186
l'm ready to whip
somebody's ass.

01:19:39.221 --> 01:19:41.155
Where you goin', longhair?
Come here!

01:19:45.694 --> 01:19:47.559
Let "Hey Love..."

01:19:47.596 --> 01:19:49.120
Oh, my God!

01:19:49.164 --> 01:19:51.632
The classic sounds of sexy soul.

01:19:51.667 --> 01:19:54.431
Look at my hand again,
you'll be like that man...

01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:57.598
Get some chicken, baby!

01:19:57.639 --> 01:20:01.541
There goes
that broomhead albino!

01:20:01.577 --> 01:20:06.480
Get that motherfucker now!
Get him now!

01:20:09.651 --> 01:20:13.109
Get him ! Come on!

01:20:13.155 --> 01:20:15.487
Fuckin' rat!

01:20:15.524 --> 01:20:17.253
Get off me, man!

01:20:18.293 --> 01:20:21.228
Oh, shit!

01:20:21.263 --> 01:20:22.423
Come on.

01:20:30.839 --> 01:20:32.500
What happened to homey's shoe?

01:20:45.554 --> 01:20:46.782
Freeze!

01:20:51.527 --> 01:20:56.931
Aw, shit! Shit!

01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:59.867
Who's gonna explain that?

01:21:19.988 --> 01:21:21.979
What the fuck you lookin' at?

01:21:25.761 --> 01:21:30.892
So this is how you got
that Buckwheat fade.

01:21:30.933 --> 01:21:33.561
You stick your head
in the icebox, right?

01:21:33.602 --> 01:21:35.399
l hear you're a rapper.

01:21:35.437 --> 01:21:37.564
l got a rap for your ass.

01:21:37.606 --> 01:21:40.268
You run around town
like a faggot in heat

01:21:40.309 --> 01:21:42.277
Me and my boys can't be beat

01:21:42.311 --> 01:21:44.871
Wherever you go,
we can smell you like gas

01:21:44.913 --> 01:21:47.609
And we're gonna kick
your fuckin' ass

01:21:47.649 --> 01:21:50.516
You got your silly ass
locked in the icebox

01:21:50.552 --> 01:21:52.850
With nowhere to go

01:21:52.888 --> 01:21:55.379
What we should really do
is take this refrigerator...

01:21:55.424 --> 01:21:56.948
and just dump that shit
in the river.

01:21:56.992 --> 01:21:59.153
You ain't thinkin'.
Where's your head at?

01:21:59.194 --> 01:22:00.752
Leave me the fuck alone.

01:22:00.796 --> 01:22:02.423
Freeze, Negroes.

01:22:02.464 --> 01:22:04.398
Hey, let me out!

01:22:04.433 --> 01:22:06.924
This is your lucky day.

01:22:07.135 --> 01:22:10.593
lt was a jammin' party.

01:22:10.639 --> 01:22:13.733
There you go, there you go.

01:22:13.775 --> 01:22:16.801
-l got to talk to you.
-Tell me tomorrow.

01:22:16.845 --> 01:22:19.712
l'm sorry, Ev.

01:22:19.748 --> 01:22:23.081
The brothers
keep fucking with me.

01:22:23.118 --> 01:22:26.246
You were real cool with me.
Always remember that.

01:22:26.288 --> 01:22:27.482
But Kid's dad--

01:22:27.522 --> 01:22:30.457
What the hell happened to Kid?
He was supposed to help.

01:22:30.492 --> 01:22:31.857
l thought he was down.

01:22:31.893 --> 01:22:33.326
Peace out.

01:23:09.197 --> 01:23:10.892
Yo, move over, man.

01:23:13.702 --> 01:23:15.033
Move! Move!

01:23:25.213 --> 01:23:27.704
We've been
going at this all day...

01:23:27.749 --> 01:23:29.273
since earlier in the lunchroom.

01:23:29.318 --> 01:23:31.183
lt hasn't gotten us
anywhere but in here...

01:23:31.219 --> 01:23:32.550
which is where
we don't want to be.

01:23:32.587 --> 01:23:35.021
Why don't we let
bygones be bygones...

01:23:35.057 --> 01:23:38.515
and work together
to get out of here?

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:39.891
What do you say?

01:23:41.196 --> 01:23:43.494
Man, fuck you.

01:23:48.103 --> 01:23:51.698
Looks like l'm in here
for a couple of more days.

01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:53.708
So how's everything
out on the street?

01:23:53.742 --> 01:23:56.176
You taking care of my business?

01:24:00.782 --> 01:24:01.840
What the--

01:24:01.883 --> 01:24:04.579
l know the party's not over yet.

01:24:04.619 --> 01:24:05.984
Think so?

01:24:08.890 --> 01:24:10.414
That was wrong.

01:24:13.228 --> 01:24:15.196
Play in full effect.
What up?

01:24:15.230 --> 01:24:17.755
Play, this is Kid.
l'm in prison.

01:24:17.799 --> 01:24:19.323
Right, at your house.

01:24:19.368 --> 01:24:22.030
No, l'm not at home.
l'm in jail for real.

01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:24.971
l need you to bail me out.
Anybody there to borrow from?

01:24:25.006 --> 01:24:27.304
Just Bilal,
packing up his equipment.

01:24:27.342 --> 01:24:29.105
Brothers ain't got no money.

01:24:29.144 --> 01:24:31.874
Hurry, man.
My back's against the wall.

01:24:31.913 --> 01:24:35.713
Just give me a minute.
We'll be right there.

01:24:35.751 --> 01:24:37.742
Just do me a favor.
Don't pick up the soap.

01:24:37.786 --> 01:24:40.084
Like l need you to tell me that.

01:24:40.122 --> 01:24:42.090
That's why you can't
be on C.P.T.

01:24:42.124 --> 01:24:44.718
l need you
on Japanese people time.

01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:46.785
l'm depending on you.
Are you gonna come down?

01:24:46.828 --> 01:24:48.125
-All right.
-l'm serious.

01:24:48.163 --> 01:24:49.596
All right!

01:24:49.631 --> 01:24:50.791
All right, bye.

01:25:01.042 --> 01:25:02.669
-How much we got?
-What?

01:25:02.711 --> 01:25:04.042
How much do we have?

01:25:04.079 --> 01:25:07.071
Don't holler at me, man.
l'm telling you.

01:25:08.483 --> 01:25:10.348
Think they'll take a check?

01:25:10.385 --> 01:25:14.082
Shit. l got to collect
from the bums at my party.

01:25:14.122 --> 01:25:17.751
Think they'll give you money
after you kicked them out?

01:25:17.793 --> 01:25:21.490
lt's the least they can do
after breaking my toilet.

01:25:21.530 --> 01:25:24.988
How about the girls
who left earlier with Kid?

01:25:35.677 --> 01:25:36.974
Boy, are you crazy?

01:25:37.012 --> 01:25:39.572
Kid's in jail.
We need your help.

01:25:39.614 --> 01:25:41.673
-Jail?
-Yeah.

01:25:41.716 --> 01:25:43.684
l should get in trouble
'cause he did?

01:25:43.718 --> 01:25:45.185
He didn't do nothing wrong.

01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:48.280
We're his friends.
All we need is bail money.

01:25:48.323 --> 01:25:51.315
Bail money? He got a daddy.

01:25:51.359 --> 01:25:52.986
His daddy'll kick his ass.

01:25:53.028 --> 01:25:56.122
Should've thought of that
before he did what he did.

01:25:56.164 --> 01:25:59.497
He is my boy and all, but damn.

01:26:10.545 --> 01:26:12.672
Shit!

01:26:23.291 --> 01:26:25.350
Why you try and leave me?

01:26:25.393 --> 01:26:26.519
l saw you running like hell.

01:26:26.561 --> 01:26:28.859
No sense of both of us
getting our asses kicked.

01:26:28.897 --> 01:26:30.660
Man, that's fucked up.

01:26:30.699 --> 01:26:32.860
-Did you get the money?
-No. She trippin'.

01:26:32.901 --> 01:26:36.166
That's the problem when l send
a boy to do a man's job.

01:26:36.204 --> 01:26:40.368
A boy?
Think you can do any better?

01:26:42.477 --> 01:26:45.378
Look, nigger, l--Hi, Play.

01:26:45.413 --> 01:26:48.541
Hi. l know you ain't in bed.

01:26:48.583 --> 01:26:50.346
The party ain't over yet.

01:26:50.385 --> 01:26:52.376
After we go get Kid,
we're going to Burger King.

01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:54.388
Burger King?

01:26:54.422 --> 01:26:56.583
A little bite to eat.
Hang out a little while.

01:26:56.625 --> 01:26:58.217
lt's kind of late.

01:26:58.260 --> 01:27:00.228
Come on, for me.

01:27:02.864 --> 01:27:04.092
Wait out front.

01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:07.063
Don't forget your purse.

01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:09.396
Hey, Daisy.

01:27:09.437 --> 01:27:12.668
Heard you got quite
a reputation at your school.

01:27:12.707 --> 01:27:13.867
Sweetest meat around.

01:27:13.909 --> 01:27:17.572
When we get finished,
you gonna be even sweeter.

01:27:17.612 --> 01:27:21.912
Know what this man did?
Tell him, Hatchett.

01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:25.477
l cut a man's heart out.

01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:27.181
Check that out.

01:27:27.222 --> 01:27:29.190
Tell him what you did, Rock.

01:27:29.224 --> 01:27:32.990
l beat a police sergeant,
with his own club.

01:27:33.028 --> 01:27:35.019
And didn't run after he did it.

01:27:35.063 --> 01:27:37.031
Hell, no.

01:27:37.065 --> 01:27:38.794
What did you do?

01:27:38.833 --> 01:27:41.563
l used to run
a day-care center.

01:27:42.604 --> 01:27:45.095
l called Sidney.
She wants to come with us.

01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:46.573
l told her we'd pick her up.

01:27:46.608 --> 01:27:51.011
You got a couple of girlfriends
l can meet?

01:27:51.046 --> 01:27:53.913
Has anybody ever told you
your breath stinks?

01:27:53.949 --> 01:27:55.246
Damn!

01:27:55.283 --> 01:27:57.308
-Fuck you!
-What?

01:27:57.352 --> 01:27:58.546
You heard. Fuck you!

01:27:58.587 --> 01:28:00.248
You mad 'cause
you still a virgin.

01:28:00.288 --> 01:28:02.256
l ain't no virgin.
l got a girlfriend.

01:28:02.290 --> 01:28:04.349
She just don't live
around here, right?

01:28:04.392 --> 01:28:05.654
Dragon-breath.

01:28:05.694 --> 01:28:07.628
Hey, don't hit me.

01:28:07.662 --> 01:28:09.129
You got dragon-breath.

01:28:09.164 --> 01:28:11.189
Your shit is a little tart, too.

01:28:11.232 --> 01:28:12.358
Nigger, please.

01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.391
-Belch.
-Shut up.

01:28:14.436 --> 01:28:16.097
That's what l thought.

01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:35.248
l got something to tell you.

01:28:35.290 --> 01:28:36.587
-You got juice?
-Yes.

01:28:36.625 --> 01:28:37.887
Tell me.

01:28:39.995 --> 01:28:41.292
This l know.

01:28:43.898 --> 01:28:45.195
l don't believe you.

01:28:45.233 --> 01:28:47.428
What?

01:28:51.272 --> 01:28:53.297
That's right. So don't get mad.

01:28:55.577 --> 01:28:57.010
l ain't trippin'.

01:28:58.480 --> 01:28:59.777
You go, girl.

01:28:59.814 --> 01:29:01.247
Thank you, girl.

01:29:03.251 --> 01:29:07.881
Did l tell you how good
you looked in that suit?

01:29:16.898 --> 01:29:19.833
Don't worry.
Won't take but a minute.

01:29:19.868 --> 01:29:21.859
Depending on who's in it.

01:29:26.207 --> 01:29:29.176
ls there anything
l can do to stop this?

01:29:29.210 --> 01:29:32.407
Richard Pryor said
when he was in prison...

01:29:32.447 --> 01:29:35.678
he kept folks laughing to keep
their minds off his booty.

01:29:35.717 --> 01:29:38.652
Do you know any jokes?

01:29:38.687 --> 01:29:41.281
No, l don't know any jokes.

01:29:41.322 --> 01:29:42.949
You better think of something.

01:29:42.991 --> 01:29:45.687
What if l can't
think of anything?

01:29:47.128 --> 01:29:49.392
The light's out,
the party's over...

01:29:49.431 --> 01:29:52.662
the cake's on the griddle,
and you already greased.

01:29:54.903 --> 01:29:57.030
All right,
you're first, my man.

01:29:57.072 --> 01:29:58.801
Let's go.

01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:02.367
All right. Let's go.

01:30:02.410 --> 01:30:03.741
Come on.

01:30:03.778 --> 01:30:05.040
Excuse me, everybody.

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:07.514
Won't you gather around?
l got something to say.

01:30:07.549 --> 01:30:09.016
Who is this clown?

01:30:09.050 --> 01:30:10.574
Just a guy who looks
at things differently

01:30:10.618 --> 01:30:13.178
The way things are
aren't how they're meant to be

01:30:13.221 --> 01:30:15.212
With the big men
here in the bullpen

01:30:15.256 --> 01:30:17.690
l don't want my knees
to take a full bend

01:30:17.726 --> 01:30:19.853
Step back, ask yourself,
can it wait?

01:30:19.894 --> 01:30:21.885
Or do you want to become
an AlDS candidate?

01:30:21.930 --> 01:30:24.330
Take your eyes off me,
don't even watch the Kid

01:30:24.365 --> 01:30:26.697
Or you'll go out
like Liberace did

01:30:26.735 --> 01:30:28.760
ln my own cell
l could've been alone

01:30:28.803 --> 01:30:31.203
Why do you all want me?
l'm only skin and bones

01:30:31.239 --> 01:30:33.799
l'm feeling faint,
it's kind of hot

01:30:33.842 --> 01:30:36.310
My, what big muscles you got

01:30:36.344 --> 01:30:38.278
Hoo, lips don't fail me now

01:30:38.313 --> 01:30:39.746
Until Play comes to bail me out

01:30:39.781 --> 01:30:40.975
What's going on there?

01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:51.320
Man, this is too much,
look but don't touch

01:30:51.359 --> 01:30:53.554
l'm just trying
to avoid the bum rush

01:30:53.595 --> 01:30:56.063
Thought l was in here
with murderers and stranglers

01:30:56.097 --> 01:30:58.122
You guys are a bunch
of rump wranglers

01:30:58.166 --> 01:31:00.157
And why me?
Look, l'm not the only male

01:31:00.201 --> 01:31:02.499
We gonna tie that fade
into a ponytail

01:31:02.537 --> 01:31:05.097
Yo, this is a no-go,
l'm gonna call the C.O.

01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:06.971
Me a homo?
Nah, man, that's a no-no

01:31:07.008 --> 01:31:09.238
But if you back off now,
that might save you time

01:31:09.277 --> 01:31:11.108
Off your sentence
for good behavior

01:31:11.146 --> 01:31:13.637
l'm speaking from the heart,
from the center

01:31:13.681 --> 01:31:15.740
The sign on my ass
says "Do Not Enter"

01:31:15.784 --> 01:31:18.617
l'm a rapper, l rock rhymes,
so l'm gonna bust one

01:31:18.653 --> 01:31:20.484
l see y'all wanna rock,
like Hudson

01:31:20.522 --> 01:31:22.422
Just an example,
l chill 'em and thrill 'em

01:31:22.457 --> 01:31:24.425
Where is Play?
l'm gonna kill him

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:28.121
Songbird,
you hit the right note.

01:31:28.163 --> 01:31:29.357
You just made bail.

01:31:33.301 --> 01:31:34.859
Ha, hey, fellas, fellas

01:31:34.903 --> 01:31:37.337
Ha ha, l gotta go,
all right?

01:31:37.372 --> 01:31:39.101
Don't feel bad, all right?

01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:41.438
Hey, no long faces, ha ha

01:31:41.476 --> 01:31:42.943
Think of all the fun we had

01:31:42.977 --> 01:31:45.502
l want to thank y'all
for making me feel welcome

01:31:45.547 --> 01:31:48.675
lt really, really
did the trick, all right?

01:31:48.716 --> 01:31:50.240
Oh, uh, by the way

01:31:51.386 --> 01:31:52.546
Suck my dick

01:31:55.824 --> 01:31:57.621
l'll kick your fuckin' ass!

01:31:57.659 --> 01:31:58.819
Punk!

01:32:37.732 --> 01:32:41.259
With that motivation,
you could have rapped all night.

01:32:41.302 --> 01:32:43.702
l'm glad y'all came
through for me finally.

01:32:43.738 --> 01:32:46.036
Would l let a homeboy down?

01:32:51.246 --> 01:32:55.205
So, you want
to go out next week?

01:32:55.250 --> 01:32:57.980
-OK.
-Good.

01:32:59.754 --> 01:33:02.086
-Call me.
-l will.

01:33:03.191 --> 01:33:05.716
l don't get a kiss?

01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:08.752
A hug? Some form of affection?

01:33:11.499 --> 01:33:13.797
Come on, stop playing.

01:33:26.848 --> 01:33:29.783
Any lipstick on me? Yes!

01:33:29.817 --> 01:33:31.842
l knew it. Smooth operator.

01:33:42.497 --> 01:33:43.657
Bye, Sidney.

01:34:00.014 --> 01:34:03.177
Don't slob too loud.
You'll wake the neighbors up.

01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:13.950
l'll see you later.

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:34.871
This has been your night, boy!

01:34:34.916 --> 01:34:37.214
Cannot front. You are the dude.

01:34:37.251 --> 01:34:40.015
That must have been
one hell of a walk home.

01:34:40.054 --> 01:34:42.386
Give me
a play-by-play description.

01:34:42.423 --> 01:34:43.947
What color were the panties?

01:34:45.126 --> 01:34:48.459
We got into it,
but then we didn't--

01:34:48.496 --> 01:34:50.327
She was on her period?

01:34:50.365 --> 01:34:52.629
No, she wasn't on her period.

01:34:52.667 --> 01:34:53.895
What's up?

01:34:55.303 --> 01:34:57.066
l didn't have any rubbers.

01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:02.837
Hold up. She was down.

01:35:02.877 --> 01:35:04.868
Play knows these things.
She was down.

01:35:04.912 --> 01:35:07.244
And you was down,
and you didn't...

01:35:07.281 --> 01:35:09.181
'cause you didn't
have birth control?

01:35:09.217 --> 01:35:11.378
Let me explain--

01:35:11.419 --> 01:35:14.047
We're talking
about fine Sidney here.

01:35:14.088 --> 01:35:15.919
Good hair.

01:35:15.957 --> 01:35:17.754
Def body!

01:35:17.792 --> 01:35:19.453
That's who
we're talking about.

01:35:19.494 --> 01:35:21.587
ls that all you're into?
"Good hair. Def body."

01:35:21.629 --> 01:35:25.531
What are you talking about?
l look at the face, too.

01:35:25.566 --> 01:35:26.828
That's fucked.

01:35:26.868 --> 01:35:29.302
l'm not about
having babies right now.

01:35:29.337 --> 01:35:31.328
That's her problem.

01:35:31.372 --> 01:35:32.964
You the man.

01:35:33.007 --> 01:35:36.534
She takes care of that
or pays the price.

01:35:36.577 --> 01:35:38.568
-How can you say that?
-You're naive.

01:35:38.613 --> 01:35:41.081
You're a fuckin' dog,
and you, too, Rover.

01:35:41.115 --> 01:35:44.175
Yeah, l'm a dog.

01:35:44.218 --> 01:35:46.345
You sound like your pops.

01:35:46.387 --> 01:35:48.480
A guy your age
shouldn't sound like your pops.

01:35:48.523 --> 01:35:49.854
You've got a problem.

01:35:57.665 --> 01:36:00.133
Yo, Kid.
Chill for a minute.

01:36:00.168 --> 01:36:03.160
lt's still early,
l got the crib...

01:36:03.204 --> 01:36:05.695
and you won't believe
what's on the Late Show.

01:36:05.740 --> 01:36:07.401
"Krush Groove"
and "Beat Street."

01:36:07.442 --> 01:36:09.808
Shit, let's go to your house now
and watch it.

01:36:13.214 --> 01:36:15.273
l really would like
to see the movie...

01:36:15.316 --> 01:36:17.443
but it's really late, man.

01:36:17.485 --> 01:36:19.146
Tape it,
and we'll watch it tomorrow.

01:36:19.187 --> 01:36:21.314
Peace out.

01:36:21.355 --> 01:36:23.755
-Peace, boy.
-Peace.

01:36:25.526 --> 01:36:28.359
You know what l love
was "Breakin'."

01:36:28.396 --> 01:36:30.728
l wonder when
that shit's coming on.

01:37:35.129 --> 01:37:37.461
l wouldn't do that just yet...

01:37:38.699 --> 01:37:41.224
'cause your ass is mine.

01:37:41.802 --> 01:37:43.167
Pop, l can explain.

01:37:43.204 --> 01:37:45.798
l'm gonna whup that damn
high-top fade off of you!

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:47.364
l'm sick of your shit!

01:37:47.408 --> 01:37:50.309
l work too hard and too long
to let you run over me...

01:37:50.344 --> 01:37:52.642
like you outta your damn mind.

01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:54.739
l walked across
this damn city...

01:37:54.782 --> 01:37:56.909
got stopped by
the goddamn law...

01:37:56.951 --> 01:37:58.782
lookin' for your monkey ass.

01:37:58.819 --> 01:38:01.344
All you kids over there
just slow-dancing...

01:38:01.389 --> 01:38:04.187
doing the grind,
and the peepin' and the hidin'.

01:38:04.225 --> 01:38:07.991
l know your ass.
You was there, wasn't you?

01:38:08.029 --> 01:38:10.259
l run the show here.

01:38:10.298 --> 01:38:13.267
l wear the pants and the apron,
and l'll wear your ass out!

01:38:17.672 --> 01:38:19.230
l'm gonna whup you
till l'm sleepy.

01:38:19.273 --> 01:38:22.242
And l'm wide awoke
'cause l just woke up.

01:38:22.276 --> 01:38:24.107
You think because
you're big and yellow...

01:38:24.145 --> 01:38:26.636
l'm supposed to be mellow.
Hell, no!

01:38:26.681 --> 01:38:29.275
l'll start a fight
in an empty room !

01:38:29.317 --> 01:38:31.911
You can call Child Abuse
if you want to!

01:38:31.953 --> 01:38:34.979
They better not come in here,
'cause l'll kick their ass, too.

01:38:38.593 --> 01:38:40.993
l'm gonna give you
a whuppin' from now on.

01:38:41.028 --> 01:38:42.825
l'll whup the cowboy shit
out from you.

01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:48.633
Gee, Pop.

01:38:48.669 --> 01:38:50.432
Now get your ass to bed!

01:38:50.471 --> 01:38:52.803
And don't wake up
till l tell you to!

01:39:11.459 --> 01:39:12.687
l didn't mean it.

01:39:12.727 --> 01:39:15.958
l didn't know they were
the rest of the cookies.

01:39:15.997 --> 01:39:17.692
My grandma's 87 years old.

01:39:17.732 --> 01:39:20.929
l don't know how many years
she's got left to make cookies.

01:39:20.968 --> 01:39:23.095
You didn't have to finish
the rest of them.

01:39:23.137 --> 01:39:25.970
l don't know how many years
l've got left in my grandmother.

01:39:26.007 --> 01:39:27.338
They were good, though.

01:39:30.444 --> 01:39:32.344
Look at that.
