00:12.482 --> 00:16.693
- Coach, is this what l think it is?
- What do you think it is?

00:16.862 --> 00:21.938
l think it's something totally useless that
some salesman talked you into buying.

00:22.116 --> 00:24.358
Boy, you're good at thinking, Sam.

00:25.495 --> 00:28.366
''The Billiard Buddy Pool Table Adapter.''

00:28.540 --> 00:30.579
Yeah, but it's not useless, Sam.

00:30.749 --> 00:36.623
You can make it into a Ping-Pong table,
a knock hockey table, a salad bar.

00:36.798 --> 00:39.171
- How much?
- l don't know.

00:39.343 --> 00:41.382
A buck and a half with croutons.

00:41.553 --> 00:46.512
No, Coach,
l mean how much for the whole thing?

00:46.684 --> 00:52.852
600 bucks, Sam, but the salesman said,
''Satisfaction guaranteed.''

00:53.023 --> 00:56.523
- Or?
- That would have been a good question.

00:59.989 --> 01:02.028
$600?

01:02.199 --> 01:05.069
Yeah, hard to believe, isn't it?

02:23.075 --> 02:25.281
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

02:26.369 --> 02:29.075
- What'll it be?
- The usual.

02:29.248 --> 02:32.035
l'll have a trough of beer and a snorkel.

02:35.087 --> 02:37.329
Cliffie, maybe you could help me out.

02:37.506 --> 02:40.423
- My mother-in-law's in town.
- Sorry.

02:40.592 --> 02:44.970
- She wants to go sightseeing.
- Tell her to go to Florida.

02:46.850 --> 02:52.805
l told her to go further south than that,
but she's interested in American history.

02:52.981 --> 02:56.148
Norman, take your mother
to see Bunker Hill.

02:56.318 --> 02:59.105
- Where?
- Bunker Hill.

02:59.279 --> 03:04.071
The scene of one of the most important
battles in American history.

03:04.242 --> 03:08.370
That place l've got to go all the way
around to get to the pizza parlour?

03:08.538 --> 03:11.112
No way.

03:11.291 --> 03:13.331
Hey, Norm, your car's unlocked.

03:13.502 --> 03:17.036
- Someone might steal your laundry.
- What laundry?

03:17.214 --> 03:19.622
That big bundle on the front seat.

03:19.801 --> 03:23.085
That's my mother-in-law.
She had kind of a rough flight.

03:23.261 --> 03:26.548
She nodded out the second
she hit the upholstery.

03:26.724 --> 03:30.424
And you left her out there
in an unattended automobile?

03:30.603 --> 03:34.850
l threw a blanket over her and l left her
a note in case she comes to.

03:36.191 --> 03:39.312
She's lucky to have you
as a son-in-law, Norman.

03:39.487 --> 03:44.066
l give her the red-carpet treatment,
l guess. Hey, pal.

03:44.242 --> 03:48.536
Could you do me a favour and toss
these in the blue Civic out in front?

03:55.212 --> 03:58.830
- ls Sam Malone here?
- No. What can l buy from you?

03:59.008 --> 04:01.676
What am l saying? What can l get you?

04:01.843 --> 04:03.884
l'll have a beer.

04:04.054 --> 04:06.462
My name is Lenny Barnes.

04:06.640 --> 04:11.800
l'm the publicist for the charity softball
game this Saturday. l'm looking for Sam.

04:11.978 --> 04:15.478
l can tell you right now.
He wouldn't be interested in that.

04:15.650 --> 04:20.440
Nobody with any dignity wants to get
into those sideshow carnival things,

04:20.612 --> 04:23.317
where everybody's made to look stupid.

04:23.491 --> 04:27.952
- Aren't you Ernie Pantusso?
- l'd be honoured to do it.

04:28.121 --> 04:31.870
- l don't think we need anybody else.
- Oh, well.

04:32.041 --> 04:35.540
l find it hard to get up to
Fenway these days.

04:35.711 --> 04:37.752
The old memories come back?

04:37.922 --> 04:42.300
No, l keep getting the wrong bus.
l must have an old schedule.

04:42.469 --> 04:46.135
l guess those stories about you are true.

04:46.307 --> 04:48.761
That they are, Lenny.

04:48.934 --> 04:53.726
Mr Barnes, Coach is right. Sam never
plays in old-timer type games.

04:53.897 --> 04:56.899
- Sam's already agreed to play.
- What?

04:57.067 --> 04:59.392
l'm here for some publicity shots.

04:59.570 --> 05:03.318
Lenny, why don't you take your beer
and have a seat and wait for Sam?

05:03.490 --> 05:07.404
- Thank you. l have to make a call.
- Use the telephone.

05:12.291 --> 05:15.079
l'm so surprised at Sam, Diane.

05:15.253 --> 05:19.962
He always said to me he'd never
get involved in one of these things.

05:21.050 --> 05:27.587
Maybe Sam misses being out there on
the baseball field standing on the bump.

05:27.766 --> 05:31.680
You got a point there. l miss
seeing him out there on the bump, too,

05:31.853 --> 05:34.226
but incidentally, it's called a mound.

05:35.315 --> 05:38.814
Unless we're not talking about
the same thing.

05:39.945 --> 05:42.731
Thank you, Carla, for helping me.

05:42.906 --> 05:46.240
You're sure you want to quit?
l'm willing to catch a few more.

05:46.410 --> 05:49.614
You weren't toying
with the sound barrier out there.

05:49.789 --> 05:53.038
No, l just wanted to loosen
up a little bit, that's all.

05:53.208 --> 05:58.630
l don't think you should be engaging in
strenuous activity when you're with child.

05:58.798 --> 06:03.294
lf l didn't do things with child,
l'd never leave the house.

06:03.469 --> 06:07.514
The only thing l ever did without child
resulted in one.

06:07.681 --> 06:10.352
You're playing in this charity game?

06:10.518 --> 06:13.520
Yeah. l was out there warming up.
My arm feels good.

06:13.688 --> 06:15.727
Are you kidding me?

06:15.899 --> 06:20.062
When a butterfly lands on a ball
in mid-flight, it's not cooking.

06:21.529 --> 06:24.530
All l care about
is not embarrassing myself.

06:24.699 --> 06:27.321
- Good luck.
- l have a right to be a little rusty.

06:27.494 --> 06:32.322
The only thing l've thrown in the past
ten years is Diane's butt out of here.

06:35.752 --> 06:41.505
No, you are thinking of the tantrums
you threw when l walked out of here.

06:42.719 --> 06:46.419
The only thing l enjoy hearing
more than you two argue

06:46.597 --> 06:48.839
is hearing Cliff talk about Florida.

06:49.016 --> 06:53.725
l was just about to tell Normie here
that Florida is a pollution-free state.

06:53.896 --> 06:56.139
You know how they treat solid waste?

06:56.315 --> 06:58.937
You said they treated you very well.

07:04.657 --> 07:07.113
- Hey, Sam.
- Lenny, how are you doing?

07:07.285 --> 07:09.989
l'm fine.
l arranged to have a photographer

07:10.162 --> 07:13.413
and your opponents
drop by for publicity stills.

07:13.583 --> 07:17.581
- Right now?
- They should be here right away.

07:17.754 --> 07:22.712
What brought about this sudden
altruistic bent in your personality?

07:22.884 --> 07:28.508
l resent that. l've always cared deeply
for people less fortunate than myself.

07:28.681 --> 07:30.889
Here they are.

07:34.814 --> 07:39.190
Sam, you great big humanitarian.

07:40.945 --> 07:45.940
Who says you can't work for a worthy
cause and still be sexually aroused?

07:46.117 --> 07:49.985
You could be having an appendectomy
and still be sexually aroused.

07:50.163 --> 07:53.863
Be that as it may.
l have to excuse myself now

07:54.042 --> 07:57.458
and go say hello
to my fellow do-gooders.

08:04.803 --> 08:08.551
- Are those dames or what?
- This is disgusting.

08:09.642 --> 08:13.889
ln what kind of culture do l live
where they are the ideal woman?

08:14.063 --> 08:16.850
You've got admit they are beautiful.

08:17.024 --> 08:19.811
Coach, take away all their make-up,

08:19.986 --> 08:24.694
all their expensive haircuts and those
bodies and what have you got?

08:24.865 --> 08:26.941
You.

08:32.164 --> 08:36.410
- Hey, they're Playboy Playmates.
- Get out of here.

08:36.585 --> 08:40.285
l recognise Miss February
of a few years back.

08:40.465 --> 08:44.462
She's a native of Montana, hates
the hustle and bustle of the big city.

08:44.636 --> 08:47.423
Her turn-ons include strong
but sensitive men,

08:47.597 --> 08:50.681
classical music and rainy afternoons.

08:52.560 --> 08:56.476
Hard to believe that Vera
and those are the same sex.

08:56.649 --> 09:00.562
Excuse me. Does anyone have a blue
Civic with a bumper sticker that says,

09:00.735 --> 09:05.481
- ''Accountants Do lt With lnterest''?
- That would be mine. lt's true.

09:05.657 --> 09:10.070
- They're towing it away.
- You noticed an old lady getting out?

09:11.122 --> 09:14.206
- No.
- Great. Another round, Coach.

09:14.375 --> 09:19.416
- What about your mother-in-law?
- She's safe. The cops have her.

09:21.382 --> 09:24.632
- So my place or yours?
- l have a roommate.

09:24.802 --> 09:26.842
Yours it is.

09:30.267 --> 09:34.810
- Would you take your drink?
- Are you upset about something?

09:34.980 --> 09:37.815
You know what bugs me
about women like you?

09:37.983 --> 09:41.683
You take off all your clothes,
you pose for a magazine,

09:41.861 --> 09:44.400
thousands of men see you naked.

09:44.573 --> 09:47.573
l have to go to them one by one.
lt's not fair.

09:48.826 --> 09:51.744
You look gorgeous, Sam.

09:51.913 --> 09:55.081
Get up there
and put your arms around the girls.

09:55.251 --> 09:58.168
Put my arms around them, you say?

10:02.048 --> 10:05.465
Squeeze in there real tight, Sam.
That's good.

10:05.636 --> 10:09.052
OK. Tell me, Sam, how do you feel
about the game on Saturday?

10:09.223 --> 10:11.216
lt's a challenge of a lifetime.

10:11.392 --> 10:16.433
We're looking at natural assets that will
play havoc with the strike zone.

10:17.314 --> 10:20.232
No, l'm looking forward to the game

10:20.401 --> 10:24.862
and l'm particularly looking forward
to the shower afterwards.

10:26.241 --> 10:30.190
Seriously, it will be a great game.
l hope that everybody comes out

10:30.370 --> 10:32.410
to support a worthy cause.

10:32.580 --> 10:37.409
Step down and let me get a shot of the
girls. Put them over here by the door.

10:37.586 --> 10:41.204
l know what you're thinking
and l don't care.

10:41.380 --> 10:44.797
lf you think l'm even concerned,
you are wrong.

10:45.760 --> 10:49.593
Your sortie into sordidness has no effect
on my emotions.

10:49.765 --> 10:54.308
You could make love to all five of those
women and l would feel nothing.

10:54.478 --> 10:56.518
As l'm sure would they.

10:59.233 --> 11:01.772
Let me introduce you to the girls.

11:01.944 --> 11:06.192
l'd like to show them the charity
l was involved with last year.

11:10.244 --> 11:13.115
You are a sand flea.

11:14.624 --> 11:16.747
That's the thanks l get?

11:27.721 --> 11:31.256
Hey, Coach,
what happened to our pool table?

11:31.433 --> 11:37.436
lt's still there, but thanks to our Billiard
Buddy Adaptor, it's more fun than ever.

11:37.606 --> 11:43.858
lt can be a knock hockey table,
a Ping-Pong table. You name it.

11:44.029 --> 11:45.904
l want a pool table.

11:46.074 --> 11:50.818
Let me get out my easy-to-follow
conversion instructions here.

11:56.667 --> 11:58.707
Tool kit.

11:59.837 --> 12:01.877
For moving...

12:04.384 --> 12:07.254
And that.

12:07.428 --> 12:10.549
- Coach, how long is this going to take?
- 20 minutes.

12:10.724 --> 12:15.681
- 20 minutes to put it together?
- No, to figure what the hell this is.

12:16.813 --> 12:19.980
- Forget it. l'll play Ping-Pong.
- God bless you.

12:26.990 --> 12:32.115
The play of the game was when Angela
had to reach back to catch that foul ball.

12:33.330 --> 12:35.453
That was a thing of beauty, Normie.

12:35.624 --> 12:42.041
The best one was Ginger bending down
to catch that grounder. l had to applaud.

12:42.214 --> 12:46.923
Let's not forget when Rosemary and
Ginger kind of bumped into each other.

12:51.265 --> 12:54.800
Either one of you manage to sneak
a peak at the scoreboard?

12:54.978 --> 12:57.017
There was a scoreboard?

12:57.188 --> 13:01.601
The final score was Sam's team seven,
Playmates zero.

13:01.777 --> 13:04.979
He was blowing those girls away.
lt was a massacre.

13:05.155 --> 13:10.611
l lost track of the final strike outs, but the
important thing is the twinkies lost.

13:19.544 --> 13:24.005
- Did you hear l got 1 8 strike outs?
- Sam, l counted 1 7.

13:24.174 --> 13:26.796
The ump was blind.
That ball cut the corner.

13:26.969 --> 13:29.720
Drinks are on me. We're celebrating.

13:29.888 --> 13:32.296
Sammy,
what happened to the Playmates?

13:32.474 --> 13:35.096
l thought they were coming here
after the game.

13:35.269 --> 13:39.480
They were. l guess they're sore losers.
What happened to sportsmanship?

13:39.648 --> 13:43.729
Maybe they were put off
by your victory laps.

13:43.902 --> 13:47.687
Come on, man. That was just a joke.

13:47.866 --> 13:52.860
That was a pretty good game, wasn't it?
l really had my stuff back.

13:53.037 --> 13:56.241
- Wasn't it supposed to be for fun?
- That's right.

13:56.416 --> 14:01.125
l had a great time.
Hey, guys, l really had my stuff.

14:01.297 --> 14:04.416
Magnificent, Sam.
Any chance the girls'll be by?

14:04.591 --> 14:06.999
Would you guys forget the girls here?

14:07.177 --> 14:10.262
l just won a game,
didn't let anybody pass first base

14:10.430 --> 14:14.429
and you're pretending
it is an ordinary day.

14:14.602 --> 14:16.641
Excuse me.

14:16.812 --> 14:19.268
l'm not an expert in the field of sports,

14:19.440 --> 14:23.568
but it's my impression that the fans paid
to see the little Playmates

14:23.736 --> 14:27.021
wiggling their heinies around the bases.

14:27.197 --> 14:30.069
You're the last person
l want to talk to today.

14:30.243 --> 14:32.650
You're not in the top five any day,

14:32.829 --> 14:37.289
but for your information, people paid
good money to watch Sam Malone pitch.

14:37.458 --> 14:40.032
l paid for heinies.

14:40.211 --> 14:45.454
Come on! People don't pay to watch
their baseball stars stink.

14:45.633 --> 14:48.587
They pay to watch them
relive their old glories.

14:48.762 --> 14:53.388
Sammy l was more thrilled than anybody
to see you out there flinging it again,

14:53.558 --> 14:58.304
but even l was a little embarrassed
when you put one in Babette's ear

14:58.481 --> 15:01.018
cos she was crowding the plate.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.647
Hey, the plate belongs to me.

15:03.819 --> 15:07.604
lf she can't stand the heat, she
shouldn't have crossed the baseline.

15:07.781 --> 15:11.483
- We're celebrating, guys.
- Sam, you knocked a girl down?

15:11.661 --> 15:15.360
No, Coach, l didn't knock a girl down.
l knocked a batter down.

15:15.539 --> 15:19.786
- She was halfway across the plate.
- Halfway across. She deserves it.

15:19.960 --> 15:23.626
- Let's celebrate.
- Yes, by all means. Let's celebrate.

15:23.798 --> 15:26.206
This is a major accomplishment, Sam.

15:26.385 --> 15:30.251
l think you're ready to take on
the Camp Fire Girls All-Stars.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.718
Way to go, Diane.

15:33.641 --> 15:36.263
You guys want to go out there now
and face me?

15:36.436 --> 15:42.356
Any of you. Get a bat. First person that
gets a hit off me, l'll give them the bar.

15:42.526 --> 15:47.816
Any takers? l thought that would
shut you up, you gutless wonders.

15:47.989 --> 15:52.652
Why don't you go over to the Playboy
Club and hang out with the losing team?

15:52.828 --> 15:57.158
Coach, l'm going to be
in the back room...alone.

16:03.047 --> 16:05.086
Good, Diane's here.

16:06.926 --> 16:10.627
Sam, you are an attractive man.
You have many friends.

16:10.805 --> 16:15.681
You have a lot going for you. But you
have one miserable character flaw.

16:15.852 --> 16:19.932
Gee, l wonder if l could coax you
into telling me what that is.

16:27.697 --> 16:31.232
You and l dated
for what seemed an eternity

16:31.410 --> 16:33.866
and l think l know you pretty well.

16:34.038 --> 16:38.285
You get into a contest
and you'd rather die than lose.

16:39.793 --> 16:46.128
l'm surmising, but a fear of losing drove
you to drink and ruined your career.

16:48.135 --> 16:51.634
l'll tell you something
and then l'd appreciate it if you leave.

16:51.805 --> 16:55.056
A little competitiveness
is a healthy thing.

16:56.143 --> 17:01.517
But you have more than a little
competitiveness. Sam, you're very sick.

17:05.319 --> 17:08.071
- l am not.
- Yes, you are and l can prove it.

17:08.240 --> 17:10.278
Why did you play this game?

17:10.449 --> 17:17.663
To impress a bevy of buxom Bunnies,
who now will never speak to you again.

17:17.833 --> 17:22.246
You wanted to beat them
more than you wanted to bed them.

17:23.463 --> 17:26.167
My God, l am sick.

17:30.345 --> 17:33.133
You're not sick. You just have a problem.

17:33.307 --> 17:36.592
l know. l've always had it.

17:38.437 --> 17:42.601
You approached games in this same
way when you were a child?

17:42.775 --> 17:48.231
Especially when l was a child.
My parents were kind of tough on me.

17:48.405 --> 17:53.613
l couldn't please them. lf l got a C
in school, they said, ''Why not a B?''

17:53.786 --> 17:57.487
- lf l got a B, ''Why didn't you get an A?''
- And if you got an A?

17:57.665 --> 17:59.623
Sorry.

18:02.379 --> 18:07.752
You know, in high school
once l pitched a two-hitter.

18:07.926 --> 18:11.793
All my dad could talk about
were the lousy two damn hits.

18:13.681 --> 18:15.509
Sam, this is wonderful.

18:15.684 --> 18:21.687
You're sharing an attempt to confront
the roots of your self-involvement.

18:22.774 --> 18:26.938
l had no idea
you could relate on this level.

18:27.112 --> 18:30.944
Yeah, it kind of feels good
to open up like this.

18:35.538 --> 18:41.540
When l was about six l made my dad
breakfast in bed on Father's Day.

18:41.710 --> 18:44.332
l was really proud of myself.

18:44.505 --> 18:50.626
All he could say was the eggs were
too dry and the toast was too light.

18:53.348 --> 18:56.384
Sam, l'm feeling a closeness to you now

18:56.559 --> 19:01.554
that compels me to share
a core feeling of my own,

19:01.731 --> 19:06.192
something which l have yet to make
privy to my analyst.

19:07.154 --> 19:09.193
lt happened my 1 7th summer...

19:09.364 --> 19:13.066
lf l'd made the toast any darker,
he would have said l burned it.

19:13.244 --> 19:16.161
l was brimming
with the innocence of youth...

19:16.330 --> 19:19.699
Everybody else would have said,
''That toast is fine.''

19:19.875 --> 19:22.662
Stop with the damn toast tragedy.

19:23.754 --> 19:28.831
- What's your problem?
- l'm trying to share something painful.

19:29.010 --> 19:33.304
- And you keep cutting me off.
- l was talking about my dad.

19:33.473 --> 19:38.100
l was going to tell you about the time
l stayed home from the prom.

19:39.228 --> 19:42.396
You interrupted my dad's story for that?

19:42.566 --> 19:45.520
What more was there?
He didn't like your toast.

19:46.611 --> 19:49.398
Fine. Tell me all about your dance story.

19:49.572 --> 19:53.950
Does this have anything to do
with mice and glass slippers?

19:55.621 --> 20:01.410
l assure you my prom story would make
your story look like self-pitying tripe.

20:01.585 --> 20:06.579
All right. Right now l'm going to admit
that l'm a very competitive person.

20:06.757 --> 20:10.126
lt just occurred to me
why our relationship never worked.

20:10.303 --> 20:12.341
You always had to have the last say.

20:12.512 --> 20:14.969
You had to be on top
and you're still doing it.

20:15.141 --> 20:17.762
You are just as competitive as l am.

20:18.852 --> 20:23.313
Me? l'm not competitive.

20:25.151 --> 20:29.149
l'm intense and strong-willed.

20:29.322 --> 20:34.115
But l think
that mindless games and contests

20:34.286 --> 20:37.784
are very destructive
and diminish the human spirit.

20:37.955 --> 20:40.826
ls that right? Want to play Ping-Pong?

20:45.172 --> 20:48.672
Of course l don't want to play
Ping-Pong. lt's preposterous.

20:48.843 --> 20:50.881
lt's not exactly my best sport.

20:51.052 --> 20:55.133
A lot of people beat me at it,
but l bet l could beat you.

20:55.307 --> 20:57.346
What if you did? What would it prove?

20:57.519 --> 21:00.139
That l'm having a great day,
my dad was wrong,

21:00.312 --> 21:02.851
God's in His heaven and you are a loser.

21:05.776 --> 21:11.019
As always, you are just trying
to avoid the central issue here.

21:12.742 --> 21:14.948
Come on, chicken.

21:17.121 --> 21:19.363
Don't do this, Sam.

21:22.336 --> 21:24.707
l've played Ping-Pong.

21:28.675 --> 21:34.962
My father built me an elaborate rec room
when l was a child. My daddy liked me.

21:37.976 --> 21:43.730
Yeah, l bet you got lots of practice
staying home from all those proms.

21:50.030 --> 21:55.654
Yes. lt gave me the opportunity to
master the complexities of making toast.

21:56.538 --> 22:00.072
Nice serve, Diane. All right.

22:02.710 --> 22:05.118
Yeah, you'll be easy. l'm real worried.

22:19.185 --> 22:23.514
And since that time, Norm,
l've never feared death.

22:25.317 --> 22:28.602
- My point!
- Lucky shot. Come on, serve.

22:28.779 --> 22:32.361
- What are we doing?
- lt's called Ping-Pong. Serve.

22:33.158 --> 22:37.737
This all started out with us arguing
over who is the most competitive.

22:37.913 --> 22:41.163
What are we proving
by knocking a ball all night?

22:41.333 --> 22:44.251
lt won't be all night.
l'm about to win. Serve.

22:46.130 --> 22:50.424
Let's start by admitting
that we both have a problem.

22:51.552 --> 22:56.713
Let's put down our paddles
simultaneously and walk away from this.

22:59.436 --> 23:01.475
You're quitting? ls that it?

23:03.899 --> 23:08.146
As it so happens, l am a point ahead.
l could win on this serve.

23:08.320 --> 23:12.947
l am suggesting
a greater triumph for us both.

23:13.117 --> 23:17.067
A victory over this destructive problem
we both have.

23:17.246 --> 23:21.623
Let's beat our paddles
into ploughshares, Sam.

23:22.668 --> 23:24.328
Say again?

23:24.503 --> 23:27.504
Try this for me
and see if you don't feel better.

23:27.673 --> 23:29.749
l'm putting down my paddle.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.467
Join me in this victory, Sam.

23:47.109 --> 23:51.772
- How do you feel?
- l feel OK.

23:51.948 --> 23:56.028
- As a matter of fact, l feel pretty good.
- Good.

23:56.202 --> 23:58.824
- Like to buy me a cup of coffee?
- You bet.

23:58.996 --> 24:02.662
- How about that?
- Just one more thing.

24:04.794 --> 24:07.582
- l win!
- You're not getting out of here alive.

24:07.755 --> 24:10.129
- Don't be a sore loser.
- You'll be sore.

24:10.301 --> 24:12.257
That's why they call those paddles.
