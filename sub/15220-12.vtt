00:25.340 --> 00:27.718
Theorising that one could
time travel within his own lifetime,

00:27.718 --> 00:31.305
Dr Sam Beckett stepped into
the quantum leap accelerator

00:31.305 --> 00:33.348
and vanished.

00:38.020 --> 00:40.439
He woke to find himself
trapped in the past.

00:41.273 --> 00:44.234
Facing mirror images
that were not his own.

00:44.234 --> 00:47.321
And driven by an unknown force
to change history

00:47.321 --> 00:49.490
for the better.

00:49.490 --> 00:51.992
His only guide on this journey is Al,

00:51.992 --> 00:55.245
an observer from his own time,
who appears in the form

00:55.245 --> 00:58.207
of a hologram that only Sam
can see and hear.

00:59.333 --> 01:02.461
And so, Dr Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,

01:02.461 --> 01:05.379
striving to put right
what once went wrong

01:05.379 --> 01:09.218
and hoping each time
that his next leap...

01:09.218 --> 01:11.261
will be the leap home.

01:12.846 --> 01:17.100
Sweetie, come on. Every time
you do this, you act like
it's the first time.

01:17.100 --> 01:20.604
Oh, Lord! Hang on, baby.
It's gonna be all right.

01:20.604 --> 01:22.940
Get me a blood sample.

01:26.068 --> 01:28.195
You hang on.
Be careful!

01:28.697 --> 01:31.366
Oh, in the name of heaven,
be careful! Close the door.

01:31.366 --> 01:33.410
Stay out there.

01:35.203 --> 01:38.165
Get her clothes off.
Get her pants. Let's do the prep.

01:38.165 --> 01:40.292
What? No. No, no.

01:40.292 --> 01:42.461
Uh-uh.

01:42.461 --> 01:44.755
Just calm down.
No, I'm OK. I'm OK.

01:44.755 --> 01:46.798
Now, now.

01:48.842 --> 01:51.595
What's wrong with her?
What IS she doing?

01:55.056 --> 01:56.475
Oh, boy.

03:11.466 --> 03:13.593
No. No!

03:13.593 --> 03:15.720
Now, just relax, honey.

03:15.720 --> 03:18.181
Now, hang in there, little lady.

03:18.181 --> 03:20.892
It's just a contraction.
This...can't be happening.

03:20.892 --> 03:24.479
Help her into the saddle.
We got ourselves a baby to pull out.

03:24.479 --> 03:26.606
Come on, now. Slide in.
No!

03:26.606 --> 03:28.692
No, wait. You don't understand.
Hold on!

03:28.692 --> 03:30.860
Be careful, Billie Jean!

03:30.860 --> 03:33.113
Hey. Now, come on, honey.

03:34.281 --> 03:37.409
This little tike's coming
whether you co-operate or not. No!

03:37.409 --> 03:39.953
No, it's not. I feel better.
Really. I'm fine.

03:39.953 --> 03:43.581
I mean, I'm...I'm fine.
Well, suppose I take a look and see.

03:43.581 --> 03:46.167
No! I mean...it's not necessary.

03:46.167 --> 03:48.336
I mean, there's...there's no way

03:48.336 --> 03:51.589
that this baby is gonna be coming
right now. Trust me on that.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.012
All right. All right.

03:59.264 --> 04:01.391
Come on.

04:01.391 --> 04:03.518
That's it. Now.

04:03.518 --> 04:05.687
Nobody is gonna hurt you.

04:05.687 --> 04:08.064
Now, come over here.
Just sit down here.

04:10.025 --> 04:12.193
That's right.

04:12.193 --> 04:16.613
Now. Suppose you tell me just
how far apart those contractions are.

04:16.613 --> 04:18.742
Contractions?

04:18.742 --> 04:20.910
Oh, no.

04:20.910 --> 04:24.414
I mean, yes. But I...
They've stopped.

04:24.414 --> 04:27.000
Well, that's good.
Mm-hm.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.127
That's very good.
Mm-hm.

04:29.127 --> 04:31.296
How about your water?
Your water break?

04:34.674 --> 04:36.801
I don't think so.
Well...

04:36.801 --> 04:39.721
I reckon you'd've noticed
if you'd sprung a leak.

04:41.931 --> 04:44.184
Yeah.
You know, little lady...

04:46.728 --> 04:49.564
..having a baby
is about as simple as it gets.

04:50.940 --> 04:54.110
Women have been giving birth
since the beginning of time.

04:54.110 --> 04:57.113
And even if you may not know
what to do about it,

04:57.113 --> 04:59.157
your body does.

05:00.617 --> 05:02.660
I don't think so.

05:03.995 --> 05:06.122
You'd be surprised.

05:06.122 --> 05:08.625
So would you (!)

05:32.148 --> 05:35.527
From the dates on the calendar
at the hospital, I knew it was 1955.

05:35.527 --> 05:38.154
November 14th 1955.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.741
I also knew I was in Claremore,
Oklahoma.

05:43.409 --> 05:46.120
Correction.
Leaving Claremore, Oklahoma.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.373
Heading for God knows where to do...

05:50.375 --> 05:53.545
OK. I won't deal with that...
just now.

05:54.712 --> 05:59.676
I'll deal with who.
From the paperwork at the hospital,
I knew I was Billie Jean Crockett.

05:59.676 --> 06:03.304
I was 16 years old and Dotty,
Dorothy Louise Billings,

06:03.304 --> 06:05.390
was not my mother.
She had signed friend.

06:05.390 --> 06:07.850
And, from everything I could tell,

06:07.850 --> 06:10.562
Billie Jean could use
every friend she could get.

06:19.821 --> 06:23.866
Oh, Lord! I hope Effy pulled
them perm rods out of Leola's hair.

06:23.866 --> 06:28.413
Otherwise she's gonna look like the
star poodle at the dog and pony show.

06:33.459 --> 06:35.586
Effy?

06:35.586 --> 06:38.214
Effy? Did you take Leola down?

06:45.680 --> 06:48.266
Agh! Oh, my hair. 
My...my hair!

06:48.266 --> 06:52.645
This is all your fault,
you little two-bit hussy!

06:52.645 --> 06:54.355
Leola!

06:54.355 --> 06:56.524
Oh!

06:56.524 --> 06:59.235
You should've never taken
that trash in. Oh, stuff it!

06:59.235 --> 07:01.070
You stuff it!
And I told you

07:01.070 --> 07:03.990
we should never do the colour
and the perm at the same time.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.326
Are you all right, honey?
Yeah, yeah.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.536
I'm fine. I'm sorry.

07:08.536 --> 07:10.705
Oh, I'll fix it.

07:10.705 --> 07:13.583
You can't fix it!
It's purple, for heaven's sake!

07:13.583 --> 07:16.002
Well, it's kinda punk.

07:18.963 --> 07:21.090
It's gonna be very big in the '80s.

07:21.090 --> 07:24.385
Well...I don't know where Aidees is.

07:24.385 --> 07:28.723
But here in Oklahoma, we don't like
looking like an electrified
cotton candy!

07:28.723 --> 07:32.560
You can borrow Miss Parker's wig
till it grows out.
I do not want that cootie nest!

07:32.560 --> 07:36.355
I want my hair!
And I will tell you another thing.

07:36.355 --> 07:40.818
I will never step another foot
into this two-bit snake pit
of a beauty shop! Oh, Leola.

07:40.818 --> 07:43.154
You don't mean that.
Now, just calm down.

07:43.154 --> 07:46.365
We've been friends too many years.
Well, we ain't friends no more!

07:46.365 --> 07:49.577
Thanks to that harlot!
Oh, that's enough!

07:49.577 --> 07:51.871
Her own people tossed her out.

07:51.871 --> 07:54.082
She ain't your worry, Dotty.

07:54.082 --> 07:57.960
All she will do is ruin everything
you spent your entire life
working for.

07:57.960 --> 08:00.129
Oh!

08:00.129 --> 08:03.132
Tell her, Keeter.
Tell her to send that hussy home!

08:03.132 --> 08:05.301
What the hell happened to your head?

08:05.301 --> 08:08.096
Oh! I cannot believe I gotta
go through the rest of my life

08:08.096 --> 08:10.264
without this hair!

08:10.264 --> 08:12.433
Never did like that old biddy anyway.

08:12.433 --> 08:14.560
What happened to Leola's hair?
Sorry.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.063
I'm...
Oh, it ain't your fault, darlin'.

08:17.063 --> 08:19.148
Did Billie Jean do that to her?

08:20.858 --> 08:23.486
Did you do that to her hair? Huh?

08:23.486 --> 08:25.655
Uh, well, Dotty...

08:25.655 --> 08:27.490
had to take me
to the hospital and...

08:28.616 --> 08:30.868
Dotty? Dotty!

08:30.868 --> 08:35.206
Well, was I supposed to let her
have that baby right in the middle
of the beauty parlour?

08:36.499 --> 08:38.668
Well, now, she didn't drop it.
Did she?

08:38.668 --> 08:41.879
That's cos she ain't a cow.
And it was a false alarm.

08:41.879 --> 08:44.340
And if you had taken Leola down...

08:44.340 --> 08:48.344
That witch wouldn't let me lay one
brown finger on her if her life
depended on it.

08:48.344 --> 08:52.181
That's the God's truth. Effy
offered to take Leola's hair down.

08:52.181 --> 08:55.184
And Leola flat refused.
Said she's waiting for you.

08:55.184 --> 08:58.229
Right. I heard every word.
There must be something I can do.

08:58.229 --> 09:00.565
I think you've already done it.

09:00.565 --> 09:03.067
Don't start, Keeter.

09:03.067 --> 09:05.361
Huh? Start what, Dotty?

09:05.361 --> 09:08.739
Start what? One of your best
customers just walked out the door

09:08.739 --> 09:11.492
looking like she could tune in Mars,
but I'm not to start.

09:11.492 --> 09:14.829
I can handle Leola.
Maybe I should talk to her.

09:14.829 --> 09:17.331
Huh! You wouldn't
get a word in edgewise.

09:18.416 --> 09:20.585
Besides, she'll be back.

09:20.585 --> 09:24.547
Hell, we've been through more messes
than a fly on a manure pile.

09:26.674 --> 09:30.219
But you, young lady, had better
get yourself right into that parlour

09:30.219 --> 09:32.847
and get those feet up.
They're starting to swell.

09:32.847 --> 09:35.391
Yeah, why don't you do that, Sam?

09:35.391 --> 09:37.560
And then we can have a little talk.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.687
OK.
Hey.

09:39.687 --> 09:41.856
If I was you...

09:41.856 --> 09:44.442
I'd drop that kid...
and I'd get rid of it...

09:44.442 --> 09:46.485
before you cause any more trouble.

09:51.866 --> 09:54.952
Billie Jean was in full labour
when you leaped in, Sam.

09:54.952 --> 09:58.164
It took every doctor on the staff
to stop her.

09:58.164 --> 10:00.499
Not to mention
the shock she went into

10:00.499 --> 10:04.128
when she caught a glimpse of your
reflection in those O-R lamps.

10:04.128 --> 10:06.255
What if she has her baby
in the future?

10:06.255 --> 10:08.632
Well, Ziggy's very worried
about that.

10:08.632 --> 10:12.511
He says that there's an 86% chance
that when you leap out

10:12.511 --> 10:16.932
and Billie Jean leaps back,
the baby could stay in the future.

10:18.100 --> 10:20.227
She loses her baby?

10:20.227 --> 10:22.355
Well, she loses it anyway.

10:22.355 --> 10:26.567
In the original history, Billie Jean
put her baby up for adoption.

10:26.567 --> 10:30.154
Then she regretted it and spent the
rest of her life trying to find her.

10:30.154 --> 10:33.032
So, I'm here to change that.
Apparently, yes.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.202
How long until she has her baby?

10:36.202 --> 10:39.330
Uh...according to Ziggy,
about 36 hours...

10:41.415 --> 10:43.626
..unless...
Unless?

10:45.795 --> 10:48.714
Unless...you have it first.

10:50.174 --> 10:52.259
(LAUGHS)
What? What are you talking about?

10:52.259 --> 10:53.886
(LAUGHS)

10:54.970 --> 10:57.014
I ca-

10:58.390 --> 11:00.893
I can't have a baby!

11:00.893 --> 11:03.813
I know that.
But Ziggy's not so sure.

11:03.813 --> 11:07.233
I'm sure. I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.777
There's no way I could have a baby.
OK, OK.

11:09.777 --> 11:13.614
OK, calm down! You'll find yourself
going back into labour.

11:13.614 --> 11:16.283
I wasn't in labour!
Well, Billie Jean was.

11:16.283 --> 11:18.786
Oh!
And Ziggy says that...

11:18.786 --> 11:22.289
your brainwaves
are linked into her emotions

11:22.289 --> 11:24.834
and they're cross-channelling
into the baby.

11:24.834 --> 11:27.545
The baby's not here.
Well, never mind

11:27.545 --> 11:32.633
the baby's not here - the baby is
connecting with your mood swings.

11:32.633 --> 11:34.802
Ziggy says you're bonding.

11:34.802 --> 11:37.179
(KICKS SOMETHING OVER)
Bonding?

11:37.179 --> 11:39.390
Yes, bonding.
And that's a good thing.

11:39.390 --> 11:43.310
In case you deliver
before Billie Jean leaps back.

11:43.310 --> 11:45.437
I'm a man.
Yeah.

11:45.437 --> 11:48.148
I can't have a baby.
Men cannot have babies!

11:48.148 --> 11:50.150
I can't.
Oh!

11:51.318 --> 11:54.196
You don't look so good, Sam.
I just feel a little nauseous.

11:54.196 --> 11:56.323
Yeah, you look a little green...

11:56.323 --> 11:58.367
around the nostrils there.

11:59.451 --> 12:01.495
(PANTS)

12:04.540 --> 12:06.584
(RETCHES)

12:10.379 --> 12:13.757
(TOILET FLUSHES)
I told you not to upset yourself.

12:15.217 --> 12:17.344
I'm just sick.

12:17.344 --> 12:19.513
I can hear that.

12:19.513 --> 12:21.682
Oh, you probably got
the stomach flu.

12:21.682 --> 12:24.018
Everybody's got it.
It's going around.

12:28.188 --> 12:30.232
I don't have the flu.

12:31.734 --> 12:34.403
Listen. Are you sure
that there's no way...

12:34.403 --> 12:37.406
no way that Ziggy could be
right about this? Right?

12:37.406 --> 12:39.617
Oh, no way could Ziggy
be right about this.

12:39.617 --> 12:42.328
There's no way physically...

12:42.328 --> 12:45.372
that...you could carry a baby
in there.

12:45.372 --> 12:47.374
Right?
Right. Right.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.919
So...so then,
we're just saying that...

12:50.919 --> 12:54.048
Billie Jean is back...
in the waiting room...

12:54.048 --> 12:57.176
Yeah.
..and I'm here in 1955. Right?

12:57.176 --> 12:59.845
Uh...yeah, right.
She's there, you're here. Yeah.

12:59.845 --> 13:02.014
And it's just the illusion...

13:02.014 --> 13:06.101
of her physical aura...
that everybody's seeing.

13:06.101 --> 13:09.104
That's right. They see
an illusion of her physical aura.

13:09.104 --> 13:11.440
Not her body.
No, not her body. No. OK.

13:11.440 --> 13:13.442
So, why do I feel so nauseous?

13:16.111 --> 13:19.448
Uh...oh, it could be psychosomatic.

13:19.448 --> 13:21.617
Yeah. A lot of fathers have that.

13:21.617 --> 13:24.745
Who is the father, Al?
We don't know.

13:24.745 --> 13:27.664
And Dr Beaks says that Billie Jean

13:27.664 --> 13:29.875
is too traumatised
to push for an answer.

13:29.875 --> 13:33.253
(GROANS)
You feeling a little better?

13:33.253 --> 13:36.548
Yeah. Yeah, I'm just a little
bit tired, that's all. Tired?

13:36.548 --> 13:38.759
That means you got the flu.
Just like I said.

13:38.759 --> 13:42.096
I don't have the flu! Yeah?
Well, you're not pregnant either.

13:42.096 --> 13:44.431
Because...when you're pregnant...

13:45.516 --> 13:48.811
..the nausea and the fatigue
come in the first three months.

13:48.811 --> 13:50.813
And Billie Jean is at full term.

13:50.813 --> 13:53.315
And you can't be tired,
because you gotta figure out

13:53.315 --> 13:56.527
some way for...for the girl
to keep her baby.

13:56.527 --> 13:59.113
I'm just gonna rest a little bit,
Al, and then...

13:59.113 --> 14:03.909
I'll get up and I'll figure out...
how to patch up her and her family.

14:03.909 --> 14:06.036
That's a good idea, Sam.

14:06.036 --> 14:08.205
Yeah. You could ask her mother...

14:08.205 --> 14:11.959
That's a bad idea...Sam.
Her mother's dead.

14:11.959 --> 14:14.294
Died when she was 12.

14:14.294 --> 14:16.630
And her father even refuses
to see her.

14:17.714 --> 14:18.715
Who?

14:19.842 --> 14:21.969
Billie Jean's father.

14:21.969 --> 14:24.096
Bob Crockett is his name.

14:24.096 --> 14:26.807
He's a...foreman at Kip Petroleum.

14:27.933 --> 14:30.602
Lives at 243 Prairie Lane Drive
in Claremore.

14:31.687 --> 14:33.605
243 Fairy Lane Dr...

14:33.605 --> 14:36.733
No, not fairy. Prairie, with a P.
P-p-p-prairie Lane...

14:37.818 --> 14:39.278
..Drive.

14:43.907 --> 14:47.119
Something tells me
we're in...big trouble.

14:49.413 --> 14:50.956
Big.

14:55.621 --> 14:58.165
I'd spent a sleepless night
drinking water

14:58.165 --> 15:00.668
and making 900 trips to the bathroom.

15:01.794 --> 15:05.172
The whole time wondering
what to say to a man I'd never met

15:05.172 --> 15:07.675
about his daughter
and her unborn child.

15:07.675 --> 15:10.678
Yet, as I lived another day
in Billie Jean's shoes,

15:10.678 --> 15:12.805
I couldn't help but feel that somehow

15:12.805 --> 15:14.848
this baby truly belonged with Billie.

15:16.392 --> 15:18.686
Are you sure you wanna do this,
honey?

15:18.686 --> 15:22.273
I mean, some things are just
better worked out after the fact.

15:23.857 --> 15:26.735
I don't think...
I'd be here if I had a choice.

15:26.735 --> 15:29.363
Well, then,
just wait till the baby comes.

15:29.363 --> 15:33.075
I'll bet you a $2 hog that little
tike'll just melt his heart

15:33.075 --> 15:35.661
and everything'll turn out
just right as pie.

15:35.661 --> 15:37.830
Let's just say that uh...

15:37.830 --> 15:40.207
history books are saying
that won't happen.

15:40.207 --> 15:42.585
There's your dad. Bob?

15:51.719 --> 15:53.846
What are you doing here, Billie?
Oh, Bob!

15:53.846 --> 15:57.808
Say hello to the child. It's
between me and my daughter, Dotty.

15:57.808 --> 16:00.477
I'm glad to hear
there's something between you two.

16:00.477 --> 16:03.480
I didn't realise you knew each other.
Well, your daddy and I -

16:03.480 --> 16:07.026
Went to high school together.
We were a bit more than classmates.

16:07.026 --> 16:10.362
What do you want, Billie?
Just wanted to talk.

16:11.989 --> 16:14.158
(MEN TALKING AND SNIGGERING)

16:14.158 --> 16:16.827
It's not a freak show!
Why don't you all get back to work?

16:20.247 --> 16:22.374
We've got nothing to talk about.

16:22.374 --> 16:24.585
Talk to her, Bobby.

16:24.585 --> 16:26.628
Can't hurt nothing.

16:32.426 --> 16:36.513
Better get outta sight. Folks here
have enough to gossip about already.

16:38.307 --> 16:40.434
Go on. I'll wait right here for you.

16:40.434 --> 16:42.478
Come on. Go ahead.

17:00.662 --> 17:02.790
Miss Thailer called to uh...

17:02.790 --> 17:04.833
say you decided to give up the baby.

17:04.833 --> 17:08.045
Miss Thailer? The woman from
the adoption agency? Oh, yeah. Right.

17:08.045 --> 17:10.214
Yeah. Miss Thailer.

17:10.214 --> 17:12.758
Right. Well, that's kinda
what I wanted to...

17:12.758 --> 17:14.801
talk to you about.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.305
See, I've...

17:18.305 --> 17:22.851
I've decided to keep the baby. And
I can't do that without your help.

17:22.851 --> 17:26.480
Well, you can get help from whoever
the hell it was that knocked you up.

17:26.480 --> 17:29.108
No, I can't.

17:29.108 --> 17:31.026
You can't, or you won't?

17:31.026 --> 17:33.529
The only way you're gonna be able
to keep that baby

17:33.529 --> 17:36.323
is if you get him to do the right
thing by you and marry you.

17:37.407 --> 17:39.243
That is, if he's not married already.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.789
Well, I...I don't know.
You don't know?

17:43.789 --> 17:45.916
I mean, I don't know...

17:45.916 --> 17:48.460
if I should get married.

17:48.460 --> 17:50.546
If marriage is
the right thing to do.

17:50.546 --> 17:53.507
Little girl...you're pregnant.

17:55.801 --> 17:58.512
Being pregnant isn't
a reason to get married.

17:58.512 --> 18:00.681
It's...it's just an option.

18:02.975 --> 18:05.602
And so is bringing this baby up
in a home...

18:07.229 --> 18:09.273
..and a family with you.

18:10.858 --> 18:14.027
I'm not gonna spend the rest of
my life paying for your mistake.

18:14.027 --> 18:16.697
This mistake'll be your grandchild.

18:16.697 --> 18:19.700
I don't have a grandchild
and I don't want a grandchild!

18:21.743 --> 18:24.204
Now, if you wanna come back home,
we can work that out.

18:25.581 --> 18:27.624
But not until you have this baby...

18:29.293 --> 18:31.795
..and get rid of it.

19:10.292 --> 19:14.546
Talking to Billie Jean's dad left me
feeling sad, angry and frustrated.

19:15.714 --> 19:17.841
But mostly,
it left me feeling lucky.

19:17.841 --> 19:21.261
Lucky to grow up in a family
with parents who listened to me.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.930
Guided me when I was
lost or confused

19:23.930 --> 19:26.433
and who always seemed to be there
when I needed them.

19:27.559 --> 19:30.896
I wanted to give Billie Jean the
chance to be that kind of a parent.

19:30.896 --> 19:33.774
There's a Cassy Thailer here
to see you, Billie Jean.

19:35.817 --> 19:37.903
Ah.
Hi.

19:37.903 --> 19:40.072
Do you mind?

19:40.072 --> 19:43.992
No. I just have some...stuff
to finish up in there.

19:43.992 --> 19:46.119
Are you gonna be all right, honey?

19:46.119 --> 19:48.163
Sure.

19:50.791 --> 19:54.002
Effy? Effy!
You get in here this minute!

19:55.128 --> 19:57.214
I brought those papers
for you to sign.

19:57.214 --> 19:59.341
Papers?

19:59.341 --> 20:01.468
The adoption papers.

20:01.468 --> 20:03.512
You're due this week, aren't you?

20:05.389 --> 20:07.432
Well, yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.

20:09.434 --> 20:11.561
OK. Now, you just sign...

20:11.561 --> 20:13.605
all five copies.

20:17.109 --> 20:19.236
Can I read 'em first?
Of course you can.

20:19.236 --> 20:22.030
But they're just...
they're just legal talk.

20:22.030 --> 20:24.908
It says the agency has your approval

20:24.908 --> 20:27.035
to put your baby up for adoption.

20:27.035 --> 20:29.079
(SIGHS)

20:31.540 --> 20:33.708
Mrs Thailer, if um...

20:33.708 --> 20:36.878
if I sign these papers and...
and then I change my mind...

20:38.213 --> 20:40.257
..can I ever get my baby back?

20:41.716 --> 20:45.220
Well, no.
Can I ever see her again?

20:45.220 --> 20:47.097
No.

20:49.850 --> 20:54.354
So, then, I'll...never know
where my baby goes. Billie Jean.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.523
Honey.

20:56.523 --> 20:59.943
Where your baby goes
is not important.

21:02.279 --> 21:04.406
It's very important.

21:04.406 --> 21:06.908
What's important...

21:06.908 --> 21:10.620
is that your baby
will be with a good family.

21:10.620 --> 21:13.331
And it will have a wonderful life.

21:16.459 --> 21:19.754
I can't ever know that...
if I can't see her.

21:19.754 --> 21:22.966
Well, I can.
It's not your baby.

21:22.966 --> 21:25.135
It's my baby.
Billie Jean.

21:26.261 --> 21:29.097
No-one in the world will think
that you are a bad person

21:29.097 --> 21:32.100
because you wanted
a better life for your child.

21:32.100 --> 21:35.353
Mrs Thailer, I believe in adoption.
I really do.

21:35.353 --> 21:38.440
Good. Then let me help your baby

21:38.440 --> 21:40.859
find the kind of a life
you can't provide it.

21:40.859 --> 21:43.445
Not...not because you don't want to.

21:44.863 --> 21:47.657
But because you need
to take care of yourself.

21:47.657 --> 21:51.202
You don't understand. You need to
finish growing up, honey. To...

21:51.202 --> 21:54.247
To find out what it is
you want to do.

21:56.041 --> 21:58.168
I know what I wanna do.

21:58.168 --> 22:00.211
I...

22:02.297 --> 22:04.341
I wanna keep my baby.

22:05.800 --> 22:08.511
Honey, what has brought on
this sudden change of heart?

22:10.722 --> 22:12.766
Uh...

22:15.143 --> 22:18.104
You know that expression,
'God works in mysterious ways'?

22:18.104 --> 22:20.231
It's one of my favourites.

22:20.231 --> 22:22.984
Well, I think this is one of 'em.
I think that...

22:22.984 --> 22:26.237
my change of heart
is God's way of telling me...

22:26.237 --> 22:28.281
that he doesn't want me to...

22:31.076 --> 22:33.119
..to make another mistake.

22:35.955 --> 22:39.084
You're not gonna sign those papers,
are you? No, ma'am.

22:41.836 --> 22:44.381
Oh, honey,
I hope it works out for you.

22:46.633 --> 22:48.676
I truly, truly do.

23:02.190 --> 23:05.318
Oh, honey, you just look like
you've lost the war!

23:06.403 --> 23:08.571
Just a few major battles.

23:08.571 --> 23:12.951
Your daddy'll come around. He's
still hurting from losing your mom.

23:12.951 --> 23:16.246
You and he were more than classmates,
weren't you? Well...

23:17.372 --> 23:20.375
That's just all water
under the bridge. You know.

23:20.375 --> 23:22.419
What happened?
Ah, well...

23:23.962 --> 23:27.298
Oh, now, come on. You got much more
important things to worry about

23:27.298 --> 23:29.801
than what your daddy and I di-

23:29.801 --> 23:32.554
(LAUGHS)
That was a hell of a kick!

23:34.514 --> 23:37.016
I...I felt that.

23:37.016 --> 23:39.185
Well, of course you did.

23:39.185 --> 23:41.729
That baby of yours has a kick
like a mule in heat.

23:41.729 --> 23:44.190
Oh, boy!
You know what?

23:45.525 --> 23:47.569
I think so too.

23:51.768 --> 23:54.145
Sam, that is disgusting!

23:54.145 --> 23:56.273
How can you eat that?!

23:56.273 --> 23:58.441
Actually, it's pretty good.

23:58.441 --> 24:02.279
I know folks go for funny stuff
when they're having babies, but...

24:02.279 --> 24:04.406
Jello and onions?

24:04.406 --> 24:07.284
I mean, don't you wonder
what you're hatching down there?

24:07.284 --> 24:09.661
Have you got cravings, or something?

24:09.661 --> 24:12.789
You're craving?
I just wanted jello and onions.

24:12.789 --> 24:14.958
OK, OK!

24:14.958 --> 24:18.461
Don't call me in the middle of
the night when you get stomach pains.

24:18.461 --> 24:21.423
Miss Dotty said come into the shop
when you're feeling better.

24:22.549 --> 24:24.843
Mm-hm. Thank you.

24:27.053 --> 24:29.347
Al.
What?

24:29.347 --> 24:31.975
I felt the baby kick.

24:31.975 --> 24:34.436
What?
I felt Billie Jean's baby

24:34.436 --> 24:36.604
kick inside of me, right there.

24:36.604 --> 24:39.149
Gas.
What?

24:39.149 --> 24:42.944
You probably feel gas
from eating this junk!

24:42.944 --> 24:45.322
No, no, no. Dotty felt it too.

24:45.322 --> 24:49.284
That's a neat trick, since Billie
Jean's baby is inside Billie Jean

24:49.284 --> 24:51.453
40 years in the future (!)

24:51.453 --> 24:54.497
All I know is,
Dotty had her hand on my stomach.

24:54.497 --> 24:57.125
And we both felt the baby kick.

24:57.125 --> 25:00.503
That's impossible. Well,
maybe it isn't. I mean, maybe...

25:01.588 --> 25:03.715
Maybe when I came in...

25:03.715 --> 25:05.842
and Billie Jean leaped...

25:05.842 --> 25:07.719
the baby stayed.

25:08.928 --> 25:11.014
Huh?
Read my lips.

25:11.014 --> 25:13.433
It's impossible, Sam.

25:13.433 --> 25:15.602
So just...

25:15.602 --> 25:17.979
forget about being
the first male mother

25:17.979 --> 25:20.440
and concentrate on finding a way

25:20.440 --> 25:22.817
for Billie Jean
to get to keep her baby.

25:22.817 --> 25:25.195
What happened
when you talked to the father?

25:25.195 --> 25:27.363
Oh, well, nothing good.

25:27.363 --> 25:31.117
It'd take a miracle for him
to accept Billie Jean and her baby.

25:31.117 --> 25:33.286
Well, you'd better work a miracle.

25:33.286 --> 25:36.790
Because according to Ziggy, that
baby is due in less than five hours.

25:36.790 --> 25:38.875
(SIGHS)
God!

25:38.875 --> 25:41.002
What? What's wrong now?

25:41.002 --> 25:43.046
It's so hot in here.

25:47.717 --> 25:49.844
Hot flashes.
Huh?

25:49.844 --> 25:53.056
I'm having hot flashes.
You're not having hot flashes!

25:53.056 --> 25:55.725
Yeah, right.
And I'm not having cravings.

25:55.725 --> 25:58.520
But I'm sitting here
eating jello and onions. Al.

25:58.520 --> 26:00.772
(LAUGHS)
Read MY lips.

26:00.772 --> 26:02.607
I'm pregnant.

26:06.569 --> 26:10.240
You are NOT...pregnant, Sam!

26:10.240 --> 26:12.408
But you are running out of time.

26:14.327 --> 26:16.913
Who's the father? I mean...

26:19.582 --> 26:21.668
Did Billie Jean tell you
who the father is?

26:24.712 --> 26:27.632
No. Dr Beaks wouldn't let me
get near Billie Jean.

26:30.093 --> 26:32.637
I've gotta find a way
to buy Billie Jean some time.

26:32.637 --> 26:34.681
I gotta find a way.

26:35.974 --> 26:38.768
You gotta get real, Sam.
Huh?

26:38.768 --> 26:41.688
Billie Jean doesn't even have
a high school education.

26:41.688 --> 26:45.733
She hasn't the slightest prospect
of finding a job to support herself.

26:45.733 --> 26:49.279
And even if she found a job,
who's gonna stay with the baby

26:49.279 --> 26:51.906
while she's doing
whatever job it is she finds?

26:51.906 --> 26:54.033
(SIGHS)

26:54.033 --> 26:56.160
Dotty.

26:56.160 --> 26:58.329
Dotty! Dotty's been...

26:58.329 --> 27:01.124
She's been right under our noses
all this time.

27:01.124 --> 27:03.251
(LAUGHS)

27:03.251 --> 27:05.295
What's so funny?

27:06.754 --> 27:08.923
Oh, Dotty. Hang on, Sam. No, no.

27:08.923 --> 27:11.759
Look. If Dotty had wanted Billie
to stay with her,

27:11.759 --> 27:14.637
it would've happened 40 years ago -
you wouldn't even be here.

27:16.639 --> 27:19.225
Well, maybe nobody thought of it
back then.

27:19.225 --> 27:21.436
You keep talking to yourself
like that,

27:21.436 --> 27:24.564
little men in white coats gonna
come in here and take you away.

27:24.564 --> 27:26.524
Thought of what?

27:26.524 --> 27:30.987
Now, Sam, you wanna be very careful
how you handle this.

27:30.987 --> 27:35.158
It's a way to...help me keep
this baby. Oh, that's subtle (!)

27:35.158 --> 27:39.245
Oh, honey. I thought you were
giving that baby up for adoption.

27:39.245 --> 27:41.414
Well, I was. But I'm not now.

27:41.414 --> 27:44.542
I'm...I'm not sure that
that's the best thing to do.

27:44.542 --> 27:46.836
For who? You or that little baby?

27:46.836 --> 27:50.673
Both. The best thing would've been
not to have got knocked up
in the first place.

27:50.673 --> 27:52.800
This is bad timing, Sam.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.594
Drink your beer, Keeter!

27:54.594 --> 27:57.764
Billie Jean. You are a young girl

27:57.764 --> 27:59.807
with your whole life
in front of you.

27:59.807 --> 28:02.643
Now, you don't wanna
have it ruined by a baby.

28:02.643 --> 28:05.146
What if it's not ruined, though?

28:05.146 --> 28:08.066
What if I'm supposed to
have this baby in my life?

28:08.066 --> 28:11.152
Well, that might be true,
if you had a husband and a home.

28:11.152 --> 28:14.697
But you don't. You don't have a soul
who'll help you with that baby.

28:15.823 --> 28:17.950
Not now, Sam. Not now.

28:17.950 --> 28:20.953
Dotty will help me. Won't you, Dotty?

28:20.953 --> 28:23.539
That's it!

28:23.539 --> 28:27.210
I'm outta here. I'm going down
to have myself another beer.

28:28.711 --> 28:30.922
I'll have supper in a jiffy, Keeter.

28:32.799 --> 28:34.842
Feed it to momma (!)

28:44.102 --> 28:46.479
Look what you did!
Sorry, Dotty. You just...

28:46.479 --> 28:50.233
You're the only one left to help me.
I can't have a baby in here!

28:50.233 --> 28:52.777
It won't take up much room.
No.

28:52.777 --> 28:55.571
Keeter would just be outta here
quicker than I could spit!

28:55.571 --> 28:58.533
Uh...he's outta here anyway, Sam.

28:58.533 --> 29:00.701
He never does marry her.

29:00.701 --> 29:04.831
I promised him that you'd be gone
as soon as that baby comes.

29:04.831 --> 29:08.793
I don't want you to go back on that.
But I don't wanna lose
the baby either.

29:08.793 --> 29:10.962
Well, you do not have a choice!

29:10.962 --> 29:13.381
You can work here part-time
if you want to.

29:13.381 --> 29:15.800
But you have got to
give that baby away.

29:15.800 --> 29:18.845
Look. If I do that...
I'm gonna lose her for ever.

29:18.845 --> 29:21.764
And if you don't, I'll lose Keeter!

29:21.764 --> 29:25.726
Well, you might lose him anyway.
Shut your mouth!

29:25.726 --> 29:28.229
Now, look here, Billie Jean.

29:28.229 --> 29:30.773
I have given you a home, a job.

29:30.773 --> 29:34.068
The food on your plate.
And don't you go asking me

29:34.068 --> 29:37.363
to give up my life for you -
because I won't!

29:38.531 --> 29:40.575
I just won't!

29:52.920 --> 29:55.214
Well...she's right, Sam.

29:55.214 --> 29:58.634
You can't ask her to take on
all of Billie's problems.

29:58.634 --> 30:00.803
Well, maybe they're opportunities.

30:00.803 --> 30:04.432
Maybe this is a chance for her...
to love someone.

30:04.432 --> 30:06.601
If Keeter's gonna leave her anyway -

30:06.601 --> 30:09.145
But she doesn't know that.
And you can't tell her.

30:09.145 --> 30:11.606
There's gotta be somebody
who can help me, Al!

30:11.606 --> 30:13.733
Well, you tried your father.

30:13.733 --> 30:15.902
You tried...Dotty.

30:15.902 --> 30:20.323
There's...who? There's nobody else.
Nobody but the father of this baby.

30:20.323 --> 30:24.577
God knows where he is.
Willis is probably walking home
from work about now.

30:26.787 --> 30:29.040
Out of the mouths of babes.
Willis?

30:29.040 --> 30:32.084
It's after five.
He'd be quitting about now. Effy...

30:32.084 --> 30:33.961
I really need to talk to him.

30:33.961 --> 30:36.297
I thought you two swore
never to see each other.

30:36.297 --> 30:38.424
Well...we did.

30:38.424 --> 30:40.593
But I...I kinda changed my mind.

30:41.297 --> 30:44.633
Yeah. You know, he's probably
quitting right now and...

30:44.633 --> 30:46.802
he's gonna be driving home to...

30:46.802 --> 30:50.848
That baby must be sucking your
brain dry. Willis ain't got no car.

30:52.808 --> 30:55.019
No, of course not.
What can I be thinking of?

30:55.019 --> 30:57.438
No. He's...he's probably just...
you know...

30:57.438 --> 30:59.607
walking down old uh...

30:59.607 --> 31:02.318
Uh...
Water Tower road.

31:02.318 --> 31:05.654
Water Tower Road.
That's where I'll find him.

31:05.654 --> 31:07.823
Water Tower Road. OK.

31:07.823 --> 31:10.117
I got it, Sam.
It's about a mile west of here.

31:11.535 --> 31:13.704
You're not really gonna talk to him,
are you?

31:14.789 --> 31:16.832
He's my last chance.

31:18.834 --> 31:20.961
I know you really don't love Willis.

31:20.961 --> 31:23.380
So you'd be making a big mistake

31:23.380 --> 31:25.925
if you made him marry you
just to hold on to your baby.

31:36.811 --> 31:38.979
Sam, you should be taking it easy.

31:38.979 --> 31:41.273
What are you doing walking here?
It's crazy.

31:41.273 --> 31:43.359
I can't take it easy.
If I take it easy,

31:43.359 --> 31:45.319
I'll never find a home for Billie.

31:45.319 --> 31:47.947
And if I don't find her a home,
I'm not gonna leap.

31:47.947 --> 31:49.990
How much longer till the baby comes?

31:50.991 --> 31:53.119
Two hours 27 minutes.

31:53.119 --> 31:55.246
Oh!

31:55.246 --> 31:57.414
What? What's wrong?

31:57.414 --> 32:00.126
Ah, I think it's just
too much jello and onions.

32:00.126 --> 32:02.253
Oh.

32:02.253 --> 32:04.421
Now, listen. Don't get your hopes up.

32:04.421 --> 32:06.549
Because this Willis guy
is probably just

32:06.549 --> 32:08.968
some yahoo who could care less
about Billie Jean.

32:08.968 --> 32:11.220
He doesn't have to care about
Billie, as long as

32:11.220 --> 32:14.181
he accepts responsibility
and helps her out.

32:14.181 --> 32:17.434
Come on. This is the '50s. What
high school kid could pay for a baby?

32:17.434 --> 32:20.479
If you think I'm doing this wrong,
come up with a better idea!

32:20.479 --> 32:22.648
Or better yet, ask Billie Jean.

32:22.648 --> 32:26.277
But not the terrified 16-year-old.
Find Billie Jean the woman.

32:26.277 --> 32:29.071
The one who spent her whole life
looking for her only child.

32:29.071 --> 32:32.366
Ask her what she wants me to do.
Well, don't bite my head off.

32:32.366 --> 32:35.119
Willis is just as responsible
for this baby as I am.

32:35.119 --> 32:38.539
You mean Billie Jean is.
He's gotta face his
responsibilities like a man.

32:39.623 --> 32:41.667
Or like a boy.

32:42.751 --> 32:45.004
That's Willis?

32:46.463 --> 32:49.758
Well, no wonder she never told
her father who got her pregnant.

32:49.758 --> 32:51.927
He works for him.

32:51.927 --> 32:55.097
He doesn't look like
what I'd pictured. No, me either.

32:55.097 --> 32:57.516
He's just a boy.
Well, you're just a girl.

32:59.643 --> 33:02.438
Well...I'm gonna leave
the two of you alone.

33:19.788 --> 33:21.832
Hey, Billie Jean.

33:23.208 --> 33:25.336
Willis.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.463
I guess you're due pretty soon, huh?

33:27.463 --> 33:29.632
Sooner than you think.

33:29.632 --> 33:32.468
Yeah. Well, at least now
it'll all be over.

33:33.969 --> 33:36.138
No. It won't.

33:36.138 --> 33:39.016
You should've let Momma Elliott
fix things.

33:39.016 --> 33:41.393
Abortion?
It just would've made things

33:41.393 --> 33:43.395
a lot easier on everybody.

33:46.398 --> 33:48.442
Well, that's no longer an option.

33:50.152 --> 33:53.113
The point is...what do we do now?

33:53.113 --> 33:56.533
I told you.
I can't do nothing, Billie.

33:56.533 --> 34:00.162
I got my scholarship, Billie.
I start school in January.

34:00.162 --> 34:02.581
I'll be the first Taylor ever
to go to college.

34:02.581 --> 34:05.959
Well, that's fine for you.
But what about me and the baby?

34:07.127 --> 34:09.129
You told me you were
gonna give it up.

34:12.549 --> 34:15.344
Well, I...I can't.

34:15.344 --> 34:17.513
You have to!

34:17.513 --> 34:21.058
What the hell are you gonna do?
You ain't even finished high school.

34:21.058 --> 34:24.561
Maybe it's time I did.
Oh. With a baby (!)

34:24.561 --> 34:27.231
And your help.
I told you.

34:27.231 --> 34:29.983
I can't help you, Billie Jean.

34:29.983 --> 34:32.235
My scholarship only pays for
my tuition.

34:32.235 --> 34:34.405
I have to work
to earn my room and board.

34:34.405 --> 34:37.241
I can't be sending you enough money
to keep a baby.

34:37.241 --> 34:39.784
You should've thought about that
before you made one.

34:39.784 --> 34:41.954
Well, I didn't make it alone.

34:51.255 --> 34:53.465
I liked you, Billie.

34:53.465 --> 34:57.761
I liked you a lot.
I liked that way we talked about
books and travelling.

34:57.761 --> 35:01.181
You're the only person in this dumb
little town who understood me.

35:03.934 --> 35:06.562
I really wish there was
some way that I could help you.

35:06.562 --> 35:08.522
But there just ain't.

35:10.190 --> 35:12.234
I'm sorry too.

35:13.986 --> 35:17.156
Oh, damn it, Billie! You're the one
who told me to go to college!

35:17.156 --> 35:19.616
You told me to make something
outta myself.

35:19.616 --> 35:23.453
Now you wanna...trap me here
in this stupid little town!

35:23.453 --> 35:25.497
I gotta get outta here.

35:27.124 --> 35:29.251
And if you had a lick of sense,

35:29.251 --> 35:31.378
you'd give up that baby...

35:31.378 --> 35:33.380
and you'd get outta here too.

35:44.182 --> 35:46.268
(GROANS)

36:36.791 --> 36:38.960
You gonna break
every nail on your hands.

36:38.960 --> 36:42.380
You got a better way of doing this,
I'm all ears (!)

36:42.380 --> 36:45.050
No. But I can't do your nails again.

36:45.050 --> 36:48.303
My momma's turning 50 today
and I gotta get home for her party.

36:48.303 --> 36:50.430
Get the other tyre.

36:50.430 --> 36:53.099
OK, OK. I'll get dirty, though.

36:53.099 --> 36:55.143
Just get the damn tyre!

37:09.908 --> 37:14.037
I told you to get the tyre, Effy,
not manufacture it (!)

37:15.997 --> 37:18.375
Oh, Lord! Oh!

37:20.252 --> 37:22.420
Hospital.

37:22.420 --> 37:24.547
You gotta get me to the hospital!
Oh, Lord!

37:24.547 --> 37:27.509
Honey, my car has a flat!
You look horrible.

37:27.509 --> 37:29.678
You look just fine.

37:29.678 --> 37:31.805
Call a doctor!
And my father.

37:31.805 --> 37:34.516
The numbers are
on the wall there by the phone.

37:34.516 --> 37:36.935
Call my father!
You'll be all right, honey.

37:36.935 --> 37:39.688
Just hang on. We'll get you there.
Don't you worry.

37:41.022 --> 37:43.358
Come on, honey.

37:45.527 --> 37:47.654
Here it comes.
No. It'll be all right.

37:47.654 --> 37:50.240
Get right over here.
Sit yourself down.

37:52.409 --> 37:56.371

37:56.371 --> 37:59.082
OK.
(GROANS)

37:59.082 --> 38:01.376
OK. Breathe in. All right.

(THUNDERCLAP)

38:07.257 --> 38:09.300
Effy!

38:11.052 --> 38:13.179
There was an accident
on the Knowles Farm.

38:13.179 --> 38:16.307
Dr Rogers is in surgery,
fixing their oldest boy's leg.

38:16.307 --> 38:19.144
The nurse says get her to Claremore
or deliver it yourself.

38:20.228 --> 38:22.480
Don't look at me. I can't help you.

38:22.480 --> 38:24.858
Well, you're gonna!
What about my father?

38:24.858 --> 38:27.068
Tried both numbers, work and home.
No answer.

38:27.068 --> 38:30.113
You've gotta get hold of him.
Don't worry. We'll find him.

38:30.113 --> 38:32.907
Run to the field. Her daddy's
probably working outside.

38:32.907 --> 38:36.119
That's all the way over in -
I'm going, I'm going!

38:38.288 --> 38:41.207
Keeter! I forgot about Keeter!

38:41.207 --> 38:45.128
He's been out on the rig so long,
I just plum forgot about him.

38:50.091 --> 38:52.218
Hello, Tom? It's Dotty.

38:52.218 --> 38:54.262
You got Keeter down there?

38:55.930 --> 38:58.641
Keeter? Oh, Keeter.
I need you to come home.

38:58.641 --> 39:01.394
What the hell for, Dot?

39:01.394 --> 39:04.522
Billie's having her baby and I have
got to get her to the hospital.

39:05.690 --> 39:09.194
So? Drive her.
Well, I got a flat tyre.

39:09.194 --> 39:11.321
Fix it, Dot!

39:11.321 --> 39:13.698
Keeter. She doesn't have much time.

39:13.698 --> 39:15.825
It's probably another false alarm.

39:15.825 --> 39:18.453
Keeter, we need your help here.

39:18.453 --> 39:22.290
No, Dot.
The knocked up trash needs my help.

39:22.290 --> 39:25.043
And she can need my help
until Hell freezes over.

39:25.043 --> 39:28.630
She ain't gonna get it.
Keeter, you selfish son of a bitch!

39:28.630 --> 39:31.216
If you don't bring your butt
over here this minute,

39:31.216 --> 39:33.259
don't you bother
bringing it back at all!

too far along to turn back now.

How far apart are they?

39:55.698 --> 39:58.284
Five minutes.

All right. Come on, darlin'.

40:56.426 --> 40:58.386
I've been better (!)

41:00.555 --> 41:02.890
Oh!
Why don't you let me drive?

41:04.600 --> 41:06.728
(GROANS)

41:06.728 --> 41:09.022
Because you're busy (!)

41:18.364 --> 41:20.408
Come on, Mr Crockett. Be here!

41:23.453 --> 41:25.580
Can I help you, gal?
Mr Crockett.

41:25.580 --> 41:27.623
Billie Jean's having her baby.

41:31.669 --> 41:34.255
It was bound to happen.
She's asking for you.

41:34.255 --> 41:36.424
She don't need me to
 have no baby.

41:36.424 --> 41:40.553
But Dotty's car broke down and she's
got no way to get her to hospital.

41:40.553 --> 41:43.556
She can have the baby at home
like her momma had her.

41:43.556 --> 41:45.683
Billie's hurtin' real bad.

41:45.683 --> 41:47.602
I...I think she might die.

41:48.936 --> 41:51.105
She's 16 years old.

41:51.105 --> 41:53.316
She's not gonna die
from having no baby.

41:53.316 --> 41:55.485
My sister was 17.

41:55.485 --> 41:57.820
She bled to death
in my momma's arms.

42:07.205 --> 42:09.332
Oh! They're coming again!

42:09.332 --> 42:11.459
OK, sit, sit.

42:11.459 --> 42:13.503
(GROANS)

42:16.881 --> 42:19.050
Y'all wait right there.

42:19.050 --> 42:21.677
Where the hell have you been?!
I'm right here, honey.

42:21.677 --> 42:24.889
In the waiting room with Billie Jean.
The poor kid is terrified.

42:24.889 --> 42:28.226
She thinks she's having a baby
in an alien spaceship.

42:28.226 --> 42:30.394
Here. Drink this.
I'm having this baby!

42:30.394 --> 42:33.773
No, you're not, Sam.
Honey, they can tell that.

42:33.773 --> 42:36.818
Billie Jean's having the baby
40 years in the future.

42:36.818 --> 42:39.362
I'm in labour
and I'm having this baby!

42:39.362 --> 42:41.781
Who's she trying to convince?
Us or herself?

42:43.533 --> 42:46.994
Aaargh! Honey, how far apart
are your contractions?

42:48.454 --> 42:50.706
Contractions? Sam!

42:50.706 --> 42:52.875
You're not having any contractions!

42:52.875 --> 42:56.546
We lost count.
It's physically impossible.

42:56.546 --> 42:58.923
Impossible?
I'm sorry, darlin'.

42:58.923 --> 43:02.677
I've been a little busy
to watch the clock.
Help me get these clothes off.

43:02.677 --> 43:05.763
Sam, this is all happening
in your imagination.

43:05.763 --> 43:09.433
Go to Hell!
All right, young lady.
You just watch your language.

43:09.433 --> 43:11.769
Yeah, take it easy, Sam.

43:11.769 --> 43:13.854
Aaargh!
(PANTS)

43:13.854 --> 43:15.898
What are you doing, honey?

43:15.898 --> 43:18.734
He's breathing.
Why is she doing that?

43:18.734 --> 43:22.697
Beats the hell outta me.
It makes the contractions easi-

43:22.697 --> 43:24.865
Why am I telling you?
You can't hear me.

43:24.865 --> 43:27.618
You are gonna hyperventilate
if you keep this up.

43:27.618 --> 43:30.580
(PANTS) It's not working.
What's not working?

43:30.580 --> 43:33.291
Course it's not working.
You're not really in labour!

43:33.291 --> 43:35.334
Yes, I am!

43:37.837 --> 43:39.922
Let me help you.

43:42.300 --> 43:44.385
All right.
Now, you're gonna have a baby.

43:44.385 --> 43:47.013
It happens every day. OK.

43:47.013 --> 43:50.641
How far is she dilated?
I've been fighting to get
her clothes off.

43:50.641 --> 43:53.477
I haven't been able to do the prep
or time the contractions.

43:53.477 --> 43:55.938
All right, Billie Jean.
Let's have a look. No!

43:55.938 --> 43:58.441
Al. You gotta help me.
Who?

43:58.441 --> 44:00.443
What's happening?

44:00.443 --> 44:04.155
Get her to the delivery room.
The baby's head is crowning!

44:04.155 --> 44:07.700
The head is crowning? I don't know,
cos you won't let me look!

44:07.700 --> 44:10.870
Ziggy says wherever the baby's
coming, it'll be in four minute

44:10.870 --> 44:13.664
Where's my father?
Effy's looking for him, honey.

44:13.664 --> 44:16.208
I'm not gonna have this baby until
my father gets here!

44:16.208 --> 44:18.336
You don't have a choice.

44:18.336 --> 44:20.212
Hang on, honey!

44:20.212 --> 44:22.256
Billie?

44:22.256 --> 44:24.341
Daddy?
Billie!

44:24.341 --> 44:25.801
Dad.

44:25.801 --> 44:28.763
Everything's gonna be all right.
Everything's gonna be OK.

44:28.763 --> 44:30.973
The baby... I want...

44:30.973 --> 44:34.477
She wants to keep the baby, Bob.
She's been saying that for days.

44:34.477 --> 44:37.146
Let's not argue about that now,
sweetheart.

44:37.146 --> 44:39.982
Sam, there's a little problem
in the waiting room.

44:39.982 --> 44:41.901
What?
(GROANS)

44:41.901 --> 44:45.321
The baby has disappeared
from Billie Jean's womb.

44:45.321 --> 44:48.157
I knew it, I knew it!
I'm having this baby!

44:48.157 --> 44:50.242
That's the idea, Billie Jean.

44:53.454 --> 44:55.581
Here we go. One, two...

44:55.581 --> 44:57.625
(GROANS)

44:59.627 --> 45:02.463
Will you get outta here?!
No! No!

45:02.463 --> 45:05.424
You have to help me...keep the baby.

45:05.424 --> 45:10.179
Billie, it ain't right!
For God's sake, Bob.
She's your only daughter!

45:10.179 --> 45:12.264
All right. All right, Billie.

45:12.264 --> 45:15.226
You get through this OK,
we'll do anything you wanna do.

45:15.226 --> 45:17.353
Oh, hallelujah!
I love you.

45:20.231 --> 45:21.732
Al!

45:23.651 --> 45:25.486
Get it out!

45:25.486 --> 45:27.613
Get it out!

45:27.613 --> 45:29.740
Take it easy, Sam.
 Everything's OK.

45:29.740 --> 45:31.909
Bob marries Dotty

45:31.909 --> 45:34.286
and they help Billie Jean
raise the baby.

45:34.286 --> 45:36.497
You've done it. You've done it!

45:36.497 --> 45:38.707
I see a head.
She's trying to get out.

45:38.707 --> 45:40.751
Give a push!

45:59.979 --> 46:01.939
Activate the time machine.

46:04.024 --> 46:06.735
Stand by the time accelerator.

46:09.071 --> 46:11.198
Uh...uh...

46:11.198 --> 46:13.325
standing...by.

46:13.325 --> 46:15.452
Activate...now!

46:25.671 --> 46:27.715
Oh, boy.
