OPTIMUS: Good work, Rhinox.

00:52.241 --> 00:55.174
Well. Still needs a field test.

00:55.274 --> 00:57.975
Test?

00:58.075 --> 01:00.175
I'm your bot. Whatcha got?

01:00.275 --> 01:03.443
Rhinox cobbled together a new com-link. It's going to solve

01:03.543 --> 01:06.243
our long-range communication problems.

01:06.343 --> 01:07.543
If it works.

01:07.643 --> 01:09.311
CHEETOR: Well, let's find out.

01:11.811 --> 01:13.344
( sniffs )

01:13.444 --> 01:15.711
Whoa. Ultra gear.

01:18.645 --> 01:21.846
Cheetor, it's a valuable piece of equipment.

01:21.946 --> 01:23.580
Take care of it.

01:23.680 --> 01:25.213
I copy, big bot.

01:25.313 --> 01:26.613
What do I do?

01:26.713 --> 01:28.847
The device is voice-activated.

01:28.947 --> 01:30.914
Just talk into it and we'll hear you.

01:31.015 --> 01:32.581
We hope.

01:36.482 --> 01:38.548
Head away from the base at Vector Omega,

01:38.648 --> 01:40.915
and check in every 10 micro-quads.

01:41.015 --> 01:42.649
We'll see how far we can track you.

01:42.750 --> 01:46.150
If you encounter any Predacons, return immediately.

01:46.250 --> 01:48.584
I'll be moving too fast for them to see me.

01:48.684 --> 01:50.118

Mm-mm-mm.

Ah!

Scorponok, terrorize!

( thunder rumbling )

02:37.258 --> 02:38.259
( beeps )

02:38.358 --> 02:40.526
Cheetor to Optimus. Do you read me?

02:40.626 --> 02:41.793
Yes.

02:41.892 --> 02:44.160
And he's over five micro-quads away.

02:44.260 --> 02:45.860
Looks like it's working.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.627
So far.

02:47.727 --> 02:49.494
CHEETOR: Just heard some kind of explosion.

02:49.594 --> 02:51.494
I'm gonna check it out. I'll talk to you in a minute.

02:51.594 --> 02:54.728
Explosion? Wait. Cheetor. Don't!

02:54.828 --> 02:57.661
He's moving again.

02:57.762 --> 02:59.028
( sighs )

02:59.129 --> 03:00.295
I'm going after him.

03:00.396 --> 03:04.130
If he calls in, tell him to get out of there. Now!

03:13.398 --> 03:14.965
( grunts )

03:19.032 --> 03:21.032
Uh-oh. This is trouble.

03:21.133 --> 03:24.166
Cheetor, maximize.

03:27.401 --> 03:29.401
( beeps ) Cheetor to Optimus.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.367
RHINOX: Optimus is on his way.

03:31.467 --> 03:33.601
He said you should get out of there.

03:33.701 --> 03:35.301
CHEETOR: No can do, baby blue.

03:35.402 --> 03:37.935
Scorponok's here and he's found a mega-cannon.

03:38.036 --> 03:39.502
Must've come from their ship.

03:39.602 --> 03:41.902
I've gotta stop him before he gets it back to their base.

03:42.002 --> 03:44.770
Cheetor out.

03:44.870 --> 03:48.237
Mm. Still operational.

03:48.337 --> 03:51.338
Megatron will be pleased.

03:51.437 --> 03:55.738
You'll be slag if you don't stay right where you are, Clawful.

03:59.272 --> 04:01.406
Clicking makes me twitch.

04:01.506 --> 04:04.340
And there's a full charge in this beauty.

04:06.407 --> 04:10.874
Uh-ah. Away from the big boomer, plug ugly.

04:11.907 --> 04:13.141
( beeps )

04:13.241 --> 04:15.641
Cheetor to base. I got the gig in hand.

04:15.741 --> 04:19.375
Tell Optimus to home in on my signal.

04:19.475 --> 04:20.876
Cheetor to base.

04:20.976 --> 04:22.376
Come in Rhinox.

04:23.610 --> 04:27.244
Uh-uh-ah. You're making me twitch again.

04:27.344 --> 04:29.977
And I'll make you scream.

04:30.077 --> 04:31.577

04:40.379 --> 04:42.379
Yes!

04:42.479 --> 04:44.679
TARANTULAS: Better grab that weapon while you can,

04:44.780 --> 04:48.747
and give it back to base. Optimus is coming.

04:52.081 --> 04:55.681
Don't give me orders. I'm second in command.

04:55.782 --> 04:59.115
You will take the cannon back and I will see to Optimus.

04:59.215 --> 05:00.682
You hear me?

05:00.783 --> 05:01.949
Tarantulas?

05:14.751 --> 05:16.152
His signal stopped.

05:16.252 --> 05:17.918
Could be energon interference.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.652
Better use scan mode.

07:52.477 --> 07:55.845
There. Good as new.

07:55.945 --> 07:59.778
Yeah. And twice as loud. Ow.

08:01.612 --> 08:04.313
Hey, big bot,

08:04.412 --> 08:05.913
what happened out there?

08:06.013 --> 08:07.280
( spits )

08:07.380 --> 08:09.513
You took a Predacon missile right in the chest plate.

08:09.613 --> 08:12.514
Guess you aren't as fast as you thought, huh, kiddo?

08:12.614 --> 08:15.548
And you got my com-link trashed.

08:15.648 --> 08:18.782
Hey, at least I proved it worked.

08:18.881 --> 08:22.615
Rhinox said you reported something about a mega-cannon.

08:22.715 --> 08:25.850
That's right. It must've blown off their ship in the crash.

08:25.950 --> 08:29.817
Scorponok found it so I catted in and got the drop on him.

08:29.917 --> 08:31.384
( spitting )

08:31.484 --> 08:34.451
I'd, uh, say that you were the one that got dropped.

08:34.551 --> 08:36.618
Hey. Tarantulas was there too.

08:36.718 --> 08:38.118
He got behind me,

08:38.218 --> 08:39.518
and when I tried to take him out--

08:39.618 --> 08:42.952
Scorponok capitalized on your mistake.

08:43.052 --> 08:46.619
Yeah. I guess so.

08:46.719 --> 08:49.187
Rhinox worked on that com-link for a month,

08:49.287 --> 08:52.121
and he doesn't have the components to build another one.

08:52.221 --> 08:54.388
You've cost us an advantage.

08:54.488 --> 08:56.321
I couldn't let him get away with that cannon.

08:56.421 --> 09:00.622
Oh, yeah. You took care of that real good, kiddo.

09:00.722 --> 09:02.189
( chuckling )

09:02.289 --> 09:04.556
Back off, rat face.

09:06.256 --> 09:09.290
Or I'll have a little vermin on a stick for lunch.

09:09.390 --> 09:10.723
( growls )

09:10.824 --> 09:13.391
You back off. Now!

09:13.491 --> 09:14.758
Sorry, Optimus, I...

09:14.858 --> 09:16.458
Sorry isn't enough.

09:16.558 --> 09:19.692
We're in a war for survival and you treat it like a game.

09:19.792 --> 09:23.526
If you had obeyed orders, all this could've been avoided.

09:23.625 --> 09:26.126
I'm going to call Dinobot in from the perimeter.

09:26.226 --> 09:27.927
We'll need his knowledge of the Predacon base

09:28.027 --> 09:30.427
to do something about that mega-cannon.

09:30.527 --> 09:31.993
I can get inside their base.

09:32.093 --> 09:33.727
Let me do it, Optimus.

09:33.828 --> 09:36.794
You've done enough.

09:38.462 --> 09:40.728
I better come up with a plan.

09:40.829 --> 09:43.296
If I know Optimus, he'll want to move fast.

09:43.396 --> 09:47.197
Yeah. With me in front. No thanks, partner.

09:47.297 --> 09:49.063
The pussycat got us into hot oil.

09:49.163 --> 09:52.797
Let him dance into Predacon H.Q.

09:52.897 --> 09:55.231
At least I'm not afraid to do it.

09:55.331 --> 09:58.398
You know, that is why you mess up, kiddo.

09:58.498 --> 10:01.032
You don't have the sense to be afraid.

10:01.132 --> 10:04.999
Oh, yeah? I'll show you what I have the sense to do, motorhead.

10:05.099 --> 10:06.699
You and big bot.

10:09.733 --> 10:12.000
Mm-mm-mm.

10:12.101 --> 10:13.734
What?

10:13.835 --> 10:15.501
You know what he's gonna do.

10:15.601 --> 10:18.268
Nah, he's just grindin' his gears.

10:18.368 --> 10:22.635
Even he's not dumb enough to disobey the great Optimus again.

10:22.735 --> 10:24.303
Uh-huh.

10:24.403 --> 10:26.403
( sighs )

10:26.503 --> 10:29.103
Okay, okay, okay. I'll stop him.

10:29.204 --> 10:31.404
If I can catch him.

10:31.504 --> 10:35.305
Sheesh. That rotten little guy.

10:35.405 --> 10:37.405
( tense theme playing )

10:54.074 --> 10:56.842
Gotta move quickly.

11:03.442 --> 11:08.310
All I have to do now is wait for the right moment.

11:08.410 --> 11:10.577

11:15.444 --> 11:17.611

11:48.950 --> 11:51.450
Welcome.

11:51.550 --> 11:56.852
Oh, brother. You need a maintenance bot badly.

11:56.952 --> 11:58.952
( chuckling )

12:01.419 --> 12:03.953
( groans )

12:04.053 --> 12:05.953
You're in a stasis web.

12:06.053 --> 12:08.453
It drains away the energy

12:08.553 --> 12:11.820
but leaves the flesh alive.

12:11.920 --> 12:15.154
At its current setting, this will take only a few moments.

12:15.254 --> 12:17.255
( laughing )

12:17.355 --> 12:19.722
But I find a slower pace

12:19.821 --> 12:24.755
makes the vital fluids taste so much better.

12:24.856 --> 12:25.822
( gasps )

12:25.922 --> 12:29.957
Whoa! You are one space-happy spider.

12:30.057 --> 12:33.958
Cheetor, maximize!

12:34.058 --> 12:37.625
I'm afraid the web makes that impossible.

12:37.725 --> 12:40.492
Cat you are and cat you stay.

12:40.592 --> 12:42.825
And when your energy's gone...

12:42.925 --> 12:45.826
I feast.

12:45.926 --> 12:47.926
( laughing )

12:53.760 --> 12:55.760
( dramatic theme playing )

13:05.296 --> 13:07.463
Frontal assault, now.

13:07.563 --> 13:11.396
Before Megatron has a chance to use the cannon against us.

13:11.497 --> 13:12.730
Impossible.

13:12.830 --> 13:15.364
The modifications would be too extensive.

13:15.464 --> 13:18.298
He's more likely to emplace it as a defensive weapon.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.232
Question is...

13:20.332 --> 13:21.665
where?

13:21.765 --> 13:24.866
Rhinox, this is your specialty. Take a look.

13:24.966 --> 13:26.666
And where's Rattrap?

13:26.766 --> 13:28.366
I'll need him to scout.

13:28.466 --> 13:31.367
Um, still talking to Cheetor.

13:31.467 --> 13:32.567
( groans )

13:32.667 --> 13:34.734
We waste too much time talking.

13:34.834 --> 13:36.401
We must act.

13:36.502 --> 13:38.235
Rushing in headlong won't help.

13:38.335 --> 13:42.469
No, no, no! Destroy them!

13:59.205 --> 14:00.505
Man, oh, man.

14:00.605 --> 14:03.472
I must have a bug in my program to be doing this

14:03.572 --> 14:06.340
for that dumb feline.

14:10.540 --> 14:13.407
( sniffs )

14:13.508 --> 14:17.441
I can smell his stink even in this sludge box.

14:17.541 --> 14:19.908
( sniffs )

14:20.008 --> 14:23.809
Hey, something's weird here.

14:32.077 --> 14:34.277
Not long now.

14:34.377 --> 14:36.011
( laughing )

14:36.111 --> 14:39.545
This is a dumb plan, web face.

14:39.645 --> 14:41.411
I don't have any real blood.

14:41.512 --> 14:43.045
Just mech fluid.

14:43.145 --> 14:45.813
Oh, my filters will adjust.

14:45.913 --> 14:49.580
It is the act I enjoy more than the nourishment.

14:49.679 --> 14:52.647
You know, you are one sick bug, eight eyes.

14:52.747 --> 14:54.248
( screams )

14:54.348 --> 14:55.780
The rat!

14:55.881 --> 14:58.081
Heh, heh. You got it.

14:58.181 --> 15:00.615
Now, what do you say you let my pal go?

15:00.715 --> 15:04.749
Tarantulas, terrorize!

15:04.849 --> 15:08.450
Rattrap, maximize!

15:08.550 --> 15:11.084
( action theme playing )

15:21.418 --> 15:22.852
( grunts )

15:32.087 --> 15:35.420
Now he'll have you for lunch, web breath.

15:35.521 --> 15:37.255
( cackles )

15:39.655 --> 15:41.555
( coughs )

15:42.722 --> 15:45.956
A thermal scan.

15:52.757 --> 15:54.291
No!

15:56.791 --> 15:58.191
( grunts )

15:58.291 --> 15:59.691
Hmm...

You know, Cheetor needed some activity.

I shouldn't have been so harsh.

your little play date with Tarantulas,
