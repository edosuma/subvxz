    Dad, I already told you.
This isn't a spring break trip.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.420
       It's a field trip
      for Miss Goldstein's

       it is meaningless.

    said we would pay for it

        you didn't get,

05:16.550 --> 05:20.786

16:45.638 --> 16:49.340
  Yes. This thing bled me dry.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.275
      I just wish I hadn't
     paid for three years'

16:51.277 --> 16:53.011

16:53.013 --> 16:54.746
   Not fiscally responsible.

16:54.748 --> 16:56.180
          Sorry, man.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.216
  I tried everything, Wheels.

16:58.218 --> 17:01.319
   I even put in fog machine
        for party times!

17:01.321 --> 17:03.221
          Party times?

17:03.223 --> 17:07.592
     Yeah, but I'm cutting
     my losses, moving on.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.627
   I've got big score I find
   that's happening tonight,

17:09.628 --> 17:12.696
       and I need driver
          I can trust.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.598
              Ehh.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.567
        That's what you
      called me here for?

17:16.569 --> 17:19.137
      Yes. What you think,
      I want to catch up?

17:19.138 --> 17:21.638
        I'm not a driver
       anymore, remember?

17:21.641 --> 17:23.540
    Besides, I don't want to
   watch my daughter grow up

17:23.542 --> 17:25.108
       from a jail cell.

17:25.111 --> 17:27.712
          I don't care
    about your stupid baby.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.714
      I'm not your errand
       boy anymore, Ari.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.315
   Good luck with your rink.

17:33.520 --> 17:37.188
      I imagine not a lot
   of legit work for ex-con.

17:38.725 --> 17:42.093

   long way for little Sofia.

17:46.599 --> 17:48.800
     [Goldstein] OK. I have
    the keys for our rooms.

17:48.802 --> 17:50.334
           Stay back!

17:50.336 --> 17:52.570
           Stay back,
    you animals, stay back!

17:52.572 --> 17:54.405
    Everybody's gonna shit.

17:54.407 --> 17:57.341
  Just wait. Nobody's leaving
      their room tonight,

17:57.343 --> 17:59.444
  and there are no exceptions.
I don't care if there's a fire,

17:59.446 --> 18:01.245
    I don't care if there's
         an earthquake,

18:01.247 --> 18:03.181
  I don't care if aliens come
       down to invade us,

18:03.183 --> 18:04.382
I don't care if there's a ghost
   in the hallway screaming,

18:04.384 --> 18:05.750
      "Help me, help me,"

18:05.752 --> 18:07.218
      and then he gets in
        and he kills you

18:07.220 --> 18:08.753
    and you become a ghost.

18:08.755 --> 18:12.723
    You as a ghost will not
     be leaving the rooms.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.625

       with your brother.

18:14.627 --> 18:17.528
    -We're switching rooms.
   -Chad, you're with Jesse.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.697
     You two are together,
   and, Bear, you're with me.

18:19.699 --> 18:22.767
         Hey. We'll get
     through this together.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.338
              No.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.610
       Ahh. You ever here
       of, uh, Van Gogh?

18:32.612 --> 18:35.246
   Yeah, of course. The, uh,
   Dutch post impressionist.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.482
       I have line on one
   of his missing paintings.

18:37.484 --> 18:40.118
   I think it's called <i> Boy,</i>
   uh, <i> Pissing on Sunflowers</i>

18:40.120 --> 18:41.385
         or something.

18:41.387 --> 18:42.787
   Pretty sure that's not it.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.622
         I don't know.
      I'm not homosexual.

18:44.624 --> 18:49.627
  Anyway, I know where it is,
        and I have buyer

18:49.629 --> 18:53.664
   willing to pay two million
      for it cash tonight.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.566
       It's just sitting
        in some old safe

18:55.568 --> 18:58.903
 in some real estate company's
     liquidation facility,

18:58.905 --> 19:00.738
     which is why I'm going
         to swap it out

19:00.740 --> 19:04.909
     with replica tonight.

19:04.911 --> 19:08.146
   OK. Are you sure these two
     are the stealthy team

19:08.148 --> 19:10.882
     -you want on this job?
           -You nuts?

19:10.884 --> 19:13.551
 I hire couple of pros on this,
      the same ones who do

19:13.553 --> 19:16.888
        the museum heist
  in Amsterdam broad daylight,

19:16.890 --> 19:19.190
 dressed as tourists, you know?

19:19.192 --> 19:20.591
 Oh, I think I read about them.

19:20.593 --> 19:23.528
    Anyway, Ari reaches out,
         they say yes.

19:23.530 --> 19:26.497
   All you got to do is pick
   them up, make a few stops,

19:26.499 --> 19:28.432
      wait for them while
        they do the job,

19:28.434 --> 19:31.869
and make sure you get back here
   before my buyer gets here.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.539
     You get hundred large,
    I get to start new life

19:34.541 --> 19:37.175
           in Brazil!

19:37.177 --> 19:38.743
          Why Brazil?

19:38.745 --> 19:40.611
 Very loose banking regulations

19:40.613 --> 19:43.781
      and fastest growing
    recreational activity--

19:43.783 --> 19:45.550
        roller skating.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.418
I'm going to take the money and
        build new rink,

19:53.560 --> 19:55.826

20:01.234 --> 20:02.433
           - I'm in.
             - Yes!

20:02.435 --> 20:03.634

      at the Crest Motel.

20:09.342 --> 20:10.708
     They are under names,

20:10.710 --> 20:12.610
  uh, Monarch and "Wis-a-roy,"
            I think.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.445
           - Viceroy.
         - Wheels, go!

20:14.447 --> 20:15.913
   They're expecting you. Go!

20:15.915 --> 20:17.648
           All right,
    but this is my last job.

20:17.650 --> 20:20.785

     number and my e-mail.

   to follow me on Instagram.

   Keep mouth shut and drive.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.471
        What's up, boss?

20:40.473 --> 20:43.441
   Make sure everything goes
    exactly as planned, OK?

20:43.443 --> 20:44.675
             Yeah.

20:44.677 --> 20:46.377
Anything goes wrong, kill them,

20:46.379 --> 20:50.248
     and before you leave,
         polish these.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.683
      Polish, not Polish.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.285
         Polish these.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.592
       This isn't so bad.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.394
    At least we're not sick.

21:03.396 --> 21:06.664
          Heh. Funny.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.666
        You want to use
         the bathroom?

21:08.668 --> 21:10.034
           I'm done.

21:10.036 --> 21:11.569
        Nope. I'm good.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.537
        You're not gonna
       get ready for bed?

21:13.539 --> 21:15.906
  What do you mean? What do I
have to do to get ready for bed?

21:15.908 --> 21:17.441
          I'm in bed.

21:17.443 --> 21:20.611
    OK. What's up with you?

21:20.613 --> 21:23.681
       I don't think I'm
      gonna go to college.

21:23.683 --> 21:26.484
        Are you serious?
            Why not?

21:26.486 --> 21:27.985
       I mean, I've been
       thinking about it,

21:27.987 --> 21:30.388
     and I don't even know
       what I want to do

21:30.390 --> 21:32.990
  with my life yet, so why not
   just take a few years off

21:32.992 --> 21:34.925
and travel abroad or something?

21:34.927 --> 21:36.961
   Kate, everybody knows that
   take a couple years off to

21:36.963 --> 21:39.397
   travel abroad really just
   means going and get drunk

21:39.399 --> 21:41.299
    and hook up with a bunch
       of foreign dudes.

21:41.301 --> 21:43.601
    You're better than that,
    and college is all about

21:43.603 --> 21:45.970
 where you figure out what you
   want to do with your life.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.306
You're just so lucky you already
   know what you want to do.

21:48.308 --> 21:49.573
     You're gonna be, like,
   the first female president

21:49.575 --> 21:51.075
     one day or something.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.544
         Hopefully not.
   There are currently a lot

21:53.546 --> 21:55.079
       of qualified women
      serving in Congress.

21:55.081 --> 21:56.480
          I'm hungry.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.649
Me, too. Want to order a pizza?

21:58.651 --> 22:00.351
       No. I want to get
          out of here,

22:00.353 --> 22:03.954
        and I want to go
     somewhere nice, and...

22:03.956 --> 22:05.756
  it's gonna be on my parents.

22:05.758 --> 22:08.092
           - Really?
           - Why not?

22:08.094 --> 22:09.994
    I mean--OK, technically,
     it is for emergencies,

22:09.996 --> 22:12.730
  but seriously, if this isn't
     an emergency, what is?

22:12.732 --> 22:14.031
  How are we gonna get there?

22:14.033 --> 22:16.400
   I'll just order us a ride.

22:16.402 --> 22:18.869
  I'll even say our names are
      Viceroy and Monarch

22:18.871 --> 22:20.404
     like the butterflies,
        not the hookers.

22:20.406 --> 22:22.340
        Hold on. What if
         we get caught?

22:22.342 --> 22:24.408
  We're not gonna get caught.
   I'm not gonna tell anyone,

22:24.410 --> 22:26.644
      and you're not gonna
          tell anyone.

22:26.646 --> 22:28.879
         My clothes are
       covered in vomit.

22:28.881 --> 22:31.882
       I guess that means
          we should go

22:31.884 --> 22:33.584
       to a thrift store.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.553
      OK. That is actually
       such a good idea.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.455
        We haven't done
        that in so long.

22:37.457 --> 22:39.824
See? We'll just go really quick,
    we'll have a nice dinner

22:39.826 --> 22:41.759
  and some new fresh clothes,
           come back,

22:41.761 --> 22:43.561
      and no one will even
       know we were gone.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.596
      Well, I did find one
       that's still open.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.932
      And there's already
       a ride on its way.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.633
        We have to be so
    careful leaving, though.

22:49.635 --> 22:51.969
   If Miss Goldstein sees us,
         we're screwed.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.904

   we have anything to worry

22:53.906 --> 22:56.674

  or anyone else here tonight.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.495
 Let's go over the plan again.

23:17.497 --> 23:18.629
 - I downloaded the building--
         - Don't worry.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.398
          We got this.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.400
   Ari's gonna lead us right
       to The Collector.

23:22.402 --> 23:23.868

              Yep.

23:37.550 --> 23:38.816

  That's rule number one, OK?

24:54.961 --> 24:56.861
       OK. There's rules.

24:56.863 --> 24:58.729
  I love that. That's awesome.

24:58.731 --> 25:00.731
      What is, uh--what's
        rule number two?

25:00.733 --> 25:02.233
      Don't ask questions.

25:02.235 --> 25:03.801
      As you can imagine,
    discretion's a big part

25:03.803 --> 25:05.002
         of what we do.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.504
     Oh, yeah. I get that.

25:06.506 --> 25:08.005
         Yes, I totally
        get--I get that.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.206
      I get what she said.

25:09.208 --> 25:10.741
    I like it. I'm into it.

25:10.743 --> 25:12.042
           Ha ha ha!

25:12.044 --> 25:13.511
  Yeah. I love to be discreet.

25:13.513 --> 25:15.112
       I get that a lot.

25:15.114 --> 25:17.681
    My friends are all just
   like--I'm crazy discreet.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.783
 Is there a rule number three?

25:19.785 --> 25:21.552
          Yeah. Drive.

25:23.823 --> 25:26.757
  I cannot believe I actually
  just got you out right now.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.292
     Calm down. I can make
     him turn around still.

25:28.294 --> 25:30.628
         No, you can't.
      We're not going to,

25:30.630 --> 25:32.763
       and plus, this car
    is actually pretty sick.

25:32.765 --> 25:35.933
      Yo, sick car, dude.

25:35.935 --> 25:38.736
           All right.
    So, uh, where we going?

25:38.738 --> 25:41.772
     Oh. Um, could you take
        us here, please?

25:44.043 --> 25:45.876
      Yeah. What's there?

25:45.878 --> 25:47.845
     Let's just say we have
    to settle an old score.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.783
    [Brian] So I got water,
          I got mints,

25:52.785 --> 25:55.252
      I got breath strips,
  I got a really sick Spotify

25:55.254 --> 25:56.921
    if you guys like music.

25:56.923 --> 25:59.256
    Anything you guys want,
       just let me know.

25:59.258 --> 26:01.191
    I'm here to please you--
      or please, you know?

26:01.193 --> 26:04.161
       Thanks. No water.
   Just drive and don't talk.

26:04.163 --> 26:05.963
     OK. Cool, cool, cool.

26:05.965 --> 26:07.731
    So where you guys from?

26:07.733 --> 26:10.267
        In town on, uh,
     business or pleasure?

26:10.269 --> 26:13.037
      Or I guess pleasure
    is your business, right?

26:13.039 --> 26:14.305
           Ha ha ha!

26:14.307 --> 26:15.839
             What?

26:15.841 --> 26:17.341
       Nothing. Nothing.
        I'm--I'm sorry.

26:17.343 --> 26:19.643
       I should--I--what
      am I--listen to me.

26:19.645 --> 26:22.012
    I'm asking--I ask a lot
     of questions sometimes

26:22.014 --> 26:23.914
 when I get nervous, you know?

26:23.916 --> 26:25.849
     Not that I'm nervous.
 I'm calm, you know, I'm cool.

26:25.851 --> 26:27.952
  My friends are always like,
   "Oh, Brian, he's so cool.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.687
    You got to meet Brian."

26:29.689 --> 26:31.355
 So, like, don't even sweat it,
           you know?

26:31.357 --> 26:33.190
     It's just I'm saying--
  I'm saying I'm open-minded.

26:33.192 --> 26:35.225
   So anything you guys want,
       just let me know.

26:35.227 --> 26:36.860
    Look. Just do your job.

26:36.862 --> 26:38.596
     No one will get hurt.

26:38.598 --> 26:40.297
          OK. Got it.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.202
   I'm gonna text Ari and let
    him know we're in play.

26:45.204 --> 26:47.171
       Yeah, and tell him
     the driver's annoying.

26:47.173 --> 26:48.872
        Driver. Are you
       guys talking golf?

26:51.711 --> 26:53.711
      [cell phone chiming]

26:57.049 --> 26:59.617
              Heh.

26:59.619 --> 27:01.385
        Yes. Here we go.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.195
        That's the spot.

27:11.197 --> 27:13.130
       I'll be right here
        when you get out

27:13.132 --> 27:14.865
   unless you want me to wait
       in the back alley.

27:14.867 --> 27:16.400
   No. It's OK. This is fine.

27:16.402 --> 27:18.102
        [Kate] You sure
        want to do this?

27:18.104 --> 27:20.170
      Once we go in there,
    there's no turning back.

27:20.172 --> 27:21.905
          - I'm sure.
          - Oh, yeah?

27:21.907 --> 27:23.240
            - Yeah.
          - Oh, yeah?

27:23.242 --> 27:24.942
            - Yeah.
          - Oh, yeah?

27:24.944 --> 27:26.777
            - Yeah.
          - Oh, yeah?

27:26.779 --> 27:27.945
            - Yeah.
            - Yeah?

27:27.947 --> 27:29.680
           - Mm-hmm.
            - Yeah?

27:29.682 --> 27:31.048
            - Yeah.
            - Yeah?

27:31.050 --> 27:32.950
            - Yeah.
          - Oh, yeah?

27:32.952 --> 27:34.118
           I mean...

27:34.120 --> 27:35.653
          [both] Yeah!

27:52.905 --> 27:54.405
 [Abby] Now remember the rules.

27:54.407 --> 27:56.840
      I'll whatever outfit
    you pick just as long as

27:56.842 --> 27:58.442
 it's not too slutty or dirty.

27:58.444 --> 27:59.910
    You can't tell everyone
        it's a joke like

27:59.912 --> 28:01.111
       you did last time.

28:01.113 --> 28:02.813
        That's cheating.

28:02.815 --> 28:04.048
     OK. It's not cheating
       if it's the cops.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.315
   First one to break loses.

28:05.317 --> 28:06.684
            - Deal?
            - Deal.

         What the hell

28:35.815 --> 28:37.981
        It's so obvious.

28:37.983 --> 28:39.883
   They're buying disguises.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.719
        Check this out.

28:41.721 --> 28:43.987
   Says right here they were
     dressed up last time.

28:43.989 --> 28:45.456
   Right, man, but the point
     is we could have done

28:45.458 --> 28:46.924
      this job ourselves.

28:46.926 --> 28:48.759
         Uh-huh. Look.

28:48.761 --> 28:52.329
       They were orphans
     trained by the Yakuza.

28:52.331 --> 28:53.497
      Sounds about right.

28:53.499 --> 28:54.898
             Yeah.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.233
            - Right?
            - Yeah.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.302
   Everything on the Internet
            is true.

29:11.117 --> 29:13.317
          Is this it?
    I think that this is it.

29:13.319 --> 29:15.986
    This is fine. Just wait
    for us here, all right?

29:15.988 --> 29:18.789
 OK. Well, I mean, this doesn't
 look like a safe neighborhood.

29:18.791 --> 29:20.324
     Are you sure you girls
        are gonna be OK?

29:20.326 --> 29:22.359
     What did we say about
       asking questions?

29:22.361 --> 29:24.928
         Oh. Uh, what--
       I don't remember.

29:24.930 --> 29:27.231
         - What was it?
    - It's safe, I promise.

29:27.233 --> 29:28.465
     Just stay in the car,
     don't talk to anybody.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.100
We'll be back in a few minutes.

29:30.102 --> 29:32.102
[Brian] Uh, sorry. Can I use my
             phone?

29:32.104 --> 29:33.871
            - Sure.
             - No.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.272
 [Brian] I just want to talk to
         some buddies.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.174
    Tomorrow, me and a bunch
         of my friends,

29:37.176 --> 29:39.109
     we're going skydiving,
 which I'm pretty jazzed about

29:39.111 --> 29:40.344
        because I love,
      like, extreme stuff.

29:40.346 --> 29:42.045
  I'm, like, live on the edge.

29:42.047 --> 29:44.448
         I'm just like
   an extremist--sportswise,

29:44.450 --> 29:45.883
        not politically.

29:45.885 --> 29:47.351
      I--all right, girls.

29:56.028 --> 29:57.561
           All right.
     Let me do the talking.

29:57.563 --> 29:58.962
              OK.

30:04.870 --> 30:06.203
              Da?

30:06.205 --> 30:09.273
         We're here to
        see The Painter.

30:09.275 --> 30:11.909
             Nyet.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.243
           Good job.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.221
         - Oh, come on.
          - Too slow.

30:40.973 --> 30:44.074
 What in the good Lord's name?

30:44.076 --> 30:46.009
        [Kate] You have
      never looked better.

30:46.011 --> 30:48.278
    I would totally hire you
   to be my personal trainer.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.180
     Mmm. I think I'm more
        of a life coach,

30:50.182 --> 30:51.448
         but thank you.

30:51.450 --> 30:53.116
   I would totally marry you.

30:53.118 --> 30:54.918
      Let's see how dinner
       goes first, honey.

31:01.861 --> 31:03.961
  Hey. Sorry it took so long.

31:03.963 --> 31:05.996
          No worries.
       Get what you need?

31:05.998 --> 31:07.364
       Yeah. We think so.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.066
       What do you think?

31:09.068 --> 31:10.400
         I don't know.

31:10.402 --> 31:12.102
   Come on. You can tell us.

31:12.104 --> 31:14.104
        We look awesome.

31:14.106 --> 31:15.372
         Where to next?

31:19.044 --> 31:21.144
          - I had it.
   - Yeah, I'm sure you did.

31:21.146 --> 31:22.646
      You can't just break
         someone's nose

31:22.648 --> 31:24.514
      every time something
      doesn't go your way.

31:24.516 --> 31:25.983
 Somebody could have seen that
      and called the cops.

31:25.985 --> 31:27.117
I told you, I'm more than happy

31:27.119 --> 31:28.252
    to teach you some moves.

31:28.254 --> 31:29.620
      It's not that hard.

31:29.622 --> 31:31.054
      I know how to fight.
        I prefer not to.

31:31.056 --> 31:32.556
            Boring.

31:34.894 --> 31:37.094
       Master, somebody's
        here to see you.

31:39.064 --> 31:40.430
          Is he dead?

31:40.432 --> 31:43.300
        [man] No. The--
    The Painter is resting.

31:43.302 --> 31:46.036
       The Painter smells
        like he's dead.

31:46.038 --> 31:47.504
          "Kreh-tos"?

31:47.506 --> 31:49.139
        "Krah-tos," sir.
     We've talked about it.

31:49.141 --> 31:50.974
          - Kreh-tos--
          - Krah-tos.

31:50.976 --> 31:53.143
          - Kreh-tos.
          - Krah-tos.

31:53.145 --> 31:55.279
      Kray-ah-tos. Say it.
          You say it.

31:55.281 --> 31:57.114
           -Krah-tos.
         -Kray-ah-tos.

31:57.116 --> 31:58.949
      We said the exact--
  it sounds exactly the same.

31:58.951 --> 32:00.484
            No. Ah.

32:00.486 --> 32:02.052
       It doesn't matter,
     and didn't I tell you

32:02.054 --> 32:03.553
not to wake me when I'm clearly
            working?

32:03.555 --> 32:06.390
      [Kratos] Sorry, sir.
    They, uh--they insisted.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.360
              Man.

32:10.362 --> 32:12.496
        You hit Kratos.

32:12.498 --> 32:15.265
         Who does that?
     He's a big teddy bear.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.534
             - Sir.
         - Ari sent us.

32:17.536 --> 32:20.003
       [The Painter] Oh.

32:20.005 --> 32:25.342
       Well, well, well,
    well, well, well, well.

32:25.344 --> 32:29.379
       Well, well, well,
       well, well, well.

32:29.381 --> 32:33.216
          Well, well,
       well, well, well.

32:33.218 --> 32:38.288
    Well, well, well, well.

32:38.290 --> 32:44.328
       Well, if it isn't
   Viceroy and the other one.

32:44.330 --> 32:46.129
        It's a delight.

32:54.440 --> 32:57.341
              Hi.

32:57.343 --> 33:00.110
      Yes. May I help you?

33:00.112 --> 33:02.179
 [Abby] Table for two, please.

33:02.181 --> 33:03.680
   Do you have a reservation?

33:06.151 --> 33:08.285
         Right. I see.

33:08.287 --> 33:13.991
      Well, I wish we had
    a table for you, but...

33:13.993 --> 33:15.392
           I do not.

33:17.363 --> 33:19.529
 Did you just say, "I do not"?

33:19.531 --> 33:21.331
      Oh, my--oh, my God.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.766
      That's exactly what
   Jason said at my wedding!

33:22.768 --> 33:24.401
     "I do not, I do not"!

33:24.403 --> 33:27.671
              Aah!

33:27.673 --> 33:29.272
         My meatballs.

33:29.274 --> 33:32.175

33:34.413 --> 33:36.313
         You know what?
    They can have our table.

33:36.315 --> 33:37.614
        We'll come back
         another night.

      [The Painter grunts]

33:47.126 --> 33:48.692

33:50.129 --> 33:52.429

             Whoa.

33:56.068 --> 34:01.304
 What you guys did in Amsterdam
      was just next level.

34:01.306 --> 34:03.774
           Thank you.
      It was all my idea.

34:03.776 --> 34:05.776
    Oh, yeah? I don't care.

34:05.778 --> 34:07.778
           [Monarch]
     So what is this place?

34:07.780 --> 34:11.281
 I mean, the money you charge,
   and this is how you live?

34:11.283 --> 34:14.150
    No toilets, no windows.

34:14.152 --> 34:16.353
        I got a window.

34:16.355 --> 34:18.288
    Yeah, that's a painting.

34:18.290 --> 34:20.657
   Heh. I think I would know
     the difference between

34:20.659 --> 34:24.327
    a painting and a window.

34:24.329 --> 34:27.364
        Anyway, this is
       not where I live.

34:27.366 --> 34:29.733
       This is my office.

34:29.735 --> 34:31.368
      You know, I have to
      live like an artist,

34:31.370 --> 34:33.503
       I have to breathe
        like an artist,

34:33.505 --> 34:34.804
         I have to eat
        like an artist,

34:34.806 --> 34:36.239
        I have to smell
        like an artist,

34:36.241 --> 34:37.507
     dance like an artist,

34:37.509 --> 34:39.275
      talk like an artist,

34:39.277 --> 34:41.745
do this gesture like an artist.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.612
        I can't do that
          at my house.

34:43.614 --> 34:45.215
     You know what I mean?

34:45.217 --> 34:47.717
    - I'm a method painter.
           - A what?

34:47.719 --> 34:49.753
  A method painter, you know,
      like a method actor,

34:49.755 --> 34:51.455
        except I paint.

34:51.456 --> 34:53.123
      It's pretty--I would
    get that the first time

34:53.125 --> 34:54.291
        someone said it.

34:54.293 --> 34:56.560

35:01.600 --> 35:03.200
       Yeah. I think you
      should probably see

35:03.202 --> 35:06.403
      a doctor about that.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.438
     You're kind of pretty.

35:08.440 --> 35:13.210
     I'd like to draw you,
 give you a nice pencil twirl.

35:13.212 --> 35:15.378
         You interested
       in a nude drawing?

35:15.380 --> 35:16.713
         You don't have
         to get naked.

35:16.715 --> 35:18.148
    I'll just get naked and
           draw you.

35:20.319 --> 35:23.687
           Yeah. No.

35:23.689 --> 35:25.856
        Do you have what
          we came for?

35:25.858 --> 35:28.191
             - Huh?
- Do you have what we came for?

35:28.193 --> 35:29.459
             What?

35:32.464 --> 35:36.500
  Of course. You think I don't
     have my shit together?

35:36.502 --> 35:39.569
    You know, when Ari first
   told me that he found it,

35:39.571 --> 35:41.338
   I was like, "Yeah, right."

35:41.340 --> 35:43.874

        he certainly hit

35:43.876 --> 35:45.375

    all that stuff you said.

    for all 12 hours it took

         to paint this.

36:05.397 --> 36:07.330
      Yeah. We got to go.

         Appreciate it.

    at as soon as possible.

       gonna get married.

    - Have you sent it yet?

     a period of time where

36:46.338 --> 36:47.470
    people didn't even have
      cell phones at all?

    going to have to remind

37:01.486 --> 37:04.621
  you to remove your headwear.

37:04.623 --> 37:07.691
 We do have a dress code policy
      at this restaurant.

37:07.693 --> 37:09.226
   This doesn't mean I lose.

37:09.228 --> 37:11.394

 he could have had back there?

    done then, do them all?

38:25.637 --> 38:27.804

 I can handle four, no problem.

   I mean, I know you're mad
         at your folks,

38:46.358 --> 38:48.358
   but their appetizers cost
      more than my house.

       back at the motel.

    with anything to drink?

39:38.477 --> 39:40.643

    It's been a rough week.

39:40.645 --> 39:43.913

      see some photo I.D.

    how your night is going.

       weird to be back.

40:25.724 --> 40:27.924
This is just one job, all right?

40:27.926 --> 40:30.093
     But thanks for asking,
     though, Ari, you know,

40:30.095 --> 40:31.561
   because at first I thought
   it would be kind of weird.

40:31.563 --> 40:32.962
       Wheels, get real!

40:32.964 --> 40:35.098

     about your night, OK?

   really happened yet, man.

     weird stuff actually.

     over here afterwards.

        wrong with you?

49:13.484 --> 49:16.185
 He is the worst getaway driver
        I've ever seen.

49:16.187 --> 49:18.988
       No argument here.

49:18.990 --> 49:21.324
  I wish I had my contacts in.

49:23.227 --> 49:24.493
          You're done.

49:24.495 --> 49:26.028
       Oh, it is so cool!

49:26.030 --> 49:28.164
 I love it so much. Thank you.

49:28.166 --> 49:29.565
    Oh, you are so welcome.
        It looks really,

49:29.567 --> 49:31.167
     - really good on you.
           - I know.

49:31.169 --> 49:32.401
           All right,
    Buzz Aldrin, you're up.

49:32.403 --> 49:34.103
     I don't know anymore.

49:34.105 --> 49:35.604
        What do you mean
    you don't know anymore?

49:35.606 --> 49:37.573
        We made a deal,
and I have a tattoo on my foot.

49:37.575 --> 49:40.242
   I didn't sign a contract.
 I don't want to do it anymore.

49:40.244 --> 49:41.510
  What do you mean a contract?
      We're best friends.

49:41.512 --> 49:43.045
        We don't need to
        sign a contract.

49:43.047 --> 49:44.246
    It's already engraved in
           our heart.

49:44.248 --> 49:45.514
  It's a friendship contract.

49:45.516 --> 49:47.016
            Exactly.

49:49.253 --> 49:51.354
    Fine, fine. Let's do it.

49:51.356 --> 49:52.755
           Whatever.
     I don't care anymore.

49:52.757 --> 49:54.223
        Ink me. Come on.

49:54.225 --> 49:55.491
   Ink me hard. Let's do it.

49:55.493 --> 49:57.259
        Hey! You need to
         calm down, OK?

49:57.261 --> 49:59.528
     I'm hung-over. Please.

49:59.530 --> 50:01.430
              OK.

50:01.432 --> 50:03.332
   [Viceroy] <i> Start talking.</i>

50:03.334 --> 50:06.469
        [muffled shouts]

50:06.471 --> 50:09.238
     You can probably take
   the gun out of his mouth.

50:09.240 --> 50:11.140
       What is happening?
    What are you guys doing?

50:11.142 --> 50:12.742
     Why do you have guns?
        What's going on?

50:12.744 --> 50:14.110
         Don't kill me.
     Please don't kill me.

50:14.112 --> 50:15.711
        I want to live!

50:15.713 --> 50:17.546
       I changed my mind.
        Put it back in.

50:17.548 --> 50:19.181
      Tell us everything.

50:19.183 --> 50:21.784
     I don't know anything.

50:21.786 --> 50:24.186
         Start talking.

50:24.188 --> 50:26.789
        [Brian] OK, OK.
       I have five cats.

50:26.791 --> 50:28.657
          I love them.

50:28.659 --> 50:32.361
 I also love romantic comedies
      and--and reality TV.

50:32.363 --> 50:34.130
       I binge watch it.

50:34.132 --> 50:36.799
       I find it calming,
     and-- and--and I'm not

50:36.801 --> 50:39.402
    skydiving tomorrow, OK?
       I lied about that.

50:39.404 --> 50:41.237
          I don't have
     an extreme lifestyle.

50:41.239 --> 50:42.671
      As a matter of fact,
     I would never skydive.

50:42.673 --> 50:44.440
        I hate heights,
    I don't like parachutes.

50:44.442 --> 50:46.075
   Flying makes me nauseous.

50:46.077 --> 50:48.344
     Please don't kill me.

50:48.346 --> 50:49.812
        Did Ari tell you
         to rip us off?

50:49.814 --> 50:53.049
        Who--who is Ari?

50:53.051 --> 50:54.383
   You heard of The Painter?

50:54.385 --> 50:56.318
        I know painters.

50:56.320 --> 50:59.121
          Rembrandts,
    the Ninja Turtles, sure.

50:59.123 --> 51:00.656
     [Viceroy] Wait. If you
    don't know Ari, why were

51:00.658 --> 51:02.324
    you at the Crest Motel,
      and how did you get

51:02.326 --> 51:03.726
 the names Viceroy and Monarch?

51:03.728 --> 51:06.095
         Because I had
      a pickup there, OK?

51:06.097 --> 51:08.130
       Those--those were
 the names on the pickup form.

51:08.132 --> 51:09.632
        I'm sorry I was
       two minutes late.

51:09.634 --> 51:11.734
          Pickup form?
  What are you talking about?

51:11.736 --> 51:15.104
         I am a driver
    for a rideshare company,

51:15.106 --> 51:17.373
   or at least I was a driver
    for a rideshare company

51:17.375 --> 51:19.842
    because I'm surely gonna
    get fired now if I live.

51:19.844 --> 51:21.444
       Not to mention my
     dad's gonna freak out

51:21.446 --> 51:23.212
  because this is his car, OK?

51:23.214 --> 51:24.547
       I lied about that.

51:24.549 --> 51:25.714
  I lied about having friends.

51:25.716 --> 51:27.149
   I don't even have friends.

51:27.151 --> 51:28.317
          I'm a loser.

51:28.319 --> 51:30.152
  The five cats are my world.

51:30.154 --> 51:32.321
    Please, please, listen.

51:32.323 --> 51:35.191
  I thought that if maybe we--
     we were cool with each

51:35.193 --> 51:38.094
  other you guys would like me
       and be my friends,

51:38.096 --> 51:40.096
   and maybe that would turn
      into something where

51:40.098 --> 51:42.765
      you guys would maybe
       have sex with me.

51:42.767 --> 51:44.533
             What?

51:44.535 --> 51:46.769
     Because you're--you're
     prostitutes, you know,

51:46.771 --> 51:48.337
      women of the night!

51:48.339 --> 51:49.638
     We're not prostitutes,
           you moron.

51:49.640 --> 51:52.108
     We're undercover FBI.

51:52.110 --> 51:54.543
           Like--like
    Female Body Inspectors?

51:54.545 --> 51:55.845
     My dad has that shirt.

51:55.847 --> 51:57.546
    We got in the wrong car.

51:57.548 --> 51:58.814
We have to go back to the motel
        and look through

51:58.816 --> 52:00.716
       security footage.

52:00.718 --> 52:02.451
    We got in the wrong car.

52:02.453 --> 52:03.619
   Who got in the right one?

52:08.159 --> 52:10.159
           Yes. Wow.

52:10.161 --> 52:12.128
       I think I just got
    the hang of it on yours.

52:12.130 --> 52:14.363
    It's so good. Thank you!

52:14.365 --> 52:16.298
        You know, you're
     actually really cool.

52:16.300 --> 52:18.868
     Aw. I'm so sorry about
     all that stuff I said

52:18.870 --> 52:20.236
     when I first got here.

52:20.238 --> 52:21.570
     I don't get out much.

52:21.572 --> 52:23.205
   No. It's OK. You're young.

52:23.207 --> 52:24.573
        I get it because
        I'm young, too.

52:24.575 --> 52:26.375
It's like we're peers, you know?

52:26.377 --> 52:28.377
  No. I--I think I'm younger.

52:28.379 --> 52:30.246
          Eh, agree to
     disagree on that, OK?

52:30.248 --> 52:32.748
    OK. So I got to ask you,

52:32.750 --> 52:34.683
 what is up with these outfits?
        You look insane.

52:34.685 --> 52:36.552
   You look like you had your
  period and then splashed it

52:36.554 --> 52:37.853
       back on yourself.

52:37.855 --> 52:39.421
   No. I stopped doing that.

52:39.423 --> 52:40.623
      We're actually just
        on a field trip

52:40.625 --> 52:42.191
 for our AP art history class.

52:42.193 --> 52:43.225
   Everyone got really sick,

52:43.227 --> 52:44.393
    but we decided to go out

52:44.395 --> 52:45.661
  and actually have some fun.

52:45.663 --> 52:48.497
    Oh, OK. Field trip, huh?

52:48.499 --> 52:49.698
    Where are you guys from?

52:49.700 --> 52:50.933
      Ugh. Lake Arrowhead.

52:50.935 --> 52:52.601
     Really? Wait. No way.

52:52.603 --> 52:53.769
 What high school do you go to?

52:53.771 --> 52:55.671
            - Dixon.
           - Get out!

52:55.673 --> 52:57.273
         Get right out.

52:57.275 --> 52:59.642
            Get out!
     Wait! I went to Dixon!

52:59.644 --> 53:01.310
           - Really?
           - Really?

53:01.312 --> 53:04.446
           Ha! Yeah!
  Dixon High Cougars for life,

53:04.448 --> 53:05.748
          you bitches!

53:05.750 --> 53:08.350
          Oh, my God!
        That is so rad.

53:08.352 --> 53:10.386
  Why didn't you guys tell me
       you went to Dixon?

53:10.388 --> 53:13.289
         Seriously, why
      didn't you tell me?

53:13.291 --> 53:15.591
    Err! Why didn't you guys
    tell me you're Cougars?

53:15.593 --> 53:17.293
       I would have used
         a new needle.

53:17.295 --> 53:19.228
          Oh, my God!
This is, like, blowing my mind!

53:19.230 --> 53:20.863
           You guys.

53:20.865 --> 53:22.831
   Oh, my God! Is that creepy
    gym teacher still there,

53:22.833 --> 53:24.500
          the one with
the thick glasses and no teeth?

53:24.502 --> 53:26.635
         - Mr. Abrams.
         - Mr. Abrams.

53:26.637 --> 53:29.205
     Well, he made me call
      him Badger, which...

53:31.209 --> 53:32.441
       He's in jail now.

53:32.443 --> 53:33.776
    Oh, that's--that's good.

53:33.778 --> 53:35.477
  That's actually really good.

53:35.479 --> 53:37.413
      So what are you guys
      doing after school?

53:37.415 --> 53:39.348
I'm probably gonna go to college
   for poli sci in the fall.

53:39.350 --> 53:40.849
    - Because you're smart.
            - Yeah.

53:40.851 --> 53:42.751
    Yeah. I'm probably gonna
      take a few years off

53:42.753 --> 53:44.987
       and travel abroad,
      really find myself.

53:44.989 --> 53:46.689
    OK. I think we all know
     that means you're just

53:46.691 --> 53:48.691
        gonna get wasted
     and hook up with guys

53:48.693 --> 53:50.859
   - who don't speak English.
  - [Abby] That's what I said.

53:50.861 --> 53:52.461
            - Right?
            - Yeah.

53:52.463 --> 53:53.829
            We have
 something. Two little besties.

53:53.831 --> 53:55.564
      Yeah. She's a slut.

53:55.566 --> 53:57.299
    Ha ha ha! You know what?

53:57.301 --> 53:59.602
         You guys wait
    right here, old Cougars.

53:59.604 --> 54:01.270
        I got something
        to show you, OK?

54:01.272 --> 54:02.805
              OK.

54:02.807 --> 54:04.306
      Get the old gal up.

54:04.308 --> 54:05.474
             - Ooh.
           - Got it.

54:05.476 --> 54:07.443
        Ha ha ha! Whoo!

54:07.445 --> 54:09.912
Lightheaded. The doctor told me
        to stop working,

54:09.914 --> 54:12.481
      but I was like, "No!
  You stop working." Ha ha ha!

54:12.483 --> 54:13.716
           BRB, guys.

54:17.855 --> 54:21.357
    Heh. You two are a trip.

54:21.359 --> 54:24.360
     How did you know about
   that Lake Arrowhead stuff?

54:24.362 --> 54:25.961
       What do you mean?

54:25.963 --> 54:27.663
  I mean, did you make it up,
       did you Goggle it?

54:27.665 --> 54:29.765
     Like, how did you know
       she went to Dixon?

54:29.767 --> 54:31.834
      We didn't make it up
    because it's the truth.

54:31.836 --> 54:34.603
  Yeah, right. You're a couple
      of high school girls

54:34.605 --> 54:37.373
          down here on
   a art history field trip?

54:37.375 --> 54:38.807
        AP art history.

54:38.809 --> 54:42.544
           Ha ha ha!
      You messing with me.

54:42.546 --> 54:44.580
     She's good. Ha ha ha!

54:44.582 --> 54:45.981
            - What?
            - What?

54:48.719 --> 54:50.052
  So what are your real names?

54:50.054 --> 54:51.453
           I'm Kate.

54:51.455 --> 54:53.389
  I'm Abby. What's your name?

54:53.391 --> 54:54.623
             Andy.

54:54.625 --> 54:56.325
        Nice to formally
        meet you, Andy.

54:56.327 --> 54:57.960
       Nice to meet you.
     Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

54:57.962 --> 55:00.396
      So how did you know
   about Viceroy and Monarch?

55:00.398 --> 55:02.398
      Yeah. We just saw it
     on an envelope when we

55:02.400 --> 55:03.766
    checked into the motel.

55:03.768 --> 55:05.534
    I mean, it was my idea.

55:05.536 --> 55:07.436
     I was the one who put
    it into my phone, so...

55:09.940 --> 55:11.974
         We got to go.

55:11.976 --> 55:13.776
       We got to go now.
   Put your foot in the shoe.

55:13.778 --> 55:14.977
Come on. We got to go. Let's go.

55:14.979 --> 55:16.445
           Let's go!

55:18.015 --> 55:19.715
       Man, I got to pee.

55:19.717 --> 55:21.517
      OK. Can you hold it?

55:21.519 --> 55:23.385
      Hold it? Man, I been
        holding it, man.

55:23.387 --> 55:24.987
      You're just hearing
         about it now.

55:24.989 --> 55:26.689
     A grown man telling me
        to hold my pee.

55:26.691 --> 55:28.057
           OK. Sorry.

55:28.059 --> 55:30.025
        Why don't you go
      outside, grown man?

55:30.027 --> 55:32.695
      Go outside? Come on.
        I can't do that.

55:32.697 --> 55:35.364
        So uncivilized.

55:35.366 --> 55:37.566
       I met you in jail,
    but that's uncivilized.

55:37.568 --> 55:40.803
 It's Ari, it's Ari, it's Ari.

55:40.805 --> 55:42.071
              OK.

55:42.073 --> 55:44.907
          - Ari, hey.
          - It's done?

55:44.909 --> 55:46.675
         Is what done?

55:46.677 --> 55:48.477
        <i> How many things</i>
   <i> are you doing right now?</i>

55:48.479 --> 55:49.845
       Oh, right, right.

55:49.847 --> 55:51.580
         Right--ha ha.
       He's doing a bit.

55:51.582 --> 55:52.948
       They haven't done
       anything yet, Ari.

55:52.950 --> 55:54.483
      We're still watching
        and surveilling.

55:54.485 --> 55:56.352
       What do you mean?

55:56.354 --> 55:57.986
       <i> Uh, they got some</i>
    <i> clothes, they went into</i>

55:57.988 --> 56:00.489
    an artisinal restaurant,
       and so now they're

56:00.491 --> 56:01.857
        getting tattoos.

56:01.859 --> 56:03.359
            Tattoos?

56:03.361 --> 56:04.626
   I know they hit the place.

56:04.628 --> 56:05.861
     I got text from them.

56:05.863 --> 56:07.663
   What the hell is going on?

56:07.665 --> 56:08.964
      Are they paying you
         to play dumb,

56:08.966 --> 56:10.766
 or are you doing it for free?

56:10.768 --> 56:13.068
      Mr. "Airy," we been
   sitting on them all night.

56:13.070 --> 56:14.536
       We'd have seen it.

56:14.538 --> 56:16.739
         It's "Ar-ee,"
        and no "mister."

56:16.741 --> 56:19.475
         Jesus Christ.
     Something's happening.

56:19.477 --> 56:20.943
  I bet Wheels is in on this.

56:20.945 --> 56:22.478
           I knew it!

56:22.480 --> 56:24.680
   Bring them all to me now!

56:24.682 --> 56:26.115
             - Who?
             - Err!

56:26.117 --> 56:27.583
    [Ari] Who do you think?

56:27.585 --> 56:29.385
     Wheels and the broads!

56:29.387 --> 56:30.853
         Are you high?

56:30.855 --> 56:32.588
           He's good.
  We're gonna take care of it.

56:32.590 --> 56:34.656
   We'll talk to you so soon,
        and I thank you.

56:34.658 --> 56:35.958
            Idiots!

56:42.066 --> 56:43.632
            Come on.
    Let's go. We got to go.

56:46.804 --> 56:49.805
     Guys? My little kids?

56:49.807 --> 56:53.041
             Hello?

56:53.043 --> 56:55.978
  Did I just imagine all that?

56:55.980 --> 56:57.413
         Did--did we do
        something wrong?

56:57.415 --> 56:58.947
       Are you mad at us?

56:58.949 --> 57:00.749
     [Wheels] Not you. Just
    time to call it a night.

57:02.820 --> 57:04.920
 Wheels, how's it going, buddy?

57:04.922 --> 57:06.555
 What are you guys doing here?

57:06.557 --> 57:08.924
     Oh, I think you know.

57:08.926 --> 57:10.626
   There's been a big mix-up.

57:10.628 --> 57:11.860
    I really think you guys
      should let this go.

57:11.862 --> 57:14.630
    Sorry. Not gonna happen.

57:14.632 --> 57:15.998
       Mr. Ari's orders.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.699
       I'm not gonna let
         you take them.

57:17.701 --> 57:20.569
        Oh, don't worry.
     You get to come, too.

57:20.571 --> 57:23.639
      - What's happening?
        - I don't know.

57:23.641 --> 57:25.174
        Get out of here!

57:25.176 --> 57:26.542
         [both scream]

57:28.078 --> 57:29.445
              Ohh!

57:35.686 --> 57:38.921
        Go get the car!

57:38.923 --> 57:40.489
       Hold on, hold on!

57:40.491 --> 57:41.924
        This dress is a
      nightmare to run in.

57:41.926 --> 57:44.693
            I can't.
     My legs won't let me.

57:44.695 --> 57:46.829
         You're wearing
        workout clothes!

57:46.831 --> 57:48.764
              Aah!

57:48.766 --> 57:50.732
      Come on. Are you OK?

57:50.734 --> 57:53.502
   Stay right there, sweetie.

57:53.504 --> 57:55.003
     What are we gonna do?
     What are we gonna do?

57:55.005 --> 57:56.505
        Where do we go?

57:56.507 --> 57:57.806
           This way!

58:00.044 --> 58:02.077
     [dance music playing]

58:04.548 --> 58:06.181
          - What the?
             - Go!

58:15.493 --> 58:16.692
         Did he see us?

58:16.694 --> 58:18.193
       I don't think so.

58:18.195 --> 58:20.095
  - What the hell is going on?
        - I don't know.

58:20.097 --> 58:21.930
    I just want to get back
   to the motel before anyone

58:21.932 --> 58:24.600
     finds out we're gone.
   We should have never left.

58:24.602 --> 58:25.968
    I can't believe you got
       me into all this!

58:25.970 --> 58:27.569
    I got you into all this?
        Are you serious?

58:27.571 --> 58:29.037
     I didn't plan for this
        to happen, Abby.

58:29.039 --> 58:30.672
       I know you didn't
    plan for this to happen

58:30.674 --> 58:32.140
because you don't plan anything.

58:32.142 --> 58:33.809
      You just do whatever
       the hell you want,

58:33.811 --> 58:34.977
      and let other people
       clean up the mess.

58:34.979 --> 58:36.678
    That's--that's not fair!

58:36.680 --> 58:38.514
    I'm not gonna apologize
    for wanting to have fun.

58:38.516 --> 58:39.882
     If it weren't for me,
   you'd never even have any!

58:39.884 --> 58:41.283
        How is this fun?

58:41.285 --> 58:43.218
        I have a tattoo,
    we almost got kidnapped,

58:43.220 --> 58:45.020
    and we're in the middle
           of a rave.

58:45.022 --> 58:46.255
      This is a bad night!

58:54.565 --> 58:55.764
             Yeah.

59:01.238 --> 59:03.038
     Dude, will you please
       put the gun down?

59:03.040 --> 59:04.907
 Did you not see <i> Pulp Fiction?</i>

59:04.909 --> 59:06.308
          Put it down!

59:09.613 --> 59:11.647
   I got to ask were you guys
        orphans trained

59:11.649 --> 59:14.182
     by the Yakuza ninjas?

59:14.184 --> 59:15.984
             What?

59:15.986 --> 59:18.554
         We're not who
       you think we are.

59:18.556 --> 59:19.788
   It's them, man, it's them!

59:19.790 --> 59:21.256
       Put the gun down!

59:38.208 --> 59:39.908
      [Ari] <i> Where is it?</i>

59:39.910 --> 59:42.044
         Where's what?

59:42.046 --> 59:43.612
       What do you think?

59:43.614 --> 59:45.247
    The painting I paid you
          lot of money

59:45.249 --> 59:47.015
        to steal for me.

59:47.017 --> 59:49.818
      I would hate to kill
     the legendary Viceroy

59:49.820 --> 59:53.255
          and Monarch,
   so please do not make me.

59:53.257 --> 59:54.756
    Those aren't our names.

59:54.758 --> 59:56.191
 We didn't steal any paintings.

59:56.193 --> 59:57.693
         We're just two
      high school students

59:57.695 --> 59:59.161
on an AP art history field trip.

59:59.163 --> 01:00:00.996
     Oh, what is this now?

01:00:00.998 --> 01:00:03.799
    You're only high school
  student on art history trip

01:00:03.801 --> 01:00:06.868
      dressed like Madonna
        and Jane Fonda?

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:08.370
             - Who?
           - Shut up.

01:00:08.372 --> 01:00:11.773
    I swear. AP art history.

01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:13.342
            OK. Heh.

01:00:13.344 --> 01:00:16.712
This is how you want to play me.

01:00:16.714 --> 01:00:20.048
      You now have exactly
    three seconds to tell me

01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:22.284
     what I needs to know.

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:24.219
            - One...
   - We don't know anything!

01:00:27.625 --> 01:00:28.857
            - Two...
         - Sir, please.

01:00:28.859 --> 01:00:30.192
      Kate, do something.

01:00:33.664 --> 01:00:35.297
             Three!

01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:37.899
   Fine. You win. You got us.

01:00:37.901 --> 01:00:39.134
             What?

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:40.335
          Yeah, what?

01:00:40.337 --> 01:00:42.070
Yeah. We're Viceroy and Monarch,

01:00:42.072 --> 01:00:43.372
        and we have what
      you're looking for.

01:00:43.374 --> 01:00:44.740
 You can put the gun down now.

01:00:44.742 --> 01:00:46.908
  Ha ha! I knew it! I knew it!

01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:49.811
       I knew it! Brains.

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:52.314
 Just let us go, and we'll come
    back with want you want.

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:54.916
        OK, but no, no.

01:00:54.918 --> 01:00:56.785
           Question.

01:00:56.787 --> 01:01:01.223
 And please be totally honest.

01:01:01.225 --> 01:01:04.226
       Do I look stupid?

01:01:04.228 --> 01:01:06.361
              Hmm?

01:01:06.363 --> 01:01:09.931
 You really think I let you go,
     both of you walk away?

01:01:09.933 --> 01:01:11.199
              No.

01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:22.077
You go, your friend stays here,

01:01:22.079 --> 01:01:23.378
   and if you don't come back

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.747
   before my buyer gets here,

01:01:25.749 --> 01:01:27.449
    I will have to kill her.

01:01:27.451 --> 01:01:28.950
              OK.

01:01:28.952 --> 01:01:30.852
  OK? You can't leave me here.

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:32.154
    I'll be back, I promise.

01:01:32.156 --> 01:01:33.321
          Don't leave.

01:01:33.323 --> 01:01:34.823
              Go.

01:01:34.825 --> 01:01:36.091
 Kate, you can't leave me here.

01:01:36.093 --> 01:01:37.359
           Trust me.

01:01:37.361 --> 01:01:38.927
 Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

01:01:38.929 --> 01:01:41.129
        Kate, Kate, you
      can't leave me here!

01:01:41.131 --> 01:01:42.397
             Kate!

01:01:42.399 --> 01:01:44.132
     Kate, don't leave me!

01:01:44.134 --> 01:01:46.068
        Kate, you can't
         leave me here!

01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:48.704

          Kate, Kate.

01:01:50.174 --> 01:01:52.240
  Hush, please. It's annoying.

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:09.825
     [Ari] OK. Tie her up.

01:02:09.827 --> 01:02:12.194
     I must make pee-pees.

01:02:41.325 --> 01:02:45.127
      What a weird night.

01:02:48.799 --> 01:02:51.133

  [clerk] Don't you guys need,
        like, a warrant

01:02:54.805 --> 01:02:56.471
     for this or something?

01:02:56.473 --> 01:02:58.974
   Not if we never saw this.

01:03:01.011 --> 01:03:04.279
     [Viceroy] Right there.
        There they are.

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:05.847
 [Monarch] How did that happen?

01:03:05.849 --> 01:03:07.249
        You had to pee.
    That's how it happened.

01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:09.084
     Damn it. They could be
        anywhere by now.

01:03:09.086 --> 01:03:13.021
    Help! Help! I need help.
  My friend, she's in danger.

01:03:13.023 --> 01:03:14.956
   I need someone to call the
 police or something right now.

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:16.892
           [panting]

01:03:16.894 --> 01:03:19.427
   It's the girl from the TV.

01:03:19.429 --> 01:03:21.830
             What?

01:03:21.832 --> 01:03:25.233
       [Ari] OK. 50 more.

01:03:25.235 --> 01:03:26.802
             Call.

01:03:26.804 --> 01:03:28.470
        I'll do 50, too.

01:03:28.472 --> 01:03:32.174
         Getting close.
 I hope your partner shows up.

01:03:32.176 --> 01:03:34.543
I'd hate to disappoint my buyer.

01:03:34.545 --> 01:03:37.145
      OK. What do you got?

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:39.581
   Check this out. Pair aces.

01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:43.385
    Ah. Two pair. Got lucky.

01:03:43.387 --> 01:03:45.053
       Shit, damn, crap.

01:03:45.055 --> 01:03:47.956
     You know what happens
        when I see crap?

01:03:47.958 --> 01:03:49.291
  I straight flush it. Ha ha!

01:03:49.293 --> 01:03:51.993
 Damn it. Straight flush where?

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:53.895
  - Look at that. Right there.
           - Damn it.

01:03:53.897 --> 01:03:56.932
      You should've raised
     before the last card.

01:03:58.836 --> 01:04:02.971
 That's when he made his flush
  and he hit his second pair.

01:04:02.973 --> 01:04:05.106
     They both had nothing
          before that.

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:08.977
             What?

01:04:08.979 --> 01:04:12.113
  This one, he made his flush
       on the river card.

01:04:12.115 --> 01:04:14.950
          Am I right?

01:04:14.952 --> 01:04:16.852
             Maybe.

01:04:16.854 --> 01:04:19.254
          Definitely.

01:04:19.256 --> 01:04:22.123
 Impressive. You want to play?

01:04:22.125 --> 01:04:24.893
    Come on. Hey...shut up.

01:04:24.895 --> 01:04:28.496
   This will be interesting.
  You can play for your life.

01:04:33.136 --> 01:04:34.603
   [Kate] I don't know, guys.

01:04:34.605 --> 01:04:36.605
   This honestly sounds like
        a terrible idea.

01:04:36.607 --> 01:04:39.374
 If anything goes wrong or you
  feel in danger at any point,

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:42.143
   just say, "Safari," and we
   will come in and get you.

01:04:42.145 --> 01:04:44.946
            Safari.

01:04:44.948 --> 01:04:47.182
     I don't know anymore.
     Can I change my mind?

01:04:47.184 --> 01:04:50.552
I'm sorry. You girls interfered
 with a federal investigation,

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:53.121
   so if you and your friend
   want to stay out of jail,

01:04:53.123 --> 01:04:54.923
  this is what you have to do.

01:04:54.925 --> 01:04:56.892
            Safari.

01:04:56.894 --> 01:04:59.294
 [Viceroy] That's the code word
   for us to come in--safari.

01:04:59.296 --> 01:05:00.562
          Personally,
 I think you're gonna be fine.

01:05:00.564 --> 01:05:03.131
           - Shut up.
          - You ready?

01:05:03.133 --> 01:05:06.935
        Safari. Safari.

01:05:06.937 --> 01:05:09.204
       - That's the word.
           - Safari.

01:05:09.206 --> 01:05:12.207
      That's what's gon--
        Yep. That's it.

01:05:12.209 --> 01:05:15.443
  No. I'm saying it right now.
            Safari.

01:05:15.445 --> 01:05:17.946
     [Abby] <i> Should I deal?</i>

01:05:17.948 --> 01:05:20.282
I'll deal. Your hands are tied.

01:05:20.284 --> 01:05:22.517
           [laughter]

01:05:22.519 --> 01:05:24.419
             Right.

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:27.455
  [Ari] So, uh, where did you
      learn to play cards?

01:05:27.457 --> 01:05:29.124
    I play with my brothers,

01:05:29.126 --> 01:05:30.659
   even started a poker club
        in high school.

01:05:30.661 --> 01:05:33.094
  Enough with the high school
        stuff, already.

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:35.697
        - I'm not idiot.
       - It's the truth.

01:05:35.699 --> 01:05:39.000
    So I suppose you want me
     to believe you're not

01:05:39.002 --> 01:05:42.704
this, uh, Viceroy and Monarch or
whatever the hell names you are.

01:05:42.706 --> 01:05:44.339
       No. My friend just
        used those names

01:05:44.341 --> 01:05:46.141
      because she thought
         it'd be funny.

01:05:46.143 --> 01:05:48.209
       I don't even know
  what she's up to right now,

01:05:48.211 --> 01:05:50.645
     but I can assure you,
she's not getting any painting.

01:05:54.651 --> 01:05:56.651
      [Ari] Ach, garbage.

01:05:58.021 --> 01:06:00.422
             Ah...

01:06:00.424 --> 01:06:03.091
    - I can prove it to you.
             - How?

01:06:03.093 --> 01:06:05.293
  Could I borrow your laptop?
   I'll show you my profile.

01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:08.596
       It has everything
     that I told you on it.

01:06:09.666 --> 01:06:12.367
          OK. Go get.

01:06:18.976 --> 01:06:20.976
        [clears throat]

01:06:31.088 --> 01:06:32.454
              See?

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:36.758
          Oh, my God.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:39.761
        Lake Arrowhead?
     I love Lake Arrowhead.

01:06:39.763 --> 01:06:42.530
          - So pretty.
            - Yeah.

01:06:42.532 --> 01:06:45.133
  - I almost moved there once.
       - Why didn't you?

01:06:45.135 --> 01:06:47.602
  Went to prison instead. OK.

01:06:47.604 --> 01:06:52.507
     OK. Says it's private.
      You have to add me.

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:55.477
     Sorry, but I only add
         people I know.

01:06:55.479 --> 01:06:58.246
         Ha! I respect
     your privacy settings,

01:06:58.248 --> 01:07:01.383
    but, uh, given the fact
  that this is life or death,

01:07:01.385 --> 01:07:03.718
 I suspect you make exception.

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.320
          Good point.

01:07:05.322 --> 01:07:08.356
      Let me just sign in
         really quick.

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:10.191
         Smarty pants.

01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:12.227
       Totally understand
    the whole privacy thing.

01:07:12.229 --> 01:07:13.728
     You don't want a bunch
       of random weirdoes

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:15.263
  routing through your photos.

01:07:15.265 --> 01:07:18.233
           [chuckles]

01:07:18.235 --> 01:07:19.701
      You have a Facebook?

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:22.170
 Uh, I'm still over on MySpace.

01:07:22.172 --> 01:07:24.205
              My--
        You have a band?

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:28.343
            - Yeah.
      - Your band is lame.

01:07:28.345 --> 01:07:30.378
          [Abby] See?

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:33.348
       That's from today.

01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:37.819
     Holy crap. Holy crap.

01:07:37.821 --> 01:07:40.655
   2,000 friends? Impressive.

01:07:40.657 --> 01:07:42.457
      Yeah, pretty popular
      around the Internet.

01:07:42.459 --> 01:07:46.528
 Heh. Poker club. Is real. Ha!

01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:50.298
 So wait. You are named...Abby?

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.067
             - Yep.
             - Hmm.

01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:54.702
    - You look like an Abby.
           - I know.

01:07:54.704 --> 01:07:57.472
    - Spanish club, pom-pom?
             - Ha!

01:07:57.474 --> 01:08:00.341
     You're pom-pom? Prom?

01:08:00.343 --> 01:08:02.077
           [laughter]

01:08:02.079 --> 01:08:05.747
         Look at this.
  Oh, my God, AP Art History.

01:08:05.749 --> 01:08:10.085
   Christ, this is hilarious.
           Ha ha ha!

01:08:10.087 --> 01:08:12.720
      She is not gangster.
         She is child.

01:08:12.722 --> 01:08:15.757
  That's what I've been trying
  to tell you this whole time.

01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:19.527
    We almost killed minor.
           Ha ha ha!

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:22.162
             [man]
   You almost died. Ha ha ha!

01:08:22.165 --> 01:08:24.165
       Look at your face.

01:08:24.167 --> 01:08:26.501
  I had the plastic laid down
   in my van and everything.

01:08:26.502 --> 01:08:30.270
    There's egg on my face.
           Ha ha ha!

01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:33.841
     Where is my painting?
      We need my painting!

01:08:36.379 --> 01:08:38.246
           Good luck.

01:08:45.822 --> 01:08:48.555
           [exhales]

01:08:48.558 --> 01:08:50.692
          I don't know
  if she's got what it takes.

01:08:50.694 --> 01:08:52.560
           - Shut up.
           - Shut up.

01:08:52.562 --> 01:08:55.596
     [Ari] Apologies, kid.
Hell of a mix-up. Cut her loose.

01:08:55.599 --> 01:08:57.332
          No worries.

01:08:57.334 --> 01:08:58.867
     Look. I'll have my men
    take you back to motel.

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:01.169
 Go home. Don't come back, OK?

01:09:01.171 --> 01:09:02.537
            - Deal.
            - Right.

01:09:02.538 --> 01:09:04.272
    Hey, hello. This is Ari.

01:09:04.274 --> 01:09:06.307
  For-real Monarch or Viceroy,
          please call.

01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:10.645
    Emergency. Call me now.
     Damn it. Gosh darn it.

01:09:13.783 --> 01:09:16.551
             - Hey.
        - What the hell?

01:09:16.553 --> 01:09:18.886
            - Kate?
    - I got what you wanted.

01:09:18.889 --> 01:09:20.688
            - What?
             - Yep.

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:23.390
            - What?
         - Here it is.

01:09:23.393 --> 01:09:25.393
      Now let my friend go
       like you promised.

01:09:25.395 --> 01:09:28.162
      - We're square here.
  - Kate, what are you doing?

01:09:28.165 --> 01:09:29.930
     I told him the truth.
   He was about to let me go.

01:09:29.933 --> 01:09:32.700
  Don't call me Kate, Viceroy.
     I'm saving your life.

01:09:32.702 --> 01:09:35.270
   Whoa, whoa, whoa. Viceroy?

01:09:35.272 --> 01:09:36.938
       I--I have no idea
   what she's talking about.

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:39.174
   I'm not Viceroy. I'm Abby.

01:09:39.176 --> 01:09:42.343
    I'm so Abby. Look at me.
   You even said so yourself.

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:45.880
   Ha ha ha! I can't believe
          I bought it.

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:50.518
Oh, my God, you two are so good.
      Wowee, wowee, wowee.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.654
       [Kate] We get it.

01:09:52.656 --> 01:09:54.889
  I gave you what you wanted.
         Now can we go?

01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:58.459
 Ha! I suppose a deal's a deal.

01:09:58.461 --> 01:10:01.296
    - Who are you right now?
  - Drop the act. We're beat.

01:10:01.298 --> 01:10:04.332
    He's onto us. Can we go?

01:10:04.334 --> 01:10:07.602
  You can leave when my buyer
  authenticates this painting.

01:10:07.604 --> 01:10:09.237
            Please.

01:10:10.907 --> 01:10:13.474
    Little late, gentlemen.

01:10:13.476 --> 01:10:17.845
       Now let's see what
    all this noise is about.

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:26.888
   [Abby] Is that a painting?
 Kate, where did you get that?

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:29.490
    You know where I got it,
            Viceroy.

01:10:29.492 --> 01:10:32.760
     OK. Have seat. Relax.
         We have time.

01:10:32.762 --> 01:10:35.563
     You need soda, chips,
      Chex Mix, pretzels?

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:37.365
       I have everything.

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:42.270
      Wowee, wowee, wowee.

01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:45.907
           She's in.

01:10:47.444 --> 01:10:48.843
      - Can I have a gun?
             - No.

01:10:48.845 --> 01:10:50.445
         It feels like
      I should have a gun.

01:10:50.447 --> 01:10:52.981
Oh, we might just pull this off.

01:10:52.983 --> 01:10:54.349
          Who's that?

01:10:55.385 --> 01:10:57.652
        [tires screech]

01:11:00.624 --> 01:11:03.725
   [Ari] Anyone can play CD.
       "Look. I'm band."

01:11:03.727 --> 01:11:05.560
      You're basically DJ.

01:11:05.562 --> 01:11:08.263
     - Why'd you come back?
   - I came back to save you.

01:11:08.265 --> 01:11:10.999
           Great job.

01:11:11.001 --> 01:11:13.001
         [Wheels] Ari?

01:11:13.003 --> 01:11:18.039
  [Ari] Wheels, what the hell
      are you doing here?

01:11:18.041 --> 01:11:20.375
     I thought you would've
           gone AWOL.

01:11:20.377 --> 01:11:22.310
      I trusted you, guy.

01:11:22.312 --> 01:11:25.613
          Ari, listen.
   You've got to let them go.

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:27.982
          They're not
    who you think they are.

01:11:27.984 --> 01:11:30.418
  They're in high school, man.
   I have their real clothes.

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:32.720
    - Ugh, smells horrible.
           - I know.

01:11:32.722 --> 01:11:34.389
    There's something wrong
           with them,

01:11:34.391 --> 01:11:35.923
   but they're not your pros.

01:11:35.925 --> 01:11:39.460
    You got to listen to me.
       I made a mistake.

01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:41.696
          Mistake. Mm.

01:11:41.698 --> 01:11:45.633
        Perhaps you can
      explain this, then.

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:49.070
              I--

01:11:49.072 --> 01:11:53.608
 Wheels, only mistake you make
      is coming back here.

01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:56.377
      You are liar, liar,
         pants on fire!

01:11:56.379 --> 01:11:59.080
    I don't understand, man.

01:11:59.082 --> 01:12:02.050
      When'd you do this?
I was with you the entire time?

01:12:02.052 --> 01:12:05.586
Don't ask me. I don't know what
 the hell is going on anymore.

01:12:05.588 --> 01:12:07.488
      [Viceroy] That's it.
    He's about to kill them.

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:09.557
   I can't believe I let you
       talk me into this.

01:12:09.559 --> 01:12:11.025
       We have to get her
       out of there now.

01:12:11.027 --> 01:12:13.861
          - Just wait.
       - I'd love a gun.

01:12:13.863 --> 01:12:15.530
     [Wheels] I don't know
   what you told these guys,

01:12:15.532 --> 01:12:17.498
          but they're
     very dangerous people,

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.634
   so whatever you told them,
    you need to untell them.

01:12:26.076 --> 01:12:28.109
        - Oh, ho ho ho!
            - Kate!

01:12:28.111 --> 01:12:31.746
         Wowee, wowee.
This is what I'm talking about.

01:12:31.748 --> 01:12:34.449
            - Kate?
 - Shut up. My name's Monarch.

01:12:34.451 --> 01:12:36.751
            Listen.

01:12:36.753 --> 01:12:39.087
  - Even, like, a little gun.
             - Shh.

01:12:39.089 --> 01:12:41.823
      This is who you sent
  to pick us up, Ari? Come on.

01:12:41.825 --> 01:12:43.791
      Listen. I don't know
  what you think you're doing,

01:12:43.793 --> 01:12:46.994
    - but you need to stop--
        - Oh, ho ho ho!

01:12:46.996 --> 01:12:49.764
You are the worst criminal I've
  ever worked with in my life.

01:12:49.766 --> 01:12:52.934
  Took you about five minutes
   to spill your guts, Andy.

01:12:52.936 --> 01:12:55.570
         What? "Andy"?

01:12:55.572 --> 01:12:57.372
           - "Andy"?
         - Hello, Andy.

01:12:57.374 --> 01:13:00.108
          - Hi, Andy.
    - Hello, Andy. Ha ha ha!

01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:03.478
     Oh, it's Raggedy Andy.
           Ha ha ha!

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:05.680
 I told you that in confidence.

01:13:05.682 --> 01:13:08.449
      I love these girls.
      Poker club? Please.

01:13:08.451 --> 01:13:13.087
          Uh, Wheels--
  excuse me--Andy, take seat.

01:13:13.089 --> 01:13:16.891
Ha ha ha! You got bitch-slapped.
          Now you sit.

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:20.528
    Oh, Andy. Shit, I'd want
   to be called Wheels, too.

01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:22.430
           [laughter]

01:13:22.432 --> 01:13:24.799
           Good girl.

01:13:24.801 --> 01:13:26.868
        She's got balls.
        I give her that.

01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:28.770
      Is this fun for you?

01:13:28.772 --> 01:13:31.973

  [Kate] Why'd you come back?

01:14:13.216 --> 01:14:15.950
   - I came back to save you.
          - Great job.

01:14:15.952 --> 01:14:18.653
         You don't need
     to be slapping people.

01:14:20.156 --> 01:14:21.756
     Let's make this quick.

       The jet's leaving
        within the hour.

01:14:23.226 --> 01:14:26.961
    - I'd like to be on it.
       - Yes, ma'am. Ari?

01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:28.996
         In here. Look.

01:14:28.998 --> 01:14:31.566
    I hope, for your sakes,
     this painting's real.

01:14:31.568 --> 01:14:33.835
      Keep an eye on them.
         Watch my back.

01:14:33.837 --> 01:14:36.771
 Welcome. Thank you for coming.

01:14:36.773 --> 01:14:40.541
          Hello, Ari.
   I'm the one you spoke to.

01:14:40.543 --> 01:14:44.645
  Ha ha! Wowee, wowee, wowee.
        So much better.

01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:45.847
         Who are they?

01:14:45.849 --> 01:14:47.515
Oh, this is Viceroy and Monarch.

01:14:47.517 --> 01:14:48.983
       They are the ones
    who steal the painting.

01:14:48.985 --> 01:14:51.018
   Yeah. I heard about them.

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:52.954
       You guys are gonna
        be huge one day.

01:14:52.956 --> 01:14:54.622
    May I get you something
           to drink?

01:14:54.624 --> 01:14:56.123
      I have soda, chips,
        so much in back.

01:14:56.125 --> 01:14:58.092
    No. I don't need snacks.

01:14:58.094 --> 01:15:00.061
   I don't even want to know
 what you have in the back, OK?

01:15:00.063 --> 01:15:02.930
The only thing I'm interested in
  is a lost Van Gogh painting.

01:15:02.932 --> 01:15:05.199
    Right, right. It's, uh--

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:13.007
              Oh.

01:15:13.009 --> 01:15:15.610

          - It's real?

01:15:25.555 --> 01:15:27.121
  Now let's see if it's real.

01:15:27.123 --> 01:15:28.556

        [clears throat]

01:15:41.304 --> 01:15:42.737
   [Ari] Of course it's real.

01:15:42.739 --> 01:15:44.238
           - Uh-huh.
          - Of course.

01:15:50.613 --> 01:15:54.949
   Crazy. There's no painting
          on the back.

01:15:54.951 --> 01:15:56.884
            Mm-hmm.

       come on, come on.

01:16:02.158 --> 01:16:03.758
      [Monarch] Why is she
        taking so long?

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:04.926
      - I don't like this.
           - Shut up.

01:16:04.928 --> 01:16:06.561
          Mm-hmm. OK.

01:16:06.563 --> 01:16:08.329
     Crazy person painted.
         You can tell.

01:16:12.969 --> 01:16:15.136
           Good job.

01:16:15.138 --> 01:16:18.673
  I never thought that I would
  see this painting in person.

01:16:18.675 --> 01:16:20.308
            [sighs]

01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:22.310
   Do you know that Van Gogh
          once said--

01:16:22.312 --> 01:16:25.947
  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.
     Do you have my money?

01:16:25.949 --> 01:16:27.348
           Of course.

01:16:34.324 --> 01:16:36.190
          Gotcha! Yes.

01:16:36.192 --> 01:16:37.725
      I can't believe it.
      It actually worked.

01:16:37.727 --> 01:16:39.226
   Right. I'm going in there.

01:16:39.228 --> 01:16:40.962
      Hold on. We're gonna
    wait for them to leave.

01:16:40.964 --> 01:16:42.830
     But she's right there.

01:16:42.832 --> 01:16:44.765
  We're not gonna go in there
     and start a shootout.

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:46.233
These girls are in high school.

01:16:46.235 --> 01:16:48.102
      Call it in and have
       a team on standby.

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:49.904
     I'm actually with her
          on that one.

01:16:49.906 --> 01:16:51.906
  I think that's a good call.

01:16:51.908 --> 01:16:55.876
    I know. I know. Shut up.

01:16:55.878 --> 01:16:59.046
- You can count it if you like.
         - I trust you.

    You are beautiful woman.

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:07.822
   I, uh, heard this painting
       is worth millions.

01:17:07.824 --> 01:17:10.257
   You'll make a lot of money
       when you sell it.

01:17:10.259 --> 01:17:12.293
 I already have a lot of money,
     and I'm not gonna sell

01:17:12.295 --> 01:17:14.695
 this painting, but I wouldn't
 expect you to understand that.

01:17:14.697 --> 01:17:17.298
     You're right. I don't.

01:17:18.901 --> 01:17:21.969

     is going on in there?

I told you we should've gone in.

01:17:44.093 --> 01:17:45.860

        - You stay here.

         Oh, thank God.
 I don't know why I said that.

01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:49.030

 but the FBI was already there.

01:20:26.222 --> 01:20:29.390
    Do you know what happens
    to bitches who snitches?

01:20:29.392 --> 01:20:31.091
           - Huh huh!
             - Ah!

01:20:38.935 --> 01:20:41.235
  Ari, Van Gogh fuck yourself.

01:20:41.237 --> 01:20:44.205
          - Hey, Ari.
           - Uh! Ooh!

01:20:44.207 --> 01:20:47.107
    That's it. I'm going in.

01:20:47.109 --> 01:20:49.577
 Yargh. I'll wait five minutes.

01:20:49.579 --> 01:20:51.312
    I'll wait five minutes.

01:20:51.314 --> 01:20:53.514
 Five minutes, then I'll go in.
          Ten minutes.

01:20:53.516 --> 01:20:54.949
          Yeah, right.

01:20:54.951 --> 01:20:56.283
           Ooh! Ah...

01:20:56.285 --> 01:20:59.086
             - Uh!
             - Ooh!

01:20:59.088 --> 01:21:01.155
           [gagging]

01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:06.327
              Hah!

01:21:08.931 --> 01:21:12.466
         - Whoa, nice.
    - Yeah. Well, you know--

01:21:12.468 --> 01:21:14.535
    - Where's The Collector?
        - She got away.

01:21:14.537 --> 01:21:17.338
   She can't have gotten far.
            Come on.

01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:21.108
      [Brian] 15 minutes,
         then I go in.

01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:23.410
          Oh, no way.

01:21:23.412 --> 01:21:27.181
    That's it. It's go time.

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:35.055
         [Brian] Aaaah!

01:21:41.464 --> 01:21:43.497
             What?

01:21:43.499 --> 01:21:46.300
             What?

01:21:46.302 --> 01:21:48.669
              Yes!

01:21:48.671 --> 01:21:51.305
          U.S.A. Yes!

01:21:51.307 --> 01:21:53.507
           Oh, ho ho!

01:21:53.509 --> 01:21:55.309
    Well, well, well, hello.

01:21:55.311 --> 01:21:57.278
        Oh, no big deal,
  just took out The Collector.

01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:59.179
 I don't want to talk about it.

01:21:59.181 --> 01:22:01.382
      - All right, Brian.
     - Yeah. That's right.

01:22:01.384 --> 01:22:04.285
 Now, you see, I saw her there,
     and I knew who she was

01:22:04.287 --> 01:22:06.320
   because of what we've been
       saying, and so I--

01:22:06.322 --> 01:22:07.955
     I automatically knew.

01:22:07.957 --> 01:22:09.390
        You know, I used
       the IPDE process--

01:22:09.392 --> 01:22:11.425
       identify, predict,
       decide, execute--

01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:13.527
   really hit her hard, too.

01:22:13.529 --> 01:22:15.262
   She didn't see it coming.

01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:17.398
      The look on her face
     I'll remember forever.

01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:20.301
    She's not dead, is she?

01:22:20.303 --> 01:22:23.504
        Uh! Damn it. Uh!

01:22:23.506 --> 01:22:26.173
              OK.

01:22:26.175 --> 01:22:27.608
           All right.

01:22:29.111 --> 01:22:31.979
         Hundred large.
    Thanks for the gig, Ari.

01:22:31.981 --> 01:22:35.382
      Good luck in Brazil.
      You girls all right?

01:22:35.384 --> 01:22:37.217
          We'll live.

01:22:37.219 --> 01:22:39.053
- Thanks for coming back for us.
      - Sorry about that.

01:22:39.055 --> 01:22:40.688
   I really didn't trust you
     until I got back home

01:22:40.690 --> 01:22:43.223
    and smelled your clothes
  in the back seat of my car.

01:22:43.225 --> 01:22:45.993
   Yeah. We're probably gonna
        need those back.

01:22:45.995 --> 01:22:49.697
        [Viceroy] Kate?
      Where are you? Kate!

01:22:49.699 --> 01:22:51.966
   Guys, chill. It's the FBI.

01:22:51.968 --> 01:22:54.535
     I'm over here. Safari.

01:22:54.537 --> 01:22:56.503
    The FBI? What the hell?

01:22:56.505 --> 01:22:58.505
           - Freeze.
    - Let me see your hands.

01:22:58.507 --> 01:23:01.141
       Hands in the air.

01:23:02.445 --> 01:23:03.610
    [Kate] Guys, it's cool.
           It's cool.

01:23:03.612 --> 01:23:05.412
  This is Abby. This is Andy.

01:23:05.414 --> 01:23:07.348
       He was our driver
   I was telling you about--

01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:09.416
       he literally just
       saved our lives--

01:23:09.418 --> 01:23:11.685
        and that's Ari.

01:23:11.687 --> 01:23:17.291
       Uh-huh. Hey, Ari,
  nice meeting you in person.

01:23:17.293 --> 01:23:18.659
       Who are you guys?

01:23:18.661 --> 01:23:20.494
        They're the real
      Viceroy and Monarch.

01:23:20.496 --> 01:23:22.296
[Wheels] The one I was supposed
    to pick up at the motel?

01:23:22.298 --> 01:23:24.031
             - Yep.
       - And you're cops?

01:23:24.033 --> 01:23:25.566
       Well, not exactly.

01:23:25.568 --> 01:23:27.234
 We work for an undercover unit
        that specializes

01:23:27.236 --> 01:23:29.203
       in recovering lost
      and stolen artwork.

01:23:29.205 --> 01:23:30.671
       It's complicated.

01:23:30.673 --> 01:23:32.373
   [Wheels] After everything
        that's happened,

01:23:32.375 --> 01:23:34.274
        this is probably
the only thing that makes sense.

01:23:34.276 --> 01:23:36.677
           - No way.
     - I tried to tell you.

01:23:36.679 --> 01:23:38.712
     We should leave before
    the local cops get here.

01:23:38.714 --> 01:23:40.647
    I don't want to fill out
      all that paperwork.

01:23:40.649 --> 01:23:42.516
 [Viceroy] Yeah. You're right.
     That sounds horrible.

01:23:42.518 --> 01:23:44.018
       Am I under arrest?

01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:45.786
             - No.
            - No...

01:23:45.788 --> 01:23:48.455
      but the three of you
      are coming with us.

01:23:48.457 --> 01:23:51.358
     There's one more thing
    we got to take care of.

01:23:59.402 --> 01:24:01.668
         Get a move on.

01:24:04.206 --> 01:24:06.240
            Coming.

01:24:07.243 --> 01:24:08.475
            [sighs]

01:24:08.477 --> 01:24:10.644
       Crazy night, huh?

01:24:10.646 --> 01:24:13.414
              Yup.

01:24:13.416 --> 01:24:15.382
       Are you mad at me?

01:24:15.384 --> 01:24:18.185
              No.

01:24:18.187 --> 01:24:20.220
      You ready for this?

01:24:20.222 --> 01:24:22.656
       Yeah. Let's do it.
    I just want to go home.

01:24:39.542 --> 01:24:41.475
          That was it?

01:24:41.477 --> 01:24:43.844
  Make it look so much better
         in the movies.

01:24:43.846 --> 01:24:46.613
They make losing your virginity
look better in the movies, too.

01:24:46.615 --> 01:24:47.781
    Movies are full of sh--

01:25:01.831 --> 01:25:04.765
          You guys did
      a great job tonight.

01:25:04.767 --> 01:25:07.434
      So what happens now?
       Are we in trouble?

01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:10.337
     [Viceroy] No. As long
 as you guys don't tell anybody

01:25:10.339 --> 01:25:12.873
  about your involvement here,
   this car is the last link

01:25:12.875 --> 01:25:15.142
           between us
   and what happened tonight.

01:25:15.144 --> 01:25:16.743
  We won't tell if you won't.

01:25:16.745 --> 01:25:18.345
         We made a deal
 when I got back to the motel.

01:25:18.347 --> 01:25:19.713
      They said as long as
         I helped them,

01:25:19.715 --> 01:25:21.582
    they won't tell anyone.

01:25:21.584 --> 01:25:23.183
      You did that for me?

01:25:23.185 --> 01:25:25.119
      Someone had to clean
         this mess up.

01:25:25.121 --> 01:25:27.221
    [Viceroy] All we wanted
 out of this was The Collector.

01:25:27.223 --> 01:25:28.856
      With her in custody,
    we will recover millions

01:25:28.858 --> 01:25:30.891
       in stolen artwork.

01:25:30.893 --> 01:25:32.659
    See you around, ladies.

01:25:32.661 --> 01:25:36.396
     [Brian] What about me?
     What about old Brian?

01:25:36.398 --> 01:25:38.198
          You guys put
   a loaded gun in my mouth,

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:41.168
   made me hit a strange lady
       with my dad's car,

01:25:41.170 --> 01:25:43.537
    which you just blew up.

01:25:43.539 --> 01:25:46.340
        Well, you can't
      win them all, Brian.

01:25:48.577 --> 01:25:50.544
         Sucks for you.

01:25:50.546 --> 01:25:52.479
         Sucks for me?
   I didn't win any of them.

01:25:52.481 --> 01:25:54.915
         I won nothing.
     I didn't win anything.

01:25:57.186 --> 01:25:59.253
      Sun's about to rise.

01:25:59.255 --> 01:26:00.721
      If my dad finds out
    we went out last night,

01:26:00.723 --> 01:26:02.923
       then he finds out,
    doesn't matter anymore.

01:26:02.925 --> 01:26:05.492
 [Wheels] We can still make it.
           Let's go.

01:26:07.196 --> 01:26:11.298
        [tires screech]

01:26:13.602 --> 01:26:16.236
        [tires screech]

01:26:16.238 --> 01:26:17.905
   [Wheels] Sorry about that.
         You all right?

01:26:17.907 --> 01:26:19.873
Uh, yeah. Don't worry about us.
          We're fine.

01:26:19.875 --> 01:26:22.709
  Yeah. We're fine. Go faster.

01:26:22.711 --> 01:26:25.212
 [Abby] I can't believe the FBI
   let you blow up that car.

01:26:25.214 --> 01:26:27.714
         I know, right?
 I've always wanted to do that.

01:26:27.716 --> 01:26:30.250
           - Me, too!
      - It was so badass.

01:26:30.252 --> 01:26:32.419
     Even if we get caught,
      it was so worth it.

01:26:32.421 --> 01:26:34.288
       [Kate] Yes. Whoa!

01:26:34.290 --> 01:26:36.390
    [Wheels] Hey, you're not
       gonna get caught.

01:26:36.392 --> 01:26:37.958
    You're going to college,
and Kate, she's going to Europe

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:39.760
        to do her thing
     with a bunch of dudes.

01:26:39.762 --> 01:26:41.628
      Oh, my God, I am not
      gonna go to Europe.

01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:43.530
  Staying here to do her thing
     with a bunch of dudes.

01:26:43.532 --> 01:26:45.265
   I'm not gonna do anything
      with any dudes, OK?

01:26:45.267 --> 01:26:47.501
      My parents can't pay
          for college.

01:26:47.503 --> 01:26:49.970
     [Abby] Why didn't you
       just tell me that?

01:26:49.972 --> 01:26:53.807
   I found out this morning,
    and I'm embarrassed, OK?

01:26:53.809 --> 01:26:55.542
   I know how excited you are
         about college.

01:26:55.544 --> 01:26:57.377
      I don't want to ruin
       your whole thing.

01:26:57.379 --> 01:26:59.947
  Kate, there's really nothing
    to be embarrassed about.

01:26:59.949 --> 01:27:01.648
       There are so many
       successful people

01:27:01.650 --> 01:27:03.483
     who don't even end up
       going to college,

01:27:03.485 --> 01:27:06.353
      and you could go to
community college or something.

01:27:06.355 --> 01:27:09.289
   Maybe I'd even stay and go
 to community college with you.

01:27:09.291 --> 01:27:11.491
       - What? You would?
          - Hell, no.

01:27:11.493 --> 01:27:12.659
        [tires screech]

01:27:12.661 --> 01:27:14.494
             - Aah!
             - Aah!

01:27:14.496 --> 01:27:15.929
  Ladies, we're getting close.
      Put your clothes on.

01:27:15.931 --> 01:27:19.399
            - Gross!
  - Oh, these smell so gross.

01:27:27.810 --> 01:27:30.344
        [tires screech]

01:27:31.547 --> 01:27:34.948
         - Whoa, Andy!
            - Andy!

01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:36.883
          Ha ha! See?
    I told you we'd make it.

01:27:36.885 --> 01:27:38.685
   - Hey, we still got time.
        - Thanks, Andy.

01:27:38.687 --> 01:27:40.621
        Hey, no worries.

01:27:40.623 --> 01:27:43.557
      Uh, maybe we should
   take a second to thank me,

01:27:43.559 --> 01:27:45.726
   the one who saved the day.

01:27:45.728 --> 01:27:48.629
      What? You smacked me
       in the face twice.

01:27:48.631 --> 01:27:51.398
  Yeah, and I was held hostage
           with guns.

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:53.767
     Don't be so dramatic.

01:27:53.769 --> 01:27:55.469
  [Wheels] Ha! You know what?

01:27:55.471 --> 01:27:57.437
     Actually, I should be
       thanking you guys.

01:27:57.439 --> 01:28:00.674
      If you didn't wander
  into my vehicle by mistake,

01:28:00.676 --> 01:28:04.845
 I'd be dead or in jail by now,
         so thank you,

01:28:04.847 --> 01:28:08.615
 and here's a little something
     for your college fund.

01:28:08.617 --> 01:28:10.651
      Oh, are you serious?

01:28:10.653 --> 01:28:12.753
         Better take it
    before I change my mind.

01:28:12.755 --> 01:28:14.855
    See? Everything's gonna
           work out.

01:28:14.857 --> 01:28:16.757
             [Kate]
 Oh, my God, we should go back,

01:28:16.759 --> 01:28:18.625
    sell an actual painting
      on the black market.

01:28:18.627 --> 01:28:20.394
             [Abby]
     No. We--we need to go.

01:28:20.396 --> 01:28:22.896
   - You never listen to me.
         - Bye, Wheels.

01:28:22.898 --> 01:28:24.531
           Bye, Andy.

01:28:24.533 --> 01:28:25.899
       [cell phone rings]

01:28:25.901 --> 01:28:28.902
         Ha ha ha! Oh.
       Hey, boo-boo. Hey.

01:28:28.904 --> 01:28:31.505
I--I was just coming home. yeah.

01:28:43.352 --> 01:28:44.918
              Hi.

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:47.454
   Thank you for being early,
         Kate and Abby.

01:28:53.929 --> 01:28:57.431
  Oh, wow, smells a lot worse
   than yesterday, you guys,

01:28:57.433 --> 01:29:00.400
          a lot worse.

01:29:05.341 --> 01:29:07.741
        [engine starts]

01:29:09.578 --> 01:29:11.978
Yeah, and there's--there's still
    vomit in a couple spots,

01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:14.948
       so just be careful
         where you sit.

01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:16.783
    [Chad] Bro, I'm so sorry
    I ever made fun of you.

01:29:16.785 --> 01:29:19.720
   I was just self-conscious
     about my own identity,

01:29:19.722 --> 01:29:21.355
    so I took it out on you.

01:29:21.357 --> 01:29:24.391
       No. I was a dick.
       You're a good guy.

01:29:26.028 --> 01:29:28.729
   [Goldstein] Jessie, what's
  going on? What's happening?

01:29:28.731 --> 01:29:31.631
       Hey, how are you?

01:29:31.633 --> 01:29:37.037
        Fine, except for
   I fricking hate everyone.

01:29:37.039 --> 01:29:38.905
     What's happening here?
        What's going on?

01:29:42.578 --> 01:29:45.479
  How was your night, you two?

01:29:45.481 --> 01:29:47.814
          - Uh, uh...
         - Pretty good.

01:29:47.816 --> 01:29:50.517
 I mean, you guys probably were
      having a lot of fun,

01:29:50.519 --> 01:29:51.885
  but we decided to sneak out

01:29:51.887 --> 01:29:53.553
   because it was getting all
            stinky,

01:29:53.555 --> 01:29:55.088
and so we got in the wrong car,

01:29:55.090 --> 01:29:56.857
    tried to sell a painting
      on the black market.

01:29:56.859 --> 01:29:58.792
       The FBI showed up,
   but they were super nice.

01:29:58.794 --> 01:30:00.527
        - It was weird.
        - She got shot.

01:30:00.529 --> 01:30:03.764
     No. Yeah. Yeah, but it
      was mostly marinara.

01:30:03.766 --> 01:30:07.534
        OK. Very funny,
       Paula Poundstone.

01:30:07.536 --> 01:30:12.706
      Bear, stop laughing.
Just stay in your seats, please.

01:30:12.708 --> 01:30:15.542
        Another awesome
      Saturday night, huh?

01:30:15.544 --> 01:30:18.044
        Hey, Goldstein,
  we gonna stop for breakfast?

01:30:18.046 --> 01:30:20.547
 No. We're not. No. We're not.

01:30:20.549 --> 01:30:23.183
You don't know how to have fun.

01:30:24.186 --> 01:30:26.620
