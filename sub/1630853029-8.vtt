Mr. Baker's medical records

30:53.286 --> 30:54.765
from his time
at the State Department?

30:54.809 --> 30:57.420
- I have, and I've also
conducted my own examination.

30:57.464 --> 30:59.466
- And what's your assessment
of his condition?

30:59.509 --> 31:02.077
- Mr. Baker's
symptoms are consistent

31:02.121 --> 31:04.427
with Havana Syndrome,
and those symptoms,

31:04.471 --> 31:06.081
particularly
the more recent ones,

31:06.125 --> 31:08.649
bear a striking
resemblance to CTE,

Chronic Traumatic
Encephalopathy.

31:10.781 --> 31:12.566
- Like what

- Even though Mr. Baker

31:15.134 --> 31:17.614
has never played football
or any other contact sport.

31:17.658 --> 31:19.051
How is that possible?

31:19.094 --> 31:20.791
- When Mr. Baker
first sought treatment

31:20.835 --> 31:22.402
for his Havana Syndrome,

31:22.445 --> 31:25.709
brain scans showed he suffered
multiple severe concussions

31:25.753 --> 31:28.669
as a direct result of whatever
was causing the syndrome.

31:28.712 --> 31:30.497
We know that CTE is caused

31:30.540 --> 31:33.065
by that kind of trauma
to the brain.

31:33.108 --> 31:35.937

are known to be prone

31:35.981 --> 31:38.722

violent outbursts.

31:38.766 --> 31:40.507
Isn't that correct?
- Yes.

31:40.550 --> 31:43.423
The damage to the brain
affects the patient's ability

31:43.466 --> 31:46.165
to control their emotions
and impulses.

31:46.208 --> 31:49.472

32:11.973 --> 32:15.716
- My diagnosis can be inferred
from symptoms and context--

32:15.759 --> 32:18.545
- But currently, the only
scientifically accepted way

32:18.588 --> 32:20.373
to verify the presence
of the disease

32:20.416 --> 32:23.550
is by conducting
a postmortem dissection.

32:23.593 --> 32:24.681

other people claimed

32:31.036 --> 32:33.255

32:33.299 --> 32:34.474
- Correct.

of them blamed their condition

32:37.042 --> 32:39.000
for committing acts
of violence?

32:39.044 --> 32:40.784
- Yes, I believe that's right.

32:40.828 --> 32:42.351
- None of them
strangled the life

32:42.395 --> 32:43.744

human being?

32:43.787 --> 32:46.138

- Sustained.

32:47.052 --> 32:49.184

at Walter Reed.

32:57.932 --> 33:01.892

33:19.171 --> 33:21.260
- Did he go back to work?
