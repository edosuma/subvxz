WEBVTT

00:00.324 --> 00:01.425
My name is Emma Becker.

00:01.435 --> 00:04.293
I grew up in a bunch of foster homes

00:04.327 --> 00:05.894
and then... surprise!... I
find out I have a twin sister.

00:05.929 --> 00:07.209
You want me to take your place... 

00:07.230 --> 00:09.197
I was the pauper, she was the princess.

00:09.232 --> 00:12.000
Being Sutton was a fantasy come true.

00:12.035 --> 00:13.035
It all worked perfectly until that kiss... 

00:13.069 --> 00:14.670
You're not Sutton.

00:14.704 --> 00:16.638
We tried to stay apart,
out of respect for Sutton

00:16.673 --> 00:19.608
and what she had with
Ethan, but we couldn't.

00:19.642 --> 00:21.576
Of course I didn't know, in L.A.,

00:21.611 --> 00:22.945
Sutton had secrets of her own.

00:24.681 --> 00:25.881
Part of me wanted just to run,

00:25.915 --> 00:27.649
but I couldn't leave my new family,

00:27.684 --> 00:29.451
even when I found out
they were keeping the truth

00:29.485 --> 00:30.519
about our birth mother a secret.

00:30.553 --> 00:31.520
The woman's dead.

00:31.554 --> 00:32.521
What are we going to tell her

00:32.555 --> 00:33.555
when she finds out that isn't true?

00:33.589 --> 00:35.357
Then Sutton came back to scottsdale,

00:35.391 --> 00:37.192
and things got dangerous.

00:39.295 --> 00:41.096
Someone tried to kill me!

00:41.130 --> 00:42.497
Next, a woman named Rebecca showed up,

00:42.532 --> 00:43.465
with so many lies of her own.

00:43.499 --> 00:45.067
Sutton went into hiding,

00:45.101 --> 00:46.168
because there was someone out there

00:46.202 --> 00:47.970
willing to kill to keep us a secret.

00:48.004 --> 00:48.524
Who sent you?

00:50.340 --> 00:52.207
Dealer was beaten to death last night.

00:52.241 --> 00:53.275
Ethan was blamed for Derek's murder

00:53.309 --> 00:55.811
and had to go on the run.

00:55.845 --> 00:57.913
This time, when Sutton seduced him,

00:57.947 --> 00:59.781
she wasn't pretending to
be anybody except herself.

00:59.816 --> 01:01.016
I love you. I always have.

01:02.018 --> 01:03.952
I had no idea.

01:03.987 --> 01:05.654
And when Ethan returned, I thought things

01:05.688 --> 01:06.922
would go back to the way they were.

01:06.956 --> 01:08.490
But it didn't work out that way.

01:08.524 --> 01:10.459
- I'm sorry; I can't.
- Why?

01:10.493 --> 01:11.660
I kissed Sutton on the ranch.

01:11.694 --> 01:12.828
But it's over now.

01:12.862 --> 01:15.764
Ethan has feelings for someone else.

01:15.798 --> 01:18.300
Meanwhile, there was
still a killer out there.

01:18.334 --> 01:20.302
If that picture gets
into the wrong hands... 

01:20.336 --> 01:22.304
- I might have a solution.
- Okay.

01:22.338 --> 01:23.405
We're getting married.

01:23.439 --> 01:24.639
Digging into Rebecca's past,

01:24.674 --> 01:26.508
we uncovered another secret.

01:26.542 --> 01:28.143
The love of her life.

01:28.144 --> 01:30.379
She always had a photograph
of his in a locket.

01:30.413 --> 01:32.147
Oh, my God... Ted.

01:32.181 --> 01:34.182
Dad and Rebecca had an affair.

01:34.217 --> 01:35.384
- Kristin, whatever Rebecca said... 
- What does is feel like

01:35.418 --> 01:38.053
building a family on a Mountain of lies?

01:38.087 --> 01:40.055
- You guys need to see this.
- Oh, my God... 

01:40.089 --> 01:42.157
I pronounce you husband and wife.

01:42.191 --> 01:44.026
You're under arrest for
the murder of Derek Rogers.

01:44.060 --> 01:45.227
No! Come with us, please.

01:45.261 --> 01:45.961
I was set up!

01:45.995 --> 01:47.729
Hey, you okay?

01:47.764 --> 01:49.097
So many things I knew.

01:49.132 --> 01:51.133
So many things I still had to find out.

01:53.169 --> 01:54.703
Hi, mom.

01:54.737 --> 01:56.104
It's all working perfectly, Sutton.

02:00.710 --> 02:03.745
Here they come!

02:03.779 --> 02:05.847
Is he guilty?!

02:08.651 --> 02:11.553
Did you text your heart
out to someone about it?!

02:12.722 --> 02:14.689
Is he guilty? Is he guilty?

02:14.724 --> 02:16.691
Can't tell us anything?

02:17.760 --> 02:19.494
Here she comes, over here.

02:19.562 --> 02:21.363
How do you feel about this?

02:21.397 --> 02:23.431
Only a few questions, please,

02:23.466 --> 02:26.568
as I need to get inside
to be with my husband.

02:26.602 --> 02:29.304
Guys, I need a minute.

02:29.338 --> 02:31.273
Save us seats?

02:32.675 --> 02:34.276
God, look at these circles.

02:34.310 --> 02:36.278
No sleep, huh?

02:36.312 --> 02:38.580
It's too much partying.

02:38.614 --> 02:42.150
Especially last night.

02:42.185 --> 02:44.186
I so wanted today to never come.

02:44.220 --> 02:45.954
He's gonna make bail, Emma.

02:45.988 --> 02:47.189
And when he does,

02:47.223 --> 02:48.957
we are all so thoroughly screwed:

02:48.991 --> 02:51.193
Me, Thayer, you;

02:51.227 --> 02:53.094
everyone who put him in jail.

02:53.129 --> 02:55.764
Honestly, I don't really care. I'm sorry,

02:55.798 --> 02:57.132
but I'm here to confront him,

02:57.166 --> 02:58.900
and I just, I need to know why

02:58.935 --> 03:01.036
he would kill Derek

03:01.070 --> 03:03.505
and what that has to
do with my birth mother.

03:03.539 --> 03:04.873
I have one shot,

03:04.907 --> 03:07.709
and I'm gonna go straight for the heart.

03:07.743 --> 03:10.412
If that was supposed to make
me feel better, it didn't.

03:10.446 --> 03:12.414
Sorry.

03:12.448 --> 03:14.716
It's okay.

03:14.750 --> 03:18.453
Why don't you go on ahead? I'll meet you.

03:18.487 --> 03:20.188
Okay.

03:23.159 --> 03:25.193
Sutton, what are you doing here?

03:25.228 --> 03:26.494
Burning curiosity.

03:26.529 --> 03:29.030
Plus I knew that you were
going to confront Alec,

03:29.065 --> 03:30.198
and I wanted to see it.

03:30.233 --> 03:31.399
Okay, well, what if somebody sees you?

03:31.434 --> 03:33.068
This is risky.

03:38.941 --> 03:41.042
Oh, Sutton.

03:42.211 --> 03:45.680
Hi, Rebecca. Excuse me.

03:45.715 --> 03:46.948
Actually, I was hoping I could apologize.

03:46.983 --> 03:49.017
- For what?
- Well, you know,

03:49.051 --> 03:50.719
you were trying to warn me about Alec,

03:50.753 --> 03:51.953
and I refused to believe you.

03:51.988 --> 03:54.589
But see, I, I was... 

03:54.624 --> 03:57.592
I am, I'm in love with him.

03:57.627 --> 04:00.428
And I just think that
he's still being framed.

04:00.463 --> 04:02.330
I'm sure there's a ton
of theories out there.

04:02.365 --> 04:03.565
Now if you'll excuse me,

04:03.599 --> 04:05.500
I'm just gonna go be with my friends.

04:05.534 --> 04:06.635
Of course.

04:12.141 --> 04:15.243
Gotta say, that was quite impressive.

04:15.278 --> 04:17.279
How'd it go with you?

04:19.048 --> 04:23.218
I played nice, just like you suggested.

04:23.252 --> 04:25.186
She thinks that we're
still hot on the trail

04:25.221 --> 04:26.821
of finding our birth mother.

04:26.856 --> 04:28.923
Not going to happen.

04:28.958 --> 04:30.959
Alec is gonna spend tonight in jail,

04:30.993 --> 04:32.827
and many more nights.

04:32.862 --> 04:34.696
In the meantime, Sutton,

04:34.730 --> 04:36.765
I need you to keep getting
closer to your sister.

04:36.799 --> 04:39.034
- Even if I really don't feel it?
- Just do what

04:39.068 --> 04:40.702
I do with Alec.

04:40.736 --> 04:41.836
Pretend that you love him

04:41.871 --> 04:43.038
until he gets thrown in the gas chamber?

04:43.072 --> 04:45.840
Actually, it's lethal injection now.

04:45.875 --> 04:47.042
Wish me luck.

04:52.181 --> 04:55.615
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:12.702 --> 05:13.968
Murder, conspiracy,

05:14.003 --> 05:16.104
failure to cooperate with law enforcement.

05:16.138 --> 05:18.006
I really have no choice in this matter.

05:18.040 --> 05:19.808
Bail is denied.

05:19.842 --> 05:22.043
The defendant will be remanded into custody

05:22.078 --> 05:24.579
until a trial date can be set.

05:24.613 --> 05:25.714
We'll take a ten-minute recess.

05:25.748 --> 05:28.483
You're fired.

05:28.517 --> 05:31.419
Oh, my gosh.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.234
Hey, dad.

05:46.268 --> 05:49.337
Guys, I know this is still awkward,

05:49.372 --> 05:51.172
but the offer stands.

05:51.207 --> 05:53.141
You can stay with me,
there's plenty of room,

05:53.175 --> 05:54.476
and now that your dad's not getting... 

05:54.510 --> 05:56.277
gonna get out any time soon... 

05:56.312 --> 05:57.479
That's okay, Rebecca,
but we're good at home.

05:57.513 --> 05:59.414
- Right, Mads?
- Yeah.

05:59.448 --> 06:02.183
- This must be so tough on you two.
- Yes, it is.

06:02.218 --> 06:03.451
Thanks again for the offer, but we're fine.

06:03.486 --> 06:07.088
Okay.

06:07.123 --> 06:09.290
If your mom would just
talk to me, or listen... 

06:11.193 --> 06:12.360
I have... I have an idea.

06:12.395 --> 06:14.062
Fairway Music Fest is this weekend, right?

06:14.096 --> 06:15.163
You're performing.

06:15.197 --> 06:16.518
- Mm-hmm.
- If you just get her there,

06:16.532 --> 06:18.166
I'll do the rest.

06:24.206 --> 06:27.208
Ted. Thank you for coming.

06:27.243 --> 06:30.044
You and Alec are such good friends.

06:30.079 --> 06:32.480
- Your support means everything to him.
- Mm-hmm.

06:32.515 --> 06:36.050
Ted, does it really have to be this way?

06:36.085 --> 06:38.153
Yeah, it does.

06:38.187 --> 06:39.521
But we have so much in common now.

06:39.555 --> 06:42.056
What we have is what we had,

06:42.091 --> 06:44.159
which was a brief affair
a zillion years ago.

06:44.193 --> 06:45.514
An affair that ruined my marriage.

06:45.528 --> 06:47.195
I thought it was the
lies that you told Kristin

06:47.229 --> 06:48.329
that ruined your marriage.

06:48.364 --> 06:50.331
Hey... 

06:50.366 --> 06:52.233
stay out of my life, Rebecca, you hear me?

06:59.442 --> 07:01.176
It was so weird.

07:01.210 --> 07:03.044
He actually winked at me.

07:03.078 --> 07:05.213
Like he knows something,
or he's ahead of the game.

07:05.247 --> 07:07.282
You can't engage him.

07:07.316 --> 07:09.184
Look, I've always felt that Derek's murder

07:09.218 --> 07:11.119
had something to do with our birth mother.

07:11.153 --> 07:14.122
- I think Alec knows who she is.
- Okay,

07:14.156 --> 07:15.457
you are not going to see
him, do you understand?

07:15.491 --> 07:17.325
All he's gonna do is heap on more lies.

07:17.359 --> 07:19.260
Even behind bars, that man is dangerous.

07:19.295 --> 07:21.496
All right, Mads, come on.

07:21.530 --> 07:24.199
Let's get the car and
meet these guys out front.

07:26.335 --> 07:29.237
What was that all about?

07:29.271 --> 07:31.005
Just something about their father.

07:33.075 --> 07:34.142
Uh-oh.

07:34.176 --> 07:36.277
Awkward.

07:37.413 --> 07:40.114
- Hey.
- Hi.

07:40.149 --> 07:42.283
I didn't see you in the courtroom.

07:42.318 --> 07:43.952
I... I wasn't there.

07:43.986 --> 07:47.889
I had a meeting with my parole officer.

07:47.923 --> 07:51.059
I've been skipping school and, um... 

07:51.093 --> 07:53.728
well, you know.

07:55.531 --> 07:57.799
Wow.

07:57.833 --> 08:00.602
Let him drive the convertible now, huh?

08:00.636 --> 08:02.637
That's pretty serious.

08:06.308 --> 08:09.177
Soon Alec will be convicted,

08:09.211 --> 08:12.213
and I will fleece him in the divorce,

08:12.248 --> 08:13.314
and win back Ted,

08:13.349 --> 08:15.250
and have my family back together again.

08:15.284 --> 08:17.318
Ted and me... 

08:17.353 --> 08:19.320
and my two twin daughters.

08:19.355 --> 08:21.222
The family that should have been.

08:21.257 --> 08:24.859
Mm-hmm.

08:24.894 --> 08:27.161
Do I sense reservation?

08:27.196 --> 08:30.932
It'd just be neater if
I were an only child.

08:30.966 --> 08:32.100
In case you've forgotten,

08:32.134 --> 08:34.702
Emma stole my life, and... 

08:34.736 --> 08:36.871
well, the girl still has it.

08:36.905 --> 08:38.907
- And you know why.
- If Ted ever found out

08:38.941 --> 08:40.909
that you've known I'm your daughter,

08:40.943 --> 08:42.809
and that there are twins,

08:42.845 --> 08:44.746
you wouldn't have a chance.

08:44.780 --> 08:46.648
Another reason to be nice to your sister,

08:46.682 --> 08:49.584
I can tell she and Laurel

08:49.618 --> 08:51.920
- are determined to get Kristin and Ted back together.
- Yeah.

08:51.954 --> 08:55.423
Time heals all wounds.

08:55.457 --> 08:57.659
- Except yours, of course.
- Hmm.

08:57.693 --> 09:00.194
I need you to get back
in there and find out

09:00.229 --> 09:01.362
- what they're planning.
- So you can foil it?

09:01.397 --> 09:02.430
So we can foil it.

09:04.567 --> 09:07.302
Foil.

09:07.336 --> 09:09.470
Such a nice... 

09:09.505 --> 09:11.339
ring to it.

09:14.403 --> 09:20.341
Oh, thank God you're making
dinner. I am just too exhausted.

09:20.375 --> 09:22.110
Where've you been, mom?
You're all dressed up.

09:22.144 --> 09:24.979
I had a drink with Lindsey Ridgeway.

09:25.013 --> 09:27.148
- Who?
- The attorney?

09:28.117 --> 09:29.884
The divorce attorney, yes.

09:31.854 --> 09:33.721
I just want to know

09:33.756 --> 09:35.690
what my rights are, what happens if I file.

09:35.724 --> 09:40.995
What to expect financially and otherwise.

09:41.029 --> 09:44.599
I think dad just wants to talk to you.

09:44.633 --> 09:46.534
I know, sweetie. I know
that's what he wants,

09:46.568 --> 09:49.570
but I just don't know if
that's what I want, and... 

09:49.605 --> 09:51.506
I think, in the meantime,

09:51.540 --> 09:53.641
if he wants to talk, he can... 

09:53.675 --> 09:55.476
do it through Lindsey.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.545
I think I have to get out of this suit.

09:59.314 --> 10:02.183
A broken home.

10:02.217 --> 10:04.085
- Us...
- No, Laurel,

10:04.119 --> 10:05.319
I'm not gonna let that happen.

10:05.354 --> 10:07.088
I have seen broken homes,

10:07.122 --> 10:09.223
and the courts do come in, they take over,

10:09.258 --> 10:10.892
the kids get shafted... 

10:10.926 --> 10:12.794
you know.

10:12.828 --> 10:14.762
Not as much as you do, apparently.

10:21.670 --> 10:23.571
You know, I... 

10:23.605 --> 10:24.705
I have a headache.

10:24.740 --> 10:25.873
I'm gonna just skip dinner.

10:29.611 --> 10:31.579
I know, I know I shouldn't risk being seen,

10:31.613 --> 10:32.713
but this is crazy.

10:32.748 --> 10:34.382
He didn't get out on bail?

10:34.416 --> 10:35.696
What happened in that courtroom?

10:35.717 --> 10:38.753
I don't know. Except
they denied bail and... 

10:40.556 --> 10:42.590
he winked at me.

10:42.624 --> 10:45.259
And he had this little smile,

10:45.294 --> 10:47.361
like he wanted me to know that he was... 

10:47.396 --> 10:50.131
- Ahead of the game?
- Exactly.

10:50.165 --> 10:52.200
This all connects. He knows
about our birth mother.

10:52.234 --> 10:53.334
I am so sure of it.

10:53.368 --> 10:55.203
But if he goes to prison,

10:55.237 --> 10:57.071
then the secrets go with him.

10:57.105 --> 10:58.072
- Maybe.
- Well, I want to know

10:58.106 --> 11:00.141
about this plot you have

11:00.175 --> 11:02.810
to get Ted and Kristin back together.

11:02.845 --> 11:06.514
- Don't tell me that that trail's gone cold, too.
- No.

11:06.548 --> 11:07.849
Saturday night at the club,

11:07.883 --> 11:09.817
they're both going to show
up to watch Laurel perform.

11:09.852 --> 11:11.819
We just think that maybe
their love for their kids

11:11.854 --> 11:13.387
will bring them together.

11:13.422 --> 11:15.323
You know what I think, Emma?

11:15.357 --> 11:17.291
No, what do you think, Sutton?

11:17.326 --> 11:19.527
When our embryos split... 

11:19.561 --> 11:21.562
you got all the heart.

11:41.091 --> 11:42.859
Ethan!

11:46.163 --> 11:47.897
You brought me coffee?

11:47.931 --> 11:48.998
What a guy.

11:49.032 --> 11:50.700
It's for me.

11:50.734 --> 11:51.934
Another late night?

11:51.969 --> 11:53.669
I don't know how this keeps happening.

11:53.704 --> 11:55.638
Look at you, skipping school,

11:55.672 --> 11:57.840
riding around on them bikes way too fast.

11:57.875 --> 11:59.842
Forget juvie, kid, you're
gonna end up in the morgue.

11:59.877 --> 12:02.779
Well, I'll make sure it doesn't
happen in your jurisdiction.

12:02.813 --> 12:05.381
I got to get to work.

12:05.415 --> 12:06.649
You going to be okay?

12:06.683 --> 12:08.651
All right.

12:08.685 --> 12:10.419
Bye.

12:15.692 --> 12:17.360
Dan's a lot of good things,

12:17.394 --> 12:22.064
but the soft touch...
it's not his specialty.

12:22.099 --> 12:24.367
Yeah, you can say that again.

12:24.401 --> 12:27.069
Dan's a lot of good things, but the soft... 

12:27.104 --> 12:29.138
Okay.

12:29.173 --> 12:30.306
Nice smile.

12:31.909 --> 12:33.142
You should use it more often.

12:33.177 --> 12:35.044
Thanks for the advice.

12:35.078 --> 12:37.079
Can you take a little bit more?

12:37.114 --> 12:40.917
Let me guess, get over Sutton.

12:40.951 --> 12:43.719
The exact opposite.

12:43.574 --> 12:45.408
Don't give up on her.

12:45.442 --> 12:46.682
Or yourself. Look at Dan and I.

12:46.710 --> 12:50.380
We almost did, and we found our way back.

12:50.414 --> 12:52.315
You and Sutton can, too.

12:56.320 --> 12:59.122
So they're using the event

12:59.156 --> 13:01.357
to get Ted and Kristin together.

13:01.392 --> 13:04.327
Get them to talk and work things out.

13:04.361 --> 13:06.963
Hmm, which just leaves one question.

13:06.997 --> 13:08.097
Hmm?

13:08.132 --> 13:10.833
What am I wearing to the event?

13:10.868 --> 13:12.101
Considering all the trouble
you're going to cause,

13:12.136 --> 13:13.770
may I suggest a suit of armor?

13:20.010 --> 13:22.712
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:22.746 --> 13:24.614
- It's just...
- It's okay.

13:24.648 --> 13:28.484
I missed so much of your growing up.

13:28.519 --> 13:32.255
Doing my little girl's
hair and playing dress up.

13:34.491 --> 13:35.625
I hope you weren't disappointed

13:35.659 --> 13:37.260
when you found out I was your mother.

13:39.229 --> 13:40.296
No.

13:40.330 --> 13:42.165
No.

13:42.199 --> 13:46.069
This... this has been amazing, Rebecca.

13:46.103 --> 13:49.972
It'll be even more amazing when
you go back to calling me mom.

13:52.009 --> 13:54.877
Okay.

13:54.912 --> 13:56.679
Mom.

14:10.461 --> 14:11.627
Well, this is a surprise.

14:11.662 --> 14:12.729
- Is it?
- Yeah.

14:15.365 --> 14:18.434
You want to know another surprise?

14:18.469 --> 14:21.237
I'm getting pretty good
at telling you two apart.

14:22.473 --> 14:24.107
Emma.

14:30.280 --> 14:33.916
How long have you known about us?

14:33.951 --> 14:36.018
Let's say a while.

14:36.053 --> 14:38.154
Is that why you killed Derek?

14:38.188 --> 14:41.090
To protect the secret?

14:41.125 --> 14:42.725
This all connects, doesn't it?

14:42.760 --> 14:45.595
You know who my birth mother is.

14:45.629 --> 14:48.865
Your birth mother?

14:48.899 --> 14:50.800
I thought you weren't
interested in your birth mother,

14:50.834 --> 14:53.469
I mean, since you found
Ted and Kristin and all.

14:56.707 --> 14:58.641
Look at you.

14:58.675 --> 15:02.078
Sitting there all confused.

15:02.112 --> 15:06.349
You're wondering why you
don't just confess it all.

15:06.383 --> 15:08.151
Just come clean.

15:08.185 --> 15:10.052
You know you can't.

15:10.087 --> 15:11.954
You know why.

15:11.989 --> 15:14.957
It'll destroy the only
family you've ever had.

15:14.992 --> 15:18.828
I know why I can't say anything.

15:18.862 --> 15:22.765
But what is stopping you
from saying something?

15:22.800 --> 15:26.669
When I get out of here...
and I will get out of here...

15:26.703 --> 15:27.904
maybe I'll tell you.

15:27.938 --> 15:31.541
That's not good enough!

15:31.575 --> 15:32.642
I need answers.

15:32.676 --> 15:34.577
You need to tell me something.

15:34.611 --> 15:36.512
Okay.

15:36.547 --> 15:39.816
How about this?

15:39.850 --> 15:41.684
I wouldn't trust Sutton.

15:45.489 --> 15:50.092
She might not be as much
on your side as you think.

16:11.251 --> 16:14.187
Everything okay?

16:14.221 --> 16:15.922
Just threw a chain.

16:15.956 --> 16:17.023
Almost got it back on.

16:17.057 --> 16:18.024
Hmm.

16:18.058 --> 16:19.659
How'd you know I was out here?

16:19.693 --> 16:20.960
Oh, I was just in the neighborhood.

16:20.994 --> 16:22.562
Oh, that's pretty convenient.

16:22.596 --> 16:24.530
I remember you used to come up here

16:24.565 --> 16:26.566
when you needed to blow off steam.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.701
We used to come up here.

16:30.704 --> 16:32.538
Come here.

16:32.573 --> 16:34.440
Here.

16:34.475 --> 16:36.509
Need you to hold this bolt in place.

16:36.543 --> 16:38.344
Grab the wrench.

16:38.378 --> 16:39.512
Hold it there, tight.

16:39.546 --> 16:41.681
Yeah, good.

16:41.715 --> 16:43.549
So I'm sure you've already heard,

16:43.584 --> 16:46.552
I am letting Emma keep my
life for a little bit longer.

16:46.587 --> 16:48.521
She needs to get our parents back together,

16:48.555 --> 16:50.156
and I respect that.

16:52.159 --> 16:53.493
I got it.

16:53.527 --> 16:57.296
You don't want me to talk about Emma.

16:57.331 --> 16:59.098
I don't want to talk about Emma.

16:59.133 --> 17:00.233
Okay? Or you, or myself.

17:02.035 --> 17:03.269
Okay.

17:05.239 --> 17:08.840
Hey, let's go for a ride.

17:08.876 --> 17:11.042
You have to have a helmet.

17:11.078 --> 17:15.047
Oh, I just so happen
to have one in the car.

17:15.082 --> 17:16.048
Really?

17:16.083 --> 17:17.817
Come on, what do you say?

17:17.851 --> 17:20.653
For old times' sake.

18:10.237 --> 18:12.205
What, you're just giving up?

18:12.239 --> 18:14.974
Think you know why.

18:15.008 --> 18:17.009
Oh, is it too dangerous for you?

18:17.044 --> 18:19.212
Sutton, get on the bike; I'm
taking you back to your car.

18:19.246 --> 18:21.747
No. Since when has danger ever stopped you?

18:21.782 --> 18:23.983
Come on, tell me you didn't enjoy that.

18:24.017 --> 18:25.885
All right, get on the bike.

18:25.919 --> 18:27.019
No... get on... 

18:27.054 --> 18:28.821
Ow!

18:28.856 --> 18:30.022
Hey, what happened?

18:30.057 --> 18:32.825
- Ow, my ankle.
- You all right?

18:32.860 --> 18:34.861
Ow!

18:36.797 --> 18:38.731
Are you kidding me?

18:38.765 --> 18:40.733
I can't believe you went there.

18:40.767 --> 18:41.834
I told you not to.

18:41.869 --> 18:43.669
I told you what would happen, come on.

18:43.704 --> 18:45.471
Sorry.

18:45.505 --> 18:46.806
He knows.

18:46.840 --> 18:50.710
He knows about me and
Sutton, that we're twins,

18:50.744 --> 18:52.378
our names, the switches.

18:52.412 --> 18:54.480
We suspected that from the beginning.

18:54.514 --> 18:56.182
He told me that I can't trust Sutton,

18:56.216 --> 18:57.256
that she's not on our side.

18:57.284 --> 18:58.517
What does that mean?

18:58.552 --> 19:00.486
Either he knows something
or he suspects something.

19:00.520 --> 19:03.289
Either way, he is messing with you.

19:06.994 --> 19:09.328
You're probably wondering
why I asked you here.

19:09.363 --> 19:11.230
The thought crossed my mind,

19:11.265 --> 19:13.933
as I was instrumental in putting you here.

19:13.967 --> 19:15.902
Yeah.

19:16.970 --> 19:18.905
I want you to represent me.

19:21.708 --> 19:22.875
This has to be a joke.

19:22.910 --> 19:25.878
No... that was my last attorney.

19:27.547 --> 19:29.448
I've decided I need someone

19:29.483 --> 19:30.549
familiar with the evidence

19:30.584 --> 19:33.452
and absolutely convinced of my guilt.

19:34.788 --> 19:37.356
If I can persuade that person,

19:37.391 --> 19:39.425
I can persuade a judge and jury.

19:39.459 --> 19:42.395
Well, I don't think...
at least in my case...

19:42.429 --> 19:45.131
that's even a remote possibility.

19:45.165 --> 19:47.466
Have a seat.

19:47.501 --> 19:49.101
Let me try?

19:51.004 --> 19:52.204
Go on, sit down.

19:52.239 --> 19:55.241
It's a rather long and complicated story.

20:11.692 --> 20:13.626
So, what did he want?

20:13.660 --> 20:15.594
He wants me to represent him.

20:15.629 --> 20:18.564
He's even further gone than I thought.

20:18.598 --> 20:19.632
I told him I would.

20:19.666 --> 20:21.867
What?

20:21.902 --> 20:23.803
Theresa, I... I get the "everyone
needs fair representation" idea.

20:23.837 --> 20:28.674
There is compelling evidence
that he didn't do this,

20:28.709 --> 20:30.476
that he was framed.

20:30.510 --> 20:33.479
Oh, okay.

20:33.513 --> 20:35.348
So what's the evidence?

20:35.382 --> 20:37.183
I can't tell you.

20:38.218 --> 20:39.986
Attorney-client privilege... 

20:40.020 --> 20:42.021
Right.

20:42.055 --> 20:43.122
I'm sorry.

20:48.161 --> 20:50.229
You know, you're so great for doing this.

20:50.263 --> 20:51.931
Thank you.

20:51.965 --> 20:55.134
Well, anybody sees
Sutton Mercer in the E.R.,

20:55.168 --> 20:56.936
you and Emma are out.

20:56.970 --> 20:58.037
Why do you care?

20:58.071 --> 20:59.905
Emma has already

20:59.940 --> 21:02.942
made it very clear that she
wants nothing to do with you,

21:02.976 --> 21:06.779
and Thayer just seems
to be moving right in.

21:06.813 --> 21:08.581
You're going to need
something for the pain.

21:08.615 --> 21:10.850
You have any aspirin or
ibuprofen around here?

21:10.884 --> 21:13.452
There's a first aid kit in that corner.

21:13.487 --> 21:16.522
Ethan, can I ask you something?

21:16.556 --> 21:18.691
Do you think that some things... 

21:18.725 --> 21:22.495
Or maybe even all things...
happen for a reason

21:22.529 --> 21:24.497
and there aren't any accidents?

21:24.531 --> 21:27.266
I don't know.

21:27.300 --> 21:29.201
Well, I'm pretty sure

21:29.236 --> 21:30.403
that's what native Americans believe.

21:30.437 --> 21:34.073
I saw it in a movie once.

21:34.107 --> 21:36.909
Pocahontas is not the
quintessential history

21:36.943 --> 21:38.077
of the Native American.

21:38.111 --> 21:40.079
Okay.

21:40.113 --> 21:43.983
It's just that, today on the
side of the road, I saw you,

21:44.017 --> 21:47.586
and then the guy on
the motorcycle drove by,

21:47.621 --> 21:48.754
and my ankle.

21:48.789 --> 21:50.656
Yeah, you're gonna need to stay off of it

21:50.690 --> 21:51.957
for about a day, okay?

21:55.529 --> 21:58.597
So you don't believe in destiny?

21:58.632 --> 22:00.332
I can't.

22:00.367 --> 22:02.668
I've been burned by it too many times.

22:11.028 --> 22:13.963
You're upset because I asked
to see Emma and not you?

22:13.998 --> 22:15.932
You are messing with her head.

22:15.966 --> 22:19.869
I told her not to trust her sister.

22:19.903 --> 22:21.938
That's valid advice.

22:21.972 --> 22:23.973
- How long have you known about the twins?
- Immaterial.

22:24.008 --> 22:25.942
Not to me, and not to Emma.

22:25.976 --> 22:27.644
I didn't tell her anything else.

22:27.678 --> 22:29.746
I'm sure as hell not going to tell you.

22:31.515 --> 22:34.450
You two pretty tight now, aren't you?

22:34.485 --> 22:36.285
- Yeah.
- When did that happen?

22:36.320 --> 22:38.254
Oh, let me guess.

22:38.288 --> 22:40.456
Right about the same time

22:40.491 --> 22:44.360
you were both plotting to throw me in jail.

22:49.033 --> 22:51.134
One sister.

22:51.168 --> 22:53.770
Then the other.

22:53.804 --> 22:56.005
You going back and forth between the two?

23:01.045 --> 23:02.712
I'd watch that temper, son.

23:02.746 --> 23:04.426
It could get you into all kinds of trouble.

23:34.378 --> 23:36.279
Hi.

23:38.415 --> 23:41.284
Hi.

23:41.318 --> 23:43.352
Clearly, you were expecting Ethan.

23:43.387 --> 23:45.088
He, uh... 

23:45.122 --> 23:46.889
he has to work the Fairway Fest tonight.

23:46.924 --> 23:48.891
Oh. That's happening already?

23:48.926 --> 23:51.094
So, how's it feeling? Any better?

23:51.128 --> 23:55.665
Ew. It's throbbing.

23:55.699 --> 23:57.700
You know, I definitely
have some ankle experience.

23:57.735 --> 23:59.035
All that dancing. I've seen my fair share

23:59.069 --> 24:01.504
of twists and sprains. Maybe
I should take a look at it.

24:01.538 --> 24:03.773
Oh, no need. Ethan has me
all set up here with the ice,

24:03.841 --> 24:05.608
and... 

24:05.642 --> 24:07.443
pillows.

24:07.478 --> 24:10.480
- He is such a Saint, that guy.
- Mm-hmm.

24:10.514 --> 24:12.682
He is so available now.

24:12.716 --> 24:15.384
Well, thank you for the food,
and that's a great dress.

24:15.419 --> 24:17.186
Hmm.

24:17.221 --> 24:19.455
- Going fishing tonight?
- No.

24:19.490 --> 24:22.158
No fishing. Just, uh,
gonna go have a good time.

24:22.192 --> 24:23.960
Right.

24:23.994 --> 24:27.163
Everybody's trying to
get on with their lives.

24:27.197 --> 24:28.331
I'm not sure I'd be able

24:28.365 --> 24:31.934
to get on with my life if I
knew my dad was a murderer.

24:31.969 --> 24:33.035
What's that like?

24:33.070 --> 24:34.737
I bet not half as difficult

24:34.772 --> 24:35.938
as faking an ankle sprain,

24:35.973 --> 24:38.074
trying to get Ethan into bed with you.

24:38.108 --> 24:40.943
Have a nice night, Sutton.

24:50.921 --> 24:54.524
Thanks.

24:57.528 --> 24:59.729
Look who's here.

25:03.534 --> 25:06.302
It was a nice move back on East 80.

25:06.336 --> 25:07.737
I'm a little surprised you're
still in one piece, though.

25:07.771 --> 25:10.339
So that was you in my rearview mirror.

25:10.374 --> 25:12.508
Let me guess. You were
the girl on the back.

25:15.245 --> 25:16.546
Probably.

25:16.580 --> 25:19.148
California plates?

25:19.183 --> 25:20.082
You new in town?

25:20.117 --> 25:22.051
Could be.

25:22.085 --> 25:23.986
I'm Jordan.

25:24.021 --> 25:26.255
Hi. Sutton Mercer.

25:26.290 --> 25:27.890
This is Ethan Whitehorse.

25:27.925 --> 25:29.025
Cute couple.

25:29.059 --> 25:30.193
Not anymore.

25:33.030 --> 25:36.933
Careful. It's probably a little
more power than you're used to.

25:36.967 --> 25:40.570
So, Jordan, are you a member here?

25:40.604 --> 25:42.605
No, but never stopped me before.

25:45.742 --> 25:47.844
I like that guy.

25:50.981 --> 25:52.748
- What?!
- You heard me.

25:52.783 --> 25:55.751
I need you to hit me in the
ankle with this firewood.

25:55.786 --> 25:57.486
- You've lost your mind.
- No.

25:57.521 --> 25:59.655
The swelling has gone down, my
ankle is better, and if Ethan

25:59.690 --> 26:02.491
finds out that I'm faking
it, I am back to square one.

26:02.526 --> 26:04.660
Okay, this is not the way to go about it.

26:04.695 --> 26:06.495
You've set yourself up for failure.

26:06.530 --> 26:10.299
I don't see what you're
doing is any different.

26:10.334 --> 26:11.367
I don't have a choice.

26:12.436 --> 26:15.037
When you went up to the ranch... 

26:15.072 --> 26:17.240
What happened?

26:17.274 --> 26:20.109
We... connected.

26:20.143 --> 26:21.310
How?

26:21.345 --> 26:22.912
Why?

26:22.946 --> 26:24.881
I stopped playing games.

26:24.915 --> 26:27.016
Because you were honest.

26:27.050 --> 26:31.787
Sometimes I wonder if I'd
been more honest with Ted... 

26:31.822 --> 26:34.657
that this might have all
turned out very differently.

26:34.691 --> 26:38.527
Well, honesty isn't exactly my forte.

26:38.562 --> 26:40.730
Nor is it mine.

26:40.764 --> 26:43.733
I guess it's another case of
like mother, like daughter.

26:43.767 --> 26:48.271
If that's true, then how come
it comes so easily for Emma?

26:51.275 --> 26:53.509
I don't know who he is. Jordan somebody.

26:53.543 --> 26:55.544
Hmm. Ethan seemed to know him, though.

26:55.579 --> 26:57.213
He mentioned something

26:57.247 --> 26:59.415
about me being on the back of Ethan's bike.

26:59.449 --> 27:01.350
Hmm. Well, it was probably Sutton.

27:01.385 --> 27:03.119
She twisted her ankle.

27:03.153 --> 27:04.921
Actually, she faked a twisted ankle,

27:04.955 --> 27:06.355
setting up an heroic rescue by Ethan.

27:06.390 --> 27:08.291
Wait a minute. Where's Thayer?

27:08.325 --> 27:10.893
I thought he was supposed to come with you.

27:10.928 --> 27:12.962
He left me a voice mail to meet him here.

27:12.996 --> 27:14.263
Oh.

27:14.298 --> 27:17.166
This thing with your dad
has kind of made him crazy.

27:17.200 --> 27:20.836
Yeah, the thing about Thayer
is, he is such a good guy,

27:20.871 --> 27:23.005
but he also has this
major chip on his shoulder.

27:23.040 --> 27:24.640
About your dad?

27:24.675 --> 27:26.542
I'll let him tell you.

27:26.576 --> 27:28.611
God, I am so sick of this.

27:28.645 --> 27:30.813
Just pretending like nothing's happened.

27:30.847 --> 27:32.615
Dressing up and smiling

27:32.649 --> 27:34.383
while everyone's whispering behind my back.

27:34.418 --> 27:35.584
"Her dad killed someone."

27:35.619 --> 27:37.386
You want to get something to drink?

27:37.421 --> 27:39.388
Uh-huh.

27:39.423 --> 27:41.357
But probably not what you're offering.

27:44.561 --> 27:47.396
Oh, hello, judge.

27:47.431 --> 27:50.032
You got my contribution?

27:50.067 --> 27:53.936
Uh, you were very generous, Mrs. Rybak.

28:07.117 --> 28:08.651
Hi. What can I get you?

28:08.685 --> 28:09.919
Vodka tonic and Chardonnay.

28:09.953 --> 28:12.054
Okay. Vodka tonic and
Chardonnay coming right up.

28:12.089 --> 28:13.055
Thanks.

28:18.628 --> 28:20.663
Kristin.

28:20.697 --> 28:22.865
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm fine, Rebecca.

28:22.899 --> 28:24.533
How are you?

28:24.568 --> 28:26.669
Well, now that you ask, uh... 

28:26.703 --> 28:29.305
hasn't really been that easy.

28:31.341 --> 28:32.541
Well, I imagine it hasn't been.

28:32.576 --> 28:34.377
How's Alec?

28:36.446 --> 28:39.015
Kristin... 

28:39.049 --> 28:40.316
I never really had a chance

28:40.350 --> 28:43.019
to tell you how sorry I am for the affair

28:43.053 --> 28:45.755
and how you found out.

28:45.789 --> 28:48.858
It was such a long time ago.

28:48.892 --> 28:50.693
And there's really no excuse.

28:50.727 --> 28:51.961
It... just happened.

28:51.995 --> 28:54.897
And you and Ted were going

28:54.931 --> 28:56.832
through all that fertility stuff, and... 

29:00.404 --> 29:01.781
I'm sorry.

29:03.220 --> 29:06.409
- I really shouldn't go on like that.
- No, please. Go on.

29:06.443 --> 29:09.245
So, Ted told you about that?

29:09.279 --> 29:12.248
Well, yes.

29:12.282 --> 29:14.250
And how difficult it was,

29:14.284 --> 29:15.985
especially on you.

29:16.019 --> 29:17.887
You seem surprised.

29:17.921 --> 29:20.222
Well, I guess I just assumed... 

29:20.257 --> 29:22.758
It was only about the sex?

29:22.793 --> 29:25.961
Huh.

29:25.996 --> 29:28.631
I'm sorry.

29:28.665 --> 29:31.734
I know you're trying
to fix things with Ted.

29:31.768 --> 29:34.470
Forget I said anything.

29:34.504 --> 29:37.706
Oh, I will.

29:53.197 --> 29:55.198
Hi. There you are.

29:55.232 --> 29:57.066
Sorry, I'm late.

29:57.101 --> 29:58.768
It's okay. What's up?

29:58.802 --> 30:00.737
Nothing.

30:00.771 --> 30:03.106
Uh, just a bunch of hassles.

30:03.140 --> 30:06.075
Hey, I'm gonna grab us a
blanket and some food, okay?

30:06.110 --> 30:09.045
Okay.

30:10.080 --> 30:13.583
Mom. Excuse me. Hi.

30:13.617 --> 30:15.618
- Hey, sweetie.
- Thank you so much for coming.

30:15.652 --> 30:17.487
It means the world to Laurel.

30:19.490 --> 30:20.523
Hi, Kristin.

30:20.557 --> 30:22.692
Hi.

30:22.726 --> 30:24.594
As always,

30:24.628 --> 30:26.295
you look amazing.

30:28.365 --> 30:30.433
Well, thank you, Ted.

30:38.408 --> 30:40.943
Think that's a good idea?

30:40.978 --> 30:42.145
It's a really rotten idea,

30:42.179 --> 30:44.180
and I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone.

30:45.916 --> 30:48.951
Did you know that there are still reporters

30:48.986 --> 30:50.887
camped out in front of our house?

30:50.921 --> 30:54.557
Thayer and I sneak out the back.

30:54.591 --> 30:56.926
And Ryan dumped me... day one.

30:56.960 --> 31:00.596
He said that we should have
gone straight to our dad

31:00.631 --> 31:02.765
with our suspicions, instead of the cops.

31:02.800 --> 31:06.402
Guys can be so judgmental.

31:06.436 --> 31:10.473
I hate him, even though
part of me knows he's right.

31:13.243 --> 31:14.277
Do you want some?

31:14.311 --> 31:16.479
Um... I can't.

31:16.513 --> 31:18.347
Oh. 

31:18.382 --> 31:20.316
Right, 'cause you're on duty, huh?

31:20.350 --> 31:22.051
And when you're not on duty... 

31:22.085 --> 31:24.053
you're skipping school,

31:24.087 --> 31:27.089
speeding around on that bike
of yours and injuring people.

31:27.124 --> 31:29.025
Whatever.

31:29.059 --> 31:32.628
Hmm. Yeah, those twins
have driven you crazy.

31:32.663 --> 31:33.729
Just about.

31:33.764 --> 31:34.897
At this point, you got to know

31:34.932 --> 31:36.532
Sutton's faking the ankle.

31:36.567 --> 31:37.700
Yeah, I know.

31:37.734 --> 31:39.735
And you just let her?

31:41.872 --> 31:46.509
Why do you allow yourself to be
continually punked by that girl?

31:46.543 --> 31:48.644
Mads, I've got it under control.

31:50.380 --> 31:53.349
But thank you for your concern.

31:53.383 --> 31:56.252
Well, I feel like doing
something crazy, so... 

31:58.222 --> 32:01.057
- All right, well, be careful.
- Oh.

32:01.091 --> 32:03.192
Never.

32:09.366 --> 32:12.068
Excuse me, sir? Are you a member?

32:12.102 --> 32:15.238
Actually, uh, he's with me.

32:15.272 --> 32:18.774
There you are, handsome.

32:18.809 --> 32:20.710
I'm sorry. Is there a problem?

32:20.744 --> 32:22.612
My apologies, sir.

32:26.550 --> 32:27.850
Maybe I should introduce myself.

32:27.885 --> 32:31.888
Maybe you shouldn't.

32:40.397 --> 32:43.666
Seems to be working.

32:43.700 --> 32:47.336
Although Kristin is
being a little bit weird.

32:49.339 --> 32:53.175
And so are you. Are you okay?

32:53.210 --> 32:55.244
You've been so quiet.

32:55.279 --> 32:57.480
Yeah, I'm good. I'm okay.

32:57.514 --> 33:00.449
Just looking forward to the show.

33:00.484 --> 33:02.351
I hope this all works.

33:06.256 --> 33:10.059
* Dark clouds overhead

33:10.093 --> 33:11.827
* made a home

33:11.862 --> 33:14.964
* over our bed

33:14.998 --> 33:18.734
* I mistook them for mystery

33:18.769 --> 33:21.804
* like the love stories

33:21.838 --> 33:24.840
* I'd read

33:24.875 --> 33:28.678
* and wouldn't you know

33:28.712 --> 33:30.813
* it turned out to be

33:30.847 --> 33:34.483
* a tragedy... 

33:34.518 --> 33:36.652
Look at her. She's incredible.

33:36.687 --> 33:39.322
- I can't believe we created that.
- I can't believe

33:39.356 --> 33:40.423
you were with Rebecca

33:40.457 --> 33:42.224
when we were trying to create that.

33:42.259 --> 33:45.294
Kristin, please don't do this.

33:45.329 --> 33:47.163
It's true.

33:47.197 --> 33:49.065
You had a relationship with her.

33:49.099 --> 33:51.033
It... it was just a brief affair.

33:51.068 --> 33:54.003
You talked to her about us, about me.

33:54.037 --> 33:56.973
What, our life was so horrible

33:57.007 --> 33:59.075
you needed this other woman to stroke

33:59.109 --> 34:01.143
your ego, give you a shoulder to cry on?

34:01.178 --> 34:02.979
- That's not true.
- It is.

34:03.013 --> 34:05.047
I can see it. I do see it on your face.

34:05.082 --> 34:07.083
It wasn't just a sex
thing, a one-night stand.

34:07.117 --> 34:09.685
- It was deeper, it was much deeper than this.
- Okay,

34:09.719 --> 34:10.760
whatever it was, I'm sorry.

34:10.786 --> 34:11.786
I never loved her. I love you.

34:11.822 --> 34:12.955
Love.

34:14.891 --> 34:16.759
God, I don't even know
what that is anymore.

34:16.793 --> 34:18.694
You know what? No. I am not leaving.

34:18.728 --> 34:21.429
You leave, Ted. I came here
to see my daughter perform,

34:21.465 --> 34:22.625
and that's what I'm gonna do.

34:32.376 --> 34:34.110
Mom... 

34:34.143 --> 34:36.312
What happened? We can fix it.

34:36.346 --> 34:38.280
Nothing can fix this.

35:00.070 --> 35:02.204
What are you waiting for?

35:02.239 --> 35:04.006
It's delicious in here.

35:21.758 --> 35:23.692
I really think we need
a proper introduction.

35:23.727 --> 35:25.461
I agree.

35:25.495 --> 35:26.695
How about I'll be lost... 

35:33.437 --> 35:35.404
and you be found?

35:50.761 --> 35:52.528
So...  when are you gonna
tell me what's going on?

35:52.562 --> 35:55.464
I went to visit my dad today.

35:55.499 --> 35:57.433
I couldn't let him get away

35:57.467 --> 35:59.235
with messing with your head.

35:59.269 --> 36:01.137
And now he's messing with yours.

36:01.171 --> 36:02.438
Maybe he is.

36:02.472 --> 36:05.374
He said some things.

36:05.409 --> 36:08.144
Not about the murder, or
knowing about the twins.

36:08.178 --> 36:10.913
Just other things.

36:10.947 --> 36:12.848
About me and you.

36:12.883 --> 36:15.751
I just want you to know that I'm not

36:15.786 --> 36:17.920
playing some kind of a game here.

36:17.954 --> 36:20.523
My feelings for you have
nothing to do with Sutton.

36:22.526 --> 36:24.627
We had whatever we had in L.A.,

36:24.661 --> 36:27.530
but when I got back here and I met you... 

36:27.564 --> 36:31.267
and I saw with Mads, and your family,

36:31.301 --> 36:34.170
I knew that I had found
someone real and genuine.

36:40.477 --> 36:44.246
I feel the same way.

36:44.281 --> 36:46.348
That's good.

36:48.185 --> 36:50.186
You know, all this stuff
kind of threw us together,

36:50.220 --> 36:52.888
so we never really talked about it.

36:52.923 --> 36:55.691
I know. I promised myself
I wouldn't overthink it.

36:55.725 --> 36:56.926
Which is exactly

36:56.960 --> 36:58.594
- what I'm doing.
- No.

36:58.628 --> 37:00.729
You're, you're... 

37:00.764 --> 37:02.832
you're being honest.

37:02.866 --> 37:05.868
That's really hard to find around here.

37:27.390 --> 37:30.059
So?

37:30.093 --> 37:32.995
Yes, I was faking.

37:33.029 --> 37:34.930
Not in the beginning.

37:34.965 --> 37:36.832
Pretty soon after.

37:36.867 --> 37:40.636
And enough time to make it unforgivable.

37:40.670 --> 37:42.671
You got that right.

37:42.706 --> 37:45.574
You might want to get out
of here before Dan gets home.

37:45.609 --> 37:47.776
Ethan, please wait, and... 

37:47.811 --> 37:49.512
let me... 

37:50.780 --> 37:53.516
try my honesty card.

37:53.550 --> 37:55.551
I faked the ankle because

37:55.585 --> 37:58.521
I couldn't watch you self-destruct.

37:58.555 --> 38:00.389
And what?

38:00.423 --> 38:01.590
Your little sprained ankle

38:01.625 --> 38:04.160
is gonna somehow give
me something to live for?

38:04.194 --> 38:06.328
No.

38:07.464 --> 38:10.399
It would give me someone to talk to.

38:12.402 --> 38:14.370
I miss you.

38:14.404 --> 38:16.906
And I know you are... 

38:16.940 --> 38:18.107
trying to get over Emma,

38:18.141 --> 38:19.875
but we had something.

38:19.910 --> 38:21.944
Up at the ranch, and even before then,

38:21.978 --> 38:25.047
before Emma even got
here, we had something.

38:25.081 --> 38:27.716
We were just... 

38:27.751 --> 38:29.818
crazy, and we were good.

38:29.853 --> 38:32.454
Really good.

38:32.489 --> 38:34.723
We escaped our lives together.

38:34.758 --> 38:37.426
And I tried to get over it,

38:37.460 --> 38:39.395
and to move on,

38:39.429 --> 38:41.297
but the truth is, Ethan,

38:41.331 --> 38:44.300
I... 

38:44.334 --> 38:46.569
I fell in love with you.

38:46.603 --> 38:50.372
And I'm still in love with you.

38:53.043 --> 38:54.276
And I can't shake it,

38:54.311 --> 38:55.411
and I don't think... 

38:55.445 --> 38:58.080
you can either.

39:11.828 --> 39:13.796
Good night, Sutton.

39:25.642 --> 39:28.577
I hate this.

39:28.612 --> 39:30.546
Not being able to touch you.

39:32.382 --> 39:35.084
Thanks for seeing me.

39:35.118 --> 39:36.418
I know it's late.

39:36.453 --> 39:39.321
I tried before. Did they tell you?

39:39.356 --> 39:41.223
Yeah.

39:41.258 --> 39:42.925
I just hadn't... 

39:42.959 --> 39:45.761
felt much like having visitors, you know?

39:45.795 --> 39:47.062
I was so shocked at the bail hearing.

39:47.097 --> 39:49.098
I thought for sure they'd let you out.

39:49.132 --> 39:51.900
And now they told me that... 

39:51.935 --> 39:53.902
Dan's girlfriend is your new attorney.

39:53.937 --> 39:55.671
She's good.

39:55.705 --> 39:58.440
Real straight shooter. No B.S.

39:58.475 --> 40:00.743
You know, she comes out both guns blazing.

40:00.777 --> 40:03.679
I think she'll do fine.

40:05.615 --> 40:07.716
So you're confident?

40:07.751 --> 40:10.319
I'll be out of here in no time at all.

40:11.655 --> 40:15.257
Well, thank God.

40:18.161 --> 40:19.928
You know, we'd be coming home

40:19.963 --> 40:22.264
from our honeymoon right about now.

40:22.299 --> 40:24.867
I know.

40:24.901 --> 40:27.970
You keep that bed warm for me, okay?

40:30.840 --> 40:33.008
Alec... 

40:33.043 --> 40:35.878
"Oh, Alec" what?

40:35.912 --> 40:38.947
I just don't know how I'm
gonna survive all of this.

40:38.982 --> 40:43.552
I've been wondering the exact same thing.

40:44.954 --> 40:47.456
Give him a chance? I did more than that.

40:47.490 --> 40:48.791
And what was the first
thing out of his mouth?

40:48.825 --> 40:51.493
- A big fat lie.
- Mom, he made a mistake.

40:51.528 --> 40:52.761
The lie was tonight, Sutton.

40:52.796 --> 40:54.296
Right to my face.

40:54.331 --> 40:55.564
Maybe Rebecca was lying.

40:55.598 --> 40:57.399
I don't want to talk about this.

40:58.702 --> 41:01.170
Oh, sweetie, please, I'm so sorry.

41:01.204 --> 41:03.405
I'm so sorry we ruined your night.

41:03.440 --> 41:04.406
That's okay.

41:04.441 --> 41:06.141
No, it's not.

41:06.176 --> 41:08.477
You were up there
singing, it was so lovely,

41:08.511 --> 41:12.014
and we just, we made a mess of it.

41:12.048 --> 41:13.148
I don't care.

41:13.183 --> 41:16.318
Sutton and I just wanted this
to be a night to heal and...

41:16.353 --> 41:18.320
now the problem seems worse.

41:18.355 --> 41:20.122
Sweetie, you have to leave this alone.

41:20.156 --> 41:22.858
You both do.

41:22.892 --> 41:24.193
What happened between you father and me

41:24.227 --> 41:26.762
is, is a mess, but it's our mess,

41:26.796 --> 41:28.764
not yours.

41:33.136 --> 41:35.003
Mads?

41:37.874 --> 41:40.075
- What happened?
- Hey, sorry.

41:40.110 --> 41:42.745
Uh, I did something crazy and stupid.

41:42.779 --> 41:44.913
It's getting to be a habit with me.

41:44.948 --> 41:47.583
Kristin... 

41:47.617 --> 41:49.551
uh, I was just wondering if maybe,

41:49.586 --> 41:52.988
um, I could take you up on that offer.

41:53.022 --> 41:56.859
Sweetie, to move in here? Of course.

41:56.893 --> 41:58.994
Yeah, that'd be awesome.

41:59.028 --> 42:01.897
Absolutely.

42:04.033 --> 42:05.033
It totally worked.

42:05.034 --> 42:06.769
The whole honesty thing.

42:06.803 --> 42:10.005
It was very inspired. You are inspired.

42:10.039 --> 42:11.740
Thank you, mom.

42:11.775 --> 42:13.642
So does that mean you and Ethan?

42:13.676 --> 42:15.711
Nothing huge,

42:15.745 --> 42:17.746
but a tiny step closer.

42:17.781 --> 42:19.915
Definitely closer.

42:21.618 --> 42:23.652
Oh, my gosh. Ted?

42:23.686 --> 42:24.920
That's be perfect. Go... 

42:24.954 --> 42:26.688
Hide.

42:35.765 --> 42:36.799
Hi, mom.

42:36.833 --> 42:38.667
Jordan.
