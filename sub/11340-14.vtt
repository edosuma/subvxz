00:20.314 --> 00:23.202
To the class of 2012,

00:23.203 --> 00:25.932
may the world end after
we've had our fun in college,

00:25.934 --> 00:27.318
not before.

00:42.918 --> 00:46.337
I can't believe
that this time next year

00:46.421 --> 00:48.506
you're gonna be
so far away.

00:48.590 --> 00:51.342
Well, I'm here now.
That's what matters.

00:51.426 --> 00:54.345
I know, but...

00:54.429 --> 00:57.014
You're gonna meet some hot
sorority slut and--

00:57.099 --> 00:59.667
And you're gonna meet
some hot frat guy.

00:59.734 --> 01:01.185
In the chemistry department?

01:01.269 --> 01:02.353
Yeah, right.

01:02.437 --> 01:03.804
Just remember,

01:03.855 --> 01:06.640
you're gonna be
a hot sorority slut, too.

01:06.691 --> 01:08.309
I am not a slut.

01:09.478 --> 01:10.895
Don't I know it.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.534
Come on.

01:16.618 --> 01:17.785
Where are you going?

01:17.852 --> 01:19.904
To test your theory.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.390
Wait.

01:39.474 --> 01:41.142
You're always
gonna be my guy...

01:41.209 --> 01:42.693
Right, Johnny?

01:43.895 --> 01:46.897
As long as you're always
gonna be my girl.

02:01.496 --> 02:02.947
What is that?

02:07.068 --> 02:09.336
It's coming from
inside the tower.

02:11.173 --> 02:13.407
Johnny!
Wait here.

02:35.864 --> 02:36.981
Johnny.

03:11.683 --> 03:12.799
Stay back.

03:18.456 --> 03:21.492
Aah! Aah!

03:21.576 --> 03:23.260
Aah!

03:24.913 --> 03:26.202
Is that all you got?

03:26.227 --> 03:27.527
Does that sound like
it's gonna be enough?

03:27.582 --> 03:28.687
This is so mine.

03:28.712 --> 03:30.917
No, Hotchner, I'm taking
this. Don't do it.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.603
Yeah, I'm gonna
have to beat you.

03:32.671 --> 03:34.821
No!
I don't think it's gonna be enough.

03:34.873 --> 03:35.956
Oh, no!
No!

03:36.007 --> 03:37.157
Oh, no!

03:37.208 --> 03:38.158
That's not fair!

03:38.209 --> 03:39.510
Ow! Ohh! Ohh!

03:39.594 --> 03:41.562
You all right?

03:41.630 --> 03:43.230
Ohh...

03:43.298 --> 03:45.266
Yes. Yeah. I think...
Cramp?

03:45.333 --> 03:46.400
You sure--
I think I'm gonna beat you.

03:46.468 --> 03:47.568
Yeah! Ha ha!

03:47.636 --> 03:49.687
That's really pathetic.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.221
Really?
I win.

03:51.306 --> 03:52.940
You know, you don't win
if you cheat.

03:53.007 --> 03:55.359
Come on. You just
gotta learn to keep up.

03:55.443 --> 03:57.010
What happened to slow
and steady wins the race?

03:57.062 --> 03:58.479
Who taught you that?

03:59.564 --> 04:01.248
My training partner.

04:01.316 --> 04:02.700
She sounds brilliant.

04:02.784 --> 04:03.934
Oh, she is.

04:04.002 --> 04:06.820
She's very smart.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.541
Training's easier
with a partner.

04:10.625 --> 04:13.294
I've been meaning to remind you
to thank me for that.

04:13.361 --> 04:16.779
Uh-huh.
Our lunches are ok, too.

04:16.848 --> 04:18.464
Yes, they are.

04:18.533 --> 04:20.216
So, I was reading that
you shouldn't train

04:20.242 --> 04:21.201
the week before the race.

04:21.202 --> 04:23.420
So, this might be it.

04:23.505 --> 04:25.322
What are we gonna do
about that?

04:25.390 --> 04:28.642
Well, I think we should
do something.

04:31.930 --> 04:35.599
Aaron Hotchner, are you
asking me out on a date?

04:35.684 --> 04:37.401
I'm trying.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.069
It's not going very well.

04:39.154 --> 04:41.605
Accepted and eagerly
anticipated.

04:41.690 --> 04:43.490
When shall I expect
my chariot?

04:43.558 --> 04:44.558
Friday?

04:44.609 --> 04:45.809
Yeah.

04:50.031 --> 04:51.898
Morning.

04:57.905 --> 04:59.506
What?

04:59.574 --> 05:01.425
You work out this morning?

05:01.509 --> 05:04.094
I did.

05:04.162 --> 05:06.913
And how was the, uh,
workout?

05:06.965 --> 05:08.632
It's called training,
and it was fine.

05:08.717 --> 05:09.750
Right.

05:09.784 --> 05:11.885
Training.

05:11.936 --> 05:13.337
For what, though?

05:13.405 --> 05:14.605
Just stop.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.007
You know, race day's
almost here.

05:17.075 --> 05:19.259
You'll need a new excuse
to see her.

05:19.310 --> 05:22.012
It's been handled.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.164
Attaboy.

05:24.232 --> 05:25.182
When?

05:25.250 --> 05:27.534
Friday.

05:29.103 --> 05:31.038
Come hell or high water,
Aaron,

05:31.105 --> 05:34.141
I will get us back by Friday.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.877
So, last night,
3 unidentified males

05:36.944 --> 05:38.629
were found
in a lifeguard tower

05:38.696 --> 05:40.297
in Los Angeles' South Bay.

05:40.382 --> 05:43.217
Ages are estimated between
mid-20s and early 40s.

05:43.284 --> 05:45.469
Each died from a single gunshot
wound to the head.

05:45.553 --> 05:47.287
Yeah, and two of the bodies
were wrapped in plastic.

05:47.338 --> 05:49.339
It could be practical.

05:50.842 --> 05:52.393
To keep blood
from spreading?

05:52.460 --> 05:54.311
Or symbolic. Covering
the bodies could be his way

05:54.396 --> 05:55.962
of showing remorse
for the kills.

05:56.014 --> 05:58.315
Yeah, why not wrap
the third body?

05:58.400 --> 05:59.733
Maybe the unsub
left him exposed

05:59.801 --> 06:01.518
specifically because
of who he represents.

06:01.603 --> 06:03.520
Well, identifying the bodies
should be our top priority.

06:03.605 --> 06:05.072
Yes. Which is why
I'm currently running prints

06:05.097 --> 06:06.156
and facial recognition.

06:06.157 --> 06:08.025
Hopefully we'll be done
by the time you guys land.

06:08.109 --> 06:10.194
The lifeguard tower is not due
to open for another month,

06:10.278 --> 06:11.695
and that's probably
not a coincidence.

06:11.780 --> 06:14.081
We should look at recently
released inmates in the area,

06:14.148 --> 06:15.949
make sure he didn't learn his
clean-up skills on the inside.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.501
Hey, guys,
there's something else.

06:17.585 --> 06:19.503
According to the M.E. report,
each of the victims

06:19.587 --> 06:20.871
was missing their genitals.

06:20.955 --> 06:23.841
He could be trying to hide
evidence of sexual assault.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.560
Maybe. Jeffrey Dahmer
used to keep his victims'

06:26.628 --> 06:28.411
sex organs on display.

06:28.436 --> 06:30.296
What if this unsub
is doing the same thing?

07:23.910 --> 07:26.661
"For trust not him
that hath once broken faith."

07:27.670 --> 07:30.388
William Shakespeare.

07:30.473 --> 07:32.057
He's castrating
the victims postmortem,

07:32.141 --> 07:34.159
so torture isn't his game.

07:34.226 --> 07:35.810
A shot to the head
is efficient.

07:35.878 --> 07:37.145
I don't think he wants
his victims to suffer.

07:37.213 --> 07:38.596
And a quick kill
is impersonal.

07:38.681 --> 07:40.932
And it lacks the thrill on which
a lot of unsubs thrive.

07:41.017 --> 07:42.834
Yet the castration
is very personal.

07:42.902 --> 07:44.002
He probably knew his victims.

07:44.070 --> 07:45.270
Or he could be impotent.

07:45.354 --> 07:46.771
The unsub feels emasculated,

07:46.856 --> 07:48.340
so he wants his victims
to feel the same way.

07:48.407 --> 07:50.108
You know, the scorecard
killer, Randy Craft,

07:50.192 --> 07:53.078
mutilated his victims in a similar,
yet more severe fashion.

07:53.162 --> 07:55.252
That was to hide the fact
that he targeted

07:55.277 --> 07:56.677
hitchhikers and gay men.

07:56.716 --> 07:57.949
Kraft also
raped his victims

07:58.034 --> 07:59.417
before dumping them
on the side of the road.

07:59.485 --> 08:01.569
Ding dong. I have I.D.'d
all the dead people.

08:01.620 --> 08:03.371
The information is there
at your tablets.

08:03.422 --> 08:05.540
It turns out each of those 3 men
was in town on business.

08:05.591 --> 08:06.858
None of them lived there.

08:06.926 --> 08:09.794
So he crosses age, race,
and socioeconomic backgrounds.

08:09.879 --> 08:11.196
No physical similarities
either.

08:11.263 --> 08:13.048
It says here that one of the victims,
Sean Taylor,

08:13.099 --> 08:15.517
was in a domestic
partnership. He's gay.

08:15.584 --> 08:17.852
But Hank Mitchell
has a female spouse.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.938
That doesn't necessarily
preclude homosexual desire.

08:20.022 --> 08:22.173
Which victim was left exposed?

08:22.241 --> 08:23.424
Sean Taylor.

08:23.476 --> 08:25.426
So, like Craft, he could be
targeting victims

08:25.478 --> 08:27.028
based on
sexual orientation.

08:50.119 --> 08:52.270
Hey, guys, I'll be right back.

08:55.257 --> 08:56.524
What are you doing here?

08:56.592 --> 08:57.726
I had to see you.

08:57.793 --> 09:00.345
I'm at school.
You can't just be here.

09:00.429 --> 09:02.013
I know. It's crazy.
I...

09:02.098 --> 09:04.649
I had a really rough
night last night,

09:04.734 --> 09:05.967
and I thought
if I could see you,

09:06.018 --> 09:07.552
then maybe the day would
be a little better.

09:07.620 --> 09:09.070
You could have called first.

09:09.138 --> 09:10.572
If someone sees you,
I could get in trouble.

09:10.639 --> 09:12.240
Ok. Ok.

09:12.308 --> 09:13.858
I'll go.

09:13.943 --> 09:15.476
When can I see you next?

09:17.813 --> 09:19.664
I have a game tomorrow night.

09:19.749 --> 09:22.117
Pick me up after.
I'll come over to your place.

09:22.168 --> 09:23.118
I can't spend the night,
though.

09:23.169 --> 09:24.953
Fine. Whatever.

09:25.004 --> 09:27.338
It's all good.

09:27.423 --> 09:28.923
Go. Cool.

09:31.677 --> 09:33.011
Let's go.

09:37.299 --> 09:38.600
Quinn Parker, S.A.C.

09:38.667 --> 09:40.635
Agent Hotchner.
This is Agent Prentiss.

09:40.686 --> 09:42.103
Where would you like
for us to set up?

09:42.171 --> 09:44.222
This way. Another body
was discovered this morning,

09:44.306 --> 09:46.891
hidden in a lifeguard
tower in Manhattan Beach.

09:46.976 --> 09:48.059
He changed the dump site,

09:48.144 --> 09:49.611
now that the other one's
been discovered.

09:49.678 --> 09:52.030
We've been sweeping all the
towers since the first discovery.

09:52.114 --> 09:54.649
This body was dumped
sometime between 4:00 and 6 a.m.

09:54.700 --> 09:56.951
Increase the patrols
to every hour, but vary the search.

09:57.019 --> 10:00.121
It's likely he's following the
investigation and he's adapting.

10:00.189 --> 10:01.973
This body was left exposed
like Sean Taylor's.

10:02.041 --> 10:03.475
Joseph Kraus.

10:03.542 --> 10:06.995
42, San Fernando Valley
native, works downtown.

10:07.046 --> 10:08.580
Not sure what he was doing
in the South Bay.

10:08.664 --> 10:09.898
Have the families arrived?

10:09.965 --> 10:11.166
Yeah. Kraus's wife
just got here.

10:11.217 --> 10:12.634
The others
are flying in.

10:12.701 --> 10:14.135
I'll speak to Mrs. Kraus,
and I'll reroute

10:14.203 --> 10:15.536
Morgan and Rossi
to the new dump site.

10:15.588 --> 10:16.688
I'll talk to the families.

10:23.378 --> 10:25.313
Mrs. Kraus, I'm Agent Hotchner.

10:25.380 --> 10:26.431
Oh.

10:26.515 --> 10:28.149
I'm very sorry
for your loss.

10:28.217 --> 10:30.235
It's just so hard
to believe he's gone.

10:30.319 --> 10:33.238
Had Joseph given
any indication

10:33.322 --> 10:35.657
as to where he was going
when he disappeared?

10:35.724 --> 10:39.327
Oh, Joe, please. Only his mother
called him Joseph.

10:39.394 --> 10:40.495
Oh.

10:40.562 --> 10:43.448
No, he just said
he needed some fresh air.

10:43.532 --> 10:45.316
I didn't question it.

10:45.384 --> 10:47.135
He was found
in Manhattan Beach.

10:47.203 --> 10:49.204
Does that mean
anything to you?

10:49.255 --> 10:51.289
We went to lMU
for college.

10:51.373 --> 10:54.509
In freshman year
his dad died.

10:54.576 --> 10:56.647
And he used to go
to the beach at night

10:56.672 --> 10:57.872
to collect his thoughts.

10:57.913 --> 11:01.299
Was there anything in particular
that prompted his departure?

11:01.383 --> 11:03.935
Uh, he lost his job.

11:04.019 --> 11:05.303
And was worried
about finances?

11:05.387 --> 11:08.273
We both were.

11:19.201 --> 11:20.985
There's no lights
anywhere, Rossi.

11:21.070 --> 11:22.704
He could easily dump a body
without being seen.

11:22.771 --> 11:24.656
The unsub dragged him
up the ramp.

11:24.740 --> 11:27.625
He wasn't in plastic
when he was brought here.

11:27.710 --> 11:29.694
So that's two bodies wrapped
and two bodies left exposed.

11:29.762 --> 11:31.045
Why is the unsub
differentiating?

11:31.113 --> 11:32.113
The rest of the M.O.
is the same.

11:32.164 --> 11:35.049
GSW to the head,
severed genitals.

11:35.117 --> 11:37.618
But why did he leave
this guy unwrapped

11:37.670 --> 11:38.720
like Taylor?

11:40.723 --> 11:42.640
Hey, baby girl, tell me
you got something good.

11:42.725 --> 11:44.542
Hey, the M.E. report came back,

11:44.610 --> 11:47.028
and none of the victims
were sexually assaulted,

11:47.096 --> 11:50.481
aside from that unfortunate
appendage removal thing.

11:50.566 --> 11:51.983
Any luck
on the paper trails?

11:52.067 --> 11:54.369
Sean Taylor
used his credit card

11:54.436 --> 11:56.154
at a gym near
the convention center.

11:56.238 --> 11:58.189
JJ and Reid are
on their way there now.

11:58.274 --> 12:00.024
See if you can hack
their cell phones, too.

12:00.109 --> 12:02.377
Maybe they were meeting up with
someone the night they disappeared.

12:02.444 --> 12:04.345
Yes, I know you like me
one step ahead,

12:04.413 --> 12:06.647
so, there were no calls
near time of disappearance,

12:06.699 --> 12:08.649
and the rest is gonna take
a little longer to crack.

12:08.701 --> 12:09.784
Thank you, crazy.

12:09.835 --> 12:12.921
Anytime. Fantasy Fatale
bids you good day.

12:15.708 --> 12:19.660
Rossi, he discarded Joseph
like he was trash.

12:19.712 --> 12:21.763
But there's no indication
in the victimology

12:21.830 --> 12:24.966
to suggest that he
should be viewed that way.

12:25.017 --> 12:27.685
Maybe the unsub
hits on his victims,

12:27.770 --> 12:30.555
and this is what happens
when someone rejects him.

12:30.639 --> 12:32.440
If that's the case, they why
target straight men at all?

12:32.508 --> 12:34.776
Maybe rejection's
his hot button.

12:38.197 --> 12:39.480
Did you get anything?

12:39.531 --> 12:41.399
Joe Kraus lost his job
the day he went missing.

12:41.483 --> 12:43.401
That fits.
I've got one victim

12:43.485 --> 12:45.403
that just defaulted
on a mortgage,

12:45.487 --> 12:47.238
another victim
who served divorce papers

12:47.323 --> 12:48.923
the day before
flying to Los Angeles.

12:48.991 --> 12:51.342
They've each suffered a loss.
The unsub probably has, too.

12:51.410 --> 12:52.860
All right, so what am I
looking for?

12:52.911 --> 12:56.931
A sexually ambiguous male
of indiscriminate ethnicity

12:56.999 --> 13:00.101
who may or may not have lost
a job, wife, or loved one?

13:00.169 --> 13:01.669
No. There's only one
gay victim,

13:01.720 --> 13:04.472
so you are most likely
looking for a heterosexual male,

13:04.539 --> 13:07.292
who somehow learned all of
those things about his victims

13:07.359 --> 13:08.559
in a very short time.

13:08.644 --> 13:09.761
Someone who knows
the South Bay

13:09.845 --> 13:11.262
and targets men
unfamiliar with the area

13:11.347 --> 13:12.647
who won't be quickly missed.

13:12.714 --> 13:15.566
This means he's sociable,
but he doesn't stick out.

13:15.651 --> 13:17.218
And these are probably
not his first kills.

13:17.269 --> 13:18.736
If this concept
of shared losses

13:18.821 --> 13:20.822
is what's connecting
the unsub and the victims.

13:20.889 --> 13:22.907
How and where
is it happening?

13:32.701 --> 13:35.620
That's good. Gotta keep
your heart rate up.

13:35.704 --> 13:37.488
Hi.

13:37.556 --> 13:39.740
How can I help you today?

13:39.792 --> 13:42.076
Agent Jareau of the FBI.

13:42.127 --> 13:43.745
Ma'am.

13:43.812 --> 13:45.179
I called about
taking a look

13:45.247 --> 13:47.298
at your surveillance
footage from last week.

13:47.383 --> 13:50.268
Right. This way.

13:50.352 --> 13:53.064
Is it common for traveling
business professionals

13:53.089 --> 13:54.389
to use your facility?

13:54.423 --> 13:55.973
It's our specialty,
actually.

13:56.058 --> 13:58.192
We get a lot of out-of-towners
because of the convention center.

13:58.260 --> 14:00.895
Business really picked up when
we added the pay-by-day rate.

14:00.946 --> 14:02.730
Wouldn't hotels
have gyms of their own?

14:02.781 --> 14:05.717
Some do. We have contracts
with the ones that don't.

14:05.784 --> 14:08.820
Ok. 7 p.m. last Thursday,
like you asked.

14:08.904 --> 14:10.955
That's him.
That's Sean Taylor.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.773
Can you show me
where he goes next?

14:12.825 --> 14:14.442
Hotch just informed me
that each of the victims

14:14.493 --> 14:16.711
suffered a loss
prior to disappearance.

14:16.778 --> 14:18.496
Well, what was Taylor's loss?

14:18.580 --> 14:21.265
Stock market troubles resulted in
him losing his summer home.

14:22.918 --> 14:25.303
Hey, Spence, look at this.

14:25.387 --> 14:27.455
He's moving faster
than he's capable of.

14:27.506 --> 14:29.674
We see this all the time,
people frustrated with work

14:29.758 --> 14:32.643
coming in
just to blow off steam.

14:32.728 --> 14:35.629
He's punishing himself
in a self-destructive manner.

14:35.681 --> 14:37.482
This isn't someone
who's suffered a loss.

14:37.566 --> 14:39.300
This is someone who's
angry at the world.

14:39.351 --> 14:41.052
He was here nearly 3 hours.

14:41.120 --> 14:43.354
This is him
just before he left.

14:43.422 --> 14:45.306
This can't be about
just losing a summer home.

14:46.442 --> 14:48.359
We're gonna need
a copy of this.

14:48.444 --> 14:50.495
Thank you.
Ok.

14:50.579 --> 14:52.847
Hey, Garcia, I'm gonna
put you on speakerphone, ok?

14:52.915 --> 14:54.315
Hey yourself, 187.

14:54.366 --> 14:56.000
I have a new mystery
for you to solve.

14:56.085 --> 14:59.320
Your guy, Sean Taylor,
he rented a blue Charger

14:59.345 --> 14:59.871
while he was in town.

14:59.872 --> 15:01.322
Where's the car now?

15:01.373 --> 15:02.573
That is the mystery.

15:02.641 --> 15:05.009
Local P.D. can't find it,
and the rental service

15:05.094 --> 15:07.595
activated the LoJack system.
It's been deactivated.

15:07.662 --> 15:09.414
How skilled would
our unsub need to be

15:09.481 --> 15:11.015
in order to deactivate
the GPS?

15:11.100 --> 15:13.351
A novice would not
be good at that.

15:13.435 --> 15:16.187
But the mechanical elite,
they could do it without a hitch.

15:16.271 --> 15:18.256
Did any of the other victims
have cars in the city?

15:18.323 --> 15:20.274
Uh...Just one.

15:20.342 --> 15:21.943
Joseph Kraus.

15:22.010 --> 15:23.611
Hey, his car's missing, too.

15:23.678 --> 15:25.613
All right, Garcia, start pulling
auto workers in the area

15:25.680 --> 15:28.032
and cross it with prior offenses,
no matter how small.

15:28.117 --> 15:29.617
This unsub's going to great
lengths to cover his tracks,

15:29.684 --> 15:31.135
so he's gotta be
in the system somewhere.

15:31.203 --> 15:33.621
Copy that. Here I go.

15:33.688 --> 15:35.990
How's he hiding their cars?

15:52.040 --> 15:53.424
Doug.

15:54.709 --> 15:56.310
Working kind of late,
aren't you?

15:56.378 --> 15:59.630
Security company called to see
if your code was still good.

15:59.698 --> 16:01.766
What are you doing
here, Mike?

16:01.850 --> 16:03.284
I don't know.

16:03.352 --> 16:05.937
I thought maybe
we could talk.

16:06.021 --> 16:07.955
So, pick up the phone.

16:08.023 --> 16:09.640
I wasn't sure
you'd answer.

16:09.708 --> 16:12.710
You're the one that
doesn't return calls.

16:19.868 --> 16:23.087
Listen, I miss
my best friend.

16:23.172 --> 16:24.288
Friends?

16:24.373 --> 16:26.424
Fr-friends. Yeah.

16:26.508 --> 16:30.261
At this point, I doubt
we ever were.

16:30.345 --> 16:32.930
I'm sorry about what happened.
I never meant to--

16:33.015 --> 16:34.265
Never meant to what?

16:34.349 --> 16:36.350
To ruin my life?

16:36.418 --> 16:37.768
No, man. I just
want to fix it.

16:37.853 --> 16:39.136
You want to fix it.

16:39.221 --> 16:40.771
What are you gonna do,
put a band-aid on it?

16:40.856 --> 16:43.174
No, there's some things
that just can't be fixed.

16:45.594 --> 16:47.612
This was a mistake.

16:47.696 --> 16:49.197
I gotta go.

16:50.265 --> 16:52.750
Listen, I'm really sorry, Mike!

16:54.536 --> 16:57.288
Hey, isn't there anything
I can do?

16:57.372 --> 16:59.790
Anything to make it up to you?

16:59.875 --> 17:02.126
Sure.

17:02.211 --> 17:04.345
You could kill yourself.

17:11.303 --> 17:14.255
The murders started
nearly two months ago,

17:14.306 --> 17:15.756
but the time
in between kills

17:15.807 --> 17:17.925
has accelerated
over the past week.

17:17.976 --> 17:18.925
Why?

17:18.977 --> 17:20.428
Well, if the unsub
suffered a loss,

17:20.479 --> 17:23.431
we could be looking for someone
who was fired back then

17:23.482 --> 17:24.964
and struggling
to pay his bills now.

17:25.017 --> 17:26.851
Or divorcees currently
undergoing custody hearings.

17:26.935 --> 17:29.470
He's most likely operating
in one of the coastal cities.

17:29.521 --> 17:31.439
The victims were all staying
in the metropolitan area,

17:31.490 --> 17:33.441
but their bodies were
found near the ocean.

17:33.492 --> 17:35.610
Do you know how big
the California coastline is?

17:35.661 --> 17:38.195
840 miles. Fortunately, based
on the unsub's comfort zone,

17:38.280 --> 17:40.865
we can narrow down the area between
Santa Monica and Redondo Beach,

17:40.949 --> 17:44.235
and the paper trail shows each of
the victims in the downtown area

17:44.303 --> 17:46.254
until about 9 p.m.
the night they disappeared.

17:46.321 --> 17:47.872
After that
they go off grid.

17:47.956 --> 17:49.957
So how are the victims
ending up in the South Bay?

17:50.008 --> 17:52.343
Well, we haven't found
any of the missing cars.

17:52.427 --> 17:54.629
We know he's probably
nonthreatening.

17:54.680 --> 17:57.831
What if he asks for a lift
and then kills them en route?

17:57.883 --> 18:01.018
But how does he know that his
victims fit his emotional criteria?

18:01.103 --> 18:03.000
There's no common
denominator outside the loss

18:03.025 --> 18:04.225
that each has suffered.

18:04.439 --> 18:05.856
Sean Taylor did look
pretty distraught

18:05.941 --> 18:07.224
before storming out
of the gym.

18:07.292 --> 18:08.559
Elaine Kraus
said that her husband

18:08.644 --> 18:10.244
would often go to the
beach to clear his head.

18:10.312 --> 18:12.863
What if they're all
doing that?

18:12.948 --> 18:16.567
Maybe he's not taking them
to the beach.

18:16.652 --> 18:19.704
Maybe he's hunting them there.

18:19.788 --> 18:22.039
I mean, it gets to the point

18:22.124 --> 18:24.241
where you can't even look at
yourself in the mirror.

18:24.326 --> 18:26.077
You think it's your fault.

18:26.161 --> 18:28.129
Sometimes you have to
move on,

18:28.196 --> 18:30.131
but sometimes
you can't move on.

18:30.198 --> 18:32.083
And that's no way to live.

18:32.167 --> 18:34.919
Of course there's
always the easy way out.

18:36.171 --> 18:37.755
But who wants to take that?

18:37.839 --> 18:40.925
You got responsibilities.

18:41.009 --> 18:44.762
What I'm trying to say, Gus...

18:44.846 --> 18:47.231
Is I understand.

18:47.316 --> 18:48.899
I do.

18:48.984 --> 18:50.935
And you no longer
have to suffer.

18:51.019 --> 18:52.052
Please let me go!

18:52.104 --> 18:54.488
I won't ignore your pain.

18:54.556 --> 18:56.724
Oh, no, I'm not in pain,
I promise. I feel better now.

18:56.775 --> 18:58.943
Ha ha! See?
You know how many times

18:59.027 --> 19:00.411
I said
that exact same thing?

19:00.495 --> 19:01.412
It's the truth!

19:01.496 --> 19:03.314
No. This is the truth.

19:03.382 --> 19:07.084
No! Someone help me, please!

19:07.169 --> 19:08.836
No one can hear you.

19:20.588 --> 19:23.040
The vic's name
was Gus Harrington.

19:23.091 --> 19:24.792
Found him underneath
the pier in Santa Monica.

19:24.859 --> 19:27.144
He changed his method of
disposal to avoid detection,

19:27.211 --> 19:29.029
but he's staying near the beach
because he's compelled to.

19:29.097 --> 19:30.547
It means something
to him.

19:30.598 --> 19:32.008
The credit card history
indicated Harrington

19:32.033 --> 19:33.233
was staying here.

19:38.823 --> 19:43.610
Looks like he was
drowning his sorrows.

19:44.913 --> 19:46.830
He emptied
the mini bar first.

19:46.898 --> 19:49.733
A man in this condition
couldn't have driven to the beach.

19:49.784 --> 19:51.952
Yeah, his car is still
in the hotel parking.

19:52.037 --> 19:54.038
So he was intoxicated
when he got dressed.

19:54.089 --> 19:56.607
A drunk target would be
easier to subdue.

19:56.675 --> 19:57.908
So where would he go next?

19:57.959 --> 20:01.712
He ran out of booze.
He probably went to find more.

20:04.349 --> 20:06.917
We believe we're looking
for a white male in his 30s or 40s

20:06.968 --> 20:08.718
who's targeting
emotionally distraught men.

20:08.719 --> 20:10.472
Cell phone records show
none of the victims

20:10.497 --> 20:11.997
made calls or had appointments

20:12.025 --> 20:13.416
the evenings they went missing.

20:13.417 --> 20:15.701
This unsub selects his target,
befriends him,

20:15.752 --> 20:17.253
and then kills him
all in one night.

20:17.337 --> 20:21.490
This means that he's ordinary,
unimposing, easy to talk to.

20:21.558 --> 20:24.093
Because he can get his victims
to open up and reveal

20:24.118 --> 20:26.959
personal information,
we believe he's able to somehow

20:26.961 --> 20:29.881
project a sense of familiarity
towards them.

20:30.801 --> 20:32.318
That familiarity
most likely

20:32.386 --> 20:34.586
comes in the form
of a shared loss.

20:34.638 --> 20:37.142
He's targeting down-and-out
businessmen struggling

20:37.167 --> 20:38.367
in their everyday life.

20:44.147 --> 20:47.283
He preys upon
their vulnerability

20:47.367 --> 20:49.618
and then kills his victims with
single shots to the head.

20:49.703 --> 20:51.537
He believes that
he's being merciful,

20:51.604 --> 20:53.272
putting them
out of their misery.

20:53.323 --> 20:55.441
Because he feels compelled
to remove his victims' genitals,

20:55.492 --> 20:58.210
we believe he feels
emasculated by his own loss.

21:05.919 --> 21:08.137
Most of the victims are from
out of town and new to the area,

21:08.221 --> 21:10.806
so we should look
at anyone trusted to offer advice

21:10.891 --> 21:12.391
to visiting professionals.

21:12.459 --> 21:14.894
The unsub most likely has a working
knowledge of auto mechanics,

21:14.961 --> 21:17.980
or at the very least, the resources
to disable the car's GPS system.

21:18.065 --> 21:20.733
What are you doing here?

21:20.800 --> 21:22.518
I need a reason now?

21:22.602 --> 21:23.736
I paid for this house.

21:23.803 --> 21:25.154
Why were you at Hunter's
school yesterday?

21:25.238 --> 21:27.590
- He told you?
- Of course he told me.

21:27.657 --> 21:29.241
I just wanted to see him.

21:29.309 --> 21:30.426
You know what the court said.

21:30.494 --> 21:32.244
Supervised visitation.

21:32.312 --> 21:33.245
I'm his father!

21:33.313 --> 21:36.198
Well, stalking
isn't parenting.

21:36.249 --> 21:39.985
Hunter's scared. He doesn't think
he knows his father anymore.

21:43.457 --> 21:44.607
Mike.

21:44.674 --> 21:46.926
Gee, I wonder why.

21:48.845 --> 21:50.763
We believe that
our unsub's comfort zone

21:50.830 --> 21:52.164
is in the South Bay
district,

21:52.215 --> 21:53.599
so we should start
our search there.

21:53.666 --> 21:54.934
But having said that,
it's important

21:55.001 --> 21:56.585
not to display too heavy
of a police presence.

21:56.653 --> 21:57.937
Why is that?

21:58.004 --> 21:59.939
He's gone to great lengths
to protect his identity.

22:00.006 --> 22:02.241
That's because
he has something to lose.

22:02.309 --> 22:04.276
If he feels that
we're closing in on him,

22:04.344 --> 22:07.029
it's likely he'll move to another
location and start killing there.

22:07.114 --> 22:08.314
Thank you.

22:11.284 --> 22:12.701
Go ahead, Garcia.

22:12.786 --> 22:14.203
The M.E. ran liver tests.

22:14.287 --> 22:16.372
All of the victims had
elevated levels of alcohol

22:16.456 --> 22:17.706
in their systems.

22:17.791 --> 22:19.525
We should narrow our search
to liquor stores and bars.

22:19.576 --> 22:21.043
The unsub could be hunting
his victims there.

22:21.128 --> 22:22.211
But wait, there's more.

22:22.295 --> 22:23.913
In my obsessive
cross-checking,

22:23.997 --> 22:26.048
I unearthed something,
and by something,

22:26.133 --> 22:27.583
I mean nothing.

22:27.651 --> 22:28.717
Explain.

22:28.802 --> 22:31.720
The trail runs frosty,
my friends.

22:31.805 --> 22:33.789
None of the victims
purchased alcohol

22:33.857 --> 22:34.957
on the night
they went missing.

22:35.025 --> 22:36.892
I'm clever. I even checked
ATM transactions

22:36.960 --> 22:38.227
to see if they used cash.

22:38.311 --> 22:40.896
Zilch. Zero dinero
spent on the sauce.

22:40.964 --> 22:42.531
So how
are they drinking?

22:42.599 --> 22:44.133
Good work, Garcia.

22:44.201 --> 22:47.419
The unsub couldn't have known
his victims more than a few hours.

22:47.487 --> 22:49.638
Is he just convincing total strangers
to let him buy their drinks?

22:49.706 --> 22:52.491
In my experience, people
don't question an open bar.

22:52.559 --> 22:54.743
They just give thanks
and order another round.

22:54.828 --> 22:56.445
You know, he could be
finding his targets on the streets

22:56.530 --> 22:58.747
and then inviting them
to his house for a private party.

22:58.865 --> 23:02.585
But how is he able to figure out
that they match his victimology?

23:02.669 --> 23:05.371
In order for him to do that,
he'd have to spend time with them,

23:05.422 --> 23:07.206
listen to their troubles.

23:07.257 --> 23:08.641
What are you thinking?

23:08.708 --> 23:11.377
Who can you pour
your problems to over drinks,

23:11.428 --> 23:13.429
even though you've
never met them before?

23:13.513 --> 23:16.265
The same person who can make sure
you don't run a tab or a paper trail.

23:21.438 --> 23:24.306
The kitchen's gonna be
closing up pretty soon.

23:24.391 --> 23:26.725
You want to put an order in
before the cook goes home?

23:26.776 --> 23:29.028
No. Peanuts are fine, thanks.

23:29.095 --> 23:32.398
Could use another one.

23:32.449 --> 23:33.766
Rough day?

23:33.834 --> 23:35.484
Yeah.

23:35.569 --> 23:37.903
Rough life.

23:40.373 --> 23:42.575
Want to talk about it?

23:42.626 --> 23:45.628
There are hundreds or bars
and clubs in the South Bay.

23:45.712 --> 23:48.447
Not including ones
in hotels and restaurants.

23:48.498 --> 23:51.667
I mean, how are we
supposed to narrow it down?

23:51.751 --> 23:54.038
It doesn't take into account
a lot of bartenders

23:54.063 --> 23:54.970
work multiple venues--

23:54.971 --> 23:56.672
private parties, events.

23:56.756 --> 23:59.341
We're looking for
a needle in a haystack.

23:59.426 --> 24:00.458
If the unsub's a bartender,
he probably hears

24:00.483 --> 24:01.683
sob stories all the time.

24:01.895 --> 24:04.296
The trigger's gotta be something
more specific than that.

24:04.347 --> 24:05.814
It can't just be
about loss, like you said?

24:05.899 --> 24:09.134
These losses aren't sufficient enough
to warrant mercy killings.

24:09.185 --> 24:11.820
Especially not by someone
who's heard it all before.

24:11.905 --> 24:15.241
Guys, what if the losses
aren't what's triggering the unsub?

24:15.308 --> 24:16.975
What if it's the catalyst
to the losses?

24:17.027 --> 24:19.028
A behavioral trait
each of the victims had

24:19.112 --> 24:21.347
that made them
vulnerable to loss.

24:21.414 --> 24:23.249
Or an event so overwhelming
it's consuming everything in their life.

24:23.316 --> 24:25.534
Loss of job, home,
family.

24:25.619 --> 24:27.836
What event could cause
each of those?

24:27.921 --> 24:30.239
What if it's the emotional
toll of a failed relationship?

24:30.307 --> 24:34.159
He's targeting victims
with broken hearts.

24:37.830 --> 24:39.848
Once the trust is broken,

24:39.933 --> 24:42.251
you never get it back.

24:42.319 --> 24:43.552
Not ever.

24:43.637 --> 24:45.220
I hear you, buddy.

24:45.305 --> 24:47.940
My best friend just moved in
with my wife.

24:48.007 --> 24:48.941
No.

24:49.008 --> 24:49.942
Yep.

24:50.009 --> 24:50.943
Women.

24:51.010 --> 24:52.778
Yeah. Can I get
you another one?

24:52.845 --> 24:54.513
As soon as I get back.

25:00.153 --> 25:03.405
What's, uh,
troubling you, Hon?

25:04.691 --> 25:08.210
Hope that, uh, women comment
didn't offend you.

25:08.295 --> 25:11.297
Not at all. My relationship
just ended, too.

25:11.364 --> 25:14.032
Wow, really? It must be
something in the air.

25:14.084 --> 25:16.468
He was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

25:16.536 --> 25:18.253
Yeah, well.

25:18.338 --> 25:20.756
You know, February
messes with people's heads.

25:20.840 --> 25:23.809
Here. A little more.

25:23.876 --> 25:25.711
The problem is,
it's all my fault.

25:25.762 --> 25:27.963
I'm sure that's not true.

25:28.031 --> 25:29.798
I was stupid,
and I was drunk.

25:29.866 --> 25:31.383
You know what people say?
They say,

25:31.434 --> 25:34.269
as long as you didn't cheat,
everything is forgivable.

25:37.107 --> 25:39.108
Nobody's perfect.

25:39.175 --> 25:41.327
Right?

25:41.394 --> 25:43.312
Barkeep.

25:43.380 --> 25:45.581
How's that new round coming?

25:45.665 --> 25:47.583
You know, buddy,
I think you've had enough.

25:47.667 --> 25:49.668
How about I, uh,
call you a cab?

25:55.125 --> 25:57.576
There you go, sweetheart.

25:59.629 --> 26:01.747
That's on the house.

26:29.329 --> 26:30.947
Killed a woman this time.

26:31.031 --> 26:32.281
Forensics match the blade?

26:32.366 --> 26:34.166
Body's been hacked
to pieces.

26:34.234 --> 26:35.451
Dumped her in the trash.

26:35.536 --> 26:37.169
Maybe this is the woman that
broke the unsub's heart.

26:37.237 --> 26:39.171
Name's kelsey Ashwood.

26:39.239 --> 26:41.591
She drove down from
Santa Barbara last night.

26:41.675 --> 26:42.959
Husband's on his way
to the field office.

26:43.043 --> 26:46.178
The unsub didn't shoot her
in the head like the others.

26:46.246 --> 26:48.531
He started cutting her up
while she was still alive.

26:48.599 --> 26:49.932
He didn't castrate her,
either.

26:50.017 --> 26:51.601
This is anger
on a whole other level.

26:51.685 --> 26:53.252
He took his time with her.

26:53.303 --> 26:54.937
If she wasn't
the target of his rage,

26:55.022 --> 26:56.856
she definitely
represents who is.

26:56.924 --> 26:59.025
Well, he's escalating.
It won't be long before

26:59.092 --> 27:01.928
he actually goes after the person
that he blames for his loss.

27:15.208 --> 27:16.275
Mike?

27:16.326 --> 27:17.276
What the hell?

27:17.327 --> 27:18.611
I mean, you don't
work here anymore.

27:18.662 --> 27:19.795
You remember that, right?

27:19.880 --> 27:21.297
Some business
I needed to deal with.

27:21.381 --> 27:24.517
Look, you can't be
coming around like this.

27:24.585 --> 27:27.336
Andrea told me you showed up
at Hunter's school.

27:27.404 --> 27:28.638
That's none of your business.

27:28.705 --> 27:30.973
Well, it is my business
because this is my business.

27:31.041 --> 27:33.142
Hey, what are you doing here?

27:33.210 --> 27:34.777
Whose car is that?

27:34.845 --> 27:36.646
A friend of mine.
Didn't think you'd mind.

27:36.730 --> 27:39.015
Hell, did you steal a car?

27:41.935 --> 27:43.969
Is that why you've been
coming around here?

27:44.021 --> 27:45.655
I don't steal things,
Doug.

27:45.739 --> 27:46.822
You do.

27:46.907 --> 27:48.391
I didn't steal anything.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.693
Ok. You gonna be
giving them back, then?

27:50.777 --> 27:54.480
Hey, look. I know the divorce
has been hard on you.

27:54.531 --> 27:56.815
But you need to get past it.

27:56.867 --> 27:59.385
For everyone's sake.

27:59.453 --> 28:00.753
Just do the right thing.

28:00.820 --> 28:03.272
Do the right thing?

28:03.340 --> 28:04.290
Yes.

28:04.341 --> 28:05.675
Do the right thing?!

28:05.759 --> 28:08.444
Coming from the guy
who broke up my marriage,

28:08.512 --> 28:10.546
took away my kid?!

28:10.631 --> 28:12.048
Do the right thing.

28:12.132 --> 28:13.683
You dirty--

28:13.767 --> 28:15.284
Aah! No!

28:15.352 --> 28:17.637
Oh, Mike...

28:17.688 --> 28:21.223
Ohh...Mike.

28:21.308 --> 28:23.726
I think
you broke my back.

28:31.318 --> 28:34.787
Mike...

28:38.458 --> 28:41.427
Mike, what are you doing?

28:41.495 --> 28:43.396
Turn off the machine.

28:43.463 --> 28:44.914
Mike...

28:44.998 --> 28:47.333
Get--I'm not--

28:47.384 --> 28:48.634
for God's sake...

28:48.702 --> 28:51.704
Turn the damn thing off!

28:54.224 --> 28:56.926
Mike! Mike!

28:57.010 --> 29:00.062
What--I'm sorry, Mike.

29:00.147 --> 29:01.731
Ok? I didn't know.
I didn't know!

29:01.815 --> 29:04.133
I found out about Hunter
the same time you did, Mike!

29:04.201 --> 29:06.552
Mike, please!
Help me, Mike!

29:06.603 --> 29:08.754
Mike, help me!
Mike! Mike!

29:08.822 --> 29:10.806
Mike, don't!

29:10.874 --> 29:13.109
No! Aah!

29:26.707 --> 29:28.541
Take your time.

29:30.844 --> 29:34.980
Why would someone
do this to her?

29:35.048 --> 29:36.665
That's what we're
trying to find out.

29:36.733 --> 29:39.635
I just want to hold her
in my arms one more time.

29:42.589 --> 29:44.206
The last thing we did
was fight.

29:44.274 --> 29:46.225
What was the fight about?

29:50.397 --> 29:52.698
Look, it's important
that you be honest.

29:52.766 --> 29:55.601
It could help us find the man
that did this to her.

29:57.370 --> 29:59.455
She slept with someone else.

29:59.539 --> 30:02.675
She said it was just
a one-time thing, but I--

30:02.743 --> 30:04.310
I just couldn't get past it.

30:04.377 --> 30:06.629
Not many people can.

30:08.799 --> 30:11.751
I loved her so much.

30:14.087 --> 30:16.472
But I couldn't fix us.

30:19.926 --> 30:21.977
We were right.
All of the unsub's victims

30:22.062 --> 30:24.180
recently suffered the end
of a romantic relationship,

30:24.264 --> 30:26.532
but they actually have
something else in common.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.651
Each of the relationships
ended due to infidelity?

30:28.735 --> 30:30.069
How do you know that?

30:30.136 --> 30:32.154
Kelsey Ashwood
cheated on her husband.

30:32.222 --> 30:34.523
All 5 of the male victims
were businessman

30:34.608 --> 30:36.442
devastated by the destruction
of the relationships.

30:36.493 --> 30:38.110
They probably started
acting out,

30:38.161 --> 30:39.662
which led to the losses
we profiled earlier.

30:39.746 --> 30:42.031
Well, get this. Sean Taylor
and Joe Kraus were the ones

30:42.115 --> 30:43.699
that cheated
in their relationships.

30:43.767 --> 30:46.268
They were the ones
who were left exposed.

30:46.336 --> 30:48.087
So he's showing sympathy to
the men that were cheated on,

30:48.154 --> 30:49.605
yet anger toward the cheaters.

30:51.958 --> 30:53.092
This is Dr. Reid.

30:54.294 --> 30:55.845
All right, thanks.

30:55.929 --> 30:58.264
Kelsey's car was found
in a junkyard near Torrance.

30:58.331 --> 31:01.066
Somebody was in the compactor
when it was crushed.

31:09.442 --> 31:11.026
The victim
is Doug Summers,

31:11.111 --> 31:12.695
owner of
the wrecking yard.

31:12.779 --> 31:14.697
The car was on top of him
when it was crushed.

31:14.764 --> 31:17.015
Maybe he stumbled
on the unsub in action.

31:17.067 --> 31:18.684
This wasn't planned out
like the others.

31:18.735 --> 31:19.852
This was impulsive.

31:19.903 --> 31:21.153
His entire M.O.
has changed.

31:21.204 --> 31:22.972
He wanted Doug
to suffer.

31:23.039 --> 31:24.849
Garcia, I need you
to run background details

31:24.874 --> 31:26.041
on Doug Summers.

31:26.042 --> 31:28.127
He runs the LB
Wrecking Yard in Torrance.

31:28.194 --> 31:29.378
Checking.

31:29.462 --> 31:31.130
Uh, it seems
clean as a whistle.

31:31.197 --> 31:33.582
Hold on. His name's listed
in a legal docket.

31:33.667 --> 31:37.753
Mr. Summers is currently
testifying in a custody battle

31:37.838 --> 31:40.222
between Michael Janeczko
and Andrea Wright.

31:40.307 --> 31:42.541
Janeczko used to work
at the wrecking yard,

31:42.592 --> 31:46.128
and Wright is Mr. Summers'
new fiancee.

31:46.196 --> 31:48.514
She filed for divorce
two months ago.

31:48.565 --> 31:49.598
That's right when
the killings started.

31:49.683 --> 31:50.733
Where's Janeczko?

31:50.817 --> 31:51.884
Last known address

31:51.935 --> 31:53.903
was the house he shared
with his former wife.

31:59.910 --> 32:01.727
I don't understand. What does
the FBI want with Michael?

32:01.778 --> 32:03.746
We need to find him
as soon as possible.

32:03.830 --> 32:04.947
Do you know where
he's been staying?

32:05.015 --> 32:06.949
He runs a bar on 2nd.

32:07.033 --> 32:08.157
The owner's back east,
so he's been sleeping

32:08.182 --> 32:09.382
in the loft above it.

32:09.903 --> 32:11.203
Please, what did he do?

32:11.254 --> 32:13.856
He's a suspect in
a murder investigation.

32:13.924 --> 32:16.041
Mike? That's ridiculous.

32:16.092 --> 32:18.544
We think he's been going
through an emotional break.

32:20.580 --> 32:22.498
He's been through a lot.

32:22.566 --> 32:24.583
I'm afraid
there's more.

32:24.634 --> 32:27.336
Ma'am, Doug Summers
was killed

32:27.404 --> 32:28.687
earlier this morning.

32:28.755 --> 32:31.023
What?

32:31.090 --> 32:32.174
What did you say?

32:32.242 --> 32:33.492
I'm so sorry.

32:35.261 --> 32:38.247
No.

32:39.265 --> 32:41.934
Not after
all we've been through.

32:42.002 --> 32:43.369
What have you been through?

32:45.255 --> 32:47.206
You've documented
Hunter's life with Michael

32:47.273 --> 32:49.475
and Hunter's life
with Doug equally.

32:49.542 --> 32:50.709
Why?

32:53.663 --> 32:55.331
Is Michael
not Hunter's father?

32:56.383 --> 32:57.499
Do they know the truth?

33:00.787 --> 33:03.305
Yes.

33:03.390 --> 33:05.307
When did they find out?

33:05.392 --> 33:07.910
Two months ago.

33:07.978 --> 33:09.695
Do you know
where Hunter is now?

33:16.886 --> 33:17.820
Hunter.

33:17.904 --> 33:18.821
Go ahead.
I'll catch up.

33:18.905 --> 33:21.657
We gotta go, now.
What the hell?

33:21.741 --> 33:23.692
What are you doing here?
Mom said you're not allowed to come--

33:23.777 --> 33:24.802
I don't give a damn
what your mother has to say.

33:24.827 --> 33:25.828
Get in the car!

33:25.829 --> 33:26.912
I'm at school.
I can't just leave.

33:26.980 --> 33:28.163
I am your father, right?

33:28.248 --> 33:30.416
If I say you can leave,
then you can leave.

33:30.483 --> 33:32.267
Now...

33:32.335 --> 33:33.752
Get in, get in, get in.

33:52.154 --> 33:54.839
Tell me what's going on.

33:54.906 --> 33:57.541
Yeah. We gotta
get out of town.

33:57.609 --> 33:59.960
I'm not going anywhere!
You're acting crazy.

34:00.045 --> 34:00.565
Look, I know things
have been a little off

34:00.590 --> 34:02.417
between you and me lately,
all right? But...

34:05.083 --> 34:06.419
Everything is gonna be fine.

34:06.420 --> 34:09.589
You are my son.
I am your father.

34:09.674 --> 34:11.174
That is that.

34:14.061 --> 34:16.545
I'm calling mom.

34:16.597 --> 34:17.897
No, you are not!

34:17.982 --> 34:20.400
She is not part of our life anymore.
Do you understand me?

34:20.484 --> 34:23.969
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to yell. I didn't.

34:24.038 --> 34:26.072
What did you do?
Is mom ok?

34:26.157 --> 34:30.327
She's fine.
Your mother is fine.

34:33.080 --> 34:34.237
I need to tell Doug
where we're going

34:34.263 --> 34:35.614
so mom doesn't freak out.

34:39.954 --> 34:41.538
Wait...

34:41.589 --> 34:42.739
Wait...

34:44.091 --> 34:45.592
Dougie is dead.

34:46.710 --> 34:47.793
What?

34:47.878 --> 34:50.045
What did you do?!

34:50.097 --> 34:53.516
I didn't mean to! I know
how much he means to you!

34:53.583 --> 34:55.518
I love you so much, son.

34:57.938 --> 35:00.373
He just made me so mad.

35:00.441 --> 35:02.776
Uhh! Uhh!

35:02.860 --> 35:05.261
You killed my father!

35:11.485 --> 35:13.370
I am your father.

35:22.413 --> 35:24.156
According to the ex-wife,
Michael's been staying

35:24.181 --> 35:25.381
in the loft above the bar.

35:25.750 --> 35:27.500
We got two floors to cover.

35:27.585 --> 35:28.968
Have your people maintain
a perimeter around the building.

35:29.053 --> 35:30.620
Shouldn't we wait for S.W.A.T.?

35:30.671 --> 35:32.639
We're out of time. Hunter knows
Michael's not his real father.

35:32.723 --> 35:34.007
If he rejects him,
Michael could lash out

35:34.091 --> 35:35.458
at whoever's closest,
including Hunter.

35:35.509 --> 35:36.693
All right, let's move.

36:06.757 --> 36:07.907
Daddy.

36:07.975 --> 36:09.426
You don't love me.

36:10.628 --> 36:14.397
FBI. Michael Janeczko,
put the gun down.

36:15.616 --> 36:18.084
He told me
I wasn't his father.

36:18.152 --> 36:24.524
I'm sure you didn't
mean that. Right, Hunter?

36:24.608 --> 36:26.276
You were frustrated.

36:26.343 --> 36:29.946
I--I was hurt because
of what happened to Doug.

36:30.013 --> 36:32.732
That wasn't your fault,
huh, Michael?

36:32.817 --> 36:35.118
It was an accident.

36:35.185 --> 36:38.071
I would never hurt my son.

36:38.155 --> 36:39.989
Tell him how you feel.

36:41.067 --> 36:42.487
He raised you.

36:42.512 --> 36:44.781
No matter what, he'll
always be your real dad.

36:46.964 --> 36:49.215
Sure. You were always
there for me.

36:50.968 --> 36:52.268
You're my dad.

36:52.336 --> 36:54.070
Put your weapon down.

36:54.138 --> 36:55.421
You put yours down! Do it!

36:55.506 --> 36:58.541
Ok.

36:58.592 --> 37:00.477
Ok.

37:01.679 --> 37:03.480
Ok.

37:33.351 --> 37:35.569
Don't do it!
Put it down!

37:37.247 --> 37:40.450
Hunter, give me the gun.

37:40.518 --> 37:41.918
He killed Doug!

37:41.969 --> 37:43.586
He was gonna kill me.

37:43.637 --> 37:46.122
I know. But if you
pull that trigger,

37:46.190 --> 37:48.525
it is gonna be you
going to prison and not him.

37:51.929 --> 37:54.030
I didn't ask
for any of this.

37:54.097 --> 37:55.782
I know.

37:55.866 --> 37:57.183
I know.

37:57.251 --> 38:00.269
Everything's gonna be ok.

38:00.321 --> 38:02.872
All right? Look, you--

38:02.940 --> 38:04.958
you just gotta trust me.

38:05.960 --> 38:08.378
Ok?

38:08.445 --> 38:10.079
Please.

38:13.784 --> 38:15.218
Ok.

38:28.933 --> 38:31.901
Spencer, I'm fine.

38:31.969 --> 38:33.319
I swear,
it's just a scratch.

38:33.404 --> 38:36.322
I don't know. I counted two cuts,
3 bruises, a black eye,

38:36.407 --> 38:37.490
and possibly
a fractured rib.

38:37.575 --> 38:38.858
I'm not telling you
how to do your job,

38:38.943 --> 38:40.994
but you should probably
consider giving her a CAT scan.

38:41.078 --> 38:42.211
You ok?
Ignore him.

38:42.279 --> 38:44.581
Yeah, I will be.

38:44.648 --> 38:46.032
What about him?

38:55.376 --> 38:58.511
"You may be deceived
if you trust too much,

38:58.596 --> 39:01.514
but you will live in torment
if you don't trust enough."

39:01.599 --> 39:03.750
Frank Crane.

39:05.019 --> 39:07.053
Look, JJ, all I'm saying
is I am never

39:07.137 --> 39:08.938
making you angry again.

39:09.006 --> 39:10.807
I mean, who knew
that Pennsylvania petite

39:10.858 --> 39:12.392
could give
such an ass-whuppin'?

39:12.476 --> 39:14.777
Well, I'm just glad
my hand-to-hand coach

39:14.845 --> 39:17.680
could work his schedule around
my state department duties.

39:17.731 --> 39:21.417
It's my pleasure. I'm just
really grateful it all paid off.

39:21.485 --> 39:23.770
You were great out there.

39:23.837 --> 39:25.104
I'm proud of you.

39:25.172 --> 39:27.040
Well, why don't you
get your little butt home.

39:27.124 --> 39:28.741
I'm sure Will's
waiting on you.

39:28.826 --> 39:31.694
Yeah, well, we did have
dinner reservations, but, uh,

39:31.745 --> 39:34.964
I'm thinking
we'll do takeout instead.

39:35.032 --> 39:37.366
Thanks, Derek.

39:37.418 --> 39:39.802
Yeah.

39:46.560 --> 39:47.510
Come in.

39:47.561 --> 39:49.512
Hey.
Hey.

39:49.563 --> 39:51.898
I thought I was the one supposed
to be burning the midnight oil.

39:51.982 --> 39:53.771
Well, with Strauss away,
the director asked me

39:53.796 --> 39:54.734
to do a little extra.

39:54.735 --> 39:57.153
I'm actually looking forward
to having her back.

39:57.220 --> 39:59.506
Right. It's not the greatest
way to spent Valentine's

39:59.531 --> 40:00.966
day, now, is it?

40:02.225 --> 40:03.343
I forgot, too.

40:03.410 --> 40:05.328
Some of the singles
were gonna go find a bar

40:05.395 --> 40:07.313
and grab a drink,
if you want to come along.

40:07.381 --> 40:09.415
I mean, unless there's
someplace else you could be.

40:09.500 --> 40:13.603
Uh, I think I'll pass,
but thank you.

40:13.671 --> 40:15.538
Uh, what about
the paperwork?

40:15.589 --> 40:17.540
Well, when Strauss
comes back next week,

40:17.591 --> 40:19.258
I don't want her
to be bored.

40:21.211 --> 40:22.128
Good night, Hotch.

40:22.212 --> 40:24.347
Good night, Morgan.

40:39.363 --> 40:41.280
Hey.
Hi.

40:41.365 --> 40:42.899
Flowers.
Wow, thank you.

40:42.950 --> 40:43.900
You're welcome.

40:43.951 --> 40:45.267
It's not even Friday.

40:45.319 --> 40:47.236
No, I know. I just
get called away so often,

40:47.287 --> 40:50.656
I thought we should grab the
opportunity while we had it.

40:50.741 --> 40:52.792
That was very thoughtful.

40:52.876 --> 40:54.460
Let me get my stuff.

40:54.545 --> 40:55.712
Ok.

41:00.968 --> 41:03.119
So what's our plan?

41:03.170 --> 41:04.286
Well, I suppose
I could tell you,

41:04.338 --> 41:05.955
but I don't want
to spoil the surprise,

41:06.006 --> 41:07.507
so you'll just
have to trust me.

41:07.591 --> 41:09.125
Oh. My first mistake.

41:09.176 --> 41:10.126
Oh.

41:10.177 --> 41:11.627
Did you forget something?

41:11.678 --> 41:12.895
This.

41:17.901 --> 41:20.686
I thought we ought to
get that out of the way.

41:20.771 --> 41:22.972
Spare us any awkwardness.

41:24.441 --> 41:28.494
You don't have the market
cornered on surprises, Aaron.

41:29.947 --> 41:32.365
You know, it's not often
that I'm speechless.

41:32.449 --> 41:33.366
Really?

41:33.450 --> 41:34.650
Yeah. But I am now.

41:34.701 --> 41:35.651
That's a nice car.

41:35.702 --> 41:37.370
Yeah.
