00:01.934 --> 00:04.687
Does it seem to you
that the ventriloquist dummy...

00:06.254 --> 00:09.610
...has a very active sexual,
social life?

00:10.054 --> 00:13.364
He's always talking about dates
and women that he knows...

00:13.534 --> 00:15.729
...and bringing them back
to the suitcase at night.

00:15.894 --> 00:19.250
There's always a sawdust joke
in there somewhere, you know.

00:19.494 --> 00:21.962
He says kinky things,
because he's made out of wood...

00:22.134 --> 00:23.647
...and he can spin his head around.

00:24.014 --> 00:26.767
We're somehow expected to believe...

00:27.174 --> 00:29.734
...because the face is so animated...

00:29.894 --> 00:32.806
...they think we're not noticing
the feet are just swinging there.

00:32.974 --> 00:35.044
Dummy feet never look
really right, do they?

00:35.214 --> 00:38.729
They're just kind of dangling there.
Always kind of askew, you know.

00:38.894 --> 00:40.247
You always see a little ankle.

00:40.414 --> 00:43.326
Those little thin, fabric ankles
that they have, you know.

00:43.494 --> 00:46.213
You think,
"I don't think this thing is real."

00:49.414 --> 00:51.370
Are you kidding me?

00:51.534 --> 00:53.650
Let me speak with the head librarian.
It's absurd.

00:56.174 --> 00:59.883
An overdue book from 1971?

01:00.054 --> 01:02.887
This is a joke, right? What are you,
from a radio station?

01:03.054 --> 01:06.649
Okay, you got me. I fell for it.

01:07.054 --> 01:08.453
All right. Okay.

01:08.614 --> 01:10.889
I can be down there
in, like, a half-hour.

01:11.054 --> 01:12.248
Bye.

01:12.734 --> 01:15.009
- What's the problem?
- This, you're not gonna believe.

01:15.174 --> 01:17.608
The New York Public Library...

01:17.774 --> 01:22.245
...says that I took out
Tropic of Cancer in 1971...

01:22.414 --> 01:23.972
...and never returned it.

01:24.134 --> 01:26.694
Do you know how much
that comes to?

01:26.894 --> 01:29.249
That's a nickel a day for 20 years.

01:29.414 --> 01:31.689
- It's gonna be $50,000.
- It doesn't work like that.

01:31.854 --> 01:33.765
If it's a dime a day,
it could be 100,000.

01:33.934 --> 01:35.526
It's not gonna be anything.

01:35.694 --> 01:38.049
I returned the book.
I remember it very vividly...

01:38.214 --> 01:40.011
...because I was with Sherry Becker.

01:40.174 --> 01:43.530
She wore this orange dress. It's the
first time I saw her in a dress like that.

01:43.694 --> 01:46.891
I'd known her since ninth grade. She
was developing this body in secret...

01:47.054 --> 01:49.284
...under these loose clothes
for, like, two years.

01:49.454 --> 01:50.933
And then one day...

01:51.814 --> 01:53.930
...this orange dress.

01:54.974 --> 01:58.728
- It's burned in my memory.
- Oh, memory burn, huh?

01:58.894 --> 02:01.454
- I wonder whatever happened to her.
- How did they find you?

02:01.774 --> 02:05.289
Oh, computers. They're cracking down
now on overdue books.

02:05.454 --> 02:08.332
The whole thing's
completely ridiculous.

02:08.814 --> 02:12.329
It's George. Wait till he finds out we're
going to the library. He'll be thrilled.

02:12.494 --> 02:15.850
- You know, I never got a library card.
- I'm coming down.

02:16.014 --> 02:18.244
It's all a bunch of cheapskates
in there anyway.

02:18.414 --> 02:20.325
People sitting around
reading the newspaper...

02:20.494 --> 02:23.008
...attached to those huge
wooden sticks...

02:23.174 --> 02:25.244
...trying to save a quarter.

02:25.654 --> 02:28.009
Look, I gotta go to the library.
You wanna go?

02:28.174 --> 02:30.404
Yeah, yeah. Let's go.

02:38.774 --> 02:42.687
The Dewey Decimal System.
What a scam that was.

02:42.854 --> 02:47.052
Boy, this Dewey guy
really cleaned up on that deal.

02:47.214 --> 02:49.205
Where's George?

02:49.614 --> 02:52.367
Look. Trying to save a quarter.

02:52.534 --> 02:56.049
I kind of like those sticks.
I'd like to get them in my house.

03:01.694 --> 03:04.083
This woman's completely
ignoring me.

03:04.254 --> 03:05.607
Look at her.

03:05.774 --> 03:09.449
This is a lonely woman
looking for companionship.

03:10.334 --> 03:12.290
A spinster.

03:12.694 --> 03:14.730
Maybe a virgin.

03:16.014 --> 03:20.132
Maybe she got hurt a long time ago.
She's a schoolgirl...

03:20.294 --> 03:22.410
...there was a boy. It didn't work out.

03:22.574 --> 03:27.443
So now she needs a little tenderness.
She needs a little understanding.

03:27.614 --> 03:29.844
Needs a little Kramer, huh?

03:32.654 --> 03:35.373
Then she'll need
a little shot of penicillin.

03:37.134 --> 03:38.886
- Yes?
- Yeah, I called before.

03:39.054 --> 03:41.204
I got this notice in the mail.

03:42.974 --> 03:46.853
Tropic of Cancer. Henry Miller.

03:48.654 --> 03:51.851
This case has been turned over to our
investigations officer, Mr. Bookman.

03:52.014 --> 03:53.208
Bookman?

03:53.374 --> 03:56.650
The library investigator's name is
actually Bookman?

03:56.814 --> 03:58.088
- Come on.
- It's true.

03:58.254 --> 03:59.448
That's amazing.

03:59.614 --> 04:02.572
That's like an ice-cream man
named Cone.

04:02.734 --> 04:05.089
Well, Lieutenant Bookman's
been working here 25 years...

04:05.254 --> 04:06.573
...so he's heard all the jokes.

04:06.894 --> 04:09.408
- Can I speak with this Bookman?
- Just a second.

04:12.894 --> 04:15.044
Jerry.

04:15.374 --> 04:16.567
What?

04:17.334 --> 04:18.733
I think I saw him.

04:18.894 --> 04:20.805
- I think it's him.
- Who?

04:20.974 --> 04:23.204
Did you see the homeless guy
on the library steps...

04:23.374 --> 04:25.569
...screaming obscenities
and doing callisthenics?

04:25.734 --> 04:28.885
- Yeah.
- I think that's Mr. Heyman.

04:29.294 --> 04:30.886
The gym teacher from our high school.

04:33.814 --> 04:36.408
- Heyman? Are you sure?
- He's older...

04:36.574 --> 04:41.125
...completely covered in filth,
no whistle. But I think it's him.

04:42.814 --> 04:44.805
George got him fired.
He squealed on him.

04:44.974 --> 04:47.169
- Oh, tattletale.
- I didn't tattle.

04:49.614 --> 04:51.366
Well, what did this guy do?
What happened?

04:51.534 --> 04:53.604
There was an incident.
I'd rather not discuss it.

04:53.774 --> 04:55.844
- Oh, come on. You can tell me.
- Some other time.

04:56.014 --> 04:57.811
What, tonight?

04:58.894 --> 05:02.728
- I never figured you for a squealer.
- He sang like a canary.

05:02.894 --> 05:04.532
- Mr. Bookman's not here.
- Not here?

05:04.694 --> 05:07.845
- Why was I told to come down here?
- He'll be out all afternoon on a case.

05:08.014 --> 05:11.051
He's out on a case?
He actually goes out on cases?

05:11.974 --> 05:13.293
What am I supposed to do now?

05:13.454 --> 05:15.331
I'll have Mr. Bookman
get in touch with you.

05:16.174 --> 05:17.812
All right. Thanks.

05:17.974 --> 05:20.124
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go see if it's Heyman.

05:20.294 --> 05:24.287
- It's not him.
- Hey, I'll see you boys later, huh?

05:28.534 --> 05:32.812
So, what's a guy gotta do around here
to get a library card?

05:34.000 --> 05:40.074

05:43.374 --> 05:46.047
- Where's Karen?
- She went to pick up lunch.

05:47.374 --> 05:48.568
Well...

05:49.414 --> 05:51.689
...she didn't ask me what I wanted.

05:51.854 --> 05:54.084
She must've forgot.

05:54.974 --> 05:57.010
How could she forget?
I've been ordering lunch...

05:57.174 --> 05:58.892
...every day for three and a half years.

05:59.774 --> 06:01.571
Is there something
you're not telling me...

06:01.734 --> 06:03.850
...because I'm getting, like,
a really weird vibe.

06:05.094 --> 06:07.130
Is Lippman getting rid of me?
You can tell me.

06:07.294 --> 06:09.888
- I won't say anything.
- I don't know anything.

06:11.174 --> 06:13.324
You don't know. You see,
"I don't know anything"...

06:13.494 --> 06:16.406
...means there's something to know.
If you really didn't, you'd say:

06:16.574 --> 06:18.166
"You're crazy."

06:18.334 --> 06:21.212
- Oh, hi, Mr. Lippman.
- Elaine.

06:22.694 --> 06:24.730
I was wondering
if you got a chance...

06:24.894 --> 06:27.852
...to look at that biography
of Columbus I gave you.

06:28.014 --> 06:29.811
Yes, I did.

06:31.014 --> 06:32.845
Yes, I did.

06:34.094 --> 06:38.167
- Marie, this water is still too cold.
- Oh, yeah. It's freezing.

06:40.174 --> 06:42.324
Hurts your teeth.

06:47.214 --> 06:49.364
I'm telling you,
something is going on.

06:49.534 --> 06:53.004
He never likes anything I recommend,
and then that lunch thing.

06:53.174 --> 06:55.210
So they forgot to get your lunch.
Big deal.

06:55.374 --> 06:58.093
What do you know?
You've never worked in an office.

06:58.254 --> 07:00.609
See, you've worked in an office,
George. You understand.

07:00.774 --> 07:04.005
Jerry thinks I'm overreacting,
but you understand lunch.

07:04.374 --> 07:06.808
I don't understand lunch.
I don't know anything about it.

07:07.174 --> 07:10.723
Just because I got the guy fired doesn't
mean I turned him into a bum, does it?

07:10.894 --> 07:12.373
- What did he do?
- He purposely...

07:12.534 --> 07:14.286
...mispronounced my name.

07:14.454 --> 07:16.251
Instead of saying Costanza...

07:16.414 --> 07:20.646
...he'd say, " Can't stand you.
Can't stand you."

07:21.174 --> 07:24.052
Remember, he made me smell
my own gym socks once?

07:24.214 --> 07:27.968
I remember he made you wear a jock
on your head for a whole class.

07:28.334 --> 07:31.565
- And the straps were hanging down...
- Okay, okay.

07:31.734 --> 07:33.133
You never even had him for gym.

07:33.294 --> 07:35.683
I had him for hygiene.
Remember his teeth?

07:35.854 --> 07:37.924
It was like from an exhumed corpse.

07:38.294 --> 07:40.808
Little baked beans.

07:42.254 --> 07:45.132
Come on, tell me what happened.

07:45.774 --> 07:47.526
Well, okay.

07:47.694 --> 07:50.162
As I said, the guy had it in for me.

07:50.334 --> 07:53.883
He actually failed me in gym. Me.

07:54.414 --> 07:57.292
And those spastic Schnitzer twins.

07:57.574 --> 07:59.804
- Can't stand you!
- Yes, Mr. Heyman?

07:59.974 --> 08:02.966
Your underwear was sticking out
of your shorts during gym class.

08:03.134 --> 08:05.125
Well, that's because
I wear boxer shorts.

08:05.294 --> 08:06.886
Boxer shorts, huh?

08:07.054 --> 08:09.124
- What brand?
- I'm not really sure. l...

08:09.294 --> 08:11.569
Yeah, well, let's take a look!

08:12.734 --> 08:14.247
He gave me a wedgie.

08:14.414 --> 08:16.484
And he got fired the next day.

08:16.814 --> 08:18.247
Why do they call it a "wedgie"?

08:18.414 --> 08:21.963
Because the underwear is pulled up
from the back until it...

08:22.134 --> 08:23.965
...wedges in.

08:24.734 --> 08:27.373
They also have an atomic wedgie.

08:27.534 --> 08:30.765
Now, the goal there is to actually
get the waistband...

08:30.934 --> 08:32.970
...on top of the head.

08:33.174 --> 08:35.164
It's very rare.

08:36.294 --> 08:38.761
- Boys are sick.
- Well, what do girls do?

08:38.933 --> 08:42.609
We just tease someone till they
develop an eating disorder.

08:43.933 --> 08:46.050
I gotta go back to the library
and talk to him.

08:46.214 --> 08:49.047
I gotta find out if I'm the guy
that ruined his life.

08:49.214 --> 08:51.045
Hey, babaloo, you better get home.

08:51.214 --> 08:53.887
This guy Bookman from the library,
he's waiting for you.

08:54.854 --> 08:56.333
What's amazing about the library...

08:56.494 --> 08:58.325
...is here's a place
where you can go in...

08:58.494 --> 09:01.008
...take out any book you want.
They just give it to you...

09:01.174 --> 09:03.642
...and say, " Bring it back
when you're done."

09:03.814 --> 09:06.408
Reminds you of that pathetic friend
everybody had as a kid...

09:06.574 --> 09:10.123
...that would let you borrow any of his
stuff if you would just be his friend.

09:10.294 --> 09:14.082
That's what the library is. It's
a government-funded pathetic friend.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.165
That's why everybody
bullies the library.

09:16.334 --> 09:18.564
"I'll bring it back on time,
I'll bring it back late.

09:18.734 --> 09:21.089
What are you gonna do,
charge me a nickel?"

09:22.974 --> 09:25.169
I'm glad you're here so we can
straighten this out.

09:25.334 --> 09:26.687
- Cup of tea?
- Got any coffee?

09:26.854 --> 09:27.923
- Coffee?
- Yeah, coffee.

09:28.094 --> 09:29.925
- No, I don't drink coffee.
- You don't?

09:30.094 --> 09:31.846
- How about instant coffee?
- No, I don't...

09:32.014 --> 09:33.766
- No instant coffee?
- Well, I don't...

09:33.934 --> 09:35.970
- Who doesn't have instant coffee?
- I don't.

09:36.134 --> 09:39.365
Buy a jar of Folgers crystals, put it in
the cupboard, you forget about it.

09:39.534 --> 09:41.490
When you need it, it's there.
It lasts forever.

09:41.654 --> 09:44.122
It's freeze-dried.
Freeze-dried crystals.

09:45.694 --> 09:47.366
Really? I'll have to remember that.

09:47.694 --> 09:51.004
- You took this book out in 1971.
- Yes, and I returned it in 1971.

09:51.174 --> 09:53.563
Yeah, '71, that was my first year
on the job.

09:53.734 --> 09:56.328
Bad year for libraries.
Bad year for America.

09:56.974 --> 09:58.805
Hippies burning library cards.

09:58.974 --> 10:01.534
Abbie Hoffman telling everybody
to steal books.

10:01.854 --> 10:04.163
I don't judge a man by hair length
or musical taste.

10:04.334 --> 10:05.528
Rock was never my bag.

10:05.854 --> 10:08.926
But you put on a pair of shoes
in the New York Public Library, fella.

10:09.094 --> 10:11.244
Look, Mr. Bookman...

10:12.974 --> 10:15.647
...I returned that book.
I remember it very specifically.

10:15.814 --> 10:17.770
You're a comedian.
You make people laugh.

10:17.934 --> 10:20.448
- I try.
- You think this is all a big joke?

10:22.254 --> 10:23.653
No, I don't.

10:23.814 --> 10:26.408
I saw you on TV once.
I remembered your name from my list.

10:26.574 --> 10:28.963
I looked it up.
Sure enough, it checked out.

10:29.134 --> 10:32.126
You think because you're a celebrity,
somehow the law doesn't apply?

10:32.294 --> 10:34.046
- You're above the law?
- Certainly not.

10:34.214 --> 10:36.648
Well, let me tell you something,
funny boy.

10:37.054 --> 10:40.126
You know that little stamp, the one
that says "New York Public Library"?

10:40.294 --> 10:41.773
That may not mean anything to you.

10:41.934 --> 10:44.323
But that means a lot to me.
One whole hell of a lot.

10:44.494 --> 10:47.566
Sure, go ahead. Laugh if you want to.
I've seen your type before.

10:47.734 --> 10:51.363
Flashy, making a scene,
flaunting convention.

10:51.534 --> 10:53.047
Yeah, I know what you're thinking:

10:53.214 --> 10:55.853
"Why's this guy making such a stink
about old library books?"

10:56.414 --> 10:58.882
Well, let me give you a hint, junior.

10:59.374 --> 11:02.446
Maybe we can live without libraries,
people like you and me. Maybe.

11:02.614 --> 11:04.650
Sure, we're too old
to change the world.

11:04.814 --> 11:07.692
But what about that kid sitting down
opening a book right now...

11:07.854 --> 11:09.765
...in a branch at the local library...

11:09.934 --> 11:13.290
...and finding drawings
of pee-pees and wee-wees...

11:15.054 --> 11:18.683
...in The Cat in the Hat
and The Five Chinese Brothers?

11:18.854 --> 11:20.048
Doesn't he deserve better?

11:20.214 --> 11:23.365
Look, if you think this is about
overdue fines and missing books...

11:23.534 --> 11:26.094
...you better think again.
This is about that kid's right...

11:26.254 --> 11:28.484
...to read a book without
getting his mind warped.

11:28.654 --> 11:30.690
Or maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld.

11:30.854 --> 11:34.608
Maybe that's how you get your kicks,
you and your good-time buddies.

11:34.774 --> 11:37.607
Well, I got a flash for you, joy-boy:

11:40.854 --> 11:42.082
Party time is over.

11:43.134 --> 11:45.807
You got seven days, Seinfeld.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.564
That is one week.

11:53.374 --> 11:56.684
- What's wrong?
- It's Bookman, the library cop.

11:57.134 --> 11:59.853
- So? I didn't do anything wrong.
- I'm supposed to be at work.

12:00.014 --> 12:03.324
I could get fired.
I never should've come here.

12:04.654 --> 12:06.963
Why don't you leave?

12:10.174 --> 12:12.563
I can't.

12:14.014 --> 12:18.724
There's no way I'm paying that!
I returned that book in 1971!

12:18.894 --> 12:21.249
I have a witness. Sherry Becker.

12:21.414 --> 12:23.803
She wore an orange dress.

12:23.974 --> 12:25.612
She gave me a piece
of Black Jack gum.

12:25.774 --> 12:29.005
I said, " Liquorice gum.
What will they think of next?"

12:29.174 --> 12:30.812
I remember it!

12:36.094 --> 12:38.164
Becker, Becker...

12:49.854 --> 12:51.492
Kevin went to a public school.

12:51.654 --> 12:53.133
He's the 14 year old.

12:53.294 --> 12:56.206
We were gonna send Marsha
to a private school...

12:56.614 --> 12:59.208
...because in some ways, they don't...

12:59.374 --> 13:02.093
...learn enough, I think.

13:02.254 --> 13:05.769
So, Sherry, what do you remember
about that day at the library?

13:06.414 --> 13:09.451
I remember it like it was yesterday.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.525
It was a Friday afternoon.

13:11.694 --> 13:14.925
- I wore a purple dress.
- Purple?

13:15.094 --> 13:17.608
- You sure it wasn't orange?
- Positive.

13:17.774 --> 13:20.493
And I was chewing Dentyne.

13:20.654 --> 13:23.691
I always chewed Dentyne.

13:23.854 --> 13:26.732
Remember, Jerry? Dentyne?

13:28.374 --> 13:32.162
- No Black Jack?
- Liquorice gum? Never.

13:32.334 --> 13:34.086
What else?

13:34.414 --> 13:35.608
We were...

13:35.774 --> 13:39.847
...reading passages to each other
from that Henry Miller book you had.

13:40.014 --> 13:42.574
- Tropic of Cancer.
- No.

13:42.734 --> 13:44.326
Tropic of Capricorn.

13:44.854 --> 13:48.893
- Tropic of Capricorn?
- Remember?

13:49.214 --> 13:51.523
"What holds the world together...

13:51.694 --> 13:55.767
...as I have learned from
bitter experience...

13:55.934 --> 13:59.006
...is sexual intercourse."

14:02.494 --> 14:05.770
Wait a second, wait a second.
You're right. I had both of them.

14:05.934 --> 14:07.492
We read from Tropic of Capricorn.

14:07.654 --> 14:11.533
I was all set to return Tropic of Cancer.
And then...

14:12.574 --> 14:14.371
- George, here's the book.
- Oh, man.

14:14.534 --> 14:16.968
Don't let anybody see it.
Don't let anything happen to it.

14:17.134 --> 14:19.728
Jerry, it's me, George. Don't worry.
I'll return it tomorrow.

14:19.894 --> 14:23.204
All right. I'll see you after school.
I'm late for Heyman's hygiene.

14:25.134 --> 14:27.807
- Where are you going?
- It was nice seeing you again.

14:27.974 --> 14:29.885
I just remembered something.
I've gotta go.

14:31.054 --> 14:33.409
It was George!

14:35.374 --> 14:37.171
Read another poem.

14:37.454 --> 14:41.333
Pressed chest
Fleshed out west

14:41.494 --> 14:43.485
Might be the saviour

14:43.654 --> 14:45.292
Or a garden pest

14:46.494 --> 14:50.043
That is great poetry.
You should be published.

14:50.214 --> 14:52.091
It's great.

14:54.454 --> 14:56.968
Well, the library's kind of a cool place
when it's closed.

14:57.134 --> 14:59.523
Oh, yeah. You don't have to be quiet.

14:59.694 --> 15:01.207
Listen to the echo.

15:01.374 --> 15:03.126
- Hello!
- Hello!

15:03.294 --> 15:05.569
- Hello!
- Hello!

15:05.734 --> 15:07.213
- Hello!
- Hello.

15:10.654 --> 15:11.848
Mr. Bookman.

15:12.014 --> 15:15.370
I remember when the librarian was
a much older woman.

15:15.534 --> 15:18.094
Kindly, discreet, unattractive.

15:18.694 --> 15:20.650
We didn't know anything
about her private life.

15:20.814 --> 15:22.884
We didn't wanna know
about her private life.

15:23.054 --> 15:25.443
She didn't have a private life.

15:25.614 --> 15:27.525
When you think about that,
think about this:

15:27.694 --> 15:30.254
The library closes at 5:00,
no exceptions.

15:30.414 --> 15:32.086
This is your final warning.

15:32.254 --> 15:34.563
Got that, kewpie doll?

15:38.494 --> 15:41.088
Lippman wants to see me
in his office.

15:41.254 --> 15:44.963
- See me. That can't be good.
- Maybe you're getting a raise.

15:45.134 --> 15:47.523
Maybe I'm getting a wedgie.

15:50.894 --> 15:52.850
- What?
- It's George.

15:53.014 --> 15:57.087
- George is on his way up.
- Wait till I tell him about the book.

15:58.494 --> 16:00.291
Are you okay?

16:00.454 --> 16:05.608
- What?
- It's... It's Marion's poetry.

16:05.774 --> 16:09.289
- I can't take it!
- Oh, Kramer.

16:13.454 --> 16:16.014
Remember that biography
I recommended?

16:16.174 --> 16:18.563
- My boss hated it!
- I'm right here.

16:18.734 --> 16:20.645
Oh, sorry.

16:21.454 --> 16:25.766
- Remember that Columbus book?
- Columbus. Eurotrash.

16:37.574 --> 16:39.849
Well, it's definitely him.

16:41.974 --> 16:45.284
- Him? Him who?
- Him who?

16:45.454 --> 16:47.206
Heyman him.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.126
Heyman, the gym teacher?

16:49.294 --> 16:52.127
- You found him?
- Oh, I found him.

16:52.294 --> 16:54.410
He was sitting on the steps
of the library.

16:54.574 --> 16:55.848
I sat down next to him.

16:56.614 --> 16:59.526
He smelled like the locker room
after that game against Erasmus.

16:59.694 --> 17:01.571
That was double overtime.

17:01.814 --> 17:03.486
I said, " Mr. Heyman...

17:03.654 --> 17:06.167
...it's me, George Costanza.

17:06.334 --> 17:08.768
JFK, '71."

17:08.934 --> 17:10.810
He doesn't move.

17:11.013 --> 17:12.652
So I said:

17:12.814 --> 17:16.807
"Can't stand you. Can't stand you."

17:17.174 --> 17:19.768
He turns and smiles.

17:19.934 --> 17:22.573
The little baked-bean teeth.

17:23.054 --> 17:25.124
I get up to run away...

17:25.294 --> 17:28.604
...but something was holding me back.

17:29.454 --> 17:31.365
It was Heyman.

17:33.134 --> 17:34.886
He had my underwear.

17:37.614 --> 17:42.404
Here I was on the steps
of the 42nd Street library...

17:42.574 --> 17:44.769
...a grown man...

17:45.454 --> 17:47.285
...getting a wedgie.

17:49.614 --> 17:51.013
At least it wasn't atomic.

17:53.054 --> 17:54.965
It was.

17:58.774 --> 18:02.892
So, Georgie boy, guess what
happened to Tropic of Cancer.

18:03.054 --> 18:05.363
- How should I know?
- Because I gave it to you.

18:05.534 --> 18:06.728
- Me?
- Yeah, think.

18:06.894 --> 18:09.169
Don't you remember?
You kept begging me to see it.

18:09.334 --> 18:11.052
Then finally, I agreed.

18:11.414 --> 18:14.008
You were supposed to return it.

18:14.174 --> 18:17.132
I met you in the gym locker room
and gave it to you.

18:18.094 --> 18:19.288
The locker room.

18:20.014 --> 18:21.891
- George, here's the book.
- Oh, man.

18:22.054 --> 18:24.488
Don't let anybody see it.
Don't let anything happen to it.

18:24.654 --> 18:26.963
It's me, George. Don't worry.
I'll return it tomorrow.

18:27.134 --> 18:30.649
All right. I'll see you after school.
I'm late for Heyman's hygiene.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.450
- Can't stand you!
- Yes, Mr. Heyman?

18:36.614 --> 18:39.924
Your underwear was sticking out
of your shorts during gym class.

18:40.094 --> 18:43.211
- That's because I wear boxer shorts.
- Boxer shorts, huh?

18:43.374 --> 18:45.444
- What brand?
- I'm not really sure.

18:45.614 --> 18:47.844
Yeah, well, let's take a look!

19:00.254 --> 19:03.690
Anyway, I hope there's
no hard feelings.

19:05.294 --> 19:08.445
Hard feelings? What do you know
about hard feelings?

19:10.534 --> 19:13.651
Ever have a man die in your arms?
Ever kill somebody?

19:13.814 --> 19:15.884
- What is your problem?
- What's my problem?

19:16.054 --> 19:18.693
Punks like you. That's my problem.

19:18.854 --> 19:20.492
You better not
screw up again, Seinfeld.

19:20.654 --> 19:23.691
Because if you do, I'll be all over you
like a pit bull on a poodle.

19:27.054 --> 19:29.852
That is one tough monkey.

19:30.734 --> 19:34.568
- So you were saying?
- So I took your suggestion...

19:34.734 --> 19:36.964
...and I gave my boss
Marion's poems...

19:37.134 --> 19:38.886
...the ones that affected
Kramer so much.

19:39.054 --> 19:43.013
- Oh, beautiful. Did he like them?
- No, he didn't.

19:44.374 --> 19:47.093
No, he didn't.

19:48.814 --> 19:51.851
- Was he out there?
- No, he's gone.

19:52.334 --> 19:56.168
- I wonder what happened to him.
- I guess we'll never know.

20:02.894 --> 20:04.327
Can't stand you.

20:04.494 --> 20:08.931
Can't stand you. Can't stand you.

20:09.094 --> 20:11.654
Can't stand you.

20:13.494 --> 20:15.769
Any day that you had gym...

20:15.934 --> 20:18.050
...was a weird school day.

20:18.214 --> 20:20.409
You know what I mean?
It started off kind of normal.

20:20.574 --> 20:23.372
You have, like, English, geometry,
social studies...

20:23.534 --> 20:26.606
...and then suddenly, you're, like,
in Lord of the Flies for 40 minutes.

20:26.774 --> 20:29.846
You're hanging from a rope.
You have hardly any clothes on.

20:30.014 --> 20:33.290
Teachers are yelling at you,
"Where's your jockstrap?" You know.

20:33.454 --> 20:37.572
Kids are throwing dodge balls at you.
You're trying to survive.

20:38.014 --> 20:39.686
Then it's history...

20:39.854 --> 20:41.651
...science, language.

20:41.814 --> 20:44.965
There's something off
in the whole flow of that day.
