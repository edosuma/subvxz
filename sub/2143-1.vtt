00:56.683 --> 00:59.436
It is the biggest cash robbery
in U.S. history...

00:59.602 --> 01:01.438
$8 million taken

01:01.604 --> 01:03.690
from an armored-car company
office in New York City.

01:03.857 --> 01:04.858
There may have been close

01:05.024 --> 01:06.693
to $30 million here yesterday,

01:06.860 --> 01:09.863
all in cash,
mostly 50s and hundreds.

01:10.029 --> 01:11.865
A task force of FBI agents

01:12.031 --> 01:14.492
and New York City detectives
are trying to solve

01:14.659 --> 01:16.870
the biggest cash robbery
in U.S. history.

01:17.036 --> 01:19.539
FBI and New York City
police investigators

01:19.706 --> 01:22.459
swarmed over the roof
of a Bronx armored-truck company

01:22.625 --> 01:24.419
after thieves cut a hole in the roof

01:24.586 --> 01:27.213
and made off with the largest
cash theft in U.S. history.

01:27.380 --> 01:30.049
Police also said that a television
camera pointed at the vault

01:30.216 --> 01:31.885
had been moved,
leading to speculation

01:32.051 --> 01:33.720
that the burglars
had inside help.

01:33.887 --> 01:36.222
At this point not one penny
has been recovered.

01:36.389 --> 01:39.392
But FBI officials say they're
working on a number of good leads

01:39.559 --> 01:42.103
and are optimistic
about finding the money.

01:42.270 --> 01:45.565
If I knew, I would be out there
with a shovel looking for it.

01:45.732 --> 01:48.443
We really don't know
right at the moment.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.406
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

01:53.573 --> 01:55.909
Two questions for you, Eddie:

01:57.869 --> 01:59.746
Where's Chris?

02:06.336 --> 02:08.505
And where's the money?

02:21.392 --> 02:23.269
I quit.

02:23.436 --> 02:24.854
Fucking douchebags.

02:25.021 --> 02:27.398
- Naw, you're fired.
- What?

02:27.565 --> 02:29.234
- You're fired.
- No, bro, I quit.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.800
You can't quit. You quit every week
from somewhere different.

02:31.945 --> 02:33.425
- You're fired.
- Yeah, that's right.

02:33.571 --> 02:35.615
- Yeah, I fucking quit, all right?
- Oh, shut up.

02:35.782 --> 02:37.992
- You're fired.
- What? What's that?

02:38.159 --> 02:40.578
Yo, you want me to pick up trash?
What fucking color do I look like?

02:40.745 --> 02:42.622
- You are the trash, you little fuck.
- Motherfucker.

02:42.789 --> 02:44.165
Yo yo yo Yo YÂ°-

02:44.332 --> 02:46.209
What, you want some?

02:46.376 --> 02:48.776
- Get going, get outta here.
- How about that, you fat fuck?

02:48.920 --> 02:50.440
- Come on.
- Get outta here, get going.

02:50.463 --> 02:52.090
- Come on, let's go.
- And you're fired!

02:52.257 --> 02:54.384
- You're fired!
- I quit, motherfucker.

02:54.551 --> 02:57.345
No no no, you're fired!

03:03.810 --> 03:05.144
Yo, what the fuck?

03:05.311 --> 03:07.021
- That was your boss?
- Yeah.

03:07.188 --> 03:08.898
Yeah, he wants me
to clean up garbage.

03:09.065 --> 03:11.585
I'm like, "Yo, what color
do I look like to you again, asshole?"

03:11.734 --> 03:13.486
I hate Italians, bro.

03:13.653 --> 03:16.322
Nothing's worse than working
for Italians, let me tell you.

03:16.489 --> 03:18.825
Only thing worse than working
for Italians is working for the Greeks,

03:18.992 --> 03:21.661
and I have to go back and work
at that stupid diner again.

03:23.121 --> 03:25.665
Bullshit. The guy's
a straight-up douche, bro.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.460
He's telling me he thinks
I'm stealing and stuff.

03:29.627 --> 03:31.087
You said you were.

03:32.589 --> 03:35.133
I was, but he's still a dick.
How about that?

03:35.300 --> 03:37.510
Only thing worse is the Greeks.

03:37.677 --> 03:39.637
Hey, what's up, ladies?

03:39.804 --> 03:41.347
Yo, any of you girls

03:41.514 --> 03:42.849
wanna do me right now, I'm down.

03:43.016 --> 03:45.226
Eleni must be real stupid
marrying you, idiot!

03:45.393 --> 03:46.853
- Suck it!
- Douchebag!

03:48.313 --> 03:51.357
There's a rainbow
over my shoulder

03:51.524 --> 03:56.321
When you came,
my cup runneth over

03:56.487 --> 03:59.908
You gave me your heavenly love

04:00.074 --> 04:04.203
And if one night
you hear crying from above

04:04.370 --> 04:06.205
'Cause heaven

04:07.707 --> 04:10.043
Must be missing an angel

04:11.544 --> 04:14.005
Missing one angel child

04:14.172 --> 04:17.634
Because you're here
with me right now

04:19.802 --> 04:21.803
Your love is heavenly

04:21.971 --> 04:24.057
Bab)!

04:24.223 --> 04:28.019
Heavenly to me, baby

04:28.186 --> 04:30.647
Heaven

04:32.899 --> 04:35.610
- Heaven...
- Enough with the chickens, Karen.

04:35.777 --> 04:38.071
You gotta stop with the chickens.

04:39.072 --> 04:40.823
She's crazy about the chickens.

04:50.416 --> 04:52.543
- Fucking bit my lip.
- Hey, give me a hand with this.

04:52.710 --> 04:54.545
Son of a bitch. Bit my lip.

04:54.712 --> 04:57.340
Hey, are you really
gonna marry Eleni?

04:57.507 --> 05:00.510
<i>- You sound like my mother.
- You're not gonna marry nobody.</i>

05:00.677 --> 05:03.763
Not for nothing, bro, but if they make
a statue of me, I want big balls.

05:03.930 --> 05:06.224
- Know what I'm saying?
- Hey, Ma!

05:06.391 --> 05:08.267
<i>- We come bearing gifts.
- What's this?</i>

05:08.434 --> 05:10.311
I got you a statue...
the statue you wanted.

05:10.478 --> 05:11.813
- Nice.
- Hey.

05:11.980 --> 05:14.190
Do I get a kiss? Thank you.

05:14.357 --> 05:16.818
<i>- Where did you get this?
- You could put a plant in it.</i>

05:16.985 --> 05:18.444
<i>- What, you don't like it?
- It's nice, it's nice.</i>

05:18.611 --> 05:19.988
- Put it right there.
- Put it over here?

05:20.154 --> 05:22.073
- Yeah, right there against the wall.
- Okay.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.120
- Nice.
- I'm just saying if you don't like it,

05:24.283 --> 05:26.661
- we can take it back.
- I like it, I like it!

05:26.828 --> 05:28.121
- It's nice.
- Where, over here?

05:28.287 --> 05:30.331
- You want it on this thing?
- Mrs. Potamitis...

05:30.498 --> 05:32.208
- Hey, Ma.
- Please be careful with those plants.

05:32.375 --> 05:33.793
- Stand it up, stand it up.
- You want it somewhere...

05:33.960 --> 05:35.200
- You like that?
- That's good.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.216
- There we go. How about that?
- You like that?

05:37.255 --> 05:39.924
- Ma!
- It's good, I like it. It's beautiful.

05:40.091 --> 05:41.259
What do you want me
to do with the turtle?

05:41.426 --> 05:42.927
Would you like me to tell you
what to do with the turtle?

05:43.094 --> 05:44.762
<i>- Put it down and don't break it.
- You don't like it?</i>

05:44.929 --> 05:46.973
- Put that over there.
- Thank you, Chris. It's very nice.

05:47.140 --> 05:48.766
<i>- You like that, Ma?
- Thank you, yes, thank you.</i>

05:48.933 --> 05:51.102
<i>- We got presents for you.
- Good good good.</i>

05:51.269 --> 05:53.813
You be good today, all right?
Be careful, all right?

05:53.980 --> 05:55.732
You want me to move it,
I move it again.

05:55.898 --> 05:57.650
You don't like it, we'll take it back.

05:57.817 --> 05:59.318
- Go go go.
- You don't have to do it, you know?

05:59.485 --> 06:01.404
All right, enough! Go.

06:01.571 --> 06:03.197
Okay, love you, Ma.

06:35.063 --> 06:37.607
Hey, Spiro. My father around?

06:38.941 --> 06:40.443
In the shitter, kid.

06:49.869 --> 06:51.287
- H6Y-
- H6Y-

06:51.454 --> 06:53.372
Chris.

06:53.539 --> 06:56.834
They got you doing everything
around here, Pop?

06:57.001 --> 06:58.086
Yeah.

06:59.170 --> 07:02.799
You know, this is what happens
when you have too many skills, right?

07:02.965 --> 07:05.343
So where's the girl?

07:05.510 --> 07:06.636
I don't know.

07:06.803 --> 07:08.638
I was just seeing
if you need a ride home.

07:08.805 --> 07:10.723
- You know, checking up on you.
- Come in here on a Friday night

07:10.890 --> 07:13.226
- to give me a ride home?
- No no, I didn't say...

07:13.392 --> 07:14.852
I'm worried about you.
What are you doing?

07:15.019 --> 07:16.562
Just stopping bY

07:23.694 --> 07:25.446
What, I come in,
everybody goes quiet?

07:25.613 --> 07:27.073
No no, we were just talking.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.408
You don't like that fat asshole

07:29.575 --> 07:31.536
talking that way about your father.

07:31.702 --> 07:34.163
Chris doesn't need
to worry about his father.

07:34.330 --> 07:36.666
No no, you're right, Tommy.
I'm sorry.

07:36.833 --> 07:40.002
But we agree
he's a fat asshole though.

07:40.169 --> 07:42.171
I come here with respect.
He should do the same.

07:42.338 --> 07:44.590
Respect. Bravo.

07:44.757 --> 07:47.301
Respect... who gives a shit?
You sound like your father now.

07:47.468 --> 07:49.971
- Hey, Spiro.
- Now, Tommy, I understand him.

07:50.138 --> 07:52.682
<i>- I know what you're saying.
- Get your hands off him, okay?</i>

07:52.849 --> 07:55.601
What the hell are you doing?
What the hell is that?

07:55.768 --> 07:56.936
I'm sorry, okay?

07:57.103 --> 07:58.224
You don't need to touch him.

07:58.271 --> 08:00.398
Are you kidding me?
Is he kidding me right now?

08:00.565 --> 08:02.275
Okay, just... you don't
need to touch him.

08:02.441 --> 08:04.610
I just want to know, so you don't
want me to touch your father?

08:04.777 --> 08:06.737
- You don't need to fucking touch him.
- Spiro!

08:06.904 --> 08:08.781
- Get him outta here.
- Stop it, enough!

08:08.948 --> 08:10.950
- Who you want me to touch?
- Enough! Spiro!

08:11.117 --> 08:12.201
<i>- No, it's okay, it's okay.
- What are you doing?</i>

08:12.368 --> 08:13.953
I just want to know
who it is that I can touch.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.872
<i>Just calm down, take it easy.</i>

08:16.038 --> 08:18.416
It's okay, we're fine.
The kid's just excitable.

08:18.583 --> 08:20.418
He's all right.
It's okay, just got excited.

08:20.585 --> 08:22.295
<i>- He'll be okay.
- Go.</i>

08:22.461 --> 08:23.921
Go. I said go now.

08:24.088 --> 08:25.715
I said go! Go 90!

08:32.679 --> 08:34.347
Spiro, listen,
you're a powerful man.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.808
You gave me a job that I need,
but you don't speak with me

08:36.976 --> 08:38.977
like that in front
of my son again?

08:39.145 --> 08:41.272
Cr?

08:41.438 --> 08:43.857
Or you just don't.

08:45.568 --> 08:47.904
Let's hope it doesn't
come to that, okay, Tommy?

08:49.488 --> 08:53.075
We'll be fine, no problems.
That's kids, right? They're excitable.

09:10.676 --> 09:11.969
How you doing? Okay?

09:13.471 --> 09:15.389
Yeah, I'm all right.
Are you okay?

09:15.556 --> 09:17.850
Me? Yeah sure, fine. I'm fine.

09:19.852 --> 09:22.438
Yo, Vicky, put some clothes on.
What's wrong with you?

09:22.605 --> 09:24.690
- Hey.
- Shut up, just checking the mail.

09:24.857 --> 09:26.692
- Hey.
- Ma, you see what Vicky's wearing?

09:26.859 --> 09:28.736
- Mind your business.
- Shut your fucking face, Chris.

09:28.903 --> 09:30.696
Hey, Victoria,
watch your mouth.

09:30.863 --> 09:32.990
- Looks like a tramp dressed like that.
- Hey.

09:33.157 --> 09:35.409
Chris, don't talk to your sister
like that, come on.

09:35.576 --> 09:37.370
Vicky, go upstairs,
put on a dress or something nice.

09:37.536 --> 09:38.871
None of the girls wear
dresses any more, Daddy.

09:39.038 --> 09:41.290
I don't care if the other girls
dress like tramps.

09:41.457 --> 09:43.376
<i>- Thomasos, please.
- Gotta dress like a decent person.</i>

09:43.542 --> 09:45.044
<i>- It's too early for this.
- I want her to dress nice.</i>

09:45.211 --> 09:47.046
- Leave her alone. And you.
- She's got no clothes on, Mom.

09:47.213 --> 09:50.716
What'd I say?
I can't win. Unbelievable.

09:50.883 --> 09:52.969
In my own house.

09:55.763 --> 09:56.847
I know you hate working

09:57.014 --> 09:58.766
for those jerks at the club, Pop.

09:58.933 --> 10:00.977
It's okay. Everything's good.

10:02.228 --> 10:04.397
<i>- You gotta do what you gotta do.
- Yeah.</i>

10:04.563 --> 10:06.649
I know. But I want to help.

10:06.816 --> 10:08.776
You know?
And when I get this job with the police,

10:08.901 --> 10:11.021
I can put the whole family
on the insurance, you know?

10:11.112 --> 10:13.739
Yeah. My son the giant.

10:13.906 --> 10:15.658
Come on, Dad.
I'm being serious.

10:15.825 --> 10:18.995
You know, when I was
a policeman back in Greece,

10:19.161 --> 10:21.998
my first arrest was
a man beating a chicken.

10:22.164 --> 10:24.125
That's a true story.

10:24.292 --> 10:26.335
Made you feel good though, right?

10:26.502 --> 10:28.546
<i>- What, the chicken?
- Come on, I'm serious.</i>

10:28.713 --> 10:31.090
<i>- It made you feel good though, right?
- I felt good.</i>

10:31.257 --> 10:33.467
That's good.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.928
It's what I wanna do, you know?
I wanna be a cop.

10:36.095 --> 10:38.556
I wanna do what you did, Pop.

10:38.723 --> 10:42.601
- It's all I wanna do.
- Okay.

10:42.768 --> 10:46.522
You concentrate on that.
That's good. You'll get that.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.607
That's nice.
See, now you're wearing...

10:48.774 --> 10:50.443
some clothes. This is good.

10:50.609 --> 10:52.611
- Like a decent gir... young lady.
- Nothing!

10:52.778 --> 10:54.947
That's a beautiful shirt.

10:55.114 --> 10:56.699
<i>- Yeah.
- That's nice... Vicky!</i>

10:56.866 --> 10:58.367
Oh shit.

11:00.453 --> 11:02.654
- What is this?
- It must be the date to take the test.

11:02.788 --> 11:04.999
See, good things. This is good.

11:08.794 --> 11:10.671
You gotta be kidding me.

11:14.133 --> 11:16.135
Officer Potamitis,
when's the big test?

11:16.302 --> 11:18.304
- I don't know. Jerk-offs here?
- In the back.

11:18.471 --> 11:21.474
<i>- Smells like an open asshole back here.
- Hey, shut the fuck up, Eddie.</i>

11:21.640 --> 11:23.434
Maybe you should be
keeping your old job,

11:23.601 --> 11:25.144
if you don't like
how it smells here?

11:25.311 --> 11:27.063
It smells like dogshit.
What's up, bro?

11:27.229 --> 11:28.981
Yo, you see Mike's
new DeVille outside

11:29.148 --> 11:31.108
with the hydraulic system and shit?

11:31.275 --> 11:32.985
Stereo cassette? Fuck him.

11:33.152 --> 11:35.363
<i>- Yeah, it's a pussy magnet.
- A lot of pussy.</i>

11:35.529 --> 11:37.656
- I gotta talk with you.
- Me?

11:37.823 --> 11:39.784
- Come on.
- Hey, where'd you get that?

11:41.452 --> 11:43.162
Smith and Weston's.

11:43.329 --> 11:45.164
You gonna turn us in,
Officer Potamitis?

11:45.331 --> 11:48.376
Don't worry, we only use it
for Colombian insurance.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.703
Yeah, tell him the shit you got
with the Puerto Ricans.

11:50.711 --> 11:53.339
- There's... it's fucking... I'm serious.
- Colombians, okay?

11:53.506 --> 11:55.674
And when you have money,
Eddie, you're serious.

11:55.841 --> 11:58.052
Until then, here.
Have some more fries.

11:58.219 --> 11:59.678
Shit.

11:59.845 --> 12:01.680
- Time?
- Yeah, speaking of Colombians.

12:01.847 --> 12:03.349
We gotta go to Papagalo's.

12:03.516 --> 12:05.184
Oh yeah? Cool.

12:05.351 --> 12:06.769
All right, boys.

12:08.104 --> 12:09.605
See you boys later, all right?

12:15.903 --> 12:18.364
What? What, they got fries.

12:18.531 --> 12:20.366
Those assholes are
swimming in money, bro.

12:20.533 --> 12:23.654
Look at us looking for bullshit jobs...
you studying to become a cop. For what?

12:23.661 --> 12:25.222
I'm trying
to do something with my life.

12:25.246 --> 12:28.165
Now a waste of time
'cause you're a stupid shit.

12:28.332 --> 12:31.335
- What did I do?
- The fucking Black Sabbath concert.

12:31.502 --> 12:33.838
Now 'cause of that
I can't even apply to be a cop no more.

12:34.004 --> 12:36.382
Black Sabbath concert was
like a million years ago, bro.

12:36.549 --> 12:38.790
It stayed on my record.
I should fucking kill you for it.

12:38.884 --> 12:40.886
- It's a fucking joint, bro.
- You think I don't know that?

12:41.053 --> 12:42.388
Yo, that sucks, bro. I'm sorry.

12:42.555 --> 12:44.396
Let me take you to Papagalo's,
buy you a drink.

12:44.473 --> 12:47.226
- You ain't got no money.
- I got money, come on.

12:47.393 --> 12:48.727
I'm gonna go do a piss.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.355
- Yo, I'm sorry bro.
- Yeah.

12:51.522 --> 12:52.940
Honestly, that sucks, bro.

12:53.107 --> 12:55.901
- Come on, drinks on me.
- You ain't got no money.

12:57.236 --> 12:59.196
Call me later.

13:11.709 --> 13:13.294
The rain is miserable.

13:13.461 --> 13:15.212
Sorry I'm late, Mr. L.

13:17.173 --> 13:19.133
- Hey, Nance.
- Hey.

13:21.343 --> 13:24.430
I saw Vicky. She said you're not
taking the cop test no more?

13:24.597 --> 13:26.849
Because of Eddie?

13:27.016 --> 13:28.100
Yeah, you know.

13:28.267 --> 13:30.019
And my mother got
a thing for him, so.

13:30.186 --> 13:32.605
<i>- Yeah, he's an idiot.
- Yeah.</i>

13:32.771 --> 13:35.774
All right, well,
if you need anything,

13:35.941 --> 13:38.068
an umbrella or whatever, I'm here.

13:38.235 --> 13:40.571
Okay, thanks, Nance.

13:57.463 --> 13:59.507
All I can say is I've already
got a weapons permit.

13:59.673 --> 14:02.009
I can work nights, weekends,
whatever you want.

14:02.176 --> 14:05.137
I've been studying to be with the force
since I was old enough to read.

14:05.304 --> 14:07.973
Yeah, I'm sure the boss would
be real impressed with that.

14:09.308 --> 14:10.893
Look, my friend,
this ain't the NYPD.

14:11.060 --> 14:12.353
I hope you can understand that.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.396
Yeah yeah, I understand that.

14:14.563 --> 14:17.191
And are you okay
with the $200 a week?

14:18.484 --> 14:21.320
Yuh... I was making
50 a night working at a club.

14:21.487 --> 14:24.406
Well, you've already got a job!
How lucky are you?

14:24.573 --> 14:26.825
Hey, Mary, let's send
somebody else up here, okay?

14:26.992 --> 14:28.827
The club closed,
so I'll take it.

14:30.746 --> 14:32.414
I thought so.

14:32.581 --> 14:34.166
Okay then.

14:35.501 --> 14:37.169
Welcome aboard.

14:45.761 --> 14:48.097
Is it hot enough for you here?

14:48.264 --> 14:50.349
Frigging air conditioner
ain't working.

14:50.516 --> 14:52.768
They're gonna fix it. They keep
telling me they're gonna fix it,

14:52.935 --> 14:54.603
but who the hell knows?

14:55.980 --> 14:58.065
You keep playing with that thing,
you're gonna blow your balls off, man.

14:58.232 --> 15:00.067
Or worse... mine.

15:00.234 --> 15:02.152
Yeah, sorry. I just...

15:02.319 --> 15:04.989
You can't believe they gave you
a gun on your first day?

15:05.155 --> 15:07.491
Yeah, I mean I never even shot
anything before, you know?

15:07.658 --> 15:11.287
Just remember, the vest is
for your heart, not your balls, so.

15:13.706 --> 15:14.832
You're Chris, right?

15:14.999 --> 15:16.834
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's right, yeah yeah.

15:17.001 --> 15:19.336
I'm Tony.
Well, I told you that already.

15:19.503 --> 15:22.715
And this... Marie and Giana.

15:22.881 --> 15:25.050
That's my wife and little girl.

15:25.217 --> 15:28.887
They're the only thing keeping me
from driving this over the border.

15:30.598 --> 15:32.850
So anyways, we do about
eight to 10 pick-ups a day.

15:33.017 --> 15:35.227
Then we drive around and drop it off,

15:35.394 --> 15:36.937
drive some more, get some more,

15:37.104 --> 15:38.731
the owners take some off the top,

15:38.897 --> 15:41.066
and then Wednesday morning
we go back to the Reserve.

15:41.233 --> 15:44.194
Done. Beautiful. Brain surgery.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.322
Wait, the owners are taking money?

15:46.488 --> 15:48.240
Yeah well,
it's the bosses' rule,

15:48.407 --> 15:50.701
but hell, they can do whatever
the hell they want in here.

15:50.868 --> 15:52.953
A lot of monkey business
all I know is going on.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.581
Knowing too much will
drive you crazy, anyway.

15:55.748 --> 15:59.001
Just keep it simple, do your job,

15:59.168 --> 16:01.462
find a girl, buy a house. Okay.

16:01.629 --> 16:02.963
So this is how it goes.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.591
We pick the money up,
we lock it in the back here with you.

16:05.758 --> 16:07.468
<i>- Lock in the back.
- We're only talking</i>

16:07.635 --> 16:09.053
83 grand or so.

16:09.219 --> 16:12.222
That's it. One of these bags
can hold 250 easy.

16:12.389 --> 16:14.808
Biggest load I ever had
was six million.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.852
- It's crazy?
- Hey, you want to shut the...

16:17.019 --> 16:18.739
No no no, it's fine.
Just stay on your toes.

16:18.896 --> 16:20.616
You stay out here.
I'll be in and out quick.

16:20.773 --> 16:23.067
- Hey, Sal!
- Yeah yeah.

16:23.233 --> 16:24.652
Oh what, did you get a haircut?

16:25.861 --> 16:26.862
Hey, officer.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.489
Hey, kid.

16:28.656 --> 16:30.074
What, are you crazy?

16:30.240 --> 16:32.159
What the hell's the matter with you?

16:32.326 --> 16:34.119
Wait till I tell your father about this.

16:34.286 --> 16:36.789
- You could have gotten yourself killed.
- Hey, partner.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.556
Try and not let
somebody sneak up on you.

16:38.624 --> 16:40.959
- Yeah yeah. Sorry sorry.
- Yeah, all right.

16:41.126 --> 16:44.129
When we're hauling loot, you're gonna
be on shotgun duty back here.

16:44.296 --> 16:45.839
<i>- All right, back here.
- You got that?</i>

16:46.006 --> 16:47.299
- All right.
- All right, good.

16:47.466 --> 16:50.636
All right, so guard it like
it was your mother's 83 grand.

16:50.803 --> 16:53.138
- Want me to stay back here?
- Yeah, do what you want.

16:53.305 --> 16:55.724
- Okay.
- A lot of salami in those bags?

16:55.891 --> 16:58.102
- Yeah, no kidding.
- Trust me when I say

16:58.268 --> 17:00.312
I know what
you're thinking back there.

17:00.479 --> 17:01.647
Trust me, I do.

17:01.814 --> 17:04.191
Cash makes people
do some crazy shit.

17:04.358 --> 17:06.859
- You gotta keep your head about you.
- Okay.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.444
It's hot as hell back there, right?

17:08.612 --> 17:10.406
No shit.

17:12.074 --> 17:15.411
Yeah well,
you'll get used to it, buddy.

17:19.832 --> 17:22.041
Listen,
it's my daughter's birthday,

17:22.209 --> 17:24.044
so I gotta get out
of here early, okay?

17:24.211 --> 17:26.797
- Okay, sounds good.
- While they sort through the bags,

17:26.964 --> 17:28.173
do whatever the hell they do,

17:28.339 --> 17:29.800
I'll walk you through the process.

17:29.967 --> 17:32.094
Coming in!

17:32.261 --> 17:35.222
Wait, they're not gonna care that you're
leaving me alone to put away the money?

17:35.389 --> 17:37.975
Who, the boss?
A bunch of criminals up there.

17:38.142 --> 17:39.768
Don't worry yourself over it.

17:39.935 --> 17:41.687
We just do our thing up here.

17:41.854 --> 17:43.856
Okay,

17:44.022 --> 17:45.816
so the keys to the lock up

17:45.983 --> 17:48.610
- are kept right here.
- Whatever you say.

17:48.777 --> 17:50.154
Minimum wage.

17:51.947 --> 17:54.158
Come on,
I'll show you the good stuff.

17:55.576 --> 17:58.370
Anyway, this... this is okay?

17:59.747 --> 18:01.290
I don't know. Ask him.

18:01.457 --> 18:04.042
One, two, three, four.

18:04.209 --> 18:06.336
They're not very creative here.

18:06.503 --> 18:08.547
Yeah, no shit.

18:08.714 --> 18:10.174
And there it is.

18:11.216 --> 18:13.093
$25 million.

18:13.260 --> 18:16.597
- That's $25 million?
- Give or take a couple of 'em.

18:16.764 --> 18:18.557
Of a million?!

18:19.767 --> 18:21.101
Hey,

18:21.268 --> 18:23.103
Watch out.
There's a camera right there.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.355
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

18:25.522 --> 18:27.900
Okay, so after
they're done upstairs

18:28.066 --> 18:31.195
we drop it in here,
it piles up until it's full.

18:31.361 --> 18:34.072
Half the time the drivers
don't even bring it upstairs first.

18:34.239 --> 18:35.949
So how do they know
how much is in there?

18:36.116 --> 18:38.202
They don't.

18:38.368 --> 18:39.578
- They don't?
- No.

18:39.745 --> 18:41.997
- So if some goes missing...
- If some goes missing,

18:42.164 --> 18:44.041
it wouldn't be the first time
around here, pal.

18:44.208 --> 18:45.751
Oh hey hey!

18:45.918 --> 18:47.586
- Hey, come on.
- There's a dog in there?

18:47.753 --> 18:49.880
Yeah, there's a dog.
Come here, this is Barney.

18:50.047 --> 18:52.424
I forgot to...
he's deaf as a doornail,

18:52.591 --> 18:53.926
- the poor old guy.
- What, he lives in that?

18:54.092 --> 18:56.132
He lives in there with the money.
Come on, go ahead.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.055
- It's crazy. No shit.
- Go back to bed.

18:59.598 --> 19:01.517
Hey, that's Maria now. Come on.

19:01.683 --> 19:02.768
I gotta lock this up.

19:04.436 --> 19:07.940
Now remember, your partner here
came down with a severe head cold.

19:08.106 --> 19:09.274
- Got it.
- All right?

19:09.441 --> 19:11.401
- Yeah.
- You gotta get my back on this one.

19:13.070 --> 19:15.906
- You got it.
- Put those keys back behind the desk.

19:16.073 --> 19:18.617
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

19:20.869 --> 19:22.746
Fucking dog.

19:41.431 --> 19:43.976
Boy, what, are you taking
a night off, Pop?

19:44.142 --> 19:45.978
Hey.

19:46.979 --> 19:49.064
No, I was just taking
a little break.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.775
Well, good for you.

19:53.485 --> 19:56.321
<i>- What's going on here?
- They let your father go.</i>

19:56.488 --> 19:59.783
- What?
- After 10 years, no warning.

19:59.950 --> 20:02.160
- Enough, dear. Enough, dear.
- Nice people?

20:02.327 --> 20:04.687
What, because of that thing
in the bathroom the other night?

20:04.705 --> 20:06.999
- Of course that's why.
- It's fine, really, enough.

20:07.165 --> 20:09.126
- That's it.
- No no, it's not fine.

20:09.293 --> 20:11.670
- He had no right.
- He's the boss, he has the right.

20:11.837 --> 20:14.673
No. Why? Because you stood up
to that jerk-off, that's why?

20:14.840 --> 20:17.009
Of course that's why.
The bunch of hoodlums

20:17.175 --> 20:19.303
- living their lives like criminals.
- Enough.

20:19.469 --> 20:21.847
<i>- Enough, both of you.
- No, that's not enough!</i>

20:22.014 --> 20:23.454
You've been there 10 years and what?

20:23.515 --> 20:24.933
He's just gonna say,
"That's it, no more"?

20:25.100 --> 20:26.780
That's exactly what they're gonna say.

20:26.894 --> 20:28.478
And they can and they did.

20:29.521 --> 20:31.440
And that's all.

20:36.028 --> 20:38.071
10 years my father's
working for these people.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.032
And what has he got
to show for it? Nothing.

20:40.198 --> 20:41.658
No retirement, no insurance.

20:41.825 --> 20:44.202
You know what?
I worry about that stuff, you know?

20:44.369 --> 20:46.747
Yeah well,
we all worry about that, kid.

20:46.914 --> 20:49.458
What are you gonna do?
Come on, let's get to work.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.383
Your date was good?

20:58.550 --> 21:00.552
It's the circus.
What are you gonna do?

21:03.555 --> 21:06.141
Giana loved it.
There were clowns and things.

21:06.308 --> 21:08.644
You know, they had a unicorn
and some craziness.

21:08.810 --> 21:10.354
<i>- You know?
- Oh yeah?</i>

21:10.520 --> 21:12.356
Hey, so what's the deal at Empire?

21:12.522 --> 21:14.691
You know,
far as insurance or retirement?

21:14.858 --> 21:18.236
Again with the retirement? You're
too young to worry about retirement.

21:18.403 --> 21:20.614
Especially with those hoodlums,
believe me.

21:20.781 --> 21:22.532
You keep saying that.
What's the deal?

21:22.699 --> 21:24.910
They're crooked, right?
Always in that room?

21:25.077 --> 21:27.871
Yeah. They ain't playing
Tiddlywinks in there, pal.

21:28.038 --> 21:29.790
You just wait out here, okay?

21:29.957 --> 21:32.042
You're like that cartoon thing...
you worry too much.

21:33.043 --> 21:34.836
Hey, guys, how you doing?

21:45.973 --> 21:48.725
Trust me, from here out
you'll be doing the heavy lifting,

21:48.892 --> 21:51.103
I guarantee you that.
They don't pay me enough to do...

21:54.606 --> 21:55.774
Get your hands up!

21:55.941 --> 21:57.693
It's okay,

21:58.777 --> 22:00.570
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

22:00.737 --> 22:02.447
Shut the fuck up!

22:02.614 --> 22:04.408
Come on, come here,
you motherfucker!

22:04.574 --> 22:07.953
- Motherfucker, motherfucker!
- I'll kill you, no!

22:08.120 --> 22:09.871
Get the fuck...

22:12.624 --> 22:14.251
No no, hey!

22:15.460 --> 22:17.462
No!

22:17.629 --> 22:19.256
Yo yo, hey!

22:21.967 --> 22:24.428
Marie...

22:25.470 --> 22:27.472
Get the fuck outta here.
Let's go!

22:28.473 --> 22:29.975
Fuck the money!

22:33.228 --> 22:34.771
Let's get the fuck outta here.

22:40.610 --> 22:42.654
Kid's lucky
he was wearing a vest.

22:42.821 --> 22:44.489
If not, game over.

22:44.656 --> 22:47.325
<i>- No doubt.
- The kid's named Potami or something.</i>

22:47.492 --> 22:49.703
He's right over there.

22:52.247 --> 22:54.416
I'm gonna go talk to him.

23:04.176 --> 23:06.470
Mr. "Potami."

23:06.636 --> 23:08.722
I'm Jerry Ransone, cop...

23:08.889 --> 23:10.849
detective, you know.

23:12.434 --> 23:14.144
Is he dead?

23:18.648 --> 23:21.651
Yeah. High probability.

23:22.986 --> 23:24.529
Listen, Mr. Potami...

23:24.696 --> 23:27.866
hey hey.

23:28.033 --> 23:29.534
Easy, okay?

23:30.786 --> 23:32.871
Listen, if you had anything to do

23:33.038 --> 23:35.624
with this whole whatever-just-
went-down... listen to me,

23:35.791 --> 23:38.794
now's a better time than later
if you want to shoot straight with me.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.796
I'm giving you a chance.

23:41.963 --> 23:44.216
Sound fair to you?

23:44.382 --> 23:46.176
Listen, I'm not gonna
waste your time,

23:46.343 --> 23:48.178
I don't want you to waste my time.
I got a life too.

23:48.345 --> 23:50.639
- I got a lot of shit to do, okay?
- I already told the other cops.

23:50.806 --> 23:52.808
Okay? I had nothing
to do with this.

23:54.101 --> 23:56.311
He's a good guy.
I liked him. He had a family.

23:59.231 --> 24:00.982
Fucking break already, okay?

24:05.278 --> 24:07.155
It's all right.
The kid's clean.

24:09.241 --> 24:10.575
What?

24:10.742 --> 24:13.078
He's clean.
The kid's clean. Let him go.

24:29.302 --> 24:31.596
All right, I'm gonna go.
My motherjust wanted me

24:31.763 --> 24:33.557
to stop by,
make sure you were alive.

24:33.723 --> 24:35.851
- You should stay.
- I'm still here.

24:36.017 --> 24:37.519
You Okay?

24:37.686 --> 24:39.187
Yeah, I... you know.

24:39.354 --> 24:42.107
Feels like I got kicked
in the ribs or something.

24:42.274 --> 24:43.942
Yeah, except it was a gun.

24:44.109 --> 24:46.278
Yeah, thank God
for that gun-protector thing.

24:46.444 --> 24:47.863
All right, I'm gonna go.

24:48.029 --> 24:50.240
- No, don't.
- Don't you want to eat?

24:50.407 --> 24:53.160
- Sit down, eat something.
- I've gotta go to work.

24:53.326 --> 24:55.787
I'll see you guys later.
Glad you're okay, Chris.

24:55.954 --> 24:58.331
<i>- Thanks, Nance.
- Good night.</i>

24:59.624 --> 25:01.585
<i>- She's a good girl.
- Yeah.</i>

25:01.751 --> 25:04.296
- Very nice girl. I like her.
- Like a sister that I like.

25:04.462 --> 25:05.797
- Shut up.
- Hey.

25:05.964 --> 25:07.765
The main thing is
that you're safe, thank God.

25:07.924 --> 25:09.684
- That's the main thing.
- And your partner?

25:09.843 --> 25:11.761
The job will take care
for his family?

25:11.928 --> 25:15.473
- That's what they said.
- Then that's what they'll do, right?

25:15.640 --> 25:17.517
That's what they said.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.144
Good.

25:19.311 --> 25:20.770
Oh hey!

25:20.937 --> 25:22.147
Fucking-a, malaka.

25:22.314 --> 25:24.155
I thought your dad was
the man of steel, right?

25:24.316 --> 25:26.477
- With the mouth.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse my language.

25:26.568 --> 25:28.153
What happened?
I mean a fucking bomb?!

25:28.320 --> 25:30.655
<i>- His friend was just killed, Eddie.
- I know, that sucks.</i>

25:30.822 --> 25:33.366
- Are you kidding? I mean...
- None of this would have happened

25:33.533 --> 25:35.994
if it wasn't for that thing
with you smoking pot and all that.

25:36.161 --> 25:37.801
- In the Led Zeppelin show.
- No, I know.

25:37.829 --> 25:40.165
- Chris would be a police officer now.
- I know, I feel terrible.

25:40.332 --> 25:42.167
Yeah, you're talking about
Black Sabbath, by the way.

25:42.334 --> 25:44.085
Trust me,
I wish we saw Zeppelin.

25:46.671 --> 25:48.173
What the fuck happened, bro?

25:48.340 --> 25:50.425
I'm gonna go.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.677
<i>- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go lay down or something.</i>

25:52.844 --> 25:55.680
Going to lay down?
Why would everybody...

25:55.847 --> 25:58.016
everybody leaves when I show up?

26:00.477 --> 26:02.771
Yo, what channel's cable?

26:05.232 --> 26:07.692
A botched attempt
at an armored-car robbery

26:07.859 --> 26:10.028
left one man dead
and a slew of questions,

26:10.195 --> 26:12.447
as a pipe bomb was detonated
in broad daylight

26:12.614 --> 26:15.033
at 125th and Lennox Avenue
in Manhattan.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.744
Police are investigating
the robbery as two suspects,

26:17.911 --> 26:19.746
both wearing masks, fled the scene

26:19.913 --> 26:22.040
in what's being described
as a blue van.

26:58.576 --> 27:00.287
Potamis!

27:06.960 --> 27:10.755
- Yeah?
- So you'll be working nights here now.

27:10.922 --> 27:12.549
What? Why?

27:12.716 --> 27:14.634
We give our guys
on the streets guns

27:14.801 --> 27:17.012
to shoot people
who show up with other guns.

27:17.178 --> 27:20.056
I had Tony's back, okay?

27:20.223 --> 27:23.310
Great. So you'll be
working nights now.

27:25.854 --> 27:27.439
You can go.

28:15.987 --> 28:17.030
There he is.

28:17.197 --> 28:19.324
Dirty Harry-

28:19.491 --> 28:21.368
Yeah, good job with that.

28:21.534 --> 28:24.996
Aren't you supposed to bring
the money inside at night?

28:26.081 --> 28:27.540
I don't know, are we?

28:27.707 --> 28:30.001
<i>- I'm just asking.
- So are we.</i>

28:31.044 --> 28:32.545
The money will be fine out there.

28:32.712 --> 28:36.007
Exactly. Just keep an eye
on the monitors and we'll all be fine.

28:36.174 --> 28:37.467
Got that?

28:37.634 --> 28:39.010
Good.

28:39.177 --> 28:40.678
Let's go.

28:42.013 --> 28:43.848
The bosses don't give a shit.
Why should we?

28:44.015 --> 28:45.892
Exactly. Fuck that.
I got kids at home.

30:28.453 --> 30:30.330
The fuckers are giving
Tony's wife 5,000

30:30.497 --> 30:32.957
instead of 50. I know
they're stealing it, trust me.

30:33.124 --> 30:35.084
- What, the owners are?
- Fuck yeah, the owners.

30:35.251 --> 30:36.461
Everybody's up to shit in there.
Everybody.

30:36.628 --> 30:38.588
Yeah, everyone except you, bro.

30:38.755 --> 30:41.049
Yeah well, the place is a joke.

30:41.216 --> 30:43.843
Let's cross. Fucking...
I don't want to deal with those guys.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.346
<i>- Let's cross.
- What, your father working today?</i>

30:46.513 --> 30:48.598
- No, he...
- What?

30:48.765 --> 30:50.517
- They let him go.
- What?

30:50.683 --> 30:52.352
After 10 years
they fucking let him go.

30:52.519 --> 30:54.812
<i>- Fucking assholes.
- That's it, no more. Fucking...</i>

30:54.979 --> 30:57.065
Thinking they're big shits
in their Cadillacs, right?

30:57.232 --> 30:58.900
- Fucking big shots.
- Excuse me?

30:59.067 --> 31:01.861
I'm just saying you fire this guy's
fucking father after 10 years?

31:02.028 --> 31:03.668
Sorry, I'm not sure
I'm hearing you right.

31:03.780 --> 31:04.989
I think the least
you could do is be a little loyal.

31:05.156 --> 31:06.157
Let's go.

31:06.324 --> 31:08.535
- I don't know what you're saying.
- Fucking big shots

31:08.701 --> 31:10.101
in their Cadillacs, right?
Big shit.

31:10.245 --> 31:13.081
<i>- I take the trains, yo.
- Asshole.</i>

31:20.505 --> 31:22.706
You know what? You should rob
that place where you work.

31:23.883 --> 31:25.843
You say the place
ain't got no security, so.

31:26.010 --> 31:27.512
Yeah, you're right. I should.

31:27.679 --> 31:30.181
Yeah, I am right! What,
you don't think they'll screw it over?

31:30.348 --> 31:32.350
They screwed your friend over.
Look at him.

31:32.517 --> 31:34.394
Fucking widow.

31:34.561 --> 31:37.313
Think about that.
Think about his kids, bro.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.732
Yeah, I should rob them.

31:39.899 --> 31:41.693
Yeah, you should.

31:46.114 --> 31:48.408
We'll fix them, right? Yeah.

31:55.832 --> 31:57.625
Fuck.

33:02.148 --> 33:03.149
Shit.

33:19.123 --> 33:21.125
This is Chris. Code 18249.

33:21.292 --> 33:23.961
Yo, this is Honeywell.
Got a reading the gate's open there?

33:25.880 --> 33:27.382
Yeah, I don't know. The...

33:27.548 --> 33:30.009
the light was blinking,
but it looks good now.

33:30.176 --> 33:32.512
All right. Cops say we get
a signal, we've gotta call.

33:32.679 --> 33:34.514
No worries.
Call if there's a problem.

33:34.681 --> 33:35.890
- Okay.
- All right.

34:37.577 --> 34:39.203
All right, bro, just let me...

34:39.370 --> 34:41.330
<i>- show it to me one more time.
- Just keep your fucking voice down.</i>

34:41.496 --> 34:43.166
<i>- Let me see one more.
- Cut the shit, all right?</i>

34:43.331 --> 34:45.251
Holy shit! And they won't know?

34:45.418 --> 34:46.938
They don't even
count it half the time.

34:47.043 --> 34:48.463
Jesus, holy shit.

34:48.629 --> 34:51.924
The camera doesn't even see the door
when it opens. The place is a joke.

34:52.091 --> 34:53.509
- Like I even want to fucking take it.
- You know, fuck it, right?

34:53.676 --> 34:55.877
Do you understand?
You gotta get me a job at this place.

34:55.887 --> 34:57.680
Do you know what I could
do with $25,000?

34:57.847 --> 34:59.640
I could pay for my fucking wedding,
my fucking car.

34:59.807 --> 35:01.893
Keep your fucking mouth down.
Calm down, okay?

35:02.059 --> 35:03.728
Trust me,
I did this for a reason.

35:03.895 --> 35:06.063
<i>- Yeah, to take the money!
- No, it's just fucked up,</i>

35:06.230 --> 35:08.550
what they did to Tony's family.
The guy had a fucking wife,

35:08.691 --> 35:11.277
- a little girl.
- Yeah listen, I feel terrible too,

35:11.444 --> 35:13.905
but you know what?
Can we go out and party already?

35:17.950 --> 35:20.077
<i>- All right, yeah. Fuck it.
- Thank you. Jesus.</i>

35:20.244 --> 35:23.122
<i>- Have a bit of fun every once...
- I gotta make one stop before we go.</i>

35:24.916 --> 35:26.667
Hey, let's go.
Get your fucking eye...

35:26.834 --> 35:28.085
- Why?
- Let's fucking go!

35:28.252 --> 35:29.587
Why, you leaving $100?

35:38.513 --> 35:40.348
Why are you stopping?

35:46.229 --> 35:48.231
I don't wanna be a dick, but really?

35:49.732 --> 35:51.150
Really.

36:11.587 --> 36:13.881
- Mrs. Cappolitti?
- Yes.

36:15.299 --> 36:16.968
I...

36:17.134 --> 36:18.928
I was a good friend of Tony's.

36:20.263 --> 36:22.139
I wanted to give this to you.

36:22.306 --> 36:24.267
<i>- Excuse me?
- Please just take it.</i>

36:25.977 --> 36:27.687
I'm really sorry.

36:43.619 --> 36:45.830
We, good to go now?

36:47.039 --> 36:48.666
Yeah, let's do it.

37:00.303 --> 37:01.304
All right!

37:01.470 --> 37:03.639
In my dreams...

37:03.806 --> 37:06.767
This place reeks of Aqua Net.

37:10.187 --> 37:12.189
Hey, right here.
This is our spot right here.

37:12.356 --> 37:14.400
- All right.
- Can we get four kamikazes

37:14.567 --> 37:16.861
and a bottle of your most
expensive champagne, all right?

37:17.028 --> 37:19.530
- And a round of Long Island ice teas.
- I want a white Russian, Eddie.

37:19.697 --> 37:22.158
- A white Russian for the beauty queen.
- Everyone should chill tonight.

37:22.325 --> 37:23.409
<i>- Just chill.
- Just do it!</i>

37:23.576 --> 37:25.036
And where the fuck
did you get all this money?

37:25.202 --> 37:27.538
Chris stole it from the money place.

37:27.705 --> 37:30.166
Relax, bro. Everybody knows
I'm just fucking around.

37:30.333 --> 37:32.293
Come on, who thinks
you stole from where you work?

37:32.418 --> 37:33.658
- Shit, I need smokes.
- Right?

37:33.753 --> 37:35.129
<i>- Let's go to the bar.
- Where are you going?</i>

37:35.296 --> 37:37.298
<i>- I'm going to get cigarettes.
- Get me some, all right?</i>

37:37.465 --> 37:39.759
- Fuck you, Eddie, get your own.
- You smoke all my cigarettes.

37:39.926 --> 37:41.469
Fuck off.

37:43.179 --> 37:45.389
Yo, this place is the shit
when you got cash, right?

37:45.556 --> 37:48.559
You know, you really gotta learn to keep
your mouth shut, you know that?

37:50.811 --> 37:52.772
- It is a lot of cash though, right?
- Fuck yeah, it is!

37:52.939 --> 37:54.699
- A lot of fucking cash.
- Fuck yeah, it is.

37:55.816 --> 37:58.069
Yo, look who it is, bro.
Mike and Jimmy, look at them.

37:58.235 --> 38:01.197
Yeah, big shots in the bullshit room
thinking who they are, right?

38:01.364 --> 38:02.865
<i>- Couple of jerk-offs.
- Who are they with?</i>

38:03.032 --> 38:05.313
Puerto Ricans from Jackson Heights.
Thank you, sweetheart.

38:05.409 --> 38:07.578
<i>- I know what that is, right?
- Puerto Ricans?</i>

38:07.745 --> 38:09.872
Coke. Gonna say what's up.

38:10.039 --> 38:11.916
Yo, where are you going?

38:12.083 --> 38:13.626
Where are you going?

38:13.793 --> 38:15.753
- Yo, it's VIP only.
- Yeah, exactly.

38:15.920 --> 38:17.672
Whatever you guys need too,
just talk to me, Jimmy.

38:17.838 --> 38:19.131
<i>We'll take care of you.</i>

38:19.298 --> 38:20.883
Big shit, nice!

38:21.050 --> 38:23.386
You can see the whole
fucking room from this place.

38:23.552 --> 38:25.513
- Look, I can see Chris!
- What the fuck you doing here, Eddie?

38:25.680 --> 38:27.765
What, I'm just here, bro.
I'm just hanging out.

38:27.932 --> 38:30.059
Â¢'.QuÃ© pasa, amigo?
HÂ°W are YOU guys doing?

38:30.226 --> 38:31.978
- Okay?
- We were discussing business,

38:32.144 --> 38:34.772
<i>- you know. So can you go, please?
- Yeah yeah yeah, what?</i>

38:34.939 --> 38:36.232
What? I'm not a businessman?

38:36.399 --> 38:38.609
I don't look
like I can conduct business myself?

38:38.776 --> 38:41.320
What? I'm all business, bro.

38:41.487 --> 38:42.887
That's what I am.
I'm here to party.

38:42.905 --> 38:44.365
Are you guys here to party,
you know what I mean?

38:44.532 --> 38:46.212
I got the champagne,
you guys got the coke.

38:46.242 --> 38:48.119
Come on, let's make a deal.
What do you want me to do?

38:48.285 --> 38:51.247
Right? These are the guys you were
telling me about at the diner.

38:51.414 --> 38:53.249
- The Puerto Ricans, right?
- Colombians.

38:53.416 --> 38:55.042
- Who?
- Syrians.

38:55.209 --> 38:57.294
You fucking have
a funny guy here?

38:59.296 --> 39:01.173
Who? What'd you say?

39:01.340 --> 39:04.468
I said you think you're
the funny guy here?

39:04.635 --> 39:06.178
All my... I'm the funny guy?

39:06.345 --> 39:08.865
I'm sorry, bro. I can't understand
a fucking word you're saying.

39:08.931 --> 39:10.808
Holy shit.
Yo, you actually talk like that?

39:10.975 --> 39:12.655
<i>- Like for real?
- Eddie, Eddie, come here.</i>

39:12.685 --> 39:14.311
<i>- Somebody tell me who this idiot is.
- Shut up, come here.</i>

39:14.478 --> 39:16.731
- I like this funny guy.
- Thank you.

39:16.897 --> 39:18.274
Eddie! Come here.

39:18.441 --> 39:19.984
<i>- What?
- C'mere, here.</i>

39:20.151 --> 39:22.069
<i>- You can pay me later.
- Oh, come on!</i>

39:22.236 --> 39:24.196
I'm not that kind of...
who do you think I am?

39:24.363 --> 39:25.614
Come on, bro. This guy.

39:25.781 --> 39:27.382
He thinks he can fucking
just pay me off.

39:27.533 --> 39:28.993
- You want the champagne?
- Just go.

39:29.160 --> 39:30.828
Here.
Enjoy that, guys, all right?

39:30.995 --> 39:31.996
- Thank you.
- All right,

39:32.163 --> 39:33.664
I'm gonna go take care of this.
You know what I mean?

39:33.831 --> 39:34.952
- I'll be right back.
- Yep.

39:34.999 --> 39:37.418
Fucking room... fancy shit.

39:40.046 --> 39:42.298
<i>- The guy's an idiot, you know?
- Retarded.</i>

39:42.465 --> 39:45.176
Since when do these jerk-offs
have so much money?

39:46.343 --> 39:48.220
I was just thinking
the same exact shit.

39:49.722 --> 39:51.390
Chateau de Shit.

39:51.557 --> 39:53.718
Asshole blows enough lines,
he'll be talking all night.

39:53.768 --> 39:54.769
All right!

40:02.234 --> 40:04.653
There's like $25,000 in each bag.

40:04.820 --> 40:07.239
And each bag is locked
behind this fucking gate.

40:07.406 --> 40:09.033
The camera doesn't even look,

40:09.200 --> 40:11.327
and he's the only fucking security guy
in the whole place at night.

40:11.494 --> 40:13.162
Yeah.

40:15.164 --> 40:16.874
- Where the fuck were you?
- Chris.

40:17.041 --> 40:20.669
You know, Eddie was just
telling us about the 25Gs.

40:20.836 --> 40:23.089
That true you're
the only guy there at night?

40:23.255 --> 40:25.049
We were just talking, bro.

40:25.216 --> 40:27.885
Yeah, so, you know,
I'm just curious,

40:28.052 --> 40:31.180
you know, how can... how can you take
that much and they don't know nothing?

40:31.347 --> 40:32.973
Tell them how they leave

40:33.140 --> 40:34.266
the truck outside overnight
with the fucking money in it.

40:34.433 --> 40:37.561
<i>- Enough, Eddie, okay?
- Tell them that.</i>

40:37.728 --> 40:39.438
Whatever you guys
are thinking, forget it.

40:39.605 --> 40:41.774
Guys, he doesn't know
what he's talking about.

40:44.193 --> 40:47.738
- Chris, it's... it's a simple 1-2-3...
- Enough, okay? Enough.

40:51.909 --> 40:54.078
Eddie, why would you say
anything to those people?

40:54.245 --> 40:56.163
I mean, it's like
you're retarded. Mike...

40:56.330 --> 40:58.040
I mean, he's a maniac,
you know that.

40:58.207 --> 40:59.834
We were just talking, bro, relax.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.044
You already said that.

41:02.211 --> 41:03.963
Besides the fact,
they work for Spiro!

41:04.130 --> 41:06.423
Fuck Spiro.
They don't give a shit about Spiro,

41:06.590 --> 41:08.509
nobody does.
You know you didn't tell me

41:08.676 --> 41:10.957
that they leave the truck
outside overnight for no reason.

41:11.095 --> 41:13.013
You know you wanted me
to put it in action, bro.

41:13.180 --> 41:16.559
Put what into action?
Listen, you idiot,

41:16.725 --> 41:19.186
get whatever stupid idea is
in your head out of your head.

41:19.353 --> 41:22.034
Seriously, let me ask you, what's
the worst that could happen, what?

41:22.106 --> 41:24.984
What did Georgie get that
one time for auto theft, a year?

41:25.151 --> 41:27.278
And a year ain't worth
a chance at a million dollars?

41:27.444 --> 41:29.446
We're not talking about
robbing a car, Eddie.

41:29.613 --> 41:31.740
I'm not cleaning lambjizz
the rest of my life, bro.

41:31.907 --> 41:33.951
My father died when he was 42.

41:34.118 --> 41:36.328
Your father... no offense,
but he just got canned

41:36.495 --> 41:38.535
- for cleaning Spiro's toilets.
- Watch your mouth.

41:38.664 --> 41:39.745
All right, I'm sorry. Look,

41:39.832 --> 41:41.876
all I'm saying is think about it, okay?

41:42.042 --> 41:44.461
Just think about it when you go
to your house tonight, okay?

41:44.628 --> 41:47.631
Worst-case scenario, I go to jail
for robbing a fucking truck,

41:47.798 --> 41:49.967
you know, for a year.

41:50.134 --> 41:51.719
Anything else, we're set.

41:52.928 --> 41:54.305
We're set.

41:54.471 --> 41:55.973
Fucking think about it.

41:58.392 --> 41:59.810
We're set, bro.

42:57.159 --> 42:59.912
Hamilton Bohannon, 1978.

43:00.079 --> 43:02.498
Have a great night, New York.

43:02.665 --> 43:04.083
Look at you, buddy.

43:05.584 --> 43:08.003
Sitting in there with $25 million.

43:10.547 --> 43:13.133
That's a lot of money.

43:44.206 --> 43:47.376
Okay, Eddie, the diner, tonight.

43:50.671 --> 43:54.091
Look, Chris, I just gotta know that
this asshole can keep his mouth shut.

43:54.258 --> 43:56.093
Okay?
If Spiro finds out, we're dead,

43:56.260 --> 43:58.095
<i>- me and Jimmy.
- Why, you don't trust me?</i>

43:58.262 --> 43:59.513
No!

43:59.680 --> 44:01.515
Listen, no more bullshitting, okay?

44:01.682 --> 44:03.434
This is serious.
And Mike's right.

44:03.600 --> 44:05.936
Nobody but us knows anything
about anything, okay?

44:12.109 --> 44:13.777
What's his problem?

44:16.905 --> 44:19.241
I just... I just think

44:19.408 --> 44:22.161
if we're going to do this,
we should let Spiro in on it, no?

44:22.328 --> 44:24.371
You tell Spiro, he'll want it all.

44:24.538 --> 44:26.790
Yeah, but we don't have
to give it to him all.

44:26.957 --> 44:28.417
See what I'm saying?

44:29.460 --> 44:31.086
Eddie's right.

44:31.253 --> 44:33.088
He's trÃ©los, but he's right.

44:33.255 --> 44:34.965
Spiro can't know nothing.

44:35.132 --> 44:37.718
What, you don't think
he's gonna find out?

44:37.885 --> 44:38.927
No, I don't.

44:40.137 --> 44:41.305
Okay.

44:42.514 --> 44:44.391
Okay, Jimmy.

44:44.558 --> 44:47.227
I'm serious. We're serious.

44:48.312 --> 44:50.147
Are you good with that?

44:52.107 --> 44:53.984
Hey.

44:54.151 --> 44:56.320
He's asking you a question.

44:59.573 --> 45:01.033
I'm out.

45:01.200 --> 45:02.618
- Fuck it.
- You're out.

45:02.785 --> 45:05.120
You don't need me for this.
You got two guys anyway.

45:05.287 --> 45:08.082
I was going to do construction
at the movie theater this weekend.

45:08.248 --> 45:10.501
All right? I'm gonna go.

45:17.508 --> 45:20.052
Look, I'm still in
for the Colombian deal.

45:20.219 --> 45:21.762
All right?
However that goes down,

45:21.929 --> 45:23.138
but this...

45:23.305 --> 45:25.099
it's... no.

45:25.265 --> 45:26.683
No, I'm gonna go.

45:26.850 --> 45:28.143
<i>- You sure?
- Yeah.</i>

45:30.270 --> 45:32.314
Fuck him.
More money for me then, right?

45:33.399 --> 45:34.983
Okay.

45:35.150 --> 45:36.527
Don't worry, all right, Chris?

45:36.693 --> 45:38.946
Don't worry.
He knows I'd kill him.

45:39.988 --> 45:40.989
We're good.

45:41.156 --> 45:42.908
Right.

45:44.576 --> 45:46.078
Okay okay.

45:49.873 --> 45:52.084
Okay, this...

45:52.251 --> 45:53.752
is Empire.

46:04.513 --> 46:07.391
Okay, Thursday night
I'll be the only one there.

46:09.726 --> 46:12.062
Eddie, off Boston Road
there'll be a fence.

46:13.564 --> 46:15.365
At the top of the fence,
there'll be a camera.

46:16.233 --> 46:17.359
I want you to break it.

46:20.237 --> 46:21.947
The next night... Friday night...

46:22.114 --> 46:24.616
- the guards will be out by 8:00.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

46:26.702 --> 46:29.580
Nobody gets overtime, so believe me,
they'll be out like clockwork.

46:33.250 --> 46:35.043
8:00 sharp.

46:35.210 --> 46:38.005
There's a phone booth
two blocks away on Jerome Avenue.

46:38.172 --> 46:40.424
You and Mike will go there
and you'll wait.

46:42.426 --> 46:44.845
I'll go inside,
so I'll make sure everything's cool.

46:45.012 --> 46:47.806
But I'm serious,
you stay out there and you'll wait.

46:49.475 --> 46:52.186
And nothing happens until I call you.

46:54.271 --> 46:56.523
Nothing... until I call.

47:02.905 --> 47:03.906
Hey, hey!

47:04.072 --> 47:07.117
He's okay, he's okay, he's okay,
he's okay. Anyone else here?

47:08.285 --> 47:10.370
- Is anyone here?!
- What? No.

47:11.830 --> 47:14.500
- All right.
- What's going on?

47:14.666 --> 47:17.794
We got a tip a crew's coming in here.
You know anything about it?

47:17.961 --> 47:19.601
- Do you know anything about it?
- No no.

47:19.755 --> 47:22.382
All right, get up on the roof.
Staircase's right there.

47:22.549 --> 47:24.760
Secure that door.
Check the perimeter.

47:32.267 --> 47:33.977
Everyone, move!

47:44.363 --> 47:46.949
I've been upstairs,
downstairs, all over the place.

47:47.115 --> 47:48.367
Nothing in here.

47:48.534 --> 47:50.327
Camera look like it's out of order,

47:50.494 --> 47:52.246
but hey, what you gonna do?

47:53.497 --> 47:55.749
Other than that,
not a mice stirring.

47:57.834 --> 48:00.587
Do you have any idea how many
violations are going on in this place?

48:00.754 --> 48:01.838
- It's crazy.
- Yeah yeah,

48:02.005 --> 48:03.507
it's about as secure
as a candy shop.

48:03.674 --> 48:06.635
- Hey, it's only money, right?
- Yeah, exactly.

48:08.387 --> 48:11.181
All right, I'll take one
last look around the premises.

48:11.348 --> 48:13.225
- Just holler.
- For sure.

48:15.477 --> 48:17.729
Mind if I do a few sets
on your thing over there?

48:17.896 --> 48:20.274
You know, knock yourself out.

48:21.358 --> 48:22.901
'Cause it's Nautilus by the gym

48:23.068 --> 48:24.820
over by my place.

48:26.280 --> 48:27.447
You know what they say?

48:27.614 --> 48:29.199
Dead weight,
that's the only way

48:29.366 --> 48:31.368
to really get
that size on, you know?

48:31.535 --> 48:33.078
Gotta feel that burn.

48:33.245 --> 48:35.414
<i>- Yeah.
- Little hard work,</i>

48:35.581 --> 48:36.873
no big shirts.

48:37.040 --> 48:38.667
You know how it is.

48:47.551 --> 48:49.011
Yo?

48:49.177 --> 48:50.178
The fucking cops are here,
you hear me?

48:50.345 --> 48:51.888
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Fucking cops...

48:52.055 --> 48:53.935
- they're already inside and I fucking...
- Yo!

48:55.434 --> 48:58.562
Hey hey hey,
what was that there?

49:04.276 --> 49:05.736
- That?
- Yeah, what was that?

49:05.902 --> 49:08.238
Naw, I was just...

49:08.405 --> 49:10.532
you know,
I was talking to my mother.

49:10.699 --> 49:12.367
<i>- That was your mother?
- No, she was...</i>

49:12.534 --> 49:14.286
I don't know, she was doing
some cooking or something.

49:14.453 --> 49:16.705
- I'm gonna go use the bathroom, okay?
- Yeah, it's right down there.

49:16.872 --> 49:17.873
You sure you don't
want to call her back?

49:18.040 --> 49:19.166
No no, that's okay.

49:19.333 --> 49:20.834
That's what I'm talking about.

49:21.001 --> 49:23.420
I think we got
something out here, boss.

49:23.587 --> 49:24.880
Roger that. On the move.

49:25.047 --> 49:26.673
Let's roll.
Enough with the weights.

49:26.840 --> 49:29.384
<i>- Everyone move!
- Let's go. Move!</i>

49:29.551 --> 49:31.386
Fuck.

49:31.553 --> 49:33.805
How are things going out there?
Come on, talk to me.

49:33.972 --> 49:36.433
Two perps,
both armed, masks on.

49:36.600 --> 49:38.894
<i>- One just slipped the fence.
- Anyone else?</i>

49:39.061 --> 49:40.812
Negative.

49:40.979 --> 49:42.606
Roger that.

49:42.773 --> 49:44.441
<i>- You ready?
- Ready.</i>

49:46.485 --> 49:47.527
You stay.

49:49.237 --> 49:50.781
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

49:52.658 --> 49:53.742
Let's do this.

49:53.909 --> 49:56.536
Freeze! I said freeze,
drop your weapons!

50:01.500 --> 50:03.794
Shit, get back.
Stay down, stay down. Don't move.

50:03.960 --> 50:06.380
Johnson, call for backup.
Call for backup.

50:06.546 --> 50:08.507
There's shots fired down here!

50:08.674 --> 50:10.354
<i>- We need backup!
- What do you see, Ronny?</i>

50:10.425 --> 50:12.135
Talk to me, buddy. Talk to me.

50:12.302 --> 50:13.887
The bald perp's behind the trucks.

50:14.054 --> 50:16.056
No eyes on him.
If they move, I got 'em.

50:16.223 --> 50:18.600
Okay, you see anything,
you talk to me, you got it?

50:18.767 --> 50:20.769
Roger that.

50:22.521 --> 50:25.023
- Johnson, get to the back.
- Roger. I got it.

50:25.190 --> 50:26.430
Stay here, don't move.
You hear?

50:26.525 --> 50:28.318
<i>- What are you...
- Don't move, stay there!</i>

50:28.485 --> 50:30.570
Any visuals, Ronny?

50:30.737 --> 50:32.280
Nothing yet.

50:32.447 --> 50:34.741
Dispatch,
we've got guns fired here.

50:34.908 --> 50:37.536
We're gonna need backup at Empire.
Situation just got real.

50:37.703 --> 50:40.664
10-71, code two Jerome Avenue.

50:40.831 --> 50:43.500
<i>- Yeah.
- We need backup! We need backup here!</i>

50:44.710 --> 50:46.211
Got eyes on one.

50:46.378 --> 50:48.171
By the gate, by the gate!

50:50.716 --> 50:52.843
No hits, sir.
One's still behind the truck.

50:53.009 --> 50:54.553
Roger. Stay the course.

50:56.847 --> 50:58.890
Two cars headed over.
On their way.

50:59.057 --> 51:00.475
Roger that.

51:00.642 --> 51:02.477
We've got a real situation here.

51:02.644 --> 51:04.980
Tommy, what's your 10-39?

51:05.147 --> 51:07.524
Turning onto Jerome Avenue now.
Hold tight.

51:09.025 --> 51:11.111
Talk to me, boss.
What do you need?

51:12.863 --> 51:14.704
What do you need?
Talk to me, what do you need?

51:14.781 --> 51:16.199
Still no visual on the perp, sir.

51:16.366 --> 51:18.034
Still no visual.

51:20.370 --> 51:22.372
Boss, I'm getting
no response here.

51:22.539 --> 51:25.584
Lost eyes on the one
behind the truck, sir.

51:25.751 --> 51:27.210
He's definitely armed.

51:29.713 --> 51:32.591
Ronny, talk to me.
Do you have eyes on the situation?

51:34.092 --> 51:36.261
Backup, we're gonna
need some backup here!

51:37.721 --> 51:39.598
Somebody's gotta give me
something out there.

51:39.765 --> 51:41.391
Talk to me! Talk to me!

51:41.558 --> 51:43.393
What do you
need me to do, boss?

51:44.728 --> 51:46.730
Shots fired, shots fired.

51:46.897 --> 51:50.150
Backup, we need backup,
we need backup!

51:51.610 --> 51:53.236
Shots fired, shots fired!

51:53.403 --> 51:55.989
Shots fired, we need backup!

51:56.156 --> 51:59.075
We need backup! We've got officers
engaged in gunfire here.

51:59.242 --> 52:01.119
What's the ETA?

52:01.286 --> 52:03.038
Coming into Empire now.

52:03.205 --> 52:05.248
Boss, what's
the situation out there?

52:05.415 --> 52:08.418
<i>- We've got cars arriving.
- All clear, everything's all clear.</i>

52:08.585 --> 52:10.879
10-26 all clear.

52:12.339 --> 52:14.090
Backup arriving
on the scene right now.

52:14.257 --> 52:16.092
Roger that.

52:17.761 --> 52:19.679
Move!

52:29.940 --> 52:31.566
What the fuck was that about?

52:31.733 --> 52:34.414
It's about somebody with a big fucking
mouth I'm gonna have to shut.

52:34.444 --> 52:37.072
<i>- F... there he is.
- It could have been a coincidence.</i>

52:37.239 --> 52:39.032
Ain't no such thing
as a coincidence, Eddie.

52:42.327 --> 52:44.663
Mike, what the fuck
you doing here?

52:44.830 --> 52:46.414
<i>- What's up, Jimmy?
- Mike, wait...</i>

52:48.124 --> 52:50.210
Want to rat me out,
you fucking scumbag?

52:52.379 --> 52:54.464
- Mike, I didn't...
- Fucking do it.

52:54.631 --> 52:56.466
Get up. We ain't calling quits

52:56.633 --> 52:58.885
on that Empire place neither, okay?
Get the fuck in!

53:17.821 --> 53:20.073
Yeah, he shot the guy.
He's a hero.

53:20.240 --> 53:22.826
He saved the cop's life.
He could've died.

53:22.993 --> 53:25.412
MY 5Â°", my son...

53:26.705 --> 53:28.665
There he is, there he is!

53:28.832 --> 53:30.709
My hero.

53:30.876 --> 53:31.960
Say hello.

53:32.127 --> 53:33.169
I'm gonna go talk
to Eddie for a minute.

53:33.336 --> 53:35.016
- Eddie.
- I'll come back, I'll come back.

53:38.466 --> 53:40.802
Now he's a hero
he has no time for his mother.

53:40.969 --> 53:43.221
Where you been?
I was calling you all morning.

53:43.388 --> 53:45.015
Where was I?
Where the fuck were you?

53:45.181 --> 53:48.018
How crazy was that shit last night?

53:48.184 --> 53:50.353
Another crew comes to do
the same fucking shit?

53:53.398 --> 53:55.442
What? What's up with you?
Where were you?

53:55.609 --> 53:58.153
Well, Mike killed Jimmy
last night.

53:58.320 --> 53:59.529
That's where I was.

53:59.696 --> 54:01.531
<i>- What?
- Yeah.</i>

54:01.698 --> 54:04.784
Thought he ratted us out, now he wants
to go back in and rob Empire again.

54:04.951 --> 54:07.112
<i>- What, are you fucking crazy?
- It's not me, it's him!</i>

54:07.203 --> 54:09.414
Jimmy had nothing to do
with what went down last night, okay?

54:09.581 --> 54:11.458
- It was a fucking coincidence.
- I know. You know what?

54:11.625 --> 54:13.418
It's too late. Killed him, so.

54:13.585 --> 54:16.254
What the fuck's Spiro gonna do when
he finds out about this?

54:16.421 --> 54:18.381
You know he's gonna
fucking kill us, right?

54:18.548 --> 54:20.717
That's why I say
we gotta go back in there

54:20.884 --> 54:22.427
and take the money
for ourselves before Mike,

54:22.594 --> 54:24.095
<i>- before him, before anybody else does.
- What?</i>

54:24.262 --> 54:25.722
Are you fucking crazy?

54:25.889 --> 54:27.529
- No.
- They're not gonna leave the money

54:27.682 --> 54:29.809
- on the street any more anyway, okay?
- So we go inside and get it!

54:29.976 --> 54:31.686
Just fucking forget it.
Forget everything.

54:31.853 --> 54:33.271
There's cameras
at every door, okay?

54:33.438 --> 54:35.478
So why am I even talking?
I'm not even... I'm not...

54:35.565 --> 54:37.192
Cops won't expect it.
Nobody will.

54:37.359 --> 54:39.402
Shut your fucking mouth.
Will you please shut your fucking mouth?

54:39.569 --> 54:40.946
- I'm doing it with or without you.
- Oh really?

54:41.112 --> 54:42.530
<i>- You gonna do it without me?
- Yeah yeah, really.</i>

54:42.697 --> 54:44.950
And when I get there, you can call
the cops, you can fucking shoot me

54:45.116 --> 54:47.911
or you can say "Fuck yeah, Eddie,
I'm with you." But you know what?

54:48.078 --> 54:49.871
I'm doing it.

54:50.038 --> 54:52.958
And I'm not doing this shit any more,
bro. I'm fucking done with this.

54:53.124 --> 54:55.085
- I'm done.
- Watch your mouth, okay?

54:55.251 --> 54:56.920
You watch it.

54:57.087 --> 54:58.755
I'm doing it, Chris.

54:59.923 --> 55:01.549
I know it's just you after 8:00.

55:11.685 --> 55:14.813
And it was sayonara
New York for sunny California.

55:14.980 --> 55:16.773
Albert Hammond in 1972.

55:19.025 --> 55:24.572
Got on board a westbound 747

55:27.033 --> 55:29.744
Didn't think before...

55:31.454 --> 55:33.498
What to do

55:34.791 --> 55:39.004
That talk of opportunities

55:39.170 --> 55:42.799
TV breaks and movies

55:42.966 --> 55:46.469
Rang true

55:46.636 --> 55:49.014
Sure rang true...

56:03.611 --> 56:05.530
He's fucking crazy, right?

56:05.697 --> 56:07.574
You know that Chris

56:11.327 --> 56:13.496
Fucking crazy,
I'm always fucking crazy.

56:13.663 --> 56:15.248
Well, here I am, right?

56:15.415 --> 56:18.626
- You know how many fucking times...
- Fucking Eddie.

56:18.793 --> 56:21.796
Fucking unbelievable.
Say I'm fucking coming, right?

56:21.963 --> 56:23.673
Totally won't split it.

56:23.840 --> 56:25.091
How about that?

56:25.258 --> 56:27.969
Nobody around wants to
fucking believe me, right?

56:31.514 --> 56:33.016
What the fuck?

56:40.440 --> 56:42.150
I told you I was
coming, right? Yeah.

56:42.317 --> 56:43.902
No one ever wants
to believe me, right?

56:44.069 --> 56:46.196
Well, here I am, boys.

56:46.362 --> 56:48.531
Yeah!

56:49.657 --> 56:51.576
<i>What the fuck?</i>

56:53.661 --> 56:55.538
What, are you fucking crazy?!

56:56.831 --> 56:57.874
Well...

57:04.380 --> 57:06.466
I told you
I was fucking coming, bro.

57:06.633 --> 57:08.218
How about that?

57:08.384 --> 57:10.220
What'd I tell you, right?

57:10.386 --> 57:12.222
I told you.

57:15.100 --> 57:16.476
Where's it at?

57:17.685 --> 57:18.895
I ain't leaving without it.

57:19.062 --> 57:20.980
Brother, I'm not leaving
till I get that money.

57:21.147 --> 57:22.565
I ain't leaving without it, okay?

57:22.732 --> 57:24.734
Look at you,
you look like a lunatic!

57:24.901 --> 57:26.694
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

57:26.861 --> 57:28.196
Answer the phone, go ahead.

57:28.363 --> 57:30.083
Answer the...
you answer the phone right now!

57:30.115 --> 57:32.242
You might as well shoot me
dead right now, okay?

57:32.408 --> 57:35.203
I'm not going to jail.
I'm not going to jail, bro!

57:35.370 --> 57:37.747
- I am not going to my shitty life...
- Shut up, shut the fuck up!

57:37.914 --> 57:39.040
<i>- Shut up!
- I'm not going to jail.</i>

57:39.207 --> 57:41.000
- Shut up, shut up.
- I'm not going to fucking jail.

57:41.167 --> 57:43.378
I'm not going back
to my shitty life right now!

57:43.545 --> 57:45.922
- Answer the phone, go ahead.
- Shut your mouth. Shut it.

57:50.218 --> 57:52.262
Yeah, this is Chris. 18249.

57:52.428 --> 57:54.514
Hey, it's Honeywell.
What's going on over there?

57:54.681 --> 57:57.081
We got a reading. There's some kind
of a disturbance or what?

57:57.100 --> 57:59.310
You fucked me.

57:59.477 --> 58:01.437
We can fucking do this right now.
We can fucking do this.

58:01.604 --> 58:03.398
Hey, are you out there or what?

58:03.565 --> 58:05.567
Yo, you want me to call this in?

58:05.733 --> 58:08.111
- Chris, Chris?
- Yeah, it's okay, Duffy.

58:08.278 --> 58:10.446
My... my lights on here.
Everything's fine.

58:10.613 --> 58:12.240
- Fuck!
- All right, go back to sleep.

58:12.407 --> 58:14.742
- I'll try not to wake you up again.
- Yeah, okay.

58:18.621 --> 58:20.957
Open this. Come on,
I know you've got the keys.

58:21.124 --> 58:23.293
Open this right now.
Where's the key right now?

58:23.459 --> 58:25.211
Give me the key, come on.

58:26.296 --> 58:27.797
Chris, gimme the key!

58:29.132 --> 58:30.675
<i>- What the fuck am I doing?
- Open it.</i>

58:30.842 --> 58:32.844
- Open it, open it.
- Yeah. Yeah.

58:34.470 --> 58:35.597
Fuck.

58:40.185 --> 58:41.978
How do you open this?
Open this right now.

58:42.145 --> 58:44.314
How do you open it? Open it.

58:44.480 --> 58:46.149
Come on, open it!

58:48.234 --> 58:50.486
Come on, open it!

58:53.781 --> 58:55.825
Un-fucking-believable.

58:55.992 --> 58:58.870
- Un-fucking-believable.
- Holy shit.

59:00.163 --> 59:02.332
Put your fucking mask on.

59:04.334 --> 59:06.044
What the fuck am I doing?

59:09.005 --> 59:10.590
Fuck shit!

59:10.757 --> 59:13.176
What the fuck?

59:14.219 --> 59:15.845
You shot the fucking dog?

59:16.012 --> 59:18.264
Yeah, thanks for telling me
there was a dog, asshole!

59:18.431 --> 59:19.474
- Fuck.
- Dick!

59:19.641 --> 59:21.267
Un-fucking-real.

59:24.020 --> 59:26.022
What am I gonna fucking
tell people?

59:26.189 --> 59:28.816
You gonna help me
carry this shit out or what?

59:28.983 --> 59:30.526
There's a fucking camera, you idiot!

59:30.693 --> 59:32.028
Where?

59:35.114 --> 59:37.492
What are you doing?
That's fucking great, Eddie.

59:37.659 --> 59:39.494
What am I gonna tell people?

59:39.661 --> 59:41.829
You tell me, what am I gonna
fucking tell people now?

59:41.996 --> 59:44.666
You're on the camera and you're
talking to me, you fucking idiot!

01:00:04.394 --> 01:00:07.897
Damn, we got clowns
in every room here.

01:00:09.983 --> 01:00:11.609
Aww shit.

01:00:11.776 --> 01:00:13.987
Hey, you might want
to go holler at your boy there

01:00:14.153 --> 01:00:16.281
before these FBI clowns
take over from him.

01:00:23.746 --> 01:00:26.416
Looks like your party got
a little out of whack here.

01:00:28.167 --> 01:00:29.919
Look at this place?

01:00:30.086 --> 01:00:31.754
God, look at you.

01:00:31.921 --> 01:00:34.340
Yeah, I... I was on the phone

01:00:34.507 --> 01:00:36.551
- and then...
- You were on the phone?

01:00:36.718 --> 01:00:38.761
You were on that phone
right there?

01:00:39.971 --> 01:00:41.806
<i>- You make a call there?
- No no.</i>

01:00:41.973 --> 01:00:43.766
- I...
- Not that.

01:00:45.184 --> 01:00:47.228
I don't know.
My head's all messed up.

01:00:49.355 --> 01:00:51.190
Three times in a month is crazy.

01:00:51.357 --> 01:00:53.443
Man, what are the odds of that?

01:00:53.609 --> 01:00:55.320
Three times. What are the odds

01:00:55.486 --> 01:00:57.613
that the guy knew exactly
where the keys were too?

01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:59.240
Unbelievable.

01:00:59.407 --> 01:01:00.825
The dog passed out from fear.

01:01:00.992 --> 01:01:03.619
9mm must have scared
the shit out of him.

01:01:03.786 --> 01:01:06.289
They found it unconscious.
They thought it was dead.

01:01:06.456 --> 01:01:07.957
They thought the dog was dead.

01:01:08.124 --> 01:01:10.752
- I'm Detective Ransone.
- Yeah, I know who you are.

01:01:10.918 --> 01:01:13.296
Listen, so what have we got here?

01:01:13.463 --> 01:01:16.883
We've got three break-ins
on the same premises,

01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:19.844
we've got two men dead,
we've got no arrests.

01:01:20.011 --> 01:01:22.180
Does anybody here
have any idea how many

01:01:22.347 --> 01:01:25.141
dollars that disappeared
from this spot?

01:01:25.308 --> 01:01:26.934
Detective Ransone

01:01:27.101 --> 01:01:28.644
or Mister...
how do you pronounce it?

01:01:28.811 --> 01:01:30.313
Patemi, is it?

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:31.481
Potamitis.

01:01:31.647 --> 01:01:34.817
Yeah. See, now you know why

01:01:34.984 --> 01:01:36.861
the FBI is rolling up in here.

01:01:37.028 --> 01:01:40.156
Yeah, so.

01:01:40.323 --> 01:01:43.159
Mr. Potamias,
you got Santa Claus

01:01:43.326 --> 01:01:45.328
coming through
your ceiling, right?

01:01:45.495 --> 01:01:46.996
They break in your gate,

01:01:47.163 --> 01:01:49.457
shooting a 9mm
within proximity of your dog

01:01:49.624 --> 01:01:51.626
and you're unconscious.

01:01:51.793 --> 01:01:53.669
Yeah. No, I...

01:01:55.171 --> 01:01:57.131
I don't know. I was making
the rounds. I come back

01:01:57.298 --> 01:01:58.633
and I guess somebody hit me.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.551
You weren't on the phone?

01:02:00.718 --> 01:02:03.763
No phonecall? Didn't you tell me
you were on that phone?

01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:07.600
Honeywell called and you said
everything was okay.

01:02:07.767 --> 01:02:10.311
<i>- Was it okay?
- Yeah, like I said...</i>

01:02:10.478 --> 01:02:12.814
no, I was making the rounds.
I come back and some...

01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:14.941
Somebody hit you.

01:02:16.025 --> 01:02:17.360
Yeah.

01:02:17.527 --> 01:02:18.736
Nothing caught your eye?

01:02:18.903 --> 01:02:21.614
Nothing seemed out
of the ordinary at that time?

01:02:21.781 --> 01:02:23.408
The camera outside's broke,

01:02:23.574 --> 01:02:26.054
so the only visuals I had were
on the money room and the doors.

01:02:26.202 --> 01:02:28.287
Yeah, and somebody's
coming through your ceiling.

01:02:28.454 --> 01:02:30.331
That's a brilliant move.

01:02:30.498 --> 01:02:32.834
- Very clever.
- It's really clever.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.794
Very clever, very tricky.

01:02:34.961 --> 01:02:36.838
These guys are something else?

01:02:37.004 --> 01:02:39.048
<i>- Excuse me, sir.
- So you got anything else for us,</i>

01:02:39.215 --> 01:02:41.050
- Mister...
- Potami.

01:02:41.217 --> 01:02:42.260
Potami?

01:02:42.427 --> 01:02:45.179
Detective Ransone,
any more questions?

01:02:45.346 --> 01:02:47.223
No, I think you guys
covered everything.

01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:49.392
No? Good.
So we're done here, right?

01:02:49.559 --> 01:02:52.228
Somebody get this kid to a hospital.

01:02:53.938 --> 01:02:55.898
Unbelievable.

01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:22.049
Mr. Potamatis, Ernie Anastos.

01:03:22.216 --> 01:03:24.594
It's been reported that
over $9 million were taken

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:26.846
in last night's heist.
Do you have anything to say about that?

01:03:27.013 --> 01:03:28.014
No.

01:03:28.181 --> 01:03:29.782
Can I just ask you
a couple of questions?

01:03:29.932 --> 01:03:31.100
Five minutes?

01:03:34.353 --> 01:03:35.938
Keep shooting. Keep shooting.

01:04:00.087 --> 01:04:01.631
God damn it, Eddie.

01:04:10.806 --> 01:04:11.849
Hey hey-

01:04:12.016 --> 01:04:14.310
- Hey.
- What's going on?

01:04:14.477 --> 01:04:17.146
Nothing, I was...
I need to go for a walk.

01:04:17.313 --> 01:04:19.899
Go for a walk?
Where are you gonna go for a walk?

01:04:21.275 --> 01:04:22.944
Where are you gonna go?

01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:25.196
Nowhere.
I'm just going for a walk.

01:04:25.363 --> 01:04:28.491
Where you gonna go? The police
are out there looking for you.

01:04:28.658 --> 01:04:31.077
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:04:31.244 --> 01:04:33.204
<i>- I just... I'm sorry.
- What's going on?</i>

01:04:33.371 --> 01:04:36.040
- I gotta go for a walk.
- What's going on? What's going on?

01:04:36.207 --> 01:04:37.833
- Nothing. I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.503
You're not fine. Come on.

01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:43.714
You were out all night. The police are
here all day looking for you.

01:04:43.881 --> 01:04:46.008
Your face... come on, tell me.

01:04:46.175 --> 01:04:47.385
Tell me, tell me.

01:04:47.552 --> 01:04:49.095
- Talk to me.
- Nothing. No, I...

01:04:49.262 --> 01:04:51.180
- I'm gonna go for a walk.
- No.

01:04:51.347 --> 01:04:53.266
- I'm gonna come back. I'm okay.
- You're not okay. Listen...

01:04:53.432 --> 01:04:55.017
- You're not okay.
- I'm okay, Pop. I'm all right.

01:04:55.184 --> 01:04:56.644
Don't walk away! Listen to me.
I'm talking to you. Chris!

01:04:56.811 --> 01:04:58.521
- Chris, listen to me!
- I'm sorry.

01:04:58.688 --> 01:05:00.489
If goddamn Eddie has
something to do with this

01:05:00.606 --> 01:05:03.067
to make the police come for you again,
I'm gonna kill him, you hear me?

01:05:03.234 --> 01:05:05.236
Listen to me!

01:05:14.412 --> 01:05:16.914
U.S. District Attorney Giuliani,
welcome.

01:05:17.081 --> 01:05:19.208
<i>- Agents Nugent, Marichal.
- Hey, how you doing?</i>

01:05:19.375 --> 01:05:20.793
- Hot enough for you or what?
- Good to see you.

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.044
How are you doing, fellas?

01:05:22.211 --> 01:05:24.171
So how much are
we talking about being taken here?

01:05:24.213 --> 01:05:26.299
Yeah well, the newspapers
are downplaying it,

01:05:26.465 --> 01:05:29.093
but we think
it's upwards of $10 million.

01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:31.429
- Jesus Christ.
- The largest one in history.

01:05:31.596 --> 01:05:33.889
And the security guard,
there was only one?

01:05:34.056 --> 01:05:36.392
Only one guard, but he doesn't
really seem that capable

01:05:36.559 --> 01:05:39.039
- of much of anything, sir.
- Well, seemed capable of shooting

01:05:39.061 --> 01:05:41.621
a would-be robber two nights prior
according to this report here.

01:05:41.772 --> 01:05:44.233
You're right about that,
sir, but listen,

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:47.153
we think that whole thing
might have been a decoy.

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:50.740
Because we've got the guy
on surveillance tape, right?

01:05:50.906 --> 01:05:56.078
Two nights prior, he's disabling
a video camera in the back.

01:05:56.245 --> 01:05:58.122
So you think the two are connected?

01:05:58.289 --> 01:06:01.417
Yeah, but talking about
details, manpower...

01:06:01.584 --> 01:06:03.586
there's no doubt about it...

01:06:03.753 --> 01:06:05.254
we're talking Cosa Nostra.

01:06:05.421 --> 01:06:07.965
And the detective who's been
on since the beginning...

01:06:08.132 --> 01:06:09.759
Detective J. Ransone?

01:06:09.925 --> 01:06:11.844
Yeah, he's setting up
a makeshift interrogation

01:06:12.011 --> 01:06:14.221
over at Empire right now.

01:06:14.388 --> 01:06:17.767
- You find that funny?
- Mr. Giuliani, there's no way in hell

01:06:17.933 --> 01:06:20.811
that that greaseball guard could
pull off this job on his own.

01:06:20.978 --> 01:06:23.606
It's just too big for him.
I'm willing to put my badge on it.

01:06:23.773 --> 01:06:27.276
Well, no harm in letting him follow
through with the workers,

01:06:27.443 --> 01:06:29.779
but I tend to agree
with Marichal here.

01:06:29.945 --> 01:06:31.822
This thing stinks of organized crime.

01:06:31.989 --> 01:06:34.659
- Agreed.
- Go after all five families.

01:06:34.825 --> 01:06:36.702
Someone's gonna talk.

01:06:39.455 --> 01:06:42.291
Under District Attorney
Rudolph Giuliani's orders

01:06:42.458 --> 01:06:44.794
members of all five
of New York's crime families

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:47.838
have been arrested to be questioned
in regard to the Empire heist.

01:06:48.005 --> 01:06:49.048
You missed some shit on your upper lip.

01:06:49.215 --> 01:06:50.424
<i>- You should shave that off.
- Now believed to be the largest</i>

01:06:50.591 --> 01:06:52.301
since Lufthansa.

01:06:52.468 --> 01:06:54.345
War...

01:06:54.512 --> 01:06:57.223
- $8 million, 9 million, how much is it?
- Hey, how you doing?

01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:59.430
- No one seems to know anything...
- Hey, back off!

01:06:59.475 --> 01:07:01.394
- ...Other than this is...
- Where's the money, Giuseppe?

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.562
The biggest heist in U.S. history.

01:07:03.729 --> 01:07:08.359
Ladies and gentlemen,
someone out there has a lot of cash.

01:07:08.526 --> 01:07:10.361
It's your half right there,
every penny.

01:07:10.528 --> 01:07:13.155
<i>- Told you we could pull that off.
- You fucking ass!</i>

01:07:13.322 --> 01:07:16.075
That's for breaking
my fucking face.

01:07:17.201 --> 01:07:18.828
How else were you
gonna say you had

01:07:18.994 --> 01:07:21.497
nothing to do with it? Fuck!

01:07:21.664 --> 01:07:23.791
I talked to Mike.
He wants to...

01:07:23.958 --> 01:07:25.668
Mike wants to meet with us.

01:07:27.002 --> 01:07:28.003
You fucking...

01:07:29.672 --> 01:07:31.549
What was I supposed to do?
He called me.

01:07:31.716 --> 01:07:34.218
He said we go in with
the Colombian deal on him and that's it.

01:07:34.385 --> 01:07:36.512
He won't say nothing
to anybody, so that's it.

01:07:36.679 --> 01:07:38.681
<i>- There it is.
- I'm gonna get in my car.</i>

01:07:38.848 --> 01:07:41.089
You come around me again,
and I'm gonna fucking kill you.

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:43.540
- What else was I supposed to say?
- I will fucking kill you.

01:07:43.561 --> 01:07:45.921
<i>- You understand me?
- I just handed you $8 fucking million!</i>

01:07:46.021 --> 01:07:48.021
You didn't hand me fucking shit,
you understand me?

01:07:48.065 --> 01:07:49.945
- Get the fuck...
- Didn't hand me fucking shit.

01:07:50.025 --> 01:07:51.402
And you walk the fuck away

01:07:51.569 --> 01:07:53.320
and you tell Mike to do
the same or I'll kill you both.

01:07:53.487 --> 01:07:55.127
- I'll fucking kill you.
- Yeah, fuck you!

01:07:55.197 --> 01:07:57.366
I should have shot you when
you came through that fucking roof.

01:07:57.533 --> 01:07:58.826
Fucking prick.

01:08:24.769 --> 01:08:26.228
This fucking cocaine.

01:08:33.736 --> 01:08:35.738
You know I should kill you, right?

01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:38.783
Slit your throat...

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:41.076
for backstabbing me like you did.

01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:45.872
I mean,
that's why I'm here right now.

01:08:47.124 --> 01:08:48.542
I'll pay you back.

01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:50.669
And your friend?

01:08:51.879 --> 01:08:54.048
He had nothing
to do with it. He just...

01:08:54.215 --> 01:08:56.008
didn't rat me out, so.

01:08:56.175 --> 01:08:58.719
That's it.

01:09:00.179 --> 01:09:02.139
I'm not an asshole, Eddie.

01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:05.518
Fucking look at me, okay?

01:09:07.353 --> 01:09:08.938
Listen, I'm in.

01:09:09.104 --> 01:09:11.232
I'm all the way in, so.

01:09:11.398 --> 01:09:14.276
But Chris stays out of it
and that's the way it's gonna be.

01:09:14.443 --> 01:09:15.778
You could shoot me, you could do
whatever you want to do,

01:09:15.944 --> 01:09:17.321
but you know what?

01:09:20.157 --> 01:09:22.451
Kill me, you don't find out
where the money is, and...

01:09:22.618 --> 01:09:25.662
you know, and I'll tell
Spiro about Jimmy, so.

01:09:25.830 --> 01:09:28.122
You know?

01:09:28.290 --> 01:09:29.959
Okay.

01:09:31.335 --> 01:09:33.170
It goes down tomorrow then.

01:09:33.337 --> 01:09:35.464
Good.

01:09:35.631 --> 01:09:37.966
Don't disappear.

01:09:38.133 --> 01:09:40.469
- Not going anywhere.
- Yeah.

01:09:40.636 --> 01:09:42.971
Good. Now get the fuck out.

01:09:43.138 --> 01:09:44.932
All right.

01:09:55.651 --> 01:09:58.612
- You got something?
- Somewhere in here.

01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:05.327
Got it.

01:10:05.494 --> 01:10:07.830
- Let's get outta here.
- What, we stepping out?

01:10:07.997 --> 01:10:09.456
<i>- Yeah.
- Okay, let's do this.</i>

01:10:14.295 --> 01:10:18.090
Michael, where's...

01:10:20.259 --> 01:10:22.428
- Where's what?
- Where's Jimmy?

01:10:22.595 --> 01:10:24.763
Where's he been lately?

01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:27.766
- Jimmy's working.
- No, I know, he hasn't been here in...

01:10:27.933 --> 01:10:29.226
it's been like almost a week.

01:10:29.393 --> 01:10:31.061
He's always with you.
I'm just wondering.

01:10:31.228 --> 01:10:32.521
I'm just wondering where he is.

01:10:32.688 --> 01:10:34.529
I think he's got the...
the construction thing.

01:10:34.565 --> 01:10:36.317
<i>- Oh yeah yeah.
- He's been working at that movie house.</i>

01:10:36.483 --> 01:10:38.110
So it's been real busy over there.

01:10:38.277 --> 01:10:40.362
Yanni, that looks good. Can you
turn it on? You can't turn it on?

01:10:40.529 --> 01:10:42.323
There's a lava
in the back I think.

01:10:42.489 --> 01:10:43.574
It looks good anyway.

01:10:43.741 --> 01:10:44.992
Where the hell are you going?

01:10:45.159 --> 01:10:47.494
Use the bathroom.

01:10:56.337 --> 01:10:57.880
Hey, I'm looking for a...

01:10:58.047 --> 01:10:59.882
Spiro Stravakis.

01:11:00.049 --> 01:11:02.384
- Stavrakis.
- Stavrakis!

01:11:02.551 --> 01:11:04.678
That's good.
Are the police asking?

01:11:04.845 --> 01:11:07.723
- What, that obvious?
- Only if you're the police.

01:11:09.058 --> 01:11:11.727
Yeah, we came here
about the Empire heist.

01:11:11.894 --> 01:11:14.104
Just curious if anybody
knew anything about it.

01:11:14.271 --> 01:11:16.065
The Empire heist in the Bronx?

01:11:16.231 --> 01:11:17.858
And you're here looking?

01:11:18.025 --> 01:11:20.945
I thought the papers said
that was the Guineas.

01:11:21.111 --> 01:11:23.197
- You know, the real mob.
- You know.

01:11:23.364 --> 01:11:25.324
Big-time lowlifes,
small-time lowlifes...

01:11:25.491 --> 01:11:27.868
it's all the same to me.

01:11:29.078 --> 01:11:31.080
Ain't that right there, Michael...

01:11:31.246 --> 01:11:33.874
Dimitriu? Did I say that right?

01:11:34.041 --> 01:11:36.418
You come into my place
and you start saying people's names,

01:11:36.585 --> 01:11:38.879
- but you never said your name.
- You're right.

01:11:39.046 --> 01:11:41.507
- We didn't.
- And what are you insinuating?

01:11:41.674 --> 01:11:44.426
That maybe Michael here had
something to do with this robbery?

01:11:44.593 --> 01:11:47.304
Just want to ask your boy
if he have any ideas on it, that's all.

01:11:47.471 --> 01:11:50.599
My boy, detectives,
has the good fucking sense to know

01:11:50.766 --> 01:11:53.686
that if he or anyone around me had
anything to do with something like this

01:11:53.769 --> 01:11:55.938
without my knowledge,
that they'd lose their balls.

01:11:56.105 --> 01:12:00.067
So no, you can be certain
he has no ideas on this.

01:12:00.234 --> 01:12:02.361
So you're answering for him?

01:12:02.528 --> 01:12:05.030
- I just did.
- He's answering for you.

01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:12.121
Okay. Well, we got nothing else.

01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:17.334
- Yassou?
- Yassou, yeah.

01:12:17.501 --> 01:12:18.836
All right.

01:12:21.296 --> 01:12:22.423
Yassou.

01:12:28.053 --> 01:12:29.096
Michael, have a seat.

01:12:42.568 --> 01:12:45.779
Look at him,
he's talking to someone.

01:12:47.656 --> 01:12:50.284
<i>- Son of a bitch.
- You sure?</i>

01:12:50.451 --> 01:12:52.292
I'm positive.
He's looking right at the camera.

01:12:52.453 --> 01:12:54.254
I've been looking
at this thing all afternoon.

01:12:54.371 --> 01:12:56.540
Here he is.

01:12:56.707 --> 01:12:58.500
Son of a bitch.

01:13:02.046 --> 01:13:03.672
Hey, Chris. Hey, man.

01:13:03.839 --> 01:13:05.340
- Hey.
- How you doing?

01:13:05.507 --> 01:13:07.968
Come on in.
Hey, guys, give me the office for a sec.

01:13:08.135 --> 01:13:09.928
<i>- Sure.
- Hey, listen, I never got the chance</i>

01:13:10.095 --> 01:13:12.095
to properly thank you
for saving my life out there.

01:13:12.222 --> 01:13:13.807
So thank you.

01:13:13.974 --> 01:13:15.851
Yeah, I'm glad to see
you're doing okay.

01:13:16.018 --> 01:13:17.603
Yeah, me too. Here, grab a...

01:13:17.770 --> 01:13:19.271
grab a seat, sit down.

01:13:21.523 --> 01:13:23.859
Listen, thanks
for coming down, man.

01:13:24.026 --> 01:13:26.028
You know, any time something
like this happens

01:13:26.195 --> 01:13:28.322
we gotta bring you down,
we gotta talk to people.

01:13:28.489 --> 01:13:31.116
It's all the procedural bullshit.
You know the drill.

01:13:31.283 --> 01:13:33.202
- Yeah, for sure.
- Okay.

01:13:33.368 --> 01:13:35.245
So I gotta ask you...

01:13:35.412 --> 01:13:37.748
nothing seemed out
of the ordinary? Not a thing?

01:13:37.915 --> 01:13:40.042
I know it sounds crazy,

01:13:40.209 --> 01:13:42.127
but, you know,
I was making the rounds,

01:13:42.294 --> 01:13:45.714
I went to the bathroom.
I didn't hear anything. I come back.

01:13:47.049 --> 01:13:49.218
That's it.

01:13:51.887 --> 01:13:53.639
You know these guys?

01:13:55.516 --> 01:13:57.726
That guy's a Michael Dimitriu

01:13:57.893 --> 01:14:00.145
and another guy's
Eddie Papastratos.

01:14:00.312 --> 01:14:03.649
They're small time criminals,
but I wanted to know if you knew them.

01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:09.071
- Yeah, why?
- I was just checking, that's all.

01:14:13.492 --> 01:14:15.828
I mean I haven't spoken
to them in a while, you know, if...

01:14:17.162 --> 01:14:18.622
SO...

01:14:18.789 --> 01:14:20.582
you know, I'm sure they had
nothing to do with this

01:14:20.749 --> 01:14:23.210
<i>- if that's what you're saying.
- I didn't say that.</i>

01:14:24.419 --> 01:14:25.712
But okay.

01:14:28.757 --> 01:14:30.425
Okay, so,

01:14:30.592 --> 01:14:32.594
you have any more questions
or is that it?

01:14:32.761 --> 01:14:34.805
You said that there was
only one guy, right,

01:14:34.972 --> 01:14:37.182
- who broke in, the robber?
- No no, I didn't.

01:14:37.349 --> 01:14:39.476
You know,
I didn't see anyone, so.

01:14:41.728 --> 01:14:43.105
You know we got this video here

01:14:43.272 --> 01:14:46.275
and near the money room

01:14:46.441 --> 01:14:48.277
right before the guy
with the ski mask

01:14:48.443 --> 01:14:50.612
looks up and he smashes
the surveillance camera,

01:14:50.779 --> 01:14:52.447
it's like he's talking to someone.

01:14:52.614 --> 01:14:53.615
Then he looks up

01:14:53.782 --> 01:14:56.118
like someone told him
where the camera was.

01:14:56.285 --> 01:14:57.744
It's the weirdest thing.

01:14:57.911 --> 01:15:01.081
Like I told you,
I didn't see anyone, so.

01:15:01.248 --> 01:15:03.625
Yeah, you said that already...
a few times.

01:15:03.792 --> 01:15:06.086
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:15:06.253 --> 01:15:08.005
Okay, you don't know nothing.

01:15:13.051 --> 01:15:14.595
Okay, are we good?

01:15:14.761 --> 01:15:16.471
Yeah yeah yeah. We're done.

01:15:16.638 --> 01:15:18.098
Okay, great.

01:15:18.265 --> 01:15:20.350
I thanked you
for saving my life, right?

01:15:20.517 --> 01:15:22.644
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

01:15:24.605 --> 01:15:26.315
But that don't mean
for a goddamn second

01:15:26.481 --> 01:15:28.358
that I won't hesitate
to drag your ass in

01:15:28.525 --> 01:15:30.819
if I find out you've been lying
to me about all this shit.

01:15:32.321 --> 01:15:33.989
Do you understand?

01:15:35.490 --> 01:15:37.242
Yeah, I got it.

01:15:39.161 --> 01:15:40.329
All right, we're cool.

01:15:42.539 --> 01:15:43.957
Now you can go.

01:16:20.327 --> 01:16:21.703
Hey!

01:16:24.539 --> 01:16:25.707
Spiro wants to talk.

01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:28.377
Get in.

01:16:46.561 --> 01:16:48.105
Yo, Orlanda.

01:16:59.324 --> 01:17:01.576
Please, sit down, yeah?

01:17:01.743 --> 01:17:03.203
Here.

01:17:12.087 --> 01:17:13.422
You're late?

01:17:18.385 --> 01:17:20.929
So this is where we hang out?

01:17:21.096 --> 01:17:23.098
The big time.

01:17:26.101 --> 01:17:28.812
Please, no secrets.

01:17:30.355 --> 01:17:32.441
Put your bag down
right next to ours.

01:17:34.901 --> 01:17:36.570
It's cool.

01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:47.789
Eight mill, all there.

01:17:49.958 --> 01:17:51.460
The coke pure?

01:17:51.626 --> 01:17:53.462
Why do people always ask that?

01:17:53.628 --> 01:17:56.214
It's the movies, yeah?
Of course.

01:17:59.176 --> 01:18:00.302
Clean?

01:18:00.469 --> 01:18:01.970
Of course.

01:18:08.143 --> 01:18:10.645
Now you must have
serious financing

01:18:10.812 --> 01:18:13.523
for Mike to make you his partner
instead of Jimmy.

01:18:13.690 --> 01:18:15.609
- Right?
- Yeah well,

01:18:15.776 --> 01:18:17.819
listen, Jimmy ain't
a part of this no more.

01:18:17.986 --> 01:18:19.404
Okay?

01:18:23.825 --> 01:18:25.327
Okay.

01:18:26.453 --> 01:18:28.163
Let's count it.

01:18:33.877 --> 01:18:35.545
And now we wait?

01:18:35.712 --> 01:18:38.173
It's a lot of money to count.

01:18:56.108 --> 01:18:57.401
Christo Christara.

01:18:57.567 --> 01:19:00.529
You've been through
a lot lately?

01:19:00.695 --> 01:19:03.115
Some couple of fucking days.

01:19:04.324 --> 01:19:05.867
We got something for you.

01:19:06.034 --> 01:19:07.786
Where's...
where's our special guest?

01:19:07.953 --> 01:19:09.514
Anybody know where
our special guest is?

01:19:09.538 --> 01:19:12.207
- Taking a piss.
- He's taking a piss?

01:19:14.376 --> 01:19:15.877
He's taking a piss.

01:19:16.962 --> 01:19:19.005
Hey, he's taking a piss.

01:19:20.966 --> 01:19:22.676
Okay, so.

01:19:22.843 --> 01:19:25.720
Before you tell me where the money
from the robbery is in the Bronx...

01:19:25.887 --> 01:19:27.848
and you're gonna fucking tell me,
which is the only reason

01:19:28.014 --> 01:19:29.855
we don't bash your
fucking head in right now...

01:19:29.891 --> 01:19:32.018
but before you do,
there's somebody I want you to meet

01:19:32.185 --> 01:19:34.563
who's been telling me about a robbery
you didn't want to include me in on.

01:19:34.729 --> 01:19:35.939
Spiro, listen,

01:19:36.106 --> 01:19:37.899
I don't know what
you're talking about, okay?

01:19:38.066 --> 01:19:40.235
Hey, I understand. I understand!
That's why I'm saying

01:19:40.402 --> 01:19:42.112
I just want you
to meet somebody first.

01:19:42.279 --> 01:19:44.114
It's not a big fucking deal!

01:19:44.281 --> 01:19:46.575
And here he comes.
We don't have to wait any longer.

01:19:46.741 --> 01:19:48.410
Our fucking special guest...

01:19:48.577 --> 01:19:50.704
Mr. Jimmy back
from the fucking dead.

01:19:50.871 --> 01:19:52.914
Unbelievable, right?

01:19:53.081 --> 01:19:56.042
Next time you want to kill somebody,
make sure you fucking kill him!

01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:02.466
How you doing now, Christo?

01:20:10.015 --> 01:20:12.601
Now go get my fucking money.

01:20:25.947 --> 01:20:27.282
Two?

01:20:27.449 --> 01:20:28.783
Yeah.

01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:30.869
Eddie Papastratos
working tonight?

01:20:32.162 --> 01:20:33.622
Not tonight.

01:20:33.788 --> 01:20:35.540
How about his friend, Chris Potami?

01:20:35.707 --> 01:20:37.751
Who's asking?

01:20:37.918 --> 01:20:39.461
Cops.

01:20:40.587 --> 01:20:43.173
How about some menus?

01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:46.510
Naw, it's all right, honey.
We really are cops though.

01:20:46.676 --> 01:20:48.845
If it's okay,
we'd like to look in Eddie's locker.

01:20:49.012 --> 01:20:50.764
Is that all right?

01:20:51.806 --> 01:20:54.309
Eleni, come here.

01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:56.728
These guys say they're cops

01:20:56.895 --> 01:20:59.356
and they want to look
in Eddie's locker or something.

01:20:59.523 --> 01:21:01.733
You're cops, the two of you?

01:21:03.652 --> 01:21:05.570
<i>- Those real?
- Yes ma'am.</i>

01:21:05.737 --> 01:21:07.906
- Yeah.
- What'd he do?

01:21:08.073 --> 01:21:09.824
Well, we're hoping nothing.

01:21:11.368 --> 01:21:13.203
All right then. Come on.

01:21:13.370 --> 01:21:15.330
- Just follow you?
- Yep.

01:21:20.335 --> 01:21:22.170
Go ahead, do what you want.

01:21:22.337 --> 01:21:23.964
- Which one?
- Middle.

01:21:24.130 --> 01:21:26.424
It's okay?

01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:31.110
Find any shit about another girl
in there, you hand it over to me.

01:21:31.137 --> 01:21:32.847
Yeah, you got it.

01:21:43.858 --> 01:21:45.777
No goddamn way.

01:21:54.828 --> 01:21:56.496
Is eight.

01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:00.292
Eight million.

01:22:00.458 --> 01:22:02.377
It's all there.

01:22:02.544 --> 01:22:04.713
Here's 400 extra.

01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:08.091
It's yours.

01:22:10.385 --> 01:22:12.220
Okay,

01:22:12.387 --> 01:22:14.222
you can go now.

01:22:15.557 --> 01:22:17.851
<i>- What are you talking about?
- Stand up,</i>

01:22:18.018 --> 01:22:20.437
turn around and walk
out that door.

01:22:21.479 --> 01:22:23.315
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:22:24.566 --> 01:22:25.942
It's not hard.

01:22:26.109 --> 01:22:28.069
Stand up...

01:22:28.236 --> 01:22:29.821
turn around

01:22:29.988 --> 01:22:31.468
- and walk out the door.
- Sit still.

01:22:31.615 --> 01:22:33.416
What the fuck are you
talking about, walk out?

01:22:33.491 --> 01:22:35.410
<i>- Relax relax.
- I said turn around,</i>

01:22:35.577 --> 01:22:37.287
<i>- and walk out the door, yeah?
- What's going on?</i>

01:22:37.454 --> 01:22:39.205
- Turn around and walk out the door.
- Okay, chill.

01:22:39.372 --> 01:22:40.749
Put the gun down,
put the gun down.

01:22:40.915 --> 01:22:42.959
- I said do yourself a favor.
- What the fuck is going on?

01:22:43.126 --> 01:22:44.753
Walk out the door.

01:22:44.919 --> 01:22:47.714
- Go!
- You shot me in my fucking mouth?

01:22:47.881 --> 01:22:49.174
Get the fuck out! Go now!

01:22:49.341 --> 01:22:51.217
Get the fuck out of here now!

01:22:51.384 --> 01:22:53.595
- Get the fuck out now!
- Are you fucking serious?

01:22:53.762 --> 01:22:55.764
- In the fucking mouth!
- Heavenly Father

01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:00.769
Save the people

01:23:00.935 --> 01:23:03.229
Save their souls

01:23:03.396 --> 01:23:05.607
- Save our father...
- Come on, come on, come on.

01:23:05.774 --> 01:23:07.984
Save our mother...

01:23:08.151 --> 01:23:09.944
Fuck!

01:23:10.111 --> 01:23:12.781
<i>- Save the people...
- Get us our fucking money!</i>

01:23:12.947 --> 01:23:14.866
Save their souls...

01:23:51.653 --> 01:23:53.029
Eddie?

01:23:55.156 --> 01:23:57.117
It's over.

01:24:01.496 --> 01:24:02.497
I'll talk to him.

01:24:04.374 --> 01:24:07.001
Eddie, Eddie.

01:24:10.463 --> 01:24:11.673
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

01:24:13.258 --> 01:24:15.844
My DA's got half
the Italian mob on lockdown,

01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:20.348
my lieutenant's wondering how
half the missing Empire money

01:24:20.515 --> 01:24:24.269
landed in the lap of some
mid-level Colombian cocaine dealer

01:24:24.436 --> 01:24:27.689
and I'm thinking you and your friend
know where the other half is.

01:24:27.856 --> 01:24:30.024
So before I let you go...

01:24:30.191 --> 01:24:32.152
and unfortunately I have to...

01:24:32.318 --> 01:24:34.654
I've got two questions
for you, Eddie:

01:24:36.197 --> 01:24:37.615
Where's Chris?

01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:43.621
And where's the money?

01:25:04.768 --> 01:25:07.604
Chris, Chris, what is going on?

01:25:07.771 --> 01:25:10.356
I'm being serious right now.
You need to tell me what happened.

01:25:10.523 --> 01:25:12.233
Shit, my father.

01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.736
- Fuck, come on.
- Chris, I'm being serious.

01:25:14.903 --> 01:25:16.696
You need to look at me
and you need to tell me what's going on.

01:25:16.863 --> 01:25:18.698
Whatever happens, you check
the fucking statue, okay?

01:25:18.865 --> 01:25:20.116
- You check the statue.
- Chris, what?!

01:25:20.283 --> 01:25:22.243
- The money's in the fucking statue.
- Chris!

01:25:23.244 --> 01:25:24.829
Chris.

01:25:35.298 --> 01:25:36.883
Chris!

01:25:38.092 --> 01:25:39.844
Yo, Chris!

01:25:41.596 --> 01:25:43.556
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:25:43.723 --> 01:25:46.184
They know everything.
They fucking know everything.

01:25:46.351 --> 01:25:48.102
- What, who?
- The cops know everything.

01:25:48.269 --> 01:25:51.022
<i>- They got the fucking map.
- You come to me?!</i>

01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:52.750
- Oh fuck.
- What do you want me to do?

01:25:52.899 --> 01:25:54.859
It ain't that easy, bro.
It ain't that easy.

01:25:55.026 --> 01:25:56.778
Hey, you told me Jimmy was dead.

01:25:56.945 --> 01:25:58.613
He ain't fucking dead, Eddie!
He's alive.

01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:01.366
What are you talking about?
I saw Mike kill him with my own eyes.

01:26:01.533 --> 01:26:03.326
Well, he ain't dead, okay,
and we're fucked!

01:26:03.493 --> 01:26:05.493
All my money's gone.
All my money's gone right now.

01:26:05.495 --> 01:26:06.955
<i>- I need some money.
- You need some money?</i>

01:26:07.121 --> 01:26:09.082
- I need some money, ple...
- I thought you said the cops need it?

01:26:09.249 --> 01:26:10.500
- Now get the fuck outta here!
- You gotta give me that money

01:26:10.667 --> 01:26:13.711
right now. I know
it's in here somewhere, bro.

01:26:13.878 --> 01:26:15.088
<i>- I don't want to do anything.
- I'm not gonna give you</i>

01:26:15.255 --> 01:26:16.256
any fucking money, Eddie!

01:26:16.422 --> 01:26:18.466
I don't want to do anything
right now, okay? Don't make me do

01:26:18.633 --> 01:26:20.635
- anything I don't want to fucking do.
- The fuck are you doing?

01:26:20.802 --> 01:26:22.762
Don't make me fucking do
anything right now, okay?

01:26:22.929 --> 01:26:25.348
I'm so fucking serious right now.
Just show me where it is right now.

01:26:25.515 --> 01:26:27.350
Just show me where
the fucking money is, okay?

01:26:27.517 --> 01:26:29.397
- My money's for my family.
- I'm fucking sorry!

01:26:29.477 --> 01:26:31.312
- For my parents to get a house.
- I don't want it all!

01:26:31.479 --> 01:26:33.857
You could buy 10 fucking houses
with that fucking money!

01:26:34.023 --> 01:26:36.276
What about me, okay?

01:26:37.986 --> 01:26:39.153
Don't think I won't do it.

01:26:41.364 --> 01:26:43.324
Don't think I won't fucking shoot!

01:26:43.491 --> 01:26:44.659
Oh fuck!

01:26:46.828 --> 01:26:49.497
<i>- Fuck.

Yes, here they come.

D"Â°P the gun!

01:27:40.548 --> 01:27:42.550

<i>- Please, okay?

01:27:49.933 --> 01:27:51.309
It's clear!

01:27:51.476 --> 01:27:53.394
Hey, you fuck!

01:27:53.561 --> 01:27:55.730
Off off, hands off!
Hands off him, hands off.

01:27:55.897 --> 01:27:58.024
Hey, he's my father,

01:27:58.191 --> 01:27:59.901
Hey hey hey, Chris, no!

01:28:02.362 --> 01:28:04.864
Take it easy, take it easy.

01:28:05.031 --> 01:28:06.074
Oh fuck!

01:28:07.241 --> 01:28:09.077
It's okay. It's okay, Christo.

01:28:10.745 --> 01:28:12.455
It's over now.

01:28:12.622 --> 01:28:15.708
- I'm sorry, Father. I'm sorry.
- It's over now.

01:28:20.338 --> 01:28:22.715

01:28:23.758 --> 01:28:25.259
I'm fucking...
I'm fucking sorry.

01:28:25.426 --> 01:28:27.178
- It's okay, Christo.
- I fucked up.

01:28:28.262 --> 01:28:29.847
It's over now.

01:28:36.104 --> 01:28:38.439
Fuck. I fucked up.

01:28:38.606 --> 01:28:41.359
Yeah. Yeah, you did, Chris.

01:28:42.402 --> 01:28:43.653
Yeah, you did.

01:29:11.639 --> 01:29:14.767
Hey, boss, still got a lot
of money unaccounted for here.

01:29:14.934 --> 01:29:16.936
And don't you know it.

01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:20.523
You think your boy's gonna talk?

01:29:20.690 --> 01:29:23.526
Yeah.
I think he'll come to his senses.

01:29:25.153 --> 01:29:26.612
The FBI said today

01:29:26.779 --> 01:29:28.823
that the man whose job
it was to protect the money

01:29:28.990 --> 01:29:31.492
stole it: Christos Potamitis.

01:29:31.659 --> 01:29:33.995
We spoiled his vacation
where he's been

01:29:34.162 --> 01:29:36.664
sunning himself by the pool
most of the afternoon.

01:29:36.831 --> 01:29:39.208
It was a matter of me trying to get

01:29:39.375 --> 01:29:41.753
a bag to come to me.

01:29:41.919 --> 01:29:44.005
The building's landlord
said he was amazed

01:29:44.172 --> 01:29:46.007
the burglars could get
through the roof.

01:29:46.174 --> 01:29:47.800
We specifically made this roof

01:29:47.967 --> 01:29:50.720
to have steel construction
because we wanted to have

01:29:50.887 --> 01:29:52.180
the security in there.

01:29:52.346 --> 01:29:54.348
Just dollar signs,
you know, coming at me.

01:29:54.515 --> 01:29:55.850
You know? "Here we are."

01:29:56.017 --> 01:29:58.144
More arrests are
expected says the FBI,

01:29:58.311 --> 01:30:00.438
as is recovery of the 11 million,

01:30:00.605 --> 01:30:02.398
which is still missing.

01:30:02.565 --> 01:30:04.525
And the money still to this day is gone?

01:30:04.692 --> 01:30:06.569
- That's correct.
- Vanished?

01:30:06.736 --> 01:30:08.321
Just vanished.

01:30:08.488 --> 01:30:11.741
- Into thin air?
- Into thin air.

01:30:11.908 --> 01:30:14.285
The way it disappeared
out of the money room,

01:30:14.452 --> 01:30:16.037
it disappeared out of our hands.

01:30:16.204 --> 01:30:18.206
You looked like you were
about to say something.

01:30:18.372 --> 01:30:19.373
No.

01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:21.084
Okay.

01:30:21.250 --> 01:30:24.212
Seems it never rains

01:30:24.378 --> 01:30:28.382
In southern California

01:30:30.009 --> 01:30:32.345
Seems I've often heard

01:30:32.512 --> 01:30:36.557
That kind of talk before

01:30:36.724 --> 01:30:41.729
It never rains in California

01:30:41.896 --> 01:30:46.192
But, girl, don't they warn ya

01:30:46.359 --> 01:30:49.403
It pours

01:30:49.570 --> 01:30:54.158
Man, it pours

01:30:54.325 --> 01:30:57.912
Out of work, I'm out of my head

01:30:58.079 --> 01:31:01.707
Out of self-respect,
I'm out of bread

01:31:01.874 --> 01:31:05.586
I'm underloved, I'm underfed

01:31:05.753 --> 01:31:09.132
I wanna go home!

01:31:09.298 --> 01:31:14.345
It never rains in California

01:31:14.512 --> 01:31:18.516
But, girl, don't they warn ya

01:31:18.683 --> 01:31:21.936
It pours

01:31:22.103 --> 01:31:25.690
Man, it pours

01:31:42.999 --> 01:31:46.711
Will you tell the folks back home

01:31:46.878 --> 01:31:49.797
I nearly made it?

01:31:51.799 --> 01:31:54.760
Had offers, but don't know

01:31:54.927 --> 01:31:57.680
Which one to take

01:31:57.847 --> 01:31:59.891
Please

01:32:00.057 --> 01:32:03.686
Don't tell them
how you found me

01:32:03.853 --> 01:32:07.148
Don't tell 'em how you found me

01:32:07.315 --> 01:32:10.526
Gimme a break

01:32:10.693 --> 01:32:14.071
Give me a break

01:32:15.531 --> 01:32:21.996
Seems it never rains
in southern California

01:32:23.706 --> 01:32:30.755
Seems I've often heard
that kind of talk before

01:32:30.922 --> 01:32:36.427
It never rains in California

01:32:36.594 --> 01:32:40.181
But, girl, don't they warn ya

01:32:40.348 --> 01:32:43.768
It pours

01:32:43.935 --> 01:32:47.230
Man, it pours.
