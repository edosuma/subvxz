WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.210
[chattering indistinctly]

00:13.130 --> 00:15.140
[whispering]
They're coming for you. Get out.

00:22.520 --> 00:24.500
Hey, Lu.

00:24.700 --> 00:26.150
They look serious, Lu.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.440
You wanna...

00:40.660 --> 00:42.520
[alarm blaring]

00:42.720 --> 00:43.770
[guards shouting]

00:43.970 --> 00:45.400
[guard] Down on the ground!

00:45.600 --> 00:47.170
[grunting]

00:58.220 --> 01:00.120
I'm going to meetings
every day.

01:00.320 --> 01:04.540
And between that and our
one-on-ones, I'm doing better.

01:04.740 --> 01:06.340
- And work's been good?
- Sure.

01:06.540 --> 01:08.920
You know.
You work for Uncle Sam, too.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.380
Keeping the ol' republic afloat

01:10.580 --> 01:12.470
isn't exactly, uh, therapeutic.

01:12.670 --> 01:15.640
- [chuckles softly]
- But my... My coworkers are supportive,

01:15.840 --> 01:17.470
keep telling me
how good I look.

01:17.670 --> 01:19.560
You do. I wasn't lying.

01:19.760 --> 01:22.190
Ah, it just makes me realize
how busted I was before.

01:22.390 --> 01:24.560
Hey, I was a wreck
at your point in recovery.

01:24.760 --> 01:25.900
I hadn't even shaved yet.

01:26.100 --> 01:28.030
[chuckles]

01:28.230 --> 01:30.670
There's gonna be
some tough days ahead.

01:31.130 --> 01:33.780
I'm not trying to freak you out.
Just preparing you.

01:33.980 --> 01:35.950
No, I-I know. I know.

01:36.150 --> 01:39.200
But right now, I'm just
really happy to be back

01:39.400 --> 01:40.500
in the world of the living.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.920
- [cellphone dings]
- Oh.

01:43.120 --> 01:45.670
Thank you.
Ah, the nation calls.

01:45.870 --> 01:47.300
- I'll see you soon?
- Yeah.

01:47.490 --> 01:50.050
We'll meet here, uh,
day after tomorrow.

01:50.250 --> 01:52.050
But you call me
if you need anything, okay?

01:52.250 --> 01:53.690
Yeah, sure.

02:04.410 --> 02:07.060
[Agnes] See?
So, here, me and my friends

02:07.260 --> 02:09.650
are all little crew mates
on this spaceship together,

02:09.850 --> 02:11.490
- and we're all running around...
- [chuckles softly]

02:11.690 --> 02:13.240
...just completing different tasks.

02:13.440 --> 02:15.820
Except one of us
is secretly an imposter.

02:16.020 --> 02:18.380
Sabotaging the mission.
This is ingenious.

02:18.630 --> 02:21.500
Mmm-hmm.
But Madison totally sold me out last game.

02:21.700 --> 02:23.080
[horn honks]

02:23.280 --> 02:24.290
Agnes, your ride.

02:24.490 --> 02:25.370
[cellphone chimes]

02:25.570 --> 02:26.730
Bye, Pinkie.

02:28.350 --> 02:29.440
Bye, Pops.

02:34.650 --> 02:35.780
Mmm.

02:36.740 --> 02:39.100
Remember when
foursquare and tetherball

02:39.300 --> 02:41.310
were the pinnacle of playtime?

02:41.510 --> 02:43.810
Now they have virtual spaceships.

02:44.010 --> 02:45.700
[vehicle door closes]

02:45.910 --> 02:47.580
[vehicle departs]

02:49.000 --> 02:52.240
Oh, for goodness' sake, Harold.
You're angry. I understand.

02:52.430 --> 02:56.450
You murdered Wujing
and Zhang Wei in the Post Office.

02:56.650 --> 02:57.950
You brought an army there.

02:58.150 --> 03:01.120
You used a stolen NSA tool
to delete government records.

03:01.320 --> 03:02.750
Well, when you put it like that...

03:02.950 --> 03:05.120
"Angry" doesn't begin to cover it.

03:05.320 --> 03:07.000
I understand.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.380
What you've done, Raymond--

03:08.580 --> 03:09.750
I would do again in a heartbeat.

03:09.950 --> 03:11.420
[Cooper] We hunted Wujing
for months.

03:11.620 --> 03:13.340
At a steep cost to the U.S. government.

03:13.540 --> 03:15.300
We put people's lives
on the line.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.050
And the FBI has nothing
to show for it,

03:17.250 --> 03:19.350
- save for a few minor arrests.
- Uh-huh.

03:19.540 --> 03:20.970
We are not a hit squad!

03:21.170 --> 03:25.100
Wujing, Zhang Wei,
Alban Veseli, all dead.

03:25.300 --> 03:27.100
Perillos is gone, I assume dead.

03:27.300 --> 03:29.230
Bo Chang is in the wind.

03:29.430 --> 03:31.980
- Right.
- This won't end here.

03:32.180 --> 03:33.900
An official investigation
hasn't come down

03:34.100 --> 03:36.030
from Main Justice yet,
but when it does,

03:36.230 --> 03:38.610
how do I explain to them
why this task force

03:38.810 --> 03:39.880
should continue to exist?

03:40.340 --> 03:44.300
There's never been a fixed paradigm
for how we operate, Harold.

03:45.140 --> 03:47.370
What the task force was
on its first day

03:47.570 --> 03:51.090
was different than
what it was on its second.

03:51.280 --> 03:53.480
Or third or tenth.

03:54.190 --> 03:56.550
And different from what it is today.

03:56.750 --> 03:59.590
All I can say is,

03:59.790 --> 04:01.680
the danger that
Marvin Gerard unleashed,

04:01.880 --> 04:02.930
it's done.

04:03.130 --> 04:04.530
Criminals are dead.

04:05.450 --> 04:08.190
My connection to the FBI
has been erased.

04:08.390 --> 04:10.650
As we've changed course
many times before,

04:10.850 --> 04:11.940
we're changing course again.

04:12.140 --> 04:13.270
It is what it is.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.250
That's what I tell
the Department of Justice?

04:15.710 --> 04:17.700
Cynthia Panabaker? Congress?

04:17.890 --> 04:19.160
"It is what it is"?

04:19.350 --> 04:21.740
[chuckling] I don't know
what to tell you, Harold.

04:21.940 --> 04:25.660
If you choose
not to continue with me, I understand.

04:25.860 --> 04:29.430
But if you wish to carry on,
keep everyone working...

04:30.140 --> 04:31.420
I have a case.

04:31.620 --> 04:33.750
This situation will not
just go away, Raymond.

04:33.950 --> 04:37.060
Okay, well, tomorrow
can worry about itself.

04:38.070 --> 04:41.180
But this morning,
there was a horrific shooting

04:41.380 --> 04:43.470
at the Sussex State Prison in Virginia.

04:43.670 --> 04:46.560
A leader of El Calavera crime syndicate

04:46.760 --> 04:49.060
took down three rival gang members

04:49.260 --> 04:51.440
and a couple of unlucky bystanders,

04:51.640 --> 04:52.690
one of them a guard.

04:52.890 --> 04:54.610
The prisoner had a gun?

04:54.810 --> 04:56.530
A Glock. Automatic.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.950
My associate Paulie Diamond
was shot in the hip.

05:00.150 --> 05:02.700
Decent thief. Fantastic chess player.

05:02.900 --> 05:05.450
We played through the mail
for years.

05:05.650 --> 05:07.870
Now the fate of my bishop
is in limbo.

05:08.070 --> 05:10.210
How does a prisoner
get an automatic pistol?

05:10.410 --> 05:11.870
The authorities don't seem to know.

05:12.070 --> 05:14.540
It didn't come in through
the usual pipelines.

05:14.740 --> 05:17.520
I believe it to be
the work of The Postman.

05:18.900 --> 05:21.760
I already regret this.
But who is that?

05:21.960 --> 05:23.360
I'm thrilled you asked.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.640
He's a smuggler
of prison contraband.

05:26.840 --> 05:29.890
In a very short time,
he's almost completely dominated

05:30.090 --> 05:31.810
in the Mid-Atlantic market.

05:32.010 --> 05:34.150
We crossed the globe
trying to stop Wujing.

05:34.350 --> 05:36.730
Now you want us to hunt down
a local black-market courier?

05:36.930 --> 05:38.150
What's the angle, Reddington?

05:38.350 --> 05:42.990
The angle is he's rising fast,
spilling blood, making headlines.

05:43.190 --> 05:45.910
If you are so anxious
to prove your worth

05:46.110 --> 05:47.660
to the Department of Justice,

05:47.860 --> 05:51.210
deliver The Postman now,
before he goes national.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.670
"The Postman."
Does he have a real name?

05:53.870 --> 05:56.890
I believe his birth name
is Lawrence Nelson.

05:57.770 --> 06:01.300
I maintain we can still
do good work together, Harold.

06:01.500 --> 06:05.490
And it can start with bringing
Lawrence Nelson to justice.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.100
Today, we'll be
determining the verdict

06:11.300 --> 06:14.230
of the State of Maryland
vs. Lawrence Nelson.

06:14.430 --> 06:17.110
We'll begin by taking
a preliminary, anonymous vote

06:17.310 --> 06:18.900
to see where we all stand.

06:19.100 --> 06:20.990
It's been a long trial.

06:21.180 --> 06:24.250
Hopefully we can be efficient
in our deliberation.

06:24.710 --> 06:26.410
I knew kids growing up
like Lawrence Nelson.

06:26.610 --> 06:28.220
I don't think there's much to discuss.

06:29.010 --> 06:30.290
I've been praying.

06:30.490 --> 06:32.370
His soul will find salvation
in jail.

06:32.570 --> 06:34.010
I know it.

06:45.610 --> 06:49.010
Um, we have 11 votes for "guilty"

06:49.210 --> 06:51.310
and one vote for "not guilty."

06:51.510 --> 06:53.560
Who in the hell thinks
that kid's innocent?

06:53.760 --> 06:56.580
We can keep it anonymous
for the time being.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.020
N-No, I'd love to know
'cause they sure

06:59.220 --> 07:01.070
weren't sitting in
the same courtroom as I was.

07:01.270 --> 07:03.320
Perhaps they're confused or asleep.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.050
- Sir!
- It's okay.

07:05.460 --> 07:07.030
I voted "not guilty."

07:07.230 --> 07:08.530
Right.

07:08.730 --> 07:10.410
Well, thank you for being
for being forthcoming,

07:10.610 --> 07:11.830
um, Juror Number--

07:12.030 --> 07:13.260
Harold.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.600
My name's Harold Cooper.

07:16.180 --> 07:17.980
[jurors murmuring]

07:21.600 --> 07:24.310
[Cooper] Prisoners call him
"The Postman."

07:24.570 --> 07:27.050
Served 25 years in a Maryland prison

07:27.250 --> 07:29.010
starting at 18 years old.

07:29.210 --> 07:32.360
Was released five years ago
on good behavior, then he vanished.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.620
No one's seen him,
including his P.O.

07:34.950 --> 07:36.390
Twenty-five years. Why?

07:36.590 --> 07:37.810
[Cooper] First-degree murder.

07:38.010 --> 07:39.650
He shot his manager
at their workplace,

07:39.850 --> 07:41.520
a convenience store in Baltimore.

07:41.720 --> 07:44.320
I'm sorry, but w-we're gonna
hunt down the local kingpin

07:44.520 --> 07:46.700
of prison contraband because what,

07:46.900 --> 07:48.070
he injured one of
Reddington's cronies?

07:48.270 --> 07:50.240
What about the people
that Reddington killed

07:50.440 --> 07:51.910
in this very room just last week?

07:52.110 --> 07:54.120
Reddington's actions
with respect to Wujing

07:54.320 --> 07:55.790
were frustrating,
I know.

07:55.990 --> 07:57.620
They will be dealt with
in due time.

07:57.820 --> 08:00.710
Look, I'm not losing sleep
over the loss of evil men,

08:00.910 --> 08:03.750
but Reddington told us
a pack of lies.

08:03.950 --> 08:05.210
Why should we believe him

08:05.410 --> 08:07.900
that the Postman is even
worthy of our attention?

08:08.280 --> 08:09.930
Because Larry Nelson's
a dangerous man.

08:10.130 --> 08:11.550
And that doesn't come
from Reddington.

08:11.750 --> 08:12.970
That comes from me.

08:13.170 --> 08:15.180
In Pennsylvania,
Nelson outfitted

08:15.380 --> 08:17.730
an entire cellblock
with Wi-Fi routers,

08:17.930 --> 08:20.230
allowing imprisoned
cartel members to complete drug deals

08:20.430 --> 08:22.310
from the comfort of their prison cell.

08:22.510 --> 08:24.480
And this morning,
five men at Sussex

08:24.680 --> 08:26.440
were shot by Lu Fernan,

08:26.640 --> 08:29.110
the leader of the La Calavera
crime syndicate.

08:29.310 --> 08:33.120
Not only is Nelson making life
more dangerous inside prisons,

08:33.320 --> 08:34.990
that danger is spilling out
to the rest of the world,

08:35.190 --> 08:37.770
- and we have no--
- [video beeping]

08:37.970 --> 08:39.670
<i>Hey, sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.</i>

08:39.860 --> 08:40.960
<i>Hi. It's me. Hello.</i>

08:41.160 --> 08:43.040
<i>Um, did I miss anything?</i>
<i>What did I miss?</i>

08:43.240 --> 08:45.920
Just your first morning
of your trial employment period.

08:46.120 --> 08:48.570
Is he videoconferencing
from home?

08:49.020 --> 08:50.180
You can do that?

08:50.380 --> 08:51.800
<i>Sue's got some sort</i>
<i>of stomach bug.</i>

08:52.000 --> 08:53.550
<i>Um, we... We gave her</i>
<i>this new brand of peaches.</i>

08:53.750 --> 08:56.020
<i>Maybe that was it, but, oh...</i>

08:56.210 --> 08:59.060
<i>Whatever's coming out of her</i>
<i>is not peach-colored.</i>

08:59.260 --> 09:00.990
[Cooper] Herbie,
I would recommend fluids

09:01.250 --> 09:03.060
and a call to your
pediatrician's office.

09:03.260 --> 09:04.730
In the meantime,
Malik and Ressler

09:04.930 --> 09:06.980
are about to roll out
to Sussex State Prison.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.670
Dembe will get you
up to speed as to why.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.330
[Ressler] So, how did you
get the weapon inside?

09:17.530 --> 09:19.040
We know it wasn't a guard.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.000
You could grease every palm
from here to Rikers,

09:21.200 --> 09:24.290
and a guard wouldn't
walk into a cellblock and hand over a gun.

09:24.490 --> 09:25.750
It must've been a little bird.

09:25.950 --> 09:27.940
Hmm. Maybe it was the Postman.

09:28.480 --> 09:31.430
[chuckles] Didn't think
I'd hear that name.

09:31.620 --> 09:33.780
Tell us how you two communicate.

09:33.980 --> 09:36.950
Or what? You gonna lock me up
for a long time?

09:37.160 --> 09:38.720
I rat on that guy,
and he's gonna put a...

09:38.920 --> 09:41.980
A grenade in my soup or
a rattlesnake under my pillow.

09:42.180 --> 09:44.360
He can get anything to anyone
for the right price.

09:44.550 --> 09:46.070
So you're afraid of him.

09:46.260 --> 09:47.460
Wouldn't you be?

09:48.040 --> 09:51.240
I got a syndicate to run from
inside this prison here, okay?

09:51.440 --> 09:52.750
Best of luck.

10:01.760 --> 10:03.470
[groans]

10:07.520 --> 10:09.190
[keypad dialing]

10:13.860 --> 10:15.400
[cellphone rings]

10:18.740 --> 10:20.980
[Eugene] <i>The compound</i>
<i>isn't pure enough.</i>

10:21.170 --> 10:24.140
To get this right,
I need one more delivery.

10:24.340 --> 10:27.020
Eugene. Ever the perfectionist.

10:27.220 --> 10:29.150
Shouldn't you be in bed?

10:29.350 --> 10:30.610
[man on loudspeaker]
<i>Lights out, 9:00 p.m.</i>

10:30.810 --> 10:32.030
- [buzzer sounds]
- [cell doors slam]

10:32.230 --> 10:33.700
I need more product.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.470
I'll send Rudolph. Tomorrow.

10:37.420 --> 10:38.510
I'll oversee it myself.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.580
[phone snaps shut]

10:40.780 --> 10:42.140
[man] Let's get a move on!

11:06.290 --> 11:07.900
[Ressler] We interviewed
inmates at three of the prisons

11:08.100 --> 11:10.000
where Reddington believes
the Postman operates.

11:10.330 --> 11:11.440
No one will talk.

11:11.640 --> 11:14.740
So no leads on the Postman's
mysterious delivery network?

11:14.940 --> 11:17.360
Sussex transferred us
a huge cache of security footage,

11:17.560 --> 11:19.280
but it's gonna take manpower
to get through.

11:19.480 --> 11:21.040
I'm going to assign the task
to Herbie.

11:21.230 --> 11:23.200
Good. Do we have any
other avenues to pursue?

11:23.400 --> 11:25.710
Yeah, Lu Fernan
clearly has confederates

11:25.910 --> 11:27.210
working for him on the outside,

11:27.410 --> 11:29.040
and one of them
must've paid for that gun,

11:29.240 --> 11:30.960
so we checked
his log of visitors...

11:31.160 --> 11:33.340
And it turns out
Fernan's brother moved $10,000

11:33.540 --> 11:35.130
just three days
before the attack.

11:35.330 --> 11:36.760
[Siya] The payment went
to a shell company

11:36.960 --> 11:39.430
which has an account at
Acordia Bank in New Jersey.

11:39.630 --> 11:40.990
It's a regional outfit.

11:41.190 --> 11:44.100
We've contacted them,
but they've been very... cold.

11:44.300 --> 11:47.290
I'll reach out to Reddington.
He may be able to warm them up.

11:51.670 --> 11:54.230
- [cellphone buzzes]
- Cooper.

11:54.430 --> 11:56.150
[Reddington] Apologies
for the missed call.

11:56.350 --> 12:00.030
I just returned
to the creature comforts of the Big Apple.

12:00.230 --> 12:01.370
Anything urgent?

12:01.570 --> 12:04.540
Yes. Do you know anyone
at Acordia Bank in New Jersey?

12:04.740 --> 12:06.370
Lawrence Nelson may
have an account there.

12:06.570 --> 12:10.540
Ah. I'm glad you judged him
a worthy target, Harold.

12:10.740 --> 12:13.980
I'll darken some doorways,
see what I find.

12:14.180 --> 12:15.690
Mmm-hmm.

12:17.230 --> 12:18.690
<i>Is everything alright?</i>

12:18.940 --> 12:20.970
You sound a little...
distracted.

12:21.170 --> 12:23.100
It's just that someone
from my past

12:23.300 --> 12:24.970
has suddenly
popped out of the woodwork.

12:25.170 --> 12:27.020
Ghosts like to do that,
don't they?

12:27.220 --> 12:28.980
Pop out of the woodwork.

12:29.180 --> 12:30.560
I hope it's a friendly one.

12:30.760 --> 12:33.040
This one's definitely not that.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.040
- Let us know about the bank.
- [phone beeps]

12:39.460 --> 12:41.030
I'm not saying he's innocent.

12:41.230 --> 12:42.920
I'm just unconvinced of his guilt.

12:43.510 --> 12:45.700
You're honestly claiming
reasonable doubt?

12:45.900 --> 12:47.870
I don't know.
That's why we're here.

12:48.070 --> 12:51.000
Okay, fine. Can we establish the facts
we all can agree on?

12:51.200 --> 12:53.250
- Sure.
- So, this young kid, Larry,

12:53.450 --> 12:54.880
he's on trial for murdering his manager

12:55.080 --> 12:56.510
at the convenience store
where he worked.

12:56.700 --> 12:59.230
A day before the murder,
she fired him.

12:59.520 --> 13:00.840
- You agree?
- Yes.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.720
The following night,
she was found dead in her car.

13:03.920 --> 13:05.640
She was parked
outside the store.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.180
One shot to the head.

13:07.380 --> 13:10.790
Cash stolen from her wallet...
and Nelson's DNA on the purse.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.940
So we have motive,
we have evidence.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.650
But DNA testing is still quite
a new forensics technique.

13:15.850 --> 13:17.320
[Furor Four]
It's not that complicated.

13:17.520 --> 13:18.940
There's either DNA or there's not.

13:19.140 --> 13:21.920
It's not complicated
because you want to go home.

13:23.050 --> 13:24.320
Okay. What about this?

13:24.520 --> 13:26.180
Two days ago, his girlfriend
swore on a Bible,

13:26.380 --> 13:27.870
took the stand,
and told us that Lawrence Nelson

13:28.070 --> 13:29.660
privately confessed to the murder.

13:29.860 --> 13:31.330
- How do you explain that?
- He is insistent

13:31.530 --> 13:33.290
that conversation
never happened with her.

13:33.490 --> 13:35.750
And he's obviously lying!
We don't need to sit around

13:35.950 --> 13:37.460
talking for hours
to figure that out.

13:37.660 --> 13:40.130
I'm sorry, but I won't
destroy this kid's life

13:40.330 --> 13:41.690
because I'm in a hurry.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.180
Let's start from the beginning.

13:44.380 --> 13:46.700
Can we see the diagram
of the crime scene again?

13:48.280 --> 13:49.870
[golf crowd applauding lightly]

13:50.950 --> 13:51.990
- [club strikes ball]
- [knocking on door]

13:52.620 --> 13:54.520
Sorry, sir. We're closed.

13:54.720 --> 13:57.150
Yes, Benny, I'm aware.
That's why I'm here now.

13:57.350 --> 13:59.650
I'm in search of information

13:59.850 --> 14:02.570
regarding one of your
personal banking clients.

14:02.770 --> 14:03.860
Lawrence Nelson.

14:04.060 --> 14:05.370
And who are you exactly?

14:05.570 --> 14:06.830
Perhaps a new friend.

14:07.030 --> 14:09.450
My name is Raymond Reddington.

14:09.650 --> 14:10.540
Oh.

14:10.740 --> 14:13.330
Benny, your colleagues
left ages ago,

14:13.530 --> 14:16.000
and you're here, what,
watching golf?

14:16.200 --> 14:17.380
Why aren't you at home?

14:17.580 --> 14:19.250
I like the peace and quiet,

14:19.450 --> 14:20.880
which you are currently disturbing.

14:21.080 --> 14:22.590
I can only imagine.

14:22.790 --> 14:24.510
My heart goes out to you, Benny.

14:24.710 --> 14:26.930
You and your Erica... yeah,

14:27.130 --> 14:29.640
only just got married last year?

14:29.840 --> 14:31.480
I bet it hasn't been easy

14:31.670 --> 14:35.020
with your elderly mother-in-law
moving in, has it?

14:35.220 --> 14:38.500
And Laurel's quite
a piece of work, isn't she?

14:38.710 --> 14:41.030
- How do you know?
- Now, I happen to be

14:41.230 --> 14:43.110
very close associates with Rick Bruckner.

14:43.310 --> 14:44.570
Do you know Rick?

14:44.770 --> 14:46.780
Along with a hefty portfolio

14:46.980 --> 14:49.950
of rehabilitation
and retirement facilities,

14:50.150 --> 14:54.790
Rick also happens to own
the Golden Glen Assisted Living Home.

14:54.990 --> 14:56.670
I'm sure you've done
your research,

14:56.870 --> 15:00.590
and you know it's a very exclusive,
very expensive place.

15:00.790 --> 15:03.550
I tell Rick all the time
he's running a racket.

15:03.750 --> 15:06.970
He and I used to bet
on the horses in Dubai.

15:07.170 --> 15:09.970
Truth be told, I fronted Rick
some spending money

15:10.170 --> 15:13.270
after he lost quite a bundle
to the Sultan of Sharjah.

15:13.470 --> 15:15.640
But I know for a fact

15:15.840 --> 15:19.230
Rick would happily find a spot
for Laurel at Golden Glen

15:19.430 --> 15:23.900
at a much reduced rate
if I were to ask on your behalf.

15:24.100 --> 15:28.920
And I can assure you,
Laurel will be <i>so </i>comfortable.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.330
Benny. Are you following?

15:33.530 --> 15:35.580
Laurel's moving to Dubai?

15:35.780 --> 15:37.460
Oh, dear.

15:37.660 --> 15:39.330
Hey. Stop. What...
What are you doing?

15:39.530 --> 15:41.550
Honestly, friendship has its limits.

15:41.740 --> 15:44.720
Now, give me your records
pertaining to Lawrence Nelson,

15:44.910 --> 15:46.780
or I'm gonna
blow out your kneecap.

15:48.860 --> 15:50.780
[knocking on door]

15:55.330 --> 15:56.810
Hey. Come in. Come on in.

15:57.010 --> 15:58.830
Sue's asleep.
She's feeling much better.

15:59.030 --> 16:02.900
Uh, PB&J, bananas and mayo,
or roast beef? It's halal.

16:03.100 --> 16:04.610
[chuckles]
Thank you, Herbie.

16:04.810 --> 16:06.110
Where's the rest of the gang?

16:06.310 --> 16:07.740
I made enough for everyone.

16:07.940 --> 16:10.030
Raymond assessed Nelson's
financial transactions

16:10.230 --> 16:11.780
and ID'd someone
who works for him,

16:11.980 --> 16:14.200
so Malik and Ressler are
following up on that lead.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.000
Okay, well, then I guess
I'll make this snappy,

16:16.200 --> 16:18.560
if you want to just
come over here.

16:19.930 --> 16:23.340
So, I've been eyeballs-deep
analyzing the security footage

16:23.540 --> 16:25.480
from outside Lu Fernan's prison cell.

16:25.690 --> 16:27.590
We know that Tuesday night
his cell was searched,

16:27.790 --> 16:29.890
because that's protocol,
and they found zilch.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.970
And the shooting took place
the next morning, correct?

16:32.170 --> 16:34.100
Right. So the question is,

16:34.300 --> 16:36.310
how'd he get the gun
if he never left his cell?

16:36.510 --> 16:37.890
I don't know.

16:38.090 --> 16:39.140
That's the thing.

16:39.340 --> 16:41.230
It's not what you see.
It's what you hear.

16:41.430 --> 16:43.820
Sussex records audio
on their CCTV cameras,

16:44.020 --> 16:46.190
so I listened to the night
leading up to the shooting

16:46.390 --> 16:47.630
over and over.

16:47.960 --> 16:49.570
I isolated and enhanced sound

16:49.770 --> 16:53.620
using a piece
of audio software, and listen to this.

16:53.820 --> 16:55.870
[whirring]

16:56.070 --> 16:58.040
What was that?

16:58.240 --> 17:00.290
A power line?
A very big fly?

17:00.490 --> 17:02.390
- Close. Watch.
- [beeps]

17:03.730 --> 17:05.150
[whirring]

17:06.770 --> 17:07.810
A drone.

17:08.690 --> 17:09.930
He's using drones.

17:10.120 --> 17:13.510
Yep. The Postman is using drones.

17:13.710 --> 17:14.850
[Dembe]
And no guards saw it?

17:15.050 --> 17:16.560
[Herbie] Based on that audio,
the one he's flying

17:16.760 --> 17:18.640
is incredibly quiet, likely custom-made.

17:18.840 --> 17:19.950
Really cool.

17:20.910 --> 17:22.410
But bad. Cool and bad.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.400
<i>I would think that prisons</i>
<i>have gotten wise</i>

17:25.600 --> 17:28.070
<i>to this type of smuggling,</i>
<i>but a drone like the one he designed,</i>

17:28.270 --> 17:30.250
<i>that quiet, that would be</i>
<i>really hard to detect.</i>

17:33.300 --> 17:35.910
And I would bet you
a roast-beef sandwich

17:36.110 --> 17:37.950
that if you went to
Lu Fernan's prison cell,

17:38.150 --> 17:39.850
you would see
that his window's been tampered with.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.360
Steady. Steady.

17:49.900 --> 17:53.150
This is one delivery
we cannot afford to drop.

17:59.070 --> 18:00.410
[whirring softly]

18:10.000 --> 18:11.340
Excellent.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.450
[sighs]

18:18.650 --> 18:21.370
[door opens and closes]

18:21.570 --> 18:23.330
Thanks for coming in
to speak with us, Gina.

18:23.530 --> 18:25.380
The four federal agents
who showed up on my doorstep

18:25.580 --> 18:27.340
didn't give me the impression
I had a choice.

18:27.540 --> 18:30.260
Hmm. So what can you tell me
about Lawrence Nelson?

18:30.450 --> 18:32.400
I never met a Lawrence Nelson.

18:33.480 --> 18:36.760
Two days ago, an inmate
shot up a prison with an automatic pistol.

18:36.960 --> 18:38.930
Now, we traced the payment
for that pistol

18:39.130 --> 18:40.970
to a bank account
belonging to Nelson.

18:41.170 --> 18:42.600
Now, there are
multiple payments

18:42.800 --> 18:45.480
directly from his
bank account into yours.

18:45.680 --> 18:46.560
Okay.

18:46.760 --> 18:47.690
[door opens]

18:47.890 --> 18:50.290
- Hi, Gina.
- [door closes]

18:50.580 --> 18:52.990
We actually have Nelson
in custody.

18:53.190 --> 18:54.570
She might as well know.

18:54.770 --> 18:57.450
Nelson just told us
that you run the operation,

18:57.650 --> 18:59.450
that you communicate
with the prisoners

18:59.650 --> 19:00.990
and operate the drones

19:01.190 --> 19:03.460
and that you call yourself
"The Postman."

19:03.650 --> 19:05.870
The who? What are you
talking about?

19:06.070 --> 19:07.210
Smuggling contraband.

19:07.410 --> 19:08.560
With drones?

19:09.230 --> 19:10.560
I don't know the first thing
about drones.

19:11.230 --> 19:12.760
Look. I wasn't lying to you.

19:12.960 --> 19:15.300
I do business with Larry Nelson,
but I've never met him.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.050
Hmm. Clever.

19:17.250 --> 19:19.280
So what kind of business
do you do with Nelson?

19:20.450 --> 19:22.180
Look. You're smart enough
to know how this goes.

19:22.380 --> 19:25.060
You give us something about Nelson,
we do something for you.

19:25.260 --> 19:26.700
Simple as that.

19:29.210 --> 19:30.540
I buy stuff.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.980
He tells me, I buy it.

19:33.180 --> 19:35.360
I was sourcing counterfeit bags
when he recruited me.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.340
Hermes. Louis Vuitton.

19:37.760 --> 19:42.930
But for him, the things I sourced
are much more... varied.

19:43.470 --> 19:46.040
Drugs, weapons, high-tech toys.

19:46.240 --> 19:47.640
A beautiful ukulele once.

19:48.430 --> 19:50.670
I never knew what it was all for.
I never asked.

19:50.870 --> 19:52.800
I was just a middleman.
I'm sure there are others.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.550
So how would you get it to him?

19:54.750 --> 19:57.300
He'd send me
contraband requests with drop locations.

19:57.500 --> 19:58.640
Different places every time.

19:58.830 --> 20:01.560
And you never wondered
what these items were for?

20:01.750 --> 20:03.010
No.

20:03.210 --> 20:05.350
For what he was paying me,
no, I never wondered.

20:05.550 --> 20:06.890
Or cared.

20:07.090 --> 20:08.420
He had so many requests
that I started getting

20:08.620 --> 20:10.410
other people in the bag world
to help me.

20:10.750 --> 20:12.480
We all agreed that
it's way more interesting

20:12.680 --> 20:14.780
to track down a gun
than a Chanel quilted mini.

20:14.980 --> 20:16.240
[chuckles]

20:16.440 --> 20:19.840
But the items he's been
ordering recently? Strange.

20:20.260 --> 20:21.370
Strange in what way?

20:21.570 --> 20:23.050
Like, scientific.

20:23.800 --> 20:26.040
I've been getting chemistry
equipment and chemicals.

20:26.240 --> 20:27.760
Things I have to go to labs for.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.390
I can't pronounce half of it.

20:30.890 --> 20:32.840
I can show you, if you want.

20:33.040 --> 20:34.520
Oh, we insist.

20:37.020 --> 20:38.720
[Cooper] Thank you for agreeing
to meet with me, Warden.

20:38.920 --> 20:42.760
My team is deep into an investigation
of a former inmate of yours.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.060
Right. Lawrence Nelson.

20:44.260 --> 20:45.640
Waiting on getting his case files,

20:45.840 --> 20:48.140
but I wanted
to talk to somebody who remembered him.

20:48.340 --> 20:50.150
Couldn't forget that kid if I tried.

20:50.340 --> 20:52.870
Lawrence Nelson
was bright, hardworking.

20:53.790 --> 20:55.440
Was transferred here
from a pretty tough

20:55.640 --> 20:57.490
high-security prison
for good behavior.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.700
That must've helped him
in front of the parole board.

20:59.900 --> 21:02.620
Oh, yeah. So did
his associate's degree.

21:02.820 --> 21:05.340
He earned it in electrical engineering
while he was here.

21:05.590 --> 21:07.080
Why did he choose that field?

21:07.280 --> 21:10.250
He was inspired
by his cellmate, a chemist.

21:10.450 --> 21:12.130
Brilliant guy. Still here.

21:12.320 --> 21:13.750
Larry hated this place.

21:13.950 --> 21:16.730
Maintained his innocence throughout,
but he used the time well.

21:18.020 --> 21:19.190
Do you think he was innocent?

21:20.610 --> 21:24.280
It's rare that a man would stick
to the same story for 25 years.

21:25.240 --> 21:27.240
If they're guilty,
they usually give up the fight.

21:28.070 --> 21:30.350
But it's easier for me
to believe that he did it.

21:30.550 --> 21:31.600
Why?

21:31.800 --> 21:34.120
Because either way,
he'll never get those 25 years back.

21:37.920 --> 21:39.320
So, you said
you found something?

21:39.520 --> 21:41.660
Yes, I was looking over
the list you sent over,

21:41.850 --> 21:44.490
the items that Gina Abbott
purchased for Larry Nelson?

21:44.690 --> 21:46.080
When I first saw
the chemistry equipment,

21:46.280 --> 21:49.040
I assumed it was some sort of
drug manufacturing operation.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.040
But then I noticed this.

21:51.240 --> 21:52.970
- [clicks and beeps]
- Rosaries.

21:53.600 --> 21:55.420
Rosaries?
As in Catholicism?

21:55.620 --> 21:57.840
Yeah, brought me right back
to Father Phillip telling me

21:58.040 --> 22:00.170
I was going straight to hell
for not using a hall pass.

22:00.370 --> 22:02.550
That's a heavy load to put
on a kid with a small bladder,

22:02.750 --> 22:03.970
especially right before
his bar mitzvah.

22:04.170 --> 22:05.850
- Herbie. Focus.
- Right, yeah.

22:06.050 --> 22:07.640
The... The reason
that the rosaries stood out

22:07.840 --> 22:09.810
is because religious objects
aren't banned in prisons.

22:10.010 --> 22:11.390
So why smuggle them in?

22:11.590 --> 22:13.520
[Herbie] Well, as it turns out,
these aren't just any rosaries.

22:13.720 --> 22:15.310
They're sourced in
the Philippines with beads

22:15.510 --> 22:18.940
made from the seeds
of the <i>abrus precatorius </i>vine.

22:19.140 --> 22:22.240
The rosary pea plant.
And that is bad.

22:22.440 --> 22:23.780
So we're worried about peas?

22:23.980 --> 22:25.410
Oh, yeah, big-time.

22:25.610 --> 22:27.200
The dried peas themselves
aren't dangerous.

22:27.400 --> 22:28.830
They're used in jewelry
all the time.

22:29.030 --> 22:31.200
But one of the most dangerous
toxins on the planet

22:31.400 --> 22:33.710
is extracted from them, abrin.

22:33.910 --> 22:35.330
I've never heard of abrin.

22:35.530 --> 22:36.840
You've heard of ricin,
though, right?

22:37.030 --> 22:39.880
Sure, an old favorite
assassination tool of the KGB.

22:40.080 --> 22:43.380
Well, abrin
is 75 times more lethal and way more rare.

22:43.580 --> 22:44.800
There's no antidote.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.720
If you grind up these seeds
and process them

22:46.920 --> 22:49.060
with sodium hydroxide
and methyl ethyl ketone,

22:49.260 --> 22:52.140
which were both on the Postman's
contraband list, you get abrin.

22:52.340 --> 22:54.980
So Nelson's helping a prisoner
make a deadly toxin?

22:55.180 --> 22:59.440
Yeah, and judging by the orders,
whoever it is, is making a lot of it.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.480
If it were to get into
a food or water supply...

23:01.680 --> 23:03.950
- [Ressler] <i>Or a prison kitchen.</i>
<i>- ...thousands could die.</i>

23:04.150 --> 23:06.030
[Siya] <i>The orders don't</i>
<i>include any destinations.</i>

23:06.230 --> 23:08.240
<i>I didn't see any indication</i>
<i>of what prison</i>

23:08.440 --> 23:09.780
<i>the materials were being sent to.</i>

23:09.980 --> 23:11.160
[Herbie] <i>Me neither, but I did notice</i>

23:11.360 --> 23:13.180
that some of
the order numbers repeat.

23:14.100 --> 23:16.850
They're not order numbers.
They're prisoner numbers.

23:17.680 --> 23:21.300
Prisoner numbers
vary state by state, but all are unique.

23:21.500 --> 23:25.010
<i>This one, for example, 8978-0324.</i>

23:25.210 --> 23:26.630
<i>That's a federal prison number.</i>

23:26.830 --> 23:30.030
The last four digits refer to
the sentencing court's jurisdiction.

23:30.860 --> 23:33.600
And the number assigned
to the rosaries...

23:33.800 --> 23:35.910
[keyboard clacking]

23:36.120 --> 23:38.150
He's sending the rosaries
to a prisoner

23:38.350 --> 23:40.270
at Pittman Correctional Institute.

23:40.470 --> 23:42.920
That's the prison
where the Postman finished his sentence.

23:43.330 --> 23:45.090
And where Cooper is right now.

23:50.840 --> 23:53.080
What's the name of Nelson's
former cellmate, the chemist?

23:53.280 --> 23:54.500
You said he was still here.

23:54.700 --> 23:57.040
Eugene Campos.
Yes, still here. Why?

23:57.240 --> 23:59.920
Put the prison on lockdown now.
We have to talk to him.

24:00.120 --> 24:02.130
He may be in possession
of a chemical-warfare agent.

24:02.330 --> 24:03.510
[guard] Search his cell.

24:03.700 --> 24:04.710
[alarm blaring]

24:04.910 --> 24:06.930
[guards shouting indistinctly]

24:07.120 --> 24:08.900
[handcuffs clicking]

24:12.360 --> 24:13.700
It's gone, isn't it?

24:29.550 --> 24:31.240
[Cooper] We were wrong.
We thought Larry Nelson

24:31.440 --> 24:32.780
was sending materials
into the prison

24:32.980 --> 24:35.790
so abrin could be manufactured
and used inside.

24:35.990 --> 24:37.370
[Siya] But he sent
the materials in

24:37.570 --> 24:39.420
so he could smuggle
the finished toxin <i>out.</i>

24:39.620 --> 24:41.710
Did Nelson's chemist friend
indicate where it was going?

24:41.910 --> 24:43.210
I questioned him.

24:43.410 --> 24:44.960
Eugene confirmed
that he made abrin

24:45.160 --> 24:46.590
using materials Nelson supplied,

24:46.790 --> 24:48.380
but he refused to say
for whom or why.

24:48.580 --> 24:50.590
And we don't have time
for him to change his mind.

24:50.790 --> 24:52.640
I took a peek at the evidence
from Eugene's cell.

24:52.840 --> 24:55.060
From the residue, it looks like
he was grinding the abrin

24:55.260 --> 24:56.770
down into a very fine powder,

24:56.970 --> 24:59.100
which you would really only do
if you wanted to aerosolize it.

24:59.300 --> 25:00.770
And with this guy's
engineering ability...

25:00.970 --> 25:02.650
He could create a chemical weapon.

25:02.850 --> 25:04.480
Abrin is bad enough when ingested,

25:04.680 --> 25:06.400
but if it's inhaled,
that's a whole different story.

25:06.600 --> 25:07.900
It's bleeding from the nose,

25:08.100 --> 25:10.240
fluid in the lungs,
respiratory failure, death.

25:10.440 --> 25:12.410
So the only question is,
where is it headed?

25:12.610 --> 25:13.780
Maybe he's selling it.

25:13.980 --> 25:15.330
I'll see what Reddington has to offer.

25:15.530 --> 25:18.160
In the meantime,
put out an APB for Nelson.

25:18.360 --> 25:21.270
Coordinate with local PD
and set up a perimeter.

25:23.640 --> 25:25.590
He's using drones?

25:25.790 --> 25:28.630
Honestly, Harold,
the things people think of

25:28.830 --> 25:30.340
and what they do with the things.

25:30.540 --> 25:32.090
Wish drones were the end of it.

25:32.290 --> 25:34.010
Have you heard of anyone
in your circles

25:34.210 --> 25:35.760
looking to buy a chemical weapon?

25:35.960 --> 25:37.810
Aerosolized abrin, to be specific.

25:38.010 --> 25:39.350
- [knocking on door]
- [Reddington] <i>Abrin?</i>

25:39.550 --> 25:42.900
[chuckles] Oh, my.
I knew some Sri Lankan separatists

25:43.100 --> 25:45.020
who dabbled
with the stuff years ago.

25:45.220 --> 25:46.980
But, well, they're dead.

25:47.180 --> 25:49.610
<i>Abrin? You're sure he's selling it?</i>

25:49.810 --> 25:51.740
Do you think he would use it
for his own means?

25:51.940 --> 25:54.070
You tell me, Harold.
You know Mr. Nelson

25:54.270 --> 25:55.800
much better than I do.

25:58.430 --> 26:01.790
You've known this whole time
that I served on his jury.

26:01.990 --> 26:03.770
It came to my attention.

26:04.390 --> 26:06.130
You know, serving on
Larry Nelson's jury,

26:06.330 --> 26:09.480
that was the first time
I ever sent anyone to prison.

26:10.310 --> 26:11.670
It must've been difficult.

26:11.870 --> 26:13.180
It was.

26:13.380 --> 26:15.180
I was never sure we made
the right decision,

26:15.380 --> 26:17.640
but I guess I don't
have to wonder anymore.

26:17.840 --> 26:19.640
<i>He's unmistakably criminal.</i>

26:19.840 --> 26:22.060
As a man with some
criminal experience,

26:22.260 --> 26:25.690
I can assure you
that sometimes

26:25.890 --> 26:29.960
forces much greater than ourselves
help to lead us to those waters.

26:30.540 --> 26:32.110
Well, regardless
of how he got there,

26:32.310 --> 26:33.740
he's now in possession
of a chemical weapon

26:33.940 --> 26:34.950
that could kill hundreds.

26:35.150 --> 26:36.630
I'll keep you updated.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.160
I recognize that it's improbable,

26:43.360 --> 26:45.170
but maybe there's a reason
his girlfriend

26:45.370 --> 26:47.340
- would've lied about his confession.
- Oh, here we go again.

26:47.530 --> 26:49.000
[young Cooper] She was already
at the police station

26:49.200 --> 26:51.460
for some other reason
when she made the accusation.

26:51.660 --> 26:53.260
And before we send a man
to prison,

26:53.460 --> 26:54.510
I think we should know why.

26:54.710 --> 26:57.050
That information was struck
from the record by the judge.

26:57.250 --> 26:59.320
- We're not to consider it.
- Then what about his alibi?

26:59.950 --> 27:02.060
You really want this kid
to be innocent.

27:02.260 --> 27:05.850
But guess what.
Sometimes people do bad things!

27:06.050 --> 27:07.940
<i>Especially </i>kids from
his neck of the woods.

27:08.140 --> 27:09.440
Trust me. I grew up there.

27:09.640 --> 27:11.320
It's not fair to throw
this kid's life away

27:11.520 --> 27:14.090
because he reminds you of kids
from your high school.

27:14.590 --> 27:15.660
You're putting words
in my mouth.

27:15.850 --> 27:18.870
Larry said he was at a family cabin
near Tuckahoe State Park.

27:19.070 --> 27:20.290
A neighbor saw him there.

27:20.480 --> 27:23.120
But no one can confirm that
he was there at the time of the murder.

27:23.320 --> 27:27.170
And running away to a remote cabin
doesn't really scream "not guilty."

27:27.370 --> 27:29.750
He said he went there
to be alone, to think.

27:29.950 --> 27:32.560
So that's why he was there, alone.

27:32.860 --> 27:36.340
Okay. Okay, okay.
Why don't we take a breather?

27:36.540 --> 27:39.820
And when we get back,
we'll take another vote.

27:41.700 --> 27:42.950
[door slams]

27:43.240 --> 27:44.490
Okay.

27:49.830 --> 27:51.870
Hey. You called?

27:52.210 --> 27:54.460
I've been reading
Lawrence Nelson's old case files.

27:55.130 --> 27:57.450
I found a possible location
to his whereabouts.

27:57.650 --> 27:59.280
Buried in his past.

27:59.480 --> 28:02.310
It's a long shot,
but it's a cabin located

28:02.510 --> 28:05.160
at 1414 Tuckahoe Road.

28:05.360 --> 28:07.180
All right. Malik and I are on it.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.510
[beeps]

29:00.820 --> 29:01.930
Clear.

29:02.130 --> 29:05.700
Herbie was right.
This guy is quite an engineer.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.490
Hey. Come here. Look at this.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.900
These are schematics
for an HVAC system.

29:17.100 --> 29:19.700
He's gonna take out
a whole office building.

29:19.900 --> 29:22.570
It says Baltimore, Maryland,
but there's no address.

29:22.770 --> 29:24.680
So, which building?

29:30.640 --> 29:32.730
[sighs]

29:36.690 --> 29:37.980
Did you serve?

29:38.980 --> 29:42.430
I did. Navy. Finished my service
a little over a year ago.

29:42.630 --> 29:44.930
Ah. I knew it
when I spotted you.

29:45.130 --> 29:47.600
I-It's in the shoulders,
how we carry ourselves.

29:47.800 --> 29:51.640
I myself had the distinct honor
of pushing paper at Fort Shafter.

29:51.840 --> 29:53.100
No kidding. Oahu?

29:53.300 --> 29:54.810
Yeah, yeah, tough gig.

29:55.010 --> 29:56.320
[both chuckle]

29:56.520 --> 29:58.690
Now I work over at
the Baltimore VA now.

29:58.890 --> 30:01.320
- Now, that is a tough gig.
- Yes.

30:01.520 --> 30:03.820
The system leaves
a lot to be desired.

30:04.020 --> 30:05.160
Boy, is that an understatement.

30:05.360 --> 30:06.630
Hmm.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.430
Listen, Cooper.

30:11.010 --> 30:15.290
I can tell you
want him to be innocent, and I understand.

30:15.490 --> 30:19.170
But we both know that decisions
can't be made based on emotion.

30:19.370 --> 30:21.150
I'm just trying to do right by him.

30:21.350 --> 30:22.720
Oh, come on, though.

30:22.920 --> 30:25.600
If he didn't do it
with the evidence as is,

30:25.790 --> 30:28.970
he's got to be the unluckiest
SOB in Baltimore.

30:29.170 --> 30:30.410
Unlucky isn't a crime.

30:32.120 --> 30:35.060
You want to do right by him.
What about her?

30:35.260 --> 30:37.620
- Who?
- The victim. Carrie Baker.

30:38.710 --> 30:40.940
If you really don't believe,
based on evidence,

30:41.140 --> 30:43.320
that he killed that woman
beyond a reasonable doubt,

30:43.520 --> 30:45.590
I respect that.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.160
But we <i>never </i>have
enough information in life.

30:48.360 --> 30:50.700
You consider all the facts
that you have,

30:50.900 --> 30:53.080
and you make
the best choice you can.

30:53.280 --> 30:55.750
That's how you do right by people.

30:55.950 --> 30:58.350
- Hmm.
- You want to save him.

30:59.690 --> 31:00.940
You have it in your eyes.

31:01.730 --> 31:03.670
But you can't save Larry Nelson
from what he's done.

31:03.870 --> 31:05.990
You can't save him from himself.

31:06.940 --> 31:08.510
You served.

31:08.710 --> 31:11.030
And you know
you can't save 'em all.

31:23.040 --> 31:26.760
Please raise your hand
if you believe the defendant is guilty.

31:45.610 --> 31:47.090
[Herbie] Hey. Mr. Cooper?

31:47.290 --> 31:48.760
Here are the rest
of the files the courthouse sent over.

31:48.960 --> 31:50.260
They were sitting outside.

31:50.460 --> 31:53.220
Thank you.
Any update on Malik and Ressler?

31:53.420 --> 31:54.930
Uh, they're still at the cabin.

31:55.130 --> 31:56.230
They sent me scans
of his schematics.

31:56.430 --> 31:58.730
It appears he's targeting
a government building in Baltimore,

31:58.930 --> 32:00.960
but I haven't
narrowed it down from there.

32:01.460 --> 32:03.250
- Thanks, Herbie. Stay on it.
- Yeah.

32:16.970 --> 32:18.270
What the hell?

32:21.350 --> 32:23.980
[cellphone rings]

32:24.730 --> 32:25.800
Ressler.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.970
[Cooper] <i>I think I know</i>
<i>the building that Nelson's targeting.</i>

32:28.170 --> 32:30.180
<i>It's the Attorney General's</i>
<i>office in downtown Baltimore.</i>

32:30.380 --> 32:33.780
It's where the state's Attorney General,
Christopher Jay, is based.

32:40.910 --> 32:43.020
You're gonna drive
directly to the loading dock

32:43.220 --> 32:44.940
of 200 Saint Peter Place.

32:45.140 --> 32:47.400
Before Christopher Jay
was Maryland Attorney General,

32:47.600 --> 32:49.280
he was a city prosecutor who sent

32:49.480 --> 32:51.280
<i>an innocent man away</i>
<i>for 25 years.</i>

32:51.480 --> 32:52.830
[Siya] An innocent man?

32:53.020 --> 32:54.990
You're talking about Nelson?
The Postman?

32:55.190 --> 32:56.660
<i>It's too much</i>
<i>to get into right now,</i>

32:56.860 --> 32:58.830
but I believe that the star
witness in his murder case

32:59.030 --> 33:00.460
all those years ago
was compromised

33:00.660 --> 33:02.290
and that Christopher Jay
let it happen.

33:02.490 --> 33:04.050
If Nelson knows this, too,
then he has a motive

33:04.240 --> 33:06.010
<i>to go after Jay and the people</i>
<i>who work for him.</i>

33:06.200 --> 33:07.260
So it's a revenge play.

33:07.460 --> 33:09.720
<i>Confirm that the</i>
<i>Baltimore AG's office building</i>

33:09.920 --> 33:11.550
matches Nelson's schematics,
and if they do,

33:11.750 --> 33:14.410
<i>call the state police</i>
<i>and pray we're not too late.</i>

33:15.700 --> 33:17.070
Seal it up!

33:23.040 --> 33:26.320
[Cooper] <i>You were right. Larry Nelson</i>
<i>is using the chemical weapon himself.</i>

33:26.520 --> 33:28.070
He's going after the
Maryland Attorney General,

33:28.270 --> 33:29.700
targeting the HVAC system.

33:29.900 --> 33:32.780
Was the Maryland Attorney
General once his prosecutor?

33:32.980 --> 33:34.580
<i>Yes, we've evacuating</i>
<i>the building now,</i>

33:34.780 --> 33:36.040
but we still have a madman

33:36.230 --> 33:37.790
moving through the city
with a bioweapon.

33:37.990 --> 33:40.580
And we have no idea where he is
or what he'll do if he's cornered.

33:40.780 --> 33:43.890
So you have to figure out
how he plans to get the weapon inside.

33:44.560 --> 33:46.500
He can't walk right
into the AG's office.

33:46.700 --> 33:49.670
The only people who work
on the city's pipes and vents

33:49.870 --> 33:52.430
- are Local 4809.
- A union?

33:52.630 --> 33:54.720
<i>Plumbers and Steamfitters Union.</i>

33:54.920 --> 33:58.600
Who knows? Maybe one of them
might help a madman for a buck.

33:58.800 --> 33:59.930
I'll give their offices a call.

34:00.130 --> 34:01.270
<i>I can do you one better.</i>

34:01.470 --> 34:04.620
I happen to know a few of them,
and they cheat at bowling.

34:05.160 --> 34:08.230
I don't know how they do <i>that,</i>
but they do.

34:08.430 --> 34:10.540
[metal thudding]

34:11.000 --> 34:12.960
[wheels rolling]

34:21.050 --> 34:22.770
[thudding]

34:38.780 --> 34:42.160
[SWAT officer]
Hands up! On your knees!

34:51.080 --> 34:52.190
Where the hell am I?

34:52.390 --> 34:54.610
You're in federal custody, Mr. Nelson.

34:54.810 --> 34:56.160
I'm Harold Cooper.

34:56.360 --> 34:59.550
You may not remember me,
but we've met before.

35:12.060 --> 35:15.240
So, Reddington made a call, huh?

35:15.440 --> 35:19.760
Raymond knows Fred Alonso,
boss of Local 4809.

35:19.960 --> 35:22.890
They repair the HVAC systems
in the city of Baltimore.

35:23.090 --> 35:24.640
Alonso tipped off Raymond

35:24.840 --> 35:27.480
as to who might be delivering
the crate to the building.

35:27.680 --> 35:28.940
Raymond's guys
grabbed the vehicle

35:29.140 --> 35:30.360
and had it delivered here.

35:30.560 --> 35:31.440
What about the weapon?

35:31.640 --> 35:33.070
It's being disassembled now.

35:33.270 --> 35:34.900
They wouldn't let me watch,
but hopefully I can

35:35.100 --> 35:37.280
sneak into evidence before
they get rid of the aerosolization tank

35:37.480 --> 35:40.530
'cause, boy, that has got to be
a beautiful piece of engineering.

35:40.730 --> 35:42.290
Well, maybe evidence
will let you keep

35:42.490 --> 35:44.410
one of the drones,
at least.

35:44.610 --> 35:45.790
Wait. Really?

35:45.990 --> 35:47.560
- No.
- [chuckles]

35:50.940 --> 35:52.900
[door opens]

35:58.280 --> 35:59.860
I'm not signing a confession.

36:01.280 --> 36:02.770
It's not a confession.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.520
It's a 30-year-old transcript
of your old girlfriend's

36:05.720 --> 36:07.350
first conversation
with the police

36:07.550 --> 36:09.100
on the night
of Carrie Baker's murder,

36:09.300 --> 36:11.650
the same conversation
that made her the star witness

36:11.850 --> 36:13.070
against you in court.

36:13.270 --> 36:15.780
That transcript should've been
given to your counsel.

36:15.980 --> 36:17.260
It wasn't.

36:17.460 --> 36:19.340
She doesn't mention me.

36:20.340 --> 36:21.590
At all.

36:24.800 --> 36:27.580
The BPD was investigating her
for drug charges.

36:27.780 --> 36:30.130
The fact that she gave them
a story about you

36:30.330 --> 36:32.040
less than 24 hours
after the murder

36:32.240 --> 36:34.630
and that the prosecution
withheld this information

36:34.830 --> 36:37.470
at trial suggests that she may
have testified against you

36:37.670 --> 36:41.300
as part of a quid-pro-quo deal
orchestrated by the prosecutor.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.820
Hmm. She was scared to go to prison.

36:44.200 --> 36:45.620
So she sent me instead.

36:46.830 --> 36:50.440
The prosecutor, Christopher Jay,
he had political ambitions,

36:50.640 --> 36:52.940
wanted to improve
the homicide clearance rate,

36:53.140 --> 36:55.610
so he did what he could.

36:55.810 --> 36:57.880
How are you so familiar
with my case?

37:02.090 --> 37:03.380
I was on your jury.

37:04.510 --> 37:06.260
Oh.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.390
So you fell for her story, too.

37:08.640 --> 37:10.580
I voted to convict
because the evidence

37:10.780 --> 37:12.250
was overwhelmingly against you.

37:12.450 --> 37:14.770
Unlawfully so, it seems.

37:15.270 --> 37:16.610
I'm sorry.

37:17.560 --> 37:18.970
I remember.

37:19.170 --> 37:21.280
You were so adamant then
that you were innocent.

37:21.530 --> 37:24.150
Well, I was telling the truth.

37:27.280 --> 37:29.160
We have to hold you accountable
for your new crimes.

37:30.910 --> 37:33.190
Still, I'm gonna do
everything I can

37:33.390 --> 37:36.980
to have the original crime
expunged from your record.

37:37.180 --> 37:39.880
And I'm going to try
to hold Christopher Jay accountable, too.

37:41.090 --> 37:43.300
What difference does it make now?

37:44.800 --> 37:46.470
It makes all the difference.

37:48.100 --> 37:50.040
Hey, congrats on
your first case, Herbie.

37:50.240 --> 37:53.460
Thank you. Anyone want
to go out, celebrate?

37:53.660 --> 37:55.960
- What were you thinking?
- I know a great bar nearby.

37:56.160 --> 37:57.380
I mean, I'm not
drinking right now.

37:57.580 --> 37:58.880
I have to stay sharp
for a tournament,

37:59.080 --> 38:00.720
but this place has
a really good table.

38:00.920 --> 38:02.760
Maybe you guys would be down
for a little casual game?

38:02.960 --> 38:04.260
I'm sorry.
Are you talking about--

38:04.460 --> 38:06.100
Foosball, yes.
Yes, I am.

38:06.300 --> 38:09.180
I'm sorry. I got a phone call
I got to deal with.

38:09.380 --> 38:11.890
Thank you so much,
but I got, like, laundry to do.

38:12.090 --> 38:13.440
All right. No. I totally get it.

38:13.640 --> 38:15.150
It's not for everybody.
Don't worry about it.

38:15.350 --> 38:16.650
I'll go with you, Herbie.

38:16.850 --> 38:18.280
- What? Really?
- Yes. Why not?

38:18.480 --> 38:19.820
I like soccer.

38:20.020 --> 38:21.260
Why not soccer on a table?

38:21.460 --> 38:22.820
Exactly. Yes.

38:23.020 --> 38:25.120
And just like soccer,
it is deeply technical

38:25.320 --> 38:27.080
and has a growing fan base
in America.

38:27.280 --> 38:29.800
Also, by the way,
it dates back to the 1890s.

38:34.270 --> 38:35.750
Hey. I just got your message.

38:35.950 --> 38:37.380
What's, uh...
What's going on?

38:37.580 --> 38:40.440
Yeah, yeah, it's... It's...
It's been, um...

38:41.900 --> 38:43.150
Not good.

38:43.730 --> 38:45.820
It's okay. It's all part of it.

38:46.900 --> 38:49.060
You know, the thing about,
um, being back in the world

38:49.260 --> 38:51.560
is that, um,
people are watching you.

38:51.760 --> 38:53.140
You may be doing better,

38:53.340 --> 38:56.160
but everybody's expecting you
to mess up, so...

38:57.870 --> 38:59.880
Why not get it over with?

39:01.710 --> 39:03.170
My dealer called.

39:04.050 --> 39:07.300
I blocked his number,
but he got a new phone, and, um...

39:07.590 --> 39:11.300
Just hearing his voice,
it brought me back.

39:13.310 --> 39:15.640
Figured it was gonna
happen anyway, so...

39:18.100 --> 39:19.190
Hmm.

39:26.900 --> 39:28.640
Don, you realize
you just destroyed $400?

39:28.840 --> 39:31.640
And I'll do it again
the next time you call.

39:31.840 --> 39:33.270
And the time after that.

39:33.470 --> 39:35.910
So stop wasting your money.

39:36.830 --> 39:37.810
Excuse me.

39:38.010 --> 39:39.150
Would you mind
clearing these

39:39.350 --> 39:40.860
and getting us
another round of coffee?

39:41.060 --> 39:42.500
Thank you.

39:43.790 --> 39:46.610
We're gonna wait here
until the meeting tonight, okay?

39:46.810 --> 39:49.050
I'm not going anywhere,
and neither are you.

39:57.020 --> 39:58.480
[video call ringing]

40:00.810 --> 40:02.310
- [beeps]
- Whoa!

40:02.600 --> 40:04.210
I didn't know you knew
how to video call!

40:04.410 --> 40:07.340
[chuckles] <i>No.</i>
<i>My friend Herbie walked me through it.</i>

40:07.540 --> 40:10.300
- Did you open the gift?
- What gift?

40:10.500 --> 40:14.070
Well, there should be
a delivery man on your porch right now.

40:14.280 --> 40:15.660
<i>Hold on!</i>

40:17.790 --> 40:19.200
[door opens]

40:25.670 --> 40:29.010
Now, I know that a lot
of people today are partial

40:29.210 --> 40:31.160
to games with animation,

40:31.360 --> 40:33.740
lights, colors, and sounds.

40:33.940 --> 40:36.710
But this will make you better
at all of them.

40:36.910 --> 40:38.310
Madison doesn't stand a chance.

40:38.720 --> 40:41.170
[gasps] <i>Oh, my gosh!</i>

40:41.370 --> 40:43.170
<i>It's so cute!</i>

40:43.370 --> 40:45.440
[laughs] Yeah.
I thought it was cute.

40:48.190 --> 40:51.720
But, Pinkie...
I have no idea how to play.

40:51.920 --> 40:53.510
Well, I'm down a chess partner,

40:53.710 --> 40:56.100
and I thought
I could teach you. But you'll beat me.

40:56.300 --> 40:57.940
<i>- Yes, I'll trounce you.</i>
- [door closes]

40:58.130 --> 41:01.310
<i>It'll be very dispiriting,</i>
<i>but not for me, of course.</i>

41:01.510 --> 41:03.520
<i>But here's the thing about chess.</i>

41:03.720 --> 41:07.490
<i>You and your opponent have</i>
<i>the exact same information.</i>

41:07.690 --> 41:09.110
<i>No one is hiding anything.</i>

41:09.310 --> 41:12.550
Everything is right there
on the board and in your head.

41:13.720 --> 41:15.260
<i>I don't know, Agnes.</i>

41:16.140 --> 41:18.870
<i>Even when you think</i>
<i>it's all laid out for you,</i>

41:19.070 --> 41:21.060
<i>Pinkie can be very tricky.</i>

41:21.270 --> 41:23.960
<i>You'll not just have to</i>
<i>think several steps ahead.</i>

41:24.160 --> 41:26.050
<i>You'll be replaying</i>
<i>every move you made</i>

41:26.250 --> 41:27.860
<i>since you began the game.</i>

41:28.770 --> 41:30.590
<i>Playing against him</i>
<i>will make you sharper,</i>

41:30.790 --> 41:33.300
<i>and since this is</i>
<i>practically math homework,</i>

41:33.500 --> 41:35.320
<i>you can play for a little.</i>

41:35.990 --> 41:39.640
<i>Excellent! Okay.</i>
<i>So, let's get you set up.</i>

41:39.840 --> 41:41.650
<i>Now, smoke before fire.</i>

41:41.840 --> 41:45.120
<i>That means the white pieces</i>
<i>move before the black.</i>
