WEBVTT

00:20.587 --> 00:22.658
Do you think she's
prettier than me?

00:22.722 --> 00:24.065
I do.

00:24.991 --> 00:29.201
That may just be a family bias.
We owned this in the 17th century,

00:29.262 --> 00:32.470
then lost it, along with a lot of heads,
during the revolution.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.844
So, how are things going
with our detective?

00:36.903 --> 00:39.747
They're not.
He's not interested in me.

00:40.140 --> 00:43.144
Maybe you need to try a little harder.
He did save your life.

00:43.209 --> 00:46.679
Apparently, he doesn't feel
right taking advantage of that.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.283
You know how to make
yourself irresistible.

00:49.349 --> 00:52.387
I do. But it's going to
require a little effort.

00:53.453 --> 00:55.296
Well, the sooner the better.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.837
Lucky for you,
he had a physical recently.

01:02.829 --> 01:04.706
Why is this so important to you?

01:04.763 --> 01:06.334
It's important to you, too.

01:06.399 --> 01:10.074
A Grimm on the other side isn't
good for either one of us.

01:10.136 --> 01:12.582
So, why am I not going after him?

01:15.141 --> 01:17.485
Because the way to a man's soul

01:18.812 --> 01:20.485
is through his friends.

01:22.015 --> 01:23.551
Now, go fall in love.

01:26.886 --> 01:28.365
I think she's fat.

01:32.125 --> 01:34.435
Nick, I want to ask you something.

01:34.494 --> 01:36.906
That sounds important.
Well, it sort of is.

01:42.669 --> 01:44.342
I think it's time...

01:46.940 --> 01:52.049
Juliette, if you have
something to say, just say it.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.991
I know it's been a
little tough lately.

01:55.048 --> 01:57.824
No. No. I want to learn to shoot.

01:59.119 --> 02:02.259
What, a gun? No, a bow and arrow.
Yes, a gun.

02:04.157 --> 02:05.761
I thought you didn't
like guns. I don't.

02:05.825 --> 02:07.771
But you know what I like even less?

02:07.827 --> 02:10.467
Feeling unsafe in my own home.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.880
Are you expecting anyone? No. You?

02:19.839 --> 02:21.477
I thought I told you
never to come back here.

02:21.541 --> 02:24.112
No, please, don't take this wrong.
Don't jump to any conclusions.

02:24.177 --> 02:25.554
It's just that I feel so bad.

02:25.612 --> 02:27.614
We've all felt so bad about
what happened here at your house

02:27.680 --> 02:29.887
you share with your not wife.

02:29.949 --> 02:32.190
Who is lovely, by the way.

02:32.252 --> 02:35.597
Oh, and here she is.
Hello, ma'am. Hi.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.862
We made you both a
little something.

02:37.924 --> 02:41.838
If you ever decide to get married
and have a family. Or not.

02:42.195 --> 02:44.038
Uh, well, here it is.

02:45.131 --> 02:49.011
Oh, and by the way, we're making
sure no one else bothers you again.

02:49.068 --> 02:51.139
And one more thing. I notice that
your door needs a little work.

02:51.204 --> 02:52.444
Maybe you hadn't noticed.

02:52.505 --> 02:54.178
Oh, I've been a little busy.

02:54.274 --> 02:57.619
Right. Right, of course you have. Well,
anyway, uh, I didn't mean to interrupt.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.247
Uh, thanks again so
much for everything.

02:59.312 --> 03:02.122
Uh, enjoy. Uh,
go back to whatever. Uh, bye.

03:03.049 --> 03:04.050
Huh.

03:06.653 --> 03:09.793
The refrigerator repairman is going
to keep people from bothering us?

03:09.856 --> 03:12.132
I don't understand.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.366
Yeah. Uh, remember that
license plate you wrote down?

03:15.428 --> 03:17.032
Those people who were
watching us? Yeah.

03:17.096 --> 03:18.939
Well, I went to their
house and he was there.

03:18.998 --> 03:21.171
The refrigerator repairman? Yeah.

03:22.001 --> 03:23.480
And I told them to
stop bothering us.

03:23.536 --> 03:27.313
Did they say anything? Did they explain
why they were watching our house?

03:27.974 --> 03:30.716
Well, apparently, they'd had
some trouble with some guy,

03:30.777 --> 03:33.519
and they thought I was that guy,
and they just wanted to see if I was.

03:33.580 --> 03:36.060
Well, who is the guy
they thought you were?

03:36.115 --> 03:38.652
You know what? I didn't actually
get the details on that.

03:38.718 --> 03:42.063
But I guess they felt really
bad about their mistake.

03:42.121 --> 03:43.566
Why don't we open this up?

03:52.865 --> 03:54.606
Oh, it's really beautiful.

03:55.935 --> 03:56.936
Yeah, it is.

04:00.306 --> 04:01.910
They must have felt really bad.

04:15.054 --> 04:17.762
This is going to be
a big score for us.

04:18.024 --> 04:19.024
Yeah, big.

04:43.616 --> 04:44.754
I'm feeling good.

04:45.485 --> 04:48.591
I'm real good. Let's do this.

04:49.322 --> 04:51.461
Come on. Come on. Come on!

05:15.915 --> 05:17.917
Hi. Remember me?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.458
Of course.

05:21.521 --> 05:24.434
What can I do for you?
I made a list.

05:32.632 --> 05:35.738
Coeur diable, rot inguen,
essigblasse.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.244
Hmm. Let me get it for you.

05:42.375 --> 05:43.911
Freddy? Yes.

05:45.144 --> 05:47.146
Fresh. Yes, ma'am.

05:49.315 --> 05:50.316
Absolutely.

06:00.493 --> 06:01.494
Let's do this.

06:03.696 --> 06:04.936
Come on.

06:05.231 --> 06:08.144
How much do I owe you? Nothing.
It's on the house.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.306
That is so sweet.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.350
Thank you, Freddy.

06:12.939 --> 06:14.577
Anytime.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.192
Can I help you?

06:29.589 --> 06:30.966
Where's the J?

06:40.466 --> 06:42.070
Idiot. Where is it?

06:42.935 --> 06:45.779
And I want the pharmaceutical grade stuff,
not the crap you've got on the shelf.

06:45.872 --> 06:48.148
In the basement.

06:50.643 --> 06:51.644
Let's go.

07:12.999 --> 07:15.001
Where is it? Well,
it's got to be here somewhere.

07:19.939 --> 07:22.317
Got some. I got some!

07:22.642 --> 07:24.417
The mother lode. Come on.

07:27.246 --> 07:29.055
We've got to get out of here.
Forget about it.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.755
The cops are going to be here.
Let's go! There's boxes over here.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.925
Thanks for the J, man.

07:37.990 --> 07:39.128
Later.

07:45.398 --> 07:47.742
Come on! We've got to get
out of here! Let's go!

07:49.135 --> 07:50.375
Clint, come on!

07:52.171 --> 07:54.777
Let's go. Oh, my leg.

07:54.841 --> 07:56.980
Let's go. We've got to move.
He bit my legs.

08:00.913 --> 08:02.153
Well, he was shot at close range.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.661
There's some powder
burns on his clothing.

08:04.717 --> 08:07.823
He's got some blood in his mouth.
Internal bleeding, maybe.

08:12.124 --> 08:15.367
Looks kind of human.
He took a bite out of his killer?

08:16.229 --> 08:18.675
Looks like it.
Makes for some good DNA.

08:20.099 --> 08:22.670
Why kill the owner of
a tea and spice shop?

08:22.735 --> 08:24.544
How much money could there
be in a place like this?

08:24.604 --> 08:26.208
Maybe he was dealing
under the table.

08:26.272 --> 08:27.683
I've checked this
guy out once before.

08:29.809 --> 08:31.948
Fuchsbau, right? Oh, my God.

08:32.410 --> 08:33.616
There's a basement.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.159
Awful lot of herbs and spices.

08:42.221 --> 08:44.827
Yeah, who knows what
all this stuff is.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.962
We better get it all tested.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.908
We've got to check phone
records and find next of kin.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.403
I got a Rosalee Calvert.
Victim's sister.

08:56.469 --> 08:58.881
Uh, listed as beneficiary.
Lives in Seattle.

08:58.938 --> 09:02.112
You want me to make the call? No.
It's my turn.

09:16.989 --> 09:19.299
Hello? Is this Rosalee Calvert?

09:19.358 --> 09:20.359
Yes.

09:20.760 --> 09:24.799
This is Detective Burkhardt from
the Portland Police Department.

09:24.864 --> 09:27.708
Uh, you have a brother,
Frederick Calvert.

09:29.835 --> 09:30.836
Yes.

09:32.538 --> 09:34.814
Okay. Let's see.

09:34.874 --> 09:38.151
Time for blood of the deceived.

09:45.985 --> 09:50.263
And blood of the deceiver.

10:10.509 --> 10:14.013
Detectives Burkhardt, Griffin.
This is Rosalee Calvert.

10:15.748 --> 10:18.388
I'm sorry you had to come down
here under these circumstances.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.829
Please. Sit down.

10:20.886 --> 10:22.866
Who killed him? We don't know yet.

10:24.290 --> 10:25.564
What do you know?

10:25.625 --> 10:27.536
He was killed in an
apparent robbery.

10:27.893 --> 10:30.999
Since no money was taken, we assume
they were after something in the shop.

10:31.063 --> 10:32.599
He was able to set off
the emergency alarm,

10:32.665 --> 10:35.043
so we don't know if they
got what they were after.

10:37.737 --> 10:40.183
What do you know about
your brother's business?

10:40.640 --> 10:45.089
He sold tea, spices and herbs.
Not very complicated.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.681
My brother didn't have any
enemies that I know of.

10:48.047 --> 10:49.117
Is that your next question?

10:51.050 --> 10:53.792
Do you know if your brother was
dealing in anything illegal?

10:54.320 --> 10:58.564
No. I saw him once a year and I
spoke to him mostly on the phone.

10:58.624 --> 11:00.001
I want to bury him.

11:00.559 --> 11:02.004
Yeah, got it, thanks.

11:02.061 --> 11:03.972
I want to close up his
shop and I want to go home.

11:04.030 --> 11:06.101
So, what do I have to
do to get that done?

11:06.165 --> 11:07.371
Lab reports are in.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.276
I'd like to go to the shop.
Can I do that?

11:09.702 --> 11:11.841
Well, we are done with
our investigation.

11:11.904 --> 11:14.976
But one of us will have to go with
you until we know Forensics are done.

11:42.068 --> 11:43.843
We don't know if that's
all your brother's blood.

11:43.903 --> 11:45.814
He might have taken a
bite out of the killer.

11:50.810 --> 11:53.222
I didn't hurt your brother.
I'm not going to hurt you.

11:57.550 --> 12:01.020
Do you know anything
about gallenblase?

12:03.789 --> 12:05.564
Human gallbladder.
I know what it is.

12:07.593 --> 12:09.766
Did you know your
brother was dealing?

12:11.430 --> 12:12.431
No.

12:15.868 --> 12:17.370
He was being supplied by Geiers.

12:17.770 --> 12:20.717
Is that who killed him?
That was my first thought.

12:21.173 --> 12:23.153
But I think whoever killed
him was after something else.

12:23.676 --> 12:24.677
What?

12:26.045 --> 12:27.752
I was hoping you could tell me.

12:28.013 --> 12:30.323
I have no idea what he has in here.

12:33.285 --> 12:34.389
But I'll look.

12:40.226 --> 12:42.228
Yeah. Went over the lab reports.

12:42.962 --> 12:44.600
We've got a big fat nothing.

12:45.030 --> 12:48.102
Just like the sign says,
herbs, spices and teas.

12:48.167 --> 12:50.010
A few are poisonous,
but none are illegal.

12:50.703 --> 12:52.808
You get anything? Not yet.

12:54.106 --> 12:57.019
I think the sister is
clean I'm coming back.

13:05.184 --> 13:06.959
If you can think of anything

13:09.121 --> 13:13.069
or if you need anything,
just... Just call me.

13:14.727 --> 13:16.434
You're not at all what I expected.

13:18.030 --> 13:19.134
Yeah.

13:20.232 --> 13:22.974
You find out anything...
I'll call you.

13:39.618 --> 13:40.688
Doesn't it hurt?

13:40.753 --> 13:43.734
What do you think?

13:44.290 --> 13:45.530
Well, you shouldn't have shot him.

13:45.591 --> 13:47.628
He wasn't chomping on your leg.

13:47.927 --> 13:51.374
Aw, police are going to be
all over this thing now.

13:51.430 --> 13:53.933
We're going back. What?

13:53.999 --> 13:57.071
We left a fortune in there.
Cops don't know what we're after.

13:57.136 --> 13:58.615
And they'll be done going
over the place by now.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.151
Give me the needle. Give it to me!

14:23.262 --> 14:24.900
Hey. How are you doing?

14:24.964 --> 14:26.637
Hi. This is embarrassing.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.646
I just stopped by to
leave you some cookies.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.114
Yeah? I was doing some baking,

14:32.171 --> 14:36.586
and I thought I wouldn't be here if
it wasn't for you. So, here I am.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.912
You know, you already
bought me dinner.

14:38.978 --> 14:43.290
I know I didn't have to do this.
But you saved my life.

14:44.283 --> 14:47.560
And believe it or not,
that meant something to me.

14:47.920 --> 14:50.799
It's hard to know how to repay that.
This is more for me than it is for you.

14:50.856 --> 14:52.802
You might not even like
chocolate chip cookies.

14:54.093 --> 14:56.630
Well, in fact, I do.

14:56.695 --> 14:57.867
And that was very nice of you.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.603
Maybe I should have a bite.

15:03.669 --> 15:07.139
Maybe you should wait until I'm
gone in case you don't like them.

15:07.539 --> 15:08.984
I'm a brave soul.

15:12.611 --> 15:13.646
Mmm.

15:13.712 --> 15:15.020
Do we have a verdict?

15:17.249 --> 15:20.321
We do. They're incredible.

15:21.587 --> 15:24.067
Don't go giving those away.

15:24.123 --> 15:25.727
I made them just for you.

15:48.314 --> 15:50.260
Uh, nothing in the
spice shop was illegal.

15:50.516 --> 15:52.689
It's really a shame.
He was a nice guy.

15:55.321 --> 15:58.632
ls there anything in these reports
that someone would kill for?

15:58.724 --> 16:00.567
I'm sure there is.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.196
But I don't know what
any of these words mean.

16:02.828 --> 16:04.865
Beramethyl silacybanate?

16:05.798 --> 16:08.074
Hornisolic fullmanoxin?

16:08.133 --> 16:09.806
I mean, what the
heck is this stuff?

16:09.868 --> 16:12.212
I have no idea. Could you
tell by looking at it?

16:12.604 --> 16:13.605
Maybe.

16:24.917 --> 16:26.123
Another partner?

16:27.553 --> 16:31.126
Sort of. Um... This is Monroe.

16:31.190 --> 16:32.794
Monroe, this is Rosalee Calvert.

16:32.858 --> 16:34.895
I knew your brother. I'm sorry.

16:36.528 --> 16:38.599
We need to get into the basement.

16:38.664 --> 16:39.904
Do you need me to go with you?

16:40.165 --> 16:42.736
No, just a little follow-up. Okay.

16:53.212 --> 16:57.683
Okay, this box was open, and it looks
like some of the vials were taken.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.297
I can't be certain,
but it looks a little bit like J.

17:02.454 --> 17:05.560
"J"? It's derived from Jansene.
It's a kind of mold.

17:05.624 --> 17:06.932
It's lethal to most of humanity,

17:06.992 --> 17:09.973
but it has an opiate-like
effect on us.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.667
Used correctly,
it's an incredible painkiller.

17:12.731 --> 17:14.540
But if it's used for
recreational purposes,

17:14.599 --> 17:17.911
it's like meth mixed with
rat poison and helium.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.272
It's highly addictive.

17:19.637 --> 17:23.244
It's terrible for your liver, and it's
not so good for your brain, either.

17:23.308 --> 17:26.289
Of course, if you had a brain, you wouldn't
be using the stuff in the first place.

17:27.179 --> 17:28.351
Did you find something?

17:28.414 --> 17:30.291
Do you know of a drug called J?

17:31.083 --> 17:32.084
Yes.

17:32.317 --> 17:33.694
Do you know if your
brother was selling it?

17:35.521 --> 17:38.058
Even if he was, it's not illegal.

17:38.357 --> 17:42.863
She's right. That's why you, you know,
the cop you, has never heard of it.

17:42.928 --> 17:45.738
I need to know everything in this
basement that a Wesen would kill for.

17:46.198 --> 17:48.337
Will it help you find the
men who killed my brother?

17:48.634 --> 17:50.807
I hope so. Then I'll do it now.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.581
Okay. I'll call you later.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.651
You said you knew my brother?

18:01.447 --> 18:02.448
Yes.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.662
I just wanted to make sure.

18:18.197 --> 18:19.870
So, they don't know, do they?

18:21.767 --> 18:24.441
Who? The cops you work with.
They don't know who you are.

18:25.337 --> 18:26.338
No.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.648
Does it matter?

18:30.709 --> 18:35.249
I'm just trying to
understand how this works.

18:36.849 --> 18:40.922
It's, um... It's a
little complicated.

18:41.420 --> 18:42.990
Yeah, I can see that.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.030
Just find the men who
killed my brother.

19:20.692 --> 19:22.603
Oh, my gosh. You scared me.

19:23.128 --> 19:25.699
Sorry. What are you doing?

19:25.964 --> 19:30.037
Oh, the door. When I was here before,
I noticed that it needed work.

19:30.135 --> 19:31.273
And, well, Nick is so busy,

19:31.336 --> 19:33.748
and I thought maybe I'd come
over and help out a little bit.

19:33.805 --> 19:36.786
I'm really good at this stuff.
I can fix just about anything.

19:36.842 --> 19:39.721
Oh, before I forget...

19:39.778 --> 19:42.315
My wife baked you folks
a little something.

19:42.714 --> 19:44.489
Uh, I hope you like cherry.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.023
That's really nice,
but you do not have to keep doing...

19:47.085 --> 19:50.328
No, no, no, really. We want to.
My wife insisted.

19:50.389 --> 19:53.199
And she makes incredible pies.
Believe me.

19:53.325 --> 19:58.035
So, your door should be fine now.
So, uh, enjoy.

19:58.096 --> 19:59.131
What about your basket?

19:59.198 --> 20:01.940
Oh, uh... That's for you, too.
My kids made it.

20:20.852 --> 20:22.627
Come on. Let's go.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.099
The lights are on.

20:29.161 --> 20:31.664
Why are the lights on? Because
somebody forgot to turn them off.

20:31.730 --> 20:34.040
Let's just get the stuff and
get the hell out of here.

20:34.933 --> 20:36.913
These are open. Why are they open?

20:38.637 --> 20:41.584
Must be yours.

20:42.474 --> 20:44.283
No. Mine's in the car.

21:40.499 --> 21:42.536
She cut me. Shut up and help me.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.542
Don't you think it's
going a little overboard?

21:48.607 --> 21:50.553
Maybe they're just generous people.

21:50.609 --> 21:52.611
You know? Did he
really fix the door?

21:52.678 --> 21:55.056
Mmm-hmm. And he did a good job.

21:55.113 --> 21:56.114
Huh.

22:01.186 --> 22:02.563
Yeah, Burkhardt. It's Rosalee.

22:03.255 --> 22:05.257
I was at the shop and two men
broke in while I was there.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.201
Well, are you okay? Yes. I'm fine.

22:08.093 --> 22:09.265
I'm fine. I'm scared.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.934
I'm fine. I got away.
I'm at my brother's house.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.671
Are you safe there? I think so.

22:14.733 --> 22:17.236
Okay. Can you identify
the men who broke in?

22:17.302 --> 22:19.748
lf l saw them again, yes.

22:19.805 --> 22:22.376
All right, give me your address.
I'm sending officers to pick you up.

22:24.509 --> 22:26.614
Are you sure? Positive.

22:27.746 --> 22:28.986
How do you do this?

22:29.214 --> 22:30.784
Well, we start with
last known addresses,

22:30.849 --> 22:32.192
see if we can find them or
somebody who knows them.

22:32.250 --> 22:34.252
I mean you, as a cop.

22:35.187 --> 22:38.100
And the people you
work with have no idea?

22:40.092 --> 22:41.662
Well, I do what I can do.

22:43.462 --> 22:44.873
I don't envy you.

22:46.331 --> 22:48.140
It's not easy living two lives.

22:51.236 --> 22:52.544
I suppose you checked into mine.

22:52.604 --> 22:54.880
Next of kin are usually
the first suspects.

22:57.342 --> 23:00.221
You were arrested a couple of
times for breaking and entering?

23:00.278 --> 23:01.882
A long time ago.

23:01.947 --> 23:04.928
You want to talk about it? Not really.
I cleaned up my act.

23:06.451 --> 23:07.862
So, what am I supposed to do now?

23:09.454 --> 23:10.762
Be careful.

23:10.822 --> 23:12.096
I'm going to have some officers

23:12.157 --> 23:14.637
take you back to your brother's
house and stay outside.

23:16.695 --> 23:18.675
What about your partner?

23:19.965 --> 23:22.036
Hank? No, the other one.

23:22.701 --> 23:26.080
I want someone that I have
something in common with.

24:48.220 --> 24:50.723
Hi. Um... Nick called. He...

24:50.856 --> 24:53.837
He thought it would be a good idea if I
came over and, you know, kept an eye...

24:53.892 --> 24:55.701
Thanks for coming. Yeah.

25:03.869 --> 25:06.315
You can't be too careful.

25:07.873 --> 25:11.116
That's why I wanted a
Blutbad instead of a cop.

25:11.176 --> 25:13.452
The guys who came to the
shop were Skalengecks.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.822
Great. You'll be able to
smell them a mile away.

25:17.516 --> 25:20.122
There's food in the fridge.
You get the couch.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.797
Good night. Good night.

25:55.253 --> 25:56.732
Take it easy.

25:58.657 --> 26:02.230
Yeah. Sorry. I can see that now.
It's just me.

26:03.361 --> 26:06.274
I really appreciate what you did.
I'm going to go to the shop.

26:06.631 --> 26:08.838
Excuse me? You think
that's a good idea?

26:08.934 --> 26:11.471
I have no intention of staying
here any longer than I have to.

26:11.536 --> 26:12.708
I've got a lot to take care of.

26:12.771 --> 26:14.717
Okay. Can we just
slow down a second?

26:16.474 --> 26:18.078
Why would these guys
kill a shopkeeper

26:18.143 --> 26:20.214
for some herbs and spices
that aren't even illegal?

26:20.378 --> 26:21.823
That just doesn't make any sense.

26:21.880 --> 26:24.827
Well, there are plenty of legal
substances that will still fry your brain.

26:28.553 --> 26:31.363
Burkhardt. MONROE: Rosalee
says she's going to the shop.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.768
Where are you? I'm still
at her brother's place.

26:34.826 --> 26:36.737
What do you want me to do? Cookie.

26:36.795 --> 26:37.967
Were there any problems last night?

26:38.029 --> 26:39.099
Did you bring enough for everyone?

26:40.098 --> 26:41.133
No.

26:42.133 --> 26:43.771
My mother made the best
cookies on the block.

26:43.835 --> 26:46.008
She shared them with everyone
and they loved her for it.

26:48.039 --> 26:49.382
Well, do you think you
can talk her out of it?

26:49.441 --> 26:50.818
All right, I'll go cookieless.

26:50.875 --> 26:53.185
Just stay with her.
I'll send someone over there.

26:54.512 --> 26:56.423
See you. Hang on. Hang on.

26:57.382 --> 26:58.452
What have we got?

26:58.516 --> 27:02.157
Looks like we've got a vehicle ID
for Clint Vickers. One of our perps.

27:02.220 --> 27:05.463
We've got a patrol car on the street
watching the car. So far, no sightings.

27:05.523 --> 27:08.299
Okay, I need you to go back to the
spice shop, keep an eye on things.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.567
We'll check out the car.
Yeah. You got it.

27:29.814 --> 27:32.454
Okay. That's the car. And I'm
guessing they're in that building.

27:32.517 --> 27:34.428
Any contact? No movement.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.932
All right. You go around back.
We'll take the front.

29:03.908 --> 29:04.909
Hank.

29:19.390 --> 29:20.391
Hank.

29:37.542 --> 29:39.453
Hank. Hank.

29:40.111 --> 29:41.681
I saw someone.

29:43.148 --> 29:44.149
Who?

29:46.785 --> 29:47.889
I don't know.

30:05.336 --> 30:07.441
It's going to be sad to
see this place close.

30:07.505 --> 30:10.452
There's not that many
places we can go anymore.

30:10.508 --> 30:12.454
It's not an easy business.
You were in it?

30:12.510 --> 30:15.514
My parents were.
They were apothecaries.

30:16.314 --> 30:17.452
I gave it a shot.

30:19.517 --> 30:20.518
And what happened?

30:21.553 --> 30:23.692
Hey. I'm supposed to, uh...

30:25.857 --> 30:28.497
Uh, come down here and, uh,
make sure everything's...

30:28.560 --> 30:29.868
You don't look so good.

30:31.229 --> 30:32.867
Are you all right? Yeah.

30:33.364 --> 30:34.570
Yeah, never better.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.011
Oh, my God.

30:42.106 --> 30:43.551
Oh, God.

30:51.816 --> 30:53.853
Hmm. What the hell is this?

30:55.520 --> 30:58.694
My guess is they use it to smoke
whatever they want to smoke.

31:00.391 --> 31:02.667
They got away.
Want to tell me what happened?

31:03.595 --> 31:08.169
They made us when we got here,
Captain. We lost them.

31:08.233 --> 31:10.577
Captain, it was my fault. How?

31:10.802 --> 31:11.940
I thought I saw somebody.

31:12.270 --> 31:17.686
And I didn't want them to get hurt.
I got distracted and they got away.

31:25.116 --> 31:26.117
Yeah.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.963
This cop you sent down here
is in really bad shape.

31:29.020 --> 31:30.693
I mean, he just walked
in and collapsed,

31:30.788 --> 31:33.564
and his whole face looks like a
volcano that's about to explode.

31:34.659 --> 31:37.868
Rosalee says there's only one way to
deal with this, and it is definitely not,

31:38.429 --> 31:40.067
you know, standard
medical practice.

31:40.131 --> 31:43.169
So, you've got to get
down here, and fast.

31:46.871 --> 31:49.647
Uh, I sent Sergeant Wu to the spice shop,
and I think he has something.

31:49.707 --> 31:52.586
So, if you cover this,
I'll see what he has?

31:52.644 --> 31:53.679
Go.

31:55.146 --> 31:58.025
We all make mistakes, Hank.

31:58.883 --> 32:00.419
Luckily, no one got hurt.

32:00.885 --> 32:04.423
I can't find the keim extract.
Are you sure it's here?

32:04.489 --> 32:06.435
Top shelf, corner right.
I saw some yesterday.

32:06.491 --> 32:07.697
Got it.

32:11.429 --> 32:13.067
All of it? He'll need it.

32:17.168 --> 32:18.545
We need to get him to a hospital.

32:18.603 --> 32:21.311
They won't know what to do. They'll read
it as one of those mystery infections

32:21.372 --> 32:24.478
they can't identify and he'll die.
I've seen this before.

32:26.544 --> 32:29.388
Hold him down. Hold him down.
Hold him down.

32:29.447 --> 32:30.482
Hey.

32:30.548 --> 32:31.618
Hold him down.

32:31.683 --> 32:34.186
Here we go. Here we go.

32:35.353 --> 32:36.354
Okay.

32:40.825 --> 32:43.032
Hurry up. This is not going well.
Open his mouth.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.066
What, you want him to drink it?

32:45.129 --> 32:46.665
Yeah, he better.

32:47.432 --> 32:48.433
Come on. Get his mouth.

32:53.004 --> 32:54.005
Hey.

33:14.125 --> 33:15.126
Hello?

33:16.294 --> 33:17.534
Adalind. Yes?

33:17.695 --> 33:19.072
It's me, Hank.

33:19.163 --> 33:21.700
I've been calling and you haven't
been picking up. I got worried.

33:21.766 --> 33:23.074
About what?

33:23.601 --> 33:25.205
I just wanted to make
sure you were okay.

33:25.269 --> 33:28.148
That's very sweet, but I'm fine.

33:28.506 --> 33:29.883
Good.

33:29.941 --> 33:31.716
ls everything okay with you?

33:32.410 --> 33:33.411
Yeah.

33:34.245 --> 33:35.553
Just a lot going on.

33:37.248 --> 33:40.457
Listen. I was thinking maybe we
should get together for dinner.

33:40.518 --> 33:43.328
Oh. I'm really busy this week.

33:44.922 --> 33:45.923
Oh.

33:46.591 --> 33:50.596
But why don't you give me a call at the
end of the week and we'll see? Okay?

33:51.396 --> 33:53.342
Sure. Bye, Hank.

34:00.471 --> 34:01.973
How much longer?

34:02.040 --> 34:05.510
His pulse has calmed down.
We might as well have a look.

34:20.324 --> 34:21.803
I think it worked.

34:24.228 --> 34:25.400
He's going to sleep
for quite a while.

34:25.763 --> 34:27.174
Is there some place
we can take him?

34:27.231 --> 34:29.609
I think it would be best if he
woke up in familiar surroundings.

34:29.667 --> 34:31.668
Well, his apartment is not far.

34:31.803 --> 34:33.214
I'll get his feet.

34:44.248 --> 34:45.726
You said you've seen this before?

34:45.783 --> 34:47.820
Yeah. At my parents' shop.

34:48.219 --> 34:52.759
I was probably 17. A friend of my
father's came in with the same symptoms.

34:53.257 --> 34:56.795
My father said he had ingested a
zaubertrank meant for somebody else.

34:56.860 --> 34:58.363
Zaubertrank. They can be nasty.

34:58.429 --> 35:00.409
Does somebody want to tell
me what a zaubertrank is?

35:00.465 --> 35:02.502
Primitive, antediluvian,

35:02.567 --> 35:05.207
pseudo-psychological concoctions
meant to mess with your head.

35:05.269 --> 35:07.180
It causes obsessive behaviors.

35:07.238 --> 35:10.412
If the right person takes it.
It creates a deep emotional response.

35:10.475 --> 35:15.015
But if the wrong person takes it, this
happens. I think we caught it in time.

35:15.113 --> 35:18.424
Can we leave him alone? Yeah,
he should be good for a few hours.

35:19.650 --> 35:20.890
All right. We almost caught the men

35:20.952 --> 35:22.795
who killed your brother,
but they got away.

35:22.854 --> 35:25.698
In their apartment, we found the boxes
of J that they stole from the shop.

35:25.756 --> 35:28.293
And we also found this pipe.
It kind of looked like a horn.

35:29.594 --> 35:32.768
A saugendampf. Oh, man. Addicts.

35:32.830 --> 35:35.071
And you got their stash.
They will be needing more.

35:35.133 --> 35:38.580
And I am telling you,
addicts with guns is just a bad combo.

35:38.636 --> 35:39.876
Where would they go for more?

35:39.937 --> 35:41.143
Don't look at me. I'm...

35:41.639 --> 35:42.640
I'm not.

35:45.576 --> 35:47.385
I have a feeling you know.

35:50.748 --> 35:51.749
Yeah.

35:53.484 --> 35:54.690
I was hooked for seven years.

35:56.120 --> 35:59.567
My brother finally helped me to get clean.
That's why I went to Seattle.

36:01.592 --> 36:04.869
If they're looking to score,
it will be an Island of Dreams.

36:04.929 --> 36:08.536
A trauminsel? Here?
They're everywhere.

36:08.599 --> 36:10.476
Are we talking about some
kind of Wesen crack house?

36:10.902 --> 36:12.677
Yeah. Well, how do we find it?

36:12.737 --> 36:15.149
We find a dealer. They'll know.

36:25.049 --> 36:27.655
You're kidding me.
Rosalee? Mmm-hmm.

36:27.885 --> 36:29.922
You're looking good. Thanks.

36:29.987 --> 36:31.295
I thought you went straight, baby.

36:31.822 --> 36:33.096
What are you doing
around these parts again?

36:33.157 --> 36:34.761
Oh, you know why I'm here.

36:35.393 --> 36:38.272
It's a shame. How much
trauminsel time you want?

36:38.729 --> 36:40.265
Enough for two.

36:47.104 --> 36:48.378
Sweet dreams.

37:03.287 --> 37:05.233
It's my brother.
I should be the one that goes in.

37:05.289 --> 37:06.529
You've done enough.

37:09.961 --> 37:12.635
Let me handle this.
Okay? Just don't act like a cop.

37:12.697 --> 37:15.644
We're just a couple of Blutbaden out
on the town, having a good time.

37:17.668 --> 37:19.147
What up, bro?

37:56.374 --> 37:59.981
I can't smell anyone in here, man.
This is brutal.

38:01.312 --> 38:03.849
You take those. But be careful.

38:44.955 --> 38:46.662
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

39:09.814 --> 39:12.021
I got him, Nick! I got him!

39:47.551 --> 39:49.588
Are you sure you're okay? Yeah,
yeah. Yeah.

39:51.922 --> 39:55.426
Don't remember much.
I went to that shop like you wanted.

39:57.027 --> 39:58.165
Woke up here.

39:59.897 --> 40:01.774
Had some weird-ass dreams.

40:01.866 --> 40:06.406
Clearly, I'm going to need a facial.
And I'm just kind of hungry.

40:06.470 --> 40:07.744
You got something to eat here?

40:07.805 --> 40:10.877
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

40:11.876 --> 40:14.618
Listen. You take it easy for
the next couple of days.

40:14.678 --> 40:16.419
And if you need anything,
you call me.

40:16.480 --> 40:19.324
Yes. Will do. Thanks.

40:20.584 --> 40:21.585
All right.

41:05.396 --> 41:07.034
Oh. Hey. Hi.

41:10.768 --> 41:13.146
Now, I know it's not

41:13.204 --> 41:15.548
equal trade for my life,

41:15.606 --> 41:19.179
but I just wanted to say I'm glad you
know how to clock a dude with a brick.

41:20.344 --> 41:23.814
Nobody's given me
flowers for a long time.

41:28.285 --> 41:30.765
So, what's going on?
I thought you were packing up.

41:31.789 --> 41:34.929
Sort of changed my mind.

41:34.992 --> 41:38.201
I had to stick around for the trial,
so I thought I'd keep the shop open

41:38.262 --> 41:40.105
until I had to sell it.

41:40.164 --> 41:42.974
And I'd forgotten Portland
is a pretty nice place.

41:43.033 --> 41:45.639
Yeah. It kind of grows on you.

41:46.003 --> 41:47.414
Yeah.

41:48.272 --> 41:52.015
Well, I've got the rest of the day off if,
you know, you need any help.

41:52.843 --> 41:56.655
Sure. I'll put these in water.

42:11.729 --> 42:13.231
Are you sure you've
never done this before?

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
