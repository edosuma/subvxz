00:02.877 --> 00:06.430
Tell me I'm wrong, 'cause I'm
never wrong about oatmeal.

00:06.518 --> 00:07.782
(slurp!)

00:07.875 --> 00:10.508
You know, you really <i> can</i>
taste a difference

00:10.578 --> 00:11.696
with the steel-cut.

00:11.721 --> 00:12.633
Thank you.

00:12.658 --> 00:14.125
Thank you for trusting me

00:14.252 --> 00:16.039
to take you on this
breakfast journey.

00:16.064 --> 00:17.048
Shit!

00:17.073 --> 00:18.641
Uh, excuse you.

00:18.697 --> 00:21.164
They did it.
They finally did it.

00:21.221 --> 00:23.951
Finally made a Junior Jumble
you couldn't master, huh?

00:24.024 --> 00:25.063
Here, let me take a look.

00:25.128 --> 00:26.305
They freakin' did it!

00:26.399 --> 00:27.929
Did what?!

00:30.420 --> 00:35.071
The Langley Falls Art Museum
has acquired the paintings...

00:35.196 --> 00:36.985
of Reynolds...

00:37.094 --> 00:38.938
- Jasperterian.
- Who's that?

00:39.016 --> 00:41.219
It's philistine attitudes
like that

00:41.265 --> 00:44.016
that have kept this rinky-dink
burg off the cultural map!

00:44.064 --> 00:46.008
Roger, please, your tone!

00:46.086 --> 00:48.664
You know who's the best artist?
Gary Larson.

00:48.769 --> 00:52.391
He took us all to the far side
and kept us chuckling.

00:52.517 --> 00:53.649
(sighs)

00:53.708 --> 00:54.774
You know, Roger,

00:54.834 --> 00:56.758
I knew Reynolds Jasperterian.

00:56.789 --> 00:57.766
You did?

00:57.798 --> 00:59.798
Dit-dit-dit-dit-dit.

01:07.633 --> 01:09.607
Francine, do we have any honey?

01:09.679 --> 01:11.279
(footsteps recede)

01:14.091 --> 01:16.121
(squirt!)

01:19.445 --> 01:20.457
What?!

01:20.520 --> 01:22.993
You knew Reynolds Jasperterian?!

01:23.076 --> 01:26.345
Knew him?
He painted my portrait.

01:27.368 --> 01:28.227
Ahem!

01:28.274 --> 01:31.313
The Smiths are going
to the art museum!

01:31.426 --> 01:34.500
That includes me.
I took Hayley's last name.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.165
I'm the wife!

02:11.187 --> 02:14.560

02:22.083 --> 02:23.881
Roger, I'm surprised.

02:23.996 --> 02:26.146
I thought Reynolds Jasperterian
was gonna be you.

02:26.190 --> 02:28.349
I gotta tell you, I did, too.

02:28.537 --> 02:31.201
"I capture forever and share

(gasps) Oh, Reynolds.

02:36.735 --> 02:38.565
Big whoop. I'm in the CIA.

(camera shutters clicking)

02:42.045 --> 02:43.435
What's this line for?

02:43.506 --> 02:45.154
To see Jasperterian's
masterpiece.

02:45.209 --> 02:47.451
Does it have two funny animals
and a joke?

02:47.537 --> 02:48.748
A fat kid wearing glasses

02:48.825 --> 02:50.615
and a hilarious
observation underneath?

02:50.697 --> 02:52.357
If not, I'm like that T. Rex

02:52.446 --> 02:54.586
watching the asteroid
hurl towards earth.

02:54.673 --> 02:56.193
"Uh, check, please."

02:56.249 --> 02:57.287
No!

02:57.327 --> 03:00.357
It's his "Portrait of
Francine's Genitals."

03:00.470 --> 03:02.029
Wait, what?!

03:02.279 --> 03:03.482
Astounding.

03:03.512 --> 03:06.178
What an achievement.

03:06.446 --> 03:08.546
(horror-movie music plays)

03:08.571 --> 03:09.638
No!

03:09.679 --> 03:11.131
All of you, stop looking!

03:11.183 --> 03:12.599
Don't look at this!
This is private!

(screaming)

03:23.206 --> 03:25.511
Oh, yeah, I forgot
to tell you kids,

03:25.598 --> 03:28.121
the portrait is of my box.

03:28.855 --> 03:31.371
STEVE: I can't unsee
any of this, can I?

03:31.644 --> 03:33.152
Where did you get
that falafel pita?

03:33.228 --> 03:35.144
I had it in my pocket.

03:37.842 --> 03:40.214
(laughing)

03:40.301 --> 03:41.980
Ah. Stan Smith,

03:42.034 --> 03:44.761
the fellow whose wife's pudenda
we all saw

03:44.809 --> 03:46.504
on the wall of the art museum.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.222
I also got the tote bag.

03:48.321 --> 03:51.832
And I <i> stuffed</i> it with zucchinis.

03:52.973 --> 03:56.342
I thought last year's Matisse
exhibition was a thrill.

03:56.523 --> 03:58.949
But to witness a Jasperterian
in person.

03:59.102 --> 04:00.975
You shut your filthy mouth!

04:02.022 --> 04:03.397
(chuckling) Oh, yes.

04:03.486 --> 04:05.506
It's going to be
a very amusing day.

04:05.573 --> 04:06.967
(yells)

04:09.494 --> 04:10.778
Oh, what a day.

04:10.893 --> 04:12.418
This is some day, I'll tell ya.

04:12.487 --> 04:14.417
Steve, what are you doing
out there?

04:14.470 --> 04:16.137
Yeah, you're usually
in your room,

04:16.190 --> 04:18.457
moaning at some
mysterious activity.

04:18.589 --> 04:22.325
Well, I had my normal afternoon
all planned out.

04:22.436 --> 04:24.036
Shades were drawn,

04:24.104 --> 04:27.309
my favorite pages were
bookmarked and waiting for me.

04:27.465 --> 04:29.762
My Korean micro-fiber
polishing mitten

04:29.872 --> 04:31.602
rinsed out and almost dry.

04:31.848 --> 04:35.317
I untied the drawstring of
my loose-fitting Gypsy pants.

04:35.403 --> 04:37.154
Okay, set the scene <i> less.</i>

04:37.246 --> 04:39.403
But there was one problem.

04:39.590 --> 04:43.207
No matter what I looked at,
all I saw was...

04:43.317 --> 04:44.739
that painting.

04:44.853 --> 04:46.043
(screams)

04:46.090 --> 04:47.317
I think I'm broken!

04:47.356 --> 04:48.589
It's no big deal, Steve.

04:48.676 --> 04:50.620
Mom's always flashing me
that thing.

04:50.754 --> 04:52.403
"Does this look right to you?"

04:52.489 --> 04:53.715
Ew.

04:53.786 --> 04:56.215
Maybe you can use your newfound
time to help people.

04:56.317 --> 04:58.106
Like how I'm helping Jeff
with his coloring.

04:58.192 --> 04:59.911
I'm ready for red now.

05:01.778 --> 05:04.465
Are you sure you're done
with the green?

05:04.817 --> 05:07.262
Wait! One more thing.

05:07.660 --> 05:08.676
(humming)

05:08.730 --> 05:09.746
You!

05:09.800 --> 05:11.754
You embarrassed me in front
of everybody!

05:11.814 --> 05:14.090
- By making London broil?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:14.176 --> 05:16.223
Don't drag your delicious
London broil

05:16.269 --> 05:18.285
into a conversation
about that filthy painting!

05:18.355 --> 05:20.387
Are you still upset about that?

05:20.449 --> 05:22.207
That painting was years ago.

05:22.340 --> 05:25.855
Besides, it's an honor
to inspire great art.

05:25.918 --> 05:27.965
I don't intend to share
my property

05:28.027 --> 05:31.113
with the low-brow pond scum
that frequent art museums.

05:31.168 --> 05:34.496
I'm sorry, Stan, did you say
your <i> property?</i>

05:34.574 --> 05:37.551
Well, yeah.
That part of you is owned by me.

05:37.621 --> 05:40.012
That's what our wedding
was all about, right?

05:42.723 --> 05:45.465
I hope you can learn to enjoy
the portrait, Stan,

05:45.558 --> 05:48.902
because you don't deserve
to enjoy the real thing!

05:50.980 --> 05:51.985
Francine, wait!

05:52.053 --> 05:55.285
KLAUS: Oh, hi, Francine.
Excited for that London broil.

05:55.348 --> 05:56.738
Oh, okay, you're
storming upstairs.

05:56.792 --> 05:57.608
Francine!

05:57.647 --> 05:59.863
She stormed upstairs
in a huff, Stan!

05:59.928 --> 06:01.449
Oh, but maybe you'd like
to come in,

06:01.504 --> 06:04.246
chat with your friend Klaus,
maybe clean my bowl!

06:04.316 --> 06:05.785
Yeah, maybe.
Let me think it over.

06:05.832 --> 06:06.996
Okay.

06:07.113 --> 06:09.582
It's just that Roger's
minor-league baseball character

06:09.613 --> 06:13.723
Rusty Buntafolio spits tobacco
in my bowl when he's frustrated.

06:13.836 --> 06:14.918
(door slams)

06:15.004 --> 06:17.281
Oh, hey, Rusty.
How was the game?

06:17.348 --> 06:18.793
RUSTY: Horrible! (growls)

06:18.848 --> 06:20.637
They pulled me after one pitch.

06:20.723 --> 06:22.887
My arm feels like
a sock full of sand.

06:22.955 --> 06:25.558
They're sending me down
to Delmarva, I just know it.

06:25.676 --> 06:26.620
Rusty, please!

06:26.645 --> 06:27.613
(Rusty spits,
water splashes lightly)

06:27.691 --> 06:32.193
I don't understand!
You have an empty Slurpee cup!

06:35.683 --> 06:37.253
WOMAN: It's so brave, you know,

06:37.370 --> 06:39.532
to empower a woman's body
through art.

06:39.628 --> 06:43.471
Yeah. I-I love how...
how it's so feminist.

06:44.198 --> 06:45.417
We're just friends, Duncan.

06:45.464 --> 06:47.308
Right, right, definitely.

06:48.058 --> 06:49.069
Hey.

06:49.152 --> 06:50.995
Is this truly a great painting?

06:51.089 --> 06:52.839
Um, yeah. Definitely.

06:52.948 --> 06:56.628
I-I mean, the way the artist
takes her most private space

06:56.698 --> 06:59.441
and exposes it
for all of us to consume.

06:59.488 --> 07:00.652
You sick little man!

07:00.677 --> 07:01.855
Oh!

07:01.992 --> 07:03.214
Not in front of my girlfriend!

07:03.239 --> 07:04.230
Your what?

07:04.292 --> 07:05.392
My nothing.

07:07.316 --> 07:09.519
Art fan, huh? Me too.

07:09.609 --> 07:12.152
I love art.
Stealing it, that is.

07:12.279 --> 07:15.347
Tato Montacello...
art heist guy.

07:15.581 --> 07:17.550
Of course! Steal the painting!

07:17.575 --> 07:18.480
Exactly.

07:18.526 --> 07:21.269
And I'm gonna help ya,
because, are you ready?

07:21.331 --> 07:22.277
This is a good one.

07:22.336 --> 07:25.456
I cannot believe this hasn't
been in a movie already.

07:25.479 --> 07:30.806
Stealing art is
the greatest art of all.

07:31.316 --> 07:32.464
Oh, screw you, Stan!

07:32.489 --> 07:34.977
If Gary Larson drew a cow
with curlers in its hair

07:34.997 --> 07:36.762
saying that, you'd be dying!

07:37.183 --> 07:39.284
(chuckles) "Check, please."

07:39.349 --> 07:42.167
(laughing)

07:43.829 --> 07:45.922
(engine revving)

07:46.000 --> 07:47.878
So, you want to steal
a painting.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.416
Well, you're gonna need a crew.

07:49.472 --> 07:51.181
And the crew is here in Monaco?

07:51.206 --> 07:52.652
Oh, we're just in Monaco
because Monaco

07:52.733 --> 07:54.386
is where you have
this conversation.

07:54.495 --> 07:56.167
Most of the crew
is Jersey-based.

07:56.261 --> 07:58.427
Now, you need a crew
you can trust.

07:58.544 --> 08:00.886
But trust among art thieves?

08:00.956 --> 08:03.761
Let's just say it's rarer
than a Picasso.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.105
Are Picassos rare?

08:05.230 --> 08:07.487
Wait, we could have had this
conversation in the kitchen?

08:07.635 --> 08:10.573
Oh, please! You wanted this
trip, you needed this trip.

08:10.636 --> 08:13.433
What, with the stress you have
going on with the painting.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.887
Stan, trust me,
you needed to relax.

08:15.980 --> 08:18.175
And the walking tour?
You didn't enjoy that?

08:18.213 --> 08:20.198
I <i> was</i> impressed
by the walking tour.

08:20.223 --> 08:21.230
Exactly!

08:21.270 --> 08:24.112
That's the Monaco most tourists
don't get to see.

08:24.277 --> 08:25.948
Anyway, we should really
be getting back.

08:26.011 --> 08:27.842
Our flight's in, like,
an hour and a half.

08:27.854 --> 08:29.331
Damn it, we're gonna be late!
Hold on!

08:29.394 --> 08:31.159
(tires squeal)

08:35.412 --> 08:36.780
(sniffling)

08:36.878 --> 08:37.903
Are you crying?

08:37.972 --> 08:40.248
What?! Of course not!

08:40.370 --> 08:42.957
Because Stan and Roger
have time to fly to Monaco

08:43.038 --> 08:45.549
but no time to change
my bowl water?

08:46.191 --> 08:48.144
(voice breaking) You think
I'm crying because of that?

08:48.261 --> 08:49.652
Helping Klaus.

08:49.736 --> 08:51.620
<i>That</i> could count
as helping people.

08:51.683 --> 08:52.959
Oh, it definitely counts.

08:53.011 --> 08:54.527
Don't doubt yourself
for a second.

08:54.605 --> 08:56.183
Helping others
is my new hobby...

08:56.269 --> 08:58.386
ever since I saw the painting
of Mom's junk.

08:58.460 --> 09:01.097
Sure, sure.
Whatever road brought you here.

09:01.394 --> 09:03.073
Ugh! This is filthy!

09:03.159 --> 09:04.722
Shouldn't you have a bowl
with a filter?

09:04.816 --> 09:06.245
All that aquarium stuff?

09:06.362 --> 09:08.628
Yes. Yes, I should.

09:08.745 --> 09:11.448
But that might be expensive.

09:11.550 --> 09:15.534
Let's agree to go to the store,
but maybe not buy anything.

09:15.652 --> 09:19.222
Yes! A small win for Klaus!

09:19.378 --> 09:21.050
He was a phenomenal talent,

09:21.152 --> 09:23.730
but to me,
he was just... Reynolds.

09:23.808 --> 09:28.128
Mmm, yes. And you'd say
you <i> opened up</i> to him.

09:28.222 --> 09:30.127
(laughter)

09:30.222 --> 09:32.816
I admit this is
the Art History minor talking,

09:32.862 --> 09:34.835
but I would really like
to hear about

09:34.860 --> 09:37.050
Jasperterian's ideas on...

09:37.144 --> 09:38.683
You shut your filthy mouth,
Dick!

09:38.761 --> 09:40.909
- Stan!
- Relax, Smith.

09:40.972 --> 09:43.808
Just art lovers discussing
the glorious painting

09:43.855 --> 09:45.480
of your wife's thingamaboo.

09:45.589 --> 09:47.433
Although I must apologize
for Dick.

09:47.487 --> 09:48.946
He was out of line.

09:49.034 --> 09:51.902
Well, we're off to the
Mapplethorpe exhibit at the Met.

09:52.027 --> 09:54.732
With any luck,
that will get us hard.

09:55.034 --> 09:57.589
Francine, can't you see
you're embarrassing me?

09:57.683 --> 10:00.402
Genitals aren't something that
should be shown to the world!

10:00.471 --> 10:02.220
They're not called show-nitals.

10:02.307 --> 10:05.542
The term "genitals" comes from
the Aladdin word genie,

10:05.643 --> 10:06.596
and like a genie,

10:06.651 --> 10:08.393
they should only come out
when they're rubbed.

10:08.518 --> 10:11.096
Stan, you're embarrassing
yourself.

10:11.237 --> 10:14.862
(clears throat)
Tato Montacello, art heist...

10:14.940 --> 10:16.503
Wait, did I already do
my introduction?

10:16.604 --> 10:17.940
Yeah, we went to Monaco.

10:18.042 --> 10:20.198
Really? Long way to go
to meet somebody.

10:20.331 --> 10:23.807
Anyway, tonight, we make
that painting disappear!

10:24.674 --> 10:26.812
To pull off this heist,
we need muscle.

10:26.885 --> 10:30.245
The Ignatiev Twins weigh
700 pounds combined

10:30.315 --> 10:32.831
and grew up eating
raw horse meat in Dagestan.

10:32.895 --> 10:34.895
They still love horse meat...
it's disgusting.

10:34.897 --> 10:36.627
Their breath smells
like horse meat.

10:36.632 --> 10:37.980
Whatever, it's one night,
you'll survive.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.754
Next, we need a lockpick.

10:40.142 --> 10:41.819
Claude Verdeer is the Belgian

10:41.851 --> 10:43.710
with the smallest fingers
in the world.

10:43.780 --> 10:45.890
It's gross, and he always wants
to shake hands.

10:45.983 --> 10:48.280
But I know he can tell that
I don't want to shake hands.

10:48.343 --> 10:50.233
Whatever, it's one night,
you'll survive.

10:50.343 --> 10:52.452
Then we'll need
an explosives guy.

10:52.562 --> 10:55.835
We can either get
Bang Bang Fukanawa or Josh.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.171
Fine, get Bang Bang Fukanawa.

10:58.272 --> 11:00.093
Wait, why do we need
an explosives guy?

11:00.179 --> 11:01.530
Won't the Belgian guy get us in?

11:01.585 --> 11:03.030
Hmm. Good point.

11:03.108 --> 11:05.140
I thought we agreed
no explosives guy.

11:05.233 --> 11:06.257
Right.

11:06.312 --> 11:07.460
Josh, wait!

11:07.496 --> 11:08.976
(explosion)

11:09.054 --> 11:11.101
Josh, the guy we didn't need,

11:11.147 --> 11:12.944
was supposed to be
Bang Bang Fukanawa.

11:13.015 --> 11:14.601
Oh, so I was second choice?!

11:14.655 --> 11:16.522
Look, you're here and he's not.

11:16.624 --> 11:19.902
Chicharito, the Guatemalan
contortionist.

11:25.447 --> 11:30.132
Finally, we need a sexually
explosive, unpredictable woman.

11:30.219 --> 11:31.753
(cellphone chimes)

11:31.843 --> 11:33.584
(Russian accent)
Tato, is PayPal.

11:33.589 --> 11:34.788
Payment no go through.

11:34.859 --> 11:35.820
Hmm.

11:35.890 --> 11:38.578
Well, do you accept...
karate chops?!

11:38.602 --> 11:40.054
(smack!)

11:40.140 --> 11:41.628
(whispering)
Stan, finish him off.

11:44.689 --> 11:47.353
That's the last time
you screw me, Tato.

11:47.402 --> 11:49.798
(alarm blares)

11:49.923 --> 11:52.165
Mmm!

11:52.322 --> 11:53.533
Maybe one more time.

11:53.650 --> 11:55.291
(screams)

11:55.486 --> 11:57.205
MAN: Hey!

11:57.447 --> 11:58.994
(panting)

11:59.291 --> 12:01.361
Okay, let's give each other
notes on the heist.

12:01.463 --> 12:02.806
Stan, good job, but I thought

12:02.831 --> 12:04.252
you could have worn
a better outfit.

12:04.345 --> 12:06.303
What else?
I'd work with Josh again.

12:06.365 --> 12:09.279
Look, thanks for the help,
Roger, but this is a solo job.

12:09.373 --> 12:10.678
A solo job?

12:10.764 --> 12:13.596
Sounds like Steve before he got
into helping people.

12:13.779 --> 12:15.365
I wonder if he's still
doing that.

12:15.467 --> 12:16.567
Aah!

12:19.092 --> 12:21.279
We're talking top to bottom
tank renovation here.

12:21.334 --> 12:23.256
Steve, what's gotten into you?

12:23.303 --> 12:25.740
Your skin is clearer,
your voice sounds deeper.

12:25.779 --> 12:26.919
Oh, it started happening

12:26.967 --> 12:28.989
once I stopped touching myself
all the time.

12:29.099 --> 12:31.880
Funny, I find
the more I touch myself,

12:31.989 --> 12:33.947
the deeper my voice gets.

12:34.020 --> 12:36.187
Now, let's talk about
premium aquarium filters.

12:36.287 --> 12:38.998
Sounds like what you want
is a Tunze AquaWind.

12:39.092 --> 12:39.943
You sure?

12:39.968 --> 12:42.045
'Cause I been hearing good
things about the new DeSanio's.

12:42.138 --> 12:43.638
(laughs) Sure,

12:43.677 --> 12:45.802
if you want to replace it
every four weeks.

12:45.927 --> 12:47.994
Sounds like I better do
a little more research.

12:48.123 --> 12:50.677
You know, it's really weird that
you own an aquarium store.

12:50.787 --> 12:53.863
The regulars here think
it's weird I'm a principal.

12:56.808 --> 12:59.582
Excuse me.
I'd like to see somebody

12:59.660 --> 13:01.779
about getting a painting
taken down.

13:02.089 --> 13:04.871
I'm sick of arguing about it
with my husband.

13:04.949 --> 13:07.199
It makes him... uncomfortable.

13:07.253 --> 13:08.512
An uncomfortable husband?

13:08.597 --> 13:10.847
The director will want to hear
about this straightaway!

13:16.410 --> 13:19.238
Excuse me, are you... crying?

13:19.332 --> 13:21.253
Uh, yes, I suppose I was.

13:21.363 --> 13:25.300
It's just this reminds me
of my genitals

13:25.355 --> 13:28.334
when they were young and flush.

13:29.167 --> 13:31.143
Are you copying this painting?

13:31.198 --> 13:33.721
Trying.
It's an assignment for class.

13:33.807 --> 13:35.159
"Copy the Masters."

13:35.245 --> 13:37.759
But, gosh, I'm no Jasperterian.

13:37.876 --> 13:39.986
How did he know
what to leave out?!

13:45.525 --> 13:47.767
It's boota-ful!

13:47.823 --> 13:50.290
(panting) There you are.

13:50.454 --> 13:52.564
Our director will see you
in just a moment.

13:52.696 --> 13:55.439
(gasps)
The woman changed her mind.

13:55.564 --> 13:58.130
Sylvia, we have an intercom.

14:01.369 --> 14:05.557
That portrait certainly does
inspire intense fascination.

14:05.674 --> 14:08.127
Last night, we had
a thwarted robbery attempt.

14:08.199 --> 14:09.443
Oh, no!

14:09.541 --> 14:10.904
I'm afraid so.

14:11.010 --> 14:13.205
Hence the need for another
security guard.

14:13.307 --> 14:14.956
We're lucky you walked in.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.776
And with your CIA experience.

14:17.917 --> 14:21.190
Now, you do resemble a maniac
our guards...

14:21.223 --> 14:22.682
Right, but as I explained,

14:22.807 --> 14:24.550
that man did not have
a mustache.

14:24.628 --> 14:26.542
He did, however,
have a flag pin.

14:26.581 --> 14:27.377
But...

14:27.432 --> 14:28.378
But...

14:28.456 --> 14:30.581
he did not have a mustache.

14:30.721 --> 14:32.698
And I can see that you do.

14:32.792 --> 14:34.073
You're hired, Stan.

14:34.136 --> 14:37.307
Or should I say,
Mr. Night Watchman?

14:37.370 --> 14:40.010
(both laughing)

14:42.000 --> 14:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:49.367 --> 14:51.909
Yeesh.
Kind of creepy in here at night.

14:55.338 --> 14:56.830
You like looking at my wife?

14:56.893 --> 14:58.025
Huh, you little perv?!

14:59.461 --> 15:01.061
Well, it's over!

15:01.063 --> 15:02.983
I'm gonna take this painting
home and destroy it!

15:05.859 --> 15:07.759
Ah, that was easy.

15:11.851 --> 15:13.733
Did you hear what that oaf said?

15:13.843 --> 15:15.851
I'm not interested
in his wife's vagina.

15:15.905 --> 15:18.145
I'm completely homosexual.

15:18.444 --> 15:20.916
All art is gay.

15:23.452 --> 15:25.523
(high-pitched laughing)

15:26.739 --> 15:28.329
(squeaking)

15:29.798 --> 15:32.724
Where the (bleep) are my arms?!

15:33.251 --> 15:35.376
A shocking crime
at the Langley Museum.

15:35.462 --> 15:37.978
The famous "Portrait of
Francine's Genitals"...

15:38.071 --> 15:40.454
Hi, Francine!...
has been stolen.

15:40.601 --> 15:43.012
(crying) He made me feel
so beautiful.

15:43.060 --> 15:45.279
Francine, we already lost
the painting.

15:45.373 --> 15:47.263
Don't go losing your cool.

15:53.819 --> 15:55.849
(whistling)

16:01.892 --> 16:03.857
Stan, have you seen
my lucky jock strap?

16:03.919 --> 16:06.607
(sighs) The rumors are true,
I'm Delmarva-bound.

16:06.662 --> 16:09.208
Hey, the painting we stole!
Are you torching it?

16:09.294 --> 16:11.607
This painting has brought me
nothing but embarrassment.

16:11.701 --> 16:13.427
I don't want anyone
to ever see it again.

16:13.521 --> 16:14.990
Not even one person,

16:15.083 --> 16:17.937
like a rich, shady buyer
with 100K to burn?

16:18.068 --> 16:20.100
He's not gonna want anyone
to know he has it.

16:20.208 --> 16:21.574
No one else would ever see it.

16:21.740 --> 16:23.005
Hmm.

16:23.427 --> 16:24.677
I'm calling my coke dealer.

16:24.763 --> 16:26.169
Wow, he can afford the painting?

16:26.214 --> 16:28.584
Oh, yeah, maybe he could buy
the painting!

16:31.623 --> 16:34.794
Hi, I have some, uh,
pretty serious concerns

16:34.880 --> 16:37.013
about the flow through
on the 6500.

16:37.081 --> 16:38.725
WOMAN: Sounds like
you know your stuff.

16:38.803 --> 16:41.220
Here at Tunze, we pride
ourselves on flow through

16:41.245 --> 16:43.280
and will beat any competitor
on suction.

16:43.335 --> 16:44.827
Ha ha. Wha-what was that?

16:44.928 --> 16:46.249
Why don't I walk you through it?

16:46.350 --> 16:47.202
What's your name?

16:47.227 --> 16:49.059
- I-I'm Steve.
- I'm Lindsey.

16:49.146 --> 16:51.476
Well, actually,
we're up to the 6900 now.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.543
That baby satisfies everyone.

16:53.664 --> 16:55.372
It gobbles up dirt and filth,

16:55.401 --> 16:56.447
and when you can see
the chambers

16:56.485 --> 16:57.568
about to be at overflow,

16:57.602 --> 17:00.769
you just shoot it all
out the release shaft.

17:00.771 --> 17:02.501
Oh. Oh, okay.

17:02.507 --> 17:05.137
W-W-Would you mind
actually walking me

17:05.231 --> 17:07.512
through a couple other models?

17:10.501 --> 17:12.666
Yeah, yeah, this is what I
should have in <i> my</i> loft, man.

17:12.817 --> 17:14.337
This is what I should have...

17:14.384 --> 17:16.598
a big painting of
a woman's just, thing

17:16.712 --> 17:18.056
just hanging right there, right?

17:18.122 --> 17:19.829
Yep, exactly.
Listen, could we hurry this up?

17:19.857 --> 17:21.273
I-I really can't have my wife...

17:21.325 --> 17:24.317
Stan, have you seen Rusty's
lucky jock strap?

17:24.442 --> 17:25.825
What is that?

17:25.872 --> 17:27.895
- Um...
<i>- You</i> stole the painting?

17:27.958 --> 17:29.981
(chuckling) Oh, man!

17:30.130 --> 17:31.724
What a busted scene.

17:31.798 --> 17:33.332
Get out of here, Delmonico!

17:33.373 --> 17:34.559
You know Delmonico?

17:34.605 --> 17:37.293
Everybody knows Delmonico!

17:37.364 --> 17:38.637
Francine, I can explain.

17:38.707 --> 17:41.254
At least when you wanted
to get rid of it,

17:41.364 --> 17:43.206
it was about privacy!

17:43.372 --> 17:46.883
But now, trying to sell it
to our coke dealer?!

17:46.957 --> 17:50.246
I see you don't have
any principles at all!

17:50.328 --> 17:52.398
Oh, ho, wow.

17:54.567 --> 17:57.934
Well, I'm gonna go see if I can
sell Francine some drugs.

17:58.106 --> 18:01.804
What am I doing here?
I need a hard look at myself.

18:01.893 --> 18:02.918
You sure do.

18:03.028 --> 18:05.317
Hey, would it be funny
if I was an airplane?

18:05.489 --> 18:08.918
(imitates airplane)

18:11.542 --> 18:12.685
(buzzer)

18:12.778 --> 18:13.539
WOMAN: <i> Hello?</i>

18:13.564 --> 18:15.848
Hi, um, Mrs. Jasperterian?

18:15.906 --> 18:17.408
You don't know me, but I think

18:17.451 --> 18:20.727
you're the only person
who could help me right now.

18:23.607 --> 18:25.836
This place really stirs
something in me.

18:25.910 --> 18:28.750
My husband was inspired
by the vistas,

18:28.860 --> 18:31.406
which is all the more remarkable

18:31.539 --> 18:33.305
when you remember
Reynolds was blind.

18:33.430 --> 18:34.922
He... He was?

18:35.031 --> 18:37.727
Blind as a bat.
From the day he was born.

18:37.836 --> 18:40.770
So, he never <i> saw</i>
what he was painting.

18:40.860 --> 18:41.938
Nope.

18:41.998 --> 18:43.422
Somehow that
makes me feel better.

18:43.454 --> 18:45.742
- He painted by touch.
- Excuse me?

18:45.821 --> 18:48.149
Yes, he was very tactile.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.602
He really wanted
to get his hands

18:50.696 --> 18:53.081
all over anything
he was painting,

18:53.242 --> 18:54.766
get the feel of it.

18:54.899 --> 18:58.097
Rub it, pull it
between his fingers.

18:58.238 --> 19:01.371
(coughing)

19:01.396 --> 19:02.308
You okay, Stan?

19:02.359 --> 19:04.566
No, I'm not!
You're talking about my wife!

19:04.660 --> 19:06.113
No, I'm talking about

19:06.144 --> 19:08.894
what Reynolds did
to your wife's vagina.

19:09.089 --> 19:11.866
He took it
and he turned it into art.

19:12.022 --> 19:15.038
Once it's art,
it's not your wife anymore.

19:15.147 --> 19:17.467
Huh. I never thought about it
like that.

19:17.575 --> 19:19.436
Look, let me ask you this, Stan.

19:19.550 --> 19:23.960
Once the plaster cast dried,
was that mug still my butthole?

19:24.335 --> 19:26.842
♪♪

19:27.397 --> 19:29.061
Steve, how's the filter coming?

19:29.108 --> 19:30.272
The fresh water's nice,

19:30.303 --> 19:32.068
but it's already getting
dirty again.

19:32.178 --> 19:34.233
What?
Oh, I'm not doing that now.

19:34.325 --> 19:35.892
No, your voice!

19:36.108 --> 19:37.311
But that means...

19:37.358 --> 19:40.530
Let's just say
I hope Lindsey's call

19:40.631 --> 19:43.030
was monitored and recorded,
'cause it was sexy as hell!

19:43.102 --> 19:44.477
Oh, Steve.

19:44.616 --> 19:47.358
You sound just like Lindsey.

19:47.475 --> 19:48.641
(door slams)

19:51.123 --> 19:53.512
STAN: Of course, you all know
the story of this painting...

19:53.584 --> 19:55.912
stolen, missing,
but then returned.

19:56.014 --> 19:57.412
Bad luck for you, Stan.

19:57.483 --> 19:58.951
Now we get to see your wife's

19:58.990 --> 20:01.233
Trapper Keeper whenever we wish.

20:01.342 --> 20:03.478
Hmm.

20:04.225 --> 20:07.117
Art can have a powerful effect
on people.

20:07.280 --> 20:09.594
I like to think the thief,
whoever he was,

20:09.725 --> 20:11.863
took a good, long look
at this painting

20:11.964 --> 20:15.494
and he realized Jasperterian
truly did capture

20:15.532 --> 20:19.002
and share the most extraordinary
beauty in the world.

20:19.384 --> 20:23.072
Angela, let's take one
last trip to Paris.

20:23.107 --> 20:25.178
It's boota-ful!

20:25.296 --> 20:29.476
Maybe, Duncan, we <i> can</i> be...
more than friends.

20:29.647 --> 20:31.123
(retches)

20:31.319 --> 20:32.428
Sorry, Candace.

20:32.506 --> 20:36.256
Don't apologize.
I'm a barf babe.

20:36.436 --> 20:39.374
Jasperterian transformed
something intimate

20:39.530 --> 20:41.530
into something we can all share.

20:46.788 --> 20:48.835
But only I get the real thing.

20:48.975 --> 20:50.399
Mmm! Mmm!

20:50.436 --> 20:53.335
MAN: There's the maniac who
tried to steal the painting!

20:53.499 --> 20:55.023
Where?!

20:55.195 --> 20:57.266
Bye, have a beautiful time!
