00:01.435 --> 00:02.701
(blankets rustle,
bed creaks)

00:03.837 --> 00:05.304
- (exhales)
nathan: Fuck!

00:05.439 --> 00:07.439
- Huh? Oh, uh, fuck!

00:09.577 --> 00:11.243
- What are you doing?
- What? Nothing.

00:11.245 --> 00:13.511
Like, um, I'm like,
about to cum.

00:14.581 --> 00:16.147
- (nathan grunts)

00:17.184 --> 00:18.983
(grunts)

00:20.588 --> 00:22.187
(groans)

00:22.256 --> 00:24.155
Are you looking at your email?
- No!

00:25.726 --> 00:27.692
No, I was just-no, I was just
checking the time, real quick.

00:27.762 --> 00:29.360
- I'd prefer a present partner.

00:29.397 --> 00:31.196
- I'm sorry, can we start over?
- Please.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.132
- Here, go to your favourite,
come on.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.966
- All right, yeah.
- All right.

00:35.036 --> 00:37.669
- Let's hit the classics.
Hup! Hup! Here we go.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.605
- (moans)
- oh my!

00:39.740 --> 00:41.673
- Mm!
- Ah!

00:41.675 --> 00:43.675
- Oh fuck yeah.
- Mmm! Mmm.

00:43.711 --> 00:46.544
- Oh, you're a monster, yeah!
- (moans)

00:46.580 --> 00:48.547
- Oh!
(bed creaks)

00:48.549 --> 00:50.015
- Oh!

00:50.084 --> 00:51.683
(bed creaks)

00:51.752 --> 00:53.552
(both moan)

00:53.554 --> 00:55.487
- Oh god!

00:56.690 --> 00:58.523
Thank you so much for taking
the kids to school.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.425
I mean, assuming
they're well enough.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.160
- Look at them,
they're... They're fine.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.229
- Yeah, it's just with nathan
being away

01:04.231 --> 01:06.030
At all these hearings,
I'm like--

01:06.067 --> 01:07.499
- Please, your journalist
person's being interviewed

01:07.568 --> 01:09.468
By marion davenport, you don't
need to explain it to me.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.202
- I know, it's a big deal,
right?

01:11.238 --> 01:13.238
- It's a fuckin' huge deal!
She interviews like,

01:13.240 --> 01:14.873
Princes and shit!

01:14.909 --> 01:17.242
- I know, I can't fuck this up.
- You're not gonna fuck it up.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.111
- Oh god, but I double-dipped,

01:19.113 --> 01:20.912
I nearly cost this author
her own book.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.915
I-I got egged, anne,
I mean, that's rock bottom.

01:22.917 --> 01:24.650
Professionally speaking.

01:24.785 --> 01:27.352
- Waah, waah, waah.
So then, quit.

01:27.354 --> 01:28.954
Stop.

01:28.956 --> 01:30.722
- You-you think I should stop?

01:30.858 --> 01:32.224
- No, of course don't stop!
- No?

01:32.359 --> 01:34.393
- You're not gonna quit anyway,
so snap out of it!

01:34.395 --> 01:36.528
- (sighs) you're right,
thank you.

01:36.663 --> 01:38.831
- No problem. Anything to get
out of the house.

01:38.966 --> 01:40.865
- Oh my god, is lionel
still freezing you out?

01:40.901 --> 01:43.035
- There is a palpable chill.
- What is going on with him?

01:43.170 --> 01:45.203
- I don't know! He's just--
nathan jr.: Hey!

01:45.338 --> 01:47.706
Y-you're coming to my school
later, right?

01:47.841 --> 01:49.208
- For...

01:49.343 --> 01:51.677
- It's our assembly for my
public speaking unit, remember?

01:51.812 --> 01:54.046
- Yes, of course I remember.
Um...

01:54.181 --> 01:56.348
I'm-I'm just so slammed
at work today, though,

01:56.350 --> 01:58.316
I might see if your father
can make it.

01:58.352 --> 02:01.753
- It kinda has to be you.
- (inhales deeply)

02:01.789 --> 02:03.421
Uh, well, if it has to be me,

02:03.457 --> 02:05.257
Um, I can't wait!

02:05.259 --> 02:07.226
- Thank you.
- Hmm.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.060
Bye.

02:09.130 --> 02:10.696
(thermometer beeps)
oh, would you...

02:10.698 --> 02:13.731
- Yep. Can I have this?
Thank you.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.434
- Oh god, what's it say?

02:15.569 --> 02:17.502
- It's a hundred degrees,
it's barely a temperature.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.171
- You think?
- Yes!

02:19.173 --> 02:20.838
Just give 'em some cold meds,
call it a day.

02:20.875 --> 02:22.407
They'll be fine, I'm a doctor.
- Right, right.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.576
(charlie coughs)

02:24.612 --> 02:26.678
- Oh god, am I a bad parent?

02:26.680 --> 02:28.347
- Are you stupid?
You're a great parent!

02:28.349 --> 02:30.348
And your kids know it.
Don't you, guys?

02:31.619 --> 02:33.585
They know it. They do.
- Hmm.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.620
God, I just feel like
I'm hanging on by a thread

02:35.689 --> 02:38.856
Right now, you know--
jesus christ! Ow!

02:38.893 --> 02:40.459
- You're not hanging on
by a thread.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.794
You're a goddamn powerhouse!
- I appreciate that, I think,

02:42.796 --> 02:45.197
I just, I-I have been
disappointing people--

02:45.199 --> 02:47.298
God! Could you stop
doing that?!

02:48.335 --> 02:49.968
- You run a small empire,

02:50.103 --> 02:51.737
And still manage to make dinner
for your kids.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.304
- Most nights.
- Most nights, yes.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.874
- I don't know--
- you're literally wonder woman.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.275
- Am I though?
- You're--

02:57.344 --> 02:59.310
- Bu--anne, I swear to god,
if you slap me again...

02:59.346 --> 03:01.947
- Okay, I'm sorry, god!

03:02.082 --> 03:03.348
- (sighs)

03:03.384 --> 03:06.484
- My head hurts.
- Shit.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.353
- Well, it's a good thing
we got roadies

03:08.355 --> 03:11.123
For the trip, buddy!
Off we go.

03:11.258 --> 03:12.290
- Okay.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.092
- Listen to me!
- Oh, boy.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.827
- You are at your best
when you're kicking ass,

03:15.829 --> 03:17.195
And you're not making
compromises for anybody.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.896
- Yeah.
- Don't your kids deserve you

03:18.933 --> 03:20.232
At your best?
- Yeah.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.633
- Kate!
- Yes.

03:21.768 --> 03:23.569
- Kate!
- Yes! Yes!

03:23.704 --> 03:25.870
- Then let's fuckin' go!
- Okay! Yes!

03:25.906 --> 03:28.106
- These kids! Anyone needs 'em,
they'll be at school!

03:28.108 --> 03:29.641
- That's right,
and if anyone needs me,

03:29.710 --> 03:31.376
I'll be at work
kicking ass, let's go!

03:31.512 --> 03:33.044
- Yes! Go!
- Let's go!

03:33.113 --> 03:35.046
- Yeah, I got the bags.
- Let's go, I got the kids.

03:35.115 --> 03:36.381
- Let's go, come on, kids.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.016
- You got the bags,
I got the kids.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.851
- Let's go! Let's go.
- Go! Go! Come on, guys!

03:39.920 --> 03:41.720
- You're not sick. Come on!
- No, you're not sick!

03:41.789 --> 03:43.388
You're fine, come on,
my friend!

03:43.390 --> 03:45.356
- You're not sick. Woo!
- Woo-hoo! Let's go!

03:47.261 --> 03:48.526
I'm so hyped right now.

03:48.528 --> 03:50.061
Let's get hyped, all right?

03:50.130 --> 03:52.196
Hype! Hype! Hype!
- You all right, foster?

03:52.233 --> 03:53.999
I feel like I'm in a locker
room on game day.

03:54.068 --> 03:56.001
- Listen up, alright, this
marion davenport interview

03:56.136 --> 03:57.535
Is just a couple days away.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.604
- I still can't believe
she reached out about rebecca.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.307
Her viewership is--
- is massive, I know.

04:02.442 --> 04:04.409
- Come on, ladies.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.612
Her numbers are high just
because she's controversial.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.748
She'll dig up dirt on anything.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.716
I've said it before,
I'll say it again,

04:11.851 --> 04:14.018
This interview is not
a good idea.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.154
- Disagree, all publicity's
good publicity.

04:16.156 --> 04:18.557
- You know it's literally your
job to know that's not true?

04:18.692 --> 04:21.025
- Look, as much as it pains me
to say this,

04:21.061 --> 04:22.694
I agree with mo.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.296
- Appreciate it.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.431
- At least on this one
and very unusual instance.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.266
But richard, you're not wrong.

04:28.269 --> 04:29.668
Davenport loves a scandal.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.836
Which is why we need to make
sure that rebecca

04:31.905 --> 04:33.905
Is bulletproof.
I know she's young,

04:33.974 --> 04:35.707
And she's got the best of
intentions with this book,

04:35.743 --> 04:37.575
But that doesn't mean
she's squeaky clean.

04:37.645 --> 04:40.178
So we need to dig up everything
we can find on her.

04:40.180 --> 04:41.680
I want to know if she was mean
at sleepovers.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.315
Did she ever pee in the pool?

04:43.317 --> 04:45.149
Does she wipe back to front?
- Good lord!

04:45.185 --> 04:46.784
- None of that seems relevant.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.787
- I need all hands on deck,
no excuses, no distractions.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.523
(cell phone buzzes)

04:54.261 --> 04:55.694
(cell phone buzzes)

04:57.097 --> 04:58.930
It's just that it's my kids'
school, so.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.265
Hello? Uh-huh.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.869
You sure?
- (blows raspberry)

05:04.938 --> 05:06.604
- Because they've been known
to lie.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.473
Really?

05:08.475 --> 05:11.209
No, they were fine,
they were totally fine, yeah.

05:11.278 --> 05:12.410
Okay.

05:12.479 --> 05:15.313
Thank you.
- (clears throat)

05:15.349 --> 05:17.282
- I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

05:17.284 --> 05:18.750
Everything you can find,
just dig it up.

05:18.885 --> 05:21.119
Dig! Dig! Dig! Dig! Dig!
No distractions!

05:21.254 --> 05:23.155
<i> No distractions!</i>
<i> How are you?</i>

05:23.157 --> 05:25.223
- Peeing in the pool is not
that big of a deal.

05:27.628 --> 05:30.461
- You mean to tell me
they were 100% healthy

05:30.497 --> 05:32.364
When they woke up this morning?

05:32.499 --> 05:34.432
- I mean, healthy as a couple
of horses!

05:34.468 --> 05:36.501
That's what makes this
so crazy.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.170
- Mm-hmm.

05:38.172 --> 05:40.004
- Anyway, you know how kids
are, though, right?

05:40.074 --> 05:41.406
I mean, one second they're
fine, and the next,

05:41.541 --> 05:43.475
They're a couple of walking
petri dishes.

05:43.544 --> 05:46.110
Charlie: I was coughing
a lot last night.

05:46.112 --> 05:48.113
- Yeah, he's--
he's a goddamn liar.

05:48.248 --> 05:49.915
His sister's always saying it.
Anyway, listen,

05:49.917 --> 05:51.917
Thank you so much for letting
me know under these wildly

05:52.052 --> 05:53.952
Unexpected circumstances.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.854
I'll be sure to get them
in bed early tonight. Okay?

05:55.989 --> 05:57.756
- Are-are you leaving?

05:57.891 --> 05:59.458
- Was there something else
you needed?

05:59.593 --> 06:01.859
- Yes, you need to take
them home!

06:01.895 --> 06:03.528
- Yeah, no, they're coming
with me, of course.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.363
I was just making sure
my car's still there.

06:05.366 --> 06:06.798
All right, guys,
let's head home

06:06.933 --> 06:08.800
And have some chicken soup,
what do you say, get cozy?

06:08.935 --> 06:11.469
Thank you so much.
Okay, come on.

06:11.538 --> 06:14.172
- Bye-bye.
- Are we going home now?

06:15.609 --> 06:17.141
- Yes, we just have to make
a quick pitstop at the office,

06:17.177 --> 06:18.977
And then we'll go home, okay?

06:19.112 --> 06:20.845
- Unbelievable.

06:22.416 --> 06:23.815
- Chicken soup!

06:23.950 --> 06:25.750
Straight out of the microwave!

06:25.786 --> 06:28.420
- That's what I'm talking
about, thanks, rosie!

06:28.555 --> 06:30.388
- Kate, are you sure
you don't wanna go home?

06:30.391 --> 06:31.957
Mo and I I'm sure can handle
all of the--

06:31.959 --> 06:33.625
- Uh-uh, this book is my baby,
richard.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.527
I'm not going anywhere.
- Aren't they your babies?

06:35.596 --> 06:37.429
- Yeah, of course.
Uh, but... You know,

06:37.431 --> 06:39.230
And I love those babies,
but sometimes,

06:39.266 --> 06:40.565
One baby needs more attention
than the other baby,

06:40.634 --> 06:42.233
Which is okay, really,

06:42.302 --> 06:43.635
As long as all the babies
are feeling good.

06:43.704 --> 06:46.137
- My tummy hurts.
- Shh!

06:46.206 --> 06:47.506
What do you got?

06:47.641 --> 06:49.841
- Well, uh, rebecca's
reputation is pretty spotless.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.576
Graduated top of class.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.378
Adored by her colleagues.
- Great.

06:53.447 --> 06:55.913
- She even fosters
terminal dogs.

06:55.949 --> 06:58.550
- Oh! I love terminal dogs!

06:58.619 --> 07:00.785
- Uh, why do I feel
a "but" coming?

07:00.788 --> 07:03.354
- Uh, but she's a homewrecker.
- What?!

07:03.424 --> 07:05.523
- Yeah, had an affair
with a married man.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.459
- No!
- He left his wife for her.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.061
They're still together,
but the optics aren't great.

07:10.130 --> 07:13.130
- God, a woman's personal life
always supersedes her resumé.

07:13.167 --> 07:15.333
What are the chances we can
keep this under wraps?

07:15.335 --> 07:17.002
- Not high.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.569
Have you guys seen this?

07:20.073 --> 07:22.406
- And instead of worrying about
the hard-working women

07:22.443 --> 07:24.075
Of goldie's goodness,

07:24.077 --> 07:27.111
Rebecca anderson should
consider the poor woman

07:27.181 --> 07:29.747
Whose husband she ran
away with.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.749
<i> Well, I have considered</i>
<i> that poor woman,</i>

07:31.819 --> 07:33.751
<i> And to ease her pain,</i>

07:33.787 --> 07:36.721
I have sent her a year's supply
of my entire product line.

07:36.723 --> 07:38.990
- She conveniently left out
the part about their marriage

07:39.026 --> 07:41.225
Being loveless and miserable!
This is bullshit!

07:41.261 --> 07:43.161
- Hey, we can handle this.
- How?

07:43.296 --> 07:45.497
I'm about to release a book
that challenges the integrity

07:45.632 --> 07:47.331
Of these companies,

07:47.367 --> 07:49.100
And my personal integrity
just got obliterated!

07:49.102 --> 07:50.768
I can't do this interview!

07:50.804 --> 07:53.237
- And that is absolutely
your decision to make.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.507
- It is, but doing this
interview might also be

07:55.509 --> 07:56.841
The smartest thing you can do
right now.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.943
- Agreed.
- Is it?

07:58.979 --> 08:01.279
- It is, and here's why.
Hey, what-- (knocking)

08:01.348 --> 08:03.080
Oh! (chuckles)

08:03.116 --> 08:05.316
- Are they... Yours?
- They are, sorry.

08:05.385 --> 08:06.718
The school called and said,

08:06.787 --> 08:08.586
They were a little bit
under the weather,

08:08.588 --> 08:10.522
But you know, schools can be
very dramatic. Sorry, guys.

08:10.524 --> 08:13.124
Why don't you guys stay
in the kitchen?

08:13.126 --> 08:14.926
Okay, guys, we're gonna be
really, really quiet,

08:15.061 --> 08:16.661
Because mommy's in a very
important meeting.

08:16.730 --> 08:19.231
This never happens.
Here we go, look at this.

08:19.366 --> 08:21.365
We'll do some drawings.
(awkward laugh)

08:22.669 --> 08:24.502
Yeah, it's fun, right?
Here you go.

08:24.538 --> 08:26.270
Very, very quiet.

08:26.306 --> 08:27.605
Kids, am I right?

08:27.674 --> 08:30.208
- I wouldn't know.
- Sure, yeah. Anyway.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.344
Uh, listen, the point
I was trying to make

08:32.346 --> 08:34.079
Is that you have to take
control of the narrative.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.813
You're about to launch
your career,

08:35.849 --> 08:37.815
And you've got an important
story to tell.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.817
And as your pr rep,
I can make sure davenport

08:39.819 --> 08:41.753
Doesn't get anywhere near
your personal life.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.288
- Yeah, well, hang on.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.090
Wouldn't it be smarter
to be transparent?

08:45.092 --> 08:47.092
- Absolutely not, because women
don't forgive women

08:47.094 --> 08:49.227
For having affairs.
- I don't know.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.795
Right person, wrong time,

08:50.831 --> 08:52.898
I think the public would
appreciate rebecca's honesty.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.665
- We don't engage, mo,
it's a distraction.

08:54.701 --> 08:58.202
- Part of controlling the
narrative is owning up
to the truth.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.004
- The conversation's over
because I already made
a decision.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.840
- I'm sorry, do I have
a say in this?

09:01.842 --> 09:03.407
- Yeah--
- of course you do.

09:03.443 --> 09:05.176
Of course she does.
Mo and I will sidebar this,

09:05.312 --> 09:06.778
And put together an integrated
strategy

09:06.847 --> 09:08.780
Hat we'll present to you.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.649
We won't do anything
until we get your sign-off.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.717
The important thing to know
is that we got you covered.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.719
(ella retches, mo squeals)
- oh my god!

09:14.755 --> 09:16.621
Kate: Oh no, honey, are you--
- mommy.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.990
- Oh! Did it get on your shoe?
(laughs nervously)

09:19.125 --> 09:21.058

09:21.194 --> 09:22.693
Shit. Um...

09:23.897 --> 09:26.397
Rosie, could you do me
a favour?

09:26.433 --> 09:28.199
- Hmm? Uh, yeah.
- No, no, no, I got that.

09:28.201 --> 09:30.368
But could you um...
Do something else?

09:33.307 --> 09:35.039
Lause)

09:36.743 --> 09:38.743
- Thank you, penelope,
for that stirring speech

09:38.779 --> 09:41.146
About your twin sister, josie.
- Which one's yours?

09:41.148 --> 09:42.814
- Up next is nathan podeski.

09:42.883 --> 09:45.183
- Uh... Oh! That one.
Right there.

09:45.318 --> 09:46.985
(woman laughs)

09:48.822 --> 09:52.023
- When we were asked to speak
about someone we admire,

09:52.059 --> 09:54.425
I immediately thought
of my stepmom.

09:54.494 --> 09:56.428
After my mom died,

09:56.430 --> 09:58.663
She took me in like I was one
of her own.

09:58.798 --> 10:00.465
- God bless you.

10:00.467 --> 10:02.166
- Thank you.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.235
- But I don't see why
I'm doing this

10:04.304 --> 10:06.571
When she can't even
be bothered to be here.

10:06.573 --> 10:08.440
- So you're not his stepmom?
- Shhh! Shh!

10:08.442 --> 10:10.041
Watch the show.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.711
- Anyway, I guess the speech
can be about someone

10:13.747 --> 10:15.513
I used to admire,

10:15.515 --> 10:17.682
So what can I tell you
about kate?

10:17.684 --> 10:19.917
She works in pr, which means
that she's good at making

10:20.053 --> 10:22.520
People believe things
that aren't true.

10:22.589 --> 10:24.923
Which makes a lot of sense now.

10:25.058 --> 10:28.126
Um, she has two kids,

10:28.128 --> 10:30.061
And a-a kinda nice car,

10:30.097 --> 10:32.597
So there's that, um...

10:32.599 --> 10:35.200
That's not really important,
but...

10:35.202 --> 10:37.135
I can't really think
of anything else, so.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.870

- What are you, a detective?
(chuckles)

16:19.212 --> 16:21.045
Who wants popcorn
and a movie?

16:21.114 --> 16:23.081
Charlie and ella: Yeah!
- Yes!

16:23.216 --> 16:25.183
That's what we're gonna do.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.451
- Rebecca anderson,
journalist,

16:27.487 --> 16:29.954
And soon-to-be published
author, welcome.

16:29.956 --> 16:31.556
- Thank you so much
for having me.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.625
- First, let me congratulate
you on your upcoming exposé.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.460
Multi-level misconduct.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.696
I'm a few chapters in, and...
(cell phone buzzes)

16:38.698 --> 16:40.664
Wow, what a fascinating...
- Kate?

16:40.700 --> 16:42.400
- Rosie, what the fuck's
going on over there?

16:42.535 --> 16:45.536
- Marion just congratulated
rebecca on the upcoming exposé.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.305
- Great, they're on the book,
okay, okay.

16:47.307 --> 16:49.907
<i> - You know, I really think</i>
<i> mo's got this under control.</i>

16:49.909 --> 16:52.243
And it's probably good for you
to take the day with your kids.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.679
- Not helpful, just um,
uh, put me on speaker phone.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.781
Rebecca: What I wanted
to accomplish with this book.

16:56.916 --> 16:58.916
The human toll.

16:58.918 --> 17:01.519
- Of course, but before
we get into the book,

17:01.521 --> 17:03.654
<i>I'd be remiss not to bring up--</i>

17:03.690 --> 17:05.389
- No! Pass.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.224
- Kate? Is that kate?

17:07.226 --> 17:09.726
Uh-I think I'm--
I-I'm okay right now.

17:09.763 --> 17:11.528
- It's a trap!
Just--whatever she says--

17:11.664 --> 17:13.531
Stick to the book, davenport!
(oil hisses, sizzles)

17:13.600 --> 17:15.499
Ow! Shit! Fuck!

17:15.568 --> 17:17.301
- I'm sorry, who is that?

17:17.437 --> 17:19.169
- Kate foster,
of kate foster pr.

17:19.205 --> 17:20.938
I-I'm rebecca's rep.

17:21.074 --> 17:23.207
- Can I have butter
on my popcorn?

17:23.209 --> 17:25.142
<i>- Of course you can, sweetie,</i>
<i> yes, yes, yes.</i>

17:25.211 --> 17:27.144
<i> Just one sec, okay,</i>
<i> just one sec.</i>

17:27.213 --> 17:29.213
- Hey, kate, look,
you sound awfully busy.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.215
<i>So why don't we call you back</i>
<i> when this is all done?</i>

17:31.217 --> 17:33.551
- Yeah, how about mo tells me
what's on the no-ask list?

17:33.553 --> 17:35.219
- Sorry, there's a no-ask list?

17:35.221 --> 17:38.021
- Oh! You haven't been given
a no-ask list?!

17:38.058 --> 17:39.557
- I want water.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.158
- Yes, sweetie,
yeah, one sec, one sec,

17:41.227 --> 17:43.193
<i> I'll get it for you in like,</i>
<i> five seconds.</i>

17:43.229 --> 17:45.095
- Look kate, you said the day
you're gone, I get--

17:45.097 --> 17:46.430
- I meant the day
I was dead, mo!

17:46.466 --> 17:48.132
- We've got this under control,
foster.

17:48.267 --> 17:50.234
Rebecca's been briefed,
and she's fine with it.

17:50.369 --> 17:52.303
To not address her relationship
would be insane.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.204
- No, what's insane is to bring
something so personal

17:54.240 --> 17:56.240
Into a story that has
absolutely nothing to do

17:56.242 --> 17:58.576
With rebecca's personal life!
- About that,

17:58.578 --> 18:00.944
Is it true that your partner's
ex-wife had cancer

18:00.980 --> 18:02.513
When you started the affair?

18:02.582 --> 18:04.582
- I think something's burning.
- Don't answer that!

18:04.651 --> 18:06.517
And-and you know what?
As rebecca's pr rep,

18:06.652 --> 18:09.053
I will shut this thing down
so fast if any--

18:09.122 --> 18:10.787
(flames crackle)

18:10.824 --> 18:14.057
Oh my god! Oh my god!
Oh shit!

18:14.094 --> 18:16.193
Okay, watch out, watch out.
Um-ugh!

18:16.262 --> 18:17.995
(fire whooshes)

18:17.997 --> 18:19.597
<i> Oh god! Uh, uh--</i>
<i> (smoke alarm beeps)</i>

18:19.599 --> 18:21.165
- What's that sound?

18:21.300 --> 18:23.000
- Kate, is that the fire alarm?

18:23.136 --> 18:24.569
- Oh my god, is your house
on fire?

18:24.704 --> 18:26.037
- Kate, get the kids
and get out!

18:26.172 --> 18:28.239
- Ow! Ow!

18:28.374 --> 18:31.441
Ow! Fuck! (lid clangs)
ow! Ow! Ow! Shit!

18:31.478 --> 18:33.945
(smoke alarm beeps)
(breath hitches)

18:33.947 --> 18:35.213
- Kate?

18:35.348 --> 18:37.615
(taps call off)
- okay, let's continue, huh?

18:37.617 --> 18:40.217
- So listen, uh, as long
as you stick to the book,

18:40.286 --> 18:43.020
And rebecca's career,
we should be fine.

18:43.022 --> 18:44.421
(fire alarm beeping)
hello?

18:45.691 --> 18:47.425
God damn it, mo!

18:47.427 --> 18:49.927
- Kate? Your arm.

18:50.062 --> 18:51.929
(smoke alarm continues to beep)

19:02.308 --> 19:03.975
Tantly)

19:03.977 --> 19:06.243
- Agh! (winces)
thank you.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.313
Jesus fucking christ.
I'm sorry, I--

19:09.349 --> 19:11.915
- It's okay.
Look, these-these...

19:11.951 --> 19:13.283
- Oh.

19:13.319 --> 19:16.119
- Consider yourself lucky.
A first-degree burn.

19:16.156 --> 19:17.788
- Yeah, it was just a dumb
accident, I--

19:17.857 --> 19:19.657
- Well, it's actually not
that uncommon,

19:19.659 --> 19:21.659
But I've seen this story
play out much worse.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.594
And it's often in women
your age.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.397
- Women my age?

19:26.532 --> 19:28.399
(scoffs) sorry, but uh,
what do you mean?

19:28.401 --> 19:30.401
- Juggling too many things?
- No, not really.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.703
Just normal things.
- It's hard to slow down.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.438
But the stress catches up,

19:34.440 --> 19:37.808
And it can lead to high blood
pressure, insomnia,

19:37.810 --> 19:39.810
Accidents like the one
you just had.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.345
- Sorry, so what are you
suggesting,

19:41.347 --> 19:43.347
That I uh, that I quit working?

19:43.349 --> 19:45.349
- (laughs)
I can't tell you what to do.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.150
But after an event like this,

19:47.187 --> 19:49.319
A lot of people feel
the need to reassess.

19:50.590 --> 19:53.624
Okay. And I'll be back with
the ointment for the pain.

19:55.127 --> 19:57.061
<i> (muffled announcement over pa)</i>

19:57.063 --> 19:59.563
- What kind of bullshit
diagnosis was that?

20:00.767 --> 20:02.300
You know?

20:02.435 --> 20:04.368
(chair rattles)

20:04.370 --> 20:06.437
- Sounds like she thinks you...

20:06.439 --> 20:08.439
Might be a workaholic.
- (laughs)

20:08.508 --> 20:10.207
Well, that's ridiculous.
- Is it?

20:10.210 --> 20:11.943
- Yes, it is, obviously.

20:12.078 --> 20:13.911
(cell phone buzzes)

20:14.046 --> 20:16.179
Well... Speak of the devil.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.383
Work. Now, if I was
a workaholic,

20:19.385 --> 20:21.652
Would I be able to ignore
this call?

20:21.688 --> 20:23.788
Probably not.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.389
You know what?

20:25.391 --> 20:27.357
Take it. Take my phone.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.192
- Kate, come on.
- No, seriously.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.928
Take it, I don't need it.
Here.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.663
I should probably put it
on "away,"

20:32.732 --> 20:34.398
If I don't put like,
an auto thing, then people--

20:34.400 --> 20:36.166
- Uh-huh.
- You know.

20:37.803 --> 20:39.537
- Okay. Yeah.
Take it.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.339
Is that a--

20:41.474 --> 20:43.474
- You sure about this?
- Yeah, yeah.

20:44.777 --> 20:45.876
Why wouldn't I be sure?
Yeah.

20:45.878 --> 20:46.610
Why wouldn't I be sure?
Yeah.

20:47.647 --> 20:48.479
- Okay, I'm gonna grab you
some water.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.414
- Okay, okay.
