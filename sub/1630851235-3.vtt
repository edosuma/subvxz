WEBVTT

01:15.727 --> 01:18.208
-The work of
Ishido Tsuburaya,

01:18.252 --> 01:20.167
a contemporary of such
Meiji era horror masteries,

01:20.210 --> 01:24.127
as Beguwa and Yoshi-Doshi.

01:24.171 --> 01:26.260
Tsuburaya's renderings
of Japanese ghosts and monsters

01:26.303 --> 01:28.479
made all other artists
look tame by comparison.

01:28.523 --> 01:30.177
-Oh, that's nasty.

01:30.220 --> 01:31.656
-Some say
Tsuburaya's demons

01:31.700 --> 01:35.660
depict man's inner cruelty.
Or, perhaps his own.

01:35.704 --> 01:38.228
-Whoa, ew.

01:38.272 --> 01:40.709
- Your ancestor was not known
for being a pleasant man.

01:42.450 --> 01:46.671
Hmm, your reaction is much like
the people of his time.

01:46.715 --> 01:50.849
They were horrified,
but they couldn't look away.

01:50.893 --> 01:53.852
Tsuburaya actually reveled
in their discomfort.

01:53.896 --> 01:56.464
- No kidding.

01:56.507 --> 01:59.206
- I'm assuming
you're unfamiliar with his work.

01:59.249 --> 02:02.948
- I think I'd remember
seeing that before.

02:02.992 --> 02:06.343
And I'm supposed to be
related to this guy?

02:06.387 --> 02:07.736
- Took some research,

02:07.779 --> 02:09.694
on the part of Mr. Duclon
and his legal team,

02:09.738 --> 02:14.699
but they have determined that
you are the last descendant

02:14.743 --> 02:17.311
of Ishido Tsuburaya.

02:19.269 --> 02:21.619
- And as the last descendant,

02:21.663 --> 02:25.406
Bobby, you are heir
to an intriguing legacy.

02:25.449 --> 02:27.190
Now the bulk
of Tsuburaya's artwork

02:27.234 --> 02:29.105
has been carefully catalogued.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.455
Thanks largely, to Dr. Sato,
and her team

02:31.499 --> 02:34.763
at Tokyo's Ota Museum of Art.

02:34.806 --> 02:38.680
However, there is one
notable exception.

02:38.723 --> 02:40.203
This final piece,

02:40.247 --> 02:42.684
discovered in a monastery
at the base of Mount Fuji.

02:42.727 --> 02:46.340
-Inside this crate
is the fabled last Tsuburaya.

02:46.383 --> 02:49.299
A painting never seen by anyone,
except for the artist himself.

02:49.343 --> 02:50.561
We consider this

02:50.605 --> 02:53.216
a lost jewel
of Japanese culture.

02:53.260 --> 02:54.609
We've been able
to decipher most

02:54.652 --> 02:57.742
of this ancient text,
only recently.

02:58.569 --> 03:01.006
And in accordance
to the artist's wishes,

03:01.050 --> 03:03.748
on the hundredth anniversary
of his death,

03:03.792 --> 03:07.491
the painting is to pass to
members of his surviving family.

03:07.535 --> 03:09.232
If any.
- Me?

03:09.276 --> 03:12.670
- Recent interest in the last
Tsuburaya has been global.

03:12.714 --> 03:15.934
Even from a certain notorious
art collector in Moscow.

03:15.978 --> 03:17.545
- Wow.
- Bottom line,

03:17.588 --> 03:20.896
some wealthy people will pay
handsomely for this piece.

03:20.939 --> 03:23.377
- Well, my museum is very
interested in acquiring it.

03:23.420 --> 03:26.249
I hope we can come to terms.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.337
- This is crazy.

03:27.381 --> 03:29.078
One second, I'm some guy

03:29.121 --> 03:30.645
working at a Best Buy
in Fullerton, then,

03:30.688 --> 03:33.256
suddenly, I've got
a pot of gold in front of me.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.605
-Chicken feed.

03:34.649 --> 03:37.521
I can do much better,
then that.

03:37.565 --> 03:39.523
-Excuse me,
this is a private meeting.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.743
- Wade Cruise.

03:41.786 --> 03:43.745
Mr. Cruise has a penchant
for absconding with artwork

03:43.788 --> 03:46.008
the museum had hoped to acquire.

03:46.051 --> 03:49.011
- Hello, Mai.
- Oh Gisa,

03:49.054 --> 03:52.362
I heard you were
Mr. Cruise's newest acquisition.

03:52.406 --> 03:55.235
I mean your paintings,
of course.

03:55.278 --> 03:57.498
- Well, you're lookin' good Mai.

03:57.541 --> 03:59.978
I'm sorry you lost out
on the Tsuburaya.

04:00.022 --> 04:01.980
- Oh, I haven't made my offer,
yet.

04:02.024 --> 04:04.244
- Won't matter.

04:05.114 --> 04:06.333
- Whatever Wade.

04:06.376 --> 04:08.160
- Wait a minute,
the Wade Cruise,

04:08.204 --> 04:09.945
the tech mega-billionaire?

04:09.988 --> 04:13.296
- And for today only, the genie
who's about to make your life

04:13.340 --> 04:15.385
so much richer.

04:15.429 --> 04:17.561
Probably want
to thank me in advance.

04:21.783 --> 04:23.524
No, seriously.

04:23.567 --> 04:25.090
Gonna wanna do that.

04:25.134 --> 04:26.440
- Thank...you?

04:26.483 --> 04:29.443
- You're welcome.

04:30.357 --> 04:33.577
If you know anything about the
contemporary art scene, which,

04:33.621 --> 04:36.754
I find unlikely.

04:36.798 --> 04:39.017
You know the
ground-breaking artist, Gisa.

04:39.061 --> 04:40.410
Her pieces have sold

04:40.454 --> 04:42.847
for hundreds
of thousands of dollars until,

04:42.891 --> 04:46.721
until I gave her a chance
to create exclusively for me.

04:46.764 --> 04:48.331
- Good deal.

04:48.375 --> 04:51.029
- The man knows what he likes.
-Yeah, well.

04:51.073 --> 04:52.988
But let's talk about you.
- Bobby.

04:53.031 --> 04:54.685
- Sure.

04:54.729 --> 04:59.081
Now uh, you could auction off
this precious windfall.

04:59.124 --> 05:00.735
Watch the auctioneers
and the lawyers

05:00.778 --> 05:03.041
gobble up chunks
of your good fortune.

05:03.085 --> 05:05.305
But, why?
Y'know, you seem like a,

05:05.348 --> 05:07.481
smart guy.

05:07.524 --> 05:10.266
I mean we can,
we can handle this right now.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.355
Cut out the middleman
and all the rewards

05:12.399 --> 05:14.662
go to you.

05:14.705 --> 05:18.100
Gisa, if you please.

05:20.798 --> 05:25.586
1-1-3-3-4 dash 1-8-2-4.

05:25.629 --> 05:27.327
- Wait, that's my
bank account number.

05:27.370 --> 05:30.025
-Yes, it is.
And with one click,

05:30.068 --> 05:31.679
20 million, poof,

05:31.722 --> 05:33.637
magically appears
in your bank account.

05:33.681 --> 05:34.638
And it's all yours.

05:34.682 --> 05:37.162
- Just for this?
- One provision.

05:37.206 --> 05:40.296
You hand over the Tsuburaya,
sight unseen.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.124
Still in the crate.

05:42.167 --> 05:44.996
- I don't get to see it?
- Not a peek.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.389
Deal?

05:46.433 --> 05:48.391
- It belongs in a museum,
for all to see it.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.872
- Well that's,
that's certainly,

05:50.915 --> 05:54.223
certainly an option,
Mai.

05:54.266 --> 05:56.878
I'm sure your museum could
scrape together enough to make

05:56.921 --> 06:00.490
old Bobby here
a decent profit.

06:00.534 --> 06:04.276
If it's a painting
the people want to see.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.496
- What do you mean?
- Tsuburaya was

06:06.540 --> 06:11.066
renowned for the vivid monsters
he captured on canvas.

06:11.109 --> 06:14.025
Collectors have paid fortunes
to own them.

06:14.069 --> 06:18.247
Kappa, of Kappa-Buchi Pool,
sold to a Russian investor

06:18.290 --> 06:24.035
in 2018 for uh,
9, 9.3 millio- 9.3 million.

06:24.079 --> 06:25.733
- Cool.

06:25.776 --> 06:28.736
- But what you didn't know
is that Tsuburaya was also

06:28.779 --> 06:32.522
renowned for painting
butterflies, trees,

06:32.566 --> 06:35.395
and glorious landscapes.
Now, lovely.

06:35.438 --> 06:40.008
But worthless to the
hardcore Tsuburaya fan base.

06:40.051 --> 06:42.445
Now, what you got here
could be

06:42.489 --> 06:45.143
a bloodcurdling demon,
hello early retirement,

06:45.187 --> 06:49.017
or a
pagoda at sunset,

06:49.060 --> 06:53.195
$100 tax write-off
from Dr. Sato's museum.

06:53.238 --> 06:56.590
Yeah, it's a,
oof, it's a crap-shoot.

06:56.633 --> 06:57.939
Right?

06:57.982 --> 07:00.202
The only sure way you win

07:00.245 --> 07:02.813
is to sell to Wade.

07:05.990 --> 07:07.949
Fine.
Good luck findin' someone else

07:07.992 --> 07:09.820
to give you 10 million
for your mystery box.

07:09.864 --> 07:10.908
- Didn't you say 20 million?

07:10.952 --> 07:13.171
- Ask me again,
and it's five.

07:13.215 --> 07:16.305
I know the good doctor's museum
couldn't come close to that sum.

07:16.348 --> 07:17.567
Last chance, Best Buy.

07:17.611 --> 07:20.396
- Yes, yes take it.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.181
- Domo arigato.
It's Japanese for thank you.

07:23.225 --> 07:25.793
- Oh, go to hell.
- Aw, come on, Mai.

07:25.836 --> 07:28.491
No hard feelings.
Yeah?

07:28.535 --> 07:31.712
You know, I uh, I'm having a
private unveiling tonight,

07:31.755 --> 07:33.235
and I would

07:33.278 --> 07:35.498
very much like
for you to attend.

07:35.542 --> 07:38.458
You know, first and only chance
for you to see the Tsuburaya

07:38.501 --> 07:42.070
before I,
lock her away, huh?

07:44.159 --> 07:46.248
Think about it.

07:52.863 --> 07:54.909
Pleasure's been all yours.

07:58.608 --> 08:00.392
-See ya tonight, Mai.

08:39.736 --> 08:41.433
- Quiet, please! Shh!

08:42.652 --> 08:46.003
The master's work,
revealed.

09:09.679 --> 09:12.203
Please.

09:12.943 --> 09:15.555
Private moment.

09:16.817 --> 09:20.864
Magnificent.
The power.

09:20.908 --> 09:23.345
The daring.

09:23.388 --> 09:29.133
The ultimate fusion
of passion and of nightmare.

09:30.657 --> 09:35.096
Without question.

09:35.139 --> 09:39.970
Tsuburaya's masterpiece,
the world has never,

09:40.014 --> 09:45.454
ever, seen...
its like before.

09:47.717 --> 09:51.591
-Nor will it ever again.

10:26.147 --> 10:27.757
- What have you done?

10:27.801 --> 10:29.193
- Uh, blow torch.

10:29.237 --> 10:32.544
- It's irreplaceable.
- That's kinda the point.

10:32.588 --> 10:36.679
- I've waited my entire life
to see the final Tsuburaya.

10:36.723 --> 10:40.640
- Well, you uh,
you missed a good one.

10:40.683 --> 10:42.293
Um, I think...

10:42.337 --> 10:44.513
Yeah, I-I think you can
still see just a little bit

10:44.556 --> 10:46.689
of the foot there, or,
maybe that's not a foot.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.343
- But why?
- To have an experience,

10:48.386 --> 10:51.041
only I can buy.

10:51.085 --> 10:54.610
To be the one and only person

10:54.654 --> 10:57.526
to ever see the last Tsuburaya.

10:58.701 --> 11:01.617
It now exists in the most
exclusive gallery of all...

11:03.532 --> 11:06.317
my mind.

11:06.361 --> 11:07.667
- You know, for all your money,

11:07.710 --> 11:09.320
for all the good
that you can do,

11:09.364 --> 11:11.714
how sad is it that you find
joy through destruction, huh?

11:11.758 --> 11:13.890
- Well.

11:13.934 --> 11:18.373
- Your inhumanity rivals that
of Tsuburaya himself.

11:19.679 --> 11:23.030
- Well, I had a great time.

11:23.073 --> 11:26.250
Thank you for comin'.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

11:26.294 --> 11:30.559
All right people,
time to leave, let's go.

11:31.603 --> 11:33.867
Let's go, party's over.
Thanks for coming.

11:33.910 --> 11:36.478
You guys were all wonderful,
thank you so much.

11:36.521 --> 11:39.307
Had a really great time.
Thank you, thank you.

11:39.350 --> 11:42.005
Thank you, door's that way.

11:42.049 --> 11:43.615
- That's some patron you have.

11:43.659 --> 11:44.834
Can't wait to see your face,

11:44.878 --> 11:47.445
when he starts burning
your artwork.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.018
- M'lady.

11:57.629 --> 11:59.675
Get outta here.

12:00.807 --> 12:03.984
Oh, so good.

12:04.027 --> 12:07.465
The look
on those slack-jawed faces

12:07.509 --> 12:10.251
were worth more
than that painting.

12:10.294 --> 12:15.256
Yea-almost,
almost.

12:17.301 --> 12:21.392
Woo, feel alive!

12:27.050 --> 12:29.836
- You had to do it again,
didn't you?

12:29.879 --> 12:32.186
Buy something unique to destroy,

12:32.229 --> 12:35.232
just so no one else
could have it?

12:35.276 --> 12:36.930
- Always.

12:42.849 --> 12:45.373
So, what's the masterpiece
tonight?

12:45.416 --> 12:47.201
- I'm trying to recreate
the Tsuburaya

12:47.244 --> 12:49.551
based on your vague description.

12:49.594 --> 12:52.946
Good luck with that one.

12:57.907 --> 13:01.258
- Did I ever tell you,
about my first sale?

13:01.302 --> 13:04.087
- Thrill me.

13:04.131 --> 13:09.266
- I was three, it was
a drawing of a cat.

13:09.310 --> 13:13.488
My dad liked it and so,
he bought it for a quarter.

13:13.531 --> 13:16.752
Up until then, I doubt
he even knew he had a daughter.

13:16.796 --> 13:21.975
Hard to be seen in a family of,
four loud, older brothers.

13:24.281 --> 13:27.415
- Only child, can't relate.

13:27.458 --> 13:32.333
- I grew up believing
that no one saw me unless

13:32.376 --> 13:35.510
I created something they valued.
- Hmm.

13:35.553 --> 13:38.905
- What happened to you?

13:38.948 --> 13:44.432
- Well, folks gave me
whatever I wanted,

13:44.475 --> 13:48.871
and when they died,
I got their fortune.

13:48.915 --> 13:53.223
And then,
then something funny happened.

13:53.267 --> 13:56.009
I realized
that simply buying things

13:56.052 --> 13:58.402
because of their money
left me feeling empty.

13:58.446 --> 14:02.363
You know?
No joy, no thrill.

14:02.406 --> 14:05.583
So I could buy
whatever I wanted, big deal.

14:05.627 --> 14:06.976
- Poor baby.
- I know, right?

14:09.022 --> 14:11.546
And then it hit me.

14:11.589 --> 14:13.722
It was so clear.

14:13.765 --> 14:17.117
And so simple.

14:17.160 --> 14:20.207
I was looking, I was looking
for this rare vase.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.950
Found one, valued at 300k.

14:23.993 --> 14:26.517
The owner was grateful
to sell, as...

14:26.561 --> 14:29.738
his daughter needed a new heart
or some shit.

14:30.652 --> 14:33.220
And that was the moment,

14:33.263 --> 14:37.267
I discovered
the true pleasure of money.

14:37.311 --> 14:40.880
I declined the sale,
and the look of,

14:40.923 --> 14:44.666
of desperation on his face
was a revelation.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.929
The pain in his eyes,

14:46.973 --> 14:50.672
that his daughter might die
because of my money,

14:50.715 --> 14:54.981
was like,
fucking crack to me.

14:55.024 --> 14:57.287
- You're a monster.

14:57.331 --> 14:59.420
- I go back with 100k and he

14:59.463 --> 15:02.249
snaps at it,
anything to give the doctor.

15:04.555 --> 15:06.383
There's a good ending to it.

15:06.427 --> 15:11.432
Six months later,
I sell that exact vase,

15:11.475 --> 15:16.654
at an auction, for 1.3 million.

15:16.698 --> 15:19.092
- What happened
to the little girl?

15:19.135 --> 15:22.051
- Not my worry.

15:23.052 --> 15:24.749
- I'm done listening.

15:24.793 --> 15:28.057
- Well, you weren't saying that
when I became your patron.

15:28.101 --> 15:30.407
Huh?

15:30.451 --> 15:33.671
Lot more enriching,

15:33.715 --> 15:36.109
than a quarter from daddy.

15:39.112 --> 15:41.897
Hmm,

15:41.941 --> 15:45.031
had more scales than that.

15:45.074 --> 15:47.642
Maybe.

15:47.685 --> 15:50.427
And uh, he had two horns.

15:52.734 --> 15:55.302
Or did he?

15:58.653 --> 16:02.570
Oh, what a night.

16:25.419 --> 16:27.203
- Yeah, to Tsuburaya.

16:27.247 --> 16:29.466
And our eternal bond.

17:20.735 --> 17:23.738
- Aah.

18:13.004 --> 18:14.919
- No, no.

18:24.625 --> 18:28.150
- Hey, what happened?

18:28.194 --> 18:32.241
- Uh, I...

18:32.285 --> 18:34.374
Louis the XIII.

18:34.417 --> 18:37.159
It's got a,
a hell of a kick.

18:37.203 --> 18:40.293
- Mop it up,
and pour yourself into bed.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.957
- Oh, Wade, Wade, Wade.

19:16.677 --> 19:18.722
- Hey did...

19:18.766 --> 19:20.768
Did you see something?

19:20.811 --> 19:22.204
-No.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.641
The storm's gotten louder.

19:24.685 --> 19:27.470
I've been reading up
on Tsuburaya.

19:27.514 --> 19:30.256
You two
would've been best buds.

19:30.299 --> 19:32.214
His imagery displayed

19:32.258 --> 19:37.437
a deep disdain and contempt
for humanity too.

19:37.480 --> 19:41.484
- Huh, sounds like my kinda guy.

19:52.887 --> 19:54.845
Well,
good night.

19:56.282 --> 19:58.197
- Aah!

19:58.240 --> 19:59.546
-Wade?

20:00.895 --> 20:02.940
What happened?

20:08.424 --> 20:10.557
Wade.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.603
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

20:13.647 --> 20:16.780
Wade,
Wade!

20:16.824 --> 20:19.174
What's going on?

20:19.218 --> 20:20.610
- There's something here.

20:20.654 --> 20:21.916
In the penthouse.

20:21.959 --> 20:23.309
- What?

20:23.352 --> 20:25.267
- The creature
from the painting.

20:25.311 --> 20:26.660
I saw it.

20:26.703 --> 20:28.575
- Have to take your word
for that.

20:28.618 --> 20:31.839
- It's here.
It's here!

20:31.882 --> 20:34.058
- Mm-hmm, I know exactly
what this is.

20:34.102 --> 20:36.539
The guilt
from burning the painting.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.324
The guilt from all
the terrible things

20:38.367 --> 20:41.065
that you've done
has finally built up.

20:41.109 --> 20:43.024
- Guilt is for losers.

20:43.067 --> 20:45.200
- It's called being human!

20:45.244 --> 20:47.289
- Well, then being human
is overrated!

20:49.944 --> 20:51.685
- I'm sleeping,
at my place tonight.

20:51.728 --> 20:54.427
Maybe, every night.

20:54.470 --> 20:56.298
- Really, really?
Your place?

20:56.342 --> 20:57.691
You mean my place?

20:57.734 --> 20:59.301
Cause I'm the one
that paid for it.

20:59.345 --> 21:02.086
- Ah, what are you gonna do?

21:02.130 --> 21:06.569
Send your monster over
to evict me?

21:06.613 --> 21:09.137
Don't bother.

21:09.180 --> 21:11.792
I'll find some place to go.

22:29.565 --> 22:31.872
- Hey, what are you doin' here?

22:31.915 --> 22:35.310
- You, you fucked me over
with that painting.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.399
- Why?
Why, you got what you wanted.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.488
Oh, what, it turned out
to be Lotus blossoms?

22:39.532 --> 22:41.447
- No, it-t-there's
something wrong with it.

22:41.490 --> 22:42.796
You did something to it.

22:42.839 --> 22:44.885
- Fuck you, get the hell
outta my office.

22:44.928 --> 22:46.756
- What no, listen, you have to
do something, please.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.584
- Oh, I will.

22:48.628 --> 22:50.934
I'm callin' security.

23:19.659 --> 23:21.574
- It's alive,
I saw it.

23:21.617 --> 23:22.836
- Get him outta here.

23:22.879 --> 23:24.446
- Wait, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

23:24.490 --> 23:27.449
No hol-hold, wait hold on.
I c-can hurt it.

23:27.493 --> 23:31.148
I can kill it.
Wait.

23:50.864 --> 23:54.041
- Come on out.

23:56.304 --> 24:00.177
- I'm ready for you.
Hi-yaa, hi-yaa.

24:00.221 --> 24:02.658
Huh, you afraid
of a little sword?

24:02.702 --> 24:04.834
You know what that is?

24:56.582 --> 24:59.846
First thing tomorrow,
you fucked-up freak...

25:01.195 --> 25:03.763
..we're visiting the
taxidermist.

25:04.981 --> 25:10.073
Your ugly carcass
is hangin' over my f-

25:10.117 --> 25:12.336
fireplace...

25:21.389 --> 25:25.001
What is this?

25:25.045 --> 25:28.178
- You've released me.
- Tsuburaya?

25:28.222 --> 25:33.488
- On my death, my hatred

25:33.532 --> 25:35.359
trapped me between worlds.

25:35.403 --> 25:40.190
Becoming the image of my most
monstrous creation.

25:42.845 --> 25:47.676
Imprisoned,
until you released me.

25:49.069 --> 25:51.462
My curse is broken.

25:55.902 --> 25:59.122
Now, yours begins.

26:03.649 --> 26:05.651
- Son of a bitch.

26:15.922 --> 26:17.271
- What?

27:59.503 --> 28:01.897
- How ya doin', darlin'?

28:03.420 --> 28:05.509
Here ya go.

28:07.163 --> 28:09.557
What am I gonna call you?

28:09.600 --> 28:13.256
What's the right name
for somethin' as special as you?

28:13.996 --> 28:17.130
-Okay Strick.

28:19.306 --> 28:21.264
It's time.

28:21.308 --> 28:24.833
- Yes, boss.

28:24.877 --> 28:26.748
Dropped my book.

28:34.974 --> 28:37.367
Mr. Elmer Strick,

28:37.411 --> 28:39.413
since you have declined
to have anyone present

28:39.456 --> 28:41.197
to speak on your behalf,

28:41.241 --> 28:44.157
do you have anything
you would like to say?

28:44.200 --> 28:47.900
- No.
What I did was wrong.

28:47.943 --> 28:50.946
In the eyes of the law, that is.

28:50.990 --> 28:53.819
- You were
a licensed pharmacist.

28:53.862 --> 28:56.125
You had the knowledge
and understanding that

28:56.169 --> 28:58.519
the right combination of drugs
would lead to death,

28:58.562 --> 29:00.695
did you not?

29:00.739 --> 29:02.871
- I knew what I was doing.
- Out of some,

29:02.915 --> 29:05.918
fanciful conviction
that it was merciful?

29:05.961 --> 29:07.702
- There was no other way.

29:07.746 --> 29:11.010
I just couldn't
watch her suffer anymore.

29:11.053 --> 29:13.926
- A-apparently,
you have been a model prisoner,

29:13.969 --> 29:15.492
here, Mr. Strick.

29:15.536 --> 29:17.843
And ordinarily, this board
would be sympathetic

29:17.886 --> 29:21.324
to an appeal for parole,
however,

29:22.848 --> 29:27.766
it has come to our attention
that after a confrontation

29:27.809 --> 29:32.031
with another inmate
named Frank Kowalski,

29:32.074 --> 29:35.469
you contaminated his medication
causing a life-threatening

29:35.512 --> 29:40.474
episode of increased heart rate
and drop in blood pressure?

29:40.517 --> 29:41.867
- What?

29:41.910 --> 29:45.435
No, I never had any beef
with Polish Frank.

29:45.479 --> 29:48.090
There must be some-
- I have here a signed affidavit

29:48.134 --> 29:51.833
from corrections officer
Butcher "Bunk" Dill,

29:51.877 --> 29:56.142
stating that you, Mr. Strick,
said you were, quote,

29:56.185 --> 29:58.797
"Gonna get even
with Polish Frank",

29:58.840 --> 30:00.842
right after said confrontation.

30:00.886 --> 30:03.845
You had motive and opportunity,

30:03.889 --> 30:05.716
since you work
in the prison clinic,

30:05.760 --> 30:08.023
where medications are dispensed.

30:08.067 --> 30:11.635
I'm sorry Mr. Strick,
but given this new information,

30:12.593 --> 30:15.117
parole is declined.

30:24.170 --> 30:26.607
-Open up cell block C,
main door.

30:26.650 --> 30:27.782
- What kind of mama's boy,

30:27.826 --> 30:29.740
does such a thing anyway,
Strick?

30:29.784 --> 30:32.439
You some kind of
deranged prevert?

30:34.180 --> 30:35.834
Get in there.

30:35.877 --> 30:38.184
Never woulda done something
like that to my Ma.

30:38.227 --> 30:39.489
Even though she was nothin'

30:39.533 --> 30:42.057
but a drunk whore,
who beat me all the time.

30:44.190 --> 30:46.845
Hey, spider boy.

30:46.888 --> 30:48.629
Thought you were just gonna
skate outta here, huh.

30:48.672 --> 30:50.805
- Hey, shut your hole, Frank.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.949
- Oh my god, no.
What did they do?

31:03.992 --> 31:05.776
Are you okay, my darling?

31:05.820 --> 31:08.301
What have they done to you?

31:11.086 --> 31:13.567
- We didn't find nothin', boss.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.308
Except the stupid pets.

31:15.351 --> 31:17.440
-Oh, my darlings,
look at you.

31:17.484 --> 31:20.487
- Get over here.
Okay, Strick,

31:20.530 --> 31:22.532
I'm sick and tired
of your excuses.

31:22.576 --> 31:24.621
Where is it?

31:24.665 --> 31:26.232
- I told you, Boss.

31:26.275 --> 31:28.277
You're gonna have to wait
a little longer.

31:28.321 --> 31:29.800
- Listen here, Strick,

31:29.844 --> 31:31.193
you're the only one
in this god-forsaken place

31:31.237 --> 31:33.239
who can make opium
from that shit.

31:33.282 --> 31:35.937
Those animals in the yard
are gettin' twitchy.

31:35.981 --> 31:38.722
Makes me nervous
when they get twitchy.

31:38.766 --> 31:40.768
- We can't keep enough supply
on the shelves as it is,

31:40.811 --> 31:42.291
let alone do a cook.

31:42.335 --> 31:45.294
- I really don't give a shit.
- End of the week, Boss.

31:45.338 --> 31:47.993
Dr. Carnaby says he's getting
his shipment in tomorrow.

31:48.036 --> 31:50.560
He leaves early on Fridays.

31:50.604 --> 31:53.999
I'll start a cook
as soon as he does.

31:54.042 --> 31:58.177
- You better,
if you know what's good for you.

31:59.395 --> 32:02.529
Remember what happened
last time you were late?

32:02.572 --> 32:07.490
You piece of crap.
Get out of here, let's go.

32:20.895 --> 32:23.724
- Is everyone okay in here?

32:24.507 --> 32:26.683
Sorry for the upset.

32:27.989 --> 32:30.339
Yeah, hope they didn't
frighten you too much.

32:32.733 --> 32:35.518
Those boys have
no respect for nature.

32:45.137 --> 32:48.227
- Don't those things
creep you out, Elmer?

32:49.968 --> 32:52.971
- Spiders don't bite unless
they're threatened, Willis.

32:56.061 --> 32:58.106
Did you know, that there are
over 25 million tons

32:58.150 --> 33:00.456
of spiders in the world, Willis?

33:00.500 --> 33:03.285
- Yeah well, my old lady,
probably say that,

33:03.329 --> 33:06.201
at least a ton of them
in our barn.

33:07.507 --> 33:09.857
Always after me
to get the pest guy out.

33:09.900 --> 33:13.034
- Oh, you shouldn't do that,
Willis.

33:13.078 --> 33:16.298
Spiders are essential workers.

33:16.342 --> 33:19.867
They consume over 800 tons
of prey each year.

33:19.910 --> 33:23.175
They've survived
every extinction event

33:23.218 --> 33:25.742
since time began.

33:25.786 --> 33:28.702
And they're intelligent too,
did you know that?

33:28.745 --> 33:32.575
- Yeah well, never really
gave it much thought, Elmer.

33:32.619 --> 33:35.056
- This one's a lover,
not a fighter.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.753
Aint you, Min?

33:36.797 --> 33:40.583
I named him Min, after
the Egyptian god of fertility.

33:40.627 --> 33:43.891
They worshipped spiders,
the ancient Egyptians did.

33:43.934 --> 33:47.503
Believed they possessed
the means for eternal life.

33:48.939 --> 33:51.246
These are Min's harem.

33:51.290 --> 33:54.554
I call that one Grace,
because of her delicate web.

33:54.597 --> 33:57.122
This one next to her,
I call Azrael,

33:57.165 --> 33:59.298
after the Hebrew angel of death.

33:59.341 --> 34:01.822
And then there's Izunami,

34:01.865 --> 34:04.346
after the Japanese
goddess of the underworld.

34:04.390 --> 34:08.394
And Hecate, the goddess
of witchcraft and magic.

34:08.437 --> 34:10.091
- Are they poisonous?

34:10.135 --> 34:13.051
- Only if you're their prey.

34:15.140 --> 34:19.318
I've been collecting spiders
since I was a boy, Willis.

34:19.361 --> 34:23.713
They were the only friends
I had, growing up.

34:23.757 --> 34:26.716
I've always been
fascinated by them.

34:28.283 --> 34:29.937
I've written
several articles about them,

34:29.980 --> 34:32.940
for the arachnophile annual.

34:32.983 --> 34:35.029
I'm kind of a celebrity
in that world.

34:35.073 --> 34:38.815
I know everything,
about how they hunt,

34:38.859 --> 34:42.341
how they mate,
how they kill.

34:42.384 --> 34:44.430
Their venom contains
thousands of peptides

34:44.473 --> 34:47.215
that paralyze and disable
their prey.

34:47.259 --> 34:49.435
I was researching
a way to produce

34:49.478 --> 34:51.045
super concentrated venom,

34:51.089 --> 34:54.744
which I could synthesize
to relieve someone's pain.

34:56.268 --> 34:59.749
Unfortunately,
I ran out of time.

34:59.793 --> 35:03.057
- Well, I heard about
the parole hearin',

35:03.101 --> 35:07.888
I'm sorry, Elmer.
Listen, I'm not blind.

35:07.931 --> 35:09.107
Now, I know
you're not like

35:09.150 --> 35:10.760
the rest of the guys
in here, Elmer.

35:11.587 --> 35:15.243
Okay, life can be rough
for someone like you.

35:15.287 --> 35:18.768
- Let's just say,
I'm painfully aware, Willis.

35:18.812 --> 35:20.727
- You'd let me know,
if there was uh,

35:20.770 --> 35:23.730
if there was anything hinky
goin' on, right?

35:23.773 --> 35:26.254
- Of course.

35:26.950 --> 35:31.390
- All right, yep, I almost,
I almost forgot,

35:31.433 --> 35:34.132
mailroom said this
came for you today.

35:34.175 --> 35:37.265
- Mail?

35:40.790 --> 35:44.838
- Yeah,
watch your back, Elmer.

35:44.881 --> 35:48.624
- Eyes wide open, boss.

35:56.719 --> 35:58.634
-Dear Mr. Strick,

35:58.678 --> 36:01.333
I have admired your work
for some time.

36:01.376 --> 36:02.551
The ancients would have been

36:02.595 --> 36:04.988
most impressed
with your research.

36:05.032 --> 36:07.208
I found the enclosed
in an old library

36:07.252 --> 36:09.123
in Cairo, Egypt.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.952
I hope it's what
you've been looking for.

36:28.577 --> 36:31.754
- Open the road,
no, wait.

36:33.278 --> 36:36.498
Path, yes, path not road.

36:36.542 --> 36:39.371
Open the path,

36:40.720 --> 36:43.418
oh great majestic,

36:44.854 --> 36:49.424
with your wondrous...
Wondrous? No, no, no.

36:50.730 --> 36:53.820
Precious, yes precious,
not wondrous.

36:53.863 --> 36:57.867
With your precious nature.

36:59.260 --> 37:02.959
Goodness,
I've forgotten, haven't I.

37:03.003 --> 37:05.397
Apologies, my little friend.

37:07.137 --> 37:09.314
Don't slide on the parchment.

37:14.841 --> 37:17.322
Okay everyone,

37:17.365 --> 37:20.063
supper time, nice and fresh.

37:21.195 --> 37:24.285
Collected from the yard,
just this morning.

37:24.329 --> 37:26.069
There you are.

37:27.157 --> 37:30.422
Yes.
Ah, yes.

37:32.337 --> 37:34.077
For you, my friend.

37:47.265 --> 37:51.617
And for you, my darlin',
something special.

37:54.968 --> 37:57.492
In you go.

38:17.338 --> 38:19.906
- I've got it.

38:31.831 --> 38:35.791
- Sakhmet.
That's who you are.

38:35.835 --> 38:40.709
Sakhmet, mistress of dread,
she whom none can escape.

38:41.754 --> 38:43.973
That's your name.

38:46.367 --> 38:48.978
Come to me, oh great majestic,

38:49.022 --> 38:51.329
fill me with
your precious nature.

38:51.372 --> 38:52.808
Transform my soul.

38:55.158 --> 38:58.118
- Oh, it won't be long now.

39:08.694 --> 39:10.391
-We're sorry,
Mr. Strick,

39:10.435 --> 39:12.132
there's nothing we can do.

39:12.175 --> 39:15.222
The cancer has spread throughout
your mother's entire body.

39:16.092 --> 39:18.138
- Stopped on the way home
from work.

39:18.181 --> 39:22.708
Look, your favorites.
Gardenias, roses.

39:28.583 --> 39:31.847
You know how much I love you,
don't you, Mom?

39:31.891 --> 39:33.327
You're the smartest,

39:33.371 --> 39:35.851
most beautiful woman,
I've ever seen.

39:35.895 --> 39:38.637
You are, still.

39:39.725 --> 39:42.684
It's the light inside you, Mom.

39:43.511 --> 39:48.255
Your body's failed you,
but your spirit still shines.

39:51.737 --> 39:55.871
I'm gonna take away your pain.
Okay, Mom?

39:56.872 --> 40:01.703
I know it's uh,
how you want to go.

40:02.791 --> 40:04.880
It's time to end the suffering.

40:06.795 --> 40:11.191
I'm gonna set your spirit free.
Okay?

40:33.779 --> 40:36.085
-Hey Strick.

40:40.438 --> 40:43.266
- How did you get in here?

40:43.310 --> 40:45.573
- It's good to have friends
in high places.

40:45.617 --> 40:48.489
The dispensary got more supply
this morning.

40:48.533 --> 40:52.885
Your supervisor, Dr. Carnaby,
he told us himself.

40:53.842 --> 40:56.802
Bunk thinks you're playin' him.

40:56.845 --> 40:59.457
Do a little distributing
on your own, huh?

40:59.500 --> 41:01.284
Tryin' to make
a little side cash?

41:01.328 --> 41:05.071
- I told Officer Dill,
end of the week.

41:05.114 --> 41:06.942
You have to have patience.

41:08.509 --> 41:11.512
- I am so tired,

41:11.556 --> 41:13.558
of being fuckin' patient
with you.

41:15.342 --> 41:19.868
So, Dill sent me here
to give you a little incentive.

41:21.522 --> 41:23.263
Stay focused.

41:37.930 --> 41:39.758
- You got 24 hours.

41:53.380 --> 41:55.991
- You cryin'?

41:56.035 --> 41:58.167
They're just fuckin' bugs.
You shouldn't be allowed

41:58.211 --> 42:00.822
to have shit like that,
in here anyway.

42:01.997 --> 42:06.349
Bullet, hold him tight.
I'ma go do the rest of them.

42:13.748 --> 42:15.576
These things give me the creeps.

42:15.620 --> 42:17.839
They're all...

42:17.883 --> 42:20.233
fat and hairy.

42:22.627 --> 42:25.673
Jesus,
they stink.

42:26.979 --> 42:30.852
- Stop, don't!

42:34.552 --> 42:37.816
Fuck...

42:40.209 --> 42:42.298
Fuck, I think
it fucking blinded me.

42:42.342 --> 42:44.344
The damn thing blinded me.

42:45.693 --> 42:49.044
-Hey, what's goin on
over there?

42:58.227 --> 43:01.317
What in the glorious fuck
is going on here?

43:01.361 --> 43:03.885
One of his spiders bit me, boss.

43:03.929 --> 43:05.931
God damn thing grab me
right in the eye.

43:05.974 --> 43:08.760
I'm fuckin' blind, Strick.

43:08.803 --> 43:12.154
- He was gonna kill her,
she was just defending herself.

43:12.198 --> 43:14.461
He had no right.
- You got no right.

43:14.504 --> 43:16.724
You got no right to have
them god damn things in here.

43:16.768 --> 43:18.030
They're poisonous.

43:18.073 --> 43:19.684
- What in the hell
is goin' on in here?

43:19.727 --> 43:21.816
- One of Strick's
god damned spiders got loose.

43:21.860 --> 43:24.210
Bit Polish Frank in the eye
while he was sleepin'.

43:24.253 --> 43:25.472
I came upon the scene
and ordered Strick

43:25.515 --> 43:26.865
to tell me what happened.

43:26.908 --> 43:29.128
- That's a lie.
He tried to kill them all.

43:29.171 --> 43:32.522
For no reason.
They're just innocent spiders.

43:32.566 --> 43:36.004
They wouldn't hurt anyone.
- Oh yeah?

43:36.048 --> 43:39.312
Well, I'm here to tell ya.

43:39.355 --> 43:42.445
- This man needs to get
to the infirmary, right away.

43:43.664 --> 43:46.928
- Let's go.
Come on.

43:53.108 --> 43:56.459
Keep your fuckin' mouth shut
or I'll blind the other eye.

43:56.503 --> 43:59.114
That goes for you too, asshole.

43:59.158 --> 44:02.988
- Fuck off.

44:03.031 --> 44:05.251
- Everybody, shut the fuck up.

44:24.966 --> 44:29.449
- You didn't die in vain, Min.

44:30.058 --> 44:31.712
They'll find out.

44:35.629 --> 44:37.544
They'll find out.

44:44.464 --> 44:48.207
- You wanna tell me what really
just went down in here, Elmer?

44:48.250 --> 44:51.558
- I told you, boss.

44:51.601 --> 44:55.431
Bullet and Polish Frank,
wanted to kill my spiders.

44:57.607 --> 44:59.522
I tried to fight them off.

45:01.916 --> 45:06.007
- Okay, come on, let's go
get that finger bandaged up.

45:19.281 --> 45:21.414
- I'm sorry to have to say it,

45:21.457 --> 45:24.852
but I think we've indulged
your hobby long enough, Elmer.

45:24.896 --> 45:28.160
I'm convinced
after last night's episode,

45:28.203 --> 45:31.641
morale has been,
adversely affected.

45:31.685 --> 45:33.643
I have no choice.

45:33.687 --> 45:36.168
Tomorrow, first thing,

45:36.211 --> 45:39.519
cell block C is to be evacuated
until the pest control company

45:39.562 --> 45:42.130
can complete
their fumigation services.

45:42.174 --> 45:44.089
Move the inmates
to A and D block,

45:44.132 --> 45:45.917
where they can
double and triple up if need be,

45:45.960 --> 45:51.052
until I deem it safe to return.
Is that understood?

45:51.096 --> 45:52.750
- Sir, A and D block

45:52.793 --> 45:55.143
are dangerously overcrowded
as it is.

45:55.187 --> 45:56.449
- Would you prefer

45:56.492 --> 45:59.104
poisonous spiders
roamin' C block instead?

45:59.147 --> 46:01.715
Officer Willis?

46:04.805 --> 46:07.068
I'm sorry Elmer.

46:10.811 --> 46:12.378
- If there's anything left,
after they get done

46:12.421 --> 46:14.075
gassin' the joint,
I'll make you

46:14.119 --> 46:16.643
get down on your knees
and eat what's left.

46:16.686 --> 46:18.776
Spider boy.

46:30.309 --> 46:32.137
- Is everyone all right
in there?

46:34.182 --> 46:38.491
Look, we don't have much time,
they're coming for you tomorrow.

46:38.534 --> 46:40.885
I won't let them hurt you,
I promise.

46:40.928 --> 46:43.278
But we're gonna
have to act fast.

47:22.927 --> 47:27.888
Come to me, oh great majestic.

47:27.932 --> 47:30.499
Fill me
with your precious nature.

47:30.543 --> 47:33.589
Transform my soul.

47:33.633 --> 47:36.418
Open the path
to my resurrection.

47:36.462 --> 47:39.378
Open the path
to my perfection.

47:39.421 --> 47:42.424
Hail to thee, oh great majestic.

47:42.468 --> 47:46.472
Come to me and consume my soul.

48:23.335 --> 48:26.077
- Hail to thee, oh great
majestic.

48:26.120 --> 48:29.819
Come to me and consume my soul.

48:35.564 --> 48:39.264
Hail to thee, oh great majestic.

48:39.307 --> 48:41.266
Come to me

48:41.309 --> 48:44.356
and consume my soul.

49:10.948 --> 49:13.037
Aah-

49:21.871 --> 49:24.874
- Strick, you little shit.

49:24.918 --> 49:27.312
It's just you and me, now.

49:27.355 --> 49:30.619
I'm gonna remind you
who runs the show around here.

49:30.663 --> 49:33.144
And you're gonna get down
on those boney knees of yours

49:33.187 --> 49:35.624
and let me do it
for as long as I want.

49:48.898 --> 49:50.639
What in the shit?

49:53.468 --> 49:55.514
Where the hell is he?

49:57.516 --> 50:00.214
What the...

50:02.173 --> 50:04.740
Are you frigging kiddin' me?
Shit.

50:20.539 --> 50:22.236
- What's goin' on?

50:36.772 --> 50:40.124
- Oh my.
Oh, my god.

50:40.167 --> 50:42.343
No! No!

50:43.736 --> 50:47.522
No, get back!
Stop! Stop!

50:47.566 --> 50:51.091
I don't want it, no Ma, Ma,
don't do it.

50:51.135 --> 50:54.312
Leave me alone!

50:54.355 --> 50:56.401
- Oh my god,
oh my god.

51:22.775 --> 51:25.865
- Look like something literally,
sucked his insides out.

51:29.260 --> 51:30.565
- Where's Elmer?

51:30.609 --> 51:32.393
- No sign of him.
