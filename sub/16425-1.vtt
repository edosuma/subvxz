01:42.167 --> 01:44.042
Hey, get out of the car, kid.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.708
Get out of the car.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.583
Hey, kid. Get out of the car. Come on.

01:52.875 --> 01:54.000
Hey, moron.

01:54.125 --> 01:55.833
Get him out of the car, would you?

02:01.708 --> 02:04.125
Come on, dude. Get out of the car.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.583
Come on. Open it.

02:07.667 --> 02:08.792
Come on. Get out of the car.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.375
Get out of the fucking car.

02:11.500 --> 02:12.917
Fuck!

02:13.000 --> 02:15.500
Put down the fucking window! l'm serious!

02:30.708 --> 02:32.750
Why'd you have to sell the car?

02:34.750 --> 02:37.000
lt couldn't stay out
in front of the house forever, T.J.

02:37.167 --> 02:38.333
Why not?

02:41.750 --> 02:42.833
lt's not healthy.

02:42.958 --> 02:44.583
Neither are these.

02:49.417 --> 02:51.042
l don't want to talk about it anymore.

03:08.833 --> 03:10.125
Hey.

03:14.833 --> 03:16.042
Morning.

03:17.708 --> 03:20.125
Can l have some money
so l can buy lunch today?

03:25.292 --> 03:27.167
Yeah. Sorry.

03:34.167 --> 03:35.417
Thanks.

03:35.833 --> 03:37.583
Have a nice day, Teej.

04:40.750 --> 04:42.167
Come on. Get up.

04:47.833 --> 04:48.958
Please.

04:54.833 --> 04:55.958
You just fucked me.

05:03.458 --> 05:04.625
Who's in there?

05:10.417 --> 05:11.833
Motherfuck!

05:22.625 --> 05:23.667
Hey!

06:00.708 --> 06:02.208
Cole.

06:02.583 --> 06:03.917
Dimino.

06:04.042 --> 06:05.208
Hooper.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.250
Fullwood.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.208
Edgerdon.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.250
Fletcher.

06:12.083 --> 06:13.833
Forney. T.J. Forney's back?

06:14.875 --> 06:15.958
Welcome back, T.J.

06:17.458 --> 06:18.583
Roger.

06:19.292 --> 06:20.458
Sumner.

06:20.875 --> 06:21.917
Sarasota...

06:43.042 --> 06:46.625
What's up now, punk?
You don't look so tough, now, do you?

06:47.000 --> 06:49.375
-Leave me alone.
-How about you suck my cock?

06:50.250 --> 06:51.708
Suck my cock.

06:52.167 --> 06:54.000
Fucking suck my cock.

07:27.417 --> 07:28.792
Hi, pumpkin.

07:29.250 --> 07:30.875
-Hi.
-How was your day?

07:32.167 --> 07:34.000
lt pretty much sucked.

07:34.208 --> 07:35.667
Why, sweetheart?

07:36.500 --> 07:37.833
l don't know. Just did.

07:41.042 --> 07:42.333
You want me to turn on the light for you?

07:43.708 --> 07:46.250
Why, do l look like l'm sitting
in the dark here?

07:48.250 --> 07:50.167
l don't know. Maybe a little.

07:51.250 --> 07:53.208
Maybe l need new glasses.

07:55.542 --> 07:58.167
Actually, l don't even know
if these are mine.

07:58.292 --> 07:59.792
Whose are they?

08:00.333 --> 08:02.042
Geez, l don't know.

08:04.833 --> 08:06.667
Well, can you see better with them?

08:08.750 --> 08:11.000
Just... l don't know.

08:15.125 --> 08:16.792
ls your dad up yet?

08:18.167 --> 08:20.375
Why, has he been sleeping all day?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.833
You know, sometimes people
get thrown off balance

08:25.958 --> 08:27.458
when bad things happen.

08:27.583 --> 08:30.083
But they come good again, in the end.

08:45.875 --> 08:47.750
Milk to wet your whistle?

08:47.833 --> 08:48.917
Yeah.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.000
Okay.

09:04.333 --> 09:06.042
How does that feel?

09:06.667 --> 09:09.417
Here. You want to turn
your wrist for me a little bit, like this.

09:09.500 --> 09:11.208
And now, like this.

09:11.875 --> 09:13.000
Good.

09:13.125 --> 09:17.000
lf we consider that dreams
serve a metaphoric function

09:17.083 --> 09:19.750
in narrative fiction, as they do in life,

09:19.833 --> 09:23.500
what metaphoric function
are these dreams serving

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
for our protagonist?

09:25.125 --> 09:28.625
Are they premonitions, or are they desires?

09:29.500 --> 09:30.542
Are they nightmares, even?

09:32.000 --> 09:34.292
Given what we know about Maurice,

09:34.375 --> 09:37.292
where he's from,
what his childhood was like...

09:37.833 --> 09:39.792
l think it's a safe assumption to assume

09:39.875 --> 09:42.875
the dreams he's having are a reflection

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
upon his relationship to his mother.

09:46.167 --> 09:48.000
T.J.! What are you doing?

09:49.500 --> 09:51.000
Bring that here.

09:59.125 --> 10:00.625
Hey, fuckface!

10:00.958 --> 10:02.542
You think this is funny?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.208
Fuckface!

10:04.708 --> 10:06.167
You think this is funny?

10:06.542 --> 10:08.958
l'm going to fucking rip your head off!

10:41.333 --> 10:43.250
l'm going to fucking kill you!

10:43.833 --> 10:45.792
You think you can draw on my fucking car?

10:45.875 --> 10:46.833
Hey!

10:46.958 --> 10:48.375
-Get off him!
-Get the fuck up, bitch!

10:48.500 --> 10:49.667
Stop it!

10:49.833 --> 10:51.167
Get the fuck up, bitch!

10:51.292 --> 10:53.000
-l said stop it!
-Get the fuck up!

10:54.500 --> 10:56.667
What the fuck are you doing, lady?

10:56.792 --> 10:58.458
What are you doing?

10:59.667 --> 11:00.667
Hey!

11:00.917 --> 11:02.750
Hey. Hey.

11:03.833 --> 11:05.583
We're not finished, you little piece of shit.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.792
You okay?

11:20.375 --> 11:21.625
Am l bleeding?

11:22.875 --> 11:24.458
l don't think so.

11:25.583 --> 11:26.625
Am l?

11:32.792 --> 11:33.917
Oh.

11:34.292 --> 11:35.667
Need a ride?

11:36.083 --> 11:38.292
Come on. Come on.

11:48.292 --> 11:50.167
l can't believe he called me lady.

11:50.292 --> 11:52.417
Do l look like a lady to you?

11:55.833 --> 11:57.000
l guess.

12:03.833 --> 12:04.958
Thanks.

12:05.833 --> 12:07.792
l was asking if l look old.

12:12.542 --> 12:13.625
So...

12:14.292 --> 12:16.667
Guess l'm kind of a hero now, huh?

12:20.458 --> 12:23.083
Well, actually, l basically just
didn't want to have to go home

12:23.167 --> 12:26.292
and then feel bad the rest of the day
for not helping you,

12:26.625 --> 12:29.708
then hear about you on the news
getting beat to death in the parking lot.

12:30.333 --> 12:33.333
So l really just did it for myself
'cause l'm selfish.

12:35.333 --> 12:36.458
Sorry.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.333
Sorry l'm like that.

12:52.708 --> 12:53.875
Okay.

13:02.542 --> 13:03.750
See you.

13:15.833 --> 13:17.167
Hey!

13:18.125 --> 13:19.167
You want your bike?

13:20.542 --> 13:21.625
Shit.

13:38.042 --> 13:39.458
Nice meeting you.

13:45.750 --> 13:46.792
Dad?

13:53.458 --> 13:54.458
Dad?

13:58.208 --> 13:59.250
Dad?

14:01.208 --> 14:02.500
Grandma, where's Dad?

14:02.625 --> 14:04.000
Oh, hi, T.J.

14:04.167 --> 14:06.000
He's gone to the doctor, honey.

14:06.083 --> 14:07.125
Everything okay?

14:07.250 --> 14:08.667
Yeah, okay.

14:19.333 --> 14:21.333
Where's the laundry room?

14:22.083 --> 14:23.167
My dad's going to be home soon...

14:23.292 --> 14:25.250
Where's the laundry room?

14:25.500 --> 14:26.500
Why?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.833
Ever been skull-fucked?

14:30.917 --> 14:31.917
No.

14:32.167 --> 14:33.917
Would you like to be?

14:34.958 --> 14:36.667
lt's through there.

14:36.833 --> 14:38.833
But why? You can't.

14:57.542 --> 14:59.250
What are you doing?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.708
What are you doing?

15:04.250 --> 15:05.667
Why are you here?

15:11.250 --> 15:14.292
You're going to start acting
like l belong here,

15:14.417 --> 15:16.000
or l'll kill you.

15:17.042 --> 15:18.875
l'll kill your family.

15:53.167 --> 15:54.292
You can't smoke in here.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.875
What are you doing?
You can't smoke in here.

16:04.333 --> 16:05.792
Will you please just put it out?

16:07.500 --> 16:09.042
How about l put it out in your mouth?

16:22.083 --> 16:23.625
T.J., who is this?

16:24.542 --> 16:25.833
My name's Hesher.

16:25.958 --> 16:28.000
l'm a friend of your son's.

16:30.750 --> 16:32.042
What is he doing here?

16:33.167 --> 16:35.375
He's... He's doing laundry.

16:37.833 --> 16:40.042
Can l talk to you for a second?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.167
ls he smoking in the house?

16:51.292 --> 16:52.542
Oh, well, l...

16:59.583 --> 17:00.667
He's a friend of yours?

17:00.792 --> 17:01.792
l told him he could sleep on the couch.

17:01.917 --> 17:04.583
You guys know you only got four channels?

17:16.958 --> 17:18.833
Hello, there, young man.

17:19.166 --> 17:20.250
Hey, old lady.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.291
Can l help you with something?

17:26.000 --> 17:27.458
No, l'm good.

17:55.625 --> 17:56.917
Fuck!

17:57.792 --> 17:59.417
God damn it!

18:06.542 --> 18:08.333
Jesus fucking Christ.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.625
Now you got more channels.

19:03.583 --> 19:04.708
So, why are you here?

19:04.833 --> 19:05.875
What?

19:08.625 --> 19:09.750
That your room?

19:09.875 --> 19:11.708
No, that's the garage.

19:22.792 --> 19:25.250
Would your friend like to eat
some dinner, dear?

19:25.917 --> 19:27.417
He's not hungry.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.750
You sure?

19:30.083 --> 19:31.583
Yeah, l'm sure.

19:32.208 --> 19:34.167
What's he doing in the garage?

19:34.250 --> 19:35.417
l don't know.

19:35.500 --> 19:38.083
l told him he could practice
his guitar in there.

19:38.167 --> 19:40.042
Oh, that's great, honey.

19:40.875 --> 19:44.250
So nice to have a bit of music
around the house again.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.667
ls he a new friend?

19:47.833 --> 19:49.875
Yeah. Sort of.

19:52.250 --> 19:56.333
You know, your grandfather
played the harmonica for many years.

20:30.917 --> 20:33.583
Oh, l'm sorry, honey. We're out of milk.

20:33.750 --> 20:36.500
l can cook you up some eggs
if you like, dear.

20:36.667 --> 20:37.625
No, thanks.

20:39.333 --> 20:40.708
Would you like to take a walk?

20:40.833 --> 20:43.500
l can't, Grandma. l got stuff l got to do.

20:44.042 --> 20:46.792
No, l mean later. This afternoon.

20:47.833 --> 20:50.167
l don't know.
Can you ask me when l get home?

20:50.500 --> 20:51.833
All righty.

21:31.375 --> 21:32.625
l want to get the car back.

21:33.833 --> 21:35.708
The car is not for sale.

21:35.833 --> 21:36.958
Well, l want to buy it back.

21:37.083 --> 21:38.125
So how much do you want for it?

21:40.208 --> 21:41.458
Sit down.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.417
$1,800 for the car,

21:46.500 --> 21:48.250
not including taxes, registration,

21:48.333 --> 21:49.333
-ADM or dealer fees...
-Yeah, l can get that.

21:49.458 --> 21:50.958
On top of that,

21:51.042 --> 21:52.500
you also need a valid driver's license.

21:52.583 --> 21:54.083
l'm sure you don't have one of those.

21:54.208 --> 21:56.667
-You need proof of insurance.
-But l can get...

21:56.750 --> 21:58.458
And l know you don't have that.

21:58.542 --> 22:00.667
And even if you did have
both of these things,

22:00.792 --> 22:01.792
l couldn't sell you the car

22:01.917 --> 22:05.250
because the damn thing's not for sale.
End of story.

22:05.333 --> 22:07.125
Now, if you'll let me get back to this.

22:50.917 --> 22:52.000
Hi.

22:52.667 --> 22:53.667
Hey.

22:54.458 --> 22:55.958
How's it going?

22:56.958 --> 22:58.667
l got you an ice cream.

22:59.625 --> 23:01.625
That's so nice. Thank you.

23:04.833 --> 23:06.458
And l paid for it over there.

23:08.208 --> 23:09.500
Thank you.

23:16.833 --> 23:18.208
See you.

23:18.875 --> 23:20.083
See you.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.292
And earlier that day,

23:29.375 --> 23:31.625
l had made a cherry cake.

23:32.167 --> 23:34.292
And l used... l didn't know until afterwards,

23:34.375 --> 23:37.333
l used a new product. lt was called Fluffo.

23:38.333 --> 23:40.208
l never made it again, that Fluffo.

23:40.333 --> 23:42.542
l served the cake, and then...

23:44.833 --> 23:47.875
lt stuck to the roof of their mouth.

23:49.125 --> 23:50.333
They couldn't swallow it!

23:52.375 --> 23:54.292
Fucking Fluffo.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.042
Oh, hi, T.J.

23:57.833 --> 23:59.125
Hi, honey.

24:11.792 --> 24:15.083
So, who's going for a walk with me
tomorrow morning?

24:20.042 --> 24:21.125
T.J.?

24:21.708 --> 24:24.250
l can't, Grandma.
l have to go to school tomorrow.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.958
Oh. Okay. Okay.

24:28.167 --> 24:30.000
You're always invited.

24:31.958 --> 24:32.958
So what?

24:37.333 --> 24:38.917
So what, school?

24:39.667 --> 24:41.000
Go on a walk with your grandma.

24:41.125 --> 24:42.708
He's right, T.J.

24:42.833 --> 24:43.958
l'd love the company.

24:44.083 --> 24:45.667
Fucking A, she would.

24:45.792 --> 24:48.333
Your grandma goes walking
in the morning by herself.

24:49.500 --> 24:51.917
You can't get your ass
out of bed an hour earlier?

24:53.000 --> 24:54.125
What if she gets raped?

24:55.708 --> 24:56.917
What?

24:57.000 --> 24:58.458
Ever heard of the Granny Killer?

24:58.875 --> 25:00.708
-The Granny Killer?
-Yeah, the Granny...

25:01.667 --> 25:03.833
The Granny Killer killed, like,
13 or 1 4 old ladies.

25:04.583 --> 25:06.167
Used to choke them
with their dirty panties and shit.

25:06.292 --> 25:07.500
l don't think he'd cock-fuck 'em all,

25:07.625 --> 25:09.792
-but he would finger-fuck 'em all.
-Okay. That's enough.

25:12.625 --> 25:14.792
l don't care. l'm just saying.

25:16.500 --> 25:19.542
Your grandma asked you to go for a walk.
You should go.

25:20.583 --> 25:22.500
So she doesn't get raped.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.708
Why would anyone rape me?

25:25.625 --> 25:27.125
Fucked if l know.

25:27.667 --> 25:29.083
People do it.

25:29.500 --> 25:31.333
There's some sick fucks out there.

26:27.875 --> 26:31.667
You fucked my car, you little prick.

26:32.250 --> 26:34.750
Get in there. Eat the cake!

26:34.833 --> 26:36.250
Fucking eat the fucking cake!

26:38.750 --> 26:40.167
Get off me!

26:40.292 --> 26:41.583
Get off me!

26:42.583 --> 26:43.875
Get off!

26:48.958 --> 26:50.458
Eat the cake, you bitch!

26:54.833 --> 26:55.833
Ready?

27:00.083 --> 27:01.167
l don't want to go.

27:02.625 --> 27:04.125
lt will be good for us.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.625
Come on. Teej, we're going to be late.

27:14.625 --> 27:18.000
So, welcome everyone
to the transformational grief group.

27:18.542 --> 27:20.125
My name is Meryl.

27:21.333 --> 27:23.833
We should start off by introducing ourselves

27:23.958 --> 27:26.750
and briefly explaining why we are here.

27:33.583 --> 27:35.375
Hi. Would you please start us off?

27:38.792 --> 27:41.542
We're the Bolder Family.

27:43.583 --> 27:46.875
l'm Coleen. This is my husband Jack.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.667
Our daughter Cynthia...

27:53.667 --> 27:56.000
Was murdered last year.

27:59.625 --> 28:01.167
She's the victim

28:03.667 --> 28:07.792
of a violent attack that was unfair and sick.

28:13.542 --> 28:15.792
We're here 'cause we need help.

28:17.292 --> 28:18.875
We lost our baby.

28:28.750 --> 28:30.458
Hi. My name is Jack.

28:33.292 --> 28:39.042
As my wife said, we're here hoping
for some answers, and...

28:41.583 --> 28:44.583
Just some help with the pain.

28:45.917 --> 28:47.208
Thank you.

28:49.417 --> 28:52.083
Coleen and Jack, welcome.

28:53.625 --> 28:54.625
Sir?

29:03.208 --> 29:04.833
Sure, okay.

29:07.958 --> 29:10.125
My name is Paul Forney,

29:10.500 --> 29:13.292
and this is my son T.J.

29:16.375 --> 29:20.000
And we're here because l lost my wife,

29:21.042 --> 29:22.375
T.J.'s mom,

29:23.875 --> 29:26.125
a bit more than two months ago.

29:30.542 --> 29:32.000
We're just

29:33.000 --> 29:35.125
trying to come to terms with things.

29:37.083 --> 29:40.292
And looking

29:42.708 --> 29:44.333
for guidance around...

29:50.500 --> 29:54.792
...things. So, yeah.

30:02.208 --> 30:04.667
Okay. Welcome, Paul.

30:08.167 --> 30:09.333
Hi, T.J.

30:12.292 --> 30:15.000
l understand how hard it is to lose a mom.

30:17.708 --> 30:20.125
Would you like to introduce yourself,

30:20.208 --> 30:21.417
say a few words to the group?

30:49.083 --> 30:50.292
What the fuck's your problem?

30:53.333 --> 30:55.083
What the fuck's wrong with you?

30:55.500 --> 30:56.583
What's wrong with you?

30:56.667 --> 30:59.000
You let that fucking asshole
stick my head in the toilet.

30:59.125 --> 31:01.792
You just stand there and watch him do it.

31:03.500 --> 31:04.708
Get out.

31:04.833 --> 31:06.167
Get out of my grandma's house!

31:06.708 --> 31:07.917
Get out.

31:08.833 --> 31:10.542
Get the fuck off me.

31:21.125 --> 31:22.458
l'm going to put some clothes on.

31:23.417 --> 31:25.875
You meet me outside in my van, all right?

31:38.500 --> 31:40.333
Where are we going?

31:41.167 --> 31:42.875
Where are we going?

32:09.333 --> 32:10.708
What are we doing here?

32:12.000 --> 32:13.833
Let's get out of here.

32:14.875 --> 32:16.250
Come on.

32:19.667 --> 32:20.625
What are you doing?

32:31.167 --> 32:33.625
What are we doing here?

32:34.500 --> 32:36.167
What are you doing?

32:36.667 --> 32:38.500
Let's get out of here.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.042
Shit.

32:43.875 --> 32:46.292
Come on, man. Let's just get out of here.

32:46.375 --> 32:48.417
Please. What are you doing?

32:50.042 --> 32:51.792
What is that? What...

32:51.917 --> 32:52.958
Stop.

32:56.625 --> 32:58.042
Stop. You can't do...

33:00.333 --> 33:02.125
You got gas on my head.

33:20.542 --> 33:22.833
Come on. Let's go.

33:23.958 --> 33:25.042
Stop.

33:29.417 --> 33:30.833
Just go home.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.042
Shit. No. No, no, no.

33:39.708 --> 33:41.292
This isn't funny. Come on.

33:42.500 --> 33:44.083
Come on. Just go.

33:44.167 --> 33:46.625
Come on, man. Just get out of here.

33:46.708 --> 33:48.333
Please, no. Stop.

33:48.458 --> 33:49.875
No, no, no.

33:50.667 --> 33:52.667
What the hell's your problem!

33:53.708 --> 33:54.667
Come on! Let's go, quick!

33:56.667 --> 33:58.667
Come on! Let's go! Hurry up!

33:59.917 --> 34:01.250
Come on!

34:04.667 --> 34:07.292
Shit. The car's locked. Open it up!

34:07.750 --> 34:09.292
Open the door. lt's locked.

34:10.500 --> 34:12.000
Open the door!

34:12.625 --> 34:13.792
Open the door!

34:13.875 --> 34:14.958
Shit!

34:15.625 --> 34:16.917
What the fuck?

34:17.000 --> 34:18.417
Hey! Hey!

34:50.708 --> 34:51.792
Get in the van.

34:51.917 --> 34:52.958
No.

34:53.042 --> 34:54.417
Get in the fucking van, now.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.125
l'm going to run you over.

35:18.833 --> 35:19.875
Dude?

35:28.375 --> 35:30.417
Dude, that was fucking awesome.

35:33.208 --> 35:35.500
You flew, like, fucking five feet.

35:36.917 --> 35:37.917
Oh!

35:54.500 --> 35:55.958
Okay.

35:56.708 --> 35:57.958
Let's go.

36:00.708 --> 36:02.292
Fuck.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.167
Come on.

36:39.208 --> 36:42.208
Hello, ma'am. l'm Officer Haywood.
This is Officer Jordan.

36:42.750 --> 36:45.167
We need to speak to Thomas Forney.

36:46.667 --> 36:48.625
-Tommy?
-Thomas Forney.

36:49.083 --> 36:50.417
ls he here?

36:51.000 --> 36:52.833
Are you Thomas Forney?

36:55.750 --> 36:56.958
Yeah.

36:58.208 --> 36:59.917
We'd like to ask you some questions.

37:00.125 --> 37:02.000
lt's just some questions, dude.

37:02.083 --> 37:03.125
What about?

37:03.208 --> 37:05.333
Can you get dressed, please?

37:18.208 --> 37:19.667
Let this be a warning to you.

37:19.792 --> 37:22.042
Regardless of what evidence
we find or don't,

37:22.167 --> 37:24.208
you've come to our attention today.

37:25.417 --> 37:26.625
Turn left.

37:26.750 --> 37:28.083
Our attention's not good.

37:29.208 --> 37:31.000
These are felony offenses.

37:31.125 --> 37:33.167
Serious jail time offenses.

37:38.333 --> 37:39.833
Did you do it?

37:42.458 --> 37:43.792
Not really.

37:44.208 --> 37:45.583
Not really?

37:45.875 --> 37:47.375
l didn't do it.

37:50.167 --> 37:51.583
You just said not really.

37:52.625 --> 37:53.875
What does that mean, ''not really''?

37:54.375 --> 37:55.458
l said l didn't do it, okay?

37:55.667 --> 37:57.375
Okay. Before that, l asked you if you did it,

37:57.500 --> 37:59.458
and you said ''not really.''

38:00.583 --> 38:02.125
l can't remember what l said.

38:05.125 --> 38:06.958
Why would you do something like that?

38:18.208 --> 38:19.292
Want a peanut?

38:19.417 --> 38:20.417
No.

38:28.458 --> 38:30.292
So, what'd the pigs want?

38:31.333 --> 38:33.208
What the fuck do you think?

38:33.333 --> 38:34.708
l don't know.

38:34.833 --> 38:36.125
They give you a cavity search?

38:36.833 --> 38:38.542
Just fuck off, okay?

38:38.667 --> 38:40.417
What? What'd they do?

38:40.542 --> 38:42.042
They took my fucking fingerprints.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.125
Yeah, so?

38:46.083 --> 38:47.792
Just leave me alone.

38:50.958 --> 38:53.708
All right, l'll go. But on one condition.

39:53.417 --> 39:55.583
Do you think she shaves her pussy?

39:56.333 --> 39:57.292
What are you doing here?

39:57.375 --> 39:59.542
What are you doing here, dude?
You're not shopping.

39:59.667 --> 40:00.792
You're stalking that chick.

40:01.083 --> 40:02.500
-No, l'm not.
-Yeah, you are.

40:02.625 --> 40:03.583
l've been following you.

40:03.667 --> 40:04.875
You going to try and fuck her?

40:05.000 --> 40:07.042
-No.
-Well, that's good.

40:07.792 --> 40:10.667
You can't fuck her from here, dude.
Got to be way closer.

40:11.458 --> 40:12.833
What?

40:13.458 --> 40:14.500
Hey, you want to poke her?

40:14.625 --> 40:15.792
Shut up.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.250
Dude, there's nothing wrong
with wanting to poke her.

40:18.333 --> 40:19.958
Stop saying that.

40:20.042 --> 40:21.875
Dude, if you want to poke her,

40:22.000 --> 40:23.750
there's nothing wrong with that.
Don't be ashamed.

40:23.833 --> 40:26.542
Human beings have been poking vagina
for hundreds of years.

40:26.667 --> 40:28.250
Longer, probably.

40:28.500 --> 40:29.500
Bro.

40:30.250 --> 40:32.250
Seriously, there's nothing
wrong with wanting some pussy.

40:43.792 --> 40:45.375
Where you going?

40:45.917 --> 40:47.042
Home.

40:47.167 --> 40:48.958
l'll give you a ride.

40:49.042 --> 40:50.375
No, thanks.

40:52.583 --> 40:53.625
Well, all right.

40:53.708 --> 40:55.542
But if you go with me,
it will take you five minutes.

40:55.667 --> 40:57.708
Ride the bike, it's like, what, 15?

41:02.500 --> 41:03.667
Fine.

41:04.583 --> 41:05.833
But don't talk to me, okay?

41:06.292 --> 41:07.625
l won't say shit.

41:17.625 --> 41:19.000
Listen, man.

41:20.292 --> 41:21.458
l'm sorry about the fire the other night.

41:21.542 --> 41:23.042
That was...

41:24.333 --> 41:26.917
That was totally out of control, and...

41:27.042 --> 41:29.708
lt was foolish and irresponsible, really.

41:30.042 --> 41:32.292
So, l'm sorry.

41:33.042 --> 41:34.125
But, here.

41:35.500 --> 41:37.000
l want you to have this.

41:37.083 --> 41:38.500
Get that away from me.

41:40.583 --> 41:43.125
Dude, are you gay? l don't...

41:44.250 --> 41:45.625
Well, l can't work you out.

41:48.500 --> 41:49.792
Oh, shit.

41:59.792 --> 42:00.875
What are you doing?

42:05.208 --> 42:06.833
Stop the car. l want to get out.
Stop the car...

42:06.958 --> 42:09.292
Get out of this van, and l will rip
your dick off and fuck her for you.

42:52.875 --> 42:53.958
Whoops.

42:55.708 --> 42:57.000
That's fucked up.

42:58.833 --> 43:00.792
Sorry. l'm so sorry. l don't know...

43:00.875 --> 43:02.875
Just messed up the back of my car,

43:03.000 --> 43:04.667
you stupid idiot.

43:05.417 --> 43:06.750
Oh, my God.

43:06.833 --> 43:08.708
You're a fucking idiot.

43:09.583 --> 43:11.042
Lady, you're an absolute idiot.

43:11.292 --> 43:12.917
What is the matter with you?

43:13.292 --> 43:15.042
l don't know what happened, sir.

43:15.167 --> 43:18.333
You need to pay attention
when you are driving a fucking car.

43:19.167 --> 43:20.625
Yeah, l think l can be of some help here.

43:20.833 --> 43:22.875
l saw the whole thing.

43:23.250 --> 43:24.875
She was just sitting there.
You backed right into her.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.125
l what?

43:26.333 --> 43:27.375
l don't know what's wrong with you, man.

43:27.500 --> 43:29.708
Why would you back into a car?
lt's fucking retarded.

43:29.833 --> 43:31.458
l don't know what you're talking about.

43:32.417 --> 43:34.542
You should probably start talking
about paying for her damages.

43:34.667 --> 43:36.583
-Look at this shit.
-l did not back into her.

43:40.250 --> 43:41.792
Calling me a fucking liar?

43:41.875 --> 43:44.208
Look, l don't... What is going on here?

43:48.000 --> 43:49.708
l don't know.
Sounds like you're calling me a fucking liar.

43:49.833 --> 43:50.958
No...

43:53.542 --> 43:54.583
Okay. All right. All right.

43:54.667 --> 43:55.792
l don't want any trouble here.

43:55.917 --> 43:57.375
-You don't want any trouble?
-No.

43:57.958 --> 43:59.958
l think you do, Miss Piggy.

44:03.333 --> 44:05.083
This is ridiculous.

44:37.333 --> 44:40.000
Come on, dude. Let's just get out of here.

44:40.792 --> 44:43.125
Dude, your sexy girlfriend's in trouble.

44:43.208 --> 44:44.167
We're not going anywhere.

45:05.667 --> 45:07.083
You guys know each other?

45:10.875 --> 45:11.958
Hi.

45:21.583 --> 45:24.250
Sometimes, you know, a day is bad,

45:24.875 --> 45:26.958
and you think it couldn't get any worse,

45:27.083 --> 45:28.917
and then, suddenly you discover

45:29.000 --> 45:30.792
whole new ways it can get worse.

45:35.958 --> 45:37.250
No, thanks.

45:39.875 --> 45:41.000
Get that away from me.

45:43.375 --> 45:45.333
This one time, a couple of years back,

45:45.417 --> 45:47.125
l had these four chicks
in the back of the van,

45:47.208 --> 45:50.292
and we're all, like, super fucking wasted
and going for it, right?

45:50.417 --> 45:51.833
So l was eating this one chick out,

45:52.167 --> 45:53.667
l was fingering another chick,

45:54.167 --> 45:56.292
but there's still two chicks, right,
and they want to get off.

45:56.417 --> 45:58.167
So l got my other hand
fingering this other chick,

45:58.292 --> 46:00.458
and l got my toe rubbing on
the fourth chick's asshole

46:00.542 --> 46:01.500
and l was going crazy, man.

46:01.667 --> 46:02.625
lt was like, ''This is too much.''

46:02.750 --> 46:05.583
You know, l was like,
couldn't tell which chick was which.

46:05.667 --> 46:08.292
Tongue started to hurt.
Fingers getting tired.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.458
l stepped back.

46:13.500 --> 46:15.667
You know what happened?

46:17.458 --> 46:18.958
These chicks just start
working on each other.

46:19.667 --> 46:21.792
They're fingering each other,
eating each other out.

46:22.333 --> 46:23.958
l just sat back and watched the whole thing.

46:24.583 --> 46:26.708
l just whipped my cock out,
jerked myself off.

46:27.125 --> 46:28.833
Everyone's a winner.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.917
Was that some kind of
perverted metaphor for me?

46:36.583 --> 46:37.958
A what?

46:38.500 --> 46:39.958
Never mind.

46:52.333 --> 46:54.125
Whoa! Stop!

46:55.000 --> 46:57.042
l mean it! What are you doing?

46:59.333 --> 47:01.292
You're going to kill us!

47:01.583 --> 47:03.917
Please, stop! Are you fucking crazy?

47:13.083 --> 47:14.667
The fuck was that?

47:15.208 --> 47:16.458
l saw a mouse.

47:16.583 --> 47:18.917
What? You okay?

47:20.625 --> 47:22.375
l think l have dirt in my mouth.

47:25.583 --> 47:26.625
Yeah.

47:45.083 --> 47:47.250
So, what are we doing?

48:18.500 --> 48:19.792
All right.

48:22.458 --> 48:23.458
We're here.

48:23.583 --> 48:24.958
We're where?

48:25.583 --> 48:26.625
Come on.

48:34.667 --> 48:36.083
Where are we?

48:36.875 --> 48:38.625
What's that?

48:39.167 --> 48:40.875
Whose house is this?

48:41.583 --> 48:44.167
Yeah. No, l don't really like anything.

48:47.833 --> 48:49.125
Excuse me.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.625
l'm talking to you.

48:55.542 --> 48:57.333
Whose house is this?

48:57.875 --> 48:59.625
-This house?
-Yeah.

49:00.500 --> 49:01.542
My uncle's house.

49:03.458 --> 49:05.167
Well, where is your uncle?

49:07.167 --> 49:08.250
-Right over there.
-Where?

49:09.375 --> 49:10.500
Oh!

49:14.708 --> 49:16.333
What the fuck?

49:17.167 --> 49:18.250
Well, you were dirty.

49:18.625 --> 49:20.417
Yeah, now l'm wet.

49:21.208 --> 49:23.667
Oh, you're dirty and wet? l'm coming in.

49:28.125 --> 49:29.417
Now l'm dirty and wet, too.

49:36.667 --> 49:37.667
R-2!

49:39.583 --> 49:42.792
R-2! Shut down
all the fucking trash compactors!

49:44.333 --> 49:45.583
All the...

49:46.125 --> 49:47.125
R-2!

49:48.125 --> 49:49.250
R-2!

49:50.458 --> 49:52.458
All the fucking...

49:52.542 --> 49:55.292
Trash compactors on the detention level.

49:55.375 --> 49:57.958
Oh, shit! There's more trash coming in!

49:58.333 --> 49:59.292
Motherfuck!

50:01.042 --> 50:02.583
Motherfuck!

50:31.167 --> 50:32.958
How do you know this guy?

50:34.750 --> 50:36.958
l don't know. He's sort of moved in

50:37.042 --> 50:38.083
my grandma's house with us.

50:41.167 --> 50:44.542
What, you mean he's, like,
renting a room or something?

50:44.667 --> 50:45.625
No, not really.

50:51.167 --> 50:52.958
lt's kind of a long story.

50:57.708 --> 50:58.792
Fish!

50:59.500 --> 51:01.000
Fresh fish!

51:14.833 --> 51:15.958
Fire.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.583
Fuck you, bitches!

51:38.625 --> 51:40.417
Jump in the fire.

51:41.125 --> 51:43.250
l got a doctor's appointment.

51:44.500 --> 51:45.542
What?

51:48.375 --> 51:50.333
lt burns when l urinate.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Did he just leave us here?

52:00.833 --> 52:01.875
l think so.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.458
l think we should get out of here.

52:03.542 --> 52:04.792
Let's go.

52:09.333 --> 52:10.333
So what's his name?

52:12.792 --> 52:13.958
Hesher.

52:14.167 --> 52:15.958
Hesher? ls that a name?

52:16.875 --> 52:18.333
l don't know.

52:19.042 --> 52:20.417
Does he have a last name?

52:21.000 --> 52:22.458
l don't know.

52:27.833 --> 52:29.708
My shoes are so squishy.

52:30.042 --> 52:31.500
How old is he?

52:32.292 --> 52:33.333
l don't know.

52:33.458 --> 52:35.167
Do you know anything about him?

52:36.042 --> 52:37.542
No, not really.

52:38.083 --> 52:40.000
Man, that was lucky you were behind me

52:40.125 --> 52:42.750
when that guy got all mad about his car.

52:43.750 --> 52:46.792
l was freaking out.
l don't have insurance right now

52:46.875 --> 52:49.083
because l can't really afford it.

52:49.167 --> 52:51.958
And there's no way
l could afford to fix his car.

52:52.083 --> 52:54.167
How do people do this stuff?

52:55.042 --> 52:56.792
l mean, l have a job.

52:57.667 --> 53:00.083
lt's kind of a joke.
l mean, l've been there almost a year,

53:00.167 --> 53:03.167
and l still have only, like, 15 hours a week.

53:04.333 --> 53:06.667
Why don't they give me more hours?

53:07.208 --> 53:10.000
Do you think it's 'cause they think l suck?

53:10.875 --> 53:14.417
Did you think l sucked
when l served you at the checkout?

53:14.917 --> 53:15.917
No.

53:16.458 --> 53:19.750
l mean, l can't even afford
to pay my rent right now.

53:20.000 --> 53:23.292
l'm going to have
to start selling shit pretty soon.

53:24.250 --> 53:25.583
Here.

53:26.833 --> 53:28.042
l...

53:29.792 --> 53:31.333
l got two bucks.

53:33.000 --> 53:36.292
The sad thing is,
l could actually use it right now.

53:36.417 --> 53:38.167
-Then here. You can have it.
-No.

53:44.083 --> 53:45.250
Oh, no.

53:45.667 --> 53:48.083
Please tell me that's not a ticket.

53:48.250 --> 53:49.417
Oh, no.

53:52.208 --> 53:53.375
Fuck!

53:53.833 --> 53:55.458
Fuck, fuck! Fuck!

53:58.792 --> 54:00.333
Fuck. Shit.

54:30.333 --> 54:34.625
What did l do to deserve
this chain reaction of shit all the time?

54:39.875 --> 54:42.292
You know, l feel like if l died,

54:42.708 --> 54:44.667
no one would even notice.

54:57.958 --> 54:59.417
Well, l would.

55:04.083 --> 55:06.333
lf you were to die right now, l would notice.

55:12.500 --> 55:16.125
Mainly because l'd be sitting in a car
next to a dead lady.

55:18.500 --> 55:20.500
Please don't call me lady.

55:46.042 --> 55:47.292
Hi, T.J.

55:47.375 --> 55:48.750
Hi, Grandma.

55:48.917 --> 55:49.958
So...

55:52.500 --> 55:53.792
You fuck her?

55:53.917 --> 55:54.958
No.

55:56.292 --> 55:57.458
Where were you today?

55:59.500 --> 56:02.958
Counseling. 3:30. l'm there by myself.

56:03.458 --> 56:05.000
Sorry. l forgot.

56:05.667 --> 56:07.500
Oh, that's real nice.

56:09.667 --> 56:11.917
You know, it's just as much
for you as it is for me.

56:12.083 --> 56:14.292
l waited outside the school for 45 minutes.

56:14.417 --> 56:16.333
Yeah, well, l told you l don't want to go.

56:16.417 --> 56:19.583
Well, maybe you could let me know
when you decide not to show next time.

56:19.667 --> 56:21.458
-l did. l told you l didn't want to go.
-No, you didn't.

56:21.542 --> 56:22.792
l told you, like, a thousand times.

56:22.917 --> 56:23.958
-No, you didn't.
-Yes, l did.

56:24.083 --> 56:25.167
You're just not listening.

56:25.292 --> 56:26.417
You didn't tell me that.

56:26.500 --> 56:28.083
You told me you didn't want to go.

56:28.167 --> 56:29.792
You didn't tell me you were just
going to not show up.

56:30.458 --> 56:32.042
What difference does it make?

56:32.167 --> 56:34.125
For me, a big difference.

56:34.625 --> 56:37.875
Means l'm sitting in
a room full of losers by myself.

56:39.167 --> 56:41.208
Boys, please.

56:41.542 --> 56:43.542
l'm not feeling very well.

56:49.750 --> 56:51.375
Please pass me my pills.

57:12.750 --> 57:13.958
Did you finger her twat?

57:14.083 --> 57:15.208
Shut the fuck up!

57:15.333 --> 57:16.292
-T.J.!
-What?

57:16.417 --> 57:17.875
Language. l mean it.

57:18.000 --> 57:19.625
-Did you hear what he just said?
-lt doesn't matter.

57:19.708 --> 57:21.250
You talk like that again,
you're going to your room.

57:21.333 --> 57:23.792
My room?
You're going to start punishing me now?

57:23.875 --> 57:25.625
Yeah. Maybe l am. lf it's not the language,

57:25.708 --> 57:27.208
then it's your lack of responsibility.

57:29.333 --> 57:32.125
Me having to escort you
to the police station.

57:34.500 --> 57:35.625
Shit, Dad. l'm really sorry

57:35.750 --> 57:37.458
you had your ass dragged off the couch.

57:37.542 --> 57:39.500
And l'm sorry you had to put
some fucking underpants on

57:39.583 --> 57:40.708
for the first time in months.

57:40.833 --> 57:42.083
-T.J.!
-What!

57:42.167 --> 57:44.583
Hey! That's enough.

57:45.500 --> 57:46.792
So as soon as l'm right, that's enough?

57:47.583 --> 57:50.000
l don't want to hear another word from you.

57:50.083 --> 57:51.125
Fine.

57:51.500 --> 57:52.917
Fuck this!

57:55.500 --> 57:57.292
That make you happy, huh?

58:19.875 --> 58:20.958
Did l miss something?

58:22.708 --> 58:24.042
Not really.

58:24.542 --> 58:26.000
He said some dumb shit.

58:26.125 --> 58:27.917
He smashed his plate,

58:28.083 --> 58:29.125
so he smashed his.

58:30.125 --> 58:32.458
But l think he just did it
'cause he couldn't think of anything to say.

58:32.542 --> 58:33.958
The kid had a point.

58:35.208 --> 58:37.250
So he felt bad about himself.

58:37.333 --> 58:39.542
He left. l don't know where...

58:44.042 --> 58:45.292
l wish...

58:45.667 --> 58:48.708
l wish there were
something more l could do.

59:15.042 --> 59:16.083
lt's delicious.

59:16.167 --> 59:17.917
Oh. Thank you, dear.

59:24.042 --> 59:25.375
Hey.

59:25.500 --> 59:27.583
What's green and slimy
and smells like bacon?

59:29.000 --> 59:30.708
l don't know, dear.

59:33.667 --> 59:35.708
Think about it. What's green and slimy

59:35.833 --> 59:36.958
and smells like bacon?

59:37.083 --> 59:38.708
A worm? l don't know.

59:40.583 --> 59:43.625
Going to lie down. Still not feeling too well.

59:46.208 --> 59:47.500
All right.

01:00:06.167 --> 01:00:07.208
Hey.

01:00:07.667 --> 01:00:08.875
You figure it out?

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.417
Figure what out, dear?

01:00:11.875 --> 01:00:14.792
What's green and slimy
and smells like bacon?

01:00:16.833 --> 01:00:18.542
l don't know.

01:00:19.042 --> 01:00:20.667
Would you do me a favor, please?

01:00:20.875 --> 01:00:21.917
Yeah.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.917
Could you hand me that old container

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.042
on top of the cabinet?

01:00:26.833 --> 01:00:28.042
Which one? This one?

01:00:28.167 --> 01:00:29.708
Yeah. Thank you.

01:00:36.167 --> 01:00:38.333
lt's Kermit the Frog's finger.

01:00:39.333 --> 01:00:42.042
You know, 'cause Miss Piggy.

01:00:43.833 --> 01:00:45.125
What's that?

01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:48.042
Oh, they're medical cigarettes
to help with the nausea.

01:00:48.667 --> 01:00:50.958
Would you please light a match for me?

01:00:51.083 --> 01:00:53.583
Yeah. Can l just see that real quick?

01:00:59.958 --> 01:01:01.625
l'll be right back.

01:01:07.333 --> 01:01:08.333
May l?

01:01:11.042 --> 01:01:12.208
Thanks.

01:01:12.792 --> 01:01:14.208
What is that?

01:01:14.667 --> 01:01:16.167
That is a bong.

01:01:17.375 --> 01:01:19.250
lt's got water in it. lt filters the smoke.

01:01:19.333 --> 01:01:21.458
lt's actually probably
the healthiest way to smoke weed.

01:01:25.125 --> 01:01:26.542
l'll show you how to do it.

01:01:27.333 --> 01:01:28.500
You see that hole right there?

01:01:28.625 --> 01:01:30.667
You got to keep your finger on that.

01:01:30.792 --> 01:01:32.750
Then, you light the bowl.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.542
Then, when the thing
fills up with smoke like that,

01:01:40.667 --> 01:01:43.000
you let go right here. Then you...

01:01:44.917 --> 01:01:46.583
Here.

01:01:48.125 --> 01:01:49.500
Here you go.

01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:53.792
l'll light it for you. Here.

01:01:53.875 --> 01:01:55.042
Just turn it like that.

01:01:55.167 --> 01:01:57.458
Hang on. Put your thumb
on the hole right there.

01:01:57.958 --> 01:02:00.667
l'll light this, and you suck. Okay? Yeah.

01:02:02.375 --> 01:02:04.042
Go ahead and suck.

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.125
Yeah. Here you go.

01:02:09.917 --> 01:02:12.333
Lift your thumb. Big breath. Big breath.

01:02:14.625 --> 01:02:15.667
Yeah.

01:02:22.458 --> 01:02:24.125
Oh, my.

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:25.875
Hit it again.

01:02:27.375 --> 01:02:28.667
No. l...

01:02:30.292 --> 01:02:32.833
l think l'm okay. Thank you.

01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:35.667
All right. l'll just finish this off.

01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:50.667
Honey, how old are you?

01:02:52.125 --> 01:02:53.167
Who wants to know?

01:02:54.333 --> 01:02:55.792
l don't know.

01:02:57.625 --> 01:02:59.625
You seem a little older than T.J.

01:03:01.792 --> 01:03:02.750
Who?

01:03:02.875 --> 01:03:04.250
Oh, stop it.

01:03:06.292 --> 01:03:09.333
Aren't you a little old
to be hanging around T.J. all the time?

01:03:09.917 --> 01:03:11.167
Aren't you?

01:03:11.292 --> 01:03:13.750
No. l'm his grandmother.

01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:17.625
That's true.

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.750
You know, l...

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:26.375
l used to have this snake. Big fucker.

01:03:28.583 --> 01:03:29.708
l used to have to feed him.

01:03:29.833 --> 01:03:31.750
Once a week, l'd give him a live mouse.

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:33.625
Yeah.

01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:36.458
You know, snakes. You know they're snakes

01:03:37.125 --> 01:03:39.417
because they're the right shape.

01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:44.750
Well, anyway, this one ate mice.

01:03:46.167 --> 01:03:48.125
And there was this one time

01:03:48.208 --> 01:03:50.375
l dropped a mouse in his cage,

01:03:50.667 --> 01:03:53.542
and he got a whiff of it, so he went for him,

01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:56.708
and this mouse

01:03:58.292 --> 01:04:00.125
got up on his hind legs

01:04:00.417 --> 01:04:01.625
and punched him in the face.

01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:03.125
You're kidding.

01:04:04.667 --> 01:04:06.958
Happened again, too.
The snake went for him again.

01:04:07.083 --> 01:04:08.542
Hit him again.

01:04:10.167 --> 01:04:11.125
Snake didn't know what to do.

01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:12.708
Got a little fucked up.

01:04:12.833 --> 01:04:15.125
Went off in the corner and cried.

01:04:15.875 --> 01:04:17.458
And that fucking mouse ruled the cage.

01:04:18.208 --> 01:04:19.958
Went on for weeks. He just, like,

01:04:20.042 --> 01:04:22.625
walked around like he owned the joint.

01:04:23.083 --> 01:04:25.875
Sitting in a little lawn chair or something,

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.958
scratching his balls, shelling peanuts.

01:04:28.042 --> 01:04:30.500
l mean, like, defiant.

01:04:32.792 --> 01:04:35.125
Yeah. l tried to feed him other mice, too.

01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:37.125
But l'd drop the new mouse into the cage,

01:04:37.208 --> 01:04:39.458
and he'd just hide behind the old mouse.

01:04:39.583 --> 01:04:42.083
The snake's scared shitless.

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.458
He died. Starved to death.

01:04:47.917 --> 01:04:48.958
Yeah.

01:04:49.583 --> 01:04:51.250
Cage full of mice.

01:04:52.542 --> 01:04:54.375
So is T.J. the mouse?

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:00.458
l don't know. Maybe he is.

01:05:02.167 --> 01:05:03.333
Who the hell am l?

01:05:03.792 --> 01:05:04.792
You?

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.667
You're an old lady.

01:05:08.083 --> 01:05:09.083
No.

01:05:10.833 --> 01:05:12.458
l'm a grandmother.

01:05:14.167 --> 01:05:16.792
Yeah. You're a grandmother.

01:05:19.667 --> 01:05:21.125
You know what?

01:05:21.375 --> 01:05:24.125
Grandmother, l'm going to go
on that walk with you tomorrow morning.

01:05:25.208 --> 01:05:27.958
Oh, no. That's nice.

01:05:31.167 --> 01:05:32.250
Where are you going?

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.750
l don't know. l'm gonna go with you.

01:05:34.833 --> 01:05:36.792
Wherever. Around the block, l guess.

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.625
Well, have...

01:05:43.083 --> 01:05:44.333
Good time.

01:05:44.458 --> 01:05:45.833
No, l'm going to go with you.

01:05:45.958 --> 01:05:47.125
Well...

01:05:48.333 --> 01:05:50.083
See you when you get back.

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.458
Why don't you send him over? Sure.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.625
Can l talk to you?

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:09.250
Hold on a minute. l'm on the phone.
Can you see that?

01:08:09.333 --> 01:08:10.333
l need to talk to you.

01:08:10.458 --> 01:08:12.458
l'm on the... Wait outside.

01:08:13.542 --> 01:08:15.000
Wait outside.

01:08:31.667 --> 01:08:34.292
Did you come here
so l can break your fucking neck?

01:08:36.667 --> 01:08:37.750
What?

01:08:37.957 --> 01:08:39.292
l got the money.

01:08:39.375 --> 01:08:40.417
What money?

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:43.125
You said if l got $1,800,
then l could have the car back.

01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:46.457
Are you kidding?
l said even if you had $1,800,

01:08:46.582 --> 01:08:47.707
l still couldn't sell it to you.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.375
lt's not here anymore, anyway.

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:50.500
What do you mean?

01:08:50.625 --> 01:08:54.082
l feel like l've had this conversation
too many times already. But l'm telling you,

01:08:54.167 --> 01:08:55.667
l'm not going to have it again,
because the car's gone.

01:08:55.792 --> 01:08:57.792
-What are you talking about?
-lt's not here.

01:08:57.917 --> 01:08:58.957
lt's over. lt's gone.

01:08:59.042 --> 01:09:00.000
Well, where's it gone?

01:09:00.125 --> 01:09:02.082
Kid, it's all over. Go.

01:09:02.792 --> 01:09:04.707
Goodbye. Go.

01:10:19.917 --> 01:10:21.458
What's going on?

01:10:53.917 --> 01:10:56.625
l got to get the fuck out of here
before l hurt somebody.

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.708
Hi, it's Nicole. I'm not in right now.

01:11:52.833 --> 01:11:54.375
Leave a message, and I'll call you back.

01:11:57.333 --> 01:11:58.833
Hi. lt's T.J.

01:12:03.417 --> 01:12:05.333
Sorry to bug you, but...

01:12:05.458 --> 01:12:07.458
I guess I just wanted to talk to you.

01:12:07.583 --> 01:12:10.750
I have a present for you, so I guess I'll just...

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.208
Come by and drop it off or something, or...

01:12:15.333 --> 01:12:18.792
Yeah. Okay. Bye.

01:13:29.667 --> 01:13:30.792
Fuck you!

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.792
Hey! You!

01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:10.667
The fuck do you think you're doing?

01:14:10.792 --> 01:14:11.875
Back the fuck up!

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.292
-Fuck, man!
-Fuck you!

01:14:13.583 --> 01:14:14.625
-Chill out.
-Shut the fuck up.

01:14:14.708 --> 01:14:16.042
And you're a fucking whore!

01:14:16.167 --> 01:14:18.542
Hope you die. When you do,
no one's going to fucking notice,

01:14:18.667 --> 01:14:20.333
'cause you're just a fat, fucking prostitute.

01:14:20.458 --> 01:14:21.833
-Dude, chill out, all right?
-Back the fuck up!

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:23.875
l'll smash you in the face. l swear to God.

01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:26.333
l never want to see you
or your ugly fucking faces again!

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:28.625
That goes for both you fucking assholes.

01:15:09.708 --> 01:15:11.208
Fuck you!

01:15:12.375 --> 01:15:14.167
l fucking hate you!

01:15:38.542 --> 01:15:40.667
Hey. l want to talk to you.

01:15:42.417 --> 01:15:43.625
Hey. Dude, l want to talk to you.

01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:44.708
Get your fucking hands off me.

01:15:44.833 --> 01:15:47.000
Dude, calm down. Calm the...

01:15:47.125 --> 01:15:49.250
No! Fuck! God damn it!

01:15:49.333 --> 01:15:50.458
l said l just want to fucking talk to you!

01:15:50.542 --> 01:15:51.542
Get off me!

01:15:51.667 --> 01:15:52.625
Calm the fuck down!

01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:55.125
Hey! Hey! Get off him! What are you doing?

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:57.125
-Come on!
-l'll fucking cut you!

01:15:57.208 --> 01:15:58.375
-You...
-Fuck! No!

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:00.000
-T.J.! No!
-No!

01:16:04.375 --> 01:16:06.583
Fuck both of you motherfuckers!

01:16:12.458 --> 01:16:13.667
You okay?

01:16:25.333 --> 01:16:26.417
T.J.?

01:17:24.833 --> 01:17:27.958
I actually went through 15 months of school.

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.125
Went through their extensive training

01:17:30.208 --> 01:17:32.917
in mathematics, physics, chemistry.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.167
They train you to be the best
and expect you to be the best.

01:17:36.292 --> 01:17:38.125
It probably would have cost me around...

01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:35.167
-Where's my car?
-What the fuck!

01:18:35.292 --> 01:18:36.583
-Where's the fucking car?
-Are you crazy?

01:18:36.667 --> 01:18:37.750
Make me ask one more time,

01:18:37.833 --> 01:18:38.958
your fucking toe's coming off. Where is it?

01:18:39.083 --> 01:18:40.333
lt's gone to the wrecker's!

01:18:40.458 --> 01:18:41.708
Fuck!

01:18:41.833 --> 01:18:43.958
lt's gone to the fucking wrecking yard, fool!

01:18:44.042 --> 01:18:45.208
That's fucking bullshit.

01:18:45.333 --> 01:18:46.333
Why would l be lying?

01:18:46.458 --> 01:18:48.292
Because you're a fucking asshole!
Now, tell me where it is!

01:18:48.417 --> 01:18:50.208
lt's gone to the fucking wrecking yard!

01:18:50.333 --> 01:18:52.333
l swear to God. Ah, fuck!

01:18:53.125 --> 01:18:54.250
Fuck!

01:18:54.333 --> 01:18:56.708
lf you're lying, l'm going to cut off
every one of your fucking toes.

01:18:56.833 --> 01:18:58.167
You understand me?

01:19:00.917 --> 01:19:01.958
Yeah.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.500
Anything else you want to fucking tell me?

01:19:13.625 --> 01:19:14.792
You want to come in my house?

01:19:14.875 --> 01:19:15.958
-Get the fuck off me!
-What, bitch?

01:19:23.583 --> 01:19:24.792
Fuck!

01:19:29.333 --> 01:19:30.833
Fuck! My nose!

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.292
What the hell are you doing?

01:19:33.375 --> 01:19:34.792
-My nose!
-What?

01:19:34.875 --> 01:19:37.167
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:19:38.375 --> 01:19:39.458
l just saved you.

01:19:39.583 --> 01:19:41.625
l told you l never want
to fucking see you again!

01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:43.625
How many times do l need to tell you?

01:19:43.708 --> 01:19:45.458
Just leave me alone!

01:22:16.708 --> 01:22:18.542
Come on, honey.

01:22:20.042 --> 01:22:21.792
Come on, sweetheart.

01:22:22.083 --> 01:22:23.917
What the hell is in this thing?

01:22:24.417 --> 01:22:26.375
Come on, guys. We got to go.

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:27.625
We're going to be late.

01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:29.750
What about the pizza?

01:22:30.042 --> 01:22:31.542
You can eat it in the car.

01:22:31.667 --> 01:22:32.792
Cool.

01:22:32.958 --> 01:22:34.583
Honey, what is in here?

01:22:35.833 --> 01:22:38.042
You know what?
Let's take my car. You drive.

01:22:46.292 --> 01:22:47.750
Can you get the door?

01:22:47.833 --> 01:22:48.917
Sure.

01:22:51.792 --> 01:22:54.208
l think we should keep the new one
and give them our old one.

01:22:55.167 --> 01:22:56.833
That's a great idea.

01:22:56.958 --> 01:22:58.000
l'll be sure to let them know

01:22:58.125 --> 01:23:00.083
that our old, dirty microwave
was a gift from you.

01:23:01.333 --> 01:23:02.458
Good.

01:23:02.667 --> 01:23:04.708
They don't even know who l am, anyway.

01:23:04.833 --> 01:23:06.500
Honey, they're my friends.

01:23:07.292 --> 01:23:08.458
l know.

01:23:09.167 --> 01:23:12.458
l just don't know why we need
to give them so many presents.

01:23:12.542 --> 01:23:15.583
A microwave and a bottle of scotch
is hardly a lot of presents.

01:23:15.792 --> 01:23:17.125
And flowers?

01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:19.417
-And flowers.
-And flowers.

01:23:19.833 --> 01:23:20.958
Mom, can you turn the radio on?

01:23:21.042 --> 01:23:22.167
Yeah, baby.

01:24:22.458 --> 01:24:23.667
Help!

01:24:27.833 --> 01:24:28.958
Hey!

01:24:32.083 --> 01:24:33.292
Hey!

01:24:34.125 --> 01:24:35.792
What are you doing?

01:24:36.625 --> 01:24:37.708
Get back. Get back.

01:24:39.125 --> 01:24:40.333
Get back!

01:24:40.792 --> 01:24:41.958
What the hell are you doing?

01:24:45.167 --> 01:24:46.542
l don't know.

01:25:48.167 --> 01:25:49.875
Where have you been?

01:25:51.417 --> 01:25:52.542
Sorry.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.708
Where have you been?

01:25:55.167 --> 01:25:56.375
l'm sorry.

01:25:56.833 --> 01:25:57.875
lt's 10:00 in the morning.

01:25:58.958 --> 01:26:00.417
How is this fair to me?

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:02.917
l don't know.

01:26:09.542 --> 01:26:11.083
Go to your room.

01:26:35.667 --> 01:26:38.083
Someone's at the front door for you.

01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:54.625
Hesher's not here.

01:26:56.833 --> 01:26:58.083
l came to see you.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.542
l didn't know if l should come or not.

01:27:06.125 --> 01:27:08.458
But l couldn't stop thinking about it.

01:27:09.083 --> 01:27:12.542
l thought if l came,
you'd still be angry and hate me.

01:27:14.292 --> 01:27:15.750
But then l thought if l didn't come,

01:27:15.875 --> 01:27:17.958
you'd think l didn't care
and you'd hate me anyway,

01:27:18.083 --> 01:27:20.750
so l figured l might as well come.

01:27:22.125 --> 01:27:23.792
Just in case, so...

01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:26.542
Here l am.

01:27:36.667 --> 01:27:37.917
Well, what do you want?

01:27:40.208 --> 01:27:41.958
l want to apologize.

01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:45.625
l feel bad about what happened.

01:27:45.917 --> 01:27:47.417
lt doesn't really matter.

01:27:47.542 --> 01:27:48.708
lt does matter.

01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:51.083
lt matters to me.

01:27:52.667 --> 01:27:54.458
l really like you, T.J.

01:27:56.667 --> 01:27:59.833
And l understand
if you don't want to be my friend,

01:28:01.833 --> 01:28:04.458
but l didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

01:28:07.083 --> 01:28:08.292
l just...

01:28:10.125 --> 01:28:11.583
Sometimes, l...

01:28:13.583 --> 01:28:14.833
l don't know.

01:28:15.708 --> 01:28:17.958
But l thought l should come over
and say that,

01:28:18.042 --> 01:28:20.667
so you can still hate me anyway, but...

01:28:22.125 --> 01:28:24.417
l just thought l'd come say that.

01:28:24.667 --> 01:28:26.292
And now l said it.

01:28:28.667 --> 01:28:29.958
Okay, bye.

01:28:32.792 --> 01:28:34.083
Sorry l broke your lamp.

01:28:37.083 --> 01:28:38.083
lt's okay.

01:28:38.875 --> 01:28:40.875
And l'm sorry l called you a fat prostitute.

01:28:43.208 --> 01:28:44.500
lt's okay.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.292
You're not fat.

01:28:49.250 --> 01:28:51.083
But l am a prostitute?

01:28:52.875 --> 01:28:55.208
l don't know. Maybe.

01:29:57.792 --> 01:29:59.333
We are gathered here today

01:29:59.458 --> 01:30:03.125
to mourn the loss and commemorate the life

01:30:03.250 --> 01:30:05.458
of Madeleine Frances Forney.

01:30:05.792 --> 01:30:12.000
Madeleine was a beloved wife,
mother, grandmother, and friend.

01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:18.792
And now Mrs. Rosowski,
a dear friend and neighbor,

01:30:19.125 --> 01:30:21.083
will say a few quick words.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.292
l did not know Madeleine long enough.

01:30:40.083 --> 01:30:42.958
From the moment l moved
into the neighborhood,

01:30:43.042 --> 01:30:46.583
she treated me as if l was one of the family.

01:30:47.458 --> 01:30:50.792
She had such a kind, wonderful heart.

01:30:51.167 --> 01:30:54.583
We shared many wonderful walks

01:30:55.292 --> 01:30:58.417
and enjoyed each other's company
very much.

01:30:58.917 --> 01:31:00.958
l will miss our walks

01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:03.583
and most of all, our talks.

01:31:04.083 --> 01:31:07.000
l will always remember what she told me.

01:31:07.125 --> 01:31:09.458
''Life is like walking in the rain.

01:31:10.375 --> 01:31:15.167
''You can... You can hide and take cover,

01:31:16.167 --> 01:31:19.917
''or you can just get wet.''

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.375
Okay. Thank you, Mrs. Rosowski.

01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:49.542
T.J.?

01:31:51.042 --> 01:31:53.042
l think you should say something.

01:31:57.125 --> 01:31:58.542
Come on, T.J.

01:32:22.833 --> 01:32:23.958
Sorry.

01:32:26.458 --> 01:32:27.792
Okay, so now at this point,

01:32:27.875 --> 01:32:29.083
we should conclude the service with...

01:32:36.167 --> 01:32:39.250
Yeah, l just want to add something
to what the kid said

01:32:39.333 --> 01:32:42.542
'cause l think l know
where he was going with that.

01:32:42.667 --> 01:32:44.708
What are you doing? Come on.

01:32:44.833 --> 01:32:46.792
Sir, we have to go...

01:32:46.875 --> 01:32:48.792
Don't fucking touch me.

01:32:51.125 --> 01:32:53.500
Back up. Sit down.

01:33:00.042 --> 01:33:01.458
l know you don't want me here,

01:33:01.583 --> 01:33:03.083
l don't even want to be here, all right?

01:33:03.208 --> 01:33:04.500
l didn't come here for me.

01:33:04.625 --> 01:33:07.292
l fucking came here for her.

01:33:09.208 --> 01:33:10.583
Now, she's been trying
to tell you guys something,

01:33:10.667 --> 01:33:11.917
but you're too fucked up to listen,

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.958
so if you'll just shut up for a second,

01:33:15.042 --> 01:33:17.333
l'm gonna say what l want to say.

01:33:18.167 --> 01:33:19.583
Then you'll never see me again.

01:33:37.792 --> 01:33:39.958
l pulled this gas tank from an old Chevy.

01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:42.792
l wanted to blow it up, so l did.

01:33:43.167 --> 01:33:46.083
What l didn't think about was all the,
you know, little bits of metal

01:33:46.167 --> 01:33:48.792
that were gonna fly in every direction.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.042
And l almost killed myself.

01:33:50.667 --> 01:33:52.292
l woke up in this hospital.

01:33:52.417 --> 01:33:54.917
And this doctor was like, ''Son.''

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.333
And l said, ''Don't call me son,
you fucking cunt.''

01:33:56.458 --> 01:33:59.417
And then, he was, like,
''You blew off your nut.''

01:34:02.708 --> 01:34:04.083
l just lost my nut like that.

01:34:05.208 --> 01:34:06.750
l went fucking crazy.

01:34:06.833 --> 01:34:09.583
l assaulted a nurse
or a doctor, l don't remember,

01:34:09.667 --> 01:34:12.167
but l got arrested, l went to juvie.

01:34:12.333 --> 01:34:14.167
All l could think about
was my fucking nut, man.

01:34:14.292 --> 01:34:15.917
l'm missing a nut.

01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:17.792
What am l gonna do?

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.125
l had to go looking for it, right?

01:34:20.208 --> 01:34:22.250
So l busted out ofjuvie
and l went searching,

01:34:22.375 --> 01:34:23.417
couldn't find my nut.

01:34:29.667 --> 01:34:32.750
Well, there was this one night,

01:34:34.417 --> 01:34:35.917
l was sitting there and l was taking a shit,

01:34:36.125 --> 01:34:40.667
l was looking at my balls
and staring at this little piece of flabby sack

01:34:40.792 --> 01:34:42.917
where my left nut used to be.

01:34:44.333 --> 01:34:47.625
And then,
l saw my right nut for the first time.

01:34:49.333 --> 01:34:52.250
l was like, ''Fuck, man! My nut!

01:34:52.917 --> 01:34:54.875
''Look, l have... l still have a nut.''

01:34:55.625 --> 01:34:56.750
Right?

01:34:58.708 --> 01:35:00.250
lt's a good nut. lt works.

01:35:00.333 --> 01:35:02.417
God or the fucking devil
or whoever the fuck it is,

01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:04.208
you know, he left me with one good nut.

01:35:04.333 --> 01:35:06.583
l still have a fucking nut and it works,

01:35:06.667 --> 01:35:08.958
and my fucking dick works, too.

01:35:16.292 --> 01:35:18.250
Okay, you lost your wife.

01:35:24.625 --> 01:35:26.208
And you lost your mom.

01:35:32.375 --> 01:35:33.833
l lost my nut.

01:35:41.917 --> 01:35:43.125
Fuck this.

01:35:50.833 --> 01:35:53.292
Hey, hey! Don't fucking touch that!

01:35:53.708 --> 01:35:56.625
Get your fucking hands
off the box! Go! Move!

01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:57.792
Go!

01:35:58.667 --> 01:36:01.375
l told Grandma that l was gonna
go on a walk with her.

01:36:03.250 --> 01:36:04.583
That's what l'm gonna do.

01:36:07.958 --> 01:36:09.792
You told Grandma
you were gonna go on a walk with her.

01:36:10.958 --> 01:36:12.208
This is your last chance.

01:38:25.833 --> 01:38:27.792
Good morning, Teej.

01:38:31.583 --> 01:38:32.583
Whoa.

01:38:32.708 --> 01:38:34.708
l know. lt's weird, right?

01:38:35.125 --> 01:38:37.583
l can feel the air on my face again.

01:38:37.958 --> 01:38:39.125
lt looks good.

01:38:40.417 --> 01:38:41.583
Thanks.

01:38:42.375 --> 01:38:43.417
Hesher's gone.

01:38:44.333 --> 01:38:45.458
What do you mean?

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.292
l think you should come see this.
