WEBVTT

00:08.717 --> 00:11.094
-Ugh, Christmas sucked!

00:11.177 --> 00:13.346
You got the worst presents!

00:13.430 --> 00:15.765
Nicky,
I don't hear you packing in there.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.768
And now I have to go
on this garbage-ass ski vacation

00:18.852 --> 00:22.147
at a garbage-ass luxury resort
with my garbage-ass family.

00:22.230 --> 00:26.151
And don't forget,
Andrew's garbage ass is coming too.

00:26.234 --> 00:29.404
Also, I'm excited
to go on a big fancy airplane

00:29.487 --> 00:31.531
and touch all the buttons
around your seat.

00:31.614 --> 00:33.074
Am I doing hate right?

00:33.158 --> 00:33.992
No!

00:34.075 --> 00:35.702
Okay, I love you guys.

00:35.785 --> 00:38.955
Ooh, Leah, I can't believe
you're gonna finally fuck Val!

00:39.039 --> 00:41.374
Yeah, I'm just going to do it.
Right, Bonnie?

00:41.458 --> 00:43.960
I mean, everyone knows
the first time sucks anyway.

00:44.044 --> 00:44.878
Well, hold on.

00:44.961 --> 00:49.132
Like my sister Connie says,
sex is supposed to be savored,

00:49.215 --> 00:51.259
like a precious little ravioli.

00:51.342 --> 00:53.053
What? I didn't know you had a sister.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.972
Oh, yeah, me and Connie are Gemini twins.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.515
We came out sixty-nining.

00:57.599 --> 00:59.142
Okay.

00:59.225 --> 01:03.396
Your pussy-eating sister aside,
it's probably not gonna be good, right?

01:03.480 --> 01:04.439
I don't know.

01:04.522 --> 01:08.651
Val did promise your little brother
he's gonna boink you till you happy cry.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.528
-Huh.
-And I want that for you.

01:10.612 --> 01:11.571
Okay, yeah.

01:11.654 --> 01:13.448
Maybe it will be good. All right.

01:13.531 --> 01:16.284
I'm gonna lose my virginity
to Val Bilzerian.

01:16.367 --> 01:17.952
No, no, no!

01:18.036 --> 01:20.872
You're gonna win your virginity
to Val Bilzerian.

01:20.955 --> 01:23.333
Oh, shit, we talking about virginity?

01:23.416 --> 01:25.293
Giving, taking or returning?

01:25.376 --> 01:28.379
Connie LaCienega,
what the heck are you doing here?

01:28.463 --> 01:31.841
Well, Bonnie LaCienega,
I wanted to give you a heads-up

01:31.925 --> 01:34.302
that Maury's also going on the trip.

01:34.385 --> 01:38.890
Do you think you two can be civil
with each other for once? For me?

01:38.973 --> 01:40.767
Your sixty-nining twin sister?

01:40.850 --> 01:43.561
Connie, the dude is a deadbeat!

01:43.645 --> 01:45.563
You'd fuck him if you got to know him.

01:45.647 --> 01:48.525
Okay. Did he or did he not
use your credit card

01:48.608 --> 01:52.028
to buy a $100,000
baby Beanie Feldstein Beanie Baby?

01:52.112 --> 01:55.281
That baby Beanie Beanie Baby
was an investment, baby.

01:55.365 --> 01:59.119
Baby, between you and me, he shouldn't
have bought that baby Beanie Beanie Baby.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.913
Well, this is not
the Jonah Hill I will die on.

02:01.996 --> 02:03.456
Have a good trip!

02:37.407 --> 02:40.243
Mmm! Mott's spicy tomato juice.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.412
And look, Madagascar 4!

02:43.621 --> 02:45.790
This is the Birch life, Nicky baby.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.835
Ugh! His feet smell like salad dressing.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.879
Leah, did you remember
to bring your skates?

02:50.962 --> 02:51.838
Yes, Mom.

02:51.921 --> 02:54.048
Val, you have to see Leah ice skate.

02:54.132 --> 02:57.802
She's been obsessed with it ever since
I took her to see Broad City on Ice.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.180
Mmm, I would love to see Leah on ice.

03:00.263 --> 03:03.099
Oh, yeah?
You want to go ice skating with me?

03:03.183 --> 03:05.518
I want to whack your knees with a pipe.

03:05.602 --> 03:08.855
Ooh! Let's go join the mile high club!

03:08.938 --> 03:11.691
I'm not losing my virginity
in an airplane bathroom.

03:11.774 --> 03:14.235
Besides, Andrew's already
been in there twice,

03:14.319 --> 03:15.820
and he had all that tomato juice.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.865
What, you don't like to fuck
in small places that smell like shit?

03:18.948 --> 03:22.785
Maury, your gross, marinara-guzzlin'
kid is ruining this trip.

03:22.869 --> 03:25.496
What do you got against tomato juice?
It's delicious.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.415
It tastes like a vegetable's period.

03:27.498 --> 03:28.833
I don't know, Elliot.

03:28.917 --> 03:32.128
It seems early for Leah
to be bringing a boyfriend on a trip.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.047
What if they have sex this weekend?

03:34.130 --> 03:35.715
Diane Keaton Birch.

03:35.798 --> 03:39.719
When we became parents, we took a test,
and that test came back sex-positive.

03:39.802 --> 03:41.763
I just don't know if I'm ready.

03:41.846 --> 03:43.806
-If Leah's ready, we're ready.
-Ugh.

03:43.890 --> 03:48.269
And I for one can't wait
to break my daddy hymen. Boop.

03:49.312 --> 03:52.815
-"Hello! My name is Lola Skumpy.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.901
I'm legally obligated to inform you

03:54.984 --> 03:59.197
that I am a registered 'sex offender'
for doing revenge porn."

03:59.280 --> 04:01.199
But, like, in a totally hilarious way

04:01.282 --> 04:03.785
that has most of the people
at home rooting for me.

04:03.868 --> 04:06.996
I'm, like, L-O-Ling for real. L-O-L Lola.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.289
Psst! Hey, kid, over here.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.875
Okay, look, man,
I'm banned from that magic store,

04:10.959 --> 04:14.712
so just go in there and buy me
a--a couple of linking rings, maybe?

04:14.796 --> 04:16.839
Limerick,
don't talk to that creepy magician.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.633
Well, joke's on you, lady.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.885
'Cause I'm not
a magician anymore.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.887
I broke the sacred code!

04:22.971 --> 04:25.682
Well, well, well,
look at what the cat shit out.

04:25.765 --> 04:28.059
I bet you want to, like,
throttle me right now.

04:28.142 --> 04:32.063
No, Lola. I don't want to do
anything to you anymore.

04:32.146 --> 04:37.694
I'm just a loose, empty foreskin
with, ta-da, no coin inside. You win.

04:37.777 --> 04:40.113
Alas, like the war on drugs,

04:40.196 --> 04:44.575
I might have won, but, like, at what cost?

04:46.661 --> 04:50.123
You guys, holy shit!
There's a phone in the bathroom.

04:50.206 --> 04:52.125
Ooh, let's use it to call for movie times.

04:52.208 --> 04:55.670
-Well, see you later, everybody.
-Whoa, whoa. Where are you two going?

04:55.753 --> 04:58.715
-Uh, to our room?
-I thought Val was sleeping with Judd.

04:58.798 --> 05:01.301
I'm sleeping in the woods. Peace, losers.

05:02.593 --> 05:05.972
There's only three rooms,
and Dad said Val and I could have our own.

05:06.055 --> 05:07.765
Without consulting me?

05:07.849 --> 05:09.976
I thought I speak for you
and you speak for me.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.311
Well, who said that?

05:11.394 --> 05:14.856
Well, I did, but I was speaking for you,
so it was kind of like you said it to me.

05:14.939 --> 05:16.566
Okay. I'm going to take a bath.

05:16.649 --> 05:19.986
And Elliot?
I will sprinkle my own rose petals on top.

05:20.069 --> 05:20.945
Oh, no.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.196
So how do you wanna do this?

05:22.280 --> 05:25.908
Connie and I usually just sleep in a pile
with our thumb up each other's asses.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.911
Well, I hold myself
to a higher standard than Connie.

05:28.995 --> 05:33.124
For example, she refers to herself
as a hormone "monstress,"

05:33.207 --> 05:35.710
whereas I prefer hormone "monster,"

05:35.793 --> 05:38.254
You don't call
a female doctor a "doctress."

05:38.338 --> 05:40.173
Oh, I most certainly do.

05:40.256 --> 05:42.342
But I don't call my dentist a "dentress."

05:42.425 --> 05:43.843
I call her my tooth barber.

05:43.926 --> 05:45.970
What do you call your dental hygienist?

05:46.054 --> 05:47.472
Tooth barber's little helper.

05:49.057 --> 05:52.852
Looks like I won't be needing
my instruments of magic anymore.

05:52.935 --> 05:57.190
-Abraca-dumpster.
-Hey, kid, I like tricks.

05:57.273 --> 05:59.192
I'll let you dazzle me.

05:59.275 --> 06:02.445
Really? Even though
I'm a disbarred magician?

06:02.528 --> 06:05.490
Yeah, yeah, but first,
you gotta do something for me.

06:05.573 --> 06:09.786
I want you to sit on me with no pants,
like one of my college students.

06:09.869 --> 06:15.041
Okay,
so if I rub my balls all over your face,

06:15.124 --> 06:16.709
then you'll pick a card for me?

06:16.793 --> 06:19.253
Sure, but my bed bugs get to watch.

06:19.337 --> 06:23.257
Yeah, fuck our futon like
we're a couple of cuck-roaches.

06:23.341 --> 06:25.426
So the recipe
calls for Monterey Jack,

06:25.510 --> 06:27.428
but you can do it
with any shredded cheese.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.847
And you said you're putting
all of this in a pair of panties?

06:29.931 --> 06:32.517
Yeah, it's a panties burrito.
It's an easy weeknight meal.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.603
Oh, my God, Jay!
What the fuck are you doing?

06:35.686 --> 06:38.606
I'm getting ready
to dazzle this filthy futon.

06:38.689 --> 06:40.775
This is great. Jay has hit rock bottom.

06:40.858 --> 06:42.860
Perfect time for you to rock his bottom.

06:42.944 --> 06:46.197
Do I look like a Republican congressman
in an airport bathroom?

06:46.280 --> 06:48.533
I'm not taking advantage of him,
it's too sad.

06:48.616 --> 06:51.119
-Aw.
-I think I actually wanna help him?

06:51.202 --> 06:52.912
Whoa, kinky!

06:52.995 --> 06:55.248
Jay, put on your pants.
We're getting youÂ cleaned up.

06:55.331 --> 06:59.085
No offense, Matthew, but I'm not
worthy of a gay makeover montage.

06:59.168 --> 07:03.631
No offense taken, Jay, because I'm just
gonna hose you down in my driveway.

07:03.714 --> 07:05.842
-Do my parents not even care

07:05.925 --> 07:08.302
that Val's gonna
try to screw Leah tonight?

07:08.386 --> 07:11.055
Bad guys like him
get away with everything!

07:11.139 --> 07:13.933
And meanwhile,
you're stuck here with Dork Vader.

07:14.016 --> 07:16.227
Hey, Andrew,
can you turn that stupid thing off?

07:16.310 --> 07:17.395
I definitely cannot.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.605
You see,
without my pediatric CPAP machine,

07:19.689 --> 07:21.649
I'll choke myself to the edge of death.

07:21.732 --> 07:23.943
-But not in the way that he likes!

07:24.026 --> 07:26.487
So, shall we make-a da love?

07:26.571 --> 07:29.449
Why would you tell Leah
she and Val could have their own room?

07:29.532 --> 07:32.743
Leah asked, and I could never
say no to one of my kids,

07:32.827 --> 07:35.705
unless they asked me
if I could possibly love them more.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.582
-Ugh.
-And now for the love.

07:37.665 --> 07:40.042
I'm not "makin' da love," Elliot!

07:40.126 --> 07:41.919
I'm angry and I'm going to bed.

07:42.003 --> 07:45.423
No! If you go to bed angry,
I won't be able to sleep,

07:45.506 --> 07:48.801
and then I won't have the energy
to cherish you tomorrow.

07:48.885 --> 07:49.719
Ohâ¦

07:50.970 --> 07:54.724
Well, he's been digging his dick
into your hip for about 30 minutes,

07:54.807 --> 07:56.559
so I think he's ready if you are.

07:56.642 --> 08:00.354
Hey, it seems like
it might be time to go "ice skating."

08:00.438 --> 08:03.065
Sure, but I'd rather have sex.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.150
Yeah, sex.

08:04.233 --> 08:05.943
I mean sex, Val.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.946
Yeah, I know,
let me just put on my "ice knives".

08:09.030 --> 08:10.198
I--I mean, condom.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.575
The brand is Ice Knives.
They're the biggest.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.161
-Okay, here we go.

08:15.244 --> 08:17.830
That's right,
my little vodka potato.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.416
-Let's chicken his Kiev.
-Whoaâ¦

08:20.500 --> 08:22.543
Yeah. Okay, I can do this.

08:22.627 --> 08:27.006
-Ladies and gentlemen, let's fuck Leah!

08:27.089 --> 08:27.924
Whoa!

08:28.007 --> 08:29.175
-Now, where do I--
-Not there.

08:29.258 --> 08:31.636
-There, is that it?
-Nope, excuse me, that's private.

08:31.719 --> 08:33.971
-Okay, that hurts a littleâ¦
-Â¿DÃ³nde estÃ¡ la biblioteca?

08:34.055 --> 08:35.181
Oh! You're in.

08:35.264 --> 08:37.225
We should start with simple move.

08:37.308 --> 08:40.019
Make trip around rink, wave to judges.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.939
-Careful!
-Yeah! You like that?

08:43.022 --> 08:45.900
Um, yeah, it's okay.

08:45.983 --> 08:48.736
We try new position. Go for the lift!

08:48.819 --> 08:50.905
-I'm about to have a miracle on ice!
-Ah!

08:50.988 --> 08:54.867
Wow, that was amazing.
Right, babe?

08:54.951 --> 08:58.120
Yeah, totally amazing, babe.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.790
Liar! That was not amazing.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.668
It was pokey and fast and chaos.

09:03.751 --> 09:04.585
I know!

09:04.669 --> 09:08.923
He promised you a happy cry,
but left you feeling crappy and dry.

09:09.006 --> 09:11.842
I'm gonna go check movie times
in the bathroom.

09:11.926 --> 09:15.012
Thanks for letting Jay stay here
while he gets over his girlfriend.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.264
Oh, that poor baby.

09:16.347 --> 09:19.350
I heard that Skumpy girl
absolutely annihilated him.

09:19.433 --> 09:20.810
Who did you hear that from?

09:20.893 --> 09:23.729
Her! She's going door-to-door
telling everybody.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.274
It's all anyone my age group
is talking about.

09:26.357 --> 09:29.026
I-- Oh, and there he is now!

09:29.110 --> 09:32.822
Look at you. You look like
a chipmunk going to a job interview.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.824
Thanks, Mr. Matthew.

09:34.907 --> 09:37.618
So, Jay, my son tells me you do magic.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.745
Why don't you do a trick for us, Jay?

09:39.829 --> 09:41.789
Oh, I wish I could, Mrs. Matthew,

09:41.872 --> 09:45.668
but I'm nothing now,
and I'm just waiting to die. Ta-da!

09:45.751 --> 09:47.587
Oh, Maury, this is not hot.

09:47.670 --> 09:51.299
Yeah, and he's all cleaned up
like some Matthew-ass bitch.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.050
No offense, buddy, it works for you.

09:53.134 --> 09:53.968
Oh, no, I get it.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.096
Elliot, I'm gonna ride with Leah

09:57.179 --> 09:59.682
because I could use
a little space from you right now.

10:00.683 --> 10:02.143
Val, you're dating Diane's daughter,

10:02.226 --> 10:04.186
do you think you could
put in a good word for me?

10:04.270 --> 10:08.524
Okay, these seats are moving pretty fast.
Should we ask someone to slow them down?

10:08.608 --> 10:10.526
Come on! Get on the fucking chair!

10:10.610 --> 10:13.487
Sir! If you rush me,
it will only take longer.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.364
-Andrew, just go!
-Ah!

10:15.448 --> 10:17.074
Why are you so mad at Dad?

10:17.158 --> 10:20.828
I just don't like that he gave
you and Val your own room, okay?

10:20.911 --> 10:23.706
Oh, my God! I knew all that stuff
about how you'd rather

10:23.789 --> 10:26.709
I "do it under your roof"
was total bullshit!

10:26.792 --> 10:29.128
It wasn't, and I would, I--I think.

10:29.211 --> 10:30.296
I don't know.

10:30.379 --> 10:32.757
And I'm having trouble
with it, okay, Leah?

10:32.840 --> 10:36.427
Kinda like how Val was having trouble
holding onto his yogurt!

10:36.510 --> 10:40.598
And if it makes you feel any better,
I feel bad about feeling bad about it.

10:40.681 --> 10:43.392
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
it totally sucked.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.186
And I don't even think
I want to do it again.

10:45.269 --> 10:48.648
No! That does not make me feel better,
that's awful!

10:48.731 --> 10:51.108
You're my daughter,
and if you're going to have sex,

10:51.192 --> 10:54.445
I want you to have
wonderful, satisfying sex.

10:54.528 --> 10:56.113
Ew! Mom! Don't say that!

10:56.197 --> 10:57.948
You guys are teenagers.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.116
You're just learning,

10:59.200 --> 11:02.828
and you need to be able
to tell your partner what arouses you.

11:02.912 --> 11:03.996
"Arouses"?

11:04.080 --> 11:07.416
Maybe you'll like nipple play,
or mutual masturbation.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.294
Or having your toes counted out loud!

11:10.378 --> 11:12.588
Mom, I beg you, please stop!

11:12.672 --> 11:14.840
Well, if you're not ready
to talk about sex,

11:14.924 --> 11:17.051
then maybe
you're not ready to be having it.

11:17.134 --> 11:19.470
Okay, well,
now you have to have sex again,

11:19.553 --> 11:21.263
just to prove your mom wrong!

11:21.347 --> 11:22.515
That's hot, right?

11:22.598 --> 11:25.976
Hey, Nick, let's take a selfie
and hashtag it "Dat Birch life."

11:26.060 --> 11:30.314
-More like, "Dat bitch life."
-Oh, no, my wallet! My white wallet!

11:30.398 --> 11:31.857
Nick, remember where it was.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.359
Oh, we're dropping things?

11:33.442 --> 11:36.112
Okay. Later, loser!

11:36.195 --> 11:38.614
Maybe I should
just jump and disappear

11:38.698 --> 11:40.616
into the snow like a white wallet.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.035
Why does your wife
being mad at you make you so sad?

11:43.119 --> 11:45.621
It's not like your ATV got stolen
or something.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.832
But my ATV was taken away,

11:47.915 --> 11:51.627
because for me,
ATV stands for "Adore The Vagina."

11:51.711 --> 11:54.547
Oh, yeah!
The vagina is kind of like a door.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.006
You can go in and you can go out.

11:56.090 --> 11:59.510
And the clitoris is the doorbell.
Ding-dong! I love you!

11:59.593 --> 12:01.303
The clitoris? I hear that's a myth.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.389
Oh, yes. I've seen
your father's law commercials,

12:03.472 --> 12:05.391
but it's very real and very important.

12:05.474 --> 12:07.435
Really? I had no idea.

12:07.518 --> 12:10.146
You don't know how
to ring my daughter's doorbell? Oh, Val.

12:10.229 --> 12:12.940
Sex should be
a mutually pleasurable activity.

12:13.023 --> 12:15.985
It was pleasurable.
I mean, I had fun. I think she did.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.737
I don't know if she did.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.614
I don't know if I had a good time.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.074
It--it was bad?

12:22.158 --> 12:25.911
Well, maybe you should try
listening to your lover, my daughter,

12:25.995 --> 12:28.080
and figure out how to ATV.

12:28.164 --> 12:31.709
Yeah. And I don't know,
maybe you should try listening to Diane.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.169
Val, you're a very sweet boy,

12:33.252 --> 12:36.172
but keep my wife's name
out of your fucking mouth.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.090
Okay, tips up. Here we are!

12:39.842 --> 12:42.344
Whoa, whoa.
Nicky, where do you think you're going?

12:42.428 --> 12:44.764
I'm doing the Organgrinder
with Val and Leah.

12:44.847 --> 12:49.351
-Uh, the Organgrinder is a black diamond!
-I don't think you're ready for that.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.978
-What?
-And what about Andrew?

12:51.061 --> 12:52.480
Can you ski a black diamond?

12:52.563 --> 12:55.232
I'm sorry.
I thought the chair thing was the ride.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.318
Full disclosure, I have never skied.

12:57.401 --> 12:59.904
Ooh, a black diamond
is the most advanced run.

12:59.987 --> 13:03.949
As long as there are no humps
and I can sit down, I should be okay.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.409
Nick, you stay with Andrew.

13:05.493 --> 13:08.037
-Make sure he gets down safely.
-Mom! Mom, please.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.998
-You guys should try the cuddly duckling.

13:11.081 --> 13:11.999
Bye, Mrs. Birch!

13:12.082 --> 13:12.917
Jesus!

13:13.000 --> 13:15.002
-You tag along on my family ski tripâ¦
-That's it!

13:15.085 --> 13:17.004
â¦you ride with us
to the top of a mountainâ¦

13:17.087 --> 13:18.088
It's too much!

13:18.172 --> 13:19.882
And now you can't even ski?

13:19.965 --> 13:22.760
I can't anymore with this tube sock.
I can't!

13:22.843 --> 13:24.595
Fuck you, Andrew!

13:24.678 --> 13:27.014
Wow, dick move. Got to admire it.

13:27.097 --> 13:29.141
You know what, Maury? I can do this.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.060
Andrew, I gotta level with you, bud.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.228
You are out of shape.

13:32.311 --> 13:35.731
You struggle with stairs,
and you have a hard time pouring milk.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.441
You're going to kill yourself.

13:37.525 --> 13:40.945
You're right.
Andrew Glouberman would kill himself.

13:41.028 --> 13:44.490
But Andrew Birch
is gonna shralp this pow-pow.

13:44.573 --> 13:46.617
I'm on my butt.Â I'm on my butt.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.702
Oh, no! Here comes the tree.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.287
Still approaching.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.373
-Ow!
-Hey, are you okay?

13:52.456 --> 13:54.667
No. I shouldn't even be up here.

13:54.750 --> 13:57.878
Me neither. My mom was right.
I'm gonna break my neckâ¦

13:57.962 --> 14:00.714
Like a Kennedy
because their family was cursed.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.299
-That's what I was gonna say.
-Jinx!

14:02.383 --> 14:04.051
-Hi, I'm Bernadette.
-Hi!

14:04.134 --> 14:06.846
Bernadette Sanders.
But everyone just calls me Bernie.

14:06.929 --> 14:07.930
Wow!

14:08.013 --> 14:09.098
-I'm--
-Andrew?

14:09.181 --> 14:10.599
-Yeah!
-Cute picture, by the way.

14:10.683 --> 14:14.520
Oh, my God, you found my wallet
that's the same color as the snow!

14:14.603 --> 14:17.398
Yeah, I tripped on it,
and it got lodged in my crevasse.

14:17.481 --> 14:19.233
Smell it, smell the fucking wallet.

14:19.316 --> 14:22.236
I'm so grateful
that you were able to find it andâ¦

14:22.319 --> 14:24.405
No, it still smells like my ass.

14:24.488 --> 14:25.823
Ask if she'll put it back up.

14:25.906 --> 14:28.951
Well, here's a thought
from the ol' idea factory.

14:29.034 --> 14:32.037
What if we go down the mountain
on our crevasses together?

14:32.121 --> 14:35.708
Bernie Sanders,
nothing would make me feel less alone.

14:35.791 --> 14:38.794
-Oh!
-Oh! I went over a pine cone!

14:39.545 --> 14:42.840
I can't believe they wouldn't let me
go down the Organgrinder.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.508
My rights are being trampled.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.427
And I didn't want to be
the one to tell you,

14:46.510 --> 14:48.888
but there are actual mountains out west.

14:48.971 --> 14:53.017
What you're skiing on here
is a hill of icy dog shit.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.311
Oh, have you
ever seen Nights inÂ Rodanthe?

14:55.394 --> 14:57.521
-Well, of course.
-I'm a huge Richard Gere fan.

14:57.605 --> 15:01.317
Get out of here. You're a Gere head?
I'm a huge Diane Laniac.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.485
Well, sure. She's a piece of candy.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.446
What in the actual fuck?

15:05.529 --> 15:06.989
Nick! This is Bernie!

15:07.072 --> 15:09.867
Hi, Nick! I'd get up and shake your hand,
but I'm holding in a fart.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.328
Hey, also that sign
above the hot tub that says,

15:12.411 --> 15:15.748
"Don't go in if you've had
diarrhea in the last 48 hours,"

15:15.831 --> 15:17.416
that's not, like, a law, right?

15:17.499 --> 15:20.836
It can't be. Who's ever gone
48 hours without having diarrhea?

15:20.920 --> 15:21.795
Not me!

15:21.879 --> 15:22.796
Jinx!

15:22.880 --> 15:24.715
Andrew found a snow bunny?

15:24.798 --> 15:28.010
Andrew? This trip is fucking trash.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.470
Come on in, Nick, join us!

15:29.553 --> 15:31.430
Yeah, I was just kidding about the fart.

15:31.513 --> 15:32.973
I let it out a long time ago.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.642
I wasn't gonna let it boil in here.

15:34.725 --> 15:37.937
I think I'll just go stand barefoot
in the snow, but thanks.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.605
Oh, hello, Bonstance.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.690
Actually, it's Bonrad.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.360
And if you're using the hot tub,
I can come back.

15:44.443 --> 15:46.820
Oh, come on. There's plenty of room.

15:46.904 --> 15:50.616
It'll just be you, me,
and these two fucking Garbage Pail Kids.

15:50.699 --> 15:53.827
Well, I do love a juicy jacuzzi.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.871
Just like your sister
and her bubble baths.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.290
Bubble baths are for gettin' clean.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.751
Hot tubs are for gettin' dirty!

16:00.834 --> 16:04.672
Holy shit, my boiled dick
is so hard right now.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.677
Val, I would like to buy
the electric company

16:09.760 --> 16:12.346
because things need to get turned on.

16:12.429 --> 16:16.392
Well, if that would give you pleasure,
then I am ATV.

16:16.475 --> 16:20.437
-I bet that filthyÂ Bilzerian has HPV.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.022
Just give me the stupid dice.

16:22.106 --> 16:24.608
-Oh! Marvin Gardens!
-Yeah!

16:24.692 --> 16:27.778
Uh-oh, Bernie and I own
a big, fat hotel there.

16:27.861 --> 16:29.780
-Like your fat juicy butt!

16:29.863 --> 16:31.573
-Bernie, stop it!
-No, I won't!

16:31.657 --> 16:34.743
Oh, my God, both of you stop it! What theâ¦

16:34.827 --> 16:37.246
Welcome to the Hotel Di'Aray-a.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.873
-Where you pay out the ass.

16:39.957 --> 16:40.916
-Hey, Nick!
-Shit.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.877
-Check it out! I'm inside your sister!

16:43.961 --> 16:46.714
Thanks, Mom and Dad,
for making this so easy!

16:46.797 --> 16:48.215
-No!
-If our children aren't fucking,

16:48.298 --> 16:49.341
we're not proud of them!

16:49.425 --> 16:51.510
-Nicky, why don't you have a lover?
-What?

16:51.593 --> 16:55.639
You're all alone, and this game is gonna
last another two and a half hours!

16:55.723 --> 16:56.765
-Fire!

16:56.849 --> 16:58.183
Fuck you all!

16:58.267 --> 16:59.852
I don't want to play anymore!

16:59.935 --> 17:01.729
Nicholas! What is wrong with you?

17:01.812 --> 17:03.605
Me? What's wrong with you?

17:03.689 --> 17:07.109
You're just gonna
let this sleazy putz fuck our Leah?

17:07.192 --> 17:08.277
-Oh, my God!
-Yes.

17:08.360 --> 17:11.488
We are gonna let Val fuck our Leah,
and Leah fuck our Val,

17:11.572 --> 17:13.073
because that is who we are.

17:13.157 --> 17:15.617
Elliot! Do you even hear yourself?

17:15.701 --> 17:16.827
Nick, sit down.

17:16.910 --> 17:17.995
Have some Havarti.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.122
Have a couple olives and relax.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.875
We're the Birches.
We're sexually progressive.

17:22.958 --> 17:25.085
-Well, I'm sexually aggressive.

17:25.169 --> 17:27.212
-Let me goosey that juicyÂ caboosey.
-Oh!

17:27.296 --> 17:29.256
Why are you here? Who even are you?

17:29.339 --> 17:31.550
I'm Bernie Sanders. Get on board!

17:31.633 --> 17:32.676
I hate all of you!

17:32.760 --> 17:34.762
You're such a spoiled little baby!

17:34.845 --> 17:37.014
I am not spoiled!

17:37.097 --> 17:40.559
Fuck my family. Fuck Andrew.
Fuck Bernie Sanders!

17:40.642 --> 17:43.854
You need to show those cum junkies
you are not a baby.

17:43.937 --> 17:45.522
Yeah! How--how do I do that?

17:45.606 --> 17:47.524
-What do big boys do?

17:47.608 --> 17:50.402
They fucking shred the black diamond!

17:50.486 --> 17:51.695
Oh, hell yes.

17:51.779 --> 17:55.866
Big boys also tie their own shoes
and hold their sippy cups

17:55.949 --> 17:57.868
all by theirÂ own selves.

17:57.951 --> 17:58.952
All right.

17:59.036 --> 18:01.580
Well, you probably want me to get lost.

18:01.663 --> 18:03.957
I'd disappear,
but I don't know if you've heard,

18:04.041 --> 18:05.542
I can't do magic anymore.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.044
Yeah, I got that.

18:07.127 --> 18:09.588
Matthew, if you let him go, I quit.

18:09.671 --> 18:11.965
-Are you allowed to do that?
-Fucking try me.

18:12.049 --> 18:14.843
You know, Jay,
you don't have to leave.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.845
Why are you being so nice to me?

18:16.929 --> 18:19.264
Everybody's right, I'm a fucking loser.

18:19.348 --> 18:22.684
Well, yeah, right now
your whole vibe kind of sucks.

18:22.768 --> 18:23.727
See, you get it.

18:23.811 --> 18:25.562
-But this isn't you.
-Isn't it?

18:25.646 --> 18:27.356
You're confident and tough.

18:27.439 --> 18:31.026
I mean, life shits all over you
like you're a statue at a bird sanctuary,

18:31.110 --> 18:32.236
but you're Jay.

18:32.319 --> 18:35.405
-You just keep going.
-Yeah, he does. He's the best of us.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.241
And meanwhile, I'm such a coward,

18:37.324 --> 18:40.077
I couldn't even tell my boyfriend
why I really broke up with him.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.412
Oh, yeah, that was so stupid.

18:42.496 --> 18:43.664
Aiden was perfect.

18:43.747 --> 18:45.541
I know, but heâ¦

18:47.334 --> 18:49.336
Jay, he wasn't you.

18:49.419 --> 18:52.756
Wait, what?
Why are you saying all this shit?

18:52.840 --> 18:56.552
I'm dumb. I'm rude.
My dick looks like a bruised yam.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.846
Because I like you, okay?

18:58.929 --> 19:00.222
There, I fucking said it.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.057
I, like, like-like you.

19:02.141 --> 19:06.436
-Oh, me, oh, my. I hope he likes us back.
-Hey, are you fucking with me right now?

19:06.520 --> 19:07.980
Do not fuck with me, Matthew.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.106
You don't like me.

19:09.189 --> 19:12.734
I do! It's crazy,
but I really, really like you.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.778
-I like that you're unhinged.
-Yeah!

19:14.862 --> 19:16.363
-Unwashed.
-So dirty.

19:16.446 --> 19:18.240
-Uncut.
-Uh-huh.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.700
You're fucking right I am.

19:19.783 --> 19:23.996
And, Jay, you've got that funk
that makes my junk wanna spunk.

19:24.079 --> 19:25.914
Hey, you used my line!

19:25.998 --> 19:28.584
Ooh, quick consent
to mash your mouth with mine?

19:28.667 --> 19:30.669
Consent granted, sailor.

19:32.379 --> 19:36.133
Oh, finally. Reality matches my tattoo.

19:36.216 --> 19:39.386
When I clenchâ¦

19:39.469 --> 19:45.267
So Valtrex Giuliani Bilzerian,
what, uh, arouses you?

19:45.350 --> 19:48.187
-Uhâ¦
-I mean, what turns you on?

19:48.270 --> 19:49.730
Oh, you know, just regular stuff.

19:49.813 --> 19:52.858
Stepsister stuff,
stepmom stuff, stepfather stuff.

19:52.941 --> 19:56.195
But what I'd be into right now
is "pleasuring you" stuff.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.655
-So what are you into?
-What do I say?

19:58.739 --> 20:01.575
Speak from the heart, about your pussy.

20:01.658 --> 20:03.118
So I just say it?

20:03.202 --> 20:05.037
A closed mouth don't get fed,

20:05.120 --> 20:07.206
and a closed pussy don't get licked.

20:07.289 --> 20:10.876
Um, I think what I would like
is for you to go down on me.

20:10.959 --> 20:14.129
Okay, I can do this.
I'm ready. But just a heads-up,

20:14.213 --> 20:17.883
I'm not sure I can "adore the vagina"
as good as your dad does.

20:17.966 --> 20:21.637
Hey, Val? Keep my father's name
out of your fucking mouth.

20:21.720 --> 20:22.554
Mmm.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.097
Quite the view, huh?

20:24.181 --> 20:27.935
So we're on a bed
in the midst of a rare diarrhea pause.

20:28.018 --> 20:29.853
What do you want to do?

20:29.937 --> 20:32.606
-Maury, what do I want to do?
-Uh, let me think.

20:32.689 --> 20:34.775
Tell herâ¦ Oh, God, I don't know.

20:34.858 --> 20:39.238
Uh, kissy. Ki-kissy touchy.
Oh, shit! Uh, kissy touchy wee-wee?

20:39.321 --> 20:42.532
Well, what would you like to do, Bernie?

20:42.616 --> 20:44.660
I think I would like you to kiss me?

20:44.743 --> 20:46.870
Oh, kissy touchy wee-wee!

20:46.954 --> 20:48.288
-Mmm.

20:48.372 --> 20:51.583
Ooh! I like that your mustache
smells like mustard.

20:51.667 --> 20:55.921
Oh, my boys are
fucking crushing it this episode.

20:56.004 --> 20:59.299
Okay.
Now that you've Zambonied the ice,

20:59.383 --> 21:00.926
should we try skating again?

21:01.009 --> 21:03.762
Wait, babe, since we're,
like, talking now and stuff,

21:03.845 --> 21:05.597
I should tell you that last night,

21:05.681 --> 21:07.099
it was my first time.

21:07.182 --> 21:09.601
-Oh! I'm so lame.
-Aww. No.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.354
I think it's nice
that it was both of our first times.

21:12.437 --> 21:16.024
Aw, that's very sweet, but chop-chop,
kissy touchy wee-wee! Come on.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.652
-Okay, how's that?
-Good. We can go a little faster.

21:18.735 --> 21:22.072
-Really? Oh, does that feel okay?
-Mmm. Yeah. It feels kind of great.

21:22.155 --> 21:24.241
-I know!
-Hey, do you know how to skate backwards?

21:24.324 --> 21:26.285
Actually, I think
we might need to go for the jump.

21:26.368 --> 21:29.079
Already?
That's okay. Let's do it.

21:30.872 --> 21:33.458
-That was kind of okay.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.919
Fuck yeah! It was kinda okay!

21:36.003 --> 21:38.463
Yeah! Like pancakes without syrup.

21:38.547 --> 21:40.048
It was kind of okay!

21:40.132 --> 21:42.467
-You wanna try again?
-I think I do.

21:42.551 --> 21:43.844
Yeah, let's go!

21:43.927 --> 21:47.306
Let's get some lady nectar
up on those flapjacks.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.182
Okay, I get it. I've heard you.

21:49.266 --> 21:52.019
You don't love me anymore.
You want a divorce? That's fine.

21:52.102 --> 21:55.022
All I ask is 100% custody of you.

21:55.105 --> 21:57.357
I don't want a divorce, Elliot,

21:57.441 --> 22:00.944
I just want to have a real conversation
about our daughter having sex!

22:01.028 --> 22:03.780
-Oh, you want a real conversation, do you?
-Yes, I do!

22:03.864 --> 22:05.073
Well, here's what I think!

22:05.157 --> 22:07.993
Leah's ready to have sex when
Leah says she's ready to have sex

22:08.076 --> 22:11.163
because we made Leah ready
to have sex when Leah's ready to have sex.

22:11.246 --> 22:13.999
I know, but you need
to let me have my feelings about it!

22:14.082 --> 22:17.127
I'm yelling,
but I'm actually very sorry about that,

22:17.210 --> 22:19.463
and honestly,
I'm a little nervous about itÂ too!

22:19.546 --> 22:22.341
How would I know that
if we don't talk about it?

22:22.424 --> 22:25.594
Oh, God, it feels like
just yesterday she was five years old,

22:25.677 --> 22:30.098
and we were explaining that what she was
calling her vagina was actually her vulva.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.850
-I know it's hard,

22:31.933 --> 22:35.937
but do you know how sexy
you are when you're honest with me?

22:36.021 --> 22:37.022
I am?

22:37.105 --> 22:39.483
Can I please adore the vagina now?

22:39.566 --> 22:42.694
No, because I'm gonna ATP.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.571
You mean, adore the penis?

22:44.654 --> 22:46.323
No. Annihilate it!

22:47.574 --> 22:49.326
-Whew!

22:49.409 --> 22:51.661
It is hot under the Tuscan sun.

22:51.745 --> 22:54.581
I know, I'm schvitzing
through my prescription deodorant.

22:54.664 --> 22:57.334
Should we, uh, take off our shirts?

22:57.417 --> 22:59.878
Oh, my God, this is it!

22:59.961 --> 23:01.922
It's time to feel the Bern!

23:02.005 --> 23:02.923
Hey, Mauryâ¦

23:03.006 --> 23:05.592
My sister and I have decided two things.

23:05.675 --> 23:08.220
One, it's time to put our dad in a home.

23:08.303 --> 23:10.889
And two, we're having a threesome.

23:10.972 --> 23:14.017
Well, I think, uh,
both of those things are for the best.

23:15.352 --> 23:17.396
Do you guys have
a place in mind for your dad,

23:17.479 --> 23:19.106
or you just gonna start researching?

23:19.189 --> 23:20.649
Yeah, put a finger in my fucking ass.

23:21.149 --> 23:23.276
Those assholes!
They can't tell me what to do.

23:23.360 --> 23:26.113
Damn straight!
Let's hate fuck this mountain.

23:26.196 --> 23:27.030
Fuck yeah!

23:27.114 --> 23:29.366
-Whoa! Ooh!

23:29.449 --> 23:30.534
Oh!

23:30.617 --> 23:32.452
Later, losers!

23:34.996 --> 23:36.998
Oh, my God!

23:37.082 --> 23:38.667
I never tried ceviche,

23:38.750 --> 23:42.170
-even though I told everyone I hated it!

23:43.797 --> 23:45.298
Ow! My leg!

23:45.382 --> 23:47.467
I hate skiing!

23:47.551 --> 23:49.344
I hate Mondays!

23:49.428 --> 23:53.140
I hate my fucking life!

23:53.223 --> 23:55.725
-But I love lasagna!

23:55.809 --> 23:57.853
-I love being pleasured!

23:57.936 --> 24:01.523
I'm having sex
for the third time in 12 hours!

24:01.606 --> 24:04.192
I'm about to touch boobs!

24:04.276 --> 24:06.236
I'm also about to touch boobs!

24:06.319 --> 24:08.405
-And I'm about to put the mayo

24:08.488 --> 24:10.323
in aÂ LaCienega sandwich.

24:10.407 --> 24:11.950
Yum, yum!

24:16.288 --> 24:17.789
-Oh, shit!

24:17.873 --> 24:18.999
Whoa!

24:19.082 --> 24:21.126
-No!

24:21.209 --> 24:23.420
-Bernie, are you there?

24:23.503 --> 24:25.005
Should we still keep making out?

24:25.088 --> 24:27.048
-I want to touch your boob.
-Connie?

24:27.132 --> 24:28.091
-Bonnie?

24:28.175 --> 24:30.302
Are you sixty-nining
each other under there?

24:31.553 --> 24:34.473
-Judd, you saved my life.

24:34.556 --> 24:37.601
-You die when I say you die.
-Ooph!

24:38.894 --> 24:41.938
Well, Nicky,
you broke your leg and our trust.

24:42.022 --> 24:43.440
It wasn't my fault!

24:43.523 --> 24:44.816
What were you thinking?

24:44.900 --> 24:47.861
-It wasn't my fault!
-Yeah, it was. I saw the whole thing.

24:47.944 --> 24:48.945
He cursed us all

24:49.029 --> 24:50.822
-and then cried like a little bitch.

24:50.906 --> 24:54.451
I have to go.
My mom's freaking out about the avalanche,

24:54.534 --> 24:57.037
and my dad's big balls
got caught in his zipper.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.206
Wait, will I see you tomorrow?

24:59.289 --> 25:01.541
I'm sorry, Andrew,
we have to get Nicky back to Bridgeton.

25:01.625 --> 25:02.959
-He needs surgery.
-No, no, no.

25:03.043 --> 25:05.295
You take the boy. I stay here with Bernie.

25:05.378 --> 25:08.882
I will make my way back to New York
by following the sun in reverse.

25:08.965 --> 25:10.634
-Now go!
-Goodbye, Andrew.

25:10.717 --> 25:12.552
-Goodbye, Bernie Sanders.

25:12.636 --> 25:14.971
Maybe we could try again in four years.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.057
I don't know. I'll be pretty old.

25:17.599 --> 25:19.059
Well, I hope you're happy, Nick.

25:19.142 --> 25:21.436
Your selfishness
ruined our family vacation.

25:21.520 --> 25:25.649
Ugh! And you know Mom and Dad aren't gonna
let Val sleep in my room at home, fucker!

25:25.732 --> 25:28.151
-I was going to touch boobs, young man.

25:28.235 --> 25:31.029
Boobs. On a girl.
And she was gonna touch mine!

25:31.112 --> 25:32.906
All of you stop talking!

25:32.989 --> 25:36.243
I'm gonna get you for this,
Nick, if it's the last thing I do.

25:36.326 --> 25:38.453
Well, it probably
won't be the last thing I do.

25:38.537 --> 25:39.913
I'll probably smoke crack.

25:39.996 --> 25:42.123
Why did you make me go down that mountain?

25:42.207 --> 25:44.668
Oh, please. I didn't make you do shit.

25:44.751 --> 25:46.127
I hate you, Walter!

25:46.211 --> 25:49.256
Bitch! I hated you first!
