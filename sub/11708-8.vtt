10:32.923 --> 10:36.218
- YO, THIS AIN'T HAPPENING.
GUIDOS AIN'T MADE TO FISH.

10:36.302 --> 10:39.096
I CAN FISH FOR GIRLS
BUT NOT FUCKING FOR FISH.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.514
I'M REALIZING
THAT I'M NOT THE BEST CRABBER.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.767
I'M NOT
THE BEST FISHERMAN.

10:42.850 --> 10:45.269
BUT I AM STILL A GUIDO,
AND I NEED TO TAN,

10:45.353 --> 10:49.023
SO I'M JUST GONNA SUNBATHE

10:49.106 --> 10:51.484

10:51.567 --> 10:53.444
WHAT THE HELL?

10:53.527 --> 10:54.570

SPREAD-EAGLE RIGHT NOW

10:54.653 --> 10:57.615
IN ONE

10:57.698 --> 11:02.078
AND HE'S ASKING
FOR SOME TROUBLE RIGHT NOW.

11:06.999 --> 11:11.504
- OH, SHIT!

11:11.587 --> 11:13.255
- NOT COOL, BRO.

11:13.339 --> 11:17.426
NOT COOL.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.595
- I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANY FISH OVER HERE.

11:19.678 --> 11:20.638
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS
LIKE MY RELATIONSHIPS--

11:20.721 --> 11:22.598
NOT ONE PERSON
WANTS TO GRAB MY BAIT.

11:22.681 --> 11:24.975
DO YOU WANT TO GO
ON THE BOAT?

11:25.059 --> 11:26.435
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.854
SO ME AND NICOLE DECIDE TO TAKE
A BOAT OUT ON THE WATER,

11:28.938 --> 11:31.941
BECAUSE WE'RE LIKE,
"THIS WOULD BE AWESOME.

11:32.024 --> 11:35.611
WE COULD ROW AND FISH
AT THE SAME TIME."

11:39.865 --> 11:42.243
- WHOA!
DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

11:42.326 --> 11:44.662
YOU GOT IT?

11:50.584 --> 11:53.254
WHOA! OH!

11:53.337 --> 11:54.463
I GOT YOU.
I GOT YOU.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.966
- THE MEATBALLS DECIDE
TO TAKE OUT THIS BOAT.

11:57.049 --> 12:00.469
- THAT'S GOOD.
- I GOT IT.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.638
- BUT IT'S SO WINDY OUT,

12:02.721 --> 12:04.306
I DON'T KNOW
HOW THEY'RE GONNA MAKE IT

12:04.390 --> 12:05.141
THROUGH THE WAVES
OR ANYTHING.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.143
- WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.228
- YOU HAVE
TO FUCKING PADDLE.

12:09.311 --> 12:11.480
YEAH, THERE YOU GO.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.607
- ONE, TWO, THREE, ROW.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.192
- THEY'RE GOING
AGAINST EACH OTHER RIGHT NOW.

12:15.276 --> 12:16.610
THEY'RE DOING,
LIKE, A CIRCLE.

12:16.694 --> 12:17.987
- ROW!
- WHOO!

12:18.070 --> 12:19.655
FUCKING IDIOT, YOU ALMOST TOOK
MY FINGER OFF.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.907
- I DIDN'T DO IT.
IT WAS THE WIND.

12:21.991 --> 12:25.202
- YOU GUYS HAVE TO PADDLE
IN SYNC...

12:25.286 --> 12:26.704
NOT THE OPPOSITE WAYS.

12:26.787 --> 12:30.166
- IT'S SO WINDY OUT RIGHT NOW,
AND THE BOAT IS, YOU KNOW,

12:30.249 --> 12:32.543
GOING ALL OVER THE PLACE.

12:32.626 --> 12:35.171
AND I FEEL LIKE THE CURRENT
IS CARRYING ME AND NICOLE AWAY.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.631
[laughter]
AND I'M LIKE, "OH, MY GOD,

12:37.715 --> 12:38.841
"LIKE, LET'S FRICKIN' TRY

12:38.924 --> 12:39.508
AND ROW OURSELVES
TO, LIKE, A DOCK."

12:39.592 --> 12:43.179
- ROW!
ROW!

12:43.262 --> 12:46.015
- WOW.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.141
- YO, WATCH YOUR HEADS.

12:47.224 --> 12:50.895
- [screaming]
- WATCH YOUR HEADS.

12:50.978 --> 12:54.398
- THE MEATBALLS HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THEY'RE DOING RIGHT NOW,

12:54.482 --> 12:56.400
AND SO MYSELF AND RON--

12:56.484 --> 12:58.277
YOU KNOW, WE GOTTA BE
THE RESPONSIBLE ONES

12:58.360 --> 13:00.196
AND PULL THE PLUG
ON THIS.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.238
- YOU GUYS GOT IT?
- YEAH, WE GOT IT.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.449
- WE'RE GOOD.

13:03.532 --> 13:04.492
- YO, YOU'RE MAKING IT WORSE,
I FEEL.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.577
- NO.

13:06.660 --> 13:07.912
- NO.
- GET OFF. STOP IT.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.580
- GET OFF, RONNIE.

13:14.835 --> 13:15.503
STOP. WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE
A GOOD TIME HERE.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.713
- STOP IT!
- NO.

13:17.796 --> 13:19.298
I WANT TO SEE IF I CAN ROW.
- GET OFF.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.175
NO, I'M NOT EVEN WEARING
A BIKINI.

13:21.258 --> 13:22.968
- SO I LET THE AIR
OUT OF THE BOAT.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.303
ARMS ARE FLAPPING
IN THE AIR.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.514
THERE'S MEATBALL SAUCE
FLYING EVERYWHERE.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.224
- [shrieks]

13:28.307 --> 13:31.185
THIS BOAT IS SINKING,
AND I'VE SEEN <i> TITANIC.</i>

13:31.268 --> 13:34.021
AND THIS IS NOT
GOING TO END WELL.

13:34.104 --> 13:35.898
- OH, WATCH OUT.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.859

WATCH OUT, DEENA.
DEENA.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.872
- SO WE'RE ALL SCREAMING,
"IT'S SHARP! IT'S SHARP!

13:51.956 --> 13:53.374
LIKE, STOP DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,"

13:53.457 --> 13:55.167
'CAUSE THERE ARE SHARP OBJECTS
WHERE THEY ARE.

13:55.251 --> 13:58.003
AND D THINKS WE'RE SAYING,
"THERE'S A SHARK!"

13:58.087 --> 14:00.256

YOU CAN'T JUMP ON THAT.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.132
DEENA, DEENA, DEENA, YOU CAN'T--
THAT'S TOO SHARP.

14:02.216 --> 14:06.095

14:11.684 --> 14:14.853
STAY AWAY FROM THAT.
STAY ON THE BOAT.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.106
THE BOAT IS THE SAFEST THING.
- OH, MY GOD.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.566
- WHAT THE HELL?

14:18.649 --> 14:19.692
- I'M SOAKED.
- YOU GOTTA STAY ON THE BOAT.

14:19.775 --> 14:23.279
STAY ON THE BOAT.

SAVE HER.

14:25.906 --> 14:28.325
- [laughs]
- I'M STUCK.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.578
- DEENA'S LITERALLY TRYING TO
GET OUT OF THREE FEET OF WATER

14:30.661 --> 14:31.954
BECAUSE THERE'S SHARKS IN IT,

14:32.037 --> 14:35.124
AND NICOLE IS JUST WORRIED
ABOUT HER ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE

14:35.207 --> 14:37.126
FLOATING AWAY.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.128
IT WAS LEGIT, COMPLETE CHAOS.

14:39.211 --> 14:42.047
- YEAH, THERE'S SNOOKIS
ALL THROUGH THESE WATERS.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.716
[laughs]

14:43.799 --> 14:45.426
YO, YOU KNOW
HOW YOU CATCH A SNOOKI?

14:45.509 --> 14:49.888
PICKLES.
[laughs]

14:49.972 --> 14:51.348
- MY EYELASH FELL OFF.

14:51.432 --> 14:54.476
- YOUR EYELASH IS FLOATING
IN THE PACIFIC AS WE SPEAK.

14:54.560 --> 14:58.439
LUCKILY, SHARKS SEEM
TO NOT LIKE MEATBALLS.

14:58.522 --> 15:00.691
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
NONE OF US WERE CAPABLE

15:00.774 --> 15:01.817
OF REALLY CATCHING ANY FISH
AND CRABS.

15:01.900 --> 15:05.988
SO WE'RE GETTING
CHINESE FOOD.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.324
- UGH, I NEED TO SHOWER.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.159
-<i> YOU</i> HAVE TO SHOWER?

15:10.242 --> 15:13.329
- UGH, THE CAR SMELLS
LIKE THAT SMUSH ROOM.

15:13.412 --> 15:16.999
[all chuckle]

15:17.082 --> 15:18.667
- YOUR STALKER CAME IN
YESTERDAY.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.461
- I'M AFRAID OF THIS GIRL,
'CAUSE EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND,

15:20.544 --> 15:21.962
SHE'S THERE.
- OH, MY GOD.

15:22.046 --> 15:23.714
- WE'RE GONNA BE LIKE,
"WHERE'S PAULY?"

15:23.797 --> 15:26.508
- [laughs] YEAH.

15:26.592 --> 15:27.551
- WAIT. HOLD ON.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.470

COMING AT US,

15:29.553 --> 15:33.098
AND I'M LIKE, "OH, MY GOD."
IT'S THE FRICKIN' COPS.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.517
[grunts]

15:39.438 --> 15:43.609
- MIKE, LET ME USE THE BATHROOM
REALLY QUICK BEFORE YOU SHOWER.

15:43.692 --> 15:46.528

OH, MY GOD, IT IS BAD.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.210
- HIS INSIDES
ARE COMING OUT.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.302
- OH, YEAH, I NEED
A PLUNGER FOR THAT.

16:10.386 --> 16:11.470
- I WAS LIKE, "FOR REAL?

16:11.553 --> 16:13.555
HE CLOGS THE TOILET
EVERY SUMMER.

16:13.639 --> 16:17.184
WE JUST HAVE TO HAVE A PLUMBER
ON SPEED DIAL FOR RON.

16:17.267 --> 16:18.727

IT'S ME, PAULY, AND VINNY,

16:24.650 --> 16:27.277
AND WE'RE GOING TO KILL IT

16:27.361 --> 16:29.196
I HAVE A GOOD FEELING.

16:29.279 --> 16:30.614
MY NAIL BROKE.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.827
- ANY MORE N135
IN THE BACK?

16:34.910 --> 16:35.911
- TOTALLY SOLD OUT.

16:35.994 --> 16:37.079
- WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO PUT ON THIS?

16:37.162 --> 16:38.247
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

REMOVED FROM THE BEACH

MY NAIL FIXED.

28:40.718 --> 28:43.138
- RON, YOU'RE THE SAVIOR
RIGHT NOW.

28:43.221 --> 28:45.056
I DON'T WANT TO GO
TO THE FUCKING NAIL SALON.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.391
I WANT TO GO TO THE BAR.

28:58.319 --> 29:01.030
- OH, DON'T THROW UP, PLEASE.
OH, HERE WE ARE.

29:01.114 --> 29:04.909
TO LOLA.

29:04.993 --> 29:06.161
YUM.

29:06.244 --> 29:09.330
ALL RIGHT, YOU DRINK.
YOU GET HUNG--UN-HUNGOVER.

29:09.414 --> 29:10.623
AND I'LL BE BACK
IN TWO SECONDS.

29:10.707 --> 29:11.791
- WHERE YOU GOING?
YOU'RE LEAVING ME.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.209
- I JUST NEED TO GO GET
SOMETHING REAL QUICK.

29:13.293 --> 29:15.837
SO RONNIE SAW THIS BIKE, LIKE,
A COUPLE DAYS ON THE BOARDWALK,

29:15.920 --> 29:18.590
AND HE WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOD.
I REALLY WANT IT."

29:18.673 --> 29:20.008
I'M LOOKING
FOR A FRICKIN' MOTORCYCLE.

29:20.091 --> 29:23.094
SO I LOVE RON TO DEATH.
HE'S LIKE MY BIG BROTHER.

29:23.178 --> 29:26.890
I MEAN, DUDE, I'M GONNA BUY RON
THE FRICKIN' MINIBIKE.

29:26.973 --> 29:30.935
OH!
YO, I'M BUYING THIS OFF YOU.

29:31.019 --> 29:33.021
YOU KNOW, I JUST LIKE RON
TO BE HAPPY.

29:33.104 --> 29:34.147

29:34.230 --> 29:36.691
I LOOK OVER.

29:36.774 --> 29:38.193
I'M JUST SEEING
SNOOKI'S HEAD FLOATING.

29:38.276 --> 29:40.487
I'M LIKE,
"WHAT IS THIS GIRL DOING?"

29:40.570 --> 29:43.865
- [laughs]
HERE'S YOUR MOTORCYCLE.

29:43.948 --> 29:44.866
- [laughs]
HOW ARE YOU?

29:44.949 --> 29:47.035
- IT NEEDS GAS.
- YOU GOT ME THE BIKE?

29:47.118 --> 29:48.745
- YEAH,
I WAS GONNA FUCKING, LIKE--

29:48.828 --> 29:49.704
- I'M BLOWN AWAY,
BECAUSE I NEVER THOUGHT

29:49.787 --> 29:52.457
THAT SNOOKI WAS ACTUALLY
THAT NICE.

29:52.540 --> 29:54.959
THANK YOU, SNOOK.
- OF COURSE, RON.

29:55.043 --> 29:57.420
CAN I RIDE IT
AND YOU PUSH ME?

29:57.504 --> 30:00.340
SO THE BIKE DOES HAVE GAS IN IT,
BUT WE CAN'T RIDE IT,

30:00.423 --> 30:01.883
BECAUSE IF WE DO RIDE IT
ON THE BOARDWALK,

30:01.966 --> 30:03.259
WE'VE HAD A COUPLE DRINKS,

30:03.343 --> 30:04.344
AND WE'LL PROBABLY GET A DUI
AND GO TO JAIL.

30:04.427 --> 30:06.804
[pop music]

30:06.888 --> 30:10.225

THE WHOLE WAY

30:10.308 --> 30:11.434
DOWN THE BOARDWALK
WITH THE BIKE,

30:11.518 --> 30:13.061
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I FEEL COOL.

30:13.144 --> 30:14.896
SEE, I'M ON THE LINE.

30:14.979 --> 30:16.648

30:16.731 --> 30:19.901
[both laughing]

30:19.984 --> 30:20.902

30:20.985 --> 30:24.030
- YOU'RE PULLING
IN FRONT OF ME.

30:24.113 --> 30:25.281
DON'T DO THAT.

30:25.365 --> 30:27.867
- OH, SORRY.
SORRY, GRAMPS.

30:27.951 --> 30:28.993
- LET'S GET HIM.
LET'S GET HIM.

30:29.077 --> 30:30.787
- YEAH, GO. GO.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.413
EXCUSE ME, GRAMPS.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.916
- TO AVERAGE PEOPLE,
THAT'S A MINIBIKE.

30:34.999 --> 30:38.086
TO NICOLE, THAT'S, LIKE, A
NORMAL-SIZE MOTORCYCLE FOR HER.

30:38.169 --> 30:39.504
IT'S FUCKING AMAZING.

30:39.587 --> 30:40.255
YOU GOT IT?

30:40.338 --> 30:42.423
HOLY SHIT.

30:42.507 --> 30:44.801
- [screams]

30:44.884 --> 30:47.428
AND THEN I LOOK BACK, AND RON'S
NOT HOLDING ME ANYMORE.

30:47.512 --> 30:50.014
AND I'M LEGIT, LIKE, GOING
50 MILES AN HOUR DOWN THIS RAMP.

30:50.098 --> 30:51.224
- BRAKES!
START TO BRAKE!

30:51.307 --> 30:52.684
- AND I'M LIKE,
"COOL, I'M GONNA DIE."

30:52.767 --> 30:55.687
I CAN'T STOP.
[giggles]

30:55.770 --> 30:56.896

VANESSA, COME HERE.

31:03.695 --> 31:04.821

31:04.904 --> 31:06.573

WITH NICOLE,

31:06.656 --> 31:07.448
AND I'M NOT GONNA LIE.

31:07.532 --> 31:09.492
- CAN WE CUDDLE TONIGHT?
- YEP.

31:09.576 --> 31:11.077
THIS IS KIND OF QUESTIONABLE,
WHAT I'M DOING.

31:11.160 --> 31:13.621
- COOL.

31:16.749 --> 31:18.126
- TIME TO GO TO WORK.

31:18.209 --> 31:19.836
- MIKE,
TIME TO GO TO WORK.

31:19.919 --> 31:21.921
MIKE,
TIME TO GO TO WORK.

31:22.005 --> 31:26.467
- YOU KNOW WHAT TIME
WE GO TO WORK.

31:26.551 --> 31:27.885
- SHORE STORE EMPLOYEE.

31:27.969 --> 31:29.470
- I WORK THERE.
I'M A NEW EMPLOYEE.

31:29.554 --> 31:30.722
- YOU WORK THERE?
- YEAH.

31:30.805 --> 31:32.140

31:32.223 --> 31:33.266
-<i> OY VEY.</i>

31:33.349 --> 31:34.809
- HI.
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

31:34.892 --> 31:36.311
THIS IS WHAT IT SAYS
ON MY BOOTY SHORTS.

31:36.394 --> 31:38.062
- OH, THAT'S CUTE.
- WHO'S NEXT?

31:38.146 --> 31:40.982
- YES, THE FISH ON TOP
OF THE WHITE RICE, YES.

31:41.065 --> 31:45.028
AND THEN I WANT
A, UH, CHICKEN CAESAR WRAP.

31:45.111 --> 31:46.362
- WHO'S NEXT?

31:46.446 --> 31:47.572
SO I GOT

31:47.655 --> 31:48.698
IT'S ME, SITUATION,
AND JENNI.

31:48.781 --> 31:52.243
- I WANT
TWO PIECES OF SALMON.

31:52.327 --> 31:54.829
- SO I EXPECT TO BE DOING
MOST OF THE WORKING.

31:54.912 --> 31:57.874
- I JUST GOT MAD FOOD.
- TWO TIMES.

31:57.957 --> 31:59.709
ONE, TWO.

32:02.503 --> 32:04.589
[creepy music]

32:04.672 --> 32:07.884

32:13.931 --> 32:16.017
- OH, MY GOD.

32:16.100 --> 32:19.687
JUST LOOK AT HER JUST, LIKE,
STARING STRAIGHT AHEAD

32:19.771 --> 32:21.856
BEHIND SOMEONE--
YOU SEE HER?

32:21.939 --> 32:24.400
PAULY, YOUR GIRL
IS CREEPING ME OUT RIGHT NOW.

32:24.484 --> 32:26.694
- ME TOO.

32:26.778 --> 32:29.197
SO I'M STUCK AT THE T-SHIRT SHOP
SLAVING AWAY.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.740
AND I LOOK UP,
AND MY STALKER'S THERE--VANESSA.

32:30.823 --> 32:33.284
THIS GIRL IS GOING TO KILL ME.

32:33.368 --> 32:34.535
SHE'S GONNA KIDNAP ME,

32:34.619 --> 32:37.288
PUT ME IN HER BASEMENT,
HAVE ME DJ FOR HER,

32:37.372 --> 32:38.414
AND I'M GONNA BE M.I.A.

32:38.498 --> 32:39.791
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA BE LOOKING
FOR ME.

32:39.874 --> 32:41.959
- PAULY'S STALKER
OFFICIALLY SCARES ME.

32:42.043 --> 32:43.670
- SHE'S GOT THAT BAG
ALL THE TIME.

32:43.753 --> 32:45.630
- OH, YEAH, I'M ABOUT TO--
I'M PROBABLY GONNA ASK TODAY.

32:45.713 --> 32:47.423
- YOU GOTTA.
- TODAY'S MY DAY.

32:47.507 --> 32:48.925
AT THIS POINT,
I AM JUST SO FED UP

32:49.008 --> 32:51.886
WITH SEEING THIS GIRL
CREEPING ME OUT.

32:51.969 --> 32:53.137
I WANT TO APPROACH HER,

32:53.221 --> 32:54.555
AND I WANT TO ASK
WHAT THE HELL HER DEAL IS.

32:54.639 --> 32:56.140
VANESSA, COME HERE.

32:58.768 --> 33:01.729
WE ALL GOTTA KNOW...
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

33:01.813 --> 33:02.730
- YO, WHY DO YOU GOTTA MESS

33:02.814 --> 33:06.234
- WHAT'S IN THE BAG?

33:06.317 --> 33:07.443
- NOTHING.

33:07.527 --> 33:10.571
- NOTHING IN THE BAG?
- BLANKET.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.156
- JUST A BLANKET?
- YEAH.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.991
- VANESSA'S TRYING TO SAY
THAT THERE'S A BLANKET

33:14.075 --> 33:15.284
IN THE BAG, BUT SHE DOESN'T
PULL IT OUT FOR ME.

33:15.368 --> 33:19.163
I THINK THE BLANKET IS WRAPPED
AROUND SOMETHING HEAVY.

33:19.247 --> 33:23.918
IT'S EITHER PAULY'S HAIR
OR A CHAIN SAW.

33:24.001 --> 33:25.253
- I KNOW WHAT'S IN THE BAG NOW--
A BLANKET.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.422
MAYBE THAT'S THE BLANKET
SHE WAS GONNA KILL ME IN.

33:27.505 --> 33:29.298
YO, IT'S NOT
DJ PAULY D ANYMORE.

33:29.382 --> 33:30.383
IT'S GONNA BE
DJ PAULY DEAD.

33:30.466 --> 33:32.593
- AM I MAKING YOU AWKWARD
RIGHT NOW?

33:32.677 --> 33:34.470
LITTLE BIT, HUH?

33:34.554 --> 33:36.139

AWKWARD?

33:36.222 --> 33:40.518
- YO, HONESTLY,

33:40.601 --> 33:43.563
GOT A BOYFRIEND?

33:43.646 --> 33:46.774
