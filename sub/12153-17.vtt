00:13.900 --> 00:15.800
- Harmony...
- [Harmony] I know.

00:15.800 --> 00:18.100
- I called everyone. They're just...
- Not here.

00:18.100 --> 00:21.300
I can see that.
If they were here, I wouldn't be alone.

00:21.300 --> 00:22.600
Why am I alone?

00:22.600 --> 00:25.500
Well, you can be super grouchy.

00:25.500 --> 00:28.700
- The meeting?
- Everybody's otherwise <i>ocupado,</i> boss.

00:28.700 --> 00:30.400
<i>Wesley's stuck babysitting...</i>

00:30.400 --> 00:33.600
Miss I Used To Rule the World,
Bow Down Before Me, Minion Scum.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.100
- Why are we not killing her again?
- Gunn?

00:36.100 --> 00:39.300
Maybe, if we had a really big one.

00:39.300 --> 00:40.800
Where is Gunn?

00:40.800 --> 00:43.500
Oh. The hospital still.

00:43.500 --> 00:46.500
You know,
from when Wesley... Krrr!

00:46.500 --> 00:50.300
- And Lorne's kinda M.I.A. Since...
- Fred.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.900
Okeydokey, then.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.400
Where's the rest of the crew?

01:03.400 --> 01:05.300
Apparently not coming.

01:05.300 --> 01:09.100
- But this is an important meeting.
- At least somebody...

01:09.400 --> 01:13.200
My first official parley as a very
loosely affiliated member of the...

01:13.200 --> 01:16.100
What are we?
Tell me we're not Scoobies.

01:16.100 --> 01:19.900
- We don't have a...
- A name? That's probably for the best.

01:19.900 --> 01:22.700
You'd wanna be
"Angel's Avengers" or something.

01:22.700 --> 01:25.800
"Angel's Avengers"?
That's...

01:25.800 --> 01:27.700
So, what's on the agenda?

01:30.000 --> 01:33.800
- Uh, I have assignments for people...
<i>- [Pops Can Top]</i>

01:33.800 --> 01:35.600
What?

01:35.600 --> 01:37.800
I'm listening with beer.

01:37.800 --> 01:40.800
Forget it.
This isn't a meeting.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.300
This is you being annoying.

01:43.300 --> 01:46.100
- Oh!
- Hey, bullet points.

01:46.100 --> 01:48.600
Classy.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.800
Why am I always reconnaissance?

01:50.800 --> 01:54.000
I should get a decently flash gig
like "save the girl,"

01:54.000 --> 01:55.800
or "steal the emerald with the girl."

01:55.800 --> 01:59.700
- "Handsome man saved me from the monsters."
<i>- Exactly.</i>

01:59.700 --> 02:02.400
Or... What's that, now?

02:02.400 --> 02:06.200
That's the first thing
Fred said to me in Pylea.

02:09.500 --> 02:13.500
She was trapped, hiding, afraid.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.400
Nearly crazy.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.300
Crazy, but brave.

02:20.200 --> 02:23.000
I should never
have let her come here.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.900
Bad things always happen here.

02:24.900 --> 02:27.800
Hate to break it to you, mate,
but bad things always happen everywhere.

02:28.900 --> 02:32.400
<i>Besides, she wanted to be here.</i>

02:32.400 --> 02:34.100
- It was her choice.
- Was it?

02:35.500 --> 02:37.700
Bugger.

02:37.700 --> 02:39.800
You're fixin' to do
something stupid, aren't you?

02:39.800 --> 02:41.800
Done it.
Came here.

02:41.800 --> 02:45.700
<i>Spend every day lying to myself...</i>

02:45.700 --> 02:48.300
about making the world a better place.

02:48.300 --> 02:50.600
<i>Welcome to the planet.</i>

02:50.600 --> 02:54.200
We all paint on our happy faces
every day, when all we really want...

02:54.200 --> 02:57.100
is to pound the neighbor's missus,
steal his Ben Franklins...

02:57.100 --> 02:59.700
<i>and while we're at it not think about...</i>

02:59.700 --> 03:01.500
the third of the world
that's starving to death.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.600
<i>I'm not saying that</i>
<i>I can fix everything.</i>

03:03.600 --> 03:07.500
I just... l... I have to do better.
The senior partners have a plan.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.400
Yeah, the prophecy.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.400
That ever-lovin' apocalypse
you keep goin' on about.

03:11.400 --> 03:14.300
Yeah, which apocalypse?
The one last year, or the year before that?

03:14.300 --> 03:16.300
No, the senior partners
are up to something now...

03:16.300 --> 03:18.200
and I'm not waitin' for them
to spring it on us.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.300
We're through operating in the dark.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.700
Okay, then.

03:22.700 --> 03:26.200
Might be easier if we knew anyone
who had a direct line to the big guys.

03:28.600 --> 03:31.900
No way. Even if my connection
to the senior partners...

03:31.900 --> 03:34.300
wasn't completely severed,
I'm done helping you.

03:34.300 --> 03:36.300
This isn't a negotiation, Eve.

03:36.300 --> 03:39.700
Ooh, I'm intimidated.
What could you possibly do to me?

03:39.700 --> 03:43.000
- I've been trapped in this house for weeks like a...
- Rat?

03:43.000 --> 03:45.700
Snake?
Beady little rat snake?

03:45.700 --> 03:48.900
You're not trapped, Eve. You're hiding.
You know the second you step out that door...

03:48.900 --> 03:52.900
<i>the second you don't have these symbols</i>
<i>keeping you invisible to the partners...</i>

03:53.100 --> 03:55.300
they're gonna zero in.

03:55.300 --> 03:58.100
So don't bother playing the pity angle.

03:58.100 --> 04:00.900
The only thing you care about
is saving your own ass.

04:00.900 --> 04:03.300
The only thing I care about is gone.

04:03.300 --> 04:06.200
You gave him up to the senior partners.
Let them suck him into the...

04:06.200 --> 04:09.800
Could do the same to you. Tell 'em
how to see through your security system.

04:09.800 --> 04:12.400
- You wouldn't.
- Not if you tell me what I wanna know.

04:12.400 --> 04:15.600
<i>[Rumbling]</i>

04:15.600 --> 04:18.000
- You bastard! You told them!
- Wasn't me.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.800
<i>Oh, God.</i>
<i>They're coming.</i>

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Please, don't let them take me!

04:25.000 --> 04:27.900
Angel, please! I'll tell you!
I'll tell you anything you wanna know!

04:35.800 --> 04:38.000
[Creaking]

05:30.300 --> 05:34.300
<i>[Singing]</i>

05:41.600 --> 05:44.300
<i>She's gonna say no, isn't she?</i>

05:44.300 --> 05:46.900
I should've gotten the bigger ring.

05:46.900 --> 05:50.300
June wedding.
There's rain, so get a tent.

05:50.300 --> 05:52.800
- She's gonna say yes?
- Ain't love grand?

05:52.800 --> 05:55.300
- I'm gettin' hitched?
- Yeah.

05:55.300 --> 05:58.600
More sea, less breeze, huh?

05:58.600 --> 06:02.100
- From now on, your money's no good here.
- All right.

06:02.100 --> 06:05.900
I was wonderin'...
about the possibility of a Carlos Junior.

06:05.900 --> 06:08.000
What do you think?

06:08.000 --> 06:11.400
What do I think?
I think I'm tired.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.900
<i>I think I'm sick and tired</i>
<i>of wearin'bells on my toes...</i>

06:14.900 --> 06:17.200
and making like everything's
gonna be okay.

06:17.200 --> 06:20.300
<i>I think it's pathetic that lately</i>
<i>I'm too scared and sad...</i>

06:20.300 --> 06:23.800
to tell people the truth, so I just say
what they wanna hear instead.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.700
Most of all,
I think the term "happy hour"...

06:25.700 --> 06:28.500
should be banned
from the English language.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.700
There's nothing happy about
this hour or any other.

06:30.700 --> 06:33.100
Oh.

06:33.100 --> 06:36.000
What I know is,
I started drinking...

06:36.000 --> 06:41.300
the moment that I found out
that a girl I loved was gonna die.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.200
And every time I get
to the bottom of the glass...

06:43.200 --> 06:47.000
I hope that that last drop
is gonna take me the distance.

06:49.300 --> 06:53.300
- Okay.
- A simple plan that failed utterly.

06:53.300 --> 06:56.400
Which is why I'm going to heave
my tokus off this stool...

06:56.400 --> 06:59.000
strap the bells on...

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
and with a smile and a quip
go back into the belly...

07:03.000 --> 07:06.900
of a very ugly beast
and pretend like I can help.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.900
Mmm.

07:08.900 --> 07:11.300
'Cause that's what the green guy does.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.700
- Harmony?
<i>- Yepper?</i>

07:15.700 --> 07:17.600
Call Security.
Put 'em on red alert.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.500
Nobody gets in this building
without clearance from me.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.700
I want a guard at every entrance,
every elevator, every stairwell.

07:21.700 --> 07:24.000
- Cover the whole building.
- Okay, but you know how that never works...

07:24.000 --> 07:25.900
- Harmony.
- On it.

07:25.900 --> 07:28.700
All right. Stay with Eve.
Anything gets past Security, kill it.

07:28.700 --> 07:31.800
- Where are you goin'?
- To see my lawyer.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.000
We have a problem.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.100
Senior partners found Eve.
They sent somethin' to take her out.

07:51.100 --> 07:54.000
<i>I need to know if I have</i>
<i>jurisdiction to protect her.</i>

07:54.000 --> 07:56.600
What's protocol here?

07:58.100 --> 08:01.200
- I don't know.
- Right.

08:01.200 --> 08:05.900
Well, when you're through reading
about important things like...

08:08.200 --> 08:11.100
"Trista and Ryan's Big Baby Plans"...

08:11.100 --> 08:13.200
maybe you can put
some thought into it.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.900
- I'm just not sure.
- Gunn.

08:16.900 --> 08:21.300
You paid a high price
for what's in that brain, so use it.

08:27.400 --> 08:29.600
There's a proviso in your contract.

08:29.600 --> 08:32.100
<i>Says that as C.E.O. Of</i>
<i>a Wolfram and Hart branch...</i>

08:32.100 --> 08:34.299
you can invoke a <i>rapio salvus</i> order.

08:34.299 --> 08:37.700
Basically says you're taking custody
of a wayward employee.

08:37.700 --> 08:39.799
It's not usually used for protection,
but it should work.

08:39.799 --> 08:42.299
- Great. How do l...
- I'll make a call.

08:42.299 --> 08:44.800
Good.

08:47.900 --> 08:50.700
Listen, Gunn.

08:50.700 --> 08:54.200
I know you feel bad about your part...

08:54.200 --> 08:57.400
what happened to Fred.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.800
And you should.

08:59.800 --> 09:04.300
<i>For the rest of your life, it should</i>
<i>wake you up in the middle of the night.</i>

09:04.300 --> 09:06.500
And it will...

09:06.500 --> 09:08.300
because you're a good man.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.900
You signed a piece of paper.
That's all.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.300
But I knew.

09:15.300 --> 09:20.200
Not about Fred, but when I signed,
I knew there would be consequences.

09:20.200 --> 09:26.000
Thing about atonement is, you never run
out of chances. But you gotta take 'em.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.900
<i>You can't hide in some hospital room</i>
<i>and pretend it's all gonna go away...</i>

09:31.300 --> 09:33.100
'cause it never will.

09:38.700 --> 09:41.900
<i>[Fred]</i>
<i>You have a visitor.</i>

09:41.900 --> 09:44.200
I thought I was in isolation.

09:49.300 --> 09:51.400
Whose fault is that?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Tell me a joke.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.100
Two men walk into a bar.

10:05.100 --> 10:08.400
The first man orders
a scotch and soda.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.300
The second man remembers
something he'd forgotten...

10:11.300 --> 10:14.600
and it doubles him over with pain.

10:14.600 --> 10:17.500
He falls to the floor shaking...

10:17.500 --> 10:21.100
and then through the floor
and into the earth.

10:21.100 --> 10:24.500
He looks back up at the first man,
but he doesn't call out to him.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
They're not that close.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.600
Yeah.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.600
You always know where you are.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.000
It's my particular skill.

10:43.300 --> 10:47.100
This is only the first layer.

10:47.100 --> 10:49.700
Don't you wanna see how deep I go?

10:55.900 --> 10:59.900
[Illyria]
You've been sitting for a long time.

10:59.900 --> 11:03.900
Yeah. Dozed off.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.900
You drank a great deal
of that poison.

11:06.900 --> 11:11.200
<i>You called me a lot of names</i>
<i>meant to hurt feelings I no longer have.</i>

11:11.200 --> 11:14.200
And then you sat there for hours
making noise with your nose.

11:14.200 --> 11:17.000
I was dreaming, you twit.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.800
You said her name.

11:18.800 --> 11:22.100
<i>Fred.</i>

11:22.100 --> 11:24.200
It was a nightmare.

11:26.200 --> 11:29.300
I don't suppose
you have nightmares or sleep...

11:29.300 --> 11:31.900
or any of that human crap.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.200
In my time,
nightmares walked among us.

11:34.200 --> 11:38.100
<i>Walked and danced,</i>
<i>skewering victims in plain sight...</i>

11:38.100 --> 11:41.900
laying their fears and worst desires out
for everyone to see.

11:43.100 --> 11:44.900
This to make us laugh.

11:46.800 --> 11:50.200
I'll bet you were jolly as frat boys.

11:50.200 --> 11:55.100
And now, nightmares are trapped
inside the heads of humans.

11:55.100 --> 11:57.600
Pitiful echoes of themselves.

11:57.600 --> 12:01.100
I wonder whom they angered so
to merit such a fate.

12:03.600 --> 12:06.600
This world must be a terrible
disappointment to you.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.700
Grievous.

12:11.700 --> 12:14.500
I'm not too impressed with it myself.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.300
Why don't you leave?

12:25.300 --> 12:27.400
<i>Brilliant. Really.</i>

12:27.400 --> 12:32.200
They'll never look for me here.
I'm gonna die.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.400
You make it hard for me
to wanna help you.

12:34.400 --> 12:38.100
We don't wanna help her,
but we will.

12:38.100 --> 12:41.200
- You're under my protection.
<i>- Thank the gods.</i>

12:41.200 --> 12:43.400
But, you know, I can take it away
with one phone call.

12:43.400 --> 12:45.600
- Convince me not to, Eve.
- How can I?

12:45.600 --> 12:49.000
- Let's start with something easy, huh? You.
- Me?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.100
What are you?
What do you do for the senior partners?

12:51.100 --> 12:54.200
I'm a liaison.
I liaise.

12:56.900 --> 13:00.500
What do you want me to say?
I'm a leprechaun. I'm from Brigadoon.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.600
If I had a nickel for
every time I heard that one...

13:02.600 --> 13:04.900
There are layers upon layers
at Wolfram and Hart, Angel.

13:04.900 --> 13:08.200
Things you'll never understand.
What am I?

13:08.200 --> 13:11.500
I'm a child of the senior partners,
created to do their bidding.

13:13.100 --> 13:15.800
You're an immortal.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.500
- Why are you here?
- To watch.

13:18.500 --> 13:22.100
Tell them what I see.
Pass on messages to you, if there are any.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.100
<i>So you're, uh, middle management?</i>

13:24.100 --> 13:27.100
<i>- What are the senior partners?</i>
<i>Huh? What are they?</i>
- No idea.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.600
- Eve...
- Do you honestly believe...

13:29.600 --> 13:32.000
the senior partners would let me
have access to that information?

13:32.000 --> 13:35.600
Angel, for someone so old,
you're so young.

13:35.600 --> 13:39.200
I only know what they want me to know,
and only when they want me to know it.

13:39.200 --> 13:43.700
- You don't know anything?
- Maybe. Maybe I know a lot.

13:43.700 --> 13:45.500
But I don't have access to it.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.800
It's locked in my head somewhere,
and I don't have the key.

13:51.700 --> 13:54.700
Ready for the funny part?

13:54.700 --> 13:58.000
There was someone who could have
told you everything you want to know...

13:58.000 --> 14:01.100
and you let the senior partners
take him away.

14:01.100 --> 14:03.800
Lindsey.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.700
Lindsey's dedicated years of his life
to the study of the senior partners.

14:06.700 --> 14:08.600
No one knows more
about them than he does.

14:08.600 --> 14:12.900
<i>- What they've done, what they plan to do.</i>
- I thought he was after me.

14:12.900 --> 14:16.700
You're saying bringing Spike back, the
fail-safe... that was all about the senior partners?

14:16.700 --> 14:20.500
No, it's about you too.
He really doesn't like you.

14:20.500 --> 14:25.600
<i>But he may know more about you</i>
<i>than, well, than you do.</i>

14:26.700 --> 14:28.600
Which is why
they snatched him up.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.000
Yeah. They couldn't risk
him and you havin' a sit-down.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.700
And now,
what he's going through...

14:34.700 --> 14:39.900
- They didn't kill him?
- They would want him to suffer horrors.

14:39.900 --> 14:45.000
Lindsey is in some hideous,
awful hell.

14:52.700 --> 14:56.000
- Good morning.
- Mmm. So far.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.100
- Stop it!
- Hey!

15:00.100 --> 15:02.600
- That's how I get sisters.
- Oh, really?

15:02.600 --> 15:05.200
Is that right?

15:06.600 --> 15:10.500
So, what are we gonna do today?

15:47.100 --> 15:50.400
<i>There's thousands of</i>
<i>different kinds ofhells.</i>

15:50.400 --> 15:54.000
You got your fire hell,
your ice hell, your...

15:56.300 --> 15:59.900
ice hell,
your upside-down hell...

15:59.900 --> 16:02.200
Look, I don't care if he's
in toy poodles on parade hell.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.200
He's got information that we need.

16:04.200 --> 16:07.100
According to the girl,
whose only reason for being is to see...

16:07.100 --> 16:09.100
<i>- her little pookie bear again.</i>
- I'm not lying.

16:09.100 --> 16:11.500
Tell him I'm not lying.

16:11.500 --> 16:14.900
No one can fake it through the piña colada
song, not once the chorus kicks in.

16:14.900 --> 16:18.500
If Lindsey can tell me what the senior
partners have planned, I want him.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.300
You got a better idea
how to do it, I'm totally open.

16:20.300 --> 16:23.300
Didn't say that.
Just pointed out that this one sucks.

16:23.300 --> 16:26.500
<i>We're lookin'for a hell dimension in</i>
<i>a haystack. How are we supposed to know...</i>

16:26.500 --> 16:29.300
<i>I know, and I can get us in.</i>

16:29.300 --> 16:30.700
Us?

16:32.900 --> 16:35.000
Okay, from the top.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
- The Earth's outer layer is called...
- The crust.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.200
- And what's underneath that?
- Um, the mantle?

16:41.200 --> 16:44.000
Yeah. And under that?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.700
Come on.
You know this one.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.200
The outer core.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.300
- And under that?
- The inner core.

16:51.300 --> 16:55.900
- And under that?
- Underneath that? Nothing.

16:55.900 --> 16:58.300
- Just a soft, chewy center.
- Ha-ha.

16:58.300 --> 17:00.700
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Hey, hon?</i>

17:00.700 --> 17:03.400
Oven light just went out.
I need a bulb from the cellar.

17:05.099 --> 17:07.000
Should be some in the hall closet.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.599
Just regular ones.
Little ones are downstairs.

17:11.900 --> 17:14.500
Well, Zach, uh... Zach was gettin' ready
to fill me in on the lithosphere.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.800
I kinda need it now.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.200
All right.
I'll be right back.

17:33.500 --> 17:36.400
They're on that shelf
where we keep those thingies.

18:11.700 --> 18:14.100
<i>I started flippin'through the brain files</i>
<i>as soon as Harmony told me.</i>

18:14.100 --> 18:16.400
- Figured there had to be some kind of precedent.
- And?

18:16.400 --> 18:19.300
Senior partners had trouble with a guy
in the Tokyo division way back.

18:19.300 --> 18:22.500
Lindsey probably got the tattoo idea
from studying up on him.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.700
- And wherever they sent this guy,
that's where Lindsey is.
- Yep.

18:24.700 --> 18:27.500
I hope it's Toy Poodle hell.
I've had my fill of fire.

18:27.500 --> 18:30.000
It's not hell.
It's a Wolfram and Hart holding dimension.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.300
Meaning what? The senior partners
haven't decided what to do with Lindsey?

18:33.300 --> 18:36.500
- Their version of a penalty box.
- Great.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.600
So, how are we
supposed to get there?

18:38.600 --> 18:40.600
Ever taken the Camaro?

18:45.600 --> 18:47.700
This is weirdin' me out.

18:47.700 --> 18:50.500
Is this weirding you out?

18:50.500 --> 18:55.400
What, you never heard of <i>Knight Rider?</i>
Knight Industries 2000?

18:55.400 --> 18:57.600
KITT?

18:57.600 --> 18:59.500
- Never mind.
- Car's built to get us there.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.800
Once we have Lindsey,
it's on us to find the Wrath.

19:01.800 --> 19:04.800
The Wrath?
You know that's gonna be a giggle.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.800
Whatever it is,
we gotta go through it to get out.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.100
I've never seen
these streets before.

19:11.100 --> 19:12.800
Where we're goin',
not in the <i>Thomas Guide.</i>

19:12.800 --> 19:14.800
There's gonna be fire.

19:26.700 --> 19:30.300
This isn't hell.
It's the burbs.

19:30.300 --> 19:34.800
- Close enough.
- This is Lindsey's punishment for trying to kill me?

19:34.800 --> 19:37.700
[Scoffs]
Maybe it's a reward.

19:37.700 --> 19:41.300
<i>- You could go anywhere. You could leave.</i>
- That's not possible.

19:41.300 --> 19:44.200
Of course it's possible.
Are you telling me the great Illyria...

19:44.200 --> 19:47.200
idol of millions,
was limited to one small dimension?

19:47.200 --> 19:49.900
I traveled all of them as I pleased.

19:51.800 --> 19:55.400
I walked worlds of smoke
and half-truths intangible.

19:57.100 --> 20:00.700
Worlds of torment...

20:00.700 --> 20:03.000
and of unnameable beauty.

20:04.800 --> 20:08.300
Opaline towers
as high as small moons.

20:08.300 --> 20:12.200
<i>Glaciers that rippled</i>
<i>with insensate lust.</i>

20:12.200 --> 20:16.600
And one world
with nothing but shrimp.

20:16.600 --> 20:20.300
- I tired of that one quickly.
- Then why stay in this one?

20:20.300 --> 20:23.400
Surely there's a world
more appealing.

20:23.400 --> 20:27.400
Maybe not the shrimp one, but one where
you'd be welcome like you never will be here.

20:29.700 --> 20:31.200
Why don't you go?

20:31.200 --> 20:33.100
You can go.

20:33.100 --> 20:35.200
Why don't you go?

20:35.200 --> 20:37.200
[Panting]

20:37.200 --> 20:39.500
[Grunts]
It's too small.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.400
<i>It's too small.</i>
<i>I can't breathe.</i>

20:41.400 --> 20:44.100
I can't live with these walls.
I can't breathe.

20:44.100 --> 20:46.200
<i>There's no room for anything real.</i>

20:46.200 --> 20:50.000
- It's all right.
- I should gut you where you stand.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.800
You challenge me. But there's
not enough space to open my jaws.

20:54.800 --> 20:58.300
<i>My face is not my face.</i>
<i>I don't know what... what it will say.</i>

20:58.300 --> 21:02.600
<i>Illyria, come with me.</i>

21:46.600 --> 21:51.100
Oh, so we just open with being on fire.
That's great.

21:51.100 --> 21:53.700
Well, we can put our coats over our heads
and make a run for it.

21:53.700 --> 21:56.800
[Both Yell]

21:56.800 --> 22:00.700
Alternate dimension, remember?
Sun's the non-frying variety.

22:00.700 --> 22:03.300
- Figured that.
- Oh, right.

22:03.300 --> 22:05.300
Can we go?

22:05.300 --> 22:06.900
Yeah.

22:06.900 --> 22:08.700
<i>[Angel]</i>
<i>We grab Lindsey and we get out.</i>

22:08.700 --> 22:11.900
- Kill anything in our way.
- What's gonna be in our way, the family mutt?

22:11.900 --> 22:13.800
- This is Wolfram and Hart.
<i>- [Doorbell Rings]</i>

22:13.800 --> 22:15.800
Odds are there's something
ugly behind that door.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.200
Can I help you?

22:23.800 --> 22:25.700
Uh, is Lindsey home?

22:25.700 --> 22:27.200
Sure. Come on in.

22:30.400 --> 22:32.200
Honey?

22:33.500 --> 22:36.800
- There's coffee.
- No, we're fine, thanks.

22:36.800 --> 22:40.000
Zach's hockey stick's gone missing. Oh.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.900
I didn't realize we had company.

22:41.900 --> 22:45.400
<i>- I'll do search and rescue.</i>
- Okay. How can I help you guys?

22:45.400 --> 22:47.900
Cut the act, Ward.
June's gone.

22:47.900 --> 22:51.700
- Excuse me?
- You don't know who we are?

22:51.700 --> 22:54.300
No.
Do you play in the league?

22:54.300 --> 22:59.400
No. Uh, I'm-I'm Angel.
This is Spike and Gunn.

22:59.400 --> 23:01.400
You might wanna have a seat.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.700
Okay.

23:03.700 --> 23:06.200
Please.

23:06.200 --> 23:09.000
Is this about the, uh,
free vacation I entered to win?

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Does the name Wolfram and Hart
mean anything to you?

23:11.000 --> 23:14.200
<i>It's a law firm.</i>
<i>You used to work there.</i>

23:17.300 --> 23:19.000
Sorry. Gunn, is it?
Yeah.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.700
No, the only lawyer I know is the one
that fixes my speeding tickets, so...

23:22.700 --> 23:25.100
That guy... he's not real.

23:26.500 --> 23:29.300
None of this is.

23:29.300 --> 23:31.200
You're under some spell.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.700
- What?
- Nuts and bolts, you're in hell.

23:33.700 --> 23:37.300
- We've come to break you out.
- All right, who put you up to this, huh?

23:37.300 --> 23:39.200
<i>- Was it Fisher?</i>
- There's no joke.

23:39.200 --> 23:42.000
<i>You're in a mystical holding cell...</i>
<i>an alternate reality.</i>

23:42.000 --> 23:45.600
So Trish is not my wife,
and Zach's not my son?

23:45.600 --> 23:48.300
Now he's gettin' it.
Ever heard of something called the Wrath?

23:48.300 --> 23:53.700
Seriously, is Fisher outside?
L... Come on.

23:53.700 --> 23:55.800
Lindsey, this whole life is a lie.

24:00.700 --> 24:04.400
All right.
This is startin' to get a little less funny.

24:04.400 --> 24:07.500
I think you guys should leave.

Oh, calm down, Chicken Little. Nobody can

Yeah, I got strict instructions.
No torture. You're totally safe.

Look, you don't get it.
Some stupid legal order isn't gonna matter.

Get off of me!

Make it quick.

Oh, hi.
Your hubby was just showin' us a thing.

Get Lindsey in the car!
Go, now!

26:11.000 --> 26:13.100
- Didn't we have a car?
- [Tires Screeching]

- Our bloody ride's gone!
- Get down!

26:28.800 --> 26:30.700
We gotta find the Wrath!
Where's the Wrath?

26:30.700 --> 26:32.700
Where's not the Wrath?
Wrath's all over!

- Lindsey, think. Do you know where it is?
<i>- [Lindsey] I don't know.!</i>

26:36.100 --> 26:37.900
Door by the kitchen.
Might be a way out through the cellar.

26:37.900 --> 26:40.600
- No, we can't go down there! Not the cellar!
- Cellar it is, then.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.900
- Guess we found the Wrath.
- Go!

26:42.900 --> 26:45.000
Please, no! No!

26:48.200 --> 26:50.400
We're all gonna die.

- Not today.
- Every day!

Run, already!

29:53.500 --> 29:56.200
You knew.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.100
Thing about atonement.

30:00.600 --> 30:02.600
Gunn...

30:05.900 --> 30:08.600
- Let's go.
- You're not bloody serious.

30:08.600 --> 30:12.400
When I forget, the door closes.
Go.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.800
You have to.

30:18.900 --> 30:22.300
This is where...

30:22.300 --> 30:23.600
I was...

30:26.000 --> 30:28.600
I belong.

30:28.600 --> 30:30.800
I was...

30:30.800 --> 30:32.700
What was I doing?

30:33.900 --> 30:35.900
Why am I down here?

30:35.900 --> 30:38.400
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Honey, what are you doing down there?</i>

30:38.400 --> 30:41.900
I don't know.
Must be losin' my mind.

30:44.800 --> 30:47.000
We'll head up the coast to Canada.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
- Keys!
- Uh...

30:50.000 --> 30:51.900
<i>Come on.!</i>

30:54.100 --> 30:56.100
<i>[Car Alarm Chirping]</i>

30:56.100 --> 30:58.900
<i>Oh, holy motor pool.!</i>

30:59.900 --> 31:03.000
- There! Hurry!
- What do you call this?

31:08.300 --> 31:10.200
- You'll like Canada. Lots of deserters.
- Go!

31:12.000 --> 31:13.900
What the daisy...

31:13.900 --> 31:17.100
I'm on fire!
Oh. Never mind.

31:17.100 --> 31:19.800
Lindsey!

31:19.800 --> 31:22.300
What did they do to you?

31:22.300 --> 31:24.600
He'll be fine.

31:24.600 --> 31:28.000
Whereas we got shot and almost killed by
a juiced-up S&M demon. Thanks for asking.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.200
- Let's get upstairs.
- Be careful. He's hurt.

31:31.200 --> 31:34.300
Angel, you should know,
there's a very tall, well-dressed, uh...

31:34.300 --> 31:36.500
Where's Gunn?

31:36.500 --> 31:39.300
- Angel?
- He, uh... He stayed behind.

31:39.300 --> 31:43.600
Stayed behind?
But you never leave a...

31:44.800 --> 31:47.300
Or I guess we do.

31:47.300 --> 31:49.100
That's what we do now.

31:49.100 --> 31:51.700
<i>[Banging]</i>

31:51.700 --> 31:54.800
- Oh, God.
- Like I was saying.

32:02.600 --> 32:05.400
Damn.
He is well-dressed.

32:09.300 --> 32:12.300
Please, don't do this.

32:12.300 --> 32:15.200
Eve's under my protection.
You can't touch her.

32:19.100 --> 32:22.000
- Wow. I didn't see that coming.
- You know how it works, Eve.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.800
You could talk to the senior partners.
Tell them it's a mistake.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.900
- That's impossible.
- I said, back off.

32:29.600 --> 32:32.000
Don't bother, Angel.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.100
- It's over.
- Sign here.

32:37.300 --> 32:40.200
- Good girl.
- What the hell's goin' on?

32:40.200 --> 32:42.200
Oh, sorry for the intrusion.

32:42.200 --> 32:45.000
I'm Marcus Hamilton,
your new liaison to the senior partners.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.100
- And here.
- You're what?

32:47.100 --> 32:50.000
Along with her immortality
and certain other privileges...

32:50.000 --> 32:52.200
Eve has signed over
her duties to me.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.800
And...
Oh, and initial there.

32:54.800 --> 32:58.500
This is about a contract?
I thought you said you were gonna die.

32:58.500 --> 33:02.200
- And now, one day I will.
- The senior partners felt it was time for a change.

33:02.200 --> 33:05.600
Eve was too easily distracted.
Lost sight of the big picture.

33:05.600 --> 33:09.400
- I fell in love.
- Yes. Congratulations.

33:11.900 --> 33:14.200
Wonderful escape, by the way.
Very clever.

33:14.200 --> 33:18.100
We'll be in touch. Oh, I have some
excellent ideas I can't wait to share.

33:18.100 --> 33:20.800
This is my house.
The only ideas that matter are mine.

33:20.800 --> 33:23.000
Oh, absolutely.
That's the policy.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.400
The senior partners
are behind you 100%.

33:25.400 --> 33:28.200
I doubt that.

33:28.200 --> 33:30.500
I'm looking forward to
working myself into the mix.

33:30.500 --> 33:32.400
Angel. Spike.

33:33.500 --> 33:35.400
Welcome to the team.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.200
Well, he's not so bad.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.600
<i>Are you all right?</i>

33:49.600 --> 33:51.400
I breathe easier.

33:53.900 --> 33:57.600
The walls don't press in as hard
when you can't see them.

33:57.600 --> 34:01.300
- But they're still here.
- Yes.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
All I am is what I am.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.699
I lived seven lives at once.
I was power and the ecstasy of death.

34:09.699 --> 34:11.900
<i>I was god to a god.</i>

34:11.900 --> 34:13.699
Now...

34:16.100 --> 34:19.500
I'm trapped on a roof...

34:19.500 --> 34:23.500
just one roof,
in this time and this place...

34:23.600 --> 34:27.300
with an unstable human who drinks
too much whiskey and called me a Smurf.

34:27.300 --> 34:29.800
[Chuckles]

34:32.900 --> 34:34.600
You don't worship me at all, do you?

34:37.000 --> 34:39.600
And you really can't leave.

34:41.300 --> 34:44.699
I... don't know.

34:46.600 --> 34:49.900
I fear in any other dimension in this form,
I'd be but prey to those I knew.

34:53.800 --> 34:57.500
- I reek of humanity.
- Don't flatter yourself.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.300
Your world is so small...

35:12.800 --> 35:15.700
and yet you box yourselves
in rooms even smaller.

35:15.700 --> 35:20.700
You shut yourselves inside,
in rooms, in routines.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.800
There are things worse than walls...

35:26.300 --> 35:30.600
terrible and beautiful.

35:32.000 --> 35:36.500
If we look at them for too long,
they will burn right through us.

35:36.500 --> 35:38.900
Truths we couldn't bear.

35:40.500 --> 35:42.700
Not every day.

35:44.400 --> 35:46.300
We are so weak.

35:46.300 --> 35:49.600
Yes.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.500
Yes, we are.

35:59.500 --> 36:02.100
Ouch!
Take it easy, Green Jeans.

36:02.100 --> 36:07.100
Yeah. Fraid I don't have
Fredikin's gentle touch.

36:07.100 --> 36:09.900
- Just get on with it.
<i>- Mmm.</i>

36:11.400 --> 36:14.400
<i>Look.</i>
<i>It's the hero of the hour.</i>

36:14.400 --> 36:17.400
I'm not your hero.
I'm your warden.

36:17.400 --> 36:19.400
It's all how you look at the glass.

36:19.400 --> 36:21.800
<i>I'd have thought</i>
<i>a few months of torture...</i>

36:21.800 --> 36:24.800
at the hands of the senior partners
would've dug a little deeper.

36:24.800 --> 36:28.300
Just scratched the surface.
Turns out they can...

36:28.300 --> 36:31.900
only undo you as far as
you think you deserve to be undone.

36:31.900 --> 36:35.100
I wonder how Gunn's
gonna make out.

36:35.100 --> 36:37.900
The senior partners... I wanna know
everything you know about them.

36:37.900 --> 36:40.100
About the apocalypse,
about their plans for me.

36:40.100 --> 36:44.500
And for me. Guy with the pen said,
"Welcome to the team."

36:44.500 --> 36:47.800
- Must've meant something.
- You know what I know.

36:47.800 --> 36:50.500
<i>Look around.</i>
<i>The world's a cesspool...</i>

36:50.500 --> 36:52.800
<i>filled with selfish and greedy beasts.</i>

36:52.800 --> 36:56.800
We live.
We die.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.700
- Even you, babe.
- Lindsey, don't.

36:59.700 --> 37:03.600
- You still happy to see me?
<i>- [Angel] Yeah, hell's on earth.</i>

37:03.600 --> 37:06.100
Holland Manners tried to sell me
that line three years ago.

37:06.100 --> 37:09.800
- Did you ever prove him wrong?
- All how you look at the glass.

37:11.600 --> 37:15.100
You know, Lindsey,
we can philosophize all night.

37:15.100 --> 37:18.000
Hell, we can do it forever.

37:19.800 --> 37:24.300
<i>I don't need to eat, sleep, drink.</i>
<i>How about you?</i>

37:24.300 --> 37:27.700
That's what I like to see.
Angel of yore.

37:27.700 --> 37:30.400
<i>Takes no prisoners.</i>
<i>Suffers no fools.</i>

37:30.400 --> 37:33.500
How about this?
It's here.

37:33.500 --> 37:36.700
<i>It's been here all along, underneath.</i>

37:36.700 --> 37:40.600
- You're just too damned stupid to see it.
- See what?

37:40.800 --> 37:44.600
The apocalypse, man.
You're soakin' in it.

37:46.600 --> 37:50.100
I've seen an apocalypse or two in my time.
I'd know if one was under my nose.

37:50.100 --> 37:54.100
Not <i>an</i> apocalypse.
<i>The</i> apocalypse.

37:54.100 --> 37:57.200
<i>What, did you... did you think</i>
<i>a gong was gonna sound?</i>

37:57.200 --> 37:59.900
<i>Time tojump on your horses</i>
<i>and fight the big fight?</i>

38:01.700 --> 38:04.200
Starting pistol went off
a long time ago, boys.

38:04.200 --> 38:06.200
You're playing for the bad guys.

38:06.200 --> 38:10.000
<i>Every day you sit behind your desk</i>
<i>and you learn a little more...</i>

38:10.300 --> 38:12.200
<i>how to accept the world the way it is.</i>

38:12.200 --> 38:14.600
Well, here's the rub.

38:14.600 --> 38:17.100
Heroes don't do that.

38:17.100 --> 38:20.200
Heroes don't accept the world
the way it is.

38:20.200 --> 38:22.000
They fight it.

38:24.700 --> 38:27.600
You're saying everything we do...

38:29.600 --> 38:34.300
it's a distraction to keep us busy
from lookin' under the surface.

38:34.300 --> 38:37.000
Ding. We got a winner.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.300
<i>World keeps sliding towards</i>
<i>entropy and degradation.</i>

38:40.300 --> 38:42.700
And what do you do?

38:42.700 --> 38:46.600
You sit in your big chair
and you sign your checks...

38:46.600 --> 38:48.600
just like the senior partners planned.

38:51.800 --> 38:55.100
The war's here, Angel...

38:55.100 --> 38:57.600
and you're already two soldiers down.

39:01.400 --> 39:03.100
Come on.
You know this one.

39:03.100 --> 39:05.100
The outer core.

39:05.100 --> 39:07.200
And under that?

39:07.200 --> 39:09.300
- The inner core.
- Under that?

39:09.300 --> 39:12.400
Underneath that?
Nothing.

39:12.400 --> 39:15.200
- Just the soft, chewy center.
- Ha-ha.

39:15.200 --> 39:18.200
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Hey, hon?</i>

39:18.200 --> 39:20.900
Oven light just went out.
I need a bulb from the cellar.

39:22.300 --> 39:24.200
Uh, should be some
in the hall closet.

39:24.200 --> 39:26.800
Just the regular ones.
Little ones are downstairs.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.600
Zach's about to fill me in
on the lithosphere.

39:34.400 --> 39:38.200
I kinda need it now.
