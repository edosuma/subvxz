into the oil while it was cooking.

of the cricket exoskeleton
from the skull-wound trace...

from the grease.

My name’s Payne.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.787
And if your name’s
as accurate as mine,

22:12.874 --> 22:15.456
then we should get
better acquainted.

22:15.543 --> 22:18.376
Oh. Well, that’s, uh—

22:19.672 --> 22:22.163
I have a girlfriend.
I’m sorry.

22:22.258 --> 22:26.046
So? I have a boyfriend,
but he’s not coming
to this movie.

22:26.137 --> 22:29.925
- Is your girlfriend?
- No.

We’re just talkin’,
right?
Yeah.

22:33.520 --> 22:36.011
Albeit, somewhat suggestively.

22:36.105 --> 22:38.096
So I’ll change
the subject.

22:38.191 --> 22:42.104
Do you, uh—
Do you like my tattoos?

22:44.989 --> 22:49.107
Very much. I’ve always
enjoyed calligraphy.

Great. One of us needs
to relieve Sweets.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.122
I gotta write
a report up on this.

23:04.217 --> 23:07.050
There’s a lip here.
I’m thinking a smooth,
rounded edge.

23:07.136 --> 23:09.593
Okay. Sweets said
he had an appointment
he can’t miss, so—

23:09.681 --> 23:11.546
Follow me on this.

The mailman is delivering his package
to the lady of the house,

frying pan, huh?

23:21.776 --> 23:24.142
And wham!

23:25.613 --> 23:28.355
The postman who rang twice
never rang again.

23:28.491 --> 23:31.153
Yeah? Yeah.
That totally works.
Mm-hmm.

23:31.244 --> 23:33.826
If the husband is a peacock
wrangler who fights crickets
after work...

23:33.913 --> 23:35.824
in a creeping red fescue field.

23:35.957 --> 23:37.743
Peacock?
Yeah.

23:37.834 --> 23:41.418
What I thought was silk
turns out to be the thread from
the afterfeather of a peacock.

23:41.504 --> 23:43.415
You and your particulates—
always ruining the day for me.

23:43.506 --> 23:45.497

go relieve Sweets.

This is Steve Rifton’s

24:01.524 --> 24:03.936

have you watched this?
Oh. I’m not watching it.

I’m analyzing it.
And?

24:06.070 --> 24:08.686
Un/nterrupted control track,
which means no tampering.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.942
The only th/ng
you see on this tape
is the game playing.

24:11.034 --> 24:13.400
No hands. No audio.
Just the screen.

24:13.494 --> 24:15.701
Mm-hmm.

24:15.788 --> 24:18.450
This perfect game ’s been
downloaded and watched...

24:18.541 --> 24:22.284
hundreds of thousands of times

Not one anal-retentive,

is calling foul, so—

24:28.426 --> 24:30.132
Can I see the last part?

24:30.219 --> 24:33.677
The, uh, last stage of the game
is called the kill screen.

Wait. Can you
play that again?

What do you see ?

24:46.903 --> 24:51.567
The injuries that the monkey suffers
are the same as the victim’s.

[Device Beeps ]
Did the blood come
from our victim?

26:01.894 --> 26:04.476
No. Like the guy said,
it seems to have come
from a number of people,

26:04.564 --> 26:06.680
and it’s been totally
degraded by a liquid.

26:06.816 --> 26:09.273
Oh, what liquid?
Mostly cola.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.976
Here’s a Mikrosil cast
of the wound, Dr. Brennan.

26:12.071 --> 26:16.735
Well, I don’t see
any protuberances
on the machine...

26:16.826 --> 26:19.568
that correspond
to the shape of the wound.

26:19.662 --> 26:24.656
Also, no sign of crickets,
grass seed or peacock feathers.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.742
The particulates
Dr. Hodgins found.

26:26.836 --> 26:29.703
- Those particulates were
only found in the head wound?
- Yes.

26:29.797 --> 26:32.504
Is there anything on this
machine that could explain
the groin wound?

26:32.592 --> 26:35.379
There’s an access panel
at groin level.

26:36.763 --> 26:39.926
- I don’t see anything.
- Shall I get an A.L.S.?

26:40.016 --> 26:42.348
I don’t see how something
could pop out of there,

and then withdraw again.

caused that?

than bending and denting.

34:05.169 --> 34:07.911
We have photographic evidence
that our victim...

34:08.005 --> 34:10.212
actually played a perfect game
on his own machine.

34:10.299 --> 34:13.666
- Maybe the photo there
is doctored?
- Angela says no.

34:13.761 --> 34:16.753
Who wants to know
about peacock poop ?

34:18.015 --> 34:20.222
Okay. All right.
Not the greatest opening.

34:20.309 --> 34:22.391
But...

34:22.478 --> 34:24.434
I was looking
at this thing all wrong.

34:24.521 --> 34:27.513
I kept asking myself, how do
peacock feathers, graminoid
seeds and insect legs...

34:27.608 --> 34:29.564
get onto the same
blunt weapon ?

34:29.652 --> 34:32.018
That is exactly the question
we need answered.

34:32.112 --> 34:36.105
Sometimes peacock feathers
are in peacock poop because
they preen themselves.

34:36.200 --> 34:38.737
The ind/an Blue Peacock,
to be precise.

34:38.827 --> 34:42.035
The murder weapon
was dipped in Indian Blue
Peacock excrement?

34:42.122 --> 34:44.078
Pavo cristatus.

34:44.166 --> 34:48.079
Why would the murderer
dip his weapon
into peacock excrement?

34:48.170 --> 34:50.331
What if he didn’t
do it on purpose?
Check this out.

34:50.422 --> 34:53.209
The only two places
with lndian Blue Peacock...

34:53.300 --> 34:55.256
are the United States
Botanic Gardens...

34:55.344 --> 34:57.084
and the Annapolis Valley
Golf Course.

34:57.179 --> 34:59.670
The murder weapon
could have been a golf club.

34:59.765 --> 35:02.097
That would also exp/a/n
the crickets and the fescue.

35:02.184 --> 35:05.051
Let’s see which one
of our suspects golfs
at Annapolis Valley.

35:05.145 --> 35:08.808
Who deserves
a little love here, huh ?
A little lo ve ? Just—

35:08.899 --> 35:11.891
Okay. That’s all.
I really gotta go.
Um, king of the lab.

35:19.034 --> 35:21.366
Why are you standing
over here?

35:21.495 --> 35:23.736
What? Oh.
[ Fisher Laughing]

35:23.872 --> 35:25.783
[ Tory]
Knock it off
Oh!

35:25.874 --> 35:28.160
- [Fisher]
Whoa. Be careful with it.
- Fisher?

35:28.252 --> 35:30.163
Yea h .
Yeah. it bites.

35:30.254 --> 35:32.791
So he pitched his tent
when you didn’t?

35:32.881 --> 35:37.545
-By “pitch his tent,” you mean—
Yeah, that’s what he did.
-No, it’s not a play toy!

35:37.636 --> 35:40.423
Fisher said that
in the short amount of time
that l’ve been with Daisy,

35:40.514 --> 35:42.470
he pitched his tent
with seven women.

35:42.558 --> 35:44.469
Yeah, but come on.

35:44.560 --> 35:47.347
Fisher, he only
ever pitches his tent
once with each woman.

35:47.438 --> 35:52.023
You, you’re the kind of guy,
you don’t just pitch a tent,
you homestead the land.

35:52.109 --> 35:55.818
Oh. So he’s the rock star,
and I’m the farmer?
That’s great.

35:55.904 --> 35:58.896
Okay, Sweets. Let’s do
the math here, okay?

35:58.991 --> 36:01.528
Fisher’s seven women
versus your one Daisy.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.322
Oh, God.
Seven one-night stands.

36:04.413 --> 36:08.156
Let’s give him the benefit
of the doubt and say that he’s
had sex, what— 21 times. Okay?

36:08.250 --> 36:12.744
Now, rough estimate,
how many times have you
and Daisy pitched a tent?

36:14.757 --> 36:18.249
Daisy and l are together
approximately
five nights a week,

36:18.344 --> 36:20.835
so that’s 10 times a week
over seven months.

36:20.929 --> 36:23.921
- You add in the mornings—
- Whoa! Silent math.

36:24.058 --> 36:25.923
You got a number?
Yeah.

36:26.018 --> 36:28.680
Don’t... tell me.

36:28.812 --> 36:31.599
Is it more than 21?
It’s way more than 21.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.897
Quality of the experience.

36:33.984 --> 36:37.943
It’s much more important
than the quantity.

36:38.072 --> 36:41.439
[ Man ] Everybody get
your tickets out! S/ng/e file!
We are going in.

36:41.575 --> 36:43.486
No pushing.
Yes!

36:43.577 --> 36:45.442
E verybody’s gettin ’ in.

36:45.537 --> 36:49.280
- Should we, uh,
tell Fisher we’re goin’ in?
- You’re in trouble now!

36:49.416 --> 36:51.372
Hold on! Hold on tight!
Nah. Screw him.

36:51.460 --> 36:53.746
Okay! Wait!
But he’s gonna
miss the movie.

36:53.879 --> 36:56.495
[ Hodgins ] Yeah?
Well, serves him right.
[ Tory] Whoa-ho!

36:56.590 --> 36:59.923
Uh, if you were in my shoes,
you would’ve gone for her,
wouldn’t you?

37:00.010 --> 37:02.672
Heck, yeah.
Are you kidding me?
Did you see those tattoos?

37:02.805 --> 37:05.842
A w! Epic.
[Fisher]
Come on. There we go.

37:09.770 --> 37:11.977
Why do you want to see
my golf clubs ?

37:12.064 --> 37:14.521
You’re a member
of Annapolis Valley, right?

37:14.608 --> 37:18.351
Yes, for three years.
My golf clubs are
in here somewhere.

37:18.445 --> 37:21.778
l-l don ’t get out there
as much as l’d like.

37:21.865 --> 37:23.776
Dougie just
stands there all day,
wa/ting for his machine.

37:23.867 --> 37:26.734
- I’d like to get it back
as soon as possible.
- You’re very cooperative.

37:26.829 --> 37:29.411
- Booth?
- Yeah.

37:29.498 --> 37:32.240
Graphite shafts.
These would snap.

37:32.334 --> 37:36.077
We ’re look/ng for
a broken shaft that would
explain the stabbing wound.

37:36.171 --> 37:38.332
Any of ’em damaged?
No.

37:38.424 --> 37:40.540
None of these
is the murder weapon.

37:40.634 --> 37:43.717
What— You think
I killed the postman?

37:43.804 --> 37:45.760
Well, why would I
do that?

37:45.848 --> 37:50.683
Well, uh, perhaps it’s
a coincidence that Mr. Seeger’s
a member of the golf club.

37:50.769 --> 37:53.431
Perhaps we should
check out the poswbihties
at the botanic garden ?

37:53.522 --> 37:55.478
Where’s your 3-iron?

37:56.775 --> 37:58.640
Never needed one.

37:58.777 --> 38:01.484
What 3-i ron?
Guy like you,
course like Annapolis.

38:01.572 --> 38:03.904
You would definitely need
a 3-iron to hit that course.

38:03.991 --> 38:05.902
So where is it?

38:28.056 --> 38:30.923
My son only ever
had one thing—

38:31.018 --> 38:33.680
one thing
in his whole life.

38:35.397 --> 38:37.479
Dougie can’t even speak.

38:37.566 --> 38:39.557
Do you understand?

38:40.819 --> 38:42.901
[Man Singing: Ballad]

38:42.988 --> 38:45.855

38:48.660 --> 38:51.117

,r Lost in the wilderness ,r

38:56.376 --> 38:58.537

on his face.

38:58.629 --> 39:01.621

39:08.597 --> 39:10.963

And then, next th/ng you know,
he’s on Tl/saying he played
the perfect game.

39:16.104 --> 39:18.095
it’s a miracle.

39:21.318 --> 39:23.775
it’s too much
of a coincidence for me.

39:26.448 --> 39:28.939
You accosted him with
your own golf club, r/ght?

39:29.034 --> 39:31.571
You scared him
into telling the truth.

39:31.662 --> 39:35.701
He admitted it.
He said he videotaped Dougie.

39:35.791 --> 39:37.907
But he refused
to credit Dougie.

39:38.001 --> 39:39.662

39:39.753 --> 39:41.994
You beat mm
with your golf club.

39:42.089 --> 39:45.752
And when the head broke off,
you stabbed him with it.

39:45.842 --> 39:49.300
The only thing my boy has
in this world, one thing—

39:49.388 --> 39:52.346

so I sort of understand.

40:28.051 --> 40:31.259
I can’t imagine you killing
someone for stealing credit
from Parker for anything.

40:31.346 --> 40:34.884
Well, not kill someone,
but— [ Chuckles]
threaten ’em.

40:34.975 --> 40:37.887
Even about something
as frivolous as bragging rights
to a video game?

40:40.272 --> 40:42.888
All right. How— How do we
choose who goes first?

40:43.025 --> 40:45.186
Right. Okay. Go ahead.
You go first.
Why?

It’s how the son feels.

Well, we’re discussing
the murder again?

40:56.663 --> 41:01.407
Someone breaks
your kid’s heart, you know,
your own heart rises up,

41:01.501 --> 41:03.787
gets fierce.

41:03.879 --> 41:05.870
Just a natural response.

41:07.257 --> 41:09.373
There’s a flaw
in your reasoning.

41:11.219 --> 41:14.006
I believe that due to
my superior learning curve,

41:14.097 --> 41:16.474
I can beat you at this game,
despite your superlative
strength...

41:16.558 --> 41:18.640
and your
remarkable reflexes.

41:18.727 --> 41:21.343
Well, how—
how do I start the game?

41:21.438 --> 41:24.180
What’s the flaw
in my reasoning?

41:24.274 --> 41:28.358
Well, Dougie Seeger’s autistic.

41:28.445 --> 41:32.438
He didn’t care.
His heart wasn’t broken.

41:32.532 --> 41:34.818
So the dad loved him
twice as much.

41:34.910 --> 41:37.617
All right. You don’t like
the reasoning, my math.

41:39.081 --> 41:42.323
I’ve realized recently that you
use a different number system,

41:42.417 --> 41:45.830
like the Babylonians,
which was base-60.

41:45.921 --> 41:50.085
