04:55.160 --> 04:56.422
LOOK, I'M BUSY,
ALRIGHT ?

04:56.430 --> 04:58.455
MY WORKLOAD HAS DOUBLED
SINCE FEDERICO'S GONE.

04:58.460 --> 05:00.155
YOU CAN'T EXPECT ME TO
ENGAGE YOU IN SMALL TALK

05:00.160 --> 05:02.924
JUST TO MAKE YOU
FEEL BE'I'I'ER.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.059
YOU FLUNKED
THE LICENSING TEST.

05:08.060 --> 05:09.652
DID YOU THINK
I DIDN'T KNOW

05:09.660 --> 05:11.093
THE GRADES WERE
BEING POSTED TODAY ?

05:11.100 --> 05:12.158
I DIDN'T.

05:12.160 --> 05:14.720
YOU DIDN'T
APPLY YOURSELF.

05:14.730 --> 05:16.391
YOU THINK THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE DO

05:16.400 --> 05:17.822
WHEN THEY CAN'T
DO ANYTHING ELSE.

05:17.830 --> 05:19.297
AND THEREFORE, IT CAN'T
BE THAT DIFFICULT.

05:19.300 --> 05:20.756
OKAY, I FEEL PRE'ITY
BAD RIGHT NOW.

05:20.760 --> 05:22.022
IS IT REALLY IMPORTANT
TO MAKE ME FEEL WORSE ?

05:22.030 --> 05:23.122
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU FEEL.

05:23.130 --> 05:24.791
OH, BULLSHIT, YOU LIKE
IT WHEN I FEEL BAD

05:24.800 --> 05:26.859
BECAUSE MISERY
LOVES COMPANY.

05:34.130 --> 05:35.529
HOW'D HE DIE ?

05:35.530 --> 05:37.657
H EART ATTACK.

05:37.660 --> 05:39.855
FELL DOWN A FLIGHT OF STAIRS,
DEAD WHEN HE HIT THE BOTTOM.

05:39.860 --> 05:41.691
HIS NOSE SUPPOSED TO
LOOK LIKE THAT ?

05:41.700 --> 05:43.156
OF COURSE NOT.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.299
I HAVE TO FINISH
EMBALMING HIM

05:45.300 --> 05:47.291
BEFORE I CAN START ON
ANYTHING COSMETIC.

05:47.300 --> 05:48.790
( doorbell )

05:48.800 --> 05:51.291
LOOK, I CAN DEAL
WITH WHOEVER IT IS.

05:51.300 --> 05:53.598
UNLESS IT'S
A WALK-IN.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.693
I JUST WANT
TO POINT OUT

05:55.700 --> 05:56.997
THAT YOU ARE CHOOSING
TO BE THE VICTIM HERE.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.150
I COULD HANDLE AN INTAKE
AND YOU KNOW IT.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.024
( male )
LADIES,
TAKE UP CHANGE.

06:11.630 --> 06:14.724
AND WALK TO
THE MIDDLE AND BACK.

06:16.260 --> 06:17.796
ALRIGHT, VERY GOOD.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.449
VERY GOOD,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

06:19.460 --> 06:21.690
SO, WE'LL SEE YOU ALL AT
THE SAME TIME NEXT WEEK, OKAY ?

06:21.700 --> 06:22.951
BE SAFE
GETTING HOME.

06:22.960 --> 06:24.791
MORNING, FOLKS.

06:24.800 --> 06:25.926
HI.

06:25.930 --> 06:27.124
HI.

06:27.130 --> 06:28.825
( doorbell )

06:28.830 --> 06:30.991
GODDAMNIT, WHY HASN'T
ANYONE ANSWERED THE DOOR ?

06:31.000 --> 06:32.422
WHERE IS MOM ?

06:33.260 --> 06:35.592
OKAY, IF YOU HAVEN'T
SLEPT WITH THAT GUY YET,

06:35.600 --> 06:36.953
WOULD YOU START ?

06:36.960 --> 06:39.019
BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD
DO YOU A WORLD OF GOOD.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.123
( gasping )

06:51.130 --> 06:52.950
DON'T DO THAT.

06:52.960 --> 06:54.427
DO WHAT ?

06:54.430 --> 06:55.897
WATCH ME
LIKE THAT.

06:55.900 --> 06:58.198
I CAN'T HELP IT,
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.452
OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE.

07:00.460 --> 07:02.758
I WANT TO GO
CAMPING AGAIN.

07:02.760 --> 07:04.250
THEN GO CAMPING.

07:04.260 --> 07:05.352
WITH YOU.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.328
I'VE GOT
A JOB NOW, HIRAM.

07:07.330 --> 07:10.822
I CAN'T JUST UP AND LEAVE
WHENEVER I FEEL LIKE IT.

07:10.830 --> 07:13.754
SPRING IS A VERY BUSY
TIME OF THE YEAR.

07:13.760 --> 07:16.251
IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY
TOMORROW.

07:18.560 --> 07:22.098
THE FIRST TIME WE WENT CAMPING
WAS TWO YEARS AGO, TOMORROW.

07:22.100 --> 07:24.193
WE DON'T HAVE
AN NIVERSARIES.

07:24.200 --> 07:27.829
I NEVER AGREED
TO ANNIVERSARIES.

07:27.830 --> 07:30.094
JUST YOU AND ME,
ALONE IN THE WOODS.

07:30.100 --> 07:31.590
NAKED, UNDER THE STARS.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.693
JUST LIKE IT WAS
AT THE BEGINNING.

07:33.700 --> 07:37.750
TOMORROW IS SUCH
SHORT NOTICE.

07:39.260 --> 07:40.693
I CAN'T PROMISE
ANYTHING.

07:40.700 --> 07:42.588
BUT I'LL TRY.

07:49.430 --> 07:50.920
UM...

07:50.930 --> 07:53.819
MY MOM WANTS TO KNOW HOW
QUICKLY WE CAN DO THIS.

07:53.830 --> 07:57.596
AH, WELL, I'D SUGGEST
A VIEWING IN TWO DAYS,

07:57.600 --> 07:59.795
TO ALLOW PROPER
RESTORATION.

08:01.230 --> 08:02.925
VIEWING ?

08:02.930 --> 08:04.852
FOR FRIENDS, FAMILY.

08:04.860 --> 08:07.351
YOU CAN MAKE IT AS SMALL
OR AS LARGE AS YOU WISH.

08:07.360 --> 08:10.193
NO, I CAN'T SEE
HIM IN A BOX.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.895
I CAN'T.

08:12.930 --> 08:13.726
ALRIGHT.

08:19.830 --> 08:23.493
MS. DIMAS, SEEING YOUR SON
BEFORE YOU BURY HIM

08:23.500 --> 08:25.195
MIGHT HELP YOU LET GO--

08:25.200 --> 08:27.828
NO, I DON'T WANT
TO SEE HIM !

08:29.030 --> 08:30.497
OF COURSE.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.127
WE'LL ARRANGE FOR
A CLOSED CASKET CEREMONY.

08:32.130 --> 08:35.850
WILL THREE DAYS
GIVE YOU ENOUGH TIME ?

08:42.030 --> 08:44.419
YEAH, THAT'S GONNA
BE FINE.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.229
NATE WILL SHOW
YOU TO THE DOOR.

08:52.230 --> 08:54.448
THAN KS.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.558
WHAT HAPPENED ?

09:02.560 --> 09:06.656
SIX-YEAR-OLD FOUND A GUN,
WAS PLAYING WITH IT.

09:06.660 --> 09:08.890
OH, JESUS.

09:08.900 --> 09:09.889
YEAH.

09:11.800 --> 09:12.926
UM...

09:16.000 --> 09:19.424
THEY GAVE ME THIS
AT THE HOSPITAL.

09:19.430 --> 09:22.422
IT'S SOME SORT
OF RECEIPT.

09:22.430 --> 09:25.490
I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU NEED IT, BUT...

09:35.700 --> 09:37.918
WHAT WAS
HE DOING HERE ?

09:40.760 --> 09:42.296
GABE.

09:43.030 --> 09:44.918
IT'S OKAY.

09:46.900 --> 09:48.390
HEY.

09:48.400 --> 09:51.654
MY BROTHER
JUST TOLD ME.

09:51.660 --> 09:54.891
I'M SO SORRY.

09:56.230 --> 09:57.754
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO GO.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.159
MY GRANDMOTHER'S
FUNERAL WAS HERE.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.993
YEAH, OF COURSE.

10:06.300 --> 10:09.519
MY MOM'S WAITING FOR ME
TO UNLOCK THE CAR.

10:22.030 --> 10:23.691
I THOUGHT WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE

10:23.700 --> 10:24.928
TO HAVE A VIEWING.

10:24.930 --> 10:27.990
SOMETIMES PEOPLE
DON'T WANT THAT.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.254
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T WANT
TO WORK ANY HARDER.

10:33.230 --> 10:34.788
WHEN FACED WITH THE OPTION
OF NOT HAVING TO RESTORE

10:34.800 --> 10:36.825
A SIX-YEAR-OLD CHILD'S HEAD
THAT'S BEEN BLOWN TO BITS ?

10:36.830 --> 10:38.627
YEAH, I DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT, DO YOU ?

10:38.630 --> 10:41.019
IT'S NOT OUR JOB TO FORCE
SOMEONE TO DO SOMETHING

10:41.030 --> 10:42.520
THEY'RE CLEARLY
NOT READY TO DO

10:42.530 --> 10:44.350
BECAUSE WE THINK
IT'S THE RIGHT THING.

10:44.360 --> 10:47.329
BECAUSE IT WILL
MAKE US FEEL BETTER.

10:54.700 --> 10:56.588
CAN I HELP YOU ?

10:56.600 --> 10:58.352
ROSES ARE IF YOU
LOVE SOMEBODY, RIGHT ?

10:58.360 --> 10:59.918
ROSES ARE
THE CLASSIC CHOICE,

10:59.930 --> 11:02.455
BUT OTHER FLOWERS COULD
ACHIEVE THE SAME EFFECT.

11:02.460 --> 11:05.099
WHAT IF YOU WERE GONNA
ASK HER TO MARRY YOU ?

11:05.100 --> 11:07.318
OH, HOW LOVELY.

11:07.330 --> 11:10.197
WELL, ROSES WOULD BE
THE PERFECT CHOICE.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.896
BUT SHE TURNED OUT TO
BE A CHEATING COWARD

11:12.900 --> 11:15.425
AND RAN OFF WITH
SOME SHITHEAD

11:15.430 --> 11:17.455
THAT SHE MET
IN TRAFFIC SCHOOL.

11:17.460 --> 11:19.724
WHAT COLOR WOULD
YOU GIVE A COWARD ?

11:19.730 --> 11:20.856
AH...

11:20.860 --> 11:22.157
YELLOW.

11:22.160 --> 11:23.627
YELLOW.

11:23.630 --> 11:27.157
GREAT, 12 DOZEN YELLOW ROSES
SENT TO THIS ADDRESS, PLEASE.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.719
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
THE CARD TO SAY ?

11:31.730 --> 11:33.288
"FUCK YOU, CUNT".

11:36.660 --> 11:39.356
I THINK IT WOULD BE MORE
PERSONAL IF YOU WRITE THAT.

11:46.130 --> 11:47.222
YES.

11:47.230 --> 11:48.527
YES.

11:48.530 --> 11:50.395
I HAVE TO TAKE THE DAY OFF
TOMORROW AND SATURDAY.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.890
WHY ?

11:51.900 --> 11:54.255
A FRIEND, I WAS SUPPOSED
TO HAVE PLANS WITH A FRIEND

11:54.260 --> 11:55.352
AND I FORGOT.

11:55.360 --> 11:58.727
IS IT WITH
THAT MAN ?

11:58.730 --> 12:01.119
THE ONE WITH THE FUNNY
LITTLE CAR WHO PICKS YOU UP ?

12:01.130 --> 12:04.327
IT'S AN ELECTRIC CAR AND IT'S
VERY GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.

12:04.330 --> 12:06.059
( laughing )

12:07.660 --> 12:09.150
WHY ARE YOU
LAUGHING ?

12:09.160 --> 12:10.559
BECAUSE YOU
ARE NOT.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.892
YOU LIKE THIS MAN ?

12:12.900 --> 12:14.299
CAN I HAVE THE DAYS
OFF OR NOT ?

12:14.300 --> 12:15.892
TAKE, G0,
I DON'T CARE.

12:15.900 --> 12:18.698
WE WILL
MISS YOU.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.220
BEEP, BEEP.

12:23.230 --> 12:25.152
( laughing )

12:31.360 --> 12:33.396
BRENDA ?

12:33.400 --> 12:34.799
HEY, THERE.

12:34.800 --> 12:38.099
I'LL BE RIGHT OUT, I JUST
GOT OUT OF THE SHOWER.

12:40.230 --> 12:41.993
HOW WAS WORK ?

12:42.000 --> 12:43.558
IT SUCKED.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.925
LIKE I FIGURED, I FAILED
THAT FUNERAL DIRECTOR'S TEST.

12:50.930 --> 12:53.797
THERE WAS THIS INTAKE
MEETING THIS MORNING

12:53.800 --> 12:55.893
I TOTALLY FUCKED UP.

12:57.430 --> 13:00.024
AND I JUST PICKED UP A DEAD
SIX-YEAR-OLD AT THE MORGUE.

13:01.560 --> 13:04.097
ALL IN ALL, IT'S BEEN
A PRETTY BAD DAY.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.791
GODDAMNIT !

13:10.800 --> 13:12.859
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE
I DON'T HAVE ANY FUCKING IDEA

13:12.860 --> 13:14.191
WHAT I'M DOING.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.998
IT'S LIKE I MADE THIS
BULLSHIT DECISION

13:17.000 --> 13:18.797
TO GO INTO THIS BUSINESS
FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS

13:18.800 --> 13:20.324
AND NOW
IT'S TOO LATE.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.659
IT'S NEVER
TOO LATE.

13:26.660 --> 13:28.651
JESUS, BILLY.

13:28.660 --> 13:30.992
WHAT, DO YOU
LIVE HERE NOW ?

13:31.000 --> 13:33.651
NO, BRENDA JUST GIVE
ME A SHIATSU.

13:33.660 --> 13:35.218
I'VE BEEN KINDA
TENSE LATELY.

13:35.230 --> 13:39.291
SO, BAD DAY, HUH ?

13:39.300 --> 13:40.699
YEAH.

13:40.700 --> 13:43.351
WELL, I'VE HAD
MY SHARE OF THOSE.

13:43.360 --> 13:45.555
I DON'T
DOUBT THAT.

13:45.560 --> 13:46.959
I DON'T REALLY
FEEL LIKE COOKING,

13:46.960 --> 13:50.054
SO, YOU GUYS DECIDE WHAT
WE'RE HAVING DELIVERED.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.248
THAT SHIT WAS
ALL OVER THE NEWS.

13:55.260 --> 13:56.727
SIX YEARS OLD,
RIGHT ?

13:56.730 --> 13:58.425
FUCK.

13:58.430 --> 14:01.490
SOME PEOPLE SHOULD JUST NOT
BE ALLOWED TO HAVE KIDS.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.058
HMM.

14:03.060 --> 14:05.949
SHE JUST SAT THERE
LIKE A GHOST.

14:08.260 --> 14:09.818
LIKE SHE'D
BEEN ERASED.

14:09.830 --> 14:13.049
I FELT SO
FUCKING HELPLESS.

14:14.360 --> 14:17.659
GOD, THAT POOR WOMAN.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.025
IN NIGERIA, THERE'S
THIS TRIBE THAT,

14:26.030 --> 14:27.998
WHEN A BABY DIES, THEY THROW
THE BODY INTO THE BUSH.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.319
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE
IF BURIED

14:29.330 --> 14:30.854
THE DEAD INFANT WOULD
OFFEND THE EARTH GODS,

14:30.860 --> 14:33.397
WHICH BRING
FERTILITY AND FOOD.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.493
THEN THERE'S
THE CHINESE,

14:35.500 --> 14:37.798
THAT CONSIDER THE DEATH
OF A CHILD "A BAD DEATH",

14:37.800 --> 14:38.949
WHERE THE PARENTS
AND GRANDPARENTS

14:38.960 --> 14:40.393
AREN'T EXPECTED TO
GO TO THE FUNERAL.

14:40.400 --> 14:43.494
OR THE BALINESE MOTHER WHO IS
COUNSELED TO REMAIN CHEERFUL

14:43.500 --> 14:45.627
AFTER THE DEATH OF HER INFANT
BECAUSE GRIEF MAKES

14:45.630 --> 14:47.120
ONE VULNERABLE TO...

14:47.130 --> 14:50.327
ILLNESS AND
MALEVOLENT DEMONS.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.752
WELL, THAT WAS
IN FORMATIVE.

14:59.730 --> 15:01.459
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S
LINE OF WORK.

15:01.460 --> 15:03.121
WHAT A MAN DOES IS...

15:03.130 --> 15:05.189
WELL, IT'S WHO HE IS.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.293
RIGHT, NATE ?

15:09.700 --> 15:11.190
AH, YEAH.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.327
A MAN SHOULD KNOW THE HISTORY
OF HIS CHOSEN PROFESSION

15:13.330 --> 15:15.855
IF HE EXPECTS TO BE
ANYTHING BUT AN AMATEUR.

15:15.860 --> 15:17.851
SO, I'M AN AMATEUR.

15:17.860 --> 15:20.294
I PREFER THE TERM
DILETTANTE.

15:20.300 --> 15:21.858
AND WHAT
ARE YOU, BILLY ?

15:21.860 --> 15:23.293
RUNNING AROUND
WITH YOUR CAMERA,

15:23.300 --> 15:25.188
TAKING PICTURES OF
OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES ?

15:25.200 --> 15:26.622
BOYS.

15:26.630 --> 15:27.995
YOU REALLY THINK
KNOWING A BUNCH OF

15:28.000 --> 15:29.490
ARCANE NATIONAL
GEOGRAPHIC SHIT

15:29.500 --> 15:31.889
IS GONNA HELP ME COPE
WITH A SIX-YEAR-OLD

15:31.900 --> 15:33.595
WHO SHOT HIMSELF
IN THE HEAD ?

15:39.100 --> 15:40.556
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE PLENTY
OF PLACES IN THE WORLD

15:40.560 --> 15:42.357
WHERE A KID DYING
IS PRETTY COMMON,

15:42.360 --> 15:44.225
BUT WE CAN'T
DEAL WITH IT.

15:44.230 --> 15:46.755
BECAUSE A DEAD CHILD IS
THE GREATEST FAILURE

15:46.760 --> 15:49.820
OF A CULTURE THAT BELIEVES IT'S
REVERSED THE ORDER OF NATURE.

15:49.830 --> 15:52.993
THIS WAS AN ACCIDENT,
THIS WASN'T NATURE.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.456
YOU KNOW WHAT
I FIND INTERESTING ?

15:54.460 --> 15:57.099
IF YOU LOSE A SPOUSE...

15:57.100 --> 16:00.194
YOU'RE CALLED A WIDOW
OR A WIDOWER.

16:00.200 --> 16:03.749
IF YOU'RE A CHILD
AND YOU LOSE YOUR PARENTS,

16:03.760 --> 16:05.819
THEN YOU'RE
AN ORPHAN.

16:05.830 --> 16:08.799
BUT WHAT'S THE WORD
TO DESCRIBE A PARENT

16:08.800 --> 16:11.394
WHO LOSES A CHILD ?

16:13.100 --> 16:16.752
I GUESS THAT'S JUST TOO FUCKING
AWFUL TO EVEN HAVE A NAME.

16:27.560 --> 16:29.699
( dance music playing )

16:38.130 --> 16:40.098
I WAS WORRIED
YOU WEREN'T GONNA SHOW.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.352
NO, I JUST GOT
TIED UP AT WORK.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.123
BELIEVE ME, I NEED THIS,
AFTER THE DAY I HAD.

16:44.130 --> 16:45.427
THIS OUGHT TO HELP.

16:45.430 --> 16:46.624
OH, WHAT IS IT ?

16:46.630 --> 16:47.824
"X", ECSTASY.

16:47.830 --> 16:48.922
YOU'VE NEVER
DONE IT.

16:48.930 --> 16:50.397
AH, NO, CAN'T SAY
THAT I HAVE.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.095
YOU'RE GONNA
LOVE IT.

16:54.060 --> 16:55.891
ARE YOU GOING TO
TAKE ONE TOO ?

16:55.900 --> 16:57.788
I'M ALREADY THERE,
LET'S DANCE.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.427
I'M NOT A VERY
GOOD DANCER.

16:59.430 --> 17:00.920
YOU WILL BE.

17:11.230 --> 17:15.291
DAVID, DAVID, HERE,
YOU GOTTA KEEP DRINKING THIS.

17:48.660 --> 17:50.651
( female )
SHE WAS ONLY 63.

17:50.660 --> 17:53.424
THAT'S SO YOUNG.

17:54.860 --> 17:56.555
ISN'T THAT YOUNG ?

17:58.330 --> 18:00.195
MRS. LAWSON, HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT WHAT KIND OF FUNERAL

18:00.200 --> 18:01.656
YOU'D LIKE FOR
YOUR MOTHER ?

18:04.260 --> 18:05.750
IT HAS TO
BE BEAUTIFUL.

18:05.760 --> 18:08.627
IT HAS TO BE
BEAUTIFUL.

18:12.230 --> 18:14.027
WELL, WE CAN OFFER YOU
A WIDE VARIETY OF SERVICES

18:14.030 --> 18:17.056
RANGING FROM SIMPLE
TO MORE FORMAL.

18:17.060 --> 18:19.893
TO ANYTHING
YOU MIGHT NEED.

18:22.130 --> 18:24.257
YES, ANYTHING AT ALL.

18:27.260 --> 18:29.091
( sobbing )

18:35.260 --> 18:36.852
IT'S A GOOD THING
I WAS THERE, YOU KNOW ?

18:36.860 --> 18:38.396
I MEAN, GABE WAS
SO WRECKED.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.527
I WAS THE ONE WHO HAD
TO TRASH HIS WEED.

18:40.530 --> 18:42.498
SERIOUSLY, IF THE POLICE
FOUND THAT SHIT,

18:42.500 --> 18:44.297
IT'D BE WAY WORSE,
YOU KNOW ?

18:44.300 --> 18:45.619
HEY.
HEY, ANDY.

18:45.630 --> 18:47.154
HOW'S GABE ?

18:47.160 --> 18:48.991
HE'S OKAY,
I GUESS.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.797
WELL, HAVE YOU
TALKED TO HIM ?

18:50.800 --> 18:52.927
NOT REALLY.

18:52.930 --> 18:56.525
WELL, ARE YOU
GONNA SEE HIM LATER ?

18:56.530 --> 18:59.988
I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S REAL WEIRD
OVER THERE.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.355
THE MOTHER'S
LIKE ALL FREAKED.

19:02.360 --> 19:04.419
YEAH, BUT
WHAT ABOUT GABE ?

19:04.430 --> 19:07.126
LOOK, MORTICIA,
I'M NOT INTERFERING.

19:07.130 --> 19:09.052
IT'S TOO MUCH TO
GET INTO, YOU KNOW ?

19:09.060 --> 19:12.154
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE HIS FRIEND.

19:12.160 --> 19:13.752
WHY DON'T YOU
FUCK OFF, BITCH, HUH ?

19:13.760 --> 19:16.320
ANYWAY, IF YOU'RE
SO WORRIED

19:16.330 --> 19:17.695
WHY DON'T YOU GO
FUCK HIM AGAIN ?

19:17.700 --> 19:19.190
MAYBE THAT'LL
CHEER HIM UP.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.919
NICE, THAT'S NICE.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.158
YEAH.

19:24.160 --> 19:27.926
BY THE WAY, PARKER TOLD ME
HOW ONE OF YOUR TESTICLES

19:27.930 --> 19:30.626
IS LIKE FREAKISHLY SMALL,
LIKE A PEANUT.

19:32.430 --> 19:34.489
( laughing )

19:35.760 --> 19:36.897
( female )
IS THAT TRUE ?

19:36.900 --> 19:38.026
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.322
UGH.

20:05.000 --> 20:05.989
FOR LATER.

20:11.730 --> 20:13.595
YOU HAVE
A HEADACHE, DEAR ?

20:13.600 --> 20:16.728
AH, YEAH, I,
I THOUGHT I DID.

20:16.730 --> 20:20.097
I'M THROWING IN A LOAD OF
LAUNDRY IF YOU NEED SOME DONE.

20:21.730 --> 20:24.722
BY THE WAY, I'M GOING CAMPING
WITH HIRAM THIS WEEKEND.

20:24.730 --> 20:26.550
I'M LEAVING
THIS AFTERNOON.

20:26.560 --> 20:27.697
GREAT.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.725
I'M DOING
WHITES FIRST.

20:34.160 --> 20:36.492
AW, FUCK, DAVID.

20:36.500 --> 20:37.819
DAVID.

20:37.830 --> 20:39.559
DAVID.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.528
DAVID !

20:41.530 --> 20:43.054
DAVID !

20:43.060 --> 20:44.891
ARE YOU ALRIGHT ?

20:44.900 --> 20:46.049
YOU LOOK PALE.

20:46.060 --> 20:47.459
NO, I'M FINE.

20:47.460 --> 20:49.826
JUST A HEADACHE,
THAT'S ALL.

20:55.900 --> 20:58.323
OKAY, YOU'RE IN THIS LIKE,
TOTAL DANGER ZONE.

20:58.330 --> 21:00.355
GABE DIMAS
IS A DICK.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.555
I'M SORRY HIS
BROTHER'S DEAD,

21:02.560 --> 21:05.120
BUT DON'T THINK THAT MEANS
HE'S NOT A DICK.

21:05.130 --> 21:06.654
I JUST HAVEN'T
SEEN HIM AROUND.

21:06.660 --> 21:08.127
SO, I WAS WORRIED.

21:08.130 --> 21:09.950
YOU HOOK UP
WITH HIM NOW,

21:09.960 --> 21:12.224
IT GONNA BE LIKE TOTAL
EMOTIONAL RAPE.

21:12.230 --> 21:14.289
WHATEVER HE FEELS FOR YOU,
IS GONNA BE WRAPPED UP

21:14.300 --> 21:16.860
IN SOME GUILT GRIEF
FUCK FEST.

21:16.860 --> 21:19.693
YOU BETTER STAY AWAY
FROM THAT SHIT.

21:19.700 --> 21:21.827
I'M NOT KIDDING.

21:25.060 --> 21:27.221
( bell ringing )

21:29.200 --> 21:32.124
SO, YOU FAILED
A TEST, BIG WHOOP.

21:32.130 --> 21:34.325
YOU WANT TO BE HELPFUL
TO THE PEOPLE

21:34.330 --> 21:36.548
THAT WALK IN THROUGH
YOUR FRONT DOOR,

21:36.560 --> 21:39.028
SO, YOU HAVE TO BE
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.123
OKAY.

21:42.800 --> 21:46.019
I CHOSE THREE FUNERAL HOMES
FROM THE YELLOW PAGES AT RANDOM.

21:46.030 --> 21:48.419
I'VE ALWAYS FELT
AN UNCONTROLLED SAMPLE GROUP

21:48.430 --> 21:50.091
PROVIDES MORE
RELIABLE DATA.

21:50.100 --> 21:53.649
YOU WANT US TO PRETEND TO
BE PURCHASING A FUNERAL ?

21:53.660 --> 21:55.355
LOOK UP
THE FIRST ADDRESS.

21:55.360 --> 21:57.225
I THINK IT'S
IN SHERMAN OAKS.

21:57.230 --> 21:59.824
COME ON,
IT'LL BE FUN.

22:01.900 --> 22:03.322
( doorbell )

22:04.360 --> 22:07.397
( knocking )

22:10.330 --> 22:11.991
HELLO ?

22:13.030 --> 22:14.292
GABE ?

22:16.330 --> 22:17.752
IS ANYBODY HOME ?

22:20.900 --> 22:23.255
OH, MRS. DIMAS,
I'M SORRY.

22:23.260 --> 22:25.694
THE DOOR WAS OPEN.

22:27.500 --> 22:30.458
IS GABE AROUND ?

23:08.230 --> 23:10.118
WE CAN STILL LEAVE.

23:10.130 --> 23:11.449
WHY, WHAT ARE
YOU AFRAID OF ?

23:11.460 --> 23:13.826
UH, HUMILIATING MYSELF ?

23:13.830 --> 23:15.024
WASTING SOMEONE'S
VALUABLE TIME.

23:15.030 --> 23:16.452
DON'T BE
SO LEFT-BRAINED.

23:16.460 --> 23:18.394
( door closing )

23:20.430 --> 23:22.523
( sobbing )

23:26.700 --> 23:29.294
I'M SO SORRY TO
KEEP YOU WAITING.

23:29.300 --> 23:30.619
NOW...

23:30.630 --> 23:33.451
HOW CAN I HELP ?

23:35.730 --> 23:37.197
IT'S MY PARENTS.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.760
THEY WERE KILLED
THIS MORNING...

23:39.760 --> 23:43.389
IN AN ACCIDENT.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.153
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.720
IT WAS A...

23:48.730 --> 23:50.857
A HELICOPTER.

23:50.860 --> 23:52.896
IT WENT DOWN,

23:52.900 --> 23:54.527
THERE WAS
AN EXPLOSION.

23:54.530 --> 23:57.590
OH, GOD,
I CAN'T DO THIS.

23:57.600 --> 24:00.251
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

24:00.260 --> 24:03.889
THEY WERE IN THE PRIME
OF THEIR LIVES.

24:05.800 --> 24:07.688
EVERYBODY DIES,
WE ALL DIE,

24:07.700 --> 24:10.089
EVERYTHING WE EVER CARE
ABOUT WILL DISAPPEAR,

24:10.100 --> 24:12.625
SO, WHAT'S THE FUCKING
POINT OF LIVING ?!

24:18.260 --> 24:19.659
AH...

24:19.660 --> 24:23.221
CAN I SUGGEST
MATCHING CASKETS ?

24:25.330 --> 24:27.719
THAT'S IT ?

24:27.730 --> 24:29.493
THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO OFFER ME
IN MY TIME OF GRIEF,

24:29.500 --> 24:30.751
MERCHANDISE ?

24:30.760 --> 24:32.352
WE HAVE NOTHING
TO LEARN HERE.

24:39.560 --> 24:42.449
WATER PURIFIER, ROPE...

24:42.460 --> 24:43.893
BEAR BELL,

24:43.900 --> 24:46.391
FLASH LIGHT,

24:46.400 --> 24:49.028
TOILET PAPER AND YES,
IT'S BIODEGRADABLE,

24:49.030 --> 24:51.396
BIRD CALLER,
BINOCULARS. ..

24:51.400 --> 24:52.822
RUTH, I'M SURE
YOU HAVE EVERYTHING.

24:52.830 --> 24:54.695
IN FACT, I KNOW
YOU HAVE EVERYTHING.

24:54.700 --> 24:55.894
YOU ALWAYS DO.

24:55.900 --> 24:58.221
IT WOULDN'T BE MUCH FUN
TO GET ALL THE WAY UP THERE

24:58.230 --> 25:00.448
AND REALIZE WE FORGOT
THE MATCHES, NOW, WOULD IT ?

25:00.460 --> 25:01.722
OR...

25:01.730 --> 25:03.891
THE CHAMPAGNE.

25:03.900 --> 25:06.289
HIRAM, THAT'S JUST
DECADENT.

25:06.300 --> 25:08.495
WAS IT EXPENSIVE ?

25:08.500 --> 25:09.990
WE SHOULDN'T
WASTE IT.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.490
WASTE IT ?

25:11.500 --> 25:13.058
IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY.

25:13.060 --> 25:16.393
CLAIRE,
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

25:16.400 --> 25:18.925
YOU REMEMBER HIRAM.

25:20.430 --> 25:21.727
HI.

25:21.730 --> 25:23.925
HOW WAS SCHOOL ?

25:23.930 --> 25:25.420
I HAVE A HEADACHE.

25:36.700 --> 25:38.349
HIRAM AND I ARE
GOING CAMPING.

25:38.360 --> 25:41.124
YOUR DINNER'S
IN THE REFRIGERATOR

25:41.130 --> 25:43.018
AND I'LL BE
BACK TOMORROW.

25:45.500 --> 25:48.697
IT'S A VERY BEAUTIFUL
TIME OF THE YEAR.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.996
OKAY, WELL,
YOU TWO HAVE FUN.

26:01.260 --> 26:02.625
WE SHOULD
PROBABLY LEAVE

26:02.630 --> 26:04.928
IF WE WANT TO BEAT
THE RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC.

26:05.960 --> 26:07.291
RUTH ?

26:07.300 --> 26:09.359
HONEY, WHAT'S WRONG ?

26:09.360 --> 26:12.329
MY CHILDREN DON'T
NEED ME ANYMORE.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.628
LET'S THINK OF THIS
AS A...

26:19.630 --> 26:21.427
CELEBRATION

26:21.430 --> 26:23.648
OF YOUR UNCLE'S LIFE.

26:23.660 --> 26:26.128
NOW, THE TITAN IS
AN EXCELLENT CHOICE

26:26.130 --> 26:27.893
FOR A DISTINGUISHED
GENTLEMAN.

26:27.900 --> 26:29.856
IT'S SOLID MAHOGANY,
IT'S HAND-FINISHED.

26:29.860 --> 26:32.226
BURLWOOD AND
NICKEL ACCENTS.

26:32.230 --> 26:35.051
AND GRACE FIELD...

26:35.060 --> 26:38.791
GRACE FIELD IS A LOVELY
PLACE FOR INTERMENT.

26:38.800 --> 26:41.724
IT'S SERENE,
IT'S PASTORAL.

26:42.930 --> 26:44.192
HOW MUCH ?

26:44.200 --> 26:47.158
AFTER YOU SIGN THE CONTRACT,
WE TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.

26:47.160 --> 26:48.923
THERE'S NO WORRY.

26:48.930 --> 26:50.420
THERE'S NO PAIN.

26:50.430 --> 26:51.897
HOW...

26:51.900 --> 26:53.595
MUCH ?

26:53.600 --> 26:57.092
IT COMES TO JUST
UNDER $20,000.

26:57.100 --> 26:58.852
( laughing )

27:05.230 --> 27:08.393
YOU'RE CHARGING $12,000
FOR THE TITAN ?

27:08.400 --> 27:10.652
WHAT IS THAT,
LIKE A 300% MARKUP ?

27:10.660 --> 27:12.252
I COULD COME
DOWN TO 10.

27:14.660 --> 27:17.959
AND GRACE FIELD IS IN BETWEEN
A POWER STATION AND A FREEWAY.

27:17.960 --> 27:20.929
THERE ARE NICER
CEMETERIES.

27:20.930 --> 27:24.650
BUT THEY'RE JUST A LITTLE BIT
MORE EXPENSIVE.

27:25.730 --> 27:27.459
AH, NO THANKS.

27:29.630 --> 27:32.724
WE'LL TRY AND FIND
SOMEWHERE THAT DOESN'T
JUST WANT TO SWINDLE US.

27:36.160 --> 27:38.094
NICE TIE.

27:43.100 --> 27:44.897
THIS BUSINESS IS
A TOTAL RACKET.

27:44.900 --> 27:47.949
WHAT BUSINESS ISN'T ?

27:47.960 --> 27:51.418
SOMETIMES I WISH
I COULD BE THIS...

27:51.430 --> 27:53.159
COMPLETELY
SELFISH ASSHOLE

27:53.160 --> 27:54.388
THAT DIDN'T GIVE
A SHIT ABOUT ANYTHING.

27:54.400 --> 27:56.254
I COULD JUST WORK
AT SOME MINDLESS JOB

27:56.260 --> 27:58.057
THAT PAID ME
A FUCK-LOAD OF MONEY.

27:58.060 --> 27:59.823
NO, YOU DON'T.

27:59.830 --> 28:01.593
IT WOULD MAKE MY LIFE
A LOT EASIER.

28:01.600 --> 28:04.125
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR LIFE
TO BE EASY.

28:06.630 --> 28:08.325
( horn )

28:14.430 --> 28:16.159
GABE ?

28:17.860 --> 28:19.418
HI.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.951
I DIDN'T KNOW
IF ANYBODY WAS HOME.

28:25.200 --> 28:27.794
DID YOU RING
THE BELL ?

28:29.700 --> 28:33.420
I JUST CAME BY TO
DROP OFF THIS STUFF.

28:35.330 --> 28:36.490
OKAY.

28:36.500 --> 28:40.425
IT'S MY BROTHER'S
SOCCER CLOTH ES.

28:40.430 --> 28:42.819
I THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT
LIKE TO GET BURIED IN THEM.

28:42.830 --> 28:45.094
YOU THINK
THAT'S OKAY ?

28:46.560 --> 28:48.699
YEAH.

28:49.830 --> 28:51.718
I THINK THAT'S
REALLY NICE.

28:54.500 --> 28:55.751
I WENT TO
YOUR HOUSE.

28:57.860 --> 28:58.929
YOU SEE MY MOM ?

29:00.660 --> 29:01.251
YEAH.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.888
LIKE A ZOMBIE, HUH ?

29:05.900 --> 29:08.425
JUST SITS THERE.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.288
I DON'T KNOW WHY
SHE BLAMES HERSELF.

29:12.300 --> 29:13.995
IT'S MY FAULT,
I KILLED HIM.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.321
GABE, NO, IT WAS
AN ACCIDENT.

29:18.530 --> 29:20.657
IT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED
IF I'D BEEN WATCHING HIM.

29:23.460 --> 29:24.757
MY MOM CAN'T EVEN
FIND ANTHONY'S DAD

29:24.760 --> 29:26.159
TO TELL HIM
WHAT HAPPENED.

29:26.160 --> 29:27.798
PROBABLY MOVED.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.791
WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
IN LIKE TWO YEARS.

29:29.800 --> 29:32.155
THAT SUCKS.

29:32.760 --> 29:34.591
NAH, HE'S A FUCKING
DRUNKEN DIPSHIT.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.090
USED TO KICK MY ASS
ALL THE TIME

29:36.100 --> 29:37.328
JUST TO PROVE
THAT HE COULD.

29:41.130 --> 29:44.156
YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE WOULD
CALL YOU THOSE THINGS LIKE

29:44.160 --> 29:47.049
CEMETERY GIRL
AND VAMPIRA ?

29:47.060 --> 29:48.220
YEAH.

29:49.530 --> 29:51.191
I NEVER THOUGHT
THAT WAS FUNNY.

29:56.700 --> 29:57.928
I SHOULD GO.

29:57.930 --> 29:59.090
WOULD YOU JUST...

29:59.100 --> 30:01.591
MAKE SURE YOUR
BROTHER GETS THESE ?

30:01.600 --> 30:03.090
OF COURSE.

30:04.530 --> 30:07.988
HEY, LOOK, IF YOU NEED
ANYTHING, LIKE TO TALK

30:08.000 --> 30:09.729
OR SOMETHING...

30:09.730 --> 30:11.891
YOU CAN CALL ME.

30:11.900 --> 30:13.959
ALRIGHT.

30:23.700 --> 30:25.952
WHERE DO YOU WANT
TO HANG THE FOOD ?

30:25.960 --> 30:28.349
CAN'T IT WAIT
'TIL AFTER DINNER ?

30:28.360 --> 30:30.851
I'VE ALREADY TAKEN OUT
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO EAT.

30:30.860 --> 30:32.225
I'D RATHER
NOT RISK IT.

30:34.430 --> 30:36.022
WELL, I'M SORRY
IT'S INCONVENIENT.

30:36.030 --> 30:38.590
BUT WOULD YOU PREFER WE WERE
MAULED IN OUR SLEEP BY BEARS ?

30:38.600 --> 30:39.953
RUTH ?

30:39.960 --> 30:41.996
YOU NEED TO RELAX.

30:52.460 --> 30:55.395
HELLO, I'M ROSEMARY,
HOW CAN I HELP YOU ?

30:56.030 --> 30:57.224
UH, HI.

30:57.230 --> 30:58.595
I NEED TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS
FOR A FUNERAL.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.454
ALRIGHT.

31:01.730 --> 31:03.288
MY WIFE'S IN
THE RESTROOM.

31:03.300 --> 31:04.597
SHE'LL BE OUT
IN A MINUTE.

31:04.600 --> 31:05.692
FINE.

31:05.700 --> 31:07.952
CAN I ASK WHO
THE FUNERAL IS FOR ?

31:07.960 --> 31:10.099
IT'S FOR ME.

31:14.160 --> 31:17.948
BET YOU DON'T GET
TOO MANY PEOPLE SHOPPING
FOR THEIR OWN FUNERAL.

31:17.960 --> 31:19.848
IT HAPPENS.

31:19.860 --> 31:22.021
MOST PEOPLE WHO KNOW
THEY'RE GOING TO DIE

31:22.030 --> 31:23.622
WANT TO HAVE A SAY.

31:23.630 --> 31:26.121
PLANNING IT TOGETHER
WITH YOUR HUSBAND

31:26.130 --> 31:28.951
COULD BE A MEANINGFUL
PROCESS FOR YOU BOTH.

31:30.760 --> 31:32.990
IS IT CANCER ?

31:33.000 --> 31:34.649
YEAH.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.594
IT'S EVERYWHERE.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.522
LIVER NOW.

31:38.530 --> 31:40.088
BRENDA.

31:40.100 --> 31:43.149
MY HUSBAND HATES ME
DOING THIS.

31:43.160 --> 31:45.697
HE WANTS ME TO
SPEND THIS TIME

31:45.700 --> 31:47.656
DOING THINGS I ALWAYS
DREAMED OF

31:47.660 --> 31:50.390
BUT NEVER GAVE MYSELF
PERMISSION--

31:50.400 --> 31:52.721
( coughing )

31:56.860 --> 31:58.259
PARDON ME.

31:58.260 --> 32:00.854
THE COUGHING BLOOD
AND PISSING NEEDLES THING

32:03.100 --> 32:05.455
HE JUST WANTS YOU
TO BE HAPPY.

32:05.460 --> 32:08.850
HE JUST DOESN'T
WANT ME TO DIE.

32:10.330 --> 32:12.992
OKAY, IT'S JUST TOO FUCKED UP,
I CAN'T DO IT, I CAN'T.

32:15.130 --> 32:17.257
HE'S NOT READY.

32:17.260 --> 32:18.955
IT'S HARD FOR HIM.

32:18.960 --> 32:22.123
PROBABLY HARDER
THAN IT IS FOR YOU.

32:22.130 --> 32:24.098
THAT WAS LIKE
MAYBE THE MOST

32:24.100 --> 32:25.556
FUCKED UP THING
YOU'VE EVER DONE TO ME.

32:25.560 --> 32:26.720
SORRY.

32:26.730 --> 32:27.924
THAT WAS LIKE THE SHIT
YOU PULL ON THOSE DOCTORS

32:27.930 --> 32:28.919
IN THE CHARLOTTE BOOK.

32:28.930 --> 32:30.227
JUST TO GET A FUCKING
RISE OUT OF THEM.

32:30.230 --> 32:31.754
WHAT'S NEXT, YOU'RE GONNA
START BARKING AT ME ?

32:31.760 --> 32:33.091
I MIGHT, IF YOU DON'T
STOP YELLING AT ME.

32:33.100 --> 32:34.897
WHAT YOU DID JUST NOW
WAS NOT FUNNY !

32:34.900 --> 32:36.925
WELL, IT WASN'T
MEANT TO BE.

32:38.460 --> 32:42.396
YOU COUNSEL PEOPLE
ABOUT DEATH EVERY DAY, NATE,

32:42.400 --> 32:44.698
WHEN DEATH IS WHAT
YOU'RE MOST AFRAID OF.

32:44.700 --> 32:45.997
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THIS PICTURE ?

32:46.000 --> 32:47.319
OF COURSE
I'M AFRAID OF IT.

32:47.330 --> 32:48.695
WHAT SANE PERSON ISN'T ?

32:48.700 --> 32:49.849

32:49.860 --> 32:51.919
YEAH, WELL, I SAID,
"WHAT SANE PERSON ?"

32:51.930 --> 32:53.727
( barking )

32:58.160 --> 32:59.627
( laughing )

33:19.560 --> 33:21.619

33:24.100 --> 33:25.158
HELLO.

33:25.160 --> 33:26.559
HEY.

33:26.560 --> 33:28.494
HEY, WHAT'S UP ?

33:28.500 --> 33:30.297
Nothing, I just...

33:30.300 --> 33:32.256
I JUST WANTED TO
TALK TO SOMEBODY.

33:32.260 --> 33:34.399
Aw.

33:35.360 --> 33:36.850
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TONIGHT ?

33:36.860 --> 33:39.055
I DON'T KNOW,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

33:39.060 --> 33:40.254

33:45.330 --> 33:48.094
( banging noise )

33:53.230 --> 33:55.289
SHIT, FUCK !

33:55.300 --> 33:57.655

34:01.300 --> 34:03.291
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR ?

34:03.300 --> 34:04.858
ASPIRIN.

34:04.860 --> 34:06.452
I KNOW THERE WAS A BOTTLE
OF ASPIRIN IN HERE.

34:06.460 --> 34:08.792
YEAH, I TOOK

34:08.800 --> 34:11.394

ARE YOU OKAY ?

34:11.400 --> 34:14.699
YEAH, WHY ?

34:14.700 --> 34:16.099
YOU FOUND IT,
DIDN'T YOU ?

34:16.100 --> 34:17.590
YOU FOUND IT
AND KEPT IT FOR YOURSELF.

34:17.600 --> 34:20.649
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU ?

34:20.660 --> 34:22.059
NOTHING.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.255
YOU'RE WEARING
MY SHIRT.

34:24.260 --> 34:25.625
( horn )

34:25.630 --> 34:26.551
FUCK !

34:26.560 --> 34:28.357
WHAT IS THIS
LIKE A DATE ?

34:28.360 --> 34:29.793
UH, SORT OF.

34:29.800 --> 34:33.759
NO WAY, YOU'RE DATING
THE SQUARE DANCING GUY ?

34:33.760 --> 34:35.250
WEIRD.

34:35.260 --> 34:36.420
WEIRD WHY ?

34:36.430 --> 34:38.990
NO, I GET IT,
HE'S HOT.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.595
IN A KIND OF GENERIC
BANANA REPUBLIC KIND OF WAY.

34:42.600 --> 34:44.750
CLAIRE, I REALLY NEED
THAT ASPIRIN BOTTLE.

34:44.760 --> 34:47.695
DAVID, I REALLY
DON'T HAVE IT.

34:47.700 --> 34:50.260
WHAT WAS IN THERE ?

34:50.260 --> 34:52.558
HE GAVE ME
SOME PILLS

34:52.560 --> 34:54.892
AND NOW I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY,
"SORRY, I LOST THEM,

34:54.900 --> 34:57.892
"BECAUSE I'M THIS OLD GUY GEEK
AND I'M COMPLETELY UNCOOL

34:57.900 --> 35:00.289
"IN THIS WORLD IN WHICH
YOU SEEM TO THRIVE,

35:00.300 --> 35:03.121
YOU PERFECT DISTILLATION
OF HUMAN EVOLUTION."

35:05.760 --> 35:07.398
OKAY, IS THIS SPLIT
PERSONALITY THING

35:07.400 --> 35:09.823
LIKE SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS
WHEN MOM GOES OUT OF TOWN ?

35:09.830 --> 35:13.618
BECAUSE I LIKE YOU
LIKE THIS WAY BETTER.

35:13.630 --> 35:15.325
( horn )

35:17.730 --> 35:19.357
DINNER WAS
DELICIOUS.

35:19.360 --> 35:22.625
FOOD JUST TASTES
BETTER OUTDOORS.

35:22.630 --> 35:25.997
YOU REMEMBER WHAT WE ATE
THE FIRST TIME WE WENT CAMPING ?

35:26.000 --> 35:27.126
NO.

35:27.130 --> 35:29.496
PORK CHOPS WITH
FIRE-ROASTED VEGETABLES.

35:29.500 --> 35:31.297
OH, YES.

35:31.300 --> 35:33.518
THE SKY WAS SO
CLEAR THAT NIGHT.

35:33.530 --> 35:36.055
JUST LIKE TONIGHT.

35:36.060 --> 35:37.948
DID YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO GO CAMPING

35:37.960 --> 35:39.621
IF YOU'RE
MENSTRUATING ?

35:39.630 --> 35:40.722
WHAT ?

35:40.730 --> 35:41.822
IT'S TRUE.

35:41.830 --> 35:43.957
MY HUSBAND BURIED
A YOUNG WOMAN ONCE.

35:43.960 --> 35:47.953
SHE WENT ON A CAMPING TRIP,
SHE WAS MENSTRUATING

35:47.960 --> 35:50.099
AND A BEAR SMELLED THE BLOOD AND
KILLED HER IN HER SLEEPING BAG.

35:50.100 --> 35:52.318
KILLED ONE OF
HER FRIENDS, TOO.

35:52.330 --> 35:54.218
BUT WE ONLY
BURIED HER.

35:54.230 --> 35:57.290
NOT THE FRIEND.

35:58.830 --> 35:59.990
HUH.

36:03.400 --> 36:05.095
I'M GLAD WE'RE SEEING
EACH OTHER AGAIN.

36:05.100 --> 36:07.398
MM-HMM, ME TOO.

36:07.400 --> 36:09.527
IT'S NICE.

36:10.060 --> 36:11.425
WHAT'S WRONG ?

36:11.430 --> 36:14.354
I'VE GOT A LITTLE
BIT OF A HEADACHE.

36:27.900 --> 36:29.094
I'M SORRY I FORGOT
THOSE PILLS.

36:29.100 --> 36:30.988
THAT'S NO BIG DEAL.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.991
YOU CAN BE
MY DRUG TONIGHT.

36:36.230 --> 36:38.528
SO, WHAT'S WITH THE GUY
WHO'S BEEN STARING AT YOU

36:38.530 --> 36:39.997
SINCE WE GOT HERE ?

36:47.460 --> 36:48.222
SHIT.

36:48.230 --> 36:49.026
THAT'S KEITH.

36:49.030 --> 36:49.894
WE DATED.

36:49.900 --> 36:51.049
HE'S PRETTY HOT.

36:51.060 --> 36:52.197
YOU GUYS
STILL FRIENDS ?

36:52.200 --> 36:53.394
AH, NOT REALLY.

36:53.400 --> 36:55.152
WHY NOT ? I'M FRIENDS
WITH MY EXES.

36:55.160 --> 36:57.549
WHY DOESN'T THAT
SURPRISE ME ?

36:57.560 --> 36:59.551
HE'S COMING OVER.

36:59.560 --> 37:01.289
IS HE INTO
THREE-WAYS ?

37:01.300 --> 37:04.053
LOOK, HE'S A COP, SO DON'T
MENTION THE DRUGS OR ANYTHING.

37:04.060 --> 37:06.449
SURE, DAD.

37:06.460 --> 37:08.223
DAVID.

37:08.230 --> 37:09.754
KEITH, HI,
HOW'S IT GOING ?

37:09.760 --> 37:11.728
GOOD, IT'S
GOING GOOD.

37:11.730 --> 37:14.858
THIS IS THE LAST PLACE
I'D EVER EXPECT TO SEE YOU.

37:14.860 --> 37:16.896
YEAH, WELL,
IT WAS KURT'S IDEA.

37:16.900 --> 37:18.219
KURT, THIS IS KEITH.

37:18.230 --> 37:19.254
HEY.

37:19.260 --> 37:20.329
HI.

37:20.330 --> 37:23.197
KURT TEACH ES
SQUARE DANCING.

37:23.200 --> 37:26.158
I TRIED TO GET DAVID TO GO
DANCING WITH ME THE WHOLE TIME

37:26.160 --> 37:27.627
WE WERE TOGETHER.

37:27.630 --> 37:29.552
TOLD ME HE DIDN'T
EVEN LIKE TO DANCE.

37:31.300 --> 37:32.358
THAN KS.

37:33.400 --> 37:35.857
EDDIE, THIS IS
DAVID, AND...

37:35.860 --> 37:38.693
KURT, HI.

37:38.700 --> 37:40.691
HI.

37:43.630 --> 37:45.450
SO, HOW'D YOU

37:45.460 --> 37:46.950
EDDIE'S AN EMT.

37:46.960 --> 37:48.518
WE MET ON THE JOB.

37:48.530 --> 37:49.997
NEWLYWEDS IN
A CAR CRASH.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.697
HE SAVED THE BRIDE
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.657
WHAT ABOUT
THE GROOM ?

37:56.660 --> 37:58.958
DIDN'T MAKE IT.

37:58.960 --> 38:01.394
WOW, SO, THE BRIDE HAD ETERNITY
WITH THE MAN SHE LOVED

38:01.400 --> 38:03.129
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER
AND THEN YOU GO AND SAVE HER

38:03.130 --> 38:05.018
AND SHE ENDS UP
LEFT BEHIND ALONE.

38:05.030 --> 38:06.622
( laughing )

38:08.800 --> 38:10.529
THAT'S ONE WAY
OF LOOKING AT IT.

38:13.860 --> 38:15.418
WELL, IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

38:15.430 --> 38:18.729
YEAH, NICE MEETING YOU.

38:18.730 --> 38:20.527

38:27.330 --> 38:29.821
WELL, OF COURSE HE'S DATING
MR. FUCKING SUPER GUY E.R.

38:29.830 --> 38:31.297
I BET THEY

38:31.300 --> 38:32.858
I MEAN WITH
THE UNIFORMS AND ALL.

38:32.860 --> 38:36.455
YOU KNOW, I DATED A COP ONCE,
TOTAL CONTROL FREAK.

38:36.460 --> 38:38.098
NOW, FIREMEN ON
THE OTHER HAND--

38:38.100 --> 38:40.159
IS DATING LIKE AN EXCUSE
FOR YOU TO FIGURE OUT

38:40.160 --> 38:41.923
WHO YOU WANNA BE
WHEN YOU GROW UP ?

38:41.930 --> 38:43.329
I DON'T KNOW.

38:43.330 --> 38:45.890
IS DATING LIKE AN EXCUSE FOR YOU
TO SEE WHO YOU WISHED YOU'D BEEN

38:45.900 --> 38:47.197
WHEN YOU WERE
MY AGE ?

39:00.500 --> 39:03.253
( snoring )

39:26.360 --> 39:28.328
(techno music )

39:51.400 --> 39:52.753
LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE.

39:52.760 --> 39:54.193
WHY ?

40:28.260 --> 40:30.694
( moaning )

41:21.100 --> 41:23.728
DAVID, WAIT, DAVID.

41:26.160 --> 41:27.752
WHO WAS THAT ?

41:27.760 --> 41:29.227
JUST A GUY I KNOW.

41:29.230 --> 41:30.720
HE WANTS TO
GO HOME WITH US.

41:30.730 --> 41:32.288
I DON'T THINK SO.

41:32.300 --> 41:33.653
DAVID, COME ON,
YOU'LL LOVE HIM.

41:33.660 --> 41:35.389
I PROMISE, HE'S
A TOTAL FUCK MACHINE.

41:35.400 --> 41:36.458
I SAID NO.

41:36.460 --> 41:38.189
WHY NOT ?

41:38.200 --> 41:39.895
WHY ARE YOU TAKING
THIS SO SERIOUSLY ?

41:39.900 --> 41:41.652
BECAUSE I'M
A SERIOUS GUY.

41:41.660 --> 41:43.491
I BURY PEOPLE
FOR A LIVING.

41:43.500 --> 41:45.650
WELL, THAT SHIT'S
IN YOUR HEAD.

41:45.660 --> 41:48.299
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT,
THAT SHIT IS IN MY HEAD.

41:52.960 --> 41:54.598
LOOK, GO,
HAVE FUN.

41:54.600 --> 41:56.693
I'M JUST TOO...

41:57.460 --> 41:59.325
I'M SORRY
THAT I CAN'T--

42:02.060 --> 42:04.051
I'M SORRY, BYE.

42:16.630 --> 42:18.427
YOU REALLY
SPOOKED ME, BREN'.

42:21.230 --> 42:22.527
WHAT ?

42:22.530 --> 42:24.851
THE IDEA OF
ME DYING ?

42:24.860 --> 42:27.749
WELL, YEAH.

42:28.930 --> 42:30.921
I WILL DIE
SOMEDAY.

42:38.330 --> 42:40.457
WE DIE, NATE.

42:40.460 --> 42:43.657
WE ALL DIE.

43:15.660 --> 43:17.355
HELLO.

43:18.300 --> 43:20.427
( clock ticking )

44:04.760 --> 44:07.490
YOU CERTAINLY TOOK YOUR
SWEET TIME GETTING HERE.

44:07.500 --> 44:09.650
YOU'LL RUIN
THAT SHIRT.

44:09.660 --> 44:12.322
AH, WHO CARES.

44:19.860 --> 44:22.021
WHAT, YOU'RE
HITTING ON ME NOW ?

44:22.030 --> 44:24.658
TWO GUYS AREN'T ENOUGH
FOR YOU, YOU SLUT ?

44:24.660 --> 44:26.252
OH, DEAR.

44:26.260 --> 44:28.353
I SUPPOSE I OWE
YOU AN APOLOGY.

44:28.360 --> 44:30.089
WHY ?
I'M DEAD.

44:30.100 --> 44:31.988
YES, BUT I WAS SEEING
HIRAM BEFORE YOU--

44:32.000 --> 44:35.390
I WAS GONE LONG
BEFORE I DIED.

44:35.400 --> 44:38.756
YOU'D LIKE HIRAM,
HE'S KIND,
HE MAKES ME LAUGH.

44:38.760 --> 44:40.625
OH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

44:40.630 --> 44:42.325
I GOT MY MONEY
ON THE FLORIST.

44:42.330 --> 44:45.219
OH, HEAVENS NO, NATHANIEL,
THE MAN IS A COMPLETE SAVAGE.

44:45.230 --> 44:46.788
OOH, DING,
DING, DING.

44:49.200 --> 44:50.622
OH, GOD.

44:50.630 --> 44:53.190
THIS IS THE HEARSE THAT WAS
ALWAYS STALLING, ISN'T IT ?

44:53.200 --> 44:57.318
REMEMBER AFTER
THAT FUNERAL IN MALIBU
FOR THAT JAZZ MUSICIAN ?

44:57.330 --> 44:59.298
WE BROKE DOWN
ON THE SIDE OF PCH

44:59.300 --> 45:01.689
AND WE MADE LOVE
IN THE BACK.

45:01.700 --> 45:03.793
IF THIS BABY
COULD TALK, HUH ?

45:03.800 --> 45:07.918
NATHANIEL, WHAT
HAPPENED TO US ?

45:09.100 --> 45:11.295
WE WERE SO
IN LOVE ONCE.

45:11.300 --> 45:13.552
LIFE HAPPENED TO US.

45:13.560 --> 45:15.528
I BURIED HUNDREDS
OF PEOPLE

45:19.300 --> 45:20.892
BUT, WE'RE NOT OLD.

45:20.900 --> 45:23.357
WELL, TECHNICALLY SPEAKING, I'M
AS OLD AS I'M EVER GONNA GET.

45:23.360 --> 45:27.319
WE WERE SUCH CHILDREN
WHEN WE MET,

45:27.330 --> 45:30.652
THEN WE WATCHED
THOSE CHILDREN DISAPPEAR.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.094
DAMNIT,
STALLED AGAIN.

45:40.100 --> 45:42.227
IT WON'T GO FORWARD.
IT WON'T GO BACK.

45:42.230 --> 45:44.528
WELL, THESE
CAN'T BE HELPING.

46:05.500 --> 46:07.695
NO TEARS.

46:08.430 --> 46:10.159
I MISS WHAT WE HAD.

46:10.160 --> 46:13.220
SO, FIND IT AGAIN.

46:48.560 --> 46:50.824
( humming )

47:04.260 --> 47:06.558
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

47:06.560 --> 47:08.721
YOU SHOULD
HAVE WOKEN ME UP.

47:08.730 --> 47:11.597
I THOUGHT YOU COULD
USE THE SLEEP
AFTER THE NIGHT WE HAD.

47:11.600 --> 47:14.956
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN THAT
PASSIONATE WITH ME BEFORE.

47:16.260 --> 47:18.490
THANK YOU FOR
A WONDERFUL NIGHT.

47:18.500 --> 47:20.695
LAST NIGHT ?

47:20.700 --> 47:23.260
YOU WERE SPECTACULAR.

47:23.260 --> 47:24.989
( laughing )

47:26.730 --> 47:28.322
WHAT ?

47:42.300 --> 47:43.699
DO I JUST
SIT ANYWHERE ?

47:43.700 --> 47:45.292
WHEREVER YOU'D LIKE.

47:50.700 --> 47:52.725
( clearing throat)

47:54.000 --> 47:55.888
NICE SUIT.

47:55.900 --> 47:58.391
THANK YOU, I BOUGHT
IT LAST WEEK.

47:58.400 --> 48:00.129
I FIGURED YOU NEED
MORE THAN ONE SUIT

48:00.130 --> 48:01.688
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE
A FUNERAL DIRECTOR.

48:01.700 --> 48:03.122
YOU NEED TO
PASS A TEST FIRST.

48:03.130 --> 48:06.497
YOU JUST CAN'T LET
GO OF THAT, CAN YOU ?

48:07.600 --> 48:09.693
I FAILED THE FIRST TIME
I TOOK IT.

48:09.700 --> 48:10.894
YOU DID NOT.

48:10.900 --> 48:12.128
OH, YES, I DID.

48:12.130 --> 48:14.849
I FUCK UP A LOT MORE
THAN YOU MIGHT THINK.

48:14.860 --> 48:17.090
I FUCK UP A LOT.

48:36.600 --> 48:37.555
HEY.

48:37.560 --> 48:39.096
HI.

48:40.730 --> 48:42.595
HOW ARE YOU
HOLDING UP ?

48:42.600 --> 48:45.649
OKAY, I GUESS.

48:45.660 --> 48:47.855
IT'S JUST WEIRD.

48:51.760 --> 48:54.422
WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO NICE TO ME ?

48:55.530 --> 48:57.395
YOU LITTLE BASTARD !

48:57.400 --> 48:59.356
SAM, WE DIDN'T
THINK YOU'D SHOW.

49:04.200 --> 49:05.724
STOP IT !

49:05.730 --> 49:08.255
I OUGHT TO KILL YOU,
YOU USELESS FUCK.

49:08.260 --> 49:10.353
OKAY, EVERYBODY
CALM DOWN.

49:10.360 --> 49:13.056
PROBABLY WASTED OUT OF
YOUR MIND, WHACKING OFF !

49:13.060 --> 49:14.755
LET MY KID
SHOOT HIMSELF.

49:14.760 --> 49:16.990
YOU'RE GONNA
BLAME HIM ?

49:17.000 --> 49:19.127
WHERE THE FUCK WERE YOU
FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS ?!

49:27.560 --> 49:30.120
ALRIGHT, JUST
TAKE IT EASY.

49:31.400 --> 49:32.424
EVERYTHING
ALRIGHT ?

49:32.430 --> 49:33.692
YEAH.

49:33.700 --> 49:35.725
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
I'LL DEAL WITH IT.

49:35.730 --> 49:37.391
THANK YOU.

49:43.900 --> 49:46.027
WHO THE FUCK WAS THAT
LITTLE BITCH OUT THERE ?

49:46.030 --> 49:48.248
THAT'S MY SISTER.

49:48.260 --> 49:50.353
YOU SHOULD WARN HER.

49:50.360 --> 49:53.056
GABRIEL HAS BEEN A FUCK-UP
HIS WHOLE LIFE.

49:53.060 --> 49:54.698
WHEN I USED TO
LIVED THERE,

49:54.700 --> 49:56.224
HE USED TO DRIVE
HIS MOTHER NUTS

49:56.230 --> 49:57.788
WITH ALL THE SHIT
THAT HE'D DO.

49:57.800 --> 49:59.051
STAYING OUT
ALL NIGHT.

49:59.060 --> 50:02.291
NO FUCKING
RESPONSIBILITY.

50:03.630 --> 50:05.518
THAT'S MY KID
WHO'S DEAD.

50:05.530 --> 50:07.122
I KNOW.

50:10.830 --> 50:12.923
IT WAS MY GUN.

50:14.400 --> 50:16.925
I BOUGHT IT
FOR VICKIE.

50:18.860 --> 50:21.454
I WAS GONNA LEAVE FOR A WHILE,
YOU KNOW, GO UP NORTH FOR A JOB.

50:21.460 --> 50:23.724
MAKE SOME
EXTRA MONEY.

50:25.930 --> 50:28.296
HOW COULD HE LET SOMETHING
LIKE THIS HAPPEN ?

50:28.300 --> 50:29.324
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

50:29.330 --> 50:30.888
IT'S JUST NOT
FUCKING RIGHT !

50:30.900 --> 50:33.892
JESUS, HE WAS SIX !

50:35.830 --> 50:38.993
EVERYBODY DIES.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.729
SOME OF US LIVE
TO BE 100,

50:40.730 --> 50:42.595
SOME OF US NEVER MAKE IT
THROUGH OUR FIRST DAY.

50:42.600 --> 50:44.352
THAT'S JUST A FUCKING
FACT OF NATURE, PAL.

50:44.360 --> 50:46.191
WHO THE FUCK DO
YOU THINK YOU ARE ?

50:46.200 --> 50:47.952
YOU CAN PUNCH AS
MANY PEOPLE AS YOU WANT.

50:47.960 --> 50:49.894
IT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE
THE FACT THAT BOY IS DEAD.

50:49.900 --> 50:54.599
AND YOUR CHANCE TO BE
IN HIS LIFE IS OVER.

50:54.600 --> 50:56.397
DID YOU USE
THAT TIME WELL,

50:56.400 --> 50:59.722
OR DID YOU JUST
PISS IT AWAY ?

50:59.730 --> 51:02.927
AND YOUR OWN FUCKING LIFE
IS A TICKING CLOCK, TOO.

51:04.760 --> 51:06.625
EVERYBODY'S IS.

51:39.200 --> 51:41.156
MOM, YOU'RE HOME,
I WAS WORRIED.

51:41.160 --> 51:42.559
WORRIED, WHY ?

51:42.560 --> 51:43.754
AH...

51:43.760 --> 51:45.455
DID YOU HAVE
A GOOD TIME ?

51:45.460 --> 51:47.496
OH, DAVID,
YOU MUST GO CAMPING.

51:47.500 --> 51:50.025
IT'S SO SPECTACULAR
UP THERE RIGHT NOW.

51:50.030 --> 51:52.624
SPRING IS SUCH
A FULL TIME.

51:52.630 --> 51:55.349
SO MUCH COLOR,
SO MUCH DETAIL.

51:55.360 --> 51:56.918
AND THE SMELLS.

51:56.930 --> 51:59.228
IT'S LIKE
NOTHING ELSE.

51:59.230 --> 52:00.322
AND YOU'RE OKAY ?

52:00.330 --> 52:02.628
NO SICKNESS,
NO HEADACHES ?

52:02.630 --> 52:03.790
OH, NO.

52:03.800 --> 52:05.722
I HAD ONE
ON THE TRIP,

52:05.730 --> 52:07.925
BUT I TOOK SOME ASPIRIN
AND IT JUST DISAPPEARED.

52:07.930 --> 52:12.094
YES, WELL, ASPIRIN
IS DAMN GOOD STUFF.

52:12.100 --> 52:13.852
HOW WAS
THE SERVICE ?

52:13.860 --> 52:16.328
THERE WAS A FIGHT
THAT BROKE OUT,

52:16.330 --> 52:18.423
BUT I LET NATE
TAKE CARE OF IT.

52:18.430 --> 52:21.297
I'M GLAD YOU BOYS ARE WORKING
SO WELL TOGETHER NOW.

52:23.430 --> 52:24.829
CLAIRE, YOU LOOK
TERRIBLE.

52:24.830 --> 52:27.048
ARE YOU NOT
FEELING WELL ?

52:27.060 --> 52:29.858
I'M JUST
A LITTLE WRECKED.

52:29.860 --> 52:32.192
WE BURIED MY FRIEND'S
BROTHER TODAY.

52:32.200 --> 52:34.225
HE'S YOUR FRIEND ?

52:34.230 --> 52:35.629
I HAD NO IDEA.

52:35.630 --> 52:38.121
YEAH.

52:40.160 --> 52:42.754
HE'S THE FOOT GUY.

52:42.760 --> 52:45.399
OH, MY GOD.

52:49.860 --> 52:51.794
GOODNIGHT.

52:57.830 --> 52:59.252
THERE'S SO MUCH
YOU WISH YOU COULD

52:59.260 --> 53:01.228
PROTECT YOUR
CHILDREN FROM.

53:08.660 --> 53:10.696
'NIGHT, MOM.

53:10.700 --> 53:13.123
