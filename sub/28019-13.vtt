21:47.523 --> 21:49.786
I don't know a Tyler Walker.

21:49.830 --> 21:52.572
We only had one C.I.
in Kendrick's operation,

21:52.615 --> 21:53.964
and she showed up
floating in the Saint Lawrence

21:54.008 --> 21:55.096
six months ago.

21:55.139 --> 21:56.619
[phone chimes]

21:59.143 --> 22:00.406
I'll be back.

22:00.449 --> 22:03.278
For now, maybe think
about getting an attorney.

22:03.322 --> 22:06.020
I recommend you get a good one.

22:09.415 --> 22:10.938
No, yeah, I got it
right in front of me.

22:10.981 --> 22:12.722
Yeah, I've got
the spreadsheet open.

22:12.766 --> 22:15.421
It's, um, it's all reconciled.

22:15.464 --> 22:18.424
They've been paid. Uh-huh.

22:18.467 --> 22:21.601
Okay. Yeah.
I'll talk to you soon.

22:21.644 --> 22:23.864
Okay, bye.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.998
[screaming]

22:33.526 --> 22:35.832
H-He just told
whoever he was talking to

22:35.876 --> 22:37.791
that he was looking
at the laptop.

22:37.834 --> 22:39.706
That must be
one of the Caretakers.

22:39.749 --> 22:41.229
Who are they?

22:41.272 --> 22:44.232
They run drugs and contraband
into the prisons.

22:44.275 --> 22:46.452
Half of them are ex-cons,
the other half work there.

22:46.495 --> 22:48.497
Well, he's lying to them.

22:48.541 --> 22:51.021
They think he has the laptop,
but he doesn't.

22:51.065 --> 22:52.371
Yeah, 'cause he's scared
of what'll happen

22:52.414 --> 22:53.502
when they find out.

22:53.546 --> 22:55.243
Eric could use that as leverage.

22:55.286 --> 22:56.723
We need to get
in touch with him.

22:56.766 --> 22:58.289
You said there was
a phone in the car?

22:58.333 --> 23:01.118
Yeah, but they'll hear us
if we break in.

23:01.162 --> 23:02.903
[sighs]

23:02.946 --> 23:06.036
Tyler, we, we need to
think of something.

23:10.345 --> 23:12.608
ZARA:
Okay, thanks.
Talk to you later.

23:12.652 --> 23:14.610
You find out anything?

23:14.654 --> 23:16.133
The Montreal Police Service,

23:16.177 --> 23:18.135
they're drawing up charges
against Eric.

23:18.179 --> 23:20.616
They're talking conspiracy,
suggesting he was working

23:20.660 --> 23:22.444
with Dr. Kendrick.

23:22.488 --> 23:25.360
Okay, I'm all about
the power of positive thinking,

23:25.404 --> 23:27.406
but Eric is on the verge
of going to prison,

23:27.449 --> 23:30.409
and getting that laptop back now
is impossible.

23:31.497 --> 23:33.455
What?

23:33.499 --> 23:35.196
We can't do anything
about the laptop,

23:35.239 --> 23:38.242
but there might be
a way to help Eric.

23:50.516 --> 23:52.343
Hey.

23:52.387 --> 23:55.259
How's this?

23:56.739 --> 23:58.219
Perfect, sis.

23:58.262 --> 23:59.699
[chuckles]

23:59.742 --> 24:01.352
You were always so
good at tinkering.

24:01.396 --> 24:02.484
I remember

24:02.528 --> 24:05.095
you taking apart the microwave

24:05.139 --> 24:06.575
just to see
how it worked.

24:06.619 --> 24:10.492
Yeah. I was sweating,
putting that back together.

24:10.536 --> 24:13.495
Thinking about him walking in
and seeing it in pieces.

24:13.539 --> 24:19.022
You never told me the whole
story, about the night he died.

24:19.066 --> 24:21.547
'Cause I'm mixed up with this,
you think I murdered him?

24:21.590 --> 24:22.896
No.

24:22.939 --> 24:24.419
Of course not.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.421
You never should have
gone to prison.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.903
We just never really
talked about it.

24:29.946 --> 24:31.774
I'd called you that night.

24:32.993 --> 24:35.256
He'd been raging more
since you'd run away.

24:35.299 --> 24:39.303
Wasn't making as much money
from the foster agency, I guess.

24:42.785 --> 24:45.440
[line ringing]

24:45.484 --> 24:47.224
You were out, you didn't answer.

24:48.791 --> 24:50.489
He said I broke the TV remote.

24:52.099 --> 24:54.405
He was hurting me.

24:54.449 --> 24:56.277
Usually, I just sucked it up,

24:56.320 --> 24:58.105
but that night...

24:58.148 --> 24:59.498
[shouts]

24:59.541 --> 25:01.630
...that night,
I pushed him back.

25:01.674 --> 25:03.676
[thudding]

25:11.292 --> 25:13.424
He broke his neck in the fall.

25:14.425 --> 25:15.775
What did you do?

25:15.818 --> 25:17.428
I ran.

25:17.472 --> 25:19.343
[siren wailing][panting]

25:19.387 --> 25:21.955
Made it
to Michael Forman's house.

25:21.998 --> 25:23.870
Hid there until the cops came.

25:28.962 --> 25:31.617
CYNTHIA:
You never stood
a chance, Tyler.

25:31.660 --> 25:33.053
To them, you
were just

25:33.096 --> 25:37.840
some delinquent kid
who killed his foster father.

25:38.885 --> 25:41.322
I'm so sorry, what
happened to you.

25:41.365 --> 25:43.106
Nothing you could do about it.

25:43.150 --> 25:45.674
Just got
to let it go, sis.

25:45.718 --> 25:50.157
Funny thing is,
I did break the remote,

25:50.200 --> 25:52.072
just to piss him off.

25:52.115 --> 25:53.552
[both laughing]

25:56.685 --> 25:59.340
Okay. Let's do this.

25:59.383 --> 26:01.168
[Demarais clears throat]

26:01.211 --> 26:02.561
You're free to go.

26:03.692 --> 26:06.782
Don't look at me.
Wasn't my call.

26:06.826 --> 26:08.001
Somebody's arranged

26:08.044 --> 26:10.046
a "get out of jail free" card
for you.

26:16.836 --> 26:19.012
He's all yours,
Agent Barrett.

26:38.901 --> 26:40.468
ERIC:
What did you do?

26:40.511 --> 26:42.470
KATE:
I made some calls,

26:42.513 --> 26:43.819
pulled in some favors.
What do you think?

26:43.863 --> 26:46.082
Okay, I didn't
ask you to do this.

26:46.126 --> 26:47.606
Am I supposed to just
get used to seeing you

26:47.649 --> 26:48.868
in an orange jumpsuit?

26:48.911 --> 26:50.217
It's not a good look on you.

26:50.260 --> 26:51.566
Kate, I didn't ask you
because I didn't want

26:51.610 --> 26:52.698
to compromise you again.

26:52.741 --> 26:55.788
I know how much
your work means to you.

26:55.831 --> 26:58.312
And this case you're on,
it involves stealing evidence

26:58.355 --> 26:59.661
to help a major crime syndicate,

26:59.705 --> 27:01.924
is that correct?

27:01.968 --> 27:03.491
There is a good reason.

27:03.534 --> 27:05.493
There always is.

27:05.536 --> 27:06.668
So tell me.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.365
I'm not involving you anymore.

27:08.409 --> 27:12.326
Okay. Have it your way.

27:12.369 --> 27:14.807
This is the third time.

27:14.850 --> 27:17.548
I got to go.Okay, Kate? Please.

27:17.592 --> 27:20.029
Don't you have a world to save?

27:23.729 --> 27:26.209
[sighs]
Hey.

27:26.253 --> 27:29.691
Hey.

27:29.735 --> 27:31.345
Hi, Eric.

27:31.388 --> 27:32.868
I'm sorry, but Kate was
the only one I could think of...

27:32.912 --> 27:35.001
It's okay, it's okay,
you did what you had to do.

27:35.044 --> 27:36.742
The lieutenant
I spoke to,

27:36.785 --> 27:38.744
he said Tyler isn't a C.I.

27:38.787 --> 27:41.877
So if he wasn't a snitch,
why did Kendrick want him dead?

27:41.921 --> 27:43.574
Maybe he just wanted Cynthia,
use her as leverage

27:43.618 --> 27:45.054
to force us
to get the laptop back.

27:45.098 --> 27:46.969
ERIC:
Yeah, but Cynthia said,
"I was with Tyler

27:47.013 --> 27:48.405
whenhe was abducted."

27:50.799 --> 27:52.671
Kendrick didn't even plan
on getting Cynthia.

27:52.714 --> 27:54.803
He was after Tyler,
to kill him.

27:54.847 --> 27:56.196
OLIVER:
Okay, what if

27:56.239 --> 27:57.980
Tyler knows
how to open the laptop

27:58.024 --> 27:59.199
and access the data on it?

27:59.242 --> 28:01.854
ERIC:
Maybe if he has the password?

28:01.897 --> 28:03.638
[exhales]
Yes.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.466
ZARA:
That makes sense.
If he couldn't get it back

28:05.509 --> 28:07.816
from the police, then Dr.
Kendrick wouldwant Tyler dead.

28:07.860 --> 28:09.122
[horn honks, car beeps]

28:14.301 --> 28:15.694
[phone ringing]

28:15.737 --> 28:17.696
Crisis Resolution.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.654
CYNTHIA: Eric.Cynthia.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.482
Are you okay?

28:21.525 --> 28:22.526
Listen to me.
I overheard Dr. Kendrick

28:22.570 --> 28:23.571
on the phone.

28:23.614 --> 28:24.703
He lied to the Caretakers

28:24.746 --> 28:26.269
about the laptop,

28:26.313 --> 28:28.794
and he's terrified of them
finding out he doesn't have it.

28:28.837 --> 28:30.230
Do you have it?No. Not yet.

28:30.273 --> 28:31.274
[exhales]

28:31.318 --> 28:32.623
ZARA:
Can you locate the source?

28:32.667 --> 28:33.886
The burner phone's
defaulted to Wi-Fi calling.

28:33.929 --> 28:35.148
I can't trace it.

28:35.191 --> 28:36.540
Look, we're gonna get you out,
but, Tyler,

28:36.584 --> 28:37.672
are you able to decrypt
the laptop?

28:37.716 --> 28:39.456
Do you know the password?

28:39.500 --> 28:41.763
I can access it
by retinal scan.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.765
Okay, so you can open it.
C-Can anyone else?

28:43.809 --> 28:46.202
Kendrick, he can. Though
the last few times,

28:46.246 --> 28:47.421
he had trouble with his scan.

28:47.464 --> 28:48.727
He got frustrated.

28:48.770 --> 28:50.119
That's why he set me up
to do it.

28:50.163 --> 28:51.599
ZARA:
Dr. Kendrick's

28:51.642 --> 28:53.906
medical files as part
of their surveillance report.

28:53.949 --> 28:56.604
I noticed that he had surgery
a couple of weeks ago.

28:56.647 --> 28:58.432
Here it is.

28:58.475 --> 28:59.825
Cataracts.

28:59.868 --> 29:02.044
It can take more than
a month for the eyes to heal.

29:02.088 --> 29:03.480
Only then can you reset
your eye scan.

29:03.524 --> 29:05.744
So he can't open it.
Only Tyler can.

29:05.787 --> 29:07.789
Hey!
[shouts]

29:07.833 --> 29:08.790
CYNTHIA:
Leave him alone!

29:08.834 --> 29:09.922
Cynthia?
Hello?

29:09.965 --> 29:11.967
Hey! Leave my...

29:12.011 --> 29:14.796
Hey, get off of me.
Get off of me.

29:14.840 --> 29:15.971
Get... Tyler.

29:17.668 --> 29:19.105
ERIC:
Cynthia?

29:19.148 --> 29:20.628
Eric Beaumont, I'm guessing.

29:20.671 --> 29:23.326
You have my laptop?Don't you dare hurt them.

29:23.370 --> 29:26.808
Or what? You have eight hours.

29:26.852 --> 29:28.984
Okay, we have
to do something now.

29:29.028 --> 29:30.986
We've got leverage.

29:31.030 --> 29:32.814
Time to use it.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.642
KENDRICK:
Tyler.

29:34.685 --> 29:36.818
Haven't I always been
good to you?

29:36.862 --> 29:38.472
You call this being good?

29:38.515 --> 29:40.648
Why did you lie to me
about the laptop?

29:40.691 --> 29:43.172
You would have killed me.

29:46.915 --> 29:49.178
No, you're wrong.

29:50.571 --> 29:53.400
I protected you.

29:53.443 --> 29:55.663
Because that's what family does.

29:55.706 --> 29:58.187
Don't listen to him, Tyler.

30:02.888 --> 30:04.498
Bring them.

30:04.541 --> 30:06.935
[whimpers softly]

30:06.979 --> 30:08.937
TYLER: No...Come on. Get.

30:08.981 --> 30:10.156
Let's go.

30:13.333 --> 30:14.638
You got to be kidding me.

30:14.682 --> 30:15.814
ERIC:
Uh, this is
my associate

30:15.857 --> 30:17.903
Oliver Yates.
We have a proposal.

30:17.946 --> 30:19.948
I noticed you hadn't filled
out a missing persons report

30:19.992 --> 30:21.994
on your friends.
Was that all a scam?

30:22.037 --> 30:23.952
We didn't fill it out
because there's no time
for an investigation.

30:23.996 --> 30:25.867
OLIVER:
You're trying
to break the encryption

30:25.911 --> 30:27.869
on Kendrick's laptop to
bring down the Caretakers.

30:27.913 --> 30:31.873
The odds of you cracking it are,
to put it generously, remote.

30:31.917 --> 30:34.571
So?So Tyler Walker's
the only person

30:34.615 --> 30:36.051
that can open it.

30:36.095 --> 30:37.400
We can mirror the
contents of the laptop

30:37.444 --> 30:39.402
once he does that.And your point is?

30:39.446 --> 30:40.882
ERIC:
What we're saying is,
giving it back

30:40.926 --> 30:43.015
to Dr. Kendrick
not only frees our friends,

30:43.058 --> 30:44.494
it's your best chance
of getting the data

30:44.538 --> 30:47.410
that you
and the FBI want.

30:49.151 --> 30:52.589
Okay, give me about two hours to
rig and test the hacking chip.

30:53.895 --> 30:54.983
ZARA:
Oh, good.
You've got the laptop.

30:55.027 --> 30:56.593
What? What is it?

30:56.637 --> 30:58.465
Dr. Kendrick just called.
He sent a location.

30:58.508 --> 31:00.119
We're to meet him there
in 30 minutes,

31:00.162 --> 31:01.903
or he's gonna kill them both.

31:01.947 --> 31:03.557
Why would Kendrick
change the timeline?

31:03.600 --> 31:05.211
He said eight hours.

31:05.254 --> 31:06.995
The Caretakers
must be pressuring him.

31:07.039 --> 31:09.650
Uh, that-that's impossible.
I need 90 minutes minimum.

31:09.693 --> 31:12.174
He can't kill Tyler.
He'd never get the laptop open.

31:12.218 --> 31:13.915
That may be true,
but there's nothing stopping him

31:13.959 --> 31:15.351
from killing Cynthia.

31:15.395 --> 31:16.831
You said Dr. Kendrick
doesn't run the Caretakers,

31:16.875 --> 31:18.311
he works for them.Yes.

31:18.354 --> 31:19.660
If they found out
the police had the laptop

31:19.703 --> 31:20.835
and Kendrick lied about it,

31:20.879 --> 31:22.881
they'd come after
him to make him pay.

31:22.924 --> 31:25.057
Let's go. Bring the laptop.But, Eric,

31:25.100 --> 31:26.841
I just told you I need
more than hour to rig

31:26.885 --> 31:29.278
the hacking chip...Just bring it.

31:46.208 --> 31:49.951
KENDRICK:
Eight minutes
to high noon.

31:49.995 --> 31:52.519
Let's hope your faith
in Mr. Beaumont's skill

31:52.562 --> 31:53.694
isn't misplaced.

31:53.737 --> 31:55.957
Let her go.
