00:07.697 --> 00:08.968
the week come in?

00:09.093 --> 00:10.741
Better. It's the day

00:10.742 --> 00:12.388
I've waited for

00:09.093 --> 00:12.388
since summer began.

00:12.513 --> 00:13.598
The end of summer!

00:15.808 --> 00:17.309
- Try to contain
- yourself, Bertram.

00:17.435 --> 00:18.666
You're drooling

00:18.667 --> 00:19.896
in our eggs.

00:20.020 --> 00:23.128
My plan for this year is

00:23.129 --> 00:26.235
to reduce my wedgie ratio

00:20.020 --> 00:26.235
to one per fortnight.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.296
- Yeah, if you - keep using words
- Like "fortnight,"

00:28.320 --> 00:30.406
It's going to be a long,

00:30.407 --> 00:32.491
wedgie-rific year.

00:32.616 --> 00:34.265
I just hope I don't

have to sit next to

Gross Gus again.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.037
He's always shoving

00:37.038 --> 00:38.038
stuff up his nose!

00:39.999 --> 00:41.376
He claims he doesn't know

00:41.377 --> 00:42.752
what happened to my crayon,

00:42.877 --> 00:44.338
but how does he explain

00:44.339 --> 00:45.797
that magenta snot?

00:47.506 --> 00:49.341
- Oh, my!
- Look at the time.

00:49.467 --> 00:51.528

- on your first day back!

We're gonna be late.

- Okay, and then...

more of a chance.

Unlike Rosie,

07:47.928 --> 07:50.179
those overalls were

07:50.304 --> 07:51.431
All right, listen, Emma,

- something you have
- in common with her.

08:14.619 --> 08:17.873
about Justin Bieber.

08:20.418 --> 08:22.920
So, I've always wondered,

08:23.045 --> 08:24.713
- how does it feel
- to spend every

08:24.838 --> 08:26.631
- Day slaving away
- for the upper class?

08:26.757 --> 08:29.593
Oh! It's horrible.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.303
- Can you pass me
- the caviar?

08:31.429 --> 08:32.870
- I think I'll eat it
- in the sauna.

08:37.601 --> 08:39.352
- Hey, Rosie.
- Before we start,

08:39.477 --> 08:40.772
Why don't we sit

08:40.773 --> 08:42.063
at the table and have

08:39.477 --> 08:42.063
a little chit-chat?

08:49.154 --> 08:50.552
So, what do you

08:50.553 --> 08:51.949
like to do for fun?

08:52.074 --> 08:54.452
Stick it to the man.

08:54.618 --> 08:56.954
Okay.

08:57.079 --> 08:59.394
But do you ever, like,

08:59.395 --> 09:01.708
play volleyball,

08:57.079 --> 09:01.708
or go to the movies?

09:01.833 --> 09:03.982
Or, you know, not make

09:03.983 --> 09:06.130
people uncomfortable?

09:06.255 --> 09:08.445
No. But I am setting up

09:08.446 --> 09:10.634
a rally in Times Square

09:06.255 --> 09:10.634
to protest deforestation.

09:10.759 --> 09:12.991
Speaking of deforestation,

09:12.992 --> 09:15.222
have you ever thought of

09:10.759 --> 09:15.222
plucking your eyebrows?

09:16.640 --> 09:17.954
No, I'm very happy

09:17.955 --> 09:19.268
with the one I have.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.167
But my mom says

09:22.168 --> 09:23.439
everyone loves a makeover.

09:23.647 --> 09:25.753
That's how she sold

09:25.754 --> 09:27.859
enough beauty products to

09:23.647 --> 09:27.859
pay for the new helipad.

09:27.985 --> 09:30.175
Listen, princess,

09:30.176 --> 09:32.364
you and I will never have

09:27.985 --> 09:32.364
anything in common.

09:32.490 --> 09:34.384
- Let's talk tomorrow.
- To get back to the Bronx,

09:34.408 --> 09:36.009
- I have to take
- three trains and a bus

09:36.118 --> 09:37.141
To where my aunt

09:37.142 --> 09:38.162
picks me up

09:36.118 --> 09:38.162
on her garbage truck.

09:39.955 --> 09:41.415
Wait!

09:41.540 --> 09:42.916
The Bronx is a real place?

09:44.668 --> 09:46.337
- I thought
- it was imaginary,

09:46.462 --> 09:48.297
- Like Narnia or
- Staten Island.

09:49.965 --> 09:51.675
- Zuri, you have to
- do your homework,

09:51.716 --> 09:53.069
- Or you won't get
- anywhere in life!

09:53.093 --> 09:54.261
Yeah, look where

09:54.262 --> 09:55.429
doing homework

09:53.093 --> 09:55.429
got you!

09:56.930 --> 09:58.765
- Losing at tug-of-war
- to an eight-year old!

09:58.890 --> 10:00.892
I'm not losing. Aah!

10:01.018 --> 10:02.018
(LAUGHS)

10:07.525 --> 10:10.235
Jessie, your advice stinks!

10:10.361 --> 10:12.070
I hate high school!

10:12.196 --> 10:14.240
I wish I could just

10:14.241 --> 10:16.283
stay home and take it

10:12.196 --> 10:16.283
easy all day like you.

10:16.408 --> 10:17.723
Yeah, try taking it easy

10:17.724 --> 10:19.036
with a remote

10:16.408 --> 10:19.036
lodged in your colon!

10:25.417 --> 10:27.002
You can come out now, Ravi.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.317
Today everyone

10:28.318 --> 10:29.505
will have moved on to

10:27.127 --> 10:29.505
teasing someone else.

10:32.466 --> 10:33.843
Eh, it is actually

10:33.844 --> 10:35.219
quite homey in here.

10:35.344 --> 10:36.367
I even dug myself

10:36.368 --> 10:37.388
a panic room.

10:38.514 --> 10:40.391
Which I will now utilize!

10:44.769 --> 10:47.398
Well, hey, Wittle Wavi.

10:47.523 --> 10:49.233
- Where's your
- teddy bear today?

10:49.358 --> 10:50.901
Did you drop him off

10:50.902 --> 10:52.444
at day care

10:49.358 --> 10:52.444
on the way to school?

10:52.570 --> 10:55.614
If I did, it would have been

10:55.615 --> 10:58.658
the responsible thing to do

10:52.570 --> 10:58.658
as a working parent.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.015
You're making this

11:00.016 --> 11:01.245
way too easy.

11:01.370 --> 11:02.370
(WHISTLES)

11:08.627 --> 11:10.421
Oh!

11:10.546 --> 11:11.755
Oh, Ravi!

11:11.756 --> 11:12.964
Are you okay?

11:13.090 --> 11:14.758
The joke is on them.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.510
Oh, they missed a spot.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.308
- Oh, shame on you,
- Mary-Beth!

11:23.434 --> 11:25.144
Hall monitors are supposed

11:25.145 --> 11:26.853
to protect and serve!

11:29.940 --> 11:31.376
- You know, Rosie,
- I always suspected

11:31.400 --> 11:32.485
You got your clothes

11:32.486 --> 11:33.569
from the trash.

11:33.777 --> 11:36.280
And here's the proof.

11:36.405 --> 11:38.240
- At least I can
- remember my name

11:38.365 --> 11:39.533
Without reading my shirt.

11:41.452 --> 11:42.661
And for your information,

11:42.662 --> 11:43.870
I'm wearing these soda rings

11:43.995 --> 11:45.018
to protest the damage

11:45.019 --> 11:46.039
they can do

11:43.995 --> 11:46.039
to the environment.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.666
They can suffocate birds.

11:47.791 --> 11:48.792
And in your case,

11:48.793 --> 11:49.793
repel boys.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.796
(BELL RINGING)

11:54.548 --> 11:56.300
Oh, you all showed up.

11:58.802 --> 12:01.305
Uh, well, in that case,

12:01.430 --> 12:02.703
uh, you should keep

12:02.704 --> 12:03.974
working on your projects.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.602
Maybe someday

12:07.603 --> 12:09.354
you'll be as successful

12:05.850 --> 12:09.354
as Bobo the chimp.

12:10.689 --> 12:12.191
His finger paintings

12:12.192 --> 12:13.692
edged out my landscapes

12:13.817 --> 12:15.256
for a spot at

12:15.257 --> 12:16.695
The Guggenheim.

12:16.820 --> 12:18.572
I really hate that monkey!

12:20.115 --> 12:21.158
I think Ms. Devlin

12:21.159 --> 12:22.200
could use some bran.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.058
So, would you mind

12:25.059 --> 12:26.246
if I maybe

12:26.371 --> 12:28.165
- recorded our
- brainstorming sessions?

12:28.290 --> 12:29.771
I would never want

12:29.772 --> 12:31.251
to miss any of your

12:28.290 --> 12:31.251
super-smart ideas.

12:31.376 --> 12:32.586
Sure!

12:32.711 --> 12:34.592
- And I had an - awesome idea
- For the project.

12:34.713 --> 12:36.089
- But in order to
- make it work,

12:36.214 --> 12:37.279
You would

12:37.280 --> 12:38.342
have to dress up

12:36.214 --> 12:38.342
like a beautiful doll.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.386
(GASPS) I can do that!

12:40.387 --> 12:42.304
I love fashion!

12:42.429 --> 12:43.952
Um, but is it all right

12:43.953 --> 12:45.474
if I pick out my own outfit?

12:45.599 --> 12:46.599
Not that I don't love...

12:46.850 --> 12:48.519
That.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.438
Whatever you think is best.

12:51.563 --> 12:52.981
You're the fashion guru.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.296
And since

12:54.297 --> 12:55.484
you'll be the presenter,

12:55.609 --> 12:56.610
I will take care

12:56.611 --> 12:57.611
of everything else.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.946
Really? That's so nice!

13:00.071 --> 13:01.406
Everyone should really

13:01.407 --> 13:02.741
stop calling you

13:00.071 --> 13:02.741
a heinous she-devil.

13:04.743 --> 13:06.078
Aw, do you need

13:06.079 --> 13:07.412
some bran, too?

13:11.416 --> 13:12.501
Bertram, can I have

13:12.502 --> 13:13.585
the peanut butter?

13:13.711 --> 13:15.130
Okay, but don't let it

13:15.131 --> 13:16.547
spoil your dinner.

13:16.672 --> 13:18.341
(SNIFFS) Smells like

13:18.342 --> 13:20.008
your liver souffle

13:16.672 --> 13:20.008
did that already.

13:21.677 --> 13:22.700
I always enjoy

13:22.701 --> 13:23.721
our little chats.

13:29.184 --> 13:30.894
- Eat your math sandwich,
- Mrs. Kipling.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.312
And if you

13:32.313 --> 13:33.647
clean your plate,

13:33.772 --> 13:35.066
you can have some

13:35.067 --> 13:36.358
vocab sheets for dessert.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.444
I'm sure they'll be

13:38.445 --> 13:40.404
"traumatic and loquacious."

13:40.529 --> 13:41.613
Yum!

13:45.116 --> 13:46.368
What's Mrs. Kipling eating?

13:47.118 --> 13:48.495
Oh, no!

13:48.620 --> 13:50.310
The lizard

13:50.311 --> 13:51.998
ate my homework!

13:52.123 --> 13:53.917
- That'll be one
- the teacher hasn't heard.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.440
Luckily, she emailed me

13:55.441 --> 13:56.920
your worksheets.

13:56.961 --> 13:57.961
But nice try.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.549
Stupid internet.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.593
I wish I was born

14:02.594 --> 14:04.511
in the olden times

14:00.674 --> 14:04.511
like you and Bertram.

14:04.636 --> 14:05.846
What do I have to do

14:05.847 --> 14:07.055
to get you to do

14:04.636 --> 14:07.055
your homework?

14:07.180 --> 14:08.223
It's really not that much.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.058
Wrong!

14:10.183 --> 14:12.061
The teacher assigned us

14:12.062 --> 14:13.937
more today, so now

14:10.183 --> 14:13.937
it's twice as much work.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.939
- Well, at least we know
- you can do math.

14:17.399 --> 14:19.192
- Ravi,
- what happened to you?

14:19.317 --> 14:20.944
A spitball ambush.

14:22.780 --> 14:25.241
Well, looks like

14:25.242 --> 14:27.701
this needs your

14:22.780 --> 14:27.701
undivided attention.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.347
- (WHISPERS)
- Thank you for being you.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.583
Ravi, who did this?

14:34.708 --> 14:36.355
The important thing is,

14:36.356 --> 14:38.002
it is not the fault of Luke.

14:38.128 --> 14:40.422
Luke, what did you do?

14:40.547 --> 14:42.048
It wasn't me!

14:42.173 --> 14:44.026
- Some kids at school - have
been giving Ravi - A hard time

14:44.050 --> 14:45.573
Because I may have

14:45.574 --> 14:47.095
sorta, kinda been seen

14:44.050 --> 14:47.095
at school with Kenny,

14:47.220 --> 14:48.514
and then sorta,

14:48.515 --> 14:49.807
kinda let Ravi

14:47.220 --> 14:49.807
take the heat for it.

14:49.973 --> 14:51.850
Luke, that is sorta,

14:51.851 --> 14:53.727
kinda despicable!

14:53.852 --> 14:54.853
Well, it's your fault!

14:54.978 --> 14:56.498
- How is that even
- remotely possible?

14:56.605 --> 14:57.628
You're the one

14:57.629 --> 14:58.649
who put Kenny

14:56.605 --> 14:58.649
in my backpack!

14:58.774 --> 15:00.276
Okay, so,

15:00.277 --> 15:01.777
that's not so remote.

15:01.985 --> 15:03.278
But how could you just

15:03.279 --> 15:04.571
stand by and let Ravi

15:01.985 --> 15:04.571
get wallpapered?

15:04.696 --> 15:06.281
- I didn't
- ask him to do this.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.158
- He volunteered.
- He's fine with it.

15:08.283 --> 15:09.993
- If I may interject...
- Ravi, not now!

15:10.118 --> 15:12.036
Clearly, he's not fine.

15:12.162 --> 15:13.997
- He's covered in
- saliva and shame!

15:16.625 --> 15:18.315
Is anyone else concerned

15:18.316 --> 15:20.003
that if I do not

15:16.625 --> 15:20.003
take a shower soon,

15:20.044 --> 15:21.880
I may harden into

15:21.881 --> 15:23.715
a giant papier-mache

15:20.044 --> 15:23.715
garden gnome?

15:26.134 --> 15:27.134
So, just me?

15:29.387 --> 15:30.806
Luke, I am so

15:30.807 --> 15:32.223
disappointed in you.

15:32.349 --> 15:34.076
- I always thought - the best part of
- Having siblings

15:34.100 --> 15:35.748
Must be having

15:35.749 --> 15:37.395
someone to stick up

15:34.100 --> 15:37.395
for you, you know?

15:37.521 --> 15:38.585
Ravi did his part.

15:38.586 --> 15:39.648
Now it's your turn.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.129
But I can't!

15:41.130 --> 15:42.484
You just don't get it.

15:44.862 --> 15:46.176
Jessie, since

15:46.177 --> 15:47.489
you were an only child,

15:47.614 --> 15:49.491
- who stuck up
- for you in school?

15:49.616 --> 15:51.417
- My Dad. Yeah, - he'd show up
- At my school,

15:51.451 --> 15:52.662
Lob an old avocado

15:52.663 --> 15:53.871
at the cheerleaders

15:51.451 --> 15:53.871
and yell,

15:54.037 --> 15:55.539
"Fire in the hole!"

15:55.664 --> 15:57.207
You've never seen

15:57.208 --> 15:58.750
a pyramid topple so fast.

15:58.876 --> 15:59.918
(LAUGHS EVILLY)

16:02.170 --> 16:04.255
Sometimes you scare me.

16:09.260 --> 16:10.303
Hey, Wittle Wavi,

16:10.428 --> 16:11.930
- wanna play
- some dodge-bear?

16:13.515 --> 16:15.433
(KIDS LAUGHING)

16:17.394 --> 16:19.062
Hey! Everyone!

16:21.606 --> 16:22.606
Listen up.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.861
- Kenny doesn't
- belong to Ravi.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.070
He's mine.

16:27.071 --> 16:28.071
(GASPS)

16:28.196 --> 16:29.427
Luke, you do not

16:29.428 --> 16:30.657
have to do this.

16:30.782 --> 16:31.825
Yes, I do.

16:33.243 --> 16:34.453
Kenny's been with me

16:34.454 --> 16:35.662
since I was a baby.

16:35.787 --> 16:37.288
He hangs out on my bed,

16:37.414 --> 16:38.974
- sometimes I bring him
- to the dentist

16:39.082 --> 16:40.292
When I'm nervous

16:40.293 --> 16:41.501
because I haven't flossed.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.444
In fact, the only person

16:46.445 --> 16:49.384
who's been a better friend

16:43.503 --> 16:49.384
to me than Kenny is Ravi.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.677
So quit making fun

16:50.678 --> 16:51.845
of my little brother.

16:51.970 --> 16:52.970
GIRLS: Aw!

16:54.681 --> 16:56.182
Whoa, hey.

16:56.307 --> 16:57.308
You know, Kenny and I

16:57.309 --> 16:58.309
have matching sweaters.

17:01.229 --> 17:04.190
They think this is cute?

17:04.315 --> 17:05.858
Classic Luke.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.278
With those freckles

17:07.279 --> 17:08.569
and that charisma,

17:05.983 --> 17:08.569
he makes it work.

17:12.115 --> 17:14.617
So, Shelby, you think

17:14.618 --> 17:17.119
the biggest evil

17:12.115 --> 17:17.119
in the world is yarn?

17:17.244 --> 17:19.204
No, of course not.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.165
It's split ends!

17:21.290 --> 17:23.011
- You should know that
- better than anyone.

17:25.670 --> 17:27.672
Fail much?

17:30.467 --> 17:31.802
Hey, Rosie.

17:31.927 --> 17:32.552
Does this look okay?

17:32.677 --> 17:34.178
Perfect.

17:34.304 --> 17:36.014
- Now can you tell me
- what we're doing?

17:36.139 --> 17:37.828
Emma, I am the artist,

17:37.829 --> 17:39.517
you are the art.

17:39.643 --> 17:41.269
- This will work best
- if you just try

17:41.394 --> 17:42.955
- And keep your mind
- completely blank.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.188
Sorry, what was that?

17:45.273 --> 17:46.733
- I was thinking
- about headbands.

17:49.152 --> 17:50.403
See? You're a natural.

17:52.447 --> 17:54.449
Well, most of you.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.097
All right, show time.

17:56.098 --> 17:57.619
Hop in the box.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.415
Just move your mouth

18:02.416 --> 18:03.416
up and down

18:01.414 --> 18:03.416
when I pull the cord.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.669
Like this?

18:05.794 --> 18:07.129
Who needs brains

18:07.130 --> 18:08.463
when you're pretty?

18:08.588 --> 18:10.465
(LAUGHING)

18:10.590 --> 18:12.342
What do we have here?

18:12.467 --> 18:13.510
We object

18:13.511 --> 18:14.552
to the fact that

18:12.467 --> 18:14.552
women are judged

18:14.678 --> 18:16.054
based on their looks

18:16.055 --> 18:17.430
rather than

18:14.678 --> 18:17.430
what's in their heads.

18:17.555 --> 18:18.890
Too true.

18:19.016 --> 18:20.351
I, for one, was judged

18:20.352 --> 18:21.685
harshly in the art world

18:21.810 --> 18:23.062
when I went

18:23.063 --> 18:24.312
through an unfortunate

18:21.810 --> 18:24.312
sweat pant phase.

18:25.856 --> 18:27.587
It's better to be

18:27.588 --> 18:29.317
beautiful than nice.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.194
(LAUGHING)

18:31.235 --> 18:33.342
Hey! That's my voice,

18:33.343 --> 18:35.448
but I never said that!

18:35.573 --> 18:36.929
Um, Emma

18:36.930 --> 18:38.284
seems a bit upset.

18:38.409 --> 18:39.703
I want out!

18:39.828 --> 18:41.852
Um, what she means

18:41.853 --> 18:43.874
is that she wants out,

18:43.999 --> 18:45.418
out of this role

18:45.419 --> 18:46.835
she's been forced to play.

18:48.378 --> 18:49.713
(LAUGHING)

18:54.759 --> 18:55.844
Wait!

18:55.969 --> 18:57.428
Take me with you!

19:02.934 --> 19:04.102
- Ready to do
- some homework?

19:04.227 --> 19:05.437
Close, close, close,

19:05.438 --> 19:06.646
close, close!

19:06.771 --> 19:08.440
Help! Help!

19:08.441 --> 19:10.108
Nanny gone berserk!

19:10.233 --> 19:11.953
- Where's Gloria Allred
- when you need her?

19:14.404 --> 19:16.656
Sit. Here's the deal.

19:16.781 --> 19:18.012
Neither one of us

19:18.013 --> 19:19.242
is moving until

19:16.781 --> 19:19.242
you finish that homework.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.368
Works for me.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.653
- But don't you
- have tickets

19:21.745 --> 19:22.746
To see that

19:22.747 --> 19:23.747
new musical next month?

19:25.749 --> 19:26.958
- (CHUCKLES)
- One, one second.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.462
(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

19:35.884 --> 19:37.761
- Jessie, please don't
- make me.

19:38.762 --> 19:40.972
All right, sweetie,

19:41.098 --> 19:42.408
- I'm getting the feeling
- this is about more than

19:42.432 --> 19:44.267
- Just not wanting
- to do your homework.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.471
- Why don't you tell me
- what's really bothering you?

19:46.561 --> 19:48.542
Well, third grade

19:48.543 --> 19:50.523
is a lot tougher

19:46.561 --> 19:50.523
than second.

19:50.648 --> 19:51.963
What if I'm not

19:51.964 --> 19:53.276
smart enough

19:50.648 --> 19:53.276
to do the work?

19:53.401 --> 19:54.424
Zuri, you're the smartest

19:54.425 --> 19:55.445
little girl I know.

19:55.570 --> 19:56.770
- Look,
- we'll do it together,

19:56.821 --> 19:58.542
- And every time
- you get a question right,

19:58.615 --> 19:59.679
You'll get five extra

19:59.680 --> 20:00.742
minutes of TV time.

19:58.615 --> 20:00.742
How does that sound?

20:00.867 --> 20:02.348
Well, I usually prefer

20:02.349 --> 20:03.828
my bribes in cash,

20:03.954 --> 20:05.142
but I can get

20:05.143 --> 20:06.330
behind TV time.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.796
Emma, what's going on?

20:12.921 --> 20:15.256
You look like Ken died.

20:15.381 --> 20:16.800
Rosie humiliated me

20:16.801 --> 20:18.217
in front of

20:15.381 --> 20:18.217
the entire school.

20:18.342 --> 20:19.136
I'm so sorry.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.054
I remember one time,

20:21.179 --> 20:22.782
- Darla embarrassed me
- in front of my whole school.

20:22.806 --> 20:24.617
- It was laundry day - and I was wearing
- Granny underpants.

20:24.641 --> 20:25.705
(DOORBELL RINGS)

20:25.706 --> 20:26.768
Saved by the bell.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.481
- Emma... - I don't want
- To talk to you!

20:31.606 --> 20:33.546
Emma, is this the girl

20:33.547 --> 20:35.485
who's being mean to you?

20:35.610 --> 20:36.987
Yeah.

20:37.112 --> 20:39.030
Listen, you.

20:39.156 --> 20:40.740
- There's two things
- I'm good at.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.013
Eating cookies

20:42.014 --> 20:43.160
and kicking butt.

20:43.284 --> 20:44.869
- And we're all
- out of cookies!

20:44.995 --> 20:46.704
Oh, okay, okay, okay!

20:47.538 --> 20:48.748
(NERVOUS LAUGHTER)

20:48.873 --> 20:50.541
- Tenacious Z
- and I will just be

20:50.667 --> 20:51.772
In the screening room,

20:51.773 --> 20:52.877
watching some TV.

20:53.003 --> 20:55.046
Not eavesdropping. Much.

20:55.880 --> 20:59.009
This is not over!

20:59.509 --> 21:01.552
I like her.

21:01.678 --> 21:02.679
What do you need

21:02.680 --> 21:03.680
to say to me?

21:03.805 --> 21:05.578
Well, first, I wanted

21:05.579 --> 21:07.350
to say that we got an A,

21:07.433 --> 21:08.664
and you dropped

21:08.665 --> 21:09.894
your double-D.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.419
Also, I wanted

21:13.420 --> 21:15.233
to apologize.

21:15.358 --> 21:16.836
- I didn't mean
- to hurt your feelings.

21:16.860 --> 21:18.111
Well, you did!

21:18.236 --> 21:19.467
I am so taking back

21:19.468 --> 21:20.697
my friend request!

21:20.822 --> 21:22.449
I was going to accept,

21:22.450 --> 21:24.075
but my grandma won't

21:20.822 --> 21:24.075
get off our computer.

21:24.201 --> 21:26.220
- She's always looking - for a boyfriend on
- That dating website,

21:26.244 --> 21:27.871
I've Fallen In Love

21:27.872 --> 21:29.497
And I Can't Get Up.

21:29.622 --> 21:30.686
Why would you

21:30.687 --> 21:31.749
embarrass me like that?

21:31.875 --> 21:33.418
I was trying to

21:33.419 --> 21:34.961
make a statement about

21:31.875 --> 21:34.961
people like you and Shelby.

21:35.086 --> 21:36.420
I'm nothing like Shelby!

21:36.546 --> 21:38.506
My shirts say "Emma."

21:38.631 --> 21:40.884
And, unlike Shelby,

21:40.885 --> 21:43.136
I tried to be nice to you.

21:43.261 --> 21:44.972
I know. I... I guess

21:44.973 --> 21:46.681
I just never thought

21:46.806 --> 21:48.100
someone like me could

21:48.101 --> 21:49.392
hurt someone like you.

21:49.517 --> 21:51.019
Your life is so perfect.

21:51.144 --> 21:52.729
My life isn't perfect.

21:52.854 --> 21:54.461
My nanny was just

21:54.462 --> 21:56.066
giving me a speech

21:52.854 --> 21:56.066
about her underpants.

21:56.191 --> 21:57.234
Yeah, she's weird.

22:00.278 --> 22:02.135
The truth is...

22:02.136 --> 22:03.990
I'm jealous, all right?

22:04.115 --> 22:06.534
I mean, you live here,

22:06.659 --> 22:08.411
and you look like that,

22:08.536 --> 22:10.393
and you're so nice,

22:10.394 --> 22:12.249
and I just wanna

22:08.536 --> 22:12.249
smack you all the time!

22:13.541 --> 22:15.668
Please don't.

22:15.793 --> 22:17.462
If you really

22:17.463 --> 22:19.130
want to smack someone,

22:15.793 --> 22:19.130
may I suggest Shelby?

22:19.256 --> 22:21.674
She is puke-ular.

22:22.759 --> 22:24.052
Totally.

22:24.177 --> 22:25.220
And you know what?

22:25.428 --> 22:27.055
- I think your
- fashion statements rock.

22:27.180 --> 22:29.557
Really? Thanks!

22:29.682 --> 22:31.205
Do you wanna borrow my skirt

22:31.206 --> 22:32.727
I made out of compost?

22:32.852 --> 22:34.771
Uh, I think

22:34.772 --> 22:36.689
that's more for spring.

22:36.814 --> 22:37.858
Hey! We both love fashion

22:37.859 --> 22:38.900
and hate Shelby.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.736
Yeah. Maybe we do have

22:40.737 --> 22:42.445
something in common.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.572
Told you so!

22:44.697 --> 22:45.741
Do you mind? I'm trying

22:45.742 --> 22:46.783
to talk to my friend!

22:46.908 --> 22:49.494
Ugh! Don't you hate it

22:49.495 --> 22:52.080
when your nanny and butler

22:46.908 --> 22:52.080
eavesdrop on you?

22:52.205 --> 22:53.831
- Okay, if we're
- going to be friends,

22:53.957 --> 22:55.333
Please cool it with the

22:55.334 --> 22:56.709
rich people problems.

22:53.957 --> 22:56.709
It's really annoying.

22:58.461 --> 22:59.701
- I used to feel
- the same way.

22:59.754 --> 23:00.922
Try the massage chairs

23:00.923 --> 23:02.090
in the screening room.

23:02.215 --> 23:03.536
- (CHUCKLES)
- You'll get over it.

23:05.343 --> 23:07.011
- And sometimes,
- when I watch a movie

23:07.137 --> 23:08.639
Where a doggie and

23:08.640 --> 23:10.140
kitty make friends,

23:10.265 --> 23:11.684
I cry a little.

23:11.685 --> 23:13.101
GIRLS: Aw.

23:13.226 --> 23:14.644
Do not think less of me.

23:14.769 --> 23:15.979
ALL: Aw!

23:19.857 --> 23:21.318
Nice work, bro.

23:21.484 --> 23:22.819
I'm proud of you.

23:22.944 --> 23:25.155
Yes, vulnerability is

23:25.156 --> 23:27.365
catnip to the ladies.

23:27.490 --> 23:28.491
Next week, I will

23:28.492 --> 23:29.492
fake a sports injury.
