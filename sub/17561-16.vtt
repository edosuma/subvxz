00:02.335 --> 00:03.920
You know, the one great thing
about me breaking up with Vince

00:04.003 --> 00:07.132
is all the quality time that
we've gotten to spend together.

00:07.215 --> 00:08.383
Do you realize that we've spent

00:08.466 --> 00:11.302
every single day together
this week?

00:11.386 --> 00:13.596
Wow.
Only a week?

00:15.348 --> 00:16.641
Sweetie, he's just frustrated

00:16.725 --> 00:18.059
because I told him
that I wanted to wait

00:18.143 --> 00:20.812
until our wedding night to,
you know.

00:20.895 --> 00:23.773
[chuckles]
Oh, I know.

00:24.774 --> 00:26.818
And I know.

00:28.069 --> 00:30.822
But it is only
because waiting will make it

00:30.905 --> 00:32.531
so much more special.

00:32.615 --> 00:33.992
Kind of old-fashioned.

00:34.075 --> 00:35.410
Yeah, well, baby,
if you want old-fashioned

00:35.493 --> 00:38.705
I could dress up like
Abe Lincoln.

00:38.788 --> 00:40.248
I just want to say
that this is very

00:40.331 --> 00:42.792
uncomfortable for me.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.628
Baby, uh, you're just gonna
have to be patient, okay?

00:45.712 --> 00:47.422
I mean, look at me.
I want to be with you

00:47.505 --> 00:48.965

want to be with me.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.368
- I'll see you in the morning.
- 0800, sir.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.078
Yeah, well,
if my date goes well

10:21.162 --> 10:25.041
expect me at 0830.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.625
Carney, what's the matter?
You look a little down.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.128
Well, it's my second day
on the job, Officer Rubin

10:29.211 --> 10:31.714
and my handcuffs
are still in the wrapper.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.424
Yeah, well, listen
don't worry about that

10:33.507 --> 10:35.718
because I bet you tomorrow
there's gonna be a crack dealer.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.678
- With your name on him.
- You think?

10:37.762 --> 10:40.348
Oh, I hope he puts up a fight.

10:44.518 --> 10:45.978
I mean, if Vince
and I were friends

10:46.062 --> 10:47.563
then we could go to, like

10:47.646 --> 10:49.273
a park or a movie

10:49.357 --> 10:50.733
or a Broadway show

10:50.816 --> 10:53.194
or the Ice Capades.

10:53.277 --> 10:54.570
Just taste this,
tell me if this is not

10:54.653 --> 11:00.659
the best-tasting cheap wine
you've ever tried.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.286
Can I see some I.D.?

11:02.370 --> 11:05.081
Officer, you flatter me.

11:05.164 --> 11:06.624
I'm talkin' to her.

11:06.707 --> 11:09.251
You bastard.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.962
Officer, I wasn't drinking it.
I was just tasting it.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.673
Yeah. It's okay, honey.
I'm taking care of her.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.300
You gave it to her?

11:16.384 --> 11:18.552
Yeah.
That's right.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.057
I only took one sip.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.226
It was peer pressure.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.772
Well, this is insane.

11:29.855 --> 11:33.734
The kid, had a toothache.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.403
Sorry,
but in the state of New York

11:35.486 --> 11:37.988
offering alcohol
to a minor is a crime.

11:38.072 --> 11:39.365
The only crime here

11:39.448 --> 11:41.492
is taking a picture of me
from that angle.

11:41.575 --> 11:42.952
I'm gonna look like Nick Nolte.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.579
Now, come on, take it again.

11:57.216 --> 12:00.511
Okay, candles, flowers.

12:00.594 --> 12:03.264
Chocolates.

12:03.347 --> 12:05.015
Well, I have gone
to a lot of trouble

12:05.099 --> 12:07.226
just to have sex with myself.

12:08.727 --> 12:10.980
[knock on door]

12:11.063 --> 12:13.065
Okay.

12:15.734 --> 12:16.861
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:16.944 --> 12:17.987
Sorry I'm late.

12:18.070 --> 12:20.698
But I'm here now,
and I'm all yours.

12:20.781 --> 12:22.199
Just you and me.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.535
Alright, in that case
may I take your coat?

12:24.618 --> 12:26.954
- May I pour you some champagne?
- Yes.

12:27.037 --> 12:29.331
And may I have sex with you?

12:29.415 --> 12:30.833
No.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.793
Not until I slip
into something pretty.

12:32.877 --> 12:36.172
Ooh, there's a whole outfit
in that teeny little bag?

12:36.255 --> 12:38.424
It's a teeny little outfit.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.761
I am so happy.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.979
Alright, ladies,
you are free to go

12:52.062 --> 12:54.148
once you pay the $500 bail.

12:54.231 --> 12:58.110
Five hundred dollars?
I don't have $500.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.821
Damn you, pointy boots.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.531
Just calm down, little one.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.701
So, um, Officer Adorable..

13:05.784 --> 13:07.203
...would you like to
accept payment here

13:07.286 --> 13:10.206
or is there a room
in the back with a cot perhaps?

13:11.957 --> 13:13.501
Oh, God, we're
never getting out.

13:13.584 --> 13:15.878
- I'm calling Val.
- No, no, you cannot call Val.

13:15.961 --> 13:18.964
- We're gonna get in trouble.
- We're <i> in</i> trouble.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.008
I know, but Val is worse.
Okay, trust me.

13:21.091 --> 13:22.384
Besides, she and Vic
are doing it.

13:22.468 --> 13:23.636
- Just call Tina.
- I can't.

13:23.719 --> 13:25.387
She and Rube are doing it.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.097
I'll call Gary.
Wait, I can't call Gary.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.558
He lost his cellphone.
I'm calling him anyway.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.809
Maybe he found it.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.631
Why, yes,
that would have been me.

Well, I have your..

14:04.677 --> 14:06.554

Get over here.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.955
But I do want to turn it off.
Hold on.

14:38.252 --> 14:39.503

Wait.

- What?
- Come on, come on.

What did Holly have to say?

to let you know that

has been so--

Holly is in jail.

But I didn't want it to
interfere with our special time.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.441
Okay, wait, wait a second.
Are you insane?

- She's in jail?
- Yeah!

to a family on a farm?

16:29.655 --> 16:31.073
No.
No.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.991
I'm trying to think
of the nicest way

16:33.075 --> 16:34.201
to say something to you here

16:34.284 --> 16:35.744
and I can't really think of one.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.579
No, no, Val I know
what you want to say.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.623
- You do?
- Yes.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.583
You want to divorce me.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.502
No, no, I don't want
to divorce you.

16:43.585 --> 16:48.257
I just, I want us to be
able to see other people.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.134
Honey, I love spending
time with you.

16:50.217 --> 16:51.844
Oh, I know, I know.
I get it.

16:51.927 --> 16:53.220
- You do?
- Yes.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.931
You want me to
spread my wings a little bit.

16:56.014 --> 16:57.766
Yes ,yes.
Yes, I do.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.518
And it's not like
I won't be there for you

16:59.601 --> 17:00.686
when you really need me.

17:00.769 --> 17:03.021
It's just, I need you to be

17:03.105 --> 17:07.776
able to figure out maybe two,
three things on your own.

17:07.859 --> 17:10.487
That would be really helpful.

17:10.570 --> 17:12.364
Three things?

17:12.448 --> 17:15.409
Okay, no, no, no.
I can do that.

17:15.492 --> 17:18.119
Wow, prison really
changes a person.

17:18.203 --> 17:21.790
Val, I learned some
stuff in the slammer.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.125
And I really figured out

17:23.208 --> 17:25.794
that Vince and I aren't ready
to be friends.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.546
But I-I've got it covered.

to get jiggy with Vic.

- No, she said "jiggy".

what I mean.

You're the best.

still have that hotel room

Yes?

Oh, of course.
No, we'll take it.

Okay, yes, thank you.

And, uh, give
my condolences to the bride.

- Great, let's go.

in two weeks.

Let's go.

one who's going?

our wedding night, don't you?

Yes, I do, come on,
it will be so much more special.

I just can't say "no" to you.

But you can say "no" to me.

So are you.

19:13.485 --> 19:16.154
Vince, um..

19:16.238 --> 19:18.115
I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

19:18.198 --> 19:21.577
I think it's because what we had
was so intense that..

19:21.660 --> 19:24.371
...it's making it hard for us
just to be friends.

19:24.454 --> 19:26.248
'So I think that we should'

19:26.331 --> 19:29.334
figure out a way
how to not see each other..

19:29.418 --> 19:31.920
...at all.
For a while.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.589
And I know it's gonna be hard

19:33.672 --> 19:35.591
what with us living
across the hall--

19:35.674 --> 19:37.926
Holly, Holly, uh..

19:38.010 --> 19:40.053
I think I might
have a solution.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.346
What?

19:41.430 --> 19:43.599
I'm gonna move out of here.

19:45.183 --> 19:46.602
Oh.

19:46.685 --> 19:49.688
Oh, well, that..
That would be great.

19:49.771 --> 19:53.025
I mean, that would solve
the hallway problem.

19:53.108 --> 19:55.861
And I guess if we run
into each other at the bakery

19:55.944 --> 19:59.281
then we'll just um, you know,
see how it goes.

19:59.364 --> 20:02.242
Holly, that meeting
I had today was a..

20:03.869 --> 20:05.996
It was a job offer.

Well, um, that will be great.
I heard it's a nice town.

20:18.717 --> 20:21.970
And you got a job.
Well, that's fantastic.

20:23.805 --> 20:25.807
So, um, okay.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.476
God, yeah.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.978
Yes.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.855
Well, um,
that's a perfect solution.

20:31.939 --> 20:34.358
And so I guess
I'll see you around, then.

20:34.441 --> 20:36.151
Or I won't.
