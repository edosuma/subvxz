00:02.560 --> 00:04.471
<i>I'm running late this morning.</i>

00:04.560 --> 00:07.632
<i>I've been working</i>
<i>with Dr Casey the last few weeks.</i>

00:07.720 --> 00:09.995
<i>He has Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</i>

00:10.080 --> 00:12.469
<i>and he likes to start each day</i>
<i>the same way...</i>

00:14.080 --> 00:17.311
<i>... by touching everything</i>
<i>in his first patient's room.</i>

00:24.840 --> 00:28.515
- Good morning, doctors.
- <i>He touches everything.</i>

00:29.040 --> 00:32.316
I suppose that's how
they say good morning in cuckoo-town.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.072
Pre <i>tty</i> much.

00:34.160 --> 00:37.311
Patients on this wing have
been complaining about noises.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.119
- If it's "bink", I can explain.
- It isn't "bink".

00:40.200 --> 00:42.316
Was it
<i>I come from the land down under</i>

00:42.400 --> 00:45.073
<i>Where women glow and men plunder</i>

00:45.160 --> 00:47.879
- That wasn't me.
- Just figure it out, dammit.

00:47.960 --> 00:50.315
- Do you plunder?
- I have been known to.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.356
What's the noise he's talking about?

00:55.160 --> 00:59.756
- That is a roof toilet.
- You said that like it's normal.

00:59.840 --> 01:02.070
Careful of this guy, he's a...

01:02.160 --> 01:04.879
You're the guy
who's been using up all my soap.

01:04.959 --> 01:07.793
- Yeah, I've got OCD.
- Really? My grandpa had that.

01:07.880 --> 01:11.509
Every morning he'd take a sock, fill
it up with nickels, and beat us.

01:14.080 --> 01:16.674
- That's OCD, right?
- The bad kind.

01:16.760 --> 01:18.910
Who would use this thing?

01:19.000 --> 01:23.516
You kidding? Just picture yourself.
You're standing out here,

01:23.600 --> 01:27.878
out in the open air, then you sit down
and you take stock of your life.

01:28.720 --> 01:31.757
I've had some major epiphanies
on this old girl.

01:31.840 --> 01:35.958
You can't do any soul-searching down
there on those germ-infested crappers.

01:36.040 --> 01:37.758
<i>Damn him, he's right.</i>

01:37.840 --> 01:42.516
I don't want you telling anybody
about my epiphany toilet.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.511
Who am I gonna tell?

01:46.680 --> 01:48.591
Don't even think about it.

01:52.440 --> 01:55.432
And get this,
he calls it his "epiphany" toilet.

01:55.520 --> 01:58.796
- You couldn't pay me to poop there.
- No one's offering.

01:58.880 --> 02:03.192
You're like Dr Casey. He said using
that toilet would be like his Everest.

02:03.840 --> 02:08.311
Using that toilet
would be my Everest.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.076
Yup, that's what he said.

02:16.160 --> 02:18.993
- Ask him.
- No.

02:19.080 --> 02:21.514
JD, Turk wants to ask you something

02:21.600 --> 02:26.037
and it would mean a lot
to the both of us if you said yes.

02:26.120 --> 02:29.157
<i>Oh, my God, would I have</i>
<i>a threesome with Turk and Carla?</i>

02:29.920 --> 02:32.912
<i>It's flattering and</i>
<i>I don't think they'd tell anyone...</i>

02:33.000 --> 02:35.309
Will you be my best man?

02:37.920 --> 02:41.754
- I mean, yeah! Of course.
- Hell, yeah, you will.

02:43.600 --> 02:47.195
So, is this like, the best moment
you guys have ever had?

02:51.920 --> 02:53.831
A decoder ring.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.996
- Turk?
- What?

03:00.080 --> 03:02.674
- It finally happened!
- A double prizer?

03:08.200 --> 03:12.079
- That was awesome.
- You guys realise you're doctors?

03:12.160 --> 03:15.550
Double secret decoder-ring
wearing doctors.

03:15.640 --> 03:18.871
- Activate.
- Form of an ice menorah.

03:35.880 --> 03:39.793
<i>The reason I'm gurney-surfing,</i>
<i>aside from the fact that it's bitching,</i>

03:39.880 --> 03:42.553
<i>is that Kelso shut down this whole wing.</i>

03:42.640 --> 03:44.437
- I gotta go.
- Oh, no.

03:50.160 --> 03:54.312
<i>You see, a census said that hospital</i>
<i>admissions dropped in Februa</i> ry.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.834
<i>The census was wrong.</i>

03:57.280 --> 04:00.078
Dr Kelso, where are we gonna fit
these sick people?

04:00.160 --> 04:02.958
It's not my job
to take care of sick people.

04:03.040 --> 04:05.235
Bob Kelso, healer.

04:05.320 --> 04:10.075
Closing that wing saves us about
$<i>6</i> 0,000 a month. You got that on you?

04:13.480 --> 04:16.790
<i>It's weird how much Dr Casey</i>
<i>has influenced me in a short time.</i>

04:16.880 --> 04:19.678
- Bink.
- Hey, "bink" you.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.399
<i>It wasn't just me.</i>
<i>Dr Casey's affected eve</i> ry <i>one.</i>

04:22.480 --> 04:25.438
- What's he doing?
- Writing Dr Casey a "thank you" card.

04:25.520 --> 04:27.431
I could use a little help here.

04:27.520 --> 04:30.830
Todd, "surgeon" is spelled G-E-O-N.

04:30.920 --> 04:34.799
And there are two Ds in Todd.

04:39.480 --> 04:45.555
Does... mean stare at me like jackasses
or does it mean "Get over here"?

04:47.520 --> 04:53.152
Mr Tenaka here is fatiguing and he needs
to be intubated. Any questions?

04:53.240 --> 04:55.629
Turk's asked me to be his best man.
Any advice?

04:55.720 --> 04:57.915
No, not at this moment.

04:58.720 --> 05:03.555
Everyone talks about how Dr Casey's
helped them and he doesn't know I exist.

05:03.640 --> 05:07.076
- So, introduce yourself.
- I haven't seen him all day.

05:07.160 --> 05:11.199
He's probably figuring out some
procedure that's gonna save humanity.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.511
Why can't I sit on you?

05:14.920 --> 05:16.592
Why?

05:17.440 --> 05:18.589
Probably.

05:18.680 --> 05:22.116
Newbie, it turns out
I do have some best man advice.

05:22.200 --> 05:25.237
Go easy on the mascara
in case you cry during your toast

05:25.320 --> 05:29.074
and if you chase after the bouquet,
make sure you kick off your pumps

05:29.160 --> 05:32.072
so you don't snap
one of those chicken ankles of yours.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.671
Thanks. Thanks for coming back.

05:35.360 --> 05:37.749
Barbie,
are you sure you went into his lungs?

05:37.840 --> 05:40.638
It looks like
you're blowing up his stomach.

05:40.720 --> 05:43.917
Dammit, his O2 sat's dropping.
Get out of the way, honey.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.355
<i>Even if you've done a procedure</i>
<i>5,000 times,</i>

05:46.440 --> 05:49.318
<i>there's no guarantee</i>
<i>you won't screw up number 5,001.</i>

05:49.400 --> 05:52.790
A few more seconds, we would have
been coding this guy. Take that.

05:52.880 --> 05:57.670
Barbie, as hard as it is to remember,
but air goes in the lungs.

05:58.440 --> 06:02.319
Can I practise my toast on you?
I'm opening with a quote from <i>Spartacus.</i>

06:04.960 --> 06:06.871
Actually, it goes a little lower.

06:07.440 --> 06:11.752
I don't know why Carla wants me to wear
a cumberbund, let alone a red one.

06:11.840 --> 06:15.549
As your best man, trust me, it's not
about the style, it's about the fit.

06:15.640 --> 06:18.916
When you're on the dance floor,
you don't want restrictions.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.389
- Let's test these one more time.
- You ready?

06:21.480 --> 06:23.596
Five, six, seven, eight.

06:23.680 --> 06:27.798
And one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.757
- Drop it like it's hot.
- It is hot!

06:29.840 --> 06:32.070
- Put one hand on the floor.
- I can't reach.

06:32.160 --> 06:34.993
- You better feel the burn.
- I can feel it burning.

06:35.080 --> 06:38.436
Where I grew up,
they didn't allow two men to marry.

06:38.520 --> 06:41.592
- Well, we grew up...
- I grew up in the hood.

06:41.680 --> 06:43.796
...there you gotta do things...

06:43.880 --> 06:45.836
I'm gonna change.

06:45.920 --> 06:49.913
I'm the best man. Do you have any advice
for me to give my friend?

06:50.000 --> 06:53.709
Just remind him that the wedding
is all about what the woman wants.

06:53.800 --> 06:56.758
Yeah, I'll do that. As the best man,
don't you think my tux

06:56.840 --> 06:59.354
should stand out
from the other groomsmen?

06:59.440 --> 07:01.954
What did you have in mind?

07:02.400 --> 07:04.311
The ring, please?

07:04.400 --> 07:07.358
- You got the ring?
- It's gotta be one of these.

07:10.840 --> 07:12.796
I've got ideas.

07:14.440 --> 07:17.113
He's crashing. He needs to be intubated.

07:17.200 --> 07:18.428
Dr Cox!

07:18.520 --> 07:20.954
I've got a billion patients
and no rooms.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.918
Newbie's pestering me for advice
on how to be best woman

07:24.000 --> 07:28.118
at turtle head's wedding and I got a
resident who can't do a simple procedure

07:28.200 --> 07:31.590
even though she learned it
the first week she was here.

07:31.680 --> 07:33.910
I'm sorry, Dr Cox.
I don't know what to do.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.197
I'll tell you what to do.
Get the hell out of here.

07:37.280 --> 07:39.919
Carla, if one more annoying thing
comes my way,

07:40.000 --> 07:45.836
extract that extra air out of Barbie's
head and inject it right into my veins.

07:45.920 --> 07:49.151
Hey, Ace, I want you to find
my gardener, Hector, a room.

07:49.240 --> 07:53.028
He has a case of cellulitis and I need
him in tip-top shape by the weekend.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.190
I'm having my lawn-bowling tournament

07:55.280 --> 07:58.317
and if anyone but Hector cuts my grass
my game goes to heck.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.960
You know we don't have
an extra bed in this dump.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.713
What has two thumbs
and still doesn't give a crap?

08:03.800 --> 08:05.916
Bob Kelso. I though we'd met.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.476
Hector.

08:13.880 --> 08:17.350
This is amazing. I'm your best friend.
Now, I'm your best man.

08:17.440 --> 08:20.398
- What will I be best at next?
- How about not talking?

08:20.480 --> 08:24.268
<i>One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand.</i>
<i>And now I'm best at that.</i>

08:25.800 --> 08:27.711
- Me or him?
- You.

08:28.400 --> 08:31.073
- What now?
- You tell anybody about my toilet?

08:31.160 --> 08:32.832
No. Why?

08:34.640 --> 08:37.438
Where are you coming from?

08:38.840 --> 08:40.034
No.

08:44.159 --> 08:47.675
I find out you told anybody,
I'll beat you with Poppy's nickel sock.

08:47.760 --> 08:52.788
Why would I tell anyone?
And no one has epiphanies on the john.

08:58.120 --> 09:01.669
Of course, it's so simple.

09:07.080 --> 09:12.108
Carla, good. Would you tell Hector that
he can stay just as long as he likes?

09:12.200 --> 09:13.713
Aye, aye, captain.

09:13.800 --> 09:17.110
<i>When two people collide,</i>
<i>a lot of things can happen.</i>

09:17.200 --> 09:19.555
What the hell is going on in here?

09:19.640 --> 09:23.235
Hey, Bob, great news.
We found Hector a room.

09:24.440 --> 09:29.150
<i>For some, it can be disaster.</i>
<i>For others, it's salvation.</i>

09:29.240 --> 09:31.435
I need help.

09:31.520 --> 09:33.431
Excuse me?

09:36.800 --> 09:38.916
Could you not point that at me?

09:39.000 --> 09:40.319
Sure.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.311
Hi, I'm Kevin.

09:44.440 --> 09:46.396
I know!

09:47.080 --> 09:48.354
I know.

09:50.400 --> 09:55.872
<i>The weirdest thing is when two people</i>
<i>collide without being in the same room.</i>

09:55.960 --> 09:58.997
<i>Turk, it's your brother.</i>
<i>My business trip got cancelled</i>

09:59.080 --> 10:04.074
<i>so I can be your best man after all.</i>
<i>I'm looking forward to it. Call me.</i>

10:09.840 --> 10:13.230
<i>I was hurt when I found out I was</i>
<i>Turk's second choice for best man,</i>

10:13.320 --> 10:15.231
<i>but I'm not gonna be petty.</i>

10:15.320 --> 10:19.279
<i>When the tux guy called to confirm</i>
<i>Turk's measurements. I gave them to him.</i>

10:19.360 --> 10:23.114
Dude, I look like
I'm going to Farrakhan day camp.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.270
Paint your legs black, you'll be fine.

10:25.360 --> 10:27.954
Look at this lame-ass bow tie
and cumberbund.

10:28.040 --> 10:32.158
I'm really thinking about talking to
Carla about this. What do you think?

10:32.240 --> 10:36.358
Just remind him that the wedding
is all about what the woman wants.

10:36.760 --> 10:38.637
You should totally say something.

10:38.720 --> 10:42.110
Unless you want to set a precedent
where she walks all over you

10:42.200 --> 10:46.273
for the rest of your life, but it's your
call. You might love that.

10:48.720 --> 10:52.998
I wanted those red cumberbunds
because that's the theme!

10:53.080 --> 10:55.753
- Red is a theme?
- Love is the theme!

10:55.840 --> 10:57.956
We're in love, you idiot.

10:58.040 --> 11:02.795
Why make a big deal about something
we both know you don't even care about?

11:03.960 --> 11:05.871
I don't know.

11:09.360 --> 11:13.273
I better get to work
before all the good patients are taken.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.953
So tell me, is it harder
being a surgeon or a doctor?

11:21.040 --> 11:24.271
A surgeon, cos when you
tell people that a loved one died,

11:24.360 --> 11:27.955
you have to pull your surgical mask down
and you shake your head.

11:28.040 --> 11:30.270
If you do it too fast, it says,

11:30.360 --> 11:35.070
"I knew he was gonna die." And if
you take too long of a pause with it,

11:35.160 --> 11:38.357
it gives them false hope.
So you have to do it perfectly.

11:39.880 --> 11:41.472
Damn.

11:41.920 --> 11:46.038
If one of my loved ones ever dies,
I hope it's because of you.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.391
Hey, me too.

11:49.120 --> 11:52.032
- Are we flirting?
- Little bit.

11:52.800 --> 11:53.789
Awesome.

11:53.880 --> 11:57.668
- Have you seen the roof toilet?
- No, but I'm a nervous pooer.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.637
Now we're definitely not flirting.

11:59.720 --> 12:04.635
I'm more comfortable with the setup
I have at home. Like extra locks.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.757
I've only gone outside my house twice.
Once on an airplane

12:07.840 --> 12:10.957
- and once at the White House.
- How are the bathrooms there?

12:11.040 --> 12:15.352
No idea, but the fountains are nice.
And security? Quick as bunnies.

12:16.080 --> 12:21.074
I know you've helped out a lot of people
and I've got this intubating problem...

12:21.200 --> 12:23.509
- I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

12:25.520 --> 12:27.431
To climb a mountain.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.157
This is completely unacceptable!

12:32.240 --> 12:34.879
- You said find him a room.
- Not my office, dammit!

12:34.960 --> 12:36.712
He's your gardener!

12:36.800 --> 12:38.711
I could have both of you suspended.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.598
You closed an entire wing.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.794
Did you hear what I said
about being suspended?

12:47.880 --> 12:51.077
You made your own bed,
now your gardener's gotta sleep in it.

12:51.160 --> 12:54.357
Fine. Get out of here.
I'll get some paperwork done.

12:59.840 --> 13:03.150
Tell me you're not
waiting to use my roof toilet.

13:03.240 --> 13:07.153
I would use Dr Kelso's,
but I don't wanna wake up Hector.

13:07.240 --> 13:10.232
OK, attention, roof poopers.

13:11.200 --> 13:16.399
Setting aside the fact that I'll make
sure you all live to regret this day,

13:16.480 --> 13:18.550
let's keep the magic rolling.

13:18.640 --> 13:21.632
Let's not tell anyone else
there's a toilet on the roof.

13:21.720 --> 13:24.917
- There is not a toilet on the roof.
- You just said there was.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.833
No. Yes, I did,
but I was using a metaphor.

13:27.920 --> 13:31.435
That means "God is watching us."

13:31.520 --> 13:35.798
You've heard this,
"There's a toilet on the roof."

13:35.880 --> 13:39.509
- Right, people?
- That's right. Ain't nothing up there.

13:41.600 --> 13:42.589
Cool.

13:45.520 --> 13:49.149
<i>It's time to stop feeling sor</i> ry
<i>for yourself. You're still best man.</i>

13:49.240 --> 13:51.879
<i>It's not like Turk's</i>
<i>gonna take that away from you.</i>

13:51.960 --> 13:55.475
JD, can I talk to you?
Have you seen Carla around?

13:55.560 --> 13:57.391
<i>False alarm.</i>

13:57.480 --> 14:01.314
Cos I need to talk to you in private,
sort of man-to-man.

14:02.280 --> 14:04.874
I can't right now, Turk,
I am completely swamped.

14:04.960 --> 14:08.839
- Drawing lightning-bolts on your Nikes?
- To get to my patients faster.

14:08.920 --> 14:11.036
- How about later?
- Later's no good.

14:11.120 --> 14:16.069
I gotta finish telling my whole family
that you picked me as your best man.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.396
- This is hard.
- Sorry it took me so long.

14:22.480 --> 14:25.756
I had to go home.
Damn roof toilet. It's got my number.

14:25.840 --> 14:29.799
- Can't lick it?
- God, no. I can't even sit on it.

14:30.720 --> 14:33.598
Look, that problem
I was talking about before.

14:33.680 --> 14:38.037
I can't intubate patients anymore.
I used to do that better than anyone.

14:38.120 --> 14:41.351
Now, the only thing that sets me apart
is that my beeper plays,

14:41.440 --> 14:44.273
<i>That's the way,</i>
<i>uh-huh, uh-huh, I like it</i>

14:45.720 --> 14:48.678
- I don't know what to do.
- It's just a piece of porcelain.

14:48.760 --> 14:51.752
There's no reason
we both shouldn't be able to sit on it.

14:51.840 --> 14:54.912
Yeah, about my career-ending problem...

14:55.000 --> 14:58.390
- We must conquer the roof toilet.
- Enough about the roof toilet!

14:58.480 --> 15:03.031
I've heard about how amazing you are.
I'm not leaving until you help me out.

15:03.120 --> 15:05.031
Dammit. I have to go.

15:05.360 --> 15:08.989
Elliot. I'll help you.

15:09.080 --> 15:10.433
Thanks.

15:11.720 --> 15:16.953
"If Sacred Heart Elementary for Girls
does not change its name post-haste..."

15:17.040 --> 15:19.315
I thought that was a nice touch.

15:19.400 --> 15:22.119
"...legal action
will be taken post-haste."

15:22.200 --> 15:24.475
- Wait, that's wrong.
- Shocker.

15:24.560 --> 15:27.279
I can't think straight
with this whispering.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.749
It's like a Spanish
golf tournament in here.

15:29.840 --> 15:33.276
I'm sorry, Dr Kelso, but
I'm trying to get their lunch orders.

15:33.360 --> 15:38.912
That reminds me. Hector, Enid made you
a prosciutto and mozzarella sandwich,

15:39.000 --> 15:44.199
but I... There was a misunderstanding,
and now it's gone.

15:51.880 --> 15:55.475
I forget. Is <i>que se joda</i>
kill him or screw him?

15:55.560 --> 15:57.471
Screw him.

16:06.720 --> 16:09.359
That's it!
I just have to go and talk to him.

16:12.160 --> 16:14.993
- Kevin Casey.
- Dr Casey, have you seen Turk?

16:15.080 --> 16:19.437
Oh, yeah. Nice guy.
Good surgeon. Great dancer.

16:19.520 --> 16:23.957
You should see us getting down
when we try pants on together.

16:24.040 --> 16:26.315
- I have to go.
- Cool. I'll see you tomorrow?

16:26.400 --> 16:28.994
Actually, no.
I have to go back to my hospital.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.548
- Why do you have to do that?
- Look at it this way.

16:31.640 --> 16:35.872
I may be leaving here,
but I will always be there.

16:36.280 --> 16:38.748
- I know.
- I am so messing with you.

16:38.840 --> 16:42.913
OK, it was amazing to work with you.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.274
Thank you.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.555
- And that's three seconds.
- OK. Sorry.

16:48.640 --> 16:53.191
<i>Watching him go, I wondered how gay I</i>
<i>looked giving that two-handed handshake.</i>

16:53.280 --> 16:56.397
<i>And how weird it was that someone</i>
<i>could walk into your life,</i>

16:56.480 --> 17:01.076
<i>have such a big impact and then vanish</i>
<i>just like that, never to be seen again.</i>

17:01.160 --> 17:03.720
<i>But mostly,</i>
<i>I thought about how, in some way,</i>

17:03.800 --> 17:06.314
<i>Kevin had helped</i>
<i>eve</i> ry <i>person he met here.</i>

17:13.839 --> 17:16.559
Kevin? Has anybody seen Kevin?

17:24.160 --> 17:26.070
<i>Where the hell is Turk?</i>

17:30.720 --> 17:32.631
What's wrong?

17:34.040 --> 17:36.918
Kevin left. Didn't even say goodbye.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.788
He didn't say goodbye to a lot
of people. Just me, Dr Cox, Carla,

17:40.880 --> 17:43.792
Doug, Snoop Dogg intern.

17:43.880 --> 17:46.758
- Where are my hos at?
- I haven't seen them.

17:46.840 --> 17:50.276
I don't want to sound pathetic,
but he didn't even help me.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.557
He didn't help a lot of people.
It was just me and Turk and Carla

17:53.640 --> 17:55.596
and Dr Cox and Doug and Dr Mickhead.

17:55.680 --> 18:00.117
- Mickhead? No, Mickhead's in rehab.
- Was in rehab, Elliot, was.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.794
He'll never huff paint again.

18:02.880 --> 18:06.475
But look, if you need help
I'm always here for you.

18:07.440 --> 18:08.714
All right.

18:08.800 --> 18:12.076
With intubating, I can't seem
to intubate patients anymore.

18:12.160 --> 18:14.071
There's Turk, I gotta go.

18:20.840 --> 18:22.751
- Elliot?
- Aunt Lillian?

18:23.360 --> 18:24.679
Aunt Lillian?

18:24.760 --> 18:27.035
What is it, Barbie?

18:27.120 --> 18:29.270
- I need help.
- I know you do, sweetie,

18:29.360 --> 18:33.433
but I'm out of hair scrunchies. Scram,
we're waiting for somebody.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.033
Go on.

18:35.120 --> 18:39.159
Hector's wife just set my drapes on fire
with her damn prayer candle.

18:39.240 --> 18:42.277
- He's here.
- I want them both out of my office.

18:42.360 --> 18:47.150
There's a ton of empty beds right here.
All you have to do is flick the switch.

18:47.240 --> 18:52.268
You know how to do that, don't you, Bob?
You just bend over and flick.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.677
I thought so.

20:10.920 --> 20:12.831
Who took this?

20:22.680 --> 20:26.753
With Mulberry, I really believe
New York has a shot at the title, man.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.034
Yeah, me too.

20:28.120 --> 20:31.476
- What sport are we talking about?
- I wanna say tennis.

20:32.680 --> 20:36.832
Turk, I heard the message
that your brother left on the machine.

20:36.920 --> 20:41.118
I want you to know if there's anything I
can do to make your wedding go smoother,

20:41.200 --> 20:46.718
just tell me. Even if
it's stepping down from being best man.

20:46.800 --> 20:51.237
The only reason I asked my brother
was because I knew he couldn't come.

20:51.320 --> 20:55.108
Now I'm screwed because his plans
have changed and he's all excited.

20:55.200 --> 20:58.829
But, dude, it has to be you,
you know that.

20:58.920 --> 21:02.708
<i>It's uncomfortable when two guys</i>
<i>want to say something to each other.</i>

21:03.120 --> 21:05.953
- You've been my best friend...
- You're my friend...

21:06.040 --> 21:08.600
- Man, I love you.
- I've known you since college.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.557
- Cool.
- Solid.

21:10.640 --> 21:16.158
If it makes it easier,
I guess we could be co-best man.

21:16.240 --> 21:18.959
You have no idea
how much stress that would relieve.

21:19.040 --> 21:22.589
Even though,
God says it's supposed to be one.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.874
You think there's more to Dr Kelso
than we know?

21:29.960 --> 21:34.078
Sure. Is he, in fact, a latex-encased
robot with real human hair

21:34.160 --> 21:38.472
and a circuit board where his heart
should be? I can't rule that out.

21:38.560 --> 21:43.350
You know, Hector told me he's worked
for Dr Kelso for 20 years.

21:43.440 --> 21:46.273
That's half his life.
I mean, I know he looks 50,

21:46.360 --> 21:49.397
but that's what being in
the sun all day does to your skin.

21:49.480 --> 21:52.517
Point is, it doesn't seem
like he hates Dr Kelso.

21:52.600 --> 21:57.674
Bob-O, is it possible that you're
occasionally a decent human being

21:57.760 --> 22:00.354
in your life outside of this place?

22:00.440 --> 22:04.194
Well, champ, seeing as you don't exist
in my life outside this place,

22:04.280 --> 22:06.589
I doubt it's any of your damn business.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.994
<i>OK, so far no epiphanies.</i>

22:17.080 --> 22:20.311
<i>Except that outdoor toilet seats</i>
<i>are like frickin' icicles.</i>

22:21.400 --> 22:23.311
<i>At least no one saw me go.</i>

22:41.040 --> 22:42.837
Go! Roll to her!

22:44.600 --> 22:47.433
We don't have a helicopter pad.

22:47.520 --> 22:50.273
We're out of time.
He needs to be intubated, now!

22:50.360 --> 22:53.511
- Just let me get someone.
- Now! You! Let's go! Do it!

22:57.200 --> 22:59.111
Come on!

23:04.520 --> 23:06.431
I'm in.

23:08.360 --> 23:11.432
You see, this is why I wanted
you to use the bathroom up here.

23:12.400 --> 23:16.837
If there's something you know you can
do, whether it's intubating a patient

23:16.920 --> 23:22.358
or copping a squat on the roof, and
your mind keeps throwing up roadblocks,

23:22.440 --> 23:24.954
just know
you can drive right through 'em.

23:26.400 --> 23:30.234
And if that doesn't help,
maybe this will.

23:48.080 --> 23:49.991
I can't believe it's gone.

23:50.080 --> 23:52.275
<i>It's human nature</i>
<i>to search for answers.</i>

23:52.360 --> 23:55.557
Dude, why is your tux gonna cost $4,000?

23:57.200 --> 23:59.031
No reason.

23:59.120 --> 24:03.272
<i>Sometimes the answer you get</i>
<i>is the one you least expect.</i>

24:03.360 --> 24:05.555
All right, pipe down!

24:05.640 --> 24:09.110
- Now, who's up for Dairy Queen?
- Dairy Queen!

24:09.200 --> 24:11.191
<i>But more often than not,</i>

24:11.280 --> 24:15.114
<i>the answers we've been looking for</i>
<i>have been inside us all along.</i>

24:18.720 --> 24:23.032
Well done, there, Barbie. You're now
exactly where you were three years ago.

24:26.520 --> 24:29.557
<i>I guess the important thing</i>
<i>is to never stop searching.</i>

24:30.320 --> 24:31.639
Occupied.
