00:01.601 --> 00:03.036
(upbeat March plays)

00:03.104 --> 00:05.872
* good morning, usa! *

00:05.939 --> 00:09.810
* I got a feeling that it's
gonna be a wonderful day *

00:09.877 --> 00:12.746
* the sun in the sky
has a smile on his face *

00:12.814 --> 00:16.450
* and he's shining a salute
to the american race *

00:18.986 --> 00:22.022
* oh, boy, it's swell to say *

00:22.090 --> 00:24.024
* good morning, usa *

00:24.092 --> 00:26.893
<font color="#ffff00">Captioning sponsored by</font>
<font color="#ffff00">20th century fox television</font>

00:26.961 --> 00:30.397
<font color="#ffff00">And toyota. Moving forward.</font>

00:32.633 --> 00:35.569
Nice! The mobile lab's
back from the garage.

00:35.636 --> 00:36.970
I see they didn't put on

00:37.038 --> 00:39.106
The semi-erotic
mudflaps I suggested.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.340
Can we get on with this?

00:40.408 --> 00:41.908
Yes, of course.

00:41.976 --> 00:44.945
Now, once you're in the brain
of bin laden's cat,

00:45.012 --> 00:47.247
Code name buffy,
you're to find out

00:47.315 --> 00:49.449
If she's overheard
any terrorist intel,

00:49.517 --> 00:53.754
Then ask her why she tries
to scratch me when I pet her.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.088
Does she hate me?

00:55.156 --> 00:56.590
I do everything for her.

00:56.657 --> 00:59.092
You know, ray,
this is highly experimental.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.194
There's no guarantee
you'll come out alive.

01:01.262 --> 01:02.629
What do I care?

01:02.697 --> 01:05.799
My kids are out of the
house. My wife left me.

01:05.867 --> 01:07.968
Very good. Just sign right here.

01:08.035 --> 01:09.202
Ray, you had a wife?

01:09.270 --> 01:10.504
I always thought...

01:10.571 --> 01:11.671
I don't know what I thought.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.173
I never think about you.

01:13.241 --> 01:15.041
Anyway, director bullock, I
have to take off early today.

01:15.109 --> 01:16.676
My kids are leaving
for the summer.

01:16.744 --> 01:19.179
Uh-oh.
This is how it starts.

01:19.247 --> 01:21.982
Ruth and I were happily married
for 25 years,

01:22.049 --> 01:24.184
But when the kids
left for college,

01:24.252 --> 01:26.620
We sat down to dinner
one night and boom!

01:26.687 --> 01:29.923
She realized
how boring I was.

01:29.991 --> 01:31.425
I'm not worried
about that.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.126
Francine will
never leave me.

01:33.194 --> 01:34.361
Oh, yeah?

01:34.429 --> 01:36.430
Without your kids,
you got no buffer.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.899
And you're
more boring than I am!

01:38.966 --> 01:41.701
It's true. No one wants
to eat lunch with you.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.270
Well, even if I am boring,

01:43.337 --> 01:45.105
Francine will never find out.

01:45.173 --> 01:46.440
I've got an ace in the hole.

01:46.507 --> 01:47.774
All right, ray,

01:47.842 --> 01:49.176
You're going
into the cat's mind

01:49.243 --> 01:51.244
In three, two...

01:51.312 --> 01:53.713
(zapping)

01:53.781 --> 01:54.748
He's safely in.

01:54.816 --> 01:55.749
Good.

01:55.817 --> 01:58.618
(blows raspberry)

01:58.686 --> 02:00.987
Anybody else care for a go?

02:01.055 --> 02:02.456
It's super fun.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.126
Have fun at camp, honey.

02:06.194 --> 02:08.794
If anyone needs me,
I'll be living in a tree,

02:08.863 --> 02:10.263
Protesting logging.

02:10.330 --> 02:11.932
No one needs you.

02:11.999 --> 02:15.335
I can't believe my babies are
leaving for the whole summer.

02:15.403 --> 02:16.336
(smooching)

02:16.404 --> 02:17.971
Hit it, hit, it, hit it!

02:18.039 --> 02:19.039
(tires squealing)

02:20.675 --> 02:23.944
And don't write.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

02:24.011 --> 02:25.879
For the first time
in 18 years,

02:25.947 --> 02:28.048
We have the whole house
to ourselves!

02:28.115 --> 02:31.985
Just you and me getting to know
each other all over again.

02:32.053 --> 02:33.453
That sounds great, francine.

02:33.521 --> 02:34.688
But I think you're
forgetting about...

02:34.755 --> 02:35.589
(explosion booming)

02:37.391 --> 02:39.459
...The madman we hide
in the attic.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.294
He requires
our constant attention.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.597
Sorry, honey.
No alone time for us.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.198
Phew. I had to
get out of there.

02:45.266 --> 02:46.766
It really smelled.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.169
I threw up in the shower, and
it didn't go down the drain,

02:49.237 --> 02:51.771
And now the tub's overflowing,
and I want some iced tea,

02:51.839 --> 02:54.207
And I know you
know I want it now!

02:55.676 --> 02:58.345
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.846
(groans)
damn it!

02:59.914 --> 03:01.414
Hey, f-bombs.

03:01.482 --> 03:04.251
Roger, I see you're busy,
but I was thinking it's time

03:04.318 --> 03:06.653
I teach you how to do
some stuff on your own.

03:06.721 --> 03:09.923
The laundry, cleaning,
making your own iced tea...

03:09.991 --> 03:12.726
(plays pitch pipe)

03:12.793 --> 03:14.995
(sings in tune):
* no. *

03:15.062 --> 03:16.696
We can make a game of it.

03:16.764 --> 03:19.032
I'm going to be
colton lansington,

03:19.100 --> 03:21.067
A renegade space cop
who struggles

03:21.135 --> 03:23.403
To keep his
bipolar disorder in check.

03:23.471 --> 03:24.905
Okay, colton.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.407
You just had a busy space day

03:27.475 --> 03:29.509
And now you'd like to cool down

03:29.577 --> 03:31.578
With some intergalactic
iced tea.

03:31.646 --> 03:34.080
Now, you take two
scoops of powder...

03:34.148 --> 03:36.650
Colton doesn't
take orders from nobody!

03:36.717 --> 03:38.418
I'm off my meds!

03:42.023 --> 03:43.924
Well, lookie, lookie.

03:43.991 --> 03:47.260
Seems we've got ourselves a
cabin of bunk-boobs next door.

03:47.328 --> 03:50.430
I'm gonna freshen up, then
make with the introducies.

03:50.498 --> 03:52.532
You're just gonna walk
right up to those girls?

03:52.600 --> 03:54.434
Snotters, this is camp.

03:54.502 --> 03:57.037
We left our reputations
as nerds back home.

03:57.104 --> 03:59.706
It's a chance
to reinvent ourselves.

03:59.774 --> 04:02.042
(in deeper voice):
Hey there. Name's joss.

04:02.109 --> 04:04.344
I'm a tennis player from vegas.

04:04.412 --> 04:07.013
But most people know me
for my niรงoise salad.

04:07.081 --> 04:09.316
(in deep voice):
I'm leo.

04:09.383 --> 04:12.118
I like making love
with the lights on.

04:12.186 --> 04:13.186
Boy:
Geeks!

04:13.254 --> 04:15.121
Get 'em!

04:16.824 --> 04:20.226
Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye! Yah!

04:22.530 --> 04:24.097
You know how
you're always making a mess

04:24.165 --> 04:25.599
And I have to clean it up?

04:25.666 --> 04:27.734
Well, this invention... Roger?

04:27.802 --> 04:30.070
Checkin' out my pow-pow.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.204
Continue.

04:31.272 --> 04:33.306
What up, dink?

04:33.374 --> 04:35.175
Cleaning up
after roger again?

04:35.242 --> 04:37.110
Did he have another
ticker-tape parade

04:37.178 --> 04:39.713
Because the deli finally
named a sandwich after him?

04:39.780 --> 04:43.249
Actually, stan, I'm teaching
roger to be self-sufficient,

04:43.317 --> 04:45.318
So we can finally
have our alone time.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.187
Great.

04:49.023 --> 04:50.223
Now, there are
three settings.

04:50.291 --> 04:51.458
(booming)
(booming)

04:51.525 --> 04:53.627
Roger on a hard roll!

04:53.694 --> 04:55.895
I got problems, fish.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.864
Francine wants to
spend the summer alone,

04:57.932 --> 04:59.165
Just the two of us.

04:59.233 --> 05:03.136
Yeah!
You are going to be sexing!

05:03.204 --> 05:04.738
No, you don't get it.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.807
Francine and I haven't been
alone together in 18 years.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.477
What if she thinks I'm
boring and leaves me?

05:10.544 --> 05:12.479
I knew the kids couldn't
be my buffer forever,

05:12.546 --> 05:14.147
But roger was my
ace in the hole.

05:14.215 --> 05:15.982
If he learns how to
take care of himself,

05:16.050 --> 05:17.917
It'll just be me and francine.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.653
That's why you're stressed?

05:19.720 --> 05:21.054
(laughing)

05:21.122 --> 05:24.758
Stan, it's roger.
He can't do anything on his own.

05:24.825 --> 05:28.228
You'll never have to worry
about being alone with francine.

05:28.295 --> 05:30.130
(laughing)

05:30.197 --> 05:31.398
(both laughing)

05:31.465 --> 05:32.766
You're right.
What am I thinking?

05:32.833 --> 05:33.933
Roger's an idiot.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.402
He can't take care of himself.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.137
He's like a baby.
Or africa!

05:37.204 --> 05:38.371
(both laughing)

05:38.439 --> 05:41.608
That was good.
That was good.

05:41.676 --> 05:43.209
I don't believe it.

05:43.277 --> 05:46.112
We're here two minutes and
already we're branded as nerds.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.081
I can't even wear
my new sandals now!

05:48.149 --> 05:49.249
No one's gonna buy it!

05:49.316 --> 05:50.950
Oh, face it, steve.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.420
No matter where we go,
we're just gonna be...

05:53.487 --> 05:54.854
Losers.

05:54.922 --> 05:57.057
But how'd they
figure it out so fast?

05:57.124 --> 05:58.892
What do these guys got
that we don't?

06:00.394 --> 06:02.996
Oh, my god, that's it.

06:03.064 --> 06:04.831
Boxer shorts!

06:04.899 --> 06:07.300
Fellas, if we want to be cool,

06:07.368 --> 06:09.102
We've got to shed
these whities of tight,

06:09.170 --> 06:12.105
And get ourselves some of those.

06:14.709 --> 06:17.877
Stan, I have a surprise for you!

06:17.945 --> 06:19.379
You know how I've
been training roger

06:19.447 --> 06:20.914
To be more self-sufficient?

06:20.981 --> 06:22.916
Well, guess what he
did this afternoon?

06:22.983 --> 06:24.784
He moved out!

06:24.852 --> 06:26.519
We're finally alone.

06:26.587 --> 06:30.724
No kids, no alien,
just you and me.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.892
Oh, and more good news!

06:32.960 --> 06:35.562
The cable's out and I
just got my period,

06:35.629 --> 06:40.233
So there's nothing to do
but talk and talk and talk.

06:43.757 --> 06:44.691
(whistling)
roger?

06:44.758 --> 06:46.559
(whistling)
come here, boy!

06:46.627 --> 06:49.596
Stan, he's not here.
He got his own place.

06:49.663 --> 06:51.731
Now, let's
go inside and talk.

06:51.799 --> 06:53.800
We can't! We have
to go visit roger.

06:53.868 --> 06:55.668
I got him a
housewarming gift.

06:57.238 --> 06:59.772
This is not from
the both of us.

07:03.777 --> 07:05.778
Stan! Francine!

07:05.846 --> 07:08.615
<i>Buenas noches.
Welcome to mi casa.</i>

07:08.682 --> 07:10.750
Oh, you're
learning spanish?

07:10.818 --> 07:12.218
You got to
in this neighborhood,

07:12.286 --> 07:14.053
If you wanna read
the mcdonald's billboards.

07:14.121 --> 07:15.188
This is for you.

07:15.256 --> 07:17.924
All right.

07:17.992 --> 07:20.159
Well, why don't I
give you the tour?

07:20.227 --> 07:22.629
This room is the kitchen slash
bedroom slash living room

07:22.696 --> 07:23.863
Slash dance studio.

07:23.931 --> 07:26.766
(groaning)

07:26.834 --> 07:28.101
My hammies.

07:28.168 --> 07:30.203
It's wonderful, roger.

07:30.271 --> 07:31.738
How are you paying for this?

07:31.805 --> 07:33.573
I got a job at
colonial pet store.

07:33.641 --> 07:35.275
You? Working?

07:35.342 --> 07:36.576
Francine, pour
yourself a drink.

07:36.644 --> 07:39.545
Stan and I need to talk.

07:39.613 --> 07:41.447
I heard what you said.

07:41.515 --> 07:42.982
That I couldn't do
anything on my own.

07:43.050 --> 07:45.118
Well, look around, jerk.
It's all mine.

07:45.185 --> 07:48.388
And I'll have you know that
I've only called 911 once today,

07:48.455 --> 07:49.989
Because some cholos broke in.

07:50.057 --> 07:52.058
They stole my swimming jeans.

07:52.126 --> 07:54.360
Roger, look, I'm sorry
you heard what I said.

07:54.428 --> 07:56.129
Please, just move back home.

07:56.196 --> 07:57.597
You miss me, huh?

07:57.665 --> 07:59.599
Miss my dana carvey
impersonations?

07:59.667 --> 08:01.167
Well, it's too late, stan.

08:01.235 --> 08:02.635
I'm self-sufficient now.

08:02.703 --> 08:05.271
Get used to it.

08:05.339 --> 08:09.042
I don't want my rug
to smell like smoke.

08:09.109 --> 08:11.210
I'm so proud
of you, roger.

08:11.278 --> 08:13.746
Yeah, you know, they say
if a domestic pig escapes

08:13.814 --> 08:16.282
Into the wild, it will
instinctively grow tusks.

08:16.350 --> 08:17.684
Who says that?

08:17.751 --> 08:20.420
Your mother.

08:20.487 --> 08:22.155
Stan, let's go home.

08:22.222 --> 08:24.390
Roger has a lot of
unpacking to do.

08:24.458 --> 08:27.760
No! I mean, uh, I'm sure roger
wants us to stay for dinner.

08:27.828 --> 08:30.897
That is, unless he's incapable
of making a meal.

08:30.965 --> 08:32.065
(laughing)

08:32.131 --> 08:33.466
Oh, stan.

08:33.534 --> 08:36.736
I've got a freezer full
of shu mai from trader joes.

08:36.804 --> 08:39.472
And for dessert,
a huge-ass box of chocodiles.

08:39.539 --> 08:42.174
I hid them in the fridge
for when the cholos come back.

08:42.241 --> 08:43.743
And they will be back.

08:43.811 --> 08:46.479
I gave the biggest one a key.

08:46.547 --> 08:50.016
Wow. We're finally
alone together.

08:50.084 --> 08:53.286
Tell me something
fascinating about you.

08:53.354 --> 08:55.054
Uh...

08:55.122 --> 08:58.091
My god, I never realized
how boring you are.

08:58.158 --> 08:59.325
I'm leaving you.

08:59.393 --> 09:00.960
You're going to die alone.

09:01.028 --> 09:02.095
(screaming)

09:02.162 --> 09:04.964
(screaming)

09:05.032 --> 09:06.165
What's happening?

09:06.233 --> 09:07.433
You fell asleep at roger's

09:07.501 --> 09:09.469
After you asked him to
count to a million.

09:09.536 --> 09:12.205
We couldn't wake you up,
so I carried you to the car.

09:12.272 --> 09:15.675
Ugh, I ate two boxes of shu mai.

09:15.743 --> 09:17.643
I got the pork sweats.

09:17.711 --> 09:19.379
All right.
I'll be up in a minute.

09:19.446 --> 09:20.847
(burps)

09:20.914 --> 09:22.248
I'm gross.

09:22.316 --> 09:24.283
We were wrong, fish!

09:24.351 --> 09:26.652
Roger's moved out and he's
completely independent.

09:26.720 --> 09:27.754
What am I gonna do?

09:27.821 --> 09:29.188
Ask him to come back.

09:29.256 --> 09:30.690
Yeah...

09:30.758 --> 09:32.291
I'll force him back.

09:32.359 --> 09:34.460
I'll poison roger
and he'll be too sick

09:34.528 --> 09:35.595
To take care of himself.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.196
Then he'll have
to come crawling home.

09:37.264 --> 09:38.264
What?!

09:38.332 --> 09:39.899
All I have to do
is keep him

09:39.967 --> 09:41.934
Weak and needy
until the kids come back.

09:44.605 --> 09:46.606
You monster.
I'll tell on you!

09:53.347 --> 09:54.447
What am I doing?

09:54.515 --> 09:56.382
No!

10:02.122 --> 10:03.389
Roger, what are
you doing here?

10:03.457 --> 10:04.757
Stan invited me for dinner.

10:04.825 --> 10:05.992
He misses me.

10:06.060 --> 10:08.161
Oh, I brought you this.
Tag. You're it.

10:08.228 --> 10:12.131
Stan, you miss roger.
That's so sweet.

10:12.199 --> 10:14.133
You and I can have
alone time tomorrow.

10:14.201 --> 10:15.802
(laughing)

10:15.869 --> 10:17.737
Yes.

10:19.973 --> 10:22.175
To roger's independence.
(clinking)

10:24.812 --> 10:27.280
Oh, I feel awful.

10:27.347 --> 10:28.948
Roger, you should
sleep here tonight.

10:29.016 --> 10:30.917
You're too sick to go home.

10:30.984 --> 10:34.153
But I have to study
my adult dog food manual.

10:34.221 --> 10:37.223
(moaning)

10:39.960 --> 10:44.030
Now, we just go in and tell them
we want men's boxer shorts.

10:44.098 --> 10:46.866
I see you gents are interested
in buying some underwear.

10:46.934 --> 10:49.735
We want to get some boxer
shorts like the cool kids have.

10:49.803 --> 10:52.472
Sure, you can
be followers.

10:52.539 --> 10:54.707
Try and play catch up
to the trends...

10:54.775 --> 10:56.275
Or you could set them.

10:57.744 --> 11:00.146
Name's mr. Clyde timpleton.

11:00.214 --> 11:02.448
Can I buy you boys some lunch?

11:02.516 --> 11:04.684
(deep voice):
I never turn down lunch.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.919
Or a big-ass bitch.

11:06.987 --> 11:08.888
You guys really want
to spin heads

11:08.956 --> 11:12.492
At that camp of yours,
you wear these...

11:12.559 --> 11:13.960
Culottes.

11:14.027 --> 11:16.629
Culottes?
I don't know.

11:16.697 --> 11:18.631
These will make you
superstars.

11:18.699 --> 11:20.700
The cool kids will carry you
through the streets.

11:20.767 --> 11:23.302
Women will go hysterical.

11:23.370 --> 11:26.873
Ooh, the stitching
is wonderful.

11:26.940 --> 11:28.374
You, sir,
have made a sale!

11:28.442 --> 11:29.942
Good, good.

11:30.010 --> 11:34.313
Here. These are thank-you notes
from your nads.

11:37.918 --> 11:40.419
Ray, I read your report
from your time spent

11:40.487 --> 11:41.654
Inside buffy's brain.

11:41.722 --> 11:44.056
Very comprehensive,
well done.

11:44.124 --> 11:47.760
Buffy, I understand
you think I smell "weird,"

11:47.828 --> 11:50.263
But I believe it was
my body wash,

11:50.330 --> 11:52.865
Which I've changed,
so now you should love me.

11:56.370 --> 11:59.172
Now where will you sleep,
you ice queen?!

11:59.239 --> 12:01.941
You think
you're better than me?!

12:02.009 --> 12:03.543
<i>You're not better than me!</i>

12:03.610 --> 12:07.580
You're going to learn
a hard, hard lesson.

12:09.483 --> 12:11.184
(phone rings)

12:11.251 --> 12:12.285
Hello?

12:12.352 --> 12:13.986
How about we go out
to fondue tonight?

12:14.054 --> 12:16.322
You and me
and a nice dinner

12:16.390 --> 12:18.491
Rolling right into cramps
and diarrhea?

12:18.559 --> 12:19.525
What about roger?

12:19.593 --> 12:20.826
He's feeling better.

12:20.894 --> 12:22.728
He's even working
his afternoon shift,

12:22.796 --> 12:25.031
So we're free.

12:25.098 --> 12:27.733
So, ray, uh, how
is it being single?

12:27.801 --> 12:29.802
Eh, not so bad.

12:37.878 --> 12:40.346
Is this food appropriate
for a small dog?

12:40.414 --> 12:42.748
Oh, ma'am, I'm not
qualified to answer that.

12:42.816 --> 12:45.318
See, I only have one mouse
on my name tag,

12:45.385 --> 12:47.486
Which means I do stocking,
lifting and the like.

12:47.554 --> 12:50.056
You need to talk to someone
with at least one dog.

12:50.123 --> 12:52.558
See, it goes one mouse,
two mouse, one bird, two bird,

12:52.626 --> 12:53.993
Then one dog, then two dog.

12:54.061 --> 12:56.429
I hear there's a guy
up in portland with three dogs,

12:56.496 --> 12:58.798
But I think that's just
an office rumor.

12:58.865 --> 13:01.000
Wouldn't it be something
if it was true, though?

13:01.068 --> 13:03.536
Hey, roger!
What's going on?

13:03.604 --> 13:05.605
Not much. Just boring myself
and this old broad.

13:05.672 --> 13:06.772
What's up?

13:06.840 --> 13:08.441
Francine told me
you went to work,

13:08.508 --> 13:10.176
So I thought I'd bring
you a juice

13:10.244 --> 13:11.677
To keep your
immune system up.

13:11.745 --> 13:13.279
Mm, isn't that
nice of you...?

13:13.347 --> 13:17.550
(groaning)
who will feed
the chinchillas?

13:17.618 --> 13:18.651
(shivering)

13:18.719 --> 13:20.486
You're too sick.

13:20.554 --> 13:22.255
We're getting you
out of that apartment

13:22.322 --> 13:23.723
And bringing
you back home.

13:24.725 --> 13:26.158
You're freezing!

13:26.226 --> 13:27.827
I'll get you
some blankets.

13:27.894 --> 13:30.663
Looks like you're
here to stay, roger.

13:30.731 --> 13:33.399
This calls for
a celebration.

13:33.467 --> 13:36.836
Frannie, will you make me
some iced tea?

13:36.903 --> 13:37.870
Stan?

13:37.938 --> 13:40.306
Anybody?

13:40.374 --> 13:41.874
No, you know what?

13:41.942 --> 13:43.276
I can do it myself.

13:50.884 --> 13:55.755
(humming "the can-can song")

13:55.822 --> 13:57.723
(francine screams)

13:57.791 --> 14:00.526
(roger blubbering)

14:00.594 --> 14:02.795
Oh, my god, stan!

14:02.863 --> 14:05.298
Oh, he's doing his
heath ledger impression.

14:05.365 --> 14:07.533
Too soon, roger,
too soon.

14:10.999 --> 14:12.099
How's he doing?

14:12.167 --> 14:13.501
He seems to be stabilized,

14:13.569 --> 14:15.303
But he's not coming out
of the coma.

14:15.370 --> 14:18.339
I guess there's nothing
we can do except wait.

14:18.407 --> 14:19.807
Just the two of us.

14:19.875 --> 14:23.644
Oh, fyi, the cable repairman
canceled on me,

14:23.712 --> 14:26.914
And I'm having one
of my famous ten-day periods.

14:26.982 --> 14:28.015
I have an idea!

14:31.720 --> 14:33.187
You're sure you know
what you're doing?

14:34.456 --> 14:35.723
Roger's in a coma.

14:35.791 --> 14:38.226
All I have to do is
use this device

14:38.293 --> 14:40.995
To go into his brain,
find him in his unconscious,

14:41.063 --> 14:43.064
And bring him over to
the conscious side.

14:43.131 --> 14:44.198
Don't worry, francine,

14:44.266 --> 14:45.900
We do it all the
time with cats.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.101
All right, turn it on.

14:47.169 --> 14:50.771
(whooshing hum)

14:50.839 --> 14:53.941
It worked.
I'm in roger's mind.

14:54.009 --> 14:55.810
Now to find him.

14:55.877 --> 14:56.877
(thunder crashing)

14:58.000 --> 15:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:05.387 --> 15:06.520
Hello, pretty bird.

15:09.591 --> 15:12.159
(screeching)

15:12.227 --> 15:13.594
(screams)

15:16.565 --> 15:19.433
Oh, stan, I hope
you don't get lost in there.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.002
What if you die? (gasps)

15:21.069 --> 15:23.571
I left my soda in the freezer.

15:24.773 --> 15:27.341
Francine! Let's do some shots!

15:27.409 --> 15:29.844
Klaus?!
What are you doing in here?

15:29.911 --> 15:31.612
Stan put me in here
two days ago.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.981
The only reason
I didn't freeze to death is

15:34.049 --> 15:36.684
I filled my bowl with
that bottle of vodka.

15:36.752 --> 15:38.452
Why'd he put you
in the freezer?

15:38.520 --> 15:40.721
Oh, I'll tell you why.
He... (vomits)

15:56.838 --> 15:58.272
Hey, chocodile,
watch where you're going.

15:59.508 --> 16:02.176
Oh, hell no. (roars)

16:03.312 --> 16:04.845
(grunting)

16:10.986 --> 16:12.186
(glass clanks)

16:17.159 --> 16:18.793
(air hisses)

16:19.394 --> 16:21.128
Buh-bye.

16:21.196 --> 16:22.930
(sighs)

16:22.998 --> 16:24.598
Francine:
You bastard!

16:24.666 --> 16:26.834
(gasps) francine?!

16:29.171 --> 16:31.639
Francine,
what are you...?

16:31.707 --> 16:33.207
Klaus told me you've
been poisoning roger

16:33.275 --> 16:35.643
Just because you don't want to
spend time alone with me!

16:35.711 --> 16:37.111
Um...

16:37.179 --> 16:39.947
Forget it, stan!
I'm gonna get roger out,

16:40.015 --> 16:41.682
And then when we get home,

16:41.750 --> 16:44.085
You can have
all the alone time you want

16:44.152 --> 16:46.220
Because I'm not gonna
be there!

16:46.288 --> 16:47.488
Francine, wait!

16:47.556 --> 16:49.757
It's dangerous in here.

16:52.427 --> 16:54.261
Francine!

16:57.499 --> 16:59.333
Francine!

17:07.876 --> 17:11.479
(anguished groaning)

17:11.546 --> 17:12.913
Who are you?

17:12.981 --> 17:15.549
(high-pitched, weak voice):
Roger's conscience.

17:15.617 --> 17:18.018
Oh, my god,
you're dying of neglect!

17:18.086 --> 17:22.021
Kill... Me!

17:22.089 --> 17:23.523
(groaning)

17:23.592 --> 17:24.592
Tom skerritt?!

17:24.659 --> 17:26.926
(weakly):
Get me work.

17:30.465 --> 17:34.034
Oh, my, is it time
to change already?

17:34.102 --> 17:38.205
Yep, time to peel outta
these old dungarees.

17:38.273 --> 17:39.306
Steve:
You boys ready

17:39.374 --> 17:41.675
For that swim test
today, or what?

17:46.948 --> 17:48.816
(boys yelling)

17:48.884 --> 17:51.852
Look at us, fellas!
The underwear works!

17:51.920 --> 17:53.154
Just like clyde
said it would!

17:53.221 --> 17:54.889
Put 'em in
the girls' cabin!

17:54.956 --> 17:56.257
They're so impressed,

17:56.324 --> 17:58.025
They're bringing us
straight to their women!

17:58.093 --> 17:59.059
(screams)

17:59.127 --> 18:00.261
(all scream)

18:00.328 --> 18:01.829
If only we
could thank

18:01.897 --> 18:04.565
That magical mystery
underwear salesman.

18:04.633 --> 18:07.268
Oh, I don't think we've seen
the last of him.

18:14.976 --> 18:16.043
(train whistle blows)

18:22.918 --> 18:24.718
(gasps) it's breathtaking.

18:28.156 --> 18:29.323
(birds chirping)

18:29.391 --> 18:31.292
The cherry blossoms,
the rolling hills,

18:31.359 --> 18:33.294
The three urkels grazing
in the meadow.

18:38.600 --> 18:41.035
(sign buzzing)

18:41.102 --> 18:42.303
Francine!

18:44.706 --> 18:46.674
No, no, I'll
never tell anyone.

18:46.741 --> 18:49.543
Your reputation is
safe with me.

18:51.079 --> 18:52.680
Hey, fellas, I nailed her!

18:52.747 --> 18:54.148
It was so easy!

18:54.216 --> 18:56.150
(creature bellows, sobs)

19:02.224 --> 19:05.759
I am vicki: Voice
input child identicant.

19:05.827 --> 19:06.861
What are tears?

19:06.928 --> 19:08.028
Next!

19:11.867 --> 19:13.367
(horn blares)

19:13.435 --> 19:15.069
Learn how to drive,
you bitch!

19:15.136 --> 19:18.205
Relax, mc raw g.
Let it go.

19:18.273 --> 19:21.075
Are you kidding?
Nobody cuts off
biggie smalls!

19:21.142 --> 19:22.309
(tires screeching)

19:22.377 --> 19:24.245
Hey, jackass, you want
some of this?!

19:24.312 --> 19:25.246
(gun hammer cocks)

19:25.313 --> 19:27.581
(gunshots)

19:27.649 --> 19:29.383
(tires squeal away)

19:33.255 --> 19:35.856
He said he made this for me.

19:35.924 --> 19:37.358
Stan:
No, you don't get it.

19:37.425 --> 19:40.561
Francine and I haven't been
alone together in 18 years.

19:40.629 --> 19:42.730
What if she thinks I'm boring
and leaves me?

19:44.165 --> 19:45.499
Is that true?

19:45.567 --> 19:48.969
Is that why you were afraid
to be alone with me?

19:49.037 --> 19:51.305
Because you thought
I'd be bored with you?

19:51.373 --> 19:53.307
(sheepishly):
Well, yeah.

19:53.375 --> 19:55.576
Stan, you might
not be interesting,

19:55.644 --> 19:57.711
But you're definitely
not boring.

19:57.779 --> 20:00.514
I mean, the kids
have only been gone
for two days,

20:00.582 --> 20:03.551
And look at us, we're inside
an alien's brain.

20:03.618 --> 20:05.986
So, you're not gonna
sit down to dinner

20:06.054 --> 20:08.455
And realize
you don't wanna be
with me anymore?

20:08.523 --> 20:10.691
No, honey.
I know who you are.

20:10.759 --> 20:12.426
And I love you.

20:12.494 --> 20:13.427
Both:
Mm...

20:13.495 --> 20:16.030
Come on.
Let's go get roger.

20:23.572 --> 20:26.407
No, francine.
He needs a prince.

20:30.178 --> 20:32.646
(frantic moaning)

20:32.714 --> 20:34.415
(spits)
what the hell are you doing?!

20:34.482 --> 20:36.684
Me? You're the one
making a move.

20:36.751 --> 20:38.519
I was just napping
on this pedestal

20:38.587 --> 20:40.888
In the perfect light in
my most prettiest dress.

20:40.956 --> 20:42.923
Roger, you're in a coma.

20:42.991 --> 20:45.926
We're in your brain
to help you wake up
and bring you home.

20:45.994 --> 20:47.194
Home?

20:47.262 --> 20:48.829
You mean... Your home?

20:48.897 --> 20:49.964
That's right.

20:50.031 --> 20:51.465
Oh, thank god!
I hated my apartment.

20:51.533 --> 20:54.301
I don't know if you noticed,
but it didn't have a bathroom.

20:54.369 --> 20:55.903
I won't be getting that security
deposit back.

20:58.139 --> 21:00.007
Hey, guess who I had
lunch with today.

21:00.075 --> 21:01.208
Tom skerritt.

21:01.276 --> 21:02.943
Oh, that's interesting.

21:03.011 --> 21:06.447
Oh, yeah.
I guess it is.

21:06.514 --> 21:08.549
Buh-bye!
