WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:03.504
<i>Previously on</i> East New York...

00:03.604 --> 00:04.772
We can significantly increase

00:04.872 --> 00:07.341
our coverage of the area
by having cops

00:07.441 --> 00:09.877
assigned to solo foot posts.

00:09.977 --> 00:11.412
Some sections
of the city have seen

00:11.512 --> 00:13.081
a marked downturn
in street crime.

00:13.181 --> 00:15.483
And one factor is the increase
in foot patrols.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.017
I was behind that 100%.

00:17.118 --> 00:19.487
<i>I've got an undercover--
Sean Dryden.</i>

00:19.587 --> 00:21.089
I'm not sure you should
be seen with me.

00:21.189 --> 00:23.857
Yeah, one of the reasons I want
out of undercover assignments.

00:23.957 --> 00:25.359
Sick of worrying
about things like that.

00:25.459 --> 00:26.527
I meant to call you last night.

00:26.627 --> 00:27.728
Yeah, it's-it's okay.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.097
I think
that we got hot and heavy

00:29.197 --> 00:30.464
a little too quick.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.032
I don't think it's
good for either one of us

00:32.133 --> 00:33.467
to be involved
right now.

00:33.567 --> 00:34.902
If it was me
that went off of my nut,

00:35.002 --> 00:37.938
Remy would've clipped me
without hesitation.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.540
Instead you did it to him!

00:39.640 --> 00:41.442
Yeah, I did it to him.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.611
You also have to answer
for killing Yolo Linden.

00:43.711 --> 00:44.712
<i>I'm sure you have</i>

00:44.812 --> 00:46.347
information on other dirty cops.

00:46.447 --> 00:47.681
Look, work with the D.A.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.217
Maybe they'll go
easy on you, Walsh.

00:49.317 --> 00:50.818
Regina.
Dad,

00:50.918 --> 00:52.653
I'm not going to talk shop
with you,

00:52.753 --> 00:54.255
unless you're ready
to tell me what

00:54.355 --> 00:55.456
went down with you at the 7-4.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.057

02:31.151 --> 02:32.920
I'm actually worried
you'll get bored of me

02:33.020 --> 02:35.022
if you don't have
to sneak around.

02:35.122 --> 02:37.425
Is that something
you're worried about?

02:37.525 --> 02:39.360
As long as I can

02:39.460 --> 02:42.430
turn and see you sleeping
next to me...

02:43.431 --> 02:45.333
I ain't worried
about nothing.

02:45.433 --> 02:48.236
Why don't we go away
for the weekend?

02:48.336 --> 02:50.204
Yeah,
where do you want to go?

02:50.304 --> 02:52.406
Just someplace pretty

02:52.506 --> 02:54.408
and away from here.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.377
I stayed at this place

02:56.477 --> 02:58.512
in the Berkshires
called Canyon Ranch

02:58.612 --> 03:00.248
on an undercover assignment.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.650
Super deluxe,
beautiful setting.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.485
That sounds great.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.654
I'll book it.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.956
Mmm.

03:09.056 --> 03:12.426
Girl, you better get out of here
before you got to call a 1013.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.762
Mmm.

03:16.997 --> 03:20.434
Yeah, that Booker Sons,
that's some serious barbecue.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.303
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, you ever have it?

03:22.403 --> 03:23.704
I never have.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.539
It's like
North Carolina barbecue.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.541
I think that's
where Booker was from.

03:27.641 --> 03:30.210
Rack of ribs,
brisket sandwich

03:30.311 --> 03:32.580
with a side of potato salad--
ooh, good God.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.315
Sound like you're
hungry, Marvin. Yeah.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.049
I ain't never been this close
without ordering something.

03:36.149 --> 03:38.085
Here.
You're damn right, I'm hungry.

03:38.185 --> 03:39.820
You want a granola bar?

03:39.920 --> 03:41.855
Man, get away
from me with that.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.257
Come on.

03:43.357 --> 03:44.925
Man, that's rabbit food.
This ain't no rabbit food.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.094
Put it in your back pocket...
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.733
All right, so you found Terrell
Booker Sr. around what time?

03:52.833 --> 03:54.868
Around 7:00 when I got in.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.437
When was the last time
you saw him alive?

03:56.537 --> 03:57.971
Last night
when we closed up.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.740
I mean,
it was about midnight.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.742
We'd tell him

04:01.842 --> 04:03.911
he didn't need to be
working this hard.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.647
You know, we'd tell him that
me and Javier could close up.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.149
Who's we, Mr. Booker?

04:09.249 --> 04:11.819
Uh, my mom and I.

04:11.919 --> 04:12.953
Boss?

04:13.053 --> 04:15.689
This is Terrell
Booker's wife.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.225
I'm so sorry for your loss.

04:18.326 --> 04:20.093
I told Terrell...

04:20.193 --> 04:23.063
not to close up by himself
late at night.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.798
I told him and told
him and told him.

04:24.898 --> 04:27.234
Hopefully my detectives will
be able to figure out exactly

04:27.335 --> 04:29.370
what it is
that happened.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.104
This, you recognize this?

04:31.204 --> 04:32.906
That's what Terrell
would put the deposits in.

04:33.006 --> 04:35.142
And Terrell would make
those bank deposits himself?

04:35.242 --> 04:38.111
Always.
Well, those deposits
are missing.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.881
Why don't you show me around?
Yeah.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.683
Uh.
This way.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.386
What time did you leave here
last night, Mr. Booker?

04:45.486 --> 04:46.854
Around 11:00.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.255
Who else was here at the time?

04:48.356 --> 04:49.890
Uh, my mother and father...

04:49.990 --> 04:53.761
Javier and a couple
of customers.

04:54.662 --> 04:55.729
But you close at 10:00.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.998
Yeah, my-my-my dad

04:58.098 --> 05:01.034
unlocked the door to let in
a few stragglers.

05:01.134 --> 05:04.237
We waited until
they finished.

05:04.338 --> 05:05.973
Maybe 10:30.

05:06.073 --> 05:08.108
Was your husband here
when you left?

05:08.208 --> 05:10.411
That's when he likes
to do the ordering

05:10.511 --> 05:12.846
and... pay the bills.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.148
He likes it then...

05:15.248 --> 05:16.984
because it's quiet.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.421
When was it that you saw
he hadn't come home?

05:20.521 --> 05:23.357
I was out like a light
when I got into bed.

05:23.457 --> 05:26.827
When I got up
around 7:00...
Mm-hmm.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.262
I saw that he hadn't come home.

05:29.363 --> 05:30.764
Oh, Chief.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.600
Mrs. Booker... Vivian.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.768
John.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.069
I'm so sorry.
I came as soon

05:36.169 --> 05:38.005
as I heard it on
the rad-- whoa, whoa.

05:39.407 --> 05:42.510
Uh, I've been coming here
since I was a patrolman.

05:42.610 --> 05:45.946
Can I please take her home and
let her rest for a little bit?

05:46.046 --> 05:47.748
Sure.
Come on, Ma.

05:48.916 --> 05:51.051
Terrell was so
afraid of falling.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.421
He used to say
that when you get

05:53.521 --> 05:55.355
to be a certain age,

05:55.456 --> 05:56.824
you got to stay upright.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.726
Because if you fall down
and break something,

05:58.826 --> 06:01.695
it's all downhill
from there.

06:01.795 --> 06:05.098
I never thought
he'd fall down and die.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.937
Now let's...
you can take her home.
Thank you, John.

06:10.738 --> 06:11.939
Thank you.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.074
Yeah.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.277
Wow.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.383
Oh, check this out.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.152
Yeah.

06:30.290 --> 06:32.493
Yo.
I had just been
made lieutenant.

06:32.593 --> 06:33.994
That's my moms,
my brother...

06:34.094 --> 06:36.564
You're in some good company
on this wall.

06:36.664 --> 06:38.231
Mayor Dinkins.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.967
That's Reggie Jackson.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.869
Dinkins, that's right.
Listen, I...

06:41.969 --> 06:44.371
I wanted to talk to you
about something. I-I...

06:44.472 --> 06:46.640
did this interview
for, uh...

06:46.740 --> 06:48.208
<i>All New York News.</i>

06:48.308 --> 06:50.611
Yeah. Hey, it was good.
Did you...? No, no.

06:50.711 --> 06:53.146
I'm not fishing.
Uh, I wanted to tell you...

06:53.246 --> 06:56.517
when the subject came up
about foot posts,

06:56.617 --> 06:59.252
I gave you all the credit,
and when...

06:59.352 --> 07:00.954
I saw the edited version,

07:01.054 --> 07:03.691
it sounded like I was
taking credit for myself.

07:03.791 --> 07:06.727
Chief, you don't owe
me no explanation...
No, I kind of feel like I do.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.564
Well, I-I appreciate
you giving me one.

07:10.664 --> 07:13.300
Okay?
Yeah, uh...

07:13.400 --> 07:15.603
so...

07:15.703 --> 07:17.771
how do we think
this whole thing happened?

07:17.871 --> 07:20.741
Well, from what we can tell,
it looks like

07:20.841 --> 07:22.776
some kind of blunt force trauma.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.479
Also, he didn't have
any cash on him

07:25.579 --> 07:27.347
and there was nothing
in the pouch that he used

07:27.447 --> 07:28.682
to make the deposits.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.218
So robbery is not out
of the question?

07:31.318 --> 07:32.352
Right, right.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.654
So...

07:33.754 --> 07:35.355
your gut tells you that it's not

07:35.455 --> 07:37.591
accidental?
My gut always tells me that.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.493
Start with murder

07:39.593 --> 07:42.429
unless shown to be otherwise.

08:02.516 --> 08:04.017
Popular restaurant.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.418
Uh-huh.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.755
I saw you got a big write-up
in <i>The New York Times.</i>

08:07.855 --> 08:09.389
Yeah, you'd think that'd
be a good thing, right?

08:09.489 --> 08:11.324
Good for business.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.061
Line out the door.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.896
Turn tables four,
five times a night.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.799
People taking pictures
of their food.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.333
Not what it's like
when I started.

08:20.433 --> 08:23.971
Hmm, I guess the increase
in popularity has its downside.

08:24.071 --> 08:26.239
I didn't mind the work.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.451
Gracias.

09:12.419 --> 09:14.154
Hey, how's it going?

09:22.395 --> 09:27.234
I've never known you to
drop by unannounced, Dad.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.169
Actually, I've never known
you to drop by at all.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.138
One thing about retirement is

09:31.238 --> 09:33.173
you get to do things
you've never done before.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.843
Yeah, hi, hi.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.478
Look at you,
Deputy Inspector.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.880
Big office.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.716
Windows, a conference table.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.317
It makes me proud.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.420
You didn't come by just
to tell me that, did you, Dad?

09:48.889 --> 09:50.658
I have a reason.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.126
What a surprise.

09:56.664 --> 09:58.732
You collared Kurt Walsh

09:58.832 --> 10:00.600
on the Remy Taylor homicide.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.402
Yes, we did.

10:02.502 --> 10:05.138
He's no doubt talking to
the D.A., trying to cut a deal.

10:05.238 --> 10:08.208
We knew that was
gonna happen.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.978
I have friends who are...

10:11.078 --> 10:12.612
concerned about
what he's saying.

10:12.713 --> 10:15.115
These are guys
you have known

10:15.215 --> 10:16.650
your whole life, Regina.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.452
What are they concerned about?

10:19.552 --> 10:21.188
What do you think, honey?

10:21.288 --> 10:23.924
No matter what,
Walsh is going away.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.794
If he thinks
he has half a shot

10:26.894 --> 10:29.196
at a few years
on the outside

10:29.296 --> 10:31.264
before he dies,
he'll say anything.

10:31.364 --> 10:33.701
So, what, they're
looking for a heads-up?

10:33.801 --> 10:36.203
They want to get out
in front of it.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.271
Do they have
to hire lawyers?

10:38.371 --> 10:40.207
Do they have
to find witnesses

10:40.307 --> 10:41.809
from God knows

10:41.909 --> 10:43.376
how many years ago?

10:44.377 --> 10:46.847
I'll see what I can find out.

10:48.916 --> 10:51.651
I said I would ask you,
and I did.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.386
Uh...

10:53.486 --> 10:55.588
how's everything
going with you

10:55.689 --> 10:57.691
and Mom?
Good.

10:58.558 --> 11:00.994
We watched a stupid movie
last night.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.130
You two are getting along,
in other words.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.665
We are. How about you?

11:05.766 --> 11:07.901
I get along with Mom fine.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.904
I meant, are you going out
with anyone?

11:11.772 --> 11:13.874
As a matter of fact...

11:13.974 --> 11:15.809
I am.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.845
Yeah.

11:17.945 --> 11:19.947
Care to provide any details?

11:20.047 --> 11:21.581
Nope.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.988
He is not a cop, is he?

11:28.822 --> 11:30.958
You play your cards

11:31.058 --> 11:33.160
close to the vest, Regina Gail.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.196
Who do you think I got it from?

11:38.899 --> 11:40.200
7-4, Sector David.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.701
Larceny of a package
at 1331 Flatlands Avenue.

11:41.802 --> 11:44.371
Complainant only speaks Italian,
very little English.

11:44.471 --> 11:47.174
Any officers out there
who speak Italian to respond?

11:47.274 --> 11:48.976
7-4, foot post 158.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.744
I speak Italian
and will respond.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.545
Well, I've been told
that my conversational Italian's

11:52.645 --> 11:54.347
getting pretty good.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.516
Are you saying you want to
head over there, Captain?

11:56.616 --> 11:58.085
Yes, Officer Gunst.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.620
That's exactly
what I'm saying.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.958
What's going on, Captain?
But, uh...

12:38.058 --> 12:39.292
<i>Officer Quinlan parla italiano.</i>

12:39.392 --> 12:41.161
Uh, <i>sì.</i>

12:41.261 --> 12:42.395
There's been another
package theft.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.064
That happens a
lot around here.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.565
Yeah, the job that came
in over the radio said

12:45.665 --> 12:47.901
that the package had been
stolen from her and...

12:48.001 --> 12:50.337
I have a feeling that she
doesn't speak very much English.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.839
Okay.

12:51.939 --> 12:54.574
<i>Ciao.
Ciao. Ciao.</i>

13:01.581 --> 13:02.582
Who's Mimi?

13:02.682 --> 13:04.717
<i>Chi è Mimi?</i>

13:04.818 --> 13:06.987
My dog.

13:07.087 --> 13:09.156
Very cute.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.438
Yeah.

13:25.538 --> 13:28.175
I guess you could
say I'm the <i>capo.</i>

13:28.275 --> 13:30.277
We're gonna do
all that's humanly possible

13:30.377 --> 13:33.113
to get your Mimi's ashes back.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.082
Starting with putting up

13:35.182 --> 13:38.051
a security camera
in case the robber comes back.

13:42.522 --> 13:45.158
You do this?

13:45.258 --> 13:46.927
Well, I don't actually do
the installation.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.795
But you do this?

13:48.896 --> 13:50.630
You make camera for me?

13:50.730 --> 13:52.099
Yeah.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.433
<i>Sì, sì.</i>

13:53.533 --> 13:56.203
Have TARU put, uh,
security cameras up.

13:56.303 --> 13:59.006
And we'll put a decoy box
on the front stoop.

13:59.106 --> 14:01.774
Okay.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.481
<i>Grazie.</i>

14:10.517 --> 14:13.320
So, what kind of relationship
do you have with Terrell Booker,

14:13.420 --> 14:15.822
Mr. Pappadopolis?
Uh, he's a tenant.

14:15.923 --> 14:17.224
He's a good tenant.

14:17.324 --> 14:19.459
We heard you had some kind
of dispute with him.

14:19.559 --> 14:22.662
Got pretty loud.
I'm Greek. Greeks talk loud.

14:22.762 --> 14:24.564
What was the nature
of the dispute?

14:24.664 --> 14:26.066
What's the nature
of these questions?

14:26.166 --> 14:28.301
We're detectives.

14:28.401 --> 14:29.736
I don't see how that entitles
you to make wide-ranging

14:29.836 --> 14:31.404
inquiries into how
I conduct my business.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.941
Terrell Booker was found dead
this morning.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.409
That's horrible.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.045
When was the last
time you saw him?

14:38.145 --> 14:40.013
I was over there yesterday.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.314
Was he current with the rent?

14:41.414 --> 14:44.484
Terrell was always current
with the rent.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.187
One of his sons, this Darnell,

14:47.287 --> 14:49.522
he wanted to open
a restaurant in Red Hook,

14:49.622 --> 14:51.424
came to me
for the up-front costs.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.260
I fronted him about $80,000.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.162
Now the restaurant's open,

14:55.262 --> 14:56.796
I'm expecting to get paid back.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.365
So you went to Terrell,

14:58.465 --> 15:00.367
thinking that he'd cover
his son's debt?

15:01.168 --> 15:04.071
Better than commencing
with eviction proceedings, no?

15:04.171 --> 15:07.007
I'm guessing Terrell didn't see
it as his responsibility?

15:07.107 --> 15:09.442
Not at first.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.979
We got into it pretty good,
but then I started

15:12.079 --> 15:14.081
talking about my sons,

15:14.181 --> 15:16.349
he started talking
about his sons.

15:16.449 --> 15:19.652
Before you know it,
we were both halfway to bawling.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.955
We came up with a number
we could both live with

15:22.055 --> 15:23.456
and went out for breakfast.

15:23.556 --> 15:26.193
I can show you the receipt,
you want to check.

15:26.293 --> 15:30.063
Yeah, I'm curious why you never
went to Darnell to make good

15:30.163 --> 15:31.164
on the back rent?

15:31.264 --> 15:32.665
I've seen Darnell get into it

15:32.765 --> 15:33.933
with customers,

15:34.034 --> 15:36.103
with his brother,

15:36.203 --> 15:37.904
and with his father.

15:38.005 --> 15:41.141
I avoid confrontations
that threaten to turn violent.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.443
With Darnell,

15:43.543 --> 15:45.445
you had to worry about that.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.889
Surprised to find you
at work today, Darnell.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.092
We'd have thought you would
have taken the day off.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.793
You would have thought wrong.

16:00.893 --> 16:02.695
I take it you and your father
weren't on the best of terms.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.332
I don't see as that's something
I got to answer to you for.

16:05.432 --> 16:06.633
Well, you kind of do, Darnell.

16:06.733 --> 16:07.967
How your father died
is something

16:08.068 --> 16:10.103
we take an interest in.

16:10.870 --> 16:13.473
He was alive and kicking
when I left him.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.142
And when was that?
Last night.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.677
What time?
I don't know what time.

16:22.282 --> 16:23.783
I think a precinct setting

16:23.883 --> 16:26.419
might be more conducive to
sharpening your sense of recall.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.455
Yeah, we're gonna need you
to come with us.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.890
Yo, I can't leave these guys
here alone. They ain't been

16:30.990 --> 16:32.559
working here but a few weeks.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.194
What's that you're burning
in there, Darnell?
Wood.

16:34.294 --> 16:35.528
100% wood.
Mm.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.330
You got a permit for that?

16:37.430 --> 16:38.931
Ain't nobody ever asked me
for a permit.

16:39.032 --> 16:41.034
Yeah, well, somebody's
asking you for one now.

16:41.134 --> 16:43.436
Close it up and let's go.

16:56.383 --> 16:57.750
Hey, Captain.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.386
The decoy box
look all right?

16:59.486 --> 17:00.920
Yeah.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.123
I rigged it so we could
figure out who the thief was.

17:03.923 --> 17:06.959
Oh, with those exploding
dye packs the banks use?

17:07.060 --> 17:10.330
Kinda. Kinda like that.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.633
She does that every day.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.203
You pass by her on your foot
post, you notice that, do you?

17:16.303 --> 17:17.970
Mm-hmm.

17:18.071 --> 17:19.906
Something about becoming aware

17:20.006 --> 17:21.541
of the lives of others,
isn't there?

17:21.641 --> 17:25.145
Wondering,
what do their days consist of?

17:26.746 --> 17:29.782
Well, I know one thing
that her day consists of today.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.684
She's wearing
a lot more makeup than usual.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.720
Well, you think that's
'cause she knows she's
gonna be on camera?

17:33.820 --> 17:37.157
I think it's 'cause she knows
that you were gonna be watching.

17:38.825 --> 17:41.861
Yeah, I can't imagine that
having anything to do with it.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.196
You know, Captain.

17:43.930 --> 17:46.065
Men can't imagine
a lot of things.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.668
<i>Okay, so set the scene
for us, Darnell.</i>

17:48.768 --> 17:53.173
You went over to your father's
restaurant for what reason?

17:53.273 --> 17:55.175
I missed a payment
to Pappadopolis.

17:55.275 --> 17:57.377
I wanted to see if my
father would cover me.

17:57.477 --> 17:58.745
And did he?

17:58.845 --> 18:00.513
No.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.048
Why not?

18:02.149 --> 18:04.484
Because he thought I was wrong
for going out on my own.

18:04.584 --> 18:07.487
But since I did, he said I had
to assume the risk myself.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.256
And why <i>did</i> you go off
on your own?

18:09.356 --> 18:12.091
I worked for my father from the
time I was 13 years old.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.627
I didn't want
to work for him anymore.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.596
But your brother stuck around?

18:16.696 --> 18:18.831
According to his LinkedIn page,

18:18.931 --> 18:20.600
your brother got
an MBA from Dartmouth.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.170
And he had all kinds of
big ideas he got from up there.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.837
Yeah. Like what?
Like putting the waitstaff

18:24.937 --> 18:28.475
in pre-stained aprons and
fake gold teeth as part of some

18:28.575 --> 18:30.710
private equity group's
marketing strategy.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.245
Hmm. I take it

18:32.345 --> 18:34.381
you didn't approve
of that marketing strategy?

18:34.481 --> 18:35.515
No, I didn't.

18:36.416 --> 18:39.386
He convinced my father to cut
the heart out of the business,

18:39.486 --> 18:42.655
make it into
some Black barbecue version of

18:42.755 --> 18:44.657
Middle American
family-friendly dining.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.461
You're gonna need to account

18:48.561 --> 18:51.130
for where you were last night, Darnell.

18:52.232 --> 18:56.068
I took a car to my parents'
restaurant around 8:00.

18:56.169 --> 18:58.471
Had a conversation
in the office with my father,

18:58.571 --> 18:59.939
and then I went home.

19:00.039 --> 19:01.541
What time was it
when you got home?

19:01.641 --> 19:03.510
I don't know.
What car service did you use?

19:03.610 --> 19:04.777
Whichever one
my girlfriend ordered.

19:04.877 --> 19:05.845
What's your girlfriend's name?

19:05.945 --> 19:06.846
Why? So you can browbeat her?

19:06.946 --> 19:07.947
So we can verify that what

19:08.047 --> 19:09.115
you're telling us is the truth.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.919
You're gonna have
to take my word for that.

19:13.019 --> 19:15.054
That's not how it works.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.090
What's your girlfriend's name?

19:20.092 --> 19:22.128
Nicole Pascale.

19:22.962 --> 19:25.932
And what's the name of the
private equity group, Darnell?

19:26.032 --> 19:28.268
Elkhart Hospitality.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.272
Did you ever meet
with them yourself?

19:33.105 --> 19:36.943
Yo, money don't mean
that much to me.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.358
Hey.

19:51.458 --> 19:54.427
I'm on my way to the borough.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.263
Where are you?

19:56.363 --> 19:58.130
What do you mean you're here?

20:05.972 --> 20:07.340
What are you doing here?

20:07.440 --> 20:09.509
I have entered a new
phase of my life.

20:09.609 --> 20:10.810
What does that mean?

20:10.910 --> 20:13.746
I got a transfer out
of Drug Enforcement and

20:13.846 --> 20:15.748
out of undercover work.

20:15.848 --> 20:18.351
You're kidding.
Mm-hmm.

20:18.451 --> 20:20.887
Yeah, I'm gonna be working
in the New York Field Office

20:20.987 --> 20:23.490
of the FBI from now on.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.292
Well...

20:25.392 --> 20:27.327
you didn't tell me
you were even trying for that.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.095
I didn't want to tell you
until it was a done deal.

20:29.195 --> 20:32.699
So no more sneaking around.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.334
Uh-uh. No.

20:35.134 --> 20:37.270
That's actually
really great news.

20:37.370 --> 20:38.738
Mm.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.407
Can I kiss you?

20:40.507 --> 20:41.941
No... you can't.
Okay.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.543
Not here.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.678
Okay.
Okay.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.298
Hey, come in.

21:06.232 --> 21:08.901
So, I know that you have
a personal relationship

21:09.001 --> 21:10.737
with the Booker family,

21:10.837 --> 21:13.840
which is why I wanted
to let you know that

21:13.940 --> 21:16.008
Crime Scene determined

21:16.108 --> 21:17.910
that there was
no forcible entry,

21:18.010 --> 21:21.013
making robbery highly unlikely.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.350
Thanks for letting me know.

21:24.216 --> 21:26.619
Also, I wanted to ask.

21:26.719 --> 21:29.288
Do you know anything
about the status

21:29.389 --> 21:31.023
of the Kurt Walsh prosecution?

21:31.123 --> 21:34.527
I think it's still
in front of the grand jury. Okay.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.663
Thanks.

21:36.763 --> 21:38.297
Who wants to know, Regina?

21:38.398 --> 21:40.132
Hey, just
a couple old-timers

21:40.232 --> 21:42.134
wondering what's coming down
the pike. You know how it is.

21:42.234 --> 21:43.736
I'll see what I can find out.

21:43.836 --> 21:46.072
Okay. Thanks.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.843
<i>I don't understand why</i>

21:50.943 --> 21:52.845
<i>you brought him here
in the first place.</i>

21:52.945 --> 21:55.314
We typically conduct
interviews at the precinct.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.116
He wasn't a witness,

21:57.216 --> 21:59.218
and I sure as hell hope
he's not a suspect.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.320
He is a grieving
family member,

22:01.421 --> 22:03.356
so why were you
conducting an interview?

22:03.456 --> 22:05.024
We're trying to piece together

22:05.124 --> 22:07.126
how your husband died,
Mrs. Booker.

22:08.094 --> 22:10.096
He's free to go.

22:10.196 --> 22:11.898
Why he wasn't free to go
before this?

22:11.998 --> 22:13.332
We had to verify
what he told us.

22:13.433 --> 22:15.568
What could you have possibly
said this time?

22:15.668 --> 22:19.572
You know what, Ma? You better
get him out of my face.

22:20.373 --> 22:22.642
Chief Suarez
will hear about this.

22:26.212 --> 22:28.448
Is this gonna be made public

22:28.548 --> 22:30.316
that there's a whole
investigation going on?

22:30.417 --> 22:31.684
Is that something
you're concerned about?

22:31.784 --> 22:33.085
Only because

22:33.185 --> 22:34.654
we've been negotiating
with this company

22:34.754 --> 22:36.322
who wants to open
a Booker Sons in Vegas,

22:36.423 --> 22:39.626
and, well, negotiations are
at a delicate point.

22:39.726 --> 22:41.694
I'd hate to see something like
this get out and spook them.

22:41.794 --> 22:44.897
That's exciting--
opening a place in Vegas.

22:44.997 --> 22:47.534
My father started this business
with next to nothing.

22:47.634 --> 22:49.235
When I told him

22:49.335 --> 22:51.638
that we were gonna take it
national, his face lit up.

22:51.738 --> 22:54.273
But suddenly he backed out
and wouldn't tell me why.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.208
It was really weird.

22:58.244 --> 23:00.680
Thank you.

23:17.864 --> 23:20.667
<i>Well, we know
that Terrell Booker and his son</i>

23:20.767 --> 23:22.935
were in the process of working
out a deal with your company.

23:23.035 --> 23:25.472
We were well along in the
process, at which point

23:25.572 --> 23:28.274
Mr. Booker decided
to pull up stakes.

23:28.374 --> 23:29.609
He say why?

23:29.709 --> 23:31.143
Offered no explanation whatsoever.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.946
It seemed to baffle his son
as much as it did us.

23:34.046 --> 23:37.183
In fact, the day his father
pulled out, he called,

23:37.283 --> 23:40.219
assuring me that he could
get his dad back on board.

23:40.319 --> 23:41.888
The other son ever
get involved?

23:41.988 --> 23:43.990
I never met the other son.

23:44.757 --> 23:48.861
Well, you know, you're using
the name Booker Sons, plural.

23:48.961 --> 23:51.764
Um, wouldn't both sons expect
to be part of it?

23:51.864 --> 23:54.501
I think of myself
as a storyteller.

23:54.601 --> 23:56.936
Ah. I thought
you run restaurant chains.

23:57.036 --> 23:58.538
Restaurant chains <i>are</i>
about a story.

23:58.638 --> 24:00.907
The Italian restaurant
at Woodbridge Mall?

24:01.007 --> 24:03.576
Was that a real Italian
restaurant? Of course not.

24:03.676 --> 24:06.112
It's pretending to be
an Italian restaurant.

24:06.212 --> 24:07.747
It's telling a story.

24:07.847 --> 24:09.215
But Terrell Booker
is a real barbecue guy

24:09.315 --> 24:11.484
and ran a real
barbecue restaurant.

24:11.584 --> 24:12.819
And what we intend to do is

24:12.919 --> 24:15.387
ever so slightly enhance
that reality.

24:15.488 --> 24:17.456
So, we researched
Terrell's family tree.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.492
We tell an origin story.

24:19.592 --> 24:22.729
You mean of when Terrell Sr.
opened the place?

24:22.829 --> 24:23.996
Go back further.

24:24.096 --> 24:25.464
To when he was born?

24:25.565 --> 24:27.834
To sharecroppers
in the Deep South.

24:27.934 --> 24:31.938
To ribs and pig trotters
served on wax paper.

24:32.038 --> 24:33.339
It may not be my story

24:33.439 --> 24:35.241
or your story, but

24:35.341 --> 24:37.476
it's somebody's story, and we're
gonna tell the hell out of it.

24:37.577 --> 24:39.912
Would it be possible
to take a look

24:40.012 --> 24:42.849
at whatever paperwork's related
to your negotiation

24:42.949 --> 24:45.317
with the Booker family?
Of course. You know,

24:45.417 --> 24:46.786
Terrell Jr. was very upset

24:46.886 --> 24:48.621
about his father pulling out
of the deal.

24:48.721 --> 24:50.690
Have you spoken to him?

24:51.924 --> 24:54.293
Wow. Terrell Jr.
clearly spent a lot of money

24:54.393 --> 24:55.828
on this expansion idea.

24:55.928 --> 24:57.597
Since they're calling it
Booker Sons,

24:57.697 --> 25:00.032
shouldn't there be a waiver
from the other son?

25:00.132 --> 25:02.969
"Artists to be featured
on Booker Sons playlist--

25:03.069 --> 25:05.972
"Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters,
Howlin' Wolf,

25:06.072 --> 25:07.907
Elmore James..."
Hmm.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.509
Isn't a waiver something
a lawyer would insist on?

25:10.610 --> 25:13.512
"Decor to feature
incidental photographs

25:13.613 --> 25:16.082
"of Black blues musicians, preferably

25:16.182 --> 25:18.250
"taken by Black photographers.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.820
"A genealogical Booker family
tree artistically rendered

25:20.920 --> 25:23.790
is to be prominently
displayed."

25:29.596 --> 25:31.497
They ran DNA tests.

25:31.598 --> 25:33.800
Anything interesting?

25:37.937 --> 25:42.108
Ah. Probably not the results
they were expecting.

25:47.179 --> 25:49.682
You got anything
on that security cam, Captain?

25:49.782 --> 25:52.351
Same individual has walked past
Juliana's house

25:52.451 --> 25:54.153
twice now.

25:54.253 --> 25:55.822
Marvin, you guys ready?

25:55.922 --> 25:58.625
We're ready, boss.
You got something?

25:59.458 --> 26:01.894
Bingo. Sector David.

26:01.994 --> 26:04.363
<i>We've got a suspicious male,
curly hair,</i>

26:04.463 --> 26:06.398
in a camouflage jacket,

26:06.498 --> 26:08.334
<i>on Flatlands and Ashford,</i>

26:08.434 --> 26:09.702
driving a gray sedan.

26:09.802 --> 26:11.070
<i>Bentley and Sandeford, intercept.</i>

26:11.170 --> 26:12.404
<i>We're on it, Captain.</i>

26:15.975 --> 26:17.543
Police. Don't move.

26:18.177 --> 26:19.545
Don't do it.

26:20.346 --> 26:21.848
Don't do it.

26:21.948 --> 26:22.882
LAPD!

26:22.982 --> 26:24.483
Stop! Police!

26:30.657 --> 26:31.624
Ooh.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.275
Stop moving.

26:50.643 --> 26:52.979
Stupid glitter bomb.
Give me your hand.

26:53.079 --> 26:54.847
You thought you was faster
than me? Little did you know,

26:54.947 --> 26:58.985
state championship,
2017, baby.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.324
All right.

27:05.424 --> 27:07.694
This should do it.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.165
Where'd you pick up
this trick?

27:13.265 --> 27:16.368
Uh, years of sneaking off
to clubs in the city,

27:16.468 --> 27:19.038
you learn how
to get glitter off.

27:19.906 --> 27:22.041
How's your mom doing?

27:22.141 --> 27:24.043
She's good.

27:24.143 --> 27:27.479
Um, her and Duke--
they're in St. Bart's

27:27.579 --> 27:29.849
until the weather turns warm, so...

27:29.949 --> 27:32.184
I wouldn't mind
being in St. Bart's

27:32.284 --> 27:33.519
till the weather gets warm.

27:33.619 --> 27:36.055
Yeah, me neither.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.324
You really have it all over.

27:38.424 --> 27:40.793
I know.

27:53.973 --> 27:55.742
So, you work this
neighborhood, huh, Gustavo?

27:55.842 --> 27:58.310
I was just riding around, man.
Riding around.

27:58.410 --> 27:59.846
And you just decided
to steal a package

27:59.946 --> 28:01.714
off somebody's stoop
for fun? Is that it?

28:01.814 --> 28:03.750
I was bringing it back.
Okay? I found it.

28:03.850 --> 28:05.551
I assume you think
this is a minor infraction,

28:05.651 --> 28:06.886
like jaywalking or spitting

28:06.986 --> 28:08.420
on the sidewalk, huh?
It's not?

28:08.520 --> 28:11.791
No. No, no, no. You committed
criminal trespass, larceny.

28:11.891 --> 28:14.426
And if you broke the plane of
the front portico, well, then,

28:14.526 --> 28:16.062
we're talking
aggravated burglary, as well.

28:16.162 --> 28:18.030
I don't know
what all that means.
It means

28:18.130 --> 28:20.599
three to five years in prison,
and you too pretty for that.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.135
I just picked up a box.
I didn't even know it belonged

28:23.235 --> 28:25.171
to anybody.
It was sitting
on someone's stoop, fool.

28:25.271 --> 28:26.505
It was sitting on a front stoop.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.441
What were you gonna do
with it, Gustavo?

28:29.541 --> 28:30.810
Nothing.

28:34.580 --> 28:36.015
I stash 'em and

28:36.115 --> 28:38.250
I sell what's inside.
Where do you stash 'em?

28:38.350 --> 28:42.121
What happens if I tell you?
You get to finish high school.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.127
We appreciate you coming in.

28:48.227 --> 28:49.862
We, uh...

28:49.962 --> 28:54.600
we know there were some...
disagreements in your family.

28:55.667 --> 28:58.004
And there's nothing
unusual with that.

28:58.104 --> 29:00.006
Terrell, you and your
father were interested

29:00.106 --> 29:02.408
in franchising your
barbecue restaurant

29:02.508 --> 29:04.210
and were about
to make a deal

29:04.310 --> 29:08.214
with a private equity
group to finance that.
That's right.

29:08.314 --> 29:10.950
But your father pulled out
at the very last minute, right?

29:11.050 --> 29:12.651
Yeah, I suspect my brother

29:12.751 --> 29:14.453
convinced him
to do that.

29:14.553 --> 29:16.655
I wish I <i>could</i>
claim credit for it.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.190
Okay.

29:18.991 --> 29:22.561
As part of their marketing
strategy, this...

29:22.661 --> 29:25.331
private equity group
had you take a DNA test

29:25.431 --> 29:27.633
to trace your ancestry
to the sharecroppers

29:27.733 --> 29:29.035
in the Mississippi Delta.

29:29.135 --> 29:31.070
Yet another way
to culturally appropriate

29:31.170 --> 29:33.172
the Black experience and
turn it into a sales gimmick.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.942
Also known as giving Black
people a seat at the table,

29:36.042 --> 29:37.643
which my brother chooses
not to acknowledge.

29:37.743 --> 29:38.945
God knows I can't convince him,

29:39.045 --> 29:40.947
which is why we go
our separate ways.

29:44.650 --> 29:47.386
What were the results
of that DNA test, do you know?

29:47.486 --> 29:50.589
Yeah. Our family was originally
from Nigeria.

29:51.690 --> 29:54.226
How did you get the results?

29:54.326 --> 29:55.828
My mother.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.899
So, the report showed more

29:59.999 --> 30:03.235
than that your family was
from Nigeria, Terrell.

30:03.335 --> 30:06.705
What did it show exactly?

30:07.506 --> 30:11.844
Test showed that your biological
father was Wesley Mayfield,

30:11.944 --> 30:14.213
not Terrell Booker.

30:15.547 --> 30:18.050
That's...

30:18.150 --> 30:19.451
that's not true.

30:19.551 --> 30:20.953
No, Darnell, it is.

30:21.053 --> 30:23.255
It is.

30:23.355 --> 30:25.191
Wait. What?

30:25.291 --> 30:28.194
You're, you're saying
the... the man

30:28.294 --> 30:29.528
that raised me,

30:29.628 --> 30:31.563
the man that I'm named after...

30:31.663 --> 30:34.066
wasn't my father?

30:37.003 --> 30:38.938
That's what the test
showed, son.

30:41.807 --> 30:44.911
Who's Wesley Mayfield?
Well, who is that?

30:45.644 --> 30:50.249
Wesley Mayfield was convicted
of murder in 2005,

30:50.349 --> 30:51.918
and he was stabbed

30:52.018 --> 30:53.385
in the prison yard
at Sing Sing

30:53.485 --> 30:56.122
in 2018.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.294
No.

31:02.394 --> 31:04.230
No. No.

31:04.330 --> 31:06.232
I don't know who that is.
That's not my dad.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.400
I don't know what that is.
I don't know who that is.

31:08.500 --> 31:09.701
That's not my dad.

31:09.801 --> 31:11.237
Hey, bro...

31:11.337 --> 31:12.538
Shut your mouth, Darnell.

31:12.638 --> 31:13.872
I'm serious, bro.

31:13.973 --> 31:15.607
Darnell, get away...
Don't-don't touch me,

31:15.707 --> 31:17.043
Darnell!

31:17.143 --> 31:18.978
I'm serious, bro.
Who is that guy?
Look.

31:19.078 --> 31:20.579
That don't mean nothing.
Who is that?

31:20.679 --> 31:22.081
You're my brother.
Who is that?

31:22.181 --> 31:23.849
Bro, stop.
It don't matter.
You're my blood.

31:23.950 --> 31:25.617
Bro, stop!
Brother, you're my blood.

31:25.717 --> 31:27.819
Darnell!
Look! It does not matter.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.956
Bro, she lied.

31:30.056 --> 31:31.723
You're still my brother.

31:31.823 --> 31:33.192
You're good!

31:33.292 --> 31:35.827
Bro, don't mean nothing.

31:35.928 --> 31:38.297
I don't know who
that guy is, bro.

31:38.397 --> 31:39.765
Don't mean nothing, bro.

31:39.865 --> 31:41.333
Who the hell is
that guy, bro?

31:41.433 --> 31:44.303
I don't even know
who that guy is, bro.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.338
She wanted to keep
her family together.

31:46.438 --> 31:50.709
We need to find out
what her husband wanted.

31:50.809 --> 31:53.245
I love you, man.

31:53.345 --> 31:54.413
I'm sorry.

32:03.789 --> 32:05.624
Oh, my gosh!

32:05.724 --> 32:07.559
Is this thing organized at all?

32:08.760 --> 32:10.997
What you mean,
"organized"?
I mean,

32:11.097 --> 32:12.698
do you designate
which boxes were stolen

32:12.798 --> 32:14.366
from which block?
Nah, nah.

32:14.466 --> 32:16.735
I just keep 'em in here until
I can open them up and sell 'em.

32:16.835 --> 32:19.338
Maybe you could
organize them by what date

32:19.438 --> 32:21.207
they were stolen.
Oh, I'm just

32:21.307 --> 32:23.509
taking a guess here, but,
uh, I don't think this guy's

32:23.609 --> 32:26.045
too well organized, boss.
I got it.

32:26.145 --> 32:27.579
Mimi's ashes.

32:27.679 --> 32:29.115
Fantastic. All right.

32:29.215 --> 32:30.983
Coordinate with
the property clerk

32:31.083 --> 32:33.019
to determine where
they want the rest of them.

32:33.119 --> 32:34.920
I will take the precious Mimi

32:35.021 --> 32:37.223
to the designated
addressee myself.

32:37.323 --> 32:38.624
Take him to booking.

32:38.724 --> 32:41.160
You got it. Let's go,
Sticky Fingers.

32:43.929 --> 32:45.631
Viv?

32:46.999 --> 32:48.934
You all right with it
on the hot side?

32:49.035 --> 32:50.469
Sure.

32:50.569 --> 32:52.371
You, I know about.

32:55.541 --> 32:58.844
Vivian, we found out about

32:58.944 --> 33:00.546
the DNA test results.

33:01.347 --> 33:04.216
Oh, I don't pay that no mind.

33:04.316 --> 33:07.519
We know your husband
wasn't your eldest son's

33:07.619 --> 33:09.355
father.

33:09.455 --> 33:11.423
He and I raised Terrell Jr.

33:11.523 --> 33:14.660
Terrell Jr. loved him
like a father, and he loved

33:14.760 --> 33:16.262
Terrell Jr. like a son,

33:16.362 --> 33:19.498
so in what sense was he not
Terrell Jr.'s real father?

33:19.598 --> 33:22.768
In the sense that they weren't
biologically related.

33:23.769 --> 33:25.171
That don't matter to me.

33:25.271 --> 33:27.806
Did it matter to your husband?

33:31.009 --> 33:33.379
My husband...

33:33.479 --> 33:37.149
couldn't get it out of his head.

33:37.249 --> 33:39.751
He started pulling out calendars

33:39.851 --> 33:41.087
and dates.

33:41.187 --> 33:42.421
What dates?

33:42.521 --> 33:43.822
When it was

33:43.922 --> 33:45.157
he and I were together

33:45.257 --> 33:49.027
as of when Terrell Jr.
was born.

33:49.128 --> 33:50.562
Could have

33:50.662 --> 33:53.599
I had relations
with Wesley <i>after</i> the date

33:53.699 --> 33:56.968
on which Terrell
and I were together?

33:57.069 --> 33:59.138
Terrell's 28 years old.

33:59.238 --> 34:02.341
Did Terrell Sr. want
to tell your son

34:02.441 --> 34:06.378
that he was not his father?

34:07.813 --> 34:11.083
Why would you put that kind
of hurt on somebody

34:11.183 --> 34:14.486
that didn't do nothing
to deserve it?

34:15.321 --> 34:18.757
You weren't gonna let him,
were you?

34:20.726 --> 34:22.594
I didn't offer you nothing
to drink.

34:22.694 --> 34:26.365
What do you want, honey?
You want some sweet tea?

34:26.465 --> 34:27.799
'Cause once he put his mind
to something,

34:27.899 --> 34:30.136
there was probably
no talking him out of it.

34:32.971 --> 34:35.107
Viv?

34:42.481 --> 34:44.883
I stood in front of him.

34:47.153 --> 34:50.389
He tried
to push me out of the way,

34:50.489 --> 34:53.359
but I wouldn't be pushed
out the way.

34:53.459 --> 34:55.294
He said
some horrible things.

34:55.394 --> 34:57.263
I slapped his face,

34:57.363 --> 35:00.699
and he slapped my face.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.568
And all that stood

35:02.668 --> 35:05.504
between him
and my son being hurt

35:05.604 --> 35:07.606
was me.

35:08.507 --> 35:11.310
We were at the top
of the stairs.

35:13.879 --> 35:17.183
I pushed him,

35:17.283 --> 35:19.518
and he fell.

How you find?
Well, we used
every resource available,

36:37.363 --> 36:39.831
which was considerable,
and, uh,

36:39.931 --> 36:43.134
as I say, it's...
it's been a problem, and...

36:43.235 --> 36:45.271
uh...

36:46.071 --> 36:47.339
We got lucky.

36:47.439 --> 36:49.541
I make you something.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.777
Oh, no. No, no, no,
you-you don't have to.

36:51.877 --> 36:54.280
I want to.

37:10.429 --> 37:12.331
<i>You ever eat there?</i>

37:12.431 --> 37:13.865
Being that I'm a vegetarian,

37:13.965 --> 37:16.635
I don't generally
frequent barbecue places.

37:16.735 --> 37:19.971
Oh. I forgot. Keep forgetting.

37:20.071 --> 37:22.641
It's a shame
about the family, though.
All these good things

37:22.741 --> 37:24.976
happening for them,
and none of it matters.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.778
I'd be surprised if

37:26.878 --> 37:28.747
either of the brothers
open for business

37:28.847 --> 37:30.416
any time soon.
Speaking of which,

37:30.516 --> 37:32.017
any ideas
what you want to eat tonight?

37:32.117 --> 37:33.485
Ooh, I'd love to get a rib eye

37:33.585 --> 37:35.153
at Gage Tollner, but I doubt

37:35.253 --> 37:36.221
we could get in.

37:36.322 --> 37:38.123
Let's, um...
We can get in.

37:38.223 --> 37:40.992
But wait.

37:41.092 --> 37:44.330
Is there something there for
you that's not meat, or...?

37:44.430 --> 37:46.432
Other than you? Mmm.

37:46.532 --> 37:49.200
They have great sides, mama.
We good.

37:49.301 --> 37:51.202
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

37:51.303 --> 37:54.406
Oh. And dessert?

37:54.506 --> 37:55.907
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

37:56.007 --> 37:58.610
Come on, let's go. Let's go.
I'm not mad at that.

37:59.411 --> 38:00.946
Now, you know
I don't eat sweets,

38:01.046 --> 38:02.548
but I do have a sweet tooth.
Uh-huh.

38:02.648 --> 38:04.249
Shh.
Mmm-mmm.

38:05.584 --> 38:07.819
I didn't say anything.
Hey, Chief.

38:07.919 --> 38:09.187
Regina.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.722
Everything all right?

38:10.822 --> 38:14.092
Yeah. Uh, I just want
to talk to you for a minute.

38:14.192 --> 38:16.695
Uh, should we go to my office?

38:16.795 --> 38:19.898
Okay. Oh.

38:19.998 --> 38:21.833
Sean Dryden, Chief Suarez.

38:21.933 --> 38:22.601
All right.

38:22.701 --> 38:24.970
I'll be right back.

38:26.705 --> 38:28.607
<i>Vivian Booker gave my detectives</i>

38:28.707 --> 38:31.076
a pretty airtight statement.

38:31.176 --> 38:33.278
Mm-hmm.

38:33.379 --> 38:35.647
Yeah, she'll plead
to manslaughter.

38:35.747 --> 38:39.851
Well, with a sympathetic judge,
she'll probably do 18 months.

38:42.087 --> 38:43.922
Between her two sons
and what she's gonna be

38:44.022 --> 38:48.527
carrying around inside,
she's doing life.

38:51.697 --> 38:53.965
I, uh, got the feeling

38:54.065 --> 38:56.802
there's something
you want to tell me.

39:00.238 --> 39:03.108
No surprise that Walsh is
singing for his supper.

39:07.813 --> 39:12.250
The 7-4 had a lot of dirty
cops back in the day, Regina.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.653
So Walsh is just
reeling off their names.

39:14.753 --> 39:17.322
I imagine
the statute of limitations

39:17.423 --> 39:18.457
has run on most of it.

39:18.557 --> 39:20.392
Not on homicide.

39:21.927 --> 39:23.962
Right.

39:24.763 --> 39:26.498
Apparently,
they're getting close

39:26.598 --> 39:28.634
to coming out with indictments

39:28.734 --> 39:30.402
around the death
of Yolo Linden.

39:30.502 --> 39:31.837
Well, you said yourself,

39:31.937 --> 39:33.505
somebody has to answer
for his killing.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.206
A bunch of somebodies.

39:35.306 --> 39:38.076
I just never figured that...

39:38.176 --> 39:40.912
one of them
would be your father.

39:43.482 --> 39:44.916
What?

39:46.618 --> 39:48.386
Um, nice to meet you.

39:48.487 --> 39:50.155
Nice meeting you, Chief.

39:54.292 --> 39:56.462
What's the cancelation policy

39:56.562 --> 39:59.431
on that place
you booked for the weekend?

39:59.531 --> 40:01.533
You all right?

40:05.837 --> 40:07.539
Fine.
