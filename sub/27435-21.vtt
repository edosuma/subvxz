You want to be informed?

11:00.760 --> 11:02.648
Fine. I'll inform you.

against this country.

looking for the Grimms

looking for them, too.

for this.

Unless we get the drive first.

without it.

it is you're planning.

is to shut you down.

with Scottie tonight

11:55.540 --> 11:58.703
and figure out
a transition plan
for me to bring Agnes home.

11:58.750 --> 12:00.638
The only reason
I'm not with her
is because I thought

12:00.680 --> 12:03.217
figuring out
who you really were
would put her in harm's way.

12:03.250 --> 12:04.888
Now I know it won't,

12:04.920 --> 12:07.912
but in trying to find out
if you were the devil,

12:07.960 --> 12:09.951
I learned my mother was.

12:09.990 --> 12:12.379
That tape they played
at your trial?

12:13.430 --> 12:16.888
She destroyed my father.
She's the reason he ran.

12:16.930 --> 12:19.990
I shot him, but she's
responsible for his death.

Your mother
can't hurt you.

The Russians don't seem
to think so.

When Ressler was trying to
help me find out who you were,

12:29.510 --> 12:32.570
he went looking for her
and was confronted by the KGB

12:32.610 --> 12:34.840
about what he found out.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.041
What ifI bring Agnes back,
and they're right,

12:37.090 --> 12:39.342
and she's alive
and she finds us?

I want an apology.

I already apologized.

No.

that doesn't happen?

consider a change of plans.

The situation is untenable.

She does, and if she thinks
that's what Keen and Ressler

she'll come with force.

we could never trust you.

33:31.670 --> 33:33.558
As you know,
in September this year,

33:33.610 --> 33:36.636
the _BND contracted
my private security firm

33:36.680 --> 33:38.545
for an intelligence-gathering

33:39.350 --> 33:40.408
It was during that op

to be led by Anna McMahon,

34:04.210 --> 34:07.008
a high-ranking official
in the Justice Department.

34:07.040 --> 34:09.702
I believe McMahon,
along with select others,

are working in concert

34:11.710 --> 34:14.372
with members
of the President's

is in on this.

why this is happening

but I do know
the when and where.

does it fit in now?

how to prevent

supposedly wants
this to happen,

35:42.000 --> 35:44.468
we can't inform him

or not.

Which is why
we can't call it off.

36:10.460 --> 36:12.269
If we do, they'll arrest us
and we'll hang for treason.

36:12.300 --> 36:14.063
We are gonna hang
for treason.

36:14.100 --> 36:15.738
Not if someone else
takes the blame.

36:16.940 --> 36:18.259
The Third Estate
can't save us now.

36:18.310 --> 36:20.528
No. Only Reddington can.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.034

And take him down
once and for all.

that we lost the dossier,

and the walls are closing in,

as a martyr to the cause.
