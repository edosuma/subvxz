20:38.887 --> 20:40.404
 and FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY

20:40.406 --> 20:41.981
 and TOYOTA.

20:41.983 --> 20:44.325
Captioned by
 Media Access Group at WGBH
access.wgbh.org

20:48.915 --> 20:50.897
So, I was doing a panel at CPAC,

20:50.899 --> 20:52.808
the Clone Political
Action Committee.

20:52.810 --> 20:53.993
Not the other one, they suck.

20:53.995 --> 20:56.254
And I saw
the tallest drink of water

20:56.256 --> 20:57.980
I'd ever seen in my life.

20:57.982 --> 20:59.164
(chuckles)

20:59.166 --> 21:00.833
I looked at him and said,
"There's a man

21:00.835 --> 21:02.318
I'd like to share a bed with."

21:02.320 --> 21:05.170
That was a thing
in my day. It was!

21:05.172 --> 21:07.265
Then I found out
he was an actor

21:07.267 --> 21:09.325
and, uh, boy,
that was a red flag.

21:09.327 --> 21:12.085
Well, yes, but now
we've been running mates

21:12.087 --> 21:13.771
for four straight terms.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.164
Didn't hurt that
we were running

21:15.166 --> 21:17.666
against Jimmy Carter
and Grover Cleveland.

21:17.668 --> 21:19.502
(laughter)

21:19.504 --> 21:20.927
Oh, we'll be back.

21:20.929 --> 21:23.764
Between my malaise
and his mugwumps, we can't lose.

21:23.766 --> 21:25.491
(laughter)

21:28.362 --> 21:29.453
Shh!
