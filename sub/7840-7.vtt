00:27.951 --> 00:28.410
Ah.

00:31.339 --> 00:32.769
Bart, what are you doing?

00:32.770 --> 00:34.151
I only eat the clown heads.

00:34.235 --> 00:35.977
That's so wasteful.

00:36.008 --> 00:36.837
I've always done it.

00:36.838 --> 00:38.994
Just like I only eat the eyes off a lobster.

00:39.062 --> 00:40.021
MMMMhhhh......

00:40.460 --> 00:42.278
Oh, you should be ashamed!

00:42.287 --> 00:45.640
Your father works very hard to put lobsters on our table.

00:45.692 --> 00:47.871
Every night, he comes home exhausted,

00:47.922 --> 00:49.924
with his voice too hoarse to talk.

00:56.169 --> 00:58.170
I'm the king of goofing off!

01:02.109 --> 01:03.953
Ow! Unnecessary roughness!

01:03.957 --> 01:04.772
So what?

01:04.796 --> 01:06.333
That's legal in Rolo-Polo.

01:06.338 --> 01:08.401
I thought we were playing Cincinnati Time Waste.

01:08.766 --> 01:10.633
Oh, in that case...

01:12.427 --> 01:13.612
What did I do?

01:13.668 --> 01:14.890
When you pass the coffee machine,

01:14.895 --> 01:17.052
you're supposed to yell "hot pot" and eat a sugar cube.

01:17.085 --> 01:18.933
He's right, Homer. That's a two-minute penalty.

01:20.077 --> 01:21.273
Penalty, penalty, penalty!

01:21.275 --> 01:23.740
Penalty, penalty, penalty...

01:26.887 --> 01:27.680
On your feet,

01:27.685 --> 01:30.410
you sniggering oran-gu-tan.

01:36.616 --> 01:38.013
My fat friend,

01:38.047 --> 01:41.133
you are hanging by a very thin thread.

01:43.125 --> 01:45.890
If you want to keep your job, then you better start...

01:50.666 --> 01:51.500
You're thinking about

01:51.508 --> 01:53.141
that ice cream truck, aren't you?

01:53.308 --> 01:55.193
Well, you can just forget about...

01:55.668 --> 01:58.271
Come and lick me, big boy.

01:58.275 --> 02:00.942
I said lick me!

02:03.766 --> 02:04.222
Ew!

02:04.758 --> 02:05.883
You're not ice cream!

02:05.888 --> 02:06.552
Faker.

02:08.988 --> 02:10.693
Ice cream man, wait!

02:10.835 --> 02:11.960
You're fired!

02:12.665 --> 02:13.890
As for the rest of you,

02:14.006 --> 02:16.121
you're supposed to be a chair-hockey team!

02:16.125 --> 02:18.141
All I see is five showboaters.

02:18.245 --> 02:20.700
Now sit down and give me 50 twirls.

02:21.838 --> 02:22.993
That's more like it.

02:25.186 --> 02:26.241
Ice cream man!

02:26.695 --> 02:27.692
Ice cream man!

02:29.718 --> 02:31.060
Homer, there you are.

02:31.066 --> 02:33.712
What does my best customer want today?

02:33.778 --> 02:35.743
One butter-crusted choco-rocket, please.

02:35.748 --> 02:38.320
I wish I had more customers like you.

02:38.477 --> 02:41.340
Oh, I'm barely scraping by.

02:41.345 --> 02:43.843
Yeah, this economy is tough on everyone.

02:43.998 --> 02:44.760
Change a hundred?

02:44.857 --> 02:46.513
Sure. That's $1.50,

02:46.537 --> 02:48.861
$1.75, $2.00...

02:51.465 --> 02:53.121
$99.50,

02:54.238 --> 02:56.141
$99 euh

02:56.285 --> 02:57.542
.75...

03:01.878 --> 03:03.730
Noooo...!

03:30.658 --> 03:32.700
You must be Homer.

03:32.706 --> 03:34.873
Huh? Max told you about me?

03:34.875 --> 03:36.242
Oh, yes.

03:36.247 --> 03:39.610
Max loved to talk about his work.

03:39.727 --> 03:42.190
How he bored me.

03:42.198 --> 03:44.482
And now I'm left with nothing

03:44.488 --> 03:48.063
but my lover and this worthless truck.

03:48.425 --> 03:49.382
Wait a minute.

03:49.475 --> 03:52.271
You don't want the truck, I need a job,

03:52.337 --> 03:55.790
you need money, I'm flush with severance pay...

03:55.868 --> 03:57.390
You'll buy Max's truck?

03:57.498 --> 03:58.473
Why, doesn't he need it?

03:58.876 --> 03:59.733
Oh, right.

03:59.978 --> 04:02.203
Remember that crappy ice cream truck I bought?

04:02.265 --> 04:03.541
How can we forget?

04:03.578 --> 04:06.821
Mom says now we can't afford to go to the orthodontist.

04:06.915 --> 04:10.133
Well, sink your crooked, rotting teeth into this!

04:13.277 --> 04:14.592
* Get your freak on

04:14.596 --> 04:17.382
* Get your freak on, get your freak on *

04:17.607 --> 04:18.930
* Get your freak on

04:19.035 --> 04:21.732
* Get your freak on, get your freak on *

04:21.735 --> 04:24.060
* Getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha, get your freak on *

04:24.067 --> 04:26.853
* Get your freak on, get your freak on. *

04:26.855 --> 04:28.293
Whoa! Whoa!

04:28.297 --> 04:29.120
Boy!

04:29.287 --> 04:32.403
Otto, you totally pimped Dad's ride!

04:32.915 --> 04:34.922
He was following my design

04:36.307 --> 04:40.032
And now to get dressed in a most unusual way.

05:17.126 --> 05:18.670
Butter-brickle!

05:24.217 --> 05:25.343
Welcome  back.

05:25.347 --> 05:27.302
Today, we're celebrating women

05:27.307 --> 05:30.433
who didn't waste their lives being mommies.

05:30.437 --> 05:32.872
Professor Stein, tell us about your book,

05:32.876 --> 05:34.701
Life Beyond Wife.

05:34.705 --> 05:36.943
Well, Opal, it's about women

05:36.957 --> 05:39.121
who want to breast-feed their own dreams

05:39.125 --> 05:41.712
and change the poopy diapers of fulfillment.

05:45.118 --> 05:47.480
I call it leaving your "lega-she."

05:49.328 --> 05:51.060
Does this book have any examples?

05:51.065 --> 05:52.293
Yes, eight!

05:53.187 --> 05:54.322
Take Gail Tucker.

05:54.325 --> 05:56.013
She wrote hip-hop lyrics

05:56.017 --> 05:59.280
to the beat of her washing machine with an off-center load.

05:59.345 --> 06:01.662
Last year, she won all the Grammys.

06:02.948 --> 06:06.960
Or how about Becky Tyson, who invented the pink VCR.

06:06.996 --> 06:09.230
Now her husband asks her for money

06:09.235 --> 06:12.072
or as I call it: "mon-she."

06:12.116 --> 06:13.223
You go, girl!

06:15.048 --> 06:17.332
All those women are so impressive.

06:17.355 --> 06:20.961
I've been doing the same thing for the last ten years.

06:21.067 --> 06:24.132
And all I have to show for it is a clean floor.

06:27.428 --> 06:29.761
My lega-she .

06:29.898 --> 06:31.453
Oh.

06:32.936 --> 06:34.663
Boy, it's hot.

06:34.668 --> 06:38.981
I feel like Icarus, flying too close to Apollo's golden orb.

06:40.476 --> 06:42.290
Punch away, Nelson.

06:43.475 --> 06:44.631
It's too hot.

06:44.636 --> 06:46.071
I'll get you later.

06:46.127 --> 06:47.982
I'll pencil you in for next week.

06:47.988 --> 06:49.511
Eh, what the hell.

07:04.518 --> 07:06.440
You kids like ice cream?

07:07.198 --> 07:09.141
Product  contains neither ice nor cream.

07:09.145 --> 07:10.940
May contain trace elements of Mexican cheese.

07:10.958 --> 07:11.910
Do not consume.

07:15.305 --> 07:16.783
I'm a unitard.

07:20.475 --> 07:21.890
What's the matter, son?

07:21.897 --> 07:23.900
Don't you have enough money for ice cream?

07:23.908 --> 07:26.713
I do, but I'm lactose-intolerant.

07:27.988 --> 07:30.883
Son, I will not stand for intolerance.

07:31.045 --> 07:33.870
You give this delightful frozen treat the same respect

07:33.877 --> 07:35.980
you would give any lactose-free food.

07:36.116 --> 07:37.750
God bless America.

07:37.936 --> 07:39.310
But my doctor says...

07:39.318 --> 07:41.971
I said, God bless America.

07:47.015 --> 07:50.503
Call the number on my bracelet.

07:50.637 --> 07:53.950
Ooh, thomeone wearth a brathelet.

07:53.956 --> 07:55.402
Who'th your boyfriend?

07:55.407 --> 07:57.342
Uh... Dr. Osterberg?

08:02.146 --> 08:04.651
Whoa, Marge, for the first time in my life,

08:04.667 --> 08:06.671
I'm excited about going to work.

08:06.687 --> 08:10.371
I'm glad someone in this house feels their life has meaning.

08:10.375 --> 08:11.323
You're glad?

08:11.385 --> 08:12.642
You don't look glad.

08:12.646 --> 08:15.100
Are you sure you know what "glad" means?

08:15.212 --> 08:19.081
I just wish I could do something to be remembered by,

08:19.082 --> 08:22.054
something that says "Marge was here"

08:22.059 --> 08:23.310
after I'm gone.

08:23.319 --> 08:26.490
Oh, honey, what about the time...

08:26.517 --> 08:28.640
Everybody loved that.

08:30.077 --> 08:30.731
Love you.

08:34.246 --> 08:35.902
Ah, the story of my life.

08:35.907 --> 08:38.549
They get the Popsicles, I get the sticks.

08:47.925 --> 08:51.053
Look, Maggie, I made another you.

08:51.056 --> 08:53.482
Out of sticky orange wood.

08:55.866 --> 08:57.200
Marge, I was...

08:57.206 --> 08:58.603
Folk art!

08:58.605 --> 09:01.163
That's my favorite kind of folk medium.

09:01.168 --> 09:02.950
I made it myself.

09:03.726 --> 09:05.302
Marge, you're a genius.

09:05.308 --> 09:07.251
You should make sculptures of other people.

09:07.255 --> 09:08.502
Like Lenny, or Carl

09:08.508 --> 09:09.991
or the new James Bond.

09:09.997 --> 09:12.461
Will America accept a British James Bond?

09:12.465 --> 09:13.982
I can't wait to find out.

09:46.927 --> 09:48.013
This is Kent Brockman.

09:48.016 --> 09:49.782
A high-speed pursuit is taking place

09:49.787 --> 09:51.823
on the streets of Springfield.

09:51.827 --> 09:54.232
We responded immediately after seeing it on Channels 2,

09:54.236 --> 09:56.403
four, five, seven and 63.

09:56.408 --> 09:58.283
The driver is getting out of his car

09:58.285 --> 09:59.791
he's running to a helipad,

09:59.798 --> 10:01.382
he's taking off in a copter.

10:01.388 --> 10:03.032
Why, here he is next to us.

10:03.035 --> 10:05.720
Kent, there seems to be a traffic tie-up

10:05.726 --> 10:09.050
at the 101-405 interchange.

10:09.057 --> 10:11.803
I recommend taking surface streets.

10:11.847 --> 10:13.872
Jailbird  away.

10:13.876 --> 10:15.220
Well, there you have it, people...

10:15.226 --> 10:17.033
Sweet Morley Safer!

10:17.035 --> 10:18.890
Do I see a telegenic housewife

10:18.897 --> 10:21.073
making art out of Popsicle sticks?

10:21.075 --> 10:22.820
Set this baby down

10:22.827 --> 10:25.260
I smell soft news.

10:28.236 --> 10:30.801
Ma'am, I'd like to feature you on my award-submitted segment,

10:30.807 --> 10:33.030
Kent Brockman's "Kent-resting People".

10:33.038 --> 10:36.330
Really? You think people would be Kent-rested in me?

10:36.345 --> 10:37.331
I do.

10:37.826 --> 10:38.652
Hm!

10:38.845 --> 10:42.360
I'm here with local sculptoress Marge Simpson who works in,

10:42.367 --> 10:44.542
of all media, Popsicle stick.

10:44.566 --> 10:48.631
Our viewers want to know two things: why, and how come?

10:48.636 --> 10:51.402
Why did cavemen paint on walls?

10:51.456 --> 10:53.551
Why do you scratch your name on Tupperware?

10:53.558 --> 10:56.132
So when you die, something's left behind

10:56.147 --> 10:59.621
that says, "I was here, I mattered.

10:59.625 --> 11:01.482
That's my Tupperware."

11:01.585 --> 11:04.533
Human feelings, expressed by a human.

11:04.687 --> 11:08.000
And here's a local nobody enjoying his likeness.

11:08.007 --> 11:09.630
Let's take a sneaky-peeky.

11:10.207 --> 11:12.010
My God, it's beauty-ful.

11:12.035 --> 11:14.573
I finally see the goodness in myself.

11:14.846 --> 11:15.912
Come here, you.

11:15.977 --> 11:18.461
Oh, I'm so glad you like it, Moe.

11:18.945 --> 11:22.123
That's right, tell me all your little wooden dreams.

11:22.625 --> 11:24.790
You're not alone anymore. No you ain't.

11:25.628 --> 11:28.002
Aw, you're shivering, are you cold?

11:28.406 --> 11:29.552
Where you goin', Marge?

11:30.408 --> 11:32.101
Honey, I brought you more sticks.

11:33.506 --> 11:36.551
This is the most fun I've
ever had giving you wood.

11:36.987 --> 11:40.181
Homie, this sculpting has
made me feel so fulfilled.

11:40.187 --> 11:44.340
I'm  as hopeful and full of life as
I was in the years before I met you.

11:44.446 --> 11:46.372
It's good to see you smile again.

11:46.475 --> 11:49.100
I was lonely being
happy all by myself.

11:49.205 --> 11:52.432
Well, no one's gonna be lonely tonight.

11:56.905 --> 11:58.841
Let me just put on some romantic music.

12:05.308 --> 12:09.352
Hey, we got the whole night, baby ,
let's slow things down.

12:23.405 --> 12:25.800
Marge, you are one fantastic artist,

12:26.005 --> 12:29.330
and no one knows art like
a Texan with too much money.

12:29.378 --> 12:31.653
- You're from Texas?
- That's right.

12:31.756 --> 12:35.202
And I want to finance
a fancy-shmancy art show,

12:35.308 --> 12:37.252
starring your wooden wonders.

12:40.125 --> 12:42.753
My own art show?
I'm so happy.

12:43.056 --> 12:44.051
Do you mind?

12:47.207 --> 12:48.902
I'm excited you're excited.

12:51.758 --> 12:53.591
Shoot  on the "yee," not the "hah."

12:55.385 --> 12:56.380
Hey lady,

12:56.386 --> 12:58.322
you gotta pay to use my likeness.

12:58.526 --> 13:00.251
It's a registered trademark.

13:03.958 --> 13:06.050
Hey, I do more than TV.

13:06.255 --> 13:08.421
I had a one-man show on Broadway.

13:08.425 --> 13:10.292
That's who showed up-- one man.

13:12.608 --> 13:14.931
Long story short,
I won a Drama Desk Award.

13:16.005 --> 13:18.352
Marge, everything looks wonderful.

13:18.456 --> 13:20.593
Well, I'm off to pedal
my frosty wares.

13:21.055 --> 13:22.330
You can't go to work.

13:22.437 --> 13:24.903
I need you here for emotional support.

13:25.006 --> 13:27.201
Plus you make a small crowd look huge.

13:27.506 --> 13:30.251
Sweetie, I can't abandon
my route even for one day.

13:30.355 --> 13:32.782
If those kids discover the
link between eating right

13:32.837 --> 13:34.952
and feeling good, I am screwed.

13:35.257 --> 13:37.201
But I'll be back in time for your show.

13:37.406 --> 13:38.622
The show starts at 3:00.

13:38.728 --> 13:41.783
- You promise you'll be here?
- I would never let you down.

13:41.987 --> 13:44.723
Our marriage is like soft-serve ice cream.

13:44.725 --> 13:47.502
And trust is the hard
chocolate shell that keeps it

13:47.608 --> 13:49.470
from melting on to our carpet.

13:49.577 --> 13:54.200
In "cone-clusion," here's the scoop:
I love you.

14:04.787 --> 14:06.603
What the hell do you kids want?!

14:06.907 --> 14:08.171
Oh, right, ice cream.

14:15.007 --> 14:17.630
Oh, my God.
It's the opportunity of a lifetime.

14:18.406 --> 14:19.592
Attention, losers:

14:19.798 --> 14:22.631
this is your chance to buy
your kids some frozen love.

14:22.836 --> 14:25.252
I'm not going to fall for
such a cheap stunt.

14:25.357 --> 14:26.500
Mom would.

14:26.607 --> 14:27.980
Hey, give me one of everything!

14:37.938 --> 14:39.182
Sorry, I'm all out of ice cream.

14:39.285 --> 14:42.390
Already? It's only 38 seconds to 3:00.

14:42.998 --> 14:43.922
Marge's show!

14:51.708 --> 14:53.380
Must jettison excess weight.

14:57.308 --> 14:58.101
D'oh!

15:03.606 --> 15:04.351
Oh, my God.

15:04.457 --> 15:06.581
I only got nine seconds till Marge's show.

15:06.788 --> 15:08.802
Eight... seven...

15:09.758 --> 15:12.030
Homer, where are you?

15:15.057 --> 15:16.742
Oh, I'll never make it.

15:17.666 --> 15:18.851
Unless...

15:23.405 --> 15:26.000
Whoo-hoo! I'm going to be on time.

15:51.307 --> 15:52.453
No, no, no, save your energy.

15:52.855 --> 15:53.750
Don't try to talk.

15:54.106 --> 15:56.500
I don't know where
Carl ends and I begin.

15:56.707 --> 15:59.501
See, statements like that are
why people think we're gay.

16:03.406 --> 16:06.342
I made it back for your show, honey...

16:06.548 --> 16:10.202
Well, Homer, you destroyed
my artwork and my dreams.

16:10.505 --> 16:12.753
Good job, very thorough.

16:14.138 --> 16:15.952
Marge, let me explain.

16:16.156 --> 16:19.503
I had a chance to make a little more 
money by exploiting broken families...

16:19.607 --> 16:21.232
Oh, stop, just stop.

16:21.335 --> 16:23.982
You don't care about anyone 
else's happiness but your own.

16:26.105 --> 16:31.752
Well, excuse me for having enormous
flaws that I don't work on!

16:36.608 --> 16:37.363
Marge?

16:38.205 --> 16:38.930
Marge?

16:39.238 --> 16:41.430
Honey, you've been in there all day.

16:41.536 --> 16:43.202
You got to eat something.

16:43.808 --> 16:46.423
Why don't you come
downstairs and cook dinner?

16:46.627 --> 16:48.053
Lasagna would be awesome.

16:49.207 --> 16:49.902
Marge?

16:57.207 --> 16:57.902
Marge?

16:58.006 --> 17:02.323
I e you a check for $300
to pay for all the sculptures I broke.

17:02.428 --> 17:03.493
Okay?

17:05.406 --> 17:06.321
Oh, I see.

17:06.425 --> 17:08.640
You'd prefer a wire transfer.

17:08.846 --> 17:10.701
Well, what's your routing number?

17:11.406 --> 17:13.852
That's okay, I can get it
from the bank, honey.

17:13.958 --> 17:15.501
I just need to know your birthday.

17:21.906 --> 17:24.683
Marge? I have an apology
that I hope is better

17:24.734 --> 17:27.241
than all the other ones,
so please listen carefully.

17:27.646 --> 17:30.422
The thing I liked best about
being an ice cream man

17:30.427 --> 17:34.000
wasn't the free ice cream
or the colorful toppings,

17:34.107 --> 17:36.823
or the love I received
from obese children.

17:37.127 --> 17:40.333
It was giving you those sticks,
and watching you smile

17:40.438 --> 17:41.643
as you turned them into art.

17:43.205 --> 17:45.203
If it would win you back,
I would gradually eat

17:45.307 --> 17:47.290
all the parts of a motorcycle.

17:47.498 --> 17:49.153
I hope it doesn't come to that.

17:49.655 --> 17:53.703
Could you please just give me a sign
that you still love me a little?

17:55.606 --> 17:58.601
If you won't talk to me,
I'll send in Polaroids

17:58.706 --> 18:01.852
to show you how sad I am
that I let you down.

18:17.906 --> 18:19.100
I'm laughing in the last one,

18:19.206 --> 18:21.282
but it's only 'cause the
cat fell down the stairs.

18:32.908 --> 18:34.263
Marge? Marge?!

18:34.467 --> 18:37.302
- She's been gone for a while.
- Grampa's been watching us.

18:37.408 --> 18:40.552
You kids have been real good tonight.

18:41.505 --> 18:44.000
Mom! Mom!

18:44.028 --> 18:45.502
Marge, where are you?!

18:45.708 --> 18:49.173
Did you change your name?
Is it Kelly?

18:49.377 --> 18:50.503
Kelly!

18:51.107 --> 18:53.180
Comic Book Guy, have you seen our mom?

18:53.486 --> 18:57.580
A complete list of things I have seen
or not seen is available on my blog.

18:57.587 --> 19:01.002
Your mother is on the "not seen" list,
along with "a Star Wars film

19:01.105 --> 19:02.703
that was any good since the first one."

19:02.707 --> 19:05.480
And even that has been ruined by CGI additions.

19:05.588 --> 19:07.153
Bravo, George.

19:07.957 --> 19:08.850
There's Mom!

19:09.897 --> 19:11.100
Oh, my God-- she's going to jump.

19:11.305 --> 19:14.480
Marge, don't do it!
Give divorce a chance!

19:14.887 --> 19:18.342
Homer, I want to show the
world how I feel about you.

19:18.548 --> 19:20.101
The world's not that interested.

19:20.408 --> 19:21.681
They will be.

19:22.706 --> 19:25.152
- Ready, bullies?
- Ready.

19:33.857 --> 19:37.791
Homer, you wanted a sign
that I still love you, so here it is.

19:39.408 --> 19:41.803
You made me a sculpture of Magilla Gorilla.

19:42.007 --> 19:43.782
No, Homer.

19:43.886 --> 19:48.502
It's you-- my sweet,
perfectly imperfect you.

19:49.205 --> 19:52.672
Okay, boys, on my command, fire.

19:52.777 --> 19:54.333
But nobody's done
anything wrong.

19:54.538 --> 19:57.323
Geez, if everyone was like you,
our morgues would be empty.

19:57.828 --> 20:01.000
Homie, I realized
that my most enduring creation

20:01.208 --> 20:04.251
is the life
I've sculpted with you.

20:06.007 --> 20:10.003
Now I know that my lega-she
is really a lega-we.

20:11.855 --> 20:13.843
I just have one question,
my darling:

20:13.897 --> 20:16.001
What did you do with the ice cream
that was on all those sticks?

20:16.107 --> 20:17.420
It's in that Dumpster.

20:27.307 --> 20:28.892
Not that one!

20:32.548 --> 20:36.901
This statue, subject unknown,
is the last remaining example

20:37.005 --> 20:39.832
of art before the collapse
of the western world.

20:39.938 --> 20:43.060
If only we'd known that iPods
would unite and overthrow

20:43.067 --> 20:45.231
the very humans
they entertained.

20:46.806 --> 20:49.182
- What do you want from us?!
- Nothing.

20:49.285 --> 20:51.753
We just like whipping.

20:52.305 --> 20:58.173
