00:00.001 --> 00:01.140
_

00:01.164 --> 00:03.670
Shuttin' down your ex‐husband's wedding!

00:03.695 --> 00:05.073
Now let's dish.

00:06.103 --> 00:08.635
Okay, so, Will and I drive
up to the drive‐through,

00:08.660 --> 00:09.805
and who's there?

00:09.830 --> 00:11.331
My ex. Graham's dad.

00:11.356 --> 00:13.023
And how'd that deadbeat look?

00:13.048 --> 00:15.017
- Disgusting... ly hot!
- Ohh!

00:15.042 --> 00:16.430
- "Charlie's Angels"!
- Yeah.

00:17.869 --> 00:21.164
Okay, and then Derek gave
me his e‐mail address

00:21.189 --> 00:22.899
on one of his old CDs.

00:22.924 --> 00:24.578
What?! Angie, are you gonna use it?

00:24.603 --> 00:26.845
Wait. Are we headed towards a
"Thelma & Louise" situation?

00:26.869 --> 00:28.822
- No! I'm not gonna e‐mail that dummy.
- Okay.

00:29.143 --> 00:30.143
Look it!

00:30.213 --> 00:31.522
- Aaahhh!
- Aaahhh!

00:31.547 --> 00:34.000
Okay, good, because you know
how crazy he makes you.

00:34.025 --> 00:36.040
One mention of something
that happened nine years ago,

00:36.064 --> 00:37.469
and you are in Obsessed Town.

00:37.494 --> 00:38.516
Not anymore, okay?

00:38.541 --> 00:41.906
Turns out all I had to do was
have one last look at his face.

00:41.931 --> 00:43.289
- Mad closure.
- Good.

00:43.314 --> 00:45.233
Can't wait to see what I
blame my problems on now.

00:45.257 --> 00:46.695
- Probably your mom.
- Yeah.

00:46.720 --> 00:47.720
Prom.

00:47.745 --> 00:48.945
- Take me to prom.
- Mm!

00:48.970 --> 00:49.970
Hey.

00:50.415 --> 00:52.391
Alright, well, you successfully rode out

00:52.416 --> 00:54.133
your ex‐husband's wedding,

00:54.158 --> 00:55.664
so what do you say we leave?

00:55.689 --> 00:57.282
Okay, come on, Douglas.
Let's take a picture.

00:57.306 --> 00:58.306
Eh...

00:58.399 --> 01:00.312
O‐Okay, but I refuse to do a fun one.

01:00.337 --> 01:01.712
Hold up! Are we doing a group photo?

01:01.713 --> 01:03.220
Miggy! Miggy!

01:03.245 --> 01:04.385
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ooh, ooh, ooh!

01:04.409 --> 01:06.009
- Dibs on the fake saxophone!
- Ooh.

01:06.384 --> 01:08.260
Wait. You know what I just realized?

01:08.285 --> 01:09.994
Sophie and Graham are at Space Camp,

01:10.019 --> 01:12.025
Rory's going with Ron and
Sharon on their honeymoon...

01:12.049 --> 01:13.341
not a great sign...

01:13.366 --> 01:15.243
and the twins are with
their kinda hot grandma.

01:15.268 --> 01:17.024
Are we looking at a kid‐free summer?

01:17.049 --> 01:18.050
- Totally unprecedented.
- Oh, my God.

01:18.074 --> 01:19.603
This'll have little effect
on my day‐to‐day.

01:19.627 --> 01:21.782
Guys? Really? I mean, Jack's not even 2.

01:21.807 --> 01:23.102
I'll have him the entire time.

01:23.127 --> 01:24.727
A kid‐free summer!

01:24.752 --> 01:26.422
- Dirty little secret?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:26.447 --> 01:27.517
Shhh.

01:27.541 --> 01:29.533
Okay, so, let's get some
parties on the books, alright?

01:29.557 --> 01:31.678
We can take turns hosting.
That way, we can see each other.

01:31.702 --> 01:32.985
Oh, I'll be seeing you.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.188
Ohh. Okay.

01:36.870 --> 01:39.852
Alright, guys, summer starts now!

01:39.877 --> 01:41.485
Whoo!

01:48.803 --> 01:52.559
_

01:56.217 --> 01:58.575
Oh! Hey.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.433
Person who didn't think
that I could pull off a party.

02:01.458 --> 02:02.459
Well, check it. Here.

02:02.483 --> 02:05.567
We have saltines,
a nice spread of breakfast cereal,

02:05.592 --> 02:07.154
and some snacks that
I've been collecting

02:07.178 --> 02:08.303
from Southwest flights.

02:08.328 --> 02:09.537
Nailed it.

02:09.562 --> 02:10.652
Where's your, uh,

02:10.678 --> 02:13.054
work boss/life girlfriend, Tracy Freeze?

02:13.079 --> 02:14.955
Well, we've been
hanging out quite a bit,

02:14.980 --> 02:16.802
but we're keeping things
pretty casual right now.

02:16.826 --> 02:19.683
And that is the perfect attitude
for the summer of freedom.

02:19.708 --> 02:20.997
- Summer!
- Summer!

02:21.022 --> 02:22.317
Whoo!

02:22.342 --> 02:26.128
This is the exact reason why we made

02:26.153 --> 02:28.629
Angie and Will's List of Summer Fun!

02:28.654 --> 02:29.943
Mm. Yes, yes, yes. Yes.

02:29.968 --> 02:31.379
- Shall we review?
- We shall.

02:31.404 --> 02:33.322
I'm excited about the wine tasting. Ooh!

02:33.347 --> 02:34.942
I'm very excited for that pinball bar

02:34.967 --> 02:37.512
where everybody's gonna be 23 and,
therefore, terrifying.

02:37.537 --> 02:39.122
- Karaoke. ♪ Duh! ♪
- Our thing.

02:39.147 --> 02:40.787
And I can finally visit the dog shelter

02:40.812 --> 02:43.166
without having to worry about
Sophie's crippling bulldog allergy.

02:43.190 --> 02:44.190
- Yeah, what a drag.
- Yeah.

02:44.191 --> 02:45.816
Ooh! And the crown jewel...

02:45.817 --> 02:47.356
that Bavarian sausage house

02:47.381 --> 02:49.840
where you get free sausage
for your birthday!

02:49.865 --> 02:51.090
I don't know how I feel about lying.

02:51.114 --> 02:52.434
My birthday's not until October.

02:52.459 --> 02:53.840
Come on. You know the saying...

02:53.865 --> 02:56.481
it's not summer unless
you're lying to some Germans.

02:56.506 --> 02:58.090
Hey, Angie.

02:58.465 --> 03:00.414
Ah! Gus.

03:00.415 --> 03:02.833
My friend and my exterminator.

03:02.834 --> 03:04.418
And you come bearing gifts.

03:04.419 --> 03:05.670
He was raised right.

03:05.671 --> 03:07.051
They're deviled eggs.

03:07.076 --> 03:08.618
Some of them aren't good.

03:08.882 --> 03:10.258
- Oh, my...
- Good God.

03:18.267 --> 03:19.809
Daaaamn!

03:19.834 --> 03:21.395
I'm getting second‐degree burns

03:21.420 --> 03:23.356
from all that fire!

03:23.381 --> 03:24.708
If that's the bad degree.

03:24.733 --> 03:26.622
Oh! Have you two gone on a date yet?

03:26.647 --> 03:27.801
No, Miggy.

03:27.826 --> 03:30.973
I thought he was gonna ask me sooner,
but I don't know.

03:30.998 --> 03:32.498
I think he's just taking his time.

03:32.523 --> 03:34.583
He's taking his time?

03:34.608 --> 03:36.770
The Poppy I know doesn't
wait for anybody.

03:36.795 --> 03:38.596
That's why you're always
leaving me at the mall.

03:38.620 --> 03:40.192
- Mm.
- Mm‐hmm.

03:40.217 --> 03:42.676
Jack! What'd I tell
you about the Sharpies?

03:42.701 --> 03:44.434
The wall, man, not the mouth.

03:44.459 --> 03:45.598
I'll get him.

03:46.696 --> 03:49.208
Oh, man, this party is the pits.

03:49.233 --> 03:52.840
No spread, no bartender, no live piano.

03:52.865 --> 03:54.324
Dude, what's the deal?

03:54.349 --> 03:55.934
Why haven't you asked out Poppy yet?

03:55.959 --> 03:58.911
Well, if you must know,
I'm gonna ask her tonight.

03:58.936 --> 04:01.419
I just had to, you know,
secure all the details.

04:01.444 --> 04:03.622
You see, women are fearful creatures...

04:03.647 --> 04:05.314
you know, skittish, like cats,

04:05.339 --> 04:07.833
and if you put them in an
unpredictable environment,

04:07.858 --> 04:09.450
well, they panic.

04:09.475 --> 04:12.754
That's why they want the man
to make all the decisions.

04:12.779 --> 04:14.172
They also hate the car.

04:14.197 --> 04:16.793
Yeah, I get that.
But see, Poppy's a modern woman.

04:16.819 --> 04:18.028
She's not your usual type.

04:18.053 --> 04:19.536
You're gonna need some new moves.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.812
Eh. All women are the same.

04:21.837 --> 04:23.546
O‐O‐Okay. Here she comes.

04:23.571 --> 04:25.333
Watch and learn.

04:25.917 --> 04:27.973
- Okay, tagging you back in.
- Yeah.

04:27.998 --> 04:29.356
He somehow took his diaper off

04:29.381 --> 04:30.654
yet is still wearing his shorts.

04:32.714 --> 04:35.356
Uh, Ms. Banks,
I would like to inform you

04:35.381 --> 04:37.622
of your plans next Wednesday.

04:37.647 --> 04:39.294
Hey, do you want to go on a date?

04:40.599 --> 04:42.286
W‐Well, I...

04:43.364 --> 04:44.786
Calendars...

04:45.286 --> 04:46.583
appointments...

04:46.608 --> 04:51.106
O‐Okay, are you short‐circuiting
or what's... going... on?

04:51.131 --> 04:53.208
Oh. Is it because a
woman's asking you out?

04:53.233 --> 04:54.440
No!

04:54.465 --> 04:56.278
I‐lt's new.

04:56.303 --> 04:58.388
But, uh, y‐yes.

04:58.413 --> 05:00.309
Yes. It would be my pleasure.

05:00.334 --> 05:01.877
Good. Great.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.708
Um, I'll pick you up Tuesday.

05:03.733 --> 05:05.872
I know this great vegan joint.

05:06.603 --> 05:08.477
Just kidding. We'll get steak.

05:13.451 --> 05:14.950
- Guess what.
- What?

05:14.975 --> 05:17.044
That wine bar is having
a tasting tonight.

05:17.069 --> 05:18.185
We could go straight from here.

05:18.209 --> 05:19.598
Love it. Let's do it!

05:19.623 --> 05:20.623
Okay!

05:20.648 --> 05:22.274
Everyone out!

05:22.299 --> 05:23.950
I'm doing something else now.

05:23.975 --> 05:25.114
I mean it.

05:25.139 --> 05:26.786
- What?
- Oh, really?

05:26.811 --> 05:27.833
This is it.

05:27.858 --> 05:30.624
Yeah, sorry, I sort of meant,
like, after the party,

05:30.649 --> 05:31.887
but this is cool, too.

05:31.912 --> 05:34.473
Uh, is that a CD shard in your pocket?

05:36.977 --> 05:40.575
You know, just can't stop
thinking about e‐mailing Derek,

05:40.600 --> 05:42.700
you know, just to yell
at him one last time,

05:42.725 --> 05:44.645
just hit him with the old "Yo, D‐bag,

05:44.670 --> 05:47.161
do you have any idea how..."

05:47.541 --> 05:48.666
Mm.

05:50.014 --> 05:51.459
Something is...

05:52.584 --> 05:55.047
happening... inside me.

05:55.048 --> 05:56.794
- Feelings?
- Oh, yes.

05:56.819 --> 05:57.819
Feelings.

05:59.036 --> 06:02.067
I just got to... shove those back down.

06:05.827 --> 06:06.827
Okay.

06:06.852 --> 06:08.310
That was close.

06:08.311 --> 06:09.520
- Um...
- All better now.

06:09.545 --> 06:12.723
No! Angie,
you got to let that bad stuff out.

06:12.748 --> 06:14.145
It's like my Nana always says...

06:14.170 --> 06:16.513
if you don't let the steam out
of the kettle, it gets too loud.

06:16.537 --> 06:18.329
Well, your Nana was stupid!

06:18.354 --> 06:20.012
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

06:20.037 --> 06:22.634
I'm not e‐mailing Derek. End of story.

06:22.659 --> 06:23.801
Alright.

06:24.122 --> 06:26.747
But if I were,

06:26.772 --> 06:29.747
you know it would be the
e‐mail of the century.

06:29.772 --> 06:32.067
It would be eight years of rage.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.969
I would find a way
to use the word "butthole"

06:34.994 --> 06:36.989
as a noun and a verb.

06:37.014 --> 06:38.778
You're kind of obsessing about this,

06:38.803 --> 06:40.715
and I think you need
to write this e‐mail.

06:40.740 --> 06:41.755
Like, now.

06:41.780 --> 06:43.613
Yes. Yeah.

06:43.638 --> 06:44.930
You know what?

06:44.931 --> 06:46.614
I can't let this hang over

06:46.639 --> 06:48.223
Angie and Will's List of Summer Fun.

06:48.248 --> 06:50.926
I'm gonna go destroy Derek.

06:52.322 --> 06:53.948
Oh, what about the wine tasting?

06:53.980 --> 06:55.841
How about I head over there now,
get us a table,

06:55.865 --> 06:57.574
strike up some heat with the server?

06:57.599 --> 06:58.724
- Meet you there.
- Yeah.

06:58.749 --> 07:00.255
- Summer!
- Summer! Summer

07:00.279 --> 07:01.923
Summer!

07:05.428 --> 07:08.208
Uh, sir, some of the
patrons are complaining

07:08.233 --> 07:09.483
that you look lonely.

07:09.508 --> 07:10.842
My friend's coming.

07:10.867 --> 07:12.517
That's the spirit, sir.

07:17.483 --> 07:19.075
_

07:25.464 --> 07:26.826
_

07:28.804 --> 07:30.164
_

07:30.375 --> 07:33.789
_

07:34.360 --> 07:36.093
Welcome to our party!

07:36.118 --> 07:39.281
Please enjoy our selection of
fine organic California wines.

07:39.306 --> 07:41.992
From all 58 counties
of this great state.

07:42.017 --> 07:43.515
Maybe skip the Fresno ones.

07:43.540 --> 07:44.726
Enjoy.

07:45.037 --> 07:47.455
I, for one, am trying them all.

07:47.687 --> 07:48.806
- I'm gonna...
- Yeah, would you?

07:48.830 --> 07:50.422
Mm‐hmm. Hey, Guy.

07:50.447 --> 07:52.189
Maybe go easy on the wine?

07:52.214 --> 07:53.214
- Ohhh!
- Mm.

07:53.251 --> 07:54.376
Thanks for having me.

07:54.377 --> 07:55.400
Of course.

07:55.425 --> 07:56.717
Our party?

07:56.742 --> 07:57.932
Seems like you and Tracy

07:57.956 --> 07:59.634
have gotten serious this summer.

07:59.659 --> 08:01.197
I don't know.

08:01.222 --> 08:02.806
Is sex serious?

08:02.831 --> 08:04.423
What?! Will Cooper.

08:04.448 --> 08:06.290
Good for you!

08:06.315 --> 08:07.642
That's what I'm talkin' about.

08:07.667 --> 08:09.417
- Summer lovin'. Yeah.
- Thank you. Mm‐hmm.

08:09.442 --> 08:10.651
Had a little of that myself.

08:10.676 --> 08:12.884
Oh, that's right. Poppy's in the game!

08:13.491 --> 08:14.931
Where is Douglas, by the way?

08:14.956 --> 08:16.095
How would I know?

08:16.120 --> 08:18.392
You remember Gus, from Angie's party?

08:18.417 --> 08:20.462
Can you believe she asked me out?

08:20.487 --> 08:22.556
Love a woman that takes charge.

08:22.581 --> 08:25.717
P.S... you have a
serious silverfish situation.

08:26.948 --> 08:28.782
Let's take a lap, Gus. Okay.

08:34.392 --> 08:36.001
Angie. Hey.

08:36.025 --> 08:37.173
Where have you been?

08:37.198 --> 08:39.188
And are you wearing
maternity sweatpants?

08:39.214 --> 08:41.501
C‐Could you move it along?
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

08:41.525 --> 08:43.152
Okay, I haven't...
I haven't seen you in like a month.

08:43.176 --> 08:44.502
I feel like we have
a lot to catch up on.

08:44.526 --> 08:46.712
Have... you talked to
Poppy about Douglas?

08:46.737 --> 08:47.820
Oh, yeah.

08:47.845 --> 08:49.220
She's... with Gus now.

08:49.245 --> 08:51.010
And you didn't tell me?
This is a major scandal.

08:51.034 --> 08:52.182
If our friend group was America,

08:52.206 --> 08:53.620
this would be on the cover
of People magazine.

08:53.644 --> 08:55.142
Okay, can we talk about this later?

08:55.167 --> 08:56.533
I'm writing the e‐mail to Derek.

08:56.558 --> 08:58.002
Really? He wrote you back?
What did he say?

08:58.026 --> 09:00.525
No. I'm writing the e‐mail to Derek.

09:00.550 --> 09:01.767
Still?

09:01.792 --> 09:03.293
How is that possible?

09:03.318 --> 09:04.573
Because I‐I need it to be perfect.

09:04.597 --> 09:07.010
This is the last thing that I'm
ever gonna say to this jackass,

09:07.034 --> 09:08.681
and I‐I got to get it right.

09:08.706 --> 09:09.776
Wait, I...

09:09.800 --> 09:11.784
So, this is what you've been
doing for the entire month?

09:11.808 --> 09:15.042
This is why we haven't done our
summer distraction plan...

09:15.067 --> 09:18.245
the wine tastings,
the visit to the Sriracha factory,

09:18.270 --> 09:20.847
getting stoned on melatonin and
going to the butterfly pavilion?

09:20.872 --> 09:22.499
Could you take a look at this?
I could use some feedback.

09:24.193 --> 09:25.847
"Hey, bu..." Oh.

09:26.407 --> 09:27.651
Oh.

09:28.279 --> 09:30.776
I don't feel comfortable
reading this out loud.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.824
Well, Ms. Banks, I...
can't help but notice

09:36.849 --> 09:39.815
you're attending this party
with Angie's exterminator.

09:39.840 --> 09:43.753
Mm. Well, his name is Gus,
and he's built like a house.

09:44.840 --> 09:46.637
Poppy, Douglas,
what's going on with you two, huh?

09:46.661 --> 09:47.737
Is it my fault?

09:47.762 --> 09:49.558
- Nothing's going on.
- Damn right.

09:49.583 --> 09:51.961
Nothing's going on.

09:53.119 --> 09:55.198
- I can take a hint.
- Yeah?

09:56.077 --> 09:57.767
I'm gonna go eat a corn chip.

09:57.792 --> 09:59.169
Mm!

10:02.182 --> 10:03.222
I don't get it.

10:03.247 --> 10:05.354
You two were moony for each
other at Angie's party.

10:05.379 --> 10:06.630
I have to know what happened.

10:06.655 --> 10:08.683
- Tenant's rights.
- Alright, fine.

10:08.708 --> 10:10.809
I didn't want to gossip about
Douglas to our mutual friends,

10:10.833 --> 10:12.941
but I need the support,
so just promise to be cool, okay?

10:12.965 --> 10:14.633
Poppy, I don't have
to promise to be cool.

10:14.658 --> 10:15.729
I am cool.

10:15.754 --> 10:17.019
Look at the angle of my hat.

10:17.044 --> 10:18.650
- Got it. Alright.
- Mm‐hmm.

10:18.675 --> 10:23.198
Douglas and I went on the worst
first date in American history.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.862
At first, everything was going great.

10:27.000 --> 10:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:39.419 --> 10:40.956
And then what happened?

10:40.981 --> 10:42.917
That's it. Never spoke again.

10:43.032 --> 10:46.534
W... That man IRL ghosted you,
and you never got a reason?

10:46.559 --> 10:49.347
We all know the reason, Miggy.
It's because I asked him out.

10:49.372 --> 10:52.058
That's all it took to set his
old‐fashioned brain on fire

10:52.083 --> 10:53.956
and send him running into the night.

10:53.981 --> 10:56.370
I can't believe you actually
had to go through that.

10:56.395 --> 10:57.425
Thank you.

10:57.450 --> 10:58.855
And now I have to go murder Douglas.

10:58.879 --> 11:00.556
What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:00.581 --> 11:01.948
Just... leave him alone.

11:01.973 --> 11:04.621
You know, the fact that he has to
live the rest of his life as Douglas

11:04.645 --> 11:05.859
is punishment enough.

11:05.860 --> 11:06.862
Okay.

11:06.887 --> 11:08.425
But only because you're a queen...

11:08.450 --> 11:10.987
- Mm... Yes.
- An icon, a survivor.

11:11.012 --> 11:13.120
Hey, don't freakin' look at her!
What, what...

11:13.145 --> 11:14.800
- Miggy, Miggy.
- What's wrong with you?

11:16.453 --> 11:18.519
Why aren't you laughing?
This is the funny part.

11:18.544 --> 11:20.472
I think I need a break from this e‐mail.

11:20.826 --> 11:23.995
Maybe go watch some videos
of otters holding hands.

11:25.020 --> 11:26.479
Oh, my God! Will!

11:26.504 --> 11:29.003
We finally got the reservation
at that Bavarian sausage place.

11:29.028 --> 11:30.604
- Awesome!
- Yeah.

11:30.629 --> 11:32.558
- Oh. Bavarian sausage place?
- Oh.

11:32.583 --> 11:34.698
It's just part of this
crazy list we made

11:34.723 --> 11:37.276
to make sure that we have
the most fun summer ever.

11:37.301 --> 11:39.519
We call it the Will and Tracy List

11:39.544 --> 11:41.312
- of Summer Fun.
- ... Summer Fun.

11:41.313 --> 11:42.612
Wow.

11:42.741 --> 11:43.901
Cool.

11:44.188 --> 11:45.190
And great name.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.335
Love how it just says what it is.

11:47.360 --> 11:48.360
Yeah.

11:52.240 --> 11:53.315
Hey, Miggy.

11:53.340 --> 11:55.299
Jack is in the yard, huh?
Get in the game.

11:55.324 --> 11:58.081
Oh, I'm sorry, Douglas,
but I have to murder you now!

11:58.106 --> 11:59.524
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy!

11:59.548 --> 12:01.066
How could you do Poppy dirty like that?!

12:01.090 --> 12:02.392
Hey! Relax!

12:02.417 --> 12:04.019
Calm down. I...

12:05.597 --> 12:07.147
I had a heart attack.

12:07.172 --> 12:08.965
What? When?

12:21.356 --> 12:22.356
Tony.

12:22.381 --> 12:23.714
Cedars.

12:24.081 --> 12:25.694
Oh, my God.

12:25.719 --> 12:28.971
Douglas, here I thought you were
the worst person in the world.

12:28.981 --> 12:32.284
You're a king, an icon, a survivor.

12:32.309 --> 12:34.268
A‐Alright.
You don't have to throw me a parade.

12:34.293 --> 12:37.104
Half of my friends survived
a heart attack this summer.

12:37.323 --> 12:38.878
The other half...

12:39.654 --> 12:41.112
We have to tell Poppy the truth.

12:41.137 --> 12:43.104
- O‐Oh... N‐No, no, no.
- Yes!

12:44.782 --> 12:46.159
Okay, I'm sorry I'm doing

12:46.184 --> 12:48.060
the Bavarian sausage thing with Tracy.

12:48.085 --> 12:50.386
You are doing our entire list.

12:50.411 --> 12:52.176
In the words of my ninth
grade English teacher,

12:52.200 --> 12:53.238
"You can't just write your name

12:53.262 --> 12:54.793
on the top of someone
else's work, Angie."

12:54.817 --> 12:57.238
For the record, I called, I texted,

12:57.263 --> 12:58.425
I liked all your tweets,

12:58.450 --> 12:59.941
until I realized it
was a different Angie.

12:59.965 --> 13:02.269
I got nothing back.
I got blown off for an e‐mail.

13:02.294 --> 13:04.287
An e‐mail you
convinced me to write.

13:04.312 --> 13:06.043
Because I didn't know it was
gonna take you two months

13:06.067 --> 13:07.124
to write it, okay?

13:07.149 --> 13:08.440
You abandoned me.

13:08.465 --> 13:10.737
No, no, no. You abandoned me.

13:10.762 --> 13:13.472
I warned you exactly how
much rage was inside of me

13:13.497 --> 13:15.215
and what would happen if it came out.

13:15.240 --> 13:16.762
Okay? A‐And not that it mattered to you.

13:16.786 --> 13:19.769
You were with Tracy,
your supposedly casual girlfriend.

13:19.794 --> 13:22.331
Well, we were casual... a month ago.

13:22.356 --> 13:24.347
And then you were gone, Sophie was gone,

13:24.372 --> 13:26.136
so Tracy and I started hanging out,

13:26.161 --> 13:28.315
and then the next thing I knew,
I had a girlfriend.

13:28.340 --> 13:31.784
So I did the list with her,
but I wanted to do it with you!

13:32.030 --> 13:33.644
Okay, see...

13:33.796 --> 13:34.963
that right there.

13:34.988 --> 13:36.354
That's our problem.

13:36.501 --> 13:37.581
Wait, what is?

13:37.606 --> 13:39.831
It's weird, right?

13:39.856 --> 13:42.698
That I'm mad at you for
spending time with Tracy,

13:42.723 --> 13:44.690
who you're in a relationship with?

13:44.884 --> 13:46.214
I'm just your mom‐friend.

13:46.239 --> 13:48.370
Angie, you know you're more than that.

13:48.859 --> 13:50.315
Well...

13:51.789 --> 13:53.542
I probably shouldn't be.

13:56.456 --> 13:57.956
Have your summer with Tracy, okay?

13:57.981 --> 14:01.378
Do... Do the pinball bar.
Get your fake birthday sausage.

14:02.766 --> 14:05.056
I'll see you when Graham
and Sophie come back.

14:11.395 --> 14:15.483
Will, your daughter gets bigger
and more beautiful every year.

14:17.419 --> 14:18.770
_

14:18.930 --> 14:22.335
_

14:24.297 --> 14:26.517
Well, Tony,
I pulled out all the stops...

14:26.542 --> 14:29.961
full pig, fat guy swinging
fire in the backyard,

14:29.986 --> 14:31.245
and for what?

14:31.270 --> 14:33.190
Poppy didn't even show up.

14:33.311 --> 14:35.299
Well, at least you got all dolled up.

14:35.324 --> 14:36.792
You think she'll ever forgive me?

14:36.817 --> 14:39.097
Don't answer that.
I can't take another kick to the pills.

14:39.121 --> 14:41.268
♪ Happy birthday ♪

14:41.293 --> 14:43.776
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

14:43.801 --> 14:45.310
Why are they singing "Happy Birthday"?

14:45.334 --> 14:46.643
It's not your birthday.

14:46.668 --> 14:50.174
Yeah, but if we tell them it is,
we get the meal for free.

14:50.376 --> 14:53.112
It's not summer unless you're
lying to a German, right?

14:53.438 --> 14:54.846
Wait, what?

14:55.746 --> 14:56.746
Nothing.

14:56.771 --> 14:58.063
Dig in.

14:58.088 --> 14:59.151
Make a wish.

15:05.873 --> 15:06.873
Hey.

15:08.643 --> 15:11.103
I came 'cause I was at
the Bavarian sausage place.

15:11.791 --> 15:12.831
Way to rub it in!

15:12.856 --> 15:14.691
No... Sorry.

15:14.716 --> 15:17.487
The point is, I was sitting there,

15:17.512 --> 15:19.151
and I knew in my heart

15:19.176 --> 15:21.651
that should have been our
fake birthday sausage.

15:22.451 --> 15:23.635
What about Tracy?

15:23.660 --> 15:25.167
Tracy's great.

15:25.192 --> 15:27.784
Frankly, it's nice to be in
a good relationship for once.

15:27.809 --> 15:31.143
But there is some stuff I just
want to do with you.

15:31.168 --> 15:32.417
The dumb stuff.

15:32.442 --> 15:34.471
You're really good at the dumb stuff.

15:37.196 --> 15:38.721
I'm sorry that...

15:38.922 --> 15:41.745
I let an e‐mail ruin our summer.

15:42.140 --> 15:43.628
It's just...

15:44.331 --> 15:46.254
I'd be writing it, you know,
ripping him a new one,

15:46.278 --> 15:47.611
- and then...
- Yeah.

15:48.085 --> 15:50.885
I don't know. All this deeper stuff
started coming out.

15:50.910 --> 15:53.544
Like, you know, how hard
it was having a baby on my own

15:53.569 --> 15:55.737
and how, to this day,
I still half‐expect everyone in my life

15:55.738 --> 15:57.260
to just walk out on me.

15:58.472 --> 16:00.878
It's why I can't bring
myself to send it.

16:01.980 --> 16:06.065
I never want stupid Derek to
know how badly he hurt me.

16:06.928 --> 16:08.159
Ever.

16:08.184 --> 16:10.331
Angie, have you ever considered

16:10.768 --> 16:14.948
that sharing your feelings
isn't a sign of weakness?

16:16.084 --> 16:18.190
Actually, no.

16:18.537 --> 16:20.503
It's kind of your job
to tell me stuff like that.

16:22.830 --> 16:25.104
I'm just mad that Derek
somehow managed to keep us

16:25.129 --> 16:26.346
from our list.

16:26.568 --> 16:28.346
Well, I got some news for you...

16:28.549 --> 16:30.893
our kids don't get home
for a couple of hours.

16:30.918 --> 16:33.919
Are you about to suggest that we
go to Douglas' lame tiki party?

Thank you, Jane.

17:50.976 --> 17:53.186
What you did to "New
York, New York" tonight

17:53.211 --> 17:55.560
was nothing short of spectacular.

17:55.585 --> 17:57.002
I didn't expect you to cry.

17:57.027 --> 17:58.027
Mahalo.

18:05.352 --> 18:06.435
I'm gonna make this quick.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.107
I deserve an explanation.

18:08.132 --> 18:10.584
Did you really ghost me
because I asked you out?

18:10.609 --> 18:12.224
Are you from horse times?

18:12.249 --> 18:14.248
I‐I thought you were better than that.

18:14.273 --> 18:15.928
At least with me.

18:18.784 --> 18:20.159
I had a heart attack.

18:20.184 --> 18:21.392
What?

18:21.417 --> 18:22.506
What?!

18:22.849 --> 18:24.600
Oh, my Go... When?

18:24.625 --> 18:25.917
On our date.

18:25.942 --> 18:27.275
You were holding my hand,

18:27.300 --> 18:29.857
and that's probably what brought it on.

18:29.882 --> 18:32.623
That and the fact that I still
hadn't used the StairMaster

18:32.648 --> 18:34.399
from my 30th birthday.

18:34.424 --> 18:36.029
Douglas, are you okay?

18:36.326 --> 18:37.451
I'm getting there.

18:37.476 --> 18:39.053
Right now, I'm on a...

18:39.936 --> 18:41.353
plant‐based diet.

18:41.378 --> 18:43.428
For God's sakes, Douglas,
why didn't you tell me?

18:43.453 --> 18:46.138
Because I didn't want you to think
of me as a weak old man, okay?

18:46.163 --> 18:48.331
So you wanted me to think
of you as a jerk instead?

18:48.356 --> 18:51.553
A‐A lot of people already
think of me that way.

18:51.578 --> 18:54.016
See, "jerk" is kind of where I live.

18:54.041 --> 18:55.217
Look, buddy,

18:55.242 --> 18:57.054
if we're gonna do this,
you're gonna have to work on

18:57.078 --> 18:59.193
your big boy communication skills.

18:59.283 --> 19:03.209
Listen, Poppy,
under any normal circumstances,

19:03.234 --> 19:05.568
I never would have
left you on that date.

19:05.593 --> 19:07.959
I was having the time of my life.

19:08.117 --> 19:10.576
It was a great half an appetizer.

19:13.601 --> 19:16.311
Maybe if I'm lucky,
you'll ask me out again.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.803
I have a good feeling about it.

19:30.069 --> 19:31.944
Last night of summer.

19:31.969 --> 19:33.070
You know what tomorrow means.

19:33.094 --> 19:35.030
We're driving them, doing homework,

19:35.055 --> 19:36.404
julienning their vegetables.

19:36.429 --> 19:38.405
Backpacks full of exploded yogurt.

19:38.430 --> 19:39.662
Their horrified screams

19:39.687 --> 19:41.450
when they discover
their art in the garbage.

19:41.475 --> 19:42.998
Talking to parents that aren't us.

19:43.023 --> 19:46.442
Again, I've been dealing
with this the entire summer.

19:46.467 --> 19:48.051
And I did a bad job.

19:48.076 --> 19:49.529
Jack got smaller.

19:49.554 --> 19:51.056
I had a great summer.

19:52.090 --> 19:53.406
Tonight.

19:54.866 --> 19:58.023
There's just one thing
left on my list to do.

19:58.578 --> 20:00.679
Oh, my God.
Is she about to send that e‐mail?

20:00.704 --> 20:01.996
What e‐mail?

20:02.021 --> 20:03.468
Yep. I'm gonna do it.

20:03.664 --> 20:07.250
I am going to truth‐bomb my
ex and never talk to him again.

20:08.681 --> 20:10.585
Can you guys help me workshop
some subject headings?

20:11.859 --> 20:12.859
Send it.

20:12.884 --> 20:13.926
- Send it.
- Send it.

20:13.951 --> 20:16.031
Send it! Send it!

20:16.056 --> 20:18.057
Send it! Send it!

20:18.082 --> 20:20.209
Send it! Send it!

20:22.007 --> 20:23.781
- Yes!
- It's in the void.

20:24.018 --> 20:25.807
Oh, we're so proud of you, girl.

20:26.566 --> 20:27.781
That felt good.

20:27.806 --> 20:30.773
I think I might ride this wave,
like, into the new school year.

20:30.798 --> 20:32.090
You know, turn over a new leaf.

20:32.115 --> 20:34.312
Maybe date some new people,
try some new things.

20:34.337 --> 20:36.695
Like, I‐I don't know,
putting my grocery cart back!

20:36.720 --> 20:39.031
Angie, that would be huge for you.

20:39.056 --> 20:41.695
It's not gonna be easy,
but you guys will have my back.

20:41.720 --> 20:43.470
See, this is gonna be a great fall.

20:43.495 --> 20:44.913
And tomorrow, we get to go back

20:44.938 --> 20:47.398
to doing what we do best... parenting.

20:47.686 --> 20:49.664
We are pretty good at parenting,
aren't we?

20:49.689 --> 20:50.702
Best in the biz.

20:50.727 --> 20:52.083
- Mm‐hmm.
- Yeah.

20:52.108 --> 20:53.859
Uh, hello?!

20:55.243 --> 20:57.841
No one was there to pick
us up at the bus station!

20:57.866 --> 20:59.421
We had to walk home!

20:59.446 --> 21:01.321
We had to cross the freeway.

21:01.346 --> 21:03.968
It was actually kinda fun,
but that's not the point!

21:03.993 --> 21:06.695
Seriously, we leave,
and everything falls apart?

21:06.720 --> 21:08.766
What have you people
been doing without us?

21:12.148 --> 21:14.004
Surpriiiise?

21:14.029 --> 21:16.500
Surprise!
