00:36.666 --> 00:39.041
<i> Christmas is almost here.</i>

00:41.666 --> 00:46.333
<i>And after that day,</i>
<i>I know my life will never be the same.</i>

00:48.250 --> 00:50.166
<i>I'm a little scared.</i>

00:50.250 --> 00:53.916
<i>Well, to be honest, a lot scared.</i>

00:54.833 --> 00:57.916
<i>What will happen to me, to us?</i>

00:59.208 --> 01:02.041
<i>And then there's little Jacob.</i>

01:02.833 --> 01:04.916
<i>What about him?</i>

01:06.500 --> 01:08.791
<i>I just hope he'll be okay.</i>

01:40.666 --> 01:42.666
-There he is!

01:49.458 --> 01:53.208
How's everybody doing?
See you in there. Thanks for coming.

01:55.833 --> 01:59.458
In Book Five, will we finally
learn the truth about Camille?

01:59.541 --> 02:02.458
Is she part of the French Resistance
like she says?

02:02.541 --> 02:05.000
Or is she really a Nazi spy?

02:05.500 --> 02:07.666
You know, I've been going
back and forth on that one.

02:07.750 --> 02:10.833
Make her a heroine!
Oh, it's so much more romantic.

02:10.916 --> 02:13.416
-Yeah…
-Then again, a spy is sexier.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.000
Hmm! You know what?

02:15.083 --> 02:17.041
-Double agent.

02:17.125 --> 02:18.208
Oh!

02:19.041 --> 02:22.333
Could you inscribe it to Sherri, please?
I'm Sherri.

02:23.375 --> 02:24.916
So is it an "I" or a "Y"?

02:25.458 --> 02:28.000
Either is fine.

02:30.833 --> 02:34.250
You recognize me, <i>non</i>? Book Three.

02:34.333 --> 02:38.583
Of course, of course!
Camille Toussaint. How are you?

02:38.666 --> 02:40.708
Very well, sir. Very well.

02:42.291 --> 02:43.791
Merry Christmas, Camille.

02:44.750 --> 02:46.041
Thank you so much!

02:47.916 --> 02:49.750
Make it out to Todd and Mark.

02:49.833 --> 02:50.791
Sure.

02:50.875 --> 02:53.708
Oh, make that Mark and Todd.
I read the book first.

02:53.791 --> 02:56.375
No way. Don't you remember?
Your sister gave it to me.

02:56.458 --> 02:59.125
-No, your sister gave it to me--
-Tell you what, fellas.

02:59.208 --> 03:01.791
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go ahead and sign two books.

03:01.875 --> 03:04.041
One for each of you, okay?

03:04.125 --> 03:05.916
My treat. There you go.

03:07.958 --> 03:10.625
So, are you staying in the city
for the holidays?

03:10.708 --> 03:11.958
I'm afraid not.

03:12.041 --> 03:14.250
-Gotta get home to my girl, Ava.
-Oh.

03:14.333 --> 03:15.833
I didn't know that you were…

03:16.500 --> 03:18.666
Well, she's a very lucky woman.

03:19.958 --> 03:21.958
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

04:36.666 --> 04:38.958
Ava, hon, I'm home!

04:46.416 --> 04:47.250
Ava?

04:47.333 --> 04:50.166
-Come here! Come here, baby.

04:50.250 --> 04:53.250
What's up? How are you? Come here! Hi! Hi!

04:53.333 --> 04:56.041
-Welcome home, Mr. Jacob.
-Oh, thanks, Svet. Thanks.

04:56.125 --> 04:58.375
Hi, how are you? Hello!

04:58.458 --> 05:00.291
-Everything under control? Yeah?
-Mmm-hmm.

05:00.375 --> 05:03.958
-Yeah. Refrigerator is full. Ava has bath.
-Yeah. Okay.

05:04.041 --> 05:05.625
I bring in extra firewood.

05:06.333 --> 05:08.500
Oh, and, uh, fan mail.

05:08.583 --> 05:09.458
Oof.

05:09.541 --> 05:11.541
More even than last book, I think.

05:11.625 --> 05:13.333
Wow. Okay, fan mail. Look at that.

05:13.416 --> 05:15.958
Now I know what I'm doing
for the next couple weeks, right?

05:16.041 --> 05:18.375
Thank you for
holding down the fort while I was gone.

05:18.458 --> 05:21.041
-Mmm-hmm.
-Oh, I almost forgot.

05:22.125 --> 05:24.541
-This, Svetlana, is for you.
-Oh!

05:24.625 --> 05:25.833
Happy holidays.

05:25.916 --> 05:28.250
-And, you know, thank you for everything.
-Oh, thank you.

05:29.791 --> 05:31.416
You're gonna be okay, Mr. Jacob?

05:32.458 --> 05:35.291
Okay? Yeah, what do you mean?
It's me. Of course. I'm always okay.

05:36.208 --> 05:37.666
But also always alone.

05:38.458 --> 05:41.833
I'm alone because I prefer it that way,
you know that. Besides, I'm not alone.

05:41.916 --> 05:44.541
I got my best girl here, Ava.
She'll keep me company.

05:47.333 --> 05:51.500
-See you next year, Mr. Jacob.
-Yeah! See you, you know…

05:52.375 --> 05:54.208
Ava! Come here.

06:01.625 --> 06:03.500
Let's, uh, see what we got here.

06:14.333 --> 06:15.666
No.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.666
-Ah, there we go. All right.

06:19.791 --> 06:22.208
I could get down with that.
That's good. That is good.

07:07.583 --> 07:10.000
-Hello?
-<i>Hi, is this, uh, Jacob Turner?</i>

07:12.958 --> 07:14.000
Yeah, this is,

07:14.083 --> 07:17.750
but, you know, I don't need
my carpets cleaned, or a home loan, or--

07:17.833 --> 07:21.833
<i>Yeah. Uh, Mr. Turner, apologies.</i>
<i>I was, uh… hesitant to leave a message.</i>

07:21.916 --> 07:24.750
<i>My name is Matt Segreto. I'm an attorney--</i>

07:24.833 --> 07:28.000
Oh, let me guess. You have a client
who claims I stole one of their ideas.

07:28.083 --> 07:29.208
<i>No, um…</i>

07:30.750 --> 07:33.791
<i>I'm the executor of your mother's estate.</i>

07:37.791 --> 07:41.250
I'm sorry. You're, uh… What was that?

07:41.333 --> 07:45.166
<i>I really am sorry</i>
<i>to be the one to tell you. Uh…</i>

07:45.958 --> 07:47.333
<i>She passed last week.</i>

07:48.750 --> 07:49.875
<i>I thought you knew.</i>

07:51.000 --> 07:52.416
No, I… I didn't know that.

07:58.166 --> 08:00.875
My mother and I
hadn't spoken in a long time.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.541
Our relationship was, uh…

08:04.000 --> 08:05.083
complicated.

08:05.833 --> 08:07.041
<i> I understand.</i>

08:07.625 --> 08:12.291
<i>She left everything to you, um,</i>
<i>her house and all her furnishings.</i>

08:13.916 --> 08:16.125
<i>There's some paperwork</i>
<i>that needs to be signed.</i>

08:16.208 --> 08:19.791
<i>Um, I can arrange to meet you</i>
<i>in Bridgeport one day next week,</i>

08:19.875 --> 08:21.041
<i>if that's convenient.</i>

08:40.333 --> 08:41.625
-Mr. Turner.
-Hey!

08:42.291 --> 08:43.125
Matt Segreto.

08:45.333 --> 08:46.833
-Thanks for meeting me out here.
-Yeah.

08:46.916 --> 08:48.416
-I'm so sorry for your loss.
-Thank you.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.583
Place must bring back a lot of memories.

08:52.625 --> 08:53.750
You have no idea.

08:57.583 --> 08:59.041
-You just, uh…
-Yeah.

09:10.208 --> 09:11.791
-Oh!

09:11.875 --> 09:12.875
Careful.

09:15.208 --> 09:16.333
Whoa.

09:16.416 --> 09:17.416
Ugh.

09:19.083 --> 09:21.208
Yeah, neighbors said
she rarely left the house.

09:21.291 --> 09:23.375
And when they dropped by,
she never let them in.

09:23.458 --> 09:25.416
Now I know why.

09:25.500 --> 09:28.750
Should be a piano
hiding over here somewhere.

09:28.833 --> 09:34.375
Um, yep. According to the inventory,
it's a Steinway Model S, 1940.

09:34.458 --> 09:36.458
It's worth about 40 grand.

09:37.041 --> 09:37.916
Hmm.

09:38.791 --> 09:41.666
From the look of things,
you're gonna be doing a lot of trash runs.

09:41.750 --> 09:44.208
Do you want me to
get a dumpster rental for you?

09:45.375 --> 09:46.208
Huh?

09:46.708 --> 09:48.375
Oh, uh… Yeah.

09:49.291 --> 09:50.666
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.958
And, um, Mr. Turner…

09:53.541 --> 09:54.625
Jake.

09:54.708 --> 09:58.875
I hate to bother you,
but my wife is just a huge fan, and, um…

09:58.958 --> 10:01.000
Okay.

10:01.708 --> 10:03.833
You know, us Regular Joes
can never really live up

10:04.416 --> 10:06.458
to the super-suave dudes in your books.

10:07.583 --> 10:09.750
Those dudes aren't real, Matt.

10:09.833 --> 10:12.083
Yeah, tell that to my wife.

10:13.458 --> 10:15.083
Her name's Mercedes.

10:16.208 --> 10:17.208
Like the car.

10:17.291 --> 10:19.125
Right.

10:20.375 --> 10:21.541
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

11:16.833 --> 11:17.833
Come on, babe.

11:23.875 --> 11:26.166
All right, you ready? Hop on up.

11:26.750 --> 11:27.750
Good girl.

11:31.375 --> 11:33.041
Simply exquisite.

11:35.875 --> 11:37.125
Ellie, is that you?

11:37.208 --> 11:39.000
Jacob, you came!

11:39.875 --> 11:40.875
Of course.

11:40.958 --> 11:45.541
I don't know, somehow I assumed
that you'd send an assistant or someone,

11:45.625 --> 11:47.916
I guess because you're so famous now.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.750
No, some things you gotta do on your own.
So good to see you. You look great.

11:51.833 --> 11:55.291
You too. It's been a long time.
What, it's 20 years, probably?

11:55.375 --> 11:58.333
-You were about 18 when you left.
-17 when I left.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.583
That was
a really tough time for you.

12:01.666 --> 12:02.791
Yeah, it was.

12:03.625 --> 12:05.416
But, you know,
I always knew you'd be a writer.

12:06.708 --> 12:08.208
You were an interesting kid.

12:08.291 --> 12:12.208
You had a wonderful imagination,
and you loved words.

12:12.291 --> 12:17.875
I remember sitting in your den for hours,
playing online <i>Scrabble.</i>

12:17.958 --> 12:20.833
Oh, whenever your mom
had a really bad day.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.666
Mom had a lot of bad days, didn't she?

12:23.750 --> 12:25.416
She was never the same.

12:29.083 --> 12:30.208
None of us were.

12:39.083 --> 12:40.708
-They're good!

12:43.250 --> 12:45.791
-Oh, wonderful.
-That's sweet. Thank you.

12:45.875 --> 12:47.000
-Bye-bye now.
-Bye.

12:47.083 --> 12:48.208
Hey, are you still painting?

12:48.916 --> 12:51.125
You might as well
ask if I'm still breathing.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.708
Listen, I'm glad I ran into you.
It's good to see you.

12:54.791 --> 12:57.083
I'm about ready to take off. I gotta, um…

12:58.250 --> 13:00.708
I gotta come back tomorrow
and tackle another room.

13:00.791 --> 13:04.000
It's gotta be really,
really hard going through all her stuff.

13:04.708 --> 13:07.625
Yeah. What was it
that Robert Frost always said?

13:07.708 --> 13:10.541
He said, "The best way out
is always through," right?

13:10.625 --> 13:13.958
Although I'm pretty sure
he never met a hoarder.

13:14.541 --> 13:16.250
I would imagine not.

13:48.250 --> 13:49.666
It's lonely out here.

13:50.750 --> 13:51.833
And I miss you.

14:37.875 --> 14:39.250
Oh, God! Oh, come on!

14:56.125 --> 14:58.375
Oh, come on, Mom, really?

15:00.666 --> 15:02.083
-What?

15:48.708 --> 15:51.333
Still like a grilled cheese
with tomato soup?

15:52.333 --> 15:55.041
I figured you'd probably worked up
a pretty good appetite by now.

15:55.125 --> 15:56.416
You kidding? I'm starving.

15:56.500 --> 15:59.833
-Does she like tomato soup? Is this okay?
-She loves it. Yeah. Yeah, it's great.

15:59.916 --> 16:00.958
Oh, there you go.

16:03.958 --> 16:05.541
-Oh, she does!
-Look at that!

16:05.625 --> 16:07.916
We don't know how to thank you.
Do we, Ava?

16:08.875 --> 16:11.708
-You could put me in your next novel.
-Whoa, whoa, hold on a second.

16:11.791 --> 16:13.500
You actually read my novels?

16:13.583 --> 16:17.416
I'm probably the only one of your readers
who can recognize some of the characters.

16:17.500 --> 16:18.791
Like whom, for instance?

16:18.875 --> 16:21.791
-Well, in <i>Green Eyes.</i>
<i>-Green Eyes of Paris.</i>

16:21.875 --> 16:23.291
Yeah, the photographer.

16:23.375 --> 16:26.083
Beautiful, strong woman
who has a breakdown.

16:26.666 --> 16:28.791
Well, that one's pretty obvious,
though, right?

16:28.875 --> 16:33.000
There's another character I recognize,
you know, in <i>The Final Midnight.</i>

16:33.083 --> 16:34.458
The father of the soldier.

16:34.541 --> 16:37.625
Very minor character, though.
Sort of like in real life.

16:37.708 --> 16:41.125
Your memories of him can't be all that bad
if you're still wearing his watch.

16:44.208 --> 16:46.833
He came to your mother's funeral.
Did you know that?

16:48.125 --> 16:51.375
To pay his respects, but I'm pretty sure
he was hoping to see you there.

16:51.875 --> 16:53.208
No, I don't…

16:54.583 --> 16:56.625
I don't think so, no.

16:56.708 --> 16:59.000
And the funeral… the funeral, I feel…

16:59.083 --> 17:02.791
It's understandable,
but it doesn't matter anymore.

17:02.875 --> 17:04.875
That was then. This is now.

17:05.666 --> 17:06.500
Thanks.

17:07.083 --> 17:10.000
-And can I ask you a question?
-Yeah.

17:11.125 --> 17:13.125
-It's personal.
-Sure.

17:14.666 --> 17:15.500
Um…

17:16.208 --> 17:17.875
Am I too old for this?

17:19.458 --> 17:20.333
Are--

17:20.416 --> 17:22.083
-This is your question?
-Yes.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.916
No! No.

17:24.416 --> 17:26.041
-Seriously?
-This is perfect.

17:26.125 --> 17:28.875
Have you tried one of these?
Of course not. Why would you?

17:28.958 --> 17:30.750
You got women linin' up on your doorstep.

17:30.833 --> 17:33.666
I do not have women
lining up on my doorstep.

17:33.750 --> 17:36.958
I see those magazines at the supermarket.
You date movie stars.

17:37.041 --> 17:40.333
All right.
Listen, they will print anything.

17:40.416 --> 17:43.041
But the answer to your question,
no, I have not tried a dating app,

17:43.125 --> 17:44.750
but I think you absolutely should.

17:44.833 --> 17:46.083
I have to write something.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.291
-Dating profile?
-Yeah.

17:47.375 --> 17:49.208
I know a writer. May I?

17:49.291 --> 17:52.458
-You're gonna write my profile? Oh!
-It would be my pleasure.

17:53.250 --> 17:54.083
Hmm.

18:50.333 --> 18:53.250
-Come on in, Ellie. Door's open.

18:57.833 --> 18:59.583
-Hello?
-You're not Ellie.

19:00.750 --> 19:02.458
Uh, no. No, I'm not.

19:02.541 --> 19:04.375
No, it's just--
I thought you were my neighbor.

19:04.458 --> 19:06.083
Oh, sorry.

19:06.166 --> 19:07.333
You were here before, right?

19:07.416 --> 19:09.708
-You were across the street?
-Yeah. Yeah, that was me.

19:09.791 --> 19:11.708
I'm not some kind of
weird stalker or anything,

19:11.791 --> 19:13.458
if that's what you're thinking.

19:13.541 --> 19:16.750
No, I didn't think you were.
Could you close the door behind you?

19:16.833 --> 19:18.500
-Do you mind?
-Yeah, of course. Yeah, um…

19:20.250 --> 19:21.375
What can I do for you?

19:21.458 --> 19:24.083
-Hey. He's cute. Good boy.

19:24.166 --> 19:26.458
Girl, actually. That's Ava.

19:26.541 --> 19:28.416
-Cool name. Hey, Ava.

19:29.125 --> 19:30.125
Um…

19:31.000 --> 19:32.958
This is the Turner residence, right?

19:33.041 --> 19:36.291
Sort of. Sort of.
Uh, I'm Jake Turner.

19:36.375 --> 19:38.500
Great. Nice to meet you, Mr. Turner.

19:38.583 --> 19:41.250
My name's Rachel Campbell.
And the reason I'm here…

19:43.750 --> 19:47.833
Sorry, this is a little complicated,
but I'm trying to find my mother.

19:49.041 --> 19:51.708
And I think you might be able to help me.

19:52.500 --> 19:55.416
She used to live here
a long time ago, I think. I hope.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.291
Your mother lived here in this house?

19:57.375 --> 19:58.708
Yeah, um, when I was born…

19:58.791 --> 20:00.583
Rather, right before I was born,
she lived…

20:01.458 --> 20:04.458
This is Scott
and Lois Turner's house, right?

20:04.541 --> 20:08.541
Yeah. Uh, well, yeah. My parents.

20:08.625 --> 20:11.875
Great. So, yeah, my birth mother,
she lived here and she worked for them.

20:11.958 --> 20:13.375
Your mother worked for my parents?

20:13.458 --> 20:16.666
From what I can tell,
she was actually their nanny.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.458
-Um…

20:21.083 --> 20:24.250
Whoa! No! Oh, whoa, whoa! No, no, no!
Okay, hold on! Hold--

20:24.333 --> 20:25.416
Ow! That's hot.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.333
You need a hand?

20:27.416 --> 20:28.666
No, no, it's…

20:28.750 --> 20:30.375
-I got it under control.
-Okay.

20:30.458 --> 20:32.250
-Ah, forget it.
-Okay.

20:33.916 --> 20:36.625
So what brings Nancy Drew
to the Turner house, anyway?

20:36.708 --> 20:38.416
-If you don't mind me asking.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.916
It wasn't easy.
My adoption file was sealed.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.625
But a friend of mine worked
for the Connecticut Records Department.

20:43.708 --> 20:45.333
By law, he couldn't tell me my mom's name,

20:45.416 --> 20:49.041
but he could tell me
her last known address which was here, so…

20:49.541 --> 20:52.583
I understand, but I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I…

20:52.666 --> 20:55.708
I was just about ready to head out.
I wish I could help you.

20:55.791 --> 20:58.291
-I don't think I can, though.
-No, I totally understand.

20:58.375 --> 21:01.333
I guess I just gotta
learn to leave the table.

21:02.958 --> 21:04.166
Nina Simone.

21:04.250 --> 21:06.708
That's right. Yeah, she's the best.

21:07.791 --> 21:10.208
-One of your favorites?
-She is.

21:10.291 --> 21:15.500
-You got any others?
-Uh, Peggy Lee, Ella, Lady Day.

21:15.583 --> 21:17.791
-Aretha.
-Mmm. Oh, don't forget about Gladys.

21:17.875 --> 21:20.750
Oh, Gladys the Baddest. My dad…

21:21.791 --> 21:24.416
He was my own personal musicologist,
taught me everybody.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.166
Like Little Richard, Marvin Gaye.

21:26.250 --> 21:28.875
-Marvin. We lost him when I was a kid.
-'84.

21:29.416 --> 21:32.625
-Yeah. Yep.
-You in music or something?

21:32.708 --> 21:34.666
No. No, no, I'm a…

21:34.750 --> 21:37.583
-I write a little bit.
-Really? Cool! Anything I know?

21:37.666 --> 21:40.666
Uh… You know, no, probably not.

21:40.750 --> 21:44.208
-No? Anything I'd like?
-No. No, probably not.

21:44.291 --> 21:46.375
-Struggling artist? I get it.
-Ah…

21:47.500 --> 21:50.583
Well, I guess we're all struggling
in one way or another, huh?

21:50.666 --> 21:52.125
Ain't that the truth.

21:52.208 --> 21:54.291
Listen, I'm sorry
I couldn't help you with your mom.

21:54.375 --> 21:56.500
Yeah. Don't apologize.

21:57.416 --> 22:00.583
Honestly, just being in the house
where she once lived makes me feel…

22:03.166 --> 22:05.166
I don't know…
…more connected to her somehow.

22:05.250 --> 22:06.333
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

22:06.833 --> 22:09.208
Anyway, thanks.

22:11.625 --> 22:14.208
-Um, thank you. Yeah.
-Oh.

22:14.291 --> 22:16.125
Oops. Merry Christmas.

22:16.208 --> 22:17.625
-Merry Christmas to you.
-Thank you.

22:21.750 --> 22:24.416
-Wait, Ellie. Wait-- Rachel!

22:25.833 --> 22:27.000
Rachel, wait!

22:40.291 --> 22:41.458
I have an idea.

22:46.291 --> 22:49.375
Thing is, my neighbor's been living
here for years, and I was thinking she…

22:49.458 --> 22:52.000
I feel the same way.

22:54.875 --> 22:56.208
Well, that was quick.

22:58.541 --> 22:59.375
What?

22:59.458 --> 23:01.666
Uh, nothing. I'll explain later.

23:01.750 --> 23:04.125
Listen, why don't I, um,
give you my phone number?

23:04.208 --> 23:05.833
And then you can just text me tomorrow.

23:05.916 --> 23:08.583
-I'm sure I'll have spoken to her by then.
-Oh, that would be great.

23:08.666 --> 23:09.916
Actually, you know what? Um…

23:10.000 --> 23:11.750
I think I might
just wait until she's back.

23:11.833 --> 23:14.416
-I'll wait in my car.
-You sure? She might be a while.

23:14.500 --> 23:17.083
-I've come this far, so…
-Okay.

23:17.166 --> 23:18.458
-Okay.
-Yup.

23:18.541 --> 23:19.541
Thanks.

23:39.416 --> 23:40.333
-Hey.
-Hey.

23:41.625 --> 23:42.625
What's up?

23:43.375 --> 23:47.750
Are you hungry?
I was gonna grab a bite, if you're hungry.

23:48.583 --> 23:50.208
-Very cool.
-Mmm-hmm.

23:50.291 --> 23:52.333
-So is this an old haunt or…
-No.

23:52.416 --> 23:54.041
I haven't been here in years, actually,

23:54.125 --> 23:56.958
but my mom used to take me here a lot
when I was a kid.

23:57.041 --> 23:59.916
-She loved this place.
-I can see why. It's nice.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.166
-Welcome to Trattoria Toscana.
-Thank you.

24:02.250 --> 24:04.416
I am Vittorio.
May I share tonight's specials?

24:04.500 --> 24:06.083
Sure. Thank you so much.

24:06.166 --> 24:08.208
-Ah, do you speak Italian?
-Oh, yes.

24:08.291 --> 24:10.041
-Very good!

24:10.125 --> 24:12.375
For the first course,
I recommend the pumpkin tortelli.

24:12.458 --> 24:13.291
Mmm!

24:13.375 --> 24:15.666
Next, I would suggest
a nice baked sea bass.

24:15.750 --> 24:21.125
We prepare it very lightly with a drizzle
of olive oil, lemon, and rosemary.

24:21.208 --> 24:24.625
Mmm!

24:24.708 --> 24:26.541
Yes! Oh, no. No, no, no.

24:26.625 --> 24:30.666
-Uh, I'll take the pasta of the day.

24:30.750 --> 24:31.916
-Good.
-Thank you.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.958
Could you repeat in English?

24:34.041 --> 24:37.208
No, no, it's… it's fine.
I'll just have whatever she's having.

24:37.291 --> 24:39.333
-Ah.
-Oh, and a glass of wine, please.

24:39.416 --> 24:40.875
-Do you want one?
-Uh, no, no.

24:40.958 --> 24:41.916
You sure?

24:43.958 --> 24:46.333
Two glasses
of classic Chianti please.

24:46.416 --> 24:49.750
-Very good.
-Oh, uh, um… Separate checks?

24:49.833 --> 24:51.750
-Ah, but of course. Yes.
-Thank you.

24:51.833 --> 24:54.958
- What's that last thing?
-Oh, it's, um…

24:55.041 --> 24:57.041
-Separate checks. Yeah.
-Separate checks?

24:57.125 --> 24:59.500
You're a writer
and I just want to respect that.

24:59.583 --> 25:03.041
Both of my parents are artists.
They make and sell their own jewelry.

25:03.125 --> 25:05.458
So as you can imagine, it's, uh…

25:05.541 --> 25:08.125
there have been times
when the bills have been challenging.

25:08.208 --> 25:09.500
So I figure it's better to--

25:09.583 --> 25:13.083
I'm sure you can understand
and appreciate that sometimes it's--

25:13.166 --> 25:17.041
-Thank you. I appreciate it. Nice of you.
-Yeah. Yeah, of course.

25:17.625 --> 25:19.666
So you speak fluent Italian.
How'd that happen?

25:19.750 --> 25:23.291
Well, actually,
I also speak French and German.

25:24.458 --> 25:25.500
Little bit of Mandarin.

25:25.583 --> 25:27.000
-You speak a little Mandarin?
-A bit.

25:27.083 --> 25:28.250
I kid you not!

25:28.333 --> 25:30.291
No, it's…
I'm a language major, so…

25:30.375 --> 25:32.708
-Got it. Cool. You don't hear that--
<i>-Grazie.</i>

25:32.791 --> 25:34.375
Thank you very much.

25:34.458 --> 25:37.333
Um, so how do you
while away the hours these days?

25:37.416 --> 25:41.083
Actually, I just applied for a job
as a translator at the UN.

25:41.166 --> 25:43.208
-It's a long shot.
-Long shot? Why is it a long shot?

25:43.958 --> 25:45.291
Isn't everything?

25:45.375 --> 25:46.500
Mm.

25:47.916 --> 25:50.750
-Um, sorry, I should take this.
-Sure. No problem.

25:50.833 --> 25:52.166
-One second.
-Sure.

25:55.416 --> 25:58.041
I'll see you at the table, all right?
Welcome home, stranger!

25:59.416 --> 26:00.625
Dion, hey! How are you?

26:00.708 --> 26:03.333
-Man, how long has it been?
-It's been a while. 12th grade.

26:03.416 --> 26:06.333
Yeah, you disappeared.
Where did you go to college, anyway?

26:06.416 --> 26:09.708
You know, I didn't go. I ended up…
I went to Paris. School of life.

26:09.791 --> 26:11.583
Oh, that's right.
You look exactly the same.

26:12.916 --> 26:13.916
Only richer.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.083
Ah…

26:15.958 --> 26:18.208
Is it true they're turning
your new book into a movie?

26:19.375 --> 26:21.208
I don't know.
I mean, this is what they say.

26:21.291 --> 26:24.875
-Hometown hero.
-Thank you very much. You're very kind.

26:25.791 --> 26:27.708
-It's great seeing you, man.
-Good to see you.

26:31.500 --> 26:33.000
Sorry about that.

26:33.083 --> 26:35.500
-Where were we?
-We were, um…

26:36.166 --> 26:38.333
Potential job. UN. Long shot.

26:38.416 --> 26:39.500
Yeah, it's…

26:41.083 --> 26:45.083
I don't know, with this new job,
it could be challenging. I don't know.

26:45.166 --> 26:47.833
-We may have to move and it's just…
-"We"?

26:48.791 --> 26:50.416
Yeah, Alan and me.

26:50.958 --> 26:54.000
-And Alan is?
-Oh, God, sorry. Alan's my fiancé.

26:54.083 --> 26:55.166
Oh, you're engaged?

26:55.250 --> 26:56.833
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

26:56.916 --> 26:59.250
Hey, congratulations. I love love.

26:59.333 --> 27:01.916
-Great. Thank you.
-Cheers. This is wonderful.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.375
Um, we haven't set a date yet.

27:04.458 --> 27:07.958
And Alan wants to,
but if I do get this job, then…

27:10.250 --> 27:12.541
I don't-- We'll just
have to figure it out, I guess.

27:12.625 --> 27:14.333
Haven't even looked
for engagement rings yet.

27:14.416 --> 27:17.833
Well, we went last week, and I don't know,
I couldn't pick anything.

27:17.916 --> 27:20.750
So I just… we just left and then…

27:20.833 --> 27:25.083
Actually, this was kind of cute.
On the walk home, he gave me this.

27:26.791 --> 27:28.208
-What's that?
-It's…

27:31.166 --> 27:32.208
Cigar ring.

27:33.208 --> 27:35.666
Believe it or not,
this silly ring came as kind of a relief.

27:35.750 --> 27:36.958
-Yeah?
-I'm not into all that

27:37.041 --> 27:39.083
"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"
kind of stuff.

27:39.166 --> 27:44.083
The truth is I'm kind of ambivalent
about the concept of being engaged.

27:44.166 --> 27:46.208
-Mmm-hmm.
-One the one hand, I like the certainty,

27:46.291 --> 27:49.208
but on the other, it makes you feel
kind of boxed in, you know?

27:49.291 --> 27:52.958
Yeah, no, "boxed in" is something
I've managed to avoid my entire life.

27:54.250 --> 27:57.125
In my case, it's tricky 'cause
Alan likes doing things by the book.

27:57.208 --> 28:00.416
And it's important to respect
what the other person wants. Right?

28:00.500 --> 28:01.916
-Mmm-hmm.
-But he's a tax attorney!

28:02.000 --> 28:04.833
He's very, very good at his job,
and he's super precise.

28:04.916 --> 28:07.333
Believe me, he'll be the one
planning our wedding

28:07.416 --> 28:08.791
down to the very last place card.

28:08.875 --> 28:10.708
It's gonna run like clockwork.

28:10.791 --> 28:12.875
And the good thing is,
then I promise I'll shut up,

28:12.958 --> 28:15.791
but I think, I don't know,
Alan and I complement one another.

28:15.875 --> 28:18.958
And that's how it's…
It's supposed to be like that, right?

28:19.041 --> 28:22.250
I mean, I'm not an expert on the subject,
but, yeah, that sounds about right.

28:22.333 --> 28:24.000
Well, for better or worse, I am.

28:24.958 --> 28:26.958
I don't know,
I think being adopted, I'm just…

28:28.750 --> 28:31.333
I'm always trying
to fill some kind of void.

28:31.416 --> 28:34.291
I'm always looking
for security and reliability,

28:34.875 --> 28:38.625
and that's why I think if I find my real--
my birth mom, it's…

28:40.791 --> 28:44.250
I don't know, it'll resolve this
huge uncertainty in my life and then…

28:46.000 --> 28:47.833
-I don't know.
-You'll be free.

28:50.166 --> 28:51.333
-Yeah.
-Come on.

28:54.458 --> 28:57.083
Honestly, I really
would have been happy to split it.

28:57.166 --> 28:58.916
Oh, come on.
No, it was my pleasure.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.208
Good food, good company.

29:04.250 --> 29:05.083
Huh.

29:05.166 --> 29:07.083
That's a three-hour date.

29:07.166 --> 29:09.625
I guess the universe
really does reward the brave.

29:12.541 --> 29:14.791
I should probably
tackle another room.

29:14.875 --> 29:15.875
Ah.

29:17.083 --> 29:19.958
Hey, um, I was actually wondering,
do you think there's a…

29:20.750 --> 29:24.333
there's a chance your parents
kept something of my mother's?

29:25.208 --> 29:26.625
A card? A photo?

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Anything?

29:30.500 --> 29:32.333
-Yeah. Okay.
-Be careful now.

29:32.416 --> 29:34.166
-You got it? All right.
-Yeah. Okay.

29:34.250 --> 29:36.500
-Plop it right here's fine.
-Oh, God.

29:37.708 --> 29:41.375
-Is there a dead body in there?
-I'm afraid to look to be honest with you.

29:43.375 --> 29:45.000
-Hey, who played?
-Huh?

29:45.875 --> 29:48.375
Oh, my mom forced me
to take lessons when I was a kid.

29:48.458 --> 29:50.875
-At first, I pretty much hated it.
-And then?

29:50.958 --> 29:53.625
Then it made her
really happy to hear me play, so…

29:54.625 --> 29:56.041
Will you play something for me?

29:58.083 --> 29:59.958
-Play something for you? Come on. No.
-Seriously.

30:00.041 --> 30:03.041
Seriously, I wanna see if the piano
sounds as beautiful as it looks.

30:04.333 --> 30:05.166
Please?

30:06.375 --> 30:10.083
All right. It's been a while,
so I'm probably a little rusty.

30:19.875 --> 30:21.666
-Hmm.

31:49.375 --> 31:50.375
Wow.

32:51.166 --> 32:52.458
Ah! Young love.

32:56.541 --> 32:58.375
-Hi!
-So how was the date?

32:58.458 --> 32:59.958
It went well.

33:00.458 --> 33:01.333
Just well?

33:01.916 --> 33:03.125
It went very well.

33:04.000 --> 33:04.833
Hmm!

33:05.458 --> 33:06.750
This is my friend, Rachel.

33:06.833 --> 33:08.250
-Hi!
-Hi, nice to meet you.

33:08.333 --> 33:11.041
Rachel's got a question
I think maybe only you can answer<i>.</i>

33:12.416 --> 33:13.958
Of course, I remember her.

33:14.041 --> 33:17.291
She was a babysitter,
a live-in babysitter,

33:17.375 --> 33:19.041
like, you know, like an au pair.

33:19.125 --> 33:20.541
Right. Right, sure.

33:20.625 --> 33:25.833
She was very young.
Seventeen, maybe 18 at the most.

33:25.916 --> 33:29.125
She must have moved
before the baby was born.

33:29.208 --> 33:31.208
Do you remember her name or…

33:31.291 --> 33:32.958
Gosh, that's a good question.

33:33.041 --> 33:36.208
Seems like it had something
to do with Christmas,

33:36.291 --> 33:39.166
like, um, Christina or Joy.

33:39.250 --> 33:42.333
I'm drawing a blank,
but you know who would know?

33:42.416 --> 33:44.375
-Who's that?
-Your dad.

33:47.333 --> 33:49.083
Oh. Oh, no.

33:49.166 --> 33:51.208
No, I don't, um… No.

33:51.291 --> 33:53.666
Well, anyway, he lives in Vermont now.

33:53.750 --> 33:57.000
It's way up in the mountains
in a little town called Cornwall Bridge,

33:57.083 --> 33:58.916
living pretty much off the grid.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.958
How do you…
How do you know all that?

34:01.041 --> 34:04.041
When I saw him at the funeral,
we had a nice long chat.

34:04.125 --> 34:06.958
You know, I really don't think
there would be any harm in talking--

34:07.041 --> 34:08.791
"Harm in talking"? No, there will be harm.

34:08.875 --> 34:11.333
I haven't spoken to the guy in 35 years,
Ellie, come on.

34:11.416 --> 34:13.291
No, I'm aware, but--

34:13.375 --> 34:16.916
No, no, no. I'm… Excuse me.

34:21.125 --> 34:22.416
Sorry. It's, uh…

34:23.708 --> 34:25.375
-Oh, Jacob.

34:26.083 --> 34:28.083
Now you know why he stayed away so long.

34:29.291 --> 34:31.708
It would be good for him
if he could get over it.

34:41.791 --> 34:44.625
-Rachel! Rachel, wait!
-What?

34:48.291 --> 34:49.541
-Listen.
-Yeah?

34:49.625 --> 34:53.125
I know all that stuff in there
with my dad probably seemed irrational.

34:53.208 --> 34:55.833
Oh, no, Jake, please.
You don't owe me any explanation, okay?

34:55.916 --> 34:57.958
I'm just some stranger
who showed up on your doorstep.

34:58.041 --> 34:59.333
You don't owe me anything.

34:59.416 --> 35:03.791
You've already helped me, like, a lot.
So thank you. And…

35:04.791 --> 35:08.000
I really hope you have a lovely…
a lovely Christmas.

35:08.708 --> 35:09.708
You headed home?

35:11.416 --> 35:12.250
Um…

35:13.000 --> 35:15.166
No, I'm going to Cornwall Bridge.

35:16.375 --> 35:20.708
I need to know if I ever mattered to her.
Maybe you've wondered that about your dad?

35:21.875 --> 35:24.500
Truth is, if I ever saw him,
I wouldn't know what to say to him.

35:26.166 --> 35:28.333
Well, maybe if you're up for a drive,

35:29.833 --> 35:31.541
we could script a few lines.

35:35.541 --> 35:36.541
Come on.

35:44.041 --> 35:45.000
Hop on up.

35:45.833 --> 35:50.250
You're leaving!
I guess it's, uh, time to head home?

35:50.333 --> 35:53.583
Well, yes and no, actually.

35:55.166 --> 35:58.875
-How you doing? Jake Turner. Pleasure.
-Oh, Ian Page. Pleased to meet you.

35:58.958 --> 36:01.916
-I'm a big fan of your work, really.
-Oh, thank you.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.083
I told Ian that you
basically wrote my profile.

36:05.166 --> 36:08.083
Ah, well, you know,
she made me take out all the racy stuff.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.500
Well, all's I can say
is meeting Eleanor

36:10.583 --> 36:12.750
is the greatest Christmas surprise
I could ask for.

36:12.833 --> 36:13.666
Aw.

36:13.750 --> 36:17.083
Ian plays first violin
with the Hartford Symphony.

36:17.166 --> 36:18.791
Is that right? That's impressive.

36:18.875 --> 36:20.041
-That's great.
-Thanks, mate.

36:20.125 --> 36:23.250
What did you mean when you
said you were leaving, "Yes and no"?

36:23.750 --> 36:26.583
Yes, I'm leaving. No, I'm not going home.

36:26.666 --> 36:27.958
Uh, Rachel's supposed to be--

36:28.041 --> 36:29.500
-Oh, there she is. Hey.
-Hey.

36:30.083 --> 36:32.375
She's convinced me-- And you, uh…

36:33.541 --> 36:35.083
I'm gonna go see my dad.

36:35.666 --> 36:36.500
Jacob.

36:37.416 --> 36:38.791
Good for you.

36:38.875 --> 36:42.250
Well, the universe
rewards the brave, right?

36:45.875 --> 36:46.708
You ready for this?

36:47.541 --> 36:49.541
Absolutely not. You?

36:50.458 --> 36:51.416
No.

36:52.083 --> 36:52.958
Let's go.

37:05.125 --> 37:06.916
Don't you think
Waze would be easier?

37:07.000 --> 37:10.708
Yeah, of course it would.
But maps are so much nicer, it's like a…

37:10.791 --> 37:13.208
tactile thing in a virtual world,
you know?

37:13.291 --> 37:17.416
Yeah, I know. I had this idea…
I had this idea for a book about that.

37:17.500 --> 37:20.208
-A Stephen King thriller-type thing.
-Yeah?

37:20.291 --> 37:23.750
Yeah, yeah, so here's what I came up with.
There's this couple, right?

37:23.833 --> 37:25.250
-They're on their honeymoon.
-Okay.

37:25.333 --> 37:27.000
And they're in a rental car.

37:27.083 --> 37:31.416
The GPS is, like, possessed or something,
or maybe the ex-boyfriend hacked into it.

37:32.416 --> 37:34.583
That might be better, I'm not sure.
Anyway.

37:34.666 --> 37:37.500
Whatever the case,
the GPS leads them into mortal danger.

37:39.541 --> 37:41.916
You hate it. Bad? It's bad.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.208
No, no, no!
You know, I like it. I like it.

37:44.791 --> 37:46.958
But what happens next?

37:47.041 --> 37:49.500
I mean, like,
after they're in mortal danger.

37:49.583 --> 37:51.833
Yeah, I don't-- That's as far as I got.
Never wrote it.

37:51.916 --> 37:53.500
-All right.
-That's it.

37:53.583 --> 37:56.083
Well, as my dad said,
"No creative idea's ever wasted."

37:56.166 --> 37:57.791
-So there you go.
-I like that.

37:57.875 --> 38:00.958
Okay, in three miles,
take I-91 North.

38:01.041 --> 38:02.750
-91 North. You got it.
-Yup.

38:03.500 --> 38:06.333
Alan always gets kind of
annoyed when I give him directions.

38:06.416 --> 38:08.625
-Really?
-He says he doesn't need a co-pilot.

38:08.708 --> 38:10.458
I could use
any navigational help I can get.

38:11.833 --> 38:13.666
Speaking of Alan,

38:13.750 --> 38:17.666
what's he think about this, um,
this job you applied for in New York?

38:17.750 --> 38:19.166
Um, actually, I, uh…

38:19.250 --> 38:21.666
He doesn't…
I haven't told him about it yet.

38:22.500 --> 38:24.458
What's he think
about this trip to Cornwall Bridge?

38:24.541 --> 38:26.791
Uh, he's not thrilled. He's not thrilled.

38:26.875 --> 38:29.708
And actually he was kind of… peeved.

38:31.541 --> 38:33.791
Yeah. No, let me guess, it's, uh…

38:33.875 --> 38:36.750
He's upset that you are taking
a road trip with this guy you just met?

38:36.833 --> 38:40.166
No, actually. No, it was, um…

38:42.166 --> 38:44.875
It was about the… the gas money.

38:46.041 --> 38:48.125
No, it's just like
one of those little Alan quirks.

38:48.208 --> 38:49.291
Okay.

38:49.375 --> 38:53.208
It's no big deal, and in the grand scheme
of things, it's meaningless, right?

38:53.291 --> 38:56.750
I'm kind of insulted.
He's not concerned about me, right?

38:56.833 --> 38:59.333
-He's concerned about gas money.
-Well, he doesn't know about you.

39:01.625 --> 39:02.625
Oh.

39:03.958 --> 39:06.416
As it turns out,
I didn't really know about you either.

39:06.500 --> 39:09.166
-What are you talking about?
-I finally broke down and I Googled you.

39:09.250 --> 39:12.125
-Oh, come on.
-And, honestly, I tried to put it off.

39:12.208 --> 39:14.083
Because I really don't like
looking people up.

39:14.166 --> 39:15.916
It always seems
like an intrusion, somehow.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.791
-Uh-huh.
-But now… I'm really glad I did.

39:18.875 --> 39:20.541
-No.
-'Cause now I know you're this,

39:20.625 --> 39:23.708
like, super-famous,
best-selling novelist, so…

39:23.791 --> 39:25.833
Uh, super famous
is a bit of a stretch, I think.

39:25.916 --> 39:28.125
Well, um, five million copies sold--

39:28.208 --> 39:31.000
It's like five and a half at this point,
but it's okay, who's counting?

39:31.083 --> 39:33.166
And number one
on <i>The New York Times </i>Best Seller List.

39:33.250 --> 39:37.000
-I got lucky.
-And, uh, translated into 30 languages.

39:37.083 --> 39:40.083
-I think that makes you super famous.
-Oh.

39:42.666 --> 39:46.166
Here was little old me worried
about how you were gonna pay for dinner.

39:52.500 --> 39:56.333
Hey, do you mind grabbing my wallet?
It's in the backpack in the back there.

39:56.416 --> 39:57.416
Sure.

40:00.750 --> 40:01.750
Oh!

40:05.875 --> 40:07.250
-Thank you very much.
-Mmm-hmm.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.333
-Jake, do you know what this is?

40:34.416 --> 40:36.250
No. You know what? I just, uh…

40:36.333 --> 40:38.291
That was in a box
marked "personal" at my mom's.

40:38.375 --> 40:41.625
I just kinda picked it up,
and I didn't look at it. What is it?

40:43.625 --> 40:45.916
Okay, listen to this.

40:48.416 --> 40:49.916
"My name is Noel Ellis."

40:51.500 --> 40:54.000
<i>"I'm 17 years old, and I'm having a baby."</i>

40:56.125 --> 40:57.666
This is my mother's diary.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.000
I know it.

41:00.541 --> 41:01.500
I know it.

41:02.958 --> 41:06.291
Her name is Noel. I can't believe this.

41:06.375 --> 41:09.625
I can't--
I just-- I can't--

41:12.333 --> 41:14.833
"My parents sent me away to have my baby."

41:15.625 --> 41:16.875
"They're ashamed of me."

41:16.958 --> 41:20.083
<i>And they're ashamed</i>
<i>of the child I'm bringing into this world.</i>

41:20.666 --> 41:22.500
<i>And so, I'm leaving.</i>

41:22.583 --> 41:26.291
"They truly believe it's wrong for a woman
to have a child outside of marriage."

41:27.291 --> 41:29.000
"'God disapproves,' they say."

41:29.583 --> 41:32.416
<i>But doesn't God</i>
<i>forgive our mistakes?</i>

41:35.375 --> 41:38.250
<i>Everyone I know and trust</i>
<i>has abandoned me.</i>

41:41.708 --> 41:44.791
"Thankfully, this really kind family
hired me as their nanny."

41:45.791 --> 41:48.166
<i> The Turners are a family of four.</i>

41:49.125 --> 41:53.833
<i>"Scott and Lois and</i>
<i>their little boys, Benjamin and Jacob."</i>

41:58.291 --> 42:01.125
<i>Benji's seven</i>
<i>and has loads of energy.</i>

42:02.625 --> 42:06.083
<i>Jake is four, and he's the quiet one.</i>

42:06.666 --> 42:10.666
Do you have any memory of that?
I know you were little, but…

42:11.708 --> 42:12.666
I really don't.

42:13.500 --> 42:16.625
<i>He likes me to read</i>
<i>the </i>Magic Tree House<i> books to him.</i>

42:19.500 --> 42:21.291
So where's Ben now?

42:25.875 --> 42:28.166
Oh, there was this, um,

42:29.458 --> 42:31.625
snowstorm. It was around Christmas.

42:32.125 --> 42:32.958
We had…

42:33.458 --> 42:35.791
We had this giant elm tree
in our front yard.

42:35.875 --> 42:39.333
Benji loved to climb
and he was in that tree all the time.

42:40.833 --> 42:42.291
And that night,

42:42.375 --> 42:45.916
Ben decided he was gonna climb
as high as he could in that tree.

42:46.583 --> 42:48.416
And hang his favorite ornament…

43:40.000 --> 43:42.750
Sorry about earlier, I got so emotional
talking about my brother.

43:42.833 --> 43:43.833
No, it's…

43:43.916 --> 43:46.333
You don't need to apologize. I understand.

43:46.916 --> 43:47.833
Thanks.

43:48.458 --> 43:51.541
It's been over 30 years, you know?
You'd think I'd be able to…

43:52.375 --> 43:53.333
talk about it.

43:54.375 --> 43:57.250
You know that saying,
"Time heals all wounds"?

43:57.333 --> 43:58.583
Mmm.

44:01.375 --> 44:02.500
It doesn't.

44:09.541 --> 44:11.958
<i> It's been two months now,</i>

44:12.041 --> 44:17.208
<i>and I still haven't heard a word</i>
<i>from either of my parents or Peter.</i>

44:17.291 --> 44:20.000
<i>"One day in my room,</i>
<i>I just couldn't stop crying…"</i>

44:20.083 --> 44:23.000
<i>And there was</i>
<i>this quiet knock on the door.</i>

44:23.083 --> 44:24.916
"And little Jacob came in."

44:26.250 --> 44:30.625
<i> He laid his head on my shoulder,</i>
<i>and it was as if he understood.</i>

44:32.875 --> 44:35.541
<i>I love that kid more and more every day.</i>

44:42.458 --> 44:46.250
<i>I know you're not supposed</i>
<i>to have favorites, but…</i>

44:47.083 --> 44:48.916
One New York, rare,

44:49.500 --> 44:53.416
and one vegetarian plate, no peppers,
no carrots, no onions, sauce on the side.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.583
Thank you. Perfect.

44:57.250 --> 44:59.375
-Hey, can I ask you a question?
-Can I stop you?

44:59.458 --> 45:00.625
-No.

45:01.708 --> 45:05.625
Why is it that a handsome,
successful guy like you is still single?

45:05.708 --> 45:07.708
-Handsome?
-Don't deflect.

45:08.750 --> 45:09.583
Uh…

45:10.791 --> 45:14.333
-I like to be alone, I guess, you know?
-Hmm. Safer that way. I get it.

45:16.166 --> 45:17.375
But you're engaged.

45:17.458 --> 45:20.583
Still, there's always that,
like, push-pull thing, you know?

45:20.666 --> 45:21.875
-Mmm.
-"Come closer."

45:21.958 --> 45:24.416
-"I want to be alone." You know?
-Mmm-hmm.

45:24.500 --> 45:27.708
I mean, I've had relationships
in the past, don't get me wrong.

45:27.791 --> 45:30.666
I've had serious relationships
in the past, a few of them anyway, but…

45:31.166 --> 45:33.166
You know, in the end, they all just, uh…

45:37.500 --> 45:41.208
In the end, I just wasn't
what they were looking for, you know?

45:42.958 --> 45:44.958
Maybe they weren't
what you were looking for.

45:49.458 --> 45:50.666
Uh, question.

45:50.750 --> 45:53.458
What are the odds of us making it
through the pass before the storm hits?

45:53.541 --> 45:54.916
-Tonight?
-Yeah.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.125
Ooh, I'd say about…

45:58.333 --> 45:59.208
zero.

45:59.291 --> 46:01.000
-Percent?
-Percent.

46:07.416 --> 46:10.333
Why don't you check us in?
I think Ava needs to stretch her legs.

46:10.416 --> 46:12.000
-Sure! Meet you back here in 20?
-Yeah.

46:12.083 --> 46:13.041
All right.

46:20.958 --> 46:21.958
Hey!

46:22.041 --> 46:23.458
<i>Hey, stranger.</i>

46:23.541 --> 46:26.500
<i>Look, I, uh, I wanted</i>
<i>to apologize for the other night.</i>

46:26.583 --> 46:29.166
<i>I know this stuff with your mom,</i>
<i>trying to find her--</i>

46:29.250 --> 46:31.666
No, no, no, Alan. Don't worry.
Don't worry. It's fine.

46:31.750 --> 46:35.833
<i>Uh, so, listen,</i>
<i>on a forward-thinking note,</i>

46:35.916 --> 46:38.333
<i>I had an idea for our engagement party.</i>

46:38.416 --> 46:40.125
Yeah?

46:40.208 --> 46:43.583
<i>Yeah, you know that Mexican restaurant</i>
<i>you love, Casa Frida?</i>

46:43.666 --> 46:47.208
-Uh-huh.
<i>-So it's available Valentine's Day,</i>

46:47.291 --> 46:49.666
<i>which is perfect</i>
<i>for an engagement party, right?</i>

46:49.750 --> 46:52.208
<i>Plus, they are giving us</i>
<i>a phenomenal price.</i>

46:52.291 --> 46:53.500
Oh, that sounds great.

46:55.166 --> 46:56.000
<i>Yeah?</i>

46:56.083 --> 46:59.291
<i>So my plan is give them a deposit</i>
<i>first thing tomorrow morning.</i>

47:00.833 --> 47:02.333
Alan, can we just…

47:03.500 --> 47:05.333
Can we just wait on Casa Frida?

47:06.375 --> 47:07.583
Till I get back.

47:07.666 --> 47:10.291
<i>Of course, babe. Yeah. Whatever you want.</i>

47:10.375 --> 47:11.208
<i>Um…</i>

47:11.916 --> 47:13.958
<i>-When are you back?</i>
-Soon.

47:15.375 --> 47:17.958
<i>Okay. Love you.</i>

47:18.958 --> 47:19.916
I love you too.

47:27.750 --> 47:30.041
You're in luck! Got two rooms left.

47:30.625 --> 47:31.750
Great! Terrific.

47:31.833 --> 47:34.375
You know, if this were a rom-com,
you'd have one room left.

47:34.458 --> 47:35.583
We'd have to share it.

47:36.333 --> 47:37.500
Rom-com?

47:37.583 --> 47:39.166
Romantic comedy, rom-com.

47:39.750 --> 47:41.875
-Oh, right!
-Yeah.

47:41.958 --> 47:43.833
Well, if it helps,

47:44.500 --> 47:45.708
the rooms are connected.

47:54.375 --> 47:56.000
Okay, I'm sorry, you're closing.

47:56.083 --> 47:58.541
I was gonna head to the pageant,
but it can wait.

47:58.625 --> 47:59.708
How can I help?

47:59.791 --> 48:02.416
I was wondering
if you had any books by Jacob Turner?

48:02.500 --> 48:05.458
Of course!
How far along are you in the series?

48:05.958 --> 48:08.958
Uh… I'm at the beginning, so I don't know.

48:09.041 --> 48:12.583
Okay! You want Book One,
<i>Green Eyes of Paris. </i>We should have that.

48:12.666 --> 48:15.125
Great! So what's it about?

48:15.208 --> 48:16.916
Paris in the '40s.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.250
The French Resistance,
espionage, forbidden love.

48:20.333 --> 48:22.375
Oh, wow. Sounds pretty--

48:22.458 --> 48:25.125
Riveting, right? And trust me, it is.

48:25.208 --> 48:26.583
The world this guy creates,

48:26.666 --> 48:29.666
it's like you're actually there
with his characters.

48:29.750 --> 48:31.500
It's what makes the book so absorbing.

48:31.583 --> 48:33.500
That's probably why I have
such a hard time

48:33.583 --> 48:35.000
keeping them on the shelves.

48:35.083 --> 48:37.916
Ah! Look at that, you're in luck.

48:38.791 --> 48:39.833
Thanks.

48:44.125 --> 48:45.000
Not bad.

48:45.083 --> 48:47.833
Yeah, and he writes
almost as good as he looks.

48:51.166 --> 48:52.333
-Hey.
-Hey.

48:52.416 --> 48:55.083
So, what do you think?
Should we call it a night, or…

48:56.500 --> 48:58.916
"Or." Definitely "or."

49:00.166 --> 49:02.208
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, come on.

49:07.083 --> 49:08.708
Merry Christmas!

49:09.500 --> 49:11.041
-There you are.
-Thank you.

49:21.208 --> 49:24.958
-Look at this.
-Look at this! Hi! So cute.

49:25.041 --> 49:27.375
You better knock it off.
She'll get jealous.

49:30.875 --> 49:32.583
-Incredible.
-I love it here.

49:32.666 --> 49:33.916
-How are you?
-Hi!

49:34.000 --> 49:35.791
-Do you mind if we have…
-Absolutely.

49:35.875 --> 49:38.291
-Thank you! You're giving these away?
-On the house.

49:38.375 --> 49:39.833
-Thank you!
-It's my favorite town.

49:39.916 --> 49:41.791
-Smells great.
-Happy holidays.

49:41.875 --> 49:44.916
Oh, wow, look at that!
I haven't seen this film in years.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.875
-I've never seen it.
-You're kidding. You're in for a treat.

49:51.750 --> 49:53.708
Excuse me, are you two together?

49:53.791 --> 49:54.875
Oh, no.

49:55.416 --> 49:57.708
Yeah? Well, yeah. We were, you know--

49:57.791 --> 49:58.833
Maybe we are.

49:59.625 --> 50:01.083
-Smooth.

50:02.958 --> 50:03.791
You okay?

50:03.875 --> 50:07.083
<i>I'm shakin' the dust of this</i>
<i>crummy little town off my feet</i>

50:07.166 --> 50:08.750
<i>and I'm gonna see the world!</i>

50:08.833 --> 50:11.250
<i>-Italy, Greece…</i>

50:26.125 --> 50:29.958
Wow! That may be
the best movie I've ever seen.

50:39.041 --> 50:44.416
<i>He wondered if this journey</i>
<i>was about to take an unexpected turn.</i>

50:47.000 --> 50:49.500
Oh, my God. No way.

50:58.291 --> 50:59.791
Everything okay in there?

51:01.458 --> 51:02.541
-Hi.
Hi.

51:03.541 --> 51:04.541
Yeah, I'm fine.

51:05.958 --> 51:07.000
Great.

51:09.750 --> 51:12.333
-I just-- I heard-- I thought I heard a--
-Oh, yeah, no.

51:12.416 --> 51:15.250
Thanks for checking, though.
Appreciate it.

51:15.333 --> 51:18.166
Okay. Just, uh--
Well, just have a--

51:18.250 --> 51:19.625
-Good night.
-Good night.

51:29.166 --> 51:30.750
No way!

51:50.666 --> 51:51.791
Oh!

52:13.041 --> 52:14.208
How'd you sleep?

52:14.291 --> 52:15.416
Um…

52:16.000 --> 52:18.750
Actually,
I was up last night reading.

52:19.250 --> 52:21.541
-Anything interesting?
-Uh, yeah, very.

52:22.458 --> 52:24.625
-Yeah?
-<i>Green Eyes of Paris.</i>

52:24.708 --> 52:27.375
-You know that one?
-I've heard of it. You…

52:27.458 --> 52:29.791
You bought my book
and you didn't tell me?

52:29.875 --> 52:31.125
Yeah, well, I didn't…

52:31.208 --> 52:34.500
-I didn't wanna tell you just in case--
-Just in case what?

52:35.583 --> 52:37.125
In case I didn't like it.

52:37.750 --> 52:39.750
-In case you didn't like it?
-Yeah.

52:40.333 --> 52:41.250
And?

52:42.875 --> 52:43.875
Well…

52:44.708 --> 52:47.208
No, it's okay. You can tell me. It's fine.
My ego is, uh…

52:47.291 --> 52:48.833
I think I can handle it.

52:48.916 --> 52:51.583
-What's up? What did you think?
-Okay, well, um…

52:53.125 --> 52:55.708
-You know, I find it interesting…
-Yeah.

52:55.791 --> 53:01.916
…that you write these novels
filled with suspense, and drama, romance,

53:02.000 --> 53:04.125
and yet your main character, Henri,

53:04.208 --> 53:06.583
he never lets anyone get close to him.

53:07.708 --> 53:09.833
It's kinda like what we were
talking about last night.

53:10.583 --> 53:14.666
Henri lives in occupied France, right?
He can't trust anybody.

53:15.875 --> 53:17.083
Well, yeah, but…

53:21.250 --> 53:24.208
This isn't occupied America.
So what's your excuse?

53:28.500 --> 53:29.583
On the other hand…

53:30.458 --> 53:31.291
um…

53:32.375 --> 53:34.375
-I really loved the book.
-Yeah?

53:35.000 --> 53:36.666
I loved it! It was just…

53:37.291 --> 53:38.375
God, the ending?

53:39.125 --> 53:40.000
That was…

53:42.000 --> 53:43.458
It kind of blew me away.

53:44.208 --> 53:46.125
Good. Good, good, good.

53:46.208 --> 53:48.791
The endings are, uh… ending, it's…

53:48.875 --> 53:51.458
They're always hard to get right,
you know. Yeah.

53:52.166 --> 53:56.083
Any thoughts on the current story?
You gonna get that ending right?

54:07.625 --> 54:11.166
<i>I found out today</i>
<i>I'm having a girl,</i>

54:11.833 --> 54:14.041
<i>a sweet, little baby girl.</i>

54:14.916 --> 54:18.583
<i>Before I left home, my parents</i>
<i>told me not to name my baby.</i>

54:19.708 --> 54:22.666
"Because it would
only make it harder to say goodbye."

54:22.750 --> 54:25.375
"But I've already… given her a name."

54:31.500 --> 54:32.625
<i>My angel.</i>

54:37.583 --> 54:41.291
Um, can you pull over? I… I need…
I need some air.

54:41.375 --> 54:43.333
-You sure? It's freezing outside.
-Yeah, please.

54:43.416 --> 54:44.583
Okay. Sure.

54:57.666 --> 54:59.458
Hey. Come on.

55:00.583 --> 55:03.125
Ah! It's freezing out here. Here you go.

55:03.791 --> 55:04.791
You all right?

55:09.750 --> 55:11.750
Why would she leave it behind?

55:13.708 --> 55:16.125
Why go through the trouble
of writing everything down

55:16.208 --> 55:18.375
and documenting all these details
if she wasn't…

55:18.875 --> 55:20.583
if she was just gonna abandon it?

55:22.125 --> 55:22.958
I don't know.

55:23.041 --> 55:26.083
You know, maybe she thought it would
find its way back to you, eventually?

55:26.791 --> 55:29.125
Or maybe she just
wanted to forget everything.

55:30.125 --> 55:31.583
Like it never existed.

55:33.333 --> 55:35.208
-Like I never existed.
-No.

55:44.458 --> 55:48.125
I'm supposed to be engaged.
I'm supposed to be getting married.

55:57.291 --> 56:00.166
-Oh, no! What are you-- No, wait!

56:00.250 --> 56:01.875
-Come on! where are you-- No!
-Ava? Ava!

56:02.541 --> 56:04.083
-Ava!

56:04.166 --> 56:05.208
Ava, no!

56:05.291 --> 56:08.458
Ava Turner,
get back here right now!

56:18.625 --> 56:20.958
-What were you gonna do if you caught it?
-Yeah.

56:22.375 --> 56:24.208
That was incredible.

56:29.250 --> 56:31.666
Guess life's all about the chase,
huh, Turner?

57:01.000 --> 57:03.208
-I think we took a wrong turn.

57:03.291 --> 57:06.291
-You mean you hope we took a wrong turn?
-Exactly.

57:24.458 --> 57:27.291
Please tell me
the universe really does reward the brave.

57:27.916 --> 57:28.916
You got this.

57:32.291 --> 57:33.791
Here we go.

58:11.166 --> 58:13.833
<i>It was a day</i>
<i>he had both been anticipating…</i>

58:16.333 --> 58:17.541
<i>and dreading.</i>

59:29.541 --> 59:30.541
Jacob.

59:35.083 --> 59:37.708
You know, Eleanor called
to say you might be coming.

59:38.375 --> 59:40.333
I told her I didn't believe it,

59:40.416 --> 59:43.708
but she said over and over again,
"Just be prepared."

59:45.000 --> 59:46.041
Are you?

59:48.458 --> 59:49.458
Yeah! I…

59:50.416 --> 59:52.666
I'm cutting down
this Christmas tree for you.

59:53.666 --> 59:57.291
I've only been waiting for this moment
for 30-odd years, and now that it's here…

1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:02.875
Yeah.

1:00:03.750 --> 1:00:04.666
Same.

1:00:15.416 --> 1:00:16.791
Mind giving me a hand?

1:00:19.375 --> 1:00:24.291
Plus, if it's just you,
what's the point, right?

1:00:24.375 --> 1:00:28.041
Yeah, well, if it's any
consolation, I've never had a tree,

1:00:28.125 --> 1:00:29.500
so you're ahead of me.

1:00:31.583 --> 1:00:34.458
All right.
Welcome to my humble abode.

1:00:35.583 --> 1:00:36.750
Here we go.

1:00:38.500 --> 1:00:40.958
-Now just set this end down here.
-Yeah.

1:00:41.041 --> 1:00:42.458
Can you tip it up?

1:00:43.250 --> 1:00:45.208
-Gotta get the stand.
-All right.

1:00:47.375 --> 1:00:49.833
-You live out here all alone?
-I do!

1:00:53.166 --> 1:00:55.416
-All right.
-Ellie painted that, right?

1:00:57.500 --> 1:00:59.500
Good eye. Yeah, that's hers.

1:01:01.041 --> 1:01:02.125
All right.

1:01:03.708 --> 1:01:05.750
-I think that should do it.
-Yeah?

1:01:06.916 --> 1:01:08.541
-Look at that.
-Good job.

1:01:08.625 --> 1:01:11.166
-Oh. Excuse me.

1:01:14.125 --> 1:01:15.958
Scott Turner. Hello?

1:01:18.208 --> 1:01:19.125
Yes.

1:01:38.041 --> 1:01:39.208
See you then.

1:01:40.708 --> 1:01:42.041
Sorry about that.

1:01:42.791 --> 1:01:45.333
That was, uh, one of my clients.

1:01:46.333 --> 1:01:50.208
-Your clients? What do you do?
-I'm a social worker at the VA.

1:01:50.291 --> 1:01:52.541
Social, you're trying
to do some good in the world?

1:01:54.291 --> 1:01:55.416
Underline "trying."

1:01:57.458 --> 1:02:01.416
You know, I bought these
forever ago when I first moved in,

1:02:01.500 --> 1:02:04.083
and I never even took them out of the box.

1:02:04.791 --> 1:02:06.291
Think they still work?

1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:09.083
I don't know.

1:02:12.291 --> 1:02:13.333
Jake…

1:02:16.041 --> 1:02:18.541
I know an apology doesn't mean
a whole lot after all these years…

1:02:18.625 --> 1:02:19.750
You know what? It's…

1:02:20.916 --> 1:02:21.875
You can save it.

1:02:21.958 --> 1:02:25.500
I didn't come out here for a, uh,
you know, reconciliation.

1:02:25.583 --> 1:02:28.333
I'm only here to help a friend, honestly.

1:02:29.375 --> 1:02:32.666
-A friend?
-Yeah, a friend. It's a long story.

1:02:33.916 --> 1:02:38.458
Well, since you're here, can I at least
say what I've been waiting--

1:02:38.541 --> 1:02:41.291
I'd, I'd… I'd really rather you didn't.

1:02:41.875 --> 1:02:42.875
I am sorry.

1:02:48.416 --> 1:02:50.625
You're sorry.

1:02:50.708 --> 1:02:53.791
I am deeply, deeply sorry.

1:02:59.916 --> 1:03:01.208
Yeah. Good.

1:03:01.916 --> 1:03:03.375
Good. So we're all set then.

1:03:03.458 --> 1:03:04.833
You know, um,

1:03:05.625 --> 1:03:07.083
you left me alone with Mom,

1:03:07.166 --> 1:03:10.833
and then you run up here,
and you just disappear altogether…

1:03:10.916 --> 1:03:12.500
And you're sorry?

1:03:14.833 --> 1:03:18.166
God! I said I wasn't gonna do this.

1:03:18.750 --> 1:03:22.000
Uh, you know what?
This was a mistake. I can't do this.

1:03:22.083 --> 1:03:23.958
-Jake!
-Enjoy your tree.

1:03:29.375 --> 1:03:30.541
-Hey!
-No, I can't handle this.

1:03:30.625 --> 1:03:32.541
-I thought this was a good idea. Let's go.
-What?

1:03:32.625 --> 1:03:34.875
Wait, just take a breath, okay?
Take a breath.

1:03:35.375 --> 1:03:38.125
You know, if you walk away now,
that's it, right?

1:03:38.208 --> 1:03:39.541
It's over. Forever.

1:03:39.625 --> 1:03:42.708
-Well, it's been over for 35 years--
-Stop! Jake.

1:03:44.500 --> 1:03:45.541
If you leave now,

1:03:46.916 --> 1:03:48.875
you are doing exactly what he did.

1:03:49.875 --> 1:03:50.708
Right?

1:03:53.166 --> 1:03:57.166
Why don't you just try being the first
adult in your family not to take the exit?

1:04:02.625 --> 1:04:03.458
Please.

1:04:12.625 --> 1:04:16.208
Jake,
it's just so hard to talk about…

1:04:19.291 --> 1:04:21.541
but two days before Christmas,

1:04:22.250 --> 1:04:24.791
we had the biggest snowstorm
of the winter.

1:04:27.625 --> 1:04:30.125
<i>And Benji, like every year,</i>

1:04:30.208 --> 1:04:32.875
<i>couldn't wait</i>
<i>to hang his favorite ornament</i>

1:04:32.958 --> 1:04:35.250
<i>high up in the branches</i>
<i>of our old elm tree.</i>

1:04:38.041 --> 1:04:42.166
<i>He'd climbed up so many times to</i>
<i>that platform that I'd built for you guys.</i>

1:04:48.833 --> 1:04:50.083
-Oh!

1:04:55.208 --> 1:04:57.791
<i>I knew the branches</i>
<i>could be slippery…</i>

1:05:00.916 --> 1:05:03.500
<i>but he was such a determined little guy.</i>

1:05:06.916 --> 1:05:09.916
<i>I thought,</i>
<i>"I'll just let him hang the ornament."</i>

1:05:13.583 --> 1:05:17.541
<i>The sound of that branch</i>
<i>cracking will never leave me.</i>

1:05:25.291 --> 1:05:26.666
<i>I was Benji's father.</i>

1:05:28.708 --> 1:05:30.291
<i>I should have stopped him.</i>

1:05:33.791 --> 1:05:35.000
The following April,

1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:37.583
<i>I cut down that tree.</i>

1:05:40.333 --> 1:05:41.916
It didn't help at all.

1:05:45.083 --> 1:05:46.916
And after Noel left,

1:05:48.208 --> 1:05:49.416
your mom and I just…

1:05:51.333 --> 1:05:53.166
couldn't comfort each other anymore.

1:05:55.250 --> 1:05:57.875
And it got to the point
where one of us had to leave.

1:06:00.166 --> 1:06:01.958
I wanted to take you with me,

1:06:03.208 --> 1:06:04.958
but I just couldn't do that to her.

1:06:05.458 --> 1:06:06.958
You were all she had left.

1:06:08.958 --> 1:06:12.625
I told myself that with you there,

1:06:14.708 --> 1:06:16.666
somehow she'd find her way back.

1:06:35.708 --> 1:06:39.125
You know, you used to love
stringing the lights when you were little.

1:06:40.458 --> 1:06:41.791
You remember?

1:06:51.583 --> 1:06:53.458
So, tell me, be honest,

1:06:55.458 --> 1:06:57.875
do you think we should go in
or just let them be?

1:07:05.375 --> 1:07:09.166
Okay, I guess we'll let them be.
Okay. I heard you.

1:07:13.250 --> 1:07:16.125
You know, I tried to stay in touch.

1:07:16.708 --> 1:07:21.208
At first, I called. Left messages for you.
For years, I wrote letters to you.

1:07:21.291 --> 1:07:24.625
I've never seen a letter or a message.
Mom never told me.

1:07:27.500 --> 1:07:31.458
-So are you married?
-Married? No, I'm not. No.

1:07:32.250 --> 1:07:34.000
I read your first couple of books.

1:07:34.083 --> 1:07:37.250
But my eyesight's not what it was,
so I listened to the third one on audio.

1:07:37.333 --> 1:07:40.083
I mean, it's the first time
I got to hear your adult voice.

1:07:40.166 --> 1:07:41.166
It was fantastic.

1:07:43.291 --> 1:07:44.625
I love 'em.

1:07:44.708 --> 1:07:46.166
Oh, I remember.

1:07:46.250 --> 1:07:49.083
I think Benji called you a butterfingers…

1:08:01.916 --> 1:08:03.166
That's beautiful.

1:08:04.166 --> 1:08:05.166
Here's hoping.

1:08:15.541 --> 1:08:17.750
-There you go.

1:08:24.416 --> 1:08:26.208
-Success!

1:08:27.166 --> 1:08:29.791
Didn't you say
you came here to help a friend?

1:08:36.500 --> 1:08:38.083
Hey. How's the weather?

1:08:38.750 --> 1:08:40.083
It's chili!

1:08:41.458 --> 1:08:42.416
Here it comes.

1:08:42.916 --> 1:08:46.125
-Excuse me, girl. This is not for you.

1:08:46.875 --> 1:08:48.416
Noel was a godsend.

1:08:49.958 --> 1:08:51.833
After we lost Jacob's brother,

1:08:51.916 --> 1:08:55.166
she was the glue that kept us
from completely coming apart.

1:08:55.666 --> 1:08:57.166
-Here you go.
-Oh, thank you.

1:08:57.250 --> 1:08:59.333
Now, bear with me.

1:08:59.416 --> 1:09:01.708
I've been making
this chili for myself for 35 years,

1:09:01.791 --> 1:09:04.875
so I have no idea
if it's safe for public consumption.

1:09:04.958 --> 1:09:08.083
-Smells good. I'll tell you that.
-All right, son, here you go.

1:09:10.041 --> 1:09:10.916
Mmm.

1:09:11.791 --> 1:09:14.125
Oh, it's more than safe.
It's really good. Thank you.

1:09:14.208 --> 1:09:16.541
-Mmm. That's great.
-It's really great.

1:09:16.625 --> 1:09:17.708
Fantastic.

1:09:17.791 --> 1:09:19.791
So would you happen to know

1:09:19.875 --> 1:09:22.500
where Noel moved
or where she might live now?

1:09:23.041 --> 1:09:23.875
Oh…

1:09:24.458 --> 1:09:28.625
You know, she sent me
something years ago. Hold on.

1:09:28.708 --> 1:09:30.458
-Really?
-Excuse me, baby.

1:09:33.416 --> 1:09:35.083
What do you think?

1:09:35.166 --> 1:09:37.208
Um, you have his eyes.

1:09:38.416 --> 1:09:39.291
Really?

1:09:40.166 --> 1:09:41.000
Yeah.

1:09:41.875 --> 1:09:42.958
It's a good thing.

1:09:46.583 --> 1:09:47.583
Well…

1:09:53.041 --> 1:09:55.416
-I, uh… Sorry.

1:09:56.125 --> 1:09:58.333
I always held on to this.
Don't ask me why.

1:10:03.916 --> 1:10:04.791
Uh…

1:10:19.666 --> 1:10:23.708
It says she's gonna be living with her
husband, Charles Hayden, in Ridgefield.

1:10:31.250 --> 1:10:32.500
Noel Hayden.

1:10:48.791 --> 1:10:52.083
I gotta say it.
You two would make a fantastic couple.

1:10:53.250 --> 1:10:55.708
-No, no, Rachel's engaged.
-Yeah.

1:10:55.791 --> 1:10:57.208
-Really?
-Yeah, big time.

1:10:58.541 --> 1:11:00.250
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1:11:00.833 --> 1:11:03.916
He must be a great guy
because you are one heck of a catch.

1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:06.291
-That she is.
-Okay.

1:11:06.375 --> 1:11:10.041
So, you'll let me know
how everything turns out?

1:11:10.125 --> 1:11:14.250
Oh, of course. Of course.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1:11:14.333 --> 1:11:15.958
You're welcome, sweetheart.

1:11:18.208 --> 1:11:19.458
Wish me luck.

1:11:19.541 --> 1:11:20.916
-Best of luck.
-Thanks.

1:11:25.791 --> 1:11:26.750
I, uh…

1:11:28.958 --> 1:11:31.458
-Thanks for wearing that watch, son.
-Oh.

1:11:31.541 --> 1:11:33.666
I can't tell you
how much that means to me.

1:11:37.208 --> 1:11:39.708
Yeah, come on. Come on.

1:11:45.125 --> 1:11:46.583
You grew up good.

1:11:47.375 --> 1:11:48.375
Real good.

1:11:51.541 --> 1:11:53.250
Well, um, stay in touch.

1:11:53.916 --> 1:11:55.375
-A hundred percent.
-Okay.

1:12:26.833 --> 1:12:28.125
You okay?

1:12:31.125 --> 1:12:34.291
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. Thank you.

1:12:37.458 --> 1:12:38.458
Yeah.

1:12:47.166 --> 1:12:50.916
<i>Today, my sweet baby girl was born.</i>

1:12:52.625 --> 1:12:56.375
<i>And I know I will never see her again.</i>

1:12:57.833 --> 1:12:59.708
"So I'm gonna leave this diary behind."

1:13:02.291 --> 1:13:05.541
"Maybe someday she'll read it
and understand how much I love her."

1:13:07.916 --> 1:13:09.666
<i>And always will.</i>

1:13:11.708 --> 1:13:12.958
"And always will."

1:13:19.833 --> 1:13:21.666
God, I hope that's true…

1:13:24.875 --> 1:13:26.666
…what she said about loving me.

1:13:40.916 --> 1:13:43.666
So I was thinking about Noel.

1:13:44.333 --> 1:13:47.916
Should I call her first, or do you think
I should just show up tomorrow?

1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:50.000
-What do you… what do you think?
-Hmm.

1:13:50.083 --> 1:13:52.875
I think get some sleep
and decide in the morning.

1:13:52.958 --> 1:13:53.791
Yeah.

1:13:55.916 --> 1:13:57.875
Like I'm gonna sleep.

1:13:59.708 --> 1:14:03.375
Um, let me just
triple check to make sure.

1:14:07.208 --> 1:14:11.125
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry,
but we only have one room available.

1:14:11.208 --> 1:14:14.000
-Oh, no, uh…
-We'll take it.

1:14:16.208 --> 1:14:17.250
We'll take it?

1:14:17.791 --> 1:14:19.208
Yeah, we'll…

1:14:19.291 --> 1:14:21.916
-You know, we'll take it.
-Great.

1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:23.000
Thank you.

1:14:35.500 --> 1:14:37.208
So…

1:14:38.208 --> 1:14:39.083
Um…

1:14:39.750 --> 1:14:41.541
I have a confession to make.

1:14:41.625 --> 1:14:42.708
-Confession?
-Yep.

1:14:42.791 --> 1:14:43.916
Uh-oh! What'd she do?

1:14:44.625 --> 1:14:46.375
Today is my birthday.

1:14:48.166 --> 1:14:49.250
-No!
-Yeah.

1:14:49.333 --> 1:14:51.208
-Today's your birthday?
-Yeah.

1:14:52.708 --> 1:14:55.250
You're kidding.
You're just now telling me this? This is…

1:14:56.083 --> 1:14:58.541
-What? You should have said something.
-Yeah.

1:14:58.625 --> 1:15:01.041
This is a big deal.
You should've said something.

1:15:01.125 --> 1:15:04.958
You know, you, uh, we can--
You know, it's a birthday. These are--

1:15:05.041 --> 1:15:07.833
-What are you doing?
-We're gonna celebrate your birthday!

1:15:07.916 --> 1:15:10.208
Hi! This is Jake Turner
from the Amber Suite.

1:15:10.291 --> 1:15:11.375
I was wondering if--

1:15:12.041 --> 1:15:15.458
Yeah, that Jake Turner. I--
Thank you. I appreciate it.

1:15:15.541 --> 1:15:17.625
Listen, I was wondering
if you could do me a favor?

1:15:17.708 --> 1:15:20.333
I've got a
birthday girl up here. I just found out.

1:15:20.416 --> 1:15:23.416
I know it's late notice,
but do you have a birthday cake

1:15:23.500 --> 1:15:26.708
or something,
a dessert you can put candles in?

1:15:30.208 --> 1:15:32.000
You do? Terrific.

1:15:32.083 --> 1:15:34.833
Uh, you know what? Yes, more red wine.

1:15:34.916 --> 1:15:36.875
And you might as well send up
some champagne too

1:15:36.958 --> 1:15:39.625
because it's a birthday,
champagne is for celebrating.

1:15:39.708 --> 1:15:41.083
Wonderful. Thank you very much.

1:15:48.250 --> 1:15:50.041
-You wanna dance?
-Really?

1:15:50.125 --> 1:15:50.958
Yeah.

1:15:51.041 --> 1:15:54.458
-Really?
-Yeah, come on. It's my birthday.

1:15:54.541 --> 1:15:56.458
It's your birthday. You're right. Okay.

1:17:02.208 --> 1:17:03.666
Happy birthday, Rachel.

1:17:04.875 --> 1:17:05.916
Make a wish.

1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:13.250
Way ahead of you.

1:18:04.041 --> 1:18:05.041
<i>Dear Jake.</i>

1:18:05.833 --> 1:18:10.083
<i>First of all, I want you to know</i>
<i>that last night was beautiful.</i>

1:18:10.833 --> 1:18:12.708
<i>And I'd be lying if I didn't admit</i>

1:18:12.791 --> 1:18:15.708
<i>that I've been thinking about it</i>
<i>since the moment we met.</i>

1:18:15.791 --> 1:18:19.208
<i>But I woke up in the middle of the night</i>
<i>feeling confused.</i>

1:18:20.208 --> 1:18:21.666
<i>Really, really confused.</i>

1:18:22.833 --> 1:18:25.000
<i>And the thing is Alan really loves me,</i>

1:18:26.458 --> 1:18:27.916
<i>and that's not nothing.</i>

1:18:29.958 --> 1:18:31.666
<i>And you have a very different life</i>

1:18:31.750 --> 1:18:34.291
<i>with best-selling books,</i>
<i>and a million Instagram followers,</i>

1:18:34.375 --> 1:18:35.208
<i>and I'm…</i>

1:18:36.166 --> 1:18:37.416
<i>just getting launched,</i>

1:18:37.500 --> 1:18:40.750
<i>which I totally understand,</i>
<i>at least to the extent that I can.</i>

1:18:41.250 --> 1:18:45.125
<i>It's just that I'm a person who needs</i>
<i>a lot of certainty in their life.</i>

1:18:45.208 --> 1:18:48.625
<i>And this time with you,</i>
<i>wonderful though it was,</i>

1:18:49.791 --> 1:18:50.791
<i>it isn't that.</i>

1:18:51.958 --> 1:18:55.708
<i>So I think it's better</i>
<i>that we part company now</i>

1:18:56.583 --> 1:18:57.916
<i>before it's too late,</i>

1:18:59.625 --> 1:19:00.708
<i>at least for me.</i>

1:19:03.291 --> 1:19:05.458
<i>And I realized something else,</i>

1:19:06.291 --> 1:19:07.291
<i>thanks to you.</i>

1:19:08.541 --> 1:19:11.458
<i>My whole life,</i>
<i>I thought my mother didn't want me</i>

1:19:11.958 --> 1:19:14.750
<i>and that I needed</i>
<i>to find her and ask her why.</i>

1:19:14.833 --> 1:19:19.166
<i>But now that I've read her diary,</i>
<i>I know that she did truly love me,</i>

1:19:19.250 --> 1:19:21.375
<i>and that's all that really matters.</i>

1:19:22.875 --> 1:19:24.458
<i>Thank you for everything,</i>

1:19:25.583 --> 1:19:29.208
<i>for going on this wild,</i>
<i>life-changing ride with me.</i>

1:19:30.458 --> 1:19:32.166
<i>I'll never, ever forget it.</i>

1:19:33.666 --> 1:19:34.666
<i>And, lastly,</i>

1:19:36.291 --> 1:19:37.958
<i>I'll never, ever forget you.</i>

1:19:48.083 --> 1:19:51.583
-Pardon me, the, uh, nurses' station?
-Um, down the hall, to the right.

1:19:51.666 --> 1:19:53.375
-To the right. Thank you.
-Welcome.

1:20:02.666 --> 1:20:05.666
Excuse me. Hi, can you tell me
where to find Noel Hayden?

1:20:07.875 --> 1:20:09.833
Hi, I'm Noel.

1:20:11.875 --> 1:20:14.166
I called your house,
your husband told me where to find you.

1:20:14.250 --> 1:20:16.375
I don't know if you remember me or not,
but, um…

1:20:17.833 --> 1:20:19.041
I'm Jacob Turner.

1:20:21.541 --> 1:20:22.708
Jacob?

1:20:26.375 --> 1:20:27.208
Wow.

1:20:30.416 --> 1:20:32.000
How are your folks?

1:20:32.791 --> 1:20:34.750
Uh, my folks? My, um…

1:20:36.458 --> 1:20:38.166
My mom just recently passed away.

1:20:39.416 --> 1:20:40.250
Oh.

1:20:41.166 --> 1:20:43.875
-I'm so sorry.
-Thank you. Yeah, it was very sudden.

1:20:43.958 --> 1:20:46.041
-But your dad, he's--
-He's good.

1:20:46.125 --> 1:20:47.166
He's, um…

1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:51.958
Yeah, I just saw him for the first time
in a really long time, actually.

1:20:52.041 --> 1:20:54.541
He's… He's good. He's hanging in.

1:20:55.916 --> 1:20:57.250
Like the rest of us.

1:20:57.333 --> 1:20:59.000
Like the rest of us, yeah.

1:21:00.500 --> 1:21:01.333
Um…

1:21:02.625 --> 1:21:05.000
You gotta be wondering
why I'm here after all these years.

1:21:06.583 --> 1:21:10.083
It's a really long,
complicated story, but…

1:21:11.041 --> 1:21:11.916
Noel,

1:21:13.041 --> 1:21:15.416
when my brother died,

1:21:16.875 --> 1:21:20.041
I didn't realize until just recently
how much you helped my family,

1:21:20.125 --> 1:21:21.291
how much you helped me.

1:21:22.541 --> 1:21:25.791
-You were just a little kid, Jake.
-But if you hadn't been there--

1:21:25.875 --> 1:21:26.875
But I was.

1:21:27.875 --> 1:21:29.291
And you got through it.

1:21:34.458 --> 1:21:36.083
Now that I'm here, I can say thank you.

1:21:37.250 --> 1:21:38.500
Now that you're here,

1:21:39.500 --> 1:21:40.583
you're welcome.

1:21:49.708 --> 1:21:53.333
There's one other thing I wanted
to talk to you about before I left, um…

1:21:55.416 --> 1:21:58.458
The child that you had, your daughter.

1:22:00.291 --> 1:22:01.125
Rachel.

1:22:04.166 --> 1:22:05.166
She's…

1:22:06.500 --> 1:22:09.541
wonderful, she's amazing.

1:22:10.125 --> 1:22:11.458
I wanted you to know that.

1:22:13.583 --> 1:22:14.958
You know her?

1:22:16.208 --> 1:22:17.750
I do know her, um…

1:22:19.666 --> 1:22:22.500
Yeah, she wanted to come here,
she wanted to meet you in person.

1:22:22.583 --> 1:22:25.958
And I think, you know, after…
after reading this…

1:22:31.041 --> 1:22:34.208
she felt a connection for sure, and, uh…

1:22:36.291 --> 1:22:37.916
she understands everything.

1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:38.833
Everything.

1:22:43.208 --> 1:22:45.166
Thank you for telling me that.

1:22:50.833 --> 1:22:51.958
Merry Christmas.

1:22:53.208 --> 1:22:54.583
Merry Christmas, Jacob.

1:22:57.291 --> 1:22:58.958
And thank you for this.

1:22:59.958 --> 1:23:01.333
It's a precious gift.

1:23:03.416 --> 1:23:04.458
And, Jake…

1:23:06.208 --> 1:23:07.583
if you see my daughter,

1:23:07.666 --> 1:23:10.750
would you tell her that
if she ever wants to get in touch,

1:23:12.041 --> 1:23:13.916
I would like that very much.

1:23:29.041 --> 1:23:30.166
Rachel.

1:23:51.083 --> 1:23:53.833
Your dad's been
working on this since Thanksgiving.

1:23:54.500 --> 1:23:55.625
I can't wait to see it.

1:23:55.708 --> 1:23:58.041
I think it's the most beautiful
he's ever done.

1:23:58.125 --> 1:24:00.250
-Yeah?

1:24:05.541 --> 1:24:07.541
Uh, when will Alan be coming?

1:24:08.208 --> 1:24:10.041
Uh, soon. Soon.

1:24:10.583 --> 1:24:13.666
-You don't sound too excited, honey.
-Well, I am, I just…

1:24:14.208 --> 1:24:17.208
I don't know, "excited" is a bit…
a strong word.

1:24:19.625 --> 1:24:23.958
I couldn't get it right until
finally last night at, like, 2:00 a.m.

1:24:33.750 --> 1:24:37.208
No, you got it right, Dad.
This is… It's perfect.

1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:43.375
I love it. This is…
It's perfect. Thank you.

1:24:50.500 --> 1:24:52.625
Honey, you don't want to talk to Alan?

1:24:52.708 --> 1:24:55.291
No, no, it's not that.
It's just that I don't, um…

1:24:55.375 --> 1:24:58.083
I don't know.
Things are… We'll talk later, and it's…

1:24:58.166 --> 1:25:00.458
We're sorting things…
sorting some things out right now.

1:25:00.541 --> 1:25:02.958
"Sorting some things out"?
I thought you guys made up.

1:25:03.041 --> 1:25:04.791
No, we-- We did, we just--

1:25:04.875 --> 1:25:07.833
You know, things are a little
up in the air right now.

1:25:07.916 --> 1:25:11.541
This is starting to sound
a little like that cigar engagement ring.

1:25:12.125 --> 1:25:15.000
-Dad, stop. Seriously.

1:25:15.791 --> 1:25:18.166
Um, sorry, guys, one sec.
I'll be right back.

1:25:29.833 --> 1:25:31.458
Jake, you've gotta stop calling.

1:25:31.541 --> 1:25:33.750
<i>No, I'm not gonna</i>
<i>stop calling until we talk.</i>

1:25:33.833 --> 1:25:35.250
I don't want to do this.

1:25:36.208 --> 1:25:37.625
Okay? I…

1:25:37.708 --> 1:25:39.875
So I'm gonna just hang up the phone now.

1:25:39.958 --> 1:25:42.166
Please don't try to find me, okay?

1:25:47.166 --> 1:25:48.250
Too late.

1:25:50.416 --> 1:25:51.625
Why are you doing this?

1:25:53.083 --> 1:25:54.458
Do you really have to ask?

1:25:54.541 --> 1:25:55.958
I'm not coming out.

1:25:57.583 --> 1:25:58.875
I'm not. I can't.

1:25:59.666 --> 1:26:02.625
Why? Why not? What are you…
What are you afraid of?

1:26:02.708 --> 1:26:03.708
What's gonna happen?

1:26:03.791 --> 1:26:05.208
Jake, you don't understand.

1:26:06.916 --> 1:26:09.583
You don't. I have finally found something…

1:26:09.666 --> 1:26:10.958
that I can really…

1:26:11.750 --> 1:26:14.375
I can really count on, and…

1:26:16.166 --> 1:26:18.541
It may not be perfect,
but it's what I want.

1:26:20.041 --> 1:26:21.416
It's what I need.

1:26:21.916 --> 1:26:23.041
Okay?

1:26:23.125 --> 1:26:24.625
So I need you to understand that.

1:26:24.708 --> 1:26:27.083
I do understand.
I understand the whole thing.

1:26:27.166 --> 1:26:28.416
I understand that…

1:26:29.958 --> 1:26:32.708
what you may have needed before,
you don't need anymore.

1:26:34.833 --> 1:26:35.833
Look at me, I…

1:26:36.458 --> 1:26:38.750
All I wanted my entire life
was to be alone.

1:26:39.333 --> 1:26:42.833
And it's hard for people like us
to trust, right?

1:26:42.916 --> 1:26:43.958
To let people in.

1:26:44.041 --> 1:26:47.375
It's hard. I understand that.
But here I am, right here, right now.

1:26:47.458 --> 1:26:50.958
And I am standing here with the
only friend I have in the entire world.

1:26:51.041 --> 1:26:53.000
I'm staring at the woman that I love,

1:26:53.625 --> 1:26:56.625
and I'm begging you to trust me.

1:26:56.708 --> 1:26:58.458
I'm telling you, you can trust me.

1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:01.583
Just let me in, please.

1:27:06.250 --> 1:27:07.166
Let me in.

1:27:11.708 --> 1:27:12.833
Tell me

1:27:13.708 --> 1:27:14.791
you don't love me.

1:27:20.833 --> 1:27:22.500
Jake, that's Alan. You gotta go.

1:27:22.583 --> 1:27:26.416
You tell me that you don't love me
and I'll go.

1:27:37.666 --> 1:27:38.666
I don't love you.

1:29:51.208 --> 1:29:53.958
Saw your truck, thought we'd
pop by and wish you Merry Christmas.

1:29:54.041 --> 1:29:55.500
Oh, thank you.

1:29:55.583 --> 1:29:57.458
Yes, I was packing up a few things,

1:29:57.541 --> 1:29:59.916
then I need to lock up,
and then take off, so…

1:30:00.583 --> 1:30:03.041
Would you care to join us for dinner?
We'd love to have you.

1:30:03.125 --> 1:30:05.583
We really would.
We're having a few people over.

1:30:05.666 --> 1:30:07.750
It's Christmas dinner, all the trimmings.

1:30:07.833 --> 1:30:09.833
I would, I would love to, and thank you,

1:30:09.916 --> 1:30:12.333
but I should take off
before the roads get too slick.

1:30:12.416 --> 1:30:14.208
How did things go with your father?

1:30:14.791 --> 1:30:16.458
Um, you know, they…

1:30:16.541 --> 1:30:19.250
Better than expected.
Much better, actually.

1:30:19.333 --> 1:30:20.708
-I told you.
-You did.

1:30:20.791 --> 1:30:22.333
And Rachel and her mom?

1:30:22.416 --> 1:30:24.458
I think that's gonna work itself out.

1:30:24.541 --> 1:30:26.791
That's very good news. Excellent.

1:30:27.291 --> 1:30:29.583
Oh, bloody hell,
I've gotta go baste the ham.

1:30:29.666 --> 1:30:30.916
You sure you can't stay?

1:30:31.708 --> 1:30:33.541
Well, Happy Christmas, old boy.

1:30:33.625 --> 1:30:36.125
-Happy basting.
-I'll be right there.

1:30:36.208 --> 1:30:37.291
Come on in.

1:30:41.458 --> 1:30:42.916
And you and Rachel?

1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:44.583
Oh, um…

1:30:46.083 --> 1:30:49.000
No? Really? I was so sure.

1:30:50.666 --> 1:30:52.083
Well, Kerouac said it.

1:30:53.083 --> 1:30:54.750
"It all ends in tears, anyway."

1:30:56.541 --> 1:30:59.083
But I'll be okay,
and Rachel will be okay too.

1:30:59.166 --> 1:31:00.208
Of course.

1:31:01.166 --> 1:31:02.166
Merry Christmas.

1:31:02.875 --> 1:31:04.000
For me?

1:31:04.083 --> 1:31:05.375
What did you do here?

1:31:12.916 --> 1:31:14.250
Oh, Ellie…

1:31:16.500 --> 1:31:17.416
You put the…

1:31:18.791 --> 1:31:19.875
tree back in.

1:31:19.958 --> 1:31:21.000
Yes.

1:31:23.416 --> 1:31:25.625
I have wonderful memories of this house.

1:31:25.708 --> 1:31:28.041
You and Benji playing in the yard.

1:31:29.291 --> 1:31:30.291
Your folks.

1:31:33.291 --> 1:31:34.458
Merry Christmas.

1:31:35.833 --> 1:31:38.458
-Take care.
-Oh, you too. Take care of yourself too.

1:31:38.541 --> 1:31:41.208
And thank you. This is just…
You're special.
