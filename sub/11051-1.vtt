00:40.749 --> 00:43.332
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

00:51.552 --> 00:54.420
- Uh, yeah?
- Miles, can you move your car, please?

00:54.555 --> 00:57.423
- Why?
- Because the roofers gotta get the truck in.

00:57.558 --> 01:00.016
- You didn't park too good. Okay?
- Yeah. All right.

01:00.102 --> 01:02.094
Hold on.

01:21.832 --> 01:24.745
Sorry.
Sorry, gentlemen.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.997
Sorry.

01:58.744 --> 02:01.111
Oh, fuck me!

02:01.204 --> 02:04.368
<i>I know I said
I would be there by noon,</i>

02:04.458 --> 02:08.293
but, uh, there's all of this work
going on at my building,

02:08.377 --> 02:10.791
and it's just
a total nightmare.

02:10.881 --> 02:14.295
I had a bunch of stuff
I had to deal with this morning,

02:14.384 --> 02:16.296
but I'm on my way.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.878
I'm out the door right now.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.146
<i>- Hi, Simon.
- Hey, Miles.</i>

02:37.240 --> 02:39.152
<i>- Triple espresso, please.</i>
- For here?

02:39.242 --> 02:42.155
Uh, no, actually.
I'm running late. Make it to go.

02:42.245 --> 02:45.158
And give me a <i>New York Times</i>
and a spinach croissant.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.864
Thank you.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.891
- Ah!
- Well, hello!

03:56.027 --> 03:58.235
- Hello, Mrs. Erganian. How are you?
- Come on in.

03:58.363 --> 04:01.322
- Thank you. Is Jack still here?
- Yes.

04:04.786 --> 04:08.200
<i>Shot on the way to the 118.</i>

04:10.792 --> 04:12.658
Look what the cat dragged.

04:12.794 --> 04:15.707
- Hi, everybody. Sorry.
- Hey.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.709
Somebody finally arrived.

04:17.798 --> 04:19.665
You finally got here.
Mr. Prompt.

04:19.801 --> 04:22.714
- Oh, remember my kids? Alex, Helen?
- Hi. How are you?

04:22.804 --> 04:26.172
<i>We were thinking maybe you went
the wrong way, you went to Tijuana...</i>

04:26.308 --> 04:28.174
- Right.
- and they don't let you back.

04:28.310 --> 04:30.176
- Yes! Yes!
- Daddy!

04:30.312 --> 04:33.225
- I had to bribe them.
- Hey, Miles.

04:33.315 --> 04:35.181
Hey. How are you,
Christine?

04:35.317 --> 04:37.183
Yeah, the freeway was unbelievable.

04:37.319 --> 04:40.232
- Unbelievable. It was bumper-to-bumper the whole way.
- Sure, sure.

04:40.322 --> 04:43.235
People getting an early start
on the weekend, I guess.

04:43.325 --> 04:45.191
Granted, I got
a late start, but...

04:45.327 --> 04:47.740
- Well, we're just glad you made it.
- Yes.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.196
Christine, why don't you
ask Miles about the cake?

04:50.332 --> 04:52.244
- Oh, good idea. Come with me.
- What's this?

04:52.334 --> 04:55.202
We don't really have time for that,
'cause we gotta hit the road.

04:55.337 --> 04:58.501
- <i>Oh, come on! It's just gonna take a second!</i>
- Yeah.

04:58.590 --> 05:01.082
<i>Mmm.</i>

05:01.176 --> 05:03.293
Jack tells us you are publishing a book.
Congratulations.

05:03.428 --> 05:06.341
- Uh...
- Yes, congratulations.

05:06.431 --> 05:10.175
Yes, well, uh, it's not exactly
finalized yet.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.769
- So... There has been some interest, and...
- Your friend is modest.

05:13.855 --> 05:17.019
Oh, come on, Miles. Don't be so modest.
Indulge them.

05:17.150 --> 05:20.314
<i>- Don't make me out to be a liar.
- What is the subject of your book?</i>

05:20.445 --> 05:22.687
- Nonfiction?
<i>- Uh, no. It's... It's a novel.</i>

05:22.823 --> 05:25.065
<i>- Fiction. Yes.</i>
- Oh.

05:25.158 --> 05:28.071
Although there is quite a bit
from my own life,

05:28.161 --> 05:31.074
so I suppose that, technically,
some of it is nonfiction.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.406
<i>Good.
I like nonfiction.</i>

05:33.500 --> 05:35.913
There is so much to know
about this world.

05:36.002 --> 05:39.461
I think you read something somebody
just invented it, waste of time.

05:40.966 --> 05:42.832
That's an interesting
perspective.

05:42.968 --> 05:46.336
- So, which one do you like better?
- Oh, well, I like them both.

05:46.429 --> 05:49.843
But, um, if pressed,
I would have to say that I prefer the dark.

05:49.975 --> 05:52.342
<i>Told ya!</i>

05:52.477 --> 05:54.719
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.440
Bye.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.698
Bye.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.656
Where the fuck were you, man? Huh?
I was dying in there.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.955
- We're supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
- I can't help the traffic.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.957
Oh, come on. You're fucking hungover.
You know you are.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.630
Okay, there was
a tasting last night, yes.

06:23.717 --> 06:27.461
But I wanted to get us something nice
for the ride up. Check out the box.

06:27.554 --> 06:30.422
Why did you tell them that my novel
was being published?

06:30.557 --> 06:34.221
- 'Cause you said you had it all lined up.
- No, I didn't. No. No.

06:34.311 --> 06:37.600
What I said was that there was
some interest at Conundrum.

06:37.731 --> 06:41.645
- Yeah. Conundrum.
- And that one of the editors was passing it to a senior editor.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.148
Sounds pretty good to me.
Sounds like you're in.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.149
No. It's a long shot.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.732
Besides, Conundrum, it's just a small
specialty press.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.738
I'm not gonna
get my hopes up.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.740
You know?
I've stopped caring.

06:53.830 --> 06:56.743
The hell with it.
I have stopped caring.

06:56.833 --> 07:00.042
It sounds like it's gonna happen this time.
I mean, I can feel it.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.541
I think this is the one.
Huh?

07:02.631 --> 07:04.497
I'm really proud
of you, man.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.625
- Don't open that now. It's warm.
- Why not?

07:06.718 --> 07:10.837
Jack, that is a 1992 Byron.
It's really rare. Okay?

07:10.972 --> 07:13.464
- I've been saving it. Don't...
- All right. I won't open it.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.512
Jack!

07:15.602 --> 07:17.719
Half of it gone.

07:17.812 --> 07:21.226
Hey, shut up.
Okay?

07:21.316 --> 07:24.184
Here's to a great week.

07:24.319 --> 07:26.311
Come on.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.156
Yes. Absolutely.

07:30.241 --> 07:32.153
Despite your crass behavior,

07:32.243 --> 07:34.451
I'm actually glad we're getting
this time together.

07:34.537 --> 07:36.449
Yeah. Me too.

07:36.539 --> 07:39.407
I've been looking forward
to this for a long time.

07:39.542 --> 07:42.580
- Was beginning to think it was never gonna happen.
- Man! That's tasty!

07:42.671 --> 07:44.583
That's 100% pinot noir.
Single vineyard.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.539
They don't even
make it anymore.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.541
- Pinot noir?
- Mm-hmm.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.547
- Then how come it's white?
- Oh, Jesus.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.503
Don't ask questions like that
up in wine country.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.928
- They'll think you're some kind of dumbshit.
- Just tell me.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.930
Color in red wines
comes from the skins.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.854
This juice, on the other hand,
is free run,

08:01.940 --> 08:04.933
so that there's no skin contact
during fermentation...

08:06.444 --> 08:08.902
<i>Did you read the latest draft,
by the way?</i>

08:09.030 --> 08:10.942
<i>- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- And?</i>

08:11.032 --> 08:12.944
It's great.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.947
I mean, there are so many improvements.
It's much tighter.

08:16.037 --> 08:18.324
Just seems... I don't know,
more congealed or something.

08:18.415 --> 08:22.910
Mm-hmm. What about the new ending?
Did you like that?

08:23.003 --> 08:27.543
Oh, yeah. New ending vastly superior
to the old ending.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.544
There is no new ending.

08:29.634 --> 08:32.592
Page 750 on
is exactly the same.

08:34.972 --> 08:37.181
Well, maybe
it just seemed new...

08:37.267 --> 08:39.884
because everything leading up to it
was so different?

08:39.977 --> 08:41.970
Yeah!
That must be it!

08:45.775 --> 08:47.641
Whoa.
Why are we getting off?

08:47.777 --> 08:50.645
- Uh, I just wanna make one quick stop.
- For what?

08:50.780 --> 08:53.693
- I just thought we could say a quick hello to my mother.
- Your mother?

08:53.783 --> 08:55.649
<i>Look, it's her birthday
tomorrow. Okay?</i>

08:55.785 --> 08:58.994
<i>- And I don't feel right driving by and not stopping in.
- Okay.</i>

08:59.122 --> 09:01.990
<i>- It'll take a second. She's right off the freeway.
- Okay!</i>

09:02.083 --> 09:04.996
<i>I didn't know it was her birthday.
How old is she gonna be?</i>

09:05.086 --> 09:08.079
<i>Oh, 70-something.</i>

09:13.845 --> 09:17.179
Oh. Here, hold these
for just a second.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.981
Thank you.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.868
<i>- Surprise!
- Surprise!</i>

09:48.004 --> 09:49.916
- Happy birthday, Mom!
- Happy birthday!

09:50.006 --> 09:53.750
Oh, my God!
Miles! And Jack!

09:53.843 --> 09:57.257
What a surprise!

09:57.347 --> 10:01.182
I can't remember the last time
you brought me flowers!

10:01.267 --> 10:03.179
Happy birthday, Mom.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.135
They're from both of us.

10:05.271 --> 10:09.936
- A famous actor bringing me flowers for my birthday!
- Right? Yeah!

10:10.068 --> 10:13.652
<i>- Don't I feel special?
- And champagne!</i>

10:13.738 --> 10:16.947
- Famous actor's getting married next week, Mom.
- Oh, that's right!

10:17.033 --> 10:18.945
Isn't that nice.

10:19.035 --> 10:22.369
I hope that girl knows
how lucky she is...

10:22.455 --> 10:25.368
marrying no less
than Derek Sommersby.

10:25.458 --> 10:29.327
Gosh, that was, like, 11 years ago,
Mrs. Raymond.

10:29.462 --> 10:33.502
<i>Well, you were wonderful in that show!</i>

10:33.591 --> 10:38.837
Why that didn't make you the biggest
movie star in the world is a sin!

10:38.930 --> 10:41.388
<i>Oh, now, Miles,</i>

10:41.474 --> 10:45.514
why didn't you tell me you were coming
and bringing this handsome man?

10:45.603 --> 10:47.515
Look how
I'm dressed!

10:47.605 --> 10:50.018
I've gotta run
and put my face on.

10:50.108 --> 10:52.020
You look fabulous,
Mrs. Raymond.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.646
Oh, stop it!

10:53.736 --> 10:55.602
<i>Make yourselves comfortable.</i>

10:55.738 --> 10:58.651
<i>- You boys hungry?</i>
- Yeah, I'm hungry.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.609
<i>Along with the battle casualties...</i>

11:01.703 --> 11:03.615
Just a snack.

11:03.705 --> 11:05.617
<i>the Germans lost
almost a million men.</i>

11:05.707 --> 11:09.075
To replace them, Hitler turned
to his last resort of manpower.

11:13.965 --> 11:16.252
This is delicious, Mrs. Raymond.
Absolutely delicious.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.797
- Mmm.
- They're just leftovers.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.799
I-Is this chicken?

11:20.889 --> 11:22.801
I could have made
something fancier...

11:22.891 --> 11:25.804
if a certain someone had let me know
that a certain someone...

11:25.894 --> 11:29.854
was coming for a visit and bringing
a certain special friend.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.646
It was a surprise, Mom.

11:31.733 --> 11:34.146
And I could've already
put clean sheets...

11:34.235 --> 11:36.227
on the other bed
and the foldout.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.233
You are staying.

11:38.323 --> 11:43.193
Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up
at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton.

11:43.286 --> 11:45.528
They do
a magnificent job there.

11:45.622 --> 11:48.535
- You talked to Wendy?
- Just now.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.083
She's thrilled!
And the twins...

11:51.169 --> 11:53.582
<i>No, no, I bet.
I bet. Yeah.</i>

11:53.671 --> 11:57.665
Well, you know, Jack is pretty eager to,
uh, to get up to, um...

11:57.759 --> 11:59.842
<i>You know.</i>

11:59.928 --> 12:03.137
Uh, but, yeah, absolutely.
We'll see how it goes.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.100
Well, you boys
do what you want.

12:08.186 --> 12:11.896
I just thought it would be nice for us to
be together as a family on my birthday.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.268
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

12:15.485 --> 12:18.102
I'll be right back.

13:45.700 --> 13:48.613
And what was
that other one you did?

13:48.703 --> 13:51.116
The one where
you were the jogger.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.993
Oh, that was for, um,
Spray 'n Wash.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.995
Spray 'n Wash!
That's the one!

13:56.085 --> 14:00.170
Gosh. I remember the girl that was
in it with me. She was somethin'.

14:00.256 --> 14:03.169
<i>I just remember you jogging.</i>

14:03.259 --> 14:05.672
Whoo-hoo!

14:05.762 --> 14:08.175
<i>So, when's the wedding?</i>

14:08.264 --> 14:11.348
Next Saturday, Mom.
Remember? We told you.

14:11.434 --> 14:14.347
And Miles is my best man,
Mrs. Raymond. My main man.

14:14.437 --> 14:17.350
Miles, when are you going
to get married again?

14:19.525 --> 14:21.812
I just got divorced,
Phyllis.

14:21.903 --> 14:23.986
<i>Two years ago, buddy.</i>

14:25.073 --> 14:26.985
You should get
back together...

14:27.075 --> 14:29.317
with Victoria.

14:29.410 --> 14:32.118
She was good for you.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.993
She was good for you!

14:35.083 --> 14:37.450
And so beautiful,
and so intelligent.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.455
You knew her, right?

14:39.545 --> 14:42.379
<i>Oh, yeah. Real well.
Still do.</i>

14:43.383 --> 14:45.875
<i>I'm worried about you,
Miles.</i>

14:49.347 --> 14:51.430
Do you need some money?

14:53.726 --> 14:55.843
<i>Jack.</i>

14:57.188 --> 14:59.430
<i>Jack.</i>

14:59.524 --> 15:01.481
Jack, come on.

15:07.198 --> 15:10.612
<i>A rubber bag food slinger?</i>

15:10.701 --> 15:12.613
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

15:12.703 --> 15:14.615
<i>Our super-amazing
tree house,</i>

15:14.705 --> 15:17.618
<i>brought about by our
two-by-four technology...</i>

15:17.708 --> 15:20.917
Jack! No, no, no, no.
She'll wake up.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.915
Who did this?

15:23.005 --> 15:25.918
- I did!
- What?

15:26.008 --> 15:27.920
She was tired, silly.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.922
Our ship
was so high!

15:30.012 --> 15:31.924
They need a vacation!

15:32.014 --> 15:34.506
Hamster holiday!
Fun for all!

15:48.364 --> 15:51.402
Fuck! Too early in the morning for that.
You know what I mean?

15:51.492 --> 15:54.826
Oh. She's a kid,
for God's sake.

15:54.912 --> 15:57.825
<i>As if she would even be attracted
to guys like us in the first place.</i>

15:57.915 --> 16:01.454
Speak for yourself, man. I get chicks
looking at me all the time. All ages.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.456
Dudes too.

16:03.546 --> 16:06.289
Well, it's not worth it.
You pay too big a price.

16:06.424 --> 16:09.713
<i>- It's never free.</i>
- You need to get laid, Miles.

16:09.844 --> 16:12.507
That's gonna be my
best-man gift to you this week.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.884
I'm gonna get you laid.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.761
Wonderful.

16:16.851 --> 16:20.595
I'm not gonna get you a gift certificate or
a penknife or any of that other horseshit.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.847
- I'd rather have a knife.
- No.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.648
You have been officially depressed for,
like, two years now.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.603
You're a negative guy anyway,
even back in college.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.650
- Mm-hmm.
- And now it's worse.

16:30.740 --> 16:34.029
You're wasting away.
Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders?

16:34.118 --> 16:36.986
When they oughta be reading what <i>you</i> wrote.
<i>Your</i> books, Miles.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.909
- I'm working on it.<i>
- Not working hard enough.</i>

16:40.041 --> 16:43.455
- Are you still seeing that shrink? <i>
- I saw him on Monday.</i>

16:43.544 --> 16:46.412
I spent most of the time
helping him with his computer.

16:46.506 --> 16:51.092
Well, I say fuck therapy and...
What is that stuff you take? Xanax?

16:51.177 --> 16:53.214
And Lexapro, yes.

16:53.304 --> 16:56.672
Well, I say fuck that too.
You need to get your joint worked on, Miles.

16:56.766 --> 16:59.634
<i>Okay, Jack... Jack...</i>

16:59.727 --> 17:03.266
This week is not about me.
It is about you.

17:04.315 --> 17:07.228
I'm gonna show <i>you</i>
a good time.

17:07.318 --> 17:10.732
We're gonna drink a lot of good wine,
we're gonna play some golf,

17:10.820 --> 17:13.733
we're gonna eat some great food,
enjoy the scenery,

17:13.824 --> 17:17.192
and we're gonna send <i>you</i> off in style,
<i>mon frÃ¨re.</i>

17:17.286 --> 17:20.119
And get <i>your</i> bone
smooched.

17:36.472 --> 17:38.384
<i>You know what?</i>

17:38.474 --> 17:42.093
Let's take the Santa Rosa Road
exit and hit Sanford first. Okay?

17:42.186 --> 17:44.678
Sounds good to me.
I need a drink.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.685
These guys make top-notch
pinot and chardonnay.

17:47.775 --> 17:50.142
One of the best producers
in Santa Barbara County.

17:50.278 --> 17:53.191
- I thought you hated chardonnay. No, no, no.
- I like all varietals.

17:53.281 --> 17:56.865
I just don't generally like the way they
manipulate chardonnay in California.

17:56.993 --> 18:00.862
- Too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation.
- Huh.

18:00.955 --> 18:04.869
You see, the reason that this
region is so good for pinot...

18:04.959 --> 18:08.293
is that the cold air off the
Pacific flows in at night...

18:08.379 --> 18:10.917
and it just
cools down the berries.

18:11.007 --> 18:13.841
Pinot's a very
thin-skinned grape.

18:13.926 --> 18:17.465
It doesn't like constant heat or humidity.
Very delicate.

18:20.016 --> 18:22.429
<i>Let me show
you how this is done.</i>

18:22.518 --> 18:25.431
First thing... hold the glass up and
examine the wine against the light.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.683
You're looking
for color and clarity.

18:27.815 --> 18:30.228
- Just get a sense of it. Okay?
- Okay.

18:30.318 --> 18:33.311
Thick? Thin?
Watery? Syrupy?

18:33.404 --> 18:35.270
- Okay?
- Okay.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.276
Now tip it.

18:37.366 --> 18:41.861
What you're doing here is checking for color
density as it thins out towards the rim.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.867
<i>That's gonna tell you how old it is,
among other things.</i>

18:44.957 --> 18:46.869
<i>It's usually
more important with reds.</i>

18:46.959 --> 18:48.871
- Okay?
- Okay.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.827
Now stick your nose
in it.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.376
- Yeah?
- Don't be shy.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.753
Really get your nose
right in there. Really...

18:57.386 --> 18:59.423
Mmm.
A little citrus.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.556
Maybe some strawberry.
Mmm.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.392
Passion fruit.
Mmm.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.392
And... Ah, there's just,
like, the faintest...

19:09.482 --> 19:13.066
soupÃ§on of like,
uh, asparagus and...

19:13.152 --> 19:16.145
There's a... just a flutter
of, like, a...

19:16.238 --> 19:19.026
like,
a nutty Edam cheese.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.150
Wow.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.109
Mmm!

19:23.245 --> 19:25.111
- Strawberries. Yeah.
- Good.

19:25.247 --> 19:27.409
- Strawberries. Not the cheese.
- All right.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.413
Put your glass down.
Get some air into it.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.415
Oxygenating it
opens it up.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.122
It unlocks the aromas, the flavors.
Very important.

19:35.257 --> 19:37.624
Smell again.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.586
Ah. That's what you do
with every one of 'em.

19:40.721 --> 19:43.213
- Wow. When do we drink it?
- Now.

19:44.725 --> 19:47.934
Mmm! Ahh.

19:50.815 --> 19:53.523
- Mmm.
- How would you rate this one, Miles?

19:53.609 --> 19:56.317
Well, usually they start you on
wines with learning disabilities,

19:56.404 --> 19:58.270
but this one
is pretty damn good.

19:58.406 --> 20:02.241
<i>- This is the new one. Right, Chris?</i>
- Just released two months ago.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.280
- Nice job.
- We like it.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.657
You could work in a wine store,
Miles.

20:06.747 --> 20:09.660
Mmm. Yeah.
That'd be a good move.

20:11.502 --> 20:13.494
Are you chewing gum?

20:50.541 --> 20:53.454
Do you think I'm making a
mistake marrying Christine?

20:53.544 --> 20:55.456
Whoa!

20:55.546 --> 20:58.960
Do you think I'm doing the right thing,
Miles? Tell me the truth.

20:59.049 --> 21:01.416
I mean,
you've been there.

21:01.510 --> 21:05.424
Well, you know, I...
I think that you waited for some good reason,

21:05.514 --> 21:08.427
and that you proposed to
Christine for some good reason,

21:08.517 --> 21:10.930
so I think
it's great.

21:11.020 --> 21:12.932
It's time.

21:13.022 --> 21:15.935
I mean, you gotta have your eyes open,
that's all.

21:16.025 --> 21:19.939
I mean, look at me.
I thought Victoria and I were set for life.

21:20.029 --> 21:22.942
Christine's dad,
he's really been talking to me...

21:23.032 --> 21:26.946
about bringing me into his property business,
showing me the ropes.

21:27.036 --> 21:30.950
Which is something, considering how long it
took him to get over my not being Armenian.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.952
So I'm thinking about it.

21:33.042 --> 21:34.954
But I don't know.

21:35.044 --> 21:36.956
Might get
a little incestuous.

21:37.046 --> 21:39.914
But Mike does great.
A lot of high-end commercial stuff.

21:40.049 --> 21:42.462
- So you're gonna stop acting?
- No way! No.

21:42.551 --> 21:45.294
This would just provide
some stability.

21:45.387 --> 21:49.006
I could always squeeze in a commercial
or an audition here, there.

21:49.099 --> 21:52.012
Keep myself in the game in case
something really great came along.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.014
We're not getting
any younger, Miles.

21:54.104 --> 21:55.766
No. No.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.899
<i>- Hey, hey, hey!</i>
- Hey.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.855
- Miles!
- Sir.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.358
- Long time no see.
- Gary, nice to see you.

22:08.494 --> 22:11.407
- When's your novel coming out? We all wanna read it.
- Soon, soon, soon.

22:11.497 --> 22:14.365
This is my buddy Jack.
He's getting married next week.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.867
- My condolences, man.
- What are you pouring tonight?

22:17.002 --> 22:19.915
- Uh, we have got a lot of good stuff.
- Mm-hmm?

22:20.005 --> 22:22.918
Ah, we have the, uh, new Bien Nacido.
You want a taste?

22:23.008 --> 22:24.920
<i>Absolument.</i>

22:25.010 --> 22:27.923
They make their own wine here.
It's just outstanding.

22:28.013 --> 22:30.005
Very special.
Thank you.

22:33.018 --> 22:35.010
Mmm!

22:36.605 --> 22:38.597
- Mmm.
- So, what do you think?

22:40.609 --> 22:44.523
Tighter than a nun's asshole.
But good concentration. Nice fruit.

22:44.613 --> 22:47.026
Pour us a couple,
will ya.

22:47.116 --> 22:49.233
Yeah.
It's tight.

22:51.912 --> 22:53.824
There you are,
gentlemen.

22:53.914 --> 22:56.907
I will leave you the bottle.
And it is good to see you.

22:58.210 --> 23:01.544
Hey, man.
Here's to my last week of freedom.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.542
It's gonna be great.

23:03.632 --> 23:05.624
Here's to us.

23:12.141 --> 23:14.053
<i>- Miles.</i>
- Mm-hmm?

23:14.143 --> 23:16.556
<i>Check out that chick.</i>

23:16.645 --> 23:19.228
Oh. Yeah.
That's Maya.

23:19.356 --> 23:22.224
<i>- You know her?
- Sure, I know Maya.</i>

23:22.359 --> 23:25.978
<i>- You know</i> that <i>chick?
- Yes. Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here.</i>

23:26.071 --> 23:28.279
You know?
It's practically my office.

23:28.365 --> 23:31.278
And occasionally I have a drink
with the employees, yeah.

23:31.368 --> 23:35.282
<i>Maya's great.
She's worked here a year, year and a half.</i>

23:35.372 --> 23:37.284
<i>She's incredibly hot.</i>

23:37.374 --> 23:39.661
<i>Yes, she is.
And nice. And married.</i>

23:39.752 --> 23:41.664
Check out the rock.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.666
Oh, that doesn't
mean shit.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.668
When Christine
worked at Sushi Roku,

23:45.758 --> 23:48.501
she wore a big engagement ring to
keep guys from hitting on her.

23:48.594 --> 23:51.507
Think it worked? Fuck no.
How do you think / met her?

23:51.597 --> 23:56.513
Well, this gal is married to some
philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.

23:56.602 --> 23:59.936
What's a professor's wife doing waitressing?
Obviously that's over.

24:00.022 --> 24:02.935
Jack, you don't know
anything about this woman.

24:03.025 --> 24:06.189
Calm down.
Let's just eat.

24:08.822 --> 24:11.485
- Hey, Miles!
- Oh! Hi, Maya.

24:11.575 --> 24:14.488
- How are you?
- I'm good. Good.

24:14.578 --> 24:17.241
You look great.
Did you lose some weight?

24:18.374 --> 24:20.957
Uh, no, actually.

24:21.043 --> 24:22.830
But... thank you.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.412
- Busy night, huh?
- Sunday.

24:25.506 --> 24:27.418
You guys been out tasting?

24:27.508 --> 24:29.670
Oh, you know it.
You know it.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.877
Oh, this is my friend, Jack.
Jack, Maya.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.883
- Hiya.
- Hi.

24:33.973 --> 24:36.590
Well, it's good to see you.
Bye, Miles.

24:36.684 --> 24:39.222
<i>Oh.
Back to work.</i>

24:41.355 --> 24:44.268
- Jesus, she is jammin'.
- Yeah.

24:44.358 --> 24:46.270
And she's obviously
into you.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.272
What else do you know
about her?

24:48.362 --> 24:50.524
Well, she does know
a lot about wine.

24:51.573 --> 24:54.486
Ah. Now we're
getting somewhere.

24:54.618 --> 24:57.531
- She likes pinot.
- Perfect!

24:57.621 --> 25:00.113
She's a fucking waitress
in Buellton, Jack.

25:00.207 --> 25:02.119
How is that
ever gonna work out?

25:02.209 --> 25:04.451
You dick.
Why do you have to focus on the negative?

25:04.586 --> 25:08.375
- See how friendly she was to you?
- She works for tips.

25:10.134 --> 25:12.046
You're blind, dude.
Blind.

25:12.136 --> 25:16.130
I can also recommend the ostrich steak.
Very lean. Locally raised.

25:20.310 --> 25:22.222
Hey, Gary.

25:22.312 --> 25:24.178
- Highliner, please.
- You got it.

25:24.314 --> 25:26.226
- That's on us.
- Yes, indeed.

25:26.316 --> 25:28.182
Well, hey, guys.
Do you mind?

25:28.318 --> 25:30.230
- Oh, no, no, no.
- You sure?

25:30.320 --> 25:32.733
Please.
Light up, light up.

25:35.492 --> 25:38.326
In fact, would you
like to join us?

25:40.748 --> 25:42.910
Sure.

25:46.295 --> 25:48.708
So,
how's that book coming, Miles?

25:48.797 --> 25:51.665
I think you were almost finished
with it the last time we talked.

25:51.800 --> 25:56.170
- I finished it.
- Good for you! Wow.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.175
It's getting published.

25:58.265 --> 26:01.554
That's, uh, actually why
we're up here celebrating.

26:01.643 --> 26:04.135
Well, congratulations.

26:04.271 --> 26:06.137
- That's fantastic!
- Yeah.

26:06.273 --> 26:08.265
- Cheers.
- Thanks.

26:09.443 --> 26:11.355
Are you a writer too?

26:11.445 --> 26:13.357
No, Maya,
I'm an actor.

26:13.447 --> 26:15.860
Really.
What kind of stuff?

26:15.949 --> 26:17.861
Mmm, a lot ofTV.

26:17.951 --> 26:21.365
I used to be a regular
on a couple of series.

26:21.455 --> 26:26.041
But lately it's been a lot of
commercial work. Nationals, mostly.

26:26.126 --> 26:28.038
Anything I might know?

26:28.128 --> 26:30.711
Perhaps.
Do you recognize this?

26:30.798 --> 26:35.088
Now with a low, low
5.8% A.P.R. financing!

26:35.177 --> 26:37.043
That's hilarious!

26:37.179 --> 26:40.047
- You sound just like one of those guys.
- Am one of those guys.

26:40.182 --> 26:42.094
- You are not.
- He is.

26:42.184 --> 26:44.392
Consult your doctor
before using this product.

26:44.478 --> 26:46.390
Side effects may include
oily discharge,

26:46.480 --> 26:48.392
hives, loss of appetite,
low blood pressure.

26:48.482 --> 26:51.566
If you have diabetes
or a history of kidney trouble,

26:51.652 --> 26:53.564
you're <i>dead,</i> asshole!

26:53.654 --> 26:55.566
Yeah.

26:55.656 --> 26:57.818
So, what are you guys
up to tonight?

26:59.201 --> 27:01.067
Oh, we're pretty wiped.

27:01.161 --> 27:06.202
I think we're just gonna
go back to the motel and crash.

27:07.751 --> 27:10.209
Yeah, I guess it's kind of
a long drive up here.

27:10.337 --> 27:12.374
- Mmm.<i>
- Where are you staying?</i>

27:12.464 --> 27:14.376
Uh, the Windmill.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.458
Windmill.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.381
The girl
is looking to party,

27:19.471 --> 27:22.339
and you tell her we're going
back to the motel and crash?

27:22.474 --> 27:24.340
- Jesus, Miles!
- Well, I'm tired, Jack.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.889
- Aren't you tired?
- The chick digs you, man!

27:26.979 --> 27:28.891
She lit up
like a pinball machine...

27:28.981 --> 27:31.394
when she found out your
novel was getting published.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.850
Now I have another lie
to live down.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.899
- Thanks, Jack.
- Just trying to get you a little action.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.402
I would appreciate
a little bit of help.

27:39.491 --> 27:42.905
Didn't seem to me like that's what
was going on. You were all over her.

27:42.995 --> 27:45.408
Well, somebody
had to do the talking.

27:45.497 --> 27:48.365
And, by the way, I was right...
she's not married.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.583
- How do you know?
- No rock.

27:50.669 --> 27:54.333
When she came to the bar,
she was sans rock.

27:55.632 --> 27:57.624
Oh.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.237
What's the plan
for today, Miles?

28:19.323 --> 28:21.235
Aha.

28:21.325 --> 28:23.942
Good.
Um, we head up north...

28:24.036 --> 28:25.948
Begin the grape tour
up there,

28:26.038 --> 28:27.950
work our way south...

28:28.040 --> 28:29.952
so that the more we drink,

28:30.042 --> 28:32.125
the closer we get
to the motel.

28:35.923 --> 28:38.461
What's your problem?

28:44.223 --> 28:46.180
What is it?

28:48.435 --> 28:51.348
I'm going to get my nut
on this trip, Miles,

28:51.438 --> 28:54.351
and you are not gonna
fuck it up for me...

28:54.441 --> 28:59.061
with all of your depression and
anxiety and neg-head downer shit.

28:59.154 --> 29:01.020
Oh.

29:01.114 --> 29:04.152
Well, now the cards
are on the table.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.109
Yes, they are.

29:06.245 --> 29:09.738
- Ah.<i>
- And I am serious. Do not fuck with me, Miles.</i>

29:09.831 --> 29:14.542
I am going to get laid before I get
married on Saturday. Do you read me?

29:16.004 --> 29:17.916
Sure, big guy.
Absolutely.

29:18.006 --> 29:19.918
Loud and clear.
Whatever you say.

29:20.008 --> 29:22.250
<i>It's, uh, your party,
evidently.</i>

29:22.344 --> 29:24.256
<i>Why don't you
just, uh...</i>

29:24.346 --> 29:28.260
Uh, yeah. Why don't you just go out,
and I'll catch a train back.

29:28.350 --> 29:30.262
No, Miles!

29:30.352 --> 29:32.844
Man, this is our week
to get crazy.

29:32.938 --> 29:34.850
We should both
be cutting loose.

29:34.940 --> 29:38.809
<i>This could be our last chance.
This is our week, man.</i>

29:40.237 --> 29:42.604
It's something
we should share.

30:15.439 --> 30:18.147
<i>This is our Syrah.</i>

30:18.233 --> 30:20.225
Okay.

30:21.737 --> 30:23.603
- Ooh!
- Yeah? Like that?

30:23.697 --> 30:25.563
That's a big one.

30:34.624 --> 30:38.038
<i>But it did sit with the skins for
about two weeks in an open-topped tank.</i>

30:38.170 --> 30:41.538
- So that would explain all the tannins, no?
- Well, it is a young wine.

30:41.673 --> 30:45.166
- So as the wine ages, the tannins will dissipate.
- Right. Of course.

30:45.302 --> 30:48.170
- Excuse me for just a minute.
- Good stuff.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.798
Mmm.
Fill up there, bub.

31:16.166 --> 31:18.408
<i>This is our estate chardonnay.</i>

31:18.502 --> 31:21.620
Now, there's a girl who knows how to pour.
What's your name?

31:21.713 --> 31:23.625
Stephanie.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.707
Stephanie.
Nice.

31:27.511 --> 31:29.423
So, what do you think?

31:29.513 --> 31:31.425
Mmm.
Quaffable.

31:31.515 --> 31:33.757
But, uh, far
from transcendent.

31:33.850 --> 31:35.762
I like it.
Tastes great.

31:35.852 --> 31:37.764
Oak-y.

31:37.854 --> 31:39.720
This is a cabernet franc.

31:39.815 --> 31:42.728
This is only the fifth year
we've made this varietal.

31:42.818 --> 31:45.401
Very few wineries around here
do a straight cab franc.

31:45.487 --> 31:47.399
It's from our vineyards
up in Santa Maria,

31:47.489 --> 31:50.402
<i>and it was
a silver medal winner...</i>

31:50.492 --> 31:52.404
at Paso Robles last year.

31:52.494 --> 31:55.077
Hmm.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.120
Mmm.

31:57.207 --> 31:59.119
Well, I will
tell you something.

31:59.209 --> 32:02.577
I've come never to expect greatness from a
cab franc, and this one is no different.

32:02.671 --> 32:05.584
It's kind of a hollow,
flabby, overripe...

32:05.674 --> 32:08.087
I don't know.
Tastes pretty good to me.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.543
So, um, do you live
around here, Stephanie?

32:10.637 --> 32:14.221
Yeah, up around Los Alamos.
And I agree with you about cab franc.

32:14.307 --> 32:16.720
We're just over
in Buellton.

32:16.810 --> 32:18.676
The Windmill Inn.

32:18.812 --> 32:20.724
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm.

32:20.814 --> 32:23.727
Do you happen to know a gal named
Maya that works at The Hitching Post?

32:23.817 --> 32:26.730
- Yeah. Sure. I know Maya. I know her real well.
- Yeah? No shit?

32:26.820 --> 32:29.358
We had a drink with her last night.
Miles knows her.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.360
Yes. Could we move on
to the Syrah, please?

32:31.450 --> 32:33.362
Oh.
Champing at the bit, huh?

32:33.452 --> 32:35.444
Sure.

32:36.621 --> 32:39.364
This is our estate Syrah.

32:42.169 --> 32:45.412
You are a bad, bad girl,
Stephanie.

32:45.505 --> 32:48.498
I know.
I need to be spanked.

32:49.718 --> 32:51.710
Excuse me.

32:54.055 --> 32:56.047
The Syrah?

33:05.108 --> 33:07.851
Hey. Hey.
Get the trunk.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.852
- You have the keys.
- I do?

33:09.988 --> 33:11.854
- Yeah.
- In my pocket.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.902
- So, we're on.
- What?

33:13.992 --> 33:18.032
Yeah. She called Maya, who's not working
tonight. So we're all going out.

33:18.163 --> 33:20.075
- Wi... With Maya?
- Yeah.

33:20.165 --> 33:22.578
She's been divorced
a year now, buddy.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.579
This chick Stephanie?

33:24.669 --> 33:27.582
She's got it all
goin' on.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.584
Well, she is cute,
yeah.

33:29.674 --> 33:31.586
Cute?
She's a fuckin' hottie.

33:31.676 --> 33:35.545
And you almost tell her that I'm gettin'
married? What's the matter with you?

33:47.526 --> 33:49.438
<i>- Nice, huh?
- It's beautiful.</i>

33:49.528 --> 33:52.646
<i>Yeah. Victoria and I
used to like this view.</i>

33:53.865 --> 33:55.777
<i>You know, once
we had a picnic here...</i>

33:55.867 --> 33:58.200
<i>and we drank
a '95 Opus One.</i>

33:58.286 --> 34:01.779
<i>With smoked salmon and artichokes.
But we didn't care.</i>

34:01.873 --> 34:06.618
Oh, man, she has the best palate
of any woman I have ever known.

34:06.711 --> 34:10.580
She can even differentiate all
different kinds of Italian wines.

34:11.967 --> 34:15.380
Miles, there's something I gotta tell you.

34:15.469 --> 34:17.587
Victoria's
coming to the wedding.

34:17.681 --> 34:21.094
Yeah, I know. You told me.
I'm all right with it.

34:21.184 --> 34:23.801
Yeah, but that's not
the whole story.

34:24.853 --> 34:26.766
She got remarried.

34:26.856 --> 34:28.848
She what?

34:30.527 --> 34:32.438
When?

34:32.529 --> 34:35.067
About a month ago.

34:35.156 --> 34:37.068
Maybe six weeks.

34:37.158 --> 34:40.993
To that guy... that guy
with the restaurant?

34:49.379 --> 34:51.291
Miles?

34:51.380 --> 34:53.373
Miles.

34:55.844 --> 34:57.756
I'd like
to go home now.

34:57.846 --> 34:59.758
Miles,
get out of the car.

34:59.848 --> 35:02.261
Would you drive me
back to the motel, please?

35:02.350 --> 35:04.262
You know...

35:04.352 --> 35:06.765
She bringing him
to the wedding?

35:06.855 --> 35:08.847
<i>What do you think?</i>

35:10.066 --> 35:12.979
Why didn't you tell me
about this before, Jack?

35:13.069 --> 35:16.904
<i>Because I knew you'd get so freaked out
that you wouldn't even come on this trip.</i>

35:16.990 --> 35:19.903
But then I thought,
this is the perfect place to tell you.

35:19.993 --> 35:23.282
We're here to forget about all that shit.
We're here to party, man.

35:23.371 --> 35:25.283
I'm gonna be
a fucking pariah.

35:25.373 --> 35:27.285
Persona non grata.

35:27.375 --> 35:31.915
Everybody's gonna be holding their breath,
waiting to see if I get drunk and make a scene.

35:32.005 --> 35:34.713
No, no. No. Look.

35:34.799 --> 35:37.086
I talked to Victoria.
Okay?

35:37.177 --> 35:39.089
<i>She's cool.
Everybody's cool.</i>

35:39.179 --> 35:41.671
I'm sorry.
You've been talking...

35:42.724 --> 35:44.636
Behind my back...

35:44.726 --> 35:46.718
you've been talking
about it?

35:48.396 --> 35:50.308
What are you doing?

35:50.398 --> 35:52.606
Come back here.

35:52.692 --> 35:54.684
Miles!

35:56.780 --> 35:59.648
<i>- Come here. Give me that bottle.</i>
- Back off, Jack.

35:59.783 --> 36:01.740
- Come on.
- Back off, man!

36:02.911 --> 36:04.903
- Give me that bottle.
- No.

36:06.706 --> 36:08.698
Miles.

36:09.876 --> 36:11.868
Miles!

37:17.986 --> 37:21.900
<i>A lot of people
out there think they can make it.</i>

37:21.990 --> 37:25.904
<i>What better thing in life is to chase the
dream and not be afraid of going after it?</i>

37:25.994 --> 37:30.409
James Lepp next to play.
Chance for a birdie and a five-shot lead.

37:30.498 --> 37:35.334
I'm gonna go for a swim,
get the blood flowing. You wanna come?

37:35.420 --> 37:37.958
No. I wanna watch this.

37:38.047 --> 37:40.460
Okay.

37:40.550 --> 37:45.011
<i>Should start this ball one or two
inches outside the left edge.</i>

37:47.390 --> 37:49.256
Go in.

37:50.852 --> 37:54.766
- Great putt.
- Absolutely. Great speed.

37:57.859 --> 38:01.023
<i>Miles.</i>

38:02.030 --> 38:04.192
Miles.

38:04.282 --> 38:07.366
Oh, Miles.
Time to get up.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.202
This fuckin' chick
in theJacuzzi...

38:14.292 --> 38:16.204
Oh, dude!

38:16.294 --> 38:20.129
This place is wide open.
I'm goin' fuckin' nuts up here, man.

38:20.256 --> 38:22.873
- Hey, what should I wear?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

38:22.967 --> 38:25.926
Something casual, but nice.
They think you're a writer.

38:26.012 --> 38:28.095
Right. Okay.

38:28.181 --> 38:30.218
Mmm.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.723
Do you have any other shoes?

38:34.813 --> 38:36.645
Uh-uh.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.723
Hmm.

38:45.740 --> 38:47.652
<i>Hey, honey.</i>

38:47.742 --> 38:50.155
<i>Yeah, I was just calling
to check in.</i>

38:50.245 --> 38:53.158
Miles and I are getting ready
to go to dinner.

38:53.248 --> 38:56.412
Probably stay out late, so I just
thought I'd call and say good night now.

38:56.501 --> 38:59.335
<i>Yeah.
I miss you too.</i>

38:59.420 --> 39:02.413
<i>Yeah.
I love you too.</i>

39:03.633 --> 39:06.296
Just try to be your normal,
humorous self. Okay?

39:06.386 --> 39:09.299
The guy you were before the tailspin.
Do you remember that guy?

39:09.389 --> 39:11.301
People love that guy.

39:11.391 --> 39:14.304
And don't forget...
your novel is coming out in the fall.

39:14.394 --> 39:17.307
Oh. Really? How exciting.
What's it called?

39:17.397 --> 39:19.389
Come here, Miles.
Come here.

39:23.945 --> 39:25.857
Do not sabotage me.

39:25.947 --> 39:28.860
If you wanna be a fuckin' lightweight,
then that's your call.

39:28.950 --> 39:31.863
- But do not sabotage me.
- Oh, aye, aye, cap'n. You got it.

39:31.953 --> 39:34.866
And if they wanna drink merlot,
we're drinkin' merlot.

39:34.956 --> 39:38.370
If anybody orders merlot, I'm leaving.
I am <i>not</i> drinking any fucking merlot!

39:38.459 --> 39:40.872
Okay, okay.
Relax, Miles.

39:40.962 --> 39:42.874
Jesus.
No merlot.

39:42.964 --> 39:45.126
Did you bring
your Xanax?

39:46.801 --> 39:48.713
All right.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.715
Come here.

39:50.805 --> 39:53.388
Do not drink too much.
Do you hear me?

39:53.474 --> 39:56.342
I don't want you passing out
or going to the dark side.

39:56.477 --> 39:59.311
- No going to the dark side!
- Okay!

40:03.359 --> 40:06.272
Hi. Just looking
for some friends.

40:17.832 --> 40:19.744
Good evening, ladies.
How are you?

40:19.834 --> 40:21.746
- Hi, Miles.<i>
- Good. How are you?</i>

40:21.836 --> 40:25.204
Hello, Maya.

40:25.340 --> 40:28.208
- You look gorgeous. You both do.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

40:28.343 --> 40:30.960
- You're not so bad yourself.
- Thanks. Thanks.

40:31.054 --> 40:32.920
<i>So, what's good here?</i>

40:33.056 --> 40:36.265
- What is this you're drinking?
- Oh, this is the Fiddlehead sauvignon blanc.

40:36.392 --> 40:39.351
- Ah, I see. Is it good?
- Try it.

40:39.479 --> 40:42.347
- What time did you close up at Ka... Is it...
- Kalyra.

40:42.482 --> 40:46.567
- Kalyra.
- I actually got out of there pretty good, around 5:30, 6:00.

40:46.653 --> 40:49.521
<i>- Still had some stuff to do.
- Miles and I, we were...</i>

40:49.656 --> 40:52.023
- That's nice.
- It's aged 12 months in oak.

40:52.158 --> 40:54.070
- French oak.
- Sauvignon blanc?

40:54.160 --> 40:56.072
Huh. Interesting.
It's good.

40:56.162 --> 40:59.280
I know the winemaker.
She comes into the restaurant all the time.

40:59.415 --> 41:02.579
- What do you have to do to close up?
- I close up the register.

41:02.669 --> 41:06.834
Clean up, put some stuff away.
Then put the glasses out for the next day.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.957
- Right.
- Just... Small stuff.

41:09.050 --> 41:10.916
<i>Uh, hints of clove.</i>

41:11.052 --> 41:12.964
- Right?
- Yes! I know. I love that.

41:13.054 --> 41:15.296
Yeah. Mmm.

41:15.390 --> 41:17.256
Sorry. It's good.

41:17.392 --> 41:19.679
- No, no. We'll get you a glass.
- Ah! Now we're thinking.

41:19.769 --> 41:21.681
Good.
Okay.

41:21.771 --> 41:23.683
<i>Oh, that's... that...</i>

41:23.773 --> 41:26.516
Oh, he can say it,
and it's not disgusting?

41:26.609 --> 41:28.521
I didn't hear him say that.

41:28.611 --> 41:33.026
- Whenever I say something he said...
- Very good.

41:33.116 --> 41:35.529
No, actually... No. That one.
N-Not this one...

41:38.162 --> 41:40.905
<i>I'm having that too.</i>

41:41.040 --> 41:43.248
- Right?
- Oh, yes.

41:43.334 --> 41:44.950
That's what I'm saying.

41:45.044 --> 41:46.956
<i>For our soup
we ha ve corn chowder,</i>

41:47.046 --> 41:50.460
<i>and for our entrees we ha ve medallions
of pork dusted with black truffles...</i>

41:50.550 --> 41:53.634
served with a root vegetable <i>foulon</i>
and wasabi whipped potatoes.

41:53.720 --> 41:55.586
<i>And finally...</i>

41:55.722 --> 41:58.635
<i>- I have to explain my credentials.
- Yes!</i>

41:58.725 --> 42:01.058
<i>Miles, what does this
remind you of?</i>

42:01.144 --> 42:04.057
"Red wine. Red wine."

42:04.147 --> 42:07.481
<i>He was brought up
on a lot of charges.</i>

42:09.027 --> 42:11.440
- Yeah?
- I mean, with the yellow light.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.441
Right.

42:13.531 --> 42:16.399
<i>After all, tonight we are celebrating
Miles's book deal.</i>

42:16.534 --> 42:18.446
- Published author.
- Oh! Wow!

42:18.536 --> 42:20.152
<i>Wow, Miles!</i>

42:20.246 --> 42:22.408
<i>- Ohh!
- Well, in that case...</i>

42:31.674 --> 42:35.884
And then they think you have no idea.
You have no control over it.

42:40.183 --> 42:42.095
<i>Ancient way
of treating the grape.</i>

42:42.185 --> 42:45.303
<i>Now it's a modern way
of treating the grape.</i>

42:45.396 --> 42:49.686
It's a traditional way of dealing with wine.
It's a controversial way.

42:49.776 --> 42:52.439
<i>So everyone's
going back to that.</i>

43:02.914 --> 43:05.782
It's just that there's
a certain constant lapping.

43:05.917 --> 43:08.830
- It's not a... It's a fishing lake.
- Mm-hmm.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.832
Your lips look soft.

43:12.924 --> 43:15.837
- The whole area is...
- Oh, no. You mean, like, what it was used for?

43:15.927 --> 43:18.920
What do they call the...

43:23.559 --> 43:26.518
Malibu...
It's Malibu Canyon.

43:29.774 --> 43:32.642
I don't know what the hell
I'm trying to say.

44:05.184 --> 44:07.096
<i>Hello?</i>

44:07.186 --> 44:09.178
Victoria?

44:10.982 --> 44:12.894
Miles?

44:12.984 --> 44:16.477
Well, well, well, well, well.
Victoria. How the hell are ya?

44:17.905 --> 44:20.613
What... Uh...
What's on your mind?

44:20.700 --> 44:22.612
Oh, nothin'. I...

44:22.702 --> 44:24.910
Just heard that
you got remarried.

44:24.996 --> 44:27.204
Congratulations.
I, uh...

44:27.290 --> 44:30.203
Boy, I didn't think you had the
stomach for another go-around.

44:30.293 --> 44:32.205
Oh, Miles,
you're drunk.

44:32.295 --> 44:35.208
Oh, just a little
local pinot, you know.

44:35.298 --> 44:39.167
A little burgundy. That old CÃ´tes de Beaune.

44:39.302 --> 44:42.716
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- Uh, a little place in Los Olivos.

44:42.805 --> 44:45.718
New owners.
Cozy ambience, uh...

44:45.808 --> 44:49.017
Excellent food too.
You should, uh... You should try it.

44:49.103 --> 44:53.438
I thought of you at the, uh,
Hitching Post last night.

44:55.276 --> 44:57.188
Hello?

44:57.278 --> 44:59.486
- Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
- No, it's...

44:59.572 --> 45:02.406
All right, I just...
I wanted to let you know...

45:02.491 --> 45:06.405
that I have decided
not to come to the wedding,

45:06.495 --> 45:12.082
so just in case you were dreading some sort
of, you know, run-in or something like that,

45:12.168 --> 45:14.080
well, you worry no more,

45:14.170 --> 45:16.082
because I'm not
gonna be there.

45:16.172 --> 45:19.711
It's my little wedding gift
to you and what's-his-name.

45:19.800 --> 45:22.133
What is his name?

45:23.346 --> 45:25.258
<i>Ken.</i>

45:25.348 --> 45:27.260
Ken! Right.

45:27.350 --> 45:29.262
Ken.

45:29.352 --> 45:31.264
I'm gonna
hang up now, Miles.

45:31.354 --> 45:34.722
No... You know, it's just...
I-I-I heard about this...

45:34.815 --> 45:37.478
for the first time, uh, today.

45:37.568 --> 45:39.480
Uh, your getting remarried,
that is.

45:39.570 --> 45:43.985
And, uh, I was
kind of taken aback.

45:44.075 --> 45:47.159
Just... Hard to believe.

45:49.747 --> 45:53.206
I guess I thought maybe
there was still a chance...

45:53.292 --> 45:55.204
for us
somewhere down the road.

45:55.294 --> 45:57.661
And I just, uh...

45:57.797 --> 45:59.709
- Miles.
- Huh?

45:59.799 --> 46:02.712
Maybe it is better if you don't come
to the wedding.

46:05.471 --> 46:08.384
All righty, Vicki.
Whatever you say.

46:08.474 --> 46:10.466
You're the boss.

46:20.820 --> 46:23.278
Huh?
I don't know.

46:23.364 --> 46:26.152
Welcome back.

46:26.242 --> 46:28.154
Take it easy.

46:30.329 --> 46:32.992
- Are you okay, Miles?
- Yes. I'm fine.

46:33.082 --> 46:35.074
Thank you.

46:38.671 --> 46:40.958
- Excuse us, gentlemen.
- Excuse us.

46:41.048 --> 46:42.914
<i>Sure.</i>

46:43.050 --> 46:45.417
- Mmm.
- All right.

46:45.511 --> 46:47.878
Yeah.
Don't take too long.

46:48.014 --> 46:51.428
- All right.
- Okay. Bye, girls.

46:51.517 --> 46:54.055
What the fuck?
What is up with you?

46:54.186 --> 46:56.052
- You remember our little talk outside?
- Yeah...

46:56.188 --> 46:59.226
- Get your shit together, Miles.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

46:59.317 --> 47:00.933
Where were you?

47:01.027 --> 47:03.064
Bathroom.

47:04.155 --> 47:06.067
Did you drink and dial?

47:06.157 --> 47:07.773
Hmm?

47:07.908 --> 47:10.241
- No.
- Why do you always have to do this?

47:10.328 --> 47:12.695
Victoria is gone.
Gone.

47:12.788 --> 47:15.201
Poof! In the wind.

47:15.291 --> 47:18.409
I mean, you are blowing a great
opportunity here with Maya.

47:18.502 --> 47:20.414
Maya... Fuckin' Maya...
She's great!

47:20.504 --> 47:23.417
She's cool, she's funny,
she knows wine.

47:23.507 --> 47:25.840
What is this morose,
come-down bullshit?

47:25.926 --> 47:28.339
These girls
wanna party with us.

47:28.429 --> 47:30.512
Huh?

47:30.598 --> 47:33.716
And what was that 10-minute lecture on,
what, Vouvrays?

47:33.809 --> 47:36.517
Are you kidding me?
Who gives a fuck?

47:36.604 --> 47:39.938
Let's just say that I'm uncomfortable
with the whole scenario.

47:40.024 --> 47:42.937
Have you forgotten all the bad
times you had with Victoria,

47:43.027 --> 47:45.565
how small
she could make you feel?

47:45.654 --> 47:48.567
Isn't that why you had the affair
with Brenda in the first place?

47:48.657 --> 47:50.569
Shut up. Shut your face.
Shut up.

47:50.659 --> 47:52.776
Have you even noticed
how Maya's looking at you?

47:52.870 --> 47:55.783
Now, come on, man.
You've got her on the hook.

47:55.873 --> 47:58.206
Reel her in.
Let's ratchet this up a notch.

47:58.292 --> 48:02.036
Here.
Drink some <i>agua fria.</i>

48:04.090 --> 48:06.582
Hey!

48:06.717 --> 48:08.629
- Hey!
- Mmm.

48:08.719 --> 48:13.214
Ah. Well, so, uh,
shall we get some dessert?

48:13.307 --> 48:17.221
Uh, well, we were thinking, um, uh,
why don't we go back to my place?

48:17.311 --> 48:20.054
I've got wine, some insane cheeses,
music, whatever.

48:20.147 --> 48:22.059
Yeah!

48:24.151 --> 48:27.485
Waiter!

48:41.585 --> 48:43.497
Come here.

48:43.587 --> 48:45.453
Uh-huh.

48:45.589 --> 48:47.831
- One for you, three for me.
- Mmm.

48:49.051 --> 48:50.963
You sure
you wanna do this?

48:57.560 --> 48:59.472
- We're here!
<i>- Hey!</i>

48:59.562 --> 49:01.929
- Hey!
- Where were you guys?

49:02.022 --> 49:06.266
Oh, we took a couple of wrong turns,
thanks to Magellan here.

49:06.360 --> 49:08.352
- Hi.
- Hi.

49:08.487 --> 49:10.353
- Oh, Miles.
- Yeah?

49:10.489 --> 49:13.357
- Maya's in the back, just past the kitchen.
- Okay.

49:13.492 --> 49:15.404
Thanks.

49:24.420 --> 49:26.332
Hi.

49:26.422 --> 49:28.414
Hey.

49:28.549 --> 49:31.337
- Oh, has she got anything good? <i>
- Oh, yeah.</i>

49:31.427 --> 49:34.295
<i>Steph's way into
pinots and Syrahs.</i>

49:34.388 --> 49:36.300
- Hey, Steph!
<i>- Yeah?</i>

49:36.390 --> 49:40.225
- Can we really open anything we want? <i>
- Yeah, yeah. Anything.</i>

49:40.311 --> 49:42.644
<i>Uh, except
the Richebourg.</i>

49:42.730 --> 49:46.189
Richebourg? She has a Richebourg?
Holy mackerel.

49:46.275 --> 49:48.187
<i>I've completely
underestimated Stephanie.</i>

49:48.277 --> 49:51.566
<i>Oh, good Lord.
Um, look at that.</i>

49:53.657 --> 49:57.822
<i>I think...
this guy's more our speed.</i>

49:57.912 --> 49:59.824
Andrew Murray.

49:59.914 --> 50:02.372
Well, okay.
All right.

50:04.960 --> 50:07.873
So, what gems do you have
in your collection?

50:07.963 --> 50:11.127
Oh, it's really not much
of a collection, you know.

50:11.217 --> 50:14.085
I mean, more like a small gathering
in a cabinet.

50:14.220 --> 50:17.133
No,
I've never really had the wallet for that.

50:17.223 --> 50:19.636
I just have to live
bottle to bottle.

50:19.725 --> 50:22.138
I've got things
I'm saving, definitely.

50:22.228 --> 50:26.643
I guess the star would be
a 1961 Cheval Blanc.

50:26.732 --> 50:29.600
You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc,
and it's just sitting there?

50:29.735 --> 50:31.601
- Yes, I do.
- Go get it.

50:31.737 --> 50:33.649
- Okay.
- I'm serious! Hurry!

50:33.739 --> 50:35.651
All right.
I would, I would.

50:35.741 --> 50:38.734
The '61s are peaking right now, aren't they?
That's what I've read.

50:38.827 --> 50:40.739
No, that's right, yeah.

50:40.829 --> 50:43.742
<i>It might be too late already.
What are you waiting for?</i>

50:43.832 --> 50:47.701
Oh, I don't know. A special occasion
with the right person.

50:47.836 --> 50:52.171
- It was supposed to be for my 10th wedding anniversary, but...<i>
- Mmm.</i>

50:52.258 --> 50:55.547
<i>You know, the day you open
a '61 Cheval Blanc,</i>

50:55.636 --> 50:57.628
<i>that's</i>
the special occasion.

51:00.641 --> 51:04.055
So, uh, how long
have you been into wine?

51:04.144 --> 51:07.012
I got serious
about seven years ago.

51:07.106 --> 51:10.395
- And what was the bottle that did it?
- '88 Sassicaia.

51:10.526 --> 51:12.813
<i>- Ah! Well, congratulations.</i>
- Mmm.

51:12.945 --> 51:14.811
- Yeah.
- That's very good.

51:14.947 --> 51:17.234
- Well...
- That would do it. Yeah.

51:17.324 --> 51:19.236
Hmm.

51:19.326 --> 51:21.318
Mmm.

51:23.706 --> 51:25.914
Oh, wow, that's nice.
That's very good.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.913
We need to give it a minute,
but that's really tasty.

51:29.003 --> 51:30.995
How about you?

51:34.049 --> 51:35.961
I think
they overdid it a little.

51:36.051 --> 51:38.384
Too much alcohol.
It overwhelms the fruit.

51:38.470 --> 51:40.462
Huh.

51:44.518 --> 51:46.430
Yeah. Yeah.

51:46.520 --> 51:48.933
I'd say
you're right on the money.

51:49.023 --> 51:51.390
Very good.
Nice.

51:51.525 --> 51:53.517
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

51:54.903 --> 51:57.816
Mmm!
Is that Stephanie's kid?

51:57.906 --> 51:59.772
Oh. Yeah.
That's Siena.

51:59.908 --> 52:02.742
- Oh, she's a sweetie.
<i>- Cute. Cute.</i>

52:02.828 --> 52:04.740
Where is she?

52:04.830 --> 52:06.742
<i>- She's at hergrandmother's.
- Oh.</i>

52:06.832 --> 52:09.074
<i>Steph's mom.
She spends a lot of time over there.</i>

52:09.168 --> 52:11.080
You got kids?

52:11.170 --> 52:13.036
Uh, me? No. No.

52:13.172 --> 52:16.586
No, I'd just fuck 'em up.

52:16.675 --> 52:21.261
No, that was the one unpolluted part
of my divorce... no kids.

52:21.347 --> 52:23.259
Yeah.
Same here.

52:23.349 --> 52:25.261
Good.

52:25.351 --> 52:27.343
Let's go in there.

52:29.229 --> 52:33.473
<i>Now, for a low, low
4.8% A.P.R. financing...</i>

52:44.703 --> 52:47.571
Looks like our friends
are really hitting it off.

52:47.706 --> 52:50.073
Yeah, I would say that.

52:50.209 --> 52:52.622
Yeah.

52:52.753 --> 52:55.666
So, what's your novel about?

52:55.756 --> 52:57.668
What's my...
Oh, brother.

52:57.758 --> 53:01.172
Well, it's, uh...
it's difficult to summarize.

53:01.261 --> 53:03.173
Um...

53:03.263 --> 53:06.176
It starts out as a kind of
first-person narrative...

53:06.266 --> 53:09.509
about a guy taking care of his father
after a stroke.

53:09.645 --> 53:12.888
- Oh.
- It's kind of based on, uh, personal experience.

53:12.981 --> 53:14.893
But only...
only loosely.

53:14.983 --> 53:16.895
What's the title?

53:16.985 --> 53:18.897
<i>The Day After Yesterday.</i>

53:18.987 --> 53:21.445
Oh.
You mean today.

53:23.450 --> 53:27.034
Um... Uh, yeah.
I mean, r-right. But it's more...

53:27.121 --> 53:30.785
So it's about, like,
death and mortality, or...

53:30.874 --> 53:33.457
Uh, yeah...

53:33.544 --> 53:35.456
Y... Not really.

53:35.546 --> 53:38.459
I, uh... It de...
It jumps around a lot.

53:38.549 --> 53:41.383
That's what it's about, in a way.
You know what I mean?

53:41.468 --> 53:44.381
You start to see everything
from the point of view of the father.

53:44.471 --> 53:47.885
And, uh, a lot of
other things happen... parallel narratives.

53:47.975 --> 53:49.887
It's kind of a mess.

53:49.977 --> 53:52.890
And then, eventually,
the whole thing sort of evolves,

53:52.980 --> 53:54.892
or devolves,

53:54.982 --> 53:57.315
into this sort of
Robbe-Grillet mystery.

53:57.401 --> 53:59.313
You know?

53:59.403 --> 54:01.395
But no real resolution.

54:01.488 --> 54:03.855
- Wow.
- It...

54:03.949 --> 54:06.942
Well, I think it's really great
you're getting it published.

54:07.035 --> 54:10.028
Really. I mean, I know
how hard it is just to write it even.

54:10.122 --> 54:12.034
Yeah.

54:12.124 --> 54:15.288
I mean, like me, I've got this paper
due on Friday,

54:15.377 --> 54:18.290
and I'm freaked out about it,
just like in high school.

54:18.380 --> 54:20.463
- A paper, huh?
- Yeah.

54:20.549 --> 54:23.462
I'm going for a master's degree
in horticulture.

54:23.552 --> 54:25.885
Sorta chipping away on it.

54:26.013 --> 54:28.721
- Horticulture? Really?
- Mmm.

54:28.807 --> 54:31.845
I didn't even know
that there was a college here.

54:31.935 --> 54:35.349
Well, I commute to San Luis Obispo
twice a week.

54:35.439 --> 54:37.977
Horticulture?
Wow.

54:38.066 --> 54:41.059
So, do you want to work
in a winery or something?

54:42.154 --> 54:43.690
Maybe.

54:44.865 --> 54:46.857
Oh.

54:49.161 --> 54:51.073
Hmm.

54:51.163 --> 54:53.200
So, when can I
read your book?

54:55.292 --> 54:59.457
Well, I... You know, I... Well,
I do happen to have a manuscript in my car.

54:59.546 --> 55:01.378
Um, it's not proofed
or anything,

55:01.465 --> 55:03.627
so it's...
it's full of typos.

55:03.759 --> 55:06.376
- If you don't mind typos...
- Oh, no. Who cares?

55:06.470 --> 55:08.382
I'm the queen of typos.

55:08.472 --> 55:10.464
Okay.

55:41.004 --> 55:43.246
Mmm.

55:43.340 --> 55:45.332
Ahh.

55:47.135 --> 55:51.049
You know, can I ask you
a personal question, Miles?

55:51.139 --> 55:53.051
Sure.

55:53.141 --> 55:55.007
Why are you
so into pinot?

55:55.143 --> 55:58.352
I mean, it's like a thing with you.

55:59.356 --> 56:02.190
Uh... I don't know.
I don't know.

56:02.276 --> 56:06.520
Um... It's a hard grape
to grow.

56:06.613 --> 56:08.821
As you know. Right?

56:08.907 --> 56:11.194
It's, uh...
It's thin-skinned,

56:11.285 --> 56:14.073
temperamental,
ripens early.

56:15.205 --> 56:17.117
It's... You know,
it's not a survivor...

56:17.207 --> 56:19.119
like cabernet,

56:19.209 --> 56:21.121
which can just
grow anywhere...

56:21.211 --> 56:24.124
and thrive
even when it's neglected.

56:24.214 --> 56:27.924
No, pinot needs constant care and attention.
You know?

56:28.010 --> 56:30.423
And, in fact,
it can only grow...

56:30.512 --> 56:34.472
in these really specific,
little tucked-away corners of the world.

56:36.602 --> 56:38.514
And... And only...

56:38.604 --> 56:43.520
the most patient
and nurturing of growers...

56:43.609 --> 56:46.147
can do it, really.

56:46.236 --> 56:49.229
Only somebody
who really takes the time...

56:49.323 --> 56:53.192
to understand
pinot's potential...

56:53.285 --> 56:56.198
can then coax it
into its fullest expression.

56:56.288 --> 56:59.622
And then? I mean...

56:59.708 --> 57:02.872
Oh, its flavors, they're just the most
haunting and brilliant...

57:02.961 --> 57:06.545
and thrilling
and subtle and...

57:07.758 --> 57:10.592
ancient on the planet.

57:15.599 --> 57:18.512
No, I mean, you know,
cabernets can be powerful and exalting too,

57:18.602 --> 57:22.141
but they seem prosaic to me,
for some reason, by comparison.

57:22.272 --> 57:24.605
I don't know. I don't know.

57:24.691 --> 57:26.603
What about you?

57:26.693 --> 57:28.605
What about me?

57:28.695 --> 57:32.063
I don't know.
Why are you into wine?

57:33.659 --> 57:36.527
Oh, I...
I think I...

57:36.662 --> 57:40.076
- I originally got into wine through my ex-husband.
- Ah.

57:40.165 --> 57:44.000
You know, he had this big
sort of show-off cellar.

57:44.127 --> 57:46.039
- You know?
- Right.

57:46.129 --> 57:49.873
- But then I discovered that I had a really sharp palate.
- Mm-hmm.

57:49.967 --> 57:51.879
And the more I drank,

57:51.969 --> 57:54.928
the more I liked
what it made me think about.

57:55.013 --> 57:56.925
Like what?

57:57.015 --> 57:58.927
Like what a fraud he was.

57:59.017 --> 58:01.179
Wow.

58:01.269 --> 58:04.808
No, I mean,
I like to think about the life of wine.

58:04.898 --> 58:06.810
Yeah.

58:06.900 --> 58:08.892
How it's
a living thing.

58:10.612 --> 58:12.524
I like to think about...

58:12.614 --> 58:16.028
what was going on the year
the grapes were growing,

58:16.118 --> 58:18.485
how the sun was shining,

58:18.578 --> 58:20.570
if it rained.

58:21.748 --> 58:23.660
I like to think about...

58:23.750 --> 58:27.118
all the people who tended
and picked the grapes...

58:27.212 --> 58:31.707
and, if it's an old wine, how many of them
must be dead by now.

58:34.177 --> 58:37.420
<i>I like how wine
continues to evolve.</i>

58:37.514 --> 58:40.427
<i>Like, if I opened
a bottle of wine today,</i>

58:40.517 --> 58:44.557
<i>it would taste different than
if I'd opened it on any other day.</i>

58:44.646 --> 58:49.061
Because a bottle of wine
is actually alive...

58:49.151 --> 58:54.146
and it's constantly evolving
and gaining complexity.

58:55.657 --> 58:58.240
That is, until it peaks,

58:58.326 --> 59:00.283
like your '61.

59:01.580 --> 59:04.823
And then it begins
its steady,

59:04.916 --> 59:07.829
<i>inevitable decline.</i>

59:07.919 --> 59:10.457
Hmm.

59:11.548 --> 59:14.712
And it tastes
so fucking good.

59:32.527 --> 59:34.439
Yeah.

59:34.529 --> 59:37.112
But you know, I... I, uh...

59:37.199 --> 59:39.612
I like other wines
besides pinot too.

59:39.701 --> 59:42.444
I mean, lately I've been
really into Rieslings.

59:43.455 --> 59:45.742
You like Rieslings?
Rieslings?

59:45.832 --> 59:47.619
Mm-hmm.

59:50.170 --> 59:52.036
There's a bathroom
in the back?

59:52.172 --> 59:54.880
- Yeah. It's through the kitchen.
- I'll be right back.

01:00:07.813 --> 01:00:11.102
God,
you are such a fuckin' loser.

01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:14.275
You make me
so fuckin' sick.

01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:17.525
Oh, God. Ah, come on.

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:37.498
Hi.

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:39.591
- I was just getting some water.
- Okay.

01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:41.756
- You want some water?
- No.

01:00:41.847 --> 01:00:44.385
Okay. It's getting
kind of late.

01:00:53.733 --> 01:00:55.770
I should really go.

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:29.509
So you know how to get to the Windmill?
Two rights and a left.

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:31.560
- Got it.
- Okay.

01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:34.138
I had a nice time tonight, Miles.
I really did.

01:01:34.232 --> 01:01:37.100
Good. So did I.

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:42.275
- Okay. Well, I'll see you around then.
- Um...

01:01:43.783 --> 01:01:46.196
Did you still want
to read my novel?

01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:49.074
Oh, yeah. Of course.

01:01:53.919 --> 01:01:55.831
Yeah.

01:01:57.505 --> 01:01:59.918
- Great.
- Just a sec.

01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:06.049
- Here.
- Oh, wow.

01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:08.131
Well,
I hope you like it.

01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:12.970
And feel free to stop reading it any time.
I will not be offended.

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:15.180
Okay.

01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:17.978
- Well, good night, Miles.
- Good night.

01:03:04.155 --> 01:03:06.147
Oh, fuck.

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:16.290
Oh, fuck.

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:42.400
That fucking chick is unbelievable, dude.
Unbelievable!

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:44.772
Whoo! Boy.

01:03:44.863 --> 01:03:48.231
<i>Ohh, she is nasty,
Miles.</i>

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:51.409
<i>Nasty, nasty, nasty!</i>

01:03:51.536 --> 01:03:54.654
- Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system.
<i>- Yeah, baby.</i>

01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:57.707
Congratulations.
Mission accomplished.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.082
Oh, hi, Miles!

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:05.790
Hi.

01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:09.418
Hey, you didn't
invite Stephanie to come with us, did you?

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:11.504
Oh, listen, man.
Change of plans.

01:04:11.598 --> 01:04:15.558
Stephanie's off today, so, you know,
I'm thinkin' about goin' on a hike.

01:04:15.643 --> 01:04:18.056
We were supposed
to play golf.

01:04:18.146 --> 01:04:21.480
You know what? You go, man. You go.
In fact, use my clubs.

01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:24.646
<i>They're brand-new. They were
a gift from Christine's dad.</i>

01:04:24.736 --> 01:04:27.194
Here, I'll pay for it.
Right there.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:30.614
And then later, the three of us,
we can go to The Hitching Post.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.692
<i>We could sit at one
of Maya's tables.</i>

01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:34.698
<i>She'll bring us
some great wine, you know?</i>

01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:38.243
<i>- Then the four of us will do something.</i>
- No. Count me out.

01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:40.666
Oh, I see.

01:04:40.752 --> 01:04:43.415
Didn't go so great last night, huh?
What a shocker.

01:04:43.505 --> 01:04:47.249
<i>You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria
didn't put you in the mood?</i>

01:04:48.593 --> 01:04:51.176
Dumb fuck.

01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:55.799
- Later, man.
- Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.

01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:08.315
Oh, boy.

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:11.113
Yeah, she's been leaving
messages here too.

01:05:12.617 --> 01:05:14.483
Yeah. Okay.

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:17.862
- You should call her.
<i>- I will. I'll see you.</i>

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:20.614
- Right now!
- Okay. Fuck!

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.993
- What are you, my mom?
- Well.

01:05:32.554 --> 01:05:35.012
Would you mind
waiting outside?

01:05:40.353 --> 01:05:43.596
<i>- That was fun last night.</i>
- Yeah. Good food.

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:47.775
Hey, I-I talked to Maya this morning.
She said she had a fun time too.

01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:49.853
<i>You should call her.</i>

01:05:58.079 --> 01:06:01.197
- Where's Jack?
- Uh, had to make a phone call.

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:03.829
Oh.

01:06:05.712 --> 01:06:08.170
<i>Miles. Miles.</i>

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:14.339
Hey, man, uh, do you have
that other condom?

01:06:14.429 --> 01:06:16.796
In my jacket.

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:18.847
What did, uh,
Christine say?

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:23.177
Lucked out. Got voice mail.
Everything's cool.

01:06:23.271 --> 01:06:26.105
<i>- Ha, ha! Here I am.
- Hi!</i>

01:06:33.072 --> 01:06:35.064
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:07:23.206 --> 01:07:26.244
Cannonball!

01:07:26.334 --> 01:07:29.452
<i>Please
dial your password and press pound.</i>

01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:35.549
You have no messages
at this time.

01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:38.173
To send a message,
press 2...

01:08:08.001 --> 01:08:11.540
Uh...

01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:13.666
Not now. Not now!

01:08:13.798 --> 01:08:17.962
Yeah.

01:08:29.147 --> 01:08:31.104
Hey, there you are.

01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:33.682
- Yup.
- Hey, man.

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:36.063
What are you drinking?

01:08:36.154 --> 01:08:38.145
Is it any good?

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.573
Can... Can I get
a glass, please?

01:08:41.658 --> 01:08:44.618
Thanks.

01:08:44.703 --> 01:08:47.947
Stephanie took me out
to the pinot fields today, Miles.

01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:49.997
God, it was so awesome.

01:08:50.084 --> 01:08:53.417
I think I'm really starting to get a handle
on the whole process.

01:08:53.504 --> 01:08:56.087
The soil to the vine, and the...
What do you call it?

01:08:56.174 --> 01:08:58.381
The selection to the harvest.

01:08:58.468 --> 01:09:01.461
Then that thing they do with the
big containers where they mix it?

01:09:01.554 --> 01:09:03.841
It's really neat,
the whole thing.

01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:06.639
Then we ate pinot grapes
right off the vine.

01:09:06.725 --> 01:09:08.809
They were a little sour,

01:09:08.895 --> 01:09:11.638
but showing excellent potential
for structure...

01:09:11.731 --> 01:09:13.643
down the line,
I think.

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:16.897
Stephanie, man.
She really knows her shit.

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:19.478
Hmm.
Where is Stephanie?

01:09:19.572 --> 01:09:23.361
Uh, she's upstairs
cleaning up.

01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:25.613
What the fuck
are you doing?

01:09:27.246 --> 01:09:30.910
- What?
- With this chick.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.287
What?

01:09:33.377 --> 01:09:35.620
Does she know
about Saturday?

01:09:35.712 --> 01:09:38.171
Well, not exactly.
I've been honest with her.

01:09:38.256 --> 01:09:40.249
I haven't told her
I'm available.

01:09:40.343 --> 01:09:42.835
She knows this trip
is only for a few days.

01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:45.546
Besides, I just...

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:49.892
- Besides what?
- I'm... Well, you know...

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:52.011
- The wedding.
- What?

01:09:52.104 --> 01:09:57.021
I... I've just been
doing some thinking about it.

01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:59.944
Oh, you've been thinking.
And?

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:06.701
Might have to put
the wedding on hold is all.

01:10:06.786 --> 01:10:10.245
Look, I know that
that could be tricky...

01:10:10.373 --> 01:10:13.411
- for certain people to accept at first.
- Yeah.

01:10:13.501 --> 01:10:15.993
All right?
But life is short, Miles.

01:10:16.087 --> 01:10:20.047
I have to be sure I'm doing the right thing
before taking such a big step.

01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:22.625
You know what?
That's not just for my sake.

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:25.928
I'm looking out for
Christine's feelings too.

01:10:26.013 --> 01:10:29.848
I mean, being with Stephanie has
completely opened my eyes.

01:10:29.934 --> 01:10:32.722
She's not uptight or controlling.
She's just cool.

01:10:32.812 --> 01:10:36.351
I mean, she smells different,
she tastes different.

01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:38.474
- She fucks different.
- Okay.

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:40.901
She fucks
like an animal.

01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:44.105
I gotta tell you, man.

01:10:44.198 --> 01:10:47.362
I went deep last night.

01:10:47.452 --> 01:10:52.197
Deep.

01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:55.749
I thought I'd get a little understanding
from you, but I'm not gonna get that.

01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:58.327
Understanding
about what, Jack?

01:11:01.507 --> 01:11:04.124
I might be in love with another woman.

01:11:04.218 --> 01:11:06.130
In love? Really?

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:10.214
Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer
chick, and you're fuckin' in love.

01:11:10.308 --> 01:11:13.301
Come on! And you're gonna
give up everything?

01:11:15.521 --> 01:11:17.478
Here's what I'm thinkin'.

01:11:17.565 --> 01:11:21.024
You and me, we move up here,
we buy a vineyard.

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:24.603
You design the wine.
I'll handle the business side.

01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:27.781
You get inspired, maybe write another novel,
one that can sell.

01:11:27.867 --> 01:11:29.779
Oh, my God. No, no.

01:11:29.869 --> 01:11:32.236
As for me, if an audition comes up,
L.A.'s right there, man.

01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:34.863
- It's two hours away. Not even.
- Jesus Christ. You're crazy.

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:37.415
You've gone crazy.

01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:43.338
All I know is
that I'm an actor.

01:11:43.424 --> 01:11:46.087
All I have is my instinct.

01:11:47.929 --> 01:11:50.467
You're asking me
to go against it.

01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:53.924
<i>Hi, guys!</i>

01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:56.726
Hi. Hi.

01:11:56.854 --> 01:11:59.813
- We should probably get going.
- Yeah.

01:11:59.899 --> 01:12:02.061
Where?

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:05.144
<i>I know where all
the drivers go.</i>

01:12:05.238 --> 01:12:09.573
Huh? All right. Here comes the tricky part.
There you go. Nice.

01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:12.572
<i>Nice.
Okay, it's the bridge.</i>

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:16.531
<i>Golden Gate Bridge.
There you go.</i>

01:12:19.043 --> 01:12:21.956
You know, it's a thing... I mean,
I've gotten over it. You know what I mean?

01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:24.796
- Mm-hmm.
<i>- Stephanie's heard this a thousand times,</i>

01:12:24.882 --> 01:12:28.216
<i>but if I'd bought up in Santa Maria
when I had a chance,</i>

01:12:28.302 --> 01:12:31.215
I would've made a fortune
when they put in that, uh...

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:33.464
- Home Depot.
- Home Depot.

01:12:33.558 --> 01:12:36.392
And those stores.
And your father knew about it too.

01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:38.389
He's such a fuckin'
chickenshit.

01:12:38.479 --> 01:12:42.143
<i>Always was.
Just a fuckin' chickenshit.</i>

01:12:42.275 --> 01:12:44.608
<i>Just too scared.</i>

01:12:44.735 --> 01:12:47.728
<i>- Is this bothering you? You sure?</i>
- It's fine. Yeah.

01:12:50.449 --> 01:12:53.362
Hey, man. I'm gonna just make sure that
Siena and Stephanie get home safe.

01:12:53.494 --> 01:12:55.986
- Okay.
- All right. Maybe we'll hook up with you later.

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.493
Sure. Whatever.
Maybe I'll go catch a movie or something.

01:12:58.624 --> 01:13:01.492
- See you later, Miles.
- Thanks, Stephanie. See you.

01:13:01.627 --> 01:13:03.539
- Bye, Siena.
- Bye.

01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:05.996
- Caryl, very nice meeting you.
- I loved talking with you.

01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:10.001
- Thanks.
- If you go out later, call me on my cell.

01:13:10.094 --> 01:13:12.757
Okay!

01:13:24.317 --> 01:13:26.980
- Okay. That's it?
- Yeah.

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:30.858
Actually, could I get a, uh...
a <i>Barely Legal,</i> please?

01:13:30.948 --> 01:13:34.532
Thank you. No, actually...
Sorry. The new one.

01:13:34.619 --> 01:13:36.531
Okay.

01:13:37.663 --> 01:13:39.655
Thanks.

01:13:59.810 --> 01:14:02.473
What... Oh.

01:14:50.236 --> 01:14:53.729
- Hey, Miles. How's it hanging?
- Hey.

01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:56.907
Oh, you know me.
I love it up here.

01:14:57.034 --> 01:14:59.993
- How 'bout you?
- Busy for a Tuesday night.

01:15:00.079 --> 01:15:02.822
We had a busload of old folks
on a wine tour.

01:15:02.915 --> 01:15:05.908
Usually they're not too rowdy,
but tonight something was going on.

01:15:06.002 --> 01:15:08.961
I don't know. A full moon or something.
Anyway, what can I get you?

01:15:09.088 --> 01:15:11.796
- Highliner.
- Glass or bottle?

01:15:11.924 --> 01:15:15.133
- Bottle.
- You got it.

01:15:15.219 --> 01:15:17.506
Say, is, uh,
Maya working?

01:15:17.596 --> 01:15:20.930
Maya? Uh, no,
I haven't seen her.

01:15:21.017 --> 01:15:23.350
I think she's off tonight.

01:15:35.322 --> 01:15:38.315
- You okay, Miles?
- Yeah, I'm good.

01:16:16.113 --> 01:16:18.856
Ah, crap.

01:16:18.991 --> 01:16:21.734
- Did you ever get ahold of Maya yesterday?
- Nope.

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:23.739
- Hmm?
- No.

01:16:23.829 --> 01:16:26.446
She really likes you, man.
Stephanie'll tell you.

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:29.245
- Could you just give me a little room? Please?
- Yeah.

01:16:29.335 --> 01:16:31.247
Thank you.

01:16:31.337 --> 01:16:34.796
In life, you gotta strike while
the iron's hot. Iron is hot.

01:16:34.882 --> 01:16:37.499
Sage advice, Jack.

01:16:37.635 --> 01:16:40.378
- Now, remember, sit back on your heels.
- Mm-hmm.

01:16:40.471 --> 01:16:43.839
All right?
Turn through the abdomen.

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:46.391
Abdomen.

01:16:46.519 --> 01:16:49.136
- Oh, for cryin'...
- Nice.

01:16:49.230 --> 01:16:51.688
<i>What about your agent?
You hear anything yet?</i>

01:16:51.816 --> 01:16:54.729
<i>- Nope.
- What do you think's going on?</i>

01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:57.819
<i>- Could be anything.
- You been checking your messages?</i>

01:16:57.905 --> 01:17:00.613
- Obsessively.
- Huh.

01:17:00.699 --> 01:17:03.737
Guess I'll just have to learn to kiss off
another three years of my life.

01:17:03.828 --> 01:17:06.036
But you haven't heard
anything yet,

01:17:06.122 --> 01:17:09.706
so don't you think your negativity's
a little premature?

01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:13.706
Hmm? All right. You know, fuck
the New York publishers.

01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:16.288
Publish it yourself, Miles.
I'll chip in.

01:17:16.382 --> 01:17:19.216
Just get it out there.
Get it reviewed.

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:22.635
Get it in libraries.
Let the public decide.

01:17:28.519 --> 01:17:30.511
Don't come over the top.

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:32.888
- Stay still.
- Shut up.

01:17:33.941 --> 01:17:36.524
It's all about stillness.

01:17:36.652 --> 01:17:40.111
- Inner quiet.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!

01:17:40.197 --> 01:17:42.985
Jesus Christ, man!
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:17:43.075 --> 01:17:46.910
Please, just shut up!
Fuck!

01:17:47.037 --> 01:17:49.324
- God.
- What's with the hostility, man?

01:17:49.415 --> 01:17:51.953
I know you're a little
frustrated with your life right now,

01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:55.919
but you <i>can</i> choose to be less hostile.

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:02.000
The fucker hit into us.

01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:04.802
Hurry it up, will ya?

01:18:04.889 --> 01:18:08.223
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

01:18:08.309 --> 01:18:12.019
Hey, that's not cool,
asshole!

01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:26.942
<i>Nice shot. Jackoffs.</i>

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:31.246
- What the hell are you doing?
- Oops. Look out.

01:18:32.666 --> 01:18:35.454
<i>Uh? Uh-huh.</i>

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:39.163
Oh.
Oh, check it out.

01:18:39.298 --> 01:18:42.587
- This is gonna be fun. This is gonna be fun.
- Go to it.

01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:54.970
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool,
smart chicks like that require persistence.

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:57.556
I don't wanna talk
about it, please.

01:18:57.650 --> 01:19:00.267
All I know is that she's beautiful,
a lot of soul.

01:19:00.361 --> 01:19:02.353
She's perfect for you.

01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:05.735
I'm just not gonna feel good about this week
until I know you guys have hooked up.

01:19:05.824 --> 01:19:09.568
Don't you want to feel that cozy little box
grip down on your johnson?

01:19:09.662 --> 01:19:12.530
Hey! Mind keeping it
down, buddy?

01:19:12.623 --> 01:19:14.990
A woman finds out
how I live,

01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:18.452
that I'm not a published author,
that I'm a liar, essentially,

01:19:18.545 --> 01:19:22.129
any interest she has
is gonna evaporate real quick.

01:19:22.216 --> 01:19:25.880
If you don't have money at my age,
you're not even in the game anymore.

01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:29.554
You're just a pasture animal
waiting for the abattoir.

01:19:29.682 --> 01:19:33.642
- Abattoir. What is that?
- Slaughterhouse.

01:19:33.727 --> 01:19:36.765
Abattoir. Huh.
But you know what?

01:19:36.855 --> 01:19:38.847
You are gonna be
a published author...

01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:42.184
because you're gonna get the good news
this week about your book.

01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:47.902
Huh. Stephanie.

01:19:47.992 --> 01:19:50.780
Hey, honey. Yeah.

01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:53.327
Yeah. Yeah.

01:19:53.414 --> 01:19:55.371
Yeah!

01:20:00.004 --> 01:20:02.041
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:10.713
Hey, Miles. I heard you stopped
by the restaurant to see me last night.

01:20:10.806 --> 01:20:13.139
Oh, yeah. No.
I mean, uh, yeah.

01:20:13.225 --> 01:20:15.842
I stopped by for a drink.
I didn't see you.

01:20:15.978 --> 01:20:17.890
- I had class.
- Oh.

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:20.643
Well, nice to see you now.

01:20:20.733 --> 01:20:22.725
It's good to see you too.

01:20:31.035 --> 01:20:34.244
<i>Syrah.</i>

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:38.165
<i>Oldest Syrah grapes
in Santa Barbara County.</i>

01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:41.414
Did you know that?

01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:43.540
You didn't know that?

01:20:45.632 --> 01:20:48.750
<i>The pinot noir grape
has been cultivated perhaps...</i>

01:20:48.844 --> 01:20:52.212
<i>since antiquity
in Burgundy.</i>

01:20:52.306 --> 01:20:55.014
And it is precisely
this ancient...

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:58.389
and inherited
winemaking knowledge...

01:20:58.479 --> 01:21:01.096
<i>that has contributed
to its success.</i>

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:06.753
- I was, like, 16, 17.
- Really?

01:22:06.839 --> 01:22:09.001
Yeah.
I'm gonna die!

01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:11.549
- Oh, God. What a drag.
- Mom?

01:22:11.635 --> 01:22:13.501
- Oh.
- Oh, hey. Hi.

01:22:13.637 --> 01:22:16.596
Is it too loud?

01:22:16.682 --> 01:22:20.346
Sorry. Oh, UncleJack will
put you back to bed.

01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:22.428
Come here,
little sister. Ooh!

01:22:22.521 --> 01:22:25.434
We'll be more quiet,
okay?

01:22:25.566 --> 01:22:29.526
- Good night. I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

01:22:29.653 --> 01:22:33.021
My favorite, as far as ice cream...

01:22:33.157 --> 01:22:36.150
<i>- Chunky Monkey.
- Chunky Monkey!</i>

01:24:59.845 --> 01:25:02.963
You guys should come by the restaurant
for lunch today.

01:25:03.098 --> 01:25:06.591
- Great. What's the latest we can get there?
- About 2:30.

01:25:09.688 --> 01:25:12.476
<i>Did you hear about this Bordeaux
tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara...</i>

01:25:12.566 --> 01:25:14.478
on Saturday night?

01:25:14.568 --> 01:25:18.733
It's kind of pricey, but if you wanted to go,
I'd be into it.

01:25:18.822 --> 01:25:21.280
Why don't you just stay
for the weekend?

01:25:21.366 --> 01:25:24.609
No, we have to get back Friday
for the rehearsal dinner.

01:25:24.703 --> 01:25:26.695
What rehearsal dinner?

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.906
Who's getting married?

01:25:30.042 --> 01:25:34.252
- Were you ever gonna say anything?
<i>- Yes, of course I was.</i>

01:25:34.338 --> 01:25:36.751
Just now I could've told you
some story, but I didn't.

01:25:36.882 --> 01:25:40.796
- I told you the truth. Maya!
- Don't touch me!

01:25:40.886 --> 01:25:42.878
Just take me home.

01:25:44.431 --> 01:25:46.923
Do you have any idea
what he's been saying to her?

01:25:47.059 --> 01:25:50.803
- He's an actor, so it can't be good.
- Only that he loves her.

01:25:50.896 --> 01:25:55.015
How she's the only woman that's ever
rocked his world, how he adores Siena,

01:25:55.108 --> 01:25:59.443
how he wants to move here and get a place with
the two of them and commute when he has to.

01:25:59.529 --> 01:26:02.272
<i>I'm sure he believed
every word of it.</i>

01:26:02.366 --> 01:26:04.699
<i>Please believe me.</i>

01:26:04.785 --> 01:26:07.698
I was on the verge of
telling you last night, but...

01:26:07.788 --> 01:26:10.906
But you wanted
to fuck me first.

01:26:12.042 --> 01:26:14.830
Oh, Maya. No.

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:16.877
Yeah.

01:26:27.974 --> 01:26:31.593
You know, I've just spent
the last three years of my life...

01:26:31.687 --> 01:26:35.977
trying to extricate myself from
a relationship that was full of deception,

01:26:36.066 --> 01:26:38.058
and I'm doing just fine.

01:26:39.903 --> 01:26:44.523
And I haven't been with anybody
since my divorce,

01:26:44.616 --> 01:26:47.609
so this has been
a big deal for me, Maya.

01:26:47.703 --> 01:26:51.993
Hanging out with you
and, uh... and last night.

01:26:52.082 --> 01:26:55.416
I really like you, Maya,

01:26:55.502 --> 01:26:58.995
and I am not Jack.

01:26:59.089 --> 01:27:02.048
I'm... I'm...

01:27:02.134 --> 01:27:06.629
I'm his freshman year
roommate from San Diego State.

01:27:31.455 --> 01:27:34.414
There's my boy!

01:27:34.499 --> 01:27:37.458
There he is.
But who's your daddy?

01:27:37.586 --> 01:27:40.374
- Who is your daddy? Oh!
- Jack, come on.

01:27:40.505 --> 01:27:43.043
- Oh, let me love you.
- Let go. Oh!

01:27:43.175 --> 01:27:45.963
Let me down, Jack.

01:27:46.052 --> 01:27:49.011
I am so proud of you.
Ah. Mmm. Mmm.

01:27:49.139 --> 01:27:51.756
- Well, that's nice.
- Okay. All right. Details.

01:27:51.850 --> 01:27:54.718
- I love details.
- No.

01:27:54.853 --> 01:27:58.767
- What?
- Jesus. It's private.

01:27:58.857 --> 01:28:01.975
You better tell me what happened,
or I'll tie your dick in a knot.

01:28:02.068 --> 01:28:05.357
Let's just leave it,
okay?

01:28:05.489 --> 01:28:09.904
You didn't get any, did you?

01:28:10.035 --> 01:28:13.199
- You're a homo.
- Yeah, right. Yup, I'm a homo.

01:28:13.288 --> 01:28:15.200
Yeah. Yeah.

01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:17.782
Just make up whatever you want,
and that's what happened. Okay?

01:28:17.876 --> 01:28:21.620
Fine. Write out my gay confession,
and I'll sign it.

01:28:21.713 --> 01:28:25.377
Okay? Just stop pushing me
all the time.

01:28:25.467 --> 01:28:27.504
You're an infant, Jack.

01:28:27.636 --> 01:28:30.925
- <i>This is all a big party for you...</i>
- Okay.

01:28:31.056 --> 01:28:33.423
- <i>but not for me.</i>
- Come on.

01:28:33.517 --> 01:28:35.509
I'm sorry, man.

01:28:36.978 --> 01:28:39.391
Did you have trouble
performing?

01:28:41.399 --> 01:28:44.938
Yeah, that's it.

01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:48.063
Don't answer it.

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:50.022
Don't answer it.

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:53.572
<i>- Jack.</i>
- Hello.

01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:56.450
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:58.827
Uh-huh.
It's Christine.

01:28:58.917 --> 01:29:03.252
<i>Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh.</i>

01:29:03.338 --> 01:29:05.330
Hey, let me call you
right back.

01:29:05.423 --> 01:29:08.131
Miles and I are kinda
in the middle of something.

01:29:08.218 --> 01:29:12.679
<i>Nah, it's nothing serious. Just...
He's having one of his freak-outs. Yeah.</i>

01:29:16.685 --> 01:29:20.929
<i>This whole week has gone sour.
It hasn 't gone the way it was supposed to.</i>

01:29:21.022 --> 01:29:24.265
I just want to go home.

01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:28.398
I know what you need.

01:29:28.488 --> 01:29:30.946
How 'bout this one?
We didn't hit this one.

01:29:31.074 --> 01:29:33.612
- Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
- You ever actually been in there?

01:29:33.743 --> 01:29:38.078
- I don't have to.
- I say we check it out. We're right here.

01:30:12.991 --> 01:30:15.608
<i>It tastes like the back
of a fucking L.A. school bus.</i>

01:30:15.702 --> 01:30:18.160
Now, they probably
didn't de-stem,

01:30:18.246 --> 01:30:20.738
hoping for some semblance
of concentration.

01:30:20.832 --> 01:30:23.119
Crushed it up
with leaves and mice...

01:30:23.209 --> 01:30:27.044
and then wound up with this rancid tar
and turpentine mouthwash bullshit.

01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:29.122
Fuckin' Raid.

01:30:30.634 --> 01:30:32.626
Tastes pretty good to me.

01:30:32.719 --> 01:30:35.837
Hmm. Look. They have
a reserve pinot.

01:30:35.972 --> 01:30:38.715
- Let me use your phone.
- What's up?

01:30:38.850 --> 01:30:42.184
- I can't take it anymore. I gotta call Evelyn.
- Okay.

01:30:45.941 --> 01:30:47.898
Evelyn Berman-Silverman's office.

01:30:48.026 --> 01:30:51.019
- Hi, Jennifer. It's Miles again.
- Oh, hi, Miles.

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:53.024
- Hi.
- Let me see if I can get her.

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:55.071
Okay.

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:58.534
- You're in luck. I'll put you through.
- Okay.

01:31:01.081 --> 01:31:03.289
- Hi, Miles.
- Hi, Evelyn.

01:31:03.375 --> 01:31:05.287
It's your favorite client.

01:31:05.377 --> 01:31:08.040
- How's the trip?
- Oh, it's good, it's good.

01:31:08.129 --> 01:31:10.837
You know, we're drinking
some good wines, kicking back.

01:31:10.924 --> 01:31:13.416
- It's very nice.
- Right.

01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:16.173
So what's happening?
There's still no word, huh?

01:31:16.262 --> 01:31:18.299
Well, actually,
there is word.

01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:20.848
I spoke to Keith Kurtzman
this morning.

01:31:20.934 --> 01:31:22.846
Right. And?

01:31:22.936 --> 01:31:25.519
And...
they're passing.

01:31:27.148 --> 01:31:31.483
Conundrum's passing.
He said they really liked it.

01:31:31.569 --> 01:31:35.654
They really wanted to do it, but they just
couldn't figure out how to market it.

01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:38.858
He said it was
a really tough call.

01:31:40.412 --> 01:31:42.278
Oh. Right.

01:31:42.414 --> 01:31:45.031
<i>I'm sorry, Miles.</i>

01:31:45.125 --> 01:31:47.333
So I don't know
where that leaves us.

01:31:47.419 --> 01:31:52.005
I'm not sure how much more mileage
I can get out of continuing to submit it.

01:31:52.090 --> 01:31:56.209
I think it's one of those unfortunate cases
in the business right now...

01:31:56.302 --> 01:32:00.342
a-a fabulous book
with no home.

01:32:00.432 --> 01:32:03.175
<i>The whole industry's gotten gutless.</i>

01:32:03.268 --> 01:32:05.976
<i>It's not about the quality
of the books anymore.</i>

01:32:06.062 --> 01:32:08.270
<i>It's only about the marketing.</i>

01:32:12.736 --> 01:32:16.525
- Excuse me. Could I get a, uh, pour down here, please?
- Sure.

01:32:16.614 --> 01:32:20.608
There's a, uh, special
on the Syrah by the case.

01:32:21.786 --> 01:32:23.778
Hit me again.

01:32:27.792 --> 01:32:29.784
Thanks.

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:33.704
Excuse me. Could you just pour me
a full glass?

01:32:33.798 --> 01:32:35.790
I'll pay for it, okay?

01:32:37.343 --> 01:32:40.711
Sir, this is a winery,
not a bar.

01:32:40.805 --> 01:32:42.967
Oh. Come on.

01:32:43.058 --> 01:32:45.675
Just give me
a full goddamn pour.

01:32:47.353 --> 01:32:49.470
Excuse me.

01:32:49.564 --> 01:32:53.057
Why don't you buy a bottle,
then go outside?

01:32:56.446 --> 01:32:59.359
- What are you doing?
- I told you I need a drink, so I'm going to help myself.

01:32:59.491 --> 01:33:01.904
- Okay, pal? What do you think?
- Put the glass down.

01:33:01.993 --> 01:33:04.485
Let go of the fucking glass,
fucker!

01:33:10.502 --> 01:33:13.165
Mmm.

01:33:13.296 --> 01:33:17.540
- That's that.
- Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. Ho, buddy. Ho, buddy.

01:33:17.675 --> 01:33:19.632
- It's okay.
<i>- Get him out of here.</i>

01:33:19.761 --> 01:33:23.596
- Thanks a lot!
- It's okay. His, uh... His mother just died.

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:30.553
So you'll write another one.
You've got lots of ideas, right?

01:33:30.647 --> 01:33:33.230
No, I'm finished.
I'm not a writer.

01:33:33.316 --> 01:33:35.854
I'm a middle school
English teacher.

01:33:37.278 --> 01:33:39.770
Ah, the world doesn't give a shit
what I have to say.

01:33:39.864 --> 01:33:42.823
I'm unnecessary.

01:33:42.909 --> 01:33:46.744
I'm so insignificant,
I can't even kill myself.

01:33:46.830 --> 01:33:49.288
Miles, what the hell
is that supposed to mean?

01:33:49.374 --> 01:33:51.286
Come on, man.
You know.

01:33:51.376 --> 01:33:54.585
Hemingway, Sexton,
Plath, Woolf.

01:33:54.671 --> 01:33:57.664
You can't kill yourself before
you've even been published.

01:34:00.301 --> 01:34:04.136
What about the guy that wrote
<i>Confederacy Of Dunces?</i>

01:34:04.222 --> 01:34:08.762
He committed suicide before <i>he</i>
was published. Look how famous he is.

01:34:10.562 --> 01:34:12.519
Thanks.

01:34:14.983 --> 01:34:19.819
Just don't give up. All right?
You're gonna make it.

01:34:19.904 --> 01:34:22.442
Half my life is over,

01:34:22.532 --> 01:34:26.492
and I have nothing
to show for it, nothing.

01:34:26.578 --> 01:34:30.037
I'm a thumbprint on the window
of a skyscraper.

01:34:30.123 --> 01:34:34.117
I'm a smudge of excrement
on a tissue...

01:34:34.210 --> 01:34:38.329
surging out to sea with
a million tons of raw sewage.

01:34:38.423 --> 01:34:41.166
See? Right there.

01:34:41.259 --> 01:34:43.797
Just what you just said?
That is beautiful.

01:34:43.887 --> 01:34:47.471
"A smudge of excrement
surging out to sea."

01:34:47.599 --> 01:34:50.763
- Yeah.
- I could never write that.

01:34:50.852 --> 01:34:53.845
Neither could I, actually.
I think it's Bukowski.

01:35:18.296 --> 01:35:22.461
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

01:35:23.927 --> 01:35:26.385
- Look what I got for our favorite girl.
- Motherfucker!

01:35:26.471 --> 01:35:31.136
- Jesus Christ!
- You fucking lying piece of shit!

01:35:31.226 --> 01:35:35.345
You're getting married on Saturday?
What's with all that shit you said to me?

01:35:35.438 --> 01:35:37.851
- Stephanie, stop!
<i>- I can explain!</i>

01:35:37.982 --> 01:35:40.645
- You said you loved me!
<i>- I do!</i>

01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:43.853
- I hope you die!
- Stop it, Stephanie!

01:35:51.955 --> 01:35:55.539
Fuckface!
You too!

01:35:55.625 --> 01:35:57.161
Me?

01:35:59.504 --> 01:36:02.167
- You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
- No, I did not.

01:36:02.257 --> 01:36:04.249
No, I did not.

01:36:04.342 --> 01:36:06.755
It must have been Gary
at The Hitching Post.

01:36:06.844 --> 01:36:09.336
I think we mentioned it
to him the first night.

01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:13.014
Oh, did <i>we</i> mention it?
<i>You</i> mentioned it, asshole!

01:36:13.101 --> 01:36:15.718
I'm fucking hurting
over here.

01:36:15.812 --> 01:36:17.849
Keep it elevated.

01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:26.604
<i>No, I don't want anything.</i>

01:36:31.286 --> 01:36:33.528
<i>Uh, it's Miles.</i>

01:36:33.621 --> 01:36:38.616
I had to call
and, uh, tell you again...

01:36:38.710 --> 01:36:40.997
how much I enjoyed
our time together...

01:36:41.087 --> 01:36:44.046
and, uh, how sorry I am...

01:36:44.132 --> 01:36:47.125
that things turned out
the way they did.

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:52.509
I think you're great, Maya.

01:36:52.598 --> 01:36:56.592
Uh, I always have from the first time
that you, uh, waited on me.

01:36:59.063 --> 01:37:02.431
Uh, and while I'm at it,

01:37:02.525 --> 01:37:06.189
uh, I guess maybe you
should know that my book...

01:37:06.279 --> 01:37:09.568
is <i>not</i> getting published.

01:37:09.657 --> 01:37:13.651
I thought this one, uh, had a chance,
but I was wrong again.

01:37:14.912 --> 01:37:17.529
Once again.

01:37:17.623 --> 01:37:20.411
So you see, uh,

01:37:20.501 --> 01:37:23.665
I'm not really much
of a writer.

01:37:23.755 --> 01:37:26.748
I am not much
of anything, really.

01:37:38.644 --> 01:37:42.638
<i>I'm gonna have to have an operation,
maybe even a couple of 'em.</i>

01:37:42.732 --> 01:37:46.021
They're gonna wait for my nose
to heal first, then they break it again.

01:37:46.110 --> 01:37:49.353
Oh, Christ. Good thing you have
a voice-over career.

01:37:49.447 --> 01:37:53.157
It's gonna fuck that up too.
I oughta sue her ass.

01:37:53.242 --> 01:37:55.700
The only reason I won't
is to protect Christine.

01:37:55.828 --> 01:37:58.115
- That's thoughtful.
- Yeah.

01:38:02.168 --> 01:38:04.751
How did Stephanie know
it was on Saturday?

01:38:04.837 --> 01:38:07.170
We didn't get into that
with Gary.

01:38:09.050 --> 01:38:12.214
Huh. That's...
Yeah, let me think.

01:38:12.345 --> 01:38:17.010
- You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
- Yes, <i>I'm sure</i> I'm sure.

01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:20.138
And just what
are you implying, Jack?

01:38:20.228 --> 01:38:23.892
I'm really pissed off at you about all this,
if you want to know the truth.

01:38:23.981 --> 01:38:28.100
What is Maya going to think of me now,
just for associating with you?

01:38:31.614 --> 01:38:35.153
I don't know.
Sure seems fishy.

01:38:35.243 --> 01:38:37.280
Well.

01:38:37.370 --> 01:38:41.910
<i>Wherever there's a fight
so hungry people can eat,</i>

01:38:41.999 --> 01:38:44.116
<i>I'll be there.</i>

01:38:44.210 --> 01:38:47.419
<i>Wherever there's a cop
beating up a guy,</i>

01:38:47.505 --> 01:38:50.373
<i>I'll be there.</i>

01:38:50.466 --> 01:38:53.925
<i>I'll be in the way guys yell
when they're mad.</i>

01:38:54.011 --> 01:38:56.003
What's this look like
to you?

01:38:57.598 --> 01:39:00.966
Uh, it looks like you were
in a bad car accident.

01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:06.272
<i>When the people are
eating the stuff they raised...</i>

01:39:06.357 --> 01:39:08.849
I'm hungry.

01:39:12.238 --> 01:39:15.026
<i>Here we go.</i>

01:39:15.116 --> 01:39:18.029
- Nice.
- Thank you.

01:39:18.161 --> 01:39:21.700
- And here is your Handi Wipes.
- Oh.

01:39:21.789 --> 01:39:26.409
So that's what those are. For a minute
I thought you were promoting safe sex.

01:39:26.502 --> 01:39:29.461
That's a good one.
I'll have to remember that one.

01:39:29.547 --> 01:39:32.756
- I'll be right back with your corn bread.
- All righty.

01:39:36.304 --> 01:39:38.762
Bet you that chick's
two tons of fun.

01:39:38.890 --> 01:39:41.507
- You know, the grateful type?
- Mm-mmm.

01:39:41.601 --> 01:39:44.014
I don't know.
I wouldn't know about that.

01:39:47.648 --> 01:39:49.640
Mmm.

01:39:50.902 --> 01:39:52.859
- Hmm.
- Here you go.

01:39:54.572 --> 01:39:57.280
Nice technique there,
Cammi.

01:39:57.366 --> 01:40:00.325
Thank you. All in the wrist.

01:40:00.411 --> 01:40:03.199
You know, you look
really familiar to me.

01:40:03.331 --> 01:40:06.574
<i>- Are you from around here?</i>
- Actually, we're from San Diego. Why?

01:40:06.667 --> 01:40:10.206
I don't know.
You just seemed really familiar to me.

01:40:10.296 --> 01:40:13.539
- Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
- Hang on. Hang on.

01:40:13.633 --> 01:40:17.377
Um, did you ever know
a Derek Sommersby?

01:40:17.470 --> 01:40:21.805
Dr. Derek Sommersby
from <i>One Life To Live?</i>

01:40:23.184 --> 01:40:27.599
Just have to imagine him with
no bandage and shorter hair.

01:40:31.275 --> 01:40:34.109
No way!

01:40:34.195 --> 01:40:36.938
No way!
Oh, my gosh!

01:40:37.031 --> 01:40:40.991
<i>That's great!
Oh, my goodness!</i>

01:40:41.077 --> 01:40:43.535
Could you tell me where
the bathroom is, please?

01:40:43.621 --> 01:40:47.285
Oh, yeah. It's right over there,
right past the buffalo. Wow!

01:40:47.375 --> 01:40:51.415
Oh, my gosh. I can't believe
you're sitting at my table.

01:41:16.904 --> 01:41:20.147
Listen, man, Cammi gets off
in an hour, so I was thinking...

01:41:20.241 --> 01:41:23.200
I'd just hang around,
have a drink.

01:41:23.327 --> 01:41:26.911
You know, make sure she gets home safe.

01:41:26.998 --> 01:41:29.911
You're joking, right?

01:41:30.001 --> 01:41:32.539
No.

01:41:32.628 --> 01:41:34.540
Un-fucking-believable.

01:41:34.630 --> 01:41:40.092
Can't we just go back
to the motel and hang out,

01:41:40.177 --> 01:41:43.261
get up early,
play nine holes of golf...

01:41:43.347 --> 01:41:45.339
before we head home?

01:41:49.186 --> 01:41:52.179
Listen, man,
you're my friend,

01:41:52.273 --> 01:41:55.266
and I know
you care about me.

01:41:55.359 --> 01:41:58.022
I know you disapprove,
and I respect that.

01:41:58.112 --> 01:42:02.777
But there are some things that
I have to do that you don't understand.

01:42:02.867 --> 01:42:07.703
You understand literature,
movies, wine,

01:42:07.788 --> 01:42:10.280
but you don't understand
my plight.

01:42:29.727 --> 01:42:32.310
Yeah?

01:42:32.438 --> 01:42:35.806
- Holy shit! Jesus Christ!
- Fuck. Fuck.

01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:39.109
God, it's fucking freezing
out there!

01:42:39.236 --> 01:42:42.229
- God, yeah.
- Vicodin. Where's the Vicodin?

01:42:42.323 --> 01:42:44.315
Uh...

01:42:46.869 --> 01:42:49.862
Oh.

01:42:49.955 --> 01:42:51.867
Here.

01:42:51.957 --> 01:42:53.914
Oh. Oh.

01:42:57.380 --> 01:42:59.667
Fucking chick's married,
man.

01:42:59.757 --> 01:43:02.090
What?

01:43:02.176 --> 01:43:04.668
Her husband works the night shift, and he
comes home and catches me on the floor...

01:43:04.762 --> 01:43:06.879
with my cock
in his wife's ass.

01:43:06.972 --> 01:43:10.932
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Jesus. Jack!

01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:14.394
- And you walked all the way from Solvang?
- No, ran.

01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:16.437
Twisted my ankle too.

01:43:16.565 --> 01:43:19.774
- That's five klicks, Jack.
- Fuckin'- A right, it's five klicks.

01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:22.944
At one point I had to cut through
an ostrich farm.

01:43:23.072 --> 01:43:26.361
Those fuckers are mean.

01:43:32.873 --> 01:43:34.865
Whoo!

01:43:36.919 --> 01:43:40.754
<i>- Oh!</i>
- We gotta go back.

01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:43.708
What?

01:43:43.801 --> 01:43:47.044
<i>We gotta go back.
I left my wallet.</i>

01:43:47.138 --> 01:43:49.050
Credit cards, cash,
my fucking I.D.

01:43:49.181 --> 01:43:51.673
<i>- Everything. We gotta go back.</i>
- Big deal. It's fine.

01:43:51.767 --> 01:43:54.976
Don't worry about it. We'll call now
and we'll cancel your cards.

01:43:55.062 --> 01:43:57.896
<i>No, Miles, you don't understand.
The wedding rings.</i>

01:43:57.982 --> 01:43:59.894
The wedding rings
are in my wallet.

01:43:59.984 --> 01:44:04.945
Fine, they're in your wallet,
and you left your wallet in some bar, okay?

01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:07.647
- Christine will understand.
- She had to order them special.

01:44:07.742 --> 01:44:09.654
It took her forever
to find 'em.

01:44:09.744 --> 01:44:13.909
They've got this design of dolphins
and our names engraved in Sanskrit.

01:44:13.998 --> 01:44:17.582
We gotta go back, man. Christine will
fucking crucify me, Miles.

01:44:17.668 --> 01:44:19.751
No way, no way, no way.

01:44:19.837 --> 01:44:21.829
Please. Please!

01:44:21.922 --> 01:44:25.165
Forget it. Your wallet was
stolen in some bar.

01:44:25.301 --> 01:44:28.260
<i>- It happens every day.</i>
- No, we gotta go back and get my wallet, Miles.

01:44:28.345 --> 01:44:32.055
<i>I'm telling you, those rings
are irreplaceable.</i>

01:44:32.141 --> 01:44:35.225
Look, I know I fucked up, okay?
I know I fucked up.

01:44:35.352 --> 01:44:37.344
<i>- But you've gotta help me.</i>
- Yeah.

01:44:37.438 --> 01:44:41.057
<i>You've gotta help me, Miles,
please! Please!</i>

01:44:41.150 --> 01:44:43.437
I can't lose Christine, Miles.

01:44:43.527 --> 01:44:46.190
I just... I can't.
I can't lose Christine.

01:44:46.322 --> 01:44:48.530
- Mm-hmm.
<i>- I know I fucked up.</i>

01:44:48.616 --> 01:44:52.530
<i>I know I did a bad thing, all right?
And I know I'm a bad person.</i>

01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:57.081
I know I am. But you gotta help me!
You have to help me, Miles.

01:44:57.166 --> 01:45:00.625
<i>Okay?
Tell me you'll help me.</i>

01:45:00.711 --> 01:45:03.499
<i>If I lose Christine,
I-I-I...</i>

01:45:03.589 --> 01:45:05.706
I'm nothing.

01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:09.259
I just have...
I'm nothing.

01:45:09.345 --> 01:45:11.337
<i>God.</i>

01:45:11.472 --> 01:45:13.930
- Did she tell you she was married?
- Yeah.

01:45:14.016 --> 01:45:15.973
So what the fuck
were you thinking?

01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:19.644
Wasn't supposed to be back till 6:00.
Fucker rolls in at 5:00.

01:45:19.730 --> 01:45:22.768
Cutting it a little close,
don't you think?

01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:25.187
- This is the block.
- You sure?

01:45:25.277 --> 01:45:27.269
Yeah.

01:45:30.658 --> 01:45:32.570
That's it. That's it.

01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:34.617
<i>That's the one right there.</i>

01:45:34.745 --> 01:45:36.828
- Yeah?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:45:36.914 --> 01:45:38.906
<i>Okay.</i>

01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:46.456
All right. Okay, so what's
the plan?

01:45:46.549 --> 01:45:49.041
Uh, the plan is...

01:45:49.134 --> 01:45:51.000
you go.

01:45:51.136 --> 01:45:54.220
- Me?
- 'Cause of my ankle.

01:45:54.306 --> 01:45:57.299
Still hurts. Just go explain
the situation, Miles.

01:45:57.393 --> 01:46:00.010
Explain the situation.
Yes.

01:46:00.104 --> 01:46:04.348
"Excuse me, sir. My friend was the one
balling your wife a couple of hours ago.

01:46:04.441 --> 01:46:07.605
"Really sorry. He seems to have left
his wallet behind.

01:46:07.695 --> 01:46:10.654
I was wondering if I could come in
and just poke around. I don't know."

01:46:10.781 --> 01:46:13.945
- Yeah, just like that. That's good.
- Oh, for Christ's sake.

01:46:16.912 --> 01:46:20.622
Oh, fuck it! I'll go.
I guess I have to do everything.

01:46:20.708 --> 01:46:24.247
No. Hold on.

01:48:10.275 --> 01:48:13.268
<i>You think I don't fuck you, bitch?
I'm fucking you now.</i>

01:48:13.362 --> 01:48:16.480
<i>I'm a bad girl.
I'm a bad girl!</i>

01:48:16.573 --> 01:48:19.111
You picked him up and you fucked him,
didn't you, bitch?

01:48:19.201 --> 01:48:22.911
<i>Yeah, I picked him up and I fucked him.
I'm a bad girl!</i>

01:48:22.997 --> 01:48:25.660
You liked fucking him,
didn't you, you little whore?

01:48:25.749 --> 01:48:29.959
I liked it when you caught me fucking him!
Oh, yes! Oh, yeah!

01:48:30.045 --> 01:48:31.911
<i>You are a bad bitch.</i>

01:48:32.047 --> 01:48:34.505
- Yeah, you caught me.
- You're such a whore.

01:48:34.591 --> 01:48:36.924
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

01:48:37.052 --> 01:48:39.840
<i>- Oh, baby.
- Oh, it's so good!</i>

01:48:42.016 --> 01:48:43.928
<i>I fucked him.</i>

01:48:44.018 --> 01:48:47.261
<i>- You're so bad.
- I am. Yeah.</i>

01:48:53.193 --> 01:48:57.733
<i>- What the fuck!
- The wallet! He's got Derek's wallet!</i>

01:48:57.823 --> 01:49:00.736
<i>I think they were
surprised by the level of protest...</i>

01:49:00.826 --> 01:49:03.569
<i>that was really happening
within the company.</i>

01:49:03.662 --> 01:49:08.623
<i>The injustice may be their plan,
and they said, "Well, we can't just go"...</i>

01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:12.623
- Oh! Here's your wallet! Oh, shit!
- Motherfucker!

01:49:12.713 --> 01:49:15.205
Open the goddamn door!

01:49:15.299 --> 01:49:17.256
<i>- You got it! You got my wallet!
- I'm gonna kill your ass!</i>

01:49:17.342 --> 01:49:22.178
I'll find you! I will find you, bub!
I'll find your ass!

01:49:22.264 --> 01:49:25.382
You're mine, man!
You're mine!

01:49:25.476 --> 01:49:28.139
<i>Fuck you!
I'm gonna get your ass!</i>

01:49:59.176 --> 01:50:03.796
- You wanna let me drive?
- No, it's all right. I got it.

01:50:03.889 --> 01:50:07.382
Hey, you know, you oughta invite Maya
to the wedding.

01:50:07.476 --> 01:50:09.388
Hmm.

01:50:09.478 --> 01:50:12.266
Somehow I think inviting Maya
to the wedding...

01:50:12.356 --> 01:50:15.440
is not the right move
at this juncture.

01:50:15.526 --> 01:50:17.438
I don't know.

01:50:17.528 --> 01:50:19.485
In fact, after all
of your shenanigans,

01:50:19.571 --> 01:50:22.609
it's gonna be hard for me to ever go to
The Hitching Post again.

01:50:22.699 --> 01:50:25.658
<i>You know, there was a nice way
to respond to that.</i>

01:50:25.786 --> 01:50:29.279
- Come on. Let me drive.
- No, I got it. You should rest.

01:50:29.373 --> 01:50:32.241
You know what?
I feel like driving.

01:50:32.334 --> 01:50:34.246
Okay.

01:50:34.336 --> 01:50:37.500
Uh... Hey, put on
your seat belt, okay?

01:50:37.589 --> 01:50:39.922
I was just about to.
What's the problem?

01:50:40.050 --> 01:50:44.511
- Just want to remind you to be safe.
- We missed the entrance.

01:50:44.596 --> 01:50:47.213
What are you doing, Jack?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:50:47.349 --> 01:50:49.807
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the hell are you doing?
- Hang on.

01:50:49.893 --> 01:50:52.226
Jack!

01:50:52.312 --> 01:50:54.178
What the fuck!

01:50:54.314 --> 01:50:57.148
- You said it looked like an accident.
- What the fuck!

01:50:57.234 --> 01:50:59.146
I'll pay for it.

01:50:59.236 --> 01:51:04.231
Jesus. Christ, Jack!
Oh, for Ch... Look at this!

01:51:04.324 --> 01:51:07.783
- Huh.
- Oh.

01:51:07.870 --> 01:51:09.782
I don't know.

01:51:09.872 --> 01:51:13.616
Doesn't look like anyone was
injured in this one.

01:51:13.709 --> 01:51:15.575
No. No.

01:51:15.711 --> 01:51:18.328
- Watch your head.
- Yeah.

01:51:18.422 --> 01:51:21.631
Boy, you broke a couple of 'em,
you know.

01:51:21.758 --> 01:51:24.717
- Whatever. Sorry.
- No, no, no. It's not "whatever."

01:51:24.803 --> 01:51:27.420
You fuckin' derelict.

01:51:27.514 --> 01:51:29.426
<i>You ready?</i>

01:51:29.516 --> 01:51:32.725
Just get it over with.

01:52:13.477 --> 01:52:17.687
Okeydoke. All right.

01:52:17.773 --> 01:52:20.561
Well, I guess
that's about it.

01:52:20.692 --> 01:52:25.483
- Want to come inside?
- Uh, no. No, you're on your own.

01:52:26.782 --> 01:52:29.399
All right. I guess
I'll see you at the rehearsal.

01:52:29.493 --> 01:52:31.485
Yup.

01:52:32.788 --> 01:52:34.996
I love you, man.

01:52:35.082 --> 01:52:37.415
Yeah. Back at ya.

01:52:37.542 --> 01:52:42.037
- Miles, don't drive away until they see the car.
- I know, I know, I know.

01:52:42.130 --> 01:52:44.964
Hey, wait a second. Wait a second.
How come I wasn't hurt?

01:52:45.050 --> 01:52:48.543
'Cause you were wearing
your seat belt.

01:52:51.014 --> 01:52:53.006
Nicely done.

01:53:13.704 --> 01:53:15.661
- Hi.
- Jack.

01:53:15.747 --> 01:53:17.704
- Yeah.
- Uh, Christine, Mike!

01:54:06.256 --> 01:54:08.248
Amen.

01:55:30.841 --> 01:55:33.754
Hey, Miles.

01:55:33.844 --> 01:55:38.305
Hi, Vicki.
Wow, you look beautiful.

01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:40.302
Thanks.

01:55:40.392 --> 01:55:43.055
Um, this is Ken Cortland,
my husband.

01:55:43.186 --> 01:55:45.052
<i>- How are you?</i>
- How are you?

01:55:45.188 --> 01:55:47.225
<i>- Good, thanks.</i>
- Yeah, yeah. Nice to meet you.

01:55:47.315 --> 01:55:50.729
- You're a lucky guy.
- Yes, I am. Thank you.

01:55:50.819 --> 01:55:52.902
Yeah.

01:55:52.988 --> 01:55:55.856
Well, I'll just wait
for you at the car.

01:55:55.991 --> 01:55:58.984
<i>- It was great meeting you, Miles.</i>
- Ken.

01:56:02.706 --> 01:56:06.245
- Well, that was big of him.
- Yeah, he's good that way.

01:56:06.376 --> 01:56:10.336
- He's very considerate.
- That's great.

01:56:10.422 --> 01:56:12.835
So how are you doing?

01:56:12.924 --> 01:56:15.712
Since the last time we spoke?
I don't know.

01:56:15.802 --> 01:56:19.091
Could be better.
Could be worse.

01:56:19.222 --> 01:56:23.717
- So what's happening with your book?
- Um, universally rejected.

01:56:23.852 --> 01:56:27.971
- Strike three.
- Oh, Miles, that's awful.

01:56:28.064 --> 01:56:30.807
What are you gonna do?

01:56:30.901 --> 01:56:34.144
Back to the drawing board,
I guess. Or not.

01:56:34.237 --> 01:56:36.854
I don't know.

01:56:36.948 --> 01:56:39.941
So, anyway,
you're married.

01:56:40.035 --> 01:56:43.244
Congratulations.
You look happy.

01:56:43.371 --> 01:56:45.784
- I am.
- Good.

01:56:45.874 --> 01:56:48.617
Seems like everybody's
getting married.

01:56:48.710 --> 01:56:52.579
Last year was all divorces.
This year it's all weddings.

01:56:52.714 --> 01:56:55.707
- Cyclical, I guess.
- I guess.

01:57:01.097 --> 01:57:04.261
Well, uh, what do you say
we hit the reception?

01:57:04.351 --> 01:57:07.389
Have some champagne,
toast the newlyweds, huh?

01:57:07.479 --> 01:57:09.391
Not me.
I'm not drinking.

01:57:09.481 --> 01:57:13.600
You quit drinking.
Really?

01:57:13.693 --> 01:57:15.685
I'm pregnant.

01:57:17.614 --> 01:57:19.606
I see.

01:57:20.951 --> 01:57:23.443
Yes, I see. Great.

01:57:25.497 --> 01:57:28.490
Well, congratulations
again, Vicki.

01:57:28.583 --> 01:57:31.496
Boy, that's wonderful news.

01:57:33.213 --> 01:57:35.876
- See you over there, Miles?
- Yeah.

01:59:40.131 --> 01:59:42.088
Hmm.

01:59:47.722 --> 01:59:51.306
<i>"'The marrow of his bone,'
I repeated aimlessly.</i>

01:59:51.393 --> 01:59:53.851
<i>"This, at last,
penetrated my mind.</i>

01:59:53.937 --> 01:59:57.021
"Phineas had died
from the marrow of his bone...

01:59:57.107 --> 02:00:00.396
"flowing down his bloodstream
to his heart.

02:00:00.485 --> 02:00:03.774
"I did not cry then
or ever about Finny.

02:00:03.863 --> 02:00:07.072
"I did not cry
even when I stood,

02:00:07.158 --> 02:00:10.993
<i>"watching him being lowered into his
family's straitlaced burial ground...</i>

02:00:11.079 --> 02:00:12.991
<i>"outside of Boston.</i>

02:00:13.081 --> 02:00:16.540
<i>"I could not escape the feeling
that this was my own funeral,</i>

02:00:16.626 --> 02:00:20.245
<i>and you do not cry
in that case."</i>

02:00:20.338 --> 02:00:23.502
<i>Should I keep reading
the next chapter, Mr. Raymond?</i>

02:00:23.591 --> 02:00:27.426
Uh, no, no.
We'll pick up there Monday.

02:01:14.434 --> 02:01:17.302
One new message.

02:01:17.395 --> 02:01:21.560
Hello, Miles. It's Maya.

02:01:21.649 --> 02:01:24.107
Thanks for your letter.

02:01:24.194 --> 02:01:26.231
I-I would have called sooner,

02:01:26.321 --> 02:01:29.280
but I think I needed some time to think
about everything that happened...

02:01:29.365 --> 02:01:32.858
and what you wrote to me.

02:01:32.952 --> 02:01:35.660
Another reason, um,
I didn't call you sooner...

02:01:35.747 --> 02:01:39.240
is because I wanted to finish your book,
which I finally did last night.

02:01:39.334 --> 02:01:42.372
And I think
it's really lovely, Miles.

02:01:42.462 --> 02:01:44.954
You're so good with words.

02:01:45.048 --> 02:01:47.506
Who cares if it's not
getting published?

02:01:47.592 --> 02:01:51.882
There are so many beautiful
and... painful things about it.

02:01:53.139 --> 02:01:55.927
Did you really
go through all that?

02:01:56.017 --> 02:01:58.634
Must have been awful.

02:01:58.728 --> 02:02:03.689
And the sister character...
geez, what a wreck.

02:02:03.775 --> 02:02:08.270
But I have to say that, well,
I was really confused by the ending.

02:02:08.363 --> 02:02:11.822
<i>I mean, did the father
finally commit suicide, or what?</i>

02:02:11.908 --> 02:02:13.900
<i>It's driving me crazy.</i>

02:02:16.454 --> 02:02:18.616
<i>Anyway,</i>

02:02:18.706 --> 02:02:22.620
<i>it's turned cold and rainy
here lately,</i>

02:02:22.710 --> 02:02:25.327
<i>but I like winter.</i>

02:02:25.421 --> 02:02:30.257
<i>So, listen, if you ever do decide to
come up here again, you should let me know.</i>

02:02:30.343 --> 02:02:33.177
<i>I would say stop by the restaurant,
but to tell you the truth,</i>

02:02:33.263 --> 02:02:35.721
<i>I'm not sure how much longer
I'm gonna be working there...</i>

02:02:35.807 --> 02:02:37.924
<i>because I'm going to
graduate soon.</i>

02:02:38.017 --> 02:02:40.555
<i>So I'll probably
want to relocate.</i>

02:02:40.645 --> 02:02:42.637
<i>I mean, we'll see.</i>

02:02:44.107 --> 02:02:48.067
<i>Anyway, like I said,
I really loved your novel.</i>

02:02:48.152 --> 02:02:53.068
<i>Don't give up, Miles.
Keep writing.</i>

02:02:53.157 --> 02:02:55.149
<i>I hope you're well.</i>

02:02:56.452 --> 02:02:58.444
<i>Bye.</i>
