Penn and Teller!

01:00.994 --> 01:03.863
[cheers and applause]

01:15.375 --> 01:17.343
If Penn and Teller
are incorrect about

01:17.377 --> 01:18.878
how a trick is done,

01:18.912 --> 01:20.647
they give up a slot
in their show

01:20.680 --> 01:23.316

"Fool Us" trophy.

Let's see how they do
against tonight's first act.

01:28.688 --> 01:31.591
- My dad is from Iran,
my mom is from Afghanistan,

01:31.624 --> 01:35.061
and they can came here
to live the American dream.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.697
My dad started
an Italian restaurant,

01:37.730 --> 01:39.899
in Texas of all places.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.735
This was the place my mom
and my dad got married in.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.171
One night, my dad
was locking up the doors

01:45.205 --> 01:47.941
so he could come see us,
his family.

01:47.974 --> 01:52.712
As he was walking to his car,
he got met by three masked men.

01:52.745 --> 01:55.081
And they killed my father.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.117
I was one when that happened.

01:57.150 --> 02:01.521
And my family kept it a secret
for me for years.

02:01.554 --> 02:04.491
So it's not surprising
I got into magic

02:04.524 --> 02:08.795
because magic is an art form
about secrets.

02:08.828 --> 02:10.830
But magic also taught me
that when you have a gift

02:10.864 --> 02:13.733
that is in you and you
give it out into the world,

02:13.766 --> 02:16.169
then really you become the
hero in somebody else's story.

02:16.202 --> 02:18.571
And to me, that's real magic.

02:18.605 --> 02:21.374
Whenever I get to share
what I do with the world,

02:21.407 --> 02:24.144
I just imagine
that my dad is behind me

- When you started.

08:22.702 --> 08:24.470
And we followed that.

08:24.504 --> 08:29.509
And we think that,
you just got

08:29.542 --> 08:33.212
a shim metal plate in the card

08:33.246 --> 08:36.449
under the card
that was selected.

08:36.482 --> 08:39.685
And that stopped.
And that's where the card was.

08:39.719 --> 08:41.487

you did it, then you fooled us.

We're pretty sure
that's the way you did it.

08:43.656 --> 08:48.528
So you had a little metal plate
or something in there. Right?

08:48.561 --> 08:52.398

correctly, like a metal plate--

- Sorry,
this is going really fast.

So I'm so sorry, but it
it's a, like a metal plate.

We just loved everything.

16:04.029 --> 16:06.799
If you wanted to do
a theatrical production

16:06.832 --> 16:08.434

16:08.467 --> 16:11.036
First thing I said was,
"That was just perfect."

16:11.070 --> 16:12.638
And the first thing
Teller said was,

16:12.671 --> 16:14.540
"It's the best cups and balls
I've ever seen."

16:14.573 --> 16:16.542
It's so good.

16:16.575 --> 16:18.877

so great is that we all know

16:18.911 --> 16:20.612

16:20.646 --> 16:22.548
And you know
what tennis balls are.

16:22.581 --> 16:24.383
With jugglers and magicians,

16:24.416 --> 16:27.019
they often have props
you don't know what they are.

16:27.052 --> 16:29.355
And I also know as a juggler

16:29.388 --> 16:31.857
that tennis balls are
not easy to juggle.

16:31.890 --> 16:34.226
And you made it even harder
for yourself

16:34.259 --> 16:35.961
because the tennis balls
you were juggling

16:35.995 --> 16:37.629
sometimes are even harder.

16:37.663 --> 16:41.300
And you did a great,
great job with that.

16:41.333 --> 16:45.304
And also having cups and balls
that big so you can see it,

16:45.337 --> 16:47.840
so it's theatrical,
so it's really out there,

16:47.873 --> 16:49.675

what we're looking at.

incredibly clever things

22:23.608 --> 22:25.744
Did that number just pop
into your mind, Alyson?

22:25.777 --> 22:28.347
Or did you actually feel
the tendrils of control?

22:28.380 --> 22:30.982
Almost like a squid sucking
at your neocortex?

22:31.016 --> 22:33.919
[laughter]
- Uh, sure.

22:33.952 --> 22:37.723
- I know you felt it, Alyson,
because you said three.

22:37.756 --> 22:39.825
And that's the number
that they wanted you to say.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.660
And the number that
I wrote down, Alyson?

22:41.693 --> 22:45.530
Was 24.
[laughter]

22:45.564 --> 22:49.868
You missed by 20--
she missed by 21.

22:49.901 --> 22:52.371
You all think
that was an accident?

22:52.404 --> 22:56.541
No, that is the magic
of mind control.

22:56.575 --> 23:01.480
Miss by 21.
[audience gasps]

23:01.513 --> 23:06.184
[mouths words]
[laughter and applause]

23:06.218 --> 23:09.221
- That's amazing.
Andy Deemer.

23:09.254 --> 23:11.490
[cheers and applause]

23:11.523 --> 23:14.292
Wow, wow.

23:14.326 --> 23:16.495
So have you ever thought
of switching to decaf?

23:16.528 --> 23:18.296
[laughter]

23:18.330 --> 23:20.132
- My wife asks me
the same thing every day.

23:20.165 --> 23:22.234
- I bet.

23:22.267 --> 23:25.904
Is mind control real to you?

23:25.937 --> 23:28.907
- I think elements of it,
influence are real.

23:28.940 --> 23:32.811
Obviously, all of this is just
showmanship and entertainment.

23:32.844 --> 23:35.847
- Okay. Do you get cornered
in airports?

23:35.881 --> 23:38.049
- Well, after my shows,
people love to come out

23:38.083 --> 23:40.051
to the lobby

23:40.085 --> 23:44.055
and talk about their unique
beliefs or their crazy uncle.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.591
And I've done a lot of research

23:46.625 --> 23:48.660
into all the conspiracy
theories, all the main ones,

23:48.693 --> 23:50.495
and I love talking about them.

23:50.529 --> 23:53.198
- Nice. Do you ever try
to convince other people

23:53.231 --> 23:55.066
of a different way of thinking,

23:55.100 --> 23:58.437
like people that think
the Earth is flat?

23:58.470 --> 24:00.272
- You, you mean people
who think the earth is round?

24:00.305 --> 24:01.606
[laughter]

24:01.640 --> 24:03.975
- Okay.

24:04.009 --> 24:06.344
- Of course,
I have my beliefs, too.

24:06.378 --> 24:09.614
And of course I try
and argue those beliefs. Yes.

24:09.648 --> 24:11.550
- And does it ever get heated?

24:11.583 --> 24:14.352
- No, because you'll never
convince each other.

24:14.386 --> 24:17.022
And I love hearing about
the new conspiracy theories

24:17.055 --> 24:20.025
that I don't know about.
- Okay.

24:20.058 --> 24:22.828
So Penn and Teller get one shot
to figure this out.

24:22.861 --> 24:24.496
Let's see if they did.

24:24.529 --> 24:27.699
- Andy, great. Really great.
It's a great act.

24:27.732 --> 24:31.536
You came back with the opening
with the Paul Reubens thing,

24:31.570 --> 24:34.139
who's a buddy of ours
and is great.

24:34.172 --> 24:37.042
You looked very regal in that
whole outfit with the trick.

24:37.075 --> 24:39.744
And everything looked really,
really, really wonderful.

24:39.778 --> 24:41.413
And what you may not know,

24:41.446 --> 24:43.014
it's nice to have someone come
out here and tell the truth,

24:43.048 --> 24:45.317
but Teller and I
are the Illuminati.

24:45.350 --> 24:46.885
[laughter]

24:46.918 --> 24:49.554
But you didn't give up enough.
We're okay with it, still.

24:49.588 --> 24:52.858
And of course, we're kidding.
It's just a joke.

24:52.891 --> 24:55.393
But anyway, Andy, when we get
to the other part of that,

24:55.427 --> 24:57.429
the prediction,
we love predictions

24:57.462 --> 25:00.732
that start out wrong,
come out right.

25:00.765 --> 25:03.201
And then the turnover
was really, really nice.

25:03.235 --> 25:05.337
What you think of the
prediction there, Teller?

25:05.370 --> 25:08.139
Yeah. Teller gives you
a thumbs up on that.

25:08.173 --> 25:11.376
So it was really wonderful
routine, really funny,

25:11.409 --> 25:14.112
really smart, well-rehearsed,
very, very clean.

25:14.145 --> 25:16.715
But we don't think
you fooled us.

25:16.748 --> 25:18.383
And I think we snuck
in a few things

25:18.416 --> 25:21.152
that you probably heard
some code words in there.

25:21.186 --> 25:24.222
- Correct. Thank you.
Both of you.

25:24.256 --> 25:27.125
- So Andy, do they have a clue
how you did your trick?

25:27.158 --> 25:28.460
- The government may have
fooled them,

25:28.493 --> 25:30.862
but I certainly didn't.
[laughter]

25:30.896 --> 25:32.464
- Well, thank you so much.

25:32.497 --> 25:35.267
Andy Deemer!
[cheers and applause]

25:37.602 --> 25:40.639
Walking into a black hole.
[laughter]

25:40.672 --> 25:42.073
Come on back.

25:42.107 --> 25:44.376
We've got more magic
than you can shake a wand at.

25:44.409 --> 25:46.144
We'll be right back.

25:46.177 --> 25:48.446
[cheers and applause]

25:56.087 --> 25:58.823
[cheers and applause]

25:58.857 --> 26:00.358
- Welcome back.

26:00.392 --> 26:03.461
Let's meet the next magician
taking on Penn and Teller.

26:05.864 --> 26:08.600
- Hi, I'm Thomas Solomon.

26:08.633 --> 26:12.037
I made my name in magic
as an escape artist.

26:12.070 --> 26:15.273
I can escape
from pretty much anything.

26:15.307 --> 26:18.510
I got so good at it,
I challenge my audience

26:18.543 --> 26:20.645
to bring in any handcuffs
they wanted.

26:20.679 --> 26:25.150
The deal was if I can get out
of them, I get to keep them.

26:25.183 --> 26:29.888
Now I've got a collection
of over 1,000 handcuffs.

26:29.921 --> 26:31.556
Like a lot of magicians,

26:31.590 --> 26:35.160
I fell in love with the
artistry of magic as a kid,

26:35.193 --> 26:38.496
although for me, it was
a little more of a challenge.

26:38.530 --> 26:42.534
My parents weren't in favor
of me pursuing it as a career,

26:42.567 --> 26:44.369
so I left home.

26:44.402 --> 26:46.304
I moved to New York
at 20 years old

26:46.338 --> 26:49.040
with nothing
and slept on the streets,

26:49.074 --> 26:51.876
all for the chance
to follow my passion.

26:51.910 --> 26:54.846
In my opinion, you cannot
be a great escape artist

26:54.879 --> 26:56.681
without being
a great magician,

26:56.715 --> 26:59.484
so I'm doing something
very different tonight.

26:59.517 --> 27:02.187
And with any luck,
I'll escape with a trophy.

27:02.220 --> 27:05.023
[cheers and applause]

27:07.359 --> 27:10.862
- Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Thomas Solomon.

27:10.895 --> 27:12.931
[cheers and applause]

27:12.964 --> 27:14.599
- Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

27:14.633 --> 27:18.637
Penn, Teller,
our entire physical world

27:18.670 --> 27:21.673
is built
from simple geometric shapes.

27:21.706 --> 27:23.174
For example,

27:23.208 --> 27:25.510
if you were to step outside
the Penn & Teller Theater

27:25.543 --> 27:28.513
onto the glamorous
Las Vegas strip,

27:28.546 --> 27:31.950
you would notice some
of these geometric shapes

27:31.983 --> 27:36.488
in architecture, automobiles,
even the jewelry that we wear.

27:36.521 --> 27:40.058
All tangible objects
that can be broken down

27:40.091 --> 27:42.227
into simple geometric shapes.

27:42.260 --> 27:43.728
Now, as we all know,

27:43.762 --> 27:46.798
there exists
three basic shapes.

27:46.831 --> 27:50.535
There is the square,

27:50.568 --> 27:53.338
a symbol of stability
and order.

27:53.371 --> 27:58.543
There is the circle,
a symbol of energy

27:58.576 --> 28:00.545
and freedom of movement.

28:00.578 --> 28:02.147
Finally, there is the triangle.

28:02.180 --> 28:03.448
It's three sides,

28:03.481 --> 28:06.084
a symbol of our past,
present, and future.

28:06.117 --> 28:08.086
And it is the past, present,
and future

28:08.119 --> 28:11.990
that will be on display
here today.

28:12.023 --> 28:14.292
But besides
the three dimensions

28:14.325 --> 28:17.662
of these geometric shapes,
there is the fourth dimension

28:17.696 --> 28:21.266
defined as the backwards
and forwards movement

28:21.299 --> 28:23.134
of an object in time.

28:23.168 --> 28:24.335
Watch.

28:24.369 --> 28:25.603
If I were to cover the ball

28:25.637 --> 28:28.440
with a cone in the world
of the fourth dimension,

28:28.473 --> 28:31.476
the ball disappears
and travels backwards in time

28:31.509 --> 28:35.947
just a few seconds
to where it all began,

28:35.980 --> 28:38.216
here...

28:38.249 --> 28:41.352
in my pockets.
How cool is that?

28:41.386 --> 28:42.954
Of course,
the three-dimensional world

28:42.987 --> 28:44.389
is equally astonishing.

28:44.422 --> 28:46.825
It allows you to do
some amazing things.

28:46.858 --> 28:50.028
Like I can pull one solid
right through another solid.

28:50.061 --> 28:51.162
Of course,
if I were to place

28:51.196 --> 28:52.630
the white ball
back into my pocket,

28:52.664 --> 28:54.199
I could employ
the fourth dimension

28:54.232 --> 28:56.801
so that it travels back
underneath the cone.

28:56.835 --> 28:58.136
Remember, ladies and gentlemen,

28:58.169 --> 29:00.371
the fourth dimension
is the backwards

29:00.405 --> 29:03.108
and forwards movement
of an object in time

29:03.141 --> 29:05.977
just a few seconds
to where it all began

29:06.010 --> 29:08.646
here in my pocket.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.415
Of course,

29:10.448 --> 29:11.850
the three-dimensional world
is equally astonishing.

29:11.883 --> 29:13.685
It allows you to do
some amazing things like

29:13.718 --> 29:16.521
I can place the white ball
on top of the cone

29:16.554 --> 29:19.324
and then push it through
the apex of the cone.

29:19.357 --> 29:21.593
Likewise, I can cover
the white ball with the cone

29:21.626 --> 29:24.162
and then form it
from the bottom of the cone

29:24.195 --> 29:28.099
over here to my elbow.

29:28.133 --> 29:31.035
And from my elbow, I could
place it into my pocket.

29:31.069 --> 29:33.338
And from my pocket, I can
employ the fourth dimension

29:33.371 --> 29:36.307
so that it travels back
underneath the cone.

29:36.341 --> 29:38.643
Isn't the fourth
dimension amazing?

29:38.676 --> 29:40.845
You know, all of this backwards
and forwards movement

29:40.879 --> 29:45.016
of an object in time can be
a little, well, confusing.

29:45.049 --> 29:47.185
And you might have been
watching the white ball

29:47.218 --> 29:48.520
very closely.
When in reality,

29:48.553 --> 29:50.989
you should have been
watching the red ball.

29:51.022 --> 29:53.024
But I'll let you in
on a little secret:

29:53.057 --> 29:55.727
the red ball is an illusion.

29:55.760 --> 29:57.662
It doesn't exist.

29:57.695 --> 30:00.799
It's a red herring, if you
will, meant to distract you.

30:00.832 --> 30:02.500
You see, instead of watching
the red ball,

30:02.534 --> 30:04.536
you should have been
watching the white ball.

30:04.569 --> 30:06.471
And the white ball
is not underneath the cone.

30:06.504 --> 30:10.175
No, that is over here
inside...

30:10.208 --> 30:13.077
of my pocket.

30:13.111 --> 30:14.546
You know,
people ask me all the time

30:14.579 --> 30:16.047
in relation to this illusion.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.550
Is it possible
to combine the second,

30:18.583 --> 30:21.386
third, and fourth dimension
all at once?

30:21.419 --> 30:24.422
The answer to that
is a resounding yes

30:24.455 --> 30:27.826
if I place the white ball
on top of the cone,

30:27.859 --> 30:30.662
and then I cover the white ball
with the handkerchief.

30:30.695 --> 30:33.998
Now, it is incumbent upon you,
Penn and Teller

30:34.032 --> 30:37.402
to keep your eyes right here
on the white ball.

30:37.435 --> 30:39.070
I'll twist the bottom
of the handkerchief

30:39.103 --> 30:41.706
so that there is no way
for the ball to escape.

30:41.739 --> 30:43.241
Yet with a little bit of magic,

30:43.274 --> 30:45.009
the ball goes not through
the bottom of the handkerchief,

30:45.043 --> 30:49.581
but actually rises
right through the top.

30:49.614 --> 30:53.918
A solid right through
another solid.

30:53.952 --> 30:55.553
[applause]

30:55.587 --> 30:56.955
But you know,
ladies and gentlemen,

30:56.988 --> 30:59.858
this has been the story
of the fourth dimension.

30:59.891 --> 31:01.459
And the transference
of an object,

31:01.492 --> 31:03.328
in this case, the ball,

31:03.361 --> 31:07.298
backwards and forwards

31:07.332 --> 31:10.635
through the fourth dimension...

31:10.668 --> 31:15.673
to where it's all ended
here underneath the cone.

31:15.707 --> 31:19.477
And there you have the story
of the fourth dimension

31:19.510 --> 31:23.248
as told through the magic
of the ball and the cone.

31:23.281 --> 31:25.183
Thank you.
[cheers and applause]

31:25.216 --> 31:29.721
- Thomas Solomon.
[applause]

31:29.754 --> 31:32.156
So while they try
to figure out this trick,

31:32.190 --> 31:36.027
I would love to hear
about your most daring escapes.

31:36.060 --> 31:37.896
- Anytime you do water escapes,

31:37.929 --> 31:39.864
they are
by their very nature daring.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.833
I've done things where

31:41.866 --> 31:44.435
I'm jumping off a retaining
wall handcuffed into the river.

31:44.469 --> 31:47.672
So it's quite dramatic.
It's quite dangerous.

31:47.705 --> 31:50.608
And I would hazard a guess
that every one of them

31:50.642 --> 31:52.277
in their own way is daring.

31:52.310 --> 31:55.113
- Yeah, it sounds terrifying.

31:55.146 --> 31:57.348
- Well, I've been doing it
most of my life.

31:57.382 --> 32:00.285
I mean, since I was probably
about 15 or 16 years old.

32:00.318 --> 32:02.954
And it's all about
creating the illusion

32:02.987 --> 32:04.155
you're risking your life.

32:04.188 --> 32:06.291
- But even using magic,

32:06.324 --> 32:08.893
wasn't the first time you went
into the water really scary?

32:08.927 --> 32:10.662
- Oh, very much so.

32:10.695 --> 32:14.499
You can prepare for months,
years for something,

32:14.532 --> 32:16.968
but then eventually
have to go out and do it.

32:17.001 --> 32:20.471
And that can be quite
a scary experience.

32:20.505 --> 32:23.374
- I would imagine your parents
weren't too excited

32:23.408 --> 32:27.211
when a 15-year-old you decided
to do, like, water escapes?

32:27.245 --> 32:29.647
- Not at all.
My parents said, "What?"

32:29.681 --> 32:33.151
- And yet, you did.
- And yet, you did.

32:33.184 --> 32:35.987
- Okay, well, let's see if
your four-dimensional routine

32:36.020 --> 32:37.255
can earn you a trophy.

32:38.957 --> 32:43.061
- Hey Tom, it's the first thing
Teller said, we went to try to

32:43.094 --> 32:46.264
work on your routine was
he said, "I like that guy."

32:46.297 --> 32:47.999
And I said, "Me. too."

32:48.032 --> 32:52.403
It's so nice. You know, it's
good in showbiz to be flashy

32:52.437 --> 32:54.038
and come out and do big stuff,

32:54.072 --> 32:56.374
but there's also something
so nice

32:56.407 --> 32:58.176
about just having the goods

32:58.209 --> 33:00.211
and standing there
and doing it.

33:00.244 --> 33:04.949
I really like the--the
austerity and the simplicity.

33:04.983 --> 33:08.386
And the likability is
just really, really beautiful.

33:08.419 --> 33:12.724
I want to tell people
watching that Teller, I mean,

33:12.757 --> 33:15.693
I know you have the color
changes and Dai Vernon didn't,

33:15.727 --> 33:17.462
but a lot of this
was written up

33:17.495 --> 33:20.865
and certainly credited
by Dai Vernon.

33:20.898 --> 33:24.569
But Teller decided that
he was gonna learn

33:24.602 --> 33:28.039
the cone and the ball routine
from Dai Vernon.

33:28.072 --> 33:30.408
Teller worked on it a while
and gave up

33:30.441 --> 33:32.243
because it's
so [bleep]damn hard.

33:32.276 --> 33:33.378
[laughter]

33:33.411 --> 33:35.813
You are doing
bastard-hard moves.

33:35.847 --> 33:38.483
Crazy, insane, hard moves.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.551
I mean, that's a big ball

33:40.585 --> 33:42.220
to be doing the stuff
you're doing with.

33:42.253 --> 33:44.255
And the stuff, the moves,
are just beautiful

33:44.288 --> 33:47.492
and you do it so calmly.
so easily,

33:47.525 --> 33:49.527
your patter's so nice with it.

33:49.560 --> 33:52.597
Also, and I think
this seems like a minor point,

33:52.630 --> 33:54.866
but I think it may be
one of the most important,

33:54.899 --> 33:57.168
and that is that you're
the only magician

33:57.201 --> 33:59.504
that ever justified the cone.

33:59.537 --> 34:01.472
Most people just take the cone
as a given,

34:01.506 --> 34:03.441
but it works right
into your patter.

34:03.474 --> 34:05.276
So with all the shapes
and so on,

34:05.309 --> 34:08.346
there's a reason
for having that cone there,

34:08.379 --> 34:11.449
which really does inform
the whole rest of the routine

34:11.482 --> 34:13.151
and makes it
very, very beautiful.

34:13.184 --> 34:15.686
We're so, so happy to see it.

34:15.720 --> 34:17.955
And I'll tell you, Teller
would've never gotten that good

34:17.989 --> 34:19.290
if he worked the rest
of his life.

34:19.323 --> 34:20.958
[laughter]
It's really beautiful.

34:20.992 --> 34:23.661
But we do know the Dai Vernon,
we do appreciate your changes,

34:23.694 --> 34:25.129
but we also think we know them.

34:25.163 --> 34:26.164
- Yep.

34:26.197 --> 34:28.299
- So did they say
the magic words

34:28.332 --> 34:30.134
that mean they know
how you did your trick?

34:30.168 --> 34:32.737
- Yes, they did.
- Oh. Well, thank you so much.

34:32.770 --> 34:34.172
- Thank you.

34:34.205 --> 34:36.841
- Thomas Solomon.
[cheers and applause]

34:38.910 --> 34:41.412
Coming up, if you wanna see
Penn and Teller

34:41.446 --> 34:43.848
get out of those chairs
and get to work,

34:43.881 --> 34:45.216
you're in luck.

34:45.249 --> 34:47.251
Our main men in magic
do a trick of their own

34:47.285 --> 34:49.253
when "Fool Us" returns.

34:49.287 --> 34:50.555
[cheers and applause]

34:59.263 --> 35:01.933
[cheers and applause]

35:01.966 --> 35:03.634
- Welcome back to "Fool Us."

35:03.668 --> 35:04.969
When people look at Penn,

35:05.002 --> 35:08.039
they often think he isn't
playing with a full deck.

35:08.072 --> 35:10.141
Penn's here to prove
those people wrong,

35:10.174 --> 35:12.009
and he's joined
by an old friend

35:12.043 --> 35:16.013
and fellow Las Vegas headliner,
Carrot Top.

35:16.047 --> 35:19.016
[cheers and applause]
- Hello, sir. How are you?

35:19.050 --> 35:20.451
- Very well.
Thank you, thank you.

35:20.485 --> 35:21.652
- I wanna show you a trick.
- Great.

35:21.686 --> 35:23.988
- I've been working on
for 46 years.

35:24.021 --> 35:26.023
Teller and I did
our first shows together

35:26.057 --> 35:30.128
in August of 1975
in Shakopee, Minnesota.

35:30.161 --> 35:31.295
- Oh, wow, I love Shakopee.

35:31.329 --> 35:32.530
- You do love Shakopee?
- Yeah. [snores]

35:32.563 --> 35:33.531
- It's where the Minnesota
Renaissance--

35:33.564 --> 35:34.866
- No, it's great.

35:34.899 --> 35:36.634
It's a great--sorry, Shakopee.
You're out there.

35:36.667 --> 35:37.702
That was really for me snoring
at your show.

35:37.735 --> 35:39.470
It's not the city.

35:39.504 --> 35:42.173
- I would is really into
memorizing things. Still am.

35:42.206 --> 35:42.907
- Yeah. Amazing.
- I love memory stuff.

35:42.940 --> 35:44.542
I love mind games.

35:44.575 --> 35:48.312
And, Teller, we went
to the Shakopee gift shop,

35:48.346 --> 35:50.982
bought me this deck of cards
because I don't like dogs.

35:51.015 --> 35:52.550
[laughter]
So it's a nice, little puppy.

35:52.583 --> 35:55.386
And he took the cellophane off
and he shuffled.

35:55.419 --> 35:58.256
He shuffled this deck
a bunch of times and then said,

35:58.289 --> 36:01.425
"Here you go, smartass,
memorize these."

36:01.459 --> 36:03.427
So this is the order
of the deck of cards

36:03.461 --> 36:06.030
that Tellers shuffled way back
all those years ago,

36:06.063 --> 36:07.431
46 years ago.

36:07.465 --> 36:10.134
And I know where every card is
at every number.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.636
Name a card.

36:11.669 --> 36:13.704
- Any card?
- Any card.

36:13.738 --> 36:15.506
- Queen of--queen of--
queen of hearts.

36:15.540 --> 36:16.507
- Queen of hearts?
- Yeah.

36:16.541 --> 36:18.609
- That's eight in the deck.

36:18.643 --> 36:19.877
- The queen of hearts
is number eight in the deck?

36:19.911 --> 36:21.512
- Number eight in this deck.
Watch this.

36:21.546 --> 36:22.780
- How do I know you didn't have
a look through this thing?

36:22.813 --> 36:26.684
- One, two, three,

36:26.717 --> 36:30.521
four, five, six,

36:30.555 --> 36:34.492
seven, eight.

36:34.525 --> 36:35.393
Am I right?
- It's the queen of hearts.

36:35.426 --> 36:37.562
Oh, my God, that's amazing.

36:37.595 --> 36:39.630
- And I'm gonna put these back
very carefully,

36:39.664 --> 36:41.332
so I don't change the order

36:41.365 --> 36:43.568
so I could do this trick again.
And I have that exact order.

36:43.601 --> 36:44.869
- You really don't need
to do it again.

36:44.902 --> 36:48.139
- [laughs] Oh, no,
we're gonna do it again.

36:48.172 --> 36:50.841
But we're gonna do it
even better because,

36:50.875 --> 36:53.211
Teller and l have been
working together all that time.

36:53.244 --> 36:54.979
We've traveled
all over the world,

36:55.012 --> 36:56.981
but especially the U.S.

36:57.014 --> 37:00.952
And many gift shops, Teller
has bought me decks of cards.

37:00.985 --> 37:03.254
And we have ended up
over all these years--

37:03.287 --> 37:06.924
- There's Teller.
Oh, my gosh. Hi, mate.

37:06.958 --> 37:08.659
- Now these decks
are all shuffled.

37:08.693 --> 37:11.696
And they're all in an order
that I memorized.

37:11.729 --> 37:13.030
And now you got
the queen of hearts

37:13.064 --> 37:15.132
was eight
and the Shakopee deck.

37:15.166 --> 37:16.200
- Yeah.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.202
- But I can find
that queen of hearts

37:18.236 --> 37:21.272
in another deck
if you give me another number

37:21.305 --> 37:23.874
where you'd like
the queen of hearts to be.

37:23.908 --> 37:27.111
- I have--I have four letters
on my shirt.

37:27.144 --> 37:29.180
So how about four.
CTOP, four.

37:29.213 --> 37:30.548
- Four.
You wanna go with four?

37:30.581 --> 37:31.649
- Is that a good number
for you?

37:31.682 --> 37:32.850
- That would work fine.
- Okay.

37:32.883 --> 37:35.519
- So you'd want
the queen of hearts

37:35.553 --> 37:38.556
to be the fourth card there.

37:38.589 --> 37:40.524
Well, that would be
Mississippi.

37:40.558 --> 37:41.826
And that would be Tunica.

37:41.859 --> 37:44.395
And Tunica, Mississippi
It would be

37:44.428 --> 37:48.466
between the nine of spades
and the Penn and Teller card,

37:48.499 --> 37:52.236
the three of clubs.
So there's Tunica--

37:52.270 --> 37:53.838
- All right.
This is amazing.

37:53.871 --> 37:55.339
- Mississippi right there.

37:55.373 --> 37:59.310
And we have one, two, three.

37:59.343 --> 38:02.179
I said the nine of spades
and there's four.

38:02.213 --> 38:03.447
There's the queen of hearts.
[audience exclaims]

38:03.481 --> 38:05.950
And I said three of clubs
is next, didn't I?

38:05.983 --> 38:07.318
There's the three of clubs
right there.

38:07.351 --> 38:11.822
And they go very nicely
back into the collection.

38:11.856 --> 38:14.125
- Wow.
That is amazing.

38:14.158 --> 38:15.626
- Well we'll do one more thing
for you, Carrot Top.

38:15.660 --> 38:17.094
- Okay.

38:17.128 --> 38:19.430
- I'm gonna let you
pick the location.

38:19.463 --> 38:21.299
Now usually I ask people
when I'm doing this for them,

38:21.332 --> 38:22.600
where they were born,
but I know where you were born.

38:22.633 --> 38:24.302
You're an Orlando guy.
- Oh, yep. Florida.

38:24.335 --> 38:25.469
- Yeah.
- I can pick anywhere I want?

38:25.503 --> 38:26.937
- Yeah. I mean, I don't want
to go with Orlando.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.306
People will think I set it up.
- Yeah, that's true.

38:28.339 --> 38:29.940
- So any other place.
any other place there?

38:29.974 --> 38:31.309
- Do I go on the map here?
- Yeah.

38:31.342 --> 38:32.343
Go on the map
pick any place you want.

38:32.376 --> 38:33.644
- I feel like I'm gonna
spin the wheel $1.

38:33.678 --> 38:35.880
[laughter]

38:35.913 --> 38:38.015
Wow, there's so many places
that I could pick.

38:38.049 --> 38:39.650
- Yeah. There's a lot.
There's 372.

38:39.684 --> 38:41.285
- Well, can I use the ladder?
- Yes. Use the ladder.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.354
- That looks fun,
that looks fun.

38:43.387 --> 38:45.222
Let's make it dangerous.

38:45.256 --> 38:46.691
- Yeah.
- Put me on a ladder.

38:46.724 --> 38:48.559
- So why don't you step
right up there Carrot Top?

38:48.592 --> 38:50.795
- All right. I'm gonna try
to see if I can find one.

38:50.828 --> 38:52.697
Since I got the ladder.

38:52.730 --> 38:54.999
It could be Canada.

38:55.032 --> 38:57.735
♪ O Canada ♪
[laughter]

38:57.768 --> 38:59.737
♪ [vocalizing] ♪

38:59.770 --> 39:01.505
- You have rights to that,
don't you?

39:01.539 --> 39:03.774
- I have rights to it.
I'm not sure if you guys do.

39:03.808 --> 39:05.276
[laughter]
Well, since I had the ladder,

39:05.309 --> 39:08.179
I'll try to pick one
I can reach.

39:08.212 --> 39:10.348
Is that okay?
- You got Hawaii?

39:10.381 --> 39:12.783
- I got Hawaii.
- Hawaii.

39:12.817 --> 39:14.418
And that is--
which Hawaii is that?

39:14.452 --> 39:16.187
- Oh, I don't know.
Maybe look at that one.

39:16.220 --> 39:18.155
- Yeah. Okay.
I got that one.

39:18.189 --> 39:19.757
- You memorized it?
- Now bring it over here.

39:19.790 --> 39:21.625
Now you're gonna handle this.
I'm not gonna touch it.

39:21.659 --> 39:22.760
- Okay.
- That's the important part.

39:22.793 --> 39:24.328
Let's move this deck
out the way.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.597
And then give me a number.
I usually go with a birthday,

39:26.630 --> 39:27.998
but I don't want to go
with the birthday with you

39:28.032 --> 39:29.800
'cause I might know that.
I don't.

39:29.834 --> 39:32.002
- Seven Vegas.
Seven, baby.

39:32.036 --> 39:34.004
- Okay. So seven in that deck,

39:34.038 --> 39:37.942
seven is the nine of spades.

39:37.975 --> 39:39.643
- Okay.

39:39.677 --> 39:41.345
- So go ahead with the nine
of spades right there.

39:41.379 --> 39:44.281
Count seven. Now count 'em
from the top down, face-up.

39:44.315 --> 39:46.217
One.
- Okay.

39:46.250 --> 39:48.018
both: Two.
- Three.

39:48.052 --> 39:49.186
- I don't know.
Don't yell at me.

39:49.220 --> 39:52.890
both: Four, five, six.

39:52.923 --> 39:55.192
- I said nine of spades,
nine of spades.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.060
- This is it, this is it?
- This is it.

39:56.093 --> 39:57.495
Nine of spades.
Show it.

39:57.528 --> 39:58.496
- Whoa.
- Nine of spades.

39:58.529 --> 39:59.497
Keep going, keep going.

39:59.530 --> 40:01.065
- Oh, my God.
You're right.

40:01.098 --> 40:03.167
- That's the queen hearts,
three of clubs,

40:03.200 --> 40:05.469
then it's the ten of clubs,
ten of clubs is next.

40:05.503 --> 40:07.204
Then it's the king of spades,
is next.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.572
And then it's
the ace of hearts.

40:08.606 --> 40:10.341
And then it's
the four of diamonds.

40:10.374 --> 40:12.143
Then it's the jack of diamonds.
Then it's the king of diamonds.

40:12.176 --> 40:14.845
Keep going. King of hearts,
two of diamonds.

40:14.879 --> 40:16.347
Then it's the queen of clubs.

40:16.380 --> 40:19.316
Nine of clubs, ten of hearts,
eight of diamonds,

40:19.350 --> 40:23.020
two of clubs, ace of clubs,
and so on.

40:23.053 --> 40:24.388
- Wow.
That's--I am way behind.

40:24.422 --> 40:25.356
- Seven oh hearts,
seven of clubs.

40:25.389 --> 40:27.391
What I do for you right now,
Carrot Top

40:27.425 --> 40:28.592
'cause you're a friend,

40:28.626 --> 40:30.161
I'm gonna put these back
in the same order.

40:30.194 --> 40:31.495
You didn't mess 'em up did you?
- I did not mess 'em up.

40:31.529 --> 40:32.696
- You were careful.
- Think I was very good.

40:32.730 --> 40:37.334
- I'm gonna put this
in the Hawaii box.

40:37.368 --> 40:40.037
And then if you keep these
in this order, Carrot Top...

40:40.070 --> 40:41.238
- You'll give me a trip
to Hawaii?

40:41.272 --> 40:42.573
- For the rest
of our lives--no,

40:42.606 --> 40:44.241
no trip to Hawaii.
For the rest of our lives,

40:44.275 --> 40:45.876
if you have this deck with you,

40:45.910 --> 40:48.045
you can give me any number
or any card
