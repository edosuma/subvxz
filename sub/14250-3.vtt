00:02.100 --> 00:03.100
New man coming!

00:03.100 --> 00:05.300
New prisoner!
Get out of my way!

00:05.300 --> 00:06.800
New man coming!

00:06.900 --> 00:08.400
Get out of my way!

00:10.000 --> 00:12.600
Here he comes!
Get ready! Let's go!

00:12.600 --> 00:13.600
Hurry up!

00:13.700 --> 00:14.700
They're gonna push off!
Let's go!

00:14.700 --> 00:15.700
New prisoner!

00:15.700 --> 00:18.400
Hey!
Something's coming down there!

00:36.300 --> 00:39.100
Hey, get out of my...

01:09.600 --> 01:10.800
KiII him! KiII him!

01:16.500 --> 01:17.700
Tom!

03:26.300 --> 03:28.300
Nobody touch him.
He's mine.

03:38.200 --> 03:41.700
Wait. This is a mistake.

03:41.700 --> 03:42.900
I don't beIong here!

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
You don't?

03:45.100 --> 03:47.600
WeII, I'II just take
you home, then.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.100
AII right?!

03:53.200 --> 03:55.500
This one's mine.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.900
I say he's not.

03:57.900 --> 04:01.300
He's the reason that I'm here.

04:01.300 --> 04:05.000
He was my partner in a bombing.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.200
We kiIIed 47 patroIIers
on Akritiri-- 47!

04:09.200 --> 04:12.900
And then this scum
confessed to the tribunaI

04:12.900 --> 04:14.400
and gave them my name.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.000
So I'm teIIing you again,

04:16.100 --> 04:17.700
he's mine.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.000
I'm keeping him.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.100
Take him.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.000
For now.

04:52.700 --> 04:55.100
Did you have to hit me so hard?

04:55.200 --> 04:56.700
Trust me-- around here

04:56.800 --> 04:59.300
you don't want anybody
thinking you're soft.

04:59.300 --> 05:00.600
Thanks for the tip.

05:00.600 --> 05:01.900
Is there any food?

05:01.900 --> 05:04.900
I haven't had anything
to eat since I got here.

05:04.900 --> 05:06.000
How Iong is that?

05:06.100 --> 05:08.200
A coupIe of days.

05:08.300 --> 05:10.400
Some shore Ieave, huh?

05:10.500 --> 05:13.200
What happened to you
after they spIit us up?

05:13.200 --> 05:17.600
The Akritirians interrogated me.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.700
When I wouIdn't confess
to the bombing,

05:19.700 --> 05:22.500
they dragged me
in front of a judge.

05:22.600 --> 05:25.500
He said you'd aIready
confessed for the both of us

05:25.500 --> 05:27.400
and then
he pronounced me guiIty.

05:27.400 --> 05:29.000
That's exactIy
what happened to me.

05:29.100 --> 05:32.600
Then they must have drugged me
because the next thing I knew,

05:32.600 --> 05:34.800
I woke up
at the bottom of the chute

05:34.900 --> 05:36.200
to that weIcoming party.

05:36.200 --> 05:40.800
We've got to expIain to somebody
that there's been a mistake.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.000
Who did you have in mind?

05:43.100 --> 05:44.400
A guard.

05:44.400 --> 05:45.600
The warden.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.500
I haven't seen
anybody Iike that.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.600
A prison without guards?

05:50.700 --> 05:53.300
The other inmates say

05:53.300 --> 05:55.800
this pIace
is 300 meters underground.

05:55.800 --> 05:59.800
Maybe the Akritirians figure
guards aren't necessary.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.500
Can I have some more?

06:01.500 --> 06:03.300
What do you think this is?!

06:03.400 --> 06:05.000
A hoteI?!
There isn't any more!

06:05.100 --> 06:07.400
Take it easy!

06:14.400 --> 06:16.900
I'm sorry.

06:16.900 --> 06:20.800
I'm...
reaIIy starting to get edgy.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.800
I think it's the cIamp.

06:22.800 --> 06:23.900
The what?

06:27.100 --> 06:29.700
That's what the prisoners
caII it.

06:29.700 --> 06:31.200
Everybody has one.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.600
What is it?

06:34.600 --> 06:38.400
I'm guessing it's some kind
of synaptic stimuIator.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.600
Anyway, it's affecting
my nervous system.

06:41.600 --> 06:44.300
I've been getting jumpier
ever since I got here.

06:44.300 --> 06:47.300
Not to mention,
this thing itches Iike crazy.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.500
What do you think it's for?

06:48.500 --> 06:51.300
Maybe it's some kind
of torture device.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.400
We couId try taking them out.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.300
No! I saw someone try it.

06:55.300 --> 06:57.000
It kiIIed him.

07:02.300 --> 07:07.500
What we have to do
is find a way out of this pIace.

07:09.100 --> 07:10.200
Hmm.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.800
Let's get something
straight first.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.900
What?

07:17.000 --> 07:20.300
The next time you take
a swing at me,

07:20.300 --> 07:22.200
I'm hitting back.

07:26.200 --> 07:27.700
What's that?

07:27.800 --> 07:30.400
Another prisoner, maybe?

07:30.500 --> 07:32.700
Food coming!

07:32.700 --> 07:34.300
-Food!
-Join me for dinner?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.700
No! There's got to be more!

08:04.300 --> 08:06.500
I don't think he was going
to eat it anyway, do you?

08:12.700 --> 08:14.300
He's dead.

08:15.600 --> 08:18.800
I think I've Iost my appetite.

08:24.500 --> 08:28.300
Captain's Log, Stardate 50156.2.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.000
After 72 hours,
Lieutenant Paris

08:30.100 --> 08:32.000
and Ensign Kim
are stiII missing,

08:32.100 --> 08:33.799
and I'm quickIy Iosing patience

08:33.799 --> 08:35.600
with the Akritirian authorities.

08:35.700 --> 08:37.600
They continue to deny us
access to the surface,

08:37.600 --> 08:39.400
and they've yet to confirm

08:39.400 --> 08:42.100
whether our crewmen
were kiIIed in the bombing.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.600
Anything?

08:43.600 --> 08:45.900
I have compIeted another
fuII sensor sweep

08:46.000 --> 08:48.200
incIuding a muItispectraI
subsurface scan.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.800
I stiII cannot Iocate
their Iife signs

08:49.900 --> 08:51.400
or their combadges.

08:51.400 --> 08:55.100
Captain, Ambassador Liria
is haiIing us.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.400
On screen.

08:57.400 --> 09:00.300
I'm onIy in the mood
for good news today, Ambassador.

09:00.300 --> 09:02.400
I'm afraid I can't obIige.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.300
Are you saying they're dead?

09:04.400 --> 09:06.600
No, they're very much aIive.

09:06.600 --> 09:09.200
Then where are they?

09:09.200 --> 09:12.500
Your men have been convicted
of the terrorist bombing

09:12.500 --> 09:15.500
at the Laktivia recreationaI
faciIity, which resuIted

09:15.500 --> 09:18.800
in the death of 47
off-duty patroIIers.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.300
I assure you, Ambassador,

09:21.300 --> 09:23.800
my peopIe had nothing to do
with this attack.

09:23.900 --> 09:25.400
We found chemicaI traces

09:25.400 --> 09:27.400
of the expIosive used
in the bombing

09:27.500 --> 09:29.600
on their hands and cIothing.

09:29.700 --> 09:30.900
I'm sure the same couId be said

09:30.900 --> 09:32.500
of anyone who was near
the expIosion.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.500
It's hardIy enough evidence
for a conviction.

09:34.500 --> 09:38.100
The expIosive
was triIithium based.

09:38.200 --> 09:41.400
There is no source of triIithium
anywhere in our system.

09:41.400 --> 09:46.000
So, you can imagine our surprise
when our investigation reveaIed

09:46.100 --> 09:48.800
that your ship is powered
by diIithium--

09:48.800 --> 09:54.400
which our scientists teII us is
convertibIe into triIithium.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.400
We have Iong suspected

09:56.400 --> 09:58.700
that the so-caIIed
Open Sky terrorists

09:58.700 --> 10:01.700
had off-worId coIIaborators.

10:01.700 --> 10:04.000
Now we know who they are.

10:04.100 --> 10:07.300
Captain, two Akritirian ships
are approaching

10:07.300 --> 10:09.400
at bearing 27 1 mark 64.

10:09.400 --> 10:12.700
Prepare your ship
for inspection, Captain.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.500
If it wiII heIp confirm
our innocence, I'II consider it.

10:15.500 --> 10:18.300
But first, I want to know
where my peopIe are being heId,

10:18.300 --> 10:20.200
and I want to taIk
to them immediateIy.

10:20.200 --> 10:23.000
Communication with inmates
is not permitted.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.000
If you want my cooperation,
Ambassador,

10:25.100 --> 10:27.600
you're going to have
to do better than that.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.400
Perhaps you've misunderstood me.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.700
Let me cIarify our position.

10:31.700 --> 10:33.500
Your vesseI is being impounded.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.900
You and your crew
are under arrest.

10:35.900 --> 10:37.400
Prepare to be boarded.

10:37.400 --> 10:40.200
Captain, their ships
are powering weapons.

10:40.300 --> 10:42.300
Mr. Tuvok, raise shieIds.

10:42.300 --> 10:44.100
Mr. Chakotay, take the conn.

10:44.100 --> 10:45.700
I'd Iike to resoIve
this situation

10:45.700 --> 10:47.100
peacefuIIy, Ambassador,

10:47.200 --> 10:49.500
but Iet me cIarify my position.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.000
I wiII not aIIow
this ship to be boarded.

10:52.100 --> 10:56.300
That, Captain,
is an error in judgment.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.800
Captain, shouId I return fire?

11:06.800 --> 11:09.400
That's not going to heIp us
get Tom and Harry back.

11:09.400 --> 11:10.400
We need to regroup.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.800
Get us out of here, Commander.

11:11.900 --> 11:13.000
Aye, Captain.

11:37.400 --> 11:38.700
What took you so Iong?

11:38.700 --> 11:40.900
I've been back
at Ieast haIf an hour.

11:40.900 --> 11:44.900
You're starting to
feeI it, aren't you?

11:44.900 --> 11:46.400
I guess I am.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.300
It gets worse aII the time.

11:48.300 --> 11:49.800
We have to fight it.

11:51.500 --> 11:53.600
Let's focus
on something positive.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.900
How about...

11:57.900 --> 12:00.500
a seven-course dinner?

12:02.200 --> 12:04.400
I suppose you didn't
find any food.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.200
WeII... I found cIose
to 50 good citizens

12:07.200 --> 12:11.400
in this quaint IittIe community,
but not a grocer among them.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.300
I take it that's a no.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.500
Yeah.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.800
But, if we ever do get
our hands on some food,

12:17.800 --> 12:20.400
I found a IoveIy
spot for a picnic.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.400
Great.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.000
AII we need
are the DeIaney sisters,

12:24.100 --> 12:26.300
and we couId make a day of it.

12:28.100 --> 12:29.200
So, how about you?

12:29.200 --> 12:32.100
Come across anything interesting
in your traveIs?

12:32.200 --> 12:33.700
If you mean an escape route,

12:33.700 --> 12:35.700
I ran into nothing
but soIid waIIs.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.500
Me, too.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.800
As far as I can see,
the onIy way to the surface

12:40.800 --> 12:42.600
is that chute
in the main chamber.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.600
The question is:
How do we get into it

12:44.600 --> 12:47.000
without getting fried
by that force fieId?

12:47.100 --> 12:50.200
You saw what happened
to the man who reached inside.

12:50.300 --> 12:52.300
That's where this
might come in handy.

12:52.400 --> 12:55.800
I thought if we couId get
our hands on some Ioose wiring,

12:55.900 --> 12:57.400
you might be abIe to use it
to rig a device

12:57.500 --> 12:59.300
that wouId short out
the force fieId

12:59.300 --> 13:01.100
Iong enough for us
to get into the tube.

13:01.100 --> 13:03.500
It's worth a try.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.000
Yeah.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.400
Now, if we couId onIy
figure out a way

13:07.500 --> 13:10.400
to short out these impIants,
we'd be aII set.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.700
There's no indication
they foIIowed us.

13:15.800 --> 13:16.900
I guess they're more interested

13:16.900 --> 13:18.600
in getting rid of us
than finding out the truth.

13:18.700 --> 13:19.600
We've got to go back

13:19.700 --> 13:21.000
-for Harry and Tom.
-B'EIanna...

13:21.100 --> 13:23.400
We have no information
as to their whereabouts,

13:23.400 --> 13:24.700
and if we return
to Akritirian space,

13:24.700 --> 13:26.800
we are sure to encounter
further hostiIities.

13:26.800 --> 13:27.900
Tuvok is right.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.400
Let's concentrate on proving
Harry and Tom's innocence.

13:30.400 --> 13:31.700
How do we do that?

13:31.700 --> 13:33.700
We know the expIosive
was triIithium-based.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.700
If we find the source
of that triIithium,

13:35.700 --> 13:37.300
it may Iead us
to the reaI bombers.

13:37.300 --> 13:39.300
Our Iong-range scans indicate
that Liria was right.

13:39.300 --> 13:41.200
There's no triIithium
in this sector.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.300
What about paraIithium?

13:44.300 --> 13:45.300
It's used as a fueI

13:45.400 --> 13:47.300
for some ion-based
propuIsion systems

13:47.300 --> 13:49.600
and it can be converted
into triIithium.

13:49.700 --> 13:51.000
Review our sensor Iogs

13:51.000 --> 13:53.800
of ships entering and Ieaving
Akritirian space

13:53.800 --> 13:55.800
during the time
we were in orbit.

13:55.800 --> 13:58.200
If anybody's using
paraIithium for fueI,

13:58.200 --> 14:01.300
I want to find out who they are
and where they went.

14:05.900 --> 14:08.900
Come on, come on, come on...

14:08.900 --> 14:11.000
Take it easy.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.700
You'II get it.

14:23.400 --> 14:26.500
I can't think.
I can't concentrate.

14:26.500 --> 14:29.400
Okay, okay, concentrate on this.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.500
Uh... um...

14:32.600 --> 14:34.500
crown roast of Iamb

14:34.600 --> 14:37.500
with, uh... a bed of wiId rice

14:37.600 --> 14:41.500
and a 2296 Chateau
Lafite RothschiId...

14:41.600 --> 14:44.900
at the reaI Sandrine's.

14:46.300 --> 14:50.100
Or how about shrimp
with fettran sauce,

14:50.100 --> 14:51.800
fIamb? noodIes...

14:51.900 --> 14:56.200
and fudge rippIe pudding.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.200
Good one.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.300
Okay. Uh...

14:59.300 --> 15:02.600
coupIe of barbecued
T-bone steaks

15:02.600 --> 15:04.800
with baked Risan beans

15:04.900 --> 15:07.900
and... cherry pie for dessert.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.900
Let's see you top that one.

15:10.100 --> 15:11.600
Right now, I'm so hungry,

15:11.700 --> 15:14.900
I couId eat a bowI of
NeeIix's leola root stew.

15:14.900 --> 15:16.500
Me, too.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.700
Never thought I'd say that.

15:19.700 --> 15:22.100
I'm ready to give it a try.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.600
So far, so good.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.100
Are you okay?

15:35.100 --> 15:37.200
What are you doing?

15:37.200 --> 15:39.400
Just out for a IittIe stroII.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.100
Move it!

15:43.100 --> 15:45.000
What's that?

15:45.100 --> 15:47.000
A pipe.

15:47.100 --> 15:48.900
Let's see it.

15:48.900 --> 15:50.000
Come on.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.600
I'd reaIIy recommend
that you stay out of my way.

15:53.600 --> 15:57.100
You shouId have thought of that
before you took him!

16:08.200 --> 16:09.300
Come on, Tom.

16:17.500 --> 16:18.300
Tom!

16:31.700 --> 16:37.400
Back off! Back off!
Back off! Back off!

16:41.400 --> 16:45.000
Hang on. I'm getting
you out of here.

16:45.100 --> 16:47.700
No fight. No fight.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.600
If he doesn't bIeed to death,
he'II die from infection.

16:53.700 --> 16:55.000
We've got to get him
to a doctor.

16:55.100 --> 16:56.700
Of course. We'II caII
an emergency vehicIe

16:56.700 --> 16:58.200
and rush him to a hospitaI.

17:09.400 --> 17:10.500
Hey!

17:12.400 --> 17:14.700
What do you want
for the dead man's boots?

17:28.600 --> 17:30.100
You can make it.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.200
Just a few more steps,

17:31.300 --> 17:33.400
and we'II be back
to the sheIter.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.800
Home, sweet home.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.200
Harry.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.300
Yeah.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.600
I'm hurt pretty bad.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.400
I'II take care of it.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.600
Promise me something.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.800
What?

17:47.800 --> 17:50.100
If things get worse...

17:50.100 --> 17:53.200
if it comes down
to making a choice,

17:53.300 --> 17:55.500
don't worry about me.

17:55.600 --> 17:58.600
Take care of yourseIf.

18:03.300 --> 18:04.900
Do we have a deaI?

18:06.200 --> 18:08.500
Quiet.

18:09.500 --> 18:10.900
Hey!

18:11.000 --> 18:12.800
What are you doing in there?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.800
-Get out.
-This pIace is ours.

18:14.900 --> 18:17.800
Get out! Get out!
Get out!

18:33.500 --> 18:35.900
Okay, here's the deaI.

18:35.900 --> 18:38.500
My boots for some cIean cIoth,

18:38.500 --> 18:40.800
a Iiter of water,
two of those food cakes

18:40.900 --> 18:43.000
and my friend gets to stay
in there untiI he's better.

18:45.100 --> 18:47.600
I don't take in boarders.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.300
What about the rest of it?

18:52.400 --> 18:54.000
I don't Iike the coIor.

18:54.100 --> 18:57.000
Come on, Iet's go.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.600
This guy's not going to heIp us.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.100
Just teII me what you want

19:02.200 --> 19:04.400
for the food
and the bandages, okay?

19:05.800 --> 19:08.800
That pipe you were working with
interests me.

19:08.900 --> 19:10.800
I can't trade the pipe.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.800
Then I guess
we don't have a deaI.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.100
Now move on.
You're bIocking my Iight.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.700
I'II take you with me.

19:19.800 --> 19:22.600
Take me where?

19:22.600 --> 19:25.100
I know a way out of this pIace.

19:25.100 --> 19:26.600
I been in here six years.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.500
I've never heard of a way out.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.900
The chute.

19:31.300 --> 19:33.300
Anybody that tries
to get in there

19:33.300 --> 19:35.100
gets hit with an energy puIse.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.600
With this pipe,
I can disabIe the force fieId.

19:37.700 --> 19:40.500
With a IittIe Iuck,
we can make it to the surface.

19:49.100 --> 19:50.600
What are you staring at?

19:50.600 --> 19:54.100
I'm trying to figure out
if you're a Iiar...

19:54.100 --> 19:56.700
or if the cIamp has
aIready made you crazy.

19:56.700 --> 19:57.700
Neither.

19:57.700 --> 19:59.900
And I'II prove it to you.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.000
You stand your ground.

20:03.100 --> 20:04.100
I Iike that.

20:04.100 --> 20:06.700
Then we have a deaI?

20:06.700 --> 20:09.600
Just remember one thing:

20:11.700 --> 20:15.500
If you're Iying, I'II kiII you.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.200
Captain's Log, suppIementaI.

20:20.200 --> 20:22.600
So far, we've Iocated
three ships

20:22.600 --> 20:24.900
with paraIithium pIasma
emissions,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.600
but none of them appears
to have produced expIosives.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.900
We're currentIy in pursuit
of a fourth vesseI.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.400
We're in haiIing range

20:31.400 --> 20:33.300
of the Akritirian
freighter, Captain.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.500
I'm onIy reading
two Iife signs aboard.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.000
Open a channeI.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.500
This is Kathryn Janeway

20:38.500 --> 20:40.700
of the Federation
Starship Voyager

20:40.700 --> 20:43.800
to the Captain
of the Akritirian cargo vesseI.

20:44.500 --> 20:45.500
I'm the Captain of this vesseI.

20:45.600 --> 20:46.700
What do you want?

20:46.700 --> 20:49.200
Two of my crew members
were convicted

20:49.200 --> 20:51.600
by the Akritirians
of a terrorist bombing.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.800
We're trying to prove
their innocence

20:53.800 --> 20:56.700
and we have reason to beIieve
a ship Iike yours,

20:56.700 --> 21:00.100
which uses paraIithium for fueI,
might have been invoIved

21:00.200 --> 21:02.300
in the production
of the expIosives.

21:02.400 --> 21:03.800
Let's get out of here.

21:03.800 --> 21:04.800
Quiet.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.600
This is a cargo vesseI.

21:06.600 --> 21:08.400
Then you won't mind
if a few of my crew members

21:08.400 --> 21:09.700
come aboard to have
a Iook around.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.800
Not if they don't mind
having their throats cut.

21:11.900 --> 21:13.600
There's no need to be abrupt...

21:17.000 --> 21:18.200
I guess you're not
the onIy captain

21:18.200 --> 21:19.900
who doesn't want
their ship boarded.

21:19.900 --> 21:24.000
Captain, I'm picking up
residuaI traces of triIithium.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.100
They're faint,
but they're there.

21:26.200 --> 21:29.600
I think we may have found
our bomb makers.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.200
Mr. Tuvok, send
a security detaiI

21:31.200 --> 21:32.800
to Transporter Room 2.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.200
Lieutenant Torres,
beam the two of them aboard

21:35.300 --> 21:37.200
and tractor their ship
into the shuttIe bay.

21:37.200 --> 21:38.900
Aye, Captain.

21:44.500 --> 21:46.300
You have no right to hoId us.

21:46.300 --> 21:47.700
My peopIe have been accused

21:47.700 --> 21:50.100
of aiding a terrorist group
caIIed Open Sky.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.600
What do you know about them?

21:51.600 --> 21:52.800
They're not terrorists.

21:52.900 --> 21:53.800
They're patriots.

21:53.900 --> 21:55.000
One day, they'II Iead

21:55.000 --> 21:57.100
the Iegitimate government
of our peopIe.

21:57.200 --> 21:58.300
We don't have

21:58.400 --> 22:00.500
to answer any
of their questions, Piri.

22:00.500 --> 22:03.000
It sounds to me
Iike your young friend here

22:03.000 --> 22:04.800
sympathizes with these patriots.

22:04.900 --> 22:06.000
She's not my friend.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.300
She's my sister.

22:07.300 --> 22:10.300
And our poIiticaI views
are none of your business.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.700
I don't know much
about your worId...

22:13.800 --> 22:15.000
but I do know that my peopIe

22:15.000 --> 22:16.900
are being heId
for a crime they didn't commit

22:16.900 --> 22:19.500
and I'm going to do everything
in my power to get them out.

22:19.500 --> 22:20.800
Do you understand that?

22:20.800 --> 22:22.600
We have confirmed
that expIosives

22:22.600 --> 22:25.600
were indeed produced
aboard their ship.

22:25.700 --> 22:27.100
Escort them to the brig.

22:27.200 --> 22:28.600
Aye, Captain.

22:28.700 --> 22:30.900
And have Mr. Chakotay
Iay in a course

22:31.000 --> 22:32.600
for the Akritirian border.

22:32.600 --> 22:33.800
Let my sister go.

22:33.900 --> 22:35.500
She didn't have anything
to do with the bombing,

22:35.500 --> 22:36.800
and she's onIy 14.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.600
Prison doesn't scare me.

22:38.600 --> 22:39.600
Quiet, Piri.

22:39.600 --> 22:40.600
PIease.

22:40.600 --> 22:43.100
You don't know
what you're saying.

22:43.200 --> 22:46.400
Nobody ever gets out
of prison on Akritiri.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.800
They'II just
Iet her rot in there

22:48.900 --> 22:50.700
for the rest of her Iife.

22:50.700 --> 22:54.000
I admire your desire
to protect your sister, but...

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
it's not reaIIy up to me, is it?

22:56.100 --> 22:57.600
TeII them what we know.

22:57.600 --> 22:58.700
TeII me what?

22:58.800 --> 22:59.600
Piri, don't.

22:59.700 --> 23:01.300
Our brigade found out

23:01.300 --> 23:05.200
where the maximum security
detention faciIity is Iocated.

23:05.300 --> 23:08.100
My sister has quite
a vivid imagination.

23:08.100 --> 23:10.700
With this ship, you
can attack the prison

23:10.700 --> 23:12.300
and get your peopIe out.

23:12.300 --> 23:13.500
I'm sorry,

23:13.500 --> 23:17.100
that's not how we do things
where I come from.

23:17.100 --> 23:18.200
Coward.

23:21.500 --> 23:28.700
Mr. Tuvok, see that they get
a bath and a hot meaI.

23:36.800 --> 23:39.600
I don't trust that guy, Harry.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.300
I can handIe him.

23:41.300 --> 23:43.800
Just watch your back, okay?

23:43.800 --> 23:46.300
Try to get some rest.

23:46.300 --> 23:48.300
Remember our deaI?

23:48.300 --> 23:49.800
What deaI?

23:49.800 --> 23:51.000
If it comes down to it,

23:51.000 --> 23:53.100
you're going to save
yourseIf, right?

23:54.800 --> 23:56.000
If you see a chance,

23:56.100 --> 23:57.200
just go.

23:57.300 --> 23:59.500
Don't come back for me.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.300
I think the cIamp

24:01.400 --> 24:03.900
must reaIIy be starting
to make you crazy.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.300
I'm serious, Harry.

24:05.300 --> 24:07.600
Getting tired of waiting.

24:10.500 --> 24:11.600
I gotta go.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.800
Harry...

24:21.800 --> 24:23.800
Oh! Damn it!

24:23.800 --> 24:26.000
Don't fight it, use it.

24:27.100 --> 24:28.300
How do I do that?

24:28.300 --> 24:31.900
I feeI Iike there's
a miIIion fire ants in my brain.

24:31.900 --> 24:34.900
Good. Make them work for you.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.100
How?

24:37.100 --> 24:39.400
Fire ants sound vicious.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.000
Imagine them as your army

24:41.000 --> 24:43.700
moving in a vast wave
to conquer your enemy.

24:43.700 --> 24:46.600
There's a massive struggIe
going on inside you--

24:46.600 --> 24:49.500
a battIe to the death
between you and the cIamp.

24:49.600 --> 24:52.700
You have to use whatever force
you can to defeat it.

24:52.800 --> 24:56.400
I'd rather use my energy
to work on getting out of here.

25:00.400 --> 25:03.900
When I first got here,
I assumed the cIamp

25:03.900 --> 25:06.800
was just a refined form
of torture

25:06.800 --> 25:10.700
to make our prison stay
that much more arduous.

25:10.800 --> 25:16.600
GraduaIIy, I began
to understand it more fuIIy.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.700
It's aII right here
in my manifesto--

25:18.800 --> 25:20.500
my insights, my reasoning...

25:22.100 --> 25:25.400
...my evidence.

25:25.500 --> 25:27.600
It's an experiment.

25:27.600 --> 25:31.400
They're studying us
Iike animaIs--

25:31.500 --> 25:34.900
pitting us against each other
to find out what happens.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.800
You can see that, can't you?

25:38.600 --> 25:40.100
I guess so.

25:40.100 --> 25:42.400
The greatest threat,
of course, wouId be

25:42.500 --> 25:44.000
if we started to cooperate
with each other,

25:44.000 --> 25:47.400
so they prevented that.

25:47.500 --> 25:49.600
But there had to be
more to it than that,

25:49.600 --> 25:51.000
and the Ionger I was in here,

25:51.100 --> 25:53.000
the more I knew it was my job
to figure it out.

25:53.100 --> 25:56.700
That's the reason I was put here
and eventuaIIy...

25:58.000 --> 26:00.400
...it came to me

26:00.400 --> 26:06.400
as though a firebaII
had expIoded in my mind.

26:06.400 --> 26:11.700
And the reaIization gave me
a power over the others.

26:11.800 --> 26:14.700
They don't come near me anymore.

26:14.800 --> 26:19.600
They're afraid of me,
because I know the truth.

26:22.300 --> 26:23.200
WeII?

26:23.300 --> 26:26.000
Don't you want to know
what it is?

26:26.000 --> 26:29.100
What is the uItimate purpose
of the cIamp?

26:29.100 --> 26:31.100
Okay.

26:35.300 --> 26:38.800
It's inspired, briIIiant.

26:38.800 --> 26:42.800
It's a method for controIIing
the prison popuIation.

26:42.800 --> 26:45.900
We kiII each other off.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.600
Sure. Whatever you say.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.500
So you must enter
into the battIe.

26:50.600 --> 26:52.300
If you Iet the cIamp
controI you,

26:52.400 --> 26:54.500
you'II end up
Iike that crazy oId man

26:54.500 --> 26:56.000
that took over your sheIter.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
But if you Iearn to controI it,
you'II survive...

26:59.100 --> 27:01.100
Iike me.

27:08.900 --> 27:10.700
Yes.

27:10.700 --> 27:15.500
I pIan to be out of here
before it even becomes an issue.

27:15.500 --> 27:17.000
Go ahead.

27:17.100 --> 27:18.500
Touch it.

28:10.500 --> 28:12.000
What do you see?

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Some kind of hatch.

28:25.100 --> 28:27.000
What do you see?

28:27.100 --> 28:29.000
Are we at the surface?

28:54.700 --> 28:56.200
Harry.

28:57.400 --> 28:59.000
How are you feeIing?

29:02.200 --> 29:04.100
I was dreaming...

29:05.600 --> 29:07.500
about Megan DeIaney.

29:09.600 --> 29:12.500
Next time,
I'II try not to wake you.

29:16.300 --> 29:18.800
The chute...

29:18.800 --> 29:20.500
you made it in?

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Did you find a way out?

29:29.000 --> 29:30.800
Not yet...

29:30.800 --> 29:32.600
but we're very cIose.

29:32.700 --> 29:34.600
It's just a matter of time.

29:34.700 --> 29:37.300
So you've got
to hang in there, okay?

29:51.400 --> 29:53.400
Wh... Wha...

29:53.400 --> 29:54.800
What happened to me?

29:54.800 --> 29:56.300
Easy, Tom.

29:56.300 --> 29:58.300
You got stabbed, remember?

29:58.300 --> 30:01.800
Who... who did it?

30:01.800 --> 30:03.400
One of the prisoners.

30:03.500 --> 30:05.300
No, it...

30:05.400 --> 30:06.700
No, it was you.

30:06.800 --> 30:09.700
I'm trying
to change your bandage.

30:09.800 --> 30:10.800
No! Get away from me!

30:10.900 --> 30:12.800
-PIease! I'm trying to heIp you.
-Get away from me!

30:12.900 --> 30:14.700
Tom!

30:14.800 --> 30:16.300
Tom, give me the pipe.

30:18.100 --> 30:21.400
We need it to get out of here.
Remember?

30:22.700 --> 30:24.900
It's okay.

30:24.900 --> 30:27.700
Let me take it.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.200
Harry...

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
...what's happening to me?

30:59.000 --> 31:01.200
You're gonna be okay.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.500
Harry.

31:09.500 --> 31:11.000
Yeah.

31:11.100 --> 31:14.800
Don't Ieave me here.

31:32.900 --> 31:34.900
CIose your eyes.

32:12.700 --> 32:14.400
SIeep weII?

32:15.500 --> 32:16.800
No.

32:16.900 --> 32:18.200
How about your friend?

32:18.200 --> 32:20.000
Is he dead yet?

32:20.100 --> 32:21.500
Shut up!

32:29.100 --> 32:32.400
The chute Ieads
to a docking port, right?

32:33.600 --> 32:36.900
Some kind of ship must come
to drop off food...

32:36.900 --> 32:38.500
drop off new prisoners.

32:38.600 --> 32:41.200
So maybe we couId
get aboard the ship.

32:41.200 --> 32:43.200
It's getting the best of you.

32:43.200 --> 32:44.500
I know we couId do it.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.100
You think they're just
gonna open the hatch

32:46.100 --> 32:47.400
and ask us if we'd
Iike a ride home?!

32:47.400 --> 32:50.100
We'd have
the eIement of surprise.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.500
And they'd have the puIse guns.

33:00.200 --> 33:02.900
If we couId hoId them off...

33:04.200 --> 33:05.900
...distract them...

33:06.900 --> 33:08.700
...just for a few minutes...

33:09.900 --> 33:12.000
I couId
estabIish our Iocation...

33:12.000 --> 33:13.500
That's enough!

33:13.500 --> 33:16.000
...get a message to Voyager

33:16.000 --> 33:18.700
and they couId
get us out of here.

33:18.700 --> 33:20.300
We'II need weapons.

33:20.400 --> 33:23.900
I've never
Iet anyone see this...

33:24.000 --> 33:27.200
but I'm going to Iet you read
my manifesto.

33:27.200 --> 33:30.200
It'II teach you
how to controI the cIamp.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.200
I don't want to read
your crazy manifesto.

33:35.200 --> 33:36.700
Take it.

33:36.800 --> 33:38.300
Learn everything I know.

33:38.400 --> 33:41.800
Now, are you going
to heIp me or not?!

33:45.900 --> 33:48.100
If I were Iike the others...

33:50.300 --> 33:52.000
...I'd kiII you.

33:53.500 --> 33:55.800
But I don't Iose controI.

33:55.800 --> 34:00.200
That's the difference
between me and you.

34:11.100 --> 34:13.400
Listen!
Listen to me, everybody!

34:13.400 --> 34:14.400
Now what's he want?

34:14.400 --> 34:15.500
This is important.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.100
I've got something to say.

34:17.100 --> 34:19.199
Something you want to hear.

34:19.199 --> 34:20.900
It's what you've
been waiting for.

34:20.900 --> 34:22.600
What the heII do you want?

34:24.000 --> 34:25.699
I've found a way out of here.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.900
There's no way out.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.600
There is!

34:32.699 --> 34:34.199
Through the chute!

34:34.199 --> 34:35.600
I've been inside.

34:37.500 --> 34:38.800
Listen!

34:38.800 --> 34:41.900
We have to work together.

34:41.900 --> 34:44.500
They'd Iike us aII
to kiII each other,

34:44.600 --> 34:46.900
but we have to cooperate.

34:46.900 --> 34:49.800
If we do,
we can get out of here.

34:49.800 --> 34:52.100
If you've been in the chute,

34:52.199 --> 34:53.800
where does it Iead?

34:55.199 --> 34:56.800
Space.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.300
It's the truth.

35:04.300 --> 35:06.000
We can escape...

35:07.800 --> 35:10.300
...if we work together!

35:29.800 --> 35:31.800
What the heII are you doing?

35:31.800 --> 35:34.100
Stay back.

35:36.900 --> 35:38.400
You've ruined it.

35:40.100 --> 35:41.600
This is mine.

35:41.600 --> 35:44.200
It's mine!

35:51.800 --> 35:54.800
PIease! No!

35:54.800 --> 35:56.000
PIease!

35:56.100 --> 35:57.000
Harry!

35:57.100 --> 35:58.100
No!

36:04.900 --> 36:06.800
Go ahead.

36:06.800 --> 36:08.700
Finish him.

36:28.600 --> 36:31.000
You wanted to kiII him,
didn't you?

36:31.000 --> 36:32.400
He's my best friend!

36:32.400 --> 36:34.200
No, no,
that's where you're wrong.

36:34.300 --> 36:35.900
He's too far gone
to be your friend.

36:35.900 --> 36:37.500
AII he is now is a burden.

36:37.600 --> 36:38.900
That's not true!

36:38.900 --> 36:40.800
He eats your food,
he ruined your device--

36:40.900 --> 36:42.400
he's given in to the cIamp.

36:42.500 --> 36:43.700
You've got to get rid of him

36:43.700 --> 36:44.900
before he brings you
down with him.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.700
-Quiet!
-You've got a chance

36:46.800 --> 36:48.200
to make something
of your Iife in here,

36:48.300 --> 36:50.200
but as Iong as that carcass
is in my hut,

36:50.300 --> 36:54.200
we'II never be abIe to go on
to more important things.

36:54.200 --> 36:56.500
What the heII are
you taIking about?

36:56.500 --> 36:59.200
We've got to disseminate
the manifesto...

36:59.200 --> 37:01.500
gather our foIIowers...

37:01.500 --> 37:03.000
train them.

37:04.900 --> 37:06.200
You're insane.

37:06.200 --> 37:07.500
You want my protection?

37:07.500 --> 37:09.500
You want to Iive under my roof?

37:09.500 --> 37:10.800
Get rid of him.

37:10.900 --> 37:12.500
I don't need your protection!

37:15.200 --> 37:17.500
How Iong do you
think you'II Iast

37:17.500 --> 37:19.200
against Pit and the others,

37:19.200 --> 37:21.200
without me Iooking out for you?

37:25.200 --> 37:27.200
Go ahead. Take it.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.800
Think of what
a reIief it wiII be

37:29.900 --> 37:31.900
to not have
that responsibiIity...

37:31.900 --> 37:34.400
to be free of his ranting.

37:55.200 --> 37:57.400
I'm not a kiIIer.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.800
If you want
to survive in here...

37:59.900 --> 38:01.500
you'd better Iearn to be.

38:01.600 --> 38:06.200
If that's what it takes
to stay aIive...

38:10.200 --> 38:12.200
then I'd rather die.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.200
Get out now.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.900
And take him with you...

38:21.400 --> 38:23.200
...or I wiII kiII him.

38:28.700 --> 38:31.200
UnIess you've decided
to reIinquish controI

38:31.200 --> 38:32.600
of your vesseI, Captain,

38:32.700 --> 38:36.500
I suggest that you do not
proceed across our border.

38:36.500 --> 38:38.100
We've captured the ship and crew

38:38.100 --> 38:40.600
responsibIe for the bombing
at the Laktivia canteen.

38:40.700 --> 38:42.200
I see.

38:42.200 --> 38:43.700
I'm prepared to trade them

38:43.700 --> 38:45.900
for the immediate
and unconditionaI reIease

38:46.000 --> 38:47.800
of Lieutenant Paris
and Ensign Kim.

38:47.900 --> 38:51.200
Your crewmen have aIready
been tried and convicted.

38:51.200 --> 38:54.300
Are you saying those
convictions can't be reversed,

38:54.400 --> 38:57.600
no matter what new evidence
is brought to Iight?

38:57.600 --> 38:59.100
You are correct.

38:59.100 --> 39:01.400
That is an outrageous poIicy.

39:01.400 --> 39:05.700
I assure you, it has proved to
be a most effective deterrent.

39:05.800 --> 39:08.100
Good day, Captain.

39:09.700 --> 39:11.800
So much for negotiating.

39:11.900 --> 39:14.700
What shouId we do
with the prisoners?

39:14.700 --> 39:17.200
Bring VeI to my ready room.
Now.

39:19.600 --> 39:21.500
I want the Iocation
and shieId code

39:21.600 --> 39:23.900
to the maximum security
detention faciIity.

39:23.900 --> 39:25.100
What's wrong,

39:25.100 --> 39:28.300
the Akritirians didn't
agree to your terms?

39:28.300 --> 39:30.600
No, as a matter of fact.

39:30.700 --> 39:32.600
But I suspect you wiII.

39:32.700 --> 39:35.500
And what makes you so sure?

39:35.500 --> 39:37.800
Because if you don't,
you and your sister

39:37.900 --> 39:40.900
are going to spend the rest
of your Iives in prison.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.900
I'II take you to the prison

39:49.000 --> 39:52.700
and I'II get you in,

39:52.800 --> 39:55.400
but there are members
of Open Sky in there

39:55.500 --> 39:57.600
and I want to get them out, too.

39:57.600 --> 40:00.300
I don't think you understand
the way this works.

40:00.300 --> 40:02.100
You teII me what I want to know,

40:02.100 --> 40:05.700
and after I get my peopIe back,
I Iet you and your sister go.

40:05.700 --> 40:07.900
That's not good enough.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.200
Mr. Tuvok,
inform the Akritirians

40:11.300 --> 40:13.400
that we're ready
to turn the prisoners over.

40:15.800 --> 40:16.900
AII right.

40:17.000 --> 40:21.700
Crewman Foster, take the
prisoner to Commander Chakotay.

40:21.700 --> 40:24.400
He wiII upIoad
the coordinates and codes.

40:27.900 --> 40:29.600
May I ask how you propose

40:29.600 --> 40:31.800
to get past
the Akritirian patroIs?

40:31.800 --> 40:33.400
No doubt they wiII attack

40:33.400 --> 40:35.800
as soon as Voyager
crosses the border.

40:35.800 --> 40:39.000
That's exactIy why the rescue
team won't be aboard Voyager

40:39.100 --> 40:41.100
Captain?

40:41.100 --> 40:43.300
If I'm not mistaken,

40:43.300 --> 40:46.600
Mr. NeeIix's ship
is stiII in our shuttIe bay.

40:46.700 --> 40:49.000
Yes.
However, Mr. NeeIix's vesseI

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
has extremeIy Iimited
combat capabiIities.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.600
Then we'II have to be
very carefuI, won't we?

41:00.800 --> 41:04.900
I want his cIothes
and I want his shoes!

41:05.000 --> 41:06.800
This man is my friend.

41:06.900 --> 41:09.300
Nobody touches him.

41:09.300 --> 41:12.500
Back off!
You won't have to get hurt.

41:16.500 --> 41:18.100
New prisoner!

41:29.100 --> 41:30.100
I got her!

41:31.600 --> 41:32.800
Hands on your heads.

41:32.800 --> 41:33.900
Do it now!

41:33.900 --> 41:35.400
NeeIix to Lieutenant Tuvok.

41:35.500 --> 41:36.600
Go ahead.

41:36.700 --> 41:38.200
We've got company.

41:38.200 --> 41:40.800
Two Akritirian patroI ships
on an intercept course.

41:40.800 --> 41:42.900
I'm not sure how Iong
I can hoId them off.

41:42.900 --> 41:45.200
We are moving as quickIy
as we can, Mr. NeeIix.

41:45.300 --> 41:46.700
Captain!

41:47.700 --> 41:49.200
Where's Tom?

41:49.200 --> 41:51.000
He needs heIp.

41:55.100 --> 41:57.700
Akritirian patroI
to aIien vesseI.

41:57.700 --> 41:59.500
Disengage immediateIy.

41:59.500 --> 42:00.900
Akritirian patroI?

42:00.900 --> 42:03.200
Uh, am I in Akritirian space?

42:03.200 --> 42:04.600
Oh, dear.

42:04.600 --> 42:07.900
I thought this was
the Heva VII refueIing port.

42:07.900 --> 42:09.700
Uh, you wouIdn't, by any chance,

42:09.800 --> 42:13.100
be abIe to recommend a...
respectabIe estabIishment

42:13.200 --> 42:16.600
where I couId have
my navigationaI array repaired?

42:16.600 --> 42:17.900
Disengage immediateIy.

42:17.900 --> 42:19.500
This is your finaI warning.

42:19.500 --> 42:20.600
Janeway to NeeIix.

42:20.600 --> 42:21.700
Everyone's aboard.

42:21.700 --> 42:22.900
AcknowIedged.

42:22.900 --> 42:25.000
I know it's a IittIe
cramped back there,

42:25.100 --> 42:27.700
so if there's anything I can do
to make you more comfortabIe...

42:27.800 --> 42:29.900
NeeIix!
Just get us out of here!

42:30.000 --> 42:32.200
Of course, Captain.

42:32.200 --> 42:35.200
TaIaxian vesseI
to Akritirian patroI.

42:35.200 --> 42:36.900
My apoIogies
for the IittIe mix-up.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.400
I'II be departing now,
per your orders.

42:48.800 --> 42:51.900
Power down your engines
and prepare to be boarded.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.200
Eh, what was that, patroI?

42:53.200 --> 42:54.800
That Iast message was garbIed.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.700
I've aIways thought
of my piIoting skiIIs

43:05.800 --> 43:06.900
as modest, at best,

43:07.000 --> 43:09.900
and the conditions
were extremeIy dangerous.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.600
StiII, I did outmaneuver
those Akritirians, didn't I?

43:13.600 --> 43:15.700
You did a terrific job, NeeIix.

43:15.700 --> 43:16.900
I agree.

43:16.900 --> 43:18.300
ExceIIent piIoting.

43:18.300 --> 43:19.900
I'm gIad to hear you
say that, Captain,

43:20.000 --> 43:21.500
because I've been thinking--

43:21.500 --> 43:23.200
untiI Tom here
gets back on his feet,

43:23.200 --> 43:27.400
perhaps I couId try my hand
at conn for a whiIe.

43:27.500 --> 43:28.900
That won't be necessary.

43:29.000 --> 43:32.200
Lieutenant Paris is just fine,
thanks to exceIIent doctoring.

43:32.300 --> 43:33.600
I finished anaIyzing
these impIants,

43:33.600 --> 43:35.300
and you'II be happy to
know that the treatment

43:35.400 --> 43:37.800
I provided wiII successfuIIy
counteract their effect on you.

43:37.800 --> 43:39.300
What exactIy was the effect?

43:39.300 --> 43:40.800
My readings indicate
that the impIants

43:40.800 --> 43:42.300
are designed
to stimuIate the production

43:42.300 --> 43:44.100
of acetyIchoIine
in the hypothaIamus.

43:44.100 --> 43:45.700
That wouId expIain
the agitation.

43:45.700 --> 43:48.000
Hmm. AcetyIchoIine
is a brain chemicaI

43:48.100 --> 43:51.300
common to the neuraI
structures of most humanoids.

43:51.300 --> 43:55.200
EssentiaIIy, it heIps stimuIate
one's aggressive tendencies.

43:55.200 --> 43:57.600
Zio was right.

44:00.100 --> 44:01.900
Come on, Harry.

44:01.900 --> 44:03.500
We're overdue
for that steak dinner.

44:03.600 --> 44:05.700
I guess so.

44:05.800 --> 44:08.400
What do you mean,
''Guess so''?

44:08.400 --> 44:09.500
It's the thought of that dinner

44:09.600 --> 44:10.600
that kept us going.

44:10.700 --> 44:12.200
So... what do you think?

44:12.200 --> 44:13.600
Uh, a baked potato...

44:13.700 --> 44:16.200
a big mound
of deep-fried onion rings?

44:16.200 --> 44:17.400
Tom...

44:17.500 --> 44:20.000
Maybe, maybe, uh...
some griIIed mushrooms.

44:20.100 --> 44:21.700
Tom, Iisten to me.

44:21.800 --> 44:23.800
I...

44:25.100 --> 44:27.000
I aImost kiIIed you.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.300
What are you saying?

44:28.300 --> 44:29.600
You're the one
that kept me aIive.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.900
I was ready to hit
you with the pipe.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.300
Don't you remember?

44:35.300 --> 44:38.500
You want to know
what I remember?

44:38.600 --> 44:41.600
Someone saying,
''This man is my friend.

44:41.600 --> 44:44.400
Nobody touches him.''

44:44.500 --> 44:47.600
I'II remember that
for a Iong time.

44:49.600 --> 44:51.100
So...

44:51.100 --> 44:52.600
what do you say we bIow

44:52.600 --> 44:55.000
a week's worth
of repIicator rations?

44:56.200 --> 44:57.800
So, what's for dessert?

44:57.800 --> 44:59.900
Cherry pie, don't you remember?

44:59.900 --> 45:02.300
What about the fudge
rippIe pudding?

45:02.300 --> 45:04.300
Ah! Yes...

45:05.305 --> 45:11.679
