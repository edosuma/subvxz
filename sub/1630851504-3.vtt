know, like speakers

08:55.610 --> 08:56.943

08:57.095 --> 08:58.185

08:58.205 --> 09:01.522

black vinyl...

09:01.616 --> 09:02.932

- Right.

09:03.026 --> 09:04.525
What it would have been
back in the day.

09:04.619 --> 09:06.269
- Are we doing cop car quality,

09:06.362 --> 09:08.121
Or are we doing, like,
show car quality?

09:08.215 --> 09:12.442
- The car is gonna be used
for parades and having fun.

09:12.535 --> 09:14.035
- So it's actually
gonna get used.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.704
It's not gonna be just sitting
in a museum,

09:16.798 --> 09:18.464
Kinda like the firetruck
we did, right?

09:18.559 --> 09:21.560
- Correct, yes, we want it
to be count's kustoms nice,

09:21.787 --> 09:24.545
But we also want it to be
useable and durable.

09:24.565 --> 09:25.972

09:26.124 --> 09:27.473

09:27.568 --> 09:29.309
Which is really cool.

09:29.461 --> 09:31.127
They get to show off a lot of
their history, their heritage.

09:31.146 --> 09:32.645
I love stuff like that.

09:32.798 --> 09:35.407
Supporting our first responders

09:35.634 --> 09:37.725

they can have fun with, man.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.469

- Out in the community.

I think the whole combo's
working.

10:39.881 --> 10:41.714
What I wanted to do was just
kind of stare at it

10:41.867 --> 10:45.368
For a second, and confirm
in my mind the top.

10:45.461 --> 10:46.794
You know, because
of the interior,

10:46.813 --> 10:49.055
Initially I was torn--
no pun intended--

10:49.207 --> 10:51.966
On which direction I was gonna
go with the top.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.543
- Right, the tan or--

10:53.561 --> 10:55.879
- Was I gonna go with, like,
a creamy, you know, tan

10:55.897 --> 10:58.823
On the top, or was I gonna go
with the chocolate on the top,

10:58.975 --> 11:01.401
Which is what I went with,

11:01.553 --> 11:04.329
And now as I'm looking at it,

11:04.480 --> 11:06.498
I'm still leaning
towards the root beer,

11:06.725 --> 11:09.058
And I want to know
what your thoughts are.

11:09.077 --> 11:11.485
You're the artist, so I really
want your opinion,

11:11.505 --> 11:13.654
But I'm still feeling
the chocolate.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.322
- My vote's chocolate.
- Okay.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.566
- Chocolate, chocolate,
chocolate.

11:16.584 --> 11:17.917
You really want my opinion,

11:18.011 --> 11:19.827
It'd be like a chocolate
alligator or something.

11:19.921 --> 11:21.328
- Yeah, well, you know,

11:21.348 --> 11:22.422
I'm supposed to be flipping
this thing, so--

11:22.574 --> 11:23.907
- With the matching boots.
- Right.

11:23.925 --> 11:26.000
Well, I gotta tell you,
this coating on here,

11:26.019 --> 11:29.595
It just, you know, confirms
for me as I look at this

11:29.748 --> 11:31.748
That chocolate's the way to go.

11:31.766 --> 11:34.584
- Yeah, when we pulled
all the material off here,

11:34.602 --> 11:36.361
The roof was in good shape,
so I just put extra coats

11:36.512 --> 11:37.937
Of epoxy on there.

11:38.089 --> 11:39.698
- It's wicked.
- This is a cool-looking car.

11:39.925 --> 11:41.533

a blind squirrel finds a nut,

11:43.595 --> 11:46.095

with lincolns.

11:46.189 --> 11:48.355
I see 'em,
and so this is a flip.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.266
We're gonna make
a way cool car and flip it,

11:50.359 --> 11:51.543

12:01.963 --> 12:04.614
How far away until this thing
is done?

12:04.707 --> 12:05.615
Because, you know,
I have to make

12:05.708 --> 12:07.559
That final, initial decision.

12:07.786 --> 12:08.968
- I'd say a week and a half
tops.

12:09.120 --> 12:12.305

to not look at it

12:12.457 --> 12:13.473

What he would like to do is
pay homage to the '55

16:38.832 --> 16:41.148
On his motorcycle tin.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.392
- Really?
- Yeah, on a bike.

16:43.486 --> 16:45.670
Not copy outright.
- Uh-huh.

16:45.821 --> 16:49.582
- But give this look
on a motorcycle.

16:49.734 --> 16:51.158
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:51.252 --> 16:53.919
When he said that, I said--
I told him that, you know,

16:54.072 --> 16:56.572
I'll talk to danny about it.

16:56.591 --> 17:00.259
We're not real big on copying
or repeating paint jobs.

17:00.353 --> 17:04.522
- And I would say
under normal circumstances,

17:04.673 --> 17:08.026
I would not like that.

17:08.177 --> 17:11.270
I would be bothered by that
under normal circumstances,

17:11.364 --> 17:14.106
But there's something
about this that feels so nice.

17:14.259 --> 17:15.758
- Okay.

17:15.777 --> 17:21.355
- That he's doing this out
of an homage to this,

17:21.374 --> 17:22.932
Out of paying respect to this.

17:22.950 --> 17:26.360
I love that, so I actually
really dig the idea.

into your court for a second.

17:28.956 --> 17:30.364
- Okay.

17:30.383 --> 17:35.369
- When you painted this '55
for me,

17:35.388 --> 17:38.723
I came to you with merely
my thoughts on it.

17:38.874 --> 17:42.285
You went crazy on it, way
over the top and ran with it,

17:42.378 --> 17:45.288
So this is really
your paint job.

17:45.381 --> 17:48.882
So I ask you, are you cool
with it?

17:48.902 --> 17:51.069
- Can't stand in any way,
shape, or form

17:51.220 --> 17:52.295
Repeating anything.

17:52.313 --> 17:53.796
- Got it.
- However...

17:53.815 --> 17:55.314
- Yeah.

17:55.466 --> 17:58.242
- Because there's so much
on this big ass car,

17:58.469 --> 18:01.470
That I can't possibly even
begin to cram

18:01.489 --> 18:03.730
Onto a tiny little gas tank
and some fenders--

18:03.750 --> 18:05.141
- Right.

18:05.234 --> 18:07.827
- I think I can give the client
the look

18:07.979 --> 18:09.995
Without being a carbon copy.

18:10.148 --> 18:11.647
- I agreed with you.

18:11.666 --> 18:13.316
You know, it would be
a whole different story

18:13.334 --> 18:15.318
If he said, "hey, look,
I've got a '55 chevy,

18:15.336 --> 18:16.485
And I want you to do this."

18:16.579 --> 18:18.262
- No way in hell.
- It would be a problem.

18:18.414 --> 18:20.431
- Yeah, that'd be insulting.
- Right.

18:20.583 --> 18:23.768
But on a bike,
it's really respectful,

18:23.919 --> 18:25.328
And I love it.

18:25.346 --> 18:26.846
So as long as you're good
with it, I'm great.

18:26.998 --> 18:28.681
- I'm fine.

18:28.833 --> 18:31.109
- You know, normally, somebody
wanted to straight up copy

18:31.260 --> 18:33.427
One of my paint jobs on one of

18:33.446 --> 18:34.687
That's just a no, man.

finding out who the client is,

That'll give me a chance
to feel it out a little bit.

41:01.518 --> 41:03.609
- Yeah, you can drive it.
- Yeah.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.277
- Tell me what you think.
I'm gonna ride in the back.

41:05.297 --> 41:07.297
- That's right,
it's not a car to drive.

41:07.448 --> 41:09.524
It's a car to be driven in.
- [laughs]

41:09.542 --> 41:11.784
<i> - I'm so proud how this car</i>
<i> came out, man.</i>

41:11.803 --> 41:13.377
<i> I, frankly, I'd keep it</i>
<i> for myself</i>

41:13.530 --> 41:16.047
If I didn't already have
a wicked '78 lincoln,

41:16.141 --> 41:17.699
But I'm happy

41:17.717 --> 41:19.458
That mike nichols is laying
this baby on the floor,

41:19.552 --> 41:21.202
Gonna get some eyes on it.

41:21.221 --> 41:23.554
He's gonna turn this into the
quick flip I was looking for.

41:23.707 --> 41:25.540
- See, this is what
I would want to pull up

41:25.558 --> 41:26.874
To the front of a casino in.

41:26.893 --> 41:28.226
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, no doubt.

41:28.320 --> 41:29.544
- Like robert de niro
getting out of the car.

41:29.562 --> 41:31.212
- Exactly.

41:31.231 --> 41:32.730
Man, I like this.

41:32.882 --> 41:35.474
I could just have mike drive us
around all day back here.

41:35.494 --> 41:36.993
- Where you wanna go?
- This is nice, man.

41:37.144 --> 41:38.386
I don't know.

41:38.479 --> 41:40.163
Where are we allowed to go?

41:40.390 --> 41:42.390
- I think we just used
ten gallons now.

41:42.483 --> 41:43.983
- Right.
- Around the corner.

41:44.002 --> 41:45.576
- Right, right, I'm surprised
we haven't had to stop

41:45.670 --> 41:46.577
For gas twice.

41:46.671 --> 41:47.837
[laughter]
