00:24.594 --> 00:26.327

Ariadne's chambers.

00:26.361 --> 00:28.194
It is the blood
of the intruder.

00:31.261 --> 00:32.861

This is all my doing.

01:55.767 --> 01:58.501
-Where are you going?
-To hand myself in.

01:58.534 --> 02:00.574
If I confess that it was me
that tried to kill the Queen,

02:00.607 --> 02:02.274
then perhaps she will spare
Ariadne's life.

02:02.307 --> 02:05.107
Ariadne is all
that stands between
the Queen and the throne.

02:05.141 --> 02:07.207
Pasiphae will
never spare her life.

02:07.241 --> 02:10.074
She will execute
you alongside Ariadne.

02:10.107 --> 02:13.507
Well, then, so be it.
I won't let her die alone.

02:13.541 --> 02:16.940
Because being slowly cooked
to death together is so
much more preferable.

02:16.974 --> 02:19.274
I'm not going to
let Ariadne think
that I abandoned her.

02:19.307 --> 02:21.374
You think you'll
have a hero's death?

02:21.407 --> 02:24.074
You will achieve nothing
and die a fool.

02:24.107 --> 02:25.874
We have been
through too much together,

02:25.907 --> 02:28.207

of you to let you throw
your life away.

02:28.241 --> 02:29.907
I will not let that happen.

17:52.661 --> 17:54.561
PYTHAGORAS: Are we headed
in any particular direction,

17:54.594 --> 17:56.861
or are we just fleeing
in a general direction?

17:57.861 --> 18:00.361
We're heading to
the mines of Pangeon.

18:00.394 --> 18:03.261
The Oracle said they wouldn't
think to look for us
amongst the dead.

18:03.294 --> 18:05.267
-PYTHAGORAS: The dead?
-What did she mean?

18:06.001 --> 18:07.701
I don't know.

18:07.734 --> 18:09.501
She just said we
were to go there.

18:09.534 --> 18:11.034
That's the problem
with these Oracles,

18:11.067 --> 18:13.167
they only ever tell
you half the story.

18:33.001 --> 18:35.234
I found this among the
embers of the fire.

18:38.934 --> 18:41.134
Ariadne looked so beautiful
in this dress.

18:45.001 --> 18:46.501
Such a shame.

18:48.067 --> 18:50.567
The scouts found
some tracks leading west.

18:50.601 --> 18:52.767
I want them captured
before sundown.

19:27.107 --> 19:28.507
(GROANS)

19:37.907 --> 19:39.174
(DOOR CLOSES)

19:48.107 --> 19:50.674
MELAS: <i>It is as you feared.</i>
<i>The King is being poisoned.</i>

19:50.707 --> 19:53.307
We must do all we
can to save him.

19:53.341 --> 19:55.774
You always said
that he had no right
to be on the throne.

19:55.807 --> 19:57.941
But if Pasiphae
were to seize power?

19:59.041 --> 20:01.941
The suffering
she would cause...

20:01.974 --> 20:03.881
It cannot be
allowed to happen.

20:04.547 --> 20:06.714
It is the lesser of two evils.

20:09.347 --> 20:11.447
Something's troubling you.

20:14.847 --> 20:18.914
Are you certain
it was wise to send
Jason to the silver mines?

20:19.647 --> 20:22.414
He will be safe there.

20:22.447 --> 20:25.481
Who better to protect him
than his own father?

20:29.514 --> 20:31.314
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

20:31.347 --> 20:32.981
Any other ideas?

20:33.014 --> 20:34.914
Don't even think about saying
we could grow beards.

20:34.947 --> 20:37.314
I wasn't going to.
Imagine you with a beard.

20:37.347 --> 20:38.781
Ridiculous idea.

20:55.247 --> 20:56.614
What is it?

20:56.647 --> 20:58.047
I thought I saw something.

21:01.181 --> 21:02.521
Perhaps it was nothing.

21:07.821 --> 21:08.887
(CRUMBLING)

21:44.154 --> 21:46.821
Please. We did not
mean to startle you.

21:48.987 --> 21:50.487
We mean you no harm.

21:52.521 --> 21:53.854
What are you doing here?

21:54.621 --> 21:56.254
This is our home.

21:56.287 --> 21:58.654
ARIADNE:
You live here in the caves?

21:58.687 --> 22:00.987
We are shunned
because of our disease.

22:01.021 --> 22:02.887
PYTHAGORAS: The Oracle.

22:02.921 --> 22:04.927
She was referring
to the living dead.

22:06.027 --> 22:07.394
They are lepers.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.894
What brings you here?

22:11.794 --> 22:15.027
I was told to come here
by the Oracle in
the Temple of Poseidon.

22:16.294 --> 22:18.594
She told me it would be safe.

22:18.627 --> 22:19.794
Safe from whom?

22:22.727 --> 22:24.561
From Pasiphae.

22:24.594 --> 22:26.794
The Queen would
see us all executed.

22:41.361 --> 22:43.027
What is your name?

22:43.994 --> 22:45.061
It's Jason.

22:47.394 --> 22:49.061
Will you help us?

22:54.361 --> 22:55.761
Our home is yours.

23:01.727 --> 23:03.361
HERCULES:
I imagined us hiding out
somewhere sunny,

23:03.394 --> 23:07.534
spending the days
drinking wine in the shade
of an olive grove.

23:07.567 --> 23:09.567
Instead we are to
hide out in a cold,

23:09.601 --> 23:11.934
dark cave with
a bunch of lepers.

23:14.067 --> 23:15.501
Thank you.

23:17.734 --> 23:18.801
(SNIFFS)

23:19.067 --> 23:20.334
Ooh...

23:22.067 --> 23:24.401
Mmm. (LAUGHS)

23:29.934 --> 23:32.301
She is the Princess Ariadne?

23:32.334 --> 23:34.934
She was to be put to death
in the brazen bull.

23:36.101 --> 23:38.567
Well, surely Minos would never
allow such a thing?

23:39.367 --> 23:41.201
The King is on his death bed.

23:41.234 --> 23:43.301
He is powerless.

23:43.334 --> 23:46.601
And now there is nothing that
stands between Pasiphae
and the throne.

23:49.367 --> 23:52.034
Such desire for power.

23:52.067 --> 23:54.001
It is truly a dangerous thing.

23:59.667 --> 24:01.867
How long have you
had your disease?

24:05.841 --> 24:07.574
It's many years now.

24:10.741 --> 24:13.207
I have almost forgotten
what life was like before it.

24:15.307 --> 24:16.507
I am sorry.

24:17.974 --> 24:21.041
There was a time
when I pitied myself...

24:21.074 --> 24:25.274
But I have found better,
more loyal friends
among these people...

24:27.307 --> 24:29.541
Than I ever had in
the outside world.

24:37.074 --> 24:38.841
She is very beautiful.

24:41.807 --> 24:43.307
You have feelings for her?

24:46.074 --> 24:47.374
Yeah.

24:47.407 --> 24:49.541
More than I can express.

24:53.374 --> 24:56.307
A little bit more. Thank you.

24:58.807 --> 25:00.707
Lovely people these lepers.

25:00.741 --> 25:02.541
Good cooks too.
Have you tried the stew?

25:02.574 --> 25:04.981
You know,
I have never known a man
whose heart and head

25:05.014 --> 25:07.715
is so ruled by his stomach.

25:22.842 --> 25:24.809
I'm sorry.
I didn't see you there.

25:24.842 --> 25:27.642
I have come to
pray with the King.
You may leave us.

25:27.675 --> 25:31.709
The Queen
instructed me to attend
to the King at all times.

25:31.742 --> 25:35.042
No one but a priest may
tend to the King at this time.

25:35.075 --> 25:39.375
The royal death rites
are a sacred ritual,
as Poseidon demands.

25:39.409 --> 25:41.109
Would you dare defy the gods?

26:10.382 --> 26:13.215
HEPTARIAN:
They have taken shelter
in the old silver mines.

26:13.249 --> 26:15.015
The tracks lead
right to the entrance.

26:15.049 --> 26:16.082
PASIPHAE: Flush them out.

26:16.782 --> 26:19.449
I want Ariadne taken alive.

26:19.482 --> 26:22.549
We shall execute her
in front of her people.

26:22.582 --> 26:25.482
It will serve as a lesson
to those who would defy me.

26:25.515 --> 26:26.915
And those who
helped her escape?

26:29.615 --> 26:31.582
Kill them where they stand.

26:34.282 --> 26:35.449
HEPTARIAN: Men!

26:50.449 --> 26:52.182
-They have found you.
-What's happening?

26:52.215 --> 26:54.115
TYCHON: Soldiers are advancing
on the entrance to the mines.

26:54.149 --> 26:56.915
I said we shouldn't have
come here. We are trapped
like rats in a barrel.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.982
Not quite.
There is a different way out.

26:59.015 --> 27:00.649
It leads to the other
side of the mountains.

27:00.682 --> 27:02.182
The others will stay here
and delay the soldiers

27:02.215 --> 27:03.549
as long as they can. Come.

27:04.782 --> 27:06.955
What did I tell you?
Wonderful people.

27:07.789 --> 27:08.922
Thank you.

27:18.389 --> 27:19.689
(COUGHING)

27:25.089 --> 27:26.522
After them!

27:35.922 --> 27:37.022
(COUGHING)

27:40.655 --> 27:42.022
(GROANS)

27:46.122 --> 27:48.455
-You must continue alone.
-What about you?

27:48.489 --> 27:50.355
I must help my people.

27:50.389 --> 27:51.722
Head north through the forest.

27:51.755 --> 27:54.355
You will come to
a small stream.

27:54.389 --> 27:55.955
I will meet you there.

27:56.822 --> 27:57.889
Thank you.

28:13.171 --> 28:14.204
Jason!

28:15.171 --> 28:16.571
No one knows
the caves like they do.

28:16.604 --> 28:19.137
-Tychon will
join us soon enough.
-(HORSE WHINNYING)

28:20.771 --> 28:22.104
Make for the trees!

28:28.037 --> 28:30.037
Where are the others?

28:30.071 --> 28:32.171
I thought they were behind us.

28:32.571 --> 28:33.604
Come on.

28:36.104 --> 28:38.537
Jason? Hercules?

28:46.671 --> 28:47.771
(GASPS)

28:49.004 --> 28:51.337
-Shh! Shh!
-(MUFFLED GROANS)

28:57.104 --> 28:58.604
You scared the life out of me.

28:58.637 --> 29:01.604
Oh, "Thank you, Hercules,
for saving my life yet again!"

29:01.637 --> 29:04.304
I fear you will take my life
if you do not get off me.

29:04.337 --> 29:05.544
(GROANS)

29:18.011 --> 29:19.277
There. Take them down.

29:24.077 --> 29:25.344
(WHINNYING)

29:32.844 --> 29:34.344
JASON: I'll hold them off.

29:34.377 --> 29:35.877
-Head north and
I'll catch up with you.
-I'm not leaving you.

29:35.911 --> 29:38.177
It's our only chance.
You have to run.

29:38.211 --> 29:39.311
Run!

29:48.311 --> 29:49.444
(GRUNTS)

30:06.517 --> 30:07.784
(GASPS)

30:07.817 --> 30:09.117
Help me. I'm hurt.

30:14.484 --> 30:15.584
(GRUNTS)

30:26.251 --> 30:29.417
No! No! Jason!

30:35.051 --> 30:36.884
ARIADNE: (VOICE ECHOING)
No! No!

30:47.351 --> 30:49.417
Ensure Ariadne
is left unharmed.

30:49.451 --> 30:51.551
She'll be returning
to Atlantis with us.

30:54.984 --> 30:56.851
I'll see to this one myself.

30:56.884 --> 30:58.084
Go.

31:09.957 --> 31:10.991
TYCHON: No!

31:11.024 --> 31:12.924
This does not concern you.

31:12.957 --> 31:14.224
This concerns us both.

31:14.891 --> 31:16.557
You do not recognise me,

31:18.257 --> 31:20.457
yet it was you who
made me like this.

31:25.391 --> 31:26.491
Aeson?

31:28.257 --> 31:30.091
You have Princess Ariadne.
You have what you came for.

31:30.124 --> 31:31.991
Now leave the boy and go.

31:32.024 --> 31:33.991
Well, who is he to you?

31:42.191 --> 31:43.357
He is our son.

31:55.457 --> 31:57.491
He is touched by the gods,
as you are.

31:59.724 --> 32:01.191
He is your blood.

32:08.531 --> 32:11.097
But I believed him to be dead.

32:11.131 --> 32:13.897
When you
betrayed me and usurped
the throne with Minos,

32:13.931 --> 32:15.931
I took him somewhere
he would be safe,

32:15.964 --> 32:18.297
where you would
never find him.

32:34.664 --> 32:36.064
Does he know who he is?

32:39.764 --> 32:41.497
Does he know I am his mother?

32:44.997 --> 32:45.997
No.

32:48.431 --> 32:50.164
Why did you not tell him?

32:56.231 --> 33:02.397
I will not see him corrupted
by this endless quest
for power.

33:02.431 --> 33:06.104
To live a life where he cannot
even trust his own wife.

33:06.137 --> 33:08.937
I do not want to see him die
fighting for the throne.

33:08.971 --> 33:11.071
And what if he
feels differently?

33:12.771 --> 33:15.471
If he doesn't know
who he is, then he will
never challenge you.

33:17.204 --> 33:19.937
I do not believe
you can kill your own son.

33:29.004 --> 33:33.804
Give me your word
that he will
never know the truth.

33:37.704 --> 33:38.937
You have my word.

33:41.937 --> 33:44.737
It seems we can finally
agree on something.

33:54.871 --> 33:56.237
Jason.

33:56.271 --> 33:57.804
Jason, Jason. Come.

33:57.837 --> 33:59.237
We must leave here.

34:03.404 --> 34:04.737
Come.

34:04.771 --> 34:06.011
Come on.

34:17.478 --> 34:18.545
Jason!

34:22.545 --> 34:24.312
(PANTING) Help me.

34:52.145 --> 34:53.312
Where's Ariadne?

34:57.245 --> 34:59.812
They have taken her.
There is nothing
you could have done.

34:59.845 --> 35:02.445
-No. We have to go after them.
-You're too weak.
It is madness.

35:02.478 --> 35:03.978
No. I have to try.

35:04.012 --> 35:08.085
You are of no use to Ariadne
if you cannot hold a sword.

35:08.118 --> 35:10.585
We will gather some herbs
to pack your wounds.

35:17.785 --> 35:19.085
Rest.

35:31.218 --> 35:33.118
You should not
return to Atlantis.

35:36.918 --> 35:38.818
You will be too
late to save Ariadne.

35:38.852 --> 35:40.118
I have to try.

35:42.018 --> 35:43.285
It doesn't have
to be this way.

35:43.318 --> 35:46.018
You can choose a different
life for yourself.

35:46.052 --> 35:49.818
I would have no life at all
if Ariadne were to die

35:49.852 --> 35:52.018
and I did nothing
to try and save her.

35:56.318 --> 35:59.052
There was a time
when I was like you.

35:59.585 --> 36:00.618
Jason!

36:01.285 --> 36:02.352
(GRUNTING)

36:41.258 --> 36:42.392
(GASPING)

36:46.192 --> 36:47.358
You...

36:47.392 --> 36:48.425
(GROANS)

37:14.998 --> 37:16.498
This is as far as I go.

37:17.865 --> 37:19.031
Keep heading east.

37:19.065 --> 37:20.898
You should reach
Atlantis by sundown.

37:23.531 --> 37:25.298
Thank you for
everything you have done.

37:27.798 --> 37:29.232
Perhaps we'll
meet again one day.

37:31.265 --> 37:32.498
I hope so.

37:37.598 --> 37:38.865
(SIGHS)

37:44.298 --> 37:46.565
You should be proud of the man
you have become.

37:55.832 --> 37:57.232
Lovely fellows.

38:02.898 --> 38:04.565
Take her to the cells.

38:06.598 --> 38:07.772
Father...

38:08.538 --> 38:09.672
Father?

38:09.705 --> 38:11.072
Minos?

38:11.105 --> 38:13.572
You would
execute my daughter as
I lie on my deathbed?

38:13.605 --> 38:16.372
No, no. Ariadne has been
found guilty of treason.

38:16.405 --> 38:18.872
She has been
tried in accordance
with our laws.

38:18.905 --> 38:20.205
You must know I
would never betray you.

38:20.238 --> 38:21.938
She has conspired
against me...

38:21.972 --> 38:26.738
Whatever Ariadne has done,
I do not believe her
capable of treason.

38:26.772 --> 38:27.872
You are mistaken.

38:27.905 --> 38:29.338
Your sickness has
clouded your judgement.

38:29.372 --> 38:30.538
Enough!

38:30.572 --> 38:34.938
You do not
question my judgement!

38:34.972 --> 38:37.072
We will discuss this later.

38:38.972 --> 38:40.505
Release my daughter at once.

38:43.438 --> 38:45.805
You dare to defy your King?

38:51.405 --> 38:52.838
(MUFFLED SOBBING)

39:02.605 --> 39:04.872
They'll be holding
Ariadne in the palace.

39:04.905 --> 39:07.378
You realise attempting to
rescue her is suicide?

39:08.512 --> 39:09.878
I'm just saying...

39:10.345 --> 39:11.745
I have to try.

39:13.378 --> 39:14.478
Melas?

39:16.378 --> 39:18.412
I bring word from
Princess Ariadne.

39:23.512 --> 39:24.912
What is it?

39:45.212 --> 39:48.045
It seems I have
much to thank you for.

39:49.945 --> 39:52.245
My daughter tells me
that she owes you her life.

39:53.245 --> 39:55.578
She owes me nothing.

39:55.612 --> 39:59.378
You showed great courage.
There is a debt to be paid.

39:59.412 --> 40:00.712
JASON: I don't seek a reward.

40:00.745 --> 40:04.145
Just knowing that she is safe
and unharmed is enough.

40:08.085 --> 40:12.318
Whatever feelings
you may have for her,
you must forget them.

40:13.785 --> 40:16.118
Ariadne is of royal blood.

40:17.252 --> 40:20.185
Nothing can ever
happen between you.

40:44.052 --> 40:45.985
PASIPHAE: You knew
all along, didn't you?

40:49.185 --> 40:50.985
You knew he was my son.

40:53.052 --> 40:54.685
You did not think to tell me?

40:55.885 --> 40:59.252
All that I have done,
I have done to protect him.

41:00.018 --> 41:01.685
What do you see for him?

41:03.518 --> 41:05.552
What of his future?

41:05.585 --> 41:08.592
What is to become of him?
Tell me.

41:09.825 --> 41:13.258
It is your own future
that should concern you.

41:16.692 --> 41:18.225
What do you see?

41:19.592 --> 41:21.858
Your paths are as one.

41:24.292 --> 41:26.692
The day will come

41:26.725 --> 41:28.958
when Jason will destroy you.

41:44.258 --> 41:46.458
PYTHAGORAS: What do
you mean he offered you
a purse of gold?

41:46.492 --> 41:47.592
Oh. For saving Ariadne.

41:47.625 --> 41:50.458
And you turned it down?
You know what you are?

41:50.492 --> 41:53.092
You're an idiot.
I don't know why
I bother with you.

41:53.125 --> 41:55.692
It's because you like me.
You admitted it.

41:55.725 --> 41:58.625
A moment of weakness.
Just be grateful for it.

41:58.658 --> 41:59.925
Grateful?

41:59.958 --> 42:01.758
What makes you
think I like you?

42:01.792 --> 42:03.858
Everyone likes me.
What's not to like?

42:03.892 --> 42:07.765
Well, the lying, the stealing,
the drinking, the gambling...

42:07.798 --> 42:09.098
-The farting.
-All right.

42:09.132 --> 42:10.698
Apart from the lying,
the stealing, the drinking,

42:10.732 --> 42:12.898
the gambling and the farting,
what's not to like?

42:15.265 --> 42:16.732
Nothing.

42:16.765 --> 42:20.132
You see. You're finally
starting to understand.

42:20.165 --> 42:22.974
This is why I'm a legend
among my people.

42:23.007 --> 42:27.041
Did I tell you
about when I wrestled
the Nemean lion?

42:27.074 --> 42:29.107
Now there's a story...
