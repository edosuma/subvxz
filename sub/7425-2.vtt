00:00.398 --> 00:02.519
<i>Previously on</i>
Beauty & the Beast:

00:02.520 --> 00:04.949
Catherine, you know, all those
years that I was watching

00:04.950 --> 00:07.785
<i>over you, all I ever wanted</i>
<i>was to meet you.</i>

00:07.819 --> 00:09.920
Vincent, you're not a monster.

00:09.954 --> 00:11.221
<i>You saved my life.</i>

00:15.226 --> 00:16.860
Vincent!

00:16.895 --> 00:20.197
Don't shoot.
She's my daughter.

00:24.934 --> 00:27.269
Maybe it's time
we shut Muirfield down.

00:27.304 --> 00:30.306
Shut Muirfield down?
I <i>am</i> Muirfield.

00:30.340 --> 00:32.475
We got to get Vincent
to go after him again.

00:32.509 --> 00:35.644
<i>Otherwise, Zhao's gonna slither</i>
<i>away for good.</i>

00:35.678 --> 00:38.180
I never stopped looking for you.

00:38.215 --> 00:40.448
Who are you?

00:40.483 --> 00:42.183
<i>He didn't even</i>
<i>recognize you, Cat.</i>

00:42.218 --> 00:44.452
Catherine, I know I haven't
earned your trust back yet,

00:44.487 --> 00:47.623
but the only way I can truly
make amends is to keep trying.

00:47.657 --> 00:49.524
We don't need your help.

00:51.560 --> 00:52.995
Hello.

00:53.029 --> 00:55.229
Cat, it's Tess. Where's Vincent?

00:55.263 --> 00:57.131
I think
you better get down here.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:06.141 --> 01:11.310
We've identified the victim
as Li Zhao, 40 years old,

01:11.345 --> 01:13.446
apparently here in
Manhattan on business.

01:13.480 --> 01:15.515
Our department doesn't have any
leads at this time,

01:15.549 --> 01:18.852
and we welcome the public
to call in with any tips.

01:18.886 --> 01:21.287
It is terrifying
how a good liar Gabe is.

01:21.321 --> 01:24.257
At least he's not
saying who did it.

01:24.291 --> 01:26.225
Maybe Vincent didn't do it.
Maybe...

01:26.260 --> 01:31.063
Maybe a pack of rabid dogs tore
apart the head of Muirfield

01:31.097 --> 01:33.198
20 minutes after Vincent snuck out
of your apartment

01:33.232 --> 01:35.067
while you were blissfully
sleeping?

01:35.101 --> 01:36.601
I just thought
that I had him back.

01:36.636 --> 01:39.571
Now the entire city is looking
for him, and I have no way

01:39.605 --> 01:42.474
to reach him; It's not like
I have a phone number or an e-mail.

01:42.508 --> 01:44.508
Welcome to the black hole
of New York City dating.

01:44.543 --> 01:47.545
I'm serious. What if
the wrong person approaches him

01:47.579 --> 01:50.715
and he loses control, and he could
end up being a caged lab rat.

01:50.749 --> 01:52.750
All right, the truth is,
no one but Gabe knows

01:52.785 --> 01:54.152
who they're looking for.

01:54.186 --> 01:55.987
Yeah, and God knows what
he wants to do with him.

01:56.021 --> 01:57.655
Well, what do you want

01:57.690 --> 01:59.022
to do with him?

01:59.057 --> 02:02.159
I just, I want to spend time
with him,

02:02.193 --> 02:05.428
help him get his memory back,
remind him who he is.

02:05.462 --> 02:06.863
You ladies planning on

02:06.898 --> 02:08.198
coming to work today, or...?

02:08.232 --> 02:09.399
Nice press conference.

02:09.433 --> 02:11.001
I can handle the media,

02:11.035 --> 02:13.570
but I can't man every city
surveillance camera by myself

02:13.604 --> 02:14.737
in the hopes of finding...

02:14.771 --> 02:16.005
My boyfriend?

02:16.039 --> 02:17.506
We need to work together,

02:17.540 --> 02:19.008
pull in JT, do whatever it takes

02:19.042 --> 02:21.110
to find Vincent
before he hurts anyone else.

02:21.144 --> 02:24.046
You make it sound like he's some
out-of-control killer.

02:24.081 --> 02:26.115
This was revenge,
plain and simple.

02:26.149 --> 02:28.184
Muirfield had Vincent
for three months.

02:28.218 --> 02:30.052
They changed him.
He is clearly

02:30.087 --> 02:31.252
more dangerous
than before.

02:31.286 --> 02:33.054
Look at the brutality
of this mauling.

02:33.089 --> 02:35.590
And he did it
with a different M.O.

02:35.624 --> 02:37.625
What?

02:37.659 --> 02:40.095
It's just, Vincent used
to only attack

02:40.129 --> 02:41.930
when it was to intervene
or save someone.

02:41.964 --> 02:44.365
This looks premeditated.

02:44.399 --> 02:46.734
This could be just
the beginning.

02:46.768 --> 02:49.203
We need to hold and assess
him until we know more.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.971
In like, what,
a cage or a cell?

02:51.005 --> 02:53.207
I'm not looking
to prosecute this crime.

02:53.241 --> 02:55.743
I told you, I took this job
to protect Vincent,

02:55.777 --> 02:57.845
that also means
protecting him from himself.

02:57.879 --> 02:59.613
And maybe it is

02:59.647 --> 03:02.982
not the best idea for you to be
alone with him right now.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.450
Wait, you know where he is?

03:04.484 --> 03:05.317
No.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.153
No, she was just saying that

03:07.187 --> 03:10.223
if she could spend time with
him, she would like to do that.

03:10.257 --> 03:12.625
I saw him last night.
We connected.

03:12.659 --> 03:14.060
And then he went
and killed someone.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.728
The Darth Vader of Muirfield!

03:15.763 --> 03:17.263
I just need
a little time

03:17.297 --> 03:19.064
alone with him
to undo what Muirfield did.

03:19.098 --> 03:20.932
No way.
He is too dangerous.

03:20.967 --> 03:23.168
Vincent would never hurt me.

03:23.202 --> 03:26.838
Cat, you said yourself,
he doesn't remember you.

03:29.675 --> 03:31.342
We need to find Vincent
before Gabe and Tess do.

03:31.377 --> 03:32.477
Bring out your laptop.

03:32.511 --> 03:33.745
Can we first take a moment

03:33.780 --> 03:35.345
to celebrate the
small victories?

03:35.380 --> 03:39.016
After ten years of living
in constant fear of extermination...

03:39.050 --> 03:40.151
Yay!

03:40.185 --> 03:42.787
Muirfield's gone.

03:42.821 --> 03:44.822
Okay, can you pull up
the security cameras

03:44.856 --> 03:46.857
you hacked into?
Start with the ones

03:46.892 --> 03:49.093
around Central Park and 75th,
the crime scene.

03:49.127 --> 03:50.694
Whenever we're trying
to catch a perp,

03:50.728 --> 03:52.262
we retrace their steps
for clues.

03:52.296 --> 03:54.831
"Perp"? Is that what Gabe's
calling him?

03:54.865 --> 03:57.533
He says that he's going
to "hold and assess him."

03:57.567 --> 03:59.269
What's that mean?

03:59.303 --> 04:01.537
Who knows? Cart him off
to the <i>New York Times?</i>

04:01.571 --> 04:03.773
Last time Gabe was with
Vincent, he tried to kill him.

04:03.808 --> 04:05.809
What Vincent needs is
to get his memory back,

04:05.843 --> 04:08.643
but it seems like you
and I listing off a bunch of facts

04:08.678 --> 04:11.046
didn't jog anything,
so I was thinking

04:11.080 --> 04:13.282
maybe if he actually experienced
something

04:13.316 --> 04:15.851
that he used to do,
it would trigger...

04:15.885 --> 04:18.053
Did you just take one of those?

04:18.087 --> 04:20.789
Didn't you two just take on
Muirfield together?

04:20.824 --> 04:23.825
That's something he used
to experience, and nothing.

04:23.859 --> 04:25.860
Yeah, but maybe that didn't
work because it taps into

04:25.894 --> 04:27.995
the super soldier side
of him, not the human side.

04:28.030 --> 04:32.066
I was thinking something
more personal, romantic.

04:32.100 --> 04:34.168
You want to take him on a date.

04:34.203 --> 04:37.305
It's sort of like seducing
an ex. You know,

04:37.339 --> 04:40.907
reminding them why they
fell in love with you in the first place.

04:40.942 --> 04:43.543
Except in this case,
reminding him who he used to be.

04:43.577 --> 04:47.080
Totally, undo three months
of billion-dollar black-ops

04:47.114 --> 04:48.982
programming
with a nice dinner.

04:49.016 --> 04:50.984
Let me pull up Open Table.

04:51.018 --> 04:52.418
I'm not talking about going
to a restaurant.

04:52.453 --> 04:53.920
We never went
to restaurants.

04:53.955 --> 04:55.855
I'm talking about something
that we used to do.

04:58.091 --> 04:59.758
You're gonna have sex with him?

04:59.792 --> 05:01.861
I was thinking about dinner
on my roof.

05:01.895 --> 05:03.662
That was our place.

05:03.696 --> 05:05.164
We have a million memories
there.

05:05.198 --> 05:07.766
Vincent even made me
a picnic there,

05:07.800 --> 05:09.568
so I was gonna get him
his favorite sandwich...

05:09.602 --> 05:11.135
Don't we need to find him first?

05:11.170 --> 05:13.171
We will, but given
the situation,

05:13.205 --> 05:14.739
I can't just invite
him to my roof,

05:14.773 --> 05:16.640
and then leave him there
while I go to the market.

05:16.675 --> 05:18.776
Fine.

05:18.810 --> 05:20.945
So, I'm gonna go
retrace his steps.

05:20.980 --> 05:22.747
See if he left any clues
to where he might be.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.682
Stick this in
with the sandwiches.

05:24.716 --> 05:26.050
In case he tries to bolt.

05:26.085 --> 05:27.918
'Cause I can't
keep looking

05:27.952 --> 05:29.353
at surveillance
footage forever.

What the hell
are you talking about?

06:28.109 --> 06:30.510
He's not at the safe house,
and he's not set to execute

06:30.545 --> 06:31.778
his next assignment
till 2100.

06:31.813 --> 06:33.513
Could he be
with my daughter?

06:33.548 --> 06:35.081
We don't believe so.

06:35.115 --> 06:36.650
Does he have
all necessary documentation?

06:36.684 --> 06:38.084
He does.

06:38.118 --> 06:39.619
Okay, then,
he's probably preparing.

06:39.654 --> 06:42.923
Look, he just took care
of Zhao for us.

06:42.957 --> 06:44.991
There's no reason
to doubt his programming now.

06:45.025 --> 06:47.660
Keep me posted.
Got it.

07:04.477 --> 07:06.077
Hey.

07:09.047 --> 07:11.515
Vincent.

07:11.549 --> 07:14.618
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

07:14.652 --> 07:16.920
I know.

07:28.873 --> 07:33.151
So, you being here, does this
mean you remember all of this?

07:33.906 --> 07:36.774
I saw you come up.

07:36.809 --> 07:39.377
Right, of course.

07:39.411 --> 07:43.814
Um, it's not like I expected
it to all come back overnight.

07:43.848 --> 07:45.749
So, why have you been looking
for me?

07:45.783 --> 07:48.919
Well, I wanted to see you again.

07:48.953 --> 07:51.254
And after you left
last night,

07:51.288 --> 07:53.223
I realized I have
no way to reach you.

07:53.257 --> 07:54.224
You were tracking me.

07:54.258 --> 07:59.094
I, I wanted to bring you
up here for, um...

08:01.097 --> 08:02.297
...for a picnic.

08:03.634 --> 08:05.100
I didn't expect you

08:05.135 --> 08:07.469
to just show up,
so I thought that I would

08:07.504 --> 08:09.405
set it up in case I found you,

08:09.439 --> 08:12.808
hence the, uh,
"tracking you."

08:12.843 --> 08:15.376
So, a picnic?

08:15.411 --> 08:18.146
Yeah, I know.
I know it seems crazy,

08:18.180 --> 08:21.650
but it is something
we used to do up here.

08:21.684 --> 08:23.518
And I thought that
if we did it again,

08:23.553 --> 08:24.793
it might trigger some memories.

08:26.388 --> 08:30.357
Or if not, I got you
your favorite sandwich.

08:30.391 --> 08:32.292
I don't know
if that's such a good idea.

08:32.326 --> 08:34.494
What, the sandwich
or the triggering memories?

08:34.529 --> 08:39.499
Because everything that
happened up here is good.

08:45.540 --> 08:48.307
Uh, but we don't have
to eat, we can just talk.

08:48.341 --> 08:50.643
Or if you have somewhere
better to be...

08:50.678 --> 08:52.178
No, not at the moment.

08:52.212 --> 08:54.581
But you do have
somewhere to be?

08:54.615 --> 08:59.652
And you're wearing new clothes
and you're showered.

08:59.687 --> 09:02.287
Did I not shower before?

09:02.321 --> 09:03.722
No, no, you did.

09:03.756 --> 09:08.293
Um, just, where did you
shower this time?

09:08.327 --> 09:11.063
I can't...

09:11.097 --> 09:13.065
Okay, okay.

09:13.099 --> 09:14.900
Can we talk about last night?

09:14.934 --> 09:18.736
It's just, I woke up
and you were gone.

09:18.770 --> 09:19.904
I couldn't sleep.

09:19.938 --> 09:21.572
And Zhao?
I knew it.

09:21.607 --> 09:23.540
I get why, I get
why you did it.

09:23.575 --> 09:26.644
Just, I thought we agreed
that there was another way.

09:26.678 --> 09:28.312
So that's why
you're following me.

09:28.346 --> 09:31.448
No, I don't want to arrest you,
I want to protect you.

09:31.483 --> 09:33.250
Whatever Muirfield did to you,
I want to help undo.

09:33.284 --> 09:34.517
I need to go.

09:34.551 --> 09:37.053
Vincent. Vincent,
please don't.

09:37.088 --> 09:38.488
Vincent!

09:41.025 --> 09:43.159
Why didn't you tranq him?

09:43.193 --> 09:45.394
I didn't have it on me,
I thought he was blowing me off.

09:45.429 --> 09:47.396
You should never go anywhere
without the tranq.

09:47.431 --> 09:49.765
Can you not criticize me?
He just jumped off

09:49.799 --> 09:52.534
the south side of my building
onto Bleeker Street.

09:52.568 --> 09:55.504
It's the precinct, they think
you and I are working with them.

09:55.538 --> 09:58.507
There's a security camera
at Bright Side Laundry.

09:58.541 --> 09:59.608
Start hacking there.

09:59.643 --> 10:01.243
Hey, still nothing.

10:01.277 --> 10:03.545
He just turned right
onto MacDougal.

10:03.579 --> 10:05.047
What?

10:05.081 --> 10:06.447
He's getting in a cab.

10:06.481 --> 10:07.849
Okay, how do you...?

10:07.883 --> 10:09.550
Know he was at
your apartment?

10:09.584 --> 10:11.152
You said you two connected.
We figured

10:11.186 --> 10:12.687
he'd show up sooner or later.

10:12.721 --> 10:14.188
Wait, you've been surveilling
my apartment?

10:14.222 --> 10:16.190
Well, not the inside,
just the perimeter.

10:16.224 --> 10:18.126
I left you a message explaining.

10:18.160 --> 10:21.562
The cab's medallion
number is 2-7-B-3.

10:21.596 --> 10:24.398
2-7-B-3. Okay, hang on.
I've got JT on the other line.

10:24.432 --> 10:26.267
Gabe and Tess have him in a cab

10:26.301 --> 10:27.901
<i>going West on Houston,</i>
<i>medallion</i>

10:27.935 --> 10:29.069
<i>number 2-7-B-3.</i>

10:29.103 --> 10:30.103
What? How do they even...?

10:30.138 --> 10:30.937
Yeah, apparently, they've

10:30.972 --> 10:32.439
been spying on me.

10:32.474 --> 10:33.641
I don't think
they know about the picnic,

10:33.675 --> 10:35.075
but see why I don't trust Gabe?

10:35.109 --> 10:36.009
He's worse than the NSA.

10:36.044 --> 10:38.711
Okay, Houston, Houston.

10:38.745 --> 10:42.148
Let me see if I can get anything
that will help out of the NSA

10:42.183 --> 10:43.583
before we ditch 'em. I'm back.

10:43.617 --> 10:45.218
Houston and Broadway.
Where is he?

10:45.252 --> 10:46.452
He just turned right
onto Bowery,

10:46.487 --> 10:48.621
but are you sure
you can follow our directions?

10:48.656 --> 10:49.622
What's that supposed to mean?

10:49.657 --> 10:50.823
Okay, he's on Delancey.

10:50.857 --> 10:52.825
Vincent was in your building
for 27 minutes, and

10:52.859 --> 10:53.893
you didn't notify us.

10:53.927 --> 10:55.093
I didn't have time.

10:55.127 --> 10:56.895
Maybe you shouldn't be
lecturing her right now.

10:56.929 --> 10:59.731
I'm just saying, we're supposed
to be working together.

10:59.765 --> 11:00.899
<i>I am, I'm turning on Delancey.</i>

11:00.933 --> 11:02.367
See, working together.

11:03.969 --> 11:05.470
<i>He's headed</i>

11:05.505 --> 11:07.639
to the Williamsburg Bridge.
We have to get to him

11:07.674 --> 11:08.840
before we lose jurisdiction.

11:08.874 --> 11:09.874
On it, one sec.

11:11.042 --> 11:12.577
Today's our lucky day.

11:12.611 --> 11:13.977
They're about
to lose jurisdiction.

11:14.012 --> 11:15.846
What? How is that lucky?

11:16.715 --> 11:18.916
Gabe,

11:18.950 --> 11:21.319
uh, no, it's just
that we found him again.

11:21.353 --> 11:23.287
Uh, but since you guys can't
see him, I really need to focus.

11:23.322 --> 11:24.455
I'll call you back.

11:24.489 --> 11:26.756
Okay, that is
not working together.

11:26.790 --> 11:28.391
Told you not to lecture her.

11:29.460 --> 11:31.494
Is he going to La Guardia?

11:31.529 --> 11:32.529
Maybe you need to check flights.

11:32.563 --> 11:33.996
I would, except now

11:34.031 --> 11:35.432
he's taking the Hazen Bridge.

11:35.466 --> 11:38.000
But that-that goes to Rikers.

11:38.035 --> 11:39.135
What's he doing there?

11:39.169 --> 11:40.203
I don't know,

11:40.238 --> 11:41.838
but Rikers isn't an experience

11:41.872 --> 11:43.171
you guys used to experience.

11:43.206 --> 11:45.107
Maybe you should
call Tess for backup.

11:45.141 --> 11:46.675
Right now, Tess means Gabe,

11:46.710 --> 11:48.544
and that's not the kind
of backup I need.

11:48.578 --> 11:49.911
And your best friend, Vincent,

11:49.946 --> 11:52.080
doesn't either.

12:06.662 --> 12:08.329
Better be dinner.

12:08.364 --> 12:10.531
Relax, Carlos.

12:10.566 --> 12:12.967
I know you like to think this
is some five-star restaurant,

12:13.001 --> 12:14.534
but even with your pull,

12:14.569 --> 12:15.935
the best we could do was two.

12:22.744 --> 12:24.511
Carlos?

12:33.019 --> 12:34.987
I'm the doctor on call.

12:35.021 --> 12:36.322
How long was he seizing?

12:36.356 --> 12:38.257
Maybe ten minutes.
Found this in his cell.

12:38.292 --> 12:39.792
I'll get that analyzed.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.327
Okay, nurse,

12:41.361 --> 12:44.697
get me 25 diazepam,
70 phenobarbital,

12:44.731 --> 12:46.292
and let's get
an inhibation tray set up.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.768
Where is your asset?

12:51.069 --> 12:53.237
You know, the one that keeps

12:53.272 --> 12:55.206
your little empire going
round and round.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.777
How do I find him?

13:00.680 --> 13:01.780
Hey.

13:02.714 --> 13:04.114
Where are you?

13:04.148 --> 13:05.549
Um...

13:05.583 --> 13:07.217
Look, I'm sorry if you felt

13:07.251 --> 13:08.885
like I was siding
with Gabe this morning.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.220
I'm just worried about you.

13:10.254 --> 13:11.855
You don't need to worry
about me.

13:11.889 --> 13:14.391
Just tell me where you are.

13:16.294 --> 13:17.394
Rikers.

13:17.429 --> 13:18.429
By yourself?

13:18.463 --> 13:20.130
Okay, now you sound like Gabe.

13:20.164 --> 13:22.699
No, Cat, it's just the last time

13:22.733 --> 13:23.800
that you tracked Vincent
by yourself,

13:23.835 --> 13:25.935
you were almost killed.

13:25.969 --> 13:27.369
Hello?

13:27.403 --> 13:29.438
Cat?

13:29.472 --> 13:31.273
Did you hang up on me?

13:31.308 --> 13:33.475
Why are you following me?

13:33.509 --> 13:35.144
I'm trying to help.

13:35.178 --> 13:36.745
Cat, look,
just wait for me.

13:36.779 --> 13:38.214
We'll track him together.

13:38.248 --> 13:40.515
It doesn't sound
like help to me.

13:43.618 --> 13:44.699
What are you doing?

14:03.861 --> 14:06.630
Are we on a boat?

14:07.164 --> 14:09.132
Vincent?

14:11.869 --> 14:15.805
Vincent, I know you're there.

14:15.840 --> 14:19.574
Maybe if you just took
off this blindfold.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.910
It's kind of scary under here.

14:23.212 --> 14:25.313
You know,
they're gonna track my phone.

14:25.348 --> 14:26.715
They won't have any luck.

14:26.750 --> 14:28.684
So it is you.

14:28.718 --> 14:31.053
And of course
you did something to my phone.

14:31.087 --> 14:32.387
You're a smart guy.

14:32.421 --> 14:34.488
Not feeling so smart right now.

14:34.523 --> 14:35.857
Because of this?

14:37.425 --> 14:39.360
You couldn't know
I would show up

14:39.394 --> 14:40.795
or that the guards
would be there.

14:40.829 --> 14:42.396
You-you panicked.
It happens.

14:42.430 --> 14:45.399
I mean about showing up
on your rooftop.

14:51.739 --> 14:54.007
Who are you?

14:54.042 --> 14:57.343
I told you,
I'm your girlfriend.

14:57.378 --> 14:59.713
You got no proof, no photos.

14:59.747 --> 15:01.081
Now you're stalking me.

15:01.115 --> 15:02.448
You jumped off my roof.

15:02.483 --> 15:03.884
I was concerned.

15:03.918 --> 15:06.085
And I catch you trying
to talk to someone

15:06.119 --> 15:07.553
about tracking me down.

15:07.587 --> 15:08.721
My partner.

15:08.755 --> 15:11.623
You killed someone

15:11.658 --> 15:13.525
in Central Park.

15:13.560 --> 15:16.228
Of course the cops
are gonna be looking for you,

15:16.262 --> 15:18.597
but-but I told you,
I'm protecting you.

15:18.631 --> 15:20.566
I get it;
you were exacting revenge.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.567
It's a little more complicated
than that.

15:22.601 --> 15:23.768
Complicated how?

15:23.803 --> 15:25.203
My turn to ask
the questions.

15:25.237 --> 15:26.771
Does it have something
to do with Rikers?

15:26.806 --> 15:27.972
What did I just say?

15:28.007 --> 15:31.142
I'm just trying to connect.

15:31.177 --> 15:33.812
And I don't know,
maybe you are, too.

15:33.846 --> 15:36.147
You showed up on my roof.

15:36.182 --> 15:37.381
You brought me here.

15:37.416 --> 15:39.116
I just kidnapped you.

15:39.150 --> 15:41.284
I don't see how that's a sign
of wanting to connect.

15:41.319 --> 15:43.120
You could've just killed me
then and there.

15:43.154 --> 15:45.655
Not that I want
to give you any ideas.

15:45.690 --> 15:47.991
Well, I was trying to stop you
from messing things up.

15:48.026 --> 15:49.492
Messing what up?

15:49.527 --> 15:51.695
You don't get to ask
the questions; I do.

15:54.664 --> 15:56.799
If you're trying to figure out

15:56.834 --> 15:58.267
whether or not
you can trust me,

15:58.301 --> 16:00.669
just think about it.

16:00.704 --> 16:02.338
I've known
what's been done to you,

16:02.372 --> 16:04.107
and I haven't told anyone.

16:04.141 --> 16:08.611
And I know you can sense
when someone's lying.

16:08.645 --> 16:11.679
I don't know how it works,
but maybe if you just took

16:11.714 --> 16:15.083
this blindfold off,
you would see.

16:31.633 --> 16:34.635
I need to look
into your eyes to know that.

16:47.681 --> 16:49.382
Thank you.

16:50.751 --> 16:53.119
I have to work.

16:53.154 --> 16:55.054
No more questions.

16:59.292 --> 17:01.093
Okay, so I just got
off the phone with Rikers,

17:01.094 --> 17:02.961
and they say her car
isn't there.

17:02.996 --> 17:04.496
So I'm just clinging
to the theory

17:04.530 --> 17:06.371
that she hung up on me
and she's off connecting

17:06.398 --> 17:07.833
with her amnesiac boyfriend.

17:07.867 --> 17:09.667
You ever hear of
Carlos Hernandez?

17:09.702 --> 17:11.636
International cartel leader?

17:11.671 --> 17:13.505
One of the most
sought after drug kingpins

17:13.539 --> 17:15.372
until he ended up in Rikers.

17:15.406 --> 17:17.374
You about blow
up my theory?

17:17.409 --> 17:18.709
Earlier tonight,

17:18.742 --> 17:20.211
a sniper shot some sort

17:20.244 --> 17:21.512
of seizure-inducing medication

17:21.546 --> 17:22.746
into Carlos's cell.

17:22.781 --> 17:24.816
That's not a no.

17:28.153 --> 17:29.320
It was Vincent
in order to get Carlos

17:29.354 --> 17:31.021
to the infirmary.

17:31.055 --> 17:32.655
Take a look
at the on-call doctor

17:32.690 --> 17:34.390
who treated him.

17:34.425 --> 17:35.792
His alias is Dr. Braunstein.

17:35.827 --> 17:37.227
How'd he get this?

17:37.261 --> 17:38.661
I don't know, maybe Muirfield

17:38.696 --> 17:39.996
gave it to him
before they were blown up.

17:40.031 --> 17:41.731
The question is
why did Vincent

17:41.765 --> 17:43.533
go to all the trouble
to get to Carlos?

17:43.567 --> 17:47.536
No, the question is what does
any of this have to do with Cat?

17:47.570 --> 17:48.804
And where the hell is she?

17:58.148 --> 17:59.882
Looks like
you've been here a while.

18:01.218 --> 18:02.917
That was...

18:02.952 --> 18:04.785
That was more of an observation

18:04.820 --> 18:06.620
than-than a question.

18:16.265 --> 18:17.931
You taking a break?

18:17.966 --> 18:19.900
Okay, that-that was a question.

18:19.934 --> 18:21.434
Look, I don't have anything

18:21.469 --> 18:23.871
for motion sickness,

18:23.905 --> 18:25.505
but, uh, I got some water.

18:25.539 --> 18:27.074
Oh.

18:27.108 --> 18:29.743
Yeah, that's another thing
about me.

18:29.777 --> 18:31.879
I'm really not great with boats.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.685
Here.

18:44.324 --> 18:45.324
More?

18:45.359 --> 18:47.093
No, thank you.

18:47.127 --> 18:50.061
But, um, acupressure
has worked in the past.

18:50.096 --> 18:52.297
Let me guess.

18:52.331 --> 18:55.466
On your wrists?

18:55.501 --> 18:58.736
It doesn't really make any sense
for you to keep my tied up.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.238
I can't outrun you.

19:00.273 --> 19:01.839
I can't overpower you.

19:01.874 --> 19:05.743
And you're clearly good
with pressure points.

19:05.778 --> 19:08.078
That thing you did
with my neck earlier...

19:08.113 --> 19:11.581
Mm-hmm, so why would you
trust me now?

19:11.616 --> 19:14.318
Because I know
you won't hurt me.

19:53.430 --> 19:55.565
How's that?

19:55.835 --> 19:58.871
Better.

20:00.441 --> 20:02.808
I didn't mean
to get angry before.

20:02.842 --> 20:04.242
It's okay.

20:04.277 --> 20:06.311
You thought I was being a cop.

20:06.345 --> 20:09.848
Look, I don't even know why
I'm gonna tell you this,

20:09.883 --> 20:11.983
but you know, if you hadn't
have been looking for me,

20:12.018 --> 20:13.351
I have the strange feeling

20:13.386 --> 20:15.654
that I would have
shown up eventually.

20:15.688 --> 20:17.456
So maybe

20:17.490 --> 20:19.424
I did bring you here
for a reason.

20:19.458 --> 20:21.826
Not just because of the guards?

20:23.295 --> 20:25.696
There's this pull

20:25.731 --> 20:28.032
I can't explain.

20:28.066 --> 20:31.135
You know, it's like,
I'm over there working,

20:31.169 --> 20:33.671
and I can hear your heart beat.

20:33.705 --> 20:35.839
Must be very annoying.

20:37.542 --> 20:39.843
Distracting.

20:42.513 --> 20:46.215
So, what was
my favorite sandwich?

20:46.250 --> 20:48.251
Turkey and avocado.
Great sandwich.

20:48.285 --> 20:49.553
Mm-hmm.

20:51.254 --> 20:52.888
Are you hungry?

20:52.923 --> 20:55.390
Yeah, I am hungry.

20:55.425 --> 20:57.993
I don't know if I got turkey
and avocado,

20:58.027 --> 20:59.829
but I could make you something.

20:59.863 --> 21:01.296
Yeah, okay.

21:01.331 --> 21:03.799
All right.

21:18.726 --> 21:19.451
Hello?

21:19.452 --> 21:22.567
JT, it's Gabe. Uh, I need you
to track Catherine's phone.

21:22.568 --> 21:23.868
It's pinging all over the map.

21:23.903 --> 21:25.904
Looks like she's in 47 places

21:25.938 --> 21:27.228
in Manhattan alone.

21:27.229 --> 21:28.329
So Tess updated you?

21:29.897 --> 21:32.065
Oh, yeah,
filled me in on everything.

21:32.100 --> 21:33.200
Um, communication's key
to teamwork.

21:33.235 --> 21:34.968
Well, maybe you can

21:35.003 --> 21:36.504
persuade Catherine of that.

21:36.538 --> 21:38.404
Meanwhile, it seems like Vincent
has scrambled her phone,

21:38.439 --> 21:40.340
which means he doesn't want us
to find her.

21:40.374 --> 21:41.541
Oh, wait.

21:41.575 --> 21:43.476
Uh, I think she might be home.

21:44.578 --> 21:46.546
Tess.

21:46.580 --> 21:47.813
What are you doing here?

21:47.848 --> 21:48.914
Are you at Catherine's?

21:50.117 --> 21:51.451
What is the tranq doing here?

21:55.255 --> 21:57.856
Okay, look, she wanted
to have a picnic with him.

21:57.890 --> 21:58.990
A picnic?
A picnic?

21:59.025 --> 22:00.925
Yeah, that was their thing,

22:00.960 --> 22:02.694
and you two want to
put him in a cage.

22:02.728 --> 22:04.630
I want to protect
my friend.

22:04.664 --> 22:06.365
So do I.

22:07.400 --> 22:08.867
Look...

22:08.901 --> 22:10.268
You want to be
a good friend, JT?

22:10.302 --> 22:12.236
Then work with us,

22:12.271 --> 22:13.337
because he is in trouble.

22:13.372 --> 22:14.672
Maybe start by helping Tess

22:14.706 --> 22:16.440
figure out what
Catherine's password is.

22:16.475 --> 22:18.075
And I never said "cage."

22:18.109 --> 22:19.710
What password?

22:19.744 --> 22:21.379
Her car GPS.

22:21.413 --> 22:22.713
The company won't give me
location without it,

22:22.747 --> 22:24.282
and I can't get
a warrant,

22:24.316 --> 22:25.782
'cause no one can know
she's missing.

22:25.816 --> 22:27.450
Well, have you tried
the name "Vincent"?

22:32.056 --> 22:35.358
So I like turkey,
avocado, <i>Jaws,</i>

22:35.393 --> 22:38.361
and my musical tastes
were stuck in the '90s?

22:38.396 --> 22:39.596
Not entirely.

22:39.630 --> 22:40.963
Wait, do you
remember the '90s?

22:40.998 --> 22:42.531
Well, I remember facts,

22:42.566 --> 22:45.901
like Bill Clinton,
flannel shirts, Nirvana.

22:45.935 --> 22:47.570
I just don't have

22:47.604 --> 22:49.137
any memory of
personal experiences.

22:50.273 --> 22:52.074
Makes me a better soldier.

22:52.108 --> 22:54.843
Soldier for what?

22:54.877 --> 22:57.245
I told you, I can't.

22:57.279 --> 23:00.215
But Muirfield's gone.

23:02.518 --> 23:04.952
Look, why don't
you tell me

23:04.986 --> 23:06.654
about our
first date.

23:09.057 --> 23:10.825
Well, we didn't
really have

23:10.859 --> 23:12.827
an official
first date.

23:12.861 --> 23:14.661
We couldn't really
go out anywhere,

23:14.696 --> 23:16.062
we didn't go to restaurants
or movies...

23:16.097 --> 23:17.264
We couldn't?

23:17.298 --> 23:18.965
No.

23:18.999 --> 23:20.567
Muirfield was
looking for you,

23:20.602 --> 23:24.170
and you were
concerned about...

23:24.205 --> 23:25.639
losing control.

23:25.673 --> 23:27.974
So we didn't
go anywhere?

23:28.008 --> 23:30.976
Wow, I sound like
an amazing boyfriend.

23:31.010 --> 23:33.912
We had picnics on my roof.

23:33.947 --> 23:35.948
But those took a while, too.

23:35.982 --> 23:37.816
You know, you kept
telling me to stay away.

23:37.851 --> 23:39.785
But you didn't.

23:39.819 --> 23:42.688
Now that does
sound familiar.

23:44.324 --> 23:46.124
Well, I think
you said it

23:46.158 --> 23:47.492
'cause you wanted
to protect me.

23:47.526 --> 23:48.593
I don't think
you actually

23:48.628 --> 23:50.462
wanted me
to stay away.

23:50.496 --> 23:52.731
I'm sure I didn't.

23:55.067 --> 23:58.035
Why don't you tell me
about our first kiss?

23:58.070 --> 23:59.937
Well, um...

23:59.972 --> 24:02.939
that happened...
way before

24:02.974 --> 24:04.875
our first
unofficial date.

24:04.909 --> 24:06.143
Mm-hmm.

24:06.177 --> 24:08.379
Also on my roof.

24:08.413 --> 24:10.347
Okay, see,
this picnic thing

24:10.382 --> 24:12.549
is beginning
to make sense now.

24:12.584 --> 24:14.318
I thought if we
re-experienced things,

24:14.352 --> 24:15.419
it might trigger
something.

24:28.198 --> 24:29.499
Anything?

24:29.533 --> 24:31.801
Not yet.

24:31.835 --> 24:34.235
♪ Rust or gold

24:34.270 --> 24:35.870
♪ You decide

24:35.905 --> 24:39.708
♪ What you see
and what you hold ♪

24:39.742 --> 24:42.711
♪ Let it burn
there in your hand ♪

24:42.745 --> 24:43.978
♪ Watch it grow

24:44.013 --> 24:45.246
Now?

24:45.281 --> 24:46.815
♪ Watch it grow

24:46.849 --> 24:49.184
♪ Breath of life
come and fill your lungs ♪

24:49.218 --> 24:51.852
You know, we did more
than just kiss.

24:51.886 --> 24:54.021
♪ And give it away
until it's gone ♪

24:54.055 --> 24:56.990
♪ Or hold it in
and let it die ♪

24:57.025 --> 25:01.094
♪ Let it die, let it die.

25:01.391 --> 25:04.092
If I knew that was part
of your rooftop plan,

25:04.127 --> 25:05.494
I never would
have jumped.

25:08.998 --> 25:10.900
What?

25:10.934 --> 25:13.035
I'm just
wondering if...

25:13.069 --> 25:15.970
that triggered
anything.

25:16.004 --> 25:18.039
Maybe...

25:18.073 --> 25:19.240
if we did
it again?

25:25.180 --> 25:26.681
Nothing, really?

25:35.423 --> 25:37.524
I have work to do.

25:40.094 --> 25:42.295
You should probably
get dressed.

25:47.868 --> 25:50.336
It's just...

25:50.370 --> 25:52.505
if that doesn't bring things
back, I don't know what will.

25:52.539 --> 25:54.006
Maybe it's better that way.

25:54.040 --> 25:55.207
Why?

25:55.241 --> 25:56.876
So you can be
a better soldier?

25:56.910 --> 25:58.110
Muirfield's gone.

25:58.144 --> 25:59.979
Unless something
else is going on.

26:01.381 --> 26:02.582
Come on.

26:02.616 --> 26:03.748
What, we're
going somewhere?

26:03.783 --> 26:06.084
Not "we."

26:06.118 --> 26:07.452
Me.

26:07.487 --> 26:09.253
What?
Are you kidding?

26:09.288 --> 26:11.255
Okay, I just ask you
a few questions,

26:11.290 --> 26:12.524
and we don't
trigger any memories,

26:12.558 --> 26:13.758
but after what we just did?

26:13.793 --> 26:15.093
I know, I just...

26:15.127 --> 26:16.227
I can't have you
following me, okay?

26:16.261 --> 26:18.530
I don't want you to get hurt.
Ow.

26:18.564 --> 26:19.997
You're just gonna leave me here?

26:20.031 --> 26:21.365
What if I have to pee?

26:28.839 --> 26:29.839
Thank you.

26:32.409 --> 26:34.777
Vincent.

26:34.812 --> 26:36.312
I'll be back soon.

26:36.346 --> 26:38.047
Vincent, you can't
just leave me here.

26:39.182 --> 26:41.283
Vincent!

26:56.365 --> 26:58.933
Don't be mad,
I only figured it out

26:58.967 --> 27:01.235
'cause the lady
at the GPS company

27:01.269 --> 27:02.236
said it began with

27:02.270 --> 27:03.404
the letter "N."

27:03.438 --> 27:04.772
Nope, just
surprised.

27:04.806 --> 27:06.507
I mean, you're her
new password, okay.

27:06.542 --> 27:08.342
Me?
No, "Nutty Professor"

27:08.376 --> 27:10.411
is Cat's favorite smoothie.

27:10.445 --> 27:12.013
I got her into them
because she was so nervous

27:12.047 --> 27:13.327
about Vincent,
she wasn't eating.

27:13.348 --> 27:14.581
You guys find anything?

27:14.615 --> 27:15.615
Not yet.

27:15.650 --> 27:16.950
Look, JT, pull up

27:16.984 --> 27:18.144
that map of Catherine's cell.

27:18.152 --> 27:20.186
Find the ping closest
to where we are right now...

27:20.220 --> 27:21.855
We find her, good thinking.

27:21.889 --> 27:23.523
All right.

27:23.558 --> 27:25.592
I got a fast food wrapper,

27:25.626 --> 27:27.661
It's suspicious, given Cat
doesn't eat fast food.

27:27.695 --> 27:28.895
She eats smoothies.

27:28.930 --> 27:31.196
That's mine.

27:32.632 --> 27:35.200
We spent a lot
of time together

27:35.234 --> 27:36.535
looking for Vincent.

27:39.472 --> 27:42.841
Closest ping's at
the 79th Street Boat Basin.

27:42.876 --> 27:44.944
So are they
on a boat?

27:44.978 --> 27:47.478
Yeah.
Yeah, he's probably

27:47.512 --> 27:48.873
gondoliering her
around the Hudson.

27:48.881 --> 27:50.648
JT... you find
the phone

27:50.683 --> 27:52.316
of a missing
person by water,

27:52.350 --> 27:53.588
it usually means
they're underneath it.

27:53.613 --> 27:54.019
Tess...

27:54.020 --> 27:55.920
No, this is his fault.

27:55.921 --> 27:58.890
He enabled her:
the picnic, the smoothies.

27:58.924 --> 28:00.058
I'm telling you
right now,

28:00.092 --> 28:01.525
if your
deranged friend

28:01.560 --> 28:02.826
did anything to hurt
Cat, it's on you.

28:02.860 --> 28:03.961
Look, now is
not the time

28:03.995 --> 28:05.062
to be pointing
fingers.

28:05.096 --> 28:06.529
Oh, well,
let me guess,

28:06.564 --> 28:07.798
it's the time to be
communicating?

28:07.832 --> 28:09.466
You know, Cat would
be communicating

28:09.500 --> 28:11.401
with me, but she thinks
I'm working with you.

28:11.435 --> 28:12.502
So it's your fault, too.

28:14.072 --> 28:16.339
I hate this situation so much.

28:16.373 --> 28:17.474
Fine, you're off the case.

28:17.508 --> 28:19.408
<i>- What?</i>
- Fine.

28:19.442 --> 28:20.576
Let's go.

28:20.611 --> 28:21.877
Actually, you're
not going either.

28:21.912 --> 28:23.813
You just said
I was part of the team.

28:23.847 --> 28:26.482
Look, computers--
yes, guns-- no.

28:26.516 --> 28:27.984
You are both
too close to this.

28:28.018 --> 28:29.852
There is a reason
doctors don't operate

28:29.886 --> 28:32.321
on family members.
You'd be trigger-happy,

28:32.355 --> 28:34.223
and you'd be
trigger-shy.

28:34.257 --> 28:35.590
I'm going
in alone.

28:35.625 --> 28:36.858
Look, I'm the one

28:36.892 --> 28:38.259
who has to earn
Catherine's trust.

28:41.998 --> 28:44.465
Fan-friggin'-tastic.

29:14.128 --> 29:15.695
Ah...

29:16.730 --> 29:19.032
NYPD!

29:20.801 --> 29:22.501
Of course.

29:24.937 --> 29:26.872
Vincent's not here,

29:26.906 --> 29:29.908
so how about
instead of snooping around,

29:29.942 --> 29:31.342
you come down here
and untie me?

29:34.580 --> 29:35.847
Are you okay?

29:37.817 --> 29:40.484
Mildly humiliated, but fine.

29:40.518 --> 29:42.419
So get it all out.
"I told you so,"

29:42.453 --> 29:45.556
"It was stupid of you
to be alone with him."

29:45.590 --> 29:47.091
Are you all right?

29:47.125 --> 29:49.259
I will be, once I figure out
what's going on.

29:49.294 --> 29:51.128
I need to see what's
in his computer.

29:51.163 --> 29:53.898
So this is
Vincent's, huh?

29:53.932 --> 29:55.531
He say who's
paying for it?

29:57.101 --> 29:58.835
Look, you already
tried this alone,

29:58.869 --> 30:01.104
and you ended up tied
to a chair on the floor,

30:01.138 --> 30:02.972
and he's MIA
again, so...

30:03.007 --> 30:05.742
Okay, all I know is that
he was working on something.

30:05.776 --> 30:08.578
It seemed important
and he left in a hurry.

30:08.612 --> 30:10.680
Working,
or direct-messaging?

30:10.714 --> 30:12.848
Who's Gina Garolo?
Garolo was the name

30:12.882 --> 30:14.449
of Carlos
Hernandez's rival.

30:14.483 --> 30:16.785
That's who Vincent
went to Rikers to see.

30:16.820 --> 30:18.653
He posed as a Dr. Braunstein
to get to him.

30:18.688 --> 30:20.856
Maybe it had something
to do with Gina.

30:20.890 --> 30:22.691
She's a nursing student
from Miami.

30:22.726 --> 30:23.859
Yeah, who's hugging

30:23.893 --> 30:24.927
Joe-Joe Garolo,

30:24.961 --> 30:26.095
international
cartel leader.

30:26.129 --> 30:27.195
at a family
barbecue.

30:27.229 --> 30:29.296
If Carlos
were to harm her,

30:29.331 --> 30:31.132
it would certainly
send a message.

30:31.166 --> 30:32.700
Maybe Vincent
went to Rikers

30:32.735 --> 30:34.135
to get his
marching orders.

30:35.637 --> 30:36.871
You think that Vincent

30:36.905 --> 30:38.940
is Carlos's hired assassin now?

30:38.974 --> 30:40.141
And what,
he's using social media

30:40.175 --> 30:41.675
to track down
his targets?

30:41.710 --> 30:43.376
Muirfield
weaponized people.

30:43.410 --> 30:45.045
That's what that
organization was about,

30:45.079 --> 30:46.479
and they didn't do it for
humanitarian reasons,

30:46.513 --> 30:47.714
they did it
for money.

30:47.749 --> 30:49.149
A ton of money,

30:49.183 --> 30:51.118
which someone like
Carlos Hernandez has.

30:51.152 --> 30:53.486
Vincent did say
they wiped his memory

30:53.520 --> 30:54.821
to make him a better soldier.

30:54.856 --> 30:56.990
Maybe by "solider"
he meant "assassin."

30:57.024 --> 31:01.127
Wait, did you say that Vincent
posed as a Dr. Braunstein?

31:01.161 --> 31:02.995
BraunsteinMD's
been messaging Gina.

31:03.029 --> 31:04.997
She's having a party

31:05.031 --> 31:08.134
at a club tonight
to celebrate mid-terms.

31:08.168 --> 31:09.802
"He'll see her there."

31:09.836 --> 31:12.337
We have to get to her
before he does.

31:19.245 --> 31:21.246
Gina?

31:21.280 --> 31:22.981
BraunsteinMD.

31:23.015 --> 31:24.883
Nice to meet you
in person, doctor.

31:24.917 --> 31:26.651
Oh, please,
just call me Derek.

31:26.685 --> 31:29.053
Derek.

31:29.088 --> 31:31.655
Uh, these are my friends.

31:31.689 --> 31:34.992
Hey.
This is Derek, the doctor.

31:35.026 --> 31:36.226
Hey, do you want
to go somewhere

31:36.261 --> 31:37.701
we can actually hear
each other talk?

31:38.997 --> 31:40.397
We'll be back.

31:40.431 --> 31:41.832
She was totally
checking you out, man!

31:48.243 --> 31:50.664
If this is such a cool
underground club,

31:50.665 --> 31:52.722
then why do they
know you here?

31:52.906 --> 31:54.346
In my former life,
I used to be cool.

31:54.373 --> 31:56.541
Now I spend
all my time...

31:56.575 --> 31:57.810
Don't say saving me.

32:02.515 --> 32:03.748
It's a perfect place
to kill someone.

32:03.783 --> 32:05.083
You can't hear
yourself think.

32:05.118 --> 32:06.885
You really aren't
cool anymore.

32:06.920 --> 32:08.986
We should
split up.

32:09.021 --> 32:11.155
♪ With the highest highs
and the lowest lows ♪

32:11.190 --> 32:12.790
Should we sit?

32:12.825 --> 32:14.692
You know what? I think
it's quieter out here.

32:25.102 --> 32:27.037
Are you okay?

32:27.071 --> 32:28.538
Yeah. Uh...

32:28.572 --> 32:29.940
Do you know what?

32:29.974 --> 32:31.641
Could you just
wait right here?

32:31.675 --> 32:33.195
I'll be back in...
in one second, okay?

32:33.210 --> 32:35.712
Don't move.

32:35.746 --> 32:37.447
♪ Take me home...

32:37.481 --> 32:40.416
Hey! What are you doing here?

32:40.451 --> 32:42.284
Vincent, I know about Gina.
I saw your messages to her.

32:42.319 --> 32:44.019
You can't do this.

32:44.054 --> 32:45.287
Okay, were you
this possessive before?

32:45.322 --> 32:47.723
'Cause you're like a dog
with a bone, okay?

32:47.757 --> 32:49.190
We are not boyfriend
and girlfriend.

32:49.225 --> 32:50.625
You think that's
what this is about?

32:50.626 --> 32:51.993
I'm trying to stop you
from killing her.

32:52.027 --> 32:54.229
What?

32:54.263 --> 32:55.930
Okay, I think you need to leave.

32:55.965 --> 32:58.633
That's what you went to see
Carlos about at Rikers, right?

32:58.668 --> 33:00.301
I am not here to kill her.

33:00.336 --> 33:02.371
I am here to protect her.

33:03.505 --> 33:05.138
From what?

33:06.908 --> 33:08.976
Vincent!

33:09.010 --> 33:11.712
Vincent!

33:11.747 --> 33:13.146
I'm flattered that you came.

33:13.181 --> 33:15.215
It's really nice
to finally meet you, but I

33:15.250 --> 33:16.784
was just in the middle
of something.

33:16.818 --> 33:18.386
Alone in a VIP room?

33:18.420 --> 33:20.487
He said he was
coming right back.

33:20.521 --> 33:22.489
- Right.
- Excuse me, Gina?

33:22.523 --> 33:24.123
This the guy?

33:24.157 --> 33:25.725
No.
Can I talk to you?

33:25.760 --> 33:28.060
What's going on, Officer?
We need to get her

33:28.095 --> 33:29.362
out of her.
For your safety.

33:30.330 --> 33:31.564
Did my friend
send you here

33:31.599 --> 33:33.600
so that I'm fashionably late
to my own party?

33:33.634 --> 33:35.067
I'm afraid
it's more than that.

33:35.102 --> 33:36.735
Maybe you should
listen to him.

33:36.770 --> 33:39.671
This leads to the back
alley. I'll take her.

33:39.706 --> 33:41.172
Gina!
Derek!

33:41.207 --> 33:43.074
Wait! What's going on?

33:43.109 --> 33:44.209
Get out of my way.

33:44.243 --> 33:45.411
I can't do that.

33:51.950 --> 33:54.251
Help!

33:56.187 --> 33:57.722
Run. Go.

34:42.764 --> 34:44.732
What happened?

34:48.670 --> 34:50.772
There are more
of them out there.

34:59.693 --> 35:01.661
Gabe said she's fine.

35:01.695 --> 35:03.496
Well, I'd like
to hear it from her.

35:03.530 --> 35:05.097
Although I guess
I should be used

35:05.131 --> 35:06.692
to being cut out
of the loop these days.

35:08.067 --> 35:09.534
Maybe she texted <i>you.</i>

35:09.568 --> 35:12.004
Tess, I'm not trying to
steal your best friend.

35:12.038 --> 35:14.072
I'm just looking
out for mine.

35:14.107 --> 35:17.843
But... I'm sorry if
it seems like I...

35:17.877 --> 35:19.511
Enabled?

35:19.545 --> 35:23.414
Cat was very convincing
about her plan...

35:23.448 --> 35:26.217
and I guess I just
wanted to believe

35:26.251 --> 35:29.053
that Vincent's still the same
guy I've been... living with,

35:29.087 --> 35:32.190
<i>protecting</i> for the past decade.

35:32.224 --> 35:34.859
You know, I'm sorry
about what's happened to him.

35:34.893 --> 35:36.526
It's horrible, but I...

35:36.560 --> 35:39.095
You need to look out
for <i>your</i> best friend.

35:39.130 --> 35:41.764
Exactly. Even if that means
siding with Gabe

35:41.799 --> 35:43.333
or...

35:43.367 --> 35:46.136
not knowing
her favorite smoothie.

35:48.639 --> 35:50.606
You miss her.

35:50.641 --> 35:53.175
I do.

35:54.677 --> 35:57.980
Hey... at least
she knows who you are.

36:02.819 --> 36:05.888
You know... maybe I should
start siding with you.

36:07.957 --> 36:10.758
I'll share my antacids.

36:10.792 --> 36:13.761
I have a feeling
we're gonna need them.

36:13.795 --> 36:15.263
Yeah.

36:23.272 --> 36:24.804
<i>She's okay.</i>

36:24.839 --> 36:25.973
A little shaken up.

36:26.007 --> 36:27.074
But thankfully,
she didn't

36:27.108 --> 36:27.941
actually see anything.

36:27.976 --> 36:29.943
How are you?

36:29.978 --> 36:32.645
I'm a little bruised,
mostly my ego.

36:32.680 --> 36:35.482
No more humiliating than
being found tied to a chair.

36:35.516 --> 36:36.950
So we're even, then.

36:36.985 --> 36:38.818
Although actually,
I may be one up.

36:38.853 --> 36:40.354
You remember when
we were talking

36:40.388 --> 36:43.022
about how Muirfield
weaponized people for money?

36:43.056 --> 36:45.492
Well, I did some digging
into Carlos's financials.

36:45.526 --> 36:48.595
It turns out 18 months
ago he paid $7 million

36:48.629 --> 36:51.097
to a subsidiary
owned by Zhao.

36:51.131 --> 36:52.031
Muirfield.

36:52.065 --> 36:53.966
So Carlos bought...

36:54.001 --> 36:55.034
Someone like Vincent.

36:55.068 --> 36:56.635
That guy from the club.

36:56.669 --> 36:58.103
Probably Carlos's muscle.

36:58.137 --> 37:00.105
That must be how
he maintained control

37:00.139 --> 37:02.107
of his empire
from inside prison.

37:02.141 --> 37:04.610
So Vincent went to Rikers
to get Carlos to tell him

37:04.644 --> 37:06.111
where he was.
But Carlos

37:06.145 --> 37:07.212
only knew
his target.

37:07.246 --> 37:09.281
So Vincent used Gina as bait.

37:10.583 --> 37:12.850
Nice work.

37:12.885 --> 37:14.652
And you aren't even
an official detective.

37:14.686 --> 37:17.688
But, you know,
this suggests that

37:17.723 --> 37:19.957
Vincent doesn't need
to be in a cage.

37:19.991 --> 37:21.426
He saved Gina's life.

37:21.460 --> 37:24.128
He isn't some
out-of-control killer.

37:24.162 --> 37:25.663
He's not out of control.

37:25.697 --> 37:28.799
But if Carlos bought and owned
that guy from the club,

37:28.833 --> 37:30.901
then maybe somebody
bought Vincent.

37:30.935 --> 37:32.702
Someone may be
controlling him,

37:32.737 --> 37:35.472
and that certainly doesn't
mean he's not dangerous.

37:35.506 --> 37:38.542
Catherine, I understand
why you don't trust me,

37:38.576 --> 37:39.910
given our past,

37:39.944 --> 37:42.011
but whatever is
going on with Vincent

37:42.046 --> 37:44.147
is bigger than we thought.

37:44.181 --> 37:47.215
If there really are more...

37:47.250 --> 37:49.184
beasts out there,

37:49.218 --> 37:51.487
then we need to work together.

38:10.639 --> 38:11.873
♪ Night

♪ Got nothing on your life

38:15.744 --> 38:17.077
♪ Got nothing...

38:17.111 --> 38:18.078
Hi.

38:18.112 --> 38:20.781
Did you have a memory?

38:20.815 --> 38:22.749
No.

38:22.784 --> 38:25.719
Sorry I keep asking that.

38:25.753 --> 38:27.420
It's just...

38:27.455 --> 38:29.523
you used
to write me notes,

38:29.557 --> 38:31.859
and a lot of them
said "roof."

38:33.560 --> 38:36.362
But I've realized
that memory's overrated.

38:36.396 --> 38:39.264
I mean, you saved
someone's life-- that's...

38:39.299 --> 38:42.034
what you do,
it's who you are.

38:42.068 --> 38:44.003
And we get to have
all of our firsts together--

38:44.037 --> 38:45.404
who gets to do that?

38:45.438 --> 38:48.340
Look, I came here
to return your phone.

38:49.942 --> 38:52.477
Uh... thank you.

38:52.512 --> 38:54.779
And...

38:54.814 --> 38:57.616
apologize for...

38:57.650 --> 38:59.885
for tying you up.

38:59.919 --> 39:02.721
I forgive you.

39:02.755 --> 39:04.955
And I thought...

39:04.990 --> 39:07.525
maybe we <i>could</i> have that picnic.

39:08.627 --> 39:09.927
I mean, not right now, but...

39:09.961 --> 39:12.862
Good, because JT ate all of it.

39:13.864 --> 39:16.566
That... that was a joke.

39:16.600 --> 39:20.737
Um, but he did eat all of it.

39:20.771 --> 39:22.639
This is hard.

39:22.673 --> 39:24.173
What is?

39:24.207 --> 39:26.275
This. Um...

39:26.309 --> 39:30.012
I'm-I'm not... I'm not
supposed to do this.

39:31.714 --> 39:34.082
Vincent, that guy
who was after Gina,

39:34.116 --> 39:35.984
someone bought him
from Muirfield.

39:36.019 --> 39:37.786
Someone owned him.

39:37.820 --> 39:41.256
Is that what's going on?
Excuse me?

39:41.290 --> 39:43.458
You just said that
you're "not supposed to."

39:43.492 --> 39:45.092
Says who?

39:45.126 --> 39:47.428
Who pays for that boat?
Who told you to go to Rikers?

39:47.462 --> 39:49.296
Because Muirfield's gone.
I thought you understood

39:49.330 --> 39:50.698
that you can't ask
certain questions.

39:50.732 --> 39:53.300
And you know that you can
trust me, so why are you torn?

39:53.334 --> 39:55.269
Is someone controlling you?
No.

39:55.303 --> 39:57.137
Okay, the fact that
you're getting angry

39:57.172 --> 39:59.273
makes me think that
I've hit a nerve.

39:59.307 --> 40:01.441
No, it's because I come
up here, I think we're

40:01.475 --> 40:03.276
goa a hang out, and you
start interrogating me.

40:03.310 --> 40:05.311
I am trying to help you.
I don't need your help.

40:05.345 --> 40:07.113
Yes, you do!

40:07.147 --> 40:09.449
They took you
for three months, and now

40:09.483 --> 40:12.052
you don't remember
who you are, or me,

40:12.086 --> 40:13.653
or anything else.
Is that what this is about?

40:13.688 --> 40:15.249
'Cause guess what?
I <i>don't</i> remember you.

40:15.255 --> 40:17.656
Okay, and I told you,
that is fine for now.

40:17.691 --> 40:19.959
But you need to let me in.

40:19.993 --> 40:21.560
No, I don't.

40:21.595 --> 40:24.329
Okay, so what, that's it?

40:24.363 --> 40:26.398
You just let
whoever this is win?

40:26.432 --> 40:28.067

we've been through?

40:28.101 --> 40:29.534

40:39.078 --> 40:41.513
I don't even know
