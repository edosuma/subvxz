WEBVTT

01:45.188 --> 01:46.856
Any change?

01:46.856 --> 01:48.691
Nope, still asleep.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.156
You found him?

01:56.032 --> 01:57.075
Yeah, I think so.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.201
You need back up?

01:59.118 --> 02:00.578
No, no. I can handle it.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.540
You need to be here to...

02:04.874 --> 02:05.959
Could you just...

02:05.959 --> 02:07.377
Could you give her
a hug for me?

02:07.377 --> 02:10.046
In case she wakes up
before I get back.

02:10.046 --> 02:12.173
You just concentrate
on getting Keeg.

02:13.675 --> 02:15.718
Then hurry home
and you can hug her yourself.

Are you fucking serious?

04:20.927 --> 04:23.346
Which one of you bitches...

04:25.556 --> 04:29.227
Okay. Okay, fine. I get it.

04:29.227 --> 04:31.104
What I was doing
was a little weird,

04:31.104 --> 04:34.565
maybe it was wrong,
and dangerous,

04:34.565 --> 04:36.943
but like, Chinchillas do it
and shit,

04:36.943 --> 04:40.405
so like, really can it be...
Is it really that fucking bad?

04:41.281 --> 04:43.616
I... Fuck!

04:44.784 --> 04:45.702
No.

04:47.286 --> 04:49.539
Shit.

04:49.539 --> 04:54.961
I know better,
and I know things
are all fucked up for us.

04:54.961 --> 04:58.381
And you guys are right.
Maybe I shouldn't be...

04:58.381 --> 05:00.550
But that doesn't give you
the right, though.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.386
It just doesn't give you
the right to just
pull me down here

05:03.386 --> 05:08.266
out of fucking nowhere
without warning and just--

05:08.266 --> 05:10.727
What are you talking about?

05:10.727 --> 05:12.395
No one pulled you down here.

05:14.564 --> 05:15.648
Sorry, what?

05:15.648 --> 05:19.152
Yeah, you just showed up
on your own.

05:20.611 --> 05:23.823
Wait. What were you
doing exactly?

05:24.615 --> 05:25.533
Um...

05:28.911 --> 05:30.872
Nothing. Yeah, nothing.

05:33.207 --> 05:37.211
Just, um... Yeah, I was just...

05:39.922 --> 05:40.840
Okay.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.760
I'll see you guys later.

05:49.265 --> 05:51.017
Oh, yeah.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.811
It looks like
the old girl still got
some life left in her.

05:53.811 --> 05:57.565
Yeah. I bet you will have her
in tip-top shape
before you know it.

05:57.565 --> 06:01.611
Easy now, she's still
a bonafide hunk of shit.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.322
But, um...

06:05.364 --> 06:07.075
Thank you, Laura.

06:07.075 --> 06:11.079
I think this is the nicest
thing that anyone's
ever done for me.

06:11.079 --> 06:15.416
Ah! After hearing you go on
and on about your daddy issues,

06:15.416 --> 06:19.712
your grand-daddy issues
and your tactile sensations,
how could I not?

06:19.712 --> 06:22.590
I didn't realize I was going on
and on about it, but...

06:22.590 --> 06:26.677
Just saying
that you know, the best cure
for the body is a quiet mind.

06:26.677 --> 06:30.640
Everyone deserves their own
private slice of peace.

06:30.640 --> 06:34.977
I hope she gives you many hours
in which to lose yourself in.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.315
Holy shit!

06:40.733 --> 06:42.819
The radio still works.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.865
So, what have you lot
been up to?

06:51.160 --> 06:52.328
Willoughby?

06:52.328 --> 06:54.288
It's like that fuzzy little
cunt said.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.960
The whole world is abuzz
with chatter.

06:58.960 --> 07:04.966
Immortus is rising,
and just like everything else
in the godforsaken universe,

07:04.966 --> 07:06.759
it all leads back to you lot.

07:09.303 --> 07:11.931
Uh, who the fuck's Immortus?

07:13.808 --> 07:15.059
Gather the others.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.479
I'm not repeating myself.

07:21.732 --> 07:22.733
What was that?

07:44.422 --> 07:45.798
Ageing spots?

07:53.723 --> 07:54.599
No.

07:55.558 --> 07:57.977
Oh, no.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.317
Oh.

08:14.202 --> 08:17.997
It's okay, bud.
I can feel you. I'm coming.

08:25.171 --> 08:26.422
What the...

08:26.422 --> 08:29.967
Keeg, just... just hold on.

08:33.721 --> 08:34.555
Oh, God.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.745
By all means,
just help yourself.

09:01.958 --> 09:02.875
Top left.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.391
Finally.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.642
Morning, princess.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.398
Why do you look so sweaty?

09:27.358 --> 09:30.069
I don't know,
why do you look so boring?

09:30.069 --> 09:35.491
All right. Something very big
and very dangerous
is headed our way.

09:37.743 --> 09:41.163
I can assure you,
it is far bigger,
and far more dangerous

09:41.163 --> 09:44.417
than anything you bellends
have ever seen before.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.626
- Ooh.
-"Bellend."

09:50.923 --> 09:52.842
I thought it was all
just legend.

09:55.803 --> 09:57.305
Tall tales...

10:00.308 --> 10:03.769
about an ancient forgotten God.

10:03.769 --> 10:08.190
But, as it turns out,
Immortus is real.
And it's coming.

10:08.190 --> 10:14.030
We're wandering into
the literal end of days
as we speak.

10:14.030 --> 10:18.617
Uh, actually, we took care
of the end of the world
last week.

10:18.617 --> 10:22.538
Consider the butts wiped.
Front to back.

10:25.666 --> 10:29.462
I'm not talking about
some arses with teeth!

10:29.462 --> 10:31.255
This is an
inter-dimensional deity

10:31.255 --> 10:36.385
capable of swallowing
the entirety
of existence whole!

10:36.385 --> 10:39.347
This could be the end
of reality as we know it.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.976
Oh, fuck me senseless
and call me Martha.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.811
The Immortus Project!

10:45.811 --> 10:50.316
At the Bureau. I knew I'd heard
that name before.

10:50.316 --> 10:54.904
It was some kind of experiment,
a pursuit of immortality.

10:54.904 --> 10:59.241
But as I recall it, it didn't
amount to anything, so.

10:59.241 --> 11:01.702
Actually, that's exactly why
I'm here.

11:01.702 --> 11:05.623
Caulder always swore
he had a piece of Immortus.
I never believed him.

11:05.623 --> 11:11.796
And yet here I am,
amidst the results
of his little pet enterprise:

11:11.796 --> 11:13.297
The Immortus Project.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.593
Well, except for you
and tracksuit.

11:17.593 --> 11:21.764
Wait, what do you mean
by "results"?

11:21.764 --> 11:22.973
You're the project.

11:24.683 --> 11:26.769
A long time ago,

11:26.769 --> 11:30.272
a piece of the fabled deity
was procured,

11:30.272 --> 11:34.443
passing through many hands
in many shady dealings
and backrooms.

11:34.443 --> 11:38.280
Whispers proclaimed
that it held the secrets
of immortality.

11:38.280 --> 11:43.869
Whoever adorned it
would be gifted
with an unnaturally long life.

11:43.869 --> 11:48.249
That same piece came to be
in the hands of one
Eric Morden.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.291
Mr. Nobody?

11:49.875 --> 11:51.001
Exactly.

11:51.001 --> 11:53.337
And he had it right up
until he was shot

11:53.337 --> 11:55.923
by the famous adventurer, scientist,

11:55.923 --> 11:59.260
and certifiable bastard
that we all know,

11:59.260 --> 12:01.971
or rather, knew as--

12:01.971 --> 12:04.014
Fuckin' Chief.

12:04.014 --> 12:05.808
Had it around his neck
for years.

12:05.808 --> 12:08.811
That was, until he went all
<i>Honey I Shrunk the Kids</i>

12:08.811 --> 12:10.896
and he needed it
to bail you out.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.566
But before all of that,
small pieces of the necklace

12:13.566 --> 12:17.319
were shaved off and mixed in
with the sugar, spice
and all things nice

12:17.319 --> 12:20.990
that make up Larry,
Rita, Cliff,

12:20.990 --> 12:23.325
and little miss manic pixie
over there.

12:23.325 --> 12:24.952
I mean,
haven't you ever wondered

12:24.952 --> 12:29.582
why you've looked exactly
the same for decades?

12:30.958 --> 12:35.129
Longevity. <i>A la</i> Immortus.

12:35.129 --> 12:39.091
So what now?
Immortus wants his pieces back?

12:39.091 --> 12:41.635
Look at that. Quick as ever,

12:41.635 --> 12:44.680
even without a super computer
jammed up your arse.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.265
Mm.

12:46.265 --> 12:49.059
There was a break-in
at Horst Eismann's
a few weeks ago.

12:49.059 --> 12:50.895
Millions of dollars
of bits-and-bobs

12:50.895 --> 12:54.023
and the only thing
that was stolen
was the necklace.

12:54.023 --> 12:58.110
Safe to say, whoever's working
for Immortus now has it

12:58.110 --> 13:00.613
and is looking
for the other pieces.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.907
And before you ask, yes.

13:02.907 --> 13:06.160
The pieces inside of you
can still be extracted,

13:06.160 --> 13:11.040
like gold, or uranium,
or a blackhead.

13:11.040 --> 13:14.960
So, and this is the really
important bit,

13:14.960 --> 13:19.965
just so long as you don't lose
your longevity,

13:19.965 --> 13:25.930
the necklace cannot be reconstituted.
And Immortus cannot rise.

13:28.057 --> 13:33.646
So what does the extraction
process look like exactly?

13:34.730 --> 13:36.732
What?

13:36.732 --> 13:39.902
Uh, well, you know, is it like
someone getting sucked into
their own filmography?

13:39.902 --> 13:45.115
Or maybe, is attacked
by a weirdo named Dr. Janus--

13:45.115 --> 13:47.743
Who also happens to be
an emotional vampire.

13:47.743 --> 13:52.540
There are no depths
to your collective stupidity,
are there?

14:01.048 --> 14:04.885
Come on, Niles,
you crazy old bat.

14:07.555 --> 14:12.059
There must be something.

14:12.810 --> 14:13.894
Ugh.

14:33.914 --> 14:35.374
"Fountain of youth."

14:39.712 --> 14:43.841
"10 Ways to Stay Young
and Keep Him Interested."

14:44.383 --> 14:45.342
Ugh!

15:02.109 --> 15:03.110
Ooh.

15:05.571 --> 15:08.616
"Experimental." "Untested."

15:15.998 --> 15:17.333
Hello.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.965
Let's see what you can do.

15:28.719 --> 15:31.180
Jesus Christ!

15:31.180 --> 15:33.932
What the hell happened
to your face?

15:40.272 --> 15:42.358
I think we got bigger problems
than that right now.

15:50.866 --> 15:53.118
- What's happening?
- That's me, let go.

15:56.413 --> 15:57.748
What is happening?

16:02.461 --> 16:04.713
What the yee-haw fuck?

16:08.342 --> 16:09.426
What the fuck?

16:14.139 --> 16:15.766
What the fuck?

16:15.766 --> 16:20.229
Oh, my God!
Look who's got metal back!

16:20.229 --> 16:22.481
Shut up, Hot Topic.

16:22.481 --> 16:26.026
Yes! It worked!
It actually worked!

16:26.026 --> 16:28.278
Although, I can't recall
the last time I wore...

16:29.697 --> 16:33.200
Oh, my God. 1937.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.412
That was a de-aging spell you...

16:36.412 --> 16:39.331
Whatever the female equivalent
of a dick-head is!

16:39.331 --> 16:40.457
Clit-head?

16:40.457 --> 16:42.793
Uh, well, excuse me.

16:42.793 --> 16:45.921
If Cliff didn't rushed in
like some brainless buffoon--

16:45.921 --> 16:48.298
Hey! How is this my fault?

16:48.298 --> 16:50.759
Hold up. Did you just say
"de-aging spell"?

16:50.759 --> 16:54.555
Yes, you daft cunts.
We're all teenagers again. Duh.

16:54.555 --> 16:57.808
Uh, that's bullshit
'cause we all pretty
much look the same.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.894
Do you feel the same?

17:00.894 --> 17:03.814
Kinda.
Except I also feel like
pounding a metric ton

17:03.814 --> 17:06.191
of Taco Bell and whacking off.

17:06.191 --> 17:11.071
Do you need a mirror?
'Cause you still look
like 1,000 years old.

17:11.071 --> 17:14.992
Clearly, it's not a very good
de-aging spell.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.494
Probably why it was
in a locked box

17:17.494 --> 17:25.544
marked "experimental,"
"untested," and "dangerous."

17:25.544 --> 17:31.425
By the way, aging works
a little differently
for Chaos Magicians.

17:31.425 --> 17:36.430
How does your hairline
not come in until you're
at least a million?

17:36.430 --> 17:37.681
Ha! Burn!

17:38.724 --> 17:40.309
For your information,

17:40.309 --> 17:45.189
teenage Chaos Magicians
are notoriously
folically gifted.

17:46.732 --> 17:51.528
Wow.

17:51.528 --> 17:56.325
Does aging
work differently for
bird-lady ottomans too?

17:56.325 --> 17:58.911
Oh, no. I just...
I held my breath.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.288
Years old Bureau training
kicked in.

18:01.288 --> 18:05.876
"If you see a cloud of smoke,
don't breathe, don't choke."
It's simple.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.006
No, no.

18:11.006 --> 18:16.804
This is a Khepri hex.
This is bad.
Really, really bad.

18:18.430 --> 18:19.348
Ah...

18:25.354 --> 18:26.480
What the hell?

18:29.191 --> 18:30.442
State your name.

18:33.695 --> 18:35.906
Rama, sir.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.741
Do you go by any other names?

18:40.369 --> 18:42.663
Mr. 104, sir.

18:42.663 --> 18:46.166
When and where
were you born, Mr. 104?

18:46.166 --> 18:49.753
1928, Tamil Nadu.
In India, sir.

18:49.753 --> 18:51.839
At the height
of the British Raj.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.424
What made you decide
to move to London?

18:54.424 --> 18:57.219
I wanted to study
the physical sciences, sir.

18:57.219 --> 18:59.221
Organic chemistry, specifically.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.056
Is this truly your story?

19:03.308 --> 19:05.561
I'm sorry, sir?

19:05.561 --> 19:07.062
Everything you've just said
to me.

19:07.062 --> 19:09.565
Do you believe this information
to be true?

19:11.400 --> 19:12.860
Yes, sir. I swear, sir.

19:13.652 --> 19:14.778
Remarkable.

19:16.572 --> 19:17.906
Subjects, enter.

19:25.998 --> 19:30.794
Mr. 104, you can begin
with air augmentation
experiment now.

19:34.423 --> 19:35.883
Now, sir?

19:35.883 --> 19:40.095
Commence with air augmentation,
Mr. 104, as instructed.

19:40.095 --> 19:42.514
- But they're--
- They're Agents of the Bureau.

19:42.514 --> 19:47.769
Everything that happens here
is in service of our freedom,
Mr. 104. They understand that.

19:47.769 --> 19:50.731
- Yes, but--
- Our nation's freedom
is paramount.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.941
Do you understand, Mr. 104?

19:59.156 --> 20:00.449
Yes, sir.

20:00.449 --> 20:03.660
Good. Begin air augmentation.

20:38.528 --> 20:39.529
What the...

21:09.184 --> 21:11.395
Experiment complete.

21:11.395 --> 21:14.731
Thank you, Mr. 104.
That'll be all.

21:37.796 --> 21:40.799
"Not Polly." We meet again.

21:45.762 --> 21:46.722
Keeg!

21:53.228 --> 21:57.816
I understand you're confused,
and you think I'm your enemy.

21:57.816 --> 21:59.443
I just want my kid.

22:02.446 --> 22:05.323
Please, just let him go.

22:05.323 --> 22:07.284
You think I'm doing this
on purpose?

22:07.284 --> 22:08.869
I've been trying
to get rid of him.

22:08.869 --> 22:11.580
No matter what I do,
he won't leave.

22:23.508 --> 22:27.054
Once again my work
has gone unappreciated.

22:27.054 --> 22:29.848
Well, I for one think
we all look fabulous.

22:30.932 --> 22:32.976
Well, except for Vic.

22:32.976 --> 22:34.436
But I'm sure,

22:34.436 --> 22:37.230
um, when you get those things
out of your mouth--

22:37.230 --> 22:40.108
Will you just shut the fuck up?

22:41.818 --> 22:43.361
I'm trying to find her.

22:47.574 --> 22:49.701
I'm fucking stripped.

22:49.701 --> 22:54.456
Oh, I can barely get
this location spell to work.

22:54.456 --> 22:57.959
Oh, of course.

22:57.959 --> 23:01.046
Is it true your kind don't get
your proper magic

23:01.046 --> 23:03.423
till you've lost
your virginity?

23:03.423 --> 23:06.176
Dude! Your V-seal grew back?

23:06.176 --> 23:10.138
And so what? Why should
we fight this anyway?

23:10.138 --> 23:13.975
We should be enjoying our time
as virile youths.

23:13.975 --> 23:15.143
Gross.

23:15.143 --> 23:18.105
Except that we don't have
any time at all.

23:18.105 --> 23:23.735
You didn't stumble into
any old run-of-the-mill
youthification spell, Rita.

23:23.735 --> 23:25.737
This is a curse.

23:25.737 --> 23:31.201
And it'll keep on de-aging us.
First teenagers, then children,
then babies.

23:31.201 --> 23:35.163
All the way back
to that little spark
in your daddy's eye.

23:35.163 --> 23:38.625
And then, well, nothing.

23:38.625 --> 23:41.128
We'll be jizzified?

23:41.128 --> 23:42.045
Ugh.

23:43.505 --> 23:46.174
My old mentor, Ms. April.

23:46.174 --> 23:50.720
She's the only one that I trust
to help us out of this mess.

23:50.720 --> 23:54.182
So if I can just have
two fucking seconds of silence,

23:54.182 --> 23:57.435
I might be able to find her
teleporting tea room.

23:57.435 --> 24:04.276
Right. So we can take you there
to get your V-card punched. Nice.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.027
That's not what I meant.

24:10.574 --> 24:11.950
Ah. There she is.

24:13.618 --> 24:15.162
Toledo.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.830
Isn't that like two towns over?

24:16.830 --> 24:20.709
Pedal to the metal, Cliff.
Fast as you can.

24:22.419 --> 24:25.338
Road trip! Woo-hoo!

24:43.106 --> 24:45.650
Welcome back, Captain Trainor.

24:45.650 --> 24:48.695
Keeg. Keeg, stop this.

24:49.654 --> 24:51.656
Can you hear me? Stop this.

24:51.656 --> 24:53.074
Subjects, enter.

24:57.495 --> 24:59.539
No, no. Keeg.

25:01.166 --> 25:04.753
No, no, no. Please!

25:04.753 --> 25:10.133
Let me out!

25:29.194 --> 25:30.779
Time is of the essence!

25:30.779 --> 25:32.197
Got it, Dad!

25:34.324 --> 25:36.660
Hey, get me a hot dog.

25:36.660 --> 25:41.373
Ooh, and a couple of Paydays.
And some Takis.

25:41.373 --> 25:44.084
Fucking nerd.

25:45.543 --> 25:47.170
Teen metabolism.

25:47.170 --> 25:49.881
- So, BFF...
- Ew.

25:49.881 --> 25:53.426
Do you think
we'd be friends if we were
in high school together?

25:53.426 --> 25:56.304
- Ha!
- What?

25:56.304 --> 25:59.474
- Weren't you like
a popular kid or some shit?
- So?

26:01.142 --> 26:02.060
Whatever.

26:03.311 --> 26:05.146
I wasn't even around back then.

26:05.146 --> 26:07.190
I'm glad I skipped high school

26:07.190 --> 26:12.487
and that whole
"awkward hormonal stage"
bullshittery.

26:12.487 --> 26:15.282
Aw, come on! It's not all bad.

26:15.282 --> 26:19.327
The "awkward hormonal stage"
is kind of what makes a person
who they are.

26:19.327 --> 26:22.831
The chaos, the confusion,
the lakeside fingerings,

26:22.831 --> 26:24.833
the mistakes... All of it.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.668
Really?

26:26.668 --> 26:30.046
Drinking in playgrounds,
and copping a feel

26:30.046 --> 26:32.424
behind the bleachers
made you who you are?

26:32.424 --> 26:36.469
Yeah. Actually,
I think some of that stuff
saved me.

26:37.387 --> 26:38.555
Hm.

26:38.555 --> 26:41.933
- Anyway, speaking of hormones--
- Oh, God.

26:41.933 --> 26:44.769
I haven't forgotten about
our little conversation...

26:47.731 --> 26:48.982
Hey!

26:48.982 --> 26:50.275
Come on.

26:54.529 --> 26:57.282
Hey, Euphoria, can I get a hit?

26:58.533 --> 27:00.201
Well, excuse me.

27:00.201 --> 27:03.455
Can I have an introduction
or something
before we swap spit?

27:03.455 --> 27:04.956
Yeah, I'm Jane.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.751
- This is, Cliff.
- Howdy?

27:07.751 --> 27:12.547
Love
the Woodstock core vibes.

27:12.547 --> 27:16.801
And the whole
yassified cyber-cowboy thing.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.888
Super cute.

27:19.888 --> 27:23.058
- Uh...
- Fuck yes, dude.

27:23.058 --> 27:28.646
You look like my racist grandpa
but, like, fresh as fuck.

27:28.646 --> 27:30.440
Why, thank you, dude.

27:30.440 --> 27:33.068
Thank you. Thank you very much.

27:33.068 --> 27:36.321
Yeah, okay, cool.
So, introduction's over...

27:36.321 --> 27:39.407
- Ahem...
- Oh, hold on.

27:39.407 --> 27:42.994
We're actually in need
of a little favor ourselves.

27:42.994 --> 27:45.955
A six-pack of lite beer
for these basic bitches

27:45.955 --> 27:49.042
and a bottle
of the finest brandy for me.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.420
I bet your tall friend
never gets carded.

27:53.046 --> 27:54.172
What do you say?

27:58.301 --> 28:00.595
Okay.

28:00.595 --> 28:02.138
Yeah, whatever,
sure, it's cool.

28:07.018 --> 28:08.353
Wow, okay.

28:10.271 --> 28:11.106
Actually...

28:11.106 --> 28:12.607
Okay.

28:12.607 --> 28:13.775
No.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.237
After you, dear leader.

28:19.030 --> 28:19.906
Rita...

28:26.496 --> 28:27.872
Rita.

28:27.872 --> 28:30.250
I just wanna talk to you
about this leadership thing.

28:30.250 --> 28:34.129
If you think
I'm going to have
a heart-to-heart with you

28:34.129 --> 28:36.214
while a used condom
stares at me

28:36.214 --> 28:38.341
from a broken
diaper changing table,

28:38.341 --> 28:40.260
you've got
another thing coming.

28:42.470 --> 28:45.265
This will
all be over soon.

28:45.265 --> 28:48.893
We'll go to Ms. April's
and she'll fix everything.

28:48.893 --> 28:54.107
I will be my ol' normal self,
before Janus.

28:54.107 --> 28:56.317
Did Willoughby say
she could fix this?

28:56.317 --> 28:57.735
The aging?

28:57.735 --> 28:59.362
I just assume--

28:59.362 --> 29:02.699
Okay, uh, you're gonna have to
lower your expectations here.

29:02.699 --> 29:05.118
Niles spent almost a century

29:05.118 --> 29:08.246
searching for a way to stop
the aging process.

29:08.246 --> 29:10.999
There were experiments, expeditions,

29:10.999 --> 29:12.917
you know, if there was
an answer out there

29:12.917 --> 29:16.504
that didn't have a hex
attached to it,
he would've found it.

29:17.881 --> 29:18.756
But he didn't.

29:21.759 --> 29:22.844
Rita?

29:30.727 --> 29:31.728
Rita?

29:38.860 --> 29:40.069
Where
are you going?

29:43.615 --> 29:44.491
Where she going?

29:44.491 --> 29:45.992
Just go on, we'll catch up.

29:48.453 --> 29:51.039
No. That's not the plan.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.504
Fuck's sake, what now?

29:58.796 --> 29:59.631
Heads up.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.261
Yo, where's my Takis?

30:05.261 --> 30:07.722
Takis? Interesting.

30:08.806 --> 30:10.475
<i>Enchante.</i>

30:10.475 --> 30:13.144
While you two
were mucking around,
we lost Rouge and Rita.

30:13.144 --> 30:14.395
Oh, boo-hoo.

30:14.395 --> 30:15.897
Yeah, that's too bad.

30:15.897 --> 30:18.483
But, great news, our new BFFs,

30:18.483 --> 30:20.902
Charlie, Jeremy and Winona

30:20.902 --> 30:23.321
were just mentioning
this super-cool party.

30:23.321 --> 30:24.614
Are you
out of your mind?

30:24.614 --> 30:26.866
We're on a mission here, remember?

30:27.575 --> 30:28.743
Immortus?

30:28.743 --> 30:30.578
End of reality?

30:30.578 --> 30:32.330
Man, why is this shit
always on us anyway?

30:32.330 --> 30:34.832
It's always, "You guys have to
defeat the eye in the sky

30:34.832 --> 30:36.125
or it'll delete everyone."

30:36.125 --> 30:37.585
Oh, yeah,
I forgot about that.

30:37.585 --> 30:38.878
That shit was fucking bananas.

30:38.878 --> 30:40.547
That happened during
our homecoming.

30:40.547 --> 30:41.673
- Oh, my God, what?
- Oh, shit.

30:41.673 --> 30:44.592
- You're so right.
- Shut up!

30:44.592 --> 30:47.804
Shut up. Shut up.
Shut up, shut up!

30:50.515 --> 30:51.933
We're getting in the car,

30:51.933 --> 30:54.936
without the cast
of <i>Freaks and Geeks</i> after dark.

30:54.936 --> 30:56.938
We're gonna see Ms. April,

30:56.938 --> 31:01.109
so I don't have to go back
to my father's hairy gooch.
You understand?

31:08.533 --> 31:09.993
Square.

31:09.993 --> 31:10.994
Excuse me?

31:10.994 --> 31:17.875
Square. Square. Square.

31:17.875 --> 31:24.048
Virgin. Virgin.
Virgin. Virgin.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.426
Fine! Fine!

31:28.553 --> 31:29.637
We can go for five minutes.

31:29.637 --> 31:30.972
- My man.
- Yes!

31:30.972 --> 31:32.140
Fuck, yeah!

31:34.767 --> 31:36.311
<i>Let me out.</i>

31:36.311 --> 31:37.812
Please let me go.

31:37.812 --> 31:40.148
Begin experiment.

31:40.148 --> 31:46.654
No. Oh, please. Please.
Keeg, stop this, please! No.

31:46.654 --> 31:48.615
Get away from me. Get away.

31:48.615 --> 31:50.241
We have to get out
of here, please.

31:50.825 --> 31:51.868
Please.

31:51.868 --> 31:54.037
Oh, God.

31:54.037 --> 31:56.831
Keeg. Keeg. Make it stop.

31:56.831 --> 32:00.001
Please. No. Please.

32:00.001 --> 32:01.544
Keeg, make it stop!

32:01.544 --> 32:03.296
Make it stop, please!

32:04.839 --> 32:06.924
Keeg, make it stop.

32:06.924 --> 32:09.177
Make it stop, please.

32:09.177 --> 32:10.887
Please make it stop, Keeg.

32:15.683 --> 32:17.685
No!
Get away from me!

32:17.685 --> 32:18.936
- It's okay.
- Don't touch me.

32:18.936 --> 32:21.648
It's okay. Just breathe.

32:21.648 --> 32:24.233
In and out.

32:24.942 --> 32:26.235
Keep going.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.867
I can turn my skin to lead.

32:34.452 --> 32:36.037
You can't hurt me.

32:37.413 --> 32:38.581

35:14.278 --> 35:15.947
Shut up and puff.

35:15.947 --> 35:18.616
It's Willoughby's.
Wizard-grade kush.

35:23.287 --> 35:25.081
Shit.

35:25.790 --> 35:27.041
I knew it.

35:28.084 --> 35:29.335
Nerd.

35:29.335 --> 35:31.587
What?

35:31.587 --> 35:36.425
I just had a feeling you were
a cliche, goody-two-shoes.

35:37.468 --> 35:38.469
You know.

35:39.262 --> 35:40.471
Teacher's pet.

35:40.471 --> 35:42.223
Captain of the sports and shit.

35:42.223 --> 35:45.393
Right, right. Yeah.

35:45.393 --> 35:46.602
What were you like?

35:48.187 --> 35:51.065
Actually I don't know.

35:51.065 --> 35:53.776
Miranda was the teenager

35:53.776 --> 35:57.905
and Kay shit me out
of her brain way later.

35:57.905 --> 36:03.119
So, I guess you could say
this is my first experience
in teenage-hood.

36:03.995 --> 36:04.996
Nice.

36:05.997 --> 36:06.956
So...

36:07.832 --> 36:08.875
what's the verdict?

36:10.209 --> 36:12.044
It's like...

36:12.044 --> 36:17.049
a janky carnival ride
that makes you wanna puke,

36:17.049 --> 36:19.886
but also one
you don't wanna get off.

36:21.470 --> 36:23.681
Yeah, sounds like you're having
a genuine experience.

36:24.515 --> 36:26.434
Great.

36:26.434 --> 36:31.022
So being a kid is
just as complicated
as everything else.

36:33.190 --> 36:35.443
Yeah.

36:35.443 --> 36:37.194
But some things
are simple...

36:37.945 --> 36:39.071
Pure.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.657
Friendship for instance.

36:41.657 --> 36:45.786
Detroiticons!

36:45.786 --> 36:47.455
When I was
in middle school,

36:47.455 --> 36:50.124
I made the most genuine friends
I could've ever asked for.

36:50.124 --> 36:52.501
All the complicated shit
felt easier because of it.

36:52.501 --> 36:55.463
Are these the friends
you went to see the other day?

36:56.213 --> 36:57.214
Yeah.

36:58.549 --> 37:01.093
It's just
different now.

37:04.388 --> 37:05.765
I left it too long, I guess.

37:07.642 --> 37:08.976
Shit's fucked up.

37:08.976 --> 37:11.312
Man, fuck that.

37:11.312 --> 37:18.903
If I had even the smallest
promise of a connection
like that out there,

37:18.903 --> 37:21.239
I'd do everything
it took to get it back.

37:23.699 --> 37:24.825
Yeah, well...

37:26.369 --> 37:28.037
I got a few things
on my plate.

37:28.037 --> 37:31.499
You know, the Butts, Immortus.

37:33.459 --> 37:35.127
Look, let me
tell you something.

37:36.253 --> 37:38.506
I'm starting to think

37:38.506 --> 37:42.301
that the world's always
gonna need rescuing.

37:43.469 --> 37:44.971
But you gotta wonder...

37:46.931 --> 37:50.101
when you're out there
saving the planet,

37:50.101 --> 37:52.019
who the fuck
is recuing you?

37:54.480 --> 37:56.107
You're so high right now.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.441
I'm pretty lit, yeah.

37:57.441 --> 37:59.610
You are so lit.

38:01.862 --> 38:03.906
- But you're also very right.
- Yeah.

38:05.032 --> 38:06.325
Yeah.

38:08.452 --> 38:09.412
Thanks.

38:10.913 --> 38:11.998
Yeah.

38:14.291 --> 38:15.626
<i>Adios, amigo.</i>

38:16.627 --> 38:17.753
Godspeed.

40:05.611 --> 40:06.612
Kay.

40:20.126 --> 40:21.001
Kay.

40:22.920 --> 40:23.963
I'm sorry.

40:26.841 --> 40:28.008
I know I fucked up.

40:30.594 --> 40:32.012
But what's new, right?

40:34.598 --> 40:36.600
I should've known better.

40:36.600 --> 40:40.563
I shouldn't even be
thinking about her
or anyone else.

40:40.563 --> 40:45.609
And I definitely shouldn't be
treating this body like
it was mine.

40:45.609 --> 40:48.529
I haven't even been
around long enough

40:48.529 --> 40:49.947
to see it...

40:51.282 --> 40:52.408
grow...

40:53.784 --> 40:55.077
how it's changed.

41:00.833 --> 41:02.042
It's not mine.

41:05.379 --> 41:06.380
It's yours.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.343
It's always been yours.

41:14.305 --> 41:15.556
I'm sorry.

41:21.145 --> 41:22.730
It's our body, Jane.

41:42.958 --> 41:44.251
Fuck.

41:44.251 --> 41:45.711
I am super-high.

41:57.932 --> 41:58.933
Willoughby!

42:00.100 --> 42:01.060
Jane?

42:03.187 --> 42:09.860
<i>♪ Am I talking to you
Or am I talking to the drugs? ♪</i>

42:09.860 --> 42:11.028
Shit!

42:36.345 --> 42:38.097
This is so unfair.

42:38.097 --> 42:40.266
And of course
you're perfectly fine.

42:40.266 --> 42:41.392
You always are.

42:42.393 --> 42:43.394
Rita...

42:46.480 --> 42:48.816
The spell didn't work on me,
I just...

42:50.442 --> 42:53.445
saw myself as a teenager
and I, I...

42:54.238 --> 42:55.656
couldn't.

42:55.656 --> 42:57.157
It was...

42:57.157 --> 42:58.826
a horrible time for me.

42:58.826 --> 43:01.954
A time I'd... rather forget.

43:01.954 --> 43:05.207
So, I used my ability
to change back.

43:06.333 --> 43:08.127
But, um,

43:08.127 --> 43:14.049
underneath this, I'm very much
not fine, Rita, believe me.

43:14.049 --> 43:16.343
Oh, that is so typical.

43:16.343 --> 43:17.344
What?

43:17.344 --> 43:20.597
You are such a control freak.

43:20.597 --> 43:22.182
I'm the control freak?

43:22.182 --> 43:24.018
I wish I had your power.

43:24.018 --> 43:27.021
Then I could be anything, anyone.

43:27.021 --> 43:30.190
I could disappear forever
and no one would be
able to find me.

43:30.190 --> 43:32.985
Okay. It's...
it's not that simple.

43:32.985 --> 43:34.111
Whatever.

43:41.618 --> 43:46.874
You know, a long time ago,
when people found out
about my power,

43:46.874 --> 43:50.210
they didn't react the way
you'd expected them to.

43:50.210 --> 43:54.882
I lost a lot of them.
People I thought
that I mattered to.

43:54.882 --> 43:57.301
And, you know,
when people think
about their teenage years,

43:57.301 --> 44:01.180
they think about
their first loves,
staying out late,

44:01.180 --> 44:02.931
dreaming big dreams...

44:04.975 --> 44:07.728
but, for me it was different.

44:07.728 --> 44:11.565
I think of that
freckled-faced girl
I used to be and I...

44:13.192 --> 44:14.318
I have this...

44:16.362 --> 44:18.155
like, burning,

44:19.156 --> 44:20.908
piercing hurt...

44:22.159 --> 44:23.827
right here.

44:27.206 --> 44:29.917
My mother used to always say

44:29.917 --> 44:31.585
that heartbreak
stains the soul.

44:31.585 --> 44:33.379
Well, I believe that
to be true.

44:36.090 --> 44:37.966
Except, for me, it's different.

44:40.427 --> 44:41.470
It's...

44:43.430 --> 44:44.515
like a void.

44:46.767 --> 44:47.768
A chasm...

44:51.230 --> 44:52.731
standing between me...

44:54.733 --> 44:58.779
and any hope of finding
a true, meaningful connection.

45:03.033 --> 45:04.993
Maybe that's why
I am the way I am.

45:07.621 --> 45:09.498
Maybe by now,
I'm the chasm.

45:12.668 --> 45:13.669
What about me?

45:15.379 --> 45:17.631
We used to be good friends,
didn't we?

45:19.383 --> 45:20.426
Rita.

45:20.426 --> 45:21.802
When I felt alone

45:21.802 --> 45:24.054
and lost, and like
I didn't even know myself,

45:24.054 --> 45:28.517
you're the one person
that made me feel like
everything was gonna be okay.

45:30.060 --> 45:31.145
I miss that.

45:32.521 --> 45:33.647
I miss you.

45:34.773 --> 45:37.234
But things are different now.

45:38.277 --> 45:40.070
You hurt me.

45:40.070 --> 45:44.241
And I'll never have
my best friend back ever again.

45:49.538 --> 45:51.039
I miss you, too.

45:52.249 --> 45:53.667
And I never stopped thinking

45:53.667 --> 45:57.171
about how I hurt you
and I am so...

45:57.171 --> 45:58.797
so sorry, Rita.

45:59.923 --> 46:01.383
I am.

46:01.383 --> 46:04.178
There's not a day that goes by
that I don't think about

46:04.178 --> 46:08.432
how I... I hurt you,
what I did to you,

46:08.432 --> 46:11.393
to Malcolm, and the Sisterhood.

46:11.393 --> 46:13.687
And I...

46:13.687 --> 46:16.690
I don't deserve
an ounce of forgiveness

46:16.690 --> 46:19.443
and I never will.

46:19.443 --> 46:22.196
I never will.
I am so, so sorry.

46:23.238 --> 46:24.656
I am so sorry.

46:47.012 --> 46:48.222
Chug! Chug!

46:51.058 --> 46:52.518
Cliff. Hey.

46:54.394 --> 46:56.813
- Jane?
- Yes, it's me, poop-bot.

46:56.813 --> 47:00.275
- Oh, hey,
Jane, what's up?
- We have to go, now.

47:00.275 --> 47:02.819
Um, who brought
the little vibe killers?

47:06.698 --> 47:09.660
It's cool.
It's cool, they're with me.

47:09.660 --> 47:11.745
Party on, party people.

47:11.745 --> 47:12.913
Party on!

47:12.913 --> 47:14.414
I know you're having
a jolly old time

47:14.414 --> 47:16.291
but we have to find Ms. April
right now,

47:16.291 --> 47:17.668
before this gets any worse.

47:17.668 --> 47:19.419
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

47:19.419 --> 47:21.964
- Cliff, come on.
- Leave me alone.

47:21.964 --> 47:24.758
What is wrong with you?
Why are you being so weird?

47:24.758 --> 47:27.719
Because I am weird, Jane. Okay?

47:27.719 --> 47:29.137
I am a weirdo.

47:29.137 --> 47:30.639
Look at my hand.

47:30.639 --> 47:33.433
Have you ever seen me without
this stupid oven mitt on?

47:34.518 --> 47:35.686
That's weird.

47:35.686 --> 47:37.437
What the fuck
are you talking about?

47:41.024 --> 47:43.110
It's all right, guys.
We're cool, we're cool.

47:43.110 --> 47:45.612
I'm cool.
We're cool. I'm cool.

47:45.612 --> 47:48.574
What say we take this party
to a new location?

47:48.574 --> 47:50.367
<i>Numero dos.</i>

47:53.954 --> 47:55.122
Are you crazy?

47:55.122 --> 47:56.748
You're gonna
pick some burnout teens

47:56.748 --> 47:59.084
to go party with over
your actual fucking friends?

47:59.876 --> 48:01.670
"Actual friends"?

48:01.670 --> 48:04.631
You mean the "actual friends"
who just want me to punch shit
for them?

48:04.631 --> 48:08.343
The "actual friends"
who didn't even care to ask
if I'm doing okay

48:08.343 --> 48:11.221
when, clearly, I am not.

48:13.724 --> 48:15.392
Party on, party people!

48:22.232 --> 48:23.609
Where the hell is Vic?

48:27.070 --> 48:28.071
Just pause it a second.

48:30.824 --> 48:32.284
What the--

48:32.284 --> 48:35.162
Derick... it's me Vic.

48:42.002 --> 48:43.086
Vic?

48:56.933 --> 49:00.979
That wasn't the first time
I've seen it, you know,
a piece of your past.

49:02.898 --> 49:04.024
Great.

49:04.024 --> 49:05.400
It's actually
quite illuminating.

49:08.028 --> 49:10.489
Seems to me you have
a little guardian angel.

49:12.282 --> 49:13.450
You mean Keeg?

49:13.450 --> 49:14.951
And the spirit before him.

49:16.787 --> 49:18.538
I see you've been through
a lot together.

49:24.127 --> 49:25.962
I joined Dr. Janus

49:25.962 --> 49:28.632
because I wanted to stop
causing suffering.

49:30.175 --> 49:31.385
But here I am.

49:32.302 --> 49:33.887
I'm a beacon for it.

49:33.887 --> 49:36.973
What... what do you mean by
"stop causing suffering"?

49:40.852 --> 49:42.938
I'm trying to reverse
my condition.

49:44.815 --> 49:47.442
The things that my body can do,
it's taking a toll.

49:48.485 --> 49:50.278
There are misfires

49:50.278 --> 49:52.614
from the changing compositions.

49:52.614 --> 49:55.242
One day I might not be
able to control it.

49:55.242 --> 49:56.660
What then?

49:56.660 --> 49:58.412
A mass extinction event.

50:00.789 --> 50:02.833
The only way I can stop it

50:02.833 --> 50:05.794
is if I fulfill the pledge
I made to Immortus,

50:05.794 --> 50:07.879
and return their longevity.

50:07.879 --> 50:09.506
Immortus?

50:09.506 --> 50:12.551
Pledge?
What are you talking about?

50:14.428 --> 50:19.182
Listen, I don't know
what you've gotten
yourself into exactly

50:19.182 --> 50:23.145
but I've been around long
enough to know a devil's
bargain when I see one.

50:24.020 --> 50:25.897
This doesn't sound right.

50:25.897 --> 50:30.402
What wasn't right was us
in that room being forced
to kill over and over again.

50:33.196 --> 50:35.657
Immortus can make
that all go away.

50:45.542 --> 50:47.043
Let me help you.

50:47.043 --> 50:48.128
What?

50:48.128 --> 50:49.796
What we went through,

50:49.796 --> 50:51.465
what you're going through,

50:52.716 --> 50:54.259
I get it.

50:54.259 --> 50:56.303
I also think
there's probably another way

50:56.303 --> 50:59.264
that doesn't have to involve
a pledge or violence.

51:00.515 --> 51:01.725
There always is.

51:02.392 --> 51:03.477
So...

51:05.854 --> 51:06.730
Larry.

51:14.029 --> 51:15.071
Rama.

51:26.333 --> 51:29.169
Really? So this was
your plan all along?

51:33.882 --> 51:35.592
What the hell?

51:35.592 --> 51:37.844
What? Hey. No!

51:39.054 --> 51:39.888
Larry!

51:42.432 --> 51:45.227
Fuck! This cannot be how I die.

51:45.227 --> 51:46.728
Oh, my God!

51:46.728 --> 51:48.939
Can you just let me turn into
a pile of splooge

51:48.939 --> 51:50.857
without all the whining
and screaming?

51:50.857 --> 51:55.862
My, my, my! You have been
a naughty little boy
haven't you, Willoughby?

51:55.862 --> 51:57.197
What are you doing here?

51:57.197 --> 51:58.698
To rescue you, of course.

52:27.269 --> 52:29.688
Willoughby? What's going on?

53:08.018 --> 53:10.103
Bunbury, please.

53:10.103 --> 53:11.771
Just take what you need
and be done with it.
