03:34.203 --> 03:37.122
Marianne!
Marianne, come on!

03:37.202 --> 03:39.922
- Marianne, we gotta go right now!
- Harry, we can't leave!

03:40.002 --> 03:43.082
- We can't leave! Not yet! No way!
- Right this second!

03:43.162 --> 03:46.082
- Look at these readings, honey!
- Forget the readings!

03:46.122 --> 03:48.481
Juan, Chico, get what you can
as quick as you can!

03:48.561 --> 03:50.721
- Where are the seismic records?
- We cannot wait!

03:50.801 --> 03:55.520
Come on, Marianne!
Come quick! Come on!

04:01.839 --> 04:03.880
I'll see you at the fort!

04:03.960 --> 04:06.079
Chico, stay close
behind us, okay?

04:06.159 --> 04:08.399
Oh, my God!
Come on! Get in!

04:08.479 --> 04:10.679
I hope they make it.
I hope they'll be okay.

04:22.476 --> 04:24.796
I can't even see the road,
sweetheart!

04:24.876 --> 04:28.517
You okay?

04:30.436 --> 04:32.955
If we make it through this...

04:33.035 --> 04:36.395
We're gonna have
some stories to tell, honey.

04:36.475 --> 04:39.474
Oh, shit, honey!

04:50.233 --> 04:52.233
We're gonna get out.
We're gonna get out. Don't worry.

04:55.473 --> 04:57.912
Marianne?

04:57.992 --> 05:02.472
Marianne? Marianne!

05:02.512 --> 05:05.271
Marianne! Oh, God!

05:05.351 --> 05:10.431
Oh, no! Oh, no!

05:22.909 --> 05:25.389
Harry Dalton here.
No one's home. Leave a message.

05:25.469 --> 05:29.109
Harry? Harry, are you there?

05:29.189 --> 05:32.668
Come on. Pick up.
Harry, I know you're there.

05:32.748 --> 05:37.867
We're picking up something in Northern
Cascades. I need your opinion on it.

05:37.947 --> 05:41.148
Get down here as soon as
you get this message.

05:41.228 --> 05:43.707
You better pack
for a couple of days.

05:43.787 --> 05:48.186
Harry, are you sure
you're not there?

06:02.464 --> 06:04.424
Take a big step.
Come on.

06:04.504 --> 06:07.424
Harry, what are you doing here?
You're supposed to be on vacation.

06:07.504 --> 06:10.863
Paul called. There's something
going on in the Northern Cascades.

06:10.943 --> 06:13.463
You can't leave work alone,
can you?

06:13.543 --> 06:15.942
Harry, goin' on vacation
isn't gonna kill ya.

06:19.102 --> 06:21.623
- I appreciate that. Thanks.
- Morning.

06:21.703 --> 06:24.142
So what's going on
in the Cascades?

06:24.222 --> 06:27.301
I'm sorry I had to drag you
in like this,

06:27.381 --> 06:31.100
but we are picking up some activity
around Dante's Peak.

06:31.180 --> 06:35.379
This is a joke, right?
Dante's Peak.

06:35.459 --> 06:40.140
What do you think the odds are against
an eruption up there? Thousand to one?

06:40.220 --> 06:42.139
More like 10,000 to 1.

06:42.219 --> 06:46.418
- What's the depth?
- Ten to twenty kilometers.

07:12.175 --> 07:15.174
Come on!
Let's go find Matt.

07:43.171 --> 07:47.170
All right, number seven.
It's on the corner there.

07:47.250 --> 07:49.251
Any idea where
I might find Mayor Wando?

07:49.291 --> 07:52.850
She should be right around the corner,
accepting some award.

07:52.930 --> 07:56.090
Dante's Peak was just named the best...
well, the second-best place to live...

07:56.130 --> 07:58.410
in the United States,
population under 20,000.

07:58.490 --> 08:01.049
- Good for you. What was number one?
- I don't know.

08:01.129 --> 08:03.889
Some piece of crap town
out in Montana. Who cares?

08:03.969 --> 08:07.568
- I'll be seeing ya.
- Okay.

08:07.608 --> 08:13.167
I'd like to thank Karen from
Money magazine for this wonderful award.

08:13.247 --> 08:15.807
It's... Oh, what is it?

08:15.887 --> 08:18.448
Lauren, is it
Karen or Kathy?

08:18.528 --> 08:21.807
It's Karen, Mom.
Karen, for the tenth time.

08:21.887 --> 08:24.286
Karen.
And you're gonna be late.

08:24.366 --> 08:26.806
- Have you seen my good jacket?
- You don't have a good jacket.

08:26.885 --> 08:30.765
- Honey, the blue one.
- Oh, it's on the chair in the kitchen.

08:30.845 --> 08:34.405
Okay.
Graham, it's time to go!

08:34.486 --> 08:36.765
- Where's your brother?
- He's gonna meet us there.

08:36.804 --> 08:39.524
- There's your jacket.
- Okay.

08:40.563 --> 08:42.524
Let's go, Mom.
You'll be late.

08:48.723 --> 08:51.442
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Whoo!

08:51.522 --> 08:53.643
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Whoo!

08:57.042 --> 09:00.281
Folks, uh, we're real sorry
for the delay.

09:00.321 --> 09:04.081
We're gonna get started
in just one moment. Any moment now.

09:04.161 --> 09:08.520
Les, we've been waitin' half an hour!

09:15.200 --> 09:18.320
- Go find a place in the front, okay?
- Okay.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.359
- Hey, Bill.
- Hey, Rachel.

09:20.439 --> 09:22.399
Oh, thank God. Ladies and gentlemen,

09:22.439 --> 09:25.798
I'd like to introduce the mayor
of Dante's Peak, Rachel Wando.

09:26.878 --> 09:29.517
It's about time.

09:30.918 --> 09:33.718
Ladies and gentlemen...
Ladies and gentlemen.

09:33.798 --> 09:36.917
This is a very special day
in Dante's Peak.

09:36.997 --> 09:41.316
To kick off, I would like to introduce
Karen Narlington of Money magazine.

09:43.995 --> 09:47.236
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Les.

09:47.316 --> 09:50.875
Mayor Wando, it gives me great pleasure
to present to you...

09:50.955 --> 09:53.275
a Money magazine award.

09:53.355 --> 09:56.074
Dante's Peak,
the second most desirable place...

09:56.154 --> 09:59.595
to live in the United States,
population under 20,000.

09:59.675 --> 10:02.234
Congratulations.

10:09.552 --> 10:11.832
Thank you...

10:11.912 --> 10:16.072
- It's Karen!
- Thank you, Karen. Thank you, Lauren.

10:16.152 --> 10:20.071
This award means a lot to us.

10:20.151 --> 10:22.391
We've been proud of our town
for a long time.

10:22.471 --> 10:25.110
It's beautiful.
It's safe.

10:25.190 --> 10:27.550
It's a wonderful place
in which to raise a family.

10:27.630 --> 10:31.751
And now with the prospect of a major
investment in our economic future...

10:31.791 --> 10:34.190
by Mr. Elliot Blair
of Blair Industries...

10:34.270 --> 10:36.949
Will you stand up,
Elliot?

10:37.029 --> 10:39.509
Next year we're
gonna be number one.

10:39.709 --> 10:41.948
Whoo! You're gonna love this.

10:42.028 --> 10:43.949
Come on in.
It's great.

10:44.029 --> 10:45.948
- Is it really warm?
- Oh, it's beautiful.

10:50.028 --> 10:51.268
Yeah!

10:51.388 --> 10:55.187
Oh. Ow. It's really hot.

10:55.267 --> 10:59.267
Yeah, well, I think that's
why they call it Twonset Hot Springs.

10:59.347 --> 11:01.946
Hey!

11:02.026 --> 11:06.065
- So, is this great or what?
- Mmm, sure beats the hell out of L.A.

11:06.145 --> 11:09.025
Yes, it does.
Maybe we should move here.

11:09.065 --> 11:12.146
I don't think so.
I'd go nuts in a week.

11:15.545 --> 11:20.623
It's nothing.
Some animal must have scared them.

11:20.703 --> 11:22.943
- Jerry?
- What the hell was that?

11:23.023 --> 11:25.983
Oh, my God!

11:26.063 --> 11:30.823
So everybody get out there, have a
great time and enjoy this beautiful day.

11:35.022 --> 11:37.221
- Good job, Mom.
- Where is your brother?

11:37.261 --> 11:39.221
- I don't know.
- I know where he is.

11:39.261 --> 11:43.421
Mayor Wando? Hi. Harry Dalton
with the U.S. Geological Survey...

11:43.501 --> 11:45.420
- Wonderful speech, Rachel.
- Excuse me, Mayor Wando, gentlemen.

11:45.500 --> 11:48.700
- I'm sorry. You are?
- Harry Dalton.

11:48.780 --> 11:52.739
Oh, from Portland. Yes, your boss called
and said you were coming.

11:52.779 --> 11:54.900
- Elliot, can I call you later?
- Sure.

11:54.940 --> 11:57.059
And that I should show you
around. Is that right?

11:57.179 --> 12:01.698
- Is this a good time?
- Uh, yeah.

12:01.858 --> 12:05.137
Just have to make
a quick stop.

12:05.177 --> 12:07.498
Sure.
That's okay.

12:12.178 --> 12:14.897
- Um, what are we doing here?
- This will only take a second.

12:17.416 --> 12:21.335
So, you have any kids?

12:21.415 --> 12:23.335
Mmm, nope.
I don't.

12:23.415 --> 12:25.695
You're lucky.
Right, Mom?

12:25.775 --> 12:29.535
Oh, no, honey.
Sometimes having kids is just wonderful.

12:29.615 --> 12:33.294
And sometimes...

12:33.374 --> 12:36.654
Graham!

12:36.734 --> 12:40.254
My brother Graham?
He's in a lot of trouble.

12:40.334 --> 12:43.733
- Mm-hmm. Yes, I think he is.
- Graham?

12:43.813 --> 12:46.053
- Graham!
- You get in trouble?

12:46.133 --> 12:48.053
- No.
- Of course not.

12:48.133 --> 12:51.692
- Graham!
- I'm coming!

12:55.252 --> 13:00.171
Get in the car. You boys, go home.
You should know better.

13:00.251 --> 13:03.050
See ya, guys.

13:03.130 --> 13:06.210
I don't know
what's wrong with you.

13:06.290 --> 13:10.650
- Can't we do this some other time?
- The mine is dangerous.

13:10.730 --> 13:12.650
- It's off-limits.
- Whatever.

13:12.730 --> 13:14.169
Trouble...

13:14.209 --> 13:18.408
- Let's cross the street, man.
- All right.

13:19.488 --> 13:22.088
- Hey, Rachel. Hey!
- Hey, Jane.

13:22.168 --> 13:25.169
- I heard Mrs. Mackey was sick.
- Just a touch of the flu.

13:25.249 --> 13:28.408
- And how are you?
- Dr. Fox, this is...

13:28.488 --> 13:31.327
Harry Dalton of the
United States Geological Survey.

13:31.407 --> 13:33.327
- Oh, hey.
- How do you do?

13:33.407 --> 13:35.646
- Nice meeting you.
- Bye, Jane.

13:35.686 --> 13:38.446
Bye.

13:44.526 --> 13:48.765
- Wanna see?
- It looks like black licorice.

13:48.845 --> 13:51.925
Can I see it?

13:52.005 --> 13:55.404
- Hmm. You know what this is?
- Uh-uh.

13:55.484 --> 13:59.963
This is a smoky quartz crystal. I had
one just like it when I was your age.

14:00.043 --> 14:03.123
- Very lucky.
- You know about this stuff?

14:03.203 --> 14:06.803
- Yeah, just a little bit.
- Dr. Dalton is a geologist.

14:06.883 --> 14:08.643
Volcanologist actually.

14:08.723 --> 14:11.522
- You mean like Dr. Spock?
- Mr. Spock.

14:11.602 --> 14:15.281
Well, kind of, but without
the ears. You know, the...

14:15.321 --> 14:17.521
- Drop me off at Grandma's.
- Yeah, me too.

14:17.601 --> 14:19.880
- You're not tagging along.
- Stop fighting. No.

14:19.961 --> 14:22.641
No one...
No one's going!

14:22.721 --> 14:24.761
Dr. Dalton has been
patient enough.

14:24.841 --> 14:26.800
It's okay if you want to drop
the kids off at your mother's.

14:26.840 --> 14:29.200
She's not my mother.
She's my mother-in-law.

14:29.240 --> 14:31.319
Or my ex-mother-in-law.

14:42.478 --> 14:44.478
My, my.

14:44.558 --> 14:46.877
This is beautiful.

14:46.917 --> 14:48.877
- Grandma!
- Grandma!

14:48.917 --> 14:52.477
- Well, look who's here! How ya doin'?
- Good.

14:52.557 --> 14:54.876
- Keepin' outta trouble?
- Yeah.

14:54.956 --> 14:58.236
- Oh, Lauren, my ladybug.
- Hello, Ruth.

14:58.316 --> 15:02.595
- Hey, Roughy. How ya doin', girl?
- Hi, Rachel.

15:02.675 --> 15:04.556
You Rachel's boyfriend?

15:04.636 --> 15:09.435
Uh, no, no.
Harry Dalton,

15:09.475 --> 15:11.714
United States
Geological Survey.

15:11.794 --> 15:14.034
Just up here to check on your mountain.
That's all.

15:14.074 --> 15:18.074
Bunch of you people came up here
right after Mount St. Helens went nuts.

15:18.154 --> 15:21.434
There was nothing going on then.
There's nothing going on here now.

15:21.514 --> 15:24.473
- Yes, well, um...
- I need to take Dr. Dalton up to the high lake...

15:24.513 --> 15:26.712
and wondered if the kids
could stay here a while.

15:26.752 --> 15:30.192
Sure. But why don't we all go?
We can go swimming.

15:30.272 --> 15:33.312
Mess around in the hot springs
on the way back.

15:33.392 --> 15:36.831
- Yeah, our swim stuff's in the truck.
- I'll get mine.

15:46.949 --> 15:48.950
Come on, girl.
Come on.

15:49.030 --> 15:51.029
Okay. Come on.

16:01.949 --> 16:04.708
Oh, ho!

16:04.788 --> 16:10.187
- What are you doing there?
- Checking the acidity in the water.

16:10.267 --> 16:14.986
- Oh, like a pool man.
- Yeah, exactly. Just like a pool man.

16:18.547 --> 16:20.466
We'll, uh...

16:20.546 --> 16:23.026
We'll take
these pH readings...

16:23.066 --> 16:26.705
and check them against the ones
we did about 15 years ago.

16:26.785 --> 16:29.944
- Where? From here?
- Uh-huh. And on Mount St. Helens.

16:30.024 --> 16:34.104
Those trees over there.
Any idea when they died?

16:34.184 --> 16:37.263
No. Maybe from
the winter storms.

16:37.383 --> 16:40.183
Why? Think we got
a problem?

16:40.263 --> 16:42.263
No. No, I don't think so.

16:42.343 --> 16:45.583
I do about
25, 30 of these a year.

16:45.663 --> 16:49.062
Ninety-eight percent of the time
they're just false alarms.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.461
And the other two percent?

16:51.541 --> 16:56.140
You wouldn't have to worry about moving
up on that "best places to live" list.

17:07.339 --> 17:10.259
- Come on, girl!
- You guys be careful!

17:10.339 --> 17:15.259
Watch out for poison oak
when you put your swimsuits on.

17:15.339 --> 17:18.939
They'll be fine.
Hey, wait up!

17:55.013 --> 18:00.133
A man who stares at a rock
must have a lot on his mind. Or nothing.

18:02.933 --> 18:07.212
Well, these old rocks here give us some
idea of when this area was last active.

18:07.292 --> 18:10.371
- Yeah? When was that?
- Oh, about 7,000 years ago.

18:10.451 --> 18:12.691
Give us a smile.

18:12.731 --> 18:15.212
Beautiful.

18:15.292 --> 18:18.131
Take it easy now, okay?

18:18.211 --> 18:22.330
- Ooh, don't touch it.
- Roughy, no. Stop.

18:22.370 --> 18:25.569
What? What is it?

18:25.609 --> 18:28.369
We found two
dead squirrels, Mom.

18:28.449 --> 18:32.289
- That's what this fuss was all about?
- Don't touch them.

18:32.368 --> 18:34.729
Must be some sort of
squirrel epidemic.

18:34.809 --> 18:36.808
Oh, God.

18:36.888 --> 18:40.288
They're dropping like that
all over the mountain.

18:40.328 --> 18:42.328
Come on. Let's go.

18:48.726 --> 18:52.565
Phew. It stinks.
I don't know if I wanna go in.

18:52.645 --> 18:56.127
It smells like your room.
You go in there.

18:56.167 --> 18:59.566
Hey, Grandma.
Somebody left their clothes here.

18:59.646 --> 19:03.325
Sometimes couples
sneak up here for a hot dip.

19:03.405 --> 19:07.924
- And some hot nooky.
- Ruth, for God's sake.

19:14.364 --> 19:16.963
Lauren, move.
Lauren, get out of the way.

19:18.843 --> 19:21.882
Watch me, Mom.

19:21.962 --> 19:24.322
Graham, no, no!
No, no, no! No. Stop. Stop.

19:28.282 --> 19:30.321
Don't look, pal.

19:32.522 --> 19:35.001
Paul, I think we should
monitor the entire area.

19:35.081 --> 19:38.160
Get the whole shooting match
in here.

19:38.240 --> 19:43.080
I don't know, but the acidity
in the lake is high enough to bother me.

19:43.160 --> 19:47.519
There's enough carbon dioxide coming out
of the soil to start killing trees and wildlife...

19:47.599 --> 19:52.119
Paul. Paul, you sent me
up here to check. I'm doing that.

19:52.199 --> 19:55.839
I think attention
should be paid.

19:55.919 --> 19:58.838
All right.
I'll call you.

19:58.918 --> 20:01.597
- You guys okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

20:01.677 --> 20:03.597
- Bye, Mom.
- I love you.

20:03.677 --> 20:06.436
I love you, Mom.

20:06.516 --> 20:08.917
I don't think
I'll be too late, Ruth.

20:08.997 --> 20:11.717
- Bye!
- Bye.

20:11.797 --> 20:14.556
- You okay?
- Yeah.

20:15.636 --> 20:17.795
Any idea who they were?

20:17.875 --> 20:23.395
No. Never seen them before.
Backpackers maybe.

20:23.475 --> 20:27.794
- What's going on here, Harry?
- I don't know.

20:27.874 --> 20:31.434
- How big of a problem do we have?
- It's too early to tell.

20:31.514 --> 20:33.953
I think you should call
a city council meeting.

20:33.993 --> 20:35.993
- Ready to roll?
- Yep.

20:36.313 --> 20:39.313
I thought this was supposed
to be an extinct volcano.

20:39.393 --> 20:43.112
Not extinct.
Just dormant...

20:43.192 --> 20:45.392
as in sleeping.

20:45.472 --> 20:47.911
And your volcano
might just be waking up.

20:47.991 --> 20:52.512
You're talking
about the evacuation of 7,400 people.

20:52.592 --> 20:55.191
- You don't think that's extreme?
- All I'm talking about...

20:55.271 --> 21:00.470
is you consider alerting the town
to the possibility of an evacuation.

21:00.510 --> 21:02.509
What Mr. Dalton here
doesn't realize...

21:02.549 --> 21:06.148
is that if Elliot Blair gets the idea
there is some kind of problem here,

21:06.228 --> 21:10.229
he's gonna take his $18 million,
his 800 jobs, and he's gonna evacuate.

21:10.309 --> 21:12.309
Les, two people are dead,
and we don't know...

21:12.389 --> 21:15.188
This is the first time in 40 years
that we have the opportunity...

21:15.268 --> 21:17.827
Look, look!

21:17.907 --> 21:22.387
It's been a very long day.
Let's try to treat each other nicely.

21:22.467 --> 21:25.986
Norman, why don't you pull out
the town's emergency evacuation plans.

21:26.066 --> 21:28.067
We should at least
have a look at them.

21:28.147 --> 21:31.026
If I can find them.

21:47.303 --> 21:50.344
Look at this nice little town.

21:50.424 --> 21:53.544
Nestled all snug and cozy
right against the mountain.

21:53.624 --> 21:57.823
- Yeah, just like Pompeii.
- Come on. Let's unpack her.

21:57.903 --> 22:01.662
All right.
The conference room ought to be...

22:01.742 --> 22:03.621
big enough for you
to set up shop in.

22:03.661 --> 22:05.742
Thanks. Do you know where
I can find Harry Dalton?

22:05.822 --> 22:08.822
- I expected to see him here.
- He's over at the city council chambers.

22:08.902 --> 22:10.901
He and the mayor
called a meeting.

22:10.981 --> 22:14.460
Okay.

22:14.540 --> 22:16.980
When is this mountain
likely to blow up?

22:17.060 --> 22:21.140
I wish predicting volcanic eruptions
were an exact science. Unfortunately...

22:21.180 --> 22:24.779
Oh, perfect. So we put the town
on notice, and then nothing happens.

22:24.859 --> 22:28.539
People, we're not the only town
in this state.

22:28.619 --> 22:30.858
All right, so are we ready
to put it to vote?

22:30.938 --> 22:33.779
I don't know if we have
enough information.

22:33.859 --> 22:35.778
Paul.

22:35.858 --> 22:39.297
Everybody, this is my boss
Dr. Paul Dreyfus.

22:39.377 --> 22:41.297
- Mayor Wando.
- Hi. Rachel.

22:41.377 --> 22:44.456
It's a pleasure indeed.
Uh, what's going on here?

22:44.536 --> 22:48.697
I've recommended to the council members
they put this town on alert.

22:48.737 --> 22:51.496
They were just about
to vote on it.

22:51.576 --> 22:54.496
- Can I have a word with you outside?
- Sure.

22:54.576 --> 22:57.535
Excuse us.

22:57.615 --> 23:01.214
- Who the hell is this guy?
- I sent you here to look around,

23:01.294 --> 23:04.174
not to scare the hell
out of the city council.

23:04.254 --> 23:08.414
But two people are dead. Recommending an
alert seemed the only responsible thing to do.

23:08.494 --> 23:13.213
There are dozens of reasons that would
account for what happened there.

23:13.293 --> 23:17.773
Anything from a mild earthquake
to a slight seismic shift.

23:17.853 --> 23:22.092
Not one of them means the mountain's
gonna blow up next week or next month...

23:22.132 --> 23:27.171
...or the next hundred years.
- The whole spirit of the town was on its way up.

23:27.251 --> 23:29.331
Just thinks he can walk in here...

23:29.411 --> 23:33.371
Ladies and gentlemen, I am sure
Dr. Dalton was doing...

23:33.411 --> 23:35.570
what he thought was
in your town's best interests.

23:35.650 --> 23:38.610
However, I have learned
through bitter experience...

23:38.650 --> 23:42.849
that these decisions
are not to be made lightly.

23:42.929 --> 23:46.890
Back in 1980, I would have
bet you a million bucks...

23:46.930 --> 23:48.889
that Mammoth Mountain
was about to go up.

23:48.929 --> 23:54.688
We began to talk about the possibility
of putting that town on alert.

23:54.768 --> 23:57.007
Thank God the mountain didn't go up,

23:57.087 --> 23:59.007
but the damage had already been done.

23:59.087 --> 24:02.647
The word leaked out that the
U.S.G.S. had expressed concern.

24:02.727 --> 24:06.567
So the tourists panicked
and stayed away.

24:06.607 --> 24:10.606
The real estate values plummeted,
and the town nearly went bankrupt.

24:10.686 --> 24:13.685
Consequently, I'm now
a lot more cautious...

24:13.765 --> 24:17.125
when it comes to even talking
about putting a town on alert.

24:17.205 --> 24:19.125
Now, folks,
understand something.

24:19.205 --> 24:22.685
We are gonna be camped out here
for as long as it takes...

24:22.765 --> 24:27.124
with seismometers and tiltmeters
that are gonna measure and monitor...

24:27.204 --> 24:29.403
every little hiccup
that the mountain makes.

24:29.484 --> 24:32.483
We'll be bouncing laser beams off it
to track any changes in size.

24:32.563 --> 24:35.802
We'll be analyzing
gas emissions.

24:35.882 --> 24:39.522
We've got a robot that's gonna stroll
up there and take its temperature.

24:39.602 --> 24:43.801
Now, believe me, I'm not trying
to make light of your concerns.

24:43.881 --> 24:48.641
But I want you to understand
if the time comes to call for an alert...

24:48.721 --> 24:53.680
If the time comes, it will be based
upon scientific evidence...

24:53.720 --> 24:59.000
and not upon anyone's opinion.

24:59.080 --> 25:02.360
For God's sake, Rachel,
this thing...

25:02.440 --> 25:05.159
should have been handled
much more discreetly.

25:05.239 --> 25:07.519
- This meeting never should have been called.
- Harry.

25:07.559 --> 25:11.398
I just hope our Mr. Blair
didn't get wind of this.

25:11.478 --> 25:15.678
You're making a big mistake, Paul.
This is an unstable system.

25:15.758 --> 25:17.677
This town should be on alert.

25:17.757 --> 25:20.837
You need a vacation.
I'll see you in two weeks.

25:20.917 --> 25:25.636
We got some serious
damage control to do.

25:25.716 --> 25:30.116
If they get scared off, Rachel,
you're the one's responsible.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.355
Any questions?
I'll be happy to answer them.

26:24.109 --> 26:27.309
- How about a nice adult beverage?
- Excellent.

26:27.389 --> 26:29.828
Sounds good to me.

26:33.387 --> 26:36.027
Give me just a minute here.

26:36.067 --> 26:41.027
Thought you'd be off
on your fishin' vacation by now.

26:41.107 --> 26:45.306
- Decided to stick around.
- I can see that. Question is, why?

26:45.346 --> 26:47.346
'Cause this town's in trouble.

26:47.386 --> 26:50.185
I'm the best man you got.

26:50.265 --> 26:52.385
Whiskey.

26:55.865 --> 26:58.585
You are the best man I've got.

26:58.625 --> 27:03.184
But until you can get it in your
head there are politics involved...

27:03.224 --> 27:05.903
delicate politics,
not to mention economics,

27:05.983 --> 27:09.343
you're only gonna do these people
more harm than good.

27:09.423 --> 27:11.423
- I understand.
- There ya are.

27:11.503 --> 27:14.902
Tomorrow morning,
I'm gonna hire a helicopter,

27:14.982 --> 27:19.702
fly around the mountain,
see how much sulfur dioxide is there.

27:19.782 --> 27:22.701
- Okay.
- From now on everything comes from me.

27:22.741 --> 27:27.101
Any more town meetings to be called,
I'll be the one to call them.

27:27.181 --> 27:29.420
Okay?

27:30.500 --> 27:32.420
Okay.

27:47.458 --> 27:50.057
Got the keys, hon?

27:50.097 --> 27:52.537
Yep.

27:55.218 --> 27:58.897
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

27:59.977 --> 28:01.976
- Coffee?
- Uh, yeah. Please.

28:02.056 --> 28:04.936
Cappuccino, espresso,
cafe latte?

28:05.016 --> 28:06.935
Could I just have
a regular coffee?

28:07.015 --> 28:09.216
Sure.

28:10.375 --> 28:13.015
I heard you left town
last night.

28:13.055 --> 28:16.935
Uh, yes. Well, I decided to stay. See
what new trouble I can get myself into.

28:17.015 --> 28:20.894
- So, what's good here?
- Everything's good here.

28:20.974 --> 28:24.614
- Aah!
- Oh! My God. I am so sorry.

28:24.694 --> 28:27.413
It's okay.
It's all right.

28:27.493 --> 28:31.732
I suppose I had that coming for screwing
up your reelection chances, eh?

28:31.812 --> 28:34.132
I didn't do it on purpose.

28:34.212 --> 28:39.172
I've always been better at figuring out
volcanoes than people and politics.

28:39.212 --> 28:44.251
Anyway, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble.

28:44.331 --> 28:49.250
And, uh...
I just wanted to help.

28:49.330 --> 28:51.330
You like
eggplant parmigiana?

28:51.410 --> 28:54.210
For breakfast?

28:54.290 --> 28:56.650
- For dinner.
- Oh.

28:56.690 --> 29:00.809
I'm inviting you
over for dinner to say thank you.

29:00.889 --> 29:02.888
Thanking me for what?

29:02.928 --> 29:06.608
For saving Graham's life...

29:06.688 --> 29:08.608
and for caring.

29:11.407 --> 29:13.368
It's a date.

29:37.925 --> 29:42.364
Okay, let's go down lower and
head for that rock formation over there.

29:42.403 --> 29:44.923
If I fly during my lunch break,
I get overtime.

29:45.003 --> 29:47.642
Just do it.

30:17.319 --> 30:19.839
All right,
let's just hover here.

30:23.958 --> 30:26.438
What you got back there?
How's it lookin'?

30:26.518 --> 30:30.438
Minimal sulfur dioxide emissions.
There's nothing to worry about.

30:32.518 --> 30:35.637
We're green
across the board.

30:35.717 --> 30:41.036
There's nothing to indicate there's
any kind of activity here. She's quiet.

30:41.116 --> 30:43.915
Yeah.

30:43.955 --> 30:46.115
She's quiet.

30:55.594 --> 30:58.394
Okay.
Which hand is the domino in?

30:58.434 --> 31:01.193
- That one.
- You've got it. Thank you very much.

31:01.274 --> 31:03.153
- Right here?
- Yes.

31:03.233 --> 31:06.713
- Looks like a squished heart.
- More like an appendix to me.

31:06.793 --> 31:08.753
- Cool.
- Can you do any other tricks?

31:08.833 --> 31:12.112
- Uh...
- Maybe Harry's tired.

31:12.192 --> 31:15.391
Just one more.
Here you go.

31:15.471 --> 31:17.712
All right. Look at that.
No boogers,

31:17.752 --> 31:21.111
but right down the middle
we have a little sewing needle.

31:21.191 --> 31:24.550
You see it? Now, that's magic,
and it needs a magic hair.

31:24.630 --> 31:29.070
This won't hurt.
Mmm, yummy.

31:29.150 --> 31:32.790
Okay, hold this, please.
Thank you. Let me put my glasses on.

31:32.870 --> 31:35.629
And... here we go...

31:35.709 --> 31:38.029
like this,
thread it through.

31:38.069 --> 31:40.188
Fine. You hold that.

31:40.268 --> 31:44.347
Okay. Mm-hmm. Look there.

31:44.427 --> 31:47.588
- Eww!
- Ah, much better. There we go.

31:47.668 --> 31:50.188
And we go like this.

31:50.268 --> 31:54.347
All right.
And go like that.

31:54.427 --> 31:56.786
It really works.

31:56.866 --> 31:59.146
Whoa.

31:59.186 --> 32:01.146
It's magic.

32:01.186 --> 32:04.785
I know it's just a little town,

32:04.865 --> 32:07.785
but I couldn't imagine
living anywhere else.

32:07.825 --> 32:12.224
I grew up here.
I went to school here.

32:12.264 --> 32:15.065
Got married here?

32:15.145 --> 32:18.784
Yeah. Brian.

32:19.863 --> 32:24.622
We were just kids.

32:24.702 --> 32:29.063
Haven't heard from him
in quite a while.

32:29.143 --> 32:33.302
Quite a while.
Try six years.

32:33.382 --> 32:35.302
Hmm.

32:35.382 --> 32:39.661
I don't think she'd admit it, but I
don't even think Ruth knows where he is.

32:39.741 --> 32:43.181
You seem to be doing okay.

32:43.261 --> 32:47.661
Yeah. It was hard at first.
Hard for the kids.

32:47.741 --> 32:51.340
But we're okay.

32:52.419 --> 32:54.579
How about you?

32:54.659 --> 32:57.018
You ever been married?

32:57.098 --> 33:00.698
No. Never.

33:00.738 --> 33:03.738
Why not?

33:03.778 --> 33:06.178
Well, for one thing,
I move around a lot.

33:06.258 --> 33:10.137
Colombia, Guatemala,
the Philippines,

33:10.177 --> 33:13.977
Mexico, New Zealand,
New Guinea.

33:14.057 --> 33:17.376
Wherever there's a volcano
with an attitude.

33:17.416 --> 33:21.775
Makes it hard
to settle down.

33:21.855 --> 33:24.376
You ever come close?

33:25.655 --> 33:29.255
Yes. Once.

33:32.335 --> 33:34.294
Touchy subject.

33:40.133 --> 33:43.133
Her name was Marianne.

33:43.213 --> 33:45.533
We worked together.

33:46.613 --> 33:50.972
She loved volcanoes.
Fascinated by them.

33:51.012 --> 33:54.211
Loved the life.

33:55.772 --> 34:00.651
Four years ago,
a volcano erupted in Columbia.

34:00.691 --> 34:04.651
Marianne and I thought
we had enough time to get out.

34:04.691 --> 34:07.290
Unfortunately, we were wrong.

34:07.370 --> 34:11.090
We got too close to the show.

34:12.929 --> 34:14.969
Marianne was killed.

34:19.128 --> 34:21.967
If this thing blows,

34:22.007 --> 34:24.928
and if she does
a Mount St. Helens,

34:25.007 --> 34:29.327
the blast will get here
within a minute.

34:31.447 --> 34:36.206
Well, I hope you're wrong
about our volcano, Harry.

34:36.286 --> 34:39.326
But if not,
I'm glad you're here.

34:43.926 --> 34:47.125
Hi, Harry.

34:47.205 --> 34:51.244
Hello. Hello, Harry.

35:00.483 --> 35:02.963
I found five seismometers, Paul.
Where's the other three?

35:03.043 --> 35:05.762
In the back of the van.

35:05.842 --> 35:08.443
Good morning. Hi.
Hello.

35:08.523 --> 35:10.602
Hi. Hello.
How are you?

35:10.682 --> 35:13.641
Uh, everyone, this is, uh,
Rachel Wando, mayor of the town.

35:13.721 --> 35:16.121
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:16.161 --> 35:18.160
Thought maybe you guys
could use some coffee.

35:18.240 --> 35:21.840
Not knowing what you like, I brought
cappuccinos, except for regular for you.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.921
- Perfect. Thank you.
- Great.

35:23.961 --> 35:26.200
I am jonesing.
I could really use a good fix.

35:26.280 --> 35:28.680
- What kind of coffee machine do you use?
- Gaggia.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.999
- Where do you get your beans?
- So?

35:31.079 --> 35:33.359
- So?
- So?

35:33.439 --> 35:35.838
You probably keep your beans
in the freezer, right?

35:35.878 --> 35:39.439
Oh, no. Never keep your beans in
the freezer. Takes all the oils out.

35:39.519 --> 35:43.198
This town just
might be worth saving.

35:43.278 --> 35:45.677
Mmm! Good coffee!
That's good.

35:53.397 --> 35:57.795
Nice woman, that Rachel.
Best-looking mayor I've ever seen.

35:57.875 --> 36:00.356
- She's got my vote.
- Mm-hmm. Twice.

36:00.396 --> 36:04.715
All right, guys. Here you go.
That ought to do it.

36:04.795 --> 36:07.475
Okay, Harry.

36:07.555 --> 36:12.834
Bingo. If this mountain's gonna rock
and roll, we're gonna know about it.

36:12.914 --> 36:14.993
So how was dinner
last night, Harry?

36:15.073 --> 36:20.914
Terry, why don't you just give it a
break and stop trying to fix me up, eh?

36:20.994 --> 36:24.033
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I have great taste in
women. When have I steered you wrong?

36:24.113 --> 36:28.552
Yeah? What about Astrid?

36:28.632 --> 36:31.031
What about Astrid? I thought the two
of you would have a lot in common.

36:31.111 --> 36:33.351
- She said she was into rocks.
- Crystals, Terry.

36:33.431 --> 36:37.992
Crystals. Not rocks.
Crystals.

36:38.191 --> 36:41.711
Okay, one, two, three.
There you go.

36:41.791 --> 36:45.150
Watch your foot.
Watch your foot. Okay.

36:45.190 --> 36:48.229
All right. Good.
I'm gonna get my breakfast.

36:48.309 --> 36:50.349
You gettin' the hang
of this thing?

36:50.429 --> 36:54.269
It's still kind of goosey,
but I think I'm gettin' it.

36:54.348 --> 36:57.869
Yes! It's coffee time!
Coffee. Coffee, coffee, coffee.

36:57.949 --> 37:02.228
Cappuccino! Java! Yes!

37:02.308 --> 37:04.148
- How are you?
- Coffee. Thank you.

37:04.228 --> 37:07.947
- Decaf, nonfat, no sugar.
- Thanks.

37:08.027 --> 37:10.107
- Macchiato.
- Thank you.

37:10.187 --> 37:13.266
- Double espresso.
- Here! Ah, thank you.

37:13.346 --> 37:15.825
Oh, thank you so much.

37:15.905 --> 37:17.866
So how's it looking?

37:17.946 --> 37:23.105
- We've been recording between 25 and 75 earthquakes per day.
- You're kidding?

37:23.185 --> 37:25.825
Don't worry. They're microquakes.
They happen all the time.

37:25.905 --> 37:30.623
Oh. Well. Good.
And what's this?

37:30.703 --> 37:32.863
This little puppy's
called Spider Legs.

37:32.943 --> 37:36.264
She goes in when it's too dangerous
for us. Boldly goes, I might add.

37:36.344 --> 37:40.143
Actually, we'll take
gas readings up front.

37:40.223 --> 37:43.822
And then, we'll send video back here
to home base. Hopefully.

37:46.142 --> 37:51.581
Good. Now, try to keep
the weight on that one.

37:51.621 --> 37:54.301
- See what I'm saying? Keep the weight on this...
- That's not me.

37:54.381 --> 37:59.700
- It's not in here.
- The other one isn't moving?

38:02.261 --> 38:05.620
What's the problem now?

38:05.700 --> 38:10.939
- There's no problem.
- If this thing keeps screwing up, I don't want to take it up.

38:10.978 --> 38:13.618
Paul, the problem is E.L.F. here.

38:13.698 --> 38:16.338
All right, look, I'm gonna
fix this once and for all.

38:16.378 --> 38:19.378
Everybody, turn around.
Turn around.

38:23.577 --> 38:28.016
Just be sure to put the damn thing
back on before NASA finds out.

38:28.056 --> 38:30.056
It'll be
our little secret.

38:30.096 --> 38:32.256
So what do you say, big guy?
Ready to see the sights, huh?

38:32.336 --> 38:34.817
Oh, yeah. Big boy's ready. Big boy's
definitely ready to see the sights.

38:34.897 --> 38:37.696
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

38:37.776 --> 38:41.535
- Come on, Terry. Time to take your medication.
- Ah, thank you.

38:50.774 --> 38:54.174
You guys see this?
Do you see this?

38:54.254 --> 38:57.413
I expect apologies and six-packs
from each one of ya.

38:57.493 --> 39:00.253
Ya lookin' for a medal because
you finally got the thing to work okay?

39:00.333 --> 39:03.692
"Okay," Paul? "Okay"?
It's working beautifully.

39:03.772 --> 39:07.851
It ought to be workin' better.
It lost 15 pounds of ugly fat.

39:07.931 --> 39:10.611
- Zoom into the left.
- Zooming in.

39:10.691 --> 39:15.412
We got some minor geothermal activity
on the edge of the crater.

39:15.492 --> 39:20.130
Pan to the right a little.
I wanna look at the lava domes.

39:20.170 --> 39:24.769
Look at it.

39:24.849 --> 39:27.449
- Oops.
- Ah.

39:27.529 --> 39:32.169
Terry's masterpiece
is a piece of junk.

39:32.249 --> 39:35.609
Show me the leg
that isn't workin'.

39:35.649 --> 39:39.648
- Houston, we have a problem.
- We copy. You have a problem.

39:39.728 --> 39:42.007
Why not just throw rocks
at the goddamn thing?

39:42.087 --> 39:45.567
I'm gonna go down there
and give it the personal touch.

39:45.647 --> 39:48.086
Well...

39:48.126 --> 39:52.286
- Well, here we go again.
- Real easy, okay?

39:52.366 --> 39:55.246
- Always.
- You got it?

39:59.166 --> 40:02.725
- You all right?
- You got me?

40:02.805 --> 40:05.364
- I got ya.
- Here we go.

40:05.444 --> 40:07.844
No heroics now, okay?

40:07.924 --> 40:11.644
- Paul, Terry's going down. Hear me?
- You're comin' in crystal clear.

40:11.724 --> 40:14.324
Easy.

40:20.402 --> 40:23.042
I- I-I don't think
this is a very smart idea.

40:23.122 --> 40:24.561
- You all right?
- Yeah.

40:29.401 --> 40:34.321
Listen, uh, Terry,
why don't we, uh,

40:34.401 --> 40:37.200
just forget Spider Legs for now,
and you get your backside back up here?

40:37.280 --> 40:39.720
- Okay?
- Not a chance.

40:39.800 --> 40:43.160
For the $450,000
we put into this beast,

40:43.240 --> 40:45.999
it ought to be able
to stand on its head, split the atom...

40:46.079 --> 40:47.999
and fart
"The Star Spangled Banner. "

40:53.918 --> 40:57.478
Almost there.

41:02.077 --> 41:04.037
Hello, you son of a bitch!

41:04.117 --> 41:08.156
That's Terry's answer to everything.
Kick it if it doesn't work.

41:08.196 --> 41:11.877
- Get your ass back up now.
- Not a chance. I'm goin' off rope.

41:11.957 --> 41:15.836
No, no. No, Terry.
That's not a great idea.

41:15.876 --> 41:19.115
- I can get around to the other side.
- Don't go off rope.

41:19.195 --> 41:24.514
I would swear this thing's purposefully
tryin' to piss me off.

41:24.594 --> 41:27.955
You know what, Harry?
It's workin'!

41:34.233 --> 41:39.032
Paul, something's going on.
There's some seismic activity.

41:39.112 --> 41:42.392
All right, here we go.

41:42.432 --> 41:44.592
What do you think, Stan?

41:44.672 --> 41:48.072
They're minor quakes,
but they're right in the middle of it.

41:48.152 --> 41:50.071
Maybe we ought to tell them
to call it a day. Harry.

41:50.151 --> 41:53.950
- Come on! Come on!
- Paul, I didn't get ya. Say it again.

41:54.030 --> 41:56.191
Oh!

41:56.271 --> 42:00.190
- Aah!
- Terry!

42:01.509 --> 42:04.549
Oh, my God!

42:04.629 --> 42:07.189
Terry!

42:09.669 --> 42:14.428
Terry! Talk to me!

42:14.508 --> 42:18.787
- Terry! Can you hear us?
- Terry!

42:18.867 --> 42:20.907
I'm comin' down!

42:20.987 --> 42:24.627
Harry!

42:24.667 --> 42:27.307
Help!

42:27.387 --> 42:29.466
Ow!

42:29.546 --> 42:34.545
- It's okay. It's okay. Where are ya?
- Oh, shit.

42:34.625 --> 42:36.545
It's my leg, man.

42:36.625 --> 42:39.705
- Ow!
- Paul? Paul, come in.

42:39.785 --> 42:44.304
- We can hear you. Go ahead.
- Terry's down. He's got a broken leg.

42:44.384 --> 42:48.304
We need the chopper here really fast.

42:48.384 --> 42:51.343
Copy. Terry's broken his leg.
We're gonna send you a chopper.

42:51.423 --> 42:53.144
Send the chopper now.

42:53.224 --> 42:56.143
I cannot believe the camera's still
working after taking a hit like that.

42:56.223 --> 42:58.942
Come on. Answer the phone.
Come on!

43:04.742 --> 43:09.622
What? Oh! Look. All right.
Hang on a second, okay?

43:09.701 --> 43:13.261
Paul, the son-of-a-bitch pilot
wants to renegotiate his rate.

43:13.341 --> 43:16.340
Give him whatever he wants.

43:21.779 --> 43:26.339
This is rescue chopper. We're comin'
to the rim of the crater now.

43:26.419 --> 43:28.819
Do ya have a visual on us?

43:28.859 --> 43:32.178
We're below ya about
600 feet on the south face!

43:32.258 --> 43:37.618
I see ya. We're gonna go around again
and try to hoist you out.

43:37.698 --> 43:40.657
You got that?

43:43.057 --> 43:47.616
You all right?
We're very, very ready!

43:47.696 --> 43:50.696
He looks in bad shape.

43:57.215 --> 43:59.974
Bring her down!
Come on!

44:03.894 --> 44:06.374
Get it. Get it. Get it.

44:06.454 --> 44:07.734
Way to go.

44:07.814 --> 44:10.213
Hold on!
We're goin' home.

44:10.293 --> 44:11.973
Okay.

44:12.053 --> 44:15.412
- You on?
- Okay! Let her go!

44:17.972 --> 44:22.812
Come on! Go!
Go, go, go! Go! Yes.

44:31.050 --> 44:34.650
- You got 'im?
- Yeah, I got 'im.

44:37.050 --> 44:39.689
- Great job.
- I don't want to talk out of turn.

44:39.769 --> 44:43.529
You should put this town on alert.
There's a lot of activity there.

44:43.609 --> 44:47.768
It was intense up there, but I don't
wanna cause a panic over minor quakes.

44:47.848 --> 44:50.049
- "Minor"?
- The biggest one we measured was 2.9...

44:50.129 --> 44:53.608
I don't give a damn if it was a 1.1.
Those quakes were shallow.

44:53.688 --> 44:56.407
- Damn shallow. I felt them.
- You don't...

44:56.487 --> 44:59.686
They weren't tectonic. They were
magmatic. This thing is gonna blow.

44:59.766 --> 45:02.247
I'm warning you. I'm not gonna have
one of my people scaring everybody...

45:02.327 --> 45:04.567
because of guesswork
and hunches.

45:04.647 --> 45:08.446
Another 48 hours will tell the tale.
You get a grip.

45:11.085 --> 45:14.725
That son of a bitch.

45:14.804 --> 45:17.645
I'm okay.

45:17.685 --> 45:20.885
My doc says I can leave as soon
as they make sure my head's okay.

45:20.965 --> 45:24.284
Okay. See ya in ten years then.

45:24.364 --> 45:26.604
- Ow. Ow.
- I think Spider Legs was just...

45:26.684 --> 45:29.763
getting even with you for all
those kicks in the butt you gave it!

45:29.843 --> 45:32.763
We got
a problem here, guys.

45:32.803 --> 45:35.762
I'm gonna need your help to convince
Paul this mountain means business.

45:35.802 --> 45:39.282
Harry, I hate to agree with
Paul, but there's no evidence...

45:39.362 --> 45:41.482
to suggest there's anything
weird goin' on up there.

45:41.562 --> 45:44.561
- Just like Mount Baker back in the '70s.
- There was no eruption then.

45:44.641 --> 45:49.081
My ninth grade
science teacher once told me...

45:49.161 --> 45:52.160
that if you put a frog in
boiling water, it'll jump out.

45:52.240 --> 45:55.599
But if you put it in cold water
and heat it up gradually,

45:55.679 --> 45:59.959
it'll just sit there
and slowly boil to death.

46:00.039 --> 46:03.120
What's that, Harry?
Your recipe for frog soup?

46:03.200 --> 46:07.278
It's my recipe
for disaster.

46:07.358 --> 46:12.797
If we got here today, we'd know we're in
hot water. We'd put this town on alert.

46:12.877 --> 46:16.397
Look, the seismic activity
is nil. Steady as a rock.

46:16.477 --> 46:19.957
Take a look over here.
A whole lot of nothin'.

46:20.037 --> 46:23.237
It's been like that all week.
There is nothing happening.

46:23.317 --> 46:25.276
There's been
no harmonic tremors.

46:25.316 --> 46:28.275
The tiltmeters don't show any change
in the mountain shape.

46:28.355 --> 46:31.116
I think we've seen all
this big baby's gonna do.

46:31.196 --> 46:34.195
We got the mountain wired.
We got all our equipment in place.

46:34.275 --> 46:39.115
We can keep an eye on things from
home base. Our work here is finished.

46:39.155 --> 46:41.354
We've seen lulls
in activity before.

46:41.434 --> 46:43.434
If we're wise, we'll give it
a couple of days.

46:43.514 --> 46:46.794
I promised you two days.
I gave it a week.

46:46.874 --> 46:51.153
First thing in the morning,
we are outta here.

46:58.152 --> 47:01.272
You know, Rachel, we still have
to have that dinner. Keep the change.

47:01.352 --> 47:04.111
Okay, Elliot.

47:04.191 --> 47:06.231
Order up, Bob.

47:08.110 --> 47:10.470
Great.
Why don't you ask her out?

47:10.550 --> 47:13.790
I lost her number.

47:16.710 --> 47:19.390
Oh, yes! Yes!

47:19.470 --> 47:21.949
That's okay. All right.
What have we got here? Ten bucks?

47:21.989 --> 47:25.228
- That's twenty bucks.
- Twenty bucks.

47:25.308 --> 47:28.188
Twenty bucks.

47:28.228 --> 47:31.188
Come again anytime!
Thanks, Harry.

47:33.667 --> 47:36.827
Give us a beer there,
Charlie.

47:36.907 --> 47:41.826
So, you ever
get to Portland?

47:41.906 --> 47:44.107
No. I'm busy.

47:46.306 --> 47:48.745
Busy?
What do you do for fun?

47:48.785 --> 47:53.744
Fun? Hmph.
What is that? Fun? Oh, I know.

47:53.784 --> 47:58.665
Fun is what you have when you don't have
two children, a business, a town to run.

47:58.745 --> 48:01.664
- Oh, Paul.
- Excuse me, Harry.

48:01.744 --> 48:05.503
Before we took off, I wanted to say
thanks for the hospitality, Mayor Wando.

48:05.583 --> 48:07.983
It was my pleasure.

48:08.063 --> 48:12.103
That's awfully nice of you to say that.
I'm sure you're not sorry to see us go.

48:12.183 --> 48:14.463
Our presence here is
bad for business, right?

48:14.503 --> 48:17.062
I'm gonna go pack.
See ya.

48:17.142 --> 48:20.661
You all right over here?

48:22.061 --> 48:27.141
Well, it's late and I have
to let my baby-sitter get home.

48:27.181 --> 48:30.380
I'll walk you.
Let me get my jacket.

48:30.420 --> 48:32.580
Hey, Harry.
It's your break.

48:32.659 --> 48:35.140
It's your game, guys.

48:39.539 --> 48:43.659
So, when do you
go tomorrow?

48:43.739 --> 48:45.778
Six a. m.

48:45.858 --> 48:48.258
Wish you weren't leaving.

48:48.298 --> 48:52.137
Well, don't worry.
Dreyfus was right.

48:52.217 --> 48:55.258
I guess we don't really
have to be here.

48:55.338 --> 48:59.937
We can watch this mountain
from Portland.

49:00.017 --> 49:02.976
I still wish
you weren't leaving.

49:12.496 --> 49:15.335
Hey, you two!

49:19.094 --> 49:24.294
Jane Fox. That'll give her something
to talk about for a couple of weeks.

49:30.812 --> 49:32.813
- Hi!
- Hi. Are they sleeping?

49:32.893 --> 49:34.812
Yeah, they sure are.

49:34.892 --> 49:36.812
- I'll walk ya out.
- Okay.

49:36.892 --> 49:38.812
- Be right back.
- Okay. Good night.

49:38.892 --> 49:40.972
Good night.

49:45.770 --> 49:48.450
- Okay. You free on Saturday?
- Yes. Saturday's fine.

49:48.530 --> 49:52.610
- Okay. Good. Call ya. Thanks.
- Bye.

49:58.849 --> 50:02.328
Well, maybe I should
make some coffee.

50:02.408 --> 50:06.167
No, Rachel. No.
I don't want any coffee.

50:06.247 --> 50:10.448
I really think I should
make us some coffee.

50:10.528 --> 50:14.607
I don't know
how to tell you this.

50:14.687 --> 50:18.726
But I've never really
cared for your coffee.

50:24.366 --> 50:27.765
Oh.

50:27.845 --> 50:30.805
- Oh.
- Oh.

50:30.885 --> 50:35.124
I, uh, haven't been
with anybody in a long time.

50:35.204 --> 50:39.444
Same here.

50:39.524 --> 50:42.643
But you know what they say.

50:42.723 --> 50:45.563
It's like riding a bicycle.

50:45.603 --> 50:47.482
Once you've learned,
you never forget.

50:47.517 --> 50:49.363
Once you've learned,
you never forget.

50:49.443 --> 50:54.362
Mommy? Mommy?
Is that you?

50:54.442 --> 50:56.802
Yeah, Lauren.
What is it?

50:56.882 --> 51:01.641
- I'm thirsty.
- Okay, honey.

51:01.721 --> 51:04.800
I think she'll go
right back to sleep.

51:04.880 --> 51:09.081
Please, dear God in heaven,
let her go back to sleep.

51:09.161 --> 51:12.960
Ugh. What's wrong
with the water?

51:13.040 --> 51:17.159
- What is it?
- Must be a broken pipe?

51:20.599 --> 51:23.278
- Where's the town's water supply?
- Why?

51:23.358 --> 51:27.998
- Graham. Wake up.
- Go away.

51:32.437 --> 51:35.277
It's right up there.

51:52.895 --> 51:57.574
Ugh. What's that smell?
It smells like sulfur.

51:58.910 --> 52:01.770
Yeah. Ugh!
Sulfur dioxide.

52:01.810 --> 52:06.690
We saw the same thing in the Philippines
on Mount Pinatubo before she blew.

52:06.882 --> 52:11.761
This mountain is a ticking bomb.
Come on. Let's go.

52:24.236 --> 52:26.846
Paul!

52:26.872 --> 52:28.842
I've got that
scientific evidence you need.

52:28.874 --> 52:31.553
Harry, what are you doing?

52:33.011 --> 52:37.650
I've just come from
the town's water supply.

52:39.049 --> 52:40.969
It's the same.

52:41.549 --> 52:43.508
Oh, my God.

52:43.588 --> 52:46.908
The quakes are beginning
to swarm. Got a 2.4.

52:46.948 --> 52:49.669
Gas readings are goin' up too.
It's not good.

52:49.749 --> 52:51.148
Look at this.

52:51.228 --> 52:54.748
Sir, is that the best
you can do for us?

52:54.828 --> 52:58.987
Yes, sir. All right. Thanks very much.
I appreciate it.

52:59.066 --> 53:00.986
The National Guard
cannot be here until tomorrow.

53:01.066 --> 53:02.947
How much time do you think
we've got, Harry?

53:03.026 --> 53:04.947
Don't know.
Too early to tell.

53:05.027 --> 53:09.386
Call the mayor. Have her put the town
on alert. I'll call the F.A.A.

53:09.466 --> 53:11.505
Okay.

53:16.265 --> 53:18.705
Here we go.

53:18.745 --> 53:22.704
In response to the potential
volcanic threat to Dante's Peak,

53:22.744 --> 53:26.544
I am requesting that all residents
attend a meeting at the high school...

53:26.624 --> 53:30.423
at 6:00 p. m. to discuss
the evacuation of our town.

53:30.503 --> 53:33.943
A representative of the United
States Geological Survey...

53:33.983 --> 53:36.902
will be on hand to explain
the facts to you in detail.

53:36.982 --> 53:40.501
When's the mountain gonna blow?

53:40.581 --> 53:42.942
- Tonight? Tomorrow?
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa! Take it easy now.

53:43.022 --> 53:45.862
- They were talking on TV...
- There is no need to be alarmed yet.

53:45.942 --> 53:48.941
- What's this meeting?
- All we want to do is be prepared. Greg.

53:49.021 --> 53:52.500
- Come on, Mr. Cluster.
- I just put up a new sign. I hope nothing happens.

53:52.580 --> 53:55.260
Attention all citizens.
There will be a meeting held...

53:55.340 --> 54:00.939
in the high school at 6:00 p. m. to
discuss the evacuation of Dante's Peak.

54:01.019 --> 54:04.739
To repeat: All citizens are
urged to attend the meeting...

54:04.779 --> 54:07.219
that will be held
in the high school gymnasium...

54:07.379 --> 54:10.098
Ruth, just listen to me
this one time.

54:10.178 --> 54:14.418
Harry says the mountain could blow up
any minute, and you've got to come down.

54:14.498 --> 54:17.217
- That's his opinion.
- Let me try.

54:17.257 --> 54:21.897
Ruth? Hi. Harry Dalton here.
This is a very serious situation.

54:21.977 --> 54:24.056
- You have to consider your family.
- I'm not leaving. That's that.

54:24.136 --> 54:26.856
I understand how you feel, Ruth,
but this...

54:26.936 --> 54:29.576
Hung up.

54:32.055 --> 54:34.455
Stupid, stupid woman.

54:38.174 --> 54:40.653
Come on, Ruth. Pick up.

54:40.733 --> 54:43.375
- We got to go.
- Pick up, Ruth!

54:43.455 --> 54:45.614
She's not coming down,
is she?

54:49.373 --> 54:53.652
Look, if Grandma wants to stay up there,
there's nothing we can do about it.

54:53.692 --> 54:56.451
- But, Mom...
- No buts, Graham. It's her decision.

54:56.531 --> 55:00.612
I need you guys to pack while
we're gone. One suitcase apiece, okay?

55:00.692 --> 55:02.812
Be responsible.
We'll be back soon!

55:02.892 --> 55:04.931
Let's try her again.

55:08.530 --> 55:11.730
Come on, Grandma. Pick up.

55:11.810 --> 55:13.970
She's not answering.

55:14.050 --> 55:18.769
Give it to me. Hello?

55:20.809 --> 55:24.009
Do we have to wait?
I mean, if we wanna leave now?

55:24.049 --> 55:27.849
No, Susan, you don't have to
wait. You can leave whenever you like.

55:27.889 --> 55:31.048
Listen, I know it's tough
to think about leaving our homes.

55:31.088 --> 55:34.767
But clearly it's the most responsible
thing to do right now.

55:34.847 --> 55:38.446
Quite likely, nothing will happen,
but it's better to be safe than sorry.

55:38.526 --> 55:41.527
I want you to remember, no one should
leave tonight without a copy...

55:41.607 --> 55:44.087
of the town's emergency
evacuation plan.

55:44.167 --> 55:47.286
They will be handed out
at the door on your way out.

55:47.366 --> 55:50.005
I'd like to turn the floor
over now to Dr. Harry Dalton.

55:50.085 --> 55:52.564
Thank you, Mayor Wando.
First of all,

55:52.644 --> 55:55.084
- I'd like to thank you for coming.
- It's all over, Les.

55:55.164 --> 55:58.605
I'm outta here before
it all hits the fan. Excuse me.

55:58.685 --> 56:01.724
I would like to underline that
these are just precautionary measures.

56:01.804 --> 56:05.283
Um, we don't want to start
a panic in any way.

56:05.363 --> 56:08.123
Did anybody feel that?

56:08.203 --> 56:12.283
Ladies and gentlemen,
please remain calm. Please, just stay...

56:19.762 --> 56:21.681
I felt that.

56:21.761 --> 56:24.641
Just stay calm, please!
Don't push!

56:24.721 --> 56:26.801
Please, stay calm!

56:26.881 --> 56:30.040
- Do not rush! Do not rush!
- Go towards the exits!

56:30.120 --> 56:33.119
- Don't panic!
- Do not push!

56:45.278 --> 56:47.878
Lauren! The mountain's
blowing up! Lauren!

56:51.137 --> 56:53.296
Ladies and gentlemen, please be calm!
Don't push!

56:57.897 --> 56:59.617
Please...

57:02.536 --> 57:05.016
Don't push!

57:05.096 --> 57:07.255
Don't push! It's okay!
Please!

57:07.295 --> 57:11.095
- You okay? You all right?
- Harry, go this way!

57:13.574 --> 57:17.734
- Stan, look at this!
- Why look at computers when you can look at the real thing?

57:17.814 --> 57:20.414
Greg, my sticks!

57:20.494 --> 57:23.934
It looks like it's about
to blow its top!

57:30.252 --> 57:32.212
This is not good.
This is not good!

57:34.251 --> 57:36.612
You okay?

57:39.292 --> 57:43.131
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, no!

57:49.290 --> 57:52.650
I've gotta get
to the kids.

57:54.730 --> 57:57.170
Go! Go, go!

58:11.727 --> 58:14.247
Watch out!

58:20.926 --> 58:23.326
Paul, come in.

58:23.446 --> 58:26.485
Paul? Can anybody hear me?
Paul?

58:26.565 --> 58:29.165
- Paul, come in. Come in.
- Look at that.

58:32.764 --> 58:34.764
Paul? Can anybody
hear me? Come in?

58:34.804 --> 58:37.525
Harry. Harry, we hear you.
Where are you?

58:37.605 --> 58:41.124
I'm heading to Rachel's to get her kids. Once I've
done that, I'm gonna come back down...

58:41.204 --> 58:44.203
...and help you pack out, okay?
- All right, Harry, listen.

58:44.243 --> 58:47.242
For whatever it's worth,
you were right and I was wrong.

58:47.282 --> 58:51.722
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. I'll see you later.

58:53.043 --> 58:55.682
She's blowin'!
She's goin'!

58:55.722 --> 58:58.042
Look ahead.

59:12.080 --> 59:14.879
Get out of the way!

59:20.759 --> 59:23.278
Somebody, help!

59:47.634 --> 59:51.235
- Where do we go?
- It's completely blocked. Go left.

59:51.275 --> 59:53.395
- I'm goin'. I'm goin'.
- Left, Harry!

59:57.954 --> 59:59.673
Look out!
Jesus!

01:00:03.673 --> 01:00:05.273
Shit!

01:00:05.393 --> 01:00:09.953
Make a right. Go down the alley!

01:00:44.227 --> 01:00:45.907
Come on. Come on.

01:01:27.543 --> 01:01:30.423
Harry, my truck's
not there.

01:01:34.502 --> 01:01:36.421
Graham?

01:01:37.501 --> 01:01:39.421
Lauren?

01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:44.500
Put on your seat belt.

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:49.420
- Do you know how to do all the gears?
- Yeah.

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:52.019
Graham? Lauren?

01:01:56.298 --> 01:02:00.778
- Oh God, they went up the mountain!
- Let's go. Let's go. Let's go!

01:02:07.098 --> 01:02:09.697
- Any other way across that bridge?
- No!

01:02:19.936 --> 01:02:23.015
You're out of your mind.
Oh, you're out of your mind.

01:02:23.095 --> 01:02:25.255
It's okay.

01:02:30.055 --> 01:02:32.454
- Harry?
- Okay, hang on.

01:02:36.733 --> 01:02:38.413
It's okay.

01:02:38.493 --> 01:02:42.853
- There's water coming in.
- This rig can take it. The engine's got a snorkel.

01:02:56.410 --> 01:02:59.291
Oh, God.
Look at those cars!

01:02:59.411 --> 01:03:02.010
They're crazy!
They'll never make it!

01:03:08.649 --> 01:03:10.569
- We're stuck?
- I know.

01:03:21.007 --> 01:03:22.447
Nothin'.

01:03:24.288 --> 01:03:28.168
Harry? See that car
coming at us?

01:03:28.208 --> 01:03:29.687
I see it.

01:03:31.687 --> 01:03:35.046
- Is he gonna hit us?
- No, we're all right. Hold on.

01:03:42.686 --> 01:03:44.646
We're all right.

01:03:56.724 --> 01:04:00.763
Jesus.

01:04:08.362 --> 01:04:11.442
- I can't see through the ash.
- Maybe you oughta turn the lights on.

01:04:11.522 --> 01:04:15.201
- They are on.
- Make the windshield wipers go faster?

01:04:15.236 --> 01:04:18.440
I don't know how.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:22.120
- It's that thing there.
- Don't touch things! You're gonna mess something up.

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.201
- Like what?
- I don't know. Something!

01:04:24.281 --> 01:04:27.640
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.

01:04:36.118 --> 01:04:38.678
Hey, wait for me!

01:04:52.036 --> 01:04:57.196
Uh-oh. Looks like our asshole pilot
plans on flying people outta here.

01:04:57.236 --> 01:05:00.396
If he gets any of that ash
sucked up into his engine, he's had it.

01:05:09.155 --> 01:05:12.554
- He's gettin' 15,000 bucks cold cash.
- Wait!

01:05:12.634 --> 01:05:16.153
Wait! Wait!
Wait! Wait!

01:05:16.193 --> 01:05:18.672
No, no, no!
Wait! Wait!

01:05:18.712 --> 01:05:22.193
Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:05:32.591 --> 01:05:35.070
Can't this thing
go any faster?

01:05:35.110 --> 01:05:37.231
Shit!

01:05:37.271 --> 01:05:38.951
- What is it?
- Shut up!

01:05:39.031 --> 01:05:41.191
What's the damn light?

01:05:49.269 --> 01:05:51.189
What the hell?

01:06:03.507 --> 01:06:06.267
Where are we?

01:06:06.387 --> 01:06:10.067
- Rachel, where are we?
- Uh, top of Exeter.

01:06:10.107 --> 01:06:12.826
Greg? Stan? Come in.

01:06:12.906 --> 01:06:16.265
We're at the top of Exeter Street. There's a
chopper down. Send the fire services.

01:06:16.345 --> 01:06:18.106
Jesus!
Okay, Harry.

01:06:18.186 --> 01:06:21.946
There's nothing we can do.
We've gotta go get your kids.

01:06:22.026 --> 01:06:24.385
- Okay.
- Greg, come in.

01:06:24.465 --> 01:06:28.424
It's Harry. Rachel's kids have gone up
the mountain. We're gonna go get them.

01:06:28.504 --> 01:06:32.343
Harry, we don't think you have
enough time. Do you copy?

01:06:32.423 --> 01:06:35.423
We do not think
you have enough time!

01:06:48.902 --> 01:06:51.181
- Grandma! Grandma!
- Grandma!

01:06:51.221 --> 01:06:53.981
- What are you doing here?
- We came to get you out.

01:06:54.061 --> 01:06:56.341
- What?
- Get in the truck! Now!

01:06:56.421 --> 01:06:59.500
- You drove up here all by yourself?
- We had to!

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:01.380
Your mama's gonna kill you.

01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:04.020
Roughy!

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:06.020
- We'll get her. Roughy!
- Roughy!

01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:08.659
Come on, Roughy!
We gotta go!

01:07:08.739 --> 01:07:10.818
Kids, get back here, now!

01:07:23.257 --> 01:07:27.656
God Almighty,
what were they thinking?

01:07:27.696 --> 01:07:31.455
How are they gonna get through this?

01:07:33.176 --> 01:07:36.176
- Ah! Harry! Oh!
- I got it.

01:07:45.534 --> 01:07:48.214
- Harry, watch out!
- It's okay.

01:07:55.333 --> 01:07:57.093
Oh, God!

01:07:57.133 --> 01:07:59.652
The road's gone. It's gone.

01:08:17.211 --> 01:08:19.810
Lauren! Graham!

01:08:23.170 --> 01:08:26.169
Lauren!

01:08:26.249 --> 01:08:28.247
Graham!

01:08:28.328 --> 01:08:31.009
Lauren!

01:08:31.089 --> 01:08:34.169
- We're coming!
- We're here!

01:08:35.768 --> 01:08:37.728
I'm sorry, Mom.

01:08:37.768 --> 01:08:41.687
Roughy ran away. It wasn't just
Graham's fault. It was my idea too.

01:08:41.767 --> 01:08:44.486
I am so mad at you!

01:08:44.606 --> 01:08:48.406
Children, inside, out of the ash.
Ruth. Ruth, it's okay.

01:08:55.446 --> 01:08:57.805
Stop looking at me
like it's my fault.

01:08:57.885 --> 01:09:01.125
Now, just take the kids,
get back in your truck and go home.

01:09:01.165 --> 01:09:05.243
We would if we could, but a landslide's
wiped out the entire road behind us.

01:09:08.603 --> 01:09:12.603
We've had plenty of minor eruptions.
Maybe we're over the hump.

01:09:12.683 --> 01:09:14.604
- Yeah, I hope.
- Get real, Beavis.

01:09:14.684 --> 01:09:19.162
She's just clearing her throat.
She hasn't even started to sing yet.

01:09:25.241 --> 01:09:29.640
- Paul, it's Harry. Is anyone there?
- Harry, where are you?

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.600
We're at Mirror Lake at the lodge.
The road's down, but we're okay.

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:36.359
This is turning into something
really catastrophic.

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:40.399
- I'll send a helicopter as soon as the ash clears away.
- Paul, get the hell outta there.

01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:43.840
- Don't wait for us.
- You're breaking up. Say again.

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:47.599
Paul, don't...

01:09:47.679 --> 01:09:49.798
Get outta there, now.
Please!

01:09:49.877 --> 01:09:53.318
- Harry, are you there?
- Maybe his battery's dead.

01:09:57.037 --> 01:10:01.837
I'm gonna stay as long as I can,
but I want you guys to leave right now.

01:10:01.917 --> 01:10:05.636
No way, Paul. We're not gonna walk out
on God's big show, right?

01:10:05.716 --> 01:10:08.156
Not a chance.

01:10:08.196 --> 01:10:13.756
- This mountain's never gonna hurt us.
- You're a fool. Come on.

01:10:23.114 --> 01:10:26.834
Oh, God. This was taken
the summer we built this place.

01:10:26.914 --> 01:10:31.474
- Brian was six months old.
- No time for a trip down memory lane.

01:10:31.594 --> 01:10:34.833
Rachel, Ruth, come on.
We gotta go. Have you got everything?

01:10:34.873 --> 01:10:37.032
Okay, children,
let's go.

01:10:41.712 --> 01:10:43.712
Move!

01:10:44.951 --> 01:10:47.711
Go! Come on, Ruth!

01:10:47.751 --> 01:10:51.791
- Come on, Mom! Come on!
- Into the water!

01:10:51.871 --> 01:10:54.030
Go, children, go, go.

01:11:00.150 --> 01:11:03.309
Get in the boat.
That's it.

01:11:03.389 --> 01:11:06.308
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Lauren.

01:11:06.388 --> 01:11:09.028
Get in. Get in!
Get in!

01:11:09.068 --> 01:11:12.269
We can't leave Roughy!

01:11:12.349 --> 01:11:15.668
Roughy! Roughy!

01:11:18.267 --> 01:11:20.187
Roughy!

01:11:38.784 --> 01:11:41.544
Mom, the fish,
they're all dead.

01:11:58.942 --> 01:12:01.461
Graham!
Don't touch the water!

01:12:01.581 --> 01:12:05.141
Lauren, come sit over here,
sweetie. That's it, sweetheart.

01:12:05.221 --> 01:12:07.981
Okay, everybody put
your feet up.

01:12:08.021 --> 01:12:10.021
Ruth, put your feet up,
please.

01:12:11.701 --> 01:12:15.020
Volcanic activity
has turned the lake to acid.

01:12:20.939 --> 01:12:24.259
- Acid eats metal.
- Hmm?

01:12:24.339 --> 01:12:28.459
- Is the boat gonna sink?
- No, no, no, sugar. It's not gonna sink.

01:12:34.897 --> 01:12:40.057
Hey, if you're scared,
you can have my crystal.

01:12:42.616 --> 01:12:45.257
- I can have it?
- Yeah.

01:12:46.656 --> 01:12:48.776
Thank you.

01:13:46.808 --> 01:13:51.008
Oh, shit! Oh, shit.

01:13:51.088 --> 01:13:55.687
We lost the prop.

01:13:55.767 --> 01:13:57.567
- No.
- We lost the prop.

01:13:57.647 --> 01:14:01.847
Okay, don't worry, all right?

01:14:01.887 --> 01:14:06.127
Go up there with Grandma.
That's a good girl. Quickly as you can.

01:14:06.167 --> 01:14:09.126
- Keep your feet up.
- Come on, darling. Careful.

01:14:09.166 --> 01:14:11.285
Keep your feet up.
Keep your feet up.

01:14:11.365 --> 01:14:15.204
- We're very, very close.
- Graham, move over there and keep the boat in balance.

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:19.964
- Get up there and balance the boat.
- We're very close. Very close.

01:14:20.044 --> 01:14:23.804
Is this boat sinking?

01:14:25.644 --> 01:14:28.323
It's okay.

01:14:28.403 --> 01:14:31.842
- Keep trying.
- Grandma, the boat's sinking!

01:14:31.882 --> 01:14:35.842
No, it's not gonna sink, sweetie pie.
We're very close.

01:14:35.882 --> 01:14:40.041
Mom, we're sinking!

01:14:41.082 --> 01:14:43.561
We're sinking!
We're sinking!

01:14:43.641 --> 01:14:46.681
- The boat's sinking.
- Keep your feet up.

01:14:49.081 --> 01:14:51.720
We're sinking!

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:54.959
- The boat's sinking!
- No, it isn't.

01:14:55.039 --> 01:14:56.404
We're not gonna make it!

01:14:56.439 --> 01:14:57.199
We're not gonna make it!

01:14:57.279 --> 01:14:59.919
Sit right there
and you hold on tight.

01:15:04.439 --> 01:15:08.398
Children, stay put!
Ruth! Get in! Ruth!

01:15:08.438 --> 01:15:11.037
- Ruth, get in! Get in! Come on!
- No!

01:15:14.117 --> 01:15:17.357
Children! Children!

01:15:20.117 --> 01:15:24.076
Ruth, get to shore!

01:15:24.116 --> 01:15:26.876
Ruth, get out!

01:15:29.315 --> 01:15:32.795
- I got her. I got her. You're okay.
- Grandma!

01:15:35.514 --> 01:15:37.794
Grandma! Grandma!

01:15:38.955 --> 01:15:41.794
Grandma?

01:15:41.874 --> 01:15:45.914
She's gonna be okay.
Kids, just give us some room.

01:15:45.994 --> 01:15:48.113
- Grandma?
- Go on now.

01:15:48.193 --> 01:15:51.273
- Take your sister. That's a good boy.
- Graham.

01:15:51.353 --> 01:15:53.752
Take care of Lauren.
Take care of her.

01:15:56.791 --> 01:15:59.072
Look at her legs.

01:16:01.352 --> 01:16:05.671
Ruth, we're gonna get you down.
We're gonna get you down.

01:16:05.751 --> 01:16:07.910
- We gotta help Grandma.
- It's okay.

01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:12.389
- Let me just talk to the children.
- Oh, please.

01:16:12.509 --> 01:16:15.909
- I don't want Grandma to die.
- I know.

01:16:15.989 --> 01:16:20.709
- Is Grandma gonna die?
- We're all okay.

01:16:20.789 --> 01:16:24.748
Oh, dear God.
Oh, God.

01:16:46.146 --> 01:16:49.225
- Where's the lieutenant?
- He's over here in this vehicle.

01:16:51.225 --> 01:16:54.584
Boy, you're a sight for sore eyes.
Lieutenant, I want you to take your men,

01:16:54.664 --> 01:16:57.784
sweep every building
in town, top to bottom.

01:16:57.864 --> 01:17:00.984
- Everybody out, let's go!
- Get everybody on the truck and out.

01:17:01.064 --> 01:17:03.664
This thing's
gonna blow.

01:17:04.783 --> 01:17:06.743
Just hold on.

01:17:06.823 --> 01:17:10.542
Stop, please.
Please, stop!

01:17:10.622 --> 01:17:13.102
Please, stop!

01:17:13.142 --> 01:17:17.382
Here you go.

01:17:23.221 --> 01:17:26.220
Hang on, Ruth,
you're gonna be okay.

01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:28.660
Hold on.

01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:31.540
Here, Grandma.
Have my crystal.

01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:36.379
Oh, ladybug, that's so nice,
but you keep it for your luck, okay?

01:17:36.499 --> 01:17:39.579
Okay.

01:17:41.859 --> 01:17:45.178
Oh, God, Ruth.

01:17:45.218 --> 01:17:49.817
I'm so sorry for what I said to you up
there. I really didn't mean it. I just...

01:17:49.897 --> 01:17:52.297
You're right what you said.
I am a fool.

01:17:52.377 --> 01:17:54.297
No, you're not.

01:17:55.897 --> 01:17:58.377
My son's the biggest fool
of all.

01:17:58.497 --> 01:18:01.176
He never should've run off
and hurt you all like that.

01:18:02.856 --> 01:18:07.415
If anybody's a fool,
Ruth, it's me,

01:18:07.535 --> 01:18:11.815
'cause I don't think
I ever really gave you a chance.

01:18:11.895 --> 01:18:15.615
Hang on, Grandma. It's just
another two miles to the ranger station.

01:18:15.695 --> 01:18:20.254
I don't think I have another
two miles left in me, Ace.

01:18:20.334 --> 01:18:23.133
- It's okay.
- No, Grandma.

01:18:23.213 --> 01:18:25.533
I get to stay
on my mountain.

01:18:25.613 --> 01:18:28.493
No.

01:18:32.852 --> 01:18:35.292
Grandma?

01:18:37.371 --> 01:18:39.691
Ruth?

01:19:08.607 --> 01:19:11.688
I got the van!
You go with these fellas!

01:19:11.768 --> 01:19:14.847
Harry? Harry, I don't know
whether you can hear me. It's Paul.

01:19:14.967 --> 01:19:18.566
Harry, the bridge is about
to go. We got everybody out.

01:19:18.646 --> 01:19:20.806
We got everybody...

01:19:20.886 --> 01:19:23.926
Take care.
Take great care.

01:20:22.238 --> 01:20:24.598
Okay, there you go.

01:20:31.877 --> 01:20:33.956
There's no keys.

01:20:36.637 --> 01:20:41.076
Here we go. Yeah.

01:21:19.551 --> 01:21:21.151
Oooh!

01:21:51.027 --> 01:21:53.227
Dreyfus!

01:21:55.066 --> 01:21:58.226
Paul!

01:21:58.266 --> 01:22:00.505
Come on. Come on.

01:22:05.385 --> 01:22:08.345
- Come on.
- Paul! Come on. Get out!

01:22:15.783 --> 01:22:18.304
Get out!

01:22:23.662 --> 01:22:26.063
- Paul! Paul!
- You gotta jump!

01:22:26.103 --> 01:22:29.742
You gotta jump!

01:22:31.861 --> 01:22:33.462
Come on!

01:22:33.542 --> 01:22:35.541
- Hey, Paul!
- Paul!

01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:54.859
- Come on.
- We're running out of time. Let's go.

01:22:58.218 --> 01:23:00.057
Hurry!

01:23:06.138 --> 01:23:08.057
What the...

01:23:11.576 --> 01:23:13.536
Great.

01:23:13.576 --> 01:23:15.936
Just great.

01:23:16.016 --> 01:23:19.016
- Can we drive across there?
- I don't know.

01:23:19.056 --> 01:23:22.175
- I don't know.
- Kids, why don't you get in the back?

01:23:22.255 --> 01:23:23.775
Okay.

01:23:23.815 --> 01:23:26.575
- Go on, Lauren.
- Go... in the back.

01:23:35.054 --> 01:23:38.533
Okay... here we go.

01:23:48.972 --> 01:23:51.731
No, Mommy!

01:23:53.651 --> 01:23:57.570
- Harry, we're on fire.
- The truck's on fire!

01:23:57.610 --> 01:23:59.571
We're burning!

01:24:04.330 --> 01:24:06.650
- Mommy?
- Hold on.

01:24:06.690 --> 01:24:09.529
We're stuck in the lava!

01:24:16.928 --> 01:24:19.888
- Ooh!
- More lava's comin' down the hill!

01:24:21.968 --> 01:24:25.607
Mommy! What are we gonna do?
Mommy!

01:24:25.687 --> 01:24:28.207
It's okay! It's okay!

01:24:28.287 --> 01:24:31.527
- Come on! Come on!
- Please.

01:24:35.486 --> 01:24:38.245
Yes! Yes!

01:24:39.845 --> 01:24:41.845
There's Roughy!

01:24:41.925 --> 01:24:43.806
- Where?
- Right there!

01:24:43.886 --> 01:24:46.125
- We have to help her.
- I gotta get her.

01:24:46.205 --> 01:24:49.804
Go get her. Go.

01:24:52.044 --> 01:24:55.763
- Roughy!
- Only gonna get one chance at this!

01:24:55.843 --> 01:24:59.163
Come on, Roughy, jump! Jump!

01:24:59.243 --> 01:25:01.043
Yes!

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:26.199
Eight years it took us
to get this town on its feet.

01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:28.879
You wouldn't believe
the struggle.

01:25:30.119 --> 01:25:32.039
Look at it.

01:26:01.275 --> 01:26:03.995
Our house is gone.

01:26:04.035 --> 01:26:07.634
There's no other way
out of town.

01:26:17.233 --> 01:26:21.672
We're reporting live from Dante's Peak,
where they're evacuating the town.

01:26:26.672 --> 01:26:30.471
Bring her back!
All the way back!

01:26:30.511 --> 01:26:33.910
- Keep moving!
- She's gotta go soon.

01:26:59.668 --> 01:27:01.787
Oh, my God!

01:27:01.867 --> 01:27:04.747
Wait.

01:27:14.105 --> 01:27:16.746
Okay. We're outta here.

01:27:16.786 --> 01:27:20.265
- What do we need this for?
- Might just come in handy.

01:27:55.621 --> 01:27:58.940
- Mom, what is that? Mom?
- What is that?

01:27:59.020 --> 01:28:00.980
That is a pyroclastic cloud.

01:28:08.099 --> 01:28:11.458
- Mommy.
- It's okay, baby.

01:28:11.498 --> 01:28:14.138
Mom, it's coming!

01:28:19.017 --> 01:28:22.337
- Mom!
- Oh, my God!

01:28:22.417 --> 01:28:25.537
Don't look back, kids!
Don't look back!

01:28:39.735 --> 01:28:42.734
- Mom, it's right behind us!
- Oh, sweet Jesus!

01:28:49.213 --> 01:28:52.094
Get down, kids! Get down!

01:29:20.210 --> 01:29:22.250
Oh, my God.

01:29:33.409 --> 01:29:36.008
- So long, Harry.
- Oh, no.

01:29:36.088 --> 01:29:38.328
So long.

01:29:39.687 --> 01:29:41.927
Watch your eyes, children.
Watch your eyes.

01:29:45.966 --> 01:29:50.327
- Lauren! Graham. Talk to me.
- Mommy?

01:29:50.407 --> 01:29:54.326
You all right, baby?
Graham? Graham, talk to me.

01:29:54.406 --> 01:29:58.845
All right, we gotta get out of here.
Can you do it? You can do it.

01:29:58.885 --> 01:30:01.404
- Here we go.
- Grab her, Harry!

01:30:01.484 --> 01:30:04.684
- I got her. Out we go, sweetheart.
- Graham.

01:30:04.764 --> 01:30:09.204
Stand right there, darling.
Okay, all right. Come on up, Graham.

01:30:09.284 --> 01:30:12.643
- Rachel, come on!
- Mom!

01:30:12.723 --> 01:30:15.522
Come on, Roughy.

01:30:15.602 --> 01:30:19.083
Roughy!

01:30:19.163 --> 01:30:23.761
Graham, you lead the way. I want you
to show us the way to your hideout.

01:30:25.681 --> 01:30:27.920
Come on.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.561
Come on, Mom. Roughy!

01:30:32.641 --> 01:30:34.681
Roughy?

01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:37.800
Oh, boy.

01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:40.159
Here are flashlights.

01:30:40.239 --> 01:30:44.878
Um, I have some chips and some crackers
and some drinks back here.

01:30:44.958 --> 01:30:47.999
All right, let's
check out the damage.

01:30:48.079 --> 01:30:52.398
- My head hurts.
- I know, baby. So does mine.

01:30:52.478 --> 01:30:57.957
- Oh, no. I forgot E.L.F. I left it in the truck.
- What do you need that for?

01:30:58.037 --> 01:31:01.917
It's a transmitter designed by NASA.
We were testing it for them.

01:31:01.997 --> 01:31:05.716
I was hoping it would send a signal so
people would realize we were down here.

01:31:05.796 --> 01:31:07.836
- I'm gonna go back and get it.
- I'll come with you.

01:31:07.916 --> 01:31:11.036
- No, stay here. It's a lot safer.
- What if you get lost?

01:31:11.116 --> 01:31:15.076
Graham, just stay here, okay?
Look after your sister and your mother.

01:31:15.156 --> 01:31:18.315
We're not gonna
get out, are we?

01:31:19.794 --> 01:31:22.434
Oh, yes, we are, baby.
Yes, we are.

01:31:24.553 --> 01:31:26.834
Come here.

01:31:26.914 --> 01:31:30.514
Come here. Just sit down a second.
Sit down a second.

01:31:30.594 --> 01:31:33.873
All right.
Listen, now.

01:31:33.953 --> 01:31:36.072
Have you ever been
deep-sea fishing?

01:31:37.072 --> 01:31:40.391
- No.
- Good. Neither have I.

01:31:40.471 --> 01:31:45.111
So, when we get out of here...
and we will get out of here...

01:31:45.191 --> 01:31:48.631
what do you say we go down to Florida,
we get ourselves a boat,

01:31:48.711 --> 01:31:52.390
and we stock it with all
the nicest, yummiest things...

01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:54.750
we can possibly get
our hands on,

01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:59.310
and we go out there and we catch
ourselves a big, old, fat fish?

01:31:59.390 --> 01:32:02.229
Hmm? Does that
sound good?

01:32:05.429 --> 01:32:07.389
It sounds good, Harry.

01:32:07.429 --> 01:32:09.708
Yeah, Harry,
it sounds great.

01:32:09.788 --> 01:32:12.148
Okay, stay here.

01:32:12.228 --> 01:32:15.548
I'll be back in a flash.
Chins up. Okay.

01:32:17.307 --> 01:32:19.467
Uh, Graham,

01:32:19.507 --> 01:32:23.146
you think you could find some
rope so we could tie up Roughy?

01:32:23.226 --> 01:32:25.146
Yeah.

01:32:25.226 --> 01:32:27.907
Let's fix you up, okay?

01:32:27.947 --> 01:32:31.106
And maybe some water
so we can clean these cuts up.

01:32:32.665 --> 01:32:35.985
Harry!

01:32:36.025 --> 01:32:38.424
Harry!

01:32:41.423 --> 01:32:44.065
- No!
- Harry!

01:32:44.145 --> 01:32:46.144
Get back! Get back!

01:32:46.224 --> 01:32:48.663
Rachel!

01:32:48.743 --> 01:32:51.903
Rachel!

01:32:57.142 --> 01:32:59.102
Rachel!

01:33:00.861 --> 01:33:04.901
Aah!

01:33:27.859 --> 01:33:31.218
Ooh. Oh, shit.

01:33:31.298 --> 01:33:34.737
Oh, my... God.

01:34:17.851 --> 01:34:21.531
Aah!

01:36:26.396 --> 01:36:29.915
- Terrific.
- Thank you.

01:36:34.475 --> 01:36:36.395
- Frank?
- Yeah?

01:36:36.475 --> 01:36:40.434
- How long's this light been blinking?
- Don't know. A day or two.

01:36:42.194 --> 01:36:44.433
Thank you, NASA.

01:36:44.513 --> 01:36:48.238
Thank you, NASA. Thank you, NASA.
Thank you, NASA!

01:36:48.273 --> 01:36:52.112
All right, you can get out now.
You're all set. All right.

01:36:52.192 --> 01:36:55.351
Just give me your hand.

01:36:59.231 --> 01:37:01.591
Oh, hang on!

01:37:27.707 --> 01:37:29.667
Sir!

01:37:29.747 --> 01:37:31.907
Get the crutches.

01:37:37.707 --> 01:37:40.626
I think they got him!

01:37:46.666 --> 01:37:50.225
Harry! Harry! Hey, man, we thought
you were toast!

01:37:50.265 --> 01:37:52.944
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:37:53.024 --> 01:37:55.704
Rachel and the children
are still down there.

01:37:55.784 --> 01:37:58.584
When that E.L.F. signal went off,
I damn near fell out of my chair.

01:37:58.664 --> 01:38:02.264
- He started screaming, "Thanks, NASA!"
- The old tin box worked.

01:38:02.344 --> 01:38:05.743
- It sure did.
- Rachel and the children are still there. Where's Paul?

01:38:05.823 --> 01:38:07.742
He didn't make it.

01:38:10.262 --> 01:38:12.261
At least he got to
see the show.

01:38:12.501 --> 01:38:14.942
All the way! Back up!
I need people with me!

01:38:14.982 --> 01:38:17.582
Move up the hill, people!
Move it!

01:38:17.662 --> 01:38:19.781
Let's go!

01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:28.619
Move it. Move it!

01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:38.259
Haul it up!

01:38:45.378 --> 01:38:47.937
It's already secure.

01:38:55.897 --> 01:38:58.897
Keep clear.
Keep clear. Look out.

01:39:03.896 --> 01:39:07.375
We've got survivors back here.
Get out of the way.

01:39:18.734 --> 01:39:21.453
Graham! Graham!

01:39:21.533 --> 01:39:24.612
Mom, it's Harry!
He's alive!

01:39:27.092 --> 01:39:29.532
It's good to see you.

01:40:03.768 --> 01:40:08.207
Did you really mean what you said
about taking us fishing?

01:40:08.247 --> 01:40:11.367
- I sure did.
- That's great.

01:40:18.646 --> 01:40:22.405
- You guys ready to go?
- Let's go.
