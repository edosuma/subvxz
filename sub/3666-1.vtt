It's not ironed

01:22.208 --> 01:24.794
It'll wrinkle after an hour anyway

01:25.836 --> 01:28.005
But it's nice to wear
a neatly pressed shirt

01:28.005 --> 01:29.381
Give me three minutes

01:29.465 --> 01:30.758
This is just fine

01:54.907 --> 01:56.784
There's no soup?

01:56.909 --> 01:59.787
Don't complain
or we'll switch to cereal

02:01.997 --> 02:03.874
The eggs look perfect

02:03.999 --> 02:05.709
Aren't you a sweetheart?

Can you buy me an MP3 player?

02:34.572 --> 02:36.866
What for?

02:37.324 --> 02:42.913
Just that... everyone else
has one and I don't

02:43.831 --> 02:45.374
What kind of a silly reason is that?

02:45.457 --> 02:49.086
Everyone has one
so, you must have one too?

02:49.378 --> 02:51.463
Make it an early birthday present

02:51.839 --> 02:54.758
Months in advance?

02:55.259 --> 02:56.510
Just get one for her

02:56.510 --> 02:57.928
Who said I wouldn't?

02:59.096 --> 03:01.932
How about next month?

03:02.349 --> 03:04.268
We have to renew the lease
this month

03:05.394 --> 03:09.190
Just listen from your phone
Who uses MP3 player these days?

03:11.400 --> 03:13.152
Wait up, Man-ji

03:13.194 --> 03:14.612

Sorry, honey...

03:50.356 --> 03:52.650
<i>Can you knit a hat for me
with my yarn?</i>

03:52.650 --> 03:56.278
First an MP3 player
and now, a woolly hat?

03:56.737 --> 03:57.905
One for stew, please

03:57.988 --> 04:00.741
Honey, I'm busy
Can we talk later?

04:21.262 --> 04:25.933
Your's looks as if
it's about to explode

04:26.350 --> 04:29.687
Dress like a dork
if you like getting picked on

04:29.895 --> 04:33.232
Just shut up and decide
which snack parlor

04:33.816 --> 04:36.819
Of course your diet
was going to last

04:39.029 --> 04:43.158
Look at the middle-schoolers
So sweet...

04:43.993 --> 04:48.163
That teacher loves making
the girls hug each... pervert!

04:48.414 --> 04:50.082
Yeah, that'll help them make up

04:50.708 --> 04:52.668
She's Mi-ra and Cheon-ji's
home room teacher

04:53.002 --> 04:55.587
Mi-ra...?
Oh, your sister!

04:56.422 --> 04:58.173
She and Cheon-ji
are in the same class?

04:58.465 --> 04:59.967
Didn't Cheon-ji tell you?

05:00.634 --> 05:02.803
Mi-ra talks about her sometimes

05:03.804 --> 05:04.972
What does she say?

05:05.472 --> 05:07.182
I don't think they're that close

05:07.474 --> 05:09.393
So, have we decided?

05:09.977 --> 05:10.894
Attal

05:10.978 --> 05:12.479
Okay

05:17.609 --> 05:18.485
What?

05:18.527 --> 05:21.071
<i>Was it MP3 player
that Cheon-ji wanted?</i>

05:21.322 --> 05:22.990
There are so many different kinds

05:23.032 --> 05:25.784
You said you needed to
save up for security deposit

05:25.951 --> 05:29.163
It's an MP3 player
It's not gonna make us homeless

05:29.830 --> 05:32.791
Can you ask her
which model she wants?

05:35.461 --> 05:37.796
There was something about her tone

05:38.130 --> 05:40.466
<i>She never asks for anything</i>

05:40.466 --> 05:42.009
I don't know... I gotta go

06:36.230 --> 06:39.358
<i>Cheon-ji died</i>

06:46.990 --> 06:52.454

<i>without leaving a note</i>

07:05.342 --> 07:06.677

07:08.095 --> 07:10.848
Don't ask her why
if you see her

07:14.017 --> 07:15.769
Just give her a hug

07:19.189 --> 07:20.524
<i>Bitch...</i>

07:22.901 --> 07:24.445
Good bye, baby

08:11.366 --> 08:15.913
How dare you talk about
my daughter that way

08:16.330 --> 08:20.584
when you could've just
asked me to move out

08:24.296 --> 08:25.672
Have a good life,
you rotten hag!

08:29.801 --> 08:31.845
Get us out of here
as fast as you can

08:36.390 --> 08:38.268
Why didn't you leave behind
the things we don't want?

08:39.269 --> 08:40.938
The hag tells me to
take everything

08:53.659 --> 08:58.038
It feels so weird
to be just you and me

09:03.794 --> 09:05.462
Thank you

09:09.800 --> 09:13.720
Hello!
We're moving into 103

09:19.268 --> 09:22.271
No room for privacy

09:23.438 --> 09:27.401
Doesn't it smell like
old public toilet in here?

09:28.402 --> 09:30.279
Didn't you check the apartment
when you signed the contract?

09:31.029 --> 09:33.824
I signed when I heard
it was Chowon Apartment

09:36.910 --> 09:39.371
Where do I sleep?

09:39.663 --> 09:41.415
We can sleep here together

09:41.665 --> 09:42.916
I don't think so

09:43.584 --> 09:45.460
Then, you take the living room

09:54.261 --> 09:58.140
We'll have to get rid of your desk
There's no room

09:58.432 --> 10:00.100
You don't want me to study?

10:02.769 --> 10:08.317
I'll get a small foldable table

10:08.734 --> 10:10.485
I'll just use Cheon-ji's

10:13.822 --> 10:15.157
It's okay

10:16.325 --> 10:17.534
Alright

10:19.202 --> 10:20.662
I'll put this in the balcony

10:20.704 --> 10:23.206
Let's clean it up first

10:32.299 --> 10:33.759
What is this smell?

10:33.800 --> 10:37.137
Look out for a hidden
secret toilet

10:46.772 --> 10:48.857
Can you get the garbage bag?

10:50.150 --> 10:52.235
- Oh my God!
- What?

10:52.611 --> 10:53.528
What?

10:55.989 --> 10:58.950
- What is it, mom?
- Rats

10:59.159 --> 11:01.244
- Oh, no... catch them
- You do it

11:01.244 --> 11:02.829
No, you do it, mom

11:06.500 --> 11:07.542
Who the hell are you?

11:07.626 --> 11:09.753
I live next door

11:10.337 --> 11:11.672
Are you a rocker?

11:13.757 --> 11:16.426
No, I'm studying for
the civil service exams

11:19.596 --> 11:23.767
That is one precise middle parting

11:25.435 --> 11:27.020
I appreciate the beauty of balance

11:28.105 --> 11:29.314
Freak...

11:29.690 --> 11:31.400
So, you're a man?

11:32.067 --> 11:33.568
What's going on inside?

11:34.778 --> 11:35.862
Rats...

11:36.279 --> 11:38.490
Yeah, it's a big problem
in this building

11:38.490 --> 11:41.952
They're swarming in the box
in the balcony

11:42.828 --> 11:46.373
Can I call 911 for this?

11:49.042 --> 11:50.961
Why don't you let me handle this?

11:58.051 --> 12:00.887
There is a dust pan
in the balcony

12:03.014 --> 12:04.558
Which box is it?

12:04.558 --> 12:08.562
The moldy one
in the furnace closet

12:10.647 --> 12:14.234
I'll close this first
in case they try to escape

12:19.030 --> 12:21.032
He's kind of dependable

12:42.763 --> 12:44.681
What's wrong?

12:48.977 --> 12:52.606
It's too big... I'm sorry

12:53.940 --> 12:55.108
Gives me the creeps

12:55.442 --> 12:57.110
So much for his big words

12:57.944 --> 13:01.865
Next time I see him,
I'll give him pigtails

13:01.948 --> 13:04.409
He almost broke that door

13:04.951 --> 13:06.495
Dependable?

13:07.454 --> 13:08.622
Did I say that?

13:08.955 --> 13:10.415
Shall we call the security?

13:10.874 --> 13:14.044
He won't lift a finger for free

13:17.589 --> 13:19.633
I couldn't find the big one

13:19.633 --> 13:21.635
- Argh
- Hey!

13:22.552 --> 13:24.387
You can't just catch the small one

13:24.471 --> 13:26.139
We'll see if it comes back

13:28.016 --> 13:31.561
I gave you 10 dollars
for that tiny little one?

13:31.645 --> 13:35.148
So, there might still be
a rat in there?

13:35.482 --> 13:38.193
Shall I get some bug spray?

13:38.652 --> 13:40.070
Like that's gonna kill a rat

13:40.946 --> 13:43.990
It'll kill the ticks
on rat's skin

13:44.366 --> 13:47.118
I have a feeling that
I'll run away soon

13:47.577 --> 13:50.539
I have a feeling I'll be
taking more shifts at work

13:51.665 --> 13:54.835
- Let me help you with other things
- No, thank you

13:54.918 --> 13:58.046
That one
We need to throw that out

14:00.507 --> 14:02.467
You can't let a stranger
in our house

14:02.509 --> 14:04.344
There's nothing for him to take

14:06.721 --> 14:08.515
What's your name?

14:09.349 --> 14:10.642
Lee Man-ji

14:10.767 --> 14:12.227
Lee Man-ji

14:14.187 --> 14:16.231
It's an easy name to make fun of

14:19.985 --> 14:21.528
I'm Chu Sang-bak

14:21.695 --> 14:27.325
Chusang Park or Chu Sangbak?

14:27.492 --> 14:30.120
It's Chu Sang-bak

14:31.705 --> 14:35.208
No charge for the glass
The board is three dollars

14:35.250 --> 14:38.378
The dresser, also three dollars
So, six dollars in total

14:38.420 --> 14:42.007
The board and the dresser are a set
You can't charge them separately

14:42.007 --> 14:46.636
It's the size that matters
Even as a set, it's six dollars

14:46.887 --> 14:48.138
Hey

14:48.430 --> 14:51.224
You charged me five dollars
for a dresser similar to this one

14:51.516 --> 14:54.853
You see?
I don't decide this as I want

14:54.853 --> 14:56.730
There are guidelines to follow

14:58.565 --> 15:00.025
Five dollars

15:00.025 --> 15:02.110
Oh, come on

15:03.069 --> 15:05.030
Isn't that Cheon-ji's friend?

15:05.906 --> 15:07.991
It's Hwa-yeon
Bosingak owner's daughter

15:13.121 --> 15:14.915
So, that's that

15:16.499 --> 15:19.336
I'm hungry
Let's get something to eat, Man-ji

15:24.257 --> 15:25.967
Can we have a word?

15:25.967 --> 15:27.135
What about?

15:27.469 --> 15:31.139
You can't charge people differently
as you please

15:31.139 --> 15:34.434
The economy isn't
what it used to me

15:34.434 --> 15:35.852
It was two weeks ago

15:36.978 --> 15:38.730
Okay

15:40.315 --> 15:43.485
Then, let's just settle for this

15:46.821 --> 15:48.865
I'm only doing this because
you're like a son to me

15:52.535 --> 15:53.828
Hello

15:56.081 --> 15:59.793
We just moved here. I guess
we'll be seeing each other around

16:00.251 --> 16:02.212
Right...

16:03.505 --> 16:04.756
I'm back

16:05.256 --> 16:08.468
We'll have two black bean noodles
with a sweet and sour pork

16:08.802 --> 16:10.595
- Two black noodles and one pork
- We can't eat all that

16:10.595 --> 16:12.305
We're not three people

16:12.430 --> 16:17.227
Of course, we can
We're gonna need that much energy

16:17.852 --> 16:21.147
- Can we cancel the pork?
- No, we'll have it

16:26.945 --> 16:29.906
You gotta eat black bean noodles
when you move

16:30.365 --> 16:34.869
I'm sick of moving
How come you never bought a house?

16:36.371 --> 16:39.708
By the time I save some money
the house price soars out of reach

16:40.041 --> 16:43.670
and you want to go to cram schools
to get good grades

16:43.837 --> 16:45.005
What choice do I have?

16:45.171 --> 16:46.506
Alright, I take it back

16:47.674 --> 16:51.428
New to the neighborhood?
We also deliver

16:51.678 --> 16:54.014
We'll pop around
We live next door

16:54.681 --> 16:58.810
How kind of you!
Enjoy your noodles

17:02.522 --> 17:06.526
Study hard for mom, okay?

17:06.859 --> 17:09.279
They say 'unlucky in marriage,
poor luck with children too'

17:09.529 --> 17:10.864
Prove them wrong

17:10.905 --> 17:13.867
With what luck
could I possibly achieve that?

17:13.950 --> 17:17.037
You talk back constantly

17:18.288 --> 17:24.252
It's good. We are the ones
that talk... I like that

17:26.421 --> 17:29.507
Mom, stop being so dramatic
You're making me uncomfortable

17:29.883 --> 17:31.217
Let's just stay the way
we used to be

17:31.301 --> 17:33.928
My daughter's nagging
gives me energy. It's good

17:52.405 --> 17:57.702
Let's get this straight, moron
I didn't end it because you're a bum

17:59.454 --> 18:05.960
Don't make the unemployment
problem your excuse

18:06.377 --> 18:09.047
You just hate working

18:10.215 --> 18:11.758
Don't wait for my call, you damn...

18:17.472 --> 18:21.184
Bastard... Why would I
tell you about moving?

18:22.936 --> 18:24.145
What?

18:25.271 --> 18:27.023
No, don't wait for me there

18:32.570 --> 18:37.575
Stop being pathetic
You've got kids to look after

18:39.994 --> 18:41.287
What?

18:43.957 --> 18:45.333
Cheon-ji's mom?

18:48.753 --> 18:50.922
Don't you dare mention
my daughter's name

19:08.106 --> 19:09.607
Good night

19:10.817 --> 19:11.985
Night

19:19.492 --> 19:23.538
Why did she do it?

19:24.956 --> 19:26.624
Do you know anything about it?

19:47.729 --> 19:48.855
What are you doing?

19:50.857 --> 19:53.109
I had borrowed it from Cheon-ji

19:54.861 --> 19:56.321
When?

19:56.362 --> 19:58.239
Three months ago maybe

19:58.531 --> 19:59.490
Three months?

19:59.490 --> 20:01.034
She never asked for it back

20:01.117 --> 20:03.912
So, you didn't bother returning it?

20:03.912 --> 20:06.497
I thought she'd come get it
if she needed it back

20:07.457 --> 20:10.084
So, she has to come to you
to kindly ask for it back

20:10.084 --> 20:12.170
It was only a gym uniform

20:12.212 --> 20:14.881
Of course
What about Cheon-ji

20:14.881 --> 20:17.508
who would've been terrified
what you might do if she say no?

20:17.550 --> 20:19.636
Why the fuck did
she have to kill herself?

20:19.636 --> 20:20.553
What?

20:22.347 --> 20:23.431
What did you say?

20:26.309 --> 20:30.730
Hwa-yeon gave it to me
saying it would fit me

20:30.813 --> 20:33.858
Are you friends with Hwa-yeon?

20:34.025 --> 20:36.236
We got close after she invited me
to her birthday party

20:36.402 --> 20:39.155
- What about Cheon-ji?
- She's not my style

20:41.950 --> 20:44.202
She was best friends with Hwa-yeon

20:44.285 --> 20:47.038
But I only know Hwa-yeon
not Cheon-ji

21:06.099 --> 21:08.017
I'm Cheon-ji's sister

21:11.312 --> 21:13.231
The scent is so thick

21:13.273 --> 21:14.774
Hi

21:19.862 --> 21:22.407
Can we have a word after school?

21:23.283 --> 21:24.492
Cheonji

21:26.577 --> 21:28.329
Hey

21:29.831 --> 21:31.249
Are you her sister?

21:31.291 --> 21:32.333
Yeah

21:32.583 --> 21:35.795
Hi!
I'm Cheon-ji's friend, Hwa-yeon

21:35.920 --> 21:37.297
Hwa-yeon

21:38.047 --> 21:42.635
It's so great to finally meet you
Why don't you buy me a pork cutlet?

21:43.761 --> 21:45.138
You don't have to

21:47.890 --> 21:51.519
You two are so different

21:53.062 --> 21:55.565
They say opposites attract

21:58.818 --> 22:00.945
I don't have enough
for pork cutlet but...

22:02.155 --> 22:04.949
Can we get two rice cakes
in chili sauce?

22:05.992 --> 22:07.327
Thank you

22:10.038 --> 22:11.122
Excuse me for a moment?

22:16.502 --> 22:18.004
I'm going

22:19.672 --> 22:21.215
I'm on my way

22:21.424 --> 22:23.468
- Here's your rice cake
- Thank you

22:23.468 --> 22:24.510
Hwa-yeon

22:24.844 --> 22:25.928
What are you doing?

22:26.179 --> 22:28.056
I met Cheon-ji's sister

22:28.639 --> 22:31.684
I asked her to get pork cutlet
but she's buying me rice cake instead

22:36.439 --> 22:37.732
So, what do you think?

22:43.071 --> 22:44.655
She's cute

22:50.411 --> 22:52.872
I felt bad about not buying you
that pork cutlet

22:57.377 --> 22:58.753
Thank you

23:00.922 --> 23:05.218
I heard you and Cheon-ji were best friends
You must be upset

23:05.802 --> 23:09.889
I've known her since elementary school
but we weren't best friends

23:10.848 --> 23:15.478
I don't know what the girls
said about the day she died

23:16.604 --> 23:20.566
but Cheon-ji seemed quite upset
during the presentation

23:22.527 --> 23:25.154
What are the evils of prejudice?

23:25.405 --> 23:29.409
Especially when it is
maliciously disseminated

23:29.867 --> 23:32.370
Let's look at some common ways
in which prejudice can be fostered

23:32.787 --> 23:37.041
One, slander disguised
as a compliment

23:37.417 --> 23:40.837
People react more sensitively
to smaller points than the basis

23:41.129 --> 23:42.130
Example:

23:42.422 --> 23:45.883
'She always gets good grades
but she's actually quite dumb'

23:46.217 --> 23:50.555
Basis, good grades,
point, dumb

23:52.557 --> 23:56.060
Your cruel words can kill

23:57.437 --> 24:02.108
Are you a murderer in the making?

24:06.696 --> 24:07.989
Thank you

24:12.076 --> 24:16.205
What an interesting presentation!

24:16.831 --> 24:20.501
But 'a murdererin the making'?
Don't you think you took too far?

24:21.169 --> 24:23.296
Should I have said
a 'confirmed murderer' instead?

24:25.923 --> 24:29.135
I'm sorry, Cheon-ji
I'm really sorry, okay?

24:29.302 --> 24:30.428
Let me go

24:35.141 --> 24:36.809
Cheon-ji, I'm sorry

24:37.643 --> 24:39.729
Why do you always apologize to her?

24:40.188 --> 24:41.314
What's the matter with her?

24:41.355 --> 24:43.024
It's not like you ever
did anything to her

24:43.024 --> 24:45.067
- What a self-absorbed bitch!
- Totally

24:45.902 --> 24:50.865
She was going through something
terrible and I never knew it

24:52.325 --> 24:54.911
So, I told myself that
I'll be a better friend for her

24:55.077 --> 24:58.623
I only asked you if you were upset
and that's a pretty long answer

25:01.626 --> 25:03.753
I thought you might want to know

25:06.130 --> 25:08.841
Does everyone have MP3 players?

25:10.510 --> 25:14.347
Probably, although I can't
be bother to carry mine around

25:14.680 --> 25:15.640
Why?

25:15.640 --> 25:18.809
Cheon-ji was asking for
an MP3 player before she died

25:19.185 --> 25:20.978
I wondered if you knew
anything about it

25:26.859 --> 25:31.197
We were going to exchange gifts
for our birthdays

25:32.823 --> 25:34.367
Was it your birthday?

25:35.785 --> 25:37.328
Among close friends,

25:37.328 --> 25:40.456
we pick out the presents
and give each other before the birthdays

25:41.290 --> 25:42.750
An early present...

25:42.833 --> 25:45.545
an MP3 player
that you rarely use, no less?

25:46.796 --> 25:47.964
That doesn't seem right

25:48.047 --> 25:51.467
There are cheap ones, too
For 20 dollars or less

25:52.385 --> 25:57.223
Stupid girl... troubled over an MP3
when there are cheaper ones, too

25:59.809 --> 26:01.102
Why aren't you eating?

26:01.644 --> 26:02.728
I am

26:06.315 --> 26:08.901
Are you close with Soo-gyeong?

26:10.945 --> 26:14.824
She's a delinquent
She's a friend of a friend's

26:17.034 --> 26:21.414
but she seemed close with Cheon-ji
They lend each other gym uniforms

26:22.957 --> 26:27.253
They used to lend each other
gym uniforms?

26:27.628 --> 26:29.213
Well, yeah...

26:39.390 --> 26:42.977
I didn't know you moved
to my neighborhood

26:43.603 --> 26:47.732
I saw you yesterday
I thought you saw me, too

26:48.107 --> 26:50.735
I would've said hi
if I did

26:53.863 --> 26:56.741
These apartments are so old,
aren't they?

26:57.241 --> 27:00.286
I lived here all my life
I'm so sick of this place

27:00.870 --> 27:05.374
but my parents won't go anywhere
unless the restaurant shuts down

27:06.500 --> 27:09.670
Well, our black bean noodle
is quite famous in this area

27:10.129 --> 27:11.297
You

27:13.674 --> 27:15.968
You can't stand the silence,
can you?

27:18.095 --> 27:19.889
It makes you nervous

27:20.139 --> 27:23.017
So, this is what she meant

27:24.644 --> 27:29.815
I just didn't want to be rude
since you treated me

27:29.899 --> 27:31.776
Cheon-ji said that you were cool

27:31.984 --> 27:33.486
You really are

27:34.403 --> 27:38.324
I think she once said that
it's hard to talk to you

27:39.158 --> 27:41.243
Then again, I'm not sure

27:46.666 --> 27:50.670
There's nothing cool about
being cool-headed about your sister's death

27:51.671 --> 27:56.759
But I guess it's okay
to talk about it now

27:58.094 --> 27:59.970
I think I'll look for
her suicide note

28:01.263 --> 28:02.723
I thought she didn't leave
any note

28:02.973 --> 28:05.768
Why wouldn't she?
I just haven't looked yet

28:06.352 --> 28:08.854
Maybe I'll start soon

28:10.564 --> 28:11.899
or not

28:18.197 --> 28:19.615
<i>Declaration of Friendship</i>

28:19.615 --> 28:20.700
Cheonji

28:24.036 --> 28:26.664
Are you still mad at me?

28:27.331 --> 28:30.000
I already told everyone
that it was a joke

28:31.377 --> 28:33.879
Didn't I correct myself about

28:33.879 --> 28:35.840
Cheon-ji being bullied
in elementary school?

28:35.840 --> 28:41.220
Are you still mad about that?

28:42.138 --> 28:45.891
No, I never heard that
It's not about that

28:45.975 --> 28:48.310
Alright!
I'm sorry anyway, okay?

28:48.394 --> 28:49.311
Come here

28:51.731 --> 28:53.858
Let's sign a
Declaration of Friendship

28:54.900 --> 28:56.235
Sign here

29:02.867 --> 29:06.412
This certified that Lee Cheon-ji
and Kim Hwa-yeon are best friends

29:10.875 --> 29:13.794
Hey, that MP3 player you're
getting me for my birthday

29:13.878 --> 29:17.339
Give it to me to commemorate
becoming best friends

29:17.590 --> 29:20.593
I'll give you the digital camera

29:39.820 --> 29:42.740
Mi-ran, tell me what your sister
told you about Cheon-ji

29:43.324 --> 29:44.825
About Cheon-ji and Hwa-yeon

29:48.954 --> 29:50.956
Come and have a taste

29:51.624 --> 29:53.959
It's specially cooked in
low temperature for extra flavor

29:54.251 --> 29:54.960
It's really good

29:54.960 --> 29:58.005
There's no additives
or preservatives...

30:04.595 --> 30:05.471
Noodle, quickly

30:05.554 --> 30:06.472
With sauce?

30:06.555 --> 30:08.724
- No, in soup
- Coming right up

30:08.724 --> 30:09.809
Give me a large one

30:09.892 --> 30:11.310
- A large one
- Double portion

30:14.980 --> 30:16.607
The noodle's cooked just right

30:29.161 --> 30:32.540
What's the matter, 'Tofu'?

30:37.503 --> 30:40.005
I just buried my baby

30:47.847 --> 30:51.976
and I'm sitting here stuffing
myself with an extra large noodle

30:52.768 --> 30:54.645
trying to live

30:59.066 --> 31:01.527
She's watching you from above
Go on, eat

31:19.420 --> 31:21.380
This is Cheon-ji's stuff

31:22.339 --> 31:25.593
You live in the same building
as her family?

31:25.968 --> 31:27.845
Her sister asked you to
bring this over for her

31:28.971 --> 31:29.972
Okay

31:50.784 --> 31:56.498
It's true that we were best friends
but she made me feel suffocating

31:57.249 --> 32:01.295
She would nitpick over
every little thing

32:02.421 --> 32:04.006
Put the box in there

32:05.424 --> 32:08.427
I was the only friend she had

32:08.510 --> 32:10.804
Wasn't it because of you
that she only had you?

32:11.680 --> 32:14.934
Look, I just felt bad about denying
she was my best friend, that's all

32:15.267 --> 32:19.188
Don't try to provoke me
You won't get anywhere

32:19.813 --> 32:21.357
Thanks for bringing it over

32:25.653 --> 32:27.613
- Your youngest got over cold?
- Yes

32:27.613 --> 32:31.283
Hey, I know these are
promotional give aways

32:35.412 --> 32:36.747
- Thanks
- Sure

32:39.833 --> 32:41.001
What's he doing here?

32:41.210 --> 32:43.003
He's enjoying the free buffet

32:43.504 --> 32:45.005
I think he came to see you

32:45.965 --> 32:48.467
That pathetic asshole

32:49.468 --> 32:52.054
If I saved up every penny
I spent on him...

32:52.304 --> 32:54.807
Who can I blame, but myself?

32:56.809 --> 32:57.935
Hello

32:59.979 --> 33:01.355
Oh, sorry

33:01.772 --> 33:03.941
Your hair...

33:05.859 --> 33:07.111
Can I get three blocks of tofu?

33:07.319 --> 33:09.947
Are you throwing a party?

33:09.989 --> 33:11.365
I'm making dumplings

33:11.573 --> 33:12.825
And, you need three blocks?

33:13.158 --> 33:16.620
I make a fridge load at a time
and have them for meals

33:16.787 --> 33:18.372
If you're making dumplings

33:18.831 --> 33:22.001
get the cheaper ones over there
These are pricy

33:24.003 --> 33:26.714
Oh... thank you

33:39.601 --> 33:40.686
Do you know him?

33:40.853 --> 33:42.021
He lives next door

33:42.271 --> 33:45.858
A man who makes
his own dumplings

33:47.026 --> 33:48.569
Do you know what shampoo he uses?

33:49.695 --> 33:51.113
How would I know that?

33:51.196 --> 33:52.990
He has a beautiful silky hair

33:54.992 --> 33:56.910
Can you ask him for me?

34:00.247 --> 34:01.457
Should I get a transplant?

34:04.460 --> 34:06.086
Dear me... I'm sorry

34:06.211 --> 34:09.840
Can we have a word?

34:10.507 --> 34:12.760
Piss off
before I call the security

34:12.885 --> 34:14.053
You want me to?

34:15.471 --> 34:20.851
I just want to talk
Or I'll come everyday

34:21.268 --> 34:22.728
It'll only be a second

34:23.187 --> 34:27.733
I'm sorry for everything
Let's start over

34:27.733 --> 34:31.527
You've done nothing wrong
I just don't like you anymore

34:31.570 --> 34:33.405
No, come on
Forgive me

34:33.572 --> 34:35.741
- Let me go
- I won't

34:35.741 --> 34:36.909
For crying out loud!

34:38.159 --> 34:39.286
Jeez...

34:42.039 --> 34:44.458
I miss you so much
that I can't do anything

34:44.458 --> 34:45.918
Get off of me

34:47.710 --> 34:48.587
What the heck?

34:52.591 --> 34:54.592
Have you lost your mind?

34:55.969 --> 34:57.346
Leave her alone

35:01.683 --> 35:02.768
What the hell?

35:04.561 --> 35:05.437
You crazy bastard...

35:06.730 --> 35:07.773
You crazy bitch!

35:07.773 --> 35:10.484
What's your problem, bitch?

35:10.484 --> 35:12.152
Stop it

35:12.152 --> 35:13.654
Bitch

35:13.987 --> 35:14.988
Here

35:15.114 --> 35:17.241
Come on

35:20.619 --> 35:21.995
Over here

35:21.995 --> 35:24.498
Don't ignore my calls, okay?

35:32.965 --> 35:35.008
I was about to strike back

35:35.092 --> 35:38.262
You were letting him
beat you down all he wants

35:40.639 --> 35:42.724
I used to be bullied back
in high school

35:42.724 --> 35:44.351
so, I learned boxing

35:45.978 --> 35:49.314
If you cover your face and torso,
it really doesn't hurt

35:50.399 --> 35:51.817
Are you sure you're okay?

35:51.817 --> 35:52.734
Absolutely

35:54.862 --> 35:57.865
Can I touch your hair
for a second?

36:03.120 --> 36:05.539
No? Oh, thank you

36:15.132 --> 36:16.049
That's her

36:18.093 --> 36:20.387
That girl in Class III
died because of her

36:31.899 --> 36:34.735
<i>Switching seats</i>

36:46.580 --> 36:51.919
I can't believe we're doing this
in middle school

36:53.879 --> 36:56.089
You said Cheon-ji's father
killed himself

36:56.381 --> 36:57.633
When did say that?

36:57.966 --> 36:59.218
At your birthday party

37:00.552 --> 37:01.929
Did I?

37:01.929 --> 37:04.389
My sister is friends with Man-ji

37:04.890 --> 37:08.018
She asked me about
you and Cheon-ji

37:10.062 --> 37:12.940
She hit the ceiling when
I told her about the father's suicide

37:13.232 --> 37:15.234
She said he was
killed in an accident

37:16.401 --> 37:19.321
I don't remember saying that...

37:19.655 --> 37:22.449
But it's true
You said that

37:22.866 --> 37:24.952
You said that Cheon-ji is
somber because of that

37:25.744 --> 37:27.746
Fine!
Tell Man-ji everything

37:28.330 --> 37:33.126
I see so much of her everyday
that I'm growing fond of her

37:40.884 --> 37:43.136
You moved to my school
in fifth grade

37:43.220 --> 37:45.347
I always wanted
to be friends with you

37:45.681 --> 37:49.851
Picking out your next target?

37:51.186 --> 37:52.938
That hurts

37:54.606 --> 37:58.694
I heard that your specialty
was the new girls

37:58.777 --> 38:02.990
They warned me to be careful
or I'll end up like Cheon-ji

38:04.116 --> 38:08.495
What nonsense!
Cheon-ji and I were best friends

38:08.620 --> 38:10.956
Do friends do exactly
as they're told?

38:11.039 --> 38:13.000
I asked her favors and
she did them for me

38:13.000 --> 38:16.295
You call them favors?
They were orders and coercion

38:17.462 --> 38:20.132
I'm the only one that
actually hung out with her

38:20.590 --> 38:24.094
Did any of you even look at her?

38:32.561 --> 38:36.982
How convenient for you is it
that she never fought back?

38:37.065 --> 38:39.651
How could you be so relentless
about bullying her?

38:39.985 --> 38:41.611
I would've killed myself, too

38:43.905 --> 38:48.035
Wow, you're playing a hero?

38:48.660 --> 38:51.496
Whether you like it or not,
I was her only friend

38:51.496 --> 38:54.541
Alright,
so I didn't hang out with her

38:54.833 --> 38:57.419
but at least,
I didn't manipulate her

38:57.627 --> 38:59.379
Do you have a conscience?

38:59.713 --> 39:02.007
To tell you the truth,
Cheon-ji was hard to get close to

39:02.341 --> 39:06.261
but do you know
what your nickname is?

39:06.928 --> 39:10.140
'Free wallet'

39:10.515 --> 39:13.435
You always buy things for us
and pay for karaoke

39:13.977 --> 39:16.188
Popcorn's always on you
when we go to the movies

39:22.819 --> 39:26.239
You didn't say a word
when she was around

39:27.532 --> 39:29.826
Now I'm the only bitch?

39:31.745 --> 39:36.917
I'm gonna tell Man-ji that
Cheon-ji was an outcast

39:38.001 --> 39:41.171
I have the conversation history
of our group chat room as proof

39:42.214 --> 39:45.884
You're all accomplices

39:58.397 --> 39:59.815
That's mine

40:02.776 --> 40:03.985
Get out of here

40:08.615 --> 40:10.409
- Cheon-ji is coming, too?
- Yeah

40:10.492 --> 40:12.411
Why do you care about her?

40:13.120 --> 40:15.831
I feel sorry for her

40:16.081 --> 40:18.959
Her father died when she was little
Suicide, you know?

40:19.167 --> 40:20.502
Really?

40:21.920 --> 40:23.922
That's why she is so somber

40:24.005 --> 40:27.801
I think I heard
that somewhere, too

40:28.176 --> 40:29.636
Let's refer to her as
'my sister'

40:29.636 --> 40:31.763
We don't want to upset
her father's ghost

40:31.847 --> 40:32.973
Okay

40:33.223 --> 40:37.769
My mom doesn't like Cheon...
I mean 'my sister' either

40:37.769 --> 40:40.021
She's smart and pretty

40:40.105 --> 40:41.773
but her family
must be quite gloomy

40:41.773 --> 40:43.650
Let's all be nice to
'my sister,' okay?

40:43.650 --> 40:46.778
We don't pick on people for no reason
I hate that

40:46.778 --> 40:48.029
You're right

40:52.284 --> 40:54.453
There you are
Take a seat

41:01.376 --> 41:02.711
You're late

41:03.712 --> 41:05.464
Wasn't it three o'clock?

41:08.091 --> 41:10.635
I must have written '3'
instead of '2' by mistake

41:11.595 --> 41:12.721
Sorry

41:13.638 --> 41:15.140
'My sister' must be upset

41:15.140 --> 41:17.267
<i>Didn't she come at three last year, too?</i>
- 'My sister' showed up late 
- No more talks  about 'my sister,' okay?

41:17.267 --> 41:19.478
- 'My sister' showed up late
- No more talks about 'my sister,' okay?

41:19.895 --> 41:22.189
We're just talking about
our sisters

41:22.314 --> 41:25.192
You have a sister, too
What's she like?

41:25.817 --> 41:29.070
She's cool

41:29.237 --> 41:31.656
<i>Order a black bean noodles for her</i>

41:31.990 --> 41:34.618
Mom, can we get
a black bean noodles?

41:37.370 --> 41:39.122
Where's my present?

41:40.040 --> 41:41.875
What did say you wanted?

41:42.042 --> 41:43.752
MP3 player

41:44.002 --> 41:47.255
I'm sorry I forgot

41:48.298 --> 41:53.637
I'm kidding!
Who cares about presents?

41:55.764 --> 41:57.641
I was gonna get your present

41:57.974 --> 42:01.102
but this is just
an early birthday party, right?

42:01.353 --> 42:03.188
I'll give it to you
on your real birthday

42:03.647 --> 42:04.731
Thanks

42:04.814 --> 42:05.815
Here

42:07.484 --> 42:08.777
Thank you, Mrs. Kim

42:09.945 --> 42:12.739
We're all going to karaoke
after this. Are you coming?

42:14.074 --> 42:15.867
I have to study

42:16.660 --> 42:18.036
You have to study

42:18.662 --> 42:23.583
I did invite you, okay?
You can't say I left you out later

42:36.137 --> 42:38.723
<i>Look at her gobbling up
that noodle</i>

43:16.469 --> 43:18.221
How is Man-ji?

43:19.848 --> 43:21.182
What about her?

43:21.808 --> 43:24.686
It was Hwa-yeon

43:25.103 --> 43:27.188
Did something happen between
you and Hwa-yeon?

43:27.480 --> 43:29.441
She picked on Cheon-ji
all the time

43:29.524 --> 43:31.943
You didn't like Cheon-ji
very much either

43:32.444 --> 43:35.905
She pretended not to know
that she was being bullied

43:36.197 --> 43:37.407
I hated that more

43:38.742 --> 43:40.535
Don't say that about her

43:41.119 --> 43:46.124
Be honest. You didn't want to be
friends with Cheon-ji but then, she died

43:46.916 --> 43:50.086
You feel guilty. So, you're
blaming Hwa-yeon for everything

43:52.088 --> 43:54.299
Did you bully her, too?

43:55.425 --> 43:56.968
I was one of the nicer ones

43:56.968 --> 44:01.348
Everyone in your class
just ignored her

44:01.723 --> 44:03.141
And you were one of them

44:03.433 --> 44:06.853
Only the wrong people
end up dying!

44:07.646 --> 44:09.689
People like dad live

44:11.441 --> 44:13.026
while mom had to die

44:26.414 --> 44:30.835
The smell's killing me
Bring me my ramen

44:36.716 --> 44:40.178
The fucking loser
can't kick the ball

44:40.470 --> 44:44.265
It's right in front of you, idiot

44:52.691 --> 44:55.527
Stop smacking your mouth
You're disgusting

44:55.527 --> 44:56.903
I can hear you, bitch

45:01.741 --> 45:05.704
Mi-ra needs to go to cram school

45:05.870 --> 45:08.164
They don't have teachers
in middle school?

45:09.666 --> 45:11.084
Did you get the certificate?

45:11.167 --> 45:12.669
It's my goddamn business

45:14.129 --> 45:15.380
It's me

45:17.340 --> 45:19.259
Of course, I'm in

45:19.843 --> 45:22.887
The dumb ass loses every time
and still wants in?

45:28.059 --> 45:29.728
Sorry I yelled at you

45:30.687 --> 45:32.063
It's okay

45:32.814 --> 45:34.357
I'm going
Thanks for the ramen

45:51.666 --> 45:57.213
Pick up the damn phone, woman
You wanna kill yourself, too?

45:57.255 --> 46:01.217
I know that woman

46:01.593 --> 46:02.761
What?

46:03.636 --> 46:05.305
The woman that dad is seeing

46:06.222 --> 46:09.058
- Shall I pay a visit to your school?
- It's okay, uncle

46:09.559 --> 46:12.562
Don't tell mom, though

46:12.937 --> 46:15.982
I swear if it happens again...

46:19.944 --> 46:21.070
This is good

46:21.446 --> 46:22.781
What a handsome boy!

46:23.948 --> 46:25.200
Thank you

46:25.533 --> 46:28.745
These bullies pick on him
during lunch hours

46:28.745 --> 46:30.830
and the ten-minute breaks

46:30.955 --> 46:37.462
And the school's solution is
to install more surveillance cameras

46:39.589 --> 46:41.883
Have some fried tofu

46:42.300 --> 46:43.301
Thank you

46:43.384 --> 46:45.136
How polite you are!

46:48.598 --> 46:50.975
Here's some pocket money for you

46:50.975 --> 46:52.477
50 dollars?
That's too much

46:52.727 --> 46:54.395
It's okay
You can take it

46:57.816 --> 46:59.609
Can I ask you a favor instead?

47:03.696 --> 47:06.449
Tell your mom about it

47:08.201 --> 47:10.662
Or I'll tell to her

47:22.841 --> 47:24.217
Are you going to
cram school tonight?

47:24.300 --> 47:25.343
No

47:26.052 --> 47:29.347
Come round my place for dinner
Your eyes have sunken

47:29.764 --> 47:33.601
We're both busy with housework
Let's not bother with dinner invitations

47:33.685 --> 47:35.019
I'll pretend I had it

47:35.353 --> 47:38.189
We need to talk
It's about our parents

47:39.524 --> 47:42.402
Supper's ready
Come on, Mi-ra

47:45.363 --> 47:48.533
I can deal with no eggs
inglass noodles

47:48.533 --> 47:50.159
but no fish cake in spicy rice cakes
is just unacceptable

47:50.159 --> 47:51.703
It's good... try it

47:51.870 --> 47:54.247
I only eat fish cakes
inspicy rice cakes

47:55.206 --> 47:56.416
It's good

47:57.584 --> 48:01.796
Never been treated as a guest before
This feels great

48:03.172 --> 48:04.799
Now talk to me

48:10.263 --> 48:13.850
Isn't your mom seeing someone?

48:14.142 --> 48:17.604
She did
He turns out to be a jerk

48:18.646 --> 48:20.481
I think she ended it

48:22.025 --> 48:24.235
That jerk was my dad

48:25.111 --> 48:28.072
I wasn't really curious
but it was your dad, huh?

48:28.114 --> 48:29.198
You're not surprised?

48:29.282 --> 48:32.118
You gave all the hints

48:33.077 --> 48:38.875
My mom never knew about your mom
He told her that he was widowed

48:39.375 --> 48:40.960
So, don't hate her so much

48:42.503 --> 48:44.172
Bastard...

48:48.426 --> 48:50.261
Why are you looking at me
like that?

48:51.012 --> 48:54.182
You're so different from Cheon-ji

48:55.099 --> 48:56.935
How?

48:58.102 --> 48:59.437
Just... a lot

49:03.232 --> 49:06.319
Didn't Cheon-ji say anything
about me?

49:06.778 --> 49:08.988
I didn't know she had a sister

49:09.113 --> 49:11.366
And I didn't know you were
friends with my sister

49:12.784 --> 49:15.119
It's worse that hearing
she said shit about me

49:16.913 --> 49:18.831
Did she know
about our mom and dad?

49:21.626 --> 49:23.294
Hey! You alright?

49:23.378 --> 49:26.214
Cheon-ji doesn't know about my dad

49:26.839 --> 49:29.467
was too ashamed
to tell her about him

49:30.301 --> 49:31.344
You okay?

49:31.469 --> 49:34.097
I wasted good food

49:34.514 --> 49:35.807
It's okay
There's plenty

49:41.562 --> 49:43.481
I'm sorry
in the middle of eating

49:45.525 --> 49:49.487
and it tastes really good
without the fish cakes...

49:51.280 --> 49:53.282
but I gotta go

49:54.117 --> 49:57.120
- Let me see you out
- No, it's okay

50:03.001 --> 50:07.839
There's this girl in my class
who gets bullied

50:09.007 --> 50:10.842
I don't understand why

50:11.676 --> 50:14.679
There's always a reason

50:16.889 --> 50:22.562
You're so prickly and yet,
you have so many friends

50:23.104 --> 50:24.605
I don't have many friends

50:27.400 --> 50:32.030
Don't you have a friend
who talks behind your back?

50:32.989 --> 50:35.867
Don't be friends with
someone like that

50:38.369 --> 50:43.541
What if she is
the only friend you've got?

50:44.208 --> 50:46.502
Then, just stick to yourself

50:50.048 --> 50:53.676
Who would I hang out with then?

51:08.566 --> 51:09.692
Mom,

51:12.195 --> 51:15.031
I think I was a terrible sister

51:18.034 --> 51:20.078
I was a terrible mom

51:22.497 --> 51:28.252
She reached out to me
loud and clear

51:29.629 --> 51:31.089
But I just...

51:34.926 --> 51:36.427
Listen

51:37.136 --> 51:40.765
This is not
what Cheon-ji wants

51:44.644 --> 51:50.525
But I have to know
what tormented her

51:51.943 --> 51:55.780
I can't move on
without the answer

52:11.129 --> 52:12.463
Lift your feet

52:15.383 --> 52:17.051
You're not going to school?

52:18.511 --> 52:22.056
Can I skip school?
I have a stomachache

52:22.056 --> 52:24.308
Don't be silly
Come on

52:28.646 --> 52:31.357
I forgot it was my friend's birthday
Can I get 20 dollars?

52:31.732 --> 52:34.318
<i>Oh, sure...</i>

52:34.443 --> 52:38.114
You forgot!
So, here's your money

52:38.781 --> 52:42.326
I wish I was my daughter, too

52:42.410 --> 52:46.497
I give you money for friends' birthdays
and because you have to go somewhere

52:46.497 --> 52:48.166
It's just 20 dollars

52:48.624 --> 52:53.045
We need to talk about that girl
What's her name...

52:55.339 --> 52:56.674
I heard she died

52:58.759 --> 53:02.013
I had a phone call
from your cram school

53:02.513 --> 53:06.851
They said they can't keep you
because you were bullying people

53:08.394 --> 53:10.688
Cram schools are business, too

53:10.688 --> 53:14.150
When they ask
a paying customer to leave,

53:14.233 --> 53:15.693
it must be for a serious reason

53:15.860 --> 53:17.862
How come you're always
on others' side?

53:18.821 --> 53:21.407
Aren't I your daughter?

53:21.532 --> 53:23.618
I'm on the side of
whoever is right

53:24.202 --> 53:27.538
How can I take the side of a daughter
who burns a hole in someone's heart?

53:31.375 --> 53:32.376
Hey

53:32.877 --> 53:34.879
Ungrateful brat

53:35.421 --> 53:38.883
<i>5:30pm, Queen's Karaoke
I'm treating</i>

53:50.186 --> 53:51.479
Shall we get this one together?

53:51.479 --> 53:52.855
Yeah, for the two of us

54:00.154 --> 54:02.531
<i>For the first three to arrive!</i>

54:34.939 --> 54:39.235
What are you doing here?

54:39.860 --> 54:42.780
I was asked to sit in
for a few hours... hi!

54:46.242 --> 54:48.327
Can you hang out with me?

54:51.122 --> 54:52.415
Doing what?

54:54.500 --> 54:55.876
Just talk

54:59.463 --> 55:01.590
I don't see you
with Cheon-ji these days

55:02.550 --> 55:04.927
She died...
she killed herself

55:04.927 --> 55:06.012
What?

55:08.347 --> 55:11.642
How do you know her?

55:12.852 --> 55:14.645
So, it was true

55:17.815 --> 55:19.817
She's dead

55:21.694 --> 55:22.862
Cheon-ji...

55:22.945 --> 55:27.158
I'm asking you
How do you know her name?

55:33.331 --> 55:36.292
I used to run into her
from time to time at the library

55:38.169 --> 55:41.672
She liked to talk
So, we talked about stuff

55:42.048 --> 55:43.674
or grabbed a bite to eat

55:44.175 --> 55:46.761
She hated to talk

55:53.351 --> 55:56.103
I guess she
was different around you

55:56.395 --> 55:59.190
She said her sister's name
was Man-ji

56:00.191 --> 56:03.027
And the girl who moved next door
is called Man-ji

56:05.696 --> 56:09.700
They seemed very different
yet, looked so much alike

56:11.369 --> 56:13.579
So, I wondered where Cheon-ji was

56:15.706 --> 56:17.083
Why did she do it?

56:17.208 --> 56:19.293
When was the last time
you saw her?

56:22.380 --> 56:24.632
At the library. She was preparing
for her presentation assignment

56:26.717 --> 56:32.723
I forgot something
I gotta go

56:36.060 --> 56:38.562
<i>I wish there was a air freshener
for the mind</i>

56:38.687 --> 56:40.606
<i>Cheer up, Lee Cheon-ji!</i>

56:47.029 --> 56:50.032
- Hello?
- <i>It's Hwa-yeon</i>

56:50.241 --> 56:53.911
<i>There a guy next door
with a long hair? Be careful</i>

56:54.120 --> 56:56.664
He used to know Cheon-ji

56:57.289 --> 56:58.207
So what?

56:58.249 --> 57:02.545
<i>I saw her with him when
she came by my house</i>

57:03.045 --> 57:07.591
I just said hello and
didn't think much of it

57:08.050 --> 57:11.345
but apparently, they used to
meet secretly at the library

57:12.430 --> 57:14.223
Is that another one of your plots?

57:14.306 --> 57:16.142
<i>If that's how you want to see it</i>

57:16.767 --> 57:18.769
I'm just telling you
what happened

57:20.438 --> 57:21.981
Why are you telling me this now?

57:22.273 --> 57:23.774
<i>I saw him today</i>

57:23.858 --> 57:27.069
and he said 'Man-ji and
Cheon-ji are sister, right?'

57:27.528 --> 57:31.073
<i>I thought he was just a freak
but there's something about him</i>

57:31.282 --> 57:34.535
<i>And I wasn't gonna say this but...</i>

57:35.286 --> 57:39.999
They met the day before
Cheon-ji killed herself

57:40.791 --> 57:44.670
<i>May be she had a secret
that she couldn't tell anyone</i>

57:52.636 --> 57:53.846
Hello?

57:58.142 --> 57:59.435
Chu Sangbak

58:08.736 --> 58:11.906
Mom, do you think...

58:12.573 --> 58:13.866
What?

58:15.201 --> 58:18.829
We don't know if something
horrible happened to Cheon-ji

58:20.414 --> 58:22.958
like assault...

58:23.250 --> 58:27.296
Are you talking about
sexual crime?

58:29.548 --> 58:31.175
It didn't happen

58:31.675 --> 58:34.637
How can you be sure?
What if she couldn't tell us?

58:35.763 --> 58:37.181
What if she was pregnant?

58:37.264 --> 58:39.725
She didn't even have period

58:40.059 --> 58:44.396
Oh... you're right but what if...

58:44.480 --> 58:47.024
What kind of supposition is that?

58:49.026 --> 58:50.528
Did you hear something?

58:50.611 --> 58:53.364
No, I just wondered

58:53.572 --> 58:58.035
If there was a man, I would know
Mothers know

58:58.369 --> 59:00.079
It didn't happen to her
Not to Cheon-ji

59:00.788 --> 59:03.207
What if something like that
happened to me...

59:03.207 --> 59:05.834
What's wrong with
your goddamn 'what if's'?

59:07.294 --> 59:09.380
If anything like that happened,

59:11.924 --> 59:13.342
I would

59:17.263 --> 59:19.390
shred that bastard to pieces

59:31.902 --> 59:33.195
Loan record?

59:33.445 --> 59:38.158
I'm doing this for my sister and
want to make sure there's no overlap

59:38.158 --> 59:39.910
I see...
Please give me that

59:47.376 --> 59:49.461
<i>Depression can be treated
Psychology of depression...</i>

59:49.461 --> 59:51.463
<i>Sick child
Overcoming depression...</i>

01:00:02.850 --> 01:00:04.518
- What are you doing here?
- Huh?

01:00:06.604 --> 01:00:07.563
Hi, Man-ji

01:00:07.605 --> 01:00:10.941
Did I scare you?
Did you do something wrong?

01:00:11.442 --> 01:00:14.028
I was thinking about something

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:20.618
So, you knew Cheon-ji?

01:00:24.538 --> 01:00:26.498
I heard... I'm sorry

01:00:35.382 --> 01:00:36.967
Why are you looking at me
like that?

01:00:38.302 --> 01:00:40.095
You think my hair's funny, too?

01:00:43.474 --> 01:00:44.683
Are you crazy?

01:00:44.683 --> 01:00:45.726
I just uh...

01:00:49.063 --> 01:00:51.357
Cheon-ji used to nag at me
to cut my hair

01:00:51.357 --> 01:00:53.108
but I never showed her this

01:00:55.277 --> 01:00:56.362
You can take a look for her

01:00:56.362 --> 01:00:58.572
What happened?

01:00:59.782 --> 01:01:05.537
There was a fire when I was little
Goes all the way down the back

01:01:06.872 --> 01:01:10.959
My nickname was a monster

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:15.673
I left school and
started growing my hair

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.300
I'm sorry

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:30.688
So, you used to hang out with her
What did you talk about?

01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:35.025
She hated studying

01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:36.944
She loved studying

01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:40.072
No, she hated it

01:01:40.155 --> 01:01:43.325
Why do you work so hard
if you hate studying?

01:01:43.659 --> 01:01:47.621
People don't believe you
unless you have good grades

01:01:48.205 --> 01:01:52.209
Otherwise, your words just
get disintegrated in the air

01:01:53.419 --> 01:01:55.379
Maybe I talked too much

01:01:55.587 --> 01:01:59.633
No, please
Anything else?

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:02.386
What are you reading?

01:02:02.803 --> 01:02:04.012
Hi

01:02:07.808 --> 01:02:09.560
Overcoming depression?

01:02:09.727 --> 01:02:17.735
There's this girl in my class
I'll give her the list of symptoms

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:21.530
If she acts opposite to the list,
no one will suspect her

01:02:22.322 --> 01:02:24.116
Why would she do that?

01:02:24.867 --> 01:02:32.332
Her friends will leave her
if they find out she's depressed

01:02:32.875 --> 01:02:35.753
She hid her depression...
for some lousy friends?

01:02:39.047 --> 01:02:41.925
People who have friends naturally
don't understand

01:02:43.427 --> 01:02:49.600
At her age, friends make up
half of their entire world

01:02:51.769 --> 01:02:55.230
How close were you
with my sister?

01:02:55.314 --> 01:02:58.317
How can you know the things
that even a family didn't know?

01:02:58.984 --> 01:03:05.115
Sometimes, you speak
your heart out to strangers

01:03:06.617 --> 01:03:10.537
Stranger don't dwell
on your secrets

01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:14.958
I was that stranger to her

01:03:17.795 --> 01:03:20.923
Where was I all that time...?

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:25.844
Don't be hard on yourself
Families aren't supposed to know

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:33.268
Not knowing everything
helps you stick together for life

01:03:33.685 --> 01:03:40.359
What kind of will is no will?

01:03:42.486 --> 01:03:45.322
Is it 'don't ask'?

01:03:45.906 --> 01:03:48.283
Or 'please hear me out...'

01:03:50.494 --> 01:03:53.956
It kills me
because I don't know

01:03:58.836 --> 01:04:01.713
Didn't I make the perfect
eggs this morning?

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:04.508
I hated uncooked yolk

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:07.219
- Just have it, will you?
- I said no

01:04:08.095 --> 01:04:11.890
God... where did you get
that coldness from?

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:20.315
Cheon-ji was always lovely
She always knew how I felt

01:04:22.317 --> 01:04:25.153
Why didn't you be nice to her
while she was around?

01:04:26.697 --> 01:04:27.614
What?

01:04:27.614 --> 01:04:32.578
We didn't pay attention
when she was struggling

01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:41.044
They say you bury your child
in your heart

01:04:41.545 --> 01:04:44.631
but I think you just
put it all behind you

01:04:46.842 --> 01:04:48.343
What could I do?

01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:54.892
You can pour cement and
smelting iron over it

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:58.645
You still can't put it
behind you

01:04:58.729 --> 01:05:01.982
You can never bury them
because you feel sorry

01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:03.692
and because you can't forget

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:08.071
Don't eat the damn eggs

01:05:16.496 --> 01:05:17.998
How can I help you?

01:05:18.123 --> 01:05:20.500
- How can I help you?
- How can I help you?

01:05:20.584 --> 01:05:22.085
Yes, ma'am... sir

01:05:22.169 --> 01:05:24.296
- Yes, ma'am... sir
- Yes, ma'am... sir

01:05:24.379 --> 01:05:26.590
Enjoy Shopping with us

01:05:26.715 --> 01:05:29.217
- Enjoy shopping with us
- Enjoy shopping with us

01:05:29.217 --> 01:05:30.928
Smile, everyone

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:33.013
- Smile
- Smile

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:42.898
Ma'am, have a taste of fresh tofu

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.032
What are you doing here?

01:05:52.783 --> 01:05:54.826
I was just passing

01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:57.913
Why were passing here?

01:05:57.996 --> 01:05:59.873
Why not?

01:06:02.793 --> 01:06:06.672
Hey, 'Dumpling'! Boil some
dumplings for my daughter?

01:06:07.422 --> 01:06:11.093
I just put everything away
Can't you just fry some tofu?

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:14.429
I want dumplings
Just do it

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:16.306
Oh, come on

01:06:18.392 --> 01:06:20.769
How do I look?

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:24.022
Pretty

01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:27.150
It's little too big

01:06:28.235 --> 01:06:30.404
Man-ji said I have to wear it
until I graduate

01:06:30.821 --> 01:06:32.322
What if you don't grow big?

01:06:33.031 --> 01:06:34.366
I hope I will

01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:43.875
Shall we call Man-ji and
get dinner together? Sushi?

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:49.798
- <i>What?</i>
- Where <i>are you?</i>

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.174
<i>I'm busy. Gotta go</i>

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:57.014
I would've frozen to death
if it wasn't for you

01:06:57.848 --> 01:07:01.143
How pretty you are!
I heard you're top of the class

01:07:01.393 --> 01:07:03.103
Your mom can't stop
bragging about you

01:07:03.395 --> 01:07:05.856
- Here you go, princess
- Thank you

01:07:05.856 --> 01:07:09.401
Your mom's in a good mood
You can tell her anything you want

01:07:11.445 --> 01:07:14.573
I want her to stop being lonely

01:07:19.578 --> 01:07:21.955
Maybe I should start dating again

01:07:22.289 --> 01:07:23.999
I'm totally supportive of that

01:07:25.876 --> 01:07:28.336
Aren't you the sweetest

01:07:28.754 --> 01:07:32.090
Come on, there's gotta
be something you want?

01:07:32.507 --> 01:07:34.051
What I want?

01:07:39.765 --> 01:07:41.349
A chair for her

01:07:47.689 --> 01:07:51.485
Let's get some tampons
I know you've been stealing from me

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:53.403
That's fine
Just come home early

01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:57.741
I'll stay up

01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:04.831
Man-ji...

01:08:05.624 --> 01:08:07.959
you touch my heart
when I didn't expect

01:08:15.509 --> 01:08:18.303
I don't know
It happens outside my door

01:08:18.386 --> 01:08:22.474
Only our plates are stolen

01:08:23.642 --> 01:08:26.728
Are you accusing me?

01:08:26.812 --> 01:08:30.064
I ordered from you
because we're neighbors

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:33.944
It's just that... for some reason,
our plates have been going missing

01:08:34.027 --> 01:08:36.779
We get tons of complaints
about our food, too

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:39.198
What would I do with
your delivery plates?

01:08:40.158 --> 01:08:42.536
They make great flowerpot holders

01:08:42.536 --> 01:08:44.287
I don't keep any plant
in my apartment

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:45.913
I'm sorry

01:08:45.956 --> 01:08:48.959
I'm worried about customers
dropping out by the dozens

01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:51.252
Who's stealing the delivery plates?

01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:53.796
That's the least of our concern

01:08:54.005 --> 01:08:58.551
There is a rumor that we use
rotten ingredients

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:00.470
Who's been saying such things?

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.389
I think I might know

01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:09.520
I love eating dumplings
and feeding them to others

01:09:11.356 --> 01:09:13.149
Oh dear

01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:21.658
- Really?
- Why won't people buy more dumplings?

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.076
It's really good

01:09:23.076 --> 01:09:25.537
It makes a perfect
healthy snack for everyone

01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:43.220
Mom, I don't feel well

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:44.430
Where?

01:09:45.599 --> 01:09:50.145
My stomach hurts
Can I skip school today?

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:54.024
You have to go to school anyway

01:09:54.482 --> 01:09:57.694
If it gets really bad,
go to the nurse's office

01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:02.157
How come you always
lose your gym uniforms?

01:10:03.825 --> 01:10:05.076
Yes, speaking

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:09.539
<i>I don't know if this is appropriate
but there's a girl called Hwa-yeon</i>

01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:12.167
<i>who seems to pick on Cheon-ji</i>

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:14.252
<i>Maybe it's best to pull them apart</i>

01:10:14.252 --> 01:10:15.503
I see

01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:19.216
Let the kids sort it out
between themselves

01:10:21.343 --> 01:10:25.513
You should raise your child
to be clever, not cunning

01:10:26.056 --> 01:10:27.557
What?

01:10:27.849 --> 01:10:31.811
It's your fault that
you raised yours meek

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:35.523
Please leave, I'm busy

01:10:39.361 --> 01:10:42.572
Shall we order black bean noodles
for dinner?

01:10:44.282 --> 01:10:48.870
I hate black bean noodles
more than anything in the world

01:10:49.412 --> 01:10:54.292
Okay...
let's boil some ramen then

01:10:54.668 --> 01:11:00.298
I'll die because of
black bean noodles

01:11:18.650 --> 01:11:19.859
Mom

01:11:21.611 --> 01:11:23.113
What's wrong?

01:11:27.826 --> 01:11:29.160
Mom?

01:11:31.913 --> 01:11:34.958
God, you're boiling!
Wait for me, okay?

01:11:42.257 --> 01:11:43.550
Hello?

01:11:45.593 --> 01:11:47.929
Hello, is anyone there?

01:11:52.851 --> 01:11:55.812
Are you alright?

01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:58.898
I'm okay

01:12:00.859 --> 01:12:02.152
You sure?

01:12:02.152 --> 01:12:03.320
Yeah

01:12:05.447 --> 01:12:07.615
What are you doing here?

01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:11.244
Why couldn't you
find this yourself?

01:12:14.331 --> 01:12:15.749
Look in there

01:12:16.041 --> 01:12:17.083
What?

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:21.546
There is a note
that Cheon-ji left

01:12:34.476 --> 01:12:37.062
<i>My dearest sister
who I've always envied</i>

01:12:37.437 --> 01:12:40.940
<i>Don't forget me even if
I go to a faraway place</i>

01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:43.193
<i>I love you, sis</i>

01:12:44.194 --> 01:12:47.405
<i>Second of five sealed yarns</i>

01:12:49.949 --> 01:12:51.701
Why didn't you tell me?

01:12:52.035 --> 01:12:54.037
I'm telling you now

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.876
It's the second one of five

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:02.796
It means there are more

01:13:07.592 --> 01:13:09.302
Because I didn't have this...

01:13:18.395 --> 01:13:22.190
Thank you, Cheon-ji

01:13:23.942 --> 01:13:25.193
Cheonji

01:13:35.328 --> 01:13:36.913
Can I get a black bean noodle?

01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:39.833
One black noodle for here

01:13:42.168 --> 01:13:45.839
It's pretty quiet
Maybe because it's a weekday

01:13:46.714 --> 01:13:50.343
With this economy,
it's no different in the weekend

01:13:52.595 --> 01:13:56.933
I just moved and I didn't
come around to say hello properly

01:14:11.489 --> 01:14:13.199
Have a drink?

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:15.410
Why not

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:26.504
I heard about what happened

01:14:27.255 --> 01:14:31.801
I sit here all day but
news carries itself here

01:14:36.139 --> 01:14:38.057
You must be devastated

01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:43.646
but maybe it wasn't her fate
to have a long life

01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:48.860
I think her destined life
was average

01:14:50.445 --> 01:14:52.947
until someone shortened it for her

01:15:01.414 --> 01:15:03.041
I came to give you this

01:15:06.878 --> 01:15:10.173
My daughter wanted to
give this to Hwa-yeon

01:15:10.924 --> 01:15:16.971
It would've been nice
if she could give it herself

01:15:18.348 --> 01:15:20.600
I hope your daughter likes it

01:15:24.062 --> 01:15:26.105
The noodle's on the house

01:15:26.105 --> 01:15:28.858
- No, thank you
- Cheon-ji's mom...

01:15:28.858 --> 01:15:31.319
Don't!
If you're going to apologize

01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:37.158
An apology in words

01:15:41.037 --> 01:15:43.915
is acceptable only
when you can forgive

01:15:44.249 --> 01:15:46.459
If you get an apology
you can't accept

01:15:51.381 --> 01:15:53.132
it'll only stab you in the heart

01:15:54.509 --> 01:16:00.557
Especially when I have
no intention of hearing

01:16:02.475 --> 01:16:07.564
It's just a convenient excuse
for you to hide behind

01:16:08.231 --> 01:16:11.234
'I apologized but
she didn't accept it'

01:16:14.404 --> 01:16:16.406
That's what you're gonna say

01:16:28.251 --> 01:16:33.381
I'm sorry but I can't
pass this to my daughter

01:17:08.166 --> 01:17:13.171
Now you know
why I moved here

01:17:16.633 --> 01:17:19.510
I want you to look at my face
for the rest of your lives

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:45.703
Chinese restaurant

01:17:46.287 --> 01:17:50.500
Oh, hello... sorry?

01:17:52.543 --> 01:17:59.050
Hwa-yeon fell ill
So, she's taking a rest at home

01:17:59.133 --> 01:18:02.053
I'll send her as soon
ass he feels betters

01:18:02.178 --> 01:18:10.353
Please understand
if she acts strangely

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:15.525
The dead girl's mother
moved here on purpose

01:18:17.527 --> 01:18:19.278
Of course, she can't have

01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:22.907
Okay... thank you

01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:27.120
Was that her teacher?
She skipped school?

01:18:28.079 --> 01:18:31.999
How can you be so uninterested?

01:18:32.083 --> 01:18:35.461
She's so full of silly thoughts
in her head

01:18:35.461 --> 01:18:37.046
I'm gonna teach her a lesson

01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:40.341
Will you just shut up?

01:18:46.264 --> 01:18:47.640
Oh, God!

01:19:06.117 --> 01:19:08.286
<i>You used to knit</i>

01:19:08.661 --> 01:19:10.246
This is for you

01:19:13.124 --> 01:19:15.418
How are you feeling?

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:17.336
Better

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:27.180
Shall we start?

01:19:28.514 --> 01:19:30.600
It's still break time

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:33.519
Alright...
I'll just leave the books here

01:19:33.603 --> 01:19:36.230
I wanted to spend more
time with you, that's all

01:19:37.774 --> 01:19:38.858
Miss Lee

01:19:39.025 --> 01:19:39.942
Yes'?

01:19:40.026 --> 01:19:44.906
I'm not feeling well
Can I sit in the front?

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:48.117
Who wants to switch seats
for Hwa-yeon?

01:19:48.743 --> 01:19:50.244
I will

01:19:50.536 --> 01:19:54.081
Okay, I'll see you
when the break is over

01:19:57.627 --> 01:20:00.671
Thanks...
This is for you

01:20:10.515 --> 01:20:11.933
What are you making?

01:20:12.308 --> 01:20:13.976
A sitting mat

01:20:13.976 --> 01:20:15.478
Will you make one for me?

01:20:15.853 --> 01:20:17.230
Are you crazy?

01:20:24.445 --> 01:20:26.989
- Where are you going?
- She's upset because of you

01:20:26.989 --> 01:20:28.616
What did I do?

01:20:29.283 --> 01:20:33.412
Oh, forget it

01:20:36.249 --> 01:20:38.167
Did we have homework
for this class?

01:20:39.627 --> 01:20:42.046
Why come all the way here
to ask that?

01:20:46.384 --> 01:20:48.678
Wanna go to the restroom with me?

01:20:48.928 --> 01:20:52.515
No, Mi-so had to move
because of you

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:55.101
I'm sorry but
I couldn't see the board

01:20:55.184 --> 01:20:58.020
It's always the dumb ones
that complain about the board

01:21:07.071 --> 01:21:10.032
I can't take it anymore
I should go home

01:21:23.504 --> 01:21:26.048
- Talk to her for me?
- Yes, miss

01:21:26.299 --> 01:21:27.925
Okay

01:21:34.765 --> 01:21:37.894
That's my yarn, miss

01:21:40.438 --> 01:21:42.231
Don't knit during the class

01:21:42.356 --> 01:21:46.986
I wasn't
I just had it out on the desk

01:21:47.486 --> 01:21:48.738
Is it a scarf?

01:21:49.655 --> 01:21:52.575
Just a wide plane

01:21:52.742 --> 01:21:54.285
Alright, you can go now

01:22:11.969 --> 01:22:14.263
So, you're just knitting
a square shape?

01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:19.101
Did Miss Lee ask you
to talk to me?

01:22:19.143 --> 01:22:22.063
No... to Miso

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:25.066
I guess it's something
the teachers can see

01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:29.946
But I don't want to
She'll just snap at me

01:22:31.864 --> 01:22:38.204
So, your this class'
Miss Congeniality?

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:41.624
Only because I'm average
in every aspect

01:22:41.999 --> 01:22:45.628
Not pretty, not bright,
not rich...

01:22:47.964 --> 01:22:50.716
I liked your answer
'Just a square'?

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:59.767
I keep knitting a wide plane
until I feel it's enough

01:23:00.226 --> 01:23:01.644
Then I undo it

01:23:03.187 --> 01:23:04.647
Is this wide enough

01:23:05.690 --> 01:23:07.733
More or less

01:23:08.484 --> 01:23:10.820
Then, let's undo it
Can I?

01:24:14.717 --> 01:24:16.052
What's this place?

01:24:17.344 --> 01:24:19.138
Just where the red wool led us

01:24:20.681 --> 01:24:23.517
You didn't know you had a smile

01:24:24.894 --> 01:24:26.479
I smile a lot

01:24:27.354 --> 01:24:28.481
Alright

01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:44.080
I love this place
Can I come everyday?

01:24:45.748 --> 01:24:47.249
Of course

01:24:56.133 --> 01:24:57.426
Like this?

01:24:57.843 --> 01:24:58.761
Like this

01:25:18.447 --> 01:25:21.784
I'm telling the truth
This time, she's really dead

01:25:21.784 --> 01:25:23.953
Go to hell

01:25:25.079 --> 01:25:28.457
No, you just had your punishment
now that your wife's gone

01:25:28.541 --> 01:25:31.627
That's what I keep telling you
She's really dead

01:25:31.752 --> 01:25:34.463
You're a lot bigger jerk
than I thought

01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:36.298
Get out of my sight

01:25:38.092 --> 01:25:39.802
Hey

01:25:40.177 --> 01:25:41.512
I'm serious...

01:25:43.806 --> 01:25:47.059
You tormented mom
until the day she died

01:25:47.643 --> 01:25:49.270
because of someone like this?

01:25:49.353 --> 01:25:50.813
Watch it

01:25:52.398 --> 01:25:58.571
This is what I deserve
for dating a jerk?

01:26:00.865 --> 01:26:05.161
I'll let this one pass because
I sympathize with how you feel

01:26:08.122 --> 01:26:09.540
Hey!

01:26:11.167 --> 01:26:12.501
How dare you?

01:26:13.502 --> 01:26:18.174
Don't be rude
She'll be your step mom

01:26:18.841 --> 01:26:20.342
Wait! Cheon-ji's mom!

01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:27.349
Cheon-ji's... mom?

01:26:40.654 --> 01:26:45.367
Did you say that your mom
worked in GS Mart?

01:26:45.993 --> 01:26:48.913
Yeah... why?

01:26:49.538 --> 01:26:50.956
Nothing

01:26:53.042 --> 01:26:58.547
I don't feel well from
all the potato chips

01:27:03.969 --> 01:27:06.889
I think you're mom
is dating someone

01:27:08.724 --> 01:27:12.811
I'm supportive

01:27:12.895 --> 01:27:19.193
Yeah, life must rosy for her
when the daughter's like this

01:27:19.526 --> 01:27:22.446
What do you mean by that?

01:27:22.529 --> 01:27:26.367
Stop pretending you don't know

01:27:27.243 --> 01:27:30.037
What are talking about?

01:27:30.037 --> 01:27:32.873
Why ask me when
you know damn well?

01:27:33.457 --> 01:27:37.294
By the way, it was
Miss Lee's favor

01:27:37.836 --> 01:27:42.841
to talk to you, the biggest
pathetic outcast of this class

01:27:45.261 --> 01:27:48.430
But I'm tired of it

01:27:59.275 --> 01:28:04.697
Is this the library?
I was wondering

01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:07.199
if you had a ball of red yarn
in lost and found

01:28:08.158 --> 01:28:09.660
I'll hold

01:28:10.661 --> 01:28:11.662
Were you out?

01:28:11.662 --> 01:28:14.039
It's heavy
Give me a hand

01:28:14.373 --> 01:28:17.126
You don't?

01:28:17.501 --> 01:28:19.128
I see... thank you

01:28:19.211 --> 01:28:21.171
Cheon-ji's mom

01:28:23.465 --> 01:28:25.801
Get out of here
before I call the police

01:28:25.801 --> 01:28:26.844
Who is he?

01:28:26.927 --> 01:28:28.053
Go inside

01:28:28.053 --> 01:28:29.805
You must be Man-ji

01:28:29.888 --> 01:28:31.140
What's going on?

01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:33.309
- He's nobody. Go inside
- Hi. I'm the...

01:28:33.309 --> 01:28:35.644
I'm your mom's...

01:28:35.769 --> 01:28:37.396
Your mom's what?

01:28:37.396 --> 01:28:40.107
You obviously haven't seen
my temper yet

01:28:40.274 --> 01:28:42.109
Stop talking to me like that

01:28:42.109 --> 01:28:43.944
Or what?
You'll hit me?

01:28:43.986 --> 01:28:47.489
You wanna serve time
for beating your wife, too?

01:28:49.283 --> 01:28:51.243
Don't try my temper

01:28:54.997 --> 01:28:56.332
Who the hell are you?

01:28:56.415 --> 01:28:58.000
I see you a lot, bitch...

01:28:58.667 --> 01:29:00.377
What are you a man
or a woman?

01:29:00.753 --> 01:29:02.004
A man

01:29:02.212 --> 01:29:06.175
Walk away
It's not your business

01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:09.386
Bring it on

01:29:09.386 --> 01:29:10.679
Don't

01:29:10.679 --> 01:29:12.097
Show me what you got

01:29:12.348 --> 01:29:14.016
What's wrong with you?

01:29:20.022 --> 01:29:21.857
Whoa!

01:29:25.778 --> 01:29:29.114
He's down
Hit him some more

01:29:29.114 --> 01:29:30.491
Mom!

01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:34.119
I'm sorry...
Are you okay?

01:29:34.203 --> 01:29:35.371
You bastard!

01:29:35.371 --> 01:29:37.748
Please, stop

01:29:37.748 --> 01:29:38.999
Mi-ran's father!

01:29:38.999 --> 01:29:40.417
What?

01:29:43.837 --> 01:29:46.799
Think about Mi-ran and Mi-ra
if you have the energy for this

01:29:47.174 --> 01:29:49.843
How do you know
Mi-ran and Mi-ra?

01:29:49.843 --> 01:29:52.721
Mi-ran's my best friend
and Mi-ra was Cheon-ji's

01:29:52.805 --> 01:29:56.308
And I hate the idea of you
becoming my stepdad

01:29:57.351 --> 01:30:03.690
She sure can speak her mind

01:30:04.483 --> 01:30:05.859
Man...

01:30:11.698 --> 01:30:13.200
I'm bleeding

01:30:15.411 --> 01:30:19.373
Your dad just stirred up trouble
in my house

01:30:21.291 --> 01:30:25.963
It's not like that
It's over between them

01:30:27.631 --> 01:30:28.924
Maybe that's a good idea

01:30:28.924 --> 01:30:32.344
Pack your bag and
get out of there fast

01:30:33.262 --> 01:30:34.888
Tell them to come here

01:30:36.265 --> 01:30:38.350
bring their schoolbags
and uniforms

01:30:41.979 --> 01:30:47.317
They say shit happens in life
What you saw what that shit

01:30:49.111 --> 01:30:50.946
Are you okay?

01:30:51.321 --> 01:30:54.950
As you can see, I'm fine

01:30:55.159 --> 01:30:57.578
How did you end up seeing
someone like that?

01:30:57.870 --> 01:30:59.621
You must have pretty low standards

01:31:08.797 --> 01:31:10.549
Just kidding

01:31:17.931 --> 01:31:21.059
This coffee's really good
Is it Maxim?

01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:25.772
Shall I give you a trim?
Maybe like this?

01:31:25.981 --> 01:31:26.857
What's the matter?

01:31:26.857 --> 01:31:28.400
Time for shampoo

01:31:46.168 --> 01:31:47.002
Here

01:31:48.170 --> 01:31:50.172
Thank you

01:31:50.839 --> 01:31:52.716
You haven't had a proper
homemade meal in a while

01:31:54.009 --> 01:31:57.179
It's not much but
it'll taste alright

01:32:04.770 --> 01:32:06.813
Does your dad
come home often?

01:32:07.773 --> 01:32:10.859
He doesn't seem like
the type to care

01:32:13.111 --> 01:32:15.531
You used to come to
the store I work in

01:32:15.906 --> 01:32:19.243
I could tell you're used
to grocery shopping

01:32:19.576 --> 01:32:21.870
You know, I faltered briefly

01:32:23.038 --> 01:32:24.706
thinking about you girls

01:32:24.706 --> 01:32:27.751
Shall I bite the bullet
for the sake of the girls?

01:32:30.254 --> 01:32:34.049
But after Cheon-ji passed,
I realized how silly I was

01:32:34.174 --> 01:32:36.218
I couldn't even
look after my child

01:32:39.888 --> 01:32:43.892
They say all the wrong doings of the parents
are passed down to their children

01:32:46.395 --> 01:32:49.231
I don't know how he treats you

01:32:49.273 --> 01:32:52.985
but he shouldn't have done that
to me or to your mother

01:32:53.235 --> 01:32:57.239
He doesn't know
what he's doing wrong

01:32:58.574 --> 01:33:00.826
We're doing fine on our own

01:33:01.243 --> 01:33:04.621
I know, I can see that now

01:33:05.414 --> 01:33:07.791
Your mother did a good job
raising you

01:33:08.834 --> 01:33:10.252
Come on, eat up

01:33:17.426 --> 01:33:21.054
Mi-ra, don't take the trouble
to go to other grocery store

01:33:21.305 --> 01:33:23.599
Ours is the best in this area

01:33:24.433 --> 01:33:28.770
You can't avoid or block out
someone forever by trying

01:33:28.854 --> 01:33:32.065
And there is no need to
forgive or love everyone

01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:36.778
Just let yourself feel
what you feel

01:33:41.992 --> 01:33:43.368
What's wrong, sweetie?

01:33:46.079 --> 01:33:54.421
You seem like a lot better person
than I thought, but my dad...

01:33:57.591 --> 01:34:02.346
She must be over whelmed
by a proper home cooking

01:34:04.056 --> 01:34:06.975
Eat up
Clean out your plate

01:34:11.021 --> 01:34:12.105
Mom

01:34:12.481 --> 01:34:15.525
Didn't you say you look
at the face in a man?

01:34:15.651 --> 01:34:16.693
Yeah

01:34:19.488 --> 01:34:22.032
My dad's not exactly...

01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:31.708
You guys don't know
That's the look that ruled the 80's

01:34:44.012 --> 01:34:45.222
What's this?

01:34:50.143 --> 01:34:52.104
Hwa-yeon, that crazy bitch

01:34:53.522 --> 01:34:54.856
Did Hwa-yeon give it to you?

01:34:54.856 --> 01:34:56.108
Yeah

01:34:56.692 --> 01:34:57.943
Can I have it?

01:34:58.026 --> 01:35:02.531
Whatever!
This is so annoying

01:35:05.909 --> 01:35:07.619
Hey, what brings you here?

01:35:07.828 --> 01:35:11.206
Do you have the ball of yarn
that I gave you earlier?

01:35:11.373 --> 01:35:14.334
It's probably still in my locker
Why?

01:35:14.376 --> 01:35:18.130
This note was in the yarn ball
that Cheon-ji gave Hwa-yeon

01:35:21.341 --> 01:35:23.969
You really can't be separated

01:35:28.056 --> 01:35:29.391
Where did you get this?

01:35:29.391 --> 01:35:32.811
It was in the yarn ball
that Cheon-ji gave Hwa-yeon

01:35:34.062 --> 01:35:35.605
Do you know about this?

01:35:35.897 --> 01:35:41.069
Why do you have it, not Hwa-yeon?
Where is she?

01:35:41.153 --> 01:35:43.113
She hasn't been
coming to school much

01:35:43.238 --> 01:35:46.450
So, the yarn ball you gave me...
Cheon-ji gave it to you?

01:35:54.458 --> 01:35:58.879
'A murderer in the making'
That's a warning, isn't it?

01:36:00.297 --> 01:36:02.758
Hwa-yeon won't lift an eyebrow

01:36:02.966 --> 01:36:06.595
Wasn't it fun for all of you?

01:36:09.848 --> 01:36:11.433
Are you coming, too?

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:12.809
Yeah

01:36:13.351 --> 01:36:15.270
Is there nothing
you want to ask me?

01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:23.862
If I asked you why you bully me,
you'll say you've never done that

01:36:24.112 --> 01:36:27.491
Did you bother to ask?

01:36:27.991 --> 01:36:31.578
For years, she wrote three o'clock
on your invitation,

01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:33.705
but you always show up at three

01:36:33.955 --> 01:36:38.126
You play along when you know
that 'my sister' is you

01:36:38.794 --> 01:36:42.964
You just pretended not to know
That's what scares me

01:36:43.131 --> 01:36:48.094
You and Hwa-yeon both think
that you can only keep friends

01:36:49.304 --> 01:36:51.890
by picking on someone

01:36:53.558 --> 01:36:56.478
Do it all you want

01:36:57.562 --> 01:36:59.648
I won't wince

01:37:00.023 --> 01:37:05.278
I'm different from Hwa-yeon
I have reasons

01:37:06.363 --> 01:37:10.742
But Hwa-yeon, she won't realize
until someone ends up dead

01:37:16.665 --> 01:37:20.669
Why do you always carry
that color of yarn?

01:37:26.258 --> 01:37:27.676
You...

01:37:33.682 --> 01:37:39.020
What is it that you want to see?

01:37:46.695 --> 01:37:49.698
No. Mi-ra should read it

01:37:50.282 --> 01:37:52.450
It was meant for her

01:38:06.673 --> 01:38:10.594
I'll just read it later

01:38:12.762 --> 01:38:15.724
I didn't know
I really didn't know

01:38:15.724 --> 01:38:17.100
Open it

01:38:24.065 --> 01:38:27.068
<i>Couldn't you keep some of the thing
you said to yourself?</i>

01:38:27.485 --> 01:38:30.030
<i>Sometimes the words
from your mouth</i>

01:38:30.071 --> 01:38:32.741
<i>cut deep into my heart</i>

01:38:33.158 --> 01:38:35.160
<i>but I'll forgive you</i>

01:38:35.410 --> 01:38:38.455
<i>because I remember
the first time I saw you smile</i>

01:38:43.710 --> 01:38:46.421
What did you do to her?

01:38:48.298 --> 01:38:53.511
Why'd you hit me?
I've been good to her all along

01:38:53.929 --> 01:38:57.682
while everyone pretended
as if she didn't exist

01:38:57.766 --> 01:39:02.062
But after I saw dad with her mom

01:39:02.437 --> 01:39:04.606
I couldn't forgive her

01:39:05.649 --> 01:39:10.028
Who does she think she is
to forgive me?

01:39:10.028 --> 01:39:11.446
Are you crazy?

01:39:11.613 --> 01:39:13.990
- Why drag dad into this?
- Shut up!

01:39:18.787 --> 01:39:21.790
Did you play her?

01:39:21.873 --> 01:39:25.627
It's not like that...

01:39:27.629 --> 01:39:28.797
I'm sorry

01:39:28.922 --> 01:39:30.799
Did you play her like a goddamn toy?

01:39:30.799 --> 01:39:32.425
Stop it, Man-ji

01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:36.721
Mi-ra was one of few
who were nice to her

01:39:36.930 --> 01:39:40.558
Then, she got mad after
seeing our parent together

01:39:41.267 --> 01:39:44.688
It was one fight
How can anyone...

01:39:46.314 --> 01:39:47.816
die over it?

01:39:51.152 --> 01:39:52.320
I'm sorry...

01:39:54.114 --> 01:39:57.492
I know how you feel

01:39:58.410 --> 01:40:01.246
but if you have something
to say to my sister

01:40:01.997 --> 01:40:04.124
talk to me
Don't yell at her

01:40:07.002 --> 01:40:08.336
Let's go, Mi-ra

01:40:20.890 --> 01:40:24.352
You're so good, I hate you

01:40:29.441 --> 01:40:31.443
She's not going to college?

01:40:31.735 --> 01:40:37.532
She gave up college and
wanted to move to a vocational class

01:40:38.867 --> 01:40:46.207
but after what happened to her sister,
she changed her mind

01:40:46.458 --> 01:40:48.334
She says she wants to
go to a good college

01:40:50.837 --> 01:40:55.842
With her grades, she can apply
to any college of her choice

01:40:55.925 --> 01:40:56.885
I see

01:40:57.052 --> 01:40:59.804
If you look here...

01:41:41.930 --> 01:41:43.098
AAC

01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:45.642
AAB

01:41:50.438 --> 01:41:52.107
How beautiful you are

01:41:55.610 --> 01:41:58.113
Please don't die early

01:42:33.481 --> 01:42:35.984
You know the Chinese restaurant
outside Chowon Apartments

01:42:36.025 --> 01:42:38.403
They got busted for using
out of date flour

01:42:39.028 --> 01:42:41.990
I had food poisoning
from eating there earlier

01:42:43.491 --> 01:42:46.786
Bosingak!
The one right outside the building

01:43:11.269 --> 01:43:12.896
You came far

01:43:13.897 --> 01:43:15.273
What have you got there?

01:43:16.649 --> 01:43:18.026
It's ours

01:43:18.193 --> 01:43:19.527
Yours?

01:43:22.363 --> 01:43:24.365
Never mind
It's from my parent's restaurant

01:43:24.657 --> 01:43:27.118
Yes. So, these are
from your restaurant

01:43:28.077 --> 01:43:30.747
Harassing your parent won't
helps you release your anger

01:43:31.039 --> 01:43:35.335
You can only live
by torturing someone?

01:43:35.335 --> 01:43:39.255
This is the only way we'll move
After the restaurant shuts down

01:43:41.216 --> 01:43:43.176
Why are you doing this to me?

01:43:44.928 --> 01:43:46.262
Why?

01:43:48.223 --> 01:43:52.060
Why? Everyone else except you
will know why, bitch!

01:43:53.186 --> 01:43:54.938
Why did you do it to Cheon-ji?

01:43:55.188 --> 01:43:57.565
Why did you all do it to her?

01:43:59.609 --> 01:44:04.572
You can kill yourself over nothing
She was a freak all along

01:44:05.907 --> 01:44:09.577
Everyone says that about her
Where could she go?

01:44:09.661 --> 01:44:12.914
How is she supposed to say
how much she suffered

01:44:13.414 --> 01:44:17.627
how broken and torn she was

01:44:21.130 --> 01:44:22.966
I hate going to school

01:44:24.926 --> 01:44:27.595
I hate it so much
that I'm gonna go crazy

01:44:28.596 --> 01:44:30.640
And Cheon-ji's not there anymore

01:44:32.934 --> 01:44:36.896
No one believe me
when I say this

01:44:37.772 --> 01:44:40.024
No one!

01:44:42.193 --> 01:44:44.279
But I miss her, too

01:44:46.781 --> 01:44:48.658
I really miss her

01:44:53.246 --> 01:44:54.664
You, crazy bitch

01:45:14.809 --> 01:45:16.144
Let's go

01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:19.480
Man-ji

01:45:19.605 --> 01:45:22.817
Come on. It's dangerous
to be by yourself here

01:45:28.781 --> 01:45:30.700
I'm so sorry
Forgive me

01:45:38.708 --> 01:45:40.877
Cheon-ji left this for you

01:45:55.933 --> 01:45:59.228
<i>I'll forgive you before I go</i>

01:46:00.021 --> 01:46:04.192
<i>Because you'll still be here
after I'm gone</i>

01:46:05.234 --> 01:46:09.280
<i>I wish you won't do it again</i>

01:46:10.365 --> 01:46:14.160
<i>I wish you won't suffer no more</i>

01:46:16.996 --> 01:46:19.499
Don't manipulate people
from now

01:46:20.083 --> 01:46:23.169
No matter what glittery things
you have in your hands

01:46:23.544 --> 01:46:27.340
It's nothing to those who
doesn't care about them

01:46:29.008 --> 01:46:30.718
And I will make sure

01:46:31.386 --> 01:46:35.181
that you don't wear out
and follow my sister's path

01:46:36.808 --> 01:46:38.810
Not because I like you

01:46:38.893 --> 01:46:44.273
but because I can't let my sister
take blames even after she died

01:46:46.734 --> 01:46:48.694
I start now

01:46:49.153 --> 01:46:51.656
until I find her
last ball of yarn

01:46:54.575 --> 01:46:56.077
Let's go home

01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:58.139
<i>I'm sorry for leaving early</i>

01:47:58.973 --> 01:48:01.476
<i>I'll eat well wherever I go</i>

01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:08.649
<i>So, promise me that
you'll be strong</i>

01:48:09.692 --> 01:48:13.070
<i>or I'll be very sad</i>

01:48:14.906 --> 01:48:17.658
<i>I love you, mom</i>

01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:29.545
I love you, too, Cheon-ji

01:50:48.726 --> 01:50:50.394
Were you waiting for me?

01:50:54.815 --> 01:50:58.653
I'm so tired
Give me a piggyback ride?

01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:00.988
You will?

01:51:02.448 --> 01:51:05.201
Oh, I am so happy!
You come to me

01:51:08.162 --> 01:51:13.250
You cold-hearted brat
Wait! Stop

01:51:14.835 --> 01:51:16.879
Only because you're
embarrassing me

01:51:19.507 --> 01:51:21.217
Don't push it, mom

01:51:32.103 --> 01:51:33.270
Come on

01:51:35.189 --> 01:51:36.774
It's awkward

01:51:37.024 --> 01:51:38.192
As you like

01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:46.784
Mom

01:51:47.535 --> 01:51:49.370
Cheon-ji was in my dream

01:51:51.372 --> 01:51:52.790
Was she smiling?

01:51:53.332 --> 01:51:58.796
The widest smile...
We gave her a big hug

01:52:00.756 --> 01:52:04.260
She must be doing well

01:52:42.214 --> 01:52:45.676
<i>My dear little sister,</i>

01:52:46.635 --> 01:52:50.264
<i>you've always been
the sweetest sister</i>

01:52:52.349 --> 01:52:56.270
<i>I won't forget you
no matter how far away you are</i>

01:52:58.105 --> 01:53:01.150
<i>I love you, sis</i>

01:53:38.062 --> 01:53:39.814
<i>I hope you're well and happy</i>

01:53:40.481 --> 01:53:43.692
<i>It was nothing after a while,
isn't it?</i>

01:53:45.486 --> 01:53:48.948
<i>Thank you for pulling through it</i>

01:53:49.305 --> 01:53:55.561
