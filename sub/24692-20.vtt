The following story is fictional and does
not depict any actual person or event.

00:04.365 --> 00:06.896
In New York City's war on crime,

00:06.896 --> 00:10.054
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:10.054 --> 00:11.995
of the Major Case Squad.

00:11.995 --> 00:14.413
These are their stories.

00:16.193 --> 00:17.933
What would a baby girl love?

00:20.275 --> 00:22.063
Stuffed monkey, no doubt!

00:23.723 --> 00:26.367
Hey, mom, how you doing, mom?
I love you!

00:26.367 --> 00:27.767
Congratulations!

00:31.123 --> 00:34.676
Justie! Come give your mama a kiss.

00:36.039 --> 00:37.034
How do I look?

00:37.034 --> 00:39.180
Beautiful like always.

00:39.180 --> 00:41.587
Come meet your new baby sister.

00:41.587 --> 00:43.688
Say hi, Ava.

00:44.231 --> 00:47.389
Hey, hey, you got a cold?
Sanitize.

00:47.389 --> 00:49.687
Make sure Ava's not blocked.

00:49.687 --> 00:51.345
Can we take your entrance
again, Justin?

00:51.345 --> 00:52.559
Why?

00:52.559 --> 00:54.647
It was real.
This is a reality show.

00:54.647 --> 00:56.319
I know this is your show, honey,

00:56.319 --> 01:00.291
but this is Ava's big TV debut.
Let her shine.

01:00.291 --> 01:02.841
Sure, whatever you want, mom.

01:03.116 --> 01:05.081
Oh, my angel.

01:05.081 --> 01:06.621
Ronnie, how's the hair?

01:06.621 --> 01:08.553
It's fine. It's perfect.
Come on, let's go.

01:08.553 --> 01:11.061
- Come on, all right.
- My two angels.

01:12.837 --> 01:14.734
Oh, I love you.

01:17.018 --> 01:19.633
Justin's, like, the sweetest guy
I have ever met.

01:19.633 --> 01:21.954
No attitude, no drama...

01:21.954 --> 01:23.432
Now what you saying?

01:23.432 --> 01:24.607
Uh-huh?

01:24.607 --> 01:27.785
Nothing.
We're not talking about you.

01:27.785 --> 01:31.390
Don't listen to them.
I'm a BAD! Bad boy.

01:37.364 --> 01:41.172
Oh, baby, can you hook me up?

01:42.047 --> 01:43.577
Let's dance.

01:51.827 --> 01:55.488
Everybody, don't, don't know.

01:56.443 --> 01:58.284
- Justin!
- Justin, are you all right?

01:59.051 --> 02:01.806
Justin, Justin, get up!

02:01.806 --> 02:02.942
Somebody help, please?

02:02.942 --> 02:04.683
Help! Help!

02:04.683 --> 02:06.254
Oh, my God!

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2007/05/08

02:57.033 --> 02:58.603
Justin Holland.

02:58.603 --> 03:01.751
Grand mal seizures while dancing.

03:01.751 --> 03:05.294
Died in a private ambulance
on the way to the ER.

03:05.714 --> 03:08.640
Party animal roadkill.
What are we doing here?

03:08.640 --> 03:11.277
He's Lorelei Mailer's son.

03:11.277 --> 03:13.824
The stripper who married
the 90-year-old billionaire?

03:13.824 --> 03:15.122
Is this his kid?

03:15.122 --> 03:18.724
So she claims. His family's been
contesting it for years.

03:18.724 --> 03:21.611
Well, maybe the contest's over.
What did he die of?

03:21.611 --> 03:27.072
Cause: A lethal cocktail of
methadone and anti-depressants.

03:27.072 --> 03:28.873
But the manner gets complicated.

03:28.873 --> 03:32.416
He wasn't a regular user
of methadone or heroin.

03:32.416 --> 03:34.140
What did he use regularly?

03:34.140 --> 03:37.119
SSRIs.
Anti-depressants.

03:37.119 --> 03:39.499
The tox screen also picked up cocaine,

03:39.499 --> 03:41.940
ecstasy, and crystal meth
in his eyeball juice.

03:41.940 --> 03:44.061
But not in his liver or blood.

03:44.061 --> 03:48.658
Then except for the methadone and SSRIs,
he's been clean for two weeks.

03:48.658 --> 03:51.458
So the party drugs weren't
a factor in his death?

03:51.458 --> 03:53.786
Methadone and SSRIs don't mix.

03:53.786 --> 03:56.536
A kid with this much drug experience,
he would have known that.

03:56.536 --> 03:58.594
Maybe he knew and didn't care.

03:58.594 --> 04:00.363
That's existential.

04:00.363 --> 04:02.965
Someone probably slipped him
methadone without him knowing.

04:02.965 --> 04:04.473
That's paranoid.

04:04.893 --> 04:09.516
Okay, Rodgers.
Accident, suicide, homicide?

04:09.516 --> 04:13.233
Case undetermined
pending police investigation.

04:13.610 --> 04:15.353
I'm passing the buck.

04:16.238 --> 04:17.809
Max Hollywood continues

04:17.809 --> 04:21.786
to cover the tragic death of
Lorelei Mailer's son, Justin Holland.

04:21.786 --> 04:24.202
And outpouring of support for Lorelei

04:24.202 --> 04:28.264
as news of her son's shocking death
spread to her many fans.

04:28.264 --> 04:31.935
Outside the hospital where Lorelei
had just given birth to a daughter,

04:31.935 --> 04:35.668
we spoke to Men's Privilege
magazine publisher George Merritt.

04:35.668 --> 04:37.779
I just visited Lorelei.

04:37.779 --> 04:39.418
We're praying for her.

04:39.418 --> 04:43.263
Justin was a beautiful boy
with a bright future.

04:45.129 --> 04:48.955
Lorelei Mailer, a woman of
limited talent and accomplishment,

04:48.955 --> 04:51.043
loses her son to a drug overdose.

04:51.043 --> 04:54.253
And it takes up 50%
of the cable TV news haul.

04:54.253 --> 04:55.720
Am I missing something?

04:55.720 --> 04:57.468
When did this woman become an icon?

04:57.468 --> 04:59.565
Ever since she married
James Edward Holland,

04:59.565 --> 05:01.084
a guy four times her age.

05:01.084 --> 05:04.881
She went from a coal town in Kentucky
to a penthouse on Fifth avenue.

05:04.881 --> 05:06.772
Everyone loves a Cinderella story.

05:06.772 --> 05:09.188
And that makes Mr. Merritt
her fairy godmother.

05:09.188 --> 05:10.258
How does he fit in?

05:10.258 --> 05:11.993
He discovered Lorelei.

05:11.993 --> 05:15.395
She was privilege magazine's
honey of the year.

05:15.395 --> 05:18.265
And I take it Holland was a subscriber.

05:18.265 --> 05:20.005
Whirlwind courtship, quick marriage.

05:20.005 --> 05:21.658
Eight months later, Justin was born.

05:21.658 --> 05:23.601
He became an heir
to the Holland fortune.

05:23.601 --> 05:28.283
And two days after Lorelei
gives birth to her new daughter,

05:28.283 --> 05:30.796
her older boy dies.

05:31.306 --> 05:33.171
Whatever happened, a sad story.

05:33.171 --> 05:38.387
But the next 48 hours won't matter
as much as reconstructing Justin's past 48.

05:38.387 --> 05:40.004
Shouldn't be hard.

05:40.004 --> 05:41.654
It's all on tape.

05:42.273 --> 05:45.397
Justin was filming
a reality show when he died.

05:46.449 --> 05:48.772
Guess who the producer was?

05:53.223 --> 05:55.129
Justin had charisma.

05:55.129 --> 05:58.436
The camera loved him.
This is gonna destroy Lorelei.

05:58.436 --> 06:02.681
They were more like brother and sister
than mother and son.

06:05.312 --> 06:08.603
Such a shame.
I thought he was clean.

06:09.159 --> 06:12.317
- So you knew Justin was a user.
- In the past.

06:12.317 --> 06:16.608
It was a condition of the show,
obviously, that he remain sober. But...

06:16.608 --> 06:18.634
I take it he slipped.

06:18.634 --> 06:20.624
Did you film his collapsing?

06:20.624 --> 06:22.992
Yeah. We thought
he was goofing around.

06:22.992 --> 06:24.088
Look.

06:30.205 --> 06:33.133
- Justin!
- Justin, are you all right?

06:33.965 --> 06:35.226
Somebody help, please?

06:35.226 --> 06:37.061
Help! Help!

06:37.061 --> 06:39.975
You and your crew were with him
his entire last day?

06:39.975 --> 06:43.049
I never saw him take a hit,
a bump, a pill.

06:43.049 --> 06:44.408
None of the crew did, either.

06:44.408 --> 06:46.564
And he was on camera the whole time?

06:46.564 --> 06:49.420
Well, we didn't follow him
to the bathroom, but...

06:50.391 --> 06:52.711
Right. The bathroom.

06:52.711 --> 06:53.897
Here.

06:54.225 --> 06:56.894
Justin's, like, the sweetest guy
I have ever met.

06:56.894 --> 06:59.336
No attitude, no drama...

06:59.336 --> 07:01.059
What you saying?

07:01.670 --> 07:03.319
Who's the leggy girlfriend?

07:03.319 --> 07:07.049
Aleena Korshikova is
an up-and-coming Slovenian model.

07:07.049 --> 07:09.008
- Well-behaved.
- We're not talking about you.

07:09.008 --> 07:10.368
Could you pause that?

07:10.608 --> 07:12.171
Check out Aleena.

07:12.644 --> 07:14.641
Probably sinus trouble, huh?

07:14.641 --> 07:17.183
We'll need to get
her contact information.

07:17.183 --> 07:18.170
Where was this shot?

07:18.170 --> 07:19.413
Lorelei's condo.

07:19.413 --> 07:21.357
Justin lives there when he's in town.

07:21.357 --> 07:24.723
Maybe he was helping himself
to mom's medicine cabinet.

07:25.687 --> 07:27.887
My wife is obviously devastated.

07:27.887 --> 07:30.957
I mean, we all are.
It's a horrible tragedy.

07:30.957 --> 07:32.659
Lorelei's still in the hospital?

07:32.659 --> 07:33.712
With our baby.

07:33.712 --> 07:36.585
I want them both to get
as much peace as they can.

07:37.103 --> 07:40.890
The press.
They've been vultures.

07:40.890 --> 07:42.833
When was the last time you saw Justin?

07:42.833 --> 07:44.227
Uh...

07:44.510 --> 07:46.090
with Ava at the hospital.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.924
I had no idea he had
fallen off the wagon.

07:48.924 --> 07:51.187
Somebody please get that?

07:51.187 --> 07:53.035
Jolene, Princess needs to go out.

07:53.035 --> 07:54.922
The walker was here an hour ago.

07:54.922 --> 07:58.227
Hey, she's an old dog
with bladder issues.

07:58.227 --> 08:00.201
Do I have time for this?

08:00.990 --> 08:03.860
Sorry, it's been absolute chaos.

08:03.860 --> 08:04.737
Where was I?

08:04.737 --> 08:06.714
You were gonna show us Justin's room.

08:06.714 --> 08:07.800
Right.

08:08.768 --> 08:10.606
- Is this his bag?
- Uh, yeah.

08:10.606 --> 08:12.893
Um, can I ask what you're looking for?

08:12.893 --> 08:14.476
Nothing special.

08:14.476 --> 08:16.026
Just routine.

08:16.026 --> 08:17.390
Oh, yeah. Of course.

08:17.390 --> 08:19.465
These don't look like Justin's style.

08:19.465 --> 08:21.916
Uh, no, those are mine.

08:21.916 --> 08:24.599
You and your wife have separate rooms?

08:24.599 --> 08:27.531
Uh, no, she just keeps
all her stuff in the closet,

08:27.531 --> 08:29.467
'cause, you know,
she took our closet...

08:29.467 --> 08:30.759
I'll check the bathroom.

08:30.759 --> 08:33.450
Um, should I be asking for a warrant?

08:33.450 --> 08:37.190
Well, in these kind of tragedies,
the family usually cooperates.

08:37.190 --> 08:41.280
Well, I don't know where, uh,
Justin kept his stash, so...

08:41.280 --> 08:43.514
Squeaky-clean for a young guy.

08:43.514 --> 08:45.618
Well, we have help, detectives.

08:45.618 --> 08:48.123
Oh, you got a lot of people
coming in and out of here? / Yeah.

08:48.123 --> 08:50.083
- We're gonna need a list.
- Okay.

08:50.083 --> 08:51.830
As soon as possible.

08:55.250 --> 08:56.807
Anything?

08:56.807 --> 08:59.469
Maybe. Beneflu.
Cold medicine.

08:59.469 --> 09:02.516
Brightly-colored liquid.
Could mask methadone.

09:02.516 --> 09:04.002
Let's seize it.

09:04.503 --> 09:06.694
Okay, so I'm having a list printed up.

09:06.694 --> 09:08.071
Um, but if you're looking for drugs,

09:08.071 --> 09:11.986
you should check with those models
that Justin's always partying with.

09:12.933 --> 09:14.286
Drugs?

09:14.286 --> 09:15.632
I mean, you do understand that

09:15.632 --> 09:19.289
the children's cable network is about
to name Aleena role model of the year.

09:19.289 --> 09:21.767
Hey, we don't care
if she's Pablo Escobar.

09:21.767 --> 09:24.128
We wanna know about Justin.

09:30.223 --> 09:33.741
I'm not saying I did anything,
but, um..

09:33.741 --> 09:37.975
I've seen Justin do,
coke, X, crystal meth.

09:37.975 --> 09:39.437
That's all?

09:39.831 --> 09:40.805
No heroin?

09:40.805 --> 09:43.889
No. Ups, not downs.

09:44.187 --> 09:45.317
Mostly coke.

09:45.317 --> 09:47.440
You ever see him with his dealer?

09:47.440 --> 09:49.524
People were always coming up to him.

09:49.524 --> 09:50.809
How about the night he died?

09:50.809 --> 09:51.797
No.

09:51.797 --> 09:55.802
When he's taping,
Justin stays clean.

09:56.473 --> 10:00.201
Elena, we have you and Justin on tape
coming out of a bathroom together,

10:00.201 --> 10:02.280
wiping your nose.

10:02.280 --> 10:04.748
I was, um, fixing my makeup.

10:04.748 --> 10:08.357
Was Justin fixing his make-up too?

10:08.603 --> 10:10.261
He was sick.

10:10.261 --> 10:11.460
He...

10:11.460 --> 10:13.915
he took a swig of medicine.

10:13.915 --> 10:15.817
Did he ever party with methadone?

10:15.817 --> 10:19.519
Justin could get pure X,
the best coke.

10:19.519 --> 10:23.115
Why would he do methadone?
That's a crap high.

10:23.351 --> 10:24.223
Thank you.

10:24.701 --> 10:26.542
Lab report on the beneflu bottle.

10:26.542 --> 10:28.814
No prints, but traces of methadone.

10:28.814 --> 10:32.179
Which we're pretty sure
was never Justin's taste.

10:32.179 --> 10:34.153
Sure enough to infer murder?

10:34.153 --> 10:36.349
So someone knew he took SSRIs,

10:36.349 --> 10:39.728
spiked his cold medicine with methadone,
and figured that would kill him.

10:39.728 --> 10:43.500
Had to have been somebody close to him
with access to his home.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.385
Who knows their way
around pharmaceuticals.

10:45.385 --> 10:48.545
Lorelei's been in and out
of rehab her entire career.

10:49.611 --> 10:53.392
Time to tell the grieving mother
how sorry we are for her loss.

10:53.608 --> 10:56.837
Justin was the angel on my shoulder.

10:56.837 --> 11:00.803
The last time you saw Justin,
what did you talk about?

11:00.803 --> 11:02.351
Ava.

11:02.351 --> 11:03.994
He was so happy.

11:03.994 --> 11:06.663
Ms. Mailer, was Justin
on any medication?

11:06.663 --> 11:11.389
I know what they're saying
about how he died and it just isn't true.

11:11.389 --> 11:12.806
Ronnie, tell them.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.118
You're talking to the nurses?

11:14.118 --> 11:16.526
I told you,
don't talk to anybody.

11:16.526 --> 11:20.078
No newspapers, no TV.

11:20.078 --> 11:22.582
It's all garbage.

11:22.948 --> 11:25.488
I miss my sweet Justin.

11:25.488 --> 11:26.832
Guys, can we, uh,

11:26.832 --> 11:29.691
we're really stressing
Lorelei out here.

11:30.276 --> 11:33.689
Where's my sweet, sweet Justin?

11:33.689 --> 11:35.692
She always that lucid?

11:35.692 --> 11:38.459
Hey, I work hard to keep Lorelei sober.

11:38.459 --> 11:40.133
The doctor gave her a valium.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.880
You know, she's being
discharged today and...

11:42.880 --> 11:44.715
He's worried about her mental state.

11:44.715 --> 11:45.981
She's depressed?

11:45.981 --> 11:48.700
Well, she keeps saying crazy stuff,
like, you know,

11:48.700 --> 11:51.836
"I wanna be with Justin." You know?

11:51.836 --> 11:53.534
I'm kind of worried
about what's gonna happen

11:53.534 --> 11:56.009
when she finds out
that the funeral's delayed.

11:56.009 --> 11:57.736
The ME will release the body as soon as...

11:57.736 --> 11:59.048
It's not the ME!

11:59.048 --> 12:01.450
It's those two Holland bitches.

12:05.200 --> 12:08.736
James Holland has two daughters
from his first marriage.

12:08.736 --> 12:11.365
And they're saying that James
isn't Justin's dad,

12:11.365 --> 12:14.931
and they're demanding DNA
from Justin's corpse.

12:14.931 --> 12:19.196
It's awful. But that'll
never happen to you, will it?

12:19.196 --> 12:20.937
No, it won't.

12:21.465 --> 12:24.278
It'll never happen to you.

12:24.278 --> 12:25.847
Never.

12:26.495 --> 12:28.851
This case has gone
from tawdry to macabre.

12:28.851 --> 12:32.110
Disposition of this poor boy's body
is now in contention?

12:32.110 --> 12:33.786
He was into Eastern religions.

12:33.786 --> 12:37.745
Lorelei says it was his wish to have
his ashes scattered in the ganges.

12:37.745 --> 12:40.166
Spiritual choice for him,
lucky break for her

12:40.166 --> 12:42.425
if she's afraid Holland
wasn't really Justin's father.

12:42.425 --> 12:45.753
Which is why the Holland sisters
have filed an injunction on his cremation.

12:45.753 --> 12:48.241
They wanna test paternity first.

12:48.780 --> 12:51.639
Their father was 90
when Justin was born.

12:51.639 --> 12:54.865
I'm sure they'll be happy
to vent to you about Lorelei.

12:56.889 --> 12:59.675
I want my, my son.

12:59.675 --> 13:03.318
Ronnie, they can't do this.
They can't keep his body.

13:03.318 --> 13:05.925
I know. Calm down.
Let me, let me get you something.

13:08.315 --> 13:10.379
I want my Justin!

13:10.379 --> 13:11.864
I want my...

13:12.329 --> 13:14.158
I wanna die too!

13:14.158 --> 13:16.506
- Stop it.
- Unlock this!

13:16.506 --> 13:18.876
- Hush now, you're gonna wake...
- I wanna die!

13:18.876 --> 13:20.314
Lorelei, take this.

13:20.314 --> 13:22.841
Take that, okay?

13:23.984 --> 13:26.602
See, you know, that's better, right?

13:30.860 --> 13:31.739
Oh, my God.

13:31.739 --> 13:32.965
Lorelei?

13:33.817 --> 13:34.958
What the hell did you give her?

13:34.958 --> 13:35.983
I...

13:35.983 --> 13:37.417
call her doctor.

13:37.957 --> 13:39.247
Now!

13:43.448 --> 13:45.709
It's okay, baby.
Help is on its way.

13:47.906 --> 13:51.388
With all the money they have,
the Holland sisters live here?

13:51.912 --> 13:53.080
Who was that?

13:53.080 --> 13:55.424
It's the doorman at Lorelei's condo.

13:55.798 --> 13:57.104
Really?

13:57.748 --> 13:59.209
A friend of yours?

13:59.209 --> 14:00.806
He wants to be.

14:01.041 --> 14:04.587
He says a private ambulance was called
to the building's service entrance last night.

14:04.587 --> 14:07.751
Lorelei was taken away unconscious.

14:07.751 --> 14:09.315
Is she all right?

14:09.315 --> 14:13.470
Well, she came back two hours later,
like nothing happened.

14:13.984 --> 14:16.912
Lorelei's got nine lives, all right.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.114
That Lorelei woman.

14:20.114 --> 14:22.706
A dancer? Please.

14:22.706 --> 14:24.611
She took off her clothes for money.

14:24.611 --> 14:25.700
A floozy.

14:25.700 --> 14:27.469
Excuse our language.

14:27.469 --> 14:29.008
But, my father...

14:29.008 --> 14:30.661
- Our father.
- Our father...

14:30.661 --> 14:32.463
James Edward Holland.

14:32.463 --> 14:34.460
Clara, please.

14:34.460 --> 14:36.280
I'm speaking.

14:36.628 --> 14:40.743
Papa was in his 60s
when our mother died.

14:40.743 --> 14:42.552
We took care of him.

14:42.552 --> 14:44.117
I was 12.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.857
I was 7.
We did everything for him.

14:46.857 --> 14:50.803
We would lay out his clothes for him.
We'd cook for him.

14:50.803 --> 14:53.862
We would draw his mustard baths.

14:53.862 --> 14:55.479
It was just the three of us.

14:55.479 --> 14:57.627
We're papa's little girls.

14:57.886 --> 14:59.062
I see.

14:59.062 --> 15:00.723
And then...

15:01.529 --> 15:03.733
he met Lorelei.

15:04.627 --> 15:08.880
I'm sure he was in that burlesque club
for a business meeting.

15:08.880 --> 15:10.031
Probably.

15:10.031 --> 15:12.385
She didn't take care of him.

15:12.385 --> 15:16.570
She left him sitting in his Wheelchair
outside in the rain.

15:16.570 --> 15:19.358
And she never took care
of that son of hers, either.

15:19.358 --> 15:22.381
You mean Justin, your half-brother?

15:22.921 --> 15:25.086
So she says.

15:25.985 --> 15:29.027
We just want to know,
one way or the other.

15:29.027 --> 15:33.154
If he was our half-brother,
we'll mourn properly.

15:33.154 --> 15:35.088
When was the last time
you saw Justin?

15:35.088 --> 15:38.039
Well, he was about yea big.

15:38.039 --> 15:40.222
Sometimes I think
papa married that woman

15:40.222 --> 15:42.845
'cause he was disappointed in me.

15:42.845 --> 15:46.530
Once I forgot to strain
the pulp from his orange juice.

15:46.530 --> 15:50.108
I'll regret that morning
the rest of my life.

15:50.739 --> 15:52.542
He likes you.

15:53.887 --> 15:55.863
It's his musk.

16:00.514 --> 16:02.503
James Edward Holland revises his will

16:02.503 --> 16:04.257
six months before he dies.

16:04.257 --> 16:08.867
Leaving 90% of a billion
dollar fortune to Lorelei.

16:08.867 --> 16:10.414
And the Holland sisters objected.

16:10.414 --> 16:11.737
Oh, yeah. Big time.

16:11.737 --> 16:14.597
They filed a lawsuit claiming
that their father wasn't in sound mind

16:14.597 --> 16:15.893
when he changed his will.

16:15.893 --> 16:17.545
And Lorelei counter-sued.

16:17.545 --> 16:19.970
The court battle has dragged on
for ten years

16:19.970 --> 16:22.153
and will end one of three ways.

16:22.153 --> 16:24.765
Lorelei wins, she gets 90%.

16:24.765 --> 16:26.714
900 million.

16:26.714 --> 16:30.718
The sisters will just have to
get by on 100 million.

16:30.718 --> 16:31.794
Life is tough.

16:31.794 --> 16:34.411
And if Lorelei loses,
the children get...

16:34.411 --> 16:38.740
Bessie, Clara, and Justin
split the pie three ways.

16:38.740 --> 16:42.456
But since Justin's dead,
his share reverts to Lorelei.

16:42.456 --> 16:46.037
But if Justin isn't Holland's son,
the sisters take it all.

16:46.037 --> 16:50.322
Which could give them
the motive for murder.

16:51.455 --> 16:52.904
Thank you, Simmons.

16:52.904 --> 16:54.455
Oh, thank you.

16:55.842 --> 17:00.426
Well, I have a hard time picturing these
two old birds getting to the corner store,

17:00.426 --> 17:02.667
much less committing murder.

17:02.667 --> 17:05.108
Who else is feeding
at the Holland trough?

17:05.108 --> 17:07.692
Lorelei just had a baby.
Who's the father?

17:07.692 --> 17:09.275
Ronnie Chase claims to be.

17:09.275 --> 17:11.269
But Lorelei isn't known for monogamy.

17:11.269 --> 17:13.157
And what is Mr. Chase known for?

17:13.157 --> 17:15.140
He's Lorelei's manager, legal adviser,

17:15.140 --> 17:17.319
and claims to be her husband.

17:17.319 --> 17:18.665
He's a sycophant.

17:18.665 --> 17:21.781
Tells her what she wants to hear,
keeps us away.

17:21.781 --> 17:25.226
Maybe there's a reason he doesn't
want her talking to the police.

17:25.226 --> 17:27.881
Wheeler, invite Mr. Chase downtown.

17:27.881 --> 17:32.659
We could use his help ID'ing some of
Justin's friends from the reality tape.

17:32.659 --> 17:35.801
When he comes down,
you pay a visit to Lorelei.

17:35.801 --> 17:38.914
And don't let on that you know
anything about her overdose.

17:42.043 --> 17:43.415
Ronnie...

17:43.750 --> 17:45.927
God, it feels like forever.

17:45.927 --> 17:48.305
Like, over ten years.

17:48.960 --> 17:51.454
We met at the mansion.

17:51.454 --> 17:54.422
George Merritt introduced us.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.968
You know what?
Never, ever google yourself.

17:59.968 --> 18:02.906
These bloggers say the nastiest things.

18:02.906 --> 18:05.823
Well, you shouldn't look
at that stuff, Ms. Mailer.

18:05.823 --> 18:07.751
It's Lorelei.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.171
Like in the movie.

18:11.895 --> 18:14.238
That's a really nice watch.

18:14.238 --> 18:15.764
May I see it?

18:15.764 --> 18:17.223
Sure.

18:17.512 --> 18:19.130
Actually...

18:19.740 --> 18:24.013
they don't make this particular
kind of watch anymore.

18:24.013 --> 18:26.436
I like a man's watch.

18:27.472 --> 18:31.327
So you met Ronnie when you were
still married to Mr. Holland?

18:31.722 --> 18:34.415
Yeah, he gave me
really good legal advice.

18:34.415 --> 18:36.343
He told me to stay married.

18:36.343 --> 18:37.720
He's a lawyer, huh?

18:37.720 --> 18:40.112
Mm, I'm not technically a lawyer.

18:40.112 --> 18:42.359
I started out as Lorelei's manager.

18:42.359 --> 18:48.398
And, you know, we just became
much more to each other over time.

18:48.398 --> 18:50.291
But you've given her legal advice.

18:50.291 --> 18:51.826
Well, I have a legal background.

18:51.826 --> 18:54.429
That's right.
You just didn't pass the bar.

18:54.429 --> 18:58.814
But you did pass the test from
the taxi and limousine commission.

18:58.814 --> 19:00.134
Do you still have your license?

19:00.134 --> 19:01.651
That was a previous job.

19:01.651 --> 19:04.289
I thought we were here
to talk about Justin's friends.

19:04.289 --> 19:06.709
We're just trying to get
a few facts straight.

19:06.709 --> 19:08.703
The chauffeur's license.

19:08.703 --> 19:11.223
You drove strippers to bachelor parties.

19:11.223 --> 19:13.511
Clients.
I took care of them.

19:13.511 --> 19:14.541
It was money.

19:14.541 --> 19:18.097
But nothing like Lorelei money.

19:18.553 --> 19:22.160
He told me what to tell James
about the will and...

19:23.639 --> 19:26.143
he's just been a rock ever since.

19:26.143 --> 19:28.210
And he's Ava's father?

19:28.210 --> 19:30.683
Nobody's more of a father than Ronnie.

19:30.683 --> 19:31.962
'Cause we couldn't help but notice

19:31.962 --> 19:34.772
that all his clothes
were in the guest bedroom.

19:35.112 --> 19:37.557
We don't sleep together.

19:38.183 --> 19:40.520
I mean, look at him.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.691
Oh, Princess!

19:46.691 --> 19:49.350
Oh, my baby, baby, baby.

19:49.350 --> 19:51.655
Oh, I love you.

19:51.914 --> 19:56.483
Detective Logan,
it's time for my nap.

19:58.718 --> 20:00.200
Uh, Ms. Mailer?

20:01.373 --> 20:02.941
My watch.

20:03.288 --> 20:05.547
Well, it was a gift, wasn't it?

20:06.291 --> 20:08.360
You get a cut of everything
she makes, right?

20:08.360 --> 20:11.882
Okay, look, I'm used to people
casting aspersions, all right?

20:11.882 --> 20:13.564
But I work hard.

20:13.564 --> 20:15.385
Okay, like, Justin's show?

20:15.385 --> 20:17.627
I helped him get that deal.

20:17.627 --> 20:20.265
Are we gonna watch this tape or what?

20:24.343 --> 20:28.410
So, Jolene, Ronnie says
he was trying to keep her clean.

20:28.647 --> 20:31.329
Yeah, it's been real hard
since Justin died.

20:31.329 --> 20:34.078
Last night we had to
have her stomach pumped.

20:34.078 --> 20:36.129
Her stomach pumped?
What happened?

20:36.129 --> 20:37.456
She's been a wreck.

20:37.456 --> 20:39.461
Ronnie gave her sleeping pills.

20:40.835 --> 20:46.467
We understand that Justin was staying sober
to set a good example for his mom.

20:46.930 --> 20:50.388
He, uh, get along with Ronnie?

20:50.652 --> 20:52.903
The boy loved his mama.

20:52.903 --> 20:55.187
But Ronnie not so much?

20:56.236 --> 20:59.275
Maybe he thought she'd be
better off without Ronnie.

20:59.275 --> 21:01.862
Justin ever tell her that?

21:02.583 --> 21:04.682
Last few weeks...

21:04.682 --> 21:07.224
I think he was bringing her around.

21:11.195 --> 21:13.181
How long have you
and Lorelei been married?

21:13.181 --> 21:14.566
Five years.

21:14.566 --> 21:18.173
Yeah, we wanted to wait a respectable
amount of time after Holland passed.

21:18.173 --> 21:19.268
Uh-huh.

21:19.268 --> 21:22.575
And you signed paternity papers
when Ava was born?

21:22.575 --> 21:25.205
Yeah.
She's my daughter.

21:25.479 --> 21:29.182
Why would you need to sign
paternity papers if you were married?

21:29.182 --> 21:31.716
Well, we're not, uh...

21:31.716 --> 21:33.197
we're not legally married.

21:33.197 --> 21:36.275
Uh, but we did have a commitment
ceremony in Bermuda.

21:36.275 --> 21:37.608
That's beautiful.

21:37.608 --> 21:40.075
- A commitment ceremony?
- Yeah.

21:40.075 --> 21:43.349
Is that 'cause Lorelei
wasn't ready to commit?

21:43.349 --> 21:44.938
Excuse me?

21:44.938 --> 21:49.013
There were rumors that she was going
to leave you before Justin died.

21:49.013 --> 21:51.601
Yeah, well, don't believe
everything you hear.

21:51.601 --> 21:55.435
So he didn't tell his mother
that she'd be better off without you?

21:55.435 --> 21:56.861
That's ridiculous.

21:56.861 --> 21:59.564
I devote all of my energy to Lorelei.

21:59.564 --> 22:02.773
Funny how she still yo-yos
in and out of rehab.

22:02.773 --> 22:06.408
You threw a party for her in a nightclub
the last time she got out?

22:06.408 --> 22:08.641
Nothing wrong with celebrating sobriety.

22:08.641 --> 22:10.360
Are we done here?

22:10.360 --> 22:12.180
We would like to ask you
a few more questions.

22:12.180 --> 22:13.927
Okay, well, why don't you save them?

22:13.927 --> 22:16.546
You know what?
You're right about one thing, detective.

22:16.546 --> 22:17.971
I'm not a lawyer.

22:17.971 --> 22:20.267
But I did go to law school.

22:20.267 --> 22:23.053
And unless you're charging me
with anything...

22:24.609 --> 22:26.584
I'm free to walk out.

22:30.983 --> 22:34.819
Ronnie spiked Justin's cold medicine,
knowing it would kill him?

22:34.819 --> 22:36.151
Why?

22:36.151 --> 22:39.718
We think that Justin wanted Lorelei
to clean up her act and leave Ronnie.

22:39.718 --> 22:42.633
Ronnie didn't wanna lose his meal ticket.

22:43.375 --> 22:46.569
Justin's paternity results.
Lorelei was telling the truth.

22:46.569 --> 22:48.688
He's James Holland's son.

22:48.688 --> 22:51.520
So Justin's good for a third
of the Holland estate,

22:51.520 --> 22:53.185
and now it goes to his mother.

22:53.185 --> 22:55.622
Well, Ronnie's got Lorelei
right where he wants her.

22:55.622 --> 22:57.801
Depressed, lonely, and rich.

23:32.514 --> 23:34.379
Glass of lemon liqueur
on the nightstand,

23:34.379 --> 23:36.095
empty bottle of vodka in the bed.

23:36.095 --> 23:39.950
Empty bottle of anti-depressants
prescribed to Lorelei.

23:39.950 --> 23:42.039
I'll have Rodgers
put a rush on the tox screen.

23:42.039 --> 23:46.690
Well, every family gets a pass
on one suspicious death.

23:46.690 --> 23:49.452
Two in one week?
That's a little much.

23:50.626 --> 23:54.254
I came home,
heard the water running...

23:54.254 --> 23:58.619
uh, opened the door,
and she was lying there, dead.

23:58.619 --> 24:00.054
Dead?

24:00.970 --> 24:02.509
How do you know?

24:02.900 --> 24:04.352
Did you take her pulse?

24:04.352 --> 24:05.940
Did you try to revive her?

24:05.940 --> 24:10.028
This isn't the first time
I've had to call 911, detective.

24:10.028 --> 24:12.657
I mean, I know she was upset
about Justin, but...

24:12.657 --> 24:14.219
I can't...

24:14.219 --> 24:16.191
I can't believe she'd do this.

24:16.191 --> 24:18.404
So you think she killed herself, huh?

24:18.404 --> 24:19.925
Lorelei's been through it all, you know?

24:19.925 --> 24:23.342
I mean, up and down countless times.
But I've never...

24:23.342 --> 24:25.771
I have never seen her give up hope.

24:25.771 --> 24:28.134
She wanted to be with Justin.

24:28.347 --> 24:31.374
Isn't that the line of baloney
you were feeding us before?

24:31.374 --> 24:32.480
Man, you...

24:32.480 --> 24:35.380
you think you know me. Right?

24:35.380 --> 24:37.456
You don't know me, detective.

24:37.456 --> 24:39.561
I loved that woman.

24:39.561 --> 24:42.053
Let me tell you something, Mr. Chase.

24:43.827 --> 24:47.041
I think I'm getting to know you.

24:47.041 --> 24:49.684
Now, you got something else
you wanna tell me?

24:49.684 --> 24:52.753
You know something about a suicide note
we don't know about?

24:52.753 --> 24:55.182
Suicide note.

24:55.804 --> 24:58.989
Lorelei wasn't the, uh...

24:59.487 --> 25:01.451
the literary type.

25:01.451 --> 25:03.093
Oh, God.

25:04.046 --> 25:07.840
I can't, I can't believe she's gone.

25:09.172 --> 25:11.330
Lorelei would still be alive...

25:11.330 --> 25:14.155
if I said something to your partner,

25:14.155 --> 25:15.666
but I was afraid.

25:15.666 --> 25:17.044
Of Ronnie?

25:17.044 --> 25:19.190
You think he had something
to do with Lorelei's death?

25:19.190 --> 25:23.169
I leave to take Ava to the park,
Lorelei's fine.

25:23.421 --> 25:27.175
I come back, she's on the floor.
Ronnie's standing over her.

25:27.406 --> 25:28.595
That doesn't mean he killed her.

25:28.595 --> 25:32.110
Twice, detective?
First my nephew, then my sister.

25:32.110 --> 25:33.901
Twice?

25:33.901 --> 25:36.615
You and Lorelei are sisters?

25:36.615 --> 25:38.131
Yeah.

25:38.131 --> 25:42.790
We used to look more alike
before Lorelei had all that work done.

25:45.022 --> 25:46.935
Not now, Princess.

25:48.345 --> 25:50.819
How long have you been her assistant?

25:50.819 --> 25:51.970
Since mama died.

25:51.970 --> 25:54.174
Lorelei, she needed
someone to watch over her.

25:54.174 --> 25:58.214
She's like a child, you know?
Trusting all the wrong people.

25:58.214 --> 26:00.410
- Like Ronnie?
- Yeah.

26:00.697 --> 26:04.412
Jolene, you said you were afraid
to tell my partner something.

26:06.871 --> 26:10.632
Ronnie, he was, he was always
giving Lorelei pills.

26:10.951 --> 26:12.920
Keeping her doped up.

26:12.920 --> 26:14.448
What about alcohol?

26:14.448 --> 26:15.871
I found vodka in her bedroom.

26:15.871 --> 26:19.272
Yeah, I tried to keep it
out of the house, but...

26:19.272 --> 26:22.579
he kept smuggling it in.
Once, I was cleaning,

26:22.579 --> 26:26.247
I found booze in his darkroom.
All kinds.

26:27.486 --> 26:30.426
You and me, we're
gonna be peaches, huh?

26:30.978 --> 26:32.458
You like that?

26:32.820 --> 26:35.009
Sweet little Ava.

26:36.181 --> 26:38.096
I could insist on a warrant, but why?

26:38.096 --> 26:39.901
You're not gonna find anything.

26:39.901 --> 26:41.758
Except for your porno stash.

26:41.758 --> 26:43.494
Co-ed spinners five?

26:43.494 --> 26:46.982
Whatever.
The producers had a pitch for us.

26:47.820 --> 26:49.447
Limoncello?

26:49.447 --> 26:52.195
Is this for a methadone cocktail?

26:52.195 --> 26:53.932
I don't know how that got there.

26:53.932 --> 26:57.240
And you're not gonna find
any methadone.

26:58.658 --> 27:01.251
That's film for my photography.

27:01.251 --> 27:02.890
More baby pictures for the tabloids,

27:02.890 --> 27:06.113
or did you take a few snaps of Lorelei
on the bathroom floor?

27:06.113 --> 27:09.814
You know what?
Expose any of those, and I'll sue.

27:15.508 --> 27:17.550
What's that, liquid film?

27:17.550 --> 27:20.313
I have no idea how that got there.

27:22.548 --> 27:24.560
It's a prescription for methadone.

27:24.560 --> 27:28.127
Patient's name, Norma Mortensen.

27:28.127 --> 27:29.826
Norma Mortensen.

27:29.826 --> 27:31.819
That's Marilyn Monroe's real name.

27:31.819 --> 27:35.046
I didn't, I didn't put that there.

27:35.572 --> 27:38.690
So you wrote the prescription
for methadone, Dr. Holgreen.

27:38.690 --> 27:43.505
Yes. She used the name Mortensen
for confidentiality.

27:43.505 --> 27:48.517
And the paparazzi went through
her trash and bribed pharmacists.

27:48.517 --> 27:49.974
So the methadone was for her.

27:49.974 --> 27:51.947
Yeah, it's safe during pregnancy.

27:51.947 --> 27:55.717
But not in combination with SSRIs.

27:55.944 --> 27:58.701
Yeah, I, I had no idea
she was on them.

27:58.701 --> 28:00.626
Hey, we're not trying
to revoke your license, doc.

28:00.626 --> 28:02.409
When was the last time
you examined her?

28:02.409 --> 28:06.193
Uh, on the set of her movie,
"Torrid mambo."

28:06.193 --> 28:08.457
- I was the cast physician.
- Torrid mambo?

28:08.457 --> 28:10.632
That came out three years ago.

28:10.632 --> 28:14.303
Her prescription's dated
three weeks ago.

28:14.690 --> 28:18.292
I got a message from Ronnie Chase.

28:18.292 --> 28:21.388
And I called the prescription
into the pharmacy.

28:21.388 --> 28:23.303
Anything besides the methadone?

28:23.303 --> 28:26.209
Viagra. For Ronnie.

28:26.445 --> 28:29.966
Lorelei was on a downward spiral
even before Justin died.

28:29.966 --> 28:34.342
The methadone was just
a precautionary measure.

28:34.342 --> 28:35.574
You ever give her any?

28:35.574 --> 28:36.476
No!

28:36.476 --> 28:38.617
And the second I heard
that Justin was coming to stay,

28:38.617 --> 28:39.959
I threw it out.

28:39.959 --> 28:41.239
He was an addict.

28:41.239 --> 28:43.157
He had no self-control.

28:43.157 --> 28:44.898
How did it end up in your darkroom?

28:44.898 --> 28:46.445
Man, come on, I...

28:46.445 --> 28:49.060
if I knew it was there,
I never would have allowed that search.

28:49.060 --> 28:52.302
Did you procure anything else,
like coke or crank or...

28:52.302 --> 28:54.854
No, nothing else.

28:54.854 --> 28:56.192
Nothing illegal.

28:56.192 --> 28:58.841
What about her anti-depressants?

28:59.300 --> 29:00.879
I didn't even know she was on those.

29:00.879 --> 29:02.312
My client has told you,

29:02.312 --> 29:05.492
he had no knowledge
of other drugs in the house.

29:05.492 --> 29:07.805
Including the viagra?

29:08.966 --> 29:11.073
Viagra?

29:11.335 --> 29:13.164
What, did you need that
to compete with all the other guys

29:13.164 --> 29:14.782
that are banging her?

29:14.782 --> 29:15.880
That's none of your business.

29:15.880 --> 29:18.052
Well, I mean, you got,
like, four paternity suits out there.

29:18.052 --> 29:20.498
You two really had
a special relationship.

29:20.498 --> 29:22.936
Yeah, we did have something special,
you son of a bitch.

29:22.936 --> 29:24.788
- You have no id...
- Detectives!

29:24.788 --> 29:29.427
My client had nothing to do
with these unfortunate overdoses.

29:29.427 --> 29:30.539
He's in mourning.

29:30.539 --> 29:33.137
And he needs to get home
to his daughter.

29:33.440 --> 29:34.825
Call a sitter.

29:34.825 --> 29:36.819
You'll have to mourn in holding.

29:40.911 --> 29:43.554
Well, he was pretty defensive
about the viagra.

29:43.554 --> 29:46.252
Maybe it wasn't just
for the occasional jolly.

29:46.252 --> 29:47.648
If it's for medical reasons,

29:47.648 --> 29:50.436
he may be incapable
of fathering a child.

29:50.711 --> 29:52.531
And if he's not the baby's father,

29:52.531 --> 29:56.895
he was better off with Lorelei alive
attesting to his paternity.

29:57.317 --> 29:58.993
Get his records.

29:59.696 --> 30:03.860
¢Ü Rock-a-bye baby on the tree top ¢Ü

30:03.860 --> 30:08.340
¢Ü when the wind blows
the cradle will rock ¢Ü

30:08.340 --> 30:12.742
¢Ü when the bow breaks
the cradle will fall ¢Ü

30:12.742 --> 30:15.677
¢Ü and down will come baby ¢Ü

30:21.758 --> 30:23.768
Oh, Princess.

30:24.022 --> 30:25.816
You're an old girl, aren't you?

30:25.816 --> 30:27.624
Leaky plumbing.

30:30.920 --> 30:32.733
So sad.

30:34.184 --> 30:36.299
Ronnie Chase had cancer.

30:36.299 --> 30:38.214
His prostate was removed five years ago,

30:38.214 --> 30:40.932
which left him impotent and sterile.

30:40.932 --> 30:43.547
Viagra cures the first,
not the second.

30:43.547 --> 30:46.818
If he's not Ava's father,
why submit to a paternity test?

30:46.818 --> 30:50.197
We think Ronnie had his sperm frozen.

30:50.197 --> 30:53.037
Turns out that Ronnie and Lorelei

30:53.037 --> 30:56.987
had an appointment with a South American
fertility clinic ten months ago.

30:56.987 --> 30:59.142
Around the time Ava was conceived.

30:59.142 --> 31:02.196
These people, it never ends.

31:02.196 --> 31:05.503
I don't suppose the clinic
will let us take a peek at the records.

31:05.503 --> 31:06.901
They may not have to.

31:06.901 --> 31:09.303
The DNA paternity results
for Ava are in.

31:09.303 --> 31:11.260
We have a surprise winner.

31:11.457 --> 31:15.976
We are very pleased to announce
that DNA tests have proven

31:15.976 --> 31:22.094
that Ava Mailer is the daughter
of our late father, James Edward Holland.

31:22.094 --> 31:24.118
As the closest living relatives,

31:24.118 --> 31:28.736
we will be seeking immediate custody
of little baby Ava.

31:28.736 --> 31:30.004
Wow.

31:30.396 --> 31:35.408
James Edward Holland fathered a baby
ten years after his death.

31:35.408 --> 31:37.625
The rich really are different.

31:40.846 --> 31:42.294
Well, that's a mistake.

31:42.294 --> 31:44.046
I mean, the clinic made a mistake.

31:44.046 --> 31:45.856
Lorelei told them to use my sperm.

31:45.856 --> 31:48.835
They obviously had James
Edward Holland's banked as well.

31:48.835 --> 31:51.151
Did Lorelei tell you that?

31:52.497 --> 31:53.299
No.

31:53.299 --> 31:57.839
Well, you know, she probably figured
his sperm was more valuable than yours.

31:57.839 --> 31:59.717
I think she double-crossed you, Ronnie.

31:59.717 --> 32:01.249
No, no, no, no, no.
She's wouldn't do that.

32:01.249 --> 32:02.350
She would not do that to me.

32:02.350 --> 32:05.171
Oh, come on, you actually believed
that Ava was your baby?

32:05.171 --> 32:08.068
- Ronnie, don't answer that!
- Yeah, of course I did!

32:08.393 --> 32:12.010
Man, the second I saw that baby,
I fell in love, all right?

32:12.010 --> 32:13.527
She's mine.

32:13.527 --> 32:16.630
She's mine! Okay?

32:16.630 --> 32:20.009
And those Holland sisters
will never get custody of her.

32:21.546 --> 32:23.667
Ronnie, your attorney
wanted you to shut up,

32:23.667 --> 32:26.398
'cause if you believe
then baby was yours...

32:26.398 --> 32:28.020
by killing Justin and Lorelei,

32:28.020 --> 32:31.784
you would become the sole
guardian of Ava and her fortune.

32:32.224 --> 32:35.825
My client could not possibly
be sure the baby was his.

32:35.825 --> 32:38.499
He knew that Lorelei
had a number of lovers.

32:38.499 --> 32:40.019
Any one of them could
have been the father.

32:40.019 --> 32:42.230
Only one of them brought methadone
into the apartment.

32:42.230 --> 32:43.708
And he threw it out!

32:43.708 --> 32:46.089
Someone must have taken it
from the trash.

32:46.089 --> 32:47.895
You didn't put it down the chute, Ronnie?

32:47.895 --> 32:49.751
Man, I don't even know
where the chute is!

32:49.751 --> 32:51.517
Then who does?

32:52.005 --> 32:53.081
The methadone?

32:53.081 --> 32:55.647
Ronnie had me pick it up
at the pharmacy.

32:55.647 --> 32:58.143
You think that's what he used
to kill Justin and Lorelei?

32:58.143 --> 33:01.456
Someone spiked his cold medicine
and her limoncello.

33:01.456 --> 33:04.221
Ronnie claims he threw
the methadone out.

33:04.848 --> 33:06.094
And you believe him?

33:06.094 --> 33:08.042
He let us search his darkroom.

33:08.042 --> 33:09.901
If he had known it was there,
he would never do that.

33:09.901 --> 33:11.519
You called his bluff.

33:11.519 --> 33:13.454
He also submitted to a paternity test,

33:13.454 --> 33:15.199
but there's no way he was the father.

33:15.199 --> 33:16.926
I mean, he could take
all the viagra he wanted,

33:16.926 --> 33:18.321
she wasn't gonna sleep with him.

33:18.321 --> 33:20.790
Look, Jolene, I don't like this guy
any more than you do,

33:20.790 --> 33:23.661
but we need some solid evidence here.

33:23.882 --> 33:24.974
Well, how about this?

33:24.974 --> 33:28.065
When he sent me to the pharmacy
to pick up the methadone,

33:28.065 --> 33:30.508
he also had me get beneflu.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.640
He knew Justin was sick.

33:32.640 --> 33:34.603
Any way you can prove that?

33:34.603 --> 33:36.293
A list.

33:36.293 --> 33:37.799
In Ronnie's writing.

33:48.835 --> 33:52.711
Not very careful of Ronnie
to send you out for the murder weapon.

33:52.711 --> 33:56.544
Oh, no one notices I'm here.
They're not careful around me.

33:56.862 --> 33:58.141
Doesn't that bother you much?

33:58.141 --> 34:00.163
No, my sister liked the attention.

34:00.163 --> 34:02.942
I was happy to be in the background.

34:03.360 --> 34:06.260
You can get some attention
with that necklace.

34:06.260 --> 34:09.192
Oh, Lorelei would have
wanted me to have it.

34:09.192 --> 34:13.143
Which reminds me.
I found your watch, detective.

34:15.819 --> 34:19.235
My sister took what she wanted.
She couldn't help herself.

34:19.828 --> 34:21.889
Is there anything else I can do?

34:21.889 --> 34:24.324
You've been very helpful, Jolene.

34:26.873 --> 34:28.333
Where's Princess?

34:28.333 --> 34:31.842
Oh, poor Princess.
She was...

34:31.842 --> 34:35.368
she was so upset about Lorelei
that she wouldn't eat.

34:35.368 --> 34:37.272
We had to put her down.

34:40.976 --> 34:44.373
You have a shopping list
in Ronnie Chase's handwriting

34:44.373 --> 34:46.516
listing methadone and beneflu,

34:46.516 --> 34:48.609
and you don't think he's the murderer?

34:48.609 --> 34:51.041
Yeah, well, we think it's strange

34:51.041 --> 34:53.802
that Jolene just happened
to save the list.

34:53.802 --> 34:57.429
She keeps finding evidence
to incriminate Ronnie.

34:57.429 --> 34:58.452
Jolene was their gopher.

34:58.452 --> 35:00.977
She must have known
they were on anti-depressants.

35:00.977 --> 35:02.741
She could have killed both of them.

35:02.741 --> 35:04.311
Cinderella's revenge.

35:04.311 --> 35:06.406
Maybe, but killing a sister...

35:06.406 --> 35:08.491
it's gotta be for more than money.

35:08.491 --> 35:11.243
Who can we talk to about their history?

35:11.243 --> 35:12.907
George Merritt?

35:12.907 --> 35:15.055
He's known the family for 20 years.

35:15.268 --> 35:18.554
She always wanted to check out early,
one way or the other.

35:18.554 --> 35:20.111
Before 40.

35:20.111 --> 35:21.526
Like Marilyn.

35:21.526 --> 35:23.697
Well, the thing is,
somebody helped her check out.

35:23.697 --> 35:26.917
Someone she was close to,
someone she trusted.

35:26.917 --> 35:30.621
Oh, she trusted everybody.
Even Ronnie.

35:30.621 --> 35:32.528
How about Jolene?

35:33.651 --> 35:36.981
That wasn't so much trust as,
uh, dependence.

35:36.981 --> 35:39.952
Jolene took care of her
and Justin.

35:40.309 --> 35:41.382
Night and day.

35:41.382 --> 35:44.146
Well, did Lorelei
ever take care of Jolene?

35:44.146 --> 35:46.251
She tried to, early on.

35:46.251 --> 35:47.339
First time I met her,

35:47.339 --> 35:50.089
she tried to get me
to use Jolene in the magazine.

35:50.089 --> 35:51.899
A sister spread.

35:51.899 --> 35:54.040
Two for one, she said.

35:54.288 --> 35:56.137
That'd be right up your alley.

35:56.137 --> 35:58.581
Jolene didn't have the goods.

35:58.784 --> 36:00.571
Lorelei...

36:00.571 --> 36:02.273
was the real deal.

36:02.273 --> 36:03.848
I told Jolene...

36:03.848 --> 36:07.858
there's only room
for one honey of the year.

36:15.605 --> 36:19.523
Jolene spent the past 20 years
in Lorelei's shadow.

36:19.523 --> 36:23.548
We think she got tired
of caretaking her sister and nephew.

36:23.548 --> 36:26.322
She kills them,
frames Ronnie Chase.

36:26.322 --> 36:29.237
Thinking she'd get custody of the baby
and the baby's millions.

36:29.237 --> 36:32.470
Right, now if the Holland
sisters get custody of Ava,

36:32.470 --> 36:34.626
that spoils that part of the plan.

36:34.626 --> 36:37.662
So what happens
if we spoiled the rest?

36:37.889 --> 36:41.875
Okay, release Ronnie,
escort him back to the condo,

36:41.875 --> 36:43.900
see how Jolene reacts.

36:43.900 --> 36:45.405
Gotcha.

36:46.592 --> 36:47.728
What's he doing here?

36:47.728 --> 36:49.538
We don't have enough
to hold him, Jolene.

36:49.538 --> 36:51.341
What do you mean?
He killed Justin!

36:51.341 --> 36:52.828
You framed me!

36:52.828 --> 36:54.617
You planted the drugs,
you planted the shopping list...

36:54.617 --> 36:55.578
You're a liar!

36:55.578 --> 36:57.708
No, I saw him go into Justin's bathroom.

36:57.708 --> 36:59.661
And that night Justin dies and
a half a bottle of beneflu

36:59.661 --> 37:02.451
ends up in the garbage?
I knew he did it.

37:02.451 --> 37:03.679
So you fished out the bottle,

37:03.679 --> 37:06.619
put it in the medicine cabinet
for us to find?

37:06.619 --> 37:07.782
Yeah.

37:07.782 --> 37:09.338
Why didn't you just tell us?

37:09.338 --> 37:12.448
'cause you wouldn't believe me
without evidence, I thought.

37:12.448 --> 37:14.029
Yeah, well, you thought wrong.
It's over, Jolene.

37:14.029 --> 37:15.244
- Come here!
- No, I'm gonna go, buddy!

37:15.244 --> 37:16.795
Stay where you are!
Stay where you are!

37:16.795 --> 37:18.953
It's over! Come on!
She's got my baby! / Jolene!

37:18.953 --> 37:20.178
Wait!

37:20.806 --> 37:22.354
Stay away from me!

37:22.530 --> 37:24.705
I told you, she's crazy.
She's a murderer.

37:24.705 --> 37:26.403
Shut up, Ronnie.

37:27.201 --> 37:30.042
Jolene, hand me the baby.

37:30.042 --> 37:31.570
She needs me.

37:32.436 --> 37:35.332
I know how to take care of her.
I've done it my whole life.

37:35.332 --> 37:38.420
Sure you have.
Like with Lorelei.

37:38.420 --> 37:40.959
Lorelei and I had each other...

37:41.206 --> 37:42.177
till him.

37:42.177 --> 37:43.967
I loved your sister.

37:43.967 --> 37:47.030
If you loved her,
you never would have killed Justin.

37:47.237 --> 37:49.613
That's not true.
Don't listen to her.

37:49.613 --> 37:50.838
Tell them what happened.

37:50.838 --> 37:53.793
Jolene, come on. Please.

37:54.762 --> 37:56.961
You love Ava, right?

37:58.973 --> 38:00.153
What if you lost her?

38:00.153 --> 38:02.027
- Jolene, please stop.
- No, no...

38:02.319 --> 38:04.879
Jolene, let me hold Ava.

38:09.866 --> 38:11.290
Tell them.

38:13.345 --> 38:14.559
Tell them!

38:14.559 --> 38:16.156
Ronnie, if you have
something to tell us,

38:16.156 --> 38:18.081
now would be the time.

38:22.036 --> 38:25.388
You wanna be a father,
act like one.

38:30.429 --> 38:32.839
I thought, I thought that Lorelei
would get over it.

38:32.839 --> 38:35.206
And she'd forget about Justin
after a while,

38:35.206 --> 38:36.842
and I'd be there for her.

38:36.842 --> 38:38.636
You're saying that you killed Justin.

38:38.636 --> 38:41.587
Did you hear that?
Tell her.

38:42.631 --> 38:44.887
He, he was telling her to,
to leave me.

38:44.887 --> 38:46.943
And I couldn't have that.

38:48.660 --> 38:51.495
It wasn't a bad death.
Just don't harm my baby, please.

38:51.495 --> 38:53.935
- For God's sakes.
- All right, it's all right, Jolene.

38:53.935 --> 38:55.893
Easy, now. Just take it easy.

38:55.893 --> 38:58.668
No, I don't want him to get Ava.
He'll trick those sisters.

38:58.668 --> 39:00.234
No, he won't.
He's going to prison.

39:00.234 --> 39:02.009
He won't hurt you or the baby.

39:02.009 --> 39:03.466
Like he hurt my sister.

39:03.466 --> 39:06.043
No, I had nothing to do
with her death, I swear!

39:06.043 --> 39:07.478
You know the truth, Jolene!

39:07.478 --> 39:10.138
Taking her son.
I've never seen anyone cry so hard.

39:10.138 --> 39:12.094
She was sick about it.

39:12.094 --> 39:14.429
But you took care of her.

39:15.456 --> 39:17.949
She was in so much pain.

39:18.307 --> 39:20.092
She was so sad.

39:20.092 --> 39:23.070
Like Princess, her dog.

39:23.641 --> 39:26.114
Poor dumb creature.

39:26.114 --> 39:28.788
She wasn't any good to herself
or anybody else.

39:28.788 --> 39:32.683
She knew it was time to go.
She was grateful.

39:35.217 --> 39:38.821
How did you take care
of your sister, Jolene?

39:41.310 --> 39:46.179
She said she wanted to kill herself
to be with Justin.

39:47.415 --> 39:48.450
And I was afraid.
I couldn't...

39:48.450 --> 39:50.949
I couldn't let her take Ava too.

39:56.791 --> 39:59.553
I put it in her limoncello.

40:00.376 --> 40:02.635
Her favorite drink.

40:04.124 --> 40:08.002
Well, you were protecting Ava.

40:10.940 --> 40:13.800
Lorelei wasn't any good as a mother.

40:13.800 --> 40:16.162
It wasn't her fault, she just...

40:16.162 --> 40:17.792
she didn't know how.

40:17.792 --> 40:22.167
Ava's innocent, helpless.

40:22.167 --> 40:24.886
Yeah. So pure.

40:26.727 --> 40:30.176
She looks like Lorelei
when she was little.

40:32.662 --> 40:34.867
I think she looks like you.

40:35.894 --> 40:38.112
What color are her eyes?

40:39.204 --> 40:42.346
Blue. Like mine.

40:42.655 --> 40:44.984
Exactly like yours.

40:45.674 --> 40:48.804
She's gonna be beautiful
when she grows up.

40:51.675 --> 40:54.275
Can I hold her, Jolene?

41:11.195 --> 41:13.307
She's beautiful already.

41:17.042 --> 41:18.794
She's my baby.

41:19.374 --> 41:21.203
She's so pure.

41:21.623 --> 41:23.436
She's got her whole life.

41:24.265 --> 41:25.275
Okay?
