00:01.835 --> 00:04.138
(indistinct chatter)

00:13.181 --> 00:14.482
POOLE:
Happy Thanksgiving.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.649
FRANK:
Happy Thanksgiving.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.251
You haven't answered
my question.

00:17.285 --> 00:18.386
Have you seen it?

00:18.419 --> 00:21.222
If it was in the
intelligence briefing,

00:21.255 --> 00:22.690
then, yes, I saw it.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.125
And?

00:24.158 --> 00:26.094
And all in all, I
think it's going to be

00:26.127 --> 00:29.230
a beautiful Thanksgiving
Day in the greatest
city in the world.

00:29.263 --> 00:30.531
Happy Thanksgiving.

00:30.564 --> 00:33.667
Thank you.
"Thank you,
Commissioner."

00:33.701 --> 00:35.069
Happy Thanksgiving.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.237
Mr. Mayor!

00:36.270 --> 00:37.305
Oh.

00:39.140 --> 00:42.510
Warm holiday sentiments
won't change the threat.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.512
"Threat" is a term
with wide latitude.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.314
I'm aware of that, Frank.

00:46.347 --> 00:49.217
Here you go.
Happy Thanksgiving.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.685
You a stuffing guy
or a potatoes guy?

00:51.719 --> 00:55.256
Stuffing. What if that threat
becomes a reality?

00:55.289 --> 00:58.392
Cornbread and sausage
or breadcrumbs and walnuts?

00:58.426 --> 01:00.261
Cornbread.
Then you'll
have to join us

01:00.294 --> 01:02.530
one day, because
that is my specialty.

01:02.563 --> 01:03.631
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:03.664 --> 01:04.832
Frank.

01:04.865 --> 01:05.866
MAN:
Thanks. You, too.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.635
What if?

01:07.668 --> 01:10.138
Not on my watch, sir.

01:11.172 --> 01:12.706
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:15.276 --> 01:16.777
(whistles)

01:16.810 --> 01:19.680
Wow.
Now, that is
some big bird.

01:19.713 --> 01:22.350
I think it weighs
more than Sean.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.852
(chuckles): Go easy
on the stuffing.

01:24.885 --> 01:27.288
I couldn't sleep
a wink last year.

01:27.321 --> 01:28.756
That's funny, I
remember you snoring

01:28.789 --> 01:30.424
on the couch
like a mule.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.193
Don't be a
wisenheimer.

01:32.226 --> 01:33.694
Who, me?
Yeah, you.

01:33.727 --> 01:36.197
Here, give me a hand getting
down the turkey platter.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.466
Oh, Henry, not the platter.

01:38.499 --> 01:41.269
I'll have you know,
this platter was a gift

01:41.302 --> 01:43.537
to this family
from Eleanor Roosevelt.

01:43.571 --> 01:46.840
No, allegedly, it was a gift
from Eleanor Roosevelt

01:46.874 --> 01:50.411
to the family in Yonkers whose
yard sale you bought it at.

01:50.444 --> 01:53.681
Just for that, I'll leave
it to Erin in my will.

01:53.714 --> 01:56.116
Promises, promises.

01:59.253 --> 02:00.754
(phone ringing)

02:00.788 --> 02:02.723
Is that you or me?

02:02.756 --> 02:04.358
I don't know.

02:04.392 --> 02:05.626
(ringing continues)

02:05.659 --> 02:07.328
(sighs):
Me.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.263
Who is it?

02:09.297 --> 02:10.864
Nobody.

02:10.898 --> 02:13.301
Jacob Nobody?

02:13.334 --> 02:15.236
Okay, missy...

02:15.269 --> 02:18.206
you know how you always ask
me to respect your privacy?

02:18.239 --> 02:20.774
Well, that road goes
both ways, okay?

02:20.808 --> 02:22.410
So if I want to take
his call, I'll take

02:22.443 --> 02:24.178
his call; if I don't
want to take his call,

02:24.212 --> 02:26.180
I'm not gonna
take his call.

02:26.214 --> 02:27.815
But that's my call;
it's my decision.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.184
But, Mom, he's...
He's what?

02:30.218 --> 02:31.319
I know, you think he's hot.

02:31.352 --> 02:34.288
But it's not the most important
thing in a relationship.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.190
That's not what
I was going to say.

02:36.224 --> 02:38.192
Hello, Erin.
It's Jacob.

02:38.226 --> 02:40.228
Your office said you
might be on your cell,

02:40.261 --> 02:41.762
but I guess
I missed you.

02:41.795 --> 02:44.465
Call me when you can.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.634
You think you
could have told me?

02:46.667 --> 02:48.336
I was trying to.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.970
Hi.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.340
(chuckles):
Hi.
ERIN:
I guess this is me

02:52.373 --> 02:54.308
returning your
phone call.
Thanks for

02:54.342 --> 02:55.709
getting back to
me so quickly.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.311
Are you two free
for lunch later?

02:57.345 --> 02:59.247
Yes.
No.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.749
Well, one
out of two.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.452
It's actually a work day for me.

03:04.485 --> 03:07.255
Then a New York lunch,
a gulp and go.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.757
No, I'm sorry, we can't.
We'd love to.

03:09.790 --> 03:12.760
Then let me drop
you, at least.

03:12.793 --> 03:15.229
It's quite all right,
we're fine.

03:16.330 --> 03:19.300
And we'd love to.

03:19.333 --> 03:22.336
Victory at last.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.837
Was there a discount
on the pumpkins?

03:23.871 --> 03:26.640
No, the ugliest ones work
the best for pumpkin pie.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.351
Everything okay?

03:37.385 --> 03:39.387
Yeah, yeah. Great.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.993
RENZULLI: Wait until
you see the crowds at the
Thanksgiving parade tomorrow.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.495
You're gonna love
this detail, Reagan.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.729
Yeah, why's that?

03:48.762 --> 03:50.364
'Cause if the
wind kicks up

03:50.398 --> 03:51.999
you could be in for
some serious fun.

03:52.032 --> 03:54.302
One year we lost a balloon
to a nor'easter,

03:54.335 --> 03:55.836
and we had to shoot it down.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.338
That's not why.

03:57.371 --> 03:58.406
Parade tour ends at 1500,

03:58.439 --> 04:00.908
which gets me home in time
for Thanksgiving dinner.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.676
We like to eat about 4:00.

04:02.710 --> 04:03.744
4:00, huh?

04:03.777 --> 04:05.946
(phone ringing)
Hey.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.781
Oh, hey, I got to
take this, all right?

04:07.815 --> 04:09.750
Yeah.
Yeah.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.485
Yeah, it's me.

04:11.519 --> 04:13.020
Hey, yeah, all right.

04:13.053 --> 04:15.055
I said all right, didn't I?

04:15.088 --> 04:16.424
I'll have it.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.759
Look, this isn't a good time.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.361
(woman screams)

04:20.394 --> 04:21.895
(thudding, bystanders gasp)

04:21.929 --> 04:23.531
Reagan!

04:28.101 --> 04:30.003
Back up.
She fell out
of the building.

04:30.037 --> 04:33.474
I need a bus forthwith!
80th and Amsterdam.

04:37.545 --> 04:39.647
I got nothing, Sarge.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.881
(bystanders murmuring)

05:09.009 --> 05:10.678
(sirens wailing)

05:14.482 --> 05:15.883
Hey.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.551
There's Danny now.

05:17.585 --> 05:19.953
(groans) Oh, boy.
This is my least
favorite job.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.555
Jumpers.
Yeah.

05:21.589 --> 05:23.524
Mine's suspicious odors.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.459
I'll take that over
an EDP with a weapon.

05:25.493 --> 05:26.827
I'm with Jackie. Jumpers.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.462
What's the story here?

05:28.496 --> 05:29.597
We saw her fall.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.865
Did you see her fall,
or did you see where she landed?

05:31.899 --> 05:33.534
Landed.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.736
Do we got any other
information on her?
Building manager

05:35.769 --> 05:37.571
says her name is Ayla Demir.

05:37.605 --> 05:38.772
22 years old.
A law student.

05:38.806 --> 05:41.575
JACKIE:
What about a
building manager?

05:41.609 --> 05:43.977
Did he say if there
were any visitors?
It was a buzz-in situation.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.746
Last time he saw her,
she was coming back

05:45.779 --> 05:46.914
from the gym this morning.

05:46.947 --> 05:49.983
All right, we're
gonna head upstairs.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.688
You okay?

05:54.722 --> 05:56.890
Yeah. Little while ago
I was thinking about pecan pie,

05:56.924 --> 05:59.126
now I can't even think
about having an appetite.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.395
Okay, why don't you think
about football, halftime?

06:01.429 --> 06:02.830
I'm gonna kick your
ass in the backyard

06:02.863 --> 06:03.597
and defend my title.

06:03.631 --> 06:06.099
Wait, what title?
Wewon last year.

06:06.133 --> 06:08.836
But I had Linda on my team
last year; that's a handicap.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.003
Otherwise I would
have kicked your ass.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.139
And you better not
tell her I said that.

06:12.172 --> 06:13.674
See you.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.017
What do you think?

06:24.051 --> 06:25.586
Well, she
would've had

06:25.619 --> 06:27.621
a really good view of
the parade from here.

06:27.655 --> 06:28.889
No signs of struggle.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.958
Maybe she looked out
and leaned over too far.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.860
You check upstairs?
Yeah, it's
all clear.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.595
No suicide note?

06:34.628 --> 06:36.530
No, not yet.

06:36.564 --> 06:39.633
You know, it looks like
she was expecting company.

06:39.667 --> 06:40.901
Well...

06:42.002 --> 06:44.605
Yep, she's got a turkey,

06:44.638 --> 06:46.139
some pies, unopened milk.
She definitely

06:46.173 --> 06:47.475
went shopping.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.942
All right, she got on
workout clothes.

06:48.976 --> 06:51.144
Super says she goes
to the gym, works out.

06:51.178 --> 06:53.113
She's having people over;
she's got fresh turkey

06:53.146 --> 06:54.648
in the fridge.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.484
Doesn't exactly sound
like a suicide to me.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.918
No. Suicide victim
who works out

06:57.951 --> 07:00.120
and goes shopping for a party?

07:00.153 --> 07:02.456
I don't think so.
What's it say?

07:02.490 --> 07:04.725
"Mom, Hafiz and Meliha,
Happy Thanksgiving.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.527
Love, Ayla."

07:06.560 --> 07:08.696
Happy Thanksgiving.

07:08.729 --> 07:11.031
Happy Thanksgiving.

07:15.636 --> 07:16.970
No, I'm notpositive.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.205
I-I just...

07:18.238 --> 07:20.841
He read NYPD to me.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.643
Erin why would the NYPD have
somebody following you?

07:22.676 --> 07:24.177
And why would Dad
not know about it?

07:24.211 --> 07:27.881
I don't know, that's what
I'm calling you to find out.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.717
Were you alone?

07:29.750 --> 07:32.152
No, I was with Nicky...
and friend.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.688
Whoa, what do you mean
you were with a friend?

07:34.722 --> 07:35.989
(stammers)

07:36.023 --> 07:37.725
You know what?

07:37.758 --> 07:39.927
Um, forget I called.

07:42.563 --> 07:43.797
May I come in?

07:43.831 --> 07:44.898
Yeah, I wish you would.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.567
Maybe you can explain to me

07:46.600 --> 07:48.168
why you were following me
this morning.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.637
Detective DeLeon.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.872
And, uh, you're not
the one I was watching.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.006
Then who?

07:55.609 --> 07:56.810
Jacob?

07:56.844 --> 07:58.812
I'm in charge of
investigating art thefts

07:58.846 --> 08:00.681
from galleries, museums.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.583
We believe that Mr. Krystal

08:02.616 --> 08:04.952
is responsible for a
number of major hauls,

08:04.985 --> 08:06.620
both here and abroad.

08:06.654 --> 08:09.523
We got word that he entered
the New York area last month,

08:09.557 --> 08:11.692
and, uh, we're keeping
an eye on him.

08:11.725 --> 08:15.028
Well, if he's an art thief,
why don't you arrest him?

08:15.062 --> 08:17.898
(chuckles):
I wish it was that simple.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.800
In this office,
it is that simple.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.302
Innocent until we've
proven them guilty.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.138
We may not have enough to move
on him yet, but he is a person

08:25.172 --> 08:27.575
of interest in a number of
heists over the past six years.

08:27.608 --> 08:30.711
In the six years that
you've been watching him,

08:30.744 --> 08:32.112
all you've got
is that he's

08:32.145 --> 08:33.180
a person of interest?

08:33.213 --> 08:34.648
I said he was a thief,

08:34.682 --> 08:36.149
I didn't say he was bad at it.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.886
He pulled off his last heist
knowing we were watching him.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.988
Maybe he's not
as good as you think.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.290
Maybe he didn't do it.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.894
Okay, so why are
you coming to me?

08:46.927 --> 08:48.028
Professional courtesy.

08:48.061 --> 08:50.063
I just thought you
might want to know.

08:50.097 --> 08:53.767
Well, now I know.

08:53.801 --> 08:56.036
All right.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.278
LINDA:
Go easy on that butter.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.047
Isn't that on the list

09:07.080 --> 09:08.716
of things you're
supposed to avoid?

09:08.749 --> 09:11.184
(chuckles): I don't know,
I lost that list.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.121
Basically,
if something
tastes good,

09:14.154 --> 09:16.724
I'm pretty sure I
shouldn't be eating it.

09:16.757 --> 09:19.159
The boys are so excited
about tomorrow.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.161
Yeah. It's always been
my favorite holiday.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.030
No presents.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.732
No pressure.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.600
Just wonderful food and family.

09:26.634 --> 09:27.801
What's not to love?

09:27.835 --> 09:28.936
Am I supposed

09:28.969 --> 09:31.805
to put a whole teaspoon
of vanilla in here or a half?

09:31.839 --> 09:33.641
Use a whole.
I love vanilla.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.008
You got it.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.143
Oh...

09:36.176 --> 09:38.178
Oh, let me get that.
Mm?

09:38.211 --> 09:40.213
So, while they're all
playing football tomorrow,

09:40.247 --> 09:41.982
why don't you and I

09:42.015 --> 09:45.018
have that chess rematch
you've been avoiding?

09:45.052 --> 09:47.087
Get me out of that
football game.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.156
(pained grunt)

09:49.189 --> 09:50.791
Oh!

09:51.992 --> 09:53.126
Pop?

09:53.160 --> 09:56.129
Henry! Henry!
(grunting in pain)

09:57.130 --> 09:59.166
(grunts)

09:59.199 --> 10:00.901
(exhales)

10:05.939 --> 10:07.174
Mayor Poole, sir.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.742
Thank you, Abigail.

10:08.776 --> 10:09.943
Mr. Mayor.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.111
Frank.

10:11.144 --> 10:14.181
I just got off the phone
with the FBI.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.716
And I just talked
to Homeland Security.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.017
What a team we make.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.086
FBI thinks it's
a credible threat now,

10:19.119 --> 10:20.954
an attempt
on the Lincoln Tunnel.
Actually,

10:20.988 --> 10:24.224
the terminology is "credible
but unconfirmed threat."

10:24.257 --> 10:25.859
Isn't this what
you were waiting for?

10:25.893 --> 10:27.227
I'm not waiting
for it, Mr. Mayor.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.229
I'm trying to stay
out ahead of it.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.398
I understand that, Frank, but I
think we should do something.

10:31.431 --> 10:34.234
I've increased patrol
by a third, set up checkpoints,

10:34.267 --> 10:37.204
deployed counterterrorism units
throughout the city,

10:37.237 --> 10:39.172
increased bag searches
in the subway

10:39.206 --> 10:42.109
and ordered all our
harbor launches out on patrol.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.711
That is something.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.181
Maybe we should close
the Lincoln Tunnel

10:48.215 --> 10:50.350
for the day, just to be safe.

10:50.383 --> 10:53.253
That could cause a panic

10:53.286 --> 10:55.022
for no reason.
Do you know

10:55.055 --> 10:57.257
how many people come into
New York to watch the parade?

10:57.290 --> 10:58.726
Three and a half million.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.093
And do you
know how many

11:00.127 --> 11:02.996
threats like this come
through my office every day?

11:03.030 --> 11:05.065
Frank, if there's even
a possibility of a bomb...

11:05.098 --> 11:06.166
That possibility
exists

11:06.199 --> 11:09.236
every second of every day.

11:10.370 --> 11:11.705
Mr. Mayor,

11:11.739 --> 11:13.040
you're doing your job here.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.908
You're asking exactly
the right questions.

11:14.942 --> 11:17.444
And your alarm is
absolutely appropriate.

11:17.477 --> 11:20.914
But I've been doing
this for a while...

11:20.948 --> 11:23.283
and I'm asking for your trust.

11:23.316 --> 11:26.286
Of course you have my trust.

11:26.319 --> 11:30.257
The last thing you want
is the last thing I want.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.025
Commissioner,
it's Linda Reagan.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.994
She says it's
an urgent family matter.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.500
What hospital?

11:40.533 --> 11:42.302
St. Victor's.

11:42.335 --> 11:43.804
Who is it?

11:43.837 --> 11:45.806
Your father, sir.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.844
Frank...

11:50.878 --> 11:53.413
You'll have to excuse me, sir.

12:01.088 --> 12:02.222
This girl's made a lot of calls

12:02.255 --> 12:03.891
to her family's
home phone number.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.392
JACKIE:
All right, so she had

12:05.425 --> 12:07.027
a good relationship
with her parents.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.128
Maybe we go talk to them,

12:08.161 --> 12:10.898
and maybe they know who
she was having trouble with.

12:10.931 --> 12:13.533
Or maybe it was the family
that had a problem with her.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.168
Look at this text message.

12:15.202 --> 12:16.169
"Stop shaming your family.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.338
You know what you need to do."

12:18.371 --> 12:20.273
It's from a cell
phone registered
to her own brother,

12:20.307 --> 12:21.208
Hafiz Demir.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.076
You know what that sounds like?

12:23.110 --> 12:25.212
It sounds like an honor killing.
Family doesn't approve

12:25.245 --> 12:27.380
of the boy the girl's dating,
father or brother kills her.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.982
Course, then there's
the new and improved

12:29.016 --> 12:30.217
version of
honor killings, where the, uh...

12:30.250 --> 12:33.253
Yeah, to make sure the dad and
the brother don't go to jail

12:33.286 --> 12:34.888
they pressure her
to do the job herself.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.223
DANNY:
Exactly.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.558
We may be looking
at a forced suicide.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.794
Let's go pay
this family a visit.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.868
WOMAN:
I don't believe it.

12:47.901 --> 12:50.337
My daughter would never
take her own life.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.205
Ayla was such a happy girl.

12:52.239 --> 12:53.406
She was

12:53.440 --> 12:55.175
cooking us
Thanksgiving dinner.

12:55.208 --> 12:58.145
Look at her face,
look at her face.

12:59.880 --> 13:03.150
She would never
commit suicide.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.152
It makes no sense.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.053
We're not sure
what happened.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.155
We don't know
if she committed suicide.

13:08.188 --> 13:09.489
We were hoping
that you all

13:09.522 --> 13:12.025
could help us figure
something out here.

13:12.059 --> 13:15.228
(phone vibrates)
Excuse me.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.364
JACKIE:
Um, sir, I know
it's a hard time.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.999
We just need to ask
a few questions.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.168
We'll make it quick.

13:21.201 --> 13:26.006
Mrs. Demir, when's the
last time you spoke
to your daughter?

13:26.039 --> 13:29.176
Did she tell you
that anything was
troubling her?

13:29.209 --> 13:30.343
You okay?

13:31.344 --> 13:33.013
Yeah.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.214
Yeah.

13:35.282 --> 13:36.416
Yeah.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.351
Do you know if
your daughter

13:38.385 --> 13:39.953
had any problems
with anyone?

13:39.987 --> 13:41.388
Her boyfriend.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.857
She had a boyfriend?

13:43.891 --> 13:45.225
A man named Kurt Freelander.

13:45.258 --> 13:46.359
Very bad guy.

13:46.393 --> 13:47.494
Why do
you say that?

13:47.527 --> 13:49.196
HAFIZ:
I'm a man, I know when

13:49.229 --> 13:50.497
I see it in another man.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.467
Danny?

13:54.501 --> 13:57.404
Yeah, um...

13:57.437 --> 13:59.339
Your sister received

13:59.372 --> 14:00.507
a text message.

14:00.540 --> 14:01.708
"Stop shaming your family.

14:01.741 --> 14:04.277
You know what you need to do."
Did you send that to her?

14:04.311 --> 14:06.646
Yes.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.581
Ayla knew what
I thought.

14:08.615 --> 14:11.418
But what I wanted her to do was
break up with Kurt Freelander,

14:11.451 --> 14:12.485
not jump out of a window.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.321
(sobbing)

14:14.354 --> 14:16.123
So you're saying you don't
believe in honor killings?

14:16.156 --> 14:17.624
No. And I think
they're barbaric.

14:17.657 --> 14:20.193
And if you really want to know
what happened to her, I suggest
Hold on...

14:20.227 --> 14:21.962
you leave your prejudices behind
and talk to Kurt Freelander.
Hold on...

14:21.995 --> 14:23.897
All right, settle down,
settle down, okay?

14:23.931 --> 14:25.198
Hafiz!

14:30.337 --> 14:32.039
Excuse me.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.449
(sobbing quietly)

14:52.459 --> 14:53.893
Uh, Meliha?

14:56.163 --> 14:58.598
I'm sorry, this
is very difficult.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.434
I'm sure it is.

15:01.468 --> 15:05.038
Um, your brother...

15:05.072 --> 15:07.474
is very protective
over you and your sister.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.916
Meliha, you want
to tell me something?

15:20.487 --> 15:23.190
No. I've told you everything.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.425
(whispers):
Okay.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.101
I'll call you as soon
as I hear more.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.441
How is he?

15:41.474 --> 15:45.478
(sighs): They think it
was a heart attack.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.217
Is he... is he okay?

15:50.250 --> 15:51.451
He is for now.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.020
And they're running tests.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.287
He's in there.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.623
The, uh, the doctor
said she'd update us in a...

15:56.656 --> 15:59.459
in a couple
of minutes.

15:59.492 --> 16:00.727
(sighs) What happened?

16:00.760 --> 16:02.562
We were in the kitchen,

16:02.595 --> 16:04.264
we were getting
the turkey ready,

16:04.297 --> 16:08.035
and he just...

16:08.068 --> 16:10.237
I just...

16:10.270 --> 16:12.439
I don't think of him
as vulnerable like that.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.607
Hi, Pop.

16:52.079 --> 16:54.547
What about Thanksgiving?

16:58.718 --> 17:01.588
(sighs)

17:06.193 --> 17:08.128
WOMAN: Right now
he's stabilized,

17:08.161 --> 17:11.498
but one of his coronary
arteries is 90% occluded.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.166
We'd like to do an angioplasty.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.301
That's where we blow a balloon

17:14.334 --> 17:16.436
in the artery,
clear out the plaque.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.171
Your father's
a relatively healthy man.

17:18.205 --> 17:19.206
He should do fine.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.708
But there are risks?

17:21.741 --> 17:23.310
He could blow a clot.

17:23.343 --> 17:24.677
There's a less
than ten percent chance,

17:24.711 --> 17:26.513
but a blood clot

17:26.546 --> 17:29.116
to the heart could be...

17:30.383 --> 17:33.286
Don't I need to sign
something for approval?

17:33.320 --> 17:35.088
First we need a list

17:35.122 --> 17:37.290
of all the prescription
medications he's been taking.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.162
I don't know.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.197
It's important
that we know that.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.865
Many men your father's age
are on blood thinners.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.468
It's always a concern when
doing an invasive procedure.

17:48.501 --> 17:49.869
I'm sorry, I should know.

17:49.902 --> 17:54.541
His pharmacist would have
all his medications on record.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.144
Of course, um...

17:57.177 --> 17:59.212
Fort Hamilton Chemist.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.714
I'm gonna call
them right now.

18:01.748 --> 18:02.815
Thank you.

18:02.849 --> 18:04.217
Do you mind if I...

18:23.903 --> 18:26.273
(sniffles)

18:26.306 --> 18:29.309
(sighs)

18:29.342 --> 18:31.344
(sniffles)

18:37.750 --> 18:40.320
ERIN:
Well, are you sure

18:40.353 --> 18:42.655
you don't want me
to come down there?

18:42.689 --> 18:44.591
All right.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.260
I'll call you when
I get back to the office,

18:47.294 --> 18:49.329
but if anything changes,
will you call me?

18:49.362 --> 18:52.432
All right, I love you, too, Dad.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.736
Who is it?

18:56.769 --> 18:58.938
My grandfather. They think
he just had a heart attack.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.408
I'm so sorry.
They're...

19:01.441 --> 19:03.910
they're saying that he'll
probably be all right, I just...

19:03.943 --> 19:05.712
I mean, of all the things
I'm thinking about,

19:05.745 --> 19:07.380
it's... Thanksgiving.

19:07.414 --> 19:09.482
It's his favorite holiday,
and he...
Please...

19:09.516 --> 19:11.251
go if you need to.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.586
No, there's nothing I can do.

19:13.620 --> 19:16.256
And Dad has given
his orders, so...

19:17.924 --> 19:19.659
Maybe I could just
have a cup of tea.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.394
Excuse me.

19:21.428 --> 19:22.695
Tea, please?

19:22.729 --> 19:23.896
WAITER:
Right away.

19:26.699 --> 19:30.237
So, I ran into a mutual friend
of ours today.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.639
Detective DeLeon.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.574
Art Theft Division.

19:35.875 --> 19:38.245
Erin, I'm not a thief.

19:38.278 --> 19:40.280
Well, that's funny,
because NYPD,

19:40.313 --> 19:42.682
Interpol,
Scotland Yard,
half a dozen

19:42.715 --> 19:44.384
other agencies disagree.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.419
I am innocent.
And I am

19:46.453 --> 19:48.721
an assistant district attorney
for the City of New York.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.623
Do you know
how many times a day

19:50.657 --> 19:53.460
I hear those three words?

19:56.429 --> 19:57.930
Tell me something, Erin.

19:57.964 --> 20:00.767
What's the most important thing
in the world to you?

20:00.800 --> 20:02.269
A possession,

20:02.302 --> 20:03.703
not a person.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.338
You're changing
the subject, Jacob.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.473
No, I' m not.

20:07.674 --> 20:10.443
Okay.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.946
This.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.783
My mother gave it to me

20:16.816 --> 20:18.718
for my 16th birthday.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.453
Like mother, like daughter.

20:20.487 --> 20:21.621
Beautiful.

20:21.654 --> 20:25.392
She said, "When you wear this,

20:25.425 --> 20:28.961
I will always be
close to your heart."

20:28.995 --> 20:31.964
Suppose somebody
stole this locket,

20:31.998 --> 20:34.267
and I got it back for you.

20:34.301 --> 20:36.436
Would you consider
me the thief?

20:36.469 --> 20:38.338
How did you get it back?

20:38.371 --> 20:40.873
Would that really be
the question you'd ask?

20:43.610 --> 20:45.845
When the Nazis invaded Europe,

20:45.878 --> 20:47.847
they stripped
the Jews of everything.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.849
I help in returning

20:49.882 --> 20:51.584
what's rightfully theirs.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.686
But I do not steal.

20:55.955 --> 20:58.858
DANNY:
Linda, of course
he's gonna pull through, okay?

20:58.891 --> 21:01.461
Look, I've seen that tough SOB

21:01.494 --> 21:02.762
drop two perps to their knees

21:02.795 --> 21:04.897
using nothing more than
the evil eye, all right?

21:04.931 --> 21:07.467
It's gonna take a lot more
than a heart attack

21:07.500 --> 21:08.835
to stop that old tank.

21:11.338 --> 21:13.039
Trust me, I amright.

21:15.007 --> 21:17.710
Listen, let me take care
of what I got to do here, okay,

21:17.744 --> 21:19.011
and then I'll be right over.

21:19.045 --> 21:21.448
I promise. Yeah.

21:21.481 --> 21:25.385
Hey, thank you for saving
my grandpa's life, all right?

21:25.418 --> 21:27.387
Love you more.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.494
Thanks for coming in.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.463
Sorry, uh, about
the circumstances.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.097
Yeah, thanks.

21:38.130 --> 21:42.101
Um, you and Ayla,
you two seeing each other long?

21:42.134 --> 21:43.870
About three or
four months.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.638
Things getting serious
with you two?

21:45.672 --> 21:47.440
Yeah.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.041
I mean, Ayla was
an amazing girl.

21:49.075 --> 21:51.511
Really special.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.746
Uh-huh. When was
the last time you spoke to her?

21:53.780 --> 21:55.515
Last night.
In person?

21:55.548 --> 21:56.749
No. She called me.

21:56.783 --> 21:58.418
She was really upset.

21:58.451 --> 22:00.620
She and her brother
had been arguing again.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.622
They argue a lot, those two?

22:02.655 --> 22:05.492
(sighs):
Ayla was East Indian.

22:05.525 --> 22:07.494
And in the old
Bombay culture,

22:07.527 --> 22:10.129
women are expected
to follow certain rules.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.665
Mm-hmm, rules
about dating Western guys?

22:12.699 --> 22:15.702
Her brother enforced
those rules.

22:15.735 --> 22:17.136
Yeah, I bet he did.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.372
All right, sit tight, okay?

22:19.406 --> 22:20.740
All right.

22:20.773 --> 22:24.877
Oh... Where were you
this morning, Kurt?

22:24.911 --> 22:26.112
When?

22:26.145 --> 22:28.381
When your girlfriend died.

22:28.415 --> 22:31.484
(sighs)
Radio City Music Hall.

22:31.518 --> 22:32.952
My parents were in
from Palm Beach,

22:32.985 --> 22:36.623
so I took them
to see the Christmas special.

22:37.624 --> 22:38.925
And your parents
will confirm that?

22:38.958 --> 22:40.560
Sure.

22:40.593 --> 22:43.596
Okay. So you wouldn't mind,
uh, writing down their number

22:43.630 --> 22:44.664
for me, would you?
No.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.666
You know, just to confirm.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.000
Of course.

22:53.039 --> 22:55.942
(car horn beeps)

22:55.975 --> 22:57.944
I thought you said you
wanted to eat healthier.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.646
I just saw a 22-year-old girl

22:59.679 --> 23:01.681
take a swan dive
from the 17th floor.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.950
And it reminds me
that you only live once.

23:03.983 --> 23:05.117
(phone ringing)
Right.

23:05.151 --> 23:07.820
I got to take this.

23:07.854 --> 23:10.457
Get me some more sauerkraut,
more onions?

23:10.490 --> 23:12.492
You got it.

23:12.525 --> 23:15.562
Listen, I was
gonna call you.

23:15.595 --> 23:16.829
Let's tone it down, okay?

23:16.863 --> 23:18.164
We could talk about this.

23:18.197 --> 23:20.900
That's not gonna happen...
not by tomorrow.

23:20.933 --> 23:23.836
I'm gonna need some
more time here. Please.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.572
What?

23:25.605 --> 23:27.039
What you...?
(stammering) Wait, you...

23:27.073 --> 23:28.508
You're gonna
threaten me now?

23:28.541 --> 23:30.610
Oh, yeah? Hello?

23:30.643 --> 23:32.011
Hello?!

23:37.584 --> 23:40.687
Want to clue me in to what's
going on with you here?

23:40.720 --> 23:44.624
I owe some money, and I ain't
got the money to pay him back.

23:44.657 --> 23:46.493
So ask for an extension.

23:46.526 --> 23:47.960
This guy doesn't work in a bank.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.962
Phew!

23:49.996 --> 23:51.964
Does this have anything to do
with you flipping right

23:51.998 --> 23:54.133
to the racing pages
whenever you take my paper?

23:54.166 --> 23:56.202
I gamble a little.

23:56.235 --> 23:57.504
And lately you lost?

23:57.537 --> 23:59.572
I lost a lot.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.240
I'm three grand
in the hole to my bookie.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.642
Phew!

24:02.675 --> 24:04.677
I could do
without the "Phew."

24:05.745 --> 24:08.014
So what are you gonna do?

24:10.082 --> 24:12.652
You know,
that's the $3,000 question.

24:12.685 --> 24:15.054
Phew.

24:15.087 --> 24:17.757
JTTF and Homeland
Security are in accord.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.692
There's no reason to
raise the threat level

24:19.726 --> 24:20.527
based on current intel.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.128
The mayor's
been informed?
Yes, sir.

24:22.161 --> 24:24.163
Uh, Joint Terrorism Task
Force will be updating us

24:24.196 --> 24:26.265
as necessary, but for
now, it's good news.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.668
(sighs) I'll take it
where I can get it.

24:30.603 --> 24:32.605
Thanks, Baker.

24:37.209 --> 24:39.546
I've gone over your father's
meds with a cardiologist.

24:39.579 --> 24:40.780
We're good to go.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.081
The list is complete?

24:42.114 --> 24:43.550
Yeah, I called,
and I double-checked

24:43.583 --> 24:45.952
at the pharmacy
as soon as the fax came in.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.120
We'll be moving him down
to the O.R. shortly.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.288
This...

24:49.321 --> 24:51.591
cardiologist...

24:51.624 --> 24:52.725
Dr. Durrell.

24:52.759 --> 24:54.293
I don't know him.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.596
Yes... he's the best.

24:56.629 --> 24:58.765
I'm not trying
to go around anybody here.

24:58.798 --> 25:01.968
He's done literally
thousands of these.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.636
But you understand
what I'm asking?

25:03.670 --> 25:05.972
Yes, I do, and
I'd be asking

25:06.005 --> 25:08.040
the exact same question
if I were in your shoes.

25:08.074 --> 25:09.642
He's the best?

25:09.676 --> 25:11.644
You have my word.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.719
All that's left is
to say a prayer.

25:21.253 --> 25:23.255
Right now, God goes
by the name of Durrell.

25:31.864 --> 25:32.632
DANNY:
We'll be as quick

25:32.665 --> 25:33.633
as we can,
Mr. and Mrs. Freelander,

25:33.666 --> 25:36.035
though we may,
and I emphasize the word "may,"

25:36.068 --> 25:38.638
be looking at a murder
investigation here.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.139
Murder?

25:40.172 --> 25:42.074
Thought we were talking
about suicide.

25:42.108 --> 25:43.676
Well, things have changed.

25:43.710 --> 25:46.278
Uh, did your son Kurt
not tell you about that?

25:46.312 --> 25:48.014
Look, we can tell you

25:48.047 --> 25:50.349
that Kurt had nothing
to do with this girl's death.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.051
We were with him all day.

25:52.084 --> 25:53.219
Hmm.

25:53.252 --> 25:54.721
At, uh, Radio
City Music Hall?

25:54.754 --> 25:56.589
Yes. Wonderful show.

25:56.623 --> 25:57.990
And before that,
we had lunch,

25:58.024 --> 25:59.692
then a walk in Central Park.

25:59.726 --> 26:02.595
Mm-hmm. Have you ever met
Kurt's girlfriend?

26:02.629 --> 26:04.597
Well, he's had
a few girlfriends.

26:04.631 --> 26:05.865
MR. FREELANDER:
Single straight

26:05.898 --> 26:07.634
man in New York City--

26:07.667 --> 26:09.902
we understand they're
in short supply.

26:09.936 --> 26:11.804
MRS. FREELANDER:
But I do remember
the Indian girl.

26:11.838 --> 26:14.674
I think we met her last
time we were in town.

26:14.707 --> 26:15.942
So, uh, let me ask you.

26:15.975 --> 26:19.712
Is this the girl that you were
talking about? An Ayla Demir?

26:19.746 --> 26:21.247
It wasn't that girl.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.849
Well, who is the girl?

26:22.882 --> 26:27.119
God, I just knew this was
all going to turn out to be

26:27.153 --> 26:30.389
one big misunderstanding.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.191
That's her.

26:32.224 --> 26:33.693
That's the girl we met.

26:37.396 --> 26:39.031
May I?

26:39.065 --> 26:42.234
Just going to e-mail this
to myself if you don't mind.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.170
What for?
Well, because

26:44.203 --> 26:47.373
this is a picture of your son
with the victim's sister, and...

26:47.406 --> 26:50.376
that does kind of complicate
things just a little bit, ma'am.

27:03.756 --> 27:06.759
(indistinct P.A. announcement)

27:06.793 --> 27:09.261
(indistinct voices)

27:12.064 --> 27:14.066
(phone rings)

27:23.342 --> 27:24.677
Hey, good news.
Yeah.

27:24.711 --> 27:25.778
Daddy just texted me.

27:25.812 --> 27:27.446
He's on his way downtown,
and he's gonna stop by.

27:27.479 --> 27:28.815
Oh.
Good.

27:28.848 --> 27:32.051
Have you eaten anything?

27:32.084 --> 27:34.887
I'll get something later.

27:34.921 --> 27:37.790
Pastrami sandwiches coming up.

27:42.394 --> 27:43.462
Hi, Garrett.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.698
Hey.

27:45.732 --> 27:47.433
Please don't ask me
how I'm doing.

27:47.466 --> 27:49.368
I wasn't planning to.

27:49.401 --> 27:52.004
I brought you a fresh shirt
and a dopp kit.

27:52.038 --> 27:54.040
Thank you.

27:55.742 --> 27:58.477
I'm like a rabbit's
foot in hospitals.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.179
I always bring good luck.

28:00.212 --> 28:02.915
That's good to know.

28:04.951 --> 28:07.319
So, how you doing?

28:07.353 --> 28:09.688
I told you not to ask me that.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.925
How am I doing?

28:14.927 --> 28:18.030
When my mom got sick,
my dad slept in a plastic chair

28:18.064 --> 28:20.432
in her hospital room
for three weeks.

28:20.466 --> 28:23.235
Only time he went home
was to cook her meals

28:23.269 --> 28:25.772
because he didn't trust
the hospital food.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.843
At the time,
I did not understand.

28:31.844 --> 28:33.445
So now you do.

28:33.479 --> 28:35.281
(footsteps approaching)

28:43.856 --> 28:45.357
Good news.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.426
The angioplasty went well.

28:47.459 --> 28:49.461
(sighs)

28:49.495 --> 28:51.497
(laughs)

28:52.799 --> 28:54.466
Thank you.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.402
Your father had
a clot that was

28:56.435 --> 28:58.537
preventing blood flow
to his heart.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.406
We managed
to remove the blockage,

29:00.439 --> 29:02.875
and he's recovering nicely.

29:02.909 --> 29:05.344
Thank you, Doctor.

29:05.377 --> 29:06.946
Told you. Rabbit's foot.

29:06.979 --> 29:07.847
(laughing)

29:07.880 --> 29:11.851
You should be able
to see him shortly.

29:11.884 --> 29:14.787
See, boys? It was
nothing to worry about.

29:23.896 --> 29:25.898
(sighs)

29:31.303 --> 29:33.305
Hey, Dad, buy you
a cup of coffee?

29:39.178 --> 29:41.080
What you're telling us--
it's not possible.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.882
(Jackie clears her throat)

29:42.915 --> 29:45.784
Kurt's mother showed us
this photo.

29:50.923 --> 29:53.525
This can't be.
This can't be.

29:53.559 --> 29:54.861
(door opening)

29:54.894 --> 29:56.195
(door closes)

30:00.299 --> 30:01.934
MRS. DEMIR:
What did you

30:01.968 --> 30:03.535
do to your sister?

30:04.636 --> 30:05.972
You stupid slut!

30:06.005 --> 30:07.940
Hey, hey.
Oh, oh, whoa.

30:07.974 --> 30:09.341
Take it easy.

30:09.375 --> 30:12.111
Just relax.

30:12.144 --> 30:15.447
(crying):
I'm sorry.

30:15.481 --> 30:17.316
(crying):
How could you do that to her?

30:17.349 --> 30:18.885
I didn't do anything.

30:18.918 --> 30:21.453
It just... happened.

30:22.554 --> 30:24.456
When I met Kurt,

30:24.490 --> 30:26.425
he was with Ayla, and we...

30:26.458 --> 30:28.160
And you what?!
You what?!

30:28.194 --> 30:30.329
(sobbing)

30:30.362 --> 30:33.132
You don't control who
you fall in love with, Mother.

30:33.165 --> 30:36.102
(crying)
It just happens.

30:36.135 --> 30:38.270
How could you take
your sister's boyfriend?

30:39.939 --> 30:41.240
Did you see Ayla this morning?

30:42.441 --> 30:45.044
No.

30:45.077 --> 30:47.446
You don't believe this
is a suicide, do you?

30:47.479 --> 30:49.081
(crying)

30:49.115 --> 30:51.317
I don't know.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.584
(crying)
DANNY:
Okay.

30:52.618 --> 30:54.586
Did Kurt see Ayla this morning?

30:56.255 --> 30:57.589
Answer the question!
Hey.

30:57.623 --> 31:00.893
He was supposed
to talk to her today.

31:00.927 --> 31:03.963
He was going
to tell her about us.

31:03.996 --> 31:05.564
You mean, Kurt went
to Ayla's apartment?

31:05.597 --> 31:07.599
(crying)

31:17.609 --> 31:20.146
When we were upstairs,
it's funny.

31:20.179 --> 31:22.949
I was thinking about
when I broke up with Sydney.

31:22.982 --> 31:27.186
I had no place to go,
so I just show up at the house,

31:27.219 --> 31:29.455
and hang out with Grandpa.

31:29.488 --> 31:33.159
We were like two single guys
just hanging out.

31:36.528 --> 31:38.664
It's funny the things
you think about.

31:41.300 --> 31:44.036
Something's bothering
you besides Pop.

31:44.070 --> 31:46.472
Unlike Danny,

31:46.505 --> 31:48.574
you never had
a very good poker face.

31:48.607 --> 31:51.978
Yeah, that's why he was able
to blame me for everything.

31:52.011 --> 31:54.913
What is it?

31:55.747 --> 31:58.184
I'm talking to you as my dad,

31:58.217 --> 32:00.186
not as the police commissioner.

32:00.219 --> 32:03.055
I am your dad.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.592
I know this guy on the job

32:06.625 --> 32:08.360
who's upside down
with his bookie.

32:08.394 --> 32:10.062
He owes him three grand.

32:10.096 --> 32:11.697
He's a really good guy,

32:11.730 --> 32:12.731
and I want to help him out.

32:12.764 --> 32:15.501
This really good guy
have a name?

32:15.534 --> 32:17.669
I'd rather not.

32:17.703 --> 32:20.006
Help him how?

32:20.039 --> 32:23.675
I was thinking that I couldtalk
to the bookie for him.

32:23.709 --> 32:25.744
Maybe I broker
some kind of deal

32:25.777 --> 32:27.980
for him
to pay back what he owes.

32:28.014 --> 32:29.748
When you work undercover,
how can you know

32:29.781 --> 32:32.451
that the bookie won't have
traveled in the same circles?

32:35.121 --> 32:37.389
Yeah, that's probably stupid
five different ways.

32:37.423 --> 32:39.158
At least.

32:43.462 --> 32:45.564
Could I borrow the money
from you, then?

32:45.597 --> 32:48.067
Make sure you get paid back.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.603
This means that much to you?

32:51.637 --> 32:55.007
He's like family.

32:56.508 --> 32:58.510
(sighs)

33:03.582 --> 33:05.217
ADA Reagan?

33:07.153 --> 33:08.654
You actually

33:08.687 --> 33:10.422
followed me here?

33:10.456 --> 33:11.790
Oh, well, not followed.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.792
I just found out where you were.

33:13.825 --> 33:14.860
Well, if you don't mind,

33:14.893 --> 33:16.795
I just found out my grandfather
pulled through...

33:16.828 --> 33:19.365
A painting was stolen from
the Windom in the hour or so

33:19.398 --> 33:20.666
after it
closed today.

33:20.699 --> 33:21.733
An oil-on-panel called

33:21.767 --> 33:23.769
The Sky at St. Alban.

33:23.802 --> 33:25.104
I'm sorry to hear that.

33:25.137 --> 33:26.505
It's a Jules Boché.

33:26.538 --> 33:29.741
It was displayed
in a Polish museum until 1944,

33:29.775 --> 33:31.810
when it disappeared
during the German occupation.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.780
Turned up again in 2009
in a private collection,

33:34.813 --> 33:39.551
from which it was on loan
to the Windom.

33:39.585 --> 33:42.488
And I'm guessing
the provenance is in dispute.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.056
That's not the point.
No.

33:44.090 --> 33:46.158
It's not the point.
What exactly is the point?

33:46.192 --> 33:48.460
Well, Jacob Krystal was
at the Windom

33:48.494 --> 33:50.796
the day he met you,
and again this afternoon,

33:50.829 --> 33:52.464
right up until closing.

33:52.498 --> 33:54.266
Yeah, Detective, you're going
to need a whole lot more

33:54.300 --> 33:55.601
than that
if you're gonna nail him.

33:55.634 --> 33:57.069
I know.

33:57.103 --> 33:59.171
That's why I'm here.

34:01.307 --> 34:02.574
Will you help us?

34:10.816 --> 34:12.784
(footsteps approaching)

34:12.818 --> 34:14.586
Hot pastrami
sandwiches.

34:14.620 --> 34:17.289
Hey.

34:18.324 --> 34:20.392
Thank you.

34:20.426 --> 34:22.694
When are you gonna tell Grandpa
about Thanksgiving?

34:22.728 --> 34:24.763
(sighs)
I don't know.

34:26.198 --> 34:30.169
So you know you're not
the only hero in the family.

34:30.202 --> 34:32.504
No, your wife saved Grandpa.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.106
Oh, come on.
Yeah? Imagine that.

34:34.140 --> 34:36.542
He's not even the first
Reagan man she saved.

34:36.575 --> 34:37.643
Who's the first?

34:37.676 --> 34:38.810
Me.

34:38.844 --> 34:40.546
(laughing)

34:41.547 --> 34:42.714
(quiet laughter)

34:44.350 --> 34:45.817
Excuse me.

34:45.851 --> 34:48.354
Yeah, I'm gonna have
to take mine to go, too, sis.

34:49.821 --> 34:51.190
Got to get back
to the office.

34:51.223 --> 34:53.225
I'll see you, Gramps.

34:56.262 --> 34:57.563
My grandmother's recipe.

34:57.596 --> 34:58.797
Cornbread and sausage.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.332
That's very kind of you, sir.

35:00.366 --> 35:02.334
Don't mention it.
How's your dad doing?

35:02.368 --> 35:04.203
Recovering nicely, thank you.
Good.

35:04.236 --> 35:06.372
I understand you've been here
at the hospital all day.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.174
Maybe you're not aware
of the updates.

35:08.207 --> 35:10.542
I'm aware of the updates.

35:10.576 --> 35:12.444
Frank, with everything going on
with your father,

35:12.478 --> 35:14.613
maybe you'd like to delegate
these decisions right now.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.384
Is there someone you trust
to handle this tonight?

35:18.417 --> 35:20.886
Yes. You're looking at him.

35:20.919 --> 35:22.888
That's what
I was hoping to hear.

35:22.921 --> 35:24.856
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

35:24.890 --> 35:26.858
Happy Thanksgiving, Frank.

35:26.892 --> 35:28.894
And to you.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.770
(sighs)

35:42.974 --> 35:44.776
(groans)

35:44.810 --> 35:45.844
Happy Thanksgiving.

35:45.877 --> 35:47.346
It will be

35:47.379 --> 35:50.416
when you wheel me out of here.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.620
You've been there
all night?
Oh, I got

35:54.653 --> 35:56.822
so used to you snoring,
I probably wouldn't have been

35:56.855 --> 35:58.490
able to sleep
at home without it.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.626
(sighs)
Pay the bill and check me out.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.794
Pop...

36:03.995 --> 36:05.497
...you're gonna have to stay put

36:05.531 --> 36:07.466
so the nurses
can keep an eye on you.

36:07.499 --> 36:08.734
Nonsense.

36:08.767 --> 36:10.636
Never missed a Thanksgiving
dinner in my life.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.438
I'm not about to start now.

36:12.471 --> 36:14.940
Doctor's orders, Pop.

36:14.973 --> 36:16.542
Get my things!

36:16.575 --> 36:18.344
First of all, calm down.

36:18.377 --> 36:19.811
And second of all,

36:19.845 --> 36:21.880
you're staying put.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.987
DANNY:
Excuse us.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.657
Good morning.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.459
Happy Thanksgiving.

36:33.492 --> 36:35.294
Hello, Freelanders.

36:35.327 --> 36:37.296
On Thanksgiving?
DANNY:
Well, you know,

36:37.329 --> 36:38.797
justice knows no holiday, ma'am.

36:38.830 --> 36:40.266
I'm sorry?

36:40.299 --> 36:41.600
We're gonna need you all
to come with us.

36:41.633 --> 36:43.001
MRS. FREELANDER:
What are you talking about?

36:43.034 --> 36:45.371
This is absurd.
DANNY:
No, what's absurd is you

36:45.404 --> 36:47.005
and your husband lying to the
police to cover up for your son.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.640
We know he wasn't at

36:48.674 --> 36:49.975
Radio City Music Hall.

36:50.008 --> 36:53.745
We know you went
to Ayla's apartment.

36:53.779 --> 36:55.514
You're looking at manslaughter,
kid. Get on your feet.

36:56.515 --> 36:57.616
Get up.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.551
And obstruction of justice
for you two.

36:59.585 --> 37:00.619
It was an accident.

37:00.652 --> 37:02.654
Shut up!
Don't say anything else.

37:02.688 --> 37:03.922
I'm so sorry.

37:03.955 --> 37:06.825
I went over to her apartment to
talk to her about me and Mehlia,

37:06.858 --> 37:08.494
and she got so mad,
she started

37:08.527 --> 37:10.629
pushing me,
and I pushed her back.

37:10.662 --> 37:11.797
Kurt!

37:11.830 --> 37:14.333
Right out the open window?

37:14.366 --> 37:15.434
Let's go.

37:15.467 --> 37:16.668
Come on.

37:16.702 --> 37:18.337
Let's go.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.272
Sorry to disturb your
Thanksgiving brunch, everyone.

37:20.306 --> 37:22.308
Enjoy your desserts.

37:22.341 --> 37:24.943
(diners murmuring)

37:27.946 --> 37:30.382
Uh, Commissioner?

37:30.416 --> 37:32.851
Morning, Tony.

37:32.884 --> 37:35.020
Yeah, good morning.

37:35.053 --> 37:36.422
Oh, please sit down.

37:36.455 --> 37:37.556
Oh.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.591
Thanks.

37:45.664 --> 37:46.832
Want some coffee?

37:46.865 --> 37:48.634
No, I'm good.

37:53.004 --> 37:55.607
You were my son's
field training officer.

37:55.641 --> 37:57.609
In many ways,

37:57.643 --> 37:58.577
you're his mentor.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.045
Now you're his supervisor.

38:00.078 --> 38:01.480
Commissioner, I...?

38:01.513 --> 38:03.615
I need your help.

38:04.650 --> 38:05.951
(sighs)

38:05.984 --> 38:07.886
I'm worried about Jamie.

38:07.919 --> 38:11.390
He came to me,

38:11.423 --> 38:13.392
and he wanted
to borrow some money

38:13.425 --> 38:15.361
to pay off some gambling debts.

38:15.394 --> 38:17.663
Pretty sizable amount.

38:17.696 --> 38:19.631
Is that right?

38:19.665 --> 38:21.767
Yeah.

38:21.800 --> 38:26.071
On his best day, a cop needs
to have all the integrity

38:26.104 --> 38:28.640
he can muster
when there's a pile of money

38:28.674 --> 38:30.376
sitting on the table
after some drug bust.

38:30.409 --> 38:31.710
How's he going
to do that

38:31.743 --> 38:34.012
if he's in the hole three grand
to some bookie?

38:34.045 --> 38:36.014
I'm sure, uh...

38:36.047 --> 38:39.851
he never meant for it
to get out of hand.

38:41.953 --> 38:44.356
So I loaned him the money.

38:45.724 --> 38:48.627
But there wouldn't
be anything

38:48.660 --> 38:51.663
I could do
to help him out a second time.

38:51.697 --> 38:53.999
It's important to me

38:54.032 --> 38:56.502
that you understand
the situation.

38:56.535 --> 38:58.670
Yes, sir.

39:06.645 --> 39:08.547
Would you keep a sharp eye
on him?

39:08.580 --> 39:10.549
You have my word, sir.

39:10.582 --> 39:12.618
Happy Thanksgiving, Tony.

39:12.651 --> 39:14.653
And to you, too, sir.

39:25.096 --> 39:26.898
Happy Thanksgiving.

39:26.932 --> 39:28.900
Jacob...

39:28.934 --> 39:30.669
you shouldn't be here.

39:30.702 --> 39:33.472
I made you something.

39:37.709 --> 39:41.447
Four years of art school,
I can still only draw in pencil.

39:41.480 --> 39:42.781
It's beautiful.

39:44.683 --> 39:47.653
I never meant
to put you in any danger.

39:47.686 --> 39:48.987
Just say the word,

39:49.020 --> 39:51.590
and you'll never see me again.

39:51.623 --> 39:53.959
You know there are other ways
to right this wrong.

39:53.992 --> 39:56.528
Like how? In the courts?
No offense,

39:56.562 --> 39:58.930
but lawyers have done
as much harm to my cause

39:58.964 --> 40:00.632
as the original thieves did.

40:00.666 --> 40:03.802
Yeah, but what-what do you want
from me, Jacob?

40:05.170 --> 40:07.205
A little faith.

40:07.238 --> 40:09.441
(sighs)

40:25.256 --> 40:29.661
(indistinct sportscast plays)

40:29.695 --> 40:30.862
Thought I told you to go home.

40:30.896 --> 40:33.765
I did go home, but you made me
feel guilty, so I'm back.

40:33.799 --> 40:36.535
Here.
Where are we going?

40:36.568 --> 40:39.705
To the cafeteria
to get a turkey sandwich.

40:39.738 --> 40:42.908
Whoever heard of turkey dinner
out of a vending machine?

40:42.941 --> 40:45.143
Beggars can't be choosers,
and you're full of it.

40:45.176 --> 40:47.145
This isn't the first
Thanksgiving dinner you missed.

40:47.178 --> 40:48.947
I beg your pardon.

40:48.980 --> 40:51.717
You missed 'cause of Korea,
you missed when Mom was sick.

40:51.750 --> 40:54.219
I missed twice in the Marines.
And Danny in Fallujah.

40:54.252 --> 40:56.054
Erin with pneumonia.
LINDA:
Shh! Shh!

40:56.087 --> 40:59.090
ALL:
Happy Thanksgiving!

40:59.124 --> 41:00.759
(cheering)

41:00.792 --> 41:03.194
(laughs)

41:03.228 --> 41:05.697
Hello.

41:05.731 --> 41:08.166
So good to see you.
Hi.

41:08.199 --> 41:12.538
What, are you trying to give me
another heart attack?

41:12.571 --> 41:13.539
(laughter)

41:13.572 --> 41:15.641
FRANK:
Well,

41:15.674 --> 41:19.010
it ain't the Reagan dining room,
but under the circumstances...

41:19.044 --> 41:20.812
LINDA:
I know we couldn't be home

41:20.846 --> 41:22.180
this year, but that doesn't mean

41:22.213 --> 41:24.816
a little bit of home
can't be with us.

41:24.850 --> 41:26.752
My turkey platter.

41:26.785 --> 41:28.854
(laughter)

41:28.887 --> 41:30.789
It's nice to see you
smile again, Grandpa.

41:30.822 --> 41:32.791
That's...

41:32.824 --> 41:34.893
just the drugs talking.

41:34.926 --> 41:36.795
DANNY:
Yeah, well...
(clears throat)

41:36.828 --> 41:38.897
Thanksgiving wouldn't have been
the same without you, Gramps.

41:41.232 --> 41:43.969
Not by a long shot.

41:44.002 --> 41:47.238
Glad you could make it, Pop.

41:52.243 --> 41:54.880
If it's okay with you guys,

41:54.913 --> 41:56.915
I'd like to say grace.

41:58.984 --> 42:00.952
Heavenly Father,

42:00.986 --> 42:03.989
on this Thanksgiving Day,

42:04.022 --> 42:07.926
we give pause
to give thanks to you

42:07.959 --> 42:10.295
for your many blessings.

42:10.328 --> 42:12.631
For Linda.

42:17.769 --> 42:21.272
For this food which we are about
to receive from your bounty.

42:21.306 --> 42:24.710
For your love.

42:24.743 --> 42:26.912
To Dr. Durrell.

42:26.945 --> 42:30.015
And for all those
less fortunate

42:30.048 --> 42:32.718
in this season of giving,
and for those who opened

42:32.751 --> 42:34.953
their door to them,

42:34.986 --> 42:37.088
and for the loving family
at this table.

42:37.122 --> 42:39.357
Amen.

42:39.390 --> 42:43.061
ALL:
Amen.

42:44.963 --> 42:47.032
I'm hungry.

42:47.065 --> 42:49.601
This is the mayor's stuffing.

42:49.635 --> 42:50.836
Let's eat.
Pass the rolls.

42:50.869 --> 42:53.338
Jack and Sean, getyour napkins
on your plate... your laps.
