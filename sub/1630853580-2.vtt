WEBVTT

00:00.909 --> 00:01.783
(upbeat music playing)

00:04.079 --> 00:06.747
Well, Texas has been fun,

00:06.823 --> 00:08.156
but it's time
for this supervillain family

00:08.234 --> 00:11.176
to hide out in some other
unsuspecting suburb.

00:11.253 --> 00:12.127
Who's up for Sheboygan?

00:14.256 --> 00:15.405
We can go wherever you want.

00:15.407 --> 00:16.331
We just got to move quick.

00:16.408 --> 00:17.182
I've done some things.

00:19.595 --> 00:21.745
Why are we leaving now?

00:21.747 --> 00:23.597
We have no choice.
We're not safe here

00:23.673 --> 00:25.840
since Amy told Hartley
our secret.

00:25.918 --> 00:26.767
Come on. Do you really think
she'd tell anyone?

00:26.843 --> 00:28.602
We can't take that risk.

00:28.678 --> 00:31.179
She tells one person
we're villains,

00:31.257 --> 00:32.680
the authorities
will lock us up forever.

00:32.758 --> 00:34.441
Oh, that's if Onyx

00:34.518 --> 00:35.926
doesn't find us
and destroy us first.

00:35.928 --> 00:38.762
I say we move to the beach
so I can scare some surfers

00:38.764 --> 00:44.117
by shape shifting into a shark
or a man eating crab.

00:44.194 --> 00:45.118
Either way,
I'm snacking on someone.

00:47.122 --> 00:48.881
We can't leave.

00:48.957 --> 00:49.773
We finally started
going to school

00:49.775 --> 00:51.699
and I like it.

00:51.777 --> 00:53.201
You know,
I'm the first student

00:53.279 --> 00:54.778
at Valley View High
to be nominated

00:54.780 --> 00:55.721
for Student of the Month
after being here

00:55.798 --> 00:56.555
less than a month.

00:56.632 --> 00:58.632
Oh, Jakey.

00:58.708 --> 01:00.559
I don't know how you do it,

01:00.636 --> 01:01.551
but you always find a way
to disappoint us.

01:04.807 --> 01:05.472
I knew it! She ratted us out.

01:05.549 --> 01:06.640
Save yourself!

01:08.477 --> 01:09.626
It's just Hartley.

01:09.628 --> 01:12.129
Oh, wow.

01:12.131 --> 01:12.562
She really snuck up on us,
didn't she?

01:13.723 --> 01:16.408
Good morning.

01:16.485 --> 01:17.801
How are my favorite
supervillains?

01:17.803 --> 01:20.061
Wait, wait, wait.

01:20.139 --> 01:21.471
I was up all night
thinking about it.

01:21.473 --> 01:23.231
And I have so many questions.

01:23.309 --> 01:25.066
Have you met Captain Valor?

01:25.144 --> 01:27.327
I heard his real name is Doug.

01:27.404 --> 01:28.812
And what about Sparkle Girl?

01:28.814 --> 01:32.207
I heard she smells like truth,
justice, and coconuts.

01:34.153 --> 01:37.930
Hartley, we would love
to answer all your questions,

01:38.006 --> 01:39.656
but just now's not really
the best time.

01:39.658 --> 01:41.082
They're still,
kind of, processing

01:41.160 --> 01:42.342
the fact that you know
our secret.

01:42.419 --> 01:45.104
Oh, what's wrong?
Don't you trust me?

01:45.180 --> 01:46.496
Of course we do.

01:46.498 --> 01:49.108
In fact we trust you so much
we wanna lock you

01:49.184 --> 01:49.933
in a medium sized box
and never let you out.

01:52.504 --> 01:53.019
I'm gonna head out.

01:55.357 --> 01:57.282
See you at school.

01:57.359 --> 01:58.692
I can't believe
you don't trust Hartley.

01:58.768 --> 02:01.102
She's a good person.

02:01.180 --> 02:02.788
Yeah, a little too good
and honest.

02:02.865 --> 02:06.533
It's gonna make it impossible
for her to keep our secret.

02:06.610 --> 02:08.293
Now that I think about it,
Dad might be right.

02:08.370 --> 02:10.963
Did you know she's never lied
to her grandmother ever?

02:11.039 --> 02:13.540
(chuckles)
Well, that does it for me.

02:13.617 --> 02:14.449
I can't trust anyone
that doesn't lie

02:14.526 --> 02:14.958
to their own family.

02:17.621 --> 02:19.805
Wait, does that mean
you lie to me?

02:19.882 --> 02:22.132
(scoffs) No.

02:24.870 --> 02:26.461
It would make it a lot easier
to trust her

02:26.538 --> 02:28.796
if we had something
to hold over her.

02:28.874 --> 02:31.541
That way, she'd be forced
to keep our secret.

02:31.543 --> 02:33.877
Are you actually
suggesting blackmail?

02:33.879 --> 02:35.478
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hartley's my friend.

02:36.973 --> 02:39.324
If anyone's gonna blackmail her,
it's gonna be me.

02:39.401 --> 02:42.402
Yeah.

02:42.479 --> 02:43.478
I was thinking maybe
someone else could do it.

02:43.555 --> 02:45.330
Why?

02:45.407 --> 02:47.407
Well, you did spill our secret.

02:47.484 --> 02:49.317
And let's not forget
the whole Onyx thing.

02:49.395 --> 02:51.837
What about the whole
"Onyx thing?"

02:51.914 --> 02:53.563
You went to go fight
for your mother's promotion.

02:53.565 --> 02:55.340
And now,
we're hiding out in Texas

02:55.417 --> 02:56.416
making small talk with neighbors
named Kai.

02:58.904 --> 03:00.237
Oh, so all of a sudden
everyone thinks

03:00.239 --> 03:02.664
I'm the mess up of the family?

03:02.741 --> 03:03.465
Not all of a sudden.
I've always thought that.

03:06.929 --> 03:08.345
Mom, you don't think
I'm a mess up, do you?

03:10.432 --> 03:11.306
No.

03:13.936 --> 03:15.176
I can't believe this.

03:15.254 --> 03:16.344
You're all wrong.

03:16.422 --> 03:17.754
I'm gonna prove it.

03:17.756 --> 03:18.697
I'm gonna blackmail Hartley.

03:18.774 --> 03:20.424
No, of course you are.

03:20.426 --> 03:22.868
Uh-hmm.
But just in case,

03:22.945 --> 03:24.703
how about some of us also see

03:24.780 --> 03:27.614
if we can dig up
some dirt on Hartley, hmm?

03:27.691 --> 03:28.856
Thanks, Mom, but I've got this.

03:28.934 --> 03:32.878
Yeah. But just in case.

03:32.955 --> 03:34.696
Do you seriously think
I can't do something

03:34.773 --> 03:36.456
as simple as
blackmailing Hartley?

03:36.533 --> 03:37.290
It's just in case.

03:39.795 --> 03:42.545
(theme music playing)

03:52.307 --> 03:53.473
(rock music playing)

03:56.645 --> 03:58.795
Okay. I've spotted the target.

03:58.797 --> 04:01.131
Time for operation,
"Blackmail Hartley

04:01.133 --> 04:03.558
and get my family
to trust me again."

04:03.635 --> 04:05.969
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:05.971 --> 04:06.486
Are you looking at me
like I'm weird?

04:08.991 --> 04:11.733
Hey, Hartley,

04:11.810 --> 04:13.418
didn't you and the Sunshine Club
have a carwash

04:13.495 --> 04:14.736
to raise money
for a new water fountain?

04:14.813 --> 04:17.238
Uh, yeah, we raised $500.

04:17.316 --> 04:19.907
Well then why is the old
water fountain still here?

04:19.985 --> 04:21.760
Where did all that money go,
Hartley?

04:21.837 --> 04:23.262
What kind of water
fountain crimes

04:23.338 --> 04:23.920
are you trying to pull here?

04:26.492 --> 04:28.158
What are you talking about?

04:28.160 --> 04:30.844
We had to give the money
to Kendall Rogers.

04:30.920 --> 04:31.603
She was scrubbing headlights
at the carwash

04:31.680 --> 04:34.514
and didn't move in time,

04:34.591 --> 04:37.017
took a custom grille
right to the forehead.

04:37.093 --> 04:39.260
Oh. (scoffs)

04:39.338 --> 04:40.428
I kind of wish I had seen that.

04:40.506 --> 04:43.765
But hey, being in charge
of all that money,

04:43.842 --> 04:45.692
don't you ever wanna just
take off

04:45.769 --> 04:47.527
and blow it all
on a tropical vacation?

04:47.604 --> 04:50.514
Amy, what's going on?

04:50.516 --> 04:51.281
Are you recording me?

04:52.684 --> 04:55.109
Uh...

04:55.187 --> 04:56.019
Dang, no!
I forgot to hit the button.

04:56.021 --> 04:56.244
Let's go from the top.

05:00.950 --> 05:04.136
Blackmailing Hartley's
gonna be tougher than I thought.

05:04.212 --> 05:06.863
Well then maybe
you should let it go.

05:06.865 --> 05:08.198
No way. I have to do it
so I can prove them

05:08.200 --> 05:10.383
I'm not the failure
of our family.

05:10.460 --> 05:11.134
That spot's clearly reserved
for you.

05:13.221 --> 05:14.796
Um, excuse me,
I'm not a failure.

05:14.873 --> 05:17.298
I just received three votes
for Student of the Month

05:17.376 --> 05:18.933
from the Valley View High
Librarian Squad.

05:23.882 --> 05:23.938
Okay. It seemed
a lot cooler in my head.

05:25.551 --> 05:27.326
You know what?

05:27.402 --> 05:29.494
I don't need to find something
to blackmail Hartley with.

05:29.571 --> 05:30.570
I can just plant something
on her.

05:30.647 --> 05:32.055
No, you can't.

05:32.057 --> 05:33.723
Oh, relax. I'm not really gonna
get her in trouble.

05:33.725 --> 05:35.983
I just have to plant
some evidence on her,

05:36.061 --> 05:37.669
catch her on camera with it,

05:37.746 --> 05:40.172
and then threaten
to get her in trouble.

05:40.248 --> 05:40.505
I just got to remember
to hit record this time.

05:43.402 --> 05:44.501
(upbeat music playing)

05:47.072 --> 05:49.072
Okay. This is Hartley's room.

05:49.074 --> 05:51.332
Are you sure Sealy is not home?

05:51.410 --> 05:53.668
Positive.
She said she's competing

05:53.745 --> 05:54.803
in a Backroom
Arm Wrestling Tournament.

05:57.082 --> 05:58.190
Oh, oh, so that explains why

05:58.266 --> 06:01.751
she was bench pressing Hartley
this morning.

06:01.753 --> 06:03.603
Okay. Come on.

06:03.680 --> 06:04.363
Let's see
if we can find something

06:04.439 --> 06:05.922
to blackmail Hartley with.

06:05.924 --> 06:11.428
I am hoping for a journal
full of juicy teen girl secrets.

06:11.430 --> 06:12.537
What has my life become?

06:18.453 --> 06:19.711
(gasps)

06:19.788 --> 06:21.380
Holy pigsty!

06:25.034 --> 06:26.292
This is usually
what the crime scene looks like

06:26.369 --> 06:27.043
after we leave.

06:29.205 --> 06:30.947
Someone's home.

06:30.949 --> 06:32.557
I thought you said Sealy was
at an arm wrestling tournament.

06:32.634 --> 06:34.559
She was.

06:34.636 --> 06:37.287
Oh, wait, that's tomorrow.

06:37.289 --> 06:37.729
Today she's home.

06:40.626 --> 06:41.400
She's coming. Hide! Go!

06:43.311 --> 06:45.904
-Let me in!
-There's no room.

06:45.981 --> 06:47.388
But where am I supposed to go?

06:47.466 --> 06:49.241
Go shape shift into something.

06:49.317 --> 06:50.483
(grunts)

07:01.329 --> 07:02.871
I really got to teach
this girl how to fold.

07:05.817 --> 07:09.076
I've been looking everywhere
for this sweater.

07:09.154 --> 07:11.930
Hartley must have brought it
without asking.

07:12.007 --> 07:14.766
I just love the way
it hugs my body.

07:17.663 --> 07:19.345
I missed you so much.

07:19.422 --> 07:20.605
I might never take you off.

07:27.856 --> 07:30.190
Well, if she's taking my son,

07:30.266 --> 07:31.950
I'm gonna take this lamp.

07:34.696 --> 07:35.278
(upbeat music playing)

07:38.850 --> 07:39.532
Ooh, is that a new teacher?

07:42.187 --> 07:42.627
I don't know.
All these old guys look alike.

07:44.614 --> 07:48.467
Watch me go secure his vote
for Student of the Month.

07:48.543 --> 07:51.194
Excuse me, sir.
(screams)

07:51.196 --> 07:52.954
Hello, children.

07:53.031 --> 07:55.381
What are you doing here?

07:55.458 --> 07:58.551
I'm the new substitute
science teacher.

07:58.628 --> 08:00.887
In what world are you qualified
to be a teacher?

08:00.964 --> 08:04.874
In a world with photocopiers
and easily altered credentials.

08:04.876 --> 08:07.819
Whatever. You're only here
because you don't think

08:07.896 --> 08:09.154
I can blackmail Hartley
on my own.

08:09.231 --> 08:11.381
Amy, that's insulting.

08:11.383 --> 08:13.399
I also wanted to get away
from your mother.

08:13.476 --> 08:15.977
Well, you're too late.

08:16.054 --> 08:16.828
I already planted
another kid's homework

08:16.905 --> 08:18.830
in Hartley's backpack.

08:18.907 --> 08:19.906
Once I get her on camera
with it, I'll be good to go.

08:19.983 --> 08:21.574
Oh, here she comes.

08:21.651 --> 08:23.743
This is gonna be good.

08:23.820 --> 08:25.504
Valerie, you lost your homework.

08:25.580 --> 08:27.413
Good thing I found you in time.

08:27.490 --> 08:29.566
Wouldn't want you
to get you an incomplete.

08:29.568 --> 08:32.660
But it looks like
you're getting one.

08:32.738 --> 08:36.681
Mr. Mayhem,
what are you doing here?

08:36.758 --> 08:38.091
Profiting off the stupidity
of our youth.

08:40.262 --> 08:41.745
He got hired as a sub.

08:41.747 --> 08:44.505
So a former supervillain

08:44.583 --> 08:47.359
is gonna mold
young innocent minds?

08:47.435 --> 08:49.844
(chuckles)
What could possibly go wrong?

08:49.921 --> 08:51.679
(alarm rings)

08:51.757 --> 08:53.681
See ya.

08:53.759 --> 08:56.442
Well,

08:56.519 --> 08:58.019
I guess you couldn't
pull it off after all.

08:58.096 --> 09:00.930
Why don't you let the mastermind
take it from here?

09:00.932 --> 09:02.599
(laughs) No way.

09:02.601 --> 09:04.768
I said I was gonna
finish the job

09:04.770 --> 09:05.602
and that's exactly
what I'm gonna do,

09:05.604 --> 09:06.619
so step aside.

09:06.696 --> 09:08.195
No, you step aside.

09:08.273 --> 09:09.363
Why don't we all step aside

09:09.441 --> 09:10.774
and not make a scene
in the hallway, huh?

09:10.776 --> 09:14.869
Student of the Month nominee
right here, remember?

09:14.946 --> 09:15.779
Who am I kidding?
You're not gonna listen to me.

09:15.781 --> 09:18.464
Keep fighting.

09:18.541 --> 09:20.374
If it's competition you want,
game on.

09:20.452 --> 09:21.968
Because I can definitely

09:22.045 --> 09:22.619
blackmail Hartley better
than you can.

09:22.621 --> 09:25.138
Really?

09:25.214 --> 09:26.565
Well, it looks like
you just dove headfirst

09:26.641 --> 09:28.400
into a father-daughter
blackmail showdown.

09:28.476 --> 09:30.476
-Bring it!
-Oh, I will!

09:30.553 --> 09:33.463
But first, I've got to go teach
a roomful of mouth breathers

09:33.465 --> 09:34.188
how to make a battery
out of a potato.

09:38.987 --> 09:40.612
(upbeat music playing)

09:44.067 --> 09:45.417
(laughs)

09:45.493 --> 09:47.586
So typical,

09:47.662 --> 09:48.661
using another one
of your crazy devices

09:48.738 --> 09:49.996
to get the job done.

09:50.073 --> 09:53.574
Oh, does that thing
take potato batteries?

09:53.652 --> 09:55.093
I'm scanning
Hartley's fingerprints

09:55.170 --> 09:57.095
to plant on the principal's car

09:57.172 --> 09:59.580
which I will then
be pushing off a cliff.

09:59.658 --> 10:00.173
Looks like you've lost this one,
little lady.

10:07.332 --> 10:10.108
(car alarms blaring)

10:10.185 --> 10:11.017
Touche!

10:20.770 --> 10:24.180
Hey, what are you doing?

10:24.182 --> 10:26.440
Keep going. I just met her.
It's an improvement.

10:26.518 --> 10:28.201
Go away!

10:28.277 --> 10:30.629
I'm about to plant the evidence
in Hartley's hand.

10:30.705 --> 10:31.788
Oh, don't let me stop you.
(laughs)

10:35.118 --> 10:36.968
On second thought,
maybe I will stop you

10:37.045 --> 10:38.628
by controlling your every move.
(laughs)

10:41.533 --> 10:42.298
Don't mind me
just grading your tests.

10:45.704 --> 10:49.222
Hey, Hartley,
can you hold my marker?

10:49.298 --> 10:50.890
Well, that's a strange question,
but okay.

10:57.399 --> 10:59.324
Amy, do you want me
to hold it or not?

10:59.401 --> 11:01.551
Yes, take it.

11:01.553 --> 11:03.236
Take the marker.

11:03.312 --> 11:05.813
I'm trying!

11:05.891 --> 11:06.489
Try harder!
Put a little leg into it!

11:09.561 --> 11:10.660
(shrieks)
What do you want from me?

11:13.415 --> 11:14.330
Ow!

11:17.569 --> 11:20.086
Amy, you're acting weird.

11:20.163 --> 11:22.088
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

11:22.165 --> 11:22.755
Yeah.

11:25.593 --> 11:26.676
That is the last time
I ask you to hold my marker.

11:31.507 --> 11:32.598
Mastermind!

11:35.253 --> 11:38.679
You gave me an F
on my science project?

11:38.757 --> 11:42.425
I created a solar panel
out of banana leaves

11:42.427 --> 11:44.761
that powered the entire school
for three days.

11:44.763 --> 11:46.538
How could you fail me?

11:46.614 --> 11:49.031
Same way I failed everyone else,
slowly and with great joy.

11:51.619 --> 11:52.936
But a failing grade
will prevent me

11:52.938 --> 11:53.937
from being Student of the Month.

11:53.939 --> 11:55.496
I know. Bonus!

11:57.867 --> 11:59.625
(sighs)

11:59.702 --> 12:01.110
Failing his own son.

12:01.112 --> 12:03.871
Oh, that's a new low.

12:03.949 --> 12:05.206
Perhaps you should get even

12:05.283 --> 12:08.393
by helping me frame Hartley
before he does.

12:08.470 --> 12:11.120
No, Amy. I told you
my villain days are over.

12:11.122 --> 12:11.804
I'm a better person now.

12:13.458 --> 12:15.792
Even though Dad's over there
showing your failing grade

12:15.794 --> 12:17.402
to the librarians?

12:17.479 --> 12:19.462
Keep it. I made copies.

12:19.464 --> 12:21.314
(laughs)

12:21.390 --> 12:21.814
I'll be a better person later.

12:23.635 --> 12:25.410
(upbeat music playing)

12:29.398 --> 12:31.232
Celia. How lovely to see you.

12:31.309 --> 12:31.916
Eh.

12:34.980 --> 12:36.254
Can I take your sweater?

12:36.331 --> 12:37.981
Nope. I run cold.

12:37.983 --> 12:40.425
Oh, well, we know that.

12:40.502 --> 12:41.751
Let's turn the heat up
a couple degrees.

12:43.655 --> 12:46.005
A couple hundred degrees.

12:46.082 --> 12:47.256
(electricity zaps)

12:49.344 --> 12:50.101
I'm gonna get you back.

12:51.921 --> 12:53.938
What did you say?

12:54.015 --> 12:57.442
I said,
I am gonna scratch your back.

12:59.838 --> 13:01.613
(chuckles)

13:01.689 --> 13:02.522
Well, don't stop now.

13:02.598 --> 13:03.231
Oh.

13:05.860 --> 13:06.676
How high did you turn
that thermostat?

13:06.678 --> 13:08.953
It's like an oven in here.

13:09.030 --> 13:10.029
Oh, well,
let me just take your sweater.

13:10.106 --> 13:12.273
No, no, no.

13:12.350 --> 13:13.533
That's the great thing
about alpaca,

13:13.609 --> 13:14.459
just soaks in the sweat.

13:16.612 --> 13:18.871
So what are we having for lunch?

13:18.948 --> 13:20.248
Lunch? Oh, right.

13:22.618 --> 13:24.469
We are having, oh...

13:26.531 --> 13:27.806
a pack of hot dogs...

13:27.882 --> 13:29.882
(giggles)

13:29.959 --> 13:30.975
left behind
by the previous tenants.

13:33.872 --> 13:35.296
Are you sure
I can't take your sweater?

13:35.373 --> 13:37.306
Don't touch the alpaca.

13:41.379 --> 13:43.396
Oh, what would you like
on your hotdogs?

13:43.472 --> 13:45.715
We have ketchup or...

13:45.717 --> 13:47.567
-Oh, perhaps a little mustard.
-(gasps)

13:49.145 --> 13:50.486
No!

13:52.481 --> 13:55.482
You ruined my sweater!

13:55.560 --> 13:57.226
No. No, no, no, no, no.
I just need to clean it.

13:57.228 --> 13:58.336
(chuckles) Hand it over.

14:01.157 --> 14:02.748
I will have it
looking new in no time.

14:02.825 --> 14:05.343
You better.

14:05.420 --> 14:06.845
I'm gonna wear it
to the steakhouse tonight.

14:06.921 --> 14:10.298
Got to protein load before
my arm wrestling tournament.

14:12.243 --> 14:15.687
Fun never ends with you,
does it, Celia?

14:15.763 --> 14:16.637
You just get this cleaned.

14:18.766 --> 14:19.599
And I'm taking my lunch to go.

14:25.440 --> 14:26.030
(grunts)

14:28.593 --> 14:30.851
How do you have mustard
all over your face?

14:30.929 --> 14:32.261
Because when you swatter
something on me

14:32.263 --> 14:34.188
while I'm in one form,

14:34.265 --> 14:36.374
it sticks with me
when I shape shift back.

14:36.451 --> 14:37.033
Oh, well, that's fun.

14:38.786 --> 14:40.912
(upbeat music playing)

14:42.531 --> 14:44.624
(sighs) Okay. We've got to find
a way to blackmail Hartley

14:44.700 --> 14:45.049
before Dad does.

14:46.869 --> 14:48.444
What are you doing?

14:48.446 --> 14:49.962
Writing her an apology note

14:50.039 --> 14:50.296
for whatever we're about to do.

14:52.467 --> 14:53.057
Just because we're blackmailing
her doesn't mean

14:53.134 --> 14:53.883
we can't be polite.

14:55.544 --> 14:58.062
See, this is why we tried
to leave you at that truck stop.

14:59.958 --> 15:02.183
Keep thinking. I'm gonna go
brainstorm on my own for a bit.

15:05.221 --> 15:07.313
(screams)

15:07.390 --> 15:08.406
What do you think you're doing?

15:08.483 --> 15:09.482
Since you crushed my dream

15:09.558 --> 15:12.076
of becoming student
of the month,

15:12.153 --> 15:13.636
I'm helping Amy beat you
at your blackmail game.

15:13.638 --> 15:14.987
You've turned
on your own father?

15:15.064 --> 15:16.748
Yup.
And since you betrayed your son,

15:16.824 --> 15:17.657
it's time for you
to pay the price.

15:17.733 --> 15:19.325
Jump ship. I'll give you an A.

15:19.402 --> 15:20.734
(indistinct) let's do this.

15:20.812 --> 15:22.912
(upbeat music playing)

15:24.832 --> 15:27.984
(sighs) Well, I finally got
all the mustard out of my eyes

15:27.986 --> 15:30.428
and a few other crevices
where mustard should never be.

15:32.415 --> 15:34.081
-(chuckles)
-(knock on door)

15:34.159 --> 15:35.007
EVA: Celia is here.

15:35.084 --> 15:37.101
How do you feel

15:37.178 --> 15:39.586
about taking a hit
for the family

15:39.664 --> 15:41.272
and riding on Celia's back
for the rest of your life?

15:43.835 --> 15:44.609
No.

15:46.020 --> 15:47.946
Okay.

15:48.022 --> 15:50.356
(sighs) Then at least shape
shift back into the sweater

15:50.433 --> 15:50.615
until I can stall her.

15:52.026 --> 15:52.784
Fine.

15:56.030 --> 15:57.847
Oh.

15:57.849 --> 15:59.365
COLBY: No. Don't you do it!

15:59.442 --> 16:00.116
Quiet, sweater!

16:01.703 --> 16:02.776
(knock on door)

16:02.854 --> 16:03.461
Come in.

16:06.874 --> 16:08.633
I brought your hotdogs back.

16:08.710 --> 16:09.458
At least the green ones.

16:11.029 --> 16:13.863
Almost done.

16:13.865 --> 16:16.307
The mustard stains
are tough to get out.

16:16.384 --> 16:18.034
-(Colby grunting)
-(grunting)

16:18.036 --> 16:18.476
COLBY: No!

16:20.538 --> 16:21.554
Hurry up. I need that sweater.

16:25.226 --> 16:25.817
(sighs)

16:27.378 --> 16:28.269
(grunts)

16:33.142 --> 16:36.995
I don't get it. How are you wet?

16:37.071 --> 16:37.820
Why don't you jump in the sink
and I'll explain it to you?

16:41.726 --> 16:44.985
(upbeat music playing)

16:45.063 --> 16:47.079
Jake, where have you been?

16:47.156 --> 16:48.731
-I have a plan.
-Oh, you save your breath.

16:48.733 --> 16:50.233
You thought you were so clever

16:50.235 --> 16:51.509
getting your brother
to help you.

16:51.586 --> 16:53.736
But I flipped him so now
he's helping me beat you.

16:53.738 --> 16:54.336
Ha!

16:56.074 --> 16:58.574
He used his super strength
to rip the head

16:58.576 --> 16:59.851
off the school's mascot statue

16:59.927 --> 17:01.427
and put it in Hartley's locker.

17:01.504 --> 17:03.855
That's right. We went big.

17:03.931 --> 17:04.513
-That's not that big.
-It's big enough.

17:07.009 --> 17:08.267
And once we get Hartley
on camera,

17:08.344 --> 17:09.935
she's gonna have
to keep our secret

17:10.012 --> 17:10.936
and you are gonna have
to bow down

17:11.013 --> 17:13.680
before your evil genius Daddy.

17:13.758 --> 17:15.149
Still trying to make
that one stick, huh?

17:17.262 --> 17:19.595
Guys, did you hear?

17:19.597 --> 17:22.281
Someone cut off the head
of the eagle mascot.

17:22.358 --> 17:23.374
And the police are here
to investigate.

17:23.451 --> 17:23.949
Listen up.

17:26.120 --> 17:27.879
Your vice principal
called me here

17:27.955 --> 17:30.289
because someone vandalized
school property.

17:30.366 --> 17:32.541
And when I find out who it was,
the culprit will be arrested.

17:36.281 --> 17:39.223
We were only supposed to frame
Hartley not get her arrested.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.117
Uh-hmm. And if she goes down,
they're gonna start asking her

17:41.119 --> 17:43.469
all sorts of questions,

17:43.546 --> 17:45.137
which means it's only
a matter of time

17:45.214 --> 17:46.472
until she says too much
and spills our secret.

17:49.218 --> 17:50.960
Don't look at me.
I wanted to move to Sheboygan.

17:50.962 --> 17:53.145
(upbeat music playing)

17:55.983 --> 17:58.317
(sighs) We to get that eagle
head out of Hartley's locker

17:58.394 --> 18:00.561
before that officer finds it.

18:00.638 --> 18:02.413
Look, as long as the officer

18:02.490 --> 18:04.064
doesn't go near her locker,
we're good.

18:04.142 --> 18:05.917
Heads up.
I'm searching your lockers.

18:05.993 --> 18:06.325
Well, that was bad timing.

18:08.404 --> 18:09.979
You can start with mine,
officer.

18:09.981 --> 18:10.588
I have nothing to hide.

18:10.665 --> 18:13.740
Uh, no. Wait.

18:13.818 --> 18:15.209
You can't go in there,
locker termites.

18:17.413 --> 18:18.045
They're real.
Ask the science teacher.

18:20.249 --> 18:20.548
I don't know
any of these people.

18:22.994 --> 18:25.919
Young man,
step away from that locker.

18:25.997 --> 18:28.681
Wait, officer,

18:28.757 --> 18:30.608
this is a violation
of our student rights.

18:30.685 --> 18:32.835
I mean to think
that you would insinuate

18:32.837 --> 18:35.187
that innocent Hartley here
would steal the...

18:35.264 --> 18:37.673
eagle head that is not in there,

18:37.675 --> 18:38.232
I think we are done.
Have a nice day.

18:40.528 --> 18:40.952
You're clear.

18:43.514 --> 18:45.623
What just happened?

18:45.700 --> 18:47.458
You tell me.
I thought you said you...

18:47.535 --> 18:49.460
Hid the eagle head
inside my locker?

18:49.537 --> 18:51.537
Wait.

18:51.614 --> 18:53.372
-No way.
-You knew?

18:53.449 --> 18:55.466
Of course I knew.

18:55.543 --> 18:57.468
It was pretty obvious.

18:57.545 --> 18:59.862
You becoming substitute teacher,

18:59.864 --> 19:01.922
Amy doing her weird
marker dance.

19:03.959 --> 19:06.385
I gave you the chance
to come clean

19:06.462 --> 19:09.313
and you still wanted
to blackmail me.

19:09.390 --> 19:11.056
So I figured
I had to teach you a lesson.

19:11.133 --> 19:15.153
I moved the eagle head
out of my locker hours ago.

19:15.229 --> 19:17.155
Whoa. I can't believe
you played us like that.

19:17.231 --> 19:19.382
You gave me no choice.

19:19.384 --> 19:22.994
I just don't understand
why you wanted to blackmail me.

19:23.070 --> 19:24.328
I'm a good person.

19:24.405 --> 19:26.780
And when I say you can trust me,
I mean it.

19:28.559 --> 19:31.394
I trusted you.
I'm actually the victim here.

19:31.396 --> 19:33.913
They lured me in,

19:33.989 --> 19:36.507
which means
I'm still a good person, right?

19:36.584 --> 19:40.753
You vandalized school property
just to be Student of the Month.

19:40.829 --> 19:42.338
So is that a yes?

19:44.909 --> 19:46.667
More of a, "You better fix
that statute quick."

19:46.744 --> 19:48.502
And from here on out,

19:48.579 --> 19:50.021
you're all gonna start
trusting me.

19:50.097 --> 19:51.689
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:51.766 --> 19:53.082
Hold on there, missy.

19:53.084 --> 19:57.010
You can't just waltz in here
and twist my arm.

19:57.088 --> 19:59.012
Well, I do know your secret

19:59.090 --> 20:02.650
and I'm pretty sure you don't
want me to tell anyone, so...

20:04.445 --> 20:06.704
Welcome to the family.

20:06.781 --> 20:10.933
(upbeat music playing)

20:10.935 --> 20:12.935
Oh, don't even get me started
about Octogal.

20:12.937 --> 20:14.545
She once tentacled me so hard

20:14.622 --> 20:15.120
I couldn't sit down
for eight days.

20:17.032 --> 20:18.958
I'm sorry. What was this?

20:19.034 --> 20:20.885
Oh, we're just hanging
with our new bestie, Hartley.

20:20.962 --> 20:22.002
Do whatever the girl says.

20:25.616 --> 20:28.726
Hey, isn't that Celia's sweater?

20:28.803 --> 20:31.062
The one we've been
looking for everywhere?

20:31.138 --> 20:33.973
Oh, it certainly is.

20:34.049 --> 20:37.460
I only borrowed it
for a few days. But then...

20:37.462 --> 20:39.895
Wait, why do you care
about my grandma's sweater?

20:42.300 --> 20:43.908
This isn't about us.
This is about you.

20:45.470 --> 20:48.137
I was gonna put it back
but there was a loose thread

20:48.139 --> 20:50.397
so I pulled it.

20:50.475 --> 20:52.566
And once I started pulling it,
I couldn't stop.

20:52.643 --> 20:52.825
Then this happened.

20:54.495 --> 20:57.830
And there's my blackmail.

20:57.906 --> 21:00.240
Ha!

21:00.318 --> 21:00.916
You're not gonna beat
an evil genius.

21:02.745 --> 21:04.670
Hello, police department.

21:04.747 --> 21:05.754
Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

21:09.494 --> 21:10.584
You know, for a girl
who doesn't like blackmail,

21:10.661 --> 21:13.104
-she's really good at it.
-Yeah.

21:13.180 --> 21:14.997
This is a Hartley
I can rock with.

21:14.999 --> 21:16.607
Okay. I think we're done
with the blackmailing.

21:18.336 --> 21:19.277
So, Hartley,

21:21.506 --> 21:24.598
if you promise
to keep our secret,

21:24.675 --> 21:26.784
I think we can help you out
with the sweater.

21:28.696 --> 21:31.289
It's so clean.

21:31.365 --> 21:32.790
I'm gonna start having you
wash all my clothes.

21:34.519 --> 21:36.794
Oh. Oh.

21:36.871 --> 21:39.446
There seems to be a bit
of fuzz there.

21:39.524 --> 21:41.206
That's not fuzz.
It's just a loose thread.

21:43.361 --> 21:44.451
(gasps)

21:44.529 --> 21:47.713
Oh, no.

21:47.790 --> 21:50.866
How am I supposed to fix this?

21:50.868 --> 21:52.593
(sighs) Come on.
I got thread in the kitchen.

21:55.964 --> 21:57.222
Yes, she took the bait.

21:57.299 --> 21:59.984
You know, I'm really starting
to see the upside

22:00.061 --> 22:00.267
of having a brother
who shape shifts.

22:03.047 --> 22:04.137
COLBY: Ow!

22:04.215 --> 22:05.272
Quiet, sweater.

22:07.643 --> 22:07.825
Quick, give me the sweater
that you ripped.

22:12.390 --> 22:14.448
There, now you're off the hook.
Celia will think she ruined it.

22:16.410 --> 22:18.502
I can't believe
I'm deceiving my grandma.

22:18.579 --> 22:20.563
I have never done that. Ever.

22:20.565 --> 22:22.898
Would you rather see
what happens

22:22.900 --> 22:23.674
when she finds out
you ruined her sweater?

22:23.751 --> 22:25.568
Uh, no.

22:25.570 --> 22:26.794
Yay! You're learning.

22:30.575 --> 22:31.924
I am so done being a sweater.

22:33.669 --> 22:34.259
What?

22:36.597 --> 22:37.930
(chuckles)

22:39.750 --> 22:40.140
(both chuckle)

22:42.269 --> 22:43.811
(screams)

22:47.758 --> 22:48.273
-(knock on door)
-HARTLEY: Come in.

22:50.928 --> 22:52.036
Holy pigsty!

22:53.280 --> 22:55.764
Is your room always this messy?

22:55.766 --> 22:56.490
Messy? I just cleaned it.

22:58.786 --> 23:02.287
You know, I gotta say,
you kind of impressed me today.

23:02.364 --> 23:03.697
I impressed myself.

23:03.774 --> 23:05.049
I mean, who would have thought

23:05.126 --> 23:09.220
I could outsmart a family
of supervillains? (chuckles)

23:09.296 --> 23:12.131
Yeah, you got us pretty good.
(chuckles)

23:12.207 --> 23:15.876
You do realize that family
of supervillains is at home

23:15.953 --> 23:17.803
right now trying to plot
their revenge, right?

23:17.880 --> 23:19.138
Oh, I think
they learned their lesson.

23:21.216 --> 23:21.640
Didn't they?

23:23.794 --> 23:25.218
Sure they did. (chuckles)

23:25.296 --> 23:25.853
Good.

23:27.648 --> 23:30.074
Amy, you're not gonna

23:30.151 --> 23:33.152
try and get even with me,
are you?

23:33.228 --> 23:33.861
No.

23:37.308 --> 23:39.083
(scoffs) I gotta go.
I'll see you in your sleep.

23:41.145 --> 23:41.743
I mean, I'll see you at school.

23:44.315 --> 23:45.481
Amy?

23:45.483 --> 24:19.531
Amy!
