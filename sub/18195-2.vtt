00:05.440 --> 00:08.034
No, you don't understand.

00:08.119 --> 00:10.554
I want results, not excuses. OK?

00:10.640 --> 00:14.599
Quarterly figures on my desk
by the time I reach the office.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.074

00:34.440 --> 00:36.396
Thank you, driver.

00:42.160 --> 00:45.914
Cancel the 12:30. Put the 4:30 up to 3:00.
- And the 3:15?

00:46.000 --> 00:49.117
Make it 6:00.
- At 6:10 you're on Radio 4.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.350
6:20, then. Missed a bit, sonny.

00:51.440 --> 00:53.396
Sorry, madam.

00:57.440 --> 00:59.317
Right. What about New York?

00:59.400 --> 01:02.039
You and Robert
are booked on first class at 7:00.

01:02.120 --> 01:04.190
Good work, Rachel. Thank you.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.396
Oh, no, Ms Gifford. Thank you.

01:06.520 --> 01:09.080
I can't tell you
how much I appreciate the opportunity.

01:30.080 --> 01:31.957
Your ex-husband's on line three.

01:32.040 --> 01:35.316
Oh, God. Again? Take a message.

01:35.400 --> 01:38.073
There's a caller on line two
who wants to order stationery.

01:38.160 --> 01:40.116
Stationery?!

01:41.160 --> 01:44.630
Since when
do I take orders for stationery?

01:45.880 --> 01:51.000
200 manila envelopes, 400 paperclips,
five boxes of correction fluid...

01:51.080 --> 01:54.470
Thank you for choosing Ferguson Office
Supplies. Enjoy your stationery.

02:07.440 --> 02:10.352
Yeah? - I'd llke to order some
Chinese food, please.

02:10.440 --> 02:15.468
A number 6, two number 32s, and one
of your delicious soya-based desserts.

02:15.560 --> 02:16.675
Adam, what do you want?

02:16.760 --> 02:19.320
Oh, you know, just a chat.
See how you're feeling.

02:19.400 --> 02:22.710
Well, I'm feeling like shite.
So, can I go now, please?

02:22.800 --> 02:24.518
Hang on, hang on. What's happened?

02:24.600 --> 02:26.113
Look, I've moved out, right.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.919
You moved...
So, where are you going to sleep tonight?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.956
Oh, let me see.

02:31.040 --> 02:34.237
The bottom of the Manchester Ship Canal.
How's that?

02:40.080 --> 02:41.229
Hello?

02:41.320 --> 02:46.678
Are you fully aware just how bloomingly,
radiantly gorgeous you are?

02:46.760 --> 02:48.910
You're being affectionate. What's wrong?

02:49.000 --> 02:51.070
I can't help it. It's the effect
you have on me.

02:51.160 --> 02:54.152
So, um...was there anything else?

02:54.240 --> 02:56.151
No, no. Just that.

02:56.240 --> 02:58.595
Oh, yeah... Um, I need to ask a wee favour.

02:58.680 --> 03:01.035
The answer's no.
- You don't know what it is yet.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.873
''Can Pete come to stay?''
Adam, the answer is no.

03:03.960 --> 03:05.712
I'm still cleaning up after last time.

03:05.800 --> 03:07.870
Oh, come on, Rach. For me, yeah?

03:07.960 --> 03:11.236
No! Absolutely not. I'm so sorry. Goodbye.

03:12.480 --> 03:13.674
That went very well.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.549
<i>Heather?</i>

03:20.640 --> 03:23.359
Felix! What a pleasant surprise.

03:23.440 --> 03:27.752
I'm stuck in this terminally dull meeting
with your son-in-law,

03:27.840 --> 03:30.752
and I was suddenly overcome
with a strong desire to call you.

03:30.840 --> 03:35.118
Felix, could you hold on just a moment?
I think we've got mice on the line.

03:39.440 --> 03:41.749
250 different ringing tones.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.360
Bach... Scarlatti...

03:46.480 --> 03:48.436
Paganini, I think. Yeah.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.159
1000-number memory, text messaging...

03:51.240 --> 03:53.629
Internet access?

03:53.720 --> 03:56.553
Not as such, no.
But this plastic cover thing is swappable.

03:56.640 --> 03:59.518
On the next generation of mobiles
Internet will be as standard.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.637
David, this isn't a phone.
It's a brick with numbers on it.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.676
Check this out.

04:04.760 --> 04:07.149
Oh, now, that is beautiful.

04:07.240 --> 04:10.710
Fax, word processor, Internet access.
Don't touch that button.

04:10.800 --> 04:11.949
Why? What is it?

04:12.040 --> 04:13.996
Cigarette lighter.
- Really?

04:15.760 --> 04:20.629
That reminds me. Excuse me, I've just
got to make an urgent...business call.

04:20.720 --> 04:21.914
I won't be a minute.

04:25.360 --> 04:27.351
<i>Settling in all right, Janet?</i>

04:27.440 --> 04:28.509
Jenny.

04:28.600 --> 04:32.354
Jenny?
My girlfriend's got an aunt called Jenny.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.429
Small world.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.476
Except she's dead now.

04:36.680 --> 04:38.033
Her aunt, I mean.

04:38.120 --> 04:40.315
I know how she feels, Barry.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.789
If you need a hand, just give us a shout.

04:42.880 --> 04:46.555
We're all just one big happy family here.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.596
Er, you might want to get that.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.790
Ferguson Office Supplies.
How can I help you?

04:53.880 --> 04:55.313
Hiya. It's me.

04:55.400 --> 04:56.469
Oh, hello.

04:56.560 --> 04:58.994
Bad time?
- It's always a bad time here.

04:59.080 --> 05:01.514
They're very strict on personal phone calls.

05:01.600 --> 05:05.229
If they catch you they beat you
to death with rolls of fax paper.

05:05.320 --> 05:06.992
I just wanted to hear your voice.

05:07.080 --> 05:08.354
Look, I'm at work.

05:08.440 --> 05:10.396
If I order something will you keep talking?

05:10.480 --> 05:12.072
All right. Um...

05:13.120 --> 05:17.432
Well, we've got...
some self-laminating pouches.

05:18.680 --> 05:22.753
Some lateral suspension files.
They're very nice.

05:22.840 --> 05:28.073
And there's lots and lots
of long, thick, leaded pencils.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.434
Listen, I've got to go. The boss is lurking.

05:33.520 --> 05:34.589
Can I see you tonight?

05:34.680 --> 05:38.434
Er... No. No, I don't think so.
- Tomorrow, then?

05:38.520 --> 05:40.909
Look, it's a bit quick.
- Jenny?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.230
Thanks for calling Ferguson Office Supplies.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.476
So, tell me, exactly how late are you?

05:56.560 --> 05:59.199
I'm not late. I'm not due back till two.
- I don't mean work.

05:59.280 --> 06:02.556
I mean your...what-d'you-call-it.

06:02.640 --> 06:04.039
Is that a medical term, is it?

06:04.120 --> 06:07.749
You know what I'm talking about.
- Go on. Go on. Use the proper word.

06:07.840 --> 06:10.513
All right, then. The curse.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.155
I'm two weeks late.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.390
Is that a lot?
- Can we stop talking about this?

06:15.480 --> 06:16.833
Yeah. Sure.

06:17.880 --> 06:20.189
You ate that very quickly.
- So?

06:20.280 --> 06:23.397
If you're eating for two,
perhaps we should split the bill three ways?

06:23.480 --> 06:26.074
Adam, I might not be pregnant.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.116
But you must be.
- Why?

06:28.200 --> 06:31.342
Well, surely women just...know.
- How?

06:31.377 --> 06:35.836
I don't know. It's sort of...mystical, isn't it?
Something to do with the moon and the tides.

06:37.840 --> 06:39.319
Are your breasts getting bigger?

06:39.400 --> 06:41.755
I don't know. Do they look bigger?

06:42.960 --> 06:45.190
Well, they're very nice, but...

06:45.280 --> 06:47.236
it's hard to tell from here.

06:47.400 --> 06:49.118
Adam, calm down.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.031
I can't calm down. I'm excited.

06:51.120 --> 06:54.476
I can't sit still or sleep for thinking
about it.

06:54.560 --> 06:58.235
I think we should sort this out once and
for all. We should get a pregnancy test.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.834
Absolutely. You wait here.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.514
Where are you going?
- There's a chemist across the road.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.511
Adam, I'm not doing it here.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.750
Well, obviously not here.

07:07.840 --> 07:09.512
There's a loo out the back.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.353
I have to be back at the office in a minute.
We'll do it tonight.

07:12.440 --> 07:14.317
Tonight? It's a date.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.676
I might be a bit late, though.
Pete's asked me to interrogate Jen.

07:17.760 --> 07:20.957
We'll meet back at home
and make a real night of it, OK?

07:21.040 --> 07:22.598
All right.

07:22.680 --> 07:24.955
So, Pete sent you, then?

07:25.040 --> 07:28.828
Sent me?
- Yeah. To check up on the Scarlet Lady.

07:29.880 --> 07:32.348
No, I just thought it would be
nice to have a...

07:32.440 --> 07:33.589
Yes.

07:33.680 --> 07:37.468
It's nothing serious, OK?
I'm just having a laugh.

07:37.560 --> 07:38.709
A laugh?

07:38.800 --> 07:41.872
Remember? We used to do it all the time
way back in the late '80s.

07:41.960 --> 07:45.350
What about Pete?
Technically you are still married.

07:45.440 --> 07:47.670
I don't believe I'm hearing this.

07:47.760 --> 07:48.556
What?

07:48.640 --> 07:52.110
A lecture on family values
from the Marquis de bloody Sade!

07:52.200 --> 07:54.794
When you split with Rachel
you went at it hammer and tongs.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.871
Ah, yes, but you know, that wasn't fun.

07:56.960 --> 08:02.159
No, that was me hiding my pain
behind a brash, womanising exterior.

08:03.320 --> 08:05.276
Actually, it was fun.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.355
It's just...

08:07.440 --> 08:10.910
Oh, God, it's so nice just to be
desired again,

08:11.000 --> 08:13.036
if you know what I mean.

08:13.120 --> 08:18.194
Anyway, we can't all float around on a white,
fluffy cloud of romantic bliss like you and Rach.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.475
It's not always romantic bliss, you know.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.516
Trouble in paradise?

08:22.600 --> 08:25.273
What's she done?
Shampooed without conditioner?

08:25.360 --> 08:28.318
There's loads of stuff between me
and Rachel you don't know about.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.356
Oh, right. Yeah. The dark side.

08:30.440 --> 08:32.270
No, not dark, just...

08:33.320 --> 08:34.469
..complicated.

08:34.559 --> 08:36.515
Right, yeah. It must be. Look at you.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.876
Really complicated.
Flowers, champagne for the woman you love.

08:39.960 --> 08:43.475
Healthy joint income,
no kids, nice house, no responsibilities.

08:43.559 --> 08:45.516
Am I starting to sound bitter?
- A little.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.239
Yeah. Cos I am.

08:48.320 --> 08:51.312
Listen, just tell Pete I'm so sorry.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.198
I didn't mean to upset him.
I was just letting off a bit of steam.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.111
I was having a laugh.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.156
I was, and...

08:58.240 --> 09:02.472
Oh, God, if it's any consolation, I don't think
this Robert's that bothered about me anyway.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.916
Who the hell...!

09:08.440 --> 09:11.352
Well, I don't think they're from Pete.

09:15.360 --> 09:17.316
Hello, Sleeping Beauty.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.356
Oh, my God.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.960
David, they're beautiful.
- Aren't they?

09:23.040 --> 09:25.076
Where's your mother?

09:25.160 --> 09:27.833
In the kitchen. Why?

09:32.240 --> 09:34.196
Karen, the twins are crying.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.238
Did Felix talk about me?

09:41.320 --> 09:43.072
And nothing else.

09:43.160 --> 09:45.913
He's picking you up tomorrow night. 7:30.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.798
Could I have a word, please?

09:48.880 --> 09:50.791
In private.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.038
Stop it.
- Stop what?

09:57.120 --> 10:00.032
You know what.
Pimping for your slimy business friends.

10:00.120 --> 10:02.076
It's not pimping. It's matchmaking.

10:02.160 --> 10:06.915
But in case you hadn't noticed, David, she's
married. To my father, as a matter of fact.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.037
Well, I won't tell him if you don't.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.433
You really are a moral black hole,
aren't you?

10:16.560 --> 10:19.233
If that's Felix Bishop, tell him
she's grounded.

10:21.360 --> 10:25.114
Sorry to disturb you. I just wondered if
you'd heard the terrible news?

10:25.200 --> 10:27.475
Sorry, not interested.

10:27.560 --> 10:28.595
Who was it?

10:28.680 --> 10:31.148
Jehovah's Witness.
Flogging their Bad News Bible.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.072
Look we're all C of E here.
- I really think you should read this.

10:52.840 --> 10:53.989
Hiya.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.672
Hi.

10:55.760 --> 10:57.591
Flowers, champagne and...

10:58.640 --> 11:01.279
Da-da! One pregnancy test.

11:01.360 --> 11:05.239
Tell you what, though - good job this doesn't
happen very often. These are ten quid a pop.

11:05.320 --> 11:07.276
Ten quid for a stick you pee on.

11:08.320 --> 11:09.799
Shame you can't make your own.

11:09.880 --> 11:12.235
Adam, I'm not pregnant.
- We'll soon find out.

11:12.320 --> 11:15.312
No, I mean I know I'm not pregnant.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.836
Are you sure?
- Absolutely. It happened just now.

11:20.360 --> 11:22.476
False alarm.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.471
OK.

11:24.560 --> 11:25.913
I see.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.835
Let's just have some champagne, then,
shall we?

11:33.920 --> 11:35.876
I'm sorry.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.190
I shouldn't have got your hopes up.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.713
Ah, don't be daft.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.870
Are you disappointed?

11:41.960 --> 11:44.428
Disappointed? No. Well, a little.

11:44.520 --> 11:45.748
Um...

11:47.680 --> 11:50.319
We're just celebrating something else now,
aren't we?

11:53.720 --> 11:55.073
To a near miss.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.636
To a near miss.

12:01.840 --> 12:04.991
''The Council have decided
to sell off Brookwood Park and playground,

12:05.080 --> 12:08.595
and turn it into a large-scale retail
development and car park.''

12:08.720 --> 12:11.439
Bang go the property prices.

12:11.520 --> 12:14.239
Is that all you can think of?
Property prices?

12:14.320 --> 12:16.276
That's what it's about, isn't it?

12:16.360 --> 12:20.433
I mean, it's hardly Tuscany. Just a couple
of dodgy swings and a scrap of green.

12:20.520 --> 12:23.592
Where your son goes to play.
Josh loves those swings.

12:23.680 --> 12:27.275
There's a perfectly good swing in the shed.
- That's not the point, though.

12:27.360 --> 12:31.512
It's not about whether Josh
has access to a swing, or property prices.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.955
It's about the community,
other people's children

12:34.040 --> 12:36.634
who don't have
three-quarters of an acre to run around in.

12:37.760 --> 12:39.591
The erosion of our quality of life.

12:39.680 --> 12:43.070
If there was something I could do,
I would, honestly.

12:43.160 --> 12:46.470
So, go to the meeting.
Tomorrow night. 6:30 pm.

12:46.560 --> 12:49.518
Don't just come over all nimbyish,
and then refuse to do anything.

12:49.600 --> 12:54.071
Community meeting? I hate the idea of
it all - weak tea and economy biscuits.

12:54.160 --> 12:56.116
You are so apathetic.
- I'm not.

12:56.200 --> 12:59.556
Yes, you are. When have you ever
made a stand on anything?

12:59.640 --> 13:02.279
Marched, protested, made your voice heard?

13:02.360 --> 13:04.112
Apartheid.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.270
You stopped drinking South African wine.

13:06.360 --> 13:09.477
I very much doubt Nelson Mandela
will be sending you a thank-you note.

13:09.560 --> 13:11.676
Well, why don't you go?

13:11.760 --> 13:14.069
OK. Great. I'd love to.

13:14.160 --> 13:17.357
You can bath the children,
and talk to my mother about her boyfriend.

13:17.440 --> 13:19.396
All right, all right. I'll go.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.948
I can tell you this,
it'll be a complete waste of time.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.556
Oh, shite. Shite.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.868
Oh, yeah?

13:28.960 --> 13:31.679
Hey! Hello, mate. Sorry, did I wake you?

13:31.760 --> 13:35.548
Would I be right in thinking you're pissed?
- You sound like Jenny when you say that.

13:35.640 --> 13:38.757
Except... Except the accent's wrong.

13:38.840 --> 13:43.277
You gotta hold your hands out like that,
and go, ''What time of night do you call this?''

13:43.360 --> 13:45.794
Where've you been, Pete?
- Not bad.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.472
But the accent's still wrong.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.551
It needs to be more nasal. More flatter.

13:49.640 --> 13:50.868
Seriously, though.

13:50.960 --> 13:55.875
Seriously though... I've been out doing
what you told me to do. Out looking for flats.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.154
Where?

13:57.240 --> 13:58.229
Let me see...

13:58.320 --> 14:01.756
The Ship And Anchor,
the Prince John, and the Carpenter's Arms.

14:01.840 --> 14:05.037
And do you know what?
Not one of them had flats.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.873
But do you know what they did have? Lager!

14:07.960 --> 14:10.394
You've been to the pub by yourself.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.436
No, no, no, no.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.636
I've been out with Jenny.

14:14.720 --> 14:18.349
Er... No, I forgot.

14:18.440 --> 14:21.876
I've split up with Jenny. Yes,
I was by myself.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.110
Don't go drinking on your own, Pete.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.475
Why don't you come and join me?

14:26.560 --> 14:30.439
Are you wise? I am going back to Rachel.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.596
You know, I really love you.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.312
I love you too, mate.

14:45.360 --> 14:48.272
No, I mean it. I bloody do love you.

14:48.360 --> 14:52.956
I think it's an absolute bloody tragedy
what happened with you and Jen.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.554
I've got to tell you something.
Something rotten.

14:55.640 --> 14:58.791
Something that happened earlier tonight.
- Go on.

14:58.880 --> 15:02.509
You mustn't tell Rachel I told you.
- Jenny made a pass at you.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.909
No, Rachel and me... What?

15:05.000 --> 15:07.468
Jenny tried to get off with you again.

15:07.560 --> 15:09.152
No. What did you say that for?

15:09.240 --> 15:11.470
She fancies you. She's always fancied you.

15:11.560 --> 15:12.959
And now that I'm off the scene...

15:13.040 --> 15:15.110
Hold on to your horses, you big bollocks!

15:15.200 --> 15:19.159
''Oh, Adam. Lovely Adam.
Twinkly, Irish, funny Adam.

15:19.240 --> 15:22.949
Is Adam going to be there?
Are we going to invite Adam?''

15:23.040 --> 15:27.079
Hey, Adam,
do you think Rachel secretly fancies me?

15:28.840 --> 15:30.796
You wanker!

15:33.360 --> 15:37.512
If you want to borrow money to go to
a hotel, I will lend it to you.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.831
But you make sure you're gone out of here
by tomorrow night.

16:02.120 --> 16:05.635
Good morning.
- Give us a kiss.

16:05.720 --> 16:08.598
Oh, no way! Not till you've brushed
your teeth.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.432
Worth a try.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.715
Adam?
- Yeah?

16:12.800 --> 16:15.030
Are you still all right about yesterday?

16:17.280 --> 16:19.236
About the near miss?

16:20.520 --> 16:22.476
Yeah. Of course. Of course.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.196
We're lucky, aren't we?

16:27.280 --> 16:28.918
Yeah.

16:29.320 --> 16:30.548
Yeah.

17:03.560 --> 17:04.959
So, what do you reckon, eh?

17:05.040 --> 17:07.759
It is fantastic!
- Hey, it's all right, in't it?

17:07.839 --> 17:11.435
Yeah, and the carpet doesn't make
that sucking noise when you walk on it.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.112
Mind you, I'm going to miss that.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.714
It's gonna need a lick of paint.
A couple of coats of magnolia should sort it.

17:16.800 --> 17:20.634
Yeah. Some new furniture.
Can we burn the futon?

17:21.520 --> 17:23.476
Has it got a spare bedroom, love?

17:23.560 --> 17:25.516
What do we want a spare room for?

17:25.599 --> 17:28.512
Well, you know,
just...after we get married an' that,

17:28.600 --> 17:31.353
if there's ever more than just
the two of us.

17:31.440 --> 17:36.036
How do you mean? Like a lodger? Like Adam?
- No.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.439
I know what you're on about.

17:37.520 --> 17:40.318
Don't panic. I think we'd better get a bed
before we have a baby.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.472
Hey, shall we go and see the rest of it?
- Yeah.

17:51.920 --> 17:55.196
Of course, it'll need some work doing.
You know, painting and...

17:57.520 --> 17:59.476
Are you on your own?

18:03.200 --> 18:04.155
Sorry?

18:04.240 --> 18:06.037
Is it just you?

18:06.120 --> 18:07.951
Yeah. It's just me.

18:11.080 --> 18:12.035
Angry?

18:12.120 --> 18:12.870
Yeah.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.439
Can I come in?
- No.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.795
So, giving you these isn't going to
help much.

18:17.840 --> 18:21.230
Flowers.
- To apologise...for the flowers.

18:21.320 --> 18:24.118
Robert, I just think it's inappropriate.

18:25.320 --> 18:27.834
I know I've been a bit full-on,

18:27.920 --> 18:31.230
and I should be a bastard, and not phone
you, pretend I'm not interested,

18:31.320 --> 18:33.880
and all that crap men are supposed
to do, but...

18:35.720 --> 18:37.676
..the fact is I am interested.

18:38.720 --> 18:40.950
So...why pretend I'm not?

18:41.040 --> 18:45.830
Am I making sense? I mean, shall I go on,
or are the police on their way already?

18:45.920 --> 18:48.593
Go on.
- You know, you should count yourself lucky.

18:48.680 --> 18:51.478
Compared to some sods out there,
I'm a good catch.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.790
I'm reliable, I'm affectionate.

18:53.880 --> 18:56.553
I am, I'm told, more than averagely
good in bed.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.596
Passionate and courteous.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.830
Imaginative...

19:00.920 --> 19:03.229
but not weird or kinky.

19:03.320 --> 19:06.869
I'm clean, which I know doesn't sound much,
but shouldn't be taken for granted.

19:06.960 --> 19:11.397
If I'm a bit over-enthusiastic, I'm sorry.
I won't phone you again.

19:11.480 --> 19:13.675
I'll... I'll wait for you to call me,

19:13.760 --> 19:16.354
and if I don't hear from you...

19:17.400 --> 19:18.469
..that's a shame.

19:18.560 --> 19:22.872
Because whatever happens, Jenny,
whether you phone me or not,

19:22.960 --> 19:25.838
I think you're absolutely spectacular.

19:29.680 --> 19:31.193
See you.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.429
Hello?

19:44.520 --> 19:46.476
<i>Hiya.</i>

19:46.560 --> 19:48.516
Hello. How are you?

19:51.040 --> 19:54.396
Good. Listen, I was just thinking.

19:55.440 --> 19:56.998
Do you want to go out tonight?

19:57.080 --> 19:59.913
Yeah. Er... 8:00?

20:00.000 --> 20:01.319
30.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.277
8:30 it is.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.669
Conditions as follows.
- Go on.

20:05.760 --> 20:07.990
I choose the restaurant. I pay for dinner.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.638
No more flowers.

20:09.720 --> 20:11.472
Agreed.

20:11.560 --> 20:13.118
I'll see you then.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.198
What year were you born?

20:16.280 --> 20:17.554
1967.

20:17.640 --> 20:19.471
You're a mature student?
- No.

20:19.560 --> 20:20.549
You're not a student?

20:20.640 --> 20:22.312
No. I'm not mature. Ha-ha!

20:22.400 --> 20:25.312
No, but I was a student.

20:25.400 --> 20:26.879
When?
- 12 years ago.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.075
What did you study?

20:28.160 --> 20:30.355
Accountancy.

20:30.440 --> 20:33.671
I know what you're thinking -
''Accountancy, boring!''

20:33.760 --> 20:37.548
But no, no, they were pretty wild times.
Oh, yeah, I can assure you of that.

20:37.640 --> 20:39.835
There was one time we got completely wasted.

20:39.920 --> 20:42.480
We'd been in the pub all day,
and went to my mate's house,

20:42.560 --> 20:45.154
and he had some weed,
so we rolled this great big spliff.

20:45.240 --> 20:48.835
I had a puff on it, next thing you know
- bang! I passed out in the kitchen.

20:48.920 --> 20:51.593
Smacked my head on the formica top.
Blood everywhere!

20:51.680 --> 20:56.629
Had to be hospitalised. Even had a brain
scan. Nearly lost the sight in one eye.

20:56.720 --> 20:59.154
Ooh, students, eh? Ho ho!

21:01.240 --> 21:04.277
So, where do you stand
on Third World debt?

21:04.360 --> 21:07.955
Basically my feeling is, if you borrow
money, you've got to pay it back.

21:08.040 --> 21:11.749
Right. Well, Peter, we'll let you know.

21:11.840 --> 21:16.470
<i>Now over to the Chairman
of your Residents' Association, Mr Phillips.</i>

21:19.840 --> 21:23.355
So, if I may refer you
to item one on the agenda,

21:23.440 --> 21:26.796
concerning the official naming
of our little band.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.154
Anyone any ideas?

21:28.240 --> 21:31.312
Are we allowed to smoke?
- I'll put it to the floor.

21:32.720 --> 21:34.676
What's our smoking policy?

21:34.760 --> 21:36.716
And this would be your room.

21:36.800 --> 21:40.110
Your own bathroom up there,
so no queuing for the loo.

21:40.200 --> 21:41.155
Oh, great.

21:41.240 --> 21:44.152
<i>I've got a fold-out bed somewhere
for when your son comes to stay.</i>

21:44.240 --> 21:45.639
Oh, that's nice.

21:45.720 --> 21:47.676
So, what do you think?

21:49.920 --> 21:51.592
I think it's smashing.

21:51.680 --> 21:54.513
Yeah, my wife used to use it as her study.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.397
Oh, you're divorced?

21:56.480 --> 21:57.629
Amicably.

21:57.720 --> 21:59.950
Blimey!
How did you manage to pull that one off?

22:00.040 --> 22:02.270
It took a while.

22:02.360 --> 22:06.512
How about you? Divorced? - No.
Separated. But only for a trial period.

22:09.760 --> 22:12.911
And afterwards, you get a mint imperial
and a carnation for the lady.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.991
You don't get that in your
fancy restaurants.

22:15.080 --> 22:17.036
You certainly don't.

22:17.160 --> 22:19.720
How was your korma?

22:22.280 --> 22:24.999
You big girl! That is a lass's curry!

22:25.080 --> 22:28.675
I'm telling you, if Pete knew
I was out with someone who had a korma...

22:28.760 --> 22:31.911
Oh, that was the P word. Sorry.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.831
<i>Er, I'll change the subject.</i>

22:34.880 --> 22:37.440
What is it you do...again?

22:37.520 --> 22:41.433
We develop communications systems
that utilise Internet technology,

22:41.520 --> 22:47.993
but via the telephone interface as opposed
to the outmoded QWERTY keyboard.

22:48.080 --> 22:50.355
No. Sorry. Different language.

22:50.440 --> 22:54.035
You've got to understand,
I haven't come to terms with Ceefax yet.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.035
What?

23:01.120 --> 23:03.190
Nothing.

23:03.280 --> 23:06.716
Good. Right.
Do you want to go back up for some more?

23:06.800 --> 23:10.475
Er, no. I'm fine.

23:10.560 --> 23:13.836
Do you think I'm taking
''eat as much as you like'' a bit literally?

23:13.920 --> 23:15.592
Well, stuff it! It's my fiver.

23:15.680 --> 23:18.319
I'm going to make the most of it.

23:18.400 --> 23:24.123
Green spaces in our cities
are absolutely vital...

23:24.800 --> 23:27.155
You wanted to say somethlng, sir?

23:27.240 --> 23:29.549
Who me? No, sorry, no, I'm just leaving.

23:29.640 --> 23:32.757
Well, thank you for your contribution.

23:32.840 --> 23:35.149
I would like to make one point, if I may?

23:35.240 --> 23:36.559
Yes?

23:36.640 --> 23:39.234
You're on item one of a 19-point agenda,

23:39.320 --> 23:43.438
and I feel by the time you reach item two,
they'll have actually built the supermarket.

23:43.880 --> 23:47.236
You are an excellent shopper, sir.

23:47.320 --> 23:49.276
Why, thank you.

23:49.360 --> 23:51.476
I did a special course at college.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.790
God. I am absolutely knackered.

23:53.880 --> 23:56.952
Not too knackered, I hope.
- Why?

23:57.040 --> 23:58.632
Well, Pete's out.

23:58.720 --> 24:00.438
Yeah?

24:00.520 --> 24:02.078
We've got the house to ourselves.

24:02.160 --> 24:05.391
Yeah, for a couple of hours, at least.
Why, what do you have in mind?

24:12.560 --> 24:16.633
What's brought all this on? - I don't
know. Maybe it was all that shopping.

24:20.040 --> 24:21.996
You are aroused by shopping?

24:22.080 --> 24:24.674
Does that make me a bad person?
- I think it probably does.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.392
<i>We could see the world.</i>

24:28.480 --> 24:30.357
<i>South America.</i>

24:30.440 --> 24:31.668
<i>Australia.</i>

24:31.760 --> 24:32.988
<i>India.</i>

24:33.080 --> 24:34.274
<i>Hm. Great!</i>

24:34.360 --> 24:36.112
<i>I've always fancied India.</i>

24:38.480 --> 24:41.199
Seems a bit ambitious for two weeks, though,
doesn't it?

24:41.280 --> 24:43.794
It doesn't have to be for two weeks.

24:43.880 --> 24:46.394
I could ask work for a month off.
A sabbatical.

24:46.480 --> 24:47.913
Well, that's fine for you,

24:48.000 --> 24:51.629
but my company's bollocksed if I'm
not there.

24:51.720 --> 24:55.395
The important thing to remember is
that we can do whatever we want.

24:57.440 --> 24:59.476
Two more years of freedom.

24:59.560 --> 25:01.471
Yeah?

25:01.560 --> 25:03.516
Two more years of freedom.

25:06.640 --> 25:11.839
A certain politician once said
that there is no such thing as society.

25:12.880 --> 25:17.032
Well, as I look around this hall tonight,
that's not what I see.

25:17.120 --> 25:19.475
I see society.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.516
I see a community.

25:22.920 --> 25:26.435
Now, this isn't just about
a couple of swings and slides.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.829
Or property prices. No.

25:28.920 --> 25:31.878
It's about other people's children.

25:31.960 --> 25:35.953
Children who don't have
three-quarters of an acre to run around in.

25:36.400 --> 25:40.791
The insidious erosion of their
quality of life.

25:42.920 --> 25:45.559
Now, I'm no hypocrite.

25:45.640 --> 25:48.108
I use supermarkets.

25:48.200 --> 25:50.236
And yes, I want convenience.

25:50.320 --> 25:52.675
Yes, I want groceries.

25:53.600 --> 25:55.556
But not at any price.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.396
For when it comes down to it,

25:59.480 --> 26:03.439
what price sticker
can you put on the smile of a child?

26:35.720 --> 26:38.678
Thanks. OK.

26:38.760 --> 26:40.751
<i>Ah, you should have been there, Karen.</i>

26:40.840 --> 26:44.150
Felt the atmosphere. It was electric.
- I'm sure you were an inspiration.

26:44.240 --> 26:45.832
So, the playground's saved, is it?

26:45.920 --> 26:48.036
Well, obviously, there's still
a long way to go,

26:48.120 --> 26:50.554
but now the Playground Task Force
is up and running...

26:50.640 --> 26:52.232
The Playground Task Force?

26:52.320 --> 26:53.435
Task Force. Yes.

26:53.520 --> 26:57.308
David, it's two swings and a slide.
It's hardly the Guns Of Navarone, is it?

26:57.400 --> 27:00.233
Well, you were the one
who went on about quality of life.

27:00.320 --> 27:03.915
So I suppose you must be
the newly appointed Playground Tsar?

27:04.960 --> 27:06.154
Yes.

27:09.680 --> 27:11.636
I don't think you're taking me seriously.

27:11.720 --> 27:14.234
So, where did you go for a drink?
- Sorry?

27:14.320 --> 27:16.276
You've been drinking.

27:16.360 --> 27:20.239
Oh, just a quick pint, you know,
with my comrades.

27:20.320 --> 27:24.518
Well, I've been sort of
off the political scene recently.

27:25.840 --> 27:29.150
I was pretty active
with the anti-Apartheid movement, of course,

27:29.240 --> 27:31.834
but not that much since then,
so I suppose...

27:31.920 --> 27:34.480
Yeah, it's politics with a small P.

27:35.480 --> 27:38.950
So, would you describe yourself
as a socialist?

27:39.040 --> 27:41.998
A socialist? Um...

27:42.520 --> 27:44.954
How about socialist with a small S?

27:46.160 --> 27:47.479
How small?

27:48.520 --> 27:49.635
That small.

27:50.520 --> 27:53.080
Yeah, well, I suppose I would. Yeah.

27:53.160 --> 27:54.912
If the S were small enough.

27:57.520 --> 28:01.354
David, I wanted to ask you something.

28:01.440 --> 28:04.398
But I'm worried it's a bit forward.

28:04.480 --> 28:06.789
Well, you'll never find out until you try.

28:06.880 --> 28:09.838
OK. I wonder...

28:11.080 --> 28:13.913
Have you ever considered
joining the Labour Party?

28:15.600 --> 28:16.874
<i>The Labour Party?</i>

28:16.960 --> 28:19.394
New Labour, actually. Is that so surprising?

28:19.480 --> 28:25.157
Well, yes, it is, actually, seeing as the only
organisation you've ever joined is the RAC.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.079
Do you want to go upstairs?

28:34.160 --> 28:37.038
Are you sure?
- No... I think I'm sure, yeah.

28:39.080 --> 28:40.638
Sorry, Robert.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.676
I'm a nervous wreck, aren't I?

28:42.760 --> 28:46.355
I haven't been in this position for years.
15 years.

28:46.440 --> 28:49.557
I'm like a teenager, aren't I?
I'm shaking and everything. Pathetic.

28:49.640 --> 28:52.438
Jenny, it's fine. Look, do you want
me to go?

28:53.640 --> 28:55.596
No, I don't.

28:58.760 --> 29:00.830
Look, we can just...

29:00.920 --> 29:02.876
you know, go upstairs?

29:02.960 --> 29:04.996
We don't have to do anything.

29:05.080 --> 29:07.435
Just...have a cuddle, and...

29:10.360 --> 29:12.316
..just go to sleep, yeah?

29:14.520 --> 29:16.988
Actually, I think I quite want sex.

29:21.160 --> 29:25.597
Hello. Our first visitors.
You must be Adam...and Rachel.

29:25.680 --> 29:30.629
I assume I got that the right way round?
Come in, come in. Pete's upstairs.

29:30.720 --> 29:32.312
Thanks.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.356
<i>I'd just like to say a few words.</i>

29:34.440 --> 29:36.670
Whilst it's been a pleasure having
you to stay,

29:36.760 --> 29:39.149
it's even more of a pleasure
having you move out.

29:39.240 --> 29:42.710
So, if I may, I'd like to propose
a toast to...

29:42.800 --> 29:44.552
the future.

29:44.640 --> 29:46.198
The future.

29:50.680 --> 29:53.194
Well, I suppose it'll do.
For the time being, anyway.

29:53.280 --> 29:56.113
Yeah. Hey, it'll certainly make a change,
living with a gay guy.

29:56.200 --> 29:57.838
Who's a gay guy?

29:57.920 --> 29:59.319
Your landlord.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.868
Matthew? Matthew's not gay.

30:01.960 --> 30:04.554
Why are there photos of him
and his boyfriend in the hall?

30:04.640 --> 30:08.553
That's just his best mate.
I've got pictures of you and me.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.916
Yeah. Not of us holding hands
in our swimming trunks, though.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.991
What about all those musical soundtracks?

30:14.080 --> 30:16.036
Loads of straight blokes like musicals.

30:16.120 --> 30:19.351
I loved Les Mis.
Anyway, he can't be gay, he's divorced.

30:22.200 --> 30:23.758
Did you seriously not know?

30:23.840 --> 30:26.274
It'll be interesting, a whole new lifestyle.

30:26.360 --> 30:29.477
He could teach you how to cook.
- And dance down Canal Street.

30:29.560 --> 30:32.552
And at least you'll know
this place will always be neat.

30:32.640 --> 30:34.631
Will you stop laughing at me?

30:34.720 --> 30:38.838
I cannot tell you how sick I am
of watching you two laugh at me.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.150
Sorry, Pete. We were just having
a bit of fun.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.117
That's all it is to you - a bit of fun!

30:43.200 --> 30:47.159
You sit there all smug, and then it's
back to your cosy little love nest,

30:47.240 --> 30:50.676
while I sit here in this dump
going out of my skull with loneliness.

30:51.560 --> 30:53.516
Pete, come on. It's not that bad.

30:53.600 --> 30:57.513
Adam! How can you say that?
Look at me - I'm falling to bits.

30:57.600 --> 31:01.229
I've lost my family. I'm in a job
that I loathe with people I hate.

31:01.320 --> 31:04.437
My friends think I'm some sort of joke.
Jenny despises me.

31:04.520 --> 31:06.795
Jenny doesn't despise you.
- Rachel!

31:06.880 --> 31:09.155
She flinches when I go to touch her.

31:09.240 --> 31:12.038
My wife. Can you imagine what that's like?

31:13.360 --> 31:15.476
And now I look at Jenny. She's fine.

31:15.560 --> 31:19.633
She's flying. Dumping me was the best thing
that could have ever happened to her.

31:19.720 --> 31:22.632
And meanwhile there's me -
the best part of my life over,

31:22.720 --> 31:27.316
living here in some shithole
with a three-bar fire...

31:28.440 --> 31:33.309
..an empty bed and just some lonely,
weird old queen for company.

31:33.400 --> 31:38.269
Now, you tell me,
could it possibly, possibly get any worse?

31:38.360 --> 31:39.554
Well, tell me!

31:42.880 --> 31:46.350
I did knock,
but I don't think you could have heard me.

31:46.440 --> 31:48.874
Er...flat-warming present.

31:50.400 --> 31:54.279
I hope you'll be very happy here, Pete.

31:54.360 --> 31:56.954
If you want me, I'll be downstairs,

31:57.040 --> 31:59.395
Listening to my Judy Garland records...

31:59.480 --> 32:03.678
flower arranging,
ironing my bandanna, that sort of thing.

32:03.760 --> 32:05.716
Well, good night.

32:09.080 --> 32:13.039
Morning, Barry. How was your weekend?
Action-packed?

32:16.480 --> 32:18.436
What's the matter with you?

32:18.520 --> 32:21.114
The supervisor wants to see you
in his office.

32:21.200 --> 32:24.590
Oh, God! Here we go again.

32:25.640 --> 32:28.677
<i>They're very strict on personal phone calls.</i>

32:28.760 --> 32:31.558
<i>They beat you to death with rolls of
fax paper if they catch you.</i>

32:31.640 --> 32:33.949
Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

32:34.040 --> 32:36.315
That is someone impersonating me.

32:36.400 --> 32:40.632
We do take matters like this very seriously,
Mrs Gifford.

32:40.720 --> 32:43.075
I'm afraid
we'll have to issue a formal warning.

32:43.160 --> 32:45.071
What? For making a joke?

32:45.160 --> 32:48.118
It's our policy to regularly screen
employees' calls.

32:48.200 --> 32:51.590
If you have any complaints,
I suggest you take it up with your agency.

32:51.680 --> 32:54.399
Right. Thanks very much.

32:54.480 --> 32:59.190
Listen, just out of interest, how many more
formal warnings do I get before I get fired?

32:59.280 --> 33:00.838
Just the one.

33:00.920 --> 33:02.876
Good.

33:08.880 --> 33:10.916
Will that do it?

33:30.720 --> 33:32.199
See you, Barry.

33:32.280 --> 33:34.236
Keep in touch.

33:37.560 --> 33:40.836
Thanks for coming round, you two.
I was starting to feel a bit mad.

33:40.920 --> 33:42.956
What happened to the joys of motherhood?

33:43.040 --> 33:44.678
It's a myth.

33:44.760 --> 33:50.153
I just miss adults. Big, properly proportioned
people who can walk and talk, and eat solids.

33:50.240 --> 33:52.037
David's never here.

33:52.120 --> 33:55.430
Especially since he's discovered
radical politics.

33:55.520 --> 33:59.229
Even when he is,
we're too tired to do anything except grunt.

33:59.320 --> 34:01.072
I'm spending so much time with Ramona,

34:01.160 --> 34:03.799
I'm beginning to think English
is my second language.

34:03.880 --> 34:06.792
I swear to God,
you two don't know how lucky you are.

34:06.880 --> 34:08.710
Why are we lucky?

34:08.800 --> 34:09.676
Sorry?

34:09.760 --> 34:12.353
You, Pete, Jen,
you all keep telling us how lucky we are.

34:12.440 --> 34:15.112
I don't feel that lucky. Why are
we lucky? Tell us.

34:15.199 --> 34:18.397
Well, because you've got your freedom.

34:18.480 --> 34:19.913
You mean we don't have kids?

34:20.000 --> 34:21.956
Well, no. You don't yet, do you?

34:23.000 --> 34:26.549
Well, I'm sure you will eventually, but...

34:26.639 --> 34:30.428
Sorry. Have I said something wrong?
- No, of course you haven't. Adam...

34:30.520 --> 34:33.431
What if we can't have them, eh?
Will we still feel lucky then?

34:33.520 --> 34:35.431
We can have them.

34:35.520 --> 34:37.750
We were going to talk about it
in two years' time.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.989
Because we're too scared to talk
about it now.

34:40.080 --> 34:42.753
I think I'll go and check up on the twins.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.393
What is wrong with you?

34:47.480 --> 34:49.436
What is wrong with me?
- Yes.

34:49.520 --> 34:51.590
Have you forgotten, Rachel, I had cancer?

34:51.679 --> 34:53.033
Yes, but you're better now.

34:53.120 --> 34:55.076
Maybe I am, maybe I'm not.

34:55.159 --> 34:59.517
Rachel, why are we avoiding this subject?
Why don't we just come out and say it?

34:59.600 --> 35:02.398
I might be infertile.
- And you might not be.

35:02.480 --> 35:05.677
You don't get it, do you?
I thought you were pregnant.

35:05.760 --> 35:09.435
I thought you were going to have our baby.
You led me to believe you were pregnant.

35:09.520 --> 35:13.559
Adam, that is not fair... - Then you
tell me it was all a stupid false alarm.

35:13.640 --> 35:14.789
You said you didn't mind.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.110
Well, I lied, then! I lied!

35:17.200 --> 35:19.998
Don't you think I wasn't disappointed?

35:20.080 --> 35:23.231
Eh? I want us to have children too,
you know.

35:23.320 --> 35:27.393
So, why aren't we? Why can't we just
come out and say, ''We want babies''?

35:27.480 --> 35:31.029
Because we can't,
and we're scared it will all be my fault.

35:32.120 --> 35:34.315
It's not your fault! It's nobody's fault.

35:34.400 --> 35:37.949
It's easy for you to say. You're all right.
We all know you can have a baby!

35:38.040 --> 35:40.429
Is that what this is about? Hey?

35:40.520 --> 35:42.476
No. No. Of course not.

35:42.560 --> 35:46.997
You're blaming me because of the abortion.
You think it's all my fault?

35:47.080 --> 35:49.833
Rachel, that's not what I meant
to say. I didn't...

35:57.920 --> 36:02.596
<i>You know,
if there's a more pig-ignorant, fat-headed,</i>

36:02.680 --> 36:05.877
big-mouthed little bollocks out there,
I'd like to meet him.

36:07.680 --> 36:10.194
Oh, Rachel, I'm sorry.

36:10.280 --> 36:11.838
Come here.

36:20.320 --> 36:24.313
Sweetheart,
we can't let this ruin things between us.

36:26.800 --> 36:31.590
You're right. We should face facts,
but...let's not let it mess us up.

36:31.680 --> 36:34.319
What are we gonna do?

36:35.320 --> 36:37.629
I think...

36:37.720 --> 36:39.915
I think we should go and see a specialist.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.956
Oh, God!

36:42.040 --> 36:46.158
You banked some sperm. You must have known
that one day we might have to use it.

36:46.240 --> 36:49.596
I suppose so.
- Well, maybe that time is now.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.839
I'm so happy at the moment.

36:55.920 --> 36:59.151
Just us doing what we want to do, but...

37:00.680 --> 37:02.750
..I don't want it to be just us any more.

37:05.200 --> 37:10.115
And I don't want a new kitchen, or to go
to India, or to concentrate on my career.

37:10.200 --> 37:12.191
I want us to start a family.

37:12.280 --> 37:14.475
I know, I know. Me too.

37:14.560 --> 37:18.235
You know, doctors, and tests,
and treatment...

37:19.600 --> 37:22.990
It just all sounds like such a nightmare.

37:23.080 --> 37:25.958
Well, that depends on how you look at it,
doesn't it?

37:27.760 --> 37:30.797
You could see it as a nightmare, or...

37:30.880 --> 37:34.236
you can see it as an exciting adventure.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.195
An exciting adventure?

37:38.280 --> 37:40.236
Mm.

37:40.320 --> 37:43.790
So, which member of the Famous Five are you?

37:45.040 --> 37:48.350
Right. What's my next assignment?

37:48.440 --> 37:52.592
Well, let me see. We've just had a call
from a china shop. They need a bull.

37:52.680 --> 37:53.954
Sorry?

37:54.040 --> 37:56.998
Jenny, I'm afraid there isn't going to be
a next assignment.

37:57.080 --> 37:59.275
You're messing about, aren't you?

37:59.360 --> 38:03.069
Every job, you've either been sacked,
or you resigned before they could sack you.

38:03.160 --> 38:06.277
Come on. There must be something.

38:06.360 --> 38:08.316
Not during peacetime, no.

38:09.960 --> 38:11.916
<i>Maybe I'm just unemployable.</i>

38:13.160 --> 38:16.277
<i>Maybe you're just not very good
at being told what to do.</i>

38:16.360 --> 38:17.952
Maybe.

38:18.040 --> 38:20.759
So, what are you going to do?

38:20.840 --> 38:26.233
I don't know. Waitressing or bar work,
I suppose. It'll be all right.

38:26.320 --> 38:30.438
I'll just... I'll ask around at some
restaurants this weekend. It'll be fine.

38:30.520 --> 38:32.272
Er...

38:32.360 --> 38:33.429
What?

38:33.520 --> 38:34.953
About this weekend.

38:35.040 --> 38:38.350
Oh, yeah?
- I was hoping you'd be free.

38:38.440 --> 38:40.351
Why?

38:40.440 --> 38:45.514
Well... I thought we'd take a little trip.

38:48.440 --> 38:50.396
New York! You're bloody joking!

38:50.480 --> 38:53.472
It's only for the weekend.
- No. No way! What about Adam?

38:53.560 --> 38:56.870
It's your weekend to have him.
- No, from Saturday morning onwards!

38:56.960 --> 38:58.916
What, and you can't pick him up on Friday?

38:59.000 --> 39:02.788
Cos you've got plans with Cindy Crawford?
- That is not the point!

39:02.880 --> 39:07.590
The point is you cannot bear the thought
of me having any fun, can you?

39:07.680 --> 39:11.229
No, you'd rather I sat on my fat arse
and felt sorry for myself.

39:11.320 --> 39:13.595
Jesus Christ, you can be a selfish cow!

39:13.680 --> 39:16.558
Yeah, and you can be
a self-pitying, stupid bastard!

39:16.640 --> 39:17.914
Oh, shut up! Christ!

39:18.000 --> 39:19.319
God!

39:20.720 --> 39:23.473
We're not handling this very well, are we?

39:23.560 --> 39:26.199
No. No, not really. No.

39:26.280 --> 39:28.669
Look, you know I've always
wanted to go to New York.

39:28.760 --> 39:31.354
Well, that's half the problem, isn't it?
- What is?

39:33.920 --> 39:36.480
Because I always wanted to take you.

39:36.560 --> 39:39.199
Pete, you know that's not going
to happen now.

39:40.360 --> 39:42.635
Look, I'm sorry. I am.

39:43.680 --> 39:44.954
But I like Robert.

39:45.040 --> 39:49.511
I don't know what's gonna happen,
if it's serious or what, but I like him,

39:49.600 --> 39:53.195
and I really need the company,
and I want to move on,

39:53.280 --> 39:57.512
and I'm really sorry if you're upset,
but I've been unhappy for a long time,

39:57.600 --> 39:59.909
and I just think this is unfair.

40:02.640 --> 40:05.200
You're not going to change your
mind, are you?

40:05.280 --> 40:07.236
No.

40:07.320 --> 40:08.799
No, I'm not.

40:14.320 --> 40:17.073
So, you took
the precaution of banking some sperm?

40:17.160 --> 40:20.630
When I had the radiotherapy, yes.
- Very wise. Do you know how much?

40:20.720 --> 40:22.676
How much? Erm...

40:22.760 --> 40:24.751
More than a teaspoonful, less than a pint.

40:24.840 --> 40:27.308
Actually, it was quite hard getting
it into the wee jar.

40:27.400 --> 40:32.076
Why? Is that important? - It is if
you were planning artificial insemination.

40:32.160 --> 40:34.628
If Adam's supply is cut off, so to speak,

40:34.720 --> 40:38.679
then there's a possibility that after
a few treatments we might just run out.

40:38.760 --> 40:40.159
And so what's the alternative?

40:40.240 --> 40:43.118
Intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection.

40:43.200 --> 40:47.273
If your sperm is in short supply,
it's the best option, best option...

40:47.360 --> 40:51.956
It's pretty much the same as IVF,
but we inject a single sperm into the egg.

40:52.040 --> 40:54.429
<i>It takes place externally.</i>

40:54.520 --> 40:56.715
<i>We'd have to remove a number
of eggs, Rachel.</i>

40:58.000 --> 40:59.194
The procedure...

41:00.520 --> 41:02.112
..which we can pop back in.

41:06.160 --> 41:07.718
Whatever you choose to do,

41:07.800 --> 41:11.952
I think it's probably safe to say it's
the most difficult decision you'll ever make.

41:14.200 --> 41:16.509
<i>Are you familiar
with the word emasculation?</i>

41:16.600 --> 41:18.556
Emasculation?

41:18.640 --> 41:20.596
Horrible, isn't it?

41:22.320 --> 41:26.313
I always thought I was
this little bundle of testosterone.

41:26.400 --> 41:31.349
Whenever I slept with someone -
and God knows, I've done my share -

41:31.440 --> 41:34.671
afterwards, I'd always lie there and think,

41:34.760 --> 41:39.197
''Please God, I hope they're not pregnant,
what with me being such a man and all.''

41:40.240 --> 41:43.118
I thought if a woman sipped my pint
she'd have twins.

41:45.880 --> 41:50.317
But now, with Rachel, for the first time,
I'm thinking,

41:51.360 --> 41:53.316
''Please, God...

41:54.800 --> 41:56.950
will you please just let us have a baby?''

41:59.200 --> 42:02.237
All that time, I treated sex as...

42:02.320 --> 42:05.118
recreation, fun, a laugh...

42:06.200 --> 42:08.475
..and then, all of a sudden,
I realise what it's for.

42:08.560 --> 42:13.475
This very simple, very ordinary,
yet beautiful thing.

42:17.080 --> 42:19.036
And I can't manage it.

42:20.120 --> 42:22.190
I can't manage it.

42:22.960 --> 42:25.679
<i>I feel llke I'm being punished.</i>

42:25.760 --> 42:28.752
God, listen to me talking like a Catholic.

42:30.120 --> 42:32.509
What does Rachel think about the idea?

42:32.600 --> 42:34.556
About the treatment?

42:34.680 --> 42:36.955
I'm excited, but I'm scared too.

42:38.880 --> 42:41.713
Basically, if a doctor says there's
this procedure

42:41.800 --> 42:45.554
that's stressful, painful
and fantastically expensive,

42:45.640 --> 42:50.839
you're not exactly going to say,
'''Way-hey, book me in'', are you?

42:50.920 --> 42:53.559
What does Adam think?

42:53.640 --> 42:56.279
I don't know. He hasn't said yet.

42:56.360 --> 42:58.396
I think he's worried about the money.

42:58.480 --> 42:59.390
Four grand!

42:59.480 --> 43:02.631
Per treatment. Times that by four
or five, maybe.

43:04.040 --> 43:06.315
Blimey.

43:06.400 --> 43:08.356
Right, I'll get the next round in.

43:08.440 --> 43:10.396
You put your money away.

43:10.480 --> 43:11.549
Scratchings?

43:12.600 --> 43:13.919
It's not just the money, is it?

43:14.000 --> 43:19.518
It's...you know, the stress, the anxiety,
and there are all these other questions.

43:20.880 --> 43:23.189
What if there's something wrong
with Adam's sperm?

43:23.280 --> 43:26.636
Are we going to use a sperm donor?
Some complete stranger?

43:26.720 --> 43:30.793
Well, it needn't be a stranger.
You could ask someone you already know.

43:30.880 --> 43:34.111
Darling, have you seen my golf shoes?
- Cupboard under the stairs.

43:34.200 --> 43:36.350
Right.

43:36.440 --> 43:40.399
Don't worry. I wasn't going to suggest it.

43:42.400 --> 43:45.472
If you ever do run out of sperm,
I've got loads going spare.

43:45.560 --> 43:48.199
Thanks, Pete. I'm touched.

43:48.280 --> 43:50.236
Disturbed but touched.

43:51.920 --> 43:53.956
So, anyway, now you know.

43:54.040 --> 43:57.715
I'm sorry, mate. I had no idea. - It's
all right. You've got enough to worry about.

43:57.800 --> 43:59.119
Yeah.

43:59.200 --> 44:01.156
So, did Jenny tell you about New York?

44:01.240 --> 44:02.753
Uh-huh.

44:02.840 --> 44:05.229
Do you think I'm being a bastard?

44:05.320 --> 44:10.110
I think Jenny's having fun and you're not,
and that's hard.

44:10.200 --> 44:12.475
Still, it's like that Sting song, isn't it?

44:12.560 --> 44:14.847
Englishman In New York?
- No.

44:15.320 --> 44:17.515
Russians? Dream Of The Blue Turtles?

44:17.600 --> 44:20.717
No. If You Love Somebody Set Them Free.

44:21.760 --> 44:24.274
I suppose so.

44:25.360 --> 44:28.750
I can't help it, though. I bloody hate
that bloke. - Who? Robert?

44:28.840 --> 44:30.831
No, Sting.

44:31.920 --> 44:35.515
<i>Tottenham in front
within three mlnutes of the re-start.</i>

44:36.720 --> 44:38.836
I'm sorry about the other day.

44:38.920 --> 44:40.956
It's all right.

44:41.040 --> 44:44.271
If it's going to be a problem, though,
it might be a good idea to move out.

44:44.360 --> 44:49.388
No, no, no, it's all right. It's just
I've been under a bit of stress lately.

44:49.480 --> 44:51.436
Yeah. I know what it's like.

44:51.520 --> 44:54.876
Me and my wife had a terrible break-up.

44:54.960 --> 44:57.554
What happened?

44:57.640 --> 45:01.713
She caught me in bed
with our next-door neighbour. Patrick.

45:03.360 --> 45:05.316
Right.

45:06.240 --> 45:08.470
So, you don't think she over-reacted?

45:15.160 --> 45:17.116
So?

45:18.160 --> 45:20.276
So...

45:21.480 --> 45:23.914
We're gonna do this, yes?

45:24.000 --> 45:27.117
Yeah. But together, yeah?

45:28.160 --> 45:30.116
Oh, yeah.

45:30.200 --> 45:33.476
And we're gonna look after each other
all the time, yeah?

45:33.560 --> 45:36.120
Yeah.

45:36.200 --> 45:38.760
And while we're waiting for the doctors
and all that...

45:38.840 --> 45:39.829
Mm-hm?

45:39.920 --> 45:45.199
..we're gonna keep trying naturally at
every single possible available opportunity.

45:45.280 --> 45:47.236
Yeah?

45:47.320 --> 45:49.276
Ooh, yeah.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.956
Hello?
- Hi, it's me.

45:58.040 --> 46:01.828
Don't worry. I'm not phoning to moan
or shout or anything.

46:01.920 --> 46:03.319
That's a shame.

46:03.400 --> 46:07.279
I just wanted to say, I'm still trying
to get used to the idea, but next weekend -

46:07.360 --> 46:11.194
you can go to New York with Robert
or whatever his name is,

46:11.280 --> 46:13.236
and I'll look after Adam, all right?

46:14.800 --> 46:15.869
Are you sure?

46:15.960 --> 46:18.030
Of course I'm sure. He's my son, isn't he?

46:18.120 --> 46:22.079
Right. Listen, where are you living?
What's going on?

46:22.160 --> 46:24.390
I've got a new place. It's great.

46:24.480 --> 46:27.756
It's got ceilings, walls, the lot.
I've got a great landlord.

46:27.840 --> 46:29.273
You'll have to come round.

46:29.360 --> 46:31.316
Listen, that's brilliant.

46:32.360 --> 46:34.794
Thanks, Pete.
- That's all right.

46:36.560 --> 46:38.994
Um, how are you? Are you all right?

46:39.080 --> 46:41.036
Yeah, I think I am.

46:41.120 --> 46:43.475
Yeah. I'm all right.

46:43.560 --> 46:46.757
Hey, Jenny, give my regards to Broadway,
yeah?

46:46.840 --> 46:48.796
Yeah.

46:48.880 --> 46:50.836
Thanks, Pete. Bye.
