WEBVTT

01:36.861 --> 01:39.238
I'm glad you
brought up nepotism, Senator.

01:39.321 --> 01:42.742
Um, if this were an outright
appointment, that would be one thing,

01:42.825 --> 01:45.828
but in this case,
the president can only nominate.

01:45.911 --> 01:48.205
It's the Senate that deems me worthy.

01:48.289 --> 01:50.708
I'm here to convince you that I am.

01:50.791 --> 01:54.503
Although, I must admit, my husband never
remembers to put the toilet seat down,

01:54.587 --> 01:56.922
so he could be trying
to make it up to me.

01:58.090 --> 02:01.135
My larger concern is your experience.
You have very little.

02:01.218 --> 02:04.638
Well, a decade ago,
I founded a small nonprofit

02:04.722 --> 02:07.308
and I built it into
a major global player.

02:07.391 --> 02:11.103
I shepherded a number of bills
through Congress on its behalf.

02:11.187 --> 02:15.024
And over the last year, I've dedicated
myself to sexual assault reform,

02:15.107 --> 02:17.359
and have made meaningful strides.

02:17.443 --> 02:20.362
Now, while this
may not qualify as statecraft,

02:20.446 --> 02:22.698
it does illustrate my effectiveness,

02:22.782 --> 02:25.910
the same effectiveness I plan
on bringing to the United Nations.

02:25.993 --> 02:29.497
Thank you, Mrs. Underwood.
I yield the remainder of my time.

02:30.998 --> 02:34.543
Uh, Mrs. Wallace of North Dakota,
you have eight minutes.

02:34.627 --> 02:36.587
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

02:36.670 --> 02:39.882
Mrs. Underwood,
allow me to get specific.

02:39.965 --> 02:43.427
What is your take
on UN Resolution 9214,

02:43.511 --> 02:46.764
the imposition of sanctions
on the Congo for the...

02:46.847 --> 02:49.683
The illegal mining and smuggling
of mineral resources.

02:49.767 --> 02:52.895
Yes. The United States voted
against this resolution.

02:52.978 --> 02:56.649
The DRC is already wracked
with economic hardship,

02:56.732 --> 02:58.442
compounded by an unstable government.

02:58.526 --> 03:02.613
It ranks 192 out of 194
in GDP per capita.

03:02.696 --> 03:05.241
I think we need
to encourage foreign investment

03:05.324 --> 03:07.451
and develop new forms of economic growth

03:07.535 --> 03:11.080
rather than make one of the world's
poorest countries even poorer.

03:11.163 --> 03:13.165
From a national security perspective,

03:13.249 --> 03:16.919
the United States maintains a strong
interest in the success of the DRC.

03:17.002 --> 03:19.171
- We want a stable nation...
- They're here.

03:19.255 --> 03:21.924
...that can help us
in combating the spread

03:22.007 --> 03:25.135
of Islamic radicalism
throughout the continent.

03:25.219 --> 03:28.180
And in order to achieve that,
we need to work as its ally,

03:28.264 --> 03:29.807
not its disciplinarian.

03:33.060 --> 03:34.186
Good morning.

03:34.270 --> 03:35.270
Mr. President.

03:38.107 --> 03:40.776
Jackie. Terry.

03:40.860 --> 03:42.361
Shall we?

03:42.444 --> 03:45.489
Now you all have the, uh... overview.
But what we have here today

03:45.573 --> 03:47.992
- is the comprehensive breakdown...
- Sir, before we begin...

03:48.075 --> 03:50.786
Look, Bob, I know you have some
serious doubts about this program.

03:50.870 --> 03:53.664
But just let me flesh it out first,
and then I promise

03:53.747 --> 03:56.208
we can address any questions
that you might have.

03:56.292 --> 03:58.627
- Uh, Mr. President...
- Ten million jobs.

03:58.711 --> 04:01.463
Can we all agree that that's
a good thing for this country?

04:01.547 --> 04:03.215
Universal employment.

04:03.299 --> 04:06.177
It's the key for our keeping
the White House in 2016.

04:06.260 --> 04:09.305
It's the only chance we have
of winning back majorities in Congress.

04:09.388 --> 04:11.348
Now, the election's
only 18 months away.

04:11.432 --> 04:14.476
We need to do something bold,
something decisive.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.437
We need to redefine our party.

04:16.519 --> 04:18.731
Actually, that's what
we wanted to discuss.

04:18.814 --> 04:20.654
You're right, we do need
to redefine the party.

04:20.690 --> 04:22.151
We need to do it
with a fresh face.

04:22.234 --> 04:24.653
2016. We don't want you to run.

04:24.737 --> 04:27.239
You weren't even elected
to the office in the first place.

04:27.323 --> 04:29.950
The pardons hurt you.
Approvals are low.

04:30.034 --> 04:31.327
We're not casting blame, sir.

04:31.410 --> 04:34.455
We just believe that this
is best for the party.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:44.006 --> 04:46.884
I suspected this was coming,
but months from now.

04:46.967 --> 04:49.803
I was hoping by then I'd have something
to show for my efforts,

04:49.887 --> 04:52.556
that I could preempt their doubts
with progress.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.351
They're nervous.
They're being impulsive.

04:55.434 --> 04:58.354
It's a bit early
to be deciding something like this.

04:58.437 --> 05:00.940
Shouldn't we revisit this
when we're closer to the primaries?

05:01.023 --> 05:02.483
What do you think, Terry?

05:02.566 --> 05:04.967
Like you said, sir, we only
have 18 months until the general.

05:04.985 --> 05:06.278
Less than half of that to Iowa.

05:06.362 --> 05:08.155
We would want to settle
on a candidate soon.

05:08.239 --> 05:09.879
Someone who the whole party
can get behind

05:09.907 --> 05:11.787
like the Republicans
are getting behind Mendoza.

05:11.825 --> 05:12.993
And who would that be?

05:13.077 --> 05:14.787
We haven't had
a discussion on that yet.

05:14.870 --> 05:16.914
We came to you first, out of respect.

05:16.997 --> 05:20.167
- Well, there must be a shortlist.
- No, not yet.

05:20.251 --> 05:22.586
It'll be a process
to find the right person.

05:22.670 --> 05:25.256
And we were hoping that
you would be a part of that process.

05:25.339 --> 05:27.883
Obviously, this is a request,
Mr. President.

05:27.967 --> 05:29.385
It's your decision.

05:29.468 --> 05:32.721
But if you do run, sir,
you won't have our support.

05:34.014 --> 05:35.641
Jackie?

05:37.810 --> 05:40.020
I stand by the rest of the leadership.

05:43.357 --> 05:45.651
Well, this is certainly a lot
to think about.

05:45.734 --> 05:48.654
Let's table our discussion
on America Works for another time,

05:48.737 --> 05:50.572
but thank you all
for being so forthright.

05:50.656 --> 05:52.908
I'll get back to you
on this issue a little later on.

05:52.992 --> 05:54.952
Would you like us
to stick around for a while?

05:55.035 --> 05:57.246
We wouldn't want the press
to think we came all the way here

05:57.329 --> 05:59.490
- for a five-minute meeting.
- That's a very good idea.

05:59.498 --> 06:00.749
No raised eyebrows.

06:00.833 --> 06:03.502
I'll have some refreshments sent
for you into the Map Room.

06:03.585 --> 06:04.837
Wonderful.

06:04.920 --> 06:06.380
Thank you, Mr. President.

06:15.889 --> 06:19.226
As a vocal proponent for the
Sexual Assault Bill last session,

06:19.309 --> 06:21.790
are you concerned about
your relationship with the US military?

06:21.812 --> 06:23.272
No, I'm not, Senator.

06:23.355 --> 06:25.733
I worked closely
with the Joint Chiefs on that bill.

06:25.816 --> 06:28.861
What if there were a peacekeeping
mission in, say, Burma,

06:28.944 --> 06:33.991
to quell civil unrest, and the United
Nations asked us to contribute troops,

06:34.074 --> 06:36.702
to put our servicemen
and women's lives in peril.

06:36.785 --> 06:38.704
If you're using Myanmar
as a hypothetical,

06:38.787 --> 06:40.987
I think we're a long way from that,
but as Ambassador...

06:40.998 --> 06:43.917
My question concerns
the use of US military.

06:44.001 --> 06:46.837
The US military is irrelevant.
The current situation...

06:46.920 --> 06:50.424
Excuse me, Mrs. Underwood.
The US military is irrelevant?

06:50.507 --> 06:52.468
Well, I... That's not what I said.

06:52.551 --> 06:55.512
You said verbatim:
"The US military is irrelevant."

06:55.596 --> 07:00.476
Well, in the, in the context of...
I meant... uh, that there are plenty...

07:02.061 --> 07:04.980
I have the utmost respect
and appreciation for our troops, sir.

07:05.064 --> 07:06.664
Not with statements
like that, you don't.

07:06.732 --> 07:08.359
Senator,
if I may, I can explain.

07:08.442 --> 07:10.402
How do we explain
to the men and women who serve,

07:10.486 --> 07:11.821
who put their lives on the line,

07:11.904 --> 07:14.281
that our ambassador
thinks they're irrelevant?

07:14.365 --> 07:17.534
I think that's an unfair
characterization of what I intended...

07:17.618 --> 07:20.621
I am not characterizing anything,
Mrs. Underwood, you said the words.

07:20.704 --> 07:22.825
And now you're trying
to backpedal your way out of it.

07:22.831 --> 07:24.500
- You're trying to take my words...
- Don't interrupt me.

07:24.583 --> 07:26.335
If you will stop interrupting me,
I can explain...

07:26.418 --> 07:28.504
No, you see, we ask the questions,
you answer them.

07:28.587 --> 07:31.006
You're not allowing me
to answer the questions, Senator.

07:31.090 --> 07:33.884
If you could maybe listen
instead of grandstanding.

07:36.678 --> 07:38.806
The position
you're being considered for

07:38.889 --> 07:41.016
requires calm, cool diplomacy.

07:42.017 --> 07:46.730
What concerns me even more than
the military comment is your demeanor.

07:47.731 --> 07:50.442
Is this what we're to expect
from our ambassador?

07:50.526 --> 07:52.069
A hothead?

07:54.530 --> 07:57.241
Go ahead, Mrs. Underwood, I'm listening.

07:58.867 --> 08:00.661
Maybe it's leverage for another play.

08:00.744 --> 08:02.746
Scare the wits out of me
and then come with the big ask.

08:02.830 --> 08:05.749
- You sure there is one?
- America Works. They want to kill it.

08:05.833 --> 08:08.877
Or soften me up to consider
another VP candidate for the ticket.

08:08.961 --> 08:10.587
They're no fans of Blythe.

08:10.671 --> 08:12.432
Could be anything,
any combination of things.

08:12.506 --> 08:14.299
- What?
- You saw it?

08:14.383 --> 08:16.802
- Saw what?
- The First Lady, sir.

08:20.556 --> 08:25.602
- Jesus. I better call her.
- She's still in the hearing, sir.

08:25.686 --> 08:28.605
I need to see this whole thing.
Let's get ahead of it if we can.

08:28.689 --> 08:30.450
- The Solicitor General is here.
- Cancel it.

08:30.524 --> 08:32.525
- You've already postponed twice.
- Postpone it again.

08:32.609 --> 08:33.610
We can't put it off, sir.

08:33.693 --> 08:35.571
It goes to the Supreme Court
in less than a month.

08:35.654 --> 08:36.780
We have bigger fish to fry.

08:36.864 --> 08:39.158
An American citizen was injured
by a drone strike.

08:39.241 --> 08:40.741
That Walker authorized, not me.

08:40.826 --> 08:42.828
But you're
the sitting president.

08:42.910 --> 08:44.913
If we lose this,
it undermines your authority.

08:44.997 --> 08:46.290
The media is all over it.

08:46.373 --> 08:48.653
We need our rhetoric in line
with the Solicitor General's.

08:48.709 --> 08:50.294
All right. Christ!
Send her in.

08:50.377 --> 08:52.754
I'll put this clip on your computer,
for when you're done.

08:53.881 --> 08:56.717
Terry Womack. Today. Privately.

09:13.984 --> 09:15.194
Ms. Dunbar.

09:17.196 --> 09:21.492
Before we begin,
I'd like to clear the air.

09:22.284 --> 09:25.954
Your report.
You did good work, necessary work,

09:26.038 --> 09:28.290
and I admire you for it.

09:28.373 --> 09:30.042
I appreciate you saying that, sir.

09:30.125 --> 09:32.711
And you understand the position
I was in with the pardons.

09:32.794 --> 09:35.339
That's politics, sir.
Not my expertise.

09:35.422 --> 09:37.174
What's past is past?

09:37.257 --> 09:40.093
My focus is the argument
I'll present to the court.

09:43.263 --> 09:46.308
She sees me as the bank robber
who made it to the county line.

09:46.391 --> 09:49.853
But she's smart enough
to leave her badge at the door.

09:49.937 --> 09:51.980
So, the case.

09:52.064 --> 09:55.108
As you know, sir, we think
the State secret defense is strong.

09:55.192 --> 09:57.027
When I consulted with the CIA on the...

09:57.110 --> 10:00.948
I'm wondering if State secrets
is the best tactic.

10:01.031 --> 10:03.325
Both of Mahmoud's legs were amputated.

10:03.408 --> 10:06.119
He will be in the gallery,
in his wheelchair.

10:06.203 --> 10:07.996
That's a powerful image.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.832
Even Supreme Court Justices have hearts.

10:10.916 --> 10:12.751
We need to stay in their heads.

10:12.834 --> 10:14.836
A procedural route is clearly...

10:14.920 --> 10:16.547
Excuse me.

10:18.799 --> 10:20.467
Yes?

10:20.551 --> 10:22.219
Uh, tell her I need to watch something

10:22.302 --> 10:24.596
and I'll call her back
from my study in two minutes.

10:24.680 --> 10:26.848
- It's my wife. I'm sorry.
- Please.

10:38.318 --> 10:40.279
- ...you answer them.
- You're not allowing me

10:40.362 --> 10:42.656
to answer questions, Senator.
Maybe you would benefit more

10:42.739 --> 10:44.324
from listening than grandstanding.

10:48.453 --> 10:50.455
I just watched.
How can I help?

10:50.539 --> 10:54.334
I'm calling Senators. I think it would
be heavy-handed if you did too.

10:54.418 --> 10:56.253
Well, I don't blame you
for getting upset.

10:56.336 --> 10:58.547
- You didn't deserve that.
- I'm a target now.

10:58.630 --> 11:02.259
- That's the price of admission.
- We both are.

11:02.342 --> 11:05.262
The leadership,
they don't want me to run.

11:05.345 --> 11:06.930
- What?
- Yeah, that's what they said

11:07.014 --> 11:08.890
before I could even present the program.

11:08.974 --> 11:11.893
- This soon?
- Yeah, that's what surprised me.

11:11.977 --> 11:16.023
- The entire leadership?
- All of them, including Jackie.

11:19.234 --> 11:22.612
- That woman has no sense of loyalty.
- Well, we'll see.

11:22.696 --> 11:25.032
I'm gonna meet with Womack.
Turn him around.

11:25.115 --> 11:27.117
They only have strength in numbers.

11:36.126 --> 11:37.753
Continue, please.

11:37.836 --> 11:41.465
As I was saying, we think
our procedural defense is strong.

11:41.548 --> 11:44.343
State secrets prohibit
the introduction of evidence.

11:44.426 --> 11:46.511
Assuming they won't dismiss outright,

11:46.595 --> 11:49.890
the argument will focus
on deference to the executive.

11:49.973 --> 11:53.435
Separation between the courts
and foreign policy.

11:53.518 --> 11:56.271
They simply don't
have the security intelligence

11:56.355 --> 11:58.857
to second-guess covert operations

11:58.940 --> 12:02.402
while we're facing threats
on multiple fronts.

12:06.239 --> 12:08.200
Sir?

12:08.283 --> 12:11.203
- I can't do this now.
- Excuse me, sir?

12:11.286 --> 12:14.831
My office will be in touch. Apologies.
Thank you very much.

12:17.626 --> 12:20.420
Maybe you would benefit more
from listening than grandstanding.

12:20.504 --> 12:21.922
Joining me now from Capitol Hill,

12:22.005 --> 12:24.132
CNN's Chief Congressional
Correspondent, Dana Bash.

12:24.216 --> 12:27.010
- Dana, what is the mood at the Capitol?
- Right, I understand, but...

12:27.094 --> 12:28.887
We already have several
Senators publicly saying

12:28.970 --> 12:31.973
that they're gonna vote against
Mrs. Underwood because of her comments.

12:32.057 --> 12:34.851
A number of others I've spoken to
have gone from supporting her...

12:34.935 --> 12:36.520
- Right.
- ...to being on the fence.

12:36.603 --> 12:40.524
But, Dana, she's correct, isn't she?
Mendoza was grandstanding.

12:40.607 --> 12:43.026
Maybe. But even so,
if you look at the numbers here,

12:43.110 --> 12:44.361
this is doing real damage.

12:44.444 --> 12:46.321
The vote was always going to be close...

12:46.405 --> 12:47.572
Yes.

12:47.656 --> 12:49.699
...things aren't looking good
for the First Lady.

12:49.783 --> 12:52.452
- No, I understand, but...
- Could her military remark be...

12:52.536 --> 12:54.538
- It's Mendoza.
- ...a slip of the tongue?

12:54.621 --> 12:58.166
I appreciate your time, Senator.
I hope you'll reconsider.

12:58.250 --> 12:59.584
- He's on now?
- Yes.

12:59.668 --> 13:01.336
Turn that off?

13:02.212 --> 13:05.257
Senator, hi.
Thank you for returning my call.

13:05.340 --> 13:08.427
Sorry it took so long.
I had a ton of interview requests.

13:08.510 --> 13:12.597
I just wanted to apologize if I came
across as disrespectful in any way.

13:12.681 --> 13:14.808
- That was wrong of me.
- I know you didn't mean it, Claire.

13:14.891 --> 13:17.978
It's just unfortunate
how things are playing out.

13:18.061 --> 13:21.273
I realize you can't
vote for me yourself,

13:21.356 --> 13:24.860
but I was hoping that maybe you
would say something to the effect to...

13:24.943 --> 13:26.903
What, to the press?

13:26.987 --> 13:30.031
- Or even privately, to your colleagues.
- I can't do that.

13:30.115 --> 13:32.659
Senator, the vote should
center on my merits,

13:32.742 --> 13:34.953
not a few moments
where you and I took the gloves off.

13:35.036 --> 13:36.580
Well, I think that was telling,
don't you?

13:36.663 --> 13:39.249
How you behaved under pressure?

13:39.332 --> 13:42.586
Senator, you know you were
taking out of context what I said.

13:42.669 --> 13:44.713
Of course I was.
I was trying to rile you up.

13:44.796 --> 13:46.047
And I succeeded.

13:46.131 --> 13:48.851
I wish I hadn't, because it's gonna
make things really tough for you.

13:48.884 --> 13:53.597
But, if you can convince my colleagues
to change their minds despite that...

13:53.680 --> 13:55.599
why, you'd make a great Ambassador.

13:55.682 --> 13:58.810
- Thank you for your time, Senator.
- Good luck, Claire.

14:00.562 --> 14:02.606
He's a son of a bitch.

14:02.689 --> 14:04.232
Let's try Peterson next.

14:05.901 --> 14:07.319
Approvals go up and down.

14:07.402 --> 14:10.322
We can't allow ourselves
to be held hostage by public opinion.

14:10.405 --> 14:12.407
We're being held hostage
by the Republicans.

14:12.491 --> 14:15.202
We can't beat them with you
as the face of the party. Period.

14:15.285 --> 14:17.245
Have you all really
thought this through?

14:17.329 --> 14:18.538
I'm a sitting president.

14:18.622 --> 14:20.207
But not an elected one.

14:20.290 --> 14:22.250
But still, to abandon the incumbent,

14:22.334 --> 14:24.377
and all the advantages
that that entails?

14:24.461 --> 14:27.672
Which is the problem.
We don't see any advantages.

14:27.756 --> 14:30.091
And if you were to come on board with us,

14:30.175 --> 14:32.302
if you were to announce
that you're not running,

14:32.385 --> 14:34.429
it wouldn't seem
as if we're abandoning you.

14:34.513 --> 14:36.014
The party looks unified.

14:36.807 --> 14:38.767
Bob Birch has been trying to do me in

14:38.850 --> 14:41.269
since I forced the Education Bill
down his throat.

14:41.353 --> 14:43.980
I think he's using shaky logic
to get you all on board

14:44.064 --> 14:47.234
so he can carry out
some personal vendetta.

14:47.317 --> 14:48.860
It was my idea.

14:50.529 --> 14:51.822
Not Bob's.

14:55.909 --> 14:57.661
I hope you work with us.

14:58.662 --> 15:00.580
We meant it when we said it.

15:01.581 --> 15:04.417
We would like for you
to be a part of the conversation.

15:17.806 --> 15:20.183
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

15:20.267 --> 15:21.977
Hey.

15:22.060 --> 15:24.354
- I can't hear you.
- Hang on a second.

15:31.695 --> 15:32.696
- Seth?
- Yeah.

15:32.779 --> 15:35.020
I was just calling to check in.
See how things are going.

15:35.073 --> 15:38.535
Good. Things are going really good.
Hey, hold on one quick second.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.296
Hey. Listen, uh, I know you're
rolling out the AmWorks program soon.

15:49.379 --> 15:52.841
I'm sure Remy has a plan in place,
but I've been putting together a list.

15:52.924 --> 15:56.094
Some key representatives and what they
might want in exchange for support.

15:56.177 --> 15:58.221
Skeletons in the closet,
that kind of thing.

15:58.305 --> 16:00.223
Yeah, that's on hold for the moment.

16:01.850 --> 16:04.311
- You're not rolling it out?
- It's just on hold.

16:05.937 --> 16:07.981
- Is something up?
- No, everything's fine.

16:08.064 --> 16:10.942
We're focused on the summit
next month with Russia.

16:11.026 --> 16:13.361
But you're good?
You getting stronger?

16:13.445 --> 16:15.947
- Yeah.
- In good spirits?

16:16.031 --> 16:17.741
Never been better.

16:17.824 --> 16:20.243
I'll email you my ideas.
Let me know what he says.

16:20.327 --> 16:22.370
- Will do.
- Thanks.

16:26.291 --> 16:28.501
Senator, when we met
in your office last week,

16:28.585 --> 16:30.295
we had a long,
productive conversation.

16:30.378 --> 16:33.506
I can't imagine ten seconds
during the hearing would...

16:33.590 --> 16:36.468
Senator, may I call you back
in five minutes?

16:36.551 --> 16:38.053
Thank you.

16:43.934 --> 16:46.978
- Francis?
- No luck. It was his idea.

16:48.229 --> 16:49.648
What are you going to do?

16:50.565 --> 16:51.983
Top 50 bundlers from last cycle.

16:52.067 --> 16:54.067
I don't need the leadership
if I can get the money.

16:54.110 --> 16:55.946
- You?
- Too early to tell.

16:56.029 --> 16:57.530
Well, I'm here if you need me.

17:01.034 --> 17:04.371
I've always said that power
is more important than money.

17:04.454 --> 17:08.165
But when it comes to elections,
money gives power...

17:08.249 --> 17:10.502
well, a run for its money.

17:11.544 --> 17:13.088
It's Francis Underwood.

17:22.555 --> 17:24.391
I thought you said he was handsome.

17:25.392 --> 17:26.977
Sorry to interrupt.

17:27.060 --> 17:30.730
Well, if she doesn't receive
a text with the word "urgent,"

17:30.814 --> 17:32.649
it's not an official date.

17:32.732 --> 17:34.150
How are you? Alan Cooke.

17:34.234 --> 17:36.027
- Remy Danton.
- Nice to meet you.

17:36.987 --> 17:39.406
I'm just gonna go, uh...
take a few calls.

17:39.489 --> 17:41.992
There's an espresso coming
with your name on it, okay?

17:42.075 --> 17:43.576
Nice meeting you.

17:48.915 --> 17:50.417
So here we are.

17:50.500 --> 17:53.378
I wasn't part of the decision.
They told me ten minutes before.

17:53.461 --> 17:55.714
Who are they talking to? About running?

17:55.797 --> 17:57.590
No one yet,
as far as I can tell.

17:57.674 --> 18:00.593
There has to at least be a list.
Even a mental one.

18:00.677 --> 18:02.470
Some ideas.

18:03.471 --> 18:05.265
We need you to find out.

18:06.141 --> 18:08.727
You know, when Walker resigned,

18:08.810 --> 18:11.354
Frank's president,
you're Chief of Staff.

18:11.438 --> 18:14.024
- But me?
- You're still in the leadership.

18:14.107 --> 18:16.776
- Assistant Whip.
- It's a bullshit title.

18:16.860 --> 18:19.070
I'm out of the inner circle.

18:20.905 --> 18:23.116
What do you want?

18:23.199 --> 18:26.995
I want to be on the ticket.
His VP.

18:29.205 --> 18:30.915
All we want is a little information.

18:30.999 --> 18:34.669
What you're asking is...
disproportionate.

18:35.837 --> 18:37.881
It's repaying a debt.

18:38.882 --> 18:41.676
A big one.
I whipped the votes for impeachment.

18:41.760 --> 18:43.595
I should get to cash in on that.

18:43.678 --> 18:45.138
There's no way he'll go for this.

18:45.221 --> 18:48.892
Then there's no reason
for me to be your eyes and ears.

18:52.812 --> 18:54.981
I'll get back to you.

18:55.065 --> 18:56.941
During business hours.

19:15.418 --> 19:18.505
No, Mark, we ran it in the White
House screening room and I swear to God,

19:18.588 --> 19:21.466
when those jets crashed
into one of our Seawolf subs,

19:21.549 --> 19:24.344
the Joint Chiefs screamed.

19:24.427 --> 19:26.868
No, they didn't want you to use it
and certainly not for free.

19:26.888 --> 19:28.515
David, I'm not just
asking you for money,

19:28.598 --> 19:30.767
I'm asking you to be one
of my campaign chairmen.

19:30.850 --> 19:33.251
That buys you a lot more
than a night in the Lincoln Bedroom.

19:35.480 --> 19:37.649
Claire Underwood for Senator Hylbrook.

19:37.732 --> 19:40.568
I agree. We can never rely solely
upon Security Counsel support.

19:40.652 --> 19:42.070
Scott, we're 18 months out.

19:42.153 --> 19:43.753
Now, if you wanna be
on the ground floor,

19:43.780 --> 19:45.532
you got to shit or get off the pot.

19:45.615 --> 19:48.284
The key is to provide leadership,
to lead by example.

19:48.368 --> 19:52.080
I was hoping we could
hit Maidstone for a quick eighteen.

19:52.163 --> 19:54.124
No, I'm a terrible golfer.

19:54.207 --> 19:56.584
Exactly, you'd have the pleasure
of beating a president.

19:56.668 --> 19:58.211
Now wouldn't that be
a good cocktail story?

19:58.294 --> 20:01.131
I've spoken to almost every Republican
in your committee, sir.

20:01.965 --> 20:03.842
Yes, they're taking their cue from you.

20:06.469 --> 20:08.763
Is there another number
where I can reach him?

20:08.847 --> 20:11.141
It's important
that we speak this evening.

20:12.642 --> 20:15.270
Yes, anytime, no matter how late.

20:15.854 --> 20:18.022
A little faith, Tom.
That's all I'm asking.

20:18.106 --> 20:22.485
Oh, yes! I know, I don't
like being called "ma'am" either.

20:22.569 --> 20:24.821
If I made every decision based
on what makes people feel good,

20:24.904 --> 20:26.489
I'd be a talk show host,
not the president.

20:26.573 --> 20:28.992
Well, I know Admiral Jennings
is a good friend of yours,

20:29.075 --> 20:31.369
- I can call him personally.
- Don't let fear drive you.

20:31.452 --> 20:33.079
That's not how you
run your business, is it?

20:33.163 --> 20:35.957
I know you've been in my shoes,
and sound bites are not who we are.

20:36.040 --> 20:39.294
- Penny-wise and pound-foolish.
- I'm so sorry, Senator, did I wake you?

20:39.377 --> 20:42.130
Yes, no, I'll try back again tomorrow.

20:42.213 --> 20:44.048
I can't fault you
for being shortsighted.

20:44.132 --> 20:47.093
I hope you won't fault me
for having a long memory.

20:47.177 --> 20:48.303
Good night!

20:52.223 --> 20:55.393
I'm waking people up now.
I'll start again in the morning.

20:57.437 --> 21:00.565
- How's it looking?
- I had to flip a coin? I don't know.

21:01.441 --> 21:04.235
- You?
- Not a single backer yet.

21:04.319 --> 21:06.404
- Not one?
- California's still awake.

21:06.487 --> 21:08.156
Maybe I'll have better luck out west.

21:08.239 --> 21:10.450
I'm going for a run.
I need to do something.

21:10.533 --> 21:12.202
- It's late.
- Well, I'm too restless.

21:12.285 --> 21:15.622
Well, I'll be here,
singing for my supper.

21:21.878 --> 21:24.923
It's humiliating to have to beg
from some kid who was on Facebook

21:25.006 --> 21:27.133
before his testicles descended,
but that's...

21:27.217 --> 21:30.178
Derrick, Francis Underwood.
Do you have a few minutes?

21:32.430 --> 21:34.307
I'll be running along the Mall tonight.

21:34.390 --> 21:36.017
That requires a full detail.

21:36.100 --> 21:37.894
How soon can you be ready?

21:37.977 --> 21:39.812
We'd far prefer you ran on the track.

21:39.896 --> 21:41.856
I'll be running along the Mall.

21:41.940 --> 21:45.068
Yes, ma'am. We're going to need
the First Lady's detail, ASAP.

21:48.571 --> 21:50.949
- This is off the record.
- Agreed.

21:51.866 --> 21:55.828
You've called my office every day for
the last six months with one question.

21:55.912 --> 21:58.164
I call everyone in the leadership.

21:58.248 --> 22:00.541
I get the same non-answer
from all of you:

22:00.625 --> 22:02.418
"Frank Underwood is our president..."

22:02.502 --> 22:04.712
He has our undivided support.

22:04.796 --> 22:07.715
Birch slipped up once. He said
"unwavering" instead of "undivided."

22:07.799 --> 22:10.301
I wanted to drug-test him.

22:10.385 --> 22:13.388
There was a meeting this morning
in the White House.

22:13.471 --> 22:15.473
I was there on Pebble Beach
when you came out.

22:15.556 --> 22:17.558
It lasted four and a half minutes.

22:17.642 --> 22:20.645
- You were in there for an hour.
- We were inside for an hour.

22:20.728 --> 22:23.064
Doesn't mean the meeting
lasted that long.

22:23.147 --> 22:24.983
What happened? Why so short?

22:28.152 --> 22:30.113
You're the Pulitzer finalist.

22:30.196 --> 22:31.781
America Works?

22:32.991 --> 22:35.243
Is that why the president went
to the Capitol this afternoon?

22:35.326 --> 22:37.495
No one from the White House would say.

22:42.041 --> 22:43.918
Have a good night.

22:46.421 --> 22:48.798
You chose me.
What's your play?

22:48.881 --> 22:51.843
When you write about presidents,
people pay attention.

24:40.243 --> 24:41.911
Oh...

24:48.126 --> 24:50.128
Oh!

24:51.003 --> 24:52.839
Ah...

25:06.811 --> 25:08.771
It'll come down to the wire.

25:08.855 --> 25:11.983
I'm confident, but I don't
want to leave anything to chance.

25:13.109 --> 25:17.530
Well, according to Erikson,
I have 47 votes as of this morning.

25:18.656 --> 25:20.491
Well, I know, Senator,
but that's not enough.

25:20.575 --> 25:22.034
I need yours.

25:31.878 --> 25:36.007
I have every intention
of running for president.

25:36.090 --> 25:37.967
I need to know you two are with me.

25:38.050 --> 25:40.553
If you have any doubts,
now's the time to let me know.

25:49.020 --> 25:51.355
Nancy, wipe the schedule clean.

25:51.439 --> 25:53.608
Yes, everything.

25:53.691 --> 25:55.902
We don't leave this office
until we have a plan.

25:58.321 --> 26:01.741
Ma'am? The Easter Egg Roll
we were scheduled for?

26:01.824 --> 26:03.284
- Right.
- If this is a bad time...

26:03.367 --> 26:05.369
No, that's fine.
Please, come in.

26:06.245 --> 26:07.246
Hello?

26:07.330 --> 26:10.041
Yes... Claire Underwood.
He's expecting my call.

26:11.834 --> 26:13.586
Hi, Sheila.
They're beautiful.

26:13.669 --> 26:16.380
Would you mind setting them up, please?
I have a couple more calls to make.

26:16.464 --> 26:21.636
Hello, Senator.
Yes, I'm well. How are you?

26:23.179 --> 26:26.015
The nomination of Claire Underwood,
of Washington DC,

26:26.098 --> 26:30.436
to be the Representative of the United
States of America to the United Nations.

26:30.519 --> 26:34.273
Yeas and nays have been ordered
and the clerk will call the roll.

26:34.357 --> 26:36.234
- Mr. Abner.
- Yea.

26:37.193 --> 26:38.986
Mr. Braun.

26:39.737 --> 26:41.155
Mr. Bray.

26:42.031 --> 26:45.201
- This one's a little too pink.
- Girls like pink.

26:45.284 --> 26:47.662
This is more than pink.
It's neon.

26:48.537 --> 26:50.915
- Uh, I'm choosing four?
- Yes, ma'am.

26:50.998 --> 26:53.751
- Willa?
- Up by two: 48 to 46.

26:53.834 --> 26:55.920
- Ma'am, we can finish up later.
- No.

26:56.003 --> 26:58.297
- Uh, what's next?
- The commemoratives.

26:58.381 --> 27:00.007
These are really special.

27:00.091 --> 27:01.467
A black egg?

27:01.550 --> 27:04.303
- Yes, with patriotic tipping.
- It's still a black egg.

27:04.387 --> 27:06.764
Engraved with POTUS
and FLOTUS signatures.

27:06.847 --> 27:09.767
Ma'am? Final tally: 52 to 48.

27:09.850 --> 27:11.227
Against.

27:18.317 --> 27:20.278
- The press?
- In the briefing room.

27:22.655 --> 27:25.116
I'll just be a few minutes.
Would you mind waiting?

27:25.199 --> 27:26.951
Not at all, ma'am.

27:37.545 --> 27:38.629
Hey.

27:39.380 --> 27:40.798
I just heard.

27:42.008 --> 27:44.135
I'm so sorry.

27:44.218 --> 27:45.553
The press is waiting.

27:45.636 --> 27:47.138
Well, they can wait.

27:47.221 --> 27:50.725
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No. I just want to get it over with.

27:52.935 --> 27:55.521
Claire. You...

28:04.280 --> 28:07.783
Good morning.
Naturally, I'm disappointed

28:07.867 --> 28:11.662
that the Senate did not confirm
my nomination today.

28:11.746 --> 28:15.041
But I'm very grateful to have been
afforded the opportunity.

28:15.124 --> 28:17.418
I'd be remiss
if I did not thank my husband

28:17.501 --> 28:20.296
for all the faith and trust
he placed in me.

28:20.379 --> 28:23.341
He's always supported me
in achieving my goals.

28:24.216 --> 28:28.262
I look forward to continued service
as First Lady.

28:29.013 --> 28:31.140
Thank you.

28:45.071 --> 28:49.033
Um, let's go with the...
green, the blue, and the cream.

28:49.116 --> 28:52.119
And for the rare one?
The Golden Ticket, so to speak?

28:53.287 --> 28:56.123
Red. That one's beautiful.

28:56.207 --> 28:58.334
Thank you.
Excuse me, please?

29:22.525 --> 29:24.360
You ever try to do this?

29:25.820 --> 29:27.238
Balance an egg?

29:29.573 --> 29:31.367
We used to do this as kids.

29:40.251 --> 29:43.379
You can't change
the laws of physics, can you?

29:56.600 --> 29:59.895
I was wrong. It's too hard.

29:59.979 --> 30:01.313
Sir?

30:01.397 --> 30:03.733
Fighting the leadership, raising money.

30:03.816 --> 30:06.485
We can't get them to do
what they're dead set against doing.

30:06.569 --> 30:09.864
We'd need six months
just to get them back to square one.

30:20.249 --> 30:22.793
We have to reverse our thinking.

30:26.589 --> 30:31.135
When the wind's blowing at gale force,
there's no point in sailing against it.

30:34.013 --> 30:36.098
What do you have in mind?

31:05.294 --> 31:07.338
The White House
Counsel's office, please.

31:07.421 --> 31:10.216
I don't care about their schedules.
If not today, tomorrow morning.

31:10.299 --> 31:11.467
Should I invite Jackie, too?

31:11.550 --> 31:13.177
Well, she qualifies as leadership.

31:13.260 --> 31:15.513
- What about her ask?
- Stall her for now.

31:15.596 --> 31:17.515
Let's see how the meeting goes.

31:17.598 --> 31:19.683
I want you to write the speech,
every word.

31:19.767 --> 31:21.185
- Yes, sir.
- And no leaks.

31:21.268 --> 31:23.687
You'll have a draft in three hours.

31:23.771 --> 31:27.691
And, sir... Doug emailed me
a lobbying strategy for AmWorks.

31:27.775 --> 31:29.735
- Do you want to look at it?
- Of his own accord?

31:29.819 --> 31:31.739
- You didn't tell him?
- No, I didn't say a word.

31:31.779 --> 31:33.779
It must be what he gathered
from watching the news.

31:33.781 --> 31:36.367
- How is he?
- Uh, Doug seems fine.

31:36.450 --> 31:38.702
I've been calling him, like you asked.

31:38.786 --> 31:41.038
- But he seems all right?
- Well, he tells me things are good,

31:41.121 --> 31:43.999
although I don't think
he'd admit it if they weren't.

31:44.083 --> 31:46.669
Why don't you stop by
from time to time, since I can't.

31:46.752 --> 31:48.212
- See him in person.
- Yes, sir.

31:48.295 --> 31:49.797
And send me his email.

32:00.057 --> 32:01.725
Claire?

32:05.688 --> 32:08.107
I'll be in my study if you need me.

32:14.071 --> 32:16.740
What're you working on?

32:16.824 --> 32:19.368
- Brought you a coffee.
- My savior.

32:19.451 --> 32:21.370
The leadership meeting
yesterday morning.

32:21.453 --> 32:23.455
It lasted four and a half minutes.

32:23.539 --> 32:24.707
Where'd you hear that?

32:24.790 --> 32:27.960
That's not long enough
to reject a major domestic agenda.

32:28.043 --> 32:30.588
I wasn't in the meeting.
I don't know how long it lasted.

32:30.671 --> 32:33.799
- Something went down.
- If you say so.

32:33.883 --> 32:35.718
Uh, I didn't hear anything about it.

32:35.801 --> 32:37.928
Could've been the president
was called away.

32:38.012 --> 32:41.390
- That happens all the time.
- Not this time.

32:41.473 --> 32:42.892
How do you know?

32:42.975 --> 32:45.644
Clearly, I have a source
that knows more than you.

32:45.728 --> 32:49.148
Most sources do.
At least they pretend they do.

32:50.524 --> 32:52.234
Thanks for the coffee.

32:53.193 --> 32:56.697
Two sugars next time.
I'll remember that.

33:04.038 --> 33:05.664
You talked to Ayla Sayyad.

33:05.748 --> 33:08.500
I can either be an asset or a liability.

33:08.584 --> 33:10.252
You think this puts you
on the ticket now?

33:10.336 --> 33:11.754
Not if you tell him.

33:11.837 --> 33:14.173
But the smart move would
be to advocate on my behalf.

33:14.256 --> 33:15.591
Don't strong-arm me, Jackie.

33:15.674 --> 33:17.955
You're the man in the middle.
Who else would I strong-arm?

33:17.968 --> 33:19.803
I want to be on your team, Remy.

33:19.887 --> 33:22.348
We do well when we're on the same team.

33:26.769 --> 33:28.354
You have more calls?

33:29.146 --> 33:32.066
No. I'm done.

33:34.026 --> 33:36.195
- Who spoke to her?
- I have no idea, sir.

33:36.278 --> 33:38.739
- Well, it's your job to know.
- Things are moving fast.

33:38.822 --> 33:40.240
I'm just trying to stay ahead of them.

33:40.324 --> 33:42.576
Well, we need to move faster.
Has the meeting been set?

33:42.660 --> 33:45.162
Eight a.m. tomorrow.
I just heard back from Birch's office.

33:45.245 --> 33:47.206
Good. Let's have the networks
ready to go live by nine.

33:47.289 --> 33:50.292
One more thing. Jackie.

33:50.376 --> 33:52.544
I think you should decide
sooner rather than later.

33:52.628 --> 33:54.755
If we're gonna go this route,
we need every ally we can get.

33:54.838 --> 33:56.757
After the meeting. We'll discuss then.

34:09.728 --> 34:10.896
You've emerged.

34:12.563 --> 34:13.690
Hi.

34:14.858 --> 34:16.860
I took a nap.
Last night was...

34:16.944 --> 34:18.570
I didn't get much sleep.

34:18.654 --> 34:20.114
Me, neither.

34:21.407 --> 34:23.242
We're gonna find something for you.

34:23.324 --> 34:27.621
Some other position, or something
as First Lady, I promise.

34:28.371 --> 34:29.706
I know.

34:30.873 --> 34:33.127
- What are you doing up?
- I've got to go over my speech.

34:33.210 --> 34:35.254
It's happening tomorrow night.

34:35.337 --> 34:37.089
What speech?

34:48.766 --> 34:50.561
It's premature, isn't it?

34:50.643 --> 34:52.187
Read on.

35:35.647 --> 35:37.066
Yes?

35:38.734 --> 35:40.277
Yes.

35:44.782 --> 35:46.325
Thank you. Please.

35:52.206 --> 35:55.918
I put a great deal of thought
into what you've all asked of me.

35:56.001 --> 35:59.171
I challenged myself
to keep an open mind.

35:59.254 --> 36:03.550
And my decision is:
I will not run for president.

36:03.634 --> 36:07.304
Look, they're thinking
it's too good to be true, and it is.

36:07.387 --> 36:09.014
I lied in the Oval Office before.

36:09.098 --> 36:10.682
I didn't want to take
the chance this time.

36:10.766 --> 36:12.559
It's too big a deal to jinx myself.

36:13.143 --> 36:16.855
At nine o'clock tonight, I will
announce to the nation my decision.

36:16.939 --> 36:18.065
What's the catch?

36:19.650 --> 36:24.029
I wanted us to meet here
in this room for a reason.

36:24.113 --> 36:25.697
For the past five months,

36:25.781 --> 36:29.368
my team has sat at this very table,
developing America Works.

36:29.451 --> 36:31.453
You know how much
the program means to me,

36:31.537 --> 36:33.017
and I want it to mean as much to you.

36:33.038 --> 36:36.208
- So there is a catch.
- No, an opportunity.

36:36.291 --> 36:37.960
Look, we all know the...

36:39.211 --> 36:41.672
All right, let's just say for...
argument's sake

36:41.755 --> 36:45.926
that this table here represents
the next year and a half, all right?

36:46.009 --> 36:47.970
So, this is us right now.

36:48.053 --> 36:50.180
And down there at the end,
that's the election.

36:50.264 --> 36:54.101
Now, if I did run, I'd spend
the next few months fundraising.

36:54.184 --> 36:57.521
And then somewhere around here,
I'd formally announce.

36:57.604 --> 37:00.649
And then even if I did win the nomination,
say, somewhere around here,

37:00.732 --> 37:04.862
I'd start to have to face off with
a Republican challenger, probably Mendoza.

37:04.945 --> 37:06.947
And then things would get brutal.

37:07.030 --> 37:09.366
Daily, daily events.

37:09.449 --> 37:10.951
Fending off attacks.

37:11.034 --> 37:12.619
Launching my own.

37:12.703 --> 37:15.372
And... you're right.

37:15.455 --> 37:17.082
In the end...

37:17.166 --> 37:19.334
...I'd probably lose.

37:19.418 --> 37:23.922
I would spend 18 months campaigning,

37:24.006 --> 37:27.092
which would leave no time to govern.

37:28.844 --> 37:31.972
But you have opened my eyes.

37:32.055 --> 37:34.308
I feel liberated.

37:34.391 --> 37:38.812
I want to spend these next 18 months
dedicated to one thing:

37:38.896 --> 37:41.815
America Works.
But I need your help to do it.

37:41.899 --> 37:45.027
You're putting an awfully big price tag
on this, Mr. President.

37:45.110 --> 37:47.404
No, you've put an awfully big
price tag on this.

37:47.487 --> 37:51.867
You're asking me to be a placeholder
for 18 months and I intend to govern.

37:51.950 --> 37:54.161
And if America Works succeeds,

37:54.244 --> 37:57.706
then whoever you choose to run in 2016
not only has the backing

37:57.789 --> 38:01.001
of a united party,
but a formidable legacy.

38:01.084 --> 38:04.796
But Social Security?
Benefits. Entitlements.

38:04.880 --> 38:08.133
We don't want to present a fresh face
only to shoot ourselves in the foot.

38:08.217 --> 38:10.594
Then let's not pretend
to unite the party,

38:10.677 --> 38:13.347
let's unite the party
behind this legislation.

38:13.430 --> 38:15.057
We'll never get it past the Republicans.

38:15.140 --> 38:16.934
We are not here to negotiate!

38:17.017 --> 38:20.437
You want forward-thinking, Bob?
Then think forward.

38:20.520 --> 38:23.941
You want a fresh face for 2016?
You wanna work together?

38:24.024 --> 38:26.318
Then present my program to Congress.

38:26.401 --> 38:28.612
And if it dies there, so be it.

38:28.695 --> 38:32.407
But I want us to fucking try!

38:40.832 --> 38:43.710
I am prepared to vacate this chair.

38:44.419 --> 38:46.797
Meet me halfway.

38:46.880 --> 38:48.215
Any moment now,

38:48.298 --> 38:51.051
the president will be addressing
the nation live from the East Room.

38:51.134 --> 38:54.680
The White House has remained silent on
the subject of the president's speech,

38:54.763 --> 38:58.350
but sources in Congress say it
will focus on the jobs initiative

38:58.433 --> 39:00.686
he's been planning
to unveil for several months.

39:00.769 --> 39:02.896
The program, dubbed America Works,

39:02.980 --> 39:06.984
was developed in secret. Any details
are the by-product of speculation,

39:07.067 --> 39:09.361
but sources suggest
it will have elements

39:09.444 --> 39:11.613
from both liberal
and conservative agendas.

39:11.697 --> 39:15.450
What remains to be seen is whether
a Republican-controlled Congress

39:15.534 --> 39:17.869
will cooperate in pushing
the program forward.

39:17.953 --> 39:21.707
The White House has faced
significant opposition from the GOP

39:21.790 --> 39:23.750
since Congress began
its current session,

39:23.834 --> 39:27.379
and many speculate that the president's
liberal application of veto power

39:27.462 --> 39:29.631
may leave congressional
leaders disinclined

39:29.715 --> 39:31.508
to support this new jobs program.

39:31.591 --> 39:35.012
Additionally, many Democratic
supporters of President Underwood,

39:35.095 --> 39:39.474
from his days as House Majority Whip,
were voted out of office in November,

39:39.558 --> 39:42.602
diminishing his personal influence
over legislators.

39:43.812 --> 39:46.398
Low approval ratings
are a continuing concern

39:46.481 --> 39:48.108
for the Underwood administration.

39:48.191 --> 39:51.695
And congressional sources suggest
the choice to tackle unemployment

39:51.778 --> 39:55.157
may be part of a campaign strategy
for 2016.

39:56.450 --> 40:00.120
Recent polls indicate that less than one
third of all Americans say they would

40:00.203 --> 40:02.122
consider voting for
President Underwood...

40:18.597 --> 40:22.142
...job growth has remained a popular
platform in national elections,

40:22.225 --> 40:25.604
and if today's announcement
is received well,

40:25.687 --> 40:29.816
President Underwood's campaign
certainly has an opportunity to benefit.

40:33.779 --> 40:35.072
Thank you.

40:35.155 --> 40:37.282
Sir, we're ready for you
in five seconds.

40:43.455 --> 40:44.873
Good evening.

40:44.956 --> 40:48.085
For too long, we in Washington
have been lying to you.

40:48.168 --> 40:53.090
We say we're here to serve you,
when in fact, we're serving ourselves.

40:53.173 --> 40:57.761
And why? We are driven
by our own desire to get reelected.

40:57.844 --> 41:02.265
Our need to stay in power
eclipses our duty to govern.

41:02.349 --> 41:04.643
That ends tonight.

41:04.726 --> 41:08.522
Tonight, I give you the truth.

41:08.605 --> 41:13.902
And the truth is this:
The American dream has failed you.

41:13.985 --> 41:18.698
Work hard? Play by the rules?
You aren't guaranteed success.

41:18.782 --> 41:22.327
Your children will not have
a better life than you did.

41:22.411 --> 41:27.499
Ten million of you can't even get a job,
even though you desperately want one.

41:27.582 --> 41:32.045
We've been crippled
by Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,

41:32.129 --> 41:35.006
by welfare, by entitlements.

41:35.090 --> 41:39.845
And that is the root
of the problem: entitlements.

41:39.928 --> 41:45.308
Let me be clear.
You are entitled to nothing.

41:46.685 --> 41:51.773
You are entitled to nothing.

41:51.857 --> 41:55.026
America was built
on the spirit of industry.

41:55.110 --> 41:58.530
You build your future.
It isn't handed to you.

41:58.613 --> 42:00.282
And the problem with Washington

42:00.365 --> 42:03.118
is that we haven't given you
the tools to build it.

42:03.201 --> 42:08.874
The only way for us to serve you is
to give you the means to serve yourselves.

42:08.957 --> 42:11.751
Well, that's exactly
what I intend to do.

42:11.835 --> 42:14.129
Not handouts. Jobs.

42:14.212 --> 42:17.466
Real paying jobs.

42:17.549 --> 42:19.968
In the next few weeks,
the Democratic leadership

42:20.051 --> 42:23.263
will introduce a program
called "America Works."

42:23.346 --> 42:25.599
Its goal is simple:

42:25.682 --> 42:29.853
to put the ten million Americans
who are unemployed to work.

42:29.936 --> 42:34.483
All of them.
If you want a job, you get one.

42:34.566 --> 42:38.153
The cost
is five hundred billion dollars.

42:38.236 --> 42:39.988
Now, that's a lot of money.

42:40.071 --> 42:43.074
To pay for it, we'll need
to rethink Social Security,

42:43.158 --> 42:46.161
healthcare and benefits
from the ground up.

42:46.244 --> 42:49.956
We can't maintain
the welfare state as we know it.

42:50.749 --> 42:53.084
Now, that's not a popular thing to say.

42:53.168 --> 42:56.338
Anyone running for office
wouldn't dare utter those words.

42:56.421 --> 42:58.757
Every advisor and consultant
and staff member

42:58.840 --> 43:01.885
would beg a presidential candidate
not to say them.

43:01.968 --> 43:04.387
But I can say them.

43:04.471 --> 43:09.726
Because I will not be seeking
the Democratic nomination in 2016.

43:12.521 --> 43:14.814
Candidates are cautious.

43:14.898 --> 43:17.776
They must equivocate.
They dodge and tiptoe.

43:17.859 --> 43:22.280
But I'd rather leave this office having
accomplished something of value

43:22.364 --> 43:26.409
than secure another four years
having done nothing at all.

43:27.327 --> 43:30.956
Franklin Delano Roosevelt
ushered in an era of hope and progress

43:31.039 --> 43:33.166
when he proposed the New Deal.

43:33.250 --> 43:36.962
And at the time,
his reforms were considered radical.

43:37.045 --> 43:43.426
But he once said, "This country demands
bold, persistent experimentation.

43:43.510 --> 43:47.097
It is common sense
to take a method and try it.

43:47.180 --> 43:50.600
And if it fails,
admit it frankly and try another.

43:50.684 --> 43:54.020
But above all, try something."

43:54.104 --> 43:56.356
Roosevelt would have
understood better than anyone

43:56.439 --> 43:59.234
the necessity
for trying something different.

43:59.317 --> 44:01.945
The New Deal succeeded for many years,

44:02.028 --> 44:06.032
but we must now try something newer
before it fails us.

44:06.116 --> 44:11.538
If America Works succeeds,
we will reinvent the American dream.

44:11.621 --> 44:13.456
If we fail in our attempt,

44:13.540 --> 44:16.418
we will admit it frankly
and try another.

44:16.501 --> 44:21.590
But above all, we must try something.

44:21.673 --> 44:25.510
Thank you, and God Bless
the United States of America.

44:41.192 --> 44:42.652
Hey.

44:42.736 --> 44:44.112
It's two in the morning.

44:44.195 --> 44:46.281
Yeah, I just left the White House.

44:46.364 --> 44:48.158
The press conference,
phone calls, emails,

44:48.241 --> 44:49.743
the rest can wait until tomorrow.

44:49.826 --> 44:52.370
- Were you asleep?
- No.

44:53.872 --> 44:55.707
This is a cool place.

44:56.541 --> 44:58.001
How much is your rent?

44:59.919 --> 45:02.047
I thought you said AmWorks was on hold.

45:02.130 --> 45:04.007
Well, it was and then it wasn't.

45:04.674 --> 45:07.010
The leadership didn't want him to run.

45:07.093 --> 45:08.136
Who told you that?

45:08.219 --> 45:11.097
Nobody. But I figure it's the only
reason he'd make that speech.

45:11.181 --> 45:12.599
Hm...

45:12.682 --> 45:15.518
- He's still gonna run though, isn't he?
- He says he's not.

45:15.602 --> 45:18.188
I know him better
than you ever will, Seth.

45:18.271 --> 45:20.315
There's no way he doesn't run.

45:22.484 --> 45:26.279
Is that why you're here?
Because he needs my help now?

45:26.363 --> 45:29.949
No, I just... I wanted to check up
with you in person this time.

45:32.410 --> 45:35.330
- He asked you to.
- Yes.

45:37.165 --> 45:39.376
I did send him your email, though.

45:39.459 --> 45:42.295
- What did he say?
- I'm not sure if he's read it.

45:49.594 --> 45:51.805
You should probably get some sleep, huh?

45:53.014 --> 45:56.101
Big day for the press team tomorrow.

45:59.687 --> 46:01.856
You can report back. Alive and well.

46:03.608 --> 46:05.693
Is it okay if I stop by now and then?

46:05.777 --> 46:07.904
Do I have a choice?

46:07.987 --> 46:11.199
I don't, but I can't force you
to open the door.

46:12.826 --> 46:15.829
- Whatever you want.
- Thanks.

46:17.288 --> 46:18.915
I'll see you soon.

47:12.093 --> 47:13.678
Ms. Dunbar.

47:13.761 --> 47:14.762
Mr. President.

47:15.680 --> 47:18.099
I had a lot on my mind
when we last spoke.

47:18.183 --> 47:20.663
- The speech last night, it was...
- Yes, it was a big decision

47:20.727 --> 47:22.770
and I apologize if I was distracted.

47:22.854 --> 47:25.773
- Not at all, sir.
- So, the drone strike case.

47:25.857 --> 47:28.067
You've been pursuing
the State secrets defense.

47:28.151 --> 47:30.487
Yes, sir.

47:30.570 --> 47:34.240
- Heather... May I call you Heather?
- Please.

47:34.324 --> 47:36.284
The American people are sick of secrets.

47:36.367 --> 47:39.078
That's the point I was
trying to make last night.

47:39.162 --> 47:41.748
I promised the truth,
and now we're going to deliver.

47:41.831 --> 47:43.917
What truth is that, sir?

47:44.000 --> 47:46.336
A man had his legs blown off.
An American citizen.

47:46.419 --> 47:47.879
We're going to own up to that.

47:47.962 --> 47:50.590
We're going to admit that
the CIA conducted the drone strike

47:50.673 --> 47:53.968
- and explain the reasons why.
- That information is classified.

47:54.052 --> 47:57.889
Not anymore. You have my permission
to make the classified brief public.

47:59.224 --> 48:02.018
Sir, that is not a sound legal approach.

48:02.101 --> 48:04.646
- But it's what the country needs.
- We're not appealing to the country.

48:04.729 --> 48:06.898
- We're appealing to nine justices.
- Wrong.

48:06.981 --> 48:09.692
We're appealing to both
by taking responsibility.

48:09.776 --> 48:13.363
Yes, a man was maimed,
his family members were killed.

48:13.446 --> 48:17.075
But hundreds, perhaps thousands
of lives were saved as a result.

48:17.158 --> 48:18.826
I understand the emotional logic,

48:18.910 --> 48:21.120
- but we can't...
- You sat right there and told me

48:21.204 --> 48:24.666
- even Supreme Court justices have hearts.
- Yes, but...

48:24.749 --> 48:26.918
Far be it from me to tell you
how to do your job.

48:27.001 --> 48:29.045
I've never practiced law
a day in my life.

48:29.128 --> 48:31.172
But I have written them.

48:31.256 --> 48:35.176
And occupying this office,
I know what the country needs.

48:35.260 --> 48:36.719
It needs closure.

48:40.139 --> 48:42.433
Let me work on a new argument.

48:42.517 --> 48:45.061
- Thank you, Heather.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

48:52.569 --> 48:55.697
- Where do you want these, ma'am?
- Anywhere. Just not in here.

48:55.780 --> 48:57.198
Okay.

48:59.033 --> 49:01.244
- Scott?
- Yes?

49:01.327 --> 49:02.870
Here's a couple more.

49:33.234 --> 49:36.696
Hey. You want a peanut butter and jelly?

49:36.779 --> 49:38.364
No, thanks.

49:44.495 --> 49:46.331
Is everything all right?

49:50.543 --> 49:52.837
I want the UN job, Francis.

49:53.630 --> 49:57.342
The Senate goes home in two weeks.
I want a recess appointment.

49:57.425 --> 50:00.678
I prepared for it. I can do this.
And after it's all over,

50:00.762 --> 50:03.681
if I've done the job I know I can do,
I'll be positioned

50:03.765 --> 50:05.933
- for anything I want.
- Claire...

50:06.017 --> 50:07.644
Now, I checked
with the White House Counsel.

50:07.727 --> 50:11.564
There is precedent for a recess
appointment after a rejected nomination.

50:11.648 --> 50:13.358
Only once,
but you wouldn't be the first.

50:13.441 --> 50:15.526
And I know
you'll take a hit politically.

50:15.610 --> 50:17.737
And I know people
will think I don't deserve it.

50:17.820 --> 50:22.992
They'll have doubts in me.
But what if... this is as far as we get?

50:23.076 --> 50:25.870
What if it's all over in 18 months?

50:25.953 --> 50:29.290
I don't want to wait,
or settle for something else,

50:29.374 --> 50:32.502
- when I've put all this work into...
- Okay.

50:33.836 --> 50:35.338
I'll do it.

50:38.007 --> 50:40.760
- You sure you don't want half?
- I'm not hungry.

50:40.843 --> 50:42.428
I'll be in my study.
