Sorry I'm late, guys.
I was at that Joseph Gordon-Levitt movie.

00:38.163 --> 00:40.206
I wonder if I urinated on the floor,

00:40.290 --> 00:42.500
if it would make it
all the way down to the front.

00:47.422 --> 00:48.381
Hey!

00:48.465 --> 00:52.010
So how's our new drag race
machine thing looking?

00:52.093 --> 00:53.011
She's ready.

00:53.094 --> 00:54.554
No thanks to you.

00:54.637 --> 00:56.222
-I'll fire her up!

01:02.562 --> 01:03.646
-All right!
-Yeah!

01:03.730 --> 01:05.231
Go, Greased Lightning!

01:05.315 --> 01:07.567
With me at the wheel,
we're gonna win that race

01:07.650 --> 01:10.945
and raise thousands of dollars
for feline diabetes!

01:11.029 --> 01:12.197
You at the wheel?

01:12.280 --> 01:14.616
Oh-ho, you ain't driving, I'm driving.

01:14.699 --> 01:16.868
What do you know
about the sport of racing?

01:16.951 --> 01:18.745
I'm pretty sure I can handle it,

01:18.828 --> 01:22.665
seeing as I've been driving
since I was 29 years old.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.417
This is drag racing.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.127
Then I'll dress up like a woman.

01:28.421 --> 01:31.966
But I did all the work.
Built this car with parts from my yard.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.052
Hell, the wheels
are off my mother's house.

01:34.135 --> 01:36.805
Let's put it to a vote. I vote me.

01:36.888 --> 01:39.599
-Uh, Cleveland.
-I'd drive, but I'm grounded.

01:39.682 --> 01:42.310
Left a wet towel on the carpet.
So Cleveland.

01:42.393 --> 01:44.979
Hooray! I'm the driver!

01:45.063 --> 01:47.732
Damn it! A black guy
can't drive a race car.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.150
Driving a race car requires--

01:49.234 --> 01:52.612
Whoa, whoa, whoa, write it down,
and I'll tell you if you can say it.

01:53.696 --> 01:55.073
No, you can't say that.

01:57.659 --> 02:00.578
So, it's the bottom
of the eighth, and I'm in a rundown.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.872
I run toward third, then home,

02:02.956 --> 02:06.793
then third, then home,
third, home, third, home.

02:06.876 --> 02:08.837
This happens 42 times.

02:08.920 --> 02:11.214
-Wow!
-Unbe-freakin'-lievable.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.633
Coach McFall called it
the greatest rundown

02:13.716 --> 02:15.260
he'd ever seen in his life.

02:15.343 --> 02:19.180
You know, Cleveland,
I'd rather hear a dry fart from a wet dog

02:19.264 --> 02:21.432
than another one of your baseball stories.

02:21.516 --> 02:24.894
You're just jealous
because you never played a real sport.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.063
Oh, uh, uh, snack!

02:27.147 --> 02:29.899
-Baseball ain't a sport.
-Not a sport?

02:29.983 --> 02:34.487
You, sir, are an ignoramus,
and you wouldn't know a grand slam

02:34.571 --> 02:38.992
from an admittedly delicious
and horrifically salty Denny's meal.

02:39.075 --> 02:40.910
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah!

02:40.994 --> 02:43.371
-You think so?
-I know so!

02:43.454 --> 02:47.041
Why, you rootin', tootin',
I'll bet I could strike you out!

02:47.125 --> 02:49.961
Wha...? Strike me out?

02:50.044 --> 02:52.797
You heard me. Tomorrow at the field.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.007
You're on!

02:54.090 --> 02:57.594
I'll whiff you so bad,
they'll feel the breeze in Cooper County.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.387
That's very far away.

02:59.470 --> 03:03.808
Or maybe I'll hit a home run
that lands in Cartwright County.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.643
Wow, that's even farther.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.937
Okay, guys, closing time.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.478
Oh...

03:54.150 --> 03:55.652
Oh, man.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.821
This is going worse
than Paul Giamatti's last physical.

03:58.905 --> 04:02.617
Yeah, you're gonna want to get...
this replaced.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.288
Well, Gordo, good thing
we woke up here this morning.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.916
Otherwise we would have missed
this epic battle.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.251
You said it, Angus.

04:11.334 --> 04:14.712
Local bucktoothed disgrace
Lester Krinklesac has bet

04:14.796 --> 04:18.508
he can strike out former
Stoolbend High School baseball legend

04:18.591 --> 04:22.053
and current nonunion cable installer
Cleveland Brown.

04:26.683 --> 04:29.143
First Kendra, now this.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.062
Thanks a lot, beer.

04:31.145 --> 04:34.607
<i>Well, here we go.
Brown steps in and adjusts himself.</i>

04:34.691 --> 04:37.318
<i>Crotch arrangement
very important in baseball.</i>

04:37.402 --> 04:38.861
<i>You can't say that enough.</i>

04:38.945 --> 04:42.490
<i>Both players today going
with the left pant leg.</i>

04:52.000 --> 04:54.585
<i>And it looks like Krinklesac's ready.</i>

04:59.090 --> 05:01.217
Ball one!

05:01.301 --> 05:05.596
Somebody call the cops!
This man's trying to murder all the worms.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.891
-Oh...

05:10.852 --> 05:13.354
Ball!

05:13.438 --> 05:17.233
Great throw. Does your husband also pitch?

05:18.735 --> 05:20.611
Who am I, everybody?

05:23.156 --> 05:28.619
-He's Lester.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.371
Here, I'll give you this one.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.292
Ow! Doo-doo balls!

05:35.501 --> 05:36.502
Ball three!

05:37.628 --> 05:39.881
Oh, three and O already?

05:39.964 --> 05:41.758
I don't want to go back to work yet.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.093
Tell you what, I'll swing at anything.

05:47.597 --> 05:50.933
Strike!

05:51.017 --> 05:52.727
You call that a pitch?

05:52.810 --> 05:53.936
Here's a pitch.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.397
It's <i>I Am Legend</i> meets <i>Maid in Manhattan.</i>

05:56.481 --> 05:58.941
Put Ryan Reynolds in there
and call it a day.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.234
All right, let's go!

06:03.279 --> 06:04.781
<i>Foul ball!</i>

06:04.864 --> 06:06.532
Damn!

06:06.616 --> 06:10.703
Stee-two...!

06:10.787 --> 06:13.122
Oh, no, strike two!

06:13.206 --> 06:16.209
Hey, Lester,
they should call you Larry King's chair,

06:16.292 --> 06:17.377
'cause you stink!

06:17.460 --> 06:20.296
-Lester stinks!

06:20.380 --> 06:25.009
ALL Lester stinks!
Lester stinks! Lester stinks!

06:25.093 --> 06:28.888
-Lester stinks! Lester stinks!

06:28.971 --> 06:31.140
-Lester stinks!

06:31.224 --> 06:34.435
-Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
-Lester stinks!

06:34.519 --> 06:37.480
Lester stinks! Lester stinks!

06:37.563 --> 06:40.400
Move it, pudge! I'm taking over.

06:45.154 --> 06:46.531
Kendra, what are you doing?

06:46.614 --> 06:49.450
Lester, you can do this.

06:49.534 --> 06:53.204
Remember the winter we had
to survive on skunks?

06:53.287 --> 06:55.832
And we covered Ernie with skunk urine

06:55.915 --> 06:58.084
to attract skunks which you'd kill

06:58.167 --> 07:00.336
by throwing rocks at the skunks?

07:00.420 --> 07:03.548
And you killed those skunks
without hitting Ernie,

07:03.631 --> 07:07.093
because you knew if he was hurt
we'd lose our skunk bait?

07:07.176 --> 07:08.636
Vaguely.

07:09.011 --> 07:10.430
What's your point, big 'un?

07:10.513 --> 07:12.932
Well, the baseball is the rock,

07:13.015 --> 07:16.936
this mitt is the skunk
and Cleveland is Ernie.

07:17.019 --> 07:19.439
I don't know. I just don't--

07:19.522 --> 07:24.694
You do this,
and I'll let you suck my toes.

07:24.777 --> 07:27.905
A wide miss, Kendra. A wide miss.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.409
But I appreciate the sentiment.

07:31.742 --> 07:33.411
Now, I've got a job to do.

07:36.330 --> 07:39.667
Come on. Right down the middle.
It's tater time!

08:00.646 --> 08:02.064
Stee, three!

08:04.901 --> 08:08.946
<i>And down goes Brown!
Down goes Brown!</i>

08:09.030 --> 08:12.533
<i>I don't believe what I just saw!
Do you believe in miracles?</i>

08:12.617 --> 08:15.828
<i>Yes!
President Reagan has been shot!</i>

08:15.912 --> 08:19.874
<i>Soylent Green is people!</i> Fahrvergnügen!

08:21.083 --> 08:23.085
Kendra! Kendra!

08:23.169 --> 08:24.754
Lester!

08:29.634 --> 08:33.012
And there is no joy in Stoolbend.

08:33.429 --> 08:36.140
Mighty Cleveland has struck out.

08:52.448 --> 08:54.325
Stick with me, fellas, you'll learn a lot.

08:54.408 --> 08:56.285
Uh, Lester, you're in my seat.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.914
Not just about baseball,
but about politics, home remedies,

08:59.997 --> 09:01.999
the black experience
in the American South...

09:02.083 --> 09:05.002
I would take this one,
but your feet are on it.

09:05.086 --> 09:08.589
<i>Mad TV</i> sketches, rust,
living with obesity...

09:12.051 --> 09:13.803
There were no other chairs available,

09:13.886 --> 09:16.889
so as long as no one wants to play
Pac-Man...

09:17.306 --> 09:20.726
Well, looking forward to winning
that drag race for our team.

09:20.810 --> 09:24.480
Yeah, me, too, which is more relevant
since I'll be driving.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.440
Yeah, Cleveland, uh, we, uh, decided

09:26.524 --> 09:28.901
to, uh, make Lester the driver, since,

09:28.985 --> 09:30.611
uh, he, he, is, uh, you know,

09:31.112 --> 09:32.905
better than you at a baseball.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.782
What? Is this all just because I--?

09:34.865 --> 09:37.118
Hey! I want to play Ms. Pac-Man!

09:37.201 --> 09:40.246
Oh!

09:46.002 --> 09:48.170
Depressed.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.759
-Is something wrong, Cleveland?
-No.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.554
Yes.

09:56.637 --> 09:58.139
What is it, Cleveland?

09:58.222 --> 10:00.766
You know Lester and Tim and Holt?

10:00.850 --> 10:02.768
Yes, I know them.

10:02.852 --> 10:07.940
Ever since I struck out,
they don't think I'm cool.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.692
Oh, poor baby.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.527
Well, you don't need them.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.488
Maybe it's time to find yourself
some new friends.

10:14.572 --> 10:17.199
Fine, I'll go out and get drunk.

10:17.283 --> 10:20.369
You make dinner and put the kids to bed
and fold my laundry,

10:20.453 --> 10:23.372
and then take the bus to the bar
and drive me home.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.545
Hear ye, hear ye.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.964
We have a new friend joining us tonight.

10:32.048 --> 10:34.634
So let's all raise our glasses.

10:34.717 --> 10:37.303
I'm kidding.

10:37.386 --> 10:39.347
Drinking glasses!

10:39.430 --> 10:40.848
I'd like to propose a toast.

10:40.931 --> 10:42.516
Wish I had some butter.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.352
Not that kind of toast.

10:44.435 --> 10:46.937
To our new fourth Musketeer...

10:47.021 --> 10:49.440
Toledo Blue!

10:49.523 --> 10:51.651
Wait, wait, that's not right!

10:51.734 --> 10:55.488
Oh, here it is, Cleveland Brown!

10:58.616 --> 11:00.201
So, uh...

11:01.285 --> 11:04.330
Uh, so, you guys watching
some football this weekend?

11:04.413 --> 11:06.082
I do not own a television.

11:06.165 --> 11:10.002
However, I do rent one every four years
for the Winter Olympics.

11:10.086 --> 11:13.089
-Oh.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.591
Aw, they ordered a pizza to the bar?

11:15.675 --> 11:17.385
That's so cool.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.512
Did somebody say "pizza?"

11:19.595 --> 11:21.430
That's Italian!

11:21.972 --> 11:24.266
<i>♪ When the... ♪</i>

11:24.350 --> 11:27.353
<i>♪ Moon hits your eye
like a big pizza pie ♪</i>

11:27.436 --> 11:29.522
<i>♪ That's amore ♪</i>

11:29.605 --> 11:31.732
Yeah, yeah, <i>amore,</i> yeah.

11:31.816 --> 11:34.735
Oh, ho, ho. This has been the worst
40 minutes of my life.

11:45.121 --> 11:48.124
If you've come for the urine jars,
they're under the bed.

11:48.207 --> 11:51.836
No, Mom just wanted to see
if you're coming down for dinner tonight.

11:51.919 --> 11:53.087
Dinner?

11:53.170 --> 11:57.508
What use is food for a man
whose life has no meaning?

11:57.591 --> 11:59.760
So you're not coming down to dinner.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.262
Will you sign my report card?

12:01.345 --> 12:03.180
Well, let's see how you did.

12:03.723 --> 12:07.435
A, A-minus, A, A, A-minu...

12:07.518 --> 12:08.811
Three tardies?

12:08.894 --> 12:11.021
No, I will not sign this!

12:11.522 --> 12:13.858
If you're going downstairs,
take a urine jar--

12:13.941 --> 12:16.569
Ah, ah, ah, she's gone.

12:16.652 --> 12:17.862
I got it, I got it!

12:18.362 --> 12:22.575
Wee, wee, wee, wee, all the way home!

12:24.994 --> 12:29.498
Huh, that's just the kind of thing
that usually cheers me up, too.

12:31.792 --> 12:34.587
<i>We now return
to Quinton "Rampage" Jackson</i>

12:34.670 --> 12:39.133
<i>and Michael Cera in</i> Reparations.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.136
Go, go, go!

12:43.429 --> 12:44.930
Um, Kunta, is it?

12:45.139 --> 12:48.017
Okay, Kunta, um, it's no biggie,

12:48.100 --> 12:50.186
but I made you a mix tape
for the ride, so--

12:50.269 --> 12:51.854
-Shut up, Quirky.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.315
I'm taking my people back to Africa.

12:54.398 --> 12:56.567
Back to our roots.

12:57.735 --> 13:00.321
My name is Kunta Kinte 9,000!

13:00.404 --> 13:04.742
-And you can Kunta kiss my ass!

13:11.749 --> 13:14.752
Roots! That's it! Donna!

13:14.835 --> 13:17.546
No time for the stairs!
I'll take the dumbwaiter!

13:20.883 --> 13:22.468
Donna! Donna!

13:22.551 --> 13:25.596
At least the jackass
is out of bed.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.057
Donna, are you sitting down?

13:28.140 --> 13:30.351
Cleveland, I'm standing in front of you.

13:30.434 --> 13:32.436
Good, you'll want to be standing for this.

13:33.062 --> 13:35.314
Oh, are we done acting like a child?

13:35.397 --> 13:38.776
Because I've figured out
how to get my mojo back!

13:38.859 --> 13:43.364
I need to reconnect to my roots
by going to Africa!

13:44.198 --> 13:45.324
Well, you know what?

13:45.407 --> 13:48.619
I actually think that's a great idea
for all of us.

13:48.702 --> 13:51.914
Oh, okay, yeah, sure,
everybody should come.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.834
Even the kids? I mean, of course the kids.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.919
We'll make it a family trip.

13:57.127 --> 14:01.549
Pack up the urine jars!
The Browns are going to Africa!

14:02.383 --> 14:04.093
-Yay!
-All right!

14:07.930 --> 14:10.933
It's always been a dream of mine
to go to Africa.

14:11.016 --> 14:13.060
I can't thank you enough, Brown.

14:13.143 --> 14:15.855
I hope you find
what you're looking for, man.

14:15.938 --> 14:19.191
Thank you.
Would you like to hear some of my poetry?

14:19.775 --> 14:21.652
Africa, Africa.

14:21.735 --> 14:23.654
Bring me some laugh-rica.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.531
Gilded stone of yore,

14:25.614 --> 14:29.034
bequeath unto me
your vast swaths of being.

14:29.285 --> 14:32.997
I, like an Okapi, run back to the womb.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.665
Doom. Gloom.

14:35.082 --> 14:37.126
Boom. Boom. Boom.

14:37.585 --> 14:38.669
Silence.

14:38.919 --> 14:41.171
And all is night.

14:41.589 --> 14:42.798
May I have that?

14:44.550 --> 14:46.886
-My odes!

14:46.969 --> 14:48.220
I'm gonna take a nap.

14:51.473 --> 14:54.602
Junior, you're gonna learn
about your heritage, too.

14:54.685 --> 14:57.354
Did you know that our ancestors
came from Africa?

14:57.438 --> 14:59.315
No, I thought we were Scottish.

14:59.398 --> 15:02.359
The hell's wrong with you, Dad? I'm 14.

15:02.610 --> 15:05.654
PILOT <i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

15:05.738 --> 15:07.698
<i>"Captain." Sounds weird.</i>

15:07.781 --> 15:09.867
<i>Last week I was a baggage handler.</i>

15:09.950 --> 15:12.286
<i>Anyway, please fasten your
seat belts as we begin</i>

15:12.369 --> 15:15.915
<i>our initial descent for our layover
in Hawaii.</i>

15:15.998 --> 15:19.543
<i>If anybody wants to do peyote buttons,
meet me at baggage claim.</i>

15:19.627 --> 15:21.962
<i>I'm going to see my guy.</i>

15:32.806 --> 15:34.350
This place is beautiful!

15:34.433 --> 15:36.894
Screw Africa. Let's just stay here!

15:36.977 --> 15:39.480
What about getting in touch
with our heritage?

15:39.563 --> 15:42.566
Pork our heritage!
This place has mai tais!

15:42.650 --> 15:45.235
Besides, Africa isn't going anywhere.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.279
And Hawaii's important, too.

15:47.363 --> 15:51.617
The island provides puka shell necklaces
for sunburned idiots all over the world.

15:51.700 --> 15:54.912
True. But Rallo was so excited
to go to Africa.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.538
What are we supposed to tell him?

15:58.916 --> 16:01.835
Welcome to Africa!

16:05.547 --> 16:06.966
This is Africa?

16:07.049 --> 16:11.136
Yup, this is Africa. Let's go sightseeing!

16:21.730 --> 16:26.235
<i>♪ It's gonna take a lot
to drag me away from you ♪</i>

16:26.860 --> 16:31.949
<i>♪ There's nothing that a hundred men
or more could ever do ♪</i>

16:32.032 --> 16:37.162
<i>♪ I bless the rains down in Africa ♪</i>

16:37.246 --> 16:43.961
<i>♪ Gonna take some time to do the things
we never have ♪</i>

16:55.681 --> 16:57.057
What a week, Donna.

16:57.141 --> 16:59.018
Thank God for credit cards.

16:59.101 --> 17:02.229
Why did I care so much
about that stupid strikeout?

17:02.312 --> 17:05.482
Remember that? Lester struck me out?
We had that bet and everything?

17:05.566 --> 17:07.151
Funny umpire and whatnot?

17:07.443 --> 17:09.236
That stuff's not important.

17:09.319 --> 17:13.032
All it takes to make me happy
is an oceanfront infinity pool

17:13.115 --> 17:14.700
with a swim-up bar.

17:14.783 --> 17:16.869
You know, the simple things.

17:16.952 --> 17:18.078
Well--

17:19.121 --> 17:20.122
You all right?

17:20.831 --> 17:23.959
There's so much in my life
I was taking for granted.

17:24.043 --> 17:27.004
-My wife, two great kids--
-Three.

17:27.087 --> 17:29.298
Yeah. This is what I needed.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.300
No, wait. There she is.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.510
This is what I needed.

17:33.594 --> 17:37.181
Oh, it's good to see you
back to yourself again.

17:37.264 --> 17:38.640
-What's that?
-I said, it's good

17:38.724 --> 17:40.476
to see you back to yourself again.

17:40.559 --> 17:41.810
Oh, yeah.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.646
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.565
And I love Africa.

17:46.648 --> 17:48.817
Thought there'd be
more black people, though.

17:51.445 --> 17:52.946
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
<i>We're now landing at</i>

17:53.030 --> 17:54.990
<i>Stoolbend International Airport.</i>

17:55.074 --> 17:56.408
<i>We apologize ahead of time</i>

17:56.492 --> 17:59.703
<i>if you had a pet in the cargo bay
they're frozen.</i>

17:59.787 --> 18:03.332
<i>Here's a tip for next time,
don't bring your pet on vacation.</i>

18:03.415 --> 18:05.125
<i>They don't know the difference.</i>

18:05.209 --> 18:07.669
<i>The local time is 2:44.</i>

18:07.753 --> 18:11.840
Oh, Donna, I feel so much better,
but I bet my former friends

18:11.924 --> 18:13.592
didn't even notice I was gone.

18:13.675 --> 18:16.762
-No way! Look!

18:17.054 --> 18:18.847
What happened to our street?

18:23.769 --> 18:26.563
Hey, Cleveland. What a cluster fudge, huh?

18:26.647 --> 18:29.483
Cleveland, boy, are we glad to see you.

18:29.733 --> 18:32.736
C-Bro! Bad news.
Forgot to water your plants.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.739
Would somebody tell me
what the "H" happened?

18:35.823 --> 18:38.117
Turns out years of inbreeding,
in this case,

18:38.200 --> 18:40.786
did not make me a good race car driver.

18:40.994 --> 18:45.082
I crashed and broke 95 percent
of my "skellyton" bones.

18:45.165 --> 18:46.834
Yeah, uh,
he couldn't pay the medical bills,

18:46.917 --> 18:50.212
so, uh, Holt and I tried
to raise the money with a car wash.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.713
I tore open the fire hydrant

18:51.797 --> 18:53.799
so, eh, so we would have enough water.

18:53.882 --> 18:55.509
Dumbass didn't know how to close it.

18:55.592 --> 18:57.803
Katrina'd my place. Made a sinkhole.

18:57.886 --> 18:59.721
House fell in. Don't tell my mom.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.850
Pulled the power lines with it,
and we lost all our power.

19:02.933 --> 19:03.809
Meat was gonna spoil,

19:03.892 --> 19:07.312
so all's we could do was throw
a big block-party barbecue.

19:07.396 --> 19:08.981
I-I offered to be grill master,

19:09.064 --> 19:12.067
but, uh, because of my big,
clumsy bear hands,

19:12.151 --> 19:13.944
I, uh, caught myself on fire.

19:14.027 --> 19:16.405
So, I, uh, stopped, dropped and rolled

19:16.488 --> 19:18.532
right into a pile of dirty tires.

19:18.615 --> 19:20.993
Anyway,
while they were trying to put me out,

19:21.076 --> 19:23.829
uh, we forgot about the meat, and, uh,
now we got wolves.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.082
I tell you, Cleveland,
none of this would have happened

19:27.166 --> 19:29.710
if we had let you drive the car
in the drag race.

19:29.793 --> 19:32.671
See, Cleveland?
These guys do look up to you.

19:32.754 --> 19:35.257
-They're lost without you.
-You know what?

19:35.340 --> 19:38.594
I guess they do and are, respectively.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.470
Hey, what about that blimp?

19:41.305 --> 19:44.558
I honestly did not see that until now.

19:48.020 --> 19:52.441
Welcome, parents, second wives
and Central American nannies.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.902
Today the kindergarten class will present

19:54.985 --> 19:57.821
their very first oral reports
on a subject matter

19:57.905 --> 19:59.781
of their own choosing.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.492
First up, an adorable little <i>pisher</i>

20:02.576 --> 20:06.246
with the cutest little <i>punum,</i> Rallo Tubbs.

20:07.372 --> 20:11.126
Welcome to my report,
"My Journey to Africa."

20:11.210 --> 20:14.671
When did Rallo go to Africa? Oh...

20:15.005 --> 20:17.007
Africa, a tropical paradise

20:17.090 --> 20:20.969
with white, sandy beaches
and PGA-rated golf courses.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.722
Africa's major exports are pineapples,

20:23.805 --> 20:26.767
macadamia nuts and Jack Johnson.

20:26.850 --> 20:29.436
Each morning when you wake up,
they leave a copy

20:29.519 --> 20:33.232
of Africa's number-one newspaper,
<i>"Oosa" Today.</i>

20:33.315 --> 20:36.443
And after several of what are called
"grown-up drinks,"

20:36.526 --> 20:40.530
it is customary for the elders
to sleep half-naked until three o'clock

20:40.614 --> 20:42.866
and let you swim in the ocean alone.

20:44.159 --> 20:47.287
So, in conclusion,
I would like to say thank you.

20:47.371 --> 20:53.043
Or as they say in Africa, <i>"Mahalo</i>
for coming to the Mauna Kea Four Seasons."

20:53.126 --> 20:56.588
Hey, what a cool dad!
Took his kid to Hawaii!

20:56.922 --> 20:58.048
Bye-bye.
