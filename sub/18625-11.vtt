[music playing]

00:45.045 --> 00:48.966
"War is constant chaos.

00:49.049 --> 00:52.219
The winner will be the one
who controls the chaos,

00:52.302 --> 00:55.013
both his own and his enemy's."

00:55.097 --> 00:55.931
[clicks]

00:56.014 --> 01:00.018
[Strickler] Napoleon's words show
an unquenchable need for conquest.

01:00.185 --> 01:02.688
-A man who could not be stopped.
-[clicks]

01:02.771 --> 01:06.149
So, what was
the French general's downfall?

01:06.233 --> 01:08.819
Did he stare down the barrel of a cannon?

01:10.279 --> 01:13.156
Did he die from the deafening silence
of a classroom?

01:13.240 --> 01:14.658
[laughing]

01:14.741 --> 01:17.286
Look at that. He's got the whole class
eating out of his hand.

01:17.369 --> 01:19.329
His creepy troll hand.

01:19.413 --> 01:24.668
I trusted him. He betrayed me.
And worst of all, he hit on my mother.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.045
I should end him now.

01:27.129 --> 01:29.923
Or you can ask him to divulge
the whereabouts of the bridge

01:30.007 --> 01:31.591
that could release unspeakable evil?

01:31.675 --> 01:32.718
I don't know.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.803
Do you think Strickler knows
you're the Trollhunter?

01:34.886 --> 01:36.596
Bular called me "Young Atlas."

01:36.680 --> 01:39.141
Only Strickler calls me that.
Of course he knows.

01:39.224 --> 01:42.185
But he doesn't know we're onto him.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.103
[Strickler] Malaria.

01:43.186 --> 01:48.400
The world's most powerful army felled
by the bite of an insignificant insect.

01:48.483 --> 01:49.651
[class bell rings]

01:50.402 --> 01:51.486
One last lesson.

01:51.570 --> 01:54.531
Who can tell me
where Napoleon kept his armies?

01:54.615 --> 01:56.074
In his sleevies.

01:56.158 --> 01:57.909
-[laughs]
-[students groan]

01:58.702 --> 02:03.582
Young Atlas, if I could have a brief word
before you leave.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.083
Alone, please.

02:05.167 --> 02:08.419
Not until after he divulges
where the bridge is.

02:09.463 --> 02:12.382
Looks like someone has eyes for Jim.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.092
Remember that letter
I was telling you about?

02:14.176 --> 02:17.387
The one where he was fighting
all of those inner monsters?

02:18.388 --> 02:24.102
-You don't think he's crazy, do you?
-I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

02:26.063 --> 02:28.899
Uh, is everything okay?

02:28.982 --> 02:31.318
Actually, no.

02:31.401 --> 02:32.986
Due to recent developments,

02:33.070 --> 02:35.989
I don't want things to be strange
between us.

02:36.073 --> 02:36.907
Humph.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.034
Your mother has invited me over
for dinner.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.702
I've graciously accepted.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.539
Will that make things awkward?

02:44.623 --> 02:47.042
Awkward? No, no, no.

02:47.125 --> 02:50.295
-It's just dinner. Right?
-Splendid.

02:50.379 --> 02:52.714
Then I shall be seeing you this evening.

02:54.091 --> 02:56.426
-He's coming over for dinner?
-I know.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.346
I thought it was a bad idea at first,
but think about it.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.640
This could work in our favor.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.892
[grunts] Totally. Like how?

03:03.975 --> 03:06.937
You know how he practically lives
in his office?

03:07.020 --> 03:09.523
Well, if he's busy with me,
you guys can break in.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.650
See if he's hiding anything
about the bridge.

03:11.733 --> 03:15.237
"Covert operation." My two favorite words!
After "taco truck," of course.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.280
No more secrets. No more lies.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.408
It's all coming out. Tonight.

03:19.491 --> 03:20.325
[whispers] Oh, no.

03:21.159 --> 03:24.913
If you can find out where the bridge is,
then it is goodbye, Mr. S.

03:27.040 --> 03:27.916
[locker door closes]

03:27.999 --> 03:29.543
I do not approve of this plan.

03:29.626 --> 03:33.630
It lacks a certain
"killing the changeling" component.

03:33.713 --> 03:37.134
I would love to, but not until
they locate the bridge, okay?

03:37.217 --> 03:39.052
And find out what he wants with me.

03:39.136 --> 03:43.682
We could rip off his limbs,
make him talk, more like scream.

03:43.765 --> 03:47.978
-Now that sounds like a good plan.
-No, no ripping anything.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.772
My mom... ugh!
She kind of likes him.

03:50.856 --> 03:51.857
And since she's here,

03:51.940 --> 03:54.693
I can't have you busting chops
unless it's a last resort,

03:54.776 --> 03:56.653
and only if it's a last resort.

03:56.737 --> 04:01.199
[sighs] How will I know
this "last resort"?

04:01.283 --> 04:03.577
Okay, if everything's cool,
I'll stomp once.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.830
If I run into any trouble,
I'll stomp twice. Got it?

04:06.913 --> 04:11.668
-Two times. Then I tear his limbs.
-[doorbell rings]

04:11.752 --> 04:15.338
Just stay down here. And no limb tearing.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.839
[Strickler] Hello.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.050
I didn't know what varietal you like,

04:19.134 --> 04:22.429
so I brought a pinot noir,
the "heartbreak grape."

04:22.512 --> 04:25.182
We don't judge here.
All kinds are welcome.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.936
-Mr. Lake.
-Mr. Strickler.

04:30.020 --> 04:34.149
-Please, my friends call me Walt.
-What do your enemies call you?

04:34.357 --> 04:35.650
[chuckles]

04:38.361 --> 04:39.196
[whisk clatters]

04:42.657 --> 04:44.910
[man] Zack, Carina, it's time for dinner!

04:44.993 --> 04:46.578
[Carina] Be right there!
[Zack] Coming, Dad!

04:46.661 --> 04:47.746
[sizzling]

04:47.829 --> 04:51.166
Hints of tart without being promiscuous.
If you know what I mean. Yes.

04:51.249 --> 04:52.417
-[Strickler chuckles]
-[slams]

04:52.959 --> 04:55.045
The teacher is in the henhouse,
mission is a go.

04:55.128 --> 04:55.962
[Toby] <i>Copy that, Trollhunter.</i>

04:56.046 --> 04:58.965
I'm waiting at the rendezvous point.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.677
I said, I'm waiting
at the rendezvous point.

05:02.761 --> 05:03.929
NotEnrique!

05:07.015 --> 05:10.393
Give me the socks first.
Then I'll let you out.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.854
Now? That wasn't the deal.

05:13.814 --> 05:14.689
[locker rattles]

05:17.651 --> 05:18.693
[slurps]

05:20.570 --> 05:22.322
You get the other one
when the job is done.

05:24.908 --> 05:25.784
Mmm!

05:25.867 --> 05:27.202
[thumps] Open up.

05:27.285 --> 05:28.119
[yelps]

05:28.411 --> 05:30.288
-What's the job?
-You're a changeling.

05:30.372 --> 05:32.791
Blinky says we'll need one
to find a changeling's secrets.

05:32.874 --> 05:37.170
-No. No way.
-Oh, would you rather be Bular kibble?

05:37.254 --> 05:39.214
Fine, let's make it snappy.

05:39.297 --> 05:43.426
I got a 9:00 p.m. feeding
I don't wanna miss.

05:45.512 --> 05:46.888
[grunts]

05:47.847 --> 05:50.433
You know, I could've just let you in.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.481
[Toby humming]

06:03.863 --> 06:07.867
Oh, my, the fabled Halls of Alexandria

06:07.951 --> 06:12.122
could not hold a candle
to the high school of Arcadia Oaks.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.000
-The halls of what?
-Aha! Feigned ignorance.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.586
You are a funny little man, Tobias.

06:17.669 --> 06:18.962
[Aaarrrgghh!!! grunts]

06:19.045 --> 06:22.299
Oh, careful, wingman.
We gotta be stealthy.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.425
We can't leave a trace.

06:23.508 --> 06:26.303
Covert operations
are supposed to be covert.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.846
[squeaking]

06:28.388 --> 06:30.682
What? What? What?
I thought the coast was clear.

06:30.765 --> 06:33.977
Was that my responsibi--?

06:34.060 --> 06:35.312
[humming]

06:36.313 --> 06:38.607
What in the hallway heck...?

06:41.735 --> 06:42.611
[rustling]

06:44.863 --> 06:45.905
[squeaking fades]

06:45.989 --> 06:47.991
-[all sigh]
-[Blinky] Whew.

06:49.826 --> 06:52.954
Strickler? What are you doing here?

06:53.038 --> 06:53.955
[grunts]

06:57.626 --> 06:58.543
Ah.

07:00.003 --> 07:02.922
-[Strickler] I'll try not to bore Jim.
-What're you talking about? Don't worry.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.887
[grunts]

07:09.971 --> 07:12.515
[sighs] Fortune favors the bold, Claire.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.435
Huh...? Claire?

07:17.354 --> 07:20.899
[Strickler's voice] My friends
call me Walt. I didn't know what varie...

07:21.691 --> 07:22.609
Yes, absolutely.

07:22.692 --> 07:26.655
[Strickler] So I said to my co-worker,
"I brought you a midnight snack."

07:26.738 --> 07:29.950
Too bad for him,
he had indigestion for days.

07:30.033 --> 07:30.867
[chuckles]

07:30.951 --> 07:32.744
Well, that's the problem
with eating Italian.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.371
[Strickler, Barbara laughing]

07:36.957 --> 07:38.541
[distorted laughing]

07:39.834 --> 07:41.336
[phone buzzes]

07:41.419 --> 07:44.631
Oh, I'm sorry, it's the hospital.
I have to take this.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.424
Go, go.

07:46.508 --> 07:49.010
I'll try not to bore Jim to death.

07:49.094 --> 07:50.303
[snorts]

07:51.096 --> 07:53.264
That's a funny story
you were just talking about.

07:53.348 --> 07:54.975
Who was it again
you were forced to work with?

07:55.058 --> 07:57.644
The superintendent's son.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.896
He's a bit bullish.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.231
"Bullish." Huh.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.192
That's an interesting word.
He sounds like a real monster.

08:05.110 --> 08:09.114
-Yes. I know.
-You know what?

08:11.658 --> 08:14.202
I know you know.

08:14.285 --> 08:15.537
Hm.

08:20.542 --> 08:23.086
How much do you know?

08:23.169 --> 08:26.506
You didn't know I knew,
but now you know,

08:26.589 --> 08:28.425
I know.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.678
So I guess we both know.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.225
Know what?

08:37.308 --> 08:38.809
[ringtone music playing]

08:38.893 --> 08:40.395
[Mary] <i>Hey, C-bomb. What ya doing?</i>

08:40.477 --> 08:43.023
Can't talk, Mare.
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

08:43.106 --> 08:47.068
[Mary] <i>Oh, my gosh!</i>
<i>You are totally at his house, aren't you?</i>

08:47.152 --> 08:48.695
<i>You are pathological.</i>

08:49.362 --> 08:51.990
Bular called you "Young Atlas"
to force this very moment.

08:52.073 --> 08:56.244
He told me, if I can't get you to hand
over the amulet, I should kill you.

08:56.327 --> 08:57.871
You would kill me in front of my mom?

08:57.954 --> 09:01.750
Granted, your death might affect
our relationship, but I will if I have to.

09:01.833 --> 09:04.753
That's funny.
I was just thinking the same thing.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.629
How about you tell me
where the bridge is,

09:06.713 --> 09:09.382
and I'll leave your head
attached to your body?

09:09.466 --> 09:11.968
It seems we each have something
the other wants.

09:12.052 --> 09:15.305
-You boys want something while I'm up?
-I'd love a sharp knife, for the steak.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.016
-Oh, me too. Sharper the better.
-Sure.

09:25.523 --> 09:28.359
-[groans]
-[Blinky] I'm afraid to say it, Tobias,

09:28.443 --> 09:31.946
but everything here
appears to be quite normal.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.200
Hmm.

09:35.283 --> 09:38.745
If I were Strickler,
where would I keep my secrets?

09:38.828 --> 09:39.788
[clicks]

09:39.871 --> 09:42.457
Oh, shoot, I broke his--

09:42.540 --> 09:44.709
I found a key! I found a secret key!

09:44.793 --> 09:48.922
-How spy is this thing?
-Key? To where?

09:49.005 --> 09:51.466
A changeling key for a changeling lock.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.051
Look. Look for a lock.

10:01.476 --> 10:04.187
[gasps]
I haven't seen one of these in ages.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.607
[banging, trilling piano keys]

10:10.693 --> 10:12.237
Guys. I found it!

10:13.655 --> 10:15.323
What the...? It won't open.

10:15.406 --> 10:16.908
As I told you,

10:16.991 --> 10:21.204
by only the hand of a changeling
can one open a changeling lock.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.413
Huh?

10:30.505 --> 10:32.173
[clicks, rattles]

-[Blinky gasps]
-[Aaarrrgghh!!!] Found it.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.185
Whoa!

10:44.811 --> 10:46.479
I feel violated.

10:48.398 --> 10:49.732
Gee!

10:49.816 --> 10:52.068
Look at all this stuff.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.404
What could he be doing with these?

10:55.822 --> 10:57.073
Huh.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.700
-What is it?
-Curious.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.411
[slurps]

11:02.036 --> 11:03.997
Whoa! Wicked.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.248
Undoubtedly so.

11:05.331 --> 11:08.501
<i>The Book of Ga-huel,</i> Gumm-Gumm history.

11:08.585 --> 11:12.005
Whoa! Is this Gunmar?
Dang, look at this guy.

11:12.088 --> 11:15.508
-He looks just like you, Aaarrrgghh!!!
-That's 'cause it <i>is.</i>

11:15.592 --> 11:18.720
Okay, yeah, real funny. That's not him.

11:18.803 --> 11:19.637
[sighs]

11:21.180 --> 11:25.184
-You used to eat people?
-You speak the unfortunate truth.

11:25.268 --> 11:28.771
Aaarrrgghh!!! was a Gumm-Gumm
and a general in Gunmar's horde.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.523
But just before the Battle of Killahead,

11:30.607 --> 11:34.777
he absconded his flesh-eating ways
to take an oath of peace.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.154
If it weren't for his aid,

11:36.237 --> 11:39.949
the world as you know it
would look remarkably different.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.534
People ran away.

11:41.618 --> 11:47.749
Scream, "Aaarrrgghh!!! No. No. Stop."

11:51.002 --> 11:54.422
You might have been one then,
but you're one of us now, wingman.

11:58.927 --> 12:00.511
[Aaarrrgghh!!!] Boom, boom.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.607
I'm stuffed. I can hardly move.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.735
Jim, your cooking alone
should warrant you an A.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.198
I hope you saved some room
for some hot apple pie.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.825
I just need a second.
Talk amongst yourselves.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.078

[Strickler chuckles]

12:29.540 --> 12:32.126
[Strickler] Give me the amulet.

12:32.210 --> 12:33.836
Over my dead body.

12:33.920 --> 12:37.256
I know what you're capable of.
I know what you're not capable of.

12:37.340 --> 12:42.220
I know you have a thing for Claire,
and I know you'd do anything for Toby.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.180
You want to keep your mother out of this,

12:44.263 --> 12:47.934
and you look to Blinky
as your surrogate father.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.310
Poor Jim.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.896
I even know as we speak,

12:51.980 --> 12:54.357
your adorable little friends
are breaking into my office.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.193
Do you think I'd be so foolish

12:57.276 --> 13:00.947
as to leave important information
lying around unguarded?

13:01.030 --> 13:02.991
But did you know that Draal
is in my basement?

13:03.199 --> 13:04.033
[taps]

13:05.076 --> 13:07.036
A Draal?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.830

-[knives clinking]

13:37.191 --> 13:38.026
Whoa!

Ugh!

13:45.324 --> 13:46.576
[clatters]

13:48.369 --> 13:50.955
Now, it's my turn
to let you in on a secret.

13:51.039 --> 13:53.583
While you might have had this Draal
in your basement,

13:53.666 --> 13:56.085
I have an Antramonstrum in my office.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.713
-A what?
-Oh, it's just a vaporous creature.

13:58.796 --> 14:01.507
Dormant until disturbed,
shockingly fierce,

14:01.591 --> 14:04.927
and excellent at erasing sneaky-snakes.

14:05.678 --> 14:06.512

14:14.771 --> 14:16.689

[growls]

14:20.193 --> 14:21.110
[gasps]

14:21.194 --> 14:24.822
What do you think?
Good look for picture day?

14:27.617 --> 14:28.451
[clinks]

14:28.534 --> 14:29.827
[Troll Strickler laughs]

14:35.124 --> 14:37.668
Give me the amulet.

14:37.752 --> 14:40.838
You want the amulet? Come and take it.

14:40.922 --> 14:43.800
For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.093
[whirring]

14:46.260 --> 14:51.057
-How do you stop the Antramonstrum?
-Your friends will never survive!

14:51.140 --> 14:52.225
[whistling]

14:53.017 --> 14:56.938
-Anyone want coffee?
-Decaf for me.

14:57.021 --> 14:57.939
[humming]

14:58.022 --> 15:02.443
Time to teach my star pupil a new lesson.

15:09.951 --> 15:12.495
Uh, guys, is this important?

15:12.578 --> 15:14.747
Oh, that's nothing.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.625
Probably just... decorative art.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.670
Tobias, do you realize
what you've just discovered?

15:20.753 --> 15:22.380
Strickler's got hemorrhoids?

15:22.463 --> 15:25.758
No, it's a "fetch,"
an artifact of great power,

15:25.842 --> 15:29.387
a pinhole-sized breach into the Darklands.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.597
It's how our changeling friend here
came into our realm.

15:31.681 --> 15:35.268
-Handle that with care.
-Some expert <i>you </i> are.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.481
[faint hissing]

[crackles]

15:52.410 --> 15:53.411
Ooh.

15:53.494 --> 15:54.620
Feels kind of tickly.

15:54.704 --> 15:58.458
Why don't you take a peek
on the other side?

15:58.541 --> 16:00.668
Maybe you'll see the Nuñez kid.

16:09.093 --> 16:09.927
Whoa.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.767
So that's why they call it
the "Darklands."

16:25.902 --> 16:27.069
[hissing]

16:30.948 --> 16:32.617
[sniffs]

16:32.700 --> 16:35.953
Smoke. Smoke. Smoke!

16:36.037 --> 16:37.955
[Blinky] We've got an Antramonstrum!

16:38.039 --> 16:41.417
Enrique? You here, little dude?

16:41.501 --> 16:45.671
[voice] Who are you?

16:45.755 --> 16:46.589
Uh-oh.

16:49.217 --> 16:52.011
Yah! Get away. Get out of here. Be gone.

16:54.555 --> 16:57.141
[voice] Who are you?

16:57.225 --> 16:58.142
[moans]

17:00.228 --> 17:03.314
Who are you?

17:03.397 --> 17:04.898
Whoa!

17:05.525 --> 17:08.402
Who are you?

17:08.486 --> 17:10.988
What's happening?

17:11.071 --> 17:12.365
Agh-hh!

17:17.118 --> 17:18.246

17:18.329 --> 17:20.080

17:20.830 --> 17:23.084

17:23.166 --> 17:24.417
[hissing]

17:24.502 --> 17:26.253
-I'm not okay.
-Don't worry, Tobias.

17:26.337 --> 17:27.964
Aaarrrgghh!!! and I
will lure it away from you.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.591
Follow us, you gaseous cretin.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.684
Oh, dear, I thought my taunt
was quite bedeviling.

17:39.767 --> 17:42.270
Wait, where's NotEnrique?

17:42.353 --> 17:43.771
That little charlatan.

17:43.854 --> 17:44.855
[whistling]

17:44.939 --> 17:46.899
Suckers. All in a night's work.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.076
Oh, boy.

17:57.159 --> 18:00.538
I'll just be a few more minutes, okay?
Everything's fine.

18:00.621 --> 18:01.539
[squirts]

18:03.499 --> 18:06.294
This war is millennia older than you, boy.

18:06.377 --> 18:08.629
You can't stand
against the tide of history.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.381
Gunmar is inevitable.

18:13.134 --> 18:16.095
If you care about your mother,
don't fight it.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.180
You were always my favorite.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.184
Don't you see?
I'm only trying to protect you.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.020
[clanking]

18:27.023 --> 18:28.816
I can take care of myself.

18:29.942 --> 18:30.776
[blades ring]

18:38.117 --> 18:39.827
-[groans] My arm!
-Where's the bridge?

18:39.910 --> 18:42.622
-I'll never tell you!
-Where is the bridge?

18:42.705 --> 18:45.958
Who is ready for pie? Voila.

18:46.584 --> 18:47.418
[amulet rattles]

18:47.501 --> 18:50.463
-Um...
-Where is that contact lens?

18:52.089 --> 18:54.592
Ah, here it is.

18:55.676 --> 18:59.764
-I didn't know you wore contacts.
-There's a lot you don't know about me.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.686
[smoke hissing]

19:06.646 --> 19:08.105
[Toby yelling]

19:12.401 --> 19:14.654
I can't believe you left us
to be eaten by a fart cloud!

19:14.737 --> 19:16.906
I can't believe you trusted a changeling.

19:16.989 --> 19:20.826
-Good point.
-Here comes Silent-But-Deadly.

19:20.910 --> 19:23.079
Okay, if we work together, we can...

19:26.707 --> 19:30.378
See you, Tubby. It's been grand!

19:31.921 --> 19:34.298
You've got to be kidding me.

19:34.382 --> 19:35.383
[hissing]

19:35.466 --> 19:37.051
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

19:39.345 --> 19:40.638
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

19:40.721 --> 19:42.682
Oh, my gosh! I'm doing it! I'm doing it!

19:42.765 --> 19:44.850
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

19:44.934 --> 19:45.810
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

19:45.893 --> 19:49.230
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh, I'm doing it!
I'm really doing it! Oh, my gosh!

19:49.313 --> 19:51.565
I'm really doing it. But I'm terrified.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.651
Such conflicting emotions!

20:23.848 --> 20:24.807
[grunting]

20:37.903 --> 20:40.573
-[Toby] Good timing.
-I knew you had it in you, Tubby.

20:40.656 --> 20:41.699
-It's Toby.
-[NotEnrique yells]

20:41.782 --> 20:44.118
[Toby] Eat me, Bottle-Breath.

20:44.201 --> 20:48.497
I can safely say, the Antramonstrum
has just been... <i>schooled.</i>

20:48.581 --> 20:49.915
[laughs] Hah!

20:51.834 --> 20:53.794
What about Jim?

20:53.878 --> 20:55.671
I insist. Take it home.

20:56.172 --> 20:57.298
[whimpers] Oh.

20:57.381 --> 21:00.634
-The recipe would have sufficed.
-No, we insist.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.681
Good night, Barbara.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.686
See you at school, Young Atlas.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.438
It should be interesting,

21:12.521 --> 21:14.857
now that we've gotten to know
each other so well.

21:14.940 --> 21:18.360
It will be a shame when I won't have you
for a teacher anymore.

21:20.154 --> 21:21.447
[raps]

21:21.864 --> 21:23.032
[moans]

21:23.115 --> 21:24.450
That went well, right?

21:24.533 --> 21:26.827
I don't know.
He seemed kind of two-faced to me.

21:26.911 --> 21:28.287
Two-faced?

21:28.370 --> 21:30.706
It sounded like you guys
got along so well.

21:32.249 --> 21:35.294
Honestly? He's not the guy he says he is.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.630
Honey, I know
this might be hard for you...

21:37.713 --> 21:40.466
Mom, I don't want you to see him again.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.259
Yeah, I really expected more from you.

21:46.514 --> 21:50.309
I tried to slow them down
as much as I could, boss man,

21:50.392 --> 21:51.852
but they found the fetch.

21:51.936 --> 21:54.396
We can't expect everything to go our way.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.190
Isn't it past your bedtime?

21:56.273 --> 21:59.860
Nah. The parents think I sleep
through the night now.

21:59.944 --> 22:02.780
So, did you off the boy?

22:02.863 --> 22:08.202
No, but I got what was most important.

22:08.285 --> 22:11.539
