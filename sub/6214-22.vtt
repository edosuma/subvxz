WEBVTT

00:01.368 --> 00:05.606
Okay, Bride-to-Be!
Up and at 'em!

00:05.606 --> 00:07.341
Hey!
Wake up!

00:07.341 --> 00:10.777
Don't make me
put your hand
in warm water again.

00:11.044 --> 00:12.112
Morning.

00:12.112 --> 00:16.283
I guess your breath explains
my "Trapped in Tuna Boat" dream.

00:16.283 --> 00:17.885
Oh! Can you believe it?

00:17.885 --> 00:19.620
I'm actually
getting married today.

00:19.620 --> 00:20.888
Whoo-hoo!

00:21.321 --> 00:23.090
So how do you feel?

00:23.090 --> 00:25.692
Nervous, frightened, scared,
tense, petrified?

00:25.692 --> 00:27.528
Excited, happy, joyful.
I'm getting married.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.996
How do you think I feel?

00:28.996 --> 00:31.164
Nervous, frightened, scared.

00:31.164 --> 00:33.901
I just want to make sure
you're not getting cold feet.

00:33.901 --> 00:36.970
Salem, I do not
have cold feet.

00:39.773 --> 00:40.841
See?

00:40.841 --> 00:42.509
They're not cold.

00:42.509 --> 00:44.878
They're frozen solid.

00:48.181 --> 00:54.955
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

00:54.955 --> 01:00.994
♪ I'm reaching out
and living by my rules... ♪

01:00.994 --> 01:04.164
♪ Time's moving way too fast ♪

01:04.164 --> 01:08.502
♪ I wanna make it last... ♪

01:10.304 --> 01:13.807
♪ 'Cause I'm out on my own now ♪

01:13.807 --> 01:18.946
♪ And I like the way it feels. ♪

01:23.450 --> 01:26.787
Look, I don't care what your
invoice says, no one is getting
married in this kitchen.

01:26.787 --> 01:29.656
Yes, for the ten-thousandth
time, I am positive.

01:29.656 --> 01:31.858
Get off the parkway
and take a right.

01:31.858 --> 01:32.859
Left.

01:32.859 --> 01:34.661
Get off the parkway
and take a left.

01:34.661 --> 01:36.029
Trust me,
it's just down the street.

01:36.029 --> 01:38.265
Church, steeple, you open the
door and see all the people.

01:38.265 --> 01:40.200
Go!

01:40.200 --> 01:41.168
Hey, what's going on?

01:41.168 --> 01:42.536
Why aren't the flowers
at the church?

01:42.536 --> 01:43.670
Why aren't
you guys ready?

01:43.670 --> 01:45.639
"Is there anything
I can do," I ask?

01:45.639 --> 01:47.841
"Oh, no, mother, just
stay out of it," he says.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.042
Well, if you ask me--

01:49.042 --> 01:50.310
Mother, just stay out of it!

01:50.310 --> 01:52.613
Aaron, don't worry.
We've got it all under control.

01:52.613 --> 01:55.315
Under control?
I still have to do
my hair, and my nails,

01:55.315 --> 01:57.684
and my make-up
has to be perfect.

01:57.684 --> 02:00.253
Some of us don't
have the option
of wearing a veil.

02:00.253 --> 02:03.056
Oh, my God, I still
have to steam Sabrina's veil!

02:03.056 --> 02:05.726
Something tells me
I'm not getting breakfast.

02:05.726 --> 02:06.727
From this kitchen?

02:06.727 --> 02:07.294
( <i>laughs</i> )

02:07.294 --> 02:08.795
Count your blessings.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.364
Okay, okay, please, please

02:10.364 --> 02:12.766
just tell me that Sabrina
is a little further along.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.568
Yes, Morgan got her up
hours ago.

02:14.568 --> 02:17.504
I didn't get her up.
You were supposed to get her up.

02:17.504 --> 02:19.072
Will you excuse us
for just one second?

02:19.506 --> 02:21.508
Oh, ah, his name's Al.

02:21.508 --> 02:23.310
He's got 300 pounds of shrimp
in his trunk,

02:23.310 --> 02:24.811
and he doesn't know
where to put it.

02:24.811 --> 02:25.779
Give the phone to your mother.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.581
She'll tell him where to put it.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.051
Hurry up!

02:31.051 --> 02:32.819
Hey, I told you
not to lick it.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.088
Agh!

02:35.088 --> 02:36.590
I'm sure I'll get
the feeling back

02:36.590 --> 02:37.791
before I walk down the aisle.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.660
Sabrina, aren't you worried?

02:39.660 --> 02:42.029
This obviously
happened for a reason.

02:42.029 --> 02:42.729
Yeah, the only reason

02:42.729 --> 02:44.131
it happened is because
I'm a witch,

02:44.131 --> 02:46.333
which just means that magic
is always messing up my life.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.068
Sabrina, wake up!

02:48.068 --> 02:49.469
Oh, good, you're up,
I'm off the hook.

02:49.469 --> 02:51.938
But you've got to hurry
and... what's going on?

02:51.938 --> 02:53.940
Oh, uh, well, it just
occurred to me that I

02:53.940 --> 02:56.710
might not have ordered enough
crushed ice for the reception.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.612
Well, it's show time,
and I'm not going

02:58.612 --> 03:01.114
to have you screwing up
my big day.

03:01.114 --> 03:03.350
Your big day.
I mean...

03:03.350 --> 03:04.851
What she means
is everything's
under control.

03:04.851 --> 03:05.986
But you've got
to get dressed.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.054
Oh, and don't forget

03:07.054 --> 03:09.790
your "Something Old, New,
Borrowed, and Blue."

03:09.790 --> 03:11.591
Got it. Well, except
for the Something Old.

03:11.591 --> 03:12.959
And the Something New,

03:12.959 --> 03:16.697
and the Something Borrowed.
My toes are kind of blue.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.831
Oh, my God,
what am I going to do?!

03:17.831 --> 03:19.166
Don't worry,
we'll take
care of it.

03:19.166 --> 03:19.966
Oh, why not?

03:19.966 --> 03:22.135
We're apparently
taking care
of everything else.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.837
Thanks, I really
appreciate it.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.072
Sabrina, are you okay?

03:25.072 --> 03:27.774
It's not like you
to not be on top
of everything.

03:27.774 --> 03:28.842
The flowers, the caterer,

03:28.842 --> 03:30.777
and you're an hour
behind schedule.

03:30.777 --> 03:32.245
Which is why
I can't be standing here

03:32.245 --> 03:33.980
having this conversation.
Really, I'm fine.

03:33.980 --> 03:36.817
I just need a few minutes
to collect my thoughts.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.887
Okay, thoughts collected...

03:40.887 --> 03:41.755
and thoughts lost.

03:41.755 --> 03:42.422
Hi!

03:42.422 --> 03:45.025
Oh, congratulations, Sabrina,
I am so happy for you.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.660
Thanks, look,
I'm kind of in a panic here,

03:46.660 --> 03:49.429
so I don't have time
for your teen 'tude right now.

03:49.429 --> 03:50.530
What's up with her?

03:50.530 --> 03:52.499
She's having second thoughts.

03:52.499 --> 03:53.834
Oh-ho-ho.

03:53.834 --> 03:54.968
Mm-hmm.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.970
No, no "A-ha-ha",
no "Mm-hmm",

03:56.970 --> 03:58.138
and no second thoughts.

03:58.138 --> 04:00.907
Maybe I'm having some regrets,
but that's only because

04:00.907 --> 04:02.676
so many people I love
can't be here.

04:02.676 --> 04:05.312
I mean my Mom's in Peru,
you never know about my Dad,

04:05.312 --> 04:07.380
and I have no idea why
my Aunts haven't RSVPd.

04:07.380 --> 04:08.148
Is Harvey coming?

04:08.148 --> 04:09.416
No, Harvey's not coming.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.984
Well, don't you want him there?

04:10.984 --> 04:11.752
I don't know.

04:11.752 --> 04:15.021
Yes, I would love
to have Harvey there,
but he just can't be.

04:15.021 --> 04:16.556
You're too young to understand.

04:16.556 --> 04:19.693
AARON: ( <i>screaming</i> ):
Sabrina! Would you
come down here? Quickly!

04:19.693 --> 04:22.229
So, the Bride isn't the only one

04:22.229 --> 04:25.031
whose voice is tinged
with terror.

04:25.031 --> 04:25.699
See?

04:25.699 --> 04:26.867
That's your problem.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.336
You can't tell the difference
between terror and pure joy.

04:29.336 --> 04:31.371
AARON: ( <i>screaming</i> ):
Sabrina!
I'm coming!

04:33.974 --> 04:37.144
Ah, don't touch
the Llama, it's a gift.

04:37.144 --> 04:38.745
I suggest patio furniture,

04:38.745 --> 04:41.181
but no, that's too
"out there."

04:41.181 --> 04:42.282
Aunt Hilda!

04:42.282 --> 04:43.316
Hi, honey!

04:43.316 --> 04:44.718
Oh, you came!

04:44.718 --> 04:45.752
Of course!

04:45.752 --> 04:47.521
And you brought me
a llama.

04:47.521 --> 04:48.855
I hope you don't
already have one.

04:48.855 --> 04:51.091
Ha, ha.
Sabrina, honey,
what's going on?

04:51.091 --> 04:52.692
Oh, Aaron,
this is my Aunt Hilda!

04:52.692 --> 04:53.493
Aunt Hilda,
my Aaron.

04:53.493 --> 04:55.028
Isn't he great?
Isn't she great?

04:55.028 --> 04:56.163
Yeah,
she's great.

04:56.163 --> 04:58.298
Did we register
for pack animals?

04:58.298 --> 05:00.300
Hey, cut me some slack.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.668
There's not a lot
you can pick up in Peru.

05:01.668 --> 05:03.436
It was either this,
or dysentery.

05:03.436 --> 05:05.372
You were in Peru?
Did you see my mom?

05:05.372 --> 05:07.507
Yes, and you cannot believe...

05:07.507 --> 05:08.642
Uh, let's talk in the kitchen.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.443
Okay.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.213
Uh, I swear,
I'll be ready in two minutes.

05:13.213 --> 05:16.316
Uh, chat with my cousin Amanda.
She's surly yet charming.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.285
Amanda say something
surly for the Jacobs.

05:18.285 --> 05:19.286
Hi.

05:19.286 --> 05:20.654
Oh, look at you.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.823
It's so hard to find
a bridesmaid's dress

05:22.823 --> 05:24.424
that looks good
on everyone.

05:24.424 --> 05:26.326
Hey, I have melted people
for less than that.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.727
Okay, no pointing
at the in-laws,

05:27.727 --> 05:31.264
at least not until
after the wedding.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.399
So, you saw my Mom?

05:32.399 --> 05:34.267
What'd she say?
How'd she look?

05:34.267 --> 05:36.236
Why don't you
ask her yourself?

05:36.870 --> 05:37.971
Mom!

05:37.971 --> 05:39.806
Sweetheart,
I'm so happy for you.

05:39.806 --> 05:40.907
I can't believe you're here!

05:40.907 --> 05:42.142
And you're not a ball of wax!

05:42.142 --> 05:43.877
Well, you can thank Hilda
and Zelda for that.

05:43.877 --> 05:46.413
They took me in front
of the Witch's Council
and pleaded my case.

05:46.413 --> 05:47.647
Well, every mother should be

05:47.647 --> 05:48.815
at her daughter's wedding.

05:48.815 --> 05:51.117
Preferably not as something
you can stick a wick in.

05:51.117 --> 05:52.485
Thank you so much.

05:52.485 --> 05:55.088
But where's Aunt Zelda?

05:55.088 --> 05:57.057
Well, you know
the Witch's Council.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.558
There's always a trade-off.

05:59.626 --> 06:00.727
Aunt Zelda?

06:00.727 --> 06:05.265
Yup, they asked
for a volunteer,
so I volunteered her.

06:05.265 --> 06:06.666
Don't worry.
It's just till
after the wedding.

06:06.666 --> 06:07.901
Oh, thank you, thank you,

06:07.901 --> 06:09.569
thank you, this is
the greatest gift ever,

06:09.569 --> 06:11.872
and I'm suddenly feeling
1000% better.

06:11.872 --> 06:12.539
Can you believe it?

06:12.539 --> 06:14.441
All the Spellman women,
together again.

06:14.441 --> 06:16.843
And most of us in human form.

06:16.843 --> 06:18.245
Wait, where's Amanda?

06:20.213 --> 06:21.214
Hi, Harvey!

06:21.214 --> 06:22.983
( <i>screams</i> )

06:31.157 --> 06:32.492
Surprised to see me?

06:32.492 --> 06:34.027
Not at all.

06:34.027 --> 06:37.931
I wanted to test my new engine
by ramming it into a tree.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.532
What are you doing here?

06:39.532 --> 06:41.434
I want to bring you
to Sabrina's wedding.

06:41.434 --> 06:43.937
Apparently, she loves
getting people as gifts.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.840
Sorry, but there's no way
I'm going to that wedding,

06:46.840 --> 06:48.608
gift-wrapped, or otherwise.

06:48.608 --> 06:51.544
But I know Sabrina
wants you there.

06:51.544 --> 06:53.680
She does?

06:53.680 --> 06:54.681
That's too bad.

06:54.681 --> 06:55.815
It's not going to happen.

06:55.815 --> 06:56.883
Why not?

06:56.883 --> 06:58.752
You're too young
to understand.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.521
Ugh, I really wish
people would quit saying that.

07:01.521 --> 07:05.258
I wonder if it's too late
to go halfsies on that llama?

07:05.258 --> 07:06.259
Amanda, wait!

07:06.259 --> 07:08.662
The nearest phone
is a 15 mile walk.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.163
Oh, sorry.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.900
What is this?
"Fun with Mortals Week?"

07:13.900 --> 07:15.969
Yeah, like mortals
are ever fun.

07:21.207 --> 07:22.709
Sabrina,
I know the number one rule

07:22.709 --> 07:24.778
about being a maid of honor
is "Don't upstage the bride,"

07:24.778 --> 07:26.579
but if you're going
to make it so easy...

07:26.579 --> 07:28.915
Don't worry, two minutes,
and I'll be absolutely dazzling.

07:28.915 --> 07:29.849
Wear this!

07:29.849 --> 07:32.686
It's old, it's blue,
and I borrowed it from you.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.688
Oh! And that stain?
It's new.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.724
Thanks, but I kind of already
have an outfit picked out.

07:37.724 --> 07:39.125
Sabrina, come on,
what are you doing?

07:39.125 --> 07:41.294
I know, I know,
two minutes, I swear.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.595
Good, because two minutes ago

07:42.595 --> 07:44.130
is when we were supposed
to have left for the church.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.732
But, I'm glad
you're in a much
better mood.

07:45.732 --> 07:48.635
I am. My family's all here,
and all is right with the world.

07:48.635 --> 07:51.137
I'm glad. I don't want you
going into this with any doubts.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.873
Doubts?
I was never doubting.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.945
If that's true,
I'm definitely
in the wrong place.

07:58.945 --> 07:59.746
Do I know you?

07:59.746 --> 08:02.816
I doubt it. I'm Doubt.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.652
Apparently, there's some serious
doubting going on around here.

08:05.652 --> 08:06.753
No, no doubt.

08:06.753 --> 08:09.823
Although their last CD
was one of my favorite.

08:09.823 --> 08:10.724
Look, for the last time

I've got hundreds of people
cooling their jets

08:15.161 --> 08:17.864
in pews across town, and my mom
just flew in from Peru.

08:17.864 --> 08:20.433
I'm getting married.

08:20.433 --> 08:24.671
I guess I went
all the way to
the North Star for nothing.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.676
Oh, it's so beautiful

08:29.676 --> 08:32.579
That's the essence
of who Aaron is.

08:34.614 --> 08:35.815
This is Aaron's Soul Stone?

08:35.815 --> 08:36.883
Exactly.

08:36.883 --> 08:39.986
Hey, for me,
that was pretty definitive.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.021
I think.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.689
Look, I'll tell you
something definitive.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.524
You're tap dancing
on my last good nerve.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.692
Why are you
giving me this?

08:45.692 --> 08:47.460
Because that's what
you're doubting, isn't it?

08:47.460 --> 08:49.396
Whether or not
you and Aaron
are soul mates?

08:49.396 --> 08:53.266
No! Well, maybe...

08:53.266 --> 08:55.268
I, can you ever
really know for sure?

08:55.268 --> 08:57.637
Ugh! Why are you doing this
to me on my wedding day?

08:57.637 --> 08:59.739
Better than the day after.

08:59.739 --> 09:01.174
If it's truly meant to be,

09:01.174 --> 09:03.777
your pieces
should fit together perfectly.

Or, at least
I'm pretty certain I'm certain.

09:16.623 --> 09:17.791
Sabrina,
what's the hold-up?

09:17.791 --> 09:19.926
Aaron and his parents
just left for the church.

09:19.926 --> 09:21.027
Oh, I know, I know.

on the something blue.

for this right now.

Okay, one ping,

Oh, I'm, ah,

What?

10:11.111 --> 10:12.745
No, no running,

10:17.817 --> 10:18.885
Yes, everything's fine.

11:26.586 --> 11:28.188

showed up.

I can't stand him.

is yaking all over

I'm just a little nervous,

12:43.329 --> 12:44.497

I left the oven on.

Do you mean,
are we destined to be together?

all we can do is...

13:10.823 --> 13:13.793
try to make each other happy.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.496
There's one thing
I don't doubt...

that I love you.

13:19.098 --> 13:21.200

You got to stop
all the pointing

17:17.236 --> 17:18.104
and incanting

17:18.104 --> 17:19.672
and listen to what
your heart is telling you.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.340
But...
No buts.

17:21.340 --> 17:23.042
Life doesn't have
any guarantees.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.112
All you can do is try
to make each other happy.

17:26.112 --> 17:28.781
That's the same thing
that Aaron said.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.918
Well, he sounds like
a very smart young man.

17:31.918 --> 17:33.586
And Sabrina,
no matter what

17:33.586 --> 17:34.353
you decide to do,

17:34.353 --> 17:36.422
it's not the end of the world,
believe me.

17:36.422 --> 17:37.890
I've been to the end
of the world.

17:37.890 --> 17:38.891
This isn't it.

17:38.891 --> 17:42.028
You two are the best.

17:42.595 --> 17:45.231
All right, go tell everyone
I'll be there in two minutes.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.432
And this time I mean it.

Sabrina,
if you'd like to begin.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.142
Okay.

18:31.177 --> 18:34.847
I, Sabrina, take you,
Aaron Jacobs...

18:37.550 --> 18:38.584
Sorry.

18:38.584 --> 18:40.086

Oh, um, I, Sabrina Spellman,
take you, Aaron Jacobs,

Do you mind?

19:11.283 --> 19:16.989
So, I'm sensing
a little hesitation
on your part.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.525
You're such
a wonderful guy...

we're not two halves

Sabrina, all I want
is for you to be happy.

19:34.073 --> 19:36.308
But if we're not soul mates,

19:38.744 --> 19:40.980
maybe we shouldn't
be doing this.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.449
Aaron, I am so sorry.

19:43.449 --> 19:45.951
No. Don't be.

Never think that almost
is good enough for you.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.426
