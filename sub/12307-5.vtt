A LITTLE STEAM.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.894
AND RATHER THAN
DWELLING ON THE PAST,

12:03.894 --> 12:05.896
I THINK THE REMEDY FOR US

12:05.896 --> 12:08.498
WOULD BE
TO FIND SOME COMMON GROUND.

TAKING BACK CONTROL
OF HER LIFE.

18:28.738 --> 18:31.881
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT LYDIA WAS
A PATIENT OF DR. BANKS.

18:31.881 --> 18:33.583
WELL, WHY WOULD YOU?

18:33.583 --> 18:35.245
SHE WAS
ONE OF THE ONLY PEOPLE

18:35.245 --> 18:36.746
WHOSE SESSIONS
WEREN'T EXPOSED.

18:45.495 --> 18:47.257

19:05.845 --> 19:08.618

19:08.618 --> 19:10.520

19:10.520 --> 19:13.423
UNTIL I FINALLY ACCEPTED
THAT YOU HAD STOOD ME UP.

19:13.423 --> 19:16.626
YOUR CHAIR DIDN'T LOOK
SO EMPTY TO ME.

19:16.626 --> 19:18.688

AND HE WAS HUNGRY.

19:29.369 --> 19:32.842
I DIDN'T WANT THE FOOD
TO GO TO WASTE.

19:32.842 --> 19:34.804
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.
(chuckles)

19:34.804 --> 19:36.806
YEAH, A LITTLE BIT.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.581
YOU KNOW, I WAS SUPPOSED
TO START WORKING

19:41.581 --> 19:43.683
FOR MY DAD TODAY,
BUT COULDN'T DO IT.

19:43.683 --> 19:44.714
WHY NOT?

19:44.714 --> 19:46.916
BECAUSE HE'S
A PHILANDERING DIRTBAG.

19:46.916 --> 19:48.358
AND IF I CAN'T LOOK AT HIM,

19:48.358 --> 19:49.589
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO WORK FOR HIM?

19:49.589 --> 19:50.720
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT USING

19:50.720 --> 19:52.522
THE FACT THAT HE'S
A PHILANDERING DIRTBAG

FOR WHAT HE REALLY IS.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.902

HE NOW SEES ME

20:02.902 --> 20:04.604

22:20.670 --> 22:22.542
RATHER THAN
MAKING THIS HARDER,

22:22.542 --> 22:24.814
YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK
ABOUT FACILITATING

22:24.814 --> 22:26.416
A DETENTE FOR THE TWO OF US.

22:26.416 --> 22:28.418
A DETENTE...

22:28.418 --> 22:31.851
BETWEEN MY MISTRESS
AND MY WIFE? (laughs)

22:31.851 --> 22:33.583
IF I'M GONNA GET MY LIFE BACK,

22:33.583 --> 22:35.985
THEN I NEED VICTORIA
TO ACCEPT ME.

22:35.985 --> 22:37.557
AND I CAN'T THINK OF
A BETTER PLACE

22:37.557 --> 22:39.889

OTHERWISE--

22:43.463 --> 22:44.934
OTHERWISE WHAT...

22:44.934 --> 22:46.766

24:03.212 --> 24:04.574
LYDIA DOESN'T WANT MONEY
ANYMORE.

24:04.574 --> 24:05.845
THE ONLY THING
THAT'LL PLACATE HER

24:05.845 --> 24:07.617
IS IF VICTORIA WELCOMES HER
BACK INTO THE FOLD.

24:07.617 --> 24:10.019
I AM NOT WELCOMING
THAT SCHEMING HARLOT ANYWHERE

24:10.019 --> 24:11.781

ALL OUR OPTIONS.

24:11.781 --> 24:12.752

24:12.752 --> 24:14.924
MORE AGGRESSIVE WAYS
TO HANDLE THE SITUATION.

24:14.924 --> 24:16.055
HOLD ON A MINUTE.

24:16.055 --> 24:18.758
SHE'S A LONELY SOCIALITE.
SHE'S NOT AN AX MURDERER.

24:18.758 --> 24:20.930
DID SHE OR DID SHE NOT
THREATEN TO TAKE YOU DOWN

24:20.930 --> 24:23.533
AT THE BENEFIT TONIGHT?

24:23.533 --> 24:25.735
YEAH, SHE DANCED AROUND IT.

24:25.735 --> 24:28.037
LOOK, VICTORIA, YOU ASKED ME
TO CALL HER BLUFF ONCE.

24:28.037 --> 24:29.769
I SAY WE DO IT TONIGHT.

24:29.769 --> 24:31.070
WELL, THAT WAS
BEFORE I FOUND OUT

24:31.070 --> 24:32.802
HOW COMPLETELY UNHINGED
SHE'S BECOME.

24:32.802 --> 24:36.075
LYDIA WAS A PATIENT
OF DR. BANKS,

24:36.075 --> 24:39.478
AND HER TAPES WERE THE ONLY ONES
THAT WEREN'T LEAKED.

24:39.478 --> 24:40.950
YOU THINK SHE WAS
BEHIND THE KIDNAPPING?

24:40.950 --> 24:43.182
WHO KNOWS
WHAT THAT WOMAN'S CAPABLE OF?

24:43.182 --> 24:44.483
SHE COULD BE
BEHIND EVERYTHING.

24:44.483 --> 24:45.785
I'LL GET INTO IT.

24:45.785 --> 24:47.957
BUT IF VICTORIA'S SUSPICIONS
ARE RIGHT,

24:47.957 --> 24:49.989
WE HANDLE THIS MY WAY.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.191

THE KEYS TO HER PLACE?

TALKING ABOUT?

FROM A GRAYSON PARTY.

25:28.828 --> 25:29.999

ALL OF THIS?

25:32.602 --> 25:34.233
UM...

25:34.233 --> 25:35.935

YOUR HOUSE.

25:35.935 --> 25:36.936
YOU WHAT?

25:36.936 --> 25:38.237
WELL,
I-I PROMISED YOUR FATHER

25:38.237 --> 25:40.109
THAT I WOULD LOOK AFTER YOU.

25:40.109 --> 25:41.671
I MEAN, LOOK...

25:41.671 --> 25:43.943
YOU PRACTICALLY THROW ME OUT
EVERY TIME I'M HERE,

25:43.943 --> 25:46.916
SO IT WAS THE BEST WAY
I KNEW HOW, AND...

25:46.916 --> 25:49.619
I DON'T KNOW HOW THE CAMERA
ENDED UP AT LYDIA'S.

25:49.619 --> 25:52.752
IT'S PROBABLY 'CAUSE
I SHIPPED IT TO HER.

25:52.752 --> 25:54.083
WE HAVE TO GET OUR HANDS
ON THAT PHOTOGRAPH.

25:54.083 --> 25:56.085
WHY? WHAT HAS SHE
STUMBLED ON TO?

25:56.085 --> 25:58.688
A FEW MONTHS AFTER I WAS
RELEASED FROM JUVIE,

25:58.688 --> 26:00.690
I CATERED A NEW YEAR'S EVE
PARTY FOR GRAYSON GLOBAL.

26:00.690 --> 26:02.992
I WANTED TO SEE FOR MYSELF
WHO THOSE PEOPLE WERE.

26:02.992 --> 26:04.193
OH.

26:04.193 --> 26:06.295
I'M SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T
GO ALL NINJA ON THEM

26:06.295 --> 26:08.668

26:30.920 --> 26:34.263

THAT PARTY, NOLAN.
