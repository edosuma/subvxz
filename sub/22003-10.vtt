-Where's, ah, where's my tablet?

00:34.458 --> 00:36.583
I had a tablet right here.
Where is it?

00:36.625 --> 00:38.750
-A guy in a ski mask came
in and took it.

00:38.792 --> 00:41.083
-You're telling me a man with
a ski mask came in...

00:41.125 --> 00:43.333
Right in front of you and
took my tablet?

00:43.375 --> 00:45.500
-That's exactly what we're
saying.

00:45.542 --> 00:47.709

We're seven years old!

there's twenty-one of you.

00:52.333 --> 00:54.500
-Power in numbers.
-I thought he was your friend.

00:54.542 --> 00:57.542
-Why would you think a man in
a ski mask was my friend?

00:57.583 --> 01:00.250
-Maybe he didn't want anyone to
know he was your friend.

-We don't admit to anyone
you're our teacher.

-Shots fired, Phillip. Why would
you hurt me like that?

a rash of thefts recently.

-May I? We're working on
finding the suspect.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.709
But in the meantime,
we must remain vigilant.

-Are you gonna, like, run after
someone if they steal it?

-Stop.
-No ID, no entry.

next...
