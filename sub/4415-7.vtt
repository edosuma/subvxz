WEBVTT

00:00.097 --> 00:01.797
(dog barking)

00:01.804 --> 00:03.804
<i>From the tip of your toe</i>

00:03.805 --> 00:05.206
<i>through the crown</i>

00:05.290 --> 00:06.507
of your head,

00:06.791 --> 00:09.927
feel the energy flow.

00:10.312 --> 00:11.611
Ignore the distractions
of the world.

00:11.645 --> 00:13.346
(door opens)
Hey.

00:13.381 --> 00:14.381
Oh, no, no.

00:14.415 --> 00:16.049
I was almost asleep.

00:16.082 --> 00:17.317
I know.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.584
...fill you with energy...

00:18.619 --> 00:20.020
I could use a nap, too.

00:20.054 --> 00:22.088
(sighs)

00:22.123 --> 00:23.423
...and exhale.

00:23.457 --> 00:24.590
Ah!

00:24.625 --> 00:26.326
How great is it back here?

00:26.360 --> 00:27.394
No tenant.

00:27.428 --> 00:28.394
No kids.

00:28.428 --> 00:29.495
No laundry.

00:29.529 --> 00:30.762
It's paradise.

00:30.796 --> 00:32.264
This could be the beginning

00:32.298 --> 00:33.999
of a whole new
phase of our lives.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.768
The guest house years.

00:36.802 --> 00:38.537
Hmm...

00:38.571 --> 00:40.605
What if we pretend that,
like, we were teenagers...

00:40.640 --> 00:42.074
(moans)
(chuckles)

00:42.108 --> 00:44.510
...and our parents
lived in the main house.

00:44.544 --> 00:45.876
Mm-hmm.

00:45.911 --> 00:48.346
And they might come in
at any moment.

00:48.380 --> 00:50.948
So we have to do it
really quickly.

00:50.982 --> 00:52.716
LINA: <i>I'm not finishing
my class, am I?</i>

00:52.751 --> 00:53.617
RUSS:
<i>No.</i>

00:53.652 --> 00:56.354
(kissing)

00:57.322 --> 00:58.656
I hear them.

00:58.690 --> 00:59.957
Who?

00:59.991 --> 01:00.758
Your parents.

01:00.792 --> 01:02.859
- Really?
-Yeah.

01:02.893 --> 01:04.593
Are you sure
it's not your mother?

01:04.628 --> 01:06.196
No, it's not my mother.

01:06.230 --> 01:07.531
- Really?
- It's your parents.

01:07.565 --> 01:08.998
I think I can hear
your mom's heels

01:09.033 --> 01:10.500
on the wood floor.

01:10.535 --> 01:11.768
No, it's your parents.

01:11.802 --> 01:13.203
- I think I can hear your mom...
- Stop.

01:13.237 --> 01:14.337
...lighting a cigarette.

01:14.372 --> 01:15.605
Damn it!
(laughing)

01:15.639 --> 01:16.673
That's not cool, okay?

01:16.707 --> 01:17.907
It's not hot at all.

01:18.141 --> 01:20.543
You can finish your class.

01:20.577 --> 01:22.644
Mmm, mission accomplished.

01:23.517 --> 01:24.705
(door closes)

01:24.729 --> 01:28.529
<font color="#FF8C00">Sync by Alice</font>
<font color="#FF8C00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:28.986 --> 01:30.954
So, we are celebrating, guys.

01:34.691 --> 01:37.592
I did a good deed.

01:40.596 --> 01:42.263
Nobody's gonna ask me
what my good deed was?

01:42.298 --> 01:44.599
Pretty sure we're gonna get
that information either way.

01:44.633 --> 01:46.134
Mmm.

01:46.168 --> 01:48.769
I'm helping a Webcam girl
get off the cam.

01:48.804 --> 01:50.438
I don't understand.

01:50.522 --> 01:53.090
Well, you know those girls
who help fellas enjoy the Internet?

01:53.124 --> 01:54.424
I know what a Webcam girl is.

01:54.459 --> 01:56.293
What do you mean
you "helped her off the cam"?

01:56.328 --> 01:57.962
I'm paying for her education.

01:57.996 --> 02:00.264
Oh, in exchange
for sorority cam.

02:00.298 --> 02:01.131
Nice.

02:01.166 --> 02:02.233
No.

02:02.517 --> 02:04.351
She wants to work
with deaf kids.

02:04.935 --> 02:07.304
She may look like a dirty bird,
but underneath

02:07.339 --> 02:09.372
that rocking bod
is a sweet little angel.

02:09.907 --> 02:13.343
How do you manage
to make charity seem creepy?

02:13.377 --> 02:14.410
There's nothing
creepy about it.

02:14.444 --> 02:16.312
I am trying
to help women be happy.

02:16.347 --> 02:18.147
Oh, good luck with that.

02:18.182 --> 02:20.250
What's with him?
What did you do?

02:20.284 --> 02:21.684
Did you finally
break my friend here?

02:21.718 --> 02:23.519
This has nothing
to do with me.

02:24.053 --> 02:25.421
This is about his mother.

02:25.455 --> 02:27.555
She's coming to stay
with us for a couple nights.

02:27.590 --> 02:29.291
(laughs):
Oh, Sharon, huh?

02:29.725 --> 02:30.759
Too bad I'm sober.

02:30.793 --> 02:32.460
She knows how to party.

02:32.495 --> 02:34.296
I'm not sober.

02:34.330 --> 02:36.064
Yeah, well, for Russ,
the party ended a long time ago.

02:36.099 --> 02:37.632
RUSS: I'm just not
my best around her.

02:37.666 --> 02:39.901
It's only two nights.

02:39.935 --> 02:41.436
Yeah, but who knows?

02:41.470 --> 02:43.305
I mean, you never get
a straight answer with her.

02:43.339 --> 02:45.873
We just got to make it through
the weekend without any drama.

02:46.208 --> 02:47.208
Is that all we have to do?

02:47.242 --> 02:49.710
(mouth full):
Mm-hmm.

02:51.744 --> 02:52.846
LINA:
<i>Take that.</i>

02:52.930 --> 02:53.964
They look expensive.

02:53.998 --> 02:55.032
If Grandma sees it,

02:55.066 --> 02:56.634
she might ask for money.

02:56.668 --> 02:58.469
Take this wine,

02:58.503 --> 03:00.371
put it in my closet
with the rest, okay?

03:00.405 --> 03:02.539
Why do we hide things
from Grandma?

03:02.573 --> 03:04.940
Sometimes Grandma thinks
staying with us is a party.

03:04.975 --> 03:06.676
And she...

03:06.710 --> 03:08.911
likes a goodie bag.

03:11.549 --> 03:13.616
- Don't mention the guest house.
- Are you kidding me?

03:13.651 --> 03:15.017
She'd never leave.

03:15.552 --> 03:17.119
- Are you okay?
- No.

03:17.154 --> 03:18.720
Look, it's a few days.

03:18.754 --> 03:19.954
And then she leaves
for her cruise.

03:19.989 --> 03:21.990
We just need to feed her,
get her drunk.

03:22.024 --> 03:23.325
It'll be fine.

03:23.859 --> 03:25.359
(doorbell rings)

03:26.563 --> 03:28.029
GIRLS:
Grandma!

03:28.064 --> 03:30.365
Hi, you little maniacs.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.568
(smooching)

03:32.602 --> 03:34.069
Oh, there you are.

03:34.103 --> 03:35.670
There's my handsome son.

03:35.704 --> 03:36.737
Come on.

03:36.771 --> 03:37.738
Tell your mommy you love her.

03:37.772 --> 03:40.074
I love you.

03:40.108 --> 03:41.842
Aw.

03:41.876 --> 03:43.444
Oh! Thank you.

03:43.478 --> 03:45.213
- Hi, Sharon.
- Hi.

03:45.247 --> 03:46.780
How's my favorite
daughter-in-law?

03:46.815 --> 03:48.182
(chuckles)
Good, really good.

03:48.717 --> 03:51.785
I thought you said
you had a nicer house.

03:51.820 --> 03:53.886
We, we do.

03:53.921 --> 03:55.622
But it's still in the Valley.

03:55.656 --> 03:56.690
That's where people live.

03:56.724 --> 03:58.024
No, no.
No, people don't

03:58.058 --> 03:59.792
"live" in the Valley;
they exist.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:14.874 --> 04:16.709
What's going on?
Are playing or not?

04:16.743 --> 04:18.877
(sighs)

04:19.161 --> 04:21.697
I can't.
Too depressed.

04:21.731 --> 04:23.765
Remember that Webcam girl
I was telling you about?

04:23.800 --> 04:24.933
Sure.

04:24.968 --> 04:27.301
She's back on the cam.

04:27.585 --> 04:29.120
So?

04:29.154 --> 04:31.188
"So?"

04:31.223 --> 04:33.357
I registered her for classes.

04:33.391 --> 04:34.524
I bought her textbooks.

04:34.559 --> 04:35.760
I even gave her a stipend.

04:35.794 --> 04:38.295
At least she's in school.

04:38.329 --> 04:39.363
Well, that's the thing.

04:39.397 --> 04:41.165
She didn't even
show up for class.

04:41.199 --> 04:42.733
(wry laugh)

04:42.768 --> 04:43.984
What the hell?

04:44.018 --> 04:46.052
When she told me that she wanted
to work with deaf kids,

04:46.086 --> 04:47.687
I actually believed her.

04:47.972 --> 04:49.505
(sighs)

04:49.539 --> 04:51.641
The Internet's a web of lies.

04:51.675 --> 04:54.510
I was so proud of myself.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.646
For the first time
since I was fired,

04:56.680 --> 04:59.082
I felt like I was doing
something positive.

04:59.116 --> 05:01.716
I felt like
I was improving the world.

05:01.751 --> 05:03.351
Now...

05:03.386 --> 05:05.954
(quiet laugh)

05:05.989 --> 05:08.223
she's back on the cam.

05:08.258 --> 05:09.591
Hey.

05:09.625 --> 05:11.559
Could you give me this
woman's information?

05:11.594 --> 05:14.396
I'd like to give her
a piece of my mind.

05:14.430 --> 05:17.632
I don't like seeing
you like this.

05:17.716 --> 05:20.585
SHARON:
<i>Oh, Jesus, what a shithole!</i>

05:20.619 --> 05:22.587
Come on, let's
get it cleaned up.

05:22.621 --> 05:24.556
Oh! Does your mother
even know how to dust?

05:24.590 --> 05:26.157
LINA:
I'm right here.

05:26.191 --> 05:28.159
How much was this painting?

05:28.193 --> 05:30.327
I don't remember.

05:30.362 --> 05:31.792
Well, whatever you paid,
you paid too much.

05:31.814 --> 05:33.848
Mom, where are you pants?

05:33.882 --> 05:35.649
It's okay.

05:35.684 --> 05:37.250
I'm wearing my underpants.

05:37.285 --> 05:38.752
No, it's not okay.

05:38.787 --> 05:39.820
I-I think what Russ means

05:39.854 --> 05:41.855
is that he'd feel
more comfortable

05:41.889 --> 05:43.657
if-if you wore pants
around the house.

05:43.692 --> 05:45.992
Oh, is that what he wants?

05:46.027 --> 05:47.695
That's what he wants.

05:47.729 --> 05:49.196
Then he can speak for himself.

05:49.230 --> 05:50.964
I want you to wear pants.

05:50.998 --> 05:52.498
Don't be such a Republican.

05:52.533 --> 05:54.066
Pants are "Republican"?

05:54.100 --> 05:55.802
I think pants are bipartisan.

05:55.836 --> 05:56.969
Fine.

05:57.253 --> 06:00.255
Tell Mohammed
I'll put on my burka.

06:02.392 --> 06:03.993
(scoffs)

06:04.027 --> 06:05.695
(door closes)

06:05.729 --> 06:07.029
Why did you start with her?

06:07.064 --> 06:08.363
Are you kidding?

06:08.398 --> 06:10.098
I'm supposed to let her
walk around the house

06:10.132 --> 06:11.199
in her panties?

06:11.233 --> 06:12.266
Two days.

06:12.301 --> 06:13.501
Then she goes on her cruise,

06:13.535 --> 06:15.536
then she flies back to Cleveland

06:15.571 --> 06:17.105
and then she goes back
to being your sister's problem.

06:17.139 --> 06:19.774
I know, but I'm
not gonna make it.

06:19.809 --> 06:21.142
Fine.

06:21.176 --> 06:23.979
I'll keep you separated.

06:24.263 --> 06:26.230
Sharon?

06:26.264 --> 06:28.532
Can I take you shopping?

06:28.617 --> 06:30.785
SHARON:
Finally!

06:30.869 --> 06:33.003
This won't be cheap.

06:33.921 --> 06:35.623
Buy her some pants.

06:39.499 --> 06:41.400
Are you excited about Mexico?

06:42.484 --> 06:45.085
I'm excited about
not paying for it.

06:45.370 --> 06:47.704
Wow, Tina's treating?
That's nice of her.

06:47.938 --> 06:50.173
I'm not going with Tina.

06:50.507 --> 06:51.975
Russ said that, um...

06:52.009 --> 06:53.476
Well, that's what I told him.

06:53.510 --> 06:56.279
He doesn't like to hear
about my love life.

07:00.417 --> 07:01.484
Wow.

07:01.518 --> 07:02.719
What do you think?

07:03.253 --> 07:05.688
Who are you going
on this cruise with?

07:05.722 --> 07:07.523
An interested senior
I met on the Internet.

07:09.357 --> 07:10.392
Oh...

07:10.426 --> 07:12.728
So what's your verdict
on the teddy?

07:12.762 --> 07:14.429
Is he getting
his money's worth?

07:14.463 --> 07:15.263
I don't know.

07:15.798 --> 07:18.033
How much is the cruise?

07:18.068 --> 07:20.569
The answer is yes, bitch.

07:25.674 --> 07:26.974
(sighs)

07:27.009 --> 07:28.777
RUSS:
<i>So you're going on a cruise</i>

07:28.861 --> 07:31.162
with a man you've
never met before?

07:31.196 --> 07:32.530
Well, we FaceTimed.

07:32.565 --> 07:34.165
But it wasn't just faces.
(laughs)

07:34.199 --> 07:35.500
Oh, gross, Mom.

07:35.534 --> 07:38.002
What do you even
know about this guy?

07:38.036 --> 07:39.636
I know that he's very generous.

07:40.171 --> 07:42.405
Unlike my son
and daughter-in-law.

07:42.440 --> 07:45.342
Those cheeses weren't cheap.

07:45.376 --> 07:46.977
Neither was the teddy.

07:47.411 --> 07:49.079
What teddy?

07:49.413 --> 07:50.647
Never mind.

07:50.782 --> 07:52.649
Does Kimmy know that
you're going on this trip

07:52.684 --> 07:54.150
with a man that
you've never met?

07:54.185 --> 07:55.385
I'm done with your sister.

07:55.419 --> 07:57.386
I am never going
back to Cleve-bland.

07:57.420 --> 07:58.420
I see.

07:58.421 --> 07:59.956
So then, what happens?

07:59.990 --> 08:01.056
- Where do you go after the cruise?
- Oh.

08:01.091 --> 08:02.191
The interested senior

08:02.225 --> 08:03.893
has some property in La Jolla.

08:03.927 --> 08:05.227
Maybe I'll end up there.

08:05.261 --> 08:06.963
That doesn't make any sense.

08:06.997 --> 08:09.164
Well, it would,
if you saw the teddy.

08:17.188 --> 08:18.788
_

08:27.216 --> 08:28.383
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

08:28.417 --> 08:30.083
Sit down.
I already ordered.

08:30.118 --> 08:31.351
All right.

08:31.386 --> 08:34.488
So I had a little Web
chat with our friend.

08:35.889 --> 08:37.289
- And?
- And, well,

08:37.325 --> 08:40.027
at first, I just pretended
to be a regular pervert.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.129
You know? I asked her to
do some light panty play,

08:42.163 --> 08:44.197
established trust--
pretty smart, right?

08:44.232 --> 08:46.933
Did you ask her
about the deaf school or not?

08:46.967 --> 08:48.568
Yes, I did,
and all of a sudden,

08:48.602 --> 08:51.037
click-- I was blocked.

08:51.071 --> 08:52.605
That's it?

08:52.640 --> 08:54.273
You had me drive
to Valencia for this?

08:54.307 --> 08:56.142
You could've told me
all of that on the phone.

08:56.176 --> 08:57.610
Hang on!

08:57.645 --> 09:00.547
I noticed, on her night stand,
a take-out container:

09:00.581 --> 09:04.282
Tandoori chicken...
from Assam Kitchen.

09:04.316 --> 09:05.350
So what?

09:05.384 --> 09:07.252
I heard a nearby train.

09:07.286 --> 09:09.187
I researched all four locations.

09:09.221 --> 09:11.557
This is the only Assam Kitchen

09:11.591 --> 09:13.792
near train tracks.

09:15.326 --> 09:17.529
Your plan is to sit here

09:18.264 --> 09:20.465
until she comes
back to this restaurant

09:20.499 --> 09:23.500
and orders more tandoori?

09:26.337 --> 09:27.705
Oh, well.

09:28.039 --> 09:30.040
We tried.

09:30.275 --> 09:33.310
You can't,
can't save everyone.

09:33.644 --> 09:35.946
Wait a second.

09:35.980 --> 09:37.915
I think I know how to do this.

09:47.857 --> 09:48.959
Guys?

09:48.993 --> 09:50.193
We're trying to save a life.

09:50.227 --> 09:51.761
And help the deaf,

09:51.796 --> 09:53.262
so it's a two-fer.

09:54.297 --> 09:55.831
I'm not home.
AJ: No, no, no, no.

09:55.865 --> 09:57.365
We need a third.

09:57.400 --> 09:58.767
Of course you do.

09:58.802 --> 10:00.302
Yeah?

10:03.572 --> 10:04.807
RUSS:
<i>My mom's plan</i>

10:04.841 --> 10:06.642
is to bone an old stranger

10:06.676 --> 10:08.077
until he invites her
to live with him.

10:08.111 --> 10:09.578
Do you have a better plan?

10:09.613 --> 10:11.213
Yeah.

10:11.247 --> 10:13.481
Ether, duct tape,
shallow grave in the desert...

10:13.515 --> 10:15.149
SHARON:
Oh, there you are.

10:15.183 --> 10:16.884
What's for dinner?

10:16.919 --> 10:19.253
Well, I made tater tots and
chicken nuggets for the kids.

10:19.287 --> 10:21.255
What is this, Friendly's?
RUSS: Mom...

10:21.289 --> 10:23.524
Not okay.
You're a guest.

10:23.558 --> 10:25.359
You're the host?

10:25.793 --> 10:26.828
Lina,

10:26.862 --> 10:28.229
can you take me
to Crate & Barrel?

10:28.263 --> 10:29.830
I need some new pots.

10:29.864 --> 10:31.064
For the cruise?

10:32.266 --> 10:33.333
Forget it; I cancelled it.

10:33.367 --> 10:35.102
What? Why?

10:35.136 --> 10:38.338
Ah... guy called me up
and asked for my credit card

10:38.372 --> 10:39.640
to cover my incidentals.

10:39.674 --> 10:41.474
So you're not going?

10:41.509 --> 10:44.111
Nobody tells me how many
margaritas to order.

10:44.145 --> 10:46.145
Who does he think he is,
your father?

10:46.179 --> 10:47.780
Oh, wow.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.115
Wow!

10:49.149 --> 10:50.716
I see what this is.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.417
I'm such an idiot.

10:52.452 --> 10:53.819
What?

10:53.854 --> 10:55.221
I was worried about you.

10:55.256 --> 10:57.823
But that's...
what you wanted, right?

10:57.858 --> 10:58.924
That was the plan?

10:58.959 --> 11:00.860
To have me

11:01.144 --> 11:02.411
get super-concerned and worried

11:02.445 --> 11:04.946
so that I would beg you
not to go on the trip.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.865
Right?

11:06.899 --> 11:07.999
Was there ever a cruise, Mom?

11:08.534 --> 11:10.334
Was there ever
an interested senior?

11:10.369 --> 11:12.303
You don't think I'm hot enough

11:12.337 --> 11:14.338
to get a cruise paid for?

11:16.408 --> 11:17.942
(phone chimes, whistles)
Here, look.

11:17.977 --> 11:19.677
Oh, my God, Mom!

11:19.761 --> 11:21.028
SHARON:
Now do you believe me?

11:21.062 --> 11:23.297
That could be any
old guy's dick.

11:23.331 --> 11:25.299
Seriously? You really think
that I would go out

11:25.333 --> 11:28.168
and steal a picture
of any old guy's dick

11:28.202 --> 11:29.537
just so I could live here

11:29.571 --> 11:32.139
with my asshole son
and his joyless wife?

11:32.173 --> 11:34.341
Yep.
Yeah, I do, actually.

11:34.375 --> 11:36.643
I would never live
in the Valley.

11:36.677 --> 11:38.878
Now, if you had
a home in Malibu,

11:38.913 --> 11:41.113
it'd be a different story.

11:44.752 --> 11:46.018
(door slams)

11:46.053 --> 11:48.154
"Joyless."

11:51.241 --> 11:51.841
<i>Okay,</i>

11:51.866 --> 11:53.341
so is this the credit
card you want to use

11:53.366 --> 11:54.665
or do you have
a separate card

11:54.700 --> 11:55.780
that you just use for porn?

11:56.301 --> 11:58.402
No? Okay.
I'll use this one.

11:58.436 --> 12:00.905
All right, guys, you got
20 minutes to save this woman

12:00.939 --> 12:03.640
and then I have
things to do, okay?

12:03.674 --> 12:04.708
(doorbell rings)

12:04.992 --> 12:06.693
That must be Raavi.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.229
Who's Raavi?

12:08.313 --> 12:09.546
My secret weapon.

12:09.580 --> 12:11.748
I thought I was
the secret weapon.

12:11.783 --> 12:13.817
What, a guy can't have more
than one secret weapon?

12:13.851 --> 12:15.351

12:28.365 --> 12:31.266
Homemade sausages.

12:31.301 --> 12:32.968

12:39.575 --> 12:41.944
She wants to move in.

12:41.978 --> 12:44.712
How long you think our marriage
lasts, once she does?

12:44.997 --> 12:46.764
Three months?

12:46.799 --> 12:48.899
Maybe six, with counseling.

12:48.933 --> 12:50.834
You bought fennel.

12:50.868 --> 12:52.002
Yeah.

12:52.036 --> 12:53.036
Like you asked.

12:53.037 --> 12:54.805
I asked her for fennel seeds

12:54.839 --> 12:56.073
and she brought home
an actual fennel.

12:56.107 --> 12:58.275
Is there something
wrong with your wife?

12:58.310 --> 13:00.077
All right.

13:00.111 --> 13:03.080
Mom, I think we need to talk.

13:03.364 --> 13:06.866
And why are you taking me
to the garage?

13:06.900 --> 13:09.034
It's actually a guest house.

13:10.471 --> 13:11.871
You have a guest house?

13:11.905 --> 13:14.740
Well, we're in the
process of converting it.

13:17.378 --> 13:20.012
So there's a bedroom here,

13:20.046 --> 13:22.114
- Mm-hmm.
- and the bathroom.

13:22.149 --> 13:23.382
Yeah. Okay.

13:23.416 --> 13:25.884
And, um, and this is
kind of like

13:25.918 --> 13:28.453
the main, uh,
main living area.

13:28.488 --> 13:30.121
Hey. Well, I...

13:30.156 --> 13:32.891
I could do wonders
with this place.

13:32.925 --> 13:35.527
Of course, your wife will fill
it with cheap shit, but, uh...

13:35.561 --> 13:38.196
You can decorate it... yourself.

13:38.230 --> 13:39.730
However you want.

13:41.500 --> 13:42.733
I don't understand.

13:42.768 --> 13:44.868
You can live here.

13:44.903 --> 13:47.137
For as long as you need to.

13:47.172 --> 13:49.239
Look, just until

13:49.274 --> 13:51.309
you get a job, right?
Get back on your feet again.

13:51.343 --> 13:52.643
(laughs)
I have a job.

13:52.678 --> 13:54.077
Yeah. Selling old bags on eBay

13:54.112 --> 13:55.179
is not really a job.

13:55.213 --> 13:57.013
I have made thousands.

13:57.047 --> 13:59.081
It's still not a job.

14:01.319 --> 14:03.119
I know that things aren't

14:03.153 --> 14:06.055
probably the way you imagined

14:06.089 --> 14:07.524
they would be, you know?

14:07.558 --> 14:08.958
When you left Dad,

14:08.992 --> 14:11.027
I'm sure you thought...

14:11.061 --> 14:12.696
whatever, that it would be...

14:13.230 --> 14:15.831
This is a very nice guest house

14:15.865 --> 14:17.299
and it's all yours.

14:18.034 --> 14:19.535
It's a garage.

14:20.469 --> 14:22.638
Very hot here
in the Valley...

14:22.672 --> 14:23.905
There's air conditioning.

14:23.940 --> 14:25.641
Everywhere.

14:25.775 --> 14:27.610

18:03.418 --> 18:05.119
I mean, we really
know nothing

18:05.153 --> 18:06.954
about that guy.

18:06.989 --> 18:10.224
Except for that he's got
very interesting skin tags.

18:12.660 --> 18:15.561
Well, what's the worst
that could happen?

18:15.596 --> 18:18.365
That she <i>doesn't</i> get murdered?

18:21.469 --> 18:23.003
Yeah.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.174
(sighs)

18:28.209 --> 18:29.675
Tell me I'm a good boy.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.478
You're okay.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.017
(siren wailing in distance)

18:46.058 --> 18:48.027
Hey.
Want to party?

18:48.561 --> 18:51.162
Better. I want to help
you help yourself.

18:51.196 --> 18:52.897
Whatever. It's gonna
cost you extra.

18:52.931 --> 18:55.099
Hey, it's just money.

18:55.334 --> 18:56.667
I got a friend

18:56.701 --> 18:58.169
that I like to work with.

18:58.403 --> 19:01.305
You want to save two of us
at the same time?

19:02.841 --> 19:04.808
(exhales) Um...

19:04.843 --> 19:07.411
Yeah.
That would be great.
