00:48.715 --> 00:51.128
<i>This is my favorite room.</i>

00:56.932 --> 00:58.389
<i>Most days I love it,</i>

00:58.600 --> 01:02.640
<i>because I can imagine the glass</i>
<i>falling away and I'm outside.</i>

01:55.616 --> 01:57.778
<i>I don't leave my house.</i>

01:57.993 --> 02:01.361
<i>I haven't left my house in 17 years.</i>

02:01.788 --> 02:04.326
<i>If I went outside, I'd die.</i>

02:04.541 --> 02:05.873
<i>Sorry to sound morose.</i>

02:08.461 --> 02:11.421
<i>Irradiators sterilize my clothes.</i>

02:12.924 --> 02:15.712
<i>I own 100 white T-shirts.</i>

02:15.927 --> 02:18.214
<i>It's my standard uniform.</i>

02:19.514 --> 02:22.427
<i>The airlock is a sealed room</i>
<i>surrounding the front door.</i>

02:22.643 --> 02:23.884
<i>It's airtight.</i>

02:24.102 --> 02:26.890
<i>Nothing can leak into</i>
<i>the house when the door's open.</i>

02:27.648 --> 02:30.015
<i>It's not that I don't want to go outside.</i>

02:30.233 --> 02:31.223
<i>I can't.</i>

02:31.443 --> 02:35.483
<i>Simple viruses can kill me.</i>
<i>It's like I'm allergic to everything.</i>

02:35.697 --> 02:39.407
<i>What I eat, what I touch,</i>
<i>they all have consequences.</i>

02:40.243 --> 02:42.735
<i>I have severe combined immunodeficiency.</i>

02:43.080 --> 02:44.161
<i>My immune system sucks.</i>

02:45.165 --> 02:46.747
<i>Here's a drawing to explain.</i>

02:46.917 --> 02:50.081
<i>In every drop of blood there are</i>
<i>special cells called lymphocytes.</i>

02:50.295 --> 02:51.285
Hello.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.839
<i>Some of these lymphocytes</i>
<i>are really good at fighting bad guys,</i>

02:55.050 --> 02:57.258
<i>like viruses and bacteria.</i>

02:57.469 --> 03:01.094
<i>But I have SCID, which means I have
way fewer lymphocytes than normal.</i>

03:01.264 --> 03:02.550
Uh-oh.

03:02.724 --> 03:05.299
<i>And the ones that I do have,</i>

03:05.477 --> 03:07.389
<i>well, they're not so good at fighting.</i>

03:09.398 --> 03:11.731
<i>My mom made me join a support group.</i>

03:12.693 --> 03:14.935
<i>Some of them are really sick.</i>

03:15.153 --> 03:17.770
<i>Others have a hard time</i>
<i>with social interactions.</i>

03:19.491 --> 03:20.527
<i>At least I have the Internet.</i>

03:24.204 --> 03:25.570
<i>I exercise.</i>

03:25.789 --> 03:27.325
<i>I read a lot of books.</i>

03:28.291 --> 03:29.782
<i>When I'm done, I write short reviews.</i>

03:40.512 --> 03:43.004
<i>I take an architecture class online.</i>

03:43.890 --> 03:47.509
<i>Whenever I make a new model,</i>
<i>I put an astronaut inside.</i>

03:48.937 --> 03:50.599
<i>I can relate to him.</i>

03:51.148 --> 03:54.357
<i>I feel like an astronaut, stranded in space.</i>

04:04.411 --> 04:07.154
<i>Every day feels exactly the same.</i>

04:16.757 --> 04:18.418
<i>Maybe today's different.</i>

04:19.341 --> 04:20.423
Get off the truck, Olly.

04:41.740 --> 04:42.981
Hi.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.750
<i>If you're going to have an illness</i>

05:02.969 --> 05:06.383
<i>that requires someone to constantly</i>
<i>watch if you're still breathing,</i>

05:06.598 --> 05:08.885
<i>it's convenient for</i>
<i>your mother to be a doctor.</i>

05:10.519 --> 05:13.102
<i>I was diagnosed with SCID pretty early.</i>

05:13.855 --> 05:16.438
<i>My mom figured out what was wrong</i>
<i>with me after eight ear infections</i>

05:16.650 --> 05:17.891
<i>and two cases of pneumonia.</i>

05:19.069 --> 05:20.526
<i>I couldn't gain any weight as a baby.</i>

05:22.113 --> 05:24.821
<i>Most kids don't make it past two years old.</i>

05:25.909 --> 05:27.025
Doctor Whittier.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.536
<i>Today's my birthday.</i>

05:37.295 --> 05:38.285
<i>I'm 18.</i>

05:42.259 --> 05:44.125
<i>Which means nothing inside here.</i>

05:49.516 --> 05:52.099
<i>This is the face her patients normally see,</i>

05:52.310 --> 05:53.892
<i>slightly distant, concerned.</i>

05:55.438 --> 05:57.725
<i>I wonder if they find it comforting.</i>

05:57.941 --> 05:59.307
<i>I do.</i>

05:59.943 --> 06:01.479
You didn't have to take the day off.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.778
I always take the day off.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.855
What do you want to do today?

06:06.324 --> 06:08.441
Same thing we always do.

06:19.296 --> 06:20.753
Spatlit...

06:21.590 --> 06:22.671
What does that say?

06:22.883 --> 06:25.091
- Spotlight.
- No, it doesn't.

06:25.302 --> 06:26.668
<i>You're not good at phonetic Scrabble.</i>

06:26.887 --> 06:28.674
<i>Because it doesn't make any sense.</i>

06:28.889 --> 06:30.596
You're the one who always wants to play.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.969
It was your dad's favorite game.

06:33.727 --> 06:34.968
Did he beat you, too?

06:35.186 --> 06:36.347
Yeah.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.395
But he let me win sometimes.

06:38.607 --> 06:40.644
<i>- I can't do that.</i>
<i>- Why not?</i>

06:40.859 --> 06:42.475
<i>I'm in love with you.</i>

06:46.156 --> 06:47.317
<i>Snap out of it!</i>

06:47.490 --> 06:48.480
<i>I can't.</i>

06:48.700 --> 06:49.941
I'll get it.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.776
Stay here.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.159
<i>And you won't come to the wedding.</i>

06:56.333 --> 06:57.323
<i>I'll come to the wedding.</i>

06:57.542 --> 06:59.499
<i>I am telling you, you can't come.</i>

07:22.525 --> 07:23.515
Hi.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.815
Um, my mom sent a Bundt. It's not very good.

07:28.531 --> 07:31.695
It's kind of a thing our mom does
every time we move in somewhere.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.446
She'll make us bring one
to the neighbor, so...

07:34.996 --> 07:38.865
It's actually more of, uh, an apology
than an introduction.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.538
What's she apologizing for?

07:41.753 --> 07:43.585
For moving in.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.797
Oh, that's nice.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.795
Actually, I can't accept that.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.046
Why not?

07:54.265 --> 07:55.972
It's complicated.

07:56.184 --> 07:58.642
But please thank your mother for me,

07:58.853 --> 08:01.436
and welcome to the neighborhood.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.606
Is your daughter around?

08:06.444 --> 08:08.276
<i>So, that's why you came.</i>

08:08.488 --> 08:10.275
- That's not why I came.
- <i>Yeah, it is. Yep.</i>

08:10.490 --> 08:11.856
No, she isn't.

08:21.418 --> 08:22.704
You take the Bundt next time.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.581
<i>Oh, right. Wear it as a hat.</i>

08:31.261 --> 08:32.626
Watch it.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.933
<i>Madeline, do you want to finish the movie?</i>

09:23.354 --> 09:26.722
I'd rather know
what a Bundt cake tastes like.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.148
<i>It's dry.</i>

09:28.359 --> 09:30.772
<i>You're not missing out on anything.</i>

09:31.154 --> 09:33.066
No, just everything.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.905
<i>There's a short list of people
that know I'm alive.</i>

09:39.996 --> 09:44.161
<i>My mom, my nurse, Carla,</i>
<i>and her daughter, Rosa.</i>

09:45.752 --> 09:48.665
<i>I can't remember Carla not being with us.</i>

09:49.047 --> 09:51.835
<i>She's been working here for 15 years.</i>

09:52.926 --> 09:56.966
<i>Sometimes, I think she's trapped</i>
<i>inside here with me.</i>

10:08.900 --> 10:10.892
- Morning, Carla.
- Mmm-hmm.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.821
<i>Feliz cumplea√±os.</i>

10:23.998 --> 10:25.955
Thank you!

10:26.209 --> 10:28.075
Thank you so much.

10:30.713 --> 10:31.920
Ooh, <i>una nota.</i>

11:38.031 --> 11:39.488
That's terrible.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.268
Hi, Olly.

13:00.363 --> 13:01.695
Hi, Maddy.

13:12.625 --> 13:16.164
<i>I tell myself I won't text back</i>
<i>immediately when Olly texts me.</i>

13:17.797 --> 13:21.381
<i>And then I text back. Immediately.</i>

13:31.894 --> 13:33.226
Are you on house arrest?

13:33.396 --> 13:34.386
Why do you think I'm on house arrest?

13:34.605 --> 13:36.562
'Cause I haven't seen you outside once
since we got here.

13:36.733 --> 13:37.723
Um...

13:37.900 --> 13:40.108
I'm not on house arrest,
but I can't leave the house.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.561
Very mysterious.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.316
Are you a ghost?

13:43.573 --> 13:46.190
'Cause, it would just my luck that
the girl next door is not actually alive.

13:46.409 --> 13:49.026
I'm, like, 98% sure that I'm alive.

13:49.245 --> 13:50.235
Hmm.

13:50.413 --> 13:52.245
So, what is it? Is it a guy?
Are you knocked up?

13:52.415 --> 13:55.249
Oh, my God. Well, what if I was?

13:56.044 --> 13:57.080
I'd be conflicted.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.418
About what?

13:59.422 --> 14:00.412
Do you have a boyfriend?

14:01.007 --> 14:03.715
No. I don't have a boyfriend,
and I'm not pregnant.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.009
Have you spent all day
thinking that I was pregnant?

14:06.220 --> 14:07.256
Yeah, kind of.

14:07.430 --> 14:10.013
I mean, it would have been awkward
flirting with a pregnant girl, so...

14:10.224 --> 14:12.432
Right.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.723
Don't you wanna know if I have a girlfriend?

14:16.022 --> 14:17.058
No.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.307
I'm hurt.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.266
I mean, that stings.

14:21.736 --> 14:22.852
So, where'd you move here from?

14:23.071 --> 14:24.937
Boston, but I'm from New York.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.613
<i>I wanna move back.</i>

14:29.327 --> 14:32.161
I always imagined myself
working in a bakery in New York.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.989
You know, like Nicolas Cage
in that movie, <i>Moonstruck?</i>

14:35.208 --> 14:36.244
No.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.532
"Snap out of it!"

14:41.172 --> 14:42.413
It's from the movie.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.585
Yeah, I figured.

14:46.094 --> 14:48.177
All right, here's a game.
Fast Five Favorites.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.424
- Okay?
- Okay.

14:49.639 --> 14:53.178
So, book, word, color, vice, person.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.139
Um... Okay. All right. Um...

14:56.437 --> 14:57.427
<i>So, I guess...</i>

14:57.647 --> 14:59.013
Come on. Type faster. Don't think about it.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.144
Okay. All right. <i>The Little Prince.</i>

15:01.359 --> 15:02.645
- Uxorious.
- Ooh.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.601
- Aquamarine.
- Hmm.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.067
I don't have any vices.

15:08.282 --> 15:09.648
And my mom.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.033
Oh, come on. Everyone has vices.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.325
How many vices do you have?

15:12.495 --> 15:13.656
Enough to choose a favorite.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.492
- Your turn.
- All right.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.490
<i>- Lord of the Flies.</i>
- Uh-huh.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.449
- Macabre.
- Okay.

15:19.669 --> 15:20.659
Black.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.494
Uh, petty theft.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.914
And my sister.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.627
<i>Lord of the Flies?</i>

15:26.843 --> 15:28.630
So, you're bleak.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.046
I've been told that I have
a poor outlook on life.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.464
<i>Right.</i>

15:35.476 --> 15:37.183
Are your parents still together?

15:37.687 --> 15:39.269
Um, my dad's dead,

15:39.480 --> 15:40.846
so, no.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.266
Oh.

15:44.485 --> 15:47.523
Whoa, that was really awkward.
I don't know why I made that so...

15:47.738 --> 15:49.855
- I shouldn't have asked.
- No, it's, um...

15:50.032 --> 15:53.241
He died in a car accident with my brother.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.405
I'm sorry.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.877
You don't go to SF Valley High?

16:04.046 --> 16:05.662
No, I don't go to school.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.714
I go online.

16:08.634 --> 16:09.624
Why?

16:10.386 --> 16:11.877
I'm sick.

16:12.388 --> 16:13.674
Oh, are you dying?

16:14.557 --> 16:15.673
Not right now.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.682
Soon?

16:17.894 --> 16:21.137
If I left the house, yeah, probably.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.391
What is it?

16:22.565 --> 16:25.103
It's called severe combined immunodeficiency.

16:25.318 --> 16:29.062
So, it means my body can't fight
bacteria or infections.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.566
Is there a cure?

16:30.781 --> 16:33.114
For common kinds of SCID, yeah.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.069
But I am very uncommon.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.904
You're feeling sorry for me.

16:39.081 --> 16:40.788
You're totally feeling sorry for me.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.286
No, no, no. I, um...

16:42.502 --> 16:43.492
Yeah.

16:43.711 --> 16:44.997
I'm not feeling sorry for you.

16:45.213 --> 16:46.749
- Uh-huh.
- You're alive now.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.255
- You have the Internet.
- Mmm-hmm.

16:48.883 --> 16:51.296
So, I don't feel sorry for you.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.175
Good.

17:00.937 --> 17:03.099
<i>I wish I could meet you in person.</i>

17:04.815 --> 17:06.351
Yeah. Me, too.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.488
Wait, come to the window.

18:20.308 --> 18:22.220
What's so interesting on that laptop?

18:22.435 --> 18:23.767
Um, nothing.

18:24.478 --> 18:25.889
<i>It's not nothing.</i>

18:26.689 --> 18:28.430
Something's making you laugh.

18:28.983 --> 18:30.565
It's just cat videos.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.860
You don't wanna see this one, Carla.

18:38.034 --> 18:40.242
The cat dies.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.241
You're an idiot.

18:47.418 --> 18:48.625
I'm not an idiot.

18:48.836 --> 18:51.795
You are an idiot, and you're not a good liar.

18:54.091 --> 18:57.209
You mean to tell me that the only thing
you could think to say

18:57.428 --> 18:58.885
was that it was a dead cat?

19:01.265 --> 19:03.222
So, you know?

19:04.727 --> 19:06.719
If I didn't know before, I do now.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.889
You're not very good at hiding things.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.354
I see you checking your email
and looking for him out the window.

19:16.697 --> 19:17.687
Maybe he could visit?

19:19.533 --> 19:20.523
<i>Huh.</i>

19:21.369 --> 19:22.905
Teenagers are all the same.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.695
Is that a no?

19:25.873 --> 19:28.286
He'd get decontaminated,
and it would just be for a half hour.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.491
Are you crazy?

19:29.710 --> 19:31.952
Wouldn't you be if you'd been inside
for 18 years?

19:33.297 --> 19:34.287
No.

19:35.049 --> 19:37.757
He'd get decontaminated, and then
he'd sit across the room from me,

19:37.968 --> 19:39.049
like, far, far away.

19:41.764 --> 19:44.051
We can't always get what we want.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.926
<i>Your mother would never let you.</i>

19:47.853 --> 19:49.560
We don't have to tell her.

19:50.648 --> 19:52.765
Is it that easy to lie?

19:52.942 --> 19:54.524
You know, it's easier than I thought.

19:55.569 --> 19:56.559
Huh.

19:58.781 --> 20:02.741
You know what, I'm gonna go home
and look on Rosa's Internet history.

20:08.249 --> 20:09.865
<i>Rosa's the only other person allowed inside,</i>

20:10.084 --> 20:12.371
<i>but she's leaving for Michigan in the fall.</i>

20:12.586 --> 20:15.294
<i>She'll meet new people,</i>
<i>and I'll still be here.</i>

20:15.506 --> 20:16.963
What does he look like?

20:17.383 --> 20:18.373
Rosa.

20:18.634 --> 20:19.624
What?

20:20.302 --> 20:22.339
Okay, I guess he's cute.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.297
I don't believe you.

20:25.683 --> 20:28.517
Yeah, maybe he is a figment
of my imagination.

20:28.978 --> 20:32.892
Just like a really good-looking mirage.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.767
Things are finally getting
interesting for you.

20:36.986 --> 20:37.976
And I'm leaving.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.315
What are you guys talking about?

20:41.532 --> 20:42.568
Nothing.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.157
Come on, Rosa, it's time for us to go home.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.980
<i>Connected to Oliver Bright's iPhone.</i>

21:52.394 --> 21:53.805
I'm right here.

22:38.232 --> 22:40.349
That was way too easy.

23:01.463 --> 23:03.079
Hey, what you looking at?

23:03.299 --> 23:04.460
Nothing.

23:04.633 --> 23:05.623
Is that a new sweater?

23:05.843 --> 23:06.879
Yeah.

23:08.512 --> 23:09.969
Carla irradiated it.

23:10.180 --> 23:11.341
And where'd you get it?

23:11.557 --> 23:12.798
From Rosa.

23:13.934 --> 23:16.051
Mmm, it's nice. You look pretty.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.397
<i>You listen to me.</i>

23:28.616 --> 23:30.949
You stay on your side of the room,

23:31.160 --> 23:32.150
he stay on his.

23:32.912 --> 23:35.199
<i>I already told him the same thing.</i>

23:35.497 --> 23:36.908
What are you talking about?

23:37.333 --> 23:38.869
You stay on your side,

23:39.084 --> 23:40.996
<i>he stays on his.</i>

23:41.170 --> 23:42.502
He's here.

23:43.172 --> 23:44.754
Who's here?

23:45.841 --> 23:46.831
Olly.

23:53.515 --> 23:54.676
Nod if you understand.

23:54.892 --> 23:56.849
I'm worried you're losing your motor skills.

24:01.815 --> 24:02.805
Why?

24:03.192 --> 24:05.149
Because I'm terrible at saying no.

24:06.904 --> 24:08.987
<i>Because you deserve a little something.</i>

24:10.699 --> 24:11.815
Is that what you're gonna wear?

24:34.598 --> 24:35.759
You just gonna stay over there?

24:36.809 --> 24:40.268
Carla said that I had to stay
as far away from you as possible.

24:41.689 --> 24:42.805
Cool.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.191
You're standing really still.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.023
Maybe you should come in.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.067
Yeah. Yeah.

24:55.285 --> 24:56.901
I could do that.

25:21.270 --> 25:23.762
You're really different
than I thought you were gonna be.

25:24.106 --> 25:25.688
I know.

25:26.483 --> 25:27.849
Sexier, right?

25:29.903 --> 25:31.986
I understand, you're nervous.
It's all right, you can admit it.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.278
I am nervous.

25:33.490 --> 25:35.823
All right. Well, so am I.

25:37.828 --> 25:39.990
I like this room.

25:40.622 --> 25:41.738
Yeah.

25:42.458 --> 25:47.294
Um, my mom built it
so that I could feel like I was outside.

25:47.838 --> 25:49.079
Does it work?

25:49.298 --> 25:50.834
Most days.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.042
I have a really excellent imagination.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.802
Princess Madeline in her glass castle.

25:56.346 --> 25:57.678
I'm not a princess.

25:58.474 --> 25:59.555
Good.

26:00.267 --> 26:02.099
Because I'm not a prince.

26:06.273 --> 26:08.481
<i>So, uh, how long have you been sick?</i>

26:08.650 --> 26:09.640
My whole life.

26:10.235 --> 26:13.694
I mean, what would happen
if you went outside?

26:14.156 --> 26:15.943
Probably spontaneous combustion.

26:16.533 --> 26:17.523
We'll stay inside.

26:17.743 --> 26:19.154
Yeah, that's a good idea.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.536
Have you ever left this house?

26:22.498 --> 26:23.534
Uh, no.

26:25.793 --> 26:27.500
Where would you go?

26:28.504 --> 26:29.494
If you could.

26:29.963 --> 26:31.329
The ocean.

26:31.507 --> 26:33.169
The ocean? Why?

26:33.383 --> 26:37.127
Well, it covers 72% of the planet.

26:37.346 --> 26:40.510
And it's approximately 3 miles from here.

26:40.682 --> 26:42.344
And I've never seen it.

26:42.643 --> 26:44.350
It's a bad choice.

26:44.686 --> 26:45.676
Why?

26:46.063 --> 26:47.179
I'm assuming you can't swim.

26:47.981 --> 26:50.064
Yeah, you're right.

26:50.275 --> 26:52.608
But I'd like to try.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.812
I respect the ocean.

26:56.031 --> 27:00.116
I mean, it's beautiful.
It's impersonal, it's murderous.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.202
It's Mother Nature at her finest.

27:03.372 --> 27:04.954
I mean, the point of waves

27:05.165 --> 27:08.203
is to suck your feet out from under you
so that you drown faster.

27:08.627 --> 27:09.743
Right.

27:12.506 --> 27:14.372
Didn't see that dark turn coming.

27:14.716 --> 27:15.957
Yeah, well...

27:30.357 --> 27:31.939
I'm really good at handstands.

27:32.568 --> 27:33.979
Yeah?

27:42.536 --> 27:43.572
What else can you do?

27:43.787 --> 27:45.073
Oh, man.

27:45.247 --> 27:47.864
I'm afraid that's pretty much it.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.685
You didn't touch, right?

28:09.897 --> 28:11.104
No.

28:11.648 --> 28:12.855
No touching.

28:23.076 --> 28:24.567
<i>Your face!</i>

28:24.786 --> 28:26.402
What? Is it red?

28:27.414 --> 28:29.155
I can see it.

28:30.292 --> 28:32.625
You're completely gone
and you barely know him.

28:33.962 --> 28:36.454
I thought you were on our side!

28:36.673 --> 28:38.790
I'm just facilitating.

28:43.388 --> 28:46.381
Do you, um, think I could see him again?

28:47.434 --> 28:48.470
Hmm.

28:49.478 --> 28:52.437
In a week. I wanna make sure you're okay.

28:55.609 --> 28:57.851
What am I supposed to do until then?

28:58.153 --> 28:59.143
Hmm.

29:00.822 --> 29:03.030
When was the last time you posted a review?

29:04.785 --> 29:05.775
Hmm?

29:40.028 --> 29:41.018
Hey, where are you?

29:41.280 --> 29:43.272
<i>Skating in Venice.</i>

29:43.532 --> 29:45.023
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

29:45.701 --> 29:46.862
<i>I'm sorry, Maddy.</i>

29:47.035 --> 29:49.152
No, no, no. You should enjoy that.

29:49.371 --> 29:51.033
For us both.

29:51.873 --> 29:53.705
<i>It's boring without you.</i>

29:53.875 --> 29:55.958
What makes you think
that I'd make it any better?

29:56.169 --> 30:00.288
<i>Well, there are no girls here,</i>
<i>so who am I supposed to show off to?</i>

30:01.967 --> 30:03.674
So, listen, um,

30:03.885 --> 30:06.923
on Tuesday, Carla has the night off,

30:07.139 --> 30:09.802
and my mom's working a double shift,

30:10.017 --> 30:14.261
so I figured maybe you'd come over

30:14.479 --> 30:17.096
and we could watch the fireworks
from the sunroom.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.149
<i>Wait, Tuesday?</i>

30:20.944 --> 30:22.731
<i>That's July Fourth.</i>

30:23.822 --> 30:26.280
Yeah. Do you have plans or something?

30:26.950 --> 30:29.943
<i>No. I'm not very popular.</i>

30:30.412 --> 30:31.698
Lucky for me then, I guess.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.332
So, um, I guess I'll see you then.

30:36.543 --> 30:38.409
<i>All right. I will see you then, Maddy.</i>

30:38.628 --> 30:39.914
Okay, bye, Olly.

30:40.088 --> 30:41.545
<i>Bye.</i>

30:44.843 --> 30:47.426
<i>I don't know how Carla
and I got our wires crossed.</i>

30:47.637 --> 30:50.596
I don't wanna leave you alone tonight.
It's the Fourth of July.

30:51.391 --> 30:53.929
You know, I'll see if someone
can cover for me.

30:54.144 --> 30:55.510
You know, I'll be fine.

30:55.937 --> 30:57.849
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'll be okay.

30:58.106 --> 30:59.096
What are you gonna do?

30:59.733 --> 31:01.975
I guess just read a book or something.

31:10.786 --> 31:13.244
So, calculus is the mathematics of change.

31:13.455 --> 31:17.244
It doesn't necessarily predict the future,
but it does indicate it.

31:17.793 --> 31:18.829
Indicate what?

31:22.798 --> 31:25.336
Well, that people are unpredictable.

31:28.970 --> 31:31.132
I didn't really see you as a math person.

31:33.266 --> 31:34.427
Why not?

31:35.102 --> 31:36.468
I guess 'cause you're in summer school.

31:38.063 --> 31:39.270
Right. Well, that's...

31:40.982 --> 31:42.473
That's just 'cause my dad moves around a lot.

32:06.049 --> 32:07.790
This is an ellipsis.

32:10.053 --> 32:11.715
Does that mean
that we're having an awkward silence

32:11.930 --> 32:13.137
or that you're thinking?

32:14.266 --> 32:15.302
Both.

32:16.852 --> 32:18.013
What are you thinking about?

32:18.854 --> 32:22.689
I'm thinking that we should
probably agree to just be friends.

32:24.025 --> 32:25.641
I don't think
you have that kind of restraint.

32:26.653 --> 32:29.236
Well, my life is
an exercise in restraint, so...

32:32.200 --> 32:33.862
Does this mean
I can't look at your lips anymore?

32:34.703 --> 32:35.739
No.

32:37.747 --> 32:38.737
<i>Your dimple?</i>

32:38.957 --> 32:40.368
I don't have dimples!

32:40.542 --> 32:41.658
Your hair.

32:41.877 --> 32:42.867
Friends!

32:43.044 --> 32:44.410
Ellipsis.

32:52.888 --> 32:54.880
You make me wanna stay in Los Angeles.

32:55.307 --> 32:57.094
Why would you go?

33:08.570 --> 33:10.061
What are you doing?

33:10.238 --> 33:12.150
I'm moving closer to you.

33:15.535 --> 33:16.946
Is that okay?

33:18.079 --> 33:20.071
Yes, it's okay.

33:22.709 --> 33:23.745
Okay.

33:28.256 --> 33:32.296
I should tell you we shouldn't
push our luck, but I can't.

33:34.137 --> 33:35.753
I don't want to.

33:38.975 --> 33:40.432
Are you sure?

33:45.273 --> 33:46.309
Yes.

33:53.615 --> 33:55.231
Hello, Little Prince.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.636
Is it always like that?

34:17.264 --> 34:18.800
It's never like that.

34:41.913 --> 34:44.996
<i>Are you sure you're not sick? You feel fine?</i>

34:45.833 --> 34:47.496
Yeah, I feel fine.

34:48.837 --> 34:52.376
Better than fine, actually.
I feel pretty perfect.

34:53.300 --> 34:55.041
<i>Even though we touched?</i>

34:56.052 --> 34:57.418
We did.

34:57.637 --> 34:59.503
<i>Shared the same breath.</i>

35:00.181 --> 35:02.093
Yeah, we did.

35:02.767 --> 35:03.848
<i>Kissed.</i>

35:05.478 --> 35:08.812
Like I said, perfect.

35:11.526 --> 35:13.358
Hey, goodnight.

35:13.570 --> 35:14.651
<i>Goodnight.</i>

35:15.405 --> 35:19.357
<i>I read once that we change the upper
layers of our skin every two weeks.</i>

35:20.243 --> 35:22.701
<i>But some of our cells don't renew.</i>

35:22.871 --> 35:25.238
<i>They age, and age us.</i>

35:26.207 --> 35:29.075
<i>In two weeks, my lips</i>
<i>will have no memory of kissing Olly.</i>

35:30.086 --> 35:32.794
<i>But my brain will remember.</i>

35:32.964 --> 35:34.796
<i>Yeah, that's right, walk away, Dad.</i>

35:35.008 --> 35:37.298
- <i>Leave it alone, Olly.</i>
- <i>Walk away!</i>

35:37.510 --> 35:38.500
<i>It's not your problem, okay?</i>

35:38.720 --> 35:40.052
<i>It's not my problem? It's not my problem.</i>

35:40.221 --> 35:41.712
<i>You really just say that to me right now?</i>

35:42.015 --> 35:43.005
Stay out of it!

35:43.224 --> 35:44.214
- Stay out of it, huh?
- Yeah.

35:44.434 --> 35:46.266
Stay out of it. How's that?
How's that for staying out of it?

35:46.478 --> 35:48.094
- Really?
- Enough!

36:00.450 --> 36:01.736
Madeline?

36:05.080 --> 36:06.116
<i>Olly!</i>

36:06.331 --> 36:08.072
- Maddy? Maddy, what are you doing?
- Are you okay?

36:10.377 --> 36:11.367
Madeline?

36:11.628 --> 36:12.618
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

36:12.837 --> 36:14.669
I'm okay. What are you doing?
Go back inside! Go!

36:14.881 --> 36:16.497
Madeline! Madeline!

36:16.883 --> 36:18.670
What are you doing?

36:24.933 --> 36:26.424
I don't understand. Why would you do that?

36:26.601 --> 36:28.342
I'm sorry.
I had to make sure that he was okay.

36:28.561 --> 36:29.551
- Did you touch anything?
- No.

36:29.771 --> 36:30.761
Did you touch anything?

36:30.980 --> 36:32.516
No, no. It was less than a minute.

36:32.732 --> 36:34.769
A second is all it takes.

36:34.943 --> 36:36.525
I'm sorry.

36:36.736 --> 36:40.776
Why would you risk your life
for a total stranger?

36:42.367 --> 36:43.858
I'm okay.

36:47.122 --> 36:49.614
He's not a stranger, is he?

36:52.585 --> 36:55.123
We're just friends online.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.503
Online...

37:03.304 --> 37:04.715
How could you?

37:06.725 --> 37:08.387
<i>She's right.</i>

37:08.601 --> 37:13.596
<i>Four hours soaking in an antiseptic bath,</i>
<i>and I could still wake up tomorrow sick.</i>

37:13.815 --> 37:17.434
<i>Four hours trying to remember everything</i>
<i>about being in the world.</i>

37:18.194 --> 37:23.155
<i>I can't remember any of it.</i>
<i>Just Olly yelling at me to go inside.</i>

37:26.327 --> 37:28.785
I'm sorry Olly's in that situation.

37:29.414 --> 37:31.155
No one deserves a father like that.

37:31.958 --> 37:33.824
I'm sorry, too.

37:36.838 --> 37:38.329
Does it look like he's okay?

37:38.965 --> 37:40.922
I don't know.

37:41.468 --> 37:45.633
I could have someone talk to him
and see if he's all right.

37:46.014 --> 37:48.848
I don't think he wants anyone to know.

37:50.685 --> 37:53.052
He was trying to protect his mom.

37:54.773 --> 37:57.937
He doesn't like to talk about everything.

37:58.693 --> 38:00.855
I knew something was different with you.

38:02.030 --> 38:05.865
I should've known what it was
the moment he came offering Bundt cake.

38:10.538 --> 38:12.154
You could've come to me, you know.

38:12.373 --> 38:14.706
I wanted to. I just didn't want to worry you.

38:16.711 --> 38:18.202
What's he like?

38:20.089 --> 38:22.877
Well, he wears black,

38:24.385 --> 38:26.672
all of the time.

38:29.390 --> 38:31.222
But he's not as cynical as he looks.

38:31.434 --> 38:32.720
He needs a haircut.

38:32.894 --> 38:34.055
Yeah, he does.

38:36.105 --> 38:38.017
<i>He's kind.</i>

38:39.067 --> 38:41.559
We're both really sleep deprived

38:41.778 --> 38:44.191
from talking instead of sleeping.

38:47.700 --> 38:50.738
But I'd rather talk to him than sleep.

38:56.918 --> 38:59.251
When I talk to him,

39:01.214 --> 39:03.251
I feel like I'm outside.

39:11.933 --> 39:13.265
He thinks

39:13.935 --> 39:18.521
that I'm funny, smart, and beautiful.

39:19.148 --> 39:20.730
In that order.

39:21.276 --> 39:23.268
As he should.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.691
He sounds wonderful.

39:26.906 --> 39:28.272
Yeah, he is.

39:29.117 --> 39:31.200
I wish you could have more than this.

39:32.120 --> 39:33.782
I know.

39:43.673 --> 39:45.335
I'm sorry.

39:47.802 --> 39:50.169
It's not your fault.

39:56.144 --> 39:59.137
Maui was your dad's favorite place.

39:59.480 --> 40:04.396
<i>You were just a few months old,</i>
<i>before we knew why you were always sick.</i>

40:04.944 --> 40:07.482
I wish I could remember them.

40:10.158 --> 40:13.071
Maybe it'd be easier if I couldn't.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.413
I love you, you know.

40:22.420 --> 40:25.333
More than you even know.

40:28.009 --> 40:30.547
You can't see him again.

40:32.931 --> 40:35.173
I haven't seen him.

40:46.694 --> 40:48.401
Yes, you have.

41:01.918 --> 41:03.159
<i>She was so alone, she needed...</i>

41:03.378 --> 41:05.119
<i>How could you let him into this house?</i>

41:06.339 --> 41:07.420
<i>How could you do this?</i>

41:07.632 --> 41:09.874
<i>How could you invite a stranger in here?</i>

41:10.051 --> 41:11.041
<i>She needed it.</i>

41:11.260 --> 41:13.547
It's not up to you to decide
what she needs. I am her mother!

41:13.721 --> 41:15.053
You shouldn't be her doctor, too.

41:15.640 --> 41:16.721
<i>Excuse me.</i>

41:16.933 --> 41:18.845
<i>Is she sick? Did something happen?</i>

41:19.060 --> 41:22.599
She went outside because of him.
Because of you!

41:22.814 --> 41:25.056
And she's been lying to me for weeks.

41:27.026 --> 41:28.016
You have to go.

41:28.444 --> 41:29.434
<i>Please, Mom.</i>

41:29.654 --> 41:30.770
It won't happen again.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.605
No, it won't.

41:35.076 --> 41:36.567
I'm sorry, Carla.

41:47.046 --> 41:48.207
No.

41:49.424 --> 41:50.631
I'm sorry.

41:51.426 --> 41:52.883
I know this is sad for you both.

41:53.094 --> 41:54.426
It is sad for me, too,

41:54.637 --> 41:57.596
but it is time for Carla to leave, now.

42:16.451 --> 42:18.784
Your temperature is 103.

42:20.121 --> 42:22.829
We have to wait and see if it goes down.

42:23.041 --> 42:25.533
If the fluids and antibiotics work.

44:29.584 --> 44:31.246
I'm not.

44:48.603 --> 44:50.560
Good morning, Madeline.

44:51.272 --> 44:56.643
You may address me as Nurse Janet
or Mrs. Pritchert.

44:57.111 --> 44:59.353
<i>Whichever you prefer.</i>

45:05.786 --> 45:09.154
Words spoken to the air tend to go unheeded.

45:09.373 --> 45:12.832
Words put to paper do not.

45:47.495 --> 45:48.485
I miss Carla.

45:48.704 --> 45:50.491
Well, Carla almost got you killed.

45:50.831 --> 45:52.072
She's my friend.

45:52.416 --> 45:54.203
No, Madeline. Carla was your nurse.

45:54.418 --> 45:56.660
She was supposed to keep you safe,
not endanger your life

45:56.837 --> 45:59.079
by inviting strangers into the house.

46:00.049 --> 46:01.631
Olly isn't a stranger.

46:03.928 --> 46:05.294
He's not yours.

46:05.680 --> 46:06.841
What?

46:09.475 --> 46:11.137
He's not yours.

46:12.436 --> 46:15.895
And maybe he's interested in you now,
but he's out there.

46:16.440 --> 46:20.309
And he's gonna meet some girl
and he's gonna be her Olly.

46:21.696 --> 46:23.358
You understand me?

46:24.699 --> 46:27.737
If Carla was your friend,
she would have told you that.

46:32.873 --> 46:34.865
Love can't kill me, Mom.

46:35.209 --> 46:36.871
That's not true.

46:37.378 --> 46:39.461
You were lucky this time.

46:53.352 --> 46:55.719
<i>After what my mom said,
I started imagining this moment</i>

46:55.938 --> 46:57.770
<i>where Olly pulls up in the driveway.</i>

47:00.276 --> 47:02.734
<i>And there's this girl in the truck.</i>

47:03.696 --> 47:06.530
<i>And the girl laughs at something he says.</i>

47:06.991 --> 47:09.825
<i>And puts her hand on his shoulder.</i>

47:10.119 --> 47:12.076
<i>Smiles at him the way I've smiled at him.</i>

47:12.747 --> 47:14.079
<i>I feel silly.</i>

47:14.290 --> 47:17.624
<i>Why would anyone set themselves up</i>
<i>to have a broken heart?</i>

47:17.835 --> 47:20.373
<i>He's going to meet someone who isn't sick.</i>

47:21.422 --> 47:24.506
<i>Someone who can leave her house.</i>

47:30.723 --> 47:32.339
<i>Call him.</i>

47:33.017 --> 47:36.226
I can't. I think my mom's right.

47:36.437 --> 47:38.099
<i>Then don't be a coward.</i>

47:47.448 --> 47:49.155
Pick up.

47:50.826 --> 47:51.987
No.

47:53.371 --> 47:54.452
Pick up!

47:56.123 --> 47:57.113
Hi, Olly.

47:57.375 --> 47:58.456
It's not true.

47:58.667 --> 48:00.283
It is. What kind of future
could you have with me?

48:00.461 --> 48:01.451
I'm trying to protect you.

48:01.670 --> 48:03.787
Protect me? I don't want protection.
I want you.

48:04.006 --> 48:06.669
Well, we can't have everything that we want.

48:07.426 --> 48:08.792
You're not mine.

48:09.095 --> 48:10.461
What does that mean?

48:10.638 --> 48:13.346
There's gonna be another girl,
you'll be her Olly.

48:13.808 --> 48:15.800
There is no other girl.

48:18.813 --> 48:21.897
It's not safe.
I don't really think when I'm around you.

48:22.400 --> 48:23.811
Thinking is overrated.

48:24.026 --> 48:26.268
This isn't going anywhere.

48:27.738 --> 48:29.525
I don't wanna lose you.

48:29.740 --> 48:31.732
<i>I can't even go outside.</i>

48:32.660 --> 48:34.822
What are you really losing?

49:55.951 --> 49:56.941
<i>Dear Mom,</i>

49:59.330 --> 50:01.413
<i>The first thing is that I love you.</i>

50:01.999 --> 50:03.365
<i>You already know that,</i>

50:03.584 --> 50:05.792
<i>but I may not get</i>
<i>the chance to tell you again.</i>

50:06.504 --> 50:10.418
<i>You are smart and strong</i>
<i>and kind and selfless.</i>

50:14.386 --> 50:16.503
<i>Because of you, I've survived this long</i>

50:16.722 --> 50:19.305
<i>and gotten to know</i>
<i>my small part of the world.</i>

50:21.769 --> 50:23.510
<i>But it's not enough.</i>

50:33.614 --> 50:35.776
<i>I'm not doing this just because of Olly.</i>

50:35.991 --> 50:37.823
<i>Or maybe I am.</i>

50:40.454 --> 50:43.037
<i>I found this new part of myself</i>
<i>when I met him.</i>

50:43.457 --> 50:46.370
<i>And the new part doesn't know how</i>
<i>to stay quiet and just observe.</i>

50:50.005 --> 50:52.748
<i>Do you remember when we first read</i>
The Little Prince <i>together?</i>

50:52.967 --> 50:54.583
<i>I was so upset that he died in the end.</i>

50:56.595 --> 50:58.461
<i>I didn't understand how he could choose death</i>

50:58.639 --> 51:01.256
<i>so that he could get back to his rose.</i>

51:03.227 --> 51:05.059
<i>I think I understand it now.</i>

51:05.271 --> 51:06.978
<i>I'm not choosing death.</i>

51:07.898 --> 51:09.810
<i>It's that if I don't go,</i>

51:09.984 --> 51:12.647
<i>I won't really know</i>
<i>what it's like to be alive.</i>

51:14.613 --> 51:15.649
<i>I love you.</i>

51:15.990 --> 51:17.231
<i>Maddy.</i>

52:44.912 --> 52:46.153
Maddy, what the hell's...

52:48.415 --> 52:50.327
Hey. Are you trying to kill yourself?

52:50.542 --> 52:51.658
I've been doing gene therapy.

52:51.877 --> 52:52.913
What are you talking about?

52:53.754 --> 52:56.504
I didn't want to tell you because
I didn't want to get your hopes up.

52:56.757 --> 52:58.749
I mean, I don't want to get my hopes up.

52:59.259 --> 53:01.376
- Gene therapy?
- I've been on a trial.

53:01.595 --> 53:03.211
Remember how I said that
my type of SCID was uncommon?

53:03.430 --> 53:04.420
Yeah.

53:04.598 --> 53:06.430
Well, I'm very common now.

53:07.351 --> 53:08.933
I can go wherever I want.

53:09.812 --> 53:11.474
What, you're not sick anymore?

53:11.689 --> 53:13.430
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

53:13.607 --> 53:15.098
No...

53:15.984 --> 53:17.395
No, I don't believe you. Come on, let's go.

53:17.945 --> 53:20.938
Have I ever lied to you?

53:21.156 --> 53:22.146
No.

53:22.366 --> 53:23.902
So, why would I start now?

53:25.577 --> 53:29.070
Look, if you're not sick, then why
does it look like you're running away?

53:29.289 --> 53:30.450
Well, my mom is still worried.

53:30.624 --> 53:32.661
I knew it was too good to be true.
Just go back inside, come on.

53:32.876 --> 53:34.412
No, Olly, I have to know.

53:34.628 --> 53:35.618
Know what?

53:35.796 --> 53:37.753
I need to know if I'm still sick.

53:38.549 --> 53:41.542
And the only way that
I'll know is if I'm outside.

53:42.594 --> 53:44.551
Will you come with me?

53:44.763 --> 53:45.753
Come with you where?

53:45.973 --> 53:47.214
- Hawaii.
- Hawaii?

53:47.433 --> 53:49.049
I bought plane tickets.

53:49.977 --> 53:50.967
How?

53:51.645 --> 53:54.262
Credit cards are surprisingly easy to get.

53:54.815 --> 53:56.522
You're serious?

54:00.571 --> 54:03.234
What's wrong with Southern California?

54:06.201 --> 54:07.317
- Look, stay here, all right?
- Okay.

54:07.494 --> 54:08.655
Stay here.

54:22.885 --> 54:24.342
Here.

54:41.820 --> 54:42.981
Okay.

54:48.118 --> 54:49.325
Wait.

54:53.332 --> 54:55.369
Just try not to breathe.

54:56.502 --> 54:58.038
Ready?

54:59.630 --> 55:01.337
Just till Friday, okay?

55:01.548 --> 55:02.629
And if anybody asks,

55:03.217 --> 55:04.879
you don't know where I am.

55:10.265 --> 55:11.426
No, I'm fine.

55:11.642 --> 55:13.349
<i>Just be good.</i>

55:13.560 --> 55:15.267
And take care of Mom.

55:28.742 --> 55:30.574
We're going really fast.

55:31.286 --> 55:33.369
I'm going 30.

55:33.705 --> 55:34.695
Is that fast?

55:34.915 --> 55:36.247
No.

55:37.626 --> 55:39.709
Can we go faster?

55:50.514 --> 55:52.631
Madeline? Are you up?

56:22.713 --> 56:23.703
<i>Welcome aboard.</i>

56:23.881 --> 56:25.793
<i>All luggage should fit</i>
<i>in the overhead compartment</i>

56:25.966 --> 56:27.457
<i>or under the seat in front of you.</i>

56:39.605 --> 56:41.187
How you feeling?

56:41.815 --> 56:43.181
Terrified.

57:06.465 --> 57:07.626
You okay?

57:10.510 --> 57:11.967
This is crazy.

57:14.014 --> 57:15.004
Hi.

57:15.223 --> 57:16.213
<i>Aloha.</i>

57:17.559 --> 57:18.549
<i>Aloha.</i>

57:18.769 --> 57:19.759
Don't die.

57:19.978 --> 57:21.765
I'll try not to.

58:40.892 --> 58:41.928
Wow.

58:52.279 --> 58:53.486
Big bed.

59:07.252 --> 59:08.834
I found food.

59:09.755 --> 59:11.587
<i>That's very resourceful.</i>

59:13.300 --> 59:15.087
- Mmm.
- I wanna go in the water.

59:15.302 --> 59:16.292
Okay.

59:16.470 --> 59:18.553
I wanna see a <i>humuhumunukunukuapua'a.</i>

59:18.764 --> 59:19.880
A what?

59:20.390 --> 59:22.302
It's the Hawaiian state fish.

59:22.517 --> 59:23.678
Say it.

59:23.935 --> 59:25.176
You're setting me up to fail.

59:27.773 --> 59:31.437
<i>We have a 10-57.</i>
<i>Any units in the vicinity, please respond.</i>

59:40.869 --> 59:42.360
Where is your brother?

59:45.165 --> 59:46.326
Uh...

59:46.750 --> 59:47.957
Summer school.

59:48.168 --> 59:50.000
I don't think that's true.

59:50.587 --> 59:52.374
I don't know where they are.

59:53.173 --> 59:55.506
I'm asking you for your help.

59:55.675 --> 59:57.007
Where's Madeline?

59:57.344 --> 59:58.551
I'm sorry.

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:49.886
Maddy?

01:00:54.442 --> 01:00:55.683
You're in a swimsuit.

01:00:56.361 --> 01:00:57.852
Yeah, I am.

01:00:58.655 --> 01:00:59.691
It's, um...

01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:03.612
It's...

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:04.908
Small.

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:06.159
It's small.

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:07.653
It's small.

01:01:07.873 --> 01:01:08.863
Yeah.

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:12.203
- I'll just be out here.
- Yeah. Okay.

01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:21.880
Yes!

01:01:22.596 --> 01:01:24.679
This umbrella's open over here.

01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:29.217
Oh, my God!

01:02:01.635 --> 01:02:04.298
Ready? Just lie back. Lay flat. Lay flat.

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:29.795
Uh...

01:03:43.945 --> 01:03:45.061
Together?

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.316
You know what? Um...

01:03:46.531 --> 01:03:48.193
I'll go first. Okay?

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:50.900
Yeah, you go first.

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:54.028
See you at the bottom.

01:04:07.761 --> 01:04:08.797
Whoo!

01:04:58.478 --> 01:05:01.721
<i>Far as I can tell, she's happy</i>

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:07.943
<i>Livin' with her Macky</i>

01:05:11.699 --> 01:05:14.737
<i>So please don't take</i>

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:18.071
<i>My love</i>

01:06:14.345 --> 01:06:17.964
It's strange,
'cause I don't even remember them.

01:06:20.351 --> 01:06:23.890
I think it's weird to miss something
that you never had.

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:27.064
Or, you know, don't remember having.

01:06:28.776 --> 01:06:30.483
Not so weird.

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:36.907
We came here before they died.

01:06:37.952 --> 01:06:39.068
And before I got sick.

01:06:40.413 --> 01:06:42.496
Well, you're not sick now.

01:06:47.629 --> 01:06:48.915
Why would you move?

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:50.246
You asked me that already.

01:06:50.507 --> 01:06:52.499
<i>Yeah, but you didn't answer.</i>

01:06:55.553 --> 01:06:59.012
My dad is not very good at staying employed.

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:03.934
And my mom feels trapped.

01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:06.645
I just don't know why she won't leave him.

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:08.563
Well, have you asked her?

01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:09.856
Yeah.

01:07:10.068 --> 01:07:12.230
She doesn't talk about it anymore,

01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:14.437
but she used to say that,

01:07:16.574 --> 01:07:19.066
"You'd understand when you get older

01:07:19.911 --> 01:07:22.619
"and when you have your own relationships."

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:25.827
She says love makes people crazy.

01:07:26.668 --> 01:07:27.875
Do you believe that?

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:29.868
Do you?

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:35.796
Well, I mean, I'm here
in Hawaii with you, so...

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:38.670
I guess so.

01:07:41.474 --> 01:07:43.466
Are you saying you're in love with me?

01:07:43.685 --> 01:07:45.142
No. I...

01:07:46.437 --> 01:07:48.269
I'm just saying...

01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:54.568
I never would have left my house

01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:56.987
if it weren't for you.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:02.818
I love you.

01:08:18.051 --> 01:08:19.087
I...

01:08:21.014 --> 01:08:23.381
I loved you before I knew you.

01:08:44.495 --> 01:08:46.953
So, this is my side. This is...

01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:49.031
I like to sleep on the left.

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:03.791
<i>Hey, Maddy.</i>

01:11:07.054 --> 01:11:08.761
Maddy, are you okay?

01:11:10.641 --> 01:11:12.928
Maddy, what's wrong?

01:11:13.686 --> 01:11:15.143
Maddy, are you okay?

01:11:15.855 --> 01:11:18.268
Whoa! Okay. All right.

01:11:19.066 --> 01:11:20.182
You're burning up.

01:11:20.359 --> 01:11:22.476
Maddy? Maddy?

01:11:22.695 --> 01:11:24.027
Maddy, can you hear me?

01:11:32.914 --> 01:11:33.904
Got it.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.246
Coming through.

01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:43.751
We just gotta get her to triage.

01:11:43.925 --> 01:11:45.416
Let's take her to Exam 2.

01:12:07.114 --> 01:12:08.901
Could you give us a minute?

01:12:18.543 --> 01:12:20.079
Madeline?

01:12:20.545 --> 01:12:21.956
Madeline?

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:52.445
<i>My heart stopped.</i>

01:12:55.121 --> 01:12:57.283
<i>Then it started again.</i>

01:12:58.124 --> 01:12:59.956
<i>When I woke up,</i>

01:13:00.793 --> 01:13:02.500
<i>he was gone.</i>

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:12.802
No, no, no. Lie down.

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:14.804
Lie down, honey.

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:17.929
Lie down.

01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:21.391
Am I okay?

01:13:21.606 --> 01:13:22.767
You're going to be.

01:14:06.317 --> 01:14:07.307
Are you okay?

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:08.516
Yes.

01:14:09.153 --> 01:14:11.361
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm okay, Olly.

01:14:12.531 --> 01:14:14.944
It's nice to be able to talk to you again.

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:17.784
I tried to visit,
but your mom wouldn't let me.

01:14:17.995 --> 01:14:20.453
Yeah, I'm sorry
I put you through all of that.

01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:22.364
I can't do this anymore.

01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:24.498
Can't do what?

01:14:25.378 --> 01:14:27.415
No more texts.

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:28.871
No more e-mails.

01:14:29.048 --> 01:14:31.131
Olly, this is just too hard.

01:14:32.259 --> 01:14:34.751
My mom was right, life was better before.

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:36.212
Better for who?

01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:37.466
Ellipses.

01:14:37.682 --> 01:14:39.344
Don't do this, Maddy.

01:14:41.185 --> 01:14:42.266
Ellipses.

01:14:42.478 --> 01:14:45.892
Look, my life is better with you in it.

01:14:46.065 --> 01:14:47.681
But mine isn't.

01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:51.476
You know, I lied before.

01:14:52.071 --> 01:14:53.357
<i>About what?</i>

01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:55.067
I do feel sorry for you.

01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:22.091
<i>Tomorrow,</i>

01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:25.136
I am back at the hospital.

01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:28.435
Did you find me a good babysitter?

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.609
Actually, I've been thinking
maybe you don't need a nurse.

01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:35.608
You learned a tough lesson,
and I can't imagine you repeating it.

01:15:36.282 --> 01:15:37.489
No.

01:15:38.325 --> 01:15:39.532
Good.

01:16:44.517 --> 01:16:47.260
<i>I wish you'd talk to me.</i>

01:16:47.478 --> 01:16:50.312
<i>I'll never meet anyone like you, Maddy.</i>

01:16:50.523 --> 01:16:53.516
<i>You look at the ocean</i>
<i>like it was meant for you.</i>

01:16:54.318 --> 01:16:57.311
<i>You jump off cliffs</i>
<i>even though you can't swim.</i>

01:16:58.197 --> 01:17:02.032
<i>You think you can find</i>
<i>the meaning of life in a book.</i>

01:17:02.827 --> 01:17:05.160
<i>You don't have any vices.</i>

01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:07.363
<i>You should really get some.</i>

01:17:09.208 --> 01:17:11.700
<i>I'm trying not to love you.</i>

01:17:12.545 --> 01:17:14.036
<i>But I'm failing.</i>

01:17:15.965 --> 01:17:17.957
<i>This is my last e-mail.</i>

01:17:18.175 --> 01:17:19.916
<i>We're moving back to New York.</i>

01:17:21.846 --> 01:17:25.510
<i>We're leaving tonight,</i>
<i>when my dad's out drinking.</i>

01:17:25.683 --> 01:17:28.930
<i>My mom wants to do it at night, because
she's afraid she won't be able to do it</i>

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:30.977
<i>if he's right in front of her.</i>

01:17:32.148 --> 01:17:33.559
<i>I finally told her about you.</i>

01:17:35.526 --> 01:17:37.813
<i>She thinks you're brave.</i>

01:17:40.614 --> 01:17:43.322
<i>Being with you made me brave.</i>

01:18:27.953 --> 01:18:29.160
Hello?

01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:31.322
- <i>Madeline Whittier?</i>
- Yes.

01:18:31.582 --> 01:18:35.417
<i>Hi, this is Dr. Melissa Francis</i>
<i>from Maui Memorial Hospital.</i>

01:18:35.628 --> 01:18:38.587
<i>I was your attending physician</i>
<i>while you were here.</i>

01:18:38.797 --> 01:18:41.164
<i>I'm just following up on your lab results.</i>

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:44.672
<i>Your myocarditis was caused</i>
<i>by a viral infection.</i>

01:18:45.596 --> 01:18:48.555
<i>You seem to have a very weak immune system.</i>

01:18:48.766 --> 01:18:49.802
Well, I have SCID.

01:18:49.975 --> 01:18:52.843
<i>SCID? Really? Why would you think that?</i>

01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:54.803
I've had it since I was a baby.

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:55.970
<i>I don't know...</i>

01:18:56.148 --> 01:18:58.640
<i>If you had that kind</i>
<i>of severe immunodeficiency,</i>

01:18:58.859 --> 01:19:01.192
<i>you probably would have suffered</i>
<i>more than myocarditis.</i>

01:19:38.148 --> 01:19:39.184
What's going on?

01:19:42.069 --> 01:19:43.560
Am I sick?

01:19:44.154 --> 01:19:45.190
What?

01:19:46.323 --> 01:19:47.985
Am I sick?

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.941
Do you feel sick?

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:51.988
That's not what I mean.

01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:00.953
Do you remember meeting
a Dr. Francis in Maui?

01:20:01.171 --> 01:20:04.255
I met lots of doctors in Maui, why?

01:20:05.592 --> 01:20:08.335
She doesn't think I have SCID.

01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:13.094
And she got your hopes up, didn't she?

01:20:15.394 --> 01:20:19.138
It was irresponsible of her to do that.

01:20:19.356 --> 01:20:21.814
S.C.I.D. is so rare

01:20:22.026 --> 01:20:23.767
and so complicated.

01:20:23.986 --> 01:20:28.026
Not everyone understands it.
There's just too many types.

01:20:28.365 --> 01:20:31.574
And every person reacts differently.

01:20:31.744 --> 01:20:32.905
You get that, don't you?

01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:34.740
Yeah, that's what you've always told me.

01:20:34.955 --> 01:20:36.287
Well, you just saw it for yourself.

01:20:36.457 --> 01:20:40.408
You were fine for a little while, and then
you almost died in that emergency room.

01:20:40.586 --> 01:20:44.421
Immune systems are very complicated.

01:20:44.631 --> 01:20:49.046
And Dr. Francis doesn't know
your full medical history.

01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:51.969
She's just looking at a tiny fraction.

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:55.265
She hasn't been here
the whole time like I have.

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:01.228
Where are the papers, Mom?

01:21:02.399 --> 01:21:04.607
What are you talking about?

01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:08.437
You have records for everything.

01:21:08.655 --> 01:21:10.647
But you have nothing about SCID!

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:12.073
Where are the papers?

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:16.277
Well, they must be here,

01:21:16.455 --> 01:21:18.663
because I keep...

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:22.288
I keep everything and I...

01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:24.961
Did you...

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:27.418
Did you take them?

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:29.419
<i>The papers?</i>

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:39.009
Madeline?

01:21:40.521 --> 01:21:41.853
Madeline?

01:21:50.823 --> 01:21:52.359
<i>Madeline?</i>

01:21:52.533 --> 01:21:54.024
Madeline?

01:21:57.037 --> 01:21:59.745
Madeline, what are you doing? Are you okay?

01:21:59.998 --> 01:22:01.284
Come inside, come inside.

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.082
Why?

01:22:04.503 --> 01:22:06.620
Why do I have to go inside, Mom?

01:22:06.839 --> 01:22:09.877
Because you're sick, baby. You're sick.

01:22:10.092 --> 01:22:11.208
No.

01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:13.339
Madeline, please. Please.

01:22:13.512 --> 01:22:14.844
I'm not going back inside.

01:22:15.055 --> 01:22:16.045
You have to.

01:22:17.307 --> 01:22:20.050
You're all I have left. I can't lose you.

01:22:20.811 --> 01:22:22.052
Please.

01:22:22.855 --> 01:22:25.142
Have I ever been sick?

01:22:28.735 --> 01:22:29.771
Come inside.

01:22:31.321 --> 01:22:32.857
Come inside.

01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:35.023
Come inside, Madeline.

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:36.862
Madeline, don't.

01:22:37.744 --> 01:22:39.155
Madeline, don't.

01:22:39.371 --> 01:22:40.612
Madeline.

01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:42.159
Madeline!

01:22:43.083 --> 01:22:44.449
Madeline!

01:23:30.255 --> 01:23:32.292
<i>We're not sure about the state
of your immune system.</i>

01:23:32.508 --> 01:23:37.128
<i>We think it's possible that</i>
<i>it's underdeveloped, like an infant's.</i>

01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:41.765
<i>It hasn't been exposed to common viruses</i>
<i>or bacterial infections.</i>

01:23:42.351 --> 01:23:44.217
<i>You don't have S.C.I.D.</i>

01:23:45.938 --> 01:23:47.270
Why did I get sick in Hawaii?

01:23:47.481 --> 01:23:50.224
<i>Well, normal, healthy people</i>
<i>get sick all the time.</i>

01:24:12.256 --> 01:24:14.623
I brought you some of your things.

01:24:21.932 --> 01:24:24.845
I'm only taking it because
I want you to leave.

01:24:32.859 --> 01:24:36.023
Right after your dad and your brother died,

01:24:38.657 --> 01:24:40.819
you got so sick.

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:44.069
You wouldn't breathe right.

01:24:44.997 --> 01:24:49.082
And I took you to the emergency room,
where we had to stay for three days,

01:24:50.335 --> 01:24:53.248
and they couldn't figure out
what was wrong with you.

01:24:54.798 --> 01:24:58.462
They said it was probably
some kind of allergy,

01:24:59.344 --> 01:25:02.587
and they gave me a list of things
to stay away from and...

01:25:06.226 --> 01:25:07.558
I was...

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:11.229
I was so sure it was something else.

01:25:21.408 --> 01:25:23.650
I love you, Maddy.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:30.657
And I hope you still love me.

01:25:34.504 --> 01:25:36.245
I'm so sorry.

01:26:07.162 --> 01:26:11.031
<i>The universe already took my dad
and brother away from my mom.</i>

01:26:12.751 --> 01:26:15.084
<i>She was afraid to lose me, too.</i>

01:26:15.462 --> 01:26:18.921
<i>So she made herself believe that I was sick.</i>

01:26:21.551 --> 01:26:25.636
<i>I can understand how she felt. Almost.</i>

01:26:26.515 --> 01:26:28.097
<i>I'm trying to.</i>

01:26:30.686 --> 01:26:32.678
<i>My mother loved my father.</i>

01:26:36.983 --> 01:26:39.270
<i>He was the love of her life.</i>

01:26:40.612 --> 01:26:42.729
<i>And she loved my brother.</i>

01:26:43.657 --> 01:26:46.115
<i>He was the love of her life.</i>

01:26:47.369 --> 01:26:49.361
<i>And she loves me.</i>

01:26:50.414 --> 01:26:52.747
<i>I am the love of her life.</i>

01:26:55.127 --> 01:26:56.993
<i>I want to forgive her.</i>

01:26:58.296 --> 01:27:03.132
<i>But right now, all I can think about</i>
<i>is everything I've missed.</i>

01:27:11.309 --> 01:27:13.426
<i>I've been trying to find the single moment</i>

01:27:13.645 --> 01:27:15.978
<i>that set my life on its path.</i>

01:27:16.773 --> 01:27:19.390
<i>Maybe there's a version of my life</i>
<i>where I'm sick.</i>

01:27:20.485 --> 01:27:22.477
<i>A version where I die in Hawaii.</i>

01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:28.195
<i>Another where my father and brother are</i>
<i>still alive and my mother's not broken.</i>

01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:32.783
<i>There's even a version</i>
<i>of my life without Olly in it.</i>

01:28:41.441 --> 01:28:42.522
Hi.

01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:44.896
Hey.

01:28:47.447 --> 01:28:50.902
Do you ever wonder what your life would be
like if you could just change one thing?

01:28:51.451 --> 01:28:54.615
What if changing one thing made things worse?

01:28:55.247 --> 01:28:56.783
What if we hadn't met?

01:28:57.332 --> 01:28:58.698
But we did.

01:28:59.459 --> 01:29:00.666
We did.

01:29:06.424 --> 01:29:08.632
I'm sorry that I didn't say goodbye.

01:29:10.136 --> 01:29:12.253
Are you sure you should be here?

01:29:14.015 --> 01:29:15.677
Probably not.

01:29:22.107 --> 01:29:24.815
What if today was the first day that we met?

01:29:26.611 --> 01:29:27.943
Okay.

01:29:31.449 --> 01:29:33.907
I'm so happy to meet you.

01:29:46.131 --> 01:29:48.464
I'm so happy to meet you, too.
