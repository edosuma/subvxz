18:57.094 --> 18:58.387
- GOOD VORNICARN.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.513
- IS SHE TRAINING THAT THING?

18:59.596 --> 19:02.599
- AND GO ONLY ON THE PAPERS,
VORNICARN.

19:02.683 --> 19:03.851
- I'M GONNA GO WITH YES.

19:03.934 --> 19:06.520
- WAIT, WE CAN GO ON PAPERS?

19:06.603 --> 19:09.982
HELLO, PORTA-POTTY.

19:10.065 --> 19:11.775
- SIT, VORNICARN.

19:11.859 --> 19:14.611
SIT.
[Vornicarn growls]

19:14.695 --> 19:19.491
THIS...IS...
NOT...SITTING!

19:19.575 --> 19:22.452
- THIS IS THE GREATEST MOMENT
OF MY PRESIDENCY.

19:22.536 --> 19:24.288
MARGARET, PLAY SOMETHING
INSPIRATIONAL.

19:24.371 --> 19:27.583
[hip-hop music]
AWW, YEAH.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.751
- MR. PRESIDENT,
WE SHOULD PROBABLY CHECK

19:29.835 --> 19:31.336
TO SEE IF THE MONSTERS
HAD ANY LUCK

19:31.420 --> 19:33.172
BEFORE EXPLODING
OUR OWN BASE.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.507
- TOO EXCITED.
SOMEBODY GIVE ME A COUNTDOWN!

19:35.591 --> 19:36.425
START WITH TEN--

19:36.508 --> 19:39.428
NO, SIX.
I CAN'T WAIT!

19:39.511 --> 19:44.766
- SIX, FIVE, FOUR,
THREE, TWO...

19:44.850 --> 19:45.851
[explosion]

19:45.934 --> 19:48.020
[snarling]

19:48.103 --> 19:51.106
- WHAT IN THE--

19:51.189 --> 19:55.444
- CONSIDER YOURSELF
DOMESTICATED.

19:55.527 --> 19:56.111
[Vornicarn purrs]

19:56.194 --> 19:57.779
- GENERAL MONGER, WAIT.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.364
THAT'S THE VORNICARN.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.366
IT'S LIKE SOME KIND
OF ALIEN PET TO HER.

20:01.450 --> 20:04.786
- IT'S ALL IN MY REPORT, SIR.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.122
- I STILL GET TO BLOW UP
THE BASE THOUGH, RIGHT?

20:07.205 --> 20:10.083
OW! DARN IT, MARGARET,
THAT REALLY STINGS.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.209
- I WANT A DEBRIEFING,

20:11.293 --> 20:13.503
AND I WANT IT BRIEF,
GOLDEN GIRLY.

20:13.587 --> 20:17.132
- THE VORNICARN IS
GALAXY'S BEST HUNTING BEAST.

20:17.215 --> 20:19.468
WHEN I LEARNED THAT ONE HATCHED
ON YOUR PLANET,

20:19.551 --> 20:21.053
OF COURSE I CAME
AT LIGHT SPEED.

20:21.136 --> 20:22.930
- AND YOU COULD NOT, PERHAPS,

20:23.013 --> 20:25.098
HAVE TOLD US THIS
FROM THE BEGINNING.

20:25.182 --> 20:28.560
- BUT THEN YOU WOULD NOT HAVE
BEEN SO WHINY CRY BABY SCARED.

20:28.644 --> 20:32.648
THE VORNICARN LIKES FEAR.
YOU CANNOT FAKE THAT.

20:32.731 --> 20:36.151
- YEAH, YOU WOULDN'T WANNA, YOU
KNOW, BE FAKE ABOUT ANYTHING.

20:36.234 --> 20:37.861
WOW, THAT CAME OUT BITTER.
ON PURPOSE.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.030
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.949
UNAUTHORIZED TRAINING
ACTIVITY OVER.

20:42.032 --> 20:43.575
TIME TO HITCH A LIGHT BEAM

20:43.659 --> 20:45.494
BACK TO "OFF MY PLANET,"
PRONTO.

20:45.577 --> 20:48.789
- IT WILL BE MY PLEASURE
TO LEAVE THIS--

20:48.872 --> 20:50.749
IMPOSSIBLE!

20:50.832 --> 20:53.085
- IT'S A MESSAGE
FROM STA'ABI'S HOME WORLD.

20:53.168 --> 20:55.003
SHE HAS BEEN ORDERED
TO STAY ON EARTH

20:55.087 --> 20:57.464
BY SPECIAL REQUEST
OF THE GALACTIC COUNCIL.

20:57.547 --> 21:02.010
- HOW WONDERFUL
AND UNEXPECTED.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.220
[chuckles]
[beeps]

21:03.303 --> 21:05.013
- TO PLACE ANOTHER CALL
TO THE GALACTIC COUNCIL--

21:05.097 --> 21:07.265
- [grunting]
BE QUIET.

21:07.349 --> 21:10.352
- IT WILL TAKE
MUCH TRAINING TO KEEP

21:10.435 --> 21:12.354
FROM TURNING SOFT
ON THIS PLANET

21:12.437 --> 21:15.732
OF STUCK-OUT BELLIES
AND THUMB-SUCKING PRESIDENTS.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.150
- WELCOME ABOARD.

21:17.234 --> 21:21.697
- DO YOU HAVE ANY WARRIORS
TO SPARE FOR CARNAGE PRACTICE?

21:21.780 --> 21:24.199
- WHERE'S THAT KID
WITH THE RED TAG?

21:24.282 --> 21:25.826
- ARE YOU QUITE ALL RIGHT,
OLD FRIEND?

21:25.909 --> 21:26.910
- MIXED FEELINGS.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.996
SURE, SHE'S DEVIOUS
AND CONNIVING,

21:29.079 --> 21:30.122
AND HER DOG TRIED TO EAT ME.

21:30.205 --> 21:31.373
BUT I'VE LEARNED TODAY

21:31.456 --> 21:33.417
THAT ALIENS CAN HAVE
GOOD QUALITIES TOO.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.334
- MM-HMM.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.002
- LIKE THE WAY HER EYES
LIGHT UP

21:35.085 --> 21:37.087
WHEN SHE GOES BERSERKO.

21:37.170 --> 21:38.088
OOH, LA, LA.

21:38.171 --> 21:40.173
- [sighs]

21:41.717 --> 21:44.803
- VICTORY SOMBRERO.
