01:49.067 --> 01:51.652
A legend is sung

01:51.736 --> 01:54.947
Of when England was young

01:54.989 --> 02:00.119
And knights were brave and bold

02:01.287 --> 02:03.831
The good king had died

02:03.915 --> 02:07.709
And no one could decide

02:07.794 --> 02:13.423
Who was rightful heir to the throne

02:15.426 --> 02:21.098
It seemed that the land
would be torn by war

02:21.724 --> 02:26.395
Or saved by a miracle alone

02:30.525 --> 02:34.862
And that miracle appeared

02:34.946 --> 02:40.951
In London town

02:43.496 --> 02:46.165
The sword

02:46.249 --> 02:52.379
In the stone

02:55.383 --> 02:58.677
And below the hilt, in letters of gold,

02:58.761 --> 03:01.346
were written these words,

03:01.389 --> 03:05.684
"Whoso pulleth out this sword
of this stone and anvil

03:05.768 --> 03:09.438
"is rightwise king born of England."

03:10.315 --> 03:13.525
Though many tried for the sword
with all their strength,

03:13.568 --> 03:16.528
none could move the sword, nor stir it.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.740
So, the miracle had not worked.

03:19.824 --> 03:23.327
And England was still without a king.

03:23.369 --> 03:27.039
And in time,
the marvelous sword was forgotten.

03:32.712 --> 03:35.589
This was a dark age,

03:35.673 --> 03:38.634
without law and without order.

03:39.761 --> 03:43.096
Men lived in fear of one another,

03:43.181 --> 03:46.141
for the strong preyed upon the weak.

04:17.298 --> 04:20.300
A dark age, indeed!

04:20.593 --> 04:23.428
Age of inconvenience.

04:24.305 --> 04:26.098
No plumbing.

04:27.183 --> 04:29.393
No electricity.

04:29.435 --> 04:31.436
No nothing.

04:33.314 --> 04:35.649
Hang it all!

04:35.733 --> 04:37.526
Hang it all.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.240
Now what? Now what?

04:43.283 --> 04:45.284
Leave off, leave off!

04:46.160 --> 04:49.538
You... You fiendish chain, you!

04:51.582 --> 04:53.625
Everything complicated.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.295
One big medieval mess.

05:05.722 --> 05:08.974
Now, let me see...

05:09.058 --> 05:12.185
He should be here in...
I'd say half an hour.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.521
Who? Who?

05:14.605 --> 05:16.815
I'd like to know who.

05:16.858 --> 05:19.818
I told you, Archimedes. I am not sure.

05:19.861 --> 05:22.529
All I know is that someone
will be coming.

05:22.613 --> 05:23.989
Someone very important.

05:24.866 --> 05:25.991
Pin feathers.

05:26.075 --> 05:29.828
Fate will direct him to me
so that I in turn may guide him

05:29.912 --> 05:32.372
to his rightful place in the world.

05:32.623 --> 05:35.334
And you say he will arrive
in half an hour?

05:37.754 --> 05:39.671
Well, we'll just see.

05:40.715 --> 05:43.008
And you will, Archimedes, you will.

05:46.512 --> 05:49.806
He'll be a boy.

05:49.849 --> 05:52.726
A small boy.

05:52.810 --> 05:56.480
Eleven, 12 years old,

05:56.522 --> 05:59.691
and a scrawny little fellow.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.529
Oh, no, no, no. That can't be the one.

06:04.572 --> 06:07.532
Surely not. Why, that big lad
must be close on to 20.

06:09.535 --> 06:13.622
There he is.
The scrawny little fellow, about 12.

06:14.082 --> 06:16.208
He's a regular little grasshopper.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.127
Look at him go.

06:19.921 --> 06:23.882
And where, where would you guess
he is at this very moment?

06:23.966 --> 06:28.887
I am not guessing, Archimedes.
I know where he is!

06:30.390 --> 06:33.058
Less than a mile from here,

06:33.101 --> 06:35.102
just beyond the forest.

06:35.686 --> 06:37.562
And right on schedule.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.606
If all goes well.

06:40.942 --> 06:43.068
Quiet, Wart.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.986
I'm trying to be.

06:45.071 --> 06:48.990
And nobody asked you to come along
in the first place.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.993
- I'm not even moving.
- Shut up.

06:54.747 --> 06:58.792
Here we go. What a set-up.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.505
Right smack through the old gizzard.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.094
Wha... Wait. Whoa!

07:09.637 --> 07:12.097
Why, you clumsy little fool!

07:12.390 --> 07:15.725
Kay, please, I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.227
Please.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.729
If I ever...

07:19.772 --> 07:24.067
If I ever get my hands on you
I'll wring your scrawny little neck,

07:24.110 --> 07:25.527
so help me, I will.

07:25.611 --> 07:28.280
I'll get the arrow, Kay.
I'm sure I can find it.

07:32.535 --> 07:35.370
Don't tell me you're going in there.

07:35.455 --> 07:39.249
- Why, it's swarming with wolves.
- I'm not afraid.

07:40.668 --> 07:44.337
Well, go ahead. It's your skin, not mine.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.131
Go on, go on.

08:15.411 --> 08:17.621
There it is. There it is!

08:45.399 --> 08:47.192
Wha... Wait. Whoa!

08:51.697 --> 08:53.240
Well.

08:53.658 --> 08:56.868
So, you did drop in for tea, after all.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.289
You are a bit late, you know.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.583
I am?

09:04.043 --> 09:05.210
Yes.

09:05.294 --> 09:07.712
Now, my name is Merlin.

09:09.131 --> 09:11.341
Come, come. Who are you, my lad?

09:11.384 --> 09:14.469
My name's Arthur,
but everyone calls me Wart.

09:16.889 --> 09:19.224
What a perfect stuffed owl.

09:20.101 --> 09:22.602
Stuffed? I beg your pardon!

09:22.687 --> 09:25.230
He's alive, and he talks!

09:25.273 --> 09:28.316
And certainly a great deal better
than you do.

09:29.902 --> 09:31.903
Come, Archimedes.

09:31.988 --> 09:35.407
Come, come, now.
I want you to meet the Wart.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.577
Now, you must forgive him.
He's only a boy.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.745
Boy? Boy.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.914
I see no boy.

09:44.458 --> 09:47.752
- I'm sorry that I...
- That's all right.

09:47.837 --> 09:51.256
- He's much too sensitive.
- Sensitive?

09:51.340 --> 09:53.883
Who? What, what?

09:53.926 --> 09:57.012
- How did you know that I was...
- That you'd be dropping in?

09:57.555 --> 10:01.016
Well, I happen to be a wizard.

10:01.100 --> 10:04.144
A soothsayer, a prognosticator.

10:04.228 --> 10:07.188
I have the power to see into the future.

10:07.273 --> 10:11.276
Centuries into the future.

10:11.319 --> 10:15.905
I've even been there, lad,
and I've seen all these things.

10:15.948 --> 10:20.076
They're only plans and small models,
of course.

10:20.161 --> 10:25.123
Now, this for instance
is a steam locomotive.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.756
There she goes.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.466
Pretty good, eh?

10:40.056 --> 10:42.974
That won't be invented
for hundreds of years.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.353
You mean you can see everything
before it happens?

10:46.437 --> 10:48.313
Yes, everything.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.982
Everything, Merlin?

10:52.526 --> 10:54.819
No, no, not everything.

10:54.904 --> 10:59.199
I... I admit I didn't know whom
to expect for tea.

10:59.283 --> 11:01.534
But as you can see,

11:01.619 --> 11:05.330
I figured the exact place.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.916
You're very clever, sir.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.877
Yes. Well, never mind the "sir".

11:10.961 --> 11:13.463
Just plain Merlin will do.

11:14.465 --> 11:18.218
- Now, would you care for sugar?
- Yes, I would.

11:18.302 --> 11:19.928
- Please.
- All right.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.680
Sugar? Sugar!

11:25.893 --> 11:29.479
No. Manners, manners.
Guests first. You know that!

11:31.941 --> 11:34.859
All right. Just say when, lad.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.319
When.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.448
- Have you had any schooling?
- Yes.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.368
I'm training to be a squire.

11:43.452 --> 11:46.454
I'm learning the rules of combat
and swordsmanship

11:47.289 --> 11:48.873
and jousting and horsemanship.

11:49.375 --> 11:52.210
Yes, yes. Very good. That...

11:52.294 --> 11:56.715
No, no, no! I... I mean a real education.

11:56.757 --> 12:00.927
Mathematics, history,
biology, natural science,

12:01.011 --> 12:03.596
English, Latin, French.

12:03.681 --> 12:07.142
No. When, when! Blast it all. When!

12:09.270 --> 12:11.646
Impudent piece of crockery.

12:15.609 --> 12:18.903
Boy, now, you can't...

12:23.409 --> 12:27.245
You can't grow up
without a decent education, you know.

12:27.329 --> 12:30.331
I suppose not, sir... Merlin.

12:30.416 --> 12:34.002
So, I am going to be your tutor.

12:34.086 --> 12:35.920
But I've got to get back to the castle.

12:36.005 --> 12:39.549
- They'll want me in the kitchen.
- Well, then, very well.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.343
We'll pack and be on our way.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.055
You... You watch now. You'll like this.

12:50.102 --> 12:52.729
Higitus figitus zumbakazing.

12:54.482 --> 12:57.275
I want your attention, everything.

12:59.403 --> 13:02.030
We're packing to leave.
Come on, let's go.

13:02.448 --> 13:05.200
No, no, not you.
Books are always first, you know.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.206
Hockety, pockety, wockety, wack

13:11.290 --> 13:13.249
Abra abra dabra nack

13:13.292 --> 13:17.253
Shrink in size, very small
We've got to save enough room for all

13:17.296 --> 13:21.341
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum
Prestidigitonium

13:29.266 --> 13:33.269
Alakafez, balakazez
Malakamez meripides

13:33.312 --> 13:35.605
Hockety, pockety, wockety...

13:36.982 --> 13:39.192
Now, stop, stop, stop, stop.

13:39.276 --> 13:40.902
Sugar bowl, you're getting rough.

13:40.986 --> 13:43.196
That poor old tea set
is cracked enough.

13:44.698 --> 13:48.493
All right. Let's start again. Let's start...

13:49.328 --> 13:50.787
Where was I, boy?

13:51.914 --> 13:54.916
- Hockety, pockety?
- Yes. Yes, that's right.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.086
Hockety, pockety, wockety, wack
Odds and ends and bric a brac

13:58.170 --> 14:01.548
I'll be with you in a minute, son.
Packing's almost done.

14:06.053 --> 14:09.222
You... You bungling blockhead!

14:09.306 --> 14:12.267
Hey, easy there. No, go ahead.

14:12.351 --> 14:15.603
Dun goo-dily doo-dily doo-dily dun.
This is the best part.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.982
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum
Prestidigitonium

14:19.024 --> 14:22.235
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum
Prestidigitoni...

14:24.613 --> 14:26.573
What a way to pack.

14:27.575 --> 14:30.451
Well... Now, just a minute, boy.

14:30.536 --> 14:34.831
How else would you get all this stuff
into one suitcase, I'd like to know.

14:34.874 --> 14:39.002
- But I think it's wonderful.
- Yes, it is, rather.

14:40.921 --> 14:46.926
Now, don't you get any foolish ideas
that magic will solve all your problems.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.511
Because it won't!

14:48.554 --> 14:50.763
But sir, I don't have any problems.

14:50.848 --> 14:54.893
Everybody's got problems.
The world is full of problems.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.731
Blast it all.
There, now you see what I did?

15:07.698 --> 15:10.575
That's the trouble with the world today.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.536
Everybody butting their heads
against a brick wall.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.331
All muscle and no mentality.

15:16.415 --> 15:19.000
Do you want to be all muscle
and no brain?

15:19.084 --> 15:21.628
- I don't have any muscle.
- You don't?

15:21.712 --> 15:25.048
- Well, how do you move about?
- I suppose I do have a little.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.383
There, you see? Well, that's enough.

15:27.426 --> 15:30.970
Now, develop your brain. Knowledge,
wisdom, there's the real power.

15:31.055 --> 15:34.057
Higher learning, that's the thing.

15:37.019 --> 15:40.104
First thing tomorrow morning
we'll start a full schedule.

15:40.147 --> 15:41.439
Eight hours a day.

15:41.482 --> 15:45.401
We'll have six hours for school room
and two for study period.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.570
But I al...

15:47.613 --> 15:50.573
But I don't have the time.
I have page duties.

15:51.575 --> 15:52.992
Page duties?

15:57.331 --> 16:01.084
We'll change all that.
There's got to be a shake-up.

16:01.126 --> 16:04.545
Well, yes, sir. I suppose so.

16:04.630 --> 16:08.591
How do you expect to amount
to anything without an education?

16:08.634 --> 16:11.636
Even in these bungling,
backward medieval times

16:11.679 --> 16:15.348
you have got to know
where you're going, don't you?

16:16.892 --> 16:18.309
Yes, sir.

16:18.394 --> 16:19.727
Yes, of course.

16:19.812 --> 16:24.357
You must plan for the future, boy.
You've got to find a direction.

16:24.441 --> 16:26.275
And you've got...

16:28.070 --> 16:31.698
Now, by the by,
what direction is this castle of yours?

16:31.782 --> 16:33.908
I think it's north. The other way.

16:37.663 --> 16:41.332
All right. We'd better get a move on.
Come on, lad. Pick up the pace.

17:10.738 --> 17:13.031
The devil take it.

17:13.073 --> 17:15.825
The devil take it.
Anyone's got better sense

17:15.867 --> 17:19.203
than to go barging off
in that infernal forest alone.

17:19.788 --> 17:22.415
You had no business letting him go.

17:22.499 --> 17:24.541
Look, Dad,

17:24.585 --> 17:29.422
- I'm not the Wart's keeper.
- Well, blast it all, I am!

17:29.506 --> 17:33.676
After all, I took him in,
adopted the lad, you might say.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.429
Being his foster father, I'm responsible.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.730
Tiger, Talbert, off with you.

17:46.607 --> 17:50.109
Look here. What's the big idea
of gallivanting off in the woods

17:50.194 --> 17:53.988
- and worrying everybody?
- I'm sorry, sir.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.406
Well, sorry's not enough.

17:55.449 --> 17:59.368
That's four demerits,
four hours extra kitchen duty.

18:00.370 --> 18:03.164
- Report to the cook.
- But I'd like you to meet...

18:03.248 --> 18:06.000
Go on, hop it, boy. Hop, hop, hop it.

18:06.752 --> 18:10.088
You've got to keep a schedule
to run a place like this.

18:10.130 --> 18:14.092
You need strict rules,
especially for small boys.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.969
And I most certainly agree.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.263
Who are you, and...

18:19.348 --> 18:22.767
- I mean, you?
- My name is Merlin.

18:22.851 --> 18:27.146
And this is Archimedes,
the highly-educated owl.

18:28.482 --> 18:31.776
Educated owl?

18:31.819 --> 18:34.112
Say, that's a good one.

18:34.196 --> 18:37.115
Say, say, I know.

18:37.157 --> 18:39.826
You've got him under a spell, Marvin.

18:39.910 --> 18:44.288
- You're a magician.
- The name is Merlin.

18:45.290 --> 18:50.128
And I happen to be
the world's most powerful wizard.

18:51.338 --> 18:53.464
Come off it, man.

18:53.507 --> 18:58.094
- Gadzooks.
- All right. I shall demonstrate.

18:58.178 --> 19:01.139
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mo,

19:01.223 --> 19:04.642
wind and snow swirl and blow.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.646
What the devil are you up to?

19:09.565 --> 19:13.776
That is what I call a "wizard blizzard."

19:14.820 --> 19:17.071
Hey, Kay, would you look at this?

19:17.156 --> 19:18.865
An indoor blizzard.

19:18.949 --> 19:21.159
And in the month of July.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.451
So what?

19:23.829 --> 19:26.372
All right, Marvin, turn her off.

19:27.499 --> 19:29.125
I'm convinced.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.460
Alakazam.

19:33.380 --> 19:38.509
I hope you don't go in
for any of that black magic.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.511
Oh, no, no, no, no.

19:40.554 --> 19:42.680
Never touch the stuff.

19:42.764 --> 19:46.559
My magic is used mainly
for educational purposes.

19:49.563 --> 19:52.106
In fact, that is why I am here.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.318
I have come to educate the Wart.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.361
Oh, no, you don't.

19:57.404 --> 19:58.946
I'm running this place.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.282
If you think you're gonna
fiddle with my schedule,

20:01.366 --> 20:04.118
pack up your bag of tricks and be gone.

20:06.246 --> 20:10.208
Well, by Jove. Hey, he's gone.

20:11.627 --> 20:12.960
Good riddance.

20:13.045 --> 20:16.923
I'm gone, but then I'm not gone.

20:17.716 --> 20:22.970
So, if I do leave you can never be sure
that I am gone.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.306
- Can you?
- Well...

20:27.226 --> 20:30.686
Well, I must say,
you've got me there, Marvin.

20:32.356 --> 20:36.525
Where are you?
And you're welcome to stay, if you like.

20:36.568 --> 20:39.570
Thank you. You're very kind.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.448
Very generous, I must say.

20:42.532 --> 20:46.494
Well, all we can offer
is room and board.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.537
Hard times, you know, Marvin.

20:49.039 --> 20:52.917
We'll put you up in the northwest tower.
That's the guest room.

20:53.001 --> 20:56.087
It's drafty in the winter,
but in this hot weather

20:56.129 --> 20:58.172
it's the best room in the house.

20:58.257 --> 21:01.717
Oh, yes. Very lovely, indeed.

21:01.760 --> 21:05.054
So just make yourself at home, Marvin.

21:05.305 --> 21:07.848
Marvin? Marvin, Marvin, Marvin.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.617
Best room in the house!

21:27.411 --> 21:31.372
Guest room. Unwelcome guest room!

21:31.456 --> 21:35.751
If he thinks that he can get rid of me,
I've got news for that old walrus.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.878
I'm sticking it out!

21:37.963 --> 21:41.132
And I say we go back to the woods.

21:41.341 --> 21:43.759
No, not on your life.

21:43.802 --> 21:47.138
That boy's got to have an education.
He has a future.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.557
You may be right.

21:49.641 --> 21:53.602
A skinny kid like that would make
a cracking good chimney sweep.

21:58.317 --> 22:02.361
Something tells me
that you're all wet, Archimedes.

22:11.913 --> 22:14.415
- Who goes there?
- Pellinore.

22:14.499 --> 22:17.043
It's Pellinore, dash it all.

22:17.127 --> 22:21.380
I've got big news from London.
Big news.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.009
Come on, man. Drop the bridge.

22:34.853 --> 22:37.938
Well... Big news, eh?

22:38.857 --> 22:40.649
Well, can't wait for the London Times.

22:40.692 --> 22:45.029
First edition won't be out for at least,
12 hundred years.

22:45.614 --> 22:49.325
Archimedes, would you mind
sailing down there and...

22:49.368 --> 22:51.202
Not interested.

22:51.995 --> 22:55.081
Come, come, come, come now.
You're as wet as you can get.

22:55.165 --> 22:58.042
No. No, no, no.

22:58.543 --> 23:02.380
Archimedes, I'll turn you into a human.

23:02.923 --> 23:06.217
- You wouldn't dare.
- I will. So help me, I will.

23:06.259 --> 23:08.928
All right. All right. All right!

23:09.012 --> 23:10.513
All right.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.723
Works every time.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.600
Just like magic.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.905
Pellinore!

23:29.574 --> 23:33.411
Pellinore. Greetings, old boy.

23:33.495 --> 23:36.080
What's all the noise about London?

23:36.123 --> 23:39.583
Big news, really big news.

23:39.668 --> 23:42.420
Sit down, man,
and let's hear all about it.

23:42.504 --> 23:46.298
They're having a big tournament
New Year's Day.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.759
That's not news, dash it all.

23:48.802 --> 23:51.470
- They always do.
- But Ector, Ector,

23:51.555 --> 23:54.098
here's where
all the excitement comes in.

23:55.475 --> 23:59.770
To the winner of this tournament
goes the crown.

24:02.524 --> 24:05.901
You mean...
You mean he'll be king of all England?

24:06.862 --> 24:09.947
King of all England.

24:11.616 --> 24:13.534
Kay, lad, did you hear that?

24:14.035 --> 24:15.953
Pretty fair prize, I'd say.

24:15.996 --> 24:19.748
Yes, and you could win it, boy,
if you'd knuckle down to your training.

24:19.791 --> 24:23.794
We'll have you knighted by Christmas,
off to London. What do you say?

24:23.879 --> 24:27.006
Sure. Why not? Why not?

24:27.090 --> 24:29.967
Wart, lad,
how'd you like to go to London?

24:30.051 --> 24:31.635
Sir Ector, you mean it?

24:31.720 --> 24:34.346
If you stick to your duties
you can be Kay's squire.

24:34.431 --> 24:36.515
I will, sir, I will.

24:40.395 --> 24:43.647
I don't want the Wart for my squire.

24:43.732 --> 24:47.359
Here's to London, and here's to Kay.

24:47.444 --> 24:51.447
And here's to the banner
of the castle of the Forest Sauvage!

24:51.490 --> 24:53.324
- Cheers.
- Cheers, cheers.

25:10.675 --> 25:13.302
Charge!

25:13.762 --> 25:16.514
Wait, boy. Lean into it.

25:16.598 --> 25:20.184
Steady, boy, steady.
Steady with the lance.

25:20.268 --> 25:23.437
Do it, white knight! Hit him clean.

25:24.105 --> 25:26.732
No. No, no!

25:29.694 --> 25:31.987
Heads up!

25:36.326 --> 25:38.410
Archimedes?

25:38.495 --> 25:40.788
Archimedes, where are we?

25:40.872 --> 25:43.040
In a tumbled-down old tower

25:43.124 --> 25:47.378
in the most miserable old castle
in all Christendom, that's where.

25:48.088 --> 25:50.214
Castle? Castle?

25:50.298 --> 25:52.508
Don't you even remember the boy?

25:53.301 --> 25:54.510
The boy?

25:54.553 --> 25:57.304
Can't you remember one blasted thing?

25:57.389 --> 25:59.306
Now, just a moment. I...

25:59.391 --> 26:01.600
Tight grip on the lance.

26:01.685 --> 26:04.812
Loose in the saddle, knees in tight,

26:04.896 --> 26:07.856
weight forward and stay on target.

26:10.193 --> 26:12.570
You keep losing your grip.

26:13.071 --> 26:15.739
It's not a mere matter of muscle, son.

26:15.782 --> 26:18.909
Jousting is a fine skill.

26:18.994 --> 26:22.121
It... It's a highly developed science.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.374
Science, indeed.

26:25.417 --> 26:29.253
One dummy trying to knock off
another dummy with a bit of a stick.

26:29.337 --> 26:32.756
And the Wart's just as hot for it
as the rest of them.

26:32.841 --> 26:36.176
He certainly is.
That boy's got real spark.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.469
Lots of spirit.

26:37.554 --> 26:40.889
Throws himself heart and soul
into everything he does.

26:40.932 --> 26:45.477
That's really worth something if it can
be turned in the right direction.

26:46.104 --> 26:47.605
Fat chance of that.

26:49.107 --> 26:51.066
I plan to cheat, of course.

26:52.152 --> 26:53.193
Use magic.

26:53.278 --> 26:56.614
Every last trick in the trade if I have to.

27:07.334 --> 27:11.045
I'd give anything to go riding about
on a great white charger,

27:11.129 --> 27:15.090
slaying dragons and griffins
and man-eating giants.

27:15.717 --> 27:19.595
- Well, won't you?
- Oh, no.

27:19.638 --> 27:23.557
You see, I'm an orphan
and a knight must be of proper birth.

27:23.642 --> 27:26.518
I only hope I'm worthy
to be Kay's squire.

27:26.603 --> 27:28.854
That's a big job too, you know.

27:28.980 --> 27:30.856
Oh, indeed. Yes, yes.

27:30.940 --> 27:34.276
I would say almost impossible.

27:34.319 --> 27:38.697
Yes. Well, now then,
when I said I could swim like a fish,

27:38.782 --> 27:41.200
I really meant as a fish.

27:41.284 --> 27:44.995
You mean you can turn yourself
into a fish?

27:45.080 --> 27:47.873
After all, I happen to be a wizard.

27:47.957 --> 27:49.708
Could you turn me into a fish?

27:49.793 --> 27:54.088
Do you have any imagination?
Can you imagine yourself as a fish?

27:54.172 --> 27:55.881
That's easy.

27:55.965 --> 27:58.592
I've done that lots of times.

27:58.677 --> 28:02.221
Well, good. Then I think that my magic
can do the rest.

28:06.226 --> 28:08.727
Archimedes, what is that fish formula?

28:12.691 --> 28:14.358
Who? Who? What?

28:14.442 --> 28:16.902
You know, that Latin business.

28:16.986 --> 28:18.737
Fish? Latin?

28:20.865 --> 28:25.077
Aquarius, aquaticus, aqualitus.

28:25.161 --> 28:30.040
And now, if you don't mind,
I say good day to the both of you.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.667
If you please.

28:31.710 --> 28:36.463
When he stays out all night
he's always grumpy the next morning.

28:37.257 --> 28:39.883
- He must stay out every night.
- Yes, yes.

28:40.885 --> 28:44.638
Oh, yes. I say, that's very good, boy.

28:45.473 --> 28:47.516
Who? What, what?

28:47.559 --> 28:50.310
All right, boy. All set. Here we go.

28:50.395 --> 28:53.063
Aquarius, aquaticus, aqualitus quom.

28:53.148 --> 28:55.399
Aquadigitarium.

28:59.904 --> 29:02.573
Merlin, am I a fish? Am I a fish?

29:02.657 --> 29:05.117
Yes, yes, yes, you are a fish.

29:05.201 --> 29:07.828
If you don't stop
flipping and flopping around

29:07.912 --> 29:10.247
and get in the water you won't last long.

29:13.585 --> 29:18.088
Now, stay right here in the tules
and I'll be with you in a minute.

29:35.190 --> 29:38.776
So, you thought you could take right off
like a shot, did you?

29:43.198 --> 29:45.199
Well, I am a fish, aren't I?

29:46.701 --> 29:48.577
You merely look like a fish.

29:48.620 --> 29:51.038
That doesn't mean
you can swim like one.

29:51.122 --> 29:53.290
You don't have the instinct.

29:53.374 --> 29:57.795
So, you'll have to use your brain
for a change.

29:57.837 --> 30:00.297
You are living between two planes now,

30:00.381 --> 30:04.009
somewhere between the ceiling
and the floor.

30:07.055 --> 30:11.809
Now, there are lots of ups and downs,
like a helicopter.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.561
- Helicopter?
- Yes.

30:14.646 --> 30:17.523
It... It... No, never mind.

30:18.274 --> 30:21.735
Every flick of a fin creates movement.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.322
So, first we'll start with the caudal fin.

30:27.992 --> 30:30.118
No, no, boy. Your tail, tail.

30:35.250 --> 30:39.545
Now, that gives you the forward thrust.
Now, let's get a rhythm.

30:39.629 --> 30:43.215
Right, left, right, left

30:43.299 --> 30:46.760
One, two, left and right

30:46.845 --> 30:48.720
By day and night

30:48.805 --> 30:52.307
That's what makes the world go round

30:52.350 --> 30:56.061
In and out
Thin and stout

30:56.145 --> 30:59.690
That's what makes the world go round

30:59.774 --> 31:03.193
For every up there is a down

31:03.236 --> 31:05.445
- For every square
- There is a round?

31:05.530 --> 31:06.697
Yes.

31:06.781 --> 31:10.450
- For every high
- There is a low?

31:10.535 --> 31:11.869
And for every to

31:11.953 --> 31:13.328
- There is a...
- Fro.

31:13.371 --> 31:14.788
- Fro?
- Yes, fro.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.708
To and fro, stop and go

31:17.750 --> 31:21.670
That's what makes the world go round

31:21.713 --> 31:24.673
In and out
Thin and stout

31:24.716 --> 31:26.383
Merlin? Merlin?

31:26.426 --> 31:28.635
I swallowed a bug.

31:29.512 --> 31:32.764
What's wrong with that?
After all, boy, you are a fish.

31:32.849 --> 31:34.725
Instincts, you know.

31:34.809 --> 31:36.894
But you said I had no instinct.

31:36.978 --> 31:38.562
Yes.

31:38.813 --> 31:41.565
I did. That's neither here nor there.

31:41.649 --> 31:44.401
The main thing is, you must...

31:44.444 --> 31:47.446
Set your sights upon the heights

31:47.530 --> 31:50.073
Don't be a mediocrity

31:50.116 --> 31:52.284
- Mediocrity?
- That's right.

31:52.368 --> 31:55.078
Don't just wait and trust to fate

31:55.163 --> 31:58.415
And say that's how it's meant to be

31:58.458 --> 32:01.501
It's up to you how far you go

32:01.586 --> 32:04.713
If you don't try you'll never know

32:04.756 --> 32:07.758
And so, my lad, as I've explained

32:07.842 --> 32:11.011
Nothing ventured, nothing gained

32:24.609 --> 32:29.279
Let's... Let's swim through
that tall grass again. It tickles.

32:39.374 --> 32:41.708
I beg your pardon.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.168
Me, too.

32:43.252 --> 32:45.921
For every to there is a fro

32:45.964 --> 32:48.674
For every stop there is a go

32:48.758 --> 32:52.344
And that's what makes
the world go round

32:52.428 --> 32:54.721
Let go, let go, let go.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.309
You big bug-eyed bully, you.

32:59.352 --> 33:01.186
Who, me?

33:01.270 --> 33:04.106
Here, here, here, here, here now, boy.

33:04.148 --> 33:06.692
No sense going around
insulting bullfrogs.

33:07.735 --> 33:11.029
A fish has plenty of other problems
without that.

33:11.114 --> 33:14.491
The water world has its forests
and its jungles, too.

33:14.534 --> 33:17.619
So, it has its tigers and its wolves.

33:17.870 --> 33:18.996
But that...

33:19.080 --> 33:21.999
That's what makes the world go round

33:22.041 --> 33:24.501
You see, my boy
it's nature's way

33:24.585 --> 33:27.462
Upon the weak
the strong ones prey

33:27.505 --> 33:30.340
In human life, it's also true

33:30.383 --> 33:33.218
The strong will try to conquer you

33:33.302 --> 33:35.846
That is what you must expect

33:35.930 --> 33:38.849
Unless you use your intellect

33:38.933 --> 33:41.351
Brains and brawn
Weak and strong

33:41.394 --> 33:44.438
- Merlin, help, help!
- That's what makes the worl...

33:44.772 --> 33:46.523
Jehoshaphat!

33:54.699 --> 33:58.577
- Quick, Merlin, the magic.
- No, no, you're on your own, lad.

33:58.661 --> 34:02.789
- Now's your chance to prove my point.
- What point?

34:02.874 --> 34:06.710
He's the brawn and you're the brain.
Now, don't panic!

34:06.753 --> 34:10.005
You use your head.
Outsmart the big brute.

34:12.884 --> 34:16.053
Smart move, lad.
That's using the old intellect.

35:00.598 --> 35:03.391
Bravo, boy. Great strategy.

35:03.434 --> 35:07.104
- Is the lesson about over?
- Did you get the point?

35:07.146 --> 35:09.481
Yes, yes, brain over brawn.

35:09.565 --> 35:11.316
OK, lad, I'll fix the big brute.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.110
Higgly piggly... No, no.

35:13.152 --> 35:15.445
Hocus pocus... No! What the blazes...

35:15.530 --> 35:18.115
- Hey didda dihicka...
- Merlin!

35:20.785 --> 35:22.369
Now what?

35:23.162 --> 35:25.914
Is it that, that boy?

35:26.165 --> 35:29.000
- What in blazes...
- Help, help!

35:29.085 --> 35:42.597
Help!

35:47.395 --> 35:49.271
Archimedes!

35:49.313 --> 35:50.856
Help!

36:17.383 --> 36:19.467
What... What in...

36:19.510 --> 36:22.512
What in thunder is a monster like that
doing in the moat?

36:22.597 --> 36:24.598
By George, I...

36:25.516 --> 36:27.184
I'll turn him into a minnow.

36:27.268 --> 36:30.520
- Merlin.
- There you are, boy.

36:30.730 --> 36:33.398
Snick, snack, snorrel.

36:33.482 --> 36:36.860
How in the world
did you ever get out of that mess?

36:36.903 --> 36:39.529
That big fish almost swallowed me,

36:39.614 --> 36:42.282
and Archimedes, he, he saved me.

36:42.366 --> 36:44.034
Well, by Jove.

36:44.118 --> 36:46.953
Now, what do you know about that?

36:47.038 --> 36:50.707
I... I did nothing of the sort!

36:50.791 --> 36:52.876
I intended to eat him.

36:52.919 --> 36:55.212
Young perch is my favorite dish.

36:55.254 --> 36:56.588
You know that.

36:59.550 --> 37:02.260
- Do you believe that, Wart?
- Well, I...

37:02.345 --> 37:04.638
Wart! Wart!

37:04.722 --> 37:07.224
I've got to go. Thank you, Merlin.

37:07.308 --> 37:10.018
It was so much fun. And Archimedes, I...

37:10.061 --> 37:12.729
- Pin feathers, boy.
- Wart!

37:12.772 --> 37:15.899
- Where are you, Wart?
- Coming! I'm coming.

37:15.942 --> 37:19.069
Now, Archimedes,

37:19.153 --> 37:23.490
why would you half drown yourself
for a tidbit of fish?

37:23.574 --> 37:26.409
And after such a big breakfast.

37:26.452 --> 37:30.205
Pin feathers and gully fluff.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.833
We were doing fine
until we got in deep water.

37:33.918 --> 37:38.421
Then along comes this huge pike
with big jaws and sharp jagged teeth.

37:38.464 --> 37:41.841
- Turn him off, Dad.
- He was a monster.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.510
The biggest fish I ever saw.

37:43.594 --> 37:47.764
And, boy, that's the biggest fish story
I ever heard.

37:47.848 --> 37:51.518
- But it's true, sir.
- That's three demerits for being late

37:51.602 --> 37:54.187
and three more for the fish story.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.897
Now, hop it to the kitchen!

37:56.732 --> 37:59.651
I told you the Wart was loony.

37:59.735 --> 38:04.614
He's either out of his head or
there's something fishy going on here.

38:06.867 --> 38:10.370
For every high there is a low

38:10.454 --> 38:14.082
For every to there is a fro

38:14.125 --> 38:17.544
To and fro
Stop and go

38:17.628 --> 38:20.922
That's what makes the world go round

38:22.425 --> 38:25.969
- It's you, Merlin, sir.
- Yes, my lad.

38:26.012 --> 38:30.724
Now, have you ever considered
being a squirrel?

38:30.808 --> 38:34.019
- No, I don't suppose.
- Well, now,

38:34.103 --> 38:38.398
there is a tiny creature
with enormous problems.

38:38.482 --> 38:41.818
How he has survived
throughout the ages

38:41.861 --> 38:44.779
is one of nature's big mysteries.

38:44.822 --> 38:47.615
His life is hazardous.

38:47.658 --> 38:49.492
Downright dangerous.

38:51.245 --> 38:52.954
Would you like to try it?

38:52.997 --> 38:54.456
No, I'd better not.

38:56.834 --> 38:59.502
Too dangerous for you, eh?

38:59.545 --> 39:01.755
No, it's not that.

39:01.839 --> 39:05.175
It's just that I've got six demerits.
All this work to do.

39:05.259 --> 39:07.510
What a mess.

39:07.845 --> 39:11.014
What a medieval muddle.
We'll have to modernize it.

39:11.098 --> 39:13.600
Start an assembly line system.

39:15.353 --> 39:16.936
All right, now.

39:17.021 --> 39:19.147
A one and a two and a three and a four.

39:27.031 --> 39:30.992
Higitus, figitus, migitus, mum
Tittendy, bittendy, buttondy, dum

39:35.039 --> 39:36.998
But I'm supposed to do it.

39:37.041 --> 39:38.958
No one will know the difference, son

39:39.043 --> 39:41.086
Who cares
as long as the work gets done?

39:46.801 --> 39:50.970
Rubbety, scrubbety, sweepity, flew

39:54.183 --> 39:57.102
Come on, son, let's go, let's go.

40:14.203 --> 40:18.081
Wart!

40:18.165 --> 40:21.126
Wart, take it easy. Take it easy, boy.

40:21.210 --> 40:24.170
Wart! Oh, no, boy. No, no!

40:24.255 --> 40:27.340
- Wart!
- Wha... Wait. Whoa!

40:28.092 --> 40:31.803
Now, what did I tell you?
Always look before you leap.

40:31.887 --> 40:34.597
Well, I made it, didn't I?

40:34.640 --> 40:36.683
Yes, yes, you made it, you made it.

40:36.767 --> 40:40.145
But you can't always trust to luck, boy.

40:40.229 --> 40:45.108
Now, first you start with the short jumps.

40:45.151 --> 40:48.486
Gauge the distance carefully and...

40:51.532 --> 40:54.659
There, you see?
Even then you can miss.

40:54.743 --> 40:58.913
So, don't take gravity too lightly
or it'll catch up with you.

40:58.956 --> 41:02.792
- What's gravity?
- Gravity's what causes you to fall.

41:02.835 --> 41:06.671
- Like a stumble or a trip?
- Yes, like a stumble or a...

41:06.755 --> 41:09.799
No, no, no.
It's the force that pulls you downward.

41:09.842 --> 41:14.596
The phenomenon that
any two material particles or bodies,

41:14.638 --> 41:19.267
if free to move,
will be accelerated toward each other.

41:35.034 --> 41:36.993
Merlin, how will we get by?

41:38.954 --> 41:42.415
Well, I suppose we better go back
to a sidetrack.

41:46.378 --> 41:49.297
Go on, go on. You've got lots of room.

41:53.219 --> 41:56.471
Well, I guess she can't be sidetracked.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.557
That's a girl squirrel
and a redhead, at that.

42:11.904 --> 42:14.989
- She sure acts funny.
- She likes you.

42:15.032 --> 42:16.407
Why?

42:17.910 --> 42:20.286
Yes, well. Well, that's nature again.

42:20.371 --> 42:23.122
But I'm afraid there's no time to explain.

42:23.207 --> 42:25.667
Here now,
you'd better leave me out of it.

42:27.836 --> 42:29.879
Yeah. Me, too.

42:31.632 --> 42:32.924
Merlin.

42:33.008 --> 42:35.593
- Merlin!
- You're on your own, lad.

42:35.678 --> 42:38.346
I'm afraid magic
can't solve this problem.

42:39.765 --> 42:42.350
Look, I'm not a boy... I mean...

42:42.393 --> 42:45.103
I'm not a squirrel, I'm a boy.

42:45.187 --> 42:47.855
A human boy, not a real sq...

42:50.901 --> 42:52.485
Leave me alone.

42:54.738 --> 42:57.824
Merlin, what will I do?
She won't leave me...

43:01.078 --> 43:05.915
Well, I'm afraid you're stuck, lad.
When a girl squirrel chooses a mate,

43:05.958 --> 43:07.333
it's for life.

43:07.418 --> 43:09.502
But I won't be a squirrel tomorrow.

43:09.587 --> 43:13.047
She doesn't know that.
She only knows one simple fact,

43:13.090 --> 43:15.925
that you're a him and she's a her.

43:17.177 --> 43:19.262
It's a natural phenomenon.

43:19.346 --> 43:20.763
Phenomenon?

43:20.848 --> 43:22.724
Well, it's the...

43:24.685 --> 43:27.770
It's a state of being, a frame of mind

43:27.813 --> 43:30.648
It's a most befuddling thing

43:30.733 --> 43:33.568
And to every being
Of every kind

43:33.611 --> 43:35.862
It is discomboomerating

43:36.697 --> 43:39.657
You're wasting time resisting

43:39.742 --> 43:42.660
You'll find the more you do

43:42.745 --> 43:45.622
The more she'll keep insisting

43:45.664 --> 43:48.625
Her "him" has got to be you

43:48.709 --> 43:50.168
Now, leave me alone.

43:50.252 --> 43:51.628
I mean it!

43:51.712 --> 43:54.255
It's a rough game, anyone knows

43:54.298 --> 43:55.965
Go away!

43:57.676 --> 44:00.303
There are no rules
Anything goes

44:00.387 --> 44:06.643
There's no logical explanation
for this discomboomeration

44:06.685 --> 44:10.980
It's a most bemuddling
most befuddling thing

44:15.319 --> 44:17.737
Who? Who? What the...

44:17.821 --> 44:20.990
Now, go on, shoo.
Get a tree of your own.

44:21.033 --> 44:22.617
Skedaddle.

44:51.855 --> 44:53.731
You squirrelly squirrels!

44:55.776 --> 44:57.568
She's gaining on you, Wart.

44:59.655 --> 45:04.659
There's no sensible explanation
for this discomboomeration

45:04.702 --> 45:07.912
It's a most hodgepodge-ical
most illogical

45:07.996 --> 45:10.581
Most confuse-ling, most bamboozling

45:10.666 --> 45:14.877
Most bemuddling
Most befuddling

45:14.962 --> 45:16.713
Thing

45:20.676 --> 45:23.302
Really, now, Miss...

45:23.387 --> 45:24.846
Madam, I...

45:25.681 --> 45:27.473
You, you've made a mistake.

45:27.558 --> 45:30.226
Now, now, now, please.

45:30.269 --> 45:32.145
Madam. Madam!

45:36.233 --> 45:37.358
Look here.

45:37.401 --> 45:41.154
I am not a boy.
I mean, I am not a squirrel.

45:41.238 --> 45:42.822
I'm a boy.

45:42.906 --> 45:44.532
No, that's not what I meant.

45:44.575 --> 45:46.284
No!

45:46.368 --> 45:49.412
No, I'm a stupid old...

45:49.496 --> 45:50.913
No!

45:52.207 --> 45:54.041
I'm an old man.

45:54.084 --> 45:56.127
An old hu... man.

45:57.212 --> 45:58.421
Understand?

46:02.718 --> 46:05.303
Hang it all. Now, go away.

46:14.313 --> 46:17.231
Impossible. Impossible.

46:20.235 --> 46:22.111
Confound it.

46:22.154 --> 46:24.363
Confound it all!

46:25.949 --> 46:30.411
Merlin, I'm tired of being a squirrel.
It's nothing but trouble.

46:30.454 --> 46:33.623
You've got trouble? Look at my...
Look back there!

46:35.584 --> 46:37.043
One side, lad.

46:40.547 --> 46:43.132
Help, Merlin, help!

47:42.276 --> 47:43.693
By George!

47:47.489 --> 47:50.032
I've had enough of this nonsense.

47:51.243 --> 47:52.702
Alakazam.

47:56.456 --> 48:01.669
There. You see? I'm an ugly, horrible,
grouchy old man.

48:09.177 --> 48:10.553
Merlin.

48:12.848 --> 48:15.391
- So, here we are.
- Quick, Merlin, the magic.

48:15.434 --> 48:17.643
Snick, snack, snorrel.

48:19.897 --> 48:23.900
There. Now you see? I'm not a squirrel.

48:23.942 --> 48:25.401
I'm a boy.

48:26.695 --> 48:30.031
I tried to tell you. I'm a boy.

48:30.073 --> 48:31.991
A human boy.

48:34.494 --> 48:36.871
If you could only understand.

48:47.925 --> 48:51.302
You know, lad,
that love business is a powerful thing.

48:55.432 --> 48:57.683
Greater than gravity?

48:57.768 --> 49:00.436
Well, yes, boy, in its way.

49:00.479 --> 49:05.232
I'd... Yes, I'd say it's
the greatest force on earth.

49:17.329 --> 49:19.580
Ector! Ector!

49:19.623 --> 49:21.999
Sir Ector, the kitchen!

49:22.084 --> 49:23.376
Hold it, son.

49:23.460 --> 49:26.754
- Madness all over the place.
- Kay!

49:26.797 --> 49:28.923
Hold that, I say.

49:34.304 --> 49:37.306
Now, what's all the commotion?

49:37.391 --> 49:40.685
The kitchen, it's under an evil spell.

49:40.769 --> 49:42.061
It's bewitched.

49:42.145 --> 49:45.022
No! I bet it's that old goat, Marvin.

49:45.148 --> 49:47.817
Come on, son.
I knew he'd give us trouble.

49:53.615 --> 49:55.241
Gadzooks!

49:56.743 --> 49:58.661
Black magic of the worst kind!

49:58.704 --> 50:01.205
Come on, Kay, to the attack!

50:19.725 --> 50:21.726
Heaven preserve us!

50:23.103 --> 50:24.353
Kay!

50:43.749 --> 50:47.668
- Now, what have we here?
- Jumpin' hop toads.

50:48.336 --> 50:51.005
Alakazam!

50:55.802 --> 50:58.054
So there you are, you old goat.

50:59.973 --> 51:04.560
What's the idea of flinging
your evil spells all over the place?

51:04.603 --> 51:06.520
Lend me a hand, boy.

51:11.443 --> 51:14.445
Well, what have you got
to say for yourself?

51:15.238 --> 51:19.784
You call washing dishes
and sweeping floors a work of evil?

51:19.868 --> 51:22.995
I'll decide what's right and wrong
around here.

51:23.080 --> 51:25.831
Besides, that's the Wart's job,
one of his duties.

51:26.750 --> 51:28.167
Look here, boy.

51:28.251 --> 51:31.587
If you want to make that trip to London,
you'd better toe the mark.

51:31.630 --> 51:33.255
You old goat!

51:33.340 --> 51:36.717
If I ever catch you
in my kitchen again, I'll...

51:36.760 --> 51:39.762
Madam, you won't.

51:40.430 --> 51:41.680
Oh, dear.

51:41.765 --> 51:43.641
He's gone.

51:44.101 --> 51:45.810
Well, by Jove.

51:45.894 --> 51:48.646
We ought to run the old geezer
right out of the castle.

51:48.730 --> 51:51.649
Oh, no. No, no, Kay, no.

51:51.733 --> 51:54.401
He might cast an evil spell
on the lot of us.

51:54.444 --> 51:56.779
Turn us all into stone.

51:56.822 --> 51:59.782
No, there's no telling
what the old devil might do.

51:59.866 --> 52:01.534
He's not an old devil!

52:01.618 --> 52:05.746
He... He's good
and his magic is good, too.

52:05.789 --> 52:09.208
- If... If you just leave him alone.
- Now, look here, Wart.

52:09.292 --> 52:12.711
- That's three more demerits.
- Box his ears, Dad.

52:12.796 --> 52:17.299
Just because you can't understand
something, it doesn't mean it's wrong.

52:17.342 --> 52:18.884
Ten more demerits!

52:18.969 --> 52:21.887
You make all the rules
and nobody else can say anything.

52:21.972 --> 52:23.722
You've said a-plenty, boy.

52:23.807 --> 52:26.809
All that popping off
just cooked your goose. Kay!

52:27.352 --> 52:30.104
From now on,
young Hobbs is your squire.

52:30.147 --> 52:31.480
Did you hear that, Wart?

52:31.565 --> 52:35.484
Hobbs is going to be Kay's squire.

52:35.694 --> 52:37.111
Yes, sir.

52:37.154 --> 52:40.364
That will teach you to pop off,
you little pipsqueak.

52:53.670 --> 52:55.713
I'm sorry, lad.

52:55.797 --> 52:58.674
I'm sorry. I spoiled everything.

52:58.717 --> 53:02.178
I know that trip to London
means a great deal to you.

53:02.220 --> 53:04.346
It's not your fault.

53:04.389 --> 53:06.348
I shouldn't have popped off.

53:06.391 --> 53:08.517
Now I'm really done for.

53:08.602 --> 53:11.312
No, no, you're in a great spot, boy.

53:11.354 --> 53:14.648
You can't go down now.
It can only be up from here.

53:14.691 --> 53:16.358
I'd like to know how.

53:16.443 --> 53:17.860
Use your head.

53:17.903 --> 53:19.820
An education, lad.

53:21.198 --> 53:25.784
- What good will that do?
- Get it first, then, who knows?

53:25.869 --> 53:27.328
Are you willing to try?

53:28.538 --> 53:30.873
Well, what have I got to lose?

53:30.916 --> 53:33.459
That's the spirit. We'll start tomorrow.

53:33.543 --> 53:35.794
We'll show 'em, won't we, boy?

53:35.879 --> 53:37.630
We sure will.

53:39.382 --> 53:41.884
Now, first of all, lad,

53:41.968 --> 53:45.512
we've got to get all of these
medieval ideas out of your head.

53:45.931 --> 53:48.390
Clear the way for new ideas.

53:48.475 --> 53:53.646
Knowledge of man's fabulous
discoveries in the centuries ahead.

53:53.730 --> 53:55.856
Now, that will be a great advantage.

53:55.899 --> 53:57.816
Advantage, indeed!

53:57.901 --> 54:01.946
If the boy says the world is round
they'll take him for a lunatic.

54:02.030 --> 54:04.907
- The world is round?
- Yes, yes, that's right.

54:04.991 --> 54:08.452
And it also goes around.

54:11.456 --> 54:15.251
- You mean, it'll be round someday?
- No, no, no. It's round now.

54:15.293 --> 54:18.128
Man will discover this
in centuries to come.

54:18.213 --> 54:19.964
And he will also find

54:20.048 --> 54:25.177
that the world is merely a tiny speck
in the universe.

54:25.262 --> 54:28.347
- Universe?
- You're only confusing the boy.

54:28.431 --> 54:32.393
He'll be so mixed up he'll...
He'll be wearing his shoes on his head.

54:32.435 --> 54:34.687
Man has always learned from the past.

54:34.771 --> 54:37.106
After all, you can't learn history
in reverse.

54:37.190 --> 54:39.942
It's confusing enough,
for heaven's sakes.

54:40.235 --> 54:42.736
All right. All right.

54:43.196 --> 54:46.448
Have it your way, Archimedes.
You're in charge.

54:46.491 --> 54:48.367
You're the headmaster now.

54:48.451 --> 54:50.953
So, from now on he's your pupil.

54:52.622 --> 54:56.083
So, from now on, boy,

54:56.126 --> 54:58.043
you do as I say.

54:58.128 --> 55:00.045
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

55:00.130 --> 55:04.300
Now, to start off,
I want you to read these books.

55:04.384 --> 55:05.634
All of them?

55:05.719 --> 55:08.971
That, my boy,
is a mountain of knowledge.

55:09.055 --> 55:12.224
- But I can't read.
- What, what? What!

55:12.309 --> 55:15.144
- I don't suppose you know how to write?
- No, sir.

55:15.186 --> 55:17.646
- Well, what do you know?
- Well, I...

55:17.731 --> 55:21.650
Never mind, never mind.
We'll start at the bottom. The ABC's.

55:22.902 --> 55:26.739
First the A and now the B.

55:26.823 --> 55:30.492
Loop and around and there's the C.

55:30.994 --> 55:33.620
Merlin, look. I can write!

55:33.663 --> 55:36.332
Oh, yes, yes. That's very good, boy.

55:36.374 --> 55:38.500
Hen scratch, that's all. Hen scratch.

55:38.543 --> 55:42.087
Now, come on. D, E, F.

55:42.172 --> 55:44.340
And now the G.

55:44.382 --> 55:48.010
You see, it's as simple as...
No, no, no, no, boy!

55:48.053 --> 55:52.389
Use your head, use your head, will you?
How do you expect to learn anything?

55:52.474 --> 55:53.557
Archimedes.

55:53.641 --> 55:59.188
Have you seen
that flying machine model?

55:59.230 --> 56:03.359
I have nothing to do with your
futuristic fiddle-faddle, you know that.

56:03.443 --> 56:06.070
What's that thing up there?

56:06.154 --> 56:09.031
Yes, of course. Here we are.

56:09.074 --> 56:11.867
Do you mean man will fly
in one of those someday?

56:11.910 --> 56:15.829
If man were meant to fly,
he'd have been born with wings.

56:16.498 --> 56:21.710
I am about to prove otherwise,
Archimedes, if you care to watch.

56:22.545 --> 56:24.588
Here she goes!

56:26.174 --> 56:27.716
No, no, no!

56:30.720 --> 56:32.554
Man will fly, all right.

56:33.515 --> 56:34.848
Just like a rock.

56:37.977 --> 56:42.731
It would have worked if...
If it weren't for this infernal beard.

56:53.952 --> 56:55.828
I never...

56:55.912 --> 56:58.789
Never in my whole...

57:04.087 --> 57:07.423
Man will fly someday, I tell you.

57:07.507 --> 57:10.467
I have been there. I have seen it.

57:10.552 --> 57:15.097
I do hope so.
I've always dreamed about flying.

57:15.140 --> 57:18.684
That I was a bird and that
I could go sailing all over the sky,

57:18.768 --> 57:20.436
high above everything.

57:20.520 --> 57:24.106
Avis alitus avita atheta.
Prestidigitonium.

57:24.149 --> 57:26.275
It's my favorite dream.

57:26.359 --> 57:29.903
But then, I suppose
everybody dreams about flying.

57:31.072 --> 57:33.532
I'm a bird, I'm a bird, I'm a bird!

57:33.867 --> 57:37.035
Hold it, boy. Not so fast, not so fast.

57:37.120 --> 57:41.123
First, I'd better explain
the mechanics of a bird's wing.

57:41.166 --> 57:44.710
Now, these large feathers

57:44.794 --> 57:48.130
are called the primaries, and...

57:48.173 --> 57:52.926
And since when do you know
all about birds' wings?

57:52.969 --> 57:56.889
I have made an extensive study
of birds in flight and I...

57:56.973 --> 58:00.976
And if you don't mind,
I happen to be a bird.

58:01.060 --> 58:05.189
All right, Mr. Know-it-All!
He's your pupil.

58:06.733 --> 58:11.820
Now, boy, flying is not merely
some crude mechanical process.

58:14.157 --> 58:17.868
It is a delicate art, purely aesthetic,

58:17.952 --> 58:19.661
poetry of motion.

58:19.704 --> 58:22.164
And the best way to learn it is to do it.

58:22.248 --> 58:26.168
Now, since we're pretty far up,
we'll start with a glide.

58:26.211 --> 58:29.213
Spread your wings way out. Way out!

58:29.297 --> 58:30.631
That's it, that's it.

58:30.673 --> 58:33.175
Now, fan your tail.

58:33.259 --> 58:37.179
Tippety toe, tippety toe and off we go.

58:40.350 --> 58:42.643
Now, tuck your feet under like me.

58:42.685 --> 58:45.604
That's it. That's the idea.

58:46.689 --> 58:48.190
Whoa. What?

58:48.274 --> 58:51.610
And don't fight the air currents.
Use them.

59:03.122 --> 59:05.624
Why, say, boy!

59:05.708 --> 59:07.751
That's pretty good.

59:07.835 --> 59:10.879
Well, boy, you're a natural.

59:10.922 --> 59:14.383
Are you sure this is
the first time that you...

59:14.634 --> 59:17.010
Wart, Wart, hawk, hawk!

59:17.053 --> 59:20.556
Look out, boy, heads up!
Come on, Wart!

59:22.058 --> 59:23.934
Archimedes, help!

59:29.524 --> 59:32.985
Wart! Wart!

59:44.080 --> 59:45.914
What?

59:53.756 --> 59:56.049
Sounds like someone's sick.

59:56.092 --> 59:57.968
How lovely.

59:58.052 --> 59:59.970
I do hope it's serious.

01:00:00.054 --> 01:00:02.347
Something dreadful.

01:00:03.308 --> 01:00:04.391
Bat gizzards.

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:08.604
It's nothing but a scrawny little sparrow
with a beak full of soot.

01:00:08.688 --> 01:00:12.107
I'm not really a sparrow. I'm a boy.

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:13.942
A boy?

01:00:14.027 --> 01:00:18.071
Merlin changed me with his magic.
He's the world's most powerful wizard.

01:00:18.114 --> 01:00:20.115
Merlin!

01:00:20.199 --> 01:00:23.827
Merlin.
The world's most powerful bungler.

01:00:23.911 --> 01:00:27.080
Why, boy, I've got more magic
in one little finger.

01:00:28.583 --> 01:00:32.836
Now, don't tell me you've never heard
of the marvelous Madam Mim?

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:35.547
Well, no, I don't guess so.

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:37.049
Madam Mim!

01:00:37.592 --> 01:00:38.842
Good heavens.

01:00:38.926 --> 01:00:41.094
Why, boy, I'm the greatest.

01:00:41.137 --> 01:00:43.388
I'm truly marvelous.

01:00:43.765 --> 01:00:48.143
With only a touch
I have the power

01:00:48.227 --> 01:00:49.728
Zim zabberim bim

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:52.272
To wither a flower

01:00:52.315 --> 01:00:55.692
I find delight
in the gruesome and grim

01:00:55.777 --> 01:00:58.445
- That's terrible.
- Thank you, my boy.

01:00:58.488 --> 01:01:02.157
But that's nothing, nothing for me.

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:07.204
'Cause I'm the magnificent, marvelous
mad Madam Mim

01:01:07.288 --> 01:01:10.874
You know what?
I can even change size.

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:13.293
I can be huge

01:01:14.003 --> 01:01:15.545
Fill the whole house

01:01:16.881 --> 01:01:19.883
I can be teeny
small as a mouse

01:01:19.967 --> 01:01:23.595
Black sorcery is my dish of tea

01:01:25.723 --> 01:01:27.641
It comes easy to me

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:32.020
'Cause I'm the magnificent, marvelous
mad Madam Mim

01:01:35.149 --> 01:01:38.276
Marvelous, boy.
Marvelous, I'm marvelous.

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:44.950
Say, lad, did you know
that I can make myself uglier yet?

01:01:45.618 --> 01:01:47.994
That would be some trick.

01:01:48.454 --> 01:01:50.747
- I mean...
- Want to bet?

01:01:53.042 --> 01:01:55.127
You see? I win, I win!

01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:57.713
Aren't I hideous, boy?

01:01:57.797 --> 01:02:01.258
- Perfectly revolting?
- Well... Yes, ma'am.

01:02:01.342 --> 01:02:04.386
But you ain't seen nothin' yet.
Watch this.

01:02:06.097 --> 01:02:10.267
I can be beautiful
Lovely and fair

01:02:10.351 --> 01:02:14.604
Silvery voice
Long purple hair

01:02:14.689 --> 01:02:18.567
La la la-la
La la la la-la

01:02:18.651 --> 01:02:22.654
La la-la la la
La-la la-la la la

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:27.075
But it's only skin-deep
Zim zabberim zim

01:02:27.118 --> 01:02:29.703
I'm an ugly old creep

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:35.083
The magnificent, marvelous
mad, mad, mad, mad Madam Mim

01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:40.005
Now what do you think, boy?

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:41.631
Who's the greatest?

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:46.887
Well, Merlin's magic is always,

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:50.599
well, useful for something good.

01:02:50.641 --> 01:02:53.643
And he must see
something good in you.

01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:55.187
I suppose so.

01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:57.564
Yes, and in my book that's bad.

01:02:58.691 --> 01:03:03.111
So, my boy,
I'm afraid I'll have to destroy you.

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:05.030
De... Destroy me?

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:07.657
Yeah, I'll give you a sporting chance.

01:03:07.742 --> 01:03:10.786
I'm mad about games, you know.

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:13.038
Well, come on. Get going, boy.

01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:15.582
You gotta keep on your toes
in this game.

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:28.178
I win, I win!

01:03:28.262 --> 01:03:29.429
The game's over.

01:03:32.767 --> 01:03:34.601
Why, you little devil, you!

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:37.229
I'll wring your scrawny little neck.

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.773
Mim. Mim!

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:42.192
What... What are you up to?

01:03:42.276 --> 01:03:44.110
Oh, Merlin.

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:48.323
Well, you're just in time.
We were playing a little game.

01:03:48.407 --> 01:03:50.283
She was going to destroy me.

01:03:50.368 --> 01:03:53.537
And just what are you gonna do
about it?

01:03:53.621 --> 01:03:57.165
Want to fight?
Want to have a wizards' duel?

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:00.335
As you wish, Madam.

01:04:00.378 --> 01:04:03.421
Well, come on. Step outside.

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:05.423
After you, Madam.

01:04:17.937 --> 01:04:20.647
What... What's up, boy?
What's going on?

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:23.191
They're having a wizards' duel.
What's that?

01:04:23.276 --> 01:04:24.860
It's a battle of wits.

01:04:24.902 --> 01:04:27.612
The players change themselves
to different things

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:32.409
- and attempt to destroy one another.
- De... Destroy?

01:04:32.493 --> 01:04:34.661
Just watch, boy. You'll get the idea.

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:40.166
First, if you don't mind,

01:04:40.209 --> 01:04:43.044
- I'll make the rules.
- Rules, indeed.

01:04:43.129 --> 01:04:45.589
She only wants rules
so she can break them.

01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:49.009
I'll take care of you later, featherbrain.

01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:52.429
Rule one, no mineral or vegetable.

01:04:52.513 --> 01:04:53.763
Only animal.

01:04:53.848 --> 01:04:58.768
Rule two, no make-believe things
like, pink dragons and stuff.

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:02.063
Rule three, no disappearing.

01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:05.191
No. Rule four, no cheating.

01:05:05.234 --> 01:05:07.903
All right, all right. Now, pace off 10.

01:05:09.488 --> 01:05:13.074
One, two, three, four...

01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:15.702
Merlin, she disappeared.

01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:18.788
Mim, now, you made the rules.

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:35.138
Change to something else, Merlin.

01:05:35.222 --> 01:05:37.557
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Give me time to think.

01:05:39.894 --> 01:05:41.937
Higgity figgity... No, no.

01:05:41.979 --> 01:05:43.438
Quick, Merlin, hurry!

01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:45.440
Hoppity hip.

01:05:49.737 --> 01:05:51.321
Madam, just a minute.

01:05:51.405 --> 01:05:53.114
This is not...

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.873
- Come on, something bigger.
- Something smaller.

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:03.875
Mim... Mim...

01:06:11.175 --> 01:06:12.884
Merlin?

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:15.011
No disappearing.

01:06:38.911 --> 01:06:40.412
Mim? Mim?

01:06:40.496 --> 01:06:43.790
Are you... What's going on here?

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:46.167
You... You big blimp.

01:06:57.805 --> 01:06:59.848
Squash me, will ya?

01:07:06.522 --> 01:07:07.689
Merlin.

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:12.152
Bravo.

01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:17.907
Just you wait, just you wait.
You're gonna pay.

01:07:33.966 --> 01:07:37.343
So, you want to play rough, do you?

01:07:39.889 --> 01:07:41.389
All right, Merlin.

01:07:41.474 --> 01:07:45.101
I'll smash you good, you old crab.

01:07:45.811 --> 01:07:47.562
Jehoshaphat.

01:07:49.315 --> 01:07:53.109
Here I come, Mim, ready or not.

01:07:55.446 --> 01:07:57.113
Merlin, you wouldn't dare.

01:07:57.198 --> 01:07:59.282
Merlin!

01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:11.961
Now, Mim, Mim,
no dragons, remember?

01:08:12.046 --> 01:08:16.006
Did I say no purple dragons? Did I?

01:08:30.356 --> 01:08:33.108
I win, I win!

01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:36.944
That horrible old witch.
I'll peck her eyes out.

01:08:36.987 --> 01:08:38.279
No, no.

01:08:42.158 --> 01:08:44.452
- He's gone.
- Disappeared.

01:08:44.495 --> 01:08:46.787
Madam, I have not disappeared.

01:08:46.831 --> 01:08:48.915
I am very tiny.

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:52.252
I am a germ, a rare disease.

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:55.130
I'm called Malagalee Telopterosis.

01:08:55.171 --> 01:08:57.715
And you caught me, Mim.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.175
What?

01:09:00.094 --> 01:09:02.886
First, you break out into spots.

01:09:05.432 --> 01:09:09.394
Followed by hot and cold flashes.

01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:12.981
Then violent sneezing.

01:09:17.862 --> 01:09:19.404
Watch it, boy.

01:09:20.613 --> 01:09:21.781
You, you, you...

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:24.158
You sneaky old scoundrel!

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:35.170
It's not too serious, Madam.
You should recover in a few weeks

01:09:35.254 --> 01:09:39.131
and be as good...
I mean, as bad, as ever.

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:41.466
But I would suggest plenty of rest

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:45.555
and lots and lots of sunshine.

01:09:46.307 --> 01:09:48.515
I hate sunshine.

01:09:48.559 --> 01:09:52.729
I hate horrible, wholesome sunshine!

01:09:52.813 --> 01:09:54.522
I hate it, I hate it!

01:09:54.565 --> 01:09:57.150
I hate, hate, hate...

01:09:57.568 --> 01:10:01.529
You were really great, Merlin.
But you could have been killed.

01:10:01.572 --> 01:10:04.782
It was worth it, lad,
if you learned something from it.

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:08.286
Knowledge and wisdom
is the real power.

01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:11.998
Right you are, Wart.
So, stick to your schooling, boy.

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:14.709
Don't worry. I will, sir. I will.

01:10:14.752 --> 01:10:16.127
I really will.

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:21.674
We will sing
all night and all day

01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:27.013
We will fight for the blue oak tree
On a field of white

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:29.057
For the blue oak tree

01:10:29.141 --> 01:10:34.562
On a field of white

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:44.280
Here's to victory in London
for my son, Kay.

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:47.700
Sir Kay. I've been knighted, don't forget.

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:51.371
Of course, son, of course.

01:10:51.413 --> 01:10:53.206
Here's to Sir Kay.

01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:57.085
And who knows?
The future king of all England.

01:10:57.670 --> 01:10:59.337
Watch it, will ya?

01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:01.214
Kay the king?

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:03.758
What a dreadful thought.

01:11:03.842 --> 01:11:08.179
Sir Ector, Sir Ector,
Hobbs has come down with the mumps.

01:11:08.681 --> 01:11:12.433
He's all puffed up like a toad.

01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:15.645
Then Kay will need another squire,
hang it all.

01:11:15.729 --> 01:11:18.690
- Wart, you're it.
- I'm what, sir?

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:21.442
Kay's squire. You're going to London.

01:11:21.485 --> 01:11:24.195
Sir Ector! Wha... Wait. Whoa!

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:30.201
Merlin, Archimedes, Merlin!

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:35.164
Merlin, look! I'm a squire.

01:11:40.796 --> 01:11:42.880
Very nice, boy.

01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:44.799
Yes, indeed.

01:11:44.842 --> 01:11:48.886
A fine monkey suit for polishing boots.

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:51.347
It's what all squires wear.

01:11:51.432 --> 01:11:54.434
And I thought you were going
to amount to something.

01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:56.602
I thought you had a few brains!

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.106
Great future.

01:12:01.233 --> 01:12:04.944
A stooge for that big lunk, Kay.

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:07.655
Congratulations, boy!

01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:10.241
What do you want me to be?

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:12.160
I'm nobody. You...

01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:15.663
You don't know a thing
about what's going on today.

01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:18.499
I'm lucky to be Kay's squire.

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:23.338
Of all the idiotic... I...

01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:25.298
Blow me to Bermuda!

01:12:33.307 --> 01:12:37.643
- Where did he go?
- To Bermuda, I suppose.

01:12:37.686 --> 01:12:40.772
- Where's that?
- An island way off somewhere

01:12:40.856 --> 01:12:44.776
- that hasn't been discovered yet.
- Will he ever come back?

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:47.612
Who knows? Who knows anything?

01:12:52.326 --> 01:12:55.453
For the crown of all England,

01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:57.872
let the tournament begin!

01:13:16.558 --> 01:13:20.103
Kay! Now, it's up to the swords.

01:13:20.187 --> 01:13:22.480
Swords? Swords?

01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:24.315
Oh, no!

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.901
- Kay.
- What? What?

01:13:27.861 --> 01:13:30.488
I... I forgot your sword.

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:33.032
Forgot my sword!

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:36.035
I... I left it back at the inn.

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:39.747
Why, you bungling little fool!

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:43.251
You'd better get it,
or don't you dare come back!

01:13:48.465 --> 01:13:50.258
Let me in, let me in!

01:13:51.051 --> 01:13:53.636
Somebody, please! Please let me in!

01:13:53.971 --> 01:13:56.889
It's no use, boy,
they've all gone to the tournament.

01:13:56.932 --> 01:14:00.768
What will I do?
Kay's got to have a sword.

01:14:01.061 --> 01:14:03.813
Look, boy. Look.
There in the churchyard.

01:14:03.897 --> 01:14:07.024
A sword. Archimedes. A sword!

01:14:09.111 --> 01:14:11.279
You're gonna have a time pulling it out.

01:14:12.656 --> 01:14:14.115
Watch it, boy.

01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:24.625
Better leave it alone.

01:14:24.668 --> 01:14:28.171
But Kay's got to have a sword.

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:32.800
Now, come on, quick.
Let's get out of here.

01:14:35.345 --> 01:14:38.306
You're up next, son. Better get ready.

01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:40.516
Kay, Kay, here's a sword.

01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:46.022
- This is not my sword.
- Hold on, Kay.

01:14:46.106 --> 01:14:47.523
Wait a minute.

01:14:47.608 --> 01:14:50.776
"Whoso pulleth out this sword..."

01:14:52.237 --> 01:14:54.489
It's the sword in the stone.

01:14:54.531 --> 01:14:57.950
The sword in the stone? It can't be.

01:14:57.993 --> 01:14:59.285
But look, it is.

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:02.830
- It's the marvelous sword.
- Hold everything.

01:15:02.915 --> 01:15:06.667
Someone's pulled the sword
from the stone!

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:09.670
Where did you get it, Wart?

01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:13.049
I pulled it out of an anvil
that was on a stone

01:15:13.133 --> 01:15:14.675
in, in a churchyard.

01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:20.723
The lad's a young Samson.

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:23.643
You're making a fool of us, boy.

01:15:23.685 --> 01:15:26.771
- Now, tell the truth.
- But I did, sir.

01:15:26.855 --> 01:15:30.107
Then come on. Prove it.
To the stone with you.

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:32.735
Yes, prove it.

01:15:32.819 --> 01:15:35.029
Come on! Prove it!

01:15:41.411 --> 01:15:45.373
All right, boy, let's have the miracle.

01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:52.213
Now, wait a minute.

01:15:52.256 --> 01:15:55.883
Anyone can pull it once it's been pulled.

01:15:57.844 --> 01:16:01.055
Go to it, Kay. Give it all you've got.

01:16:01.515 --> 01:16:04.100
Put your back into it.

01:16:04.768 --> 01:16:07.019
- Get out.
- Push him aside.

01:16:08.689 --> 01:16:12.733
- Hold on. That's not fair.
- I say we let the boy try it.

01:16:12.776 --> 01:16:16.070
That's what I say.
Give the boy a chance.

01:16:16.154 --> 01:16:17.905
Go ahead, son.

01:16:30.794 --> 01:16:34.630
It's a miracle, ordained by heaven.

01:16:34.715 --> 01:16:37.091
This boy is our king.

01:16:37.175 --> 01:16:39.969
Well, by Jove.

01:16:40.053 --> 01:16:42.930
- What's the lad's name?
- Wart.

01:16:43.849 --> 01:16:45.266
I mean, Arthur.

01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:47.226
Hail, King Arthur!

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:51.105
Hail, King Arthur! Long live the King!

01:16:52.399 --> 01:16:54.609
I can't believe it.

01:16:55.736 --> 01:16:57.820
Forgive me, son.

01:16:58.530 --> 01:17:01.741
- Forgive me.
- Please don't, sir.

01:17:01.783 --> 01:17:04.744
Kay, bow down to your king.

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:14.462
So, at last,
the miracle had come to pass

01:17:14.504 --> 01:17:17.632
in that far-off time
upon New Year's Day.

01:17:17.716 --> 01:17:22.053
And the glorious reign
of King Arthur was begun.

01:17:25.474 --> 01:17:27.475
I can't be a king, Archimedes.

01:17:27.559 --> 01:17:30.144
I don't know anything
about ruling a country.

01:17:30.228 --> 01:17:34.106
I told you to leave the thing
in the stone, boy.

01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:37.151
I'll run away, that's what I'll do.

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:43.699
- They'll have to get somebody else.
- Better take the side door.

01:17:43.784 --> 01:17:45.534
Out the side door.

01:17:49.414 --> 01:17:52.833
Hail, King Arthur! Long live the king!

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:58.381
There's another door over there.
Over there, come on. Come on.

01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:04.136
Long live King Arthur!

01:18:04.179 --> 01:18:06.013
Long live...

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:09.684
Looks like we're surrounded, boy.

01:18:10.894 --> 01:18:13.104
Archimedes, I wish Merlin was here.

01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:18.609
Merlin! Merlin!

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:25.324
Merlin, you're back from Ber... Ber...

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:27.660
Bermuda? Yes.

01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:31.288
Back from Bermuda
and the 20th century.

01:18:32.207 --> 01:18:35.668
And believe me, you can have it.

01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:38.546
One big modern mess.

01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:40.589
Alakazam.

01:18:40.674 --> 01:18:45.302
- I'm in an awful pickle. I'm king.
- He pulled the sword from the stone.

01:18:46.930 --> 01:18:48.889
Of course, of course.

01:18:48.932 --> 01:18:52.935
King Arthur
and his Knights of the Round Table.

01:18:53.311 --> 01:18:56.856
- "Round Table"?
- Would you rather have a square one?

01:18:56.898 --> 01:18:59.150
Oh, no. Round will be fine.

01:19:00.819 --> 01:19:02.903
Boy, boy, boy.

01:19:02.946 --> 01:19:05.114
You'll become a great legend.

01:19:05.198 --> 01:19:09.410
They'll be writing books about you
for centuries to come.

01:19:09.494 --> 01:19:12.246
Why, they might even make
a motion picture about you.

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:15.249
Motion picture?

01:19:17.335 --> 01:19:20.212
Well, that's something like television.

01:19:21.465 --> 01:19:23.299
Without commercials.

01:19:26.386 --> 01:19:29.847
Hail, King Arthur
Long live the king
