WEBVTT

00:16.558 --> 00:18.769
<i>The morning after Chad and Julia's party,</i>

00:19.353 --> 00:21.021
<i>my mind was still spinning.</i>

00:21.021 --> 00:24.399
<i>Memo had almost been fired
for my leaks to</i> Espectacular.

00:24.983 --> 00:29.154
<i>I'd saved him, but only by letting Chad
believe that Héctor was actually the mole.</i>

00:29.821 --> 00:34.535
<i>Meanwhile, Julia and I finally admitted
that we had feelings for each other.</i>

00:34.535 --> 00:37.913
<i>But she was engaged,
and I was dating Isabel.</i>

00:38.580 --> 00:40.082
<i>There was nothing we could do.</i>

00:40.958 --> 00:42.501
You told us all this already.

00:42.501 --> 00:43.710
Memito!

00:43.710 --> 00:46.046
I am sorry. He's so rude.

00:46.630 --> 00:49.341
Hugo, have you heard the expression...

00:51.009 --> 00:51.927
No.

00:51.927 --> 00:55.639
It means,
"Like Acapulco during Holy Week."

00:57.432 --> 01:02.020
<i>See, Easter Week is the busiest
week of the year for resorts in Acapulco.</i>

01:02.020 --> 01:03.397
<i>The city's packed.</i>

01:03.397 --> 01:09.319
<i>But in 1985, Good Friday at Las Colinas
looked a little bit different.</i>

01:17.119 --> 01:19.496
Everyone, please, gather round.

01:20.664 --> 01:22.291
That's right. Come closer.

01:22.291 --> 01:24.293
Thank you. That's right.

01:25.002 --> 01:26.003
Little closer.

01:26.587 --> 01:30.465
As you all know,
we only have one guest today.

01:30.465 --> 01:34.011
Our hotel's newest investor, Ricardo Vera.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.431
He's rented out
the entire resort for his entourage,

01:37.431 --> 01:41.393
so as you may gather,
he is extremely private.

01:41.393 --> 01:43.103
And extremely rich!

01:43.103 --> 01:45.439
I'd like to show <i>him</i> something

01:45.439 --> 01:47.357
extremely private.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.197
Isn't that the truth?

01:54.573 --> 01:57.576
This visit is incredibly important
for the resort,

01:57.576 --> 02:00.287
so only a few of us
will be dealing directly with him.

02:00.287 --> 02:04.708
The rest of you stand by
in case we need you. I wanna make sure...

02:04.708 --> 02:07.211
I can't believe
Héctor turned out to be the mole.

02:07.211 --> 02:09.463
That jerk deserves whatever he gets.

02:10.631 --> 02:14.176
Except a hornet sting.
I don't wish that on anybody.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.387
Any questions?

02:17.888 --> 02:19.598
So, if there aren't any guests,

02:19.598 --> 02:21.308
what are we supposed to do all day?

02:21.308 --> 02:25.437
As long as you steer clear of Mr. Vera,
I don't care what you do.

02:25.437 --> 02:26.813
No nude sunbathing.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.567
Okay. Thank you, everyone.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.987
Máximo, come see me in my office.

02:38.992 --> 02:42.120
I want you to be the one
taking care of Mr. Vera today.

02:42.120 --> 02:45.874
Wow, of course. Mr. Vera
is everything I aspire to be one day.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.085
Thank you.
I can't believe I was your top choice.

02:48.085 --> 02:49.169
You were.

02:49.169 --> 02:53.006
Since Don Pablo left, Héctor went rogue
and Chad is too distracted by his wedding.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.633
I can't believe I was your fourth choice.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.468
You know how I'm always saying crap like,

02:56.468 --> 02:58.804
"this is our most important guest,
blah, blah, blah"?

02:58.804 --> 03:00.430
Every other time was a lie.

03:00.430 --> 03:03.058
This is our most important guest ever.

03:03.058 --> 03:05.811
Do whatever you have to do
to keep him in a good mood.

03:05.811 --> 03:08.939
I need to ask for a stupid amount of
extra money at my dinner with him tonight.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.065
I won't disappoint you.

03:10.065 --> 03:14.570
That is exactly the kind of attitude
I expect from my new head pool boy.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.281
Oh, my God. Are you serious?

03:17.281 --> 03:21.076
You've earned it.
The job is yours once I fire Héctor.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.788
Oh, is that happening soon?

03:24.788 --> 03:27.165
Later.
He's a bit of a loose cannon right now

03:27.165 --> 03:29.626
and I need to wait
till we're done with Mr. Vera.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.753
And then, he's going to be...

03:33.088 --> 03:35.716
"Héctor the Unemployment Collector."

03:47.853 --> 03:49.104
Hi, my love.

03:49.104 --> 03:52.232
Sorry to bother you on Holy Week;

03:52.232 --> 03:55.360
things must be crazy up there.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.404
But... it's about Sara.

03:58.405 --> 04:00.741
I've been really struggling lately.

04:00.741 --> 04:04.745
I miss her and I want her back home...

04:04.745 --> 04:09.082
but I can't just ignore what she's done.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.001
Can I?

04:11.668 --> 04:12.961
So, I don't know...

04:12.961 --> 04:14.963
...if you run into Jesus,

04:15.297 --> 04:18.675
could you ask him to
send me a sign or something?

04:18.675 --> 04:20.177
Thanks.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.231
<i>Hold on a second.</i>

04:32.231 --> 04:34.983
You're telling me Jesus visited <i>Abuela</i>?

04:34.983 --> 04:38.487
It wasn't Jesus Jesus.
It was Chucho, Roberta's dad.

04:38.487 --> 04:41.615
And he was dressed that way
because he was playing Jesus

04:41.615 --> 04:44.618
in our church's reenactment
of the crucifixion.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.954
It's a Good Friday tradition.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.039
Lots of people participate.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.250
It's basically a Catholic Comic-Con.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.334
No, Memito.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.670
It's not a Catholic Comic-Con.

04:54.670 --> 04:56.296
I'm sorry.
-It's okay, it's okay.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.298
I don't know what to do about this kid.
-Yeah.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.634
Oh my God, Chucho. Everything ok?

05:00.634 --> 05:02.886
No, everything's bad.

05:02.886 --> 05:05.305
Starting with your sicko,
devil-child daughter!

05:06.849 --> 05:11.103
She's been trying to trick my innocent
Roberta into doing ungodly things.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.480
Things that go against the Bible.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.816
I assume,
I don't read the Bible too often.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.192
It's so boring.

05:17.901 --> 05:20.571
But I don't need to, because I already
look like Jesus.

05:20.571 --> 05:23.949
But you are a horrible mother.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.034
Now, if you'll excuse me,

05:26.034 --> 05:28.620
that cross isn't gonna carry itself.

05:37.963 --> 05:40.591
<i>That same morning,
before Ricardo showed up,</i>

05:40.591 --> 05:43.135
<i>the staff got to enjoy the empty resort.</i>

06:10.954 --> 06:11.997
Máximo, Máximo.

06:12.497 --> 06:13.916
Something terrible has happened!

06:13.916 --> 06:14.875
What's going on?

06:14.875 --> 06:16.418
Look! I just realized...

06:16.418 --> 06:18.462
...Héctor can't be the mole!

06:18.879 --> 06:22.257
Chad said Fabián got the information
between six and seven.

06:22.257 --> 06:25.969
<i>But that whole time, I could see Héctor
from the V.I.P. area.</i>

06:25.969 --> 06:27.554
<i>He didn't go anywhere.</i>

06:27.554 --> 06:30.974
We can't let the wrong guy take the fall.

06:31.642 --> 06:34.228
I still have nightmares
from when I was five

06:34.228 --> 06:37.731
and I told my mom it was the dog
who wet my bed.

06:37.731 --> 06:38.690
We have to tell Chad.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.025
Well, okay, hold on a second.

06:40.025 --> 06:43.695
I mean, Héctor might not have done
this thing, but doesn't he deserve

06:43.695 --> 06:45.280
to get fired for other things?

06:45.781 --> 06:48.033
Oh, my-- Héctor! Héctor!

06:48.033 --> 06:51.245
And with him gone, it'd just be you
and me living our dream, right...?

06:52.287 --> 06:54.873
That does sound nice...

06:55.624 --> 06:58.544
But no. It's not right.

06:58.544 --> 07:01.463
Plus, we have to find the real mole!

07:01.463 --> 07:03.131
Or maybe we don't!

07:03.131 --> 07:07.928
Máximo, what do you mean?! Someone out
there is betraying Las Colinas--

07:07.928 --> 07:08.887
Memo!

07:10.597 --> 07:12.099
I'm the mole.

07:14.476 --> 07:17.229
You worked with Espectacular?

07:17.229 --> 07:19.773
I didn't mean to get roped in, but
I was desperate for money--

07:19.773 --> 07:21.400
Máximo, I almost got fired!

07:21.400 --> 07:23.360
But you didn't! I would never have
let that happen.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.237
But you'll let Héctor get fired--

07:25.237 --> 07:28.532
and then you become
head pool boy of Las Colinas?

07:29.491 --> 07:31.451
This is not some moral gray area.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.872
You need to do the right thing.
-Hey, hey!

07:35.831 --> 07:37.624
Ricardo Vera is here!

07:37.624 --> 07:39.626
He's taller than I expected!

07:39.626 --> 07:41.712
Let's get out of the pool area!

07:44.548 --> 07:46.884
Do you think men like Ricardo Vera
got ahead by always doing

07:46.884 --> 07:49.052
"the right thing"?

07:50.095 --> 07:51.638
I don't know who you are.

07:51.638 --> 07:54.808
But you are not Máximo Gallardo.

07:58.812 --> 08:02.983
Our biggest fight ever.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.152
Most boring story ever.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.320
Memito!

08:06.320 --> 08:07.529
I'm sorry.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.531
I'm gonna take away your phone.

08:38.936 --> 08:41.938
Mr. Vera, welcome to Las Colinas.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.065
Thank you, Diane.

08:43.065 --> 08:47.945
This is my son, Chad, his fiancé, Julia,
and this is Máximo.

08:47.945 --> 08:51.490
He'll be taking
"Vera" good care of you today.

08:52.991 --> 08:55.202
Vera. Vera?

08:58.413 --> 09:02.084
First "unemployment collector," now that.
You are not writing jokes for me anymore.

09:02.084 --> 09:03.794
Well, you're butchering the delivery.

09:03.794 --> 09:05.420
What do you know about delivery?

09:07.297 --> 09:08.632
Kelli.

09:09.842 --> 09:11.927
All the guests
are supposed to be checked out by now.

09:11.927 --> 09:13.637
What are you still doing here?

09:13.637 --> 09:16.098
I am so hungover.
Hey, what happened last night?

09:16.098 --> 09:17.558
Nothing. Nothing happened.

09:17.558 --> 09:19.726
You had a great time,
and you still love your husband.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.688
Your cab's here.
You can settle the check by mail or don't.

09:22.688 --> 09:24.022
Okay.
-Just get out of here.

09:24.022 --> 09:26.900
Okay. Well,
congrats again, my cosmic sister.

09:27.484 --> 09:30.362
I knew when Diane asked me
to come down here, the universe--

09:32.406 --> 09:33.490
I'm so happy for you.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.534
Okay, I'll see you soon.

09:45.419 --> 09:48.755
I just saw the funniest chicken
on my way here--

09:48.755 --> 09:49.923
What's wrong?

09:52.384 --> 09:54.094
Am I a horrible mother?

09:54.094 --> 09:55.929
What?

09:55.929 --> 09:58.515
Of course not. Why?

10:02.269 --> 10:05.689
Roberta's dad came by and
said that Sara was a...

10:05.689 --> 10:07.441
Sara is a...

10:07.441 --> 10:08.692
a sicko!

10:09.401 --> 10:12.154
Sara's no sicko. Trust me.

10:12.154 --> 10:14.031
I work at the Bus Depot.

10:14.323 --> 10:16.783
I don't know what to believe anymore.

10:16.783 --> 10:17.868
Nora.

10:18.660 --> 10:21.079
You know your daughter.

10:21.079 --> 10:27.419
You've raised a kind, strong,
wonderful young woman.

10:28.045 --> 10:31.048
Besides,
I'll always be grateful to her because...

10:33.258 --> 10:34.635
Well, if it weren't for her

10:34.635 --> 10:36.637
we wouldn't even be together.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.432
What do you mean?

10:41.183 --> 10:45.020
Why do you think things were
always breaking in here?

10:45.020 --> 10:48.482
She knew we were meant for each other

10:48.482 --> 10:51.276
before we did.

10:52.611 --> 10:58.867
How could someone with such a wonderful
heart be anything but wonderful herself?

10:59.743 --> 11:01.828
You're right.

11:02.454 --> 11:04.665
Sara is sweet...

11:05.749 --> 11:07.459
If anything...

11:07.459 --> 11:09.586
it's Roberta who's the devil-child!

11:09.837 --> 11:10.796
What? No...

11:10.796 --> 11:13.131
Yes. She's the one who corrupted my
precious little baby!

11:13.131 --> 11:15.050
Okay, that's not what I--

11:15.050 --> 11:16.176
Where are you going!?

11:16.176 --> 11:18.178
I'm going to find Jesus.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.221
No, wait!

11:19.221 --> 11:20.138
Don't go!

11:20.138 --> 11:21.390
Nora!

11:22.558 --> 11:25.018
Yeah, all good here... we're clear.

11:26.603 --> 11:31.149
<i>Meanwhile, my big assignment from Diane
to put Mr. Vera in a good mood</i>

11:31.149 --> 11:33.151
<i>was not going so well.</i>

11:39.575 --> 11:40.993
What do you think of the view, sir?

11:40.993 --> 11:43.453
Same ocean I see from all my resorts.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.330
Except your hotel in Cancún.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.457
That's the Atlantic.

11:48.375 --> 11:52.588
I'll have the seafood tower, please.

11:52.588 --> 11:54.548
Excellent choice.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.592
<i>How do you win over
someone who has everything</i>

11:56.592 --> 11:59.303
<i>and who spends every day
in a fancy resort?</i>

11:59.928 --> 12:03.348
<i>You don't upsell them, you down-sell them.</i>

12:03.348 --> 12:05.184
But if you're only here for one day,

12:05.184 --> 12:06.977
you have to have Acapulco ceviche--

12:06.977 --> 12:08.270
the best in the world.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.772
Seafood with ketchup? No, thank you.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.774
Aw, poor man...

12:13.400 --> 12:16.153
All that money,
yet you've never known true joy.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.948
There's a ceviche stand around the
corner that will change your life.

12:19.948 --> 12:22.284
I don't think
any ceviche will change my life.

12:22.284 --> 12:23.660
Okay, how about this:

12:23.660 --> 12:26.121
I'll take you there, and if that ceviche
doesn't change your life,

12:26.121 --> 12:27.873
then the meal's on me.

12:27.873 --> 12:30.167
But if it does...

12:30.167 --> 12:32.336
then I get half your company.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.380
Ambitious, but unlikely.

12:35.380 --> 12:39.468
Okay, then. You buy us a new
coffee maker for the employee area.

12:40.052 --> 12:40.886
Okay.

12:40.886 --> 12:43.430
I love a good bet.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.682
And that sounds delightful. Truly.

12:45.682 --> 12:48.393
But I don't think my team will allow it.

12:48.393 --> 12:49.895
Unfortunately,

12:49.895 --> 12:51.688
you can't just sneak around when

12:51.688 --> 12:53.857
you're one of the wealthiest men
in Mexico.

12:53.857 --> 12:58.195
Señor Vera, here at Las Colinas,
the guest gets what the guest wants.

13:02.824 --> 13:03.825
You lied to me.

13:03.825 --> 13:08.038
And trust me,
I am so, so sorry I had to do that.

13:08.664 --> 13:10.082
Now, which lie are you talking about?

13:10.082 --> 13:12.501
You promised me you wouldn't interfere
in our wedding,

13:12.501 --> 13:14.503
but you invited Chad's ex-girlfriend here.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.298
Why?

13:19.132 --> 13:20.759
Do you hate me that much?

13:20.759 --> 13:23.345
No, Julia. I love you.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.057
That's why I've been trying to
help you and Chad see that

13:27.933 --> 13:30.060
you should not be getting married.

13:30.060 --> 13:31.478
Wow.

13:31.478 --> 13:34.565
I see where you're both headed,
and I don't want anyone to get hurt.

13:34.565 --> 13:38.443
Believe me, everything I did,
I did from love.

13:39.111 --> 13:40.112
Wait.

13:40.737 --> 13:41.738
Everything?

13:43.866 --> 13:45.450
<i>And then Diane explained that</i>

13:45.450 --> 13:48.620
<i>after talking with Julia and Chad
failed to change their minds,</i>

13:48.620 --> 13:50.789
<i>she decided to find other ways</i>

13:50.789 --> 13:53.959
<i>to help them realize
they shouldn't get married.</i>

13:53.959 --> 13:56.336
<i>First, she tried to delay the wedding.</i>

13:56.336 --> 13:59.006
Yes, I know you're deejaying that wedding.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.884
I'll pay you double
what they're paying to cancel on them.

14:03.594 --> 14:07.556
<i>But that didn't work
since Chad went ahead and learned salsa.</i>

14:09.224 --> 14:13.729
<i>Then Diane noticed
how well Julia and I got along.</i>

14:14.229 --> 14:15.397
Hang on.

14:15.397 --> 14:18.442
Why was Diane
always hiding behind some plant?

14:18.442 --> 14:20.527
I don't know.
That's just how I pictured it.

14:20.527 --> 14:24.156
Was it the same plant? Was she carrying
the plant from place to place?

14:24.156 --> 14:26.283
Hugo, please. You're interrupting.

14:26.283 --> 14:27.868
You know, I had the same question.

14:27.868 --> 14:30.329
It's taking me out of the story,
although I don't really care...

14:30.329 --> 14:31.622
Hey, everyone just--

14:32.122 --> 14:33.373
Fine!

14:33.373 --> 14:34.791
No more plants.

14:35.417 --> 14:40.297
The point is Diane was the one
who put us together on Valentine's Day,

14:40.297 --> 14:41.882
hoping something might happen.

14:41.882 --> 14:45.677
All right, you two.
Fill this suite up with romance.

14:45.677 --> 14:49.598
<i>But, as you know, it just made
Julia's relationship with Chad stronger.</i>

14:49.598 --> 14:51.642
So, when all that failed,

14:51.642 --> 14:54.269
you brought in Kelli so Chad
would fall back in love with her?

14:54.269 --> 14:59.149
No, I wanted you to see just how different
Chad was before he met you.

14:59.149 --> 15:01.193
Meditation, vegetarian.

15:01.777 --> 15:03.070
Do you really wanna be with someone

15:03.070 --> 15:06.281
who just changes who they are
depending on who they're with?

15:07.574 --> 15:09.743
Chad doesn't know who he is.

15:09.743 --> 15:13.664
He only proposed to you
because he had no idea what else to do.

15:14.498 --> 15:17.918
And you only said yes
because you were too scared to say no.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.045
What?

15:20.045 --> 15:24.299
Julia, my darling,
you need to go after what you want.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.593
And he needs to figure out what he wants.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.887
And right now,
you're both holding each other back.

15:28.887 --> 15:32.641
I can't believe you did all of that.
That was-- That was way over the line.

15:33.225 --> 15:35.978
No, no. Remember,
I said it all comes from love.

15:35.978 --> 15:37.729
That's why it's forgivable.

15:39.898 --> 15:45.028
<i>Around that time, I had figured out a way
to sneak Ricardo out of the resort.</i>

15:45.028 --> 15:47.614
<i>But, I needed Lupe's help.</i>

15:48.198 --> 15:49.408
Lupe.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.869
All in.

15:51.869 --> 15:53.871
Can I borrow an extra pool boy uniform?

15:53.871 --> 15:56.081
What's in it for me?

15:58.458 --> 16:00.335
Please, I have nothing.

16:00.335 --> 16:04.590
I just need ONE SMALL PAIR of pants.

16:10.220 --> 16:11.054
Call.

16:12.848 --> 16:15.058
Oh, man, there goes the
money for my kid's braces.

16:16.351 --> 16:18.145
I'll get you the uniform.

16:21.732 --> 16:23.275
Are you doing anything right now?

16:23.275 --> 16:26.778
Not calling my ex-wife, that's for sure.

16:26.987 --> 16:29.198
Look Marco, no excuses.

16:29.198 --> 16:31.742
I'm going to report this to our manager.

16:31.742 --> 16:33.577
No more starch in the towels

16:33.577 --> 16:34.578
...well just a little but...

16:34.578 --> 16:36.038
And you don't pay attention to me.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.339
I'm loving this!

16:45.339 --> 16:48.091
Do you think my people will
buy that three-hour massage thing?

16:48.091 --> 16:50.552
Don't worry. I got it covered.

16:53.639 --> 16:55.933
Everything all right, boss?

17:02.940 --> 17:05.400
This is the most fun I've had

17:05.400 --> 17:09.863
since John Cusack took me tandem-biking.

17:10.155 --> 17:11.156
Three...

17:11.156 --> 17:12.741
Two... One...

17:31.009 --> 17:34.012
I'm glad you're happy.

17:34.012 --> 17:36.598
Especially today.

17:36.598 --> 17:37.766
Thanks?

17:37.766 --> 17:40.060
Is there anything else you
want to do today?

17:40.060 --> 17:42.104
Like, if this were your last day here--

17:42.104 --> 17:44.690
what would you want to do
to make it special?

17:44.690 --> 17:46.984
Just say the word.

17:47.526 --> 17:48.986
Now that you mention it, dude...

17:48.986 --> 17:51.446
I've always wanted to jump into that pool...

17:51.446 --> 17:53.532
from thaaaaaaaat

17:53.532 --> 17:55.158
balcony.

17:55.993 --> 17:57.202
Héctor...

17:57.202 --> 17:59.663
today, you will make that leap.

17:59.663 --> 18:02.583
Yeah. So the whole time,
she's just been trying to break us up.

18:02.583 --> 18:03.834
Can't believe my mom did that.

18:03.834 --> 18:05.586
Who am I kidding?
Of course I can. It's my mom.

18:05.586 --> 18:08.046
Oh, no.
She said we're holding each other back.

18:08.046 --> 18:10.174
She said you need to figure out
who you want to be in life.

18:10.174 --> 18:13.135
That is crazy.
-I know, she obviously has something--

18:13.135 --> 18:15.095
'Cause I was just thinking the same thing.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.265
What?

18:19.183 --> 18:20.309
Since when?

18:21.894 --> 18:24.188
It started
when I was salsa dancing with Don Pablo.

18:26.148 --> 18:31.153
I realized that my whole life
I've just done what I was told to do.

18:31.945 --> 18:34.114
So, then I wondered, you know,

18:34.114 --> 18:35.699
what do I want to do?

18:35.699 --> 18:36.783
And...

18:37.701 --> 18:41.538
then, you know, I thought, "Hey, you know,
why can't you just be Julia's husband?"

18:42.122 --> 18:45.250
Julia's husband. That's got
a cool double "H" sound, you know?

18:46.335 --> 18:48.253
Why would I wanna be anything more?

18:51.673 --> 18:52.674
So...

18:54.176 --> 18:55.469
I am holding you back.

19:19.743 --> 19:21.411
Get away from him!

19:22.371 --> 19:24.039
Get up!

19:30.963 --> 19:32.297
Who do you think you are?!

19:34.174 --> 19:35.884
Uh... Jesus?

19:35.884 --> 19:38.178
You're not like Jesus at all.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.596
It's your daughter who corrupted mine!

19:39.596 --> 19:42.349
You're the one who's a terrible parent.

19:44.601 --> 19:46.144
Who are you gonna believe--

19:46.144 --> 19:47.396
Her?

19:47.396 --> 19:49.731
Or a guy that looks like Jesus?

19:49.940 --> 19:54.111
Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!

19:54.111 --> 19:55.696
Hit him! Hit him!

19:56.530 --> 20:02.327
Hey! Come back here!
What are you afraid of?

20:02.327 --> 20:05.247
Even if I kill him,
he'll be back in three days.

20:05.622 --> 20:07.374
Hypocrite!

20:07.374 --> 20:09.168
Sacrilegious!

20:09.626 --> 20:10.627
Thanks!

20:10.627 --> 20:12.337
If you were really like Jesus,

20:12.337 --> 20:14.089
you would turn the other cheek!

20:14.089 --> 20:15.215
Such a hypocrite!

20:16.175 --> 20:18.844
Wow, that Good Friday procession
can get pretty emotional.

20:18.844 --> 20:20.137
Yeah.

20:25.475 --> 20:27.769
Okay, wow.

20:27.769 --> 20:28.937
Did it change your life?

20:28.937 --> 20:30.856
It brought me back to life!
But the best part...

20:30.856 --> 20:32.232
is this.

20:32.232 --> 20:34.026
Eating on the street,

20:34.026 --> 20:36.111
drinking out of a bag...

20:36.778 --> 20:38.697
It's nice to feel normal again.

20:39.364 --> 20:40.490
How I missed this...

20:44.536 --> 20:45.871
I missed that, too.

20:46.496 --> 20:47.623
Gives it flavor.

20:50.626 --> 20:54.296
But isn't who we are something,
I don't know, we can figure out together?

20:54.796 --> 20:56.798
Yeah, yeah, that's a--
That's a good point.

20:56.798 --> 20:59.927
I mean, because you don't know everything
you wanna do in life, either, do you?

21:00.511 --> 21:01.929
No, not at all.

21:01.929 --> 21:05.516
I mean, I definitely wanna live in Paris
and Milan. And New York after that.

21:05.516 --> 21:07.392
Definitely wanna expand my clothing line.

21:07.392 --> 21:10.771
I wanna go back to Medellín and found
an internship program for young women.

21:10.771 --> 21:13.857
And I wanna go to a water slide park.
I've never been to one.

21:14.942 --> 21:17.653
See? We're both directionless.

21:32.668 --> 21:35.712
Look,
the thing that I can't get past though,

21:36.296 --> 21:38.298
is if we don't know who I am,

21:39.967 --> 21:42.261
then how do you know
that I'm right for you?

21:44.179 --> 21:45.264
I mean, can I ask?

21:47.224 --> 21:48.767
Am I holding you back?

21:51.937 --> 21:53.939
Like, are there things
that you wanna do in life?

21:53.939 --> 21:56.942
Or paths that you might be taking
that you're not taking

21:57.734 --> 21:58.986
because you're with me?

22:05.284 --> 22:06.285
Hey, look...

22:10.622 --> 22:12.666
I don't want you to give up you for me.

22:17.129 --> 22:18.839
Can I ask you something?

22:18.839 --> 22:19.965
Yes.

22:19.965 --> 22:24.011
To get to the top, you must have
had to be pretty ruthless, right?

22:25.345 --> 22:28.849
Well... I learned, at the end of
the day, all you have is yourself.

22:28.849 --> 22:31.393
Right!
You have to look out for number one.

22:31.393 --> 22:34.021
No, I actually mean the opposite.

22:35.606 --> 22:38.859
I did everything I could to get ahead.

22:38.859 --> 22:42.613
And now I sit alone in my jet,

22:42.613 --> 22:44.823
or in one of my hotels,

22:44.823 --> 22:46.742
and I wonder...

22:47.993 --> 22:51.788
What if I'd spent more time making allies

22:51.788 --> 22:53.081
instead of enemies?

22:55.125 --> 22:58.170
What would life be like for me now?

22:59.671 --> 23:02.883
So that's what I mean. Whatever you do,

23:02.883 --> 23:05.761
make sure you can live with it.

23:05.761 --> 23:07.971
Because, at the end of the day,

23:07.971 --> 23:09.765
all you have is yourself.

23:11.850 --> 23:13.685
<i>That's when I realized,</i>

23:13.685 --> 23:15.896
<i>I couldn't let Héctor take the blame.</i>

23:15.896 --> 23:17.648
<i>I had to do the right thing.</i>

23:18.148 --> 23:20.317
You know what would be
really good with this ice-cream?

23:20.859 --> 23:22.611
Pork rinds.

23:25.656 --> 23:27.032
Oh, sure.

23:27.032 --> 23:29.034
When your best friend says it,
you don't do it.

23:29.034 --> 23:31.328
But when the rich guy says it. Yes, sir.

23:31.328 --> 23:34.790
Are you still upset about this?
It was decades ago.

23:34.790 --> 23:36.792
Yeah, but have you learned your lesson?

23:37.376 --> 23:39.503
I'm still telling you
to do the right thing.

23:39.503 --> 23:41.213
And you're still not listening to me.

23:41.797 --> 23:43.549
Do the right thing.

23:44.091 --> 23:45.259
Go see her.

23:45.259 --> 23:48.637
Hold on,
is "her" the "her" from the itinerary?

23:48.637 --> 23:50.889
Who is it? Julia or Isabel?

23:50.889 --> 23:52.808
"Her" is nobody. Be quiet.

23:53.517 --> 23:56.728
Last time, she didn't exactly
greet me with open arms.

23:57.437 --> 23:59.314
How do you even know she would see me?

23:59.898 --> 24:01.400
Because I've spoken with her.

24:03.443 --> 24:04.903
Kitchen, now.

24:12.619 --> 24:16.123
Man, you must get so bored
of hearing my uncle's stories.

24:16.123 --> 24:18.041
For what he pays me, I'll never get bored.

24:19.168 --> 24:22.212
Of course, his stories are nothing
compared to my own.

24:22.212 --> 24:23.297
Really?

24:24.464 --> 24:28.218
I'd love to hear it sometime--
-It all started in Portland, 1996.

24:28.802 --> 24:32.472
Today's the day I finally quit my job,
win back the girl of my dreams

24:32.472 --> 24:34.224
and stick it to the man!

24:36.810 --> 24:38.645
Sorry, guys. I'm back.

24:42.441 --> 24:44.860
So what did you guys--
-Where was I?

24:44.860 --> 24:46.111
Oh, that's right.

24:46.653 --> 24:49.489
I snuck Ricardo back into Las Colinas.

24:56.538 --> 24:58.165
Máximo, thanks so much.

24:58.165 --> 25:00.167
That ceviche? Yes, it changed my life.

25:00.167 --> 25:02.669
You earned that coffee machine
for your colleagues.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.338
Well, If you had a great time,

25:04.338 --> 25:07.424
then maybe you'll throw in
a Jacuzzi for the employees--

25:07.424 --> 25:09.843
Ambitious, but unlikely.

25:09.843 --> 25:11.345
Here...

25:11.345 --> 25:13.764
Give me a call sometime.

25:14.389 --> 25:15.641
Thanks.

25:16.266 --> 25:20.812
<i>As you may imagine, that's not
the last we'll hear about Ricardo Vera.</i>

25:33.742 --> 25:36.036
That is a funny-looking chicken.

25:37.371 --> 25:38.455
Virgin Mary.

25:38.872 --> 25:39.706
Hey!

25:40.040 --> 25:41.708
You're the one who told Chucho off!

25:41.708 --> 25:43.836
I can't believe I screamed at Jesus.

25:43.836 --> 25:47.631
Don't worry about it.
That guy is such a jerk.

25:47.631 --> 25:50.175
It's the first time
I ever rooted for Judas.

25:50.175 --> 25:53.846
And if he thinks that cross is heavy,

25:53.846 --> 25:55.472
he should try carrying this.

25:56.390 --> 26:00.561
Right? How could they let such a
knucklehead play Jesus?

26:01.311 --> 26:05.023
Life's full of contradiction.

26:05.023 --> 26:06.567
For instance...

26:06.567 --> 26:08.360
I'm not really a virgin.

26:09.987 --> 26:11.113
I get it.

26:13.240 --> 26:15.450
I'm full of contradictions myself.

26:15.450 --> 26:17.035
Really? How so?

26:22.833 --> 26:26.170
I've always tried to be a good Catholic.

26:26.170 --> 26:31.675
But lately, it's harder than ever
for me to tell right from wrong.

26:32.467 --> 26:33.552
What do you do when

26:33.552 --> 26:36.346
you have to choose between what
the church tells you,

26:36.346 --> 26:38.599
and how you feel?

26:38.599 --> 26:41.643
Well, I don't really know--

26:41.643 --> 26:45.647
The rest of the year, I work at an
underground casino...

26:46.815 --> 26:50.235
But it seems to me that being a
good Catholic

26:50.235 --> 26:52.988
is about love,

26:52.988 --> 26:54.740
kindness, and forgiveness.

26:55.282 --> 26:56.992
Beyond that...

26:56.992 --> 26:59.036
who knows?

26:59.036 --> 27:01.830
So maybe the answer is to just...

27:02.748 --> 27:05.459
live with the contradiction.

27:10.923 --> 27:13.550
Is it weird
that I feel kind of good about this?

27:13.550 --> 27:15.719
No. Maybe it means we did the right thing.

27:16.845 --> 27:19.681
Yeah. Maybe.
-Yeah.

27:22.809 --> 27:24.269
I'm glad we didn't jump.

27:24.269 --> 27:25.771
Me too.

27:25.771 --> 27:27.648
But not because it was scary.

27:27.648 --> 27:29.983
No! It wasn't scary at all.

27:29.983 --> 27:32.319
It just seemed very boring...

27:32.319 --> 27:34.238
...it didn't seem fun.

27:34.238 --> 27:35.989
It would be boring.

27:35.989 --> 27:38.242
Very, VERY boring!

27:38.700 --> 27:40.911
Who wants to jump off a
balcony and be bored?

27:40.911 --> 27:42.037
No, I don't want to be bored!

27:42.037 --> 27:43.413
Me either.
-Why be bored?

27:43.413 --> 27:44.414
For what?

27:44.414 --> 27:45.958
Life is not about that.
-No.

27:53.173 --> 27:55.217
If it isn't the man of the hour.

27:55.217 --> 27:59.137
Mr. Vera just raved to me
about how wonderful you were today.

27:59.930 --> 28:01.807
I can't tell you how grateful I am.

28:02.558 --> 28:03.767
About that--

28:03.767 --> 28:05.477
There's something I need to tell you.

28:06.770 --> 28:08.939
Héctor's not the one
who talked to <i>Espectacular</i>.

28:09.439 --> 28:10.440
It was me.

28:11.024 --> 28:12.276
I'm the mole.

28:14.486 --> 28:16.321
I could explain to you
the reasons I did it,

28:16.321 --> 28:19.199
but I know that won't change
what has to happen next.

28:20.075 --> 28:21.410
Just please understand,

28:21.410 --> 28:24.705
I never did anything that I thought
would hurt you or the resort.

28:26.623 --> 28:28.375
But I did betray your trust.

28:28.876 --> 28:32.796
And for that, I am incredibly sorry,
Ms. Davies.

28:36.425 --> 28:37.634
I'm sorry too.

28:41.096 --> 28:42.598
Get your things, Máximo.

28:44.016 --> 28:45.475
You're fired.

29:09.583 --> 29:11.126
Hey. Everything good, hermigo?

29:11.126 --> 29:12.961
Yes, now it is.

29:18.550 --> 29:20.844
Can't a gal get two minutes around here?

29:21.762 --> 29:23.055
Julia and I broke up.

29:24.973 --> 29:29.728
You were right. I have no idea who I am,
and that's not fair to her.

29:31.355 --> 29:32.689
I'm so proud of you.

29:33.315 --> 29:37.444
I'm sure it wasn't easy, but I know
it's for the best for both of you.

29:37.444 --> 29:39.821
But we also talked about why I'm this way.

29:40.322 --> 29:44.618
And I realized it's because you try to
control every aspect of my life.

29:44.618 --> 29:48.330
And all the stuff
you just told Julia today proves that.

29:48.914 --> 29:51.834
I've had to control you
because you've never chosen a direction.

29:51.834 --> 29:55.754
No. I've never chosen a direction
because you've always controlled me.

29:55.754 --> 29:58.006
And the only way
I'm ever gonna figure out my life

29:58.006 --> 29:59.925
is by going away for a while.

29:59.925 --> 30:01.218
What do you mean by that?

30:01.885 --> 30:04.012
I'm going to LA. Okay?

30:04.012 --> 30:06.557
For a few months, at least.

30:06.557 --> 30:07.808
Maybe longer.

30:09.977 --> 30:12.312
Consider this my letter of resignation.

30:14.606 --> 30:16.608
The top half
is lyrics to a Whitesnake song.

30:16.608 --> 30:18.694
I couldn't find a clean piece of paper.

30:18.694 --> 30:19.987
But you're my...

30:23.240 --> 30:24.575
you're my Chad.

30:25.075 --> 30:27.744
I'm sorry, Mom. I'm leaving next week.

30:30.414 --> 30:32.457
They're dropping like flies around here.

30:39.381 --> 30:42.050
<i>How far will we go for what we want?</i>

30:42.551 --> 30:44.094
<i>Diane thought there was no limit</i>

30:44.094 --> 30:47.806
<i>but ended up losing
the thing she cared about the most...</i>

30:54.730 --> 30:56.982
They're just...

30:57.774 --> 30:59.443
sweet.

31:01.069 --> 31:04.406
They're like the letters
I used to write as a teen.

31:04.406 --> 31:06.491
<i>My mom was still wrestling with how far</i>

31:06.491 --> 31:09.536
<i>she was willing to go away from
all she had been taught</i>

31:09.536 --> 31:11.830
<i>in order to welcome her daughter back.</i>

31:15.876 --> 31:20.464
<i>As for me, I'd found my limit,
the line I would not cross.</i>

31:20.464 --> 31:24.051
<i>I realized I had to live up
to the person I wanted to be.</i>

31:24.051 --> 31:26.553
<i>Even if it meant losing Las Colinas.</i>

31:26.553 --> 31:28.472
Are you okay?

31:29.097 --> 31:30.390
What happened?

31:32.976 --> 31:35.938
Does your job offer still stand?

31:37.940 --> 31:39.441
<i>I was sad.</i>

31:39.441 --> 31:42.945
<i>But in a way,
I felt better than I had in months.</i>

31:42.945 --> 31:46.198
For the first time in a long while...

31:48.033 --> 31:52.371
I was proud to be Máximo Gallardo.
