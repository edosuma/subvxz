00:01.831 --> 00:05.769
Quick! This way.
The barn. A girl in distress!

00:05.799 --> 00:08.354
- What distress?
- Go.

00:13.948 --> 00:15.925
- What is this?
- The girl is a pig!

00:16.487 --> 00:18.286
The pig is your present!

00:18.321 --> 00:21.593
This is a party!
Happy birthday!

00:22.117 --> 00:23.566
Happy birthday.

00:23.601 --> 00:25.945
Why here? Why not in the forest?

00:26.449 --> 00:29.883
There's gratitude for you!
Cos it's a surprise!

00:30.354 --> 00:35.107
And besides, this way the people of
Nettlestone can join us and say thank you.

00:36.356 --> 00:38.557
Speaking of which,
where is everyone? George?

00:39.290 --> 00:40.891
They couldn't make it.

00:41.284 --> 00:42.683
And neither can I.-

00:42.979 --> 00:44.120
mean, they couldn't make it?

00:44.155 --> 00:46.449
This is Robin Hood's
birthday, where are they?

00:46.484 --> 00:48.130
- George?
- Sorry.

00:48.165 --> 00:49.776
Sorry? What for?

00:51.312 --> 00:52.792
Oh, Much.

01:00.098 --> 01:01.290
Thank you.

01:09.555 --> 01:11.083
Happy birthday, Robin Hood!

01:11.356 --> 01:12.423
- Who's that?
- Ellingham.

01:12.458 --> 01:15.549
- The Sheriff sends his best.
- Leader ofthe Sheriff's mercenaries!

01:15.584 --> 01:18.344
Not to mention his best men!

01:19.780 --> 01:21.069
Much!

01:22.412 --> 01:23.700
Sorry!

02:04.796 --> 02:06.069
Will, Djaq, I need numbers.

02:06.340 --> 02:09.545
Oh, I'm gonna die! Not because
of them, but because of shame!

02:09.580 --> 02:13.514
- Much! Nobody is going to die!
- Why didn't I have it in the forest?

02:13.549 --> 02:17.447
In the forest, not in a village where
we can be betrayed and surrounded!

02:18.593 --> 02:21.203
Nettlestone is getting
nothing this winter.

02:21.312 --> 02:22.848
Much! Shut up!

02:24.011 --> 02:25.135
- Do you have a plan?
- No.

02:25.170 --> 02:27.894
- Half a plan?
- I don't have half a plan!

02:28.715 --> 02:30.499
- How many, Djaq?
- 30, 40?

02:30.534 --> 02:32.772
40?!
We're dead!

02:33.870 --> 02:35.030
Wait.

02:36.918 --> 02:38.591
There's more on that side. 100!

02:47.288 --> 02:48.560
They're coming!

02:50.706 --> 02:52.081
Barricade the door.

02:52.338 --> 02:53.297
No, wait!

02:54.116 --> 02:55.265
I've got this.

03:00.266 --> 03:02.546
Hood! Hood! Hood!

03:03.028 --> 03:06.196
I'm sorry, Robin.
This was meant for your birthday.

03:08.379 --> 03:09.900
Much, Will, open the door.

03:19.534 --> 03:20.973
- What's that?
- A pig!

03:28.630 --> 03:29.820
Black powder, Djaq?

03:30.421 --> 03:32.566
I told you I never
wanted to see that again.

03:32.601 --> 03:35.773
- I disobeyed you.
- Good.

03:36.586 --> 03:38.443
- Have you got any more?
- None.

03:41.123 --> 03:43.053
There's more where
that came from, Ellingham.

03:43.628 --> 03:46.212
We've got enough black
powder to destroy a whole army!

03:46.502 --> 03:47.630
You're bluffing!

03:50.534 --> 03:51.877
Get a message to the Sheriff.

03:57.646 --> 03:59.063
Now, that should buy us some time.

04:00.760 --> 04:01.911
We need to think.

04:03.599 --> 04:05.792
There are five of us
and a hundred of them.

04:07.591 --> 04:11.145
Once, a few determined Spartans held
a pass against a vast Persian army.

04:11.401 --> 04:13.273
- Really?
- Strategy.

04:13.308 --> 04:15.885
- And they lived?
- No.

04:17.118 --> 04:18.930
But they did well.

04:19.391 --> 04:21.510
Oh. I hate that story, too.

04:25.976 --> 04:27.462
Come in.

04:29.488 --> 04:31.423
Today is the 14th October.

04:31.458 --> 04:34.210
- Robin Hood's birthday.
- It is. It is?

04:36.707 --> 04:37.970
Marian...

04:39.386 --> 04:42.031
apart from your escapades
as the Nightwatchman,

04:42.507 --> 04:45.310
is there anything else
that you'd like to tell me?

04:47.536 --> 04:48.595
No.

04:49.538 --> 04:50.626
Good.

04:52.274 --> 04:55.508
Well, I came to tell you
that I'm going away.

04:55.803 --> 04:58.267
- Away? Where?
- I cannot say.

04:59.354 --> 05:02.562
But when I return,
things will be different.

05:02.964 --> 05:05.819
Better for me.
Better for us.

05:06.059 --> 05:07.471
Guy, what's going on?

05:07.806 --> 05:09.422
Marian, I will not be
here to supervise you.

05:09.456 --> 05:11.962
I must be assured that
the Nightwatchman is finished.

05:11.997 --> 05:16.645
- Yes, but... Where are you going?
- Marian, do I have your word?

05:20.504 --> 05:22.022
You have my word.

05:28.923 --> 05:30.618
Are we going to kill them?

05:30.876 --> 05:32.099
Yes!

05:32.756 --> 05:36.237
- Are we going to like it?
- Yes!

05:36.272 --> 05:40.030
- Are we going to kill them?
- Yes!

05:40.065 --> 05:42.363
Are we going to like it?

05:42.398 --> 05:45.624
- Yes!
- Are we going to kill them?

05:45.659 --> 05:47.603
Yes!

05:47.638 --> 05:50.325
- Are we going to like it?
- Horrible...

05:50.591 --> 05:52.491
Don't take any notice.

05:53.733 --> 05:55.491
All they're trying to
do is mess with our heads.

05:56.052 --> 05:57.484
It shows they're
playing for time.

05:57.519 --> 06:00.549
See if there's any water in
those barrels and fill those buckets.

06:00.889 --> 06:03.434
- Why?
- In case they try to burn us out!

06:03.592 --> 06:07.488
- Are we going to like it?
- Course.

06:07.523 --> 06:11.385
- Are we going to kill them?
- Yes!

06:12.209 --> 06:14.170
We're going to love it.

06:32.190 --> 06:33.941
Keep an eye on that bag, yeah?

06:34.407 --> 06:36.997
- Your boy is ready?
- Looks like it.

06:37.070 --> 06:39.688
- He knows where we're going?
- I told him Portsmouth. That's it.

06:39.723 --> 06:41.627
- Good.
- My Lord, the mercenaries,

06:41.628 --> 06:43.139
are you sure we
shouldn't bring them?

06:43.157 --> 06:45.958
With any luck, by now they'll
be celebrating Hood's birthday.

06:47.638 --> 06:52.070
No, we'll do this alone, quietly.

06:55.959 --> 06:57.216
Have they told you why?

06:57.632 --> 07:00.184
We going to Portsmouth,
that's alll know, Marian. All right?

07:00.785 --> 07:02.765
- You didn't get that from me.
- You know what this means?

07:02.800 --> 07:03.899
- No.
- The King.

07:03.934 --> 07:06.388
They must be expecting the
King to land in Portsmouth.

07:06.423 --> 07:08.843
- It could be anything.
- That's not good enough Allan.

07:10.112 --> 07:11.575
Now, what if it is the King?

07:12.072 --> 07:14.314
You know what they'll do
to him when he arrives.

07:14.349 --> 07:17.128
It's not my call, is it?
I'm the whipping boy around here.

07:17.163 --> 07:18.033
The packing boy.

07:18.068 --> 07:21.821
Look, if you go along with treason,
then you are committing treason.

07:22.139 --> 07:23.287
Rubbish.

07:23.288 --> 07:26.840
If you go along with farting, doesn't
mean you've farted yourself, does it?

07:27.987 --> 07:29.717
What's happened to you?

07:30.242 --> 07:32.803
I've learned which side
my bread's buttered on.

07:43.893 --> 07:45.596
Robin!

07:51.357 --> 07:52.742
Robin!

07:53.317 --> 07:54.767
Where are you?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.704
I need to stop the Sheriff.

08:02.704 --> 08:04.652
Come along, you blithering oaf!

08:04.687 --> 08:06.601
We haven't got all day! Gently!

08:07.921 --> 08:10.624
Move! Tanning cream.
Bottles of... Ah!

08:12.106 --> 08:13.812
News from Nettlestone?
Nice?

08:14.683 --> 08:16.444
Nasty?
Both?

08:17.882 --> 08:19.156
Small problem.

08:20.278 --> 08:22.680
Exploding fire?
What do you mean, exploding fire?

08:22.980 --> 08:24.371
Black powder.

08:26.148 --> 08:27.315
Yes, I know what it is!

08:27.668 --> 08:30.324
We want permission to burn
down the barn. They'll be toast.

08:30.359 --> 08:32.631
Are you deaf?
I told you.

08:33.184 --> 08:36.631
I want Robin Hood's pretty little face,
on his pretty little head,

08:36.666 --> 08:41.917
attached to his pretty little body on
a pretty big spike outside my castle!

08:42.174 --> 08:44.222
Then what do we do?
He's got food in there for a week.

08:44.256 --> 08:49.009
I don't care what you do!
I don't care how long it takes!

08:49.408 --> 08:51.815
Bring me Hood's body on a spike!

09:13.195 --> 09:14.928
Right.
John, Will, Djaq.

09:15.265 --> 09:17.104
Everyone, get ready to run.

09:18.280 --> 09:19.231
What are you doing?

09:19.266 --> 09:22.242
I'm the one who go us in
this situation, I'll get us out of it.

09:22.277 --> 09:24.918
I'll go out the front,
I'll pretend to negotiate,

09:24.953 --> 09:28.455
I'll distract them, you make
good your escape. If I die...

09:30.967 --> 09:32.263
- remember me fondly.
- Much...

09:32.298 --> 09:33.900
- Stop!
- What are you doing?

09:36.493 --> 09:38.315
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

09:38.983 --> 09:43.240
I'm unarmed. I'm here to
surrender and negotiate...

09:48.971 --> 09:51.316
Thank you!
Horrible people.

09:52.362 --> 09:53.571
Revolting.

10:03.695 --> 10:06.103
Allan.
I can't find Robin.

10:06.879 --> 10:07.920
I wouldn't worry about it.

10:07.943 --> 10:09.286
This trip, it'sjust me, Giz and the Sheriff.

10:09.902 --> 10:11.509
No soldiers, no mercenaries.

10:11.830 --> 10:12.966
I don't think it's the King, Marian.

10:13.399 --> 10:15.846
Yes, welll do. And I'm going to stop it.

10:16.382 --> 10:17.615
- How?
- I don't know.

10:18.582 --> 10:20.022
I'll kill the Sheriff if I have to.

10:20.438 --> 10:23.959
What? Have you forgotten what
happens if the Sheriff dies?

10:23.994 --> 10:24.845
No.

10:24.880 --> 10:26.957
Prince john's armies will
raze Nottingham to the ground.

10:26.992 --> 10:28.104
So, leave it.

10:28.359 --> 10:31.420
Yes, if the King is in the south, that's
where Prince john's men will be.

10:31.526 --> 10:33.156
Nottingham will be safe.

10:33.191 --> 10:34.622
That's a lot of assumptions there.

10:35.436 --> 10:37.711
And if I prevent the
Sheriff from killing the King,

10:38.218 --> 10:41.834
then that's the King back on the throne.
That's the end of Prince john.

10:41.869 --> 10:44.275
The end of the Black Knights
and the end of their threats.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.306
So... You want to save
England single-handedly?

10:46.341 --> 10:47.919
No, but I can't find Robin!

10:48.439 --> 10:52.071
Gisborne and the Sheriff are ready to leave.
There's no time. Will you help me?

10:52.106 --> 10:54.581
- Sorry, you're out of your depth.
- No, I'm sorry.

10:56.902 --> 10:58.950
You underestimate me.

11:07.895 --> 11:09.608
Allan!

11:19.995 --> 11:23.203
My Lords, wonderful news...

11:25.164 --> 11:26.634
My Lords...

11:28.588 --> 11:30.373
Glorious news.

11:34.548 --> 11:39.405
We, the Black Knights, stand
on the verge of greatness.

11:43.177 --> 11:46.987
We did not wait for Mohammed
to come to the mountain. No.

11:48.074 --> 11:51.971
We took the mountain
to Mohammed!

11:52.724 --> 11:55.901
We did not wait
for the King to land...

12:00.546 --> 12:04.347
Mistake, missy. Big mistake.

12:21.181 --> 12:22.948
We've got time, Hood.

12:23.662 --> 12:26.622
- All the time in the world.
- Us too!

12:26.657 --> 12:29.606
Would you like some more
roast hog while you're waiting?

12:29.641 --> 12:33.133
I don't understand.
What kind of soldiers are these?

12:33.134 --> 12:35.445
They're not doing anything.

12:35.520 --> 12:39.521
Mercenaries. They fight
for money, not passion.

12:40.504 --> 12:43.089
That is why. They do not
want to fight and die.

12:43.658 --> 12:45.289
So, what, you think they're
just going to wait?

12:45.353 --> 12:47.190
Yep. Looks like it.

12:48.589 --> 12:50.422
And we can't escape from here.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.566
They're just going to
wait until we come out.

12:55.222 --> 12:57.733
And then kill us.
Not even a conversation.

13:07.556 --> 13:09.386
You missed all the fun, Gisborne.

13:10.466 --> 13:13.218
Your leper friend tried to kill me.

13:16.995 --> 13:19.546
- Did you know about this?
- I didn't know anything.

13:20.963 --> 13:23.259
Why would he know
anything about this?

13:23.868 --> 13:25.396
She knocked him
out and took his sword.

13:25.651 --> 13:27.600
- What?
- Well, I wasn't expecting it, was I?

13:27.635 --> 13:30.888
It wouldn't have happened.
Yeah, she's good. I'm better though.

13:43.985 --> 13:46.826
'She's good,
but I'm better. '

13:47.466 --> 13:52.436
That means you knew
she was capable of this.

13:57.107 --> 14:00.133
- You knew, too, didn't you?
- My Lord, please, I can explain.

14:00.168 --> 14:05.649
Well, you better had explain because
she just made an attempt on my life!

14:11.694 --> 14:15.127
I recently discovered that
Marian was the Nightwatchman.

14:19.271 --> 14:23.023
What?
And you didn't tell me!

14:23.058 --> 14:25.063
I believed Marian's days as
the Nightwatchman were over.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.729
- I believed I had dealt with it.
- By tricking me!

14:28.033 --> 14:29.705
By faking her escape?!

14:32.146 --> 14:34.002
Who was it who ran away?

14:36.251 --> 14:37.945
Look, I was just following
orders, all right?

14:37.946 --> 14:38.989
- I gave the order.
- Why?

14:38.990 --> 14:42.419
I thought Marian's instincts were
misguided and did not merit hanging.

14:42.725 --> 14:44.609
Oh, how very noble of you, dear boy.

14:44.860 --> 14:48.101
I can't help thinking that maybe
you wanted something in return.

14:48.758 --> 14:52.445
A display of gratitude?
Oh, the Nightwatchman!

14:52.480 --> 14:54.729
- I'm impressed!
- Get off me!

14:55.049 --> 14:57.563
Guards!
Pack a trunk for Lady Marian.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.323
- She's coming with us.
- To the Holy Land?

15:04.343 --> 15:05.753
Oh, yes.

15:07.984 --> 15:10.136
Oh, look, look, the look.

15:10.777 --> 15:11.977
So eloquent.

15:12.234 --> 15:14.666
'Oh, Guy, what's going to happen?'

15:16.738 --> 15:19.588
Well, we just don't know, do we, missy?

15:25.708 --> 15:28.284
Listen, Guy, the Holy Land?

15:29.821 --> 15:34.643
Is this what I think it is?
Are we killing the King?

15:34.678 --> 15:36.917
You're part of the inner sanctum now,
Allan. You should be honoured.

15:37.500 --> 15:41.747
No, no. I am. I am. It's
just... the Holy Land?

15:41.782 --> 15:44.314
This is the ultimate mission.
It carries with it the ultimate prize.

15:44.556 --> 15:46.464
Absolute power.

15:46.499 --> 15:49.256
- Yeah, for you and the Sheriff.
- And you.

15:49.643 --> 15:52.648
Allan, your loyalty will be
rewarded in land and title.

15:52.683 --> 15:54.144
- I'll see to that.
- Really?

15:54.179 --> 15:55.608
- Really.
- What you mean...

15:56.992 --> 15:58.360
Like a lordship or something?

16:28.493 --> 16:29.605
Now what?

16:41.663 --> 16:44.910
This is driving me mad! Why don't
they just come in here and kill us?

16:44.945 --> 16:46.818
Cos there's no incentive, Much.

16:47.907 --> 16:50.526
Every hour that goes by,
we become more fearful,

16:51.576 --> 16:54.901
more tired, more likely
to take foolish action.

16:54.936 --> 16:57.149
Foolish action was bringing
us here in the first place.

16:57.184 --> 16:58.332
I've said I'm sorry.

16:58.367 --> 16:59.480
That's not good enough.

17:00.326 --> 17:03.405
Oh, you've never made a mistake
I'm not saying anything!

17:03.914 --> 17:04.959
- What?
- I'm not saying anything.

17:04.993 --> 17:06.005
You brought the Sheriff to our camp!

17:07.828 --> 17:12.045
- You showed him where we lived.
- I was trying to feed the poor!

17:12.079 --> 17:14.875
That's what we used to do!
What's this all about?

17:14.910 --> 17:18.636
- Feeding your fat face!
- Fat face! Look who's talking!

17:18.671 --> 17:21.151
Shut up, the pair of you!

17:22.470 --> 17:24.685
This is exactly what
they want us to do.

17:25.505 --> 17:27.465
Fighting amongst ourselves
and save them the trouble.

17:27.770 --> 17:30.113
Don't give them the satisfaction!

17:34.172 --> 17:38.228
- In fact, I think we need to relax.
- Relax?!

17:38.263 --> 17:39.627
I don't know why
I didn't think of this before.

17:39.662 --> 17:43.051
It's my birthday.
Let's celebrate. Let's eat.

17:46.203 --> 17:46.965
I haven't got a fat face.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.301
- Fat face.
- Badger beard!

17:52.855 --> 17:54.527
Are you seriously going
to the Holy Land?

17:54.750 --> 17:55.940
Yes, yes.

17:57.032 --> 17:58.471
I've never been before, have you?

17:59.067 --> 18:00.836
They say the weather's wonderful.

18:02.924 --> 18:06.333
Guy's been before, haven't you, Gizzy?

18:07.038 --> 18:08.333
You've been before?

18:10.717 --> 18:11.990
Then it's true?

18:13.358 --> 18:14.920
You tried to kill the King.

18:16.399 --> 18:18.544
What? Do you feel betrayed?

18:20.184 --> 18:22.116
Are you going to try
to kill the King again?

18:22.117 --> 18:23.330
YES.

18:24.042 --> 18:26.552
You could say that
it's Robin Hood's fault.

18:26.587 --> 18:29.714
You see, Robin did warn the King to
be on his guard when he lands.

18:30.146 --> 18:35.412
So, first plan, mercenaries in
the port, dead in the water.

18:37.035 --> 18:40.278
The new plan, instead of waiting
for him, we pay him a little visit.

18:41.189 --> 18:42.933
Mohammed not coming
to the mountain.

18:44.164 --> 18:46.165
Indeed. Shall I use that?

18:59.567 --> 19:00.776
Quite good.

19:03.929 --> 19:05.713
Are you listening, Robin Hood?

19:16.600 --> 19:18.103
Be careful.

19:29.378 --> 19:31.866
We thought you might
like some apple with your pork!

19:32.226 --> 19:33.978
Enjoy your meal!

19:34.346 --> 19:37.778
And just to let you know, we
won't be troubling you tonight.

19:38.158 --> 19:39.407
Or tomorrow.

19:39.679 --> 19:43.511
- We're going to starve you out of there!
- You better come back next Tuesday then.

19:44.765 --> 19:47.357
We've got enough food and
water to last a week here!

19:47.765 --> 19:49.726
A week?
Is that all you can last?

19:50.557 --> 19:51.589
What a shame!

19:51.925 --> 19:53.660
The Sheriff's paying us by the day!

19:56.614 --> 19:59.247
Ah. You're a funny man!
Do us a favour.

19:59.282 --> 20:03.633
Next time, bring some
mustard as well, will ya?

20:06.977 --> 20:09.163
- We don't have water for a week.
- I know that.

20:09.843 --> 20:12.090
- What are we going to do?
- Do you think they're bluffing?

20:12.427 --> 20:15.747
It doesn't matter.
Either way we're beaten.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.831
Well, one thing's for certain,
we can'tjust sit here and eat pork!

20:21.143 --> 20:22.575
Lads...

20:25.959 --> 20:27.816
I've got a proposal.

20:29.224 --> 20:31.928
- If they don't come to us, we go to them.
- When?

20:32.209 --> 20:33.431
- First light.
- There's too many.

20:33.466 --> 20:34.969
- We'll die.
- It's suicide.

20:39.471 --> 20:42.646
- A good day to die.
- Will you just shut up?

20:42.681 --> 20:46.080
Why does he say that?
I don't even know what it means!

20:46.115 --> 20:47.777
We'll almost certainly die.

20:49.203 --> 20:51.788
- But at least we'll die fighting.
- Yeah, I'm in.

20:52.741 --> 20:54.206
- Me too.
- Yes.

20:56.590 --> 21:00.213
- And me.
- Good, good.

21:03.420 --> 21:06.167
Then tonight is a Kalilah
and Dimnah night.

21:06.262 --> 21:07.411
What?

21:07.510 --> 21:08.982
You don't have Kalilah and Dimnah?

21:09.653 --> 21:11.070
Surprisingly not.

21:11.495 --> 21:13.941
Kalilah and Dimnah night,
you remember for your whole life.

21:14.238 --> 21:17.214
You must speak only the truth.
You must ask all your questions.

21:18.122 --> 21:20.957
Share all your dreams.
Confess all your secrets.

21:20.992 --> 21:22.943
- It's just talking.
- Yes!

21:22.978 --> 21:24.370
But it's real talking.

21:25.466 --> 21:30.357
And if you're too boring, someone shouts
Kalilah and you lose your turn. You start.

21:30.923 --> 21:33.004
- Oh, no.
- Just talk. You like talking.

21:33.627 --> 21:38.163
- I knowl do, but... not like this.
- Fine, then I'll start.

21:49.778 --> 21:51.905
- How many beds are you after?
- Three.

21:52.570 --> 21:55.071
- And you, with the horses?
- No, no. This one.

21:58.778 --> 22:00.011
You'd better not sleep tonight.

22:00.802 --> 22:02.703
Robin Hood will find
out what you're doing

22:02.738 --> 22:04.958
and he will come
and he will stop you.

22:05.809 --> 22:08.072
It's Robin Hood's birthday
today, did you know that?

22:08.721 --> 22:11.408
He's having a party
in Nettlestone village.

22:13.393 --> 22:17.730
And somebody has invited one
hundred of my fiercest mercenaries.

22:19.546 --> 22:22.073
And they've got him surrounded.

22:22.595 --> 22:25.154
So... So, Robin Hood is no more.

22:27.500 --> 22:31.453
Well, sleep tight.
Don't let the horse flies bite.

22:37.205 --> 22:39.382
Allan! Allan!

22:44.318 --> 22:46.726
- You can't go through with this.
- Yes, I can.

22:47.543 --> 22:49.318
You heard them, Marian.
Robin's finished.

22:49.353 --> 22:50.998
Not if we get away.

22:51.814 --> 22:53.134
We'll go back to Nottingham.

22:54.535 --> 22:55.999
We have to help him.

22:56.270 --> 22:58.160
- Allan!
- Coming.

23:10.945 --> 23:12.297
So, I admire you.

23:13.106 --> 23:17.040
All of you.
You are a good man.

23:17.546 --> 23:21.231
Brave, generous, kind,

23:21.998 --> 23:24.695
decent men and I love you.

23:25.574 --> 23:26.823
All of you.

23:28.183 --> 23:30.174
And I am proud
to be amongst you-

23:30.209 --> 23:31.650
Is this just everyone saying
they love each other?

23:31.685 --> 23:34.295
Wait...
And you're filthy.

23:34.954 --> 23:37.260
And you really stink
and you have no souls.

23:37.739 --> 23:39.979
- We live in the forest.
- I have to be honest!

23:43.145 --> 23:44.801
I have to be honest.

23:47.330 --> 23:49.074
And if I am being honest...

23:51.463 --> 23:52.991
I have to say...

23:54.009 --> 23:58.240
that I do not love all
of you in the same way.

23:58.241 --> 23:59.417
It's me, isn't it?

23:59.451 --> 24:01.579
You love everyone, but you don't
love me. Brilliant.

24:01.614 --> 24:03.219
There is one...

24:04.907 --> 24:06.699
I do love.

24:07.236 --> 24:09.069
More than the others.

24:09.507 --> 24:11.243
The way a bird would...

24:11.693 --> 24:14.556
fly two thousand miles,

24:15.389 --> 24:19.638
through storms, just to
be with the one he loves!

24:20.686 --> 24:22.734
That is the love I feel.

24:25.119 --> 24:29.817
And I am a fool! Because it is only now,
when we are about to die...

24:33.673 --> 24:38.266
that I have the courage
to admit it, even to myself.

24:40.353 --> 24:41.923
I'm sorry.

24:44.026 --> 24:46.753
- I should have said earlier.
- Will!

24:47.735 --> 24:48.847
I knew it.

24:49.478 --> 24:53.911
You, Will Scarlett, are strong and true.

24:54.215 --> 24:56.968
And you fight for what you believe in.

24:57.248 --> 24:58.809
And that's why I love you.

24:59.088 --> 25:00.361
And I love you.

25:01.226 --> 25:03.240
I love the way you
say what you mean.

25:03.904 --> 25:06.418
- I love your silly voice.
- Silly voice?

25:06.453 --> 25:10.968
That's it. I take it back all of it.
I hate you.

25:11.003 --> 25:14.088
And I love
the way you fight like a man.

25:15.096 --> 25:16.288
Ferocious!

25:18.792 --> 25:23.362
And the way you will always,
always be a woman.

25:23.753 --> 25:25.098
Kalimnah! Boring!

25:25.458 --> 25:27.018
- Kalilah!
- Whatever.

25:47.140 --> 25:48.469
Can I trust you?

25:50.637 --> 25:51.958
Yeah, of course.

25:53.709 --> 25:55.583
- Tell me.
- Tell you what?

25:55.618 --> 25:57.649
Robin Hood and Marian.

25:59.793 --> 26:00.874
What about them?

26:02.003 --> 26:05.211
They're still... aren't they?

26:07.139 --> 26:09.603
Even if they were,
he's finished now, right?

26:09.638 --> 26:11.538
That is not an answer, Allan.
I need to know.

26:15.944 --> 26:17.982
What's this,
kissing in the moonlight?

26:18.508 --> 26:20.731
Shall I go out and come in again?
What do you think?

26:20.766 --> 26:23.417
- Go to bed.
- Yeah.

26:29.896 --> 26:31.288
John?

26:32.297 --> 26:33.328
No.

26:33.632 --> 26:36.440
- John, come on.
- Who do you love?

26:40.705 --> 26:43.402
You. All of you.
Even him.

26:44.081 --> 26:45.514
I love you all. All right?

26:58.804 --> 27:00.469
And Alice.

27:01.780 --> 27:03.557
I shouldn't have let her go.

27:04.029 --> 27:05.269
And my boy.

27:05.749 --> 27:07.253
Little Little john.

27:09.014 --> 27:11.767
I should have...
made them stay.

27:12.095 --> 27:14.646
- John, you didn't have a choice.
- Let me speak.

27:16.024 --> 27:21.537
Leaving Alice, running
to the forest... was wrong.

27:22.977 --> 27:24.553
Wrong.

27:25.379 --> 27:31.290
That's why I'm a huge, ugly,
stupid, useless COWARD!

27:31.925 --> 27:34.869
- John!
- That's why I'm always saying it, Much.

27:35.650 --> 27:39.368
Today is a good day to die.
Because for me it is.

27:40.270 --> 27:45.118
I deserve to die.
I left the people that loved me.

27:45.153 --> 27:49.066
The two people that should
have depended on me. My own child!

27:51.620 --> 27:54.537
- What was I thinking?!
- John?

27:55.256 --> 27:57.039
I'll not let you talk like this.

27:58.265 --> 27:59.616
I'm going now.

28:00.337 --> 28:01.921
- I won't wait till tomorrow.
- John.

28:01.956 --> 28:03.173
Let's move this cart.

28:06.214 --> 28:07.719
I need to die!

28:07.999 --> 28:10.743
I want to die! Let me die!

28:11.030 --> 28:12.358
- Let me die!
- John!

28:12.393 --> 28:15.070
Let me die! I want to die!

28:16.146 --> 28:18.491
Is this normal with
this Kalimnah thing?

28:19.483 --> 28:20.922
Cos it's weird.

29:01.113 --> 29:03.065
Robin, sorry.

29:08.850 --> 29:10.075
Look, I'm not doing this.

29:10.499 --> 29:11.530
- Fine.
- Good...

29:11.807 --> 29:14.447
Because I don't hate myself and
I'm not in love with anyone else so...

29:14.839 --> 29:17.401
- Fine.
- Fine. There's nothing to say, then.

29:20.676 --> 29:21.885
What?

29:22.940 --> 29:24.165
What?

29:24.565 --> 29:25.846
You're smiling.

29:26.573 --> 29:29.806
I'm smiling because usually it's
a struggle to shut you up.

29:31.061 --> 29:32.558
You think I talk too much?

29:34.590 --> 29:35.959
Well, I know that's what you think.

29:37.110 --> 29:38.432
Much talks too much.

29:39.246 --> 29:41.399
And eats too much,
worries too much.

29:43.392 --> 29:46.247
That's easy for you to say
because if I don't do it, then who does?

29:47.200 --> 29:47.962
It's all right for you.

29:47.997 --> 29:50.377
You can breeze through
life and be everyone's hero!

29:50.412 --> 29:53.431
and not worry about things
like the fire or food

29:53.432 --> 29:56.416
or a hole in your cape
or your birthday.

29:56.913 --> 30:00.715
Because good old, dependable
old Much will take care of that.

30:01.963 --> 30:05.043
Well, I'll tell you something,
you take me for granted.

30:05.915 --> 30:07.878
- You're sniggering.
- Much! I'm just saying...

30:07.913 --> 30:09.487
And you shouldn't!

30:10.440 --> 30:11.759
And I'm angry!

30:16.817 --> 30:19.601
And just because I love you, it
doesn't mean I can't hate you, too.

30:20.299 --> 30:22.398
And I hate you,
because in the Holy Land

30:22.433 --> 30:26.456
there was two of us and we were a
team and the things we went through,

30:26.491 --> 30:30.054
the horrors we saw, we
went through them together.

30:30.482 --> 30:33.578
And when we came home we
were like brothers, brothers in arms.

30:35.287 --> 30:36.912
And where is that now, eh?

30:38.287 --> 30:40.128
It's gone. That's where!

30:42.693 --> 30:45.591
We never talk.
We just don't.

30:48.935 --> 30:52.361
You made me a free man and
we're meant to be equals.

30:54.816 --> 30:56.451
We're not equals.

30:57.922 --> 31:00.153
The only thing that's changed around
here is you treat me like a servant,

31:00.188 --> 31:01.892
you don't treat me like your friend.

31:02.653 --> 31:04.612
That's not true.

31:08.645 --> 31:10.597
Is it true?

31:18.368 --> 31:20.144
Kalilah.

31:22.192 --> 31:24.953
Well, they're not coming
tonight, that's for sure.

31:29.794 --> 31:31.897
We'll make a
plan for the morning.

31:37.884 --> 31:39.069
Allan!

31:40.473 --> 31:42.376
- Thank you.
- I can't get the key.

31:42.918 --> 31:44.766
Go. Go quickly.

31:46.007 --> 31:48.864
What about you, though?
You've crossed the Sheriff now.

31:48.899 --> 31:52.239
I'll be fine. Go. Save Robin.

31:53.939 --> 31:55.228
Go.

31:56.330 --> 31:57.668
Who's there?

32:02.270 --> 32:03.751
I heard voices.

32:19.725 --> 32:21.661
We stay tight up until this point.

32:22.581 --> 32:23.981
And then we divide.

32:25.494 --> 32:28.046
Is everybody clear? Show me.

32:29.294 --> 32:30.448
I go here.

32:30.775 --> 32:32.400
Will and I... here.

32:32.838 --> 32:34.616
And then you switch positions
and you cover from the back.

32:36.184 --> 32:37.639
And after that?

32:38.360 --> 32:40.752
Much, I don't think there's
going to be an after that.

32:41.361 --> 32:43.169
Yeah, I know.

32:43.577 --> 32:45.481
First light. Nearly dawn.

32:49.867 --> 32:51.579
This is it.

32:54.283 --> 32:55.788
This is really it.

32:57.222 --> 32:58.668
Forget what I said.

33:00.547 --> 33:02.668
I don't want you to die
remembering me that way.

33:04.126 --> 33:06.565
I'll remember you as my loyal friend.

33:14.278 --> 33:16.255
Right, let's get the weapons ready.

33:16.855 --> 33:19.129
As soon as there is
light to see by, we go.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.729
No.

33:23.008 --> 33:24.951
- No!
- John, we agreed this.

33:26.792 --> 33:30.433
You have not spoken, Robin.
It's your turn.

33:32.721 --> 33:35.024
We have a few
moments left on this earth.

33:35.938 --> 33:38.432
Let me have my
thoughts to myself.

33:38.901 --> 33:40.716
I'll share them
with you in the next life.

33:40.751 --> 33:45.666
Robin, if there is a heaven,
yours is different from mine.

33:46.585 --> 33:47.943
If there isn't a heaven?

33:48.250 --> 33:50.176
- It's almost light.
- Robin.

33:54.572 --> 33:56.572
You know my thoughts.

33:58.061 --> 33:59.799
They are for the poor.

34:00.332 --> 34:01.814
They are for you.

34:04.038 --> 34:06.014
And they're for Marian.

34:07.391 --> 34:09.150
The woman I love.

34:11.030 --> 34:14.069
- The woman I recently gave a ring to...
- You're engaged?

34:17.927 --> 34:19.607
The woman who makes
me believe that,

34:19.913 --> 34:22.639
by a twist of fate, we might
just be able to see this through.

34:25.639 --> 34:27.920
And Much, I have
betrayed your friendship.

34:29.882 --> 34:31.626
But I think you know why.

34:33.873 --> 34:36.889
You see I can't face
the terrors we saw, I can't.

34:38.235 --> 34:40.003
Because I'm not as strong as you.

34:41.812 --> 34:47.699
I have to put them out of my mind because
if I don't, then I wouldn't be able to lead.

34:49.126 --> 34:51.083
I mean, Iwouldn't even be able to...

34:52.620 --> 34:53.981
What?

34:54.415 --> 34:56.590
- It doesn't matter.
- Be able to shoot?

34:57.564 --> 35:00.434
Shoot?
Of course, he can shoot.

35:00.469 --> 35:05.914
No. john's right.

35:11.364 --> 35:15.843
In the Holy Land, the men we saw, in bits...

35:18.324 --> 35:19.820
screaming.

35:22.765 --> 35:26.197
Every time I raise my bow, I see them.

35:27.822 --> 35:29.574
I hear them.

35:30.038 --> 35:34.334
And I know now,
whether it was right or wrong,

35:36.310 --> 35:39.664
what we did in the Holy Land,
it makes no difference.

35:40.872 --> 35:46.769
So, I have to try not to kill.
I have to avoid killing.

35:50.311 --> 35:53.247
I mean, God gave me a gift with bow.

35:54.479 --> 35:58.495
I can kill with my eyes closed, I mean,
I can kill a man from a thousand yards.

35:58.984 --> 36:03.383
And I have to try
everything in my power not to.

36:07.745 --> 36:12.515
And that's why I wasn't there for
you in your hour of need, my friend.

36:12.866 --> 36:15.577
Because I have to let
those memories go.

36:17.170 --> 36:19.693
I just have to be free.

36:23.915 --> 36:25.731
Why didn't you say?

36:26.835 --> 36:28.586
It doesn't matter now.

36:29.291 --> 36:31.507
In a few moments, we'll be free for ever.

36:48.351 --> 36:53.131
Well...
here's to freedom.

36:54.216 --> 36:55.913
Here's to the poor.

36:56.905 --> 36:59.778
Here's to the good
people we leave behind.

37:00.121 --> 37:04.801
- We are Robin Hood.
- We are Robin Hood.

37:07.219 --> 37:09.130
Thank you, my friends.

37:27.813 --> 37:30.133
I should have let you
look after me, Guy.

37:30.590 --> 37:32.382
I should have let you.

37:32.886 --> 37:34.750
I'm your boy.

37:35.037 --> 37:36.848
I'm nothing without you.

37:36.883 --> 37:40.688
Right from the very beginning,
I should have let you look after me.

37:52.521 --> 37:54.531
Guy, don't be too disappointed.

37:55.531 --> 37:57.401
- What?
- Your boy, Allan.

37:58.159 --> 38:01.396
He doesn't love you any more.
He's run away, he's lost his nerve.

38:02.604 --> 38:05.292
- I'll find him.
- No, no, no...

38:05.909 --> 38:09.054
Let him go.
We don't need him.

38:09.598 --> 38:11.837
It's better this way.
just us.

38:24.440 --> 38:26.743
What do you think, john? A good day?

38:27.119 --> 38:29.337
Yes. A good day.

38:50.932 --> 38:53.180
Morning.
Allan A Dale, Gisborne's man.

38:53.215 --> 38:55.176
- Looking for Ellingham?
- That's me.

38:55.916 --> 38:57.433
Sheriff sent me on an errand.

38:57.468 --> 38:59.513
He wants me to take the
outlaws to him at the castle.

38:59.548 --> 39:03.040
No. Sheriff says they have
to stay in there till they rot.

39:03.075 --> 39:04.496
Or till they come out to be shot.

39:04.531 --> 39:06.520
- Yeah? He's changed his mind.
- Why?

39:06.555 --> 39:09.042
It turns out they might
have some information he needs.

39:10.932 --> 39:12.219
I think it's probably...

39:12.906 --> 39:14.724
you know, Black Knight stuff.

39:15.660 --> 39:17.501
You'll be paid in full, obviously.

39:26.837 --> 39:30.117
- God speed till we meet again.
- See you in heaven, my friends.

39:34.441 --> 39:36.491
Excuse me, gents.
Coming through.

39:37.481 --> 39:39.298
Thank you.

39:40.602 --> 39:43.746
Right, let's move out!
Move out!

39:47.685 --> 39:48.885
Be ready.

39:49.693 --> 39:51.469
One... Two...

39:51.637 --> 39:53.110
- Allan!
- What?

39:53.145 --> 39:54.901
- Allan A. Dale!
- What?!

39:59.599 --> 40:02.503
Open up!
I'm here on behalf of the Sheriff.

40:02.905 --> 40:03.727
- Let him in.
- Kill him!

40:03.762 --> 40:05.799
Calm down.

40:07.792 --> 40:09.247
Oh, thank God.

40:09.728 --> 40:10.569
What do you want?

40:10.604 --> 40:12.550
- What do you want?
- Listen!

40:13.031 --> 40:15.798
We haven't got time to talk now, all right?
I've spun them a yarn.

40:15.833 --> 40:17.143
We've got to get out
of here before they...

40:17.178 --> 40:18.145
We?! We?!

40:18.180 --> 40:20.466
I'm with you. Trust me.

40:22.691 --> 40:25.131
I've been an idiot. I'm sorry.

40:25.132 --> 40:26.150
*********

40:26.185 --> 40:27.830
The Sheriff and Gisborne
are going to the Holy Land.

40:28.151 --> 40:30.117
- The Holy Land?
- They're on a boat from Portsmouth.

40:30.494 --> 40:32.358
They're going to kill the King.

40:36.642 --> 40:40.893
Right, we need to get
out of here. Now.

40:53.328 --> 40:56.822
Sea air, Gisborne.
Sea air.

41:02.566 --> 41:03.792
Well, come along.

41:04.350 --> 41:07.849
Give Gizzy a little kiss. No?

41:10.473 --> 41:13.784
On ward, driver, let's go
and kill a king, shall we?

41:19.198 --> 41:21.721
It's all right, it's all right.
They're coming quietly.

41:21.756 --> 41:23.321
The show's over.

41:26.302 --> 41:29.448
One thing. I got to get this
rabble back to the castle somehow.

41:29.483 --> 41:33.978
Sure. The Sheriff wants to
talk tothe outlaws in the castle?

41:34.013 --> 41:35.895
- Yeah.
- Strange that,

41:36.073 --> 41:41.067
because a little birdie told me that
the Sheriff left the castle yesterday.

41:41.174 --> 41:45.293
- You're joking! Did he?
- Nice try. Get them!

41:47.830 --> 41:50.077
You've got no chance.
You're going to die.

42:02.991 --> 42:06.062
We are going to die,
but not today!

42:19.623 --> 42:21.536
Good to have you back.

42:25.769 --> 42:27.682
She's with me.

42:28.642 --> 42:30.673
- Good to have you back.
- Good to be back.

42:36.103 --> 42:38.686
I told you you were going to die.

42:40.182 --> 42:43.944
And we said not today!
Come on, lads!

42:43.979 --> 42:46.766
Get them. Get them.

42:48.982 --> 42:52.287
What are you waiting for?
They're getting away.

43:04.166 --> 43:05.379
- To the camp?
- No time.

43:05.414 --> 43:06.602
There's something
I haven't told you.

43:06.637 --> 43:08.456
- What?
- The Sheriff has got Marian.

43:08.491 --> 43:10.036
- What?
- She wanted to save the King,

43:10.071 --> 43:13.006
so she tried to kill the
Sheriff and got caught.

43:16.455 --> 43:19.447
Allan's right. We haven't time.
We go to the coast. Now!

43:21.407 --> 43:24.216
I'm coming, my love.
I'm coming.

43:48.013 --> 43:49.476
Sheriff?

43:50.045 --> 43:52.678
Nasir.
My dear boy.

43:55.971 --> 43:57.397
Karim.

43:59.878 --> 44:01.605
Very good.

44:02.982 --> 44:05.046
Oh, very good.

44:05.509 --> 44:06.839
What is our plan?

44:07.351 --> 44:10.911
You are going to visit King Richard.

44:12.399 --> 44:17.792
- You are Saladin's new messenger.
- Saladin's royal seal.

44:18.474 --> 44:22.137
- Where did you get this?
- Saladin's old messenger.

44:22.172 --> 44:25.142
- But there is also a password.
- It was difficult getting that.

44:25.177 --> 44:27.099
Like pulling teeth. It was...

44:27.134 --> 44:30.274
- Pulling teeth!
- When we get in...

44:30.764 --> 44:31.754
I kill him?

44:31.789 --> 44:35.843
No, no, no. You won't get to within
a thousand yards ofthe King's tent.

44:36.868 --> 44:40.075
- I want you to lure him out.
- How?

44:40.716 --> 44:45.005
By telling him what he wants to hear.
Peace.

44:46.117 --> 44:49.271
Nothing can stop us now.

44:50.366 --> 44:53.327
Right, lads, work to do.

44:54.214 --> 44:59.079
Save Marian, save
the King, save England.

45:09.317 --> 45:12.890
- Food. You should eat.
- Guy, listen to me.

45:12.925 --> 45:16.001
Now that Robin is dead, you
are the King's last chance.

45:16.036 --> 45:20.834
If you save him from this plot he will
reward you with position and wealth.

45:21.539 --> 45:23.155
You'll have everything you wanted.

45:23.476 --> 45:26.692
Saving him from this plot?
How would that work?

45:34.631 --> 45:36.351
Kill the Sheriff.

45:36.783 --> 45:38.719
The King will reward you.

45:38.754 --> 45:40.503
And...

45:43.848 --> 45:45.936
And I will reward you.

45:46.479 --> 45:48.097
How?

45:49.674 --> 45:51.337
If you save the King...

45:53.113 --> 45:55.539
I will willingly give you my hand.

45:59.092 --> 46:02.700
He is a Black Knight.
I would trust him with my life.

46:02.735 --> 46:08.404
Ah, here he is now.
Ah, how's our leper friend?

46:11.573 --> 46:13.094
Whingeing as usual.

46:16.137 --> 46:18.917
What if the King's moved on?
What if he isn't in Acre?

46:18.952 --> 46:21.842
Then we'll find Djaq's
uncle's friend. Bassam.

46:21.877 --> 46:24.454
- I'll check upstairs. Ok?
- All right.

46:24.489 --> 46:27.031
What does Bassam do?
The pigeon handler.

46:27.066 --> 46:29.411
- Remember Lardner?
- The bird the Sheriff got with his buzzard?

46:29.446 --> 46:32.499
- That's what you think.
- We switched the pigeons.

46:32.534 --> 46:33.569
You're joking?!

46:34.505 --> 46:37.088
Nice one! So, you got the
message to the King in the end?

46:37.670 --> 46:39.943
Yeah, well, no thanks to you.

46:40.409 --> 46:43.280
Oh, look, I've told you a thousand times.
I'm sorry boys, all right?

46:43.315 --> 46:46.379
- I'm back now. I'm one of the lads, let's-
- Hands up who hasn't betrayed the group.

46:47.566 --> 46:48.957
Oh, this one again, how clever...

46:48.992 --> 46:50.847
- Just leave it, Much, eh?
- Sorry.

46:50.882 --> 46:53.755
- We just want to find the King.
- And Marian.

46:54.600 --> 46:57.304
- And Marian.
- Robin.

46:59.834 --> 47:01.531
I want to show you something.

47:03.755 --> 47:07.274
See those two guards there?
Saracen soldiers.

47:07.309 --> 47:10.425
That means this town is back
in the hands of my people.

47:10.460 --> 47:13.541
The town is under curfew
and it will be dangerous.

47:13.576 --> 47:16.946
The bad news is your King will not be here.

47:16.981 --> 47:17.900
Right.

47:19.731 --> 47:21.963
We find your friend Bassam.

48:02.110 --> 48:03.656
Can I ask you something?

48:04.175 --> 48:07.880
Being back here, in the Holy Land...

48:08.878 --> 48:12.368
Do you feel funny?
Cos I feel funny.

48:13.304 --> 48:14.944
To be the enemy again.

48:16.551 --> 48:18.866
If these people knew we were English...

48:19.502 --> 48:21.621
We have to find Marian.

48:32.897 --> 48:34.177
If we don't get Marian back-

48:34.212 --> 48:36.810
- We will find Marian...
- Robin!

48:48.267 --> 48:49.885
Get a grip, Marian.

48:52.109 --> 48:54.069
Robin's dead.

49:02.369 --> 49:03.479
Saracens!

49:26.159 --> 49:28.422
Three more this way!

49:42.526 --> 49:45.367
- Bassam's house?
- This way!

49:50.659 --> 49:52.202
These are Bassam's birds.

49:53.844 --> 49:56.372
It's as beautiful as I remember it.

49:58.940 --> 50:01.868
- Safiya?
- Bassam!

50:04.155 --> 50:05.477
You're still alive!

50:06.156 --> 50:09.084
- So are you!
- Me? I'm always alive.

50:09.119 --> 50:13.545
My body might fall to bits, but I'll
still have to tend to these birds.

50:13.927 --> 50:17.159
- But you love them.
- I love you.

50:23.777 --> 50:26.929
When I was a little girl,
I loved these birds.

50:27.600 --> 50:32.546
I thought that when I grew up,
I would live here and train them.

50:33.706 --> 50:36.867
The closest I'd ever get to flight.

50:37.835 --> 50:40.076
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

50:40.780 --> 50:42.700
Yeah, I do, actually.

50:43.012 --> 50:45.397
- Bismillah.
- Bismillah.

50:49.900 --> 50:51.572
He speaks our language.

50:52.669 --> 50:55.228
Well, you speak mine.
It seems only fair.

50:57.566 --> 51:00.501
- I need to find our King.
- Why should I help you?

51:00.536 --> 51:02.573
Because his life is in danger.

51:02.608 --> 51:06.506
You want to save him so that he can
continue waging war against our people?

51:06.541 --> 51:07.770
No.

51:07.805 --> 51:10.687
I want to take him home and make peace.

51:10.722 --> 51:14.648
So he can save his own people
from some very unpleasant men.

51:14.683 --> 51:18.702
Robin is a man of peace.
Trust him.

51:23.118 --> 51:24.991
Please.

51:27.328 --> 51:32.457
His camp is to the north.
I will show you in the morning.

51:32.492 --> 51:33.827
Thank you.

51:55.885 --> 51:57.948
<i>Yes, of course.
He can be trusted.</i>

51:57.983 --> 52:00.157
<i>If he says they are there,
then they are there.</i>

52:02.869 --> 52:04.918
Robin Hood?
Not possible.

52:05.237 --> 52:07.116
Here in Acre, with his men.
Looking for the King.

52:07.151 --> 52:09.382
- Not a problem.
- How so?

52:09.417 --> 52:13.039
They're still looking for him,
so they haven't found him yet.

52:13.781 --> 52:19.729
We're going to add a little something
extra to Saladin's message to the King.

52:20.608 --> 52:26.503
We're going to get
King Richard to kill Robin Hood.

52:54.455 --> 52:57.562
I am the envoy of his Royal
Highness Prince Saladin,

52:57.563 --> 53:02.256
rightful ruler of these lands.
Master of the Ayyubid dynasty.

53:02.291 --> 53:04.886
Yeah?
And I'm the King of England.

53:21.188 --> 53:22.621
Thank you, Carter.

53:29.320 --> 53:31.332
Keep still.

53:31.899 --> 53:33.380
Take him to the King's tent.

53:33.415 --> 53:37.796
Quartermaster, tell him three
dozen breast plates by sundown.

53:41.217 --> 53:43.778
- Where is your King?
- I rule from the front line.

53:44.519 --> 53:47.594
That's why your Prince
will never defeat me.

53:50.957 --> 53:54.849
I admire Aristotle.
I prefer Plato.

53:57.615 --> 54:00.159
You have the password. Speak.

54:00.759 --> 54:04.185
My Prince has considered
your calls for peace.

54:04.220 --> 54:08.813
He promises nothing,
but he is prepared to talk.

54:10.165 --> 54:15.216
My Prince agrees to meet you,
man to man, alone in the desert.

54:15.791 --> 54:17.047
Where?

54:17.574 --> 54:18.999
Outside Emius.

54:19.408 --> 54:21.704
The town ruined by your Crusaders.

54:22.424 --> 54:24.975
- When?
- Today. Noon.

54:25.010 --> 54:27.253
Your Majesty...
Is this wise?

54:30.173 --> 54:33.185
My Prince knew it, you do
not want peace.

54:34.514 --> 54:36.386
Wait!

54:36.706 --> 54:38.129
I'll be there.

54:39.618 --> 54:42.850
My Prince offers you a gift.

54:43.754 --> 54:45.739
As a sign of his goodwill.

54:46.315 --> 54:49.659
- What gift?
- The gift of life.

54:54.310 --> 54:55.839
Leave us.

54:58.600 --> 55:04.248
There are men in your country
who would want to kill you.

55:04.283 --> 55:06.692
Tell him thank you, but I know
about the Black Knights.

55:06.727 --> 55:09.558
- They know you know.
- I will deal with them when I return.

55:09.593 --> 55:13.652
That is why they have recruited your
most loyal servant to come here.

55:13.687 --> 55:14.096
Who?

55:14.131 --> 55:17.799
He is a man that you would
trust with your life

55:18.360 --> 55:21.765
and he travels with
a Saracen woman.

55:21.827 --> 55:27.817
He will offer to protect you and then,
when your guard is down...

55:29.661 --> 55:32.062
he will slit your throat.

55:42.791 --> 55:46.092
- This meeting. I'll come with you.
- No!

55:46.127 --> 55:49.191
Your Majesty, to meet
Saladin alone, unprotected...

55:49.226 --> 55:53.169
Sometimes, peace requires
more bravery than war.

55:56.552 --> 55:58.983
Have you thought
about what I said?

56:00.183 --> 56:03.196
You are a decent man, Guy.
You're not a killer.

56:04.527 --> 56:07.008
Turn against the Sheriff.

56:08.223 --> 56:13.179
This is your chance.
Your last chance to be a good man.

56:23.758 --> 56:25.506
Good chat with Marian?

56:27.648 --> 56:30.176
Anything you want to tell me?

56:32.936 --> 56:34.504
No.

56:39.378 --> 56:41.441
She wants me to kill you.

56:43.836 --> 56:45.914
And are you going to?

56:54.949 --> 56:56.493
No.

56:58.036 --> 57:00.117
What was her suggestion?

57:00.886 --> 57:04.813
Oh, I would kill you,
she would vouch for me.

57:05.566 --> 57:07.358
The King would reward me.

57:08.054 --> 57:10.117
I would still win power and
I would also win-

57:10.152 --> 57:11.641
Marian.

57:15.758 --> 57:17.320
But you chose me.

57:17.673 --> 57:20.640
My Lord, I demonstrated my loyalty.
Now I'd like your blessing.

57:20.675 --> 57:23.318
- For what?
- I will still have Marian.

57:23.549 --> 57:27.065
When we return to England,
I will take her by force.

57:28.501 --> 57:31.605
Dear boy, I'll sing
at your wedding.

57:44.911 --> 57:48.000
There. Your King's camp.

57:52.409 --> 57:54.289
Shukran, Bassam.

57:59.865 --> 58:03.182
Does he understand
flight, the pale one?

58:03.275 --> 58:08.074
Who?
Yes, I think he does.

58:08.911 --> 58:10.872
You have my blessing.

58:16.529 --> 58:20.042
My name is Robin of Locksley and these
are my friends, the King's loyal subjects.

58:20.410 --> 58:23.224
More than that. My master and
I served in his Private Guard.

58:23.259 --> 58:25.666
We have urgent
business with the King.

58:26.576 --> 58:30.576
- Saving his life, actually.
- John, look, the King's tent.

58:31.189 --> 58:32.654
Ut Prosim!

58:33.133 --> 58:35.982
- Our motto. Latin.
- What does it mean?

58:38.596 --> 58:41.301
That was us.
Good days.

58:41.336 --> 58:42.906
Well, not good.

58:42.941 --> 58:45.745
Death and destruction
and all that, but you know.

58:46.243 --> 58:48.998
- Ut prosim, lads.
- Robin!

58:49.505 --> 58:50.842
Carter!

58:53.228 --> 58:54.800
I thought you'd given up fighting?

58:54.835 --> 58:57.424
I'm still fighting, but for peace.

58:58.660 --> 59:01.119
Looks like we're finally making progress.

59:02.210 --> 59:04.134
Robin of Locksley.

59:04.169 --> 59:05.911
- Your Majesty.
- Up.

59:05.946 --> 59:09.555
I should bow before you, friend.
Come.

59:16.483 --> 59:17.465
Robin.

59:17.500 --> 59:20.795
Your Majesty, I bring grave news.

59:20.830 --> 59:22.763
- You received my messages, Itrust?
- I did.

59:23.606 --> 59:27.178
You'll know the Sheriff of Nottingham and
the Black Knights are plotting against you.

59:27.213 --> 59:29.103
They are planning to
take over England.

59:29.138 --> 59:31.330
That's what you said.
I believe you.

59:31.365 --> 59:34.712
But now the Sheriff is coming
here. To find you and kill you.

59:34.747 --> 59:35.535
Really?

59:35.570 --> 59:39.347
- You have to let me to protect you.
- I must allow you to protect me?

59:39.382 --> 59:40.491
Yes.

59:51.819 --> 59:55.572
- Oh, Robin. Of all people, you?
- Your Majesty?

59:55.607 --> 59:58.443
Of all who have served me,
you were the one I loved most.

59:58.478 --> 59:59.429
I cherished that.

59:59.464 --> 01:00:02.885
When I sent you home, I was sending a
piece of me and you would represent me.

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.223
In a small way, I think I have.

01:00:04.258 --> 01:00:06.789
- Robin, stop it. I know the truth.
- What truth?

01:00:06.824 --> 01:00:08.773
Your Majesty, you are in danger.

01:00:08.808 --> 01:00:10.980
Why? Have I not done right by you?

01:00:11.015 --> 01:00:13.506
Yes, you have... and I've
come here to save you!

01:00:13.541 --> 01:00:17.749
Still you deny it?
You have come here to murder your King!

01:00:17.784 --> 01:00:20.294
Your Majesty, no.
I can vouch for Robin.

01:00:20.329 --> 01:00:21.747
- When I was in England...
- Quiet!

01:00:22.565 --> 01:00:25.278
You are a renowned marksman
with the bow, are you not?

01:00:25.313 --> 01:00:26.060
I am.

01:00:26.095 --> 01:00:29.339
Then you could have killed
my enemies a thousand times over.

01:00:29.374 --> 01:00:34.031
You would travel to the Holy Land instead
of aiming an arrow in Nottingham?

01:00:34.066 --> 01:00:35.558
Your Majesty, we couldn't just
shoot the Sheriff, we can...

01:00:35.559 --> 01:00:37.925
- ********
- *********

01:00:38.596 --> 01:00:40.805
Assemble the men.

01:00:41.637 --> 01:00:43.604
Execute them.

01:00:47.159 --> 01:00:49.004
- Happiness?
- Happiness.

01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:51.395
He'll attend the meeting?

01:00:51.930 --> 01:00:55.217
And watch out, watch out,
there's a Hood about?

01:00:57.653 --> 01:00:59.686
Come to Daddy!

01:01:02.095 --> 01:01:04.248
So Karim, dear boy,
you know what to do?

01:01:04.283 --> 01:01:08.439
What if King Richard knows
what Prince Saladin looks like?

01:01:08.964 --> 01:01:11.822
Well, no matter. You're not
stopping for a chat, are you?

01:01:19.606 --> 01:01:21.400
Gisborne.
Something I need to do...

01:01:21.714 --> 01:01:23.234
Go with.

01:01:30.932 --> 01:01:33.547
Mercy, Your Majesty!
Ut prosim!

01:01:33.582 --> 01:01:36.534
Your Majesty.
These people are innocent.

01:01:36.569 --> 01:01:39.407
If you must take a life,
take mine, spare them.

01:01:39.442 --> 01:01:41.799
At last. That's the Robin I remember.

01:01:41.834 --> 01:01:45.129
- Considering others.
- He is still the Robin you remember.

01:01:45.164 --> 01:01:47.737
He saved your life!
Don't you remember that?

01:01:55.575 --> 01:01:57.936
I cannot grant your wish.
You must all be punished.

01:01:57.971 --> 01:02:00.413
But you once saved my life and no,
I've not forgotten that.

01:02:00.448 --> 01:02:02.412
So, I'll not take yours.

01:02:03.003 --> 01:02:04.763
I'll let the desert decide!

01:02:06.923 --> 01:02:10.243
The desert?
What does that mean?

01:02:11.050 --> 01:02:12.618
Decide what?

01:02:14.322 --> 01:02:16.297
This is the same as execution.

01:02:16.818 --> 01:02:19.498
Yes. But if God wills it,
there is always a chance.

01:02:20.979 --> 01:02:22.803
I'll not remember you
this way, Robin.

01:02:23.932 --> 01:02:26.005
I'll remember you as the
hero who once saved my life.

01:02:26.013 --> 01:02:28.939
And I'll remember you as the
King who spent too long at war.

01:02:28.974 --> 01:02:30.764
It has clouded your
judgment.

01:02:31.466 --> 01:02:33.347
You've forgotten your people back home.

01:02:35.823 --> 01:02:37.259
You're right.

01:02:37.852 --> 01:02:39.781
It is time to stop this fighting.

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:42.100
I am meeting Saladin. Today.

01:02:42.525 --> 01:02:45.852
I will make peace with him.
And then I will go home to England.

01:02:45.887 --> 01:02:47.496
Good.

01:02:48.548 --> 01:02:51.390
At least my friends and
I will have achieved something.

01:02:52.606 --> 01:02:54.342
Goodbye.

01:03:01.999 --> 01:03:03.263
Good chicken.

01:03:03.865 --> 01:03:06.903
I owe you a debt of
gratitude, young lady.

01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:11.883
Thanks to you,
I know that Guy is loyal.

01:03:12.850 --> 01:03:18.380
Because if you can't turn him with
your pretty little head, then nobody can.

01:03:18.771 --> 01:03:22.013
Your heart must be
the coldest place on earth.

01:03:22.048 --> 01:03:25.157
Are you a little disappointed
that he told me about your offer?

01:03:26.452 --> 01:03:28.384
I'm surprised
it took you so long,

01:03:28.385 --> 01:03:30.687
to be quite honest with you.
I was really getting rather bored.

01:03:30.721 --> 01:03:34.173
- Now I've served my purpose.
- You tried to kill me!

01:03:35.116 --> 01:03:37.339
Did you think I'm
going to let that pass?

01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:42.236
Robin Hood did not die in Nottingham.
Did you know this? Huh?

01:03:42.781 --> 01:03:43.868
Well, then.

01:03:44.227 --> 01:03:47.452
just as a treat, you can die together.

01:03:48.063 --> 01:03:49.894
This is good.

01:04:05.655 --> 01:04:10.000
- How long?
- In this heat... without water...

01:04:12.398 --> 01:04:15.358
I'm sorry, my love.
I should have made you stay with Bassam.

01:04:15.393 --> 01:04:18.615
I would never leave you,
Will Scarlett.

01:04:20.914 --> 01:04:22.818
If we can just get through
the nightfall, then, you know...

01:04:22.853 --> 01:04:24.352
- Then what?
Then...

01:04:26.274 --> 01:04:29.210
- It'll be cooler.
- Cooler. It'll be freezing!

01:04:29.245 --> 01:04:31.656
I know, but it won't be hot.

01:04:31.691 --> 01:04:37.203
This heat...
Much, we do not have till nightfall.

01:05:16.949 --> 01:05:19.045
You know I love you all.

01:05:20.782 --> 01:05:23.197
john, Djaq, Will.

01:05:25.502 --> 01:05:27.406
Even you, Allan.

01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:30.833
Robin.

01:05:32.552 --> 01:05:34.297
Master.

01:05:37.721 --> 01:05:40.257
When I was sewing the King,
I was sewing you.

01:05:42.441 --> 01:05:44.722
When I think of England, I think of you.

01:05:48.050 --> 01:05:49.786
Marian?

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:55.980
Marian.

01:05:58.076 --> 01:05:59.621
I see something.

01:06:00.044 --> 01:06:02.631
I can really see
something... coming!

01:06:06.926 --> 01:06:09.829
- He's right.
- Help!

01:06:09.864 --> 01:06:11.615
- Help us...
- Help!

01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:13.797
Help!

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:17.520
They've seen us.

01:06:17.555 --> 01:06:20.666
- God is smiling on us!
- Or Allah!

01:06:20.701 --> 01:06:23.166
Whichever God it is, I love him!

01:06:26.031 --> 01:06:28.496
It's the Sheriff.

01:06:29.688 --> 01:06:31.730
There is no God.

01:06:53.388 --> 01:06:55.683
You see, that's the trouble
with foreign travel.

01:06:56.630 --> 01:07:00.360
You run into all the same
people you see at home!

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:02.584
Your leper friend.

01:07:03.969 --> 01:07:05.984
I understand you've
met my colleague, james?

01:07:06.477 --> 01:07:07.690
We meet again.

01:07:08.578 --> 01:07:10.050
You let the Black Knights buy you?

01:07:10.322 --> 01:07:13.259
The pennies of the poor
put to good use! james.

01:07:13.763 --> 01:07:15.939
You're revolting. Get off me!

01:07:15.974 --> 01:07:19.511
Ah, a revolt is when the people
rise up against their leader.

01:07:19.546 --> 01:07:23.368
Now, I'm not revolting,
I am couping.

01:07:23.403 --> 01:07:28.016
Plotting a sudden and
decisive change of leader.

01:07:28.051 --> 01:07:29.508
What about murder?

01:07:30.006 --> 01:07:35.025
Ah, well, if the King will
wander out into the desert alone,

01:07:35.626 --> 01:07:37.727
unarmed, ready to
meet his enemy...

01:07:37.861 --> 01:07:40.867
The King wants peace. You're killing
a man who's trying to make peace.

01:07:40.902 --> 01:07:44.143
Yes, and life is usually so much fairer.

01:07:44.178 --> 01:07:46.743
Let Marian go. She's got
nothing to do with this.

01:07:46.744 --> 01:07:49.459
She has everything
to do with this.

01:07:50.402 --> 01:07:56.375
All along, we thought we
had a spy in your camp!

01:07:58.245 --> 01:07:59.868
But you had one in ours.

01:08:01.388 --> 01:08:03.955
You see, there will always
be people who work for me,

01:08:04.759 --> 01:08:06.693
because I fight for justice.

01:08:09.551 --> 01:08:10.855
But this...

01:08:11.302 --> 01:08:12.983
This one is a special one.

01:08:14.887 --> 01:08:16.823
You were still hoping, weren't you?

01:08:16.858 --> 01:08:21.935
That after all this you would end up as man
and wife back home in sunny Sherwood?

01:08:23.011 --> 01:08:26.221
So... now you have your bride.

01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:30.368
I'd love to stay, but I don't tan well.

01:08:31.742 --> 01:08:35.247
Do excuse us, we have a King to kill.
Come along, james.

01:08:43.917 --> 01:08:46.136
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.

01:08:46.171 --> 01:08:49.256
- We fought and we lost.
- But at least we will have died trying.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:51.433
I want to die in England.

01:08:51.930 --> 01:08:54.098
- In Sherwood.
- Come on, john.

01:08:54.133 --> 01:08:56.684
Today is a good day to die.
You're always saying it.

01:08:56.719 --> 01:08:59.892
Today is NOT a good day to die!

01:09:01.372 --> 01:09:05.380
I want to die in the arms of my wife...

01:09:07.837 --> 01:09:12.863
with my son, john, by my side...

01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:18.495
John, you're dying for England,
even if you're not there.

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:23.439
Not being funny, it's the King of England
who put us here in the first place.

01:09:23.474 --> 01:09:25.528
The Sheriff's spun him a story!

01:09:26.136 --> 01:09:28.201
The moment we arrived
here we were marked men.

01:09:29.770 --> 01:09:31.304
It's not the King's fault.

01:09:38.738 --> 01:09:40.763
Say the words, then, handsome.

01:09:41.586 --> 01:09:43.050
What words?

01:09:43.363 --> 01:09:47.700
I, Robin, take you, Marian.

01:09:50.005 --> 01:09:51.277
Now?

01:09:52.133 --> 01:09:53.910
Now is a good time, I think.

01:09:55.326 --> 01:09:59.639
We are in the company of the
best witnesses England has to offer.

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.457
I, Robin...

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:11.872
take you, Marian,
to be my lawful wedded wife.

01:10:12.769 --> 01:10:17.249
To have and to hold,
for better or for worse...

01:10:19.835 --> 01:10:23.218
for richer, or for poorer...

01:10:26.835 --> 01:10:28.635
In sickness...

01:10:29.869 --> 01:10:31.971
In sickness or in health...

01:10:35.541 --> 01:10:37.326
to love and to cherish...

01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:42.566
'till death do us part.

01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:49.993
I, Marian, take you,
Robin of Locksley,

01:10:50.997 --> 01:10:52.685
master of the bow,

01:10:52.896 --> 01:10:55.512
champion of the
poor and lord of my heart,

01:10:56.609 --> 01:10:58.465
to be my lawful wedded husband.

01:11:00.265 --> 01:11:03.998
I promise to love
and to cherish you...

01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:07.801
for better or for worse,
from this day forward,

01:11:09.319 --> 01:11:11.676
as long as we both shall live.

01:11:13.796 --> 01:11:16.741
Much, don't cry!

01:11:19.125 --> 01:11:21.045
He's not crying.

01:11:21.749 --> 01:11:23.525
He's laughing on the
wrong side of his face.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:26.374
Carter!
I thought you'd left us.

01:11:27.204 --> 01:11:28.181
Sorry.

01:11:28.216 --> 01:11:29.693
Out here, you can lose your head.

01:11:31.045 --> 01:11:32.628
- I thought I didn't like you.
- I know.

01:11:35.271 --> 01:11:37.585
- I do now!
- I knew we'd find you...

01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:39.611
We have horses.
We have weapons.

01:11:39.646 --> 01:11:41.933
Then we have the King to rescue.
Come on!

01:11:41.968 --> 01:11:44.428
- We are Robin Hood!
- What?

01:11:44.972 --> 01:11:48.587
- We'll explain it later.
- No! Everybody say it.

01:11:49.027 --> 01:11:52.074
We are Robin Hood. Say it!

01:11:52.109 --> 01:11:54.590
- We are Robin Hood!
- We are Robin Hood!

01:12:01.974 --> 01:12:03.343
The desert decided.

01:12:07.712 --> 01:12:10.320
Where have you been?
You nearly missed the show.

01:12:11.721 --> 01:12:14.298
- Delhi belly.
- Where's Marian?

01:12:15.387 --> 01:12:16.979
She's, er... tied up.

01:12:18.868 --> 01:12:21.037
This is good, this is very good.

01:12:42.775 --> 01:12:45.976
- I am not really Saladin!
- I am not really King Richard!

01:12:46.011 --> 01:12:48.067
- It's Robin Hood!
- You should be dead.

01:12:48.102 --> 01:12:50.620
Many times over,
my friend, many times.

01:12:53.583 --> 01:12:54.672
Now do you believe us?

01:12:55.409 --> 01:12:56.818
I betrayed your loyalty.

01:12:58.114 --> 01:12:59.346
How can I repay you?

01:13:00.248 --> 01:13:03.665
Actually...
I know this is not the time,

01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:06.689
Your Majesty, but there is a little
place in Nottingham called Bonchurch...

01:13:07.228 --> 01:13:08.689
Much!

01:13:09.348 --> 01:13:11.020
Sorry, forget about it.

01:13:18.294 --> 01:13:19.559
He needs us.

01:13:27.864 --> 01:13:29.487
Marian!

01:13:36.757 --> 01:13:39.521
- Robin. Forgive me.
- I already have.

01:13:42.427 --> 01:13:45.547
Let's finish this now. After them!

01:14:03.793 --> 01:14:06.677
It's not too late, we can still get the
King. You two, over there.

01:14:06.712 --> 01:14:08.601
Gisborne with me.

01:14:23.387 --> 01:14:24.484
This is a trap.

01:14:25.587 --> 01:14:27.778
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:14:28.778 --> 01:14:30.617
- Where's the King?
- Went after the Sheriff.

01:14:30.652 --> 01:14:32.465
We need to get him
out of here now!

01:14:43.898 --> 01:14:45.076
Keep them pinned down.

01:14:45.494 --> 01:14:46.883
I'll go round the back.

01:14:49.598 --> 01:14:51.276
Quickly. You must get out of here.

01:14:51.918 --> 01:14:53.197
Leave them to me.

01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:05.575
This is not right. Split up.

01:15:21.398 --> 01:15:23.030
Come on.

01:15:45.825 --> 01:15:47.498
Long live the King!

01:15:48.746 --> 01:15:50.129
No.

01:16:08.456 --> 01:16:10.189
Bye-bye, Blondie.

01:16:13.085 --> 01:16:14.613
We meet again!

01:16:25.266 --> 01:16:27.077
Guy!

01:16:32.335 --> 01:16:33.800
Stop!

01:16:34.247 --> 01:16:36.646
- It's over, Guy!
- Get out of the way.

01:16:36.681 --> 01:16:38.697
All this time, I've
been fighting for England.

01:16:38.732 --> 01:16:41.160
You think I'm going
to let you kill England?

01:16:41.161 --> 01:16:44.950
- Marian, get out of the way!
- You'll have to kill me first.

01:16:44.985 --> 01:16:47.692
No, we're going to get out of this.

01:16:47.727 --> 01:16:49.179
I'm going to do this thing.

01:16:49.214 --> 01:16:53.190
And then I will have power beyond measure.
And we will be together.

01:16:55.744 --> 01:16:59.376
I would rather die than
be with you, Guy of Gisborne.

01:17:02.927 --> 01:17:05.579
I'm going to marry Robin Hood.

01:17:09.227 --> 01:17:11.020
I love Robin Hood.

01:17:16.230 --> 01:17:18.382
I love Robin Hood.

01:17:31.770 --> 01:17:33.569
Marian!

01:17:42.922 --> 01:17:44.876
No!

01:17:54.124 --> 01:17:56.279
Gisborne!

01:17:57.366 --> 01:17:59.689
It's not over, Hood!

01:18:02.128 --> 01:18:05.262
I will have England!

01:18:19.458 --> 01:18:21.147
The King? Where's the King?

01:18:21.182 --> 01:18:24.385
He's all right. Marian, he's
all right. You saved him.

01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:26.252
How's it looking down there?

01:18:27.141 --> 01:18:29.493
Am I beyond even Djaq's amazing talent?

01:18:29.528 --> 01:18:31.016
Hang on. We'll think of something.

01:18:31.051 --> 01:18:34.150
Well, can you at least get
this out of me. It hurts...

01:18:36.308 --> 01:18:39.854
Marian. Marian, we can't
take it out just yet.

01:18:39.889 --> 01:18:43.031
Why? Why?

01:18:48.007 --> 01:18:50.255
Will I die when it comes out?

01:18:58.425 --> 01:19:00.198
Then we haven't got much time, my darling.

01:19:00.233 --> 01:19:03.127
We have for ever, my love.

01:19:03.534 --> 01:19:07.847
I hope we have for ever in heaven
because we didn't have enough time on earth.

01:19:08.625 --> 01:19:10.344
Not nearly enough time.

01:19:11.041 --> 01:19:14.032
- We were busy.
- We were fighters and I am proud.

01:19:14.702 --> 01:19:18.974
- You keep fighting for me, Robin.
- I can't fight without you.

01:19:19.009 --> 01:19:22.274
I'd love to argue with you,
but we haven't got the time.

01:19:22.966 --> 01:19:25.934
You promise me, you keep fighting.

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:28.879
I will.

01:19:33.471 --> 01:19:34.970
Now, where were we?

01:19:35.866 --> 01:19:37.481
What?

01:19:37.953 --> 01:19:41.361
The last time we were dying,
we were getting married.

01:19:41.987 --> 01:19:43.714
Can we carry on, please?

01:19:44.409 --> 01:19:46.035
I can't remember.

01:19:46.762 --> 01:19:49.661
That's the last time I marry
you, if you can't remember!

01:19:49.696 --> 01:19:51.232
Robin.

01:20:02.858 --> 01:20:06.938
I, Robin, take you, Marian,
to be my wedded wife.

01:20:07.402 --> 01:20:09.442
To have and to hold,
from this day forward,

01:20:10.538 --> 01:20:15.100
for better, for worse,
for richer, for poorer,

01:20:16.029 --> 01:20:18.241
in sickness or in health,

01:20:18.903 --> 01:20:23.870
to love and to cherish,
'till death do us part.

01:20:25.294 --> 01:20:28.554
I, Marian, take you, Robin,

01:20:29.406 --> 01:20:34.175
beautiful, beautiful lord of Locksley,
to be my wedded husband.

01:20:35.303 --> 01:20:38.615
I promise to love you
and to cherish you,

01:20:38.882 --> 01:20:42.865
on earth and
especially in heaven...

01:20:45.617 --> 01:20:47.394
for now and forever.

01:20:47.881 --> 01:20:50.154
Till death do us part.

01:20:52.403 --> 01:20:54.243
Kiss me.

01:20:54.882 --> 01:20:56.314
No.

01:20:56.866 --> 01:20:59.115
Give me the ring first.

01:20:59.387 --> 01:21:01.980
Make an honest woman of me, Robin.

01:21:06.579 --> 01:21:09.541
You may kiss the bride.

01:21:12.944 --> 01:21:18.549
- I love you, my husband.
- I love you, my wife.

01:21:32.915 --> 01:21:35.371
That's better.

01:21:42.909 --> 01:21:45.221
Marian?

01:21:50.219 --> 01:21:52.172
Marian?

01:23:36.197 --> 01:23:37.981
You take care.

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:40.318
Robin.

01:23:45.952 --> 01:23:47.592
Will and I are...

01:23:50.617 --> 01:23:52.224
You're staying.

01:23:53.481 --> 01:23:55.419
Ma salama, Robin.

01:24:06.668 --> 01:24:10.620
- Come here. Look after her.
- Thank you.

01:24:21.196 --> 01:24:22.846
Robin.

01:24:42.343 --> 01:24:44.226
You've saved my life.

01:24:47.145 --> 01:24:48.640
Now go home and grieve your loss.

01:24:48.675 --> 01:24:53.814
Now, Your Majesty, for every man there
is a purpose which he sets up in his life.

01:24:55.911 --> 01:24:58.504
Let yours be the doing of all good deeds.

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:03.687
The Koran.

01:25:03.976 --> 01:25:05.791
Then do those deeds in my name.

01:25:06.096 --> 01:25:10.733
You are my representatives in England.
You are King Richard.

01:25:12.632 --> 01:25:14.344
- And you?
- Us?

01:25:14.799 --> 01:25:17.241
We are Robin Hood!

01:25:18.049 --> 01:25:19.250
Yes.

01:25:19.665 --> 01:25:22.631
- We are Robin Hood!
- We are Robin Hood!

01:25:24.634 --> 01:25:26.010
Come on, lads.

01:25:27.324 --> 01:25:29.556
Let's go home.

01:25:53.993 --> 01:25:59.974
