00:09.975 --> 00:13.524
-Morning, Roz.
- Niles called. He'll be over at seven.

00:13.854 --> 00:17.813
- Thanks. You seem awfully calm today.
- Why shouldn't I be?

00:18.150 --> 00:20.618
You're usually anxious in ratings week.

00:20.902 --> 00:23.780
- That starts today?
- I shouldn't have mentioned it.

00:24.072 --> 00:27.826
You do this every year. You convince
yourself we'll have no good callers,

00:28.160 --> 00:30.913
but our listeners always come through.

00:31.204 --> 00:33.195
You're on.

00:34.291 --> 00:36.600
Hello, Seattle.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.

00:36.877 --> 00:39.550
I was reminded this morning
of a jaunty aphorism

00:39.838 --> 00:42.636
that's credited
to the great thinker Spinoza.

00:42.924 --> 00:43.913
Oh, God!

00:45.260 --> 00:50.334
- What's your problem?
- <i>Hi. Well, I'm kind of indecisive.</i>

00:50.724 --> 00:53.716
Well, I'm not. Frasier Crane Show.

00:54.019 --> 00:56.931
<i>I want to change careers.
I feel trapped.</i>

00:57.230 --> 00:59.585
It's not a great problem,
but hold, please.

00:59.858 --> 01:02.213
Frasier Crane Show.
what's your problem?

01:02.486 --> 01:05.000
- <i>It's sort of embarrassing.</i>
- Amen.

01:06.323 --> 01:10.441
<i>I was a bed-wetter as a child and
I think the problem's coming back.</i>

01:10.786 --> 01:14.335
Great. Hold, please. Career change?
I got a bed-wetter holding.

01:14.665 --> 01:18.499
Are you trapped because you're
a woman trapped inside a man's body?

01:18.835 --> 01:21.713
- <i>I don't think so.</i>
- I can't get you on then.

01:22.005 --> 01:25.600
<i>I really wanted to talk to him.
I guess that could be part of it.</i>

01:25.926 --> 01:27.484
Good answer. Hold, please.

01:27.719 --> 01:31.075
Bed-wetter, I got a transsexual
in crisis. You've got to beat that.

01:31.390 --> 01:34.746
Ever wet a bed with anybody else in it?
A hooker, best friend's wife?

01:35.060 --> 01:36.049
<i>No.</i>

01:36.269 --> 01:40.182
- Do you want to talk to the doc or not?
- <i>OK. I guess the third one.</i>

01:40.524 --> 01:43.436
Hold, please.
Hey, transsexual.

01:43.735 --> 01:46.647
- <i>Is that me?</i>
- Yeah.

01:46.947 --> 01:50.064
Have you ever run for political office
or considered it?

01:50.367 --> 01:53.643
- <i>Like congressman?</i>
- Perfect.

01:53.954 --> 01:58.232
Don't get me started on rationalistic
pantheism or there go the three hours.

01:59.710 --> 02:03.988
I think it's time we went to the phones.
Roz, whom do we have?

02:04.339 --> 02:08.332
A bed-wetting adulterer, unless you'd
rather speak to Roger on line two

02:08.676 --> 02:11.908
who's a transsexual
running for Congress.

02:13.974 --> 02:16.647
Go ahead, Roger, I'm listening.

02:22.983 --> 02:25.656
Why did you chicken out like that?

02:25.944 --> 02:29.573
She's younger than I am.
She probably dates doctors and lawyers.

02:29.906 --> 02:34.457
- She wouldn't be interested in me.
- Who wouldn't be interested?

02:34.828 --> 02:38.298
A certain someone had the chance
to ask a certain someone else

02:38.623 --> 02:41.740
- from the building on a date.
- That would be Mrs Crowley.

02:44.046 --> 02:46.037
And bailed out again.

02:46.298 --> 02:50.450
The Crane men have not enjoyed success
in the romance department lately.

02:50.802 --> 02:53.157
We're all a bit gun-shy.

02:53.430 --> 02:57.025
Gun-shy, sensitive, picky.
You're all full of excuses.

02:57.351 --> 03:01.663
Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever get
you married off and out of this house.

03:04.399 --> 03:09.189
Hello? Why, Mrs Crowley,
we were just talking about you.

03:09.571 --> 03:11.562
Yes, he's here. Hold on.

03:19.081 --> 03:20.196
Hi.

03:20.415 --> 03:24.931
Really? No, I'm not busy.
Dinner sounds like fun.

03:25.295 --> 03:30.085
A certain someone is inviting
a certain someone else to dinner.

03:30.467 --> 03:32.458
Yes, and where would the world be

03:32.719 --> 03:35.995
without you Brits
and your knack for code-cracking?

03:38.558 --> 03:44.190
Sure, I'd love to. Thanks.
And thanks for asking me. Bye.

03:44.606 --> 03:47.564
She's invited me
to her place tomorrow night.

03:47.859 --> 03:51.135
Guess my little hard-to-get plan
really paid off.

03:51.446 --> 03:56.201
Yes, you should write a book.
"How to Get a Date in Two Easy Years".

03:58.453 --> 04:01.650
- Hello, Niles.
- Frasier. Dad. Hey, Daphne.

04:01.957 --> 04:03.993
- What have got there?
- Patient files.

04:04.251 --> 04:06.719
Frasier's helping me
with my couples' group.

04:07.004 --> 04:09.837
Your father's starting
a couples' group tomorrow.

04:10.132 --> 04:11.690
Mrs Crowley?

04:13.802 --> 04:17.680
It's ironic. Dad's doing better
in that department than either of of us.

04:18.015 --> 04:20.324
Not true.
That's what I wanted to tell you.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.239
Maris and l
are back on the expressway to love.

04:23.520 --> 04:26.671
Well, if not the expressway,
at least the on-ramp.

04:28.317 --> 04:31.275
I owe it all to the best psychiatrist
I have ever known.

04:31.570 --> 04:34.528
- That's very flattering.
- Dr Bernard Schenkman,

04:34.823 --> 04:37.178
our new marriage counsellor.
He's a wizard.

04:37.451 --> 04:41.239
Maris is thrilled with him. It's
as if he's discovered the magic elixir

04:41.580 --> 04:44.458
to repair the shattered fragments
of her psyche.

04:44.750 --> 04:48.709
- I don't know what to call it.
- The words "crazy glue" leap to mind.

04:51.465 --> 04:55.902
Doctor Schenkman's helped me, too.
He pinpointed my primary failing.

04:56.261 --> 04:58.729
- Which is?
- I'm too predictable.

04:59.014 --> 05:01.403
I don't know
if I'd count that as a failing.

05:01.683 --> 05:05.039
I do and so does Maris.
But I'm going to do something about it.

05:05.354 --> 05:08.869
In half an hour I'll show Maris
spontaneity beyond her dreams.

05:09.191 --> 05:11.386
But we're preparing for your workshop.

05:11.652 --> 05:14.120
You'll have to
look over the files yourself.

05:14.404 --> 05:17.123
Every Friday
Maris spends an hour meditating.

05:17.407 --> 05:20.717
Invariably
she comes back randy as a stoat.

05:21.953 --> 05:25.707
Tonight she'll find me
waiting in her bed as randy as

05:26.500 --> 05:28.730
another stoat.

05:32.547 --> 05:35.107
I wonder if that's a good idea.

05:35.384 --> 05:38.740
Frasier, I know you mean well
and I love you and respect you,

05:39.054 --> 05:41.693
but with your track record
in relationships,

05:41.974 --> 05:45.091
you're about the last person
who should be giving advice.

05:45.394 --> 05:46.793
Fair enough.

05:47.020 --> 05:50.854
And do look over the files.
Those couples really need our help.

07:00.344 --> 07:02.300
Hello, Maris.

08:35.147 --> 08:36.135
Maris?

08:43.405 --> 08:45.123
- Dr Schenkman.
- Niles.

08:45.365 --> 08:47.560
Dr Schenkman, what the hell's going on?

08:47.826 --> 08:50.898
It's not what it looks like.

08:51.204 --> 08:54.674
What am I saying? Bear with me.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.630
- I'm sorry. I'm feeling stressed.
- You're feeling stressed?

09:00.005 --> 09:03.998
- Put yourself in my place.
- I very nearly did.

09:06.595 --> 09:09.667
I'm stunned.
How long has this been going on?

09:09.973 --> 09:11.167
Two weeks.

09:11.391 --> 09:15.828
Maris and I were waiting to tell you
when I felt that you were ready.

09:16.188 --> 09:21.501
That's despicable. It's unethical.
It's... Are those my pyjamas?

09:21.902 --> 09:25.372
Could be.
They bind a little in the crotch.

09:25.697 --> 09:29.133
Listen, whatever anger you're feeling

09:29.451 --> 09:33.444
- can't begin to approach my guilt.
- Don't bet on it.

09:33.789 --> 09:36.986
That's good. Vent that rage.
You have every right to.

09:37.292 --> 09:40.841
You're sleeping with my wife and
giving me permission to be angry?

09:41.171 --> 09:42.843
Furious. Livid.

09:43.090 --> 09:45.399
You're dealing with it very well,
by the way.

09:45.676 --> 09:48.668
- Would you care...?
- You could lose your licence

09:48.971 --> 09:52.407
- for having an affair with a patient?
- And I deserve to,

09:52.724 --> 09:55.477
but it was a risk
worth taking because of love.

10:01.108 --> 10:03.178
I love her, Niles.

10:03.443 --> 10:06.640
I've never known a woman so warm,

10:06.947 --> 10:09.859
so nurturing, so unselfish.

10:14.663 --> 10:18.702
Is it possible this is
a case of mistaken identity?

10:19.042 --> 10:21.033
Thanks to our sessions,

10:21.294 --> 10:25.333
Maris has been unafraid to show me
the real woman inside.

10:25.674 --> 10:29.269
Damn you. I trusted you. Because
you were supposed to be helping us.

10:29.594 --> 10:31.903
And I liked you, too, you bastard.

10:32.180 --> 10:36.253
You betrayed my confidence and my
friendship and you seduced my wife.

10:36.601 --> 10:40.560
There's a lot of new issues here,
aren't there?

10:41.356 --> 10:44.871
Think maybe we should kick it
up to three sessions a week?

10:50.532 --> 10:52.568
- You are 20 minutes late.
- Sorry.

10:52.826 --> 10:57.775
Sorry? I've been making small talk
with them for 20 minutes.

10:58.165 --> 11:02.636
And for people who have a problem
communicating that's tiny talk.

11:03.962 --> 11:05.953
I have a lot on my mind right now

11:06.214 --> 11:10.651
so let's just begin and, you know what,
maybe you should take the lead. OK?

11:11.011 --> 11:13.161
Very well.

11:14.181 --> 11:17.253
Evening, all. Sorry I'm late. My fault.

11:17.559 --> 11:20.392
If I know these people,
they won't hold a grudge.

11:20.687 --> 11:23.997
I feel as though I do know
a great deal about this group.

11:24.316 --> 11:28.787
I've spent a good deal of time
pouring over your case histories.

11:30.197 --> 11:32.711
So, let's begin.

11:32.991 --> 11:36.461
Mrs Buddinger,
I see that you're here alone.

11:36.787 --> 11:39.540
- Yes.
- Is there a reason Dan's not here?

11:39.831 --> 11:45.349
No, he's just stubborn sometimes.
He says he doesn't trust psychiatrists.

11:54.429 --> 11:57.705
- Maybe he's got good reason not to.
- Excuse me?

11:58.016 --> 12:01.452
I see what your brother's doing here.
Sometimes we role play

12:01.770 --> 12:04.967
and I think he's just saying
what my husband might say.

12:05.273 --> 12:07.787
Sounds promising, Janice.

12:08.068 --> 12:11.344
How would you respond
to what your husband has just said?

12:14.616 --> 12:18.973
You know, Dan, I don't think that
it's psychiatrists that you mistrust.

12:19.329 --> 12:23.720
I think it's me.
Why are you so suspicious lately?

12:24.084 --> 12:26.075
I think you know very well.

12:32.926 --> 12:36.157
A couple of harmless flirtations
at parties?

12:36.471 --> 12:40.623
Did you ever stop to consider how
those flirtations might make me feel?

12:40.976 --> 12:44.366
He's empathising with the husband.
We call this empathising.

12:44.688 --> 12:48.476
Are you going to tell me
you've never looked at anyone else?

12:48.817 --> 12:51.490
Don't you dare bring her into this.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.999
She is clean and pure and decent.

12:56.283 --> 12:59.958
Sometimes empathising
involves a bit of dramatic licence.

13:00.287 --> 13:04.519
- At least I've always been faithful.
- I've always been faithful to you.

13:04.875 --> 13:08.948
I wanted to believe that more
than anything in the world but now...

13:11.256 --> 13:14.328
I don't see how I possibly can.

13:14.635 --> 13:17.866
He's one of the greatest empathisers
in the business.

13:18.180 --> 13:21.411
Now I just want to die!

13:24.978 --> 13:29.369
Perhaps now would be a good time
to take our 15-minute break.

13:29.733 --> 13:31.724
We've made quite a catharsis here.

13:31.985 --> 13:35.295
Traditionally it is the patients
who make the breakthroughs,

13:35.614 --> 13:37.605
but we mustn't be sticklers.

13:38.450 --> 13:39.724
All right, Janice.

13:39.951 --> 13:43.785
Dan and I have never cheated
on each other. You've got to believe me.

13:44.122 --> 13:48.912
I do. Remember, no one is here
to judge anyone else's behaviour.

13:49.294 --> 13:51.967
What the hell are you doing,
you lunatic?

13:52.255 --> 13:54.610
Maris is having an affair
with Schenkman.

13:56.760 --> 13:57.749
Schenkman?

13:59.638 --> 14:01.708
Why the contemptible bastard.

14:01.974 --> 14:04.886
He was waiting at the house
for her when I got there.

14:05.185 --> 14:09.258
I'm so sorry, Niles.
Is there anything I can do?

14:09.606 --> 14:12.882
I don't see how. They're in love.
They plan to get married.

14:13.193 --> 14:15.149
He told you that?

14:15.404 --> 14:18.237
And she confirmed it...
when she walked in,

14:18.532 --> 14:22.411
once she'd stopped shrieking
and we'd coaxed her down off the canopy.

14:24.746 --> 14:30.025
I'm just shocked. Things seemed to be
going so well with the two of you.

14:30.419 --> 14:32.410
That's what I thought.

14:37.718 --> 14:41.188
Maybe Maris' feelings
for Dr Schenkman aren't real.

14:41.513 --> 14:44.311
Maybe this is
simply a case of transference.

14:44.599 --> 14:47.830
Patients often believe
they're in love with their analysts.

14:48.145 --> 14:50.579
- It's very common.
- It's happened to me.

14:50.856 --> 14:52.972
Get out of town.

14:53.233 --> 14:58.512
- I bet that's what's going on here.
- They've never fallen in love with me.

14:58.905 --> 15:01.100
Maris is easily influenced.

15:01.366 --> 15:04.005
Not even that fat lady
who brought me fudge.

15:04.286 --> 15:06.516
I'd be a fool to let her go.

15:06.788 --> 15:09.348
Niles, you're just grasping at straws.

15:09.624 --> 15:12.297
I owe it to my marriage
to give it one more shot.

15:12.586 --> 15:15.703
- How? What more could you do?
- I can talk to her alone.

15:16.006 --> 15:18.725
Make her understand
what a mistake she's making.

15:19.009 --> 15:22.763
Let's bear one thing in mind. Sometimes
a marriage is just bad, doomed,

15:23.096 --> 15:26.008
and no amount of discussion
will save it.

15:30.479 --> 15:32.947
Well, then, shall we resume?

15:38.153 --> 15:43.785
No, Daphne, you have fun. I'll be fine.
Yeah. We'll see you tomorrow. OK.

15:44.201 --> 15:47.079
Dad? No, he's not even back
from his big date yet.

15:47.371 --> 15:49.931
Maybe I'll see him in the morning, too.

15:50.207 --> 15:51.196
All right.

15:53.502 --> 15:57.336
Yes, it is a very romantic story.
Yes, yes.

15:57.673 --> 15:59.709
OK, Daphne.

15:59.967 --> 16:02.720
Yes, they do make a very cute couple.

16:03.011 --> 16:04.126
Anyway...

16:05.681 --> 16:08.400
Right, Daphne, yes.

16:08.684 --> 16:11.198
I suppose
they do owe it all to you, don't they?

16:12.104 --> 16:14.174
There's the door. OK.

16:19.528 --> 16:22.520
Niles. I thought
you were talking with Maris.

16:22.823 --> 16:25.735
It's over. Let her marry Schenkman.

16:26.034 --> 16:28.025
They deserve each other.

16:28.286 --> 16:31.358
I'm sorry, Niles. What happened?

16:32.582 --> 16:36.052
I reached the front gate
and was just about to ring the doorbell

16:36.378 --> 16:39.654
to ask her to let me in
when it suddenly dawned on me

16:39.965 --> 16:43.924
how many hours I have spent
pleading with that woman through gates,

16:44.261 --> 16:47.333
through windows, through keyholes
and through transoms

16:47.639 --> 16:50.995
and, in one disastrous instance,
through the pet door.

16:53.270 --> 16:56.546
Yes, I remember dabbing Bactine
on those Chihuahua bites.

16:57.733 --> 17:00.122
Well, I decided no more.

17:00.402 --> 17:04.281
I actually looked up at the house
and said, "Goodbye, Maris."

17:06.282 --> 17:08.319
"l hope you have a happy life,

17:08.577 --> 17:11.296
but I don't have
to take any more of your crap".

17:11.579 --> 17:14.571
And I turned on my heel and walked away.

17:14.875 --> 17:18.185
That's a courageous decision.

17:18.502 --> 17:21.858
- How do you feel?
- Not bad, surprisingly.

17:22.174 --> 17:24.608
I'm glad I went over.
I needed the closure.

17:26.178 --> 17:31.411
Now that it's over, I feel a little sad,
of course, but also strangely liberated.

17:34.269 --> 17:36.260
I'm very proud of you.

17:41.777 --> 17:44.291
Dad, you're back.

17:44.571 --> 17:47.131
How did things go with Mrs Crowley?

17:47.407 --> 17:52.686
Great. Fabulous. Right up to the time
she introduced me to my date.

17:54.373 --> 17:56.523
- I thought she was your date.
- So did I.

17:56.792 --> 18:00.262
Turns out my date was her mother.

18:00.587 --> 18:05.900
86 years young. I guess there was
a miscommunication when she invited me.

18:06.301 --> 18:10.214
I'm almost afraid to ask this.
How was "Mom"?

18:12.641 --> 18:14.632
She was very nice.

18:14.893 --> 18:16.963
Sleepy.

18:18.605 --> 18:21.915
Showed me pictures
of her great-grandchildren.

18:22.234 --> 18:26.910
Couldn't remember any of their names.
She couldn't remember mine either.

18:27.280 --> 18:30.158
We could all use
a little something from the bar.

18:30.450 --> 18:32.645
I could use a big something.

18:32.911 --> 18:38.861
- It hasn't been a good day all around.
- Maris and I have split up for good.

18:39.293 --> 18:41.204
I'm sorry.

18:41.461 --> 18:45.090
- She's in love with someone else.
- Niles, are you all right?

18:45.424 --> 18:46.777
I will be.

18:47.009 --> 18:50.843
Well, this may come
as small consolation to you,

18:51.179 --> 18:56.378
but I believe that
you each have a lot of work to do

18:56.768 --> 19:00.204
to catch up to me
in the failed romance department.

19:00.522 --> 19:02.513
Divorced twice,

19:03.900 --> 19:06.095
left at the altar once.

19:13.702 --> 19:18.059
Well, I haven't exactly
been burning things up lately.

19:18.415 --> 19:19.768
Thank you, Dad.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.039
Things with Sherry fizzled,
then Sleeping Beauty tonight.

19:26.548 --> 19:29.142
I think maybe I deserve the booby prize.

19:33.013 --> 19:35.004
I'll challenge you.

19:36.475 --> 19:39.672
Fifteen years with Maris,
I end up in bed with her lover.

19:46.610 --> 19:48.999
I didn't need to hear that.

19:49.279 --> 19:53.352
No, it was an accident. It was
pitch dark. I thought he was Maris.

19:53.700 --> 19:57.534
It's a natural mistake.
What tipped you off?

19:57.871 --> 20:01.546
The heat from her side of the bed.

20:06.797 --> 20:10.506
Well, I think we have a three-way tie.

20:11.218 --> 20:14.767
Here's to the Crane boys,
love's big losers.

20:19.726 --> 20:24.561
I said I needed closure. I won't
have it until I do one more thing.

20:24.940 --> 20:27.818
Niles, from this height
that can hurt somebody.

20:28.944 --> 20:30.502
All clear.

20:31.905 --> 20:35.295
Goodbye, Maris.
You've hurt me for the last time.

20:35.617 --> 20:39.246
Niles, is that your Mercedes
parked down there?

20:42.290 --> 20:45.839
Good body shop
will be able to pound that out.

20:50.841 --> 20:52.957
Well, it's Saturday night.

20:54.261 --> 20:57.810
Here we are. Again.

20:58.765 --> 21:02.360
Wonder how many women are out there
tonight without a date.

21:02.686 --> 21:03.801
Thousands.

21:04.021 --> 21:08.378
Thousands of opportunities for us
to humiliate ourselves.

21:08.734 --> 21:13.489
Well, come and get us, Seattle.
Three Cranes, no waiting.

21:13.864 --> 21:15.855
We're desperate.

21:16.116 --> 21:18.835
- We're ludicrous.
- We're pathetic.
