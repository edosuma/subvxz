So, all the chiefs met
to see what they could do.

13:07.400 --> 13:08.470
The illness could only be stopped

13:08.600 --> 13:11.718
if the daughter of a chief
gave up her life for her people.

After a long debate, they knew
they couldn't ask for such a sacrifice.

And the princess, when she heard
about this prophecy,

13:21.000 --> 13:24.789
she knew what she had to do,
'cause she loved her people so much.

she climbed up to those rocks.

that his daughter was missing.

13:54.240 --> 13:56.471
He knew what she had done.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.677
His heart broke.

He cried out, asking for his daughter's
sacrifice to be remembered.

14:07.760 --> 14:12.551
The Great Spirit was so moved by his tears

14:12.640 --> 14:14.199

- I can't.
- Not on your own, you can't.

- No, Mack.

And she didn't deserve it.

He doesn't stop a lot of things
that cause him pain.

was the work of evil.

is immune from it.

can we ask you to do
something for us when you go?

01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:13.679
Anything.

01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:15.797
Kate needs you.

01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:19.237

01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:26.275

01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:35.114
When I go back...

01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:40.236
I still want you in my life.

01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:41.595

01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:43.239
I always am.

01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:45.789
I always will be.

01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:48.270
That's good.

01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:53.270

01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:56.439
I gotta talk to Kate.

hit by a 40-ton semi.

01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:16.556
Last night?

01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:20.793
No, Friday. Right after
you stole my truck.

Mack, you never made it.

01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:40.594
Yeah, I did. Yeah, I made it.

01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:44.880

to take in, all right?
