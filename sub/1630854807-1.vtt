WEBVTT

00:06.180 --> 00:08.617
Okay, everybody, everybody?
Um, quick heads-up.

00:08.617 --> 00:10.749
I presume some of you may have
heard some of these accusations

00:10.749 --> 00:12.838
that have been flying around
about defective pawls

00:12.838 --> 00:14.144
and a cover-up, et cetera.

00:14.144 --> 00:16.407
Well, if there is
an investigation,

00:16.407 --> 00:19.628
we may receive a "preservation
of evidence" order.

00:19.628 --> 00:23.066
That makes it illegal for you
to destroy any documents, okay?

00:23.066 --> 00:26.200
Second heads-up: we actually
haven't received one yet, okay?

00:26.200 --> 00:28.071
So, um, you know,
at this moment in time,

00:28.071 --> 00:32.075
the destruction of documents
is not presently a crime, so...

00:34.077 --> 00:35.513
Our stock's already down 20%.

00:35.513 --> 00:36.949
This is the worst day
of my life.

00:36.949 --> 00:38.777
Yeah, a lot of people
are hurting right now.

00:38.777 --> 00:40.431
Yeah, but I'm being hurt
the most, you know,

00:40.431 --> 00:42.912
'cause I own the most stock.
- Huge discovery this morning:

00:42.912 --> 00:45.306
McDonald's sells bagels.
- Hmm.

00:45.306 --> 00:46.481
How you guys holding up?

00:46.481 --> 00:48.091
I may have to get rid
of Rosalita.

00:48.091 --> 00:49.701
- Your housekeeper?
- What? No.

00:49.701 --> 00:52.008
Mayra's my housekeeper, and
sometimes her daughter helps.

00:52.008 --> 00:53.183
Rosalita's my catamaran.

00:53.183 --> 00:54.793
She's a 42-foot Crowther,

00:54.793 --> 00:57.100
and now I don't know
if I can afford to keep her.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.885
- Wow.
- Yes, not fair, exactly.

00:59.885 --> 01:01.148
If you have deleted

01:01.148 --> 01:02.975
any sensitive files
off your computer,

01:02.975 --> 01:05.804
don't worry: the authorities
will be able to retrieve them,

01:05.804 --> 01:07.850
you know, unless you happen
to run your hard drive

01:07.850 --> 01:09.939
through an industrial-grade
degausser...

01:09.939 --> 01:11.549
Like the one located

01:11.549 --> 01:13.377
in room 261
of the IT department.

01:13.377 --> 01:14.726
Now, some of you
may be wondering,

01:14.726 --> 01:16.902
"Elliot, what's
with the power drill?"

01:18.687 --> 01:20.906
<i>♪ Bom bom
bom-bom-bom-bom-bom ♪</i>

01:20.906 --> 01:23.866
<i>♪ Buh buh bom-bom-bom
buh bom-bom-bom-bom ♪</i>

01:26.695 --> 01:29.393
All right,
for the next couple of days,

01:29.393 --> 01:31.395
or as long
as this little crisis lasts,

01:31.395 --> 01:34.398
this is officially our...

01:34.398 --> 01:36.139
- Wah-room?
- What?

01:36.139 --> 01:38.141
No, war room.

01:38.141 --> 01:39.316
It does look like wah-room.

01:39.316 --> 01:40.535
- Yeah.
- You want me to rewrite it?

01:40.535 --> 01:41.536
Everyone knows what it says,
all right?

01:41.536 --> 01:42.754
Will you just put it up, please?

01:42.754 --> 01:43.886
You want me to take it
to the print shop?

01:43.886 --> 01:45.017
I can make it look
more professional.

01:45.017 --> 01:46.454
Eh, don't bother.

01:46.454 --> 01:47.716
By the time they finish,
this thing will all be over.

01:47.716 --> 01:49.152
Oh, everyone's
met Ian, right?

01:49.152 --> 01:50.936
He's the best crisis manager
out there.

01:50.936 --> 01:53.287
He got us through a lot
of thorny stuff at York,

01:53.287 --> 01:55.767
and he has also worked with--
- Eh, bah-bah-bah.

01:55.767 --> 01:57.291
We don't talk
about other clients,

01:57.291 --> 01:59.336
but let's just say
I am his top gun,

01:59.336 --> 02:03.210
and to make him seem normal
is a mission impossible.

02:03.210 --> 02:05.212
All right, so we are
in very good hands.

02:05.212 --> 02:06.430
All right, my SEO guys

02:06.430 --> 02:07.605
are working to choke
this story out.

02:07.605 --> 02:09.433
When you Google
"Payne scandal,"

02:09.433 --> 02:11.783
all you're gonna get
is 15 articles on Wesley

02:11.783 --> 02:13.568
going to a college
Halloween party

02:13.568 --> 02:14.873
dressed as Whoopi Goldberg.
- Oh...

02:14.873 --> 02:17.702
It wasn't Whoopi.
I was a Rasta guy.

02:17.702 --> 02:19.443
All right, where are we
with the bad pawls?

02:19.443 --> 02:21.097
- That's some good news.
- Mm.

02:21.097 --> 02:22.359
We stress-tested them,

02:22.359 --> 02:23.882
and even though they weren't
technically rated

02:23.882 --> 02:26.581
for the weight of the Hydra,
they were able to hold it.

02:26.581 --> 02:28.148
I went on the NHTSA database,
all right?

02:28.148 --> 02:29.714
Prior to the interview airing,

02:29.714 --> 02:31.629
the number of complaints about
Hydras rolling out of park

02:31.629 --> 02:33.501
was in line with any other car.
- Okay, score one.

02:33.501 --> 02:35.633
Just because nothing terrible
has happened yet

02:35.633 --> 02:37.069
doesn't mean it's not going to.

02:37.069 --> 02:38.636
I think we should still do
the recall, to be safe.

02:38.636 --> 02:40.334
I agree.
We should get ahead of this.

02:40.334 --> 02:42.988
Shocker--Jack and Sadie
are on the same side.

02:42.988 --> 02:44.468
It's like, "Have sex already."

02:44.468 --> 02:46.296
I mean,
you already did have sex,

02:46.296 --> 02:47.776
so it's like,
"Do it again already,"

02:47.776 --> 02:49.821
in front of us or something--
could you imagine?

02:49.821 --> 02:51.519
Here's my card
for when you need it.

02:51.519 --> 02:53.390
It's gonna look shady if I go
to the press and I say,

02:53.390 --> 02:54.739
"Oh, the pawls totally work.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.698
Oh, but, also,
we're doing a recall."

02:56.698 --> 02:58.830
Yeah, you shouldn't be
talking to the press at all.

02:58.830 --> 03:01.311
Anyone we throw out there
right now would be savaged.

03:01.311 --> 03:02.965
Oh, yeah,
like one of those videos

03:02.965 --> 03:06.316
where you see, like,
a bear tear a person apart.

03:06.316 --> 03:08.492
Uh, it's normally in Russia,
so don't worry.

03:08.492 --> 03:09.885
- Oh.
- All right, if somebody's

03:09.885 --> 03:11.800
gonna jump on the grenade,
it should be me.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.497
Great, 'cause I was gonna say
that I could do it, but--

03:13.497 --> 03:14.803
Fine.
Sadie'll talk to the press.

03:14.803 --> 03:16.021
You said you'd--

03:16.021 --> 03:17.153
Yeah, I'll do it.

03:17.153 --> 03:18.546
Love to. Happy to.
- Okay, perfect.

03:18.546 --> 03:19.938
I know this is stressful,

03:19.938 --> 03:22.506
but if there is one thing
that I know about myself,

03:22.506 --> 03:24.204
it is that I don't lose.
- Mm-hmm.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.509
We will get through this.

03:26.858 --> 03:29.513
Oh, [bleep].
Jesus, that's awful.

03:29.513 --> 03:31.211
Oh, it's just
how I imagined it.

03:33.778 --> 03:35.998
- Second breakfast?
- Third.

03:35.998 --> 03:37.478
I eat when I'm stressed.

03:37.478 --> 03:39.654
I was up all night Googling
corporate scandals.

03:39.654 --> 03:41.699
People go to jail.

03:41.699 --> 03:43.875
This isn't some giant
pyramid scheme, all right?

03:43.875 --> 03:46.095
We--we put a wonky part
in a few mid-range crossovers

03:46.095 --> 03:47.444
and got called out for it.

03:47.444 --> 03:49.011
So you're not worried
they'll need a fall guy

03:49.011 --> 03:50.360
and it could be one of us?

03:50.360 --> 03:51.883
Well, it's not gonna be me.

03:51.883 --> 03:53.668
Anytime I find myself
in a legally dubious situation,

03:53.668 --> 03:55.583
I write myself
a contemporaneous memo.

03:55.583 --> 03:58.281
So I have one dated from that
night saved on my computer

03:58.281 --> 04:00.283
saying that I advocated
for a recall.

04:00.283 --> 04:02.111
But you said
we shouldn't do a recall.

04:02.111 --> 04:04.374
Oh, Cyrus.

04:04.374 --> 04:06.724
That's not how my memo
remembers it.

04:06.724 --> 04:08.291
Ta-ta.

04:08.291 --> 04:09.901
Ugh. I hate this.

04:09.901 --> 04:11.642
Why'd you volunteer
if you didn't want to do it?

04:11.642 --> 04:13.644
I was trying to look good
in front of Katherine.

04:13.644 --> 04:15.777
I mean, it's like offering
to split the check on a date.

04:15.777 --> 04:17.605
You don't think they're gonna
take you up on that.

04:17.605 --> 04:19.520
Uh, I let the lady pay
for the whole thing.

04:19.520 --> 04:20.738
It shows that I'm worth it.

04:20.738 --> 04:22.610
Knock, knock.
Ready to face the mob?

04:22.610 --> 04:24.655
Yes, just going over
my statement here.

04:24.655 --> 04:27.832
Great.
Let me take a look here.

04:27.832 --> 04:29.312
No.

04:29.312 --> 04:31.271
Nope. Uh-uh.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.621
Huh-uh. Huh-uh.

04:33.621 --> 04:34.883
Uh-uh.

04:34.883 --> 04:35.710
All right.

04:35.710 --> 04:37.364
There you go. Godspeed.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.104
Ian, you kind of crossed out
a lot here.

04:39.104 --> 04:40.541
I'm sorry, Sadie.

04:40.541 --> 04:41.716
How many companies
have you saved from bankruptcy?

04:41.716 --> 04:43.718
Um, to my knowledge, zero.

04:43.718 --> 04:45.372
And I'm assuming most
of the press conferences you do

04:45.372 --> 04:46.590
are cutesy fun things,

04:46.590 --> 04:48.157
like factory openings,
charity events,

04:48.157 --> 04:49.985
where wheelchair kids
get to meet John Cena.

04:49.985 --> 04:51.769
We don't call them
"wheelchair kids."

04:51.769 --> 04:52.988
Fine, but you're
in my world now,

04:52.988 --> 04:53.945
where the more you say,

04:53.945 --> 04:55.120
the more they can attack.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.209
So you say nothing
and admit even less.

04:57.209 --> 04:58.341
Got it?

05:00.604 --> 05:02.780
We just call them kids.

05:02.780 --> 05:04.478
See, I wrote the memo
months ago.

05:04.478 --> 05:06.654
It was about how I wanted
to recall the Hydra,

05:06.654 --> 05:09.091
but for some reason,
it says I wrote it today,

05:09.091 --> 05:11.920
and I need it to say
I wrote it back then.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.835
So you want me

05:13.835 --> 05:16.359
to violate the fundamental
rules of space-time?

05:16.359 --> 05:18.579
That's a good one.

05:18.579 --> 05:19.928
No, I just need you

05:19.928 --> 05:22.974
to make it look
like it was written back then,

05:22.974 --> 05:25.455
contemporaneously.

05:25.455 --> 05:27.414
- Oh. Mm.
- Oh, uh-huh?

05:27.414 --> 05:28.632
- Got it.
- Mm-hmm.

05:28.632 --> 05:30.417
You want me
to alter the metadata

05:30.417 --> 05:31.809
to help you commit fraud.

05:31.809 --> 05:34.421
This has been fun, Chloe.
You're fun.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.640
You can go now.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.033
Sadie,
did Katherine Hastings know

05:38.033 --> 05:40.252
the cars contained
defective locking pawls?

05:40.252 --> 05:42.994
Well, Nate, that assumes
that the pawls were defective,

05:42.994 --> 05:44.431
which we're not saying.

05:44.431 --> 05:46.128
It also implies
that the Hydra's a car,

05:46.128 --> 05:49.044
when, actually
it's a light SUV, so...

05:49.044 --> 05:50.132
Andrea.

05:50.132 --> 05:51.394
Uh, yes, there are currently

05:51.394 --> 05:53.483
more than one million Hydras
on the road.

05:53.483 --> 05:54.832
Oof, according to you.

05:54.832 --> 05:57.008
No, according
to your website.

05:57.008 --> 05:58.619
Well, I don't make
the website.

05:58.619 --> 06:00.403
Or do I?

06:00.403 --> 06:02.710
No definitive answer on that.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.451
Excuse me.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.061
Are you hot?

06:06.061 --> 06:07.497
Mmm, mmm!

06:07.497 --> 06:09.369
I don't drink enough water...

06:09.369 --> 06:10.892
just in my--
sorry--day.

06:10.892 --> 06:12.807
How would you say
this is going?

06:12.807 --> 06:15.375
The flop sweats don't really
help her credibility.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.506
It's super unattractive.

06:16.506 --> 06:18.508
<i>Guys, there's no story here.</i>

06:18.508 --> 06:20.554
A story
is when something happens,

06:20.554 --> 06:23.600
and, literally,
nothing has happened.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.428
Man, it's beautiful
up here, huh?

06:25.428 --> 06:26.821
Look at that view.

06:28.562 --> 06:29.650
- The car's rolling!
- What?

06:29.650 --> 06:30.999
- The car's rolling!
- Oh, my God!

06:30.999 --> 06:32.392
It's gonna hit!

06:32.392 --> 06:34.524
Oh, my...
- Dad, make it stop!

06:34.524 --> 06:36.091
Boys, back up!
Back up!

06:36.091 --> 06:38.963
This whole thing is just--
it's all smoke and no fire.

06:40.661 --> 06:42.967
<i>In just a short time,
the Payne Wildfire</i>

06:42.967 --> 06:44.360
<i>has scorched
over 10,000 acres</i>

06:44.360 --> 06:46.231
<i>and remains zero percent contained.</i>

06:46.231 --> 06:47.798
Uh, hey, Cyrus,
what happened

06:47.798 --> 06:50.105
to "we stress-tested the pawls,
they can hold the Hydra"?

06:50.105 --> 06:52.150
They can if it was just
the weight of the car,

06:52.150 --> 06:53.413
but those people loaded it down

06:53.413 --> 06:55.371
with, like, 300 pounds
of camping gear.

06:55.371 --> 06:56.677
Great.
So we'll just warn people

06:56.677 --> 06:57.895
the Hydra's perfectly safe

06:57.895 --> 06:59.288
unless you put anything
into it,

06:59.288 --> 07:00.811
at which point it becomes
an absolute death trap.

07:00.811 --> 07:03.510
Elliot, why you scratching--
what's wrong with your face?

07:03.510 --> 07:05.903
- Ew, is that herpes?
- Uh-uh. How can it be herpes?

07:05.903 --> 07:07.122
He's not having sex
with anyone.

07:07.122 --> 07:08.428
Uh, okay, first of all,

07:08.428 --> 07:09.951
it absolutely could be herpes,
all right?

07:09.951 --> 07:11.343
I could have loads of herpes,

07:11.343 --> 07:12.562
but it is hives
from the stress.

07:12.562 --> 07:14.695
Okay, guys,
there is no need to stress.

07:14.695 --> 07:16.958
According to six different meteorologists,

07:16.958 --> 07:18.263
the wind is shifting.

07:18.263 --> 07:20.091
The fire's gonna burn out
in two days, max.

07:20.091 --> 07:21.397
What is done is done.

07:21.397 --> 07:22.964
All we can do now is figure out

07:22.964 --> 07:24.444
the best way to move forward.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.489
Ian, what do you advise?
- Off the top of my head:

07:26.489 --> 07:28.578
hire a PI, dig up some dirt
on the people in the video.

07:28.578 --> 07:31.799
Was the dad high? Was he drunk?
Was he even their dad?

07:31.799 --> 07:34.279
Because all I saw
was a grown man,

07:34.279 --> 07:37.500
potentially high, in the woods
with two boys, filming.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.284
This whole thing--
this is why we should've done

07:39.284 --> 07:40.590
a total recall
from the start.

07:40.590 --> 07:43.027
Oh, "Total Recall"--
"I'll be back."

07:43.027 --> 07:44.420
I'm with Jack.

07:44.420 --> 07:46.466
We've been saying
we should've done the recall

07:46.466 --> 07:47.771
from day one.

07:47.771 --> 07:50.382
You said we shouldn't do
the recall, Cyrus.

07:50.382 --> 07:53.124
Um, no, Jack, I definitely
was one of the people who said

07:53.124 --> 07:54.561
that we should do the recall.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.954
You said,
"We better not do it."

07:58.129 --> 08:00.088
We're gonna do
the recall now, okay?

08:00.088 --> 08:01.698
Let's do the recall now.

08:01.698 --> 08:03.526
Sadie, why don't you announce
it at the press conference?

08:03.526 --> 08:05.180
Oh, I-I'm going back
out there?

08:05.180 --> 08:07.530
I mean, Ian can jump in,
if you want.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.097
No. No, no.
No, I've got it.

08:09.097 --> 08:10.490
I loved--I loved it.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.535
And, honestly,
that was a no-win situation.

08:12.535 --> 08:14.842
That wouldn't have gone well
even if you'd done a good job.

08:14.842 --> 08:16.539
Yes, exactly.

08:16.539 --> 08:17.975
Hey, Katherine.

08:17.975 --> 08:20.021
Uh, so I know
I didn't do so great

08:20.021 --> 08:21.326
with the press the other day.
- Eh...

08:21.326 --> 08:22.850
Yeah, you got your butt
smacked a little,

08:22.850 --> 08:24.504
but, I mean, look, it happens
to the best of us--

08:24.504 --> 08:26.331
sometimes by choice, actually.

08:26.331 --> 08:27.855
Yeah, I just got in my head,

08:27.855 --> 08:29.334
but I really want to do
a good job for you out there,

08:29.334 --> 08:31.119
so, I mean,
if you've got any pointers...

08:31.119 --> 08:32.860
Just take charge up there.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.470
You're a strong woman.

08:34.470 --> 08:35.993
I am?

08:35.993 --> 08:37.081
I mean, I know that I am.

08:37.081 --> 08:38.692
I just--I didn't think
that you--

08:38.692 --> 08:40.737
Look, sometimes, sure, you
come off a little bit at first

08:40.737 --> 08:42.870
like, you know, one
of Cinderella's mice on speed.

08:42.870 --> 08:44.872
You know, like, "Oh, we can do
this, and we can do that,

08:44.872 --> 08:46.438
and...

08:46.438 --> 08:50.355
Right? But underneath that,
there is a wolf, okay?

08:50.355 --> 08:52.575
That's the scary bitch
I want you to be.

08:52.575 --> 08:55.578
Okay, want me to be, like,
a scary wolf bitch out there?

08:55.578 --> 08:56.753
Yeah, perfect.

08:56.753 --> 08:58.015
Do that, and you'll be great.
- Okay.

08:58.015 --> 08:59.626
Oh, and double up
on the antiperspirant.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.062
It was starting to look
like some kind of bad

09:01.062 --> 09:03.107
menopause drug commercial.

09:03.107 --> 09:04.587
Ah.

09:06.676 --> 09:07.721
God, okay.

09:07.721 --> 09:08.896
Mmm.

09:08.896 --> 09:11.072
You don't break
those up first?

09:11.072 --> 09:12.769
- What's the difference?
- It's just weird.

09:12.769 --> 09:14.771
I've never seen someone eat
a Kit Kat like that.

09:14.771 --> 09:16.207
I feel like

09:16.207 --> 09:18.035
I was just starting
to prove myself to Katherine,

09:18.035 --> 09:19.863
and then I fall apart
on live TV.

09:19.863 --> 09:22.039
I mean, I wasn't sweating
that much, though, was I?

09:22.039 --> 09:24.694
No, no more than your average
Southern 1920s country lawyer.

09:24.694 --> 09:26.827
We all react differently
to pressure.

09:26.827 --> 09:28.176
You sweat. I snack.

09:28.176 --> 09:30.395
Elliot... starts to rot.

09:30.395 --> 09:32.441
Yeah, and I can't stop
working out.

09:32.441 --> 09:34.356
It's like I'm trying
to run away from the guilt.

09:34.356 --> 09:36.619
I've already lost six pounds.

09:36.619 --> 09:38.839
You're a very annoying person
to be around.

09:38.839 --> 09:41.581
What I want to know is, how
is Katherine staying so calm?

09:41.581 --> 09:43.278
Like, we're all falling apart,

09:43.278 --> 09:45.628
and she's becoming
the best version of herself.

09:45.628 --> 09:47.195
Well, that's what being
a CEO is, you know.

09:47.195 --> 09:49.197
You need to be able to eat
pressure, let it nourish you.

09:49.197 --> 09:50.546
Just break it into pieces.

09:50.546 --> 09:52.722
- Why do you care?
- It's bothering me.

09:52.722 --> 09:53.941
Oh, don't.

09:53.941 --> 09:55.682
Don't you bite it.
Get--

09:55.682 --> 09:57.597
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my goodness.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.772
Oh, my God.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.251
Okay, I'll kill
the "Bloomberg" story.

10:00.251 --> 10:02.689
I have dirt on an editor there.
He's a sick pup.

10:02.689 --> 10:04.734
Katherine, Soren's office
has called twice.

10:04.734 --> 10:06.431
They want to set
an emergency meeting.

10:06.431 --> 10:08.085
- Soren?
- Chairman of the Board.

10:08.085 --> 10:09.478
They were already after my job.

10:09.478 --> 10:11.741
I doubt they're calling
to tell me that a scandal

10:11.741 --> 10:14.483
and a plummeting stock price
have made them reconsider.

10:14.483 --> 10:16.311
Look, my advice is,
push them off.

10:16.311 --> 10:18.618
Even if they are thinking
about replacing you,

10:18.618 --> 10:21.664
when you fix this crisis,
you'll show what you're worth.

10:21.664 --> 10:24.406
It's true. Every disaster
presents an opportunity.

10:24.406 --> 10:26.277
This fire
could be my Chernobyl.

10:26.277 --> 10:28.453
Uh, that one didn't go well,
though, right?

10:28.453 --> 10:29.846
- Yeah, but it could've.
- But it didn't.

10:29.846 --> 10:31.021
Yeah, but it will.

10:31.021 --> 10:33.110
Okay. All right.
Positive Chernobyl.

10:33.110 --> 10:35.243
Chernobyl.

10:35.243 --> 10:37.462
I keep refreshing
my news feed,

10:37.462 --> 10:39.290
waiting for them
to get this fire out.

10:39.290 --> 10:40.770
It's awful.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.772
Look, whatever happens,
you're gonna be taken care of.

10:42.772 --> 10:43.947
You're like family.

10:43.947 --> 10:46.471
Worst comes to worst,
come work for me.

10:46.471 --> 10:48.299
Work for you?
Doing what?

10:48.299 --> 10:49.649
I don't know.
You could be my...

10:49.649 --> 10:51.476
style guy/personal assistant.

10:51.476 --> 10:53.957
It'd be like "Entourage,"
where I'm the "star"

10:53.957 --> 10:56.133
and you're my best friend
who also works for me.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.439
We could be
double-teaming girls

10:57.439 --> 10:58.875
in my hot tub every night.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.485
Yeah, I don't remember
that happening on "Entourage."

11:00.485 --> 11:02.705
It did, offscreen.
But how awesome would that be?

11:02.705 --> 11:04.664
You'd be my Turtle.
- Yeah.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.491
Yeah, thanks.
I'll think about it.

11:06.491 --> 11:08.058
Would you rather be E?

11:08.058 --> 11:10.713
I just figured Turtle's
the closest one to a Black guy.

11:10.713 --> 11:12.367
Mm.

11:12.367 --> 11:13.890
- Sadie. Miss Ryan.
- Sadie, are you concerned

11:13.890 --> 11:15.936
that Payne will lose customers
over this?

11:15.936 --> 11:18.503
Uh, well, let's see, you've
lost most of your readers,

11:18.503 --> 11:20.070
and you're still in business.

11:20.070 --> 11:21.463
Tom.

11:21.463 --> 11:23.073
Do you accept responsibility
for the fire?

11:23.073 --> 11:27.121
Do you accept responsibility
for your weak chin?

11:27.121 --> 11:29.427
Wow, attacking a reporter's
physical appearance--

11:29.427 --> 11:30.690
not what I would've done.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.169
I mean, I told her
to be aggressive,

11:32.169 --> 11:33.693
but this is just catty.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.956
You know, and you're gonna
feel like an idiot, Tom,

11:35.956 --> 11:37.348
like an absolute moron

11:37.348 --> 11:39.089
because you and your
Chicken Little friends here,

11:39.089 --> 11:40.525
you're bitching and whining,

11:40.525 --> 11:42.527
when I guarantee that this fire

11:42.527 --> 11:45.835
will be out in two days, so f--

11:45.835 --> 11:47.054
That was one week ago,

11:47.054 --> 11:48.925
but the Payne Fire
continues to rage on,

11:48.925 --> 11:51.362
<i>now covering
over 100,000 acres</i>

11:51.362 --> 11:53.451
<i>and zero percent contained.</i>

11:55.149 --> 11:56.933
Smoke and ash
from the inferno is drifting

11:56.933 --> 11:57.934
across the country,

11:57.934 --> 11:59.675
reddening the skies over Payne,

11:59.675 --> 12:01.111
as we continue wondering,

12:01.111 --> 12:03.548
what did they know,
and when did they know it?

12:03.548 --> 12:06.116
Welp, who would've thought
the weather geeks had

12:06.116 --> 12:08.858
no [bleep] damn clue
what they were talking about?

12:11.078 --> 12:13.602
But, you know, there's always
black swan events

12:13.602 --> 12:15.604
that you can't predict, right?
- Uh, more bad news:

12:15.604 --> 12:18.041
my PI couldn't dig up any dirt
on that family.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.869
Apparently they were his kids,

12:19.869 --> 12:21.871
and no one
was molesting anyone.

12:21.871 --> 12:23.612
Gosh, you really
cannot win them all.

12:23.612 --> 12:26.223
Also, our share price
stumbled another 12%,

12:26.223 --> 12:29.357
and Biden called us "a blight
on our national honor."

12:29.357 --> 12:31.751
Wow.
Little harsh there, Joe, right?

12:31.751 --> 12:33.796
All right,
onward and upward, right?

12:33.796 --> 12:35.885
Thanks, guys.
- Okay, yeah, back at it.

12:35.885 --> 12:37.757
Yeah.

12:39.106 --> 12:40.803
How are you doing
with all this?

12:40.803 --> 12:42.413
I know you're dealing
with a lot.

12:42.413 --> 12:43.588
- Me?
- Yeah.

12:43.588 --> 12:45.416
Yeah, I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.201
If you ever want to talk
about it,

12:47.201 --> 12:48.637
you know,
just as, like, friends...

12:48.637 --> 12:50.117
I know we're not
friends, technically.

12:50.117 --> 12:52.206
I don't want to overstep,
but we could be more--

12:52.206 --> 12:53.816
Don't have to put
a label on it.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.470
Look what came
for the conference room.

12:55.470 --> 12:57.646
Oh, see, things
are looking up already.

12:57.646 --> 13:00.910
I still see wah-room.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.782
<i>Uh, hey, guys?</i>

13:02.782 --> 13:04.784
Uh, some of our internal emails

13:04.784 --> 13:07.134
have been leaking to the press,
and it really sounds

13:07.134 --> 13:08.831
like we're running around
with our hair on fire.

13:08.831 --> 13:10.267
It's embarrassing.

13:10.267 --> 13:12.443
So maybe please stop using
the terms like, uh,

13:12.443 --> 13:15.272
"disaster," "clunker,"
"dumpster fire,"

13:15.272 --> 13:18.362
"bloodbath," "death wagon,"
"Satan's wet dream,"

13:18.362 --> 13:20.103
and, of course, "[bleep] show,"
"[bleep] sandwich,"

13:20.103 --> 13:22.105
"[bleep]storm,"
and "[bleep] fire."

13:22.105 --> 13:24.412
Uh, what's a [bleep] fire?

13:24.412 --> 13:26.762
I can only assume it's a fire
made of [bleep]--I don't know.

13:26.762 --> 13:27.937
Checks out.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.852
<i>I am not a bad person.</i>

13:29.852 --> 13:31.245
I don't want things to burn.

13:31.245 --> 13:32.899
Is that what you guys think,

13:32.899 --> 13:34.857
that, like,
I'm on the fire's side,

13:34.857 --> 13:37.555
that I'm some mean fire lady?

13:37.555 --> 13:40.036
This is hard.

13:40.036 --> 13:43.518
Do you know how hard this
has been for-- like, for me?

13:43.518 --> 13:46.651
And not that--
It's not about me. I...

13:46.651 --> 13:48.958
I'm just--next question.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.786
<i>Oh, God.</i>

13:50.786 --> 13:52.570
Thank you. You have no idea
how good that feels.

13:52.570 --> 13:54.790
That is making me
physically ill.

13:54.790 --> 13:56.836
Oh, right, yes, it's
my dermatological condition

13:56.836 --> 13:58.446
that's making you feel sick and
not the fact that you're eating

13:58.446 --> 13:59.839
cake topped with butter.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.188
It's not cake.
It's a muffin.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.450
A chocolate muffin is cake.

14:02.450 --> 14:04.191
It just has a little jacket
around it.

14:04.191 --> 14:06.149
How the hell
does she remain so calm?

14:06.149 --> 14:07.542
She the one
with the job in jeopardy.

14:07.542 --> 14:09.326
Meanwhile,
we the ones falling apart.

14:09.326 --> 14:11.502
<i>- Okay...</i>
- Nothing gets to her.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.200
You look
like you're doing okay.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.942
I'm not. I haven't pooped
once since all this started.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.900
It's been over a month.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.902
I don't know where it goes.

14:19.902 --> 14:23.210
I guess it just, like...
evaporates or something.

14:23.210 --> 14:25.212
<i>What day is it?</i>

14:25.212 --> 14:26.909
- Wednesday.
- Yeah.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.693
No.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.608
Friday?
- Mm.

14:30.608 --> 14:33.350
I can't do
any more press conferences.

14:33.350 --> 14:35.918
I feel like I'm in one
of those movies

14:35.918 --> 14:38.225
where you replay the same day
on a loop,

14:38.225 --> 14:40.053
but somehow
I'm learning less each time.

14:40.053 --> 14:42.142
It's been pretty rough.

14:42.142 --> 14:44.231
Don't laugh.
It's...

14:44.231 --> 14:47.364
You try embarrassing yourself
on national TV.

14:47.364 --> 14:50.715
Uh, you mean like that time
I was on a news program

14:50.715 --> 14:53.370
and I talked about
how into a coworker I was?

14:53.370 --> 14:56.069
To which she replied...

14:56.069 --> 14:58.071
- That's not what I did.
- Uh, it's pretty close.

14:58.071 --> 14:59.289
- That's not what I did.
- It's pretty close.

14:59.289 --> 15:01.030
You know my friends
still make fun of me

15:01.030 --> 15:02.249
for getting denied
in prime time?

15:02.249 --> 15:05.121
- I wasn't denying you.
- I'm joking.

15:05.121 --> 15:07.210
No, but I'm just saying,
it wasn't, like, personal.

15:07.210 --> 15:08.603
- Hmm.
- You know, if we didn't work

15:08.603 --> 15:11.388
15 feet from each other,
then who knows?

15:11.388 --> 15:13.390
So, if Payne
goes out of business

15:13.390 --> 15:15.218
and we all go to prison, then...

15:15.218 --> 15:17.220
Just give me a call
when you get out.

15:17.220 --> 15:19.179
That's something
to look forward to.

15:19.179 --> 15:21.398
Night.
- Night.

15:25.054 --> 15:27.361
<i>Hundreds of exhausted firefighters</i>

15:27.361 --> 15:29.754
<i>are working into the night
battling the Payne Fire,</i>

15:29.754 --> 15:31.104
<i>which is now the largest
in the history of the state.</i>

15:31.104 --> 15:32.366
Wait. Stop.
Is--is that us?

15:32.366 --> 15:34.237
No, that's some fat guy.

15:34.237 --> 15:36.413
<i>... have been forced
to abandon their homes.</i>

15:36.413 --> 15:39.068
Oh, my God, I'm the fat guy.

15:39.068 --> 15:40.940
Okay, guys,
let's stay on task.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.245
Sadie...
- Mm.

15:42.245 --> 15:43.420
How close are they
to putting out the fires?

15:43.420 --> 15:45.205
Last I heard,
they're 2% contained,

15:45.205 --> 15:49.861
but, you know, 2%
of 300,000 acres--that's a lot.

15:49.861 --> 15:51.211
Yes, I like that optimism.

15:51.211 --> 15:53.953
Okay, where are we
with regulatory, Elephant Man?

15:53.953 --> 15:56.303
Uh, yeah, um,
fat stack of fines

15:56.303 --> 15:58.174
and a congressional
investigation, I think.

15:58.174 --> 15:59.915
Our stock's already
at an all-time low.

15:59.915 --> 16:01.351
I had to sell my boat.

16:01.351 --> 16:03.049
Now I'm a guy
with just one boat,

16:03.049 --> 16:04.441
like a frickin' cuck.

16:04.441 --> 16:06.487
How about the recall,
Professor Klump?

16:06.487 --> 16:09.533
Yeah, um, the recall is going
slower than expected,

16:09.533 --> 16:12.406
and, also, it's more expensive
than we expected.

16:12.406 --> 16:13.973
- Oh, my God.
- Oh.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.236
Guys, come on,
it's not that bad, right?

16:16.236 --> 16:17.454
I mean, Ian,
I'm sure you've dealt

16:17.454 --> 16:18.934
with way worse situations
than this.

16:18.934 --> 16:21.023
Uh, no.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.329
Mm.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.680
Okay, well, uh,

16:25.680 --> 16:27.508
I guess tomorrow morning,
we will reconvene.

16:27.508 --> 16:29.292
Uh, you got a meeting
with Soren in the morning.

16:29.292 --> 16:31.642
I couldn't put him off anymore.
He's coming in person.

16:31.642 --> 16:32.992
Ah.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.255
Wow, he's, uh, flying in
for the meeting.

16:35.255 --> 16:36.604
Oh.

16:36.604 --> 16:38.171
Must be important.

16:38.171 --> 16:39.999
Well, he probably doesn't
want to fire you over Zoom.

16:41.391 --> 16:43.524
Okay, like I'm the only one
in here thinking it.

16:43.524 --> 16:45.569
Maybe--maybe he just wants
to see the frogs.

16:45.569 --> 16:47.484
- What frogs?
- You haven't been outside?

16:47.484 --> 16:49.095
There's all these frogs
from the Detroit River

16:49.095 --> 16:50.313
trying to get away
from the smoke.

16:50.313 --> 16:51.706
Yeah, they're everywhere.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.969
They got into my kitchen,
just ribbiting all night.

16:59.366 --> 17:01.585
Wait.
I'm sorry, did you say "frogs"?

17:01.585 --> 17:03.631
- What--what's so funny?
- I mean, it's funny.

17:05.937 --> 17:07.287
These frogs?

17:07.287 --> 17:08.505
Every time, I think to myself,

17:08.505 --> 17:10.333
"This is as bad
as it can get," right?

17:10.333 --> 17:12.553
And then, nope, frogs.

17:15.338 --> 17:17.384
It's biblical, you know?

17:18.950 --> 17:21.953
I mean, there's fires,
darkness, a guy with boils.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.868
T-they're hives.

17:23.868 --> 17:25.348
And now frogs!

17:25.348 --> 17:27.263
Ooh, and my boat--that
could be, like, a Noah thing.

17:27.263 --> 17:30.614
It's--it's gonna be okay.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.399
No, no, no,
it's not gonna be okay, okay?

17:32.399 --> 17:35.358
We all know
it's not gonna be okay.

17:35.358 --> 17:37.230
I mean, I tell you guys
it's gonna be okay.

17:37.230 --> 17:39.971
And you know why?
- 'C--'cause you don't lose?

17:39.971 --> 17:41.538
No, I tell you
it's gonna be okay

17:41.538 --> 17:44.193
so that you all
don't panic, okay?

17:44.193 --> 17:46.543
I mean, outside,
I'm all like,

17:46.543 --> 17:49.111
"Hey, guys, everything's
gonna be just fine.

17:49.111 --> 17:51.113
Brighter days tomorrow.
Cheer up, okay?"

17:51.113 --> 17:52.723
Do you want to know
what I'm thinking inside?

17:52.723 --> 17:55.552
Would you like to know
what I am thinking inside?

17:55.552 --> 17:56.597
Yeah, yeah.

17:56.597 --> 17:58.120
!

17:58.120 --> 18:01.384
We're [bleep]!

18:01.384 --> 18:04.996
We're all [bleep]!

18:04.996 --> 18:07.521
All of us are [bleep]!

18:07.521 --> 18:09.305
All right!

18:09.305 --> 18:11.438
Well, I'd say
I'd see you tomorrow,

18:11.438 --> 18:13.135
but my money's on an asteroid
destroying the planet

18:13.135 --> 18:14.180
by morning.

18:20.011 --> 18:24.146
You're a nation of inbreds!
That's why you lost the war!

18:32.459 --> 18:33.982
Hey.

18:33.982 --> 18:36.115
You meet with Soren yet?
- Not yet.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.900
But I got the heads-up
this morning: I'm out.

18:38.900 --> 18:41.250
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Please don't be.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.599
It is fine.

18:42.599 --> 18:43.992
I mean, my lawyer says

18:43.992 --> 18:45.515
that my early-termination
penalties are so broad,

18:45.515 --> 18:47.169
they're gonna end up paying me
more than I would've made

18:47.169 --> 18:48.736
in five years
of actually working here, so...

18:48.736 --> 18:50.172
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.043
Jeez, I got to check
my contract.

18:52.043 --> 18:55.830
Yeah, I think I am due
for some well-earned self-care.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.962
Spend some time with Richard...
- Yeah.

18:57.962 --> 18:59.834
You know, read, travel,

18:59.834 --> 19:02.489
drink Bellinis on the beach
at dawn.

19:02.489 --> 19:04.143
I'm happy for you.

19:05.883 --> 19:07.146
- Thank you.
- Oh.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.625
Thank you for everything.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.758
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.

19:12.499 --> 19:13.935
And you're welcome, too.

19:13.935 --> 19:15.502
Yes, right,
thank you for everything.

19:15.502 --> 19:16.851
Absolutely are welcome.

19:16.851 --> 19:18.026
Was it one of those little,

19:18.026 --> 19:19.897
polite "thanks, sweetie"
type hugs?

19:19.897 --> 19:22.639
No, it was like
an actual, genuine embrace.

19:22.639 --> 19:23.858
How did she feel?

19:23.858 --> 19:25.033
I feel like she'd feel cold,

19:25.033 --> 19:26.687
like hugging Elsa
from "Frozen."

19:26.687 --> 19:28.123
No, just normal.

19:28.123 --> 19:30.865
She was happy. I think this
is a good thing for her.

19:30.865 --> 19:33.128
Oh, it's the end of an era,
you know?

19:33.128 --> 19:35.609
Not a very long one, but, uh--
but an era nonetheless.

19:35.609 --> 19:37.785
- Yo.
- Mm?

19:37.785 --> 19:39.221
I just had
a telehealth visit,

19:39.221 --> 19:41.789
and doctor said
if I don't poop soon,

19:41.789 --> 19:45.184
they're gonna have to medically
induce the poop out of me.

19:48.317 --> 19:52.539
We, uh, added a little bonus
for bowing out graciously.

19:52.539 --> 19:54.236
It's more than generous.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.369
Well, I'm sorry
about all this.

19:56.369 --> 19:59.198
There's just a lot
of very angry shareholders,

19:59.198 --> 20:01.983
so a few heads have to roll.

20:01.983 --> 20:03.332
A few heads?

20:03.332 --> 20:04.768
I knew about my head.

20:04.768 --> 20:06.988
I didn't realize
that there would be other...

20:06.988 --> 20:09.512
Any specific heads
or just any old head?

20:09.512 --> 20:12.646
Not many, just, you know,
whoever knew about the pawls.

20:12.646 --> 20:14.909
Yeah, um, Cyrus Knight,

20:14.909 --> 20:17.085
Elliot Chisholm, Sadie Ryan,

20:17.085 --> 20:18.913
a few others.
- Okay.

20:18.913 --> 20:20.567
Anyway,
thanks for everything,

20:20.567 --> 20:22.264
and we wish you luck.

20:26.616 --> 20:28.923
Give us six months.

20:28.923 --> 20:30.577
- I'm sorry?
- Yeah, six months.

20:30.577 --> 20:31.795
Let me keep my team.

20:31.795 --> 20:33.144
If--if we can't get
the stock price

20:33.144 --> 20:35.059
back to where it was
before all this happened,

20:35.059 --> 20:38.367
then I will walk, and you
don't have to pay me a dime.

20:38.367 --> 20:39.716
Hang on.

20:39.716 --> 20:41.109
Best-case scenario--

20:41.109 --> 20:43.329
you work your ass off
to make less

20:43.329 --> 20:45.461
than what you already have
on the table in front of you,

20:45.461 --> 20:47.376
or you lose everything.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.641
Oh. Hey.

20:51.641 --> 20:54.035
- Hey.
- Hey, there she is.

20:54.035 --> 20:55.819
- Come here, you.
- No.

20:55.819 --> 20:58.126
- Oh.
- I'm gonna be sticking around.

20:58.126 --> 20:59.780
- Hey.
- I sweet-talked them.

20:59.780 --> 21:01.172
- Wow!
- That's great.

21:01.172 --> 21:03.218
What happened to self-care?

21:03.218 --> 21:06.482
Let's just say I cared more
about something else.

21:06.482 --> 21:08.397
- Huh.
- Hmm.

21:08.397 --> 21:11.008
Basically, they were gonna
fire all you guys,

21:11.008 --> 21:12.706
and I threw myself on a grenade
to save your jobs.

21:12.706 --> 21:16.275
It was very heroic, and you all
owe me big-time, so...

21:16.275 --> 21:17.885
Uh...

21:17.885 --> 21:19.278
Huh.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.410
I am not gonna forget it.
