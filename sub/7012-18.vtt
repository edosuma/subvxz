00:04.200 --> 00:06.680
Hey, you guys! Great news!

00:06.760 --> 00:09.000
I was walking around
Halverson's Department Store...

00:09.080 --> 00:12.360
and the owner comes right up to me,
and he offered me a modeling job.

00:12.440 --> 00:14.280
Yeah. Whoo!

00:16.600 --> 00:21.360
Wait, wait.
He just offered you a modeling job?

00:21.400 --> 00:23.320
Yeah, sounds
a little suspicious.

00:23.400 --> 00:25.440
I mean, how do you know
it was the owner?

00:25.520 --> 00:28.560
Because it was
Mr. Halverson.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.960
How do you know
it was Mr. Halverson?

00:31.000 --> 00:34.800
Because I said,
"Aren't you Mr. Halverson?"

00:34.840 --> 00:37.720
And he said, "Yeah."

00:37.800 --> 00:42.160
- Hey, Hyde, aren't you Mr. Halverson?
- Yeah.

00:42.200 --> 00:47.200
See? Look, Michael. I've been in
that store over a hundred times...

00:47.280 --> 00:50.480
and Mr. Halverson never asked me
to be a model.

00:50.520 --> 00:53.080
And if Mr. Halverson never
asked <i>me</i> to be a model...

00:53.160 --> 00:55.280
then there's
no Mr. Halverson.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.200
It's a scam.

00:57.240 --> 00:59.160
I don't know.
It doesn't sound like a scam to me.

00:59.200 --> 01:02.840
- Thank you, Donna.
- Sounds like Mr. Halverson wants you for his lover.

01:04.840 --> 01:06.720
Either way,
I'm flattered.

01:08.800 --> 01:11.120
Hyde, will you teach me
how to drive the El Camino?

01:11.160 --> 01:13.800
Rhonda's car is a stick
and until I learn to drive it...

01:13.880 --> 01:17.000
I have to sit
in the lady seat.

01:17.080 --> 01:19.040
No way, man.
The Camino's cherry.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.800
- Please?
- No.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.960
Please, please, please?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.240
No.

01:25.320 --> 01:28.440
Please, please, please,
please, please, please...

01:28.520 --> 01:32.760
please, please, please, please, please,
please, please, please, please.

01:32.800 --> 01:37.240
Please, please, please, please, please,
please, please, please, please...

01:37.320 --> 01:40.120
please, please, please,
please, please, please...

01:40.160 --> 01:43.800
- please, please, please, please, please, please, pl...
- All right! All right!

01:45.000 --> 01:47.320
You can use the El Camino.

01:47.360 --> 01:49.240
But you have to
be careful, all right?

01:49.280 --> 01:51.640
I don't want anything
to happen to my baby.

01:51.720 --> 01:54.640
Aw, thanks for your concern,
Hyde, but I'll be fine.

01:56.920 --> 01:59.200
And let out the clutch
gently, okay?

01:59.280 --> 02:01.200
- 'Cause this car's very powerful.
- Hyde!

02:01.240 --> 02:04.240
We've been sitting here
for half an hour.

02:04.280 --> 02:07.160
Will you just shut your hole
and let me drive?

02:07.200 --> 02:10.680
Okay, you're clear.

02:15.280 --> 02:17.680
In front of you.

02:21.840 --> 02:25.760
Man, I picked a bad place
to take a nap.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.074

03:01.920 --> 03:04.760
Hey, Todd, I'm gonna
take my break now.

03:04.800 --> 03:07.760
- Michael's stopping by.
- Still dating that guy?

03:07.840 --> 03:11.840
I guess that's fine
if you like the handsome type.

03:11.920 --> 03:14.680
But does he have a picture of himself
with the guy who played Chewbacca?

03:14.720 --> 03:16.600
'Cause I do.

03:17.720 --> 03:21.000
Hey, Jackie!
More great modeling news.

03:21.080 --> 03:23.800
They're startin' me in underwear.

03:23.880 --> 03:27.320
Look, I got a W-4
and a body-waxing kit and everything.

03:28.760 --> 03:31.640
Oh. So you're really
an underwear model?

03:31.680 --> 03:34.960
No, not just underwear... briefs.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.560
I mean, usually, you have to spend
a year cutting your teeth in boxers...

03:37.640 --> 03:41.160
before you even get
into the tight stuff.

03:41.240 --> 03:44.600
You know what?
I don't have time for this right now.

03:44.680 --> 03:46.520
It just isn't important.

03:47.960 --> 03:50.480
- But, Jackie...
- Hey, maybe you didn't hear the lady.

03:50.560 --> 03:54.040
She's busy.
So hit the road, guy.

03:54.120 --> 03:57.920
I'm her boyfriend, <i>guy.</i>

03:58.000 --> 04:00.280
Nuh-uh.
When she works here...

04:00.320 --> 04:04.680
her boyfriend is every man, woman
and child that walks in here for cheese.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.920
Well, I don't have
any money for cheese.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.360
But I'm going to go get some,
and then we'll see whose boyfriend is whose.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.520
Let me tell you
something, Jackie.

04:22.600 --> 04:26.360
As a roving associate junior manager
for Cheese Palace, Incorporated...

04:26.440 --> 04:29.160
I've seen
a lot of things...

04:29.240 --> 04:31.760
some I can't talk about.

04:31.840 --> 04:34.120
But I will
tell you two things.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.920
One: With the German population
that this town has...

04:37.000 --> 04:41.120
we should be moving
a lot more sausage.

04:41.200 --> 04:45.360
Two:
You're a stone-cold fox.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.280
I've said too much.
I'll be in the cooler.

04:50.720 --> 04:54.840
Now, if your gown
falls open again...

04:54.920 --> 04:58.280
there's no need
to ring the little buzzer.

04:58.360 --> 05:00.920
You can just cover up
by yourself.

05:04.720 --> 05:08.080
Okay, um, I'll be right back
with your "blankie."

05:08.160 --> 05:12.440
"Thankie."

05:14.240 --> 05:16.880
Leo, I'm so sorry
I hurt you.

05:16.960 --> 05:20.080
Ah, that's all right, man.
I'll be fine.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.800
Least I still got it
all up here.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.680
But that's
just good genes, man.

05:26.720 --> 05:29.200
My father had
a good hairline too.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.400
Well, nice job, Fez.

05:32.440 --> 05:36.080
The fender's dented, the taillight's shot,
so you owe me 80 bucks.

05:38.920 --> 05:42.120
Okay, good luck with that.

05:44.840 --> 05:48.240
- I'm broke.
- Well, like my mom used to tell me...

05:48.280 --> 05:50.160
"Shut up and give me
some money."

05:51.480 --> 05:53.560
Hey, you guys,
I was just next door...

05:53.640 --> 05:56.600
and you know that weird kid from school
who's always saying he can fly?

05:56.680 --> 05:59.440
Yeah, he can't.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.440
So, Leo,
how's the hospital?

06:04.520 --> 06:06.640
Oh, it's great, man.

06:06.720 --> 06:09.600
Cable TV, free parking...

06:09.680 --> 06:13.080
don't have to get out of bed
to take a pee.

06:13.160 --> 06:15.560
It's just like a hotel.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.040
And Nurse Kitty and I
have had some good times.

06:51.720 --> 06:55.120
<i>Okay, Leo,</i>
<i>I'm going to get you a surprise dessert.</i>

06:55.160 --> 06:57.960
It jiggles...

06:58.040 --> 07:01.880
and it rhymes
with "jerry chello."

07:06.000 --> 07:08.560
I love you too, Kitty.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.480
I love you too.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.240
Hey, Eric,
um, where's Donna?

07:31.320 --> 07:33.160
Oh, she's out
with Kelso's brother.

07:33.240 --> 07:37.000
Which means it's only a matter of time
before she calls us from the holding cell.

07:38.040 --> 07:41.000
Well, I need
a woman's opinion.

07:41.080 --> 07:45.080
Eh, you're close enough.
Look.

07:45.160 --> 07:48.320
I'm just really upset
about Michael modeling.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.440
I mean, that was
our dream... together.

07:51.480 --> 07:53.400
But for me!

08:24.280 --> 08:26.640
Wait, so, um,
in your dream...

08:26.680 --> 08:30.880
you're a model,
and Kelso's, um, not there.

08:32.600 --> 08:35.120
Whereas in real life,
Kelso's a model...

08:35.159 --> 08:38.280
and you, um, sell cheese.

08:40.600 --> 08:43.600
That is... delightful.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.360
Hey, Red.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.280
Could you give these
to your wife, please?

08:57.240 --> 09:00.000
And tell her I love her.

09:01.880 --> 09:03.800
I'll give her the message.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.720
Thank you.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.880
Oh, boy!

09:09.960 --> 09:12.880
You got a date
for the Stoners' Ball.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.720
"Roses are red.
Violets are blue.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.920
Milk, eggs, coffee."

09:29.960 --> 09:33.960
Who's the most handsome man
on earth?

09:35.160 --> 09:37.240
U-R.

09:44.440 --> 09:48.720
Michael, I've thought about your
modeling job, and I came to a decision.

09:48.800 --> 09:52.640
I can't let you take
your pants off in public.

09:52.720 --> 09:55.920
But I take my pants off
in public all the time.

09:56.920 --> 09:59.280
You never said
anything before.

09:59.320 --> 10:03.600
Because before you weren't doing it
for your glamorous new career.

10:03.680 --> 10:05.920
You were doing it for the love
of being pantsless.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.040
So, now promise me
you won't do it.

10:11.800 --> 10:14.320
- Michael?
- Fine.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.760
I "plomise."

10:16.800 --> 10:18.720
I heard that.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.720
You said, "I plomise."

10:21.680 --> 10:25.200
There is no "L"
in promise.

10:25.280 --> 10:27.160
Michael, promise me
with an "R."

10:27.200 --> 10:30.640
Fine!

10:30.680 --> 10:33.120
I pr-o-o-mise.

10:34.360 --> 10:36.240
Okay, you promise
to what?

10:37.280 --> 10:41.800
I promise I won't model
my "undelwear."

10:41.880 --> 10:44.000
Michael!

10:44.080 --> 10:46.560
Oh, fine!

10:52.480 --> 10:54.440
That jerk.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.560
He really is a jerk.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.480
And you smell nice.

11:06.660 --> 11:08.540
So?

11:08.620 --> 11:11.220
Does it make you
wanna buy underwear?

11:13.940 --> 11:17.940
No, it makes me wonder who
this guy is you're massaging.

11:18.900 --> 11:20.740
That's Daryl.

11:20.820 --> 11:22.780
I'm not massaging.
It's posing.

11:24.460 --> 11:26.300
Shut up.

11:26.380 --> 11:29.860
God, he's got a girlfriend.
I've got a girlfriend.

11:29.940 --> 11:32.300
Yeah, and her name
is Daryl.

11:34.900 --> 11:36.740
Hey, Fez.

11:38.300 --> 11:40.140
Got that 80 bucks yet
for the El Camino?

11:40.220 --> 11:45.100
As a matter of fact,
I do happen to <i>not</i> have it yet.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.700
Well, why don't I hold
on to this until you do.

11:48.780 --> 11:50.620
My candy.

11:52.900 --> 11:55.300
You'll get your 80 bucks...
in hell!

11:59.220 --> 12:01.220
Hey, Jackie,
how's it going?

12:01.300 --> 12:03.700
You know, Michael,
not so good.

12:03.780 --> 12:06.700
You lied to me
and you stole my dream.

12:06.780 --> 12:09.980
How's it going
besides that?

12:10.060 --> 12:12.900
You knew I always
wanted to be a model...

12:12.980 --> 12:15.660
and you took
the job anyways.

12:15.740 --> 12:20.260
I mean, if Mr. Halverson had
offered me a job as a spaceman...

12:20.340 --> 12:23.140
I would have said no,
'cause that's your dream.

12:24.380 --> 12:26.300
I thought
that out of everyone...

12:26.380 --> 12:29.780
that you would be the one to be happy for me,
'cause you're supposed to love me.

12:29.860 --> 12:32.740
Well, if that's what you
expected from me...

12:32.820 --> 12:35.380
then obviously
you don't know me very well.

12:38.540 --> 12:41.500
Okay. Well, when you're
ready to apologize...

12:41.580 --> 12:43.500
I'll be downstairs
modeling stuff.

12:43.580 --> 12:45.980
But, Michael!

12:46.060 --> 12:48.180
Damn!

12:48.220 --> 12:50.140
Man, if I was
your boyfriend...

12:50.220 --> 12:53.020
I'd be giving up modeling for you,
and then taking it back up again...

12:53.100 --> 12:55.220
just so I could
give it up again.

12:57.540 --> 13:00.500
Well, I'm off
to the Fotohut.

13:00.580 --> 13:04.620
Hope my new boyfriend
doesn't try to make a pass at me.

13:06.140 --> 13:09.580
I... I don't think we have
to worry about that.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.380
I see.

13:15.420 --> 13:19.460
Kitty, I just mean
the whole thing is so... silly.

13:19.540 --> 13:21.980
<i>It's just so silly.</i>

13:22.060 --> 13:24.260
It's silly.

13:24.340 --> 13:27.540
Well, it didn't
used to be silly.

13:27.620 --> 13:30.620
I remember a time when you'd
beat up a guy just for looking at me.

13:30.700 --> 13:32.980
Oh. Come on, Kitty.
I'm not worried about you and other guys.

13:33.060 --> 13:35.220
I mean, you're
a little old for crushes.

13:38.740 --> 13:40.660
What?

13:40.740 --> 13:43.900
Oh, I didn't mean old.

13:43.980 --> 13:47.700
I meant advanced in... beauty.

13:56.980 --> 13:59.660
Hey. Michael and I
had a fight.

14:04.180 --> 14:08.660
Maybe if we pretend she's not here,
she'll just... go away.

14:10.900 --> 14:12.900
- I've tried. It doesn't work.
- Mm.

14:17.260 --> 14:19.820
Look, he actually
stood up to me.

14:19.900 --> 14:24.100
Things are changing between us.
I just don't know how to keep 'em the same.

14:24.180 --> 14:29.140
I mean, he's not just modeling.
He's, like, leaving me behind.

14:29.180 --> 14:34.500
Look, Jackie, you just...
You can't keep trying to control him.

14:34.580 --> 14:37.860
Yeah, that's how Eric
ran me off.

14:37.940 --> 14:40.500
Yeah, that's...

14:40.580 --> 14:43.260
Thank you.
Uh, thank you for that.

14:44.700 --> 14:46.580
Look, Jackie.

14:48.100 --> 14:51.540
Take it from a guy
who pretty much...

14:51.580 --> 14:54.260
hasn't been to second base
in over two months.

14:58.180 --> 15:00.420
You gotta let him
have his own life.

15:01.580 --> 15:03.940
You know,
maybe you guys are right.

15:04.020 --> 15:08.100
Maybe the only way to keep
someone you love is by letting them go.

15:08.180 --> 15:10.420
You know, a teacher
told me that once.

15:10.460 --> 15:12.780
But she had grown-up braces,
so I didn't listen.

15:16.380 --> 15:18.260
Oh, no.

15:19.340 --> 15:21.580
Yup, it's me.

15:21.660 --> 15:24.340
Hey, is my lady around?

15:25.380 --> 15:28.460
Leo, buddy,
we gotta talk.

15:28.540 --> 15:31.860
You're getting me
in a lot of trouble around here.

15:31.940 --> 15:34.420
- Now, I'm begging you...
- <i>Who is it, Red?</i>

15:37.420 --> 15:40.020
Listen, hophead!

15:40.100 --> 15:43.300
I love that woman
with a... fiery passion...

15:43.380 --> 15:45.740
that consumes my soul!

15:45.820 --> 15:48.500
That's right!
So you can either...

15:48.540 --> 15:50.580
walk outta here
on your own...

15:50.620 --> 15:53.900
or you can hop outta here
with my boot in your ass!

15:57.700 --> 16:01.660
Okay, I choose the one
with nothing in my ass.

16:01.740 --> 16:03.940
Good choice!

16:10.100 --> 16:11.940
Well, Red...

16:13.100 --> 16:16.580
that was a pretty good show
you put on there.

16:16.660 --> 16:21.780
You poured it on with a
"fiery passion that consumed your soul."

16:21.860 --> 16:25.380
Hey, if you think
I'm puttin' on a show...

16:25.460 --> 16:27.300
to get out of the doghouse...

16:27.380 --> 16:29.940
you're way off base.

16:29.980 --> 16:33.780
If I wanted to get out of trouble,
I'd just tell you how pretty you look.

16:34.980 --> 16:40.100
Which I've been meaning to tell you.
You do.

16:40.180 --> 16:43.020
- Oh, stow it.
- Oh, fine.

16:43.100 --> 16:45.020
But, Kitty,
you gotta understand.

16:45.100 --> 16:49.420
If I got mad at every guy that looked at you,
I'd drive myself crazy.

16:49.500 --> 16:53.940
I don't even wanna think about
all those patients down at the hospital...

16:53.980 --> 16:56.860
making googly eyes at you.

16:56.940 --> 16:59.700
Not to mention the doctors.

16:59.780 --> 17:02.740
Don't get me started
on those perverts!

17:04.859 --> 17:10.140
They think the nursing staff is
their own personal dating service.

17:10.220 --> 17:12.500
Glorified plumbers!

17:12.540 --> 17:17.060
Okay. All right, Red.
You're getting very upset.

17:17.140 --> 17:19.500
In fact, you look
downright miserable.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.619
That makes me so happy.

17:28.820 --> 17:30.660
Hey, Donna.
I just went to the store.

17:30.740 --> 17:32.580
Check out my new...

17:34.460 --> 17:36.820
empty bag.

17:45.660 --> 17:48.020
Empty bag, huh?

17:48.060 --> 17:50.860
If it's empty,
why are you so excited?

17:52.260 --> 17:57.900
Well, because of its
amazing potential for storage.

18:03.100 --> 18:05.220
Storage, huh?

18:05.300 --> 18:07.860
It better be storing
an El Camino taillight.

18:10.180 --> 18:12.020
Candy again?

18:13.660 --> 18:16.060
You sick bastard!

18:16.140 --> 18:18.980
You keep your distance,
scalawag.

18:19.060 --> 18:21.140
Hey! If you guys
don't shut up...

18:21.180 --> 18:25.780
the phrase "empty bag" is gonna take on
a whole new meaning for you.

18:28.060 --> 18:30.500
- Huh?
- What?

18:33.500 --> 18:35.660
It's a thinker.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.060
But trust me,
you don't want it to happen.

18:38.140 --> 18:40.700
Now, Hyde, you want money.
Fez doesn't have it.

18:40.780 --> 18:45.500
So we just need to think of something
Fez can give you that's worth 80 bucks.

18:48.500 --> 18:51.500
Eighteen dollars is your change.
Have a nice day.

18:56.340 --> 18:59.500
Now, I know totally nude Fez
isn't original...

18:59.580 --> 19:01.580
but everyone
seems to be happy.

19:03.060 --> 19:05.340
I'm happy.

19:05.420 --> 19:07.260
I'm happy too.

19:07.340 --> 19:09.980
Hey, man, remember
the three-foot rule.

19:11.860 --> 19:14.420
All right.
I'll stay right over here.

19:22.180 --> 19:24.500
Great.
Okay, the ball's your best friend.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.700
Give it a big smile. Great.
Now you're mad at the ball.

19:27.780 --> 19:30.540
<i>Oh, I hate you.</i>
<i>Bad ball. Great.</i>

19:35.940 --> 19:38.580
Huh.

19:38.620 --> 19:40.660
Didn't expect
to see you here.

19:40.740 --> 19:43.060
Well, I didn't
expect to come.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.980
But I did a lot
of thinking, and...

19:45.020 --> 19:47.540
No, no. Wh-What is it now?
You want me to drop out of high school?

19:47.580 --> 19:50.380
Join the Salvation Army
and go off and fight wars?

19:52.540 --> 19:54.460
I came here to talk to you
about your modeling, and...

19:54.540 --> 19:57.220
Yeah, Jackie,
I don't have time for it right now.

19:57.300 --> 19:59.140
It just isn't important.

20:00.180 --> 20:02.300
Sound familiar?
Oh, yeah.

20:02.380 --> 20:04.820
- You should go now.
- Wait, but...

20:04.900 --> 20:06.740
Okay. Hey, let's build
a sand castle.

20:06.820 --> 20:08.780
Oh, and it's your favorite thing
in the world.

20:08.860 --> 20:12.940
<i>Great! Hey, some jerk just kicked it over.</i>
<i>Boo-hoo-hoo. Great.</i>

20:14.580 --> 20:16.420
Todd, what are you
doing here?

20:16.500 --> 20:19.620
I saw you fighting with Michael.
I thought there might be a problem.

20:19.700 --> 20:23.700
Even though I really hope there's
not a problem. Is there a problem?

20:25.020 --> 20:26.900
Yeah, I think so.

20:26.940 --> 20:29.460
Well, you know what would
make you feel better?

20:29.540 --> 20:31.740
Coming to see
a movie with me.

20:31.820 --> 20:35.820
You know what? Yeah.

20:35.900 --> 20:38.060
Yeah. Let's go.

20:45.060 --> 20:47.260
Mr. Forman, Mrs. Forman.
How may I help you?

20:47.300 --> 20:50.780
You could help me
by getting some pants on.

20:50.820 --> 20:53.340
And for the lady?

20:56.580 --> 20:58.940
I'll have what he's having.

21:00.780 --> 21:04.100
Say, don't come
to my house anymore.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.500
Go, honey, go!
