00:01.710 --> 00:05.006
DRAGON: /In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.089 --> 00:07.341
the destiny of a great kingdom

00:07.425 --> 00:10.261
rests on the shoulders
of a young boy.

00:10.344 --> 00:13.097
His name, Merlin.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.894
(MAN CHANTING)

00:47.215 --> 00:48.549
Mistress?

00:51.928 --> 00:53.137
Is it done?

00:53.262 --> 00:54.597
Yes, mistress.

00:55.139 --> 00:57.600
The potion is prepared.

00:58.768 --> 01:02.563
Then Camelot and all its riches

01:02.647 --> 01:04.982
will soon be mine.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.776
(LAUGHING)

01:15.826 --> 01:16.827
(GASPS)

01:18.996 --> 01:20.414
(SCREAMING)

01:45.856 --> 01:47.191
Camelot.

02:27.940 --> 02:31.110
Keep up, Merlin.
We've got a busy day ahead.

02:31.193 --> 02:35.531
It's a busy day every day.
You and Arthur, you work me to the bone.

02:35.614 --> 02:38.326
Do stop moaning.
At least the work's interesting.

02:38.409 --> 02:40.786
Gaius, we're collecting pots.

02:40.870 --> 02:44.832
We do the same thing each and every
Thursday at exactly the same time

02:44.915 --> 02:47.376
and nothing interesting ever happens.

02:49.211 --> 02:53.466
Please. We seek Uther Pendragon.
Where can he be found?

02:54.759 --> 02:57.553
We have urgent business
with the King.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.388
Sorry, any business you have
with the King

02:59.472 --> 03:02.808
will have to be pursued
through the usual channels.

03:03.768 --> 03:05.936
But this is the seal of
the House of Tregor.

03:07.021 --> 03:08.314
Where did you get this?

03:08.397 --> 03:10.649
It does not belong to me.

03:11.484 --> 03:12.860
It belongs to me.

03:18.449 --> 03:19.742
My Lady.

03:21.285 --> 03:22.536
Merlin.

03:31.504 --> 03:34.006
Lady Catrina. Is it really you?

03:34.090 --> 03:35.883
| can hardly believe it myself.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.551
We had tidings from the North

03:37.635 --> 03:40.554
that the House of Tregor
had fallen to invaders.

03:40.888 --> 03:44.100
All that you heard was true,
my Lord, and worse.

03:44.475 --> 03:46.769
-But your father, the King.
-Gone, sire.

03:47.478 --> 03:50.523
The enemy attacked without warning.
We were outnumbered five to one.

03:51.857 --> 03:53.526
He could not endure.

03:53.943 --> 03:58.197
| wouldn't have survived had it not
been for my faithful servant, Jonas.

03:59.740 --> 04:04.495
But we did survive.
And we have made it this far.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.333
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

04:09.417 --> 04:14.213
Forgive me, my Lord.
| fear my trials have taken their toll.

04:14.839 --> 04:17.966
Your sufferings are beyond imagining,
my Lady.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.471
It would be an honor to
help you in any way we can.

04:23.180 --> 04:26.767
A bed for the night
would be most welcome.

04:28.561 --> 04:31.605
Then consider yourselves
as our esteemed guests.

04:31.689 --> 04:34.442
-It is the least that we can do.
-Thank you.

04:34.859 --> 04:36.735
MERLIN: She's very brave.
GAIUS: Yes.

04:37.194 --> 04:39.363
Sounds terrible,
what she's been through.

04:39.447 --> 04:40.865
Terrible, indeed.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.452
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

04:45.411 --> 04:48.414
Merlin! Job for you!

04:49.498 --> 04:51.000
Work, work, work!

04:59.300 --> 05:02.428
I'm sorry it's not quite
what you're used to.

05:02.511 --> 05:05.431
Forgive me,
but I didn't get your name?

05:05.514 --> 05:06.557
Merlin.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.892
Well, Merlin,

05:07.975 --> 05:12.104
considering we spent last night
in a cave, this will do very nicely.

05:12.188 --> 05:13.272
Thank you.

05:13.355 --> 05:15.733
If you need anything, just ask.

05:16.108 --> 05:18.319
My master's chambers are only upstairs.

05:18.402 --> 05:20.779
My mistress and I could not
be more grateful

05:20.863 --> 05:22.656
for the kindness you've shown us.

05:25.493 --> 05:26.702
You're welcome.

05:32.124 --> 05:33.209
(DOOR SLAMMING)

05:33.292 --> 05:34.460
(GAGGING)

05:37.421 --> 05:39.256
Well, I can't sleep here.

05:39.340 --> 05:42.343
This whole place stinks of cleanliness.

05:42.426 --> 05:43.886
Do not worry, mistress.

05:43.969 --> 05:47.598
| will find you somewhere more suitable.

06:03.489 --> 06:07.451
-Well, this is wonderful. Thank you.
-It is an honor.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.246
The Houses of Tregor and Pendragon

06:10.329 --> 06:13.332
have been allies for as long
as anyone can remember.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.626
My father often spoke of you, my Lord.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.128
And I will remember him always.

06:18.212 --> 06:21.674
-I'm sorry I never got to meet him.
-I am sorry too,

06:22.216 --> 06:24.927
for the House of Tregor is no more.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.596
No, Catrina. It lives on in you.

06:28.180 --> 06:29.932
| only wish that were true.

06:30.015 --> 06:33.769
It is, my Lady.
Your courage, your modesty

06:33.852 --> 06:36.105
and you are as you always were.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.982
Ever since you were a child.

06:38.065 --> 06:41.360
| fear I am much changed
since then, my Lord.

06:41.443 --> 06:44.989
Well, yes, it's true.
You are far more beautiful now.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.161
(YAWNING)

06:52.955 --> 06:56.834
I'm sorry. Hard day's training.
If you'll excuse me.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.460
Of course.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.629
UTHER: Arthur.

07:02.214 --> 07:04.883
- I should retire myself.
-Morgana.

07:07.636 --> 07:09.888
Can I get you anything else?
You've hardly touched your food.

07:09.972 --> 07:12.808
I'm sorry. I find I have little appetite

07:13.601 --> 07:15.060
ever since that day.

07:16.729 --> 07:19.773
-I wish I had been there for you.
-But you are helping me now.

07:20.566 --> 07:22.985
Your kindness, your companionship.

07:27.740 --> 07:31.702
| must also bid you good night,
my Lord. It's been a long day.

07:31.785 --> 07:35.080
Of course. Good night, my Lady.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.551
There's something really different
about the Lady Catrina.

07:47.635 --> 07:48.719
Oh!

07:48.802 --> 07:50.929
Most of Uther's guests just treat me
like dirt on their shoes.

07:51.013 --> 07:53.265
But she was really nice,

07:53.349 --> 07:55.184
even after all she's been through.

07:55.267 --> 07:57.603
Yes, she was always very gracious.

07:57.686 --> 07:59.104
You've met her before?

07:59.188 --> 08:02.650
It was many years ago.
| doubt if she would remember.

08:02.733 --> 08:06.278
-Now, Merlin, I have a job for you.
-Does it ever end?

08:06.362 --> 08:09.865
Give this to the Lady Catrina.
With my compliments.

08:09.948 --> 08:10.991
What is it?

08:11.075 --> 08:12.368
She'll know what it is.

08:12.451 --> 08:13.494
But what is it?

08:14.953 --> 08:16.372
Okay, okay.

08:22.461 --> 08:23.545
(GAGGING)

08:27.508 --> 08:28.967
What's that?

08:30.135 --> 08:32.054
Compliments of the King.

08:35.099 --> 08:36.600
Revolting.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.985
Uther's so stupid.

08:49.279 --> 08:53.617
So blinded by pretty things.

08:55.202 --> 08:58.997
Already he falls for me.
| can see it in his eyes.

08:59.832 --> 09:01.375
It is only a matter of time

09:01.458 --> 09:05.462
before he is completely
under my control.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.256
Excellent.

09:07.965 --> 09:09.258
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

09:11.969 --> 09:15.806
Jonas, you must take these back
to the kitchens. It's perfectly rotten.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.268
I'm sorry,
| did not mean to intrude.

09:19.351 --> 09:21.353
That's quite all right.

09:22.104 --> 09:23.439
At least I wasn't undressing.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.402
The court physician asked me
to give you this.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.530
What is it?

09:31.613 --> 09:33.240
Gaius prepared it for you.

09:33.824 --> 09:36.034
I'm terribly sorry.
There must be some mistake.

09:36.118 --> 09:38.328
| requested no medicine.

09:43.959 --> 09:45.127
Are you sure?

09:45.210 --> 09:46.587
Quite sure, thank you.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.297
| am in perfect health.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.227
She didn't ask for it, she didn't
need it, she didn't even want it.

10:03.479 --> 10:06.440
-Interesting.
-If you say so.

10:07.399 --> 10:11.570
When I treated her as a child
it was for an incurable disease.

10:12.613 --> 10:15.240
Catrina had a rare bone disorder
afflicting her joints.

10:15.324 --> 10:18.660
She often had difficulty walking,
especially after a long ride.

10:19.620 --> 10:22.206
My tonic was the only thing
that brought her relief.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.875
She walks as well as you or I.

10:25.375 --> 10:26.710
So I noticed.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.088
So the tonic was some kind of test?

10:30.506 --> 10:31.590
Indeed.

10:32.216 --> 10:35.135
And I'm starting to wonder

10:35.677 --> 10:37.346
if the Lady Catrina

10:37.429 --> 10:39.556
is really the Lady Catrina at all.

10:45.687 --> 10:48.065
What a charming idea this is, Uther.

10:48.565 --> 10:53.111
Yes, a ride before breakfast always
gives me a healthy appetite.

10:54.446 --> 10:57.074
I've had the kitchens prepare us
something special.

10:58.367 --> 11:00.244
Oh, how sweet of you.

11:39.658 --> 11:41.285
JONAS: Can I help you?

11:41.368 --> 11:44.705
(STAMMERING)
No, I was just changing the sheets.

11:45.581 --> 11:49.251
Please, go ahead.
Don't let me get in your way.

11:52.379 --> 11:55.632
All done, thank you.

11:57.634 --> 12:01.305
Merlin?
Aren't you forgetting something?

12:13.025 --> 12:14.234
Right.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.081
-What did you find?
-Something wasn't right in there.

12:28.665 --> 12:32.044
There was this strange smell
and I could have sworn

12:32.169 --> 12:34.087
the Lady Catrina's
bed hadn't been slept in.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.842
-And there was something else.
-Oh?

12:40.427 --> 12:45.432
Jonas. As I was leaving
| thought I saw something.

12:46.183 --> 12:49.019
This is going to sound mad,
but it looked like Jonas had a tail.

12:50.062 --> 12:52.856
A tail? Are you sure?

12:52.940 --> 12:54.483
| mean, I only glimpsed it for a moment.

12:54.566 --> 12:57.194
-I mean, I could be wrong.
-No, no, I believe you.

12:58.737 --> 13:02.407
Merlin, we must keep an eye on her.
A very close eye.

13:05.077 --> 13:08.872
CATRINA: How wonderful it is just to sit
here with you, Uther.

13:10.457 --> 13:14.252
It is a terrible thing to find
oneself alone in the world.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.631
Suddenly, cruelly alone.

13:21.051 --> 13:24.888
When Ygraine died I feared
| would never recover,

13:27.724 --> 13:32.229
but then as time passed
| have become used to being alone.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.565
But then you have Morgana and Arthur.

13:35.649 --> 13:38.902
-Surely they are a comfort to you?
-Of course they are. Both of them.

13:41.571 --> 13:45.575
It must be hard to be King
and father both,

13:47.077 --> 13:49.997
to shoulder all that
responsibility by yourself.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.584
But I feel sure, my Lord,

13:55.127 --> 13:58.130
that you and I shall
not remain alone forever.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.259
We will find love anew,

14:02.634 --> 14:07.264
a kindred spirit to share
the burden of this life.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.850
| believe we will.

14:15.105 --> 14:17.024
(LAUGHING)

14:18.984 --> 14:21.987
Honestly. Look at them.

14:22.404 --> 14:23.405
Are you all right?

14:23.488 --> 14:25.574
Don't you think it's odd how
quickly they've become close.

14:25.657 --> 14:30.287
There's nothing odd about that.
My father is a wealthy and powerful man.

14:33.290 --> 14:36.084
-Good evening, sire.
-A very good evening to you, Gaius.

14:36.168 --> 14:39.004
-You seem in high spirits.
-I am, I am.

14:39.129 --> 14:42.090
The Lady Catrina,
she has struck a chord with you.

14:42.174 --> 14:45.427
-Catrina is a remarkable woman.
-That she is, sire.

14:45.510 --> 14:48.430
You may remember
| treated her as a child.

14:48.847 --> 14:51.141
Such courage in the face
of her condition.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.602
Condition? What are you talking about?

14:53.685 --> 14:56.188
Oh, I thought you knew, sire.

14:56.646 --> 15:00.484
| diagnosed Catrina with
an incurable bone disease.

15:01.318 --> 15:04.029
Evidently you were wrong.
There's nothing the matter with her now.

15:04.154 --> 15:07.532
It has been a miraculous recovery,
| must say.

15:08.158 --> 15:10.869
I'm sorry, Gaius,
what are you suggesting?

15:12.120 --> 15:14.164
I'm not suggesting anything, sire.

15:14.289 --> 15:16.833
It's just a little strange,
that's all.

15:16.958 --> 15:19.669
What I see is strange is that
you won't admit you were wrong.

15:19.795 --> 15:24.091
Sire, this is not about me,
it's about the Lady Catrina.

15:24.174 --> 15:26.426
The Lady Catrina
is our honored guest

15:26.510 --> 15:29.971
and you will show her
the respect that she deserves!

15:36.853 --> 15:39.022
Is there something on your mind,
my Lord?

15:40.023 --> 15:41.733
No, it's nothing.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.362
Speak, my Lord.

15:47.155 --> 15:51.576
Is it true that as a child you
suffered from a terrible illness?

15:53.078 --> 15:55.497
-Who told you that?
-Gaius, the court physician.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.666
He said he treated you for it.

15:59.543 --> 16:02.337
Yes, my Lord. What he says is true.

16:03.505 --> 16:05.715
But as you can see, I suffer no more.

16:06.550 --> 16:08.718
And for that you must be
eternally grateful.

16:12.013 --> 16:16.852
After all, Gaius thought your condition
was incurable, did he not?

16:17.894 --> 16:21.565
Well, fortunately for us,
physicians are often mistaken.

16:22.899 --> 16:25.235
Even your famous Gaius.

16:25.318 --> 16:28.655
It is unusual, though, for
such a serious illness to cure itself.

16:31.241 --> 16:33.243
Almost a miracle.

16:34.411 --> 16:38.039
| can neither deny it nor explain it.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.877
But miracles do happen.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.505
After all, is it not a miracle

16:45.589 --> 16:48.258
that we should find each other
again after all this time?

16:52.220 --> 16:54.598
And my good fortune continues.

16:56.725 --> 17:00.937
For you are a remarkable man,
Uther Pendragon.

17:01.021 --> 17:04.566
You are brave, but compassionate.

17:06.108 --> 17:09.404
You are powerful, but modest.

17:10.864 --> 17:14.284
And most of all you are very,

17:15.868 --> 17:19.289
very handsome.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.376
-I'm sorry.
-No, no, no, my Lord,

17:23.460 --> 17:26.963
-it is I who must apologize.
-It's a long time since Ygraine.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.383
-Since anyone.
-I understand completely.

17:30.467 --> 17:33.303
There is no hurry.
We have all the time in the world.

17:35.222 --> 17:38.808
And that time will come,
| assure you.

19:04.352 --> 19:05.478
Merlin!

19:05.562 --> 19:07.564
-(GLASS SHATTERING)
-I have no doubt

19:07.647 --> 19:10.191
that you've prepared
a very good explanation for this.

19:10.275 --> 19:13.570
-Yes. No!
-Apparently I'm wrong.

19:21.870 --> 19:24.414
Please tell me you weren't
spying on Lady Catrina.

19:24.497 --> 19:28.418
-It's not what it seems.
-Yes Merlin, it's exactly what it seems.

19:28.793 --> 19:32.213
You've led a sheltered life.
You have no social skills whatsoever

19:32.297 --> 19:35.342
and Catrina is, I admit,
an attractive woman.

19:35.425 --> 19:37.302
| understand completely.

19:39.346 --> 19:43.016
If I ever find you doing it again
I'll feed you to the dogs,

19:43.725 --> 19:44.851
do I make myself clear?

19:44.934 --> 19:46.561
Yes. Absolutely, sire.

19:51.441 --> 19:52.817
(SNORTING)

20:46.871 --> 20:48.206
(FARTING)

21:12.689 --> 21:14.274
What you saw is seldom seen, Merlin.

21:14.357 --> 21:17.569
Trolls despise all other living
things, especially humans.

21:18.111 --> 21:20.697
They prefer to lurk in the
darkness of their nests,

21:20.780 --> 21:22.323
feasting on rot and filth.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.368
And Jonas? Is he a troll, too?

21:25.452 --> 21:27.495
Who can tell what manner
of creature he is.

21:29.205 --> 21:30.874
It makes no sense.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.126
If trolls like to lurk
in their caves so much,

21:33.209 --> 21:34.627
what's this one doing in Camelot?

21:34.711 --> 21:35.795
Trolls are greedy.

21:35.879 --> 21:37.672
And Lady Catrina is
like the rest of her kind.

21:37.755 --> 21:40.467
She lusts after wealth and power.

21:41.843 --> 21:42.927
Uther's wealth and power.

21:45.472 --> 21:49.476
We have reached the point of
no return. Uther has to be told.

21:51.561 --> 21:54.939
You're going to tell that his new
lady friend's a troll?

21:55.023 --> 21:56.983
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

21:59.277 --> 22:01.196
(SIGHS) Good luck.

22:04.908 --> 22:06.159
Thank you, Merlin.

22:19.881 --> 22:22.133
-My Lord.
-Yes, Gaius.

22:22.592 --> 22:24.844
| have served you for many years now.

22:26.387 --> 22:28.306
| like to think that
in my humble capacity

22:28.389 --> 22:31.184
| have advised you
to the best of my ability,

22:31.267 --> 22:34.938
and that my advice has proven
to be of value to you.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.814
Yes. This is true.

22:37.815 --> 22:42.737
And so I must advise you
that the Lady Catrina

22:44.447 --> 22:46.366
is not all that she seems to be.

22:46.783 --> 22:51.162
Oh? Then tell me, Gaius. Who is she?

22:52.539 --> 22:54.457
| believe her to be...

22:57.043 --> 22:59.712
She's... She's...

23:01.965 --> 23:03.466
Oh, come on. Out with it.

23:05.301 --> 23:06.928
She is a troll, sire.

23:09.514 --> 23:10.682
Excuse me?

23:10.765 --> 23:13.434
Some trolls have the power to take
any shape they please.

23:13.518 --> 23:15.645
This one has taken a shape
that pleases you.

23:15.728 --> 23:19.732
You are besotted, my Lord.
The creature has you in its power.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.068
-This is utterly ludicrous.
-Please, sire.

23:22.151 --> 23:25.488
Her entire family is wiped out,
but she alone escapes?

23:25.572 --> 23:29.492
She has an incurable disease,
but makes a miraculous recovery?

23:29.576 --> 23:31.619
And that is nothing but idle gossip.

23:31.703 --> 23:34.914
And is it gossip she doesn't eat her
food? Of course she doesn't.

23:34.998 --> 23:37.667
She feasts on rotten fruit
like any other troll!

23:37.750 --> 23:41.170
Enough! This attack is
unwarranted and malicious.

23:41.254 --> 23:44.090
Sire, her servant is not human,
he has a tail.

23:44.173 --> 23:45.717
| said enough!

23:47.844 --> 23:52.307
Sire, please, I just advise you
not to do anything rash.

23:52.390 --> 23:55.310
And I advise you to hold your tongue,
physician,

23:55.393 --> 23:57.895
or I will indeed do something rash.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.191
(DOOR OPENING)

24:08.114 --> 24:10.408
Did you sleep well last night,
mistress?

24:10.491 --> 24:12.577
Very well, thank you.

24:12.660 --> 24:13.786
We have a problem.

24:15.538 --> 24:19.042
-Last night. You were followed.
-Who?

24:20.209 --> 24:23.546
-The boy, Merlin.
-Merlin!

24:23.963 --> 24:26.799
Shall I dispose of him, mistress?

24:26.883 --> 24:30.303
No, no, no. That may arouse suspicion.

24:31.846 --> 24:35.391
But it is time that Uther bent
to my wishes.

24:35.475 --> 24:37.810
-And if he does not?
-Well, he'll have no choice.

24:38.311 --> 24:41.981
There's more than one way
to enchant a man.

24:51.574 --> 24:54.661
Please don't say anything, Merlin.

24:55.203 --> 24:56.496
| wasn't going to say anything.

24:56.621 --> 24:58.164
You were going to say, "I told you so."

24:59.374 --> 25:03.544
Okay, I was. But I'm not going to now.

25:04.629 --> 25:07.215
-Uther didn't take it well.
-Now, you see, I told you...

25:09.676 --> 25:10.927
Sorry.

25:11.594 --> 25:15.223
But I know him, Merlin.
He's a proud man, but he's not stupid.

25:15.306 --> 25:17.642
He'll reflect on what I said.
I'm sure he will.

25:18.142 --> 25:19.560

You and me together.

26:20.037 --> 26:22.165
A toast...

26:22.248 --> 26:24.667
A toast to us.

26:25.251 --> 26:28.254
I'm not sure everyone sees it that way.

26:29.088 --> 26:33.092
There will always be those who will
resist change. That's to be expected.

26:33.176 --> 26:35.178
We must be mindful of public opinion.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.138
What are you trying to say, my Lord?

26:37.221 --> 26:41.017
Perhaps if you were to visit
your cousins for a while.

26:41.267 --> 26:44.020
To show people that we are
not rushing into anything.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.314
You would let yourself be bullied

26:46.397 --> 26:48.816
by some petty-minded fools?

26:54.280 --> 26:56.115
But of course, of course, my Lord.

26:56.199 --> 26:58.284
If that is what you wish,

26:58.367 --> 26:59.869
then that is what I shall do.

26:59.994 --> 27:03.498
It is as you said,
we have all the time in the world.

27:08.044 --> 27:11.464
Before I go, my Lord, there's
something I want to give you.

27:12.465 --> 27:14.884
It belonged to my father.

27:15.009 --> 27:17.136
And his father before him.

27:17.220 --> 27:19.931
-Catrina, I couldn't possibly...
-No, no, no, my Lord,

27:20.223 --> 27:21.724
| want you to have it.

27:22.809 --> 27:24.811
Perhaps when you look at it

27:25.394 --> 27:27.063
it will remind you of me,

27:30.817 --> 27:33.569
and of the times
that we have spent together.

27:37.490 --> 27:40.910
- I shall wear it always.
-That is as well, my Lord.

27:42.411 --> 27:45.039
For while others doubt me,
you must not.

27:46.082 --> 27:47.917
You cannot doubt me.

27:48.543 --> 27:52.255
-For am I not beautiful, my Lord?
-You are beautiful.

27:53.089 --> 27:55.675
Am I not your heart's desire?

27:56.884 --> 27:58.761
You are my heart's desire.

28:00.221 --> 28:02.098
Then seal it, my Lord.

28:03.432 --> 28:06.269
Seal it with a kiss.

28:06.352 --> 28:09.188
Yes, a kiss.

28:26.914 --> 28:29.917
-Good morning, mistress.
-It is indeed, Jonas.

28:31.544 --> 28:34.463
The King was receptive to your advances?

28:35.423 --> 28:37.884
How could he resist such beauty?

28:37.967 --> 28:39.594
(LAUGHING)

28:39.719 --> 28:41.804
The enchantment proved effective then.

You called for me, sire?

28:59.739 --> 29:01.157
Ah! Gaius.

29:01.657 --> 29:04.076
You will be delighted to hear
that none of the worries

29:04.160 --> 29:07.622
you brought to my attention
have any truth to them whatsoever.

29:08.831 --> 29:09.999
Sire?

29:10.499 --> 29:12.168
| hope, over time,

29:12.251 --> 29:15.671
you will come to see
Lady Catrina as she really is.

29:18.507 --> 29:20.009
Over time?

29:20.092 --> 29:23.346
| have asked Catrina
to extend her stay indefinitely.

29:24.180 --> 29:26.515
-But...
-I consider the matter closed,

29:26.599 --> 29:30.186
and I hope you show me
the courtesy of doing the same.

29:32.688 --> 29:34.690
GAIUS: It's no good, Merlin.
| can tell him she's a troll

29:34.815 --> 29:37.109
till I'm blue in the face,
he simply won't listen.

29:37.193 --> 29:39.695
He sees a charming, beautiful woman.

29:39.779 --> 29:41.530
Yeah, with a body like a tree trunk.

29:41.614 --> 29:44.033
But we only know that because
you saw her in troll form.

29:45.326 --> 29:46.702
So what do we do?

29:46.827 --> 29:49.121
We must open Uther's eyes.

29:49.705 --> 29:51.457
Show her for what she really is.

29:55.169 --> 29:56.462
Using magic?

29:56.545 --> 29:58.506
It's the only way
to reveal her true form.

29:59.674 --> 30:02.969
-But she never leaves his side.
-I know.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.896
You want me to use magic
in front of the king?

30:14.021 --> 30:16.857
Yes, Merlin, I do.

30:17.900 --> 30:19.819
-But I'd never get away with it.
-I'm sorry, Merlin.

30:19.902 --> 30:21.904
| know how dangerous this is.

30:22.029 --> 30:24.824
But we can't allow her to gain
any further control over him.

30:24.907 --> 30:26.742
Who knows what
the consequences might be.

30:30.705 --> 30:34.250
Just one problem.
| know nothing about troll magic.

30:39.755 --> 30:41.549
Then we have work to do.

30:47.596 --> 30:49.432
A beautiful day.

30:53.769 --> 30:57.314
How fine it must be to have
all this at your command.

30:58.482 --> 31:00.484
It can be a burden sometimes.

31:01.444 --> 31:03.279
Let me share your burden, my Lord.

31:03.988 --> 31:05.990
Together we could achieve so much.

31:06.657 --> 31:09.243
You know there is nothing
| would like more.

31:10.119 --> 31:13.539
And, my Lord.
Would it not be a good idea

31:13.622 --> 31:15.791
to send a message to those
who doubt us?

31:16.625 --> 31:21.672
To show all of Camelot the strength
of our love, our commitment.

31:23.799 --> 31:26.969
Yes. What did you have in mind?

31:27.803 --> 31:30.848
Well, I was thinking of something
traditional,

31:32.349 --> 31:34.185
something permanent.

| know. But the principle's
the same, isn't it?

32:03.464 --> 32:06.300
| have to try it.
What other choice do we have?

32:06.383 --> 32:09.053
Fine. But Merlin,
choose your moment carefully.

Do not concern yourself.

34:20.266 --> 34:21.976
We don't know what he'll do next.

34:22.101 --> 34:23.312
He could ruin everything.

Yes?

Arthur, I'm going to tell you something.

35:21.328 --> 35:24.498
-It's not going to be easy.
-Right.

35:25.499 --> 35:27.084
It concerns the Lady Catrina.

No. Trust me.
| saw everything I needed to see.

35:33.882 --> 35:35.801
I'm sure you did.

35:35.884 --> 35:37.344
Arthur...

35:39.513 --> 35:40.764
She's a troll.

35:41.265 --> 35:42.683
(LAUGHING)

35:44.059 --> 35:45.602
She's not that bad.

35:45.728 --> 35:46.729
I'm being serious.

35:46.854 --> 35:48.188
She's an actual troll.

35:48.272 --> 35:52.026
| know what you're trying to do
and I appreciate it,

35:52.109 --> 35:53.819
but it's not about
whether I like her or not.

35:53.902 --> 35:55.779
It's about my father's happiness.

35:55.904 --> 36:00.075
When they announced it, I realized
that she does make him happy.

36:00.200 --> 36:03.537
He won't be so happy when
he finds out she's a monster!

36:03.620 --> 36:06.915
That's enough, Merlin.
She's the future Queen of Camelot,

36:07.041 --> 36:10.753
whether you like it or not.
So you better get used to it.

36:14.214 --> 36:15.716
(MAN SOBBING)

36:20.054 --> 36:21.263
Hello?

36:24.933 --> 36:27.895
Master Merlin! I'm sorry.

36:28.645 --> 36:30.606
What's wrong with you?

36:36.111 --> 36:38.447
| am a slave, a prisoner.

36:38.947 --> 36:40.240
What are you talking about?

36:40.324 --> 36:43.452
My mistress, she is not as she seems,

36:43.577 --> 36:44.745
but you know as much.

36:46.330 --> 36:48.040
Go on, I'm listening.

36:48.123 --> 36:50.709
She is a cruel, wicked creature.

36:50.793 --> 36:52.920
She keeps me in chains.

36:54.505 --> 36:55.798
She hurts me.

36:56.131 --> 36:58.425
Her magic, I can't escape it.

36:58.509 --> 37:02.596
She twists my mind as she is twisting
the mind of your King.

37:03.263 --> 37:04.515
Why are you telling me this?

37:07.184 --> 37:09.269
-I can help you.
-How?

37:10.437 --> 37:14.149
Below the castle where she sleeps,
she keeps her potions there.

37:14.650 --> 37:16.527
Every night she must take these potions.

37:16.652 --> 37:20.322
It is the magic that transforms her
from beast to beauty.

37:20.447 --> 37:24.451
If you were to take these from her,
she must remain as a beast

37:25.202 --> 37:28.163
and then your King would not
be so keen, I think.

37:29.665 --> 37:32.000
Tell me, Jonas.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.628
Why should I believe any of this?

37:34.711 --> 37:37.923
You must do as you think fit,
master Merlin.

37:38.006 --> 37:41.552
But if my mistress is
not stopped by morning,

37:43.303 --> 37:45.013
she will be Queen.

37:50.352 --> 37:51.687
(FLIES BUZZING)

38:10.539 --> 38:12.458
You won't find anything in there.

38:12.541 --> 38:13.625
(GASPING)

38:13.709 --> 38:17.421
You may possess some magic, wretch,

38:17.546 --> 38:20.090
but you are no match for me.

38:37.024 --> 38:38.192
Merlin?

38:45.365 --> 38:46.742
(GROANING)

39:13.936 --> 39:16.063
(MERLIN CHANTING)

39:32.913 --> 39:34.831
CATRINA: Jonas!

39:36.833 --> 39:40.462
Have I ever looked more revolting?

39:42.631 --> 39:43.757
No, mistress.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.425
Oh, Jonas.

39:46.301 --> 39:48.679
You always say the right thing.

40:05.195 --> 40:06.613
(CHANTING)

40:28.135 --> 40:29.553
(CHANTING)

41:04.212 --> 41:06.089
(CHANTING)

41:14.723 --> 41:18.602
PRIEST: My Lords, leaders
and gentleman of Camelot,

41:20.103 --> 41:22.773
we are gathered here today
to celebrate,

41:23.273 --> 41:25.901
by the ancient rite of handfasting,

41:26.568 --> 41:29.321
the union of Uther Pendragon

41:29.404 --> 41:31.698
and Lady Catrina of Tregor.

41:36.203 --> 41:40.207
PRIEST: Is it your wish, Uther,
to become one with this woman?

41:40.791 --> 41:41.958
It is.

41:42.084 --> 41:45.712
Is it your wish, Catrina,
to become one with this man?

41:46.088 --> 41:47.089
It is.

41:47.756 --> 41:48.965
Do any say nay?

41:58.433 --> 42:02.062
Master Merlin, can I help you?

42:02.437 --> 42:03.730
Are you lost?

42:03.814 --> 42:05.440
Step aside, Jonas!

42:06.149 --> 42:09.736
The King's wedding
is by invitation only.

42:12.614 --> 42:15.575
- I said get out of my way!
-I'm so sorry,

42:16.118 --> 42:20.288
but I regret to say that
you are not invited.

42:33.927 --> 42:36.805
With this garland I do tie a knot,

42:37.639 --> 42:39.307
and by doing so

42:39.433 --> 42:42.436
bind your hands and your hearts

42:42.519 --> 42:43.645
for all eternity.

42:47.816 --> 42:51.778
Leave my mistress alone!

42:54.948 --> 42:58.160
I, Uther Pendragon, King of Camelot,

42:58.618 --> 43:01.163
| shall not seek to change
thee in any way.

43:01.663 --> 43:05.500
| shall respect thee,
as I respect myself.

43:06.168 --> 43:07.502
(CHANTING)

43:14.342 --> 43:18.638
| now pronounce you to be
husband and wife.

43:46.708 --> 43:48.335
DRAGON: Merlin.

43:49.211 --> 43:52.214
Queen Catrina will be named
as rightful heir to the throne.

43:52.798 --> 43:53.882
(FARTING)

43:53.965 --> 43:57.052
So if Uther dies,
she will rule Camelot?

43:57.177 --> 43:58.553
Just shut up and give me the crown.

44:00.889 --> 44:03.517
My plan to undermine Arthur is underway.

44:05.894 --> 44:08.647
If she can't be stopped,
Arthur won't become king.

44:08.730 --> 44:10.732
Albion will never be born.
