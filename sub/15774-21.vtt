WEBVTT

00:03.836 --> 00:06.005
- How about chinese
for lunch?

00:06.007 --> 00:08.774
- I had chinese
for breakfast. Sunset room?

00:08.776 --> 00:10.676
- Well, how about
the pizzarriba?

00:10.678 --> 00:12.411
- We always go
to pizzarriba.

00:12.413 --> 00:13.412
- I like pizzarriba.

00:13.414 --> 00:15.080
- Just tell me
where I'm going.

00:15.082 --> 00:18.417
- Rock, paper, scissors.

00:18.419 --> 00:21.086
- I win.
- What are you
talking about?

00:21.088 --> 00:23.756
You have a rock.
I have scissors.

00:23.758 --> 00:24.957
Scissors cut rock.

00:24.959 --> 00:26.658
- Scissors don't cut rock.

00:26.660 --> 00:30.195
- Where do you think
pebbles come from, hmm?

00:30.197 --> 00:33.332
Fine. Let's do it again.

00:34.401 --> 00:35.367
I win.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.703
- What?! Scissors cut paper.

00:37.705 --> 00:40.205
- This isn't paper.
- What is it?

00:40.207 --> 00:43.976
- It's a karate chop
to your face. Hyah!

00:43.978 --> 00:45.944
Ohh! Hyah!

00:45.946 --> 00:49.114
[smacking and grumbling]

00:52.585 --> 00:53.986
[bell jingling]

00:53.988 --> 00:59.124
- Oh, I love chinese.
I haven't had it
since breakfast.

01:22.183 --> 01:25.818
- Ugh. Too much
orange chicken.

01:25.820 --> 01:28.821
Have you ever met
an orange chicken?

01:29.489 --> 01:30.722
- Ooh!
- What?

01:30.724 --> 01:33.192
- It's the year of the pig.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.494
Wow. This is my year.

01:35.496 --> 01:36.728
- What are you
talking about?

01:36.730 --> 01:39.331
- The chinese
astrological calendar.

01:39.333 --> 01:42.134
Every year is represented
by a different animal,

01:42.136 --> 01:43.902
And this year? It's me.

01:43.904 --> 01:45.571
It's the year of the pig.

01:45.573 --> 01:48.474
- Oh, porky. A year
of good fortune.

01:48.476 --> 01:49.641
- When's the year
of the duck?

01:49.643 --> 01:53.345
- Uh, I don't see
a year of the duck.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.481
- Give me that.

01:55.483 --> 01:56.849
There's a year of the pig,

01:56.851 --> 01:58.917
There's a year
of the rabbit,

01:58.919 --> 02:00.686
And no year of the duck?

02:00.688 --> 02:01.687
How is this possible?

02:01.821 --> 02:03.722
They've got a year
of the monkey,

02:03.724 --> 02:04.756
A year of the rooster.

02:04.758 --> 02:07.993
A rat? There's
a year of the rat?

02:07.995 --> 02:10.062
Why not ducks?

02:10.064 --> 02:11.730
Does everybody hate ducks?

02:11.732 --> 02:13.132
- Nobody hates ducks.

02:13.134 --> 02:14.800
- That's easy
for you to say.

02:14.802 --> 02:15.734
You're beloved.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.636
- Oh, I wouldn't say
beloved.

02:17.638 --> 02:22.241
- Oh, really? Ever
hear of the expression,
"pigs in a blanket?"

02:22.243 --> 02:25.377
- That's not an expression.
It's a food.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.412
- Yeah, a delicious food

02:27.414 --> 02:28.814
That you would pig out on,

02:28.816 --> 02:31.316
Another popular expression,
by the way.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.185
- Daffy, you're
overreacting.

02:33.187 --> 02:35.521
- Oh, really, mr.
"lucky rabbit's foot?"

02:35.622 --> 02:40.125
Star of the popular fable,
"the tortoise and the hare?"

02:40.127 --> 02:41.793
Ducks have nothing.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.996
- Uh, what about
"duck, duck, goose?"

02:43.998 --> 02:45.764
That's a popular kids' game.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.100
- Oh, you mean the one
that's super boring

02:48.102 --> 02:49.434
Until you say
the word "goose?"

02:49.436 --> 02:52.171
- Isn't there
a children's book
about a duck?

02:52.173 --> 02:55.007
- Oh, you mean
"the ugly duckling?"

02:55.009 --> 02:56.041
Thanks a lot, bugs.

02:56.043 --> 02:57.976
- Well, there's got
to be something.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.578
- Yeah, "sitting duck."

02:59.580 --> 03:01.146
Waiting around
to get killed

03:01.148 --> 03:03.148
So that you can become
a "dead duck,"

03:03.150 --> 03:05.184
Which is probably
an improvement,

03:05.186 --> 03:06.451
Considering, up till now,

03:06.453 --> 03:08.287
You've spent
your entire life

03:08.289 --> 03:09.621
As a "lame duck."

03:09.623 --> 03:11.690
[footsteps approaching]

03:13.593 --> 03:15.427
- Ooh, fortune cookies.

03:15.429 --> 03:20.065
"happiness and prosperity
are just around the corner."

03:20.067 --> 03:22.134
That sounds good.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.804
"you are charming
and well liked."

03:25.806 --> 03:28.073
Well, not really a fortune,

03:28.075 --> 03:29.508
More like an observation.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.443
- Ecch! Ecch! Ecch!

03:31.445 --> 03:35.047
Did your guys' cookies
taste like paper?

03:37.450 --> 03:40.452
This is the reason
I've never succeeded
at anything,

03:40.454 --> 03:41.853
Because people
don't like ducks.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.856
- I think it's because
people don't like you.

03:45.091 --> 03:46.124
- No way.

03:46.126 --> 03:48.093
If it's between me
and the other guy

03:48.095 --> 03:49.661
To become partner
at the law firm,

03:49.663 --> 03:51.196
They're gonna pick
the other guy

03:51.198 --> 03:52.898
Solely because I'm a duck.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.700
- And also, you're
not a lawyer.

03:54.702 --> 03:57.002
- And why do you think
that is?

03:57.004 --> 03:58.270
- Because you're lazy?

03:58.272 --> 03:59.838
- Because I am a duck,

03:59.840 --> 04:01.573
And people
don't like ducks.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.342
- Hey, guys.
I brought in your mail.

04:03.344 --> 04:04.710
- It looks like
you opened it, too.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.979
- Well, I got bored
between the mailbox
and the front door.

04:06.981 --> 04:10.682
It's mostly bills,
but I think you're
gonna like this one.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.451
They want you to host
this year's

04:12.453 --> 04:15.787
Royal oaks, glen oaks,
oakwood oaks beauty pageant.

04:16.022 --> 04:16.887
- Why me?

04:16.890 --> 04:21.360
- Well, it says here
"because you are charming
and well licked."

04:21.362 --> 04:22.294
- That's "liked."

04:22.296 --> 04:24.062
- Ok, well, you
don't have to brag.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.731
- I don't want to host
a beauty pageant.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.899
- Bugs, it's a lot more
than just a beauty pageant.

04:27.901 --> 04:31.436
It's a competition
that awards scholarships
to young women.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.437
Come on. All you have to do

04:32.439 --> 04:34.106
Is show up and say,
"and the winner is."

04:34.108 --> 04:36.341
It's the easiest job
in the world.

04:36.343 --> 04:38.176
- Eh, ok.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.245
How do you know
about all this anyway?

04:40.247 --> 04:41.546
- I was a contestant
2 years ago,

04:41.548 --> 04:45.183
But then I was disqualified
because of my talent.

04:45.185 --> 04:46.151
- What was your talent?

04:46.153 --> 04:49.655
- Lion taming.
-You know how to tame lions?

04:49.657 --> 04:50.722
- Not very well.

04:50.724 --> 04:53.959
I'd say I'm probably
just below average.

04:53.961 --> 04:54.926
- Unbelievable!

04:54.928 --> 04:56.194
I've read
the entire internet,

04:56.196 --> 04:59.765
And there's not
one positive thing
about ducks anywhere.

04:59.767 --> 05:02.367
Lola, what do you
think about ducks?

05:02.369 --> 05:03.602
- I don't know. Why?

05:03.604 --> 05:04.803
- Because I'm a duck.

05:04.805 --> 05:08.640
- What? I always thought you
were a crow. Are you sure?

05:08.642 --> 05:09.641
Aren't ducks the ones

05:09.643 --> 05:12.477
With those big beaver teeth
and that big beaver tail?

05:12.712 --> 05:13.912
- Those are beavers.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.380
- So, you're a beaver?

05:15.382 --> 05:16.648
[daffy sighs]

05:16.650 --> 05:18.517
- Forget it.

05:19.419 --> 05:21.720
[door opens and slams]

05:21.722 --> 05:22.654
[lola whistles]

05:22.656 --> 05:26.158
- Yo, that is
one touchy beaver.

05:26.726 --> 05:27.693
- Why, I remember--

05:27.695 --> 05:31.029
I say, I remember when it
was the year of the rooster.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.030
Why, that was the year

05:32.032 --> 05:33.432
That everything changed
for me.

05:33.434 --> 05:37.669
Before that, I was just
a cock-a-doodle-do-nothing
on a farm,

05:37.671 --> 05:39.137
And look at me now.

05:39.139 --> 05:39.871
[chuckling]

05:39.873 --> 05:42.107
- What does that have
to do with ducks?

05:42.109 --> 05:43.175
- Oh, right. Ducks.

05:43.177 --> 05:47.179
[intercom beeps]
carol, bring me the latest
animal popularity index.

05:47.181 --> 05:49.281
- What's the animal
popularity index?

05:49.283 --> 05:52.417
- It's a list--I say,
a list of every animal

05:52.419 --> 05:55.587
Ranked in order
of popularity.

05:55.589 --> 05:56.588
Hmm.

05:56.590 --> 05:59.091
I say, hmm.

06:05.131 --> 06:06.498
- Ducks are ranked 64th?

06:06.500 --> 06:12.003
- I'm afraid--I say,
I'm afraid ducks have
an image problem, son.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.573
What you need is
some good pr.

06:14.575 --> 06:15.607
- Ooh, that sounds good.

06:15.609 --> 06:18.810
I haven't had
a peanut butter and ranch
sandwich in forever.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.746
Would you mind, hon?

06:20.748 --> 06:23.181
I don't need a beverage.

06:24.317 --> 06:27.719
- No, pr. Public relations.

06:27.721 --> 06:28.887
Influence public opinion.

06:28.889 --> 06:33.892
And based on that,
we're gonna have to do
a lot of influencing.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.327
What to do.

06:35.329 --> 06:37.028
I say, what to do.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.063
[music playing]

06:38.065 --> 06:39.431
[gasps]
that's it!

06:39.433 --> 06:42.467
We're gonna get you
on "tit for tat."

06:42.469 --> 06:43.835
Carol, get in here.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.170
- What's "tit for tat?"

06:45.172 --> 06:47.873
- It's the most-watched news
program in the country.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.674
You'll make
the case for ducks

06:49.676 --> 06:50.709
To all of america.

06:50.711 --> 06:55.781
- Hmm. Daffy duck
as the lead spokesperson

06:55.783 --> 06:58.683
For an entire species.

06:58.685 --> 06:59.384
I like it.

06:59.386 --> 07:02.354
- Carol, get the producers
of "tit for tat"

07:02.356 --> 07:03.355
On the line.

07:03.523 --> 07:04.656
- Yes, sir.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.324
[daffy eating noisily]

07:06.326 --> 07:09.494
- Eww. Too much "r."

07:14.634 --> 07:16.701
- Hey, bun-bun.
How's it coming?

07:16.703 --> 07:17.869
- How's what coming?

07:17.871 --> 07:20.238
- Your opening monologue
for the pageant?

07:20.240 --> 07:22.340
- Monologue? I thought
all I had to do

07:22.342 --> 07:24.242
Was show up and say,
"and the winner is."

07:24.244 --> 07:26.311
- Right. After
the monologue.

07:26.313 --> 07:27.646
And the big musical number,

07:27.648 --> 07:29.281
With all that complicated
choreography.

07:29.283 --> 07:30.649
Oh, and then,
there's the duet

07:30.651 --> 07:33.518
Which also has a lot of
complicated choreography.

07:33.520 --> 07:34.820
Oh, you gotta be ready
to vamp

07:34.822 --> 07:36.421
In case the wardrobe
changes go long?

07:36.423 --> 07:37.088
And they always go long.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.957
Oh, then, of course,
there's the big finale,

07:38.959 --> 07:41.560
Which has
the most complicated
choreography of all

07:41.562 --> 07:42.627
And sometimes a stunt.

07:42.629 --> 07:45.030
Last year's host
got shot out of a cannon.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.965
- He got shot
out of a cannon?

07:46.967 --> 07:47.999
- Well, not successfully.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.835
That's why they needed
a new host.

07:49.837 --> 07:50.902
It's a thankless job, bugs.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.737
I don't know why
you agreed to do it.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.739
[door opens]

07:54.741 --> 07:56.842
[bell rings]

07:56.844 --> 07:57.876
[band playing]

07:57.878 --> 07:59.444
- Pinky, congratulations.

07:59.446 --> 08:01.112
You are my
1 millionth customer.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.582
You win a year's supply
of free pizza

08:03.584 --> 08:04.549
And half of the dessert.

08:04.551 --> 08:09.454
- Wow! I guess it really is
the year of the pig.

08:09.456 --> 08:11.289
- Porky's a pig?

08:11.291 --> 08:14.059
I always thought
he was a seal.

08:17.797 --> 08:20.866
- Are you sure--I say,
are you sure you're ready?

08:20.868 --> 08:24.769
Well, this old boy
ain't afraid to ask
the tough questions.

08:24.771 --> 08:29.040
- I have all the answers
I need right here.

08:31.144 --> 08:37.381
- Ok, uh, exactly--I say,
exactly what contribution

08:37.384 --> 08:39.650
Have ducks made to society?

08:39.653 --> 08:41.553
- That's a good
question, elmo.

08:41.554 --> 08:43.621
- I believe
his name is elmer.

08:43.624 --> 08:46.625
- Elmer? Hmm. I'd
better write that down.

08:46.692 --> 08:51.463
Uh, carol, do you have
my pre-show pr sandwich?

08:52.298 --> 08:54.065
Don't ever let her go.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.267
[munching]
mmm.

08:55.269 --> 08:56.902
Now she put too much "p."

08:56.904 --> 08:58.236
You gotta get rid of her.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.571
- We're on in 5.

08:59.573 --> 09:00.906
[daffy slurping]

09:00.908 --> 09:01.640
- Good luck.

09:01.642 --> 09:04.576
- I don't need luck.
I've got these.

09:04.578 --> 09:06.411
[both gasp]

09:07.013 --> 09:10.315
- And action.
- Ohh!

09:37.543 --> 09:39.744
- Good evening.
I'm elmer fudd.

09:39.746 --> 09:43.081
Welcome to another edition
of "tit for tat."

09:43.083 --> 09:45.050
Tonight's topic: Ducks.

09:45.052 --> 09:48.053
Here to tell us
why we should care

09:48.055 --> 09:49.054
Daffy duck.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.156
Daffy, welcome
to the program.

09:51.158 --> 09:54.759
- Thanks
for having me, elvis.

09:54.894 --> 09:55.927
- Let's get started.

09:55.929 --> 10:00.332
Exactly what contribution
have ducks made to society?

10:00.334 --> 10:03.969
- Uh, um, uh.

10:04.570 --> 10:07.038
Pass.
- What?

10:07.540 --> 10:09.240
- Give me another question.

10:09.242 --> 10:10.241
- Ok, uh.

10:10.243 --> 10:13.044
- Bring the car
around front, carol.

10:13.046 --> 10:16.281
- You believe that ducks
are viewed unfavorably.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.016
Do you have
any proof of this?

10:18.018 --> 10:19.818
- I'd like
to phone a friend.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.487
- What?
- I'd like to buy
a vowel.

10:22.489 --> 10:23.788
- What are you
talking about?

10:23.790 --> 10:25.457
- I'm gonna go ahead
and spin again, pat.

10:25.691 --> 10:29.160
- Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.563
Argh!

10:31.565 --> 10:34.299
[both screaming]

10:34.301 --> 10:35.967
- Ugh.

10:35.969 --> 10:39.904
Why didn't you open
the sunroof, carol?

10:39.906 --> 10:43.274
- You really gotta
get rid of her. Ugh.

10:43.843 --> 10:45.944
- Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

10:45.946 --> 10:47.212
And welcome
to the royal oaks,

10:47.214 --> 10:49.781
Glen oaks, oakwood oaks
beauty pageant.

10:49.783 --> 10:53.218
Ahem. I don't know
about our contestants,

10:53.220 --> 10:55.820
But I slept like a log
last night.

10:55.822 --> 10:56.855
Literally.

10:56.857 --> 10:59.524
I woke up in the fireplace.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.526
[shuffles cards]

11:04.830 --> 11:05.597
Ahem.

11:05.599 --> 11:08.199
Uh, good-looking audience
we've got here tonight.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.668
I look forward
to seeing you all

11:09.670 --> 11:13.672
During the swimsuit portion
of the competition.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.408
[shuffles cards]

11:16.410 --> 11:18.076
Because there's
a swimsuit portion.

11:18.078 --> 11:21.112
The audience doesn't
actually put on swimsuits?

11:21.114 --> 11:22.080
- Yeah. No, we get it.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.416
- Ohh! What about
the joke where--

11:24.418 --> 11:25.250
- Porky, please.

11:25.252 --> 11:28.653
I know you think
this is your "year,"
but let me--

11:28.655 --> 11:30.955
- No, I want to hear it.

11:30.957 --> 11:31.956
- Ahem.

11:31.958 --> 11:36.261
I flew all the way in
from new york to be here.

11:36.263 --> 11:40.598
And boy, are my arms tired.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.133
- Ha ha ha!

11:42.135 --> 11:44.936
[lola continues laughing]

11:44.938 --> 11:46.571
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my goodness!

11:46.573 --> 11:49.641
I can't breathe.
Oh, his arms are tired.

11:49.643 --> 11:51.443
Like he didn't fly
on a plane.

11:51.445 --> 11:54.245
He flew himself
with his arms

11:54.247 --> 11:55.680
Like they're wings!

11:55.682 --> 11:56.748
He doesn't even have wings.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.184
He's not a bird.
He's a seal.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.051
Seals can't fly.

12:00.053 --> 12:04.556
Ha ha! Oh, it's so funny
for so many reasons.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.891
Oh, porky. Oh, porky.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.993
Ohh! Ohh.

12:09.895 --> 12:10.929
Yours is funny, too.

12:10.931 --> 12:13.865
Just not as funny
as porky's!

12:13.867 --> 12:16.234
[cackling]

12:16.236 --> 12:18.069
Oh, porky!

12:18.071 --> 12:20.105
- Argh!

12:20.107 --> 12:21.206
[both screaming]

12:21.208 --> 12:23.274
This is a pr nightmare.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.876
[daffy sighs]
- tell me about it.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.979
I mean, we're talking
about 2 ingredients here.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.314
Peanut butter and ranch.

12:29.316 --> 12:30.982
How does she
keep messing this up?

12:30.984 --> 12:32.517
- Enough with
the sandwich, boy.

12:32.519 --> 12:35.286
Look at this. Now ducks
are even less popular--

12:35.288 --> 12:37.889
I say, less popular
than they were before.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.891
- We're below
great white sharks?

12:40.025 --> 12:41.259
They eat people.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.495
- Oh, it's time.

12:43.497 --> 12:44.295
- What?

12:44.297 --> 12:49.334
- The 63rd annual
royal oaks, glen oaks,
oakwood oaks beauty pageant.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.936
There are many beautiful
women in the world,

12:51.938 --> 12:56.641
But only one can be
miss r.O.G.O.O.O.

12:56.643 --> 12:57.976
- That's it.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.712
We need a duck to win
that beauty pageant.

13:00.714 --> 13:04.983
- I've always dreamed
of being miss r.O.G.O.O.O.

13:04.985 --> 13:08.386
- Not you. We need
a female duck.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.455
- Ohh. Right.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.890
- No way.

13:11.892 --> 13:12.557
- Please?

13:12.559 --> 13:14.926
- I'm not
the beauty pageant type.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.261
- Oh, of course you are.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.096
You're constantly
at the salon,

13:18.098 --> 13:19.764
You spend hours
in front of the mirror,

13:19.766 --> 13:22.967
And you're always prancing
around the house in a tiara.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.302
- That's you.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.837
- Well, I'd enter it
if I could,

13:25.839 --> 13:28.373
But that big, fat
rooster says I can't.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.541
So, you gotta do it.

13:29.543 --> 13:31.109
We're in 73rd place.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.444
- Daffy, I don't care
what some poll says.

13:33.446 --> 13:34.546
And you shouldn't either.

13:34.548 --> 13:36.347
- That's easy
for you to say.

13:36.349 --> 13:37.549
People like you.

13:37.551 --> 13:39.717
- Then be more likeable.

13:40.686 --> 13:42.153
- No. That's crazy.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.388
The only thing
that makes sense

13:43.390 --> 13:44.589
Is you winning
a beauty pageant,

13:44.591 --> 13:47.592
Which will skyrocket
ducks up the animal
popularity index,

13:47.927 --> 13:50.829
Thus allowing me to enjoy
respect and admiration

13:50.831 --> 13:53.565
Without having
to earn it myself.

13:53.567 --> 13:54.866
It's a slam duck.

13:54.868 --> 13:56.167
- You mean a slam dunk.

13:56.169 --> 13:59.838
- What? My whole life, I
thought it was "slam duck."

13:59.840 --> 14:00.638
Ugh. Forget it.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.808
I guess I'll just have
to get used to the idea

14:03.810 --> 14:05.677
That every time
I walk into a room,

14:05.679 --> 14:10.014
Everyone will wish
a great white shark
had walked in instead.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.583
Well, guess what, people?

14:11.585 --> 14:13.785
Great white sharks
can't walk.

14:13.787 --> 14:16.855
So, I guess
you're stuck with me.

14:16.857 --> 14:19.257
[sobbing]

14:19.259 --> 14:21.259
- Fine, I'll do it.

14:21.427 --> 14:22.427
- Thank you.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.762
I can't tell you
how much this means to me.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.097
I just know
you're going to win.

14:26.099 --> 14:29.234
And then, we'll both
have a tiara.

14:35.841 --> 14:36.674
- Just remember.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.776
When you're inside,
you gotta stay
curled up tight.

14:38.778 --> 14:41.412
The tighter you are,
the further you'll fly.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.081
You want to take
a practice flight?

14:43.083 --> 14:44.682
- No, I think I'm good.

14:44.684 --> 14:47.352
Porky, what are you
doing here?

14:47.354 --> 14:49.153
- I have a big favor
to ask you.

14:49.155 --> 14:53.491
What do you think
of letting me
host the pageant?

14:53.493 --> 14:54.192
- What?

14:54.194 --> 14:56.461
- Ever since I found out
it was the year of the pig,

14:56.463 --> 14:58.529
I've just been feeling
so good.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.465
Everything seems to be
going my way.

15:00.467 --> 15:03.701
I mean, you get
opportunities like this
all the time.

15:03.703 --> 15:06.738
But this, this is my year.

15:06.740 --> 15:08.706
This is my one shot.

15:08.708 --> 15:11.976
[stammering]
what do you say?

15:13.212 --> 15:14.913
- Thanks for doing
my makeup, lola.

15:14.915 --> 15:16.281
I'm not very good
at this stuff.

15:16.283 --> 15:18.783
- Are you kidding? You're
gonna look beautiful.

15:18.785 --> 15:21.486
I'm keeping it real fresh
and light and natural,

15:21.488 --> 15:22.487
Just like you wanted.

15:22.489 --> 15:25.023
You'll barely be able
to tell you're wearing
anything at all.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.758
There.

15:28.360 --> 15:29.994
- Wow.

15:29.996 --> 15:31.262
Yeah, that's...

15:31.264 --> 15:36.067
Uh, is there any way
you could remove
a few layers?

15:36.069 --> 15:38.670
- Oh. Yeah.
I can do that.

15:38.672 --> 15:40.371
Guess someone
doesn't want to win.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.473
- When is this show
going to start?

15:42.475 --> 15:43.308
What is that?

15:43.310 --> 15:46.911
- It's a constantly updating
animal popularity index.

15:46.913 --> 15:51.282
This way, we can see
those duck rankings
rise in real time.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.551
- Wow. Impressive.

15:53.553 --> 15:54.686
Oh, this is taking forever.

15:54.688 --> 15:56.821
I mean, if you say
you're going to start
at 7:00 p.M.,

15:56.823 --> 15:58.056
You start at 7:00 p.M.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.490
[yelling]
come on!

15:59.492 --> 16:01.492
Start the show!

16:01.927 --> 16:05.630
- I don't think that's
helping the cause, boy.

16:09.068 --> 16:12.203
- Uh, maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.505
- Porky, they're
going to love you.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.374
- Ladies and gentlemen,

16:16.376 --> 16:18.376
Welcome to the 64th annual

16:18.378 --> 16:23.281
Royal oaks, glen oaks,
oakwood oaks beauty pageant.

16:23.283 --> 16:27.151
And now, your host
porky pig.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.653
- You're gonna be great.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.254
It's the year of the pig.

16:30.256 --> 16:33.124
- Oh, it's not
the year of the pig.

16:33.126 --> 16:34.125
- What?

16:34.127 --> 16:35.860
The year of the pig
was 4 years ago.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.028
It's the year of the rabbit.

16:37.030 --> 16:39.530
- Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

16:39.532 --> 16:41.733
And welcome
to the royal oaks,

16:41.735 --> 16:45.203
Glen oaks, oakwood oaks
beauty pageant.

16:45.205 --> 16:46.604
- Are you sure?

16:46.606 --> 16:47.905
- I'm positive.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.941
- Oh! That nitwit
must have read it wrong.

16:49.943 --> 16:53.778
- If anyone should be
out there hosting,
it's you.

16:54.380 --> 16:55.446
- He'll be fine.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.148
All that astrology stuff
is silly.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.350
- You know, I flew
all the way in

16:59.352 --> 17:01.319
From new york
to be here,

17:01.321 --> 17:04.122
And boy, are my arms tired.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.289
Ha ha ha.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.424
[man coughing]

17:06.425 --> 17:08.760
[man clearing throat]

17:08.894 --> 17:09.627
[taps]

17:09.628 --> 17:13.196
[feedback]
- or maybe
not so silly.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.265
- Uh, ha ha.

17:14.267 --> 17:17.635
A good-looking audience
we've got here tonight.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.002
I look forward
to seeing you all

17:19.005 --> 17:22.906
During the swimsuit portion
of the competition.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.208
[beeping]
- ooh.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.710
Pigs are falling fast.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.246
They're below--I say,
they're below ducks.

17:28.248 --> 17:31.983
- Boo! Get this guy
off the stage!

17:31.985 --> 17:34.218
- Hmm. Not anymore.

17:34.220 --> 17:37.955
- Uh, why don't we meet
our contestants?

17:37.957 --> 17:40.625
[upbeat music playing]

17:40.793 --> 17:43.027
[applause]

17:43.029 --> 17:43.828
- They hate me.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.430
I thought this was
the year of the pig.

17:45.432 --> 17:46.364
How is this happening?

17:46.366 --> 17:50.201
- Porky, there's
something I need
to tell you.

17:54.506 --> 17:55.573
- You're doing great.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.476
- What? But no one's
laughing.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.344
- No, no, no.
They're laughing.

18:00.346 --> 18:02.747
You just can't hear them
from the stage.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.348
It's--it's the acoustics.

18:04.350 --> 18:08.786
- Are you sure?
I feel like they're
all scowling at me.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.054
- No, that's
the stage lights.

18:10.056 --> 18:13.991
The shadows make smiles,
you know, look like frowns.

18:13.993 --> 18:15.993
They're smiling
and they're laughing

18:16.161 --> 18:17.795
Because you're doing great.

18:17.797 --> 18:20.765
It's the year of the pig.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.033
[drum roll]

18:22.035 --> 18:23.367
That's your cue.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.970
- Thanks, bugs.

18:25.972 --> 18:29.574
[music starts]

18:31.009 --> 18:34.779
[applause]

18:53.365 --> 18:54.765
[roaring]

18:54.767 --> 18:57.135
[whip cracking]

18:58.403 --> 19:00.338
[applause]

19:00.839 --> 19:03.941
- Yeah! Whoo! Ow!

19:12.684 --> 19:13.784
- Ohh!

19:13.786 --> 19:15.686
- Eww!
- Oh, eww!

19:15.688 --> 19:18.089
- Ohh!
- Aww!

19:20.058 --> 19:23.261
[applause]

19:23.362 --> 19:27.198
- And now, the winner
of the miss royal oaks,

19:27.200 --> 19:33.271
Glen oaks, oakwood oaks
beauty pageant is...

19:33.273 --> 19:35.273
Michelle chen.

19:35.275 --> 19:38.209
Congratulations, michelle.

19:38.211 --> 19:39.610
[audience cheering]

19:39.612 --> 19:42.146
- Ohh! Ahh.

19:42.148 --> 19:43.848
[person whistling]

19:43.850 --> 19:45.917
[applause]

19:45.919 --> 19:48.519
- Congratulations.
You did it.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.021
- What are you
talking about?

19:50.023 --> 19:51.022
I didn't win.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.057
- Yeah, but you were
so beautiful and poised

19:53.059 --> 19:54.592
And charming
and elegant.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.928
You moved ducks up
33 places.

19:56.930 --> 19:57.962
- Well, there you go.

19:57.964 --> 20:00.765
- Unfortunately,
I brought us down
41 places.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.767
So, overall, ducks
are slightly worse off

20:02.769 --> 20:04.168
Than they were
before we started.

20:04.170 --> 20:05.436
- So, I guess
you're not going to get

20:05.438 --> 20:07.572
That respect
and admiration
you wanted.

20:07.574 --> 20:08.839
- What are you
talking about?

20:08.841 --> 20:12.143
I'll get it
by hanging out with you.

20:12.145 --> 20:13.044
Here.

20:13.046 --> 20:14.946
- You're giving me
your tiara?

20:14.948 --> 20:17.915
- Loaning you my tiara.

20:19.952 --> 20:22.286
Looks better on me.

20:22.754 --> 20:24.422
- Mwah.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.257
[explosion]

20:29.661 --> 20:31.629
[applause]

20:31.631 --> 20:34.265
[porky groaning]

20:34.967 --> 20:37.535
- Thanks for
the chinese food, guys.

20:37.537 --> 20:38.836
- How you feeling?

20:38.838 --> 20:39.670
- Pretty good.

20:39.672 --> 20:43.174
The doctors were amazed
at how fast I'm recovering.

20:43.176 --> 20:44.675
[laughing]
but I'm not surprised.

20:44.677 --> 20:47.345
After all, it is
the year of the pig.

20:47.347 --> 20:50.181
- I thought you told me
it was the year of the--ow!

20:50.183 --> 20:51.115
Why are you kicking me?

20:51.117 --> 20:55.720
- Did you, by any chance,
get any duck sauce?

20:56.655 --> 20:59.757
- There's a sauce
named after us?

21:00.092 --> 21:03.160
Ohh! A sweet,
delicious sauce.

21:03.162 --> 21:04.829
Why didn't anyone tell me?

21:04.831 --> 21:07.598
- I'm sorry,
but visiting hours
are over.

21:07.600 --> 21:11.335
- How about a little
respect and admiration?

21:11.337 --> 21:13.771
Ever heard of duck sauce?

21:20.045 --> 21:23.114
