00:01.914 --> 00:04.656
<i>- My lady left me...</i>

00:04.700 --> 00:07.050
<i>so I'm going back
to my first love-- </i>

00:07.094 --> 00:09.009
<i>cooking.</i>

00:11.359 --> 00:13.665
<i>- I don't need her, anyway,
'cause I've got other ladies. </i>

00:15.667 --> 00:17.278
- Time to eat,
Black Golden Girls.

00:17.321 --> 00:18.844
all: Ooh!

00:18.888 --> 00:22.152
- All this food--
Tray, you outdid yourself.

00:22.196 --> 00:24.763
- Smell like you done put
your foot, your ankle,

00:24.807 --> 00:26.591
and your calf up in here.

00:26.635 --> 00:28.158
- I know
I shouldn't say it,

00:28.202 --> 00:30.682
but, Tray, you need to get
dumped more often.

00:36.340 --> 00:38.038
- So which ones
do y'all like the best--

00:38.081 --> 00:40.475
the pulled pork, the hot fish,
or the barbecue brisket?

00:40.518 --> 00:43.173
- Ooh, Lord,
that's just like asking me

00:43.217 --> 00:47.743
to choose between Jim Brown
and Billy Dee Williams.

00:47.786 --> 00:49.832
- Well, don't forget
Sidney Poitier, now.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.181
- Oh, he was fine.
- Mm-hmm.

00:51.225 --> 00:52.791
- Focus up, please.

00:52.835 --> 00:54.576
I'm not asking y'all
who y'all wanna date?

00:54.619 --> 00:56.708
I'm asking y'all which
one y'all like best, okay?

00:56.752 --> 00:58.406
I'm trying to get hired
by this guy in the restaurant--

00:58.449 --> 00:59.668
Splendor Greens.

00:59.711 --> 01:01.409
- Oh, I heard of that spot.

01:01.452 --> 01:04.412
That's that new place--
farm to table?

01:04.455 --> 01:06.979
- Yes. I read about that.
Oh, it's very fancy.

01:07.023 --> 01:08.851
- Yeah, everybody.
- All right.

01:08.894 --> 01:10.331
- Yeah, but with Tray working
in the kitchen,

01:10.374 --> 01:11.810
it's not gonna be
farm to table.

01:11.854 --> 01:13.725
It's gonna be
farm to my thighs!

01:13.769 --> 01:16.641
- And booty!

01:16.685 --> 01:18.382
- Ooh, turn up the TV.

01:18.426 --> 01:20.080
They're talking about the
community center on the news.

01:20.123 --> 01:21.646
<i>- I love Brooklyn.
You know what I mean? </i>

01:21.690 --> 01:23.344
<i>So much.</i>

01:23.387 --> 01:26.042
<i>And I started thinking, like,
have you noticed </i>

01:26.086 --> 01:30.525
<i>how many facilities there are
for people after they mess up? </i>

01:30.568 --> 01:33.310
<i>But how many are there
to help others right before? </i>

01:33.354 --> 01:35.138
<i>You know what I mean?
Before it's too late. </i>

01:35.182 --> 01:37.749
<i>That's why this
community center is pivotal. </i>

01:37.793 --> 01:39.751
<i>It's vital to us,
Brooklynites. </i>

01:39.795 --> 01:41.971
<i>Can y'all please make sure
that baby has a coat on? </i>

01:42.014 --> 01:44.713
<i>Y'all got a coat on.
Why he don't got one? Please! </i>

01:44.756 --> 01:46.497
<i>But don't get it twisted.</i>

01:46.541 --> 01:48.369
<i>Now, it's not gonna just be
for children, no. </i>

01:48.412 --> 01:50.066
<i>It's gonna be
for adults like us. </i>

01:50.110 --> 01:51.676
<i>You know what I mean?
And we're gonna be </i>

01:51.720 --> 01:54.026
<i>tackling issues
like mental health, PTSD-- </i>

01:54.070 --> 01:56.464
<i>- Bears battle
for dominance... </i>

01:56.507 --> 01:58.161
- Oh.
- Hey.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.946
- Excuse me, we were
looking at that.

02:00.990 --> 02:02.774
- Sorry, Ma, I made a mistake
and changed the channel.

02:02.818 --> 02:04.863
- It wasn't no mistake.
- What's going on here?

02:04.907 --> 02:06.604
- Tray is
in his feelings, honey.

02:06.648 --> 02:08.780
- Veesy came over here looking
for signatures,

02:08.824 --> 02:12.175
and her and Tray got
into some kind of altercation.

02:12.219 --> 02:13.524
And were cussing each other.

02:13.568 --> 02:14.699
- She tried to say my
wheelchair

02:14.743 --> 02:15.831
was an insurance scam.

02:15.874 --> 02:17.224
- You seem to be having

02:17.267 --> 02:19.008
a whole lot of trouble
with women, Tray.

02:19.051 --> 02:21.010
- Hold on!
We supposed to be talking

02:21.053 --> 02:23.099
about how good my food is,
not my relationships.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.753
- Shit, they both messy.

02:25.928 --> 02:27.538
- Mmm.

02:27.582 --> 02:29.105
- That shit right there
gonna melt in your mouth,

02:29.149 --> 02:30.367
not in your hand.

02:30.411 --> 02:31.760
- That's honey, right?
- Yeah.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.501
- Okay, cool.
Nice little kick.

02:33.544 --> 02:35.372
I'm feeling that.
- That's what your customers

02:35.416 --> 02:36.808
gonna be saying
once you hire me.

02:36.852 --> 02:37.983
- Oh.
- Come on, Wavy, man.

02:38.027 --> 02:39.507
You know, I need the gig, man.

02:39.550 --> 02:41.335
- Come on, slow your roll.
Slow your roll.

02:41.378 --> 02:43.075
You know, we doing this
whole particular kind of thing.

02:43.119 --> 02:44.381
It's got a kind
of customer, right?

02:44.425 --> 02:46.035
A certain kind of customer--

02:46.078 --> 02:47.602
- That's why everything
you eating right there

02:47.645 --> 02:49.691
is locally sourced
and humanely raised, man.

02:49.734 --> 02:52.737
That pork right there came
from a pig named Stanley.

02:52.781 --> 02:54.609
I knew him.
He was a hard worker.

02:54.652 --> 02:58.352
Survived by his wife, Bertha,
two piglets--Woop and Oink.

02:58.395 --> 03:00.397
- And the beef--

03:00.441 --> 03:02.791
the beef right there,
that came from a cow.

03:02.834 --> 03:05.097
Mixed cow named Brownie, man.

03:05.141 --> 03:07.056
And they said
before she made the sacrifice,

03:07.099 --> 03:08.884
she turned her life
over to Christ.

03:08.927 --> 03:11.321
So you eating
sanctified beef right there.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.976
- Stupid. Right.
So I'm eating a holy cow.

03:14.019 --> 03:16.152
- Hey, Ma. I thought you was
at the church soup line.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.328
- I was, but we ran
out of food.

03:18.372 --> 03:20.635
So we had to turn people
away again.

03:20.678 --> 03:22.289
- You know, uh, Ms. Barker,
I'm sorry to hear that.

03:22.332 --> 03:23.899
You know, I might be able

03:23.942 --> 03:25.379
to help you with that
right there, you know.

03:25.422 --> 03:26.771
- Oh. Well, who are you?

03:26.815 --> 03:29.774
- Ma, this is, um--
this is, uh--

03:29.818 --> 03:31.863
It's Wavy.

03:31.907 --> 03:33.430
- Wavy.

03:33.474 --> 03:35.258
The one that
messed up your life?

03:35.302 --> 03:37.086
- Nah, Ma, he's the one

03:37.129 --> 03:38.740
that own the restaurant
I was telling about.

03:38.783 --> 03:42.134
- That probably started
with drug money.

03:42.178 --> 03:44.876
- You know what?
I think I should--I should go.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.443
- Yeah, you should go.

03:46.487 --> 03:49.490
But before you leave,
let me ask you something.

03:51.274 --> 03:54.277
Do you have any idea

03:54.321 --> 03:56.410
how much damage you caused?

03:56.453 --> 03:58.412
Not just to Tray's life.

03:58.455 --> 04:01.153
I lost 15 years
of my son's life

04:01.197 --> 04:04.679
and my grandchildren
just because of you.

04:04.722 --> 04:06.463
- Ms. Barker,
with all due respect--

04:06.507 --> 04:08.857
- Get the fuck
out of my house!

04:21.522 --> 04:23.611
- Dad, I never knew
you played guitar.

04:23.654 --> 04:25.308
- That's 'cause I don't.

04:25.352 --> 04:27.484
You know, uh, your mom's
favorite musician is Prince.

04:27.528 --> 04:30.444
So I thought I'd surprise her
and learn a lot of instruments.

04:32.924 --> 04:35.187
That's nice.

04:35.231 --> 04:38.234
- That's great. That's awesome.
But can you keep it down?

04:38.278 --> 04:40.367
Me and Amira are trying
to finish our college essays.

04:40.410 --> 04:42.978
- I am actually done.
I finished all three of mine.

04:43.021 --> 04:44.936
- You finished all three?
- Yeah.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.503
Different schools
look for different things.

04:46.547 --> 04:47.939
Here, show me yours,
and I'll just help you.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.593
- I'm not finished yet.

04:49.637 --> 04:52.553
- Okay, well, just show me
when you're done.

04:55.991 --> 05:00.038
- Well, I held on
for as long as I could,

05:00.082 --> 05:01.518
but it's happening.

05:01.562 --> 05:03.999
The time has finally come
for me to admit

05:04.042 --> 05:06.131
that I will always live
in Amira's shadow.

05:06.175 --> 05:07.872
- Shahzad,
you're gonna be fine.

05:07.916 --> 05:10.048
Don't compare yourself
to your sister.

05:10.092 --> 05:13.748
It's like me comparing myself
to Jimi Hendrix.

05:13.791 --> 05:15.271
- Wait. What?

05:15.315 --> 05:18.318
Wait. So she's Jimi Hendrix,
and I'm you?

05:18.361 --> 05:20.624
- Yeah.
- I'm finished.

05:23.453 --> 05:25.194
- Afiya, those are
the flowers I chose?

05:25.237 --> 05:26.587
- Yeah.

05:26.630 --> 05:28.197
- You know what to do
with them, right?

05:28.240 --> 05:29.894
- Okay.
- Thank you.

05:29.938 --> 05:31.766
- Man, I never pictured you
working with farmers.

05:31.809 --> 05:33.985
- I don't.
I buy all my shit from Costco.

05:34.029 --> 05:35.465
- What?

05:35.509 --> 05:37.772
I stock this whole
restaurant myself.

05:37.815 --> 05:39.513
The cooks don't even know.

05:39.556 --> 05:41.906
- So you flippin' like we used
to do on the streets?

05:41.950 --> 05:45.954
- It's a lot safer
selling fake pasteurized eggs

05:45.997 --> 05:48.391
than putting baby powder
in dope, you feel me?

05:48.435 --> 05:52.221
Look, I would've hired you
a lot sooner, but...

05:52.264 --> 05:54.005
Meet our head chef.

05:55.964 --> 05:58.009
- Tray.
- Elizabeth?

05:59.620 --> 06:01.578
- Tray. Tray.
Tray. Tray.

06:01.622 --> 06:03.363
I'm the boss,
and I say what goes!

06:03.406 --> 06:05.452
- Oh, shit!

06:11.632 --> 06:13.416
- Everyone, this is Tray--
our new line cook.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.809
- I take food
to the next level.

06:14.852 --> 06:17.159
So just show me my area.
Let me do that.

06:17.202 --> 06:18.987
- Mm.

06:19.030 --> 06:21.903
Sorry, Tray, Splendor Greens
ain't 'bout that life, okay?

06:21.946 --> 06:24.601
All our meals--
and I repeat all our meals--

06:24.645 --> 06:28.213
must look exactly
like the picture.

06:28.257 --> 06:29.432
- Got some good stuff in here.

06:29.476 --> 06:31.173
Not bad.
- Mm-hmm.

06:31.216 --> 06:32.827
- But eventually I'm gonna
want to add some stuff.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.655
- Okay.

06:34.698 --> 06:37.788
No, no laughing from you guys.
I only laugh.

06:37.832 --> 06:39.442
- What's so funny?

06:39.486 --> 06:41.836
- I mean, Tray, come on.

06:41.879 --> 06:43.707
Did you go to chef school?

06:43.751 --> 06:46.318
- No.
- I did, actually.

06:46.362 --> 06:48.756
And that's why Wavy hired me
to run his restaurant.

06:48.799 --> 06:50.453
I constructed the menu,

06:50.497 --> 06:52.847
and I'm the only one
who can make additions to it.

06:52.890 --> 06:54.457
- But if you ain't want me
to make the food better,

06:54.501 --> 06:55.719
why you hire me?

06:55.763 --> 06:58.461
- I did not hire you.
Wavy did.

06:58.505 --> 07:01.072
So, before you start studying
that menu,

07:01.116 --> 07:03.423
if you could just take
the garbage out,

07:03.466 --> 07:05.163
and while you're at it,

07:05.207 --> 07:08.166
if you could take that
attitude out with the garbage

07:08.210 --> 07:09.994
that you brought in here.

07:10.038 --> 07:11.996
Uh-oh, corn hand.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.433
Yep.

07:19.526 --> 07:22.093
- Hey, yo, they about
to throw down!

07:22.137 --> 07:24.095
crowd: Fight, fight, fight!
- What is that?

07:24.139 --> 07:26.097
crowd:
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

07:26.141 --> 07:28.317
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

07:28.360 --> 07:31.102
- Get up!

07:41.025 --> 07:42.549
- Yo, I'm breaking
this up, man.

07:42.592 --> 07:44.289
- No, let 'em fight.
Let 'em fight.

07:48.816 --> 07:50.470
- I'm sorry.
Don't hit me again.

07:50.513 --> 07:52.472
- Don't make me have to.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.127
<i>- Vamanos.</i>

08:01.568 --> 08:04.353
- Okay, we've looked
through your transcripts,

08:04.396 --> 08:06.442
and we've covered
your academic interests,

08:06.486 --> 08:08.357
and it's still inconclusive.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.186
Now let's talk passions.

08:11.229 --> 08:13.971
- Mm... oh, I always wanted
to be a whistleblower.

08:14.015 --> 08:15.799
You know how
when they interview them,

08:15.843 --> 08:19.324
they're in shadow and their
voices are really low, low?

08:19.368 --> 08:20.891
- Well, that's not
really a job.

08:20.935 --> 08:22.763
- Okay.

08:22.806 --> 08:25.505
What classes do I have to take
to become a Renaissance man?

08:25.548 --> 08:27.942
- Well, I don't think you can
just become a Renaissance man

08:27.985 --> 08:29.857
without some life experiences.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.423
- So I should be
an explorer first?

08:31.467 --> 08:32.947
- Okay, this is all good.

08:32.990 --> 08:35.384
There are no stupid answers.

08:35.427 --> 08:39.301
I put all of that in,
and the algorithm says...

08:42.086 --> 08:45.394
- What's the answer?
- Yeah, what's my perfect job?

08:45.437 --> 08:47.309
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

08:47.352 --> 08:50.530
- Really?
- You are a one of a kind.

08:50.573 --> 08:53.054
Congratulations.
He's a one of a kind.

08:53.097 --> 08:56.579
- Huh. Thank you.
- So what should I major in?

08:56.623 --> 09:00.061
- I don't think having
a traditional job is your path.

09:00.104 --> 09:01.802
You think outside of the box.

09:01.845 --> 09:04.848
Those are the qualities
of an entrepreneur.

09:04.892 --> 09:06.937
- Exactly, an entrepreneur.

09:06.981 --> 09:10.288
- I'll email you my bill.
- Thank you.

09:10.332 --> 09:12.377
- Oh, beautiful fold.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.425
- Gotta admit, Tray,
you are actually doing well.

09:18.296 --> 09:20.472
- No, no, no.
Why are you going to that?

09:20.516 --> 09:22.039
I give you one compliment,

09:22.083 --> 09:23.824
and you're already doing
things wrong?

09:23.867 --> 09:25.216
- I'm just experimenting.

09:25.260 --> 09:27.697
- No, Tray--
- Try this. Mmm!

09:29.481 --> 09:32.659
Voilà, my spicy Cajun avocado.

09:32.702 --> 09:36.358
- Okay, that's good.
It's really, really good.

09:36.401 --> 09:39.579
But it's also
against the rules, so, no.

09:39.622 --> 09:41.232
- Forget the rules.

09:41.276 --> 09:43.931
Everybody know the kitchen
is the chef's bedroom.

09:43.974 --> 09:45.802
Now, why would you enter
the bedroom

09:45.846 --> 09:48.631
if you don't
want to reach Nirvana?

09:48.675 --> 09:50.241
Here, try this.

09:50.285 --> 09:52.243
This is my sauce.

09:54.332 --> 09:55.507
Mm-hmm.

09:55.551 --> 09:57.945
- My God.

09:57.988 --> 09:59.599
That's so good.

09:59.642 --> 10:01.949
That's amazing.
We have to make that.

10:01.992 --> 10:04.255
The customers
are gonna die for that.

10:04.299 --> 10:06.040
It's great.

10:06.083 --> 10:07.650
- Come...

10:07.694 --> 10:09.304
cook with me.

10:26.887 --> 10:28.976
<i> Tell me  </i>

10:47.124 --> 10:49.083
- Yo, get it, get it, get it!
- Come on, man!

10:49.126 --> 10:51.085
Yo, come back here, man!
Idiots!

10:51.128 --> 10:54.697
- Yo, we out!
- Ooh-ooh!

10:54.741 --> 10:57.657
- Nigga!
- Oh, shit.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.528
Veesy, what you doing
in the barbershop--

10:59.571 --> 11:01.486
getting your mustache trimmed?

11:01.530 --> 11:03.445
- Oh, I know you ain't talking,
'cause if I push

11:03.488 --> 11:05.490
your ugly-ass face into dough,
we get fucking monster cookies.

11:05.534 --> 11:08.319
What you doing tearing down
my posters, you big-ass kid?

11:08.363 --> 11:10.278
- I wasn't tearing it down.
I was fixing it.

11:10.321 --> 11:12.454
- Your selfish ass
ain't fixing shit.

11:12.497 --> 11:15.326
- I ain't got time for your
judgmental shit, Veesy, okay?

11:15.370 --> 11:17.111
I'm gonna be late for work.
- Work?

11:17.154 --> 11:18.895
Who hired you?
- Splendor Greens.

11:18.939 --> 11:21.245
- Oh-oh, Wavy's spot.

11:21.289 --> 11:23.030
Now, that makes sense,
because, you know,

11:23.073 --> 11:25.685
crack-selling birds
of a feather flock together.

11:25.728 --> 11:27.556
So that makes sense.
What scam y'all running?

11:27.599 --> 11:30.211
- All I know is I'm a chef,
okay, and I'm killing it.

11:30.254 --> 11:33.823
People love my farm-to-table
organic dishes, aight?

11:33.867 --> 11:36.130
- I keep hearing you talking--
me, me, me, me, me.

11:36.173 --> 11:38.785
I ain't never heard you talk
about somebody else.

11:38.828 --> 11:40.569
When's the last time
you did something for somebody

11:40.612 --> 11:41.918
that didn't benefit you?

11:41.962 --> 11:43.572
- You know what?
Good point.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.095
Hey, Howard.
- What's going on, Tray?

11:45.139 --> 11:46.749
- Could you get
those sheep shears out

11:46.793 --> 11:49.099
and shave some
of the wool off of Veesy's back

11:49.143 --> 11:50.753
so she could donate
to Wigs for Kids?

11:50.797 --> 11:52.450
- I'm staying out of it.

11:52.494 --> 11:54.583
- How's that for doing
something for somebody else?

11:56.716 --> 11:58.935
- Have a blessed day,
you fucking prick!

12:12.862 --> 12:14.777
So much easier than the guitar.

12:14.821 --> 12:17.301
Honestly, you just breathe
in and out, and it plays.

12:17.345 --> 12:19.086
You don't find that
on a lot of instruments.

12:19.129 --> 12:20.914
- Shahzad, please hurry up
with this presentation.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.176
- Just hit play on my computer.

12:22.219 --> 12:24.047
- Finally.
- Here we go.

12:24.091 --> 12:26.180
<i>- Introducing
Shahzad Birkeland. </i>

12:26.223 --> 12:28.269
<i>He's an entrepreneur
from Brooklyn, New York. </i>

12:28.312 --> 12:30.314
- Ugh, this is so corny.

12:30.358 --> 12:32.447
- Since my college
counselor thinks

12:32.490 --> 12:34.362
I should become
an entrepreneur,

12:34.405 --> 12:36.712
I've come up
with a few business ideas.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.193
- All right.
- Exhibit A...

12:39.236 --> 12:41.804
say you're at a music festival,

12:41.848 --> 12:44.633
and your clothes are all dirty.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.417
Ugh!

12:46.461 --> 12:48.245
What do you do?

12:48.289 --> 12:51.596
- I don't know.
- I'd just go buy some merch.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.685
- Or you could put
a few quarters

12:53.729 --> 12:56.688
in the world's first portable
laundry machine.

12:56.732 --> 12:59.343
I call it the Port-O-Wash--

12:59.387 --> 13:01.955
a porta potty
that also does laundry.

13:01.998 --> 13:04.522
- That looks disgusting.
- I don't disagree with her.

13:04.566 --> 13:05.828
That's a little rough.

13:05.872 --> 13:08.613
- But wait, wait.
There's more.

13:08.657 --> 13:11.660
Say you're at the club,
then it happens.

13:11.703 --> 13:13.444
You spot someone

13:13.488 --> 13:17.405
with the exact same haircut
as you.

13:17.448 --> 13:18.841
- That's stinks.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.061
- What do you do?

13:21.104 --> 13:23.454
You can go home and cry...

13:23.498 --> 13:26.980
Or you can go into the lavatory

13:27.023 --> 13:29.547
and find one
of my bathroom barbers.

13:29.591 --> 13:30.940
- I like that!

13:30.984 --> 13:32.463
Yeah, you get a haircut
in the bathroom.

13:32.507 --> 13:34.291
- No one is gonna pay
for any of this.

13:34.335 --> 13:35.771
I'm out.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.468
- You know,
the bathroom-barber thing,

13:37.512 --> 13:39.166
it can--it could work.

13:39.209 --> 13:41.168
- That's why you're gonna
give me all my college money

13:41.211 --> 13:42.822
to get it off the ground.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.259
- Okay, first of all,
stop talking like that.

13:45.302 --> 13:47.304
Second of all,
I thought these were businesses

13:47.348 --> 13:49.567
you were going to start
after you graduated college?

13:49.611 --> 13:51.004
- But I'm a born entrepreneur.

13:51.047 --> 13:52.875
- You still have
to go to college.

13:52.919 --> 13:55.704
- College is a waste for me.
W-what am I gonna do there?

13:55.747 --> 13:57.488
- You could cut hair
in the bathroom.

13:57.532 --> 13:58.881
- I thought you were out.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.274
- Ooh, burn.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.234
That's a burn.

14:07.107 --> 14:09.892
- Man, think I'm gonna have
to fire Elizabeth.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.589
- For what?

14:11.633 --> 14:14.505
- The last couple of weeks,
I'm checking my stock,

14:14.549 --> 14:16.072
shit ain't adding up.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.944
I got more food going out
than money coming in.

14:17.987 --> 14:19.902
So either she's taking
my inventory,

14:19.946 --> 14:21.512
or she taking the money.

14:21.556 --> 14:23.688
Either way, she got to go.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.560
- She ain't had nothing
to do with it, Wavy.

14:25.603 --> 14:28.171
- Whatchu mean?
- I invented some dishes.

14:28.215 --> 14:30.608
And I was giving it
to the customers on the low,

14:30.652 --> 14:32.001
just to spice it up.

14:33.611 --> 14:35.135
- So you stealing
from me, man?

14:35.178 --> 14:36.658
- They was loving
the taste, Wavy.

14:36.701 --> 14:38.138
They kept coming back.

14:38.181 --> 14:40.140
I even got
your customer volume up, kid.

14:40.183 --> 14:43.099
- Yo, I'm running
a business here!

14:43.143 --> 14:46.624
You fucking
with my profit margins!

14:46.668 --> 14:48.278
- I'm sorry, fam.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.933
- I'm sorry, too...

14:50.977 --> 14:53.022
'cause I'm gonna have
to let you go.

14:53.066 --> 14:55.895
Now, you tell your mama
that you quit.

14:55.938 --> 14:58.201
Don't tell her I fired you.

15:08.429 --> 15:10.953
- Just came
to turn in my apron.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.824
- I heard what you did, Tray.

15:12.868 --> 15:14.565
Thank you.

15:14.609 --> 15:16.219
Thank you for sticking up
for me.

15:16.263 --> 15:17.829
- I realized
that the restaurant business

15:17.873 --> 15:20.571
wasn't for me,
but I am glad I was the first

15:20.615 --> 15:22.747
to pop that rule-breaking
cherry of yours.

15:22.791 --> 15:26.490
- It was beautiful, and
it's never gonna be unpopped.

15:26.534 --> 15:30.625
- If you ever decide to let
your inner chef run wild,

15:30.668 --> 15:31.713
hit me up.

15:31.756 --> 15:33.584
We'll cook.

15:50.079 --> 15:52.908
- This is awesome.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.171
Come on. Yes.

15:55.215 --> 15:57.608
Come to daddy.

15:57.652 --> 15:58.740
Oh.

16:03.658 --> 16:05.181
- You know,
I don't think it's fair

16:05.225 --> 16:06.748
that Amira gets
her college money

16:06.791 --> 16:08.793
to do what she wants to do,
but I don't.

16:08.837 --> 16:10.621
- 'Cause it's college money

16:10.665 --> 16:12.449
and she's going
to college with it.

16:12.493 --> 16:14.886
- But I want to start
my own business.

16:14.930 --> 16:16.497
I want to be my own boss.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.629
Do we have any
"be my own boss" money?

16:18.673 --> 16:22.068
- Shahzad, I get it.
Picking a college is stressful.

16:22.111 --> 16:23.852
You just haven't
figured it out yet.

16:23.895 --> 16:26.463
- No, no.
I have figured it out.

16:26.507 --> 16:28.204
I'm gonna take a gap year
and prove

16:28.248 --> 16:31.599
that I don't need college,
but I need money to do it.

16:31.642 --> 16:32.861
- It's not real money.

16:32.904 --> 16:34.254
It's all invested in accounts

16:34.297 --> 16:36.125
that can only be used
for education.

16:36.169 --> 16:37.866
- Dad, I looked it up.

16:37.909 --> 16:40.260
You can take it out.
It's just gonna be a penalty.

16:40.303 --> 16:43.045
- No, your mother would kill us
if we paid a penalty.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.699
- Please, Dad.

16:44.742 --> 16:47.006
- I'm not gonna let you blow
your entire college fund

16:47.049 --> 16:49.138
on penalties
and your first business idea,

16:49.182 --> 16:51.227
but...

16:51.271 --> 16:54.274
I will talk to your mother
about you taking a gap year

16:54.317 --> 16:56.145
and giving you
a small portion--

16:56.189 --> 16:58.539
a very small portion
of that money.

16:58.582 --> 17:00.454
And if you double it,
then we'll match it.

17:00.497 --> 17:03.674
But if you lose it,
you go to college.

17:03.718 --> 17:05.241
That's a deal.

17:05.285 --> 17:07.200
- It's a deal?
- Yes. Yes.

17:07.243 --> 17:09.245
Thank you, Dad.
I love you.

17:09.289 --> 17:11.378
And you look ridiculous.

17:11.421 --> 17:14.903
- When I learn to use this,
I am gonna be a musical weapon.

17:14.946 --> 17:16.905
Do not get in my line of fire.

17:20.126 --> 17:21.910
- Hey, yo, pass it.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.694
- This stuff
is going quick, Ma.

17:23.738 --> 17:26.088
I'm almost out of greens.
- I know. I'm low on meat, too.

17:26.132 --> 17:27.437
Do we got any more inside?

17:27.481 --> 17:29.004
- Ain't nothing in that kitchen

17:29.048 --> 17:30.701
except some tap water
and some condiments.

17:30.745 --> 17:32.486
- Well, I'm out
of mashed potatoes.

17:32.529 --> 17:34.096
I'm gonna go rest the dogs.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.533
- Ha ha! I got plenty
of Brussels sprouts.

17:36.577 --> 17:38.144
Come on, now.

17:38.187 --> 17:40.276
All of y'all could use
some of this roughage.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.278
- I'm sorry, miss--we running
out of a lot of stuff.

17:42.322 --> 17:43.888
I'm gonna have to get you
next time.

17:43.932 --> 17:46.587
- Tray, why you gonna lie
to this nice old lady?

17:46.630 --> 17:48.371
We got plenty of food.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.809
- I thought you was all
about profit margin.

17:51.853 --> 17:54.116
- Hey, man,
I'm just doing my part.

17:54.160 --> 17:57.337
Got my truck full of food here.
Got my guys.

17:57.380 --> 17:59.034
It's all love.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.601
- Yo, didn't I see you fighting

18:00.644 --> 18:02.472
in that alley
behind the restaurant?

18:02.516 --> 18:04.039
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.780
- You're a better fighter
than you are a liar.

18:05.823 --> 18:07.651
Slow down, man.
Slow down.

18:07.695 --> 18:09.305
The food ain't going nowhere.

18:09.349 --> 18:11.960
You fight a lot?
- Only when I need to.

18:12.003 --> 18:13.831
That dude picked
on my two little sisters.

18:13.875 --> 18:15.920
- He had
that ass-whupping coming, huh?

18:15.964 --> 18:17.139
My name is Tray.

18:17.183 --> 18:20.055
- Javier.
My family calls me Javi.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.318
- You holding up the line.
Let's go over here and kick it.

18:22.362 --> 18:24.755
Talk to you for a minute.

18:24.799 --> 18:27.062
- Uh, we got some more here.

18:29.195 --> 18:30.413
Hey, I come in peace.

18:30.457 --> 18:32.154
- How come my skin crawls

18:32.198 --> 18:35.462
every time
I hear the sound of your voice?

18:38.813 --> 18:41.163
You have a good day.
Y'all enjoy.

18:41.207 --> 18:43.078
All right, take care
of the rest of that, okay?

18:43.122 --> 18:46.168
- You like to box?

18:46.212 --> 18:48.170
- Yes, I do.

18:48.214 --> 18:50.216
- Do you train?

18:50.259 --> 18:52.566
- Nope.

18:52.609 --> 18:54.350
- Would you like to,

18:54.394 --> 18:57.136
if I got your trainer
and I got you a place to train?

18:59.834 --> 19:01.792
- Yeah, I would like that.

19:07.624 --> 19:09.235
- Stand up.

19:15.458 --> 19:17.634
You got a lot of talent, man.

19:17.678 --> 19:21.377
I just don't want to see you
waste it on the streets.

19:21.421 --> 19:23.379
Let me see your stance.

19:23.423 --> 19:24.815
<i>I love cooking.</i>

19:24.859 --> 19:26.252
Put that foot back.

19:26.295 --> 19:27.949
<i>But you know
what I love more? </i>

19:27.992 --> 19:29.211
<i>Inspiring people.</i>

19:29.255 --> 19:31.213
You know how to throw a jab?

19:31.257 --> 19:33.041
You know how to throw
a right cross?

19:33.084 --> 19:34.608
What about a uppercut?

19:34.651 --> 19:37.785
<i>It's something
I want to keep doing... </i>

19:37.828 --> 19:38.786
Faster.

19:38.829 --> 19:40.353
<i>Helping my community</i>

19:40.396 --> 19:41.745
<i>reach its full potential.</i>

19:41.789 --> 19:43.486
Give it to me!
Give it to me!

19:43.530 --> 19:45.009
Aah!

19:45.053 --> 19:46.620
<i>And I know
exactly how to do it, </i>

19:46.663 --> 19:48.274
<i>but it won't be easy</i>

19:48.317 --> 19:50.058
<i>'cause the only way forward</i>

19:50.101 --> 19:52.930
<i>is for me
to take the hardest path. </i>

19:57.500 --> 20:00.329
- Veesy?
- What?

20:00.373 --> 20:02.244
- I want to help save
the community center.

20:02.288 --> 20:04.072
I'm ready to devote myself
full-time

20:04.115 --> 20:05.552
to doing whatever it take.

20:05.595 --> 20:07.423
- All right, cool.
Then sign this petition.

20:07.467 --> 20:08.946
- Aight.

20:10.383 --> 20:11.993
What else I got to do?

20:12.036 --> 20:13.821
- The only thing you got to do
for me, baby,

20:13.864 --> 20:17.172
is to walk your funky ass
into ongoing fucking traffic.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.956
- Come on, man.
- What?

20:19.000 --> 20:22.699
- We got to put our petty beef
aside and work together.

20:22.743 --> 20:24.658
- Nah, actually, I'm good.

20:24.701 --> 20:26.747
Now move along. I'm good.

20:30.316 --> 20:31.273
- Aight.

20:33.362 --> 20:36.147
<i>A man is not finished
when he's defeated. </i>

20:36.191 --> 20:38.237
<i>A man is finished
when he quits. </i>

20:38.280 --> 20:40.674
<i>If 15 years in prison
couldn't break me, </i>

20:40.717 --> 20:44.112
<i>mm, Veesy doesn't have
a chance. </i>
