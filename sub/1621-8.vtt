WEBVTT

02:05.292 --> 02:07.794
- Riders approaching!
- Open the gate!

02:35.531 --> 02:38.032
Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell.

02:39.201 --> 02:41.661
- Envy isn't attractive.
- What envy?

02:42.287 --> 02:44.747
You should be proud
of your brother's achievement.

02:44.832 --> 02:47.333
I took the great castle of Winterfell
with 20 men.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.210
You're a great warrior.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.838
I saw the bodies above your gates.

02:51.922 --> 02:56.175
Which one gave you the tougher fight,
the cripple or the six-year-old?

02:58.095 --> 03:01.681
I treated the Stark boys with honor,
and they repaid me with treachery.

03:01.765 --> 03:04.934
You treated them with honor?
By butchering them?

03:05.018 --> 03:06.269
Before I had to kill them,

03:06.353 --> 03:09.146
- I treated them...
- You seized their home, as is your right.

03:09.231 --> 03:10.940
We're ironborn, we take what we need.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.024
Exactly.

03:12.109 --> 03:15.194
Then you made them prisoners in their home
and they ran away.

03:15.279 --> 03:16.946
Is that treachery?

03:17.531 --> 03:19.282
I'd call it bravery.

03:19.533 --> 03:22.869
- They made me a promise...
- Your little boy prisoners made you a promise

03:22.953 --> 03:25.580
and you got mad when they broke it?

03:25.664 --> 03:27.248
Are you the dumbest cunt alive?

03:27.332 --> 03:28.958
- Don't call me...
- A cunt.

03:29.293 --> 03:32.920
A dumb cunt who killed
the only two Starks in Winterfell.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.464
You know how valuable those boys were?

03:35.549 --> 03:38.384
If I hadn't killed them,
the Northerners would think me weak.

03:38.468 --> 03:41.220
You are weak. And you're stupid.

03:41.305 --> 03:42.305
I'm warning you.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.684
Go on, then. Warn me.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.357
You haven't brought enough men.

03:53.442 --> 03:55.651
How am I supposed to
defend Winterfell with just this lot?

03:55.736 --> 03:56.736
You're not.

03:57.112 --> 03:59.906
I've come to bring you home.
Father wants a word.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.657
Is this a joke?

04:01.742 --> 04:03.075
Winterfell is the heart of the North.

04:03.160 --> 04:06.120
Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.082
We're islanders, baby brother.
Had you forgotten that?

04:10.167 --> 04:13.002
Our power comes from our ships.

04:13.086 --> 04:16.547
And now that you've decorated your walls
with the bodies of the Stark boys,

04:16.632 --> 04:19.841
every man in the North wants
to see you hanged.

04:20.844 --> 04:23.346
- When Robb Stark finds out...
- He won't find out.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.972
We've killed all the ravens.

04:25.057 --> 04:27.016
We have all the horses.

04:28.352 --> 04:30.269
I've taken Winterfell.

04:31.146 --> 04:33.564
And I will keep Winterfell.

04:36.944 --> 04:37.944
Leave us.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.751
Theon, you're my blood.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.588
We both loved our mother.

04:57.673 --> 05:00.383
We both endured our father.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.845
Come home with me. Don't die here alone.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.889
I don't intend to die.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.397
You were a terrible baby, do you know that?

05:16.358 --> 05:19.068
Bawling all the time, never sleeping.

05:20.570 --> 05:23.072
And one night, you just wouldn't shut up,

05:23.156 --> 05:25.366
screaming like a dying pig.

05:27.119 --> 05:30.746
I walked over to your crib,
I looked down at you.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.957
I wanted to strangle you.

05:34.126 --> 05:37.461
And you looked up at me
and you stopped screaming.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.339
You smiled at me.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.138
Don't die so far from the sea.

06:02.446 --> 06:05.364
I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones.

06:06.658 --> 06:09.702
I already got one crow. Don't need two.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.954
Mance will want to question this one.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.457
Knows all about where the crows are
and what they're planning.

06:14.541 --> 06:18.210
The Halfhand knows more.
This one is just a little boy.

06:18.295 --> 06:19.336
Gut him.

06:19.629 --> 06:22.298
He could have killed me half a dozen times.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.674
And now he wishes he did.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.384
Gut him.

06:25.469 --> 06:28.846
He's a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son.

06:32.476 --> 06:34.268
Mance will want him.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.730
What does Mance want
with a dead man's bastard?

06:37.814 --> 06:39.065
I don't know.

06:39.649 --> 06:42.276
I think he'll want to decide for himself.

06:48.575 --> 06:52.078
He runs, I'll chop his balls off.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.789
He runs, I'll do it meself.

07:02.506 --> 07:04.799
We're even now, Jon Snow.

07:18.313 --> 07:19.939
I couldn't do it.

07:20.524 --> 07:22.108
I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't...

07:22.192 --> 07:23.359
I know.

07:24.361 --> 07:25.736
The others?

07:25.821 --> 07:28.614
When you didn't come back,
we went looking for you.

07:28.698 --> 07:31.158
We found your tracks fast enough.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.911
But they found us before we found you.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.247
They died because of me.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.708
See that it wasn't for nothing.

07:39.793 --> 07:40.918
All right, up, lad.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.212
Come on, on your feet, now.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.547
Move it.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.513
Is she beautiful?

07:53.557 --> 07:55.307
I've never met her.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.434
What's her name?

07:57.519 --> 08:00.563
Frey, I suppose. I don't know her first name.

08:02.107 --> 08:04.400
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.864
And you're marrying her for a bridge?

08:09.948 --> 08:11.699
- An important bridge.
- Ah.

08:13.368 --> 08:15.911
It was before they killed my father.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.373
I still thought I could march south
and rescue him in time,

08:19.457 --> 08:21.917
but only if I crossed that bridge.

08:24.087 --> 08:26.672
When I speak to people from the North,

08:26.756 --> 08:28.966
they all loved your father.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.510
He was the best man I ever met.

08:32.596 --> 08:35.264
I know children always think that
about their fathers, but...

08:35.347 --> 08:39.434
Children do not always think that
about their fathers, believe me.

08:41.104 --> 08:44.982
He once told me
that being a lord is like being a father,

08:45.066 --> 08:49.612
except you have thousands of children
and you worry about all of them.

08:49.696 --> 08:52.615
The farmers plowing the fields
are yours to protect.

08:52.699 --> 08:55.784
The charwomen scrubbing the floors,
yours to protect.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.454
The soldiers you order into battle.

08:59.706 --> 09:04.710
He told me he woke with fear in the morning
and went to bed with fear in the night.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.755
I didn't believe him.

09:09.507 --> 09:13.135
I asked him,
"How can a man be brave if he's afraid?"

09:14.554 --> 09:18.307
"That is the only time a man can be brave,"
he told me.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.437
I wish I could have met him.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.482
He would have liked you.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.528
Most lords worry more about their gold
and their glory

09:31.613 --> 09:33.364
than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.

09:33.448 --> 09:36.825
- He didn't care much about gold or glory.
- And you?

09:37.369 --> 09:41.288
You think I'm fighting this war
so they'll sing songs about me?

09:41.998 --> 09:43.415
I want to go home.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.878
- I want the men following me to go home.
- Then why don't you?

09:47.963 --> 09:51.757
Because we'll never be safe
until the Lannisters are defeated.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.926
And because I believe in justice.

09:54.010 --> 09:57.388
- Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean.
- That would be a start.

10:07.399 --> 10:09.108
Your Grace, milady.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.569
The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night.

10:13.196 --> 10:17.449
How?

10:22.205 --> 10:23.872
Tell me this isn't true.

10:28.753 --> 10:29.962
Why?

10:31.756 --> 10:33.257
For the girls.

10:33.341 --> 10:34.508
- You betrayed me.
- Robb...

10:34.592 --> 10:35.718
No!

10:36.303 --> 10:39.596
You knew I would not allow it
and you did it anyway.

10:40.432 --> 10:44.143
Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell.

10:44.227 --> 10:47.271
Sansa and Arya are
captives in King's Landing.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.940
I have five children,
and only one of them is free.

10:50.025 --> 10:53.902
I lost one son fighting by your son's side.

10:53.987 --> 10:57.573
I lost another to the Kingslayer,
strangled with a chain.

10:58.325 --> 11:02.411
You commit treason
because your children are prisoners?

11:03.163 --> 11:06.790
I would carve out my heart
and offer it to the Father,

11:06.875 --> 11:11.295
if he would let my sons wake
from their graves and step into a prison cell.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.839
- I grieve for your sons, my lord.
- I don't want your grief.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.966
I want my vengeance.

11:16.051 --> 11:18.260
And you stole it from me.

11:20.013 --> 11:23.766
Killing Jaime Lannister
would not buy life for your children,

11:23.850 --> 11:27.519
but returning him to King's Landing
may buy life for mine.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.856
Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.193
You've weakened our position.

11:34.277 --> 11:35.903
You've brought discord into our camp.

11:36.988 --> 11:39.490
And you did it all behind my back.

11:42.744 --> 11:45.371
- Make sure she's guarded day and night.
- Robb.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.831
How many men did we send
in pursuit of the Kingslayer?

11:47.916 --> 11:48.999
Forty, Your Grace.

11:49.084 --> 11:52.086
Send another 40 with our fastest horses.

11:52.170 --> 11:53.670
Robb.

12:11.356 --> 12:12.523
Damn.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.487
You're much uglier in daylight.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.239
What's your name?

12:21.491 --> 12:25.119
I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock,
son of Tywin.

12:26.996 --> 12:30.582
A captive knight has
a right to know his captor's identity.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.251
Brienne of Tarth.

12:32.335 --> 12:34.336
Tarth, Tarth, Tarth.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.047
Crescent moons and starbursts.

12:37.132 --> 12:38.715
Lord...

12:38.800 --> 12:41.885
Selwyn Tarth. Your father.

12:43.680 --> 12:47.057
Do you have any brothers and sisters,
my lady?

12:47.142 --> 12:51.270
It's a long way to King's Landing.
Might as well get to know one another.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.398
Have you known many men?

12:54.482 --> 12:55.607
I suppose not.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.401
Women?

12:57.485 --> 12:58.485
Horses? Ah.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.948
I didn't mean to give offense, my lady.
Forgive me.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.576
Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer.

13:05.660 --> 13:08.203
Why do you hate me so much?
Have I ever harmed you?

13:08.288 --> 13:11.874
You've harmed others,
those you were sworn to protect,

13:12.500 --> 13:14.293
the weak, the innocent.

13:14.377 --> 13:17.504
Has anyone ever told you
you're as boring as you are ugly?

13:17.589 --> 13:20.132
You will not provoke me to anger.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.843
I already have. Look at you.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.428
You're ready to chop my head off.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.389
Do you think you could?

13:27.474 --> 13:29.183
Do you think you could beat me
in a fair fight?

13:29.267 --> 13:31.143
I've never seen you fight.

13:31.227 --> 13:32.936
The answer is no.

13:33.438 --> 13:36.482
There are three men in the kingdoms
who might have a chance against me.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.066
You're not one of them.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.570
All my life men like you have sneered at me.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.490
And all my life I've been
knocking men like you into the dust.

13:44.574 --> 13:47.701
If you're so confident, unlock my chains.
Let's see what happens.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.497
Do you take me for an idiot? In!

13:54.250 --> 13:57.878
I took you for a fighter, a man...

13:57.962 --> 14:00.547
Pardon. Woman of honor.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.467
Was I wrong?

14:03.551 --> 14:05.135
You're afraid.

14:06.930 --> 14:10.015
Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer.

14:23.446 --> 14:27.324
King's Landing will fall
an hour after Stannis lands his force.

14:28.785 --> 14:33.830
It's not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei
and the court to ride west to safety.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.124
Surrender the Iron Throne?

14:36.209 --> 14:39.419
Better than seeing their heads mounted
on the city gates.

14:39.504 --> 14:41.755
Stannis will execute them all.

14:41.839 --> 14:45.217
No, a king who runs will not be king for long.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.761
He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight.

14:49.514 --> 14:53.850
Stannis, two days from the capital
and the wolf at my doorstep.

14:53.935 --> 14:57.980
The scouts assure us
Robb Stark remains north ofAshemark.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.732
Ha! The last time the scouts assured us
of Stark's movement,

15:00.817 --> 15:02.317
he lured us into a trap.

15:04.195 --> 15:06.822
Which is why my son is his prisoner.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.327
Too close to Casterly Rock.

15:14.038 --> 15:17.291
He sent a splinter force
to recapture Winterfell.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.002
The Greyjoys have done us a great favor.

15:20.670 --> 15:24.881
Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock
until he's at full force.

15:24.966 --> 15:27.175
He's a boy and he's never lost a battle.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.013
He'll risk anything at any time

15:32.015 --> 15:34.391
because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.192
We'll ride at nightfall.

15:44.277 --> 15:47.195
I want a full night's march
before he knows we're on the move.

15:47.572 --> 15:51.283
Clegane, you'll maintain
a garrison here at Harrenhal.

15:51.367 --> 15:54.202
Track down this brotherhood
and destroy them.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.833
The girl has proven herself a good servant.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.169
She'll stay on with you.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.212
See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings.

16:05.173 --> 16:09.468
He's poor company when he's sober,
but he's better at his work.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.269
You've got some
questions to answer.

16:19.354 --> 16:21.229
Who killed Ser Amory?

16:21.314 --> 16:23.815
- I don't know! Please!
- Give me the name.

16:23.900 --> 16:27.861
- Take this one out for the crows.
- I told you, I don't know.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.113
Please.

16:30.907 --> 16:33.575
Look, it's Yoren's little cunt.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.453
Used to be a boy, now it's a girl.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.080
Where's Jaqen?

16:38.164 --> 16:39.665
Don't care.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.751
Where's your stick now, bitch?

16:42.835 --> 16:44.461
I promised to fuck you with it.

16:44.545 --> 16:47.172
Come on, time to kill some wolves.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.725
You need sour cherries to make it right.

16:58.810 --> 17:01.895
And the secret is you dry the stones,
and then you break them with a mallet.

17:02.188 --> 17:05.232
That's where the real flavor is.
You crush 'em up real fine.

17:05.316 --> 17:07.483
And then when you're finished,
you sprinkle them over the piecrust.

17:07.568 --> 17:08.568
Where's Jaqen?

17:08.653 --> 17:10.444
- How would I know?
- I need him now.

17:11.656 --> 17:14.116
- Lord Tywin's marching tonight.
- You need him?

17:14.742 --> 17:15.951
He's helping me.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.119
- I saw him.
- Where?

17:21.415 --> 17:23.040
- Where? Where?
- Ow!

17:23.126 --> 17:25.377
They went riding out the gates
a few hours ago.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.627
On patrol.

17:27.130 --> 17:28.839
Let go of my ears.

17:33.803 --> 17:35.595
What do you want with him anyway?

17:51.237 --> 17:53.321
Mance is gonna march on the Wall.

17:53.406 --> 17:57.659
When he does, one brother inside his army
will be worth 1,000 fighting against it.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.828
- They'll never trust me.
- They might.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.705
- If you do what needs to be done.
- What?

18:01.789 --> 18:04.416
How does it feel
knowing those men all died

18:04.500 --> 18:07.586
so you could skip through the snow
with your little savage girl?

18:07.670 --> 18:09.254
- I didn't.
- I should have known better,

18:09.338 --> 18:11.339
trusting a traitor's bastard.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.430
He's not yours to kill, crow.

18:41.537 --> 18:42.704
Do you have to do that here?

18:44.749 --> 18:47.000
I like to keep me hands clean.

18:47.835 --> 18:50.337
Yes, but do you have to do it here?

18:59.680 --> 19:00.972
You should start wearing the gold cloak.

19:01.057 --> 19:02.516
I don't want to wear a gold cloak.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.643
You're commander of the City Watch.

19:04.727 --> 19:08.271
- You shouldn't be dressed like a common...
- A cloak slows you down in a fight.

19:08.356 --> 19:10.524
Makes it hard to move quietly.

19:10.608 --> 19:14.319
And the gold catches the light,
so you're nice and easy to spot at night.

19:14.403 --> 19:17.614
Well, you're not
sneaking through alleyways any longer.

19:17.698 --> 19:18.907
You're supposed to stand out.

19:18.991 --> 19:22.077
We had a deal
and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.787
Fine, fine.

19:25.748 --> 19:27.415
No gold cloak.

19:35.132 --> 19:36.258
What?

19:36.801 --> 19:38.009
- What?
- What? What?

19:38.094 --> 19:39.469
Why are you staring at me?

19:40.805 --> 19:43.974
You don't want me cleaning me nails.
You don't want me looking your way.

19:44.559 --> 19:46.142
Why am I here?

19:46.227 --> 19:48.395
To help me plan
the defense of King's Landing.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.773
Stannis will be here any day.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.112
And one of these explains how to beat him?

19:59.490 --> 20:01.700
"An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros."

20:01.784 --> 20:04.077
By Archmaester Shevelathin.

20:05.246 --> 20:06.621
Shevelatesh.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.206
Chevalteesh.

20:11.627 --> 20:14.546
I'd swap all your books
for a few good archers.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.673
My Lord Hand. Commander.

20:16.757 --> 20:20.176
I must compliment you
on the gold cloaks' performance

20:20.261 --> 20:21.386
these last few weeks.

20:22.305 --> 20:25.724
Did you know there has been
a marked drop in thievery?

20:26.684 --> 20:28.351
I did not know.

20:29.270 --> 20:31.771
And how did you accomplish
this marked drop in thievery?

20:32.773 --> 20:34.983
Me and the lads rounded up
all the known thieves.

20:36.485 --> 20:37.944
For questioning?

20:38.029 --> 20:39.195
No.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.699
It's just the unknown thieves
we need to worry about now.

20:42.783 --> 20:45.744
- We talked about this.
- Aye, we talked about it.

20:45.828 --> 20:48.914
Have you ever been in a city under siege?

20:48.998 --> 20:51.499
Maybe this part's not in your books.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.461
See, it's not the fighting
that kills most people. It's the starving.

20:55.129 --> 20:57.213
Food's worth more than gold.

20:57.298 --> 21:00.967
Noble ladies sell their diamonds
for a sack of potatoes.

21:01.052 --> 21:04.304
Things get bad enough,
the poor start eating each other.

21:05.139 --> 21:07.515
The thieves, they love a siege.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.518
Soon as the gates are sealed,
they steal all the food.

21:10.603 --> 21:14.314
By the time it's all over,
they're the richest men in town.

21:15.149 --> 21:19.861
Given the circumstances, my lord,
I believe extreme measures are warranted.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.072
Ah.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.283
"The Great Sieges of Westeros."

21:25.368 --> 21:27.452
Thrilling subject.

21:27.536 --> 21:31.665
Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan
wasn't a better writer.

21:36.212 --> 21:38.421
Stannis knows King's Landing.

21:39.465 --> 21:41.800
He knows where the walls are strongest,

21:41.884 --> 21:45.178
and he knows which gates are weakest.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.766
The Mud Gate.

21:51.352 --> 21:53.103
A good ram will batter it down in minutes,

21:53.312 --> 21:55.522
and it's only 50 yards from the water.

21:55.606 --> 21:57.399
That's where he'll land.

21:57.483 --> 22:00.193
And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate,

22:00.277 --> 22:02.070
what is our plan?

22:03.072 --> 22:04.781
We could throw books at his men.

22:04.865 --> 22:06.241
We don't have that many books.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.742
We don't have that many men, either.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.912
What do we have?

22:12.456 --> 22:13.873
Pig shit.

22:32.518 --> 22:34.394
I'm not cut out for this sort of work.

22:34.937 --> 22:38.481
I always imagined meself
doing something much worse.

22:38.566 --> 22:41.276
We're digging latrine pits
at the end of the world.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.319
I can't imagine anything much worse.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.239
You lack imagination.

22:48.743 --> 22:50.702
Where do you think Jon is right now?

22:50.786 --> 22:53.580
He went off with the Halfhand.
He didn't come back.

22:53.998 --> 22:55.623
A betting man would go with dead.

22:57.168 --> 22:58.752
He's not dead.

22:58.836 --> 23:00.879
No, Jon's a great fighter.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.132
Well, he's better than me
and a lot better than you.

23:04.967 --> 23:07.302
He's got a Valyrian steel sword.

23:08.304 --> 23:09.679
So did his father.

23:10.097 --> 23:12.557
And Qhorin Halfhand
is the greatest ranger alive.

23:12.641 --> 23:15.435
Great rangers never get old is the problem.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.270
Shit ones neither.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.316
It's them in the middle that last a long time.

23:26.447 --> 23:28.615
What in seven hells is that?

23:44.381 --> 23:46.633
The First Men made these marks.

23:46.717 --> 23:48.343
Help me with it.

24:02.024 --> 24:03.024
Look.

24:07.363 --> 24:09.697
If you find something you're not supposed to,

24:09.782 --> 24:13.076
best thing to do
is pretend you've never seen it.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.161
That's a Night's Watch cloak.

24:15.246 --> 24:16.913
It's been here a long time.

24:22.378 --> 24:23.378
Oh.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.296
Must be dragonglass.

24:25.381 --> 24:26.756
Dragonglass?

24:27.216 --> 24:29.425
The maesters call it obsidian.

24:31.679 --> 24:32.971
Why would a brother hide it here?

24:33.597 --> 24:36.891
I expect it's 'cause
he wanted somebody to find it.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.440
Mind where you're going.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.701
I'm sorry. I'll...

24:55.911 --> 24:57.662
Where were you?

24:57.746 --> 24:58.997
A man has patrol duty.

24:59.081 --> 25:01.875
Tywin Lannister was right here,
and now he's gone.

25:01.959 --> 25:03.918
A girl owes one more name.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.004
The Red God demands it.
Give the man a name.

25:07.798 --> 25:11.593
How long after I give you the name
does it take you to kill someone?

25:11.677 --> 25:14.512
A minute, an hour, a month.

25:16.265 --> 25:17.599
Death is certain,

25:18.934 --> 25:20.351
the time is not.

25:20.436 --> 25:22.687
He's taking his army to attack my brother.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.814
I need him dead right now.

25:25.441 --> 25:27.275
This a man cannot do.

25:28.611 --> 25:30.111
You promised you'd help me.

25:30.321 --> 25:33.198
Help was not promised, lovely girl.
Only death.

25:33.991 --> 25:37.493
There must be others. Give a name, any name.

25:37.578 --> 25:39.370
And you'll kill them?

25:40.206 --> 25:41.456
Anybody?

25:44.752 --> 25:47.545
By the Seven New Gods
and the Old Gods beyond counting,

25:47.630 --> 25:49.214
I swear it.

25:52.301 --> 25:53.635
All right.

25:59.308 --> 26:00.975
Jaqen H'ghar.

26:07.650 --> 26:09.484
A girl gives a man his own name?

26:09.902 --> 26:12.153
- That's right.
- Gods are not mocked.

26:12.321 --> 26:14.739
- This is no joking thing.
- I'm not joking.

26:14.823 --> 26:16.282
A man can go kill himself.

26:16.367 --> 26:17.742
Un-name me.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.244
- No.
- Please?

26:21.914 --> 26:22.997
I'll un-name you.

26:24.792 --> 26:26.876
- Thank you.
- If you help me and my friends escape.

26:29.255 --> 26:30.755
This would require more than one life.

26:30.839 --> 26:33.925
- This is not part of our bargain.
- Fine, Jaqen H'ghar.

26:34.718 --> 26:35.885
A girl lacks honor.

26:44.186 --> 26:47.063
If I do this thing, a girl must obey.

26:47.147 --> 26:48.856
A girl will obey.

26:51.026 --> 26:54.862
A girl and her friends will
walk through the gate at midnight.

26:59.201 --> 27:00.910
Thank you, Podrick.

27:07.668 --> 27:09.210
Odd little boy.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.713
I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.

27:12.589 --> 27:14.173
You and Varys both.

27:16.176 --> 27:18.303
Excellent lamprey pie.

27:18.387 --> 27:21.472
Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day?

27:22.057 --> 27:23.766
I hear Joffrey plans on fighting.

27:24.435 --> 27:26.185
An inspiration for the troops.

27:26.270 --> 27:27.895
The young king in his shining armor

27:28.105 --> 27:30.648
fighting to defend the capital
against the wicked old rebel.

27:30.733 --> 27:32.608
He's only a boy.

27:32.693 --> 27:35.403
Younger boys are off fighting his war.

27:36.030 --> 27:38.573
- He's not ready.
- What is he, 17?

27:39.366 --> 27:41.951
- Remember Jaime at 17?
- Better than you.

27:42.536 --> 27:45.038
Some men have a gift for this sort of thing,

27:45.122 --> 27:46.956
some don't.

27:47.041 --> 27:48.750
His place is not on the battlefield.

27:48.917 --> 27:51.002
It's not on the throne, either,

27:51.086 --> 27:52.837
sadly for all of us.

27:56.592 --> 27:58.176
Do you think I'm an idiot?

27:58.260 --> 28:00.511
No, I'd say you possess
above-average intelligence.

28:00.596 --> 28:03.014
You shipped off my only daughter.

28:03.098 --> 28:06.100
And now you want to send my eldest son
to the battlefield to die.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.519
He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him.

28:08.604 --> 28:11.522
He has the finest armor gold can buy.

28:11.607 --> 28:13.191
He needs to be out there.

28:13.275 --> 28:16.861
The men will fight more fiercely
seeing their king fighting beside them

28:16.945 --> 28:19.489
instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts.

28:20.491 --> 28:21.908
Any dessert?

28:22.701 --> 28:25.495
Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?

28:25.579 --> 28:28.873
Because he has
thousands of spies in his employ.

28:28.957 --> 28:31.751
Because he knows everything we do
before we do it.

28:31.835 --> 28:33.211
Because he doesn't have a cock.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.546
Neither do you.

28:37.132 --> 28:39.717
Perhaps I'm dangerous, too.

28:39.802 --> 28:43.846
You, on the other hand,
are as big a fool as every other man.

28:44.181 --> 28:47.725
That little worm between your legs
does half your thinking.

28:47.810 --> 28:49.477
It's not that little.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.735
Why are you smiling?

28:58.320 --> 28:59.821
Because I'm happy.

29:00.197 --> 29:01.864
And why are you happy?

29:06.036 --> 29:08.538
Because I have your little whore.

29:11.834 --> 29:13.584
I thought you preferred blondes.

29:13.669 --> 29:15.420
Such a droll little fellow.

29:15.504 --> 29:17.255
Tell me, have you married this one yet?

29:18.090 --> 29:19.298
No?

29:19.758 --> 29:22.135
Good. Father will be so pleased.

29:22.219 --> 29:24.262
Why do you care who I fuck?

29:24.346 --> 29:26.931
Because a Lannister always pays her debts.

29:27.015 --> 29:28.474
You stole my only daughter,

29:28.767 --> 29:30.184
you plot to have Joffrey killed.

29:30.436 --> 29:33.229
This is madness. Stannis will be here in days.

29:33.313 --> 29:34.605
- You need me.
- For what?

29:34.690 --> 29:36.524
Your skill in battle?

29:38.527 --> 29:40.528
Pretty thing, your whore.

29:41.530 --> 29:42.947
Lovely body.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.741
The bruises will heal in time.

29:47.411 --> 29:48.995
Where did you find her?

29:49.079 --> 29:51.330
Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers.

29:51.707 --> 29:54.250
Really, a Lannister lion necklace?

29:55.335 --> 29:57.962
You need to hide your secret whores
more carefully.

29:58.046 --> 30:00.923
You've forgotten the most
important thing about whores.

30:01.008 --> 30:02.008
Oh?

30:02.968 --> 30:05.511
Well, you're the expert. Tell me.

30:06.722 --> 30:08.556
You don't buy them,

30:08.640 --> 30:10.475
you only rent them.

30:11.351 --> 30:14.270
You're usually a better liar, baby brother.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.772
This one you like.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.734
You like her very much.

30:20.903 --> 30:21.986
Could it be love?

30:23.197 --> 30:25.907
Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.492
Unless Joffrey is hurt.

30:27.576 --> 30:30.870
And then every wound he suffers,
she'll suffer, too.

30:31.288 --> 30:32.914
And if he dies,

30:33.790 --> 30:38.836
there isn't a man alive who could devise
a more painful death for your little cunt.

30:41.798 --> 30:45.176
And how do I know
you haven't killed her already?

30:45.260 --> 30:46.469
Would you like to see her?

30:46.553 --> 30:48.179
I thought you might.

30:48.263 --> 30:51.140
Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore.

31:23.549 --> 31:25.550
I'm sorry they hurt you.

31:26.969 --> 31:28.761
You must be brave.

31:34.268 --> 31:36.477
I promise I will free you.

31:38.605 --> 31:39.772
Don't forget me.

31:40.482 --> 31:41.649
Never.

32:00.210 --> 32:02.336
I will hurt you for this.

32:02.796 --> 32:06.424
A day will come
when you think you're safe and happy,

32:06.508 --> 32:10.011
and yourjoy will turn to ashes in your mouth.

32:11.471 --> 32:13.097
And you will know the debt is paid.

32:13.890 --> 32:16.017
Get out.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.155
Shae!

32:32.367 --> 32:34.493
I've been waiting all night.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.162
What is wrong?

32:37.039 --> 32:38.164
You're beautiful.

32:46.381 --> 32:48.382
Then why do you look sad?

32:55.515 --> 32:57.099
We have to be more careful.

32:57.184 --> 33:00.102
Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself.

33:00.729 --> 33:03.731
There are people who want to hurt me.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.775
I know. I won't let them.

33:06.151 --> 33:08.569
I'll cut off their faces. I will.

33:13.325 --> 33:15.743
I would kill for you. Do you know that?

33:17.663 --> 33:20.498
I expect I'll have to before this is over.

33:23.377 --> 33:24.752
You're mine.

33:26.380 --> 33:28.047
I'm yours.

33:29.132 --> 33:30.675
Promise me.

33:34.429 --> 33:36.681
I'm yours, and you are mine.

33:48.902 --> 33:50.653
Still no word?

33:51.113 --> 33:54.281
We've sent a dozen ravens.
None have returned.

33:56.201 --> 33:59.203
My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell.

33:59.287 --> 34:01.330
- Once he captures the castle...
- Theon has my brothers.

34:01.415 --> 34:05.126
- If we storm the castle...
- He wouldn't dare hurt the boys.

34:06.503 --> 34:10.297
They're his only hope
of escaping the North with his head.

34:11.675 --> 34:13.634
Send word to your son.

34:15.011 --> 34:19.598
Any ironborn who surrender will be allowed
to return safely to their homes.

34:20.308 --> 34:23.185
A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace.
Too much...

34:23.270 --> 34:26.938
Any ironborn with the exception
of Theon Greyjoy.

34:28.024 --> 34:30.067
He betrayed our cause.

34:30.485 --> 34:32.820
He betrayed me.

34:32.904 --> 34:35.614
And we will hunt him down
no matter where he runs.

34:35.824 --> 34:38.909
I expect his countrymen will turn on him
the minute they hear the offer.

34:42.246 --> 34:44.790
Your pardon, my lord. Your Grace.

34:44.875 --> 34:46.292
My lady.

34:58.472 --> 34:59.972
How are you?

35:01.558 --> 35:03.184
How am I?

35:03.268 --> 35:05.436
I've had to arrest my mother.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.605
The Lannisters have my sisters.

35:07.689 --> 35:10.357
The man I considered my closest friend

35:10.442 --> 35:12.651
has seized my home and my brothers.

35:12.736 --> 35:15.529
I'm fighting a war and I don't know
if I should march south or north.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.908
I'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.

35:18.992 --> 35:20.367
No.

35:20.452 --> 35:21.827
Forgive me.

35:22.496 --> 35:23.704
You're being kind.

35:24.372 --> 35:26.916
- I have no right.
- You have every right.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.334
You're a king.

35:28.418 --> 35:30.503
That's not the kind of king I want to be.

35:31.505 --> 35:33.130
What kind do you want to be?

35:33.215 --> 35:34.215
I don't know.

35:34.299 --> 35:35.716
The good kind.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.388
Most kings grew up as princes.

35:41.473 --> 35:44.767
They spend their whole lives
preparing for the crown.

35:44.851 --> 35:47.478
I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.

35:49.564 --> 35:52.107
I was raised to be a proper little lady,

35:52.192 --> 35:57.321
to play the harp and dance the latest steps
and recite Valyrian poetry.

35:57.405 --> 35:58.739
I'd like to hear you play the harp.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.866
No. No, you would not.

36:06.081 --> 36:09.250
How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry

36:10.043 --> 36:12.127
to sawing off men's feet?

36:22.222 --> 36:24.348
When I was 12,

36:24.432 --> 36:27.059
my mother and father went to a wedding.

36:27.143 --> 36:30.312
Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know.

36:30.397 --> 36:33.107
And they left me with my little brother.

36:33.984 --> 36:38.320
The second afternoon they were gone
was the hottest day in the three-year summer.

36:39.114 --> 36:43.075
We couldn't bear to be inside,
so we ran down to the Rhoyne.

36:43.159 --> 36:46.453
Every child in Volantis
was in the Rhoyne that day.

36:47.914 --> 36:49.957
The rich, the poor, we were all there.

36:50.041 --> 36:53.419
Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands.

36:53.628 --> 36:56.922
Drummers were playing
for coppers on the east bank.

37:00.677 --> 37:02.553
I was treading water,

37:03.388 --> 37:05.514
talking to a friend,

37:05.599 --> 37:08.726
when I realized I hadn't seen my brother.

37:09.477 --> 37:11.353
I called his name.

37:12.564 --> 37:15.149
Then I started screaming his name.

37:16.985 --> 37:18.485
And then I saw him...

37:19.487 --> 37:21.488
floating face down.

37:23.283 --> 37:25.993
My heart just... stopped.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.453
I was...

37:31.666 --> 37:34.001
I dragged him from the water.

37:34.836 --> 37:36.962
My friend helped me, I think.

37:37.047 --> 37:39.006
I don't even remember.

37:41.676 --> 37:43.344
He was so little.

37:44.763 --> 37:47.473
Then we pulled him onto the riverbank.

37:49.059 --> 37:52.436
And I screamed at him and I shook him.

37:53.980 --> 37:55.814
And he was dead.

37:57.525 --> 37:58.984
Just dead.

38:02.906 --> 38:04.615
A man ran over.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.620
He had a fish tattoo on his face.

38:11.539 --> 38:13.582
In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos.

38:13.667 --> 38:17.044
So you know what they are
without having to talk to them.

38:17.337 --> 38:20.130
And this man worked on a fishing boat.

38:20.215 --> 38:22.633
And he pushed me out of the way.

38:23.635 --> 38:28.347
You have to understand,
for a slave to push a highborn girl,

38:28.431 --> 38:31.558
that's death for the man, a terrible death.

38:32.978 --> 38:35.312
But he pushed me out of the way,

38:36.606 --> 38:40.734
and he started pressing on my brother's chest

38:40.819 --> 38:44.321
again and again and again,

38:45.031 --> 38:48.492
until my brother spat out

38:48.576 --> 38:52.079
half of the Rhoyne and cried out.

38:52.163 --> 38:55.791
And the man cradled his head
and told him to be calm.

39:02.424 --> 39:04.675
I decided two things that day.

39:04.759 --> 39:10.264
I would not waste my years planning dances
and masquerades with the other noble ladies.

39:11.307 --> 39:13.767
And when I came of age,

39:15.353 --> 39:18.188
I would never live in a slave city again.

39:25.447 --> 39:26.947
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

39:27.032 --> 39:30.367
You told me of your problems
and I've blathered on.

39:30.452 --> 39:33.203
I don't want to marry the Frey girl.

39:36.833 --> 39:38.125
I don't want you to marry her.

39:42.130 --> 39:44.298
But you needed that bridge.

39:46.968 --> 39:48.969
I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.

40:55.203 --> 40:57.454
The sour cherries
was all crushed up and ready.

40:57.539 --> 40:58.622
Shut up.

40:58.706 --> 41:01.542
Probably in the piecrust by now.
In the oven.

41:02.752 --> 41:04.044
The nice, warm oven.

41:04.129 --> 41:06.255
Shut up. What did you bring?

41:06.840 --> 41:09.133
The cheese could be better.

41:09.217 --> 41:10.676
I did get some nice sausages.

41:10.760 --> 41:13.303
What did he want us
to do about those guards?

41:13.388 --> 41:14.888
He didn't say.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.640
He just said, "Walk through the gates."

41:16.724 --> 41:17.850
What about the guards?

41:17.934 --> 41:19.810
He didn't say anything about the guards.

41:19.894 --> 41:21.478
What, he left that bit out?

41:21.563 --> 41:23.105
It's a pretty important part, don't you think?

41:23.731 --> 41:25.274
We have to trust him.

41:25.358 --> 41:26.441
Trust him?

41:26.526 --> 41:29.653
You trusted him to fight with us
when you set him free and he ran.

41:29.737 --> 41:31.697
- I want to go back to the kitchens.
- Shut up.

41:31.990 --> 41:34.074
Stay here if you're afraid.

41:36.911 --> 41:38.453
Arry, don't.

42:07.275 --> 42:08.400
Away!

42:08.484 --> 42:09.776
Reset!

42:18.077 --> 42:21.121
If the wind holds,
we'll reach King's Landing in a day.

42:21.206 --> 42:22.539
Will it hold?

42:22.916 --> 42:25.918
Can't make promises for the wind,
Your Grace.

42:26.711 --> 42:28.378
Again, pull!

42:32.008 --> 42:34.218
I admire you, Ser Davos.

42:34.302 --> 42:37.512
I thank you, Your Grace. Pleased to hear it.

42:37.597 --> 42:41.558
Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight
and think they insult you.

42:41.643 --> 42:43.894
So you take the onion for your sigil,

42:43.978 --> 42:46.396
sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag.

42:46.481 --> 42:48.440
My son wishes me to change it.

42:48.524 --> 42:51.818
Three mermen with tridents,
something like that.

42:51.903 --> 42:55.906
I understand why
the older families look down at me.

42:55.990 --> 42:57.908
Do you? Why?

42:57.992 --> 43:00.953
- My father was a crabber.
- And?

43:01.037 --> 43:05.040
Well, sons of lords don't like
to break bread with sons of crabbers.

43:05.124 --> 43:06.583
Our hands stink.

43:06.668 --> 43:09.044
And where were those lords
when Storm's End starved?

43:09.545 --> 43:11.546
Many fought bravely for your brother.

43:11.631 --> 43:14.258
Many fought for the Mad King.

43:14.342 --> 43:17.719
You defend these men
who insult you behind your back.

43:18.638 --> 43:20.472
Some are happy to do it to my face.

43:20.556 --> 43:22.432
We were forgotten.

43:22.892 --> 43:25.227
Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes.

43:25.311 --> 43:29.398
The glorious rebels
marching from battle to battle,

43:29.482 --> 43:31.692
liberating towns
from the yoke of the Mad King,

43:31.776 --> 43:34.111
while I held Storm's End with 500 men.

43:34.195 --> 43:36.613
- No one has forgotten, Your Grace.
- No? Robert did.

43:36.698 --> 43:39.908
He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war.
Renly never fought a day in his life.

43:39.993 --> 43:43.537
- He was only a boy.
- Then why'd he give him Storm's End?

43:46.791 --> 43:48.834
First, we ate the horses.

43:48.918 --> 43:52.462
We weren't riding anywhere,
not with the castle surrounded.

43:52.547 --> 43:54.631
We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses.

43:54.716 --> 43:57.968
Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine.

43:58.052 --> 43:59.803
I do like dogs.

43:59.887 --> 44:03.432
Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them.
Then the rats.

44:04.559 --> 44:07.644
The night before you slipped through,
I thought my wife was dying.

44:07.729 --> 44:09.938
She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail.

44:11.190 --> 44:13.483
And then you made it through the lines.

44:13.568 --> 44:16.820
Slipped right through
in your little black sailboat with your onions.

44:16.904 --> 44:19.656
And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe.

44:19.741 --> 44:21.992
Every man in Storm's End wanted
to kiss you that night.

44:22.076 --> 44:24.369
I was relieved they did not.

44:26.748 --> 44:29.916
Robert told me to hold Storm's End,
so I held it.

44:31.419 --> 44:34.421
Then he told me he was giving it to Renly,
so I gave it up.

44:34.922 --> 44:37.215
Insult or no, I gave it up.

44:37.300 --> 44:39.176
Because Robert was my older brother,
and he was the king

44:39.260 --> 44:41.345
and I've always done my duty.

44:41.804 --> 44:45.682
But now, I'm the rightful king
by every law of Westeros.

44:45.767 --> 44:47.809
And when I sit the Iron Throne,
you'll be my Hand.

44:51.022 --> 44:52.564
Your Grace,

44:54.942 --> 44:56.943
I pray I serve you well.

44:58.279 --> 45:00.781
I expect you'll be the first crabber's son
to wear the badge.

45:05.912 --> 45:09.289
You're the Master of Whisperers.
You're supposed to know everything.

45:09.374 --> 45:12.334
No man can be in all rooms at all times.

45:12.418 --> 45:15.212
I have many little birds in the North, my lord,

45:15.296 --> 45:19.716
but I haven't heard their songs
since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.

45:19.801 --> 45:23.595
The Stark forces are distracted.
Now is the time to strike.

45:23.679 --> 45:25.305
To strike?

45:25.390 --> 45:29.017
My dear nephew, you do see these men
preparing the walls for siege?

45:29.102 --> 45:32.646
You do understand
Stannis Baratheon sails this way?

45:32.730 --> 45:35.023
If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores
of King's Landing,

45:35.108 --> 45:36.900
I'll ride out to greet him.

45:36.984 --> 45:38.819
A brave choice, Your Grace.

45:38.903 --> 45:41.655
I'm sure your men will line up behind you.

45:41.948 --> 45:44.991
They say Stannis never smiles.

45:45.076 --> 45:47.494
I'll give him a red smile

45:47.578 --> 45:49.287
from ear to ear.

45:54.085 --> 45:56.294
Imagine Stannis' terror.

45:57.338 --> 45:58.839
I am trying.

46:00.341 --> 46:01.925
You're an intelligent man.

46:02.009 --> 46:03.635
I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.

46:03.719 --> 46:07.514
Oh, no one disputes that, my lord,
not even the multitudes who despise you.

46:07.849 --> 46:10.517
I wish we could converse
as two honest, intelligent men.

46:10.601 --> 46:12.185
I wish we could, too.

46:14.730 --> 46:16.356
What do you want?

46:16.732 --> 46:18.150
Tell me.

46:19.026 --> 46:22.362
If we're going to play, you'll have to start.

46:27.160 --> 46:30.704
My brother was
the youngest Kingsguard in history.

46:31.873 --> 46:34.749
My sister became queen at the age of 19.

46:36.878 --> 46:38.670
When I reached manhood,

46:38.754 --> 46:42.507
my father put me in charge of all the drains
and cisterns in Casterly Rock.

46:42.758 --> 46:44.759
A most highborn plumber.

46:44.844 --> 46:46.803
The water never flowed better.

46:46.888 --> 46:49.639
And all the shit found its way to the sea.

46:50.057 --> 46:52.726
I never expected to have any real power.

46:52.810 --> 46:54.728
So when my father named me acting Hand...

46:54.812 --> 46:56.730
You're quite good at being Hand, you know?

46:57.064 --> 46:59.900
Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men.

46:59.984 --> 47:01.985
Honorable men.

47:02.069 --> 47:04.863
But they disdained the game
and those who played.

47:04.947 --> 47:07.199
- You enjoy the game.
- I do.

47:08.326 --> 47:09.868
Last thing I expected.

47:09.952 --> 47:11.286
And you play it well.

47:11.370 --> 47:13.497
I'd like to keep playing it.

47:16.083 --> 47:19.127
If Stannis breaches the gates,
the game is over.

47:19.212 --> 47:23.131
They say he burns his enemies alive
to honor the Lord of Light.

47:24.258 --> 47:26.009
The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned,

47:26.093 --> 47:28.678
the Drowned God wants them drowned.

47:28.763 --> 47:30.597
Why are all the gods such vicious cunts?

47:31.766 --> 47:34.309
Where is the god of tits and wine?

47:34.977 --> 47:39.105
In the Summer lsles,
they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats.

47:39.690 --> 47:42.108
We should sail there immediately.

47:43.778 --> 47:46.363
This morning, I heard a song

47:47.198 --> 47:50.283
all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste.

47:50.868 --> 47:52.285
Daenerys Targaryen lives.

47:54.205 --> 47:57.249
A girl at the edge of the world
is the least of our problems.

47:57.333 --> 47:59.251
She has three dragons.

48:01.170 --> 48:03.338
But even if what they say is true,

48:03.422 --> 48:06.299
it'll be years before they are fully grown.

48:06.926 --> 48:09.636
And then there will be nowhere to hide.

48:10.680 --> 48:12.347
One game at a time, my friend.

48:22.900 --> 48:24.901
Careful, Khaleesi.

48:24.986 --> 48:29.447
Xaro owns this city and the warlocks
have a thousand eyes watching for you.

48:30.908 --> 48:32.367
I found one.

48:33.202 --> 48:35.453
A ship with a good captain.

48:35.538 --> 48:37.247
She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.

48:37.331 --> 48:38.707
Astapor?

48:38.791 --> 48:40.041
We cannot stay here.

48:40.126 --> 48:43.253
They have my dragons.
A mother does not flee without her children.

48:43.337 --> 48:45.297
They're not your children.

48:46.257 --> 48:49.134
I know they call you the Mother of Dragons
and I know you love them,

48:49.218 --> 48:50.760
but you didn't grow them in your womb.

48:50.845 --> 48:53.305
They didn't suckle at your breast.
They are dragons, Khaleesi.

48:53.806 --> 48:55.807
And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die.

48:55.891 --> 48:59.519
You should sail to Astapor.
I'm sure you'll be safe there.

49:01.689 --> 49:03.940
You know I would die for you.

49:04.900 --> 49:07.319
I will never abandon you.

49:07.403 --> 49:09.404
I'm sworn to protect you, to serve.

49:09.488 --> 49:11.531
Then serve me.

49:11.616 --> 49:15.160
If my dragons are in
the House of the Undying, then take me there.

49:15.244 --> 49:17.120
That's what the warlock wants.

49:17.204 --> 49:18.830
He told you so himself.

49:18.914 --> 49:21.708
If you enter that place,
you will never leave again.

49:21.792 --> 49:24.794
- His magic is strong.
- And what of my magic?

49:24.879 --> 49:27.881
You saw me step into the fire.
You watched the witch burn.

49:27.965 --> 49:31.176
What did the flames do to me?
Do you remember?

49:33.137 --> 49:35.930
Until my last breath, I will remember.

49:38.017 --> 49:40.727
After I have forgotten my mother's face.

49:45.483 --> 49:47.317
They are my children.

49:48.402 --> 49:51.863
And they are the only children I will ever have.

49:58.120 --> 49:59.746
Take me to them.

50:12.093 --> 50:13.885
We should bury them.

50:14.637 --> 50:17.931
I'd leave 'em up a few more days.
Sends a message.

50:18.933 --> 50:21.267
If they haven't got the damn message yet,
a few more days won't help.

50:22.436 --> 50:23.978
As you say.

50:24.063 --> 50:27.232
But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer.

50:27.983 --> 50:31.111
- What's this?
- Gold for the farmer.

50:31.612 --> 50:33.238
For his trouble.

50:34.115 --> 50:35.240
His troubles are done.

50:36.575 --> 50:38.702
He's feeding the crops now.

50:38.953 --> 50:40.453
His wife, too.

50:42.623 --> 50:45.709
You want to keep a man silent,
you silence him.

51:04.979 --> 51:07.981
Got as far
as the farm and then doubled back.

51:10.401 --> 51:13.611
Walked through the stream
to throw off the hounds.

51:15.656 --> 51:19.159
Hoped this would be the last place
they'd think to look.

51:21.120 --> 51:22.787
You're right

51:22.872 --> 51:24.330
so far.

51:25.958 --> 51:29.169
Who was that
out there hung up at the gates?

51:31.088 --> 51:33.590
Must have been the farmer's boys.

51:34.842 --> 51:37.051
He killed them and burned them

51:38.679 --> 51:41.431
and passed them off as the little lords?

51:42.850 --> 51:44.517
They mustn't know.

51:45.853 --> 51:48.354
Bran would blame himself.

51:48.439 --> 51:50.315
They'll never hear it from me.

51:51.984 --> 51:54.569
The little lads have suffered enough.
