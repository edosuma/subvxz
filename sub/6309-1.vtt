Village? You didn't mention any village.

02:48.832 --> 02:52.751
I know. That's because
the Temple's the best bit.

02:52.803 --> 02:55.754
Death traps, possibly even mummies.

02:55.806 --> 02:58.890
- You know how I love mummies.
- Almost too much.

02:58.925 --> 03:01.342
- You can't love mummies too much.
- Okay, but we need recon.

03:01.344 --> 03:03.261
Do these villagers know about the temple?

03:12.356 --> 03:14.890
They probably noticed when
you made the volcano erupt!

- Absolutely not!

03:28.705 --> 03:30.572
Yes, 'cause we got the Idol of Agamanzo.

03:30.624 --> 03:33.041
No, we were not supposed to
just open up secret passages,

03:33.076 --> 03:35.827
setting off alarms leading
to, you know, volcano.

03:35.879 --> 03:38.663
Secret passages that led
to Idol of Agamanzo, Eve,

The Library made more Librarians than ever,

03:43.504 --> 03:45.053

- Eve...
- Maybe we should check on them.

03:46.757 --> 03:48.723
Don't worry. They're out there that way,

you brought it back from the void.

05:03.173 --> 05:05.140

you'll create a dimensional inversion

05:07.060 --> 05:08.977

05:15.852 --> 05:18.671
but, uh, I'm afraid I cannot
support your conclusions.

05:20.107 --> 05:22.824

that was donated to the
museum, a set from Milan.

09:28.151 --> 09:29.817

about the new high-frequency
weather sonar equipment

09:42.215 --> 09:44.081
Huh. Well, let's pool our resources and...

09:44.133 --> 09:45.833
Or we could just each do our own job.

09:45.885 --> 09:48.802
O... okay, what is this?

09:48.908 --> 09:50.207
Oh, I mean, no offense,

09:50.243 --> 09:51.959
but I've been doing the Librarian thing

09:51.994 --> 09:53.210
solo for a while now.

- [Normal voice] I kinda got my own style.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.885
- Oh.
- Yeah, and I'm just very focused on...

10:01.921 --> 10:04.922
They're Librarians. This is what they do.

10:04.974 --> 10:07.391
Off, the lot of you. Divide and conquer.

10:07.426 --> 10:09.310
Okay. This worries me.

- This way you and I...
- Uh... [Clears throat]

- [Microphone thuds]
- [Amplified voice] Uh, ladies and gentlemen,

10:12.770 --> 10:14.270
I've been asked to forward

10:14.305 --> 10:18.190
that due to some rather
rapid and extreme flooding,

10:18.226 --> 10:20.693
the streets are being kept clear

10:20.728 --> 10:23.395
in order to evacuate the
lower lying areas of Manhattan.

10:23.397 --> 10:25.814
No vehicle will be allowed on the streets.

10:25.866 --> 10:28.817
So unfortunately, we will not
be allowing anyone to leave.

10:28.869 --> 10:32.071
Now I'm sure this is temporary,
and there's no cause for alarm,

10:32.907 --> 10:35.074
as the museum is all perfectly safe.

10:35.076 --> 10:37.660
- [Thunder crashes]

Yes, you just go out
that door, make a left...

11:29.297 --> 11:32.097
You have 30 seconds to be interesting.

11:32.133 --> 11:35.184
I like your earrings.
Are they, uh, antiques?

11:35.219 --> 11:36.935
You opened with a question.

11:36.971 --> 11:40.356
Rare enough among men
to pique my curiosity.

11:40.391 --> 11:41.974
Yes, thank you.

11:42.026 --> 11:44.226
They've been in my family for centuries.

blah, blah, earrings.</i>

11:47.815 --> 11:50.699
They have a name... <i>gli occhi scintillanti.</i>

11:50.735 --> 11:54.203
Ah, and, uh, do you have a name?

11:54.238 --> 11:55.738
You're growing less interesting.

11:58.409 --> 11:59.875
Ah.

11:59.910 --> 12:02.878
Hi, I'm a Librarian. I'm here to get...

12:02.913 --> 12:04.330
[Breathing heavily]

12:04.382 --> 12:06.999
Hi, I'm a Librarian.
I'm here to gather data

12:07.001 --> 12:09.718
on weather patterns in metropolitan areas.

12:09.754 --> 12:11.503
Hi, I'm a Libr...

12:11.505 --> 12:13.839
Hi, okay. Hi, I'm a Librarian.

12:13.891 --> 12:15.424
Get out while you can!

12:15.476 --> 12:17.343
Isn't it kinda weird to
leave a weather station

12:17.395 --> 12:19.178
when there's a really cool storm happening?

12:19.230 --> 12:21.980
By "cool storm," you mean
freak nightmare cyclone

12:22.016 --> 12:23.899
that's gonna rip this little half-shell

12:23.934 --> 12:26.018
right off the roof of
this building then, no.

12:26.020 --> 12:28.904
- Not weird at all.
- Okay, I... I...

12:28.939 --> 12:32.008
- Save yourself!
- Okay.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.777
I don't suppose anyone wants to tell me

12:34.829 --> 12:36.111
where the new sonar is.

12:36.163 --> 12:39.498
[Thunder crashes, electricity powers down]

12:39.533 --> 12:41.917
And... perfect.

12:41.952 --> 12:43.202
Checking these artifacts may take a while.

12:43.204 --> 12:44.536
Maybe we should ask for some help.

12:44.538 --> 12:46.038
I don't need any help.

12:46.090 --> 12:47.873
Background information, research, planning,

12:47.875 --> 12:49.375
useful trinkets of...

12:49.427 --> 12:52.761
Excuse me. Do you know who
put this display together?

12:52.797 --> 12:55.514
No need. It's this gentleman here.

12:55.549 --> 12:56.882
Mr. James Worth,

12:56.934 --> 12:58.217
visiting Professor of antiquities

12:58.269 --> 12:59.885
from Oxford University.

12:59.937 --> 13:03.456
Well done. Marvelous trick.
Tell me, how did you do it?

13:04.108 --> 13:05.891
Well, elementary, actually.

13:05.943 --> 13:08.444
I noticed your London accent
when you made the announcement

13:08.479 --> 13:10.062
about the weather, and I
couldn't help but to notice

13:10.064 --> 13:11.230
that you have a little
baby powder on your hands

13:11.282 --> 13:12.481
and on your sleeve.

13:12.533 --> 13:14.233
Baby powder on the hands, making it easier

13:14.285 --> 13:15.451
to remove the tight latex gloves

13:15.486 --> 13:17.069
often worn by artifact restorers.

13:17.071 --> 13:18.904
Now you might be part of the research team,

13:18.956 --> 13:20.873
but you're circulating among the guests,

13:20.908 --> 13:22.541
which implies that you're
in a position of authority.

13:22.576 --> 13:24.910
When I glanced at the
placard, which lists everyone

13:24.962 --> 13:26.545
who worked on the project,

13:26.580 --> 13:28.414
only one scientist graduated
from a British university...

13:28.416 --> 13:30.799
Oxford, in fact Mr. James Worth.

13:30.835 --> 13:32.918
Amazing.<i> Amazing.</i>

13:32.970 --> 13:36.472
- [Sighs]
- Flynn Carsen, Librarian.

13:36.507 --> 13:38.557
I'm sorry, what with the who now?

13:38.592 --> 13:40.175
As you entered,

13:40.227 --> 13:43.095
you glanced past the rather
gaudy Alexandrine vase

13:43.097 --> 13:46.064
to admire the more subtle, yet much rarer,

13:46.100 --> 13:49.785
Mesopotamian broach, revealing
you are a man of deep education.

13:50.237 --> 13:52.855
A mere scholar? No.

13:52.907 --> 13:55.574
Your kerchief is out of a
style handmade in Tripoli.

13:55.609 --> 13:58.160
You have the distinctive
sun damage of a man

13:58.195 --> 14:01.330
who spent time in the Himalayas,
and yet, I do believe that

14:01.365 --> 14:03.832
is a bit of Australian
red dirt on your shoes.

14:03.868 --> 14:06.118
Sun damage? I moisturize.

14:06.170 --> 14:07.619
So... a traveler.

14:07.621 --> 14:11.173
But you have multiple small
burns on your left hand,

14:11.208 --> 14:13.459
the type I generally see on scientists

14:13.511 --> 14:16.462
from grabbing a test tube
prematurely off burners.

14:16.464 --> 14:18.347
Ha! I've seen you do that!

14:18.382 --> 14:21.951
And your pin is the symbol
for calculus integration,

14:22.603 --> 14:25.604
chosen for your fondness, I deduce,

14:25.639 --> 14:27.389
- in physics and mathematics.
- [Mouths words]

14:27.441 --> 14:30.642
A man with such a wide
range of specialities,

14:30.644 --> 14:34.530
traveling the world, could be anyone.

14:34.565 --> 14:35.981
I lip-read that woman.

14:36.033 --> 14:37.366
[Mouths words]

14:37.401 --> 14:39.234
Yes, I can.

14:39.286 --> 14:42.488
That woman asked you where
the Japanese art room was.

14:42.540 --> 14:44.957
You directed her to the East Wing.

14:44.992 --> 14:46.875
But it was moved to the West Wing

14:46.911 --> 14:48.577
shortly after the pyramid display

14:48.629 --> 14:50.162
was completed 10 years ago,

14:50.164 --> 14:53.165
implying, of course,
that you knew the museum

14:53.167 --> 14:54.583
when you worked on that display,

14:54.635 --> 14:57.135
but never returned after it was complete.

14:57.171 --> 14:59.888
Infamously, there was
one brilliant polymath

14:59.924 --> 15:03.175
who worked on that display
who disappeared shortly after.

15:03.177 --> 15:04.593
One Flynn Carsen.

15:04.645 --> 15:07.346
[Laughs] The Librarian part?

15:07.398 --> 15:11.350
Ah, beeswax used in the
restoration of rare books.

15:11.352 --> 15:15.020
- Left lapel. He rubs his fingers these absently while working.
- [Exhales]

15:15.022 --> 15:17.356
- Elementary, my dear Carsen.
- [Exhales deeply]

15:17.438 --> 15:20.358
And you, I deduce... are a Duchess.

15:23.410 --> 15:26.612
- Really?
- Or the assembled royalty.

15:26.614 --> 15:29.281
And yet, you outshine them all.

15:30.784 --> 15:33.619
You call that a deduction? [Laughs]

15:33.671 --> 15:37.005
She's not a Duchess.
She's an ordinary person.

15:37.041 --> 15:39.124
Her accent should've
given it away like that.

15:39.126 --> 15:42.511
Well, my mistake then.
You have outdone me, sir.

15:43.263 --> 15:45.464
You were inquiring about the background

15:45.466 --> 15:46.798
of some of the artifacts.

15:46.850 --> 15:49.601
Yes, please. Thank you.

15:51.138 --> 15:53.722
[Whispering] Lipreading's not that hard.

15:53.774 --> 15:55.557
I can do it.

15:55.609 --> 15:59.211
Those two women over there...
"Where are the snuffy pom poms?"

15:59.647 --> 16:03.532
"I've never circled square
Idaho in the blueberry cupcake."

16:04.068 --> 16:05.450
Nothing to it. [Snaps fingers]

16:07.154 --> 16:10.555
[Switch clicks, electricity whirs]

16:10.591 --> 16:12.691
Yes!

16:12.726 --> 16:15.661
Oh, megastorm, not kidding.

16:15.713 --> 16:18.213
- [Thunderclap]
- [Sonar beeping]

16:18.248 --> 16:20.215
There is the new sonar.

16:21.468 --> 16:23.669
Oh.

16:23.671 --> 16:27.222
[Loud whooshing]

16:31.762 --> 16:34.262
[Screeching whoosh]

16:34.314 --> 16:35.681
[Gasps]

16:38.102 --> 16:40.185
[Loud whooshing continues]

16:40.237 --> 16:43.157
It's... in the storm.

16:50.996 --> 16:53.663
[Roaring sound]

16:53.699 --> 16:55.248
Mr. Jenkins, are you getting this?

16:55.284 --> 16:59.035
<i>[Roaring]</i>

16:59.087 --> 17:01.204
Yes, indeed. Very odd.

17:01.256 --> 17:03.373
[Sighs] There's no mathematical constant

17:03.425 --> 17:05.040
that I can derive from the waveform

17:05.093 --> 17:06.376
that would give us a
clue to what's causing it.

17:06.428 --> 17:08.962
<i>Miss Cillian, do me a favor.</i>

17:09.013 --> 17:11.047
Just put aside your
logic and your mathematics

17:11.049 --> 17:12.432
for a moment.

17:12.467 --> 17:14.217
What? No. [Chuckles]

17:14.219 --> 17:17.103
I like my math and logic.
They help me sleep at night.

17:17.138 --> 17:18.555
They're like a teddy bear. [Chuckles]

17:18.607 --> 17:20.190
I mean, like a teddy bear made of

17:20.224 --> 17:21.585
isosceles triangles and electrons.

17:21.609 --> 17:25.095
Yes, yes, yes, I know. But just listen.

17:25.731 --> 17:28.064
<i>What does that sound like to you?</i>

17:28.116 --> 17:31.651
- It sounds...
- [Wind howling loudly]

17:31.703 --> 17:33.203
Sad.

17:35.073 --> 17:36.573
<i>Precisely.</i>

17:36.625 --> 17:39.075
Oh, good. Hey, did you find
what you were looking for?

17:39.127 --> 17:42.128
- Uh, maybe. I don't know.
- Listen, do me a favor, would you?

17:42.164 --> 17:44.247
Can you write down the,
uh, relative densities

17:44.249 --> 17:46.549
of ivory, onyx, gypsum,
any... any... any stone

17:46.585 --> 17:49.469
you might think somebody'd
make a chess piece out of.

17:49.504 --> 17:51.721
You could look this up on your own.

17:51.757 --> 17:55.175
Yeah, but you're faster than the internet.

17:55.227 --> 17:57.227
You know that.

17:59.431 --> 18:00.597
[Thunder rumbles]

18:00.649 --> 18:03.266
Oh, hey, uh, could you write down

18:03.318 --> 18:05.402
some Italian cultural... stuff?

18:05.437 --> 18:08.405
You know, paintings, poems
by those poncy lads you like.

18:08.440 --> 18:11.274
I'm trying to make some
headway with the Italian bird,

18:11.326 --> 18:13.610
get a shot at her earrings,
but I'm getting nowhere.

18:18.500 --> 18:22.169
Why did we stop doing
this? Huh? Working together?

18:22.704 --> 18:26.590
Because you kept ordering me around.

18:27.292 --> 18:29.459
I wasn't... I'm not... I
wasn't ordering you around.

18:29.511 --> 18:32.128
I was trying to get you to
stick to the plan, Jones!

18:32.180 --> 18:33.546
Yeah, by ordering me around.

18:33.598 --> 18:35.298
And then Cassandra kept taking your side...

18:35.300 --> 18:38.268
What? No. No, I just tried to
get you two to stop arguing.

18:38.303 --> 18:40.122
Blame it on her again?
Man, that's the whole thing.

18:40.123 --> 18:41.400
No, I'm not blaming her.
I'm blaming both of you...

18:41.405 --> 18:43.306
- You never take responsibility for your own...
- Guys, guys, guys. We're doing it again.

18:43.358 --> 18:46.109
We worked so well together at the Library.

18:46.144 --> 18:49.145
Why couldn't we do it
when we were on our own?

18:49.147 --> 18:50.780
Like something was missing.

18:50.816 --> 18:53.566
[Thunderclap]

18:53.618 --> 18:57.487
The <i> Isola Perduta,</i> it went
down after visiting five ports

18:57.489 --> 18:59.155
in the Mediterranean.

18:59.207 --> 19:01.992
So its cargo is a wondrous
mix of European products

19:01.994 --> 19:03.660
from the 1600s.

19:03.782 --> 19:05.565
Which seems a little odd given the fact

19:05.617 --> 19:07.233
of a ship of this tonnage

19:07.235 --> 19:08.785
would just be tooling
around the Mediterranean.

19:08.820 --> 19:11.371
Excuse me. I have not seen
anything out of the ordinary

19:11.406 --> 19:13.406
or anything that could
be causing this storm.

19:13.458 --> 19:15.408
[Lowered voice] You might wanna ask James.

19:15.410 --> 19:16.910
He seems very informed.

19:16.912 --> 19:20.713
- Professor Worth, that is a bottle of rum.
- So it is.

19:20.749 --> 19:22.582
English rum.

19:22.634 --> 19:24.134
The <i> Isola Perduta</i> didn't
just sail the Mediterranean,

19:24.169 --> 19:26.252
it went to England as I suspected.

19:26.304 --> 19:27.754
It had English cargo.

19:27.806 --> 19:30.223
That would explain why we've
had difficulty identifying

19:30.224 --> 19:32.168
- some of the artifacts.
- Oh, you've had difficulty

19:32.189 --> 19:33.162
identifying some of the artifacts.

19:33.184 --> 19:35.735
[Slaps hand] Well, don't take it so hard.

19:35.770 --> 19:38.554
I would be happy to assist.
Where is the ship's manifest?

19:38.826 --> 19:42.445
In the archive room, along
with the rest of the artifacts.

19:44.415 --> 19:46.365
I'm so sorry. I didn't
mean to distract him.

19:46.417 --> 19:48.250
Oh, he's kind of permanently distracted.

19:48.286 --> 19:49.785
Anyway, do you know anything

19:49.787 --> 19:51.420
about this famous chess set from Milan?

19:51.456 --> 19:55.225
A bit. How about I educate
you over some drinks?

19:56.661 --> 19:58.377
Oh, thanks, man.

19:58.412 --> 20:00.246
Thank <i> you,</i> Terry.

20:00.298 --> 20:03.999
So you're doing work during a party?

20:04.001 --> 20:06.085
You're one dedicated fella.

20:08.139 --> 20:09.889
Ah, dropped your book.

20:09.924 --> 20:12.341
Oh, no, it's not mine. I...
I found it upstairs outside.

20:12.393 --> 20:14.176
Just leave it for lost and found.

20:14.228 --> 20:17.229
[Thunder rumbling]

20:24.622 --> 20:26.623
Hello.

20:29.361 --> 20:32.445
[Laughs] Absolutely my favorite art style.

20:32.497 --> 20:33.947
I'm cuckoo for rococo.

20:33.949 --> 20:37.584
You have proven far more
amusing than I thought possible.

20:37.619 --> 20:39.452
Well, take a stroll then?

20:39.454 --> 20:41.704
And you're predictable again.

20:41.756 --> 20:45.291
Just for once, I want a man
to genuinely surprise me.

20:45.343 --> 20:48.962
My mates and I are actually
about to rob the museum.

20:48.964 --> 20:51.965
Would you like to, uh,
see some American crime?

20:54.519 --> 20:56.803
[Chuckles] So, Duchess...

20:56.855 --> 20:58.471
[Laughs]

20:58.523 --> 21:00.440
You work with Dr. Carsen?

21:00.475 --> 21:03.526
I do now. I was with a team before.

21:03.562 --> 21:04.894
Why are you no longer with them?

21:04.946 --> 21:07.480
I'm not sure they need me anymore.

21:07.532 --> 21:09.699
Eve, you can't let others define you.

21:09.734 --> 21:12.819
You know who you are.
You know what you can do.

21:12.821 --> 21:15.205
Do it and damn the consequences.

21:15.240 --> 21:16.823
- Great advice, James.
- Mm.

21:16.875 --> 21:18.491
[Glasses clink]

21:18.493 --> 21:21.628
Mmm, speaking of, I
think I should go and see

21:21.663 --> 21:24.380
- if your Dr. Carsen needs any help.
- Mm.

21:24.416 --> 21:25.999
I shall return.

21:29.387 --> 21:31.638
[Phone beeps, keys clack]

21:31.673 --> 21:34.757
[Indistinct conversations]

21:34.809 --> 21:36.593
[Woman speaking Italian]

21:36.645 --> 21:39.012
[Speaks Italian]

21:39.014 --> 21:42.682
- <i>Me escuse. Vorrei farle alcune domande.</i>
- Eh?

21:42.684 --> 21:45.235
[Clack, thunder rumbles]

21:45.270 --> 21:47.937
Well, I found the thing that
doesn't belong... this chest.

21:47.989 --> 21:49.689
It was picked up in London in 1611

21:49.691 --> 21:51.574
and then shipped to a monastery in Rome.

21:51.610 --> 21:53.993
Yeah. That thing, yes, deuced challenge.

21:54.029 --> 21:55.945
No x-rays seem to penetrate it.

21:55.997 --> 21:58.031
Can't seem to open the damn thing.

21:58.033 --> 22:01.451
Yes, that's because it has a sigil.

26:10.884 --> 26:12.217
Well, Moriarty's doing just fine.

26:12.219 --> 26:13.518
He got himself a fake identity,

26:13.554 --> 26:15.137
set himself up to collect all the pieces.

26:15.189 --> 26:16.772

26:16.807 --> 26:18.974
Well, I would posit, sir,
that Moriarty had help.

26:19.026 --> 26:20.475
There are two types of Fictionals.

26:20.527 --> 26:22.277
Someone summoned him from this book.

26:22.312 --> 26:25.147
They called him into this world.

26:25.199 --> 26:28.283
- And the other kind?
- Much older. Much more powerful.

26:28.318 --> 26:31.787
Iconic characters whose stories
are so well told, so famous,

26:31.822 --> 26:33.772

emerge into this reality

26:33.774 --> 26:36.124

26:36.160 --> 26:38.460
Mostly hidden. Not very many of those.

26:38.495 --> 26:41.246
So there was another
Fictional at the party.

26:41.298 --> 26:43.165
I just have to figure out who.

26:43.217 --> 26:45.133
Sir, beware, Fictionals are bound,

26:45.169 --> 26:47.803
but also empowered by their stories.

26:47.838 --> 26:50.222
You could trap them within
the rules of their own tales.

26:50.257 --> 26:52.174
But they can be extremely powerful

26:52.226 --> 26:55.510
if their narrative matches the real world.

26:55.562 --> 26:58.013
Your mystery villain may
be trying to gather parts

26:58.065 --> 27:00.265
- of his story to gain strength.
- To what end?

27:00.267 --> 27:03.518

character you're dealing with.

32:51.134 --> 32:54.519
- [Thunderclap]
- O my sprite!

32:54.554 --> 32:57.223
Descend and serve again thy master

32:59.225 --> 33:01.142
bound till I release thee.

33:01.194 --> 33:03.364
Come hither, Ariel!

33:08.451 --> 33:12.153
My word is bond, fair island fey.

33:12.205 --> 33:14.739
Obey and take us far away.

33:14.791 --> 33:16.824
[Whoosh]

33:16.876 --> 33:18.743
With me, villain!

33:18.795 --> 33:20.628
- Villain?
- [Whoosh]

33:20.663 --> 33:22.413
I always preferred antagonist.

33:23.633 --> 33:25.833
[Whoosh]

33:28.254 --> 33:29.587
[Yells] What are you doing?

33:29.589 --> 33:31.506
I gotta get after them before it closes!

33:31.558 --> 33:34.258
- You are not following them alone.
- Well, then, jump with me!

33:34.260 --> 33:37.395
Oh. Oh, great. Now they can
be anywhere in the world.

33:37.430 --> 33:39.263
We have a bigger problem.

33:39.315 --> 33:41.819
- What could be a bigger problem than...
- [Thunder crashing]

33:47.857 --> 33:49.740
[Whoosh]

33:49.776 --> 33:51.609
Good, you made it out of the city.

33:51.611 --> 33:53.361
Well, we can go through
the door, but that leaves

33:53.413 --> 33:54.662
7 million people stuck in Hurricane Ariel.

33:54.697 --> 33:56.280
Why hasn't that storm stopped

33:56.282 --> 33:57.782
now that its fairy engine is gone?

33:57.784 --> 34:00.201
Because a storm of that
magnitude is self-sustaining.

34:00.253 --> 34:02.169
Ariel brought it to
New York, controlled it,

34:02.205 --> 34:04.338
but it's actually far more
dangerous with him gone.

34:04.374 --> 34:05.790
Him gone? Her gone?

34:05.842 --> 34:07.592
Ariel's been presented
both male and female. I...

34:07.627 --> 34:09.260
Focusing, focusing.

34:09.295 --> 34:10.710
It takes in hot air

34:10.763 --> 34:12.797
and distributes cold
air, like it's breathing.

34:12.799 --> 34:14.715
And it will dissipate, but when it does,

34:14.766 --> 34:16.217
it's gonna spin off tornados

34:16.268 --> 34:17.802
just to get rid of the kinetic energy.

34:17.853 --> 34:21.472
So whatever's not flooded
gets shredded. Aces!

34:21.524 --> 34:24.275
- Prospero?
- He got away. It's nobody's fault.

34:24.310 --> 34:25.943
It's Eve's fault, but let's move on.

34:25.978 --> 34:26.828
The important thing now is to figure out

34:26.864 --> 34:28.464
how to stop this storm. How do we do it?

34:28.735 --> 34:30.318
People don't have great track records

34:30.370 --> 34:32.402
at stopping hurricanes.

34:32.455 --> 34:34.739
Well, they haven't had the resources
of the Library. [Snaps fingers]

34:34.791 --> 34:36.407
Zeus's lightning bolt.

34:36.458 --> 34:38.409
Destructive, but not
nearly large scale enough.

34:38.460 --> 34:40.911
Could we blow it away, like off the island?

34:40.914 --> 34:43.414
Thor's hammer, in theory. No, that would...

34:43.416 --> 34:45.833
That would wipe half of
New York into the sea.

34:45.885 --> 34:48.302
Wait, if it breathes, can we kill it?

34:48.338 --> 34:51.589
The hot and cold are balanced,
but if we dump enough heat

34:51.641 --> 34:53.757
into the storm, it'll break apart.

34:53.810 --> 34:56.177
That would take an
enormous amount of hot air.

34:56.228 --> 34:58.145
I wouldn't even know how to
superheat something like that.

34:58.181 --> 35:00.264
- It would take a second sun.
- [Gasps]

35:00.316 --> 35:01.899
- I totally forgot we have one of those.
- You remember we have one of those.

35:01.935 --> 35:05.687
- We have a sun?
- Yes, in the Sun Room.

35:06.239 --> 35:07.738
What else would one store in a Sun Room?

35:07.774 --> 35:10.441
Uh, magazines, cozy chairs, mimosas?

35:10.493 --> 35:12.243
We need to figure out how to focus it.

35:12.278 --> 35:13.861
Cassandra, can you calculate what

35:13.896 --> 35:16.364
the thermal energy would
be? Jenkins, come with me.

35:16.416 --> 35:17.782
Jones, start reprogramming
the back door. Stone, come on!

35:17.834 --> 35:19.951
I've got a cunning plan.

35:19.953 --> 35:23.805
- [Wind howling]
- Frozen Land of Giants! [Spits]

35:24.541 --> 35:27.425
- [Birds cawing]
- Lost Jungle Kingdom.

35:27.460 --> 35:29.760
- [Bees buzzing]
- Hive of Giant Bees!

35:29.796 --> 35:31.295
Why do we even have that door?

35:31.297 --> 35:32.880
- [Skin sizzles]
- Aah! Sun Room!

35:32.932 --> 35:35.600
Found it. Okay, trapped Nemesis star by

35:35.635 --> 35:38.269
Einstein and Feynman in 1952
before it destroyed the Earth

35:38.304 --> 35:40.521
using technology from the Roswell project.

35:40.557 --> 35:42.356
I thought Roswell was aliens.

35:42.392 --> 35:44.609
It's never aliens. Give me your phone.

35:44.644 --> 35:46.561
Mr. Jenkins, would you please

35:46.613 --> 35:48.729
- program your back door technology controls...
- [Keys clacking]

35:48.781 --> 35:50.231
To that door right there?

35:50.283 --> 35:52.483
Ah, the focus. You do have a flair, sir.

35:52.535 --> 35:53.985
Mr. Jones, can you patch in

35:53.987 --> 35:56.320
Cassandra and Baird's conversations

35:56.322 --> 35:57.955
to the overall intercom system?

35:57.991 --> 35:59.407
- Stone.
- Yeah.

35:59.459 --> 36:00.658
Take a knee.

36:00.660 --> 36:02.209
I need you to get Judson's Mirror.

36:02.245 --> 36:03.828
Bring it back here with
the Glass of Narcissus.

36:03.880 --> 36:05.496
They have to be lined up
perfectly if we're gonna try

36:05.498 --> 36:07.582
and direct the energy
from that room, bounce it

36:07.634 --> 36:10.468
- all the way down the hallway into that room there. Got it?
- Yeah.

36:10.503 --> 36:11.886
So, that's the plan.

36:11.921 --> 36:13.471
We take the thermal burst
from a direct sunblast,

36:13.506 --> 36:15.389
bounce it off a couple mirrors into a door,

36:15.425 --> 36:17.475
focusing it up through
the storm, where it should

36:17.510 --> 36:19.343
burn off the cold air and break the cycle.

36:19.345 --> 36:21.395
Hopefully, if everything goes as planned,

36:21.481 --> 36:23.514
- storm falls apart.
- And if it all goes wrong?

36:23.566 --> 36:26.984
You and I get incinerated
and New York drowns.

36:27.020 --> 36:29.937
Sucky pep talk.

36:31.858 --> 36:33.240
[Muffled voice] Where you going?

36:33.276 --> 36:34.692
I need to monitor the changes on-site

36:34.744 --> 36:36.984
- to get the most reliable data.
- What's with the getup?

36:39.582 --> 36:41.449
It's all we got.

36:41.501 --> 36:45.086
Jenkins and I gotta open the door and, uh,

36:45.622 --> 36:49.207
let in the sunbeam, so...
it's gonna get a little hot.

36:49.759 --> 36:53.461
Hey, we were all right.

36:53.513 --> 36:57.014
We were fine through the three
months we were on our own, huh?

36:57.050 --> 36:59.884
I mean, this... this is not gonna kill me.

36:59.936 --> 37:03.888
No, but we weren't fine.
We weren't okay. I...

37:04.390 --> 37:06.724
I don't even know why we
went our separate ways.

37:06.776 --> 37:08.960
It just happens to people.

37:08.961 --> 37:12.464
No, it doesn't. Not to us.

37:13.032 --> 37:14.482
It's not happening.

37:23.409 --> 37:25.576
I'll see you on the other side, Cassie.

No, we didn't work together.
It was dumb and petty.

40:13.857 --> 40:16.524
You're right. We missed all
the clues the Library gave us,

40:16.576 --> 40:19.110
which we would've had if we
had been sharing information,

40:19.162 --> 40:20.779
