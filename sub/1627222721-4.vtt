00:01.001 --> 00:03.378
Mr. Benedict and Number Two are missing.

00:03.461 --> 00:05.922
-He kidnapped us.
-He wants me here.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.883
<i>He is inducing happiness.
It's dangerous.</i>

00:08.967 --> 00:09.926
-Sebastian?
-Sebastian?

00:10.010 --> 00:11.469
Blink if you hear us.

00:11.553 --> 00:13.179
If I could just have more time with him,

00:13.263 --> 00:16.599
<i>I really believe
I could get him to listen to me.</i>

00:16.683 --> 00:19.352
<i>We need to get out of here
and alert the authorities.</i>

00:20.186 --> 00:22.022
Why does it feel like we're descending?

00:22.105 --> 00:24.858
<i>We're experiencing
a very slight deflation issue.</i>

00:25.650 --> 00:27.902
<i>We're stowaways.
We need to find the next clue.</i>

00:27.986 --> 00:30.238
<i>It'll tell us where to go
when we get to Lisbon.</i>

00:30.321 --> 00:33.158
"Look up to the stars.
Take wing to the sun."

00:33.241 --> 00:35.368
It's a constellation. It's Apollo's bird.

00:35.452 --> 00:38.121
The train station in Lisbon
is Saint Apollo.

00:39.122 --> 00:41.541
<i>I should have known
they weren't real water polo players.</i>

00:41.624 --> 00:43.793
<i>They must be undercover.
Working for Curtain.</i>

00:45.003 --> 00:47.547
Four kids traveling alone
in a foreign country.

00:47.630 --> 00:49.716
They've proven to be
my only true adversaries.

00:49.799 --> 00:51.551
Treat them without mercy.

00:51.634 --> 00:53.303
Curtain's gray man.

00:53.386 --> 00:56.556
-Get in! Get in! Get in!
-Please go now!

01:15.366 --> 01:17.827
No, you speak bad Portuguese.

01:19.329 --> 01:22.082
He's right.
Your accent insults the nation.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.750
Listen to the girl.

01:24.334 --> 01:27.670
No sign of Curtain's gray man.
I don't get it.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.881
I thought he sent
the water polo team to follow us.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.509
Why would a man send a sports team
after you?

01:32.592 --> 01:33.593
It's Curtain.

01:33.676 --> 01:35.553
He probably has multiple teams
following us.

01:35.637 --> 01:39.224
Exactly. He kidnapped Mr. Benedict
and Number Two, and now he's after us.

01:40.183 --> 01:43.103
I bet Curtain's been plotting this
ever since we took down the Whisperer.

01:43.186 --> 01:46.815
-Revenge is a dish best served cold.
-Agree.

01:47.690 --> 01:49.943
-What if we let the grays capture us?
-What?

01:50.026 --> 01:51.861
Have you gone insane?

01:52.320 --> 01:54.239
Most likely they'll just take us back

01:54.322 --> 01:56.449
to wherever Mr. Benedict
and Number Two are being held.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.701
The same grays
that tried to brainsweep me?

01:58.785 --> 01:59.953
She makes a great point.

02:01.037 --> 02:03.081
Then we'll just have to be
more careful than ever.

02:03.790 --> 02:07.502
But if we stick together,
I really believe we can outsmart anyone.

02:07.585 --> 02:08.419
Debatable.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.548
You know, it's rude to listen in.

02:24.936 --> 02:26.521
-Come on, come on, come on.
-Hey.

02:27.355 --> 02:29.399
Hey, 932 escudos.

02:30.817 --> 02:31.943
Right.

02:32.026 --> 02:35.905
The ride was only 10 minutes.
It couldn't possibly be that much.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.199
My mother calibrated this meter.

02:38.783 --> 02:43.079
She's very old and weak,
but she insists on doing the work.

02:43.538 --> 02:46.833
The accuracy... is her greatest pride.

02:46.916 --> 02:50.587
"Down to the centimeter," she says.

02:50.670 --> 02:54.799
But maybe she's just a common crook, hmm?
A liar.

02:55.383 --> 02:58.303
-My mother.
-No, no.

02:58.928 --> 03:01.472
-I'm sure the meter is correct.
-Good.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.641
Nine hundred thirty-two escudos
and make it quick.

03:03.725 --> 03:06.895
The sandwich shop here
runs out of bifanas by four o'clock.

03:07.437 --> 03:11.191
All we have is... 98 escudos.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.067
Ninety-eight escudos.

03:13.151 --> 03:17.113
Police! Police! Police!

04:20.843 --> 04:23.137
Wait, wait, wait.
You don't need to talk to the cops.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.807
We can pay you in non-liquid assets.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.690
How would you like a drop forged C-clamp?

04:33.773 --> 04:36.276
This is an extremely expensive piece
of finely crafted--

04:36.359 --> 04:37.694
-I don't clamp.
-Okay.

04:37.777 --> 04:41.322
How about this
one-of-a-kind vintage protractor,

04:41.406 --> 04:42.824
-made in Holland?
-No.

04:42.907 --> 04:44.450
-Nail clippers?
-No.

04:44.534 --> 04:45.576
Leather hole punch?

04:47.537 --> 04:50.498
My German-engineered spyglass
with modified optics.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.086
Actually, I can't let that one go.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.963
I'll take the whole bucket.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.135
Uh, that's not possible.

05:02.218 --> 05:04.178
I can maybe bundle two or three things.

05:04.262 --> 05:07.223
-Bucket or police?
-But...

05:08.099 --> 05:08.933
-Wait, wait, wait.
-Police!

05:09.017 --> 05:10.518
-Sir, please.
-Enough!

05:18.359 --> 05:21.988
Here. This is worth a lot more
than cab fare.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.538
Deal. Now get out of here.

05:31.122 --> 05:33.916
Remember this face. You'll see it again.

05:39.839 --> 05:42.508
-I don't see any grays, do you?
-Hopefully, we lost them.

05:43.384 --> 05:44.677
Come on.

05:45.261 --> 05:48.598
Hey, thanks for giving up your necklace.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.809
-I was really...
-Don't cheapen it.

05:58.983 --> 06:01.110
PORTUGAL POST

06:01.194 --> 06:07.283
<i>Attention,
public notice. Miss Grizzi Laura...</i>

06:12.205 --> 06:14.540
Based on the size and the cut of the key,

06:14.624 --> 06:16.876
I'm guessing it's for a public locker
at the station.

06:16.959 --> 06:19.754
-Sherlock Holmes over here.
-Huh?

06:19.837 --> 06:23.883
We're sent to a train station. With a key.
Of course it's a locker.

06:24.509 --> 06:25.843
Kate could've figured that out.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.221
What? I'm just standing here,
minding my own business.

06:28.304 --> 06:29.972
I don't know. I'm hungry.

06:30.056 --> 06:33.726
Okay. Let's find the locker bay
and then we'll get some food.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.063
Constance, what's wrong?

06:37.980 --> 06:40.233
-We need to hurry.
-What are you talking about?

06:40.817 --> 06:43.694
-Are you seeing something?
-We need to find Mr. Benedict.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.197
Something is very wrong.

06:46.280 --> 06:51.536
Nathaniel. Nathaniel.
That was brilliant. Brilliant!

06:51.619 --> 06:55.331
-Oh, you enjoyed the broadcast.
-Very much. Very much.

06:55.415 --> 06:59.168
And it unlocks something.
I have never felt better.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.212
You are a visionary.

07:03.881 --> 07:05.007
My.

07:06.342 --> 07:09.011
I'd be lying if I said
I hadn't heard that before.

07:10.304 --> 07:12.890
You know, all the science medals,
magazine covers,

07:12.974 --> 07:15.101
honorary doctorates, genius grants, honor.

07:15.184 --> 07:16.436
Hmm. That's a lot of prestige.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.980
Cash tributes,
but they don't mean anything.

07:19.063 --> 07:20.690
-They're dust in the wind.
-Oh.

07:20.773 --> 07:21.983
Your word.

07:22.900 --> 07:23.860
That's really something.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.280
I'm so proud of you.

07:28.823 --> 07:31.451
And almost bizarrely happy.

07:32.034 --> 07:35.538
Yes. Yes. Happy.

07:35.621 --> 07:39.459
I knew that if you just gave it a chance,
you'd see the value in what I'm doing.

07:40.042 --> 07:42.378
-We're not meant to live in opposition.
-No. No, no, no.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.381
Together we can do
even more amazing things.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.674
Two parts greater than the whole.

07:46.757 --> 07:49.343
Ah, that volcano demonstration
we did at the orphanage,

07:49.427 --> 07:52.013
-do you remember that?
-Mercury thiocyanate.

07:52.096 --> 07:55.016
The intumescent reaction,
that was your vision.

07:55.099 --> 07:57.768
Oh, but it didn't work until you solved
the design for the central channel.

07:57.852 --> 08:01.022
Oh, that incredible plume
of smoke and ash!

08:01.105 --> 08:03.649
I did cough up black grit
for a week after.

08:03.733 --> 08:04.775
A prodigious amount.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.903
You know, as we used to say,
"no price too high..."

08:06.986 --> 08:08.237
"To pay for discovery."

08:13.034 --> 08:15.161
It is good to be back with you, Nathaniel.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.039
It is.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.252
-There's something nagging at me, though.
-Oh.

08:24.295 --> 08:27.465
Yeah, it's your associate. Number Two. Hm.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.550
She seems to have your ear

08:29.634 --> 08:31.802
and doesn't strike me
as particularly joyful.

08:33.012 --> 08:37.225
Do you think she could be...
convinced of our noble intentions?

08:39.018 --> 08:42.939
The way I feel now,
anything seems possible.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.359
Wonderful.

09:00.289 --> 09:04.126
POST, POLICE, HOSPITAL

09:07.672 --> 09:11.342
-Milligan. Our luggage is gone.
-You don't know that.

09:11.425 --> 09:14.595
I would just like to find Kate's
lucky windbreaker.

09:14.679 --> 09:17.723
Perhaps the time would be better
used finding transportation to Lisbon.

09:20.434 --> 09:21.644
I'm over parenting.

09:21.727 --> 09:25.022
Jackets can be bought.
Right now, we need a car.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.482
How far behind the kids are we?

09:26.566 --> 09:30.778
You don't want to know.
Which leads me to a more delicate point.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.949
-Ms. Perumal.
-Yes. I... What?

09:35.908 --> 09:37.743
-Where is she?
-I don't know.

09:37.827 --> 09:41.956
What I do know is
speed is our priority now.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.585
I have the utmost respect for educators,

09:45.668 --> 09:49.714
but maybe her skill set
is not what we need right now.

09:49.797 --> 09:52.633
I don't know. She gave me
some sage advice on the dirigible.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.468
About search and rescue?

09:56.846 --> 09:58.514
This is what we do.

09:59.181 --> 10:02.018
We know the craft.
We can move faster without her.

10:02.101 --> 10:03.352
And most importantly,

10:03.436 --> 10:06.606
we won't be putting her
in a dangerous situation

10:06.689 --> 10:08.524
where she's not prepared to...

10:16.115 --> 10:17.199
What do you think?

10:18.326 --> 10:20.202
I borrowed it from the farm back there.

10:21.704 --> 10:24.165
-You stole it.
-I left ample compensation.

10:24.248 --> 10:27.335
Double the Blue Book value of the vehicle,
plus a little extra for the hassle.

10:27.418 --> 10:29.462
And a thank you note. Carefully written.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.464
Beautifully, even, if I may.

10:31.547 --> 10:32.840
And I made this compass.

10:32.923 --> 10:35.051
Fairly simple
to magnetize a sewing needle.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.136
Drop it in the jam jar and voila.

10:37.219 --> 10:38.971
And I charted the fastest way to Lisbon.

10:39.055 --> 10:42.725
It's 90 miles due south,
which is that way.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.607
-I'm impressed.
-There's no key.

10:50.608 --> 10:54.111
-Did you hot wire this?
-There are things you don't know about me.

10:56.072 --> 10:56.947
Let's go.

11:04.830 --> 11:07.625
ANNOUNCER :
<i>Attention, public notice...</i>

11:15.257 --> 11:18.678
Four passes for unlimited
rail travel anywhere in Europe.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.596
So he wants us to go anywhere?

11:25.726 --> 11:28.771
"Well done, my friends.
You're on the right track.

11:28.854 --> 11:32.274
Now you must board the right train".
Signed, Mr. Benedict.

11:33.150 --> 11:38.155
"Much like a racecar or a train,
one did reverse, but stayed the same.

11:38.239 --> 11:42.827
Constance has the gift,
so no need to borrow or rob.

11:42.910 --> 11:44.704
Just the eye will do the job.

11:46.539 --> 11:50.626
Look into it.
It requires further investigation.

11:50.710 --> 11:54.630
Through friendship,
your society sees its next destination."

11:54.714 --> 11:56.549
Rhyming is a Band Aid for hacks.

11:56.632 --> 12:00.845
-Like Poe? Frost? Dickinson?
-Hacks.

12:02.012 --> 12:03.681
It says Constance has the gift.

12:03.764 --> 12:04.932
I have many gifts.

12:05.015 --> 12:09.186
Maybe Mr. Benedict is talking about
Constance's gift of psychic ability.

12:09.270 --> 12:13.149
Right. "Just the eye" could be referring
to Constance using her third eye.

12:13.232 --> 12:16.068
That's what the fortune tellers
at the circus called their psychic powers.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.362
I don't know.
Do we really think Mr. Benedict

12:18.446 --> 12:22.450
would have us rely on something
as unscientific as some intuitive power?

12:22.533 --> 12:25.703
Well, Mr. Benedict has been living
with Constance for a while now,

12:25.786 --> 12:28.998
-so maybe he knows just how mu--
-I know what the gift is.

12:36.630 --> 12:40.843
-Now make a wish.
-I wish to be free of pointless commands.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.136
Oh. Here.

12:47.391 --> 12:49.727
-Nice.
-Everyone wants a piece?

12:49.810 --> 12:52.605
Yes. Yes. Please, please,
please. please, please.

12:52.688 --> 12:54.440
Chocolate. Ooh. Oh.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.067
Why don't you use this instead?

12:59.528 --> 13:02.031
We're gonna be in Europe
for your birthday, so.

13:03.282 --> 13:04.700
Oh.

13:06.035 --> 13:10.122
It will be tough to outdo this,
but I enjoy a challenge.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.166
-Shall we?
-Of course.

13:17.671 --> 13:22.134
Now, Constance, I, um... I was wondering,
on the day of your birth,

13:22.218 --> 13:25.513
if you were ever curious
to learn about that very day?

13:26.472 --> 13:29.517
About where you came from,
about the people and places

13:29.600 --> 13:32.144
-from when you were too young to remember?
-I'm fine.

13:33.687 --> 13:35.731
-Fine?
-Yes.

13:35.815 --> 13:42.071
I have a bed, books, food, people,
an adequate chess partner.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.239
Hm.

13:43.823 --> 13:47.034
This is my home. I'm fine.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.247
A well-reasoned point.

13:51.997 --> 13:55.292
But if you're ever curious,
I can help, yes?

13:55.376 --> 13:56.752
Oh, I almost forgot.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.630
I have a birthday present for you.

14:02.424 --> 14:03.509
Here you are.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.652
This is slightly ugly.

14:21.735 --> 14:26.574
Oh, well, maybe it'll grow on you.

14:31.453 --> 14:33.789
Why didn't you tell us the locket
was from Mr. Benedict?

14:33.873 --> 14:35.457
Constance, you shouldn't have given it up.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.710
We could have come up
with another way out of that situation.

14:37.793 --> 14:40.713
You sacrificed it. For my bucket.

14:40.796 --> 14:42.798
Kate will fall apart without her bucket.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.842
I don't want
to pick up the pieces.

14:46.302 --> 14:47.803
You and Sticky look out for grays.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.889
Reynie, I'm gonna need your help.
Follow me.

14:50.806 --> 14:52.683
We're getting your locket back.

14:56.186 --> 14:58.731
Dr. Curtain needs me,
so this had better be important.

14:58.814 --> 15:00.107
I'm already stretched too thin.

15:00.190 --> 15:01.692
We wouldn't bother you
unless it was urgent.

15:01.775 --> 15:03.819
-Alarming.
-Sebastian, what are you doing in here?

15:06.155 --> 15:09.533
-Why have you imprisoned Sebastian and...
-Paula.

15:09.617 --> 15:12.411
-Paula?
-Look closer?

15:13.996 --> 15:16.123
-They won't speak.
-They don't even blink.

15:16.206 --> 15:18.000
We found him like this
in the woods yesterday.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.710
And Paula this morning in the orchard.

15:19.793 --> 15:22.171
We didn't want to alarm anyone,
so we put them in here.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.092
I don't see the problem.

15:28.427 --> 15:29.595
Uh...

15:29.678 --> 15:32.139
This is obviously some sort of deep
meditative work they're doing.

15:34.224 --> 15:36.101
-Or...
-Are you implying that Dr. Curtain's

15:36.185 --> 15:38.395
revolutionary system
has something to do with this?

15:39.063 --> 15:41.815
Well, they were some of Dr. Curtain's
earliest adopters.

15:41.899 --> 15:44.234
-Quite steeped in the methods.
-Then, by all means...

15:45.194 --> 15:46.236
you go tell him.

15:46.987 --> 15:49.448
-Not really within our purview.
-Is he currently in a good mood?

15:49.531 --> 15:51.784
Exactly. No one is going to tell him.

15:51.867 --> 15:54.078
Dr. Curtain is on a mission and I...

15:54.828 --> 15:57.414
we are the custodians of that mission.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.416
We are not going to interrupt
his important work

15:59.500 --> 16:02.586
and occupy his valuable brain space
for what is obviously some...

16:03.712 --> 16:04.797
unrelated ailment.

16:08.258 --> 16:10.344
Just find them a doctor.

16:10.427 --> 16:12.137
I'm sure this could be straightened out.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.014
-We're on it.
-Only the best.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.140
Good.

16:22.523 --> 16:25.609
Every time. Unwanted tomato.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.863
-Just grab it and go.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.741
You trade him.
You said you'd do it. You promised me.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.576
No. He's not gonna... It doesn't matter.

16:34.660 --> 16:35.953
-You promised me.
-He's not gonna know.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.997
-Come on.
-It's not fair.

16:42.084 --> 16:45.921
Hi, sir. I just rode in your cab
from the docks?

16:46.005 --> 16:48.007
I remember. It was recent.

16:48.090 --> 16:51.969
Um, I just wanted to thank you again
for the elegant cab ride.

16:52.553 --> 16:55.389
-"Elegant?"
-I appreciate efficiency.

16:55.889 --> 16:56.974
Bit of an engineer.

16:57.933 --> 16:59.643
Don't you have a train to catch?

17:01.353 --> 17:03.480
No. Kate, you're doing this.

17:05.607 --> 17:09.570
Sir, I'm trying to be a better person.

17:09.653 --> 17:13.240
-Who cares?
-I'm not proud of my recent behavior.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.367
I have to make it right.

17:16.243 --> 17:17.911
-Say it.
-Give me a second.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.416
-The locket.
-A deal's a deal.

17:22.499 --> 17:27.046
Exactly, but when one party misrepresents
something to the other party,

17:27.129 --> 17:28.922
it's not right.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.675
-What are you talking about?
-The locket isn't worth anything.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.761
It's a fake.
All it has is sentimental value.

17:33.844 --> 17:37.598
And if I'm being honest,
which I am trying very hard to be

17:37.681 --> 17:40.392
in my life right now, not much of that.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.979
-We scammed you.
-No, it's a trick.

17:45.439 --> 17:47.399
-Great.
-Where are you going?

17:47.483 --> 17:50.319
My conscience is clear. Thank you.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.656
-Nothing I can say at this point.
-Stop.

17:55.949 --> 17:59.703
Give me the bucket then
or we're back to calling the cops.

17:59.787 --> 18:00.788
Can't do that.

18:00.871 --> 18:05.250
The transaction is legally done,
but I'll trade you for something better.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.377
This is just about making it right.

18:10.839 --> 18:12.925
Wait, wait. What's the first one?

18:15.135 --> 18:18.847
-This?
-The one you put back.

18:24.061 --> 18:27.106
I thought you were trying to learn
a lesson in honesty.

18:41.912 --> 18:42.871
Victory.

18:48.710 --> 18:51.755
-Good con, partner.
-Let's figure out how to use it, quick.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.924
Our train could be leaving any minute.

18:57.761 --> 19:03.600
You claim that
Dr. L.D. Curtain, the L.D. Curtain,

19:03.684 --> 19:06.311
kidnapped you
and held you against your will?

19:06.395 --> 19:09.273
Indeed he did.
Off the street and in his compound.

19:09.356 --> 19:13.735
And he's still holding his twin brother,
Mr. Nicholas Benedict, against his will.

19:13.819 --> 19:16.446
Do you have the means to lead us
to his location?

19:16.530 --> 19:17.990
Yes. I know I can.

19:18.073 --> 19:19.575
-Good.
-Good.

19:19.658 --> 19:22.077
Because there are many
in the gendarmerie here

19:22.161 --> 19:25.497
-who would like to firmly shake his hand.
-What?

19:25.581 --> 19:30.002
You seem genuine and sincere
in a way I rarely encounter,

19:30.085 --> 19:33.380
-but your claim is nonsensical.
-You malign a good man.

19:33.463 --> 19:35.048
One of the best men.

19:35.132 --> 19:38.552
A man literally committed
to the happiness of others.

19:39.219 --> 19:42.806
You don't know who he really is
or what he is capable of.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.600
He lifted us from the ashes!

19:44.683 --> 19:46.768
He created the ashes!

19:48.395 --> 19:49.605
He created them.

19:49.688 --> 19:54.193
Someone's finally at the wheel
and all you can do is naysay.

19:54.276 --> 19:58.113
You sound like a person who, frankly,

19:58.197 --> 20:02.159
would benefit from time
in Dr. Curtain's program.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.661
Compulsory or not.

20:06.246 --> 20:07.706
POLICE

20:13.462 --> 20:15.339
You know what? You're probably right.

20:19.009 --> 20:22.221
-Until we meet again.
-Of course.

20:31.855 --> 20:34.107
Come on, Rhonda.
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

20:46.328 --> 20:48.497
What's the problem? Why did we stop?

20:52.125 --> 20:53.627
We're out of gas.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.008
There's a village up ahead.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.219
Way up ahead.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.432
I'll be right back.

21:45.387 --> 21:46.388
A boot?

21:47.597 --> 21:49.057
So you stole the gas.

21:49.141 --> 21:54.187
I left ample compensation,
and a workman-like thank you note.

22:02.612 --> 22:04.239
Does anyone have any gum?

22:06.908 --> 22:08.118
"Look into it.

22:08.201 --> 22:10.120
It requires your investigation.

22:10.203 --> 22:14.458
Through friendship,
your society sees its next destination."

22:14.541 --> 22:16.626
-Hmm.
-What "hmm?"

22:16.710 --> 22:18.587
I just don't see anything.

22:18.670 --> 22:22.215
So don't look at it. Look into it.
Like it said.

22:34.853 --> 22:35.979
A lens.

22:42.486 --> 22:44.029
There's a world in here.

22:52.245 --> 22:53.246
Germany?

22:53.330 --> 22:54.664
It's Germany.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.792
Yes, train to Germany. Let's go.

22:56.875 --> 22:58.168
Hamburg's in Germany.

22:58.251 --> 23:03.006
Frankfurt, Berlin,
Baden-Baden, Munich, Mannheim.

23:03.090 --> 23:04.341
We need more information.

23:04.424 --> 23:07.594
And we need it fast.
Curtain's men can show up any second.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.699
I'd like a receipt, please.

23:37.874 --> 23:39.167
What's happening?

23:50.804 --> 23:54.099
Oh, oh, hello and where have you been?

23:56.184 --> 23:57.936
You're enjoying some time alone?

23:58.019 --> 24:01.314
I'll start with the good news.
I found a way out of here.

24:01.398 --> 24:04.609
-Oh.
-Loading dock. Pie truck. Village.

24:04.693 --> 24:06.987
Twenty kilometers away,
give or take from my internal clock.

24:07.070 --> 24:09.322
My brother has pie trucks?
You stole a pie truck?

24:09.406 --> 24:10.991
Used a pie truck.

24:11.074 --> 24:12.242
Oh, well. What's the bad news?

24:12.325 --> 24:14.411
I'm just, I'm sure
it's just a matter of perspective?

24:15.078 --> 24:18.498
When I went to the local police,
no one believed me.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.584
-They're all cult of Curtain.
-Oh.

24:21.918 --> 24:24.504
I tried calling the mansion,
but no one picked up.

24:24.588 --> 24:26.548
They're probably on their way
to find us, but how?

24:26.631 --> 24:28.842
-Called my family in Luxembourg.

24:28.925 --> 24:30.844
Of course, they didn't pick up.

24:30.927 --> 24:35.223
Then I tried calling Interpol
and they were actually rude to me.

24:35.932 --> 24:38.101
The fact is we are on our own,

24:38.185 --> 24:41.104
which means it's up to us
to take down Curtain ourselves.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.272
Yes.

24:43.648 --> 24:44.816
What's there to smile about?

24:48.653 --> 24:50.530
Well, what isn't there to smile about?

24:51.781 --> 24:56.036
I'm just reflecting on how maybe all
this is possibly a choice.

24:56.119 --> 24:57.537
And, of course, our current status.

24:57.621 --> 24:58.663
Kidnapped. Status, kidnapped?

24:58.747 --> 25:01.666
No, our, our willingness to learn from it.

25:02.375 --> 25:04.961
To expand ourselves.

25:05.545 --> 25:07.380
-Oh, no.
-What?

25:07.464 --> 25:09.508
-Curtain did his thing to you.

25:09.591 --> 25:12.385
If by "thing", you mean
my brother's breakthrough,

25:12.469 --> 25:15.013
neurobehavioral achievement, then yes.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.140
No.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.976
I know what you must be thinking,
I know what you're thinking.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.311
I know what you're thinking.

25:21.811 --> 25:24.397
But I can assure you that this...

25:25.482 --> 25:27.692
incredible, newfound joy

25:27.776 --> 25:31.655
is not going to influence my ability
to do what is right.

25:33.281 --> 25:36.618
Right here is where we need to stay.
To learn more.

25:37.285 --> 25:41.873
To understand this. This!

25:43.500 --> 25:44.584
Here.

25:49.256 --> 25:50.465
I don't know what to tell you.

25:51.466 --> 25:53.593
There's no signs of physical distress,

25:53.677 --> 25:57.472
not chemically induced,
not catatonia per se.

25:57.556 --> 26:01.268
Pupils respond normally, no brain injury,

26:01.351 --> 26:03.812
hemorrhage, or internal trauma.

26:04.521 --> 26:06.231
It's like nothing I've ever seen.

26:06.565 --> 26:09.484
Surely there must be
some medication to give them.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.445
Perhaps a form of electrotherapy?

26:12.529 --> 26:13.947
A nice jolt.

26:14.030 --> 26:16.491
Sir, I'm a doctor. No.

26:17.534 --> 26:22.956
There's no conventional reason
for this, this... vacancy.

26:29.212 --> 26:30.297
Another one?

26:32.382 --> 26:33.842
-Another one.
-Another one.

26:35.385 --> 26:37.304
"Much like a racecar or a train,

26:37.387 --> 26:39.431
one did reverse but stayed the same."

26:40.307 --> 26:43.602
-Mr. Benedict is so obsessed with words.
-He is.

26:43.685 --> 26:45.645
So, what about the words themselves?

26:46.354 --> 26:48.356
Not what they represent,
but what they are.

26:52.402 --> 26:55.614
-Kate, do you have a pen?
-Do I have a pen?

26:58.700 --> 27:00.368
Each clue has a few words

27:00.452 --> 27:03.163
that are the same forwards
as they are backwards.

27:03.246 --> 27:08.043
"Racecar," "did," "borrow or rob," "eye."

27:08.501 --> 27:10.128
"Reverse, but stayed the same."

27:10.211 --> 27:13.006
-They're palindromes.
-Palindrome, Germany. All aboard.

27:16.593 --> 27:20.805
Our destination must be a city in Germany
whose name is a palindrome.

27:21.389 --> 27:24.267
And I know for a fact
there are only seven places in Germany

27:24.351 --> 27:25.560
with a palindrome for its name.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.646
Four are too small
to have a train station.

27:27.729 --> 27:28.772
I'm not even gonna ask.

27:29.314 --> 27:30.148
Common knowledge.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.864
There it is. Burggrub.

27:39.741 --> 27:41.242
It leaves in five minutes.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.286
-We should--
-Go right now! Go right now!

27:45.246 --> 27:46.831
Plan shake and bake. Execute!

27:46.915 --> 27:48.458
-Plan what?
-Scatter!

28:28.915 --> 28:30.125
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

28:30.208 --> 28:33.086
<i>the BergenLiner SchnellerZug
is now departing.</i>

28:33.169 --> 28:35.171
<i>-All points to Burggrub.</i>
-We did it.

28:35.755 --> 28:37.006
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

28:37.090 --> 28:40.093
<i>the BergenLiner SchnellerZug
is now departing.</i>

28:40.176 --> 28:41.803
Reinforcements.

28:43.430 --> 28:45.181
Should have planted more fruit.

28:49.310 --> 28:52.522
They walked right past Curtain's gray
like they didn't even know each other.

28:52.605 --> 28:54.190
They aren't working together?

28:54.274 --> 28:56.860
-They're a third party.
-Soldiers of fortune.

28:56.943 --> 28:58.695
Working for who?

29:04.367 --> 29:07.120
What now?
The water polo team is on board.

29:07.203 --> 29:09.164
We can start by not calling them
a water polo team.

29:09.247 --> 29:11.207
Disgrace to the sport.

29:11.291 --> 29:13.543
They broke into our room
and tried to kidnap us.

29:13.626 --> 29:15.879
Probably like they kidnapped
Mr. Benedict and Number Two.

29:15.962 --> 29:18.506
And now we're on a moving train
with nowhere to run.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.843
-This is a classic killing box.
-I wouldn't say nowhere.

29:21.926 --> 29:24.137
Pop out a couple of hex screws,
we can jump out here.

29:24.220 --> 29:26.347
A couple of broken ribs,
maybe a dislocated shoulder,

29:26.431 --> 29:29.476
-but we'd live.
-No one's jumping off a moving train.

29:30.351 --> 29:31.478
What are they waiting for?

29:31.561 --> 29:33.772
Probably the cover of night
when everyone's asleep.

29:33.855 --> 29:35.148
I say we attack.

29:35.732 --> 29:38.151
-What is wrong with you?
-They will not expect it.

29:38.985 --> 29:40.945
Guys, we can handle this, no problem.

29:41.029 --> 29:43.656
Tonight,
we each take shifts staying awake.

29:44.199 --> 29:47.952
If they make their move,
the whole train hears about it.

30:13.394 --> 30:14.437
What time is it?

30:18.441 --> 30:19.859
It's 4:37.

30:20.902 --> 30:21.903
Your turn.

30:23.488 --> 30:27.367
-Okay. Okay. Right.
-You haven't slept. Why not?

30:28.535 --> 30:30.787
It's not exactly a relaxing time.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.622
I'm invigorated.

30:33.873 --> 30:37.544
Bottom line... can you do this?

30:40.046 --> 30:42.674
-Yes.
-Can you?

30:43.508 --> 30:46.135
-Yes.
-You haven't prepared yourself.

30:50.807 --> 30:52.392
Now I sleep.

31:54.537 --> 31:57.749
Constance? Constance?

31:57.832 --> 31:58.917
Constance!

32:00.293 --> 32:02.086
-What's going on?

32:02.170 --> 32:03.713
Constance is gone.
