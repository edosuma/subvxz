00:02.836 --> 00:04.754
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>

00:04.838 --> 00:06.089
IS RECORDED IN FRONT
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:06.172 --> 00:07.924
- GUESS WHAT MADONNA,
JAMIE LEE CURTIS, AND I

00:08.007 --> 00:09.259
HAVE IN COMMON.

00:09.342 --> 00:12.387
- SLEPT WITH WARREN BEATTY?

00:12.470 --> 00:14.639
- NO.
- PEAKED IN THE '80s?

00:14.723 --> 00:16.599
- NO, STOP GUESSING.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.435
WE'RE ALL CELEBRITIES

00:18.518 --> 00:20.270
WHO ARE ALSO
CHILDREN'S BOOK WRITERS.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.355
- YOU'VE WRITTEN
A CHILDREN'S BOOK?

00:22.439 --> 00:25.275
- "HAVE WRITTEN," "WILL WRITE,"
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

00:25.358 --> 00:28.111
THE IMPORTANT THING IS,
WE'RE DOING THIS TOGETHER.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.238
- YOU WANT ME TO WORK
ON YOUR BOOK WITH YOU?

00:30.321 --> 00:31.614
- WORK WITH ME,
WORK INSTEAD OF ME,

00:31.698 --> 00:33.992
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

00:34.075 --> 00:36.035
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M IN.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.996
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO WRITE
A CHILDREN'S BOOK.

00:38.079 --> 00:39.622
OH, I USED TO LOVE
MAKING UP STORIES FOR MY KIDS.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.458
- OH, ME TOO.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.293
MY FAVORITE WAS,
"MOMMY LOVED YOU

00:43.376 --> 00:44.586
"IN THE SCHOOL PLAY,

00:44.669 --> 00:46.337
"BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE ME

00:46.421 --> 00:49.299
BECAUSE I WAS
IN THE VERY LAST ROW."

00:49.382 --> 00:51.468
OH, I TOLD THAT ONE AGAIN
AND AGAIN.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.553
- OH, MY GOD.

00:53.636 --> 00:55.805
I JUST FOUND OUT MY SISTER'S
COMING TO CLEVELAND.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.640
- YOU HAVE A SISTER?

00:57.724 --> 00:59.142
- SHE'S BEEN A NUN
FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS.

00:59.225 --> 01:01.311
SHE'S NOTHING LIKE ME.

01:01.394 --> 01:03.980
- WELL, YOU BOTH SPEND
A LOT OF TIME ON YOUR KNEES.

01:07.192 --> 01:09.652
- ACTUALLY, SHE'S DECIDED
TO LEAVE THE CONVENT.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.821
- WOW, THAT'S GONNA BE
A BIG ADJUSTMENT FOR HER

01:11.905 --> 01:13.323
OUT IN THE REAL WORLD.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.033
- POOR, POOR JILL.

01:15.116 --> 01:16.326
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN A BIT
OF A MESS.

01:16.409 --> 01:18.495
CLUMSY AND MOUSY,

01:18.578 --> 01:20.163
LOOKING TO HER BEAUTIFUL,
GLAMOROUS SISTER

01:20.246 --> 01:21.956
FOR PROTECTION.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.666
- OH, THE BEAUTIFUL
AND GLAMOROUS

01:23.750 --> 01:26.169
DO BEAR A LOT
OF RESPONSIBILITY.

01:26.252 --> 01:28.671
- YOU KNOW, RESPONSIBILITY
WAS ACTUALLY THE THEME

01:28.755 --> 01:30.340
OF MY RADIO SHOW
YESTERDAY.

01:30.423 --> 01:31.633
DID ANYBODY HEAR IT?
- I DID.

01:31.716 --> 01:33.468
BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE ME

01:33.551 --> 01:34.844
BECAUSE I WAS
IN THE VERY LAST ROW.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.726
- AS YOUR ASSISTANT,
I'M RUNNING OUT OF EXCUSES

01:41.810 --> 01:43.937
FOR WHY YOU'RE NOT
AT CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS.

01:44.020 --> 01:46.189
- WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM TODAY?

01:46.272 --> 01:48.191
- THAT YOU WERE
ON A FACT-FINDING MISSION

01:48.274 --> 01:50.026
TO FIND THE BEST BEER
IN CLEVELAND.

01:50.109 --> 01:51.653
- WELL, YOU WEREN'T LYING.

01:55.156 --> 01:58.368
- WELL, EVERYONE'S EXCITED
ABOUT THE PARTY YOU'RE HOSTING

01:58.451 --> 02:00.662
FOR OUR SISTER CITY
IN ENGLAND,

02:00.745 --> 02:02.539
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT'S FASCINATING?

02:02.622 --> 02:05.333
OUR SISTER CITY
IS ALSO CALLED CLEVELAND.

02:05.416 --> 02:07.377
- I DO KNOW
WHAT'S FASCINATING,

02:07.460 --> 02:10.880
AND THAT ISN'T IT.

02:10.964 --> 02:14.217
- NOW, THE GUEST OF HONOR
IS THE EARL OF CLEVELAND.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.302
WE NEED TO GO OVER PROTOCOL,

02:16.386 --> 02:19.764
SO YOU DON'T CREATE
ANOTHER INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT,

02:19.848 --> 02:22.475
LIKE YOU DID WITH
THAT GERMAN MAYOR LAST MONTH.

02:22.559 --> 02:25.520
- WHAT INCIDENT?
I WAS MAKING A JOKE.

02:25.603 --> 02:27.230
- YOU PUT A COMB
UNDER YOUR NOSE

02:27.313 --> 02:29.232
AND GOOSE-STEPPED
BEHIND HIM.

02:32.318 --> 02:35.780
- I MAY HAVE BEEN TESTING BEER
THAT DAY TOO.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.285
- ELKA, MAMIE SUE,

02:40.368 --> 02:44.539
THIS IS MY SISTER JILL.

02:44.622 --> 02:45.832
MAY WE?
- OF COURSE.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.423
- THIS IS FROM THAT GENTLEMAN
AT THE BAR.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.383
- WOW.

02:55.466 --> 02:57.260
MEN HAVE ALWAYS FOUND YOU
IRRESISTIBLE.

02:57.343 --> 03:01.055
- PROBABLY 'CAUSE
SHE DOESN'T RESIST.

03:01.139 --> 03:02.891
- ACTUALLY, GROWING UP,

03:02.974 --> 03:04.601
EVEN IF SHE WAS WITH A BOY
SHE LIKED,

03:04.684 --> 03:06.269
SHE'D ALWAYS LOOK OUT
FOR ME.

03:06.352 --> 03:08.062
BUT ANY TIME
I TOOK A TUMBLE,

03:08.146 --> 03:10.064
SHE'D BE RIGHT THERE
TO PICK ME UP,

03:10.148 --> 03:12.233
DUST ME OFF, AND SAY,
"ON YOUR FEET, CABBAGE,"

03:12.317 --> 03:13.735
AND THEN SHE'D PUNCH
WHOEVER LAUGHED AT ME

03:13.818 --> 03:16.112
IN THE THROAT.

03:16.195 --> 03:19.115
- MAY I ASK WHY YOU QUIT
BEING A NUN?

03:19.198 --> 03:21.200
IS IT BECAUSE
YOU'RE A FLIBBERTIGIBBET,

03:21.284 --> 03:26.122
A WILL-O'-THE-WISP,
A CLOWN?

03:26.205 --> 03:28.333
- I DIDN'T FEEL
I HAD THE CALLING ANYMORE,

03:28.416 --> 03:30.251
SO I LEFT.

03:30.335 --> 03:33.212
- I BET THAT RAISED
A LOT OF EYEBROW.

03:35.882 --> 03:38.718
WHAT?
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO SEES IT?

03:41.220 --> 03:43.848
- ELKA, THAT IS EXACTLY
THE KIND OF JOKE

03:43.932 --> 03:47.101
YOU CAN'T MAKE AT THE PARTY
FOR THE EARL OF CLEVELAND.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.646
- THE EARL OF CLEVELAND
IS COMING HERE?

03:49.729 --> 03:52.982
PERCY LENNOX-GORDON.
- 47TH IN LINE TO THE THRONE.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.317
- WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME
TO THE PARTY

03:54.400 --> 03:55.818
WE'RE THROWING FOR HIM?

03:55.902 --> 03:57.737
- YES!
AND WHO KNOWS?

03:57.820 --> 03:59.656
MAYBE HE SEES ME.
I SEE HIM.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.491
ONE THING
LEADS TO ANOTHER,

04:01.574 --> 04:02.825
AND 46 UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENTS
LATER,

04:02.909 --> 04:06.162
I'M QUEEN OF ENGLAND.

04:06.245 --> 04:07.914
- I DON'T THINK
I WANT TO COME.

04:07.997 --> 04:08.998
I'M NOT VERY GOOD
AT PARTIES.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.626
- OH, POOR JILL.

04:11.709 --> 04:13.169
I'LL MAKE SURE
YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME.

04:13.252 --> 04:15.171
YOU CAN BORROW MY CLOTHES,

04:15.254 --> 04:18.341
AND MAYBE WE CAN TAKE CARE
OF SOME OF THIS TOO.

04:18.423 --> 04:20.343
- ELKA AND I ARE GOING
TO THE BEAUTY SALON.

04:20.426 --> 04:21.678
YOU CAN COME WITH US.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.179
- THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

04:23.262 --> 04:26.432
- I ALMOST BECAME A NUN,

04:26.516 --> 04:28.518
BUT THEN I LEARNED
THAT THOSE BIG HATS

04:28.601 --> 04:30.812
DON'T REALLY MAKE YOU FLY,
EVEN ON A REALLY WINDY DAY.

04:33.606 --> 04:35.650
AND I LIKED SEX
WITH MEN.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.031
- OKAY, EVEN THOUGH
IT'S A CHILDREN'S BOOK,

04:42.115 --> 04:43.700
THERE IS A LOT TO DO.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.410
ONCE WE COME UP
WITH OUR IDEA,

04:45.493 --> 04:47.120
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO
AN OUTLINE,

04:47.203 --> 04:48.997
FIRST DRAFT,
SECOND DRAFT,

04:49.080 --> 04:51.040
AND THEN WE SHOULD BE DONE
IN SIX MONTHS.

04:51.124 --> 04:54.002
- THAT'S GREAT.
IT'S DUE MONDAY.

04:54.085 --> 04:55.712
- WHAT?

04:55.795 --> 04:57.046
- AND THE EDITOR'S
COMING BY TODAY

04:57.130 --> 04:58.715
TO SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.758
- WHAT?
- DON'T ACT SURPRISED.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.552
WE'VE HAD A WHOLE YEAR
TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.345
- WHAT?

05:04.429 --> 05:05.888
YOU HAVE HAD A WHOLE YEAR?

05:05.972 --> 05:08.599
- NO, WE HAVE HAD A WHOLE YEAR.

05:08.683 --> 05:11.102
I TOLD HIM THAT I'VE HAD
A COLLABORATOR ALL THIS TIME,

05:11.185 --> 05:13.062
YOU KNOW,
TO PUT HIM AT EASE.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.232
HE THINKS THAT ACTORS ARE LAZY
AND UNRELIABLE.

05:16.315 --> 05:19.068
WHEN WILL
THAT STEREOTYPE END?

05:19.152 --> 05:20.862
- IS JILL BACK
FROM HER MAKEOVER?

05:20.945 --> 05:23.364
- NO, NOT YET.
- POOR THING.

05:23.448 --> 05:24.657
HOPE SHE'S NOT EXPECTING
A MIRACLE.

05:31.372 --> 05:33.249
- HOW DO I LOOK?
- WHOA.

05:33.332 --> 05:35.084
- OH, MY GOODNESS.
JILL!

05:35.168 --> 05:37.587
- JOY, DEAR,
YOU'LL WANT TO SEE THIS.

05:40.548 --> 05:41.424

{\an8}TO BRITISH NOBILITY.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.330

FROWNING WAS FROWNED UPON.

- THAT COULDN'T BE FURTHER
FROM THE TRUTH!

10:01.600 --> 10:03.436
- OKAY, LOOK, THE EDITOR'S
GONNA BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.187
WE STILL DON'T HAVE AN IDEA
FOR THIS BOOK.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.148
- DON'T PANIC.
MAYBE HE'LL BE LATE.

10:07.231 --> 10:08.983
[doorbell chimes]
OH, MY GOD, HE'S NOT LATE.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.693
AND THE ADVANCE HE GAVE US
WAS HUGE,

10:10.776 --> 10:12.361
AND WE'VE ALREADY
SPENT IT.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.196
- WHAT?
I DIDN'T GET ANY MONEY.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.364
- YOU'VE ONLY BEEN WORKING HERE
A DAY.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.033
DON'T GET GREEDY.

10:17.116 --> 10:20.494
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL STALL HIM.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.538
ANDERSON, HOW LOVELY
TO SEE YOU.

10:22.621 --> 10:24.248
THIS IS MY COLLABORATOR,
MELANIE.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.000
- HELLO.
- LISTEN.

10:26.083 --> 10:27.877
WE COULD DO
THAT WHOLE DANCE,

10:27.960 --> 10:30.046
BUT LET ME JUST BOTTOM-LINE THIS
FOR YOU.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.881
MELANIE AND I JUST NEED
A LITTLE--

10:31.964 --> 10:33.257
- VICTORIA,
YOU BETTER NOT BE ASKING

10:33.341 --> 10:35.092
FOR ANOTHER EXTENSION.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.927
YOU AND MELANIE
HAVE HAD TWO YEARS.

10:37.011 --> 10:39.597
- TWO?

10:39.680 --> 10:42.683
- EXTENSION, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.727
DELAY THIS IDEA
THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE

10:44.810 --> 10:47.563
CHILDREN'S LITERATURE
FOREVER?

10:47.646 --> 10:49.899
IF ANYTHING,
WE NEED LESS TIME.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.734
[phone ringing]
- FANTASTIC.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.569
I WANT TO HEAR IT
AFTER I TAKE THIS.

10:53.652 --> 10:54.695
IS THERE A PLACE I CAN--
- OH, YES.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.572
RIGHT DOWN HERE.

10:56.655 --> 10:58.407
JUST TAKE YOUR TIME,
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,

10:58.491 --> 11:00.242
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO TIGHTEN YOUR SOCKS,

11:00.326 --> 11:01.202
BECAUSE THEY'RE ABOUT TO GET
KNOCKED OFF.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.414
- WHY DID YOU TELL HIM
THAT WE HAVE A GREAT IDEA?

11:05.498 --> 11:07.249
HONEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK,

11:07.333 --> 11:08.918
ONE'S JUST GONNA WALK
IN THE FRONT DOOR?

11:09.001 --> 11:10.628
- AND NOW,
THANKS TO YOU,

11:10.711 --> 11:13.714
I HAVE TO WEAR
THIS STUPID EYE PATCH.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.758
- IT'S NOT MY FAULT.
FACE IT.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.843
YOU LIKED ME
WHEN I WAS MOUSY,

11:17.927 --> 11:19.553
AND NOW THAT THAT'S CHANGED,
YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.555
- NONSENSE!

11:21.639 --> 11:23.724
ALL I'VE EVER BEEN
IS A PROTECTIVE BIG SISTER.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.768
- THEN HOW COME WHEN YOU HAD
AN EYEBROW-WAXING BUSINESS,

11:25.851 --> 11:27.645
YOU NEVER GOT RID
OF MY UNIBROW?

11:27.728 --> 11:29.438
- WHY WOULD YOU WANT ME TO?

11:29.522 --> 11:30.981
SO YOU COULD BE SEXY
FOR GOD?

11:31.065 --> 11:32.566
THAT'S SICK.

11:36.028 --> 11:38.656
- SO TELL ME THE IDEA.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.741
- IT'S A STORY
ABOUT TWO SISTERS,

11:40.825 --> 11:42.952
JOY AND JILL.

11:43.035 --> 11:46.122
ONE WAS MOUSY
HER WHOLE LIFE

11:46.205 --> 11:48.290
BECAUSE SHE WAS A MOUSE.

11:48.374 --> 11:49.625
- AH!

11:49.708 --> 11:51.627
THEY'RE BOTH MICE,

11:51.710 --> 11:53.421
AND THE OTHER MOUSE
WAS ALWAYS THE BEAUTIFUL ONE.

11:53.504 --> 11:56.424
- RIGHT, BUT THEN,
THEY SWITCHED.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.259
- SOUNDS INTERESTING.

11:58.342 --> 12:02.179
YOU KNOW, MICE DO WELL
IN FOCUS GROUPS.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.098
- MELANIE AND I ARE ARTISTS.

12:04.181 --> 12:05.808
WE DON'T CATER
TO FOCUS GROUPS.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.935
- AND HOW DOES
YOUR STORY END?

12:08.018 --> 12:12.940
- WELL, WHAT KIND OF ENDINGS
DO FOCUS GROUPS LIKE?

12:13.023 --> 12:16.318
- THE KIND THAT ARE IN MY HAND
BY MONDAY.

12:16.402 --> 12:19.113
- THEN YOU WILL HAVE IT
BY SUNDAY.

12:21.699 --> 12:24.243
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

12:27.746 --> 12:30.124
- I'M READY.
HOW DO I LOOK?

12:30.207 --> 12:32.501
- OH, YOU'LL BE
THE PRETTIEST MOUSE AT THE BALL.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.794
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, MOUSE?

12:33.878 --> 12:34.962
- UH, NOTHING.

12:35.045 --> 12:38.174
[horn honking]

12:38.257 --> 12:40.009
- SOUNDS LIKE
ELKA'S READY TO GO.

12:40.092 --> 12:42.011
DO YOU NEED A LIFT?
- NO, NO, NO.

12:42.094 --> 12:42.303
WE'RE GONNA WAIT FOR JOY.
YOU GO AHEAD WITHOUT US.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.309
- SO THE NEWLY BEAUTIFUL MOUSE
HEADED OFF TO THE BALL.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.102
- IT'S ALMOST TOO EASY.

12:50.186 --> 12:53.147
- NOW, WHAT'S OUR ENDING?

12:53.230 --> 12:55.357
- WE'LL FIND OUT AT THE BALL.
THE EARL IS THERE.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.526
THE TWO SISTERS
WILL VIE FOR HIM,

12:57.610 --> 13:00.196
AND THEN WHATEVER HAPPENS,
THAT'S THE ENDING TO OUR BOOK.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.198
- I'M NOT GOING.
both: WHAT?

13:02.281 --> 13:03.866
- NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.826
YOU CAN'T LET
A LITTLE THING

13:05.910 --> 13:07.411
LIKE A SCOOTER AND AN EYE PATCH
STOP YOU.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.206
- HOW ABOUT THIS?

13:10.289 --> 13:10.831
- [screams]

13:13.125 --> 13:14.835
- [lisping]
I KNOCKED MY CROWN OUT

13:14.919 --> 13:15.961
TRYING TO OPEN
MY EYE DROPS BOTTLE.

13:19.006 --> 13:20.716
- YOU CANNOT GIVE UP.

13:20.799 --> 13:22.718
- THIS WOULD BE
A TERRIBLE ENDING.

13:22.801 --> 13:24.386
WHERE WOULD CINDERELLA BE
IF SHE'D STAYED HOME

13:24.470 --> 13:26.388
AND FELT SORRY
FOR HERSELF

13:26.472 --> 13:28.224
WHEN HER SISTER
WAS OFF HAVING FUN AT THE BALL?

13:28.307 --> 13:30.351
- LOOK AT ME.
I'M HARDLY CINDERELLA.

13:34.647 --> 13:38.275
- VICTORIA, SHE'S RIGHT.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.569
JILL IS THE ONE
THAT GOT BEAUTIFUL.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.239
- OH, THAT'S TRUE.
YOU'VE HAD YOUR TIME.

13:43.322 --> 13:44.573
JILL'S CINDERELLA NOW.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.408
- SHUT UP!

13:46.492 --> 13:48.369
I'M CINDERELLA,
AND I'M GOING TO THE BALL.

13:48.452 --> 13:50.246
I JUST NEED YOU TO HELP ME

13:50.329 --> 13:51.205
LOOK PRETTY ENOUGH
TO CAPTURE A NOBLEMAN.

13:54.792 --> 13:57.378
- NO PROBLEM.

13:57.461 --> 13:59.505
THIS IS GONNA BE HARDER
THAN WRITING THE BOOK.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.930
- THE EARL OF CLEVELAND
IS GOING TO BE HERE ANY SECOND.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.724
I HOPE YOU MEMORIZED THE NAMES
OF THE DIGNITARIES.

14:10.808 --> 14:11.934
- OH, DON'T WORRY.

14:12.017 --> 14:15.437
I MADE A CHEAT SHEET.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.231
OH, NO.
- WHAT?

14:17.314 --> 14:20.734
- THESE ARE
MY FOOTBALL PICKS.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.820
- ELKA, WHAT WERE
YOU THINKING?

14:22.903 --> 14:25.656
- I KNOW.
RAVENS PLUS THREE?

14:28.409 --> 14:30.160
- HERE THEY COME.

14:30.244 --> 14:32.413
- OH, I'M SCREWED.
- DON'T PANIC.

14:32.496 --> 14:35.082
THE EARL HAS TO INTRODUCE
HIS PEOPLE TO YOU.

14:35.165 --> 14:37.960
JUST PAY ATTENTION
AND REPEAT WHAT HE SAYS.

14:38.043 --> 14:40.129
- COUNCILWOMAN OSTROVSKY,
A PLEASURE.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.464
THE MEMBERS OF MY PARTY:

14:42.548 --> 14:44.466
CHIEF MAGISTRATE
MARTIN PORTREEVE,

14:44.550 --> 14:46.594
LIEUTENANT COLONEL
RODSON HEATHCOTE-DRUMMOND,

14:46.677 --> 14:47.970
THE HONORABLE
MARTIN GLED-HEWESON,

14:48.053 --> 14:50.097
BISHOP OF LICHFIELD,

14:50.180 --> 14:53.183
LORD KEEPER OF THE PRIVY SEAL
LEMONDE OSWOLF-STICKET.

15:01.692 --> 15:05.821
- EVERYONE, PLEASE WELCOME
THE EARL OF CLEVELAND.

15:05.904 --> 15:07.823
[applause]

15:07.906 --> 15:13.495
AND WITH HIM
PLAIDSY,

15:13.579 --> 15:16.165
WAR MAN,

15:16.248 --> 15:19.501
CHURCHIE, AND...

15:19.585 --> 15:21.337
LEMONY SNICKET.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.136
- [chuckles]

15:29.219 --> 15:32.473
[laughter]

15:32.556 --> 15:34.141
I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE GREAT FUN

15:34.224 --> 15:35.142
DOING BUSINESS TOGETHER.

15:35.225 --> 15:36.685
[laughs]

15:36.769 --> 15:38.979
GENTLEMEN, PLEASE.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.649
- YOU DID IT, ELKA.
YOU'RE A HERO.

15:41.732 --> 15:44.318
- OH, SAVE IT
FOR THE REAL HEROES,

15:44.401 --> 15:47.237
THE RAVENS,
IF THEY COVER THE SPREAD.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.992
- OH, YOU LOOK
SO BEAUTIFUL.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.036
YOUR EYE PATCH
MATCHES YOUR GOWN.

15:54.119 --> 15:56.205
YOUR GOWN COVERS THE WHEELS
ON YOUR ORTHOPEDIC BOOT,

15:56.288 --> 15:57.831
AND THE SUPER GLUE
IS HOLDING PERFECTLY

15:57.915 --> 15:59.375
ON YOUR DEAD TOOTH.

15:59.458 --> 16:03.504
- I FEEL SO GLAMOROUS.

16:03.587 --> 16:06.173
DAMN IT.
JILL'S ALREADY WITH THE EARL.

16:06.256 --> 16:07.508
LOOK AT HER OVER THERE,

16:07.591 --> 16:10.594
SHAMELESSLY FLIRTING WITH HIM.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.471
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST GO HOME.

16:12.554 --> 16:14.515
- NO, YOU CAN'T.
THAT'S QUITTER TALK.

16:14.598 --> 16:15.808
IF YOU DON'T
GO DOWN FIGHTING,

16:15.891 --> 16:17.017
WHAT DOES THAT DO FOR US?

16:17.101 --> 16:20.521
WHO LOOK UP TO YOU.

16:20.604 --> 16:22.231
- WHAT'S THE USE?

16:22.314 --> 16:23.232
LOOK, HE'S ALREADY
INTERESTED IN--

16:23.315 --> 16:24.608
[shouts]

16:28.487 --> 16:29.697
HELLO.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.782
- YOU MOVE LIKE AN ANGEL,

16:31.865 --> 16:34.076
AS IF YOU WERE FLOATING
ACROSS THE ROOM.

16:34.159 --> 16:37.871
- THANK YOU FOR REMARKING
ON MY GRACE, YOUR GRACE.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.666
- AH.
BELUGA, MY FAVORITE.

16:40.749 --> 16:42.918
- I SIMPLY ADORE BELUGA.
- I ADORE IT MORE.

16:43.001 --> 16:44.378
MM-HMM.

16:44.461 --> 16:46.213
[groans]

16:46.296 --> 16:49.758
DELICIOUS.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.636
- POOR CHILD,
HAVE YOU NEVER HAD CAVIAR?

16:52.720 --> 16:55.139
YOU MUST BE SO SHELTERED
AND NAIVE.

16:55.222 --> 16:57.141
- WELL, I'M CERTAINLY
NOT AS WORLDLY

16:57.224 --> 16:59.101
AND EXPERIENCED
AS SOME.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.019
PERHAPS THE EARL WOULD LIKE
TO HEAR A STORY

17:01.103 --> 17:02.354
OF A WOMAN WHO'S BEEN RIDDEN
BY MORE MEN

17:02.438 --> 17:04.565
THAN THE LONDON UNDERGROUND.

17:04.647 --> 17:08.402
- OR PERHAPS THE EARL WOULD LIKE
TO SEE A RECENT PHOTO

17:08.484 --> 17:11.780
OF A WOMAN
WITH A MUSTACHE.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.575
- I'M NOT SURE
THAT I WOULD, ACTUALLY.

17:14.657 --> 17:16.285
- WHO DO YOU WANT THE EARL
TO END UP WITH,

17:16.367 --> 17:18.078
JOY MOUSE
OR JILL MOUSE?

17:18.162 --> 17:20.038
- OF COURSE
I'M ROOTING FOR JOY.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.832
- WELL, OBVIOUSLY
I'M ROOTING FOR JOY TOO.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.751
- BUT IT'S GONNA BE JILL.
- TOTALLY.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.669
I MEAN, WE'RE WRITING
A CHILDREN'S BOOK,

17:25.752 --> 17:29.131
NOT <i> HOW JOY MOUSE</i>
<i>GOT HER GROOVE BACK.</i>

17:29.214 --> 17:32.968
- AND THEN I SAID, "MIDDLETON?
I THOUGHT YOU SAID WIMBLEDON."

17:33.051 --> 17:35.471
[both laugh]

17:35.554 --> 17:36.680
- REMINDS ME OF THE TIME
I WAS INVITED

17:36.764 --> 17:37.639
TO THE DUCHESS OF--

17:37.723 --> 17:38.599
OH.

17:38.682 --> 17:40.392
- WHAT?

17:40.476 --> 17:42.519
DO I HAVE SOMETHING
ON MY TOOTH?

17:42.603 --> 17:45.439
- NO, QUITE THE OPPOSITE,
ACTUALLY.

17:45.522 --> 17:48.984
SEEMS YOU HAVE A TOOTH
ON YOUR SOMETHING.

17:49.067 --> 17:51.278
- OH.
EXCUSE ME, WON'T YOU?

17:55.574 --> 17:57.701
[shouts]

18:03.874 --> 18:05.793
- GOODNESS.

18:05.876 --> 18:08.462
THAT WOMAN'S A BIT
OF A DISASTER, ISN'T SHE?

18:08.545 --> 18:11.006
PERHAPS YOU AND I
COULD GO SOMEWHERE

18:11.089 --> 18:12.841
A LITTLE MORE PRIVATE.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.677
- [groans]

18:15.761 --> 18:16.720
- [sighs]

18:16.804 --> 18:18.514
I'D LOVE TO,

18:18.597 --> 18:20.182
BUT THAT DISASTER
IS MY SISTER,

18:20.265 --> 18:22.059
AND SHE NEEDS MY HELP.

18:22.142 --> 18:24.478
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME?

18:24.561 --> 18:26.355
- HONEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- ARE YOU HURT?

18:26.438 --> 18:29.149
- I'M FINE,
JUST HIDEOUSLY EMBARRASSED.

18:29.233 --> 18:32.194
- LET ME HELP.
- JILL, WHAT ABOUT THE EARL?

18:32.277 --> 18:34.196
- YOU TOOK A TUMBLE.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.365
IT'S MY TURN TO PICK YOU UP
AND DUST YOU OFF.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.075
ON YOUR FEET,
CABBAGE.

18:38.158 --> 18:40.327
- SHE LOOKS LIKE
A PIRATE.

18:40.410 --> 18:42.412
ALL THAT'S MISSING
IS A PARROT ON HER SHOULDER.

18:42.496 --> 18:46.416
- ALL THAT'S MISSING
IS MY FIST IN YOUR THROAT.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.002
- JILL, THAT'S SO SWEET.

18:51.755 --> 18:53.924
- LET'S SAVE THE SMILES
TILL WE GET HOME, SHALL WE?

18:54.007 --> 18:56.885
- THANK YOU.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.221
- THERE'S THE END
OF OUR STORY:

18:59.304 --> 19:01.223
THE SISTERS
CHOOSE EACH OTHER.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.809
- OH, I LOVE
THE WAY WE WRITE.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.359
- THANKS AGAIN
FOR LEAVING THE EARL FOR ME.

19:12.442 --> 19:14.403
- OH, WELL,
THERE ARE DOZENS OF ROYALS,

19:14.486 --> 19:16.405
BUT I ONLY HAVE ONE SISTER,

19:16.488 --> 19:19.074
AND THERE'LL BE OTHER MEN.

19:19.157 --> 19:21.577
PLEASE TELL ME SEX
IS BETTER THAN CAVIAR.

19:21.660 --> 19:22.953
- THEY'RE BOTH BETTER
WITH VODKA.

19:29.167 --> 19:33.088
BUT IF I COULD OFFER A PIECE
OF BIG SISTER ADVICE,

19:33.172 --> 19:36.091
WHEN IT COMES TO MEN,
BE PATIENT.

19:36.174 --> 19:38.093
YOU MAY HAVE TO KISS
A LOT FROGS

19:38.176 --> 19:40.470
BEFORE YOU FIND
YOUR PRINCE.

19:40.554 --> 19:41.847
