WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:04.569
I cannot believe
how quickly you were able
to pull this together, Vee.

00:04.613 --> 00:07.833
Turns out, there's a circuit
of crime conventions,

00:07.877 --> 00:11.315
plus the idea
of a serial killer
fan convention

00:11.359 --> 00:14.710
being held in Riverdale,
murder capital
of small town USA,

00:14.753 --> 00:17.147
is too delicious
for fans to pass up.

00:17.191 --> 00:20.107
We're selling tickets
to Slaughter-Con like crazy.

00:20.150 --> 00:22.718
So, there will be a crowd?

00:22.761 --> 00:25.416
Do you think that will keep
TBK away, Charles?

00:25.460 --> 00:27.853
Not if he and you
are the centerpieces
of the convention.

00:27.897 --> 00:30.291
Most serial killers
are narcissists.

00:30.334 --> 00:33.816
So, if yours is all about him,
he won't be able to resist it.

00:33.859 --> 00:35.296
He'll want to see
what all the fuss is about.

00:35.339 --> 00:37.167
How dangerous
is this going to be?

00:37.211 --> 00:40.301
I don't want
any more dead bodies
on my property.

00:40.344 --> 00:42.651
There's an unwritten rule
for serial killers,
don't kill where you eat.

00:42.694 --> 00:44.870
Plus, we love our fans.
We don't want to murder them.

00:44.914 --> 00:47.351
Well, sounds like
those attending

00:47.395 --> 00:49.440
and those working
at the con will be safe.

00:49.484 --> 00:51.790
But what about you, Bee?

00:51.834 --> 00:54.184
I mean, you're the Clarice
to TBK's Hannibal Lecter.

00:55.664 --> 00:57.970
He sees us as kindred spirits,

00:58.014 --> 01:01.104
so that should offer me
a little bit of protection.

01:01.148 --> 01:03.150
And we'll have an agent
stationed outside the house

01:03.193 --> 01:05.108
to make sure that
Charles and my mom are safe.

01:05.152 --> 01:06.370
Otherwise, I'll be close by.

01:06.414 --> 01:08.155
Well, I will be too.

01:08.198 --> 01:10.592
TBK doesn't know that
he's not in my blind spot anymore.

01:10.635 --> 01:13.116
I should be able
to pick him out of a crowd.

01:13.160 --> 01:16.772
Well, I've pretty much
finalized our event schedule.

01:16.815 --> 01:20.428
Dr. Curdle
will be performing
a simulated autopsy.

01:20.471 --> 01:23.605
Agent Drake will be giving
a symposium on...

01:23.648 --> 01:24.649
Hybristophilia.

01:24.693 --> 01:26.782
Whatever that is.

01:26.825 --> 01:30.351
We'll be hosting panels
for the Black Hood
and the Starkweathers.

01:30.394 --> 01:32.266
A Gryphon and Gargoyles tournament.

01:32.309 --> 01:34.442
And, of course,
for the main event,

01:34.485 --> 01:37.793
a one-on-one sit down
with the Girl in the Well,

01:37.836 --> 01:40.622
TBK's most famous survivor.

01:40.665 --> 01:41.971
What about live entertainment?

01:42.014 --> 01:43.668
Have you booked an act yet?

01:43.712 --> 01:45.975
Yes. Kevin will be presenting
a few musical numbers

01:46.018 --> 01:48.760
from the Holy Grail
of serial killer musicals.

01:48.804 --> 01:51.415
<i>- Sweeney Todd?</i>
- Alas, no.

01:51.459 --> 01:54.244
<i>American Psycho,</i> based on
the Bret Easton Ellis novel,

01:54.288 --> 01:56.072
with songs by Duncan Sheik.

01:56.116 --> 01:59.206
I made Kevin promise me
that he would push the envelope

01:59.249 --> 02:01.208
with the staging
and choreography.

02:01.251 --> 02:03.688
Make it all
very '80s club glamfab.

02:08.998 --> 02:12.132
Mr. Andrews' strike
has upended my schedule somewhat,

02:12.175 --> 02:15.918
and failure is not an option.

02:15.961 --> 02:19.487
In one month's time,
Bailey's Comet
will pass over this fair town,

02:19.530 --> 02:21.619
and we'd better get
the railroad built by then.

02:21.663 --> 02:25.971
Otherwise, we'll have to wait
another 65 years
for its return.

02:26.015 --> 02:28.060
What does a comet
have to do
with your railway?

02:28.104 --> 02:31.194
Well, Bailey's Comet possesses
unique celestial energies

02:31.238 --> 02:32.674
that will benefit me
in my plans.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.197
So, mind-control the strikers.

02:35.372 --> 02:36.460
You can do that, can't you?

02:36.504 --> 02:37.722
Of course I can.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.857
I heard back
from the union delegate,

02:41.900 --> 02:43.728
and they are supporting
our strike,

02:43.772 --> 02:44.990
which means they're
setting up a relief fund

02:45.034 --> 02:46.514
to help cover living expenses

02:46.557 --> 02:47.819
for any worker
on the picket line.

02:47.863 --> 02:49.212
That's right.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.997
And until the work fund
is activated,

02:52.041 --> 02:56.480
all of you and your families
can eat at Pop's for free.

02:58.482 --> 02:59.875
We're in this together.

03:02.094 --> 03:03.618
Thanks for providing
those meals, Tabitha.

03:03.661 --> 03:04.488
It makes a difference.

03:06.011 --> 03:07.361
Of course.

03:07.404 --> 03:10.929
Plus, honestly,
anything to keep busy.

03:10.973 --> 03:12.192
How's Chuck doing, do you know?

03:12.235 --> 03:14.498
He's still in the bunker,

03:14.542 --> 03:17.066
still trying
to quiet the voices
he's hearing.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.160
He's not drinking again, is he?

03:24.204 --> 03:26.031
No. No, definitely not.

03:26.075 --> 03:27.468
Well, that's good, then.

03:27.511 --> 03:31.994
He'll be okay. He's strong.
He'll beat this.

03:32.037 --> 03:33.952
<i>Pray tell. What can I</i> <i>
do for you?</i>

03:33.996 --> 03:35.650
Tell me.

03:35.693 --> 03:38.870
Well, I wanted you
to hear this from me.

03:38.914 --> 03:40.220
Fangs and I
are getting married.

03:43.440 --> 03:46.574
My, my, my.
Cupid's been
awfully busy lately.

03:48.837 --> 03:53.711
Ah! Toni,
meet my friend Heather.

03:53.755 --> 03:56.018
Hello.

03:56.061 --> 04:00.805
Is this the Heather
you had told me about
from back in the day?

04:00.849 --> 04:03.808
- Your first--
- Indeed.

04:03.852 --> 04:06.637
Heather and I
recently reconnected.

04:06.681 --> 04:10.728
I had no idea.
Well, I'm...
I'm happy for you.

04:10.772 --> 04:13.209
Um, well, I didn't know
you had company,

04:13.253 --> 04:14.950
so I'll get out of your hair,

04:14.993 --> 04:16.604
but I wanted to let you know

04:16.647 --> 04:18.736
that I'm having a little
bachelorette girls night out,

04:18.780 --> 04:21.043
dancing at the Babylonium.

04:21.086 --> 04:24.002
We're gonna crash
Veronica's after hours
dance party

04:24.046 --> 04:25.221
at the serial killer convention.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.657
How apropos.

04:26.701 --> 04:28.920
I would love it if you came.
Both of you.

04:33.185 --> 04:34.274
Cheryl,
how are you feeling?

04:37.189 --> 04:39.366
Do you wanna talk
about Toni's visit?

04:40.323 --> 04:42.238
Whatever for?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.849
Your ex-girlfriend
just told you
she's getting married.

04:44.893 --> 04:46.416
It would be completely normal

04:46.460 --> 04:48.331
if you felt strange
or upset about it.

04:49.071 --> 04:49.985
Well,

04:51.943 --> 04:55.338
I am anything
but completely normal, Heather.

04:55.382 --> 04:57.340
So, spare me
your unsolicited advice,

04:57.384 --> 05:00.169
and stop building
a false narrative
about what I'm feeling,

05:00.212 --> 05:01.779
because
the fact of the matter is,
I'm fine.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.189
God, I hope
this was a good idea.

05:23.714 --> 05:26.282
Welcome,
foul fiends and friends,

05:26.326 --> 05:29.981
to our first annual
serial killer fan convention,

05:30.025 --> 05:31.113
Slaughter-Con!

05:34.246 --> 05:36.161
To kick things off,

05:36.205 --> 05:38.338
the Babylonium
is proud to present
a little amuse-bouche

05:38.381 --> 05:40.557
from <i>American Psycho,</i>
the musical.

05:42.951 --> 05:44.648
So without further ado,

05:44.692 --> 05:47.608
please welcome
Riverdale's very own
Kevin Keller

05:47.651 --> 05:51.046
as investment banker by day,
serial killer by night,

05:51.089 --> 05:53.178
Mr. Patrick Bateman.

Why do you have this?

07:22.050 --> 07:23.834
That knife
belonged to your father,
the Black Hood.

07:24.792 --> 07:25.923
I bought it on eSlay.

07:25.967 --> 07:27.751
Why did you bring it here?

07:27.795 --> 07:29.492
I... I wanted you
to sign it for me.

07:31.059 --> 07:32.408
You wanted her autograph?

07:32.452 --> 07:34.062
You're my hero, Betty Cooper.

07:34.105 --> 07:35.193
Hero?

07:35.237 --> 07:37.065
You're practically one of them.

07:37.935 --> 07:39.589
What did you just say?

07:39.633 --> 07:42.157
I would be honored to be
your first official kill, but--

07:42.200 --> 07:43.332
- Enough, we're done, come on.
- Hey!

07:43.375 --> 07:44.594
Come on.

07:44.638 --> 07:49.512
<i>♪ I am something other than</i>

07:49.556 --> 07:51.253

07:51.296 --> 07:54.343

08:10.577 --> 08:11.621
Hello, citizens.

08:13.928 --> 08:16.452
Enjoying
your free meals, I see.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.367
Good.

08:18.410 --> 08:19.586
You'll need all your energy

08:21.152 --> 08:23.154
when you resume work
on my railroad,

08:24.808 --> 08:25.983
immediately.

08:26.027 --> 08:27.637
Not a snowball's chance
in hell.

08:31.249 --> 08:33.121
Mr. Fogarty.

08:33.164 --> 08:35.166
You will walk out that door,

08:36.516 --> 08:38.126
but you will return to work.

08:49.616 --> 08:51.618
You will all return to work

08:54.490 --> 08:56.187
now.

09:10.767 --> 09:13.988
So, what is hybristophilia?

09:15.555 --> 09:17.731
Clinically speaking,

09:17.774 --> 09:21.473
it's the term for when
someone is attracted
to a murderer or a criminal.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.214
Basically, it's a kink.

09:23.258 --> 09:26.609
The person is turned on
by evildoing and law-breaking.

09:26.653 --> 09:29.481
It may sound abnormal,
but there are some people

09:29.525 --> 09:32.049
who just have
this innate attraction

09:32.093 --> 09:34.661
to the darker,
more taboo side of life.

09:34.704 --> 09:36.227
It's actually
a common phenomenon...

09:36.271 --> 09:37.620
Listen, to each their own,

09:37.664 --> 09:39.535
I'm not judging anyone
or anything,

09:39.579 --> 09:41.755
but that's kind of weird,
right?

09:41.798 --> 09:45.759
I mean, who would be that drawn
to that kind of thing?

09:45.802 --> 09:47.674
I don't know.

09:51.112 --> 09:52.983
Hey, Tabitha, what's up?

09:53.027 --> 09:55.725
<i>I've got Toni here with me,</i> <i>
but they're gone, Archie.</i>

09:55.769 --> 09:58.075
<i>Every single crew member</i> <i>
left the diner</i>

09:58.119 --> 10:00.164
<i>to go back to work</i> <i>
for Percival.</i>

10:09.609 --> 10:10.566
Cheryl.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.220
Why am I not surprised?

10:12.263 --> 10:13.874
Have you heard the good news
about Toni and Fangs?

10:13.917 --> 10:17.007
Yes. My lawyer just gave me
the super fun update.

10:17.051 --> 10:18.748
In that case,

10:18.792 --> 10:21.838
would you like to join me
in cursing their unholy union?

10:23.361 --> 10:24.972
<i>I went by the sight.</i>

10:25.015 --> 10:26.974
The guys
didn't even acknowledge
that I was there.

10:27.017 --> 10:28.279
They're working like robots.

10:28.323 --> 10:29.890
Same with Fangs.

10:29.933 --> 10:31.892
Percival's definitely
mind-controlling them now,

10:31.935 --> 10:34.851
which begs the question,
why did he wait so long?

10:34.895 --> 10:36.679
Maybe it's harder for Percival

10:36.723 --> 10:39.421
to control
larger groups of people
at the same time.

10:39.464 --> 10:42.163
Well, if you're right,
we might be able
to break his hold on the crew.

10:42.206 --> 10:43.338
And we could figure out
a tether

10:43.381 --> 10:45.732
that could break
Percival's spell.

10:45.775 --> 10:47.690
Fangs said his tether
would be Baby Anthony.

10:47.734 --> 10:48.822
Well,
that makes sense.

10:48.865 --> 10:50.258
These guys love their families.

10:50.301 --> 10:51.868
That's why
they're busting their asses

10:51.912 --> 10:53.783
to provide for them,
their children.

10:53.827 --> 10:56.612
So we remind them
what they're striking for.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.440
Better lives
for their loved ones.

11:00.094 --> 11:02.879
And I have an idea
for how to do that.

11:02.923 --> 11:06.404
Songs have always been
a big part
of the labor movement,

11:06.448 --> 11:09.407
used to create solidarity
amongst the workers.

11:09.451 --> 11:11.801
Archie,
you have the contact info

11:11.845 --> 11:14.151
for everyone
on Percival's crew, right?

11:14.891 --> 11:17.241
And a guitar.

11:23.073 --> 11:24.553
According to
the Maleficarum,

11:24.596 --> 11:27.251
this is the opposite
of a love spell, Kev-Kev.

11:27.295 --> 11:28.862
This is a wedge spell

11:28.905 --> 11:32.343
meant to drive a wedge
between lovers, obviously.

11:32.387 --> 11:33.997
Uh, what's the wedge?

11:34.041 --> 11:35.869
I'm leaving those details
for the universe to decide.

11:41.265 --> 11:44.094
"I implore you, spirits,
to curse these lovers,

11:44.138 --> 11:46.227
Antoinette Topaz
and Fangs Fogarty,

11:46.270 --> 11:47.750
with feelings of acrimony,

11:47.794 --> 11:49.752
acerbity and vexation
towards one another.

11:49.796 --> 11:52.363
May this drive a wedge
between them
for all eternity."

11:54.626 --> 11:56.716
<i>What the hell</i> <i>
do you all want?</i>

11:56.759 --> 11:59.414
We know
what Percival is doing
to this crew, Uncle Frank,

11:59.457 --> 12:00.937
controlling
and manipulating them.

12:00.981 --> 12:04.158
So, we and their families
are here in solidarity

12:04.201 --> 12:05.768
to break Percival's spell,

12:05.812 --> 12:08.553
and remind them
that we stand together.

12:08.597 --> 12:09.859
And that we support them

12:09.903 --> 12:11.600
and believe in
what they fight for,

12:11.643 --> 12:13.254
which is a better life for them
and their families.

12:13.297 --> 12:15.560
Oh, yeah?
What's the guitar for?

12:17.519 --> 12:21.566
<i>♪ As we go marching, marching</i>

12:21.610 --> 12:25.919

Fogarty, what the hell
are you doing?
Get back to work.

12:35.363 --> 12:38.322

that's it, you're done.

Day one down,
and no TBK sightings.

13:24.673 --> 13:27.241
There's still plenty of time
for him to make an entrance.

13:27.284 --> 13:29.112
The main event
isn't till tomorrow after all.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.724
By the way,
where's the boyfriend?

13:32.768 --> 13:35.118
Is this all
a little too much for him?

13:35.162 --> 13:39.296
Uh, he had some union stuff
to take care of.

13:39.340 --> 13:40.950
But, yeah,
he might have been
a little weirded out

13:40.994 --> 13:43.300
by your symposium.

13:44.432 --> 13:45.389
I get that.

13:48.044 --> 13:50.003
Uh, listen, Betty.

13:50.046 --> 13:51.047
I'm just gonna say it.

13:54.703 --> 13:55.835
I'm attracted to you.

13:56.923 --> 13:57.880
Oh, wow.

13:57.924 --> 14:00.013
Okay.

14:00.056 --> 14:03.364
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm... I'm flattered.

14:04.191 --> 14:06.410
But I'm with Archie.

14:06.454 --> 14:08.499
Hmm,
is that an exclusive thing?

14:09.892 --> 14:12.677
Yeah, it is.

14:12.721 --> 14:16.812
I hear you. I... I guess
I was just thinking
that you guys are so different,

14:16.856 --> 14:19.206
and we have so much in common.

14:19.249 --> 14:21.904
Archie is cut
from a different cloth, yeah.

14:21.948 --> 14:25.690
And maybe I've been
totally misreading things,

14:25.734 --> 14:29.869
but I swear I've been
picking up vibes from you.

14:31.479 --> 14:32.828
Vibes from me?

14:32.872 --> 14:33.785
Yeah.

14:35.309 --> 14:36.919
Tell me,

14:36.963 --> 14:38.225
am I wrong about that, Betty?

14:47.495 --> 14:48.844
Morning,
Agent Cooper.

14:50.324 --> 14:51.281
How'd you sleep?

15:05.513 --> 15:07.036
<i>When do you wanna</i> <i>
head over to the Babylonium?</i>

15:07.080 --> 15:08.603
Soonish.

15:08.646 --> 15:11.301
Um, you know,
you don't have to come, Arch.

15:11.345 --> 15:15.784
I'm 100% fine going alone.
There's tons of security.

15:15.827 --> 15:18.830
Well, it wouldn't be bad for me
to check on the crew.

15:18.874 --> 15:21.398
The condos
kind of freak me out.

15:21.442 --> 15:22.704
Maybe I'll take
part of the day off.

15:24.314 --> 15:25.228
That's totally fine.

15:26.838 --> 15:27.752
It's fine.

15:32.409 --> 15:33.584
<i>Bonjour,</i> Fangs.

15:33.628 --> 15:35.673
I was in the neighborhood,

15:35.717 --> 15:37.153
and thought I could drop off
some freshly baked
cherry muffins.

15:37.197 --> 15:40.287
Oh, uh, right now
is not a good time, Cheryl.

15:40.330 --> 15:42.202
It's okay, Fangs.
You can let her in.

15:42.898 --> 15:43.768
Mmm.

15:48.077 --> 15:49.513
Oh, my, T.T.

15:50.906 --> 15:52.429
Is something the matter?

15:52.473 --> 15:55.432
Baby Anthony's been up
crying for hours.

15:55.476 --> 15:56.825
The doctor thinks it's colic.

15:56.868 --> 15:59.784
We barely just got him
down to sleep.

15:59.828 --> 16:01.917
He started running a fever.
It's so weird.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.614
He's never been like this.

16:04.876 --> 16:06.313
I see.

16:06.356 --> 16:10.317
And when did you
first notice this affliction?

16:10.360 --> 16:12.710
Yesterday afternoon-ish.

16:12.754 --> 16:15.800
I think
we're gonna have to cancel
the bachelorette dance party,

16:15.844 --> 16:17.106
at least until we figure out

16:17.150 --> 16:18.847
what's going on
with Baby Anthony.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.762
Of course. Let me know
if there's anything I can do.

16:25.027 --> 16:27.595
Wait, Baby Anthony is a wedge?
That wasn't supposed to happen.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.118
Of course not, Kevin.

16:29.162 --> 16:30.946
But we didn't specify
what the wedge should be.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.600
This is your fault.

16:32.643 --> 16:34.471
Oh, my God,
I'm never gonna
forgive myself

16:34.515 --> 16:36.038
if we hurt that baby.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.388
Isn't there someone
we can call? An expert?

16:39.694 --> 16:42.958
So, she professed her love
for you,

16:43.002 --> 16:45.047
like,
out of some romance novel?

16:45.091 --> 16:47.702
That's unprofessional.

16:47.745 --> 16:49.051
Yeah, tell me about it.

16:52.141 --> 16:55.579
- But it's made me start to think...
- Uh-oh.

16:55.623 --> 16:58.626
The truth is
I compartmentalize
with Archie.

16:58.669 --> 17:01.890
I don't talk about work.

17:01.933 --> 17:04.414
I have dark thoughts,
but I don't go there with him.

17:07.069 --> 17:08.375
With Drake,

17:08.418 --> 17:11.204
I don't feel the need
to censor myself.

17:11.247 --> 17:17.384
Yeah, but Betty,
everyone compartmentalizes
with everyone.

17:17.427 --> 17:20.691
Thus,
I don't see a problem here.

17:20.735 --> 17:23.303
I mean, it's not like
you're actually attracted
to Drake.

17:24.391 --> 17:25.348
Wait.

17:27.133 --> 17:30.136
Betty Cooper,
are you hot for Agent Drake?

17:30.179 --> 17:31.354
No.

17:33.791 --> 17:35.271
But I did have a dream
about her.

17:36.664 --> 17:40.885
And yeah, on paper,
we're compatible.

17:40.929 --> 17:42.104
Can I give you some advice?

17:44.802 --> 17:47.370
A, don't go there with Drake,

17:48.154 --> 17:49.068
and B,

17:49.894 --> 17:50.939
talk to Archie.

17:52.723 --> 17:55.378
Many of my relationships
have ended sadly

17:55.422 --> 17:59.078
because we didn't have
the convos we needed to have,

18:00.470 --> 18:01.558
or we had them too late.

18:02.255 --> 18:03.169
Okay.

18:04.213 --> 18:05.127
Thank you, Vee.

18:05.171 --> 18:06.172
I appreciate it.

18:09.914 --> 18:12.091
Drake? Hi.

18:12.134 --> 18:13.918
- May we have a word?
- Sure. What's up?

18:13.962 --> 18:16.965
Look, Betty's going through
a lot right now,

18:17.008 --> 18:21.883
and you confessing
your attraction to her,
not cool.

18:21.926 --> 18:24.364
So here's a thought.

18:24.407 --> 18:26.148
Why don't you focus
on your work,

18:26.192 --> 18:28.150
keep your libido to yourself,

18:28.194 --> 18:30.935
and let my friend
figure out her stuff.

18:30.979 --> 18:32.415
Sound good?

18:32.459 --> 18:33.373
Absolutely.

18:34.591 --> 18:35.679
If you'll excuse me.

18:45.211 --> 18:49.519
Well, that should take care
of the, um, colic.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.478
He's sleeping so soundly.

18:51.521 --> 18:53.349
Thank you so much
for coming, Heather.

18:53.393 --> 18:56.396
- We were literally dying.
- Not at all.

18:56.439 --> 18:59.399
As I said to Cheryl
when she called,
I'm happy to help.

18:59.442 --> 19:02.576
And as a registered midwife
and night nurse,

19:02.619 --> 19:04.969
I know a little something
about crying babies.

19:05.013 --> 19:07.189
And what you gave him
was literally just...

19:07.233 --> 19:10.149
Just a calming tonic
that Heather concocted
in the greenhouse.

19:10.192 --> 19:12.629
It must be the calming perfume
I concocted in my greenhouse.

19:12.673 --> 19:14.240
With a spoonful of sugar.

19:14.283 --> 19:15.589
Oldest trick in the bock.

19:15.632 --> 19:18.940
Thank you.
Thank you so so much.

19:18.983 --> 19:21.072
Yeah. Thank you, Heather.

19:23.423 --> 19:25.338
Basically,
when I was in the Well,

19:25.381 --> 19:28.210
TBK gave me a choice.

19:28.254 --> 19:30.212
If I dismembered the body,

19:31.866 --> 19:34.434
if I proved that
we were kindred spirits,

19:34.477 --> 19:37.088
then he would let me go.

19:37.132 --> 19:38.481
And what did you do?

19:41.745 --> 19:42.964
I did it.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.666
And it's haunted me
every day since.

19:49.710 --> 19:52.756
A devastating account
from a formidable survivor.

19:52.800 --> 19:56.804
Now, I'd like to open it up
to questions from our audience.

19:56.847 --> 19:59.981
Yes, you,
with the Black Dahlia T-shirt.

20:00.024 --> 20:03.811
First of all, I just wanna say
you're so brave and amazing.

20:07.075 --> 20:08.424
Did you have a question?

20:08.468 --> 20:09.773
I just want to know,

20:09.817 --> 20:11.906
why do serial killers
wear masks?

20:11.949 --> 20:15.997
Generally,
masks can help a killer

20:16.040 --> 20:18.782
disassociate
from the violent act
he's committing,

20:18.826 --> 20:20.784
help eliminate any shame

20:20.828 --> 20:22.786
that they might
eventually feel.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.005
Fascinating.

20:26.181 --> 20:27.791
Looks like we have a caller.

20:33.319 --> 20:36.974
Hi. You're on with Alice
and Betty Cooper. Live.

20:37.018 --> 20:38.846
What's your question?

20:38.889 --> 20:41.283
<i>Tell us, pretty Betty,</i>

20:41.327 --> 20:43.372
<i>why do you wear a mask?</i>

20:46.462 --> 20:47.463
I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:47.507 --> 20:49.073
I'm not wearing a mask.

20:49.117 --> 20:51.250
<i>Oh, Betty, don't lie.</i>

20:51.293 --> 20:53.208
<i>You're wearing a mask</i> <i>
right now.</i>

20:53.252 --> 20:55.558
<i>A human mask.</i>

20:55.602 --> 20:57.734
<i>But I've seen underneath it.</i>

20:57.778 --> 21:00.476
<i>Your true face</i> <i>
when you cut up that body,</i>

21:00.520 --> 21:02.696
<i>and it was beautiful.</i>

21:02.739 --> 21:05.264
Ladies and gentlemen,

21:05.307 --> 21:09.790
I believe we have TBK,
the Trash Bag Killer himself
on the line.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.141
<i>What is all this, Betty,</i>

21:13.184 --> 21:15.491
<i>this convention</i> <i>
you're putting on?</i>

21:15.535 --> 21:18.059
If you wanna share
your side of the story, TBK,

21:18.102 --> 21:21.149
why don't you
join me on the stage
if you're here?

21:21.192 --> 21:23.760
<i>This pathetic attempt</i> <i>
to entrap me</i>

21:23.804 --> 21:26.023
<i>is beneath you, Betty.</i>

21:26.067 --> 21:28.765
<i>And if you did catch me,</i> <i>
then what?</i>

21:28.809 --> 21:30.941
<i>Would you lay down your sword,</i>

21:30.985 --> 21:34.510
<i>move into a house</i> <i>
with a white picket fence</i> <i>
and a red door</i>

21:34.554 --> 21:40.168
<i>with your handsome,</i> <i>
all-American boyfriend</i> <i>
in this sleepy, quiet town.</i>

21:40.211 --> 21:42.083
<i>Do you think</i> <i>
that's how this ends?</i>

21:42.126 --> 21:45.347
Maybe. Maybe it does.

21:45.391 --> 21:47.088
<i>No, Betty.</i>

21:47.131 --> 21:51.832
<i>It ends with you and me</i> <i>
and a kiss in the dark.</i>

21:51.875 --> 21:54.835
No. No, you're wrong.
That's not how--

22:06.107 --> 22:08.283
One of the most
important lessons

22:08.327 --> 22:09.676
I can impart to you as a witch

22:09.719 --> 22:11.373
is to never cast a spell

22:11.417 --> 22:13.332
when you're in
an emotionally volatile state.

22:14.376 --> 22:15.682
It always backfires.

22:15.725 --> 22:16.987
Noted.

22:17.031 --> 22:18.554
So, now
do you wanna talk about

22:18.598 --> 22:19.816
what you're so
churned up about?

22:21.731 --> 22:23.646
Is it Toni's wedding?

22:23.690 --> 22:24.691
In truth...

22:30.566 --> 22:32.568
part of me
was holding on to
the idea that

22:32.612 --> 22:36.267
Toni and I
were fated to reunite.

22:36.311 --> 22:39.836
Realizing otherwise
was admittedly cutting,

22:39.880 --> 22:41.142
but also,

22:42.796 --> 22:47.017
I think it's... you.

22:48.628 --> 22:50.760
It's plain as day
that I'm drawn to you.

22:52.675 --> 22:54.111
I don't wanna get hurt again.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.159
I understand your apprehension.

23:00.074 --> 23:03.164
But Cheryl, all I know is that
we're getting a second chance.

23:03.207 --> 23:06.123
Let's just have fun,

23:07.603 --> 23:09.126
see what happens.

23:09.170 --> 23:14.131
Well, there is
Toni's bachelorette party.

23:14.175 --> 23:15.655
Veronica invited the girls over

23:15.698 --> 23:17.613
to get ready
in one of her champagne suites.

23:18.919 --> 23:20.964
We could possibly do that.

23:23.619 --> 23:27.710
In honor of this being
one of Toni's final outings
as a single woman,

23:27.754 --> 23:29.582
the absinthe is flowing.

23:29.625 --> 23:32.759
I had Katie Keane
send us these chic dresses
from Lacy's.

23:32.802 --> 23:35.631
So ladies, dig in, drink up

23:35.675 --> 23:39.374

This is part of my act.

27:29.082 --> 27:30.170
Dr. Curdle?

27:36.263 --> 27:39.092
<i>I thought we knew</i> <i>
how to party in Greendale,</i>

27:39.135 --> 27:41.877
but you Riverdale girls
really put us to shame.

27:43.749 --> 27:46.229
You know,
if you could spare a moment,

27:46.273 --> 27:48.797
I would really love
to show you something.

27:53.497 --> 27:54.673
Cheryl, it's...

27:56.326 --> 27:57.588
It's us

27:58.981 --> 28:00.026
from when we first met.

28:01.157 --> 28:02.724
I painted it a while back.

28:03.682 --> 28:04.857
It's breathtaking.

28:07.294 --> 28:08.643
Thank you.

28:08.687 --> 28:09.644
You know,

28:11.864 --> 28:14.736
I had more fun tonight

28:14.780 --> 28:18.914

in a really, really long time.

28:39.674 --> 28:41.458
I didn't hear you
come in last night.

28:43.547 --> 28:46.768
Seem like
you guys had a lot of fun.

28:46.812 --> 28:50.729
Yeah, a lot of dancing
and drinking.

28:53.906 --> 28:55.298
And I saw TBK.

28:55.342 --> 28:56.430
Wait, what?

28:56.473 --> 28:57.997
I'm fine.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.912
He slipped away
before I could get too close.

28:59.955 --> 29:02.566
And what does this mean
for the last day
of the convention?

29:02.610 --> 29:05.918
Well, Kevin is bailing
on his final performance

29:05.961 --> 29:08.485
because I messed up his vision.

29:08.529 --> 29:10.183
So, I'm actually gonna step in.

29:10.226 --> 29:11.358
To perform?

29:13.316 --> 29:16.711
It's the perfect opportunity
to use myself as bait.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.974
Once I start singing,
he'll be drawn to me.

29:19.018 --> 29:21.281
Agent Drake and Veronica
are gonna lock all the doors

29:21.324 --> 29:23.109
in and out of the casino.

29:23.152 --> 29:27.548
If TBK is there,
he won't get away this time.

29:27.591 --> 29:31.247
And I'm guessing
if I tell you
that this is crazy

29:31.291 --> 29:33.597
and dangerous,

29:33.641 --> 29:35.034
you're still gonna
go through with it.

29:36.470 --> 29:38.428
This is who I am, Arch.

29:39.516 --> 29:41.214
This is what I do.

29:41.257 --> 29:43.303
And you have to be
okay with that.

29:46.436 --> 29:48.221
Or not.

29:48.264 --> 29:50.876
But I have been thinking about
what he said on the phone

29:50.919 --> 29:56.751
yesterday about houses
and picket fences.

29:59.058 --> 30:02.975
And Toni getting married
and our pregnancy scare and...

30:05.978 --> 30:09.024
The truth is, Arch,
I don't really know

30:09.068 --> 30:11.026
if I want any of those things.

30:14.247 --> 30:15.639
But I know that you do.

30:16.466 --> 30:18.294
I do.

30:18.338 --> 30:20.122
So is that
a deal breaker, then?

30:20.166 --> 30:23.691
Because I know it was
for you and Veronica once.

30:23.734 --> 30:26.085
Maybe we should
talk about this tonight.

30:26.128 --> 30:28.652
When you're home,
after you've caught TBK.

30:28.696 --> 30:30.350
I'll be at Pop's with the crew.

30:30.393 --> 30:31.873
unless you want me
at the casino.

30:31.917 --> 30:33.483
I do.

30:33.527 --> 30:36.486
But it might keep TBK away.

30:37.705 --> 30:39.141
I'll be protected, though.

30:39.185 --> 30:40.708
And whatever happens,
I'll come back here

30:40.751 --> 30:41.665
and I'll text you.

30:45.321 --> 30:47.846
<i>Archie and I had</i> <i>
that talk that you suggested.</i>

30:48.672 --> 30:50.152
Okay, and?

30:51.937 --> 30:53.590
And I don't know.

30:53.634 --> 30:55.592
I don't know.
We'll just keep talking.

30:55.636 --> 30:59.858
But I'm worried that
we're just too different, Vee.

30:59.901 --> 31:01.685
That I'm too dark for him.

31:02.730 --> 31:04.036
Too dark? Betty...

31:04.863 --> 31:06.342
By my count...

31:06.386 --> 31:10.477
I've killed more people
than you.

31:10.520 --> 31:15.047
My husband and my father,
both in cold blood.

31:15.090 --> 31:16.613
- Geraldo accidently.
- Okay. Yeah.

31:16.657 --> 31:18.354
You don't need
to go there, Vee.

31:18.398 --> 31:20.313
Okay, my point is...

31:20.356 --> 31:23.403
We're all dark in Riverdale,
all right?

31:23.446 --> 31:25.622
And Archie's a big boy.

31:25.666 --> 31:27.537
You'd be surprised
what he can handle.

31:27.581 --> 31:29.148
And shouldn't it be
his decision anyway?

31:30.889 --> 31:32.412
Agent Cooper.

31:32.455 --> 31:34.022
Veronica.

31:34.066 --> 31:36.024
We have a situation
on our hands in the office.

31:39.593 --> 31:40.986
He had that gun on him.

31:44.511 --> 31:45.773
The Black Hood's.

31:46.469 --> 31:48.123
My father's.

31:48.167 --> 31:50.691
Will you sign it so I can
complete my collection?

31:50.734 --> 31:52.649
No! You psycho.

31:52.693 --> 31:55.261
Do you know how many people
he shot with that?

31:55.304 --> 31:57.219
Killed with that gun?

31:57.263 --> 31:59.004
Consider it confiscated.

31:59.047 --> 32:00.701
And you're lucky
we're not arresting you

32:00.744 --> 32:02.746
for carrying a weapon
without a permit.

32:02.790 --> 32:04.661
Drake, can you please
get him out of my sight?

32:04.705 --> 32:05.967
I have a show to prepare for.

32:06.011 --> 32:07.360
Of course. Come on.

32:25.856 --> 32:27.119
I'm so sorry, Bee.

32:29.469 --> 32:30.992
Me too.

32:31.036 --> 32:33.995
I thought TBK would come,
and that this would work.

32:34.039 --> 32:36.432
Well, he should have been here.

32:36.476 --> 32:38.869
Your song was worth
risking the electric chair.

32:40.871 --> 32:42.830
We'll get him next time.

32:42.873 --> 32:45.920
Well, anything I can do
to help, of course.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.575
And let me know how
round two goes with Archie.

32:48.618 --> 32:50.055
I will, Vee. Thank you.

32:56.626 --> 32:57.932
I should head out, too.

32:59.499 --> 33:01.022
Get home safe.

33:01.066 --> 33:03.024
Veronica was right, by the way.

33:03.068 --> 33:05.374
You were incredible.

33:05.418 --> 33:06.897
I gotta ask, though.

33:06.941 --> 33:08.334
That... song.

33:09.465 --> 33:10.466
Who were you singing about?

33:11.467 --> 33:14.296
Archie or... TBK?

33:17.386 --> 33:18.518
Have a goodnight, Drake.

I did.

You're under arrest.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.979
Get on your knees
and take off your mask.

35:56.850 --> 35:58.765
Put yours on.

35:58.808 --> 36:01.768
Stop denying who you truly are.

36:02.421 --> 36:03.465
One of us.

36:04.510 --> 36:07.730
an American psycho.

36:07.774 --> 36:10.820
Do you know how many
people have said that to me
over the years?

36:11.908 --> 36:14.215
Including my father...

36:14.259 --> 36:18.088
Who first started grooming me
in this garage.

36:18.132 --> 36:20.221
You have two options.

36:20.265 --> 36:21.570
One...

36:21.614 --> 36:23.833
You kill me
with your father s gun.

36:23.877 --> 36:25.487
Two...

36:25.531 --> 36:28.751
You and I claim the victims
waiting for us inside.

36:28.795 --> 36:30.449
Your mother and brother.

36:30.492 --> 36:32.755
We could dismember them together.

36:32.799 --> 36:35.410
Why on earth would I do that?

36:35.454 --> 36:38.544
Because we are soulmates.

36:38.587 --> 36:39.893
You are...

36:41.111 --> 36:43.070
deranged.

36:43.113 --> 36:46.116
Put on that mask
and you'll see.

36:49.598 --> 36:52.949
As if putting on a mask
makes you a killer.

36:52.993 --> 36:57.737
<i>♪ A girl before</i>

36:59.347 --> 37:00.653

37:06.702 --> 37:08.138
I'm nothing like you.

37:17.974 --> 37:19.541
Baby, what... What happened?

37:19.585 --> 37:21.021
I heard a gunshot.

37:21.064 --> 37:22.022
Yeah.

37:24.024 --> 37:25.286
TBK's dead.

37:26.113 --> 37:27.332
Are you sure?

37:28.463 --> 37:29.421
Yeah.

37:41.128 --> 37:42.172
Is it really over?

37:43.391 --> 37:44.479
I hope so.

37:53.183 --> 37:54.620
Your nephew and Miss Tate

37:54.663 --> 37:57.579
are proving to be
formidable adversaries.

37:57.623 --> 37:59.581
And now that the workers
have established tethers,

37:59.625 --> 38:02.323
it'll be difficult to reassert
control over their minds.

38:02.367 --> 38:04.194
You want me
to call in some guys?

38:04.238 --> 38:06.066
To show some old-school
union busting

38:06.109 --> 38:08.373
like they did back in Matewan
and Harlan County?

38:08.416 --> 38:10.592
No, Frank.

38:10.636 --> 38:13.116
I want to go even more
old-school than that.

38:14.204 --> 38:15.510
If the citizens of Riverdale

38:15.554 --> 38:17.251
wish to stand
united against me,

38:17.295 --> 38:19.427
then the price they'll pay
for their defiance

38:19.471 --> 38:22.735
will be truly biblical.

38:22.778 --> 38:24.519
<i>And then</i> <i>
what happened?</i>

38:24.563 --> 38:25.781
And then, I shot him.

38:27.653 --> 38:28.654

38:31.352 --> 38:35.095
The same gun my dad used
to shoot your dad.

38:35.138 --> 38:38.185
I think everything that
I've been feeling lately

38:38.228 --> 38:40.883
distills down to this.

38:40.927 --> 38:44.234
I fear that whatever
was inside my dad,

38:45.714 --> 38:48.326
whatever drove him
to hurt people,

38:50.284 --> 38:51.633
including your dad...

38:54.941 --> 38:56.725
that it's inside me, too.

38:58.423 --> 39:02.122
I'm afraid that one day
I might not be able to...

39:03.515 --> 39:05.386
resist it.

39:09.695 --> 39:12.785
And that you'll be a victim
to that darkness.

39:13.786 --> 39:15.744
Or, at least fearful of it.

39:17.616 --> 39:20.488
I'm afraid that you'll look
at me one day and...

39:22.447 --> 39:26.102
decide you won't wanna
be with me because of who I am.

39:26.146 --> 39:29.367
Who I've always been.

39:29.410 --> 39:30.933
That's not gonna happen, Betty.

39:31.978 --> 39:33.849
Well, you don't know that.

39:34.415 --> 39:35.242
But I do.

39:36.722 --> 39:38.724
You may not
trust yourself, Betty.

39:40.334 --> 39:41.335
But I trust you.

39:42.815 --> 39:43.816
With my life.

39:47.167 --> 39:48.473
Your dad didn't
make you a killer.

39:48.516 --> 39:50.388
TBK didn't make you a killer.

39:51.998 --> 39:53.129
Didn't they?

39:55.218 --> 39:56.394
Do you remember that time...

39:57.569 --> 39:59.353
we found that baby bird?

39:59.397 --> 40:03.488
It had fallen from a tree
and I had no clue what to do.

40:03.531 --> 40:06.142
And you ran into the house,
grabbed a shoebox,

40:07.405 --> 40:09.755
made a nest out of newspaper?

40:11.931 --> 40:13.498
We looked after him.

40:13.541 --> 40:16.022
We took turns until he was
strong enough to fly.

40:25.814 --> 40:28.817
I hadn't remembered that
until now.

40:28.861 --> 40:30.602
All you see is the darkness.

40:32.038 --> 40:34.780
All I see is someone who,
despite everything

40:34.823 --> 40:35.781
that's happened to her...

40:36.912 --> 40:37.957
fought.

40:39.349 --> 40:40.612
And you're still fighting.

40:42.048 --> 40:43.484
And the fact that
you're even worried

40:43.528 --> 40:45.660
about hurting me
or anyone else,

40:45.704 --> 40:47.357
that shows
what's in your heart.

40:50.926 --> 40:51.927
Do you believe that?

40:54.103 --> 40:55.322
Do you believe me?

40:55.365 --> 40:56.497
I think I do.

40:58.020 --> 41:00.414
I love you, Betty.

41:02.547 --> 41:04.549
I love you too, Archie.
