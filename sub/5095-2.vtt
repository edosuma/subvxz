WEBVTT

00:07.197 --> 00:09.599
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate you working

00:09.601 --> 00:11.834
for our Widows' and Kids'
Fund-raiser, Boomer.

00:11.836 --> 00:13.202
Well, you know, that's
my pleasure, Frank.

00:13.204 --> 00:14.336
Any time.

00:14.338 --> 00:17.373
Well, our ticket sales are
way up over last year,

00:17.375 --> 00:21.342
and I have a hunch that has
to do with you and the NFL.

00:21.344 --> 00:23.244
Well, it's
my honor.

00:23.246 --> 00:26.481
So, if there's anything
I can do for you in return...

00:28.084 --> 00:29.685
How about a, uh,
parking sticker

00:29.687 --> 00:32.054
that I could put on my car
so I can park in front of the Garden

00:32.055 --> 00:34.122
when the Knicks and
Rangers are playing?

00:35.391 --> 00:37.357
Anything within
reason, Boomer.

00:37.359 --> 00:39.326
Well, I tried.
You can't blame me for that.

00:39.328 --> 00:40.527
Thank you.
Thanks, Frank.

00:40.529 --> 00:41.428
Great to see you.

00:41.430 --> 00:43.497
Take care.
- Okay.

00:45.467 --> 00:47.034
You missed Boomer.

00:47.036 --> 00:49.904
I'm more of
a Phil Simms guy.

00:49.906 --> 00:50.906
We have a situation.

00:50.907 --> 00:52.406
A Brooklyn South
homicide detective

00:52.408 --> 00:54.273
just got shot at
the South Street Seaport.

00:54.275 --> 00:55.275
How bad?

00:55.276 --> 00:57.343
Not bad.
Took one in the leg.

00:57.345 --> 00:58.511
We catch
the shooter?

00:58.513 --> 00:59.713
Immediately.

00:59.715 --> 01:01.180
So what's
the situation?

01:01.182 --> 01:04.918
Well, the shooter is the
detective's own partner,

01:04.920 --> 01:06.252
Chris Scanlon.

01:10.056 --> 01:11.323
(sighs)

01:11.325 --> 01:12.658
Tell me it was
an accident.

01:12.660 --> 01:14.893
The jury is still out,
Frank.

01:21.367 --> 01:23.936
(siren wailing)

01:23.938 --> 01:26.404
I'm just saying you
could've cut the guy loose.

01:26.406 --> 01:28.139
We caught him
red-handed

01:28.141 --> 01:29.641
ripping off
a bodega.

01:29.643 --> 01:31.042
You really think he
should get collared

01:31.044 --> 01:32.476
for stealing a lousy
loaf of bread?

01:32.478 --> 01:34.278
We don't make the law,
Eddie, we just enforce it.

01:34.280 --> 01:35.613
Well...

01:35.615 --> 01:37.115
Hey.

01:37.117 --> 01:38.349
What...?

01:38.351 --> 01:40.785
JANKO: I thought she got
transferred out of here.

01:40.787 --> 01:42.754
I guess things didn't
work out back at the 2-7.

01:42.756 --> 01:46.189
OFFICER: You shouldn't have come
back here, Walsh.

01:46.191 --> 01:47.991
Guess they don't like rats
over there, either.

01:47.993 --> 01:49.660
Kara was subpoenaed
by the grand jury.

01:49.662 --> 01:51.028
She did what
she had to do.

01:51.030 --> 01:52.595
She hung her partner out to dry.

01:52.597 --> 01:55.165
Her partner killed
a suspect in custody.

01:55.167 --> 01:56.299
It was self-defense.

01:56.301 --> 01:58.201
Even the grand jury
refused to indict him.

01:58.203 --> 01:59.936
And now a good
cop's out of a job,

01:59.938 --> 02:01.904
while the one that put him there

02:01.906 --> 02:03.739
is still on
the street.

02:03.741 --> 02:05.374
Hey, Kara.

02:05.376 --> 02:07.576
Hey.

02:08.812 --> 02:10.812
Sure I'm the last person you
expected to see back here.

02:10.815 --> 02:12.314
You taking your
partner's old locker?

02:12.316 --> 02:13.582
I hear that's
available.

02:13.584 --> 02:14.616
Eddie.

02:14.618 --> 02:15.651
It's okay.

02:15.653 --> 02:16.852
Been getting stuff
like that all day.

02:16.854 --> 02:19.287
Well, you got a
stand-up cop canned.

02:19.289 --> 02:21.690
Were you expecting a
welcome home party?

02:24.626 --> 02:26.627
I'll see you
outside.

02:29.732 --> 02:31.766
Eddie flies off
the handle.

02:31.768 --> 02:32.967
She probably
didn't mean to.

02:32.969 --> 02:34.768
I'm pretty sure she did.

02:36.171 --> 02:38.338
I'll catch you later.

02:42.210 --> 02:43.677
(Baez sighs)

02:43.679 --> 02:46.213
BAEZ:
23 is too young to die.

02:46.215 --> 02:48.916
Especially when eight of those
23 years are spent suffering.

02:48.918 --> 02:51.018
BAEZ:
What happened?

02:51.020 --> 02:53.920
One of those cases
you never forget.

02:53.922 --> 02:55.254
Isabel was 15,

02:55.256 --> 02:56.789
just trying to make it
home from high school.

02:56.791 --> 02:58.791
She walked right into the middle
of a gang hit.

02:58.793 --> 03:00.526
Did you catch the shooter?

03:00.528 --> 03:01.493
Yeah.

03:01.495 --> 03:04.330
15-year-old punk.
Damon Williams.

03:04.332 --> 03:05.765
He was tried as a juvenile,

03:05.767 --> 03:07.499
served three years
for assault only.

03:07.501 --> 03:08.701
Meanwhile,

03:08.703 --> 03:10.301
Isabel spends the rest
of her life

03:10.303 --> 03:12.337
in and out of hospitals,
suffering.

03:15.174 --> 03:17.709
Thanks for
coming, Danny.

03:17.711 --> 03:19.310
I'm sorry for your
loss, Marcus.

03:19.312 --> 03:21.279
Isabel was a
great girl.

03:21.281 --> 03:23.048
This is my partner,
Detective Baez.

03:23.050 --> 03:25.117
Marcus Greene.
My condolences.

03:25.119 --> 03:27.684
Your partner never forgot us.

03:28.686 --> 03:30.654
Just wish I could've done more.

03:32.157 --> 03:33.624
I'm still hoping you can.

03:33.626 --> 03:35.826
How so?

03:35.828 --> 03:38.562
The bastard who shot Isabel
is a free man...

03:38.564 --> 03:41.766
and my daughter is dead.

03:41.768 --> 03:42.999
DANNY:
I'm not

03:43.001 --> 03:45.235
quite sure what
you're asking here, Marcus.

03:45.237 --> 03:48.304
Damon Williams killed my child.

03:48.306 --> 03:50.173
It took him
eight years,

03:50.175 --> 03:53.176
but he's still a damn murderer.

03:54.578 --> 03:55.845
He needs to pay.

03:55.847 --> 03:57.680
You understand
it's not that simple.

03:57.682 --> 03:59.882
It seems real simple to me.

04:01.084 --> 04:03.852
My little girl is gone

04:03.854 --> 04:06.554
and I want justice.

Kara sold out her partner.

She deserves what

04:48.060 --> 04:50.110
You want to let a
shoplifter off Scot-free,

but you've got zero

It's not always

05:04.293 --> 05:05.492
It is that simple to me.

05:05.494 --> 05:07.244
The second you
start worrying

05:07.246 --> 05:09.746
if your partner's
gonna back you up,

05:09.748 --> 05:11.965
then you're not 100% focused
on the job.

05:11.967 --> 05:13.300
That's when bad stuff happens.
Okay.

05:13.302 --> 05:15.585
So let's say it was
you and me that day.

05:15.587 --> 05:18.004
Suspect resists,
I choke the guy to death

05:18.006 --> 05:19.890
right in front of you.
You're called in

05:19.892 --> 05:21.591
to testify-- under oath.
What do you do?

05:21.593 --> 05:23.343
If you're afraid for your life

05:23.345 --> 05:24.978
and you do what you have to do,

05:24.980 --> 05:26.596
I'm gonna cover
your ass, Reagan.

05:26.598 --> 05:27.564
That's what partners do.

05:27.566 --> 05:29.816
Yeah? Well, if you
ever cross the line

05:29.818 --> 05:31.318
and somebody
winds up dead...

05:31.320 --> 05:32.936
I'm telling you right now:
I won't cover for you.

05:32.938 --> 05:35.238
You know, you pretend
to be a Boy Scout.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.524
Push comes to shove,
you'd do the right thing.

05:37.526 --> 05:39.276
Yeah, I would.

05:39.278 --> 05:40.777
And you'd be on your own.

05:41.997 --> 05:44.164
(scoffs)

05:46.585 --> 05:49.169
We're talking about witnesses
who may have disappeared,

05:49.171 --> 05:50.837
the recollections
that may have changed,

05:50.839 --> 05:52.422
evidence that may
have been destroyed.

05:52.424 --> 05:53.624
So you're saying
there's no way

05:53.625 --> 05:55.008
to make this
Damon Williams guy

05:55.010 --> 05:57.210
pay for this
girl's death?

05:58.630 --> 06:00.514
The delayed death exception

06:00.516 --> 06:03.300
allows for prosecution
in cases like this.

06:03.302 --> 06:04.768
So there's
a chance.

06:04.770 --> 06:05.886
A slim one.

06:05.888 --> 06:07.604
Okay, will you at least
take a look at the file?

06:07.606 --> 06:08.606
Will I ever

06:08.607 --> 06:10.440
hear the end of it
if I don't?

06:10.442 --> 06:12.726
You are the best.

06:12.728 --> 06:13.860
I'm not making
any promises.

06:13.862 --> 06:14.945
I owe you one.

06:14.947 --> 06:16.730
Yeah, I'll put
it on your tab.

06:16.732 --> 06:18.532
Donnie Alvarado
sends his regards.

06:18.534 --> 06:19.616
What's he up to?

06:19.618 --> 06:21.568
Retired last year.
Mmm.

06:21.570 --> 06:22.986
Married a girl
half his age,

06:22.988 --> 06:24.905
bought a place
up in Brewster.

06:24.907 --> 06:26.706
Wasn't his last wife
half his age?

06:26.708 --> 06:28.074
Yeah, but she
got older.

06:28.076 --> 06:29.826
(chuckles)
Okay.

06:29.828 --> 06:31.495
Regards
back to him.

06:31.497 --> 06:33.046
Makes me the
last active member

06:33.048 --> 06:35.499
of our old squad
at the 2-1.

06:35.501 --> 06:36.716
Last and best.

06:36.718 --> 06:38.335
Yeah, if I'd been half
the cop you were...

06:38.337 --> 06:39.753
Yeah, well, that
medal of honor

06:39.755 --> 06:41.171
you earned says
otherwise.

06:41.173 --> 06:42.088
Thank you.

06:42.090 --> 06:43.340
You ever go
by the marina,

06:43.342 --> 06:45.008
see if our old fishing
boat's still there?

06:45.010 --> 06:46.843
Well, not since we sold it.
Mmm.

06:46.845 --> 06:48.678
Had some good times on that boat.
FRANK: Yeah.

06:48.680 --> 06:50.397
Be fun to see
who has her now.

06:50.399 --> 06:52.149
(chuckles)

06:52.151 --> 06:53.350
No calls.

06:53.352 --> 06:55.519
Yes, sir.

06:55.521 --> 06:57.354
You want some coffee?

06:57.356 --> 06:58.822
I'm good.

07:00.742 --> 07:04.277
My union rep advised me
not to come down here,

07:04.279 --> 07:07.030
but I told him you
and I got history.

07:07.032 --> 07:09.249
And we do.
Yeah.

07:10.118 --> 07:11.952
So what happened
at Seaport?

07:13.455 --> 07:15.672
Detective Clark and I
were chasing down a lead

07:15.674 --> 07:18.258
on a homicide
in Flatbush.

07:18.260 --> 07:20.927
Grabbed a bite,
and on the way out

07:20.929 --> 07:23.547
Jimmy noticed I was
carrying my old revolver.

07:23.549 --> 07:26.216
He'd never seen
one like it.

07:26.218 --> 07:28.301
I go to hand it to him,
and somehow

07:28.303 --> 07:30.437
one of us catches the trigger

07:30.439 --> 07:32.022
and the damn thing goes off.

07:34.810 --> 07:36.576
I'm sorry as hell, Frank.

07:36.578 --> 07:38.612
I know this puts you
in a tough spot.

07:38.614 --> 07:40.730
Cop shoots another cop, Chris,

07:40.732 --> 07:43.149
it puts the whole damn
department in a tough spot.

07:43.151 --> 07:44.484
I understand.

07:44.486 --> 07:47.320
But it was an
accidental discharge.

07:47.322 --> 07:48.538
It happens.

07:48.540 --> 07:49.956
It shouldn't happen.

07:51.543 --> 07:54.327
So...

07:54.329 --> 07:56.746
this lead on the
homicide in Flatbush

07:56.748 --> 07:57.998
was at Seaport?

07:58.000 --> 08:00.717
No, we just took
our meal there.

08:00.719 --> 08:02.419
Seaport's a tourist mecca.

08:02.421 --> 08:04.804
It's not exactly
an on-the-way lunch spot.

08:04.806 --> 08:06.806
We wanted seafood.

08:06.808 --> 08:09.009
(laughs)

08:10.512 --> 08:12.679
(laughs)

08:14.066 --> 08:17.100
Look, I appreciate
you coming down.

08:20.188 --> 08:21.938
The thing is...

08:21.940 --> 08:24.107
I'm four months from retirement

08:24.109 --> 08:25.942
and a full pension.

08:25.944 --> 08:28.078
Jason's in dental school,

08:28.080 --> 08:29.613
Jennifer's
at Hunter...

08:29.615 --> 08:33.198
I can't interfere with
an investigation, Chris.

08:34.169 --> 08:37.504
I just want to
retire with honor

08:37.506 --> 08:40.006
from the job
I love.

08:49.351 --> 08:50.767
Hey.

08:50.769 --> 08:53.019
ERIN: Detective! You
got a minute for me?

08:53.021 --> 08:55.055
What's up?

08:55.057 --> 08:56.723
I reviewed the case file
on the shooting

08:56.725 --> 08:58.391
of Isabel Greene in 2006.

08:58.393 --> 09:00.510
And...?
And the assistant

09:00.512 --> 09:01.978
corporation counsel
was well within

09:01.980 --> 09:03.280
its sentencing
guidelines

09:03.282 --> 09:05.231
on Damon Williams,
despite the strenuous

09:05.233 --> 09:07.617
objections of the
arresting detective.

09:07.619 --> 09:09.703
This guy's got
a record a mile long.

09:09.705 --> 09:12.405
Her injuries were not deemed
life-threatening at the time.

09:12.407 --> 09:14.374
Well, whoever did
the "deeming" is wrong.

09:14.376 --> 09:16.826
Which brings us to
the cause of death.

09:16.828 --> 09:19.262
I ordered a review
of her medical history

09:19.264 --> 09:21.047
and of the
autopsy results.

09:21.049 --> 09:23.833
The M.E. found that
Isabel Greene died

09:23.835 --> 09:25.502
from complications
caused by

09:25.504 --> 09:27.387
the bullet from
Damon Williams' gun.

09:27.389 --> 09:28.838
So what are
you saying?

09:28.840 --> 09:31.424
Find Damon Williams and bring
him in for questioning.

09:31.426 --> 09:33.226
I take back
every mean thing

09:33.228 --> 09:34.678
I ever said about you.

09:34.680 --> 09:36.062
It doesn't mean we're
gonna charge him.

09:36.064 --> 09:37.480
It's still very
difficult to prove.

09:37.482 --> 09:39.265
And you're gonna
prove it, sis.

09:39.267 --> 09:40.350
Dan...
That's why

09:40.352 --> 09:41.985
you get the big bucks.
Right?

09:41.987 --> 09:44.688
I know you
can prove it.

09:51.496 --> 09:53.580
Ooh.
Seriously, Pop?

09:53.582 --> 09:56.700
Whoa, you're not sending my
lucky shirt to Goodwill.

09:56.702 --> 09:58.251
The only thing lucky
about that shirt

09:58.253 --> 09:59.703
is that Grandma
never saw you in it.

09:59.705 --> 10:00.670
Ha-ha.

10:00.672 --> 10:01.855
FRANK:
Hello?

10:01.857 --> 10:03.957
Hey.
Hey.

10:03.959 --> 10:05.008
Hey.

10:05.010 --> 10:06.343
Sorry I'm late.

10:06.345 --> 10:08.128
Thanks for coming out.

10:08.130 --> 10:10.180
No problem.
What's up?

10:10.182 --> 10:12.132
(sighs)

10:16.521 --> 10:18.471
How are things going

10:18.473 --> 10:20.690
for Kara Walsh
down at your house?

10:20.692 --> 10:23.109
She's catching a raw deal.

10:23.111 --> 10:25.695
She deserves it.

10:25.697 --> 10:26.946
She stepped up
and told the truth.

10:26.948 --> 10:28.198
You know how I feel about

10:28.200 --> 10:29.532
cops going against other cops.

10:29.534 --> 10:31.534
She did her duty, Pop.

10:31.536 --> 10:33.203
And she's catching hell for it.

10:33.205 --> 10:34.654
(sighs)

10:34.656 --> 10:36.239
That should be me,
catching hell.

10:36.241 --> 10:37.991
Why you?

10:37.993 --> 10:40.460
(sighs deeply)

10:40.462 --> 10:42.379
Not to leave this room.

10:43.832 --> 10:45.665
Okay.

10:47.919 --> 10:51.721
I talked her into testifying
before that grand jury.

10:51.723 --> 10:53.423
But her
testimony

10:53.425 --> 10:56.393
had nothing to do with
her partner's termination.

10:56.395 --> 10:58.645
The grand jury ruled
in his favor.

10:59.681 --> 11:01.347
I fired him.

11:02.768 --> 11:04.234
Why?

11:04.236 --> 11:07.904
Because I could.

11:07.906 --> 11:11.241
Because I think I know
better than any grand jury

11:11.243 --> 11:14.277
what kind of cop
I want in my command.

11:14.279 --> 11:17.113
What do you do for Kara Walsh?

11:17.115 --> 11:19.532
Nothing I can do,

11:19.534 --> 11:22.118
except arrange
for another transfer,

11:22.120 --> 11:25.288
and that's just kicking
the same can down the same road.

11:26.958 --> 11:30.627
The question is...

11:30.629 --> 11:33.680
what can you do for her?

11:47.333 --> 11:49.967
Do you want coffee or tea?

11:49.969 --> 11:52.587
(sighs)

11:52.589 --> 11:55.223
I really shouldn't drink
on school nights.

11:55.225 --> 11:56.841
Well, you're the one
who kept ordering

11:56.843 --> 11:58.092
more champagne last night.

11:58.094 --> 11:59.844
Don't remind me.

11:59.846 --> 12:01.345
That stuff costs a fortune.

12:01.347 --> 12:03.264
It's a good thing your
practice has more than doubled

12:03.266 --> 12:04.515
in the last
six months.

12:04.517 --> 12:05.900
You can afford
it, Counselor.

12:05.902 --> 12:08.519
I guess I'm lucky I only get
to see you once a month.

12:08.521 --> 12:09.737
Mmm.

12:11.324 --> 12:13.574
Well, I have a teenage
daughter, Bobby--

12:13.576 --> 12:15.493
and the second I found
out she was going

12:15.495 --> 12:16.694
to Boston on
a school trip,

12:16.696 --> 12:17.945
you were my
first call.

12:17.947 --> 12:19.747
I'm flattered.

12:19.749 --> 12:21.866
So, do I ever get to meet
this alleged daughter?

12:21.868 --> 12:23.618
I am having enough trouble

12:23.620 --> 12:25.586
trying to control
her raging hormones

12:25.588 --> 12:27.204
without bringing home stray men.

12:27.206 --> 12:28.589
For the record,

12:28.591 --> 12:29.757
I've had all my shots.

12:29.759 --> 12:31.792
I'm nearly housebroken.

12:31.794 --> 12:34.879
I'm just looking for a hot
prosecutor to adopt me.

12:34.881 --> 12:37.048
Okay, okay.
Down, boy.

12:38.017 --> 12:39.884
My life is complicated
enough right now.

12:39.886 --> 12:43.554
The D.A. resigning in the wake
of that surveillance scandal.

12:43.556 --> 12:45.222
The rumor is--

12:45.224 --> 12:48.776
the governor's bringing in an
interim D.A. to clean house.

12:48.778 --> 12:51.062
A fresh set of eyes
can be helpful.

12:51.064 --> 12:53.981
A political hack with a law
degree he's never used,

12:53.983 --> 12:55.733
to fix an office
that isn't broken?

12:55.735 --> 12:57.401
Maybe they'll go with
a former prosecutor?

12:57.403 --> 12:59.403
Great. A malcontent washout

12:59.405 --> 13:00.955
who couldn't handle
the caseload.

13:00.957 --> 13:02.039
That's even worse.

13:02.041 --> 13:03.991
Some people leave
the D.A.'s office

13:03.993 --> 13:05.576
for perfectly valid reasons.

13:05.578 --> 13:06.961
Like who?

13:06.963 --> 13:08.796
Like me.

13:08.798 --> 13:10.965
Like you.

13:12.085 --> 13:13.918
As in <i> you?</i>

13:13.920 --> 13:17.088
Got a call from the governor's
office two days ago.

13:18.257 --> 13:20.508
And if you say yes,
you'll be my boss?

13:20.510 --> 13:23.678
<i>Interim</i> boss.

13:24.681 --> 13:26.597
But I haven't made
a decision yet.

13:28.318 --> 13:31.936
Got to say, though,
it's tempting.

13:31.938 --> 13:34.855
Even for a malcontent washout
like me.

13:34.857 --> 13:38.776
Well, I guess
if you take the job,

13:38.778 --> 13:41.195
you'll save a lot on champagne.

13:41.197 --> 13:42.663
How's that?

13:42.665 --> 13:45.533
I've made it this far
without sleeping with my boss.

13:45.535 --> 13:48.536
I'm not about to start now.

13:55.261 --> 13:57.461
I've been jonesing
for a bacon cheeseburger

13:57.463 --> 13:58.629
ever since breakfast.

13:58.631 --> 14:00.881
You're a stroke waiting
to happen, Janko.

14:04.187 --> 14:06.470
Ugh.

14:07.974 --> 14:10.057
Don't even
think about it.

14:10.059 --> 14:11.809
What? Someone's got
to break the ice.

14:11.811 --> 14:12.860
Why?

14:12.862 --> 14:14.028
You coming?

14:14.030 --> 14:17.148
No. I'm getting
a bacon cheeseburger.

14:20.787 --> 14:23.237
MAN:
Look at this.

14:24.707 --> 14:26.490
Takes some guts to show up
in here. Good for you.

14:26.492 --> 14:29.994
I didn't do anything wrong.

14:29.996 --> 14:31.162
I'm not gonna hide.

14:31.164 --> 14:32.663
Mind if I sit?

14:32.665 --> 14:35.049
Thanks, Reagan,
but you don't have to do that.

14:35.051 --> 14:36.667
Come on, I chew
with my mouth shut.

14:38.054 --> 14:40.337
You don't want to get
in the middle of this.

14:41.591 --> 14:43.557
JAMIE:
How you holding up?

14:43.559 --> 14:46.177
No one will give me
the time of day,

14:46.179 --> 14:48.179
let alone partner up with me.

14:48.181 --> 14:50.765
Found a dead rat on the hood
of my car yesterday.

14:52.018 --> 14:53.818
Guess you can say
I've had better weeks.

14:53.820 --> 14:56.187
Well, for what it's worth,
I admire what you did.

14:56.189 --> 14:57.338
I think it took guts.

14:57.340 --> 15:00.858
Randy Cutter was
a great partner.

15:00.860 --> 15:01.992
My best friend.

15:01.994 --> 15:03.861
I would've taken
a bullet for him.

15:03.863 --> 15:05.112
Almost did a few times.

15:05.114 --> 15:06.363
Randy messed up.

15:06.365 --> 15:08.082
You did what you had to do.

15:08.084 --> 15:11.085
I'd do it again.

15:11.087 --> 15:14.121
Thing is...

15:14.123 --> 15:17.541
I've dreamed of being a cop
my whole life.

15:17.543 --> 15:18.709
And I always thought,

15:18.711 --> 15:23.097
if I did things the right way,
I'd be okay.

15:23.099 --> 15:25.433
Guess I was wrong.

15:38.731 --> 15:40.064
You sure
that's the guy?

15:40.066 --> 15:41.315
That's him, a little older.

15:41.317 --> 15:42.950
Damon Williams.

15:42.952 --> 15:44.201
Remember me?

15:44.203 --> 15:45.920
Detective Reagan.

15:45.922 --> 15:47.071
I'm flattered.

15:47.073 --> 15:49.039
Looks like you're running
the block here, huh?

15:49.041 --> 15:51.041
Nah, it ain't
like that.

15:51.043 --> 15:52.460
Really?

15:52.462 --> 15:55.830
Eight long years, you're back
out on the same crappy stoop,

15:55.832 --> 15:56.914
with the same
bunch of dirtbags.

15:56.916 --> 15:58.499
Hey, you're gonna want
to back up.

16:02.171 --> 16:04.588
Isabel Greene died
a few days ago.

16:04.590 --> 16:06.590
Yeah. I heard.

16:06.592 --> 16:08.175
Must've missed you
at the funeral.

16:08.177 --> 16:09.844
Look, I did my time for that.

16:09.846 --> 16:11.395
You got a slap
on the wrist for that.

16:11.397 --> 16:13.397
It was an accident,
I never meant to hurt nobody.

16:13.399 --> 16:14.598
DANNY: So, then,
you won't mind coming down,

16:14.600 --> 16:16.684
answering some questions
with us then.

16:16.686 --> 16:18.068
You arresting me?

16:18.070 --> 16:19.570
Give me a reason?

16:20.823 --> 16:23.107
I suggest you come with us.

16:27.330 --> 16:29.530
All right.

16:31.284 --> 16:32.500
Sit down.

16:32.502 --> 16:34.201
JANKO:
Hey, Jamie.

16:34.203 --> 16:36.287
The roll call is
all screwed up.

16:36.289 --> 16:38.372
Boss has me riding
with Righetti?

16:38.374 --> 16:40.925
Yeah, it's only
for a few days.

16:40.927 --> 16:43.010
Wait, uh, you knew
about this?

16:43.012 --> 16:44.795
Yeah, I requested it.

16:44.797 --> 16:46.430
Was it something
I said?

16:46.432 --> 16:48.132
No, it's nothing
like that, Janko.

16:48.134 --> 16:51.101
I'm just gonna ride with Kara
Walsh till the rest of the week.

16:51.103 --> 16:52.770
What?!

16:52.772 --> 16:54.221
Don't get all bent
out of shape.

16:54.223 --> 16:56.357
Well, did you at least even
consider talking to me

16:56.359 --> 16:57.808
about this before you pulled
the trigger?

16:57.810 --> 16:59.610
No, I didn't want
to have a big fight.

16:59.612 --> 17:01.111
Well, a little
late for that.

17:01.113 --> 17:03.314
Why the hell are
you doing this?

17:03.316 --> 17:05.148
Look, Kara's a good cop,
all right?

17:05.151 --> 17:08.569
Somebody's got to cross
the line and work with her.

17:08.570 --> 17:10.788
Hmm. You looked pretty
chummy at lunch.

17:10.790 --> 17:12.239
You got a thing for her?

17:12.241 --> 17:14.575
Yeah, I got a thing for a fellow
cop who's getting a raw deal.

17:14.577 --> 17:17.578
You need to think
about this, Jamie.

17:17.579 --> 17:19.213
Nobody trusts Walsh.

17:19.214 --> 17:21.714
So, if you ride with her,
no one's gonna trust you.

17:21.717 --> 17:22.665
I'll take that chance.

17:22.667 --> 17:23.917
Yeah? Well,
what about us?

17:23.920 --> 17:26.587
When we're riding
together again next week.

17:26.589 --> 17:28.055
You're gonna bring
that stink with you.

17:28.057 --> 17:30.507
Is that what you're worried
about-- your reputation?

17:30.509 --> 17:32.593
(scoffs)
Yeah.

17:32.595 --> 17:33.894
Yeah, and you know what?

17:33.896 --> 17:36.313
If you were smart you'd
be worried about it, too.

17:36.315 --> 17:38.349
You're making a big mistake.

17:39.602 --> 17:42.186
Ready to roll?

17:42.188 --> 17:45.155
Yeah, let's hit it.

17:45.157 --> 17:47.775
(sighs)

17:47.777 --> 17:49.577
Got news for me?

17:51.447 --> 17:52.863
I've asked you not to do that.

17:52.865 --> 17:53.881
I know.

17:53.883 --> 17:54.999
Got news for me?

17:55.001 --> 17:56.417
Yeah.

17:56.419 --> 17:57.585
You were right.

17:59.205 --> 18:01.555
I don't want to be right
about this.

18:01.557 --> 18:02.590
Okay, half-right.

18:02.592 --> 18:04.208
How?

18:04.210 --> 18:06.377
Detective Clark's blood alcohol
level was over the legal limit

18:06.379 --> 18:08.462
when he was admitted
with the gunshot wound.

18:10.967 --> 18:14.268
No word yet on your friend's
Breathalyzer.

18:14.270 --> 18:16.553
Because?

18:16.555 --> 18:18.439
Because either
he wasn't given one

18:18.441 --> 18:22.726
or my source hasn't been able
to get the results yet.

18:22.728 --> 18:25.779
Regulations mandate that an
officer be screened for alcohol

18:25.781 --> 18:28.616
after discharging his weapon
causing injury or death.

18:28.618 --> 18:30.200
Yes, they do.

18:30.202 --> 18:33.287
And tradition mandates

18:33.289 --> 18:36.874
that a decorated veteran cop be
given a break by his fellow cops

18:36.876 --> 18:40.477
in something like this, no?

18:43.399 --> 18:46.133
(sighs)

18:51.974 --> 18:53.924
I appreciate you
coming in, Damon.

18:53.926 --> 18:56.427
Detective didn't give
me much choice, so...

18:56.429 --> 19:00.064
That's because you may be facing
a manslaughter charge

19:00.066 --> 19:02.266
in the death of Isabel Greene.

19:05.855 --> 19:07.821
I feel terrible.

19:07.823 --> 19:10.024
About Isabel dying.

19:12.111 --> 19:13.827
What happened was an accident,

19:13.829 --> 19:15.245
but it was my fault.

19:15.247 --> 19:18.182
And I live with
that every day.

19:18.184 --> 19:20.167
But I've changed since then.

19:20.169 --> 19:21.585
I'm a different person now.

19:21.587 --> 19:23.120
I understand the detectives
picked you up

19:23.122 --> 19:25.122
in the same neighborhood
where you shot Isabel Greene

19:25.124 --> 19:26.707
eight years ago,

19:26.709 --> 19:28.375
in the company
of known gang members.

19:28.377 --> 19:30.461
It's not what it looks like.

19:30.463 --> 19:33.297
I'm the director for the
Garfield Community Center.

19:33.299 --> 19:35.799
We run basketball and soccer
leagues for at-risk youth.

19:35.801 --> 19:37.851
I was out
there trying

19:37.853 --> 19:40.721
to sign up them kids
when the detective found me.

19:40.723 --> 19:43.140
And if I call the Center,
they'll confirm your employment?

19:43.142 --> 19:45.359
Yeah.

19:45.361 --> 19:49.480
We... we've had a big impact
in that area.

19:49.482 --> 19:52.649
Even got a commendation
from the NYPD Anti-Gang Unit.

19:52.651 --> 19:54.368
That's admirable.

19:54.370 --> 19:55.619
But the fact remains,

19:55.621 --> 19:58.455
you did confess to shooting
Isabel Greene in 2006,

19:58.457 --> 20:02.209
and her death is directly linked
to the injuries you caused.

20:04.413 --> 20:09.233
There's no excuse
for what I did.

20:09.235 --> 20:10.834
But I was messed up back then.

20:10.836 --> 20:14.054
Drinking and
doing drugs.

20:14.056 --> 20:15.689
When I wound up in juvie,

20:15.691 --> 20:18.475
I knew that I had to turn
my life around.

20:18.477 --> 20:20.978
So, I got my high school diploma
when I was inside.

20:20.980 --> 20:24.014
And then I went
to Queens College.

20:24.016 --> 20:27.901
And now I'm trying
to give back to these kids.

20:27.903 --> 20:29.436
Trying to make sure

20:29.438 --> 20:33.323
that they don't make
the same mistakes that I made.

20:33.325 --> 20:34.775
So that...

20:37.029 --> 20:42.032
So that other people won't have
to suffer the way Isabel did.

20:50.543 --> 20:52.426
WALSH: I really appreciate
what you're doing, Jamie.

20:52.428 --> 20:53.877
Hey, forget it, Kara.

20:53.879 --> 20:56.130
I mean, I don't know if
it's gonna make any difference,

20:56.132 --> 20:58.966
but it's nice to ride
with a partner again.

20:58.968 --> 21:01.051
We'll see how you feel
by the end of tour.

21:01.053 --> 21:03.437
(laughs) Hope you're not
in too much trouble with Eddie.

21:03.439 --> 21:04.638
No, no. She'll
get over it.

21:04.640 --> 21:07.224
And what do
we have here?

21:08.110 --> 21:09.059
Hey, what's going on, Reynolds?

21:09.061 --> 21:10.144
You tell me, Reagan.

21:10.146 --> 21:11.395
You're the one riding
with the enemy.

21:11.397 --> 21:12.863
Screw you.

21:12.865 --> 21:14.531
I don't screw fellow cops;
that's your department.

21:14.533 --> 21:16.900
Hey, why don't you
give it a rest, huh?

21:16.902 --> 21:18.952
'Cause Randy Cutter was
my first partner.

21:18.954 --> 21:21.872
He was a great cop until
she stuck a knife in his back.

21:21.874 --> 21:25.025
Why don't you guys
take off, huh?

21:25.027 --> 21:26.293
Before we have a problem.

21:26.295 --> 21:29.012
You're the one
with the problem, Reagan.

21:29.014 --> 21:31.081
You should watch
the company you keep.

21:34.553 --> 21:36.587
Guy's always
been a jerk.

21:37.423 --> 21:39.506
Maybe.

21:39.508 --> 21:42.259
But everyone in the house
agrees with him.

21:42.261 --> 21:45.345
Doesn't mean
they're right.

21:45.347 --> 21:48.015
DISPATCH: 12-David. You have
a 10-31, commercial burglary,

21:48.017 --> 21:49.900
714 30th at Commerce.

21:49.902 --> 21:51.735
12-David.
Show us responding.

21:51.737 --> 21:53.270
(siren wailing,
tires screeching)

21:58.410 --> 22:01.111
(alarm sounding)

22:13.792 --> 22:15.375
(indistinct chatter)

22:23.969 --> 22:25.853
Police! Don't move!
Keep your hands

22:25.855 --> 22:27.020
where I can see them!

22:27.022 --> 22:28.388
Cops! Cops!
(gunfire)

22:28.390 --> 22:29.806
There's three of them!

22:30.392 --> 22:32.392
(shouting)

22:34.146 --> 22:36.313
Back, back that way.

22:43.322 --> 22:45.155
12-David. We got shots fired
at this location!

22:45.157 --> 22:46.907
10-13 at this location!

22:46.909 --> 22:48.909
10-13!

22:51.330 --> 22:52.829
Where the hell's our backup?

22:52.831 --> 22:53.997
We're on our own, Jamie!

22:53.999 --> 22:55.215
And we're sitting ducks!

22:55.217 --> 22:56.500
We got to make a move!

22:56.502 --> 22:58.669
(siren wailing)

23:01.674 --> 23:04.508
Hey, you go around back.

23:07.563 --> 23:09.429
Police!

23:09.431 --> 23:11.348
Don't move!
(gunshots)

23:13.736 --> 23:15.319
Eddie!

23:15.321 --> 23:16.653
Hey, Eddie,
come here.

23:16.655 --> 23:17.738
Stay low.

23:17.740 --> 23:18.572
You okay?

23:18.574 --> 23:19.606
Yeah.

23:19.608 --> 23:20.657
We got two more perps.

23:20.659 --> 23:22.359
Heavy weapons.

23:22.361 --> 23:23.744
I'm going after the guy
in the pharmacy.

23:23.746 --> 23:25.829
You guys push forward
and move left, okay?

23:25.831 --> 23:26.697
On three.

23:26.699 --> 23:29.783
One, two... three.

23:40.930 --> 23:42.179
Give it up!

23:42.181 --> 23:44.214
You're not getting out of here!

23:54.727 --> 23:55.943
WALSH:
Eddie, look out!

24:00.482 --> 24:01.898
(grunting)

24:05.487 --> 24:07.788
(grunts)

24:07.790 --> 24:09.072
I'm coming, Reagan!

24:09.074 --> 24:09.906
Righetti, cuff him up.

24:09.908 --> 24:11.241
I got him.
Get off me.

24:11.243 --> 24:13.327
RIGHETTI: Put your hands
behind your back.

24:14.713 --> 24:15.713
Officer hit!

24:15.714 --> 24:17.714
We need a bus forthwith!

24:17.716 --> 24:18.749
Are you okay?

24:18.751 --> 24:20.500
Yeah, I just got one
in the shoulder.

24:20.502 --> 24:22.085
Hey, where'd you come from?

24:22.087 --> 24:23.470
We were on the other side
of the precinct,

24:23.472 --> 24:25.305
and we heard your 13
come over the air.

24:26.308 --> 24:27.808
Where the hell is everyone else?

24:27.810 --> 24:30.927
We're wondering
the same thing.

24:41.274 --> 24:43.207
Please tell me you're not making

24:43.209 --> 24:45.293
your infamous
veggie lasagna again.

24:45.295 --> 24:47.828
Don't worry, after all that
whining, I went full carnivore.

24:47.830 --> 24:50.247
This ham should take three
years off your life.

24:50.249 --> 24:51.549
That's my girl.

24:51.551 --> 24:53.668
Oh, and by the way,

24:53.670 --> 24:55.803
I know I'm not the type
to go in for all

24:55.805 --> 24:57.338
the touchy-feely stuff, but...

24:57.340 --> 24:58.472
It's just a ham.

24:58.474 --> 25:00.041
There's no need to get
choked up about it.

25:00.043 --> 25:02.009
I'm talking about the case,
wise guy.

25:02.011 --> 25:04.178
You went out of your way.

25:04.180 --> 25:05.180
I appreciate it.

25:05.181 --> 25:07.982
That means a lot, so thanks.

25:07.984 --> 25:11.018
I know, which is why
this is so difficult.

25:11.020 --> 25:12.603
What's difficult?

25:12.605 --> 25:15.072
I brought the case to
my acting bureau chief,

25:15.074 --> 25:17.191
and he does not think we
should charge Damon Williams

25:17.193 --> 25:19.160
in the death of Isabel Greene.

25:19.162 --> 25:21.412
Okay. Well, you set him
straight, right?

25:22.815 --> 25:24.115
Right?!

25:24.117 --> 25:25.833
I agree with him.

25:25.835 --> 25:27.368
If you agree with him,
what the hell was that

25:27.370 --> 25:29.120
all about coming down
to my precinct?!

25:29.122 --> 25:30.755
I mean, you even said yourself

25:30.757 --> 25:32.540
the M.E.'s report confirmed
that it was the bullet

25:32.542 --> 25:34.542
that Williams put
into Isabel that killed her!

25:34.544 --> 25:38.129
Given the passage of time,
the defense would aggressively

25:38.131 --> 25:40.047
dispute that finding
and it would come down

25:40.049 --> 25:41.882
to our medical experts
against theirs.

25:41.884 --> 25:43.601
Okay. Well, what about
the delayed death thing?

25:43.603 --> 25:45.019
I mean, this is perfect

25:45.021 --> 25:46.804
for a bastard
like Damon Williams.

25:46.806 --> 25:48.723
Which is why I had
you bring him down.

25:48.725 --> 25:50.224
So I could gauge his demeanor.

25:50.226 --> 25:51.275
And the jury would find

25:51.277 --> 25:54.061
a smart, sympathetic
young man

25:54.063 --> 25:56.564
who paid for his crime
and changed his life.

25:56.566 --> 25:58.783
What? Changed his life how?

25:58.785 --> 26:00.067
Hmm? By starting

26:00.069 --> 26:01.402
a-a basketball league
for gangbangers?!

26:01.404 --> 26:02.703
Are you kidding me?!

26:02.705 --> 26:05.990
Danny, the D.A.'s office
has limited resources.

26:05.992 --> 26:08.409
We cannot try every case.

26:08.411 --> 26:10.378
Fine. I'll tell Marcus Greene

26:10.380 --> 26:12.129
that the system
can't be bothered

26:12.131 --> 26:14.882
finding justice
for his dead daughter!

26:14.884 --> 26:17.468
Danny...

26:17.470 --> 26:19.920
This ham's fantastic,
Aunt Erin.

26:19.922 --> 26:21.672
Absolutely.
Thanks.

26:21.674 --> 26:23.257
Yeah, it's delicious,
but you kind of sold out

26:23.259 --> 26:25.009
on the healthy stuff.

26:25.011 --> 26:27.094
Yeah, selling out's
her specialty.

26:28.414 --> 26:29.647
How's Officer Walsh?

26:29.649 --> 26:31.015
She's got a bunch of stitches
in her arm,

26:31.017 --> 26:32.516
but she got lucky.

26:32.518 --> 26:34.518
Seems like you all did.

26:34.520 --> 26:35.770
What happened
to backup, kid?

26:35.772 --> 26:36.987
They got delayed.

26:36.989 --> 26:38.989
What do you mean
they got delayed?

26:38.991 --> 26:40.524
Delayed how?

26:41.661 --> 26:44.111
Cement truck, uh, broke down.

26:44.113 --> 26:45.663
They had to clear
the sidewalk out

26:45.665 --> 26:46.947
back down the block that way.

26:46.949 --> 26:49.617
Took a while.

26:49.619 --> 26:52.620
HENRY: Dragging your feet
backing up a cheese eater

26:52.622 --> 26:54.255
used to happen all the time.

26:54.257 --> 26:55.623
I just said they weren't
dragging their feet.

26:55.625 --> 26:57.425
And Uncle Jamie's
not a cheese eater.

26:57.427 --> 26:59.210
And he almost got killed, too.

26:59.212 --> 27:00.461
Well, maybe you should've
never partnered up

27:00.463 --> 27:01.595
with her in the first place.

27:01.597 --> 27:03.431
Maybe he sees something
you don't.

27:03.433 --> 27:05.549
What's that supposed to mean?

27:05.551 --> 27:06.967
That if she's still on the job,

27:06.969 --> 27:09.520
it's because I think
she deserves to be.

27:09.522 --> 27:11.522
Which ought to
mean something

27:11.524 --> 27:13.524
at this table, if not out there.

27:14.977 --> 27:15.776
So, she's innocent.

27:15.778 --> 27:17.812
Yeah.
According to the jury

27:17.814 --> 27:19.029
on your right,
she's innocent.

27:19.031 --> 27:20.815
Well, I got faith in that jury.

27:20.817 --> 27:21.817
Thank you.

27:21.818 --> 27:24.652
What is eating you?

27:24.654 --> 27:26.737
Well, juries are not supposed

27:26.739 --> 27:28.289
to be comprised of only one.

27:28.291 --> 27:29.874
Isn't that right, sis?

27:29.876 --> 27:31.575
Give it a break, Danny.

27:31.577 --> 27:33.244
Am I missing something here?

27:33.246 --> 27:34.962
Danny's upset
because my office refused

27:34.964 --> 27:37.164
to charge one of his suspects.

27:37.166 --> 27:39.550
"Suspect"? The guy's
guilty and you know it.

27:39.552 --> 27:42.837
Damon Williams accidentally
shot someone eight years ago.

27:42.839 --> 27:44.839
He paid for it.

27:44.841 --> 27:47.391
And he changed his life.
He deserves a second chance.

27:47.393 --> 27:48.592
Accidentally, my foot.

27:48.594 --> 27:51.262
Once a skel, always a skel.

27:51.264 --> 27:53.013
Is that what you think, Dad?

27:53.015 --> 27:56.851
Once you're in the system,
you can't be rehabilitated?

27:56.853 --> 28:00.020
People have been debating that
since they built the first jail.

28:00.022 --> 28:03.357
If you're asking do I think
rehabilitation is possible,

28:03.359 --> 28:04.692
I think it is.

28:04.694 --> 28:05.743
Thank you.

28:05.745 --> 28:07.828
It is also,
in my experience,

28:07.830 --> 28:09.747
exceedingly rare.

28:09.749 --> 28:11.198
NICKY:
In civics, they taught us

28:11.200 --> 28:14.118
that the penal system is
supposed to punish and reform.

28:14.120 --> 28:15.870
HENRY:
Well, whoever wrote that

28:15.872 --> 28:18.255
never walked a beat
a day in their life.

28:18.257 --> 28:19.874
Lot of good people
spent time in prison.

28:19.876 --> 28:21.208
Martin Luther King...

28:21.210 --> 28:22.960
Nelson Mandela.
Thomas More.

28:22.962 --> 28:24.929
Paris Hilton.
JAMIE: What?

28:26.382 --> 28:28.465
What?

28:28.467 --> 28:30.217
JAMIE:
The system's built

28:30.219 --> 28:32.436
on the assumption that-- except
for the worst of the worst--

28:32.438 --> 28:34.555
people who mess up
eventually get a second chance.

28:34.557 --> 28:38.359
And the exception being
those who kill other people.

28:38.361 --> 28:40.444
Danny, it wasn't
an easy decision.

28:40.446 --> 28:42.229
Yeah, well, it was a lot tougher
for Marcus Greene.

28:42.231 --> 28:44.231
And I know 'cause
I'm the one that had to call him

28:44.233 --> 28:45.282
and give him the bad news

28:45.284 --> 28:48.485
and listen to him cry
on the telephone.

29:00.132 --> 29:02.333
(keys clink)

29:05.922 --> 29:07.922
Don't be too hard
on your brother.

29:07.924 --> 29:10.424
That's funny. I could've sworn
I was the injured party there.

29:10.426 --> 29:12.426
It's personal with him.

29:12.428 --> 29:13.928
Come on, it's always
personal for him.

29:13.930 --> 29:15.646
Doesn't give him
the right to use me

29:15.648 --> 29:17.765
as a punching bag every time
he doesn't get his way.

29:17.767 --> 29:20.601
No, it doesn't.

29:20.603 --> 29:22.436
You guys think it's easy for us

29:22.438 --> 29:24.939
to decide who gets charged
and who doesn't?

29:24.941 --> 29:27.241
It's not like we're sitting
around the D.A.'s office

29:27.243 --> 29:29.109
waiting for an opportunity
to play God.

29:29.111 --> 29:30.111
That's the job.

29:30.112 --> 29:33.280
Well, you got a hell
of a responsibility.

29:33.282 --> 29:37.751
And I feel terrible about
what happened to Isabel Greene,

29:37.753 --> 29:39.670
but the case against
Damon Williams

29:39.672 --> 29:41.622
was a long shot at best.

29:41.624 --> 29:44.675
And even if you managed
to put him away,

29:44.677 --> 29:47.378
you're not sure
it's the right thing to do.

29:48.230 --> 29:50.014
No.

29:51.851 --> 29:54.051
DANNY:
I got a call, Dad.

29:54.053 --> 29:56.637
I got to go.

29:56.639 --> 29:59.023
Actually, why don't you
take a ride with me, sis?

29:59.025 --> 30:00.524
What?

30:00.526 --> 30:02.142
This concerns both of us.

30:02.144 --> 30:03.611
Come on,
what is this about, Danny?

30:03.613 --> 30:05.362
You'll find out
when we get there.

30:19.662 --> 30:21.996
I don't know.

30:21.998 --> 30:23.130
(indistinct radio transmission)

30:23.132 --> 30:24.415
You want to tell me
what's going on?

30:24.417 --> 30:26.000
Oh, you just wait and see.

30:26.002 --> 30:27.167
What do we got?

30:27.169 --> 30:29.670
Male victim, gunshot
wound to the abdomen.

30:29.672 --> 30:31.088
There's our victim--

30:31.090 --> 30:33.007
Damon Williams.

30:33.009 --> 30:34.091
ERIN:
What happened?

30:34.093 --> 30:35.676
Apparently the victim
was working late.

30:35.678 --> 30:37.511
Shooter entered
through an open window.

30:37.513 --> 30:38.679
Where's our suspect?

30:38.681 --> 30:41.015
I got him over here,
in the back of the car.

30:41.017 --> 30:41.808
Come on.

30:41.831 --> 30:43.183
Arriving D.A. will be
here in a minute.

30:43.185 --> 30:46.687
I didn't bring you down here
for that, okay? Just come on.

30:48.441 --> 30:50.691
Say hello
to Marcus Greene.

30:50.693 --> 30:53.160
Isabel Greene's father.

30:54.697 --> 30:57.698
That son of a bitch got what
he had coming to him, Danny.

30:57.700 --> 30:59.833
He got what he had
coming to him.

31:02.505 --> 31:05.706
His daughter's dead,
and he's getting locked up.

31:05.708 --> 31:08.125
Hope you can live with yourself.

31:22.744 --> 31:24.096
JAMIE: <i>Boss wants to</i>
<i>put you in for a medal</i>

31:24.120 --> 31:26.052
for bailing us out.
- Yeah.

31:26.076 --> 31:29.189
I told him Walsh is the one
that should be decorated.

31:29.213 --> 31:32.184
That's a stand-up move, Janko.

31:37.160 --> 31:38.888
Jamie.

31:38.912 --> 31:40.466
I checked the roll call,
Reynolds.

31:41.294 --> 31:42.835
You and your partner
were the closest unit

31:42.859 --> 31:44.499
when we got pinned down
in that drugstore.

31:45.158 --> 31:47.074
Yeah, thing is,
we had some engine trouble.

31:47.098 --> 31:48.364
Couldn't get to you guys.

31:48.388 --> 31:50.028
Yeah? Because...

31:50.398 --> 31:53.322
you never called in a 62, taking
your vehicle out of service.

31:53.460 --> 31:54.359
It's fine now.

31:54.361 --> 31:56.278
Guess the engine
just got flooded.

31:56.280 --> 31:59.614
Yeah, that must be it.

31:59.616 --> 32:00.982
What the...?

32:00.984 --> 32:03.151
Take your hands off me, Reagan.
Hey, hey.

32:03.153 --> 32:04.236
Take your
hands off me.

32:04.238 --> 32:05.287
Jamie. Back up.

32:05.289 --> 32:06.204
Look at me, Reynolds!

32:06.206 --> 32:07.206
This goes to One PP,

32:07.207 --> 32:08.490
and your career is over
the next second,

32:08.492 --> 32:09.825
so shut up and listen to me!

32:11.211 --> 32:13.078
You think Kara Walsh
hung him out to dry--

32:13.080 --> 32:16.081
which she didn't--
so you fail to respond?

32:16.083 --> 32:18.633
Kara Walsh took a bullet
for a fellow officer!

32:18.635 --> 32:21.169
That makes her twice the cop
you'll ever be.

32:21.171 --> 32:23.171
And if you got
a problem with her,

32:23.173 --> 32:25.340
then you got
a problem with me.

32:25.342 --> 32:27.926
And that goes
for everyone else in here.

32:43.527 --> 32:45.694
There you are.

32:49.416 --> 32:51.600
What are you putting
on the podium?

32:51.602 --> 32:53.885
Notes for my briefing.

32:53.887 --> 32:56.121
Like cheat sheets?

32:56.123 --> 32:58.090
Like notes for
my briefing.

32:58.092 --> 33:00.041
Never use them.

33:00.043 --> 33:02.277
I wish you would.

33:03.130 --> 33:04.713
(sighs)

33:04.715 --> 33:06.515
Scanlon's Breathalyzer?

33:06.517 --> 33:08.850
Was probably never administered.

33:10.270 --> 33:11.270
I figured.

33:11.271 --> 33:12.437
What are you
gonna do?

33:12.439 --> 33:14.189
What do you mean,
what am I gonna do?

33:14.191 --> 33:16.808
All you've really got here
is a workplace accident.

33:16.810 --> 33:18.393
We both know better.

33:18.395 --> 33:20.428
No bystanders were
injured, Frank.

33:20.430 --> 33:22.147
Scanlon's a medal
of honor recipient.

33:22.149 --> 33:26.318
Past heroism is no excuse
for present misconduct.

33:26.320 --> 33:28.236
And rules exist for a reason.
I know that.

33:28.238 --> 33:30.906
But we're talking
about humiliating a great cop

33:30.908 --> 33:32.791
a few months short
of retirement.

33:34.178 --> 33:36.461
Can I say
something?

33:37.347 --> 33:39.798
You're asking permission?

33:39.800 --> 33:41.666
For this, yes.

33:43.003 --> 33:44.336
Please.

33:49.343 --> 33:52.511
No one ever laid
on their death bed thinking

33:52.513 --> 33:54.062
they should've been
tougher on their friends

33:54.064 --> 33:55.981
for their missteps.

33:55.983 --> 33:58.767
I can't afford
to think of him as a friend.

33:58.769 --> 34:00.986
I don't think
you can afford not to.

34:11.148 --> 34:13.415
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

34:14.835 --> 34:17.536
Damon... how are you feeling?

34:17.538 --> 34:18.870
Like I got shot.

34:18.871 --> 34:19.871
DANNY:
Good.

34:19.873 --> 34:21.289
Now you know how it feels.

34:21.291 --> 34:23.123
ERIN:
I spoke to your doctor.

34:23.126 --> 34:25.594
He said you're gonna be okay.

34:27.297 --> 34:30.348
We're here to take your
statement on the shooting.

34:31.217 --> 34:32.766
Did you arrest anyone?

34:32.768 --> 34:34.853
Marcus Greene
is in custody.

34:34.855 --> 34:36.137
Did he confess?

34:36.139 --> 34:38.806
He's actually refused
to make a statement.

34:38.809 --> 34:41.476
He doesn't seem
to care much

34:41.478 --> 34:42.978
what happens to him right now.

34:42.980 --> 34:44.813
Pretty much been that way
since his daughter died.

34:44.815 --> 34:46.313
ERIN:
Okay.

34:46.315 --> 34:48.483
I'll take care
of this, Detective.

34:53.422 --> 34:55.790
There are no other witnesses
to the shooting.

34:55.792 --> 34:57.626
No surveillance cameras.

34:57.628 --> 34:59.144
No weapon.

34:59.146 --> 35:01.413
The case hinges
on you making

35:01.415 --> 35:02.714
a positive ID of the shooter.

35:02.716 --> 35:04.666
Without that, we have nothing.

35:08.839 --> 35:11.172
It's funny.

35:12.759 --> 35:14.893
You can live your whole life
the right way,

35:14.895 --> 35:17.896
like Marcus Greene did...

35:17.898 --> 35:20.398
and with one mistake--

35:20.400 --> 35:24.102
a single lapse
of judgment--

35:24.104 --> 35:27.188
ruin your whole life.

35:28.525 --> 35:30.358
And it makes
you wonder...

35:30.360 --> 35:32.410
should a good person

35:32.412 --> 35:34.696
be condemned for his worst act?

35:37.834 --> 35:40.535
Or should he be given
a second chance?

35:42.756 --> 35:44.839
And I think that you,

35:44.841 --> 35:46.875
better than anyone,

35:46.877 --> 35:50.879
should understand what it means
to get a second chance.

35:51.715 --> 35:54.299
So I'm asking
you, Damon...

35:55.469 --> 35:58.219
...did you see who shot you?

36:04.027 --> 36:06.111
No.

36:11.568 --> 36:13.702
I didn't see anyone.

36:39.062 --> 36:41.313
McCOY:
I held off on the champagne.

36:44.901 --> 36:46.434
I'm an idiot.

36:46.436 --> 36:48.987
With very good taste in flowers.

36:48.989 --> 36:50.522
I shouldn't
have told you

36:50.524 --> 36:52.407
I was being considered
for the job that way.

36:52.409 --> 36:53.942
Well, let's just say

36:53.944 --> 36:56.244
it didn't go well
with my hangover.

36:56.246 --> 36:59.247
I know things
between us are...

37:00.867 --> 37:03.168
Actually, I'm not
sure what they are.

37:03.170 --> 37:04.869
But I care about you, Erin.

37:04.871 --> 37:07.288
I care about you, too.

37:07.290 --> 37:09.124
I just need you
to understand that...

37:09.126 --> 37:11.426
I do.
I do.

37:11.428 --> 37:14.262
And I'd never ask you to
compromise your principles.

37:14.264 --> 37:16.047
Your personal morality, yes,

37:16.049 --> 37:18.717
but never
your principles.

37:18.719 --> 37:21.970
Look, becoming Manhattan D.A.,

37:21.972 --> 37:24.222
even for
a short time,

37:24.224 --> 37:26.191
is the opportunity
of a lifetime.

37:26.193 --> 37:27.308
I know.

37:27.310 --> 37:30.395
And I would never
stand in your way.

37:30.397 --> 37:32.614
I've just...

37:32.616 --> 37:36.151
I've worked so hard
to get to where I am.

37:36.153 --> 37:38.203
And I've done it on my own. I...

37:38.205 --> 37:39.738
I tell you what.

37:39.740 --> 37:41.656
If I take the job,

37:41.658 --> 37:44.075
my first official act

37:44.077 --> 37:46.878
will be to demote you
to arraignment court.

37:46.880 --> 37:48.663
(laughing)

37:48.665 --> 37:51.166
I'd like to
see you try.

38:02.512 --> 38:04.512
(seagulls calling)

38:04.514 --> 38:08.600
FRANK: I asked the harbormaster
about our boat.

38:08.602 --> 38:12.854
<i>Queen Mary</i> never made it
through Hurricane Sandy.

38:13.857 --> 38:15.523
Damn shame.

38:15.525 --> 38:16.858
Lot of good memories.

38:16.860 --> 38:18.026
Yeah.

38:20.113 --> 38:21.079
Everyone...

38:21.081 --> 38:24.165
wants this incident
to go away.

38:24.167 --> 38:26.284
Especially me.

38:26.286 --> 38:28.620
But I got
a problem,

38:28.622 --> 38:30.922
and I'm hoping you
could help me with it.

38:34.928 --> 38:36.795
Your partner was
legally intoxicated

38:36.797 --> 38:38.346
when he was shot.

38:38.348 --> 38:42.050
Jimmy Clark is
an excellent detective.

38:42.052 --> 38:44.552
He's suspended.

38:44.554 --> 38:46.187
If you've got a badge
in your pocket

38:46.189 --> 38:47.555
and a gun in
your holster,

38:47.557 --> 38:49.774
you'd damn sure better not
have a drink in your hand.

38:49.776 --> 38:51.976
Yes, sir.

38:54.364 --> 38:57.065
Chris...

38:57.067 --> 38:58.650
I never served with anyone

38:58.652 --> 39:01.569
I trust and respect more.

39:03.707 --> 39:06.574
So if you tell me
you weren't drinking that day,

39:06.576 --> 39:08.243
I'll take you at your word.

39:08.245 --> 39:09.878
You can go back to work.

39:15.969 --> 39:20.922
With my retirement date
creeping up on me...

39:20.924 --> 39:22.807
I was getting kind of scared.

39:24.394 --> 39:25.810
The job's been

39:25.812 --> 39:27.011
my whole life.

39:28.815 --> 39:32.100
Lot of guys with
as much time in as we have,

39:32.102 --> 39:34.853
they're happy to hang it up,
get away.

39:39.826 --> 39:41.442
Thing is...

39:41.444 --> 39:42.944
I love my wife, Frank.

39:42.946 --> 39:45.113
Love my kids.

39:46.032 --> 39:48.249
But between you and me...

39:49.870 --> 39:54.172
...the only time I feel right...

39:54.174 --> 39:56.958
like I'm exactly where
I'm supposed to be...

39:56.960 --> 39:59.093
is when I'm on the job.

40:00.463 --> 40:02.764
And I don't know what
I'm gonna do without that.

40:05.435 --> 40:06.851
I guess my drinking

40:06.853 --> 40:09.637
the last couple
years has...

40:09.639 --> 40:11.890
been my way
of dealing with that.

40:13.476 --> 40:15.977
The wrong way.

40:19.482 --> 40:22.033
No one can take away

40:22.035 --> 40:25.119
what you've meant
to this department.

40:25.121 --> 40:27.322
To me.

40:28.241 --> 40:30.458
Except you.

40:56.686 --> 41:00.738
You said you wanted to retire
with honor, Detective.

41:02.275 --> 41:04.909
You just did.

41:24.965 --> 41:27.715
It's feeling a little
better, though.

41:27.717 --> 41:28.766
Yeah? When do the
stitches come out?

41:28.768 --> 41:29.717
Ah, a few days.

41:29.719 --> 41:31.219
You get some good painkillers?

41:31.221 --> 41:34.022
I should be okay by the
bottom of this pitcher.

41:34.024 --> 41:35.139
(laughs)

41:35.892 --> 41:38.559
Look, so now
that things have

41:38.561 --> 41:39.944
kind of
settled down,

41:39.946 --> 41:42.814
I... I feel like I owe
you an apology.

41:42.816 --> 41:44.399
No, you don't.

41:44.401 --> 41:45.984
Sure she does.

41:45.986 --> 41:48.620
Could you just
drink your beer? Okay?

41:49.739 --> 41:51.406
(laughs)

41:53.076 --> 41:55.326
I'm not totally sure
I agree with what you did,

41:55.328 --> 41:59.330
but you did what you did because you
thought it was right.

41:59.332 --> 42:01.215
And you're a damn good cop,
and I am really sorry

42:01.217 --> 42:03.217
for giving you a hard time.

42:06.306 --> 42:09.340
For that, I'm gonna let you
have your partner back.

42:09.342 --> 42:10.925
Whoa, not so fast.

42:10.927 --> 42:12.477
I really liked riding
with Righetti.

42:12.479 --> 42:14.012
Here we go.
