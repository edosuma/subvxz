00:00.117 --> 00:01.785
Previously on "Music City"...

00:01.885 --> 00:02.719
Hey, girls.

00:02.820 --> 00:03.988
Hey.

00:04.086 --> 00:05.756
Rachyl found herself facing temptation.

00:05.855 --> 00:08.057
I didn't know you were going to be here.

00:08.157 --> 00:10.059
Jackson refused to
listen to Baylee's advice

00:10.160 --> 00:11.420
after his accident.

00:11.475 --> 00:13.131
I'm just kind of worried
that you're overworking.

00:13.233 --> 00:15.066
Just stop telling me
how to live my life.

00:15.165 --> 00:17.934
Bryant crossed the line
when it came to my career.

00:18.034 --> 00:21.138
All I see is a woman
that had so much talent.

00:21.237 --> 00:23.472
But you've picked
another bar to work at.

00:23.572 --> 00:25.976
Once again, Kerry put
his career before Rachyl.

00:26.077 --> 00:28.645
Now we're going broke so
you can have a publicist.

00:28.744 --> 00:31.081
Do you know how disrespectful that is?

00:31.182 --> 00:33.325
And Jessica gave Rachyl
a piece of her mind.

00:33.352 --> 00:35.422
You can't always play the victim.

00:35.676 --> 00:36.801
you, J Mack.

00:36.897 --> 00:39.897
And now their friendship
may be damaged for good.

00:42.557 --> 00:44.225
Babe, on the rocks, please.

00:44.444 --> 00:46.247
You want rocks in your drink, you said?

00:46.347 --> 00:47.908
- Yes.
- Got you.

00:47.976 --> 00:51.747
We really have got to
talk about these RSVPs.

00:51.809 --> 00:53.175
Thank you.

00:53.186 --> 00:55.523
I've been getting all
sorts of texts from everyone.

00:55.623 --> 00:56.657
More yeses or nos?

00:56.757 --> 00:58.159
More yeses.

00:58.258 --> 00:59.292
I'm nervous.

00:59.384 --> 01:00.986
What if we have too many people?

01:00.997 --> 01:04.667
- Maybe you can RSVP "no".
- OK.

01:04.866 --> 01:08.703
So out of our group, we have Alisa,
Alexandra, Bryant, and Jackson.

01:08.803 --> 01:10.738
Wait. So, babe, you're inviting Jackson

01:10.837 --> 01:13.239
to the wedding but not Rachyl.

01:13.340 --> 01:14.311
Correct.

01:14.322 --> 01:16.791
Rachyl and I, we're not
in a good place right now.

01:17.312 --> 01:20.581
We ended up kind of
getting into it at FGL.

01:20.682 --> 01:22.383
I called her a victim.

01:22.483 --> 01:25.286
I said that she shouldn't
act like the victim.

01:25.386 --> 01:27.087
I just want the best for her.

01:27.187 --> 01:32.092
And it's just like we just
don't understand each other.

01:32.193 --> 01:36.197
And I just feel like she doesn't
even consider me a friend anymore.

01:39.801 --> 01:43.271
But do you think you're going
to regret not having her there?

01:43.282 --> 01:47.326
It hurts. And I'm like, I don't want
to feel that way on my wedding day.

01:47.410 --> 01:49.678
Babe, I know that things
are really hard right now,

01:50.176 --> 01:52.145
and things are just weird.

01:52.245 --> 01:53.548
But you invite her.

01:53.648 --> 01:55.283
Kind of leave the ball
in her court, and let her

01:55.383 --> 01:57.384
decide if she's willing to come back.

02:01.188 --> 02:03.223
We'll see.

02:03.324 --> 02:06.494
Yeah. Come here.

02:06.593 --> 02:07.728
I'm so sorry, babe.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.746
Hey, quack, quack. Ooh, sexy.

02:26.862 --> 02:28.563
Guess what I got in the mail?

02:28.649 --> 02:31.151
- What?
- Jessica's wedding invitation.

02:31.251 --> 02:32.553
Huh.

02:32.654 --> 02:33.722
Why?

02:33.822 --> 02:35.823
I have not gotten an invite yet.

02:35.923 --> 02:38.458
- What?
- Yeah.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.794
I kind of went after her at FGL.

02:40.894 --> 02:43.463
If that is the reason for not
inviting someone to a wedding,

02:43.563 --> 02:44.865
that's ridiculous.

02:44.966 --> 02:46.701
You saw how weird she
was acting about Jeremiah

02:46.800 --> 02:48.202
being at the waterfall.

02:48.303 --> 02:49.236
Uh, yeah.

02:49.336 --> 02:50.804
I can not handle that anymore.

02:50.905 --> 02:53.274
I didn't even tell them that
Jeremiah was at the waterfall.

02:53.374 --> 02:54.709
Really?

02:54.809 --> 02:56.377
I mean, obviously, he will find out.

02:56.477 --> 02:57.745
I know.

02:57.845 --> 03:00.382
I don't know. I just did
not want another fight.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.416
Technically, I didn't
know he was coming.

03:02.517 --> 03:04.584
- True.
- I mean, you said.

03:04.685 --> 03:05.887
Kerry cannot control
who I'm friends with.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.456
- No.
- Kerry's with his publicist.

03:08.555 --> 03:11.191
Should I plan some sort
of photo shoot for him?

03:11.292 --> 03:12.794
He has a manager for all that stuff.

03:12.894 --> 03:15.097
I'm curious to see what that is.

03:15.198 --> 03:16.964
- At the shoot?
- Yeah.

03:17.043 --> 03:20.314
Watch it be with, like, four models.

03:20.867 --> 03:24.604
And his shirt's off and oiled up.

03:24.618 --> 03:25.663
I would faint.

03:25.840 --> 03:26.983
Do you want to come?

03:30.436 --> 03:31.611
Yes, please.

03:31.711 --> 03:32.880
This should be fun.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:59.400 --> 04:00.536
- Hey, babe.
- Hi.

04:00.744 --> 04:01.345
How are you?

04:01.757 --> 04:02.692
I'm good. How are you?

04:02.732 --> 04:04.611
- Good.
- I wasn't expecting you.

04:04.711 --> 04:05.714
Yeah.

04:05.813 --> 04:06.846
What are you doing?

04:06.947 --> 04:09.616
Babe, I'm just here to apologize.

04:09.716 --> 04:10.851
Well, thank you.

04:10.952 --> 04:13.596
- Can I sit?
- Yeah, of course.

04:15.457 --> 04:16.923
What's up?

04:17.023 --> 04:18.791
I was kind of quick to jump on you

04:18.892 --> 04:22.530
for calling me out for being too
aggressive with my job and all

04:22.629 --> 04:23.605
that kind of stuff.

04:23.616 --> 04:27.152
And I feel like this car wreck
has really, really thrown me

04:28.035 --> 04:30.905
for a loop, because I'm not in
control of things right now.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.423
And I like being in control of my life.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.876
I mean, everybody wants to
be in control of their life.

04:35.977 --> 04:37.779
And there's just going
to be some things that

04:37.878 --> 04:39.614
happen sometimes that you can't control.

04:39.713 --> 04:42.482
You're a really hard worker,
and it's very admirable,

04:42.559 --> 04:43.890
your work ethic.

04:43.925 --> 04:49.422
But at the same time, you need to
take a break every now and then.

04:49.523 --> 04:50.758
I just want to make you happy.

04:50.857 --> 04:51.991
I think we...

04:52.092 --> 04:53.761
I mean, you make me happy every day.

04:53.861 --> 04:57.465
I don't think you have to run
yourself ragged to do that.

04:57.564 --> 04:58.665
I don't want to fail you.

04:58.765 --> 05:00.734
I just want to be the best for you.

05:00.835 --> 05:02.970
- I love you.
- And I just want you to know I'm going

05:03.071 --> 05:04.405
to be better going forward.

05:04.504 --> 05:07.774
And I can't do this stuff without you.

05:07.874 --> 05:09.976
And I don't want you to give up on us.

05:10.076 --> 05:11.578
I'm not going to give up on us.

05:24.592 --> 05:26.995
I think my sister called,
and she wants her pants back.

05:27.095 --> 05:27.861
You look great.

05:27.962 --> 05:29.263
Whatever you say.

05:29.393 --> 05:30.562
There's some other stuff here.

05:30.631 --> 05:31.364
But I think that... no.

05:31.465 --> 05:32.000
Yeah.

05:32.029 --> 05:34.396
- Well, not that.
- Why are there girls' clothes here?

05:34.407 --> 05:36.675
I have a female model
that's coming to do

05:36.942 --> 05:39.543
a couple of the shots with you.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.442
- With me?
- Yeah.

05:41.542 --> 05:42.476
Hm, yeah.

05:42.575 --> 05:44.044
Just trust me.

05:44.145 --> 05:45.547
You know who looks really
good with me though is Rachyl.

05:45.647 --> 05:46.580
Well, I know.

05:46.681 --> 05:48.549
But it's not family photo time.

05:48.648 --> 05:49.949
What we're trying to get here today

05:50.049 --> 05:53.720
is some sexier photos that
we can put on Instagram.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.422
We can use for the upcoming shows.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.525
What I don't understand is if we're

05:57.624 --> 06:00.494
trying to get pictures of me not
with a female, as in my wife,

06:00.595 --> 06:02.462
why are we taking pictures
of me with a female?

06:02.563 --> 06:04.832
It's just going to open you
up a little bit more to look

06:04.931 --> 06:06.434
more accessible.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.002
Like these young girls
who are looking up to you,

06:08.102 --> 06:10.938
they want to fantasize getting
to be up close and personal.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.025
With a female?

06:12.111 --> 06:13.607
Well, I trust you with my brand, OK,

06:13.708 --> 06:14.741
but I'm going to agree
on certain things.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.236
And this one I don't agree with.

06:16.266 --> 06:19.268
We won't release anything
until you approve it.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.815
Mhm.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.684
OK?

06:23.784 --> 06:25.386
Sexy, here we go.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.727
Bring your eyes to me.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.328
Perfect.

06:34.421 --> 06:36.688
Kerry, this is Caroline.

06:36.788 --> 06:38.699
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you as well.

06:38.719 --> 06:40.001
I asked her to come in
for a few of those photos.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.470
- Thanks for your help.
- All right, let's have you sitting back on the couch.

06:43.436 --> 06:44.371
Yeah, lean into him.

06:44.472 --> 06:45.773
I mean, don't... there you go.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.074
Smile a little bit more.

06:50.710 --> 06:51.845
All right, let's have
you be on top of him.

06:51.946 --> 06:53.481
Yeah, just right on top of him.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.982
That's just a little too much for me.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.918
We're going to the next pose.

06:57.018 --> 06:57.952
OK.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.087
Yep, flex it up. Perfect.

07:03.090 --> 07:07.695
I'm going to get a smile out of you.
I swear.

07:07.794 --> 07:08.662
Baby.

07:08.763 --> 07:10.364
There's a smile.

07:10.463 --> 07:12.465
Make it more playful, like
you're listening to him,

07:12.566 --> 07:13.400
having a good time.

07:13.501 --> 07:15.001
This is so awkward.

07:15.102 --> 07:15.770
I know.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.804
Do you know her?

07:17.905 --> 07:19.073
No.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.908
Kind of put your head on his chest.

07:21.008 --> 07:21.775
Just seriously.

07:21.876 --> 07:24.145
Yeah, stop.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.712
I mean...

07:25.813 --> 07:28.482
I think Tori told
them to pose like that.

07:28.583 --> 07:30.450
I mean, I don't mind
if he does photo shoots.

07:30.551 --> 07:31.986
But this makes no sense.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.853
No, this is the weirdest
thing I've ever seen in my life.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.656
This is bad for his music career.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.458
I don't see anything relating to music.

07:37.558 --> 07:40.794
He's an established, skilled musician.

07:40.893 --> 07:42.062
What is this doing?

07:44.631 --> 07:46.467
That's great. Yeah, those are great.

07:47.602 --> 07:49.402
You know that I'm so automatic.

07:49.503 --> 07:50.438
Yeah, really lean on him.

07:51.672 --> 07:52.941
He looks so mad right now.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.474
Grab her leg.

07:55.910 --> 07:57.477
Come on. Don't you wish you had it?

07:57.578 --> 07:58.779
What?

07:58.878 --> 08:02.450
I think that you should say something.

08:04.919 --> 08:06.087
Rachyl?

08:06.186 --> 08:07.789
- Hey.
- Hi, I'm Caroline.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.100
Hi, I'm Rachyl. I'm Kerry's wife.

08:09.111 --> 08:10.190
Nice to meet you.

08:10.289 --> 08:11.818
Nice to meet you.

08:11.873 --> 08:13.275
Hi, I'm Caroline.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.695
That was weird.

08:14.796 --> 08:16.196
That model just makes no sense.

08:16.296 --> 08:17.865
People know you're married with a kid.

08:17.965 --> 08:20.001
It's just going to make you look bad.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.734
I felt really awkward.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.137
I didn't know this was happening.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.071
You didn't know the girl
was going to be there.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.562
- Yeah.
- Hi, everyone.

08:26.600 --> 08:26.967
Hello.

08:26.983 --> 08:27.629
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.233
- I'm Tori.
- Ali, good to meet you.

08:29.244 --> 08:30.530
- Hi, how are you?
- Great to meet you.

08:30.541 --> 08:33.499
- How are we doing? Are we almost ready?
- This makes no sense, Tori.

08:33.510 --> 08:35.390
What is the point of this photo shoot?

08:36.017 --> 08:38.085
To show him as just a young artist.

08:38.186 --> 08:40.988
And it's really great to
have him posed with somebody

08:41.089 --> 08:42.789
that we're trying to appeal to.

08:42.889 --> 08:45.960
It's like a fantasy type of
thing, like one of his fans.

08:46.060 --> 08:47.561
My fans.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.930
Then you could shoot a
show with like young girls

08:50.029 --> 08:51.497
in the audience or something.

08:51.598 --> 08:52.233
We have that too.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.900
We just need variety.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.802
I want to see how these will perform.

08:55.902 --> 08:58.572
We're trying to still
work through his brand.

08:58.672 --> 09:01.174
I agree that it also doesn't
make any sense to me right now.

09:01.274 --> 09:04.077
But any time you're modeling,
you're modeling for a brand.

09:04.177 --> 09:05.245
There's a purpose to it.

09:05.256 --> 09:06.390
This is the Kerry Degman brand.

09:06.401 --> 09:08.782
- This is my brand.
- Yeah, well, we talked about this before.

09:08.883 --> 09:09.984
I get what everyone's saying... I think

09:10.084 --> 09:12.520
it is awkward, very awkward.

09:12.619 --> 09:13.921
And this is my brand.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.024
And my brand needs to look
how I want it to look.

09:27.346 --> 09:30.986
- Look at this cute little shop.
- Isn't it adorable?

09:31.158 --> 09:32.493
This place is so cute.

09:32.592 --> 09:35.228
Hi.

09:38.625 --> 09:39.342
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:39.353 --> 09:40.185
Welcome in.

09:40.252 --> 09:41.419
Thank you.

09:41.430 --> 09:43.332
Are you looking for
anything in particular?

09:43.787 --> 09:45.956
Yes, I'm getting married.

09:46.056 --> 09:47.982
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

09:47.993 --> 09:51.412
I'm looking for what flowers
I want to be in the wedding.

09:51.423 --> 09:52.436
OK.

09:52.447 --> 09:53.748
Well, just take a look
around this table.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.452
This is everything we have out today.

09:55.699 --> 09:56.499
OK, cool.

09:56.600 --> 09:57.900
Thank you.

09:58.002 --> 09:59.136
Oh, my gosh, so many options.

09:59.236 --> 10:00.170
What's your color scheme?

10:00.271 --> 10:01.839
I know.

10:01.939 --> 10:05.677
I'm thinking like soft pinks.

10:05.776 --> 10:06.978
These are so pretty.

10:07.078 --> 10:07.879
Right?

10:07.978 --> 10:09.446
I definitely want roses.

10:09.546 --> 10:10.580
Those never go out of style.

10:10.680 --> 10:12.682
- Yeah.
- Thank you for coming with me.

10:12.782 --> 10:14.918
Of course. I'm glad I
could be moral support.

10:15.018 --> 10:16.754
For sure. I wanted a second opinion.

10:16.853 --> 10:17.988
Yeah, definitely.

10:18.089 --> 10:19.724
- Girl's day.
- Girl's day.

10:19.824 --> 10:22.125
I've been meaning to ask.
How's music going?

10:22.225 --> 10:24.160
It's going good actually.

10:24.253 --> 10:25.888
- Yeah?
- Better than it has been.

10:25.997 --> 10:26.618
OK.

10:26.629 --> 10:29.719
- I actually reached out to Kerry.
- OK.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.628
Yeah, because I was like,
he co-writes with everybody.

10:32.639 --> 10:34.722
So I figured he would
have some good connects,

10:34.906 --> 10:36.840
and maybe he could put
me in touch with someone.

10:36.940 --> 10:39.911
And he told me that he has
a friend named Luke Pell.

10:40.011 --> 10:41.112
Oh.

10:41.212 --> 10:42.213
Who's like... I don't really know him.

10:42.313 --> 10:43.648
We've never met.

10:43.747 --> 10:44.949
But I know he's a little more involved

10:45.049 --> 10:46.150
in the country music industry.

10:46.249 --> 10:47.750
Yeah.

10:47.850 --> 10:48.652
So I feel like I've
definitely heard that name.

10:48.752 --> 10:49.719
Mhm.

10:49.820 --> 10:50.555
We were supposed to meet tonight.

10:50.655 --> 10:51.856
OK.

10:51.955 --> 10:54.691
And we'll see if we can write together.

10:54.791 --> 10:55.758
I'm excited for you.

10:55.858 --> 10:57.093
This is a big step.

10:57.194 --> 10:59.642
- I'm just trying to get out there.
- That's good.

10:59.653 --> 11:01.021
Stop being nervous
about it and just do it.

11:01.032 --> 11:02.166
I'm already assuming that we're writing.

11:02.266 --> 11:04.135
- Yeah.
- Like because he's going to love me, duh.

11:04.234 --> 11:06.236
- He is.
- He's going to want to write with me.

11:06.335 --> 11:06.970
How could he not?

11:07.070 --> 11:07.738
I'm fantastic.

11:07.838 --> 11:08.906
But we'll see.

11:09.006 --> 11:09.874
That's right, babe.

11:09.973 --> 11:11.507
This is so... I love that.

11:11.608 --> 11:13.109
I love how pink those are.

11:13.209 --> 11:16.781
Have you talked to Rachyl since...

11:16.881 --> 11:20.651
No, we have not talked
since the FGL House.

11:20.751 --> 11:21.752
I have to apologize.

11:21.763 --> 11:22.546
Why?

11:22.557 --> 11:25.690
For... I didn't know that you
and Rachyl were going to get

11:25.790 --> 11:26.591
into it.

11:26.690 --> 11:28.091
That was not the plan.

11:28.191 --> 11:29.259
No, I know.

11:29.359 --> 11:30.961
I knew your intentions were good.

11:31.061 --> 11:33.096
Her and Kerry have something going on.

11:33.196 --> 11:35.899
And as a friend, I don't like
to see her in this state.

11:35.999 --> 11:39.002
But I just have to let her
make her own decisions.

11:39.103 --> 11:40.939
It's not our marriage.

11:41.039 --> 11:43.207
That is true.

11:43.308 --> 11:45.876
I want to talk it out with her.

11:45.975 --> 11:48.044
I mean, to be honest, since that night,

11:48.145 --> 11:49.545
I've already started to miss her.

11:49.646 --> 11:52.049
And I'm wanting to clear the air.

11:52.148 --> 11:54.517
But I haven't decided whether or not

11:54.618 --> 11:56.711
you no matter I'm going to
invite her to the wedding.

11:56.735 --> 11:59.189
That's a little extreme.

11:59.289 --> 12:01.725
I mean, I get it.
Dre says the same thing.

12:01.825 --> 12:03.226
But we'll see what happens.

12:03.326 --> 12:05.095
Well, hopefully you guys
can work it out before then.

12:05.195 --> 12:06.863
Yeah, I hope so.

12:06.964 --> 12:09.767
I want us to all be cool
and ready for your wedding.

12:09.867 --> 12:10.668
I want that to.

12:11.935 --> 12:14.104
♪ I can feel it sinking in.

12:20.076 --> 12:21.244
♪ You got me once.

12:23.981 --> 12:25.315
- Cheers.
- Yeah, man.

12:25.415 --> 12:27.072
Good to see you out.

12:28.218 --> 12:29.587
How you been?

12:29.686 --> 12:32.154
Just, you know, trying
to make it happen.

12:32.256 --> 12:34.521
I invited a friend to meet you.

12:34.532 --> 12:35.201
Yeah.

12:35.212 --> 12:38.228
Alisa... I'm hoping that there
can be a write in the works

12:38.328 --> 12:38.929
or something.

12:39.028 --> 12:39.763
Yeah.

12:39.863 --> 12:41.031
She's not ugly.

12:41.131 --> 12:42.632
She's got an incredible voice.

12:42.733 --> 12:44.234
Writing is always a good place to start.

12:44.334 --> 12:46.804
And that's a good place to
figure people out anyway.

12:46.903 --> 12:47.670
Oh, right.

12:47.771 --> 12:48.939
It gets deep quick.

12:49.039 --> 12:52.276
Yeah, I hear that.

12:52.376 --> 12:53.977
How's the fam?

12:54.076 --> 12:57.047
Man, kid's terrorizing all
the other kids in daycare.

12:57.147 --> 12:59.216
And every time I pick him
up, he's just on time out.

12:59.316 --> 13:00.750
I don't know how you do it, man.

13:00.852 --> 13:02.151
I got a dog, and I can't keep him

13:02.252 --> 13:03.353
from peeing on the floor, man.

13:03.454 --> 13:04.722
That's all I can handle, man.

13:04.821 --> 13:06.055
A dog was like the perfect training

13:06.156 --> 13:07.590
to prepare you for
having a kid, because you

13:07.690 --> 13:09.093
learn that if you don't train your dog,

13:09.193 --> 13:10.661
your life is miserable.

13:10.761 --> 13:12.029
Yeah.

13:12.128 --> 13:13.829
- Hi, friends.
- Hey, good to see you.

13:13.930 --> 13:15.132
You too.

13:15.225 --> 13:16.058
Thanks for joining us.

13:16.166 --> 13:17.163
- Of course.
- What's up?

13:17.189 --> 13:18.405
- Alisa, Luke.
- Luke, Alisa.

13:18.459 --> 13:20.022
Luke, I've heard so much about you.

13:20.033 --> 13:20.768
Nice to meet you.

13:20.779 --> 13:21.959
- Nice to see you.
- Awesome.

13:21.970 --> 13:23.444
Kerry was telling me all about you.

13:23.455 --> 13:24.810
I'm crashing your boys' party.

13:24.909 --> 13:25.710
No, come on in.

13:25.810 --> 13:26.776
I'm glad you made it.

13:26.877 --> 13:27.978
Where's my drink?

13:28.078 --> 13:29.180
You're not drinking beers with us?

13:29.280 --> 13:31.115
No, tequila all day.

13:31.214 --> 13:32.615
Oh, we'll just get you a bottle.

13:32.717 --> 13:33.417
Perfect.

13:33.517 --> 13:35.786
Get you your own bottle.

13:35.886 --> 13:37.722
At least tequila, all right.

13:37.821 --> 13:39.301
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

13:39.324 --> 13:41.057
How long have you guys known each other?

13:41.157 --> 13:42.058
For a while now.

13:42.159 --> 13:43.160
She's friends with my wife.

13:43.260 --> 13:44.715
- Oh, nice.
- Yeah.

13:44.726 --> 13:46.630
Have you written with
other people in town already?

13:46.729 --> 13:48.197
How's it been going?

13:48.297 --> 13:50.267
Yeah, the one song that he
knows that I actually completed

13:50.367 --> 13:52.036
was with a guy I dated.

13:52.136 --> 13:55.039
But I'm kind of wondering
if maybe it would be easier

13:55.138 --> 13:56.205
to write with a stranger.

13:56.305 --> 13:56.975
I think it is.

13:57.014 --> 13:59.243
It's like giving a speech
to someone you know versus...

13:59.343 --> 14:00.276
Someone you don't know.

14:00.377 --> 14:01.411
...a group of strangers, right?

14:01.512 --> 14:02.680
It's always easier with a stranger.

14:02.780 --> 14:03.380
OK.

14:03.479 --> 14:04.949
Do you play guitar?

14:05.049 --> 14:07.017
I mean, I play enough to get by.

14:07.117 --> 14:08.953
I can pick like four chords, maybe five.

14:09.052 --> 14:10.286
That's country music.

14:10.387 --> 14:12.055
Hey, that's all you
need for country music.

14:12.155 --> 14:14.791
You're going to need to bring
your guitar to our co-write.

14:14.892 --> 14:17.326
He hasn't physically said,
I would like to co-write with

14:17.426 --> 14:18.728
you.

14:18.829 --> 14:19.729
He's going to co-write with me, OK?

14:19.830 --> 14:20.730
I mean...

14:20.830 --> 14:21.931
She's got control issues.

14:22.032 --> 14:23.433
You've twisted my arm, I guess.

14:23.534 --> 14:24.401
I feel like...

14:24.501 --> 14:25.269
I've got control issues.

14:25.368 --> 14:26.170
I've been set up.

14:26.270 --> 14:27.071
Now I've got no way out.

14:27.170 --> 14:28.037
You've got no way out.

14:28.137 --> 14:29.040
I'm not mad about it.

14:29.140 --> 14:29.941
I'm not mad about it at all.

14:30.041 --> 14:30.840
I'm excited about it.

14:30.940 --> 14:31.742
You won't be let down.

14:31.842 --> 14:32.776
She's a talented writer.

14:47.895 --> 14:51.532
That's cool.

14:51.631 --> 14:53.267
But it's a sad ballad.

14:53.278 --> 14:54.994
- "Dear Love," that's the title of it?
- Mhm.

14:55.005 --> 14:56.848
- That's awesome.
- Thank you

14:56.879 --> 14:59.208
- I love to write. All of my songs like that
- It's a lot of feels.

14:59.219 --> 15:02.351
- All of the feels.
- Yeah, I'm like I need to stop.

15:02.361 --> 15:03.228
Do you want to cry?

15:03.239 --> 15:05.209
- Do you want to cry so bad?
- I don't know I'm sweating a little.

15:05.227 --> 15:06.159
Gah-lee.

15:06.737 --> 15:08.073
Now, who'd you right this with?

15:08.210 --> 15:09.310
His name is Bryant.

15:09.727 --> 15:11.662
- And this is your ex now?
- Yeah.

15:11.673 --> 15:13.279
- OK.
- We did write a few songs together.

15:13.318 --> 15:15.576
But that one, I would
say, is my favorite one.

15:15.641 --> 15:17.732
I cried, and I never cry.

15:17.743 --> 15:19.339
You cried when you
were writing the song?

15:19.350 --> 15:20.464
- Yeah.
- Oh, wow.

15:20.475 --> 15:22.956
Because I felt like
those are my feelings.

15:22.967 --> 15:25.599
- Yeah.
- And everything I had, I put into that song.

15:25.699 --> 15:28.368
- That's great.
- Which I never wanted to do before.

15:28.468 --> 15:29.602
That's hard to do.

15:29.703 --> 15:31.371
What if you played it on the phone,

15:31.472 --> 15:33.284
but maybe if we just play around
with that for a little bit,

15:33.302 --> 15:34.269
that will give us an idea.

15:34.343 --> 15:36.078
- How do you feel...
- I might have the chords.

15:36.092 --> 15:36.793
OK.

15:36.811 --> 15:39.337
Here we go. That's the first verse.

15:39.456 --> 15:41.666
There we go, first verse.

15:49.957 --> 15:54.284
It sounds so much different on guitar.
And I love it.

15:55.396 --> 16:02.737
♪ The lies I told
myself that it'll be OK, ♪

16:02.837 --> 16:09.644
♪ I created a fairy tale and
lost the strength to walk away. ♪

16:09.743 --> 16:16.516
♪ I thought this letter would
help mend my brokenness. ♪

16:16.617 --> 16:24.791
♪ I finally figured it out we're
so much better than this. ♪

16:24.802 --> 16:26.204
Oh, my god, I'm like, this is magic.

16:26.215 --> 16:27.962
- Yeah, this is great.
- This is so much better on guitar.

16:27.973 --> 16:29.986
You sound really good
singing that, so good.

16:30.016 --> 16:31.806
Right now, it's just so
ballad-y and heartbreak.

16:31.817 --> 16:33.431
- Yeah.
- But I think with the guitar, it's

16:33.442 --> 16:35.517
like, we're moving
into the country genre.

16:35.547 --> 16:37.783
Yeah, I get a little
campfire feel to it a little.

16:37.794 --> 16:39.384
- Yes, yes.
- I love it.

16:39.395 --> 16:41.341
Would you be down just to record this?

16:41.435 --> 16:43.583
And if I could be a part
of it, that'd be crazy.

16:43.594 --> 16:46.365
- OK.
- It would be cool, though, to do it just a more country

16:46.381 --> 16:47.148
version of it.

16:47.159 --> 16:47.927
It would be amazing.

16:47.938 --> 16:49.021
Yeah, like a duet.

16:49.032 --> 16:49.600
Yeah.

16:49.611 --> 16:50.310
Oh, I'd love that.

16:50.321 --> 16:51.857
It would take the song
to a whole other level.

16:51.868 --> 16:54.083
I would just coattail
ride on your amazing voice.

16:54.094 --> 16:55.463
It's insane.

16:55.474 --> 16:59.011
OK, he has to approve of
me doing anything with it.

16:59.107 --> 17:00.445
Most people will.

17:00.464 --> 17:02.099
But do you think that
he's still clinging

17:02.145 --> 17:04.079
on to the relationship or what?

17:04.469 --> 17:07.071
Me, personally, I have no
attachment to him anymore.

17:07.172 --> 17:11.076
- Right.
- We've had more arguments post breaking up.

17:11.175 --> 17:13.344
I feel like this is
an opportunity for you

17:13.444 --> 17:15.246
to show him "I'm moving on."

17:16.615 --> 17:17.415
♪ Let's break the tension, baby. ♪

17:17.516 --> 17:18.017
Yeah.

17:36.501 --> 17:38.937
Hey, what's up?

17:39.038 --> 17:40.471
- Hey.
- Do you have a minute?

17:40.572 --> 17:41.206
Yeah.

17:41.306 --> 17:43.709
Come on in.

17:43.808 --> 17:45.243
I just put Wolf down.

17:45.344 --> 17:47.947
So I was just making
lemonade in the kitchen.

17:48.047 --> 17:49.272
Do you want some help?

17:51.650 --> 17:53.485
I'm going to be honest.

17:53.585 --> 17:57.288
I came over because we haven't talked

17:57.388 --> 17:59.690
in a while since FGL House.

17:59.790 --> 18:02.994
And I feel like that
conversation hopefully

18:03.095 --> 18:05.564
was not what either one of
us really wanted it to be.

18:05.663 --> 18:07.231
Yeah, that got out of hand.

18:07.332 --> 18:09.068
I know feelings were hurt.

18:09.168 --> 18:09.668
Mine were hurt.

18:09.768 --> 18:11.002
Yours were hurt.

18:11.103 --> 18:14.972
And so I just wanted to apologize,

18:15.073 --> 18:18.576
because I shouldn't
have told you that you

18:18.676 --> 18:20.445
shouldn't play the victim.

18:20.546 --> 18:22.147
And as soon as I said it, I wished

18:22.247 --> 18:25.584
I could have taken it back,
because I knew that wasn't

18:25.683 --> 18:26.750
what needed to be said.

18:26.851 --> 18:28.387
I'm obviously sorry too.

18:28.487 --> 18:33.025
I got really emotional and
definitely overreacted,

18:33.124 --> 18:37.262
which I have a tendency to do.

18:37.363 --> 18:39.497
So I'm sorry for that.

18:39.596 --> 18:41.466
Whatever happens with you and Kerry,

18:41.567 --> 18:44.069
I can't fully understand
where you're coming from.

18:44.170 --> 18:47.038
But I at least want to learn
how to be there for you.

18:47.138 --> 18:48.372
And let's just leave it at that.

18:48.473 --> 18:50.275
We don't even have to
talk about your marriage

18:50.286 --> 18:51.554
if you don't want to.

18:51.671 --> 18:53.139
Ball's in your court.

18:53.239 --> 18:55.474
I'm not going to force this.

18:55.574 --> 18:57.610
But I do want you to
know I'm here if you

18:57.710 --> 18:59.960
want me to be here for you.

19:00.020 --> 19:02.187
And that's why I came over here today,

19:02.348 --> 19:09.156
because I wanted to personally
invite you to my wedding.

19:09.255 --> 19:14.995
And so I don't want you to not be there.

19:15.094 --> 19:17.663
And I had this temptation
to not invite you,

19:17.764 --> 19:20.366
only because I didn't know
if you would accept it.

19:20.466 --> 19:22.569
And I didn't want to be rejected by you

19:22.668 --> 19:24.170
like I've felt like I've been.

19:27.239 --> 19:29.043
If you want to, I'd love
for you to be there.

19:34.648 --> 19:36.483
Thanks for inviting me.

19:36.582 --> 19:39.452
Yeah.

19:39.552 --> 19:41.187
So you'll come?

19:41.198 --> 19:42.399
Oh, yeah.

19:42.463 --> 19:43.397
Good.

19:43.408 --> 19:45.142
Well, I'm glad you came over.

19:45.457 --> 19:46.592
Me too.

19:46.693 --> 19:49.263
I was really thirsty, so this is great.

20:07.668 --> 20:08.569
Hey.

20:08.983 --> 20:09.849
Hello.

20:09.950 --> 20:11.919
How was your day?

20:12.019 --> 20:13.153
It was good.

20:13.252 --> 20:15.922
You?

20:16.021 --> 20:17.557
Jessica came over today.

20:17.657 --> 20:20.261
And we finally got an
invite to her wedding.

20:20.360 --> 20:22.829
What took her so long?

20:22.928 --> 20:24.531
We've just been disagreeing on stuff.

20:24.637 --> 20:27.568
How did that go?
I haven't heard about it.

20:27.667 --> 20:28.902
I don't know.

20:29.002 --> 20:30.169
I was just taking a break from her

20:30.270 --> 20:33.941
because she has opinions
about everything.

20:34.040 --> 20:35.332
Hm.

20:37.344 --> 20:38.112
We worked it out.

20:38.212 --> 20:40.580
Everything's fine now.

20:40.681 --> 20:41.933
OK.

20:50.925 --> 20:53.568
I'm glad it all worked out.

20:58.621 --> 21:00.245
Next time on Music City

21:00.966 --> 21:02.558
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

21:02.569 --> 21:05.205
The first problem, you guys
weren't having a good time.

21:05.216 --> 21:07.080
Can I hear it before I sign off on it?

21:07.121 --> 21:09.291
Can I see that it's being done right?

21:09.910 --> 21:11.111
So what did you think?

21:14.247 --> 21:16.149
You all know that
Jessica's getting married.

21:16.484 --> 21:18.119
This is the first I've heard about it.

21:18.218 --> 21:19.086
No way.

21:19.187 --> 21:21.155
Real quick, when is it?

21:21.254 --> 21:23.224
It's next weekend.

21:23.323 --> 21:25.860
I appreciate you ending
things with Jeremiah.
