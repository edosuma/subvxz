00:08.383 --> 00:10.342

he told me something.

00:10.510 --> 00:11.552
Something about you.

-What?
-That I might have to kill you.

-What's that supposed to mean?
-I don't know.

00:16.224 --> 00:18.017
Did he know the demon's plans
for me?

35:28.000 --> 35:30.335
...Margaret could've had
something to do with it?

35:30.878 --> 35:33.338
-We don't know.
-But it's possible.

35:33.548 --> 35:34.589
Yeah.

35:37.218 --> 35:39.219
Susan, I'm sorry.

35:39.554 --> 35:41.680
My God, you have nothing
to apologize for.

35:41.889 --> 35:43.723
You've given me everything.

35:46.811 --> 35:49.354
-Ready to go, kiddo?
-Yeah.

35:49.856 --> 35:51.731
You're sure Maggie's
not around anymore?

35:51.899 --> 35:53.733
I'm sure. I'd see her.

35:59.740 --> 36:02.742
Well, I guess whatever's going on
must be over.

36:07.081 --> 36:09.875
You two take care
of yourselves, all right?

36:13.588 --> 36:15.380
Thank you.

36:15.590 --> 36:16.756
Yeah.

36:16.924 --> 36:18.592
Both of you.

36:27.101 --> 36:29.978
I think you could've hooked up
some MILF action there, bud.

36:30.146 --> 36:33.356
-I'm serious, I think she liked you.
-Yeah, that's all she needs.

36:33.566 --> 36:36.943
Well, you saved the mom,
you saved the girl, not a bad day.

36:37.153 --> 36:40.780
I could have saved them myself but
I didn't want you to feel useless.

36:40.948 --> 36:43.241
All right. I appreciate it.

36:43.451 --> 36:46.453
Feels good getting back
in the saddle, doesn't it?

36:46.746 --> 36:48.163
Yeah.

36:48.789 --> 36:49.789
Yeah, it does.

36:49.957 --> 36:52.918
But it doesn't change what we
talked about last night, Dean.

36:54.295 --> 36:56.421
We talked about
a lot of things last night.

36:57.006 --> 36:58.924
-You know what I mean.
-You were wasted.

36:59.091 --> 37:00.467
But you weren't.

37:01.010 --> 37:02.761
And you promised.

38:13.708 --> 38:18.753
