13:54.460 --> 13:57.379
I BELIEVE IT'S YOUR TURN
TO CLEAN THE BLACKBOARDS.

13:57.546 --> 13:59.173
YES, MA'AM.

14:04.762 --> 14:06.514
LAURA?

14:08.098 --> 14:10.351
DID YOU WISH TO SPEAK
TO ME ABOUT SOMETHING?

14:12.228 --> 14:15.814
WELL, I, UH...

14:15.981 --> 14:18.150
I WANTED...

14:18.317 --> 14:21.487
I HOPE YOU HAVE
A GOOD TIME, TOO.

14:21.654 --> 14:23.447
THANK YOU, LAURA.

14:36.669 --> 14:38.879
WAIT A MINUTE, MARY.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.130
WHAT?

14:40.297 --> 14:42.007
I REMEMBER I FORGOT SOMETHING.
I HAVE TO GO BACK.

14:42.174 --> 14:43.092
OH, FIDDLE.

14:43.259 --> 14:44.802
YOU REALLY ARE
A FLUTTERBUDGET.

14:44.969 --> 14:45.928
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

14:46.095 --> 14:47.263
OH, NO. YOU DON'T
HAVE TO COME.

14:47.429 --> 14:49.473
YOU CAN WAIT HERE.
I'LL RUN ALL THE WAY.

15:00.359 --> 15:01.986
[FOOTSTEPS]

15:06.198 --> 15:08.325
WE'RE HAVING A PICNIC
AT CATTAIL LAKE TOMORROW.

15:08.492 --> 15:09.827
THE FISHING'S REAL GOOD.

15:09.994 --> 15:12.496
SEE YOU
OUT THERE...EARLY!

15:22.381 --> 15:24.466
OH.

15:33.392 --> 15:36.145
DON'T WORRY, JOHNNY.
I'M A GOOD COOK.

15:39.189 --> 15:42.693
DO YOU WANT TO COME?

15:42.860 --> 15:44.820
DON'T MIND IF I DO.

15:55.247 --> 15:58.000
JUST LIKE PA.

16:05.758 --> 16:07.426
OH!

16:07.593 --> 16:09.762
YOU GAVE ME A START,
SNEAKING UP ON ME LIKE THAT.

16:09.928 --> 16:11.263
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
SNEAKING?

16:11.430 --> 16:12.973
BOOK OF ETIQUETTE SAYS WHEN
YOU'RE KISSED BY A MAN,

16:13.140 --> 16:14.308
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO KISS HIM BACK.

16:14.475 --> 16:15.768
OH, IT DOES?

16:15.934 --> 16:18.437
YES. THAT'S THE CHARLES
INGALLS BOOK OF ETIQUETTE.

[JACK BARKING]

16:26.862 --> 16:28.781
HI, JACK!

16:35.829 --> 16:38.415
OH, PA, THANK YOU!

16:38.582 --> 16:39.958
FOR WHAT, HALF-PINT?

16:40.125 --> 16:42.461
FOR A WISH
THAT'S COME TRUE.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.803
DON'T LOOK AT ME.
SHE'S YOUR DAUGHTER.

16:53.180 --> 16:56.392
WE'VE GOT TO GET
THAT KEROSENE CAN REFILLED.

16:56.558 --> 17:00.479
YES. LET'S SEE.
WE NEED NAVY BEANS...

17:00.646 --> 17:02.523
- ALL RIGHT.
- FLOUR...

17:02.690 --> 17:04.400
UH, SALT, TEA...

17:04.566 --> 17:07.569
AND, UH, LET'S HAVE
A LITTLE WHITE SUGAR.

17:07.736 --> 17:09.029
ALL FINISHED, MA.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.657
SPICK-AND-SPAN OR JUST
A LICK AND A PROMISE?

17:11.824 --> 17:13.992
I EVEN FOUND
THAT RIBBON I LOST.

17:14.159 --> 17:16.370
IT WAS WAY, WAY
UNDER THE BED.

17:16.537 --> 17:18.831
WHERE ELSE WOULD IT BE?

17:18.997 --> 17:21.166
CAN I TAKE ALONG
THE OATMEAL COOKIES?

17:21.333 --> 17:22.918
CERTAINLY.

17:24.962 --> 17:27.381
YOU'RE REALLY IN A HURRY
THIS MORNING, HALF-PINT.

17:27.548 --> 17:29.633
YOU SAY THE FISH
BITE BEST EARLY.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.219
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO USE
FOR BAIT--OATMEAL COOKIES?

17:32.386 --> 17:33.846
'COURSE NOT.
GRUBS AND WORMS.

17:34.012 --> 17:35.681
IT'S AN AWFUL BIG LUNCH
FOR ONE LITTLE GIRL.

17:35.848 --> 17:37.599
WELL, FISHING MAKES
ME REAL HUNGRY.

17:37.766 --> 17:38.976
BYE, MA. BYE, PA.

17:39.143 --> 17:41.061
YOU BE CAREFUL.

17:41.228 --> 17:42.938
WHAT ABOUT THE DOOR?

17:59.997 --> 18:01.957
Johnny: HEY, THERE!

18:03.542 --> 18:05.377
OH, HI!

18:05.544 --> 18:06.712
HI.

18:06.879 --> 18:08.255
THIS IS JACK.

18:08.422 --> 18:09.506
HI, JACK. HOW YOU DOING?

18:09.673 --> 18:10.841
HE'S A GOOD ONE.

18:11.008 --> 18:12.259
MY PA HAD TO
GO INTO TOWN,

18:12.426 --> 18:13.719
SO I HAD SOME
EXTRA CHORES TO DO.

18:13.886 --> 18:14.887
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

18:15.053 --> 18:17.097
GAVE ME TIME TO FIND
SOME FAT GRUBS.

18:17.264 --> 18:19.475
YEAH, I GUESS.

18:19.641 --> 18:21.977
UM...MARY DIDN'T
WAIT, HUH?

18:22.144 --> 18:23.729
NO. SHE'D
RATHER STAY HOME

18:23.896 --> 18:26.231
WITH HER NOSE IN ONE
OF HER SCHOOLBOOKS.

18:26.398 --> 18:27.858
OHH...

18:28.025 --> 18:30.235
YOU KNOW, I RECKON THAT'S
WHY SHE'S SO SMART.

18:30.402 --> 18:31.862
YOU KNOW, I BET SHE'LL WIN
THAT GOLD MEDAL

18:32.029 --> 18:33.697
FOR THE BEST STUDENT,
DON'T YOU THINK?

18:33.864 --> 18:35.032
NOW, IF WE DON'T
GET STARTED,

18:35.199 --> 18:36.658
WE WON'T EVEN
GET A BITE.

18:39.828 --> 18:41.663
HEY, YOU GOT ONE!

18:41.830 --> 18:44.249
GOLLY, MOSES, LAURA!

18:44.416 --> 18:46.084
THAT'S THE BIGGEST ONE YET!

18:46.251 --> 18:47.586
BOY!

18:47.753 --> 18:48.754
HEY, THAT WAS
REALLY SMART,

18:48.921 --> 18:50.088
THE WAY YOU LET HIM
SWALLOW UP YOUR BAIT

18:50.255 --> 18:52.716
RATHER THAN YANKING
ON HIM REALLY QUICK.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.804
YEAH. HE'S A BIG'UN!

19:00.057 --> 19:01.683
BOY, LAURA, YOU KNOW,
YOU AIN'T NOTHING

19:01.850 --> 19:04.478
LIKE THE OTHER GIRLS.

19:04.645 --> 19:05.938
I'M NOT?

19:06.104 --> 19:08.649
NO! YOU'RE--
YOU'RE DIFFERENT.

19:08.816 --> 19:11.276
YOU REALLY THINK SO,
JOHNNY?

19:11.443 --> 19:12.861
SURE, I DO.

19:13.028 --> 19:15.280
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW ANY
OTHER GIRL IN THE WHOLE SCHOOL

19:15.447 --> 19:18.158
WHO CAN PUT A WIGGLY WORM
ON THE HOOK THE WAY YOU DO.

19:41.139 --> 19:43.058
WHAT A PRETTY SONG--

19:43.225 --> 19:46.228
SQUIRRELS PLAYING
AND FISH JUMPING.

19:46.395 --> 19:49.648
THIS IS SUCH
A CHEERFUL PLACE.

19:49.815 --> 19:50.983
AT TIMES LIKE THIS,

19:51.149 --> 19:53.735
I FEEL ALL WARM
AND SPARKY INSIDE.

19:53.902 --> 19:56.446
YOU EVER FEEL
THAT WAY, JOHNNY?

20:14.715 --> 20:16.842
HEY. IT SURE WAS
GOOD FISHING.

20:17.009 --> 20:18.343
IT WAS GOOD LUNCH, TOO.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.679
HEY. YOU GOT ANY MORE OF THEM
FINE OATMEAL COOKIES LEFT?

20:20.846 --> 20:22.347
YOU ATE THEM ALL.

20:22.514 --> 20:24.933
OH. WELL, HERE'S
YOUR CATCH, LAURA.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.268
YOU WANT SOME
OF MINE?

20:26.435 --> 20:28.061
OH, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S JUST MY PA AND ME.

20:28.228 --> 20:29.855
I THINK THIS IS FINE.

20:30.022 --> 20:32.566
WELL, I GOT TO BE GOING.

20:32.733 --> 20:35.277
BYE-BYE, JACK.

20:35.444 --> 20:37.863
OH. HEY, LAURA.

20:38.030 --> 20:39.615
WILL YOU DO ME
A FAVOR?

20:39.781 --> 20:41.116
SURE!

20:41.283 --> 20:43.076
WILL YOU TELL MARY THAT
IF THAT HARRY BAKER

20:43.243 --> 20:45.245
KEEPS ON PESTERING HER
THAT I'LL BE GLAD

20:45.412 --> 20:46.747
TO TEACH HIM SOME
MANNERS, ALL RIGHT?

20:46.914 --> 20:49.041
WELL, HARRY PESTERS
ALL THE GIRLS.

20:49.207 --> 20:51.668
HE PESTERS ME, TOO!

20:51.835 --> 20:53.503
WELL, YOU OUGHT TO CUFF
HIM ONE ON THE EAR THEN.

20:53.670 --> 20:55.088
I'LL SEE YOU.

20:58.050 --> 21:00.594
JACK, YOU COME BACK HERE!

21:10.020 --> 21:12.064
Laura, voice-over:
IT WAS A ROTTEN PICNIC,

21:12.230 --> 21:15.400
NOT LIKE MA FINDING OUT
SHE AND PA WERE KINDRED SPIRITS

21:15.567 --> 21:17.819
WHO COULD READ
EACH OTHER'S THOUGHTS.

21:17.986 --> 21:19.488
ALL THAT I LEARNED
ABOUT JOHNNY WAS

21:19.655 --> 21:22.157
THAT HE COULD EAT A LOT
OF OATMEAL COOKIES.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.745
MA SAID YOU COULD TELL
EACH OTHER'S THOUGHTS.

21:26.912 --> 21:28.956
WELL, AS MUCH
AS ANY MAN CAN READ

21:29.122 --> 21:32.250
ANY WOMAN'S
THOUGHTS, I GUESS.

21:32.417 --> 21:35.504
CAN I ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS
ABOUT WHAT MEN THINK?

21:35.671 --> 21:37.005
MM-HMM. WHY NOT?

21:37.172 --> 21:40.926
MA'S SMART. DO MEN LIKE
SMART GIRLS THE BEST?

21:41.093 --> 21:42.511
UH, SOME DO.

21:42.678 --> 21:44.638
SOME LIKE THEM
SWEET AND GENTLE.

21:44.805 --> 21:46.556
SOME LIKE THEM
FULL OF VINEGAR.

21:46.723 --> 21:49.434
YOUR MA'S KIND OF ALL THOSE
THINGS ROLLED INTO ONE.

21:49.601 --> 21:51.436
WHAT DID YOU LIKE
BEST ABOUT MA?

21:51.603 --> 21:54.398
WELL, I THINK WHAT
I LIKED BEST ABOUT HER

21:54.564 --> 21:55.774
WAS SHE KNEW WHEN TO BE
QUIET AND NOT ASK A BUNCH

21:55.941 --> 21:58.735
OF SILLY QUESTIONS
WHILE A MAN WAS WORKING.

21:58.902 --> 22:00.570
JUST ONE MORE, PA.

22:00.737 --> 22:03.281
ALL RIGHT. ONE MORE.

22:03.448 --> 22:06.535
DID YOU LIKE ANY OTHER GIRLS
BEFORE YOU LIKED MA?

22:08.328 --> 22:12.332
DID YOU EVER PUT YOURS AND HER
INITIALS ON A SWEETHEART TREE?

22:12.499 --> 22:14.751
WELL, THAT'S 2
QUESTIONS, HALF-PINT.

22:14.918 --> 22:16.670
AS FOR THE INITIALING,

22:16.837 --> 22:17.963
I DON'T THINK I DID,
ALTHOUGH I WOULD HAVE

22:18.130 --> 22:19.631
IF I WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT OF IT.

22:19.798 --> 22:21.842
AS FOR WHETHER I LIKED
ANY OTHER GIRLS,

22:22.009 --> 22:24.469
I WOULDN'T ANSWER THAT
QUESTION FOR YOU OR YOUR MA.

22:24.636 --> 22:25.762
NOW, RUN ALONG,

22:25.929 --> 22:27.848
LET ME FINISH
CARRIE'S HIGHCHAIR, HUH?

22:38.650 --> 22:39.985
HAS LAURA
BEEN ASKING YOU

22:40.152 --> 22:42.029
SOME FUNNY QUESTIONS
LATELY?

22:42.195 --> 22:45.073
SHE ASKED ME HOW WE MET,

22:45.240 --> 22:46.408
ABOUT OUR COURTSHIP.

22:46.575 --> 22:47.868
WELL, I'LL BE DARNED.

22:48.035 --> 22:49.202
WHEN I WAS OUT
BY THE BARN WORKING,

22:49.369 --> 22:50.746
SHE WAS ASKING ME
THE SAME KIND OF THING--

22:50.912 --> 22:52.664
WHAT MEN LIKE
ABOUT WOMEN.

22:52.831 --> 22:55.667
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

22:55.834 --> 22:58.336
DON'T SUPPOSE SHE'S GOT A LITTLE
CASE OF PUPPY LOVE, DO YOU?

22:58.503 --> 23:02.507
- LAURA?
- MM-HMM.

23:02.674 --> 23:04.217
WELL, CHARLES...

23:04.384 --> 23:06.553
I CAN REMEMBER
CHASING SOMEBODY

23:06.720 --> 23:10.015
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER
THAN LAURA IS.

23:10.182 --> 23:12.392
I EVEN REMEMBER SLOWING
DOWN SO YOU COULD CATCH ME.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.311
HA HA!

23:26.323 --> 23:27.240
YOU KNOW...

23:27.407 --> 23:28.575
I THOUGHT WHAT
REVEREND ALDEN SAID

23:28.742 --> 23:30.702
ABOUT THE MISSIONS
IN CHINA WAS INTERESTING.

23:30.869 --> 23:33.038
I HOPE HE TELLS US MORE
NEXT SUNDAY.

23:33.205 --> 23:34.915
WHAT DID YOU
THINK, LAURA?

23:35.082 --> 23:37.542
I THOUGHT THE SERMON
WAS TOO LONG.

23:37.709 --> 23:39.377
WELL...WHY?

23:39.544 --> 23:42.089
BECAUSE MY LEGS
WENT TO SLEEP.

23:51.306 --> 23:52.974
HEY, HALF-PINT.

23:53.141 --> 23:54.559
IF I HAVE THIS
FISH TRAP FINISHED

23:54.726 --> 23:56.061
BY THE TIME YOU GET
DONE COLLECTING EGGS,

23:56.228 --> 23:57.521
YOU CAN HELP ME
PUT IT IN THE CREEK.

23:57.687 --> 23:59.439
OK, PA.

24:02.526 --> 24:05.362
IT'S JOHNNY JOHNSON!

24:10.909 --> 24:12.202
LAURA...

24:12.369 --> 24:13.995
CARRIE'S ASLEEP.

24:50.323 --> 24:52.617
WELL, IF IT ISN'T
JOHNNY JOHNSON.

24:52.784 --> 24:54.619
HEY, I WAS JUST
TELLING YOUR PA HERE

24:54.786 --> 24:56.329
HE DON'T NEED TO WORK
ON THAT FISH TRAP

24:56.496 --> 24:59.291
THE WAY YOU
CATCH FISH, LAURA.

24:59.457 --> 25:03.170
WANT TO HELP US SET IT
UP AT THE FALLS, JOHNNY?

25:03.336 --> 25:05.130
WELL, HEY,
I'D SURE LIKE TO.

25:05.297 --> 25:06.506
GOOD.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.550
ONLY I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN.

25:08.717 --> 25:09.759
WHY NOT?

25:09.926 --> 25:11.303
WELL...

25:11.469 --> 25:14.139
YOU SEE, I CAME HERE
TO ASK A FAVOR.

25:14.306 --> 25:15.640
WHAT KIND OF FAVOR?

25:15.807 --> 25:17.309
WELL...

25:17.475 --> 25:19.811
YOU SEE, I'M GETTING
REALLY BEHIND

25:19.978 --> 25:21.646
IN THESE READING
WORDS, YOU KNOW?

25:21.813 --> 25:24.274
AND THAT MAKES
THE HOMEWORK AWFULLY HARD.

25:24.441 --> 25:28.361
SO I WAS FIGURING ON MAYBE
ASKING MARY TO HELP SOME.

25:28.528 --> 25:31.656
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, HER WANTING
TO BE A TEACHER AND ALL,

25:31.823 --> 25:34.326
MAYBE SHE
WOULDN'T MIND.

25:34.492 --> 25:35.911
IF IT'S ALL RIGHT,
THAT IS.

25:36.077 --> 25:37.829
IT'S FINE WITH ME.

25:37.996 --> 25:39.497
YOU DON'T THINK
SHE'D MIND?

25:39.664 --> 25:42.209
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, TAKING HER
AWAY FROM HER STUDYING AND ALL.

25:42.375 --> 25:44.169
ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

25:44.336 --> 25:46.004
GO ON TO THE HOUSE
AND ASK HER.

25:46.171 --> 25:48.965
YES, SIR.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

25:49.132 --> 25:50.759
A NICE BOY.

25:50.926 --> 25:53.720
WHY DON'T YOU CUT ME SOME
MORE LENGTHS OF STRING, HUH?

25:53.887 --> 25:56.056
GOT TO COLLECT
THE EGGS.

25:59.601 --> 26:02.145
Johnny: HEY, MARY.

26:02.312 --> 26:04.564
MARY!

26:05.607 --> 26:06.691
OH, HI, JOHNNY.

26:06.858 --> 26:08.526
HI. MARY,
I WAS WONDERING

26:08.693 --> 26:10.862
IF YOU'D HELP ME WITH
MY READING WORDS A LITTLE BIT.

26:11.029 --> 26:13.031
SURE. COME ON IN.

26:13.198 --> 26:14.532
I'D APPRECIATE IT.

26:21.748 --> 26:23.458
MIND THE MUSH,
PLEASE, MARY.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.043
MUSH MEAT, MARY.

26:25.210 --> 26:26.211
YES, MA.

26:26.378 --> 26:28.088
- MA?
- MM-HMM?

26:28.255 --> 26:30.423
CAN I WEAR MY BLUE SUNDAY
RIBBONS TO SCHOOL TODAY?

26:30.590 --> 26:32.425
PLEASE, MAY I.

26:32.592 --> 26:33.927
PLEASE, MAY I?

26:34.094 --> 26:36.137
PROVIDED YOU REMEMBER TO
WEAR THEM HOME AGAIN.

26:36.304 --> 26:38.223
I WILL.

26:43.812 --> 26:44.854
MORNING.

26:45.021 --> 26:46.564
MORNING, PA.

26:47.565 --> 26:48.775
Charles: MORNING,
HALF-PINT.

DO YOU FIGURE ARE ON IT?

40:57.164 --> 40:59.250
OH...

40:59.416 --> 41:01.752
LOOKS LIKE
A WHOLE MESS.

41:03.087 --> 41:05.422
SOME BOYS DO IT
IN SECRET.

41:09.135 --> 41:12.847
WELL, I RECKON IT'S
BECAUSE THEY'RE SCARED.

41:13.013 --> 41:14.849
BUT YOU'RE NOT SCARED.

41:15.015 --> 41:17.434
YOU ASKED ME RIGHT OUT
TO MEET YOU HERE.

41:17.601 --> 41:20.396
YEAH.

41:20.563 --> 41:21.981
WELL...

41:22.148 --> 41:24.316
YOU'RE DIFFERENT, LAURA.

41:24.483 --> 41:26.110
I KNOW.

41:26.277 --> 41:28.988
I'M A PRETTY GOOD
RUNNER FOR A GIRL.

41:29.155 --> 41:32.408
I'M NOT FUSSY ABOUT PUTTING
WIGGLY OLD WORMS ON HOOKS.

41:32.575 --> 41:37.204
NO. IT'S...
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

41:37.371 --> 41:39.456
YOU SEEM...

41:39.623 --> 41:46.463
WELL, A FELLA CAN--
CAN SAY THINGS TO YOU THAT...

41:46.630 --> 41:49.091
WELL, HE'D BE KIND
OF EMBARRASSED

41:49.258 --> 41:53.637
TO SAY TO SOMEBODY ELSE,
YOU KNOW?

41:53.804 --> 41:57.016
YOU SEEM TO UNDERSTAND
THE WAY I FEEL.

41:59.602 --> 42:01.896
KINDRED SPIRITS.

42:04.315 --> 42:07.234
SHOW ME WHAT YOU CARVED,
JOHNNY. PLEASE?

42:09.653 --> 42:11.739
ALL RIGHT.

42:15.075 --> 42:17.077
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

42:20.080 --> 42:21.874
I FIGURED YOU COULD TELL ME,

42:22.041 --> 42:25.669
YOU BEING SO CLOSE
TO HER AND ALL.

42:25.836 --> 42:28.088
HOW DO YOU THINK
SHE'LL LIKE IT?

42:30.507 --> 42:32.593
LAURA!

43:13.050 --> 43:16.971
CAROLINE, YOU SURE HAVE A WAY
WITH BUFFALOFISH.

43:17.137 --> 43:18.389
NEVER DID UNDERSTAND
WHERE THEY GOT SO MANY

43:18.555 --> 43:20.099
FUNNY NAMES FOR FISH--

43:20.266 --> 43:24.186
BUFFALOFISH, CATFISH...

43:24.353 --> 43:25.980
EVEN BUTTERFISH.

43:30.734 --> 43:32.569
WELL, I CAN TELL YOU WHERE
THEY GOT THE NAME BULLHEAD.

43:32.736 --> 43:35.572
NOW, THAT'S THE STUBBORNEST FISH
I EVER DID TRY TO CATCH.

43:35.739 --> 43:37.199
Caroline: HEH.

43:39.743 --> 43:41.578
HOW WAS SCHOOL TODAY?

43:41.745 --> 43:43.580
IT WAS FINE, PA.

43:43.747 --> 43:44.832
Mary: NOT FOR ME.

43:44.999 --> 43:46.250
I'LL BE THE LAUGHINGSTOCK

43:46.417 --> 43:48.002
OF EVERY GIRL
IN SCHOOL TOMORROW,

43:48.168 --> 43:50.754
ALL BECAUSE OF THAT NUMSKULL
JOHNNY JOHNSON.

43:50.921 --> 43:52.506
Caroline: WHAT ON EARTH?

43:52.673 --> 43:54.341
WHY, HE SEEMED
LIKE SUCH A NICE LAD.

43:54.508 --> 43:57.594
HE SNEAKED OFF AND PUT MY NAME
ON THE SWEETHEART TREE

43:57.761 --> 43:59.763
FOR EVERYBODY
TO GAPE AT.

43:59.930 --> 44:01.140
"JOHNNY LOVES MARY."

44:01.307 --> 44:03.559
AND I DON'T
EVEN LIKE HIM!

44:03.726 --> 44:05.477
WILLIE'S RIGHT.

44:05.644 --> 44:07.313
HE LOOKS
LIKE A SCARECROW,

44:07.479 --> 44:10.441
AND HE'S ADDLEBRAINED, AS WELL.

44:10.607 --> 44:13.527
HOW COULD YOU
BE SO MEAN?

44:13.694 --> 44:16.030
HE'S THE BEST RUNNER AND
ROPER IN THE WHOLE SCHOOL!

44:16.196 --> 44:18.198
YOU'RE THE NUMSKULL!

44:20.784 --> 44:22.369
[DOOR SLAMS]

44:27.666 --> 44:29.668
WHY DON'T YOU
LET ME GO?

44:29.835 --> 44:30.919
SOMETIMES WHEN
YOU LOSE ONE MAN,

44:31.086 --> 44:32.880
IT HELPS TO TALK
TO ANOTHER ONE.

45:42.408 --> 45:44.201
IT'S NOT FAIR, PA.

45:44.368 --> 45:46.870
SHE DOESN'T CARE
A HOOT ABOUT HIM,

45:47.037 --> 45:50.958
AND IT'S HER NAME
HE PUT ON THE TREE.

45:51.125 --> 45:52.459
I COULD HAVE DIED.

45:52.626 --> 45:53.877
IT WAS THE MOST
TRAGICAL THING

45:54.044 --> 45:56.255
THAT EVER HAPPENED
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

45:58.465 --> 46:02.469
KIND OF LIKE THAT TIME WE
LOST THAT OLD DOG JACK, HUH?

46:02.636 --> 46:05.055
JACK FOUND US AGAIN.

46:05.222 --> 46:08.016
AND JOHNNY WILL
FIND YOU AGAIN.

46:08.183 --> 46:09.977
YOU THINK HE WILL?

46:10.144 --> 46:11.562
WHY, SURE, HE WILL.

46:11.728 --> 46:13.772
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER
WHEN I WAS A BOY,

46:13.939 --> 46:16.275
I KNEW THIS LITTLE GAL.

46:16.442 --> 46:18.861
SHE HAD PIGTAILS
AND FRECKLES.

46:19.027 --> 46:20.529
SHE WAS ABOUT
4 YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME,

46:20.696 --> 46:23.157
WHICH IS LIKE A HUNDRED
WHEN YOU'RE 15.

46:23.323 --> 46:24.533
JOHNNY'S 15.

46:24.700 --> 46:26.076
YEAH.

46:26.243 --> 46:27.578
I USED TO CALL HER
"TAGALONG"

46:27.744 --> 46:30.497
BECAUSE SHE WAS ALWAYS CHASING
AFTER ME ALL THE TIME.

46:30.664 --> 46:32.291
I DIDN'T PAY HER
ANY MIND.

46:32.458 --> 46:33.917
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
ONE DAY,

46:34.084 --> 46:36.920
I NOTICED A WHOLE BUNCH OF
BOYS BUZZING AROUND HER

46:37.087 --> 46:38.839
LIKE BEES TO HONEY.

46:39.006 --> 46:40.340
I TOOK A GOOD LOOK
AT HER,

46:40.507 --> 46:42.801
AND I REALIZED
THAT SHE HAD BLOSSOMED

46:42.968 --> 46:45.929
INTO ABOUT THE PRETTIEST
THING I'D EVER SEEN.

46:46.096 --> 46:47.264
I FIGURED SHE'D
TAKE TO ME RIGHT OFF

46:47.431 --> 46:50.767
BUT SHE COULDN'T
SEE ME FOR DUST.

46:50.934 --> 46:52.269
HER NAME WAS CAROLINE.

46:52.436 --> 46:53.896
MA?

46:55.772 --> 46:57.149
MA.

46:59.735 --> 47:01.695
AND YOU'RE
JUST LIKE HER.

47:03.113 --> 47:04.740
JUST LIKE HER.

47:06.200 --> 47:07.576
YOU WAIT AND SEE.

47:07.743 --> 47:09.411
ONE OF THESE DAYS YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE LOTS OF BEAUS.

47:09.578 --> 47:10.829
I WOULDN'T
BE SURPRISED

47:10.996 --> 47:12.664
IF JOHNNY JOHNSON'S ONE
OF THEM, SWEET THING.

47:12.831 --> 47:15.626
I'M NOT
A SWEET THING, PA.

47:15.792 --> 47:17.044
I BLAMED IT ALL ON MARY,

47:17.211 --> 47:19.338
AND IT WASN'T
EVEN HER FAULT.

47:19.505 --> 47:23.592
I SAID WICKED THINGS
TO HER ON PURPOSE.

47:23.759 --> 47:26.053
I MEANT TO BE HURTFUL,

47:26.220 --> 47:29.681
BUT IT DIDN'T STOP
MY HURTING.

47:29.848 --> 47:31.642
WELL, YOU LEARNED
A LESSON.

47:31.808 --> 47:33.810
HURTING BACK
DOESN'T HELP.

47:33.977 --> 47:36.396
THERE'S LOT OF WAYS
TO MAKE AMENDS.

47:38.106 --> 47:40.067
I GUESS I WAS JEALOUS.

47:41.401 --> 47:43.195
OH, SO WAS I.

47:43.362 --> 47:44.488
YOU, PA?

47:44.655 --> 47:46.782
MM-HMM.

47:46.949 --> 47:48.200
SOME YOUNG SPROUT

47:48.367 --> 47:50.327
WAS TRYING TO STEAL
MY BEST GIRL.

47:50.494 --> 47:52.246
OH, PA!

47:55.666 --> 47:57.918
I LOVE YOU.

48:00.170 --> 48:02.089
NOW...

48:02.256 --> 48:04.007
IF YOU'RE GOING TO GROW UP
TO BE AS PRETTY AS YOUR MA,

48:04.174 --> 48:05.259
I THINK WE OUGHT
TO GET YOU HOME

48:05.425 --> 48:06.552
AND GIVE YOU
SOME SUPPER.

48:06.718 --> 48:09.596
HA HA!
