to share the $60,000,

14:36.959 --> 14:40.170
we should each put up
some money of our own
to show good faith...

14:40.170 --> 14:43.173
-while he checked on
if the other was counterfeit.
-You weren't suspicious?

14:43.173 --> 14:45.968
This had to be cash?
What does that even mean,
"show good faith"?

14:45.968 --> 14:48.762
I can't explain.
That wasn't money
you could afford to lose.

people's trust.

14:51.557 --> 14:54.768
They've probably
run the same scam
a hundred times.

14:54.768 --> 14:58.355
Don't feel ashamed
you were victimized.
What happened next, ma'am?

14:58.355 --> 15:02.902
The woman took
$5,000 from her bank,
or so I thought.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.195
And then I withdrew mine.

15:05.195 --> 15:08.157
Her taking her money out
first, that was part of
gaining your confidence.

15:08.157 --> 15:11.785
And then the black girl
said she needed
a ride to her bank,

15:11.785 --> 15:15.623
but with my wheelchair,
I should wait
at this coffee shop.

15:15.623 --> 15:21.420
I was given this zippered bag
to hold onto in the meantime
with the $60,000.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.422
Which was really
chopped up newspaper.

15:23.422 --> 15:28.761
Oh, as soon as I got in the car,
I knew I'd made a terrible,
terrible mistake.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.972
I'm gonna do my best
to catch the people
who did this to you.

15:31.972 --> 15:35.517
(sighs)
What are we supposed
to do now, Sis, huh?

15:35.517 --> 15:38.228
How can I have peace of mind,
you living independent
by yourself,

15:38.228 --> 15:40.147
if you let this happen?

15:42.983 --> 15:46.445
Hey, Lombardi.
What's doing?
Yeah, I'm good.

15:46.445 --> 15:51.283
Listen, uh, Eddie Hazel,
he came by the house
this morning. Uh--

15:51.283 --> 15:53.619
He's working
on some bar stickups?

15:53.619 --> 15:57.331
Yeah, he gave me
a phone number on a witness
from Hondo's Bar.

15:57.331 --> 16:00.042
And, uh,
I don't know, man.

16:00.042 --> 16:04.046
I must have wrote down
the number wrong here,
because--What?

16:04.046 --> 16:06.465
Really?

16:06.465 --> 16:11.512
Ah, oh, could you
do me a favor then,
and check the 61?

16:11.512 --> 16:13.889
Yeah, the guy's name
is McGregor. Psst.

16:13.889 --> 16:16.517
-Thanks.
-What's going on?

16:16.517 --> 16:20.479
Some detective from Midtown
South came over this morning,
looking to swap information.

16:20.479 --> 16:23.357
So, there's a mix-up
on this phone number of
a witness that he gave me.

16:23.357 --> 16:26.402
Lombardi's saying,
"I'm surprised this jerk would
even give a phone number to"--

16:26.402 --> 16:29.196
Hello. Yeah.

16:29.196 --> 16:33.534
Mm-hmm. 2739.

16:33.534 --> 16:36.078
Right.
What about the home address?
Is that on there?

16:37.413 --> 16:39.248
Uh-huh.

16:39.248 --> 16:43.711
So, what you were saying
before about this guy Hazel,
what's the deal with him?

16:43.711 --> 16:47.172
Yeah, huh?
(whispers)
Asshole.

16:47.172 --> 16:50.509
Yeah.
All right. Thanks.
Thanks for saying it.

16:50.509 --> 16:54.513
-Yeah, take care.
-What'd he say?

16:54.513 --> 16:57.307
This Eddie Hazel,
he's pissed off half the squad
over there already.

16:57.307 --> 16:59.643
He's an ex-Transit cop
looking to set the world
on fire.

16:59.643 --> 17:02.021
He's stealing collars
from his own guys.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.897
Think him giving you
the wrong number's
on purpose?

17:03.897 --> 17:07.526
Lombardi said that.
Said that's the kind
of silly crap that he's doing.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.611
-You got the legit number
and address there?
-Yeah.

17:09.611 --> 17:12.906
Bartender at a place
got hit a few hours before
this Mott Street tavern.

17:12.906 --> 17:17.661

Yeah, good morning.
I wanted to talk to you
about the incident last night.

17:37.931 --> 17:40.142
The incident?

17:40.142 --> 17:43.562
I'm curious what was
going through your mind,

17:43.562 --> 17:47.149
deciding a busted taillight
warranted me and my wife...

17:47.149 --> 17:49.943
being treated like,
uh, Bonnie and Clyde.

17:49.943 --> 17:53.947
Lieutenant, I regret
whatever the inconvenience
to your wife or yourself,

17:53.947 --> 17:55.783
but we got to protect
ourselves out there.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.951
You wouldn't be here
if I thought it was
about protecting yourself.

17:57.951 --> 18:01.789
I can't help what you think.
Until I have control
of a situation out there,

18:01.789 --> 18:03.665
how am I supposed to know
what I'm dealing with?

18:04.458 --> 18:06.585
Do you feel the situation
was handled appropriately?

18:06.585 --> 18:09.588
It's me who pulled
you over, sir. It's me
you got the beef with.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.382
Officer McCaslin
can't speak for himself?

18:12.382 --> 18:13.967
How about it?

18:13.967 --> 18:18.180
Well, police have gotten shot
during car stops. We need to
protect ourselves.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.974
-How long you been
on the street?
-Ten months.

18:20.974 --> 18:23.185
-You?
-Six and a half years.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.604
-Queens the whole time?
-So what?

18:25.604 --> 18:28.398
So what did you perceive
as so threatening
about me...

18:28.398 --> 18:31.068
that you reacted
to the degree that you did?

18:33.403 --> 18:34.988
Color of my skin?

18:34.988 --> 18:38.617
I knew. I knew you
were gonna make this
a black-and-white thing.

18:38.617 --> 18:43.413
You tell me one thing
I said out there to disparage
you or your wife racially.

18:43.413 --> 18:46.208
The minute you pulled us over,
you didn't treat us
like two people.

18:46.208 --> 18:49.628
-You treated us like
two black people.
-Uh-uh, no sale.

18:49.628 --> 18:52.005
Shut up.
And when you found
I was a lieutenant,

18:52.005 --> 18:54.091
you talked to me
like a black lieutenant.

18:54.091 --> 18:59.221

Detective Simone.
This is Detective Sipowicz,
with the 15th Precinct.

I spoke at length
with a black detective
over at Hondo's.

20:04.494 --> 20:06.914
Yeah, he said
you were very helpful
with the description.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.917
We think that the
same two men held up
another bar after Hondo's,

20:09.917 --> 20:11.752
and, uh,
we'd like your help.

Tryin' to get the stickup team.
Why don't you tell
us what went down?

20:28.101 --> 20:30.312
Like I told
the black detective,
these two guys come in,

20:30.312 --> 20:34.149
they sit at the bar, they order
a couple of drinks, which they
nurse for half an hour.

20:34.149 --> 20:37.861
When the ball game's over,
one of them pulls out
this pocket-size pistol.

20:37.861 --> 20:41.740
.25, matte nickel finish.
They demand the money.
I give it up. They split.

20:41.740 --> 20:44.326
-There's something
you're not telling us.
-What?

20:44.326 --> 20:46.787
What's with this shoulder rig?
You got a carry permit?

20:46.787 --> 20:49.539
-No.
-No, you just collect holsters?

20:49.539 --> 20:52.292
Where's the gun
fits in this rig, hmm?

20:52.292 --> 20:54.753
Behind the bar maybe,
where it might do some good?

uh, what, a .45 at the bar,

21:00.467 --> 21:02.761
why do you let these thieves
walk through the door?

21:02.761 --> 21:06.556
-See how it don't make sense?
-So, if we start taking this
place apart, Mr. McGregor,

21:06.556 --> 21:09.351
-are we gonna find
any illegal firearms here?
-What do you want from me?

21:09.351 --> 21:11.728
-The truth. Did you have
a gun at that bar?
-Yeah.

21:11.728 --> 21:13.647
You use it to defend
against this holdup?

21:15.357 --> 21:18.777
-They took it.
-The stickup guys
took your gun?

21:18.777 --> 21:21.488
-How did that happen?
-I froze up, all right.

21:21.488 --> 21:23.949
That .25 in my face.

The other guy
comes around the bar to take
the money out of my hands,

21:26.576 --> 21:28.996
sees I have a Colt 1911
down there.

21:28.996 --> 21:33.333
-Takes the gun away from me.
-You tell the other detective
this? The black detective?

21:33.333 --> 21:35.419
-No.
-No, you didn't?

21:37.170 --> 21:40.465
So, they're out there now
with a .45 automatic.

21:47.389 --> 21:50.809
The minute she says
I'm supposed to take money
from my bank account...

21:50.809 --> 21:54.563
-to show good faith,
I walked away.
-It's good you did that.

21:54.563 --> 21:58.066
These swindlers
oughta be stopped.
They're brazen.

21:58.066 --> 22:00.193
Well, given
they didn't succeed
in cheating you,

22:00.193 --> 22:02.195
it'll be a tough case
to do anything with.

Excuse me, Diane. Ma'am,
are you talking about a black
and white team, two females?

22:06.825 --> 22:09.578
Show a zippered bagful

22:09.578 --> 22:11.830
This is
Detective Martinez, ma'am.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.957
Oh. Yeah, it's
a black-and-white team.

22:13.957 --> 22:16.835
And the black girl
had some kind of accent.

22:16.835 --> 22:20.213
-Jamaican. I don't know what.
-You can identify these women?

22:20.213 --> 22:22.966

at them both.

22:22.966 --> 22:24.843

22:32.225 --> 22:34.853
Yeah, I had a complaint
this morning,
handicapped lady.

22:34.853 --> 22:37.230
Gave up five grand
to these scammers
a week ago.

22:37.230 --> 22:39.441
That woman couldn't
pick out their photo.

22:39.441 --> 22:41.860
Well, I can show
Mrs. Klein some mug books,

22:41.860 --> 22:44.654
and if she picks somebody out,
you can show your complainant
a photo array.

22:44.654 --> 22:47.657
I also want to talk
to the boss about a sting,
catch 'em in the act.

22:47.657 --> 22:50.452
-Mm-hmm.
-Maybe put you out
as a mark.

22:50.452 --> 22:53.622
-Would you be interested
in something like that?
-Think I can pass for 65?

22:53.622 --> 22:56.249
I was thinking, well,
you could, you know,
play like you're crippled,

22:56.249 --> 22:58.668
-roll around in a wheelchair.
-Talk to the boss.

22:58.668 --> 23:00.670
-But I can say you're
interested, right?
-Sure, James.

23:00.670 --> 23:02.589

23:02.589 --> 23:04.466
-Would you come

-Yeah.

Hey, Greg, you up for
a little overtime tonight?

23:10.722 --> 23:12.808
We're gonna set on

23:14.267 --> 23:18.647
Couple of skells
been taking bars off.
Got some new artillery.

23:18.647 --> 23:21.483
They can't be professionals.
They're leaving prints
on every glass they touch.

23:21.483 --> 23:25.904
-No hits off those, huh?
-Plus they score a loaded .45
off one bar.

23:25.904 --> 23:28.698
A few hours later
they go to rob a place
in Little Italy,

23:28.698 --> 23:31.493
they use the same pissant
.25 they've had all along.

23:31.493 --> 23:32.911
SIMONE:
Well, it could be
different next time.

23:32.911 --> 23:36.706
They broke their cherries
throwing a shot, maybe it's
gonna get good to them.

23:36.706 --> 23:40.502
-Got any sketches on them?
-Fellas, topless bar
just got hit in Midtown.

23:40.502 --> 23:42.712
There were shots fired.
Vince Gotelli's involved.

23:42.712 --> 23:45.215
-Is he hurt?
-I don't know. 38th and 7th.

23:49.302 --> 23:52.472
-What did he say, 38th and 7th?
-Yeah.

24:11.324 --> 24:15.370
-Vince, you hit?
-No, no, chest pains.

24:15.370 --> 24:17.956
-How you feeling?
-Better than I did.

24:17.956 --> 24:21.168
I think I hit one of 'em, Andy.
Two white males try to rob
the place, I intervened.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.753
-They throw shots.
-Both of 'em throwing shots?

24:23.753 --> 24:28.967
I got one of them, I think.
The one guy yelled, grabbed
his shoulder going out the door.

24:28.967 --> 24:30.760
Then I went down, chest pains.

24:30.760 --> 24:34.764
Could just be God
saying keep away
from these titty bars.

24:34.764 --> 24:36.975
I had to use a phone.
I had to get to a telephone.

24:36.975 --> 24:39.895
There you go, Vince.
Reach out and touch somebody.

24:39.895 --> 24:42.105
Take good care of him, huh?
Yeah.

24:44.816 --> 24:48.028
-Hey! (whistles)
-SIMONE: Oh, look at this.

24:49.362 --> 24:52.782
-What are you guys doing here?
-Hold on. That's Vince Gotelli
from our squad.

24:52.782 --> 24:55.368
We got word
that he was involved.
We come check on him.

24:55.368 --> 24:57.579
-Was he shot?
-Chest pains, Eddie.

24:57.579 --> 25:01.333
Well, why don't you
go keep him company,
hold his hand, huh?

25:01.333 --> 25:03.376
You know, you're
some kind of jerk.
You had me going.

25:03.376 --> 25:06.379
-What was your problem
giving me a wrong number?
-What are you talking about?

25:06.379 --> 25:09.382
Yeah, you play whatever
kind of silly games
you need to play, Eddie.

25:09.382 --> 25:13.720
Next time you give me
wrong information on a case,
me and you, we're going at it.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.684
Be good to check
the emergency rooms
in the area.

25:19.684 --> 25:22.437
Gotelli says
he might've hit one
of them in the shoulder.

25:22.437 --> 25:25.774
I'll hear
what Gotelli's got to say
when I interview Gotelli.

25:25.774 --> 25:27.984
So, this has got nothing to do
with getting these assholes
off the street...

25:27.984 --> 25:29.402

gets killed.

25:29.402 --> 25:33.865

You're pretty tight

26:02.435 --> 26:06.314
-Pretty tight. What's up?
-I got pulled over

26:06.314 --> 26:09.276
Cop breaks my balls

I'd like to see
him sent somewhere

-How'd he break your balls?
-Overreacts, number one.

26:15.490 --> 26:19.077
Orders me and Lillian
over the top of the car
for a broken taillight.

26:19.077 --> 26:22.080
I show my shield and this,
uh, meathead Szymanski...

26:22.080 --> 26:24.291
starts in

the summons anyway.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.459
So, you want him transferred?
Szymanski?

26:26.459 --> 26:28.670
Spent his whole career
in Bayside Queens.

26:28.670 --> 26:31.298
The only black people
he sees are the ones
he pulls over,

26:31.298 --> 26:33.466
wondering what the hell
they're doing
in the neighborhood.

26:33.466 --> 26:36.094
He needs to do some time
in Brooklyn North...

26:36.094 --> 26:38.888
or Harlem,
where he has to learn
to deal with everybody.

26:38.888 --> 26:41.099
Understand who's a threat
and who's not.

26:41.099 --> 26:44.894
-You sure this is how
you wanna handle it?
-I had him in here today.

26:44.894 --> 26:48.440
Gave him a chance to fix it.
All this guy wants to do
is smart-mouth.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.735
Can you handle this
for me, Captain?

26:51.735 --> 26:55.697
All right, Arthur.
I'll see what I can do.

27:02.329 --> 27:05.332
♪♪

27:16.176 --> 27:17.844
-Here.
-Thanks.

27:20.722 --> 27:22.932
Excuse me.
Can you help me?

27:22.932 --> 27:25.185
-What?
-Look.
Look at this.

27:25.185 --> 27:29.606
It's full of money.
I found it at that bus stop.

27:29.606 --> 27:32.150
There's no identification
with it?

27:32.150 --> 27:35.111
There was just this
piece of paper. I don't know
what it means though.

27:35.111 --> 27:39.074
Celtics, 60 "K."
Celtics is a basketball team.

27:39.074 --> 27:41.576
It's probably gambling money.

27:41.576 --> 27:44.371
What's the procedure
for something like this?
Can I get in trouble?

27:44.371 --> 27:46.790
Excuse me, miss.
Is everything all right?

27:46.790 --> 27:49.084
Yeah, I was just--
I was trying to
help this woman.

27:49.084 --> 27:52.253
-I don't know what to do.
Look. I found it.
-Oh, my God!

27:52.253 --> 27:55.298
There's a note.
Um, I think
it's gambling money.

27:55.298 --> 27:57.967
She can probably
keep it, right?

27:57.967 --> 28:01.680
Listen, I will share this money
with you if you can help me find
out what to do so I can keep it.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.683
I will share it
with both of you.

28:04.683 --> 28:07.936
Uh, I mean,
I could call my boss.
He's an attorney.

28:07.936 --> 28:11.064
I have a cellular phone
you can use.

28:11.064 --> 28:13.274
-Your boss will know
what to do?
-Yes, call your boss.

28:14.567 --> 28:18.405
I mean it, I want to share
this money with you both.
You're such nice people.

28:18.405 --> 28:22.200
They went for our phone.
Get the recorder going.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.910
-MAN: Yeah.
-Hi, Mr. Bennett.

28:23.910 --> 28:27.038
-Yeah.
-Hey, it's me, Susan.

28:27.038 --> 28:30.375
I'm here on 12th Street,
and there's this woman who found
this bag full of money.

28:30.375 --> 28:34.003
And me and this other lady
were just sitting here trying to
figure out if she can keep it.

28:34.003 --> 28:36.506
You know, you've
got a gorgeous ass?

28:36.506 --> 28:40.260
-No, no I.D.
-I dreamt about your ass
last night.

28:40.260 --> 28:43.805
-Oh, great.
-He says there's a good chance
you can keep it.

28:43.805 --> 28:48.309
I can keep it!
Oh, my God, I love
this United States!

28:48.309 --> 28:52.355
-What? Oh.
-What's he saying?

28:52.355 --> 28:56.443
He says we need to make sure
the money hasn't
been reported stolen.

28:56.443 --> 28:59.654
If we bring it by his office,
he'll make the legal inquiries,

28:59.654 --> 29:02.365
-and return it to us
by tomorrow.
-I should do that?

29:02.365 --> 29:04.784
-He can make
the legal inquiries?
-Wait.

29:04.784 --> 29:06.870
I'm sorry.
I didn't hear you, Mr. Bennett.

29:06.870 --> 29:10.707
Okay. He says if we're
each going to have a right
to this money,

29:10.707 --> 29:13.585
we each need to put up
some money to establish
our legal claims.

29:13.585 --> 29:17.297
I'm willing to do it.
And my bank's
just up the street.

29:17.297 --> 29:19.758
-Would you be willing
to do that?
-Okay.

29:19.758 --> 29:23.052
I can put up $5,000,
if it means
we're gonna get 60,000.

29:23.052 --> 29:27.265
-All right.
Well, are you in?
-I guess so.

29:34.189 --> 29:38.067
Detective?
This woman has information.

29:38.067 --> 29:39.819
I know who did
those bar holdups.

29:39.819 --> 29:41.863
I know where
they're gonna be too.

29:41.863 --> 29:43.698
Right this way, miss.
Thanks, Simmons.

29:47.285 --> 29:49.996
-I'm Detective Simone.
-Carl and Donny
Von Drehle.

29:49.996 --> 29:53.291
-They'll be on a bus
to Baltimore at 2:30.
-This is Detective Sipowicz.

29:53.291 --> 29:55.668
-What's your name?
-Theresa.

29:55.668 --> 29:58.004
How do you know
that these are the guys
we're looking for?

29:58.004 --> 30:00.006
Carl lives with me,
right?

30:00.006 --> 30:03.301
His dick-brained cousin
comes to town,
got this handgun.

30:03.301 --> 30:05.887
He talks Carl into going
and sticking places up.

30:05.887 --> 30:07.722
You've been around them
talking about this?

30:07.722 --> 30:09.933
They gotta get
half-drunk beforehand
to even work the nerve up.

30:09.933 --> 30:12.268
And I'm like,
"You guys are not
cut out for this."

30:12.268 --> 30:14.979
Which one of them
give you the black eye?

30:14.979 --> 30:19.108
Yesterday, they come in,
Donny's shot, crying,
bleedin' on the furniture.

30:19.108 --> 30:22.153
I'm like, "That's it."
But Carl's got this big gun
they stole, right?

30:22.153 --> 30:27.200
No, he's a big deal now.
Gonna punch me in the face
in my apartment?

30:29.285 --> 30:32.497
-Which one is this?
-Oh, that's Donny.

30:32.497 --> 30:35.083
-That's the idiot.
-You got a picture
of the other one?

30:35.083 --> 30:37.961
No, but I'm telling you,
2:30 bus to Baltimore.

30:37.961 --> 30:42.423
That's the master plan
they came up with.

30:42.423 --> 30:46.219
-You expecting?
-Man, oh, man.

30:47.178 --> 30:49.764
-Port Authority Bus Terminal?
-Yeah.

30:49.764 --> 30:52.016
Theresa,
we're gonna need you
to write your full name,

30:52.016 --> 30:54.269
your address
and your phone number
down here.

30:58.147 --> 31:01.401
-You ready to take these guys?
-Bus terminal's Midtown South.

31:01.401 --> 31:04.654
Think we oughta
call up Eddie Hazel,
let him have this collar.

31:07.574 --> 31:11.369
Thanks for coming in, huh.
Harold, can you make sure
Theresa gets out okay.

31:23.339 --> 31:25.758
So, you got
some kind of clout, huh?

31:25.758 --> 31:28.761
You get me transferred to
Bed-Stuy, which is a toilet.

31:28.761 --> 31:30.179
You got business here,
Szymanski?

31:30.179 --> 31:33.391
You turned my life upside down
'cause you think I'm a bigot.

31:35.226 --> 31:37.186
I should take my best shot,

31:37.186 --> 31:39.856
'cause you didn't get my best
out there on Bell Boulevard.

31:39.856 --> 31:42.775
Go ahead, speak your mind.

31:42.775 --> 31:45.695
What, you got
the place wired up? Huh?

31:45.695 --> 31:48.281
I say the words I want,
you get me kicked off
the job altogether?

31:48.281 --> 31:50.617
You were in the wrong,
Lieutenant?

31:53.536 --> 31:55.371
Why are you doing
this to me?

31:56.414 --> 31:59.709
It's like you said,
you pull somebody
over out there,

31:59.709 --> 32:01.669
no telling who
you're dealing with.

32:20.313 --> 32:21.814
Everybody, excuse us.

32:21.814 --> 32:25.026
We're looking for
a missing girl. We're police.
We need your help.

32:25.026 --> 32:28.821
We're gonna be coming up the
aisle showing you this picture.
Tell us if you've seen her.

32:28.821 --> 32:31.449
-Ma'am,
do you recognize this girl?
-Mm-mmm.

32:31.449 --> 32:34.577
-Sir, excuse me.
Does she look familiar to you?
-No.

32:39.832 --> 32:41.042
Ma'am, do you recognize
this girl?

32:41.042 --> 32:44.170
-How about you?
You ever seen her?
-Any of you recognize her?

32:46.422 --> 32:48.549
Either of you fellas
seen this girl?
Gentlemen?

32:48.549 --> 32:51.427
-No.
-No. Sure?

32:51.427 --> 32:54.472
-Does she look familiar to you?
-Do you recognize
this girl, sir?

32:54.472 --> 32:55.848
-Come here.
-Stay calm.

32:55.848 --> 32:57.850
Put your hands
up on the chair.

32:57.850 --> 33:00.228
Keep your hands
on the chair right there.
Everybody stay calm.

33:00.228 --> 33:04.232
-Stay in your seats, please.
-God, please, it hurts.

33:04.232 --> 33:06.859
That was a friend of mine
you threw shots at
yesterday,

33:06.859 --> 33:09.445
so you just save your breath
about where it hurts.

33:09.445 --> 33:12.365
What is this crap?
Hey, what the hell
are you doing here?

33:12.365 --> 33:14.951
Yo, Eddie. You taking
a trip to Baltimore?

33:14.951 --> 33:18.287
The bus is gonna be
delayed, like, 10 minutes.

33:18.287 --> 33:20.665
Look, our squad caught
the call, all right?

33:20.665 --> 33:22.875
The ticket lady
identified them
from our sketch.

33:22.875 --> 33:26.504
You better explain yourself,
Simone. This look like
the damn 15th Precinct?

33:26.504 --> 33:28.464
Hey, hey, we got a tip,
we moved on it.

33:28.464 --> 33:30.466
I don't know what
you did in the tunnel
all those years,

33:30.466 --> 33:32.885
but up here, that's what
you're supposed to do.

33:32.885 --> 33:36.097
So you got your first grade?
The hell with the next man
trying to get his.

33:36.097 --> 33:39.100
-Is that the story, Simone?
-I got my first grade
from a lot of hard work...

33:39.100 --> 33:42.228
with my partners,
not humping other detectives.

33:42.228 --> 33:45.857
Get your act together, Eddie,
or you're never gonna
be anything on this job.

34:03.666 --> 34:07.128
-You track down the third
partner in that con game?
-Oh, no, not yet.

34:07.128 --> 34:10.923
Black girl's given us
a number of addresses
and hangouts on him.

34:10.923 --> 34:12.091
She really
wants to help herself.

34:12.091 --> 34:14.886
-You did good work
on this, Diane.
-It was James's plan.

34:16.220 --> 34:18.765
Captain? We need to talk?

34:18.765 --> 34:20.683
Yeah.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.354
On this cop's transfer,

34:25.354 --> 34:30.401
I need to tell you,
I don't think
it was your finest hour.

34:30.401 --> 34:32.779
Why is that?

34:32.779 --> 34:35.740
The both of us know the job
has an Ethical Awareness
Course...

34:35.740 --> 34:37.575
for this kind of cop
and this kind of situation.

34:37.575 --> 34:40.161
The sensitivity class isn't
going to do it for this guy.

34:40.161 --> 34:43.581
Arthur, if Szymanski's
like you say he is,

34:43.581 --> 34:46.542
don't like black people
much to begin with,

34:46.542 --> 34:50.546
plus resentful now,
from his point of view,
a black boss loused his life up.

34:50.546 --> 34:54.801
Is that the kind of cop you want
walking around a neighborhood
don't need any extra problems?

34:54.801 --> 34:58.096
So, you're concerned I'd be
lowering the quality of life
in Bed-Stuy?

34:58.096 --> 35:02.433
I'm just pointing out
what I know you know already.

35:02.433 --> 35:06.145
As bosses, our decisions
have consequences outside
the rooms we make 'em in.

35:06.145 --> 35:08.856
If you wanna discuss
the quality of policing
of black neighborhoods,

35:08.856 --> 35:11.400
we can take that up in length,
but what's going on here...

35:11.400 --> 35:15.029
is what always goes on
with the black man on this job
who asks for an accommodation.

35:15.029 --> 35:17.406
It's assumed he's got
a hidden agenda.

35:17.406 --> 35:20.660
Look, I came here asking
for you to look at using
your juice to hurt this guy...

35:20.660 --> 35:25.581
and remind you that people
neither you nor I know
are liable to pay the tab.

35:25.581 --> 35:29.585
Pretending it's about you being
black so you don't have to face
what it is you're doing,

35:29.585 --> 35:31.087
that's on you.

35:35.049 --> 35:38.678
Okay, okay.

35:38.678 --> 35:41.430
-Transfer him
to this precinct.
-Transfer him here?

35:41.430 --> 35:46.102
Yeah, that way I can deal
every day with the consequences
of the decisions we made here.

35:49.689 --> 35:52.024
I think over time,

35:52.024 --> 35:56.654
knowing the kind of man you are
at heart, might turn out good
for Szymanski.

35:56.654 --> 36:02.243
-Might be good for you too.
-I think we've looked enough
into my heart and soul.

36:02.243 --> 36:03.870
Is sending him here
acceptable to you?

36:03.870 --> 36:07.206
Yeah.
I can make that happen.

36:25.433 --> 36:27.476
-Hey, Greg.
-Hey, Abby.

36:27.476 --> 36:29.854
-You have a good shift?
-Yeah, yeah.

36:29.854 --> 36:34.025
We shut down one of those
"found money" con teams.

36:34.025 --> 36:36.861
-You just on your way in?
-4:00 to 12:00.

36:36.861 --> 36:38.946
Yeah. You like it there
in Anticrime?

36:38.946 --> 36:41.657
Yeah, I do.

36:41.657 --> 36:44.952
Greg, could you find time
for dinner sometime
in the next while?

36:44.952 --> 36:48.080
Sure, of course.

36:48.080 --> 36:52.585
Uh, what's the occasion,
just a pleasant meal
between friends?

36:52.585 --> 36:55.254
Well, I hoped that it
was a pleasant meal...

36:55.254 --> 36:57.798
that might result
in a special occasion.

36:57.798 --> 37:03.512
Well, that's very mysterious
and interesting.

37:03.512 --> 37:07.016
Well, I-I'm not comfortable
being more specific.

37:07.016 --> 37:10.436
Well, sure.
Um, just let me know
the day.

37:10.436 --> 37:14.649
I got broad areas
of empty calendar.
Thanks a lot.

37:14.649 --> 37:16.609
Sure.
Have a good shift, Abby.
Night, Greg.

37:16.609 --> 37:18.236
Have a good night.

37:30.748 --> 37:32.875
What's going on, Andy?

37:36.295 --> 37:38.881
(clears throat)

37:38.881 --> 37:43.719
Uh, you think it's possible...

37:43.719 --> 37:49.350
people that have passed on,
making contact with the living?

37:49.350 --> 37:52.436
-You mean like ghosts?
-Yeah, more so by way
of your dreams.

37:53.479 --> 37:56.732
-I don't know.
-[ Sighs ]

37:56.732 --> 38:01.737
Me working these robberies,
Andy Jr. being killed
in a bar,

38:01.737 --> 38:05.992
I can see rationally how
a dream might manifest
from that.

38:05.992 --> 38:08.327
What happens
in the dream?

38:08.327 --> 38:12.999
We're in contact.
Don't exactly get along.

38:14.417 --> 38:16.919
Ah, I don't believe
it's possible.

38:16.919 --> 38:21.007
I used to dream
about my wife quite a bit.
Yeah?

38:21.007 --> 38:25.177
Never seemed to have
any particular meaning.

38:25.177 --> 38:27.847
Me cooking meals for her,
taking her out on walks
and stuff.

38:27.847 --> 38:32.768
So, she never came
with tips on horses to bet?
Nothing like that?

38:32.768 --> 38:34.812
Nah.

39:01.297 --> 39:03.424
Something alcoholic?

39:03.424 --> 39:06.510
-We collared those guys
stuck you up.
-Is that right?

39:06.510 --> 39:09.096
Collared 'em on a bus.

39:09.096 --> 39:10.681
Large vehicle.

39:16.062 --> 39:18.647
Son!
(chuckles)

39:18.647 --> 39:20.941
I am so relieved.

39:22.818 --> 39:25.363
You know
who's in the bathroom
that I brought with me?

39:25.363 --> 39:28.657
-Who?
-Sylvia and the baby.

39:28.657 --> 39:32.370
They're both
in the ladies' room. I told her
to keep his eyes covered.

39:32.370 --> 39:35.998
To be truthful,
I-I don't think
they should be present here.

39:39.251 --> 39:41.754
Think I brought 'em
to expose Theo to liquor?

39:41.754 --> 39:43.881
Look, I--I don't wanna
fight with you.

39:43.881 --> 39:48.177
Well, I can't do nothing right.
I brought him to meet
his brother.

39:48.177 --> 39:50.805
Think seeing me murdered
is gonna make a happy memory?

39:54.433 --> 39:58.687
(gasping)

39:58.687 --> 40:01.107
This is where
you were murdered.

40:01.107 --> 40:03.192
I just don't wanna
complicate it.

40:10.449 --> 40:13.661
These murdering bastards.

40:13.661 --> 40:16.831
What the system
lets walk around.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.958
Dad, I don't wanna
complicate it.

40:18.958 --> 40:21.085
I'm a police officer,
you understand that?

40:21.919 --> 40:25.506
-It makes certain claims
on my time.
-Oh, here we go.

40:25.506 --> 40:29.635
-These are the skells
killed you.
-Gee, Pop, really?

40:29.635 --> 40:31.929
You think they'll stop
with killing you? This is
why I have to do this.

40:31.929 --> 40:34.515
That's crap.

40:40.604 --> 40:43.232
The balls you sit here.

40:55.161 --> 40:57.163
-Great, Dad.
-You shut up.

40:57.163 --> 40:59.748
You don't know nothing
how the world is.

40:59.748 --> 41:03.252
Yeah, I was really
sheltered being murdered.

41:07.756 --> 41:11.510
Oh, my God.
What did I do?

41:11.510 --> 41:13.637
What did I do?

41:20.769 --> 41:24.565
-What's your problem?
-I gave you my seat
at the diner.

41:24.565 --> 41:26.984
We're gonna be
lifetime companions?

41:26.984 --> 41:32.072
That's Jesus Christ, Dad.
Congratulations pissin' off
Jesus Christ.

41:35.534 --> 41:39.038
That's your boss?
He's traveling with you?

41:42.666 --> 41:44.710
Dead as when he started.

41:45.544 --> 41:48.589
-What did I do?
-What did I tell ya?

41:48.589 --> 41:50.758
I don't recall.

41:53.802 --> 41:57.223
Talk through me.
Talk through me.

41:57.223 --> 41:59.558
Please give me another chance.

42:01.393 --> 42:03.646
What did you just have?

42:21.997 --> 42:27.294
I-I loved him,
as bad as I am.

42:27.294 --> 42:29.797
Oh, my poor boy.

42:54.863 --> 42:56.865
(sniffles)

42:56.865 --> 42:58.826
Good boy.

43:01.412 --> 43:03.956
Good boy.

43:04.873 --> 43:07.293
(sniffles)

43:07.293 --> 43:09.461
Good boy.

43:19.054 --> 43:22.057
