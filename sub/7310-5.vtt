00:10.700 --> 00:13.800
I've got that marketing meeting at
1:30. You got to make this quick.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.500
Not too quick.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.400
You think Anderson's secretary
saw us leaving together?

00:20.600 --> 00:21.900
We were going to lunch.

00:22.300 --> 00:24.900
She's been looking at me
funny the last couple weeks.

00:25.200 --> 00:26.600
She knows my husband.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.400
What the hell is that?

00:34.600 --> 00:36.200
Thought you'd like it.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.200
Your sailor's real nervous.

01:32.300 --> 01:35.100
Tried to talk to him, but
he's not making a lot of sense.

01:35.600 --> 01:38.100
- You get his name?
- No. Shut down.

01:38.400 --> 01:40.500
Threatened to jump
if we didn't back off.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.500
Hose jockeys want to set an airbag.

01:42.700 --> 01:43.700
That height?

01:43.800 --> 01:46.100
I don't think it's going to
make much of a difference.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.300
I don't think Gibbs knows.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.850
Not going to hear it from me.

01:50.885 --> 01:52.300
Not going to hear what from you?

01:52.500 --> 01:54.300
Abby may have gotten a job offer.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.100
- Big bucks.
- Allegedly.

01:56.135 --> 01:57.135
Private sector.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.500
Still just a rumor, Tony.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.965
Not anymore, probie-san.
Someone from Human Resources

02:01.000 --> 02:03.500
told a friend of a friend that
Abby had cocktails last night

02:03.535 --> 02:05.600
at the Ritz-Carlton with
a corporate headhunter.

02:05.700 --> 02:06.965
And this friend told you?

02:07.000 --> 02:09.100
Not exactly. I overheard
it in the elevator.

02:10.100 --> 02:11.565
Very reliable source.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.700
Abby was probably on a date.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.900
Abby on a date at the Ritz-Carlton?

02:17.100 --> 02:18.700
Strictly business time, Ziva.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.000
They say which business?

02:20.100 --> 02:22.400
Well, the elevator reached
my floor, I had to get off.

02:22.700 --> 02:24.200
Oh, that's a long way up.

02:24.500 --> 02:25.700
Long way down.

02:31.300 --> 02:33.965
Okay, so what you want to do is
gain his confidence here, boss.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
He's been out there for a while.
He's obviously having second thoughts.

02:37.600 --> 02:38.600
Stay.

02:41.500 --> 02:42.700
Get away from me.

02:44.500 --> 02:45.800
Just want to talk.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.100
No!

02:47.900 --> 02:49.700
Make it easier if I knew your name.

02:50.800 --> 02:53.400
- Where you stationed?
- I said leave me alone!

03:01.000 --> 03:04.200
Boss, you know, we could snap
a picture of him with a cell,

03:04.400 --> 03:07.300
e- mail it to Abby, get her to
run it through photo-recognition.

03:07.335 --> 03:09.200
If he went to the
Academy, we get a quick ID.

03:09.235 --> 03:10.235
Do it.

03:10.400 --> 03:11.265
Me?

03:11.300 --> 03:12.700
It's your idea, McGee.

03:13.100 --> 03:14.100
Right.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.400
Boss?

03:32.200 --> 03:33.800
I'm not very good with heights.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.300
Point. Point and click.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.300
Don't come any closer!

03:40.200 --> 03:42.400
- What are you doing?
- Wouldn't give me your name.

03:42.600 --> 03:43.900
Want to know who you are.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.200
Yeah.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.600
Great view of the Washington
Monument from up here.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.300
- Abigail?
- What's up, Doc?

04:00.400 --> 04:02.300
Had a report for Jethro, but I...

04:02.335 --> 04:03.600
Is that what I think it is?

04:04.400 --> 04:07.600
If you're thinking it's a
firearm, the answer is yes.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.500
I thought you might have seen him.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.565
He appears to be in
his late 20s, although,

04:11.600 --> 04:14.300
from my vantage point, that
is very difficult to confirm.

04:16.100 --> 04:17.700
McGee, he's got a gun.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.000
Boss, he's got a gun.

04:23.100 --> 04:24.465
Yeah, yeah.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.400
I know that, McGee. I see that.

04:32.100 --> 04:35.200
I'm running the image against
the last ten Academy classes.

04:35.235 --> 04:37.600
What could make a
young man so desperate?

04:40.000 --> 04:41.100
I got it, McGee.

04:41.300 --> 04:43.900
Boss, his name is
Lieutenant Michael Arnett.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.500
Stationed at the Pentagon.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.700
Academy class of '01.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.600
He's a linguist, translator.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.100
Married, no kids.

04:53.300 --> 04:54.400
So, Michael?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.700
You mind if I call you Michael?

04:58.200 --> 04:59.200
You can't help.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.100
I can try.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.400
Don't.

05:06.100 --> 05:07.500
I do not have a shot.

05:07.600 --> 05:08.850
I'll hit Gibbs, too.

05:08.885 --> 05:10.100
Lean back, boss.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.300
Just ease back.

05:17.100 --> 05:18.400
Damn you, Gibbs!

05:18.800 --> 05:20.300
You take too many chances.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.065
All right, boss, his wife

05:22.100 --> 05:24.700
works at a travel agency on K Street.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.000
Name's Dana.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.300
She's at lunch.

05:27.500 --> 05:28.965
Her boss has no idea where she went.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.400
Trying to get a hold of your
wife. You want to talk to her?

05:31.435 --> 05:32.435
No!

05:35.200 --> 05:36.200
She left me.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.100
Yeah. I've been there.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.400
That's tough.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.200
It's not worth your life.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.500
It's more complicated than that.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.100
Tell me.

05:52.600 --> 05:53.700
It's too late.

05:54.600 --> 05:55.850
He's got a sister.

05:55.885 --> 05:57.065
Her name's Rachel.

05:57.100 --> 05:58.400
You want to talk to Rachel?

06:01.400 --> 06:02.400
How old is she?

06:04.500 --> 06:05.500
17.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.400
17?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.100
What does that make her...
a senior in high school?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.700
You want Rachel to remember
this from her senior year?

06:17.000 --> 06:18.900
I don't want to make that call, Mike.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.800
Why don't we start with the gun, huh?

06:32.200 --> 06:33.400
I really messed up.

06:35.100 --> 06:36.600
I should have told someone.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.200
You tell me.

06:38.500 --> 06:39.500
I'll help you.

06:41.800 --> 06:42.900
You can trust me.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Put it down.

07:01.500 --> 07:02.500
I'll help you.

07:07.900 --> 07:09.000
Take it really easy.

07:41.045 --> 07:42.145
Slug is flattened.

07:42.245 --> 07:43.845
Not much for Abby to work with.

07:44.745 --> 07:46.045
She had success with less.

07:46.145 --> 07:48.745
Shot definitely came from the
building across from the hotel.

07:48.845 --> 07:50.345
Door to the rooftop was picked.

07:50.445 --> 07:52.445
No shell casings, no prints, nothing.

07:52.545 --> 07:54.645
Several people in the
building heard the shot.

07:54.680 --> 07:56.345
Witnesses on the street saw the flash.

07:56.445 --> 07:59.245
Guy's going to kill himself. When
he doesn't, someone does it for him.

07:59.280 --> 08:00.280
Why?

08:02.145 --> 08:03.345
Arnett's apartment.

08:03.645 --> 08:06.245
Color back now that you're on
terra firma there, probalicious?

08:06.345 --> 08:08.145
- Hey, I would have done it...
- Only...

08:09.245 --> 08:10.210
you didn't.

08:10.245 --> 08:12.345
I think he's more afraid
of heights than you are.

08:12.380 --> 08:13.645
Please. I rock-climbed.

08:14.545 --> 08:15.645
Yeah. 20 feet,

08:15.745 --> 08:17.545
with a harness, to impress a girl.

08:17.580 --> 08:18.645
Well, it worked.

08:30.945 --> 08:32.745
Having an eyewitness like you makes

08:32.845 --> 08:34.345
my job a lot easier.

08:37.145 --> 08:40.845
Nevertheless, I will get you
autopsy results post-haste.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.145
Thanks, Duck.

08:51.645 --> 08:54.145
There's absolutely no
evidence a woman lived here.

08:54.545 --> 08:56.445
Manager said she moved out a week ago.

08:56.545 --> 08:57.545
Gibbs was right.

08:57.745 --> 08:59.545
In a divorce, the guy gets screwed.

08:59.745 --> 09:01.245
She left him diddly-squat.

09:01.445 --> 09:03.145
Maybe she had a good
reason to leave him.

09:03.180 --> 09:05.145
Poor guy's sleeping on a blow-up bed.

09:05.345 --> 09:07.345
Good marriage needs good communication.

09:08.345 --> 09:10.545
Here's another reason
he'd want to end it all:

09:10.845 --> 09:11.945
Rejuvinator.

09:13.345 --> 09:14.845
Arnett was losing his hair.

09:14.945 --> 09:16.845
Maybe he didn't talk to her anymore.

09:18.445 --> 09:19.745
He was younger than I am.

09:19.845 --> 09:21.045
Or didn't listen.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.345
She did leave him something.

09:25.645 --> 09:28.145
A sad commentary on
the state of matrimony?

09:29.345 --> 09:30.845
No. A pink toothbrush.

09:37.145 --> 09:39.545
I'm fast, but I'm not that fast.

09:41.045 --> 09:42.645
Something still bothering you?

09:43.845 --> 09:44.845
Yeah.

09:45.045 --> 09:47.545
We're investigating a
homicide and a suicide.

09:47.645 --> 09:49.745
Was the reason the lieutenant
was out on the ledge

09:49.780 --> 09:51.145
the same reason that he was shot?

09:54.045 --> 09:56.045
I guess you wouldn't
know that yet, would you?

09:56.545 --> 09:57.845
He was coming in.

10:02.145 --> 10:03.545
Wanted to tell me something.

10:09.345 --> 10:10.545
Confucius say:

10:11.445 --> 10:13.745
"Life's many pleasures await you."

10:14.845 --> 10:15.845
What yours say?

10:17.745 --> 10:21.145
"As you approach life's
crossroads, look both ways."

10:22.445 --> 10:23.845
I'm sure it's meaningful.

10:24.045 --> 10:26.045
Just think about it and
search your inner self.

10:27.745 --> 10:29.745
"Lisa Nerlman, Hypnotherapist."

10:31.145 --> 10:33.645
- What is this for?
- She does wonders with phobias.

10:34.145 --> 10:35.545
Tony, who else did you tell?

10:36.645 --> 10:38.945
I told you it was a very
sensitive subject, Abby.

10:39.545 --> 10:40.545
Your turn.

10:41.445 --> 10:43.545
I refuse to make
decisions based on stupid

10:43.580 --> 10:45.445
sayings stuffed inside stale cookies.

10:48.145 --> 10:50.745
"Welcome an invitation that
change your financial future."

10:52.645 --> 10:53.645
Got to go.

10:56.145 --> 10:57.245
That was incredible.

10:57.545 --> 10:59.545
It was fate that Abby
opened that cookie.

10:59.580 --> 11:01.845
She's good. She didn't blink an eye.

11:01.945 --> 11:03.545
That's why I don't play poker with her.

11:03.645 --> 11:04.645
No tell.

11:04.745 --> 11:06.545
He was sleeping on
an air mattress, boss.

11:06.580 --> 11:07.310
The wife?

11:07.345 --> 11:10.045
Staying at Lafayette Court
Hotel. She's coming in at 5:00.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.680
Wants to talk to Arnett's parents first.

11:11.745 --> 11:13.745
Would have bet we'd find
a suicide note. No luck.

11:13.780 --> 11:15.045
That'd be too easy.

11:15.145 --> 11:16.745
I took his computer down to Abby.

11:16.845 --> 11:18.145
Maybe she will get lucky.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.145
He's a second-generation American.

11:20.245 --> 11:22.445
Grandparents emigrated from Syria.

11:22.545 --> 11:24.545
His fluency in Arabic
led to his advancement

11:24.580 --> 11:26.510
and special assignments
in the Middle East.

11:26.545 --> 11:29.345
Presently assigned at the
Office of the Deputy Secretary

11:29.445 --> 11:31.310
of Defense for Combating Terrorism.

11:31.345 --> 11:34.845
Other than that, I can't tell you much.
I'm getting stonewalled by the Pentagon.

11:34.945 --> 11:36.745
They won't even connect me to his CO.

11:37.345 --> 11:38.345
Yeah, Gibbs.

11:40.045 --> 11:41.045
On my way.

11:41.545 --> 11:43.345
Let's go, McGee. You're with me.

11:45.145 --> 11:46.410
Special Agent Gibbs.

11:46.445 --> 11:48.845
Captain Walsh, Lieutenant Arnett's CO.

11:50.245 --> 11:51.645
You're a hard man to reach.

11:52.345 --> 11:53.545
My hands were tied.

11:53.845 --> 11:55.956
I had to get permission
from the Director of National.

11:55.980 --> 11:57.145
Intelligence to talk to you.

11:57.245 --> 11:59.045
Secnav has to make a decision.

11:59.145 --> 12:01.645
Unless you can tell me Lieutenant
Arnett's murder was unrelated

12:01.680 --> 12:03.945
to his Navy duties, my
unit's going into lockdown.

12:04.145 --> 12:05.510
I can't tell you that, Captain.

12:05.545 --> 12:07.345
We're just beginning our investigation.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.645
How long is this going to take?

12:10.680 --> 12:11.845
At this point,

12:12.145 --> 12:14.445
no one will even tell
me what Arnett does.

12:15.045 --> 12:16.045
Did.

12:16.145 --> 12:18.245
Captain Walsh just briefed me

12:18.345 --> 12:20.745
on Lieutenant Arnett's general duties.

12:21.445 --> 12:24.045
He was an Arab-speaking
intelligence officer,

12:24.145 --> 12:25.710
working assets in the Middle East.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.945
Personally responsible for
exposing a number of Al-Qaeda ops.

12:28.980 --> 12:30.845
I'm sure he was high on their hit list.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.110
What was he working on?

12:32.145 --> 12:34.045
Tracking down an Al-Qaeda operative.

12:34.445 --> 12:36.445
- Where?
- Right here.

12:36.480 --> 12:37.480
In DC.

12:37.945 --> 12:39.445
What the hell happened up there?

12:40.545 --> 12:41.645
He was going to jump.

12:42.345 --> 12:43.345
Why?

12:43.745 --> 12:44.845
Working on it.

12:46.445 --> 12:48.210
We've got an Al-Qaeda
operative on the loose.

12:48.245 --> 12:50.945
If you'd done your job and
pulled Arnett off that ledge,

12:51.345 --> 12:52.945
my best man wouldn't be dead.

12:53.645 --> 12:55.445
So, you'd better be working on it.

13:09.545 --> 13:11.945
Unit's in lockdown.
All work's been secured.

13:12.145 --> 13:13.645
The section restricted to quarters.

13:13.745 --> 13:16.645
National security's at risk, my
people are sitting on their hands.

13:16.845 --> 13:18.245
How long is this going to take?

13:18.445 --> 13:20.245
We're working as fast as we can.

13:21.445 --> 13:23.945
When was the last time
you saw Lieutenant Arnett?

13:24.845 --> 13:25.845
Two days ago.

13:26.745 --> 13:27.845
He seemed fine.

13:28.345 --> 13:29.345
Called in sick.

13:29.945 --> 13:30.945
His desk.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.745
He tell you anything up there?

13:34.945 --> 13:37.045
We need to know more about
this current operation.

13:37.345 --> 13:38.645
Told you as much as I can.

13:38.745 --> 13:39.910
Don't suppose I can

13:39.945 --> 13:41.745
copy the contents of his hard drive?

13:43.145 --> 13:44.345
You want answers.

13:48.745 --> 13:49.945
Personal effects.

13:50.645 --> 13:51.645
Best I can do.

13:56.545 --> 13:57.545
This his wife?

13:58.945 --> 13:59.945
You met her?

14:00.445 --> 14:01.545
Married about a year.

14:02.345 --> 14:03.445
Separated

14:03.545 --> 14:04.545
last week.

14:05.845 --> 14:06.845
Didn't know.

14:06.945 --> 14:08.945
Any change in Arnett's behavior lately?

14:09.145 --> 14:10.245
He was always quiet.

14:10.345 --> 14:11.945
Maybe more so recently.

14:12.145 --> 14:13.145
He did his job.

14:13.545 --> 14:15.245
Never shared anything personal.

14:19.445 --> 14:20.445
Phenelzine.

14:21.345 --> 14:22.745
Strong antidepressant.

14:23.145 --> 14:24.945
Did you know he was taking medication?

14:25.745 --> 14:26.745
That all we get?

14:28.845 --> 14:30.245
I'll go through his files.

14:30.845 --> 14:32.045
See what I can give you.

14:40.245 --> 14:41.345
Keep me in the loop,

14:41.545 --> 14:42.945
Special Agent Gibbs.

14:53.145 --> 14:54.145
Okay.

14:54.345 --> 14:56.145
We'll be right there. Thank you.

14:56.245 --> 14:58.945
I can't believe Abby would think
of leaving without saying anything.

14:58.980 --> 15:00.210
Get over it, Tony.

15:00.245 --> 15:02.345
I mean, I understand her
not telling you, but me?

15:02.445 --> 15:04.445
I mean I've known her
for a long time, you know.

15:04.545 --> 15:05.710
Arnett's wife is here.

15:05.745 --> 15:07.945
I am having her brought
over to the conference room.

15:21.445 --> 15:23.745
Boss, I got an address
for Dr. Neil Fleming.

15:24.045 --> 15:25.845
Prescribed Arnett the medication.

15:25.945 --> 15:28.545
He's not military. Has a
private practice in Georgetown.

15:28.645 --> 15:30.345
Guy gets free medical
care from the Navy,

15:30.445 --> 15:33.045
goes to a shrink who
probably charges $350 an hour.

15:33.345 --> 15:34.445
I'll check him out.

15:34.545 --> 15:35.545
With him, DiNozzo.

15:35.580 --> 15:36.580
With him, boss.

15:36.645 --> 15:38.545
Our marriage was doomed from the start.

15:38.945 --> 15:41.645
The Navy took advantage of
Michael's language skills.

15:42.045 --> 15:43.710
They assigned, reassigned him

15:43.745 --> 15:45.445
to dangerous posts in the Middle East.

15:45.845 --> 15:47.445
The few times he was home,

15:48.045 --> 15:49.045
he was uptight.

15:49.445 --> 15:51.245
He wouldn't want to
talk about what he did.

15:52.445 --> 15:54.145
I became more and more frustrated.

15:54.445 --> 15:55.945
Did you discuss it with him?

15:56.845 --> 15:58.445
We tried marriage counseling.

15:59.445 --> 16:00.445
It didn't help.

16:00.845 --> 16:02.010
Michael couldn't open up.

16:02.045 --> 16:03.945
Did you know he was
seeing a psychiatrist?

16:06.345 --> 16:07.345
No.

16:08.145 --> 16:09.145
I...

16:09.845 --> 16:12.245
I wanted him to get help...

16:13.545 --> 16:14.945
I didn't think he would.

16:16.245 --> 16:18.045
It was your idea to separate?

16:18.245 --> 16:20.845
I thought it would force
him to face our problems.

16:22.645 --> 16:23.645
It was a mistake.

16:26.545 --> 16:27.645
Where did you meet?

16:28.145 --> 16:29.445
The National Gallery.

16:29.645 --> 16:32.045
An exhibit of Mesopotamian art. I was...

16:33.345 --> 16:35.845
standing, admiring a sculpture, and

16:36.245 --> 16:37.545
Michael was behind me.

16:38.345 --> 16:40.145
He began explaining the piece to me.

16:41.545 --> 16:42.645
He brought it to life.

16:44.245 --> 16:46.145
He was the most intelligent
man I'd ever met.

16:46.845 --> 16:48.045
He made me laugh.

16:50.845 --> 16:52.545
I haven't seen him laugh in a long time.

16:55.345 --> 16:57.445
You're not surprised he was suicidal.

16:59.945 --> 17:01.945
What does surprise me
is that he was murdered.

17:04.145 --> 17:05.145
Why, Agent Gibbs?

17:07.545 --> 17:08.545
Why?

17:21.444 --> 17:22.444
Don't do that.

17:22.545 --> 17:23.545
Do what?

17:23.645 --> 17:25.944
The doctor might be in
with a patient, Tony.

17:27.444 --> 17:28.945
That tells him someone's here?

17:31.245 --> 17:33.145
You ever been to a therapist before?

17:33.345 --> 17:34.645
Me? No.

17:36.245 --> 17:37.245
You?

17:40.645 --> 17:41.445
Yeah,

17:41.645 --> 17:42.845
once, when I was young.

17:43.245 --> 17:44.345
For your acrophobia?

17:44.545 --> 17:46.545
You're blowing that all
out of proportion, Tony.

17:46.580 --> 17:47.580
Well,

17:47.645 --> 17:50.445
you showed a pathological
fear of heights earlier today.

17:50.545 --> 17:52.345
I was staring down ten stories.

17:52.445 --> 17:54.945
Getting a little disoriented,
it's a little understandable.

17:55.145 --> 17:56.145
Disoriented?

17:56.345 --> 17:58.645
You had your panties in a
twist. Tears in your eyes.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.445
Wait. I couldn't see your eyes
'cause they were shut so tight.

18:01.845 --> 18:03.545
You were hysterical like a little girl.

18:03.580 --> 18:04.580
I was not.

18:04.645 --> 18:05.945
You were hugging the ladder.

18:06.145 --> 18:07.145
Ladder-hugger.

18:08.245 --> 18:10.145
And I got the photographic evidence.

18:11.245 --> 18:13.345
Let technology show you the truth.

18:14.045 --> 18:15.545
My eyes are not closed.

18:15.580 --> 18:16.645
I was blinking.

18:18.045 --> 18:20.045
Is that... is that what you're doing?

18:20.745 --> 18:22.145
Let's let the people decide.

18:22.245 --> 18:23.945
You are not gonna post that on YouTube.

18:24.445 --> 18:25.445
I might.

18:25.545 --> 18:27.245
You, give me that thing or I'm gonna...

18:27.545 --> 18:29.145
What are you gonna do? Yeah!

18:29.445 --> 18:31.645
- Slap you silly!
- You're not getting it.

18:35.045 --> 18:37.645
You two have deeper issues
than you discussed on the phone.

18:38.545 --> 18:39.545
On the phone?

18:39.645 --> 18:42.245
Aren't you the couple who called
up about marriage counseling?

18:42.745 --> 18:43.745
Couple?

18:43.780 --> 18:44.780
Us? No, no.

18:44.845 --> 18:47.445
It's okay, Timmy. Timmy,
we're in a safe place.

18:47.745 --> 18:49.045
We can be ourselves here.

18:49.745 --> 18:51.245
We just got back from Vermont.

18:51.345 --> 18:52.545
Pretty this time of year.

18:53.545 --> 18:54.545
Sorry.

18:55.745 --> 18:56.745
NCIS.

18:56.845 --> 18:58.445
Special Agents McGee,

18:58.545 --> 18:59.645
DiNozzo.

19:00.345 --> 19:01.645
Very special agents.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.345
I've been seeing patients all day.

19:08.945 --> 19:10.245
I didn't hear about Michael.

19:10.445 --> 19:11.845
Why was he seeking your help?

19:14.045 --> 19:15.145
I can't discuss that.

19:15.245 --> 19:17.145
Doctor, we're investigating his murder.

19:17.245 --> 19:20.545
His job at the Pentagon makes
it a matter of national security.

19:21.545 --> 19:22.945
Well, I'm bound by ethics

19:23.345 --> 19:24.345
and HIPAA laws.

19:24.445 --> 19:25.745
That ended with his death.

19:25.780 --> 19:26.710
Not for me.

19:26.745 --> 19:30.145
Well, can you at least explain
to us why a Naval officer,

19:30.245 --> 19:33.145
with free medical care, would
come to a civilian doctor?

19:33.545 --> 19:36.345
I have several patients in the
military whose psychological problems,

19:36.445 --> 19:38.345
if known, would
jeopardize their careers.

19:39.245 --> 19:40.345
I can tell you this.

19:40.545 --> 19:43.245
The last time I saw Michael
Arnett, he was depressed...

19:43.545 --> 19:44.545
not suicidal.

19:45.045 --> 19:46.445
Now, without a court order,

19:46.745 --> 19:47.945
that's all I'm saying.

20:07.945 --> 20:09.345
I heard that, DiNozzo.

20:09.545 --> 20:11.445
Another wise-ass comment
like that I'll smack

20:11.545 --> 20:13.645
you so hard your grand
children will feel it.

20:13.745 --> 20:15.045
Think it's funny, McGee?

20:15.345 --> 20:16.945
Wipe that smile off your face.

20:17.045 --> 20:18.845
That goes for you, too, David.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.245
Special Agent Gibbs.

20:29.545 --> 20:31.545
You're standing behind me, aren't you?

20:31.945 --> 20:32.945
Yup.

20:35.345 --> 20:38.145
Feeling real secure about
your job, are you, Abs?

20:40.145 --> 20:41.645
Not so much anymore.

20:46.945 --> 20:49.345
You up here cause you
got something for me, Abs?

20:50.245 --> 20:51.245
Yup.

20:51.845 --> 20:53.145
Ballistics on the bullet?

20:53.345 --> 20:55.945
It's a mangled, useless chunk of lead.

20:56.045 --> 20:58.895
Well, actually, only the core
is lead because the jacket

20:58.930 --> 21:01.745
is 95% copper and 5% zinc,
but you already knew that.

21:03.245 --> 21:04.345
Arnett's computer?

21:04.445 --> 21:06.545
Scrubbed clean like the
day it was born in Taiwan.

21:15.145 --> 21:16.645
Lieutenant Arnett's cell phone.

21:16.745 --> 21:18.845
It was in his pocket when he fell, so

21:19.045 --> 21:20.645
it's as squished as he is,

21:20.745 --> 21:23.845
but I removed the CPU and I
stripped away the peripheral...

21:25.545 --> 21:28.645
You're not gonna like who he
received his last call from, Gibbs.

21:31.945 --> 21:32.945
Who?

21:33.745 --> 21:34.745
Us.

21:35.245 --> 21:36.245
NCIS.

21:37.545 --> 21:40.345
Someone called Lieutenant
Arnett from inside this building.

21:52.645 --> 21:53.845
Director Shepard.

21:53.945 --> 21:56.045
I appreciate you getting here so fast.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.080
No problem.

22:00.045 --> 22:01.345
Is something wrong, Nikki?

22:02.245 --> 22:03.345
May I be frank?

22:03.545 --> 22:04.545
Of course.

22:05.245 --> 22:08.645
I know I'm only a low-level
NCIS Intel Analyst.

22:08.745 --> 22:10.710
And I am more than happy to do

22:10.745 --> 22:12.845
whatever the Agency requires of me,

22:13.145 --> 22:14.210
but I resent

22:14.245 --> 22:17.545
having a rude message left on
my phone by Special Agent Gibbs.

22:17.945 --> 22:21.945
With no explanation at all, in the
most condescending and insulting manner,

22:21.980 --> 22:23.945
he demanded that I get
in here immediately.

22:24.145 --> 22:25.945
He certainly lives up to his reputation.

22:26.245 --> 22:29.545
Special Agent Gibbs isn't
known for his people skills.

22:29.580 --> 22:31.645
I'm sorry, Director Shepard, I just...

22:32.145 --> 22:33.145
needed to vent.

22:33.345 --> 22:34.545
What's this about?

22:34.745 --> 22:35.845
You don't know?

22:43.645 --> 22:44.945
I have no idea.

22:45.445 --> 22:48.045
What about the murder of
Lieutenant Michael Arnett?

22:49.145 --> 22:50.145
He's dead?

22:50.945 --> 22:52.545
I just called him this morning.

22:53.345 --> 22:54.645
That's why you're here.

22:54.745 --> 22:57.845
Half of Washington watched him
get shot on live television.

22:58.145 --> 22:59.510
NCIS was on scene.

22:59.545 --> 23:01.945
You work in this building
and had you "no idea"?

23:02.945 --> 23:04.045
When did it happen?

23:04.145 --> 23:06.045
A little before 1:00 this afternoon.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.245
I was home...

23:07.280 --> 23:08.310
asleep.

23:08.345 --> 23:11.045
I've been working the Middle East
desk for the past couple days.

23:11.145 --> 23:13.545
Everyone I had to speak to
is eight hours ahead of us.

23:13.645 --> 23:14.745
I was here all night.

23:14.845 --> 23:15.845
Working on what?

23:18.645 --> 23:21.045
Navy counterterrorism intel has

23:21.145 --> 23:23.345
suffered leaks over the last few months.

23:23.445 --> 23:26.645
Al-Qaeda has managed to
get a step ahead of us.

23:26.745 --> 23:27.945
We suspect a mole.

23:28.045 --> 23:31.845
Nikki has been analyzing data trying
to look for a common denominator.

23:32.945 --> 23:34.410
I had no idea

23:34.445 --> 23:36.145
it involved Lieutenant Arnett.

23:36.545 --> 23:37.645
What's his connection?

23:38.445 --> 23:41.345
Well, Lieutenant Arnett
had gone outside the wire,

23:41.445 --> 23:43.245
working contacts in Djibouti,

23:43.345 --> 23:44.845
gathering valuable intel,

23:45.345 --> 23:47.045
some of which had been compromised.

23:47.345 --> 23:50.245
I wanted to talk to him about who
he shared the information with.

23:50.345 --> 23:51.545
Yeah, he cooperate?

23:52.345 --> 23:54.545
When I called him,
he seemed preoccupied.

23:54.845 --> 23:57.745
He said he couldn't
talk. He'd get back to me.

23:58.745 --> 24:00.645
Guess that's not going to happen.

24:01.545 --> 24:02.745
This is a priority.

24:03.145 --> 24:05.145
Until we find out why he was killed,

24:05.245 --> 24:07.745
you are assigned to
Special Agent Gibbs' team.

24:11.445 --> 24:13.245
Report to the squad room at 07:30.

24:24.745 --> 24:26.545
It's a start-up bioengineering firm.

24:26.645 --> 24:27.945
$200,000 a year,

24:28.345 --> 24:29.345
stock options

24:29.645 --> 24:30.645
and a car.

24:31.345 --> 24:32.345
A car.

24:32.945 --> 24:34.445
What kind of car would Abby lease?

24:34.545 --> 24:36.945
- Another hearse?
- Guys, this is Nikki Jardine.

24:37.045 --> 24:39.545
She's an intel analyst who
had contact with Arnett.

24:39.745 --> 24:41.345
She's going to be working with us.

24:41.645 --> 24:43.045
Yes, I am still on hold.

24:43.645 --> 24:44.445
Hi.

24:44.545 --> 24:46.445
I'm Ziva David. I've seen you around.

24:48.145 --> 24:49.745
I'm sorry. I don't shake hands.

24:52.445 --> 24:54.045
I guess a hug's out of the question.

24:54.080 --> 24:55.245
Anthony DiNozzo.

24:58.745 --> 24:59.845
Behave yourself, Tony.

25:00.745 --> 25:01.545
McGee?

25:01.745 --> 25:03.645
Boss, can't find a judge
to sign the warrant.

25:03.745 --> 25:06.245
No one wants to violate the
patient-client privilege.

25:06.945 --> 25:08.545
I know we started off on the wrong foot

25:08.645 --> 25:10.645
- last night, and I just...
- You've got something?

25:11.845 --> 25:14.145
I spoke with a cryptanalyst
at the Pentagon.

25:14.245 --> 25:17.045
Lieutenant Arnett returned from
the Middle East two weeks ago.

25:17.145 --> 25:20.245
He passed through the NCIS field office
in Djibouti. With your permission,

25:20.280 --> 25:22.445
I'd like to contact the
special agent in charge there.

25:22.545 --> 25:23.545
Do it.

25:24.845 --> 25:26.445
Where are you going, Jardine?

25:27.445 --> 25:29.045
To my office to make the call.

25:32.745 --> 25:35.145
We have backgrounded
Lieutenant Arnett's family.

25:35.245 --> 25:37.745
Arnett's grandparents lived
the American dream, boss.

25:37.945 --> 25:39.545
Came to this country as teenagers.

25:39.745 --> 25:41.945
Opened a small appliance
shop in the '60s.

25:43.645 --> 25:46.045
Which evolved into a chain
of electronics stores.

25:46.345 --> 25:47.545
19, to be exact.

25:48.345 --> 25:51.745
Grossing over $250 million last year.

25:52.245 --> 25:53.645
We're talking big family money.

25:53.745 --> 25:55.445
If there's a prenup,
the soon-to-be ex-wife

25:55.645 --> 25:56.945
stands to lose a fortune.

25:57.145 --> 26:00.045
Think Black Widow, Theresa
Russell film of the same name.

26:00.245 --> 26:01.945
All right, Tony. Dana Arnett,

26:02.145 --> 26:05.045
travel agent, is a crack
shot with a sniper rifle?

26:05.245 --> 26:06.445
Could've hired a hit man.

26:06.545 --> 26:07.645
Get her in here again.

26:11.545 --> 26:12.845
I'm sorry. I have allergies.

26:18.745 --> 26:20.210
I could never wear contact lenses.

26:20.245 --> 26:22.845
Just the thought of sticking
my finger in me eye...

26:24.045 --> 26:27.345
It conforms with Lieutenant
Arnett's medical records.

26:27.645 --> 26:29.545
Near-sighted, 20/80 vision

26:29.945 --> 26:31.445
with an astigmatism.

26:31.545 --> 26:33.645
- Here are the blood samples.
- Thanks, Jimster.

26:33.745 --> 26:36.745
Expect to find Phenelzine
when you run the tox screen.

26:37.045 --> 26:38.045
Roger.

26:41.845 --> 26:43.345
- What?
- What?

26:43.745 --> 26:45.645
Am I unbuttoned or ripped?

26:45.745 --> 26:47.045
Are my ponytails crooked?

26:47.345 --> 26:49.345
Why is everyone staring at me today?

26:49.645 --> 26:50.645
I wasn't staring.

26:54.445 --> 26:57.045
- I wasn't staring.
- You were staring, Mr. Palmer.

26:57.445 --> 26:58.945
You hear about Abby's new job?

26:59.245 --> 27:01.145
Worst-kept secret at NCIS.

27:01.445 --> 27:03.945
I was told she was promised
a state-of-the-art lab,

27:04.145 --> 27:05.845
two assistants and...

27:06.545 --> 27:07.845
her own Caf-Pow machine.

27:10.945 --> 27:12.945
I spoke with Agent Wells in Djibouti.

27:13.145 --> 27:16.045
She said Lieutenant Arnett
stopped by the NCIS field office

27:16.080 --> 27:17.245
a couple of weeks ago.

27:18.345 --> 27:19.345
He was upset.

27:19.945 --> 27:22.545
He was concerned that his
key local witness was missing.

27:22.845 --> 27:24.545
They offered to help locate him, but.

27:24.645 --> 27:26.545
Arnett was so protective of his sources.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.545
He wouldn't reveal
the contact's identity.

27:28.745 --> 27:29.745
That's all?

27:30.645 --> 27:31.645
Yes.

27:36.745 --> 27:38.445
Pentagon just sent Arnett's files.

27:43.245 --> 27:45.045
Is he always this...

27:45.845 --> 27:46.845
Impatient?

27:47.545 --> 27:50.345
It's not exactly the
word I was looking for.

27:51.945 --> 27:53.645
You are not denying she's pretty.

27:54.245 --> 27:56.745
- Bizarre trumps pretty.
- But you would...

27:57.845 --> 28:00.245
- How? In a hazmat suit?
- You two would make a good couple.

28:00.280 --> 28:02.245
- You have something in common.
- What?

28:02.280 --> 28:03.110
Fear.

28:03.145 --> 28:05.645
She's afraid of germs.
You're afraid of commitment.

28:06.145 --> 28:08.045
And you're both afraid of Gibbs.

28:08.145 --> 28:09.845
For the record, Ms. David,

28:10.345 --> 28:11.645
I'm not afraid of Gibbs.

28:13.045 --> 28:15.245
Thank you for coming
back in, Mrs. Arnett.

28:15.745 --> 28:16.745
You have news?

28:17.245 --> 28:18.245
Sorry, no.

28:19.145 --> 28:20.245
So why am I here?

28:20.645 --> 28:23.445
This will not take long. We
just need to clarify something.

28:24.945 --> 28:27.145
The circumstances under
which you got married.

28:28.445 --> 28:29.510
What does that mean?

28:29.545 --> 28:31.445
Your husband's family
is worth a lot of money.

28:31.845 --> 28:34.245
You didn't by any chance
sign a prenup, did you?

28:36.545 --> 28:39.745
My husband attempted to take his
own life and then was murdered.

28:40.145 --> 28:42.545
He hasn't even been dead 48
hours and you have the nerve

28:42.745 --> 28:45.545
to stand here and ask me how
much money I may or may not get?

28:46.645 --> 28:48.445
Michael's parents are arriving and...

28:48.945 --> 28:50.545
I have a funeral to arrange.

28:53.345 --> 28:55.945
Do I need someone to escort
me out of the building?

28:56.045 --> 28:58.245
I will escort you, Mrs. Arnett.

29:02.845 --> 29:04.045
Nice, Tony.

29:04.245 --> 29:05.245
"Black Widow".

29:05.645 --> 29:06.410
Guilty.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.545
When there's money involved,
it's always the spouse.

29:14.945 --> 29:16.045
Roll call.

29:16.145 --> 29:18.745
Phenelzine is present and
accounted for, as predicted,

29:18.845 --> 29:21.245
but Timolol made a surprise appearance.

29:21.445 --> 29:22.445
Timolol?

29:22.545 --> 29:24.045
A very high concentration.

29:24.445 --> 29:26.245
- Timolol?
- It's a beta-blocker.

29:26.345 --> 29:28.745
Eye drops. Used to treat glaucoma.

29:29.345 --> 29:32.845
Which, according to his medical
records, Lieutenant Arnett never had.

29:33.945 --> 29:34.945
Mr. Palmer,

29:35.445 --> 29:37.445
have the lieutenant
report back to the table.

29:37.745 --> 29:38.745
Yes, sir.

29:43.045 --> 29:43.845
Boss,

29:44.045 --> 29:45.445
I vetted Dr. Fleming.

29:48.345 --> 29:52.245
Turns out he was a radical undergraduate
at Berkeley in the early '70s.

29:52.345 --> 29:54.945
Arrested several times
for civil disobedience.

29:55.045 --> 29:58.545
As recently as last week, spoke at
a Get-Out-of-Gitmo rally on the Mall.

29:59.445 --> 30:02.145
Well, bring him in. We don't
need a subpoena to interview him.

30:02.445 --> 30:04.845
Captain Walsh is online in MTAC.

30:05.545 --> 30:06.845
Arnett's files.

30:07.145 --> 30:09.145
Redacted to the point it's useless.

30:09.345 --> 30:11.645
Special Agent Gibbs, I've got something.

30:12.945 --> 30:13.945
Yes, sir.

30:16.045 --> 30:17.145
Captain Walsh,

30:17.545 --> 30:18.845
sorry to keep you waiting.

30:19.245 --> 30:20.510
My unit's still on lockdown.

30:20.545 --> 30:22.745
You were supposed to keep
me in the loop, Agent Gibbs.

30:22.780 --> 30:24.145
Lieutenant Arnett's file...

30:24.245 --> 30:26.245
I could've got more
reading The Washington Post.

30:26.345 --> 30:28.110
Blame the Director of
National Intelligence.

30:28.145 --> 30:31.945
And you forgot to mention Arnett
was questioned about leaked intel.

30:32.545 --> 30:35.545
Didn't think I needed to. Don't you
people at NCIS talk to each other?

30:36.345 --> 30:37.445
Captain Walsh,

30:37.945 --> 30:41.345
in order for this agency to
complete a thorough investigation,

30:41.380 --> 30:43.345
we will need your full cooperation.

30:43.645 --> 30:45.645
You'll be briefed when
we think it's appropriate.

30:46.045 --> 30:48.545
I have a meeting with the
Undersecretary in half an hour.

30:48.580 --> 30:49.645
What do I tell him?

30:50.045 --> 30:52.045
Tell him the Director of
National Intelligence is

30:52.080 --> 30:53.845
obstructing our investigation.

30:57.245 --> 30:58.745
Djibouti's coming online.

30:59.245 --> 31:00.645
Satellite time's expensive.

31:03.545 --> 31:05.745
What do you have for
us, Special Agent Wells?

31:05.845 --> 31:07.345
We've been working with Bahrain.

31:07.445 --> 31:09.045
I think we've come up with something.

31:09.245 --> 31:12.545
A tribal leader was beheaded for
collaborating with an American agent.

31:12.845 --> 31:15.045
It's definitely the work
of Al-Qaeda operatives.

31:15.245 --> 31:16.745
We have every reason to believe

31:16.945 --> 31:19.845
the victim was Lieutenant
Arnett's missing contact.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.045
When did it happen?

31:21.145 --> 31:22.810
A couple days ago, not too much longer.

31:22.845 --> 31:25.045
We're just getting into
it questioning villagers.

31:25.345 --> 31:26.945
I want updates as you get them.

31:26.980 --> 31:27.980
Yes, ma'am.

31:29.745 --> 31:31.045
What've you got, Jardine?

31:31.245 --> 31:32.245
I did a matrix.

31:32.445 --> 31:34.345
Focused on the four most recent leaks.

31:34.545 --> 31:36.945
Charted who generated the
information, received it,

31:36.980 --> 31:39.045
or had access to it,
directly or indirectly.

31:39.145 --> 31:40.710
The only person who had knowledge

31:40.745 --> 31:43.645
of all the leaked intel was
Lieutenant Arnett himself.

31:43.745 --> 31:46.545
If the beheaded tribal
leader was in fact his source

31:46.745 --> 31:48.345
and his identity has been leaked,

31:48.445 --> 31:50.445
then Arnett is the only
one who would have known.

31:51.445 --> 31:53.445
I think Lieutenant Arnett was the mole.

32:01.145 --> 32:02.445
Mid-Eastern ancestry.

32:02.645 --> 32:03.745
Arab-speaking.

32:03.845 --> 32:05.410
Naval Academy graduate.

32:05.445 --> 32:07.245
Intelligence officer in the Pentagon.

32:07.445 --> 32:09.545
He is the perfect deep cover mole.

32:09.845 --> 32:12.545
Sort of an Arab version of
Kevin Costner in No Way Out.

32:13.245 --> 32:15.645
A movie buff. One more
thing you two have in common.

32:15.745 --> 32:17.310
Arnett's juggling two lives.

32:17.345 --> 32:20.145
Things are closing in on
him. He's stressed to the max.

32:20.180 --> 32:22.945
On antidepressants, a liability
to his Al-Qaeda handlers.

32:23.045 --> 32:24.345
When he doesn't jump,

32:24.545 --> 32:27.245
they terminate him before
he can expose their cell.

32:27.280 --> 32:28.545
Nah, I still like the...

32:28.845 --> 32:30.645
wife. Had him killed for the money.

32:30.680 --> 32:31.610
There's a prenup.

32:31.645 --> 32:33.945
He dies before they get
divorced, she gets the big check.

32:34.145 --> 32:35.545
If he died after, she gets zip.

32:35.645 --> 32:37.545
Yeah, why the suicide attempt, DiNozzo?

32:38.645 --> 32:40.145
I'm still working on that part, boss.

32:40.245 --> 32:41.645
We know why he was suicidal.

32:41.745 --> 32:44.845
Abby found Timolol in
Lieutenant Arnett's blood.

32:45.045 --> 32:47.045
It's used to treat glaucoma.

32:47.245 --> 32:48.745
He didn't have glaucoma.

32:49.145 --> 32:51.245
- So why'd he take it?
- Well, that's the best part.

32:51.445 --> 32:52.645
He didn't know he was.

32:52.945 --> 32:56.645
Someone substituted Timolol
for his contact lens solution.

32:56.845 --> 32:58.545
His lenses were soaking in it all night.

32:58.645 --> 33:01.645
It's the equivalent of wearing
nicotine patches on his eyes.

33:01.945 --> 33:05.545
The level of the drug was 20
times the recommended dosage.

33:05.645 --> 33:07.345
I still haven't heard
why he was suicidal.

33:07.445 --> 33:10.310
Because the combination
of the eye medication

33:10.345 --> 33:14.145
and the antidepressant he was
taking has a serious side effect:

33:14.245 --> 33:16.245
Severe clinical depression.

33:16.745 --> 33:18.945
Well, I think you're
overlooking an obvious character.

33:19.345 --> 33:20.345
Character?

33:21.745 --> 33:24.045
This isn't one of your
novels, Mr. Gemcity.

33:24.745 --> 33:25.745
Dr. Fleming

33:26.145 --> 33:27.745
has anti-government leanings.

33:27.780 --> 33:29.345
He prescribed the antidepressant

33:29.445 --> 33:31.345
and would know the
combined drugs side effects.

33:31.380 --> 33:33.110
If Arnett discussed
classified information

33:33.145 --> 33:35.845
during their sessions, Fleming
could have passed the intel on.

33:36.545 --> 33:37.645
There's your spy.

33:38.745 --> 33:39.745
Yes, probie,

33:39.845 --> 33:41.945
but the wife had access
to the contact lenses.

33:41.980 --> 33:43.145
That does not prove anything.

33:43.245 --> 33:46.645
McGee found a bottle of lens solution
in Arnett's Pentagon office desk.

33:46.845 --> 33:49.945
- Your point?
- Captain Walsh had access to his desk,

33:50.045 --> 33:52.645
and, as Arnett's CO,
knowledge of his intel.

33:52.845 --> 33:55.945
- That's the weakest point of all.
- All these make more sense than Arnett.

33:55.980 --> 33:58.845
Listen, I think I'm not
missing the point. I think...

34:01.845 --> 34:04.545
Break up the dog pile. This
is a murder investigation.

34:04.645 --> 34:07.545
And I am hearing a lot of
theories here and not much else.

34:07.845 --> 34:08.844
Get on it!

34:15.145 --> 34:17.344
So, I'm against the
war and the Patriot Act.

34:17.844 --> 34:19.145
Doesn't make me un-American.

34:23.145 --> 34:24.344
What have you got there?

34:25.045 --> 34:26.645
Government keeping a file on me?

34:26.844 --> 34:28.645
I'll ask the questions, Dr. Fleming.

34:31.645 --> 34:32.844
I've had enough of this.

34:33.545 --> 34:34.545
Sit down!

34:38.344 --> 34:40.545
I see McGee's got your mad act down.

34:41.145 --> 34:42.145
Almost.

34:43.445 --> 34:46.045
I heard your agents are
pitted against each other.

34:46.344 --> 34:49.645
Wasn't that Gibbs' rule
#15: "Always work as a team"?

34:50.645 --> 34:51.645
Not on this one.

34:57.145 --> 34:58.745
No one could have saved him, Jethro.

35:01.045 --> 35:03.445
He was dead the moment he
stepped out on that ledge.

35:05.745 --> 35:07.245
That what I tell his sister?

35:13.445 --> 35:14.645
You have any luck?

35:14.680 --> 35:15.845
Might be something.

35:16.145 --> 35:18.145
The summer before his
junior year in high school,

35:18.245 --> 35:20.545
he spent two months in
Damascus with relatives.

35:21.245 --> 35:23.110
I'm trying to ascertain their politics.

35:23.145 --> 35:26.545
- Entrapped the "Black Widow" yet?
- Minor setback.

35:26.845 --> 35:29.145
I thought since Dana
Arnett was married to a guy

35:29.245 --> 35:31.645
with top-secret clearance,
she would have been vetted.

35:31.845 --> 35:32.845
Let me guess.

35:32.945 --> 35:34.045
She's squeaky clean.

35:34.145 --> 35:36.345
Well, I don't know because
she was never checked out.

35:36.380 --> 35:38.045
If he'd married some foreigner, then,

35:38.145 --> 35:41.345
obviously, she would have been
subjected to a vigorous background check,

35:41.380 --> 35:43.310
but she was born in Kansas.

35:43.345 --> 35:45.945
I am having the same problem
McGee had with Captain Walsh.

35:45.980 --> 35:47.945
The Pentagon is rock-walling me.

35:48.645 --> 35:49.945
She means stonewalling.

35:50.245 --> 35:51.445
Little quirk she has.

35:52.345 --> 35:54.245
I guess everyone has
their little quirks,

35:54.445 --> 35:55.445
even me.

35:56.845 --> 35:57.845
Really?

35:58.145 --> 35:59.145
I hadn't noticed.

36:05.245 --> 36:08.245
Abby, please. All I'm asking
is for you to take another look

36:08.280 --> 36:09.945
at the hard drive on Arnett's computer.

36:10.145 --> 36:11.145
It's wiped clean.

36:11.645 --> 36:13.645
Maybe you can find an
embedded file, anything.

36:13.745 --> 36:15.845
I can't, okay? I am too busy.

36:15.945 --> 36:18.095
Why don't you ask McGee
to do it? Because Mr. MIT

36:18.130 --> 36:20.245
claims that he's better
at this stuff anyways.

36:28.145 --> 36:29.445
May I take a couple of these?

36:29.745 --> 36:31.045
Sure, knock yourself out.

36:32.645 --> 36:34.510
- Abs?
- McGee, I need your help.

36:34.545 --> 36:36.710
I got Dr. Fleming's fingerprints
on this water bottle.

36:36.745 --> 36:39.245
I need you to compare it to the
prints lifted in Arnett's flat.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.310
Take a number, because
Tony has me running DNA

36:41.345 --> 36:43.545
off this toothbrush with an
entire database of felons.

36:43.645 --> 36:45.645
- It'll only take a minute.
- I asked first.

36:46.445 --> 36:48.045
- I did. I've got seniority.
- Yes...

36:48.745 --> 36:49.745
Back off!

36:49.845 --> 36:51.745
All of you, okay? I am one person!

36:52.245 --> 36:54.310
- Easy, Abs.
- No! It's late.

36:54.345 --> 36:57.045
I am tired, I am overworked,
and I am taken for granted!

37:02.045 --> 37:03.745
Maybe you should accept that job offer.

37:13.145 --> 37:15.045
I can't believe you'd
say that to me, Gibbs.

37:15.645 --> 37:17.445
How could you think
that I would be leaving?

37:17.645 --> 37:18.945
'Cause I got a little mad?

37:19.445 --> 37:20.445
So what?

37:21.045 --> 37:22.445
We're family. That's allowed.

37:22.845 --> 37:24.845
I get three or four
job offers every year.

37:25.145 --> 37:26.645
I've never considered any of them.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.245
Then why'd you have dinner
with that headhunter?

37:30.845 --> 37:33.845
Have you ever had the Beluga
caviar at the Ritz-Carlton?

37:35.445 --> 37:36.445
And besides,

37:36.645 --> 37:38.045
it was nice to feel wanted.

37:38.345 --> 37:40.645
Now, get out of here, all
of you. I have work to do.

37:43.845 --> 37:45.545
- What was that for?
- Spreading rumors.

37:46.645 --> 37:48.545
- Thank you, boss.
- DiNozzo!

37:49.145 --> 37:50.145
Get back in here!

37:51.245 --> 37:52.545
Anyone wanna come with me?

37:54.845 --> 37:57.445
I am meeting Captain Walsh's
former executive officer

37:57.545 --> 37:59.945
at the Naval Amphibious Base
at Little Creek tomorrow.

38:00.145 --> 38:03.045
He is willing to talk to us,
off the record, but not here.

38:03.245 --> 38:04.745
You losers might want to follow me.

38:04.780 --> 38:05.910
Boss, need you in MTAC.

38:05.945 --> 38:08.345
Clearly, you're not one of
the losers. My hunch paid off.

38:08.380 --> 38:10.245
Figured the "Black Widow"
has a felony record.

38:10.280 --> 38:11.945
Abby just got a DNA match from Interpol.

38:13.045 --> 38:15.245
Her real name is Najida Mamud,

38:15.545 --> 38:17.545
an agent of the Syrian Mukhabarat.

38:17.645 --> 38:20.145
She's a gifted linguist,
she was educated in England,

38:20.245 --> 38:24.045
and secretly trained in weaponry,
martial arts and covert operations.

38:24.345 --> 38:25.345
Ziva, she's you.

38:25.945 --> 38:28.845
Najida Mamud was in an
Al-Qaeda camp in Sudan

38:28.945 --> 38:31.345
until we lost track
of her three years ago.

38:31.645 --> 38:33.210
We thought she was in Pakistan.

38:33.245 --> 38:35.045
She was obviously smuggled into the US

38:35.145 --> 38:38.045
and then deep-backstopped
with impeccable American ID.

38:38.445 --> 38:40.845
- Homeland Security's worst fear.
- And ours.

38:41.345 --> 38:42.845
Let me know if you apprehend her.

38:43.745 --> 38:47.245
Lieutenant Arnett didn't casually
meet his wife at a museum.

38:47.345 --> 38:48.445
She set him up,

38:48.745 --> 38:51.145
just like Kathleen Turner set
up William Hurt in Body Heat.

38:51.180 --> 38:52.845
Lieutenant Arnett wasn't the mole.

38:53.145 --> 38:54.645
He was married to the mole.

38:55.545 --> 38:57.710
How did she know he was
going to jump off a building?

38:57.745 --> 39:00.545
Didn't. She was drugging him,
building a case for his depression.

39:00.580 --> 39:02.745
So when she killed him...
overdose, slit his wrists,

39:02.780 --> 39:04.321
whatever, it would appear to be suicide.

39:04.345 --> 39:06.410
He must have realized he
was the source of the leak

39:06.445 --> 39:08.745
- that got his operative killed.
- Reason enough to jump?

39:09.145 --> 39:11.010
Guess when we got
involved, she had no choice.

39:11.045 --> 39:14.245
Had to take him out. I'm gonna put
out a BOLO, notify Homeland Security.

39:14.280 --> 39:16.045
I will call the hotel,
see if she's there.

39:16.080 --> 39:17.345
I'm getting the car, boss.

39:17.745 --> 39:18.745
What can I do?

39:19.645 --> 39:20.745
Assignment's over.

39:31.345 --> 39:32.945
You can get me that phone number.

39:39.145 --> 39:41.945
Dana Arnett notified the front
desk that she is checking out.

39:46.645 --> 39:48.645
She left the lobby
less than a minute ago.

39:48.845 --> 39:51.345
DiNozzo, McGee, start at
the top, work your way down.

40:13.845 --> 40:14.845
Federal agents.

40:15.545 --> 40:16.545
Keep moving.

40:31.145 --> 40:32.145
Boss!

40:33.245 --> 40:34.445
Pull the fire alarm!

40:34.645 --> 40:36.045
McGee, level seven.

40:51.645 --> 40:52.645
Probie!

40:56.545 --> 40:58.045
This is not how I want it to end!

40:58.145 --> 40:59.745
Hang on, Tony. I'm coming.

41:22.645 --> 41:23.745
Give me an excuse.

41:29.645 --> 41:30.845
It's about time!

41:32.745 --> 41:33.845
Come on.

41:42.645 --> 41:43.845
I love you, McGee.

41:46.645 --> 41:49.345
I promise never to give
you a hard time again.

41:50.045 --> 41:51.045
Yeah, right.

41:57.345 --> 41:58.345
Where's Gibbs?

41:58.845 --> 42:00.045
I don't know.

42:00.245 --> 42:02.345
Is that what you get for
turning down the job offer?

42:02.845 --> 42:04.845
No. For solving the case.

42:05.545 --> 42:08.245
I believe those are for me,
then, because I solved the case.

42:09.345 --> 42:12.845
But Abby ran the photo-recognition
that ID'd Lieutenant Arnett.

42:12.945 --> 42:14.745
I risked my life hanging off a wall.

42:14.845 --> 42:18.445
She discovered the drug interaction
that made Arnett suicidal.

42:18.545 --> 42:20.545
I suggested we run the wife's DNA.

42:20.645 --> 42:23.245
Against a national database of felons.

42:23.545 --> 42:27.245
Dead end. Abby went the extra step and
compared it to the Interpol database.

42:27.345 --> 42:28.445
I don't believe this.

42:28.945 --> 42:30.045
He still loves me.

42:31.245 --> 42:32.245
Give it up, Tony.

42:32.445 --> 42:34.045
She will always be the favorite, Tony.

42:39.245 --> 42:40.245
I still love you.

42:44.145 --> 42:45.145
Back to work.

42:49.845 --> 42:50.845
Agent Gibbs?

42:52.045 --> 42:53.345
That phone number you wanted.

42:59.845 --> 43:02.145
That's good work, Jardine. Good night.

43:19.345 --> 43:20.345
Hello?

43:20.745 --> 43:22.145
Hello. Rachel?

43:22.545 --> 43:24.045
Yes, this is Rachel.

43:25.845 --> 43:26.845
We haven't met...

43:29.345 --> 43:30.545
but I knew your brother.
