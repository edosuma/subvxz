00:04.047 --> 00:05.135
Previously onSEAL Team...

00:05.179 --> 00:06.267
Ray, that's Mandy.

00:06.310 --> 00:07.311
In the SGS custody?

00:07.355 --> 00:08.617
JASON:
We got to do something.

00:11.141 --> 00:14.666
[grunts] Tell me where he is.
You got 20 seconds.

00:14.710 --> 00:17.321
RAY:
Letting a terrorist loose
on some desperate long shot?

00:17.365 --> 00:19.106
That something could get us
kicked from the teams, Jace.

00:19.149 --> 00:21.151
Mandy needs our help.

00:21.195 --> 00:23.501
[grunting]

00:23.545 --> 00:25.068
-[gunshots]
-Don't shoot!

00:25.112 --> 00:27.027
-Mandy.
-SONNY: Something up with Ash?

00:27.070 --> 00:29.029
-Cancer.
-But having lost my mother,

00:29.072 --> 00:31.422
I would do anything just to get
one more day with her.

00:31.466 --> 00:33.685
-Stella's pregnant.
-[chuckles] I knew
you could do it.

00:33.729 --> 00:36.645
Hoping your new DoD Fellowship
will open up some new doors.

00:36.688 --> 00:38.516
DAVIS:
I'm just broadening my horizons.

00:44.305 --> 00:46.133
[door closes]

00:47.177 --> 00:48.265
You're late.

00:48.309 --> 00:50.180
Worried I'd changed my mind?

00:50.224 --> 00:53.053
No, I was just worried
that you got lost.

00:53.096 --> 00:55.272
Well, fortunately for me,

00:55.316 --> 00:58.058
GPS works in Delaware.

00:58.101 --> 01:02.540
♪ Stay while I rebuild the world

01:02.584 --> 01:06.109

01:31.700 --> 01:34.137
-This was a good idea.
-JASON: Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:34.181 --> 01:37.227
It was. It was
one of my better ones, huh?

01:37.271 --> 01:39.490
I'm glad you were free
this weekend.

01:39.534 --> 01:41.840
Here. I'm glad you called.

01:41.884 --> 01:44.408
Even though it took a month.

01:44.452 --> 01:46.584
So, did you, uh...

01:46.628 --> 01:48.586
did you get in trouble
with the Agency?

01:48.630 --> 01:51.415
-That's what you're thinking
about right now?
-Well, as a friend,

01:51.459 --> 01:53.591
I'm just genuinely concerned.
That's all.

01:53.635 --> 01:56.246
-A friend.
-Yeah.

01:56.290 --> 01:58.683
All right, buddy.

01:58.727 --> 02:00.120
Buddy. [chuckles]

02:00.163 --> 02:01.512
[chuckles softly]

02:01.556 --> 02:03.384
Well, um...

02:03.427 --> 02:05.342
I'm out of the Agency,

02:05.386 --> 02:07.214
so what they think
doesn't matter to me.

02:07.257 --> 02:10.260
You experiencing
something like that, uh,

02:10.304 --> 02:13.133
definitely can, uh...

02:13.176 --> 02:17.137
make things shaky, right?

02:17.180 --> 02:20.444
The reentry process.
Was it bumpy?

02:20.488 --> 02:24.622
I made a choice
to step back into that world,

02:24.666 --> 02:27.495
and I paid the price. But...

02:27.538 --> 02:29.671
[sighs]

02:29.714 --> 02:31.629
It's not my first rodeo.

02:31.673 --> 02:33.892
-Not my first kidnapping, even.
-Mm.

02:33.936 --> 02:36.199
I know sharking when I hear it.

02:36.243 --> 02:37.331
-Whoa. [chuckles]
-[chuckles]

02:37.374 --> 02:38.810
That's a compliment

02:38.854 --> 02:41.422
coming from
Mr. Ignore and Override.

02:41.465 --> 02:44.207
-What can I tell you?
I've evolved.
-Mm-hmm.

02:44.251 --> 02:46.731
That's why we're hanging out
here in Rehoboth

02:46.775 --> 02:48.907
instead of Vah Beach.

02:52.607 --> 02:54.913
Ooh, I forgot to tell you
that I, uh, spoke

02:54.957 --> 02:56.654
with Dr. McKenna's office,

02:56.698 --> 02:58.830
and she said
that she can fit us in

02:58.874 --> 03:01.181
Thursday instead of Friday.

03:01.224 --> 03:02.530
You know, this is a...

03:02.573 --> 03:04.662
It's a pretty big appointment.

03:04.706 --> 03:07.361
She'll tell us the sex
if we want to know.

03:07.404 --> 03:09.885
[chuckles] Well, don't
we pretty much know anyway?

03:09.928 --> 03:14.237
I mean, Emma. Jameelah. Leanne.

03:14.281 --> 03:15.282
Having a daughter
as the first child

03:15.325 --> 03:17.501
seems to be the frogman way.

03:17.545 --> 03:19.373
Yeah.

03:19.416 --> 03:22.202
Well, little girl's probably
easier than a boy, anyways.

03:22.245 --> 03:24.900
[laughs] Said no mother ever.

03:24.943 --> 03:26.902
It's the frogman way.

03:26.945 --> 03:29.252
Fathers and sons
tend to be messy.

03:30.949 --> 03:34.388
Is our little run-in with Ash
still weighing on you?

03:34.431 --> 03:37.217
More of an ambush than run-in.

03:37.260 --> 03:39.828
Well, Ash is always working
some angle.

03:39.871 --> 03:41.873
Just can't figure out
what this one is.

03:43.527 --> 03:44.876
I mean...

03:46.878 --> 03:48.880
Why tell me
that he might be dying

03:48.924 --> 03:50.708
and then just ghost me again?

03:50.752 --> 03:53.929
Maybe because he came
extending an olive branch

03:53.972 --> 03:56.801
that you, uh,
snapped over your knee.

03:56.845 --> 03:58.586
Repeatedly.

04:01.632 --> 04:03.982
I mean, have you even tried
reaching out to him?

04:06.811 --> 04:08.770
Then who's ghosting who?

04:14.558 --> 04:16.908
I told you
two scoops wasn't too many.

04:16.952 --> 04:19.563
How come you got a cup?

04:19.607 --> 04:21.565
That's why.
[chuckles]

04:21.609 --> 04:22.958
Because you're messy.

04:24.307 --> 04:25.961
Knucklehead.

04:43.370 --> 04:44.936
Can I help you?

04:44.980 --> 04:47.330
Just brightening her day.

04:48.418 --> 04:51.291
-Our day's
already bright, thanks.
-That's hers.

04:51.334 --> 04:53.641
Not mine. Not yours.

04:57.384 --> 04:58.820
Want a few bucks?

04:58.863 --> 05:00.691
I didn't ask for that.

05:00.735 --> 05:02.606
Then my daughter and I
are gonna continue walking.

05:02.650 --> 05:04.695
Appreciate you letting us by.

05:25.020 --> 05:27.718
You okay, sweetheart?

05:27.762 --> 05:29.720
What'd he say to you?

05:29.764 --> 05:31.374
He said he liked my hat.

05:31.418 --> 05:34.029
Said he used to be
in the Navy, too.

05:34.072 --> 05:35.552
Oh, did he?

05:38.599 --> 05:40.122
JAMEELAH:
How is that true?

05:41.428 --> 05:44.518
If he was in the Navy,
why is he living there?

05:44.561 --> 05:46.346
It's hard to say, baby.

05:46.389 --> 05:49.436
Your and Mom's jobs
are to help people, right?

05:49.479 --> 05:50.567
Yeah.

05:50.611 --> 05:51.960
Can't you help him?

05:53.962 --> 05:55.746
You know what,
let's talk about it with Mommy

05:55.790 --> 05:56.878
when we get home, okay?

05:56.921 --> 05:59.097
Come on, monkey. Come on.

05:59.141 --> 06:02.013
Oh. Oh, there we go.
[exhales]

06:02.057 --> 06:04.625
So, uh, your flight was okay?

06:04.668 --> 06:07.018
-Uh, yeah? She, uh...
-Yeah.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.368
Little munchkin
didn't cry too much

06:08.411 --> 06:10.370
and, uh, piss off
some of the passengers?

06:10.413 --> 06:13.024
Emmit gave me your grandninny's
Cowboy Cookie recipe.

06:13.068 --> 06:15.853
I took a batch on board.
Bribed the other passengers

06:15.897 --> 06:18.508
-into liking her.
-Oh, yeah?

06:18.552 --> 06:20.075
-Did you save some for Daddy?
-[baby talk]: "Sorry, Daddy.

06:20.118 --> 06:22.991
I screamed like an asshole.
Needed a lot of bribes."

06:23.034 --> 06:25.036
Oh, really?
After I went to Costco

06:25.080 --> 06:27.604
and cleared out
all the Cheerios for you?

06:27.648 --> 06:29.127
And I, uh,

06:29.171 --> 06:31.086
I got a bunch
of different pureed vegetables

06:31.129 --> 06:33.044
for her, as well.

06:33.088 --> 06:35.395
It's quite the artisanal racket
they got going on there.

06:35.438 --> 06:36.526
[chuckles]:
Yeah.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.006
SONNY:
All right, here you go.

06:38.049 --> 06:40.443
I guess...
Well, you're sleeping,

06:40.487 --> 06:42.706
-but this is your...
this is your new room.
-[chuckles]

06:42.750 --> 06:44.839
You can take the bed.
I'm gonna be out on the couch.

06:45.883 --> 06:48.973
Oh, and I-I got you a...
I got you this, uh...

06:49.017 --> 06:52.716
-It's like a massage pad thing.
-Mm-hmm.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.718
I-I just thought, you know,
with the plane and everything,

06:54.762 --> 06:55.980
might have done a number
on your back.

06:56.024 --> 06:58.722
Aw, you're a big-box store's
wet dream.

06:58.766 --> 07:00.985
A small price to pay
for you, uh,

07:01.029 --> 07:02.900
getting this little munchkin
up here.

07:02.944 --> 07:05.729
Few dicey FaceTimes there
had me worried about you.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.992
[sighs]
Yeah. You know, it can...

07:08.036 --> 07:10.821
get a little squirrelly
inside the wire.

07:10.865 --> 07:13.650
Being away from my little girl.

07:13.694 --> 07:15.696
Oh, uh, uh, Ray was gonna have

07:15.739 --> 07:17.001
a little get-together,
um, tomorrow,

07:17.045 --> 07:20.135
and, uh, I was just thinking
it'd be cool to...

07:20.178 --> 07:24.052
you know, like,
introduce her to all the guys.

07:24.095 --> 07:26.968
-And, you know,
if you need more time to...
-No, tomorrow's fine.

07:27.011 --> 07:28.796
Sounds fun.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.103
-Last one. Get it in there.
-[chuckles]

07:32.147 --> 07:35.455
Mm-hmm.
[exhales]

07:35.498 --> 07:37.500
Gonna eat that last fry there?

07:37.544 --> 07:38.588
-This one here?
-Yeah, that one.

07:38.632 --> 07:39.850
-Would you...
-Yeah, sure.

07:39.894 --> 07:42.505
Oh. [chuckles]
You got a healthy appetite.

07:42.549 --> 07:46.466
-[chuckles] Better be
complimenting your own prowess.
-Wow.

07:46.509 --> 07:47.597
-Interesting.
-[phone vibrating]

07:47.641 --> 07:48.903
Oh, God.

07:49.947 --> 07:52.167
Just when we were hitting
our stride.

07:52.210 --> 07:53.516
JASON:
Yeah.

07:54.865 --> 07:57.520
It's not Command.
It's, uh, it's Ray.

07:58.869 --> 08:01.655
Sonny's, uh, kid is in town.

08:01.698 --> 08:02.960
There's a party
to meet her tomorrow.

08:03.004 --> 08:05.485
God, Sonny's a dad.

08:05.528 --> 08:07.138
What's that like?

08:07.182 --> 08:08.836
Why don't you find out
for yourself.

08:08.879 --> 08:12.535
Isn't there a reason
we're in Rehoboth?

08:13.928 --> 08:17.061
I mean, us arriving together
invites a lot of eyes.

08:17.105 --> 08:18.628
I got a great idea.

08:18.672 --> 08:20.804
Why don't we arrive separately.
[chuckles]

08:20.848 --> 08:22.545
[chuckles]

08:23.590 --> 08:25.635
So, the last time we did this

08:25.679 --> 08:26.984
in J-Bad,

08:27.028 --> 08:29.552
neither of us was
in a very good place.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.728
This is not that.

08:32.729 --> 08:34.644
Okay.

08:34.688 --> 08:36.646
Yeah.

08:36.690 --> 08:40.084
It isn't. Good.
We're on the same page.

08:40.128 --> 08:43.784
We're just two friends...

08:43.827 --> 08:46.003
-Wearing robes. [chuckles]
-[chuckles]

08:46.047 --> 08:49.703
-Celebrating
my daring rescue of you.
-It's a shame

08:49.746 --> 08:52.096
Brock wasn't the first one
through that door.

08:55.578 --> 08:57.275
[both chuckle]

09:08.243 --> 09:10.245
[indistinct chatter]

09:12.247 --> 09:14.249
[coughing]

09:24.912 --> 09:27.871
This is
where you wanted to meet?

09:27.915 --> 09:30.265
You kidding me?
It's safer than the coffee shop.

09:30.308 --> 09:32.876
Nurses can shield me
from your haymakers.

09:32.920 --> 09:35.052
[Ash chuckles]

09:35.096 --> 09:37.707
Well, sit down.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.974
Not a friendly visit, huh?

09:45.976 --> 09:48.326
I just, uh...

09:49.676 --> 09:51.634
I want to know
what's going on with you.

09:55.986 --> 09:58.772
You want to know
what's landed me in this chair

09:58.815 --> 10:01.731
with a needle in my chest?
[exhales]

10:01.775 --> 10:05.343
I could tell you,
but you would just google it.

10:05.387 --> 10:07.607
If you don't tell me,
I'll just ask the front desk.

10:07.650 --> 10:10.348
Too bad you're not on the
approved list of close contacts

10:10.392 --> 10:12.742
for my doctor to talk to
about me.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.831
What close contacts?

10:14.875 --> 10:16.877
[laughing]

10:23.187 --> 10:24.841
Shit.

10:26.190 --> 10:29.193
[sighs]

10:31.195 --> 10:32.849
Ewing's sarcoma.

10:34.155 --> 10:37.027
Chemo's just the opening salvo.

10:37.071 --> 10:39.726
Soften up the tumors.

10:41.728 --> 10:45.122
Then assault via radiation
or surgery.

10:46.167 --> 10:48.038
You don't know which?

10:48.082 --> 10:49.649
Nah.

10:49.692 --> 10:52.652
If this doesn't work,
then neither.

10:54.349 --> 10:57.221
What are the chances
that it doesn't work?

10:57.265 --> 11:00.007
I didn't ask.

11:00.050 --> 11:01.312
Why wouldn't you ask?

11:01.356 --> 11:03.750
"Never tell me the odds."

11:03.793 --> 11:05.752
[chuckling]

11:06.840 --> 11:08.406
This isn't piloting
the Millennium Falcon

11:08.450 --> 11:10.713
through an asteroid field.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.759
This is your life.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.891
That's right.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.371
It's my life.

11:16.414 --> 11:18.025
My terms, Clay.

11:18.068 --> 11:20.418
I don't need you just poking
your nose around my business.

11:20.462 --> 11:21.855
[scoffs]

11:21.898 --> 11:23.770
Then why'd you track me down
at the coffee shop?

11:33.040 --> 11:35.738
Clay, just...

11:35.782 --> 11:38.393
Come on, you drove
all the way up here. Just stay.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.181
I got better things to do

11:44.225 --> 11:45.879
than fight with a sick guy.

11:50.884 --> 11:53.060
That's a low blow, Clay.

11:59.109 --> 12:00.850
JAMEELAH:
She's cute.

12:00.894 --> 12:03.026
Doesn't look a lot like you,
Uncle Sonny.

12:03.070 --> 12:04.332
[all laugh]

12:04.375 --> 12:07.378
Resemblance is strongest
in her poopy-face.

12:07.422 --> 12:08.728
You burn Sonny any harder,

12:08.771 --> 12:10.730
-he's gonna be like his tri-tip.
-SONNY: Oh.

12:10.773 --> 12:12.775
You can make fun of my looks
all you want,

12:12.819 --> 12:15.822
but don't you dare
come after my meat.

12:15.865 --> 12:18.738
Don't worry, man.
Your meat is safe.

12:18.781 --> 12:20.783
-[all laugh]
-SONNY: That's a good thing.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.785
From everyone,
if the rumors are true.

12:22.829 --> 12:25.222
-SONNY: They are true.
-[laughs]
-RAY: Hey.

12:25.266 --> 12:29.096
What's got you all lit up?
Can't be that watered-down beer.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.839
-BROCK: Look who's here.
-Hi.

12:32.882 --> 12:34.754
RAY:
Mandy? Oh,

12:34.797 --> 12:37.278
well, this is unexpected,
honey. Uh...

12:37.321 --> 12:40.020
I was in Langley answering some
questions about Burkina Faso.

12:40.063 --> 12:42.500
I told Jason I was thinking
of swinging through

12:42.544 --> 12:44.241
to say hello.
He told me to come here.

12:44.285 --> 12:47.767
-NAIMA: Glad you did.
-Whatever you say, spook.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.246
[chuckles]

12:49.290 --> 12:51.509
[Mandy chuckles]

12:51.553 --> 12:53.816
Grant, I just sent you a link.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.426
De La Soul tickets?

12:55.470 --> 12:57.994
At the Kennedy Center.

12:58.038 --> 12:59.517
[both chuckle]

12:59.561 --> 13:01.171
Look, I mean, you've been
driving down here for a month,

13:01.215 --> 13:04.218
so we should probably hang out
in your neck of the woods.

13:04.261 --> 13:06.873
The drive's gotten easier since
I started taking a layover.

13:06.916 --> 13:09.005
I'm glad
that I can help break up

13:09.049 --> 13:10.441
the monotony of the road
for you.

13:10.485 --> 13:11.878
[chuckles]

13:12.966 --> 13:16.143
The concert will break up
the monotony of these papers.

13:16.186 --> 13:17.971
-Mm.
-Surprised you stopped writing
long enough

13:18.014 --> 13:19.320
to purchase the tickets.

13:19.363 --> 13:21.148
Look, it's not every day
that I have the chance

13:21.191 --> 13:23.019
to tell important people
how their decisions

13:23.063 --> 13:26.936
impact my ability
to keep operators safe.

13:26.980 --> 13:29.896
Can't be easy
sending people you're close with

13:29.939 --> 13:31.071
into the line of fire.

13:31.114 --> 13:32.202
It's not.

13:32.246 --> 13:34.814
I mean, they're family, so...

13:34.857 --> 13:37.860
Mm. So, say these
important people listen to you.

13:37.904 --> 13:40.907
Do you keep sending your family
into the line of fire,

13:40.950 --> 13:43.431
or do you step away?

13:43.474 --> 13:45.041
Find a new path?

13:46.869 --> 13:49.045
I kind of like
exploring new paths.

13:49.089 --> 13:51.526
-Little bit. Yeah.
-Mm. Mm-hmm?

13:53.876 --> 13:56.139
JASON:
That's great you've been able
to bring Leanne here. I mean,

13:56.183 --> 13:57.837
it's been really rough on Sonny

13:57.880 --> 13:59.839
-not being able to see her.
-HANNAH: No, well,

13:59.882 --> 14:02.015
the situation's not ideal
for either of us,

14:02.058 --> 14:04.495
but I could've done worse
in the co-parent lottery.

14:04.539 --> 14:07.411
Well, you know,
being his team leader,

14:07.455 --> 14:09.849
I can tell you too much praise
is not good

14:09.892 --> 14:11.154
-for his motivation.
-[all laugh]

14:11.198 --> 14:12.547
Whiskey works better.

14:12.590 --> 14:14.244
Yeah, or, uh, wrestling videos.

14:14.288 --> 14:15.593
Or shitty country music.

14:15.637 --> 14:17.030
-[chuckles]
-Wait, you don't have the cred

14:17.073 --> 14:18.509
to drag country music
through the mud like that,

14:18.553 --> 14:20.903
you know, with all
the French space pop music

14:20.947 --> 14:22.383
-you've been pushing
on me for years.
-MANDY: What?

14:22.426 --> 14:24.907
-That is a great album.
-No, it's not.

14:24.951 --> 14:25.952
So, what's y'all's story?

14:25.995 --> 14:27.867
Just friends.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.172
Yeah.

14:29.216 --> 14:31.392
Mm-hmm.

14:31.435 --> 14:34.438
-Oh. Oh, look at this.
-Let me see that.
Look at that thing.

14:34.482 --> 14:36.005
Hey, Leanne, you want to...

14:36.049 --> 14:37.920
you want to go
in Goldilocks' arms?

14:37.964 --> 14:40.183
-Come here.
-There you go.

14:40.227 --> 14:41.968
-Leanne. Hey.
-STELLA: Here we go.

14:42.011 --> 14:43.360
SONNY:
That's what it feels like
to be held by a princess.

14:43.404 --> 14:44.971
[all laugh]

14:45.014 --> 14:47.887
Whenever you need to blackmail
your dad, you let me know.

14:47.930 --> 14:49.453
All right? I know some things.

14:49.497 --> 14:50.933
-[Stella laughs]
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.195
-Yeah. [laughs]
-Yeah. [laughs]

14:52.239 --> 14:55.024
-You are behind. Noticed you...
-Oh, um...

14:55.068 --> 14:56.243
-Um...
-No, no, no, no. No.

14:56.286 --> 14:59.115
-Stella is not drinking.
-Yeah, I'm good.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.204
-SONNY: No drinking. She's good.
-STELLA: Yeah.

15:01.248 --> 15:03.032
-Yep.
-Whoa.

15:03.076 --> 15:04.251
You two are expecting?

15:04.294 --> 15:05.905
Um...

15:05.948 --> 15:07.341
[laughter, murmuring]

15:08.646 --> 15:10.997
Look, today is about Sonny
and Hannah's baby.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.433
Not, not ours.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.391
Come on, wait, come on,
this deserves a toast.

15:14.435 --> 15:15.915
All right? Come on.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.220
First of all, I want to welcome

15:17.264 --> 15:18.961
Hannah and baby Leanne here

15:19.005 --> 15:21.572
to the, uh, Bravo house, right?

15:21.616 --> 15:23.661
And, uh, here's to Clay and
Stella.

15:23.705 --> 15:25.489
And to a great future.

15:25.533 --> 15:28.405
-SONNY [laughing]: Yeah.
-Any addition
to the Bravo family

15:28.449 --> 15:31.017
is just a reminder that we have
to fight just as hard

15:31.060 --> 15:33.628
inside the wire
as we do outside the wire, so...

15:33.671 --> 15:36.065
-cheers.
-ALL: Cheers!

15:36.109 --> 15:37.980
All right, well, that's
two Bravo babies in one year.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.460
Must be something
in the DEVGRU water.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.027
Then you better not be
drinking it,

15:41.070 --> 15:42.419
'cause I'm closed for business.

15:42.463 --> 15:44.987
[laughter, clamoring]

15:45.031 --> 15:47.947
-JASON: Why?
-NAIMA: No more.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.122
[laughing]

15:49.165 --> 15:52.342
Oh, my God.
These two are perfect.

15:52.386 --> 15:54.997
[phones buzzing]

15:55.041 --> 15:56.042
-No...
-Uh-oh.

15:59.306 --> 16:01.090
[phones ding, chime]

16:03.658 --> 16:05.312
Seeing is believing.

16:05.355 --> 16:07.183
Seeing Sonny as a dad,
it's not so odd

16:07.227 --> 16:08.968
after seeing it.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.404
No, I meant you.

16:10.447 --> 16:12.449
-Oh.
-You found a way to be

16:12.493 --> 16:15.061
both Jason Hayes and Bravo 1.

16:15.104 --> 16:17.106
Now you're making sure
your guys are doing it, too.

16:17.150 --> 16:20.066
It's... a far cry from J-bad.

16:20.109 --> 16:21.458
All right, for both of us?

16:23.112 --> 16:25.288
Definitely.

16:29.597 --> 16:31.991
I'm sorry Rehoboth
got cut short.

16:32.034 --> 16:34.558
I guess I'll see you
when I see you?

16:34.602 --> 16:35.995
Yeah.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.300
I'll see you when I see you.

16:51.575 --> 16:53.490
Bryce Nichols.

16:53.534 --> 16:55.231
Agency case officer
who stayed in country

16:55.275 --> 16:57.712
after the U.S. withdrew
from Afghanistan.

16:57.755 --> 17:00.541
"Withdrew" must be cake-eater
for abandoned.

17:00.584 --> 17:03.109
A month ago, his cover was blown

17:03.152 --> 17:04.458
and he disappeared.

17:04.501 --> 17:06.503
He was presumed dead,
but the Agency

17:06.547 --> 17:08.505
picked up intel that
the Taliban are holding him.

17:08.549 --> 17:11.421
Current intel shows
they have Nichols at FOB Fenty.

17:11.465 --> 17:12.727
Sun's barely set
on our last stay there,

17:12.770 --> 17:15.034
and Taliban's already
taken it over.

17:15.077 --> 17:17.297
Probably not turning it
into a gender studies center.

17:17.340 --> 17:20.082
It appears they're using
the base as a supply depot.

17:20.126 --> 17:22.171
CLAY:
Yeah, supplies
that we left behind.

17:22.215 --> 17:24.086
We should learn
to clean up after ourselves.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.522
FOB's pretty secure, so, look,

17:25.566 --> 17:27.350
how many enemy we got on target?

17:27.394 --> 17:29.265
Taliban are only running
a skeleton crew to secure it.

17:29.309 --> 17:31.311
All the equipment and weaponry
we left means we're facing

17:31.354 --> 17:33.182
a force armed
as well or better than we are.

17:33.226 --> 17:35.358
Huge tactical advantage gone.

17:35.402 --> 17:37.273
No, we are the tactical
advantage, all right?

17:37.317 --> 17:39.319
Our best way in is a jump.

17:39.362 --> 17:42.061
So do we have, uh, eyes
in the sky watching over us?

17:42.104 --> 17:44.193
We're gonna send
a backpack platform with you.

17:44.237 --> 17:46.369
-Agency have a plan
to get us out?
-Ground Branch has arranged

17:46.413 --> 17:48.110
a driver and indig vehicle
to get you and Nichols

17:48.154 --> 17:49.372
across the border to Kashmir.

17:49.416 --> 17:51.505
Wheels up in an hour.

17:51.548 --> 17:52.810
Who says
you can't go home again?

17:59.513 --> 18:01.341
[indistinct radio transmission]

18:01.384 --> 18:03.256
We got to be the first frogmen

18:03.299 --> 18:05.606
to jump into Afghanistan
in 20 years, right?

18:05.649 --> 18:08.087
It was probably since,
uh, Team Three?

18:08.130 --> 18:10.306
Progress, War on Terror-style.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.743
Yeah, yeah.

18:12.787 --> 18:15.485
Trillions of dollars that
we dumped into that war there,

18:15.529 --> 18:18.749
and now we're using
paper airplanes

18:18.793 --> 18:20.403
-for overwatch.
-Hey,

18:20.447 --> 18:22.231
hey, this, uh,
paper plane's a missile.

18:22.275 --> 18:24.842
Show some respect, all right?

18:25.887 --> 18:27.845
Hey, boss dog.

18:27.889 --> 18:30.457
Spent most of the flight
in seclusion.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.589
[exhales]
You worried about the op?

18:32.633 --> 18:34.113
Ah...

18:34.156 --> 18:35.592
plan's solid.

18:35.636 --> 18:37.464
I agree.

18:37.507 --> 18:40.162
Feelings about where
we're heading aren't though.

18:40.206 --> 18:42.425
I mean, we spent more time
in Afghanistan

18:42.469 --> 18:44.645
than home some years.

18:44.688 --> 18:47.256
It ain't easy watching, uh,
all our work

18:47.300 --> 18:49.693
get undone on cable news.

18:49.737 --> 18:51.826
Look, our job
is executing the mission,

18:51.869 --> 18:54.829
all right,
not to express our feelings.

18:56.657 --> 18:58.398
So you were in rare form
at the party.

18:58.441 --> 19:00.661
-That right?
-Yeah.

19:00.704 --> 19:02.663
Yeah, curious timing with, uh,

19:02.706 --> 19:05.318
Mandy being around, I mean...

19:05.361 --> 19:07.537
Hope you guys got
to spend some time together.

19:07.581 --> 19:09.365
Ooh, what's that
supposed to mean?

19:09.409 --> 19:12.542
It means, it's just that...

19:12.586 --> 19:14.544
the way you were acting
when we were looking for her--

19:14.588 --> 19:16.720
something was driving you.

19:16.764 --> 19:18.418
Maybe that same something
that had you giddy

19:18.461 --> 19:20.550
-as a pig in shit
at my house, huh?
-Okay, you know what?

19:20.594 --> 19:23.205
She's my friend, okay?

19:23.249 --> 19:25.555
I went after her the same way

19:25.599 --> 19:27.775
I went after you
when I was looking for you.

19:27.818 --> 19:29.777
-Got it?
-Uh-huh.

19:29.820 --> 19:31.822
-Okay, friends.
-Yeah.

19:31.866 --> 19:33.911
-You know, you just keep
telling yourself that.
-Mm-hmm.

19:33.955 --> 19:36.392
But from where I sit,

19:36.436 --> 19:38.742
you two make
a lot of sense together.

19:38.786 --> 19:41.267
Damn shame if you can't
see that for yourself.

19:41.310 --> 19:43.704
Hey, fellas, time to get ready.

19:43.747 --> 19:46.446
RAY:
Captain.

19:46.489 --> 19:48.491
[grunts]

19:50.232 --> 19:52.408
[indistinct chatter]

19:52.452 --> 19:54.758
Still looks like home
from up here.

19:54.802 --> 19:56.717
Almost.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.546
Taliban's added
some personal touches.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.205
Havoc, this is 1. I pass James.

20:06.248 --> 20:08.337
Havoc copies James.

20:08.381 --> 20:09.773
Be advised,
video feed shows

20:09.817 --> 20:11.775
what appears to be
a series of cages

20:11.819 --> 20:12.994
at the outdoor gym.

20:13.037 --> 20:14.343
A group of unknowns
have gathered there.

20:14.387 --> 20:15.475
How copy?

20:15.518 --> 20:17.520
It's good copy.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.705
Must've missed a DRMO auction.

20:28.749 --> 20:30.664
We just leave everything?

20:30.707 --> 20:32.535
Haven't fixed a bridge at home
in 50 years,

20:32.579 --> 20:35.277
but least our tax dollars
armed up these Cheeto dicks.

20:35.321 --> 20:37.279
[indistinct chatter, clamoring]

20:51.989 --> 20:53.252
That's Nichols.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.735
Low port, trigger discipline.

20:58.779 --> 21:00.737
Textbook.

21:00.781 --> 21:02.652
Learned from the best.

21:02.696 --> 21:04.698
I guess we did have
an impact here.

21:04.741 --> 21:07.353
Let's focus up.
Eyes on the prize.

21:07.396 --> 21:10.312
[indistinct chatter]

21:10.356 --> 21:11.922
Sonny, Trent, move quietly.

21:11.966 --> 21:13.968
No shots fired.

21:15.448 --> 21:17.450
Cover down on them.

21:41.343 --> 21:42.997
Good?

22:06.063 --> 22:07.891
Are you serious right now?

35:35.698 --> 35:39.528
I'm suggesting that
you and Leanne move here.

35:39.572 --> 35:41.182
Live together as a family.

35:41.226 --> 35:44.751
But I-I own a business in Texas.
And you and I...

35:44.794 --> 35:48.189
Okay, I know there's other
details that we got to work out,

35:48.233 --> 35:50.670
but as far as you and I go...

35:50.713 --> 35:54.369
Look, Leanne
might've been an accident,

35:54.413 --> 35:57.242
but she ain't no mistake.

35:58.243 --> 35:59.505
And if you can tell me right now

35:59.548 --> 36:01.724
that you don't feel
anything real between us,

36:01.768 --> 36:04.336
then I-I'll... I'll drop it.

36:06.686 --> 36:08.862
But if there's...

36:08.905 --> 36:11.865
If there's any shot,

36:11.908 --> 36:16.478
then don't you think we...
owe it to our daughter

36:16.522 --> 36:19.220
to at least try
to make our family whole?

36:20.265 --> 36:22.832
Till you cut
and run on me again.

36:23.877 --> 36:26.662
[chuckles]
I learned my lesson.

36:26.706 --> 36:27.837
I have.

36:30.362 --> 36:32.364
Them running days are over.

36:38.544 --> 36:41.199
Let me just...

36:41.242 --> 36:43.549
try something.

36:52.558 --> 36:54.516
Thanks for coming.

36:54.560 --> 36:57.954
Yeah. I was, um,
surprised to get the invite.

36:57.998 --> 37:00.870
I'm sure Stella
put you up to this.

37:00.914 --> 37:02.611
[chuckles softly]

37:02.655 --> 37:05.223
Which answer's
gonna get you inside the door?

37:05.266 --> 37:06.746
[laughs]

37:06.789 --> 37:08.791
What the hell am I doing here?

37:11.403 --> 37:13.231
-[door closes]
-Cards on the table,

37:13.274 --> 37:14.884
I, uh...

37:14.928 --> 37:17.235
I looked up Ewing's sarcoma.

37:17.278 --> 37:18.627
Listen,
if you brought me in here

37:18.671 --> 37:20.238
to talk about odds,
I am gonna leave.

37:20.281 --> 37:22.240
I didn't.

37:22.283 --> 37:24.677
Yeah, I went by the hospital

37:24.720 --> 37:26.635
'cause I needed something
from you.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.943
What do you need?

37:29.986 --> 37:31.988
Doesn't matter.

37:33.381 --> 37:36.602
Look, I-I realized that instead
of focusing on what I need,

37:36.645 --> 37:38.604
I should consider what you need.

37:40.649 --> 37:43.391
I already told you,
I don't need anything, son.

37:43.435 --> 37:45.611
Then why'd you show up in town?

37:47.526 --> 37:49.615
Don't say Coop's boat, either.

37:56.012 --> 37:58.754
When you're staring down the
wrong end of a bad diagnosis,

37:58.798 --> 38:00.713
it gets you thinking
a little bit.

38:02.410 --> 38:04.934
And I know
I've messed things up,

38:04.978 --> 38:07.633
Clay, but whatever time
I have left...

38:10.636 --> 38:12.420
I'd like to try
to repair things,

38:12.464 --> 38:13.813
if you'll let me.

38:16.468 --> 38:17.904
You know, most of my life,

38:17.947 --> 38:19.993
you've been nothing more
than a chip on my shoulder.

38:25.825 --> 38:29.437
I don't know, I might not need
that chip anymore.

38:29.481 --> 38:31.483
Yeah.
[chuckles]

38:34.877 --> 38:38.968
And maybe remembering
what it's like to be a son

38:39.012 --> 38:41.580
will help me to be a better dad.

38:48.804 --> 38:50.763
[Stella clears throat]

38:50.806 --> 38:52.460
Hi.

38:52.504 --> 38:54.070
-Hey.
-Hey.

38:54.114 --> 38:56.943
Wow. [chuckles]
You, uh, you look beautiful.

38:56.986 --> 38:59.424
Oh, thank you.
How are you feeling?

38:59.467 --> 39:00.599
ASH:
Uh, I'm a little better.

39:00.642 --> 39:01.817
-Yeah?
-ASH: Yeah.

39:01.861 --> 39:04.864
-Good. You want to sit?
-Definitely.

39:06.387 --> 39:07.867
Oh, gosh.

39:07.910 --> 39:09.912
-[dishes clink]
-Mm.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.046
-CLAY: Here you go.
-STELLA: Oh.

39:13.089 --> 39:15.527
-[clears throat] None-none
for me, thank you. I...
-ASH: Wow.

39:15.570 --> 39:17.833
-All right.
-STELLA: Yeah.

39:17.877 --> 39:20.488
Peanut butter and banana
sandwich coming up, baby.

39:20.532 --> 39:21.663
-Yes, please.
-Wow.

39:21.707 --> 39:23.839
This smells used.

39:23.883 --> 39:26.015
-[Stella chuckles]
-What is it?

39:26.059 --> 39:28.496
-It's lentil stew.
-ASH: Oh.

39:28.540 --> 39:31.064
The...
The website says that it's

39:31.107 --> 39:34.502
full of potassium
and iron and fiber.

39:34.546 --> 39:36.678
It's all the things
you need right now.

39:36.722 --> 39:38.637
Um, I will trade this

39:38.680 --> 39:40.421
for a banana sandwich,
if you don't mind.

39:40.465 --> 39:42.858
-[Stella and Ash chuckle]
-I do mind. Look,

39:42.902 --> 39:44.425
Stella's growing a life
right now, okay?

39:44.469 --> 39:46.384
You're-you're growing...

39:46.427 --> 39:47.863
the opposite.

39:47.907 --> 39:50.692
[Stella and Ash laughing]

39:52.999 --> 39:54.957
Uh, do you need any help,
my love?

39:55.001 --> 39:56.089
Oh, God.

39:56.132 --> 39:58.700
No. No, no. I'm...

39:58.744 --> 40:00.528
I'm good.

40:00.572 --> 40:03.096
You guys just relax.

40:03.139 --> 40:05.533
I got this.

40:05.577 --> 40:06.969
[toy squeaking]

40:07.013 --> 40:08.536
[door unlocks]

40:11.104 --> 40:13.019
[whistles]

40:13.062 --> 40:16.718
-Hey.
-Oh! Wait a second.
This is a surprise.

40:16.762 --> 40:19.460
Made a stop on the way down.

40:19.504 --> 40:21.027
Wait a second.

40:22.768 --> 40:24.813
Dalessandro's?
What is the occasion?

40:24.857 --> 40:26.554
EMMA:
Came home to raid
the storage unit,

40:26.598 --> 40:29.078
grab some stuff
for me and Brad's new place.

40:29.122 --> 40:31.907
You know what? Bringing Italian
does not make up

40:31.951 --> 40:34.475
for the fact that, uh,
you're moving in with Brad

40:34.519 --> 40:36.042
when I told you
that you couldn't.

40:36.085 --> 40:38.653
We were looking for your
blessing, not your approval.

40:38.697 --> 40:42.091
Oh. Isn't that exciting.

40:42.135 --> 40:43.571
What are you doing?

40:43.615 --> 40:45.007
-[Emma exhales]
-Whoa, whoa, wait. Hello?

40:45.051 --> 40:48.010
-What are you doing?
-Uh, need keys for the truck.

40:48.054 --> 40:49.969
Okay. Well, they're...

40:50.012 --> 40:51.753
What's this?

40:51.797 --> 40:53.799
-[sighs, chuckles]
-The Sands at Rehoboth.

40:53.842 --> 40:56.062
-[chuckles]
-Sounds romantic.

40:56.105 --> 40:58.934
-Hope Eva had a nice time.
-[laughs]

40:58.978 --> 41:01.937
You're something else.
Eva? Who's Eva?

41:01.981 --> 41:04.113
Someone hasn't been taking
his memory pills.

41:04.157 --> 41:06.768
Eva's the woman Aunt Naima
tried to fix you up with?

41:06.812 --> 41:08.770
Oh, no. No, it's not...
it's not Eva.

41:08.814 --> 41:11.469
She failed on all levels. Sorry.

41:11.512 --> 41:13.209
-But you
definitely weren't alone.
-[bottles clink]

41:13.253 --> 41:15.516
-Do you remember
this woman's name?
-[refrigerator door closes]

41:15.560 --> 41:16.909
[sighs]

41:16.952 --> 41:19.172
Yeah, of course,
I remember her name. [chuckles]

41:19.215 --> 41:21.087
-Ooh, you like her.
-[laughs] Stop.

41:21.130 --> 41:22.523
Who is it?

41:22.567 --> 41:23.872
-Stop. She-she...
-Do I know her?

41:23.916 --> 41:26.135
Would you... Em, stop, okay?

41:26.179 --> 41:28.964
This is weird having this kind
of conversation with you.

41:29.008 --> 41:30.618
It can't be worse than talking
about my relationship.

41:30.662 --> 41:31.837
-[sighs]
-[chuckles]

41:32.838 --> 41:34.143
Mandy.

41:34.187 --> 41:35.841
-Mandy. Yeah, Mandy.
-Mandy?

41:35.884 --> 41:37.146
-Dad, that's incredible.
-Yeah.

41:37.190 --> 41:38.496
Wait, I thought she moved.

41:38.539 --> 41:39.714
How often do you see each other?

41:39.758 --> 41:41.499
-You guys
have always been so close.
-Stop.

41:41.542 --> 41:42.978
Just pump the brakes, okay?

41:43.022 --> 41:44.545
-We're just having fun here.
-Too much history

41:44.589 --> 41:46.068
between you two
for it to not mean anything.

41:46.112 --> 41:48.549
You were wrong. This is worse
than talking about Brad.

41:48.593 --> 41:49.811
-Don't do that.
-Really is. Don't do what?

41:49.855 --> 41:52.510
-Deny what you're feeling.
-[laughs]

41:52.553 --> 41:54.773
If you're excited about Mandy--
and clearly you are--

41:54.816 --> 41:56.078
then be excited.

41:56.122 --> 41:57.993
I know you have an arsenal

41:58.037 --> 41:59.995
of excuses
to put ahead of your happiness,

42:00.039 --> 42:02.694
but please don't be your own
worst enemy, for a change.

42:04.957 --> 42:07.916
[chuckles] You want to come
with me to storage?

42:07.960 --> 42:10.789
-What? No, I don't want to come
with you to the storage.
-[chuckles]

42:10.832 --> 42:12.268
Okay.

42:12.312 --> 42:14.793
Uh, I'm good.

42:14.836 --> 42:16.708
I have everything I need here.

42:18.884 --> 42:20.842
[door opens]

42:20.886 --> 42:22.888
[door closes]

42:34.290 --> 42:36.902
[sighs softly]

42:36.945 --> 42:39.774
Hey, Mandy.
