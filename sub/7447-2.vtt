00:01.080 --> 00:04.402
Judge says Kate Leigh must be
the worst woman in Sydney.

00:04.560 --> 00:06.403
No mention of Silly Divine.

00:06.560 --> 00:07.891
Police! This is a raid!

00:08.039 --> 00:09.451
Oi!
Step aside.

00:09.600 --> 00:11.125
What for?
Running a disorderly house.

00:11.280 --> 00:14.682
Mrs Leigh, I appreciate the information
you can pass my way,

00:14.840 --> 00:17.844
but I will not be used as a weapon
in your war against Tilly Devine.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.570
Alright, you got
two choices, mate.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.449
You get out of Melbourne
while the going's good

00:21.600 --> 00:22.806
or I'll end it right here.

00:22.960 --> 00:25.042
Always wanted to see Sydney.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.282
You're a virgin, that's good.
They're in short supply.

00:27.440 --> 00:30.842
How many times can I do it in a night?
We're gonna get on fine.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.570
It worries me when a girl like you

00:32.720 --> 00:36.441
finds herself consorting with
ne'er-do-wells in a place like that.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.807
I just wanna have some fun.

00:38.960 --> 00:40.405
She's got a gun!

00:40.560 --> 00:42.927
Where's your smart mouth now?

00:43.920 --> 00:46.207
I'm not here to kill you.
What do you want?

00:46.360 --> 00:49.409
I'm the man who's gonna take down
Kate Leigh and Tilly Devine,

00:49.560 --> 00:51.164
and you're gonna help me.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074

01:39.560 --> 01:42.166
Tilly and Kate! Jesus.

01:42.320 --> 01:45.130
They won't lie down easy.

01:45.280 --> 01:48.489
Squizzy forgot to tell me
you got no balls.

01:51.400 --> 01:54.006
What do you think
I'm talking to you for, Snow?

01:54.160 --> 01:56.527
You scare people.

01:56.680 --> 01:58.011
You've got a reputation.

01:58.160 --> 02:01.323
So with fear on your side,
numbers don't matter.

02:01.480 --> 02:03.244
Why not just kill 'em?

02:03.400 --> 02:05.243
You'd like that, would ya?

02:06.480 --> 02:08.163
You ready to swing for it?

02:11.560 --> 02:13.483
We've gotta be smarter than that.

02:13.640 --> 02:15.244
We'll need more blokes.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.802
Well, you know the locals.
Any ideas?

02:20.680 --> 02:23.047
Whoo! Nice job, Jack.

02:23.200 --> 02:26.249
Bet your missus can't wait to hug and
kiss you when you get home at night.

02:26.400 --> 02:27.731
What do you want?

02:27.880 --> 02:31.771
I hear you know a bit about
explosives. Electrics.

02:32.760 --> 02:34.091
Who are you?

02:34.240 --> 02:36.971
I served too. Pozieres, infantry.

02:37.120 --> 02:40.761
And you just got outta Long Bay.
That's the other thing I heard.

02:40.920 --> 02:43.491
Bit of safe-cracking gone wrong.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.325
Have you ever been shitcanned?

02:47.480 --> 02:49.528
I'm offering you a job.

02:57.920 --> 02:59.604
Fat pig.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.409
Fuck off. I'm having me tea.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.324
Keep eating, you'll explode.

03:05.440 --> 03:07.283
You're disgusting, Fatso.

03:07.440 --> 03:09.522
You make me wanna spew.

03:09.680 --> 03:12.160
My money's on the fat man.

03:12.320 --> 03:13.810
You.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.282
How come they call him
'The Midnight Raperâ?

03:27.560 --> 03:29.324
Let him go, George.

03:31.520 --> 03:34.091
Let him go or I'll blow
your fucking head off.

03:40.640 --> 03:42.290
Told you he can fight.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.682
Oh, leave it out!

03:50.680 --> 03:52.569
What'd you have to do that for?

03:52.720 --> 03:54.245
Just my way of saying hello.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.449
I'm number one, Snowy's two,

03:57.600 --> 04:01.082
Jack three, and Fat Man four.

04:03.880 --> 04:06.690
Norman Bruhn was a driven man.

04:06.840 --> 04:11.971
Testing the mettle of his men personally
was more about gauging his own resolve.

04:12.120 --> 04:16.921
Did he have the nerve and the guts
to take on Kate Leigh and Tilly Devine?

04:17.079 --> 04:19.890
Sydney's best apples,
right here on your doorstep!

04:20.040 --> 04:21.690
Best apples in Sydney!

04:21.839 --> 04:23.683
Hello, miss.

04:27.760 --> 04:30.286
Hope there are no grubs in it.

04:30.440 --> 04:32.647
Well, if there are,
I'll have to charge you extra.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.331
No grubs!

04:41.120 --> 04:42.724
How much do I owe you?

04:42.880 --> 04:44.644
It's on the house.

04:46.440 --> 04:51.287
Excuse me.
Can you tell me where Kate Leigh lives?

04:51.440 --> 04:53.329
First left, straight up. Number 42.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.289
What about Tilly Devine?

04:55.440 --> 04:56.771
Palmer Street.

04:56.920 --> 04:58.365
Number 25.

04:58.520 --> 05:00.648
Mind me asking why you're asking?

05:01.960 --> 05:03.450
Not at all.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.682
You're a bleeding shyster, Roy!

05:10.840 --> 05:13.161
Come again?
Typical Kate Leigh stunt.

05:13.320 --> 05:14.890
What?
Her idea, was it?

05:15.040 --> 05:16.804
Them lamb chops you sold me are rank.

05:16.960 --> 05:19.201
Tilly...
Have a whiff.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.850
Have a whiff

05:22.000 --> 05:24.207
I want my three bob back.

05:24.360 --> 05:25.691
There was nothing wrong
with them yesterday.

05:25.840 --> 05:28.525
Give me my three bob
or I'll report you to the Board of Health.

05:28.680 --> 05:30.205
Oh, you will, will you?
Yeah.

05:30.360 --> 05:32.488
Off you go, then. Toodle-oo.
You're not getting a refund!

05:32.640 --> 05:33.971
I want me fucking money!

05:34.120 --> 05:36.930
Tilly, you get out of my shop right now
or I will call the...

05:37.080 --> 05:41.449
Give me my fucking money or I will
put this knife in your fucking heart.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.004
Three bob, was it?

05:50.480 --> 05:52.084
Thank you.

05:53.120 --> 05:57.011
Oh, and if you see Kate Leigh,
give her this.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.209
Lost me appetite.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.005
Kate.

06:43.960 --> 06:46.691
Good morning, Mrs Leigh.
Hello, Father.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.171
How's tricks?

06:48.320 --> 06:50.527
Oh, I'm as fit as a fiddle,
since you asked.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.887
Pleased to hear it, Father.

06:57.080 --> 06:58.809
Katie.

07:05.320 --> 07:06.162
What you got?

07:06.320 --> 07:08.766
Sterling silver candlesticks, two pair.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.649
Ormolu clock, Swiss movement.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.564
Men's cufflinks, opal inlay,

07:12.720 --> 07:14.085
and a pearl-handled paper-knife.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.288
Five quid the lot.
Five?!

07:17.560 --> 07:19.722
I've got a family, Kate.
You're right.

07:19.880 --> 07:23.521
Four quid, final offer.
You know I hate whingers.

07:25.680 --> 07:27.648
It's called 'gingering'.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.531
Not strictly legal, but all the girls do it.

07:30.680 --> 07:32.170
Gingering?

07:32.320 --> 07:35.051
The way I see it, any bloke
walk in that door's fair game.

07:35.200 --> 07:37.646
I'll say!

07:37.800 --> 07:40.326
All our girls are lovely and clean.

07:40.480 --> 07:43.290
And they all know exactly
how to make a man happy.

07:45.240 --> 07:46.890
Take your time.

07:47.040 --> 07:49.202
Hard to choose just one.

07:49.360 --> 07:51.328
No law says it has to be just one.

07:57.880 --> 08:01.168
So, what do I do?
Attagirl.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.767
Oh, my God!
What?

08:05.920 --> 08:09.641
I've never been on top before!
You've got a lot to learn.

08:09.800 --> 08:12.246
Can't wait!

08:12.400 --> 08:14.687
First you need a mate with light fingers.

08:14.840 --> 08:18.447
Second, you got to have plenty of cheek.

08:18.600 --> 08:22.525
And the last thing you need
is a dirty big police whistle.

08:22.680 --> 08:25.081
Raid! Police raid!

08:25.240 --> 08:27.368
Come on, get up!
Get up! Go, go, go!

08:27.520 --> 08:30.046
Get out!
Come on!

08:30.200 --> 08:31.565
Come on!

08:31.720 --> 08:33.688
I seem to have lost my wallet.

08:33.840 --> 08:37.049
Come on!
Police raid!

08:38.360 --> 08:41.523
Reckon I'm a mug, do ya?

08:42.919 --> 08:45.605
An easy mark for a bit of gingering?

08:46.800 --> 08:48.211
Wasn't my idea.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.931
Well, you know what you're gonna do?

08:51.080 --> 08:53.560
You're gonna go out there
and get my wallet back.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.570
But not yet.

08:59.280 --> 09:01.521
Lie across my knee.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.610
Do I have to?

09:39.920 --> 09:42.082
Good?
Yes!

09:42.240 --> 09:43.810
Chop suey.

09:43.960 --> 09:44.802
Dig in.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.486
What's in it? Not chops.

09:54.440 --> 09:55.965
You're a gangster, aren't you?

09:57.360 --> 09:58.725
Say you are.

09:58.880 --> 10:00.644
Why?

10:00.800 --> 10:02.768
Gives you a thrill, does it?

10:03.800 --> 10:07.122
Eat up. I better get home,
read the kids a bedtime story.

10:07.280 --> 10:10.090
A married gangster.

10:10.240 --> 10:12.163
Businessman.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.687
Think of me as a businessman.

10:14.840 --> 10:18.162
I've never met anyone like you.

10:18.320 --> 10:20.641
Same here

10:22.360 --> 10:24.966
Why is a girl like you
earning a living on her back?

10:25.120 --> 10:27.361
You oughta be at school.

10:27.520 --> 10:28.851
Does it matter?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.604
I'm here now.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.444
And you're here now.

10:32.600 --> 10:34.887
That's what matters.

10:37.960 --> 10:39.291
Will I see you again?

10:39.440 --> 10:41.681
I promise I won't pinch
your wallet next time.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.241
You like a bit of excitement, yeah?

10:46.520 --> 10:48.045
Yeah, good girl.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.168
We're gonna have some fun.

10:55.640 --> 10:57.130
Hey, mate!

10:58.160 --> 11:00.845
A little birdie tells me
you're looking for good men.

11:02.840 --> 11:04.330
Here I am!

11:04.480 --> 11:07.086
Why would he need
a barrow boy?

11:07.240 --> 11:08.890
Come on, Norman.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.804
You see the sign?

11:13.240 --> 11:14.765
Keep your eye on the letter 'O'.

11:22.200 --> 11:23.690
What do you say?

11:25.800 --> 11:28.690
Go join a circus.

11:34.920 --> 11:37.048
So, Norm, when do we make a move?

11:37.200 --> 11:40.602
Hey! Not in front of the sheila!
She's one of us now, George.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.888
That makes you number five.

11:43.040 --> 11:45.646
Me number five'?!
When do we make a move?

11:45.800 --> 11:49.407
Or are you just another bullshitter,
like your mate, Squizzy Taylor?

11:49.560 --> 11:53.042
Well, you can walk away
any time you like, Snow.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.885
You go back to rolling drunks
and robbing the poor box.

11:58.360 --> 12:01.489
We strike the first blow tonight
against Kate

12:01.640 --> 12:04.928
and then we retaliate
on her behalf against Tilly.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.802
Here's mud in your eye!

12:33.800 --> 12:36.451
Drink up!
J' You who make my friends my foes... J'

12:36.600 --> 12:39.524
Evening, minister.
Lovely to see you, as ever.

12:42.320 --> 12:45.130
Who turned the lights off?

12:53.120 --> 12:54.724
No hawkers today, thank you.

12:57.440 --> 13:01.843
You leave my places alone or so help
me, I'll come after you with a pitchfork.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.684
Guttersnipe

13:03.840 --> 13:05.171
Bloody old moll!

13:05.320 --> 13:07.607
I never sold my body.
Yeah, 'cause nobody'd want it!

13:07.760 --> 13:09.569
Pommy slut!
Go back to where you came from!

13:11.960 --> 13:14.201
What you done now?
Nothing!

13:19.240 --> 13:21.447
Time to launch phase two.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.001
Anybody seen Fatso?

13:26.320 --> 13:28.891
Here he comes now.
What's he carrying?

13:29.040 --> 13:31.884
Jesus, what's that stink?
Got 'em, Norm.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.448
Plenty more where they came from.
You're a good man.

13:36.800 --> 13:39.041
What about
Frank 'The Gunman' Green?

13:39.200 --> 13:41.771
You can't call yourself 'The Gunman'.
There's too many of them already.

13:41.920 --> 13:45.129
Greg Gaffney works for Kate Leigh,
for example. That's his moniker.

13:45.280 --> 13:48.170
Could go round there and shoot
the bastard. That'd solve the problem.

13:48.320 --> 13:50.322
No, you've gotta use something else.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.369
'Junior Gunman', say.

13:52.520 --> 13:54.010
Piss off.

13:55.240 --> 13:56.810
Ah, sir, welcome.

13:56.960 --> 14:00.169
Step inside for some Devine pleasure.

14:08.120 --> 14:11.249
Nellie's booking's here
and she's a no-show.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.767
Jesus, those things stink.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.922
Kippers made the British Empire
what it is today.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.161
On the nose.

14:17.320 --> 14:18.810
Who's gonna do him?

14:21.600 --> 14:23.648
I don't take clients no more.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.689
We agreed.

14:25.840 --> 14:26.807
You agreed.

14:26.960 --> 14:29.440
You know he's not gonna touch
the others. So, what do I do?

14:29.600 --> 14:30.931
Send him home?

14:36.360 --> 14:37.850
Fuck him.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.204
Shut it.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.201
I know you wanted to see our Nellie,

14:56.360 --> 14:59.045
but I'm afraid she's visiting
her dying daddy.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.282
So you'll just have to put up with me!

15:01.440 --> 15:04.410
Alright, come on.
Let's get comfortable.

15:04.560 --> 15:07.404
Why don't we take off
these stuffy old clothes?

15:08.400 --> 15:10.767
What is that appalling stench?

15:18.280 --> 15:19.805
Jim!

15:19.960 --> 15:21.962
Jim!

15:35.960 --> 15:39.169
What the fuck happened?
What the hell's going on?

15:39.320 --> 15:41.448
There's rats everywhere!
Get out of the way.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.331
Get out here, Kate Leigh!

15:44.480 --> 15:46.403
You hear me? Get out here!

15:46.560 --> 15:48.767
The whole neighbourhood can hear you,
you dirty little fishwife!

15:48.920 --> 15:50.251
You've gone too far this time.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.164
I'm gonna give you
your own rotten fucking medicine.

15:52.320 --> 15:53.651
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.564
Oh, yeah, look forward to that.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.005
Holy Mary! Wally!

15:58.160 --> 15:59.969
Barney! Octopus!

16:03.640 --> 16:06.007
Don't you start something
you can't finish, bitch!

16:08.400 --> 16:11.244
Yeah, go back inside,
you fucking fishwife!

16:11.400 --> 16:12.890
Fuck!

16:15.320 --> 16:17.084
Why don't you just shoot them?

16:17.240 --> 16:19.686
Kate and Tilly?
Mmm.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.929
Do you wanna watch me swing?

16:25.200 --> 16:27.089
Well, that's what they do to murderers.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.686
Hang 'em by the neck till they're dead.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.410
Have you?

16:34.920 --> 16:36.570
Killed many people?

16:40.800 --> 16:42.290
With a gun?

16:44.800 --> 16:46.325
With a knife?

16:49.440 --> 16:51.010
With what, then?

17:32.680 --> 17:34.170
Feel good?

17:37.120 --> 17:40.522
You're a very... bad man!

17:48.960 --> 17:50.564
I don't need to kill 'em.

17:51.960 --> 17:56.170
Add enough fuel to the fire,
they'll kill each other.

18:00.760 --> 18:03.240
Tilly kills Kate and swings for it.

18:06.360 --> 18:08.169
It's beautiful.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.930
Want me to come in?

18:24.640 --> 18:28.804
Just keep my chrome
nice and shiny, Ernest.

18:29.800 --> 18:33.122
If I'm not back in half an hour,
call in the cavalry.

18:42.520 --> 18:47.321
What exactly is Phil The Jew
doing darkening my doorway?

18:47.480 --> 18:50.802
One of your boys done over
one of my street girls last week.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.361
Knocked off five quid's worth of snow,
according to her.

18:53.520 --> 18:56.922
Well, the way I hear it, she shoved
10 bob's worth up his nose

18:57.080 --> 19:00.289
to stop him telling everyone
she was selling for herself.

19:03.480 --> 19:04.970
And not you.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.364
Not here about that.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.729
Everyone's talking about you and Tilly.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.281
Says there's going to be all-out war.

19:16.440 --> 19:18.408
Yeah, she's the one
making all the moves.

19:18.560 --> 19:20.005
What if she's not?

19:20.160 --> 19:23.403
What if it's some other rooster
making it look like it's Tilly?

19:24.400 --> 19:26.607
What do you know, Phil?

19:26.760 --> 19:29.366
Well, there's a new boy in town.
Melbourne lad.

19:29.520 --> 19:31.443
Friend of Squizzy Taylor's.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.967
Norman Bruhn

19:34.120 --> 19:37.966
Why are you telling me this? Huh?

19:38.120 --> 19:41.647
Tilly and me rip out each other's guts,
you can just walk in and take over.

19:41.800 --> 19:44.485
Well, I have thought about it.

19:44.640 --> 19:48.281
But then I'd be in this rooster's
sights, then, wouldn't I?

19:48.440 --> 19:50.647
And I'm not as brave as you girls.

19:52.840 --> 19:56.208
So you want us to destroy him
to protect you.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.843
Squizzy Taylor's a killer.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.731
You think this coot's the same breed?

20:04.880 --> 20:06.962
We can't afford to assume he ainât

20:07.120 --> 20:09.248
We gotta stick together
on this one, Kate.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.448
I do me own dirty work.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.682
I don't do yours.

20:15.760 --> 20:17.091
How'd you go, boss?

20:17.240 --> 20:20.369
No wonder her husband left,
poisonous bleeding cow.

20:20.520 --> 20:25.128
Ernest, we need to change our strategy.

20:25.280 --> 20:27.362
No, we don't want
your mother to hear.

20:27.520 --> 20:30.683
Norm? There's
a Mr Phil Jeffs downstairs.

20:34.520 --> 20:36.124
Back in a tick.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.921
Phil Jeffs, Norman.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.650
You don't know me.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.885
But what can I do for Phil The Jew?

20:57.040 --> 21:00.806
Well, it's more what I can do for you.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.486
I hear good things about you, Norman.

21:03.640 --> 21:05.563
I can see a place for you in my firm.

21:05.720 --> 21:07.563
Like what, carrying your bags?

21:07.720 --> 21:09.131
Kissing your arse?

21:09.280 --> 21:13.171
Look, I know you're a serious fella
from my contacts down south.

21:13.320 --> 21:15.766
I just thought maybe we could
do some good for each other.

21:21.960 --> 21:25.442
I don't think I need
a fancy man like you, Phil.

21:30.520 --> 21:33.285
Unless I need a new suit, that is.

21:33.440 --> 21:35.841
Well, that's all Jews
are good for, ain't it?

21:36.000 --> 21:37.843
Tailoring.

21:55.920 --> 21:59.049
I think we deserve
the best seat in the house.

22:02.080 --> 22:04.811
There's a nice spot at the bar
for you gents up there.

22:11.240 --> 22:12.844
So, what'll you have?

22:13.000 --> 22:14.923
Lemonade and rum.

22:15.080 --> 22:17.526
Why don't you skip the rum?

22:17.680 --> 22:19.170
Lemonade and lots of rum.

22:31.760 --> 22:32.727
How do?

22:32.880 --> 22:34.803
You look beautiful tonight.

22:34.960 --> 22:36.086
Thank you.

22:36.240 --> 22:37.924
You like to dance?

22:38.080 --> 22:39.684
I'll say I do, yes.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.371
Oh, you mean with you?

22:42.520 --> 22:44.648
I don't think so. Sorry.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.525
He's a lucky old coot.

22:47.680 --> 22:49.444
He don't deserve you.

22:50.600 --> 22:53.843
I guess I'll just have to
dance by myself.

23:53.160 --> 23:54.400
My hat.

24:04.440 --> 24:05.487
Come.

24:05.640 --> 24:07.768
And keep your mouth shut.

24:17.920 --> 24:19.410
You wanted to see me?

24:19.560 --> 24:21.528
You got sixty seconds.

24:21.680 --> 24:23.603
I'm Norman Bruhn.

24:23.760 --> 24:25.171
Oh.

24:25.320 --> 24:26.845
Well, I'm very happy for you.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.365
So what?

24:28.520 --> 24:32.491
I'm not one of your Sydney pussies.
You oughta know that.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.687
Am I supposed to shit myself with fear?

24:36.720 --> 24:38.688
You had a good run, Kate.

24:38.840 --> 24:41.810
Now it's time to move on
before you get hurt.

24:41.960 --> 24:44.531
You only get one warning.

24:48.440 --> 24:50.522
I don't care who you are.

24:50.680 --> 24:54.685
Nobody pushes me around.

24:54.840 --> 24:57.764
I haven't even started to push yet.

24:59.560 --> 25:02.040
We got rid of your mate Squizzy Taylor,

25:02.200 --> 25:03.964
and we can get rid of you.

25:05.200 --> 25:08.682
Now fuck off and stop bothering me.

25:40.360 --> 25:43.409
So she's a tough old bat.

25:43.560 --> 25:45.164
No surprises there.

25:45.320 --> 25:47.288
So's Tilly.

25:49.360 --> 25:52.330
But they're no match for Norman Bruhn.

25:53.320 --> 25:55.243
Worst man in Sydney.

26:01.440 --> 26:04.842
I bet you could blow them away
with a single puff.

26:11.800 --> 26:13.723
I need an edge.

26:15.440 --> 26:18.125
You need a wash.
You smell like a dog.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.924
Something to put the wind up them.

26:21.080 --> 26:24.209
Make 'em tremble in their boots
when they hear me name.

26:33.360 --> 26:35.567
I can't afford to fail, Nell.

26:38.520 --> 26:41.171
Got too much at stake.
Too many mouths to feed.

26:50.520 --> 26:53.330
Go home to wifey.
Cry on her shoulder for a change.

26:57.800 --> 27:01.566
No, I wouldn't fly from New York
to Paris for all the tea in China.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.961
I mean, what happens
if you get engine trouble?

27:04.120 --> 27:06.282
Where would you land?
In the blinkin" drink, that's where.

27:06.440 --> 27:08.204
Oh, excuse the cursing, Mr Bruhn,

27:08.360 --> 27:10.761
but flying's not a natural condition
for human beings.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.684
I mean, it's an insult to the Almighty.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.320
Beg your pardon, Lord,
but we ain't happy with our legs.

27:15.480 --> 27:16.970
Now we want wings...

27:18.240 --> 27:19.571
Careful!

27:19.720 --> 27:21.609
Oh, sorry, Mr Bruhn!

27:21.760 --> 27:24.286
Oh, bloody heck!
I'd sooner cut me own heart out.

27:37.320 --> 27:41.723
Any time you're stopped by the jacks
carrying a gun, you get jail time.

27:41.880 --> 27:43.291
That's the law, right?
Yep.

27:43.440 --> 27:45.522
So we leave 'em at home.

27:45.680 --> 27:49.162
Unless we know for sure
we're heading into a firefight.

27:49.320 --> 27:50.731
We go unarmed?

27:50.880 --> 27:52.609
You gone fuckin" soft in the head?

27:52.760 --> 27:54.410
We carry these.

27:55.600 --> 27:57.204
The jacks search you,

27:57.360 --> 28:00.125
you're on your way home for a shave.

28:00.280 --> 28:01.611
A knife's better.

28:01.760 --> 28:03.125
You can kill with a knife.

28:03.280 --> 28:05.248
We don't need to kill.

28:05.400 --> 28:08.563
With these things, one stroke,
light as a feather,

28:08.720 --> 28:10.688
you can open a man's face to the bone.

28:11.880 --> 28:13.370
You ever had a razor cut?

28:13.520 --> 28:16.842
The bleeding never stops.
Buckets of blood.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.651
Take off an ear,
or maybe a nose.

28:19.800 --> 28:23.725
You fuck with Norman and his boys,
you'll end up wishing you were dead.

28:53.360 --> 28:56.125
Hello, my darling.
What's your name, then?

28:56.280 --> 28:58.726
Whatever you want it to be, sugar.

28:58.880 --> 29:03.568
Listen, three bob for a regular,
two bob just for a suck.

29:09.240 --> 29:12.483
No! No! No!

29:22.360 --> 29:24.328
It's like Whitechapel all over.

29:24.480 --> 29:26.323
Jack the Ripper.

29:26.480 --> 29:28.767
Except she's alive.

29:28.920 --> 29:31.082
Let's pray she stays that way.

29:33.280 --> 29:35.044
I wonder how she came to be there.

29:35.200 --> 29:36.531
It's her regular beat.

29:36.680 --> 29:39.809
No, I mean, why does a lass end up
on the street selling herself?

29:43.320 --> 29:45.482
Track down every villain we know
who uses a knife.

29:45.640 --> 29:47.210
Make them prove they're not our man.

29:49.400 --> 29:50.401
Tom?

29:51.600 --> 29:53.364
Don't be gentle.

29:58.640 --> 30:00.130
Get up.

30:03.040 --> 30:05.088
I told you it wasn't me.

30:05.240 --> 30:07.971
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

30:10.040 --> 30:12.725
You ever been whacked between
the shit and the wind, Guido?

30:12.880 --> 30:14.291
What?

30:16.520 --> 30:18.807
Did I say sit down? Eh?

30:18.960 --> 30:20.450
Get up.

30:22.200 --> 30:24.089
You're a knife man, Guido.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.685
Famous for it.

30:25.840 --> 30:28.730
I say that it was you
cutting that poor girl.

30:28.880 --> 30:30.211
No.

30:30.360 --> 30:32.203
I'm just a barrow boy.

30:32.360 --> 30:36.285
Yeah, with a big fuckin' knife!

30:49.120 --> 30:51.202
What's the world coming to?

30:53.120 --> 30:55.009
Wal, do we know this girl?

30:58.560 --> 30:59.925
Lorna?

31:00.080 --> 31:02.287
She used to move some snow
for us now and again.

31:02.440 --> 31:05.046
Lorna? With the pretty eyes?

31:09.040 --> 31:10.371
Here, give it to me.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.170
Come on.

31:51.120 --> 31:52.451
it's from Kate.

31:52.600 --> 31:55.171
Something to see you through.

31:56.160 --> 31:58.049
Thank you.

32:02.600 --> 32:03.931
Who was it?

32:04.080 --> 32:05.730
Which one of you?

32:05.880 --> 32:08.281
What makes you think
one of us done it?

32:08.440 --> 32:10.124
I hand out blades.

32:10.280 --> 32:13.363
An hour later, some poor tart
gets her face sliced off.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.889
It was you, Snow, wasn't it?

32:20.040 --> 32:21.804
Make you happy if I said yes?

32:21.960 --> 32:25.043
You're awful quiet,
Georgie Porgie.

32:29.400 --> 32:30.606
Oh...

32:34.080 --> 32:37.880
I... decide who and when.

32:38.040 --> 32:39.644
Not you.

32:41.360 --> 32:45.729
You step out of line again,
I'll slice your ears off.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.609
Righto

32:56.040 --> 32:59.089
Who's the toughest bloke in town?
Tom Kelly?

32:59.240 --> 33:01.481
Nah, nah, not Tom.
His brother, Sid.

33:01.640 --> 33:03.290
Bloody eats nails for breakfast.

33:03.440 --> 33:04.965
Snails?
Nails, fat head.

33:05.120 --> 33:07.009
Them Froggies eat snails, hey?

33:07.160 --> 33:11.370
Yeah, Sid. Definitely Sid.
Why?

33:11.520 --> 33:13.329
We slice him up,
him and his brother,

33:13.480 --> 33:16.051
Kate and Tilly'll pick up their skirts
and run for cover.

33:16.200 --> 33:17.884
Yeah? Why don't we just
bloody slice them up?

33:18.040 --> 33:19.530
Exactly.

33:20.560 --> 33:22.927
Because every copper
in Sydney'll come after us.

33:23.080 --> 33:24.969
Scared of the jacks are you, Norm?

33:25.120 --> 33:28.124
They got friends in high places,
you fool.

33:28.280 --> 33:31.887
Judges, politicians -
all regular customers.

33:32.040 --> 33:35.931
But they'll give us a medal for cutting
up a pair of mugs like the Kellys.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.731
And just how are we
gonna do that, Norm?

33:42.840 --> 33:45.810
I Na na way oh... I

34:15.400 --> 34:17.004
You want a piece?
You want a piece?

34:29.440 --> 34:31.204
Five quid on Kelly.

34:50.400 --> 34:53.324
I'll have some debt collecting work
for you at the end of the week.

34:54.679 --> 34:56.364
I'm gonna need the both of ya.

34:56.520 --> 34:58.329
Gentlemen.

35:02.440 --> 35:05.603
What do you wanna do tonight?
A feed, a drink and a root.

35:05.760 --> 35:09.048
Well, we're all cashed up,
so it's gotta be Tilly's on Palmer Street.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.328
They're the best tits in Sydney.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.249
Do me a favour, mate?

35:14.400 --> 35:16.562
Don't go hitting any of 'em this time.

35:20.080 --> 35:21.923
Will you be home in time
for the boys' bedtime?

35:22.080 --> 35:23.411
No.

35:23.560 --> 35:25.210
Do you have to work tonight?

35:25.360 --> 35:26.850
Yes.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.491
You'll be careful, won't you?

35:29.640 --> 35:31.130
Yeah, yeah.

35:32.840 --> 35:34.729
They wouldn't know
what to do without you.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.211
Where're you off to, gents?

35:45.360 --> 35:46.691
Palmer Street, Darlinghurst.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.729
Palmer Street. Right you are.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.645
Except I want to get dropped off
at Devonshire Street on the way.

35:51.800 --> 35:55.441
You wanna go to church?
St Peter's, mate.

35:55.600 --> 35:57.602
Drop Sid off then come back
and pick me up.

35:57.760 --> 35:59.728
Right you are.

36:13.680 --> 36:15.284
Something's up. I can smell it.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.771
By the pricking
of my thumbsac?

36:16.920 --> 36:18.251
What?

36:18.400 --> 36:21.404
By the pricking of my thumbs
Something wicked this way comes.

36:21.560 --> 36:24.040
Sorry?
The Scottish play.

36:24.200 --> 36:26.407
Intelligence report, sir?

36:26.560 --> 36:28.642
Nothing so specific.

36:30.440 --> 36:32.647
My maternal grandmother had the gift.

36:36.120 --> 36:37.485
Each man take a street.

36:37.640 --> 36:39.369
Walk in the light. Be visible.

36:39.520 --> 36:42.888
You're sending a message. Darlinghurst
is not a lawless town. Right?

36:43.040 --> 36:44.451
Off you go.

36:46.480 --> 36:48.881
Something wicked this way comes.

36:49.040 --> 36:53.762
Evil was already prowling
the laneways and backstreets.

36:53.920 --> 37:00.041
Darlinghurst was about to
become known as Razorhurst.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.808
Who do you like for premiers?

38:39.960 --> 38:41.291
Ulster.

38:41.440 --> 38:42.771
Ulster?

38:42.920 --> 38:44.922
Funny.

38:49.680 --> 38:51.603
Spare a bob?
Piss off!

39:03.120 --> 39:05.487
Hey! Me wallet!

39:21.240 --> 39:23.686
George Wallace!

39:27.240 --> 39:28.651
G- 'day, Sid.

39:30.040 --> 39:32.122
Where's the brother?
Wasn't with him.

39:32.280 --> 39:34.647
One Kelly'll have to do.

39:34.800 --> 39:37.007
You want a donnybrook?

39:37.160 --> 39:39.561
That's not exactly what we had in mind.

40:41.480 --> 40:42.606
Cut him.

41:28.120 --> 41:33.604
Cutting the throat of the toughest man
in Sydney was an act of pure terrorism.

41:33.760 --> 41:36.240
Norman Bruhn
had staked his claim.

41:39.400 --> 41:42.529
Kate Leigh and Tilly Devine's
comfortable world

41:42.680 --> 41:45.286
was about to be torn apart.

41:45.440 --> 41:49.843
Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.
