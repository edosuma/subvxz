WEBVTT

00:02.063 --> 00:04.998
The object is to destroy and demoralize.

00:04.999 --> 00:07.901
We will gouge out their
eyes, piss in their skulls,

00:07.902 --> 00:10.537
and anything left breathing, we rape!

00:10.538 --> 00:13.640
Damn, white people take
this softball shit serious.

00:13.641 --> 00:16.142
This is Brickleberry versus Yellowstone.

00:16.143 --> 00:18.144
I got 2 G's on this game!

00:18.145 --> 00:20.514
Now, in the spirit of
baseball, let's pray...

00:20.515 --> 00:22.458
That they all get Lou Gehrig's disease.

00:22.459 --> 00:24.951
- Amen.
- Shouldn't we wait for Ethel?

00:24.952 --> 00:26.688
I think she went to
look for her boyfriend.

00:26.689 --> 00:28.255
Who's the lucky fella this week?

00:28.256 --> 00:29.690
Slut.

00:29.691 --> 00:32.192
Sorry, I had something in my
throat before I said, "slut".

00:32.192 --> 00:35.128
Honey? The game's about to start.
What are you doing in there?

00:35.129 --> 00:37.097
Be out in a minute! I'm taping up.

00:37.098 --> 00:40.218
Oh, don't be so shy.

00:40.568 --> 00:41.735
Oh, my God!

00:41.736 --> 00:43.570
You are cheating on me with two women?

00:43.571 --> 00:45.171
It's not what it looks like.

00:45.172 --> 00:46.973
See? Only one woman.

00:46.974 --> 00:50.214
They're conjoined twins.

00:50.344 --> 00:51.879
Aw, come on!

00:51.880 --> 00:54.715
I don't even like the one
that controls the legs!

00:54.716 --> 00:57.785
So, uh, where were we?

00:57.786 --> 01:00.253
I was the one who
uncrossed our legs for you.

01:00.254 --> 01:02.414
Call me.

01:06.828 --> 01:09.228
<i>Brickleberry!</i>

01:14.903 --> 01:17.504
Damn it, you bastards! This
is the bottom of the ninth!

01:17.505 --> 01:18.939
It's our last chance.

01:18.940 --> 01:21.642
Come on, rally bear. Show some spirit.

01:21.643 --> 01:23.879
Why can't you dance
like those black bears?

01:23.880 --> 01:25.813
<i>Go yellow, go Yellowstone!</i>

01:25.814 --> 01:27.881
Go yellow, go Yellowstone!

01:27.882 --> 01:31.384
I am fighting the urge to
say something horribly racist.

01:31.385 --> 01:32.820
Oh, that reminds me.

01:32.821 --> 01:35.021
Denzel! Steal third base!

01:35.022 --> 01:37.524
Pretend it's a car stereo.

01:37.525 --> 01:39.593
I'ma kill that cracker one day.

01:39.594 --> 01:41.995
So, what are you doing after the game?

01:41.996 --> 01:43.664
I think you have the
wrong impression of me.

01:43.665 --> 01:45.566
I'm a lesbian, Sir.

01:45.567 --> 01:47.487
Ouch.

01:50.605 --> 01:51.872
All right, next up?

01:51.873 --> 01:54.775
Aw, Christ, it's Steve.

01:54.776 --> 01:57.656
Come on, easy out!

01:58.412 --> 02:00.481
Come on, Steve, don't choke!

02:00.482 --> 02:02.048
Let's hear it for Steve!

02:02.049 --> 02:03.416
Don't choke, Steve!

02:03.417 --> 02:06.553
Don't choke, Steve! Don't choke, Steve!

02:06.554 --> 02:08.455
Listen to that crowd, Steve.

02:08.455 --> 02:11.391
You're their hero. And you're 0 for 9.

02:11.392 --> 02:16.732
Statistically, you're almost
guaranteed to get a hit.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074

02:29.978 --> 02:31.344
- You're out.
- Out?

02:31.345 --> 02:32.679
How am I out?

02:32.680 --> 02:35.482
Because you slid into the
pitcher's mound, moron.

02:35.483 --> 02:36.817
Yellowstone wins.

02:36.818 --> 02:39.878
- Boo!
- Steve sucks!

02:40.287 --> 02:41.622
Ow! Ow! Ow!

02:41.623 --> 02:43.957
- Steve sucks!
- Loser!

02:43.958 --> 02:46.058
Burning!

02:46.360 --> 02:48.880
Burn! Burning!

02:49.397 --> 02:50.797
Thank God!

02:50.798 --> 02:51.999
Ow!

02:52.000 --> 02:55.617
So we lost the bet. This isn't so bad.

02:55.618 --> 02:59.006
One lap around the field naked
isn't the end of the world.

02:59.007 --> 03:01.107
Oh, what is that?

03:01.108 --> 03:03.544
Damn, I see your balls, but where is...

03:03.545 --> 03:05.946
It looks like you have
a vagina with balls.

03:05.947 --> 03:08.541
- You have a ball gina.
- Okay, okay.

03:08.542 --> 03:10.651
I don't know whether to
be grossed out or horny.

03:10.652 --> 03:12.640
I'm really confused right now.

03:12.641 --> 03:16.523
The point is we're still a team, right?

03:16.524 --> 03:18.625
Aw, okay. There it is.

03:18.626 --> 03:21.891
Damn, man. Looks like your
dick is stuck in quicksand.

03:21.892 --> 03:24.297
Come on. You guys can't be mad at me.

03:24.298 --> 03:27.024
Here you go, little fella. Grab
on to this and I'll pull you out.

03:27.025 --> 03:28.396
I'll get you to safety.

03:28.397 --> 03:31.217
I'm not mad at you, Steve.

03:31.218 --> 03:33.941
I just can't believe Carl cheated on me.

03:33.942 --> 03:37.210
I am so done with him. I do
have self-respect, you know.

03:37.211 --> 03:40.625
Oh, I know you do, sugar snatch.

03:40.626 --> 03:41.848
Oh, Carl.

03:41.849 --> 03:46.109
Now, you losers ready to do your lap?

03:51.425 --> 03:57.325
All right, good warm-up lap.
Now take 'em out on the pavement.

03:57.431 --> 03:59.466
Who agreed to that bet?

03:59.467 --> 04:00.834
Ah, Steve did.

04:00.835 --> 04:02.902
I didn't think we could lose.

04:02.903 --> 04:05.038
- We'll get 'em next week!
- Next week?

04:05.039 --> 04:07.407
I lost 2 grand on that game, Steve!

04:07.408 --> 04:09.576
I don't know how I'm
gonna pay up, Steve!

04:09.577 --> 04:11.678
Oh, you'll find a way to pay me.

04:11.679 --> 04:14.319
They always do.

04:15.282 --> 04:17.918
Guys, it's not my fault
I can't play baseball.

04:17.918 --> 04:19.452
No one ever taught me.

04:19.452 --> 04:23.074
You gotta remember, I
grew up without a father.

04:23.075 --> 04:24.504
- Aw, Christ.
- Blah, blah, blah.

04:24.505 --> 04:25.885
- Oh, brother!
- Gay.

04:25.886 --> 04:28.729
It's true. My father, Jonah Williams,

04:28.730 --> 04:33.834
was the greatest Park Ranger
Brickleberry had ever seen.

04:33.835 --> 04:38.119
He was a hero to both
man and beast alike.

04:38.120 --> 04:41.942
There was nothing he couldn't do...

04:41.943 --> 04:45.843
And he never failed to amaze us.

04:46.614 --> 04:49.438
But tragedy struck when he took
me on my first camping trip.

04:49.439 --> 04:51.217
It all started very innocently.

04:51.218 --> 04:54.855
"The doctor says Steve needs
anti-psychotic medication".

04:54.856 --> 04:56.690
"We are Christian scientists!

04:56.691 --> 04:58.391
I'll snap your neck, woman!"

04:58.392 --> 05:00.560
"Aah! You're hurting me!"

05:00.561 --> 05:01.795
"Aw, take that in the back!

05:01.796 --> 05:03.864
That (Bleep)ing goddamn
mother(Bleep)ing".

05:03.865 --> 05:05.845
"Aah!"

05:06.313 --> 05:09.870
But things took a dark turn,
and someone needed his help.

05:09.871 --> 05:12.091
My dolly!

05:21.282 --> 05:23.922
I'm okay, son.

05:29.073 --> 05:31.713
I'm okay, son!

05:32.160 --> 05:35.220
I'm still okay, son!

05:37.165 --> 05:40.405
That one hurt a little!

05:43.730 --> 05:46.840
The only comfort I get is
that he died peacefully.

05:46.841 --> 05:48.705
- Wow.
- Aw, please.

05:48.706 --> 05:51.842
Steve uses not having a dad
as an excuse for everything.

05:51.843 --> 05:55.148
Damn! Ow! Ouch! Ow! Oh! Oh!

05:55.149 --> 05:57.360
My father never taught me how to fight.

05:57.361 --> 05:58.551
Sorry, Denzel.

05:58.552 --> 06:00.353
My father never taught
me how to post bail.

06:00.354 --> 06:02.455
My father never taught
me how to ride a bike!

06:02.456 --> 06:03.724
Look out, look out, look out!

06:03.725 --> 06:04.991
Aah! Double-paned!

06:04.992 --> 06:07.493
Tempered! Stained glass!

06:07.494 --> 06:08.494
Storm window!

06:08.495 --> 06:10.714
Glass ceiling!

06:10.715 --> 06:12.406
That one stopped me.

06:12.407 --> 06:13.970
Enough excuses, Steve.

06:13.971 --> 06:16.521
Denzel never had a dad,
and he's not a wuss.

06:16.522 --> 06:18.057
Woody, my father raised me.

06:18.058 --> 06:20.692
By "father" you mean
"grandmother," right?

06:20.693 --> 06:23.250
Look, guys, I know I let you down.

06:23.251 --> 06:25.230
But those days are over.

06:25.231 --> 06:29.534
The next chance I get, I'm gonna prove
that I'm more of a man than anyone here.

06:29.535 --> 06:32.004
Including her.

06:32.005 --> 06:34.773
Uh, hi. Um, I've got
a real problem here.

06:34.774 --> 06:36.708
My campsite is littered
with half-eaten goats.

06:36.709 --> 06:39.469
Half-eaten goats?

06:40.947 --> 06:43.872
Crap. Looks like it's
that rabid cougar again.

06:43.873 --> 06:45.117
Which one of you is gonna hunt him down?

06:45.118 --> 06:46.374
You know what?

06:46.375 --> 06:48.420
I've been looking for an
opportunity to prove my manhood

06:48.421 --> 06:50.405
since about 30 seconds ago.

06:50.406 --> 06:52.636
I'll do it.

06:52.637 --> 06:55.461
Sorry, I guess you didn't know
that I wasn't finished speaking.

06:55.462 --> 06:57.296
I'd like my $10 camping fee back.

06:57.297 --> 07:01.907
No problem, I'll just
run your credit card.

07:01.908 --> 07:06.105
Done. Should show up on your
statement at the end of the month.

07:06.106 --> 07:09.174
You suck. You are a pile of shit.

07:09.175 --> 07:11.545
And I want you to know that
your parents just called,

07:11.546 --> 07:13.245
and they're getting a divorce.

07:13.246 --> 07:15.847
They said it's your fault,
because you have leukemia

07:15.848 --> 07:17.483
and all your hair's gonna fall out.

07:17.484 --> 07:19.684
Who are you talking to?

07:19.685 --> 07:22.396
Son, we have something to tell
you. We're getting divorced.

07:22.397 --> 07:25.517
And you have leukemia.

07:25.565 --> 07:29.567
Malloy, I know it's past the deadline,
but I've almost got your $2,000 together.

07:29.568 --> 07:31.303
I just need $1,900 more.

07:31.304 --> 07:34.006
You worry too much, Woody.
We'll work something out.

07:34.007 --> 07:36.687
Okay, so what are you thinking?
Some kind of installment plan?

07:36.688 --> 07:38.777
Will you relax?

07:38.778 --> 07:40.312
Here.

07:40.313 --> 07:43.193
Sniff this for me.

07:48.054 --> 07:52.690
Don't look at me like
that, it's just business.

07:52.691 --> 07:54.559
How am I ever gonna find this cougar?

07:54.560 --> 07:56.094
Follow the dead goats.

07:56.095 --> 07:57.796
Good idea, voice in my head.

07:57.797 --> 07:59.697
You sound so much cooler
than when I talk out loud.

07:59.698 --> 08:01.400
It's me, dumb ass.

08:01.401 --> 08:03.868
You picked the wrong time
to start acting like a man.

08:03.869 --> 08:05.570
That cougar's gonna
eat you alive, Steve.

08:05.571 --> 08:07.958
Thanks for the tough love. Namaste.

08:07.959 --> 08:09.227
"Namaste".

08:09.228 --> 08:14.868
Nah, I'ma stay right here
where there ain't no cougars.

08:16.849 --> 08:20.029
Your suffering is over.

08:21.421 --> 08:24.301
Mercy is upon you.

08:25.158 --> 08:27.359
Uh, sorry about that.

08:27.360 --> 08:30.762
Now, mercy will be upon you.

08:30.763 --> 08:32.164
Almost done.

08:32.164 --> 08:34.158
You'll be with Jesus soon.

08:34.159 --> 08:36.019
Die!

08:40.239 --> 08:44.559
Save a place for me in heaven, friend.

08:52.418 --> 08:56.018
That must be where it lives.

08:56.395 --> 08:59.155
Be a man, Steve.

09:00.031 --> 09:01.817
Be a man, be a man, be a man,

09:01.818 --> 09:06.438
be a man, be a man, be a man, be a man.

09:08.168 --> 09:11.708
I don't want to be a man!

09:17.411 --> 09:18.444
Dad?

09:18.445 --> 09:20.947
Oh, my God. Dad!

09:20.948 --> 09:23.228
It's you!

09:23.984 --> 09:26.371
I have one question for you, dad.

09:26.372 --> 09:29.912
Why do I have a ball gina?

09:31.961 --> 09:34.334
- That's your dad?
- Yeah.

09:34.335 --> 09:36.452
Dad, meet Denzel.

09:36.453 --> 09:37.433
Aah!

09:37.434 --> 09:40.479
No! Eh, eh, eh! Eh, eh, eh, dad!

09:40.480 --> 09:43.294
Jonah, listen, sorry
I never looked for you.

09:43.295 --> 09:46.531
I meant to, but your wife was
in dire need of comforting,

09:46.532 --> 09:48.800
way down deep in her uterus.

09:48.801 --> 09:50.735
I've held my tongue long enough.

09:50.736 --> 09:54.156
Your dad smells like shit.

09:54.406 --> 09:56.841
Don't tell me you're still
pissed about this kidney thing,

09:56.842 --> 09:58.106
because I've moved on.

09:58.107 --> 10:04.007
The important thing is my dad is
back and he hasn't changed a bit.

10:06.659 --> 10:09.606
- Well, that's kind of new.
- Yo, that's messed up.

10:09.607 --> 10:11.255
I'll tell you what's messed up...

10:11.256 --> 10:13.090
Your judgmental attitude.

10:13.091 --> 10:18.177
Father just needs a little
help readjusting to society.

10:18.178 --> 10:21.031
Dad's new comedy bit. He's almost done.

10:21.032 --> 10:23.811
Okay, that's enough.

10:23.812 --> 10:26.193
Okay, pops, we get it.

10:26.194 --> 10:27.338
Please don't finish.

10:27.339 --> 10:29.199
Aah!

10:33.124 --> 10:35.684
Why do I always fall for the wrong guy?

10:35.685 --> 10:38.949
I just want a nice guy, someone
who will treat me with respect.

10:38.950 --> 10:41.586
I bet that person's
closer than you think.

10:41.587 --> 10:46.090
Oh, Connie, I'm so lucky to
have a platonic friend like you.

10:46.091 --> 10:48.558
Stop being so chicken shit, Connie.

10:48.559 --> 10:49.894
Tell her how you feel.

10:49.895 --> 10:53.297
Tell her you want to start a fire
by rubbing your 'ginas together.

10:53.298 --> 10:54.799
Don't talk about her like that.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.114
Talk about who like that?

10:57.115 --> 10:59.515
Ellen's on.

11:00.773 --> 11:03.542
Now, father, since you've
returned to the civilized world,

11:03.543 --> 11:05.100
it's crucial that you
learn the difference

11:05.101 --> 11:09.280
between a salad fork and a dessert fork.

11:09.281 --> 11:12.417
No, no, no. Salad fork.

11:12.418 --> 11:14.278
Hmm?

11:17.456 --> 11:19.757
What is going on here?

11:19.758 --> 11:21.975
Armando, these are people
trying to have a nice meal.

11:21.976 --> 11:23.694
Why you bother them?

11:23.695 --> 11:25.878
Allow me to apologize
on Armando's behalf.

11:25.879 --> 11:28.872
He is new, but he is very good boy.

11:28.873 --> 11:33.805
Armando, uh, why don't you go and get
these nice people some free bread sticks?

11:33.806 --> 11:35.205
You come back anytime.

11:35.206 --> 11:41.086
Anybody you wanna stab him in
the neck, you go right ahead.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.806
Yippee!

12:13.044 --> 12:15.264
Aah! Aah!

12:20.264 --> 12:22.987
All aboard the Williams
and Son rail road!

12:22.988 --> 12:26.994
Now departing for happily ever after!

12:26.995 --> 12:28.770
You know what would
make this even better?

12:28.771 --> 12:31.111
Snow cones.

12:31.563 --> 12:34.298
Hey, Steve, I'm doing
my match dot com profile,

12:34.299 --> 12:37.301
and I need a polite way
to say "no Armenians".

12:37.302 --> 12:40.237
Now, do you think they'll take a
hint if I say I don't like uni-brows,

12:40.238 --> 12:44.851
or should I also throw
in "no white BMW's"?

12:44.852 --> 12:47.797
Oh, hello. You must be Steve's father.

12:47.798 --> 12:50.014
Excuse me. I just said hello.

12:50.015 --> 12:51.649
Is that any way to treat a woman?

12:51.650 --> 12:54.793
You're rude, you're
disrespectful, you're...

12:54.794 --> 12:57.087
Just my type.

12:57.088 --> 13:01.888
- Do you want tutti-frutti
or goo-goo gra...

13:09.501 --> 13:11.235
Are you just gonna sit
there and do nothing

13:11.236 --> 13:13.538
while that creep bangs your true love?

13:13.539 --> 13:16.186
Ethel's a grown woman. She
can date whoever she wants.

13:16.187 --> 13:17.298
You're pathetic.

13:17.299 --> 13:20.082
You don't even deserve
an evil alter ego.

13:20.083 --> 13:21.934
I'm not listening to you.

13:21.935 --> 13:25.683
Why are we yelling at deer piss?

13:25.684 --> 13:27.118
It's not fair.

13:27.119 --> 13:30.554
My father and I were just starting
to rebuild our relationship.

13:30.555 --> 13:34.492
I shouldn't have to share him with her.

13:34.493 --> 13:35.841
Darling, I'll handle this.

13:35.842 --> 13:39.578
Steve, you're going to have to accept
that what your father and I have is real.

13:39.579 --> 13:40.746
Real kinky.

13:40.747 --> 13:42.714
Anything you can
imagine, we've tried it.

13:42.715 --> 13:43.949
Think about that for a minute.

13:43.950 --> 13:46.323
See? She's driving me crazy.

13:46.324 --> 13:48.093
And how does that make you feel?

13:48.094 --> 13:50.389
Crazy. Wow, you're good.

13:50.390 --> 13:52.258
Doctor, I understand Steve's pain,

13:52.259 --> 13:54.560
but Jonah's unlike any
man I've dated before.

13:54.561 --> 13:56.495
Sure, he doesn't say much, but so what?

13:56.496 --> 13:59.498
My banter is charming
enough for two people.

13:59.499 --> 14:03.981
That's a good one, Ethel.
Oh, it certainly is.

14:03.982 --> 14:06.674
No, now is not the
right time, sweetheart.

14:06.675 --> 14:07.873
Fine, I'll tell him.

14:07.874 --> 14:11.077
Steve, your father and
I, we're getting married.

14:11.078 --> 14:12.178
What?

14:12.179 --> 14:13.712
I'm sorry you had to learn this way.

14:13.713 --> 14:15.581
I was hoping you'd find out on Facebook.

14:15.582 --> 14:16.915
I can't handle this.

14:16.916 --> 14:18.217
You need to choose, dad.

14:18.218 --> 14:20.978
It's her or me.

14:21.840 --> 14:25.620
I see you've made your choice.

14:27.356 --> 14:30.696
Good news, I'm getting 2 grand for your
kidney on the Jamaican black market.

14:30.697 --> 14:32.508
As far as I'm concerned, we're square.

14:32.509 --> 14:35.934
Come on, snuggly-wubs,
don't sell my kidney.

14:35.935 --> 14:38.375
Just give me a chance to win
it back, double or nothing.

14:38.376 --> 14:40.606
- I don't know.
- Please, give me a chance!

14:40.607 --> 14:43.406
- I'll bet on anything you want!
- I bet you will.

14:43.407 --> 14:45.271
- Okay, let's bet.
- We just did.

14:45.272 --> 14:47.880
- Did I win?
- Ooh, you lost.

14:47.881 --> 14:49.307
Goddamn it!

14:49.308 --> 14:52.728
Oh, man, he's on a roll.

14:53.325 --> 14:55.754
That was such a fun night.

14:55.755 --> 14:57.856
Sounds like we both have a problem.

14:57.857 --> 14:59.992
Who are you?

14:59.993 --> 15:01.373
Oh, Connie.

15:01.374 --> 15:02.925
Here's the thing, Steve.

15:02.926 --> 15:05.231
Neither of us want
this wedding to happen.

15:05.232 --> 15:07.475
Perhaps we should join forces.

15:07.476 --> 15:09.668
Yeah, join forces.

15:09.669 --> 15:11.314
Do as I say...

15:11.315 --> 15:15.035
And we'll both be very happy.

15:16.009 --> 15:19.678
Yeah, yeah. You're... you're...
you're not gonna hurt my dad, are you?

15:19.679 --> 15:21.813
Of course not. He'll be fine...

15:21.814 --> 15:23.449
In hell.

15:23.450 --> 15:24.517
How did you do that?

15:24.518 --> 15:28.210
Sorry. I farted on your candle.

15:28.211 --> 15:30.347
Are you with the bride or the groom?

15:30.348 --> 15:32.824
She's with the bride,
she's with the groom.

15:32.825 --> 15:35.127
Anybody got a chain saw?

15:35.128 --> 15:36.762
Sorry I dragged you to this.

15:36.763 --> 15:40.603
Actually, I dragged you to this.

15:43.286 --> 15:45.701
Well, I'm happy for you, dad.

15:45.702 --> 15:47.506
No ulterior motives here.

15:47.507 --> 15:48.865
Ha! Good one.

15:48.866 --> 15:50.876
Would you excuse me, father?
I need to sabotage the wedding.

15:50.877 --> 15:52.678
Not this wedding, a different one.

15:52.679 --> 15:54.692
The Finklesteins, Bob and
Jill. You don't know them.

15:54.693 --> 15:56.448
Nobody knows them. They're made up.

15:56.449 --> 15:58.551
Damn it!

15:58.552 --> 16:01.090
So, here it is, my life
savings, just like you wanted.

16:01.091 --> 16:02.302
$400.

16:02.303 --> 16:04.382
So, what are we spending it on?

16:04.383 --> 16:06.525
No, don't tell me. I
want to be surprised.

16:06.526 --> 16:08.386
Woo!

16:09.962 --> 16:10.962
- Woo!
- Ooh!

16:10.963 --> 16:12.097
Uh, I got it.

16:12.098 --> 16:16.418
We're gonna hit Ethel with this crate.

16:19.673 --> 16:24.409
Oh, Malloy, you make the
cutest ring-"bear"- er.

16:24.410 --> 16:25.404
Oh, you are funny.

16:25.405 --> 16:28.414
Is that why you're wearing white
on your wedding day, you whore?

16:28.415 --> 16:30.683
I cannot believe you
brought that thing here.

16:30.684 --> 16:32.418
Talk about passive-aggressive.

16:32.419 --> 16:34.220
Come on, let me get even.

16:34.221 --> 16:36.261
One more shot, double or nothing.

16:36.262 --> 16:38.913
You need help, Woody.
You've got a disease.

16:38.914 --> 16:41.193
I know that because when I
tried to sell your kidney,

16:41.194 --> 16:43.229
they said, "that man has a disease".

16:43.230 --> 16:44.896
Well, I need to get
this wedding started.

16:44.897 --> 16:47.299
I've only got five minutes
of clean blood left.

16:47.300 --> 16:50.982
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
today to legitimize the fornication

16:50.983 --> 16:53.008
between this beautiful
woman and this man, who...

16:53.009 --> 16:56.609
Oh, God, he's eating a rat.

16:57.043 --> 16:58.944
Huh? My God.

16:58.945 --> 17:00.412
Connie's totally lost it.

17:00.413 --> 17:01.947
She's planning on murder.

17:01.948 --> 17:03.482
I need to do something.

17:03.483 --> 17:07.867
Dad, why don't you and
Ethel switch places?

17:07.867 --> 17:10.448
Crisis averted.

17:10.790 --> 17:11.823
Damn, she's good.

17:11.824 --> 17:13.953
Would you, uh, excuse me, everyone?

17:13.954 --> 17:17.973
I, uh, have to make a number two.

17:20.569 --> 17:22.729
Come on.

17:22.989 --> 17:26.348
And now, to save my dad!

17:28.230 --> 17:31.166
Marriage is the sacred
union of man and woman,

17:31.167 --> 17:34.670
not man and man, and certainly
not between the races,

17:34.671 --> 17:36.433
except for Spaniards and Asians.

17:36.434 --> 17:40.714
They make Filipinos, who are great
looking and desperate for cash.

17:40.715 --> 17:42.878
What are you waiting
for? Pull the trigger.

17:42.879 --> 17:44.245
I don't know if I can do this.

17:44.246 --> 17:46.381
You're a weak, bloated land whale.

17:46.382 --> 17:49.484
Why did I even lug that
stupid boudoir up here?

17:49.485 --> 17:51.820
Freeze, you weak, bloated land whale.

17:51.821 --> 17:54.768
Why is everyone picking on me?

17:54.769 --> 17:57.229
Gimme! Gimme!

18:03.536 --> 18:05.996
- No!
- Aah!

18:06.172 --> 18:08.545
I'm such a dick.

18:08.546 --> 18:10.346
Ah!

18:14.804 --> 18:16.984
- Whoa!
- Gimme that! Gimme that!

18:16.985 --> 18:18.564
- Uh!
- Uh! Gimme!

18:18.565 --> 18:21.701
I don't usually hit women,
but I have no other choice.

18:21.702 --> 18:23.562
Aah!

18:23.704 --> 18:26.404
Hey, let me go!

18:26.439 --> 18:28.340
Aah! Aah!

18:28.341 --> 18:30.381
Kegels.

18:39.617 --> 18:41.308
This is terrible.

18:41.309 --> 18:43.741
I'll never look in a mirror again.

18:43.742 --> 18:45.928
It's gonna make it really
tricky when you shave.

18:45.929 --> 18:47.593
I just want Jonah to be okay.

18:47.594 --> 18:51.319
Well, I want him to be more than okay,
because I love him more than you do.

18:51.320 --> 18:53.165
Oh, Steve, we're not in competition.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.734
We love him in different ways.

18:54.735 --> 18:56.368
Your love is innocent and simple.

18:56.369 --> 18:59.972
Ours is nasty and dirty,
violent and sexual.

18:59.973 --> 19:02.203
Good news, everyone. The
patient's going to make it.

19:02.204 --> 19:03.702
Yay, he's alive.

19:03.703 --> 19:05.878
- Oh, thank God.
- Hell yeah.

19:05.879 --> 19:07.569
Oh, one minor detail.

19:07.570 --> 19:09.745
- He's not your father.
- What?

19:09.746 --> 19:11.530
How do you know that?

19:11.531 --> 19:13.233
I know that because he's a bear.

19:13.234 --> 19:14.987
- A bear?
- I (Bleep) A bear?

19:14.988 --> 19:16.822
Ooh, even I think that's bad.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.690
Yes, he had a bad case of the mange.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.993
Most of his fur fell out,
but now he's as good as new.

19:20.994 --> 19:23.129
Damn it, I bet he was a human.

19:23.130 --> 19:24.247
I thought that was a lock.

19:24.248 --> 19:27.266
You definitely have a gambling problem.

19:27.267 --> 19:32.013
When we're done with you, mon, you're
gonna be nothing but a mustache.

19:32.014 --> 19:36.634
Well, at least he
didn't get me pregnant.

19:46.706 --> 19:48.390
Good-bye, old bear.

19:48.391 --> 19:51.720
Just so you know, I'm not mad at you
for lying to me and breaking my heart.

19:51.721 --> 19:54.593
Steve, we both saw things in
this bear that we wanted to see,

19:54.594 --> 19:55.838
but we learned from this.

19:55.839 --> 19:58.831
Yeah, I learned I don't need
a father to make me a man.

19:58.832 --> 20:03.368
These past few days, I learned how to
ride a bike, and I almost beat up a woman.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.070
That's as manly as it gets.

20:05.071 --> 20:07.572
Mmm, and I learned to
be more open-minded.

20:07.573 --> 20:08.997
After being intimate with a bear,

20:08.998 --> 20:12.865
I'm almost ready to
consider dating an Armenian.

20:12.866 --> 20:15.686
Son, is that you?

20:16.656 --> 20:19.051
Oh, no, I'm not falling for that again.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.972
Gaah!

20:22.122 --> 20:24.342
My heart.

20:27.861 --> 20:29.661
Oh!
