00:01.600 --> 00:03.533
(Birds chirruping)

00:24.767 --> 00:26.700
(Detector beeps)

00:31.167 --> 00:32.600
Anything?

00:37.367 --> 00:38.433
Linda!

00:45.467 --> 00:46.567
What you got?

00:47.667 --> 00:50.133
Ring pull. 78.

00:52.633 --> 00:53.767
Kestrel Super.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.233
(Bird screeches overhead)

01:03.200 --> 01:04.733
Kestrel.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.467
Super.

01:08.500 --> 01:10.433
(Beeping)

01:12.400 --> 01:15.067
(Beeping continues)

01:17.467 --> 01:19.133
(Thuds controls)

01:19.167 --> 01:21.100
(Beeping continues)

01:23.533 --> 01:25.533
(Beeping continues)

01:31.567 --> 01:33.500
(Beeping stops)

02:06.167 --> 02:10.833
* Will you search through
the lonely earth for me?

02:10.866 --> 02:14.233
* Climb through the briar
and bramble?

02:15.567 --> 02:20.767
* I'll be your treasure

02:20.800 --> 02:25.300
* I'm waiting for you

02:25.333 --> 02:28.533
* I'm waiting for you

02:46.200 --> 02:47.433
LANCE: What?

02:48.700 --> 02:50.533
ANDY: Go! Go, go.

02:54.367 --> 02:56.133
- (Exhaust backfires)
- (Car alarm)

02:56.167 --> 02:58.967
ANDY: Go, go!

03:02.700 --> 03:04.700
I said I'd meet you
at the end of the road.

03:04.733 --> 03:05.900
Yeah, well, you weren't there.

03:05.933 --> 03:08.500
- Couldn't you have waited?
- Look, you know the deal:

03:08.533 --> 03:11.167
first to arrive
gets first choice of the field.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.067
Can't afford to let Terra Firma,

03:13.100 --> 03:15.433
or whatever else they're calling
themselves today,

03:15.467 --> 03:16.767
get there before us.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.400
Oh, yeah.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.433
I had a brilliant dream
last night.

03:24.467 --> 03:26.400
Yeah?

03:27.767 --> 03:29.400
Brilliant.

03:38.767 --> 03:41.333
You have got to be joking me.

03:41.367 --> 03:42.433
Bastards.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.667
You strapped in?

03:48.400 --> 03:50.167
(Clicks)

05:07.533 --> 05:09.100
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

05:10.133 --> 05:12.067
(Engine revs)

05:14.433 --> 05:17.133
Whoa-ho! Whoa-ho!

05:17.167 --> 05:18.800
Stick that up your Arado!

05:18.833 --> 05:21.400
(Both laugh)

05:21.433 --> 05:22.600
That was brilliant.

05:22.633 --> 05:27.233
That was like Hill Street Blues
or...or...CHiPS or summat.

05:27.267 --> 05:29.100
When we came
to that gradual bend...

05:29.133 --> 05:30.700
I was right on his tail.

05:30.733 --> 05:35.033
- You were glued to the road.
- Oh, that was just...terrific.

05:35.067 --> 05:38.100
Good times. Good times.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.133
So you don't think
you were even hypnotised?

05:46.167 --> 05:48.667
Oh, I know I wasn't.
Nowhere near.

05:48.700 --> 05:51.367
I pretended I was, but...wasn't.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.067
And when you got on the boat
you were just as sick?

05:54.100 --> 05:57.233
Sicker.
It was just foam by the end.

05:59.433 --> 06:04.367
Ah, here they are at last.
Wallace and Gromit.

06:04.400 --> 06:08.067
ANDY: Too late.
Find your own field.

06:51.433 --> 06:52.467
Mate!

06:53.500 --> 06:54.567
(Distant) Mate!

06:59.333 --> 07:01.300
Come here.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.133
Better be bloody worth it.

07:06.533 --> 07:08.033
What?

07:08.067 --> 07:10.333
Look at these, just pushed up
out of this molehill.

07:10.367 --> 07:12.533
- What are they?
- (Bird chirps)

07:12.567 --> 07:14.133
- Bits of pottery.
- Oh for fu...

07:14.167 --> 07:15.167
Listen.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.633
You know I can't get excited
about stoneware.

07:17.667 --> 07:18.767
Listen a minute.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.233
I've just come from there.
I've got a good signal.

07:21.267 --> 07:24.267
Just look at these, look.
They're black on one side.

07:24.300 --> 07:25.467
So, it's a cooking pot.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.467
No, no, no, it's blackened
on the inside.

07:27.500 --> 07:30.033
I know this stuff.
I recognise it.

07:30.067 --> 07:33.300
I think this was a cremation urn

07:33.333 --> 07:37.133
and this...
this was a Roman burial.

07:42.467 --> 07:44.700
(Bird chirrups)

08:04.733 --> 08:06.800
(Lorry engine starts)

08:09.367 --> 08:10.733
Wait.

08:10.767 --> 08:12.033
Wait a minute!

08:12.067 --> 08:13.367
Wait!

08:35.366 --> 08:36.567
You bastard.

08:38.267 --> 08:39.366
Wasn't my fault.

08:39.400 --> 08:40.633
You told 'em it was here?

08:40.667 --> 08:42.700
- No.
- Then, it was your fault.

08:42.732 --> 08:44.567
It wouldn't have made
any difference.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.733
In fact, it would have made 'em
get rid of it sooner.

08:47.667 --> 08:50.067
What's going on?

08:50.100 --> 08:54.367
Andy, for Christ's sake,
you don't understand, do you?

08:54.400 --> 08:57.467
There's no money to be made from
a little bit of Roman mosaic.

08:57.500 --> 09:00.500
It just slows down construction.

09:00.533 --> 09:02.333
These guys in Dubai,
or wherever it is,

09:02.367 --> 09:05.800
just want their block built, so
they can start making a profit.

09:05.833 --> 09:08.267
So what we even doing here?

09:08.300 --> 09:12.400
You had to lift the flagstone,
didn't you?

09:12.433 --> 09:15.167
If there's one thing I've learnt
from very early in this job

09:15.200 --> 09:17.100
you don't lift the flagstone.

09:17.133 --> 09:19.367
You don't know
what's gonna be underneath.

09:21.567 --> 09:23.067
Right, that's it. I quit.

09:25.700 --> 09:28.400
Tim? I said I'm off.

09:30.133 --> 09:32.200
- For the day?
- No, I'm leaving.

09:32.233 --> 09:34.600
- For the day?
- No, for good.

09:34.633 --> 09:35.833
- So you're quitting?
- Yes.

09:35.867 --> 09:38.267
- Why didn't you say that?
- I did, you didn't hear.

09:38.300 --> 09:40.600
- Would have made this clearer.
- I did say it.

09:40.633 --> 09:41.833
I'll say it again, I quit.

09:41.867 --> 09:44.433
Right.

09:44.467 --> 09:45.633
I'll do the paperwork.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.333
I'm sorry about the mosaic.

09:57.367 --> 09:59.200
See you.

10:08.167 --> 10:09.767
Hi, darling.

10:12.800 --> 10:14.833
Hello, sweetheart.

10:14.867 --> 10:18.400
Oh, all right, Colin. I thought
you was Toni. She about?

10:19.400 --> 10:21.467
Cheers.

10:31.233 --> 10:32.667
Watcha.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.300
- Finished?
- Yeah. You just starting?

10:35.333 --> 10:37.633
Yeah. Nightshift.

10:37.667 --> 10:39.800
Oh, well, ships in the night.

10:43.167 --> 10:45.033
I just called Colin darling.

10:45.067 --> 10:47.667
- Why?
- Thought it was you.

10:47.700 --> 10:49.800
- Because of the beard?
- Yeah.

10:49.833 --> 10:50.833
How did that go down?

10:50.867 --> 10:53.367
Really well. We're having dinner
tomorrow night.

10:53.400 --> 10:56.267
Oh, nice.
He doesn't live on a boat then?

10:56.300 --> 10:59.233
Oh. Sorry.

11:01.533 --> 11:04.200
Wish you hadn't told me
the hypnotism worked.

11:04.233 --> 11:05.467
Well, I thought it had.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.733
You were just humouring me
all along.

11:07.767 --> 11:09.633
Not deliberately.

11:09.667 --> 11:12.033
I...I was humouring myself.

11:12.067 --> 11:15.267
Anyway, I've been thinking.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.800
I'm gonna lend Kate my car so
she can go away this weekend.

11:18.833 --> 11:20.500
- The TR7?
- Yep.

11:20.533 --> 11:24.700
- You'll never do it.
- Yeah, I've decided. I will.

11:24.733 --> 11:26.500
Beggars can't be choosers.

11:26.533 --> 11:29.600
Desperate situations
call for desperate measures.

11:29.633 --> 11:32.133
Beggars can't be choosers?

11:32.167 --> 11:33.767
Who's the beggar, me or you?

11:33.800 --> 11:36.167
That wasn't
a very good choice of words.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.767
Desperate situations?

11:37.800 --> 11:40.233
Yeah, I could have worded that
better as well.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.600
Anyway, my point is that...

11:42.633 --> 11:45.467
I'm not sure I'm up for being
part of a desperate situation.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.167
All feels a bit silly.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.533
Anyway, I was thinking of seeing
my dad this weekend.

11:49.567 --> 11:52.833
No, don't.
Well, do, if you want to,

11:52.867 --> 11:55.600
but I am gonna lend Kate
my car, so...

11:56.767 --> 11:59.433
Yes. There.

12:00.767 --> 12:02.533
Have a good shift.

12:02.567 --> 12:04.500
Drink coffee if you feel tired.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.067
See you.

12:19.100 --> 12:21.033
(Horn honks)

12:33.067 --> 12:34.500
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:34.533 --> 12:36.533
- Guess where we're going.
- Where?

12:36.567 --> 12:38.300
To look at a flat.

12:38.333 --> 12:40.400
- Are we?
- Yes, don't be cross.

12:40.433 --> 12:42.233
I saw it online.
It looked really good,

12:42.267 --> 12:43.500
so I booked an appointment.

12:43.533 --> 12:45.367
Thought we couldn't afford
anything.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.667
Well, I did some sums.
I think I underestimated.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.533
With your job guaranteed,

12:49.567 --> 12:52.733
I think we can get a mortgage
on something like this.

12:55.533 --> 12:58.233
Let's just look at it, see if
it's something we can afford.

12:58.267 --> 12:59.367
Yeah, cool.

12:59.400 --> 13:02.767
How was work today?
How was the mosaic?

13:02.800 --> 13:06.633
Erm...yeah, no, there wasn't
anything left of it after all.

13:06.667 --> 13:08.833
Oh, shame.

13:08.867 --> 13:11.300
Maybe there's more of it
elsewhere.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.533
Yeah, maybe.

13:33.533 --> 13:35.133
(Exhales deeply)

13:37.567 --> 13:40.167
(Door chime)

13:42.567 --> 13:44.567
- Oh...
- Hello.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.667
I'm...looking for Lance.

13:46.700 --> 13:49.633
Are you now? And who might
you be, may I ask?

13:49.667 --> 13:51.267
I'm Maggie.

13:51.300 --> 13:53.767
Well, Maggie, you better get
to the back of the queue,

13:53.800 --> 13:55.433
because that man is mine

13:55.467 --> 13:58.500
and nobody else
is sinking their claws into him.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.133
Oh.

14:00.167 --> 14:03.133
I'm fooling with you.
I'm Kate. I'm Lance's daughter.

14:04.133 --> 14:05.733
- His daughter?
- Yeah.

14:05.767 --> 14:07.033
I get that reaction
a lot actually.

14:07.067 --> 14:10.500
Surprised at my very existence,
like I'm a mythical creature.

14:10.533 --> 14:12.467
- Like a unicorn.
- Exactly.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.100
Or a dolphin.

14:16.133 --> 14:18.700
Is Lance expecting you?
I'm actually just out the door.

14:18.733 --> 14:21.333
Yeah. Yeah, I'm a bit early.

14:21.367 --> 14:25.567
- You better come in and wait.
- Oh, thank you.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.633
Oh, sorry about the mess,
that's my fault.

14:27.667 --> 14:30.433
- Oh, don't worry about that.
- Make yourself a cup of tea.

14:30.467 --> 14:31.567
- Thanks.
- I'll see you.

14:31.600 --> 14:34.533
- It's nice to meet you, Maggie.
- Yeah. Bye, Kate.

14:45.067 --> 14:46.533
Hmm.

14:48.233 --> 14:50.133
Urgh!

15:09.300 --> 15:10.733
ESTATE AGENT: Hello, hi.

15:10.767 --> 15:12.800
Erm...ooh.

15:12.833 --> 15:15.067
Yes, it's all right.

15:15.100 --> 15:16.500
Oops!

15:16.533 --> 15:18.133
Hi.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.300
- Becky?
- Yes.

15:19.333 --> 15:20.433
Kelvin.

15:20.467 --> 15:21.800
This is my husband, Andy.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.667
Thanks for doing this
at short notice.

15:23.700 --> 15:27.167
Fine, no problem. Keys.
That's good. OK.

15:36.867 --> 15:38.733
Smells like a jumbo jet.

15:38.767 --> 15:41.033
Oh, this is a good feature.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.200
Lights on.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.267
Lights on now.

15:49.667 --> 15:51.667
Lights, turn on now.

15:51.700 --> 15:56.333
- There.
- Cool.

15:56.367 --> 15:58.300
And there's voice recognition
with that,

15:58.333 --> 16:00.067
so only you can turn
the lights on.

16:00.100 --> 16:01.200
Why would you do that?

16:01.233 --> 16:05.367
So the...burglars...have to...
use their own torches.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.400
Is there a problem
with burglars?

16:07.433 --> 16:09.300
No.

16:09.333 --> 16:13.567
Er...this is the bathroom.

16:13.600 --> 16:18.033
Underfloor heating throughout
and heated mirror.

16:18.067 --> 16:19.600
Warm reflection?

16:19.633 --> 16:21.433
No condensation.

16:23.167 --> 16:26.033
All the skylights
are hermetically sealed.

16:26.067 --> 16:28.667
So is the air-conditioning
filters.

16:28.700 --> 16:31.767
So it recycles
and, er...sterilises the air,

16:31.800 --> 16:34.067
whilst maintaining
the pressure in the room.

16:39.200 --> 16:42.033
There's a slice of bread
on that skylight.

16:46.333 --> 16:47.667
Oh, yeah.

16:49.867 --> 16:51.600
Seagulls.

16:54.433 --> 16:56.400
This is the front room.

16:57.333 --> 16:59.200
Kitchen.

16:59.233 --> 17:03.033
Washer, dryer, sink, gas.

17:03.067 --> 17:06.599
Hob. One, two, three, four,
with a hood going outside.

17:06.633 --> 17:09.532
Erm...cupboard under the sink

17:09.567 --> 17:13.633
and, er...this is the floor.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.500
And we try to use
as many reclaimed

17:15.532 --> 17:18.133
and recycled materials
as possible.

17:18.166 --> 17:20.200
For instance, these worktops

17:20.233 --> 17:23.467
are actually made from
reconstituted hospitals.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.567
- Hospitals?
- Yep.

17:25.599 --> 17:27.700
Demolished buildings,
ground up and graded

17:27.733 --> 17:29.300
and set in resin.

17:29.333 --> 17:30.800
And you'd never know.
I mean, look.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.133
Oh.

17:33.167 --> 17:34.800
Where do they get
the hospitals from?

17:34.833 --> 17:37.300
- Uganda.
- What about the garden?

17:38.133 --> 17:40.567
The garden is communal.

17:40.600 --> 17:43.233
I can see a shed.
Whose is the shed?

17:43.267 --> 17:44.833
The gardener's.
Comes once a week.

17:44.867 --> 17:47.333
Can I use the shed?

17:47.367 --> 17:50.033
You will not be allowed access
to the shed.

17:56.067 --> 17:57.733
OK, well, nice to meet you.

17:57.767 --> 17:59.533
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

18:01.233 --> 18:02.533
(Drops keys)

18:02.567 --> 18:04.433
It's worse than not
having a shed at all,

18:04.467 --> 18:07.133
having a clear view
of somebody else's shed.

18:07.167 --> 18:10.033
Voice-activated light switches
were a time-saver though.

18:10.067 --> 18:13.533
Sorry, that was as far from my
idea of a home as you can get.

18:13.567 --> 18:16.233
All right. I don't see you
coming up with many options.

18:16.267 --> 18:17.800
No, sorry, I was just saying.

18:17.833 --> 18:20.567
Looks like we're gonna have
a little bit longer to wait.

18:50.167 --> 18:52.400
Ah, morning, Lance.

18:52.433 --> 18:54.433
Morning, Mags, love.

18:57.867 --> 18:59.767
(Cheery humming from bathroom)

19:16.633 --> 19:18.233
(Water bubbling)

19:20.067 --> 19:22.000
(Humming continues)

19:24.833 --> 19:26.033
(Pedal clicks)

19:26.700 --> 19:28.033
(Echoing clatter)

19:28.633 --> 19:30.433
(Exhales)

19:30.467 --> 19:32.000
(Panting)

19:37.100 --> 19:38.700
What?

19:38.733 --> 19:40.133
(Humming continues)

19:44.300 --> 19:46.033
Maggie?

19:46.067 --> 19:47.667
Is that you?

19:49.533 --> 19:54.200
Hello, love. Sorry, you looked
tired, you were yawning.

19:54.233 --> 19:56.767
I'm just having a little bath.
It's all right, innit?

20:00.167 --> 20:02.533
What you doing here...Maggie?

20:04.667 --> 20:07.233
What are you doing here?

20:07.267 --> 20:11.800
Oh, Lance, it was awful.
He turned out to be a real knob.

20:11.833 --> 20:13.200
A wanker, yeah.

20:13.233 --> 20:15.300
- He fooled everyone.
- Well...

20:15.333 --> 20:17.667
How could I have been so stupid?

20:17.700 --> 20:19.567
I couldn't see past his...

20:19.600 --> 20:24.133
..his broad chest
and...manly arms.

20:24.167 --> 20:26.200
Must have been hard to.

20:26.233 --> 20:28.767
You know that Tracey Ullman
song, Fast Car?

20:28.800 --> 20:31.300
- Tracy Chapman, yeah.
- It was like that.

20:31.333 --> 20:33.233
I had a job that paid
all our bills.

20:33.267 --> 20:35.033
He stayed out late
drinking at the bar.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.600
It was exactly like that song.

20:37.633 --> 20:39.833
Except he didn't have
a fast car.

20:39.867 --> 20:42.367
- He had a Toyota Yaris.
- Average.

20:42.400 --> 20:45.067
Listen, Maggie,
you can't stay here.

20:45.100 --> 20:47.033
Oh, it'll only be
for a few nights.

20:47.067 --> 20:49.033
Your daughter's away.
I can have her room.

20:49.067 --> 20:50.500
But I've got a girlfriend.

20:50.533 --> 20:52.300
Have you?

20:52.333 --> 20:54.100
Oh, in't that nice?

20:54.133 --> 20:55.833
You deserve it, Lance.

20:55.867 --> 20:58.133
She's supposed to be staying
the weekend.

20:58.167 --> 21:00.667
(Squeaky voice)
I'll be quiet as a mouse.

21:10.667 --> 21:13.000
Voicemail.

21:13.667 --> 21:15.200
Oh, hi, love.

21:15.233 --> 21:19.233
Ah, sorry, bad timing,
you'll be driving to work.

21:19.267 --> 21:21.600
Anyway,
I-I-I just wanted to tell you,

21:21.633 --> 21:25.367
Kate's decided she's not going
away this weekend.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.567
I offered her to take my car,

21:26.600 --> 21:30.533
but she's got a stinking cold
and she's all tucked up.

21:30.567 --> 21:34.100
So, er...maybe next weekend?

21:34.133 --> 21:38.267
Anyway, give us a call
when you get this message.

21:38.300 --> 21:39.467
Bye.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.567
Aeroplane mode...set.

21:47.867 --> 21:49.367
Slippery slope, mate.

21:51.100 --> 21:52.333
Slippery slope.

22:05.300 --> 22:07.000
(Beeping)

22:08.367 --> 22:10.200
(Low-pitched continuous beep)

22:53.367 --> 22:55.567
(High-pitched beeping)

23:11.333 --> 23:12.700
(Bird chirrups)

23:16.400 --> 23:18.133
Andy!

23:27.167 --> 23:28.700
(Bird chirrups)

23:32.167 --> 23:34.100
(Shutter fails to click)

23:57.600 --> 24:00.567
Got any AA batteries?

24:00.600 --> 24:02.733
- What's that?
- Batteries, double A?

24:02.767 --> 24:04.833
Front pocket of my bag.

24:04.867 --> 24:06.467
You may wanna have
a look at this.

24:06.500 --> 24:08.300
What you got? Roman?

24:10.067 --> 24:11.767
Come and see.

24:11.800 --> 24:14.433
Tell me you've not found gold?
You're acting strangely.

24:14.467 --> 24:17.600
- Have you found gold?
- Maybe I have, maybe I haven't.

24:21.167 --> 24:23.433
- No.
- What?

24:28.200 --> 24:30.633
(Echoing) Noooooooo!

24:37.267 --> 24:39.133
No, no, no!

24:39.167 --> 24:40.833
(Gasping)

24:40.867 --> 24:42.467
Oh, no.

24:42.500 --> 24:44.833
I didn't even touch it,
I...I haven't picked it up.

24:44.867 --> 24:47.267
I wanted to take
a photo of it in situ.

24:47.300 --> 24:50.833
Did you see the glint of gold
as it flew away? Did you see it?

24:50.867 --> 24:52.500
Well, I saw a glint.

24:52.533 --> 24:54.833
To be honest, it looked
more silver in the light.

24:54.867 --> 24:57.700
- You take that back.
- Or copper alloy.

24:59.233 --> 25:00.800
It was gold.

25:07.700 --> 25:09.700
Just swooped down
in one movement

25:09.733 --> 25:12.767
and then it was away over the
trees, never to be seen again.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.567
- Right in front of your eyes?
- Right in front of our eyes.

25:15.600 --> 25:17.367
Hang on, hang on.

25:17.400 --> 25:19.333
Why you telling all this
with such glee?

25:19.367 --> 25:21.700
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

25:21.733 --> 25:25.233
It's like you've become
Mr "I've Got Great News".

25:25.267 --> 25:29.100
Mr "I've Got Exciting News
To Tell Everyone".

25:29.133 --> 25:34.167
Away over the trees,
never to be seen again.

25:34.200 --> 25:38.300
Incredible to witness that.
A magpie stealing a coin.

25:38.333 --> 25:40.167
At least you got
an anecdote out of it.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.633
I don't want an anecdote.

25:41.667 --> 25:46.333
Make a nice children's story.
The Tale Of The Magpie.

25:46.367 --> 25:47.633
I want a gold coin.

25:47.667 --> 25:50.033
And The Greedy Man.

25:50.067 --> 25:52.400
What was it, the coin?

25:52.433 --> 25:55.533
Septimius Severus, I think, but
I didn't even see the obverse.

25:55.567 --> 25:56.867
I didn't touch it.

25:56.900 --> 26:00.600
I don't think you'll be seeing
that again, in my experience.

26:00.633 --> 26:03.567
And what is your experience
of this, Russell?

26:03.600 --> 26:05.100
I'm sorry to snap, mate,

26:05.133 --> 26:07.667
but what experience have you had
of this sort of thing?

26:07.700 --> 26:09.733
Lost a Frisbee once.

26:11.633 --> 26:13.300
HUGH: Did you check your hole?

26:13.333 --> 26:16.133
It wasn't in the hole, Hugh.

26:16.167 --> 26:18.333
I told you,
it came out in the plug.

26:18.367 --> 26:21.267
I know, but you did check
the hole?

26:22.700 --> 26:25.633
You did check your hole,
didn't you, Lance?

26:27.100 --> 26:29.300
Well, I...I...I was in shock.

26:29.333 --> 26:33.267
I...I didn't...
We just ran away.

26:33.300 --> 26:36.233
(Mobile vibrates)

26:36.267 --> 26:37.833
Oh, I gotta...I gotta take this.

26:37.867 --> 26:42.067
How many times?
Always check your hole.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.300
I mean, if that is a burial,
like you think,

26:44.333 --> 26:47.100
with bits of burnt pot, there
could be more gold down there.

26:47.133 --> 26:49.167
I know.
I can't believe he didn't check.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.333
Well, you need to get
down there first thing,

26:51.367 --> 26:53.433
secure the permission.
You should camp out.

26:53.467 --> 26:55.133
Yeah.

26:55.167 --> 26:57.167
Well, I mean, I would
but I don't think Lance

26:57.200 --> 26:58.500
has ever camped in his life.

26:58.533 --> 27:00.367
He likes his creature comforts
too much.

27:01.800 --> 27:03.567
Hello, Mags?

27:03.600 --> 27:04.800
You all right?

27:04.833 --> 27:06.767
Hello, love.

27:06.800 --> 27:10.633
Now, listen, I found a bottle.
Hope you don't mind.

27:10.667 --> 27:13.667
I've already had a glass but
I don't wanna get too giggly.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.200
Ohh.

27:15.233 --> 27:17.200
What time will you be back?

27:19.200 --> 27:20.533
Anyone got a tent?

27:20.567 --> 27:23.400
I reckon we should camp out.

27:25.467 --> 27:28.167
Ah! That's Orion, look,

27:28.200 --> 27:31.333
and, er...that's his belt.

27:31.367 --> 27:35.267
One, two, three in a row.

27:36.600 --> 27:38.167
You see that?

27:38.200 --> 27:41.400
Mate, I'm not five.
I know what Orion looks like.

27:41.433 --> 27:44.567
Show me another constellation,
then I'll be impressed.

27:49.633 --> 27:52.067
You're looking for the Plough,
aren't you?

27:52.100 --> 27:53.767
Yeah.
