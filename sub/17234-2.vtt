00:01.995 --> 00:03.629
<i>Previously on Nashville...</i>

00:03.630 --> 00:06.119
Are you saying she's
not gonna recognize us?

00:06.120 --> 00:08.161
Do you know who the
people in the hallway are?

00:08.592 --> 00:10.246
Were you drunk last
night when you asked me?

00:10.247 --> 00:11.209
When I asked you what?

00:11.766 --> 00:13.085
Rayna!

00:13.086 --> 00:15.072
Thank you all for coming
out here for Rayna.

00:15.073 --> 00:16.360
Thank you. God bless you.

00:16.774 --> 00:17.889
No, man!

00:17.890 --> 00:19.866
You get off me! You
get the hell outta here!

00:19.867 --> 00:22.910
You got a signed record deal.
Rayna's gonna be just fine.

00:22.911 --> 00:25.605
I asked Deacon if he was really my dad,

00:25.606 --> 00:27.806
and then he got drunk
and almost killed my mom.

00:27.807 --> 00:29.541
- Is your hand any better?
- Oh, yeah, it's great.

00:29.542 --> 00:31.015
Listen to me. You quit coming here!

00:34.459 --> 00:36.558
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome Juliette Barnes!

00:38.955 --> 00:40.375
Thank you! Hey, y'all!

00:41.517 --> 00:42.626
How are you?

00:44.805 --> 00:46.005
Thank you.

00:46.655 --> 00:48.026
Hi!

00:50.494 --> 00:52.461
- My God, you look amazing.
- Thank you.

00:52.462 --> 00:54.436
- You look fanta...
- Oh! I like it.

00:54.437 --> 00:55.615
Give you one of those.

00:55.616 --> 00:56.947
Congratulations.

00:56.948 --> 01:00.234
You won C.M.A. Female
vocalist of the year...

01:00.746 --> 01:03.395
Just narrowly edging me out.

01:03.396 --> 01:04.440
I thought I had that.

01:04.861 --> 01:06.414
I think you should have won.

01:06.415 --> 01:08.897
And also, this fantastic new album,

01:08.898 --> 01:11.152
"inside the dream,"

01:11.153 --> 01:13.194
is doing so well.

01:13.195 --> 01:14.390
I'm gonna hire you a driver.

01:14.391 --> 01:17.186
- I want you to take it easy.
- After four weeks in a hospital bed,

01:17.187 --> 01:19.766
- I think I might walk for a while.
- Hey.

01:20.860 --> 01:23.119
Thank you so much for
taking care of everything.

01:23.120 --> 01:25.918
- You bet. I am so glad you're home.
- Me, too.

01:26.248 --> 01:27.302
I'm gonna be staying here

01:27.303 --> 01:28.736
until you're back to a hundred percent.

01:29.612 --> 01:31.099
Well, you don't have to do that.

01:31.597 --> 01:33.747
You know, I don't want this
to be an inconvenience for you.

01:33.748 --> 01:35.687
- My family is not an inconvenience.
- Mom!

01:36.342 --> 01:38.016
- Mom, you're home.
- Oh, my baby girl.

01:38.947 --> 01:41.736
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you so much.

01:45.642 --> 01:47.950
This shot is from two weeks ago

01:47.951 --> 01:50.695
when you held a vigil for
our good friend Rayna Jaymes.

01:50.696 --> 01:53.347
Uh, we wish her a speedy recovery.

01:53.348 --> 01:54.651
We do.

01:54.652 --> 01:56.208
The big news, I guess, we heard that

01:56.209 --> 01:59.128
Rayna got out of the
hospital today, is that right?

01:59.448 --> 02:01.459
That is correct.

02:01.460 --> 02:03.005
I don't think she could
wait to buy my album.

02:03.322 --> 02:04.932
Right, that was the motivation.

02:04.933 --> 02:07.041
- It was. I believe it.
- Yes, that was the sole... All right.

02:07.042 --> 02:08.789
Well, I can't wait to buy your album,

02:08.791 --> 02:10.713
even though I already have a copy.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.995
- That's what a fan I am.
- I want two.

02:12.996 --> 02:14.429
All right, and I understand
you're gonna stick around

02:14.430 --> 02:16.561
- and sing a song for us?
- I would love to.

02:16.562 --> 02:17.918
Very nice. We'll be right back.

02:17.919 --> 02:20.723
- Juliette Barnes in just a second.
- Stick around.

02:21.172 --> 02:22.637
Do you see how Maddie iced me?

02:22.972 --> 02:24.153
Mm-hmm.

02:24.846 --> 02:26.603
She's got a lot of
questions about everything.

02:26.604 --> 02:30.455
- I know. I wish I had the answers.
- Do you have the answers for yourself?

02:30.456 --> 02:32.281
I just remember sitting in that house

02:32.282 --> 02:35.881
after mom died and... Just feeling so lost.

02:37.998 --> 02:40.954
I can't believe I almost
did that to my own daughters

02:40.955 --> 02:42.322
because of him.

02:43.201 --> 02:44.567
Are you gonna talk to him?

02:45.013 --> 02:46.755
I don't know if I'll
ever talk to him again.

02:48.158 --> 02:51.401
- 13 appearances in 2 weeks.
- Tip of the iceberg.

02:51.402 --> 02:52.573
We got records to sell, man.

02:53.454 --> 02:54.774
You know, she seems to like you.

02:55.841 --> 02:58.423
- Hey, great show.
- Yeah, if your definition of "great"

02:58.424 --> 03:00.237
is talking about Rayna the entire time.

03:00.238 --> 03:02.397
I mean, am I ever gonna
be able to do an interview

03:02.398 --> 03:04.308
without having to talk about her?

03:04.309 --> 03:05.866
Shut up!

03:05.867 --> 03:07.727
I didn't... say anything.

03:07.728 --> 03:10.048
I can hear you thinking
from all the way over here.

03:15.690 --> 03:18.183
Hey!

03:18.184 --> 03:20.114
Hey! Look at you. You're home.

03:20.115 --> 03:22.051
- You're not wearing hospital clothes.
- I made it.

03:22.052 --> 03:24.258
I'm not dead.

03:25.854 --> 03:27.404
Mm. You're okay. Yeah.

03:27.405 --> 03:29.251
Uh, sit down. Fill me in.

03:29.252 --> 03:30.646
Tell me what I've been missing.

03:30.647 --> 03:32.950
- Uh, well...
- I can't believe they sold Edgehill.

03:32.951 --> 03:35.720
- Right. Yeah. Marshall
got fired... - Uh-huh.

03:35.721 --> 03:37.366
To the tune of $3 million.

03:37.367 --> 03:40.944
- Oh, fire me for $3 million, please.
- Yeah, right. Um...

03:40.945 --> 03:42.387
New guy's name is Jeff Fordham.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.276
Never heard of him. Is he a creative guy?

03:44.277 --> 03:45.602
No, he's the opposite.

03:45.603 --> 03:48.533
- He's a Harvard MBA Bean counter.
- Oh, man.

03:48.534 --> 03:49.598
Heads are rollin'.

03:49.599 --> 03:51.493
He's meetin' with every single
artist at the label this week.

03:51.494 --> 03:53.135
But we don't have to do that for you yet.

03:53.136 --> 03:54.717
- We don't have to do that til you're ready.
- Yes, we do.

03:54.718 --> 03:55.849
Yes, we do. Are you kidding me?

03:55.850 --> 03:57.597
I know what happens when
these guys get in there.

03:57.598 --> 04:00.234
We gotta get in there... Stand our ground.

04:00.235 --> 04:01.226
Are you sure you're up to it?

04:01.227 --> 04:03.245
I mean, should you even
be talking right now?

04:03.246 --> 04:04.553
Didn't you have an intubation?

04:04.554 --> 04:05.917
You gotta protect your voice, right?

04:05.918 --> 04:08.522
Yeah, but I also gotta protect Highway 65.

04:08.523 --> 04:10.254
We worked so hard to get that goin'.

04:10.255 --> 04:11.972
I gotta protect my label.

04:11.973 --> 04:14.781
Let's get Scarlett and Will,
make it a family affair.

04:19.233 --> 04:20.988
- Mornin'.
- Hey.

04:20.988 --> 04:23.015
- Oh, thank you.
- Sorry, uh...

04:23.016 --> 04:24.050
I didn't want to disturb you.

04:24.051 --> 04:25.811
I was just dropping off the
last of your small stuff.

04:25.812 --> 04:28.808
Oh. Zoey's gonna come by the house and, uh,

04:28.809 --> 04:30.480
pick up the furniture in
the carport and the couch.

04:31.503 --> 04:34.060
- The couch kinda got, uh...
-  Damaged.

04:34.782 --> 04:37.037
- Like, torn, or...
- Torched.

04:38.169 --> 04:40.191
Uh, this should cover it.

04:40.608 --> 04:41.863
Um...

04:43.552 --> 04:44.904
How are you?

04:44.905 --> 04:46.764
Fine, I guess.

04:46.765 --> 04:50.482
Jeannie's all over me to get
some new songs turned in. And...

04:50.483 --> 04:51.827
The melodies are coming fine,

04:51.828 --> 04:54.013
but I've been a little
stuck with the lyrics lately.

04:55.659 --> 04:56.886
I don't suppose you wanna

04:57.597 --> 05:00.157
get together this week and
throw some ideas around,

05:00.158 --> 05:01.842
maybe... knock something out?

05:02.313 --> 05:04.385
I'm not sure it's the best idea right now.

05:04.386 --> 05:06.112
Yeah, you're right. It's a terrible idea.

05:06.113 --> 05:07.077
No...

05:07.569 --> 05:10.675
I have to go. Um, thank
you, and have a lovely day.

05:10.989 --> 05:15.261
Yeah, uh, I-I'm busy. I
gotta... I gotta go, too. Busy.

05:15.262 --> 05:16.407
Well, it's good to finally see someone

05:16.408 --> 05:18.063
young and interesting in this office.

05:18.717 --> 05:21.315
Well, you guys have been
very welcoming to me.

05:21.316 --> 05:23.462
You're in Nashville. Now
you gotta say, "y'all."

05:23.463 --> 05:25.078
<i>Y'all.</i>

05:25.379 --> 05:27.970
Unfortunately, it seems
the public hasn't been

05:27.971 --> 05:30.417
as welcoming of your latest effort.

05:30.778 --> 05:32.581
Your album's been sliding on iTunes,

05:32.953 --> 05:34.515
and your single hasn't
made it to number one.

05:34.516 --> 05:36.271
The tweens are not showing up on this one.

05:36.272 --> 05:38.313
Her audience is growing up with her.

05:38.314 --> 05:40.334
I'm moving toward a...

05:40.335 --> 05:42.399
New, more mature sound.

05:42.400 --> 05:43.815
You know, the bubblegum and glitter

05:43.816 --> 05:45.604
just aren't things I care about anymore.

05:46.927 --> 05:48.302
Well, I do.

05:49.104 --> 05:50.347
They move records.

05:50.348 --> 05:51.967
Either way, your album's getting outsold

05:51.968 --> 05:55.349
by "the best of Rayna Jaymes."
So even your "mature sound"

05:55.350 --> 05:57.274
isn't winning mature audiences.

05:57.275 --> 05:59.922
Would you like for me to go have
my own near-death experience?

06:00.291 --> 06:02.330
Look...

06:03.098 --> 06:06.007
You chose to walk down
this more mature path.

06:06.008 --> 06:07.522
You'll figure something out.

06:07.523 --> 06:08.878
Now I'm having a little get-together

06:08.879 --> 06:10.411
at my place the night after tomorrow.

06:10.412 --> 06:13.345
Just artists, no press.
I hope you can make it.

06:13.346 --> 06:15.056
It was really, really nice to meet you.

06:15.908 --> 06:17.172
I'm a big fan.

06:19.836 --> 06:21.370
Hey, Scarlett.

06:22.178 --> 06:23.567
Oh, my God.

06:24.466 --> 06:25.344
Oh.

06:25.345 --> 06:26.782
I'm so glad you're all right.

06:26.783 --> 06:28.281
Me, too.

06:28.282 --> 06:30.493
I can't believe they're making
you do this today, though.

06:30.494 --> 06:32.666
You know what? They're not. I insisted.

06:33.156 --> 06:34.643
No time like the present.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.600
Uh, on that note, um...

06:36.903 --> 06:38.760
I'm staying with Deacon at the moment.

06:38.761 --> 06:40.921
And I know you guys aren't really talking.

06:40.922 --> 06:42.264
I still don't know what happened...

06:42.265 --> 06:43.845
Why he fell off the wagon.

06:43.846 --> 06:46.848
I just wanted to ask you if it was weird...

06:47.162 --> 06:49.559
You and I working together
while I'm living with him.

06:49.560 --> 06:51.660
I don't wanna make you
uncomfortable in any way.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.199
Listen, in Nashville,

06:53.200 --> 06:55.142
if everybody who had a
complicated relationship

06:55.143 --> 06:57.338
stopped working together, we
would never get a thing done.

06:57.339 --> 06:59.438
- Okay. We're good.
- Ladies, hello. Ah!

06:59.439 --> 07:02.649
There he is... The
other half of Highway 65.

07:02.650 --> 07:04.715
There is no way you just
got out of the hospital

07:04.716 --> 07:06.130
and you look this beautiful.

07:06.131 --> 07:08.235
You can save that charm
for the man upstairs.

07:09.457 --> 07:10.625
Rayna.

07:10.626 --> 07:12.496
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:13.206 --> 07:15.306
Uh, wow. Um...

07:15.307 --> 07:16.626
I thought you'd be at home

07:16.627 --> 07:18.506
just laying low, takin' care of yourself.

07:18.507 --> 07:20.370
Can't keep me down.

07:20.371 --> 07:23.175
Hey, I saw those pictures
of that prayer vigil you did.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.037
Thank you.

07:24.038 --> 07:26.065
Well, I'm glad it worked.

07:26.066 --> 07:27.177
Me, too.

07:29.226 --> 07:30.288
Hey.

07:31.191 --> 07:33.990
- How's the new guy?
- He's an ass.

07:33.991 --> 07:35.981
Ms. Jaymes.

07:35.982 --> 07:37.982
- Hey.
- Ah, it's a real pleasure.

07:37.983 --> 07:39.408
I've been looking forward
to meeting the woman

07:39.409 --> 07:40.807
who built Edgehill.

07:40.808 --> 07:42.695
- Thank you. I appreciate that.
- Yeah.

07:42.696 --> 07:45.403
And I'm not sure that
you have met my manager...

07:45.404 --> 07:46.871
- Bucky Dawes.
- Hey, Bucky.

07:46.872 --> 07:48.482
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

07:48.483 --> 07:51.407
And the first 2 artists
of Highway 65 Records...

07:51.408 --> 07:53.448
Scarlett o'Connor and Will Lexington.

07:53.449 --> 07:54.916
Pleased to meet you.

07:54.917 --> 07:56.640
- Nice dress.
-  Hey.

07:56.641 --> 07:58.816
- Welcome to Nashville.
- Thank you, man.

07:58.817 --> 08:00.207
So...

08:00.539 --> 08:03.942
Now between your demos and the fact that

08:03.943 --> 08:06.545
Ms. Jaymes' catalog is
selling like wildfire,

08:06.885 --> 08:10.209
this... this was the meeting
that I was most excited to have.

08:10.210 --> 08:13.172
We launched Highway 65
at the Opry last month,

08:13.173 --> 08:16.236
and, uh, we had just gotten
into budgets with Marshall.

08:16.237 --> 08:18.033
Yeah, he was being none too generous.

08:18.034 --> 08:20.202
Uh, well, that's because, respectfully,

08:20.203 --> 08:21.758
he didn't know how to grow a business.

08:22.090 --> 08:24.922
I'm all for investing
in what you believe in.

08:25.293 --> 08:26.697
Okay? And I feel like I am looking

08:26.698 --> 08:28.830
at the future of Edgehill right now.

08:30.236 --> 08:32.975
Ms. Jaymes, I-I know
what you've been through.

08:33.857 --> 08:36.427
And I want you to get healthy. Get strong.

08:36.428 --> 08:37.597
I got your back.

08:45.356 --> 08:47.220
- You want some dinner?
- No.

08:47.221 --> 08:48.772
I don't want you cooking for me either.

08:49.424 --> 08:51.505
I ain't cooking. I just
think you should eat.

08:52.117 --> 08:54.050
You know, you need to get off
my back a little bit, all right?

08:54.051 --> 08:55.890
- Can you do that?
- Juliette made an appointment

08:55.891 --> 08:57.612
for you to see the specialist tomorrow.

08:58.813 --> 08:59.870
God...

08:59.871 --> 09:03.488
Damn it, Scarlett. My hand will
heal when my hand heals, okay?

09:03.489 --> 09:04.635
You tell her I'm not goin'.

09:04.636 --> 09:06.855
Are you angry at me for working with Rayna?

09:07.356 --> 09:08.185
What?

09:08.186 --> 09:09.778
Well, she said it
doesn't bother her, but...

09:10.861 --> 09:13.562
Somethin' sure is bothering you about me.

09:13.563 --> 09:15.440
No.

09:18.012 --> 09:19.206
No, Scarlett.

09:20.410 --> 09:22.178
There ain't nothin'
about you that bothers me.

09:22.179 --> 09:24.300
I'm sorry. You...

09:24.849 --> 09:27.646
Your career's taking
off. That is a good thing.

09:27.647 --> 09:29.331
It makes me happy. It makes me proud.

09:29.332 --> 09:30.861
And you're doing it with
Rayna. That's good, too.

09:30.862 --> 09:33.838
It's all good. You know? It's just...

09:34.890 --> 09:35.959
What?

09:38.214 --> 09:42.613
The art of this... You
get that part, you know?

09:42.614 --> 09:44.611
You get it. That part... That's beautiful.

09:44.612 --> 09:47.637
But this business... It can eat you alive.

09:49.505 --> 09:51.527
I just want you to be careful.

10:51.427 --> 10:52.539
Will...

10:52.540 --> 10:54.017
Great show, man.

10:54.018 --> 10:55.977
Wow. Thanks.

10:55.978 --> 10:57.655
Jeff, I just can't believe you're here.

10:58.221 --> 11:00.062
You are the future of country music.

11:00.063 --> 11:02.861
Well, I can't tell you how
glad I am to hear you say that.

11:02.862 --> 11:04.224
I mean, I-I'm really excited

11:04.225 --> 11:06.343
to work with Edgehill and Highway 65.

11:07.717 --> 11:10.277
Hey... give us a minute, all right?

11:10.278 --> 11:11.428
Sure.

11:11.429 --> 11:13.860
Here you go.

11:15.231 --> 11:17.079
See, here's the thing, Will...

11:17.080 --> 11:18.644
You haven't signed your contract yet

11:18.645 --> 11:20.162
with Highway 65.

11:20.163 --> 11:22.637
You say the word... We start over.

11:22.638 --> 11:24.976
We build you a new deal with the big dog...

11:24.977 --> 11:26.264
Edgehill itself.

11:26.265 --> 11:28.206
We will set you up with
a national radio tour,

11:28.207 --> 11:30.418
priority status, tour support,

11:30.739 --> 11:33.013
all of our resources
and a full-court press.

11:33.014 --> 11:34.378
I still get to work with Rayna?

11:35.810 --> 11:36.968
No.

11:36.969 --> 11:39.045
Rayna's label is like the farm team,

11:39.046 --> 11:40.945
and I'm inviting you to the majors.

11:40.946 --> 11:42.419
You want to play?

Synced and corrected by
Nantinha ~ www.addic7ed.com ~

11:59.625 --> 12:02.249
- Can we have a little chat?
-  I think I'm good.

12:04.267 --> 12:06.729
I'd really love to just, uh...

12:06.730 --> 12:08.636
I'd love to know what's on your mind.

12:09.193 --> 12:10.932
Hmm, I don't know.

12:10.933 --> 12:12.915
Maybe... what happens now?

12:13.297 --> 12:15.281
Well, I don't know.

12:15.282 --> 12:16.922
Let's figure it out together.

12:16.923 --> 12:19.207
Am I supposed to treat
Deacon like another dad?

12:19.709 --> 12:22.891
Do I split my time between
you, daddy, and Deacon?

12:22.892 --> 12:25.026
Or am I just supposed to pretend

12:25.027 --> 12:26.370
like I don't know about Deacon

12:26.859 --> 12:29.206
and act like everything's
the way it used to be?

12:29.924 --> 12:31.111
What about Daphne?

12:31.425 --> 12:33.998
Honey, I know all this is so confusing...

12:33.999 --> 12:35.362
I'm not confused.

12:36.100 --> 12:37.311
My mom's a liar,

12:37.935 --> 12:39.954
my biological dad's an alcoholic,

12:40.495 --> 12:42.543
my dad isn't even my dad.

12:42.544 --> 12:44.125
What's confusing about that?

12:46.899 --> 12:48.736
I'm really sorry you
see it that way, honey.

12:48.737 --> 12:50.511
Yeah, this was a great talk.

12:56.347 --> 12:58.492
For God sake, give me
a different photographer

12:58.493 --> 13:00.117
'cause I have to have
pictures I can actually use.

13:00.118 --> 13:01.774
What the hell are you doing here, man?

13:01.775 --> 13:03.251
- Are you stalkin' me, Brent?
- Relax, would you?

13:03.252 --> 13:05.515
I'm here with my boss. Your boss?

13:05.516 --> 13:06.886
- I was trying...
- I see you met Brent.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.302
Yeah. He's my marketing and P.R. Guy.

13:08.303 --> 13:10.237
It took some convincing to
get him out here from L.A.,

13:10.238 --> 13:12.705
but I can be pretty
persuasive when I wanna be.

13:13.403 --> 13:15.060
Y'all are gonna make a great team.

13:17.193 --> 13:17.917
Good night.

13:25.129 --> 13:26.189
Welcome aboard, sir.

13:26.190 --> 13:27.455
I'll take that for you.

13:28.283 --> 13:30.232
- Where's the gig?
- No gig.

13:30.718 --> 13:33.228
Headin' down to Alabama for the day.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.935
What's in Alabama?

13:34.936 --> 13:37.109
New head of the label's
trying to prove he's got balls

13:37.110 --> 13:38.578
by bustin' mine,

13:38.579 --> 13:40.048
which I'm not gonna let happen.

13:40.049 --> 13:41.603
He basically suggested

13:41.604 --> 13:43.637
that I fake my own death to boost sales.

13:44.488 --> 13:47.437
I came up with a better idea... Alabama.

13:48.548 --> 13:50.303
- I don't get it.
- Well...

13:50.304 --> 13:52.604
I've had a CMT Special
on the books for a while

13:52.605 --> 13:53.950
to promote the album.

13:53.951 --> 13:55.195
And they decided they were willing

13:55.196 --> 13:56.264
to take a little trip for me.

13:56.265 --> 13:57.946
So considering I don't
feel like dying today,

13:58.253 --> 14:00.114
I figured I'd give them
the next best thing...

14:00.115 --> 14:01.438
A little look at where I come from.

14:01.439 --> 14:04.770
So if there's no gig, what am I doing here?

14:05.556 --> 14:07.424
Don't read too much into it.

14:07.425 --> 14:08.869
I got some ideas for new songs,

14:08.870 --> 14:10.732
and we'll be working on this flight.

14:10.733 --> 14:12.689
- Hi.
- Hey.

14:12.690 --> 14:14.614
Can I get you anything? Water, tea,

14:14.615 --> 14:17.177
whiskey?

14:17.478 --> 14:19.209
You gonna help me break the rules now?

14:19.210 --> 14:21.332
Uh, you know me... Mr. rebellious.

14:21.333 --> 14:23.595
Oh, I know. I know.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.067
Hey, thank you.

14:25.520 --> 14:28.906
I know neither one of us
ever expected to be here.

14:28.907 --> 14:30.350
- But...
- Yeah.

14:32.436 --> 14:35.651
Look, we have raised some
amazing girls together.

14:35.652 --> 14:37.558
And I am always gonna be there for them...

14:38.263 --> 14:39.716
And you.

14:43.658 --> 14:46.179
Rayna? Oh...

14:46.180 --> 14:47.002
Sorry.

14:47.003 --> 14:48.125
Oh, no, it's good. Buck's here.

14:48.126 --> 14:49.989
He's gonna help me get through
all this contract stuff.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.620
I want to try to get
a handle on this today.

14:51.621 --> 14:52.946
Well, you're probably gonna need to.

14:52.947 --> 14:54.489
'Cause, uh, I just found out that Jeff...

14:54.950 --> 14:56.302
Is trying to poach will.

14:56.303 --> 14:58.187
- What?
- Yeah, he went to his show last night,

14:58.188 --> 15:00.252
basically suggested he ditch Highway 65.

15:00.253 --> 15:01.961
Are you kiddin' me?

15:01.962 --> 15:02.898
Mnh-mnh.

15:07.433 --> 15:08.973
What the hell's that?

15:08.974 --> 15:11.014
That has been there since the accident.

15:16.503 --> 15:18.480
Unless they moved it,
the store's back that way.

15:18.481 --> 15:19.642
I know.

15:19.968 --> 15:21.598
And yet you won't turn around, huh?

15:21.599 --> 15:23.522
We're not going to the grocery store.

15:23.523 --> 15:26.087
- We're not going to the grocery store.
- You have a doctor's appointment.

15:28.088 --> 15:30.180
I told you I wasn't going to the doctor's.

15:30.181 --> 15:32.473
- All right? - Yeah,
but y-you were wrong.

15:33.516 --> 15:34.982
- I was wrong?
- Mm.

15:34.983 --> 15:37.139
- Oh... Scarlett, stop the car.
- Nope.

15:37.140 --> 15:38.717
Scarlett, I'm not jokin' around.

15:38.718 --> 15:40.089
Shut up!

15:40.507 --> 15:42.110
I know you don't want to go.
I know you're afraid of what

15:42.111 --> 15:43.865
they're gonna say about your
hand, but were going anyway,

15:43.866 --> 15:46.748
all right? So just... sit there.

15:53.440 --> 15:54.832
Home sweet home.

16:00.622 --> 16:01.904
You okay?

16:02.498 --> 16:03.848
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:05.022 --> 16:07.189
Hey, y'all! How are ya?

16:07.190 --> 16:08.864
- Hi, Juliette.
-  Katie, good to see you.

16:08.865 --> 16:10.067
John Hamlin. Nice to meet you.

16:10.941 --> 16:12.634
♪ When I want a beer

16:12.635 --> 16:14.577

16:20.664 --> 16:23.373
♪ Go get me one... dear

16:23.921 --> 16:26.442

- You writin' a song, or a...

Jingle for a commercial?

16:29.219 --> 16:30.564
You're funny.

16:31.413 --> 16:33.237
It's 4:00 P.M. you just gettin' up?

16:33.897 --> 16:36.491
Yeah, I couldn't sleep last night.

16:39.188 --> 16:41.219
Jeff Fordham came to my gig.

16:42.575 --> 16:45.674
He wants me to ditch
Highway 65 for Edgehill,

16:45.675 --> 16:47.142
but I don't know. I...

16:51.249 --> 16:54.195
There's this guy Brent I
used to know in Austin...

16:54.196 --> 16:55.581
Look, man, I'm not the guy to help you

16:55.582 --> 16:56.948
with your high-class problem

16:56.949 --> 16:59.053
of which record label
to sign with right now.

16:59.054 --> 17:00.730
I am trying to write a
song that doesn't suck

17:00.731 --> 17:02.677
so Jeannie doesn't kill my publishing deal.

17:02.678 --> 17:03.800
Okay, well, it's not my fault

17:03.801 --> 17:06.132
you're banging your head up
against your writer's block...

17:06.133 --> 17:08.454
- Hoping it'll crumble.
- It's not my fault you're complaining about

17:08.455 --> 17:12.060
being in a situation everybody
we know would kill to be in.

17:12.061 --> 17:13.470
Hey, guys.

17:13.471 --> 17:14.605
Door was open.

17:14.606 --> 17:17.012
I'm just coming by to pick
up any unburnt furniture.

17:17.417 --> 17:18.926
- Ms. Jaymes. Ms. Jaymes!
-  I don't... There's no numbers here.

17:19.326 --> 17:20.221
Excuse me. Excuse me, gentlemen.

17:20.222 --> 17:22.479
- Please, can I have a word with you?
- Yeah.

17:22.480 --> 17:23.902
So was all that sweet talk yesterday

17:23.903 --> 17:25.374
about, oh, you got my
back... All that business,

17:25.375 --> 17:26.848
that was just so you
could cover up the fact

17:26.848 --> 17:28.200
you were gonna poach my artist?

17:28.201 --> 17:30.118
Look, I was just going
after a talented performer

17:30.119 --> 17:32.277
- without a signed contract.
- Uh, I think my lawyer

17:32.278 --> 17:33.724
would beg to differ with you about that.

17:33.725 --> 17:36.397
Highway 65 and will
have a verbal agreement.

17:36.398 --> 17:39.882
Well, my lawyers... plural...
Don't see it that way.

17:40.285 --> 17:42.441
Look, Rayna, we don't have
to fight about this, okay?

17:42.442 --> 17:44.867
Will can make his choice.
I am not forcing him.

17:47.094 --> 17:48.973
Is this really how you
want to start with me?

17:48.974 --> 17:51.194
Your fledgling label is not the right place

17:51.499 --> 17:54.930
- for an artist with Will's potential.
- My fledgling label?

17:55.265 --> 17:58.363
Yesterday, my fledgling label was
"the future of edgehill." No... no.

17:58.364 --> 18:00.200
Let me clarify, okay?

18:00.201 --> 18:01.524
I think that your back catalog

18:01.525 --> 18:03.333
and will Lexington are
where I want my money.

18:03.334 --> 18:05.163
My back catalog, not my new stuff.

18:05.164 --> 18:06.897
Will Lexington, not Scarlett?

18:06.898 --> 18:08.457
It's nothing personal.

18:08.458 --> 18:09.917
I'm not letting you take will from me.

18:09.918 --> 18:11.964
Okay. Best of luck.

18:11.965 --> 18:13.419
You go ahead and keep that luck.

18:13.420 --> 18:14.831
I make my own luck.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.968
It's really brave of you to come home,

18:23.969 --> 18:26.059
especially with everything
you've been through.

18:26.547 --> 18:28.609
- We're ready, guys. Are you ready?
- Yeah.

18:28.610 --> 18:30.688
All right. We have speed.
Anytime you're ready. Okay.

18:31.033 --> 18:34.213
I'm here with Juliette
Barnes in Enterprise, Alabama,

18:34.214 --> 18:36.039
where she lived until she was 15.

18:36.892 --> 18:38.353
What's it like to come home?

18:39.256 --> 18:41.411
Uh, its great, you know?

18:41.412 --> 18:43.428
I get to reconnect with where I'm from.

18:47.423 --> 18:48.907
Miss Carrie?

18:48.908 --> 18:50.427
I can't believe you're still here.

18:55.640 --> 18:59.356
Uh... uh, this is miss,
uh, Carrie Franklin.

18:59.357 --> 19:02.391
She... she lived two trailers down from us.

19:02.392 --> 19:04.017
So you knew Juliette Barnes

19:04.018 --> 19:05.912
before she was "Juliette Barnes"?

19:05.913 --> 19:09.391
Mm-hmm. She used to come
over to my house for hours,

19:09.392 --> 19:11.228
and we'd make peanut butter cookies.

19:11.229 --> 19:14.318
- Remember?
- Yeah, uh...

19:14.319 --> 19:17.666
Carrie used to help when I was home alone.

19:18.032 --> 19:19.986
I made you somethin'.

19:22.451 --> 19:24.810
Those are all you.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.503
That's really nice.

19:29.707 --> 19:33.264
I followed you every step of the way.

19:33.265 --> 19:35.192
Every step. Take it.

19:35.193 --> 19:36.548
It's for you.

19:37.865 --> 19:39.146
Thank you.

19:39.147 --> 19:42.068
- Oh.
-  Okay.

19:42.069 --> 19:44.514
Ladies, we're good. We're good. Thank you.

19:45.175 --> 19:46.649
Thanks, Juliette and Miss Carrie.

19:50.130 --> 19:51.695
Come on. Come with me.

19:52.129 --> 19:53.393
Come over here.

19:53.394 --> 19:54.716
That's a nice quilt.

19:55.353 --> 19:56.558
You like it?

19:57.475 --> 19:58.886
Keep it.

20:01.676 --> 20:02.624
I want you to know, Rayna,

20:02.625 --> 20:04.117
I didn't go looking for any of this.

20:04.118 --> 20:05.289
Oh, I know.

20:05.290 --> 20:08.372
This is a great opportunity
for you to really think about

20:08.373 --> 20:09.977
what it is that you want.

20:10.701 --> 20:12.892
And you can make that
decision for yourself.

20:13.417 --> 20:14.983
How long you want to be doing this?

20:14.984 --> 20:16.354
A year? Two years?

20:16.808 --> 20:17.952
You want to have the kind of career

20:17.953 --> 20:19.892
that's worthy of that stage right there?

20:19.893 --> 20:21.403
And I get it. I know it's flattering

20:21.404 --> 20:23.879
to have the head of a label tell you that

20:23.880 --> 20:26.976
you're the future of country music.

20:26.977 --> 20:28.735
Right?

20:29.923 --> 20:33.381
But just remember, it's
just words coming from him.

20:33.382 --> 20:35.805
He is a businessman, and I promise you...

20:36.494 --> 20:40.168
The only thing he cares about
is what his research tells him

20:40.169 --> 20:42.465
is gonna sell the most units this month.

20:42.466 --> 20:45.692
Next month, it's gonna be
something or someone else

20:45.693 --> 20:47.548
completely different.

20:47.549 --> 20:48.710
I don't know you that well,

20:48.711 --> 20:50.705
but I feel like we could
do something really special.

20:53.672 --> 20:55.648
I feel like you really want it.

20:55.649 --> 20:56.962
Yes, ma'am.

20:57.852 --> 21:00.986
I want you to be at Highway 65 with me

21:00.987 --> 21:03.801
so that I can protect you as an artist.

21:03.802 --> 21:06.968
I want you to be able to
grow and find your voice

21:06.969 --> 21:09.029
and really know who you are,

21:09.030 --> 21:12.052
and I will always have your back.

21:13.819 --> 21:15.030
You might wanna ask yourself

21:15.031 --> 21:17.027
if you could say the same thing about Jeff.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.818
Sorry about before with Will.

21:24.154 --> 21:26.063
Oh, no, it seemed totally normal,

21:26.064 --> 21:28.323
not at all like you were jealous.

21:28.324 --> 21:30.453
But given what happened to you...

21:30.454 --> 21:31.808
What?

21:31.809 --> 21:34.178
Uh, your brother passing.

21:34.897 --> 21:36.330
How'd you know about my brother?

21:36.331 --> 21:38.232
Dude, I'm Scarlett's best friend.

21:38.542 --> 21:39.763
I know that.

21:40.886 --> 21:42.376
- All right, what else did she tell you?
- Um...

21:42.692 --> 21:45.247
Pretty much everything.

21:45.248 --> 21:48.071
Okay. Everything. Wow. Wow.

21:48.072 --> 21:49.953
Including your writer's block.

21:49.954 --> 21:51.196
What?

21:51.197 --> 21:52.381
Look, this is weird, all right?

21:52.382 --> 21:53.593
You know everything about me.

21:53.594 --> 21:55.224
And I know that you're
a preacher's daughter.

21:55.225 --> 21:56.998
How about you tell me
something about yourself,

21:56.999 --> 22:00.258
- you know, even this up a little bit?
- We're not talking about me.

22:00.259 --> 22:02.692
Look, I don't know anything about writing,

22:02.693 --> 22:05.444
but you've got a broken heart.

22:05.445 --> 22:07.573
What more do you need for a song?

22:07.574 --> 22:09.606
Good rhyme for "beer."

22:09.607 --> 22:11.516
Ah! "Souvenir"...

22:12.001 --> 22:15.271
"Insincere"... "Persevere."

22:15.272 --> 22:17.285
So he held your hand?

22:17.286 --> 22:18.915
- Sort of.
- Like...

22:18.916 --> 22:22.286
Sort of maybe this is...
Heading someplace sort of?

22:22.287 --> 22:23.886
He's been very helpful.

22:23.887 --> 22:26.046
- I appreciate
that. - Mm-hmm.

22:26.047 --> 22:27.593
I mean, lord knows I need help right now.

22:28.552 --> 22:29.732
I can't believe all the stuff

22:29.733 --> 22:31.520
that's happening with Highway 65.

22:31.521 --> 22:33.717
I might actually lose one of my artists.

22:33.718 --> 22:35.996
My other artist just moved in with Deacon.

22:36.297 --> 22:38.589
<i>And I don't know when I'm
gonna be able to tour again.</i>

22:38.590 --> 22:40.374
Scarlett must moved in with Deacon?

22:40.375 --> 22:41.465
Mm-hmm.

22:41.466 --> 22:42.809
Did he tell her about Maddie?

22:42.810 --> 22:46.204
No. Not yet. But, you know,
that's just a matter of time.

22:46.205 --> 22:48.352
I mean...  Blood is thicker than water.

22:49.573 --> 22:51.247
Well, you're at the point where

22:51.248 --> 22:52.825
you could start physical therapy.

22:52.826 --> 22:54.193
We'll have to monitor you closely

22:54.194 --> 22:56.105
to make sure you don't reinjure the hand.

22:56.106 --> 22:58.556
I'm not gonna lie to you. It'll be painful.

22:58.557 --> 23:02.115
Well...  How long till my hand is normal?

23:02.116 --> 23:04.236
- How long till I can play?
- I wanna be clear.

23:04.237 --> 23:07.010
You suffered extensive damage
to your nerves and tendons.

23:07.011 --> 23:09.275
You may never get back
to your version of normal.

23:09.276 --> 23:12.657
And you just said, "may,"
so... with the therapy

23:12.658 --> 23:14.549
there is a chance he
might could get better?

23:14.550 --> 23:16.335
Well, yeah, but with injuries like these,

23:16.336 --> 23:17.945
we never guarantee that he will get back

23:17.946 --> 23:19.529
- his full range of motion...
- What do I gotta do

23:19.530 --> 23:21.405
to make this thing stop
hurting me right now?

23:22.532 --> 23:24.796
- If you're not gonna take the pain meds...
- I'm not.

23:26.122 --> 23:27.520
We can immobilize it.

23:27.877 --> 23:29.468
- Like a cast?
- Yes.

23:29.469 --> 23:31.504
But the longer you put
off physical therapy,

23:31.505 --> 23:33.819
we risk making the
temporary damage permanent.

23:33.820 --> 23:36.618
Do it. Give me the cast.

23:36.619 --> 23:39.320
No, hang on. You... You got to
at least try physical therapy.

23:39.321 --> 23:40.658
I don't gotta do anything, all
right? I don't gotta do anything.

23:40.659 --> 23:42.069
If there's any chance that
your hand could get better...

23:42.070 --> 23:44.446
Look, we come here and get some answers...
Find out what the story is. Now we know.

23:44.447 --> 23:46.326
My hand's not gonna be the same again.

23:46.327 --> 23:47.799
Give me the cast, please.

24:02.526 --> 24:03.911
Please don't punch me.

24:03.912 --> 24:05.006
What do you want?

24:06.434 --> 24:08.355
I-I know what you're afraid of.

24:08.356 --> 24:10.498
I just wanna tell you
that you don't have to be.

24:10.499 --> 24:12.608
- I get it.
- You get what?

24:12.609 --> 24:14.331
You're an incredibly valuable asset

24:14.332 --> 24:15.990
as the ladies' man that you are.

24:15.991 --> 24:17.457
And I'm not an idiot.

24:17.458 --> 24:19.619
Look, my boss thinks
you're the next big thing.

24:20.641 --> 24:22.700
I'm not gonna be the guy who ruins that.

24:22.701 --> 24:25.500
So if you could stop
jumping out of your skin

24:25.501 --> 24:26.768
every time you that you see me,

24:27.707 --> 24:29.230
I'd appreciate it.

24:31.001 --> 24:32.646
What if I choose Rayna?

24:33.625 --> 24:35.196
Whatever you decide.

24:36.265 --> 24:38.077
You're just gonna have to trust me.

24:54.374 --> 24:55.571
When we moved here,

24:55.572 --> 24:57.862
my mama hated that it was stark white.

24:57.863 --> 24:59.162
So...

24:59.490 --> 25:02.007
We painted it this happy yellow.

25:02.478 --> 25:06.093
My mom and dad let me pick the color.

25:06.862 --> 25:09.242
You've never really
mentioned your father before.

25:09.243 --> 25:10.688
Well, he was, uh,

25:10.689 --> 25:13.140
part of something I locked away.

25:14.294 --> 25:16.071
We moved here when I was 3.

25:19.217 --> 25:21.711
He actually made this for me

25:22.369 --> 25:23.601
for my 4th birthday...

25:25.815 --> 25:27.981
Right before he passed away.

25:32.893 --> 25:34.828
Yeah, when you're a kid, you just...

25:36.333 --> 25:38.410
You don't see the bad. You just...

25:40.691 --> 25:42.835
See a happy yellow house.

25:46.409 --> 25:48.517
Can we cut, please?

25:48.518 --> 25:49.757
Let's stop here.

25:49.758 --> 25:51.061
Juliette, I'm so sorry.

25:51.062 --> 25:53.118
I didn't know you'd lost your father, too.

25:53.119 --> 25:54.451
Thank you.

26:06.326 --> 26:07.570
Do you, uh...

26:09.034 --> 26:10.833
You wanna talk about it?

26:13.157 --> 26:15.554
I'm just trying to sell records.

26:38.634 --> 26:41.367
Thank you... for coming.

26:43.374 --> 26:46.538
It's almost like everybody
expected we were gonna die.

26:47.117 --> 26:48.379
I gotta be honest,

26:48.380 --> 26:50.334
sometimes it feels like I did.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.786
I don't know if I'm gonna
be able to play anymore.

26:59.504 --> 27:01.894
I don't know if the program's gonna work,

27:02.219 --> 27:04.122
or...

27:05.588 --> 27:07.167
I wasn't gonna call you.

27:08.334 --> 27:09.936
I didn't want to.

27:12.089 --> 27:13.589
I had no right.

27:14.888 --> 27:17.600
It's just, I didn't know who else to call.

27:18.275 --> 27:20.313
I don't want you to be the one. I just...

27:25.907 --> 27:27.594
You always have been.

27:30.486 --> 27:32.636
I can't.

27:32.637 --> 27:34.667
We've been through this so many times,

27:34.668 --> 27:36.684
and we've tried so hard, and...

27:39.995 --> 27:42.673
We've just brought each
other so much grief.

27:45.142 --> 27:46.870
And we didn't die here.

27:50.322 --> 27:51.550
And I think that means

27:51.551 --> 27:53.671
that maybe we have an opportunity

27:54.906 --> 27:56.419
to go forward.

27:57.130 --> 27:59.185
'Cause I don't think
we can save each other.

27:59.737 --> 28:01.879
I think we each need to save ourselves now.

28:08.891 --> 28:10.917
I always thought we
might need this someday.

28:56.160 --> 28:59.443
- Good night, daddy.
- Lights out before 10:00, I mean it.

28:59.444 --> 29:00.655
Mm. All right, I love you, kiddo.

29:00.656 --> 29:01.925
- I love you, too.
- Don't stay up too late.

29:01.926 --> 29:03.171
I won't, I won't.

29:06.365 --> 29:07.267
Hey.

29:07.268 --> 29:08.076
Hey.

29:08.077 --> 29:09.874
Girls just, uh, they just went up to bed.

29:11.386 --> 29:12.617
You okay?

29:16.367 --> 29:18.882
I think we should have a conversation.

29:18.883 --> 29:22.531
I just don't think we should
be playing house anymore.

29:22.532 --> 29:24.549
Playing house, what? I mean, we're...

29:24.550 --> 29:27.191
- We're not playing house.
- Well, we kinda are.

29:27.192 --> 29:30.508
And I think it's confusing to the girls.

29:30.509 --> 29:33.002
- I think it's confusing to us.
- Yeah, but, look, you're still recovering.

29:33.003 --> 29:34.336
I mean, you can't do all this on your own.

29:34.775 --> 29:37.313
Tandy could come stay, help us out.

29:37.314 --> 29:39.321
I know...

29:39.640 --> 29:41.855
I know that we're not
getting back together.

29:43.004 --> 29:44.833
I mean, I-I don't even really want that.

29:44.834 --> 29:46.055
But...

29:47.937 --> 29:49.675
I miss our family.

29:50.171 --> 29:54.044
I really... Really miss our family.

29:54.045 --> 29:56.139
And... and I just find it
hard to believe that you don't.

29:56.140 --> 29:59.011
Oh, I do. Of course I do.

29:59.012 --> 30:00.385
I just don't want us...

30:01.674 --> 30:03.047
Spending the next six months

30:04.530 --> 30:09.252
sharing this house, being
polite to each other,

30:09.253 --> 30:11.507
not signing our divorce papers,

30:12.244 --> 30:14.867
telling ourselves we're
doing it for the girls.

30:14.868 --> 30:16.703
It seems like that would
be the easy thing to do.

30:16.704 --> 30:18.445
I just don't think it'd
be the right thing to do.

30:22.138 --> 30:24.289
I don't want our lives to be in limbo.

30:25.852 --> 30:27.553
So that's it?

30:28.605 --> 30:30.394
We can't go back.

30:42.615 --> 30:44.519
I want a number on each
one of them individually.

30:44.520 --> 30:46.005
Then the whole group together.

30:46.006 --> 30:47.635
It's a fire sale. Everything must go.

30:47.955 --> 30:49.656
- All of 'em?
- Yeah.

30:49.657 --> 30:51.768
Oh... not that one.

30:51.769 --> 30:54.587
That's a... that's a gift I gotta return.

30:55.968 --> 30:57.547
Everything else.

31:04.913 --> 31:06.134
You're a damn fool.

31:06.135 --> 31:07.815
I'm a one-handed fool.

31:08.380 --> 31:09.909
I sure as hell don't
need a bunch of guitars

31:09.910 --> 31:11.463
I'll never play again.

31:11.464 --> 31:13.510
- That ain't what the doctor said.
- Yeah, well...

31:13.511 --> 31:15.602
- You weren't listenin'.
- My ears work just fine.

31:15.603 --> 31:16.993
You wanna nag somebody all day,

31:16.994 --> 31:18.697
you need to go get
yourself a new boyfriend.

31:18.698 --> 31:20.208
All right, you wanna get mean?

31:20.801 --> 31:22.116
That's fine. I will get mean.

31:22.117 --> 31:23.436
All my life, I've watched you refuse

31:23.437 --> 31:24.939
to become the man your father was...

31:24.940 --> 31:28.319
An angry, bitter old
drunk. And look at you.

31:28.320 --> 31:31.050
Spittin' image of him, and
you are stone-cold sober.

31:31.051 --> 31:33.474
13 years of sobriety...
What was worth that?

31:33.475 --> 31:34.641
Don't you walk away from me.

31:34.642 --> 31:36.521
You tell me what 13 years of sobriety

31:36.522 --> 31:38.183
was worth throwing away for!

31:39.162 --> 31:40.885
You come up with somethin' real good.

31:42.549 --> 31:45.229
Maddie Conrad is my daughter.

31:45.230 --> 31:46.389
What?

31:46.390 --> 31:48.300
Rayna didn't want to tell
me 'cause I was a drunk,

31:48.301 --> 31:49.448
and she was right.

31:49.449 --> 31:51.511
I didn't deserve to be
a father, so I wasn't.

31:51.512 --> 31:53.973
Now I don't have Rayna,
and I don't have my music.

31:53.974 --> 31:55.188
I got nothin'.

31:56.329 --> 31:59.310
I am nothin'. So you need to let me be.

31:59.311 --> 32:00.728
Please.

32:02.430 --> 32:03.567
I heard them talking.

32:04.070 --> 32:05.523
Dad's moving back out.

32:08.561 --> 32:10.118
So much for your stupid wish

32:10.119 --> 32:12.409
that everything would go
back to the way it was.

32:12.410 --> 32:13.956
So what now?

32:13.957 --> 32:17.443
Now... it's you and me against the world.

32:26.068 --> 32:27.700
- Hey.
-  Hey.

32:28.167 --> 32:29.182
What?

32:29.183 --> 32:31.675
Oh, this whole thing with
Maddie is just a disaster.

32:32.978 --> 32:35.223
I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't
go to this party tonight.

32:35.224 --> 32:37.688
I just wanna deal with these girls.

32:37.689 --> 32:40.210
It is gonna take some time to resolve that.

32:40.211 --> 32:41.649
And you have to go.

32:41.650 --> 32:44.156
You can't let Jeff think he's
got the upper hand in this.

32:44.157 --> 32:46.652
You gotta go in there,
close that deal with Will,

32:46.653 --> 32:47.848
and be done.

32:48.418 --> 32:49.670
Come on.

32:51.812 --> 32:53.423
It's been a real crappy month.

32:53.424 --> 32:54.688
Welcome to open mic night.

32:54.689 --> 32:56.105
Here's Gunnar Scott.

33:00.678 --> 33:02.964
- Thank you, Erica.
-  Yeah!

33:02.965 --> 33:05.045
This is a new song, um,

33:05.046 --> 33:06.946
it's about...

33:07.948 --> 33:10.497
It's about the biggest
heartbreak I ever had.

33:12.222 --> 33:14.086
He told me he was having trouble writing.

33:14.848 --> 33:16.828
I guess he sorted that out.

- No, they didn't.

37:26.297 --> 37:28.305
She just finished second
on "American Hitmaker."

37:28.613 --> 37:30.813
- The reality show.
- Juliette Barnes.

37:30.814 --> 37:32.345
Wow, hi! Um,

37:32.346 --> 37:34.165
this is just so crazy
that I'm here with you.

37:34.166 --> 37:36.529
This has just all been such an insane ride.

37:36.530 --> 37:37.715
- Okay.
- I bet.

37:37.716 --> 37:39.979
From nothin' to Nashville in just 12 weeks.

37:39.980 --> 37:42.008

just, it took forever.

so, so nice to meet you.

37:46.216 --> 37:47.515
Great, girls. Why don't you go get a drink?

37:47.516 --> 37:49.512
- Uh, I'll catch up, okay.
- Bye.

37:49.834 --> 37:51.343
What, you couldn't get the winner?

37:58.016 --> 37:59.867
I was thinking about what you said earlier,

37:59.868 --> 38:01.416
and most of it is crap.

38:02.141 --> 38:03.464
You do know that, right?

38:03.772 --> 38:05.556
I mean, like the Maddie
and the Rayna thing...

38:05.557 --> 38:07.006
You... you can't do much about that.

38:07.007 --> 38:08.328
But everything about your hand,

38:08.329 --> 38:09.585
that would be on you.

38:09.586 --> 38:10.883
And you don't want to help yourself.

38:12.154 --> 38:13.443
You didn't lose a limb.

38:14.380 --> 38:16.975
Man up. Don't be a coward.

38:23.641 --> 38:25.828
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

38:26.903 --> 38:29.620
Just lost half my label,
but doesn't matter.

38:29.621 --> 38:30.891
We're gonna go out and
find somebody better.

38:30.892 --> 38:32.169
- Yeah?
- Thank you.

38:32.170 --> 38:35.066
- Thanks.
- Rayna? Hey.

38:35.067 --> 38:36.685
- Hi.
- I just wanted to say

38:36.686 --> 38:39.535
I'm sorry about how things went down.

38:39.536 --> 38:41.349
Well, you know what? It's business.

38:42.209 --> 38:43.960
And you made the choice
you had to make, so...

38:43.961 --> 38:46.139
And I really appreciated
everything you said to me,

38:46.140 --> 38:47.316
but, uh...

38:48.475 --> 38:50.052
Well, I'm not an artist.

38:51.274 --> 38:54.011
I'm just a guy who's good at
singing other people's songs.

38:54.012 --> 38:56.112
Well, I'm not sure I agree with that.

38:56.970 --> 38:58.317
