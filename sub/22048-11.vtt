00:03.120 --> 00:06.960
Why did you have to cheat
just because you thought I was?

00:07.480 --> 00:09.240
Call me when you find out who you are.

00:10.020 --> 00:11.580
It was just a hook up.

00:11.580 --> 00:15.680
It was your boyfriend who sent the tip.
-Did Isak send the tip?

00:15.680 --> 00:17.500
I think it's completely psycho.

00:17.540 --> 00:19.820
Do you have feelings for me?

00:19.820 --> 00:21.140
Like you didn't know.

00:21.140 --> 00:23.220
Will you come home with me to do homework?
-No.

00:23.220 --> 00:24.620
Let me know when you change your mind.

00:24.620 --> 00:28.080
What are you doing on your plate?
-I'm just sorting my salad.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.100
I'm not on the bus anymore.

00:32.260 --> 00:35.560
She started staggering, and then
she tripped. She's not responding.

00:38.620 --> 00:40.940
I think I killed William's baby tonight.

01:05.700 --> 01:07.600
You kept pushing me out of bed.

01:08.980 --> 01:12.140
You pulled away my covers.

01:16.220 --> 01:17.920
Your mom is never at home?

01:18.180 --> 01:23.180
She is, but she got a new job
at the Ministry of Environment so...

01:23.520 --> 01:28.420
... ever since that she's been traveling a lot more.
She's home every other week.

01:29.460 --> 01:33.800
You're alone a lot!
Isn't that cool?

01:34.980 --> 01:37.440
You can do whatever you want.

01:38.820 --> 01:41.500
Where's your dad?
-He lives in Bergen.

01:41.720 --> 01:44.860
Chris! You get to clean it up.

01:44.980 --> 01:46.880
Yeah, I'll clean it up.

01:52.560 --> 01:55.660
Dad lives in Bergen.
Mom and dad are divorced.

01:55.880 --> 01:59.680
I think we moved from Bergen when I was twelve?

01:59.680 --> 02:00.860
Do you have contact with him?

02:01.120 --> 02:07.160
No... Yeah, we have. But we kind
of lost contact when we moved.

02:07.160 --> 02:11.640
My dad got remarried,
and his wife was a bit jealous.

02:13.380 --> 02:15.140
Hi!
-Hi!

02:16.820 --> 02:17.520
Hi.

02:22.260 --> 02:25.220
We made breakfast.
-Yeah, Noora made pancakes.

02:27.300 --> 02:29.340
Let's eat.

02:32.700 --> 02:34.240
You can sit here.

02:37.620 --> 02:38.820
Take some pancakes.

02:43.220 --> 02:45.460
Just start! Sana?

02:53.640 --> 02:55.340
Do you want juice, Vilde?

02:58.380 --> 02:59.260
Here!

03:04.880 --> 03:06.900
I just spilled a bit.

03:26.140 --> 03:27.540
Do you want jam?

03:39.420 --> 03:41.460
I don't remember anything from yesterday.

03:44.820 --> 03:47.940
Nothing happened.
It was fine.

03:50.660 --> 03:57.400
Blackouts are God's way
of telling you not to worry about anything, Vilde.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.820
Nothing special happened.

04:08.480 --> 04:14.680
You just passed out
when you came to Iben's party.

04:15.120 --> 04:18.160
So we took you here.
You just slept.

04:19.680 --> 04:20.720
Vilde..

04:21.240 --> 04:24.560
Which girl with self-respect
hasn't blacked out at least once before?

04:51.160 --> 04:52.520
Thank you.

04:58.740 --> 04:59.900
I mean it.

05:06.320 --> 05:10.760
You don't have to thank us. That's
why we're on a bus together. To help each other.

05:14.300 --> 05:19.560
You still want me on your bus?
-What are you talking about? You're our bus boss!

05:25.880 --> 05:29.260
You think any of us want
to do the financials and the budget?

05:38.520 --> 05:42.100
But eh... I can be a
bit stressed as the bus boss.

05:44.180 --> 05:48.160
If it interferes with other things.
That could easily happen.

05:57.300 --> 05:59.060
Yeah, like what?

05:59.280 --> 06:02.380
Well, like school and...

06:03.960 --> 06:06.520
Things like fun stuff outside of school.

06:10.700 --> 06:12.160
Or, eh...

06:14.980 --> 06:16.340
A child.

06:26.840 --> 06:29.260
Vilde, are you pregnant?

06:34.900 --> 06:37.440
Are you sure?
-Yes.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.280
How sure?

07:17.080 --> 07:19.280
Yeah... yeah, yeah.

07:22.120 --> 07:27.620
It'll probably be another
little trip to doctor Skrulle.

07:34.620 --> 07:38.180
It's quite catchy.
-Who are you talking about?

07:38.560 --> 07:39.920
Justin...

07:40.560 --> 07:41.800
Your crush.

07:41.800 --> 07:44.940
Eva, that's between us.
-Look, look!

07:46.280 --> 07:50.020
Yeah, yeah.
I saw that.

07:51.600 --> 07:52.660
Hi!

07:54.560 --> 07:55.320
Hi.

07:55.660 --> 08:00.020
The theater group invites you to the Christmas
tree lighting on Friday. Are you coming?

08:01.320 --> 08:02.760
Maybe?

08:02.860 --> 08:05.880
You have to.
The entire school will be there.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.540
Okay, we're coming.
-Great!

08:15.880 --> 08:19.060
Yeah, yeah. I've seen it.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.540
Hi beautiful.

08:22.120 --> 08:24.860
Willhelm! Wow.

08:26.040 --> 08:27.880
You're not answering my messages?

08:28.500 --> 08:29.620
No power.

08:30.920 --> 08:32.320
For two weeks straight.

08:36.620 --> 08:38.540
Should we skip the next class?

08:39.920 --> 08:42.840
You have to give up now.
-Give up?

08:44.060 --> 08:45.580
I won't give up.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.680
You're wasting your time.

08:51.800 --> 08:54.100
Listen, Noora Amalie Sætre.

08:54.920 --> 08:58.480
You're a smart girl. You have
to understand that every time you reject me...

09:00.280 --> 09:02.020
...I only want you more and more.

09:04.260 --> 09:06.980
So if you really want to
get rid of me, just go on a date with me.

09:10.460 --> 09:12.360
Stop playing hard to get.

09:14.640 --> 09:15.960
Great logic.

09:21.560 --> 09:22.920
Was that all, or?

09:25.680 --> 09:26.980
No, one more thing.

09:31.900 --> 09:33.780
Fucking hell, you're so beautiful.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.300
Just tell me what I should do!

09:56.000 --> 09:57.320
Hi...
-Hi.

09:58.760 --> 10:02.000
Maybe we should talk.

10:02.400 --> 10:03.520
Yes.

10:04.260 --> 10:06.120
When can you talk?

10:07.760 --> 10:12.400
I have lots to do this week.

10:14.100 --> 10:17.060
But, Thursday maybe?

10:17.060 --> 10:18.220
Thursday is fine.

10:21.580 --> 10:23.460
What's up with him?

10:24.360 --> 10:26.880
He's in love with me.
-You're kidding!

10:34.620 --> 10:35.900
Hi there!

10:39.820 --> 10:42.480
Oh, she's new. Salaam alaikum?

10:53.300 --> 10:57.360
Vilde is pregnant!
-Ai, that went fast.

10:59.100 --> 11:01.700
Vilde Lien, what should
I say? Congratulations?

11:01.700 --> 11:04.580
She's not gonna keep the child!
-That's completely up to her.

11:04.720 --> 11:08.320
She's 16! She's
still a child herself.

11:08.320 --> 11:14.640
World's youngest mother
was 5 years old when she gave birth.

11:15.040 --> 11:20.000
But she wasn't from Norway.
She was from some place in South America.

11:20.220 --> 11:23.520
I want to say Chile.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.960
Or was it Peru?

11:26.900 --> 11:30.000
Yeah, hello?
-Hi. Yeah.

11:31.660 --> 11:32.660
What should we do?

11:32.660 --> 11:39.080
Yeah, what should we do?
I think the first thing we should do is a blood test.

11:39.320 --> 11:40.580
I took a test.

11:41.380 --> 11:44.540
When did you take the test?
-I took it on Friday.

11:45.480 --> 11:49.120
On Friday? And have
you had sex since Friday?

11:49.220 --> 11:51.660
No!
-Are you really sure?

11:51.920 --> 11:54.820
There were a few hours
where it went a bit black..

11:56.340 --> 12:01.700
Okay, girls. This here
is an ovulation test.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.120
An ovulation test?

12:05.400 --> 12:14.220
It will tell you the likelihood of you
getting pregnant after taking the test.

12:14.440 --> 12:15.340
Seriously?

12:19.240 --> 12:23.900
But there's more.
I feel sick in the morning.

12:24.440 --> 12:27.660
I have a bloated stomach.
It's gotten a lot bigger.

12:28.220 --> 12:31.040
I hasn't gotten that
much bigger. Can I take a look?

12:34.860 --> 12:36.320
Does this hurt?

12:36.580 --> 12:37.120
Yes.

12:40.180 --> 12:42.780
How's your diet?
-Good.

12:44.820 --> 12:46.200
What did you eat today?

12:46.420 --> 12:52.480
It's still really early,
so a Cola Light and gum.

12:53.180 --> 12:55.200
Yeah, got it.

12:57.360 --> 13:04.520
Then I don't think there's a baby in your stomach.
There's probably air in your intestines.

13:06.260 --> 13:12.440
That happens when you cram Cola Light and gum into your
stomach. It just produces more gas. Do you eat a lot?

13:13.540 --> 13:14.900
No.
-No?

13:14.900 --> 13:24.960
You should. You're pushing up too much air in your intestines.
Then you get a stomach ache. You have to fart it out.

13:25.760 --> 13:30.280
In the worst case scenario we have to
give you a colostomy. It's like a poop bag on your stomach.

13:31.760 --> 13:35.080
Are you serious?
-No, of course not.

13:35.480 --> 13:41.300
But you can't live on Cola
and gum. That's the point I'm trying to make.

13:57.440 --> 14:00.160
Yes! We will not be having a baby!

14:10.420 --> 14:11.680
Vilde...

14:12.100 --> 14:13.820
I see what you're doing.

14:15.380 --> 14:16.860
And you have to stop.

14:21.900 --> 14:24.060
You don't know what you're talking about.

14:24.400 --> 14:27.540
Yes, I do know.

14:29.320 --> 14:35.880
You stuff yourself with chocolate milk and
pancakes and you look like a super model.

14:36.280 --> 14:38.140
What are you talking about?

14:38.940 --> 14:41.440
You look like a super model.

14:43.700 --> 14:47.520
Vilde, you're super pretty.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.000
But not good enough.

15:09.180 --> 15:10.220
Isak...

15:12.020 --> 15:13.880
Be completely honest with me now.

15:14.580 --> 15:15.300
Yes.

15:16.800 --> 15:22.620
If I don't believe you, I'll ask
Jonas. Then I'll tell him why I'm asking.

15:23.900 --> 15:24.780
I understand.

15:28.500 --> 15:35.040
When we were at the cabin, and
I asked you if you knew if Jonas and Ingrid texted..

15:39.720 --> 15:44.100
I knew he texted with
her because of her brother.

15:45.380 --> 15:46.580
So it wasn't about French?

15:47.440 --> 15:50.960
No. Well, maybe that too.

15:51.340 --> 15:56.260
Jonas stressed like crazy about
bringing that shit on the cabin trip.

15:56.460 --> 16:01.820
He couldn't reach her brother,
so instead he sent her a message.

16:07.060 --> 16:08.760
You guys smoked at the cabin?

16:10.880 --> 16:15.580
Yeah, that's why Elias came.
Jonas didn't get anything before we left.

16:18.420 --> 16:24.700
I won't criticize you, but we were
pretty out of it. I'm surprised you didn't notice it.

16:28.580 --> 16:29.520
Okay.

16:31.820 --> 16:33.160
Anyway.

16:33.460 --> 16:37.640
What about the other time?
When I thought I heard Ingrid's voice on the phone.

16:37.940 --> 16:40.980
When I asked you,
did you know anything?

16:41.740 --> 16:42.640
No.

16:48.300 --> 16:53.740
I could've known it was
because of her brother.

16:54.800 --> 17:01.920
But I promised Jonas I wouldn't
tell you anything about him smoking.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.780
So I kept my promise.

17:05.240 --> 17:07.200
But you advised me to ask Ingrid?

17:10.480 --> 17:15.160
That was bad advice. Plain bad advice.

17:16.280 --> 17:22.040
I should've just told you
that you shouldn't worry about her.

17:22.760 --> 17:27.180
He was more in love with you than... ever.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.880
It would've been really cool
if you could've told me this a bit earlier.

17:39.360 --> 17:43.520
One more thing. If you wanted to
fuck things up between me and Jonas...

17:43.820 --> 17:46.400
Then why didn't you advise
me to tell Jonas about Chris?

17:49.980 --> 17:53.680
I knew that if you told Jonas
yourself he would have forgiven you.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.920
Do you understand how
messed up that sounds to me?

18:04.320 --> 18:06.700
I feel like I don't know you anymore.

18:15.940 --> 18:22.820
I know it might be hard to believe,
but I never wanted to hurt you. It just turned out that way.

18:31.000 --> 18:31.980
I'm sorry.

18:50.360 --> 18:51.740
Karma's a bitch.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.520
If nothing else...

18:58.660 --> 19:01.220
At least now I know
how Ingrid must've felt.

19:59.420 --> 20:01.840
Hi!
-Hi!

20:04.560 --> 20:07.000
How are you doing?
-I'm fine.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.380
What are you doing?

20:10.700 --> 20:12.220
Just Christmas shopping.

20:12.760 --> 20:14.560
You don't like Christmas shopping.

20:17.480 --> 20:18.560
Who was that?

20:19.780 --> 20:20.900
My sister.

20:22.540 --> 20:23.560
Okay...

20:25.640 --> 20:26.920
I swear!

20:28.720 --> 20:30.000
Okay, I believe you.

20:31.060 --> 20:31.840
Good.

20:33.560 --> 20:36.460
But...
-Yeah?

20:37.760 --> 20:41.680
You told me to call
when I found out who I am.

20:41.960 --> 20:42.740
Yes.

20:45.380 --> 20:46.740
Do you want to meet?

20:47.540 --> 20:49.180
Yes, of course. When?

20:50.720 --> 20:54.760
Now you're probably going to
smoke marijuana with Ingrid's brother.

20:54.760 --> 20:57.860
That's not true.
-Come in the morning.

20:59.280 --> 21:00.740
Yeah, tomorrow suits me.

21:02.140 --> 21:02.980
Good.

21:05.820 --> 21:08.680
We'll talk then. Bye.

21:39.040 --> 21:40.860
Hi.
-Hi.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.760
Tea?
-Yeah.

22:01.540 --> 22:02.660
That was warm.

22:17.880 --> 22:22.200
Do you remember the first time we kissed?

22:24.280 --> 22:27.740
Why are you laughing?
-Of course I remember that.

22:28.460 --> 22:30.300
Yeah? What do you remember?

22:31.380 --> 22:32.900
What do I remember?

22:35.400 --> 22:36.160
Yeah.

22:36.440 --> 22:39.160
What is it?
-It's a bit weird.

22:39.380 --> 22:40.940
No. Say it.

22:46.560 --> 22:50.700
The thing is that I didn't
know you felt the same thing I did.

22:51.800 --> 22:56.760
Since you were best friends with
my girl, it was a big risk to take.

22:56.960 --> 23:02.180
If it didn't go well,
it would have been really weird.

23:02.720 --> 23:06.080
So I just waited for a sign.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.960
What kind of sign?

23:12.240 --> 23:14.220
A sign that I should kiss you.

23:19.900 --> 23:23.420
And you know the Take Me to Church
song they played all the time?

23:23.600 --> 23:24.420
Yes.

23:24.960 --> 23:30.660
I kept thinking if that was
the next song that came on, I should go fot it.

23:31.240 --> 23:32.340
So did it come on?

23:32.760 --> 23:35.060
No, it didn't.

23:36.180 --> 23:39.160
They played this Kygo shit...

23:41.200 --> 23:43.660
But then it was you who kissed me.

23:47.520 --> 23:48.920
It was me who kissed you.

23:52.160 --> 23:55.480
What you didn't know,
was that I thought the exact same thing as you.

23:55.480 --> 23:56.400
Oh yeah?

23:56.640 --> 23:59.460
I need to have a sign.

24:00.360 --> 24:05.260
If the next song was Kygo,
I would kiss you.

24:05.400 --> 24:06.480
So funny.

24:09.180 --> 24:12.520
But that was not why you kissed me, was it?

24:12.840 --> 24:13.660
No.

24:15.160 --> 24:16.320
That wasn't why.

24:22.900 --> 24:25.140
I kissed you because
I couldn't help myself.

24:28.340 --> 24:32.760
It wasn't like I was with
you just because it seemed cool.

24:33.640 --> 24:34.640
No?

24:36.560 --> 24:37.340
No.

24:40.940 --> 24:45.400
You accusing me of that,
actually angered me a little.

24:47.180 --> 24:51.880
It felt like I had to
give up everything to be with you.

24:53.800 --> 24:56.220
I ditched my best friends.

25:00.340 --> 25:05.340
So when you said
I just do what others think is cool...

25:05.560 --> 25:10.000
... and that I don't have my
own opinion, it's really unfair.

25:15.240 --> 25:16.420
Because it's not true.

25:21.080 --> 25:22.440
Because I chose you.

25:27.020 --> 25:30.220
And it was a really stupid choice.

25:31.440 --> 25:33.580
But at least I didn't
do it to be popular.

25:38.400 --> 25:39.780
A really stupid choice?

25:41.080 --> 25:41.860
Yes.

25:43.600 --> 25:44.760
A really stupid choice.

25:48.340 --> 25:50.540
Because it made me feel like shit.

25:52.780 --> 25:57.780
I walked around paranoid all the time
because I thought there might be something betwen you two.

25:59.100 --> 26:04.280
I thought that if you and
I could do something like that to Ingrid...

26:05.920 --> 26:08.100
... you could do the same thing to me.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.000
You understand?

26:24.700 --> 26:29.540
Maybe I thought I deserved it.

26:31.360 --> 26:36.560
And so I became insecure and desperate.

26:37.920 --> 26:40.420
Your opinion meant more than my own.

26:46.660 --> 26:48.320
That's not how it should be.

26:49.680 --> 26:50.540
No.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.560
I have to find out...

27:00.940 --> 27:02.940
... what my own opinion is.

27:09.440 --> 27:10.520
And I have to do it on my own.

28:35.360 --> 28:36.820
Do we break up now?

28:42.900 --> 28:44.060
I think so.

28:50.640 --> 28:51.960
Is that what you want?

28:57.640 --> 28:58.560
Yes.

29:11.520 --> 29:13.000
Right now...

29:15.980 --> 29:18.540
... this seems like the most important thing.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.780
As if nothing else has meaning.

29:35.780 --> 29:37.320
Then we'll just lie here for now.

31:03.440 --> 31:05.260
Hello.
-Hi.

31:08.180 --> 31:10.080
Me and Jonas broke up.

31:16.560 --> 31:18.480
I just thought I should tell you.

31:21.540 --> 31:22.560
Are you okay?

31:23.660 --> 31:24.600
Hi!

31:24.920 --> 31:25.800
Hi!

31:26.900 --> 31:28.380
Have you seen Vilde?

31:28.820 --> 31:30.040
Eh, no.

31:30.260 --> 31:32.420
But she should be coming, right?

31:32.820 --> 31:34.060
Yeah, I think so.

31:34.680 --> 31:36.720
Okay, can I just borrow your phone?

31:36.780 --> 31:38.000
Yes.

31:43.220 --> 31:44.520
My battery's empty.

31:46.200 --> 31:51.860
In 2015? Is there no one
who has functioning technology?

31:54.540 --> 31:55.340
Thanks.

32:03.300 --> 32:04.960
Do you have Vilde's number?

32:05.040 --> 32:06.400
No, I don't.

32:08.740 --> 32:11.080
Hi!
-Hi!

32:11.200 --> 32:13.700
I just want to say Merry Christmas.

32:14.180 --> 32:16.220
Yes, Merry Christmas!

32:19.900 --> 32:20.880
Vilde!

32:21.240 --> 32:22.080
Hi!

32:23.740 --> 32:27.120
Noora is looking for you like crazy.
-Why?

32:27.120 --> 32:30.040
I'm sure she's scared
you've blacked out somewhere.

32:30.500 --> 32:32.020
Really funny!

32:32.360 --> 32:33.600
Vilde?

32:35.680 --> 32:37.420
Hey.
-Hi.

32:37.820 --> 32:39.920
Remember when I said you weren't good enough?

32:42.300 --> 32:43.620
That was bullshit.

32:45.720 --> 32:47.180
You're more than good enough.

32:47.700 --> 32:53.820
Anyone who says otherwise, is an asshole.
Including me. Okay?

32:54.620 --> 32:55.600
Okay.

33:02.380 --> 33:04.300
What just happened?

33:06.540 --> 33:08.720
I have to tell Chris and Sana!

33:25.300 --> 33:26.460
Hey you.

33:26.460 --> 33:29.420
I found Vilde. You're never going
to guess what just happened.

33:29.460 --> 33:36.620
I just thought of something. Remember
when you told me it was a little weird...

33:36.620 --> 33:40.720
... when Isak said he has feelings for you.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.160
Eh, yes.

33:44.360 --> 33:45.760
Because...

33:47.220 --> 33:54.600
I just think that maybe it's
not you he has feelings for.
