{\an8}- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

25:15.931 --> 25:18.016
{\an8}SO WE END UP TELLING
THE GIRLS UPSTAIRS

25:18.099 --> 25:19.476
{\an8}THAT, "OUR ROOMMATES
ARE BITCHING.

25:19.559 --> 25:21.269
{\an8}THEY'RE DOWNSTAIRS RIGHT NOW.
YOU GUYS HAVE TO LEAVE."

25:21.353 --> 25:22.270
{\an8}AND THEY'RE LIKE,
"ALL RIGHT, NO PROBLEM.

25:22.354 --> 25:23.355
{\an8}WE WERE GONNA LEAVE ANYWAY."

25:23.438 --> 25:25.273
{\an8}WALKED THOSE
TWO GIRLS DOWNSTAIRS.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.816
{\an8}WE WERE WALKING
RIGHT BY THE OTHER GIRLS.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.652
{\an8}LIKE, "OH, THOSE ARE
OUR ROOMMATES," WHATEVER.

25:28.735 --> 25:30.987
{\an8}- BITCHES. HI, BITCHES.
- HOW DO YOU LIVE WITH THEM?

25:31.071 --> 25:32.447
{\an8}- THEY WERE NICE.
I WILL GIVE THEM THAT.

25:32.530 --> 25:34.407
{\an8}BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
I JUST WANTED TO FOOL AROUND.

25:34.491 --> 25:35.659
{\an8}- BYE.
- BYE.

25:35.742 --> 25:37.077
{\an8}IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU.
- WAIT, WAIT. HOLD UP, HOLD UP.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.119
{\an8}DO HAVE, LIKE,
A PEN OR ANYTHING?

25:38.203 --> 25:38.870
{\an8}OR DO YOU HAVE A PEN?

25:38.954 --> 25:39.704
{\an8}MAYBE I MIGHT HAVE TO GIVE HER

25:39.788 --> 25:41.831
{\an8}A LITTLE ATTENTION
IN THE FUTURE,

25:41.915 --> 25:43.083
{\an8}BUT I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE NOT.

25:43.166 --> 25:45.168
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, BYE.
- IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU.

25:45.252 --> 25:47.128
{\an8}- LET'S TAKE CARE
OF THESE ROOMMATES, BRO.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.965
{\an8}- YEAH, I WOULD TAKE CARE
OF THEM TOO IF I WAS YOU.

25:50.048 --> 25:50.924
{\an8}- AND THEN WE TAKE
THE TWO OTHER GIRLS

25:51.007 --> 25:52.634
{\an8}THAT WE ORIGINALLY
WERE GONNA TAKE HOME.

25:52.717 --> 25:53.927
{\an8}WE TAKE THEM UPSTAIRS,

25:54.010 --> 25:55.845
{\an8}AND WE START HANGING AROUND
WITH THEM CHICKS.

25:55.929 --> 25:58.390
{\an8}- UM, THIS IS NOT HOT.

25:58.473 --> 26:00.642
{\an8}- IT IS WARMING UP
RIGHT NOW, SO...

26:00.725 --> 26:01.643
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, WE'LL WAIT.

26:01.726 --> 26:02.519
{\an8}- YEAH.
- JUST CHILL, RIGHT?

26:02.602 --> 26:05.105
{\an8}- IT'S FINE.
CAN I GO TO THE BATHROOM?

26:05.188 --> 26:05.981
{\an8}SHOW US THE HOUSE.

26:06.064 --> 26:07.983
{\an8}- YEAH, PAULY,
YOU WANT TO TAKE HER

26:08.066 --> 26:09.234
{\an8}AND SHOW HER THE BATHROOM
REAL QUICK?

26:09.317 --> 26:12.445
{\an8}THIS IS HOPEFULLY WARMING UP.

26:12.529 --> 26:13.989
{\an8}BASICALLY, ONE OF THESE GIRLS

26:14.072 --> 26:16.449
{\an8}WAS DEFINITELY MORE CUTER
THAN THE OTHER,

26:16.533 --> 26:18.827
{\an8}AND IT HAPPENED TO BE MY GIRL.

26:18.910 --> 26:21.121
{\an8}AND PAULY D
WAS WITH THE GRENADE.

26:21.204 --> 26:23.999
{\an8}[explosion]

26:24.082 --> 26:27.794
{\an8}[laughing]

26:27.877 --> 26:29.879
{\an8}ALL RIGHT,
LET ME GET BACK TO IT.

26:29.963 --> 26:32.215
{\an8}SO--[laughing]

26:32.299 --> 26:33.758
{\an8}THAT'S [bleep] FUNNY.

26:33.842 --> 26:37.220
{\an8}UH, WHEN YOU GO INTO BATTLE,
YOU NEED TO HAVE

26:37.304 --> 26:38.346
{\an8}SOME FRIENDS WITH YOU

26:38.430 --> 26:40.682
{\an8}SO THAT JUST IN CASE A GRENADE
GETS THROWN AT YOU,

26:40.765 --> 26:42.434
{\an8}YOU KNOW, ONE OF YOUR BUDDIES
TAKES IT FIRST.

26:42.517 --> 26:45.020
{\an8}- I REALLY LIKE ALEX
A LITTLE BIT.

26:45.103 --> 26:46.313
{\an8}ALEX IS, LIKE, MY TYPE.

26:46.396 --> 26:49.232
{\an8}- YOU DID LIKE HER UNTIL THESE
[bleep] ROLLED UP IN A MERCEDES.

26:49.316 --> 26:50.525
{\an8}- I KNOW, RIGHT?

26:50.608 --> 26:52.193
{\an8}LIKE, I'M SORRY
I DON'T DRIVE A MERCEDES.

26:52.277 --> 26:53.111
{\an8}- NO, BUT ALEX IS SO MY TYPE.

26:53.194 --> 26:55.780
{\an8}SHE'S, LIKE, DARK HAIR--
I LIKE DARK HAIR.

26:55.864 --> 26:57.240
{\an8}- HE DOES LIKE DARK HAIR.

26:57.324 --> 26:59.451
{\an8}- WOMEN ARE DEFINITELY A GAME.
IT'S LIKE A BUSINESS.

26:59.534 --> 27:01.286
{\an8}LIKE, YOU GOT--
THERE'S RULES TO IT.

27:01.369 --> 27:02.454
{\an8}AND, LIKE,
BOYS TAKE CARE OF BOYS,

27:02.537 --> 27:04.998
{\an8}SO THAT'S WHY I WAS WILLING
TO TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM,

27:05.081 --> 27:06.499
{\an8}JUST SO MY BOY COULD GET SOME.

27:06.583 --> 27:06.958
{\an8}AND SITUATION
WOULD DO THE SAME FOR ME.

27:07.042 --> 27:09.627
{\an8}- I NEED A SHOT.

27:09.711 --> 27:11.046
{\an8}WANT TO GET ME ONE?

27:11.129 --> 27:12.213
{\an8}- MY GIRL WAS [bleep] BUSTED.

27:12.297 --> 27:15.175
{\an8}SO I'M, LIKE--I'M JUST TRYING
TO GO WITH THE FLOW.

27:15.258 --> 27:16.426
{\an8}AND MIKE'S, LIKE, TALKING
WITH HIS CHICK.

27:16.509 --> 27:18.845
{\an8}AND I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP
MY GIRL ENTERTAINED OR WHATEVER.

27:18.928 --> 27:20.305
{\an8}- DO YOU WANT TO GO UPSTAIRS?

27:20.388 --> 27:23.058
{\an8}- SURE, LIKE, I THINK
ALL OF US SHOULD, LIKE--

27:23.141 --> 27:24.976
{\an8}- ME AND ALEX
ARE TAKING A NAP UPSTAIRS.

27:25.060 --> 27:26.353
{\an8}[laughs]

27:26.436 --> 27:29.147
{\an8}- I WOULD SO DO YOUR DISHES,

27:29.230 --> 27:31.983
{\an8}BUT I'M NOT EVEN TRYING
TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.610
{\an8}IT'S BOTHERING ME, THOUGH.

27:33.693 --> 27:35.737
{\an8}- REALLY?
- I MIGHT HAVE TO GO SOON.

27:35.820 --> 27:36.738
{\an8}- SO THIS BLOND CHICK--
SHE'S NOT EVEN HOT,

27:36.821 --> 27:39.157
{\an8}AND SHE'S COMPLAINING
THAT SHE HAS TO BE HOME.

27:39.240 --> 27:40.116
{\an8}SHE HAS WORK
OR WHATEVER IT IS.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.826
{\an8}SHE HAS SOMETHING TO DO
IN THE MORNING.

27:41.910 --> 27:42.410
{\an8}AND I'M LIKE--
IN MY HEAD, I'M LIKE,

27:42.494 --> 27:43.578
{\an8}"WELL, THEN GO HOME."

27:43.661 --> 27:45.914
{\an8}LIKE, I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO DEAL
WITH IT ANYMORE.

27:45.997 --> 27:47.248
{\an8}- SO MAYBE IF WE TAKE, LIKE,
A TWO-HOUR NAP,

27:47.332 --> 27:48.500
{\an8}WE SHOULD BE STRAIGHT?

27:48.583 --> 27:50.794
{\an8}- WE DON'T NEED A NAP
RIGHT NOW.

27:50.877 --> 27:52.379
{\an8}- THAT'S HYPOTHETICALLY.

27:52.462 --> 27:54.714
{\an8}- I JUST WANT TO GO FEEL
IF THAT HOT TUB WARMED UP.

27:54.798 --> 27:57.050
{\an8}- SHE WAS ANNOYING.
I COULDN'T STAND HER.

27:57.133 --> 27:58.093
{\an8}- CAN I HAVE A GLASS OF WATER?

27:58.176 --> 28:00.053
{\an8}- SURE.

28:00.136 --> 28:04.015
{\an8}I HAVE A CERTAIN POINT THAT
IF [bleep] ARE PISSING ME OFF,

28:04.099 --> 28:06.226
{\an8}LIKE, I JUST--I'LL JUST LEAVE.
LIKE, I CAN'T.

28:06.309 --> 28:07.644
{\an8}I WAS ENTERTAINING THAT GIRL

28:07.727 --> 28:09.729
{\an8}ONLY 'CAUSE I WAS TAKING ONE
FOR THE TEAM FOR MIKE.

28:09.813 --> 28:10.522
{\an8}BUT SHE STARTS TALKING STUPID,
AND THEY WANT TO LEAVE,

28:10.605 --> 28:12.607
{\an8}AND IT'S, LIKE,
A WASTE OF TIME.

28:12.690 --> 28:14.776
{\an8}I'M NOT ABOUT TO WASTE MY TIME.
I WAS TIRED.

28:14.859 --> 28:16.027
{\an8}I TURNED RIGHT AROUND AND LET
MIKE DEAL WITH THEM TWO CHICKS.

28:16.111 --> 28:19.322
{\an8}THEY WERE HIS CHICKS, ANYWAY,
SO LET HIM DEAL WITH THEM.

28:19.406 --> 28:21.950
{\an8}- PAULY IMMEDIATELY FLEED
THE SCENE.

28:22.033 --> 28:24.035
{\an8}AND LEFT ME IN ARM'S WAY.

28:24.119 --> 28:25.453
{\an8}- WHERE'S YOUR FRIEND?

28:25.537 --> 28:28.873
{\an8}- NO, IT'S WARMING ONE DEGREE
EVERY TWO HOURS.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.208
{\an8}- I WAS TAKING HEAVY FIRE,

28:30.291 --> 28:31.793
{\an8}AND I DIDN'T WEAR
MY BULLETPROOF VEST.

28:31.876 --> 28:34.629
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S PROBABLY
WARM, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

28:34.712 --> 28:37.799
{\an8}- IT'S NOT WARM,
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

28:37.882 --> 28:40.468
{\an8}- AND I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF I'M GONNA MAKE IT.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.762
{\an8}- THIS IS A SICK HOT TUB,
IF IT WAS HOT.

28:42.846 --> 28:43.847
{\an8}THIS IS A SICK TUB.

28:43.930 --> 28:45.890
{\an8}- I MEAN, WE HAVE PROBABLY
TEN MINUTES

28:45.974 --> 28:47.058
{\an8}FOR IT TO WARM UP.

28:47.142 --> 28:48.268
{\an8}AND IT'S GONNA GET WARMER.

28:48.351 --> 28:50.186
{\an8}- CAN I GET A LIGHTER, MIKE?

28:51.980 --> 28:55.859
{\an8}SO I DECIDE TO JUST FLEE
THE SCENE WITH MY GIRL.

28:55.942 --> 28:57.235
{\an8}ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET YOU A LIGHTER.

28:57.318 --> 28:59.195
{\an8}COME ON.
- NO, I GOT ONE.

28:59.279 --> 29:02.157
{\an8}- CAN I GO IN HERE?
LET'S GO IN YOUR ROOM.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.324
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.083
{\an8}WE WERE UPSTAIRS,
AND WE'RE HAVING FUN.

29:12.167 --> 29:12.792
{\an8}WE'RE HOOKING UP.

29:12.876 --> 29:15.003
{\an8}AND WE GET UNDER THE COVERS.

29:15.086 --> 29:15.670
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA GO DOWN,

29:15.753 --> 29:17.547
{\an8}BUT WE'RE UNDER THE COVERS.

29:22.552 --> 29:23.595
{\an8}- ALEX?

29:23.678 --> 29:24.846
{\an8}ALEX?
- WHAT?

29:24.929 --> 29:27.223
{\an8}- I'M LEAVING.
- ALL RIGHT, DUDE, I, LIKE--

29:27.307 --> 29:29.225
{\an8}- YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS, SO...

29:29.309 --> 29:30.101
{\an8}- AND THEN I HEAR
HER GIRLFRIEND,

29:30.185 --> 29:32.604
{\an8}LIKE, LIKE, STANDING
OVER ME, LIKE,

29:32.687 --> 29:34.856
{\an8}"WHAT ARE YOU DOING
UNDER THE COV--"

29:34.939 --> 29:36.441
{\an8}I WAS JUST LIKE, "OH, WOW."

29:36.524 --> 29:38.193
{\an8}I'M LIKE,
"WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW?"

29:38.276 --> 29:39.986
{\an8}CALM DOWN, SWEETHEART.
- ME?

29:40.069 --> 29:42.030
{\an8}- STOP HATING ON ME
AND YOUR GIRL RIGHT NOW,

29:42.113 --> 29:43.281
{\an8}'CAUSE I LIKE YOUR GIRL.
- ME?

29:43.364 --> 29:44.574
{\an8}- YEAH, JUST--JUST--

29:44.657 --> 29:47.368
{\an8}PAULY, YOU WANT TO, LIKE, WALK
THIS GIRL DOWNSTAIRS REAL QUICK?

29:47.452 --> 29:48.536
{\an8}- I DON'T GIVE A [bleep].

29:48.620 --> 29:51.748
{\an8}I'LL ENTERTAIN THE CHICK
SO MY BOY CAN GET SOME ASS,

29:51.831 --> 29:53.500
{\an8}AND THEN ONCE IT GETS
TO A CERTAIN POINT,

29:53.583 --> 29:55.710
{\an8}IF IT'S TAKING TOO LONG--
LIKE, SITUATION TOOK FOREVER.

29:55.793 --> 29:56.753
{\an8}LIKE, IT SHOULD BE
STRICTLY BUSINESS--

29:56.836 --> 29:59.422
{\an8}JACUZZI, BEDROOM,
TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS,

29:59.506 --> 30:01.633
{\an8}AND THEN I GOT TO GO TO BED.

30:01.716 --> 30:03.885
{\an8}- NICE MEETING YOU, PAULY.
- YOU TOO.

30:03.968 --> 30:05.678
{\an8}- THAT GIRL WAS--
WAS, LIKE, A--

30:05.762 --> 30:07.013
{\an8}SHE WAS A BOMB PRETTY MUCH,

30:07.096 --> 30:08.640
{\an8}AND PAULY DID NOT KNOW THE CODE
TO DECIPHER THE BOMB.

30:08.723 --> 30:11.059
{\an8}THAT'S--YOU KNOW,
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH

30:11.142 --> 30:13.019
{\an8}REALLY WHAT HAPPENED
RIGHT THERE.

30:14.646 --> 30:15.897
{\an8}MMM.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.440
{\an8}- YOU BETTER CALL ME.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA CALL ME.

30:17.524 --> 30:19.150
{\an8}- I WILL, I WILL, I WILL.
- I HOPE YOU CALL ME.

30:19.234 --> 30:20.777
{\an8}- I WILL.

30:20.860 --> 30:22.237
{\an8}- BYE.

30:41.256 --> 30:42.340
{\an8}- RON REALLY MADE THAT NIGHT.

30:42.423 --> 30:44.884
{\an8}WE JUST HUNG OUT ALL NIGHT,
AND WE HAD A GOOD TIME.

30:44.968 --> 30:46.010
{\an8}HE MADE ME LAUGH.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.428
{\an8}SO I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,

30:47.512 --> 30:49.097
{\an8}SOMETHING
WAS GONNA HAPPEN THERE,

30:49.180 --> 30:50.306
{\an8}BUT OBVIOUSLY, IT DIDN'T,

30:50.390 --> 30:53.601
{\an8}AND I, ONCE AGAIN,
WASTED MY TIME.

30:57.021 --> 30:59.148
{\an8}- MY BOY TOLD ME YOU WERE
DANCING WITH PAULY ALL NIGHT.

30:59.232 --> 31:00.108
{\an8}- WE WERE ALL DANCING
WITH EVERYBODY, THOUGH.

31:00.191 --> 31:01.317
{\an8}- YEAH.
- LIKE, IT WASN'T, LIKE, SEXUAL.

31:01.401 --> 31:04.445
{\an8}SHE JUST LEFT.

31:04.529 --> 31:05.947
{\an8}EWW!

31:06.030 --> 31:08.575
{\an8}OH, MY GOD,
I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO CRY.

31:15.206 --> 31:20.878
[duck phone quacking]

31:20.962 --> 31:22.088
- HELLO.

31:22.171 --> 31:23.798
- HI.
- HI.

31:23.881 --> 31:24.716
- SO I TALKED TO MY BOY,
AND HE TOLD ME

31:24.799 --> 31:27.510
YOU WERE DANCING
WITH PAULY ALL NIGHT.

31:27.594 --> 31:29.012
- I WAS WHAT?

31:29.095 --> 31:30.597
- DANCING WITH PAULY
ALL NIGHT.

31:30.680 --> 31:34.100
{\an8}- THE BOY THAT SNICKERS TRIED
TO GO HOME WITH, RUSS,

31:34.183 --> 31:35.810
{\an8}IS FRIENDS WITH TOMMY.

31:35.893 --> 31:37.937
{\an8}SO TOM ASKED HIM TO KEEP
AN EYE ON ME.

31:38.021 --> 31:39.856
{\an8}AND, OF COURSE,
HIS DOUCHE BAG FRIEND

31:39.939 --> 31:42.817
{\an8}SAID ME AND PAULY
WERE BUMPING AND GRINDING.

31:42.900 --> 31:44.193
{\an8}I WAS NOT!

31:44.277 --> 31:46.654
{\an8}- HE SAID THE TOOL BAG
WITH THE BLOWOUT.

31:46.738 --> 31:51.576
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW WHO THE [bleep]
ELSE THAT COULD BE.

31:51.659 --> 31:53.745
{\an8}- FOR LIKE FIVE MINUTES,
NOT EVEN.

31:53.828 --> 31:55.121
{\an8}- SWEAR TO GOD...
- WHAT?

31:55.204 --> 31:56.914
{\an8}- I SWEAR TO GOD, IF YOU'RE
FLIRTING WITH THIS KID,

31:56.998 --> 31:57.749
{\an8}I'M DONE, I SWEAR TO GOD.

31:57.832 --> 32:00.293
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT,
THEN I'M HANGING UP.

32:00.376 --> 32:04.172
{\an8}[dial tone]

32:04.255 --> 32:06.591
{\an8}I DON'T NECESSARY KNOW
IF TOMMY, LIKE,

32:06.674 --> 32:08.468
{\an8}HE DIRECTLY SAID,
"KEEP AN EYE ON HER."

32:08.551 --> 32:11.971
{\an8}OR HIS BOY WAS LIKE,
"TOM, I'LL KEEP AN EYE ON HER."

32:12.055 --> 32:13.973
{\an8}BUT WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE,
HE HIT HIM UP

32:14.057 --> 32:15.600
{\an8}ASKING WHAT I DID.

32:15.683 --> 32:18.186
{\an8}AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY--
THAT'S REALLY [bleep] UP.

32:18.269 --> 32:19.896
{\an8}- WE WERE ALL DANCING
WITH EVERYBODY, THOUGH.

32:19.979 --> 32:20.730
{\an8}- YEAH.
- LIKE, IT WASN'T LIKE SEXUAL.

32:20.813 --> 32:23.066
{\an8}- YEAH, IT WAS HOUSE MUSIC.

32:23.149 --> 32:27.028
{\an8}I'LL HAVE FUN WITH ANYONE.
I'LL GRIND WITH VINNY.

32:27.111 --> 32:27.904
{\an8}I'LL GET RIGHT UP
IN A BOY'S FACE.

32:27.987 --> 32:30.531
{\an8}JUST BECAUSE YOU SEE
OUR FACES CLOSE

32:30.615 --> 32:34.535
{\an8}DOESN'T MEAN I'M [bleep] HIM.

32:34.619 --> 32:37.246
{\an8}- IT WASN'T ANYTHING DIRTY.
HE HAD NO REASON TO BE MAD.

32:37.330 --> 32:39.207
{\an8}- NO.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.208
{\an8}- JUST CALL HIM BACK
AND TELL HIM.

32:40.291 --> 32:41.334
{\an8}- I DANCED, BUT THAT'S ALLOWED.

32:41.417 --> 32:45.004
{\an8}IT'S A RELATIONSHIP.
YOU TRUST THE OTHER PERSON.

32:45.088 --> 32:46.881
{\an8}YOU KNOW, YOU LOVE
THE OTHER PERSON,

32:46.964 --> 32:49.175
{\an8}BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU
GOTTA LET SOME [bleep] SLIDE,

32:49.258 --> 32:50.468
{\an8}AND YOU GOTTA BE OPEN
AND STUFF.

32:50.551 --> 32:51.969
[phone line dialing]

32:52.053 --> 32:53.179
- HELLO.

32:53.262 --> 32:54.639
- UM, I JUST WANT TO
LET YOU KNOW

32:54.722 --> 32:56.474
THAT THAT'S [bleep] [bleep].

32:56.557 --> 32:58.476
AND EVEN--SNOOKI EVEN
SAID IT HERSELF.

32:58.559 --> 32:59.894
WE WERE DANCING
TO HOUSE MUSIC,

32:59.977 --> 33:01.396
AND WE WERE BATTLING
ON THE FLOOR.

33:01.479 --> 33:02.105
{\an8}BUT IF YOU WANT TO BE
LIKE THAT,

33:02.188 --> 33:03.106
{\an8}THEN WE CAN JUST END IT NOW.

33:03.189 --> 33:04.857
{\an8}IF THIS IS HOW YOU'RE
GONNA BE EVERY DAY,

33:04.941 --> 33:05.983
{\an8}I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE.

33:06.067 --> 33:07.735

{\an8}THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I GOT PISSED OFF--

33:09.070 --> 33:10.738
{\an8}- EVERY DAY, EVERY DAY
IT'S SOMETHING NEW, THOUGH.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.240
{\an8}YOU'RE THREATENING ME, SAYING
THAT YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE ME.

33:12.323 --> 33:15.576
{\an8}LIKE, IF YOU SEE [bleep],
THERE'S NOTHING TO BE SEEN.

33:15.660 --> 33:18.121
{\an8}WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM WHAT TYPE
OF MUSIC WE WERE DANCING TO?

33:18.204 --> 33:19.914
{\an8}WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM
WHO ELSE WAS ON THE FLOOR

33:19.997 --> 33:22.500
{\an8}AND HOW WE WERE DANCING
AND WHAT MUSIC IT WAS?

33:22.583 --> 33:24.085
{\an8}- I'M PISSED OFF RIGHT NOW.

33:24.168 --> 33:25.586
{\an8}I DON'T LIKE HEARING [bleep]
LIKE THAT.

33:25.670 --> 33:28.756
{\an8}- HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
SNOOKI, COME HERE.

33:28.840 --> 33:32.301

33:35.179 --> 33:37.557
{\an8}IT WASN'T LIKE [bleep] R&amp;B,
LIKE GRINDING MUSIC.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.934
{\an8}WE WERE ALL, LIKE,
ON THE FLOOR, LIKE BATTLING.

33:40.017 --> 33:41.102
{\an8}IT WAS ALL HOUSE MUSIC.

33:41.185 --> 33:42.478
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.

33:42.562 --> 33:43.438
{\an8}- LIKE, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO
WORRY ABOUT.

33:43.521 --> 33:45.898
{\an8}LIKE, I'M TELLING YOU
THE HONEST TRUTH.

33:45.982 --> 33:47.191
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.

33:47.275 --> 33:48.651
{\an8}- AND DON'T GET WORKED UP
OVER NOTHING, OKAY?

33:58.369 --> 33:59.537
{\an8}SHE CARES ABOUT HIM.

33:59.620 --> 34:00.955
{\an8}BUT THEY'RE ALWAYS FIGHTING

34:01.038 --> 34:01.622
{\an8}ABOUT JUST STUPID
RANDOM [bleep].

34:01.706 --> 34:03.791
{\an8}- OKAY, I MISS YOU.

34:46.458 --> 34:47.835
{\an8}- IT'S THE JERSEY SHORE.

35:11.359 --> 35:12.693
{\an8}WE LIVE TOGETHER.

35:12.777 --> 35:13.861
{\an8}AND THE FACT THAT I HAVEN'T
SEEN HER IN TWO WEEKS,

35:13.945 --> 35:15.321
{\an8}IT'S REALLY HARD.

{\an8}THAT WE'VE BEEN AWAY
