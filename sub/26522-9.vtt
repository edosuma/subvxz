WEBVTT

00:17.934 --> 00:18.768
Liv.

00:19.310 --> 00:20.228
Mmm.

00:20.895 --> 00:22.105
You dozed off, huh?

00:22.522 --> 00:23.356
Mmm.

00:24.524 --> 00:25.775
I guess I did.

00:27.485 --> 00:28.903
I'll help you carry them up.

00:28.987 --> 00:31.406
No. I'll take this while I can get it.

00:33.324 --> 00:36.453
Do you remember when Steve
and Shirl were this little?

00:37.287 --> 00:38.204
Yeah.

00:39.247 --> 00:40.874
They grow up, that's for sure.

00:41.249 --> 00:43.626
Pretty soon they won't be
caught dead like this.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.296
Oh, they'll go full Theo on you,
you can't prevent it.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.256
Well, you know that one.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.051
She would never,
not even when she was little.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.015
I wish I could just freeze them.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.602
Keep 'em just like this forever.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.150
Your arms asleep?

01:07.984 --> 01:09.194
No, I'm...

01:15.450 --> 01:16.493
You guys coming?

01:19.788 --> 01:20.622
Yeah.

01:21.873 --> 01:22.707
Yeah.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.087
Here we go, sweetheart.
Let's go to bed.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.080
My God, what a storm.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.458
We slept through it, I suppose.

02:49.460 --> 02:50.962
I hate storms.

02:51.796 --> 02:52.630
Hate them.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.340
Since I was a little girl.

02:55.967 --> 02:56.843
And this one...

02:59.220 --> 03:03.641
I slept through most of it, too,
but it gave me the strangest dreams.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.268
I actually like them.

03:05.602 --> 03:06.644
They relax me.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.023
My daughter, though,
is terrified of them.

03:10.398 --> 03:12.525
-I hope she moves past that.
-Hmm.

03:13.651 --> 03:16.154
I guess it's all about how we feel
when we're young.

03:16.237 --> 03:17.780
Doesn't ever really change.

03:17.864 --> 03:18.865
I suppose not.

03:18.948 --> 03:22.660
When I was 12,
my dad died unexpectedly.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.455
-I'm sorry.
-Me, too.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.790
It was a car accident, and...

03:28.791 --> 03:30.919
one day he was there,
the next day wasn't.

03:31.961 --> 03:33.796
I didn't really know
how to handle it.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.674
I just was numb.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.259
I didn't even cry.

03:39.177 --> 03:40.428
Not even at the burial.

03:41.471 --> 03:42.805
That isn't unusual.

03:43.097 --> 03:44.432
Especially for a child.

03:45.266 --> 03:47.185
A couple days after the funeral,

03:47.268 --> 03:50.021
my mom left me at home
with my little sister.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.024
And I was sitting in the living room

03:53.691 --> 03:55.193
in my dad's recliner.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.154
It always made me feel so small
sitting there.

03:59.656 --> 04:00.615
And suddenly,

04:01.783 --> 04:02.659
it bubbled up,

04:03.326 --> 04:05.954
and I felt it all, finally.

04:06.996 --> 04:08.456
I started bawling.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.583
It was-- A dam just broke.

04:11.709 --> 04:14.921
And right then, I-- I heard
these taps on the window.

04:15.546 --> 04:16.381
Rain.

04:17.173 --> 04:20.176
And I thought it was weird,
because it had been sunny just before

04:20.260 --> 04:21.761
and it wasn't supposed to rain,

04:21.844 --> 04:23.012
but... but it got...

04:24.097 --> 04:25.682
it got violent.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.559
I thought it had to be hail.

04:29.310 --> 04:31.187
It just had to be, making that noise.

04:32.897 --> 04:34.190
So I cried harder,

04:34.649 --> 04:36.442
and the hail came harder, too.

04:37.694 --> 04:40.113
And I'd been through hail before,
but not like that.

04:40.863 --> 04:42.907
No, this sounded like... like rocks,

04:42.991 --> 04:45.118
like actual stones.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.662
One of the windows
in my sister's room broke,

04:47.745 --> 04:50.373
and Janet's shrieking,
and I ran in there and--

04:51.374 --> 04:52.625
And I could see it.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.044
It was rocks.

04:55.670 --> 04:58.673
It was-- It was small, black stones

04:58.756 --> 05:01.509
hitting the windows,
bouncing up off the ground outside.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.345
I saw the stone
that broke the window, too,

05:04.429 --> 05:05.763
right there on the carpet.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.390
It was about this big.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.268
And my mom came running in,

05:10.351 --> 05:12.395
and she was bleeding from her scalp,
I remember that.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.731
Just from running up the driveway,
she got hit.

05:14.814 --> 05:17.608
And-- And she grabbed me and Janet,

05:17.692 --> 05:20.028
and she held onto us
and we rode it out.

05:21.946 --> 05:23.740
And as suddenly as it started,

05:25.116 --> 05:26.284
it just stopped.

05:27.869 --> 05:28.911
Silence.

05:30.872 --> 05:34.042
It's happened before, you know.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.628
Harrisonville, Ohio, 1901, it rained

05:38.296 --> 05:40.048
small stones over a whole town.

05:40.673 --> 05:43.426
And then once in Sicily,
but that was because of Mount Etna.

05:43.509 --> 05:47.388
It spewed out pumice stone
that fell on Sicily.

05:48.973 --> 05:51.017
It happens in Revelations as well.

05:52.977 --> 05:53.978
It does, doesn't it?

05:54.604 --> 05:57.523
"Hailstones as heavy as a talent,"
it says.

05:58.941 --> 06:00.276
How heavy is a talent?

06:01.110 --> 06:02.904
About 75 pounds, I think.

06:03.738 --> 06:05.615
Yeah, well, it certainly wasn't that.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.533
The world didn't end, but...

06:08.743 --> 06:10.453
I always kind of thought...

06:11.412 --> 06:12.246
I...

06:12.830 --> 06:14.165
I thought it was my fault.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.042
It was me.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.378
I'd had the...

06:19.504 --> 06:23.925
hardest, darkest feelings
of my whole young life that day,

06:24.884 --> 06:27.929
and I just shot them up at the sky,

06:28.304 --> 06:31.808
and somehow those feelings came together
up there in the atmosphere,

06:32.558 --> 06:34.185
and fell right back down on me.

06:35.978 --> 06:38.481
When Daddy died, I made it rain rocks.

06:42.777 --> 06:45.238
These things make perfect sense
when you're a kid.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.951
It's only as you grow up
that they start to sound crazy.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.620
What was it you said to me before?

06:53.121 --> 06:55.540
"There are more things
in Heaven and Earth..."

06:55.790 --> 06:56.707
"Horatio,

06:58.251 --> 07:00.169
than is dreamt of in your philosophy."

07:49.343 --> 07:50.595
Come on, not now.

08:09.071 --> 08:11.199
-I said no, Luke.
-Please?

08:11.282 --> 08:12.742
What's going on in here?

08:12.867 --> 08:14.785
He wants to take some of my clothes.

08:15.286 --> 08:16.120
Okay.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.914
Not for me, for Abigail.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.750
You won't take my stuff
for your imaginary friend.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.210
She's not imaginary!

08:22.293 --> 08:24.128
Please, don't shout.

08:24.462 --> 08:25.713
Abigail's real,

08:25.796 --> 08:28.674
but her clothes aren't as cool as yours.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.009
They look old.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.553
And I thought she'd like new clothes,

08:32.637 --> 08:34.388
and you have so many.

08:35.765 --> 08:36.641
Mom?

08:37.475 --> 08:39.602
She can't have
your sister's clothes, Luke.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.688
-Abigail isn't real, Luke.
-Yes, she is.

08:43.147 --> 08:46.400
-Tell Mom where Abigail lives.
-In the woods.

08:50.696 --> 08:51.697
You kids have fun.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.075
I'll be in my reading room if you need me.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.331
Which room is her reading room?

09:01.791 --> 09:02.875
Leave Mommy alone.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.461
She isn't feeling good lately.

09:54.802 --> 09:55.678
Oh...

10:16.073 --> 10:17.617
My babies.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.138
Mom...

10:48.564 --> 10:49.690
Ah!

10:51.525 --> 10:52.610
Mommy!

10:55.404 --> 10:56.405
Mommy!

11:27.436 --> 11:29.605
I mean, it-- it was the twins.

11:29.689 --> 11:30.648
I know it.

11:31.232 --> 11:33.025
I don't know how I know it, but I...

11:33.901 --> 11:34.777
I do.

11:35.194 --> 11:37.738
I mean, they were adults,
so I didn't recognize them right away,

11:37.822 --> 11:39.824
but the more I looked,

11:40.908 --> 11:41.826
the more I knew.

11:43.077 --> 11:44.662
It was Nellie.

11:45.663 --> 11:46.539
Luke.

11:48.499 --> 11:49.333
That's awful.

11:53.003 --> 11:54.338
What a horrible dream.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.593
And clearly you dozed off
while you were reading.

12:01.846 --> 12:02.680
Yeah.

12:03.180 --> 12:04.140
Of course.

12:05.266 --> 12:06.517
It was a terrible dream.

12:08.519 --> 12:09.854
You know, I've been...

12:11.147 --> 12:12.148
I just...

12:12.690 --> 12:14.817
My headaches are almost constant

12:15.484 --> 12:16.444
now, and...

12:17.111 --> 12:18.571
my dreams are so vivid.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.158
You know those dreams that feel
more real than life?

12:25.369 --> 12:26.454
I think maybe...

12:29.415 --> 12:32.251
Well, both of us have been feeling
a little loopy lately.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.255
I still can't believe I did this.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.302
It hurts like a bitch.

12:45.389 --> 12:47.433
I just feel so stupid, you know?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.186
I don't know if it's the...

12:50.978 --> 12:54.148
the mold or the chemicals,
the noise down there,

12:54.231 --> 12:56.025
I just-- I spaced.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.819
You know, I can't believe I didn't look.

12:58.903 --> 13:01.947
You thought it was unplugged.
I mean, it was supposed to be unplugged.

13:05.117 --> 13:07.369
I may have put too much on poor Stevie.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.957
He's tough, he can handle it.

14:22.528 --> 14:23.487
Honey.

14:25.072 --> 14:26.323
Honey, someone's in the house.

14:27.783 --> 14:28.617
Hugh.

14:54.059 --> 14:54.894
Shh...

15:15.372 --> 15:16.373
Well, come on.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.167
Shake a leg.

15:25.799 --> 15:26.634
Ah!

15:27.426 --> 15:29.345
I love what you did with the room.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.181
It was a dressing room for me.

15:32.890 --> 15:33.933
Then a nursery.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.936
I'm dreaming, aren't I?

15:37.770 --> 15:38.687
'Course you are.

15:39.688 --> 15:42.149
I'm a dream, and so are you,
and so are we.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.404
You are a looker, aren't you?

15:48.113 --> 15:51.033
A real tomato.
Willie's going to just love you.

15:51.575 --> 15:52.743
And this room,

15:53.285 --> 15:56.121
I'd swear I could almost hear
the sounds of the city.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.749
God, I miss the sounds of the city.

15:58.832 --> 16:00.668
The car horns always made me laugh.

16:01.752 --> 16:02.670
Come sit.

16:02.962 --> 16:03.796
Mmm.

16:06.382 --> 16:09.927
Well, Momma, excuse me for saying,
but you're just beat, aren't you?

16:10.719 --> 16:12.179
You want to talk about it?

16:13.722 --> 16:14.974
I'm not sure that I do.

16:15.349 --> 16:16.475
It's your dream.

16:23.399 --> 16:24.233
I...

16:25.943 --> 16:29.113
I had one crib about here, I think.

16:30.698 --> 16:33.242
I painted little boats on it, blue boats,

16:33.325 --> 16:36.120
so he'd float off to sleep
and dream of blue water.

16:36.829 --> 16:40.290
Painted it myself, and he was
so happy in that crib,

16:40.374 --> 16:43.669
and it broke me,
just broke me, to see it empty.

16:46.672 --> 16:49.258
You try and try and keep them safe.

16:50.175 --> 16:53.846
All you can do, really,
but it's hard, isn't it?

16:55.055 --> 16:57.307
And you can't keep them safe forever.

16:57.474 --> 16:58.308
Can you?

17:01.270 --> 17:02.396
Losing a child.

17:02.479 --> 17:05.274
Do you think there's a thing
worse than that?

17:06.442 --> 17:07.443
No.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.904
I don't think there's anything
worse than that.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.240
I don't think there could be.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.035
I had a dream,

17:16.744 --> 17:17.911
a few nights ago,

17:18.829 --> 17:21.290
during the storm,
that I lost my little girl.

17:22.624 --> 17:24.376
I couldn't find her anywhere.

17:25.502 --> 17:27.379
And it felt so real.

17:28.088 --> 17:30.716
I dreamed I lost my little girl once.

17:31.008 --> 17:35.888
I dreamed that she was choking
on her own body for no reason.

17:35.971 --> 17:39.224
Just trying for air
like the room was underwater,

17:39.308 --> 17:42.478
and shaking like she was in the hot squat,

17:42.561 --> 17:46.106
and I dreamed I held her little hand
and sat at her side,

17:46.190 --> 17:48.609
and days, it took days, weeks,
it took weeks

17:48.692 --> 17:50.402
for her to quit gulping that watery air,

17:50.486 --> 17:52.654
quit gaping at me
like a fish on the beach,

17:52.738 --> 17:54.531
but finally she did.

17:55.574 --> 17:58.243
She breathed, ragged and hard,

17:58.327 --> 18:01.038
and she went stiff,
and one of her eyes turned red as blood,

18:01.121 --> 18:03.874
and she'd shake, she'd shake so bad
the bed would shake,

18:03.957 --> 18:06.376
and when she started shaking,
it went fast.

18:06.668 --> 18:07.836
She dangled.

18:08.378 --> 18:09.379
She died.

18:11.465 --> 18:12.716
And my boy...

18:14.259 --> 18:17.137
I once dreamed his little legs

18:17.221 --> 18:18.889
stopped working, they just...

18:19.681 --> 18:23.435
stopped one day...
and he couldn't walk

18:23.977 --> 18:26.772
and he couldn't stand
and he couldn't speak

18:26.855 --> 18:29.691
and then he couldn't do anything
but cry.

18:30.442 --> 18:32.653
Cry and bang on the walls.

18:33.403 --> 18:36.448
Bang on the walls for help
and bang on the walls for Momma

18:36.532 --> 18:38.534
and just bang, bang, bang, bang,

18:38.617 --> 18:40.369
and he couldn't even see.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.746
In the end, he couldn't see me
there with him,

18:42.830 --> 18:45.165
and then he stopped banging,
he stopped crying,

18:45.249 --> 18:47.042
he stopped it all once he died.

18:48.544 --> 18:52.923
I held him so long
that he went cold in my arms.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.937
But that was just a dream.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.106
Just a dream.

19:10.315 --> 19:11.316
The worst dream.

19:12.401 --> 19:13.569
A screaming meemie.

19:15.404 --> 19:16.530
But then I woke up.

19:18.574 --> 19:21.326
And they were safe in their beds.

19:33.213 --> 19:35.257
They're perfect, aren't they?

19:38.177 --> 19:39.052
Oh..

19:40.387 --> 19:43.056
They're the elephant's eyebrows,
those two.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.102
And I bet you'd do anything for them.

19:47.603 --> 19:48.729
Ain't that so?

19:50.439 --> 19:51.315
Yes.

19:52.774 --> 19:53.734
So what if...

19:54.401 --> 19:55.736
they was having a dream?

19:57.613 --> 19:58.947
I mean, bad ones.

19:59.740 --> 20:02.451
I mean posi-lutely screamin' meemies.

20:03.118 --> 20:04.870
The worst of the worst.

20:06.538 --> 20:07.539
What would you do?

20:10.751 --> 20:12.878
I'd wake them up.

20:13.629 --> 20:15.797
I mean a dream so mean,

20:16.673 --> 20:17.925
so scary.

20:19.551 --> 20:20.636
A dream about

20:21.136 --> 20:22.054
sick

20:22.596 --> 20:23.597
and sad

20:24.890 --> 20:26.475
and disease

20:27.100 --> 20:28.352
and rot

20:28.602 --> 20:29.811
and loss

20:30.646 --> 20:31.980
and darkness.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.068
If they was stuck in that dream,

20:36.401 --> 20:37.444
you'd wake 'em.

20:39.112 --> 20:40.822
-Of course.
-And keep them safe.

20:41.657 --> 20:44.326
No more bad dreams,
no more screaming meemies.

20:44.409 --> 20:47.412
You'd wake 'em up
and you'd keep 'em just perfect.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.039
Just like they is,

20:49.665 --> 20:50.707
wouldn't you?

20:50.832 --> 20:51.959
I would.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.962
Well, mitt me, kid,

20:56.922 --> 20:58.548
'cause I got a secret.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.386
A way to wake 'em up.

21:03.387 --> 21:05.305
A way to keep 'em safe...

21:06.098 --> 21:08.976
if they get stuck in them dreams.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.020
What is it?

21:20.529 --> 21:21.989
-Liv!

21:23.991 --> 21:24.825
Hugh?

21:33.375 --> 21:35.210
-Liv, what the fuck?
-I...

21:35.669 --> 21:36.628
I'm sorry, I was...

21:37.629 --> 21:40.674
I was-- I was having a horrible dream.

21:40.757 --> 21:41.758
You think?

21:42.009 --> 21:43.927
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.595
I-- I don't even know what...

21:46.221 --> 21:48.390
-What's going on with you?
-Nothing.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.976
You're holding a fucking screwdriver
to my throat!

21:51.059 --> 21:52.269
No, I wasn't.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.688
I... I was...

21:57.482 --> 22:00.110
I guess I could see
if Janet's up for a visit.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.072
Just for a couple days or something.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.490
That could be good.

22:05.782 --> 22:07.534
-Just a few.
-But how?

22:08.910 --> 22:11.121
You'd have to juggle the kids
and the house--

22:11.204 --> 22:12.414
I'll manage.

22:14.082 --> 22:17.461
I just think I've underestimated
these migraines, you know?

22:17.919 --> 22:19.588
These constant dreams.

22:19.880 --> 22:20.756
I know.

22:21.923 --> 22:22.966
You're just tired.

22:24.384 --> 22:27.137
It just snuck up on me all of a sudden.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.222
But, um...

22:31.350 --> 22:32.392
I'll sort it out.

22:36.104 --> 22:37.022
I promise.

22:53.497 --> 22:54.331
Slow down, kids.

23:14.684 --> 23:15.936
Liv? Liv.

23:27.572 --> 23:29.908
-Goodnight, button.
-Goodnight.

23:30.992 --> 23:33.745
- I love you so much.
-I love you, too.

23:36.081 --> 23:37.999
Now, I want you two to get good rest.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.918
What if I have a bad dream?

23:40.794 --> 23:41.837
Like what?

23:42.379 --> 23:43.797
Like the old Bent-Neck Lady?

23:44.965 --> 23:46.925
Or the little blonde girl in the woods?

23:47.801 --> 23:49.553
Not the Bent-Neck Lady.

23:50.303 --> 23:52.222
What if I have a worse dream?

23:52.973 --> 23:55.475
Well, I'm sure we can handle
any dream you have.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.978
What if I dream that you kill us?

23:59.563 --> 24:00.439
What?

24:01.148 --> 24:06.111
What if I dream that you sent us away
into the dark and we get hurt?

24:06.194 --> 24:07.237
Really hurt.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.948
You send us away, out into the dark,

24:10.031 --> 24:14.202
and my heart breaks right in half,
and I can't feel anything happy,

24:14.619 --> 24:18.248
for weeks and months and years
until I can't stand it anymore.

24:18.331 --> 24:20.500
And I-- I have to die.

24:21.418 --> 24:23.128
And what if I'm so sad

24:23.712 --> 24:26.006
and scared of the dark out there,

24:26.089 --> 24:27.924
that I put poison in me?

24:29.301 --> 24:31.970
I poison myself for years and years,

24:32.053 --> 24:36.266
until my blood turns into poison,
my body breaks down.

24:37.476 --> 24:41.188
You send us out there into the dark
and the dark gets us,

24:41.813 --> 24:45.692
a piece at a time,
over years and years and years,

24:45.984 --> 24:49.988
until I'm on a silver table,
with my jaw wired shut,

24:50.489 --> 24:52.866
and Luke is dead and cold on the floor

24:53.116 --> 24:54.993
with a needle in his arm.

24:55.535 --> 24:57.704
And it was you that killed us,

24:58.038 --> 24:59.748
because you sent us out there,

25:00.373 --> 25:01.249
in the night,

25:02.501 --> 25:03.585
in the dark.

25:05.086 --> 25:06.463
I would never.

25:06.546 --> 25:07.797
What did you say?

25:09.007 --> 25:10.258
I would never.

25:10.675 --> 25:12.052
Would you wake us up

25:12.719 --> 25:14.012
from a dream like that?

25:14.262 --> 25:15.347
Of course.

25:15.555 --> 25:17.015
And keep us safe?

25:17.265 --> 25:18.266
Of course.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.519
But are we safe with you, Mommy?

25:21.269 --> 25:22.395
Are we really?

25:22.729 --> 25:23.563
What?

25:24.105 --> 25:25.565
What do you mean, sweetheart?

25:26.483 --> 25:28.193
Of course you're safe with me.

25:30.111 --> 25:31.446
-Mom?

25:32.864 --> 25:33.865
Are you okay?

25:36.368 --> 25:37.577
Where are the twins?

25:37.661 --> 25:38.912
They're downstairs.

25:40.997 --> 25:41.957
Of course.

25:43.291 --> 25:45.919
-Are you sure you're--
-I'm fine, sweetie, I'm fine.

25:57.889 --> 25:59.307
Oh, I didn't see you.

26:00.892 --> 26:01.810
Hmm.

26:02.185 --> 26:03.228
I'm hiding.

26:03.937 --> 26:05.855
It's amazing, a house this size,

26:06.273 --> 26:09.442
it's really, really hard to find a corner
to yourself.

26:12.404 --> 26:13.738
What you doing with those?

26:15.282 --> 26:18.535
These are actually for a little project
your son is working on,

26:18.618 --> 26:20.203
but don't tell him I told you.

26:20.287 --> 26:21.246
It's a surprise.

26:21.913 --> 26:22.789
For me?

26:22.872 --> 26:23.915
That's right.

26:25.417 --> 26:26.251
He's...

26:28.128 --> 26:29.796
He's worried about you.

26:34.676 --> 26:35.802
Are you all right?

26:37.345 --> 26:39.180
You homeschool, don't you, Clara?

26:40.724 --> 26:41.600
I do.

26:42.684 --> 26:44.019
I think I understand that.

26:44.853 --> 26:46.146
I didn't used to,

26:47.689 --> 26:50.317
but if I think too long
about the world out there...

26:50.984 --> 26:53.445
My little one is better with me.

26:53.987 --> 26:55.655
I know it. I know it well.

26:56.072 --> 26:57.991
I've always thought our whole job was

26:58.867 --> 27:00.910
just getting them ready for the world.

27:01.786 --> 27:03.496
But I don't know why.

27:03.580 --> 27:06.207
I... look at my little ones
right now and...

27:08.126 --> 27:09.044
I just feel...

27:10.754 --> 27:11.838
terror...

27:13.381 --> 27:15.717
at them outside those walls.

27:19.179 --> 27:21.431
It's like I have a rock in my gut.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.061
It's just anxiety.

27:27.103 --> 27:28.813
And thank goodness I have Hugh.

27:30.190 --> 27:31.232
He's my line.

27:32.984 --> 27:36.154
I've always needed someone
to keep me grounded,

27:36.613 --> 27:37.822
get me out of my head.

27:39.699 --> 27:42.619
I mean, the kids are safe,
it's just in my head.

27:43.995 --> 27:44.829
No.

27:47.582 --> 27:48.750
No, I'm sorry,

27:49.000 --> 27:51.086
but if you're worried about
your children,

27:51.711 --> 27:54.422
you don't let anyone tell you
what you're feeling is wrong.

27:55.590 --> 27:57.759
You don't let anyone tell you to relax,

27:57.842 --> 28:01.388
especially someone who didn't carry
those souls in their core,

28:01.471 --> 28:02.597
feel them growing.

28:04.933 --> 28:07.560
Stand firm between the world out there

28:07.936 --> 28:09.104
and these little souls,

28:09.187 --> 28:11.064
because the world out there has teeth,

28:11.147 --> 28:12.816
and it is hungry and it is stupid

28:12.899 --> 28:14.484
and it eats and eats mindlessly.

28:14.567 --> 28:16.569
It doesn't care that they're innocent.

28:17.487 --> 28:18.697
You listen to your gut.

28:19.239 --> 28:20.240
Hold the door.

28:21.866 --> 28:23.535
Even if it makes them hate you.

28:24.703 --> 28:25.829
Even if he does.

28:28.331 --> 28:30.458
How much longer are you staying here?

28:31.084 --> 28:32.335
I mean, your family.

28:33.336 --> 28:35.588
We were hoping to be out
by the end of August

28:35.672 --> 28:37.966
so... the kids can go to school,

28:38.049 --> 28:38.883
but...

28:39.592 --> 28:41.886
who knows, now that we have
this mold issue?

28:42.721 --> 28:43.847
August is good.

28:46.474 --> 28:47.809
Better if it's sooner.

28:49.394 --> 28:50.437
And for you,

28:51.187 --> 28:52.814
maybe even sooner than that.

28:54.441 --> 28:55.692
Why would you say that?

28:56.776 --> 28:57.861
It's just a thought.

29:01.489 --> 29:02.490
This house...

29:04.409 --> 29:05.744
it's a strange house.

29:07.996 --> 29:09.581
I've worked here a long time,

29:09.998 --> 29:14.002
and all I can tell you is that it's just
as stupid and hungry as anything else.

29:14.878 --> 29:16.629
We don't stay after dark,

29:17.422 --> 29:18.506
Horace and I.

29:20.091 --> 29:23.052
And my child is not allowed to step foot
in this place.

29:23.553 --> 29:24.471
Not once.

29:28.141 --> 29:31.186
I wasn't even going to help
when you first bought this house.

29:32.729 --> 29:36.274
Horace said he would be helping your man
and asked if I'd join in,

29:37.025 --> 29:38.026
but I said no.

29:39.694 --> 29:42.155
I didn't want to watch anything else
get fed upon.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.075
But then,

29:46.701 --> 29:48.077
he said it was a family.

29:50.371 --> 29:51.247
Little children.

29:53.291 --> 29:55.376
Two children the same age as my...

29:57.504 --> 29:58.880
So I said I would work.

30:00.548 --> 30:01.549
In the daylight.

30:03.176 --> 30:04.469
To keep an eye.

30:06.346 --> 30:07.597
It's just a house.

30:09.015 --> 30:09.849
Maybe.

30:11.267 --> 30:12.936
It's very different in the night.

30:13.770 --> 30:15.146
It's different in the dark.

30:17.273 --> 30:18.733
But you know that, don't you?

30:22.654 --> 30:24.155
I actually, I'm going to...

30:24.864 --> 30:26.115
take a little break.

30:27.283 --> 30:29.160
Heading to my sister's on Monday.

30:29.285 --> 30:31.496
Just... get some air.

30:33.832 --> 30:34.707
Very good.

30:39.546 --> 30:42.215
Well, I should get these to the young man.

30:42.465 --> 30:44.175
Let him finish his project.

30:50.098 --> 30:51.808
I'll pray for you, Olivia.

30:53.142 --> 30:56.396
I know that's not your thing,
but... I always do, every night,

30:56.479 --> 30:58.690
say a prayer for your family
in these walls.

31:00.942 --> 31:03.361
I'll say a few extra tonight, for you.

31:04.988 --> 31:05.947
Thank you, Clara.

31:07.198 --> 31:08.324
I appreciate that.

31:09.993 --> 31:10.827
Ma'am.

31:19.294 --> 31:20.336
You did this?

31:20.503 --> 31:23.381
I mean, this is beautiful.
You did this by yourself?

31:23.965 --> 31:25.425
Thought it might cheer you up.

31:25.967 --> 31:28.136
-Dad said you've been, uh--
-What?

31:29.387 --> 31:30.346
What did he say?

31:32.265 --> 31:33.641
I'm-- I just--

31:33.725 --> 31:35.810
I know you're taking a little vacation.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.270
I wanted to cheer you up.

31:39.063 --> 31:39.939
Sweetie.

31:41.482 --> 31:44.152
How long are you going to be gone?

31:44.444 --> 31:45.361
Not long.

31:45.570 --> 31:48.573
Not long, honey.
I just need a little time away.

31:48.656 --> 31:50.575
It's nothing more than that. Okay?

31:51.534 --> 31:52.410
Okay.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.204
This is perfect.

31:56.205 --> 31:58.291
Thank you. Thank you. I love it.

32:02.420 --> 32:03.922
Mom?

32:05.298 --> 32:06.215
Mommy?

32:13.222 --> 32:14.265
Oh, baby.

32:18.394 --> 32:19.604
Tell me again.

32:20.146 --> 32:21.314
Why?

32:23.983 --> 32:25.443
You're saying it was an accident?

32:25.526 --> 32:28.446
So you accidentally put your hand
through a mirror, Liv?

32:28.529 --> 32:30.573
-I talked to Steve.
-I can't speak to how Steve--

32:30.657 --> 32:32.659
I talked to Steve,
and to hear him tell it--

32:32.742 --> 32:34.744
I can't speak to how Steve tells it.

32:36.996 --> 32:39.123
What am I supposed to do here?

32:40.291 --> 32:42.251
What do you want me to do, huh?

32:42.794 --> 32:45.338
I don't know. I don't know...

32:47.131 --> 32:48.508
I think I do need help.

32:49.384 --> 32:50.802
I think I need your help.

32:51.594 --> 32:52.929
Or someone's. I don't...

32:53.680 --> 32:55.014
I'm not me right now.

32:55.598 --> 32:57.684
I just-- I can't seem to find me.

32:58.267 --> 32:59.227
You're tired.

33:00.395 --> 33:02.146
You're stressed about the flip,

33:02.772 --> 33:04.440
about the kids, you--

33:04.691 --> 33:06.192
-You're stressed.
-No.

33:06.275 --> 33:07.151
You--

33:08.569 --> 33:09.445
I'm not.

33:10.738 --> 33:12.448
I was when we got here.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.076
I was all the things,

33:15.785 --> 33:17.412
all the familiar things.

33:18.246 --> 33:21.040
I was stressed and excited

33:21.124 --> 33:25.211
and content and motivated
and concerned

33:25.294 --> 33:27.797
and exhausted and annoyed.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.800
And grounded and nervous

33:30.883 --> 33:33.219
and creative and proud

33:33.302 --> 33:35.388
and... and all of the things.

33:37.890 --> 33:39.225
But all those colors,

33:40.184 --> 33:41.769
they're all gone now, Hugh.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.356
And there's only one left.

33:47.650 --> 33:48.943
I'm scared.

33:51.988 --> 33:52.989
That's all I am.

33:53.573 --> 33:54.949
There's nothing else.

33:56.534 --> 33:57.869
I'm only scared.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.252
Do you think there's something
wrong with me?

34:06.919 --> 34:08.171
Like-- Like--

34:08.796 --> 34:10.006
Like, really wrong?

34:25.688 --> 34:28.441
I think maybe Monday's
a little late for your trip.

34:32.361 --> 34:34.280
I'll go tomorrow, then.

34:35.490 --> 34:36.574
First thing.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.498
It's gonna be okay, Liv.

34:46.876 --> 34:49.796
But you'll have to handle
the kids and the house--

34:49.879 --> 34:51.005
I can handle it.

34:51.506 --> 34:54.050
-I won't let anything happen to them.
-It's not that simple.

34:54.133 --> 34:55.051
It is.

34:57.053 --> 34:58.012
They'll be fine.

35:00.306 --> 35:01.349
So will you.

35:03.267 --> 35:04.102
Hey.

35:05.603 --> 35:06.562
Look at me.

35:14.153 --> 35:15.196
So will you.

35:20.201 --> 35:21.285
You guys be good.

35:21.619 --> 35:24.413
And take care of your poor,
handsome dad for me, okay?

35:26.332 --> 35:28.668
You still haven't said
how long you'll be gone.

35:28.751 --> 35:29.710
Not long.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.838
Aunt Janet just needs my help
for a little bit.

35:31.921 --> 35:32.964
I could go with you.

35:34.006 --> 35:36.050
I'm afraid not, honey, not this time.

35:37.301 --> 35:39.637
The cab's outside.
I got to get to the airport.

35:40.680 --> 35:41.514
We'll be fine.

35:42.348 --> 35:43.307
You fly safe.

35:45.476 --> 35:47.395
Call me when you get to Janet's, okay?

35:47.937 --> 35:48.813
I will.

35:50.106 --> 35:52.108
-I love you.
-So much.

35:56.487 --> 35:57.572
Mommy?

35:58.072 --> 35:58.906
Yes, sweetie?

35:58.990 --> 36:01.951
Can Abigail spend the night
while you're gone?

36:02.118 --> 36:03.411
Like a sleepover.

36:03.786 --> 36:06.581
Nellie said it was okay.
She can have my bed.

36:06.664 --> 36:07.999
That's fine, sweetie.

36:09.709 --> 36:10.668
Be good.

36:53.085 --> 36:54.045
It's not possible.

37:08.059 --> 37:11.062
Okay, Luke, listen,
you cannot just sit here--

37:11.145 --> 37:13.397
Guys. Guys. Guys!

37:13.564 --> 37:14.732
Quiet, it's your mom.

37:15.191 --> 37:16.234
Oh. Hi, Mom.

37:16.317 --> 37:17.735
How was your flight?

37:17.902 --> 37:18.819
It was fine.

37:19.278 --> 37:20.655
Ask Mom where the couscous is.

37:20.738 --> 37:22.114
-I want the couscous.
-Dad!

37:22.198 --> 37:23.866
I'm not seriously gonna eat this.

37:23.950 --> 37:26.452
-Tastes like cardboard.
-Abigail's coming over tonight, Mom.

37:26.535 --> 37:27.703
Like I said.

37:27.787 --> 37:30.039
-Tell Dad he can't just feed us cereal.
-I'm sorry, honey.

37:30.122 --> 37:31.582
How's-- How's Janet?

37:31.749 --> 37:33.960
-She's fine.
-Well, tell her I said hi.

37:34.043 --> 37:35.419
I'm gonna stay up so late!

37:35.503 --> 37:37.213
Dad! Dad!

37:37.296 --> 37:38.464
Hugh says hi.

37:38.547 --> 37:40.091
Guys! Guys!

37:40.758 --> 37:41.592
Dad.

37:41.676 --> 37:43.386
-Janet says hi.
-Be quiet.

37:43.803 --> 37:45.012
She's making margaritas.

37:45.096 --> 37:47.723
Do you want to call me back later
when the kids have gone to sleep?

37:47.807 --> 37:48.683
Dad!

37:48.766 --> 37:50.226
No, you have your hands full.

37:50.309 --> 37:51.936
-I can hear you, bud.
-Dad!

37:52.019 --> 37:53.771
-Okay.
-Will someone help?

40:04.735 --> 40:05.653
Mom?

40:07.822 --> 40:08.781
Mom!

40:11.784 --> 40:12.618
Oh.

40:13.661 --> 40:14.537
Shirley.

40:16.580 --> 40:17.790
What are you doing here?

40:18.374 --> 40:19.708
I'm looking for food.

40:20.501 --> 40:22.044
Dad really phoned in dinner.

40:23.462 --> 40:25.506
But... what are you doing here?

40:25.589 --> 40:27.383
I thought you were at Aunt Janet's.

40:28.509 --> 40:30.261
I just missed you all so much.

40:31.595 --> 40:32.596
That's all.

40:37.518 --> 40:38.811
Are you dreaming, too?

40:41.105 --> 40:42.064
What?

40:44.859 --> 40:46.277
You grew up so fast.

40:46.986 --> 40:48.028
You and Steve.

40:49.238 --> 40:50.114
Theo, too.

40:52.741 --> 40:55.077
Kittens need their mommies
and then they don't.

40:57.580 --> 40:58.414
Okay.

41:05.504 --> 41:06.547
Go to bed, sweetie.

41:19.852 --> 41:20.895
Nellie.

41:21.479 --> 41:22.396
Luke.

41:24.732 --> 41:25.566
Mommy?

41:25.858 --> 41:27.067
Shh...

41:30.112 --> 41:31.697
Oh, honey, what are you do...

41:35.242 --> 41:36.160
I'm sorry.

41:36.452 --> 41:37.495
Who are...?

41:40.122 --> 41:40.956
Oh.

41:41.248 --> 41:42.708
You're Abigail.

41:42.791 --> 41:45.127
See? I told you she was real.

41:45.461 --> 41:47.922
I'm sorry. Luke said it was okay.

41:48.005 --> 41:51.008
You said she could sleep over,
so did Dad.

41:51.217 --> 41:53.177
I don't want to get in any trouble.

41:53.260 --> 41:55.346
Oh, aren't you just the sweetest?

41:55.888 --> 41:58.599
No, dear, you're not in any trouble.

41:59.391 --> 42:03.687
We were actually about to have
a surprise tea party.

42:04.396 --> 42:05.356
Tea party?

42:05.856 --> 42:07.608
I know, you've been so patient.

42:07.691 --> 42:10.986
But we have to be very quiet
little kittens and follow me, okay?

42:13.656 --> 42:14.490
Oh!

42:15.366 --> 42:16.283
Abigail.

42:16.867 --> 42:18.244
Would you like to join us?

42:24.667 --> 42:25.834
It's open!

42:28.128 --> 42:29.213
You found the key.

42:29.797 --> 42:31.215
You want to know the secret?

42:32.633 --> 42:34.093
We are the key.

42:47.356 --> 42:48.190
No...

42:49.441 --> 42:50.359
Liv...

42:53.779 --> 42:54.697
No.

42:55.406 --> 42:56.991
Ah!

42:57.866 --> 42:59.034
I'm so sorry.

42:59.118 --> 43:00.494
No, I'm-- I'm sorry.

43:01.495 --> 43:02.746
I must have dozed off.

43:04.123 --> 43:06.292
Oh. Are you okay, sweetheart?

43:07.710 --> 43:08.961
What are you doing awake?

43:09.795 --> 43:12.631
I thought you said
Mom was at Aunt Janet's.

43:13.966 --> 43:14.967
She is.

43:15.050 --> 43:18.929
But I just saw her in the kitchen
and she was being really weird.

43:22.099 --> 43:23.058
Abigail,

43:23.934 --> 43:25.436
how do you take your tea?

43:26.270 --> 43:27.187
I don't know.

43:28.272 --> 43:31.191
Abigail's not allowed to leave
her house very much.

43:31.692 --> 43:32.568
Hmm.

43:32.901 --> 43:35.321
-Is that so?
-She's sneaky, though.

43:35.404 --> 43:36.363
Like me.

43:37.489 --> 43:41.327
You can't tell my mom, though.
She worries about everything.

43:42.911 --> 43:43.787
Well,

43:43.871 --> 43:45.372
you're perfectly safe.

43:46.498 --> 43:48.500
That's what this is all about, actually.

43:48.584 --> 43:50.127
Making sure everyone's safe.

43:50.711 --> 43:51.754
Always safe.

44:09.688 --> 44:10.898
It's still a little hot.

44:11.482 --> 44:12.399
You blow on it.

44:14.276 --> 44:15.903
Your cup of stars.

44:16.695 --> 44:17.988
And when you drink it,

44:18.614 --> 44:20.949
you hold your pinkie up, like this.

44:21.033 --> 44:21.867
Mm-hmm.

44:25.371 --> 44:26.664
Oh, wait.

44:26.747 --> 44:27.790
I need mine.

44:35.381 --> 44:36.507
What's wrong?

44:41.804 --> 44:42.846
Nothing.

44:43.931 --> 44:45.057
Nothing at all.

44:46.183 --> 44:47.017
Finally.

44:48.477 --> 44:50.854
You're so beautiful, the three of you.

44:52.773 --> 44:53.649
I'm just--

44:54.108 --> 44:55.442
I'm just so happy.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.640
You don't have to worry now, sweetie.

45:26.724 --> 45:28.726
-About what?
-What you asked me.

45:29.601 --> 45:31.145
That really bad dream.

45:32.604 --> 45:33.981
Of course I'd wake you.

45:34.815 --> 45:36.442
I'm waking us all up.

45:36.734 --> 45:37.985
What dream?

45:44.533 --> 45:47.703
It's okay, she's having a nightmare.
She's going to wake up.

45:47.786 --> 45:49.204
-What's wrong?
-Abigail!

45:49.288 --> 45:51.331
It's just a moment,
then there'll be no more pain.

45:52.207 --> 45:53.333
She's safe.

45:53.667 --> 45:54.501
Drink your tea.

46:06.305 --> 46:07.806
-Hugh!
-Daddy!

46:08.474 --> 46:09.433
Hey, stop!

46:09.516 --> 46:10.726
What are you doing?

46:59.024 --> 47:00.609
It's Abigail in the window!

47:00.901 --> 47:01.902
She's okay!

47:01.985 --> 47:03.612
She's in the window!

47:23.382 --> 47:24.383
Get up.

47:24.758 --> 47:26.468
-Stevie, get up.
-Dad?

47:47.489 --> 47:49.324
No, no, no.

48:00.544 --> 48:01.587
They're in there.

48:13.765 --> 48:15.601
He wants to take 'em away from you.

48:19.146 --> 48:20.230
He wouldn't.

48:23.567 --> 48:24.568
He is, doll.

48:25.736 --> 48:27.571
She lies.

48:40.500 --> 48:42.419
She lies,

48:43.086 --> 48:44.129
that one.

48:45.339 --> 48:46.173
Who?

48:46.506 --> 48:47.382
Poppy.

48:48.300 --> 48:50.177
She's a liar.

48:53.180 --> 48:55.015
Can-- Can you help me?

48:55.682 --> 48:57.851
What can I do for you, dear?

49:01.855 --> 49:03.273
I need to wake up.

49:05.567 --> 49:06.568
Eyes closed!

49:08.445 --> 49:09.321
Oh, God!

49:09.404 --> 49:10.322
No!

49:11.281 --> 49:12.157
Ah!

49:17.454 --> 49:18.413
No...

49:20.707 --> 49:21.833
Get back in the car!

49:21.917 --> 49:23.502
I see Abigail in the window!

49:28.423 --> 49:29.383
Stop!

49:33.845 --> 49:35.013
He's killing them.

49:35.097 --> 49:37.641
He's driving them into the dark.
He's killing them.

49:37.724 --> 49:39.142
He's killing all of them.

49:39.226 --> 49:42.062
-He's driving them toward a silver table.
-Stop.

49:42.145 --> 49:46.233
He's driving them toward disease
and heartbreak and sadness and death,

49:46.316 --> 49:48.777
and those teeth, those teeth
that'll tear and chew

49:48.860 --> 49:51.029
and eat them alive a piece at a time.

49:51.655 --> 49:52.531
Shut up!

50:26.857 --> 50:28.316
Oh, God.

50:32.487 --> 50:33.405
Oh, God.

50:47.252 --> 50:48.128
No.

50:49.129 --> 50:49.963
No...

50:53.175 --> 50:56.219
No, no, no, no, no.

51:12.819 --> 51:14.446
Are you awake now?

52:28.770 --> 52:30.355
He's killing them.

52:32.149 --> 52:33.817
He's killing all of them.

52:34.484 --> 52:35.735
It's okay, sugar.

52:37.237 --> 52:38.363
It's just a dream.

52:39.364 --> 52:40.740
Just a screaming meemie.

52:42.993 --> 52:44.327
I want to wake up.

52:45.579 --> 52:46.580
Then wake up,

52:47.455 --> 52:50.500
and find those little bugs
safe in their beds.

53:04.097 --> 53:05.390
I want to wake up.

53:07.225 --> 53:08.435
So badly.

53:12.272 --> 53:14.107
Why can't I wake up?

54:02.489 --> 54:03.531
All right, guys.

54:03.615 --> 54:05.408
Whoa, it's so cool.

54:05.492 --> 54:06.993
-This is it.
-Huge.

54:07.452 --> 54:08.328
Whoa.

54:08.411 --> 54:10.747
-It's like a castle.
-Bigger than anything I've ever seen.

54:10.830 --> 54:11.831
It's huge.

54:11.915 --> 54:12.916
So big.

54:13.041 --> 54:15.669
-Oh, my God, this is insane.
-Right?

54:15.752 --> 54:17.963
Okay, don't go far,
we still need help unloading the car.

54:18.046 --> 54:19.673
Hey, Luke, stay close. Stay--

54:19.756 --> 54:20.799
Never mind.

54:20.882 --> 54:23.260
-It's freezing in here.
-Oh, don't be so dramatic.

54:23.343 --> 54:24.302
It's awesome.

54:24.386 --> 54:26.471
Yeah, and it'll be awesome
all summer long.

54:26.554 --> 54:29.349
I gotta get my camera.
Do know which bag had my camera?

54:29.432 --> 54:31.893
-Blue bag, still in the car.
-It smells weird, too.

54:32.185 --> 54:35.730
You know, Dad and I have a lot
of work to do, but once we sell it--

54:35.814 --> 54:38.191
-We're gonna be rich!
-Don't say that to them.

54:38.275 --> 54:40.318
-We're gonna be swimming in it!
-Whatever.

54:40.402 --> 54:41.569
Just fix the heat.

54:41.987 --> 54:44.197
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, long day.

54:44.281 --> 54:45.532
Well, at least they're excited.

54:45.615 --> 54:48.159
Mmm. It's gonna be a long summer.

54:48.243 --> 54:50.412
Well, haven't you always wanted
an endless summer?

54:50.495 --> 54:52.330
Did you see the staircase?

54:52.414 --> 54:54.749
It's awesome.
I mean, it's just awesome.

54:54.833 --> 54:56.251
So many books are in there.

54:56.334 --> 54:58.253
You guys can take books
for your summer reading.

54:58.336 --> 55:00.422
Where's my room

55:00.505 --> 55:02.257
-All the rooms are upstairs.
-Upstairs!

55:02.340 --> 55:03.633
I get the biggest one!

55:03.717 --> 55:05.510
They already picked out rooms,
Shirl,

55:05.593 --> 55:08.221
and besides, I'm the oldest
so I should get the biggest room.

55:08.305 --> 55:10.682
Okay, wait up. I'll show you.

55:10.765 --> 55:12.726
And we've already assigned
the bedrooms,

55:12.809 --> 55:14.644
so no fighting over the bedrooms.

55:14.728 --> 55:17.105
Dad, tell Shirley
I'm not sharing a room!

55:17.439 --> 55:18.273
Are you coming?

55:19.065 --> 55:19.941
It's all you.

55:20.025 --> 55:21.359
Ah. Gee, thanks.

55:21.443 --> 55:24.612
Dad, Theo's taking
the green room! I want the green room!

55:24.696 --> 55:26.197
Tough luck, it's done.

55:26.281 --> 55:27.782
I'm on my way. I'll show you.

55:28.992 --> 55:29.909
Are you sure?

55:32.662 --> 55:34.039
You guys go on without me.

55:35.582 --> 55:36.708
How could we?
