00:04.765 --> 00:06.746
What are you doing
up here in Eve's room?

00:06.748 --> 00:09.259
What? I'm just taking some
of this old stuff down.

00:09.261 --> 00:12.089
What? Not the Peyton Manning poster.

00:12.091 --> 00:14.981
I come up here all the
time and look at that.

00:14.983 --> 00:17.306
It just reminds me of a time
when the Broncos didn't suck.

00:17.308 --> 00:19.284
Okay.

00:19.286 --> 00:21.569
Look, Eve doesn't
need this room anymore.

00:21.571 --> 00:24.030
She qualified for the
pilot training program.

00:24.032 --> 00:25.790
It's a ten-year commitment.

00:25.792 --> 00:28.951
And even Air Force pilots don't
need stuffed bears anymore.

00:28.953 --> 00:31.528
Well, we don't have
to change everything.

00:31.530 --> 00:35.283
Oh, honey, you have had a
month to think about this.

00:35.285 --> 00:36.701
That's enough time to grieve.

00:36.703 --> 00:39.128
You know, a lot of people
think you're the emotional one,

00:39.130 --> 00:40.789
but I think you're cold as ice.

00:42.542 --> 00:45.292
We're not using this
room for anything else.

00:45.294 --> 00:49.346
True. True, but, look, I
need it to be different.

00:49.346 --> 00:53.260
Uh, every time I walk by
this room, I burst into tears.

00:53.262 --> 00:56.659
It's-it's like my little
tomboy is-is all grown up,

00:56.661 --> 00:58.389
and now she's a...

00:58.391 --> 01:01.041
- Killing machine.
- What?

01:01.043 --> 01:03.930
A woman. A woman. Look, it...

01:03.932 --> 01:08.182
It just reminds me that this
phase in our lives is over.

01:09.440 --> 01:12.484
Give me Mrs. Huggy Pants.

01:16.348 --> 01:18.548

01:20.989 --> 01:22.664
Mm.

01:26.430 --> 01:28.636
- Oh, hey. Wow, look at that.
- Hi.

01:28.638 --> 01:29.877
You guys are back early.

01:29.879 --> 01:31.686
Well, having Jen help me write the vlogs

01:31.688 --> 01:32.926
- has been very helpful to me.
- Yeah.

01:32.928 --> 01:35.321
- What's in the box?
- Huh? What box?

01:37.360 --> 01:39.226
It's pretty heavy, 'cause
your eyes are twitching.

01:39.228 --> 01:40.678
- Nope.
- So, it must be...

01:42.423 --> 01:44.740
- Mike.
- You're still moving stuff out of Eve's room?

01:44.742 --> 01:46.140
- Come on.
- Can you believe this, Jen?

01:46.142 --> 01:47.814
That you're upset about something?

01:47.816 --> 01:50.641
Yeah, I've seen it before.

01:50.643 --> 01:52.933
Look, Eve is fine with it.

01:52.935 --> 01:55.702
And maybe... maybe we can
use that as a guest room.

01:55.704 --> 01:57.071
Hell no. A guest room?

01:57.073 --> 01:59.139
That means we have to have guests.

01:59.141 --> 02:01.435
We're leaving the room the way it is.

02:01.437 --> 02:03.052
You know, if you don't
like what's in there,

02:03.054 --> 02:04.669
just shut the door, you
won't have to see it.

02:04.671 --> 02:08.009
No. No. Look, I-I just
want to make it comfortable

02:08.012 --> 02:10.400
for Jen's dad for-for graduation week.

02:10.401 --> 02:12.325
You don't need a guest room.

02:12.327 --> 02:13.945
My dad's not coming to graduation.

02:13.947 --> 02:16.948
He's not coming? Since when?

02:16.950 --> 02:19.643
He's so busy, I'd feel
terrible asking him.

02:19.645 --> 02:21.420
- Uh...
- You didn't even ask him?

02:21.422 --> 02:23.600
No. My dad would do anything for me,

02:23.602 --> 02:25.065
and I didn't want to pressure him.

02:25.067 --> 02:27.042
Well, if I were your dad,
I'd want to be here.

02:27.044 --> 02:28.985
Yes. I know that.

02:28.987 --> 02:31.054
It's what makes you awesome.

02:31.056 --> 02:33.498
You're the family who helped
me through high school.

02:33.500 --> 02:36.886
If you're there, that's
all I really need.

02:38.689 --> 02:41.031
We're all she really needs?

02:41.033 --> 02:44.651
So, she's no longer the exchange
student that lives with us.

02:44.653 --> 02:46.854
Now she's a child that we've stolen.

02:52.377 --> 02:54.369
Whoa, hey, hey, Kyle, Kyle.

02:54.371 --> 02:56.655
Kyle, check out this cool
thing my friend sent me.

02:56.657 --> 02:58.707
Oh, uh, we're on the clock, buddy.

02:58.709 --> 03:00.800
If, uh... if it's not work-related,

03:00.802 --> 03:02.886
it's gonna have to wait.

03:02.888 --> 03:05.080
Unless it's something really cool.

03:06.541 --> 03:08.751
You know what? I'll just come over.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.538
It's this audio clip

03:11.540 --> 03:14.030
that's been on the Internet
for the last couple of years.

03:14.032 --> 03:15.891
It's this guy saying this
one word over and over.

03:15.893 --> 03:17.519
Some people think he's saying "Laurel",

03:17.521 --> 03:19.553
and other people think
he's saying "Yanny".

03:19.555 --> 03:21.429
- What?
- No, no, no, no.

03:21.431 --> 03:23.456
I'll play it for you. Here it is.

03:23.458 --> 03:27.353
Laurel. Laurel. Laurel.

03:27.355 --> 03:29.468
Okay. Yeah, he's saying "Laurel".

03:29.470 --> 03:33.067
Well, yeah. No. I hear
"Yanny" clear as a bell.

03:34.337 --> 03:36.278
Is this a prank?

03:37.982 --> 03:40.449
Hey, hey, hey, guys. Yeah,
come-come-come over here.

03:40.451 --> 03:42.718
Tell me what word you hear.

03:42.720 --> 03:46.113
Laurel. Laurel. Laurel.

03:46.115 --> 03:47.580
Ah, this thing?

03:47.582 --> 03:49.783
It's "Laurel", end of story.

03:49.785 --> 03:51.210
Thank you, Kristin.

03:51.212 --> 03:52.347
What? "Laurel"?

03:52.349 --> 03:54.833
Are you nuts? It's saying "Yanny".

03:56.466 --> 03:57.958
Well, hey, let's see what Ed thinks.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.851
- Ed, Ed, what do you hear?
- Yeah.

03:59.853 --> 04:03.647
Laurel. Laurel. Laurel.

04:03.649 --> 04:07.059
Oh. I hear "Get back to work".

04:11.798 --> 04:15.276
I love these Dirty Harry movies.

04:15.278 --> 04:19.938
- Mm.
- "Go ahead. Make my day".

04:19.940 --> 04:22.682
Yeah, a lot of people think
Eastwood came up with that.

04:22.684 --> 04:24.051
Actually, it was me.

04:24.053 --> 04:27.259
Really? You coined the
Dirty Harry catchphrase?

04:27.261 --> 04:28.663
Not just that one.

04:28.665 --> 04:30.651
A lot of times I leave
work, and look at Ed,

04:30.653 --> 04:34.043
and I say, "I'll be back".

04:34.045 --> 04:36.226
And my favorite one of
all time is "More power".

04:36.228 --> 04:38.882
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

04:38.884 --> 04:42.590
Uh, Mike, the, uh...
the eagle has landed.

04:42.592 --> 04:44.696
That's another one, "The
Eagle has landed". One of mine.

04:44.698 --> 04:48.492
No, no, no. No, no, no. The,
uh, the eagle has landed.

04:48.494 --> 04:50.981
- Our eagle? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yes.

04:50.983 --> 04:52.105
Can-can I tell her?

04:52.107 --> 04:53.912
- Yeah.
- Tell me what? Wait.

04:53.914 --> 04:57.280
Eagle? Jeep Eagle? You guys got me a car

04:57.282 --> 04:58.331
- for graduation...
- No, no. No, no.

04:58.333 --> 05:01.586
- ... and it's sitting in the driveway?!
- No. No, no, no. No, no. No.

05:01.588 --> 05:03.168
When have we ever done anything

05:03.170 --> 05:05.242
that makes you think
we're that generous?

05:05.244 --> 05:07.619
This surprise is better.

05:07.621 --> 05:10.197
It turns out your father isn't too busy,

05:10.199 --> 05:14.100
so we invited him to the
graduation, and now...

05:14.102 --> 05:15.760
He's here!

05:15.762 --> 05:17.187
What?

05:17.189 --> 05:19.637
Well, not "here" here.
He's-he's at the airport,

05:19.639 --> 05:21.631
probably near one of
those soft pretzel stands.

05:21.633 --> 05:22.821
- Oh, yeah.
- I should call him,

05:22.823 --> 05:25.195
and have him bring some for everybody.

05:25.197 --> 05:26.496
You knew we were awesome,

05:26.498 --> 05:28.523
but did you know we were this awesome?

05:28.525 --> 05:31.017
This is not awesome.

05:31.019 --> 05:33.295
Hey, what's-what's going on?

05:33.297 --> 05:35.547
Is everything okay with your dad?

05:35.549 --> 05:38.625
Oh, yeah. I love my
dad. I want to see him.

05:38.627 --> 05:40.735
Well, good, 'cause he
flew here from Hong Kong.

05:40.737 --> 05:42.971
I don't want to see his girlfriend.

05:42.973 --> 05:44.948
You don't know that he
brought his girlfriend.

05:44.950 --> 05:48.159
- He did, Mike.
- Okay.

05:48.161 --> 05:51.135
Great. Now you guys
get to meet the woman

05:51.137 --> 05:53.015
who wants to replace my mom.

05:53.017 --> 05:56.081
Well...

05:56.083 --> 05:57.514
Well, it's not gonna be easy,

05:57.516 --> 05:59.922
but we're gonna have
to get her a Jeep Eagle.

06:06.622 --> 06:08.180
Hey, Jen.

06:08.182 --> 06:11.491
Tell us about this girlfriend
that you don't like.

06:11.493 --> 06:12.868
I don't want to talk about it.

06:12.870 --> 06:14.519
I hope you can respect that.

06:14.521 --> 06:15.820
Yeah, of course we can.

06:15.822 --> 06:18.077
Yeah, you-you come and
tell us whenever you want.

06:18.079 --> 06:20.738
Like when the big hand is on now.

06:22.053 --> 06:24.278
Honey, we just want to know
what we're dealing with.

06:24.280 --> 06:26.531
You-you never mentioned that
your dad had a girlfriend.

06:26.533 --> 06:29.276
Well, he does.

06:29.278 --> 06:31.394
Fiona.

06:31.396 --> 06:35.115
All right, well, Fiona.
Come on, it's a lovely name.

06:35.117 --> 06:37.618
Not the way she says it.

06:37.620 --> 06:41.446
For years, she and
my dad were "friends",

06:41.448 --> 06:43.445
but when I was home last summer,

06:43.447 --> 06:46.755
my dad told me their
relationship had "progressed".

06:47.854 --> 06:51.126
- Okay...
- I often tell people that, uh,

06:51.128 --> 06:53.151
progress isn't always the best thing,

06:53.153 --> 06:56.979
but people don't listen, because
they're usually on their phones.

06:56.981 --> 06:59.452
They do everything together now.

06:59.454 --> 07:01.693
They got matching
pajamas this Christmas.

07:01.695 --> 07:03.187
Ugh!

07:04.496 --> 07:06.280
Kind of sorry I saw that.

07:07.741 --> 07:10.862
I have to look that guy in
the eye in two hours, it's...

07:10.864 --> 07:13.420
I don't know what he sees in her.

07:13.422 --> 07:15.520
She's nothing like my mother.

07:15.522 --> 07:19.554
My mom was sweet and
kind and thoughtful.

07:19.556 --> 07:21.237
We know, Jen. But, look, it's-it's just

07:21.239 --> 07:23.268
for a couple days. I'm
sure you can handle that.

07:23.270 --> 07:25.591
- I mean, look, she can't be any worse than Mike.
- Ha.

07:26.677 --> 07:28.731
It's not a contest, honey,

07:28.733 --> 07:30.725
but it's good to know I'm the bar.

07:34.084 --> 07:37.252
Hey, babe. Here is your left shoe.

07:37.254 --> 07:38.454
Oh, thank you.

07:40.361 --> 07:42.851
This morning, I put on a
brown one and a black one.

07:42.853 --> 07:45.581
I... I can't see my feet.

07:47.356 --> 07:50.473
So, I heard about this
whole Laurel and Yanny thing.

07:50.475 --> 07:52.847
You know, the reason why
you hear two different things

07:52.849 --> 07:56.354
is because they're recorded
in two different frequencies.

07:56.356 --> 08:00.021
So... which one did you hear?

08:00.023 --> 08:02.630
Kyle? We agreed not to talk about it.

08:02.632 --> 08:04.663
You're right.

08:04.665 --> 08:06.540
All right. Sorry.

08:06.542 --> 08:11.019
Yeah, but maybe he could break the tie.

08:11.021 --> 08:14.806
Yeah. Go ahead, honey. What do you hear?

08:19.072 --> 08:20.520
Yanny.

08:20.522 --> 08:21.580
- You fool!
- Whoo!

08:21.582 --> 08:23.874
Chuck, we finally win!

08:23.876 --> 08:26.943
Isn't this a pretty picture.

08:26.945 --> 08:31.314
My wife and my best friend
both hearing "Yanny".

08:31.316 --> 08:34.732
Come on, Kyle. Let's get
away from these Yannies.

08:34.734 --> 08:37.470
That is so childish.

08:37.472 --> 08:40.791
Oh, yeah? Well, Laurels
rule and Yannies drool!

08:44.244 --> 08:45.766
Yeah, actually, I heard Laurel;

08:45.768 --> 08:47.343
I just wanted to mess with my wife.

08:52.621 --> 08:54.693
Oh, this thing with Jen
just breaks my heart.

08:54.695 --> 08:57.170
You know, I know I didn't
like the idea of my mom

08:57.172 --> 08:58.488
in a new relationship, either.

08:58.490 --> 09:00.783
Is this about Ed?
He's a good stepfather.

09:00.785 --> 09:02.271
Remember the time he held your hand

09:02.273 --> 09:05.582
- and took you to the park?
- No, stop. Stop. No.

09:05.584 --> 09:07.271
No. Look, after my dad died,

09:07.273 --> 09:09.479
there was a new guy
buzzing around my mom...

09:09.481 --> 09:11.213
mowing the lawn, raking the leaves.

09:11.215 --> 09:13.231
He's called a gardener.

09:13.233 --> 09:15.152
You know, look.

09:15.154 --> 09:16.982
Look, i-if you ever wonder why

09:16.984 --> 09:20.555
I sometimes don't share things
with you, remember this moment.

09:20.557 --> 09:25.358
I got a welcome gift for Fiona,
but only because you made me.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.503
- Ooh, rose quartz.
- Yeah. Yeah.

09:27.505 --> 09:29.008
- Wow, it's beautiful.
- Good idea.

09:29.010 --> 09:31.237
I think it'll be good
to have in the room.

09:31.239 --> 09:35.220
It's said to calm feelings
of anger or resentment.

09:36.406 --> 09:38.373
Kind of like beer.

09:40.134 --> 09:41.657
The first two, not the last six.

09:41.659 --> 09:44.065
That's, that's just a black
eye and a police report.

09:44.067 --> 09:46.207
Oh, all right.

09:46.209 --> 09:47.990
- Okay.
- Okay. All right, good.

09:50.372 --> 09:53.088
- Pa!
- Ah-mui! Ah.

09:53.090 --> 09:55.682
- Hey, Henry. Welcome.
- Ah. Hi, Henry.

09:55.684 --> 09:57.217
- Oh, thanks for having us.
- Yes.

09:57.219 --> 09:59.571
I wouldn't miss Jen's
graduation for the world.

09:59.573 --> 10:01.882
Uh... oh, you must be Fiona.

10:01.884 --> 10:03.818
Yes, we-we are so glad you could come.

10:03.820 --> 10:06.716
- Oh, nice to meet you all.
- Yeah, Mike Baxter. Welcome.

10:06.718 --> 10:08.731
Told you you were overdressed.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.758
Everywhere we go,
you're like Elton John.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.619
Yeah, look at me.

10:12.621 --> 10:13.750
"Rocket Man".

10:13.752 --> 10:16.297
At least it's not matching pajamas.

10:16.299 --> 10:18.083
Yeah.

10:21.452 --> 10:24.186
I think you look nice, Dad.

10:29.042 --> 10:30.541
Uh, so, well,

10:30.543 --> 10:32.386
- let's not stand by the door all night.
- Yeah.

10:32.388 --> 10:34.670
- Come on into the living room.
- Come on. Come on in, sit down. Sit.

10:34.672 --> 10:38.163
- Okay.
- Oh. What a beautiful home.

10:38.165 --> 10:39.403
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

10:39.405 --> 10:42.368
This one's sense of decor
is mid-century bowling alley.

10:44.169 --> 10:45.708
I like our apartment.

10:45.710 --> 10:47.161
So does she.

10:47.163 --> 10:49.155
Not as much as she likes bad jokes.

10:49.157 --> 10:51.180
Oh, it's not a joke.

10:51.182 --> 10:53.313
When you visit, he rents you shoes.

10:54.759 --> 10:56.912
That's funny. That is...

10:56.914 --> 10:59.280
Uh, you know who else is funny?

10:59.282 --> 11:00.847
Say something. Say something.

11:00.849 --> 11:03.434
Okay, okay, all right.
One of my favorite jokes.

11:03.436 --> 11:06.171
- The potato joke.
- No.

11:06.173 --> 11:09.989
Um, so, uh, w-we're so
glad you could be here.

11:09.991 --> 11:11.561
- Uh, h-how was your flight?
- Yeah.

11:11.563 --> 11:13.638
Well, I got a lot of exercise.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.215
- Yeah.
- Up, down, up, down.

11:15.217 --> 11:17.812
I mean, if you're gonna go
to the bathroom every hour,

11:17.814 --> 11:19.052
sit on the aisle.

11:21.647 --> 11:24.638
That's funny. You stick
him in the middle seat,

11:24.640 --> 11:26.923
then complain because
you have to get up.

11:26.925 --> 11:28.893
You could've just switched seats.

11:28.895 --> 11:31.519
Ha, ha, ha. See? I'm being funny, too.

11:32.856 --> 11:34.563
Uh...

11:34.565 --> 11:36.949
Jen, uh, dear, why don't you
come in the kitchen with me,

11:36.951 --> 11:38.159
help me fix some drinks?

11:38.161 --> 11:39.875
I think it's a good
time for the potato joke.

11:39.877 --> 11:42.544
- Two guys are...
- No. No, hey! No, no.

11:42.546 --> 11:44.488
Come, come with us.

11:44.490 --> 11:46.877
I'll stay here and make sure
Henry doesn't steal anything.

11:48.003 --> 11:51.103
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:51.105 --> 11:53.263
Well, the quartz thing didn't work.

11:53.265 --> 11:54.866
Looks like rocks aren't magic.

11:54.868 --> 11:56.701
I told you.

11:56.703 --> 11:58.575
- She's the worst person in the world.
- All right, look,

11:58.577 --> 12:00.237
I-I don't know if she's that bad.

12:00.239 --> 12:02.430
- All she does is put my father down.
- Hey.

12:02.432 --> 12:04.734
That's what couples do. I make
fun of Vanessa all the time.

12:04.736 --> 12:06.314
Yeah, and look, it doesn't bother me.

12:06.316 --> 12:07.666
And you know how you can tell?

12:07.668 --> 12:11.240
I make him dinner, and
yet he's still with us.

12:11.242 --> 12:14.126
I can't believe you both like her.

12:14.128 --> 12:15.881
Look, no, I just met the woman.

12:15.883 --> 12:18.422
Do I want to take a six-hour
car ride with her? No.

12:18.424 --> 12:19.648
Unless it's in a hearse.

12:19.650 --> 12:21.367
You're not helping.

12:21.369 --> 12:23.994
- I didn't say she was in the back.
- Oh, my God.

12:23.996 --> 12:26.737
Sunday is my graduation,

12:26.739 --> 12:28.297
and I don't want her here.

12:28.299 --> 12:30.452
Okay, look, Jen, Jen.

12:30.454 --> 12:33.620
You don't want the memory
of your graduation to be

12:33.622 --> 12:36.474
all about the blowup you had
with your father's girlfriend.

12:38.052 --> 12:39.768
- Okay.
- Good.

12:39.770 --> 12:42.396
Then can I get drunk?

12:42.398 --> 12:44.181
No.

12:44.183 --> 12:45.525
Right?

12:51.800 --> 12:53.830
Okay, hold on, but give me a minute.

12:53.832 --> 12:57.691
Um, then there's Zion,
uh, National Park,

12:57.693 --> 13:01.055
which is gorgeous, beautiful,
certainly worth seeing.

13:01.057 --> 13:03.414
And there you have
all the national parks

13:03.416 --> 13:05.044
in alphabetical order.

13:09.093 --> 13:12.818
Uh, uh, well, you know, I-I love cities.

13:12.820 --> 13:16.181
- Yes. Right.
- So, uh, I like to start with Akron, Ohio.

13:16.183 --> 13:18.794
I-I'd love to hear about it,

13:18.796 --> 13:21.194
but, uh, Fiona and I
are a little jet-lagged.

13:21.196 --> 13:22.595
- Oh, of course.
- Oh. Okay, all right.

13:22.597 --> 13:24.888
Uh, ah-mui, we'll talk tomorrow.

13:24.890 --> 13:27.197
Tomorrow? We didn't
even talk to her tonight.

13:27.199 --> 13:29.336
She's so quiet, this one.

13:29.338 --> 13:32.247
Oh, I can talk. I have a lot to say.

13:32.249 --> 13:35.130
All right, yeah, but they
already said their goodbyes,

13:35.132 --> 13:36.447
so we're just, we're gonna let them go.

13:36.449 --> 13:37.779
And maybe there's a better time for us

13:37.781 --> 13:39.029
to have this conversation, Jen.

13:39.031 --> 13:41.055
It won't take long.

13:41.057 --> 13:47.044
All I have to say is: why?

13:47.046 --> 13:49.305
I-I'll be right back.

13:49.307 --> 13:51.574
Yeah, u-uh...

13:51.576 --> 13:53.260
Uh, did... ?

13:59.646 --> 14:01.259
Uh, Mike, just...

14:01.261 --> 14:03.295
They're not swearing, so
I don't really understand

14:03.297 --> 14:05.139
what they're saying.

14:06.265 --> 14:07.937
I know what they're saying.

14:07.939 --> 14:09.938
Honey, go.

14:09.940 --> 14:11.548
- Tell her the potato joke.
- No, just...

14:18.654 --> 14:20.421
Excuse me, excuse me.

14:20.423 --> 14:22.890
I-I'll first say that
it's-it's a lovely language

14:22.892 --> 14:24.708
when you're arguing like that. It's...

14:24.710 --> 14:26.712
- We weren't arguing.
- Yes, we were.

14:26.714 --> 14:28.437
Well, now you are.

14:28.439 --> 14:32.258
Uh, J-Jen, would you
give us a minute, please?

14:32.260 --> 14:34.777
I want to talk to your
dad for a moment. Please?

14:34.779 --> 14:38.272
Fine. I'm going for a walk.

14:38.274 --> 14:39.423
Don't go far.

14:40.865 --> 14:43.388
- Listen, I...
- Sorry.

14:43.390 --> 14:45.655
She's complaining about Fiona.

14:45.657 --> 14:47.893
She doesn't understand
what I like about her.

14:47.895 --> 14:49.427
Well, I got to be honest,
I kind of wondered

14:49.429 --> 14:51.668
the same thing myself. I just...

14:51.670 --> 14:55.222
Yes, I know, Fiona
has a big personality.

14:55.224 --> 14:56.757
It's just what I needed.

14:56.759 --> 15:00.352
Just, I-I've never really
needed to get my balls busted.

15:02.607 --> 15:04.415
But I-I got to be honest,

15:04.417 --> 15:07.093
I-I don't think this
is just about Fiona.

15:07.095 --> 15:08.727
Eh, I don't, either.

15:08.729 --> 15:13.298
Jen wants things to stay
the way they used to be.

15:13.300 --> 15:14.917
- But they don't.
- No, no.

15:14.919 --> 15:18.138
It's okay for her to go
forward with her life,

15:18.140 --> 15:19.963
but she doesn't want me to move on.

15:19.965 --> 15:21.957
Y-You understand. You have daughters.

15:21.959 --> 15:25.611
Yeah, I've got, uh, two
married daughters and, uh...

15:25.613 --> 15:28.781
and my, uh, y-youngest is, um, Eve.

15:28.783 --> 15:31.702
- Mm.
- She's in, uh, Air Force Academy.

15:31.704 --> 15:34.236
Well, while Eve is away,
I'm sure she doesn't want

15:34.238 --> 15:36.772
things here at home to change, either.

15:36.774 --> 15:38.456
Yes.

15:38.458 --> 15:41.444
There has been some resistance
around here about that.

15:42.396 --> 15:44.488
So you understand.

15:46.058 --> 15:49.994
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I-I understand.

16:02.282 --> 16:05.993
Really? You're not even
gonna say good morning?

16:05.995 --> 16:09.429
Why should I? I don't
know what you people hear.

16:10.758 --> 16:12.383
Just drop it, Kyle.

16:12.385 --> 16:13.726
No, it's no big deal.

16:13.728 --> 16:18.247
All I'm saying is I don't know you!

16:18.249 --> 16:20.616
- Hey, Kristin.
- Hey, Kyle.

16:20.618 --> 16:22.693
Oh, I see you two are
on a first-name basis.

16:23.956 --> 16:27.089
Oh, so you can you hear that,
but you don't hear Laurel?

16:27.091 --> 16:28.881
- No, I hear Yanny.
- Laurel.

16:28.883 --> 16:30.766
- Yanny. Yanny.
- Laurel. Laurel. Laurel.

16:30.768 --> 16:32.394
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

16:32.396 --> 16:34.396
I want to say something here.

16:34.398 --> 16:36.790
Yanny, Yanny, Yanny, Yanny, Yanny!

16:38.920 --> 16:41.820
Time-out, time-out.

16:41.822 --> 16:45.849
I got a recording of my own
I want you all to listen to.

16:45.851 --> 16:48.525
Just let me know what you hear. Tell me.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.225
I can't really make anything out.

16:55.227 --> 16:56.927
It sounds like a bunch
of people at a party.

16:56.929 --> 16:58.503
Yeah, w-what is this thing, Ed?

16:58.505 --> 17:01.023
It's you knuckleheads
hanging out last week.

17:03.093 --> 17:07.045
- Sounds like we were having a really good time.
- You were.

17:07.047 --> 17:10.881
And then we let all this
Laurel-Yanny stuff split us up.

17:10.883 --> 17:14.815
You did. See, "out there"
everybody's always fighting.

17:14.817 --> 17:18.647
They're, I mean, they're looking
for things to fight about.

17:18.650 --> 17:20.751
I don't want that in here, folks.

17:22.130 --> 17:24.121
I-I don't, either.

17:24.123 --> 17:26.857
From now on,

17:26.858 --> 17:29.935
let's not talk about
things that separate us.

17:29.937 --> 17:33.123
Agreed. Let's just stick
to politics and religion.

17:39.369 --> 17:41.175
Did you finally cave

17:41.177 --> 17:43.682
and agree to let Vanessa
change Eve's room?

17:43.684 --> 17:47.194
No, actually, we've
invited Fiona to move in.

17:49.440 --> 17:51.565
Ha, ha.

17:51.567 --> 17:53.701
I miss Eve.

17:56.655 --> 18:01.124
But I don't think she's moving back.

18:01.126 --> 18:05.975
I just have to accept the
fact that things change.

18:05.977 --> 18:08.242
Wow. The way you were acting,

18:08.244 --> 18:10.217
I didn't think you
would ever accept that.

18:10.219 --> 18:11.993
Well...

18:11.995 --> 18:14.108
I'm having a little
difficulty moving on.

18:14.110 --> 18:16.732
Uh, it's probably my age.

18:16.734 --> 18:21.595
More likely, 'cause I loved
the way things used to be.

18:21.597 --> 18:24.690
I've got to learn to make
the best of it, you know?

18:26.544 --> 18:29.028
It's not like I have a choice.

18:31.082 --> 18:33.449
I get it. You're talking about me, too.

18:33.451 --> 18:35.426
But maybe I don't want to move on.

18:35.428 --> 18:38.411
I'm not talking about you.
I was talking about your dad.

18:38.413 --> 18:39.763
You know, he wants to move on.

18:39.765 --> 18:42.124
He's having a hard time,
and I understand that.

18:44.170 --> 18:46.879
And do you want to
make it harder for him?

18:52.712 --> 18:55.404
You want some help?

18:55.406 --> 18:56.630
Sure, that'd be great.

18:56.632 --> 18:58.598
Um, just pack her sweaters up.

18:58.600 --> 19:01.327
There's two boxes over there.

19:01.329 --> 19:04.930
Mike Baxter here for Outdoor
Man talking about change.

19:04.932 --> 19:08.642
Now, nature is full of change.
Sometimes that change is good.

19:08.644 --> 19:10.776
A caterpillar goes into a slimy cocoon

19:10.778 --> 19:12.596
and emerges a gorgeous butterfly.

19:12.598 --> 19:15.649
On the other hand, some
change is, well, hard.

19:15.651 --> 19:18.778
When a bear cub says
goodbye to the cave,

19:18.780 --> 19:21.136
he leaves behind two
very sad bear parents

19:21.138 --> 19:23.013
who feel like they have
nothing left in life,

19:23.015 --> 19:25.267
except selling toilet paper...

19:25.269 --> 19:27.086
and mauling campers.

19:28.764 --> 19:31.277
But there's two ways
of looking at change.

19:31.279 --> 19:33.902
You can either focus
on what you're losing,

19:33.904 --> 19:36.430
or celebrate what you're gaining.

19:38.065 --> 19:41.008
To quote the novelist Hermann Hesse,

19:41.010 --> 19:43.668
"Some of us think holding
on makes us strong,

19:43.670 --> 19:46.497
but sometimes it is letting go".

19:46.499 --> 19:51.485
Great advice for life, bad
advice if you're rock climbing.

19:55.216 --> 19:58.801
My advice for dealing with
change? Take baby steps.

19:58.803 --> 20:01.321
Like, maybe you used to go
camping with your family

20:01.323 --> 20:02.938
in a 200-square-foot tent.

20:02.940 --> 20:05.557
Then the kids moved out,
and now when you go camping,

20:05.559 --> 20:07.584
you and your old lady feel like

20:07.586 --> 20:09.653
the last two people at a circus.

20:09.655 --> 20:11.788
That's why this month at Outdoor Man,

20:11.790 --> 20:16.389
we're inviting you empty nesters
to trade in your old family tent

20:16.391 --> 20:19.498
for a discount on our
new, cozy, two-person tent.

20:19.500 --> 20:22.040
Insulated, easy setup, water-resistant.

20:22.042 --> 20:24.973
Now, the only thing it can't do
is protect you from those bears.

20:24.975 --> 20:27.271
But don't worry, they probably
just want to show you photos

20:27.273 --> 20:28.880
of their cubs and grand-cubs.

20:28.882 --> 20:31.356
And then they're gonna maul you.

20:31.358 --> 20:32.416
Baxter out.

20:37.411 --> 20:39.600
Okay, these two guys
are at the beach, right?

20:39.602 --> 20:42.362
Santa Monica Pier, they're
sitting there, and one guy tells

20:42.364 --> 20:44.331
the other guy, "You know,
women never pay attention to me.

20:44.333 --> 20:45.856
You always get attention from women.

20:45.858 --> 20:47.231
Is there any trick I can do?"

20:47.233 --> 20:49.844
The guy says, "It's a trick I
don't usually tell many people.

20:49.846 --> 20:51.302
Here's what I want you to do.

20:51.304 --> 20:53.763
Get a potato, put it
in your bathing suit".

20:53.765 --> 20:55.906
The guy says, "What?"
"Don't ask questions,

20:55.908 --> 20:57.334
just do as I say".

20:57.336 --> 20:59.150
And then the guy, you
know, he finds a potato,

20:59.152 --> 21:01.587
puts it in his bathing suit,
goes out on the beach.

21:01.589 --> 21:03.581
He comes back probably 15 minutes later.

21:03.583 --> 21:05.258
And he's-he's livid.

21:05.260 --> 21:07.823
He goes, "You told me to put
a potato in my bathing suit

21:07.825 --> 21:09.169
and the lifeguard kicked me out.

21:09.171 --> 21:11.397
Women were screaming,
children were running from me".

21:12.909 --> 21:14.925
And the guy that told him that says,

21:14.927 --> 21:17.511
"You put the potato in the front".

21:25.104 --> 21:27.955
So what should have made
the man appear well-endowed,

21:27.957 --> 21:31.100
in fact made it look
like he soiled himself.

21:33.429 --> 21:36.356
- Uh, yeah, that's-that's the joke.
- Yeah.
