WEBVTT

00:01.461 --> 00:02.867
Miguel was my boyfriend.

00:02.868 --> 00:05.380
He worked me like a speed bag.
I never pressed charges.

00:05.434 --> 00:06.839
I framed him instead.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.572
Cristina is Miguel's
daughter, isn't she?

00:08.573 --> 00:10.045
I had to keep him away from her.

00:10.046 --> 00:12.168
If you help me find another
way to nail Wozniak,

00:12.169 --> 00:13.377
I won't pursue anything else.

00:13.378 --> 00:15.241
Miguel Zepeda is
not your father.

00:15.242 --> 00:17.334
Someone made a complaint
suggesting I'm no longer

00:17.335 --> 00:19.001
acting in the best
interest of this case.

00:19.002 --> 00:20.505
Tell me this isn't about
getting close to the guy

00:20.506 --> 00:21.781
who can keep your ex put away.

00:21.782 --> 00:23.546
Justice doesn't just happen.
It's made.

00:23.547 --> 00:25.573
Told you, we're off
Zepeda for now.

00:25.574 --> 00:27.141
If you don't cut a deal
for Miguel Zepeda,

00:27.142 --> 00:28.973
this is going to land
right back on your desk.

00:28.974 --> 00:31.229
You've been exonerated.
You're free tonight.

00:31.229 --> 00:33.845
You're about to move a
lot of illegal cash.

00:33.846 --> 00:34.989
I won't be there.

00:34.990 --> 00:36.134
You have to handle
this one alone.

00:36.135 --> 00:37.637
We were supposed to
have a face-to-face.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.272
I got paid to deliver a car.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.614
- Who is he?
- I told you.

00:40.615 --> 00:41.888
I got paid to drive. I don't...

00:41.889 --> 00:44.176
The kid? That man's your
responsibility now.

00:44.176 --> 00:46.138
- He's off my boat.
- Done.

00:46.139 --> 00:48.494
We need this
conversation, Harlee.

00:53.527 --> 00:55.556
Tomorrow, I want a face-to-face,

00:55.557 --> 00:57.027
and every last detail

00:57.027 --> 00:59.575
of this mess you pulled me into.

00:59.576 --> 01:02.845
- I'm done being played.
- Nobody is trying to play you.

01:02.846 --> 01:04.349
I would never risk what we have.

01:04.351 --> 01:05.658
Not for anything,
and you know that.

01:05.659 --> 01:06.866
You know how I feel about you.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.240
Don't do that.

01:08.241 --> 01:10.072
This has nothing to do with us.

01:10.072 --> 01:12.687
The whole thing is about us.
It's about our future.

01:12.688 --> 01:14.290
I want to be with you, Matt.

01:14.291 --> 01:16.152
Oh, what?

01:16.153 --> 01:18.343
I don't like being lied to.

01:18.344 --> 01:20.338
Do you?

01:24.654 --> 01:27.236
I... It doesn't make sense.

01:27.237 --> 01:28.870
I mean, I know he loves Linda.

01:30.212 --> 01:32.402
We are who we pretend to be.

01:32.403 --> 01:35.213
I agreed to take him down.

01:35.214 --> 01:36.717
I didn't agree to
destroy his family.

01:36.718 --> 01:38.385
You're not doing any
of this, Harlee.

01:38.386 --> 01:41.362
He's already done it to himself.

01:42.571 --> 01:44.531
Hey.

01:44.532 --> 01:45.938
You need to get in
on this meeting

01:45.939 --> 01:47.473
that Wozniak's demanding.

01:47.474 --> 01:49.109
That kidnapped man's
life is at stake now,

01:49.109 --> 01:52.084
not just yours.

01:57.840 --> 02:00.911
Hey. Where you been?

02:00.912 --> 02:02.089
Fresh air.

02:02.090 --> 02:03.526
In Brooklyn?

02:03.527 --> 02:04.574
I didn't say I found any.

02:04.575 --> 02:06.111
Come on. You're coming with me.

02:06.112 --> 02:08.530
No, I... I should visit
our friend at the boat.

02:08.531 --> 02:10.786
No, Donnie's having that poor
kidnapped bastard moved.

02:10.787 --> 02:12.552
We've got some
neighborhood protection.

02:12.553 --> 02:14.023
The laundromat on 12th street,

02:14.024 --> 02:16.116
they want us to give a
homeless guy the boot.

02:16.117 --> 02:17.292
No, the last time
that lady called

02:17.292 --> 02:18.502
the guy wasn't even homeless.

02:18.503 --> 02:21.280
Come on. She pays, we play.

02:25.794 --> 02:28.670
You're awfully quiet.

02:28.671 --> 02:29.815
What did Donnie say?

02:29.816 --> 02:32.430
Whatever he's been told to say.

02:32.431 --> 02:33.802
He's a puppet.

02:33.803 --> 02:36.254
That kidnapping victim
wasn't just leverage

02:36.255 --> 02:37.693
for an armored car heist.

02:37.694 --> 02:39.623
That was a test.

02:39.624 --> 02:41.454
Donnie's new daddy wanted to see

02:41.455 --> 02:43.676
if we can get our hands dirty.

02:43.677 --> 02:45.573
Guess we passed. What now?

02:45.573 --> 02:48.418
Nothing until I know
what this job is.

02:48.419 --> 02:50.871
I mean, it's got to
be easy in, easy out,

02:50.872 --> 02:52.438
just like they promised.

02:52.439 --> 02:55.742
Or else we're not doing it.

03:03.980 --> 03:06.661
Told you I couldn't
confirm the target!

03:06.662 --> 03:07.740
How much does this lady pay us?

03:07.741 --> 03:09.963
Not enough to risk death by mop.

03:09.964 --> 03:12.220
Dispatch, requesting
backup for a 10-50,

03:12.221 --> 03:14.247
possibly a mental,
at 82412th Avenue.

03:14.248 --> 03:16.730
I said stand down, Private!

03:16.731 --> 03:18.464
All right, you stay
left, I'll go right.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.099
How 'bout I go home?

03:20.100 --> 03:21.700
Sir? NYPD.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.892
I need you to put the mop down.

03:23.893 --> 03:25.821
Easy, Marine. Easy.

03:25.822 --> 03:28.797
Hand me that weapon, son.

03:30.628 --> 03:33.079
How'd it go down last night?

03:33.080 --> 03:35.695
Two men showed up at the
marina around 7 p.m.

03:35.696 --> 03:38.113
Brought dinner.

03:38.114 --> 03:39.259
Sat with the kidnapped man

03:39.260 --> 03:40.795
on Wozniak's boat for
most of the night.

03:40.796 --> 03:42.104
Same guys that dropped him off.

03:42.105 --> 03:43.312
The armored truck drivers.

03:43.313 --> 03:44.948
We identified the
Caucasian suspect

03:44.949 --> 03:46.516
as Joaquin Foster.

03:46.517 --> 03:48.676
4:00 a.m. they pulled him
out, put him in the trunk,

03:48.677 --> 03:50.798
brought him here
to this warehouse.

03:50.799 --> 03:52.205
Joaquin left a few
minutes later.

03:52.206 --> 03:54.853
Nobody's been in or out since.

03:54.854 --> 03:56.357
You think this is
going down soon?

03:56.358 --> 03:57.664
This heist?

03:57.665 --> 03:58.810
I don't think you
kidnap somebody

03:58.811 --> 04:01.165
until you're ready to use 'em.

04:05.611 --> 04:06.755
Wozniak wants your help

04:06.756 --> 04:08.945
with the fluff 'n' fold killer.

04:08.946 --> 04:11.005
Thought the laundromat
owner dropped the charges.

04:11.006 --> 04:13.818
She did... Woz put him
in the cage to dry out.

04:13.819 --> 04:16.039
Came in this morning and
he was crying like a baby.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.315
Thinks he hurt somebody.

04:17.315 --> 04:20.060
Ugh, I can't imagine
being a soldier.

04:20.062 --> 04:23.428
No, he thinks he hurt
somebody last night.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.326
Look, son, I can't help you

04:25.327 --> 04:26.766
if you won't talk to me.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.333
Why would you help me anyway?

04:28.334 --> 04:30.294
Because I'm a Marine too.

04:30.295 --> 04:32.650
And another time, another place,

04:32.651 --> 04:36.081
we would've had to
rely on one another.

04:36.082 --> 04:37.521
You were beating on
a washing machine,

04:37.522 --> 04:38.860
not a person.

04:38.861 --> 04:41.346
We spoke to the owner. She's
dropping the charges.

04:41.347 --> 04:44.615
I know guys have trouble
separating reality from...

04:44.616 --> 04:47.361
These aren't my shoes.

04:47.362 --> 04:50.304
I had on boots last
night before I left.

04:50.305 --> 04:52.430
You remember changing them?

04:52.431 --> 04:55.111
I don't remember
much of anything.

04:55.112 --> 04:57.694
I, um...

04:57.695 --> 05:00.210
I get violent when I black out.

05:00.211 --> 05:02.205
I've always been afraid

05:02.206 --> 05:05.541
that I'd hurt somebody
and take something.

05:05.542 --> 05:07.209
See if anybody called in

05:07.210 --> 05:08.777
a missing pair of Florsheims

05:08.778 --> 05:10.771
and a mugging.

05:12.930 --> 05:15.350
Looks like our Shoeless Joe
is a shoeless John Doe.

05:15.351 --> 05:16.722
Damn it.

05:16.723 --> 05:19.828
Detective Cates. 34th Precinct.

05:19.829 --> 05:21.954
Dead guy here owns the building.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.751
Guy who runs the bodega,
he called it in.

05:23.752 --> 05:24.895
His wallet's still on him.

05:24.896 --> 05:26.202
His car's still on the street.

05:26.203 --> 05:27.348
Tell you the truth,
I seen bangers

05:27.349 --> 05:28.492
kill each other over some shoes,

05:28.493 --> 05:31.368
but old rich white guys?

05:31.369 --> 05:33.036
Yeah, that's a first.

05:33.037 --> 05:36.013
You've got my
killer, Detectives?

05:37.745 --> 05:40.067
Has anyone seen
Detective Santos?

05:40.068 --> 05:42.682
She's out catching bad guys.

05:42.683 --> 05:44.316
I'm serious. I need
to speak with her.

05:44.317 --> 05:46.081
Well, she's chasing a lead.
I can call her for you.

05:46.082 --> 05:47.160
I got to do this in person.

05:47.161 --> 05:48.598
She gets that a lot.

05:48.599 --> 05:50.528
You could also just wait.

05:50.529 --> 05:53.603
No, I can't.

05:55.367 --> 05:58.179
Matt Wozniak and his
closeted gay lover

05:58.180 --> 06:01.056
from I.A.D. plan an
armored car heist?

06:01.057 --> 06:02.691
Movie rights should be
worth more than the haul.

06:02.692 --> 06:04.620
How did she get
this information?

06:04.621 --> 06:05.830
Walked right in
the middle of it,

06:05.831 --> 06:07.301
threw her wire in the trash.

06:07.302 --> 06:08.446
If you didn't have this on tape,

06:08.447 --> 06:09.917
I wouldn't believe it.

06:09.918 --> 06:12.204
Baker, I'm requesting a
team for the takedown.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.670
You'll have the full
resources of the bureau.

06:15.671 --> 06:18.090
I want Wozniak, his crew,

06:18.091 --> 06:20.607
Donnie Pomp, the
armored car drivers,

06:20.608 --> 06:22.962
and whoever else they've
partnered up with.

06:22.963 --> 06:24.564
Cash in hand.

06:24.564 --> 06:26.689
Course.

06:26.690 --> 06:28.879
Stahl,

06:28.880 --> 06:32.934
I didn't see this
investigation going so far.

06:32.935 --> 06:34.177
Next time I swing
for the fences,

06:34.178 --> 06:37.609
I'll be sure to point first.

06:41.501 --> 06:42.774
Here you go.

06:42.775 --> 06:45.358
Thanks, Steve.

06:45.359 --> 06:47.320
Looks like my lucky day.

06:47.321 --> 06:48.889
We'll fill out chain of custody.

06:48.890 --> 06:50.884
You guys got the
arrest paperwork?

06:50.885 --> 06:53.468
There's no arrest.
We let him dry out.

06:53.469 --> 06:55.885
Look, I know this looks bad,

06:55.886 --> 06:57.815
but it could've
happened a lot of ways.

06:57.816 --> 06:59.483
The way I see it,
it's a violent drunk,

06:59.484 --> 07:02.261
wearing a dead guy's shoes,
who's all but confessing.

07:02.262 --> 07:05.466
Why would a blackout drunk
move a body into a Dumpster?

07:05.467 --> 07:06.642
I don't know, same reason why

07:06.643 --> 07:08.211
he's wailing on somebody's
washing machine.

07:08.212 --> 07:09.847
His knuckles aren't bruised

07:09.848 --> 07:12.332
and he has no visible blood
on his shirt or his hands.

07:12.333 --> 07:13.442
You know, two blocks
south from here,

07:13.443 --> 07:15.275
this would have been your
problem, Detectives,

07:15.276 --> 07:16.975
but in landed in my precinct.

07:16.976 --> 07:20.049
Guess it's your lucky day too.

07:21.977 --> 07:23.872
I know, but you heard him.

07:23.873 --> 07:25.278
Not our jurisdiction.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.077
Doesn't mean we
can't poke around.

07:27.078 --> 07:29.332
Marines don't leave men behind.

07:29.333 --> 07:31.328
I'm gonna take Tufo and Loman.

07:33.813 --> 07:35.838
I'll take that.

07:35.839 --> 07:37.899
Come on. I'll walk him out.

07:37.900 --> 07:39.272
The way I was acting last night,

07:39.273 --> 07:40.874
you could have done
a lot worse to me.

07:40.875 --> 07:43.490
Probably should have. Thank you.

07:43.491 --> 07:45.812
You seem more and more sure
that you killed that man.

07:45.813 --> 07:47.021
I've been to war.

07:47.022 --> 07:49.344
We're all capable of
just about anything.

07:50.912 --> 07:54.541
Appreciate your help, Detective.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:09.249 --> 09:11.603
This is the
Brooklyn-bound F train.

09:11.604 --> 09:13.531
The next stop is...

09:15.004 --> 09:16.605
Saved message:

09:16.606 --> 09:18.240
It's Nava. Call me when you can.

09:18.241 --> 09:19.941
A deal got cut.

09:19.941 --> 09:22.915
I'm sorry, Harlee. Miguel's out.

09:37.599 --> 09:39.789
- I'll catch up.
- Okay.

09:39.789 --> 09:41.652
Agent Stahl.

09:41.653 --> 09:44.165
I hope I'm not stepping
on your feet again.

09:44.189 --> 09:45.660
Well, actually, I was hoping

09:45.661 --> 09:47.229
you could retrace your steps

09:47.229 --> 09:48.732
with Lieutenant Wozniak.

09:48.733 --> 09:49.910
I got the impression
you were close

09:49.911 --> 09:51.119
to landing him for something.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.592
I can't officially say anything

09:52.593 --> 09:54.095
about the investigation because

09:54.096 --> 09:55.372
there is no investigation.

09:55.373 --> 09:58.509
Unofficially, they...
they pulled your case?

09:58.510 --> 10:01.288
The Special Agent in Charge
let me follow up on a hunch

10:01.289 --> 10:02.630
based on pattern behavior.

10:02.630 --> 10:05.374
Detective Saperstein was
unable to back up that hunch

10:05.375 --> 10:07.989
before he took flight.

10:07.990 --> 10:11.357
That's a good story.
Why tell it to me?

10:14.302 --> 10:17.374
Come on, baby. Pick up.

10:17.375 --> 10:20.774
Pick up. Pick up.

10:20.775 --> 10:22.147
Hey, what's with all the calls?

10:22.148 --> 10:23.487
What's with you not picking up?

10:23.488 --> 10:24.894
Uh, it's called school?

10:24.895 --> 10:27.543
They make you sit in class and
learn without your phone?

10:27.544 --> 10:30.026
Well, you have permission now.
I called the school.

10:30.027 --> 10:31.302
What? What's wrong?

10:31.303 --> 10:33.492
Look, I don't want to scare you.

10:33.493 --> 10:35.976
But the guy who thinks he's
your father, Miguel Zepeda?

10:35.977 --> 10:38.755
- He got out of jail.
- He escaped?

10:38.756 --> 10:41.176
No, I think they let him out.

10:41.177 --> 10:42.483
So he's innocent?

10:42.484 --> 10:44.314
Cristina, I just want
you to promise me

10:44.315 --> 10:46.505
that if you see him,
you'll let me know.

10:46.506 --> 10:48.499
I'm going to text you a picture.

10:48.500 --> 10:49.841
Mom, you're scaring me.

10:49.842 --> 10:53.633
No, I just... I just don't
want him bothering you.

10:53.634 --> 10:55.823
Promise you'll tell me.

10:55.824 --> 10:57.293
Yeah. Okay.

10:57.294 --> 10:58.766
Drive straight
home after school.

10:58.767 --> 11:00.072
I'll pop by and we'll talk more.

11:02.199 --> 11:03.834
I love you, baby.

11:03.835 --> 11:06.907
Okay, love you too.

11:17.664 --> 11:20.344
Miguel.

11:20.345 --> 11:21.620
Hi.

11:21.621 --> 11:22.894
You're out.

11:22.895 --> 11:24.561
Yeah.

11:24.562 --> 11:27.374
Prosecution called my lawyer.
They cut a deal.

11:27.374 --> 11:28.517
She thinks they
uncovered something

11:28.518 --> 11:31.657
they didn't want people
to hear in court.

11:32.606 --> 11:35.352
How'd you know?

11:35.353 --> 11:37.183
I saw you at the precinct.

11:37.184 --> 11:40.125
I thought you saw me too.

11:40.126 --> 11:43.624
I just figured you were
staying at your mom's.

11:43.625 --> 11:47.186
Uh, I wanted to ask you...

11:47.187 --> 11:49.900
for permission to see Cristina.

11:49.901 --> 11:51.044
Then why didn't you?

11:51.045 --> 11:53.366
I saw that detective
that put me away.

11:53.367 --> 11:55.883
Wozniak.

11:55.884 --> 11:59.742
How long have you two
been working together?

11:59.743 --> 12:01.932
I don't.

12:01.933 --> 12:04.678
I mean, same precinct,
but he's an ass.

12:04.679 --> 12:07.230
I keep my distance.

12:07.231 --> 12:10.303
So, um...

12:10.304 --> 12:11.871
About Cristina...

12:11.872 --> 12:13.670
Yeah, about that, um,

12:13.671 --> 12:16.351
Cristina saw some old
evidence photos.

12:16.352 --> 12:18.575
What kind of evidence?

12:18.576 --> 12:20.863
The black and blue kind.

12:20.864 --> 12:23.674
Miguel, it's... it's
been ten years.

12:23.675 --> 12:25.014
You told me that you changed,

12:25.015 --> 12:27.402
and I sense a difference in you.

12:27.403 --> 12:30.475
Find a place. Get a job.

12:30.476 --> 12:33.910
Work at being someone
she can respect.

12:34.857 --> 12:37.833
Then we'll talk. Okay?

12:40.580 --> 12:43.553
Ten years, Harlee.

12:48.425 --> 12:51.170
What's a little
while longer, huh?

12:51.171 --> 12:54.702
Thank you.

12:54.703 --> 12:58.104
I'll be in touch.

13:00.032 --> 13:02.156
The guy that you found in
the Dumpster this morning.

13:02.157 --> 13:04.151
- Did you know him?
- I see him.

13:04.152 --> 13:06.277
He buys coffee. I told
this to the other police.

13:06.278 --> 13:07.747
We're just following up.

13:07.748 --> 13:09.283
Nothing else funky last night?

13:09.284 --> 13:10.723
There's a pervert
club on the corner.

13:10.724 --> 13:12.260
I see funky every evening.

13:12.261 --> 13:15.725
We appreciate your time.
Thank you.

13:15.725 --> 13:17.328
You don't want his
security footage?

13:17.329 --> 13:19.582
No... we start
confiscating footage,

13:19.583 --> 13:20.727
the other detectives are gonna

13:20.728 --> 13:22.427
get their panties in a bunch.

13:22.428 --> 13:23.571
If you don't mind me asking,

13:23.572 --> 13:25.108
why are we looking to
clear this Marine anyway?

13:25.109 --> 13:27.136
Because half of him is
still in the desert,

13:27.137 --> 13:29.130
and the other half deserves
the benefit of the doubt.

13:29.131 --> 13:30.438
Spoke to everyone
on the other side.

13:30.439 --> 13:32.823
Nobody saw anything.

13:32.824 --> 13:35.277
You talked to everyone
on the other side?

13:35.278 --> 13:39.004
What about James Brown there?

13:39.005 --> 13:40.150
- Do I have to?
- Yeah.

13:40.150 --> 13:41.456
He could have seen it.
He's got eyes.

13:41.457 --> 13:43.941
- Go ask him. Come on.
- Yes, sir.

13:48.583 --> 13:50.643
"I'm sorry, he's out"?

13:50.644 --> 13:52.147
Are you serious?

13:52.148 --> 13:53.324
I leave more concerned messages

13:53.325 --> 13:54.699
when my neighbor's dog gets out.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.626
Harlee, this is my
colleague, Andrea.

13:56.627 --> 13:57.771
Yeah, she know what
a self-righteous

13:57.772 --> 13:59.177
son of a bitch you are?

13:59.178 --> 14:00.485
- I'll go.
- Yeah.

14:00.486 --> 14:01.695
Yeah, you might want
to go out backwards.

14:01.696 --> 14:02.708
He's good with a knife.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.505
- I had nothing to do with this.
- No?

14:04.506 --> 14:05.847
Because last I
heard, you felt bad

14:05.848 --> 14:07.153
because some ethics committee

14:07.154 --> 14:08.494
slapped your hand
for screwing me.

14:08.495 --> 14:09.900
So you think I what?

14:09.901 --> 14:11.044
Let a murderer out of jail?

14:11.045 --> 14:13.432
The guy who beat the
hell out of you?

14:13.433 --> 14:15.001
I recused myself, yes,

14:15.002 --> 14:17.125
in part to protect this case.

14:17.126 --> 14:18.629
If the defense got wind
of our relationship,

14:18.630 --> 14:20.427
they could have used it
to angle for his release.

14:20.428 --> 14:21.605
Maybe that's what happened.

14:21.606 --> 14:22.651
You're telling me
you don't know?

14:22.652 --> 14:23.764
Yeah, that's what
"recuse" means.

14:23.764 --> 14:25.234
A decision got made
behind closed doors

14:25.235 --> 14:27.883
and I wasn't a part of it.

14:31.775 --> 14:33.081
I want a restraining order.

14:33.082 --> 14:34.584
Nobody's gonna grant you
a restraining order

14:34.585 --> 14:35.958
when he hasn't done anything.

14:35.959 --> 14:38.607
Miguel plays normal, but
he's cruel and dangerous.

14:38.608 --> 14:39.915
He was spying on me

14:39.916 --> 14:41.419
within hours of his release.

14:41.420 --> 14:44.067
Whoa. You spoke to him?

14:44.068 --> 14:47.925
He wants to see Cristina.

14:47.926 --> 14:49.395
I told him that it was
gonna take a minute

14:49.396 --> 14:51.260
so you'd have time
to go to a judge.

14:51.261 --> 14:53.026
And I'm telling you a
judge isn't gonna issue

14:53.027 --> 14:54.335
a restraining order
because a man asked

14:54.336 --> 14:57.374
to see his daughter.

14:57.375 --> 15:00.187
Maybe I can help
in some other way.

15:01.135 --> 15:04.012
So far you're 0-2.

15:06.921 --> 15:08.228
Hey.

15:08.229 --> 15:09.699
I heard you picked
up a homicidal vet

15:09.700 --> 15:11.824
at a laundromat.

15:11.825 --> 15:13.721
I live down the block, the whole
neighborhood was talking...

15:13.722 --> 15:16.107
The whole neighborhood's a pain
in the ass, thanks to you.

15:16.108 --> 15:17.612
Well, protection money's
protection money.

15:17.613 --> 15:19.181
I thought I was
doing you a favor.

15:19.182 --> 15:20.652
This vet: what are Detectives

15:20.653 --> 15:23.497
Cates and Broyhill
doing with him?

15:23.498 --> 15:24.641
They want him for a murder

15:24.642 --> 15:26.243
that happened a few blocks over.

15:26.244 --> 15:28.532
He was wearing the
dead man's shoes.

15:28.533 --> 15:30.986
Is that what you're
here to find out?

15:30.987 --> 15:33.371
No.

15:33.372 --> 15:35.986
I got another visit from
Special Agent Stahl.

15:35.987 --> 15:38.634
You know, the Fed who
warned me off your crew.

15:38.635 --> 15:41.380
He wanted to pass the baton.

15:41.381 --> 15:42.917
Now, he wants you for
Saperstein's murder,

15:42.918 --> 15:45.238
but that ain't federal.

15:45.239 --> 15:46.873
This is good news.

15:46.874 --> 15:48.540
They're pulling up stakes, Woz.

15:48.541 --> 15:50.633
Saperstein was the only leak.

15:50.634 --> 15:53.249
Rest of my crew is clean.

15:53.250 --> 15:54.852
And it also means

15:54.852 --> 15:56.813
we're free and clear
to do the job.

15:56.814 --> 15:59.329
I haven't committed to that.

15:59.330 --> 16:01.489
I'm not even sure
what this job is.

16:01.490 --> 16:04.267
You will be.

16:04.268 --> 16:05.836
I got you your face-to-face.

16:05.837 --> 16:07.897
For real this time. 2:00.

16:07.898 --> 16:10.872
You get all the details.

16:12.377 --> 16:15.058
Buckle up. You're
about to be rich.

16:25.836 --> 16:29.171
What? Said he saw the murder.

16:29.171 --> 16:30.870
We had a deal, Moses.

16:30.871 --> 16:33.388
And right now, you're
eating my end of it.

16:33.389 --> 16:35.513
Yo, I think we just
got bamboozled.

16:38.096 --> 16:40.091
Moses get a burger!

16:40.091 --> 16:41.234
Moses gets a burger!

16:41.235 --> 16:43.326
Moses doesn't get dick

16:43.326 --> 16:46.956
until Moses tells me
what he saw last night.

16:50.977 --> 16:53.527
Who... killed...

16:53.528 --> 16:55.751
the old man?

17:01.603 --> 17:03.499
It were the devil!

17:03.500 --> 17:05.265
And this helps us somehow?

17:05.266 --> 17:07.226
Moses, tell her the
rest of the story.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.612
About Father Time
and the Dumpster.

17:09.613 --> 17:11.868
Devil grab up Father Time,

17:11.869 --> 17:14.386
shake him real good.

17:14.387 --> 17:17.262
Father Time, he... he...
he... he call out,

17:17.263 --> 17:19.814
"Help a body! Help!"

17:19.815 --> 17:22.169
Devil take a whackin' stick,

17:22.169 --> 17:25.928
and crack Father Time
upside the head.

17:25.929 --> 17:28.054
Down he goes.

17:28.055 --> 17:31.453
Devil pick him up.

17:31.454 --> 17:34.363
Put him in a trash bucket.

17:34.364 --> 17:35.802
I don't suppose you saw

17:35.803 --> 17:39.203
what the devil did with
the whacking stick?

17:39.204 --> 17:40.870
Moses didn't see that.

17:40.871 --> 17:43.487
Did the devil take
Father Time's shoes?

17:43.488 --> 17:47.049
Moses didn't see that, either.

17:47.050 --> 17:50.483
Did Moses see where
the devil went?

17:52.412 --> 17:53.751
Can I talk to you?

17:53.752 --> 17:55.681
I have something
important to tell you.

17:55.682 --> 17:59.017
Devil always scare Moses.

18:00.945 --> 18:04.411
You seen the devil before?

18:05.359 --> 18:07.123
Moses get a burger?

18:07.124 --> 18:09.020
Moses get a whacking stick.

18:09.021 --> 18:11.047
Yes, you'll get a burger.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.550
Come on.

18:12.551 --> 18:16.442
Moses, where did
you see the devil?

18:16.442 --> 18:19.188
City bus.

18:19.189 --> 18:21.247
B-1-2.

18:21.248 --> 18:23.831
Every day.

18:23.832 --> 18:25.596
Waitin'.

18:25.597 --> 18:27.166
Watchin'.

18:27.167 --> 18:30.599
Waiting and watching for what?

18:30.600 --> 18:33.770
For what devil do.

18:33.771 --> 18:36.614
Lure you in.

18:36.615 --> 18:39.787
And steal a body's soul.

18:43.971 --> 18:45.900
Couldn't leave well
enough alone, could you?

18:45.901 --> 18:47.339
I'm gonna need some context.

18:47.340 --> 18:49.332
Well, contextualize this:

18:49.333 --> 18:51.555
Miguel Zepeda was released
after prosecution,

18:51.556 --> 18:54.107
unsolicited, offered him a deal.

18:54.108 --> 18:55.250
I don't know
anything about that.

18:55.251 --> 18:57.342
Don't you ever lie to me.

18:57.343 --> 18:59.337
You and I are the only ones
with enough information

18:59.338 --> 19:01.202
damning enough to make
something like that happen.

19:01.203 --> 19:03.065
I'm not comfortable
playing fast and loose

19:03.066 --> 19:04.208
with an innocent man's life.

19:04.209 --> 19:07.053
Damn it, Molly.

19:09.277 --> 19:11.107
I had every intention
of exposing

19:11.108 --> 19:13.036
what Wozniak had done to Miguel,

19:13.037 --> 19:16.110
after we make the bust.

19:16.111 --> 19:17.549
If your tip had led
to him being dragged

19:17.550 --> 19:18.857
to some habeas hearing,
you know how...

19:18.858 --> 19:20.786
I made sure it didn't, so
the outcome is the same.

19:20.787 --> 19:22.223
No. It's not.

19:22.224 --> 19:25.853
This outcome means
I can't trust you.

19:25.853 --> 19:27.881
What we have here is a case,

19:27.882 --> 19:30.005
not a foregone conclusion.

19:30.006 --> 19:31.641
And you did what?

19:31.642 --> 19:33.668
Made some veiled threat
to the D.A.'s office?

19:33.669 --> 19:35.663
You don't get to
play judge and jury.

19:35.664 --> 19:37.525
That man spent a
decade in prison

19:37.526 --> 19:38.833
for a crime he didn't commit.

19:38.834 --> 19:40.011
Now, he's out where he belongs,

19:40.012 --> 19:41.154
and don't think it
isn't lost on me

19:41.155 --> 19:42.724
that you suddenly
backed off pursuing him

19:42.725 --> 19:45.240
after a long chat
with our asset.

19:54.724 --> 19:56.489
You're back on duty.

19:56.490 --> 19:57.928
Continue the stakeout.

19:57.929 --> 20:01.491
Let me know if that
kidnapped man moves.

20:02.799 --> 20:05.904
Nava doesn't know what
the prosecution has?

20:05.905 --> 20:07.440
Maybe it's just about
our relationship.

20:07.441 --> 20:08.618
We dodged a bullet.

20:08.619 --> 20:10.449
If they're making a deal,

20:10.450 --> 20:12.443
they want the rumor to die.

20:12.444 --> 20:14.830
Miguel on the streets is
not dodging a bullet.

20:14.831 --> 20:16.399
You know what I'm saying.

20:16.400 --> 20:17.741
His attorney already
has him wondering

20:17.741 --> 20:19.736
if the prosecution
uncovered corruption.

20:19.737 --> 20:23.364
He was asking if you
and I work together.

20:24.509 --> 20:27.123
If he figures out
that we framed him...

20:27.124 --> 20:29.837
Then we'll figure out
something first.

20:29.838 --> 20:32.028
Like what?

20:32.029 --> 20:34.023
His case is already suspicious.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.952
We can't risk going after him.
Not with the Feds.

20:35.953 --> 20:38.698
Nah, I think that
might be behind us.

20:38.699 --> 20:41.673
Saperstein's handler
approached Donnie.

20:41.674 --> 20:42.916
He wants him to pursue us

20:42.917 --> 20:46.283
because the FBI case got killed.

20:46.284 --> 20:49.355
Does that mean we're moving
forward with Donnie?

20:49.356 --> 20:51.351
I don't know.

20:51.352 --> 20:54.293
We were just supposed to
move some fat cat's cash.

20:54.294 --> 20:56.419
Tax evasion, not explosives.

20:56.420 --> 20:58.577
And a kidnapped guy? No!

20:58.578 --> 21:01.651
No.

21:05.541 --> 21:08.091
Eh, big enough chunk of change,

21:08.092 --> 21:10.869
I could pay Miguel to go away.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.439
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.

21:12.440 --> 21:13.747
That kind of payday could make

21:13.748 --> 21:16.885
such a big difference
for all of us.

21:16.886 --> 21:19.664
Well, it still could.

21:19.665 --> 21:22.606
No Miguel, no Feds.

21:22.607 --> 21:26.235
We could just start over.

21:26.236 --> 21:29.897
Yeah, maybe.

21:29.898 --> 21:32.513
Uh, so put Tess and Espada

21:32.514 --> 21:35.063
on the bus with Moses.

21:35.064 --> 21:36.274
You're kidding, right?

21:36.275 --> 21:38.562
Woz, that guy is bats.

21:38.563 --> 21:40.785
It's the only lead we
have to help my Marine.

21:40.786 --> 21:43.140
Just humor him.

21:43.141 --> 21:45.330
Okay?

21:45.331 --> 21:48.013
I want this devil.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.778
You told them, didn't you?

22:05.779 --> 22:08.461
About my affair with Nava?

22:08.461 --> 22:09.799
That Miguel was innocent?

22:09.800 --> 22:11.957
I keep my promises, Harlee.

22:11.958 --> 22:13.265
So your partner, then?

22:13.266 --> 22:14.442
She is scared of her own shadow.

22:14.443 --> 22:15.488
She wouldn't do that.

22:15.489 --> 22:16.600
She doesn't have
enough information

22:16.601 --> 22:18.105
to make something
like that happen.

22:18.106 --> 22:21.375
So the prosecution
just let him out?

22:21.376 --> 22:24.088
Last we argued, your boyfriend
played for that team.

22:24.089 --> 22:26.965
We've argued since then,
and he's not my boyfriend.

22:26.966 --> 22:28.991
He didn't do this.

22:28.992 --> 22:31.477
Well, whoever did it,

22:31.478 --> 22:32.785
the point is, it's done,

22:32.786 --> 22:34.781
and it wasn't done by me.

22:40.207 --> 22:41.972
I can't assign an
agent to him, Harlee,

22:41.973 --> 22:45.471
but I could check up
on him now and then.

22:46.486 --> 22:48.611
Thanks.

22:50.180 --> 22:51.812
What's the status on
this face-to-face

22:51.813 --> 22:53.219
Wozniak asked Donnie for?

22:53.220 --> 22:55.051
This, uh... the shot-caller.

22:55.052 --> 22:56.750
He hasn't had it yet.

22:56.751 --> 22:59.790
But I pushed him to
stay in when it does.

22:59.791 --> 23:01.686
I should get back to the
precinct in case it happens.

23:01.687 --> 23:02.962
Wear the wire.

23:02.963 --> 23:04.760
Call me if you think we
need to be listening.

23:04.761 --> 23:05.905
I can't.

23:05.906 --> 23:06.919
I threw it in the
trash so we could

23:06.920 --> 23:08.846
overhear Donnie last night.

23:08.847 --> 23:10.089
Look, if I go to
your place later,

23:10.090 --> 23:12.281
can you get a new one?

23:12.282 --> 23:13.687
My place?

23:13.688 --> 23:15.419
Wherever. This makes me nervous.

23:15.420 --> 23:17.740
Okay. My place is fine.

23:17.741 --> 23:19.245
If the meet happens before that,

23:19.246 --> 23:21.763
you have to call me.

23:29.151 --> 23:31.669
- Yeah.
- You alone?

23:32.683 --> 23:34.022
Yeah, why?

23:34.023 --> 23:35.395
I'm texting you an address.

23:35.396 --> 23:37.226
Call me when you get there.

23:37.227 --> 23:40.757
And Harlee, make sure
that nobody follows you.

23:43.210 --> 23:45.203
I'll be there.

23:47.657 --> 23:50.271
Hey. Hey!

23:50.272 --> 23:51.383
How you gonna spot this devil

23:51.384 --> 23:53.641
if you don't look
up from your food?

23:53.642 --> 23:56.254
Got to go to get to!

23:56.255 --> 23:57.400
Yeah, Espada.

23:57.401 --> 23:59.393
- Got to go to get to.
- Hmm.

23:59.394 --> 24:01.845
Boss's wild goose chase express.

24:03.253 --> 24:04.755
Devil!

24:04.756 --> 24:06.782
Devil! Hey, police!

24:06.783 --> 24:09.268
Police, stop the bus!

24:14.140 --> 24:15.774
Moses, what am I looking at?

24:15.775 --> 24:18.292
Devil!

24:18.293 --> 24:20.906
- Devil!
- Son of a bitch.

24:20.907 --> 24:23.883
It really is the devil.

24:25.125 --> 24:26.661
What do you got?

24:26.662 --> 24:29.146
Sexy devil's name is Royce,
and he ain't just a model.

24:29.147 --> 24:30.258
- Whoa!
- Yeah.

24:30.259 --> 24:32.317
Owns the Kink Club and
the building it's in.

24:32.318 --> 24:34.476
A block away from where
our body was found.

24:34.477 --> 24:35.978
Dead guys owns the
building next door.

24:35.979 --> 24:37.680
Club had a slew of noise
violation complaints,

24:37.681 --> 24:39.903
all initiated by the old
guy in the Dumpster.

24:39.904 --> 24:41.046
And maybe Royce had enough,

24:41.047 --> 24:42.421
confrontation got physical,

24:42.422 --> 24:43.892
ended up in the trash.

24:43.893 --> 24:45.265
Where your drunk vet finds him,

24:45.266 --> 24:46.442
pilfers his penny loafers.

24:46.443 --> 24:47.913
All right, well that's
enough to pick him up.

24:47.914 --> 24:49.612
We got to hand this over, right?

24:49.613 --> 24:51.018
- The detectives in charge?
- No.

24:51.019 --> 24:52.687
Dead guy is on their
side of the street.

24:52.688 --> 24:53.930
Sex club is on ours.

24:53.931 --> 24:55.595
Their murder, my perp.

24:55.596 --> 24:58.278
Find out when he'll be
there and pick him up.

24:58.279 --> 25:00.077
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

25:05.045 --> 25:08.413
- Nobody see you?
- Nobody who's interested.

25:08.414 --> 25:10.996
Horse stables? Really?

25:10.997 --> 25:12.992
Spare me the "What the hell."

25:12.993 --> 25:14.200
She's here, and she knows

25:14.201 --> 25:15.605
we've been discussing a job.

25:15.606 --> 25:16.914
Then we're not discussing
anything anymore.

25:16.915 --> 25:18.091
This is done.

25:18.092 --> 25:20.804
Maybe, if you were in
charge, but you're not.

25:20.805 --> 25:22.209
You know, if I were you,

25:22.210 --> 25:25.318
I'd be very careful, Matt.

25:26.854 --> 25:29.207
Feed a monster,

25:29.208 --> 25:31.988
better hope he doesn't
get bigger than you.

25:32.934 --> 25:35.353
Ah. You, I recognize.

25:36.432 --> 25:39.702
- Joaquin.
- Just a delivery boy, huh?

25:39.703 --> 25:42.941
You, I don't recognize.

25:45.850 --> 25:48.760
Linklater.

25:49.707 --> 25:50.982
Harlee Santos.

25:50.983 --> 25:52.322
She wasn't supposed to be here.

25:52.323 --> 25:53.892
I can understand
your disappointment.

25:53.893 --> 25:55.035
Donnie does a bang-up job

25:55.036 --> 25:57.193
of leaving information
on the table.

25:57.194 --> 25:59.253
I apologize for that.

25:59.254 --> 26:00.987
Donnie's father and
I grew up together.

26:00.988 --> 26:03.210
Joaquin here is Donnie's nephew,

26:03.211 --> 26:04.844
so I guess you could
say that this is

26:04.845 --> 26:07.067
a bit of a family venture.

26:07.068 --> 26:08.800
Why we had to test
your loyalty, brother.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.468
You talk again, you're
gonna swallow your teeth.

26:10.469 --> 26:12.332
Joaquin.

26:12.333 --> 26:16.157
Lieutenant, I'm risk averse.
You can appreciate that.

26:16.158 --> 26:19.164
To make this job happen,
I wanted police,

26:19.165 --> 26:22.303
'cause nobody's gonna stop
you and check your vehicle.

26:22.304 --> 26:24.723
And if things, God
forbid, go south,

26:24.724 --> 26:26.881
you can claim you're
part of the hunt

26:26.882 --> 26:28.646
instead of the hunted.

26:28.647 --> 26:32.014
Donnie told me we were moving
some jerk-off's money,

26:32.015 --> 26:33.976
not heisting an armored car.

26:33.977 --> 26:36.296
Well, it's not a total lie.

26:36.297 --> 26:37.604
I don't know about
the "jerk-off" part,

26:37.605 --> 26:39.827
but it is my money.

26:39.828 --> 26:42.640
In a manner of speaking.

26:42.641 --> 26:44.568
It belongs to the DEA.

26:44.569 --> 26:48.296
And I'm a DEA agent.

26:48.297 --> 26:49.767
That's why I couldn't
tell you who he was.

26:49.768 --> 26:50.944
And why I would prefer

26:50.945 --> 26:53.168
that if we do move
forward on this,

26:53.169 --> 26:54.801
that the rest of your
crew stay in the dark

26:54.802 --> 26:57.844
on that subject.

26:59.413 --> 27:00.655
You want us to steal money

27:00.656 --> 27:02.288
that belongs to the U.S.
Government?

27:02.289 --> 27:04.055
Cash that's just gonna
be sitting in a bank

27:04.056 --> 27:05.755
until it's trotted
out as evidence.

27:05.756 --> 27:07.750
And after that,
it's budget excess.

27:07.751 --> 27:09.058
Despite how it sounds,

27:09.059 --> 27:10.986
this job is everything
you were promised.

27:10.987 --> 27:12.588
It's simple and safe.

27:12.589 --> 27:14.059
I wouldn't describe

27:14.060 --> 27:16.740
a bag full of plastic
explosives as "safe."

27:16.741 --> 27:20.173
The explosives are a prop. We're
creating a narrative here.

27:20.174 --> 27:23.116
Armored guards just don't
step out of their vehicles.

27:23.117 --> 27:25.013
So, Joaquin is gonna tell 'em

27:25.014 --> 27:26.321
that you threatened to detonate.

27:26.322 --> 27:27.629
Yeah, we were told
the explosives

27:27.630 --> 27:28.772
were for a diversion.

27:28.773 --> 27:30.799
Either way, the
explosives are gone.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.741
Well, we're gonna have
to get you some more.

27:33.742 --> 27:35.736
The DEA makes busts.

27:35.737 --> 27:38.287
Confiscates drugs and cash.

27:38.288 --> 27:40.411
The cash is held in
field office safes.

27:40.412 --> 27:42.209
When the safe gets filled
up, the field office

27:42.210 --> 27:45.119
schedules an armored car pickup.

27:45.120 --> 27:47.474
Tomorrow, we're gonna leverage
the kidnapped man's wife

27:47.475 --> 27:49.763
into scheduling a pickup,
but with our drivers.

27:49.764 --> 27:51.462
Joaquin and his partner
pick up the money,

27:51.463 --> 27:52.999
your vans box 'em in

27:53.000 --> 27:55.777
in a discreet location
in your precinct.

27:55.778 --> 27:56.923
We only have one van.

27:56.924 --> 27:58.066
I'm working on
getting another one.

27:58.067 --> 27:59.768
You split the cash
between the two vans.

27:59.769 --> 28:01.957
That way, one van gets caught?

28:01.958 --> 28:03.102
- We still get a payoff.
- Yeah.

28:03.103 --> 28:05.326
One gets caught, my
crew gets screwed.

28:05.327 --> 28:08.040
Then don't get caught.

28:08.041 --> 28:10.916
You load up the vans,
and before you leave,

28:10.917 --> 28:12.780
you give Joaquin and his
partner some bruises

28:12.781 --> 28:14.154
so they have a story to tell.

28:14.155 --> 28:16.637
Well, that's probably the best
part of your plan so far.

28:16.638 --> 28:18.012
What happens to
the kidnapped guy

28:18.013 --> 28:20.332
once his wife sends Joaquin
to the DEA pickup?

28:20.333 --> 28:22.424
Well, the kidnapped
guy goes home.

28:22.425 --> 28:24.026
Too scared to talk.

28:24.027 --> 28:26.774
We got to him once, he
knows we can do it again.

28:26.775 --> 28:28.734
Woz, the DEA took down

28:28.735 --> 28:31.513
a Haitian stash house last week.

28:31.514 --> 28:34.292
The kitty's up to $12 million.

28:34.293 --> 28:37.203
$12 million?

28:37.204 --> 28:39.328
- What's our take?
- $1 million.

28:39.329 --> 28:40.505
You divide it amongst your crew

28:40.506 --> 28:42.107
however you see fit.

28:42.108 --> 28:43.382
Hey, not bad for an hour's work.

28:43.383 --> 28:45.475
What are you, joking?

28:45.476 --> 28:48.841
You got Tweedle-moron over
here stopping a truck,

28:48.842 --> 28:50.478
you two are waiting
on the sidelines,

28:50.479 --> 28:52.538
and my crew is
taking all the risk.

28:52.539 --> 28:54.727
For 8 1/2%?

28:54.728 --> 28:56.395
What do you propose?

28:56.396 --> 28:58.618
$3 million. Equal shares.

28:58.619 --> 29:00.318
Lieutenant, I don't think you
appreciate how involved...

29:00.319 --> 29:02.444
I don't think you understand.

29:02.445 --> 29:05.679
We might just pull
traffic duty tomorrow.

29:05.680 --> 29:07.053
Could pull anyone over.

29:07.054 --> 29:09.310
Matt.

29:13.200 --> 29:15.162
Equal shares it is.

29:26.918 --> 29:28.029
Hey. You're home early.

29:28.030 --> 29:29.140
Ugh.

29:29.141 --> 29:30.710
I got to go back.

29:30.711 --> 29:33.194
How was your day?

29:33.195 --> 29:34.731
Well, I wasn't
abducted by a convict

29:34.732 --> 29:36.203
who thinks he's my father.

29:36.204 --> 29:38.883
So there's that.

29:38.884 --> 29:41.597
I heard he was getting
out, and I panicked.

29:41.598 --> 29:44.278
I mean, what's he
really gonna do?

29:44.279 --> 29:45.652
He might be wrong
about being my dad,

29:45.653 --> 29:47.876
but his letter was
basically nice.

29:47.877 --> 29:49.510
I just want to protect you.

29:49.511 --> 29:50.915
You know, from the unexpected.

29:50.916 --> 29:54.284
Wow, sometimes the helicopter
flies a little low.

29:56.311 --> 29:59.384
Look, I promise to give
you some real space

29:59.385 --> 30:01.444
and treat you like an adult,

30:01.445 --> 30:04.843
but until I sort things
out with Miguel,

30:04.844 --> 30:06.446
I need you to promise me
that when you're home,

30:06.447 --> 30:08.048
the door stays locked.

30:08.049 --> 30:11.155
When you're on school
property, you stay at school.

30:11.156 --> 30:14.553
And if you see him, you call me.

30:14.554 --> 30:18.153
Just until you sort things out?

30:23.023 --> 30:25.605
Fine.

30:36.853 --> 30:38.716
Look, I know what
you're thinking.

30:38.717 --> 30:40.122
We've already thought it.

30:40.123 --> 30:41.724
We're still thinking it.

30:41.725 --> 30:44.404
"This isn't what we do."

30:44.405 --> 30:46.105
I'm thinking you're nuts.

30:46.106 --> 30:47.348
An armored car?

30:47.349 --> 30:48.787
After what just
happened to Saperstein?

30:48.788 --> 30:50.290
With the Feds on us?

30:50.291 --> 30:51.760
I told you.

30:51.761 --> 30:53.787
We got word that
investigation died with Sap.

30:53.788 --> 30:56.076
It's basically security.

30:56.077 --> 30:58.855
It's not someone's retirement.
It's drug money.

30:58.856 --> 31:01.603
We're out fighting
drug war every day.

31:01.604 --> 31:03.401
Why not profit?

31:03.402 --> 31:04.904
$600,000.

31:04.905 --> 31:08.010
$600,000 for a handful of hours.

31:08.011 --> 31:11.052
Slightly worse broken out
over 10 to 25 years.

31:11.053 --> 31:12.392
In prison.

31:12.393 --> 31:13.666
Look, we'll take a vote.

31:13.667 --> 31:16.708
If it's not unanimous,
then we don't do it.

31:16.709 --> 31:19.488
Honest.

31:22.398 --> 31:24.883
I'm in.

31:27.791 --> 31:30.897
Okay. Yeah.

31:30.898 --> 31:33.413
Espada?

31:33.414 --> 31:35.441
Yeah, if everybody else is in.

31:35.442 --> 31:39.235
Sure. Why not?

31:48.226 --> 31:50.055
Looks like we're doing this.

31:50.056 --> 31:52.344
All right.

31:59.014 --> 32:02.153
Looks like we're
almost back to normal.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.763
...in custody.

32:11.764 --> 32:13.400
I appreciate the update.

32:15.624 --> 32:17.781
- Hello.
- Vote's done.

32:17.782 --> 32:19.352
We're in.

32:19.353 --> 32:21.509
And what about van number two?

32:21.510 --> 32:24.092
Tomorrow morning.
Parking garage on 14th.

32:24.093 --> 32:25.236
Key's on the back tire.

32:25.237 --> 32:26.968
Everything else you
need is on the inside.

32:26.969 --> 32:28.440
Hey, I heard your veteran's

32:28.440 --> 32:30.663
gonna cop to the murder
of that landlord.

32:30.664 --> 32:31.808
Not if I can help it.

32:31.809 --> 32:34.913
Did I mention he was landlord?

32:34.914 --> 32:37.463
You must have.
Something new turn up?

32:51.851 --> 32:54.498
Who is it?

32:54.499 --> 32:57.180
Hello?

33:07.153 --> 33:09.602
Somebody there?

33:24.676 --> 33:28.173
Is this some kind of a jo...

33:28.174 --> 33:30.659
Cristina?

33:30.660 --> 33:32.522
Is that you?

33:32.523 --> 33:34.452
Who are you?

33:34.453 --> 33:36.250
I hoped I'd be
looking at your face

33:36.251 --> 33:39.389
when I said this.

33:42.823 --> 33:46.288
I'm your father.

33:54.518 --> 33:56.707
I don't know if your
mother told you this,

33:56.708 --> 33:58.312
but the courts realized
that I didn't do

33:58.312 --> 34:00.828
what they said I did.

34:00.829 --> 34:03.543
So they let me go.

34:04.491 --> 34:07.300
I know I shouldn't be here.

34:07.301 --> 34:10.080
I know that,

34:10.081 --> 34:13.351
but I just couldn't
wait to meet you.

34:14.462 --> 34:15.801
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

34:15.802 --> 34:18.712
Cristina, I'm not a bad guy.

34:19.790 --> 34:21.851
- I'm not.
- Look, I'm calling my mom.

34:21.851 --> 34:23.844
Wait. Please. Don't.

34:23.844 --> 34:26.166
I don't want her to get mad

34:26.167 --> 34:28.161
and I don't want her to worry.

34:30.121 --> 34:33.621
I'm leaving now.

34:33.621 --> 34:36.565
Okay? I'm leaving.

34:49.085 --> 34:52.909
- You're not my father.
- Who told you that?

34:52.911 --> 34:54.677
My mom.

34:54.678 --> 34:58.371
When I found those
letters last week.

35:02.263 --> 35:04.354
Baby...

35:07.918 --> 35:10.565
I'm sorry if I scared you.

35:15.503 --> 35:17.792
Bye now.

35:27.437 --> 35:29.790
Once we bag this devil,
wonder how long it takes

35:29.791 --> 35:31.293
to get Woz's Marine released.

35:31.294 --> 35:33.288
I wonder why the floor's sticky.

35:35.154 --> 35:36.787
El diablo Rico Suave?

35:36.788 --> 35:38.815
Randy Royce? He owns the club.

35:38.816 --> 35:40.515
Back office.

35:40.516 --> 35:42.477
Might want to knock.

35:45.255 --> 35:47.772
It's like her legs just
floated up there too.

35:47.773 --> 35:49.668
Like a pelvic sprint.
I like that.

35:49.669 --> 35:51.531
- Yo, focus. We working, man.
- Got a chain too, man.

35:51.532 --> 35:53.135
- Unbelievable.
- Little chastity belt.

35:53.136 --> 35:55.130
Randy Royce! NYPD!

35:55.131 --> 35:56.733
Need to ask you a few questions.

35:56.734 --> 35:57.842
Let's just do this.

35:57.843 --> 36:00.721
I'm getting the clap
just standing here.

36:10.170 --> 36:13.341
Looks like someone
killed our killer.

36:17.232 --> 36:19.453
It's going down tomorrow.

36:19.454 --> 36:22.003
Wozniak met the other party.
Crew voted.

36:22.004 --> 36:23.475
Wait a minute, the face-to-face

36:23.476 --> 36:24.554
has already happened?

36:24.555 --> 36:25.634
We've talked about this, Harlee.

36:25.635 --> 36:27.106
You have got to call me.

36:27.107 --> 36:29.033
Wozniak sprung it on me.
I'm sorry.

36:29.034 --> 36:32.695
Well, who is it? Who's...
who's the third party?

36:32.696 --> 36:34.265
- I don't know.
- Don't do this, Harlee.

36:34.266 --> 36:35.540
He didn't give a name,

36:35.541 --> 36:36.979
but he's somebody important

36:36.980 --> 36:38.318
and we were right
about everything.

36:38.319 --> 36:40.051
My crew fakes a robbery
with two vans,

36:40.052 --> 36:42.209
and then we drop
the cash to Donnie

36:42.210 --> 36:44.563
and this guy who's
calling the shots.

36:44.564 --> 36:46.362
Where's the drop?

36:46.363 --> 36:48.878
I'll know tomorrow.

36:48.879 --> 36:50.448
Stahl.

36:50.449 --> 36:54.145
It's $12 million.

37:00.421 --> 37:03.624
I'm giving you everything,

37:03.625 --> 37:06.928
but I need you to do
something for me too.

37:07.875 --> 37:10.720
Amnesty for the rest of my crew.

37:10.721 --> 37:12.224
Harlee, that was
never on the table.

37:12.225 --> 37:14.446
You could have picked
up any one of us.

37:14.447 --> 37:16.212
The deal's done.

37:16.213 --> 37:18.108
Then undo it.

37:18.109 --> 37:20.658
You keep telling me that
you're the good guy.

37:20.659 --> 37:21.868
Prove it to me.

37:21.869 --> 37:23.471
Harlee...

37:24.452 --> 37:27.132
This is more than you imagined.

37:27.133 --> 37:30.109
I can see that.

37:31.678 --> 37:35.014
I should get more too.

37:35.961 --> 37:38.937
Please.

37:40.898 --> 37:42.204
I need this to end in a way

37:42.205 --> 37:45.181
where I can live with myself.

37:46.424 --> 37:49.496
Make that happen.

38:04.307 --> 38:07.838
Give me a minute.

38:07.839 --> 38:10.814
Wait here.

38:13.266 --> 38:14.736
Yeah, this is Stahl.

38:15.717 --> 38:19.216
Get me Baker.

38:19.217 --> 38:20.948
Uh, yeah. Hey.

38:20.949 --> 38:23.662
Look, Harlee's only willing
to betray Wozniak.

38:23.663 --> 38:24.970
She wants... well, she wants

38:24.971 --> 38:27.487
immunity for the
rest of her crew.

38:27.488 --> 38:29.154
What's it gonna take

38:29.155 --> 38:31.150
to make that happen?

38:55.475 --> 38:56.847
- Hello?
- Uh, Cristina.

38:56.848 --> 38:58.220
Uh, please listen.

38:58.221 --> 39:01.327
I couldn't walk away, not
after what you said to me.

39:02.275 --> 39:04.695
It's not true, baby.

39:04.696 --> 39:05.904
I'm gonna call your
mother right now

39:05.905 --> 39:08.127
and we're gonna clear
this up, okay?

39:16.728 --> 39:18.328
- Hello?
- Harlee.

39:18.329 --> 39:19.832
It's Miguel.

39:19.833 --> 39:21.499
- How did you get my number?
- Listen.

39:21.500 --> 39:23.592
Earlier today, you said that
it was gonna take some time

39:23.593 --> 39:25.814
before you could convince
Cristina to see me.

39:25.815 --> 39:27.385
Nothing's changed, Miguel.

39:27.386 --> 39:29.478
That ain't right.

39:29.479 --> 39:32.944
I'm her father.

39:34.872 --> 39:37.192
And she's a fragile little girl.

39:39.418 --> 39:40.562
Just give her some time.

39:40.563 --> 39:43.666
She'll come around. I swear.

39:43.667 --> 39:46.184
Trust me.

39:46.185 --> 39:48.408
Yeah.

39:48.409 --> 39:50.174
Okay.

39:50.175 --> 39:52.921
Thank you.

39:54.849 --> 39:57.006
Did you hear that?

39:57.007 --> 39:59.721
Your mother lied to you.

39:59.722 --> 40:02.270
I didn't really need to
make that phone call.

40:02.271 --> 40:04.592
You have my eyes, baby.

40:04.593 --> 40:05.803
Even with the door chained up,

40:05.804 --> 40:08.581
I could see that.

40:21.364 --> 40:22.378
Hi, Mom.

40:22.379 --> 40:23.622
Hey, are you okay, baby?

40:23.623 --> 40:26.334
Yeah, yeah. I'm just...
I'm just practicing.

40:26.335 --> 40:28.360
Why?

40:28.361 --> 40:30.617
Oh, I ran my errand. I was
gonna pick up some pizza.

40:30.618 --> 40:33.200
Any requests?

40:33.201 --> 40:34.574
Um, no. Michaela's here.

40:34.575 --> 40:37.025
Her mom's gonna take us to
dinner, if that's okay.

40:37.026 --> 40:39.445
Sure.

40:39.446 --> 40:41.441
Thanks for telling me.

40:43.008 --> 40:44.152
Have fun, honey.

40:44.153 --> 40:47.063
I will.

40:48.011 --> 40:50.495
Well, Baker, uh, took
some convincing,

40:50.496 --> 40:52.980
but she's gonna talk to the U.S.
attorney.

40:56.970 --> 40:59.355
Can I offer you a drink?

41:13.349 --> 41:15.311
So what's the truth?
