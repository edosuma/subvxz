-HOW COME YOU WERE RIDING
AROUND WITH THAT IN YOUR CAR?

07:59.300 --> 08:02.767
-'CAUSE I HAVE A COUPLE OF THEM
'CAUSE WE GO OUT BACK IN MY
HOUSE AND SHOOT 'EM.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.467
-GO BACK AND YOU DRIVE AROUND
THE CITY WITH THOSE IN YOUR CAR?

08:06.567 --> 08:07.933
-I DON'T DRIVE AROUND THE CITY.

08:08.067 --> 08:10.200
-DID YOU STOP ANYWHERE TONIGHT?
DID YOU USE THAT AT ALL TODAY?

08:10.300 --> 08:11.667
-AT MY HOUSE.

08:11.767 --> 08:13.200
-YOU USED IT AT YOUR HOUSE
AND THAT'S IT?

08:13.300 --> 08:14.633
-YEP.
-OKAY.

08:14.733 --> 08:16.900
-I LIVE ON DEN QUARRY ROAD,
OUTBACK 'CAUSE THE POWER LINES.

08:17.067 --> 08:19.700
WE'LL GO OUT BACK
AND WE HAVE A...
WE HAVE WARS.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.067
TWO ON TWO,
THREE ON THREE.
I MEAN, WE GO OUT BACK THERE.

08:22.133 --> 08:23.800
-OKAY.

08:23.900 --> 08:25.733
-IF I WAS TRYING TO DO
ANYTHING WITH IT, THERE WOULDN'T
BE AN ORANGE TIP ON IT.

08:25.833 --> 08:27.700
-ALL RIGHT.
-IS THERE ANOTHER ONE?

08:27.800 --> 08:29.567
-PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE TRUNK
RIGHT HERE. ON THIS.

08:29.667 --> 08:31.600
KEEP YOUR FEET SPREAD.
-THEY'RE LEGAL, RIGHT?

08:31.700 --> 08:33.567
-EXCEPT FOR WHEN YOU GO
SHOOTING AT PEOPLE.

08:33.667 --> 08:34.933
-NO ONE WAS SHOOTING
AT ANYBODY.

08:35.067 --> 08:36.500
-WELL, THAT'S NOT
WHAT WE HAVE.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.367
-MIGHT AS WELL BE A REAL GUN.

08:38.467 --> 08:39.800
-WHEN YOU SHOOT AT PEOPLE--

08:39.900 --> 08:41.067
-I WASN'T SHOOTING AT PEOPLE.

08:41.133 --> 08:42.500
-ESPECIALLY OFFICERS.

08:42.600 --> 08:43.733
-I WASN'T SHOOTING AT ANYBODY.

08:43.833 --> 08:45.433
-OKAY, WELL THEY'RE GONNA
COME HERE AND WE'LL SEE.

08:45.533 --> 08:48.200
-IT'S A PELLET GUN.
WE HAD A REPORT EARLIER,

08:48.300 --> 08:51.267
THIS CAR WAS SHOOTING
AT THE NORTH SHORE
COMMUNITY POLICE.

08:51.367 --> 08:53.567
AND, UH...

08:53.667 --> 08:56.833
WHEN WE PULLED THEM OVER,
THIS WAS LAYING ON THE BACKSEAT.

08:56.933 --> 08:59.433
THE OTHER WAS ON THE FLOOR
OF THE PASSENGER SEAT.

08:59.533 --> 09:02.100
-NOT TRYING TO BE A SMART ASS
OR ANYTHING. I MEAN, I KNOW
MY RIGHTS.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.233
I DIDN'T SHOOT NOTHING.

09:03.333 --> 09:04.700
-THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA
GET TO THE BOTTOM OF.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.267
-NO, I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

09:06.367 --> 09:07.833
I MEAN, AGAIN, THEY'RE
A HUNDRED PERCENT LEGAL.

09:07.933 --> 09:10.733
I DON'T-- YOU KNOW,
I SHOULDN'T BE DETAINED ON IT.

09:10.833 --> 09:12.467
-IT'S NOT LEGAL WHEN YOU SHOOT
IT AT SOMEONE.

09:12.567 --> 09:14.267
-YOU KNOW WHAT, I SHOULDN'T
HAVE HAD THEM IN THE CAR.

09:14.367 --> 09:17.267
THAT WAS A STUPID MISTAKE,
BUT IT'S NOT A MATTER OF BEING
TOO OLD TO PLAY WITH THEM.

09:17.367 --> 09:18.933
OKAY, YOU CAN STILL
LEGALLY BUY THEM.

09:19.067 --> 09:20.967
WHERE I LIVE, WE HAVE LIKE
FOUR ACRES OF WOODS.

09:21.067 --> 09:22.167
WE GO OUT THERE
AND PLAY WITH THEM.

09:22.267 --> 09:23.667
WELL, I SHOULDN'T HAVE
HAD THEM IN THE CAR.

09:23.767 --> 09:25.533
IT'S ACCEPTABLE TO HAVE
THEM OUT THERE, BUT...

09:25.633 --> 09:26.767
YOU UNDERSTAND, LIKE...

09:26.867 --> 09:28.433
-YOU KNOW, AGAIN, I MEAN...

09:28.533 --> 09:29.700
YOU KNOW, IF I WAS REALLY...

09:29.800 --> 09:31.133
-LIKE, THE UZI...

09:31.233 --> 09:32.600
-IT'S A MAC 11.

09:32.700 --> 09:34.200
-MAC 11?

09:36.067 --> 09:38.267
-WE DIDN'T SEE THE ORANGE TIP,
DUDE, AND YOU WERE--

09:38.367 --> 09:39.767
-I UNDERSTAND, BUT--

09:39.867 --> 09:42.233
HEY, I COMPLETELY
UNDERSTAND THAT.
I MEAN, I KNOW.

09:42.333 --> 09:43.933
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY THE ORANGE
TIPS ARE ON.

09:44.067 --> 09:45.633
-YEAH, BUT WE DON'T WANT
THAT TO HAPPEN.

09:45.733 --> 09:48.433
-AND WE ALSO HAVE ANOTHER
TOWN THAT'S HAD AN INCIDENT...

09:49.467 --> 09:52.267
INVOLVING SOMEBODY SHOOTING
A BB GUN AT A CAR.

09:52.367 --> 09:53.833
-Radio:
10, DO YOU HAVE ADAMS?

09:54.867 --> 09:56.400
-YEAH, IT'S AFFIRMATIVE.

09:56.500 --> 10:00.167
-Radio:
THE LICENSE,
THE SAAB PLATE IS EXPIRED.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.867
HIS LICENSE IS GOOD.

10:01.967 --> 10:03.600
-ROGER THAT.
-Radio: 315.

10:03.700 --> 10:06.167
-THIS IS THE NORTH SHORE
COMMUNITY POLICE.

10:06.267 --> 10:09.833
THEY WERE THE ONES THAT
ORIGINALLY CONTACTED US
IN REGARDS TO THE INCIDENT.

10:09.933 --> 10:11.567
-HOW YOU DOIN'?
-HOW'S IT GOING'?

10:11.667 --> 10:13.200
WHAT HAPPENED EARLIER?

10:13.300 --> 10:17.267
-SO PRETTY MUCH, I HAVE A REPORT
OF WHAT TRANSPIRED EARLIER
THIS EVENING.

10:17.367 --> 10:20.033
-OKAY.
-UM, I WAS RIGHT
OUTSIDE THE, UH...

10:20.133 --> 10:23.200
EXTERIOR OF THE WEST ENTRANCE
ABOVE MCGEE BUILDING,

10:23.300 --> 10:26.000
WHEN I SAW WHITE BB'S
FLY IN MY GENERAL DIRECTION.

10:26.100 --> 10:27.500
ONE TO TWO HIT MY CHEST.

10:27.600 --> 10:30.033
-OKAY, SO THEY--
YOU WERE HIT BY...

10:30.133 --> 10:31.900
-YES, SIR.
-THESE BB'S FROM

10:32.000 --> 10:33.567
THE DIRECTION OF THE VEHICLE?

10:33.667 --> 10:34.833
-YES, SIR.
-OKAY.

10:34.933 --> 10:37.100
-AS FAR AS THE EVIDENCE BAG,
I HAVE SIX WHITE BB'S

10:37.200 --> 10:38.600
THAT I COLLECTED FROM THE SCENE.

10:38.700 --> 10:40.100
-OKAY, WERE YOU INJURED?

10:40.200 --> 10:42.000
-NO INJURIES.
-OKAY.

10:42.100 --> 10:45.633
-THESE ARE THE TWO GUYS.
YEAH, HE WAS ACTUALLY WAITING
ON THE TRAFFIC LIGHT, STOPPED,

10:45.733 --> 10:47.767
AND THAT'S WHEN I SAW
THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE

10:47.867 --> 10:50.367
WALK TO THIS VEHICLE,
GET INSIDE THE PASSENGER SIDE.

10:50.467 --> 10:53.667
THIS GENTLEMAN WAS THE DRIVER
AT THE TIME IN WHICH I SAW

10:53.767 --> 10:56.500
THOSE WHITE BB'S SHOT
IN OUR DIRECTION.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.667
-ALL RIGHT, BASED ON THAT,
THEY'RE GOING TO BE TAKEN
INTO CUSTODY

10:58.767 --> 11:00.433
FOR ASSAULT BY MEANS
OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON.

11:00.533 --> 11:01.567
-OKAY.

11:01.667 --> 11:03.133
-TELL THEM THAT I WASN'T EVEN--

11:03.233 --> 11:05.200
-THAT'S WHAT I WAS JUST SAYING.
YEAH, 'CAUSE... (indistinct)

11:05.300 --> 11:07.067
-I WASN'T EVEN WITH HIM.

11:08.733 --> 11:12.667
-CAN YOU TELL THEM I WAS NOT
WITH HIM WHEN YOU PICKED HIM UP?

11:12.767 --> 11:14.267
-WHAT'S THAT?

11:14.367 --> 11:15.867
-THIS GUY HAS NO IDEA
WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.767
I MEAN, WHEN YOU'RE NOT
AN OFFICIAL POLICE OFFICER,

11:17.867 --> 11:19.433
AND YOU'RE A COLLEGE COP,

11:19.533 --> 11:20.933
WHATEVER GETS YOUR ROCKS OFF.

11:21.067 --> 11:22.700
-YOU HIT HIM SIX TIMES
WITH A--

11:22.800 --> 11:24.200
-WHO DID? HIT WHO?

11:24.300 --> 11:26.600
-YOU GUYS DID. THE OFFICER
FROM NORTH SHORE
COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

11:26.700 --> 11:30.067
HE HAS THE BB'S IN
AN EVIDENCE BAG.

11:30.133 --> 11:31.633
-LET ME SEE THE MARKS
ON HIM IF I HIT HIM.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.267
LOOK AT MY BACK,
DO YOU SEE A MARK?

11:33.367 --> 11:35.867
YEAH, 'CAUSE I-- WE WERE
GOING OUT AND I LET
SOMEONE SHOOT ME.

11:35.967 --> 11:37.867
IF THAT WAS THE CASE,
HE WOULD HAVE A MARK ON HIM.

11:37.967 --> 11:40.300
-COME ON--
-HE DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE
ANY MARKS ON HIM.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.600
-I'M COOPERATIVE--

11:41.700 --> 11:43.433
-WELL, RIGHT NOW, WHAT YOU'RE--

11:43.533 --> 11:45.933
RIGHT NOW WHAT YOU'RE BEING
ARRESTED FOR IS ASSAULT BY MEANS
OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON.

11:46.067 --> 11:48.333
YOUR CAR'S BEING TOWED
BECAUSE IT'S EXPIRED.

11:50.933 --> 11:53.300
SO WHAT WAS GOING ON TONIGHT?

11:53.400 --> 11:54.967
WHY ARE YOU RIDING AROUND
WITH THOSE IN THE CAR?

11:55.067 --> 11:58.333
-I WASN'T-- LISTEN, I WASN'T
WITH HIM WHEN HE SHOT
THE NORTH SHORE CAR.

11:58.433 --> 12:01.933
HE JUST PICKED ME UP A FEW--
A FEW, LIKE THIRTY MINUTES AGO.

12:02.067 --> 12:04.067
HE SAID, "YOU WANNA GO
TAKE A RIDE WITH ME?"
I SAID, "FINE."

12:04.167 --> 12:07.400
HOW COME THE NORTH SHORE
CAMPUS OFFICER SAID--

12:07.500 --> 12:09.067
I.D.'D YOU AS BEING
AT THE MCGEE BUILDING?

12:09.100 --> 12:10.700
-THAT'S WHAT I WAS TELLING HIM.

12:10.800 --> 12:13.167
I WASN'T THERE, I DON'T
EVEN GO TO NORTH SHORE.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.200
-HE'S SAYING THERE
WAS TWO PEOPLE
IN THE CAR WHEN THERE--

12:16.300 --> 12:18.067
-I KNOW WHERE HE WAS.
I KNOW--

12:18.100 --> 12:19.767
-AND HE SAID YOU GOT
INTO THE CAR
AT THE STREET--

12:19.867 --> 12:21.133
BROAD STREET.

12:21.233 --> 12:23.067
HE POINTED RIGHT AT YOU
AND SAID YOU WERE

12:23.133 --> 12:25.067
STANDING OVER BY
THE MCGEE BUILDING
BY THE WALL

12:25.100 --> 12:26.467
AND THAT YOU GOT
INTO THE VEHICLE.

12:26.567 --> 12:28.267
-I DON'T EVEN GO TO NORTH SHORE.

12:28.367 --> 12:30.067
I DON'T GO TO NORTH SHORE.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.700
-YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO
TO NORTH SHORE TO BE THERE.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.200
OKAY, RIGHT NOW,
WHAT YOU'RE BEING--

12:33.300 --> 12:35.333
YOU'RE BEING CHARGED WITH
ASSAULT BY MEANS OF
A DANGEROUS WEAPON.

12:35.433 --> 12:36.833
-IT WASN'T ME.
-ALL RIGHT.

12:38.067 --> 12:39.833
I THINK THEY WERE
DEFINITELY UP TO NO GOOD.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.867
THESE ARE--
THEY'RE PLASTIC,

12:41.967 --> 12:44.267
BUT THEY STILL CAN DO
SOME DAMAGE TO SOMEBODY
IF YOU GET HIT WITH THEM.

12:44.367 --> 12:46.667
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS ALL
BACK TO THE STATION,

12:46.767 --> 12:49.933
BE INVENTORIED AND THEN, UH,
ENTERED INTO EVIDENCE.

12:50.067 --> 12:53.100
AND HOPEFULLY WE GET THEM OFF
AND NOT SHOOTING
ANYBODY ANYMORE.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.600
-BEFORE I WAS A COP,
I USED TO MAKE FILMS,

12:57.700 --> 12:59.433
IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA
AND BEHIND THE CAMERA

12:59.533 --> 13:01.700
AND THEN I BECAME A COP
AND IT'S AMAZING

13:01.800 --> 13:03.667
HOW I HAVE TO USE
THE SAME SKILL SET.

13:03.767 --> 13:06.367
BECAUSE EVERY PERSON
YOU MAKE CONTACT WITH,

13:06.467 --> 13:09.633
YOU HAVE TO CREATE
THIS CHARACTER OF WHO THEY ARE
ABLE TO TALK TO

13:09.733 --> 13:11.433
AND WHO IT IS THEY WANT TO SEE.

13:11.533 --> 13:13.967
-SO WE'RE GONNA CHECK OUT A CAR
THAT'S PARKED UP HERE.

13:14.067 --> 13:17.433
THERE'S TWO PEOPLE SITTING
INSIDE OF IT. NO ONE'S INSIDE
THE DRIVER'S SEAT.

13:17.533 --> 13:19.167
AND IT JUST LOOKS A LITTLE OFF,

13:19.267 --> 13:21.200
SO WE'RE GONNA GET OUT
AND SEE WHAT THEY'RE UP TO.

13:28.967 --> 13:30.300
-HI, FOLKS.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.633
-HOW YOU DOIN'?
-I'M OKAY. WHAT ARE
YOU GUYS DOING?

13:32.733 --> 13:34.467
-I WAS WAITING FOR MY BUDDY
TO COME BACK.

13:34.567 --> 13:37.400
(indistinct)
-OH, 'CAUSE I SAW
THE CAR PARKED OVER HERE

13:37.500 --> 13:39.267
AND I JUST THOUGHT
IT LOOKED WEIRD.

13:39.367 --> 13:41.467
-OH, NO, WE'RE WAITING
FOR OUR FRIEND.

13:41.567 --> 13:43.300
-OH, OKAY.
SO WHERE'S YOUR FRIEND?

13:43.400 --> 13:45.267
-HE WENT OVER TO HIS COUSINS
RIGHT UP DOWN THE ROAD.

13:45.367 --> 13:47.467
-WELL, WOULD YOU GUYS MIND
GIVING US YOUR INFORMATION
REAL QUICK?

13:47.567 --> 13:49.233
-SURE.
-THANKS, APPRECIATE THAT.

13:49.333 --> 13:51.600
-YEAH, I'M GONNA BE HONEST
WITH YOU OFFICER, I'VE GOT
A WARRANT FOR MY ARREST.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.533
-HOW ABOUT YOU?
YOU HAVE A WARRANT
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

13:53.633 --> 13:54.933
-I DON'T HAVE A RECORD.
-NO RECORD AT ALL?

13:55.067 --> 13:56.067
HOW OLD ARE YOU?
-22.

13:56.133 --> 13:57.967
-22? OKAY, I'LL COME
TO YOUR SIDE.

13:58.067 --> 13:59.900
SINCE I KNOW YOU HAVE A BLADE
IN THERE, I'M GONNA HAVE YOU

14:00.067 --> 14:01.333
INTERLACE YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR HEAD.

14:02.767 --> 14:04.367
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO JAIL FOR?

14:04.467 --> 14:06.400
-JUST GONNA BE A WARRANT
FOR MY ARREST IN STAR COURT.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.900
THEY'RE GONNA REVOKE MY ASS,
I'LL GET TO GO UPSTATE.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.067
-JUST GONNA TAKE THAT KNIFE
OUT OF HERE.

14:13.133 --> 14:14.800
-YEP, GO AHEAD.
-THANKS, I APPRECIATE IT.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.267
MICHAEL, DO YOU WANT
TO HAVE A SEAT OVER HERE, MAN?

14:19.367 --> 14:20.833
ON THE CURB, RIGHT HERE.

14:20.933 --> 14:23.800
-I'VE DEALT WITH YOU BEFORE.
I REMEMBER YOU RAN FROM US
ONE TIME.

14:23.900 --> 14:25.400
-YEAH.
-YEAH.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.633
YOU HAD A WARRANT AND YOU RAN
AND I THINK YOU GOT AWAY
THAT NIGHT.

14:27.733 --> 14:28.800
-YEAH. YEAH.

14:28.900 --> 14:30.767
-WELL, HERE WE ARE.
WE GOT YOU TONIGHT.

14:30.867 --> 14:32.067
IS THIS YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

14:32.133 --> 14:33.800
-NO, SHE'S JUST A FRIEND.
-OKAY.

14:33.900 --> 14:36.233
-SO YOU GUYS AREN'T
OVER HERE DOING SOME
MAJOR DRUG DEAL?

14:36.333 --> 14:37.733
-(laughing) NO.

14:37.833 --> 14:39.433
I MEAN, I'M GETTING
A RIDE FROM PABLO.

14:39.533 --> 14:41.100
-PABLO? IS THAT
YOUR LITTLE PURSE?

14:41.200 --> 14:42.367
-CAN I SEE IT?

14:42.467 --> 14:44.633
-IS THERE A REASON WHY
YOU'RE SEARCHING ME THOUGH?

14:44.733 --> 14:46.400
-I'M ASKING YOU YOUR PERMISSION.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.600
-WELL, I NEVER SAID EVEN TO--

14:48.700 --> 14:50.733
THERE'S NO REASON FOR YOU
TO SEARCH IT, THOUGH, RIGHT?

14:50.833 --> 14:52.300
-YOU TELL ME.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.733
I MEAN, I'LL TELL--
-I MEAN, I DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG IN HERE.

14:54.833 --> 14:56.400
-I DON'T KNOW
THAT YOU DID OR YOU DIDN'T.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.067
-RIGHT, SO--
-IF-- IF YOU'D FEEL
MORE COMFORTABLE,

14:58.133 --> 14:59.433
YOU CAN OPEN IT UP
AND SHOW ME.

14:59.533 --> 15:01.367
-WELL, I MEAN,
I DON'T HAVE TO.
-I MEAN--

15:01.467 --> 15:03.067
-I MEAN,
I HAVE MY RIGHTS, RIGHT?

15:03.100 --> 15:04.733
-YOU DO HAVE RIGHTS.
-OKAY.

15:04.833 --> 15:07.833
-AND WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW--
-AM I BREAKING THE LAW
RIGHT NOW, THOUGH?

15:07.933 --> 15:09.233
-WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW

15:09.333 --> 15:11.667
IS, I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE.

15:11.767 --> 15:13.133
-OKAY.
-YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY I.D. ON YOU.

15:13.233 --> 15:15.800
-OKAY. UH-HUH.
-YOU'RE IN A CAR
THAT DOESN'T BELONG TO YOU.

15:15.900 --> 15:18.333
-RIGHT.
-THE GUY SITTING NEXT TO YOU

15:18.433 --> 15:20.967
HAS A WARRANT FOR HIS ARREST.
-I DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM.
THIS IS MY FIRST DAY OF...

15:21.067 --> 15:23.633
-I UNDERSTAND,
SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS,

15:23.733 --> 15:25.800
YES, SOMETHING IS FISHY HERE,

15:25.900 --> 15:27.300
UNDENIABLY.

15:27.400 --> 15:29.167
-BECAUSE HE HAS A WARRANT?

15:29.267 --> 15:31.567
-BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING HERE.

15:31.667 --> 15:35.067
-WE CAN'T-- WE'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO JUST PULL OVER

15:35.133 --> 15:38.167
-WELL, YOU'RE TELLING ME,

15:44.933 --> 15:47.200
-Michael: THAT'S ALL I KNOW.
HIS NAME'S SPOOKY.
THAT'S ABOUT IT.

15:47.300 --> 15:48.467
HE'S A WHITE GUY.

15:48.567 --> 15:50.567
-YOU'RE KIND OF RAISING
ALL OF MY FLAGS RIGHT NOW.

15:50.667 --> 15:53.067

15:53.133 --> 15:56.067
-NOW I'VE GOT A GUY WHO'S GOT
TWO STREET NAMES
BUT NO REAL NAME?

15:56.133 --> 15:58.967
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS
A STOLEN CAR. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

15:59.067 --> 16:02.067
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE SOMETHING
THAT YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU NEED TO HIDE FROM ME.

16:02.100 --> 16:04.300
AND YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT--
-Michael: OKAY, I STOLE THE CAR.

16:08.567 --> 16:11.200
-AND WHEN YOU GUYS WERE
COMING BUY, I WENT OFF
AND THREW THE KEY.

16:11.300 --> 16:13.267
I DON'T KNOW HOW FAR I THREW IT,
BUT I THREW IT.

16:13.367 --> 16:15.200
-HEY, KYLIE, I'M GONNA HAVE YOU
STEP FROM THE CAR.

16:15.300 --> 16:17.267
HERE, YOU CAN STEP BACK
UP ON THE SIDEWALK.

16:17.367 --> 16:18.633
I DON'T WANT YOU TO FALL.

16:18.733 --> 16:21.833
WHY ARE YOU GETTING REALLY
CONFRONTATIONAL AND AGITATED?

16:21.933 --> 16:24.200
-BECAUSE I HAVE METH

WHAT YOU WANNA REALLY KNOW.

16:24.300 --> 16:25.900
-OKAY.

HONEST WITH YOU NOW.

16:26.067 --> 16:27.500
-OKAY.
-BECAUSE, MIGHT AS WELL,

16:27.600 --> 16:29.367
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA

16:30.467 --> 16:31.900
-WELL--

16:32.067 --> 16:33.833
-I MEAN, IT'S LIKE I DON'T--

-YEP.

16:41.467 --> 16:44.133
-YOU HAVE A LOT OR A LITTLE?
-I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD
CONSIDER A LOT.

16:44.233 --> 16:45.733
-SHALL WE LOOK?
-GO AHEAD.

16:45.833 --> 16:47.500
-DO YOU KNOW THIS GUY,
MICHAEL?

16:47.600 --> 16:49.100
-NO, I JUST MET HIM TONIGHT

16:49.200 --> 16:51.067
NOT EVEN 25, 30 MINUTES AGO.

16:51.100 --> 16:52.367
-DID YOU GET THIS FROM PABLO?

16:52.467 --> 16:54.300
-NO.
-HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
DOING THIS JUNK?

16:54.400 --> 16:55.700
-NOT EVEN A YEAR.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.667
-WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT
ON THE CURB OVER HERE.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.533

WHAT IS IT THAT
YOU'RE CRYING ABOUT?

17:02.700 --> 17:04.733
-(crying) BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO GO TO JAIL.

17:04.833 --> 17:07.300
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
IT WAS A STOLEN CAR.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.200
-OKAY. WHAT ABOUT
THE DOPE PART?
-(cell phone ringing)

17:09.300 --> 17:12.400
-WELL, YEAH I KNOW THAT'S--
OBVIOUSLY I KNEW THAT WAS THERE,

17:12.500 --> 17:14.467
BUT, I MEAN, STOLEN CAR.

17:14.567 --> 17:17.167
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT NO STOLEN CAR.

17:17.267 --> 17:19.633
DO YOU THINK I WOULD SIT MYSELF
IN THE BACK OF A STOLEN CAR

17:19.733 --> 17:23.100
WITH NO RECORD, AND LIKE HAVE
THE CHANCE OF GETTING
PULLED OVER OR SOMETHING?

17:23.200 --> 17:25.967
NO! (crying)

17:26.067 --> 17:28.733
I'M SORRY. I'M JUST--
OH MY GOD.

17:28.833 --> 17:31.133
-HEY, YOU DON'T NEED TO BE SORRY
THAT YOU'RE UPSET.

17:31.233 --> 17:33.700
I'M GLAD YOU'RE UPSET.
YOU SHOULD BE UPSET.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.433
ALL RIGHT, HANG OUT.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH YOU.

17:35.533 --> 17:36.900
-(crying continues)

17:37.067 --> 17:38.600
-OKAY, MIKE. NOT YOUR CAR?

17:38.700 --> 17:40.133
-IT'S NOT STOLEN.
I TOLD YOU THAT

17:40.233 --> 17:41.833
'CAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD
GET HER OUT OF TROUBLE.

17:41.933 --> 17:43.333
OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT.

17:43.433 --> 17:45.800
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WAS IN HER PURSE.

17:45.900 --> 17:47.700
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT WAS IN MY BAG.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.267
ALL I KNOW IS

17:49.367 --> 17:51.067
IS THAT NO, WE GOT
A RIDE FROM OUR BUDDY.

17:51.100 --> 17:53.133
-SPOOKY?
-I TOLD HIM THE SAME THING
I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU.

17:53.233 --> 17:55.067
-PABLO?
-I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU
MY BUDDY'S NAME

17:55.133 --> 17:58.067
'CAUSE I LIVE BY A CODE,
BY THE CRIMINAL CODE OF SILENCE.

17:58.100 --> 17:59.533
I'M NOT TELLING YOU HIS NAME.

17:59.633 --> 18:00.700
-WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME?

18:00.800 --> 18:02.333
-I GOT IN HIS CAR,
AND PICK HER UP.

18:02.433 --> 18:03.533
BUT HE WAS ALMOST OUT OF GAS.

18:03.633 --> 18:05.467
-I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO CUT YOU OFF AT ALL.

18:05.567 --> 18:07.967
YOU'RE BUDDY CAME OVER HERE,

18:08.067 --> 18:10.233
THE CAR WAS RUNNING OUT OF GAS.
WHAT WAS YOUR
BUDDY'S NAME AGAIN?

18:10.333 --> 18:12.133
-UH.
-AW!

18:12.233 --> 18:14.600
YOU ALMOST--
I ALMOST GOT YOU, DUDE.
-NOPE.

18:14.700 --> 18:17.333
-YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN
KICKED OUT OF
THE CRIMINAL SILENCE CODE CLUB.

18:17.433 --> 18:19.167
-NO, I WOULD HAVE BEEN
CALLED A SNITCH.

18:19.267 --> 18:21.633
I'M NOT GONNA WEAR
A RAT JACKET.

18:21.733 --> 18:23.400
ESPECIALLY IF
I'M GOING TO PRISON.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.567
'CAUSE THIS IS MY
LAST STRIKE IN STAR COURT.

18:25.667 --> 18:27.333
HER? IT'S HER FIRST TIME
GOING TO JAIL,

18:27.433 --> 18:28.833
SO, UH, SHE'LL GET RECOGGED.

18:28.933 --> 18:31.900
HER MOM WILL BE PISSED,
BUT SHE'S GONNA GO HOME.

18:32.067 --> 18:33.933
AND THEN SHE GETS TO
SLEEP HAPPY.

18:34.067 --> 18:35.967
I GET TO SLEEP HAPPY,
'CAUSE I'M ON A BED.

18:36.067 --> 18:37.667
AND I KNOW THAT
I'M GONNA BE FED.

18:37.767 --> 18:40.067
-WHAT ABOUT YOUR BUDDY?
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO
TOW THAT CAR.

18:40.100 --> 18:41.200
-WHAT ABOUT MY BUDDY?

18:41.300 --> 18:43.100
EH, HE CAN WORRY ABOUT HIMSELF.
HE'S A GROWN MAN.

18:43.200 --> 18:44.567
-ALL RIGHT. THANKS.

18:44.667 --> 18:49.800
KYLIE, DO YOU KNOW
THAT METHAMPHETAMINE
IS A CLASS C FELONY?

18:49.900 --> 18:51.900
-(sniff) NO.

18:52.067 --> 18:54.133
-SO A CLASS C FELONY
GOES ON YOUR RECORD PERMANENTLY,

18:54.233 --> 18:57.233
AND IT IS NO LESS THAN
ONE YEAR IN PRISON.

18:57.333 --> 18:58.867
THAT'S A LOT OF TIME
FOR A 22-YEAR-OLD

18:58.967 --> 19:00.933
WHO SHOULD BE DOING
BETTER THINGS WITH HER LIFE.

19:01.067 --> 19:02.967
SO I'M GONNA TELL YOU
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

19:03.067 --> 19:06.067
I HAVE FIVE YEARS
TO CHARGE YOU WITH THIS,

19:06.133 --> 19:08.833
AND EVERY MONTH,
I'M GONNA RUN YOUR NAME
ONCE A MONTH.

19:08.933 --> 19:10.367
-(whimpering) OKAY.

19:10.467 --> 19:13.533
AND IF I FIND THAT
YOU'VE BEEN ARRESTED FOR
ANOTHER DRUG CHARGE

19:13.633 --> 19:17.600
IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS,
I AM GOING TO SUBMIT AN ARREST
FOR TONIGHT,

19:17.700 --> 19:21.200
WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE MOTIVATION
TO STOP ACTING LIKE A FOOL

19:21.300 --> 19:23.100
AND LEAD THE LIFE
YOU WANT TO BE LEADING.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.700
-(sniffle)
-GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

19:25.800 --> 19:27.333
ALL RIGHT, MICHAEL, STAND UP.

WE'RE GONNA GET YOU TO JAIL.

19:28.733 --> 19:32.333
-* 'CAUSE I'M READY TO GO
AND LET YOU DOWN *

19:32.433 --> 19:35.800
* SAY HELLO TO ALL MY
HOMIES THERE *

19:35.900 --> 19:38.067
-MICHAEL, YOU ACTUALLY THINK
YOU'RE GONNA GO SERVE
SOME TIME OR WHAT?

19:38.167 --> 19:40.067
-YEAH, 'CAUSE
I'M AN ABSCONDER.

19:40.100 --> 19:41.133
I ABSCOND A LOT,

19:41.233 --> 19:43.333
SO THEY TOLD ME
IF I ABSCOND AGAIN

19:43.433 --> 19:45.167
THAT'D BE THE LAST CHANCE,
YOU KNOW?

19:45.267 --> 19:46.967
-ALL RIGHT, DUDE.
-ALL RIGHT.

19:47.067 --> 19:48.333
-GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
-THANK YOU.

19:49.467 --> 19:50.500
-Officer over radio:
132 AND BUSH.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.167
I'VE GOT HIM AT GUNPOINT.

19:52.267 --> 19:53.933
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, GUNPOINT, 132 AND BUSH.

19:54.067 --> 19:54.967
COVER IS CODE THREE.

19:55.067 --> 19:58.067

police radio chatter)

20:03.567 --> 20:05.500
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, STILL SEND A CODE THREE.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.100
