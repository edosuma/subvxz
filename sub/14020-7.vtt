00:01.200 --> 00:03.000
NARRATOR: In the
criminal justice system

00:03.000 --> 00:06.800
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:06.900 --> 00:08.700
the police
who investigate crime

00:08.800 --> 00:11.600
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.300
These are their stories.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.500
I had a lady once.

00:16.600 --> 00:20.100
Swore a rat rolled a
wheel of parmesan

00:20.200 --> 00:23.300
right out the fridge
while she was sleeping.

00:23.300 --> 00:24.700
(CHUCKLING) All right.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.500
It's the super. I got
the exterminator here.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.100
Anybody home?

00:37.500 --> 00:38.600
Miss Knowles?

00:38.800 --> 00:40.000
(RATTLING DOORKNOB)

00:40.200 --> 00:42.100
Having some trouble, here?

00:42.200 --> 00:43.700
(MOANING) Oh, God.

00:44.300 --> 00:46.700
Oh! Oh!
Get help.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.900
Oh, you're gonna be all right.
You'll be okay.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.400
Victim's Cecilia Knowles.
She's 36 years old.

00:53.800 --> 00:56.800
She was a mess. Clothes were ripped.
Eyes glazed over.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.500
EMS rolled her to Mercy Trauma.

00:58.600 --> 00:59.900
What'd the neighbors
have to say?

01:00.000 --> 01:02.600
Downstairs apartment heard
noises sometime after midnight.

01:02.700 --> 01:04.400
Didn't think it was
anything to worry about.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.800
Or worth getting
out of bed for. Thanks.

01:06.800 --> 01:11.200
No, no, the only other person we
saw up here this morning was 6J.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.400
And he left
about 7:15.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.100
His work number is on his rental
application if you need it.

01:16.200 --> 01:19.000
That'd be a help. How about Ms. Knowles?
You know her very well?

01:19.100 --> 01:21.400
She moved here from
Albany a few months ago.

01:21.300 --> 01:22.600
I fixed her closet once.

01:22.700 --> 01:24.000
She lived alone?
Uh-huh.

01:24.100 --> 01:26.200
Boyfriend? I haven't
noticed anyone.

01:26.300 --> 01:27.800
I'd like to see
her rental application.

01:27.900 --> 01:29.200
Sure. I'll get it.

01:31.200 --> 01:35.000
MARGO: The attack started here,
and then finished in here.

01:35.400 --> 01:36.600
BRISCOE: Mmm.

01:36.800 --> 01:40.000
Looks like some night
baseball got out of control.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.400
MARGO: We're bagging
and tagging the linens.

01:42.900 --> 01:44.400
BRISCOE:
Nice looking family.

01:44.500 --> 01:46.400
No family names in here.

01:46.700 --> 01:48.100
Business cards,

01:50.000 --> 01:51.300
from all over the country.

01:51.300 --> 01:52.600
NICK: Here's
her application.

01:52.600 --> 01:54.000
Thank you.

01:55.900 --> 01:57.600
She moved in five months ago.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.000
Any next of kin?

01:59.100 --> 02:01.700
Fly-Away Travel.
That's what she wrote.

02:01.900 --> 02:03.000
East 47th street.

02:03.100 --> 02:04.600
Yeah. She's a travel agent.

02:04.700 --> 02:06.800
She put her boss
as next of kin?

02:07.200 --> 02:08.699
Might as well die alone.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.300
She almost did.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:59.900 --> 03:02.800
Ligature marks on her neck.
Bruising on her inner thighs.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.700
Rape kit's been sealed
and sent to your lab.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.100
When will she be able to talk?

03:06.100 --> 03:09.300
She's in a coma. Neurology's
been called in to take a look.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.600
So, you don't know when?

03:10.700 --> 03:13.800
Or if. She presented with
anoxic brain injury.

03:13.900 --> 03:15.000
From the strangling?

03:15.100 --> 03:16.400
Well, that's one possibility.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.400
What's the other?

03:17.500 --> 03:19.300
An allergic reaction
to Demerol.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.900
We found trace amounts
of it in her blood.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.500
Are you sure? Because we didn't
find any pills in her place.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.600
Well, how about a syringe?

03:28.000 --> 03:31.100
This bruise here, right in the
middle, there's a needle mark.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.900
The Demerol was injected.

03:34.100 --> 03:35.400
There's no syringe
in her apartment.

03:35.500 --> 03:36.800
The doer doped her up?

03:36.800 --> 03:40.500
Sometime between midnight and 2:00
a.m., according to the doctor.

03:40.500 --> 03:43.000
And that's on top of the couple
of drinks she had before that.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.900
Cocktails. No forced entry.
Could be date rape.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.100
Who was this girl seeing?

03:47.200 --> 03:48.300
We've been looking
through her phone book.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.000
A lot of disconnected numbers
in Albany, answering machines.

03:51.100 --> 03:54.200
Local numbers are nail
salons, take outs, airlines.

03:54.300 --> 03:56.700
Apparently, Ms. Knowles
was married to her work.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.300
Then try co-workers.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.800
Well, I'm pretty sure she
wasn't seeing anybody.

04:04.800 --> 04:08.000
We were just talking the other day
how hard it is to meet people.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.900
What hospital is she at? Mercy.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.100
Oh, I should get flowers.

04:11.100 --> 04:12.300
She's in a coma.

04:12.700 --> 04:14.700
Oh, well, I mean, still.

04:14.700 --> 04:16.700
I mean, if Cecilia wakes up,
and there's nobody there.

04:16.700 --> 04:18.300
Oh, this is so awful.

04:18.300 --> 04:19.399
Is this her sister?

04:19.500 --> 04:21.600
Yeah, Julie, her kid sister.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.400
Any idea where we can find her?

04:23.500 --> 04:26.500
Well, Cecilia said she
passed away a few years ago.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.800
Any other family?

04:27.900 --> 04:30.900
Um... She said her parents died
when she was still in college.

04:30.900 --> 04:34.200
And there's an ex-husband. Steven Knowles.
She said he was a drunk.

04:34.300 --> 04:35.700
Do you know where
we can find him?

04:35.700 --> 04:37.900
I don't know. It sounded like she
hadn't spoken to him in years.

04:38.100 --> 04:39.300
Anyone else you can think of?

04:41.100 --> 04:44.200
She said she'd been in love
once, not with the ex.

04:44.300 --> 04:46.500
You might try where she
used to work, up in Albany.

04:46.500 --> 04:47.700
The State Travel Division.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.200
She mention any plans
she had for last night?

04:50.300 --> 04:53.400
Well, I had some plane tickets to
drop off at the Mayflower Hotel

04:53.300 --> 04:55.600
for a client, and she
offered to take them.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.900
Was that on her way?

04:56.900 --> 05:00.100
Well, actually, no. But
she said she didn't mind.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.900
Yes. She was in last night with a
package for one of our guests.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.500
The Gilberts.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.900
She left it at the desk
about 10:00 o'clock.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.300
That late? You sure?

05:09.400 --> 05:11.300
I was just about
to go off duty.

05:11.300 --> 05:12.900
She with anybody?

05:13.100 --> 05:15.300
Well, she was wearing
a cocktail dress.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.500
Maybe someone was waiting
for her outside.

05:17.700 --> 05:18.800
Well?

05:18.900 --> 05:22.400
I didn't see anybody. She just came out.
I offered to get her a cab.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.400
She said no. Then she went across
the street to the Swanson.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.600
Thanks.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.000
MIKE: Sure, I remember her.

05:32.100 --> 05:34.100
Glass of merlot. She sat
at a table in the back.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.200
By herself?

05:35.300 --> 05:36.500
Couple of guys tried
to buy her a drink.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.900
But she told me she was waiting
for an old friend from Albany.

05:39.100 --> 05:40.400
You see what the guy
looked like?

05:40.500 --> 05:42.200
No. I notice the ladies.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.400
The guys in the business suits,
they all look the same to me.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.400
ED: Maybe if we check
the credit card receipts.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.700
I doubt the guy
had time for a drink.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.800
I looked over, and
bang, she was gone.

05:49.900 --> 05:51.000
Okay I get back to work?

05:51.300 --> 05:52.600
Yeah, go ahead.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.500
Our little wallflower
blooms at night.

05:56.500 --> 06:00.400
Old friend in a business suit. Maybe if
we check her business card collection.

06:01.300 --> 06:02.700
Hong Kong. Some guys
have all the fun.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.600
I wouldn't know from Hong Kong.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.300
My old man took me.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.800
What'd he do, work
for the National Geographic?

06:08.800 --> 06:10.700
Oil business.
Petro-chemical engineer.

06:10.900 --> 06:12.200
A brainiac.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.800
I'm sure this is just what
he had in mind for you.

06:14.900 --> 06:16.100
Yeah.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.800
Right. Stuart Ruskus.

06:20.800 --> 06:24.100
Oh, I see. Sorry for your loss.
Thanks.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.800
Guy croaked a year ago.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.300
Kenneth Taylor.
Deputy press secretary

06:29.300 --> 06:31.400
for the New York State Comptroller.
Come on down.

06:32.700 --> 06:34.400
Hi, Kenneth Taylor, please.

06:34.700 --> 06:36.900
I'm Detective Ed Green
of the New York Police.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.200
He did?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.500
Do you have that address?

06:44.200 --> 06:45.700
Thank you very much.

06:47.400 --> 06:50.400
Kenneth Taylor moved down
from Albany last summer.

06:50.500 --> 06:53.400
To an apartment two blocks
from the Swanson Hotel.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.200
Knowles, the name
sounds familiar.

06:56.200 --> 06:59.800
So, you have no idea why she
had your card in her bedroom?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.500
No. I can't
place her. Sorry.

07:01.600 --> 07:02.600
Taylor.

07:02.600 --> 07:03.800
She used to work in the state

07:03.900 --> 07:06.300
government travel
division up in Albany.

07:08.300 --> 07:09.600
That's right.
That's right.

07:09.700 --> 07:12.500
She handled some travel arrangements
for me awhile ago. Yes.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.100
Now you remember?

07:15.600 --> 07:19.200
Yes, now I remember. And now
I have to get back to work.

07:19.500 --> 07:23.200
Before you do that, you mind telling
us where you were Tuesday night?

07:23.300 --> 07:25.400
I was at home working
on the press campaign

07:25.500 --> 07:27.000
for the audit
of the Hudson River

07:27.000 --> 07:28.700
Small Crafts
Navigation Program.

07:29.400 --> 07:32.100
I'm filling up with
anticipation And after that?

07:32.500 --> 07:34.300
I ordered a movie
on pay-per-view.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.800
And I fell asleep
before it ended.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.000
ED: Any phone calls?

07:37.200 --> 07:39.600
My brother, asking me
to go sailing with him.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.000
And my fiancée called
just after midnight.

07:42.200 --> 07:45.000
She's at a conference in California.
Now can I go?

07:45.400 --> 07:47.500
And other than that
one time in Albany,

07:47.600 --> 07:49.300
you've had no contact
with Cecilia Knowles?

07:50.400 --> 07:51.500
That's right.

07:52.600 --> 07:53.800
Now you can go.

07:54.300 --> 07:55.400
Thank you.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.600
Check his IUDS?

07:58.700 --> 07:59.900
And hers.

08:01.400 --> 08:04.600
Cable company confirms Taylor ordered
a movie at 20 past midnight.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.900
Shakespeare In Heat.
Cause and effect.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.700
I don't know about the effect.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.000
Rape kit was negative
for seminal fluid.

08:11.100 --> 08:13.100
Phone records.
His and hers.

08:13.100 --> 08:15.900
New York and Albany.
No calls in either direction.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.100
But there are these calls she
made to Queens from Albany.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.900
She called the 116th precinct?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.200
Couple of times a month
before she moved here.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.800
Checking on the crime rate?

08:28.500 --> 08:30.500
She was calling about her sister.
Julie Gorham.

08:30.600 --> 08:32.000
Gorham.
From three years ago?

08:32.100 --> 08:34.600
The one and the same.
Missing, presumed murdered.

08:34.700 --> 08:37.100
Girl flies in LaGuardia from
Albany to visit her boyfriend.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.700
Hasn't been seen since.

08:38.799 --> 08:40.200
Boyfriend a suspect?
Uh-huh.

08:40.299 --> 08:43.299
Stormy relationship, but we
could never make a case.

08:43.299 --> 08:45.900
Worst part of the job having
no answers for the family.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.200
When's the last time
you talked to Cecilia?

08:48.700 --> 08:50.300
Month ago. Very upset.

08:50.300 --> 08:52.300
She ran into the
boyfriend in the city.

08:52.300 --> 08:54.000
You got the file?
Yeah.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.300
She was always convinced
the guy did her sister.

08:57.400 --> 08:58.600
If we'd been able to
take the gloves off...

08:58.900 --> 09:00.000
Why didn't you?

09:00.100 --> 09:02.300
Guy's some mucky muck
in state government.

09:02.400 --> 09:03.700
Yeah, right.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.400
Our film buff, Kenny Taylor.

09:11.900 --> 09:13.200
Yes, you're right. I lied.

09:13.300 --> 09:15.100
I was stalling you so I
could talk to my lawyer.

09:15.100 --> 09:17.000
I learned my lesson about
dealing with you people.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.600
What lesson's that? That
we're as stupid as we look?

09:19.600 --> 09:22.500
I've been through this circus
before when Julie disappeared.

09:22.700 --> 09:24.400
That's where you
learned to lie?

09:24.500 --> 09:27.100
There. That's what I mean.
You just twist everything.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.900
All right, Ken, you don't have
to get into it with them.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.200
I'm okay.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.200
Just ask your question.

09:32.300 --> 09:33.600
We just want
to verify a few things.

09:33.600 --> 09:36.800
Now, you said you hadn't seen Ms. Knowles
since you moved to the city.

09:36.900 --> 09:38.000
Right.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.100
Well, she told the
detective in Queens

09:41.100 --> 09:43.900
that she ran into you
about a month ago.

09:44.600 --> 09:48.100
Okay, sure. Um, on my lunch hour.
It was in midtown.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.400
What'd you talk about?

09:49.500 --> 09:52.500
Nothing. I tried to be polite and get
away from her as fast as I could.

09:52.500 --> 09:55.200
She's still laboring under
the delusion I killed Julie.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.000
A lot of people
have that delusion.

09:57.300 --> 09:58.500
Next question.

09:58.600 --> 10:01.200
We read the investigators'
reports on Julie Gorham.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.700
The one thing everyone
remarked on was your temper.

10:04.700 --> 10:05.800
You trying to bait me?

10:05.900 --> 10:07.500
Just stating the facts.

10:07.500 --> 10:10.000
You have a thin skin. That's why
Julie was breaking up with you.

10:10.100 --> 10:11.600
That's why she came
down to New York.

10:11.700 --> 10:13.300
That's according to Cecilia.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.800
The truth is, we were
making a fresh start.

10:16.100 --> 10:20.200
I had the hotel room ready. I had champagne, flowers.
She never got to the hotel.

10:20.500 --> 10:21.800
And that's according to you.

10:21.900 --> 10:22.900
It's what happened.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.100
They have a record of her
getting on the plane, Ken.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.000
What, she jumped
out over Poughkeepsie?

10:27.000 --> 10:28.500
Damn it, I didn't kill her!

10:28.600 --> 10:30.400
See, it still gets
to you, doesn't it?

10:30.700 --> 10:32.200
You thought you had
it all put behind you

10:32.300 --> 10:33.700
when you came down from Albany,

10:33.700 --> 10:35.000
and bang, you run
into the big sister.

10:35.100 --> 10:37.700
I've got better things to do
than worry about a crazy woman.

10:37.800 --> 10:40.200
A guy like you? I don't think
you'd just walk away from it.

10:40.900 --> 10:43.400
You wanted to reason with her, you
know, have a little sit down,

10:43.500 --> 10:45.700
bury the hatchet There was
no reasoning with her.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.300
But you tried
anyway, didn't you?

10:47.400 --> 10:49.500
You met up with her at the
bar at the Swanson Hotel.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.700
Maybe you didn't get the
satisfaction you wanted.

10:51.700 --> 10:53.400
You went home,
you stewed about it.

10:53.500 --> 10:54.600
No, no!

10:54.700 --> 10:57.700
And you went to her place, you gave
her some bull, and she let you in.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.500
That's enough.
And you did to her

10:59.400 --> 11:01.600
just what you did to her
sister, didn't you?

11:01.700 --> 11:03.500
No! I never laid
a hand on her!

11:03.600 --> 11:05.300
CHARLES: Ken.
I know my rights.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.100
I know where I stand.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.200
I've talked to them as much as I have to.
I'm leaving.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.800
Next time you want
to talk to him,

11:11.900 --> 11:14.000
you'd better bring
a subpoena or a warrant.

11:16.700 --> 11:19.900
We showed his picture around
the Swanson bar. No takers.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.200
None of the neighbors either.

11:21.300 --> 11:24.200
Well, if she was meeting with the man who
murdered her sister, it's a big thing.

11:24.300 --> 11:25.800
You'd think she
would've told someone.

11:25.800 --> 11:28.500
Who? Her nail salon
or the Chinese take-out?

11:28.600 --> 11:31.400
Did you get any call backs
from those numbers in Albany?

11:31.500 --> 11:34.300
Three. None of them had talked
to Cecilia in at least a year.

11:34.300 --> 11:36.100
They got tired of watching
her grind the same ax.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.600
Well, she used to work for
the state travel division.

11:38.700 --> 11:40.100
Have you tried up there?

11:41.400 --> 11:42.900
Have a nice drive.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.600
You believe in family curses?

11:50.200 --> 11:51.400
I didn't.

11:51.900 --> 11:53.500
Then I met Cecilia.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.600
Parents go in a car accident,

11:56.700 --> 11:58.000
then Julie.

11:58.100 --> 11:59.800
(SIGHING) Now this.

11:59.900 --> 12:01.200
ED: You knew Julie?

12:02.100 --> 12:03.400
Very sweet person.

12:03.600 --> 12:06.100
She was in management at one
of the TV stations in town.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.500
Cecilia was so proud of her.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.500
Then along came Ken Taylor.

12:10.900 --> 12:13.200
Had you talked
to Cecilia recently?

12:13.300 --> 12:15.500
No. Not since she moved.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.300
ED: Anybody else
she might've talked to?

12:18.200 --> 12:21.100
I don't think so.
It's been difficult.

12:22.100 --> 12:23.700
Julie's death just ate at her.

12:23.800 --> 12:26.500
While she was here, was she
ever in contact with Taylor?

12:26.600 --> 12:28.700
Well, a couple of months
before she moved,

12:28.800 --> 12:31.000
she had a run in
with him at a function.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.700
She accused him,

12:32.800 --> 12:35.300
said she'd never let him
forget what he did to Julie.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.000
How did he react?

12:38.200 --> 12:41.800
Well, she started having our
secretary screen her calls.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.900
Gave her specific instructions
not to put Taylor through.

12:44.900 --> 12:46.100
Did he ever try to call her?

12:47.200 --> 12:48.300
I don't know.

12:48.700 --> 12:50.300
But Cecilia always
made sure one of us

12:50.400 --> 12:51.800
walked her to her
car in the evening.

12:51.900 --> 12:53.200
She ever go to the police?

12:54.800 --> 12:58.700
I told her she could get a restraining order.
I don't know if she ever went.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.500
And then she moved.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.700
Just a month before Taylor did.

13:02.800 --> 13:03.900
He moved after she did?

13:04.200 --> 13:07.000
Yes. I heard about it
through the grapevine.

13:08.300 --> 13:09.900
I left her a message
to warn her.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.100
But she never called back.

13:12.800 --> 13:16.500
He signed his lease July
12th, moved in July 30th.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.600
She signed hers June 24th.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.300
Could be a coincidence.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.200
Yes, I'm still here.

13:23.700 --> 13:24.900
Okay.

13:25.700 --> 13:28.000
No, no, no, no,
I'm not hanging up.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.000
Computer company from hell.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.700
I've been on hold
a half an hour.

13:31.800 --> 13:34.700
I sent my kid's computer in to
get fixed, and they lost it.

13:35.100 --> 13:37.000
I told you those
gizmos were trouble.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.300
You talk to the Albany police?

13:38.400 --> 13:42.100
Yeah, she filed a complaint. Said he
followed her, waited outside her apartment.

13:42.200 --> 13:43.300
But without any proof...

13:43.400 --> 13:44.400
They did nothing.

13:44.500 --> 13:47.300
Her bad luck he didn't beat the crap
out of her in front of witnesses.

13:47.300 --> 13:48.400
Check this out.

13:48.500 --> 13:52.500
DMV records show Taylor was pulled
over a year ago, DWI, in Loudonville,

13:52.600 --> 13:53.700
just outside Albany.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.500
Loudonville, isn't
that where she lived?

13:55.600 --> 13:57.100
Could've been cruising
her neighborhood.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.400
Call Albany. Check
on the disposition.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.800
No, you don't want
me to come down there.

14:02.300 --> 14:05.900
Taylor said he had dinner at a friend's house.
Charges dismissed.

14:05.900 --> 14:07.500
His lawyer argued the
glass of wine he drank

14:07.500 --> 14:09.300
interacted with the
medication he'd taken.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.000
Let me guess,
he ate a breath mint.

14:11.100 --> 14:14.000
He has a bad back from a
skiing accident in college.

14:14.100 --> 14:15.600
He's been on pain
killers ever since.

14:15.700 --> 14:17.200
One more guess, Demerol?

14:17.300 --> 14:19.600
It doesn't say.
(PAGER BEEPING)

14:20.800 --> 14:22.800
It's Medill in Forensics.

14:23.200 --> 14:26.200
We found one pubic hair
that didn't belong to her.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.700
There's no root, you
can forget about DNA.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.800
Next time, we'll take our
bad news over the phone.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.700
Well, there is some good news.

14:32.800 --> 14:36.100
Two drops of seminal fluid on the top sheet.
Very small drops.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.600
Tadpoles in the fluid?

14:38.000 --> 14:39.500
Well, enough for a sample.

14:39.500 --> 14:43.300
There's also a drop in the
carpeting next to the bed.

14:43.400 --> 14:46.600
Drop here, a drop there The guy
tried to clean up after himself?

14:46.900 --> 14:48.900
No, there was spermicide
in the fluid.

14:48.900 --> 14:50.400
More likely he used a condom,

14:50.400 --> 14:52.600
then had some spill
off when he removed it.

14:54.500 --> 14:57.400
You take his blood, you let him
stew in jail for two days,

14:57.300 --> 14:59.200
if you don't bring him up for
arraignment by tonight...

14:59.300 --> 15:01.200
Three years I've put up with
this campaign of harassment.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.400
When does it stop?

15:02.500 --> 15:03.900
It's up to you.
It can end right now.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.200
How? By telling you
what you want to hear?

15:06.300 --> 15:07.400
Is that what you'd like?

15:07.400 --> 15:10.000
Oh, you don't want to know
what I'd like right now.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.800
Are you trying to
provoke me, is that it?

15:11.900 --> 15:14.700
We don't want to do that. We
need you calm and focused.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.800
We've got a lot
of ground to cover.

15:16.900 --> 15:18.300
Okay, okay.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.800
Let's start with
this DWI in Albany.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.500
In Cecilia's neighborhood.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.900
I was nowhere near her.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.300
You were drunk,
you might not remember.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.300
I was not drunk.
I take painkillers.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.700
Scotch always killed my pain.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.700
For my back.
I take Demerol.

15:39.500 --> 15:40.700
Demerol.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.400
Your fiancée is a
doctor, is that right?

15:46.000 --> 15:47.900
An oncologist. What
does that have to do...

15:47.900 --> 15:50.700
In her office, she keeps swabs,
syringes, things like that.

15:51.600 --> 15:52.800
Yes, of course.

15:55.900 --> 15:57.100
What're you writing?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.800
You and your fiancée
use condoms?

16:00.300 --> 16:02.300
What the hell? He's not
going to answer that.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.600
Isn't he curious as
to why we're asking?

16:06.100 --> 16:07.600
Yes, I am.

16:07.900 --> 16:10.400
Whoever raped Cecilia
used a condom.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.400
Except some of his little
guys got away from him.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.600
Like on the rug, on the bed.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.900
That's why we took
your blood, Taylor.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.400
That doesn't
concern me one bit.

16:21.100 --> 16:22.800
We're giving you
the straight dope.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.100
Let's move on.
(DOOR OPENING)

16:25.600 --> 16:27.300
Sorry to interrupt.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.900
We have the blood
test results, Mr. Taylor.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.300
Your DNA matches what
we found at the scene.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.400
Boo! You should've
been a little more careful

16:34.500 --> 16:36.000
when you took
off your party hat.

16:36.300 --> 16:37.500
It's not possible.

16:37.500 --> 16:40.400
O.J. or no O.J.,
DNA don't lie, my man.

16:40.900 --> 16:43.200
Would you like to make a statement
at this time, Mr. Taylor?

16:44.000 --> 16:46.200
It is not possible!

16:46.400 --> 16:47.900
I'll take that as a no.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.400
Mr. Garnett, I've notified
the D.A.'s office.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.600
We're ready to take your
client over for arraignment.

16:52.600 --> 16:56.900
This can't be happening.
Charles, do something!

16:57.000 --> 16:59.500
Yeah, Counselor, why don't you
click your heels three times

16:59.500 --> 17:01.700
and say, "There's
no place like home"?

17:07.900 --> 17:09.800
CARMICHAEL: You plead to the
assault on Ms. Knowles.

17:09.900 --> 17:11.400
You plead to the
murder of her sister.

17:11.500 --> 17:14.300
You serve concurrent
sentences of 25-to-life.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.400
JACK: Two
for one, Mr. Taylor.

17:16.500 --> 17:17.800
This is why we're here?

17:17.900 --> 17:21.400
The rape and attempted murder
alone will get you 25 years.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.200
In the meantime,

17:23.200 --> 17:26.700
the police would continue to
investigate Julie Gorham's murder.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.100
They turn up anything, you'd
face another 25 years.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.900
You'd be 80 before
you saw daylight.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
But I'm innocent.

17:32.100 --> 17:34.800
Ken, we don't have to give
them an answer right away.

17:35.700 --> 17:37.100
I don't have to think about it.

17:37.100 --> 17:39.900
I spent two days in prison before I got bail.
I'm not going back.

17:39.900 --> 17:42.500
Mr. Taylor, once you're
indicted, it's too late.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.200
Oh, to hell with this. You deal with them.
I'll be downstairs.

17:46.300 --> 17:47.400
Ken...

17:49.800 --> 17:53.500
Mr. Garnett, if you haven't explained
the facts of life to your client...

17:53.600 --> 17:55.100
I had the talk with him.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.400
But he tells me he's innocent.
What am I supposed to do?

17:57.500 --> 17:59.000
When are you presenting
to the grand jury?

17:59.000 --> 18:00.100
CARMICHAEL:
Day after tomorrow.

18:00.100 --> 18:01.300
He wants to talk to them.

18:02.100 --> 18:04.300
About what? His
political connections?

18:06.500 --> 18:09.300
He'll sign the waiver of
immunity whenever it's ready.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.300
KEN: Ms. Knowles was convinced
I killed her sister.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.300
Of course I was
the obvious suspect.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.500
The police investigated
me thoroughly.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.600
They searched my hotel
room in New York,

18:21.600 --> 18:23.400
they searched
my home in Albany.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.700
They searched my parents'
home, my brother's boat,

18:25.700 --> 18:27.700
his home, our cars.

18:28.100 --> 18:30.700
But they didn't find one
shred of evidence. Not one.

18:31.700 --> 18:34.300
But that didn't change
Ms. Knowles' mind.

18:34.300 --> 18:35.900
She just kept on after me.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.200
I think she'd do
anything to harm me.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.700
JACK: Even put
herself in a coma?

18:41.800 --> 18:43.900
I'm sure she didn't plan
on ending up in a coma.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.700
But she staged this assault.
There's no other explanation.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.200
She lied to the police
about you harassing her?

18:49.500 --> 18:53.300
Yes. I never harassed her. I never called her.
I never followed her.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.500
You moved to New York City
one month after she did.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.000
That's a coincidence.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.900
JACK: It's also a coincidence that
Ms. Knowles was injected with Demerol?

19:02.400 --> 19:04.900
Julie knew I took Demerol.
I'm sure she told Cecilia.

19:04.900 --> 19:06.600
And Cecilia injected herself.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.600
And the ligature marks and
the bruises on her thighs?

19:09.700 --> 19:11.100
They were
self-inflicted?

19:11.800 --> 19:13.000
They had to be.

19:13.700 --> 19:14.900
And the semen?

19:16.400 --> 19:19.900
Mr. Taylor, two laboratories
independently confirmed

19:20.200 --> 19:23.400
your DNA matched the semen
found at the scene.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.200
They must've made a mistake.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.500
Is that your best answer?

19:32.200 --> 19:33.400
No.

19:36.900 --> 19:38.100
(SIGHING)

19:38.200 --> 19:41.500
I had two sexual encounters the week
before Ms. Knowles was attacked.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.600
While your fiancée
was out of town?

19:43.600 --> 19:44.600
Yes.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.700
I met the women through an escort
service, Private Encounters.

19:48.700 --> 19:51.200
I saw one on Saturday, the
other one on Monday night.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.300
Are you suggesting
Ms. Knowles

19:53.400 --> 19:56.000
used a prostitute
to obtain your semen?

19:56.200 --> 19:57.500
She had to.

19:58.500 --> 20:03.200
Can you produce either of these
women to corroborate this theory?

20:04.200 --> 20:06.000
No. I don't know
their real names.

20:08.900 --> 20:10.900
This is a heck
of a story, Mr. Taylor.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.700
No wonder you were so anxious
to tell it to the grand jury.

20:15.400 --> 20:18.000
I came here because I
have nothing to hide.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.000
I admitted cheating
on my fiancée.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
An admission
without consequence,

20:22.000 --> 20:25.400
since, as I'm sure your
attorney explained to you,

20:25.400 --> 20:27.600
grand jury transcripts
are sealed.

20:28.700 --> 20:30.700
Do you think it's easy
for me to sit here

20:30.700 --> 20:31.900
in front of all these people?

20:34.900 --> 20:37.600
I think you lie as
effortlessly as I breathe.

20:38.200 --> 20:41.200
I am not lying!
I am being framed!

20:41.400 --> 20:42.800
By a woman in a coma?

20:42.800 --> 20:44.700
She's crazy. She was
obsessed with me.

20:44.700 --> 20:46.100
JACK: Mr. Taylor.

20:46.300 --> 20:48.400
Ask her friends. She was
even seeing a shrink.

20:48.500 --> 20:51.700
Mr. Taylor, your
statement is over.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.500
(BELL RINGING)

21:05.300 --> 21:08.300
Rape one, assault one,
attempted murder two.

21:08.300 --> 21:10.900
Round one to you.
See you in motions court.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.800
The tried and true, when you
have no case, file motions.

21:15.800 --> 21:17.500
Let's not be too smug.

21:17.900 --> 21:19.600
Taylor has two
potential witnesses

21:19.700 --> 21:21.900
who have a track record
of doing anything for money.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.100
The prostitutes?

21:23.100 --> 21:24.700
Shouldn't we find
them before he does?

21:24.700 --> 21:26.100
If they exist.

21:26.800 --> 21:28.600
Any mention he was a suspect

21:28.700 --> 21:31.100
in Julie Gorham's death
would be inflammatory.

21:31.100 --> 21:34.800
People v. Molineux, prior bad acts
are admissible to establish motive.

21:34.900 --> 21:38.000
The fact Cecilia Knowles blamed
him for her sister's death

21:38.100 --> 21:39.500
is the reason
he tried to kill her.

21:39.500 --> 21:40.800
Pure speculation.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.900
It's an issue of fact.

21:42.400 --> 21:45.000
I agree. The jury
can make the call.

21:45.400 --> 21:48.800
I'm going to let them hear about
Ms. Gorham's death. Next up.

21:49.800 --> 21:52.000
Speaking of prior bad acts,

21:52.200 --> 21:54.000
I want to present evidence
of gross negligence

21:54.100 --> 21:55.700
by the labs used
for DNA testing.

21:55.800 --> 21:58.500
Any problems at the labs have
long since been resolved.

21:58.500 --> 22:00.300
These incidents occurred
just two years ago.

22:00.500 --> 22:02.900
Oh, please! Motion denied.
What else?

22:07.300 --> 22:10.500
This so-called harassment
of Ms. Knowles.

22:10.600 --> 22:12.400
Ms. Knowles made a report
to the Albany police.

22:12.500 --> 22:13.700
Your Honor,

22:13.700 --> 22:15.900
how am I supposed to cross
examine a police report?

22:16.000 --> 22:17.400
JACK: Thanks to his client,
Ms. Knowles

22:17.500 --> 22:20.100
is unable to testify about the
terror he visited on her.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.900
This report is the
next best thing.

22:23.900 --> 22:25.400
As long as he
can authenticate it,

22:25.400 --> 22:27.200
I don't see a problem
here, Mr. Garnett.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.300
Motion denied again.
Next item.

22:30.300 --> 22:31.900
That's it. I have
no more motions.

22:33.100 --> 22:36.100
Then we're done. I'll see
you gentleman at trial.

22:36.100 --> 22:37.300
(SIGHING)

22:38.700 --> 22:41.400
ED: It took some doing, but we found
the guy that runs the escort service.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.200
He's cooperating?
Oh, we're nominating him

22:43.300 --> 22:44.800
for Citizen of the Year.

22:44.900 --> 22:48.100
Taylor put his horizontal hula
classes on his credit card.

22:48.100 --> 22:51.000
There's a charge for the Saturday
before Knowles was attacked.

22:50.900 --> 22:53.000
We talked to the girl. She
met Taylor at his place

22:53.100 --> 22:54.300
at 3:00 o'clock
in the afternoon.

22:54.300 --> 22:56.000
At 5:00, she was
on a plane out of Newark.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.400
She went to Vegas to work
a garment convention.

22:58.400 --> 23:00.500
She didn't return until
the following weekend.

23:00.600 --> 23:02.000
What about Miss Monday Night?

23:02.100 --> 23:03.800
There's no record
Taylor had a date.

23:03.900 --> 23:06.900
He could've paid cash, but the
service would have a booking slip.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.100
Doesn't make sense he'd lie about
this one and not the other.

23:09.200 --> 23:12.200
Our Citizen of the Year's arranging
for us to talk to the booker,

23:12.200 --> 23:13.900
the girl who handled
the phones that Monday.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.100
Good. As soon as you
know anything...

23:16.100 --> 23:18.800
You don't actually swallow
Taylor's cock and bull story.

23:18.900 --> 23:21.600
It's a matter of what he
can get a jury to swallow.

23:21.700 --> 23:23.300
His lawyer wants to
meet with us tomorrow.

23:23.300 --> 23:25.600
If you hear anything
by then, let me know.

23:29.100 --> 23:32.500
It's become obvious to us
that no matter how unjust,

23:33.200 --> 23:35.800
we have no hope
of prevailing at trial.

23:36.100 --> 23:38.400
So, we'd like to talk
about a plea bargain.

23:38.500 --> 23:39.700
You know our terms.

23:39.800 --> 23:43.600
They're unacceptable. We might as
well take our chances with a jury.

23:43.500 --> 23:46.300
We're prepared
to accept 15-to-25

23:46.300 --> 23:48.400
on a plea to the assault
on Ms. Knowles.

23:48.400 --> 23:50.900
We're not admitting anything
on the Gorham murder.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Fifteen years, he'll be out,
and Ms. Knowles most likely

23:53.000 --> 23:54.500
will still be in a coma.

23:54.600 --> 23:57.700
I know what judges have been handing
out for this kind of offense.

23:57.800 --> 23:59.600
Fifteen years is well
within the ballpark.

23:59.700 --> 24:02.200
I talked to Ms. Knowles'
social worker.

24:02.200 --> 24:03.600
At the present
standard of care,

24:03.700 --> 24:06.200
she'll exhaust her medical
insurance in two years.

24:06.200 --> 24:08.500
After that, things
get very bleak.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.400
All right, what do you want?

24:12.500 --> 24:15.500
He forfeits all his assets to
cover her medical expenses.

24:15.600 --> 24:18.400
Anything beyond that comes
out of his future earnings.

24:18.400 --> 24:19.600
Oh.

24:19.800 --> 24:20.900
That's the deal.

24:20.900 --> 24:22.800
It's outrageous!
Ken, wait.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.700
All right, let's
split the difference.

24:25.700 --> 24:27.900
The minimum sentence here
is 12 and a half years.

24:27.900 --> 24:30.600
He does that, plus
the medical expenses. Okay?

24:35.900 --> 24:39.800
Ken, it doesn't mean we'll stop
trying to prove your innocence.

24:42.600 --> 24:43.700
Okay.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.600
CHARLES: Send
us the paperwork.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.900
I want all his financials
by the end of the week.

24:57.100 --> 25:00.100
We didn't tell them the cops are
talking to the escort service.

25:00.200 --> 25:02.800
We're under no obligation.
It isn't exculpatory.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.900
It isn't up to us
to do their work for 'em.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.400
We don't know
what they'll find.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.200
(SIGHING)

25:10.900 --> 25:12.700
Abbie, he confessed.

25:13.700 --> 25:14.800
Case over.

25:15.400 --> 25:17.200
You count it as a touchdown.

25:17.300 --> 25:19.300
I'll wait for
the instant replay.

25:24.200 --> 25:26.400
I can't believe the
service gave you my name.

25:26.500 --> 25:28.600
They tell you all I do
is answer their phones?

25:28.500 --> 25:29.800
And book the appointments.

25:29.900 --> 25:31.800
Okay, sure, I do that.

25:31.900 --> 25:34.500
So, you want me to give the
money back or something?

25:34.600 --> 25:38.000
Somebody we're looking at claims he got
a girl from your service last month.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
On the night of the
12th, a Monday.

25:40.300 --> 25:41.700
Every call gets a booking slip.

25:41.800 --> 25:44.200
CARMICHAEL: This one didn't.
The name's Ken Taylor.

25:44.300 --> 25:46.600
On 57th. He's booked
with you before.

25:46.900 --> 25:49.200
We get a hundred calls a night.

25:49.300 --> 25:52.500
The author wants portly pandas.
They look portly to you?

25:52.700 --> 25:54.200
What's the deal, Michelle?

25:54.200 --> 25:56.700
You make appointments off the books,
split the cash with the girls?

25:57.700 --> 25:59.200
I got a deadline here.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
We know Taylor called
the service that night.

26:02.100 --> 26:03.800
We can show you
the phone records.

26:03.800 --> 26:05.400
We can send a copy to
your boss, if you'd like.

26:06.900 --> 26:08.200
Please don't do that.

26:08.700 --> 26:10.000
I need the job.

26:10.100 --> 26:11.300
Then play ball.

26:13.600 --> 26:15.700
This girl I know, Tina,

26:16.100 --> 26:18.900
she called me asking if
Taylor ever booked with us.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.900
I told her, "Sure."
She say why?

26:20.900 --> 26:22.200
She said he owed her money.

26:22.300 --> 26:23.400
You have Tina's number?

26:23.900 --> 26:26.100
She had a pager
but it got disconnected.

26:26.600 --> 26:29.000
How else will we find her?
Through another service?

26:29.400 --> 26:32.100
No. She finds
clients at the hotels.

26:32.300 --> 26:35.300
I know she spends a lot of time
in the bar at the Swanson.

26:36.600 --> 26:40.200
The bartender at the Swanson told us
you're there at least three nights a week.

26:40.300 --> 26:42.900
Ms. Knowles was there
the night she was attacked.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.500
The night after
you saw Ken Taylor.

26:45.900 --> 26:47.100
I don't know Ken.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.200
ED: Oh, I'd bet
he remembers you.

26:49.300 --> 26:51.900
We put you in a line up, even
blindfolded he'd pick you out.

26:54.300 --> 26:56.000
So, the way to go here,

26:56.500 --> 26:58.700
is nice and easy.

27:02.700 --> 27:05.400
Okay, we go that way.

27:07.400 --> 27:08.600
What kind of charges?

27:08.700 --> 27:10.600
Don't cooperate,
and you'll find out.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.300
(SIGHING)

27:15.700 --> 27:17.200
Cecilia approached me

27:17.600 --> 27:20.400
at the Swanson,
a couple of weeks before.

27:21.900 --> 27:23.700
I wasn't the first girl
that she'd talked to.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.400
She told me that this guy,
Taylor, had been bothering her.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.800
And that she wanted
to get something on him.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.600
She knew he called the escorts.

27:33.800 --> 27:35.800
She said she'd pay me
to find out which service.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.000
Is this something
you've done before?

27:38.500 --> 27:40.400
(SIGHS) No.

27:42.100 --> 27:46.400
But I know girls who've done
it, for wives, girlfriends.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.500
I called some
bookers that I knew.

27:50.500 --> 27:53.000
I got the information
Cecilia wanted.

27:53.100 --> 27:56.100
And then she offered me more
money to arrange to meet him.

27:56.200 --> 27:57.900
ED: And to get
a semen sample?

27:59.500 --> 28:00.600
Yeah.

28:01.500 --> 28:03.600
I made sure he used a condom.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.600
And I gave it
to her the next day.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.600
Did she say what she
was gonna do with it?

28:10.900 --> 28:13.500
She told me Taylor
killed her sister.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.300
She said she was gonna
make him pay for it.

28:29.900 --> 28:31.800
She got wind he was
moving to New York

28:31.800 --> 28:35.000
when his office sent a housing
request to the travel division.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.500
It gave her time to sign
a lease before he did.

28:37.600 --> 28:40.100
So, this harassment
was a work of fiction.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.400
Along with everything else.

28:42.500 --> 28:45.500
One of her co-workers at the
travel agency takes Demerol.

28:45.600 --> 28:48.600
The only thing she didn't count
on was the allergic reaction.

28:49.400 --> 28:50.900
Have we told
Mr. Taylor?

28:51.000 --> 28:52.500
CARMICHAEL:
We told his lawyer.

28:52.500 --> 28:53.800
(SIGHING)

28:54.200 --> 28:57.900
Well, you got an innocent man to
confess to a crime he didn't commit.

28:59.400 --> 29:02.000
Maybe this job's getting
too easy for you.

29:05.400 --> 29:06.800
I know. I know.

29:07.100 --> 29:09.800
I was going to say I'll get
started on the dismissal notice.

29:12.800 --> 29:15.400
A man so self-absorbed,
so arrogant.

29:20.400 --> 29:23.100
It never occurred to me
he might be innocent.

29:23.200 --> 29:25.900
Or that Cecilia Knowles
might be so desperate.

29:25.800 --> 29:28.700
Ninety percent of cases
are circumstantial.

29:29.600 --> 29:32.500
We can only go where the
best evidence leads us.

29:32.600 --> 29:35.500
And if we stumble across
justice along the way, great.

29:36.200 --> 29:38.600
You see Julie Gorham's
file on the table?

29:38.600 --> 29:39.800
Yes.

29:39.800 --> 29:41.400
Look in the search inventory.

29:41.800 --> 29:45.000
A barn on 5 acres of
farmland in Schoharie County

29:45.000 --> 29:47.100
belonging to the Taylor family.

29:48.700 --> 29:50.500
No barn, no farmland.

29:50.400 --> 29:51.800
It was on the list of assets

29:51.800 --> 29:53.700
Taylor sent over
for the plea bargain.

29:53.800 --> 29:56.800
Jack, they searched
every piece of property

29:56.800 --> 29:59.900
Taylor and his family
owned to find Gorham's body.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.700
Why didn't they
search this barn?

30:01.800 --> 30:03.100
Maybe he bought it recently.

30:03.200 --> 30:05.100
Let's have the police
look into it.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.200
BRISCOE: Taylor's old
man was a lawyer.

30:14.300 --> 30:18.000
A client gave him the barn six
years ago as payment for services.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.700
But the title was never transferred
until after the old man died last year.

30:21.700 --> 30:24.400
Well, maybe Taylor wasn't aware
his father owned it until then.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.200
Well, Ma and Pa
Kettle next door

30:26.200 --> 30:29.300
remember Taylor and his dad
being out here five years ago.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.200
It's over here.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.100
She's in some
kind of canvas bag.

30:38.700 --> 30:40.600
CARMICHAEL: We have
a manner of death?

30:40.600 --> 30:43.100
ED: Skull's crushed
in on the left side.

30:43.100 --> 30:44.900
BRISCOE: What's
that label say?

30:46.900 --> 30:49.200
Marine Plus.
Could be a sail bag.

30:51.500 --> 30:54.400
Taylor's brother keeps a
boat for City Marina.

30:56.200 --> 30:58.100
These are dirt marks
on the sail bag

30:58.200 --> 31:00.600
that held the remains
of Julie Gorham.

31:01.400 --> 31:05.300
This is a section of the
deck of your brother's boat.

31:05.400 --> 31:09.000
The characteristics of the non-skid
pattern are uniquely consistent

31:09.000 --> 31:10.600
with the marks on the sail bag.

31:11.200 --> 31:14.900
The only patterns that matter
are my client's fingerprints.

31:15.100 --> 31:17.300
Which I assume you didn't find.

31:17.700 --> 31:20.600
We were wrong once, Mr. Garnett.
We're not wrong this time.

31:20.700 --> 31:22.300
KEN: Why are you
doing this to me?

31:22.500 --> 31:26.800
I didn't kill Julie. It's Cecilia.
It's all Cecilia!

31:27.800 --> 31:30.000
I guess that means we can
forget about a plea.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.100
I don't make the same
mistakes twice either.

31:33.100 --> 31:35.700
I'm going to enjoy putting
your client in jail.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.600
Blame the woman in a coma.
Hell of a strategy.

31:40.600 --> 31:41.800
What a weasel.
Yeah,

31:41.900 --> 31:43.600
and the jury better
not hear about it.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.000
It's absurd.

31:45.400 --> 31:49.800
And so is hiring a prostitute to
extract evidence from Mr. Taylor.

31:50.200 --> 31:53.800
From Taylor's lawyer. He wants
Cecilia's psychiatric records.

31:53.900 --> 31:55.100
Uh-huh.

31:56.900 --> 31:58.300
Ms. Knowles had been
seeing her shrink

31:58.400 --> 32:00.300
for seven years before
moving to the city.

32:00.300 --> 32:03.300
I believe those records contain evidence
of her obsession with my client,

32:03.300 --> 32:05.400
and of her culpability
in the death of her sister.

32:05.500 --> 32:07.800
She was obsessed with him
because he killed her sister.

32:07.900 --> 32:10.200
Her obsession with him
predates her sister's death.

32:10.300 --> 32:12.400
Your Honor, he thinks he
can say anything he wants

32:12.500 --> 32:14.200
because Ms. Knowles isn't
here to defend herself.

32:14.300 --> 32:17.300
That's why I'm here. Mr. Garnett,
those records are privileged,

32:17.400 --> 32:19.900
unless Ms. Knowles or her
legal guardian waives it.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.300
There's no legal guardian.

32:21.400 --> 32:24.100
She's in a coma, with little
hope of regaining consciousness.

32:24.200 --> 32:26.100
I mean, what am
I supposed to do?

32:26.200 --> 32:28.700
Without those records, my
client is swinging in the wind.

32:28.700 --> 32:30.700
Sorry, Mr. Garnett. You
can't have the records.

32:30.700 --> 32:32.200
All right, Your Honor.

32:33.300 --> 32:35.200
Then I want to present
evidence Ms. Knowles

32:35.200 --> 32:37.100
tried to frame my client
for attempted murder.

32:37.100 --> 32:39.800
Fine, then I'll present the jury with
Mr. Taylor's offer to plead guilty.

32:39.800 --> 32:43.300
And neither of you will present anything
about those incidents to the jury.

32:43.500 --> 32:44.900
Your Honor, you're
denying my client

32:44.900 --> 32:47.400
the right to offer an alternate
theory of the crime?

32:47.700 --> 32:50.700
You can present your theory.
Just not with this evidence.

32:57.700 --> 32:59.600
O'MALLEY: Except for a call
from his hotel room

32:59.700 --> 33:01.500
to the airline
at half past midnight,

33:01.600 --> 33:04.100
we couldn't verify the
whereabouts of Mr. Taylor

33:04.100 --> 33:08.000
from the time Ms. Gorham's plane
landed in LaGuardia at 9:00 p.m.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.900
until 7:30
the next morning.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.500
We did establish he had a
rental car at his disposal.

33:13.300 --> 33:15.900
What theory did you form as to
Ms. Gorham's disappearance?

33:17.200 --> 33:20.300
Mr. Taylor picked her up at the airport.
They had an argument,

33:20.400 --> 33:23.000
possibly over her decision
to break up with him.

33:23.100 --> 33:26.100
Mr. Taylor killed Ms. Gorham,
drove to the hotel

33:26.200 --> 33:28.500
to call the airline
to establish an alibi.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.800
He got a sail bag
from his brother's boat

33:30.800 --> 33:34.000
and buried her in the bag
in his barn upstate.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.200
Thank you.

33:40.200 --> 33:44.000
Detective, did any witness
positively identify

33:44.500 --> 33:46.600
Ms. Gorham on the
flight from Albany?

33:46.900 --> 33:48.400
Positively? No.

33:48.400 --> 33:49.900
But her boarding pass was used.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.400
The stewardess saw a woman
occupying her seat.

33:52.600 --> 33:57.300
Do you know how Ms. Gorham got from
her home to the Albany airport?

33:57.900 --> 33:59.100
O'MALLEY: We assume
she took a cab.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.300
Did you find
the cab that drove her?

34:02.000 --> 34:03.100
No.

34:03.600 --> 34:04.800
Hmm.

34:07.600 --> 34:10.400
Who told you that Ms. Gorham decided
to break up with my client?

34:11.400 --> 34:12.900
Her sister, Cecilia Knowles.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.400
But we had other witnesses
who saw your client

34:15.400 --> 34:17.199
and Ms. Gorham
fighting in public.

34:17.300 --> 34:19.600
Did you verify Ms. Knowles'
whereabouts that night?

34:20.600 --> 34:22.400
She said she was
at home in Albany.

34:22.500 --> 34:24.400
We didn't verify it.
She wasn't a suspect.

34:24.500 --> 34:26.800
Isn't it possible she drove
her sister to the airport?

34:27.600 --> 34:28.800
I suppose.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.800
Isn't it possible she got on
the plane, and not her sister?

34:33.100 --> 34:35.199
Anything's possible. I don't
see what you're getting at.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.199
What I'm getting at

34:38.100 --> 34:40.000
is Ms. Knowles
killed her sister

34:40.100 --> 34:42.199
on the way
to the Albany airport,

34:42.300 --> 34:44.100
left the body in her car,

34:44.100 --> 34:46.000
and then flew to New
York in her place.

34:47.500 --> 34:48.699
Isn't that possible?

34:49.800 --> 34:53.199
No. It isn't. Because your
client killed Julie Gorham.

34:53.600 --> 34:55.900
You never searched
Ms. Knowles' car, did you?

34:57.800 --> 34:58.900
No.

35:00.900 --> 35:04.200
Defense 12, from the
Department of Motor Vehicles.

35:04.700 --> 35:07.000
Would it surprise you
she traded her car in

35:06.900 --> 35:08.700
one month after
her sister's murder?

35:08.800 --> 35:10.600
Objection. This is
irrelevant and inflammatory.

35:10.700 --> 35:12.400
It's evidence.
JUDGE: Approach.

35:13.200 --> 35:16.000
The fact that Ms. Knowles got rid
of her car doesn't prove anything.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.700
There are dozens
of possible reasons.

35:17.700 --> 35:20.300
And I have an absolute right to
present my reasons to the jury.

35:20.400 --> 35:23.400
He's taking advantage of the fact
Ms. Knowles can't explain her actions.

35:23.400 --> 35:26.200
This is exactly the sort of thing
we asked Your Honor to prevent.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.800
The jurors aren't
babies, Mr. McCoy.

35:29.300 --> 35:32.800
They can decide whether to accept
or reject Mr. Garnett's theories.

35:33.400 --> 35:35.100
Objection overruled.

35:37.900 --> 35:42.100
Every time my brother was in town, Kenny
would bring Julie down to the boat.

35:42.600 --> 35:43.900
A few times
they brought Cecilia.

35:44.500 --> 35:46.300
They were trying
to fix me up with her.

35:46.700 --> 35:49.900
One time I asked her to come sailing with me.
Just the two of us.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.300
CHARLES: How
did she respond?

35:51.400 --> 35:52.600
Objection. Hearsay.

35:52.800 --> 35:54.900
Res gestae, Your Honor.
It's foundational.

35:56.400 --> 35:59.400
I'll allow it. Answer
his question, Mr. Taylor.

36:00.100 --> 36:02.400
She said she wasn't
interested in me that way.

36:02.500 --> 36:03.700
That she had her eye on Kenny.

36:04.700 --> 36:06.400
Did you tell your brother?

36:06.500 --> 36:09.700
No. I didn't want to cause
him any problems with Julie.

36:09.700 --> 36:11.300
Did you and your
brother ever mention

36:11.400 --> 36:14.100
your father's barn
in Ms. Gorham's presence?

36:14.500 --> 36:16.200
Yes, a few times.

36:16.300 --> 36:19.700
We talked about buying the land next
door and building a country house.

36:19.700 --> 36:22.200
Did you ever talk about it
in front of Ms. Knowles?

36:23.300 --> 36:24.900
I mentioned our plans, yes.

36:26.500 --> 36:27.800
No more questions.

36:31.900 --> 36:35.100
You love your kid brother very
much, don't you, Mr. Taylor?

36:35.400 --> 36:36.700
Yes.

36:36.800 --> 36:40.000
I'm sure he feels very
kindly toward you right now.

36:40.400 --> 36:41.800
When Ms. Gorham
disappeared,

36:42.100 --> 36:45.500
did you mention Ms. Knowles' feeling
toward your brother to the police?

36:46.600 --> 36:48.300
No. It didn't
seem relevant.

36:48.800 --> 36:50.200
But it seems relevant now?

36:51.600 --> 36:53.300
Yes.
Because it suggests

36:53.300 --> 36:55.600
someone else had a reason
to kill Ms. Gorham?

36:56.900 --> 36:58.000
Yes.

36:58.300 --> 37:01.000
Someone other than the kid
brother you love very much.

37:01.300 --> 37:02.600
Withdrawn.

37:07.500 --> 37:10.000
I'm not sure I understand
your question.

37:10.600 --> 37:14.200
I mean, my own sisters and I
don't always see eye to eye.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.300
It doesn't mean anything.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.300
Your Honor, request permission
to treat as hostile.

37:19.700 --> 37:20.900
Go ahead.

37:21.100 --> 37:23.300
Ms. Wehner,
weren't you present

37:23.400 --> 37:25.400
during an argument between
Ms. Knowles and her sister,

37:25.500 --> 37:27.900
two weeks before
Ms. Gorham's disappearance?

37:28.200 --> 37:29.300
Yes.

37:29.400 --> 37:31.800
And wasn't the argument over
Ms. Gorham's relationship

37:31.800 --> 37:33.300
with my client?
Yes.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.500
And didn't Ms. Knowles
express the opinion

37:35.500 --> 37:38.800
that my client was the
wrong man for Ms. Gorham?

37:38.800 --> 37:40.700
Yes. And he was.

37:41.300 --> 37:44.000
I didn't ask for your
opinion, Ms. Wehner.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.800
Seven years ago,

37:48.800 --> 37:51.700
wasn't there an incident
between Ms. Knowles

37:51.800 --> 37:54.500
and a married
co-worker in your office?

37:55.300 --> 37:56.700
Yes, but...

37:56.700 --> 38:00.000
She made unwanted advances to him,
sent him inappropriate letters.

38:00.100 --> 38:01.300
Objection. Relevance.

38:02.300 --> 38:05.700
Overruled. Answer
the question, Ms. Wehner.

38:08.300 --> 38:10.500
Yes, she did that.

38:10.500 --> 38:12.300
And after this man
complained to you,

38:12.300 --> 38:14.800
you had a conversation with Ms. Knowles.
What'd you tell her?

38:17.600 --> 38:19.900
I told her she should
see a therapist.

38:20.500 --> 38:21.700
Thank you.

38:28.600 --> 38:32.000
To your knowledge, did Cecilia
ever hurt or threaten her sister?

38:32.100 --> 38:33.300
No.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.500
Julie was everything
to Cecilia.

38:36.600 --> 38:38.600
Ever since their parents died.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Cecilia worked
to support Julie,

38:41.100 --> 38:43.500
to pay for her
college, her books.

38:44.900 --> 38:47.200
She sacrificed so much for her.

38:50.100 --> 38:53.100
Mr. McCoy wants you to put
your brains on auto pilot,

38:53.200 --> 38:56.100
to blindly accept
that of course

38:56.200 --> 38:58.200
Ken Taylor had a bad temper,

38:58.300 --> 39:00.400
of course Julie was
breaking up with him,

39:00.500 --> 39:03.500
of course she landed
at LaGuardia,

39:03.400 --> 39:04.600
of course

39:05.900 --> 39:07.100
he killed her

39:07.100 --> 39:08.800
and dumped her body in his barn.

39:08.900 --> 39:10.700
Of course, of course.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.700
Mr. McCoy

39:13.800 --> 39:15.100
doesn't want you
to concern yourself

39:15.200 --> 39:17.700
with another perfectly
reasonable theory.

39:17.700 --> 39:22.100
That it was Cecilia Knowles who
was jealous of Julie Gorham,

39:22.100 --> 39:23.700
who killed her, took her
place on the plane.

39:23.800 --> 39:25.300
Took the sail bag from the boat

39:25.400 --> 39:27.800
and buried her
in Mr. Taylor's barn.

39:27.900 --> 39:29.500
And Cecilia did this

39:29.900 --> 39:32.400
because she was obsessed

39:33.500 --> 39:34.700
with my client.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.900
She wanted to possess him.
Control him.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.500
Where's the proof?

39:41.300 --> 39:43.800
I wanted you to hear what
she told her therapist

39:43.900 --> 39:46.200
but Mr. McCoy had those
records suppressed.

39:46.300 --> 39:48.300
Objection. Facts
not in evidence.

39:48.600 --> 39:51.400
Mr. Garnett, you've made your point.
Move on.

39:52.500 --> 39:56.700
Cecilia Knowles set out to frame my client.
And it worked.

39:56.700 --> 39:57.900
She fooled Mr. McCoy.

39:57.900 --> 40:00.500
He's as much a victim of her
machinations as my client.

40:00.500 --> 40:01.700
Your Honor.

40:01.700 --> 40:04.400
It's summation, Mr. McCoy. He's
allowed to argue his case.

40:05.300 --> 40:06.400
Goon.

40:07.500 --> 40:10.200
Ladies and gentlemen,
this isn't the first time

40:10.300 --> 40:12.600
Mr. McCoy has been fooled
by Cecilia Knowles.

40:12.700 --> 40:14.800
He doesn't want you to know,
but she's done this before.

40:14.900 --> 40:16.700
Objection. Facts
not in evidence.

40:16.800 --> 40:19.300
Sustained. Wrap it up,
Mr. Garnett.

40:19.300 --> 40:21.200
That's not good enough.
Side bar, Your Honor.

40:21.200 --> 40:23.500
Denied. Mr. Garnett.

40:23.800 --> 40:26.000
He's bringing up
facts not adduced at trial.

40:26.100 --> 40:28.200
I want Your Honor
to instruct the jury to...

40:28.300 --> 40:30.000
Sit down, Mr. McCoy.

40:30.100 --> 40:32.300
Your Honor made rulings.
The People relied on them.

40:32.600 --> 40:34.700
I want his summation
stricken from the record.

40:34.800 --> 40:35.900
I'll do no such thing.

40:35.900 --> 40:37.900
Your Honor, you're leaving
us with no remedy.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.600
If you won't uphold
your own rulings...

40:39.600 --> 40:41.600
Be quiet, Mr. McCoy.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.200
Now, sit down.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.200
So,

40:54.900 --> 40:56.900
even if you don't believe

40:57.200 --> 40:59.800
Cecilia Knowles
killed her own sister,

41:01.200 --> 41:03.700
you must admit
it's possible she did.

41:05.800 --> 41:07.700
And that's reasonable doubt.

41:25.900 --> 41:28.200
Cecilia Knowles
isn't here today

41:28.300 --> 41:31.000
because, as you know,
she's in a coma.

41:32.400 --> 41:34.800
You haven't been told
why she's in a coma.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.500
Mr. Garnett alluded
to the reason.

41:37.900 --> 41:39.400
I'm going to tell you why.

41:39.400 --> 41:40.900
Objection.
She did it

41:41.600 --> 41:43.600
in a desperate,
crazed attempt...

41:43.900 --> 41:45.300
Sustained.
...to call attention

41:45.300 --> 41:47.300
to the fact
that Mr. Taylor

41:47.400 --> 41:49.800
had gotten away with the
murder of her sister.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.700
I said sustained,
Mr. McCoy.

41:53.700 --> 41:55.900
She was so convinced
of his guilt,

41:56.000 --> 41:58.500
she was ready to put
herself in jeopardy

41:58.600 --> 42:00.900
to see this vicious
killer brought to trial.

42:00.900 --> 42:03.000
(STERNLY) Mr. McCoy.
And while she lies

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
in a hospital bed,
this court has seen fit

42:06.000 --> 42:09.000
to allow the defense to speculate
about her state of mind!

42:08.900 --> 42:10.100
That's enough.

42:10.200 --> 42:12.600
And hold her up as a
patsy for Mr. Taylor.

42:13.200 --> 42:14.600
And since this court

42:14.700 --> 42:17.200
doesn't have the guts
to protect the rights

42:17.200 --> 42:19.000
of the weak and voiceless...
(JUDGE POUNDS GAVEL)

42:19.000 --> 42:20.500
You're in contempt,
Mr. McCoy.

42:20.600 --> 42:23.900
...It's for the jury
to see justice done.

42:24.400 --> 42:26.900
And justice in this case

42:27.000 --> 42:30.900
is holding Ken Taylor, and only Ken
Taylor, responsible for the death

42:30.900 --> 42:32.800
of Julie Gorham. (POUNDING
GAVEL) That's it.

42:32.900 --> 42:34.500
I am declaring
an immediate mistrial.

42:34.400 --> 42:35.500
Oh, Your Honor...

42:35.600 --> 42:38.200
Sit down, Mr. Garnett You
opened the door for this.

42:41.600 --> 42:44.100
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're dismissed.

42:44.300 --> 42:47.200
With my apologies
on behalf of counsel.

42:48.600 --> 42:50.200
We're adjourned.
(POUNDS GAVEL)

43:10.000 --> 43:11.700
(BEEPING)

43:22.600 --> 43:25.000
CARMICHAEL: Your assistant
said you were here.

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
I had to sign a release for
Cecilia Knowles' possessions.

43:28.400 --> 43:30.800
The hospital didn't know
what to do with them.

43:34.200 --> 43:36.700
We'll get another
shot at Mr. Taylor.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.300
Maybe not.

43:40.300 --> 43:43.100
I asked the police
to track down her car.

43:43.100 --> 43:44.800
It turned up in Ohio.

43:45.400 --> 43:48.700
Forensics found two strands
of Julie Gorham's hair.

43:52.000 --> 43:55.200
They were friends. I'm sure
she rode in her sister's car.

43:56.900 --> 43:58.300
In the trunk?

44:01.400 --> 44:02.600
Of course,

44:02.600 --> 44:06.000
the hairs could've come off
of a blanket or some luggage.

44:12.400 --> 44:14.000
We'll ask her,

44:15.600 --> 44:17.200
when she wakes up.

44:18.305 --> 44:24.896
