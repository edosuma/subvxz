WEBVTT

00:13.431 --> 00:15.767
There's no good way
to say this, so I'll put it plain.

00:15.934 --> 00:18.603
Your wife died in the early hours
of this morning.

00:21.815 --> 00:25.735
Don't look at me like that,
like you're a lost puppy.

00:26.945 --> 00:29.239
Oh, shit, Shadow.
No-one told you?

00:29.406 --> 00:31.074
My lucky coin.

00:31.241 --> 00:33.743
Do you believe
in the afterlife?

00:33.910 --> 00:35.453
You rot.

00:35.620 --> 00:37.205
When you die, you rot.

00:38.581 --> 00:40.375
I love you, puppy.

00:44.462 --> 00:46.047
It's not
always gonna be tails.

02:36.533 --> 02:38.493
<i>It had been
a hard journey east</i>

02:38.660 --> 02:40.829
<i>across the land bridge
from Siberia.</i>

02:40.995 --> 02:45.917
<i>Freezing and dark,
and it had taken a bitter toll.</i>

02:51.965 --> 02:54.551
<i>After the custom
of her people...</i>

02:56.219 --> 02:58.680
<i>..Atsula spoke
her baby's name...</i>

02:59.722 --> 03:01.099
Aputi.

03:01.266 --> 03:03.351
<i>.. for the final time.</i>

03:10.859 --> 03:13.194
<i>Her daughter would never see
the new land</i>

03:13.361 --> 03:15.154
<i>to which they travelled.</i>

03:23.580 --> 03:25.415
<i>They did not travel alone.</i>

03:25.582 --> 03:27.625
<i>Their god came with them.</i>

03:27.792 --> 03:29.460
Nunyunnini.

03:56.821 --> 03:59.657
<i>But when they reached
the new lands...</i>

04:01.576 --> 04:04.746
<i>.. the promised food
was nowhere to be found.</i>

04:13.421 --> 04:17.091
<i>Atsula communed
with Nunyunnini...</i>

04:18.176 --> 04:20.094
<i>.. for the barriers
were thinner then</i>

04:20.261 --> 04:22.764
<i>between people and their gods.</i>

04:23.890 --> 04:26.517
<i>And Nunyunnini spoke.</i>

04:26.684 --> 04:29.395
<i>And he showed her what to do,</i>

04:29.562 --> 04:32.148
<i>as he had once shown
her grandmother</i>

04:32.315 --> 04:34.734
<i>and her grandmother's
grandmother.</i>

04:48.164 --> 04:51.960
<i>Nunyunnini loved His people,
as they loved Him.</i>

04:52.126 --> 04:54.045
<i>And so it pained Him
to tell her</i>

04:54.212 --> 04:56.714
<i>that escape from
the cold embrace of starvation</i>

04:56.881 --> 05:00.510
<i>would come at a terrible price.</i>

05:50.768 --> 05:52.645
<i>The gods are great.</i>

05:53.813 --> 05:57.066
<i>But people are greater.</i>

05:58.109 --> 06:00.737
<i>For it is in their hearts
that gods are born.</i>

06:02.113 --> 06:06.034
<i>And to their hearts
that they return.</i>

06:22.800 --> 06:26.220
<i>Gods live and gods die.</i>

06:27.263 --> 06:28.973
<i>And soon enough...</i>

06:30.099 --> 06:33.811
<i>..Nunyunnini was entirely...</i>

06:35.313 --> 06:37.231
<i>.. forgotten.</i>

07:20.108 --> 07:22.527
Hi, puppy.

07:27.573 --> 07:29.117
Hey...

07:30.159 --> 07:31.702
..baby.

07:34.372 --> 07:36.290
What the fuck
are you doing here?

07:36.457 --> 07:38.709
I'm cold, puppy.

07:48.469 --> 07:51.764
I was just seeing
if you were real.

07:54.308 --> 07:55.810
I'm real.

07:55.977 --> 07:57.520
Here.

07:57.687 --> 07:59.981
Come sit by me.

08:08.447 --> 08:11.242
You know, we got some
unresolved issues to discuss.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.164
You and Robbie?

08:17.206 --> 08:18.624
Yes.

08:18.791 --> 08:20.960
Yes. There is that.

08:21.127 --> 08:24.213
Uh, there's also the miracle

08:24.380 --> 08:27.049
of me sitting here posthumously.

08:27.216 --> 08:29.218
I mean, that's a pretty
significant thing

08:29.385 --> 08:31.304
for us to discuss too

08:31.470 --> 08:33.389
and to appreciate.

08:33.556 --> 08:35.933
Maybe we should take a moment
and do that.

08:36.100 --> 08:38.811
No.
You rising from the dead?

08:38.978 --> 08:40.897
It's about par
for the fucking course

08:41.063 --> 08:42.440
since I left prison, OK?

08:42.607 --> 08:44.650
So don't think that anything
you got to say or do,

08:44.817 --> 08:45.985
including dying,

08:46.152 --> 08:48.070
is going to distract
from the subject at hand.

08:48.237 --> 08:49.906
OK, you want to know
about me and Robbie?

08:50.072 --> 08:51.449
- Yeah.
- To what degree?

08:51.616 --> 08:53.201
I mean, do you want
to know everything?

08:53.367 --> 08:55.411
Or do you want to know
the broad strokes, so to speak?

08:56.787 --> 08:59.123
Why don't you start telling me

08:59.290 --> 09:01.417
and I will tell you
when to stop?

09:03.502 --> 09:06.714
I wasn't lying when I said
that I could wait for you

09:06.881 --> 09:08.507
at the time that I said it.

09:08.674 --> 09:10.760
I sort of knew that it had
the potential of being a lie,

09:10.927 --> 09:13.221
but I was giving myself
the benefit of the doubt

09:13.387 --> 09:14.889
that there was a version
of events

09:15.056 --> 09:16.849
where it wouldn't be a lie.

09:17.892 --> 09:19.602
You were in prison, Shadow.

09:20.895 --> 09:23.147
How long did you wait?

09:23.314 --> 09:24.857
13 months.

09:25.024 --> 09:27.443
Baker's year.

09:29.737 --> 09:32.031
Why did you have to fuck Robbie?

09:32.198 --> 09:37.787
Well, I wasn't going to do it,
and then I was going to do it,

09:37.954 --> 09:39.664
and then I wasn't
going to do it,

09:39.830 --> 09:42.875
and then it felt really good
having not done it, and then...

09:44.210 --> 09:45.753
..the cat died...

09:46.837 --> 09:48.381
..and, um...

09:48.547 --> 09:52.927
..Robbie came over
and, you know, wine.

09:53.094 --> 09:55.846
You know
what they say about grief.

09:56.931 --> 09:58.975
Next to every cemetery
is a motel.

10:05.147 --> 10:07.441
Once we did it,
we'd already done it,

10:07.608 --> 10:10.027
and there was no undoing it.

10:10.194 --> 10:12.029
Were you going to leave me
for him?

10:12.196 --> 10:14.031
For Robbie? Please.

10:14.198 --> 10:15.783
Why would I do that?

10:16.826 --> 10:18.369
You're my puppy.

10:19.412 --> 10:20.955
I love you.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.001
I...

10:30.548 --> 10:32.091
So...

10:37.930 --> 10:39.473
What happened?

10:40.516 --> 10:42.643
The night you were killed,
what...what happened?

10:43.686 --> 10:45.062
Um...

10:45.229 --> 10:47.148
So, anyway, we were driving.

10:47.315 --> 10:50.234
And he was upset.

10:50.401 --> 10:53.070
And so I decided to give him

10:53.237 --> 10:55.364
a little goodbye blowjob,
you know?

10:55.531 --> 10:57.283
One last time with feeling.

10:57.450 --> 11:00.453
And so I unzipped his pants.

11:00.619 --> 11:03.331
- Big mistake.
- Yeah. No shit.

11:03.497 --> 11:08.461
Um, he swerved,
and there was a big crunch,

11:08.627 --> 11:11.380
and the world started
to roll and spin.

11:11.547 --> 11:13.090
And I thought...

11:14.133 --> 11:15.718
..fuck.

11:16.761 --> 11:18.471
I'm going to die.

11:21.766 --> 11:24.560
I mean, really, I was very blah
about the whole thing.

11:24.727 --> 11:27.229
I wasn't scared.
I remember that.

11:31.442 --> 11:32.985
Then I was...

11:34.028 --> 11:35.571
..somewhere.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.410
And then...

11:42.453 --> 11:44.163
..I was in a box.

11:54.048 --> 11:55.966
Puppy, do you think
that you could possibly

11:56.133 --> 11:57.635
get me a cigarette?

11:58.677 --> 12:01.055
I think it might calm my nerves.

12:02.098 --> 12:03.766
Might calm yours as well.

13:46.076 --> 13:47.828
Laura?

13:47.995 --> 13:50.080
I'm in here, puppy.

13:53.209 --> 13:56.545
I thought it might be nice
if I were warm to the touch,

13:56.712 --> 13:59.507
in the event that you were
thinking of touching me.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.637
Or kissing me.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.932
I don't want you
kissing cold lips.

14:19.318 --> 14:20.945
What?

14:25.741 --> 14:28.536
Normally, people who die
tend to stay in their graves,

14:28.702 --> 14:30.246
that's what.

14:31.413 --> 14:32.790
Do they really, puppy?

14:32.957 --> 14:36.961
I mean, I used to think so too,
but now I'm not so sure.

14:38.546 --> 14:40.506
Maybe.

14:53.602 --> 14:55.646
Yeah, what is it?

14:56.855 --> 14:58.357
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

14:59.858 --> 15:00.859
What?!

15:11.036 --> 15:12.705
Can't taste it.

15:14.540 --> 15:18.544
This is not doing anything,
nerve-wise or otherwise.

15:34.476 --> 15:36.604
Want to put that on my finger?

15:48.699 --> 15:52.578
When I called you,
the last time...

15:54.371 --> 15:57.499
..I had a feeling I was never
going to see you again.

16:02.963 --> 16:05.299
I think I knew
you were going to die.

16:05.466 --> 16:09.053
I had this feeling in my stomach
that something was wrong.

16:11.221 --> 16:14.558
There is a big storm rolling
across the country right now,

16:14.725 --> 16:16.769
and nothing feels OK.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.064
This feels OK.

16:21.774 --> 16:23.359
You and me...

16:24.652 --> 16:26.862
..it can.

16:42.461 --> 16:44.380
I'm sure there are some things
about our marriage

16:44.546 --> 16:46.632
that we're going
to have to work on.

16:50.177 --> 16:53.138
What? Like...you being dead?

17:23.961 --> 17:25.671
I tasted that.

17:26.839 --> 17:28.340
I felt that.

17:28.507 --> 17:31.135
I just... I felt something.

17:31.301 --> 17:34.096
It felt like...like alive.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.766
Do I feel alive?

17:41.645 --> 17:43.021
Yeah.

17:43.188 --> 17:45.023
Good.

17:50.654 --> 17:52.489
You know...

17:54.867 --> 17:58.328
I don't really know much more now
than I did when I was alive,

17:58.495 --> 18:01.457
and I think whatever I know now
that I didn't know then,

18:01.623 --> 18:04.168
I can't even really
put into words.

18:04.334 --> 18:07.921
But I do know that I love you.

18:08.088 --> 18:11.884
I mean, I had to die
to know just how much, but...

18:13.260 --> 18:14.845
..I really do.

18:16.180 --> 18:19.099
You know,
you've gotten yourself mixed up

18:19.266 --> 18:21.477
in some really weird shit,
Shadow.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.522
I'm watching out for you.

18:27.274 --> 18:29.359
Thank you for my present,
by the way.

18:29.526 --> 18:31.069
What present?

18:31.236 --> 18:32.613
My coin.

18:35.657 --> 18:38.702
Yeah, I know someone
looking for that coin.

18:38.869 --> 18:40.412
Well, they can't have it.

18:40.579 --> 18:42.206
It's mine now.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.834
Are you still my puppy?

18:56.637 --> 19:00.015
No. I'm not.

19:34.675 --> 19:36.260
Still awake?

19:36.426 --> 19:38.470
I think so.

19:38.637 --> 19:40.806
Yeah, me too. Can't sleep.

19:41.890 --> 19:45.394
Recent events have conspired
against us both.

19:45.561 --> 19:47.938
And I need a drink.
A man can admit that, huh?

19:48.105 --> 19:50.357
Yeah, uh, I just really
want to go to bed.

19:50.524 --> 19:52.442
- Put the day behind me.
- Come on. One drink.

19:52.609 --> 19:54.361
Well, that's a lie.
Five, six drinks.

19:54.528 --> 19:57.030
- Look, now isn't the time.
- Hmm?

19:57.197 --> 19:58.282
Shadow.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.367
You must have questions,

20:00.534 --> 20:02.703
and if you don't, you should.

20:02.870 --> 20:04.329
What is that smell?

20:04.496 --> 20:06.415
What is it?
Cat piss and oven cleaner?

20:06.582 --> 20:08.750
I do... I do have questions.

20:08.917 --> 20:11.420
Hey, I'm making a list,
a long list.

20:11.587 --> 20:12.963
But right now,

20:13.130 --> 20:15.716
I just need to wrap my head
around what I've seen.

20:22.139 --> 20:24.308
I see you've seen something.

20:43.827 --> 20:45.871
Hands where I can see them.
Now.

20:46.038 --> 20:48.957
My hands are right here, ma'am.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.377
Didn't take long.

20:52.544 --> 20:55.005
Parole officer says
you've been out all of six days.

20:55.172 --> 20:57.466
- What's this about, ma'am?
- You're under arrest, genius.

20:57.633 --> 20:59.760
May I ask what for?

20:59.927 --> 21:02.220
Bank robbery.

22:28.974 --> 22:30.058
Fuck.

22:50.746 --> 22:52.456
Why, you pretty thing, you.

22:53.498 --> 22:55.625
- ♪ Oh-oh-oh... ♪
- What?

22:55.792 --> 22:57.794
You have an image problem.

22:57.961 --> 22:59.963
You need to think about
your brand,

23:00.130 --> 23:02.090
how you want the world
to see you,

23:02.257 --> 23:05.093
how you want Mr World
to see you.

23:05.260 --> 23:07.220
Tasked with asking
a few questions,

23:07.387 --> 23:09.890
you hang a black man
from a tree.

23:10.932 --> 23:13.018
You've got your transmission
and your live wire,

23:13.185 --> 23:15.020
but your circuit's dead.

23:15.187 --> 23:18.482
He was fucking with me.
I told him not to fuck with me.

23:18.648 --> 23:22.444
Take a look at you,
beating up the wrong guy.

23:23.487 --> 23:26.656
You're a good kid, just not good
with people you don't know.

23:26.823 --> 23:29.034
Apologise.

23:30.077 --> 23:33.663
Please pass on my sincerest
apologies to Mr World.

23:35.749 --> 23:37.876
Mr World doesn't want
your apology.

23:39.211 --> 23:42.964
He would, however,
like to re-gift your apology

23:43.131 --> 23:46.093
to Wednesday
and his man Shadow Moon.

23:46.259 --> 23:48.512
♪ Oh-oh-oh... ♪

23:49.554 --> 23:51.890
Are you fucking with me
right now?

23:52.057 --> 23:57.354
Mr World expects your apology
to be every bit as authentic

23:57.521 --> 24:00.524
as if you were apologising
to him directly.

24:02.067 --> 24:04.444
He's letting the old fuck
get away with it.

24:06.196 --> 24:09.533
There is a terror in knowing
what Mr World is about.

24:09.699 --> 24:12.369
Wednesday was suffocating.

24:12.536 --> 24:15.080
The spark was smouldering.

24:15.247 --> 24:19.668
And then you came along,
putting out fire with gasoline.

24:19.835 --> 24:22.587
Wednesday's collecting monsters.
Fucking Pokémon.

24:22.754 --> 24:24.714
He's recruiting.

24:25.757 --> 24:28.635
Martyrdom is a popular
recruitment tool.

24:28.802 --> 24:31.263
And now we have to pluck
the fuse out of the fucker

24:31.429 --> 24:33.723
before the whole thing
blows up in our faces.

24:33.890 --> 24:35.267
♪ Oh-oh-oh... ♪

24:35.433 --> 24:36.726
Apologise.

24:36.893 --> 24:38.770
You're delusional
if you think he's letting go

24:38.937 --> 24:40.522
of whatever it is
he's holding on to

24:40.689 --> 24:42.232
with a little apology from me.

24:42.399 --> 24:48.196
That is one
mass fucking delusion.

24:48.363 --> 24:51.408
Mass delusions
are as old as I am.

24:51.575 --> 24:55.078
I was there when the Martians
invaded in 1938.

24:55.245 --> 24:57.038
What a panic.

24:57.205 --> 24:59.291
Powerful panic.

25:00.333 --> 25:02.586
Now there are starmen
waiting in the sky.

25:02.752 --> 25:04.671
They believed it was true,
and it was.

25:04.838 --> 25:07.716
- ♪ Oh-oh-oh... ♪
- Not everyone believed.

25:07.883 --> 25:11.511
Not everyone had to.
Just enough.

25:12.554 --> 25:16.516
That's all Mr Wednesday needs -
just enough.

25:17.726 --> 25:19.102
Maybe just one.

25:19.269 --> 25:20.979
♪ Oh-oh-oh

25:27.986 --> 25:30.071
♪ Oh-oh-oh. ♪

25:34.492 --> 25:37.412
Your boss doesn't seem
to have an ID, record,

25:37.579 --> 25:38.997
somehow even a name.

25:39.164 --> 25:41.541
You had all those, Mr Moon.
Record especially.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.251
Lawyer.

25:43.418 --> 25:45.212
Didn't catch that.

25:47.672 --> 25:50.133
You're probably asking yourself
about now how it came to pass

25:50.300 --> 25:54.012
that two country-fried police
even found you at that motel

25:54.179 --> 25:58.350
for a crime committed over -
count 'em - two state lines.

25:58.516 --> 26:01.895
It's a good story. Just ask.

26:02.062 --> 26:03.855
Lawyer, please.

26:04.898 --> 26:06.358
Hmm.

26:06.524 --> 26:08.818
I thought maybe you were going
to say something different.

26:08.985 --> 26:12.322
So this guy Moon
robbed you?

26:12.489 --> 26:14.074
He stole me.

26:14.241 --> 26:18.203
From the, uh, Aged Oaks
Retirement Home where you live?

26:18.370 --> 26:19.788
- What Oaks?
- Mm-hm.

26:19.955 --> 26:21.331
Yeah.

26:21.498 --> 26:23.708
No, no, no, no, no, no.
There's no sand there.

26:23.875 --> 26:25.752
I live on a beach.
I always have.

26:25.919 --> 26:28.922
We like to go fishing,
me and the boys, you know?

26:29.089 --> 26:31.716
My wife hates it, though.
She...she loves fish.

26:31.883 --> 26:35.428
Loves wine. Hates fishing.

26:35.595 --> 26:38.473
Uh, why don't we start
with your name, huh?

26:40.225 --> 26:43.436
Madam Life's a piece in bloom.

26:43.603 --> 26:47.023
Death goes dogging everywhere.

26:47.190 --> 26:51.027
She's the tenant of the room.
He's the ruffian on the stair.

26:51.194 --> 26:52.737
Look, I get it.

26:52.904 --> 26:54.781
You're a week out of jail.

26:54.948 --> 26:57.701
You meet some old grifter
who seems to know his way around.

26:57.867 --> 27:00.537
The guy offers a job,
a chance to learn.

27:01.746 --> 27:04.249
But I think this boss of yours

27:04.416 --> 27:06.960
pissed off
some big-time bombers.

27:07.127 --> 27:08.712
And whether you realise it
or not,

27:08.878 --> 27:10.505
you're about to get hit
by the shrapnel.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.966
Lawyer.

27:18.430 --> 27:20.098
Ah.

27:20.265 --> 27:21.808
What were you doing in Chicago?

27:21.975 --> 27:23.685
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

27:23.852 --> 27:26.896
- Try me.
- Chicago.

27:27.063 --> 27:28.982
Honest answers only.

27:29.149 --> 27:30.608
If you can manage.

27:31.651 --> 27:33.069
God's honest.

27:34.446 --> 27:38.950
I was recruiting a tired
but still vital god of death

27:39.117 --> 27:42.954
into a war against the new gods
who very rightly fear Him

27:43.121 --> 27:48.084
as much as they should fear me
but don't yet.

27:48.251 --> 27:51.087
You're not dumb.
Might even be smart.

27:51.254 --> 27:53.715
I get that, and I respect that.

27:53.882 --> 27:57.093
In every other case, you'd be doing
what experience advises.

27:57.260 --> 27:58.803
Now, the reason
I take pause here,

27:58.970 --> 28:01.181
the reason I'm hoping you will break
from the natural script

28:01.348 --> 28:03.391
is that this is, I suspect,
suspect strongly,

28:03.558 --> 28:06.353
this is not the average case.

28:07.812 --> 28:12.233
So...take a moment to consider
answering my next question

28:12.400 --> 28:15.028
before saying what you're
going to say anyway, OK?

28:16.363 --> 28:18.907
Does your boss have enemies?

28:20.533 --> 28:21.910
Lawyer.

28:22.077 --> 28:24.579
The reason I ask is because
some anonymous tip

28:24.746 --> 28:29.000
dropped you right in our laps,
boxed up with a bow.

28:29.167 --> 28:31.753
But not the usual "Hey, I saw
someone who looked like the guy

28:31.920 --> 28:34.130
"on 'America's Most Wanted'
at the Carl's Jr drive-thru."

28:34.297 --> 28:36.341
This was, uh,
I'm going to say different.

28:36.508 --> 28:42.138
I got a goddamn fax on a machine
that hasn't been turned on in,

28:42.305 --> 28:44.557
I don't know,
since fax machines.

28:44.724 --> 28:49.938
And this fax gave us
your precise location,

28:50.105 --> 28:52.816
GPS coordinates, make,
model, mileage,

28:52.982 --> 28:54.484
even VIN number of your Caddy.

28:54.651 --> 28:56.236
Now, much as I'd get accolades

28:56.403 --> 28:58.613
if we collar you two
for the bank bullshit,

28:58.780 --> 29:01.574
it's nowhere near
as big or as interesting

29:01.741 --> 29:04.786
as what is suggested
by the details.

29:05.870 --> 29:07.455
Now, you help me unpack those,

29:07.622 --> 29:09.874
I may just help get you
out of here.

29:12.752 --> 29:14.129
You have my attention.

29:14.295 --> 29:15.839
Now, the leprechaun,

29:16.005 --> 29:18.174
he's been against all this
from the get-go,

29:18.341 --> 29:22.053
but he's at a disadvantage
being as he is a fucking idiot.

29:22.220 --> 29:25.181
Now, Nancy,
he comes at all of this

29:25.348 --> 29:27.976
from a specific vantage
of the bitterly dispossessed,

29:28.143 --> 29:30.061
which normally I would take
with a grain,

29:30.228 --> 29:31.980
but I have to admit,

29:32.147 --> 29:34.357
having seen the rope burns

29:34.524 --> 29:36.401
around my friend's neck...

29:36.568 --> 29:41.990
So, imagine, two rural police,
middle of wild turkey season,

29:42.157 --> 29:44.951
and the same company
whose tech found Osama

29:45.118 --> 29:48.496
is dropping two no-name grifters
in our lap.

29:50.290 --> 29:53.543
You two have
very extravagant enemies.

29:56.212 --> 29:58.339
Lawyer?

29:59.883 --> 30:01.718
What's the ask?

30:01.885 --> 30:04.596
Uh, you got me curious.

30:04.762 --> 30:07.599
I'd like to know what you know.

30:09.309 --> 30:11.394
I don't think you do.

30:11.561 --> 30:14.522
I'm a big girl.
I make my own mistakes.

30:14.689 --> 30:17.275
- You offering me something?
- Might be.

30:19.319 --> 30:22.363
I want to walk out of here soon.

30:22.530 --> 30:24.240
Got somewhere to be?

30:26.910 --> 30:28.661
Prison Bureau says...

30:29.704 --> 30:31.623
..your wife just passed away.

30:32.665 --> 30:35.502
D.A. can be persuaded
to look leniently on that.

30:38.671 --> 30:40.423
Losing a wife...

30:42.091 --> 30:44.093
It's got to be complicated.

31:22.549 --> 31:24.092
You're the wife.

31:25.426 --> 31:27.095
You're the dead wife.

31:28.263 --> 31:31.015
Give me my fucking coin,
dead wife.

31:46.489 --> 31:48.908
You mean MY fucking coin.

31:55.248 --> 31:57.292
The dead can't own things.

31:57.458 --> 31:59.919
That's why God made
last wills and testaments.

32:00.086 --> 32:02.589
Don't imagine yours
includes my lucky coin.

32:03.631 --> 32:05.800
Oh! Ohh! Oh!

32:05.967 --> 32:08.219
- My lucky coin, Ginger Minge.
- Fuck!

32:08.386 --> 32:10.430
My husband gave that coin to me.

32:12.515 --> 32:14.267
Damn his dark eyes.

32:14.434 --> 32:16.185
Gave it a-fucking-way.

32:16.352 --> 32:18.104
It wasn't his to give!

32:18.271 --> 32:20.315
I gave him the wrong coin.

32:20.481 --> 32:24.277
Wasn't meant to be that coin.

32:24.444 --> 32:25.903
That's for royalty, see?

32:26.070 --> 32:28.323
That's a coin you give to
the King of America himself,

32:28.489 --> 32:31.242
not some piss-ant bastard
like your piece-of-shit husband.

32:33.911 --> 32:35.788
Just give me
my fucking coin back!

32:36.831 --> 32:37.707
No.

32:37.874 --> 32:39.709
You'll never see me again
if you do.

32:39.876 --> 32:41.461
I swear to fucking Bran, OK?

32:41.628 --> 32:44.464
I swear by the years I spent
in the fucking trees.

32:45.548 --> 32:48.134
Give me my coin, cunt!

32:51.471 --> 32:52.639
Ohh!

32:55.391 --> 32:57.060
I'm going to ask you
some questions

32:57.226 --> 32:58.728
and I'd like for you
to answer me honestly.

32:58.895 --> 33:01.189
However, if I feel like
you're not being honest,

33:01.356 --> 33:03.149
I'm going to kick you
in the nuts.

33:03.316 --> 33:05.610
I want you to know that the last time
I kicked a guy in the nuts,

33:05.777 --> 33:07.695
my foot didn't stop until
it reached his throat, OK?

33:07.862 --> 33:10.865
How do you know my husband?

33:11.032 --> 33:13.159
I was told to be at a bar.
Pick a fight with your man.

33:13.326 --> 33:15.244
Said he wanted to see
what your man was made of.

33:15.411 --> 33:16.579
Who said?

33:16.746 --> 33:18.665
- Use your words.
- Uhh! Grimnir!

33:18.831 --> 33:21.167
The dude he calls Wednesday.

33:31.177 --> 33:32.595
Fuck!

33:33.721 --> 33:35.306
He's a god.

33:37.558 --> 33:39.394
- You don't believe me?
- No, no.

33:39.560 --> 33:41.020
Just processing.

33:41.187 --> 33:44.065
Um, what else
did God tell you to do?

33:45.233 --> 33:47.610
You shouldn't trust him -
Grimnir.

33:47.777 --> 33:49.112
- Wednesday.
- Don't trust him.

33:49.278 --> 33:51.906
- Don't have to trust him.
- Your man does and he shouldn't.

33:53.032 --> 33:56.786
Listen, just give me
my fucking coin back, yeah?

33:57.829 --> 34:00.289
Hey. There's more
where that came from.

34:01.416 --> 34:03.042
I'll give you another.

34:04.627 --> 34:06.462
Just as good.

34:07.964 --> 34:09.841
Hell.

34:10.007 --> 34:11.467
I'll give you a shitload.

34:17.598 --> 34:19.684
Just as good?

34:20.727 --> 34:22.061
Just as good.

34:26.983 --> 34:28.359
Hmm.

34:28.526 --> 34:30.445
I don't really feel
like any of those coins

34:30.611 --> 34:32.655
are going to do the job
that my coin's doing.

34:38.870 --> 34:40.913
You can't take it, can you?

34:42.165 --> 34:43.916
I have to give it
to you freely.

34:44.083 --> 34:46.210
- Right?
- Right.

34:46.377 --> 34:48.546
Well, you're fucked.

34:49.589 --> 34:52.675
I'm not going to give it to you.
Come on.

34:52.842 --> 34:54.719
I don't think you're ever
going to get your coin back.

34:54.886 --> 34:56.971
Never ever ever.

34:57.138 --> 34:58.681
Not ever.

35:02.643 --> 35:04.979
Not not ever.

35:06.063 --> 35:08.608
Meat's going to slide off you
sooner or later, dead wife.

35:08.775 --> 35:11.402
Sooner if you keep soaking it
in hot water.

35:12.445 --> 35:14.781
All that connective tissue
holding you together.

35:14.947 --> 35:16.491
That's going to liquefy.

35:17.533 --> 35:20.077
You'll find yourself
on a hot, humid summer day

35:20.244 --> 35:22.371
just cooking in that moist heat.

35:23.664 --> 35:26.501
And you're going to fall
right off the bone.

35:26.667 --> 35:31.005
When you do, I'm going
to reach up under those ribs,

35:31.172 --> 35:34.967
and I'm going to pluck that coin
out of you like a berry.

35:41.724 --> 35:42.975
Argh!

35:53.236 --> 35:55.571
Freeze! Hands up!

35:56.614 --> 35:59.492
She ain't dead! She ain't dead.

35:59.659 --> 36:01.202
See?

36:03.329 --> 36:04.872
Oh, you're an asshole.

36:05.915 --> 36:07.583
You're a fucking asshole,
dead wife!

36:07.750 --> 36:09.252
You're a fucking
asshole, dead wife!

36:09.418 --> 36:11.420
You're an asshole, dead wife!

36:24.976 --> 36:26.519
He's loyal.

36:30.940 --> 36:36.654
So, you two talk about
whatever you need to talk about.

36:36.821 --> 36:38.656
Then I want to hear it.

36:39.699 --> 36:42.618
I have nothing to talk about.

36:43.703 --> 36:45.246
Hmm.

36:52.086 --> 36:53.838
Something to talk about now?

36:57.216 --> 36:59.051
I'll leave you two to it.

37:10.479 --> 37:12.148
What the fuck are you doing?

37:12.315 --> 37:14.025
If we don't get
out of here soon,

37:14.191 --> 37:16.110
they'll be carrying out
a couple of corpses.

37:16.277 --> 37:18.779
Those photographs are
a particular god's-eye view

37:18.946 --> 37:20.489
of the world.

37:24.785 --> 37:27.371
- OK, how'd you do that?
- See that little spider?

37:27.538 --> 37:29.540
He's a friend of mine.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.169
That cop was right, wasn't she?

37:33.336 --> 37:35.713
Someone big is after you.

37:36.797 --> 37:38.299
You're afraid.

37:39.342 --> 37:41.427
I thought you weren't afraid
of anything.

37:43.512 --> 37:45.514
Who are you?

37:50.770 --> 37:52.605
Who's after you?

37:55.316 --> 37:56.859
Who's after you?

37:58.444 --> 37:59.654
Who's after you?!

37:59.820 --> 38:01.739
Someone you don't want
to let see your face

38:01.906 --> 38:03.616
until you're ready to be seen.

38:23.552 --> 38:25.513
'I Love Lucy'?

38:25.680 --> 38:28.599
How the fuck are you floating?

38:29.642 --> 38:32.144
Happy birthday, Mr President.

38:38.109 --> 38:39.610
No. No, no, no.

38:39.777 --> 38:41.821
You...you...you're TV.

38:41.988 --> 38:43.489
You...you...you're
black and white.

38:43.656 --> 38:46.200
I'm as colourful
as the story I'm telling.

38:46.367 --> 38:50.287
This one's filmed
in glorious Technicolor.

38:50.454 --> 38:54.250
Full-colour pin-up
to film legend to murdered.

38:55.501 --> 38:58.379
Oh, don't believe what they say
about an accidental overdose.

38:58.546 --> 39:01.757
Last thing I saw from the floor
of my Brentwood bungalow

39:01.924 --> 39:05.720
was a CIA spook jabbing a needle
into my eyeball,

39:05.886 --> 39:08.723
lest I tell Kennedy
tales unwanted.

39:08.889 --> 39:10.891
Oh! Oooh! Oh!

39:11.058 --> 39:12.768
Isn't that delicious?

39:14.103 --> 39:15.813
We have no business with you.

39:15.980 --> 39:17.481
Not at the moment.

39:17.648 --> 39:19.316
We want to change that.

39:23.112 --> 39:25.031
It's just as easy
to fall in love

39:25.197 --> 39:27.742
with a rich man as a poor man.

39:27.908 --> 39:29.910
No, no, no, no, no.
This isn't real. OK?

39:30.077 --> 39:32.663
This is reality reprogrammed, right?
Tell me this isn't real.

40:04.653 --> 40:07.156
Mr Wednesday.

40:09.450 --> 40:11.202
Overdue.

40:12.828 --> 40:15.372
I have to start with an apology.

40:15.539 --> 40:17.458
I've been remiss.

40:18.501 --> 40:21.212
I should have reached out
to you ages ago.

40:22.505 --> 40:24.548
But to be honest,

40:24.715 --> 40:26.425
I didn't see you,

40:26.592 --> 40:28.844
not clearly,

40:29.011 --> 40:32.098
not like this here
now in person.

40:32.264 --> 40:34.975
You are huge.

40:35.142 --> 40:37.436
It's a pleasure to meet you.

40:39.772 --> 40:41.107
Have we met?

40:41.273 --> 40:44.777
Do not talk to him.
Do not say a word.

40:44.944 --> 40:47.238
Do not tell him anything.

40:47.404 --> 40:49.156
You don't have to.

40:52.910 --> 40:54.578
I already know you.

40:58.374 --> 40:59.750
No, you don't.

40:59.917 --> 41:01.544
Sure I do.

41:02.586 --> 41:04.130
You're a person.

41:04.296 --> 41:08.801
I know people,
everything about all of them.

41:08.968 --> 41:12.304
You have a name - Shadow Moon.

41:12.471 --> 41:16.725
You have a blood type
and a recurring nightmare.

41:16.892 --> 41:19.812
B-positive
and an orchard of bones.

41:19.979 --> 41:22.439
You prefer Swiss to cheddar

41:22.606 --> 41:25.651
and can't abide the tines
of two forks touching.

41:25.818 --> 41:28.654
And this is the face you make
when you masturbate.

41:31.448 --> 41:33.450
The same as your mother,

41:33.617 --> 41:37.163
who had 86 sexual partners
throughout her life.

41:39.957 --> 41:42.710
Everything that happens
is recorded

41:42.877 --> 41:44.837
and stored and recalled.

41:45.004 --> 41:48.007
The Book of Life.

41:51.677 --> 41:54.221
Right. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

41:59.602 --> 42:01.604
Is he still sulking?

42:19.955 --> 42:21.540
I'm sorry...

42:22.917 --> 42:24.460
..for lynching you.

42:25.544 --> 42:27.379
Hanged a dark-skinned man.

42:27.546 --> 42:28.797
Ugh!

42:28.964 --> 42:30.716
Was in very poor taste.

42:31.759 --> 42:35.554
We're in a weird, tense place
racially in America,

42:35.721 --> 42:37.765
and I don't want to add
to that climate of hatred.

42:45.981 --> 42:48.984
Would you like to hit him a bit?
Knock out his front teeth?

42:52.363 --> 42:53.697
No.

42:54.740 --> 42:56.700
I'm glad that we have this
behind us.

42:59.245 --> 43:02.873
Like a Renaissance pope,
I absolve you. You may sit.

43:03.040 --> 43:05.084
You have something to say
to the man.

43:15.636 --> 43:17.596
Technology's evolving.
We're all evolving.

43:17.763 --> 43:21.809
It would be an honour, sir,
to evolve with you.

43:21.976 --> 43:23.352
I can help you.

43:23.519 --> 43:25.020
I want to help you

43:25.187 --> 43:28.107
influence opinions, behaviours,
beliefs like never before.

43:29.233 --> 43:32.152
We want to help you
find your audience.

43:33.612 --> 43:37.241
You see?
We're not here to fight.

43:39.285 --> 43:41.745
So you're offering a truce.

43:41.912 --> 43:44.790
A truce implies
that we were ever at war.

43:46.458 --> 43:48.877
You might have been
but I wasn't.

43:49.044 --> 43:51.547
No, not a truce.

43:52.589 --> 43:53.841
A...

43:54.008 --> 43:56.093
- A merger.
- Yes.

43:57.386 --> 43:58.887
A merger!

43:59.054 --> 44:00.556
Like champagne and potato chips.

44:00.723 --> 44:04.643
Have you ever dipped
a potato chip into champagne?

44:04.810 --> 44:07.438
It's real crazy, you know?

44:07.604 --> 44:09.648
Wouldn't you like an upgrade?

44:09.815 --> 44:14.153
A brand-new lemon-scented you?

44:14.320 --> 44:18.949
Oh, I'm a fine me. I just
keep getting better every year.

44:19.116 --> 44:20.743
Of course you are,

44:20.909 --> 44:22.661
and that is the you

44:22.828 --> 44:26.081
that deserves to be seen
incorporated.

44:26.248 --> 44:29.001
Everyone in the world
gets their place.

44:29.168 --> 44:30.294
With you?

44:30.461 --> 44:32.671
That's why they call me
Mr World.

44:32.838 --> 44:34.506
And if they don't agree?

44:40.304 --> 44:41.930
I get it.

44:43.265 --> 44:44.683
I do.

44:44.850 --> 44:47.394
You're an individualist.

44:47.561 --> 44:51.065
Rugged individualism.

44:51.231 --> 44:54.985
It simply doesn't work anymore.

44:55.152 --> 44:57.696
Brands. Sure.

44:57.863 --> 44:59.698
A useful heuristic.

44:59.865 --> 45:05.788
But ultimately, everything
is all systems interlaced,

45:05.954 --> 45:11.168
a single product
manufactured by a single company

45:11.335 --> 45:14.296
for a single global market.

45:14.463 --> 45:17.758
Spicy, medium or chunky!

45:17.925 --> 45:21.011
They get a choice, of course.
Of course!

45:22.346 --> 45:26.058
But they are buying salsa.

45:31.063 --> 45:32.439
Show him.

45:42.366 --> 45:45.702
The ODIN
guidance satellite.

45:47.413 --> 45:50.666
To be launched over North Korea
next month.

45:50.833 --> 45:52.793
Just imagine.

45:52.960 --> 45:56.130
Lightning raining down
from the sky

45:56.296 --> 45:59.508
in the form
of precision-guided missiles.

45:59.675 --> 46:04.847
Could you imagine?
24.9 million people.

46:05.013 --> 46:08.642
They will know your name
lickety-kite.

46:10.227 --> 46:13.063
Brand re-branded
and just the start.

46:13.230 --> 46:16.150
No more stolen scraps,
short-changing,

46:16.316 --> 46:18.152
hand-to-mouth, grey hairs.

46:18.318 --> 46:20.654
No more motels and byways.

46:20.821 --> 46:24.283
A place in tomorrow.
Current, lasting.

46:24.450 --> 46:26.368
Valhalla anew.

46:26.535 --> 46:29.246
Doesn't that sound swell?

46:30.539 --> 46:32.458
An oyster.

46:34.501 --> 46:37.796
Inside every pearl, there's
a single irritating grain of sand.

46:37.963 --> 46:39.673
That's me.

46:39.840 --> 46:42.134
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

46:42.301 --> 46:44.470
Just like an oyster,
you're trying to cover me up

46:44.636 --> 46:46.889
with something smooth and shiny.

46:47.055 --> 46:49.892
Pretty on a necklace,
but inside the shell,

46:50.058 --> 46:53.312
that slimy thing just wants
that scratchy thing out of there.

46:53.479 --> 46:55.898
You say merger? I hear exile.

46:56.064 --> 46:57.566
It's not our fault

46:57.733 --> 46:59.985
they found other ways
to occupy their time.

47:00.152 --> 47:02.988
That's all you do,
occupy their time.

47:03.155 --> 47:05.824
We gave back.
We gave them meaning.

47:10.120 --> 47:12.289
Then give it to them again.

47:19.922 --> 47:21.465
You're leaving?

47:22.508 --> 47:24.426
On a good line.

47:24.593 --> 47:26.595
It was a good line.

47:27.638 --> 47:29.348
He's here.

47:29.515 --> 47:31.141
You have him.

47:31.308 --> 47:33.060
You're letting him go.

47:33.227 --> 47:35.020
You keep letting him go!

47:36.480 --> 47:38.941
I'm giving him
opportunity to consider.

47:39.107 --> 47:41.568
Why?
You have him.

47:41.735 --> 47:43.612
Get a yes
or kill the goonie cunt.

47:43.779 --> 47:46.406
- Bury him upside-down if you...
- This man...

47:46.573 --> 47:49.451
..is older
than you will ever be.

47:49.618 --> 47:52.621
He has wisdom, has knowledge,

47:52.788 --> 47:56.416
which is different,
as you would know if you had either.

47:56.583 --> 48:00.629
This man deserves our respect.

48:04.132 --> 48:05.926
Fuck respect.

48:27.155 --> 48:29.116
My gift to you.

48:31.827 --> 48:34.288
We'll be telling
this story, Shadow.

48:34.454 --> 48:38.417
You can tell it however
you like or don't like.

48:46.550 --> 48:48.510
I'm not your enemy.

49:02.149 --> 49:04.276
Was this real?

49:05.736 --> 49:07.362
Did that just happen?

49:08.405 --> 49:10.240
It's still happening.

49:22.836 --> 49:24.212
Come on.

49:50.864 --> 49:53.075
What story are they
going to tell here?

49:53.241 --> 49:55.077
Any one they want.

50:18.433 --> 50:20.018
Someone's coming.

50:23.230 --> 50:26.066
Dispatch control.
This is Cassius PD 6651.

50:26.233 --> 50:27.818
Radio check.

51:03.311 --> 51:04.521
Kick it.

51:04.688 --> 51:06.356
There.
