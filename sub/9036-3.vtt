WEBVTT

00:09.077 --> 00:12.480
- HANG IN THERE, HONEY.
I THINK I HEAR DADDY COMING.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.448
I THINK I HEAR HIM COMING.

00:14.482 --> 00:15.716
- HEY.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.588
WHAT, HAS HE BEEN
DRINKING AGAIN?

00:30.698 --> 00:32.166
HI, I'M RAY.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.667
I LIVE HERE
IN LONG ISLAND

00:33.701 --> 00:41.775
WITH MY WIFE, DEBRA,

00:41.809 --> 00:43.377
MY FIVE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,

00:43.411 --> 00:46.147
AND TWIN
ALMOST-TWO-YEAR-OLD BOYS.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.249
MY PARENTS LIVE
ACROSS THE STREET.

00:48.282 --> 00:57.258
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:57.291 --> 01:00.060
THE TRUTH IS,
I'D DO ANYTHING FOR MY FAMILY.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.532
AND--DONE.

01:15.509 --> 01:17.411
HEY.

01:17.445 --> 01:21.715
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK
IS REALLY SEXY?

01:21.749 --> 01:23.317
- WHAT?

01:23.351 --> 01:25.553
- A MAN WHO DOES
THE DISHES.

01:30.258 --> 01:32.293
- NO.
DOES NOTHING FOR ME.

01:33.361 --> 01:35.529
YOU KNOW WHAT
DOES IT FOR ME?

01:35.563 --> 01:37.898
A WOMAN WHO DOES
THE DISHES--

01:37.931 --> 01:39.567
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.269
- WOW.

01:41.302 --> 01:42.903
- COME ON.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.638
HEY, WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

01:44.672 --> 01:45.806
WHAT HAVE YOU
GOT THERE?

01:45.839 --> 01:46.807
- MOMMY'S PEN.

01:46.840 --> 01:47.841
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.643
THAT'S MY LAUNDRY MARKER.

01:49.677 --> 01:51.779
HONEY, HAVE YOU BEEN
DRAWING ON THE WALLS AGAIN?

01:51.812 --> 01:53.447
- NO.
I DREW ON GEOFFREY.

01:53.481 --> 01:54.448
- YOU--

01:54.482 --> 01:56.284
- OH.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.252
WHAT?
YOU DREW ON GEOFFREY?

01:58.286 --> 01:59.720
- HE ASKED ME TO.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.555
- OH, MY GOD.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.531
IT'S BAD NEWS
FOR EUROPE, RAY.

02:10.564 --> 02:13.367
- JUST RELAX.
ALL RIGHT?

02:13.401 --> 02:14.802
JUST RELAX.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.170
IT'S COMING OFF.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.938
IT'S COMING OFF.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.308
IT'S NOT COMING OFF.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.577
- HERE. LET ME SEE
IF I CAN DO THIS.

02:23.611 --> 02:24.612
[knock on door]

02:24.645 --> 02:26.680
ALLY, COME ON.
COME WITH ME.

02:29.883 --> 02:32.320
- YOU KNOW
YOUR FRONT DOOR IS LOCKED?

02:32.353 --> 02:36.357
- YEAH, WE THOUGHT IT WOULD
KEEP OUT THE BAD PEOPLE.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.759
- YOU THINK EVIL
CARES ABOUT A LOCK?

02:42.396 --> 02:44.232
- RAY, I'VE GOT
SOME NEWS.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.234
I DON'T KNOW
THE BEST WAY TO BREAK THIS.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.701
YOUR GREAT-UNCLE GUS?

02:47.735 --> 02:49.169
DEAD.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.275
- OH, NO.
I LIKED HIM.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.843
- YEAH. ME TOO.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.511
HEY, NUTS.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.717
- DEB, UNCLE GUS DIED.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.553
- OH, THAT'S TERRIBLE.

03:05.586 --> 03:06.354
WHAT HAPPENED?

03:06.387 --> 03:09.623
- HE HAD A HEART ATTACK.
HE WAS 94.

03:09.657 --> 03:12.426
- WE STILL HAVEN'T
RULED OUT FOUL PLAY.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.463
- THAT'S REALLY A SHAME.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.598
GUS WAS A SWEET GUY, HUH?
- YEAH.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.300
- REMEMBER HOW HE ALWAYS
WANTED TO READ

03:19.333 --> 03:20.834
EVERYTHING YOU WROTE?
- YEAH.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.304
AND HE GAVE ME A GOLD PEN
WHEN I GRADUATED.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.406
I ALWAYS FELT LIKE
I WAS HIS GRANDSON.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.541
- HE WANTS YOU
TO DELIVER HIS EULOGY.

03:27.575 --> 03:30.444
- WHAT?
I HARDLY KNEW THE GUY!

03:31.512 --> 03:33.614
- IT WAS HIS DYING WISH.

03:33.647 --> 03:36.550
- EVEN DEAD PEOPLE
LOVE RAYMOND.

03:36.584 --> 03:37.885
- LOOK, I CAN'T DO IT.
I CAN'T.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.853
GET SOMEBODY ELSE
TO DO IT.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.623
- NO.
OLD GUS WANTED YOU.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.024
IT WAS IN HIS WILL.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.393
- I CAN'T DO IT.

03:45.426 --> 03:46.627
LOOK, I CAN'T TALK
IN FRONT OF PEOPLE.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.296
EVEN TALKING TO YOU
IS HARD ENOUGH.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.863
I--NO.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.533
PLEASE, LET ROBERT DO IT.
ROBERT COULD DO THE EULOGY.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.335
- PEANUT, ALMOND, CASHEW.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.270
PEANUT, ALMOND--

03:56.304 --> 03:58.606
CASHEW.

03:58.639 --> 04:01.709
- I THINK YOU'RE DOING
THE EULOGY, RAY.

04:01.742 --> 04:02.643
[knocking]

04:04.678 --> 04:07.014
- OH, THIS IS TERRIBLE.
IT'S AWFUL.

04:07.047 --> 04:10.050
I JUST FOUND OUT THAT MY SISTER
IS COMING TO THE FUNERAL.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.785
- AUNT ALDA'S COMING
ALL THE WAY FROM CANADA?

04:11.819 --> 04:14.455
- UH-HUH!
- WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

04:14.488 --> 04:16.390
IF YOU LIKE AUNT ALDA.

04:16.424 --> 04:17.558
WHO DOES?

04:19.593 --> 04:20.728
- ALL RIGHT,
HAVE YOUR FUN.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.430
THAT WOMAN
BROKE MY HEART.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.064
- NOT THIS AGAIN.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.700
- SHE NEVER EVEN SENT RAYMOND
A WEDDING PRESENT.

04:26.734 --> 04:27.801
- WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
SHE WAS UPSET

04:27.835 --> 04:30.471
BECAUSE YOU PUT HER
AT A BAD TABLE AT THE RECEPTION.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.773
- HEY, AUNT ALDA DID
KIND OF RUIN THE WEDDING.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.842
- IT WAS SEVEN YEARS AGO,

04:34.875 --> 04:36.810
AND YOU'RE STILL
NOT TALKING.

04:36.844 --> 04:39.780
I HATE THIS STORY.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.049
- WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO, HUH?

04:42.082 --> 04:44.017
OUR COUSIN THERESA
HAS CATARACTS,

04:44.051 --> 04:45.619
SO SHE'S GOT TO
SIT UP FRONT.

04:45.653 --> 04:47.855
THEN SHE SHOWS UP
WITH HER DAUGHTER STACY,

04:47.888 --> 04:49.890
THE 300-POUND NUTRITIONIST.

04:49.923 --> 04:52.460
THAT'S ANOTHER TWO SEATS.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.429
- CAN HITLER
HAVE A JUICE BOX?

04:55.463 --> 04:57.431
- YEAH.
I'LL GET IT.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.901
- OH.
YOU UNDERSTAND, RAY.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.437
I KNOW YOU DO.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.839
YOU'RE SENSITIVE
AND ARTISTIC--

05:05.873 --> 05:08.476
- AHEM.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.511
- OH, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE SENSITIVE, DEAR.

05:10.544 --> 05:11.779
YOU'RE BIG.

05:14.382 --> 05:15.883
- LOOK, MA,
I UNDERSTAND YOUR FIGHT,

05:15.916 --> 05:17.618
YOU AND ALDA,
BUT LISTEN.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.020
MA, GUS IS DEAD,
AND I GOT TO GIVE THIS EULOGY,

05:20.053 --> 05:21.622
SO PLEASE, DON'T MAKE
TROUBLE AT THE FUNERAL.

05:21.655 --> 05:22.890
- I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE
TROUBLE FOR YOU

05:22.923 --> 05:24.925
OR ANYBODY ELSE.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.059
- GOOD.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.362
- BECAUSE I'M NOT
GOING TO BE THERE.

05:31.899 --> 05:35.035
- PEANUT, ALMOND, CASHEW.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.637
PEANUT, ALMOND, CASHEW.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.406
PEANUT, ALMOND--

05:43.076 --> 05:44.845
OH, THIS ISN'T GOOD.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.453
- "GUS."

05:52.486 --> 05:54.021
GUS--

05:54.054 --> 05:57.825
GUS, GUS, GUS.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.494
GUS.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.895
- HI.
HOW'S THE EULOGY COMING?

06:01.929 --> 06:03.464
- OH, I WISH I WERE GUS.

06:03.497 --> 06:04.932
- OH.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.700
- I CAN'T DO IT.
YOU SHOULD DO THIS.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.502
NO. YOU WERE IN P.R.

06:08.536 --> 06:10.738
YOU'RE GOOD AT BULL--
P.R.

06:12.172 --> 06:13.674
- GET UP. GET UP.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.743
I'LL--LOOK,
IT'S NOT THAT HARD.

06:15.776 --> 06:16.677
YOU JUST HAVE TO,
YOU KNOW,

06:16.710 --> 06:18.846
KNOW HOW TO PUT
THE RIGHT SPIN ON THINGS.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.482
JUST TELL ME
SOMETHING ABOUT GUS.

06:21.515 --> 06:22.616
- WHAT'S TO TELL?

06:22.650 --> 06:23.884
FOR THE LAST
30 YEARS,

06:23.917 --> 06:25.653
HE SAT IN FRONT
OF THE TELEVISION

06:25.686 --> 06:27.888
WITH A BOWL
OF BAKED BEANS.

06:29.156 --> 06:31.124
- HE WAS A GREAT
PATRON OF THE ARTS.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.826
ALL RIGHT.

06:32.860 --> 06:33.994
AND A GOURMET.

06:35.463 --> 06:36.697
TELL ME SOMETHING ELSE.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.131
- UH, HE COULD
BELCH THE ALPHABET

06:38.165 --> 06:41.201
TO THE LETTER "M."

06:41.234 --> 06:43.571
- A MAN OF LETTERS.

06:45.706 --> 06:46.440
- HEY, YOU'RE
VERY TALENTED.

06:46.474 --> 06:47.941
- THANK YOU.
- YEAH. COME HERE.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.409
- OOH.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.490
- DAD?

07:02.523 --> 07:03.824
- IT'S YOUR MOTHER.

07:03.857 --> 07:07.060
SHE WON'T STOP CRYING
ABOUT THIS ALDA BUSINESS.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.997
- SO WHY ARE YOU HERE?

07:10.030 --> 07:12.032
- WELL, SOMEBODY'S
GOT TO TALK TO HER.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.967
- WELL, YOU'RE HER HUSBAND.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.769
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

07:15.803 --> 07:18.005
- SHE SAYS I DON'T
UNDERSTAND HER.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.007
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
GO TALK TO HER?

07:20.040 --> 07:23.176
- 'CAUSE I DON'T
UNDERSTAND HER.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.712
RAY, YOU GO.

07:24.745 --> 07:25.713
- NO, DAD, NO.

07:25.746 --> 07:29.182
I GOT WORK TO DO HERE.
BIG EULOGY COMING UP.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.752
- WHAT, YOU DON'T CARE
HOW MUCH YOUR MOTHER SUFFERS,

07:31.785 --> 07:33.487
OR IF I STARVE?

07:33.521 --> 07:35.188
- OH, YOU'RE STARVING?

07:35.222 --> 07:37.024
- HEY,
YOU KNOW YOUR MOTHER.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.126
WHEN SHE GETS UPSET,
SHE DOESN'T COOK.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.695
WHEN SHE DOESN'T COOK,
I DON'T EAT.

07:41.729 --> 07:43.230
YOU DO THE MATH.

07:49.102 --> 07:49.837
[knock on door]

07:51.171 --> 07:53.874
- OH, HELLO, RAY.
- HI.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.576
- YOUR FATHER SEND YOU?

07:55.609 --> 07:57.811
- NO, NO.
I WANTED TO COME.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.112
I WON THE BET TO COME.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.048
- HUH.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.750
HE HATES IT
WHEN I CRY.

08:02.783 --> 08:06.053
IT REMINDS HIM
OF OUR WEDDING NIGHT.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.855
- HEY, IS THIS GUS?
- YEAH.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.623
- HEY, HE'S GOOD-LOOKING.
- UH-HUH.

08:09.657 --> 08:12.526
- GUYS CAN SAY THAT NOW.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.928
- I LOVED HIM. OH.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.998
OH, HERE WE ARE
AT CONEY ISLAND.

08:18.031 --> 08:21.535
- HEY, MA, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
COME TO THE FUNERAL,

08:21.569 --> 08:23.136
YOU KNOW, JUST
TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO GUS.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.272
- BE IN THE SAME ROOM WITH ALDA?
UH-UH.

08:25.305 --> 08:26.740
NOT EVEN IF IT WAS
YOUR OWN FATHER

08:26.774 --> 08:28.776
ROTTING IN THAT CASKET.

08:28.809 --> 08:29.777
FRUIT?

08:32.112 --> 08:34.314
- HEY, MA, WHAT'S WITH
THESE PICTURES, MA?

08:34.347 --> 08:36.049
WHERE ARE ALDA'S HEADS?

08:36.083 --> 08:38.051
- IN HERE,
WHERE THEY BELONG.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.119
- STOP, MA.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.989
WHAT, YOU GOING TO USE
HER HEADS TO COAT CHICKEN?

08:42.022 --> 08:43.824
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT ALDA
USED TO DO TO ME?

08:43.857 --> 08:45.959
HUH?
SHE'D READ MY DIARY.

08:45.993 --> 08:48.328
SHE'D PUT MY DOLLS
IN ODD POSES.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.730
SHE'D WEAR MY CLOTHES.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.198
SHE'D STEAL
MY BOYFRIENDS.

08:51.231 --> 08:55.636
- YEAH?
WHAT KIND OF POSES?

08:55.669 --> 08:57.070
- YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO GROW UP WITH SOMEONE

08:57.104 --> 08:59.673
WHO'S BOSSY, DEMANDING,
AND UNREASONABLE?

08:59.707 --> 09:02.175
- OH, NO.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.276
- WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

09:03.310 --> 09:05.579
- THAT'S A JOKE, MA.

09:05.613 --> 09:06.814
I'M MAKING A JOKE.

09:06.847 --> 09:09.883
- YEAH. HA, HA.
VERY FUNNY STUFF, YEAH.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.018
YOU THINK THIS IS
ALL A JOKE, HUH?

09:11.051 --> 09:13.353
- NO.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.255
- I THOUGHT
YOU UNDERSTOOD.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.924
- WELL, MA, I'M TRYING.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.191
LOOK, YOU'RE SISTERS.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.627
FAMILY SHOULD TALK.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.128
- LIKE YOU AND ROBERT?

09:21.161 --> 09:22.830
- WE TALK.

09:22.863 --> 09:26.166
A LOT OF THAT
JUST GOES UNSPOKEN.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.268
- YOU THINK I SHOULD
FORGIVE ALDA, IS THAT IT?

09:28.301 --> 09:31.138
- WELL, IT WOULD MAKE THINGS
A LOT EASIER ON YOU--

09:31.171 --> 09:33.373
AND OTHER PEOPLE
WHO HAVE EULOGIES TO GIVE.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.943
I'M JUST SAYING.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.145
- SURE, MAKE THINGS EASY
FOR EVERYBODY ELSE.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.280
DOES ANYBODY ASK ME
HOW I FEEL? HUH?

09:40.313 --> 09:41.949
I'M JUST A BURDEN.

09:41.982 --> 09:44.051
- NO, MA, YOU'RE NOT
JUST A BURDEN.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.321
- I GOT AN IDEA.

09:48.355 --> 09:49.657
HOW ABOUT I SIT
IN THE DUMPSTER

09:49.690 --> 09:51.291
BEHIND MR. BALDUCCI'S
BAKE SHOP?

09:51.324 --> 09:52.793
THAT WAY I CAN
SHOO THE CROWS AWAY

09:52.826 --> 09:54.127
FROM THE OLD CANNOLI.
- CANNOLI.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.863
AT LEAST, THAT WAY,
THEN I'D SERVE

09:55.896 --> 09:57.197
A PURPOSE.
- A PURPOSE.

09:59.867 --> 10:02.269
MA, YOU GOT
LOTS OF PURPOSES.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.771
I KNOW; WHY DON'T YOU
COOK DAD A STEAK?

10:03.804 --> 10:05.272
THERE'S A PURPOSE.

10:05.305 --> 10:08.909
MA--OH, MOM, PLEASE.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.077
I'M KIDDING, MA.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.846
MA, I'M JUST KIDDING!

10:12.880 --> 10:13.847
AW--

10:13.881 --> 10:15.248
[whimpers]

10:22.055 --> 10:24.424
- A NICE GAME-SAVING
TACKLE THERE.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.760
- I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS--
IT LOOKS TO ME-- YEAH, THEY ARE.

10:26.794 --> 10:29.763
THEY'RE LINING UP--
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:29.797 --> 10:31.765
- I'M--
I'M GETTING THE SCORES.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.266
- IS THAT HOW I RAISED YOU?

10:33.300 --> 10:34.802
HUH?

10:34.835 --> 10:37.137
PEOPLE CRY,
AND YOU TURN ON TELEVISION?

10:37.170 --> 10:39.807
- MA, I'M WAITING
FOR YOU TO COME BACK.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.742
- YOU COULDN'T COME AFTER ME,
SEE HOW I WAS?

10:41.775 --> 10:44.044
- I THOUGHT
YOU WANTED TO BE ALONE.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.412
- WHY WOULD YOU
THINK THAT, RAY?

10:45.445 --> 10:48.248
I RAN OUT OF HERE CRYING.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.383
- THAT'S THE PART
THAT THREW ME.

10:53.353 --> 10:56.056
LOOK, MA, AUNT ALDA'S
NOT THAT BAD.

10:56.089 --> 10:59.059
COME ON, THERE'S TWO SIDES
TO EVERY STORY, RIGHT?

11:02.796 --> 11:04.064
- GET OUT OF MY HOUSE.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.332
- OH, STOP IT.
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.800
- GET OUT OF MY HOUSE,
RAYMOND.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.068
- OH, DON'T BE MAD
AT ME NOW, MA.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.703
I GOT EULOGY PROBLEMS.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.972
MA, IF YOU DON'T FORGET
ABOUT THIS ALDA STUFF--

11:13.774 --> 11:16.276
NOBODY AT THIS FUNERAL'S
GOING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME!

11:26.486 --> 11:27.420
- OH, LOOK AT ALL THE PEOPLE.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.322
THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.124
- ARE YOU STILL NERVOUS
ABOUT THE EULOGY?

11:31.158 --> 11:32.893
LISTEN, DO YOU WANT
TO PRACTICE ON ME?

11:32.926 --> 11:35.162
- NO, NO, YOU SHOULD
BE SURPRISED

11:35.195 --> 11:36.930
LIKE THE REST OF US.

11:36.964 --> 11:38.999
- YOU DIDN'T FINISH IT?
- HOW COULD I?

11:39.032 --> 11:41.468
I GOT ALL THIS TROUBLE
WITH MY MOM.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.937
SHE THREW ME OUT OF THE HOUSE.
SHE'S NOT TALKING TO ME.

11:43.971 --> 11:46.439
I KNOW, IT SOUNDS
LIKE A DREAM COME TRUE.

11:50.110 --> 11:53.380
- OHH--
LOOK AT GEOFFREY.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.849
OH, MAN.

11:55.883 --> 11:58.151
THINK ANYBODY
WILL NOTICE?

11:58.185 --> 12:00.087
- AAAAAHH!

12:04.792 --> 12:06.726
- BRIDE'S SIDE
OR GROOM'S SIDE?

12:15.568 --> 12:17.404
I'M LIGHTENING THE MOOD.

12:21.074 --> 12:21.975
- LISTEN--

12:22.009 --> 12:24.812
JUST TRY NOT TO MAKE
THAT NOISE YOU MAKE.

12:24.845 --> 12:25.745
- WHAT NOISE?

12:25.779 --> 12:28.048
- THAT NOISE THAT
YOU MAKE AT FUNERALS.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.918
- OH, YEAH, I GOT THAT
UNDER CONTROL. THANKS.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.321
- OH, LOOK,
YOUR MOM'S HERE.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.555
- OH, GOD.
SHE SHOWED UP.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.792
- OH, LOOK AT
MY SWEETIES. HI!

12:38.826 --> 12:40.093
- LISTEN, MA,

12:40.127 --> 12:42.762
I'M GLAD YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND,
AND I'M SORRY.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.367
- GREAT JOB
TALKING TO YOUR MOTHER.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.137
GOD FORBID
YOU SHOULD GIVE A CRAP.

12:52.873 --> 12:55.542
- OOH, I GUESS MARIE'S
STILL NOT COOKING.

12:55.575 --> 12:58.011
I'LL GIVE HIM A JAR
OF STRAINED PEAS.

12:59.512 --> 13:02.315
- IS THAT MY RAYMOND?

13:02.349 --> 13:04.084
- OH, HI, AUNT ALDA.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.552
- HO, HO, HO!

13:10.223 --> 13:12.059
OHH, OHH--

13:12.092 --> 13:15.428
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE
MY FAVORITE NEPHEW AGAIN.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.563
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.365
- OHH, IT'S BEEN
WAY TOO LONG.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.566
GOT TO GO.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.270
- SHAME, SHAME, SHAME.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.205
- WELL, HELLO, MARIE.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.373
- LOOK, ISN'T THIS NICE,
YOU TWO?

13:26.406 --> 13:27.975
YOU'RE BACK TOGETHER.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.242
- YOU CAN KISS MY SON,

13:29.276 --> 13:31.478
BUT YOU CAN'T SEND HIM
A WEDDING PRESENT?

13:31.511 --> 13:33.847
YOUR LIPS SHOULD
DRY INTO RAISINS.

13:33.881 --> 13:36.149
WHOOPS! TOO LATE.

13:36.183 --> 13:39.152
- AW, HEY, BE NICE.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.855
- THE PRESENT WILL BE HERE
IN A COUPLE OF YEARS.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.523
I MAILED IT
FROM WHERE I SAT.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.492
- THE ONLY REASON YOU'RE
ANGRY ABOUT THAT TABLE

13:45.525 --> 13:47.861
IS BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T
THE CENTER OF ATTENTION.

13:47.895 --> 13:49.863
- HEY, LOTS OF
ATTENTION HERE.

13:49.897 --> 13:52.432
- HOW COULD I BE
THE CENTER OF ATTENTION

13:52.465 --> 13:54.301
WHILE YOU'RE
DOING THE LIMBO

13:54.334 --> 13:57.104
IN A SEQUIN DRESS
AND A PUSH-UP BRA?

13:57.137 --> 13:59.006
- OH, HEY.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.073
- MAYBE IF YOU HAD
SOMETHING TO PUSH UP,

14:00.107 --> 14:03.443
YOU WOULDN'T BE SITTING THERE
WITH A SOUR PUSS.

14:03.476 --> 14:06.446
- HOW COULD YOU SEE MY SOUR PUSS
WHERE I WAS SITTING?

14:06.479 --> 14:08.381
YOU'D NEED BINOCULARS.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.050
- AW, PLEASE,
NOW STOP IT!

14:10.083 --> 14:12.385
STOP IT!
WE'RE AT A FUNERAL.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.154
- RAY--

14:14.187 --> 14:15.388
WE'RE READY FOR YOU NOW.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.257
- OH, GOD.
LISTEN, MA, JUST STOP IT.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.226
PUT IT ON HOLD,
ALL RIGHT?

14:19.259 --> 14:22.029
THIS FUNERAL'S NOT ABOUT
YOU TWO FIGHTING.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.998
IT'S ABOUT ME
GIVING THIS DAMN EULOGY.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.133
SIT HERE.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.170
- I LIKE HIS HAIR.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.604
- HIS HAIR
LOOKS TERRIBLE.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.142
- HI.

14:35.175 --> 14:38.378
I'M RAY.

14:38.411 --> 14:42.415
UH, I'M HERE TO TALK
ABOUT GUS PETRONE.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.251
- [braying]

14:57.397 --> 14:58.431
- THANK YOU.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.269
UH, DID A LITTLE--

15:02.302 --> 15:05.305
DID A LITTLE RESEARCH
FIRST.

15:05.338 --> 15:06.439
LOTS OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW

15:06.473 --> 15:11.478
GUS WAS ACTUALLY BORN
GUSTAFAVIO--PI--

15:11.511 --> 15:13.613
PICA--

15:13.646 --> 15:16.016
PI--CCCHHH--

15:19.119 --> 15:20.553
PICHIALU.

15:25.192 --> 15:29.229
HE WAS BORN
JANUARY 23, 1902.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.498
THAT WOULD MAKE HIM, WHAT?

15:31.531 --> 15:34.434
AQUARIUS.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.702
HI.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.106
OKAY.

15:39.139 --> 15:41.608
UH, HE WAS 10 POUNDS,
6 OUNCES.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.476
WOW.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.512
NOW, THAT'S BIG.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.114
LADIES, AM I RIGHT?

15:53.086 --> 15:55.522
WELL--LATER,

15:55.555 --> 15:59.392
GUS BOUGHT CARPET WORLD
OVER IN MANHASSET.

15:59.426 --> 16:00.393
I REMEMBER--

16:00.427 --> 16:04.431
I REMEMBER IT WAS OPEN
10:00 TO 6:00 SUNDAYS.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.698
YEAH.

16:07.567 --> 16:08.668
HE WAS GREAT.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.443
IN 1992, GUS
WAS FORCED TO RETIRE

16:16.476 --> 16:20.180
AFTER A BAD BREAK
WITH HIS PROSTATE.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.049
[sighing]

16:22.082 --> 16:23.283
AW, THIS IS INCRED--

16:23.316 --> 16:24.284
I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.254
THIS IS CRAZY.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.056
LISTEN.

16:29.089 --> 16:32.125
YOU KNOW WHAT I REMEMBER
ABOUT GUS?

16:32.159 --> 16:35.028
HOW MUCH HE CARED
ABOUT FAMILY.

16:35.062 --> 16:37.197
YEAH, YEAH.

16:37.230 --> 16:37.797
YEAH, HE DIDN'T LET
THE LITTLE THINGS

16:37.830 --> 16:38.931
BECOME BIG THINGS,

16:38.965 --> 16:43.570
'CAUSE HE KNEW WHAT WAS
MOST IMPORTANT IN LIFE: FAMILY.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.072
PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU,

16:45.105 --> 16:48.141
NO MATTER HOW STUPID
YOU'RE ACTING.

16:49.842 --> 16:53.546
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE ONE DAY
WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE GUS HERE.

16:53.580 --> 16:54.414
HUH? IS THAT
WHAT YOU WANT?

16:54.447 --> 16:55.482
YOU WANT TO GET LOWERED
INTO THE GROUND

16:55.515 --> 16:58.285
WITH ALL THE GRUDGES
AND THE PETTY LITTLE THINGS

16:58.318 --> 17:00.787
THAT DON'T MATTER AT ALL?

17:03.323 --> 17:05.158
GUS DIDN'T LET THAT
HAPPEN TO HIM.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.097
THAT'S WHY
WE'RE ALL HERE TODAY.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.337
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S ALL.

17:17.370 --> 17:23.310
[applause]

17:26.346 --> 17:27.780
SORRY ABOUT THE YELLING.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.619
- RAYMOND,
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL:

17:32.652 --> 17:34.154
SIMPLE AND TOUCHING.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.089
- IT WAS
MORE THAN BEAUTIFUL.

17:36.123 --> 17:38.791
IT WAS--
EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL.

17:38.825 --> 17:41.261
- WHAT IS YOUR
PROBLEM, MARIE?

17:41.294 --> 17:44.531
I CAN'T EVEN SAY A WORD
WITHOUT YOU TOPPING ME.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.833
- I CAN'T HELP IT.
YOU'RE EASILY TOPPED.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.370
- YOU'RE A BITTER WOMAN,
MARIE.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.705
YOU'RE A BITTER,
BLEACHED-BLONDE WOMAN.

17:52.739 --> 17:55.342
- OHH!

17:55.375 --> 17:58.445
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS
OF HUMAN HAIR.

18:01.348 --> 18:02.315
AT LEAST I DON'T SIT
AROUND COMPLAINING

18:02.349 --> 18:05.185
ABOUT WHERE I SAT AT A WEDDING
SEVEN YEARS AGO.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.487
- I WAS SO FAR AWAY!

18:07.520 --> 18:10.457
I AM STILL WAITING
FOR MY CAKE.

18:11.724 --> 18:14.327
- THAT LOUSY CAKE WAS STALE.
- YEAH.

18:14.361 --> 18:15.128
[crowd mumbling]

18:15.162 --> 18:17.430
- STALE?
YOU TOOK TWO PIECES HOME.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.866
- BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
INVITE MY KIDS.

18:21.468 --> 18:25.772
- WHO ELSE GOT COLD VEAL?
all: YEAH.

18:25.805 --> 18:28.275
- AND THE PORTIONS
WERE SO SMALL.

18:28.308 --> 18:29.742
- FRANK!
all: YEAH.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.212
- COOK ME SOMETHING,
WILL YOU?

18:32.245 --> 18:33.746
- AND THE BAND STANK, MARIE.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.282
- OKAY, YEAH.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.849
AND WHAT ABOUT
THOSE CHEAP CENTERPIECES?

18:36.883 --> 18:39.386
AND THE CHAMPAGNE WAS FLAT.

18:39.419 --> 18:42.489
- ALL RIGHT! STOP IT!
ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!

18:42.522 --> 18:43.856
STOP!

18:43.890 --> 18:46.159
- [braying]

18:59.539 --> 19:02.342
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU AND YOU.

19:02.375 --> 19:05.412
LET'S GO.
NOW! NOW!

19:07.780 --> 19:08.815
- WELL, WHAT IS IT, RAY?

19:08.848 --> 19:11.251
- WHAT IS IT?
OH, WHAT IS IT?

19:11.284 --> 19:13.220
COME HERE AND SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN.

19:13.253 --> 19:16.589
BOTH OF YOU,
COME HERE AND SIT DOWN.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.291
DIDN'T YOU HEAR
WHAT I SAID IN THERE?

19:18.325 --> 19:19.459
- YOU MEAN THE EULOGY?

19:19.492 --> 19:21.594
- YES!

19:21.628 --> 19:25.198
- YOU KNOW HOW I MENTIONED
IT WAS EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL?

19:25.232 --> 19:28.435
THAT WASN'T
ENTIRELY TRUE.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.970
- MA, YOU WANT TO BE
IN THAT BOX, DEAD,

19:31.003 --> 19:32.772
WITHOUT EVER MAKING UP
WITH AUNT ALDA?

19:32.805 --> 19:35.342
- HOW COME I'M IN THE BOX
AND NOT HER?

19:35.375 --> 19:36.876
- ANSWER!

19:36.909 --> 19:38.811
- OHH--I DON'T KNOW.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.647
- AUNT ALDA?

19:40.680 --> 19:45.652
- THANK YOU FOR NOT PUTTING
ME IN THE BOX, DEAR.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.954
- COME ON, SO YOU NEVER
WANT TO MAKE UP WITH MOM?

19:49.889 --> 19:51.624
- WELL, I GUESS--

19:51.658 --> 19:53.726
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.495
- BEAUTIFUL, TWO "I DON'T
KNOWS;" THAT'S PROGRESS.

19:55.528 --> 19:58.231
SO YOU LIKE--YOU LIKE
BEING THIS WAY?

20:01.268 --> 20:04.904
- I--ALWAYS THOUGHT
THERE WAS TIME.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.806
- HOW MUCH TIME IS THERE?

20:09.008 --> 20:10.643
THIS IS THE TIME, NOW.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.412
NOW IS THE TIME.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.848
DO IT.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.604
- I'M SORRY, MARIE.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.839
- IT WAS MY FAULT.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.949
- SEVEN YEARS.

20:49.982 --> 20:52.319
- ALL THAT TIME WASTED.

20:52.352 --> 20:54.454
SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.389
- OH, MY GOD.
THEY MADE UP?

20:56.423 --> 20:57.390
- YEAH.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.891
- YOU DID THIS?

20:58.925 --> 21:02.429
- I CAN--DO THINGS.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.531
- I HAD MENOPAUSE.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.533
- ME TOO.

21:06.566 --> 21:10.437
- FIRST A BEAUTIFUL
SPEECH, NOW THIS--

21:10.470 --> 21:13.973
RAY, I AM COMPLETELY
TURNED ON.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.643
- OH, SURE, AT A FUNERAL.

21:18.545 --> 21:20.046
- HI.

21:20.079 --> 21:22.615
- OH, HOW ARE YOU
DOING, DEAR?

21:22.649 --> 21:26.619
- WELL, I'M GOOD
IF YOU GUYS ARE GOOD.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.821
- OH, THANKS TO RAYMOND,
I'VE GOT MY SISTER BACK.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.857
WHAT'S NOT GOOD?

21:30.890 --> 21:34.026
- WELL, GUS IS DEAD.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.996
- THERE IS THAT.

21:37.029 --> 21:40.433
- WELL, AS LONG AS
EVERYBODY IS MAKING UP,

21:40.467 --> 21:41.901
I FORGIVE YOU TOO,
AUNT ALDA.

21:41.934 --> 21:44.971
- FOR WHAT, DEAR?

21:45.004 --> 21:46.873
- YOU KNOW, THE WEDDING.

21:46.906 --> 21:48.508
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, DEAR?

21:48.541 --> 21:50.643
- OH, DEBRA, DEBRA--

21:50.677 --> 21:52.779
- WELL, ALL THOSE COMPLAINTS
ABOUT WHERE YOU WERE SEATED

21:52.812 --> 21:55.715
AND NOBODY DANCING,
EVERYBODY GOING HOME EARLY.

21:55.748 --> 22:00.553
- OH, THAT WAS BECAUSE
OF THE CHEAP FOOD.

22:00.587 --> 22:03.122
- YOU NEVER EVEN
SENT A GIFT.

22:03.155 --> 22:06.526
- MY GIFT WAS
THAT I CAME AT ALL.

22:06.559 --> 22:09.095
- WHAT KIND OF A HORSE'S ASS
GIFT IS THAT?

22:11.531 --> 22:13.833
- YOU'D BE LUCKY TO HAVE
A HORSE'S ASS!

22:13.866 --> 22:15.635
- OHH!

22:15.668 --> 22:16.503
- THEY'RE GOING TO BLOW.
LET'S GO.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.104
- OH, RAYMOND,
SEE WHAT SHE'S DOING?

22:18.137 --> 22:19.572
NO, YOU SEE, YOU'VE
BEEN DOING THAT--

22:19.606 --> 22:22.074
SEVEN YEARS?
IT'LL BE 70 YEARS!

22:25.912 --> 22:27.847
- SOME FUNERAL, HUH?

22:27.880 --> 22:28.881
- YEAH.

22:29.949 --> 22:31.984
- SAD.
- HMM.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.453
- YOU WANT TO DO IT?

22:33.486 --> 22:34.353
- TSK.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.462
I MIGHT.
