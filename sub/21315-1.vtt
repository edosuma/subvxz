<i>Dr. Branson, please call 5914.</i>

00:37.371 --> 00:39.873
<i>Dr. Branson, please call 5914.</i>

00:56.557 --> 01:00.644
<i>It's like, every time you turn
on the TV or look at a magazine,</i>

01:00.727 --> 01:04.772
<i>it's, "Oh, my God,
this cake is so delicious."</i>

01:04.855 --> 01:06.525
<i>And, like, your reward or something.</i>

01:06.608 --> 01:10.862
And then, you turn the page,
and there's some sad, fat "before" girl,

01:10.946 --> 01:13.448
and she's all, "I hate myself."

01:13.532 --> 01:15.409
And then, the thin "after" girl goes,

01:15.492 --> 01:17.853
"I did this diet, and now I'm happy,
and everyone loves me."

01:17.911 --> 01:19.871
What about the chocolate cake?

01:19.955 --> 01:21.957
It's like they're trying
to drive us crazy.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.917
"Society's to blame.

01:24.918 --> 01:29.214
The world is so unfair. I have to die."

01:29.298 --> 01:31.341
There's no point in blaming everybody.

01:32.509 --> 01:33.593
Live with it.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.972
Ellen, do you think there's a way
you can express that

01:37.055 --> 01:39.016
without discounting Penny's feelings?

01:48.984 --> 01:50.861
<i>♪ It's not the end ♪</i>

01:50.944 --> 01:52.738

Bitch.

02:14.134 --> 02:17.304

02:58.428 --> 03:03.392
Oh, my God. Look at you.
Your parents are gonna kill you.

03:03.475 --> 03:08.063
No more trips to TJ, Rosa.
I think they put cement in your lips.

03:09.398 --> 03:11.733
Your mom said,
"Take the room in the garage."

03:11.817 --> 03:14.152
There's a room in the garage now?

03:14.236 --> 03:17.823
Every time I come home, you have
a new face and there's more house.

03:17.906 --> 03:21.326
- It was gonna be your mother's office.
- She's not my mother.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.550
Dinner is half an hour!

03:36.633 --> 03:39.761
- Your father and mother are eating out.
- Okay.

03:42.681 --> 03:45.809
- Are you on that dating app again?
- No. Come on, what?

03:45.892 --> 03:49.438
- You know what I'm doing. Come on.
- Oh.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.732
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:51.815 --> 03:54.860
All right, go. Get ready.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.195
- All right, ready?
- Mm-hmm.

03:57.279 --> 03:59.948
280 for the pork,
350 for the buttered noodles,

04:00.031 --> 04:03.160
125 for the buttered beans,
150 for the roll, and 50...

04:03.243 --> 04:06.621
No, 75 for butter.

04:08.832 --> 04:12.043
- You got it. All of it. Dang.
- Yes.

04:12.127 --> 04:14.379
Oh, my God.
It's like you have calorie Asperger's.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.964
- I mean, hold the applause.
- You're a pro.

04:17.048 --> 04:20.552
Okay, wait. Now, so how many...
how many calories you think boogers have?

04:20.635 --> 04:22.095
Ay, don't say that.

04:22.179 --> 04:24.264
What? She probably knows.
You know, right?

04:28.518 --> 04:32.731
- Not just the beans, the meat.
- I'd say snot's pretty low.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.859
Maybe, like, five to ten,
depending on the size of the pickin's.

04:35.942 --> 04:36.943
- The meat.
- Mm-hmm.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.821
And you are both being disgusting.

04:41.782 --> 04:42.824
"The meat."

04:45.035 --> 04:48.455
You know, you used to have a jar
that you kept all your boogers in?

04:48.538 --> 04:49.978
- No, I didn't.
- You absolutely did.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.124
- You probably did.
- Hello!

04:51.208 --> 04:55.212
- Stop. No, I didn't.
- Sorry we couldn't pick you up.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.671
Work.

04:58.924 --> 05:02.719
Mmm. Did you get settled in?

05:03.845 --> 05:07.474
So, Jack is very upset with you.
He's very worried.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.976
Why doesn't Jack tell me himself?

05:10.060 --> 05:12.729
Your father would rather
you and I have this talk, okay?

05:14.231 --> 05:15.941
Right.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.652
It's not that he doesn't care.
He cares too much.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.321
You don't know.

05:22.739 --> 05:27.452
The doctor said you were defiant
and a bad influence on the other girls.

05:27.536 --> 05:30.789
Is this what it's gonna be now?
Are you proud of yourself?

05:30.872 --> 05:32.165
I'm maintaining.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.004
I have to weigh you.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.565
The agreement was you could live here

05:39.589 --> 05:42.133
as long as you kept up
your end of the bargain.

05:42.217 --> 05:45.029
- You wanna go back to your mother's?
- Mom moved to Phoenix with Olive.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.414
Yeah, that's what I mean. Phoenix.

05:46.471 --> 05:49.182
We can put you on the bus,
first thing tomorrow.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.076
Jesus.

06:08.159 --> 06:11.997
- I had that cold, and I...
- I don't wanna hear it. Get on.

06:16.001 --> 06:20.171
- It's not at zero.
- Stop. Stop it. Get on.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.094
God.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.220
Okay.

06:29.347 --> 06:30.682
Turn towards me.

06:38.356 --> 06:41.735
Do you see that?
Do you see what you look like?

06:43.028 --> 06:44.028
Yeah.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.699
Do you think that's beautiful?

06:49.034 --> 06:50.076
No.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.622
So, what are you gonna do about it?

06:57.375 --> 07:01.296
Jesus Christ. We can't do this again.
I can't do this again.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.585
You have a car now, right?

07:41.753 --> 07:42.753
Yeah.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.256
What?

07:48.093 --> 07:51.221
You're using me to burn off
half a pack of lifesavers or some shit.

07:51.304 --> 07:55.308
- The view is best at the top.
- Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

07:56.726 --> 08:01.106
Hey, look. Don't tell anyone, okay?

08:02.315 --> 08:04.567
- A butterfly tattoo?
- Yeah.

08:04.651 --> 08:05.944
Were you drunk?

08:07.153 --> 08:11.241
- No. Butterflies are classic.
- They're retarded.

08:11.324 --> 08:15.620
Okay, I'm sorry I didn't have
your artistic eye to advise me,

08:15.704 --> 08:17.747
so I got a retarded butterfly.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.166
I mean, it's pretty.

08:23.461 --> 08:28.008
Dad and Susan are gonna kick me out,
or drag me to that treatment.

08:29.551 --> 08:31.761
- Okay, so eat.
- I eat.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.307
You know
that I love you like a full sister,

08:36.390 --> 08:39.561
but you look like absolute crap.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.520
And every time I ask you why you do this,

08:41.604 --> 08:45.900
I always get
some stupid non-answer from you.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.069
At least, I'm a cheap date.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.363
That stuff goes further
on an empty stomach.

08:55.243 --> 08:57.829
I've got it under control.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.416
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.337
How many people
do you think are down there?

09:08.715 --> 09:10.300
Like, two million?

09:14.345 --> 09:18.600
I bet a bunch of them who are about to die
just said the exact same thing.

09:26.858 --> 09:31.404
- That's not breakfast.
- Neither is coffee. Dad home?

09:32.655 --> 09:34.324
He had an early meeting.

09:35.950 --> 09:36.993
Hey.

09:42.373 --> 09:44.209
You have a choice.

09:44.292 --> 09:47.045
There's one last person
that we want you to see, a specialist.

09:47.128 --> 09:50.006
- It wasn't easy getting an appointment...
- I think I will call my mom.

09:50.090 --> 09:53.510
- I should at least try Phoenix.
- We spoke to your mother last night.

09:53.593 --> 09:58.139
She says it's not a good time
for her to take this on.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.517
But she sends hugs.

10:38.638 --> 10:42.392
Now, you know me, I enjoy people,
but your mother is selfish.

10:42.475 --> 10:46.271
Do you think we wanted to stay
in the Valley? North Hollywood.

10:46.354 --> 10:52.819
But... with this and school for you
and Kelly, only thing we can afford.

10:52.902 --> 10:56.906
Not that I... love the Westside.
You can never find parking.

10:58.491 --> 11:03.163
Well, at least on our side,
we have Pier 1, which I love.

11:03.246 --> 11:06.166
Over there at the Grove,
all you have is Cost Plus World Market.

11:06.249 --> 11:08.001
I mean, all that is just junk.

11:08.084 --> 11:10.170
You too? Was it hard
getting an appointment?

11:11.337 --> 11:13.590
We were on the waiting list
for six months.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.885
Six months?
Ooh, it wasn't that long for us.

11:16.968 --> 11:19.470
I guess word is out
about his success rate.

11:19.554 --> 11:22.348
So, I hear that his methods
are a little unconventional.

11:22.432 --> 11:27.395
They're quite radical. But we've tried
everything else. Renfrew, Maudsley.

11:27.478 --> 11:31.524
Maudsley? Ooh, you're brave.
Was that a nightmare?

11:33.401 --> 11:35.278
It took a long time getting used to it.

11:42.702 --> 11:46.372
- Does that really work?
- No, I'm just thirsty.

11:49.167 --> 11:54.422
How old are you, anyway? Your mom said
you had to drop out of college.

11:54.505 --> 11:58.009
Twenty. And she's not my mom.

11:58.092 --> 12:01.387
Twenty, wow.
And you're some kind of artist?

12:01.471 --> 12:05.642
Your... Well, that lady said
you're kind of famous.

12:05.725 --> 12:06.726
She's nuts.

12:07.727 --> 12:12.065
But you had, like, a crazy fan
or something.

12:14.651 --> 12:20.782
Susan, my stepmom, has a reality problem.
You get one letter, you have a crazy fan.

12:20.865 --> 12:23.493
Seriously? She made it sound like
you had a stalker or something.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.621
Yeah. Not even.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.623
She said she was taking
the anti-depressants,

12:28.706 --> 12:30.184
but she'd been flushing them
down the toilet.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.894
She was afraid
they would make her gain weight.

12:31.918 --> 12:37.674
And I know, she has a right to lash out.
Her mother Judy, she is a bipolar lesbian.

12:37.757 --> 12:41.094
- That is not why...
- Judy has had several breakdowns,

12:41.177 --> 12:43.471
hospitalizations.

12:43.554 --> 12:45.306
Poor Ellen had to call us one time

12:45.390 --> 12:48.226
because her mother was writing
her own bible on the walls.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.269
Judy came out when Ellen was 13.

12:50.353 --> 12:54.649
The child is going through puberty,
and overnight, she's got two moms?

12:54.732 --> 12:58.695
Traumatic. It has got to have something
to do with the weight and...

12:58.778 --> 12:59.988
Sounds rough.

13:01.072 --> 13:05.451
But looking for one reason is
a losing battle. It's never that simple.

13:05.535 --> 13:09.580
Absolutely. I say that to her father
all the time. He blames himself.

13:09.664 --> 13:14.043
Now, I think throwing Ellen
into the deep end, real life...

13:14.127 --> 13:15.586
might do her some good.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.088
My family was on welfare.

13:17.171 --> 13:21.217
- We had nothing.
- Okay, thank you. I think I got it.

13:26.097 --> 13:30.268
- You do a lot of sit-ups.
- Not that many.

13:30.351 --> 13:33.771
It wasn't a question. That's where
you get these bruises on your spine.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.942
Your stepmom always talk that much?

13:40.361 --> 13:42.947
You know how sharks have
to keep swimming or they'll die?

13:44.073 --> 13:45.575
She's kinda like that with talking.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.916
Take a deep breath.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.626
Let it out.

13:58.212 --> 14:02.216
Again.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.342
And one more.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.267
When was the last time
you got your period?

14:13.186 --> 14:14.186
God.

14:16.064 --> 14:17.148
Um...

14:19.192 --> 14:21.235
It must have been...

14:22.278 --> 14:23.696
A long time ago.

14:26.199 --> 14:29.494
I don't feel... that unhealthy, you know?

14:31.037 --> 14:34.123
If I wanna be thin,
don't they say that that's better?

14:35.124 --> 14:36.626
I'll outlive the normies.

14:36.709 --> 14:41.672
- You like this? The furry?
- What? No, I'm not...

14:41.756 --> 14:45.301
Lanugo. Your body's trying
to keep you warm by making more hair.

14:46.302 --> 14:47.553
But you know that, right?

14:49.889 --> 14:53.101
I talk to kids like you all day,
every day.

14:53.184 --> 14:56.813
So, I know that you are,
as a rule, full of shit.

14:56.896 --> 15:01.192
You're not thin. You scare people.
And I'm guessing you like that.

15:01.275 --> 15:04.237
But the way that you're going,
one day, you won't wake up.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.573
And I'm not going to treat you
if you aren't interested in living.

15:09.951 --> 15:10.993
Good speech.

15:11.077 --> 15:14.872
If I'm going to help you,
you have to agree to a few things.

15:16.374 --> 15:19.669
- What?
- No talk about food.

15:19.752 --> 15:23.381
I'm not interested.
It's boring and not very helpful.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.425
And your parents can't talk
about it either.

15:25.508 --> 15:28.970
- You're on your own, understand?
- Yes.

15:29.053 --> 15:32.056
You'll agree to a minimum
of six weeks in-patient.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.891
I don't need more in-patient.

15:36.853 --> 15:38.729
Then find another doctor.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.379
<i>- Well?
- He wants to admit me on Monday.</i>

15:45.403 --> 15:48.281
He said that? He said he'll admit you?

15:49.490 --> 15:52.994
This is great! What exactly did he say?

15:55.121 --> 15:57.206
Is Dad coming?

15:58.374 --> 16:01.794
Uh, you know, we didn't have much time
to talk, but he's on his way home.

16:01.878 --> 16:02.879
Dad's coming?

16:02.962 --> 16:04.380
Mm...

16:04.464 --> 16:07.717
- He's on his way, but he said not to wait.
- So, he's not coming.

16:10.052 --> 16:13.973
Hey, what happened to that sweet girl
that I met at Transitions?

16:15.558 --> 16:17.810
- The Mexican.
- Angel?

16:17.894 --> 16:20.730
- Mm-hmm.
- Her mom's from El Salvador.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.315
You know what I mean.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.818
You two seemed very close. And I just...

16:26.861 --> 16:29.405
I want you to know
that it's fine if you were.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.162
- Thank you, Susan.
- Jesus, Mom.

16:36.245 --> 16:39.457
Just because her mom is gay
does not mean that she's gay.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.542
You know, you can get married now.

16:41.626 --> 16:45.004
I'm not saying you are.
I'm just saying, you know, if you...

16:46.255 --> 16:47.798
if you have that kind of turmoil,

16:47.882 --> 16:50.968
then you might feel
like you don't deserve to eat.

16:51.052 --> 16:52.261
Pussy, you mean.

17:04.941 --> 17:08.736
Are you done? I've got a special dessert.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.864
Yup, all done. Thanks.

17:13.532 --> 17:17.161
Well, I'm so sorry Dad couldn't be here
for your lesbian coming out party.

17:17.244 --> 17:20.373
It really sucks.
I mean, I believe it, but...

17:20.455 --> 17:21.958
No, I'm... I'm fine.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.713
Will you try... this time?

17:28.798 --> 17:32.969
I mean, maybe this doctor is really great.
Can you please just try this time?

17:35.263 --> 17:36.264
Ta-da!

17:40.268 --> 17:41.394
Isn't it funny?

17:43.396 --> 17:44.522
It's a cake.

17:46.440 --> 17:49.318
<i>With the syrup
and the nuts, it was literally heaven.</i>

17:49.402 --> 17:51.362
<i>Life in these arctic temperatures
is measured</i>

17:51.445 --> 17:53.489
<i>by the briefest moments of light...</i>

18:00.496 --> 18:04.750
- This is it? You're sure?
- Yeah, this is the address.

18:07.003 --> 18:08.462
Oh, hi.

18:09.547 --> 18:10.923
- Oh, that's okay.
- Please.

18:11.007 --> 18:14.051
- So I can get my points.
- Okay.

18:17.054 --> 18:20.016
- So, what's your name?
- Ellen.

18:21.183 --> 18:26.939
Anna. Bulimia nervosa.
Although, more nervosa than bulimia now.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.358
That's Kendra.

18:34.655 --> 18:39.368
Here you go. Welcome to Threshold.
I'll, uh... I'll go get Lobo.

18:40.411 --> 18:42.622
Lobo!

18:42.705 --> 18:45.708
This is... very nice, homey.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.336
Hey.

18:48.419 --> 18:51.088
Uh, hi, are you Lobo?

18:51.172 --> 18:54.258
Lucus. Like "mucus."

18:56.302 --> 18:58.554
But I prefer "Luke." Lobo is a dame.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.724
- A dame?
- A broad, a skirt.

19:02.767 --> 19:05.645
Raymond Chandler is my muse
since I got here.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.980
To the hardscrabbled streets
of LA, that is.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.190
- Oh.
- Wow.

19:09.273 --> 19:14.236
- I'm from London, originally.
- London? How interesting.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.697
Did you come all this way for Dr. Beckham?

19:16.781 --> 19:20.368
By way of Jersey. It's a sordid tale.

19:20.451 --> 19:24.288
- But he's the best, so...
- Well, Ellen's from Los Angeles.

19:24.372 --> 19:27.708
- How interesting.
- Not really.

19:37.093 --> 19:40.680
Well... see you around, sweetheart.

19:48.688 --> 19:49.730
God.

19:50.773 --> 19:54.068
He seemed nice, funny.

19:54.151 --> 19:57.613
Here we go. Nothing fancy. That's Pearl.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.449
Anna's in here too,
when she's not running around.

20:02.827 --> 20:05.454
We usually have six patients,

20:05.538 --> 20:07.540
but, right now, we have seven
because of Luke.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.375
- He's down the hall.
- I like your pants.

20:10.584 --> 20:13.170
Oh. Thanks.

20:13.254 --> 20:16.215
I, uh... like your ponies.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.259
Thanks.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.596
Sorry.

20:23.639 --> 20:24.890
It's gross.

20:24.974 --> 20:29.854
Oh, this girl from the last place I was in
had a permanent tube in her stomach.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.731
She refused to chew.

20:31.814 --> 20:34.108
Ew. I chew.

20:35.609 --> 20:40.072
So, I'm gonna have to search this.
Any knives or X-Actos I should know about?

20:40.156 --> 20:42.867
- Are you cutter?
- Nope, not that on-trend.

20:44.827 --> 20:47.455
- Some of these girls are cutters?
- Oh, yeah.

20:47.538 --> 20:49.373
We have a lot of overachievers in here.

20:52.710 --> 20:55.546
- I'm gonna have to take these.
- It's just a multivitamin.

20:55.629 --> 21:00.384
It's a vitamin bottle.
Could be diet pills, speed, laxatives...

21:00.468 --> 21:04.764
And we don't have time to test
for everything. We'll give you a vitamin.

21:04.847 --> 21:06.932
And can I have your phone, please?

21:09.268 --> 21:12.021
Do you have any other
electronic devices? iPad?

21:12.104 --> 21:15.316
My iPad doesn't even have wireless.
I just use it to draw.

21:15.399 --> 21:19.111
Dr. Beckham says you should draw
on paper until he says different.

21:19.195 --> 21:23.407
- God, what did you say to him?
- I just explained the situation.

21:24.909 --> 21:27.328
Okay. Um...

21:27.411 --> 21:30.080
I should let you get settled, right?

21:30.164 --> 21:33.459
Uh, is Dr. Beckham here?
I'd like to just pop in before I go.

21:33.542 --> 21:36.712
He's only here in the morning
and usually stops by after dinner.

21:37.755 --> 21:40.382
I just thought you should know
about her tricks.

21:40.466 --> 21:43.052
Oh. We know all the tricks.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.054
That's why we don't have any doors.

21:45.137 --> 21:48.933
They know we'd jog around the room
all day if nobody could see us.

21:49.016 --> 21:51.227
It'd be like the Rexie Olympics
up in here.

21:51.310 --> 21:56.899
Okay. Call us if you need anything,
and, um... we'll see you soon, okay?

21:56.982 --> 21:58.901
- Be good.
- Okay.

21:58.984 --> 22:02.363
Not too good. Not perfect.

22:02.446 --> 22:03.446
Got it.

22:05.282 --> 22:06.492
I got it.

22:19.421 --> 22:22.675
Pearl usually gives the tour,
but, obviously, she's not going anywhere.

22:22.758 --> 22:25.219
So, Luke is your guy.

22:25.302 --> 22:30.683
- Ellen, Luke.
- We've met. Onward.

22:33.269 --> 22:38.691
This, as you can see, is a living room.

22:38.774 --> 22:41.569
We meet here twice a day
for "Bitch and Bawl."

22:41.652 --> 22:42.695
What?

22:42.778 --> 22:44.446
It's what we call our group therapy.

22:44.530 --> 22:47.866
- Well, it's what I call group therapy.
- And what's the deal with levels?

22:47.950 --> 22:50.452
I prefer to think of them
as draconian points

22:50.536 --> 22:52.413
earned for good behavior.

22:52.496 --> 22:56.166
Like when you were little
and you had chores, if you had chores.

22:56.250 --> 22:59.587
This is the torture chamber,
also known as the dining room.

22:59.670 --> 23:01.297
Chores, uh, which I never had

23:01.380 --> 23:03.661
because that would assume
I had parents who gave a shit...

23:03.716 --> 23:07.678
- So, you do chores to get points?
- Among other things, yes.

23:07.761 --> 23:11.307
And Lobo and the other nurses
and counselors can give them

23:11.390 --> 23:12.975
or take them away at will.

23:13.058 --> 23:15.185
Amass enough points, level up.

23:15.269 --> 23:18.689
Earn extra privileges, like, you can
go out of the house on your own.

23:18.772 --> 23:22.443
I'm actually currently deciding
on where to go on my next outing.

23:22.526 --> 23:28.032
So far, I've eaten at nine of the places
on Jonathan Gold's essential 100 list.

23:28.115 --> 23:30.993
Jonathan Gold is my muse.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.329
Raymond Chandler was your muse
a few minutes ago.

23:33.412 --> 23:39.001
I know. Isn't that fantastic?
Nobody can keep up with me.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.753
Onward.

23:40.836 --> 23:43.964
So, welcome
to our new house member, Ellen.

23:44.048 --> 23:45.633
- Hi.
- Hi, Ellen.

23:45.716 --> 23:46.550
Hello.

23:46.634 --> 23:49.386
So, how this works...
This is just an end of day check-in.

23:49.470 --> 23:51.680
The morning sessions
are a little more focused.

23:51.764 --> 23:55.893
This is just to talk about struggles
and our victories and...

23:55.976 --> 23:58.937
any other issues you might be having
here in the house.

23:59.938 --> 24:00.981
Let's start with Pearl.

24:04.860 --> 24:05.944
Struggle...

24:07.404 --> 24:14.662
I got tubed today,
and, uh... you know, it hurts.

24:14.745 --> 24:16.997
Now, I feel all...

24:18.374 --> 24:19.375
hot.

24:21.335 --> 24:24.713
I can't stop thinking
about how many calories are in that drip.

24:24.797 --> 24:27.091
- They won't say.
- Fifteen hundred.

24:29.593 --> 24:32.262
I looked it up.
I was tubed a couple times.

24:32.346 --> 24:33.531
Ellen, we try not to crosstalk.

24:33.555 --> 24:37.142
We don't talk about numbers
or weight or anything like that.

24:37.226 --> 24:39.353
- Sorry.
- Fifteen hundred?

24:39.436 --> 24:43.732
How are you feeling
right now, Pearl? It's okay.

24:43.816 --> 24:46.110
I don't know. Just...

24:49.571 --> 24:52.116
that it's hard getting better.

24:52.199 --> 24:55.994
And I'm guessing that you're worried
about how you're gonna be burning it off,

24:56.078 --> 24:57.879
especially when everybody's here
watching you?

24:59.039 --> 25:00.499
Do you know why you feel that way?

25:02.793 --> 25:07.256
- Because I... have an addiction?
- In a way, yes.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.925
When the exercise and the rituals kick in

25:10.008 --> 25:13.429
and... the cyclical thoughts
about weight take over,

25:13.512 --> 25:15.556
everything else goes away.

25:15.639 --> 25:18.559
And starving yourself
can make you feel euphoric,

25:18.642 --> 25:21.645
like a drug addict or an alcoholic.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.524
It's not about "thin enough," right?

25:25.607 --> 25:28.068
There's no "thin enough."
It doesn't exist.

25:28.152 --> 25:33.198
What you crave is the numbing
of the thing that you don't wanna feel.

25:33.282 --> 25:34.950
And we give you a lot of rope here.

25:35.033 --> 25:40.748
It's scary, but only you can decide...
to see what's good, to be alive.

25:40.831 --> 25:42.875
- You understand?
- Kind of.

25:44.251 --> 25:47.045
- I'm trying.
- Yeah, you are.

25:49.131 --> 25:50.382
Talk to me, brother.

25:50.466 --> 25:54.845
My victory was leading
a fantastic house tour...

25:54.928 --> 25:56.054
and earning another point,

25:56.138 --> 25:59.975
which means I get to go to Guelaguetza,
Oaxacan restaurant,

26:00.058 --> 26:03.687
number 26 on Mr. Gold's essential 100.

26:03.771 --> 26:10.319
And affordable, which is also essential.
Ballet companies don't pay you a fortune.

26:10.402 --> 26:13.614
That's great.
Talk to me about your struggles.

26:13.697 --> 26:16.784
Don't know, really. I guess
I'm obsessing about my injury

26:16.867 --> 26:19.995
and... if I'll be able to perform
when I get get out of here.

26:20.078 --> 26:23.499
- But I've got a goal. So, that's good.
- You have a couple of goals.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.585
Eating Oaxacan and getting healthy
so you can dance again.

26:26.668 --> 26:29.838
Damn straight.
I've got goals coming out my wazoo.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.090
Ellen?

26:35.093 --> 26:37.471
Struggle, um...

26:39.223 --> 26:41.016
Coming here.

26:41.099 --> 26:43.936
I mean,
accepting that I have to come here.

26:44.019 --> 26:47.356
So, maybe your victory
is that you're here.

26:48.607 --> 26:49.607
Hmm?

26:51.443 --> 26:52.486
Yeah, maybe.

27:08.418 --> 27:11.213
Did Luke explain about meals?

27:11.296 --> 27:14.633
No. By the time we got to that,
he was onto some musical thing.

27:14.716 --> 27:17.761
<i>- ♪ Sugar blues ♪
- That.</i>

27:17.845 --> 27:22.391
<i>♪ Everybody's singin' the sugar blues ♪</i>

27:22.474 --> 27:24.726
<i>- ♪ Sugar blues ♪
- Luke.</i>

27:27.896 --> 27:29.898
Eat what you want.

27:29.982 --> 27:33.402
If you have special food,
like Kendra here does, that's fine.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.070
- We'll get it for you.
- That's it?

27:35.153 --> 27:39.658
No, you're definitely judged.
When you eat, points magically appear.

27:39.741 --> 27:42.345
What he means is, if you're maintaining
or moving towards your goal,

27:42.369 --> 27:43.370
you go up a level.

27:43.453 --> 27:45.205
- How you do it is up to you.
- Really?

27:45.289 --> 27:47.791
Yeah, but no one leaves the table
at mealtime,

27:47.875 --> 27:49.877
and bathrooms are locked
for 30 minutes after.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.296
And there's no point pretending to eat

27:52.379 --> 27:55.465
or throwing up into the plants
or whatever.

27:55.549 --> 27:58.594
It smells, and it doesn't end up
on the scale.

27:58.677 --> 27:59.761
Got it.

28:01.597 --> 28:03.682
- Thank you, Lobo.
- De nada.

28:04.892 --> 28:08.687
- All right. Who wants to say grace?
- Oh, sorry.

28:14.067 --> 28:16.778
- Dear Jesus...
- Take us to church.

28:16.862 --> 28:22.743
Allah, Oprah, <i>My Little Pony,</i>
<i>or whoever your personal savior is...</i>

28:22.826 --> 28:26.455
help us to give our bodies what they need
to grow strong and beautiful

28:26.538 --> 28:30.959
because every single person
at this table deserves to live.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.128
- Mm.
- Amen.

28:33.211 --> 28:34.212
Bon appétit.

28:36.590 --> 28:37.590
Oh, yeah.

28:39.301 --> 28:43.222
Oh, my God.
This is so fucking good. Oh, my God.

28:47.517 --> 28:48.517
Pearl?

28:53.190 --> 28:56.610
You freaked her out with the 1500 thing.
I mean, it's not <i>your</i> fault...

28:56.693 --> 28:58.880
- I didn't mean...
- Oh, no, no, no. It's not your fault.

28:58.904 --> 29:00.239
I mean, don't stress.

29:01.573 --> 29:04.993
- How many in-patients have you done?
- Four.

29:05.077 --> 29:09.623
Six. The rest of these guys,
they have no idea.

29:11.291 --> 29:16.171
I mean, Pearl's not actually just upset
about the tube. She might get kicked out.

29:16.255 --> 29:20.425
Seriously? I mean, she looks pretty sick.

29:20.509 --> 29:23.262
No, Dr. Beck says that hospitals
are for sick people.

29:23.345 --> 29:25.055
We're here to get over that shit.

29:28.183 --> 29:29.476
Ice cream's my favorite.

29:29.559 --> 29:32.271
- It comes up the easiest.
- How do you know you got it all?

29:32.354 --> 29:34.523
When your barf is clear
and it doesn't burn anymore.

29:34.606 --> 29:38.193
Oh. I wish I could barf.
I'm only good at the binging part.

29:40.612 --> 29:44.866
- You purge?
- I tried. It's not my thing.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.286
So, how do you get rid of it
if you can't barf?

29:47.369 --> 29:49.288
- It's gross.
- Tell me.

29:56.169 --> 30:01.717
Your ponies wouldn't want you to cry.
Hello Kitty wouldn't want you to cry.

30:03.802 --> 30:08.140
The unicorn on the stairs
wouldn't want you to cry.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.399
Hey, there.

30:17.482 --> 30:19.818
- Settling in?
- Yeah.

30:21.153 --> 30:24.323
- Where's everyone else?
- May I?

30:25.782 --> 30:26.782
Okay.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.079
Anna went to the movies.

30:32.789 --> 30:33.957
Points.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.419
Cool.

30:37.502 --> 30:41.340
I'm having your family come in
for a group session tomorrow afternoon.

30:41.423 --> 30:43.008
It's standard when I see new patients.

30:43.091 --> 30:45.344
If it's productive,
we'll do it from time to time.

30:46.511 --> 30:47.596
Okay.

30:48.889 --> 30:51.516
- Even my mom?
- Even Mom.

30:52.851 --> 30:53.727
Wow.

30:53.810 --> 30:56.188
I told her it takes me longer
to drive in from the Valley

30:56.271 --> 30:57.773
than it does to fly from Phoenix.

31:02.486 --> 31:03.528
Okay, kiddo.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.114
Glad you're here.

31:09.743 --> 31:10.786
I didn't mean it.

31:12.245 --> 31:16.625
I... I mean, I didn't mean
for my drawings to do what they did.

31:17.918 --> 31:20.754
- What?
- On Tumblr.

31:20.837 --> 31:25.759
I know Susan told you what happened,
and... it'll come up, I bet.

31:27.135 --> 31:28.178
Right.

31:29.596 --> 31:32.516
I was just doing
what all my teachers told me to do.

31:32.599 --> 31:34.059
Draw what you know?

31:34.142 --> 31:37.187
- Yeah.
- I hear you.

31:37.270 --> 31:41.650
Just keep it for yourself, for now, okay?

31:43.068 --> 31:44.068
Okay.

31:45.487 --> 31:46.487
Good night.

32:22.691 --> 32:24.484
Oh. Sweaty.

32:24.568 --> 32:28.780
I ran home from the movies.
Don't tell anyone.

32:28.864 --> 32:30.115
Okay.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.910
- What movie did you see?
- Oh, um...

32:33.994 --> 32:36.997
They were playing <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>
<i>at the New Beverly with Zombieland.</i>

32:37.080 --> 32:38.790
- No way.
- Yeah.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.793
Emma Stone's kinda fat.
Don't you think?

32:41.877 --> 32:44.504
Oh, no, I think she's just big-boned.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.632
She's, like, at least, a size six.

32:49.843 --> 32:53.054
- Anyway, 'night.
- 'Night.

33:05.275 --> 33:07.194
Mutually assured destruction.

33:08.320 --> 33:09.779
Right.

33:14.868 --> 33:17.621
I'm breaking 120 today, dolls.

33:17.704 --> 33:23.126
- Is that going up or down?
- Up. Eighty-nine when I came in.

33:23.210 --> 33:25.504
Eighty-nine? How tall are you?

33:28.882 --> 33:30.842
You're a beautiful unicorn.

33:32.135 --> 33:34.846
- You, cheer captain, come on.
- All right.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.015
Let's do this.

33:40.810 --> 33:44.189
Megan's been gaining. She's flipping out.

33:44.272 --> 33:48.610
But, I mean, she wants to,
I think, for her baby.

33:48.693 --> 33:52.572
- She... She's pregnant?
- Oh, nobody said?

33:52.656 --> 33:55.075
- Jesus, I didn't even think about...
- I know.

33:55.158 --> 33:58.036
That's why Luke calls her "the unicorn."

33:58.119 --> 34:02.541
She gets her period once and gets pregnant
off some guy she barely knows.

34:05.544 --> 34:06.878
I'm never having a baby.

34:08.463 --> 34:09.547
No way.

34:13.467 --> 34:14.469
Where are you?

34:17.054 --> 34:19.683
That's probably Dad, right?

34:19.766 --> 34:22.893
- Making some excuse.
- Yeah, annoying.

34:24.062 --> 34:27.274
- I heard them fighting this morning.
- Great.

34:28.315 --> 34:29.315
That's great.

34:37.199 --> 34:40.120
Oh, my God.

34:40.203 --> 34:42.038
Oh, my God.

34:42.121 --> 34:43.123
Mom...

34:44.541 --> 34:46.418
You... You look like a ghost.

34:48.628 --> 34:49.628
It's okay.

34:51.590 --> 34:52.591
Why?

34:55.635 --> 34:57.679
Mom, it's okay, it's okay.

34:57.762 --> 34:59.472
My God.

35:01.558 --> 35:04.603
- No dad?
- I'm sorry, work.

35:06.438 --> 35:08.607
Well, he has to support his family...

35:08.690 --> 35:12.444
and pay alimony, still,
and the medical bills and...

35:12.527 --> 35:13.527
Understood.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.282
Bet you didn't expect
this much "gynergy" today.

35:18.450 --> 35:21.870
I do think this is a record number
of mothers for one patient.

35:25.582 --> 35:29.461
Okay, I want everybody to understand
nobody's on trial here.

35:31.129 --> 35:33.048
I just want to get a sense of the family.

35:36.760 --> 35:39.054
Well, until recently, Ellen lived with us.

35:39.137 --> 35:42.474
She moved in with her father
18 months ago.

35:42.557 --> 35:45.602
We thought it might be good for her
to heal that relationship.

35:45.685 --> 35:48.605
He's shown little interest
in who Ellen really is.

35:48.688 --> 35:51.316
He's only interested
in who he wants her to be.

35:51.399 --> 35:55.278
Ellen is an artist.
She's extremely bright and sensitive.

35:55.362 --> 35:58.782
She was never going to go into Chinese

35:58.865 --> 36:00.867
- or computers or what have you.
- What?

36:00.950 --> 36:03.286
Is that what you think
your dad wants for you?

36:05.705 --> 36:10.502
I don't know. I guess... I think he just
wants me to be able to make a living.

36:10.585 --> 36:14.297
- Exactly. Is that a crime?
- No crimes, remember?

36:14.381 --> 36:18.134
The point is, Ellen's father
never saw who she was.

36:18.218 --> 36:19.761
He left when she was very young...

36:19.844 --> 36:22.764
Yeah, because you were sleeping
with your best friend over there.

36:22.847 --> 36:25.488
- No, that's not why the marriage ended.
- There's a better reason?

36:25.558 --> 36:27.769
We are not here
to defend our relationship.

36:27.852 --> 36:30.247
When are you going to come up
with a different narrative, Susan?

36:30.271 --> 36:32.041
- What narrative?
- What narrative?

36:32.065 --> 36:33.668
- Susan...
- No, this is the truth.

36:33.692 --> 36:36.736
- Jack didn't wanna have sex.
- Well, he likes it with me just fine.

36:36.820 --> 36:39.447
- Twice a week, like clockwork.
- Oh, my God.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.825
Besides, he's not the one
who abandoned her.

36:41.908 --> 36:43.952
We did not abandon Ellen.
We moved to Phoenix.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.705
They threw her out.
They put her bags on the street.

36:46.788 --> 36:50.709
Because we'd been dealing
with Ellen's illness alone for years.

36:50.792 --> 36:53.670
I didn't abandon my daughter.
I love her more than life.

36:53.753 --> 36:57.048
I just didn't know what to do.
She's dying right in front of us.

37:00.343 --> 37:02.637
What's going on with you right now?

37:10.353 --> 37:11.396
I'm sorry...

37:14.357 --> 37:16.401
that I'm not a person anymore.

37:16.484 --> 37:17.652
I'm a problem.

37:22.824 --> 37:25.160
- And it's all my fault.
- Fuck fault.

37:26.453 --> 37:31.916
Fault and blame have no place here.
Only how you wanna live, moving forward.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.084
Who you wanna be.

37:40.091 --> 37:44.137
How about you, Kelly?
What do you think of all this?

37:45.430 --> 37:47.182
Um... I, uh...

37:49.934 --> 37:52.020
I feel kind of angry, I guess.

37:53.938 --> 37:56.024
I just... I just don't really...
Really get it.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.526
You know, just... eat.

38:00.361 --> 38:03.549
I don't know. It's just like... It's not
her life that she's just missing out on.

38:03.573 --> 38:04.573
It's...

38:07.494 --> 38:10.288
It's my life, too.
You know, I don't get to have...

38:11.873 --> 38:12.873
a sister.

38:16.586 --> 38:20.715
You know, I look at pictures
of my prom and stuff, and...

38:22.550 --> 38:25.094
and all I think of is, like,
"Oh, that's when...

38:25.178 --> 38:27.347
Ellen was in the hospital," or...

38:27.430 --> 38:29.849
"That's when she fainted on the bus."

38:29.933 --> 38:30.933
All right.

38:32.101 --> 38:35.063
And all of my friends,
they think that she's some kind of freak.

38:35.146 --> 38:38.316
- Like, a freak who killed a girl.
- Because of the blog?

38:38.399 --> 38:40.401
- Tumblr.
- Yeah, and that's bad enough,

38:40.485 --> 38:44.113
but now, people wanna be like her
and look like her

38:44.197 --> 38:46.115
and go through what she's going through.

38:46.199 --> 38:48.409
Nobody died
because of Ellen's artwork, okay?

38:48.493 --> 38:51.538
There's plenty of stuff out there
for people to fetishize.

38:51.621 --> 38:55.208
But that certainly didn't help,
to have notoriety for starving...

38:55.291 --> 38:56.417
But that's what I'm saying.

38:56.501 --> 38:58.479
- Ellen has talent.
- I didn't say she doesn't.

38:58.503 --> 39:01.714
But if you hadn't made her
take her artwork away from her audience,

39:01.798 --> 39:02.983
she might have found her voice.

39:03.007 --> 39:06.511
Ellen took it down herself
after that young woman died

39:06.594 --> 39:08.888
because she knew
it was the right thing to do.

39:08.972 --> 39:11.158
- You are so full of shit, Susan.
- What?

39:11.182 --> 39:12.942
Do you even hear what Judy is saying?

39:12.976 --> 39:14.056
A young women died.

39:14.102 --> 39:16.187
- No, no, no.
- Meet me in the car.

39:20.692 --> 39:24.863
I'm sorry, we just...
We just can't take you with us right now.

39:27.574 --> 39:29.454
- We're gonna miss our plane.
- Okay, all right.

39:29.534 --> 39:30.952
- All right?
- Okay.

39:31.035 --> 39:34.455
Ellen... be strong, okay?

39:45.675 --> 39:48.028
Hey, I'm really sorry
if I got you in any sort of trouble...

39:48.052 --> 39:52.724
- Please, no, I'm sorry. I hate that...
- No, no, no, it's... it's whatever.

39:52.807 --> 39:54.017
You can forget it.

39:56.603 --> 39:59.522
What a shit-show.

40:01.774 --> 40:05.486
You really need to get better so you never
have to see those people ever again.

40:14.329 --> 40:15.496
If you die...

40:17.206 --> 40:18.333
I will kill you.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.507
Okay. I'll see you.

40:32.055 --> 40:33.055
See ya.

40:52.784 --> 40:55.203
- Dinner.
- I'm staying up here.

40:56.204 --> 40:59.958
You don't have to eat, but the rule
is that everyone has to sit down.

41:39.163 --> 41:41.249
<i>Have you been thinking
about baby names?</i>

41:41.332 --> 41:42.166
Not yet.

41:42.250 --> 41:45.670
I have a whole list of favorites
that you can have.

41:45.753 --> 41:48.339
I was actually considering a new moniker.

41:48.423 --> 41:52.468
- What about Dean or Tex?
- When I get out of the first trimester.

41:52.552 --> 41:54.446
Do you want to get out
of the first trimester?

41:54.470 --> 41:57.015
- Jesus, Luke.
- Stay out of this, Mia.

41:57.098 --> 42:01.185
This is between us rexies.
She knows what I'm talking about.

42:01.269 --> 42:07.233
I don't know. I'm terrified.
It just feels so... out of control.

42:07.316 --> 42:09.610
But it's kind of a miracle, you know?

42:09.694 --> 42:14.532
'Cause I didn't think anything
was working down there. So, maybe...

42:16.075 --> 42:17.785
I'm supposed to have this baby.

42:20.913 --> 42:21.956
And I want to.

42:23.499 --> 42:26.878
I just want to think about something
besides me for once.

42:26.961 --> 42:28.212
Amen, sister.

42:28.296 --> 42:31.716
- We should have a baby shower.
- No, I don't wanna jinx it.

42:31.799 --> 42:34.552
- No, please. A shower would be so cute.
- Yeah, no.

42:37.221 --> 42:38.556
All right, fine. Maybe.

42:38.639 --> 42:41.601
- If I get past 12 weeks.
- Yay!

42:42.643 --> 42:47.065
Well, we're gonna help you make it past.
Every bite you take feeds the miracle.

42:49.984 --> 42:51.652
Pass the potatoes.

42:53.988 --> 42:55.174
- Oh, my God...
- Are you sure?

42:55.198 --> 42:56.616
- I don't know.
- Here they are.

42:56.699 --> 42:58.242
- Just don't talk.
- Here they are.

42:58.326 --> 43:01.454
- Miracle potatoes.
- Miracle, miracle potatoes.

43:01.537 --> 43:03.081
- I like that.
- Pretty good.

43:05.124 --> 43:07.335
How about the newbie? How you doin'?

43:09.212 --> 43:10.254
Finished.

43:14.926 --> 43:18.262
- What happened?
- She had family therapy today.

43:19.514 --> 43:21.265
- Oh.
- Makes sense.

43:21.349 --> 43:22.391
Mm-hmm.

43:22.475 --> 43:26.062
Hey. I missed dinner.

43:26.145 --> 43:27.730
I found your barf stash.

43:31.400 --> 43:35.321
Keep this to yourself
and I'll get you some laxatives.

43:35.404 --> 43:38.116
- I don't... I don't use...
- Come on, I know you want them.

43:39.158 --> 43:41.911
You think I haven't seen
that thing that you do?

43:41.994 --> 43:43.454
What thing?

43:46.791 --> 43:50.628
Making sure your arm doesn't get bigger
than, what, a silver dollar?

43:53.714 --> 43:54.715
Deal.

44:20.700 --> 44:21.909
Cigarette for dinner.

44:23.286 --> 44:25.538
- That's not gonna get you points.
- Not in the mood.

44:27.290 --> 44:28.290
Okay.

44:31.919 --> 44:34.964
And who in hell made you
house den mother?

44:35.047 --> 44:37.425
You walk around here
like you've got it all figured out.

44:37.508 --> 44:39.177
Well, if you're so fixed and special,

44:39.260 --> 44:41.137
why don't you go back
to New Jersey or London

44:41.220 --> 44:42.541
or wherever the fuck you're from?

44:42.597 --> 44:46.559
I am going back,
as soon as my BMI's closer to my age.

44:46.642 --> 44:48.728
But right now,
I'd rather try and help people

44:48.811 --> 44:50.479
than mope about feeling sorry for myself.

44:50.563 --> 44:52.440
You have no idea how I'm feeling.

44:52.523 --> 44:55.610
- I never said I did.
- And what? You wanna help people?

44:55.693 --> 44:57.236
What are you, a doctor now?

44:57.320 --> 45:00.698
- You feel pretty proud of yourself?
- Yeah, I am, actually.

45:00.781 --> 45:03.534
I'm moving the needle
in the right direction.

45:03.618 --> 45:05.161
Sorry if that scares you.

45:05.244 --> 45:07.997
But people actually go home sometimes
and have a life,

45:08.080 --> 45:10.291
even people with fucked-up families.

45:12.126 --> 45:15.671
Yeah. There goes
that fucking excuse again, huh?

46:11.727 --> 46:12.727
Enter.

46:14.647 --> 46:15.815
Hey.

46:18.275 --> 46:22.530
- Hey.
- Don't be all pleased with yourself.

46:22.613 --> 46:26.409
Wow. I never thought I'd meet anyone
more defensive than I am.

46:26.492 --> 46:27.492
And yet...

46:28.953 --> 46:30.287
So, you've been here awhile.

46:32.039 --> 46:33.040
Six months.

46:34.709 --> 46:38.004
- Is that you?
- Hard to believe, I know.

46:38.087 --> 46:42.508
I didn't mean that...
Yeah, I can tell that it's you.

46:42.591 --> 46:44.719
Incredible.

46:44.802 --> 46:48.597
You know what it's like to be 19
and feel like you've already peaked?

46:48.681 --> 46:49.807
Um, a relief.

46:52.018 --> 46:57.982
No. I loved it.
I could push it and push it.

46:58.065 --> 47:01.569
And then I broke
and went batshit, obviously.

47:02.862 --> 47:06.073
But my knee's getting better,
and my company director says

47:06.157 --> 47:09.660
he'll have a place for me
as soon as I get my act together, so...

47:09.744 --> 47:12.288
- It's my drawing.
- Yeah.

47:13.539 --> 47:16.709
I printed it off your Tumblr,
like, a year ago.

47:16.792 --> 47:19.712
That's why I acted like such a spaz
when you first got here.

47:19.795 --> 47:21.547
- You're like my...
- You're muse?

47:21.630 --> 47:22.673
Shut up.

47:25.426 --> 47:27.845
I just figured, somebody so talented,

47:27.928 --> 47:30.931
I had to be brilliantly charming
to get you to like me.

47:31.015 --> 47:34.435
- Well, you overshot.
- I'm aware.

47:35.478 --> 47:38.647
In my defense, though,
I've been running on empty for so long

47:38.731 --> 47:43.027
that when I actually eat now,
I get this crazy burst of energy.

47:43.110 --> 47:47.239
- That's why you're so weird.
- I'm always weird. That's why I'm...

47:48.657 --> 47:49.700
assertive.

47:51.035 --> 47:58.417
How do you do it? Eat.
I mean, I see you, and I just... I get...

47:58.501 --> 48:03.756
I get all panicky even thinking about it,
like, the world is gonna fall apart.

48:03.839 --> 48:08.552
I feel that way. But you know,
feel the fear and do it anyway.

48:08.636 --> 48:11.263
Yeah, but aren't you scared
you won't be able to stop?

48:11.347 --> 48:13.682
- That you're just gonna...
- Be like one of those guys

48:13.766 --> 48:17.103
who has to be lifted out of his bed
with a crane?

48:17.186 --> 48:20.189
Yeah, but Dr. Beck says
that's not gonna happen, so...

48:20.272 --> 48:24.026
- Yeah, but he has to say that.
- Well, he's pretty straight-up.

48:24.110 --> 48:26.695
Plus, I'm not gonna lie.
I'm really fuckin' hungry.

48:27.822 --> 48:30.157
Like, two years worth of hungry.

48:32.076 --> 48:36.205
Whenever I can't sleep, I draw food.

48:36.288 --> 48:38.958
Oh, yeah? Like... what?

48:39.041 --> 48:42.169
- Do you know what a Goo Goo Cluster is?
- Oh, my God.

48:43.379 --> 48:46.757
Yeah, greatest candy bar ever.

48:46.841 --> 48:51.679
Peanuty, marshmallowy greatness.

48:51.762 --> 48:55.599
Oh, it's 240 calories there,
110 from fat.

48:55.683 --> 48:57.852
Whoa. Calorie Asperger's.

48:59.019 --> 49:03.149
- Maybe.
- My last meal would be a whole box of 'em.

49:03.232 --> 49:07.278
Oh, yeah?
How would you eat them? Show me.

49:10.698 --> 49:11.740
You wish.

49:13.742 --> 49:16.704
Um, right. Well, I'd better...

49:16.787 --> 49:18.122
Right, right, right. Yes.

49:19.373 --> 49:21.709
- See you tomorrow?
- Where else would I be?

49:23.127 --> 49:24.127
Good night.

49:28.465 --> 49:29.465
Epic.

49:34.680 --> 49:36.223
Step on.

49:36.307 --> 49:38.726
- Unless you wanna face the other way.
- No, I'm good.

49:40.144 --> 49:42.479
I didn't sew rocks into my panties,
if you're worried.

49:43.480 --> 49:44.523
I'm not.

49:54.200 --> 49:55.201
Step off.

49:57.620 --> 49:59.622
Wow, that's bad.

50:02.249 --> 50:05.252
You know what the body burns
after there's no more fat?

50:05.336 --> 50:08.964
Muscle. Organ tissue.

50:09.048 --> 50:11.648
Pretty soon, you're gonna be
flopping around like a boneless fish.

50:13.510 --> 50:16.513
Thanks for that.
Yeah, I'm scared straight.

50:20.351 --> 50:21.852
Anna, you're next!

50:26.565 --> 50:27.900
I want a baby dragon.

50:35.032 --> 50:37.243
- Megan?
- Huh?

50:37.326 --> 50:40.204
- What do you think?
- It's good.

50:40.287 --> 50:41.747
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

50:41.830 --> 50:42.915
Okay, I'll finish it.

50:45.542 --> 50:47.044
I told her not to.

50:50.381 --> 50:51.882
You feel anything?

50:54.176 --> 50:55.176
Not yet.

50:56.053 --> 51:01.517
I like what you said before...
about thinking more about somebody else.

51:01.600 --> 51:02.643
Yeah.

51:04.395 --> 51:09.817
I think that's what being a mom
is supposed to be about... you know?

51:09.900 --> 51:13.487
- Putting the kid first.
- Yeah.

51:13.570 --> 51:17.074
Yeah, it's not like I know
what I'm talking about, but...

51:17.157 --> 51:19.743
No, I... I think you do.

51:22.246 --> 51:24.748
- You're gonna be a good mom.
<i>- ♪ Sugar blues ♪</i>

51:24.832 --> 51:29.503
- Thank you.
<i>- ♪ Everybody's singing the sugar... ♪</i>

51:30.504 --> 51:31.504
Huh.

51:35.551 --> 51:37.177
Good evening, ladies.

51:37.261 --> 51:39.096
- Good evening.
- Hi, Luke.

51:39.179 --> 51:41.724
Oh, wh...

51:41.807 --> 51:44.560
What is...? What's that noise?

51:44.643 --> 51:48.814
You hear that?
It's so weird. I feel like there's, uh...

51:48.897 --> 51:51.150
Oh...

51:51.233 --> 51:52.693
Oh.

51:57.114 --> 51:58.866
You know you want it.

51:58.949 --> 52:00.617
Shh!

52:00.701 --> 52:03.370
Okay, don't make it a sex thing.

52:03.454 --> 52:06.206
It is a sex thing. Don't pretend it's not.

52:07.207 --> 52:08.207
Ready?

52:10.085 --> 52:11.337
Oh...

52:15.007 --> 52:16.133
Oh, there it is.

52:17.176 --> 52:19.470
- I... I can't.
- You can.

52:19.553 --> 52:25.726
Chew, swallow.
The world will not implode, I swear.

52:26.852 --> 52:29.855
Come on, do it.

52:29.938 --> 52:30.939
Do it.

52:33.734 --> 52:34.735
Do it.

52:40.491 --> 52:43.285
- God.
- Right?

52:43.369 --> 52:44.661
- Hmm.
- Touch it.

52:44.745 --> 52:47.414
We can hear you, freak.

52:47.498 --> 52:52.378
- Yeah, freak, don't be so gross.
- Come on, just a little. Get it on you.

52:52.461 --> 52:55.089
Come on, get it on you.

53:00.928 --> 53:02.971
Right? Okay.

53:03.055 --> 53:06.767
Now, a little bite... for me.

53:07.935 --> 53:09.895
- For you?
- Mm-hmm.

53:09.978 --> 53:13.315
I didn't even like you
until five minutes ago, so, like...

53:13.399 --> 53:16.652
- Maybe just, you know, not...
- You like me.

53:16.735 --> 53:18.278
- You like me.
- Shut up.

53:18.362 --> 53:19.988
- She likes me.
- Shut up.

53:20.072 --> 53:23.200
- Don't press your luck.
- She likes me. You like me.

53:23.283 --> 53:24.743
- Take a bite.
- Can we be done?

53:24.827 --> 53:27.913
- You like me. Come on. Have a little bite.
- Okay, seriously, back off!

53:31.291 --> 53:32.334
God...

53:35.379 --> 53:37.172
Coward.

53:39.174 --> 53:41.552
Tomorrow, you bite.

53:50.769 --> 53:52.479
Luke just made me touch chocolate.

53:54.523 --> 53:58.068
- He's so weird.
- He's totally weird sometimes.

54:05.826 --> 54:10.080
I think the baby just moved.
Smell that. Yeah, get in on that.

54:10.164 --> 54:13.667
- Is anybody watching this movie?
- Nobody cares about dragons.

54:13.750 --> 54:16.170
How are you doing
after family therapy?

54:16.253 --> 54:18.653
It's pretty much how it always is
when my folks are together.

54:18.714 --> 54:21.008
- Minus your dad.
- Like I said.

54:22.217 --> 54:25.220
But I don't feel as bad
as I thought I was going to.

54:25.304 --> 54:26.388
Why do you think that is?

54:27.806 --> 54:29.847
I'm getting to know
some of the people in the house.

54:30.934 --> 54:33.187
Some of them actually seem
like they're doing okay.

54:33.270 --> 54:36.940
- I hope so.
- No, I mean, really okay.

54:38.567 --> 54:42.613
Like they might get lives
and be semi-interesting people.

54:42.696 --> 54:46.325
Did you just say
something vaguely optimistic?

54:46.408 --> 54:47.701
I did say "semi"...

54:49.244 --> 54:50.787
but... yeah.

54:54.958 --> 54:57.169
- So, the family...
- Can I be honest?

54:57.252 --> 55:01.131
I've talked about my dad,
all that family stuff.

55:02.341 --> 55:04.551
I have issues. Whatever.

55:05.552 --> 55:08.055
Talk is not helping.

55:08.138 --> 55:09.681
I think you're right.

55:10.724 --> 55:14.144
- Really?
- Generally, I just need a few facts.

55:14.228 --> 55:16.021
And we're never doing
family therapy again.

55:16.104 --> 55:20.817
It doesn't seem to be useful here.
That was a shit-show.

55:21.860 --> 55:24.821
- Yeah, that's what my sister said.
- I liked her.

55:24.905 --> 55:28.492
- Yeah, me too. We get along great.
- I could tell.

55:28.575 --> 55:32.496
She was the only one who had something
to say that wasn't entirely self-serving.

55:32.579 --> 55:33.580
Yeah.

55:36.500 --> 55:39.545
- Now, I'm gonna be honest with you.
- Uh-oh.

55:41.171 --> 55:44.258
- I'm not crazy about your name.
- What?

55:44.341 --> 55:47.219
"Ellen" doesn't suit you.
It's too old-fashioned.

55:48.428 --> 55:51.098
- I've never really liked it.
- So, change it.

55:51.181 --> 55:52.849
I can't just change it.

55:54.893 --> 55:55.936
I can't, right?

55:56.019 --> 55:58.647
Just tell people to call you
by a different name.

55:58.730 --> 56:01.191
Or, if you wanna make it legal,
you can fill out a form online

56:01.275 --> 56:02.609
in about ten minutes.

56:04.236 --> 56:05.654
I was thinking "Ellie."

56:06.697 --> 56:10.367
- Ooh...
- That's no good. No.

56:10.450 --> 56:12.077
How about...

56:13.287 --> 56:14.496
"Eli"?

56:23.422 --> 56:24.464
Call me "Eli."

56:28.427 --> 56:31.179
- You get your iPad?
- Oh, yeah.

56:31.263 --> 56:33.849
The world opens up
beyond your wildest dreams

56:33.932 --> 56:35.309
when you put on some LBs.

56:36.351 --> 56:38.103
- Eli?
- Yeah.

56:38.186 --> 56:40.397
Don't tell me you're gay now, too.

56:40.480 --> 56:44.359
The male population cannot take
another quality defection.

56:44.443 --> 56:47.571
- Most definitely not gay.
- Thank God.

56:47.654 --> 56:53.577
No, "Eli" is a... new name for me.

56:53.660 --> 56:55.912
Ellen... Eli...

56:55.996 --> 57:00.334
Hm, I like it. It's very... George Sand.

57:03.962 --> 57:06.757
You're dazzling. You know that, Eli?

57:08.383 --> 57:14.222
So, I'm officially inviting Eli
to my dinner out tomorrow night.

57:14.306 --> 57:16.725
As part of my reward,
I can take anyone I want.

57:16.808 --> 57:19.061
Um, I'm not really restaurant ready,
but thanks.

57:19.144 --> 57:23.982
It can be your pick. It doesn't even have
to be on Mr. Gold's essential 100.

57:24.066 --> 57:26.193
No, you should take someone
who bites and chews...

57:26.276 --> 57:28.487
We can walk there.

57:28.570 --> 57:34.409
All the way to Hollywood or wherever,
and you don't have to eat.

57:37.496 --> 57:38.538
Can I run?

57:40.165 --> 57:45.921
- I don't run, psycho. My knee, remember?
- Well, can you walk fast?

57:46.004 --> 57:48.465
I read that it doesn't matter
how fast you walk.

57:48.548 --> 57:50.801
It's distance.
You burn the same amount of calories.

57:50.884 --> 57:53.679
- That's bullshit.
- Will you just slow down a little?

57:53.762 --> 57:55.514
I'm not even going that fast.

57:55.597 --> 57:56.765
Um...

57:56.848 --> 58:00.310
I will have the number 12
with the rice and the egg roll.

58:00.394 --> 58:02.187
Mm-hmm.

58:02.270 --> 58:03.814
Can I have the Tom Tum Kai soup?

58:03.897 --> 58:05.941
- It comes with your entrée.
- Oh, that's all...

58:06.024 --> 58:08.402
She'll have the number 12, too,
with the egg roll.

58:08.485 --> 58:09.403
No.

58:09.486 --> 58:10.862
- Yes.
- No.

58:10.946 --> 58:13.991
She'll have the number 12, too,
with the egg roll.

58:15.367 --> 58:17.744
- And to drink?
- We'll have two Tsingtao.

58:18.996 --> 58:19.996
Your ID?

58:24.543 --> 58:30.257
I... I don't wanna put you
on the spot or anything, um...

58:30.340 --> 58:31.591
but we're from the hospice.

58:34.094 --> 58:35.137
For cancer.

58:38.181 --> 58:40.058
Um...

58:40.142 --> 58:43.854
- I'm sorry. I can't serve you without ID.
- It's just, um...

58:44.855 --> 58:46.273
This is our first date.

58:48.358 --> 58:51.528
It's maybe our only date. I just...

58:52.779 --> 58:55.198
I don't know. I wanted it to be special.

59:04.374 --> 59:06.376
Thank you very much.

59:11.298 --> 59:14.801
We can pick a different disease
for different restaurants.

59:14.885 --> 59:16.678
You're so sick.

59:16.762 --> 59:18.346
- We both are, actually.
- Yeah.

59:22.392 --> 59:25.645
I put it in there
so nobody would ask questions.

59:25.729 --> 59:29.316
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

59:32.402 --> 59:33.820
<i>♪ Oh... ♪</i>

59:33.904 --> 59:36.031
- You are so...
<i>- ♪ Oh... ♪</i>

59:37.240 --> 59:39.326
- Are you...?
<i>- ♪ Oh... ♪</i>

59:41.995 --> 59:44.247
You are so wrong.

59:50.545 --> 59:52.047
- Hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

59:52.130 --> 59:54.966
- Bite.
- I don't like egg rolls.

59:55.050 --> 59:56.510
Who doesn't like egg rolls?

59:56.593 --> 59:59.679
Chew and spit if you wanna be lame,
but you look thinner.

59:59.763 --> 01:00:01.431
If I taste it, will you leave me alone?

01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:04.476
If you taste everything,
I will leave you alone.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:09.815
Oh, yeah. So good.

01:00:09.898 --> 01:00:11.233
- Yeah.
- Mm.

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:15.612
- Mm!
- Right? It's good, right?

01:00:15.695 --> 01:00:17.823
Uh-huh. Mm.

01:00:17.906 --> 01:00:19.950
- Swallow that egg roll.
- Blegh!

01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:21.159
Oh...

01:00:23.328 --> 01:00:24.328
Oh!

01:00:25.914 --> 01:00:30.210
Jesus Christ.
That was a thing of great beauty.

01:00:31.336 --> 01:00:34.005
- That's super hot.
- I know. It's what I was going for.

01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:38.969
So, I find out I can pull
the patient ID thing all the way up my arm

01:00:39.052 --> 01:00:40.595
and hide it underneath my T-shirt,

01:00:40.679 --> 01:00:45.225
and I just get out past
the nurse's station, I just walk out.

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:48.145
- Where were you even going?
- The beach?

01:00:49.938 --> 01:00:51.731
I don't even know.

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:54.651
But there I am,
just jogging down Wilshire Boulevard.

01:00:55.861 --> 01:00:57.988
I'm a full-on crazy person,

01:00:58.071 --> 01:01:02.367
and I'm jogging at the light...
when my mom drives up.

01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:05.871
- She was on the way to the hospital.
- Oh, my God.

01:01:05.954 --> 01:01:06.955
You don't like it?

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:13.128
No, I do. It's just, um...

01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:17.215
She... She just gets a bit nauseous
because of, um...

01:01:18.633 --> 01:01:20.385
the chemo.

01:01:20.468 --> 01:01:24.181
But it tastes really good.
The beer really helps.

01:01:25.557 --> 01:01:29.436
- I'll get you another one, no charge.
- Thank you very much.

01:01:31.813 --> 01:01:34.274
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:36.985
- No charge.
- Oh, my God, we're going to hell.

01:01:37.068 --> 01:01:38.862
Yeah.

01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:46.578
- Did he try to kiss you?
- Ew! Does he even like girls?

01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:47.996
No.

01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:51.875
I don't know.

01:01:59.424 --> 01:02:01.468
What I'm trying to say is,

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:04.679
why does she get to leave the house
when she's only level two?

01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:07.766
- It was Luke's night out.
- Yeah, but Ellen got to go.

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:08.975
It's "Eli" now.

01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:14.144
It might make you feel better to know
that Dr. Beck scheduled a special trip

01:02:14.189 --> 01:02:15.941
for you guys in a couple of days.

01:02:16.024 --> 01:02:18.735
- Tell me it's not the Holocaust Museum.
- No.

01:02:18.818 --> 01:02:22.697
My mother took me there to make me
feel shitty, you know, about starving.

01:02:26.493 --> 01:02:27.827
It's okay. We're Jewish.

01:02:35.043 --> 01:02:38.296
Damn, Dr. Beck.
Are you trying to turn me straight?

01:02:39.673 --> 01:02:41.258
That's a different program.

01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:43.426
- Hi, everyone.
- Hey!

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:47.305
Okay, so this place we're going, I had
to pull some strings to get us in there,

01:02:47.389 --> 01:02:48.848
so you have to behave.

01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:50.517
Tell us. I can't stand it.

01:02:51.643 --> 01:02:52.811
Tell us!

01:02:52.894 --> 01:02:54.813
Tell us! Tell us!

01:02:54.896 --> 01:02:57.148
Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!

01:03:00.819 --> 01:03:02.112
I don't like this.

01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:05.657
I'm definitely getting a Holocaust vibe,
doc.

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:09.286
- It's okay, I promise.
- I don't believe you.

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:24.801
What is it?

01:03:27.554 --> 01:03:28.596
Art.

01:03:36.062 --> 01:03:38.565
Somebody tell me why we're here!

01:03:44.863 --> 01:03:46.114
Because we're alive.

01:03:47.699 --> 01:03:49.743
Very good.

Here you go.

01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:53.199
You're shaking like a chihuahua.

01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:16.890
I know what you're trying to do.

01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:22.979
Life's beautiful and all that... shit.

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:26.983
And that upsets you because...?

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.029
Because it is.

01:06:34.365 --> 01:06:40.914
I mean, I... I know it can be,
but I... I can't stop.

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:48.546
And I don't even know why.
I just... I just can't.

01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:54.177
Yeah, that's bullshit.
That voice that says you can't.

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:57.347
Every time you hear that voice,
I want you to tell it to fuck off.

01:06:58.723 --> 01:07:03.353
- Fuck off, voice!
- Yeah! Fuck off!

01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:05.772
- Fuck you, voice!
- Fuck you, voice!

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:07.607
- Fuck you, voice!
- Fuck off!

01:07:08.733 --> 01:07:10.360
Fuck!

01:07:10.443 --> 01:07:13.321
Yeah! Whoo!

01:07:13.404 --> 01:07:14.739
Yeah! Yeah!

01:07:14.822 --> 01:07:16.199
Fuck off.

01:07:27.252 --> 01:07:30.004
- That's what they always say.
- I know.

01:07:30.088 --> 01:07:32.215
- What are you... ooh!
- I'll go blueberry.

01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:33.424
I didn't say...

01:08:11.546 --> 01:08:13.548
Try not to look too pleased
with yourself.

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:25.602
Mm-hmm.

01:08:25.685 --> 01:08:27.353
"Cassidy." That's her name.

01:08:30.356 --> 01:08:32.149
Um...

01:08:32.233 --> 01:08:37.154
It's a girl, and today
she is 12 weeks and one day old.

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:39.948
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

01:08:43.036 --> 01:08:45.705
Can we have the baby shower now?

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:50.417
Yes, but I...
Just don't be a spaz about it, okay?

01:08:50.501 --> 01:08:52.211
- Okay. Sorry.
- Don't go...

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:54.296
She's gonna have ponies everywhere.

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:55.548
Ta-da!

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.634
Oh, yeah.

01:08:57.716 --> 01:08:58.760
Amazing.

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:05.475
I mean, that's one sassy unicorn.

01:09:06.517 --> 01:09:08.060
I can't believe you drew that for her.

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:11.981
- You're welcome.
- It's awesome.

01:09:13.358 --> 01:09:16.361
Um, I love you guys and thank you.

01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:17.819
Cheers.

01:09:38.424 --> 01:09:39.424
Whee!

01:09:40.801 --> 01:09:42.511
- It's so crazy.
- It's so high.

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:44.389
- I'm actually quite terrified.
- Oh, my God.

01:09:44.471 --> 01:09:46.224
- Fifty feet up.
- Here we go.

01:09:46.307 --> 01:09:49.268
Whoa. Whoa!

01:09:49.352 --> 01:09:53.272
- All right, now it's your turn.
- No, I'd better not.

01:09:53.356 --> 01:09:56.109
- Fucking knee.
- That knee.

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:00.238
Yup.

01:10:15.002 --> 01:10:16.003
Sorry.

01:10:19.006 --> 01:10:21.217
Did somebody bad touch you
as a kid or something?

01:10:22.677 --> 01:10:25.221
- It's a big rexie thing.
- No.

01:10:26.973 --> 01:10:28.641
Not really.

01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:31.894
Hmm. Let's talk about that "really."

01:10:35.648 --> 01:10:36.899
Just normal shit.

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:42.488
The second you get boobs,
it's like open season.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:48.119
You guys are pretty disgusting that way.

01:10:48.202 --> 01:10:50.788
We could at least
have some manners about it.

01:10:50.872 --> 01:10:53.583
Not rub up against you guys
on the bus.

01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:55.251
Oh, bus rubbing.

01:10:56.627 --> 01:11:02.425
Titty grabbing... gross dirty talk...
night stalking...

01:11:02.508 --> 01:11:06.137
You're all basically just a bunch
of portable holes for men to fuck.

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:09.140
Hmm.

01:11:09.223 --> 01:11:11.726
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

01:11:11.809 --> 01:11:14.979
So... have you... done it?

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:19.275
Or... was it just too appalling?

01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:24.781
Entirely too appalling.

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.534
Ever had an orgasm?

01:11:30.161 --> 01:11:32.330
- Um... God!
- Sorry.

01:11:32.413 --> 01:11:35.249
- You don't have to answer that.
- Personal.

01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:39.837
It's different for guys, you know.
It's... It's very different.

01:11:39.921 --> 01:11:42.882
There it is... bobbing at you.

01:11:44.217 --> 01:11:48.346
Just bobbing,
begging to be manhandled.

01:11:50.014 --> 01:11:52.225
That's... That's way too much information.

01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:55.561
Not right now, but it could be.

01:11:57.063 --> 01:11:58.439
I just...

01:11:58.523 --> 01:12:00.191
- Okay.
- I...

01:12:01.609 --> 01:12:04.737
I need to do my research. And you...

01:12:07.198 --> 01:12:11.828
need to be touched by someone
who actually cares about you.

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:15.163
Luke...

01:12:39.897 --> 01:12:41.357
I'm falling in love with you.

01:12:43.442 --> 01:12:47.530
- God! Luke, really? I...
- I'm sorry.

01:12:47.613 --> 01:12:50.950
- No, sorry, it's just...
- No, you're right.

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:53.786
It'll be like slapping
two bags of bones together anyway.

01:12:55.288 --> 01:12:58.541
- We should go back inside.
- Hey! What the fuck?

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:01.752
What the fuck what?

01:13:01.836 --> 01:13:04.547
Suddenly, you decide
this is a physical thing,

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:06.632
and I'm caught by surprise,

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:09.927
and now you're just gonna go pout
and make this my fault?

01:13:10.011 --> 01:13:12.722
All right, I'm sorry.
Obviously, it was a bad idea.

01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:16.809
I just thought, if you knew
I wanted it to be good or different...

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:18.895
And you're falling in love with me?

01:13:18.978 --> 01:13:22.565
Okay, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to unleash the Kraken.

01:13:22.648 --> 01:13:26.819
- I've known you for, like, three weeks.
- Well, I've known you for two years.

01:13:26.903 --> 01:13:29.363
Your drawing,
the way you see things...

01:13:29.447 --> 01:13:32.658
Yeah? Oh, okay.

01:13:32.742 --> 01:13:38.664
This rexie girl, who saw my stuff
on Tumblr, liked the way I saw... so much,

01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:43.044
that when she slit her wrists,
she left me the fucking note.

01:13:44.795 --> 01:13:46.422
And you know what her parents did?

01:13:47.882 --> 01:13:52.511
They sent me pictures...
so I'd really know what I'd done.

01:13:57.016 --> 01:13:58.768
People say they love you...

01:14:00.144 --> 01:14:01.187
but what they mean is,

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:05.900
they love how loving you
makes them feel about themselves.

01:14:05.983 --> 01:14:11.072
Or... Or they love
what they can take from you.

01:14:11.155 --> 01:14:14.867
I don't even know where to start
with that. That's all kinds of wrong.

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:17.495
I'm done.

01:14:18.496 --> 01:14:23.125
Okay, all right, you win!
All right? You're the queen of darkness.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:25.878
Hey, come on!

01:14:58.202 --> 01:15:00.538
- Megan!
- Megan?

01:15:00.621 --> 01:15:03.082
Megan! Megan, it's Luke! Let me in!

01:15:17.388 --> 01:15:20.391
I thought I was safe.

01:15:21.726 --> 01:15:23.602
I know, I know.

01:15:25.730 --> 01:15:27.481
It's gonna be okay.

01:15:29.984 --> 01:15:31.235
I know. I'm sorry.

01:15:32.778 --> 01:15:34.989
Guys, go back to bed.

01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:55.384
Can you push a baby out
by throwing up too hard?

01:15:57.011 --> 01:16:01.807
Yeah, that's exactly how it happens.
Don't be an idiot.

01:16:05.352 --> 01:16:06.937
Good morning.

01:16:07.021 --> 01:16:08.314
- Good morning.
- Hi.

01:16:10.691 --> 01:16:11.984
How's Megan?

01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:17.490
She's at the hospital.
She's fine now, physically.

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:22.411
She's not sure she wants
to come back here...

01:16:23.871 --> 01:16:25.081
which I understand.

01:16:26.457 --> 01:16:27.666
Can we visit her?

01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:33.005
Not yet, but I think, in a few days,
that's exactly what she needs.

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:34.089
I wanna go home.

01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:37.134
I bet you do.

01:16:39.136 --> 01:16:45.017
Listen. Bad things are going to happen.
That's not negotiable.

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:48.854
What is, is how you deal with it.

01:16:56.112 --> 01:16:57.113
Would you read this?

01:16:58.531 --> 01:17:00.366
- Do I have to?
- No.

01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:03.202
Okay.

01:17:13.587 --> 01:17:16.048
'"Courage' by Anne Sexton.

It is in the small things that we see it.

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:27.059
The child's first step,
as awesome as an earthquake.

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:31.272
<i>The first time you rode a bike,
wallowing up the sidewalk.</i>

01:17:31.355 --> 01:17:35.860
<i>The first spanking, when your heart
went on a journey all alone.</i>

01:17:35.943 --> 01:17:40.906
<i>When they called you 'crybaby'
or 'poor' or 'fatty' or 'crazy'...</i>

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:43.242
and made you into an alien...

01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:45.744
you drank their acid
and you concealed it."

01:17:50.457 --> 01:17:55.421
"Later, if you faced
the death of bombs and bullets...

01:17:56.422 --> 01:17:58.716
you did not do it with a banner.

01:17:58.799 --> 01:18:01.802
You did it with only a hat
to cover your heart.

01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:06.599
<i>You did not fondle the weakness inside you
though it was there.</i>

01:18:09.727 --> 01:18:12.980
<i>Your courage was a small coal
that you kept swallowing."</i>

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:24.325
So, Megan did decide to go home.

01:18:29.914 --> 01:18:31.665
Anybody wanna talk about that?

01:18:35.586 --> 01:18:38.547
It's her fault. She was purging.

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:45.471
I think Megan wanted her baby.
I really think she did.

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:49.725
- We shouldn't have had the shower.
- No, I don't think it was that.

01:18:53.771 --> 01:18:55.147
Eli, you and Luke found her.

01:18:57.733 --> 01:18:58.984
That must have been hard.

01:19:02.154 --> 01:19:03.989
That baby was never gonna make it.

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:11.413
- Where is Luke, anyway?
- He's at the doctor for his knee.

01:19:15.668 --> 01:19:16.669
Eli?

01:19:19.505 --> 01:19:20.631
Eli.

01:19:22.967 --> 01:19:24.426
What's going on with you?

01:19:25.678 --> 01:19:26.762
Nothing.

01:19:27.972 --> 01:19:31.183
Lobo tells me you're about a day away
from getting the tube.

01:19:32.643 --> 01:19:33.811
You've been making progress,

01:19:33.894 --> 01:19:36.855
but you can't stay at Threshold
if you drop any more weight.

01:19:40.025 --> 01:19:43.195
I just think it's so weird
that you know everything about me...

01:19:44.488 --> 01:19:46.198
and I don't know anything about you.

01:19:48.117 --> 01:19:51.120
Okay, what do you wanna know?

01:19:52.538 --> 01:19:54.415
- Do you have a wife?
- No.

01:19:55.541 --> 01:19:58.961
- Do you have kids?
- No.

01:19:59.044 --> 01:20:01.547
So, what's your damage?

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:03.882
Short version, my work.

01:20:05.092 --> 01:20:09.930
It takes up all my time,
and I... I like it that way.

01:20:11.765 --> 01:20:14.601
Women generally wanna spend time
with somebody they date.

01:20:15.686 --> 01:20:18.105
Sounds like
you're avoiding intimacy, doctor.

01:20:21.358 --> 01:20:23.277
Yeah, I guess it does.

01:20:26.697 --> 01:20:30.492
Lobo also tells me
that you and Luke aren't speaking.

01:20:30.576 --> 01:20:32.995
It seemed like you and Luke
had something good going.

01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:35.706
Whatever. He's totally gay.

01:20:35.789 --> 01:20:39.335
That would be easier, right?
Then you could write him off.

01:20:41.045 --> 01:20:44.089
- Does he talk to you about me?
- You know I can't answer that.

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:55.893
- I just don't see the point.
- In what?

01:21:04.109 --> 01:21:05.611
There is no point.

01:21:07.071 --> 01:21:10.407
Or at least, big picture,
we don't get to know what it is.

01:21:10.491 --> 01:21:15.037
Why we live, why Megan lost the baby,
why that girl killed herself.

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:18.499
- You're not reassuring me, doctor.
- I can't reassure you.

01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:22.920
This idea you have
that there's a way to be safe...

01:21:23.003 --> 01:21:24.880
it's childish and cowardly.

01:21:26.006 --> 01:21:29.802
It stops you from experiencing anything,
including anything good.

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:31.845
You don't think I feel bad enough already?

01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:34.723
I know I'm messed up...

01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:39.561
but you're supposed to teach me
how not to be.

01:21:39.645 --> 01:21:41.814
You know how.

01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:46.819
Stop waiting for life to be easy.
Stop hoping for somebody to save you.

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:49.863
You don't need
another person lying to you.

01:21:49.947 --> 01:21:51.949
Things don't all add up.

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:55.786
But you're resilient.

01:21:55.869 --> 01:22:00.124
Face some hard facts
and you could have an incredible life.

01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:04.336
That's your pearl of wisdom?

01:22:06.547 --> 01:22:08.048
Grow a pair?

01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:13.679
That's a more concise way
of putting it. Yeah.

01:22:17.057 --> 01:22:18.183
Unbelievable.

01:22:19.893 --> 01:22:21.395
Fuck you.

01:22:25.858 --> 01:22:29.445
- What's going on?
- Beck's messed up, you know that?

01:22:29.528 --> 01:22:33.115
We all buy the hype,
but nobody here is getting any better.

01:22:33.198 --> 01:22:36.910
- That's not true.
- Yeah? Megan's screwed.

01:22:36.994 --> 01:22:39.663
Anna has a treasure chest of puke
under her bed.

01:22:39.746 --> 01:22:42.166
You live in fucking Ponyland.

01:22:42.249 --> 01:22:45.377
I'm about to get the tube,
and he doesn't even care.

01:22:49.923 --> 01:22:50.966
Shit.

01:22:52.176 --> 01:22:58.557
I need another surgery. That's it for me
and the illustrious Jersey Ballet.

01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.850
Seriously?

01:23:02.019 --> 01:23:06.190
Yeah. Come on, put your bag down.
Let's go get another cancer beer.

01:23:06.273 --> 01:23:08.692
I can't. Sorry. I'm actually out of here.

01:23:08.775 --> 01:23:10.152
Did you hear what I said?

01:23:11.695 --> 01:23:15.157
I'm finished. And you're leaving?

01:23:18.035 --> 01:23:19.995
I can't.

01:23:20.078 --> 01:23:23.040
What, you think I didn't guess
my knee was fucked?

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:27.669
And now that I'm done
doing the one thing that makes me feel,

01:23:27.753 --> 01:23:29.004
you're my next thing.

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:38.388
I know that that's not a plan.
It's not a good one, anyway.

01:23:40.432 --> 01:23:43.560
But I need you... Eli.

01:23:59.785 --> 01:24:01.954
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

01:24:03.372 --> 01:24:04.456
- Thank you.
- Sure.

01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:24.309
<i>There is no point.</i>

01:24:25.602 --> 01:24:27.312
<i>That girl killed herself.</i>

01:24:29.356 --> 01:24:30.899
<i>You look like a ghost.</i>

01:24:33.235 --> 01:24:34.444
<i>If you die...</i>

01:24:36.196 --> 01:24:38.073
<i>I will kill you.</i>

01:24:38.156 --> 01:24:39.199
<i>You okay, honey?</i>

01:24:40.617 --> 01:24:44.288
I... I just got up too fast. Sorry.

01:24:45.831 --> 01:24:47.207
You need to eat, girl.

01:24:47.291 --> 01:24:52.504
I'm fine. But thank you.
I just need to get home.

01:25:38.467 --> 01:25:39.801
What kind of place is this,

01:25:39.885 --> 01:25:42.721
where your patients can just walk off
like that and nobody stops her?

01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:45.932
The problem with treatment
for some of these kids...

01:25:46.016 --> 01:25:48.143
is that we won't let them hit bottom.

01:25:48.226 --> 01:25:52.773
It's too hard to watch.
But for Eli, the bottom is critical.

01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:11.291
How is there even less of you?
What did that doctor do to you?

01:26:11.375 --> 01:26:12.376
Hi, Mom.

01:26:13.377 --> 01:26:15.837
- Is this all you've got?
- Yeah.

01:26:15.921 --> 01:26:18.715
All right.
Well, everybody's waiting for you.

01:26:18.799 --> 01:26:22.344
- "Everybody"?
- Horses. They're very sweet beasts.

01:26:26.306 --> 01:26:29.184
Olive and I were worried that it wasn't
gonna work out with that doctor.

01:26:29.267 --> 01:26:31.812
- Well, he had such an attitude.
- Oh, God complex.

01:26:31.895 --> 01:26:33.855
- Totally dismissive.
- And Susan...

01:26:33.939 --> 01:26:38.193
- I mean, he really let her attack us.
- He just wanted everybody to be honest.

01:26:38.276 --> 01:26:39.587
I don't like to speak negatively,

01:26:39.611 --> 01:26:42.114
but that woman's never said an honest word
in her life.

01:26:42.197 --> 01:26:44.258
Of course, your father doesn't go home.
Can you imagine?

01:26:44.282 --> 01:26:46.618
She fought really hard to get me
into Threshold House.

01:26:46.702 --> 01:26:48.245
Yeah, look how well that turned out.

01:26:49.329 --> 01:26:52.749
And how about the way she talked
about your mother's breakdowns?

01:26:52.833 --> 01:26:56.753
They were transformational for me.
Everybody should have more breakdowns.

01:26:59.506 --> 01:27:01.666
You didn't feel that way about them
when they happened.

01:27:08.014 --> 01:27:11.810
Dr. Beckham called here earlier.
He thought you might turn up.

01:27:11.893 --> 01:27:15.564
- He did? What did you say?
- Well, that you'd decided to leave.

01:27:15.647 --> 01:27:18.567
He wanted to make sure you were okay.

01:27:18.650 --> 01:27:21.945
A boy wanted to speak with you. Luke?

01:27:25.323 --> 01:27:29.035
Is this somebody special?

01:27:29.119 --> 01:27:30.495
I don't know. He...

01:27:31.496 --> 01:27:34.624
He's my friend, kind of...

01:27:36.042 --> 01:27:37.669
It all got fucked up.

01:27:45.927 --> 01:27:49.097
In the morning,
Olive would like you to work with Freya.

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:52.642
The horse?

01:27:53.685 --> 01:27:56.605
Olive has grown tremendously out here.
You'll thank me.

01:27:56.688 --> 01:28:00.525
But isn't that kind of like a conflict?
Her giving me therapy?

01:28:00.609 --> 01:28:05.447
Freya does all the work.
I'm just a conduit.

01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:07.699
- Oh.
- Yeah, she's just a conduit.

01:28:08.742 --> 01:28:13.789
There's no electricity, but I think...
It's not so cold. You'll be okay.

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:18.585
- You're gonna sleep, anyway.
- Yeah, I'm tired.

01:28:18.668 --> 01:28:22.964
There's a bedpan here.
So, if you need it...

01:28:23.048 --> 01:28:25.467
It's better than stumbling around
in the dark.

01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:26.593
Okay.

01:28:27.677 --> 01:28:32.057
- People pay money to stay here?
- It's rustic. They love it.

01:28:45.946 --> 01:28:48.198
- Ellen...
- "Eli."

01:28:48.281 --> 01:28:51.618
You know, "Ellen" was
your great-grandmother's name.

01:28:51.701 --> 01:28:53.328
I bet she didn't like it either.

01:28:56.832 --> 01:29:02.128
You know, I... had a premonition
before you came.

01:29:02.212 --> 01:29:05.924
- Really?
- You were a baby.

01:29:06.007 --> 01:29:09.094
I didn't hold you enough.
I didn't bond with you.

01:29:10.554 --> 01:29:14.349
And, of course, that's true.
I didn't know about postpartum depression.

01:29:15.684 --> 01:29:19.104
- I don't think that's it.
- Well, anyway...

01:29:22.691 --> 01:29:26.486
I spoke to Jean Williamson about it.
Do you remember her?

01:29:26.570 --> 01:29:30.824
- The pastor?
- No, she wrote <i>The Pure Way of Light.</i>

01:29:30.907 --> 01:29:33.326
She's very interested in Olive's work

01:29:33.410 --> 01:29:38.957
and has been... a great comfort to me
around your illness.

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:40.041
And she...

01:29:41.751 --> 01:29:46.506
feels that it would be healing
for the both of us

01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:50.510
if you allowed me to feed you.

01:30:00.979 --> 01:30:05.442
- It's rice milk. I made it myself.
- Like a baby?

01:30:06.610 --> 01:30:09.237
Well, like a mother and a child.

01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:15.660
I could hold you and rock you,
and you could go to sleep.

01:30:17.454 --> 01:30:18.622
Uh, I don't know.

01:30:20.081 --> 01:30:24.169
No, I know. I know it's odd.

01:30:25.879 --> 01:30:26.879
But...

01:30:27.714 --> 01:30:31.926
Well, as she said it, I felt real clarity
that that's what we need.

01:30:34.304 --> 01:30:35.430
Can I think about it?

01:30:38.308 --> 01:30:39.893
Yeah, okay.

01:30:47.233 --> 01:30:48.233
There's, uh...

01:30:49.986 --> 01:30:54.115
not much left of you to lose.
You know that?

01:30:55.283 --> 01:30:58.119
- Dr. Beckham made that clear.
- I know.

01:30:59.996 --> 01:31:01.539
Hmm.

01:31:01.623 --> 01:31:05.085
He said it's your choice,
whether you come back or not.

01:31:06.670 --> 01:31:10.674
But I could tell that he was afraid
that you're gonna die.

01:31:12.842 --> 01:31:16.763
Ellen, my... my baby.

01:31:16.846 --> 01:31:18.306
I...

01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:19.516
I know.

01:31:20.809 --> 01:31:22.394
I'm sorry.

01:31:24.688 --> 01:31:25.730
And...

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:29.317
I just want you to know that...

01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:32.654
I accept it if...

01:31:34.114 --> 01:31:36.741
If death is what you want,
I accept it now.

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:42.747
I accept it, but um... I love you.

01:31:44.749 --> 01:31:46.751
I just... I can't keep fighting you.

01:31:49.045 --> 01:31:50.088
All right.

01:31:51.756 --> 01:31:52.799
Okay.

01:31:54.634 --> 01:31:55.634
Mom?

01:31:57.053 --> 01:31:58.053
Yeah?

01:32:02.475 --> 01:32:03.852
Feed me, please.

01:32:05.895 --> 01:32:06.980
Yeah.

01:32:09.899 --> 01:32:10.942
Yeah.

01:32:12.736 --> 01:32:13.778
Okay.

01:32:17.699 --> 01:32:18.742
Okay.

01:32:24.831 --> 01:32:27.834
Can you hold this? Hold on.

01:32:29.919 --> 01:32:33.548
Okay. Do you mind if I put your feet down?

01:32:34.799 --> 01:32:37.761
Okay. Are you comfortable?

01:32:37.844 --> 01:32:40.597
Okay.

01:32:44.934 --> 01:32:46.811
- Yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.
