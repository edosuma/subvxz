01:21.915 --> 01:25.915
<i>I wrote this story for Renee because</i>

01:28.129 --> 01:29.879
<i>I wanted to believe in the happily ever after.</i>

01:31.883 --> 01:33.223
<i>Now, her story isn't unique,</i>

01:34.552 --> 01:36.352
<i>but she is.</i>

01:38.556 --> 01:42.016
<i>The way she speaks the truth.</i>

01:42.727 --> 01:44.227
<i>The way she sees the world.</i>

01:52.445 --> 01:55.905
<i>Once upon a time there was a girl
who loved fairy tales.</i>

01:57.492 --> 02:00.582
<i>Her mind painted the brightest day.</i>

02:02.080 --> 02:05.580
<i>And the darkest night.</i>

02:15.385 --> 02:18.215
<i>But her imagination turned on her</i>

02:18.263 --> 02:22.683
<i>and found her wherever she would hide.</i>

02:38.783 --> 02:40.663
It's okay, it's okay now.

02:40.744 --> 02:42.584
There, there, sweetheart.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.920
Good night.

02:46.708 --> 02:50.048
Now, where are we going to go
in our dreams tonight?

02:50.128 --> 02:51.548
My garden.

02:51.588 --> 02:55.718
Good, good.
Now you draw your beautiful garden.

03:28.583 --> 03:33.383
<i>So she imagined the most beautiful garden.</i>

03:37.926 --> 03:43.006
<i>But even the sun
could not outshine the gray.</i>

03:47.102 --> 03:49.852
<i>When her best friend, Jessie, lost her mom,</i>

03:51.147 --> 03:55.987
<i>she realized not every story has
a happy ending.</i>

03:58.154 --> 04:02.624
<i>So the girl grew up
and left fairy tales behind,</i>

04:03.993 --> 04:07.583
<i>but her music, art and friends
made her feel something...</i>

04:07.622 --> 04:11.382
<i>...even if it wasn't happily ever after.</i>

04:13.878 --> 04:16.168
-Yep?
-Hello?

04:16.589 --> 04:18.798
You left this on the counter last night.

04:19.216 --> 04:20.427
Crazy pills.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.800
No, no, bipolar is not crazy.

04:22.887 --> 04:25.137
What were you doing when the memory part
of my brain was forming?

04:25.223 --> 04:26.433
-I forget.
-You what?

04:26.516 --> 04:28.386
-Take them.
-Okay.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.253
Only in Orlando.

04:59.466 --> 05:02.716
Monday play list. Track four.

05:04.804 --> 05:07.644
One, two, three...

05:44.344 --> 05:46.894
-What?
-Sean sighting.

05:49.391 --> 05:50.681
You ladies coming tonight?

05:51.893 --> 05:53.233
I'm not a lady.

05:54.270 --> 05:56.060
-Thanks.
-See you there.

05:58.692 --> 05:59.902
He smells like leather.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.900
He smells so good.

06:02.904 --> 06:05.704
-No. It starts at midnight?
-So?

06:06.282 --> 06:07.992
-We can be there for 10 minutes.
-It's Halloween.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.946
-Are you kidding me?
-Who cares? My dad will kill me, Renee.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.036
-You know that.
-He will not.

06:11.079 --> 06:14.579
It says dancing on here.
Is it, you know, like sexy dancing?

06:14.666 --> 06:17.496
Or, you know, girls getting really close and...

06:17.544 --> 06:19.554
We're going.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.392
I don't want to get shanked
in strobe light hell,

06:34.436 --> 06:36.516
so can we, you know, please get out of here?

06:36.563 --> 06:38.613
-Yeah, let's bounce.
-Let's explore a little bit.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.150
-No.
-Let's explore.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.533
There's nothing over there.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.360
-Renee!
-Jessie!

08:01.398 --> 08:02.608
We need to go home.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.112
No. Where'd she go?

08:05.193 --> 08:06.363
Where did... Are you drunk now?

08:06.403 --> 08:08.703
-It was so beautiful.
-Hey, hey, come on.

08:08.738 --> 08:11.118
You know what, this place sucks
and you're trashed and I wanna go home.

08:11.199 --> 08:12.659
No, no, no. I like how this place is.

08:12.742 --> 08:15.332
-No, well, I don't care, we're going home.
-You're not my mom, Jess!

08:18.331 --> 08:21.001
-Walk your ass home then.
-Why don't you just...

08:21.543 --> 08:24.883
Nice one. Way to go.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.383
Don't leave like that.

08:27.424 --> 08:28.884
Don't worry, I got you.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.138
That was bad.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.717
I'll take you home.

11:50.502 --> 11:52.252
I think these swings are broken.

11:52.337 --> 11:55.297
-Need me to push you?
-I think I do.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.850
You're Superman!

12:02.889 --> 12:06.269
Michael, come on. Dinner time.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.939
-You wanna get higher?
-Shit, Mackey!

12:16.027 --> 12:18.237
And, yes, I do have the shit.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.411
Come on.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.575
Got it? There you go.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.877
Unbelievable.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.004
Damn kids.

12:34.045 --> 12:36.165
You know what I thought about
the first time I got high?

12:36.214 --> 12:37.224
What?

12:37.298 --> 12:39.378
That Adam and Eve must have been cavemen.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.506
What?

12:40.635 --> 12:44.555
Think about it, we grow up
and they tell us about Adam and Eve,

12:44.597 --> 12:48.267
and then we go to school
and they teach us about cavemen.

12:48.351 --> 12:51.731
The whole point of our education
is to get rid of those fairy tales.

12:51.813 --> 12:55.233
I think Adam and Eve is
the truest story I've ever heard.

12:55.316 --> 12:59.066
'Cause things are perfect
and then you ruin them.

13:00.405 --> 13:02.445
Man's gonna cope.

13:02.532 --> 13:06.122
Speaking of which,
word is it's snowing in Daytona.

13:06.661 --> 13:08.541
-At Echo's?
-Yes.

13:08.747 --> 13:09.867
Yes!

13:11.416 --> 13:12.956
-Ready? One, two...
-Go!

13:20.300 --> 13:22.550
Man, leave that poor fish alone.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.885
Children's stories are sick, man.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.929
You got Humpty Dumpty
chillin' on the wall, right?

13:28.016 --> 13:30.016
I wouldn't be on the wall if I was an egg.

13:30.393 --> 13:33.363
That's suicidal, man. You know, for real.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.396
Maybe he was a crackhead.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.780
He was just a dumb egg.

13:36.858 --> 13:38.438
He's not an egg.

13:39.402 --> 13:41.322
-Yeah, he was.
-No.

13:41.738 --> 13:45.578
The nursery rhyme never says he's an egg.
The artist drew him like that.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.698
Whatever, man.

13:47.744 --> 13:50.414
The shit's set. Who's in?

13:54.709 --> 13:56.379
This ain't free.

13:59.297 --> 14:03.887
<i>If you wanna hang out</i>

14:04.469 --> 14:07.219
<i>You gotta take her out</i>

14:09.849 --> 14:13.019
<i>Cocaine</i>

14:15.814 --> 14:19.154
<i>If you wanna get down</i>

14:19.234 --> 14:23.364
<i>Down on the ground
Cocaine</i>

14:25.907 --> 14:28.367
<i>If you got bad news</i>

14:28.743 --> 14:34.043
<i>Gonna kick them blues
Cocaine</i>

14:36.876 --> 14:39.746
<i>When your day is done</i>

14:39.838 --> 14:42.838
<i>And you wanna run
Cocaine</i>

14:43.425 --> 14:44.755
<i>Cocaine!</i>

14:44.843 --> 14:47.143
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

14:47.220 --> 14:50.390
<i>Don't forget this fact</i>

14:50.473 --> 14:53.893
<i>You can't get it back
Cocaine</i>

14:53.935 --> 14:56.095
<i>Cocaine!</i>

14:57.731 --> 15:01.401
<i>She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie...</i>

15:02.068 --> 15:03.278
Everybody!

15:03.361 --> 15:06.161
<i>-Cocaine!
-Cocaine!</i>

15:06.906 --> 15:08.986
-One more time, come on.
-One more time!

15:09.075 --> 15:12.445
<i>She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie</i>

15:14.330 --> 15:15.920

15:19.711 --> 15:21.051

15:42.776 --> 15:43.776
<i>Cocaine</i>

15:44.611 --> 15:45.611
No.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.447

16:09.511 --> 16:11.391
She don't lie, baby!

16:13.682 --> 16:15.682
-Yeah!
-Love cocaine!

18:34.280 --> 18:36.030
Hey, where you goin'?

18:36.533 --> 18:37.873
Leave me alone.

18:37.909 --> 18:40.499
I do believe you've got something of mine.

18:41.746 --> 18:45.416
Come on, baby, get in the... Shit.

18:46.876 --> 18:48.796
Cut her off.

19:37.218 --> 19:38.678
Hey.

19:39.220 --> 19:40.560
Hey, it's Renee.

19:42.724 --> 19:45.314
<i>I'm sorry to call so late.</i>

19:47.729 --> 19:50.569
<i>I kind of need you.</i>

20:01.910 --> 20:03.580
-Hey!
-Hi.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.460
Look at this ride.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.748
No, it's not mine. It's my boss's.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.423
-How you doin'? You look so good.
-Good.

20:10.502 --> 20:12.132
You look... You look so different.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.552
Can we go?

20:15.840 --> 20:17.590
Hi, Jess.

20:18.301 --> 20:20.051
Old friends, huh?

20:35.402 --> 20:39.572
So, I'm working
for a big music manager now.

20:40.323 --> 20:45.253
By working for him, I mean I'm just interning,
you know, for free.

20:45.870 --> 20:49.040
He still hasn't heard me sing yet.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.039
So why were you in Daytona?

20:53.545 --> 20:55.545
Thanks for getting me.

20:56.548 --> 20:58.338
So where are we taking you,
your parents' house?

20:58.383 --> 21:01.143
Or you wanna go to a crack house
or where do you wanna go?

21:01.219 --> 21:03.049
I don't know yet.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.060
It doesn't matter. Wherever it is,

21:05.223 --> 21:07.233
I have to get the car back to my manager first
and then wherever.

21:07.392 --> 21:09.522
He's your boss.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.197
You have got to be shitting me.

21:22.282 --> 21:25.082
Relax. Okay? This is where my boss is.

21:25.160 --> 21:29.080
It's just... It's kind of crazy that
there's a thing on addiction and stuff.

21:29.164 --> 21:30.874
Wow. What a coincidence.

21:30.915 --> 21:34.035
The way I see it, you kind of owe me one.
All right?

21:34.085 --> 21:36.705
So just think about going in there

21:36.796 --> 21:40.126
and listening to an ex-drug addict
who happens to be my manager.

21:40.216 --> 21:41.296
He's your boss.

21:41.509 --> 21:44.009
My boss slash future manager

21:44.054 --> 21:46.184
is in there talking about
how he used to be a crack whore,

21:46.306 --> 21:47.966
and I would say this is really good timing.

21:48.099 --> 21:51.059
He was a crack whore.
You're calling me a crack whore then?

21:51.144 --> 21:52.194
No, you're not a crack... It's the first...

21:52.228 --> 21:54.438
It's the only drug slang thing I know.
I don't...

21:54.522 --> 21:56.022
What else would I call you?

21:56.066 --> 21:57.606
I mean, I'm not calling you that.

21:57.692 --> 21:59.942
Just, whatever you do,
if you don't wanna go in there,

22:00.070 --> 22:03.530
stay here, I'll be back in 10 minutes.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.156
-Okay?
-Fine.

22:24.386 --> 22:26.136
Excuse me.

22:26.638 --> 22:30.308
Can I have a cigarette, please?
If you have an extra one?

22:31.267 --> 22:33.347
Thank you.

22:41.736 --> 22:43.106
Rough night?

22:43.446 --> 22:46.066
-Rough life.
-Cheers.

22:57.585 --> 22:59.165
So are you addicted to Jesus?

23:00.922 --> 23:03.132
Doing a favor for a friend. You?

23:03.216 --> 23:04.966
Here for the communion wine.

23:05.051 --> 23:07.141
I think it's probably watered down.

23:07.595 --> 23:08.755
I'll see you in there?

23:09.055 --> 23:11.385
-Nope.
-Okay.

23:14.102 --> 23:15.902
Here you go. Not a scratch on it.

23:15.937 --> 23:17.397
You rescue your princess?

23:18.314 --> 23:23.114
Yeah. This is her, I mean, this is Renee.

23:24.863 --> 23:26.743
Pleasure to meet you, I'm McKenna.

23:26.823 --> 23:28.783
Princess Renee.

23:28.867 --> 23:32.157
So, you're Dylan's manager?

23:33.163 --> 23:35.173
Manager? You a rock star now?

23:35.457 --> 23:38.127
Well, if you'll excuse me, rock star.

23:39.669 --> 23:40.879
That's the crack whore?

23:40.920 --> 23:44.420
Don't call him... Between us, all right?

23:45.467 --> 23:47.887
All right, are you gonna come in?

23:55.727 --> 23:59.557
The very first line of cocaine that I ever took,

23:59.647 --> 24:02.437
the first bump, if you like,

24:02.734 --> 24:05.574
man, I was in love, okay?

24:05.612 --> 24:08.282
It was the love of my life.

24:08.740 --> 24:13.240
Any doubt, any insecurity that I had, gone.

24:13.328 --> 24:16.248
It was bigger than my job,
bigger than my family,

24:16.331 --> 24:18.291
my friends, you know, bigger than me,

24:18.375 --> 24:20.085
and I was a god, remember?

24:20.168 --> 24:24.208
I think rock bottom for me

24:25.799 --> 24:28.549
was a three-day cocaine binge.

24:28.635 --> 24:32.215
I was a mess. I was, you know, bloody nose

24:32.263 --> 24:35.023
and I wasn't sleeping obviously

24:35.058 --> 24:36.938
and I'd run out, I couldn't get anymore.

24:37.018 --> 24:40.268
So I was scrabbling around on the floor

24:40.355 --> 24:44.225
looking for crumbs in the carpet.

24:45.276 --> 24:50.316
And I drank a bottle of vodka
and my heart stopped and I flatlined.

24:51.991 --> 24:55.541
I actually ended up withdrawing on my own
at my parents' house,

24:55.578 --> 24:57.408
I was

24:57.580 --> 24:59.580
lying on my... My parent's couch

24:59.749 --> 25:03.209
and my father just sitting there

25:03.253 --> 25:05.513
holding my hand and...

25:05.922 --> 25:08.382
He had his other hand on my head

25:09.342 --> 25:12.392
the way that...

25:14.973 --> 25:17.603
I don't have any conclusions for you guys.

25:17.767 --> 25:19.767
I'm very much a work in progress myself.

25:19.853 --> 25:22.403
But if you take anything from today,

25:22.439 --> 25:25.279
let it be that addiction is real.
It's bigger than you are.

25:39.873 --> 25:41.293
Shit, shit!

26:38.848 --> 26:40.478
I know a place.

26:41.935 --> 26:44.345
-You want me to make a...
-Yes, yes.

26:46.606 --> 26:50.106
You know, down there
there's a trampoline, somewhere.

26:53.446 --> 26:55.236
Renee Yohe?

27:09.546 --> 27:12.046
So I'll take it. When can I move in?

27:15.301 --> 27:17.601
So do you have drugs in your system?

27:17.679 --> 27:20.559
Yeah. Don't most people who come here?

27:22.350 --> 27:26.520
So what drugs have you taken
in the last 72 hours?

27:26.771 --> 27:29.361
Some uppers, mostly just coke.

27:29.858 --> 27:30.858
That it?

27:32.736 --> 27:34.066
Alcohol.

27:35.572 --> 27:38.242
Ecstasy, but not that much.

27:39.159 --> 27:43.829
What about legal drugs, prescriptions?
You know, for conditions.

27:43.913 --> 27:49.883
I'm here because I have a drug problem.
Not prescription drug problem.

27:49.961 --> 27:53.381
You ever been diagnosed
with any mood disorders?

27:58.011 --> 27:59.261
Miss Yohe?

27:59.429 --> 28:04.269
I don't see how that has
anything to do with anything. Sorry.

28:07.103 --> 28:08.943
How long have you
been off your medication?

28:09.022 --> 28:10.402
Are you gonna let me in or no?

28:10.565 --> 28:12.065
Is my audition finished?

28:12.108 --> 28:14.528
You need a dance
or a little song or something?

28:14.694 --> 28:17.824
No, but I do need to see your arm.

28:19.074 --> 28:20.834
Congratulations, guys.

28:20.909 --> 28:24.999
You brought me to the only rehab
that doesn't take drug addicts.

28:25.080 --> 28:26.080
I didn't make the cut, let's go.

28:26.122 --> 28:28.082
-This isn't a detox center, you know that.
-Yeah, but...

28:28.166 --> 28:29.536
You need to bring her back when she's clean.

28:29.626 --> 28:31.956
-Are you kidding me?
-Like... Is that a joke?

28:32.045 --> 28:33.505
-Guys...
-Guys, just give me a second.

28:33.546 --> 28:35.876
Conrad, let her detox here.
What's the problem?

28:36.216 --> 28:38.756
We're not equipped, we're not insured
to deal with detoxing.

28:38.843 --> 28:41.223
You can't take drug addicts?
Then who gets rehabbed here?

28:41.262 --> 28:42.722
Bring her back in five days.

28:42.847 --> 28:45.177
She can't sit in a room
without drugs for five days.

28:45.225 --> 28:46.555
That's why we came here.
That's why she's here.

28:46.643 --> 28:48.353
Okay, everybody just needs to calm down.

28:48.395 --> 28:50.805
No, you don't understand how hard it was
to get her here.

28:50.897 --> 28:55.067
Stop! Stop! This is why I can't.

29:00.448 --> 29:02.698
Let's just go, please.

29:12.711 --> 29:15.381
My God. Who does that?

29:15.505 --> 29:16.585
So how do you know this girl?

29:18.299 --> 29:19.879
We just met.

29:21.845 --> 29:23.715
Come on, let her in.

29:24.472 --> 29:28.022
Look, you saw her arm.
She could trigger the other girls. I can't...

29:28.059 --> 29:30.439
I can't risk a fresh cut.
You know the deal, David.

29:30.520 --> 29:32.270
Just bring her back.

29:32.397 --> 29:33.727
Hey.

29:34.399 --> 29:37.739
Where you been,
why haven't I seen you at meetings lately?

29:38.361 --> 29:40.241
You know, business.

29:40.321 --> 29:42.451
Yeah. I know bullshit.

29:42.782 --> 29:45.662
This might be a very good thing
to happen for you, you know.

29:46.369 --> 29:50.539
-Nothing is happening to me.
-Five days, no drugs, no new cuts.

29:50.665 --> 29:52.035
I can't commit to that!

29:52.083 --> 29:53.883
Well, I remember somebody
committing to that for you.

29:54.085 --> 29:56.665
-You're an asshole.
-Bring her back.

29:57.047 --> 29:58.917
I can't do that.

30:03.553 --> 30:06.853
Wow, I haven't seen your parents
in, like, forever.

30:06.931 --> 30:08.351
Yeah, me neither.

30:17.942 --> 30:19.942
-Renee!
-Hey, baby!

30:20.070 --> 30:23.070
Oh, my God, I haven't seen you in forever.

30:23.114 --> 30:24.164
Think you can stay?

30:24.240 --> 30:27.540
April, honey, go inside, please.

30:27.577 --> 30:28.657
Can Renee come in?

30:29.204 --> 30:31.294
Honey, inside, please.

30:34.250 --> 30:37.170
-Hey, Dad.
-Hello, Renee.

30:37.462 --> 30:38.842
I...

30:39.631 --> 30:42.011
I'm gonna go to rehab in a few days.

30:42.592 --> 30:45.142
Good, good, that's really good.

30:45.929 --> 30:47.469
And I just need to...

30:47.555 --> 30:53.725
Actually, I was wondering if I could stay here
for, like, just until I go.

30:53.895 --> 30:55.605
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

30:55.689 --> 30:57.109
Crap.

30:57.899 --> 30:59.069
He's not gonna let her stay.

30:59.734 --> 31:01.244
Can she stay at your place?

31:01.277 --> 31:04.947
No. My dad's not into sleepovers.
Not since my mom died.

31:05.031 --> 31:06.411
She can stay with me.

31:06.616 --> 31:08.116
Yeah, that's a great idea, Dylan.

31:08.201 --> 31:09.621
What's wrong with his?

31:09.703 --> 31:12.463
I don't know.
Just his mother being a raging alcoholic

31:12.539 --> 31:14.789
might get in the way. No big deal.

31:14.874 --> 31:17.094
Dad, I literally don't have anywhere else
I can go.

31:17.210 --> 31:20.800
I'm sorry. I promised myself
it wasn't going to happen again, okay?

31:21.715 --> 31:23.835
And the last time you stayed here,

31:23.883 --> 31:26.553
-it was your... Please just listen to me.
-I know... No, don't...

31:26.594 --> 31:28.394
It was your sister who found your blood.

31:28.430 --> 31:31.730
Okay, I am aware of that.
It's not going to happen ever again.

31:31.766 --> 31:34.226
You don't understand, Dad.
If you don't let me stay here...

31:34.352 --> 31:35.732
-No, I do understand.
-...I have nowhere else to go.

31:36.021 --> 31:38.441
Five minutes.
Thank you, thank you very much.

31:38.565 --> 31:39.565
-David?
-Yes?

31:39.607 --> 31:41.607
-Can she stay with you?
-No, she can't.

31:41.693 --> 31:43.153
I can't let it happen to your sister
and I can't...

31:43.236 --> 31:45.906
Dad, you can't! You have to let me stay here.

31:46.114 --> 31:48.414
-Please.
-No. She's your friend, mate.

31:48.450 --> 31:49.740
But you just stood up in church and said

31:49.784 --> 31:51.454
how important it is for people
to have strong support.

31:51.536 --> 31:54.036
I know what I just did and I am having
a tough time at the moment, Dylan.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.750
-I've got a lot on my...
-Please. I know. So is she!

31:55.915 --> 31:57.535
-You love me so much?
-I would do anything for you, but...

31:57.625 --> 31:59.625
You don't want me to sleep in my room
so I can get better?

31:59.711 --> 32:01.171
-Dylan, please.
-...go home to something like this.

32:01.212 --> 32:02.842
-Can I just have five seconds to try...
-She trusts you.

32:02.881 --> 32:05.551
-And you have a huge house.
-You have a huge house?

32:05.717 --> 32:07.887
-Well, it's big!
-Fine!

32:09.554 --> 32:11.644
You shut up, and you stop sulking,

32:11.723 --> 32:14.183
and you're all staying at my place.

32:14.351 --> 32:15.481
...one of the things I can't do...

32:15.560 --> 32:16.640
You would not do anything

32:16.728 --> 32:18.478
because you're not letting me sleep
where I need to sleep!

32:18.563 --> 32:19.613
Mr. Yohe, my name's David McKenna.

32:19.689 --> 32:22.399
Do you mind if Renee stays with me
for a couple of days?

32:24.319 --> 32:25.699
She's gonna need to get some things.

32:54.974 --> 32:56.394
Lovely.

33:04.275 --> 33:06.735
You moving out or you moving in?

33:06.778 --> 33:07.948
Not sure yet.

33:08.029 --> 33:09.069
This is fancy.

33:10.907 --> 33:12.367
-Hey, Renee.
-Yep.

33:13.201 --> 33:17.411
In this house
there's no booze and no drugs. Okay?

33:17.497 --> 33:20.537
Just sleep, coffee and cigarettes.

33:20.583 --> 33:22.713
My number one rule, we don't get tired
and we don't get hungry.

33:25.046 --> 33:26.046
Okay.

33:26.131 --> 33:27.971
-You in?
-I'm in.

33:28.216 --> 33:29.716
Let's do it.

33:31.261 --> 33:35.221
Okay, kitchen, my quarters, hot tub,
you lot can park it upstairs,

33:35.306 --> 33:37.596
middle room's my office, no kids allowed.
We clear?

33:37.684 --> 33:40.444
And you got first dibs. You two...

33:47.652 --> 33:50.362
Addiction is a very complicated relationship.

33:50.572 --> 33:52.572
We've been friends with Renee
for, like, 12 years.

33:52.657 --> 33:54.657
-Trust me, we know.
-Okay, all right.

33:54.743 --> 33:56.083
This is not Renee.

33:57.245 --> 34:00.575
<i>You have to thinkInvasion of
the Body Snatchersor something, okay?</i>

34:01.583 --> 34:04.673
Every single thing in her,
every fiber of her being

34:04.711 --> 34:07.011
wants one thing, is thinking about one thing,

34:07.047 --> 34:09.917
cares about one thing and it's not you,
and it's not me.

34:10.257 --> 34:12.047
It's drugs, okay?

34:12.344 --> 34:13.853
So what do we do?

34:13.887 --> 34:15.137
What we do is...

34:15.221 --> 34:19.271
Okay, the game plan is distractions,
distractions, distractions. Okay?

34:19.351 --> 34:21.900
Dylan, you're on snack duty, okay?

34:21.936 --> 34:24.856
Take Renee, don't let her out of your sight.
Come straight back.

34:24.938 --> 34:27.529
She'll ask you to go someplace else,
you don't go, you don't deviate,

34:27.567 --> 34:29.937
you come back here.
Half an hour, 30 minutes. All right?

34:30.027 --> 34:32.277
Or I'm coming after you. Jessie?

34:33.031 --> 34:35.741
Jessie, take all the knives and anything
sharp in the house and hide them.

34:36.076 --> 34:37.735
You want me to
hide all the knives in the house?

34:38.036 --> 34:39.746
Did you see her arm?

34:41.331 --> 34:44.041
Look, all the ways you want to punish Renee
for being a shit friend

34:44.208 --> 34:46.248
will pale in comparison to the ways
Renee will punish herself.

34:46.335 --> 34:48.246
Now get on with it.

34:49.047 --> 34:50.877
All right, let's go.

34:51.091 --> 34:54.051
Dylan? Don't forget my Lucky Charms.

34:59.683 --> 35:02.733
Animal crackers! Oh, yes!

35:05.522 --> 35:07.072
I missed you.

35:07.524 --> 35:10.364
Yeah, I mean, why did we stop hanging out
in the first place?

35:10.485 --> 35:13.655
What is this? What are we doing?
We're hanging out.

35:13.738 --> 35:15.368
We used to hang out, like, every day together

35:15.407 --> 35:17.867
and now you're a completely different person

35:17.909 --> 35:20.079
doing different things and I don't know...

35:20.161 --> 35:22.291
Different things?

35:23.164 --> 35:24.424
You know what I'm talking about.

35:24.541 --> 35:26.381
-I know what you're talking about.
-You know.

35:26.710 --> 35:28.960
Why did you do that to your arm?

35:31.381 --> 35:33.431
It just looked right.

35:33.508 --> 35:37.428
Well, I like the way you look without it.
'Cause it's not true.

35:37.762 --> 35:39.062
Crap, sorry. I didn't know this was...

35:39.764 --> 35:42.314
No, no, no. I got this. I got this.

35:42.475 --> 35:44.055
Okay.

37:37.799 --> 37:39.929
Whoa, McKenna, whoa!

37:40.010 --> 37:41.550
Jamie!

37:42.554 --> 37:44.564
You nearly gave me a heart attack,
you wanker.

37:44.639 --> 37:46.099
When did we start sounding the alarm?

37:46.725 --> 37:47.725
Today.

37:47.767 --> 37:48.807
And when did we get new friends?

37:49.269 --> 37:50.269
Keeping her safe.

37:51.896 --> 37:53.566
-Obvious enough.
-Renee,

37:53.648 --> 37:57.148
meet Jamie, my sometimes housemate,
who I'm guessing missed his flight.

37:57.402 --> 37:58.572
Jessie. Good night.

37:58.945 --> 38:01.065
Dylan took your room,
so you can bunk with him.

38:01.573 --> 38:04.663
All right! Bunk buddies. See you up there.

38:04.743 --> 38:08.083
This is David McKenna.
Everything's fine, false alarm.

38:12.083 --> 38:14.673
Want some Lucky Charms?

38:19.215 --> 38:24.045
I know this isn't any of my business,
but you all right, Renee?

38:24.137 --> 38:26.507
I'm a coozer.

38:26.765 --> 38:30.185
-A coozer?
-It's coke and booze together.

38:30.226 --> 38:32.596
I made it up, do you like it?

38:34.689 --> 38:37.899
Yeah. I don't think McKenna coozes much.

38:38.234 --> 38:39.904
He's such a quitter.

38:40.945 --> 38:43.565
So what's you're... Who do you...
What's your deal?

38:45.116 --> 38:47.616
I'm actually a lot more
interested in you right now.

38:47.702 --> 38:48.752
I'll bet.

38:51.748 --> 38:55.418
I need a place to detox for a few days
till I go to rehab

38:55.502 --> 38:59.592
and McKenna is donating to my charity.

39:00.632 --> 39:02.472
Nosy.

39:02.717 --> 39:05.097
I didn't mean to be nosy.

39:05.553 --> 39:07.643
I'm just really...

39:08.848 --> 39:10.138
That's really brave.

39:10.725 --> 39:12.385
I'm happy for you.

39:15.105 --> 39:16.725
Why doesn't he have knives?

39:20.568 --> 39:21.568
So what do you do?

39:22.904 --> 39:26.914
I am a rep for a surf company.

39:27.283 --> 39:31.253
McKenna's nice enough to let me crash here
when I'm in town.

39:31.663 --> 39:33.583
-You're like a traveling salesman?
-Yeah.

39:34.082 --> 39:35.712
Legit job.

39:35.792 --> 39:38.592
Office. Grown-up stuff.

39:39.212 --> 39:42.012
But what I really wanna do is write.

39:44.843 --> 39:46.763
You like Paper Route?

39:46.845 --> 39:48.845
They're playing at
the Florida Music Fest tomorrow.

39:49.597 --> 39:51.677
Yeah. We should go.
You think the warden will let you out?

39:51.891 --> 39:54.061
I will dig my way out.

39:54.894 --> 39:56.484
Right on.

39:57.939 --> 39:59.979
So you out tomorrow morning or...

40:00.358 --> 40:02.568
Actually the day after, if that's okay with you.

40:02.652 --> 40:04.242
Yeah, the more the merrier.

40:04.404 --> 40:07.034
All right, thank you.

40:07.157 --> 40:08.947
No problem.

40:10.452 --> 40:12.332
Appreciate it.

40:13.705 --> 40:16.705
And congratulations on your new life, Renee.

40:18.043 --> 40:20.213
-Good night.
-Bye!

40:24.549 --> 40:26.759
Pretty good.

40:28.345 --> 40:29.595
How are you feeling?

40:30.055 --> 40:31.845
Like my soul got kicked in the nuts.

40:33.266 --> 40:34.476
Good.

40:34.684 --> 40:39.064
Well, not good that you feel
like your soul's been kicked in the balls,

40:39.439 --> 40:42.779
but it's good you're being honest.
Secrets make you sick.

40:43.735 --> 40:45.065
I like that, McKenna.

40:45.195 --> 40:47.355
-Remember it.
-Yes, sir.

40:51.076 --> 40:52.656
Thank you

40:53.745 --> 40:55.365
for all of this.

40:56.748 --> 40:58.748
Somebody did it for me,
you'll do it for someone else.

41:00.085 --> 41:02.545
All right, thanks for the sandwich.

41:03.213 --> 41:04.803
Sleep tight.

41:21.314 --> 41:22.774
This is slave labor.

41:22.982 --> 41:24.942
I prefer the term internship.

41:25.068 --> 41:26.778
It's all gonna be back next week.

41:27.153 --> 41:29.413
So will you. It's a test of wills, mate.

41:30.407 --> 41:32.117
-Hey.
-There she is!

41:32.367 --> 41:34.367
You all right, sleeping beauty?

41:38.248 --> 41:41.328
You have an extra one of those... Thank you.

41:42.627 --> 41:44.127
Hey, boss?

41:44.295 --> 41:47.215
I have three...
No, I have four questions for you.

41:47.382 --> 41:50.222
-I'll answer two. Maybe.
-Okay.

41:50.343 --> 41:52.103
One, why don't you have any furniture?

41:52.178 --> 41:53.718
Two, where'd you get your tattoo,

41:53.847 --> 41:58.597
three, how come you left England,
and four, I'll ask you later.

41:58.727 --> 42:00.397
One, I just haven't found the right sofa yet,

42:00.437 --> 42:03.607
I wish people would stop pressuring me,
and two, I got that bad boy in prison.

42:03.732 --> 42:05.282
Prison? What did you do?

42:05.400 --> 42:07.740
Only answering two questions.

42:08.069 --> 42:11.069
-Hey! Right on.
-Hey, Jamie!

42:11.156 --> 42:12.236
Looking great, guys.

42:12.532 --> 42:14.992
So what are you doing
your last night in Orlando?

42:15.076 --> 42:17.496
I was thinking Florida Music Fest.

42:18.538 --> 42:20.748
I mean, your band's playing, right?
We'll all go together.

42:21.041 --> 42:24.211
You have bands? McKenna, I wanna go.

42:24.502 --> 42:27.212
One band, and, no, you can't go,
you're staying with the babysitters.

42:27.964 --> 42:29.424
I thought she needed distractions.

42:29.507 --> 42:32.507
Yeah, if there's music,
I'm not thinking about drugs.

42:32.635 --> 42:35.635
No, there's no drugs at a music festival.
It's a great idea.

42:36.014 --> 42:38.564
Exactly. I don't have extra tickets anyway,
so it's settled.

42:38.725 --> 42:39.845
Turns out Hurley's sponsoring the event.

42:39.893 --> 42:43.523
Made a call, got us VIP treatment
and Paper Route's playing.

42:45.023 --> 42:47.733
And we'll be there
to support your band, Between the Trees.

42:47.901 --> 42:48.941
Why thank you, Jamie.

42:49.277 --> 42:54.987
<i>What would you say if I told you
that I'm not giving up?</i>

42:55.075 --> 42:58.235
<i>However long it takes</i>

43:00.747 --> 43:03.497
<i>It's clear that things have changed</i>

43:03.541 --> 43:05.381
<i>Since when we started</i>

43:05.418 --> 43:08.918
<i>But we can't just walk away, babe</i>

43:09.005 --> 43:11.755
<i>So I am telling you that</i>

43:11.841 --> 43:18.221
<i>I know things aren't quite
like what they used to be</i>

43:20.392 --> 43:22.272
<i>Different faces,
different places</i>

43:22.394 --> 43:26.114
I needed this. Thank you.

43:28.233 --> 43:29.733
You're welcome.

43:32.362 --> 43:35.492
Boys, nice one, well done, more of
the same please. That was the bollocks.

43:35.824 --> 43:37.204
So when are we gonna meet Stevo?

43:37.242 --> 43:39.452
Just let me handle the business.

43:39.536 --> 43:41.406
You're going to meet him
right after the second set.

43:41.496 --> 43:43.326
Go make daddy proud.

43:45.917 --> 43:50.837
<i>Where have I landed
I don't quite remember</i>

43:50.880 --> 43:56.050
<i>I fell to pieces
one night in December</i>

43:56.136 --> 43:59.556
<i>The memories of losing you</i>

43:59.597 --> 44:02.057
<i>You're like a ghost</i>

44:02.100 --> 44:05.650
<i>Tracing where I said to you</i>

44:05.729 --> 44:08.309
<i>I wish you would listen</i>

44:08.398 --> 44:10.478
-Lift me up!
-Oh, no!

44:10.567 --> 44:14.397
Yes, Dylan, lift me up! Lift me up! Come on!

44:14.529 --> 44:17.069
Please, you guys, if anyone
is doing drugs up there,

44:17.157 --> 44:18.737
I will come right down immediately.

44:19.075 --> 44:20.445
They might be.

44:20.577 --> 44:22.577
No, no, no. McKenna will kill me.

44:22.704 --> 44:24.714
-Please, please, Dylan.
-Just watch from right here.

44:24.831 --> 44:26.831
Come on, one...

44:27.459 --> 44:28.959
Be right back?

44:29.044 --> 44:32.384
Girl scout's honor. One, two, three!

44:33.548 --> 44:38.508
<i>Looking for love like
a bride looks for dresses</i>

44:38.553 --> 44:41.933
<i>The memories of losing you</i>

44:42.015 --> 44:44.425
<i>You're like a ghost</i>

44:44.517 --> 44:47.807
<i>Tracing where I said to you</i>

44:47.896 --> 44:50.646
<i>I wish you would listen</i>

44:50.732 --> 44:53.282
<i>I wish you would listen</i>

44:53.360 --> 44:55.860
<i>I wish you would listen</i>

44:55.904 --> 44:57.704
<i>To get through it</i>

44:58.323 --> 45:00.663
<i>I wish you would listen</i>

45:00.867 --> 45:01.987
McKenna?

45:02.077 --> 45:03.447
-Stevo.
-What's up?

45:03.536 --> 45:04.576
-How you doing?
-Good.

45:04.662 --> 45:05.872
-Safe trip?
-All good.

45:05.914 --> 45:09.384
Okay, good. Anyway, listen,
are you a Between the Trees fan yet?

45:10.251 --> 45:12.881
-We'll see.
-Okay.

45:12.921 --> 45:14.051
When can I meet the band?

45:14.130 --> 45:17.840
I'll introduce you right after the second set.
Listen, would you excuse me a minute, yeah?

45:18.510 --> 45:20.010
Hey, where's Renee?

45:20.053 --> 45:21.053
She's up there, we just put her up there.

45:21.513 --> 45:25.933
Tell me you are joking. You put her up there?
We're at a music festival!

45:26.101 --> 45:28.141
It's fine, McKenna!

45:28.645 --> 45:30.055
Well, she's not there now!

45:30.146 --> 45:32.146
I told you this was a bad idea!

45:32.232 --> 45:35.072
Okay, Jessie, you go that way,
you get back in the crowd

45:35.110 --> 45:37.490
and you come with me!

45:47.455 --> 45:50.035
-Yohe! Yohe!
-Hey!

45:50.750 --> 45:53.460
Where you been?
What happened to you back in Daytona?

45:53.545 --> 45:55.205
What, you get saved or kidnapped
or something?

45:55.296 --> 45:58.296
A little bit of both.
I lost my group I came with.

45:58.758 --> 46:02.758
Why don't you get in,
I'll take you around the front by the stage.

46:08.768 --> 46:12.648
Hey, wanna go downtown?
I got some mad snow not far from here.

46:12.731 --> 46:15.191
No, no more snow. I'm done with that.

46:15.275 --> 46:18.355
Two days sober, man, three days to rehab.

46:18.445 --> 46:19.855
How Hollywood of you.

46:19.904 --> 46:21.994
Come on, you sure you don't want to go out
with a bang?

46:22.073 --> 46:23.703
No. Take me back.

46:24.034 --> 46:25.374
All right.

46:28.830 --> 46:31.880
-Renee!
-Hey, hey, hold on.

46:32.500 --> 46:36.090
Hey, all right. Thanks.

46:36.212 --> 46:37.882
Sure thing. Stay safe.

46:38.006 --> 46:40.296
Yeah, you too. Hey.

46:41.343 --> 46:43.393
Is that one of your boyfriends?

46:43.553 --> 46:45.813
What's your problem? No, no.
What's your problem?

46:45.889 --> 46:48.179
Did you just go use with that guy?

46:48.224 --> 46:50.484
-Did I just use with that guy?
-Did you just go use with that guy?

46:50.560 --> 46:52.900
No, I didn't go use with that guy, Jess!

46:52.937 --> 46:55.607
Just go home, dude, if you don't want
to be here, you don't have to be here.

46:55.690 --> 46:56.780
I'm sure you'd love that, wouldn't you,

46:56.858 --> 46:58.648
so you could have a house full of men
all to yourself, right?

46:58.735 --> 47:01.195
What are you talking about?

47:01.363 --> 47:03.283
We used to be a family.

47:03.365 --> 47:05.905
-Do you know how much that means to me?
-Yes.

47:05.950 --> 47:10.370
You gave up everything for some prick
at a bullshit rave.

47:10.413 --> 47:13.883
Whoa, you don't know
what happened with Sean. Okay?

47:13.917 --> 47:16.037
I don't care what happened, Renee,
'cause it's not about Sean,

47:16.127 --> 47:19.547
it's about you giving up everything
for the slightest bit of attention.

47:19.673 --> 47:20.843
Listen to me right now.

47:20.882 --> 47:23.842
I will tell you everything right now. He...

47:23.927 --> 47:25.257
Stop right there. Just stop right there.

47:25.345 --> 47:26.805
I don't care and I don't want to hear it.

47:26.888 --> 47:30.808
I'm so sick of
hearing your stories and your sadness

47:30.892 --> 47:33.982
and seeing your pity scars
all over your body.

47:34.062 --> 47:37.072
I'm so sick of it. I'm done.

47:37.148 --> 47:38.898
<i>I want to see what I dream</i>

47:38.983 --> 47:41.283
<i>I want the inconvenience</i>

47:41.361 --> 47:46.531
<i>I hope you see that
when you fall in love...</i>

48:10.724 --> 48:14.194
Stevo, no, no, Stevo's fine, yeah, yeah, yeah,
he loved it.

48:14.269 --> 48:16.559
Yeah, he really did, yeah.

48:16.646 --> 48:19.726
Yeah, something came up.

48:19.774 --> 48:23.574
Just let me deal with the contracts, all right?

48:23.611 --> 48:27.951
No, no, no, no, I'll be there. Yeah.
No, I wouldn't miss it for the world.

48:28.658 --> 48:29.658
Yeah, okay.

48:46.801 --> 48:49.261
You going out for a smoke?

48:54.017 --> 48:56.057
Don't you have a plane to catch?

48:56.519 --> 49:00.149
It's delayed till we get you to rehab.

49:01.358 --> 49:06.648
When I was a little kid I used to say that
planes were like these big friendly giants

49:07.405 --> 49:12.825
and if I had, like, a bad dream, bad idea,

49:13.078 --> 49:17.538
a plane would just fly them away.

49:18.124 --> 49:19.714
Sounds beautiful.

49:23.755 --> 49:25.965
Just wanna escape all this shit.

49:29.219 --> 49:32.429
Yeah, you know, you remind me
of my friend, Zeke.

49:33.098 --> 49:34.218
Zeke.

49:34.307 --> 49:37.017
He'd say the worst part of his day
was the paddling back to shore.

49:37.435 --> 49:39.805
-Surfing?
-Yeah. He was a surf buddy.

49:43.191 --> 49:44.441
He died two months ago.

49:45.360 --> 49:51.200
Took his own life. Now, I don't know
if I could have said something.

49:52.409 --> 49:56.369
But I wanna be the guy
who can say the right thing.

49:56.413 --> 49:58.043
You know?

50:01.042 --> 50:03.842
I think people might need more than words.

50:05.547 --> 50:06.627
Maybe.

50:11.886 --> 50:17.016
-You all right?
-Yeah, I think I... I think.

50:18.810 --> 50:21.400
Is she okay? Is she all right?

50:23.189 --> 50:24.819
-No.
-Need some water?

50:25.150 --> 50:27.190
-A blanket?
-She needs a bed.

50:28.403 --> 50:31.243
Here's a bucket, in case you need to...

50:31.322 --> 50:34.662
-I'm so cold.
-It's all right, I got it.

50:36.953 --> 50:41.213
My dad put this by my bed
every time I was ill.

50:41.249 --> 50:42.499
Let me get you some water.

50:45.837 --> 50:47.587
Is this normal?

50:48.089 --> 50:49.669
This is the worst part.

50:50.508 --> 50:52.138
Great.

50:52.218 --> 50:53.678
I'll be next door, okay?

50:54.971 --> 50:57.271
Yeah, hang in there.

51:24.250 --> 51:25.460
I missed you.

51:29.422 --> 51:30.722
You wanna go for a ride?

51:31.841 --> 51:33.471
No.

51:51.277 --> 51:52.607
Am I ever going to be okay?

51:56.574 --> 51:59.414
Why did you make me like this?

52:14.801 --> 52:16.471
No, ma'am. What are you thinking...

52:18.930 --> 52:21.470
<i>She's hurting herself. She's cutting herself,</i>

52:21.558 --> 52:24.228
<i>and I don't understand.
What is wrong with her?</i>

52:25.228 --> 52:28.768
<i>Those pills are nothing. I don't want her...
I don't want her taking all those pills,</i>

52:28.857 --> 52:30.357
<i>do you understand?</i>

52:31.401 --> 52:32.861
<i>Why does she keep doing these things?</i>

52:32.902 --> 52:35.782
<i>It doesn't help to ask why.</i>

52:36.489 --> 52:40.619
<i>Why can't we help it? Why is she doing
these things? She's hurting herself.</i>

53:55.694 --> 53:57.364
What did I say?

53:57.404 --> 54:02.124
All business comes and goes through me.

54:02.200 --> 54:05.250
No, that's... No, I...

54:05.328 --> 54:08.158
No, you... No, you...

54:08.248 --> 54:11.128
Will you let me speak? Please?

54:11.334 --> 54:13.884
You really wanna have this conversation?

54:14.004 --> 54:19.724
Three months ago you were performing
for a bunch of drunks in a bloody toilet.

54:20.635 --> 54:22.255
Don't you ever speak to me like that!

54:26.266 --> 54:27.386
Shit!

54:40.739 --> 54:41.909
Patio.

54:56.713 --> 54:58.343
It's nice, huh?

55:07.932 --> 55:10.812
-Bombay Bitches.
-What?

55:10.935 --> 55:13.895
Your third question.
The reason I left England.

55:13.980 --> 55:17.570
For a band.
I got stuck here in Orlando for a few more.

55:17.692 --> 55:19.572
Bombay Bitches.

55:24.115 --> 55:27.155
Yeah, yeah, all right, I do know it,
you can stop, thank you.

55:28.119 --> 55:31.709
They were also the reason
I hit rock bottom fairly predictably.

55:31.873 --> 55:36.673
So is that how you did it?
You started over somewhere new and...

55:37.212 --> 55:40.472
No. That didn't work for me.

55:41.341 --> 55:43.431
The problem was always me.

55:43.510 --> 55:47.010
Wherever I went, there I was.

55:48.723 --> 55:51.233
A friend once said to me
that I should never be left unattended

55:51.309 --> 55:53.519
because what I get back to is me.

55:54.688 --> 55:56.688
And me is the problem.

55:57.982 --> 55:59.032
You need other people.

56:01.945 --> 56:04.105
What's today's date?

56:04.989 --> 56:06.619
The 15th.

56:06.825 --> 56:08.865
-I have to go somewhere. Please.
-Not a chance.

56:08.910 --> 56:14.000
Please, please. I'll take Dylan. It'll be fine.
Please. It's important.

56:14.541 --> 56:17.171
Take Dylan. One hour.
I'm trusting you, all right?

56:17.210 --> 56:18.710
Thank you.

56:31.558 --> 56:34.308
Your dad said you were here.

56:36.938 --> 56:38.398
I'm really sorry we forgot.

56:43.737 --> 56:45.237
I miss you.

56:48.575 --> 56:49.735
It was like you died too, you know.

56:52.912 --> 56:54.212
I didn't.

56:54.748 --> 56:58.538
I miss her so much and I can't lose you, too.

57:06.384 --> 57:08.894
Why did you stop calling us?

57:09.554 --> 57:11.434
It was just overnight,
you just stopped calling us.

57:15.643 --> 57:17.193
I just...

57:18.229 --> 57:22.729
Something happened
and I just didn't want to talk about it.

57:23.443 --> 57:28.913
I wanted to be alone and it just got...
It got out of hand.

57:29.032 --> 57:31.282
What are you talking about?

57:31.409 --> 57:33.119
Halloween party.

57:33.703 --> 57:39.213
Sean pulled over in a parking lot
so I could throw up.

57:51.971 --> 57:53.471
<i>And he raped me.</i>

58:00.689 --> 58:02.149
I mean, we had no idea.

58:02.732 --> 58:04.482
I'm so sorry.

58:04.693 --> 58:07.243
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

58:08.613 --> 58:13.163
I'm sorry about everything I said at
the concert. I'm sorry about everything.

58:13.368 --> 58:15.038
I'm sorry.

58:16.037 --> 58:17.787
Will you please come back to McKenna's?

58:17.872 --> 58:21.172
I'll come back. I promise.

59:28.568 --> 59:30.148
All right, everyone, pay attention.

59:30.236 --> 59:33.406
She is never alone. Got it?

59:33.448 --> 59:35.908
And no crowd surfing
in the record shop, please,

59:35.992 --> 59:38.202
thank you very much, if you don't mind.

59:38.745 --> 59:39.945
Daja Grace.

59:40.038 --> 59:42.868
-I think it's Dasia, isn't it?
-Man.

59:42.999 --> 59:44.329
-What?
-Look.

59:44.376 --> 59:46.796
-You don't need that.
-I know.

59:46.878 --> 59:52.378
It's just the idea of eternal sobriety
scares me very much.

59:52.717 --> 59:54.047
-One day at a time.
-Right.

59:54.094 --> 59:55.144
Yeah.

59:55.220 --> 59:58.470
At least that's what my mom said
right before she relapsed.

59:59.057 --> 01:00:00.677
Good.

01:00:05.730 --> 01:00:07.070
Now that is impressive.

01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:09.571
-Coffee?
-Thank you.

01:00:09.943 --> 01:00:11.363
-That's cool.
-Yeah.

01:00:11.403 --> 01:00:15.573
The metalmark is the most beautiful butterfly.

01:00:15.615 --> 01:00:18.985
And it's the most fragile,
as it only lives a week.

01:00:20.745 --> 01:00:22.405
Isn't that sad?

01:00:24.082 --> 01:00:25.332
I wanted to ask you something.

01:00:25.375 --> 01:00:28.835
-Yeah?
-Don't get angry. It's kind of crazy.

01:00:28.878 --> 01:00:31.208
I love crazy. I'm insane.

01:00:33.216 --> 01:00:36.546
I want to write. I want to tell your story.

01:00:37.679 --> 01:00:40.889
-You want to write my story?
-Yeah, I do.

01:00:41.891 --> 01:00:47.401
It's powerful and because nobody says...

01:00:48.523 --> 01:00:51.743
Nobody talks about all the things
that happen to you.

01:00:51.901 --> 01:00:52.941
-You know?
-I know.

01:00:53.028 --> 01:00:55.318
And I just... I think it will help somebody.

01:00:57.782 --> 01:00:59.242
-Oh, God.
-You think it'll help...

01:00:59.325 --> 01:01:00.785
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-No, no, no, no, no!

01:01:00.869 --> 01:01:05.289
Jamie, I'm just...
You think it could help people, like...

01:01:06.708 --> 01:01:08.038
Yeah, I do.

01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:12.510
Okay, then do it. Sure.

01:01:12.547 --> 01:01:15.217
<i>Thanks for coming out to open mic night.</i>

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:19.300
<i>-First up is Dylan Landers. Dylan?
-What?</i>

01:01:20.972 --> 01:01:23.432
Shit! Did you hear that?

01:01:23.516 --> 01:01:25.766
Get your stuff. We're going to the front.

01:01:27.354 --> 01:01:29.314
Hello.

01:01:29.397 --> 01:01:31.567
<i>My name is Dylan.</i>

01:01:31.608 --> 01:01:33.148
<i>Sorry.</i>

01:01:33.568 --> 01:01:34.818
<i>So this is a...</i>

01:01:34.903 --> 01:01:38.323
<i>I've never really done this before.
This is my first time.</i>

01:01:38.406 --> 01:01:41.906
<i>So today, tomorrow, actually,</i>

01:01:41.951 --> 01:01:47.001
<i>my best friend, Renee, is going to rehab.
For drugs. And...</i>

01:01:47.082 --> 01:01:49.462
<i>Not, like, to get drugs, but...
'Cause they don't...</i>

01:01:49.542 --> 01:01:50.882
<i>I don't think they have drugs there.</i>

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.380
<i>So I want to sing a song for her.</i>

01:01:53.421 --> 01:01:55.421
<i>It's sort of like...</i>

01:01:55.507 --> 01:01:58.177
<i>It's kind of like a prayer in reverse.</i>

01:01:58.218 --> 01:02:00.548
<i>No, it's like, it's good. Here it goes.</i>

01:02:08.061 --> 01:02:13.861
<i>Come up to meet you
Tell you I'm sorry</i>

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:19.950
<i>You don't know how lovely you are</i>

01:02:20.031 --> 01:02:25.951
<i>I had to find you
Tell you I need you</i>

01:02:26.037 --> 01:02:31.127
<i>Tell you I set you apart</i>

01:02:31.835 --> 01:02:37.375
<i>Tell me your secrets
Ask me your questions</i>

01:02:37.841 --> 01:02:42.471
<i>Oh, let's go back to the start</i>

01:02:43.263 --> 01:02:48.233
<i>Nobody said it was easy</i>

01:02:49.394 --> 01:02:53.654
<i>It's such a shame for us to part</i>

01:02:54.649 --> 01:02:59.989
<i>Nobody said it was easy</i>

01:03:00.739 --> 01:03:06.579
<i>No one ever said
It would be this hard</i>

01:03:08.747 --> 01:03:12.707
<i>I'm going back to the start</i>

01:03:27.265 --> 01:03:29.135
-Hey.
-Hey, hey, hey.

01:03:29.225 --> 01:03:30.345
That was a fun day, right?

01:03:30.393 --> 01:03:32.903
Yeah, fun, fun.

01:03:35.482 --> 01:03:37.322
Flying out?

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:41.030
Yeah, I'm taking
the big friendly giant tomorrow.

01:03:41.071 --> 01:03:42.951
No, don't steal my line.

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:51.370
I have a little... I have a little...
I just wanna give you something.

01:03:51.414 --> 01:03:53.964
-But it's weird.
-All right.

01:03:54.042 --> 01:03:56.382
Okay. Ready?

01:03:57.545 --> 01:03:59.705
Here, hold it like...

01:04:00.548 --> 01:04:01.878
Okay.

01:04:03.218 --> 01:04:07.638
I don't trust myself with it and I...

01:04:07.722 --> 01:04:10.352
I would like to throw it away.

01:04:11.559 --> 01:04:16.109
But maybe you can do that instead.

01:04:26.616 --> 01:04:29.736
-Okay.
-Thank you.

01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:36.880
-Let's take a ride.
-Okay.

01:04:53.184 --> 01:04:54.734
Come on.

01:04:58.189 --> 01:05:01.319
Can you believe
he still drives the same stupid truck?

01:05:01.401 --> 01:05:04.701
Sean is a janitor now. He's a real winner.

01:05:04.738 --> 01:05:06.908
-Take the first one?
-No.

01:05:07.532 --> 01:05:08.702
Take it.

01:05:09.117 --> 01:05:10.197
Come on, we're not doing this.

01:05:10.243 --> 01:05:11.333
-Take it!
-This is stupid. No.

01:05:11.411 --> 01:05:14.251
-I'm not doing this. I wanna go back, please.
-Hey, Renee.

01:05:14.330 --> 01:05:17.080
You need this. You don't even understand
how bad you need this.

01:05:17.167 --> 01:05:19.747
I don't need this. I don't need this.
I don't need this.

01:05:19.836 --> 01:05:21.336
He took you from us.
He took you from everything.

01:05:21.379 --> 01:05:22.379
Stop!

01:05:22.464 --> 01:05:24.974
Please, I can't. I can't right now.

01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:29.010
Please. Just forget it. It was a long time ago.

01:06:09.386 --> 01:06:11.216
You don't have to...

01:06:15.517 --> 01:06:17.057
Thank you.

01:06:18.228 --> 01:06:20.058
I've got something for you.

01:06:21.898 --> 01:06:24.068
I got this at three months sober.

01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:26.280
It's your watch thingy.

01:06:26.361 --> 01:06:27.741
Here, look.

01:06:29.406 --> 01:06:31.116
No way.

01:06:33.034 --> 01:06:37.414
"God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

01:06:37.497 --> 01:06:41.457
"the courage to change the things I can
and the wisdom to know the difference."

01:06:42.836 --> 01:06:44.166
You have to wind it every day.

01:06:44.212 --> 01:06:48.052
It's a little reminder
to take it one day at a time.

01:06:48.091 --> 01:06:50.221
You're like my fairy godmother.

01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:52.350
Did you just call me a fairy?

01:06:52.387 --> 01:06:53.887
Yes.

01:06:59.519 --> 01:07:02.479
Don't say it. Don't say a word.

01:07:04.441 --> 01:07:06.901
-Love you.
-Love you too.

01:07:18.496 --> 01:07:21.076
-How you doing?
-Better.

01:07:21.166 --> 01:07:23.076
Good. Welcome back.

01:10:49.165 --> 01:10:50.705
<i>In our local hero report,</i>

01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:54.590
<i>one young man is making a difference
in the lives of young people in crisis.</i>

01:10:54.671 --> 01:10:58.301
<i>Jamie Tworkowski wrote a story
about a local girl, Renee Yohe,</i>

01:10:58.383 --> 01:11:01.723
<i>who was suffering from addiction,
depression and bipolar disorder</i>

01:11:02.345 --> 01:11:04.845
<i>and got clean with the help of her friends.</i>

01:11:04.889 --> 01:11:08.979
<i>He posted her story on Myspace titled
"To Write Love On Her Arms"</i>

01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:10.600
<i>and it quickly went viral.</i>

01:11:10.687 --> 01:11:12.107
<i>Remembering her scars,</i>

01:11:12.188 --> 01:11:16.528
<i>he printed the unusual logo on T-shirts
to raise money for her treatment.</i>

01:11:16.568 --> 01:11:19.028
<i>Friends in bands
started to wear our T-shirts.</i>

01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:20.990
<i>You know,
they were really generous with their platform.</i>

01:11:21.072 --> 01:11:23.872
<i>Then something crazy
and unexpected happened.</i>

01:11:23.908 --> 01:11:26.198
<i>Thousands of young adults found the page</i>

01:11:26.244 --> 01:11:30.464
<i>and wrote about their own struggles
of depression, addiction and isolation,</i>

01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:35.090
<i>and an online community was born
and became a legitimate social movement.</i>

01:11:35.170 --> 01:11:37.840
<i>Jamie now runs the nonprofit organization</i>

01:11:37.881 --> 01:11:41.471
<i>that is committed to helping others
with similar issues worldwide.</i>

01:11:41.551 --> 01:11:44.721
<i>Renee Yohe has become a role model
for many young people</i>

01:11:44.804 --> 01:11:48.224
<i>and will be speaking at an event
this Friday in Orlando.</i>

01:11:49.351 --> 01:11:52.101
You know, most people are celebrities
before they go into rehab.

01:11:53.063 --> 01:11:55.863
Next week no one will care. Don't worry.

01:11:55.899 --> 01:11:59.399
Well, if this is McKenna's doing,
I'll skin him alive.

01:12:00.403 --> 01:12:01.743
Did you give him this?

01:12:01.821 --> 01:12:05.241
No, no. That's a story he'll have to tell you.

01:12:08.661 --> 01:12:10.001
Oh, boy.

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:12.620
Yeah? You ready for this?

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.130
I don't know.

01:12:15.210 --> 01:12:16.840
Six months is not a long time.

01:12:17.379 --> 01:12:19.049
Thanks, Doc.

01:12:22.050 --> 01:12:23.300
Hello.

01:12:48.993 --> 01:12:50.753
Renee...

01:12:52.706 --> 01:12:55.206
Sorry, we didn't know
if the surprise was appropriate or anything.

01:12:56.042 --> 01:12:57.502
What's going on?

01:12:57.544 --> 01:12:59.924
-It's like so intense.
-I know.

01:13:00.005 --> 01:13:03.795
I have a manager now
and we're playing some shows

01:13:03.883 --> 01:13:06.053
-and I really want you to come because...
-Shut up. Oh, my God!

01:13:06.803 --> 01:13:08.563
Dylan's a pro.

01:13:08.638 --> 01:13:10.848
Where's McKenna?

01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:12.730
He's taking a break sort of from everything.

01:13:12.767 --> 01:13:13.807
What do you mean?

01:13:13.893 --> 01:13:15.813
His band fired him.

01:13:16.271 --> 01:13:17.401
-No way.
-Yes.

01:13:17.439 --> 01:13:18.729
But he'll be back in a few days.

01:13:18.815 --> 01:13:21.185
-He's just sorting things out.
-Okay.

01:13:21.234 --> 01:13:22.244
Is it my fault?

01:13:22.318 --> 01:13:24.238
-No, no, no.
-'Cause he was babysitting me?

01:13:24.279 --> 01:13:25.279
-No.
-Yeah, it is.

01:13:25.363 --> 01:13:27.623
-No. I would seriously tell you...
-Hi.

01:13:27.699 --> 01:13:29.949
I'm going to go make out with your dad.

01:13:34.414 --> 01:13:37.424
You want some sobriety cake?

01:13:38.376 --> 01:13:40.586
-It's so good.
-Is it?

01:13:40.670 --> 01:13:42.550
This is my second piece,
but I ate the first one in hiding.

01:13:47.385 --> 01:13:48.755
Are you okay?

01:13:49.721 --> 01:13:50.971
Yeah.

01:13:51.681 --> 01:13:53.771
I'm good. It's just a little weird.

01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:55.770
-I know.
-You know what I mean?

01:13:56.978 --> 01:13:58.978
'Cause what are we celebrating, that I'm...

01:13:59.064 --> 01:14:02.034
It's like, "You're normal, yay, party!"

01:14:02.567 --> 01:14:04.437
Well, if you don't want anybody
to be here right now,

01:14:04.527 --> 01:14:05.567
-we can get them out.
-Oh, my God, Jess. Jess.

01:14:05.612 --> 01:14:06.612
Renee!

01:14:07.447 --> 01:14:08.447
Hey!

01:14:09.574 --> 01:14:10.704
Hi!

01:14:10.742 --> 01:14:12.242
I'm so proud of you.

01:14:13.745 --> 01:14:15.365
-Thank you.
-How are you feeling?

01:14:15.413 --> 01:14:18.003
-Much better.
-You look amazing.

01:14:19.876 --> 01:14:23.666
Thanks for all your notes
and sending me letters and all that stuff.

01:14:23.713 --> 01:14:25.053
Of course, of course, of course.

01:14:25.131 --> 01:14:27.131
We have so much to catch up on.

01:14:27.217 --> 01:14:28.337
-It has been a whirlwind!
-I know.

01:14:28.385 --> 01:14:29.465
I want you to come down to the office,

01:14:29.552 --> 01:14:32.972
I want you to see everything that
you've created and what's happened.

01:14:33.765 --> 01:14:34.965
It's beautiful.

01:14:35.058 --> 01:14:36.638
That'd be great, yeah, I'd love to.

01:14:36.726 --> 01:14:38.766
Maybe respond to a few e-mails, yeah?

01:14:39.312 --> 01:14:40.562
Sounds good.

01:14:40.647 --> 01:14:41.767
-Okay?
-Yeah.

01:14:41.898 --> 01:14:44.778
Babe, come meet Renee!

01:14:44.943 --> 01:14:45.993
Hi.

01:14:46.444 --> 01:14:48.664
It's so nice to finally meet you!

01:14:48.738 --> 01:14:51.448
Renee, this is Amanda. She's my girlfriend.

01:14:51.533 --> 01:14:54.083
She's down from New York
for the show on Friday.

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.580
Yeah. Jamie talks about you all the time.

01:14:56.663 --> 01:14:58.463
He's so proud of you.

01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:01.840
And I can't wait for the event on Friday.
It's going to be amazing.

01:15:03.628 --> 01:15:05.878
Are you looking forward to it? Are...

01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:10.720
Well, anyway, it's nice to finally meet you,

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:13.720
and I can't wait for Friday, and...

01:15:13.763 --> 01:15:14.763
And we've got to catch up.

01:16:34.302 --> 01:16:36.182
-It's like it happened overnight, you know?
-Yeah, yeah.

01:16:36.388 --> 01:16:38.768
We've had this office
for a couple months now.

01:16:39.933 --> 01:16:43.693
In this room we put some of the letters
from, you know, our followers.

01:16:43.728 --> 01:16:44.728
Hey, Renee.

01:16:44.813 --> 01:16:45.813
-Hey.
-Hey, babe.

01:16:45.897 --> 01:16:46.897
That's cool.

01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:48.690
They write to us, you know.
They just want to have a voice.

01:16:48.733 --> 01:16:49.733
Yeah.

01:16:49.818 --> 01:16:52.648
Come on in.
These people just want someone to talk to,

01:16:53.154 --> 01:16:54.994
someone to hear them.

01:16:55.073 --> 01:16:56.073
Yeah.

01:16:56.116 --> 01:16:57.486
And they feel safe with you.

01:16:57.575 --> 01:16:59.535
So just click on the messages.

01:17:01.204 --> 01:17:03.294
<i>-AndvoilÃ .
-Yeah.</i>

01:17:03.373 --> 01:17:05.923
-You okay?
-Yeah, yeah.

01:17:06.668 --> 01:17:08.708
-Be right across the hall.
-All right.

01:17:14.759 --> 01:17:18.599
<i>I can't do life anymore. I just want to die.</i>

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.520
<i>Everything's so messed up.</i>

01:17:21.474 --> 01:17:23.734
I don't have friends like you.

01:17:26.021 --> 01:17:28.021
Why are you so special?

01:17:29.441 --> 01:17:34.241
I'm writing this 'cause
nobody knows about the scars on my chest.

01:17:36.656 --> 01:17:38.616
Who am I supposed to tell?

01:17:42.245 --> 01:17:44.705
<i>Hi. My...</i>

01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:48.130
When I was 12, my dad molested me.

01:17:48.209 --> 01:17:49.789
Okay.

01:18:01.723 --> 01:18:05.393
It's the only time that I agree.
I know. It was so embarrassing.

01:18:05.435 --> 01:18:07.345
You know what,
would you at least put on your robe

01:18:07.395 --> 01:18:09.105
before you run for the paper every Tuesday?

01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:10.609
-Yes. Yes.
-Yes?

01:18:22.243 --> 01:18:24.253
Then the band will play
and I'll introduce you.

01:18:24.329 --> 01:18:27.329
And then you speak.
Have you written something up?

01:18:27.957 --> 01:18:29.957
-About what?
-Your story.

01:18:32.212 --> 01:18:35.092
It's kind of a personal story. Don't you think?

01:18:39.427 --> 01:18:42.427
Hey, guys, would you mind helping me
put the T-shirts in the van?

01:18:44.891 --> 01:18:46.641
You got a sec?

01:18:49.354 --> 01:18:51.234
What's going on?

01:18:54.275 --> 01:18:57.105
What... Why did you write this?

01:18:58.113 --> 01:18:59.413
For you.

01:19:01.908 --> 01:19:06.578
For me? Really? How... All this is for me?

01:19:07.247 --> 01:19:08.577
Yeah.

01:19:09.833 --> 01:19:11.923
I'm sitting at the airport

01:19:14.754 --> 01:19:16.884
and I can't stop thinking about you.

01:19:17.757 --> 01:19:19.837
You and these five days.

01:19:20.176 --> 01:19:24.886
I just started writing and writing,
and my heart poured out and it was beautiful.

01:19:24.931 --> 01:19:26.771
And it was about you.

01:19:27.976 --> 01:19:34.016
So then why didn't you just send it to me?

01:19:34.899 --> 01:19:38.069
Because I thought about Zeke,

01:19:38.111 --> 01:19:40.321
and I thought about all the people,

01:19:41.948 --> 01:19:44.368
all the people
who were in similar circumstances

01:19:44.409 --> 01:19:50.209
and I wanted people to know
that recovery is possible.

01:19:54.544 --> 01:19:58.634
What if I'm not recovered?

01:20:00.717 --> 01:20:02.717
What are you talking about?

01:20:04.763 --> 01:20:05.973
Talk to me. This is...

01:20:06.056 --> 01:20:07.846
This is me, all right, you know?

01:20:07.891 --> 01:20:09.731
Put all this aside.

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:12.810
Do you need to go back to rehab?

01:20:15.231 --> 01:20:18.071
No. I'm fine.

01:20:18.109 --> 01:20:19.109
Renee, we can pay for it.

01:20:19.194 --> 01:20:21.534
I'm fine.

01:20:23.323 --> 01:20:27.913
-I just am nervous. Just nervous.
-Yeah.

01:20:31.748 --> 01:20:34.748
All right. I'm here if you need me.

01:22:14.559 --> 01:22:17.519
-Hey! Hey.
-Hey!

01:22:17.562 --> 01:22:18.902
How are you feeling?

01:22:20.023 --> 01:22:21.523
I just wanted to see you
and talk about some...

01:22:21.566 --> 01:22:23.776
It's a bit of a mess. Just hang on a sec.

01:22:23.860 --> 01:22:27.450
I'm just going to clean up.
I've been... Had the... Find some...

01:22:28.156 --> 01:22:29.946
So you got fired, huh?

01:22:30.033 --> 01:22:31.623
-What's that, sorry?
-You just got fired

01:22:31.701 --> 01:22:34.621
and now you have to sell your loft
because of me.

01:22:34.704 --> 01:22:37.084
No, no. It's just... It's...

01:22:37.123 --> 01:22:39.583
It's too big anyway for me.

01:22:39.668 --> 01:22:43.338
I'm just... No, I've got, you know,
irons in the fire...

01:22:44.130 --> 01:22:45.670
What's wrong with you?

01:22:45.715 --> 01:22:47.125
I'm just excited, you know?

01:22:47.217 --> 01:22:51.547
I've got a lot of stuff going on at the moment.
It's really a busy time for me.

01:22:51.638 --> 01:22:52.678
Yeah.

01:22:53.223 --> 01:22:54.643
Look what I got.

01:22:55.183 --> 01:22:56.273
Your watch.

01:22:56.726 --> 01:22:58.306
-And it... Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:22:58.395 --> 01:22:59.395
All right.

01:22:59.437 --> 01:23:02.147
Well, listen, I'm so sorry I couldn't come,

01:23:02.232 --> 01:23:06.952
and, you know, have a chance to...

01:23:07.028 --> 01:23:10.908
To come get you out, meet you out of there.

01:23:11.991 --> 01:23:17.411
Listen, I'm sick.
So maybe don't catch germs from that.

01:23:18.039 --> 01:23:22.169
So what did you want to talk to me about?
What's the trouble?

01:23:34.431 --> 01:23:39.601
I wanted to know how you stayed sober
for so... Such a long time.

01:23:46.651 --> 01:23:49.491
-You just take it one day at a time, you know?
-Yeah?

01:23:49.571 --> 01:23:52.991
Easy, easy does it is what we...

01:23:56.077 --> 01:23:58.537
You know, you have to wind this or else...

01:23:59.330 --> 01:24:01.420
I told you, you have to wind it.

01:24:03.793 --> 01:24:06.763
You forgot to hide a bottle over there, buddy.

01:24:14.554 --> 01:24:16.264
I lost the band.

01:24:19.601 --> 01:24:24.151
I'm eating crap. I lost the band.
I'm not doing great, okay?

01:24:24.230 --> 01:24:26.070
It's been a tough time.

01:24:39.913 --> 01:24:41.123
Okay.

01:24:41.206 --> 01:24:43.536
I don't have anybody, okay?

01:24:44.376 --> 01:24:45.876
I don't either.

01:24:48.296 --> 01:24:49.296
Renee, come on!

01:24:54.469 --> 01:24:56.099
Renee!

01:25:11.611 --> 01:25:13.571
-Hey! Have you guys seen Renee?
-Hey!

01:25:13.655 --> 01:25:14.695
-No.
-No.

01:25:14.739 --> 01:25:16.199
I've been trying to get a hold of her all day.

01:25:16.241 --> 01:25:17.281
Why, did something happen?

01:25:17.909 --> 01:25:20.699
You know, it's nothing.
She just wasn't herself yesterday.

01:25:20.745 --> 01:25:23.035
-Did she say anything?
-No.

01:25:23.081 --> 01:25:26.001
I'm going to call her.
I'm sure it's fine. I'm going to call her.

01:26:08.418 --> 01:26:11.758
Hey! My truck! What the hell?

01:26:13.631 --> 01:26:15.341
You have a kid?

01:26:16.301 --> 01:26:17.721
Boy or girl?

01:26:18.845 --> 01:26:22.555
-Boy or girl?
-A little girl. A girl.

01:26:51.961 --> 01:26:53.631
Oh, God!

01:26:55.757 --> 01:26:57.377
Look who it is! Yohe!

01:26:58.343 --> 01:27:02.893
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Check this out, check this out!

01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:06.770
This is my new favorite shirt.
I love wearing this thing.

01:27:07.477 --> 01:27:09.057
So does that mean that you're...

01:27:09.104 --> 01:27:12.984
'Cause you're wearing the shirt,
you're sober 'cause...

01:27:13.066 --> 01:27:15.936
Me? No, I mean,
I don't like getting high in your shirt.

01:27:16.027 --> 01:27:19.407
So there's some internal conflict going on.

01:27:19.447 --> 01:27:23.577
Man. You! You sobriety celebrity you!

01:27:23.618 --> 01:27:25.748
Dude, I don't want to talk about this.

01:27:26.121 --> 01:27:28.371
Aren't you supposed to be
at that party right now?

01:27:28.415 --> 01:27:31.665
I'm the last person who should be
telling anyone how to live their lives.

01:27:32.210 --> 01:27:34.920
I was in rehab for six months.

01:27:36.047 --> 01:27:39.927
I am exactly the... I'm exactly the same.

01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:44.890
The thing that people love about you
and your story is that it's honest.

01:27:45.682 --> 01:27:49.272
You're sad. Shit happens.

01:27:50.395 --> 01:27:52.555
You're trying, okay?

01:27:52.647 --> 01:27:54.897
Even if it's just a little bit.

01:27:55.775 --> 01:27:57.855
Where else you got to go tonight?

01:28:01.614 --> 01:28:05.124
<i>I wrote this story for Renee because</i>

01:28:07.704 --> 01:28:10.754
<i>I wanted to believe in the happily ever after.</i>

01:28:10.832 --> 01:28:13.212
<i>Now, her story isn't unique,</i>

01:28:13.293 --> 01:28:15.503
<i>but she is.</i>

01:28:17.589 --> 01:28:21.719
<i>The way she speaks the truth.</i>

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:24.390
<i>The way she sees the world.</i>

01:28:26.389 --> 01:28:29.349
<i>And I pray that never changes.</i>

01:28:30.101 --> 01:28:33.731
<i>Now, Renee was
supposed to be here tonight.</i>

01:28:34.689 --> 01:28:36.729
<i>But she couldn't make it.</i>

01:28:37.359 --> 01:28:41.739
<i>But in the spirit of Renee,</i>

01:28:41.988 --> 01:28:45.738
<i>we should open it up to you out there.</i>

01:28:46.534 --> 01:28:49.414
<i>Now, we've got some friends who are
going to be bringing microphones around.</i>

01:28:49.496 --> 01:28:54.536
<i>They're going to bring them down the aisles.
Let's stand up and tell our story.</i>

01:29:00.006 --> 01:29:01.586
<i>Go ahead.</i>

01:29:04.135 --> 01:29:08.095
<i>The first time I ever thought about suicide</i>

01:29:08.348 --> 01:29:12.558
<i>was around the same time
I started pulling my hair.</i>

01:29:12.769 --> 01:29:16.769
<i>Two weeks ago,
I did a search for ways to end it</i>

01:29:16.856 --> 01:29:21.236
<i>and I found the To Write Love site.</i>

01:29:21.736 --> 01:29:23.406
<i>I read Renee's story.</i>

01:29:24.656 --> 01:29:28.656
<i>I wasn't used to hearing
other people hurting.</i>

01:29:29.244 --> 01:29:32.504
<i>Her story helped me find hope.</i>

01:29:34.582 --> 01:29:36.042
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:29:39.587 --> 01:29:41.127
<i>Anybody else?</i>

01:29:42.048 --> 01:29:43.088
<i>Hi.</i>

01:29:44.509 --> 01:29:45.969
<i>Hello.</i>

01:29:47.387 --> 01:29:48.757
<i>That was...</i>

01:29:49.556 --> 01:29:51.136
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:29:52.308 --> 01:29:55.768
<i>I'm not sure what to say,
but my friends are here</i>

01:29:57.856 --> 01:30:01.526
<i>and I know they're worried about me.</i>

01:30:03.194 --> 01:30:07.494
<i>They think I'm better, and I'm not.</i>

01:30:08.408 --> 01:30:12.368
<i>But I think that's okay,</i>

01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:15.710
<i>'cause I have them.</i>

01:30:24.799 --> 01:30:26.929
<i>Secrets make you sick.</i>

01:30:27.719 --> 01:30:33.139
<i>Somebody that I love told me that
and it's true.</i>

01:30:36.686 --> 01:30:40.396
<i>'Cause when I finally asked for help, I got it.</i>

01:30:42.567 --> 01:30:47.527
<i>And when my friend asked me for help,
I just...</i>

01:30:51.743 --> 01:30:54.413
<i>I didn't give it to him.</i>

01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:02.300
<i>I think what this whole thing is about</i>

01:31:06.549 --> 01:31:08.549
<i>is what I'm going to go do</i>

01:31:12.972 --> 01:31:15.522
<i>right now. So thanks.</i>

01:31:17.727 --> 01:31:19.397
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:31:24.442 --> 01:31:25.742
<i>Anybody else?</i>

01:31:34.244 --> 01:31:35.664
McKenna?

01:32:20.832 --> 01:32:23.632
Clever. Clever.

01:32:24.002 --> 01:32:26.712
Conrad said I should ask you about that.

01:32:33.678 --> 01:32:35.218
My father put me in prison.

01:32:37.807 --> 01:32:42.937
Well, selling a shitload of cocaine
put me in prison,

01:32:44.105 --> 01:32:46.145
but my father turned me in.

01:32:48.443 --> 01:32:51.243
I think he knew
it was the only way I'd get clean.

01:32:55.241 --> 01:32:58.451
And I hated him for it, I hated him for it.

01:32:59.788 --> 01:33:02.078
And I told him in a letter.

01:33:04.042 --> 01:33:07.212
And in return, he sends me this.

01:33:10.048 --> 01:33:12.338
I never knew why he didn't drink,

01:33:14.552 --> 01:33:17.432
and, well, it turns out, "Like father, like son."

01:33:18.890 --> 01:33:20.850
He died while I was in there.

01:33:25.063 --> 01:33:28.613
So "James Terrance McKenna."

01:33:32.028 --> 01:33:35.028
So I guess
that's all your questions answered.

01:33:37.909 --> 01:33:39.079
I'm sorry.

01:33:39.703 --> 01:33:42.913
-It's all right. It was a while ago.
-No.

01:33:42.956 --> 01:33:45.706
I'm sorry I left you.

01:33:51.214 --> 01:33:52.884
I called Conrad.

01:33:53.883 --> 01:33:55.143
You did?

01:33:55.885 --> 01:34:00.215
Yep. Asked him if he had any room at the inn.

01:34:02.017 --> 01:34:05.147
I told him I'd prefer to get sober
in an all-girls facility.

01:34:08.273 --> 01:34:11.033
<i>We all wake to the human condition.</i>

01:34:11.067 --> 01:34:14.487
<i>We wake to mystery and beauty,</i>

01:34:14.571 --> 01:34:17.701
<i>but also to tragedy and loss.</i>

01:34:17.741 --> 01:34:20.991
<i>Millions of people know that pain is very real.</i>

01:34:22.412 --> 01:34:25.372
<i>We also know that hope is real.</i>

01:34:25.457 --> 01:34:30.127
<i>When Renee came to us,
we became her hospital, her church.</i>

01:34:30.211 --> 01:34:33.091
<i>Coming alive to meet her needs,</i>

01:34:33.173 --> 01:34:35.553
<i>to write love on her arms.</i>

01:34:35.592 --> 01:34:37.432
<i>Rescue is possible.</i>

01:34:37.761 --> 01:34:39.931
<i>God is still in the business of redemption.</i>

01:34:41.681 --> 01:34:45.231
<i>The first step to recovery
is the hardest to take.</i>

01:34:45.977 --> 01:34:47.727
<i>But it's worth it.</i>

01:34:48.521 --> 01:34:51.071
<i>Life is worth fighting for.</i>

01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:09.960
Hi, I'm Jamie Tworkowski,
founder of To Write Love on Her Arms.

01:35:10.043 --> 01:35:11.383
Millions of people around the world

01:35:11.461 --> 01:35:15.221
struggle with depression, addiction,
self-injury and suicide.

01:35:15.298 --> 01:35:17.378
There's a stigma that
if you struggle with these things,

01:35:17.467 --> 01:35:19.387
you're not supposed to talk about it.

01:35:19.427 --> 01:35:22.557
But I'm here on behalf of people
literally choosing to stay alive

01:35:22.597 --> 01:35:25.057
and choosing to believe that life can change.

01:35:25.141 --> 01:35:27.941
If you're struggling, or if there's
someone you're concerned about,

01:35:28.019 --> 01:35:29.729
please know you're not alone.

01:35:29.813 --> 01:35:32.903
It's okay to be honest
and it's okay to ask for help.

01:35:32.982 --> 01:35:37.112
You are living a story, and it's our hope that
you will never give up on that story.

01:35:38.279 --> 01:35:40.279
To Write Love on Her Arms still exists today.

01:35:40.365 --> 01:35:42.905
We respond to every single message
that comes in,

01:35:42.951 --> 01:35:45.451
and there are more ways than ever
to get involved.

01:36:03.722 --> 01:36:05.722
<i>I called you from the hospital</i>

01:36:05.765 --> 01:36:08.135
<i>You didn't pick up the phone</i>

01:36:08.226 --> 01:36:11.726
<i>I was left alone
with the crazy fishes</i>

01:36:11.771 --> 01:36:14.361
<i>Swimmin' in their senseless circle</i>

01:36:14.399 --> 01:36:16.399
<i>All of us together</i>

01:36:16.484 --> 01:36:20.074
<i>Smashing our faces in the glass</i>

01:36:20.113 --> 01:36:24.743
<i>This repetition's definition
could be insanity</i>

01:36:24.784 --> 01:36:27.584
<i>But flip a switch
and check the sky as I go</i>

01:36:27.662 --> 01:36:31.712
<i>Just gotta keep trying</i>

01:36:31.791 --> 01:36:35.461
<i>Had to keep trying</i>

01:36:37.213 --> 01:36:41.383
<i>I had said
that I'd be better</i>

01:36:41.426 --> 01:36:44.506
<i>Told you
I'd never fall again</i>

01:36:45.555 --> 01:36:50.225
<i>Countless times
and you believed me</i>

01:36:50.268 --> 01:36:53.898
<i>But I let you down again</i>

01:36:53.938 --> 01:36:58.568
<i>I'm not asking you to answer</i>

01:36:58.651 --> 01:37:01.361
<i>I can tell this is the end</i>

01:37:01.404 --> 01:37:07.124
<i>So I'm goin' to leave you at the tone</i>

01:37:14.876 --> 01:37:19.046
<i>I know that I won't spend
my whole life in a cell</i>

01:37:19.130 --> 01:37:23.090
<i>I will keep fighting
and so be righting myself</i>

01:37:23.176 --> 01:37:27.386
<i>One foot right in front
of the other as they say</i>

01:37:27.472 --> 01:37:29.222
<i>Even when it's dismal</i>

01:37:29.265 --> 01:37:31.555
<i>I'm guaranteed change</i>

01:37:31.643 --> 01:37:35.733
<i>I had said that I'd be better</i>

01:37:35.772 --> 01:37:39.862
<i>Told you I'd never fall again</i>

01:37:39.901 --> 01:37:44.491

01:37:44.572 --> 01:37:48.122

01:37:55.542 --> 01:38:01.342
<i>So I'm goin' to leave you at the tone</i>

01:38:01.381 --> 01:38:03.131
<i>Goin' to leave you</i>

01:38:03.216 --> 01:38:05.716
