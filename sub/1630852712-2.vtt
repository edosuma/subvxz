WEBVTT

00:39.520 --> 00:41.520
CHATTER

00:43.920 --> 00:46.280
CHURCH BELLS RING

00:57.440 --> 01:01.120
So, are we friends again?

01:01.120 --> 01:03.680
Bella?
Yes?

01:03.680 --> 01:05.560
I said, "Are we friends again?"

01:05.560 --> 01:07.960
Yes.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.960
So...? Say it.

01:13.440 --> 01:16.760
We're friends again.
Good.

01:16.760 --> 01:19.040
You know I can't bear it
when I'm in bad odour with you.

01:24.240 --> 01:25.400
Must you?

01:35.240 --> 01:37.240
Bellakins.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.040
It was nice, wasn't it?

01:41.040 --> 01:43.640
Yes.

01:43.640 --> 01:47.120
Then why do you look like
such a wet weekend?

01:47.120 --> 01:49.640
I have a lot on my mind.

01:49.640 --> 01:52.560
Don't tell me.
I know you hate talking about money.

01:52.560 --> 01:54.120
I don't hate talking about it,

01:54.120 --> 01:57.000
I hate all the unpleasantness that
comes with not having enough of it!

01:59.960 --> 02:03.440
Of course, there is an easy solution
to all of this, sweetheart.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.840
No. Cecil, there is nothing easy

02:05.840 --> 02:08.120
about asking my father
for more money.

02:08.120 --> 02:09.480
There you go again.

02:09.480 --> 02:12.400
He's been generous.
He's been more than generous to us.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.680
Please!

02:13.680 --> 02:16.480
He's paid out precisely what was
agreed in our marriage settlement.

02:16.480 --> 02:19.120
Not a penny more or less.
None of which has come to us.

02:19.120 --> 02:22.240
Don't start that! You can't blame me
for blasted death duties!

02:22.240 --> 02:24.240
The house. The estate. Everything.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.200
It will all come
to Lucian in the end.

02:26.200 --> 02:29.280
Well, should he ever want to go
back.  Well, whose fault is that?

02:31.320 --> 02:34.800
Look, your father...
you're all he's got.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.240
He only wants you to be happy.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.920
He doesn't begrudge you a brass
farthing you spend on this place.

02:38.920 --> 02:41.160
I can't keep going to him
cap in hand!

02:41.160 --> 02:44.400
That is utter foolishness!
He has money coming out of his ears!

02:44.400 --> 02:47.920
What's foolish about not wanting
to be indebted to someone?

02:47.920 --> 02:49.840
You already are indebted!

02:49.840 --> 02:52.800
He's paid for every cushion and
candlestick in this infernal place!

02:52.800 --> 02:55.320
And I have promised to pay him back.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.520
He's not expecting
to see a penny of it.

02:57.520 --> 02:59.760
Which is why I'm determined
that he will.

03:00.920 --> 03:03.120
Swallow your damn pride, Bella.

03:28.920 --> 03:32.600
Namaste.
I'm sorry?

03:32.600 --> 03:35.560
Namaste. Did I say it wrong?

03:35.560 --> 03:38.440
No. No, please. Not at all.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.880
It's just the first word I've heard
spoken in Hindi in quite a time.

03:43.880 --> 03:48.000
Well, it's the first and the last.
That's all he taught me.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.840
And who is he? If I might enquire.
The Maharaja of Jaipur's brother.

03:53.920 --> 03:59.240
You've been to Jaipur?
Hell, no. He came to see my show.

03:59.240 --> 04:02.240
In America?
In Paris!

04:02.240 --> 04:05.520
I haven't been home since the war.
Neither have I.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.640
And how do you find Italy?

04:11.640 --> 04:14.800
You mean, how does Italy find me?

04:17.200 --> 04:20.080
Italy would like to arrest me
on the spot.

04:20.080 --> 04:23.760
They haven't got around
to passing a law against me.

04:23.760 --> 04:28.240
I have a feeling they soon might.
It was him who taught me.

04:28.240 --> 04:31.520
In case you're wondering.
The Maharaja's brother?

04:33.880 --> 04:37.240
He offered me a pearl
as big as a duck egg.

04:37.240 --> 04:38.840
I wasn't able to oblige him.

04:38.840 --> 04:42.240
So he had to settle for giving me
yoga lessons instead.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.200
That is very honourable of you.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.520
You wanna join me, honey?

04:48.520 --> 04:53.240
Er, it's not really my thing.
Ah, no. You'll catch on soon enough.

04:53.240 --> 04:55.040
Let's go.

04:55.040 --> 04:58.120
Ah, OK.
Shoes. Take your shoes off.

05:00.880 --> 05:05.280
Bring your arms above your head
and just lean back a little.

05:05.280 --> 05:08.840
What's this, then, callisthenics?

05:08.840 --> 05:11.040
It's yoga, you fool.

05:13.040 --> 05:16.520
Room for a couple of little ones?
The more, the merrier!

05:16.520 --> 05:20.600
Rose?
Rose! Where are you?

05:20.600 --> 05:22.400
I'd better not.

05:24.200 --> 05:27.440
I'll be here every morning
if you change your mind.

05:30.840 --> 05:34.400
Here we are. The sooner we can
get this place ready, the better.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.160
And one less thing to worry about.
Oh.

05:37.160 --> 05:40.360
Are the Drummond-Wards leaving?
Oh, goodness, no.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.480
but they've asked to change rooms
for some reason.

05:42.480 --> 05:43.800
I'm not quite sure why.

05:43.800 --> 05:47.200
I've never seen a room quite
so beautiful, Mrs Ainsworth.

05:47.200 --> 05:51.600
Oh, thank you, Constance. I do hope
the Wingfields agree with you.

05:52.720 --> 05:58.320
Oh, ciao, Paola. Ho chiesto
a Constance di aiutarti.

05:58.320 --> 06:00.920
Molte grazie, Mrs Ainsworth.

06:00.920 --> 06:05.520
Paola doesn't speak any English.
But perhaps she understands some.

06:05.520 --> 06:06.800
You never know.

06:10.960 --> 06:14.560
You never know.
You do speak English.

06:14.560 --> 06:16.640
A little.

06:16.640 --> 06:19.920
Signor Lucian...
Master Ainsworth?

06:19.920 --> 06:23.280
He give me... lezioni.
Lessons.

06:23.280 --> 06:25.880
Lessons.
Lessons. Si, English lessons.

06:25.880 --> 06:28.200
I have lessons too.

06:29.920 --> 06:33.400
Signor Lucian?
Si!

06:41.320 --> 06:44.400
LAUGHTER AND CHATTER

06:47.680 --> 06:50.840
I think I'd better just go.
You know...

06:50.840 --> 06:53.000
Yes. Of course.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.080
You look flushed.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.720
I've just been having a yoga lesson.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.280
Yoga.

07:03.280 --> 07:05.200
Yes, it's some sort
of stationary gymnastics.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.880
Apparently, the Indians
have been at it for centuries.

07:07.880 --> 07:10.040
Mr Sengupta has been teaching you?

07:11.280 --> 07:14.400
Er, no, Mrs Turner, actually.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.240
Oh, she is a woman of many talents.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.640
Apparently so.

07:22.560 --> 07:25.880
If I may be so bold, er,
I was thinking...

07:25.880 --> 07:30.120
I was hoping, actually, um...
with your permission of course,

07:30.120 --> 07:33.400
I was hoping that Rose
might wish to accompany me

07:33.400 --> 07:35.160
for a look around town.

07:35.160 --> 07:37.280
I thought we might
go to the beach afterwards,

07:37.280 --> 07:39.560
have a little painting lesson.

07:39.560 --> 07:43.520
Is this something you've discussed?
No, Mama.

07:47.120 --> 07:49.520
You'd be more than welcome
to join us, if you wish.

07:49.520 --> 07:50.920
I would insist upon it.

07:53.080 --> 07:55.280
Won't it be ridiculously hot?

07:57.360 --> 07:59.520
There's always quite
a pleasant breeze by the sea.

07:59.520 --> 08:00.920
And there's plenty of shade.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.120
You'll be wasting your efforts
on Rose, I'm afraid.

08:05.120 --> 08:07.600
She's devoid of artistic talent.

08:13.320 --> 08:17.200
You always say I should take every
opportunity to improve myself, Mama.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.040
Very well.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.360
Father?

08:50.360 --> 08:54.520
You realise this nonsense will have
to stop sooner or later, don't you?

08:54.520 --> 08:55.960
Nonsense?

08:55.960 --> 09:00.880
This. It isn't worth anything,
any of it.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.440
I have it on good authority.

09:02.440 --> 09:05.680
Well, it's worth something to me.

09:07.800 --> 09:12.000
Um, I thought I might take
Miss Drummond-Ward

09:12.000 --> 09:14.320
for a painting lesson.
At the beach.

09:14.320 --> 09:15.600
Oh?

09:17.040 --> 09:19.520
I thought you'd be pleased.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.800
Well, it's something, I suppose.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.040
Well, don't keep the lady waiting!

09:38.720 --> 09:40.720
What are you putting
in the sandwiches, Betty?

09:40.720 --> 09:44.560
La lingu... La...
Oh, hang on a minute.

09:44.560 --> 09:49.760
Mrs Ainsworth wrote it down for me.
La "ling-ewer"...

09:49.760 --> 09:52.120
Lingua.
Thank you.

09:52.120 --> 09:55.800
La lingua di vitello.

09:55.800 --> 09:58.440
Hmm.
And what's that when it's at home?

09:58.440 --> 10:00.920
Veal tongue. It's a local delicacy.

10:03.920 --> 10:07.640
Are you excited? About the beach.
I'm only there to fetch and carry.

10:07.640 --> 10:12.200
Oh, you might get to dip a toe in.
Eggs.

10:12.200 --> 10:16.160
I'm sure Mrs Drummond-Ward
will keep me far too busy.

10:16.160 --> 10:17.960
Proper little dragon, that one.
Betty!

10:17.960 --> 10:20.560
What? She is.

10:20.560 --> 10:23.480
The way she bullies
that poor little girl...

10:24.680 --> 10:25.920
Thank you.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.920
Rose is very beautiful.
Yes, well. That's as may be.

10:36.920 --> 10:40.520
Silly little ninny.
Wouldn't say boo to a goose.

10:40.520 --> 10:45.720
Still, I should hold me tongue.
SHE LAUGHS

10:45.720 --> 10:49.080
The tongue.
No pun intended, Conny.

10:50.600 --> 10:55.280
Ma'am.
LAUGHTER

10:59.040 --> 11:02.760
Rose will be the boss of us all
before too long.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.160
Rose will be?

11:05.160 --> 11:07.280
Haven't you worked it out?

11:07.280 --> 11:10.360
Her and master Lucian.
They're in love?

11:10.360 --> 11:14.160
Oh! Plenty of time to talk about
love once they're married.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.240
It's all agreed, then.

11:16.240 --> 11:21.440
No. But it will be.
Before the summer's over.

11:22.440 --> 11:26.000
At least, if Mr Ainsworth's
got anything to do with it.

11:31.880 --> 11:33.880
BUSY CHATTER

12:11.360 --> 12:16.240
Telephone?
No, no, no telefono, no.

12:20.400 --> 12:23.400
Excuse me, a telefono?

12:30.800 --> 12:34.040
It's like bloody Bombay.
Signore.

12:35.960 --> 12:38.560
You require some assistenza?

12:38.560 --> 12:41.040
Yes, I was hoping
to find a telephone.

12:41.040 --> 12:45.280
Telephone. Hey, look.
We are poor Italians here.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.560
We marvel at you English
and your inventions.

12:47.560 --> 12:50.880
Try telling that to Marconi.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.720
Scusi, Signore.

12:55.920 --> 12:58.680
Please.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.160
This way, sir.

13:11.720 --> 13:14.640
Ah, Mussolini.
The great man himself.

13:14.640 --> 13:17.920
The great man indeed.

13:17.920 --> 13:20.280
I don't suppose
you'd lend him to us?

13:20.280 --> 13:22.640
Crack some English heads together.

13:25.680 --> 13:28.480
Please.
Perhaps not.

13:34.760 --> 13:37.400
As long as you need.

13:37.400 --> 13:41.040
Ah,
I see you've been pulling my leg.

13:42.600 --> 13:47.000
I'm sorry?
Never mind. I will pay.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.280
Absolutely not!
No, no, no. I insist.

13:49.280 --> 13:54.600
And I insist, too.
Vincenzo Danioni at your service.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.920
Ah. Cecil Ainsworth. At yours.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.600
Please.

14:12.520 --> 14:15.320
PHONE RINGS OUT
Operator!

14:15.320 --> 14:18.040
'Buongiorno Signore.
Con chi desidera parlare?'

14:18.040 --> 14:20.520
The centralino.
'D'accordo.'

14:20.520 --> 14:22.640
RAIN POURS,
DOG BARKS

14:22.640 --> 14:24.400
THUNDER RUMBLES

14:28.000 --> 14:30.160
Your brother, sir.

14:33.560 --> 14:34.800
Cecil?

14:34.800 --> 14:36.920
'Is that you?'
It's me!

14:36.920 --> 14:38.400
'All the way from Italy.'

14:38.400 --> 14:42.200
'Yes, Edmund.
All the way from Italy.'

14:42.200 --> 14:44.400
'Well, I'll be damned.'
How is the old place?

14:44.400 --> 14:45.880
'Well, you know.'

14:45.880 --> 14:48.320
Still creaking under the strain
a little.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.960
And Margot?

14:51.600 --> 14:53.400
Happiest when she's in the saddle.

14:53.400 --> 14:56.680
Now, you got my telegram, I take it.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.200
Right here in front of me, old boy.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.320
'Well, I'll get
straight to the point, then.'

15:00.320 --> 15:01.560
I wish you would.

15:01.560 --> 15:04.440
Do you still have
Grand-papa's Rubens?

15:04.440 --> 15:08.520
Naked wench, mirror,
west wing sitting room?

15:08.520 --> 15:09.760
'The very same.'

15:09.760 --> 15:13.480
'Still gathering dust with the
ancestors, the last time I looked.'

15:13.480 --> 15:17.520
Well, then. Crate it up and
send it over. There's a good fellow.

15:17.520 --> 15:21.000
And why exactly would
I want to do a thing like that?

15:22.560 --> 15:24.960
Because I may know someone
who wants to buy it.

15:24.960 --> 15:26.760
'For more than it would cost
to send?'

15:26.760 --> 15:30.920
Much more. Enough to keep the tax
man off your back for a year or two.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.760
'Only if it is a Rubens.

15:32.760 --> 15:36.280
'And as you well know, it's most
likely nothing of the sort.'

15:36.280 --> 15:37.720
We'll see about that.

15:37.720 --> 15:40.440
'Besides which, we've only got
the old boy's word for it.'

15:40.440 --> 15:43.200
Not for very much longer, I hope.

15:59.560 --> 16:01.600
Will the Epson suite be ready,
darling?

16:01.600 --> 16:04.760
Yes.
What time do the Wingfields arrive?

16:04.760 --> 16:07.480
Oh, any time.
Oh, what's that?

16:07.480 --> 16:11.040
Lucian.
Lady Latchmere!

16:11.040 --> 16:14.200
Can my son tempt you
to go on his beach expedition?

16:14.200 --> 16:17.960
Gracious, no. I can't abide sand.
Oh.

16:17.960 --> 16:20.760
Perhaps a trip to church on Sunday
might suit us both a little better.

16:20.760 --> 16:23.960
To church? In Italy?
I'm sorry, I assumed...

16:23.960 --> 16:26.760
No, no. Religion
is my greatest consolation,

16:26.760 --> 16:29.720
but only the right sort.
Forgive me.

16:29.720 --> 16:33.800
All that smoke and popery.
Any port in a storm, I always say.

16:33.800 --> 16:37.080
Oh, Mrs Turner.
Are you a regular churchgoer?

16:37.080 --> 16:38.800
Nothing about me is regular, honey.

16:38.800 --> 16:43.520
But a spot of confession
is always good for the soul. Right?

16:43.520 --> 16:46.520
UPBEAT JAZZ PLAYS

16:53.000 --> 16:54.920
HORN TOOTS

16:59.520 --> 17:02.720
That's him. That's...
That's Pelham Wingfield.

17:02.720 --> 17:06.600
Who's Pelham Wingfield?
One of the Suffolk Wingfields?

17:06.600 --> 17:10.200
I haven't a clue. I only know he's
a tennis player and a terrific one.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.560
He nearly won the Davis Cup
last year.  Hmm.

17:12.560 --> 17:14.520
I'll have to take
your word for that.

17:14.520 --> 17:18.280
Rose, is that what you're wearing?
Well, I thought so.

17:18.280 --> 17:21.080
I'm sure we can wait five minutes
while you go and change.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.840
POLITE CHATTER

17:33.640 --> 17:36.320
Please. How was your journey?
Very pleasant.

17:36.320 --> 17:39.760
Hot, I imagine. And long.
And sticky.

17:39.760 --> 17:42.840
Yes. Oh, Mrs Wingfield, your key.
Thank you.

17:42.840 --> 17:46.920
If I might say, it's such
a pleasure to have a tennis champion

17:46.920 --> 17:50.560
staying in the house.
My son's an absolute fanatic.

17:50.560 --> 17:52.280
It's my pleasure, really.
Oh, well...

17:52.280 --> 17:55.040
He is from the north of Italy.
Will you excuse me one minute?

17:55.040 --> 17:57.800
Yes. Oh, do you mind if I...
Oh, yes, of course.

17:57.800 --> 18:01.640
The winning racket. I'm sorry.
Thank you so much.

18:01.640 --> 18:03.240
Well...

18:03.240 --> 18:06.080
Which part of the country exactly?
Oh, listen.

18:06.080 --> 18:09.160
It's really not important
where he's coming from,

18:09.160 --> 18:12.720
but where he's going.
Oh, Cecil?

18:12.720 --> 18:17.960
Oh. Here you are, darling.
This is Signor Danioni.

18:17.960 --> 18:22.520
It is my honour, Signora Ainsworth.

18:22.520 --> 18:25.400
Forgive me. Could I borrow
my husband for a moment?

18:25.400 --> 18:27.240
Sure. Please.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.800
Scusi.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.480
What is he doing here?
What?

18:33.480 --> 18:35.160
Well,
he's really been most obliging.

18:35.160 --> 18:36.520
I thought the least we could do

18:36.520 --> 18:39.320
was offer him some hospitality
in return.  Hospitality?

18:39.320 --> 18:42.200
You know, tea. A sandwich or two.
A bit of Betty's cake.

18:42.200 --> 18:45.000
Let him think
he's an Englishman for an afternoon.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.040
Has he asked you for anything?

18:47.040 --> 18:49.160
No, not a sausage.
Why are you whispering?

18:49.160 --> 18:53.720
Darling, he let me telephone home
entirely free of charge.

18:53.720 --> 18:56.720
You do know that he's a...
What?

18:58.840 --> 19:00.560
He's a Fascist, Cecil.

19:03.120 --> 19:04.920
Well, better them
than the damned reds.

19:04.920 --> 19:07.800
But we agreed that we'd stay out
of local politics.

19:07.800 --> 19:10.080
You never know,
he might prove useful.

19:10.080 --> 19:12.280
Lady Latchmere
might come across him.

19:12.280 --> 19:13.960
Lady Latchmere

19:13.960 --> 19:16.160
They probably have more in common
than you think.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.560
Am I forgiven now?
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

19:23.560 --> 19:26.280
Bellakins.
Yes?

19:26.280 --> 19:29.440
Would you ask Albani
if he wants to join us?

19:29.440 --> 19:33.160
He might jolly the conversation
a little bit.  Yes.

19:34.760 --> 19:35.920
Do forgive me.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.360
CHATTER

19:51.360 --> 19:54.720
Rose. Mrs Drummond-Ward.

19:56.240 --> 19:58.240
CHATTER

20:38.280 --> 20:40.000
Gelato per la bambina...

20:40.000 --> 20:42.080
Will you try a gelato,
Mrs Drummond-Ward?

20:42.080 --> 20:43.480
I shan't.

21:17.200 --> 21:18.440
SHE EXHALES

21:28.200 --> 21:31.280
See, I'm just sort of
working light to dark.

21:31.280 --> 21:34.240
Then you end up with something
that looks sort of delicate.

21:34.240 --> 21:37.680
I see.
See, that's lovely.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.760
Thank you.

21:41.760 --> 21:44.200
What are they doing?

21:46.160 --> 21:50.520
They're diving for scallops.
Or sea urchins maybe.

21:50.520 --> 21:53.280
Is that Billy?
Billy?

21:55.200 --> 21:57.560
I was wondering
what he was doing this afternoon.

21:59.560 --> 22:04.320
Lucian, are you going
to take me swimming?

22:07.120 --> 22:09.160
Sorry, Lottie, I'm a bit busy.

22:09.160 --> 22:11.000
Oh.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.640
How about a paddle instead?
Yes!

22:13.640 --> 22:16.520
Shall we?
Come on, let's go in the water.

22:16.520 --> 22:18.080
We'll just dip our feet in.

22:23.200 --> 22:26.680
There's a little fish.
Oh!

22:34.000 --> 22:37.080
Nel mezzo
del cammin di nostra pita...

22:37.080 --> 22:39.720
Oh, no.
No, di nostra vita.

22:39.720 --> 22:42.800
Oh, vita.
It means "life".

22:42.800 --> 22:44.640
Oh, darling.
Oh, no, please. Please, no need.

22:44.640 --> 22:46.560
Do sit down.
Are you joining us?

22:46.560 --> 22:48.920
Sadly, no. I was just coming to see

22:48.920 --> 22:50.880
that you were being
well looked after.

22:50.880 --> 22:55.280
As always. Danioni has been
in raptures over the scones.

22:55.280 --> 22:57.760
Oh, yeah! Come si chiamano queste?

22:57.760 --> 23:00.480
A fat rascal, I believe.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.400
How apt!
Exquisite.

23:02.400 --> 23:06.000
Really, really, really... delicious.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.240
I'm so glad.

23:08.240 --> 23:10.360
Well, Mr Danioni thinks
we could make a bundle.

23:10.360 --> 23:14.080
Serving afternoon tea to the locals.
I have to agree with him.

23:15.280 --> 23:17.320
Unfortunately,
Betty is rather overstretched

23:17.320 --> 23:18.640
with all of our guests,

23:18.640 --> 23:20.920
but I shall be sure
to pass on the compliments.

23:20.920 --> 23:22.400
Thank you so much.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.280
Oh.
Don't know what all that was about.

23:30.920 --> 23:32.640
Anyway, where were we?

23:56.120 --> 23:57.520
May I borrow those?

23:59.680 --> 24:01.320
Of course.
Thank you.

24:03.760 --> 24:05.080
God's teeth.

24:07.360 --> 24:10.680
Oh, it's not much to look at.
Not yet, at least.

24:10.680 --> 24:14.080
I'd die happy if I could do
anything half as well as that.

24:15.360 --> 24:17.360
You're welcome to have a go,
if you want.

24:19.840 --> 24:21.840
Come on, put that down.

24:24.280 --> 24:27.880
Take that. Have a scribble.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.160
Uncle Lucian, look what Rose found!

24:37.160 --> 24:41.760
Did she? Must be worth a fortune,
Lots.

24:41.760 --> 24:44.800
Are you ready to resume?
My word!

24:44.800 --> 24:48.520
Oh, well...
What is it?

24:52.680 --> 24:55.960
Oh. Do you think she needs rescuing?

24:55.960 --> 24:59.560
Heavens, no. She'll be
selling tickets in a minute.

25:04.400 --> 25:06.320
Bellissima signorina, buon giorno.

25:09.480 --> 25:11.440
QUIET CHATTER

25:11.440 --> 25:14.160
Cosa devo fare per un po'
del suo tempo?

25:15.360 --> 25:19.760
Mi dica, per favore.
Solo un pochino.

25:32.720 --> 25:37.120
Two lemonades.
One for me, one for you.

26:01.840 --> 26:05.680
I must say, Signor Danioni,
that I'll think about it.

26:05.680 --> 26:08.800
You're confident we can drum up
this custom by next week?

26:08.800 --> 26:11.880
Absolutely!
I will make that possible.

26:11.880 --> 26:14.400
Where are these guests going to be
coming from, exactly?

26:14.400 --> 26:16.520
Well, people from the council...
The council?

26:16.520 --> 26:17.640
Yeah.
Right.

26:17.640 --> 26:20.480
What about the local aristocracy,
or something like that?

26:20.480 --> 26:24.280
Yeah, I will take care of that.
Allora arrivederci.

26:24.280 --> 26:27.360
Anche a voi. E mi raccomando.

26:31.120 --> 26:35.840
You don't much care for him.
Ah. Was it that obvious?

26:35.840 --> 26:38.760
No. Your manners were impeccable.

26:38.760 --> 26:41.960
Italy would be heaven if it weren't
so full of petty bureaucrats.

26:43.960 --> 26:47.920
You would be wise to tolerate him.
Because of his politics?

26:47.920 --> 26:50.720
Because men like Danioni
enjoy nothing better than making

26:50.720 --> 26:54.400
a perfect nuisance of themselves.
Yes, I'm learning that.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.960
So, how about next Thursday?

26:56.960 --> 26:58.520
Thursday?

26:58.520 --> 27:01.560
For our first tea party. Danioni's
promised to drum up some custom.

27:01.560 --> 27:03.440
Oh, Cecil.
That is presumptuous of you.

27:03.440 --> 27:06.280
Oh, nonsense. Nonsense.
What do you think, Carlo?

27:06.280 --> 27:08.600
The whole town
will beat a path to your door.

27:08.600 --> 27:11.480
We Italians pretend to despise
the perfidious English.

27:11.480 --> 27:14.720
But we aspire to be just like you.
Just as I thought.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.960
Care to join me for a drink?
Yes, sure. Maybe in a little while.

27:17.960 --> 27:21.280
Good, good.
Have I said the wrong thing?

27:21.280 --> 27:24.320
No, no, no. It's a lovely idea.

27:24.320 --> 27:26.880
I would be delighted to assist you
with your little project.

27:26.880 --> 27:29.840
Oh, well,
your help is always most welcome.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.840
Perhaps Mrs Mays-Smith and I
might plan the menu between us.

27:36.840 --> 27:40.280
Oh, that's a marvellous idea.
Yes, she would enjoy that.

27:40.280 --> 27:45.360
A perfect union of Italian gusto
and English refinement.

27:47.040 --> 27:49.160
Perfect. Would you excuse me?

28:11.040 --> 28:13.680
It's gone a bit strange here,
but you really made an effort.

28:13.680 --> 28:16.320
It's wonderful.
The perspective is spot on.

28:18.080 --> 28:21.120
Well, then, carry on.
You'll be an expert in no time.

28:26.040 --> 28:28.920
Oh, bother it!
Rose, I'm so sorry.

28:28.920 --> 28:31.800
It's ruined!
What is it?

28:31.800 --> 28:34.360
Paint, Mama.
Lucian, it won't come out.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.240
I told you to be careful.

28:37.240 --> 28:39.800
No, it was my fault,
Mrs Drummond-Ward.

28:39.800 --> 28:42.320
Her blouse brushed my palette.
It won't come out.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.040
No, it'll come out, I promise.
We just need to dab at it...

28:45.040 --> 28:46.840
No, Lucian...
Just let me dab at it.

28:46.840 --> 28:48.080
No, please.
It will.

28:48.080 --> 28:49.840
Just let me have a look...
Lucian, please.

28:49.840 --> 28:53.000
It's on your undershirt as well.
Oh, Lucian. No! I feel faint.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.440
We had best go back.
Of course.

28:57.440 --> 28:58.560
Immediately.

29:14.120 --> 29:16.920
What a bit of fuss,
over a bit of paint.

29:16.920 --> 29:18.400
She seemed very upset.

29:18.400 --> 29:21.360
Well,
who wears a silk dress to the beach?

29:21.360 --> 29:23.200
She just wanted to look her best.

29:25.080 --> 29:28.800
I shall be in the doghouse.
I'm sure Rose will forgive you.

29:30.640 --> 29:34.640
From my father, I mean.
Oh.

29:37.360 --> 29:40.680
Well, it'll be quicker to walk
than wait.

29:43.600 --> 29:45.480
I'm sorry to ask,
but can you manage?

29:45.480 --> 29:48.520
I don't mind.

30:09.000 --> 30:14.040
So, I take it
it wasn't a great success, darling.

30:14.040 --> 30:16.360
You could say that.

30:16.360 --> 30:20.600
Well, we shall just have to get
Paola to work her magic.

30:20.600 --> 30:23.600
What are you suggesting?

30:23.600 --> 30:25.760
Only that she could clean the dress.

30:27.120 --> 30:29.560
Has Father said anything?
Not to me.

30:29.560 --> 30:32.640
He's been drinking with
Count Albani.

30:32.640 --> 30:33.840
That's just my luck.

30:33.840 --> 30:38.080
I keep telling you, please
don't worry about what he wants.

30:38.080 --> 30:39.840
Well, try telling him that.

30:39.840 --> 30:42.120
All that matters
is whether you and Rose

30:42.120 --> 30:43.640
think you could be happy together.

30:45.240 --> 30:47.440
Do you think there's a chance?

30:47.440 --> 30:50.400
Well, it's rather difficult to make
any kind of impression at all

30:50.400 --> 30:54.760
with her mother hanging over us
like some awful gooseberry.

30:54.760 --> 31:01.480
Yes. Yes, she's rather difficult
to, er... shake off, isn't she?

31:03.080 --> 31:04.240
Oh, let me see.

31:07.640 --> 31:09.880
You know, I find it difficult
to imagine her and Father

31:09.880 --> 31:11.840
were ever an item at all.

31:11.840 --> 31:14.440
Oh, they were too young
to ever be serious.

31:14.440 --> 31:17.480
Really? They weren't engaged?

31:18.600 --> 31:22.280
Not formally, no.
I'd rather imagined that they were.

31:22.280 --> 31:25.040
I thought that's why Father
was so hell-bent

31:25.040 --> 31:27.880
on getting Rose and me hitched.

31:27.880 --> 31:29.840
I'm not sure I follow.

31:29.840 --> 31:33.760
You know,
righting the wrongs of the past.

31:33.760 --> 31:36.600
Him and Mrs Drummond-Ward not being
able to link the two estates

31:36.600 --> 31:39.400
by marriage, so they thought they'd
have another go with Rose and me.

31:39.400 --> 31:43.520
If that is his intention, he
certainly never confided it to me.

31:43.520 --> 31:47.360
Darling, I think
you should give it time with Rose.

31:49.160 --> 31:52.680
Oh, gosh. Look.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.760
She has an artistic eye.

31:57.960 --> 31:59.840
And that's something, isn't it?

32:03.640 --> 32:05.520
LOW CHATTER

32:15.720 --> 32:19.960
Please try, darling.
Just leave it, will you?

32:19.960 --> 32:21.080
Just... put on a good show.

32:21.080 --> 32:24.640
Can we talk about this later,
please?  Right.

32:24.640 --> 32:28.800
Questo e la mia ricetta,
come questa. Si?

32:28.800 --> 32:30.960
Grazie, perfetto.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.640
How the other half live, eh?

32:55.160 --> 32:57.760
I'd give my right ball for one
of those fancy drinks.

32:57.760 --> 33:01.240
SHE CHUCKLES
Sorry, may I?

33:01.240 --> 33:03.320
Hello, my darling.

33:05.680 --> 33:07.440
Constance...

33:13.040 --> 33:15.760
Hello.
Hope I'm not interrupting anything.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.680
Oh, not at all.
Lucian Ainsworth.

33:17.680 --> 33:20.960
Pelham Wingfield.
I know.

33:20.960 --> 33:23.920
This is my wife, Lizzie.
Hello.

33:23.920 --> 33:27.040
I saw you play in Queens. Er, 23.

33:27.040 --> 33:29.680
You beat some Australian.
Tom... something.

33:29.680 --> 33:31.960
Oh, Todd Philips.
Yes, that's the one.

33:31.960 --> 33:36.000
6-2, 6-4, 6-2, if I remember well.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.360
Well, 6-3 in the third,
but what's a game between friends?

33:39.360 --> 33:41.440
Well, you barely missed a ball.

33:41.440 --> 33:43.520
And now he rarely hits one.

33:45.720 --> 33:47.320
So what brings you to Portofino?

33:47.320 --> 33:49.880
Well, I played in Monte Carlo
last week...

33:49.880 --> 33:51.480
He lost in the first round.

33:51.480 --> 33:53.760
And I'm heading to Milan
at the end of the week.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.960
The local championships
start the Monday after.

33:55.960 --> 33:59.000
Which means we'll be taking
the train home on Tuesday.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.520
With any luck.

34:06.200 --> 34:08.600
Er, it's a wonderful spot.
Isn't it?

34:18.600 --> 34:21.440
Might I interest you
in a nightcap later?

34:21.440 --> 34:24.400
Oh, er...
"You" singular.

34:24.400 --> 34:26.440
Not "you" plural, honey.

34:28.640 --> 34:31.120
Well, if it's all the same to you,
I think I'll pass.

34:31.120 --> 34:33.560
Yeah. Perhaps tomorrow?

34:33.560 --> 34:35.760
Yes, perhaps.

34:35.760 --> 34:38.600
Ah, well. It can wait.

34:38.600 --> 34:41.440
What?
Hmm?

34:41.440 --> 34:43.080
What can wait?

34:43.080 --> 34:47.080
Oh, the story
of Grand-papa's Rubens.

34:47.080 --> 34:49.720
Sorry, your grandfather
owns a Rubens?

34:49.720 --> 34:51.520
Owned, not owns.

34:51.520 --> 34:54.360
He kicked the bucket right about
the time Her Majesty passed away.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.800
Uh-huh. And where is it now?

34:56.800 --> 34:59.040
Still hanging out back home,
I imagine.

34:59.040 --> 35:02.160
And you're... sure it's a Rubens?

35:02.160 --> 35:06.200
Well, I rather thought
you might tell me.

35:06.200 --> 35:08.800
Mm-hm.
A domani.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.640
Yeah.

35:17.760 --> 35:21.240
You look beautiful.
What do you want me to tell you?

35:32.000 --> 35:37.440
Melissa, have you found her?
Melissa, bring her here now.

35:37.440 --> 35:40.960
I can't bear it, Melissa.
I'm packing my bag.

35:40.960 --> 35:44.400
Is everything all right?
My aunt is most unhappy.

35:44.400 --> 35:48.960
Oh! Let's see
if we can resolve the issue.

35:50.440 --> 35:53.120
Completely inedible.

35:53.120 --> 35:56.760
I've almost chipped a tooth.
Your Ladyship, I'm terribly sorry.

35:56.760 --> 36:01.200
I shall get a fresh tray
brought up for you straight away.

36:02.280 --> 36:05.200
Melissa.
Yes?

36:05.200 --> 36:08.200
I'd like you to check.
Um...

36:09.680 --> 36:12.040
Ow!

36:13.920 --> 36:17.040
Rough.
Did I hurt you?

36:22.960 --> 36:26.920
Yes, I think I might need another.
Yes, Aunt.

36:37.960 --> 36:41.240
Oh, morning, darling.
Morning. Er, is there a problem?

36:41.240 --> 36:42.520
Why do you ask?

36:42.520 --> 36:45.640
Because there doesn't appear to be
any breakfast.

36:45.640 --> 36:47.440
Let me talk to Betty.

36:50.440 --> 36:52.720
What on earth is going on?

36:52.720 --> 36:54.720
SOBBING
Oh, Mrs Ainsworth...

36:54.720 --> 36:56.960
I can't get any sense out of her!

36:56.960 --> 37:02.160
Betty, remember when you took the
job. We said only your best will do.

37:02.160 --> 37:04.600
It's not her fault.
Hold your tongue!

37:04.600 --> 37:06.600
She can't make breakfast
from thin air.

37:06.600 --> 37:10.440
What do you mean, thin air?
There's no food, Mrs Ainsworth.

37:10.440 --> 37:12.080
See for yourself,
nothing's delivered.

37:12.080 --> 37:14.640
No bread, no butter,
no milk, no eggs.

37:14.640 --> 37:17.400
The cupboard's bare, ma'am.

37:21.880 --> 37:25.240
Oh, Billy.
Oh, you little beauty.

37:25.240 --> 37:27.960
The best I could do, ma'am.

37:27.960 --> 37:30.400
Nobody would sell me owt,
Mrs Ainsworth.

37:30.400 --> 37:34.600
I had to beg what I could.
There must be some misunderstanding.

37:36.800 --> 37:41.080
Begging your pardon, ma'am.
But, no, I don't think so.

37:41.080 --> 37:42.800
They shut the door in my face.

37:44.560 --> 37:46.280
BELL TOLLS

37:49.840 --> 37:52.600
CHURCH ORGAN PLAYING

38:35.800 --> 38:38.040
Don't worry, I shan't make a scene.

38:40.840 --> 38:42.880
Not before Mass, anyway.

39:03.960 --> 39:06.440
Ah-ha!
Ah!

39:06.440 --> 39:08.280
You didn't fancy church,
I take it.

39:08.280 --> 39:11.240
Oh, no. No, no.
I only kneel at the altar of Mammon.

39:11.240 --> 39:13.960
HE CHUCKLES
My sentiments exactly.

39:16.480 --> 39:20.520
I wondered if you'd... Well, if
you'd like to join me for a spin.

39:26.720 --> 39:28.840
Why not?

39:28.840 --> 39:31.000
Excellent.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.480
I am so sorry
that I didn't give you more notice

39:33.480 --> 39:37.360
that we were planning to come here
today.  I'm happy being spontaneous.

39:37.360 --> 39:40.400
Didn't think church
would be your thing.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.760
My thing?

39:41.760 --> 39:45.880
Well, because Lucian
has become so anti all of this.

39:45.880 --> 39:47.960
He says God died in the trenches.

39:47.960 --> 39:50.440
A lot of people we served with
feel the same.

39:50.440 --> 39:53.760
You were at the front?
Indian Medical Service.

39:53.760 --> 39:59.120
And do you think... God failed to
come back from the war, Mr Sengupta?

40:00.440 --> 40:03.920
England's God maybe. Not mine.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.480
Hello.

UPBEAT JAZZ PLAYS

40:43.200 --> 40:45.400
If the Eye-Ties had
had some kit like this in the war,

40:45.400 --> 40:47.480
they might have fared
a little better.

40:47.480 --> 40:49.280
You served?

40:49.280 --> 40:52.560
No. Not the last time.

40:52.560 --> 40:55.000
My fighting days
ended out in Africa,

40:55.000 --> 40:57.680
at the end of the last century.
Uh-huh.

40:57.680 --> 40:59.480
You?
No.

41:00.960 --> 41:03.080
No.
About this painting...

41:03.080 --> 41:05.520
Mm-hm.
I, er...

41:05.520 --> 41:08.280
I tore this
out of one of Lucian's art books.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.920
Well, that's not Rubens.

41:12.920 --> 41:14.640
I know, but the idea's
broadly the same.

41:14.640 --> 41:17.280
Venus With A Mirror.
That's the girl.

41:17.280 --> 41:19.240
She's quite a common theme
in Renaissance art.

41:19.240 --> 41:24.400
If you say so.
So, your Rubens, it isn't titled?

41:24.400 --> 41:27.320
No. And not signed either,
unfortunately.

41:27.320 --> 41:30.240
Well, that's not uncommon
for the period.

41:30.240 --> 41:34.320
Which is, presumably,
where people like you come in.

41:34.320 --> 41:35.720
Well, there's no way of knowing

41:35.720 --> 41:38.120
without getting my guy
to take a look at it.

41:38.120 --> 41:41.440
No, of course. Of course.
I'm having it sent over as we speak.

41:43.040 --> 41:44.520
You really are serious about this.

41:44.520 --> 41:48.440
I'm always serious
when it comes to making money.

41:48.440 --> 41:50.200
Aren't you?

41:51.960 --> 41:53.640
HE CHUCKLES

41:53.640 --> 41:56.520
Well, if it's not
what you say it is, then...

41:56.520 --> 42:00.240
it's a whole lot of trouble
to go to. For both of us.

42:01.240 --> 42:02.680
Don't worry, old boy.

42:04.040 --> 42:06.920
I'm sure we can find a way
to make it worth our while.

42:11.480 --> 42:13.200

42:17.840 --> 42:19.960

42:23.080 --> 42:25.640
Well, I never.
Maybe she didn't see you.

42:25.640 --> 42:28.920
Or didn't choose to.
THEY CHUCKLE

42:28.920 --> 42:31.800
What's funny, darling?
I think I've just been snubbed.

42:31.800 --> 42:33.840
Oh.
By Lady Caroline Haig.

42:33.840 --> 42:38.080
Should I know who that is?
The Earl of Harborne's daughter.

42:38.080 --> 42:41.040
They're staying at the big villa
in the hills.

42:41.040 --> 42:42.800
We called upon them
when they arrived.

42:42.800 --> 42:45.400
Yes.
I hope it is not my account.

42:45.400 --> 42:49.160
Oh, no. I'm sure there's a perfectly
innocent explanation.

42:49.160 --> 42:51.320
Buongiorno.

42:51.320 --> 42:52.840
Did I miss something?

42:52.840 --> 42:55.000
We were just talking about
the Haigs.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.400
Apparently you know Lady Caroline.
Oh, yes.

42:57.400 --> 43:00.680
I was at Oxford with her uncle.
Will you excuse me one moment?

43:00.680 --> 43:05.240
Signore... Una parola per favore.

43:05.240 --> 43:06.360
Mm-hm.

43:06.360 --> 43:11.640
I take it I have you to thank for
this morning's wonderful surprise.

43:11.640 --> 43:13.560
Sorry,
I don't understand what you mean.

43:13.560 --> 43:16.320
I think you do.
You said yourself,

43:16.320 --> 43:19.120
nothing occurs in this town
without you knowing about it.

43:19.120 --> 43:23.800
Oh, I see.
Well, perhaps I said that, yeah.

43:23.800 --> 43:28.040
And perhaps we could find a way
to resolve this difficulty.

43:28.040 --> 43:30.000
I simply cannot run the hotel

43:30.000 --> 43:32.720
without the town's supplies
or its goodwill.

43:36.600 --> 43:39.240
My wife.
Ah.

43:39.240 --> 43:42.360
Does your wife know
that you are blackmailing me?

43:42.360 --> 43:44.400
Please, such an ugly word!

43:46.080 --> 43:49.440
And then we do not believe
in blackmail in Italy, Signora.

43:49.440 --> 43:53.640
Oh, I see. What do you believe in?

43:55.120 --> 43:59.720
Furbizia. You know, being shrewd.
Oh.

43:59.720 --> 44:03.800
It is what puts food on our table
and buys dresses for our wives.

44:03.800 --> 44:06.600
Pretty dresses. Zaffiro?

44:08.400 --> 44:09.800
Yes. Sapphires.

44:09.800 --> 44:14.160
Yeah, zaffiro.
My wife, she likes very much.

44:22.880 --> 44:25.800
Don't get too close, Conny.
They'll give you a nasty little nip.

44:25.800 --> 44:27.880
I think they're dead, anyway.

44:27.880 --> 44:29.920
Glad to see you're recovered, Betty.

44:29.920 --> 44:33.720
Oh, thank you, Mrs Ainsworth.
I'm feeling much more myself.

44:33.720 --> 44:36.880
Gosh, someone's been busy.
It's Billy, ma'am.

44:36.880 --> 44:39.920
Did he catch them all by himself?
Oh, no, Mrs Ainsworth.

44:39.920 --> 44:42.120
There's some lads he knows
down by the harbour,

44:42.120 --> 44:45.040
they all help each other out.
Please do thank him for me.

44:45.040 --> 44:47.160
This will make
the most wonderful dinner.

44:47.160 --> 44:48.880
I'll pass it on, Mrs Ainsworth.

44:48.880 --> 44:52.200
Oh, and normal deliveries
shall resume tomorrow.

44:52.200 --> 44:54.880
Very relieved to hear it, ma'am.

44:54.880 --> 44:57.160
Gosh, he is rather an ugly fellow,
isn't he?

44:57.160 --> 45:00.840
We were just saying
the same thing, ma'am.

45:00.840 --> 45:04.240
It's the spit of my Uncle Albert.

45:04.240 --> 45:07.480
Well, let's just hope that they
taste better than they look.

45:07.480 --> 45:09.160
I'm just wracking my brain, ma'am,

45:09.160 --> 45:12.520
trying to think what to do with him.
Paola...

45:12.520 --> 45:15.840
Conosci questo tipo di pesce?
Si, pesce cappone.

45:15.840 --> 45:20.400
E buono da mangiare
in uno stufato di pesce.

45:20.400 --> 45:25.160
Ah, si. Then we shall bill it
as "A Taste Of Italy."

45:25.160 --> 45:27.080
Yes.

45:27.080 --> 45:29.480
See you later.
Ma'am.

45:29.480 --> 45:33.400
Well, then, Paola.

51:55.840 --> 51:58.200
Who shall I confide in now?

52:01.280 --> 52:02.520
CLATTERING

52:08.920 --> 52:12.160
Cecil? Is that you?

52:35.760 --> 52:39.560
Billy?!
I'm so sorry.

52:39.560 --> 52:42.600
I didn't know what else to do,
please don't be angry...

52:42.600 --> 52:45.320
What on earth?!
He's hurt.

52:45.320 --> 52:48.480
I-I didn't know
where else to take him.

52:48.480 --> 52:52.560
It's the Fascists, ma'am.
They've beaten him senseless.

52:54.680 --> 52:58.280
Oh, my goodness! Billy.

52:58.280 --> 53:03.600
Oh, Billy, he needs help.
Lift his head.
