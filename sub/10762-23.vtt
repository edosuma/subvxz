WEBVTT

00:08.541 --> 00:11.044
Well, I think we've got time for one last caller.

00:11.044 --> 00:12.045
Roz, who've we got?

00:12.512 --> 00:14.080
Mm-hmm.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.582
Mm-hmm.

00:15.582 --> 00:17.417
(pencil clatters )

00:20.754 --> 00:22.756
Well, I suppose I'll be fielding this last one myself.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.190
Let's try line two.

00:24.190 --> 00:27.227
Go ahead, caller, your name
and your problem, please.

00:27.227 --> 00:28.762
Yes, sir. My name's Ernie.

00:28.762 --> 00:31.264
And I'm real angry
at my dog.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.269
Okay, Ernie.
Uh, very often when, uh,

00:36.269 --> 00:38.271
people have
feelings towards their pets,

00:38.271 --> 00:41.274
it often reflects feelings
they have about themselves

00:41.274 --> 00:42.776
and their place in society.

00:42.776 --> 00:46.246
So, tell me, why are you
angry at your dog?

00:46.246 --> 00:50.784
Well, he keeps telling me
to take off my foil helmet.

00:57.791 --> 01:00.293
You hold on, Ernie. Um...

01:00.293 --> 01:02.796
Someone will come on the line
with the number of an expert

01:02.796 --> 01:04.297
in this sort of situation.

01:05.799 --> 01:09.302
Let's try, uh, line four
.

01:09.302 --> 01:11.204
ROZ: Oh, yes, of cours
e I'm interested.

01:11.571 --> 01:12.972
I'll fax my resume right over.

01:17.811 --> 01:18.812
Well, the news is up next,

01:19.245 --> 01:20.747
followed
by the market update

01:21.114 --> 01:21.681
with Julia Wilcox.

01:22.182 --> 01:23.183
That's it for me today.

01:23.183 --> 01:26.619
This is Dr. Frasier Crane saying
good day and good mental health.

01:28.421 --> 01:29.923
Another great show, Doc.

01:30.256 --> 01:31.624
Did you even listen?

01:31.891 --> 01:33.460
You don't have to eat
every Big Mac to know

01:33.460 --> 01:34.794
it's a delicious
hamburger sandwich.

01:36.629 --> 01:37.630
Roz, what's going on?

01:38.131 --> 01:40.133
I'm sorry, but they want
to interview me

01:40.133 --> 01:42.001
for the program director job
at KPXY.

01:42.302 --> 01:44.771
Well, that's great, but I didn't even know you were looking.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.507
I wasn't. They just
called me out of the blue.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.275
I'm actually shocked

01:49.609 --> 01:51.611
because I have very limited
experience in management, but...

01:51.978 --> 01:53.847
Well, Kenny's in management; how hard can it be?

01:55.982 --> 01:57.050
Hey, it's not that easy.

01:57.517 --> 02:00.520
I know it looks like a monkey
can do my job, but it can't.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.488
True story.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.358
Well, gosh, Roz, I...

02:05.358 --> 02:07.861
I must say, I've got sort
of mixed feelings about this.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.294
I couldn't be happier
that you're finally getting

02:09.696 --> 02:11.264
the recognition you deserve, but..

02:11.264 --> 02:12.632
but I'm
going to miss you.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.034
Well, let's wait till
there's a real offer

02:15.034 --> 02:17.871
before we break out
the Kleenex and champagne.

02:17.871 --> 02:18.705
Okay.

02:20.206 --> 02:22.709
Well, Roz, Kenny told me
about your job interview.

02:22.709 --> 02:23.576
Good luck.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.044
Oh, I get it.

02:25.044 --> 02:26.846
It'll be good luck

02:27.113 --> 02:29.182
because if I get the
job, I'll be gone.

02:29.182 --> 02:31.651
No, it sounds like
a good position for you.

02:31.651 --> 02:34.187
Right, 'cause I get into a lot of

02:34.687 --> 02:37.690
sexual positions
with a lot of guys

02:38.124 --> 02:40.493
I'm saying congratulations

02:40.727 --> 02:43.296
Oh. Thank you.

02:43.296 --> 02:45.298
What's her problem?

02:45.298 --> 02:46.799
Oh, I...

02:49.969 --> 02:50.904
Well, you're being

02:50.904 --> 02:53.373
uncharacteristically
decent today.

02:53.706 --> 02:54.741
You all right?

02:54.741 --> 02:55.742
I'm fine.

02:56.276 --> 02:58.611
All right, I might as well
tell you before he does.

02:58.978 --> 03:00.513
Avery and I broke up.

03:00.880 --> 03:04.350
Oh. Gosh, uh, what happened?

03:04.350 --> 03:08.021
I got tired of listening to him
promise he'd leave his wife.

03:08.021 --> 03:11.057
Well, I'm sorry.

03:11.057 --> 03:12.759
I realize you must
be going through..

03:12.759 --> 03:14.327
Oh, I don't need
your sympathy, okay?

03:14.327 --> 03:17.197
I'm not one of your pathetic code three whackadoos.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.432
I was just
trying to help

03:19.432 --> 03:21.834
No need to insult
my callers.

03:21.834 --> 03:22.769
Foil Helmet Guy says

03:22.769 --> 03:24.804
his dog needs
to speak to you.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:35.114 --> 03:37.584
Oh. Excuse me, uh...
Hi, Daph.

03:37.584 --> 03:39.085
Hello.
Gosh, I've never
 seen this place so crowded.

03:39.085 --> 03:40.086
What's the occasion?

03:40.553 --> 03:41.120
It's Mum's day off.

03:41.588 --> 03:43.389
Apparently,
there was a mass e-mail.

03:45.758 --> 03:47.260
So, is Niles going to be joining us?

03:47.694 --> 03:49.596
No. He's taking your father
to the shooting range.

03:49.862 --> 03:51.431
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
I had forgotten.

03:51.431 --> 03:52.932
He'd asked me to take him,

03:52.932 --> 03:54.434
but then I suggested
that when it comes to guns,

03:54.934 --> 03:58.805
perhaps he would prefer
someone of Niles's caliber

03:58.805 --> 03:59.939
(chuckling)

03:59.939 --> 04:02.208
I'm in rare form today.

04:02.208 --> 04:03.676
You should see this place

04:03.676 --> 04:05.545
when they know
you're not coming.

04:05.545 --> 04:07.914
JULIA:
No, Avery, it's...

04:07.914 --> 04:10.984
two-thirds of the work
on that program is mine.

04:10.984 --> 04:14.487
Well, I don't have
 to prove it; it's a fact!

04:14.487 --> 04:17.457
Oh. Oh, yeah?

04:17.857 --> 04:19.425
Well, I should
have expected as
much from a man

04:19.425 --> 04:21.793
who wears leopard
print bikini briefs.

04:21.793 --> 04:27.667
Avery McManus wears shiny acetate man panties!

04:33.072 --> 04:34.974
Excuse me.

04:37.477 --> 04:39.512
Is everything okay?

04:39.512 --> 04:43.016
No. Now that I've dump
ed your bastard accountant,

04:43.016 --> 04:46.419
he's trying to cut me out of our software program.

04:46.419 --> 04:47.787
Software program?

04:47.787 --> 04:50.657
We-- mostly me-- developed
a proprietary method

04:50.657 --> 04:53.159
for analyzing
price/volume momentum--

04:53.159 --> 04:55.061
I call it
vector scaling--

04:55.061 --> 04:57.964
that can quantify the likelihood
of longer term trends.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.799
Do you realize what that means?

05:01.167 --> 05:02.969
It's good?

05:02.969 --> 05:04.304
That program is my baby.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.306
I have been working on it for months.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.274
I think your
bastard accountant

05:08.274 --> 05:10.510
has been using me all along

05:10.777 --> 05:12.111
Thanks for
setting us up.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.680
I did no such thing.

05:13.946 --> 05:15.014
You know what I ought to do?

05:15.014 --> 05:17.016
I ought to go down to
his office, demand my files,

05:17.450 --> 05:18.518
and then trash
the place.

05:18.518 --> 05:19.485
Ju-Just a second.
Just a second.

05:19.485 --> 05:22.021
Just sit down.
Sit down, please.

05:23.289 --> 05:24.857
Take a moment
to calm down

05:24.857 --> 05:27.193
before you make
any rash decisions.

05:27.460 --> 05:29.028
In a few hours, I'm
leaving town for a week.

05:29.028 --> 05:31.030
There's no way I'm leaving your bastard accountant

05:31.030 --> 05:33.032
in control of those files.

05:33.466 --> 05:34.534
All right, well,
if you insist,

05:34.534 --> 05:36.035
then perhaps
I should go with you.

05:36.035 --> 05:37.804
Maybe I can help
facilitate things.

05:38.004 --> 05:38.971
Why? What's in it for you?

05:39.305 --> 05:41.874
Nothing. Surely you can
conceive of the possibility

05:42.375 --> 05:45.645
that someone might want to
just do something nice for you?

05:45.878 --> 05:47.780
You and Avery are in this
together, aren't you?

05:48.047 --> 05:51.084
Of course not. You're not
being rational, you know.

05:51.084 --> 05:54.120
Perhaps Avery is just holding
your program hostage

05:54.120 --> 05:55.388
because he feels hurt.

05:55.388 --> 05:56.989
Perhaps this is

05:56.989 --> 05:59.158
his clumsy way of trying
to initiate a dialogue.

06:00.593 --> 06:03.396
You really do try to see
the best in everyone, don't you?

06:04.297 --> 06:05.631
Yes, I do.

06:05.631 --> 06:10.203
So, what do you see
when you look at me?

06:12.472 --> 06:14.974
Well...

06:14.974 --> 06:16.976
I see a woman
who's been hurt,

06:16.976 --> 06:19.879
not once but many times.

06:19.879 --> 06:23.316
A woman who finds it
so difficult to trust someone

06:23.316 --> 06:26.285
that she won't allow
herself to be vulnerable.

06:26.285 --> 06:28.755
A woman whose eyes
are going to get stuck

06:28.755 --> 06:31.257
if she keeps rolling them
like that!

06:36.262 --> 06:38.264
(loud gunfire)

06:45.271 --> 06:48.274
Ah! Look at that grouping.

06:48.274 --> 06:50.777
Hey, uh, Dad,
you about ready to go?

06:51.277 --> 06:53.212
I guess I've still
got the touch.

06:53.546 --> 06:55.615
Hey, Niles, you ought to give it a try.

06:55.615 --> 06:58.117
Thanks, Dad. You know
how I feel about handguns.

06:58.117 --> 06:59.619
They breed violence.

06:59.619 --> 07:01.120
Oh, come on. This is just simple

07:01.120 --> 07:04.624
target shooting,
that's all.

07:04.624 --> 07:06.092
(laughing)

07:06.092 --> 07:07.593
Yeah.

07:07.960 --> 07:11.030
Here's one dirtbag that isn't going to be selling crack

07:11.030 --> 07:13.299
at any schoolyards anytime soon.

07:16.035 --> 07:18.604
You should listen to the man.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.406
Shooting is a great sport.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.108
Red Brewer.

07:22.475 --> 07:24.944
And these clowns here
are Mitch and Wayne.

07:25.244 --> 07:25.812
Hello.
Wayne.

07:26.312 --> 07:27.313
Mitch.
Hi.

07:27.313 --> 07:29.148
I'm Niles Crane. This
is my father Martin Crane.

07:29.649 --> 07:30.650
Oh. Hi.
How you doing, guys?

07:30.650 --> 07:32.485
Listen, Niles, let me
show you how to do this.

07:32.885 --> 07:33.953
I think you'll enjoy it.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.922
Oh...
It's pretty simple.

07:36.322 --> 07:37.824
You just take a solid stance,

07:37.824 --> 07:39.392
hold the grip firmly,

07:39.392 --> 07:41.394
steady your gun hand
with your other,

07:41.394 --> 07:42.895
fingers to fingers,
thumb to thumb.

07:42.895 --> 07:45.898
Focus on the front sight
and squeeze the trigger.

07:47.366 --> 07:49.335
Okay? You try it.

07:49.335 --> 07:51.904
Oh, you know, no offense,
but I, uh, I just...

07:51.904 --> 07:53.339
I'm not real comfortable
with guns.

07:53.339 --> 07:55.274
You know, Mitch used
to be that way, too.

07:55.274 --> 07:56.609
MITCH:
Yeah.

07:56.609 --> 07:58.611
The only weapon I'd
go near was a bow and arrow.

07:58.611 --> 08:02.882
I, uh, I got an archery
badge at day camp.

08:02.882 --> 08:05.718
This is like archery
but safer.

08:05.718 --> 08:07.220
The weapon's more stable,

08:07.220 --> 08:08.187
and you're
in a controlled environment.

08:08.187 --> 08:10.189
Go on, give
it a try, son.

08:10.189 --> 08:12.692
Well, I... just,
I'll do one little one.

08:13.192 --> 08:18.197
Just remember, stance,
grip, aim, relax, shoot.

08:18.197 --> 08:19.198
Okay.

08:19.198 --> 08:20.199
Stance.

08:20.199 --> 08:21.200
Grip.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.201
Aim.

08:22.201 --> 08:23.202
Relax.

08:23.202 --> 08:24.203
Shoot.

08:27.206 --> 08:28.207
Did I do it?

08:28.708 --> 08:31.210
You not only did it,
you hit the target.

08:31.210 --> 08:33.546
See? Sixth ring out.

08:33.546 --> 08:35.381
Look at the kid, he hit
the target his first time.

08:35.381 --> 08:36.381
Not bad, kid.

08:36.381 --> 08:38.683
Way to go, kid.
That's my kid.

08:38.885 --> 08:40.953
That was, uh, that was
a unique experience.

08:40.953 --> 08:43.389
I'm sure I'll dine out
on that story for months.

08:43.389 --> 08:44.857
Don't quit now,
go again.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.359
But remember, this time,

08:46.359 --> 08:48.361
squeeze the trigger,
don't pull.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.862
Okay.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.364
Squeeze...

08:51.364 --> 08:52.865
(muttering)

08:54.867 --> 08:55.868
(guffaws)

08:56.369 --> 08:57.370
Wow. You're pretty good at this.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.071
The kid's a natural,
am I right?

08:59.071 --> 09:00.406
(laughing)
: Yeah.

09:00.406 --> 09:01.841
Can I go again?

09:01.841 --> 09:02.742
Yeah.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.756
What took you so long?

09:16.756 --> 09:18.257
I was looking
for street parking

09:18.257 --> 09:20.760
Do you have any idea how much this garage charges?

09:21.928 --> 09:23.896
Avery's not here.
Oh, great.

09:24.196 --> 09:25.765
It cost me $3.50 to find that out.

09:25.765 --> 09:28.267
No, it's good. It'll
make it easier for me

09:28.267 --> 09:29.268
to get my program back.

09:29.268 --> 09:30.269
What do you mean?

09:30.269 --> 09:31.771
I know his keypad code.

09:31.771 --> 09:33.606
Wh-Wh-What...? That
is breaking and entering.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.741
Oh, if you're so scared,
why don't you just leave?

09:35.942 --> 09:38.277
Well, I'm-I'm not scared. I... I'm...

09:39.612 --> 09:41.414
I'll have you know, I've had

09:41.414 --> 09:42.615
my fair share of escapades.

09:42.615 --> 09:45.084
Back in med school, I once dressed a cadaver..

09:45.551 --> 09:46.452
Oh, here's my program.

09:46.852 --> 09:49.336
Okay, good. Now,
just in case he backed it up,

09:50.056 --> 09:53.059
I'm going to delete everything from his hard drive.

09:53.392 --> 09:54.961
Julia, I-I-I beg
you to rethink this.

09:54.961 --> 09:56.429
I realize you're
angry at Avery...

09:56.862 --> 09:57.930
I'm not feeling anger,

09:57.930 --> 09:59.432
just the peace
that comes with knowing

09:59.432 --> 10:02.868
that Avery will be royally
screwed by me.

10:03.235 --> 10:05.304
There's somebody at the door.

10:17.016 --> 10:19.018
(whispering):
It's the cleaning woman.

10:19.518 --> 10:22.321
I thought so. I've
hidden from her before.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.458
Julia, there's still time to end this.

10:25.758 --> 10:26.826
Shh...!

10:26.826 --> 10:29.128
You know what you're doing is wrong.

10:29.328 --> 10:32.698
You should just get out now before more harm is done.

10:32.932 --> 10:34.000
Will you shut up?!

10:34.000 --> 10:35.501
It's pointless
to hide in the closet

10:35.501 --> 10:37.503
if people outside
can hear you.

10:37.503 --> 10:39.005
You're going to get caught.

10:39.005 --> 10:40.506
Because you won't shut up.

10:40.506 --> 10:43.843
It's never too late to do the right thing.

10:44.076 --> 10:45.645
No matter how low
someone else sinks

10:45.645 --> 10:48.814
joining them there does not make things better

10:58.257 --> 10:59.258
(door shuts)

11:11.504 --> 11:12.938
What was that?

11:12.938 --> 11:14.173
What?

11:14.173 --> 11:15.875
You kissed me.

11:15.875 --> 11:18.110
I was trying to shut you up.

11:18.110 --> 11:21.514
Oh, no. I've been kissed
to shut me up before.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.282
This was not that.

11:23.282 --> 11:24.550
(taps key)

11:24.550 --> 11:27.053
Got it. All files deleted.

11:27.553 --> 11:30.856
You know, that didn't make me feel as good as I thought.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.559
That's because you know
you did the wrong thing.

11:36.328 --> 11:39.498
Ah, that's better.

11:45.438 --> 11:46.439
Well, it doesn't look like

11:46.439 --> 11:49.275
I'll be leaving KACL
anytime soon.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.110
Coffee to go, please.

11:51.110 --> 11:53.612
Well...
what-what happened, Roz?

11:53.612 --> 11:55.081
Turns out the person

11:55.481 --> 11:58.484
who's interviewing me
is a guy I've slept with

11:59.785 --> 12:01.854
What are the odds?

12:05.424 --> 12:08.494
It was ten years ago at a convention in Cancun

12:08.494 --> 12:09.495
We were all hammered.

12:09.995 --> 12:10.796
Oh, well,

12:11.063 --> 12:12.064
I'm surprised
you even remember him.

12:12.431 --> 12:13.499
Well, it's hard to forget

12:13.499 --> 12:15.501
when you wake up with
a name tag on your pillow

12:15.501 --> 12:18.938
that says, "Hola, my
name is Woody Wiswell".

12:25.578 --> 12:26.946
So what's the problem?

12:27.279 --> 12:28.848
There's just something weird about it.

12:28.848 --> 12:30.850
I don't know, maybe I'm just freaking myself out

12:30.850 --> 12:33.185
because I'm not sure if
I'm ready for this job yet.

12:33.519 --> 12:34.587
Well, of course
you are, Roz.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.088
I mean, come on,
don't doubt yourself.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.923
They're the ones
that called you, right?

12:38.157 --> 12:39.024
Yeah.
You go down there,

12:39.291 --> 12:40.359
you get that job.

12:40.359 --> 12:41.794
You're going to make
a great program director.

12:42.161 --> 12:43.195
You really think I will?

12:43.629 --> 12:44.697
Of course I do.

12:44.697 --> 12:49.535
Even though... I wish you
could stay with me forever.

12:49.835 --> 12:53.506
I'm going to miss you
so much, Roz.

12:53.506 --> 12:54.373
Oh, stop it.

12:54.874 --> 12:56.342
I don't even
have the job yet.

12:56.342 --> 12:57.877
You're going to jinx it.

12:57.877 --> 12:58.878
Thank you.

12:58.878 --> 13:00.746
Listen, I better go

13:00.746 --> 13:02.047
and get my
presentation together

13:02.047 --> 13:03.549
so I can impress
Woody Wiswell.

13:03.549 --> 13:06.051
Seems to me

13:06.051 --> 13:07.553
you've impressed him already

13:11.891 --> 13:13.392
Hello.
Julia!

13:13.392 --> 13:15.361
Can I have
a latte to go, please?

13:15.361 --> 13:16.729
Listen, Julia, Julia..

13:17.029 --> 13:18.898
I've been dying to talk to you all week about what happened

13:19.165 --> 13:20.065
at Avery's office.

13:20.399 --> 13:21.467
Obviously something is going on,

13:21.467 --> 13:24.470
and I have
several hypotheses

13:24.970 --> 13:26.472
It could be
displaced passion,

13:26.472 --> 13:28.974
frustration from
a failed relationship,

13:28.974 --> 13:30.476
or an adrenaline- induced action

13:30.976 --> 13:33.979
as a result of the stress we
were both suffering from...

13:33.979 --> 13:36.115
Oh, Frasier,
for once in your life,

13:36.115 --> 13:39.084
would you
please shut up?

13:39.084 --> 13:40.619
Oh, hi.
Hello.

13:40.619 --> 13:43.088
Hi, guys.
Hey, Frasier.

13:43.088 --> 13:45.124
Hey, Fras, you look a little down.

13:45.124 --> 13:46.091
Everything okay?

13:46.091 --> 13:47.459
Uh, two coffees, please?

13:47.459 --> 13:49.261
Dad, if you had
any perspicacity whatsoever,

13:49.261 --> 13:51.263
you would know
that this expression

13:51.263 --> 13:52.765
is merely ruminative perplexity.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.067
My bad.

13:56.969 --> 13:58.404
It's nothing serious.

13:58.404 --> 13:59.672
I'll work it out.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.440
You know where I like
to work things out?

14:01.440 --> 14:02.775
The shooting range.

14:02.775 --> 14:05.110
Good Lord, Niles,
are you still going down there?

14:05.110 --> 14:06.712
I thought you hated guns.

14:06.712 --> 14:09.281
Oh, believe me, I never expected
I'’d like it as much as I do,

14:09.281 --> 14:10.783
but when you're in that booth

14:11.283 --> 14:14.086
focused on precision
and accuracy,

14:14.086 --> 14:15.688
it's not dissimilar to a kind of meditation

14:15.688 --> 14:16.789
Wouldn't you agree, Dad?

14:16.789 --> 14:18.624
I just like to shoot stuff, son.

14:20.125 --> 14:21.126
Fair enough.

14:21.126 --> 14:22.628
You should join us.

14:22.628 --> 14:24.129
There's a great bunch of guys I shoot with.

14:24.630 --> 14:25.598
I think you'd like them.

14:25.598 --> 14:27.499
Well, I'm not sure I'd fit in

14:27.499 --> 14:29.535
with a bunch of trigger-happy
gun nuts.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.036
Now don't stereotype them.

14:31.036 --> 14:33.405
These are decent family men
who enjoy marksmanship.

14:33.405 --> 14:34.773
It's a good
group we've got.

14:34.773 --> 14:36.208
Dad and I are going down
this afternoon.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.643
I don't think I'm going to come
today, Niles.

14:37.643 --> 14:40.446
Well... it's Mitch's birthday.

14:40.446 --> 14:42.781
I usually go shooting
twice a year or so,

14:43.282 --> 14:45.584
and after this week,
I've had my fill.

14:45.584 --> 14:46.352
Well...
Thank you.

14:46.352 --> 14:47.653
I'm still going.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.355
My shooting's getting better and better.

14:49.355 --> 14:50.789
Plus, the gun show's in town

14:50.789 --> 14:52.291
and the guys
are bringing me passes.

14:52.291 --> 14:53.192
Mm!

14:53.192 --> 14:55.628
A gun show?

14:55.628 --> 14:58.130
What's next? Square dancing?

14:59.098 --> 15:01.033
Maybe.

15:01.033 --> 15:04.937
This country was built
by gun-toting square dancers.

15:09.174 --> 15:10.643
So, I really appreciate

15:10.643 --> 15:12.578
you bringing me in
for this interview.

15:12.945 --> 15:15.014
I've been listening
to your station for a while

15:15.014 --> 15:17.016
and I prepared
a little presentation

15:20.619 --> 15:22.187
Oh, that's not necessary

15:22.187 --> 15:24.690
I mean, this is
just a formality.

15:24.690 --> 15:27.126
Trust me,
I know what you can do.

15:31.530 --> 15:32.531
Really?

15:32.531 --> 15:33.532
Yeah, I, uh...

15:33.933 --> 15:36.302
I already told the guys
about you.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.073
What exactly
did you tell them?

15:41.473 --> 15:44.310
Well, you know,
how incredible you are.

15:44.543 --> 15:47.613
Okay, look,
I think there's something

15:48.113 --> 15:49.615
that needs to be said here.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.116
Why don't we just
get it all out in open?

15:51.116 --> 15:53.619
Yes, we slept together
in Cancun,

15:53.619 --> 15:55.621
but I don't want that
to affect the job.

15:55.621 --> 15:56.588
I mean, it was ten years ago.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.524
What are you talking about?

15:58.524 --> 16:02.027
Look, I think you have me
mistaken for someone else.

16:04.930 --> 16:07.933
And I think I would remember
a name like Woody Wiswell.

16:07.933 --> 16:10.936
I mean, seriously,
whose named Woody Wiswell?

16:10.936 --> 16:11.704
Yeah, well

16:11.904 --> 16:13.339
just me and my dad.

16:22.715 --> 16:25.217
Darling, I just don't think
you need an ankle holster

16:25.217 --> 16:27.586
when you don't even
own a gun.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.556
Well, first of all,
who says it's for me,

16:30.556 --> 16:32.992
Miss
I-Never-Surprise-You-Anymore?

16:33.359 --> 16:35.361
And, second of all

16:35.728 --> 16:37.229
I'm thinking
I might own a gun soon.

16:37.596 --> 16:38.931
No you won't.
No, no, no

16:39.231 --> 16:40.299
don't worry.

16:40.299 --> 16:42.801
I... I would keep the gun in
a locker at the shooting range.

16:42.801 --> 16:44.770
I would never have a gun
in the same house

16:44.770 --> 16:45.771
as your mother

16:47.806 --> 16:50.809
Now they're saying Daisy Duke may not get here.

16:52.578 --> 16:54.113
Hey.
Hey, how's it going, kid?

16:54.113 --> 16:55.381
Hey...

16:55.381 --> 16:56.615
Hey, you guys, how are you?

16:56.615 --> 16:58.584
Listen, I want you to meet
my wife Daphne.

16:58.584 --> 16:59.985
Daphne, this is Red
and Wayne and Mitch.

16:59.985 --> 17:01.487
These are the guys
I was telling you about.

17:01.487 --> 17:02.921
Nice to meet you.
Good to know you.

17:02.921 --> 17:04.423
Listen, kid.
Yeah?

17:04.423 --> 17:05.391
We've been talking it over

17:05.391 --> 17:07.425
and since we get along so well
at the club,

17:07.425 --> 17:09.928
we'd like to invite you do
wn to our compound in Idaho

17:10.429 --> 17:11.296
for a weekend.

17:13.665 --> 17:16.667
A compound?

17:16.667 --> 17:18.569
It's just
like the Kennedys

17:20.806 --> 17:23.175
That sounds smashing.

17:23.175 --> 17:24.643
Hey, that's the spirit.
See, I told you.

17:25.144 --> 17:26.444
Hey, look, you're
good at math, right?

17:26.444 --> 17:27.546
Come help me guess

17:27.546 --> 17:28.847
how many shells are in that jar

17:29.314 --> 17:30.215
so I can win the ATV.

17:30.215 --> 17:31.050
Oh, excuse me.

17:31.483 --> 17:33.018
What kind of TV?

17:33.018 --> 17:34.520
Nice to meet
you, ma'am

17:34.520 --> 17:35.988
Oh, uh, Red, hold on sec.

17:35.988 --> 17:37.322
Uh...

17:37.589 --> 17:39.458
Just what kind of place
do you guys have in Idaho?

17:39.458 --> 17:41.794
Run-of-the-mill compound
in the wilderness.

17:41.794 --> 17:44.997
Free country where we live
by the true Constitution.

17:48.333 --> 17:50.836
They're those militia people.

17:50.836 --> 17:53.105
You fix this, now.

17:53.105 --> 17:54.339
This is fun, huh?

17:54.339 --> 17:55.374
Uh, son...

17:55.374 --> 17:56.875
What your
father means is

17:56.875 --> 17:58.877
you shouldn't be friends
with these people.

17:58.877 --> 18:00.379
Yeah, these are not your kind of guys.

18:00.379 --> 18:02.281
Why not?
Well, let's just go

18:02.281 --> 18:04.183
and we'll talk about it
in the car.

18:04.183 --> 18:05.684
Oh, I can't
believe you two.

18:05.684 --> 18:07.186
You're always telling me
my friends

18:07.186 --> 18:08.687
are too artsy and too snooty.

18:08.687 --> 18:10.689
Now I finally have friends
who are regular guys

18:10.689 --> 18:12.091
and you don't like them either

18:12.091 --> 18:13.392
Well, I'm having a good time.

18:13.392 --> 18:15.561
And I'm enjoying
being a regular guy myself.

18:15.561 --> 18:19.098
Niles, we think they want
to overthrow the government.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.768
That's what you say
about public television.

18:22.768 --> 18:25.204
Now if you'll excuse me.

18:25.204 --> 18:26.705
Hey, guys, whatcha doing?

18:26.705 --> 18:29.975
We're chipping in for
this gas-powered generator.

18:29.975 --> 18:30.776
We're going to need it

18:31.276 --> 18:32.277
when it comes time for the New World Order.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.646
Well, that sounds great.
Excuse me just a second.

18:34.646 --> 18:36.515
Okay, they're militia.

18:36.515 --> 18:37.516
Go, go, go, go

18:40.018 --> 18:42.020
I just don't understand

18:42.020 --> 18:44.823
how this sort of thing can happen

18:45.057 --> 18:48.494
Don't you look at faces?

18:48.794 --> 18:50.863
It was long time ago.

18:51.363 --> 18:52.331
It was dark.

18:52.731 --> 18:54.233
And get off my case

18:54.666 --> 18:55.734
because it
doesn't matter anyway.

18:55.734 --> 18:56.735
I got the job.

18:56.735 --> 18:58.237
Oh, congratulations, Roz.

18:58.237 --> 18:59.238
I'm so proud of you.

18:59.238 --> 19:00.239
Now can I tell you

19:00.239 --> 19:02.574
how much I'm
going to miss you?
Yes.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.911
It is going to be sad
to leave the station.

19:05.911 --> 19:09.281
But it's not like
I'm leaving town, Frasier.

19:09.548 --> 19:11.617
I know, I know

19:11.617 --> 19:13.118
I'll see you.

19:15.587 --> 19:17.623
See you, Roz.
Bye.

19:20.092 --> 19:23.862
Julia! Julia! Julia!

19:24.163 --> 19:25.197
All right.

19:27.266 --> 19:30.102
Now, listen. You can try to avoid me all you like.

19:30.402 --> 19:31.737
We are going to talk
this thing out.

19:31.937 --> 19:34.439
Fine. Fine.

19:34.439 --> 19:36.408
Anything to get you off my back.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.079
I was looking at you
in the closet

19:41.079 --> 19:43.081
and thinking how you always
try to do the right thing,

19:43.081 --> 19:46.952
and I felt a rush of affection
for you.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.923
Call me cynical,
but I've come to accept

19:51.290 --> 19:53.859
that most people live by
the rule of screw or be screwed.

19:53.859 --> 19:57.262
But to see you
and how much you care,

19:57.596 --> 19:59.565
and really mean it, I...

19:59.898 --> 20:03.802
well, it's endearing--
irritating, but endearing.

20:04.069 --> 20:07.139
Well, you know,
I... I am flattered,

20:07.573 --> 20:10.142
but there are a lot of genuine
people out there.

20:10.142 --> 20:13.645
It's just that for whatever reason-- fear, anger, hurt,

20:13.645 --> 20:15.113
they're afraid to show it.

20:23.021 --> 20:24.489
Oh! It's just like
the feeling you get

20:25.057 --> 20:26.491
when you see a cute teddy bear
in the store

20:26.491 --> 20:29.061
and you want to hug it
until its head pops off.

20:31.663 --> 20:35.567
Could I possibly irritate you
over dinner some night?

20:35.934 --> 20:39.271
Well, if anyone could,
it'd be you.

20:39.471 --> 20:42.541
Take your time,
work things out.

20:42.541 --> 20:44.042
I'm not going anywhere.

20:44.042 --> 20:46.011
I realize that you're in
 a vulnerable place right now

20:46.011 --> 20:47.346
and that..

20:47.346 --> 20:49.214
Oh, I recognize that one.

20:49.214 --> 20:51.116
That was to shut me up.

20:51.116 --> 20:52.517
Yeah.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.020
Maybe Thursday.

20:57.522 --> 20:59.024
