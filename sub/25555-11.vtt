but I was never beaten.

35:13.177 --> 35:14.312
I was beat down.

35:14.378 --> 35:15.746
But my thing is...

35:15.813 --> 35:17.615
I was never taught
to be your own person.

35:17.682 --> 35:19.584
I was taught to be
a certain way,

35:19.650 --> 35:21.152
and if you weren't
that certain way,

35:21.219 --> 35:23.421
you were beat
into being that way.

{\an5}See, that's (bleep) up.

35:23.488 --> 35:25.156
{\an3}Yeah.

35:25.223 --> 35:26.891
And that's why I have
problems now

35:26.958 --> 35:28.526
with, like,
being who I am,

35:28.593 --> 35:30.027
because I feel like
I can't be who I am

35:30.094 --> 35:31.195
without being judged
about it.

35:31.262 --> 35:33.498
I'm sorry, Gus,
I really am.

35:33.564 --> 35:35.199
It's all good.

35:35.266 --> 35:36.667
Gave me tough skin,
you know?

35:36.734 --> 35:38.669
In order to understand
the type of person that I am,

35:38.736 --> 35:40.071
the reason I get upset

35:40.137 --> 35:41.639
over things that I get
upset about in the house,

35:41.706 --> 35:43.207
then you have to know
my background.

35:43.274 --> 35:44.909
You have to know
what pushed me to that.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.444
Like, growing up...

35:46.511 --> 35:48.713
my mom, she starts
having a freakin' affair.

35:48.779 --> 35:49.881
I get home from school,

35:49.947 --> 35:52.583
I walk in their bedroom,
I walk in on it.

35:52.650 --> 35:55.553
I tell my dad
and what does he do?

35:55.620 --> 35:57.522
He leaves, and he leaves
with another woman.

35:57.588 --> 36:00.424
And leaves me
with kids and my mom...

36:00.491 --> 36:02.059
and I hated my mom...

36:02.126 --> 36:04.195
because I walked in
on her with another man.

36:04.262 --> 36:05.363
{\an5}God...

36:04.262 --> 36:05.363
And so my dad,

36:05.429 --> 36:06.998
he comes back
a week or two later,

36:07.064 --> 36:08.833
I say,
"This is (bleep) up,"

36:08.900 --> 36:10.434
and he says, "Well, if you
don't (bleep) like it,

36:10.501 --> 36:11.602
you can get out."

36:11.669 --> 36:13.070
We ended up
getting into a scrap.

36:13.137 --> 36:14.539
I'm bigger than my dad.

36:14.605 --> 36:16.040
I ended up winning that.

36:16.107 --> 36:18.175
{\an1}Because his pride was hurt,
I was (bleep) kicked out.

36:20.711 --> 36:22.713
I've never told anybody
the whole story.

36:22.780 --> 36:24.749
I hate being vulnerable,
I hate opening up,

36:24.815 --> 36:26.183
but you have to be vulnerable.

36:26.250 --> 36:28.052
You have to let,
you know, your walls down

36:28.119 --> 36:29.420
and open up to people.

36:29.487 --> 36:32.089
Right after
that fight happened...

36:32.156 --> 36:33.791
he looks me
in the eye and says,

36:33.858 --> 36:36.160
{\an1}"You're a piece of (bleep),
you're not a good person,

36:36.227 --> 36:38.029
you will never amount
to anything."

36:38.095 --> 36:40.965
And so that's why,
in this house,

36:41.032 --> 36:43.801
when people come at me
for my character,

36:43.868 --> 36:46.037
it takes me back to that.

36:46.103 --> 36:48.005
I don't feel like I can have
the conversation with the girls

36:48.072 --> 36:50.107
in regards to why I am
the way I am,

36:50.174 --> 36:52.109
why I get upset
when you call me sensitive,

36:52.176 --> 36:54.011
because I don't feel
like they listen.

36:54.078 --> 36:55.913
I feel like I can have this
conversation with Kirk and Codi

36:55.980 --> 36:58.516
because they actually listen
to me when I talk.

36:58.583 --> 37:01.185
I did not know that about you

37:01.252 --> 37:04.322
and I am so glad that you
have explained that to us.

37:04.388 --> 37:08.192

tries you over that (bleep)...

37:08.259 --> 37:09.694

make fun
