What's on tap, baby?

00:36.837 --> 00:37.336
Your favorite.

00:37.338 --> 00:40.906

00:54.221 --> 00:55.687
Scallops?! Hooray!

00:55.689 --> 00:57.656
It's his favorite.
I figured that out

00:57.658 --> 01:00.559
since we've had it
ten times this month.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.828
I'm gonna go toast
up my favorite:

01:02.830 --> 01:04.897
fish sticks
and Tater Tots.

01:04.899 --> 01:06.165
Honey, we're out of them.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.466

CLEVELAND:
What's on tap, baby?

01:18.712 --> 01:21.947
So, Cleveland Jr.,
are you all packed

01:21.949 --> 01:24.183
for your school trip to D.C.?

01:24.185 --> 01:25.851
I'm not going on that trip.

01:25.853 --> 01:26.652
Not going?

01:26.654 --> 01:29.588
This is your chance to
visit our nation's capital

01:29.590 --> 01:31.957
and see how white people
created our country

01:31.959 --> 01:34.760
with no help from
anybody else.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.629
I'm not going.

01:37.631 --> 01:38.630
Bye, Shamu.

01:38.632 --> 01:41.166
It's just that
Junior's never spent

01:41.168 --> 01:42.534
a night away
from his parents.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.870
Roberta, you going on
that trip, aren't you?

01:44.872 --> 01:46.438
No way I'm babysitting.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.174
Roberta, let me introduce you

01:49.176 --> 01:51.743
to some gentlemen of influence.

01:51.745 --> 01:56.748
Mr. Andrew Jackson

you know him as "The General"--

02:04.625 --> 02:07.426
Mr. George Washington.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.294
Forty-one dollars?

02:09.296 --> 02:12.297
$41 for keeping
an eye on my boy.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.532
Forty-one dollars.

02:13.534 --> 02:16.902
Hey, Junior, you ready
to have a good time

02:16.904 --> 02:19.338
in Washington
with your big sister

02:19.340 --> 02:20.639

02:20.641 --> 02:21.507
CLEVELAND JR.: Okay.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.408
All right.
Come on up here, Junior.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.477
Daddy, watch out!
Somebody put a lot of boogers

02:25.479 --> 02:28.614
under your part
of the table.
(clearing throat)

02:31.050 --> 02:32.584
Let's go, people.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.052
I want fannies
on the bus!

02:34.054 --> 02:36.655
Come on, fannies
on the bus!

02:41.928 --> 02:43.228
(sighs)

02:43.230 --> 02:45.597
Come on, little brother.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.833
Hey, Cleveland Jr.
What?

02:47.835 --> 02:50.102
Get bitches, man.

02:50.104 --> 02:52.704
(indistinct shouting)
Okay, zip it, lock it,

02:52.706 --> 02:54.039
put it in your pocket.

02:54.041 --> 02:55.941
This is Tim and Arianna,

02:55.943 --> 02:57.376
Raymond's mom and dad.

02:57.378 --> 03:00.579
That's, uh, that's Raymond,
right back there.

03:00.581 --> 03:01.880
Hello?

03:01.882 --> 03:03.382
Eh, you watch out,
pretty girls.

03:03.384 --> 03:06.718
He's, he's going to try
to kiss your face.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.087
Oh, that's a wonderful
message, Tim.

03:09.089 --> 03:11.190
Because kissing girls
is certainly

03:11.192 --> 03:13.392
going to get him
into Princeton University.

03:13.394 --> 03:14.993
They'll be your chaperones.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.362
They have the power
to give you demerits.

03:17.364 --> 03:20.499
I will take back that power
at the end of the trip.

03:20.501 --> 03:24.069
But until then, you will
treat them with respect.

03:24.071 --> 03:27.806
Remember, no iPods,
no carbonated beverages,

03:27.808 --> 03:29.641

Um, fast-forward.

03:44.992 --> 03:47.092
What?
Fast-forward
through the commercial.

03:47.094 --> 03:49.661
I'm not gonna fast-forward
through the commercial.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.730
Why not? That's why
we got a DVR.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.066
We got a DVR so
we could record

03:54.068 --> 03:56.101
the programs we
want to watch

03:56.103 --> 03:57.603
<i>with</i> he commercials.

Your generation
needs to calm down.

04:00.741 --> 04:01.974
Look, these ad
men are doing

04:01.976 --> 04:04.676
all sorts of research
on what we want to buy.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.712
Then they're putting
descriptions of the products

04:06.714 --> 04:09.681
on during the shows they
know we're gonna watch.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.650

04:43.951 --> 04:45.751
Yes, you see what
you made me do?

04:45.753 --> 04:47.886
You made me make
a freak out of that girl.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.989
I brought Daniel Boone hats
to wear for the bus ride.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.491
Sounds like fun.

sport he hasn't lettered in

05:05.906 --> 05:07.939
or a girl who
hasn't let him in.

05:07.941 --> 05:09.574
Give me your seats.

05:09.576 --> 05:11.777
Why was I whispering?
He's deaf.

05:11.779 --> 05:14.112
But I want to sit
close to my sister.

05:14.114 --> 05:16.982
It's not right
to separate a family.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.917
Tell him, Roberta.

05:20.386 --> 05:22.020
He's not my real brother.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.488
His dad married my mom.

05:23.490 --> 05:26.058
Nobody asked my permission.

05:26.225 --> 05:30.462
Well, well, well--
the plot thickens.

05:30.464 --> 05:33.298

chair, fatso.

05:38.339 --> 05:39.905
Rallo, be nice.

05:39.907 --> 05:42.441
Well, I'm tired of him
picking the menu,

05:42.443 --> 05:44.209
eating my fish sticks,

05:44.211 --> 05:45.444
sitting where
I used to sit,

05:45.446 --> 05:47.846
running around like
he owns the place.

05:47.848 --> 05:48.847
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.316
Is your name on the mortgage
of this house?

05:51.318 --> 05:52.484
No. Is yours?

05:52.486 --> 05:55.187
No, but that's just
a matter of paperwork.

05:55.189 --> 05:58.657
I have an appointment
with Len Stein later this week.

05:58.659 --> 05:59.524
Oh, he called back?

05:59.526 --> 06:01.326
Yeah, I made us
an appointment

06:01.328 --> 06:03.028
at 10:30 on Thursday.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.496
I got to work
on Thursday.

06:04.498 --> 06:05.964
Oh. You know
what I'll do?

06:05.966 --> 06:09.067
I'll get Len to overnight
us the signature copies.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.702
Hold on.

06:10.704 --> 06:14.339
Len? Hey, Cleveland
Brown here.

06:14.341 --> 06:15.474
Cleveland Brown?

06:15.476 --> 06:17.809
Donna Tubbs'
new husband.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.244
Yeah. How you doing?

06:19.246 --> 06:21.947
Listen, Donna won't be able
to make it on Thursday,

06:21.949 --> 06:25.016
so we were hoping you could
send us the signature pages

06:25.018 --> 06:27.552
of the inter-spousal
transfer of title form.

06:27.554 --> 06:31.223
I'm assuming they
need a real signature
and not a faxed copy?

06:31.225 --> 06:34.159
Right, yeah. Um, could
you just send them

06:34.161 --> 06:35.360
to us here
at the house?

06:35.362 --> 06:36.528
Yeah, that way
we'll sign them

06:36.530 --> 06:39.798
and I'll just make our
file copies at Kinkos.

06:39.800 --> 06:40.899
Hey, and while I'm there,

06:40.901 --> 06:43.235
I'll just overnight it
right back to you.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.170
Great!
Thanks, Len!

06:45.172 --> 06:49.708
Ask me Thursday at noon
if my name's on the mortgage.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.244
So I'm getting undressed,

06:52.246 --> 06:54.479
thinking he's running
the bath for me,

06:54.481 --> 06:57.249
only to walk in
and see his big ol' butt

06:57.251 --> 06:58.450
stepping into the tub.

06:58.452 --> 07:01.620
And believe me,
it was not a good angle.

07:01.622 --> 07:02.521
(grunts)

07:02.523 --> 07:04.489
Did you even get a bath?

07:04.491 --> 07:05.624
Hell, no.

07:05.626 --> 07:06.691
We was out of hot water.

07:06.693 --> 07:09.027
I had to take a whore's
bath at the sink.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.696
Oh, but I <i>am </i> clean,
m-most definitely clean.

07:11.698 --> 07:15.500
Sounds like he's not respecting
your position in the family.

07:15.502 --> 07:17.269
I'm the man of that house.

07:17.271 --> 07:18.804
So what are you
gonna do, Rallo?

07:18.806 --> 07:21.540
I'm gonna hit him
where it hurts: the dong.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.032

Move your
black crack, Jack.

07:50.370 --> 07:51.503

07:51.505 --> 07:52.671
Rallo had a nightmare.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.574
I'm far too scared
to sleep alone.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.242
You can sleep
with us tonight.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.010
CLEVELAND:
There's no room.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.780
Trust me, there's room

08:01.782 --> 08:03.081
- What?!
- Uh, uh,

08:03.083 --> 08:05.484
I said there's room
for "Clee" in this bed.

08:05.486 --> 08:07.285
You don't call me "Clee."

08:07.287 --> 08:08.620
Sure, I do.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.155
I love you, Clee.

08:10.157 --> 08:13.592
Oh, I love you, too, Dahn.

Oh, look who's
sitting at his spot

08:33.280 --> 08:35.680
at the head of the table.
(grumbling)

08:35.682 --> 08:37.148
Sleep well? I did.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.316
Like a baby.

08:38.318 --> 08:42.120
Like a baby nestled
against his mother's bosom.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.723
I should be the bosom-nestler.

08:44.725 --> 08:48.660
Mmm! This Danish is good.

Your junk is monumental.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.070
(all laughing)
Look at him.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.573
Tim, they're using
the Washington Monument

09:01.575 --> 09:03.308
now as their wang.

09:03.310 --> 09:06.311
Go stop them.
Okay, okay.

09:09.348 --> 09:10.348
No.
What?

09:10.350 --> 09:13.385
No, I-I'm not going
to tell them to stop.

09:13.387 --> 09:16.855
They're just kids having fun
like we used to have.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.290
Oh, what happened to us?

09:18.292 --> 09:21.326
What happened to the free spirit
I fell in love with

09:21.328 --> 09:24.629
who, who used to zip
around town on her Vespa

09:24.631 --> 09:27.432
like a giant Audrey Hepburn?

09:27.434 --> 09:29.601
You're right.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.336
I've become a nag.

09:31.338 --> 09:34.639
A horrible, whining,
repetitive nag.

09:34.641 --> 09:36.575
Th-Th-That's
all I'm saying.

09:36.577 --> 09:39.210
W-We, we, we need
to do something crazy.

09:39.212 --> 09:40.845
We need
a game-changer tonight!

09:40.847 --> 09:44.783
Yes, yes, let's get
tattoos and eat falafel.

09:44.785 --> 09:47.852
Oh, Arianna,
where have you been?

09:47.854 --> 09:49.721
Right in front of you.

09:49.723 --> 09:50.655
(pleasurable moaning)

09:50.657 --> 09:55.060
OLIVER:
Wow, everybody's
hooking up on this trip.

09:57.797 --> 09:59.764
Oh, is this yours?

09:59.766 --> 10:02.233
I'm gonna need
a closer look.

10:02.235 --> 10:03.201
Oh, man.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.503
You wouldn't believe
the horrifying

10:05.505 --> 10:07.806
and terrifying
nightmare I had.

10:07.808 --> 10:11.076
Another nightmare?
Mm-hmm.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.110
Oh, you poor thing.

10:12.112 --> 10:15.580
Don't you see he's just
tricking you into babying him?

10:15.582 --> 10:17.515
Cleveland, he's
a little boy.

10:17.517 --> 10:19.250
Let him get used
to our new family.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.586
But he doesn't need
to sleep in our bed.

10:21.588 --> 10:24.289
That's where we do things
to each other.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.690
Dirty things.

10:25.692 --> 10:27.492
Disrespectful things.

10:27.494 --> 10:28.827
Things that make it
hard for me

10:28.829 --> 10:31.429
to look you in the eye
the next day.

10:31.431 --> 10:35.200
Your sweet talk is not
going to work on me tonight.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.901
RALLO:
Mama, I'm cold.

10:36.903 --> 10:38.837
Come back to bed.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.438
Cleveland, he's five.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.807
Exactly.
Let's just go for it.

10:42.809 --> 10:43.875
He won't know
what we're doing.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.844
He'll think
we're wrestling.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.446
Doggy wrestling.

10:48.448 --> 10:51.249
(Ernie snoring,
muffled bass beats)

10:53.786 --> 10:56.254
(hiphop playing)

10:56.922 --> 10:59.658
(laughter)

10:59.660 --> 11:01.793
(laughing):
Sweet jammies.

11:01.795 --> 11:04.796
Thanks, they're also
flame retardant.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.398
Excuse me, Roberta?

11:06.400 --> 11:07.565
What do you want?

11:07.567 --> 11:09.534
I need you
to do me a favor.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.503
Um, check
under my bed for...

11:11.505 --> 11:12.671
(clearing throat):
...monsters.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.706
Cleveland Jr., get out of here.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.142
You're too old to be
believing in monsters.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.843
Well, I know that
intellectually,

11:18.845 --> 11:21.613
but phobias are not
always rational.

11:21.615 --> 11:23.281
That's what makes them so--

11:23.283 --> 11:24.783
(roaring)
(screaming)

11:24.785 --> 11:27.252
(all laughing)

11:31.857 --> 11:34.192
Cleveland, can you
dry this for me?

11:34.194 --> 11:37.162
Why don't you have
your boyfriend Rallo do it?

11:37.164 --> 11:38.396
Please, Cleveland.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.232
He's my son and he's
adjusting as best he can.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.967
But we promised
in our wedding vows

11:42.969 --> 11:45.537
that we would have sex
every night.

11:45.539 --> 11:48.206
What?
No-no, we didn't.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.941
It was implied.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.609
Look, I'm serious.

11:51.611 --> 11:54.846
Donna, this has been
going on too long.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.414
I'm your husband.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.950
All right, all
right, fine.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.852
I'll talk to
him tonight.

12:00.854 --> 12:01.419
Good.

12:01.421 --> 12:05.390
Oh, to be a fly on the wall
for that conversation.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.959
Oh, this is gonna be good.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.061
Hey, what's that awful smell?

12:10.063 --> 12:11.996
Oh, it's on my little
hand-things.

12:11.998 --> 12:13.064
Is that--?

12:13.066 --> 12:14.599
(sniffs)
Oh, gross.

12:14.601 --> 12:18.737
Oh, now why would I land
on a steaming pile of--?

12:22.341 --> 12:24.509
All right, here's your pizza,
your banana split

12:24.511 --> 12:27.278
and your milkshake,
served with a crazy straw

12:27.280 --> 12:28.646
and crazy napkin--

12:28.648 --> 12:31.850
designed by our crazy chef
Nick Nolte.

12:31.852 --> 12:35.854
(muttering)

12:35.856 --> 12:36.855
You know what, Mama?

12:36.857 --> 12:39.758
The more time I spend with you,
the more I like you.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.693
You can't say that
about most women.

12:41.695 --> 12:45.497
Rallo, baby, there's something
we need to talk about.

12:45.499 --> 12:47.699
I love you,
but Mama's married now.

12:47.701 --> 12:50.702
And a husband and a wife have
a room with their bed,

12:50.704 --> 12:53.204
and a child has
a room with his bed.

12:53.206 --> 12:56.441
Oh, so all of a sudden
I'm a "child"?

12:56.443 --> 12:59.310
No, you're a young man,
and a young man...

12:59.312 --> 13:01.579
Don't you patronize me, lady.

13:01.581 --> 13:02.580
Rallo, please.

13:02.582 --> 13:03.715
People are beginning to stare.

13:03.717 --> 13:06.351
Well, let's give them
something to stare at.

13:06.353 --> 13:09.187
This woman
broke my heart.

13:09.855 --> 13:10.822
Uh, excuse me.

13:10.824 --> 13:13.358
I'm taking
a child psychology course

13:13.360 --> 13:14.659
at the community college.

13:14.661 --> 13:17.328
Maybe I can help you guys
work this out?

13:17.330 --> 13:19.030
You can try.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.298
(loud slaps)

13:20.300 --> 13:22.000
Listen to your mother!

13:22.002 --> 13:24.435
Okay, that'll be two tokens.

13:24.437 --> 13:28.006
Send a woman to do
your dirty work.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.908
How do you sleep
at night?

13:29.910 --> 13:31.976
Butt naked, next to your mama.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.712
(high-pitched laugh)

13:35.881 --> 13:39.384
I can't believe we're stuck in
this motel for another night.

13:39.386 --> 13:42.086
Nothing exciting has ever
happened in a D.C. hotel.

13:42.088 --> 13:47.025
Didn't Marion Barry get caught
smoking crack at a D.C. hotel?

13:47.027 --> 13:48.893
Okay, yeah,
but besides that.

13:48.895 --> 13:52.931
Didn't Reagan get
shot at a D.C. hotel?

13:52.933 --> 13:53.865
Besides that.

13:53.867 --> 13:56.568
Watergate happened at
a hotel, I know that.

13:56.570 --> 13:57.902
(stammering):
I know, I know.

13:57.904 --> 13:59.771
And didn't Elliot Spitzer...?

13:59.773 --> 14:00.672
O-Okay, whatever.

14:00.674 --> 14:04.576
The point is, we need to go out
and find a party.

14:04.578 --> 14:06.678
Hey, guys, I got an idea.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.914
We need to go out
to find a party.

14:09.916 --> 14:11.115
Yo, Oliver's right.

14:11.117 --> 14:13.151
There are so many bomb spots
out there

14:13.153 --> 14:15.620
where I could get the crowd
jumping with my demo.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.388
There's a fat beat on top of it.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.556
I'm going, like--

14:18.558 --> 14:21.993
(beatboxing):
♪ Ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh

14:21.995 --> 14:24.028
♪ Ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh...

14:24.030 --> 14:24.963
Then I go:

14:24.965 --> 14:28.900
♪ Federline, Federline Jones.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.368
It's hot, y'all.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.035
Peace.

14:31.037 --> 14:35.573
(Tim laughing and shushing)

14:35.575 --> 14:41.246
Our marriage no longer feels
like a death sentence!

14:44.683 --> 14:47.485
(boys laughing
and shushing)

14:48.988 --> 14:50.822
Where's Roberta?

14:50.824 --> 14:55.493
Last I saw, she was with
Federline at this party.

14:57.930 --> 15:03.735
He played his demo and they
beat the crap out of him.

15:04.436 --> 15:07.138
Mr. Tim, uh, sorry to wake you,

15:07.140 --> 15:10.642
but I think Roberta might
be in trouble.

15:10.644 --> 15:12.110
Hello?

15:12.112 --> 15:13.745
Is anybody there?

15:14.513 --> 15:16.981
TIM:
Oh, yes.
Oh, Tim, you're so naughty.

15:16.983 --> 15:20.652
- Oh, Yes! Yes! Yes!
- That tickles.

15:20.654 --> 15:22.053
Oh, yes, Tim! Oh, yes!

15:22.055 --> 15:26.858
(both roaring)

15:31.764 --> 15:32.964
(siren wailing)

15:32.966 --> 15:37.602
Which direction is
the club Roberta's at?

15:40.639 --> 15:44.042
(gunshots)

15:46.946 --> 15:51.015
Donna, guess what's
wearing my watch.

15:51.017 --> 15:53.952
Hope it's waterproof.

15:53.954 --> 15:57.055
(both laughing)

16:04.096 --> 16:07.131
Uh... oh...

16:07.133 --> 16:08.733
(screaming)

16:08.735 --> 16:11.536
Ow, ow, oh!
Rallo!

16:11.538 --> 16:13.504
Ow, oh, ow!

16:13.506 --> 16:16.074
(sobbing)

16:18.877 --> 16:22.113
Oh, baby, Mama's so sorry.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.848
It's his fault.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.883
He made me break my leg.

16:25.885 --> 16:29.387
And he ate my Tater Tots
and my fish sticks.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.089
And he sat in my chair.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.858
And he called me the N-word.

16:33.860 --> 16:37.061
Wha-- I'm allowed to, right?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.001
I usually make a left
to go to the bathroom

16:43.003 --> 16:45.470
when I'm in your room,
but I was in my room

16:45.472 --> 16:48.806
where it was all dark and scary
and I got turned around.

16:48.808 --> 16:50.641
I didn't know
which way to go.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.210
We're so sorry.
Aren't we, Cleveland?

16:52.212 --> 16:55.913
Oh, why? 'Cause he doesn't
know his left from his right?

16:55.915 --> 16:57.181
What's wrong with you?

16:57.183 --> 16:58.716
My loins ache.

16:58.718 --> 16:59.851
I'm so sorry, Rallo.

16:59.853 --> 17:03.721
You can sleep in our bed
as long as you need to.

17:03.723 --> 17:04.489
What?!

17:04.491 --> 17:07.291
Oh, man, this kid is worse
than people who don't recycle.

17:07.293 --> 17:10.928
Hi, I'm Cleveland Brown,
reminding you to recycle.

17:10.930 --> 17:16.634
It's great for the environment,
and it only takes a second.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.069
Aw, it's wet.

17:18.071 --> 17:19.003
Is that milk?

17:19.005 --> 17:20.772
(sniffs)
Aw, it's beer.

17:20.774 --> 17:23.141
Oh, oh, this whole bag stinks.

17:23.143 --> 17:26.244
Aw, you know what,
(bleep) this.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.046
It's all trash to me.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.047
Y'all recycle.

17:29.049 --> 17:33.017
I'm gonna go wash
my (bleep) hands.

17:34.186 --> 17:36.120
Drugs here.

17:36.122 --> 17:37.555
Get your drugs here.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.923
Ice cold drugs.

17:38.925 --> 17:40.958
(deep male voice):
You boys want to party?

17:40.960 --> 17:42.927
What, like a pizza party?

17:42.929 --> 17:44.529
Let me rephrase that.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.631
You want to see my vageenis?

17:46.633 --> 17:47.632
No, thank you.

17:47.634 --> 17:50.668
But do you know
where this club is?

17:50.670 --> 17:51.602
Yeah, baby.

17:51.604 --> 17:54.806
Go to the end of this street,
then two blocks to the right.

17:54.808 --> 17:58.209
If you pass the corpse in the
alley, you've gone too far.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.611
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, ma'am.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.082
(lively party sounds)

18:05.717 --> 18:08.586
How would you like to be
seen by two million people?

18:08.588 --> 18:09.587
Really?

18:09.589 --> 18:11.656
Yeah, take off your shirt.

18:11.658 --> 18:12.290
What?!
Come on,

18:12.292 --> 18:14.959
we'll give you
a free hat.

18:14.961 --> 18:16.828
(cheering)

18:18.397 --> 18:21.532
No-- I don't think--
I'm not-- uh...

18:21.534 --> 18:24.202
CLEVELAND JR.:
You want to see
a pair of boobs?

18:24.204 --> 18:26.170
Check these out.

18:26.172 --> 18:28.940
Check out the
fat chick.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.741
(hiphop playing)

18:30.743 --> 18:32.710
Roberta, I'm here
to rescue you,

18:32.712 --> 18:36.948
like Luke did for his sister
Princess Leia in <i>Star Wars.</i>

18:36.950 --> 18:38.116
And like Anakin did
for Padme

18:38.118 --> 18:41.652
<i>in Star Wars, Episode Two:</i>
<i>Attack of the Clones,</i>

18:41.654 --> 18:43.287
which unlike the
three original films,

18:43.289 --> 18:47.191
did not seem to take place
in an authentic environment.

18:47.193 --> 18:49.627
You came to save me.

18:49.629 --> 18:50.761
Thank you,
little brother.

18:50.763 --> 18:53.364
But how are we gonna
get out of here?

18:53.366 --> 18:55.066
Like this.

18:55.701 --> 18:57.835
That's right.
I'm a boy.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.237
(screeching)

19:06.645 --> 19:10.715
All I want is to sleep
in the same bed as my wife.

19:10.717 --> 19:13.751
But it's not just about
the bedroom, Rallo.

19:13.753 --> 19:17.054
I married your mother
because I love her very much,

19:17.056 --> 19:20.658
and we are now trying to build
a new life for all of us.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.960
So, what do you say?
No.

19:22.962 --> 19:26.197
What?! But I'm offering you
the head of the table,

19:26.199 --> 19:28.099
the newspaper...
I said no.

19:28.101 --> 19:29.300
The remote,
the first bath...

19:29.302 --> 19:31.903
I love her, too,
and she's mine.

19:31.905 --> 19:34.272
And where I come from,
you don't share a woman.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.406
Rallo, you're not being...

19:35.408 --> 19:38.776
Look, old man, I broke
one leg to get what I want.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.478
Don't think I won't
break another one.

19:40.480 --> 19:44.415
Oh, you-you broke your leg
on purpose?

19:44.417 --> 19:46.984
You-- you're crazy!

19:46.986 --> 19:49.520
(gasps)

19:51.190 --> 19:53.624
What are we gonna read
tonight, sugar?

19:53.626 --> 19:55.026
<i>How about</i>
<i>Thomas the Tank Engine?</i>

19:55.028 --> 19:58.362
I'm sorry, baby, Mama's
not feeling too good.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.364
I'm going to sleep.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.767
Good night, Cleveland.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.938
(sighs)

20:08.040 --> 20:11.943
Aw, Sir Thomas,
she's laying here with me,

20:11.945 --> 20:13.377
but she's thinking about him.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.313
I don't mind torturing
Old Brown,

20:15.315 --> 20:19.317
but I cannot bear
to see my mama in pain.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.419
Well, as Kobe Bryant once said,

20:21.421 --> 20:25.990
"I have overstayed
my welcome in this bed."

20:25.992 --> 20:27.525
(snoring)

20:27.527 --> 20:30.027
Hey, old man,
we need to talk.

20:30.029 --> 20:31.262
Wake up!
(screams)
What the...?!

20:31.264 --> 20:35.366
I'll take that deal if
it's still on the tab--

20:35.368 --> 20:36.834
DONNA:
Oh, Clee!

20:36.836 --> 20:37.935
Oh, Dahn!

20:37.937 --> 20:42.240
<i>♪ Whenever you call me</i>
<i>I'll be there ♪</i>

20:42.242 --> 20:46.377
<i>♪ Whenver you want me</i>
<i>I'll be there ♪</i>

20:46.379 --> 20:50.881
<i>♪ Whenever you need me</i>
<i>I'll be there ♪</i>

20:50.883 --> 20:51.916
<i>♪ I'll be around</i>

20:51.918 --> 20:54.352
The crown is heavy, but
somebody's got to wear it.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.954
Yeah, you got a fish stick
and a remote control.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.056
Have fun living
with that pin in your leg

20:59.058 --> 21:01.659
for the rest of your life.
