WEBVTT

00:09.042 --> 00:09.976
Well, it's official.

00:10.410 --> 00:12.979
Once again, there is no room for me

00:12.979 --> 00:15.482
at the Yo-Yo Ma
Orchestral Fantasy Camp.

00:15.482 --> 00:17.417
Hello.

00:17.817 --> 00:20.387
Frasier, this is
my cousin, Jen.

00:20.387 --> 00:21.388
She's visiting
this week, remember?

00:21.388 --> 00:22.589
Oh, yes.

00:22.856 --> 00:23.923
Of course. So, how are you
enjoying Seattle?

00:24.424 --> 00:25.191
Well...

00:25.392 --> 00:26.960
I've been
living in London,

00:26.960 --> 00:28.962
so Seattle seems
a little lame.

00:28.962 --> 00:29.863
No offense.

00:30.196 --> 00:31.264
Oh, none taken.

00:31.264 --> 00:32.098
So you like London?

00:32.365 --> 00:33.933
Not really.

00:33.933 --> 00:35.835
It's like a parody
of itself.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.270
How so?
Oh, you know,

00:37.704 --> 00:38.772
double-decker buses...
Ah
...

00:38.772 --> 00:40.774
Bobbies, little pubs...

00:40.774 --> 00:43.276
It's like Epcot,
but even fakier.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.111
So I bailed.

00:45.378 --> 00:46.946
Went and spent some
time in Florence.

00:46.946 --> 00:47.781
Ah
...

00:48.014 --> 00:49.582
Firenze.
How is she?

00:49.582 --> 00:50.884
I got to say...

00:51.084 --> 00:52.485
Florence is over.

00:53.953 --> 00:55.021
It was probably cool

00:55.021 --> 00:56.923
before all the Americans
found out about it.

00:57.257 --> 00:59.125
You mean 300 years ago?

00:59.392 --> 01:00.460
Exactly.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.262
That's why
I'm going to Vietnam.

01:02.529 --> 01:05.432
Americans have never
even heard of it.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.300
Ah.
Well, you know, I'm afraid

01:07.300 --> 01:08.802
I have to bail
on this conversation.

01:09.302 --> 01:10.303
I have a show to prepare for.

01:10.303 --> 01:12.272
Uh, Roz, when are we doing
those promos this evening?

01:12.705 --> 01:13.773
Oh, I had
to reschedule those

01:13.773 --> 01:16.209
'cause Jen and I
are going out tonight.

01:16.209 --> 01:18.611
A guy I met on the Internet
is in this band.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.480
We're going to go check them
out, have some drinks

01:20.914 --> 01:21.981
watch all the losers.

01:21.981 --> 01:23.983
Want to come?

01:24.417 --> 01:26.986
While no stranger
to the discotheque

01:26.986 --> 01:29.322
I'm afraid it'll just have to
be you and Roz this evening.

01:29.622 --> 01:31.191
This is our first time going out

01:31.191 --> 01:32.692
since I was a kid.

01:32.692 --> 01:34.194
When she used to baby-sit
me

01:34.194 --> 01:36.696
she was always dragging
me on some wild adventure.

01:36.696 --> 01:38.198
Like that time
we changed that sign

01:38.698 --> 01:40.667
from "School Assembly" to "cool ass."

01:40.667 --> 01:42.168
Ah
...
(chuckles)

01:42.569 --> 01:43.636
Charming.

01:43.636 --> 01:45.038
JEN:
No, you don't understand.

01:45.438 --> 01:48.508
The town we grew up in
was totally boring.

01:48.508 --> 01:49.943
It was like
Kill Yourself, USA, right?

01:51.511 --> 01:54.080
Roz was the only person who did anything fun.

01:54.514 --> 01:55.882
Is that so?
Yeah.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.183
My mom calls me Roz Junior

01:57.684 --> 01:59.686
which is what passes for
wit where we come from.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.089
And our town has the world's..

02:03.423 --> 02:06.960
...fourth largest
thermometer.
Fourth largest thermometer.

02:07.327 --> 02:09.696
Yes, well...

02:11.064 --> 02:13.066
I can see why London
really let you down.

02:14.901 --> 02:16.436
Hey, Doc.
Hi, Kenny.

02:16.936 --> 02:18.938
Remember last month when
you spent your whole show

02:18.938 --> 02:20.940
talking to that
pregnant teenager?
Yes.

02:20.940 --> 02:22.742
Well, it wasn't
a total waste.

02:23.042 --> 02:24.611
We just got nominated

02:24.611 --> 02:27.113
for an Excellence in
Broadcasting Decency award.

02:27.113 --> 02:28.047
Really?

02:28.515 --> 02:30.083
Well, that is quite an honor.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.551
I don't think we've ever
won one of those.

02:31.551 --> 02:33.520
It's a very
prestigious award.

02:33.887 --> 02:37.957
That's what makes it so special when
they call your name.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.326
You know, it's heavier
than it looks.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.730
You don't want to drop
one of those

02:45.365 --> 02:46.332
So you've won one?
Yeah

02:46.666 --> 02:48.735
It's in a box in my office.
You can come by sometime

02:48.735 --> 02:49.669
and I'll show you.
Honestly, Kenny,

02:50.036 --> 02:51.604
when are you going to unpack
those boxes?

02:51.604 --> 02:53.606
Isn't four years enough time
to make that office your own?

02:54.007 --> 02:55.074
Negatory, Doc.

02:55.074 --> 02:57.510
Every time I unpack
in a new job, I get fired--

02:57.877 --> 02:59.946
Tacoma, Moline...

02:59.946 --> 03:02.448
Moline again.

03:02.448 --> 03:04.751
I learned my lesson.
Those boxes stay packed.

03:05.084 --> 03:06.653
So that's why
you haven't unpacked.

03:06.653 --> 03:09.155
You know, all this time I
been using you on my radio show

03:09.155 --> 03:11.658
as an example
of procrastination.

03:11.658 --> 03:13.459
I had no idea
you were just living in fear.

03:15.261 --> 03:17.263
I prefer to see it as
a healthy superstition.

03:17.664 --> 03:19.732
Kenny, there's no such thing
as a healthy superstition.

03:19.732 --> 03:20.567
Oh, yeah?

03:20.867 --> 03:22.435
What do you call
washing your hands

03:22.435 --> 03:23.436
after you go to the bathroom?

03:30.510 --> 03:32.045
(sportscast playing)

03:32.045 --> 03:33.046
Ugh.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.814
Look at this place.

03:35.014 --> 03:37.050
Dad, I don't believe you've
thrown out a single newspaper

03:37.050 --> 03:38.551
since Daphne
moved in with Niles.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.553
Hey, it was your idea
to split up the chores

03:40.553 --> 03:42.589
Recycling is your deal

03:42.589 --> 03:45.391
Recycling and
floors, remember?

03:45.658 --> 03:49.229
I'm in charge of regular garbage and tabletops.

03:49.229 --> 03:52.232
Both of which are nicely
under control, I might add.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.666
Really?

03:53.666 --> 03:55.235
I count three snack plates
around your chair.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.136
All of them on tabletops.

03:57.503 --> 03:58.571
Ah.

04:04.811 --> 04:06.679
Not anymore.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.982
All right.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.483
What's it going to take for you

04:10.483 --> 04:12.385
to start doing your share
of the work around here?

04:13.786 --> 04:17.624
Trade me... floors for garbage.

04:17.857 --> 04:19.425
You'll really take care
of all the floors

04:19.926 --> 04:20.827
if I handle the garbage?

04:21.194 --> 04:21.761
That's right.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.029
(doorbell rings)

04:25.765 --> 04:26.766
Okay.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.271
Okay.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.773
You got a deal, mister.

04:33.773 --> 04:34.774
Hi, Daph.

04:34.774 --> 04:35.775
Hello.

04:36.342 --> 04:38.278
Why is all your garbage
stacked up in the hallway?

04:40.713 --> 04:43.683
That's right,
why is that, Frasier?

04:45.618 --> 04:48.021
Your game is deep.

04:48.388 --> 04:50.957
My, things are a bit untidy
around here, aren't they?

04:51.457 --> 04:53.960
Maybe I'll just clean up the
dishes before we get started.

04:53.960 --> 04:54.961
Daphne, you don't
have to do that.

04:55.461 --> 04:58.231
That's true, you're not our slave anymore.

04:58.431 --> 05:01.000
I'm not going to do all of it.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.435
Just the tabletops.

05:02.902 --> 05:04.971
Oh, that's sweet of you.

05:09.575 --> 05:12.011
Burn.

05:15.848 --> 05:16.883
No, no...

05:16.883 --> 05:18.685
Well, there's room
at Roz's table.

05:18.951 --> 05:19.986
No.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.021
Jen
I find her cousin

05:22.488 --> 05:26.025
just a bit judgmental for my tastes.

05:26.025 --> 05:29.028
Yesterday she told me that
my show was bourgeois.

05:29.028 --> 05:31.030
I pointed out that anything
that had mass appeal

05:31.531 --> 05:33.032
could be called bourgeois.

05:33.032 --> 05:35.535
She then said my argument was bourgeois.

05:35.535 --> 05:38.037
Which I found to be jejune

05:40.006 --> 05:42.008
People in their 20s
are always like that.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.010
Hmm.
The world's so daunting
at that age.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.012
They comfort themselves
with the idea

05:46.012 --> 05:47.008
that everything's just trash.

05:47.613 --> 05:49.682
We were like that
in medical school--

05:49.682 --> 05:51.684
acting as if we were
above it all...

05:51.684 --> 05:54.687
(chuckles)
Smarter than everybody.

05:54.687 --> 05:55.621
It passes.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.092
Hello, Roz

05:59.092 --> 06:00.526
Niles, Frasier.

06:00.526 --> 06:01.594
Hi, Roz.
Come join us.

06:02.061 --> 06:02.995
Thank you
Jen, this is Niles.

06:03.296 --> 06:04.864
Nice to meet you.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.866
"Niles." Whoa.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.236
"Thanks, Mom
and Dad," right?

06:10.503 --> 06:11.537
(lightly chuckles)

06:11.537 --> 06:12.872
FRASIER:
Well, Jen...

06:13.106 --> 06:14.173
good to see you again.

06:14.173 --> 06:17.176
Ah, so how was
our night out, girls?

06:17.176 --> 06:20.546
Well, it's
still going on.

06:20.947 --> 06:23.783
We went to this really
great club called Zoo.

06:23.983 --> 06:25.051
Excuse me, The Zoo?

06:25.051 --> 06:26.486
No, it was
just called Zoo.

06:26.886 --> 06:27.954
And their...
"The."

06:28.388 --> 06:30.390
(laughs)

06:33.393 --> 06:34.894
Roz...

06:35.395 --> 06:37.397
is that glitter in your hair?

06:37.397 --> 06:38.398
Oh, is it?

06:38.831 --> 06:41.234
I thought it all came out
in the car wash.

06:43.469 --> 06:44.537
(cell phone rings)

06:44.537 --> 06:45.538
Oh, that's mine.

06:45.538 --> 06:46.539
Oh...

06:46.539 --> 06:47.440
Hello?

06:47.740 --> 06:50.309
Oh, Anka, you'll never guess

06:50.309 --> 06:54.147
what huge Seattle clich￩
I'm in right now.

06:54.380 --> 06:58.451
I swear, my cousin Roz is like,
the only cool person

06:58.451 --> 06:59.752
in this whole city.

06:59.986 --> 07:01.320
The rest are just drones.

07:01.521 --> 07:03.356
Apparently they don't believe in raw sugar.

07:03.556 --> 07:05.625
Excuse me.

07:05.625 --> 07:07.427
You see what I mean about her.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.263
She's struggling through
a typical phase of development.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.230
Stop being so sensitive.

07:11.564 --> 07:12.131
Hmm...

07:12.598 --> 07:13.599
Sorry about that.

07:13.599 --> 07:14.634
Not at all

07:14.634 --> 07:16.636
So... tell me about you guys.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.538
Roz says
you're super competitive

07:18.871 --> 07:19.939
with each other.
Did your parents

07:20.373 --> 07:23.443
withhold affection or is it
just a penis thing?

07:24.944 --> 07:26.946
Uh, I'll take
mine to go, thank you

07:31.651 --> 07:32.585
Coming up next...

07:32.585 --> 07:35.621
"This Day in
Psychological History,"

07:36.155 --> 07:36.956
after the news.

07:37.223 --> 07:37.790
(yawns)

07:38.291 --> 07:40.293
That was a good show,
Frasier.

07:40.793 --> 07:43.095
It's not over, Roz.
This is just a break.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.965
I'm sorry, I'm so exhausted.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.433
I haven't slept
since Jen got here.

07:47.900 --> 07:48.968
Hey, Roz, you want to go

07:48.968 --> 07:50.770
see some backyard
wrestling tonight?

07:51.037 --> 07:51.971
ROZ:
I don't know.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.373
Maybe we should stay in tonight
and rent a video.

07:54.373 --> 07:55.842
Rent a video?

07:56.242 --> 07:58.811
You're turning into
Aunt Maribelle.

07:58.811 --> 08:01.781
All you need is a beanbag
ashtray and a tracheotomy.

08:04.984 --> 08:07.487
Well, I'm not there yet.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.490
I just thought that maybe
you could use a night off.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.424
Say, Jen

08:11.757 --> 08:12.825
did you have a chance to explore

08:12.825 --> 08:14.327
that art gallery I suggested?

08:14.327 --> 08:15.261
Yeah.

08:15.595 --> 08:16.662
I know you're into that stuff

08:16.662 --> 08:17.997
so I don't want to put it down

08:18.264 --> 08:19.765
But it was like
everything in there

08:20.132 --> 08:22.168
was trying to make us
feel better about our corrupt,

08:22.168 --> 08:26.005
imperialistic,
phallocratic heritage.

08:27.306 --> 08:28.808
They're landscapes.

08:31.410 --> 08:33.980
But I picked up something for you
on the way over here.

08:33.980 --> 08:34.947
Really?
Mm-hmm.

08:34.947 --> 08:36.482
Well...

08:36.482 --> 08:38.284
Oh.

08:38.484 --> 08:41.988
A bust of Freud.

08:42.321 --> 08:43.890
Wow, that's really quite thoughtful of you.

08:43.890 --> 08:47.693
I figured you'd
appreciate the irony.

08:47.927 --> 08:52.732
Since he's been proven wrong
about practically everything.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.200
I like to think
that Freud's theories

08:54.200 --> 08:56.235
will stand the test of time.

08:56.235 --> 08:57.069
Really?

08:57.370 --> 08:59.939
Have you read either of his books?

09:00.339 --> 09:02.742
Excuse me, young lady...

09:03.009 --> 09:05.077
Uh-oh,
here comes the lecture.

09:05.077 --> 09:06.078
Yes.

09:06.078 --> 09:08.080
For once,
you are right.

09:08.080 --> 09:11.017
A disquisition
is indeed at hand.

09:11.350 --> 09:13.920
And may I suggest
that you roll your eyes

09:13.920 --> 09:16.422
back into the forward
position...

09:18.558 --> 09:21.127
...as I may actually employ
some visual aids.

09:21.127 --> 09:24.063
Now our story begins
with a young Greek woman

09:24.063 --> 09:26.065
by the name of Clytemnestra...

09:27.633 --> 09:29.502
Look, everybody,
Kenny's here.

09:29.835 --> 09:32.738
Wow, I've never
heard that before.

09:32.972 --> 09:35.875
Jen, maybe Kenny can show you around the station

09:36.142 --> 09:38.210
You already showed me around
the station yesterday.

09:38.644 --> 09:39.712
I know, but you know what?

09:39.712 --> 09:41.714
I totally forgot to show you
our ratings binders.

09:42.214 --> 09:43.215
You did?
Yeah.

09:43.215 --> 09:44.717
Well, you're in
for a treat.

09:45.151 --> 09:46.185
Here, follow me.

09:46.552 --> 09:47.587
What's that trophy for?

09:47.587 --> 09:50.623
Oh, a little series I produced called

09:50.623 --> 09:53.626
"Life Is My Favorite
Drug Of All."

09:54.026 --> 09:55.461
Sounds pretty lame.

09:56.829 --> 09:58.264
Yeah, it was.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.602
All right, that girl's really getting under my skin.

10:03.102 --> 10:03.970
When is she leaving?

10:04.236 --> 10:05.771
She's not that bad.
Oh, come on, Roz.

10:06.205 --> 10:07.273
She's running you ragged

10:07.707 --> 10:09.275
Oh, please.
This is nothing.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.776
I used to party every night.

10:10.776 --> 10:11.777
Well, sure

10:11.777 --> 10:13.613
At 20, you can do anything.

10:13.879 --> 10:18.250
Hey, there's still a lot
of candy left in this pinata.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.952
That's attractive.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.520
Thank you.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.022
Oh...

10:25.524 --> 10:27.526
And this is my office.

10:27.526 --> 10:30.029
The nerve center.

10:30.029 --> 10:32.431
Where it all goes down

10:34.367 --> 10:37.236
Did you just move in here
or something?

10:37.536 --> 10:39.605
Oh, no, no, but
in AM radio, you got to be

10:40.106 --> 10:41.607
ready to go
at a moment's notice.

10:41.607 --> 10:42.875
One day you're operating

10:43.075 --> 10:45.144
a 50,000-watt powerhouse
in Cleveland,

10:45.144 --> 10:47.146
the next
you're spinning platters

10:47.146 --> 10:49.048
out of a barn in Tulsa town.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.850
But you got to keep moving

10:51.217 --> 10:54.286
It's all about the music

10:54.286 --> 10:57.556
When it isn't about news
and talk.

10:57.757 --> 10:59.158
I heard AM radio's dead.

10:59.458 --> 11:00.493
Yeah, it is.

11:00.926 --> 11:03.496
So you're going to Vietnam?

11:03.496 --> 11:05.498
I'm thinking about it.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.899
.
That's such an original choice

11:07.266 --> 11:08.734
You're so cool.

11:08.734 --> 11:10.803
ly
You're the first person who hasn't
thought I was total

11:10.803 --> 11:12.238
crazy for wanting
to go there.
Oh

11:12.571 --> 11:13.639
What do they know?

11:13.639 --> 11:15.641
I've always loved the
idea of just taking off.

11:15.641 --> 11:17.576
You know, seeing someplace exotic.

11:17.943 --> 11:18.911
Why haven't you?

11:19.245 --> 11:21.113
My wife,
she didn't like to travel.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.882
But you just said
you were separated.

11:23.282 --> 11:24.617
So do it.

11:24.817 --> 11:27.386
Blow it all off, go see Vietnam.

11:27.386 --> 11:29.789
Break out of this prison cell.

11:30.122 --> 11:32.692
I could, couldn't I?

11:32.692 --> 11:34.193
You know,
and I could just be free.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.696
Get a motorcycle, drive around the countryside

11:36.696 --> 11:37.997
and really start to live.

11:38.264 --> 11:40.332
I never even thought
about the motorcycle.

11:40.332 --> 11:41.767
Now you have to do it.

11:42.134 --> 11:45.171
People would think I was nuts.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.106
I wouldn't.

11:50.376 --> 11:53.946
...when Freud's genius
has obviously influenced

11:54.447 --> 11:57.249
every psychiatrist
on the planet.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.056
I haven't forgotten
about your calls.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.559
Stay tuned, won't you?

12:11.564 --> 12:12.565
I'm starting to feel
a little bad

12:12.565 --> 12:15.000
about pawning Jen off
on Kenny like that.

12:15.334 --> 12:16.902
He's been a little down lately

12:16.902 --> 12:20.873
And Jen can be a little...
well, negative sometimes.

12:22.875 --> 12:25.311
I hadn't noticed.

12:25.678 --> 12:27.747
I just hope she doesn't
send him spiraling down

12:28.247 --> 12:30.583
into some kind
of depression.

12:35.387 --> 12:36.889
(pants)

12:42.294 --> 12:46.165
So Seattle still
loves the Walkman, huh?

12:46.365 --> 12:48.768
He's probably listening
to Thriller.

12:49.034 --> 12:50.102
So, do you still
want to go

12:50.102 --> 12:51.971
to that warehouse
party tonight?

12:52.238 --> 12:53.305
Doors open at 11:00

12:53.305 --> 12:54.707
so we should probably
be there at 1:00.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.609
Look, I wish I could, Jen.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.410
But I really have to sleep.

12:58.644 --> 13:00.212
Don't worry.

13:00.212 --> 13:01.714
.
We'll have a few cocktails
and you'll feel a lot better

13:02.214 --> 13:03.015
Forget it.

13:03.215 --> 13:04.583
I am not drinking again tonight.

13:04.917 --> 13:06.252
So, just drink beer.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.920
I mean...

13:08.254 --> 13:09.822
Alice is still at her
grandparents', right?

13:10.256 --> 13:12.625
Listen, sweetie,
why don't you go out by yourself tonight?

13:12.892 --> 13:14.760
Oh, come on, Maribelle.
Have some fun.

13:14.960 --> 13:15.861
Don't do that.

13:16.128 --> 13:17.062
Do what, Maribelle?

13:17.396 --> 13:19.231
Knock it off.
I'm serious.

13:19.431 --> 13:20.499
You used to be so fun.

13:20.499 --> 13:23.002
But ever since you got
the condo and the SUV

13:23.002 --> 13:25.337
it's like you're all
401K or whatever.

13:25.604 --> 13:27.673
I'm exactly the same person I've always been.

13:27.673 --> 13:28.507
Oh, yeah?

13:28.774 --> 13:29.842
I checked your car radio.

13:29.842 --> 13:32.178
It's not stuck on
that classic rock station.

13:32.444 --> 13:33.512
For your information

13:34.013 --> 13:36.949
classic rock is both classic,
and it rocks.

13:38.350 --> 13:39.685
What happened to you?

13:39.952 --> 13:41.520
I'm old.

13:46.025 --> 13:47.993
(doorbell ringing)

13:48.527 --> 13:50.396
Daphne, would you
get that?

13:53.699 --> 13:54.266
Hello.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.769
Sorry I'm late.
I...

13:56.769 --> 13:58.070
What's going on?

13:58.304 --> 13:59.638
Uh-oh.

14:01.407 --> 14:02.908
Steady.

14:03.309 --> 14:05.377
Your father and brother
needed a little help.

14:05.845 --> 14:06.879
The oven's all clean.

14:06.879 --> 14:08.881
I just have a bit
of ironing left.

14:08.881 --> 14:09.882
I won't be a minute.

14:10.382 --> 14:12.651
And don't forget, I've drawn
baths for both of you.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.920
Oh, Daphne, that wasn't
necessary...
Oh, no
 You shouldn't have...

14:16.000 --> 14:22.074
www.seedr.co.il - come visit to stream 
your torrents with subtitles search

14:28.400 --> 14:31.971
Are you proud
of yourselves?

14:33.973 --> 14:35.474
We didn't ask her
to do anything.

14:35.474 --> 14:36.842
She offered.

14:37.142 --> 14:40.145
Then why is no one
looking me in the eye?

14:40.512 --> 14:41.580
I'm sorry, Niles.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.082
You're right.
Maybe we took advantage.

14:43.082 --> 14:43.883
.
MARTIN
: Absolutely

14:44.083 --> 14:45.117
We were way out of line.

14:45.117 --> 14:46.418
It won't happen again.

14:50.756 --> 14:52.191
What are you doing?

14:52.591 --> 14:53.425
What?

14:53.659 --> 14:54.727
You're going to leave
that there?

14:54.727 --> 14:55.728
I'll clean
it later.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.229
Well, that's
the whole problem.

14:57.229 --> 14:58.731
If you would just
clean as you go

14:58.731 --> 14:59.732
things wouldn't
pile up.

15:00.232 --> 15:01.233
You wouldn't need
Daphne's help.

15:01.734 --> 15:02.234
I guess.

15:02.735 --> 15:03.235
No, it's true.

15:03.736 --> 15:04.236
Look at this.

15:04.737 --> 15:05.838
Look how easy, you see?

15:05.838 --> 15:09.909
s.
Small, consistent efforts, that's all it take

15:10.342 --> 15:12.745
Just like managing
one's cuticles.

15:14.079 --> 15:16.081
You know, there's a bowl of potato salad

15:16.081 --> 15:18.050
lying out completely uncovered.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.519
It's getting tangy.

15:21.887 --> 15:24.723
The plastic wrap is right here.

15:24.957 --> 15:25.958
We really should help him.

15:26.425 --> 15:27.459
(under breath):
Are you nuts?

15:27.459 --> 15:29.495
.
He's about to make us dinner

15:32.364 --> 15:33.866
He is not.

15:34.233 --> 15:35.267
20 bucks says he is.

15:35.701 --> 15:37.269
Forget money.
Let's wager something real

15:37.269 --> 15:38.103
All right.

15:38.370 --> 15:39.438
If I get him to make dinner

15:39.939 --> 15:40.940
you do all the chores.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.274
If I don't, I'll do them.

15:42.541 --> 15:44.076
I'm ready, Niles.

15:44.476 --> 15:47.046
Excellent.
Because tonight I am taking you

15:47.046 --> 15:49.481
to the finest bistro in
the Pacific Northwest.

15:49.915 --> 15:50.316
You're on.

15:50.749 --> 15:51.317
Take your sweet time,

15:51.817 --> 15:52.751
why don't you?
Hey, guys!

15:52.751 --> 15:53.786
Are you sure you don't
want to stick around?

15:53.786 --> 15:56.288
I was just gonna open
a can of spaghetti.

15:58.557 --> 16:01.360
But you have
sea bass in the fridge.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.195
Oh, it'll probably last
another day.

16:03.595 --> 16:05.030
Oh, I think you should
cook it tonight.

16:05.297 --> 16:06.365
Fine.

16:06.365 --> 16:08.867
I'll nuke it with some ketchup

16:12.938 --> 16:14.006
That's ridiculous.

16:14.506 --> 16:17.509
You can't use your
turkey recipe on fish.

16:17.910 --> 16:19.745
What am I supposed to do?

16:19.945 --> 16:22.014
Well, just take
one clove of garlic,

16:22.014 --> 16:24.016
two tablespoons of finely minced

16:24.450 --> 16:26.352
fresh ginger...

16:26.618 --> 16:30.189
Oh, for heaven's sake,
I'll do it myself.

16:30.622 --> 16:32.691
I suppose I'll lay the table

16:32.691 --> 16:34.193
No, no, Daphne.

16:34.693 --> 16:36.195
.
You've done enough for today

16:36.195 --> 16:37.629
That's Frasier's job.

16:46.238 --> 16:48.741
FRASIER:
And so for our final hour today

16:48.741 --> 16:51.076
I'd like to focus my attention on
first-time callers only.

16:51.377 --> 16:52.244
Hey.

16:52.478 --> 16:53.545
We've been hearing from a lot
Hey!

16:54.046 --> 16:56.048
of familiar voices this week,
and I'd like to shake it up.

16:56.048 --> 16:58.050
I looked for you at
that warehouse party last night,

16:58.050 --> 16:59.385
but I didn't see you.
Oh!

16:59.651 --> 17:01.653
I was in the old meat locker.

17:02.021 --> 17:05.924
Oh, I didn't look in there

17:06.157 --> 17:07.593
Sorry we didn't hook up.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.528
Did I leave my sunglasses in here?

17:09.528 --> 17:10.963
Oh, yes, you did.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.532
So, I'm taking off.

17:14.532 --> 17:16.035
I had a really cool time with you.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.037
I hope you make your break from here soon.

17:18.537 --> 17:19.338
Good news.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.106
I just got off the phone
with my travel agent.

17:21.106 --> 17:22.574
She got me this great fare
to Ho Chi Minh City

17:23.108 --> 17:25.411
and she said it would be no problem to get you
on the same flight.

17:25.676 --> 17:26.678
This is going to be awesome.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.614
I've never seen Asia before.

17:28.614 --> 17:30.115
I've see the band,
of course...

17:30.115 --> 17:31.617
but not... you know.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.119
Oh, well, about that, Kenny-- um...

17:34.119 --> 17:36.088
I already booked a flight.

17:36.488 --> 17:38.057
Oh, well, maybe I can get
on your flight.

17:38.490 --> 17:41.994
Well, see, the thing is
is I, um... I travel solo.

17:42.361 --> 17:43.929
Oh.
It's kind of

17:44.329 --> 17:45.397
a rule I have. I...

17:47.433 --> 17:48.500
Oh, no, plea

17:48.500 --> 17:51.003
I totally get where you're
coming from.

17:51.503 --> 17:52.905
Solo's the way to go.

17:53.205 --> 17:54.273
My high school French club

17:54.273 --> 17:55.774
went to Montreal one time.

17:55.774 --> 17:57.276
Nightmare.

17:57.276 --> 17:58.777
Well, you should still go.

17:59.211 --> 18:00.779
You deserve to have some fun.

18:01.213 --> 18:02.781
Okay.

18:03.282 --> 18:04.283
Yeah.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.121
Well, uh, maybe I'll
run into you over there.

18:09.455 --> 18:10.422
I'd like that.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.270
FRASIER:
Our next caller is Stu
from Madrona.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.773
Go ahead, Stu, I'm listening
.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.608
STU:
All right, it's like this.
..

18:29.875 --> 18:31.944
I've been dating my girlfriend for six years,

18:31.944 --> 18:33.946
and she keeps bugging me
about moving in.

18:34.446 --> 18:37.249
But I know as soon as she does,
my freedom is gone.

18:37.816 --> 18:39.084
Everything's got to be
in the hamper.

18:39.318 --> 18:40.385
I can't eat over the sink.

18:40.385 --> 18:43.155
Can't just go out whenever my buddies call.

18:43.155 --> 18:44.156
That's a lot to give up.

18:44.156 --> 18:46.158
Okay, Stu, how old are you?

18:46.158 --> 18:50.496
The calendar says 47,
but I feel 18, right?

18:50.762 --> 18:53.165
Forty-seven?!

18:53.432 --> 18:53.999
Now, Roz...

18:54.500 --> 18:55.934
I have a suggestion for you, Stu.

18:56.335 --> 18:56.902
Grow the hell up!

18:57.402 --> 18:58.203
What?

18:59.505 --> 19:00.873
I-I-I'm sorry?
I mean

19:01.173 --> 19:03.742
I'm 38, and I feel 38.

19:03.742 --> 19:05.744
Now I know we're all supposed to act

19:05.744 --> 19:07.746
like perpetual teenagers these days.

19:07.746 --> 19:09.748
But you know what?
I like acting my age.

19:10.249 --> 19:11.250
I like being a mom.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.185
I like having a career.

19:13.585 --> 19:15.120
And I like balancing
my checkbook.

19:15.521 --> 19:18.090
When did it become such a bad thing
to be an adult?

19:18.090 --> 19:19.791
Dr. Crane, hello?

19:19.791 --> 19:22.327
Look, don't get me wrong.

19:22.761 --> 19:25.330
I had a great time
when I was younger. I did.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.833
But after a while,
that way of life

19:27.833 --> 19:31.803
just seems... empty.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.274
And you have to go deeper

19:35.641 --> 19:40.646
and commit to things
that really matter to you.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.582
Believe me, when you do that

19:43.582 --> 19:48.487
you'll find out how amazing and rich life can be.

19:48.820 --> 19:50.389
Hey, I know that voice.

19:50.889 --> 19:53.258
You were at Zoo the other night.

19:57.629 --> 20:00.132
You told me you were 29.

20:03.068 --> 20:04.069
Thanks for your call, Stu.

20:04.570 --> 20:06.071
Let's go to traffic.

20:11.243 --> 20:13.178
.
I'm sorry, Frasier

20:13.645 --> 20:15.714
I guess I shouldn't have
unloaded on that guy.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.083
I've just been thinking
a lot about age lately.

20:18.383 --> 20:19.451
That's all right, Roz.

20:19.451 --> 20:21.954
I thought your speech
was courageous.

20:21.954 --> 20:24.456
And who knows?
Even if it went right past Stu,

20:24.957 --> 20:25.924
maybe it reached somebody else

20:25.924 --> 20:29.361
out there on the Frasier Crane
Radio Network.

20:34.199 --> 20:36.268
REPORTER:

all the way to Northgate.

20:36.268 --> 20:37.769
1-5 is stop and go, as usual.

20:37.769 --> 20:39.271
This time because
of a jackknifed...
