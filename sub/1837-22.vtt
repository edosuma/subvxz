WEBVTT

00:12.000 --> 00:14.100
Hey.

00:17.867 --> 00:21.100
Alana and her crew are really
getting on my last nerve.

00:21.100 --> 00:22.233
It's a big test, okay?

00:22.233 --> 00:23.967
Just try to let it
roll off your back.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.367
Or you know,
bounce off your head.

00:29.367 --> 00:33.133
You're right.
I've just got to stay calm.

00:36.967 --> 00:39.233
That's it.

00:39.233 --> 00:41.600
I just can't
take it anymore.

00:41.600 --> 00:45.233
This is me...
and this is the edge.

00:47.133 --> 00:50.900
I am over the edge!
I can't take it anymore!

00:50.900 --> 00:53.200
You guys have been on my case
since the fourth grade. Why?

00:53.200 --> 00:55.467

Hey, hey.
Chelsea! Check it out.

02:03.133 --> 02:04.900
I just got
my driver's permit.

02:04.900 --> 02:07.867
That one little piece
of paper means freedom.

02:07.867 --> 02:10.200
Well, come on!
Let's hit the road.

02:10.200 --> 02:12.200
We can do that, Chels,
as long as I'm in

02:12.200 --> 02:14.700

with a licensed driver over 25,

02:14.700 --> 02:16.900
within city limits,
before sundown."

02:16.900 --> 02:19.600
Sounds like you had
more freedom like on the bus.

02:22.834 --> 02:24.400
Oh, hey, Rae.
Did you get in a lot of trouble?

02:24.400 --> 02:25.500
Yeah.

02:25.500 --> 02:27.200
I flunked the test.

02:27.200 --> 02:29.200
And the principal said
if I don't make peace

02:29.200 --> 02:30.734
with Alana, then
we're both suspended.

02:30.734 --> 02:33.400
Rae, you really need to settle
this beef once and for all.

02:33.400 --> 02:34.667
I know.

02:34.667 --> 02:35.700
That's why I made
an appointment with her

02:35.700 --> 02:37.100
in her office.

02:37.100 --> 02:38.734
Yeah, that's really good.
You know what I'm saying?

02:38.734 --> 02:40.367
Because...

02:40.367 --> 02:42.200
Hold on.
That girl got an office?

02:50.033 --> 02:51.500
All right, Baxter.
Make it fast.

02:51.500 --> 02:52.767
Roca, get her a seat.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.800
I meant get her a chair!

03:02.800 --> 03:05.100
No, no.
That's okay.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.500
I like the seat down.

03:13.467 --> 03:15.734
So why have you
come to me today?

03:15.734 --> 03:20.500
Listen. I think it's just really
time we settle our differences.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.300
(<i>scoffs </i>)

03:22.300 --> 03:23.467
By (<i>scoffs </i>)...

03:23.467 --> 03:25.100
Alana's scoffing
at your suggestion.

03:25.100 --> 03:27.700
I know you don't want
to get suspended

03:27.700 --> 03:31.033
and lose all of this.

03:31.033 --> 03:33.200
Okay, keep talking.

03:33.200 --> 03:37.000
Look, why don't we just,
why don't we call it a truce?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.400
Girl, make peace.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.834
Maybe if we stop fighting
for two seconds,

03:39.834 --> 03:42.600
we could get to know
each other and become friends.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.400
(<i>laughing </i>)

03:44.400 --> 03:46.100
I know, see.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.300
Isn't that funny?

03:47.300 --> 03:48.834
We're laughing together.

03:52.100 --> 03:54.033
Why don't we try to do
something fun together?

03:54.033 --> 03:56.133
We already did, this morning.

03:56.133 --> 03:57.400
When we chucked
the papers at you.

03:57.400 --> 04:00.400
But no, you didn't like it.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.000
Well, maybe we
could do something

04:02.000 --> 04:03.367
that's fun for
the both of us.

04:03.367 --> 04:05.300
Whatever.

04:05.300 --> 04:06.734
As long as it's after dark,

04:06.734 --> 04:08.867
and we're not seen
in public together.

04:08.867 --> 04:14.100
Got it! What about an old-
fashioned slumber party?

04:14.100 --> 04:16.400
(<i>laughing </i>)

04:17.600 --> 04:24.133
You mean, you're inviting me
to a slumber party?

04:25.300 --> 04:28.934
For some reason, Alana
is considering it.

04:28.934 --> 04:32.367
So you mean we'll
all be in pajamas,

04:32.367 --> 04:33.367
doing each other's nails?

04:33.367 --> 04:35.400
Yep.
I'll even make s'mores.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.500
S'mores?

04:36.500 --> 04:37.500
Yes!

04:38.600 --> 04:42.600
I mean, (<i>scoffs </i>) s'mores.

04:44.100 --> 04:47.000
(<i>speaking Spanish </i>)

04:48.800 --> 04:51.233
Alana said something,
something, something,

04:51.233 --> 04:52.667
in terra sante.

04:52.667 --> 04:55.233
Cool, we'll make it my
house, Saturday night.

04:55.233 --> 04:57.100
Fine.

04:57.100 --> 05:00.734
I'll go to your
little slumber party,

05:00.734 --> 05:05.700
but only under one condition.
It better be fun.

05:07.667 --> 05:11.200
Oh, and no weird stuff.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.967
Because every time
I'm around you, Baxter,

05:12.967 --> 05:14.000
something weird happens.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.967
That's actually
two conditions.

05:20.867 --> 05:22.867
Hey, Mr. B.

05:22.867 --> 05:25.033
I want to thank you
for giving me my first

05:25.033 --> 05:27.200
driving lesson.
My mom's been so busy.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.600
Oh, oh. And if we pass by
any of the homeys,

05:29.600 --> 05:30.800
you mind ducking down?

05:30.800 --> 05:32.300
Hold up there, Hotrod.

05:32.300 --> 05:36.233
First lesson is parking.
Park it right there.

05:36.233 --> 05:38.100
Now I said I was
going to teach you

05:38.100 --> 05:39.600
how to drive.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.200
I didn't say I was going
to let you get behind

05:41.200 --> 05:42.300
the wheel of my car.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.767
Now,
buckle your seat belt.

05:44.767 --> 05:46.667
Zig-a-jig-zig.

05:48.500 --> 05:51.500
Zig-a-jig-zig.

05:51.500 --> 05:54.467
Eddie, driving
is a serious business.

05:54.467 --> 05:55.734
Now, come on.

05:55.734 --> 05:57.000
Give it some
pretend gas

05:57.000 --> 05:59.200
and pull away carefully
from the imaginary curb.

06:03.300 --> 06:04.600
Okay, all clear.
Let's roll.

06:04.600 --> 06:05.367
Eddie! Watch out!

06:05.367 --> 06:08.000
(<i>screams </i>)

06:08.000 --> 06:10.867
You almost hit a moose.

06:10.867 --> 06:13.233
Cory, what are you doing?

06:13.233 --> 06:16.500
Earning five bucks.

06:16.500 --> 06:17.700
He's helping me test you.

06:17.700 --> 06:19.000
You never know what
kind of obstacles

06:19.000 --> 06:20.500
you're going to run
into out on the road.

06:20.500 --> 06:21.567
Yeah, Mr. B.

06:21.567 --> 06:22.867
The road is filled
with little kids

06:22.867 --> 06:24.400
running around in moose hats.

06:24.400 --> 06:27.100
Well, not if you
keep hitting them.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.000
Careful, Rae!

06:33.000 --> 06:34.133
Moose crossing.

06:36.900 --> 06:39.400
Dad, you know that
I have a slumber
party tonight.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.300
I thought you were
taking Eddie out driving.

06:41.300 --> 06:42.600
So did I.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.734
Come on, Dad, you've
got to go. Please.

06:44.734 --> 06:46.300
Ooh, can I come, too?

06:46.300 --> 06:48.800
You need to take
Bullwinkle with you.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.367
Okay, fine.

06:50.367 --> 06:52.000
Eddie, time to get
behind the wheel.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.400
Yes!

06:56.200 --> 06:57.900
Eddie, two hands.

06:57.900 --> 07:00.200
Yeah, Mr. B.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.600
I would really hate
to lose control

07:01.600 --> 07:05.367
of Baby's First
Steering Wheel.

07:06.567 --> 07:09.667
(<i>"This Old Man" playing </i>)

07:10.834 --> 07:13.934
If you honk the horn,
bubbles come out.

07:13.934 --> 07:17.200
What comes out
if I honk you?

07:17.200 --> 07:19.467
Okay, okay.
Enough, you two.

07:19.467 --> 07:21.233
Eddie, keep your
eyes on the road.

07:23.567 --> 07:26.400
(<i>honks horn </i>)

07:30.700 --> 07:33.900
(<i>door bell rings </i>)

07:33.900 --> 07:37.300
They're here.

07:37.300 --> 07:39.734
Chels, why you got
to say it like that?

07:39.734 --> 07:41.934
I don't know, maybe
because you're inviting

07:41.934 --> 07:43.400
evil into your house.

07:43.400 --> 07:45.800
Listen, I need this.
Okay, Chels?

07:45.800 --> 07:46.934
You've got to help me.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.000
Remember, nothing weird.

07:51.133 --> 07:52.467
Hey, ya'll.
Come on in.

08:01.100 --> 08:04.867
Oh, I love your pajamas!

08:04.867 --> 08:05.900
You're really getting

08:05.900 --> 08:08.700
into the spirit
of slumbering!

08:08.700 --> 08:11.200
Alana feels you're
trying too hard.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.200
Right, come on in.
Let's get to the fun.

08:17.300 --> 08:19.600
Okay. So what
can we trash?

08:19.600 --> 08:21.300
No, no.
The other kind of fun.

08:21.300 --> 08:22.500
You know, the one
where property

08:22.500 --> 08:23.600
isn't destroyed.

08:24.767 --> 08:26.734
Hey, let's just get
to the beauty treatments.

08:26.734 --> 08:29.300
What you saying,
we're not beautiful?

08:29.300 --> 08:30.467
No, no.
You're gorgeous.

08:30.467 --> 08:32.000
This is just to enhance.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.800
You know, it's
stuff that we do

08:33.800 --> 08:35.000
at slumber parties.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.500
Right.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.567
I knew that.

08:38.567 --> 08:40.700
Let's do some beauty.

08:40.700 --> 08:42.867
Okay.

08:47.500 --> 08:50.400
Do you love it?

08:50.400 --> 08:54.500
Oh, so much.
I love it.

08:55.934 --> 08:58.734
Oh, remember in fifth grade
when I put the lizard down

08:58.734 --> 09:00.200
the back of your pants?

09:00.200 --> 09:02.100
Hilarious.

09:02.100 --> 09:03.500
Yeah, yeah.

09:03.500 --> 09:07.100
Who knew those cute little
things had such sharp claws.

09:07.100 --> 09:11.000
I don't know why it was
so much fun to torture you.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.934
Well, maybe because deep
down you really liked me.

09:15.934 --> 09:18.667
No, that wasn't it.

09:18.667 --> 09:20.934
I pretty much torture everybody.

09:20.934 --> 09:24.600
Admit it, Alana.
You gave me special torture.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.800
Yeah, I guess I did.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.934
All right.
All done.

09:30.934 --> 09:32.834
What do you think?

09:32.834 --> 09:33.834
Wow, cool.

09:33.834 --> 09:35.767
Is this not the best
slumber party

09:35.767 --> 09:38.300
you've ever been to?

09:40.700 --> 09:44.834
Well, between
you and me, Raven,

09:44.834 --> 09:46.400
it's the only
slumber party

09:46.400 --> 09:47.600
I've ever been to.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.967
Oh. Well, you know,
that's probably

09:50.967 --> 09:53.500
because you're too cool
for that, so, understandable.

09:53.500 --> 09:58.000
No.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.233
It's just that
no one ever invited me.

10:00.233 --> 10:03.033
That's terrible.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.300
You might find this
hard to believe,

10:06.300 --> 10:08.900
but some girls
find me intimidating.

10:09.834 --> 10:12.033
Blow.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.100
Okay, you guys!
It's ready!

10:18.133 --> 10:19.233
I hate to brag,
but this batch

10:19.233 --> 10:20.300
is like perfect.

Yes! I am starving!

Yes! Give me this!

10:26.900 --> 10:28.200
Um, Alana wants you
to know that you're

10:28.200 --> 10:29.367
eating her facial mask.

10:30.600 --> 10:33.600
(<i>laughing </i>)

10:33.600 --> 10:34.934
I've got to say this is

10:34.934 --> 10:36.967
way more fun than
I thought it would be.

10:36.967 --> 10:39.033
Yeah, Rae,
eat some more.

10:40.667 --> 10:43.300
All right, girls,

11:19.033 --> 11:21.400
(<i>R&amp;B playing </i>)

11:21.400 --> 11:23.133
Chelsea, kitchen, now.

11:23.133 --> 11:25.967
All right, you guys,
keep partying!

11:25.967 --> 11:27.567
Party, party,
party, party!

11:29.834 --> 11:31.000
That's right.

11:32.367 --> 11:33.300
Chelsea!

11:33.300 --> 11:34.700
Yeah, sorry.

11:34.700 --> 11:36.500
It's just that my groove thing
has a mind of its own.

11:38.767 --> 11:40.600
Chelsea, listen,
this is important, okay?

11:40.600 --> 11:42.700
I had a vision that there's
going to be an earthquake.

11:42.700 --> 11:43.567
An earthqua...?!

11:43.567 --> 11:44.934
Shh!

11:44.934 --> 11:47.800
Earthquake?
When's it going to happen?

11:47.800 --> 11:48.700
Sometime tonight.

11:48.700 --> 11:49.867
What are we going to do?

11:49.867 --> 11:51.500
I don't know, Chels.

11:51.500 --> 11:53.033
I mean, if I tell them
about my vision,

11:53.033 --> 11:55.000
then they'll
know I'm psychic,
and that's not good.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.834
And if I don't tell them,
that could be dangerous.

11:56.834 --> 11:58.567
And that's not good.
I mean,

11:58.567 --> 12:01.300
if I send them home
and don't tell them why,

12:01.300 --> 12:04.000
they'll think I'm weird,
and that's not good.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.500
This is not good. No.

12:06.500 --> 12:07.600
Okay, but we can do this.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.700
We just got to keep
the party fun

12:08.700 --> 12:10.133
and we got
to keep it safe.

12:10.133 --> 12:11.300
Right. No problem.
We can do that.

12:11.300 --> 12:14.967
Yeah, we just,
we just can't be weird.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.400
So explain how this
is not weird.

12:19.400 --> 12:20.767
Hey, you know what?

12:20.767 --> 12:24.200
Everyone plays this
at all the cool slumber parties.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.900
It's called
the Protective Headgear Game.

12:26.900 --> 12:28.600
This is stupid.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.000
Chill. If they're
playing it

12:30.000 --> 12:31.734
at all the cool
slumber parties,

12:31.734 --> 12:34.200
then we should be
playing it, too.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.033
Explain the
rules, Raven.

12:36.033 --> 12:39.033
Actually, the rules
are the best part.

12:39.033 --> 12:41.367
If you feel shaking
of any kind,

12:41.367 --> 12:43.367
you run under the piano
and take cover.

12:43.367 --> 12:45.233
Whoo-hoo! Fun!

12:45.233 --> 12:46.734
Fun!

12:46.734 --> 12:48.767
That is the spirit, Chels.

12:48.767 --> 12:51.300
Okay, let's practice.

12:51.300 --> 12:53.934
Oh, no, it's shaking!
It's shaking!

12:53.934 --> 12:56.200
Under the piano!

12:56.200 --> 12:58.834
Go, go, go,
under the piano, go!

12:58.834 --> 12:59.934
Get over there!

12:59.934 --> 13:02.467
Oh, wow.

13:02.467 --> 13:03.967
That's very impressive.
Oh, my goodness.

13:03.967 --> 13:05.100
I'm surprised

13:05.100 --> 13:06.400
you guys never played
this game before.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.500
I haven't!
I haven't really!

13:08.500 --> 13:12.600
Right. So here
is the twist, okay?

13:12.600 --> 13:14.467
Now, you have to stay
underneath the piano

13:14.467 --> 13:17.600
until the head helmet--
that's me--

13:17.600 --> 13:19.300
says, "Come out. Come out.
It's safe," okay?

13:19.300 --> 13:20.600
I'm going to go
make a phone call.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.900
Hey, Baxter,

13:22.900 --> 13:24.233
I'm getting hungry.

13:24.233 --> 13:26.967
And you won't like me
when I'm hungry.

13:26.967 --> 13:28.467
All right.

13:28.467 --> 13:31.200
Well, what if I make s'mores?

13:31.200 --> 13:32.400
S'mores!

13:35.867 --> 13:38.400
(<i>phone ringing </i>)
Dad, your cell phone's ringing.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.400
That's right.

13:39.400 --> 13:40.834
But I'm not going
to answer it.

13:40.834 --> 13:41.967
When you're driving,

13:41.967 --> 13:44.133
you got to keep your mind
on the road

13:44.133 --> 13:45.934
and both hands on the wheel.

13:45.934 --> 13:49.834
(<i>musical tones playing </i>)

13:49.834 --> 13:52.000
Oh, that's my cell.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.600
Edward, what did
I just say

13:53.600 --> 13:56.100
about driving
and talking
on the phone?

13:56.100 --> 13:58.700
I'm not driving!

14:00.567 --> 14:02.300
I'll get it.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.867
Here.

14:05.867 --> 14:10.133
Hello. L.A. Tease Line.
Corey speaking, baby.

14:11.867 --> 14:16.033
Oh, hey, Raven.

14:16.033 --> 14:17.700
What?

14:18.600 --> 14:20.734
Okay, I'll tell him.
I'll tell him.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.200
What's wrong?

14:22.200 --> 14:23.400
Raven had a vision.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.300
She said there's going
to be an earthquake.

14:25.300 --> 14:26.567
An earthquake?

14:26.567 --> 14:28.033
We got to get home.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.467
Eddie, I'm about to set
a bad example,

14:30.467 --> 14:31.967
but this is an emergency.

14:31.967 --> 14:33.734
(<i>engine revving </i>)

14:33.734 --> 14:36.200
Rae, are those s'mores
ready yet?

14:36.200 --> 14:37.467
'Cause the girls
are kinda getting angry

14:37.467 --> 14:39.734
that they're still stuck
under the piano.

14:39.734 --> 14:42.033
Yeah, they don't get
this game at all.

14:42.033 --> 14:43.200
Chels, listen.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.400
I just need a few more seconds,
okay?

14:44.400 --> 14:45.500
Just distract 'em.

14:45.500 --> 14:46.700
Right, right.

14:46.700 --> 14:49.600
I'll distract them
with, with, with... Ooh.

14:52.800 --> 14:53.967
Perfect.

14:53.967 --> 14:56.800
I'm not even going
to ask, dude.

14:59.233 --> 15:01.567
And I want you to put

15:01.567 --> 15:04.100
that helmet on,
missy, okay?

15:04.100 --> 15:05.233
Safety first.

15:05.233 --> 15:08.000
You happy?

15:08.000 --> 15:09.700
You see, officer,
we were at home

15:09.700 --> 15:10.767
driving on the couch,

15:10.767 --> 15:12.467
and then the girls
came downstairs

15:12.467 --> 15:14.467
in their pajamas
and they kicked us out,

15:14.467 --> 15:17.900
so I had Eddie here
drive with his toy
steering wheel.

15:17.900 --> 15:20.867
So he was the one
that was speeding?

15:20.867 --> 15:22.100
No, that was me.

15:22.100 --> 15:24.100
But only because
my daughter called to warn us

15:24.100 --> 15:26.100
that there was
an earthquake coming.

15:26.100 --> 15:29.200
You see, she's psychic.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.367
Really?

15:30.367 --> 15:34.000
When I'm not working,
I'm a leprechaun.

15:35.934 --> 15:38.567
I got to say I whipped
these up pretty good.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.233
What are you doing
on the floor, Baxter?

15:43.233 --> 15:44.367
Trying to get up.

15:44.367 --> 15:46.734
Make it fast
or we're out of here.

15:46.734 --> 15:48.734
We're starving.

15:48.734 --> 15:49.967
And that egg beater stuff?

15:49.967 --> 15:52.400
It's getting weird.

15:55.600 --> 15:56.734
(<i>grunting </i>)

15:56.734 --> 15:58.867
Oh, no, it's stuck!

15:58.867 --> 16:00.066
I can't see!

16:00.066 --> 16:01.900
Move it!

16:05.200 --> 16:06.500
Oh, okay, okay.

16:06.500 --> 16:07.467
I can't freak out, okay.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.467
Just make the s'mores.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.500
It'll be okay. All right.

16:09.500 --> 16:12.300
Oh, man.

16:17.500 --> 16:18.567
Got to make the s'mores.

16:18.567 --> 16:19.734
Got to find the graham crackers.

16:19.734 --> 16:21.100
Graham crackers, got 'em.

16:21.100 --> 16:24.300
Graham crackers--
one, two, three, four.

16:24.300 --> 16:26.100
Now I got to find
the marshmallows.

16:26.100 --> 16:27.300
The refrigerator.

16:28.467 --> 16:30.200
Got it.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.033
Here's the refrigerator.
Here we go.

16:32.033 --> 16:34.400
Okay, marshmallow fluff.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.967
Okay, got it.

16:35.967 --> 16:38.967
All right. Let's go get it.

16:38.967 --> 16:40.300
All right. Here we go.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.400
Okay, spoon.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.200
Where's the spoon?

16:45.834 --> 16:47.200
All right.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.500
Got to love the fluff.
All right.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.900
Now I find the chocolate syrup.

16:51.900 --> 16:52.967
Chocolate syrup.

16:52.967 --> 16:56.133
Oh... chocolate syrup!

16:56.133 --> 16:57.200
Okay, here we go.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.500
Oh, yeah.

16:58.500 --> 17:01.867
I am going to smother it
in chocolatey goodness!

17:01.867 --> 17:04.567
You are having fun.

17:04.567 --> 17:07.100
This is not weird.

17:07.100 --> 17:10.300
You are being distracted.

17:10.300 --> 17:12.300
Okay,<i>ya no mas.</i>

17:12.300 --> 17:13.834
We are out of here.

17:16.900 --> 17:18.500
Okay, who's ready for s'mores?

17:18.500 --> 17:19.667
Who's ready?

17:19.667 --> 17:21.600
These are s'mores?

17:27.233 --> 17:30.000
Yeah. I built 'em up too much.

17:31.367 --> 17:34.900
Baxter, did you make those
with your eyes closed?

17:34.900 --> 17:36.734
Sorta.

17:36.734 --> 17:39.000
I kinda had
a little helmet accident.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Chels, a little help.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.667
Yeah, sure, sure.

17:41.667 --> 17:43.800
Okay, come on, pull.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.700
A little help, girls,
actually.

17:45.700 --> 17:47.600
We could use some help.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.500
Okay, all right, all right.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.467
Now, on ten. One,

17:52.467 --> 17:54.367
two, ten!

17:54.367 --> 17:56.033
(<i>girls shriek </i>)

17:57.600 --> 18:03.200
Baxter, get off of me!

18:03.200 --> 18:05.500
This is my first
and last slumber party!

18:05.500 --> 18:07.600
No. Okay, wait,
you can't go.

18:07.600 --> 18:11.100
I finally get to go
to a slumber party

18:11.100 --> 18:14.567
and it had to be yours.

18:14.567 --> 18:16.700
Oh, Alana, you got
to let me explain.

18:16.700 --> 18:18.400
<i>No quiero oir mas.</i>

18:18.400 --> 18:22.100
The only thing weirder
than you at school

18:22.100 --> 18:23.867
is you in your own house.

18:25.767 --> 18:28.700
There's going to be
an earthquake.

18:30.934 --> 18:33.700
Baxter, nobody knows
when there's going

18:33.700 --> 18:35.133
to be an earthquake.

18:35.133 --> 18:36.233
I do.

18:36.233 --> 18:37.467
Raven, what
are you doing?

18:37.467 --> 18:38.400
I have to, Chels.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.934
This is going
to be dangerous.

18:40.934 --> 18:44.800
Look, the reason
that I know

18:44.800 --> 18:47.400
there's going to be an
earthquake is because...

18:48.734 --> 18:53.567
is because...

18:53.567 --> 18:55.300
I'm psychic.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.834
(<i>crashing </i>)

19:04.233 --> 19:05.667
Earthquake!

19:05.667 --> 19:07.033
(<i>screaming </i>)

19:07.033 --> 19:08.467
Everybody under the piano!
Go, go, go!

19:08.467 --> 19:10.500
(<i>car sirens wailing </i>)

19:13.767 --> 19:17.767
Wow, Raven,
you really are psychic.

19:17.767 --> 19:19.800
Yo, yo, yo,
is everybody okay?

19:19.800 --> 19:21.400
Did you feel the earthquake?

19:21.400 --> 19:22.667
That was no earthquake.

19:22.667 --> 19:25.400
That my dad's car
crashing into
the garage wall.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.400
Come on, Corey.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.500
Give me a hand, man.

19:29.100 --> 19:32.700
I hope I didn't scare
you guys too much.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.300
Rae, I rushed back

19:34.300 --> 19:35.900
as soon as I got your call.

19:36.967 --> 19:38.367
Whoa, Baxter,

19:38.367 --> 19:40.500
you had your pops
run into the side

19:40.500 --> 19:42.900
of the house to make us
think there was an earthquake?

19:42.900 --> 19:44.900
Uh...

19:44.900 --> 19:46.200
yup.

19:48.400 --> 19:51.033
That was so...

19:52.500 --> 19:54.500
cool.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.567
You really got us.

19:56.567 --> 19:57.767
The helmets,

19:57.767 --> 19:59.500
making us hide
under the piano.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.667
Making us think
you were psychic.

20:01.667 --> 20:05.133
Yeah, me, psychic? Please?

20:05.133 --> 20:08.834
Alana is impressed
by the depth of
your deception.

20:08.834 --> 20:11.400
That was the coolest
prank ever!

20:12.700 --> 20:14.100
So everybody's fine?

20:14.100 --> 20:17.100
Yes, thanks, Dad, so much
for helping me out

20:17.100 --> 20:18.300
with the prank.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.800
You made me it feel
like a real earthquake,

20:19.800 --> 20:20.967
just like I envisioned it.

20:20.967 --> 20:22.000
Remember what I said?

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
Oh, right. Anytime.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.200
Uh, Eddie,

20:27.200 --> 20:28.600
you ready
for another lesson?

20:28.600 --> 20:30.000
You going to
let me drive now?

20:30.000 --> 20:31.467
No, I'm going
to let you dial.

20:31.467 --> 20:32.734
I'm going
to show you how

20:32.734 --> 20:34.367
to call the
insurance company.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.233
Wow...

20:38.233 --> 20:40.100
I can't believe
you pulled that off.

20:40.100 --> 20:41.600
Yeah, me neither.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.967
So are y'all going to stay?

20:44.967 --> 20:47.000
Hey, we came to have fun.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.600
All right!
Let's get this party re-started.

Alana, great news.

21:02.734 --> 21:05.600
I got our makeup
tests back from
Mr. Freno.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.600
We passed!

21:07.600 --> 21:09.033
Yes!

21:09.033 --> 21:12.100
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

21:12.100 --> 21:13.500
I'm so excited
for us!

Man, why'd the hugging stop?

21:20.600 --> 21:23.467
Alana's been doing
some thinking.

21:23.467 --> 21:25.000
Okay.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.400
You really got me
with that slumber party prank.

21:27.400 --> 21:28.467
Didn't I, girl?

21:28.467 --> 21:30.867
I thought I did
with the earthquake.

21:30.867 --> 21:32.600
That was funny, wasn't it?

21:32.600 --> 21:36.934
But see, now I've got
to get you back.

21:36.934 --> 21:40.600
Why? You keeping score
or something?

21:45.400 --> 21:47.934
I think we can
squeeze her in right now.
