01:45.689 --> 01:50.778
He is a classless, graceless,
shameless barbarian.

01:50.861 --> 01:53.571
What he did to you, Elizabeth,
it was disgusting.

01:53.656 --> 01:55.240
- Awful.
- Just vile.

01:55.323 --> 01:57.450
- Can you pass the plate of...
- Yeah.

01:57.534 --> 01:58.827
But why didn't you tell us?

01:58.911 --> 02:01.789
The thought of you fighting this alone,
all those years...

02:01.872 --> 02:04.207
I didn't want pity.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.651
Is it true that they were arguing?

02:05.709 --> 02:08.961
No, she came down here to be with me.

02:09.045 --> 02:12.382
Of course, we didn't expect that
it was gonna be made a public display.

02:12.465 --> 02:16.845
I guess he thought that was
the best way to dispel the rumors.

02:16.929 --> 02:19.056
That man does not deserve to be president.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.100
I've never wanted
to speak ill of him, Elizabeth,

02:22.184 --> 02:24.937
but when I think of the way
he's treated you and Claire...

02:25.020 --> 02:27.439
Oh, stop now.
He is still her son-in-law.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.524
No, Bar's right.

02:29.607 --> 02:32.152
He doesn't deserve to be president.

02:33.111 --> 02:36.364
You could... all help me, actually.

02:36.448 --> 02:38.075
- Anything.
- Just say the word.

02:39.743 --> 02:41.369
Heather Dunbar.

02:42.537 --> 02:44.331
We should be supporting her.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.375
With our checkbooks.

02:47.459 --> 02:49.544
You really want him to lose?

02:49.627 --> 02:53.631
When he loses,
Claire can begin her own career...

02:54.341 --> 02:57.052
which is far more important to me.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.555
I don't know if we can
really make a difference, but...

03:00.638 --> 03:03.892
I'd rather do more than just
sit around and bad-mouth him.

03:03.976 --> 03:05.936
So, we just write a check?

03:06.519 --> 03:09.022
Now, Francis can't know.

03:09.106 --> 03:13.986
I mean, our donations
will have to be... once removed.

03:19.407 --> 03:21.207
That amendment
has stalled for years.

03:21.243 --> 03:23.036
Because we didn't have someone
in Veterans Affairs.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.288
It isn't a veterans issue.
It's public health.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.539
That's not my specialty.

03:26.623 --> 03:29.417
Wait, you're telling me you don't know
anyone who's had breast cancer?

03:29.501 --> 03:32.170
I mean
in terms of legislation.

03:32.254 --> 03:33.756
Fifty percent more.

03:33.839 --> 03:37.050
That's how many more black women die
of breast cancer than white women.

03:37.134 --> 03:40.137
In our district,
it's higher than the murder rate.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.806
Help us get this clinic.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.142
I don't deny that it's an important issue,

03:45.225 --> 03:47.644
but I have to pick and choose
what I support.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.856
You're in a tight race back home,
Congresswoman.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.108
We'll set up a super PAC.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.027
Three million dollars.

03:56.111 --> 03:58.030
You did this
without talking to me?

03:58.113 --> 03:59.740
Claire and I spoke at length, Mother.

03:59.823 --> 04:00.824
Claire?

04:02.159 --> 04:04.787
You're calling the First Lady
by her given name, now?

04:04.870 --> 04:07.539
Well, and I would hope
you would, too, Congresswoman.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.707
You went behind my back, Mrs. Underwood.

04:09.792 --> 04:11.960
I'm not asking for a full endorsement.

04:13.086 --> 04:17.089
I'm just asking for your blessing
on Celia delaying her run.

04:17.173 --> 04:21.136
And of course,
a promise to not campaign against me.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.721
Jackie Sharp's big on Dunbar.

04:23.806 --> 04:25.098
Why would she help you?

04:25.182 --> 04:27.600
This money isn't directly linked to us.

04:27.684 --> 04:31.897
You mean the president's comfortable
putting money in Jackie's war chest?

04:31.980 --> 04:34.649
He is,
but we have to keep this quiet.

04:34.732 --> 04:38.528
There can't be any communication
between your office and his.

04:43.616 --> 04:46.161
- Speech?
- Seth put in your latest edits.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.038
Once you approve,
we'll send it to the teleprompters.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.999
- Has she arrived yet?
- A few minutes ago.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.461
Please sit down.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.924
If Jackie gets cold feet,
we can't leave her any choice.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.051
I'm already on top of that.

05:02.760 --> 05:03.761
How?

05:03.846 --> 05:07.850
They always use the same hotel.
I've got a guy set up across the street.

05:08.851 --> 05:10.894
I'm assuming you're being careful.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.521
I'm not just a tech outfit.
I can go old school, too.

05:14.564 --> 05:17.609
Ma'am?
We have lunch prepared for you.

05:21.196 --> 05:22.906
This is impressive.

05:24.407 --> 05:27.577
Well, soak it up while you can.
We won't be here long.

05:27.660 --> 05:28.954
I'll be right back.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.973
Anatoly Rostropov.
His empire's worth 30 billion.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.849
Petrov had him killed last night.

06:31.934 --> 06:34.894
Stanislav Ustravich,
founder of Turkas Oil.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.771
Found dead early this morning.

06:36.854 --> 06:39.691
Igor Milkin, media tycoon
worth 24 billion.

06:39.774 --> 06:41.776
Very outspoken against Petrov

06:41.859 --> 06:44.321
after the government seized
his TV stations and newspapers.

06:44.404 --> 06:47.574
His private plane landed in Bangor, Maine,
two hours ago.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.617
We've got him quarantined on the tarmac.

06:49.701 --> 06:52.829
He's seeking political asylum.
Says he's in fear for his life.

06:52.912 --> 06:55.958
We believe they've been
formulating a plan to unseat Petrov.

06:56.833 --> 06:59.711
Brutus, Cassius,
and the one that got away.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.339
Moscow's adamant
we send him back immediately.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.423
Then send him back.

07:03.506 --> 07:06.259
I don't want the State of the Union
overshadowed by some asylum dispute.

07:06.343 --> 07:07.623
He's Petrov's problem, not ours.

07:07.677 --> 07:11.098
Legally, sir, we are obligated
to process his asylum request.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.641
- Don't tell me the press knows he's here.
- No, sir.

07:13.725 --> 07:16.728
We jammed communications on his plane
as soon as it entered U.S. airspace.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.313
Then we don't have a problem, do we?

07:18.396 --> 07:20.276
It's likely he'll be killed
if we send him back.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.817
So be it. He tried to slay a dragon
and he missed the mark.

07:22.900 --> 07:23.901
Now he's gotta face the fire.

07:23.986 --> 07:26.488
Our fear is more killings,
more company seizures.

07:26.571 --> 07:29.491
That leads to a run on the banks,
collapse of the ruble, default on debts.

07:29.574 --> 07:30.617
And we already know

07:30.700 --> 07:33.370
he's been back-channeling
about a bailout with the IMF.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.788
Well, if you have a proposal to make,
then make it quickly.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.291
- I have a speech to prep for.
- Yes, sir.

07:38.375 --> 07:43.213
Last year you wore the taupe,
so maybe this is too similar?

07:48.385 --> 07:49.636
Come in.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.265
I was able to get Mrs. Hale on the phone.

07:53.348 --> 07:56.059
Oh, great. Uh, could you excuse me
for a moment?

08:01.898 --> 08:03.900
- <i>Mother?</i>
- You doing okay, Mrs. Hale?

08:03.984 --> 08:05.277
Yes, thank you.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.113
<i>Who was that?</i>

08:08.196 --> 08:11.283
Oh, um...

08:11.366 --> 08:12.993
I'm treating myself to a pedicure.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.954
Nobody can hear me.

08:17.039 --> 08:18.956
You wanted to talk?

08:19.041 --> 08:22.377
<i>Yes, I wanted to thank you,
for all of your help.</i>

08:22.460 --> 08:25.297
Uh, it looks like the congresswoman
is leaning toward a yes.

08:25.380 --> 08:28.716
<i>You know, I was thinking,
when you run,</i>

08:28.800 --> 08:31.011
<i>you should use
your maiden name instead.</i>

08:31.094 --> 08:33.138
Mother, I couldn't do that.
It would look bad.

08:33.221 --> 08:37.142
Mmm... Well, then how about if you...

08:38.143 --> 08:41.563
if you use Claire Hale-Underwood?

08:41.645 --> 08:43.940
That has a nice ring to it.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.567
Maybe.

08:45.650 --> 08:48.361
<i>- Have you seen him yet?</i>
- No, not yet.

08:50.072 --> 08:51.614
<i>What are you gonna wear tonight?</i>

08:51.698 --> 08:53.783
I was just deciding that now, actually.

08:53.866 --> 08:56.161
<i>Something dark, I hope.</i>

08:56.244 --> 08:58.746
Well, it's between black and ivory,
and to tell you the truth,

08:58.830 --> 09:00.165
<i>this ivory is so beautiful...</i>

09:00.248 --> 09:02.959
Oh, for God's sakes,
don't wear ivory.

09:03.043 --> 09:07.047
<i>Even with your figure,
it'll accentuate all the wrong places.</i>

09:15.263 --> 09:17.140
<i>Are you going to watch the speech?</i>

09:17.224 --> 09:18.225
<i>Mother?</i>

09:18.308 --> 09:20.060
Yes, I'm gonna...

09:20.143 --> 09:23.063
I'm gonna have Michael
put a TV in the bedroom.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.941
Mrs. Underwood,
the president is ready for you.

09:27.024 --> 09:28.068
I'll be right out.

09:29.319 --> 09:30.945
Mother, I have to go.

09:31.028 --> 09:34.407
Yes, I... Of course.
I'm sure you must be very busy.

09:34.491 --> 09:35.783
<i>I'll see you when I get home?</i>

09:36.784 --> 09:38.745
If I'm asleep...

09:38.828 --> 09:40.330
<i>Then I'll see you in the morning.</i>

09:41.289 --> 09:42.874
<i>Goodbye, Mother.</i>

09:42.957 --> 09:45.502
Bye. Wear the black!

09:52.134 --> 09:54.761
I don't want even
the slightest chance this gets out.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.013
We set up a perimeter.
And we'll cover the tail number.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.599
Good. Set up a call with Petrov,
for after the speech.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.143
It'll be 5:00 a.m. in Moscow.

10:01.226 --> 10:02.769
Oh, I guarantee he'll be watching.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.855
Sir?
I think you should take this.

10:05.938 --> 10:06.981
Excuse me.

10:10.152 --> 10:11.653
Hello, Congresswoman.

10:24.249 --> 10:26.959
Sorry for the delay.
Please sit down.

10:28.336 --> 10:29.921
Did you get the earrings?

10:30.004 --> 10:31.173
I did.
Thank you.

10:31.256 --> 10:32.840
My mother's.
Two-carat diamonds.

10:32.924 --> 10:34.091
For tonight.

10:34.176 --> 10:35.677
There's nothing
quite like diamond earrings.

10:35.760 --> 10:36.761
Shall we begin?

10:38.513 --> 10:41.141
Uh, this year, we're handling
the arrival a bit differently.

10:41.224 --> 10:44.060
You'll be escorted to the rotunda
for a photo op with the leadership

10:44.144 --> 10:46.354
before going to the holding room.

10:46.438 --> 10:49.649
I don't need to go to the holding room.
You can take me directly to the gallery.

10:49.732 --> 10:52.277
Yes, that's fine.
Whatever the First Lady prefers.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.362
And we'll need
two separate motorcades after.

10:54.446 --> 10:56.573
I'll be going straight to the airport.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.533
- Two motorcades, then.
- Yes, sir.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.411
I'd like to brief you
on the list of special guests attending...

11:01.494 --> 11:02.829
This all seems pretty straightforward.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.289
I'm good if you are.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.499
Yes, I'm fine.
Thank you so very much.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.755
Do you have a moment?

11:16.384 --> 11:17.760
How's Elizabeth?

11:17.844 --> 11:19.221
She sends her regards.

11:19.304 --> 11:20.972
I'll bet she does.

11:21.055 --> 11:22.307
And the campaign?

11:23.641 --> 11:25.268
Still exploring viability.

11:26.311 --> 11:27.562
Doris isn't on board yet?

11:27.645 --> 11:29.231
Uh, we'll see.

11:29.314 --> 11:30.648
What have you offered her?

11:32.108 --> 11:34.819
Well, I want to put together
a solid campaign strategy with LeAnn

11:34.902 --> 11:37.154
before engaging her again.

11:37.239 --> 11:40.992
Well, if you need my help, let me know.
She and I were very close when I was whip.

11:41.075 --> 11:44.496
- You've got a lot on your plate.
- No, it's no trouble at all.

11:44.579 --> 11:46.122
I'll let you know.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.624
See you tonight.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.432
You ready to prep, sir?

12:04.516 --> 12:07.226
- I need to make some changes.
- I'll call the speech writers.

12:07.310 --> 12:10.062
No, I wanna do these myself.
And track down Calista.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.814
We have to make room
for one more guest.

12:11.898 --> 12:12.982
Yes, sir.

12:37.299 --> 12:39.301
Oh! Ah.

12:39.384 --> 12:40.718
What's that?

12:40.802 --> 12:43.346
I'm having it removed.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.393
Well, that's too bad.
I liked it.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.019
Hmm, time to move on.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.438
From what?

12:52.772 --> 12:54.982
From the me that needed a tattoo.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.569
I don't have much time.

12:58.653 --> 13:00.780
When do you have to be at the Capitol?

13:00.863 --> 13:02.907
Less than an hour.

13:04.033 --> 13:06.202
- Whiskey or vodka?
- Vodka.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.999
How well do you know Doris Jones?

13:12.083 --> 13:16.796
Oh, uh, met her a few times.
I don't know her that well, though.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.590
- Why?
- Her daughter, Celia,

13:18.673 --> 13:22.301
wants me to help them get appropriations
for a breast cancer clinic.

13:22.385 --> 13:26.013
In return, they want to pad my campaign
with Texas money.

13:26.097 --> 13:28.683
- How much?
- Three million.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.142
To start.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.354
Her district doesn't have
that kind of money.

13:32.437 --> 13:35.189
Celia says they're courting donors
from outside the 30th.

13:35.272 --> 13:39.151
But one of my aides heard
that Claire Underwood and LeAnn Harvey

13:39.235 --> 13:41.821
were in Jones' office today.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.657
Huh...

13:44.741 --> 13:46.283
LeAnn's someone I know.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.955
Glendon Hill was courting her
a few years ago.

13:51.038 --> 13:52.415
Did she turn you down?

13:53.332 --> 13:54.959
We couldn't afford her.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.213
Look, I know you're out of the game,
but this is a lot of money.

13:59.296 --> 14:02.008
If it's legit, it could really help me.
But if it's not, I...

14:02.091 --> 14:04.677
I'll talk to LeAnn
and see what I can find out.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.013
Here.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.975
I want to taste you first.

14:51.641 --> 14:53.267
Hey!

15:09.325 --> 15:11.202
<i>This is a special report.</i>

15:11.285 --> 15:13.663
<i>President Francis Underwood's
State of the Union address</i>

15:13.746 --> 15:16.332
<i>to a joint session of Congress.</i>

15:17.750 --> 15:20.294
<i>Tonight the eyes of the world
are on Washington.</i>

15:20.377 --> 15:23.881
<i>President Underwood will take the stage
in just a few minutes...</i>

15:24.882 --> 15:26.468
Take the food away.

15:26.551 --> 15:28.135
You didn't eat your lunch,
Mrs. Hale.

15:28.219 --> 15:30.096
Yeah, well, I didn't feel well.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.806
Then you really should eat dinner.
Your medication...

15:31.889 --> 15:34.183
Please don't make me
ask you again, Michael.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.769
Just take it away.
The smell of it is making me ill.

15:38.229 --> 15:39.522
Yes, ma'am.

15:42.149 --> 15:45.903
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the First Lady of the United States.</i>

16:02.795 --> 16:06.298
- Celia.
- Thank you so much for arranging this.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.468
It's a big honor to be sitting
next to you.

16:24.316 --> 16:28.320
Mr. Speaker,
the President of the United States.

17:08.986 --> 17:12.239
- Interesting place to watch the SOTU.
- Ah.

17:12.323 --> 17:14.992
It's more fun this way.
You know, hanging with the hoi polloi.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.746
So, what brings you to D.C.?

17:18.829 --> 17:21.790
Well, all of Congress in town,
it's good for hustling work.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.460
Since when do you hustle?
You turn people away.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.713
How'd you know I was in town?

17:26.796 --> 17:29.090
I might be retired,
but I still have my ear to the ground.

17:30.257 --> 17:33.553
So that's true? The great Remy Danton
has hung up his jersey?

17:33.636 --> 17:37.014
I've never felt better.

17:37.098 --> 17:39.475
- Don't tell me this is a social visit.
- No.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.144
- Well, if it isn't business...
- It's business.

17:42.228 --> 17:43.868
- <i>Members of Congress...</i>
- Okay.

17:43.938 --> 17:45.356
<i>- ...I have the high privilege...</i>
- So...

17:45.439 --> 17:48.150
- Oh, hold on. The show is starting.
<i>- ...of presenting to you,</i>

17:48.234 --> 17:49.986
<i>the President of the United States.</i>

18:01.956 --> 18:02.957
<i>Thank you.</i>

18:04.709 --> 18:05.835
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

18:07.419 --> 18:11.382
<i>Thank you. Mr. Speaker,
Mr. Vice President,</i>

18:11.465 --> 18:15.177
<i>members of Congress,
my fellow Americans.</i>

18:15.261 --> 18:16.721
<i>One year ago,</i>

18:16.804 --> 18:19.849
<i>when I gave this address
for the first time,</i>

18:19.932 --> 18:23.019
<i>it was during a very different period
for our country.</i>

18:23.770 --> 18:27.273
Our nation was recovering
from a political scandal

18:27.356 --> 18:30.234
and a trade crisis with China.

18:30.317 --> 18:34.781
Before you stood a president
no one had elected.

18:34.864 --> 18:39.661
But that same man stands before you now,
and the darkness is behind us.

18:39.744 --> 18:43.039
The state of the union is bright,
and getting brighter.

18:51.005 --> 18:52.840
We've had our challenges, yes.

18:52.924 --> 18:54.717
Particularly with Russia.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.679
There were some tense moments,
to be sure,

18:57.762 --> 19:00.597
and yet we overcame those tensions.

19:00.682 --> 19:03.976
President Petrov
let us continue to build trust

19:04.060 --> 19:07.271
and show that we've learned
from our experiences last year.

19:07.354 --> 19:10.566
And I'd personally like to acknowledge
the First Lady,

19:10.650 --> 19:14.654
who led the way
in repairing those burned bridges.

19:22.203 --> 19:24.914
She's getting more applause
than the president.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.498
Good for you, isn't it?

19:28.084 --> 19:30.252
Quite a high-profile client.

19:30.336 --> 19:31.921
Who told you that?

19:32.004 --> 19:35.216
- Just a guess.
- No, you guessed wrong.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.888
So what do you know
about big Texas donors...

19:40.972 --> 19:42.849
who care enough
about a poor Dallas district

19:42.932 --> 19:45.852
to donate money
to a campaign in California?

19:45.935 --> 19:47.186
That went right over my head.

19:48.437 --> 19:51.273
First Lady was in Dallas.
You were in Dallas.

19:51.357 --> 19:52.942
The First Lady is here.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.777
Now you're here.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.864
I think you have far too much time
on your hands, Remy.

19:57.947 --> 20:01.200
Your fingerprints
are all over this money.

20:09.751 --> 20:12.044
You're working for Jackie Sharp now?

20:12.128 --> 20:14.338
No. Just friends.

20:16.257 --> 20:19.051
- Just friends, huh?
- Yeah.

20:21.804 --> 20:24.265
I think your fingerprints
are all over her.

20:27.434 --> 20:28.602
How about this?

20:30.062 --> 20:33.024
You don't poke around in my shit...

20:33.941 --> 20:35.985
and I won't poke around in yours.

20:37.069 --> 20:40.197
It was good to see you, Remy.
Don't get too soft in retirement.

20:44.035 --> 20:45.494
<i>Now, it's considered uncouth</i>

20:45.577 --> 20:47.663
<i>for a president
who's in the midst of a campaign,</i>

20:47.747 --> 20:51.250
<i>to talk directly about
the upcoming election, but tonight,</i>

20:51.333 --> 20:52.584
I feel compelled.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.921
Because the votes our electorate casts

20:55.004 --> 20:59.091
during the current primaries
and the general election in November

20:59.175 --> 21:03.512
will have a profound impact
on everyone in this room.

21:03.595 --> 21:09.185
Some of us, myself included,
may find ourselves out of a job.

21:09.268 --> 21:13.480
If we want to keep our jobs,
we have to listen to the American people.

21:13.564 --> 21:16.776
We have to work harder!
We have to deliver!

21:21.238 --> 21:24.075
Just like Doris Jones.

21:24.158 --> 21:27.954
She has kept her job in Congress
for 34 years

21:28.037 --> 21:31.540
because she never relented
in the face of adversity.

21:31.623 --> 21:36.253
In fact, just today, she called me
about a breast cancer clinic

21:36.337 --> 21:39.673
she has been fighting for
over the past decade.

21:39.756 --> 21:41.175
Now, her plan is bold.

21:41.258 --> 21:44.804
<i>A VA hospital expansion
open to the general public,</i>

21:44.887 --> 21:46.430
<i>financed by federal money.</i>

21:46.513 --> 21:51.393
<i>A bold plan that will significantly
increase successful diagnoses</i>

21:51.477 --> 21:55.147
<i>and treatment through education,
screenings, and affordable care.</i>

22:02.321 --> 22:04.740
<i>Now, she's gotten resistance,
time and again...</i>

22:04.824 --> 22:07.701
<i>from the Veterans Affairs administration,</i>

22:07.784 --> 22:10.121
<i>from her colleagues in Congress...</i>

22:10.204 --> 22:12.206
- Can you turn it up a bit?
<i>- ...from those who don't want to see</i>

22:12.289 --> 22:15.459
<i>government funds
going to Planned Parenthood.</i>

22:15.542 --> 22:20.672
<i>And yet, when she called me today,
she was just as passionate about</i>

22:20.756 --> 22:25.844
this clinic as she was when she first
brought it up to me ten years ago.

22:31.558 --> 22:35.437
Well, Doris, it worked.

22:35.521 --> 22:38.149
I'll be working with
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs,

22:38.232 --> 22:42.028
HUD and the congressional leaders
to get you that clinic.

22:42.111 --> 22:44.613
Because of you,
we'll save lives.

22:57.876 --> 23:02.506
And that is exactly the sort of leadership
the American people want.

23:02.589 --> 23:04.466
More leaders like Doris Jones.

23:05.092 --> 23:07.553
And when she retires
at the end of this term,

23:07.636 --> 23:10.139
I'm delighted to say
that her daughter, Celia,

23:10.222 --> 23:15.519
will run for the open seat to continue
delivering just like her mother has.

23:15.602 --> 23:17.771
No fucking way.

23:21.858 --> 23:25.404
<i>And I, for one, will support your
candidacy with everything I've got.</i>

23:25.487 --> 23:27.614
<i>And I know Claire will, as well.</i>

23:33.245 --> 23:35.164
<i>Texans are tenacious.</i>

23:35.247 --> 23:39.126
<i>I'm proud to be married to one,
and I'm proud to have served with one,</i>

23:39.210 --> 23:40.461
like Congresswoman Jones.

23:40.544 --> 23:43.089
Thank you, Doris,
for all your years of service,

23:43.172 --> 23:46.217
and thank you, Celia,
for picking up the mantle.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.653
Doris said
her daughter spoke out of turn,

24:06.737 --> 24:09.865
that she didn't know about the deal
she was brokering with Underwood.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.742
<i>Did you connect with LeAnn?</i>

24:14.370 --> 24:16.372
No, I didn't.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.165
She said she couldn't meet
until tomorrow.

24:18.249 --> 24:19.958
<i>Well, I guess
there's no point now, anyway.</i>

24:20.042 --> 24:21.960
<i>If the White House is
orchestrating the funding,</i>

24:22.044 --> 24:23.920
<i>Underwood's not gonna want my help.</i>

24:24.005 --> 24:26.590
<i>Fuck!
I really could've used that money.</i>

24:26.673 --> 24:29.260
Well, when it looks too good to be true...

24:29.343 --> 24:30.719
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

24:31.845 --> 24:33.430
<i>When am I gonna see you again?</i>

24:34.348 --> 24:37.143
Um... I don't know.

24:38.644 --> 24:41.730
I've been... feeling a bit stir-crazy.

24:43.065 --> 24:45.192
If I'm retired,
I should probably travel some.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.237
<i>Well, you could travel to California.</i>

24:49.280 --> 24:51.823
<i>I'll be there more than here
until November.</i>

24:51.907 --> 24:53.075
Yeah, maybe.

24:54.743 --> 24:56.078
<i>Or don't.</i>

24:57.204 --> 24:58.664
<i>You know how to reach me.</i>

25:19.435 --> 25:20.644
<i>Do you think it was Remy?</i>

25:20.727 --> 25:23.189
Highly doubtful.
I made it clear what we knew.

25:23.272 --> 25:24.565
<i>He knows you have proof?</i>

25:24.648 --> 25:26.983
He knows that I know.
Not that I have proof.

25:27.068 --> 25:28.860
<i>Maybe we shouldn't have
played that card yet.</i>

25:28.944 --> 25:31.280
Remy was connecting the dots.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.157
<i>I needed to put the brakes on him.</i>

25:33.240 --> 25:36.118
Well, if it wasn't him,
Doris must've gone to Francis himself.

25:36.202 --> 25:37.369
She saw an opening and...

25:37.453 --> 25:39.253
Ma'am,
there's been a change of plans.

25:39.288 --> 25:41.790
Uh, hold on.
What change of plans?

25:41.873 --> 25:43.834
We're taking you back to the White House.

25:43.917 --> 25:45.669
No, we're going to Andrews.

25:45.752 --> 25:47.754
I'm sorry,
this is direct from the president.

25:50.257 --> 25:51.967
This is not gonna be
as difficult as it seems.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.927
Now, Terry's gonna be in touch
with Veteran Affairs

25:54.010 --> 25:55.721
first thing tomorrow
to draft an amendment.

25:55.804 --> 25:58.765
And if the Republicans give us
any resistance in committee,

25:58.849 --> 26:00.267
I'll start making calls.

26:00.351 --> 26:03.104
No reason why this can't get to the floor
before the end of the session.

26:03.187 --> 26:05.356
Well, thank you, Mr. President.

26:05.439 --> 26:08.066
Thank yourself.
You played this well.

26:08.150 --> 26:09.401
How did you play it?

26:09.485 --> 26:11.320
Well, now, that's our little secret,
isn't it?

26:11.403 --> 26:12.779
I'll walk you out.

26:12.863 --> 26:15.866
Uh, Mr. President, I got this.

26:23.081 --> 26:24.416
Oh, Claire.

26:25.542 --> 26:28.462
Didn't the president
make the most wonderful speech?

26:28.545 --> 26:31.257
Oh, he certainly did.

26:31.340 --> 26:33.842
And I thank you
for convincing the president

26:33.925 --> 26:36.553
to mention Celia in his remarks.

26:36.637 --> 26:38.430
Well, it was my pleasure.

26:39.681 --> 26:40.961
- Good night.
- Good night.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.393
Good night, Claire.

27:10.337 --> 27:11.838
We had a deal.

27:11.922 --> 27:12.964
I showed up.

27:13.048 --> 27:16.051
And used that opportunity
to undermine the campaign.

27:16.134 --> 27:17.636
Why didn't you just ask me?

27:17.719 --> 27:19.305
If you needed the clinic
to convince Doris...

27:19.388 --> 27:20.597
You don't want me to run, Francis.

27:20.681 --> 27:23.725
That's right, I don't.
But we'd reached an understanding.

27:23.809 --> 27:26.437
I think you said
what you wanted me to hear.

27:26.520 --> 27:27.938
Well, then you misread me.

27:30.607 --> 27:33.610
I am looking out for myself.
Just like you are.

27:33.694 --> 27:34.774
And where did that get you,

27:34.820 --> 27:37.948
looking out for yourself
instead of looking out for us?

27:38.031 --> 27:40.492
The 30th is dead now.
You know that.

27:40.576 --> 27:41.743
You think I'm giving up?

27:41.827 --> 27:43.620
What, you're gonna run
against the Joneses?

27:43.704 --> 27:45.372
You'll make a fool of yourself, Claire.

27:45.456 --> 27:47.123
The odds were against you
even with their blessing.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.585
Now, I hoped you'd reach
that conclusion on your own.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.421
But instead, you lied to me.

27:54.715 --> 27:56.717
Now, I can't force you to see reason.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.637
But I will not allow you
to become dangerous.

28:13.775 --> 28:14.943
I'll take one.

28:21.157 --> 28:22.243
Take mine.

28:27.498 --> 28:30.542
Claire, look...

28:30.626 --> 28:33.504
When I win the general,
then we can concentrate

28:33.587 --> 28:36.340
on a Senate seat for you in Texas.

28:36.423 --> 28:38.759
You don't want to be in the House, anyway.

28:38.842 --> 28:41.845
And neither of us could have predicted
a Heather Dunbar,

28:41.928 --> 28:43.764
or how formidable she'd be.

28:43.847 --> 28:47.017
We are fighting for our lives here.

28:47.726 --> 28:52.022
And when you run, you wanna do so
from a position of strength.

28:53.064 --> 28:54.900
It's about timing.

29:00.071 --> 29:02.616
Maybe it's too soon.
Maybe you're right.

29:05.536 --> 29:06.953
But I need to think.

29:08.455 --> 29:09.540
Fair enough.

29:09.623 --> 29:10.624
I can't do that here.

29:10.707 --> 29:12.083
Back in Texas?

29:13.126 --> 29:14.753
I'm not sure how long I'll need.

29:14.836 --> 29:16.087
Well, take as long as you want.

29:19.007 --> 29:20.259
I should get going.

29:20.342 --> 29:22.303
It's late. You sure you don't
want to spend the night?

29:22.386 --> 29:25.221
- Well, Mother was expecting me.
- All right.

29:27.516 --> 29:29.685
I'll walk myself out.
You enjoy your drink.

29:55.126 --> 29:58.004
You know, there was a boy that lived
down the street from me in Gaffney.

29:58.088 --> 30:00.507
About my age.
His name was Walter Wryson.

30:00.591 --> 30:03.635
He used to run away from home all the time
and come to our house.

30:03.719 --> 30:05.178
Not for any good reason.

30:05.261 --> 30:08.139
His daddy didn't beat him.
He had clothes on his back.

30:08.223 --> 30:10.016
The Wrysons had
way more money than we did,

30:10.100 --> 30:13.562
but run away he would, at least once
a month and come straight to our place.

30:13.645 --> 30:18.484
Now, usually, my mother would call his
mother and she'd come and fetch him.

30:18.567 --> 30:21.277
But about the ninth
or tenth time this happened,

30:21.362 --> 30:25.156
Walter ran outside,
climbed up into a tree in our backyard,

30:25.240 --> 30:26.950
and wouldn't come down for nothing.

30:27.033 --> 30:28.660
Now, my mama said to his mama,

30:28.744 --> 30:30.203
"Why don't you let us keep him
for a while,

30:30.286 --> 30:32.247
until he feels like coming home?"

30:32.331 --> 30:37.127
But man, oh, man,
that boy was stubborn.

30:38.754 --> 30:40.756
Night came, and he was still up there.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.634
No food, no water... no toilet.

30:43.717 --> 30:47.888
And just before I went to bed, I looked
out my window and I heard him crying.

30:47.971 --> 30:50.682
And I said, "Walter,
why don't you come on down?"

30:50.766 --> 30:53.059
And he just shook his head no.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.855
Well, the next morning, I woke up,
I looked out the window

30:56.938 --> 30:58.774
and Walter was still up in that tree.

30:59.858 --> 31:03.654
So after breakfast,
I walked over with a plate of eggs...

31:03.737 --> 31:05.321
and I asked him if he wanted some.

31:05.406 --> 31:07.449
And again, he just shook his head.

31:08.742 --> 31:09.910
And I got angry.

31:11.077 --> 31:15.081
That boy had a good house, a good family,
the sort I would've killed for,

31:15.165 --> 31:16.792
and he didn't even realize it.

31:18.794 --> 31:21.672
So I went into the tool shed
and I took out an ax.

31:21.755 --> 31:23.507
And I said to Walter...

31:23.590 --> 31:26.301
"You want to know what it's really like
to live at my house?"

31:26.385 --> 31:30.096
And I gave that tree a good whack.
And Walter cried out, but I kept on.

31:30.180 --> 31:33.183
I mean, you've never heard screams
like the one coming from Walter

31:33.266 --> 31:35.226
as I chopped at that tree.

31:35.310 --> 31:36.895
He pissed his pants,

31:36.978 --> 31:40.816
and it came raining down on the ground,
but I didn't pay it no mind.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.859
I just kept whacking away.

31:44.319 --> 31:45.404
Well...

31:45.487 --> 31:48.740
it didn't take long before Walter was on
the ground and running back to his house.

31:48.824 --> 31:51.034
You see, all he needed
was a little motivation.

31:52.368 --> 31:54.621
So I'll give Claire some time.

31:54.705 --> 31:55.789
But for her sake,

31:55.872 --> 31:59.501
I hope she comes out of her tree
before I have to bring out my ax.

32:04.631 --> 32:05.799
Hey.

32:11.054 --> 32:14.766
He wants me to hold off for Senate.

32:14.850 --> 32:16.267
I told him I would think about it.

32:16.351 --> 32:19.855
- So it's over?
- Oh, no, it's not over.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.107
He endorsed Celia on national television.

32:22.190 --> 32:24.192
Forget the 30th.

32:24.275 --> 32:26.987
We need to think bigger.
This cycle.

32:30.323 --> 32:33.284
Then we need to talk seriously
about my compensation.

32:39.165 --> 32:41.292
- He on?
- Yes, sir.

32:49.593 --> 32:50.761
I'm ready.

32:50.844 --> 32:52.345
<i>I'll connect you now, sir.</i>

32:52.428 --> 32:54.556
<i>President Petrov,
you are now on with the president.</i>

32:54.640 --> 32:56.808
<i>Good evening, Mr. President.</i>

32:56.892 --> 32:58.226
Good morning, Mr. President.

32:58.309 --> 33:00.186
Your speech was good.

33:00.270 --> 33:02.188
Perhaps, a bit too...

33:02.272 --> 33:03.482
optimistic, hmm?

33:03.565 --> 33:05.484
<i>I meant what I said
about Russia.</i>

33:05.567 --> 33:07.944
It's just words.
They mean very little.

33:08.028 --> 33:11.740
<i>I'm willing to back them up with action.
First, we should talk about a bailout.</i>

33:11.823 --> 33:14.535
<i>I'm willing to work with the IMF
to get you what you need.</i>

33:14.618 --> 33:19.665
And second, as a gesture of good faith,
we'd like to return Igor Milkin to Russia.

33:19.748 --> 33:21.166
You should've done so already.

33:21.249 --> 33:23.585
<i>I need your assurances he'll get a trial.</i>

33:23.669 --> 33:26.087
- What do you care about Igor Milkin?
<i>- I don't.</i>

33:26.171 --> 33:27.422
You can send him to Siberia

33:27.506 --> 33:30.634
and let him die of black lung
in a coal mine, for all I care.

33:30.717 --> 33:32.468
But I do care about your economy.

33:32.553 --> 33:35.639
You keep killing high-profile businessmen
and seizing their assets.

33:35.722 --> 33:37.641
- That's no...
<i>- You mean, traitors?</i>

33:37.724 --> 33:41.144
Look, I am aware that they were
plotting a coup, but that still doesn't...

33:41.227 --> 33:44.731
Yes, because you orchestrated it.

33:44.815 --> 33:47.609
- Excuse me?
<i>- Why else would Milkin fly to America?</i>

33:47.693 --> 33:49.235
We had nothing to do with this.

33:49.319 --> 33:53.448
You... you lied to me
about the Jordan Valley,

33:53.532 --> 33:55.116
you lied to me about Corrigan.

33:56.618 --> 33:58.829
I am not trying to replace you, Viktor.

33:58.912 --> 34:01.372
<i>I'm trying to help you.
But you have to help me.</i>

34:01.456 --> 34:04.500
These threats of reducing
your oil production, it won't work.

34:04.585 --> 34:08.839
You think jacking up energy prices
is gonna hurt us, but it's just extortion.

34:08.922 --> 34:12.717
And I will not respond to extortion.
Now, I'll send your traitor back,

34:12.801 --> 34:16.137
<i>but you've got to stop seizing companies
and making people disappear.</i>

34:16.221 --> 34:20.225
Igor Milkin is worse than a traitor.
He's an American puppet.

34:20.308 --> 34:22.393
<i>Regime change, that's extortion.</i>

34:22.476 --> 34:25.313
Yes, but they acted on their own.
You're being paranoid.

34:25.396 --> 34:27.357
Send him back. No terms.

34:27.440 --> 34:30.318
<i>We're not going to get anywhere
if you're not willing to negotiate.</i>

34:30.400 --> 34:33.529
Well... then I believe we're finished.

34:33.614 --> 34:37.324
And I believe you're right.
Thank you, Mr. President.

34:39.703 --> 34:43.206
Put Milkin in a secure location.
He's not going anywhere.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.047
Mr. Milkin.

34:51.130 --> 34:52.257
I need you to come with me.

34:52.340 --> 34:54.217
Where are we going?

34:54.300 --> 34:55.969
A detainment facility.

34:56.052 --> 34:57.428
I'm not being deported, am I?

34:57.512 --> 34:59.848
No, we're going to process
your asylum request.

36:13.588 --> 36:14.798
Claire?

36:20.095 --> 36:23.264
If you wanna smoke,
you should smoke.

36:23.348 --> 36:25.516
I only wanted one drag.

36:27.227 --> 36:32.065
He hated how you used to go down
to the stables with your cigarettes.

36:33.692 --> 36:34.985
I didn't realize he knew.

36:35.068 --> 36:38.780
He adored you.
You got away with murder.

36:41.324 --> 36:42.868
Did you wait up for me?

36:42.951 --> 36:45.495
No, it's the medication.

36:45.578 --> 36:49.415
Keeps me tired all day,
and then I'm up all night.

36:51.209 --> 36:54.129
I... I watched the speech.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.257
What are you gonna do?

36:57.340 --> 37:00.301
It's late, Mother.
Let's talk in the morning.

37:00.385 --> 37:05.098
By the way, those earrings are beautiful.
I noticed 'em on TV.

37:06.892 --> 37:08.559
They're Francis' mother's earrings.

37:08.643 --> 37:11.938
- They look like they're over a carat.
- Two carats.

37:12.022 --> 37:14.482
No doubt she stole them from someone.

37:17.027 --> 37:20.530
The Underwoods never cease to amaze.

37:20.613 --> 37:22.407
Mother...

37:22.490 --> 37:24.409
I'm going to need some money.

37:26.036 --> 37:27.370
For the clinic? Isn't...

37:27.453 --> 37:30.665
A million five for LeAnn
and some on top of that.

37:30.749 --> 37:34.002
Well, I thought your campaign was dead.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.712
It is,
but I still need her to work for me.

37:36.797 --> 37:40.050
But, what for? I mean,
I can't ask my friends for money and...

37:40.133 --> 37:41.301
Our money.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.849
You mean my money.

37:47.933 --> 37:50.435
Don't fight me on this.

37:50.518 --> 37:51.812
Daddy would've done it,
no questions asked.

37:51.895 --> 37:55.398
Yes, well... I'm not as foolish as he was.

37:55.481 --> 37:57.108
Well, I'll just have to sell the estate.

37:57.192 --> 37:58.609
You what?

37:58.693 --> 38:01.446
The money is in the trust,
but the land is in my name.

38:01.529 --> 38:04.574
- You wouldn't dare.
- Well, I'm asking for your help.

38:04.657 --> 38:06.742
- If you refuse to give it...
- Help?

38:06.827 --> 38:10.205
You didn't lift a finger
to help me when I got sick.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.790
You didn't tell me you were sick!

38:11.873 --> 38:14.375
Because you had turned your back on me!

38:14.459 --> 38:17.295
Oh, you are such a disappointment.

38:19.464 --> 38:23.093
You don't want me to sell this house
out from under you, but I will.

38:26.471 --> 38:28.431
I am the mother.

38:28.514 --> 38:30.683
I am the mother!
