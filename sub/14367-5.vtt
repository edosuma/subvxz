Man:
All right...

00:56.973 --> 00:57.223
Quiet down, now.

00:57.307 --> 00:58.433
Time to

00:58.516 --> 01:00.602
draw the name

01:00.685 --> 01:03.772
{\an1}of the new morning
announcement person, so...

01:03.855 --> 01:06.733
{\an1}let's have a hand
for last month's announcer

Mr. Chet Zipper.

01:13.323 --> 01:14.866

01:14.949 --> 01:16.326
{\an8}Thank you.

01:16.409 --> 01:19.078
{\an8}(<i> in monotone</i> ):
Um... I, I really enjoyed

01:19.162 --> 01:21.664
{\an8}making the morning and
afternoon announcements...

01:21.748 --> 01:24.250
{\an8}(<i> yawning loudly</i> )

01:24.334 --> 01:27.212
{\an7}...every morning
and afternoon.

01:27.295 --> 01:27.796
{\an8}Um, thanks.

01:27.879 --> 01:29.923
I heard Mipsy and Lanie

01:30.006 --> 01:32.550
got caught talking
during the math final

01:32.634 --> 01:36.846
{\an5}and now they have to take
the whole class over
in summer school.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.974
No, Ginger, they just have to
make up the past three tests.

01:40.058 --> 01:42.101
{\an1}I've got a total "in"
with the janitor.

01:42.185 --> 01:44.729
{\an1}You wouldn't believe
the notes people throw out.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.397
They were passing
notes, too?

01:46.481 --> 01:47.649
Those girls sure live

Me? (<i> laughing</i> )

{\an1}Oh, this is just the most

02:09.628 --> 02:10.630
Luckians, I solemnly promise

02:10.713 --> 02:13.883
to uphold the dignity
of this prestigious position.

{\an5}Actually,
she practically
congratulated <i> Podie.</i>

02:47.834 --> 02:49.752
Podie doesn't mind.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.671
{\an1}Let's go.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.974
Hoods, great news!

03:03.057 --> 03:04.934
I found Siamese earthworms.

03:05.018 --> 03:05.768
Take a look.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.937
Sorry, Carl, I can't.

03:08.021 --> 03:11.316
I have lice and got to
stay away from people.

03:11.399 --> 03:13.192
Whoa, let me see.

(<i> whistles</i> )

03:17.572 --> 03:19.032
Six-legged beauties.

03:19.115 --> 03:21.034
I get to use
this really evil shampoo

03:21.117 --> 03:23.536
and a fine-toothed comb
to get rid of them.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.623
{\an5}Man, I hate to see
such prime specimens
go to waste.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.666
{\an5}Mind if I
take some samples
before you kill them?

03:28.750 --> 03:32.337
My lice are your lice.

03:40.845 --> 03:42.555
(<i> chuckles</i> )

03:42.639 --> 03:46.893
Hoods, I am going to breed these
pups and create a lice circus.

03:46.976 --> 03:48.144
We'll be famous.

03:48.227 --> 03:49.979
Our names and faces
will be plastered

03:50.063 --> 03:51.564
on every billboard in town.

03:51.648 --> 03:54.567
Once this thing takes off,
there will be no stopping it.

03:54.651 --> 03:55.568
How about money?

03:55.652 --> 03:58.655
For a circus, you'll need
tents and rings and...

03:58.738 --> 04:02.867
So? We get a rich investor
to bankroll the whole thing.

04:02.951 --> 04:05.244
Blake Gripling, for instance.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.793
(<i> Dodie vocalizing loudly</i> )

Sounds good.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.675

04:18.757 --> 04:20.343
Oh, nothing,
I'm just warming up.

04:20.426 --> 04:22.845
It's important that vocal cords
be malleable.

04:22.929 --> 04:26.808
{\an5}An on-air personality
never knows what words
she might have to pronounce

04:26.891 --> 04:27.642

(<i> gargling</i> )

04:31.145 --> 04:33.272
Well, break a leg, Dodie.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.400
{\an1}Metaphorically speaking,
of course.

04:38.486 --> 04:40.613
{\an1}Oh... oh, Mrs. Fleming,
a word?

04:40.697 --> 04:43.783
{\an1}I mean, well, as one
professional to another.

04:43.866 --> 04:46.077
Um... okay.

{\an1}read a bit, well...
flat

04:51.165 --> 04:53.918
{\an1}and since we don't want
people tuning out

04:54.002 --> 04:56.629
{\an1}mind if I tweak them
a bit?

04:56.713 --> 04:57.964
Fine.

Good a.m., Luckians.

Dodie Bishop here.

05:10.393 --> 05:13.896
Um, the chocolate pudding
on the cafeteria ceiling

05:13.980 --> 05:17.275
will be cleaned off as soon as
the janitor can find his ladder

05:17.358 --> 05:20.153
which is--
quote, unquote-- missing.

05:20.236 --> 05:21.654
(<i> both laugh</i> )

05:21.738 --> 05:23.781
{\an5}Dodie:
Has anyone checked
the boy's bathroom?

05:23.865 --> 05:28.953
{\an5}Until that time, please
don't sit under the pudding,
as it may drip.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.663
A drip of chocolate pudding

05:30.747 --> 05:32.665
nearly landed
on Courtney Gripling.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.083
Hmm...

05:34.167 --> 05:35.418
But, miraculously

05:35.501 --> 05:37.795
the drip slanted sideways
at the last moment

05:37.879 --> 05:39.380
completely missing her...

05:39.464 --> 05:41.215
And my
all-cream ensemble.

05:41.299 --> 05:44.218
...and her all-cream ensemble.

Ooh!

And now for "Dodie's Word."

hit the rocks on the class trip.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.896
Amanda Lopez caught her steady
of four months, Robert Frisch

{\an5}kissing Dionne Whitley
behind the stuffed moose
at the natural history museum...

05:59.984 --> 06:02.820
How does she know that?

06:02.904 --> 06:04.989
I don't even know that.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.699
That girl's good!

06:06.783 --> 06:08.659
Courtney really
said that?

06:08.743 --> 06:09.827
Uh-huh.

06:09.911 --> 06:10.953
I know some gossip.

06:11.037 --> 06:14.373
It's about that whole
Mipsy/Lanie math final thing.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.459
It seems that we were way off...

06:16.542 --> 06:17.543
{\an3}Wait!

06:17.627 --> 06:19.670
{\an1}Uh, aren't

06:22.840 --> 06:24.509
Oh, Ginger,
that is so retro.

06:24.592 --> 06:25.676
Okay, now go ahead

06:25.760 --> 06:27.720
and don't leave out
anything.

06:27.804 --> 06:31.599
{\an1}Oh, okay, but, um, this is
strictly off the record.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.105
Carl:
I'm telling you, Blake, old boy.

06:37.188 --> 06:39.232
This is a very hot
investment opportunity.

06:39.315 --> 06:42.401
It's guaranteed
to make millions.

06:42.485 --> 06:46.280
{\an5}And I'm letting only
quality individuals
in on it.

06:47.573 --> 06:48.950
Hmm... I'm intrigued.

06:49.033 --> 06:52.328
{\an1}But what's your plan,
Foutley?

06:52.411 --> 06:56.082
To breed them and create
the world's first--

06:56.165 --> 06:58.292
and so far, only--
lice circus.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.211
Whoa! I... oof!

07:00.628 --> 07:02.463
Egads!

07:04.215 --> 07:07.468
Even a week ago, I might have
found this a tempting investment

07:07.552 --> 07:09.762
but right now,
my maggot farm

07:09.846 --> 07:12.890
is consuming all my time
and spare cash.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.392
(<i> scoffs</i> ) Maggots?

07:14.475 --> 07:17.353
Are you sure you want
the Gripling name

07:17.436 --> 07:20.022
attached to something
so... common?

07:20.106 --> 07:21.983
(<i> chuckles</i> )

07:22.066 --> 07:27.989
{\an5}Ah, but maggots don't
stay maggots forever,
Foutley, do they now?

07:28.072 --> 07:30.992
They metamorphose into flies!

07:31.075 --> 07:33.202
I'm not seeing the
fame angle here, Blake.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.580
You can watch flies for
free at the city dump.

07:35.663 --> 07:36.789
And we've done it, too.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.959
Ah, but herein lies
the ingenious part.

07:40.042 --> 07:44.380
Soon I'm going to introduce
food dye into their diets.

07:44.463 --> 07:45.464
When they turn into flies

07:45.548 --> 07:49.177
their wings will be
spectacular colors.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.470
It will only be
a matter of time

07:51.554 --> 07:53.931
before Blake Gripling
becomes known

07:54.015 --> 07:54.849
by a more famous
moniker...

07:54.932 --> 07:57.852
Fly Boy!

07:59.687 --> 08:02.565
Doesn't sound
very interesting.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.650
Well, good luck, Foutley.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.194
May the best plan win.

08:06.277 --> 08:08.321
You don't stand
a chance, Gripling!

08:08.404 --> 08:11.324
In the battle between
you and me...

08:11.407 --> 08:12.575
it's going to be me.

08:12.658 --> 08:14.827
Dodie:
Today's lunch will be Chef Bob's

08:14.911 --> 08:17.163
own specialty, chili con carne--

08:17.246 --> 08:19.957
a tasty recipe he got
from a jailed embezzler

08:20.041 --> 08:21.876
while working as sous chef

08:21.959 --> 08:24.378
at the state's
minimum security prison.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.714
{\an5}I didn't know Chef Bob
was a sous chef.

08:26.797 --> 08:28.549
I didn't know he
had a specialty.

08:28.633 --> 08:31.093
{\an1}I wonder if Chef Bob really
wanted everyone to know

08:31.177 --> 08:33.929
{\an1}he used to work
at a prison.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.183
(<i> gasps</i> )

08:38.267 --> 08:41.229
Luckians! Major news!

08:41.312 --> 08:45.441
Lucky Junior High has gotten
word that lice are on the loose.

08:45.524 --> 08:46.400
(<i> all gasp</i> )

08:46.484 --> 08:47.902
And, therefore, tomorrow

08:47.985 --> 08:50.905
there will be a lice check
by the school nurse.

08:50.988 --> 08:53.032
There will be absolutely
no exceptions.

08:53.115 --> 08:55.368
{\an1}From now on, I wash my hair
four times a day

08:55.451 --> 08:55.910
instead of the usual two.

08:55.993 --> 08:58.037
That should do it.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.122
Everyone knows lice
are only attracted

09:00.206 --> 09:02.291
to messy grossoids
with no fashion sense.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.877
Try not to panic, Macie.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.629
Okay, but you do realize

09:06.712 --> 09:09.048
this is how the bubonic
plague started...

09:09.131 --> 09:11.175
more or less.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.974
(<i> water running...</i> )

09:18.057 --> 09:20.059
{\an1}Archery?

09:20.142 --> 09:22.395
{\an1}When will that ever
come up in real life?

09:22.478 --> 09:23.646
You'd be surprised.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.273
Do you hear that?

09:25.356 --> 09:27.483
{\an1}Someone was taking
a shower?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.151
That has never happened

09:29.235 --> 09:32.154
in the history of
Lucky Junior High... ever.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.240
{\an1}Who would be
that desperate?

09:34.323 --> 09:35.199
Courtney and Miranda.

09:35.283 --> 09:38.911
I overheard them
talking...

09:41.747 --> 09:42.999
{\an1}Courtney,
care to comment

09:43.082 --> 09:44.917
{\an1}on making history
by using the shower?

09:45.001 --> 09:47.586
Well, we are in the
middle of an epidemic

09:47.670 --> 09:51.007
and La Courtney isn't taking
any chances... Dodie.

09:53.509 --> 09:54.302
Did you hear that?!

09:54.385 --> 09:57.096
Courtney Gripling
said "Dodie."

09:57.179 --> 10:00.182
She knows who I am.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.559
(<i> musical notes on p.a.</i> )

10:01.642 --> 10:03.602
Dodie:
Now for a special announcement.

10:03.686 --> 10:05.521
The school nurse
is sick with the flu

10:05.604 --> 10:07.148
and won't be able to conduct
the lice check.

10:07.231 --> 10:09.900
(<i> all sigh</i> )

10:09.984 --> 10:12.028
But at the very last minute

10:12.111 --> 10:17.366
{\an5}we were able to land that
incomparable angel of mercy,
Lois Foutley, R.N.

Oh, poor Ginger,

{\an1}Did Dodie have to

Why did the whole school
need to know?

10:44.143 --> 10:45.644
They would have
found out anyway

10:50.316 --> 10:52.026
Ginger, it's a hot story.

10:52.109 --> 10:53.361
I can't not report it

10:53.444 --> 10:55.905
just because it's about
a friend's mother.

We're talking about

You should know how
I feel about her

11:00.409 --> 11:03.079

you to my "Cirque du Fly."

11:36.695 --> 11:38.155
I'll try to fit it in.

I may be down,
but I am not out.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.991
You might as well
shred that invite.

I'm happy to report that I
just underwent the lice check

and I am nit-free.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.864
It was completely painless.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.365
Macie, think about it.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.618
I can't tell Dodie
anything anymore.

13:05.701 --> 13:08.537
{\an1}It will end up in
the morning announcements.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.581
{\an1}Where's the friendship
in that?

Please line up
in your home rooms

for being pretty, popular

14:18.482 --> 14:20.609

to move around.

What's this got to do
with the maggots?

16:03.295 --> 16:05.047
The light will
warm them up a bit.

I got to warn you

20:33.649 --> 20:35.901
{\an5}that if you keep
scrubbing like that,
you'll end up bald.

20:35.984 --> 20:38.153
I just want to be careful.

20:38.236 --> 20:40.322
I already rechecked you
and you do not

20:40.405 --> 20:41.990
{\an1}I repeat,
you do not have lice.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.617
{\an1}Besides, you're
running late

20:43.700 --> 20:45.911
{\an1}for your phone call
with Dodie and Macie.

20:45.994 --> 20:48.747
{\an1}Unless you and Dodie haven't
patched things up yet.

20:48.830 --> 20:51.124
How did you know about my fight
with Dodie?

20:51.208 --> 20:53.377
{\an1}Oh, Ginger,
the correct question is

20:53.460 --> 20:55.087
{\an1}how does a mother
not know?

20:55.170 --> 20:57.005
I overheard you talking.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.967
{\an1}Might be nice
if you made up, though.

21:00.050 --> 21:02.552
{\an1}People make mistakes,
you know?

21:02.636 --> 21:04.972
{\an1}Even me,
and I'm your mother.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.525
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

21:16.608 --> 21:18.485
{\an1}Hello?

21:18.568 --> 21:20.320
{\an1}Hi, Macie.

21:20.404 --> 21:20.904
Is it just
going to be

21:20.988 --> 21:23.532
the Two Musketeers
tonight?

21:23.615 --> 21:25.575
{\an1}Guess so.

21:25.659 --> 21:28.370
I'm going to need
a round of antibiotics.

21:28.453 --> 21:29.496
{\an3}(<i> beep</i> )

21:29.579 --> 21:31.832
That's my other line,
hold on.

21:31.915 --> 21:32.749
{\an3}Hello?

21:32.833 --> 21:34.042
Hi, Macie, it's me.

21:34.126 --> 21:37.254
{\an1}Oh, good, good,
Ginger's on the other line.

21:37.337 --> 21:38.422
Oh.

21:38.505 --> 21:39.506
I'm not sure

21:39.589 --> 21:41.758
{\an1}but I think maybe
the reason you called

21:41.842 --> 21:43.969
{\an1}is because you really
want to apologize.

21:44.052 --> 21:44.970
Well, I...

21:45.053 --> 21:46.096
Great, hold on!

21:46.179 --> 21:48.974
Ginger, I'm patching
Dodie in.

21:49.057 --> 21:50.183
Oh, but I...

21:50.267 --> 21:54.646
Ginger, Dodie has
something to tell you.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.565
Um, hi, Ginger,
um...

21:56.648 --> 21:58.942
Well, I...

21:59.026 --> 22:01.153
See, I really am...

22:01.236 --> 22:02.487
{\an1}Sorry?

22:02.571 --> 22:04.156
Yeah. I feel like...

22:04.239 --> 22:04.573
Such a jerk?

22:04.656 --> 22:06.867
Okay.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.535
I got out of control.

22:08.618 --> 22:10.746
I guess it all
went to my head

22:10.829 --> 22:12.998
and some other Dodie
took over.

22:13.081 --> 22:15.751
Well, a lot of the time
you were really good.

22:15.834 --> 22:19.046
You actually made me want to
try Chef Bob's special.

22:19.129 --> 22:20.464
(<i> Dodie laughs</i> )

22:20.547 --> 22:21.590
I promise

22:21.673 --> 22:23.258
tomorrow I lose the gossip

22:23.341 --> 22:25.969
and I go back to being
plain old Podie.

22:26.053 --> 22:29.598
{\an1}You know, it doesn't mean <i> we</i>
still can't gossip.

22:29.681 --> 22:30.515
{\an3}Right.

22:30.599 --> 22:33.310
Can you believe Miranda
used her cell phone

22:33.393 --> 22:34.728
in the middle
of volleyball?

22:34.811 --> 22:36.438
Who was she calling?

22:36.521 --> 22:38.023
It was that Ben guy.

22:38.106 --> 22:40.275
Seventh-grade Ben
or ninth-grade Ben?

22:40.358 --> 22:41.276
Ninth.

22:40.358 --> 22:41.276
{\an1}Ninth.

22:41.359 --> 22:43.862
