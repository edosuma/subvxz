01:00.667 --> 01:01.751
Daddy...

01:03.459 --> 01:05.501
Kimberly.

01:29.209 --> 01:30.667
Daddy, where's the car?

01:41.876 --> 01:43.709
Mama?

02:36.126 --> 02:37.709
Father Brian?

02:39.417 --> 02:40.376
Sorry to disturb.

02:40.667 --> 02:43.251
Yes of course.
Come in, Katherine.

02:46.709 --> 02:47.751
Sit down.

02:48.584 --> 02:49.834
Thank you Dawn.

02:53.584 --> 02:55.251
Mr. Walch tells me your recital's

02:55.417 --> 02:59.292
coming along very, very nicely.
Sorry I won't be around to see it,

02:59.501 --> 03:04.901
But I'm sure that you'll enjoy performing for your
friends and your parents all the same, won't you?

03:05.501 --> 03:06.667
Where are you going?

03:07.417 --> 03:09.917
I have some personal business in Albany.

03:12.667 --> 03:15.126
How long does it take to get to Albany?

03:17.292 --> 03:19.876
Oh...couple of hours...by train.

03:21.459 --> 03:26.126
So about the same exact time to
come back then, I guess...huh?

03:29.167 --> 03:30.501
Katherine...

03:34.167 --> 03:35.751
are you concerned about something?

03:41.667 --> 03:45.042
I mean just wish you could
stay and see my performance.

03:45.876 --> 03:46.709
That's all.

03:47.917 --> 03:52.001
Well, I'm sorry but this time
it just can't be helped.

03:56.584 --> 03:58.167
When do you come back?

04:00.917 --> 04:02.292
After the break...

04:03.792 --> 04:06.042
...with everyone else, I should imagine.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.251
Is something funny?

04:27.334 --> 04:28.626
Funny?

04:30.126 --> 04:32.376
No.
Why ?

04:34.792 --> 04:36.042
You smiled a little.

04:36.459 --> 04:37.292
I did?

04:39.667 --> 04:41.292
Yes you did.

04:53.251 --> 04:57.917
I was just thinking to say I hope
you have a fun time in Albany.

06:39.501 --> 06:40.792
Headache, you say ?

06:43.042 --> 06:45.667
and my throat kinda hurts when I swallow.

06:47.251 --> 06:48.292
You poor thing...

06:49.251 --> 06:51.834
It would be a shame to be sick over the break.

06:52.001 --> 06:53.042
I know...

06:56.334 --> 06:57.167
Here you are, dear.

07:09.876 --> 07:11.501
So you really think I should tell him?

07:12.334 --> 07:14.751
Rose, of course you have to tell him!

07:14.917 --> 07:17.834
It's like half his.
It's half his problem anyway.

07:18.001 --> 07:20.042
No it isn't.
Not really.

07:20.209 --> 07:21.542
Well it should be.

07:21.709 --> 07:25.209
He's the one who got you in this
situation in the first place.

07:25.417 --> 07:27.126
He knew exactly what he was doing.

07:27.334 --> 07:29.876
Like I didn't ?
He was doing it to me.

07:31.334 --> 07:32.417
And I was liking it.

07:35.459 --> 07:37.667
Don't laugh.
It's so not funny.

07:40.417 --> 07:42.209
Besides it's only been four days.

07:42.376 --> 07:43.626
I could still get it.

07:45.042 --> 07:46.834
You think you're going
to tell your parents ?

07:50.834 --> 07:55.709
Of course, everyone is excited
to have your parents come and

07:55.876 --> 07:59.001
tour the classrooms and share your life

07:59.167 --> 08:00.959
here at Bramford with them.

08:01.126 --> 08:02.501
But that doesn't mean

08:02.667 --> 08:07.084
there's going to be any change when
when it comes to con-duct ex-pec-ta-tions.

08:08.709 --> 08:11.876
If anything, conduct is more
important today than any other day

08:12.042 --> 08:16.917
because today we are all here
today representing Bramford.

08:17.126 --> 08:21.542
And that means that you are representing
all the young women who came before you

08:21.709 --> 08:24.209
and all the women who will follow you

08:24.376 --> 08:25.959
after you've moved on.

08:27.626 --> 08:29.167
Sound good?

08:29.917 --> 08:31.667
Sounds good...

08:32.126 --> 08:35.126
And if I don't see you before you
leave, have a great week off

08:35.292 --> 08:37.376
We'll see you on the...

09:31.334 --> 09:32.167
Rose !

09:33.709 --> 09:34.792
Where are you going ?

09:34.959 --> 09:37.334
I was gonna check out some of the performance.

09:38.751 --> 09:39.584
You okay?

09:39.959 --> 09:41.292
Yeah, of course

09:42.626 --> 09:43.834
Where are your parents ?

09:44.501 --> 09:46.709
They're waiting inside
so I better go.

09:48.709 --> 09:51.876
Okay, well...I'll see you
next week then, okay?

11:20.709 --> 11:21.626
Katherine...

11:22.167 --> 11:24.001
Have you checked your cellular phone?

11:24.334 --> 11:25.751
Maybe they called you there.

11:26.792 --> 11:28.584
I don't have one yet.

11:30.042 --> 11:31.876
They said maybe for my birthday.

11:37.542 --> 11:40.167
You know, bad weather coming in
all over the east coast an'

11:40.667 --> 11:42.126
maybe they got caught up in that.

11:42.667 --> 11:44.459
Planes get delayed.

11:45.501 --> 11:47.626
And Rose, what about you?

11:48.709 --> 11:52.292
I thought we got out on Friday so
I told my parents to come on Friday.

11:55.292 --> 11:56.417
Guess I spaced out.

11:57.334 --> 11:58.626
Were you able to reach them ?

11:59.042 --> 12:02.959
Yeah...it just may take a day or so
to change their plans.

12:03.167 --> 12:05.459
- A day?
- Yeah, 'cause they're...

12:06.626 --> 12:08.417
planning on coming
on Friday so they'll

12:08.584 --> 12:10.417
probably still come on Friday.

12:13.334 --> 12:15.501
All right, well...Miss Prescott
and Miss Drake

12:15.709 --> 12:18.376
will be here in any case.
Now do you hear that, Katherine?

12:19.084 --> 12:22.209
It happens that parents get confused and

12:22.376 --> 12:25.751
Worst case is they come on Friday
and everyone goes home

12:25.917 --> 12:28.417
and has a really nice break anyway

12:28.959 --> 12:31.876
After all...we can't let you live here.

12:33.501 --> 12:36.501
Rose,
Would you look after Kat

12:36.792 --> 12:38.292
until her parents arrive?

12:39.584 --> 12:42.042
I actually haven't been feeling very well.

12:43.251 --> 12:46.792
I have a really sore throat.
I was gonna stay in bed

12:58.001 --> 12:59.042
Uh, Miss Prescott,

12:59.751 --> 13:03.001
You will call Mr Cornish

13:03.167 --> 13:06.626
in a few hours, both on his home
phone and his mobile

13:06.834 --> 13:09.501
- Won't you?
- Of course we will.

13:10.542 --> 13:11.751
Sound good?

13:15.376 --> 13:16.209
Katherine ?

13:18.084 --> 13:19.376
Sounds good.

13:24.126 --> 13:25.667
Hey...dad.

13:29.167 --> 13:30.292
It's me.

13:32.459 --> 13:35.292
Just calling to see where
you and mom were...

13:35.834 --> 13:37.542
if you're coming...

13:41.334 --> 13:43.042
I guess you could call the school.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.001
Dear Lord,

14:34.167 --> 14:37.126
Thank you for this meal that
you have placed in front of us

14:37.292 --> 14:38.459
on this night.

14:48.084 --> 14:49.959
You know I'm not babysitting
you tonight right, Freshman?

14:52.417 --> 14:55.042
Mr Gordon said you were
supposed to stay with me.

14:55.709 --> 14:59.959
Yeah but what's he gonna do, bust me
for not being in school over vacation?

15:00.126 --> 15:01.126
Mr Gordon said that...

15:01.292 --> 15:04.501
"Mr Gordon said...Mr Gordon said"

15:04.667 --> 15:06.334
What are you, a freaking recording?

15:07.792 --> 15:09.542
- Where are you going ?
- Me ?

15:11.042 --> 15:12.292
Nowhere

15:13.251 --> 15:17.126
And if the sisters say anything, just tell
them I wasn't feeling well so I'm staying in bed.

15:19.334 --> 15:21.084
You do know about the sisters, don't you?

15:21.751 --> 15:23.209
Know what ?

15:23.417 --> 15:25.292
You know they wear wigs, right?

15:27.959 --> 15:30.292
You know they have no hair on their bodies?

15:32.209 --> 15:33.751
No hair anywhere

15:36.959 --> 15:38.751
Next time, check their eyebrows.

15:39.834 --> 15:41.376
Totally fake.

15:42.751 --> 15:46.126
The real ones...burned right off.

15:46.459 --> 15:47.876
That's not true.

15:48.042 --> 15:51.001
You didn't hear about Jen Darling's sister?

15:51.167 --> 15:53.334
Graduated three years ago.

15:55.417 --> 15:57.459
She walked in on them one night...

15:59.167 --> 16:01.292
...worshipping the Devil.

16:07.042 --> 16:08.167
Who told you ?

16:18.917 --> 16:20.251
Don't come in my room, okay?

16:22.001 --> 16:24.084
And don't touch my shit.

19:31.751 --> 19:33.209
Th...uh, there's someone in here.

20:06.876 --> 20:10.626
<i>I'm sorry. The number you have dialled has
been disconnected or is no longer in service.</i>

21:14.126 --> 21:15.334
Are you okay ?

21:18.334 --> 21:19.542
You can't be warm enough in that jacket.

21:25.751 --> 21:27.042
Are you waiting for someone?

21:30.209 --> 21:31.459
Can we give you a lift somewhere?
You gotta be freezing.

21:34.334 --> 21:35.459
Where are you heading ?

21:36.792 --> 21:40.751
We're gonna get back on the highway and
then we're gonna head east a little while.

21:41.876 --> 21:43.542
How 'bout you, you heading someplace?

21:44.459 --> 21:49.167
- Portsmith.
- Sure, I know Portsmith.

21:51.084 --> 21:52.709
I'm parked right over there. My
wife's waiting in the car

21:52.917 --> 21:54.417
See? Right there.

21:59.209 --> 22:00.542
My name's Bill.

22:01.209 --> 22:02.167
What's your name?

22:03.667 --> 22:04.584
Joan.

22:05.584 --> 22:06.792
My name's Joan.

22:08.334 --> 22:10.834
Nice, nice name.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.667
Bill, what're you doing ?

22:16.834 --> 22:18.417
Just trying to help.

22:20.834 --> 22:21.751
C'mon.

22:40.417 --> 22:42.459
We'll take her to the next gas station.

22:44.626 --> 22:45.792
I'm trying to help.

23:41.584 --> 23:42.792
Call me later okay?

23:44.584 --> 23:45.959
I don't have my phone.

23:50.001 --> 23:51.126
So that's it?

23:52.917 --> 23:54.126
Stop saying that.

23:56.501 --> 23:58.459
What am I supposed to say?

24:00.584 --> 24:01.792
Nothing.

24:07.542 --> 24:08.542
I'll take care of it.

24:10.251 --> 24:11.876
Can you at least let me drive you there?

24:11.876 --> 24:12.042
No...no way
Can you at least let me drive you there?

24:12.042 --> 24:14.417
No...no way

24:18.167 --> 24:19.167
Careful, OK?

24:21.959 --> 24:25.667
Careful...
Yeah, right.

25:29.126 --> 25:30.334
Idiot!

27:45.834 --> 27:46.917
Katherine?

31:58.834 --> 31:59.751
It's Bill.

32:01.667 --> 32:03.417
From the bus station.

32:06.584 --> 32:07.709
Do you mind if I come in ?

32:28.417 --> 32:30.167
Just wanted to see how you're doing.

32:33.667 --> 32:34.959
I see you're up at least.

32:58.001 --> 32:59.084
So...

33:01.626 --> 33:03.459
I guess you're pretty zonked out there, huh?

33:05.584 --> 33:07.501
You slept for four hours in the backseat.

33:09.084 --> 33:10.126
I'm sorry.

33:10.334 --> 33:11.167
For what?

33:15.792 --> 33:16.626
First rule,

33:17.792 --> 33:19.709
you don't apologise to me, young lady.

33:21.376 --> 33:22.376
I'm happy to help, okay?

33:23.334 --> 33:24.542
I'm sorry...

33:26.084 --> 33:26.917
It's okay.

33:31.542 --> 33:32.709
Why are you doing this?

33:34.334 --> 33:35.251
Doing what ?

33:36.001 --> 33:37.542
Helping me so much?

33:42.792 --> 33:44.376
Do you believe in God, Joan?

33:49.209 --> 33:51.167
No? Just like that?

33:58.667 --> 34:00.334
Ever try to look for him?

34:04.792 --> 34:06.001
It's strange.

34:07.334 --> 34:11.917
People think you look for Him
in some book, or a church or

34:12.583 --> 34:14.333
a statue

34:14.708 --> 34:17.042
...maybe even a candle flame.

34:20.042 --> 34:21.792
But that's not how it works for me.

34:24.126 --> 34:27.042
I look for Him in the
unlikely things that happen.

34:28.208 --> 34:30.042
Little coïncidences.

34:31.958 --> 34:34.667
When I saw you sitting
at that bus station,

34:37.333 --> 34:39.251
You reminded me so much
of someone...

34:43.792 --> 34:45.917
someone I haven't seen
in a long time...

34:47.958 --> 34:50.667
And then, when you said you were going to Portsmith...

34:51.251 --> 34:55.501
Well...a coincidence like that
I just can't ignore it.

34:59.251 --> 35:01.959
So strange as it may sound,

35:04.042 --> 35:06.042
I guess I saw God in you.

35:13.501 --> 35:15.292
Are you going to Portsmith too?

35:16.251 --> 35:17.542
No, not exactly.

35:18.667 --> 35:20.959
Linda and I are headed
to the town just before it...

35:22.334 --> 35:23.501
We're going to Bramford.

35:28.209 --> 35:29.251
Do you know Bramford?

35:44.084 --> 35:45.084
What's that?

35:45.667 --> 35:47.376
When do we leave?

35:50.959 --> 35:52.084
What's your hurry?

35:57.417 --> 35:58.626
Where's your wife ?

36:02.209 --> 36:03.501
She's sleeping.

36:09.001 --> 36:09.876
Why?

36:18.626 --> 36:23.251
Well, hopefully we can...

36:23.417 --> 36:25.792
...get out of here first thing
in the morning.

36:25.959 --> 36:29.042
I, uh...bet you're pretty hungry.

36:30.542 --> 36:33.376
There's a restaurant next door.

36:33.542 --> 36:36.084
Why don't you get dressed,
come down and have some dinner.

37:11.751 --> 37:14.501
You know how much trouble
I could get into for this?

37:26.667 --> 37:27.959
Do you need a towel?

37:36.709 --> 37:38.167
So what were you doing down there?

37:47.876 --> 37:49.251
Were you sleepwalking?

37:51.042 --> 37:53.001
Do you sleepwalk, is that
what that was?

38:02.917 --> 38:04.126
What about your parents?

38:04.876 --> 38:06.084
Did they call?

38:24.001 --> 38:25.251
They're not going to call.

38:27.334 --> 38:28.709
They just got confused.

38:29.459 --> 38:30.292
Like your parents?

38:32.042 --> 38:34.001
But your parents didn't get confused.

38:35.292 --> 38:37.667
You told them not to come
so you could go out on a date.

38:41.084 --> 38:42.959
- It wasn't a date.
- It wasn't?

38:43.667 --> 38:46.126
- No, it wasn't.
- What was it?

38:47.042 --> 38:48.251
Nothing.

38:52.626 --> 38:54.792
Mr Gordon said you were
supposed to look after me.

39:03.792 --> 39:05.334
I know what Mr Gordon said.

39:05.584 --> 39:08.542
Mr Gordon said worst case they'd
be here by Friday.

39:08.876 --> 39:11.167
- Yeah, I know what he said...
- And now it's too late.

39:12.042 --> 39:13.084
Too late for what?

39:15.501 --> 39:16.542
They're dead.

39:29.751 --> 39:31.626
That is an awful thing to say.

39:34.084 --> 39:35.626
You shouldn't say things like that.

39:38.542 --> 39:42.876
You shouldn't say things like that,
okay? It's just not funny.

39:53.001 --> 39:54.167
You smell pretty...

39:59.209 --> 40:00.542
You should go to bed.

40:01.667 --> 40:03.376
Just go to bed, then when you wake up
in the morning...

40:06.126 --> 40:08.959
you're gonna be okay, alright?

40:09.917 --> 40:13.167
They'll be here on Friday.
They're already on their way.

40:13.334 --> 40:14.709
That's it. OK ?

40:16.126 --> 40:17.292
That's it.

40:21.292 --> 40:22.751
You should go to bed now.

40:24.459 --> 40:26.084
Is there anything else I can get you?

40:26.751 --> 40:30.584
No, you had your chance.

41:41.667 --> 41:42.542
There she is

41:43.376 --> 41:46.209
Linda has an extra coat.
It's a lot warmer than yours.

41:46.376 --> 41:47.876
She won't mind if you borrow it.

41:48.292 --> 41:49.584
She's gonna be along any minute.

41:52.376 --> 41:54.334
So...Portsmith, huh?

41:55.292 --> 41:56.459
Is that your home?

41:56.626 --> 41:58.251
Your mom and dad?

42:01.417 --> 42:04.251
No...friends? Someone?

42:06.459 --> 42:09.126
- Someone.
- That's better than having no one, isn't it?

42:11.501 --> 42:14.126
They changed the decor of
this place a few years ago.

42:15.501 --> 42:18.167
Used to be more of a kid's place,

42:18.334 --> 42:21.001
famous for their chicken noodle soup.

42:21.167 --> 42:23.459
That's how we came by it anyway.

42:23.626 --> 42:26.251
Linda and I used to, uh, spend a lot
of time here with our daughter.

42:30.167 --> 42:32.792
Remember I told you that you,
uh, remind me of somebody?

42:36.876 --> 42:39.876
You reminded me of her...my daughter.

42:41.917 --> 42:44.084
She'd be right about your age by now.

42:47.126 --> 42:48.834
We lost her nine years ago.

42:50.667 --> 42:51.501
Nine years, uh...

42:52.792 --> 42:54.501
tomorrow, actually.

42:56.417 --> 42:58.167
And it's okay, we do okay...

42:59.001 --> 43:00.751
It's difficult but uh...

43:01.751 --> 43:03.959
You know what they say,
time heals all wounds.

43:05.292 --> 43:07.751
And little by little it does
get easier, except...

43:07.917 --> 43:11.209
around this time of year when
we go and lay flowers...

43:11.376 --> 43:12.542
on the anniversary.

43:16.167 --> 43:17.542
I've got a picture.

43:48.459 --> 43:49.667
That's my Rose.

43:52.667 --> 43:53.917
She's pretty.

43:55.167 --> 43:56.876
Yes she is, isn't she?

44:01.917 --> 44:03.751
Have you decided?

44:03.792 --> 44:05.709
Oh, uh, yes I've decided.

44:06.501 --> 44:09.042
- Joan, you decided?
- Excuse me.

45:13.084 --> 45:14.959
Oh, there you are.

45:15.126 --> 45:18.501
Look, we've got some, uh, really
bad weather coming in overnight.

45:18.667 --> 45:22.126
And if we don't get on the road tonight,
we're gonna be snowed in tomorrow,

45:22.292 --> 45:24.126
maybe the day after.

45:25.084 --> 45:27.959
They're gonna pack up our food for us, so
why don't you grab it and meet me out front?

45:58.917 --> 46:00.892
What did he tell you?

46:06.084 --> 46:07.934
Did he tell you about our daughter?

46:16.084 --> 46:18.501
When he told you about
our daughter he said,

46:19.334 --> 46:22.084
HAVE, didn't he?

46:28.792 --> 46:30.251
"We HAVE a daughter."

46:39.167 --> 46:41.459
He told you, you remind
him of her.

46:46.667 --> 46:48.626
He actually said that to you,
didn't he?

46:53.626 --> 46:56.417
It's okay, poor thing...

46:56.876 --> 46:59.376
He tries to say that to everyone.

47:01.376 --> 47:03.084
Of course, I never see it.

47:04.334 --> 47:06.084
Of course it isn't true.

47:12.459 --> 47:16.001
But still sometimes I try.

47:19.334 --> 47:21.209
I saw it once,

47:23.667 --> 47:26.542
I was at the supermarket alone.

47:27.459 --> 47:32.126
And I was standing in the middle
of a long aisle all by myself.

47:35.376 --> 47:37.292
And a girl came 'round the corner.

47:39.917 --> 47:42.376
She was looking on a low shelf for something.

47:43.417 --> 47:44.959
She's about 15.

47:46.834 --> 47:51.584
And she had her money held
tightly in her hand

47:51.751 --> 47:53.417
like children do.

47:57.459 --> 47:59.667
I guess school had gone back already.

48:02.042 --> 48:03.876
- (Indecipherable) -

48:04.626 --> 48:08.709
She was just in her uniform, skirt...

48:08.876 --> 48:11.292
sneakers...with no socks.

48:12.126 --> 48:14.042
Her knees were pink,

48:15.751 --> 48:17.917
It was red from the cold.

48:18.667 --> 48:20.126
But what did she know?

48:24.417 --> 48:26.292
She had her hair in a ponytail

48:27.376 --> 48:30.792
and I could see the roots being
pulled back from her ears.

48:52.417 --> 48:54.042
You don't look anything like her.

48:59.959 --> 49:01.334
It's strange.

49:02.459 --> 49:04.334
I can't see you at all.

50:19.501 --> 50:20.917
Well what did they say?

50:27.626 --> 50:28.917
What did they say?

50:29.751 --> 50:30.959
He said it's all right.

50:31.292 --> 50:32.959
Wait, what's all right?
Who says?

50:33.834 --> 50:36.001
He says I can't live here,

50:37.167 --> 50:38.626
but I can...with him.

50:41.042 --> 50:41.792
Who's he?

50:43.792 --> 50:44.751
You know who.

50:45.876 --> 50:47.042
No, I don't know.

50:47.459 --> 50:49.126
Mr Gordon

50:49.292 --> 50:50.709
Silly...

50:51.459 --> 50:53.126
He's the headmaster.

51:07.459 --> 51:09.084
You smell pretty...

51:37.542 --> 51:38.376
Dear Lord...

51:39.084 --> 51:42.126
Thank you for this meal that you have
placed in front of us on this day.

51:43.501 --> 51:44.334
Katherine...

51:50.876 --> 51:51.667
Yes, ma'am?

51:53.501 --> 51:54.751
Is there something wrong?

51:56.542 --> 51:57.376
No, ma'am.

51:59.751 --> 52:01.334
In that case,

52:02.209 --> 52:05.376
kindly repeat Grace for
the rest of us.

52:15.417 --> 52:16.751
Dear Lord...

52:18.751 --> 52:23.584
Thank you for this meal that you've
place in front of us that...

52:25.959 --> 52:27.334
and for which we're truly...

52:27.501 --> 52:28.334
Katherine!

52:51.376 --> 52:52.501
Mercy!

52:57.959 --> 52:59.417
Is she okay?

53:06.126 --> 53:07.709
She's fine.

53:10.126 --> 53:11.542
Did Mr Gordon call?

53:12.667 --> 53:14.751
Why on earth would the
headmaster call here?

53:16.459 --> 53:17.834
I don't know...just...

53:18.001 --> 53:20.459
To see if they were all right?
Her parents?

53:20.834 --> 53:22.709
Of course they are all right.

53:23.792 --> 53:26.251
And Katherine is all right as well.

53:29.501 --> 53:31.042
Thank you, Miss Drake.

53:31.834 --> 53:32.876
Drink this, dear.

53:36.501 --> 53:37.584
Katherine...

53:40.542 --> 53:42.292
Get your hands off me, cunt.

53:55.209 --> 53:57.084
Miss Drake, the telephone please!

53:58.542 --> 53:59.876
Certainly, dear.

54:08.542 --> 54:10.917
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

54:12.084 --> 54:14.751
You will look at me when
I am talking to you!

54:15.834 --> 54:16.542
Miss Prescott?

54:17.126 --> 54:18.167
A word, please.

54:23.292 --> 54:25.167
He really did say he'd come.

54:28.334 --> 54:30.459
He'll come and he'll say he was wrong.

54:33.501 --> 54:35.667
This time he'll say that
I can live here.

54:36.709 --> 54:38.501
He's the headmaster...

54:39.709 --> 54:41.834
Rose, uh, come out here please.

54:58.876 --> 55:02.542
I'm kindly asking...to shovel
the path between the houses

55:03.876 --> 55:05.959
Shovel it down to the earth.

55:06.126 --> 55:08.376
Me?
Why me?

55:08.876 --> 55:10.251
What did I do?

55:10.417 --> 55:13.292
Mr Gordon will be arriving
this afternoon.

55:15.626 --> 55:17.126
Mr Gordon...

55:19.417 --> 55:20.834
What happened?

55:23.084 --> 55:26.667
Down to the earth...please.

58:11.709 --> 58:14.876
- You alright?
- Uh, yes.

58:15.209 --> 58:17.042
They should be over this way.

59:11.709 --> 59:13.126
Miss Prescott ?

01:01:05.376 --> 01:01:06.376
Mommy?

01:01:09.042 --> 01:01:10.292
Dad?

01:01:13.917 --> 01:01:15.792
<i>Hi, baby girl.</i>

01:01:21.667 --> 01:01:22.667
Dad?

01:01:24.459 --> 01:01:25.834
<i>Katherine...</i>

01:01:30.917 --> 01:01:32.751
Wh-Who is it?

01:01:42.459 --> 01:01:44.626
<i>They're not coming.</i>

01:01:46.917 --> 01:01:49.917
<i>Kill all the cunts.</i>

01:03:24.042 --> 01:03:25.917
<i>...they're wigs, right?</i>

01:03:28.167 --> 01:03:30.917
<i>You know that they have no hair
on their bodies?</i>

01:03:32.459 --> 01:03:34.376
<i>No hair anywhere?</i>

01:03:36.084 --> 01:03:38.376
<i>Next time check their eyebrows.</i>

01:03:39.084 --> 01:03:40.501
<i>Totally fake.</i>

01:03:41.709 --> 01:03:45.626
<i>The real ones...burned right off.</i>

01:03:46.959 --> 01:03:49.584
<i>You didn't hear about
Jen Darling's sister?</i>

01:03:50.167 --> 01:03:52.251
<i>Graduated three years ago.</i>

01:03:54.334 --> 01:03:56.376
<i>She walked in on them one night...</i>

01:04:00.001 --> 01:04:01.917
<i>worshipping the Devil.</i>

01:05:13.167 --> 01:05:16.542
<i>You can stay here with me...</i>

01:05:23.334 --> 01:05:25.292
<i>long time...</i>

01:05:32.501 --> 01:05:34.417
<i> (Indecipherable) </i>

01:08:31.834 --> 01:08:35.042
Oh my god...oh my god.

01:08:51.501 --> 01:08:52.584
Katherine ?

01:14:22.517 --> 01:14:23.551
Oh Jesus...

01:14:32.042 --> 01:14:32.876
Hey, drop it!

01:14:44.417 --> 01:14:46.667
Hey drop...drop it...

01:14:58.876 --> 01:15:01.626
Drop it!
Drop the knife!

01:15:05.667 --> 01:15:08.526
Drop the knife, goddammit! This is your
last warning! I will shoot you!

01:15:16.792 --> 01:15:18.126
DROP THE KNIFE!!

01:15:27.917 --> 01:15:29.376
I have Satan...

01:15:32.542 --> 01:15:33.667
I have Satan...

01:15:33.834 --> 01:15:35.417
I SAID DROP THE KNIFE!

01:16:21.376 --> 01:16:23.209
Did you tell her?

01:16:24.292 --> 01:16:25.751
Did you tell her all about it?

01:16:26.251 --> 01:16:27.334
I told her.

01:16:30.459 --> 01:16:33.542
When you meet these people,
do you say to them...

01:16:34.584 --> 01:16:35.959
do you say that she was murdered?

01:16:36.126 --> 01:16:37.376
Please!

01:16:37.542 --> 01:16:39.167
No, you don't.

01:16:39.417 --> 01:16:40.834
You don't say

01:16:41.251 --> 01:16:42.292
that when she was found,

01:16:42.459 --> 01:16:43.917
they had to do a blood test

01:16:44.084 --> 01:16:45.584
to see if her head matched the body.

01:16:45.834 --> 01:16:46.417
That's enough!

01:16:46.584 --> 01:16:48.834
Just focus on the road!

01:16:49.001 --> 01:16:51.084
Don't touch me!

01:17:19.792 --> 01:17:21.042
Can you please pull over?

01:17:22.059 --> 01:17:23.334
Huh? What was that?

01:17:24.501 --> 01:17:25.626
I think I'm gonna be sick.

01:17:26.167 --> 01:17:27.292
Are you alright back there?

01:17:27.751 --> 01:17:28.667
Please, pull over.

01:17:29.109 --> 01:17:32.917
Alright, hold on. Hold on.

01:17:33.042 --> 01:17:35.934
Bill, please. Just go past it.
We're not stopping.

01:17:36.076 --> 01:17:37.542
Hold on, hold on.

01:17:37.751 --> 01:17:39.292
Goddammit Bill, don't stop here!

01:17:39.534 --> 01:17:42.167
Okay...here we go.

01:21:46.792 --> 01:21:48.251
Katherine?

01:22:09.167 --> 01:22:10.376
There you are.

01:22:17.292 --> 01:22:19.126
You are not wanted here.

01:22:23.709 --> 01:22:26.751
I say, you will go from this place.

01:22:29.334 --> 01:22:30.834
You will leave here.

01:22:38.417 --> 01:22:40.876
<i>You will leave this poor girl...</i>

01:22:42.084 --> 01:22:44.542
<i>and you will never come back</i>

01:24:11.709 --> 01:24:13.376
I command that you leave this place.

01:24:16.667 --> 01:24:18.709
I command that you go out!

01:24:20.167 --> 01:24:22.209
I command that you go out!

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:26.334
By the power of Christ!

01:24:26.751 --> 01:24:27.501
I command you!

01:24:28.584 --> 01:24:31.042
I command you to leave this girl!

01:24:31.626 --> 01:24:33.626
And never come back!

01:24:36.667 --> 01:24:38.167
I command you to go out!

01:24:55.251 --> 01:24:56.459
Don't go.
