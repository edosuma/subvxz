Fall's right around the corner,

00:04.804 --> 00:07.974
{\an8}and we're all trying to get it
together before it's too late.

00:08.041 --> 00:09.743
{\an8}Would you wanna
go out sometime?

00:09.809 --> 00:12.112
{\an8}(Juliette)
Jared's been obsessed
with Madisson for years.

00:12.178 --> 00:13.413
{\an8}But so is Brandon.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.248
Madisson, you know
that cheating on you

00:15.315 --> 00:16.816
is like my biggest mistake.

00:16.883 --> 00:18.385
(Juliette)
Someone better make a move

00:18.451 --> 00:21.354

to start from scratch

{\an8}when his grandmother
cut him off.

00:24.891 --> 00:27.460
I don't feel
I can trust you anymore.

00:27.527 --> 00:29.929
{\an1}I think you should be put out
of the trust fund.

00:29.996 --> 00:31.564

Now he's gotta support himself

00:31.631 --> 00:33.566

in his life.

00:33.633 --> 00:37.237

getting started, too.

00:37.303 --> 00:39.239
{\an8}I finally broke up with Alex.

00:39.305 --> 00:42.675
{\an1}I don't wanna lose you,
but I can't date you.

00:42.742 --> 00:44.344
It's killing me,
but I'm determined

00:44.411 --> 00:46.746

this time...

00:46.813 --> 00:49.048
{\an1}Maybe y'all do need a break.
Maybe you really do.

...and trying not to wonder what
he's up to now that he's single.

you're a good person.

And I think what also

05:05.171 --> 05:07.473
is just driving me
so insane

05:07.540 --> 05:10.677
is that he says
nothing happened.

if you don't own up to this.

05:16.949 --> 05:19.986

to it is because Alex can never

05:20.053 --> 05:23.656

07:48.301 --> 07:50.303

16:22.548 --> 16:23.849
It happened right before
I went on tour.

16:23.916 --> 16:25.451
But I guess it's for
the better, you know?

16:25.517 --> 16:27.486
So I can really focus
and put everything

16:27.553 --> 16:29.488
{\an1}into like, my music career,
'cause that's where

16:29.555 --> 16:31.323
it matters most to me
right now, you know?

16:31.390 --> 16:33.625
{\an1}Just keep on doing, just keep
on making those contacts.

16:33.692 --> 16:35.494
Keep on meeting those people,
and that's what will happen.

16:35.561 --> 16:37.429
Doors will open.

16:35.561 --> 16:37.429
So, at like,

16:37.496 --> 16:39.298
at one of my shows recently,

16:39.365 --> 16:42.368
Madisson, Juliette,
and Chloe came out.

16:42.434 --> 16:44.670
{\an5}Madisson's nice.

16:42.434 --> 16:44.670
Nice, sweet girl.

16:44.737 --> 16:49.675
{\an1}She actually is going through,
you know, sort of like a...

16:49.742 --> 16:51.877
a breakup right now
with Ben, I guess.

16:51.944 --> 16:53.679
{\an4}Huh.

16:51.944 --> 16:53.679
So she's single right now.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.647
And she just showed up
at your concert, huh?

16:55.714 --> 16:57.349
She just showed up.
She showed up to support.

16:57.416 --> 16:59.351
{\an4}Well...

16:57.416 --> 16:59.351
{\an1}Showed up.
Showed some love, you know?

16:59.418 --> 17:02.621
Did you get a sense that there
was any-- any feelings there?

17:04.790 --> 17:07.025
{\an1}(laughing)

17:07.092 --> 17:09.294
{\an1}Well, really,
how was it like, seeing her?

17:09.361 --> 17:10.896
{\an1}Was there any sparks
flying there?

17:10.963 --> 17:13.565
{\an5}Was there anything?

17:10.963 --> 17:13.565
I still got feelings
for the girl and...

17:13.632 --> 17:15.434
{\an4}Aww...

17:13.632 --> 17:15.434
...telling me,
you know,

17:15.501 --> 17:17.435
{\an1}how like just seeing her there,
you know, brought back

17:17.502 --> 17:19.070
the good times we used
to have and, you know,

17:19.137 --> 17:22.207
{\an1}just made me sort of think about
what we used to share and...

17:22.273 --> 17:24.710
{\an8}♪♪

17:26.779 --> 17:29.415
{\an7}(Madisson)
I feel really good about us.

17:29.481 --> 17:31.683
{\an8}(Brandon)
I've never felt like,
this way before.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.218
{\an8}I'm not sure how
I really describe it.

17:33.285 --> 17:35.854
{\an8}It's a special feeling.

17:35.921 --> 17:37.790
{\an8}♪♪

17:40.392 --> 17:42.094
But I'm not sure exactly
where she stands,

17:42.161 --> 17:44.930
especially after what I've
done to her and, you know,

17:44.997 --> 17:46.365
what she thinks of me now.

17:46.432 --> 17:48.400
{\an1}You know what,
at the end of the day,

17:48.467 --> 17:50.702
I don't think you know where
that may or may not be going,

17:50.769 --> 17:53.138
{\an1}but it may be a conversation
that you need to have with her.

17:53.205 --> 17:54.973
She's a real special lady.

17:55.040 --> 17:58.110
{\an6}Exactly.

17:55.040 --> 17:58.110
{\an1}Something goes from there,
follow your heart.

17:58.177 --> 18:00.179
We'll see what happens.

17:58.177 --> 18:00.179

Feels like Santa Claus's

18:48.861 --> 18:50.162
{\an1}It is. It's normally
not this messy.

18:50.229 --> 18:52.431
Except it's hot
as a volcano.

18:52.498 --> 18:55.100
{\an1}Yeah? And I--
that's what we work in.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.536
{\an1}This business is not
for the weary.

18:57.603 --> 19:01.073
Well, the reason
I'm here is...

19:01.139 --> 19:02.641
to ask for a job.

19:02.708 --> 19:07.112
You know, we are family
and I'd-- I'd hate to go

19:07.179 --> 19:08.814
filling out job applications,

19:08.881 --> 19:11.216
that is the worst.

19:11.283 --> 19:12.518
Yeah...

19:14.319 --> 19:17.890
Um... Alex did tell me that

19:17.956 --> 19:19.691
you're out looking for work.

19:19.758 --> 19:22.494
{\an1}And you know,
you're family and I love you.

19:22.561 --> 19:25.464
But I do require applications.

19:28.233 --> 19:33.071
{\an1}I am hiring,
but with that being said,

19:33.138 --> 19:34.873
{\an1}you know,
there are rules.

19:38.577 --> 19:40.879
Uh, how many breaks
do we get?

19:40.946 --> 19:42.748
{\an1}Um...

19:44.650 --> 19:46.318
{\an1}It just depends.
And you gotta have

19:46.385 --> 19:48.320
{\an1}a flexible schedule
to work here.

19:48.387 --> 19:50.489
{\an5}That's number one.

19:48.387 --> 19:50.489
Flexibility's not a problem,

19:50.556 --> 19:51.823
just as long as
you don't mind me

19:51.890 --> 19:54.493
{\an5}taking a smoke break
here and there.

19:51.890 --> 19:54.493
{\an1}You...

19:54.560 --> 19:56.028
And I'm not talking
about cigarettes.

19:56.094 --> 19:57.362
{\an3}(laughing)

19:56.094 --> 19:57.362
{\an1}Uh...

19:57.429 --> 20:00.399
{\an1}It's called So Staged,
not So Stoned.

20:00.465 --> 20:03.635
{\an6}(laughing)

20:00.465 --> 20:03.635
{\an1}So, no, I don't
tolerate that here

20:03.702 --> 20:06.238
{\an1}and I don't tolerate drinking
because we have machinery.

20:06.305 --> 20:09.441
You can get hurt. Are you good
with power tools or anything?

20:09.508 --> 20:11.143
{\an3}Um, yeah.

20:11.209 --> 20:12.711
You can use...?

20:11.209 --> 20:12.711
Oh, yeah.

20:14.379 --> 20:15.981
{\an1}Um...

20:16.048 --> 20:18.016
{\an1}I would need a real
commitment out of you

20:18.083 --> 20:19.918
that you're serious about it.

20:19.985 --> 20:22.788
I-- I know I'm not
the easiest to deal with.

20:22.854 --> 20:24.790
I can, you know...
but I'm gonna really

20:24.856 --> 20:27.793
give my all
and I'll try my best.

20:27.859 --> 20:28.894
{\an1}Um...

20:30.829 --> 20:33.165
{\an1}This whole getting-a-job thing
hasn't been easy on me.

20:33.231 --> 20:34.566
{\an5}No, I know.

20:33.231 --> 20:34.566
It's something

20:34.633 --> 20:37.102
that I was basically
forced to do.

20:37.169 --> 20:40.138
I still wanna
pursue my music.

20:40.205 --> 20:42.274
But... I need something

20:42.341 --> 20:46.378
{\an1}that's gonna cover my expenses
until I top the charts.

20:47.713 --> 20:49.314
{\an1}Hmm.

20:47.713 --> 20:49.314
I just need a job

20:49.381 --> 20:51.850
{\an1}until my grandmother gives
my car back and my trust fund,

20:51.917 --> 20:54.553
which hopefully
won't be too long.

20:54.620 --> 20:57.356
{\an1}Well, if I count on you,
I'm counting on you.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.658
{\an1}And that's--
that's something that

20:59.725 --> 21:01.460
{\an1}I really need you
to think about.

21:01.526 --> 21:04.830
{\an1}It's time to,
you know, grow up.

{\an1}Yeah, I mean, I've been hanging
out with Madisson a lot more.

21:35.193 --> 21:36.828
You know, just like
as friends and everything.

21:36.895 --> 21:39.965
So it's been going good,
and I've heard that

21:40.032 --> 21:41.800
she's single now,
good for me on that one.

21:41.867 --> 21:44.036
{\an5}Madisson's single, eh?

21:41.867 --> 21:44.036
'Cause I was thinking

21:44.102 --> 21:46.672
doing something to kind
of show her that I, like,

21:46.738 --> 21:48.206
I wanna be more than friends.

21:48.273 --> 21:49.708
{\an1}Uh-oh.
I didn't know that.

21:49.775 --> 21:52.644
Yeah, her and Ben
finally, uh, ended it.

21:52.711 --> 21:54.746
(bleep). Yeah.

21:52.711 --> 21:54.746
So that's good.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.448
{\an1}And, uh, I would say
there's definitely potential

21:56.515 --> 21:58.350
'cause we just
get along so well,

21:58.417 --> 22:00.285
so hoping for the best.

21:58.417 --> 22:00.285
{\an1}Yeah.

22:00.352 --> 22:01.353
{\an1}Uh-oh.

22:01.420 --> 22:02.621

Hopefully it goes
better than that.

What's been going on
with you? Anything new?

22:06.391 --> 22:09.361
{\an1}Um, so I got a huge
job opportunity, like,

22:09.428 --> 22:11.530
{\an1}in front of me right now,
to go travel

22:11.596 --> 22:13.065
{\an1}and be like a full-time
personal trainer.

22:13.131 --> 22:14.933
{\an5}Really?
That's awesome.

22:13.131 --> 22:14.933
{\an1}Yeah.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.768
{\an1}Yeah, it's in the works
right now and it's--

22:16.835 --> 22:19.471
{\an1}I mean, it's an amazing
opportunity, like, great money.

22:19.538 --> 22:20.939
{\an1}But then the whole
Cara thing right now

22:21.006 --> 22:22.908
{\an1}is just making it
so much more difficult.

22:22.974 --> 22:24.576
What's going on
with all that?

22:24.643 --> 22:28.447
{\an1}I got a text from Juliette
saying that she knows

22:28.513 --> 22:30.716
{\an1}that Cara went over
to Alex's house.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.252
{\an8}What's up?

22:34.319 --> 22:35.554
{\an8}Hi.

22:37.889 --> 22:40.459
{\an1}Like I haven't even,
you know, texted her back.

22:40.525 --> 22:41.626
Haven't responded to her.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.128
Like, I'm just
so pissed off.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.564
{\an1}Like, I don't feel like
dealing with Cara right now.

22:45.630 --> 22:46.898
{\an6}Yeah.

22:45.630 --> 22:46.898
{\an1}You know,
it just shows me

22:46.965 --> 22:49.234
that Alex is obviously
still in the picture.

22:49.301 --> 22:50.602
{\an1}I don't even know
why any girl

22:50.669 --> 22:52.471
{\an1}would wanna be wrapped up
in him, anyways.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.005
{\an1}It just sounds like
a terrible time, honestly.

22:54.072 --> 22:55.507
It's like, "Man...

22:55.574 --> 22:57.309
no one's treated me
like (bleep) this week."

22:57.375 --> 23:00.412
{\an5}Let me go to Alex's house.

22:57.375 --> 23:00.412
Better go over
to Alex's house.

23:00.479 --> 23:03.782
{\an1}Yeah. I'm just super frustrated
about the whole situation.

23:03.849 --> 23:05.150
I think, out of,
like, respect,

23:05.217 --> 23:06.985
she should have
told you herself.

23:07.052 --> 23:09.154
It's just more sketchy
to hear about it from Juliette.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.456
{\an1}I just know I'm gonna
have to talk to Cara and...

23:11.523 --> 23:13.658
{\an6}Yeah.

23:11.523 --> 23:13.658
...you know, figure out
what the hell went on.

23:13.725 --> 23:14.793
Yeah, you gotta be able
to trust her.

23:14.860 --> 23:16.394
{\an1}I've already dealt
a little bit

23:16.461 --> 23:19.264
{\an1}with being long distance
and just so much stress that...

23:19.331 --> 23:21.099
{\an6}Yeah.

23:19.331 --> 23:21.099
{\an1}...if you guys aren't
on the same page,

23:21.166 --> 23:23.101
{\an4}it's not gonna really work,
you know?

23:21.166 --> 23:23.101
Yeah, I feel you.

23:23.168 --> 23:25.771
I mean, how does Cara feel about
you possibly being on the road?

23:25.837 --> 23:27.739
{\an1}I haven't-- I haven't
talked to her yet.

23:27.806 --> 23:30.108
Give her the silent treatment.

23:30.175 --> 23:31.643

23:30.175 --> 23:31.643

24:45.617 --> 24:47.519
I'm just scared.

24:47.586 --> 24:49.421
{\an1}I mean, I don't wanna
fight with you over this,

24:49.487 --> 24:52.424
{\an1}but, like, quite honestly,
my opinion on it

24:52.490 --> 24:54.793
{\an1}is you (bleep) up
really, really bad,

24:54.860 --> 24:56.628
{\an1}and you shouldn't have
done it in the first place.

24:56.695 --> 25:00.398
{\an1}I'm sorry that me telling
Juliette made it worse for you,

25:00.465 --> 25:02.234
{\an1}but I don't wanna lie
to my friend, Cara.

25:02.300 --> 25:07.572
{\an1}Alex calling you over is such
a slap in Juliette's face.

25:07.639 --> 25:09.441
I know, and, like,
I know I (bleep) up,

25:09.507 --> 25:11.977
and I still haven't had a chance
to say anything to Garrett yet,

25:12.043 --> 25:13.278
because he's not
answering me.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.413
Like, he won't answer
any of my texts.

25:17.515 --> 25:19.985
{\an1}Well, I'm obviously
really sorry about that.

25:20.051 --> 25:23.355
{\an1}When Juliette texted you,
she texted Garrett

25:23.421 --> 25:25.290
about you going over to Alex's.

25:27.893 --> 25:30.662
{\an1}So that's why he hasn't been
answering me for days?

25:32.464 --> 25:34.566
Come on, Chloe, like,
you know how she is.

25:34.633 --> 25:37.435
{\an1}She's spiteful, and especially
when she gets pissed off,

25:37.502 --> 25:38.937
like she gets on
her phone right away.

25:39.004 --> 25:41.773
Like, "Let me screw over
everybody I can think of."

25:41.840 --> 25:44.776
I'm just like, obviously
really pissed about it,

25:44.843 --> 25:47.012
{\an1}'cause I haven't even
had a chance to talk to him,

25:47.078 --> 25:48.313
and I didn't get a chance

25:48.380 --> 25:50.181
to tell him firsthand
what happened.

25:50.248 --> 25:52.651
{\an1}Like, he's hearing something
through Juliette.

25:52.717 --> 25:55.387
Yeah, that's (bleep) up.
And is there a part of me

25:55.453 --> 25:57.989
that ever thought Juliette
would text you or Garrett?

25:58.056 --> 25:59.391
No, I thought, if anything,

25:59.457 --> 26:02.060
{\an4}she would freak out
on Alex somewhat.

25:59.457 --> 26:02.060
{\an3}Right.

26:02.127 --> 26:05.697
And I'm super sorry that it's
come back on you and Garrett,

26:05.764 --> 26:06.932
but at the end of the day,

26:06.998 --> 26:08.867
{\an1}you shouldn't have
gone over to Alex's.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.374
If he, God forbid,
tries to break up with me,

26:16.441 --> 26:19.844
like, I have no idea
what I'll do.

26:22.147 --> 26:24.316
{\an1}So what are you gonna do
about Juliette?

26:24.382 --> 26:27.452
{\an5}I don't know,
I'm so nervous
to talk to her.

26:27.519 --> 26:30.956
She is like crazy, and like,
I like, didn't go over there

26:31.022 --> 26:33.625
with bad intentions, but,
like, I know she's upset.

26:33.692 --> 26:35.293
Juliette is malicious.

26:36.795 --> 26:38.863
I, like, don't even
wanna think about it.

26:41.666 --> 26:44.202
{\an7}Why do you think it's a good
idea to go over to Alex's?

26:44.269 --> 26:46.371
I wasn't really concerned

26:46.438 --> 26:48.406
what you were going
to think about it.

26:48.473 --> 26:49.774
You've never been nice to me.

26:49.841 --> 26:51.209
We're not friends, like...

27:06.758 --> 27:08.526
{\an4}Yeah.

27:06.758 --> 27:08.526
Yeah? You just walk here
or something?

27:08.593 --> 27:09.861
{\an5}Good to see you.

27:08.593 --> 27:09.861
Yeah, you too.

27:09.928 --> 27:11.763
{\an1}Almost had a heat stroke
on the way over here.

27:11.830 --> 27:13.765
Oh, man, you better
get ready then.

27:13.832 --> 27:15.700
Talked a lot of (bleep)
back in the past,

27:15.767 --> 27:17.702
but you're here now.

27:15.767 --> 27:17.702
{\an1}I know.

27:17.769 --> 27:18.937
{\an1}Well, I had
to make a change,

27:19.004 --> 27:20.772
and you seem to be
on the right path.

27:20.839 --> 27:23.341
And I can't say that
I wanted to be here.

27:23.408 --> 27:24.509
This was a last resort.

27:24.576 --> 27:25.977
{\an3}Okay.

27:26.044 --> 27:28.880
To be honest, my grandmother
and me aren't getting along,

27:28.947 --> 27:32.417
{\an1}so she's told me that
she wasn't taking it anymore.

27:32.484 --> 27:36.254
{\an1}And what she was taking
was my cars, bank account.

27:36.321 --> 27:38.490
It's all gone.

27:36.321 --> 27:38.490
{\an3}Damn.

27:38.556 --> 27:39.824
So I just wanted to show her

27:39.891 --> 27:41.092
{\an1}that I'm trying
to start a new path.

27:41.159 --> 27:42.827
{\an1}The path to getting
my car back.

27:42.894 --> 27:44.796
{\an5}(laughing)
All right, man.

27:42.894 --> 27:44.796
What do we got here?

27:44.863 --> 27:46.064
So I got a whole routine
set up.

27:46.131 --> 27:48.533
We got the ladder,
we got some cones.

27:48.600 --> 27:49.701
Let's do it.
What are we doing first?

27:49.768 --> 27:50.902
So we'll start out
with the ladder.

27:50.969 --> 27:52.337
High knees, high knees,
high knees.

27:52.404 --> 27:54.272
{\an5}It's kind of
like hopscotch.

27:52.404 --> 27:54.272
A little bit.

27:54.339 --> 27:55.607
{\an1}Go.

27:55.673 --> 27:56.775
{\an1}There you go.
Get those knees up.

27:56.841 --> 27:57.976
{\an5}Hold on.

27:56.841 --> 27:57.976
It's all good.

27:58.043 --> 27:59.677
There you go.
Same thing.

27:59.744 --> 28:01.379
Two feet.
Dropping those arms.

28:01.446 --> 28:02.981
Driving those knees up.

28:03.048 --> 28:05.850
{\an1}All right, make sure you go
full-- full speed then.

28:05.917 --> 28:08.386
I need my "Rocky" music
right now.

28:08.453 --> 28:10.555
Driving those arms,
driving those arms.

28:10.622 --> 28:12.090
{\an5}How you feeling?

28:10.622 --> 28:12.090
Feeling it.

28:12.157 --> 28:13.792
{\an1}Yeah, you better
get some, uh,

28:13.858 --> 28:16.194
{\an1}pictures of me doing this
for my grandmother.

28:16.261 --> 28:18.296
{\an1}Get those knees up.
There you go.

28:19.898 --> 28:21.499
This is gonna get harder.
Hit it.

28:21.566 --> 28:23.301
Come on. Get down.

28:23.368 --> 28:24.669
{\an5}Drive through,
drive through,
drive through.

28:24.736 --> 28:26.337
{\an5}Oof!

28:24.736 --> 28:26.337
{\an3}Oh, man.

28:26.404 --> 28:27.505
(camera clicking)

28:27.572 --> 28:29.307
I gotta stop smoking.

28:29.374 --> 28:32.043
So you got a lot of weight
holding you down right now.

28:32.110 --> 28:35.280
Well, I'm about to put
some more on you.

28:35.346 --> 28:38.149
You're loving this,
aren't you, Garrett?

28:38.216 --> 28:39.717
Oh, my God.

28:39.784 --> 28:40.819
Side shuffling.

28:40.885 --> 28:42.353
For the car, for the car.

28:42.420 --> 28:43.955
For the car,
exactly.

28:44.022 --> 28:45.290
{\an5}For the car, for the--

28:44.022 --> 28:45.290

28:45.356 --> 28:48.259
{\an5}For the car!

28:45.356 --> 28:48.259
Think about it.
Jog out.

28:48.326 --> 28:50.295
I'm getting dizzy.

28:50.361 --> 28:51.529
Not so easy, huh?

28:51.596 --> 28:52.997
(sighs heavily)

28:54.432 --> 28:55.867
{\an3}Done.

28:55.934 --> 28:57.602

29:16.387 --> 29:18.256
Hi.

Hi.

{\an3}What's up?

29:20.825 --> 29:22.760
{\an1}(sighs)

29:22.827 --> 29:25.563
{\an1}I'm a little pissed off,
honestly.

29:25.630 --> 29:29.434
{\an1}Why did you think it's a good
idea to go over to Alex's?

29:29.501 --> 29:30.869
And, yeah, we're broken up,

29:30.935 --> 29:33.805
{\an1}but you had to have known
that this would piss me off.

29:36.174 --> 29:39.277
{\an1}No offense, Juliette, like,
I wasn't really concerned

29:39.344 --> 29:41.112
what you were going
to think about it.

29:41.179 --> 29:43.214
{\an1}(sighs)

29:43.281 --> 29:45.216
I don't owe you anything,
and I know you know that.

29:45.283 --> 29:47.919
{\an1}You've never been nice to me.
We're not friends, like...

29:47.986 --> 29:49.554
You don't have to like me.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.990
{\an1}You just have to have a little
more respect than you do.

29:52.056 --> 29:54.325
I feel like you almost knew
that I was gonna find out.

29:54.392 --> 29:56.227
It wasn't intentional
for you to find out.

29:56.294 --> 29:57.862
{\an1}This wasn't, like, about you,
Juliette, it wasn't.

29:57.929 --> 29:59.364
So what did you talk about?
What were your intentions?

29:59.430 --> 30:01.799
{\an1}We talked about your breakup
and how he's (bleep) sad.

30:01.866 --> 30:03.168
Like, we literally
sat there and talked

30:03.234 --> 30:05.069
for 20 minutes,
and I left.

30:05.136 --> 30:07.205
It's not like I went there
to go hook up with him.

30:08.907 --> 30:10.775
{\an1}You know I texted
Garrett, right?

30:10.842 --> 30:12.277
I know you did.

30:10.842 --> 30:12.277
{\an1}Yeah.

30:12.343 --> 30:14.145
{\an1}Did you think that was like,
so necessary for you

30:14.212 --> 30:16.214
{\an5}to have to tell him that?

30:14.212 --> 30:16.214
Kind of! Kind of.

30:16.281 --> 30:17.549
Like, what if this is,
like, really gonna

30:17.615 --> 30:19.150
{\an1}change something now because
you had to text him?

30:19.217 --> 30:21.486
Then maybe you should
have told him before.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.488
I was just figuring out
how I needed to put it.

30:23.555 --> 30:26.191
{\an1}You should have never
went over to Alex's house.

30:26.257 --> 30:28.393
How would that
make you feel?

30:28.459 --> 30:30.728
I mean, I'm Garrett's ex.

30:30.795 --> 30:33.431
{\an1}Have I asked Garrett
to hang out?

30:35.600 --> 30:39.571
If you and Garrett break up,
I won't go and talk to him.

30:39.637 --> 30:41.072
Yeah, but, like, if I--

30:41.139 --> 30:43.708
{\an1}Like, there are other people
for Alex to talk to.

30:43.775 --> 30:45.710
{\an1}And I know that
he asked you,

30:45.777 --> 30:48.513
but you should have said no.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.648
I was just trying
to be there for someone

30:50.715 --> 30:52.016
that I used to be close with.

30:52.083 --> 30:54.018
When Alex and I were,
like, good friends,

30:54.085 --> 30:55.853
like, we used to talk
about, like, the person

30:55.920 --> 30:58.089
that each other
was with all the time.

30:58.156 --> 30:59.924
{\an5}I mean, most of
the conversation
was just asking

30:59.991 --> 31:01.960
about advice on how
to get you back.

31:02.026 --> 31:04.596
{\an1}Sounds like he just
wanted you over.

31:06.130 --> 31:07.765
{\an1}'Cause if he really
wanted to get me back,

31:07.832 --> 31:09.267
which won't happen,

31:09.334 --> 31:12.103
he wouldn't have
invited you over.

31:12.170 --> 31:13.538
Alex is calculated.

31:13.605 --> 31:16.407
He has an agenda
and he's manipulative.

31:16.474 --> 31:18.576
{\an1}I don't know if he wanted this
to get back to you or not,

31:18.643 --> 31:22.880
{\an1}but I am sorry that I went,
and I regret going,

31:22.947 --> 31:24.916
especially when it comes
to someone like Alex.

31:24.983 --> 31:26.417
We all know how he is.

31:26.484 --> 31:28.586
{\an1}Like, he's gonna lie
for his benefit all the time.

31:28.653 --> 31:30.588
And I'm embarrassed
that I supported him,

31:30.655 --> 31:32.924
because if I had to choose
a side, it would be yours.

31:34.559 --> 31:38.096
I am really sorry.

31:38.162 --> 31:39.464
Just because I know that

31:39.530 --> 31:41.799
he's lied to you
in the past and all that.

31:41.866 --> 31:44.135
{\an1}Yeah.

31:44.202 --> 31:46.804
I'm sorry I texted Garrett.

31:46.871 --> 31:49.140
{\an1}I-- It was kind of like,
an impulse move.

31:49.207 --> 31:50.975
Yeah, it's just--
I'm gonna have

31:51.042 --> 31:52.610
have to figure
that one out, but...

31:52.677 --> 31:54.779
{\an1}It's fine. If you guys
really didn't do anything,

31:54.846 --> 31:56.281
he shouldn't be that mad.

31:56.347 --> 31:58.549
Yeah, I just hope
to explain to him.

31:58.616 --> 32:01.819
I won't text your boyfriend
what you're doing anymore,

32:01.886 --> 32:04.322
{\an1}if you don't go over
to my ex's house.

32:04.389 --> 32:07.558
{\an1}I will not go over to your
ex's house from here on out.

32:07.625 --> 32:09.193
{\an1}And...

32:07.625 --> 32:09.193
That's for sure.

32:09.260 --> 32:10.561
{\an1}...if we just like agree
to respect each other,

32:10.628 --> 32:11.896
we'll be fine.

32:10.628 --> 32:11.896
Yeah, I'm...

32:11.963 --> 32:14.299
{\an4}Girl code.

32:11.963 --> 32:14.299
I'm willing
to make a truce.

32:14.365 --> 32:16.968
I just think Alex is like,
not good for either of us,

32:17.035 --> 32:18.336
or, really, anyone.

32:18.403 --> 32:19.837
And I'm sorry
to say that to you,

32:19.904 --> 32:22.173
but he's not a great guy.

32:22.240 --> 32:23.875
{\an1}(sighs)
It's fine.

32:23.941 --> 32:25.977
{\an1}I'm hoping one day
he'll learn.

32:26.044 --> 32:28.780
Not soon, though.

32:28.846 --> 32:30.248
{\an1}Yeah.

32:33.051 --> 32:35.520
{\an8}Every time that Alex
needs your attention,

32:35.586 --> 32:36.988
{\an8}you're there for him.

32:37.055 --> 32:38.489
{\an1}I honestly do not
wanna deal with a girl

32:38.556 --> 32:40.692
{\an1}that's involved with Alex
anymore, so I'm sorry.

In my experience,

33:00.078 --> 33:02.013
when exes hang out,
it's usually 'cause

33:02.080 --> 33:03.981
at least one of them wants
to get back together.

33:04.048 --> 33:06.751

Brandon's been single

33:08.786 --> 33:11.622
{\an7}I don't have time
for a relationship.

33:11.689 --> 33:13.424

first of all, that you came out.

33:34.712 --> 33:36.381
No, of course,
I wanted to be there.

33:36.447 --> 33:37.515

{\an8}I feel good, but...
I don't know

33:45.823 --> 33:50.027
{\an7}if you've heard or not,
but I did break up with Ben.

33:50.094 --> 33:51.295
{\an1}Yeah.

33:51.362 --> 33:53.765
{\an1}Which is, it's for the best,
it really is, so...

33:53.831 --> 33:56.968
{\an1}Think I got scared once
he said he was moving here,

33:57.034 --> 33:59.670
{\an1}and it put a lot of pressure,
and the things with Tawni

33:59.737 --> 34:01.172
that were said,
and, you know,

34:01.239 --> 34:02.707
I wanted to believe him
so badly, and...

34:02.774 --> 34:04.375
{\an1}Hmm.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.375
You know what I mean?

34:04.442 --> 34:06.477
{\an5}You always want to trust
the person you're in
a relationship with.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.480
It made me come
to the conclusion

34:09.547 --> 34:10.748
that we weren't good
for each other.

34:10.815 --> 34:12.283
{\an1}You still have feelings
for him, do you?

34:12.350 --> 34:14.118
{\an1}Yeah, but I mean, of course
I have feelings for him,

34:14.185 --> 34:16.120
and I'm always going to,
like, I want us to be able

34:16.187 --> 34:18.723
to be friends, but it's like,
it's too weird to, you know?

34:18.790 --> 34:20.558
{\an1}Yeah.

34:18.790 --> 34:20.558
It was a big deal,

34:20.625 --> 34:23.194
and now it's... he's gone.

34:28.232 --> 34:29.500
I'm sorry to hear,

34:29.567 --> 34:31.268
but I never really was
the biggest fan of Ben.

you're going through this.

it's sort of like, "Bye, Ben."

do n-- what's your next move?

34:41.813 --> 34:44.114

you're kind of in
the same boat, right?

Well, we are both in
the boat, honestly.
