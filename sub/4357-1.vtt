01:55.824 --> 01:57.909
Hey, Andy!
What's up, dude?

01:57.993 --> 02:00.119
Hey, Joe. Hey, Sara.
How you doing?

02:00.204 --> 02:01.412
When you going to
get a car?

02:01.497 --> 02:04.624
Hey, why don't you get
a car? I can't afford it.

02:06.752 --> 02:10.128
So, Survivor tomorrow
night. We on? See you then.

02:10.214 --> 02:12.006
I'll bring a soda.
Hey, enjoy your orange.

02:12.090 --> 02:14.091
Okay, take care.
See you. Bye-bye.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.638
That guy needs to get laid.
Tell me something I don't know.

02:35.239 --> 02:36.489
Good morning.

02:41.787 --> 02:44.163
Excuse me. Pardon me.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.624
Sorry.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.426
Excuse me.
Thank you.

02:59.972 --> 03:02.265
Good morning.
Hey.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.433
Good morning, Paula.
Andy.

03:06.103 --> 03:08.354
Excuse me.
I have a question.

03:08.897 --> 03:13.776
What is the difference between
Hi8 and Digital video tapes?

03:14.236 --> 03:16.445
I'm not a salesman,
so, I could probably...

03:16.530 --> 03:19.240
Welcome to Smart Tech. How
can I be of service to you?

03:19.408 --> 03:20.867
Well, I was just
wondering

03:20.951 --> 03:23.452
what is the difference
between these?

03:24.288 --> 03:27.206
Well, if I'm photographing
someone as fine as yourself

03:27.291 --> 03:29.041
I'd probably go Digital.

03:31.837 --> 03:36.090
Hey, don't worry
I've been lied to

03:42.180 --> 03:45.141
My God. Sorry I'm late, man. No problem.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.518
Oh, man.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.605
I had a weekend.
Yeah?

03:50.981 --> 03:54.025
We went to Tijuana, Mexico,
you know,

03:54.109 --> 03:57.028
and we thought it would be fun,
you know, to go to this show.

03:57.112 --> 03:59.405
Everyone's, "You gotta
check out one of these shows. "

03:59.489 --> 04:02.033
And, you know,
it's a woman fucking a horse.

04:02.326 --> 04:05.578
We get there, and, you know,
we think it's gonna be awesome

04:05.662 --> 04:09.040
and it is not as cool as it
sounds like it would be, man.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.584
It's kind of gross.
Yeah.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.336
You think,
"A woman fucking a horse"

04:13.420 --> 04:15.004
and you get there
and it's

04:15.088 --> 04:16.923
a woman fucking a horse.
Yeah.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.007
It was really
giving it to her.

04:19.343 --> 04:20.426
And you know what,

04:20.510 --> 04:23.095
to be honest, I felt bad for
her. We all just felt bad for her.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.889
Yeah. Kind of felt bad for the horse.

04:24.973 --> 04:28.184
Wow, that's something.
So what did you get up to?

04:29.019 --> 04:32.313
You know, I just kind
of hung out. I was...

04:32.898 --> 04:34.273
God, Friday,
when I went home

04:34.358 --> 04:36.609
I really wanted
an egg-salad sandwich.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.694
And I was just obsessing
about it and I was like,

04:38.779 --> 04:40.780
"Man, I'm gonna
make one of those. "

04:40.864 --> 04:44.325
So Saturday I went out and
I got, like, a dozen eggs

04:44.409 --> 04:46.994
and I boiled them all
and then I just,

04:47.079 --> 04:50.039
I spent, I don't know,
probably three hours,

04:52.042 --> 04:53.709
like, three-and-a-half hours
making,

04:53.794 --> 04:57.838
you know, the mayonnaise
and the onions and paprika

04:57.923 --> 04:59.966
and, you know,
all the accoutrement.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.509
And then, by the time
I was done

05:01.593 --> 05:03.177
I just really didn't feel
like eating it.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.846
I can imagine.
And I didn't have any bread.

05:06.431 --> 05:09.725
So, you know, it was pretty
good. It was a good weekend.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.853
Sounds pretty awesome.
Yeah, it was fine.

05:12.938 --> 05:14.355
Sounds really fun.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.857
Cool.
Cool.

05:16.942 --> 05:18.359
Cool, cool.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.030
Hey, Paula.
Yeah.

05:23.115 --> 05:25.616
I gotta tell you something.
I'm really excited about it.

05:25.701 --> 05:29.078
For the first time today,
I woke up,

05:29.496 --> 05:33.499
I came to the store, and I
feel confident to say to you

05:33.709 --> 05:36.168
that if you don't take
this Michael McDonald DVD

05:36.253 --> 05:38.629
that you've been playing
for two years straight, off,

05:38.714 --> 05:40.381
I'm going to kill everyone
in the store

05:40.465 --> 05:42.341
and put a bullet
in my brain.

05:42.759 --> 05:46.137
David, what do you suggest we
play? I don't care. Anything.

05:46.388 --> 05:49.181
I would rather watch
Beautician and the Beast.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.851
I would rather listen to
Fran Drescher for eight hours

05:51.935 --> 05:53.686
than have to listen
to Michael McDonald.

05:53.770 --> 05:57.023
Nothing against him, but if I
hear Yah Mo B There one more time

05:57.107 --> 05:59.525
I'm gonna yah mo burn
this place to the ground.

05:59.609 --> 06:02.486
You're such a smart ass.
Get back on the floor.

06:04.698 --> 06:05.948
Fuck you.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.952
This is a great TV.
Nothing beats a plasma.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.620
What are you doing?
That's my customer.

06:11.705 --> 06:14.874
It certainly is not. When I came
upon her, she was unattended.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.625
No, that's my...
Wait.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.753
Go to the checkout there.
Pick up there, please.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.629
She was unattended
because I went to the back

06:20.714 --> 06:22.506
to get the brochure
that she requested.

06:22.591 --> 06:24.050
I apologize,
but it's too late.

06:24.134 --> 06:25.676
The transaction
has been completed.

06:25.761 --> 06:27.470
Then you're gonna give me
half the commission.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.013
You'll receive
none of the commission.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.556
I need to talk to Paula.
This is crazy.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.640
This is bullshit.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.559
Every time I make a sale,
you go crying to Paula.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.937
How about Jesse Jackson?
Old Jesse needs a cause.

06:37.022 --> 06:38.564
Sick of you poaching
my customers.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.149
I'm sick of your
crybaby bullshit.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.235
You wanna take this shit outside?
Just take it outside and squash it?

06:43.320 --> 06:46.572
Let's stay inside, so everybody
can see what a pussy you have, okay?

06:46.656 --> 06:50.076
Because when I remove the blade
I keep in my boot from its sheath,

06:50.160 --> 06:52.995
I can't return it
until it has spilled blood.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.332
Look, listen to me. You are
fucking with the wrong nigger.

06:56.958 --> 07:00.336
Hey! You're fucking with
the wrong sand-nigger, okay?

07:00.420 --> 07:02.922
Dude, I will hang your old ass
by your turban.

07:03.173 --> 07:06.175
Turban now? Do you see
any fucking turban here?

07:06.259 --> 07:07.927
Do I talk like a turban guy?

07:08.011 --> 07:10.888
Do I say, "Hey, Jay, do you want
a Slurpee? You want a Slurpee?"

07:10.972 --> 07:14.183
Fuck you, okay?
I was born in Brooklyn.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.309
Brooklyn, okay?

07:15.393 --> 07:18.979
My accent is a fucking
Brooklyn accent, okay? Okay?

07:19.064 --> 07:20.397
All right, man.
Calm down, dude.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.608
Look, you still covering
my shift on Friday or what?

07:22.692 --> 07:25.611
If I can keep this commission,
with pleasure.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.572
Cool, then. All right, pop.
No problem.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.202
How about Andy?
No.

07:33.537 --> 07:35.121
Come on, man. We need, what, five guys

07:35.205 --> 07:36.705
to play a decent poker
game, right? Yeah.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.332
If we cancel this,
I'm gonna have to go

07:38.416 --> 07:40.334
to some stupid-ass
birthday party with Jill

07:40.418 --> 07:41.669
and that shit
ain't happening.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.212
No.
Why not?

07:43.588 --> 07:47.133
He's a really nice guy and all
but I'm pretty sure that

07:47.217 --> 07:48.551
he is a serial murderer.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.344
Who cares, man?
He's a nice guy.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.721
I just wanna get drunk,
fucked up, and play some cards.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.932
That's great. Look, I don't
wanna end up a lampshade

07:55.016 --> 07:57.017
in some creepy apartment,
that's what I'm saying.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.145
I don't really see
any other options.

07:59.229 --> 08:01.772
Andy. My man.

08:02.774 --> 08:04.608
You got any plans
later on tonight?

08:04.693 --> 08:06.902
Why, do we have to unload
the Sony truck?

08:06.987 --> 08:10.072
No, the guys are getting
together, we're playing some poker

08:10.157 --> 08:12.158
thought, you know,
you'd wanna play.

08:12.409 --> 08:13.701
With you guys?

08:15.287 --> 08:17.746
Yeah, sure.
That would be cool.

08:17.998 --> 08:21.250
You know how to play, right?
Yeah, I play online sometimes.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.627
We're gonna play in the store. Great.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.337
Are we allowed
to do that?

08:25.422 --> 08:27.047
Absolutely not.
Yeah.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.257
Oh.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.426
Well, so I'm gonna
go tell Paula.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.053
I'm just kidding.

08:33.138 --> 08:36.222
I'm kidding. That sounds great.
Cool, I'll see you guys tonight.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.390
Okay.
All right.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.101
Oops.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.980
I almost feel guilty.
No, you don't.

08:57.495 --> 09:01.373
Going down!

09:01.458 --> 09:02.625
Dumbass.

09:03.501 --> 09:04.960
And a full house.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.795
Oh, my dukes!
What?

09:06.922 --> 09:09.256
How much fucking online poker
do you play, dawg?

09:09.341 --> 09:12.384
For like an hour or two a
night, when I'm not playing Halo.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.346
Why did you invite this guy?
He's a fucking ringer, man.

09:15.430 --> 09:16.597
This is hog shit.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.891
You, you're a fucking asshole
to tell me to come here.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.768
You tell me he was a nice guy,
didn't you?

09:20.852 --> 09:23.187
Well, fuck you people,
and fuck you, you and you...

09:23.271 --> 09:26.232
fuck and kiss my big brown
fucking ass, okay?

09:26.316 --> 09:27.691
I'm gonna see you tomorrow.

09:27.776 --> 09:28.817
Peace.
All right, man.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.069
Fuck a goat.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.280
Good night.
I love that guy.

09:33.365 --> 09:36.283
Dude, you totally...
Oh, shit, I gotta go. Damn.

09:36.368 --> 09:38.035
About to go see Ellen
in a little bit.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.578
Going now?
Late-night action, huh?

09:39.663 --> 09:40.746
Dude, you know
how it goes.

09:40.830 --> 09:43.290
Does your girlfriend know about
all these late-night visits?

09:43.375 --> 09:44.917
It's like an unspoken
agreement. Yeah.

09:45.001 --> 09:48.087
It's like a completely and
utterly unspoken agreement.

09:48.171 --> 09:50.297
If you knew her, if you knew
who I was dealing with,

09:50.382 --> 09:51.590
you wouldn't be
saying this shit.

09:51.675 --> 09:53.592
There's nothing you can't do
with this woman

09:53.677 --> 09:55.761
straight up and down. I've
done every single thing

09:55.845 --> 09:57.721
I could possibly create.
I've literally lubed up

09:57.806 --> 10:00.140
and made love to the arches
of her feet. All right.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.308
Wow!
Yeah.

10:01.393 --> 10:03.060
Foot fuck!
That's sick, man.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.687
Wow.
That is not sick.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.981
I will give you sick.
Oh, shit.

10:07.065 --> 10:09.858
I was sleeping with a woman
recently, she had the...

10:09.943 --> 10:13.237
Her tits were unbelievable.
Oh, man, I love titties.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.407
And so we're doing it
and I'm about to finish

10:16.491 --> 10:18.492
and her dog starts
licking my ass.

10:18.576 --> 10:22.871
I swear to God, I have to decide,
do I finish or do I stop the dog?

10:22.956 --> 10:24.832
I know your nasty ass.
He finished.

10:24.916 --> 10:27.293
I finished.
And then I stole the dog.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.212
No, I didn't, but...

10:30.505 --> 10:32.965
You know, sometimes,
Amy and I would make love

10:33.049 --> 10:35.134
till it was almost like
we weren't two people

10:35.218 --> 10:37.886
but we were two spirits
or something.

10:37.971 --> 10:41.140
Our souls were connected in
this way, I can't describe it.

10:41.224 --> 10:44.810
Time stood still. It was like
we were sharing the same heart.

10:44.894 --> 10:48.689
Stop, man! Why do you always come
and kill the vibe with those things?

10:48.773 --> 10:50.733
"Sharing the same heart,"
that's like some

10:50.817 --> 10:51.942
Britney Spears shit, man.

10:52.027 --> 10:54.987
This is three grown ass men, don't
nobody want to hear that shit.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.323
Yeah, man, come on, nobody
wants to hear that shit.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.992
Thank you, Andy. Dude,
you broke up two years ago.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.494
You get over it at some
point. Two years, man.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.121
You need to get past that

11:04.205 --> 11:07.416
because no ass is worth
thinking that much about

11:07.751 --> 11:09.001
I always say.

11:09.252 --> 11:10.669
Andy, do me a favor.

11:10.754 --> 11:14.173
Would you please help him redeem
himself by telling a real sex story?

11:14.257 --> 11:15.257
Yes.

11:16.551 --> 11:19.928
I don't... You know what,
I'm a gentleman and I don't...

11:20.472 --> 11:21.805
I don't kiss and tell.

11:21.890 --> 11:25.225
Fuck it, I raise you.
Nastiest shit you've ever done.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.186
I'm talking about nasty.

11:28.438 --> 11:29.438
Wow.

11:29.606 --> 11:32.608
So many stories are running
through my head right now.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.195
I dated this girl

11:36.780 --> 11:40.366
for a while, and she was
really a nasty freak.

11:40.450 --> 11:45.287
She just loved to get down
with sex all the time.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.915
She was like, any time of day,
she was like,

11:47.999 --> 11:50.751
"Yeah, let's go.
I'm so nasty. "

11:50.835 --> 11:52.127
And I'd be nailing her.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.420
Oh, shit.
She'd be like,

11:53.505 --> 11:55.881
"Oh, you're nailing me. Cool. "

11:56.132 --> 11:59.551
She talk dirty to you?
She loved to dirty-talk.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.429
Totally into it.
She'd be like,

12:02.514 --> 12:07.476
"Yeah, let's screw, let's...
I wanna fuck. "

12:08.478 --> 12:10.145
God, it was so dirty.

12:10.605 --> 12:14.691
She'd be like, "Me so horny,
me love you long time. "

12:14.984 --> 12:15.984
So...

12:16.069 --> 12:18.946
So what were the titties like?
Yeah, describe her...

12:19.030 --> 12:21.156
Yeah, she had great tits.

12:21.282 --> 12:24.410
No, I mean, like, detailed.
Did she have, like, you know,

12:24.494 --> 12:26.245
them little pink teeny
nipples. Oh, yeah.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.831
Or like the long
National Geograqhic nipples.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.458
You have like the bumpy Braille
nipples, the Stevie Wonders.

12:31.543 --> 12:32.918
Yeah, they were nice.

12:33.002 --> 12:36.213
You know, when you, like, you
grab a woman's breast and it's...

12:36.548 --> 12:38.757
And you feel it and

12:39.551 --> 12:43.512
it feels like a bag of sand
when you're touching it.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.181
Bag of sand?

12:48.435 --> 12:50.436
You know what I mean.
Why don't we just play?

12:50.520 --> 12:52.187
Why don't you just
deal the cards?

12:52.272 --> 12:53.897
What are you
talking about?

12:53.982 --> 12:56.024
Have you ever felt
a breast before, man?

12:56.109 --> 12:57.109
Yes.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.736
Dude, are you gay?
No, I'm not gay.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.488
I've been with
tons of women.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.532
I touched a guy's balls
at Hebrew school once.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.576
Dude, it's not a big deal.
You like to fuck guys.

13:05.660 --> 13:08.287
I'm cool. I got friends
who fuck guys, in jail.

13:08.496 --> 13:09.705
No, I'm not gay.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.791
No, I've borked a lot of women
in my day.

13:12.876 --> 13:14.001
You've "borked"?

13:14.210 --> 13:17.045
Hold up.
Yo, answer this question,

13:18.047 --> 13:22.384
Are you a virgin?

13:22.552 --> 13:24.803
Yeah, not since I was 10.

13:24.888 --> 13:27.431
It all makes sense.
You're a virgin.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.017
I am... Shut up.
How does that happen?

13:30.101 --> 13:31.518
He's a fucking virgin.

13:31.603 --> 13:34.897
I knew it. That makes so much
sense, man. Look, he's a virgin.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.274
You guys are hilarious. All
right, come on, don't be mean.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.443
I'm not being mean. I'm
trying to help the partner out.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.236
I'm trying to say
I wanna get you laid, dude.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.488
I understand
what's going on.

13:42.572 --> 13:45.407
You guys are so up your asses.

13:45.617 --> 13:49.036
From now on, your dick is my
dick. I'm getting you some pussy.

13:59.464 --> 14:03.926
A bag of sand! Come on, man!
You could do better than that.

14:04.344 --> 14:07.804
God, me so horny?
Me so stupid!

14:13.895 --> 14:15.437
Oh, come on.

14:18.650 --> 14:21.193
It's gonna be fine.
They don't even remember.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.028
Those guys are cool.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.329
This is gonna be bad.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.123
Yeah, well,
virgin's not a dirty word.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.209
You know what's a dirty word,
is asshole

14:37.293 --> 14:38.794
and that's what you guys are.

14:38.878 --> 14:42.130
You know, I may not have had
sex, but I could fuck you up.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.342
Yeah.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.015
Come on.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.853
Hey, David.
Hey, Andy.

15:00.024 --> 15:02.109
What's up?
Cal, good morning.

15:07.657 --> 15:09.157
Hey, Andy.
Hey.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.159
We're gonna have to get you
some punani.

15:13.746 --> 15:17.082
Andy, it's going down,
partner. We're gonna be...

15:19.502 --> 15:21.753
This for you, partner,
this for you.

15:21.838 --> 15:24.756
Waves of them coming at you
on Friday, Saturday.

15:24.841 --> 15:27.426
By Sunday,
your nuts gonna be drained.

15:27.510 --> 15:31.179
Hey, Andy, don't let him bother
you. It's okay not to have sex.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.640
Not everybody
is a pussy magnet.

15:33.725 --> 15:37.686
What are you? 25?
I'm 40.

15:37.854 --> 15:40.439
Holy shit, man.
You've got to get on that.

15:40.690 --> 15:44.901
Life isn't about sex. Life
is about children and passion.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.194
Yeah.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.363
And spirit.
Yeah, life's about passion.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.991
It's not about fucking
and balls and pussy.

15:51.075 --> 15:54.369
It's about love.
It's about people.

15:55.163 --> 15:57.956
It's about connection.
It's all about connections.

15:58.041 --> 16:02.210
It's not about cock and ass
and tits and butthole pleasures.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.004
It's not about
butthole pleasures at all.

16:04.088 --> 16:07.299
It's not about this rusty
trombone and dirty Sanchez.

16:07.383 --> 16:10.385
Please stop.
And Cincinnati bowtie.

16:10.553 --> 16:15.307
And your pussy juice cocktail
and this shit-stained balls.

16:15.391 --> 16:16.850
Mooj, just please stop.
Just relax...

16:16.934 --> 16:19.144
All right.
That's enough, party's over.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.313
Let the virgin
get back to work.

16:25.568 --> 16:26.735
Andy!

16:27.028 --> 16:29.404
Andy, come on.
We were just kidding.

16:29.739 --> 16:30.822
Pointless.

16:30.907 --> 16:33.158
Andy, nobody cares
that you're a virgin.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.077
Don't be such a baby.

16:35.203 --> 16:37.537
They were just having fun.
They didn't mean anything.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.414
Get away from me, David.
Wait a minute.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.416
Stop following me!
Hold up.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.838
Hold on. I'm gonna
have to quit my job now.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.173
You don't have to
quit your job.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.050
You know what, I don't wanna
go out with you guys.

16:50.134 --> 16:51.468
Fine.
Okay? I don't need your help.

16:51.552 --> 16:54.012
Okay, fine, you don't have to
go out with us if you don't want.

16:54.097 --> 16:56.723
You know what, I respect
women, I love women.

16:57.058 --> 17:00.435
I respect them so much that I
completely stay away from them.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.896
Okay.
I have a very fulfilling life.

17:06.651 --> 17:10.487
And now, I am making
your silver pants blue.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.490
Get some roadburn, come on!

17:13.782 --> 17:15.951
Come on, sucker!

17:16.035 --> 17:19.371
Now, pretty ladies
around the world

17:19.539 --> 17:21.623
Got a weird thing
to show you

17:22.959 --> 17:24.542
Oh, my God!

17:28.714 --> 17:31.550
Hey, Will and Grace,
back to work.

17:31.634 --> 17:33.802
Hey, Haziz, can you just
give us a second?

17:33.886 --> 17:36.179
We're just kind of
in the middle of something.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.931
I'm on my break, okay?

17:38.015 --> 17:40.434
Fuck off, Haziz.
Leave us alone, all right?

17:40.518 --> 17:42.602
Fuck off? Fuck you!
Fuck you!

17:42.687 --> 17:44.646
Fuck you! Fuck off.
Fuck off.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.440
I'm gonna kick you
in the nuts, asshole.

17:46.524 --> 17:49.734
Hey, hey! Watch the language,
okay? I have a family.

17:49.819 --> 17:50.902
Watch how you talk to me!

17:50.987 --> 17:53.989
It's a free country, Bambi. I
can smoke out here if I want to.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.323
Smoke my pole.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.701
You are a very unkind man.
Get inside!

17:57.785 --> 17:59.077
This is not professional.

17:59.162 --> 18:01.538
Paula,
this asshole over here...

18:01.539 --> 18:03.331
It's okay.
Paula!

18:03.458 --> 18:05.917
It's all right. Come on.
You know, it's just...

18:06.461 --> 18:08.295
So, how could this
not have happened?

18:08.379 --> 18:10.297
It just never happened.

18:10.715 --> 18:14.134
When I was young, I tried,
and it didn't happen.

18:14.760 --> 18:18.180
And then I got older and I got
more and more nervous

18:18.347 --> 18:21.725
because it hadn't happened
yet. And I got kind of

18:22.685 --> 18:25.353
weirded out about it. Then
it really didn't happen

18:25.438 --> 18:28.648
and then, I don't know,
I just kind of stopped trying.

18:29.192 --> 18:31.359
Do you want to give it
another shot?

18:31.444 --> 18:33.195
Maybe it's too late.

18:34.322 --> 18:37.115
Sometimes I feel that
it is just too late for me.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.493
No, that's crazy.

18:39.577 --> 18:42.537
You're 40 years old.
You know, 40 is the new 20.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.623
You wanna spend the next
60 years of your life

18:44.707 --> 18:46.166
never experiencing sex?

18:46.250 --> 18:48.293
And not just sex, but love

18:48.377 --> 18:53.340
and a relationship, and laughing
and cuddling and all that shit.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.300
I don't know.

18:56.552 --> 18:59.679
I wouldn't know what to do.
Look, you gotta take a risk.

18:59.764 --> 19:01.515
You gotta risk it.
Look at me.

19:01.516 --> 19:03.391
I went out with this girl
for four months

19:03.476 --> 19:05.227
and it was the greatest,

19:05.895 --> 19:07.604
greatest thing in my life.

19:08.564 --> 19:12.442
Until she went down on this
guy in an Escalade, I think.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.653
And, you know,
instead of saying,

19:14.737 --> 19:17.697
"Okay, what am I doing
that caused this behavior?"

19:17.782 --> 19:19.616
I dumped her. Stupid decision.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.536
I spent the last two years
of my life regretting it.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.496
Why don't you
get her back right now?

19:24.580 --> 19:26.665
Because she's dating
this pot dealer.

19:26.749 --> 19:28.375
Stupid horrible decision.

19:28.459 --> 19:31.628
But, hey, that's her journey,
you know. I gotta respect that.

19:31.712 --> 19:32.963
I gotta give her the space.

19:33.047 --> 19:36.967
She wants to be some immature
little bitch and blow everybody,

19:37.051 --> 19:39.052
that's love, man.
It sounds horrible.

19:39.136 --> 19:41.263
Of course it's horrible.
It's suffering

19:41.347 --> 19:43.848
and it's pain and it's...
You know, you lose weight

19:43.933 --> 19:45.433
and then you
put back on weight

19:45.518 --> 19:47.602
and then you call them
a bunch of times

19:47.687 --> 19:51.022
and you try and email and then
they move or they change their email

19:51.107 --> 19:52.649
but that's just love.

19:53.109 --> 19:55.026
Do you realize that
this is the first time

19:55.111 --> 19:57.404
we've spoken for more than,
like, 30 seconds?

19:57.488 --> 19:58.572
Uh-huh.

19:58.948 --> 20:01.783
It's kind of nice.
Come out with us this weekend.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.953
No pressure.
We'll just have a good time.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.789
Okay, yeah, I will.
I'll give it a shot.

20:07.873 --> 20:08.873
Great.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.167
But I'm not going to have sex
with anybody.

20:11.252 --> 20:13.962
Good, sex should be
the last thing on your mind.

20:25.975 --> 20:27.851
Logjam. Hi.

20:33.774 --> 20:34.774
Shit.

20:38.362 --> 20:39.529
Oh, God.

20:43.826 --> 20:44.993
Sorry.

20:46.621 --> 20:48.496
See you later.
Thanks for the dance.

20:58.007 --> 21:00.008
I'm okay. It's all right.

21:06.057 --> 21:07.932
Oh, come on, bus!

21:14.690 --> 21:16.858
Oh, come on, dogs!

21:19.987 --> 21:21.905
Shit! You gotta be kidding me.

21:38.214 --> 21:41.883
I mean, I'm kind of nervous.
I never had oral sex before.

21:42.385 --> 21:47.013
Jennifer told me how to do it.
It's gonna kick ass.

21:53.437 --> 21:55.146
What are you doing?

21:55.231 --> 21:56.648
Okay, just...
We're almost there.

21:57.775 --> 22:00.151
We have one.
Houston, we have one.

22:00.903 --> 22:03.154
You'll pull my
fucking hair out!

22:03.239 --> 22:05.115
We did it.
God!

22:05.199 --> 22:06.866
Oh, my God,
you came in your pants.

22:06.951 --> 22:09.744
What did you do?
I had some Cream of Wheat.

22:10.246 --> 22:12.580
You know what else is sexy?
What?

22:13.124 --> 22:14.833
Me
Yeah?

22:14.917 --> 22:16.084
Sucking

22:17.461 --> 22:20.004
on your

22:20.589 --> 22:21.589
toe.

22:21.716 --> 22:23.591
That's what you want to suck on? Yeah.

22:23.676 --> 22:27.971
It's just so big and thick.
Okay.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.015
Yeah.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.019
That tickles.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.231
I'm sorry. Oh, no.

22:38.315 --> 22:40.358
Your nose is bleeding.
You think?

22:40.443 --> 22:42.819
I'm sorry.
I'm hot.

22:43.070 --> 22:45.113
But, now,
you can't have any of this.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.824
You should just
give up forever!

22:56.667 --> 22:58.418
Cal, what do you think?
Is this too yellow?

22:58.502 --> 22:59.544
No.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.963
What's Curious George like
in real life?

23:02.047 --> 23:03.256
Come on, man.

23:12.975 --> 23:15.393
Wow, this is
pretty crowded.

23:15.686 --> 23:18.563
Yeah. Well,
it's $9 beer night.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.149
Okay, look now.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.443
So, this is what's about
to happen, all right?

23:23.527 --> 23:26.237
You about to go run down
some drunk chicks, all right?

23:26.322 --> 23:28.740
And don't confuse that with
tipsy. We talking about drunk.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.825
I want vomit in the hair,
bruised-up knees.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.410
A broken heel is a plus.

23:32.495 --> 23:33.995
That's what you
want to find, okay?

23:34.079 --> 23:36.873
No, Dave already told me I
didn't have to have sex tonight.

23:36.957 --> 23:37.957
And now he's gone, so...

23:38.042 --> 23:40.043
Dude, just stop thinking
for a minute, all right?

23:40.127 --> 23:41.753
You ain't got to think
on this one.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.755
All you got to do
is use your instinct.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.256
Show me your instincts.

23:45.341 --> 23:48.092
My head, my heart.
I follow my heart.

23:48.177 --> 23:50.762
Now, I'm gonna show you this
one time, all right?

23:50.846 --> 23:53.598
Instincts.
Show me your instincts.

23:54.183 --> 23:56.392
Show me your instincts.
They're right here.

23:56.727 --> 23:58.520
Own your instincts.

23:58.687 --> 24:01.606
All you doing is using
your instinct. That's it.

24:01.690 --> 24:04.442
That's how a tiger know
he got to tackle a gazelle.

24:04.527 --> 24:06.402
There's a code
written in his DNA.

24:06.529 --> 24:08.196
It says, "Tackle the gazelle. " Okay.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.449
And believe it or not, in every man,
there's a code written that says,

24:11.534 --> 24:13.451
"Tackle drunk bitches. "
No.

24:13.536 --> 24:17.038
You know what,
I don't feel comfortable

24:18.290 --> 24:20.542
hitting on drunk "bitches,"
you know.

24:20.626 --> 24:21.793
I don't think that's right.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.044
Okay, hold up.

24:23.128 --> 24:25.964
First of all, you making it out
to be some kind of bad thing.

24:26.048 --> 24:28.466
I didn't use bitches in a
derogatory sense. You did.

24:28.551 --> 24:30.260
It just does...
This doesn't feel right.

24:30.344 --> 24:33.179
Of course it don't feel right. What
has felt right for you didn't work.

24:33.264 --> 24:35.890
You need to try
some wrong, dawg.

24:38.018 --> 24:40.436
Okay, how do I tell
which ones are drunk?

24:40.521 --> 24:42.146
Now you're talking.
All right, check this out.

24:42.273 --> 24:44.023
You see this redhead over here? Where?

24:44.108 --> 24:47.652
With the big old titties. I'm
not gonna stare at a woman.

24:47.736 --> 24:50.363
Dawg, I'm not telling you
to stare at nobody.

24:50.489 --> 24:53.241
I'm telling you to use your
peripherals. Now look at me.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.784
See. Look. See?
Yeah.

24:55.244 --> 24:56.578
I'm not looking at you.

24:57.288 --> 24:59.873
No. I'm looking at...
You're looking at her?

25:01.750 --> 25:05.336
What do you want me to do? I
want you to use your peripherals.

25:05.713 --> 25:07.630
See? I'm not looking at you.

25:08.716 --> 25:12.927
No. See, I'm looking at the redhead
at 3:00 with the big titties.

25:13.137 --> 25:16.014
You see her, racked up
right there, see her?

25:16.432 --> 25:17.932
Yes.
Yeah.

25:18.183 --> 25:21.436
You find one with the peripherals. Okay.

25:21.812 --> 25:24.939
You see, over by the post.

25:25.733 --> 25:26.941
It looks like a...

25:27.026 --> 25:28.735
It's either a ficus...

25:28.819 --> 25:30.570
It might be
a rubber tree plant.

25:30.863 --> 25:33.698
All right, if you're making
a joke, dawg, it's not funny.

25:33.782 --> 25:36.367
I see a blonde
and she's very pretty.

25:36.452 --> 25:38.870
Better, okay. All right.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.997
Now with your peripherals
Yeah.

25:41.081 --> 25:43.541
You got to scope out
a hot, drunk chick.

25:43.709 --> 25:45.043
And then you should
make your move.

25:45.127 --> 25:46.961
Okay? All right.
Yes.

25:47.129 --> 25:49.964
And remember, it's more important
that she's drunk than she's hot.

25:50.049 --> 25:52.467
For this first one. Go get
her. Peripherals, though.

25:52.551 --> 25:53.718
All the way.

25:54.845 --> 25:56.137
All peripherals.

26:03.479 --> 26:04.771
That boy is stubborn.

26:07.650 --> 26:10.944
Hi, I'm Andy.
You look comfortable.

26:11.153 --> 26:13.613
Can I get you
another cocktail?

26:13.697 --> 26:14.822
Too drunk.

26:14.907 --> 26:18.326
But you got the right idea.
But clinically alive.

26:20.496 --> 26:21.454
Hey!
Yo!

26:21.538 --> 26:23.915
I'm having trouble
finding the drunk people.

26:23.999 --> 26:26.250
You want to know where
there's one? Yeah.

26:26.335 --> 26:30.171
I. I, Captain Yellowshirts.

26:31.340 --> 26:33.424
Okay. Have a good one.

26:33.509 --> 26:34.717
Yo!
What?

26:34.802 --> 26:37.929
I met a girl and she's here
with a bachelorette party

26:38.013 --> 26:40.056
and they invited us
to party with them.

26:40.349 --> 26:43.267
Okay, that's good.
It's so good

26:43.352 --> 26:44.978
because no one is hornier
than a girl

26:45.062 --> 26:47.689
who's about to watch her
friend get married to a guy.

26:47.773 --> 26:49.190
It's so funny.

26:53.362 --> 26:57.115
So we just decided because this
is my last night as a free woman

26:57.199 --> 27:00.326
before I marry Dan,
that we would just wig out.

27:00.536 --> 27:02.203
We're wigging out!

27:03.205 --> 27:06.040
You guys are hilarious.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.543
Wait a minute.

27:08.627 --> 27:12.130
Yes, Mr. President. Yes,
the erection results are in.

27:13.382 --> 27:16.217
Hey, guys, look,
it's Dr. Seuss' penis.

27:16.677 --> 27:18.469
I really mean this.

27:19.388 --> 27:21.848
Hey, everybody,
who wants penis cake?

27:22.141 --> 27:23.182
I do.

27:23.308 --> 27:26.561
She does. Hey, you guys, Betty Cocker.

27:28.731 --> 27:30.314
What a good guy. What a...

27:30.399 --> 27:32.358
Dan, the guy
Robin's marrying

27:32.443 --> 27:35.653
is such a good guy.

27:35.738 --> 27:37.321
He sounds like a good guy.

27:37.406 --> 27:40.450
I hated him for like two years
'cause he cheated on me.

27:40.743 --> 27:41.951
But...

27:44.413 --> 27:46.622
he's really changed now.

27:47.791 --> 27:50.877
He's a really good guy now.
Your friends seem nice.

27:50.961 --> 27:53.463
You have really kind eyes,
you know that?

27:53.672 --> 27:56.924
Thanks. Your hat
has sequins.

27:59.511 --> 28:05.266
Mmm.

28:11.231 --> 28:13.441
Your hands are on my belt.
What?

28:13.525 --> 28:15.526
Your hands are on my belt.
I'm sorry.

28:15.611 --> 28:16.819
It's good.

28:17.780 --> 28:18.988
You're cute.

28:19.073 --> 28:21.240
This is kind of lame.
You wanna get out of here?

28:21.325 --> 28:22.825
Okay, yeah.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.457
Yeah.
Fuck.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.334
Come on.
Okay.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.049
You wanna drive?

28:38.133 --> 28:40.635
I don't have a car
with me here, so...

28:40.719 --> 28:42.595
That's cool, I'll just suck it up.

28:44.556 --> 28:45.723
I'm driving.

28:46.892 --> 28:47.892
Are you drunk?

28:47.976 --> 28:49.519
No, I didn't have anything
to drink.

28:49.603 --> 28:51.813
Blow into this?
Okay.

28:56.902 --> 29:00.738
What is this? The judge
recommended I get one.

29:07.329 --> 29:10.832
Whoa, okay. Wow.
That's fast.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.253
Okay.
Come on, you're in the lasso.

29:18.382 --> 29:20.007
? Missy be puttin' it down?

29:20.092 --> 29:21.175
? I'm the hottest round?

29:21.260 --> 29:22.760
? I told y'all
mother-uh?

29:22.845 --> 29:24.011
? Y'all can't
stop me now?

29:24.096 --> 29:25.179
? Listen to me now?

29:25.264 --> 29:26.514
? I'm lastin' 20 rounds?

29:26.598 --> 29:28.057
? And if you want me, people?

29:28.142 --> 29:29.684
? Then come on
get me now?

29:30.602 --> 29:34.647
And Dan's like, "You're
such a B-I-T-C-H, bitch!"

29:35.858 --> 29:38.693
And I'm like,
"You're the bitch, bitch. "

29:38.777 --> 29:40.486
You know?
Yeah.

29:40.571 --> 29:42.280
What was your name again?

29:42.948 --> 29:44.073
Andy.
Andy.

29:44.158 --> 29:48.911
Let me tell you something,
Andy. Don't ever be named Dan.

29:49.204 --> 29:51.956
Dan rhymes with man,
and men jerk off.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.499
And he was a jerk-off.

29:53.584 --> 29:56.294
Do you know what I mean?
Look out! The car!

29:56.587 --> 29:59.547
Wow.
I like you.

29:59.965 --> 30:01.465
You're not a...

30:03.802 --> 30:04.844
Ugh.

30:04.928 --> 30:07.972
I think I ate some bad
shellfish sandwich or something.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.309
You're cute.
No.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.818
That tasted good.
That tasted like shellfish.

30:22.112 --> 30:24.864
Look out! Sorry.

30:25.908 --> 30:26.991
Watch it!

30:29.411 --> 30:31.913
Do you think I'm pretty?
Oh, yes.

30:32.206 --> 30:33.664
Oh, God, yes!

30:35.125 --> 30:39.462
You're not looking at me.
Yes, you're pretty.

30:39.546 --> 30:42.215
Do you think I'm pretty?
Look at me.

30:42.299 --> 30:45.343
Look at me!
I'm looking! You're pretty!

30:45.427 --> 30:47.845
God, I just wanna live!

30:49.473 --> 30:52.016
God, I hope
I get my period soon.

30:52.184 --> 30:55.645
I am in a bad mood.
Okay.

30:55.729 --> 30:58.564
I'm so tired.

30:59.316 --> 31:00.691
Hey, whoa!

31:01.860 --> 31:04.278
Oh, God! Turn away!

31:04.613 --> 31:06.781
Hey, get off the wheel.

31:08.492 --> 31:11.077
You're not gonna get in
my pants acting like that.

31:11.161 --> 31:12.703
I'm starving.

31:12.955 --> 31:15.498
Let's get some
fucking French toast.

31:17.542 --> 31:21.170
Okay, here we are.
Oh, God, we made it.

31:21.255 --> 31:22.630
Home sweet home.

31:23.924 --> 31:25.591
Oh, mommy!

31:29.471 --> 31:33.266
Are you okay? The fucker
came out of nowhere.

31:34.685 --> 31:37.061
Okay. We're okay.

31:40.274 --> 31:41.607
Are you okay?

31:42.234 --> 31:44.402
Well, are you...
What's the matter?

31:50.075 --> 31:51.367
I'm sorry.

31:51.910 --> 31:55.413
That's okay. I think I
kind of had that coming.

31:56.164 --> 31:58.332
I'll still have sex with you
if you want.

31:58.417 --> 32:01.419
You know what, I think I'm gonna
pass on the sex, if you don't mind.

32:01.503 --> 32:04.005
At least I don't have
to work out tomorrow.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.632
Did you have a daiquiri tonight? Yeah.

32:06.717 --> 32:07.758
I thought you might.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.677
It was a very bad night.

32:11.596 --> 32:12.680
Yeah, laugh.

32:12.764 --> 32:15.099
You know what, you guys
wouldn't be laughing right now...

32:15.183 --> 32:18.769
if some girl had just vomited
shellfish sandwich into your mouth.

32:19.896 --> 32:21.731
You know what, you're right,
it's my bad.

32:21.815 --> 32:23.816
Let me apologize to you
first of all...

32:23.900 --> 32:27.695
for not mentioning in detail that
when you pick up a drunk woman...

32:27.779 --> 32:30.406
who's falling down
on her way out of the bar...

32:30.532 --> 32:33.367
that you should probably
drive. I drive a bike.

32:33.452 --> 32:36.996
Okay, Mr. Schwinn-fucking-Armstrong,
who asked you to drive a bike?

32:37.080 --> 32:39.206
You know what, I'm not the
only person in the world...

32:39.291 --> 32:40.458
who rides a bike.

32:40.542 --> 32:43.210
Yeah, everyone rides a bike,
when they're fucking six.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.421
Why don't you kiss something?

32:45.505 --> 32:48.632
Because this is over,
you guys, okay?

32:48.717 --> 32:50.384
Can I just interject
for a second?

32:50.469 --> 32:51.844
Let me just say...

32:51.970 --> 32:54.305
you're putting the pussy up
on this pedestal.

32:54.389 --> 32:55.890
You're just building
the pussy up, man.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.391
What are you even
talking about?

32:57.476 --> 32:59.393
"Building the pussy up,"
what does that mean?

32:59.478 --> 33:04.190
You making the pussy into this great
big Greek goddess named Pussalia...

33:04.274 --> 33:05.441
and what you're doing is...

33:05.525 --> 33:08.819
you're psyching yourself into
thinking it's some impossible feat.

33:08.904 --> 33:10.237
Yeah, I think
you're right.

33:10.322 --> 33:12.281
I'm putting the pussy up
on a pedestal.

33:12.366 --> 33:13.783
Right.
That's it.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.701
It's "Pussalia," right?

33:15.827 --> 33:18.287
Look where you going. I don't
wanna say the word anymore.

33:18.372 --> 33:20.623
Say what word?
"Pussy. " I don't wanna say it.

33:20.707 --> 33:23.000
Fuck it.
"Pussy" is a scientific word.

33:23.085 --> 33:25.169
Dude! New pants, man.

33:25.712 --> 33:26.796
You know what, Dave?

33:26.880 --> 33:29.340
You know, you said there wasn't
gonna be any pressure at all.

33:29.424 --> 33:31.050
I'm not pressuring you.
Excuse me.

33:31.134 --> 33:32.760
Can one of you guys
help me, please?

33:32.844 --> 33:34.387
No hablo English, lady.

33:35.806 --> 33:38.099
I actually am helping
a customer right now.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.518
Okay, well...
I'm on break.

33:40.602 --> 33:43.145
But our stock supervisor
is very knowledgeable.

33:43.230 --> 33:45.731
He can answer all of your
questions and he'd love to help you.

33:45.816 --> 33:46.857
Thank you.

33:46.942 --> 33:48.526
Have a nice day.
You, too.

33:49.528 --> 33:53.781
Great, okay. Hi, I'm Trish.
Hi, Andy is my name.

33:54.282 --> 33:57.368
This one looks pretty good.
You don't wanna buy that VCR.

33:57.452 --> 33:58.452
I don't?

33:58.537 --> 34:00.287
No, actually to be
totally honest with you...

34:00.372 --> 34:01.705
you don't wanna buy
any VCR.

34:01.790 --> 34:03.457
It's a dead technology.

34:03.542 --> 34:07.670
It's like getting
an eight-track player.

34:07.754 --> 34:10.130
Yeah.
Or a Betamax.

34:10.215 --> 34:12.299
You know what, actually
I'd recommend this one.

34:12.384 --> 34:13.467
This is a dual.

34:13.552 --> 34:16.637
You've got the VCR
and DVD combo.

34:16.721 --> 34:20.224
So, you know, that technology
would be probably pretty good for...

34:20.516 --> 34:21.641
Six months or so?
Yeah.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.018
That's good.

34:23.145 --> 34:25.062
At best. Sorry.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.565
No.
As good as it gets.

34:27.732 --> 34:28.899
Okay, that sounds good,
then.

34:28.984 --> 34:30.067
Okay, all right.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.319
It's perfect.
Sorry.

34:32.404 --> 34:33.654
Coming through.

34:33.989 --> 34:35.072
Okay.

34:35.157 --> 34:37.867
God, you know, it's so funny,
I work right across the street...

34:37.951 --> 34:39.368
and I've never been
in this place.

34:39.453 --> 34:40.870
Really? Where at?
Yeah.

34:40.954 --> 34:43.581
The "We Sell Your Stuff On eBay" store.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.083
Yes.
And that's the name?

34:46.333 --> 34:48.710
Yeah, I was
looking for something...

34:49.045 --> 34:51.797
you know, obvious.
So I chose that.

34:51.922 --> 34:54.091
I don't understand.
So, what, you do what?

34:54.384 --> 34:56.342
Well, I take the stuff
that you don't want...

34:56.428 --> 34:58.512
and then I "sell" it
on eBay.

34:58.597 --> 35:01.098
But you don't actually
sell anything in the store?

35:02.184 --> 35:03.767
No. I don't.

35:04.352 --> 35:06.437
So why do you have a store?

35:06.521 --> 35:07.813
I don't know.

35:08.023 --> 35:11.150
No, I think it's because, you know,
I wanna maybe look professional

35:11.234 --> 35:14.195
and not like a crazy person who's
just gonna steal all your shit.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.614
Sure. I didn't
mean anything by that.

35:16.698 --> 35:18.157
No, it's okay.

35:18.450 --> 35:22.036
You know what, you should come
by sometime if you want, you know

35:22.120 --> 35:23.871
see it for yourself,
check it out.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.539
I'll check out
your empty store.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.834
Yeah, it's the one across
the street that's not empty.

35:30.170 --> 35:31.670
Here's my number. So...

35:32.214 --> 35:34.673
All right.
So, just anytime.

35:35.467 --> 35:38.344
Why do I need your number if
you're across the street, though?

35:39.471 --> 35:42.473
I don't really have a good
answer for that, Andy. I just...

35:42.557 --> 35:44.517
Sorry.
Just giving it to you.

35:44.768 --> 35:47.811
So I'll write you up, and I'll
meet you over at the register.

35:47.938 --> 35:49.563
Okay. And check you out... Check out.

35:49.648 --> 35:50.981
Okay, see you over there.
Okay.

35:51.066 --> 35:52.066
Okay.

35:52.526 --> 35:54.610
Awful chatty.
Hey...

35:54.986 --> 35:57.071
Look, I think she gave me
her number.

35:57.155 --> 35:59.698
She wrote down her number, but
I think she gave me her number.

35:59.783 --> 36:01.116
No, she gave you.
Dude, man.

36:01.201 --> 36:02.785
See, you still mad at me?

36:02.869 --> 36:04.745
No, I was never.
Right, you see what I mean?

36:04.829 --> 36:06.705
Yeah, we gonna
celebrate it, man. Yeah.

36:06.790 --> 36:08.207
This is pretty cool.
Yeah.

36:08.291 --> 36:10.209
Unbelievable. Come on,
give him some credit, man.

36:10.293 --> 36:11.460
The man pulled a number.

36:11.545 --> 36:14.088
It's just... I was in...
I can't believe that happened.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.631
What you did was you zoned in.

36:15.715 --> 36:17.883
Man, she just gave me
her number.

36:18.176 --> 36:22.680
That's great, man. I'm telling
you, love is a mysterious fig.

36:22.764 --> 36:23.764
It is.

36:23.848 --> 36:26.642
Okay, here's a question.
When should I call her?

36:27.352 --> 36:28.477
You like her?
Yeah.

36:28.562 --> 36:30.020
You definitely
don't want to call her.

36:30.105 --> 36:31.730
When is the next Olympics?

36:31.815 --> 36:33.148
So what you just
got to do is...

36:33.233 --> 36:35.109
just get you a bunch
of these hood rats...

36:35.193 --> 36:36.610
run through them,
just knock them out.

36:36.695 --> 36:37.736
Boom, boom, boom.

36:37.821 --> 36:40.322
And once you've done slayed
like 20, 30 of them hood rats...

36:40.407 --> 36:43.117
now you ready to go up
to the upper echelon type ho.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.202
You know what I mean?
I'm not a big ho runner.

36:45.328 --> 36:47.121
My uncle used to drive
a ho runner.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.039
Screw these analogies.
What he's saying is...

36:49.124 --> 36:51.125
you are going to be so bad
at sex the first time...

36:51.209 --> 36:53.252
you don't want to have sex
with someone you like...

36:53.336 --> 36:55.629
'cause they'll think you're a
weirdo for being so lame at it.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.798
You want to have sex
with hood rats first...

36:57.882 --> 36:59.925
so that by the time you get
to the girl you do like...

37:00.010 --> 37:03.470
you're not terrible at sex,
you'll be mediocre at it.

37:03.805 --> 37:05.264
Probably still
pretty bad, though.

37:05.348 --> 37:07.558
Let's put it up for my man
for pulling that number.

37:07.642 --> 37:09.977
Way to go, man.
Politicked his ass off.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.396
You did politic.
Thanks a lot.

37:12.480 --> 37:14.523
Like a train, round the bend.
You ready?

37:48.725 --> 37:49.725
Yeah.

37:50.852 --> 37:52.019
I can't.
Do it.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.729
I can't pee in public.
Gotta do it.

37:53.813 --> 37:55.397
I've got a mental block
about it.

37:55.482 --> 37:58.692
Come on, do it.
I'm shy!

38:02.947 --> 38:05.574
I peed in public!

38:05.867 --> 38:08.202
Let me out. I can't
hear what you're saying.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.829
I don't want to be in here.
It's a soundproof room.

38:11.539 --> 38:13.707
Just learn the techniques.
Right on, man.

38:15.210 --> 38:17.086
You guys, this is not funny!

38:48.326 --> 38:49.326
Hello.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.334
Hey, what you watching?

38:57.419 --> 38:59.545
Dawn of the Dead, man.
Great.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.839
The store is slow.
Paula's gone.

39:02.006 --> 39:04.425
Yo, is Paula back?
No. She's not here.

39:04.718 --> 39:06.677
She said we can't watch
this in here. You sure?

39:06.761 --> 39:09.096
I know. Can I ask you
something in confidence?

39:09.180 --> 39:11.265
I know this is gonna
sound weird.

39:11.975 --> 39:13.434
Am I good-looking?

39:13.518 --> 39:15.185
Do you think a woman
will find me attractive?

39:15.353 --> 39:16.854
Oh, my God!

39:17.814 --> 39:20.399
Oh, my God, the blood just...
Okay, never mind.

39:20.483 --> 39:22.276
Wait, Andy. Hold up.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.320
Listen, this is embarrassing for
me. This is hard to talk about.

39:25.447 --> 39:27.906
Are you ready for my honest answer? Yes.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.743
Yeah. I think you're
a good-looking cat.

39:31.453 --> 39:32.995
I don't think
that anybody knows it...

39:33.079 --> 39:34.663
and I don't think
anybody can see it.

39:34.748 --> 39:35.914
Well,
that's why I'm asking you.

39:35.999 --> 39:38.500
You seem really well-groomed
and really put together.

39:38.585 --> 39:41.295
I mean, look, dude. You
think this was an accident?

39:41.796 --> 39:44.131
All of this right here?
Premeditated, partner.

39:44.215 --> 39:47.634
You gotta highlight your attributes,
like a diamond in the rough.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.428
You willing to make
some sacrifices?

39:49.512 --> 39:50.554
Absolutely.

39:50.638 --> 39:53.432
You see that whole Teen Wolf
thing you got going right there?

39:53.516 --> 39:55.350
You need to wax
that right out.

39:55.435 --> 39:57.311
Does it hurt?
No. Waxing don't hurt.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.313
I mean, not unless you're a
bitch. You know what I mean?

39:59.439 --> 40:00.939
It didn't hurt me.
I get it done all the time.

40:01.024 --> 40:02.691
What the fuck!

40:06.362 --> 40:08.238
Fuck that nigger up!

40:09.073 --> 40:11.533
Bitch, get out of the room!

40:14.454 --> 40:16.497
This is gonna be good.

40:16.581 --> 40:18.832
This the one right here,
right? Hi, how are you?

40:18.917 --> 40:21.001
So this is your first time
getting body waxed?

40:21.085 --> 40:22.169
Yes, it is.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.338
Take off your shirt.
Okay.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.676
We're gonna need
more wax.

40:29.761 --> 40:32.095
I'm staying.
This is gonna be good.

40:32.639 --> 40:35.432
And clear all my appointments
in the afternoon.

40:35.683 --> 40:37.017
Here we go.

40:37.352 --> 40:38.685
That feels warm.

40:41.815 --> 40:44.942
I like your sweater.
Does that come in a V-neck?

40:46.277 --> 40:48.779
She starts doing his pubes,
I'm out of here.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.366
You gonna look good
after this, man.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.659
Thanks, man.

40:54.035 --> 40:55.410
So, ready?
Yeah.

41:01.501 --> 41:03.377
You fucker!

41:04.504 --> 41:07.089
I'm sorry.
That's just your job.

41:07.173 --> 41:10.634
You want me to stop now?
No. It's okay.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.387
Let's do another one.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.097
That one little patch
looks sexy though.

41:15.181 --> 41:17.224
Does it look good?
Yeah, it looks really good.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.811
It looks man-tastic.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.146
Okay.

41:24.774 --> 41:28.402
Wow! I didn't expect that at
all. I really didn't expect that.

41:28.987 --> 41:31.363
You got it. The first one
is the only one that hurts.

41:31.447 --> 41:33.907
Yeah.
Those hairs are pretty deep.

41:33.992 --> 41:35.075
Okay.

41:35.368 --> 41:36.994
You ready?
Yup.

41:40.832 --> 41:42.583
Sucker motherfucker!

41:43.001 --> 41:45.294
You shithead! I hate you!

41:45.378 --> 41:47.170
I hate you so much!

41:48.339 --> 41:49.548
That one hurt.

41:49.632 --> 41:51.967
That one hurt
just as much as the first one.

41:52.051 --> 41:54.052
That's great, man.
Man!

41:55.972 --> 41:58.223
One, two, three.

41:59.392 --> 42:03.395
Fuck me!

42:03.855 --> 42:07.357
In the asshole!

42:09.527 --> 42:10.652
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

42:10.737 --> 42:12.321
I really don't
swear this much.

42:12.405 --> 42:13.822
You know what,
I got a weak stomach.

42:13.907 --> 42:15.657
That's all I can really take.
I'll see ya'll.

42:15.783 --> 42:18.118
Jay.
Be tough, Andy, you got it.

42:18.202 --> 42:20.287
Where did Jay go?
He went to throw up.

42:20.371 --> 42:21.663
Ready?
Yup.

42:22.373 --> 42:23.415
One, two.

42:24.626 --> 42:26.877
Cocksucker motherfucker!

42:27.045 --> 42:28.712
You pulled on two.

42:29.964 --> 42:31.632
Why didn't you
pull on three?

42:31.716 --> 42:33.050
Freddy pie hole!

42:34.761 --> 42:36.678
No! Kelly Clarkson!

42:41.893 --> 42:43.644
Ya'll done or ya'll...

42:43.728 --> 42:45.228
That's fucked up.
Oh, shit falls!

42:45.313 --> 42:46.438
That's fucked up.

42:49.442 --> 42:51.360
I hate you.

42:51.444 --> 42:53.820
Stop smiling, you jerk!

42:53.905 --> 42:55.072
You pussy.

42:55.156 --> 42:57.240
Oh, God. What's next?

42:57.617 --> 42:59.785
You're doing the nipple.
Not the nipple.

42:59.911 --> 43:01.662
Come on.
Not the nipple.

43:01.746 --> 43:03.413
Please, Cal,
hold my hand.

43:03.831 --> 43:06.625
You kidding me, man?
Hold my goddamn hand, man.

43:07.210 --> 43:09.461
Do it! Just hold.
Okay, here we go.

43:10.755 --> 43:11.755
Ready?

43:12.423 --> 43:13.715
No. Yup.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.759
One, two, three.

43:16.302 --> 43:18.762
Nipple fuck!

43:20.098 --> 43:22.557
Mika, you should
burn in hell!

43:23.017 --> 43:25.686
Okay, all right. No,
seriously, I think I'm done.

43:25.770 --> 43:28.105
I think we're done.
I think that's good.

43:30.274 --> 43:31.566
You know what, guys...

43:31.651 --> 43:34.194
this is not
a good look for me!

43:34.612 --> 43:36.405
You look like
a man-o'- lantern.

43:36.489 --> 43:38.448
Thank you very much.
Appreciate it. Thank you.

43:58.011 --> 43:59.720
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.

43:59.804 --> 44:01.430
Thank you.
Thanks.

44:01.889 --> 44:03.932
Andy,
I owe you an apology, man.

44:04.017 --> 44:07.436
I wasn't very nice to you for
the past two-and-a-half years.

44:07.520 --> 44:08.645
You were nice to me.

44:08.646 --> 44:11.314
No, I was... I thought
you were really boring and

44:11.399 --> 44:13.650
I kind of thought
you were a serial killer.

44:14.986 --> 44:16.403
I'm not joking.

44:16.904 --> 44:19.740
Hey!
Sorry. Shoot. Sorry, sorry.

44:19.824 --> 44:22.159
Don't worry. There's a lot of
padding in these.

44:22.243 --> 44:24.578
I could hurl it off the
balcony, it would be fine.

44:24.662 --> 44:26.371
Yeah. It will be fine.
We couldn't break this

44:26.456 --> 44:27.497
if we tried.
No problem.

44:27.582 --> 44:29.666
Look, you shouldn't listen
to Dave and Jay, okay?

44:29.751 --> 44:32.836
Those guys are crazy.
You should listen to me, okay?

44:32.920 --> 44:35.881
Look, there is a hot-ass girl
who works right there.

44:35.965 --> 44:39.301
There she is, in the bookstore.
You should ask her out, man.

44:41.262 --> 44:43.096
Something wrong
with her underpants.

44:43.222 --> 44:44.681
Yeah, they're not in my mouth.

44:44.766 --> 44:46.725
You know, I kind of

44:47.935 --> 44:50.145
like the woman
from the eBay store.

44:50.313 --> 44:51.354
That's great, but

44:51.439 --> 44:52.689
you're not gonna
get with anyone

44:52.774 --> 44:54.399
unless you play
the odds on this, man.

44:54.484 --> 44:56.359
You need to plant
a lot of seeds.

44:56.444 --> 44:59.946
It's like this. When I
was growing pot, I realized

45:00.490 --> 45:03.617
that the more seeds
I planted... Thank you.

45:03.701 --> 45:05.994
...the more pot
I could ultimately smoke.

45:06.079 --> 45:09.289
I think I have all the advice
that I can handle right now.

45:09.373 --> 45:10.457
Don't get bitter.

45:10.541 --> 45:13.376
I'm not bitter.
I almost lost a nipple, okay?

45:13.461 --> 45:15.253
That was Jay's idea, okay?

45:15.338 --> 45:17.923
And I wasn't going to say
anything, but waxing your chest is

45:18.007 --> 45:20.509
like the gayest thing
you could possibly do, okay?

45:20.593 --> 45:24.304
Look at me. Looks are not
important. Really look at me.

45:24.430 --> 45:27.349
I am ugly as fuck
by traditional standards

45:27.433 --> 45:29.851
but I get with women.

45:29.936 --> 45:32.062
Aren't you curious
as to how that's possible?

45:32.146 --> 45:34.356
I am not ugly as fuck.

45:34.440 --> 45:36.233
I didn't say you were
ugly as...

45:36.317 --> 45:37.776
Well, you implied it.
Okay.

45:37.860 --> 45:40.445
It doesn't matter if you're ugly
as fuck or you're ugly as shit.

45:40.530 --> 45:43.615
It's about talking to women,
and I know how to do that

45:43.699 --> 45:47.077
because I observe,
because I am a novelist.

45:47.745 --> 45:49.621
What? You never
told me that before.

45:49.705 --> 45:52.499
That's because I am not
an arrogant prick, Andy.

45:52.625 --> 45:55.001
Okay? The problem
most men have is

45:55.336 --> 45:56.837
they don't know
how to talk to women.

45:56.921 --> 46:00.632
You know what my problem is?
I am not interesting.

46:00.758 --> 46:03.343
What am I supposed to say?
"I went to magic camp?"

46:03.719 --> 46:05.512
"I'm an accomplished
ventriloquist?"

46:05.596 --> 46:08.723
"I am a seventh-degree
imperial yo-yo master. "

46:09.851 --> 46:11.893
Do me, yo-yo master.

46:11.978 --> 46:15.772
I want you to do me,
'cause you're the yo-yo guy.

46:16.107 --> 46:17.315
Are you done? Listen.

46:17.400 --> 46:19.317
The problem
most men have is

46:19.402 --> 46:22.863
they just plain straight up have
no clue how to talk to women.

46:23.406 --> 46:26.324
Just ask questions, okay?
That's it.

46:26.492 --> 46:31.079
Because women do not care about what
you have to say at all anyway, you know.

46:31.163 --> 46:33.164
And all they want to do
is talk about themselves.

46:33.249 --> 46:34.958
So you're just gonna
let them do that.

46:35.042 --> 46:36.668
Okay? So remember.

46:36.752 --> 46:39.963
Questions, be cool,
and be kind of a dick.

46:40.047 --> 46:43.174
Here, be David Caruso
in Jade.

46:43.676 --> 46:45.927
Okay. I know exactly
what you're talking about.

46:46.012 --> 46:47.512
You do. That's good.

46:49.223 --> 46:50.640
There she is.

46:53.477 --> 46:55.186
Go plant that seed, man.

46:55.813 --> 46:57.564
Plant it with your finger.

47:09.785 --> 47:11.202
Can I help you?

47:13.247 --> 47:14.873
I don't know. Can you?

47:16.542 --> 47:18.543
Are you looking
for something?

47:19.879 --> 47:22.547
Is there something
I should be looking for?

47:26.844 --> 47:28.386
We have
a lot of books.

47:28.804 --> 47:31.890
So, maybe it depends
on what you like.

47:36.896 --> 47:38.396
What do you like?

47:38.648 --> 47:42.150
We have a great section of...

47:42.652 --> 47:44.110
do-it-yourself.

47:44.195 --> 47:46.571
Do you like to
"do it yourself"?

47:47.490 --> 47:49.658
Sometimes. I mean...

47:50.242 --> 47:53.787
if the mood strikes.

47:55.164 --> 47:57.332
How is the mood
striking you now?

48:04.173 --> 48:07.550
What's your name?

48:07.635 --> 48:09.719
I'm Beth.

48:12.431 --> 48:15.934
Andy.

48:18.604 --> 48:21.231
Don't tell on me, okay, Andy? I won't.

48:22.942 --> 48:25.276
Unless you want
to be told on...

48:26.112 --> 48:27.112
Beth.

48:29.949 --> 48:31.533
Wow. That totally worked!

48:31.617 --> 48:33.702
I literally said nothing.
And she found me fascinating.

48:33.786 --> 48:35.620
I would've thought
you were doing that for years.

48:35.705 --> 48:37.414
Should I have asked her out?
No. That's the key.

48:37.498 --> 48:38.915
You wait for it
to grow into a plant...

48:39.000 --> 48:40.500
and then you fuck the plant.

48:44.588 --> 48:45.630
Okay.

48:46.507 --> 48:47.757
This is easy.

48:48.592 --> 48:49.926
All right.

48:50.428 --> 48:53.054
Hello, Trish. How you
doing? What's going on?

48:54.682 --> 48:55.849
Good joke.

48:55.933 --> 48:57.684
This is a fun conversation.

48:57.768 --> 49:00.145
Just grow a backbone
and call her.

49:00.271 --> 49:02.856
She asked you to call her.
She wants you to call her.

49:10.031 --> 49:11.031
Hello.

49:11.532 --> 49:12.907
Hey, how you doing?

49:14.827 --> 49:16.661
How you doing?
I'm well.

49:17.079 --> 49:18.496
Who is this?

49:19.165 --> 49:22.333
This is James.
Jam es. Do I know you, Jam es?

49:23.794 --> 49:25.795
I was wondering whether
you had a few minutes...

49:25.880 --> 49:27.756
to talk about
a little laundry detergent.

49:27.840 --> 49:30.008
Are you a telemarketer, James?

49:30.217 --> 49:31.259
Yep.

49:31.343 --> 49:32.802
Are you at the top
of a tall building?

49:32.887 --> 49:35.138
Can you get to a roof quickly?
Jum p off!

49:35.222 --> 49:36.389
I mean, you people are sick.

49:36.474 --> 49:38.266
Get a real fucking job,
why don't you?

49:38.350 --> 49:39.893
Go shoot yourself
in the fucking head.

49:39.977 --> 49:42.771
Hey, why don't you just, you
know, get a knife and run into it?

49:42.855 --> 49:44.272
Why don't you do that, huh?

49:44.356 --> 49:45.648
Okay.
I'll see you later, Jam es.

49:45.691 --> 49:49.027
Nice to talk to you. Fuck
your m other, okay? Bye-bye.

49:50.780 --> 49:51.780
Oh.

49:55.076 --> 49:57.452
Hey, man.
Got a big box of porn for you.

49:59.121 --> 50:01.456
Can I come in?
Yeah.

50:03.459 --> 50:05.376
Sweet video game chair.

50:09.298 --> 50:10.590
So what's in the box?

50:10.674 --> 50:13.051
It's my personal collection
of erotica.

50:13.385 --> 50:14.469
I want to give it to you.

50:14.553 --> 50:17.472
I think there might be a few tapes
in there that just might open up...

50:17.556 --> 50:19.099
Pandora's box of love.

50:19.183 --> 50:20.183
Okay.

50:20.267 --> 50:23.061
Amy and I, we used to
watch Harry Twatter...

50:23.187 --> 50:24.646
and we'd put it on
the television...

50:24.730 --> 50:26.648
and then act it out
as it was going on...

50:26.732 --> 50:28.399
and it was...

50:30.402 --> 50:31.945
She's adorable.

50:32.947 --> 50:34.322
Fucking bitch.

50:34.406 --> 50:36.407
Well, you know, this is
really gracious and kind...

50:36.492 --> 50:37.659
and generous and everything.

50:37.743 --> 50:40.453
But I just don't want a big
box of porn in my apartment.

50:40.538 --> 50:42.956
There's some really
great stuff in here.

50:43.040 --> 50:45.416
Really great movies in here,
man.

50:45.668 --> 50:47.168
Hey, did you ever see
School of Rock?

50:47.253 --> 50:48.711
Yeah.
Well, this is...

50:48.796 --> 50:50.421
It's called School of...

50:50.756 --> 50:51.923
You know...

50:52.216 --> 50:55.593
That's nice.
But it stars Jack Black Cock.

50:56.428 --> 50:57.637
That makes sense.

50:57.721 --> 50:59.514
Dude, here it is.

50:59.598 --> 51:02.183
Boner Jams '03.
It's a mixed tape I made.

51:02.268 --> 51:06.354
All these great scenes that I was
really into in the summer of 2003.

51:06.647 --> 51:09.399
I think you'd really dig it.
Yeah. Now I can see that.

51:09.483 --> 51:11.025
This is...

51:11.277 --> 51:12.694
Everybody Loves Raym ond.

51:12.778 --> 51:14.195
That's probably
not supposed to be...

51:14.280 --> 51:16.072
This is a good show.
I just tape it sometimes.

51:16.157 --> 51:18.199
Well, I don't think
you understand something, Dave.

51:18.284 --> 51:22.745
I don't want this stuff, okay?
Because I don't do that, that much.

51:22.830 --> 51:24.789
What, masturbate?
Yeah.

51:25.916 --> 51:28.251
Dude, I've jacked it twice
since I've been here.

51:28.335 --> 51:31.421
Are you kidding me? Why not?
It's not a hobby of mine.

51:31.505 --> 51:33.840
Well, then, that's the
only hobby you don't have.

51:33.924 --> 51:36.301
No, seriously, I just don't
feel comfortable talking about...

51:36.385 --> 51:37.468
You need to.
You're wound up.

51:37.553 --> 51:39.137
You're like one of these
action figures...

51:39.221 --> 51:40.930
all hermetically sealed
in your box.

51:41.015 --> 51:43.391
You gotta play with...
Don't!

51:43.475 --> 51:44.559
Don't take it out!

51:44.643 --> 51:47.270
I'm sorry.
You know what, it's just...

51:47.396 --> 51:50.064
It loses its value if you
take it out of its packaging.

51:50.149 --> 51:53.276
I'm just saying, let it out. Give
it some air, man. Play with it.

51:53.360 --> 51:56.029
Take your porn with you.
I'm not taking it.

51:56.113 --> 51:57.739
Take your box-o-porn.

51:57.823 --> 52:00.658
It's my gift to you.
No. I don't want it.

52:00.910 --> 52:02.076
David, it's not...

52:02.161 --> 52:03.203
Andy, for the last time...

52:03.287 --> 52:05.121
I don't want your giant box
of pornography.

52:05.206 --> 52:07.498
No, no, no!
Come on, man.

52:07.791 --> 52:09.083
So uncool.

52:09.668 --> 52:10.877
Uncool?

52:11.921 --> 52:15.715
Uncool is trying to give an
honest man a big box of porn, Andy.

52:16.550 --> 52:18.885
For the last time,
I don't want to watch

52:18.969 --> 52:20.637
School of Cock with you.

53:30.708 --> 53:32.625
It's nothing official.

53:33.585 --> 53:36.587
Just a little token
of m y appreciation.

53:57.484 --> 54:00.737
Hi, Andy.
I'm gonna talk dirty to you.

54:00.821 --> 54:05.158
I want to have
lots of sexy sex with you.

54:05.326 --> 54:09.370
I want to touch
your big, fat noodle

54:09.496 --> 54:13.333
'cause I want to have
naughty intercourse with you.

54:13.584 --> 54:17.545
I want you to put your penis
on, I mean, in me, Andy.

54:17.838 --> 54:21.257
I want to do lots of,
lots of sexy,

54:21.342 --> 54:24.010
hot things with you. Shit.

54:24.803 --> 54:27.889
This really isn't working,
Andy. I don't know what to say

54:27.973 --> 54:29.390
because I am you.

54:31.518 --> 54:32.852
Okay. New tape.

54:35.147 --> 54:37.940
Nothing is ever good enough
and it's always our fault.

54:38.025 --> 54:39.901
Hey, you can't speak
to your m other like that.

54:39.985 --> 54:41.861
You do.
She's not m y m other.

54:46.867 --> 54:49.202
I heard Dave gave you
the box of porn.

54:49.536 --> 54:50.620
Yeah, he did.

54:52.039 --> 54:53.956
You ever watch, like,
Primetime Live

54:54.041 --> 54:56.084
when they take a black light
into a hotel room

54:56.168 --> 54:58.669
and show you all the semen
all over the bedspread?

54:59.254 --> 55:00.254
Yeah.

55:00.881 --> 55:03.049
You blind someone
with that box.

55:03.634 --> 55:05.468
Could see that thing
from space.

55:09.014 --> 55:11.599
This right here, you looking at
the Bentley of big screen TVs.

55:11.683 --> 55:14.018
I'm talking about, this is the
Rolls-Royce of big screen...

55:15.646 --> 55:18.064
Sometimes, I think these
butterflies are in here.

55:18.565 --> 55:20.483
I think he might be
fooling us all, though.

55:20.567 --> 55:21.609
Really?

55:21.693 --> 55:23.778
I actually think he might be,
like, some genius

55:23.862 --> 55:25.947
and this is like
some big, like, hilarious...

55:26.031 --> 55:28.991
Like he's bored at work and he
just wanted to kick up some shit,

55:29.076 --> 55:30.451
so he told us all
he's a virgin.

55:30.536 --> 55:32.620
You're seeing that a lot
of stuff that's not there.

55:32.704 --> 55:34.664
You're just projecting
all over him.

55:34.873 --> 55:36.416
He might be an idiot savant

55:36.500 --> 55:39.502
but he's not, like,
clever enough to go that deep.

55:39.586 --> 55:40.920
But he's got a great body.

55:41.004 --> 55:43.339
Would you fuck him?
In a New York minute.

55:43.424 --> 55:45.049
You would fuck him?
Absolutely.

55:47.344 --> 55:49.137
Hey, Andy, what are you doing
for lunch?

55:49.596 --> 55:51.764
I don't know.
I have a turkey sandwich.

55:51.849 --> 55:54.684
We're gonna go around the corner.
I think you should come with us.

55:54.768 --> 55:57.562
There's this great place.
A lot of cute girls.

55:57.938 --> 55:59.439
I don't know. Okay.

56:00.357 --> 56:02.275
We brought you a shirt.

56:02.693 --> 56:04.485
This place is pretty fancy.

56:05.779 --> 56:06.821
Something going on?

56:06.905 --> 56:08.739
Hey, who's ready
to have some fun?

56:10.784 --> 56:12.201
Hey, guys...

56:13.620 --> 56:16.080
No, don't ignore me.
I know what this is.

56:16.165 --> 56:18.666
Within one hour,
you'll each have 20 dates.

56:18.792 --> 56:22.128
Don't... Please don't do this.
I saw this on Primetime Live.

56:22.254 --> 56:23.963
All right, ninja master.

56:24.381 --> 56:26.382
We've given you all the advice
we have to give.

56:26.467 --> 56:27.633
Now you gonna put it
in action.

56:27.718 --> 56:29.677
Advice? You guys all
gave me different advice.

56:29.761 --> 56:31.637
He thinks you're a pothead.
I am.

56:31.805 --> 56:34.891
Dude. Hey, partner.
What are you whining about?

56:34.975 --> 56:37.101
You asked for this shit.
No, I didn't.

56:37.186 --> 56:39.020
Will you just quit whining
like a bitch?

56:39.104 --> 56:41.606
I'm not whining like a bitch.
You are whining like a bitch.

56:41.690 --> 56:44.692
And you about to cram like 10
years of pimpage into one day.

56:44.776 --> 56:47.653
I don't want to cram pimpage.
Partner, after that

56:48.071 --> 56:49.739
you on my level. Come on.

56:49.865 --> 56:52.325
Just ask questions.
This is a bad idea.

56:55.329 --> 56:56.662
Hi.
Hi. How are you?

56:56.747 --> 56:57.997
I'm fine.

56:59.166 --> 57:00.333
Are you fine?

57:01.168 --> 57:02.168
Yeah.

57:03.003 --> 57:04.670
You're fine then?

57:05.339 --> 57:08.508
Are you fucking retarded? What
the hell's the matter with you?

57:08.842 --> 57:10.384
Do you want me to be
fucking retarded?

57:11.553 --> 57:13.930
When I look into the eyes of
the children and the parents

57:14.014 --> 57:15.431
and they are smiling
and saying,

57:15.516 --> 57:17.767
"Thank you, Dr. Montalban,
you saved my child",

57:17.851 --> 57:18.935
it was worth it.

57:21.813 --> 57:22.939
Amy,

57:23.607 --> 57:25.733
what are you doing here?
David.

57:27.110 --> 57:29.445
And you are Gina?
Gina.

57:29.530 --> 57:31.239
Hey, what's up?
Nothing.

57:31.365 --> 57:33.950
Look, I'm going to be
real honest with you.

57:34.034 --> 57:36.494
It's been a long time
since I've been with a man.

57:36.578 --> 57:39.247
Spent a lot of time
with the ladies.

57:39.331 --> 57:41.749
Looking to get back up
on that pogo stick.

57:41.833 --> 57:43.793
You know what I'm saying?
Excuse me.

57:43.877 --> 57:47.797
Remember that time when we made
love and you cried in my arms?

57:47.881 --> 57:50.299
Please don't reminisce about
the times we fucked, please.

57:50.384 --> 57:52.260
It's so creepy.
Let's go to Paris.

57:52.344 --> 57:55.137
I want to take you underneath the
Eiffel Tower and make love to you.

57:55.222 --> 57:56.472
Cut it out.
Cut what out?

57:56.557 --> 57:59.141
This go to Paris! We've been
broken up for like two years, man.

57:59.226 --> 58:00.643
I don't want to
date you anymore.

58:00.727 --> 58:02.311
You're a whore.
I am not a whore.

58:02.396 --> 58:04.021
I just didn't like you.

58:04.106 --> 58:05.231
This is so us.

58:07.484 --> 58:09.068
Psycho talk.
What?

58:09.152 --> 58:10.987
You're a good-looking man.
Thank you.

58:11.071 --> 58:13.447
Very pretty.
Real soft, delicate features.

58:13.532 --> 58:15.992
You're real feminine, you
know, which is good for me

58:16.076 --> 58:18.744
because that would be
a simple sort of transition.

58:18.829 --> 58:19.996
You know what I'm saying?

58:20.080 --> 58:23.249
Maybe throw a little rouge
on you, tuck your sac back.

58:23.333 --> 58:24.875
You game?
No.

58:26.044 --> 58:29.755
You need to stop fucking
around with my friend, okay?

58:29.840 --> 58:32.675
Because you're giving him hope,
and it's driving the man crazy.

58:32.759 --> 58:35.845
I moved, I changed my e-mail
address, my phone number.

58:35.929 --> 58:37.305
He's practically
stalking me.

58:37.389 --> 58:39.807
Well, I didn't know all that.
So, I'm sorry.

58:41.101 --> 58:42.184
I love Minnesota.

58:42.269 --> 58:44.854
I grew up in a town
outside of Minneapolis

58:44.938 --> 58:47.815
with a population of, like,
500 people. Really small.

58:47.899 --> 58:50.151
Yeah, it's like
the Land of a Thousand Lakes.

58:50.235 --> 58:52.987
What about you? You're used
to, like, a really big city.

58:53.113 --> 58:55.323
Really... God, yes.

58:56.450 --> 58:59.785
The town that I grew up in
was really small. I mean,

58:59.911 --> 59:02.747
you know, it was just so safe.
There was no crime.

59:02.831 --> 59:06.042
I mean, a girl could just walk
from one end of town to the other

59:06.126 --> 59:08.961
and just, you know,
feel completely safe.

59:12.132 --> 59:13.424
You suppose he's had enough?

59:13.508 --> 59:15.968
Spank bank has
once again been filled.

59:16.845 --> 59:18.387
I'll tell you
who's the hottest.

59:18.472 --> 59:21.557
You're gonna think I'm crazy.
Let me tell you. Gina.

59:21.975 --> 59:24.977
Can't get va-Gina out of
my head. Va-Gina all week.

59:34.863 --> 59:36.238
You know what's a fun game?
Huh?

59:36.323 --> 59:38.240
You take three
Excedrin PMs...

59:38.325 --> 59:41.035
and you see if you could whack
off before you fall asleep.

59:42.996 --> 59:45.539
You always win is the
best part about the game.

59:48.335 --> 59:50.211
Are you Andy?
Yeah.

59:50.295 --> 59:51.879
Is this yours?
Did you write this stuff?

59:51.963 --> 59:54.632
My girlfriend, Jill, found
your speed-dating card.

59:55.384 --> 59:56.676
Yeah, right.

59:56.760 --> 59:58.886
God, I've been looking
for that speed-dating card.

59:58.970 --> 01:00:00.763
Thank you so much
for bringing it to me.

01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:02.973
So, you actually wrote
that one girl looked like...

01:00:03.058 --> 01:00:04.934
she was
"hurting for a squirting"?

01:00:05.227 --> 01:00:08.020
Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Hurting for
a squirting, I wrote that.

01:00:08.105 --> 01:00:10.439
So you wrote
"ho fo show. "

01:00:11.233 --> 01:00:13.734
Yeah, I remember that girl.
She was a ho.

01:00:14.403 --> 01:00:15.611
Fo show.

01:00:15.821 --> 01:00:17.863
Let me show you
how this device works.

01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:19.657
Right, I'm just looking
for a cordless phone.

01:00:19.741 --> 01:00:22.451
Yup, it's great. You can do
anything, make video diaries...

01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:26.163
Hey, Amy, how's it going?
How you feeling? I'm great.

01:00:26.373 --> 01:00:28.999
I feel fantastic
since we broke up.

01:00:29.543 --> 01:00:31.168
I feel awesome!

01:00:31.253 --> 01:00:33.879
Can you just show me the department
where there would be phones?

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:36.132
How have you been?
What's been going on...

01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:38.259
I bet... Hey, have you been
doing a lot of this?

01:00:40.595 --> 01:00:41.929
Sir, please, sir.

01:00:42.013 --> 01:00:43.472
You are never gonna
meet anybody...

01:00:43.557 --> 01:00:46.183
with that kind of mentality about
women, you sick son of a bitch.

01:00:46.268 --> 01:00:48.018
Who the fuck are you
to put me on trial?

01:00:48.103 --> 01:00:49.729
I've never even met you.

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:52.022
So why don't you
back the shit off, all right?

01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:54.108
And stop with the inquisition.

01:00:54.234 --> 01:00:55.484
That's how you talk?

01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:57.403
You know what,
I don't have to answer to you.

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:59.029
You ain't my bitch.

01:00:59.114 --> 01:01:00.656
Know what I saying?

01:01:00.741 --> 01:01:03.033
So, shit, man. Fuck it.

01:01:03.118 --> 01:01:05.161
You shouldn't even be
hanging out with this pervert.

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:07.371
I don't hang out with him.
I work with him and that's it.

01:01:07.456 --> 01:01:09.123
I tried to introduce him
to a few nice people...

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:10.291
he made a fool of himself.

01:01:10.375 --> 01:01:12.042
I don't mess with him, baby.
That's not me.

01:01:12.127 --> 01:01:14.336
You should keep your ho
on a leash.

01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:16.046
Bro, I can't let you...
Hey.

01:01:16.131 --> 01:01:18.299
I can't let you be talking
to my woman like that, dawg.

01:01:18.383 --> 01:01:20.551
Know what I'm saying?
Bitch is running wild, man.

01:01:20.635 --> 01:01:23.846
You miss that ass?
That's the ass of a free man.

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:26.265
That ass is going out tonight,
maybe to a club.

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:27.933
Maybe to a night club.

01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:29.435
Hey, Andy...

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:31.854
take a look at your pal.
Oh, my God.

01:01:31.938 --> 01:01:34.482
Yeah, he's performing
a public colonoscopy.

01:01:34.566 --> 01:01:35.941
Isn't that sweet?

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:37.526
I'm gonna send
David home for the day...

01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:38.736
and you're gonna
fill in for him.

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:40.529
What? Selling things?
You got that right.

01:01:40.614 --> 01:01:41.822
I don't think
that's a good idea.

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:43.407
And you're gonna have to
talk to people, too.

01:01:43.492 --> 01:01:45.117
I know that's a frightening
concept to you...

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:46.410
but I think you can handle it.

01:01:46.495 --> 01:01:48.245
So get out there
and start selling some shit.

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:49.663
...thing for Amy.

01:01:49.998 --> 01:01:51.415
Hold it.
Check it out.

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:52.917
I miss her.

01:01:55.796 --> 01:01:57.755
Dude, the floor's
the ultimate aphrodisiac.

01:01:57.839 --> 01:01:59.590
All you got to do
is go make your pick now.

01:01:59.674 --> 01:02:02.051
Come on, man.
Okay.

01:02:02.844 --> 01:02:04.804
And you could act
a little enthused about it.

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:06.013
Yeah.

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:10.601
That's right. That's right.
Gazelle in the pink top.

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:13.437
Oh, shit.
Hi.

01:02:13.522 --> 01:02:15.606
Looks like you're
checking out digital cameras.

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:17.608
You know what, he ain't going
to do it willingly.

01:02:17.692 --> 01:02:20.486
No. We need to, like, really
facilitate things a bit more.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:22.154
Yo, Andy.
Yeah.

01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:23.697
What's up, dude?
This is Jay, man.

01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:25.032
Hey, Jay.

01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:26.575
I am throwing a party tonight.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.369
It's gonna be real mellow,
just chilled up.

01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:29.829
Now, you really
need to be there.

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:32.456
It's gonna be
really, really colorful.

01:02:32.707 --> 01:02:34.041
Are you free?

01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:35.960
Yeah, I think so.

01:02:36.044 --> 01:02:38.420
That was a joke, m an.
I know you're free.

01:02:38.713 --> 01:02:40.089
I'm okay.
Gotta go, man.

01:02:40.173 --> 01:02:41.257
All right, bye.

01:02:44.052 --> 01:02:46.178
So, tell me, Montel...

01:02:46.555 --> 01:02:49.598
why weren't we invited to the
party? What are we, Al-Qaeda?

01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:50.766
No, hold up.

01:02:50.851 --> 01:02:53.018
No, no. It's not that
kind of party, y'all.

01:02:53.103 --> 01:02:55.145
You're not coming to our
fucking party either, okay?

01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:56.272
Fuck you, okay?

01:02:56.356 --> 01:02:58.107
First of all,
it ain't that kind of party.

01:02:58.191 --> 01:03:00.067
Go fuck a goat.
Yeah.

01:03:00.193 --> 01:03:01.986
Why you always telling me
to fuck a goat, man?

01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:03.112
Fuck a goat!

01:03:19.671 --> 01:03:24.258
Hello?

01:03:26.094 --> 01:03:27.261
Hello.

01:03:28.889 --> 01:03:30.598
Hello. Hi.

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:34.101
Are you here for Jay's party?
Yes.

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:36.103
I am Jay's party.

01:03:37.939 --> 01:03:41.025
You know what, hiring a transvestite
prostitute isn't helping me, man.

01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:43.360
What? Ain't nobody hired
no damn transvestite.

01:03:43.445 --> 01:03:44.486
What are you talking about?

01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:46.363
She was really nice,
incidentally.

01:03:46.448 --> 01:03:48.198
If that sister
was a transvestite...

01:03:48.283 --> 01:03:50.367
that was the Mona Lisa
of transvestites.

01:03:50.452 --> 01:03:52.328
You got a hummer
from the tranny, didn't you?

01:03:52.412 --> 01:03:55.706
You know, aren't we owed one now?
'Cause technically we paid her.

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:57.124
She had a dick, man.

01:03:57.208 --> 01:03:58.876
Do you guys even like me?

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:02.379
Or is this some sort of cruel
joke that you're all in on?

01:04:02.464 --> 01:04:04.757
Because I'm not a freak.
I'm a good person.

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:08.344
I always thought that Matt Damon
was like a Streisand, but...

01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:10.930
I think that he's rocking
the shit in this one.

01:04:11.014 --> 01:04:12.723
Shut up, Dave!

01:04:12.807 --> 01:04:16.685
Hold up. Let's just chill on
the aggression for a minute.

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:21.190
Look at him.
He is such a bad ass.

01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:24.193
He looks
just like Luke Wilson.

01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:25.277
Mmm-hmm.

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:27.071
So you saying
she was definitely a man?

01:04:27.155 --> 01:04:28.197
Yes.

01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:30.366
Okay, well, how do you know
that she was a man?

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:33.369
Because her hands were
as big as André the Giant's.

01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:36.497
And she had an Adam's apple
as big as her balls.

01:04:37.165 --> 01:04:38.666
So you have no proof.

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:40.709
You know what?
Just leave me alone.

01:04:40.794 --> 01:04:42.836
Just stay away from me.
Or I'm gonna tell Paula...

01:04:42.921 --> 01:04:44.838
that you're all stealing
the recordable CDs.

01:04:45.507 --> 01:04:48.175
Come on. That's like
we were paid to do it.

01:04:48.259 --> 01:04:50.302
We did this
'cause we're your friends...

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:53.138
and we didn't think you have
the balls to do it yourself.

01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:54.515
Really?
Yeah.

01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:56.058
Okay, watch this.

01:04:56.267 --> 01:04:57.726
Yo, Andy,
it's just CDs, man.

01:04:57.811 --> 01:04:59.687
That's a third strike
for me, dawg.

01:05:23.294 --> 01:05:24.294
Hi.

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:27.256
Andy. Hi.
Right, yeah.

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:29.049
You remember my name.
I did.

01:05:29.175 --> 01:05:31.635
How you doing? I'm
great. I like your store.

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:34.304
That's good, yeah. If you
have time, look around. It's...

01:05:34.389 --> 01:05:35.472
Okay.

01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:37.224
How's business been?

01:05:37.308 --> 01:05:40.269
You know, it's coming along.
I mean, it takes a while.

01:05:40.353 --> 01:05:43.397
Do you want to go out sometime? Yes.

01:05:43.857 --> 01:05:46.316
Yes, I would like that.
That would be great.

01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:50.154
I think I'm maybe free this
weekend, if that's okay.

01:05:50.238 --> 01:05:53.032
Or you could call me tomorrow
and we can just firm it up.

01:05:53.116 --> 01:05:54.658
Okay. Great.
Great.

01:05:54.743 --> 01:05:58.328
Okay, so I'll call you,
and yeah, that'll be good.

01:05:58.413 --> 01:05:59.872
How you doing?
Congratulations.

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:01.874
Okay, so I'll... Yeah.

01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:03.500
Can I help you?

01:06:03.585 --> 01:06:06.086
Yeah, these are wonderful.
I'll take these.

01:06:06.254 --> 01:06:09.923
Thanks, they are. They're great.
The goldfish just crack me up.

01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:11.050
Funny.

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:12.217
Yeah, they are.
Yeah.

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:13.510
Yeah.
They're cute.

01:06:13.595 --> 01:06:16.764
I don't actually sell anything
here. I just sell them on eBay.

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:18.682
I don't get it.

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:19.933
Okay.

01:06:20.101 --> 01:06:23.020
Can you help me?
No, you're on your own here.

01:06:23.104 --> 01:06:26.273
Good luck to you, and to you.
And I'll give you a call.

01:06:26.357 --> 01:06:29.359
Great. Nice to see you.
Great. Thanks for coming in.

01:06:29.944 --> 01:06:30.944
Bye.

01:06:31.696 --> 01:06:33.614
So, I guess I'll just
give you some money...

01:06:33.698 --> 01:06:36.200
and you can give me
these shoes and...

01:06:36.284 --> 01:06:38.994
You know,
I know it seems so strange...

01:06:39.079 --> 01:06:41.747
Yes. I'd just rather buy them
from you straight up.

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:43.749
Yeah, I know. I wish it
could be that easy, but...

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:47.044
I wish, too, but you're making
it extremely difficult for me.

01:06:47.128 --> 01:06:49.296
I'm just trying to get these
shoes back to my house...

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:50.631
so I can wear them.

01:06:51.091 --> 01:06:52.633
I got a corpse in m y way.

01:06:52.717 --> 01:06:53.884
Look out. Just kill it.

01:06:53.968 --> 01:06:56.970
That's just so not fair
that you have blades and...

01:06:57.138 --> 01:06:58.972
I'm telling you, man,
I feel great.

01:06:59.057 --> 01:07:01.058
I'm so... It's like a
weight has been lifted.

01:07:01.142 --> 01:07:04.728
Celibacy is the way to go, man.
Andy had it right, you know?

01:07:04.813 --> 01:07:06.688
Look at him. He looks
younger than all of us...

01:07:06.773 --> 01:07:08.023
but he's 10 years older.

01:07:08.108 --> 01:07:10.609
Why? Because he's never had
a relationship.

01:07:10.902 --> 01:07:13.529
No she-devil sucked
his life force out yet.

01:07:29.921 --> 01:07:32.256
Hello?
Hey. Hi. Hello.

01:07:32.632 --> 01:07:33.674
Is this Trish?

01:07:34.634 --> 01:07:36.802
Who's calling, please?
This is Andy.

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:39.096
Hi, Andy.
Hi, how you doing?

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:42.141
I'm good. How're you doing?
I'm doing great.

01:07:42.934 --> 01:07:44.184
So you're gay, now?

01:07:44.269 --> 01:07:46.186
No, I'm not gay.
I'm just celibate.

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:48.897
I think...
I mean, that sounds gay.

01:07:48.982 --> 01:07:51.859
I just want you to know that
this is the first conversation...

01:07:51.943 --> 01:07:55.362
of three conversations
that leads to you being gay.

01:07:55.822 --> 01:07:58.407
There's this and then in a
year it's like, "You know...

01:07:58.491 --> 01:08:01.618
"I'm kind of going to wanna get back
out there, but I think I like guys. "

01:08:01.703 --> 01:08:04.538
And then there's the big,
"I'm a gay guy now. "

01:08:04.831 --> 01:08:07.249
You're gay for saying that.
I'm gay for saying that?

01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:09.960
You know how I know you're gay?
How? How do you know I'm gay?

01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:12.504
'Cause you macraméd yourself
a pair of jean shorts.

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:13.672
You know how I know
you're gay?

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:15.799
You just told me you're not
sleeping with women anymore.

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:17.466
You know how I know you're gay? How?

01:08:17.551 --> 01:08:20.595
'Cause you're gay and you can
tell who other gay people are?

01:08:20.721 --> 01:08:22.221
Do you know how I know you're gay? How?

01:08:22.307 --> 01:08:23.765
You like Coldplay.

01:08:24.475 --> 01:08:25.809
You're dead.

01:08:27.228 --> 01:08:28.270
Come on.

01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:30.314
Leave my torso alone
at least.

01:08:31.191 --> 01:08:32.608
I also wanted to call...

01:08:32.692 --> 01:08:35.402
and see what night
you might want to go out.

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:37.362
I'm actually free tonight.

01:08:39.365 --> 01:08:42.743
Okay. Now, I was thinking maybe
this weekend, but that's good. Okay.

01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:43.827
Great.

01:08:43.912 --> 01:08:45.912
Okay, what time
do you want to pick me up?

01:08:47.415 --> 01:08:48.749
Let's see.

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:53.127
That's actually kind of a
problem because I ride a bike.

01:08:53.421 --> 01:08:54.796
That's cool.
Are you kidding m e?

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:56.673
I love getting on the back
of a motorcycle.

01:08:56.758 --> 01:08:59.426
My boyfriend in college
drove a motorcycle.

01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:01.303
So, I mean, I'm cool.

01:09:01.386 --> 01:09:05.474
Yeah, I bet that was cool.
I ride a bicycle.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.185
You know how I know
that you're gay?

01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:09.353
How?

01:09:09.437 --> 01:09:11.688
You like the movie
Maid in Manhattan.

01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:13.273
You know how I know you're gay? How?

01:09:13.358 --> 01:09:16.526
I saw you make a spinach dip in
a loaf of sourdough bread once.

01:09:16.611 --> 01:09:18.362
You know how I know you're gay? How?

01:09:18.446 --> 01:09:21.156
You have a rainbow bumper
sticker on your car that says:

01:09:21.241 --> 01:09:23.450
"I love it
when balls are in my face. "

01:09:23.533 --> 01:09:24.618
That's gay?

01:09:24.702 --> 01:09:26.078
God damn it!

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:29.081
I'm ripping your head off
right now. It's off.

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:31.667
And now I'm throwing it
at your body.

01:09:32.585 --> 01:09:33.627
Fuck you!

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:36.129
You guys...

01:09:36.923 --> 01:09:39.091
she's picking me up
in an hour.

01:09:40.134 --> 01:09:41.760
Oh, drag, dude.

01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:44.554
She's picking you up from here? Yeah.

01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:46.180
That's fucked up, man.

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:47.890
Why?
Why?

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:52.020
Seriously. I mean,
look at this place, man.

01:09:52.563 --> 01:09:55.816
You gotta see this through
the eyes of a woman, you know?

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:58.235
What is she going to think
when she comes in here? Look.

01:09:58.319 --> 01:10:00.737
He's got a billion toys.
So what?

01:10:00.822 --> 01:10:03.573
And more video games
than a teenaged Asian kid.

01:10:03.658 --> 01:10:05.200
It's all right.

01:10:05.827 --> 01:10:08.662
Is that the
Six Million Dollar Man's boss?

01:10:08.997 --> 01:10:10.122
It's Oscar Goldman.

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:12.416
Why do you have that?
That's worth a lot of money.

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.459
That's much more valuable
than Steve Austin.

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:18.797
Well, that may be the case. But
none of this shit is sexy, okay?

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.590
I'm not
trying to be sexy, man.

01:10:20.675 --> 01:10:22.217
I mean, seriously, Asia?

01:10:22.343 --> 01:10:24.136
You framed an Asia poster?

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.221
How hard did the people
at the frame store laugh...

01:10:26.306 --> 01:10:28.307
when you brought this in?
They did not laugh at me.

01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:30.267
Know why you're gay?
Because you like Asia.

01:10:30.351 --> 01:10:31.601
You guys cool it
with the gay.

01:10:31.686 --> 01:10:33.520
You know, she's on her way
over here, okay?

01:10:33.604 --> 01:10:35.314
First, you relax, okay?

01:10:35.398 --> 01:10:38.692
Just stop calming me down
and tell me what I should do.

01:10:38.776 --> 01:10:40.944
Okay, we just take everything
that's embarrassing...

01:10:41.029 --> 01:10:42.112
and we move it out of here.

01:10:42.196 --> 01:10:44.197
So it doesn't look like
you live in Neverland Ranch.

01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:52.831
Hi.
Hi. How are you?

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:53.957
Good.

01:10:54.042 --> 01:10:56.001
So, you wanna head out?

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:57.961
Did you just
move in or something?

01:10:58.046 --> 01:11:00.297
No. Actually I'm getting
new carpet in.

01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:02.758
I'm having carpet
put in tomorrow, so...

01:11:04.218 --> 01:11:05.469
Well, you know.
Yeah.

01:11:05.553 --> 01:11:07.220
Okay.
Looks good with the floors.

01:11:07.305 --> 01:11:08.722
Yeah.
All right.

01:11:09.057 --> 01:11:10.515
I should tear up
the hard wood...

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.726
and see if there's
carpet underneath.

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.686
That's never the case.

01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:19.649
This is gonna be fun.
Yes.

01:11:19.734 --> 01:11:21.651
You know, I drive by
this place every day.

01:11:21.736 --> 01:11:23.445
I've never been in
before.

01:11:24.072 --> 01:11:25.322
I'm glad you came.

01:11:25.406 --> 01:11:28.658
You know, I never really go
out with nice guys like you.

01:11:29.577 --> 01:11:32.454
I think I've avoided nice guys
like you my whole life...

01:11:32.538 --> 01:11:33.997
at my own peril.

01:11:35.875 --> 01:11:37.501
My last boyfriend
drank a lot.

01:11:37.585 --> 01:11:38.585
Mmm-hmm.

01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:40.170
And so...
This is just punch.

01:11:41.464 --> 01:11:43.256
No, it's okay.
A little bit's fine.

01:11:43.341 --> 01:11:45.592
Buddha punch.
I need some Buddha.

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:48.595
Excuse me, miss.
Could you gather your team...

01:11:48.679 --> 01:11:51.431
and sing happy birthday
for my daughter, please?

01:12:09.867 --> 01:12:12.577
That was so good. What? That
was great. Happy birthday.

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:14.621
It's your birthday, too?
No.

01:12:14.705 --> 01:12:16.790
It's his birthday, too.
No, no, no.

01:12:16.874 --> 01:12:19.459
Could you sing for him
and bring him a cake?

01:12:19.544 --> 01:12:21.044
Happy birthday.

01:12:35.143 --> 01:12:37.519
Thanks a lot.
Happy birthday, Andy.

01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:56.913
You really like kissing, don't you? Yes.

01:12:59.667 --> 01:13:00.917
I really do.

01:13:01.002 --> 01:13:02.752
Take off your pants,
okay?

01:13:04.297 --> 01:13:05.630
Okay.
Okay.

01:13:08.134 --> 01:13:10.469
Wow, this is really
gonna happen. Oh, yeah.

01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:12.012
Thank God.

01:13:13.431 --> 01:13:16.600
Okay, I'm taking off my pants. Yeah.

01:13:16.976 --> 01:13:18.560
Do you need some help?

01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:22.355
I think I almost got them.
It's hooked on my ankle.

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:24.524
Wow, that's...

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:27.903
Hey, wait.
Do you have protection?

01:13:27.987 --> 01:13:29.654
I don't like guns.

01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:34.117
That's funny.

01:13:34.202 --> 01:13:36.536
I have condoms
right here. Okay?

01:13:36.621 --> 01:13:38.455
Okay.
There's, you know...

01:13:38.539 --> 01:13:41.625
Check the expiration date because
they were from when I was married.

01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:44.503
And we didn't have sex that often.
That's why there are so many, okay?

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:45.712
Okay.

01:13:50.051 --> 01:13:51.426
I got them.

01:13:53.804 --> 01:13:55.430
How does this go?

01:13:55.932 --> 01:14:00.644
Okay. "Roll over the tip
and down onto the base. "

01:14:02.563 --> 01:14:04.105
Over the balls?

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:06.233
It doesn't say.

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:11.488
Do you mind
if I use your magnum?

01:14:12.657 --> 01:14:13.657
Yeah.

01:14:15.535 --> 01:14:17.494
Wow. You got to be kidding.

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:19.913
I am Aquaman.

01:14:21.916 --> 01:14:23.375
What is that?

01:14:41.435 --> 01:14:42.519
Mom?

01:14:43.688 --> 01:14:44.938
What's going on here?

01:14:45.022 --> 01:14:46.940
Who the hell are you?
It's Andy.

01:14:47.024 --> 01:14:48.066
Hi, I'm Andy.

01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:49.651
God! What are you doing?

01:14:49.735 --> 01:14:51.736
Marla, get the fuck
out of my room!

01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:52.862
You know what...

01:14:52.947 --> 01:14:55.490
I cannot believe that you're
allowed to have sex when I'm not!

01:14:55.575 --> 01:14:57.492
That is so unfair.
I'm gonna head out.

01:14:57.577 --> 01:14:58.577
You should go.

01:14:58.661 --> 01:15:01.621
Oh, Jesus! How many
times did you just do it?

01:15:01.706 --> 01:15:02.831
Oh, my God!

01:15:05.376 --> 01:15:06.835
I'm so sorry.

01:15:13.759 --> 01:15:15.677
Dude, teach me.

01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:26.980
Hotline.

01:15:27.064 --> 01:15:30.567
Hi, yes, I'm calling because
it's more than four hours

01:15:30.651 --> 01:15:33.695
and your ad said to call if
it's been more than four hours.

01:15:33.779 --> 01:15:35.697
How much of the medicine
have you taken, sir?

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:39.117
I haven't taken any,
but your ad said

01:15:39.201 --> 01:15:43.079
that if you've had an erection
for more than four hours, you call.

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:46.583
You're only supposed to call
if you've taken the m edicine.

01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:50.045
Okay. I'm sorry. I must
not have heard that part.

01:15:50.129 --> 01:15:52.589
Yes. If you haven't taken
the m edicine, you don't call.

01:15:52.673 --> 01:15:54.716
Right. I'm sorry. Right.

01:15:54.842 --> 01:15:57.052
So, there's nothing
you can do?

01:15:57.511 --> 01:15:59.554
I just don't wanna...
There's nothing I can do.

01:15:59.638 --> 01:16:00.722
I'm in Bom bay, India.

01:16:00.806 --> 01:16:03.558
Okay. No, not you personally.
I just don't want...

01:16:03.851 --> 01:16:05.727
I just don't want
to have an erection anymore.

01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:09.064
You know,
you could have sex.

01:16:09.190 --> 01:16:10.190
Okay. Yup.

01:16:10.858 --> 01:16:14.694
That's one thing people do
when they have an erection.

01:16:14.779 --> 01:16:17.322
Yeah, that's not an option.
I don't have sex.

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:19.741
Okay, well,
then you can m asturbate.

01:16:19.825 --> 01:16:21.493
I'd rather not masturbate.

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:24.537
If you'd like the erection to
go away, you can light a m atch,

01:16:24.622 --> 01:16:28.708
blow out the flame and put
the hot em ber on your wrist.

01:16:29.418 --> 01:16:31.461
And that will focus
the brain elsewhere

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:34.130
and you will lose your
erection. Really? That'd work?

01:16:34.215 --> 01:16:37.008
Take your finger
and flick your testicle

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:38.510
and if you do that
till it hurts

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:40.804
your erection will go away.
Okay, all right.

01:16:40.888 --> 01:16:42.263
It sounds unpleasant
and it is.

01:16:42.348 --> 01:16:44.057
It is a trick we use
in India.

01:16:44.141 --> 01:16:47.894
Okay, those are all good pieces
of advice. I really appreciate it.

01:16:47.978 --> 01:16:50.021
We appreciate your business.

01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:52.232
Oh, no.
We didn't get your business...

01:16:52.316 --> 01:16:55.777
No, not this time. I guess I didn't
need you this time. Thank you.

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:26.850
My goodness, Andy,
you are a terrific salesman.

01:17:26.934 --> 01:17:29.227
Thank you.
Gosh, you really got it down.

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:31.146
Thanks.
And your numbers are good.

01:17:31.230 --> 01:17:32.230
Thanks.

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:34.190
I'm going to put you out
on the floor full time.

01:17:34.275 --> 01:17:35.233
Really?
Yeah.

01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:36.317
Wow. Okay.

01:17:36.402 --> 01:17:38.570
Good. We're gonna get you a
blue shirt and tie, all right?

01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:39.696
Great. Thanks.

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:42.699
You know, Andy, I've been
thinking about your problem.

01:17:42.783 --> 01:17:44.951
I think I might have
a solution for you.

01:17:46.162 --> 01:17:49.247
You ever heard of the term
"fuck buddy"?

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.125
What?

01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:54.711
It's a special friend

01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:56.880
who you fuck.

01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.924
No, haven't heard that term.

01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:02.969
When I was a little girl,
I developed early.

01:18:03.637 --> 01:18:06.681
By the time I was 14, I had
this body you're looking at.

01:18:06.765 --> 01:18:09.851
Can you imagine that?
I don't want to, no.

01:18:10.436 --> 01:18:13.480
Well, needless to say,
a lot of male attention.

01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:14.731
Like men, yes.

01:18:14.815 --> 01:18:18.818
Especially from our
Guatemalan gardener, Javier.

01:18:18.986 --> 01:18:20.111
Okay.

01:18:20.488 --> 01:18:22.197
You know, Javier,

01:18:23.073 --> 01:18:27.869
before he made passionate yet
gentle love to me for the first time,

01:18:29.205 --> 01:18:33.333
he serenaded me with a beautiful
old Guatemalan love song.

01:18:33.417 --> 01:18:35.084
Really, that's...

01:18:35.461 --> 01:18:37.837
That sounds nice.

01:19:05.241 --> 01:19:06.324
Okay.

01:19:07.952 --> 01:19:09.202
My goodness.

01:19:09.495 --> 01:19:11.663
I think we better get
back to work. Yeah.

01:19:11.789 --> 01:19:14.123
Yeah, I better go back to work. Yeah.

01:19:14.208 --> 01:19:16.042
So, okay.
All right.

01:19:16.126 --> 01:19:17.961
So, you mull it over
and I'll talk to you soon.

01:19:18.087 --> 01:19:19.921
All right, I will. Thank you. Okay.

01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:28.012
What's up, dawg? What happened?
How was the date with Trish?

01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:30.390
It was a disaster.
Really?

01:19:30.474 --> 01:19:33.268
Yes. I've never been
more embarrassed in my life.

01:19:33.477 --> 01:19:35.520
Couldn't get the
condoms to work.

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:38.356
And one of them
exploded on my balls.

01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:40.441
And then her kid
walked in the room.

01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:41.526
Wait. Hold up.

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:43.027
She was hiding the kid
from you, dawg?

01:19:43.112 --> 01:19:44.445
You know what,
it doesn't matter

01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:46.864
because it was going downhill
straight from there.

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:49.117
Listen, you don't want
no baby-daddy drama.

01:19:49.201 --> 01:19:50.410
Trust me on this one,
all right?

01:19:50.494 --> 01:19:52.537
For all you know,
he in prison right now.

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:53.997
Let's say y'all
living together.

01:19:54.081 --> 01:19:57.041
Next thing you know, you the one
going on the 1 st and the 15th

01:19:57.126 --> 01:19:58.334
to pick up the
government check.

01:19:58.419 --> 01:20:00.503
What if he got boys
that's on the outside

01:20:00.588 --> 01:20:01.671
and they stalking you?

01:20:01.755 --> 01:20:03.631
You see what I'm saying?
You got to think, partner...

01:20:03.716 --> 01:20:05.383
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:07.927
Here's what you do.
You tell her you're a virgin.

01:20:08.012 --> 01:20:10.138
You test her
with this shit, okay?

01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:12.974
Here, tell me. Tell me. This
is how it's gonna go. Tell me.

01:20:13.058 --> 01:20:14.851
I'm a virgin.
Sweet.

01:20:15.352 --> 01:20:18.771
I like that because
you don't have chlamydia.

01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:22.734
And I know that,
and that shit is everywhere.

01:20:23.277 --> 01:20:25.069
What if she
laughs at me, though?

01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:27.322
Then you punch her in the
fucking head if she laughs.

01:20:27.406 --> 01:20:29.949
I'm not going to punch her in
the head. She's really sweet.

01:20:30.034 --> 01:20:33.578
No. I mean, you punch her in
her fucking head emotionally.

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:36.664
She's different. She's someone
I felt like I had

01:20:36.749 --> 01:20:38.082
a connection with.

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:41.419
All you trying to do right now
is bust off this first nut.

01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:44.005
You got a whole lot of semen
back up in you.

01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:45.214
I am going to tell her.

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:47.133
You should totally tell
her, man. I'm going to.

01:20:47.217 --> 01:20:49.427
'Cause I watched this movie
called Liar Liar

01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:52.180
and the message was,
"Don't lie. "

01:20:52.264 --> 01:20:53.931
And that was a smart movie.

01:20:54.016 --> 01:20:55.516
Yeah, that's the right thing.
Yeah.

01:20:56.268 --> 01:21:00.188
Really? All your girlfriends wanted
to have sex with virgins, too?

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:04.484
That's funny. I didn't even
know you girls talked like that.

01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:08.237
I think my first time
might be your best time, too.

01:21:09.073 --> 01:21:10.448
Well, I knew it.
You know what,

01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:13.618
I knew that you'd react
that way and I knew that,

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:18.373
you would want to lead me
through my first sexual encounter

01:21:18.666 --> 01:21:23.169
with all the compassion
and care that someone

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:25.046
would give to their soul mate.

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:27.006
Oh, my God. I'm in trouble.

01:21:30.302 --> 01:21:31.511
Hey, Andy.

01:21:32.179 --> 01:21:33.805
You watching Survivor tonight?

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:36.349
No, actually I'm going out
to dinner with somebody.

01:21:36.433 --> 01:21:37.433
Hi.

01:21:37.851 --> 01:21:38.893
This is her.

01:21:38.936 --> 01:21:40.978
Trish, this is Joe and Sara. Hi.

01:21:41.063 --> 01:21:42.355
Hi, Trish.
Hey.

01:21:42.439 --> 01:21:43.981
But tape it for me,
okay?

01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:45.692
Will do. All right.
Thanks.

01:21:45.818 --> 01:21:46.943
So long.
Bye-bye.

01:21:47.027 --> 01:21:48.695
See you later.
Have a good night.

01:21:48.779 --> 01:21:51.197
Yeah, my man's gonna
get it on tonight.

01:21:51.281 --> 01:21:52.240
Yes, sir.

01:21:52.324 --> 01:21:54.867
Yeah, and you better
get on me, too.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.036
What is wrong
with this woman?

01:21:57.121 --> 01:21:58.413
Mercy, mercy, mercy.

01:22:04.712 --> 01:22:06.379
I'm so sorry that happened
the other night.

01:22:06.463 --> 01:22:07.505
No, I'm sorry.

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:09.257
Oh, my God.
That was me.

01:22:09.341 --> 01:22:10.341
No.

01:22:11.051 --> 01:22:13.761
Let me... I have something
I want to tell you.

01:22:14.638 --> 01:22:16.597
Kind of hard to talk about.

01:22:17.558 --> 01:22:18.558
But...

01:22:19.309 --> 01:22:22.311
you know,
there are certain things...

01:22:22.646 --> 01:22:25.022
about who I am that...

01:22:25.524 --> 01:22:28.526
I'm sorry. I just have
to get this off my chest.

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:31.320
I am so sorry,
I didn't tell you I had kids.

01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:33.865
Yeah, what was that about?

01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:36.325
Gosh. You know,
that really surprised me.

01:22:39.163 --> 01:22:41.080
No, you should have
told me probably, but...

01:22:41.165 --> 01:22:42.165
I'm sorry. I know.

01:22:42.249 --> 01:22:44.333
What do I care
if you have a kid?

01:22:44.835 --> 01:22:46.502
Well, I have two kids.

01:22:47.337 --> 01:22:49.756
Wow. Okay.
How old are they?

01:22:50.758 --> 01:22:51.841
Six.

01:22:52.551 --> 01:22:53.801
Sixteen.

01:22:54.261 --> 01:22:55.636
Twenty-one.

01:22:56.513 --> 01:22:57.847
Forty-two.

01:22:58.724 --> 01:23:00.641
Fifty-six. How many kids
do you have?

01:23:00.726 --> 01:23:02.560
I have three.
Okay, three.

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:04.604
Yeah, and one of them has a kid.

01:23:04.688 --> 01:23:06.022
A one-year-old.

01:23:06.356 --> 01:23:08.065
That's cool. That's great.

01:23:10.068 --> 01:23:13.571
I'm really glad we're
doing this. Me, too.

01:23:17.951 --> 01:23:19.494
Listen, Andy...

01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:22.872
I don't want to send you running
for the hills or anything, but...

01:23:22.956 --> 01:23:27.668
I really feel like if we
decide to do this again, then...

01:23:29.797 --> 01:23:33.049
maybe we should hold off on
the physical part for a while.

01:23:34.927 --> 01:23:37.261
That is a fantastic idea.

01:23:38.055 --> 01:23:39.514
Why didn't I think of that?

01:23:39.598 --> 01:23:40.807
Really?
Totally.

01:23:40.891 --> 01:23:44.185
No sex?
No. Why do that?

01:23:44.269 --> 01:23:46.062
Because here's the thing.

01:23:46.230 --> 01:23:47.396
From personal experience...

01:23:47.481 --> 01:23:50.149
I found that sex can
really complicate things.

01:23:50.234 --> 01:23:53.319
And what we should be doing right
now is getting to know each other.

01:23:53.403 --> 01:23:54.403
Yeah.

01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:56.781
Well, I never thought
you'd go for it.

01:23:56.865 --> 01:23:58.241
I'm going for it.

01:23:58.325 --> 01:24:01.244
Well, that just
is a great, great notion.

01:24:02.204 --> 01:24:03.287
Are you serious?

01:24:03.372 --> 01:24:06.165
Look at my face.
Look at how serious I am.

01:24:06.458 --> 01:24:08.167
Can you see my nostrils?

01:24:08.252 --> 01:24:10.086
Yes.
That's serious.

01:24:10.295 --> 01:24:11.754
That's more angry.

01:24:12.214 --> 01:24:14.423
Yeah, you know what,
most guys would be saying:

01:24:14.508 --> 01:24:17.718
"Yeah," right now, but, like,
by the third date, it would be:

01:24:17.803 --> 01:24:21.347
"Hey, baby, I really need to
physically express how I feel"...

01:24:21.431 --> 01:24:23.766
and all that stuff.
Well, hey, baby...

01:24:23.851 --> 01:24:26.936
you know, three dates...
Make it 10, 10 dates.

01:24:28.814 --> 01:24:30.106
How about 15?

01:24:30.190 --> 01:24:33.943
Fifteen. Screw your 15.
20 dates.

01:24:34.194 --> 01:24:36.279
Okay, 20 dates.
Twenty dates.

01:24:36.697 --> 01:24:38.906
Okay.
This is genius.

01:24:39.283 --> 01:24:40.616
It's gonna hurt.

01:24:42.619 --> 01:24:44.620
Not as much as you think.

01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:48.457
We can really get to know
each other this way.

01:24:48.542 --> 01:24:49.542
Yeah.

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:52.545
This is one, right?
No, next one.

01:24:58.552 --> 01:25:00.386
Is it safe to come in,
or are you guys doing it?

01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:02.138
Honey, it's safe.

01:25:04.641 --> 01:25:05.641
Great.

01:25:05.726 --> 01:25:07.393
Well, good timing.

01:25:07.728 --> 01:25:09.395
Yeah.
You remember Marla.

01:25:09.479 --> 01:25:12.398
Hi, we met. And this is
my little bunny rabbit.

01:25:12.482 --> 01:25:13.900
Julia.
Hey.

01:25:13.984 --> 01:25:16.360
This is Andy.
Julia, how you doing?

01:25:17.321 --> 01:25:20.907
You know what, do you
by any chance like magic?

01:25:21.366 --> 01:25:23.868
Yeah.
I thought that you might.

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:25.411
Because I noticed
on the way in...

01:25:25.495 --> 01:25:28.080
that you had something shiny
behind your ear.

01:25:28.165 --> 01:25:30.583
Marla, did you see that?
Something behind her ear?

01:25:30.667 --> 01:25:32.168
You think you do?
Could I check?

01:25:32.252 --> 01:25:34.545
Do you mind if I check
behind your ear?

01:25:34.796 --> 01:25:36.130
Big money!

01:25:37.591 --> 01:25:40.259
That's amazing.
Wow, it is amazing.

01:25:40.344 --> 01:25:42.428
There's something else, too,
behind your ear, I think.

01:25:42.512 --> 01:25:45.139
No, actually it's not behind
your ear. I think it is your ear.

01:25:45.223 --> 01:25:46.223
Rip!

01:25:46.308 --> 01:25:49.769
It is your ear.
There is your ear.

01:25:49.853 --> 01:25:51.145
I ripped it off.

01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:52.772
Gross!
Yeah, that's...

01:25:52.856 --> 01:25:55.816
All right. Wait. Okay,
but that means that you...

01:25:55.901 --> 01:25:58.861
walk around with a rubber ear
in your pocket all day?

01:25:59.863 --> 01:26:01.572
Yeah, like half the time.

01:26:01.865 --> 01:26:03.699
You know, I can come
to your high school...

01:26:03.784 --> 01:26:05.743
and do it for your friends
if you want.

01:26:05.827 --> 01:26:07.620
You know what,
I should head out.

01:26:07.704 --> 01:26:09.038
Really?
Yeah.

01:26:09.122 --> 01:26:10.998
I have to give you
a ride home.

01:26:11.083 --> 01:26:12.291
Right. Yes, you do.

01:26:12.376 --> 01:26:14.627
Yeah, 'cause you don't have
a car or anything, right?

01:26:14.711 --> 01:26:16.253
Right, I don't have a car.

01:26:16.338 --> 01:26:18.965
'Cause he doesn't have a car,
and he does magic.

01:26:19.299 --> 01:26:20.383
Awesome.

01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:23.135
And sarcasm is like
a second language to me.

01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:25.304
So, I'm right there with you.

01:26:28.183 --> 01:26:29.558
But, Dad,

01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:33.604
I don't know how to love.

01:26:34.481 --> 01:26:35.982
You never

01:26:36.066 --> 01:26:40.111
taught me how...

01:26:43.448 --> 01:26:45.324
Hello.
Hey, Cal.

01:26:45.492 --> 01:26:47.702
Hey.
I just got back from a date.

01:26:47.786 --> 01:26:49.912
Did you tell her
you're a virgin?

01:26:50.247 --> 01:26:52.373
No. I haven't gotten
to that yet.

01:26:52.457 --> 01:26:54.667
Really?
Are you having sex right now?

01:26:54.876 --> 01:26:57.086
No. She was incredible.

01:26:57.421 --> 01:26:59.672
She was amazing.
She didn't pressure me.

01:26:59.756 --> 01:27:02.758
And she has three kids.

01:27:02.843 --> 01:27:04.844
And one of her kids
has a kid.

01:27:07.097 --> 01:27:08.347
You all right?

01:27:08.765 --> 01:27:13.019
Did you just say she has three
kids, one of whom has a kid?

01:27:13.103 --> 01:27:15.563
Yeah.
So, so, she's a grandm a?

01:27:15.772 --> 01:27:16.731
No.

01:27:16.815 --> 01:27:18.566
I'm not a doctor
or anything like that

01:27:18.650 --> 01:27:20.818
but she's a fucking grandma.

01:27:21.653 --> 01:27:23.237
Yeah, whatever, you know.

01:27:23.321 --> 01:27:24.697
She's the hottest grandma
I ever saw.

01:27:24.781 --> 01:27:26.198
Yeah, she is.
She's a hot grandm a.

01:27:26.283 --> 01:27:29.035
That's a good-looking grandma. My
grandma looks like Jack Palance.

01:27:29.119 --> 01:27:30.119
Well, she's no Jack Palance.

01:27:30.203 --> 01:27:31.912
No. If Jack Palance
looked like that lady,

01:27:31.997 --> 01:27:33.956
I would want to
fuck Jack Palance right now.

01:27:34.041 --> 01:27:35.082
Yeah, me, too.

01:27:35.625 --> 01:27:36.751
She's a hot grandma.

01:27:36.835 --> 01:27:38.711
Heck, yeah.
No, do a grandm a, m an.

01:27:38.795 --> 01:27:41.589
You should fuck her
on her plastic-covered couch.

01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:44.383
Fuck her while she watches
Murder, She Wrote.

01:27:44.468 --> 01:27:46.052
She would probably find that
very erotic.

01:27:46.136 --> 01:27:47.344
Yeah, whatever, you know.

01:27:47.429 --> 01:27:50.931
Fuck her and then have her send you
a check for $12 on your birthday.

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:53.851
I'm the dude
with the hot granny.

01:27:55.062 --> 01:27:57.021
What did you want to
talk to me about?

01:27:57.105 --> 01:27:58.814
Well, Andy,
the numbers just came in...

01:27:58.899 --> 01:28:02.610
and you are by far
our best salesman.

01:28:02.986 --> 01:28:05.321
So, I am promoting you
to floor manager.

01:28:05.739 --> 01:28:07.573
This is the bullshit
of all bullshits!

01:28:07.657 --> 01:28:09.617
You scumbag! Ass kisser!

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:13.662
Thank you. That's great.

01:28:13.997 --> 01:28:17.708
I understand you have a girlfriend.
Yeah, kind of seeing somebody.

01:28:18.168 --> 01:28:20.795
I'm very happy for you.
Thanks. She's great.

01:28:20.921 --> 01:28:22.546
Are you still a virgin?

01:28:23.673 --> 01:28:25.091
You know, I don't really...

01:28:25.175 --> 01:28:27.093
talk about my personal life.
You're a virgin.

01:28:27.177 --> 01:28:28.511
Yes, I am.
Yeah.

01:28:29.888 --> 01:28:31.639
My door is always open.

01:28:32.224 --> 01:28:34.016
So to speak.
Great.

01:28:35.519 --> 01:28:36.894
Great. Thank you.

01:28:37.395 --> 01:28:39.355
I'm very discreet.

01:28:42.192 --> 01:28:44.610
But I'll haunt your dreams.

01:28:46.530 --> 01:28:47.863
Okay.
Okay.

01:28:53.203 --> 01:28:54.620
Wow.

01:28:56.498 --> 01:29:00.543
So who's gonna take my job? Cal
will be taking over your job.

01:29:00.627 --> 01:29:02.461
And he's interviewing people
right now...

01:29:02.546 --> 01:29:03.796
for his old job.

01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:05.923
So, have you ever worked
with electronics before?

01:29:06.007 --> 01:29:07.133
No.
No?

01:29:07.384 --> 01:29:10.594
But I have electronics
in my home.

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:15.641
Perfect. That's the job pretty
much. You're very well-qualified.

01:29:16.268 --> 01:29:17.810
More than these other losers.

01:29:19.354 --> 01:29:21.981
I could do that...
Wait, last thing.

01:29:22.065 --> 01:29:24.108
I'm also gonna need that
extended warranty on it...

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:26.527
for the price of
"on the house. "

01:29:28.488 --> 01:29:29.780
That I can't do.

01:29:29.865 --> 01:29:32.533
Hey, don't be a Negro. Be my
nigger. All right? Help me out.

01:29:32.617 --> 01:29:34.702
Hold up.
I ain't nobody's nigger.

01:29:35.662 --> 01:29:38.414
I mean, you somebody's nigger
wearing this nigger tie.

01:29:38.498 --> 01:29:39.999
Now you being condescending.

01:29:40.083 --> 01:29:43.586
See, you've been warned, all
right? Just move forward amicably.

01:29:43.670 --> 01:29:45.004
Okay. Well, check this out.

01:29:45.088 --> 01:29:47.173
First of all, you're throwing
too many big words at me.

01:29:47.257 --> 01:29:48.966
Okay, now because
I don't understand them...

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:50.509
I'm gonna take them
as disrespect.

01:29:50.594 --> 01:29:52.928
Watch your mouth,
and help me with the sale.

01:29:53.013 --> 01:29:55.681
Okay, see, now you
found yourself a nigger.

01:29:55.765 --> 01:29:58.601
You were looking for a nigger?
Nigger here now. See?

01:29:58.685 --> 01:30:01.979
Today's forecast: Dark and
cloudy, and chance of drive-by.

01:30:02.272 --> 01:30:04.148
You want to go?
I suggest you move back.

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:05.858
Then, nig, fire on.

01:30:05.942 --> 01:30:07.234
What are we gonna do?

01:30:07.777 --> 01:30:10.529
What are you gonna do,
Mr. Floor Manager?

01:30:11.948 --> 01:30:13.157
Go, get them, tiger.

01:30:13.241 --> 01:30:14.867
This shit just got rigged.

01:30:14.951 --> 01:30:16.869
What are you gonna do, bitch?
I'll tell you what.

01:30:16.953 --> 01:30:18.871
You know Luca Perry
from 20th and 25th?

01:30:18.955 --> 01:30:20.706
You ever heard of,
Rolling 20s, nigger?

01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:23.167
Since I was 16, nigger,
I'm saying "frosty. "

01:30:23.251 --> 01:30:24.877
You know what I'm saying,
"spoon", nigger.

01:30:24.961 --> 01:30:26.629
We fucked dwarfs in the ass.

01:30:26.713 --> 01:30:28.631
Nigger, this dwarf here
don't got to be tall...

01:30:28.715 --> 01:30:30.466
to pull the trigger off
in somebody face!

01:30:30.592 --> 01:30:32.801
Come on nigger, back
up. What's up? Hey...

01:30:32.886 --> 01:30:34.094
Welcome to Smart Tech.

01:30:34.179 --> 01:30:35.554
Is this your boy?
What can I help you with?

01:30:35.639 --> 01:30:37.348
Yeah, nigger,
we will both mash you!

01:30:37.432 --> 01:30:39.141
How can we help you, sir?
Nigger, what?

01:30:39.225 --> 01:30:41.560
No, he don't need no help.
He's already been served.

01:30:41.645 --> 01:30:44.521
I served him. He's taken care of.
He's a little slow, but he got it.

01:30:44.606 --> 01:30:47.274
See, what he thought was he can
come up in here and make the rules.

01:30:47.359 --> 01:30:49.735
But now he see that Jay
make the rules at Smart Tech

01:30:49.819 --> 01:30:52.696
that I run this bitch
and now he bought the bounce.

01:30:54.074 --> 01:30:55.240
This your boy?

01:30:55.367 --> 01:30:57.910
Yeah, that's my boy.
We represent Smart Tech.

01:30:57.994 --> 01:30:59.411
You just got
fucked up with him.

01:30:59.496 --> 01:31:02.039
Both y'all niggers going get
clapped up when I get back.

01:31:03.083 --> 01:31:04.333
Both of you all niggers.

01:31:04.417 --> 01:31:06.543
What did I do?
It don't fucking matter!

01:31:06.795 --> 01:31:09.964
Yeah, aim high, Willis.
Aim high!

01:31:10.048 --> 01:31:11.507
Please don't do this.

01:31:12.467 --> 01:31:14.468
Jay, what's going on?

01:31:16.638 --> 01:31:17.930
Jill broke up with me.

01:31:18.014 --> 01:31:20.516
I'm so sorry.
What happened?

01:31:20.767 --> 01:31:22.851
I came home a little tipsy.

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:25.521
And I had one of my condoms
on still.

01:31:27.565 --> 01:31:30.859
Woke up the next morning and
jumped in the shower with her.

01:31:31.528 --> 01:31:33.445
I don't know
what I was thinking.

01:31:33.530 --> 01:31:34.738
Why did you cheat on her?

01:31:34.823 --> 01:31:37.116
Because I'm insecure!
You can't tell?

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:39.576
I know, man.
It's gonna be okay.

01:31:39.661 --> 01:31:41.787
I'm cold.
It's gonna be all right, man.

01:31:41.871 --> 01:31:43.497
Seriously, man, I'm sorry.

01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:45.499
I apologize to you. I know.

01:31:45.583 --> 01:31:47.418
If you wanna have
a meaningful relationship...

01:31:47.502 --> 01:31:49.712
you've got to leave the sex
out of it, man. You're right.

01:31:49.796 --> 01:31:50.963
It's all right. You're good.

01:31:51.047 --> 01:31:52.881
I'm sorry. Come here.
I love you, man.

01:31:52.966 --> 01:31:54.466
Man, I love you, too.

01:31:55.677 --> 01:31:57.344
You're a good guy.

01:31:59.472 --> 01:32:01.890
Do you know how I know
you guys are gay?

01:32:01.975 --> 01:32:04.393
You're holding each other
ever so gently.

01:32:04.477 --> 01:32:05.477
Cabrón.

01:32:11.985 --> 01:32:13.068
Bravo.

01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:15.154
At least he can cook, Mom.

01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:19.241
? playing)

01:32:19.325 --> 01:32:21.952
I love... Spiderman.

01:32:35.258 --> 01:32:37.509
Pull out slowly
and go straight ahead.

01:33:06.122 --> 01:33:07.289
I'm all right.

01:33:07.791 --> 01:33:08.916
Nobody's there.

01:33:09.084 --> 01:33:11.335
I want to know
everything about you.

01:33:11.419 --> 01:33:12.461
I want to tell you.

01:33:12.545 --> 01:33:13.545
You do?
Yeah.

01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:16.465
Like, what do you want to do?
What are your dreams?

01:33:16.883 --> 01:33:19.885
You don't wanna work at Smart
Tech for the rest of your life.

01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:22.554
I've been working there
for a long time.

01:33:22.639 --> 01:33:26.308
And I've been thinking lately that
maybe I should open my own store.

01:33:26.601 --> 01:33:27.643
Really?
Yeah.

01:33:27.727 --> 01:33:31.146
What kind of store?
Well, like a stereo store.

01:33:31.231 --> 01:33:33.565
Oh, my God, that is...
Why don't you do that?

01:33:33.650 --> 01:33:35.317
I don't have enough money
to do that.

01:33:35.401 --> 01:33:36.860
What about those collectibles?

01:33:36.945 --> 01:33:39.196
I bet if you sold those,
you could make a lot of money.

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:43.117
I just sold a guy's G. I. Joe
for $1,000.

01:33:43.451 --> 01:33:44.910
Really?
Do you have any of those?

01:33:44.994 --> 01:33:46.120
Yeah.
You do?

01:33:46.204 --> 01:33:47.246
I have 47 of them.

01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:48.497
No, you don't.

01:33:48.623 --> 01:33:50.582
Yeah, in their original boxes. You do?

01:33:50.667 --> 01:33:52.751
I could help you
sell them on eBay.

01:33:52.836 --> 01:33:55.921
I would not take a commission,
I swear to God.

01:33:56.005 --> 01:33:59.091
You could do it.
You could totally pull it off.

01:34:00.552 --> 01:34:02.594
Yeah, let's do it.
Let's do it.

01:34:20.738 --> 01:34:21.947
Aquaman.

01:34:22.365 --> 01:34:23.490
Here.

01:34:23.950 --> 01:34:25.325
Clothes on.

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.037
I'll send you off to...

01:34:30.081 --> 01:34:33.000
a farm with lots of land.

01:34:33.084 --> 01:34:35.878
So, you and other Aquamen
can run around...

01:34:37.005 --> 01:34:39.464
and play in the Aquafields.

01:34:49.684 --> 01:34:51.727
Godspeed, Col. Steve Austin.

01:34:54.147 --> 01:34:56.565
You don't wanna go, do you?
Okay, you can stay.

01:34:56.649 --> 01:34:58.525
Steve Austin can stay.

01:35:02.197 --> 01:35:03.989
Hey, Cal. David.

01:35:04.199 --> 01:35:06.408
Way to sell a big TV.

01:35:06.492 --> 01:35:07.993
She likes you, man.

01:35:08.203 --> 01:35:10.204
Too bad I retired my penis.

01:35:10.496 --> 01:35:13.707
Mooj, we try to be fair with
the schedule but it's hard.

01:35:13.875 --> 01:35:17.419
Okay, but why every damn schedule
comes up, I get most early shift?

01:35:17.503 --> 01:35:20.339
It's bullshit. Nobody buys
stereo at 10:00 in the morning.

01:35:20.423 --> 01:35:21.465
No, I understand.

01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:24.468
People buy stereo
between 6:00 and 8:00.

01:35:24.552 --> 01:35:25.552
Mmm-hmm.

01:35:25.637 --> 01:35:29.097
Rich men get off work,
then buy stereo.

01:35:29.182 --> 01:35:31.683
Right.
Not after fucking brunch.

01:35:31.768 --> 01:35:33.393
Okay.
Here's what we're gonna do.

01:35:33.478 --> 01:35:36.063
I'm going to give you
a couple of Jay's shifts.

01:35:36.189 --> 01:35:38.774
And then I'll give you a
couple of mine and that way

01:35:38.858 --> 01:35:42.027
we'll all be equal, okay.
Thank you, Andy.

01:35:42.362 --> 01:35:43.487
It's okay.

01:35:43.863 --> 01:35:45.447
You're a good man, Andy.

01:35:47.617 --> 01:35:50.535
By the way,
what date are you on, now?

01:35:50.912 --> 01:35:53.497
I think it's around 17.

01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:56.333
It's hard to tell what actually
constitutes a date, though.

01:35:56.417 --> 01:36:00.295
Three to go. So that means you're
gonna have sex in three days.

01:36:01.005 --> 01:36:03.382
Maybe, I might try to
space them out a little bit.

01:36:03.466 --> 01:36:06.009
I'll pray for your cock.
Okay, thanks.

01:36:06.219 --> 01:36:08.262
Thanks. Thank you.
Have a good cocky.

01:36:08.429 --> 01:36:11.014
Trish is on the phone.
Here is a shock.

01:36:11.099 --> 01:36:13.058
Girlfriend with a problem.
Hello.

01:36:13.267 --> 01:36:15.477
I have done everything
but sex!

01:36:15.561 --> 01:36:18.021
I'm a wom an, okay?
Deal with it!

01:36:18.106 --> 01:36:20.190
I'm gonna start
taking you back to church.

01:36:20.274 --> 01:36:22.192
We are gonna start
going to church.

01:36:22.276 --> 01:36:23.777
Hello?
You know what?

01:36:23.861 --> 01:36:25.195
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:36:25.279 --> 01:36:27.906
Oh, my God, I cannot believe
this. Thank God you're here.

01:36:27.991 --> 01:36:31.034
Jesus Christ. Marla locked
herself in the bathroom.

01:36:31.119 --> 01:36:32.035
What happened?

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:33.870
She wants to go
to the family health clinic.

01:36:33.955 --> 01:36:35.998
She wants birth control.
But she's too young.

01:36:36.082 --> 01:36:39.251
I want to have sex with my
boyfriend! But I can't, Mom!

01:36:39.335 --> 01:36:40.627
So, you want me
to take her?

01:36:40.670 --> 01:36:42.754
No, I don't want you to
take her. Okay, all right.

01:36:42.839 --> 01:36:45.674
I want her to keep it in her
pants until she gets to college.

01:36:45.758 --> 01:36:46.800
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:36:46.884 --> 01:36:48.135
"Keep it in my pants"?

01:36:48.219 --> 01:36:50.846
Okay, you didn't keep it
in your pants, Mom.

01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:54.391
I know. I don't want you to make
the same mistakes as me, Marla.

01:36:54.475 --> 01:36:57.477
Mistakes? Okay,
so I was a mistake then.

01:36:57.562 --> 01:37:01.481
No, you're not a mistake.
Your sister was the mistake.

01:37:02.191 --> 01:37:03.692
Oh, my God!

01:37:04.110 --> 01:37:06.903
Her older sister, I mean, she
wasn't planned, you know what I mean?

01:37:06.988 --> 01:37:09.531
Because I was such a... Oh, God,
you wanna run away, don't you?

01:37:09.615 --> 01:37:10.657
No.

01:37:10.742 --> 01:37:13.577
You and your boyfriend
have sex all the time!

01:37:13.661 --> 01:37:15.370
Oh, my God!
Are you kidding?

01:37:15.455 --> 01:37:17.247
We never have sex.
Do we ever have sex?

01:37:17.331 --> 01:37:18.665
No, we don't.

01:37:18.958 --> 01:37:20.751
What? Yes, you do!

01:37:20.835 --> 01:37:23.503
You're such a liar!
Why do you lie to me?

01:37:23.588 --> 01:37:24.588
Why?

01:37:28.176 --> 01:37:30.093
I didn't hear anything
after "a liar. "

01:37:30.219 --> 01:37:33.055
What did she say after "a liar"?
She sounds like a tea kettle.

01:37:33.139 --> 01:37:35.015
Fuck you!

01:37:37.351 --> 01:37:39.811
Maybe I should take her.
No, I don't think so.

01:37:39.896 --> 01:37:42.355
You know, a little information
never hurt anybody.

01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:57.454
Cool.

01:37:58.539 --> 01:37:59.581
Wow!

01:38:02.043 --> 01:38:04.169
Where do you put the penis?

01:38:05.171 --> 01:38:06.505
Oh, shit.

01:38:16.891 --> 01:38:18.558
It is

01:38:19.393 --> 01:38:21.019
not a Rubik's Cube.

01:38:23.689 --> 01:38:24.689
Shit.

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:28.485
God, how much longer
are they gonna make us wait?

01:38:28.569 --> 01:38:31.113
I don't know. They should be
out in a second.

01:38:31.531 --> 01:38:32.614
Now, you're all here

01:38:32.698 --> 01:38:35.075
because you're interested
in obtaining birth control.

01:38:35.159 --> 01:38:36.409
Any questions?

01:38:37.036 --> 01:38:39.329
Here's a cute story.
I came home the other day

01:38:39.413 --> 01:38:42.415
and he is with his girlfriend
in my marital bed

01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:45.418
doing things that are illegal
in Alabama.

01:38:45.545 --> 01:38:48.880
Sex acts, right? Things
that my wife won't do, okay?

01:38:49.298 --> 01:38:52.134
Did you have a question? How
do I get my wife to do that?

01:38:52.218 --> 01:38:53.635
Does anybody else
have a question?

01:38:53.719 --> 01:38:57.055
My daughter is,
for lack of a better word,

01:38:57.431 --> 01:38:58.557
dumb.

01:38:58.808 --> 01:39:00.976
How do I stop
her menstrual cycle?

01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:03.311
You want her to stop
having a menstrual cycle?

01:39:03.396 --> 01:39:06.022
I want to stop it,
maybe just for a few years.

01:39:06.107 --> 01:39:08.275
Yeah, I don't think
that's a good idea.

01:39:08.401 --> 01:39:11.486
Does anybody else have a
question? I have a question.

01:39:11.571 --> 01:39:15.407
I think some of the people here
might be sexually inexperienced.

01:39:16.033 --> 01:39:19.077
Is it true that if you
don't use it, you lose it?

01:39:19.453 --> 01:39:21.037
Is that a serious question?

01:39:21.164 --> 01:39:22.789
No. It wasn't.
Okay.

01:39:23.416 --> 01:39:27.002
Now, there are a lot of
activities that you can engage in

01:39:27.086 --> 01:39:29.921
without having sex
that are both fun and safe.

01:39:30.006 --> 01:39:32.090
What sort of activities?
I think

01:39:32.175 --> 01:39:34.384
everybody wants to know
about the activities.

01:39:34.468 --> 01:39:39.055
Well, instead of having intercourse,
you could have outer-course.

01:39:39.515 --> 01:39:41.641
Outer-course?
What's that?

01:39:41.767 --> 01:39:43.101
Yeah, what is that?

01:39:43.186 --> 01:39:47.314
Outer-course is anything that
isn't vaginal intercourse.

01:39:47.607 --> 01:39:49.608
I prefer
vaginal intercourse.

01:39:51.277 --> 01:39:52.611
He really does.

01:39:52.945 --> 01:39:56.489
Now, there are ways of having
sex without intercourse.

01:39:57.617 --> 01:40:01.036
Let's see, there are things
like body rubbing or dry humping.

01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:02.412
You could dry hump.

01:40:02.496 --> 01:40:05.624
There is masturbation.
Masturbation. Play with yourself.

01:40:05.708 --> 01:40:07.709
Mutual masturbation.
Play with a friend.

01:40:07.793 --> 01:40:11.379
Deep kissing.
There is erotic massage.

01:40:11.464 --> 01:40:13.340
That sounds like
it would be nice.

01:40:13.424 --> 01:40:16.009
Oral sex play.
Sounds like my Friday night.

01:40:16.093 --> 01:40:17.969
Shut up, Seth.
We went to temple.

01:40:18.054 --> 01:40:19.846
Okay,
are there any virgins here

01:40:19.931 --> 01:40:22.641
who are thinking about
having sex for the first time?

01:40:23.893 --> 01:40:24.893
Oh.

01:40:25.311 --> 01:40:27.479
Wait. So you're
a virgin?

01:40:30.024 --> 01:40:32.901
I'd tap that.
Oh, yeah, you'd "tap that"?

01:40:32.985 --> 01:40:35.904
Seth, what, you think you're
cool with your little Jew fro?

01:40:35.988 --> 01:40:39.241
We don't say, "tap that. " What
are you talking about, Seth?

01:40:39.325 --> 01:40:41.576
You know what,
I'm a virgin, too.

01:40:43.663 --> 01:40:44.746
That's...

01:40:44.830 --> 01:40:46.706
We're virgins, too.
Yeah.

01:40:48.668 --> 01:40:51.586
No, you know what,
it's a personal choice

01:40:51.671 --> 01:40:53.213
and I don't think
it's weird at all.

01:40:53.297 --> 01:40:54.547
You know what
your problem is?

01:40:54.632 --> 01:40:56.341
You're putting the pussy
on a pedestal.

01:40:56.425 --> 01:40:58.134
That's the second time
I've heard that.

01:40:58.219 --> 01:41:00.136
What is the
"pussy on a pedestal" thing?

01:41:00.221 --> 01:41:04.099
Okay, I can't listen to anymore of
this, 'cause it's making me sick.

01:41:04.183 --> 01:41:05.141
So, bye.

01:41:05.226 --> 01:41:07.352
You can get this information
on your website, right?

01:41:07.478 --> 01:41:09.187
Yes. Thanks. Nice meeting everybody.

01:41:09.272 --> 01:41:10.397
Any other questions?

01:41:10.481 --> 01:41:12.399
Do you have any
extra-large condoms?

01:41:12.483 --> 01:41:14.317
Seth, you got
a tiny penis.

01:41:18.406 --> 01:41:21.533
So, I made that all up
to help you out.

01:41:23.619 --> 01:41:25.161
No, you didn't.

01:41:25.371 --> 01:41:28.707
But thank you
for doing that.

01:41:31.585 --> 01:41:33.211
How can you tell?

01:41:33.379 --> 01:41:35.797
Well, you know, I go to school
with, like, 400 guys

01:41:35.881 --> 01:41:37.299
who are all trying
to have sex.

01:41:37.383 --> 01:41:39.342
And, yeah,
so I can tell who's done it.

01:41:39.427 --> 01:41:40.468
Of course.

01:41:40.553 --> 01:41:43.471
And you really haven't?
No, I really haven't.

01:41:43.973 --> 01:41:46.349
Please don't tell your mom,
okay?

01:41:46.434 --> 01:41:48.184
Yeah, I won't.
Thanks.

01:41:48.269 --> 01:41:51.438
But when are you
gonna tell her?

01:41:51.647 --> 01:41:53.606
Believe me,
I'm working on it.

01:41:54.984 --> 01:41:56.568
I am working on it.

01:41:59.739 --> 01:42:00.947
Do you have any weed?

01:42:02.908 --> 01:42:04.159
Yeah.
You do have some.

01:42:04.243 --> 01:42:06.369
Can spare any
or is it all spoken for?

01:42:07.079 --> 01:42:09.080
I mean, like what
are we talking? Are we...

01:42:09.165 --> 01:42:11.624
Just enough to get me
baked for like a week.

01:42:11.876 --> 01:42:12.917
That's a lot of weed.

01:42:13.002 --> 01:42:14.919
Yeah, I am taking vacation
next week, so...

01:42:15.004 --> 01:42:16.838
Where are you going?
I'm not going anywhere.

01:42:16.922 --> 01:42:18.673
I'll stay in my apartment.
Just getting baked?

01:42:18.758 --> 01:42:20.258
I want to be baked
the whole time.

01:42:20.343 --> 01:42:22.719
Watch TV,
I'll probably re-watch Gandhi.

01:42:23.346 --> 01:42:25.263
Gandhi baked is good.
Yes, isn't it?

01:42:25.348 --> 01:42:26.973
I always feel bad
when I watch it baked

01:42:27.058 --> 01:42:28.975
'cause I get really hungry
and I'm eating a lot

01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:30.060
and poor Gandhi is

01:42:30.144 --> 01:42:31.853
fucking starving his ass off.
Starving, I know.

01:42:35.483 --> 01:42:36.983
Sounds good.
Yeah.

01:42:37.068 --> 01:42:39.778
I'm going to take her to
capacity. Are you okay with that?

01:42:39.862 --> 01:42:41.196
Give it a shot.

01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:43.406
Freak! Oh, yeah!

01:42:45.117 --> 01:42:47.702
Michael McDonald, man,
I haven't heard this in years.

01:42:47.787 --> 01:42:49.954
Yeah, I haven't heard it
in like 48 minutes.

01:42:50.664 --> 01:42:53.375
If I get the set,
will you throw in the DVD?

01:42:53.459 --> 01:42:55.752
You don't get the set.
I'll throw in the DVD.

01:42:56.253 --> 01:42:57.295
I'll take it.

01:42:57.380 --> 01:42:59.172
Really?
Yeah.

01:43:00.299 --> 01:43:02.258
Y'all want to see something
beautiful? Come here.

01:43:02.343 --> 01:43:05.512
You want to see the most beautiful
thing in the world? Check this out.

01:43:05.596 --> 01:43:09.307
This is my baby right here.
That's my baby's dick right there.

01:43:09.934 --> 01:43:11.684
Looks like a poltergeist.

01:43:11.977 --> 01:43:13.269
That is his foot.

01:43:13.354 --> 01:43:15.688
Look at his dick.
That's not even four months.

01:43:15.773 --> 01:43:17.065
Extrapolate that.

01:43:17.149 --> 01:43:19.526
By the time he's 30,
what's gonna happen?

01:43:19.610 --> 01:43:21.861
Yo, Andy! Come check this out,
dawg.

01:43:21.946 --> 01:43:24.531
Is this the movie about babies
that are geniuses?

01:43:24.615 --> 01:43:27.075
No, this is my child, dude.
Jill is pregnant.

01:43:27.159 --> 01:43:28.284
That's yours?
Yeah.

01:43:28.369 --> 01:43:30.370
That's why she broke up
with me in the first place...

01:43:30.454 --> 01:43:32.705
'cause she just thought that
I wouldn't be a good father...

01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:35.083
in light of the fact that I'd
be cheating on her all the time.

01:43:35.167 --> 01:43:36.876
But she got over all that.
It's cool now.

01:43:36.961 --> 01:43:38.878
Congratulations, man.
That is great.

01:43:39.130 --> 01:43:40.713
We having
a party tonight, Andy...

01:43:40.798 --> 01:43:42.340
and I really want you
to be there, man.

01:43:42.425 --> 01:43:44.884
We celebrating and I really,
really want you to be there.

01:43:44.969 --> 01:43:47.470
It looks like
the Doppler radar.

01:43:47.555 --> 01:43:48.596
Can you believe that?

01:43:48.681 --> 01:43:50.306
This child
ain't even four months old.

01:43:50.391 --> 01:43:52.642
He ain't four months old yet.
Look at what he's packing.

01:43:52.726 --> 01:43:55.228
Everybody dick looks big
on 60-inch TV.

01:43:55.312 --> 01:43:57.897
My sister's dick looks big
on TV, okay?

01:43:58.858 --> 01:44:01.526
Oh, my God,
this guy, Eric Gilliland...

01:44:01.986 --> 01:44:04.571
he has bought, like,
15 of these. Really?

01:44:04.655 --> 01:44:07.615
Yeah, I think he likes action
figures even more than you.

01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:10.243
That is impossible.
I think so.

01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:14.414
Andy, the way these things
are flying off your shelf...

01:44:14.498 --> 01:44:17.459
you know, I think you
could actually make like...

01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:19.502
maybe like $100,000.

01:44:19.587 --> 01:44:21.754
Really? Yeah, you could open your store.

01:44:21.839 --> 01:44:23.214
Wow.
Honey...

01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:25.508
That's a lot of money.
I know.

01:44:25.593 --> 01:44:28.261
That's incredible. I wouldn't
have done it without you.

01:44:28.345 --> 01:44:29.512
Thanks.

01:44:30.181 --> 01:44:33.016
And that's not the only good news. What?

01:44:33.434 --> 01:44:36.394
You know what tonight is?
Survivor is on?

01:44:37.688 --> 01:44:39.230
No.
I know.

01:44:39.857 --> 01:44:42.400
Is it The Aqqrentice?

01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:44.360
No.

01:44:45.196 --> 01:44:46.196
What?

01:44:48.908 --> 01:44:53.244
It's our 20th date.

01:44:59.793 --> 01:45:01.211
Wow.
Yeah.

01:45:01.295 --> 01:45:02.629
Really?
Uh-huh.

01:45:02.713 --> 01:45:05.965
Seriously?
I think we're at 18.

01:45:06.050 --> 01:45:07.759
'Cause there were
a couple of dates there...

01:45:07.885 --> 01:45:09.719
that don't really count as dates. No.

01:45:09.803 --> 01:45:12.472
I'll give you a free pass
on those other ones.

01:45:13.516 --> 01:45:14.641
Thank you.

01:45:14.725 --> 01:45:15.850
Listen.
What?

01:45:15.935 --> 01:45:17.185
Listen.
Mmm-hmm.

01:45:18.687 --> 01:45:20.313
I really like you.

01:45:26.278 --> 01:45:28.071
I think I'm falling for you.

01:45:28.906 --> 01:45:32.700
I don't know. I kind of see
this going somewhere.

01:45:33.035 --> 01:45:34.244
I do, too.

01:45:34.328 --> 01:45:37.539
I just think we should just
go crazy on each other.

01:45:38.749 --> 01:45:40.750
Okay.
Okay?

01:45:41.627 --> 01:45:42.919
Oh, thank God!

01:45:45.714 --> 01:45:46.714
Oh!

01:45:47.383 --> 01:45:49.801
Okay, I should...
I gotta pick those up.

01:45:49.885 --> 01:45:51.010
Don't pick them up now.

01:45:51.095 --> 01:45:52.387
No, I have to pick those up
right now.

01:45:52.471 --> 01:45:54.556
Wait, we'll get them later.
Listen, no, I can't, no.

01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:56.266
Listen, it's really important
because...

01:45:56.350 --> 01:45:58.601
once the integrity of the box
gets compromised...

01:45:58.686 --> 01:46:00.979
This is original packaging
and that's why these things...

01:46:01.063 --> 01:46:03.147
are so valuable.
So you don't screw with that.

01:46:03.274 --> 01:46:05.275
You really don't screw
with that. All right.

01:46:05.359 --> 01:46:07.402
We can wrap them again later,
you know.

01:46:07.486 --> 01:46:08.861
Yeah, I know.
But you know what...

01:46:08.946 --> 01:46:11.030
this is very important that
we don't lose the value...

01:46:11.115 --> 01:46:12.448
and compromise
the integrity of it.

01:46:12.533 --> 01:46:14.742
Andy, I'm throwing myself
at you and...

01:46:14.827 --> 01:46:16.869
all you can think about
is a fucking toy.

01:46:16.954 --> 01:46:20.039
They're not fucking toys!
This is Iron Man, okay?

01:46:20.124 --> 01:46:22.542
I got this
when I was in second grade.

01:46:22.751 --> 01:46:25.420
Do you know how hard it is
for a kid to not open that?

01:46:25.504 --> 01:46:26.713
This is important.

01:46:26.797 --> 01:46:28.089
These are my things...

01:46:28.173 --> 01:46:31.467
and you are trying to make me
sell them and I don't want to.

01:46:31.552 --> 01:46:32.885
No.
And you're making me.

01:46:32.970 --> 01:46:35.054
I'm not making...
You are encouraging me...

01:46:35.139 --> 01:46:37.265
to quit my job.
I'm not! I'm not trying to...

01:46:37.349 --> 01:46:40.059
You want me to open a store.
You want me to sell everything.

01:46:40.144 --> 01:46:41.894
You know what,
I'm gonna tell you something.

01:46:41.979 --> 01:46:45.189
I don't just change like that.
I can't just change for you.

01:46:45.274 --> 01:46:48.067
I don't... I'm not trying
to change you. I like you.

01:46:48.152 --> 01:46:50.278
I'm just... I'm trying
to help you grow up, Andy.

01:46:50.362 --> 01:46:52.030
Well, thanks a lot.

01:46:52.114 --> 01:46:56.117
I mean, my God, you ride a
bicycle to work in a stockroom.

01:46:56.201 --> 01:46:58.536
You know what, I'm not
in the stockroom anymore.

01:46:58.621 --> 01:47:00.079
I'm a floor manager.
Okay.

01:47:00.164 --> 01:47:03.207
And I ride a bike because I
like to. Einstein rode a bike.

01:47:03.292 --> 01:47:06.002
He had a wife who he fucked,
by the way.

01:47:06.670 --> 01:47:08.921
What do I have to do
for you to have sex with me?

01:47:09.006 --> 01:47:11.507
Do you want me to dress up like
Thor? I'll dress up like Thor.

01:47:11.592 --> 01:47:13.176
I'll dress up like Iron Man.

01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:14.969
What do they do?
I'll do it.

01:47:15.054 --> 01:47:16.929
What? Everything's always
about sex.

01:47:17.014 --> 01:47:18.598
Why don't you want
to have sex with me?

01:47:18.682 --> 01:47:21.100
Why not? Tell me.
You tell me the truth.

01:47:21.185 --> 01:47:23.394
Is it because I have a kid
who has a kid? Is that why?

01:47:23.479 --> 01:47:24.979
No, it's cool that
you're a grandmother.

01:47:25.064 --> 01:47:26.689
I love the fact
that you're a grandmother.

01:47:26.774 --> 01:47:29.317
Oh, God! You are. You're a hot grandma.

01:47:29.401 --> 01:47:30.568
Oh, my God!

01:47:30.653 --> 01:47:32.737
You are so mean! Get out!

01:47:32.821 --> 01:47:35.531
Okay, fine. Good!
Good, fine. You're gonna go.

01:47:35.616 --> 01:47:38.993
I didn't ask for any of this.
You asked for all of it, Andy.

01:47:39.370 --> 01:47:40.787
Okay. Great.

01:47:43.957 --> 01:47:44.957
Okay.

01:47:45.334 --> 01:47:46.918
That's the way
you want it

01:47:47.002 --> 01:47:49.921
that's the way
homie's gonna play it.

01:47:51.048 --> 01:47:52.715
Yeah. Truth be told.

01:48:10.150 --> 01:48:12.318
Baby, you better
enjoy yourself tonight

01:48:12.403 --> 01:48:14.696
'cause once this baby's born,
you ain't going out again

01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:15.822
till that baby is in college.

01:48:15.906 --> 01:48:17.115
Me?
Yeah.

01:48:17.199 --> 01:48:19.534
You the club rat. I'm not
the one that be going out.

01:48:19.618 --> 01:48:21.369
I'm not a club rat.

01:48:21.453 --> 01:48:24.205
You're gonna get up,
you march over there

01:48:24.289 --> 01:48:26.791
and I want you
to hit on Bernadette now.

01:48:27.042 --> 01:48:29.043
Dude, I'm not gonna hit
on Bernadette.

01:48:29.128 --> 01:48:30.253
Yes, you are, man,

01:48:30.337 --> 01:48:32.922
'cause your depression
is boring me for one thing

01:48:33.006 --> 01:48:34.966
and it's actually making me
a little depressed

01:48:35.050 --> 01:48:37.009
which is then in turn
making me more depressed

01:48:37.094 --> 01:48:38.845
that you're actually
affecting my mood.

01:48:38.929 --> 01:48:42.265
Look, I'm not in any kind of place
to talk to a woman, all right?

01:48:42.349 --> 01:48:44.517
I'm just... I'm fragile.

01:48:44.643 --> 01:48:46.519
I hired her for you.

01:48:46.603 --> 01:48:50.189
I hired a 90-pound girl to work
in the stockroom at Smart Tech

01:48:50.274 --> 01:48:51.816
for you, okay?

01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:53.401
I should have hired
a 300-pound guy

01:48:53.485 --> 01:48:55.069
who could lift
a 60-inch flat screen.

01:48:55.154 --> 01:48:57.655
But instead
I hired a hot girl

01:48:57.740 --> 01:49:01.117
who can't lift an iPod
to bring you out of your funk.

01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:03.411
You hired her for me?
Yes.

01:49:03.495 --> 01:49:04.912
So will you go talk to her?

01:49:04.997 --> 01:49:06.831
Yeah, I'm meeting somebody.

01:49:06.999 --> 01:49:07.999
No.

01:49:11.628 --> 01:49:13.755
Did you just flick me in the nuts? No.

01:49:13.839 --> 01:49:16.841
Flicked you in the fleshy patch
where your nuts used to be.

01:49:18.010 --> 01:49:19.802
Quit flicking my balls, man.

01:49:19.887 --> 01:49:22.430
Okay, I'll stop
flicking your balls.

01:49:22.514 --> 01:49:24.932
But I'll start punching
your nuts.

01:49:25.851 --> 01:49:26.851
Oh!

01:49:27.519 --> 01:49:28.686
Okay.

01:49:32.399 --> 01:49:33.858
Well played, sir.

01:49:34.234 --> 01:49:35.401
Okay.
Thank you.

01:49:35.486 --> 01:49:37.612
No problem, man.
Go get 'em.

01:49:38.197 --> 01:49:39.947
Mooj, you done
see my son,

01:49:40.032 --> 01:49:41.657
you know his foot gonna be
bigger than this.

01:49:41.742 --> 01:49:44.952
If that baby looks Pakistani,
don't fucking look at me, okay?

01:49:45.037 --> 01:49:48.623
I wouldn't mind. You got good
genes. How old are you? What, 138?

01:49:48.707 --> 01:49:51.626
When your son is born,
is he already in parole?

01:49:59.968 --> 01:50:03.346
I need some poon.

01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:06.682
You guys were so right,
right from the beginning.

01:50:06.975 --> 01:50:11.646
I need genital to genital
connection and that's all I need.

01:50:12.105 --> 01:50:15.650
You know, the thing about
relationships is that they

01:50:15.859 --> 01:50:17.568
make one person go...

01:50:19.154 --> 01:50:21.364
And the other person go,
"What are you talking about?"

01:50:21.448 --> 01:50:22.657
And then one person goes...

01:50:24.284 --> 01:50:25.910
How much have you had
to drink, man?

01:50:25.994 --> 01:50:29.497
How much have I had to drink?
How many pots have you smoken?

01:50:29.581 --> 01:50:30.706
What are you
talking about?

01:50:30.791 --> 01:50:34.043
How many times have you gone
to the bathroom in your life?

01:50:34.127 --> 01:50:35.336
Let me ask you that.

01:50:35.420 --> 01:50:38.381
You know what, you don't have
an answer for that, do you?

01:50:38.465 --> 01:50:40.049
Fuck you, man! I'm sorry.

01:50:40.133 --> 01:50:43.344
No, you're such a good guy,
and I appreciate you.

01:50:43.428 --> 01:50:45.388
What's up, baby, I didn't know
you had came already.

01:50:45.472 --> 01:50:47.640
Hey, motherfucker!

01:50:50.018 --> 01:50:52.103
Man, you know what,
tonight is the night.

01:50:52.187 --> 01:50:56.899
You know what, you were
totally right and I was wrong.

01:50:57.109 --> 01:51:01.696
You were right all along.
You cannot have a relationship

01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:03.948
with somebody until

01:51:04.616 --> 01:51:07.034
you have sex
and that's the long...

01:51:07.119 --> 01:51:08.870
That's the long
and short of it.

01:51:08.954 --> 01:51:12.415
So, thank you.
That's good.

01:51:12.749 --> 01:51:15.710
And now I have to go hunt
for some hos.

01:51:18.589 --> 01:51:21.883
He going to be all right?
No, I don't think he is.

01:51:22.009 --> 01:51:24.343
Cal's a good guy.
Yeah, he's a great guy.

01:51:24.428 --> 01:51:26.178
It's so funny, because,
you know,

01:51:26.263 --> 01:51:29.056
when I first met him and I
thought you were cute at the store,

01:51:29.141 --> 01:51:32.143
he told me you were gay.
I'm not gay.

01:51:32.477 --> 01:51:35.104
Cal says that I'm gay because
he has a real problem

01:51:35.188 --> 01:51:37.523
with his own gayness.

01:51:37.608 --> 01:51:40.902
But seriously, I'm going to
lay it out for you, right now.

01:51:41.528 --> 01:51:43.863
I was a little reticent
to come over and talk to you.

01:51:43.947 --> 01:51:46.741
You're very pretty and you
seem very nice. The truth is

01:51:46.825 --> 01:51:50.494
I dated this woman, let me
rephrase that, I dated this whore

01:51:51.038 --> 01:51:52.622
who stomped
all over my heart.

01:51:52.706 --> 01:51:55.583
And it's just taking me
a little while to kind of,

01:51:55.667 --> 01:51:57.251
you know,
get back in the game.

01:51:57.336 --> 01:51:58.753
Oh, my God. Say no more.

01:51:58.837 --> 01:52:01.464
My last boyfriend Sal junior,
is a scum bag.

01:52:01.548 --> 01:52:03.716
I would totally pay people
to have him killed.

01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:05.927
That's how much I fucking hate
that damn scum bag.

01:52:06.011 --> 01:52:08.179
God, you're fucking awesome.
You too.

01:52:10.015 --> 01:52:11.933
Hey, you!

01:52:14.019 --> 01:52:15.728
Hey.
Hey.

01:52:16.021 --> 01:52:17.521
How you doing?

01:52:17.981 --> 01:52:20.524
Much better,
now that I'm talking to you.

01:52:20.776 --> 01:52:23.361
Hey, lookie,
I can see through your shirt.

01:52:24.154 --> 01:52:25.404
Nice.

01:52:26.615 --> 01:52:29.325
So, you think we should

01:52:29.618 --> 01:52:32.203
take this party
to my apartment or what?

01:52:32.704 --> 01:52:35.748
I am RSVPing "yes. "

01:52:39.461 --> 01:52:42.672
Hope you have a big trunk
because I'm putting my bike in it.

01:52:45.509 --> 01:52:47.009
Yeah, let's go!

01:52:52.099 --> 01:52:54.725
Mom, I left my phone somewhere
and I...

01:52:55.435 --> 01:52:56.560
Thank you.

01:52:57.896 --> 01:53:01.190
What's the matter?
Where is Andy?

01:53:01.316 --> 01:53:04.235
We had a big fight, just...
Oh, Mom.

01:53:04.736 --> 01:53:06.821
He just
stormed out of here.

01:53:06.905 --> 01:53:07.989
What happened?

01:53:08.073 --> 01:53:10.700
Well, I just... Wait a minute,
I thought you hated him.

01:53:10.784 --> 01:53:14.328
I don't hate him. I mean,
he does do magic, but,

01:53:14.413 --> 01:53:16.789
you know, he's a big dork

01:53:17.207 --> 01:53:19.500
and I like seeing you happy.

01:53:21.253 --> 01:53:22.378
I do.

01:53:24.297 --> 01:53:26.799
That's sweet, that's really sweet. Mom.

01:53:27.467 --> 01:53:30.428
Why don't you just go
talk to him, work it out.

01:53:30.512 --> 01:53:33.347
'Cause if the thing is that
important, you can't just stop.

01:53:34.099 --> 01:53:36.308
Let me dance for you.
I would love it.

01:53:37.561 --> 01:53:41.397
Look at your bra and your breasts
and everything. That's so great.

01:53:42.399 --> 01:53:45.901
Wow! You know what?
You're so hot. You're so hot.

01:53:46.194 --> 01:53:47.820
I'm smoking hot.

01:53:47.904 --> 01:53:50.740
You know what? I'm just going
to have sex with you.

01:53:50.824 --> 01:53:52.908
Yes! Let's have sex.

01:53:52.993 --> 01:53:55.202
It's going to happen.
That's why we are here.

01:53:55.287 --> 01:53:57.663
That's totally what's going
to happen.

01:53:57.914 --> 01:54:00.041
We could do it in the...

01:54:01.043 --> 01:54:02.710
Butt, if you want to.

01:54:04.421 --> 01:54:06.338
But, if I want to what?

01:54:06.798 --> 01:54:09.842
Butt.
But what? What?

01:54:09.968 --> 01:54:11.969
Do it.
Do it?

01:54:12.137 --> 01:54:13.137
What?

01:54:13.638 --> 01:54:16.474
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:18.642
Butt.
But...

01:54:18.894 --> 01:54:20.227
What?
... what?

01:54:23.231 --> 01:54:25.524
But, it still feels so right.

01:54:38.330 --> 01:54:39.455
Yeah!

01:54:41.958 --> 01:54:45.795
Yeah. Right! Okay. Yeah.

01:54:47.214 --> 01:54:48.964
That was a fun day.

01:54:50.509 --> 01:54:53.594
You are so kinky.

01:54:54.304 --> 01:54:56.013
Yeah, I'm so kinky.

01:54:56.556 --> 01:54:59.767
That's why I did this
because I thought it looks...

01:54:59.851 --> 01:55:02.353
You like to shave, don't you?

01:55:02.437 --> 01:55:05.231
Let's shave each other. I
don't think you have any hair.

01:55:05.315 --> 01:55:07.108
You know where to shave me.

01:55:07.192 --> 01:55:09.276
Yeah.
Because I want to shave you.

01:55:09.361 --> 01:55:11.028
I want to shave your head.

01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:14.156
I wanna give you
a buzz cut.

01:55:15.158 --> 01:55:16.867
Let's get in the bath.

01:55:17.202 --> 01:55:18.702
In the bath?

01:55:18.787 --> 01:55:23.165
Yes. We're gonna get dirty.
Dirty, dirty. Sudsy.

01:55:23.250 --> 01:55:25.292
It's just about time
I got really dirty.

01:55:25.377 --> 01:55:26.418
Yeah.

01:55:29.214 --> 01:55:33.968
Hey. Hi, it's me, and I'm
on my way to your house.

01:55:34.052 --> 01:55:36.387
I want to do whatever
you want to do, okay?

01:55:36.555 --> 01:55:40.432
Fifty dates. 100.
I hope not, but whatever.

01:55:41.059 --> 01:55:43.811
I'm gonna see you soon,
okay? Bye.

01:55:47.858 --> 01:55:50.776
Wow. Okay, well,
that was fast. Okay.

01:55:53.238 --> 01:55:56.198
Wow! Holy shit!

01:55:56.449 --> 01:55:59.034
Wow. This is just
the right thing to happen.

01:55:59.536 --> 01:56:02.913
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Wow!
Almost got my penis.

01:56:02.998 --> 01:56:04.415
Come to mama.

01:56:06.001 --> 01:56:08.794
I'm gonna really take care
of you tonight.

01:56:09.045 --> 01:56:11.589
You're never
gonna forget Beth.

01:56:21.725 --> 01:56:23.767
I just want to please you.

01:56:24.603 --> 01:56:26.187
What do you like?

01:56:27.022 --> 01:56:30.107
I don't know.
What do you like?

01:56:30.650 --> 01:56:32.776
Can I show you what I like?

01:56:33.278 --> 01:56:34.361
Okay.

01:56:48.001 --> 01:56:50.794
It's so hot in here.

01:56:51.546 --> 01:56:53.923
I wanna introduce you
to my friend.

01:56:58.261 --> 01:57:00.304
Your friend is so shiny.

01:57:01.306 --> 01:57:04.308
This guy knows exactly
what I like.

01:57:09.648 --> 01:57:11.357
Where's you friend going?

01:57:13.193 --> 01:57:15.819
This is how I'm gonna
warm up for you.

01:57:17.113 --> 01:57:20.950
That's always good to warm up.
You don't wanna pull something.

01:57:38.593 --> 01:57:40.970
Wow, this is graphic.

01:57:54.818 --> 01:57:56.277
I can't do it.

01:57:57.904 --> 01:58:00.572
God, what are you
doing here?

01:58:00.657 --> 01:58:03.284
We came here because we were
concerned about you and Trish

01:58:03.368 --> 01:58:05.494
and now I could not give
a fuck.

01:58:05.578 --> 01:58:08.205
How did you even know
where she lives?

01:58:08.331 --> 01:58:10.624
I hit it like eight months back. What?

01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:13.460
Never gave her back the key,
man. You have no idea

01:58:13.545 --> 01:58:15.587
where this is going, all
right? That girl is a freak.

01:58:15.672 --> 01:58:19.133
Oh, it's happening!
It's happening! Andy!

01:58:19.551 --> 01:58:20.759
You think?

01:58:21.052 --> 01:58:23.304
We've been talking,
and look,

01:58:23.722 --> 01:58:26.015
if you love Trish,
you can't do this.

01:58:26.099 --> 01:58:29.143
Look, you guys, I don't
know what I'm doing anymore.

01:58:29.227 --> 01:58:31.812
I don't even know who I am.
All I know is

01:58:31.896 --> 01:58:35.399
that woman
scares the shit out of me

01:58:35.567 --> 01:58:37.776
and I just wanna go home,
okay?

01:58:37.986 --> 01:58:40.279
Let's go.
We should all get out of here.

01:58:40.363 --> 01:58:42.072
Okay.
We should all go.

01:58:42.157 --> 01:58:43.532
It wasn't that good
for me.

01:58:43.616 --> 01:58:45.492
We should totally
get out of here.

01:58:45.577 --> 01:58:47.786
We should run away
from here.

01:58:54.252 --> 01:58:55.294
Hey.

01:58:56.796 --> 01:58:57.880
Cal.

01:59:00.633 --> 01:59:02.343
Go around!

01:59:03.261 --> 01:59:05.346
Come on,
just go around me!

01:59:08.558 --> 01:59:10.225
Can't you hear me?

01:59:17.734 --> 01:59:20.778
Hey, there. Hi, Trish.

01:59:22.405 --> 01:59:24.907
Man, I'm really sorry
about tonight.

01:59:24.991 --> 01:59:26.408
What's this?

01:59:27.410 --> 01:59:29.078
Those are David's.

01:59:31.164 --> 01:59:32.956
I think he has a problem.

01:59:33.041 --> 01:59:35.542
These are David's?
He's into that.

01:59:35.668 --> 01:59:39.129
David's Boner Jams '03?

01:59:39.756 --> 01:59:41.799
Yeah, it's so sad.

01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:45.302
He compiled all the best
boner scenes, I guess.

01:59:46.221 --> 01:59:48.555
This isn't what it looks like,
okay?

01:59:49.015 --> 01:59:52.142
What does this look like?
A vagina.

01:59:53.186 --> 01:59:54.728
And what do you do
with this vagina?

01:59:54.813 --> 01:59:57.773
To learn.
It's for medicinal purposes.

01:59:57.857 --> 01:59:58.857
Ugh.

01:59:58.942 --> 02:00:01.276
Hey, I'm sorry. God...
What's this?

02:00:01.945 --> 02:00:04.905
This your date drug?
Your roofie?

02:00:05.240 --> 02:00:06.740
It's a Mentos.

02:00:07.492 --> 02:00:09.410
They're "The Freshmaker. "

02:00:09.494 --> 02:00:10.869
Yeah, right.

02:00:11.121 --> 02:00:13.080
What are you,
some kind of sex pervert?

02:00:13.164 --> 02:00:14.498
Are you a deviant
or something?

02:00:14.582 --> 02:00:17.292
No, I'm not a sexual deviant!
What is all this?

02:00:17.377 --> 02:00:19.795
I haven't even tried
to have sex with you, so...

02:00:19.879 --> 02:00:22.798
What are you trying to do? What
are you buttering me up for?

02:00:22.882 --> 02:00:23.966
Come on.

02:00:24.050 --> 02:00:25.801
You're not gonna try
and kill me, are you?

02:00:25.885 --> 02:00:28.554
Look, Trish.
You didn't get a new carpet.

02:00:28.847 --> 02:00:32.141
I'm not trying to kill you.
I love you.

02:00:32.559 --> 02:00:34.977
I love you.
Oh, God!

02:00:35.228 --> 02:00:36.395
Trish.

02:00:44.988 --> 02:00:47.197
Trish. No!

02:00:48.074 --> 02:00:50.617
No. Trish, stop.

02:00:55.123 --> 02:00:56.415
Come on, Trish!

02:00:59.878 --> 02:01:01.795
I need to talk to you!

02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:02.921
No!

02:01:05.091 --> 02:01:06.133
Damn it.

02:01:37.957 --> 02:01:39.291
Oh, my God!

02:01:42.295 --> 02:01:45.172
Andy! Oh, my God!

02:01:45.256 --> 02:01:46.632
Call 911.

02:01:46.799 --> 02:01:48.717
Oh, my... Andy.

02:01:49.511 --> 02:01:51.220
Oh, my God!

02:01:51.304 --> 02:01:54.097
I'm gonna need a minute. I'm
in a lot of pain right now.

02:01:54.182 --> 02:01:55.849
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

02:01:55.934 --> 02:01:57.059
Not bad.

02:01:57.143 --> 02:01:59.520
There were two sides
to that billboard.

02:01:59.604 --> 02:02:01.480
And they both hurt equally.

02:02:01.773 --> 02:02:04.399
Andy. Andy.

02:02:06.486 --> 02:02:08.654
Are you okay?
I'm okay.

02:02:09.155 --> 02:02:10.822
No, I'm not okay.

02:02:12.116 --> 02:02:13.492
I'm a virgin.

02:02:15.662 --> 02:02:16.828
A what?

02:02:17.789 --> 02:02:20.165
I'm a virgin.
I always have been.

02:02:21.543 --> 02:02:24.878
Andy, is that what
all this was about?

02:02:25.838 --> 02:02:27.172
I'm sorry.

02:02:27.257 --> 02:02:29.633
You're just a virgin,
that's all?

02:02:29.759 --> 02:02:32.427
Yeah. That's good. That's a good thing.

02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:36.056
I feel stupid.

02:02:37.725 --> 02:02:40.435
It's okay. I thought
you were trying to kill me.

02:02:42.188 --> 02:02:43.188
No.

02:02:44.065 --> 02:02:45.357
Oh, my God.

02:02:46.442 --> 02:02:49.027
No, I'm not trying
to kill you.

02:02:52.865 --> 02:02:55.534
That's why I never tried
to have sex with you.

02:02:55.952 --> 02:02:58.412
I was scared, okay?
I just...

02:02:59.122 --> 02:03:00.956
'Cause I didn't know
what I was doing.

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:02.874
I just didn't think
it would be good.

02:03:02.959 --> 02:03:05.919
Of course it'll be good.
We love each other.

02:03:07.547 --> 02:03:08.714
Really?

02:03:10.383 --> 02:03:11.717
I love you.

02:03:13.219 --> 02:03:14.386
Yeah.

02:03:19.058 --> 02:03:21.602
Get the fuck out of the road,
virgin!

02:03:23.396 --> 02:03:24.896
Shut up, you fucking jerk!

02:03:24.981 --> 02:03:27.899
No, that's okay.
That's all right. Sorry.

02:03:29.527 --> 02:03:30.611
You know what...

02:03:30.695 --> 02:03:33.488
for so long I thought that there
was something wrong with me...

02:03:33.573 --> 02:03:36.408
because it had
never happened, but...

02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:42.664
I realize now that it was just
because I was waiting for you.

02:04:07.690 --> 02:04:10.442
This was some wedding.
How could they afford it?

02:04:10.526 --> 02:04:13.820
Dude sells his toys and makes
like a half a million dollars.

02:04:13.946 --> 02:04:16.114
It's crazy, right?
That's fucking crazy.

02:04:16.199 --> 02:04:18.158
We're gonna get
some fucking toys.

02:04:18.242 --> 02:04:20.452
We are all so happy for you.

02:04:20.662 --> 02:04:23.413
I am delighted
to say these words.

02:04:24.290 --> 02:04:25.457
Andy...

02:04:26.042 --> 02:04:27.918
you may kiss the bride.

02:04:41.140 --> 02:04:44.309
And for God's sake,
consummate the thing.

02:04:49.273 --> 02:04:52.150
No! Stop it.
I have the key.

02:04:59.033 --> 02:05:01.326
I'm not gonna be done
buffing the marble...

02:05:01.411 --> 02:05:03.078
for about a half an hour,
but...

02:05:03.162 --> 02:05:05.706
you can come in and sit down
if you want...

02:05:05.790 --> 02:05:08.041
or wait in the lobby.
It's okay.

02:05:08.126 --> 02:05:09.626
It's up to you.

02:05:16.801 --> 02:05:19.136
Dude,
get the fuck out of here.

02:05:30.148 --> 02:05:31.648
Ready?
Yeah.

02:05:37.780 --> 02:05:39.156
Yes.
Yeah.

02:05:45.830 --> 02:05:46.830
Whoa.

02:06:50.895 --> 02:06:55.398
And Jupiter aligns with Mars

02:06:56.400 --> 02:07:01.363
Then peace will guide
the planets

02:07:01.739 --> 02:07:04.991
And love
will steer the stars
