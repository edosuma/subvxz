01:17.125 --> 01:21.493
- When is a door not a door?

01:21.526 --> 01:22.858
- Sorry?

01:22.925 --> 01:26.492
- When is a door not a door?

01:29.191 --> 01:30.824
- She doesn't understand.

01:30.891 --> 01:33.057
- Well, it's a riddle.

01:33.124 --> 01:34.557
I think she understands
perfectly.

01:34.624 --> 01:37.557
So I'll ask one more time.

01:37.624 --> 01:41.491
When is a door not a door?

01:41.491 --> 01:43.023
- When it's "ajar."

01:43.090 --> 01:46.490
- Like one of those.

01:46.490 --> 01:49.490
The jar I'm looking for
has a special symbol on it,

01:49.490 --> 01:53.122
a triskelion,
three spirals connected.

01:53.189 --> 01:55.789
- We don't know what
you're talking about.

01:55.855 --> 01:57.222
Maybe you should leave.

01:57.289 --> 01:59.254
- Oh.

01:59.321 --> 02:02.589
It's a very special jar,
actually.

02:02.655 --> 02:04.854
It was made from the wood
of a sacred tree

02:04.921 --> 02:08.921
and used to capture
a dark Kitsune--

02:08.988 --> 02:12.153
a trickster spirit
called Nogitsune.

02:12.220 --> 02:15.688
- Well, all these jars
contain are teas and spices.

02:15.753 --> 02:17.653
- So whatever it is you
came here looking for--

02:17.720 --> 02:20.487
- You know exactly what I came
here looking for, Mr. Dunbar.

02:30.119 --> 02:32.486
You all do.

03:07.483 --> 03:08.382
Hikari!

03:17.948 --> 03:19.147
- No!

03:22.582 --> 03:23.614
- No!

03:26.147 --> 03:27.781
You don't know
what you're doing!

03:27.847 --> 03:31.781
- I've been searching
for this for years.

03:31.847 --> 03:34.213
I know precisely what I'm doing.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.546
- You can't control it.

03:36.613 --> 03:37.513
- I don't want to.

03:47.745 --> 03:51.045
- Set me free.

03:51.112 --> 03:52.912
- Not until
you make me a promise.

03:52.978 --> 03:56.811
- What fool would ask a promise
from a trickster spirit?

03:56.878 --> 03:59.378
- Call it a mutually
beneficial arrangement.

03:59.478 --> 04:02.478
If you're as all powerful and
omniscient as they say.

04:02.478 --> 04:04.910
then you already know
what I want.

04:04.977 --> 04:08.544
- You want retribution

04:08.610 --> 04:11.610
against him,

04:11.677 --> 04:14.943
his friends,

04:15.009 --> 04:19.076
and everyone he loves.

04:19.142 --> 04:22.276
Set me free

04:22.341 --> 04:26.509
and we'll play a new game,

04:26.576 --> 04:28.476
a game of chaos,

04:28.476 --> 04:30.908
strife,

04:30.975 --> 04:34.208
and pain!

04:58.773 --> 04:59.839
- You said it wouldn't bite.

04:59.906 --> 05:01.639
- I said it wouldn't bite me.

05:01.706 --> 05:03.138
But that's also
because I wouldn't

05:03.205 --> 05:07.138
put my hand in front of
the mouth of a frightened dog.

05:07.205 --> 05:08.705
- Thanks for the advice.

05:08.772 --> 05:10.304
You got any idea how we're going
to get it out of there?

05:10.371 --> 05:12.204
- I have someone coming
who has a special talent

05:12.271 --> 05:13.538
for these kinds of things.

05:13.605 --> 05:15.371
He runs the animal shelter
next to my clinic.

05:15.472 --> 05:18.471
Trust me, he's highly qualified.

05:18.537 --> 05:19.937
We even have a nickname for him.

05:20.004 --> 05:21.471
- Oh yeah? What?

05:21.537 --> 05:24.170
- We call him "The Alpha."

05:41.502 --> 05:42.769
- The girl climbed out,

05:42.835 --> 05:44.234
tried to pull it out,
lost her footing,

05:44.301 --> 05:47.734
and ended up falling in too.

05:47.801 --> 05:48.834
Is that all you got?

05:48.901 --> 05:50.168
No protective gear?
No gloves?

05:50.234 --> 05:51.534
- I don't get bit.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.067
Even if I did, I usually
heal pretty fast.

05:54.133 --> 05:57.200
- Well, even so...

05:58.300 --> 05:59.767
- No! He's gonna bite!

06:00.933 --> 06:02.100
- Hey there.

06:02.167 --> 06:03.467
My name is Scott.

06:03.500 --> 06:04.733
I'm going to help
get you guys out of here.

06:29.197 --> 06:30.698
- Scott, hurry! Come on!

06:30.764 --> 06:31.697
Get out of there!

06:42.464 --> 06:43.663
- All right, climb onto me.

06:43.729 --> 06:44.896
Climb onto me.

06:58.062 --> 06:59.962
- Come on, Alicia.

07:00.028 --> 07:01.227
I got you.

07:19.493 --> 07:22.060
- That was close.

07:24.092 --> 07:25.493
Hey, Alicia? You guys?

07:25.560 --> 07:30.592
Let's go see the paramedics, OK?

07:30.659 --> 07:32.459
- What do you guys
call him again?

07:32.459 --> 07:34.091
- The Alpha.

07:34.158 --> 07:36.324
- Right, like a dog.

07:36.459 --> 07:39.258
- No, like a wolf.

08:48.952 --> 08:51.217
- Good boy.

08:51.284 --> 08:53.284
- OK. Come here, buddy.

08:58.117 --> 09:00.151
Do you know why
Cooper bit the lieutenant?

09:00.217 --> 09:01.451
- Because he was scared?

09:01.484 --> 09:02.951
- He was scared for you.

09:03.016 --> 09:06.983
It's one of the best parts
about dogs, they fight for us.

09:07.050 --> 09:10.283
Remember, the same way that we
see them as part of our family,

09:10.349 --> 09:11.816
they see us
as part of their pack.

09:24.214 --> 09:25.615
- There's still time.

09:28.214 --> 09:30.048
- Oh, I know.

09:30.114 --> 09:31.848
Yeah, I'll have kids
one of these days,

09:31.914 --> 09:35.914
after I find someone,
or someone finds me, I guess.

09:35.981 --> 09:40.713
- Yeah, I meant there's still
time to beat traffic.

09:40.780 --> 09:45.513
But if you want to talk,
there's still time for that too.

09:45.580 --> 09:49.879
- I think I was just,
maybe feeling kind of, uh--

09:49.946 --> 09:51.447
- Wistful.

09:53.447 --> 09:56.979
It means a kind of
longing or regret,

09:57.046 --> 09:59.446
a sort of melancholy
about the past

09:59.512 --> 10:01.479
and the choices we've made.

10:04.211 --> 10:06.377
- Wistful.

10:06.445 --> 10:08.845
- Why don't you lock up?
I'll get my stuff.

10:25.909 --> 10:27.309
I didn't see him.

10:27.376 --> 10:29.342
I took my eyes off the road
for, like, two seconds!

10:29.409 --> 10:30.543
- Quiet!

11:17.605 --> 11:19.071
Oh! Jesus!

11:22.938 --> 11:24.138
Hey.

11:25.638 --> 11:27.638
Shit, dude.

11:27.704 --> 11:29.303
You know you could just
use the front door, right?

11:29.438 --> 11:33.637
- I never use the front door.

11:33.703 --> 11:35.570
Especially when it's not safe.

11:35.637 --> 11:37.703
- Who says it's not safe?

11:43.069 --> 11:44.736
- You're seeing her too.

11:46.436 --> 11:48.436
I mean, I've dreamt about her.

11:48.469 --> 11:50.035
You know, now and then
over the years

11:50.101 --> 11:55.101
I've had images flicker in front
of my eyes like blurry photos.

11:55.168 --> 11:59.435
And then, two weeks ago,
something changed.

11:59.435 --> 12:02.535
Those random images

12:02.601 --> 12:05.700
flickering through
my head got clearer.

12:05.767 --> 12:08.600
I saw flashes of her crying out,

12:08.667 --> 12:10.434
silently screaming in pain,

12:10.434 --> 12:11.434
in agony.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.866
She was suffering.

12:13.933 --> 12:16.199
- Allison.

12:16.266 --> 12:20.433
- But I started seeing her face
more and more.

12:20.466 --> 12:23.533
And then I started
hearing her voice.

12:23.599 --> 12:27.433
And I can hear somebody
whispering to me.

12:27.433 --> 12:28.433
- Whispering what?

12:28.433 --> 12:31.432
- One word, and only one.

12:31.465 --> 12:33.632
I hear it every time I go to
sleep and every time I wake up,

12:33.698 --> 12:36.231
and I only wake up
from nightmares.

12:36.297 --> 12:37.231
- What word?

12:40.264 --> 12:41.464
- Bardo.

12:46.431 --> 12:49.896
Uh, I--I, uh--

12:49.963 --> 12:51.296
I was on the phone the other day
and I was writing down

12:51.430 --> 12:52.630
a client's number.

12:52.696 --> 12:55.596
But instead of the number,
I wrote that.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.429
- Scott, do you know
what bardo is?

13:02.495 --> 13:03.962
- A state between
life and death.

13:04.029 --> 13:05.129
- You and I,
we're both seeing her.

13:05.194 --> 13:07.194
We're both speaking
the same word.

13:07.261 --> 13:08.429
It's not just a dream.

13:08.495 --> 13:10.529
Allison is caught between
life and death.

13:10.595 --> 13:12.628
- It's not that simple.

13:12.694 --> 13:13.994
Bardo is a Tibetan word.

13:14.061 --> 13:15.528
It's a means of
interpreting death

13:15.594 --> 13:16.961
and the movements
of consciousness

13:17.028 --> 13:19.293
between physical states
of being.

13:19.428 --> 13:21.561
It's just a word.

13:21.628 --> 13:22.893
It's a concept.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.560
- Well, that fucking concept
is waking me up

13:24.627 --> 13:26.127
in the middle of the night
in a cold sweat,

13:26.193 --> 13:30.059
telling me my daughter
is still out there!

13:30.126 --> 13:31.593
- She can't be.

13:31.660 --> 13:34.592
I mean, she--
she died in my arms.

13:34.659 --> 13:37.192
I felt her slip away from me.

13:37.259 --> 13:38.526
- I know we all die.

13:38.592 --> 13:41.759
I'm not pretending to know
what happens next.

13:41.826 --> 13:44.758
But if there was something
after this life, some next step,

13:44.825 --> 13:46.426
I don't think she made it.

13:46.491 --> 13:50.058
And I think she's trying to
tell us she never crossed over.

13:51.491 --> 13:53.990
- It's been 15 years.

13:54.057 --> 13:57.425
- Let's say we accept all this.

13:57.458 --> 13:59.557
What can we actually do to help?

13:59.624 --> 14:02.524
- There's a--a--
a ritual of some kind.

14:02.590 --> 14:04.289
I know a few details.

14:04.424 --> 14:07.123
I got a feeling the real answers
are in Beacon Hills.

14:10.423 --> 14:11.556
- OK.

14:11.623 --> 14:13.856
What else can you say
for certain?

14:13.923 --> 14:16.055
- It has to be done by
the next full moon.

14:16.122 --> 14:18.988
And if it's not,
we don't get another chance.

14:20.488 --> 14:21.722
- I'm not sure.

14:21.788 --> 14:25.121
And I'll admit,
I'm a little scared.

14:25.187 --> 14:27.588
We're talking about
dangerous rituals,

14:27.655 --> 14:29.654
thousands of years old.

14:29.721 --> 14:31.254
There are going to
be repercussions.

14:31.321 --> 14:34.154
- So can somebody
just say one thing?

14:34.220 --> 14:37.253
Are we doing this or not?

14:37.320 --> 14:38.853
- Well, the message
was for you, Scott.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.320
It's yours to answer.

14:40.421 --> 14:41.421
- It's more than a message.

14:47.152 --> 14:50.085
This is the sword
that killed her.

14:50.152 --> 14:52.420
Her blood

14:52.486 --> 14:55.419
stained the blade.

14:55.485 --> 14:57.719
- I haven't been to Beacon Hills
in a long time.

15:00.419 --> 15:03.151
- None of us have.

15:03.218 --> 15:05.818
But if you drive out tomorrow,
I can meet you there

15:05.884 --> 15:08.684
by afternoon.

15:08.751 --> 15:10.950
- We're gonna need more help.

15:11.017 --> 15:12.418
- And more answers.

15:15.183 --> 15:18.216
- Yeah, I'm gonna need to find
some old friends.

15:20.617 --> 15:23.517
- Sound energy--
I'm speaking specifically

15:23.583 --> 15:26.149
of the sounds that fill
our acoustic environment.

15:26.216 --> 15:28.315
Our current ability to harness
those sounds,

15:28.416 --> 15:31.115
as not only
a renewable energy source,

15:31.181 --> 15:34.081
but as a green sustainable
electric energy.

15:34.148 --> 15:36.416
- Lydia, I hate to
interrupt you, especially

15:36.449 --> 15:38.981
since you're going full throttle
with this tech shit

15:39.048 --> 15:40.448
that none of us really seem
to understand.

15:40.515 --> 15:42.681
- Thanks for the input, Rick,
and for not interrupting.

15:42.748 --> 15:45.047
- Yeah. Lyd, listen--
- Continuing on,

15:45.114 --> 15:47.547
research into energy harvesting,

15:47.614 --> 15:48.914
up until now--

15:48.980 --> 15:51.014
- Lydia, I just have one tiny,
little question.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.780
Lyd--
- Stop calling me Lyd.

15:52.847 --> 15:54.414
- Lydia!
- Rick.

15:54.414 --> 15:55.813
For someone who hates
to interrupt,

15:55.879 --> 15:58.113
you seem oddly compelled
to keep doing it.

15:58.179 --> 16:01.779
- Look, all I want to know is,
who's Allison?

16:18.777 --> 16:20.911
Lyd.

18:45.664 --> 18:48.198
- Um, hey, Sheriff?

18:48.263 --> 18:49.531
I really hate to bother you.

18:49.598 --> 18:51.431
I just got a phone call
from Deputy Parrish.

18:51.498 --> 18:55.398
He wants to talk to our...
consultant.

18:55.464 --> 18:57.697
- Another incident
at the auto shop?

18:57.763 --> 18:59.830
- His son definitely has

18:59.897 --> 19:01.930
an unhealthy fixation
on that Jeep.

19:03.129 --> 19:04.196
- Do you want me to tell him?

19:04.262 --> 19:07.262
- Nah.
He better hear it from me.

19:14.496 --> 19:16.161
- You were right.

19:16.228 --> 19:17.628
It wasn't gasoline.

19:17.695 --> 19:19.995
Whoever set this fire used
a chemical accelerant.

19:20.061 --> 19:21.795
- Four fires in two weeks.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.761
That's a serial arsonist.

19:23.828 --> 19:25.495
Do I need to call in the FBI?

19:25.561 --> 19:28.094
- Well, maybe you should be
calling your son.

19:28.160 --> 19:29.694
Trust me, right now Stiles
has his own fires

19:29.760 --> 19:31.394
to put out.

19:31.394 --> 19:32.894
I think we can handle
one arsonist.

19:32.960 --> 19:35.560
- The only thing I'd say is,
this one seems to have a plan.

19:41.826 --> 19:43.959
You need to get that?

19:44.026 --> 19:46.559
- Yeah.
- No.

19:46.626 --> 19:48.626
- It--it can--it can wait.

19:48.693 --> 19:49.825
- Mm-hmm.

19:53.558 --> 19:56.291
- You want me to answer it?
- No.

19:56.392 --> 19:59.525
- Why do I have a feeling
that that's about me?

19:59.592 --> 20:01.458
Or maybe my son?

20:03.191 --> 20:05.323
He still seems pretty intent
on leaving high school

20:05.391 --> 20:07.424
with a grand theft auto charge.

20:10.190 --> 20:11.491
- He took the Jeep again,
didn't he?

20:11.557 --> 20:14.256
- Why the hell does he keep
taking the Jeep?

20:14.323 --> 20:15.790
- Because he knows I hate it.

20:34.054 --> 20:36.054
- What the--

20:42.020 --> 20:44.020
I'm not paying for those.

20:44.087 --> 20:45.987
- Oh, yes, you are.

20:49.920 --> 20:51.387
- What's up, guys?

21:49.682 --> 21:51.181
- I--I can't--

21:51.247 --> 21:52.415
I can't take your pain.

21:52.482 --> 21:55.281
- That's because
it doesn't hurt.

22:14.845 --> 22:17.512
- Hey, thanks for coming
so fast.

22:17.579 --> 22:18.645
Yeah.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.445
Hey.

22:31.078 --> 22:34.578
- Do you really think
all this is true?

22:34.644 --> 22:37.010
Allison being stuck,

22:37.077 --> 22:40.043
unable to cross over?

22:40.110 --> 22:41.510
- I don't know.

22:43.877 --> 22:47.676
But if being here and doing
this thing actually helps her,

22:47.742 --> 22:50.109
and no one else gets hurt,

22:50.176 --> 22:53.376
I'm up for trying.

22:53.442 --> 22:55.175
- OK.

22:55.241 --> 22:57.642
Then let's try.

23:03.741 --> 23:08.107
We need a handful of earth from
the ground where Allison died.

23:08.174 --> 23:10.074
- OK.
- OK.

24:03.802 --> 24:04.735
What's next?

24:19.468 --> 24:20.768
- Anybody mind if
we close this thing?

24:20.834 --> 24:21.768
- Yeah.

24:24.967 --> 24:27.501
Does your, uh,

24:27.568 --> 24:30.533
mom know that you're here?

24:30.600 --> 24:31.900
- Does she know that
you're here?

24:31.967 --> 24:33.166
- No.

24:33.232 --> 24:35.367
And I kind of want to
keep it that way.

24:35.367 --> 24:36.467
- Yeah, me too.

24:38.966 --> 24:40.232
- All right.

24:40.367 --> 24:41.367
Lydia, we've got the earth
where she died,

24:41.432 --> 24:42.599
the weapon that took her life.

24:42.666 --> 24:44.832
According to you,
that's steps one and two.

24:44.899 --> 24:46.366
What is next?

24:46.366 --> 24:51.898
- I was, uh, hoping you could
help me figure that out.

24:51.965 --> 24:54.165
I mean, to be honest,
I'm a little out of practice

24:54.231 --> 24:56.398
with all of this.

24:56.465 --> 24:58.830
- You still scream like
a banshee, right?

24:58.897 --> 25:01.197
- Not quite like I used to.

25:01.264 --> 25:02.398
It's just like a muscle.

25:02.465 --> 25:05.464
You stop using it,
and it atrophies.

25:05.530 --> 25:07.597
- Why did you stop
using your power?

25:07.664 --> 25:09.397
- Stiles.

25:09.464 --> 25:12.229
Obviously it has something
to do with Stiles.

25:14.229 --> 25:15.363
- Why is Jackson here?

25:17.896 --> 25:20.128
What are you doing?

25:20.195 --> 25:22.995
- Well, firstly,
Jackson prefers not

25:23.062 --> 25:25.695
to be talked about
like he's not in the room.

25:25.762 --> 25:30.161
Second, well, Lydia called,
begging me to help, as usual.

25:30.227 --> 25:32.362
And I said, OK,

25:32.362 --> 25:34.227
so long as she promised
never to tell Ethan,

25:34.362 --> 25:35.827
because I promised Ethan
that I would never

25:35.894 --> 25:38.194
come back to this nightmare
hellscape of a town.

25:38.261 --> 25:40.260
- Thank you.

25:40.361 --> 25:42.494
- Oh, I love these games.

25:44.993 --> 25:46.560
- This isn't a game.

25:46.626 --> 25:50.660
- I have claws that
drip paralytic venom,

25:50.726 --> 25:52.526
and a tail that'll
snap your neck.

25:52.593 --> 25:55.192
So take your hand
off of me, old man.

26:20.857 --> 26:21.990
Oh.

26:34.922 --> 26:36.356
It's a tree.

26:36.422 --> 26:37.988
- It's not just a tree.

26:38.055 --> 26:39.988
- It's the Sacred Grove.

26:40.055 --> 26:43.588
- The ancients Druids
call it a nemeton.

26:43.655 --> 26:45.821
Well, it looks like a tree.

27:13.985 --> 27:15.085
- All right.

27:15.152 --> 27:16.885
Can we just--

27:16.952 --> 27:18.418
can we just stop
before either of us

27:18.485 --> 27:19.918
does anything
completely embarrassing?

27:19.985 --> 27:23.385
- I think that qualifies
as pretty embarrassing.

27:23.452 --> 27:24.751
- It was coming loose anyway.

27:24.817 --> 27:26.217
- Are you gonna punish me
or not?

27:26.352 --> 27:28.351
Cause otherwise,
I'll just go to my room.

27:28.384 --> 27:30.216
- Eli, I don't--
I don't want to punish you.

27:30.351 --> 27:32.484
I'd like to maybe understand
what you think you were doing.

27:32.551 --> 27:34.551
- I needed a ride to meet
my friends after the game.

27:34.617 --> 27:36.250
What is wrong with that?

27:36.351 --> 27:37.816
- You're 15,
you don't have a license,

27:37.883 --> 27:39.150
and it's called
breaking the law.

27:39.216 --> 27:41.016
- You never broke the law?

27:41.083 --> 27:42.416
- OK. You know what?

27:42.483 --> 27:43.816
If this is about
the other thing,

27:43.883 --> 27:45.182
then let's talk about
the other thing.

27:45.249 --> 27:46.583
- I don't want to talk to you
about anything.

27:46.650 --> 27:47.915
- I wouldn't push it
if it wasn't a thing.

27:47.982 --> 27:49.715
But we both know
it's not just anything,

27:49.782 --> 27:51.449
and now it's
definitely something.

27:51.515 --> 27:53.049
- I don't even know what
you're talking about.

27:53.115 --> 27:54.349
Are you listening to yourself?

27:54.382 --> 27:55.549
You sound drunk.

27:55.615 --> 27:57.714
- I can't get drunk.
You know that.

27:57.781 --> 27:59.881
- It's not my problem.
- Eli, it's a thing!

27:59.948 --> 28:01.214
OK, to you, not me.

28:01.349 --> 28:02.248
- I can teach you.

28:02.348 --> 28:03.481
- What if I don't want to learn?

28:03.548 --> 28:04.548
- Well, you're gonna
have to learn.

28:04.614 --> 28:06.047
It's who you are.
You're a Hale.

28:06.113 --> 28:07.514
- I'll change my name.

28:07.581 --> 28:09.080
- That won't change the fact
that you're a werewolf!

28:09.147 --> 28:10.514
- And what if I'm not?

28:12.480 --> 28:14.880
Maybe that's why
I can't turn into one?

28:14.947 --> 28:17.347
You know, what if I'm
the first ever Hale

28:17.380 --> 28:18.912
not to turn into a werewolf?

28:22.979 --> 28:24.246
- To be honest,

28:24.346 --> 28:26.412
it would probably make
life a little easier.

28:26.479 --> 28:28.911
- Yeah, for me?

28:28.978 --> 28:30.011
Or you?

28:45.378 --> 28:46.977
- Definitely me.

29:21.641 --> 29:23.206
- You're trespassing.

29:26.073 --> 29:27.073
- You're naked.

29:29.940 --> 29:31.206
- You're not.

29:37.406 --> 29:39.705
- Better?

29:55.170 --> 29:57.771
- Eli, come on out.

29:57.838 --> 30:01.003
I was thinking we could
practice before the game.

30:01.070 --> 30:03.338
You know, basketball was
really always more my thing.

30:03.403 --> 30:05.970
But, uh, I think
I'm getting better.

30:06.037 --> 30:08.503
Maybe you can show me
some tricks?

30:21.001 --> 30:22.101
Or maybe not.

30:55.732 --> 30:57.565
- You're giving me
that look again.

30:57.632 --> 30:59.565
- What look?
- The look.

30:59.632 --> 31:00.732
- What are you talking about?
There's no look.

31:00.798 --> 31:02.632
- There's a look.
- What look?

31:02.698 --> 31:05.764
- The relationship look.

31:05.831 --> 31:08.398
- Oh.
- Yeah, that look.

31:08.465 --> 31:10.431
- Did I say anything?

31:10.497 --> 31:13.431
- You said it with a look.

31:13.497 --> 31:15.364
And I'm not changing my mind.

31:15.431 --> 31:17.163
- And I'm not asking you to.

31:17.230 --> 31:18.230
- OK.

31:20.063 --> 31:21.063
But your look is.

31:21.130 --> 31:22.663
- All right.

31:25.530 --> 31:28.330
But, since we're
talking about it--

31:30.330 --> 31:31.829
Sorry.

31:36.662 --> 31:38.028
I got to go.

31:50.927 --> 31:52.428
- What are you doing here?

31:52.494 --> 31:53.593
- Looking for answers.

31:56.060 --> 31:59.827
And I'm wondering if you've made
any recent trips to Japan.

32:17.758 --> 32:20.190
- Oh, for the love of God.
Come on.

32:28.857 --> 32:30.757
- Oh! I missed you!

32:30.824 --> 32:32.390
- I missed you too.
- No, you didn't.

32:32.457 --> 32:33.690
- OK. I wanted to.

32:33.757 --> 32:35.324
- Well, that I can believe.

32:36.756 --> 32:38.856
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:42.623 --> 32:44.155
- It's good to see you.

32:44.222 --> 32:46.623
- It's kind of awkward
to see you.

32:46.688 --> 32:48.456
- I know.

32:48.522 --> 32:49.988
- OK!

32:50.055 --> 32:52.187
Let's go find a tree
in the woods.

33:01.354 --> 33:02.787
Come on.

33:02.854 --> 33:04.321
You said we need to find
this thing by nightfall.

33:10.953 --> 33:14.420
- I haven't been to Japan
in years.

33:14.486 --> 33:15.686
- Are you sure about that?

33:15.753 --> 33:17.219
- Positive.

33:17.320 --> 33:19.819
How long has it been since
you were in Beacon Hills?

33:19.885 --> 33:21.052
Because I seem to remember
you telling us that

33:21.119 --> 33:22.985
you were going to stay
in Los Angeles.

33:23.052 --> 33:25.752
- I was, but I wanted to ask you
another question.

33:25.819 --> 33:30.385
And it, um, it might
sound a little strange.

33:30.452 --> 33:34.218
You walk into a room
that contains a match,

33:34.319 --> 33:38.351
a kerosene lamp,
a candle, and a fireplace.

33:38.418 --> 33:40.017
What would you light first?

33:40.083 --> 33:41.217
- The match.

33:43.183 --> 33:45.717
You came all this way to
Beacon Hills to ask me that?

33:45.783 --> 33:48.450
- I do have another question.

33:48.517 --> 33:50.982
What has to be broken
before it can be used?

33:51.049 --> 33:53.682
- An egg.

33:53.749 --> 33:56.317
- I'm tall when I'm young,

33:56.382 --> 33:58.649
and I'm short when I'm old.

33:58.716 --> 34:02.316
What am I?
- A candle.

34:02.349 --> 34:04.582
Do you want to talk
about that bullet,

34:04.648 --> 34:06.848
or you want to keep
asking me children's riddles?

34:06.915 --> 34:08.715
- What month of the year
has 28 days?

34:08.781 --> 34:11.315
- All of them.

34:11.315 --> 34:12.715
- What has many keys--

34:12.781 --> 34:14.648
- Stop.

34:14.714 --> 34:16.381
Stop talking.

34:16.448 --> 34:19.814
- What has many keys
yet opens no locks?

34:19.880 --> 34:21.146
- A piano.

34:21.213 --> 34:23.079
- What has many teeth
but cannot bite?

34:23.146 --> 34:24.780
- A comb.

34:29.446 --> 34:31.713
- What is always in front of you
but can never be seen?

34:31.779 --> 34:34.178
- The future.

34:34.313 --> 34:36.713
- The more of this there is,
the less you can see.

34:36.778 --> 34:39.778
What is it?

34:39.845 --> 34:42.312
- Darkness, you motherfucker!

35:06.576 --> 35:07.643
- It's me.

35:07.710 --> 35:09.310
Um, hey, we're still looking.

35:09.376 --> 35:13.209
Just getting a little worried
about meeting up on time.

35:13.310 --> 35:17.309
So just give me a call
or text, anything.

35:19.542 --> 35:21.774
Mm.

35:21.841 --> 35:23.475
OK.

35:28.808 --> 35:30.173
Ah!

35:30.308 --> 35:31.441
It's this way.

35:31.508 --> 35:32.641
It's this way.

35:38.973 --> 35:42.039
- What is it?

35:42.106 --> 35:43.340
- Someone's following us.

35:46.706 --> 35:49.406
They've been following us
pretty much the whole time.

35:49.472 --> 35:51.105
- Who?

35:53.971 --> 35:55.071
- Here, come here!

35:55.138 --> 35:56.306
- Wait, wait,
I wasn't doing anything!

35:56.306 --> 35:57.372
Sorry!

35:57.439 --> 35:58.671
Uh.

35:58.738 --> 36:00.671
- It is you.

36:00.738 --> 36:03.004
- Eli, Derek's son.

36:03.070 --> 36:04.538
- Wow, you've gotten really big.

36:04.605 --> 36:06.104
- Yeah, It's probably
because I was only three

36:06.170 --> 36:07.770
the last time you saw me.

36:07.837 --> 36:09.371
- What are you doing out here?

36:09.437 --> 36:11.404
- I was kind of wondering what
you guys were doing out here.

36:11.470 --> 36:12.637
- Hiking.

36:12.704 --> 36:13.870
Can't you tell?

36:13.937 --> 36:15.136
It's a really nice night
for hiking.

36:15.203 --> 36:16.537
- I know what
you're looking for.

36:16.604 --> 36:17.836
The tree, right?

36:17.903 --> 36:19.203
That huge stump's that's
like 20-feet wide?

36:19.304 --> 36:20.936
- You know how to find it?

36:21.003 --> 36:22.503
- Kind of.

36:22.569 --> 36:23.703
I sleepwalk.

36:23.769 --> 36:25.135
I don't know why.

36:25.202 --> 36:26.835
But I've just been doing it
for the last few months.

36:26.902 --> 36:28.702
- I used to wake up
in the woods too.

36:28.768 --> 36:30.835
- After you were bit
by Peter, right?

36:30.902 --> 36:32.568
- Yeah, your dad tell you
a few stories?

36:32.635 --> 36:33.802
- Yeah, all of 'em.

36:33.868 --> 36:35.702
- What about the tree?

36:35.768 --> 36:36.967
- It's not far from here.

36:37.034 --> 36:38.134
- I knew we were going
the right way.

36:38.201 --> 36:39.302
- No, you were going
the wrong way.

36:39.368 --> 36:41.134
It's that way.
- We were circling back.

36:41.201 --> 36:42.734
- Hm.
- Thank you.

36:42.801 --> 36:43.801
- Well, I can help you find it.

36:43.867 --> 36:45.867
- Got it.
- Hey, come on.

36:52.566 --> 36:54.600
- What are you doing?

37:00.832 --> 37:03.466
- So aren't you the screamer?

37:03.532 --> 37:04.799
- Banshee.

37:04.865 --> 37:06.332
- Yeah, but banshees scream,
right?

37:06.399 --> 37:09.765
- Well, they wail if you want
to get technical, but yes.

37:09.832 --> 37:11.164
- So how loud can you scream?

37:11.299 --> 37:12.998
Loud enough to create a burst
of acoustic energy

37:13.064 --> 37:15.098
that could crush your skull.

37:15.164 --> 37:17.498
- Good to know.

37:17.564 --> 37:19.898
- There it is.

37:19.964 --> 37:22.331
OK. OK.

37:23.997 --> 37:25.331
So what should we do
about Argent?

37:25.398 --> 37:28.763
- Uh, I mean, I'm never
gonna get a signal now.

37:28.830 --> 37:30.063
Even if he's texting me,
I wouldn't know.

37:30.129 --> 37:31.663
- Well, we're going to
have to do this now.

37:31.730 --> 37:32.896
We can't wait for him.

37:32.962 --> 37:34.196
- It's his daughter.

37:34.297 --> 37:35.996
- You said it has to be tonight.

37:36.062 --> 37:37.996
He would want us to do this
without him.

37:40.729 --> 37:42.362
Don't you have something to do?

37:42.429 --> 37:43.496
- Yeah.

37:43.562 --> 37:44.995
Yeah, I have a lacrosse game
to play.

37:45.061 --> 37:46.462
Well, more like a lacrosse
game to show up to

37:46.529 --> 37:49.296
since I, like,
I never get to play.

37:51.928 --> 37:53.428
Oh! You want me to leave?

37:53.495 --> 37:55.595
OK. Uh, I got it.

37:55.661 --> 37:57.528
OK, well, I'll tell my dad
that I saw you guys?

37:57.595 --> 37:59.594
- No, don't.

37:59.660 --> 38:00.760
Don't tell him anything.

38:00.827 --> 38:04.193
This is kind of--
- Personal.

38:04.294 --> 38:05.794
- All right. Don't worry.

38:05.860 --> 38:07.926
I won't say anything.

38:18.792 --> 38:19.825
- All right.

38:19.892 --> 38:21.492
Now what?

38:23.992 --> 38:25.658
- OK.

38:29.924 --> 38:32.791
Why are you looking at me?

38:32.857 --> 38:34.424
I didn't write the instructions.

38:34.491 --> 38:35.824
- Yeah, you did.

38:35.891 --> 38:37.324
You literally wrote
the instructions.

38:37.391 --> 38:39.123
Okay, you know what I mean.

38:47.656 --> 38:48.923
- Do you feel that?

38:48.989 --> 38:50.656
Yeah.

39:10.554 --> 39:12.987
- What the hell?

39:13.053 --> 39:14.787
Uh...

39:41.951 --> 39:43.018
- OK.

39:43.085 --> 39:44.418
That was fun.

39:44.485 --> 39:46.017
Um, you guys want to go
get something to eat now?

39:56.717 --> 39:59.016
- I know.

40:17.482 --> 40:19.047
- Hey, guys.

40:44.945 --> 40:46.179
It's Allison.

40:54.044 --> 40:56.078
She's alive.

41:05.943 --> 41:07.810
This can't be real.

41:07.877 --> 41:08.943
It can't be her.

41:09.010 --> 41:10.177
She was cremated.

41:10.277 --> 41:11.510
- She looks pretty
un-cremated to me.

41:11.577 --> 41:12.943
- She's not just un-cremated.

41:13.009 --> 41:15.277
She's literally been
reconstituted out of thin air.

41:15.277 --> 41:18.142
- So that wasn't in
the instructions?

41:20.742 --> 41:22.442
I got a question.

41:22.509 --> 41:24.542
What do we do when she wakes up?

41:24.609 --> 41:26.276
- If she wakes up.

41:31.141 --> 41:33.575
We need some help.

41:35.074 --> 41:36.308
- Mom, we got a problem.

41:40.174 --> 41:43.140
- She looks just like Allison.

41:43.274 --> 41:46.973
Why, Scott, does she look
exactly like Allison?

41:47.039 --> 41:48.607
- You really want to know?

41:48.674 --> 41:50.906
- Just get her inside.

41:50.973 --> 41:52.639
OK.

42:37.635 --> 42:41.902
- Chaos!

42:41.969 --> 42:46.001
Strife!

42:46.068 --> 42:48.868
Pain!

42:54.634 --> 42:55.733
- Listen up!

42:55.800 --> 42:59.167
Tonight's game
is not just a game.

42:59.268 --> 43:01.533
This is a preamble
to what comes tomorrow,

43:01.600 --> 43:06.633
an overture to a symphony
of victory!

43:06.700 --> 43:09.333
This tournament
is everything I've dreamed of

43:09.400 --> 43:11.267
my entire career
as a lacrosse coach.

43:11.300 --> 43:13.899
And that trophy is
going right here, boys.

43:13.966 --> 43:16.898
And I know none of you
will ruin it for me

43:16.965 --> 43:19.266
by losing this game tonight!

43:19.266 --> 43:20.332
Am I right?

43:20.399 --> 43:22.798
all: Yes, Coach!

43:22.865 --> 43:23.931
- Oh.

43:23.998 --> 43:24.998
It's just you.

43:25.065 --> 43:26.831
- Just me.

43:26.898 --> 43:28.764
But I'm here, with him.

43:32.930 --> 43:34.330
- We can talk about it later.

43:34.397 --> 43:35.564
I came to watch you play.

43:35.630 --> 43:36.864
- Well, prepare for
disappointment,

43:36.930 --> 43:40.896
'cause if you didn't notice,
I never play.

43:40.963 --> 43:43.929
- I noticed, and I'm going to
talk to your coach about it.

43:43.996 --> 43:45.264
- Oh, God, no! No, no!

43:45.296 --> 43:48.429
- Hey, Coach, can I have a word?
- Don't do that.

43:48.496 --> 43:51.995
- Eli,
you probably got the feeling

43:52.062 --> 43:54.396
that I'm not actually here
to watch your game.

43:54.462 --> 43:56.628
Yeah?
- Kinda.

43:56.695 --> 44:00.362
- And that maybe I'm here to
give my good friend, your dad,

44:00.428 --> 44:02.495
just a little support as
he deals with

44:02.562 --> 44:05.262
his somewhat delinquent son.

44:05.295 --> 44:06.262
- Maybe.

44:06.328 --> 44:07.927
- But I'm not.

44:07.994 --> 44:09.094
I'm here to warn you.

44:09.160 --> 44:10.361
You steal that Jeep again,

44:10.427 --> 44:12.294
I'm going to haul your ass
into a jail cell,

44:12.361 --> 44:13.793
have you tried as an adult,

44:13.860 --> 44:15.860
and watch you get sent
to the state penitentiary

44:15.926 --> 44:18.326
for a minimum of 90 days.

44:20.260 --> 44:22.326
- Did he tell you to scare me?

44:23.260 --> 44:24.626
- Maybe.

44:24.693 --> 44:26.559
Good luck with the game, Eli.

44:26.625 --> 44:27.925
Yeah.

44:34.792 --> 44:36.359
What do you think about my son
getting a little playing time

44:36.425 --> 44:38.425
tonight?
- I think that's a great idea.

44:38.491 --> 44:39.624
- You don't know who my son is,
do you?

44:39.691 --> 44:41.158
- I don't know who you are.

44:41.258 --> 44:44.890
But you look pretty athletic,

44:44.957 --> 44:47.723
so I'm guessing your son is too.

44:47.790 --> 44:49.823
- That's my son.

44:52.257 --> 44:53.423
- I was wrong.

44:53.490 --> 44:55.122
- Just give him five minutes
in the game.

44:55.257 --> 44:56.257
Let him prove himself.

44:56.290 --> 44:57.657
- Three minutes
if we're winning.

44:57.723 --> 44:59.290
- Five minutes.
- OK.

44:59.357 --> 45:00.622
You know what?
You drive a tough bargain.

45:00.689 --> 45:03.356
Three it is!
- Coach.

45:03.422 --> 45:05.456
- Four minutes!

45:05.522 --> 45:07.988
Not a second longer.

45:12.088 --> 45:14.588
What about four and 1/2?

45:16.955 --> 45:18.288
- I checked her vitals.

45:18.355 --> 45:21.154
Everything's normal,
at least normal for a woman

45:21.255 --> 45:24.255
who's been dead for 15 years.

45:24.321 --> 45:25.554
- Maybe we should cut her open

45:25.620 --> 45:27.454
and then see
if she's normal inside.

45:27.520 --> 45:29.254
- Not exactly how medical
treatment works.

45:29.287 --> 45:30.554
But thanks for the suggestion.

45:30.620 --> 45:31.853
- How do we know she's OK?

45:31.919 --> 45:35.553
I mean, not just physically
but mentally?

45:35.619 --> 45:37.419
- How do we know
this is Allison?

45:37.486 --> 45:39.253
Hm? Really Allison?

45:39.253 --> 45:41.152
- We don't.

45:41.253 --> 45:43.486
This wasn't exactly part
of the plan.

45:43.553 --> 45:47.585
- Maybe our first step is
simply talking with her.

45:47.652 --> 45:50.285
Since she doesn't appear
to be injured,

45:50.352 --> 45:53.518
we're probably OK
to try waking her up.

45:53.585 --> 45:56.484
- Mom?
- Yeah.

45:56.551 --> 45:58.517
I think she's awake.

46:19.982 --> 46:22.415
- Our sons are trained
to be soldiers,

46:22.482 --> 46:26.482
daughters to be leaders.

46:26.549 --> 46:29.148
- Shapeshifter, lycan,

46:29.249 --> 46:32.748
werewolf,

46:32.814 --> 46:35.913
to me it's just
another dumb animal.

46:55.979 --> 46:57.246
- Allison.

46:57.279 --> 46:59.945
Allison.

47:00.011 --> 47:02.011
Allison?

47:02.078 --> 47:03.711
- Where the hell does
she think she's going?

47:03.778 --> 47:05.278
- She's probably
slightly confused.

47:05.345 --> 47:06.578
- Supposed to be slightly dead.

47:06.645 --> 47:08.977
- Split up.
If you find her, yell.

47:09.844 --> 47:11.545
OK.

47:18.044 --> 47:19.143
- Got her!

47:21.076 --> 47:22.644
Ah.

47:22.709 --> 47:24.244
- Hey, Allison!

47:24.277 --> 47:25.576
You OK?

47:25.643 --> 47:26.976
- Not me, man.

47:44.242 --> 47:45.674
- Shit.

47:47.141 --> 47:48.707
Hey, Allison, wait!

47:54.241 --> 47:55.840
Whoa!

48:09.440 --> 48:11.240
Who are you?

48:11.240 --> 48:13.505
- It's me. It's Scott.

48:13.572 --> 48:15.505
- Scott who?

48:15.572 --> 48:18.239
- McCall.

48:18.239 --> 48:19.904
- Where's the alpha?

48:19.971 --> 48:20.738
- You mean?

48:20.804 --> 48:23.138
- Where's Derek Hale?

48:54.601 --> 48:56.468
- Wait!

48:58.401 --> 49:02.235
- Hey.
Allison, she's alive.

49:02.301 --> 49:03.535
She's back.

49:03.600 --> 49:05.067
- She's not the only one.

49:12.400 --> 49:15.033
- Levchenko,
did you call the power company?

49:15.099 --> 49:16.334
- I just did.

49:16.400 --> 49:17.899
They said everything
is fine on their end.

49:17.966 --> 49:18.866
- Huh.
- Might be an

49:18.933 --> 49:20.433
electrical issue here.

49:20.499 --> 49:21.998
- Sheriff,
we got another problem

49:22.065 --> 49:23.798
that you might want to handle
first.

49:23.865 --> 49:30.432
- If it's another fire,
I don't want to hear about it.

49:30.498 --> 49:32.465
Of course I want
to hear about it!

49:32.532 --> 49:35.131
Get the hell in here,
both of you!

49:35.232 --> 49:37.631
- 20 minutes ago, two hikers
were headed down the trails

49:37.697 --> 49:39.431
and they spotted smoke.

49:39.497 --> 49:40.864
- We've got another witness
who said

49:40.931 --> 49:42.264
they passed by someone
wearing a heavy black coat,

49:42.331 --> 49:44.564
but couldn't see his face
because of a hood.

49:44.631 --> 49:45.631
- OK.

49:45.697 --> 49:46.796
Levchenko, you're with me.

49:46.863 --> 49:49.030
Hewitt, you're with Parrish.

49:49.096 --> 49:51.763
Let's go.

49:51.830 --> 49:53.696
Is that a new uniform?

51:01.923 --> 51:04.823
- How'd you get in here?

51:04.889 --> 51:09.623
- The door was ajar.

51:09.689 --> 51:10.923
- Who are you?

51:10.989 --> 51:14.922
- Someone who knows you

51:14.988 --> 51:17.622
better than you know yourself.

51:17.688 --> 51:19.355
- Hands up where I can see 'em!

51:33.854 --> 51:36.721
- You are kitsune,

51:36.786 --> 51:39.086
but you don't know it.

51:40.620 --> 51:45.720
Your brother, Ekaida,
he knew it,

51:45.786 --> 51:48.420
but he never told you.

51:48.486 --> 51:51.353
- How do you know
about my brother?

51:51.420 --> 51:56.452
- The spirit in you, it's old.

51:56.519 --> 52:00.684
It's drawn to Beacon Hills.

52:00.751 --> 52:03.252
- Don't come any closer!

52:03.319 --> 52:07.018
- The power,

52:07.083 --> 52:09.950
it's like an armor
protecting you.

52:10.017 --> 52:13.650
But it cannot protect you now!

52:18.483 --> 52:19.683
- Ah!

52:22.517 --> 52:24.116
Ah. Oh!

52:24.217 --> 52:26.082
Oh!

52:26.217 --> 52:29.048
- There it is.

52:29.115 --> 52:32.282
I don't want your life,
little fox.

52:32.349 --> 52:34.615
- Oh. Ah.

52:34.681 --> 52:37.881
- But I do want your tail.

52:37.948 --> 52:40.515
You have nine tails

52:40.581 --> 52:42.814
that can summon nine Oni.

52:44.315 --> 52:46.248
- Now

52:46.315 --> 52:50.380
give them to me!

52:50.447 --> 52:52.247
- Scott.
- Yeah.

52:52.314 --> 52:53.714
- We don't know where she's
going or what she's doing.

52:53.780 --> 52:55.214
- Or how the hell she's alive.

52:55.280 --> 52:57.046
- Well, can we answer that
question after we find her?

52:57.113 --> 52:58.713
- That woman may look
like Allison,

52:58.779 --> 53:00.413
but it doesn't mean
that she is Allison.

53:00.479 --> 53:01.879
- She didn't recognize me.

53:01.946 --> 53:04.279
- Me either.

53:04.346 --> 53:05.313
But she saw me heal.

53:05.379 --> 53:06.845
She knows what I am.

53:06.912 --> 53:09.246
- So she doesn't remember us but
she knows about werewolves.

53:09.313 --> 53:10.945
It's frighteningly convenient
for a werewolf hunter

53:11.012 --> 53:14.111
who just got brought back
to life.

53:14.212 --> 53:16.412
- She also knew how to kick ass,

53:16.478 --> 53:17.744
specifically my ass.

53:17.811 --> 53:19.011
- Hold on.

53:19.077 --> 53:20.644
When I told her
my last name was McCall,

53:20.711 --> 53:22.444
she looked at me like she...

53:22.511 --> 53:23.777
was expecting something else.

53:23.844 --> 53:25.577
- Hale.

53:25.644 --> 53:27.377
But if the only thing
that she remembers right now

53:27.444 --> 53:29.743
is that she hunts
and kills werewolves--

53:29.810 --> 53:31.277
- Then we need to find Derek.

53:31.344 --> 53:32.476
- I'm coming with you.

53:32.543 --> 53:33.976
OK.

53:55.441 --> 53:58.374
- Allison.

54:13.373 --> 54:14.407
- Who are you?

54:14.473 --> 54:16.972
A friend,

54:17.039 --> 54:21.206
despite appearances.

54:22.805 --> 54:27.771
A friend with a fondness
for...

54:27.838 --> 54:30.671
riddles.

54:30.738 --> 54:32.705
- I don't remember
liking riddles.

54:32.771 --> 54:36.937
- Oh, you'll like this one.

54:37.004 --> 54:41.437
What's another word
for the metal silver,

54:41.504 --> 54:46.036
and also the name
of a legendary family

54:46.103 --> 54:50.703
who hunts werewolves?

54:50.769 --> 54:52.269
- Argent.

54:52.336 --> 54:58.203
- Allison Argent.

54:58.269 --> 55:01.203
Time to hunt.

55:01.269 --> 55:05.835
Time to kill Scott McCall,

55:05.901 --> 55:09.834
the werewolf
who destroyed your family.

55:09.901 --> 55:11.368
- I don't remember that name.

55:11.434 --> 55:14.267
- Oh, you will.

55:14.334 --> 55:16.100
We will help you.

55:16.201 --> 55:17.900
- I don't fucking trust you.

55:17.966 --> 55:19.900
- You would trust your mother,
wouldn't you?

55:24.266 --> 55:27.366
- You're not my mother.

55:27.433 --> 55:29.099
- But aren't I precisely
the voice

55:29.200 --> 55:30.665
you need to hear right now?

55:30.732 --> 55:33.499
- No, my mother's dead.

55:33.565 --> 55:36.732
- No. No.

55:36.799 --> 55:39.031
- That's why I'm here.

55:39.098 --> 55:42.064
- Our side has suffered
so many losses.

55:42.199 --> 55:48.964
Allison, you have to remember
Scott McCall, Derek Hale.

55:49.030 --> 55:51.498
Those men,
those monsters have murdered

55:51.564 --> 55:53.030
so many innocent people.

55:53.097 --> 55:54.830
They have to be stopped.

55:57.198 --> 55:59.963
- What do you want me to do?

56:00.029 --> 56:03.630
- The betas make the alpha
stronger.

56:03.696 --> 56:05.696
- So I take out
the weakest members first?

56:05.762 --> 56:08.629
- Scott McCall has too many
allies right now.

56:08.696 --> 56:10.096
- So how do I get to him?

56:10.196 --> 56:12.961
- The Oni will clear a path.

56:13.028 --> 56:16.296
They will clear the board
of the other pieces,

56:16.362 --> 56:21.228
leaving you to concentrate
on a winning move.

56:21.295 --> 56:23.994
- What's the winning move?

56:24.060 --> 56:27.727
- In the game of Go,

56:27.794 --> 56:29.994
we call it the divine move.

56:39.194 --> 56:40.294
- None of my texts
are going through.

56:40.360 --> 56:42.793
I can't reach...

56:42.859 --> 56:44.992
anyone.

56:45.058 --> 56:47.459
- Do you think that's connected?

56:55.892 --> 56:57.392
Oh!

57:01.225 --> 57:03.292
- Someone was killed here.

57:03.357 --> 57:04.924
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure
a lot of people

57:04.991 --> 57:06.090
have been killed here, Lydia.

57:06.191 --> 57:07.657
- Recently.

57:09.756 --> 57:12.023
- Are we gonna be killed here?

57:23.423 --> 57:27.489
Please tell me that
Allison didn't do that.

57:27.555 --> 57:29.789
- Dad, put me down!

57:29.855 --> 57:30.888
Please put me down.

57:30.954 --> 57:32.355
- You said you couldn't walk.

57:32.422 --> 57:33.588
- I can hop.

57:41.754 --> 57:42.953
Ow.

57:43.020 --> 57:44.188
- You almost had that shot.

57:44.221 --> 57:45.653
- No, I didn't.

57:45.720 --> 57:48.221
- Yes, you did. I saw it.
You were right at the goal.

57:48.287 --> 57:50.053
You're better than
you think you are.

57:50.187 --> 57:51.587
- I was in
for less than a minute.

57:51.653 --> 57:53.819
I got the ball for a second
and I got knocked on my ass

57:53.886 --> 57:55.919
and I twisted my ankle.

57:55.986 --> 57:57.886
It wasn't anything.
- Eli.

57:57.952 --> 57:58.986
- It was nothing.

57:59.052 --> 58:00.386
- It was something.

58:02.686 --> 58:06.186
I was watching Coach
and he saw it too.

58:06.252 --> 58:07.618
You're good.

58:07.685 --> 58:10.018
You're really good.

58:10.085 --> 58:12.718
And...if you can heal,

58:12.785 --> 58:14.385
you can play tomorrow night,

58:14.451 --> 58:17.351
and you can help them win.

58:17.418 --> 58:20.650
The first step to transforming
is healing,

58:20.717 --> 58:22.717
but you've got to be
willing to learn.

58:24.717 --> 58:26.350
- Ah.

58:31.516 --> 58:32.749
- Get down!

58:32.816 --> 58:34.716
Run! Run!

58:52.481 --> 58:54.081
Allison?

59:52.942 --> 59:54.742
- Ah!

1:00:09.175 --> 1:00:10.974
- Liam?

1:00:11.040 --> 1:00:12.707
Oh, shit.

1:00:15.039 --> 1:00:17.440
- Scott, get to Eli.

1:00:17.507 --> 1:00:18.873
- Derek, he's not here.

1:00:18.939 --> 1:00:20.806
- He was.

1:00:20.873 --> 1:00:22.140
He knows what to do.

1:00:22.207 --> 1:00:24.973
We--we have a plan.

1:00:25.039 --> 1:00:26.873
He has the--

1:00:26.939 --> 1:00:28.439
he has the car.

1:00:28.506 --> 1:00:30.072
- Don't--don't try to talk.

1:00:30.139 --> 1:00:34.273
- Eli, he'll go to the shop.

1:00:34.338 --> 1:00:36.738
He knows what to do.
He knows what to do.

1:00:36.805 --> 1:00:39.971
- Don't talk.

1:00:40.037 --> 1:00:42.037
Hey, hey!

1:00:42.104 --> 1:00:43.238
- Scott.
- What?

1:00:43.305 --> 1:00:45.371
- It's not just Allison.

1:00:45.437 --> 1:00:48.437
- It's the Oni. It's Nogitsune.
- They're coming.

1:00:55.003 --> 1:00:57.770
- Scott, what do we do?

1:01:04.536 --> 1:01:07.735
- Liam, get to Stilinski,
find Lydia,

1:01:07.802 --> 1:01:09.402
and tell them
we need their help.

1:01:09.469 --> 1:01:12.001
Tell them we need everyone.

1:01:12.068 --> 1:01:13.335
Malia, let's get him
out of here.

1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:25.168
- It looks like the radius

1:01:25.201 --> 1:01:27.168
is about the same
as the previous fires.

1:01:27.234 --> 1:01:28.301
- Take the others
and see if you can find

1:01:28.368 --> 1:01:31.200
any kind of incendiary device.

1:01:31.267 --> 1:01:35.200
- Parrish.

1:01:35.267 --> 1:01:37.799
What's your take on this?

1:01:37.866 --> 1:01:39.832
- Are you asking me
as a deputy or?

1:01:39.899 --> 1:01:42.332
- As someone who's known to
set himself on fire

1:01:42.399 --> 1:01:44.366
because he's a demon called
a hellhound?

1:01:44.432 --> 1:01:46.166
- Yeah, but I'm a nice demon.

1:01:46.199 --> 1:01:48.665
- Given.

1:01:48.731 --> 1:01:50.965
Who set these fires?

1:01:51.031 --> 1:01:53.031
- Not an arsonist.
- Yeah.

1:01:53.166 --> 1:01:56.331
A serial arsonist would want
to watch the fire burn,

1:01:56.398 --> 1:01:59.165
not have it snuffed out
minutes after ignition.

1:01:59.198 --> 1:02:02.331
And plus they typically have
an emotional cooling off period,

1:02:02.397 --> 1:02:03.364
and--
- These are being set

1:02:03.430 --> 1:02:04.764
one after another.

1:02:04.830 --> 1:02:06.530
And all that says one thing,
that these fires--

1:02:06.597 --> 1:02:09.464
- Are not about fire.

1:02:10.696 --> 1:02:12.297
- Go see what you can dig up.

1:02:12.364 --> 1:02:14.696
I'm gonna call our consultant.

1:02:25.495 --> 1:02:27.562
I know that sound.

1:02:36.262 --> 1:02:37.827
Parrish!

1:02:40.060 --> 1:02:41.227
Hewitt!

1:02:56.393 --> 1:02:59.325
Oh, God damn it.

1:02:59.392 --> 1:03:01.925
I knew I should've retired.

1:03:09.791 --> 1:03:11.724
Jeez!

1:03:21.023 --> 1:03:22.323
- Eli! Eli.

1:03:22.390 --> 1:03:24.157
- We're gonna find him.

1:03:24.223 --> 1:03:25.290
But we have to help you first.

1:03:25.357 --> 1:03:27.257
- No. No, Eli.

1:03:27.323 --> 1:03:30.489
His ankle, he twisted it.
He can't run.

1:03:30.556 --> 1:03:31.789
- But he can heal.

1:03:31.856 --> 1:03:33.556
- No, he won't.
- Eli can't heal,

1:03:33.622 --> 1:03:35.789
not like a werewolf, not yet.

1:03:35.856 --> 1:03:37.289
- What's wrong with him?

1:03:37.356 --> 1:03:39.422
- You know how some people
pass out when they see a needle?

1:03:39.489 --> 1:03:40.855
Eli passes out when
he sees his own fangs.

1:03:40.921 --> 1:03:42.156
- He passes out?

1:03:42.222 --> 1:03:43.755
- The fangs come out.
- He's on the floor.

1:03:43.821 --> 1:03:46.020
Claws too.

1:03:46.155 --> 1:03:49.188
- Scott, you have to find him.

1:03:49.255 --> 1:03:51.987
You have to find him before
she does.

1:04:20.385 --> 1:04:21.618
- Sheriff!

1:04:25.784 --> 1:04:27.451
Sheriff!

1:04:29.284 --> 1:04:32.184
Where are you?

1:04:32.251 --> 1:04:33.916
- Mason?

1:04:33.983 --> 1:04:36.050
Mason, help.

1:04:37.883 --> 1:04:38.750
Help.

1:04:38.816 --> 1:04:40.683
Ah!

1:04:57.315 --> 1:04:58.681
- Sheriff.

1:05:00.249 --> 1:05:01.548
- No!

1:05:08.381 --> 1:05:09.613
Aw, shit.

1:05:34.811 --> 1:05:35.978
- Go!

1:05:39.445 --> 1:05:41.378
- All right. Come on.

1:05:44.344 --> 1:05:45.377
- Easy.

1:05:45.444 --> 1:05:47.010
- Here.

1:05:47.144 --> 1:05:49.210
- Easy. Easy.

1:05:49.277 --> 1:05:50.410
- You have to find Eli.

1:05:50.477 --> 1:05:51.577
Eli.

1:05:51.644 --> 1:05:53.144
You have to find Eli.

1:05:55.643 --> 1:05:59.209
Derek, you're gonna need to
let Scott and the others

1:05:59.276 --> 1:06:00.309
take care of it, OK?

1:06:00.376 --> 1:06:01.942
Anyone that loses
this much blood,

1:06:02.008 --> 1:06:03.276
human or werewolf,

1:06:03.343 --> 1:06:05.409
you're not gonna be any good
to anyone else.

1:06:05.475 --> 1:06:06.742
- We need a lighter.

1:06:06.808 --> 1:06:08.708
The healing process
works faster with fire.

1:06:11.907 --> 1:06:15.841
- I've been known to light
a spark or two in my time.

1:06:29.141 --> 1:06:31.440
- Peter, no.

1:06:51.239 --> 1:06:52.871
- Do I need to remind you people

1:06:52.938 --> 1:06:56.037
that he slashed my throat once
and it killed me?

1:06:56.138 --> 1:06:58.471
- When it comes to you,
most of us try to forget.

1:06:58.538 --> 1:07:01.537
- That is no way to speak
to your father.

1:07:01.603 --> 1:07:03.204
- Look,
we're running out of time.

1:07:03.270 --> 1:07:04.603
We've got to catch up to Eli.

1:07:04.670 --> 1:07:06.737
- You mean before Allison does.

1:07:08.503 --> 1:07:09.969
Allison Argent,
back from the dead,

1:07:10.036 --> 1:07:11.470
running around,
shooting up werewolves

1:07:11.536 --> 1:07:12.802
like a good little hunter?

1:07:12.869 --> 1:07:14.869
You must be so proud.

1:07:16.436 --> 1:07:19.236
- Can we just lower the level
of the testosterone

1:07:19.302 --> 1:07:21.801
in the room, fellas? Huh?

1:07:21.868 --> 1:07:22.935
- Derek said that
they had a plan

1:07:23.001 --> 1:07:24.136
for when something like this
happens.

1:07:24.202 --> 1:07:25.768
- The auto shop.

1:07:25.835 --> 1:07:27.768
That's where they'll go.

1:07:27.835 --> 1:07:28.901
Emergency rendezvous point.

1:07:28.967 --> 1:07:30.135
How far behind was Allison?

1:07:30.168 --> 1:07:31.800
- Not far enough.
- I'm coming with you.

1:07:31.867 --> 1:07:34.934
- No. You need to find Lydia.

1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:36.734
Liam and Hikari are already
looking for Stilinski,

1:07:36.800 --> 1:07:38.334
but honestly, if there's anyone
who could figure

1:07:38.400 --> 1:07:39.999
this thing out, it's Lydia.

1:07:40.134 --> 1:07:41.899
Find Lydia.
I'll get Eli.

1:07:41.966 --> 1:07:43.134
- Wait.
- I gotta go.

1:07:43.167 --> 1:07:44.499
- Wait!

1:07:44.566 --> 1:07:46.633
Scott, wait, wait.
- What, Mom? What?

1:07:48.933 --> 1:07:50.599
- If there's some small chance
that it's her,

1:07:50.666 --> 1:07:53.366
that it's really Allison--

1:07:53.433 --> 1:07:55.565
- It can't be, right?

1:07:55.632 --> 1:07:57.166
It's impossible.

1:07:57.233 --> 1:07:58.565
- Listen to me.

1:07:58.632 --> 1:08:00.898
If I've learned anything
living in Beacon Hills,

1:08:00.965 --> 1:08:02.897
it's that every time someone
says something's impossible,

1:08:02.964 --> 1:08:05.697
somehow the impossible
seems to happen.

1:08:05.764 --> 1:08:06.831
If you think it's really her,

1:08:06.897 --> 1:08:09.198
you have to find her
and stop her

1:08:09.265 --> 1:08:12.664
and help her remember
who she was.

1:08:12.731 --> 1:08:14.963
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you too.

1:08:17.596 --> 1:08:19.930
Go get her.

1:08:48.128 --> 1:08:49.561
- Come on.

1:09:58.721 --> 1:10:00.287
- What do you smell?

1:10:05.087 --> 1:10:06.720
- Fear.

1:10:06.786 --> 1:10:08.620
- That would be me.

1:10:11.686 --> 1:10:13.220
- You're gonna want to see this.

1:10:17.852 --> 1:10:20.052
- He was a kitsune,

1:10:20.120 --> 1:10:22.552
probably didn't even know it.

1:10:22.619 --> 1:10:23.885
If the Nogitsune murdered him,

1:10:23.952 --> 1:10:26.051
then he did it
to steal his tails.

1:10:26.119 --> 1:10:28.352
- The tails only get him
one thing:

1:10:28.419 --> 1:10:29.884
the Oni.

1:10:29.951 --> 1:10:31.051
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:10:31.119 --> 1:10:32.818
I have a tail.

1:10:32.884 --> 1:10:34.818
No one's planning on
stealing my tail, right?

1:10:34.884 --> 1:10:37.351
- Will you please shut up?

1:10:37.418 --> 1:10:40.618
There's more going on and
I think it's all connected.

1:10:40.683 --> 1:10:44.151
- More what?

1:10:44.218 --> 1:10:46.783
- Well, someone's
been setting fires.

1:10:46.850 --> 1:10:48.350
- If Allison catches up to Eli,

1:10:48.417 --> 1:10:49.717
we might need
some real medical attention,

1:10:49.783 --> 1:10:51.450
not just a blow torch.

1:10:51.517 --> 1:10:54.217
- I feel like that
was aimed at me.

1:10:54.283 --> 1:10:56.416
- Get out of the way or
there'll be a gun aimed at you.

1:10:56.482 --> 1:10:57.616
- Of course.

1:10:57.682 --> 1:11:01.182
Just satisfy my curiosity
about one thing.

1:11:01.249 --> 1:11:03.648
Who are you going out there
to help,

1:11:03.715 --> 1:11:06.815
her or him,
predator or prey?

1:11:06.881 --> 1:11:10.215
- I'll stop anyone who tries to
kill an innocent 15-year-old.

1:11:10.281 --> 1:11:11.947
- And yet you look like
a man with doubts.

1:11:12.014 --> 1:11:13.248
Let's ask the expert.

1:11:13.315 --> 1:11:15.248
Mr. Deaton?

1:11:18.747 --> 1:11:20.247
- The Nogitsune is
an extraordinarily

1:11:20.314 --> 1:11:21.547
powerful creature.

1:11:21.614 --> 1:11:23.180
It can create illusions

1:11:23.247 --> 1:11:25.547
that are nearly
indistinguishable from reality.

1:11:25.613 --> 1:11:27.114
- Illusion.

1:11:27.147 --> 1:11:29.913
- But that illusion today,

1:11:29.979 --> 1:11:32.945
that looked pretty damn real
to me.

1:11:34.413 --> 1:11:35.513
- Me too.

1:11:35.579 --> 1:11:36.945
- I know what I saw.

1:11:43.345 --> 1:11:46.345
I saw an exact replica,

1:11:46.412 --> 1:11:50.344
meant to trick us
into lowering our guard.

1:11:50.411 --> 1:11:52.477
My daughter is gone.

1:11:52.544 --> 1:11:58.177
Whoever or whatever is out there
isn't Allison.

1:11:58.244 --> 1:11:59.876
It's an illusion.

1:11:59.943 --> 1:12:03.010
- Then I say,
let's dispel the illusion.

1:13:55.533 --> 1:13:56.833
- Allison, stop!

1:14:01.965 --> 1:14:05.532
Come on! Come on!
Go, go, go, go!

1:14:05.599 --> 1:14:07.799
Ah!
- Oh, shit.

1:14:07.865 --> 1:14:09.365
OK. Go.

1:14:12.365 --> 1:14:13.964
Oh! Ah, come on!

1:14:14.099 --> 1:14:15.298
Come on! Let's go!
- OK. OK.

1:14:15.364 --> 1:14:17.099
- I know you don't
remember everything,

1:14:17.164 --> 1:14:18.598
but if you stop trying to
kill us for half a second,

1:14:18.664 --> 1:14:20.098
I could help you remember!

1:14:24.797 --> 1:14:26.830
Come on! All right! Hey!

1:14:26.897 --> 1:14:28.098
We're gonna have to run.

1:14:28.098 --> 1:14:29.663
I need you to heal.
- I can't.

1:14:29.730 --> 1:14:31.097
I can't heal. I can't transform.

1:14:31.130 --> 1:14:32.263
I can't do any of it.

1:14:32.330 --> 1:14:34.130
- Well, you're gonna learn
right now.

1:14:35.263 --> 1:14:36.429
- How?

1:14:36.496 --> 1:14:38.329
- Like this.

1:14:58.560 --> 1:15:01.394
- We've got multiple calls
about a fire.

1:15:01.460 --> 1:15:03.094
- Copy, Dispatch.
We're en route now.

1:15:03.094 --> 1:15:06.594
Parrish, go to two.

1:15:06.659 --> 1:15:08.593
- I'll hit the station.

1:15:08.659 --> 1:15:10.094
But, Sheriff,

1:15:10.127 --> 1:15:12.993
Mason, he just--he vanished.

1:15:13.093 --> 1:15:15.393
- We don't know
what happened to him yet.

1:15:15.459 --> 1:15:17.992
Right now,
I need you at the station.

1:15:18.093 --> 1:15:19.126
I'll check Hale Auto.

1:15:19.193 --> 1:15:21.425
You copy me?

1:15:21.492 --> 1:15:23.093
- Copy, sir.

1:15:27.158 --> 1:15:30.192
- Come on, Eli! Don't stop!
She's right behind us.

1:15:31.924 --> 1:15:33.924
Come on, keep going.

1:15:33.991 --> 1:15:35.091
Kid, come on, get up, get up!

1:15:35.124 --> 1:15:38.457
Go, go, go! Right there, go!

1:15:42.490 --> 1:15:45.124
Listen, you're gonna have to
keep going on without me.

1:15:45.190 --> 1:15:46.356
- Wait, what are you
talking about?

1:15:46.423 --> 1:15:47.690
- I have to try to
get through to her.

1:15:47.756 --> 1:15:50.590
- She's trying to get
an arrow through you.

1:15:55.655 --> 1:15:57.455
- What is that?

1:15:57.522 --> 1:15:59.189
- Wolfsbane.

1:15:59.255 --> 1:16:00.988
She coated the arrowheads
in wolfsbane.

1:16:01.089 --> 1:16:02.888
- My dad told me you almost
had to cut his arm off once

1:16:02.954 --> 1:16:04.988
because of wolfsbane poisoning.

1:16:05.089 --> 1:16:06.454
- You need to run, Eli.

1:16:06.521 --> 1:16:08.554
We're not far from the road.
I--I'll keep her busy.

1:16:08.621 --> 1:16:11.920
- I can't. OK?
I can't do it without you.

1:16:11.987 --> 1:16:14.288
- Hey, you're gonna be
all right, OK?

1:16:14.354 --> 1:16:15.620
Remember, you just learned
how to heal.

1:16:15.687 --> 1:16:16.753
- You did that for me.

1:16:16.820 --> 1:16:18.587
- I gave you a push.

1:16:18.653 --> 1:16:21.420
And if Allison has any chance
of remembering who she is,

1:16:21.487 --> 1:16:23.952
she's gonna need the same push.

1:16:24.087 --> 1:16:25.253
Find your dad.

1:16:25.320 --> 1:16:26.552
I think I'm gonna need his help.

1:16:26.619 --> 1:16:29.087
- Yeah, OK.

1:16:33.386 --> 1:16:35.086
- Yeah, the fires all happened

1:16:35.152 --> 1:16:37.951
right after the jar
was taken from Japan.

1:16:38.086 --> 1:16:40.152
- Liam, that's him.

1:16:40.218 --> 1:16:41.185
- That's the guy
who stole the jar,

1:16:41.251 --> 1:16:43.151
the one who freed the Nogitsune.

1:16:43.218 --> 1:16:44.817
- He's the one
setting the fires.

1:16:44.884 --> 1:16:46.850
- And not the Nogitsune?

1:16:46.917 --> 1:16:49.251
Why don't we catch him
and kill the Nogitsune?

1:16:49.318 --> 1:16:50.584
That sounds like
a pretty good plan to me.

1:16:50.650 --> 1:16:52.484
- Well, the Nogitsune's
not a person.

1:16:52.550 --> 1:16:56.450
It's an ancient power, so old
it's practically elemental.

1:16:56.517 --> 1:16:58.284
It might not be possible
to kill him.

1:16:58.350 --> 1:17:00.749
- Well, I'm willing
to give it a shot.

1:17:00.816 --> 1:17:03.483
- We're wasting time.

1:17:03.549 --> 1:17:05.083
You guys can figure out
who's starting the fire.

1:17:05.149 --> 1:17:06.815
We need to find Scott.

1:17:25.714 --> 1:17:29.081
- She drove this one,
smashed right into Derek's.

1:17:30.846 --> 1:17:32.181
- You smell something else?

1:17:34.913 --> 1:17:37.080
Anger.

1:17:37.113 --> 1:17:39.413
The air, it's rife
with a homicidal rage.

1:17:39.480 --> 1:17:41.380
She certainly has the anger
of an Argent.

1:17:41.446 --> 1:17:44.180
- Then it's more proof
it's not Allison.

1:17:44.246 --> 1:17:46.213
My daughter wouldn't kill
a 15-year-old boy.

1:17:46.279 --> 1:17:47.812
- You had the Nogitsune
in your head.

1:17:47.879 --> 1:17:48.979
Maybe it's in hers.

1:17:49.079 --> 1:17:50.212
- If there's room enough,

1:17:50.279 --> 1:17:52.079
with all of that
unadulterated fury.

1:17:52.079 --> 1:17:54.644
- Not everybody has your anger.

1:17:54.711 --> 1:17:56.478
- Not everyone
has your optimism.

1:17:56.544 --> 1:17:58.544
Don't underestimate anger,
Melissa.

1:17:58.611 --> 1:18:00.344
We all have the same instinct
for fight or flight.

1:18:00.411 --> 1:18:04.777
Flight begins with fear
but fight is born of anger.

1:18:04.843 --> 1:18:06.344
- She put an arrow
into his truck.

1:18:06.411 --> 1:18:09.443
They're on the run, that way.

1:18:09.510 --> 1:18:10.943
- Can you track 'em
through the woods?

1:18:11.077 --> 1:18:12.510
both: Yes.

1:18:20.776 --> 1:18:22.509
- Allison, stop!

1:18:38.075 --> 1:18:40.175
I want to talk.

1:18:41.108 --> 1:18:42.740
- Sure, let's talk.

1:18:46.174 --> 1:18:47.706
- Dad? Dad?

1:18:47.773 --> 1:18:48.973
- Eli?

1:18:49.074 --> 1:18:50.473
Eli!

1:18:53.673 --> 1:18:54.873
You're safe, Eli.

1:18:54.939 --> 1:18:56.373
You're safe.

1:18:56.439 --> 1:18:57.972
- Yeah, but Scott isn't.

1:18:58.073 --> 1:19:00.139
- Hey, we got a problem.

1:19:01.938 --> 1:19:03.206
- Three of them.

1:19:18.571 --> 1:19:20.571
- It was done by a sword.

1:20:14.032 --> 1:20:15.366
- Hikari!

1:20:57.628 --> 1:20:58.828
- Dad!

1:21:16.493 --> 1:21:18.660
- Oh, no!

1:21:21.193 --> 1:21:22.560
- Deaton!

1:21:37.092 --> 1:21:38.125
- Dad--

1:21:47.623 --> 1:21:49.790
Remember who you are.

1:21:58.157 --> 1:22:01.322
- Malia?
- Come on. Come on!

1:22:13.788 --> 1:22:15.521
- Allison, if you just
give me one second,

1:22:15.588 --> 1:22:17.755
I can tell you the truth.
- You killed half my family.

1:22:17.820 --> 1:22:20.620
- I never killed anyone,
and neither did you.

1:22:25.654 --> 1:22:28.919
I know those daggers
have wolfsbane on them.

1:22:29.054 --> 1:22:31.054
And I know you think you're
gonna go through with it.

1:22:34.519 --> 1:22:36.319
- Because that's what
the Nogitsune wants.

1:22:36.386 --> 1:22:40.053
He wants me to die
in your arms this time.

1:22:40.053 --> 1:22:42.053
Are you ready for that?

1:22:42.119 --> 1:22:44.086
Because it's not easy.

1:22:44.618 --> 1:22:47.318
- Come on.

1:22:54.717 --> 1:22:57.085
- Eli, what are you doing?

1:22:57.152 --> 1:22:59.051
- I can do this.
- Oh, shit!

1:23:01.384 --> 1:23:03.051
- No!

1:23:19.183 --> 1:23:20.882
Eli.

1:23:25.449 --> 1:23:26.914
- Whoa, OK, stop!

1:23:27.049 --> 1:23:29.514
What's it gonna take to
get you to stop and listen?

1:23:55.079 --> 1:23:57.246
OK, you killed me.

1:23:57.312 --> 1:23:58.945
Now can we talk?

1:23:59.046 --> 1:24:01.911
- Why is the guy who went to
Japan to free the Nogitsune

1:24:02.046 --> 1:24:03.845
now in Beacon Hills trying
to burn down the woods?

1:24:03.911 --> 1:24:05.245
- He's not trying to
burn down the woods.

1:24:05.311 --> 1:24:08.844
It's...only part of it.

1:24:08.910 --> 1:24:10.710
- Do we have to play
junior detectives?

1:24:10.777 --> 1:24:13.078
Can't we just leave it up
to the actual detectives?

1:24:13.145 --> 1:24:15.477
- Do you see any actual
detectives standing around?

1:24:18.876 --> 1:24:21.609
- But what do detectives do,
anyway?

1:24:21.676 --> 1:24:24.244
Do they, like, go to
the scene of the crime and...

1:24:24.310 --> 1:24:26.576
detect something?

1:24:28.609 --> 1:24:30.908
- That's exactly what they do.

1:24:31.043 --> 1:24:33.309
- We need to look at
one of the burn sites,

1:24:33.376 --> 1:24:35.309
the first one.

1:24:35.375 --> 1:24:36.908
- Guys, guys.

1:24:37.043 --> 1:24:38.375
Hi.

1:24:38.442 --> 1:24:40.108
We got a big-ass problem.

1:24:40.175 --> 1:24:43.575
Derek, Stilinski, Eli, Deaton,
they're all gone.

1:24:43.641 --> 1:24:44.641
- What do you mean gone?

1:24:44.707 --> 1:24:46.175
- They were taken.

1:24:46.242 --> 1:24:47.841
- By who?

1:24:48.907 --> 1:24:50.541
- The Oni.

1:25:00.473 --> 1:25:03.373
There's blood...

1:25:03.440 --> 1:25:05.939
all around here,
and a lot.

1:25:06.040 --> 1:25:08.040
- If she managed to cut him
with her ring dagger

1:25:08.106 --> 1:25:09.705
then he's in trouble.

1:25:09.772 --> 1:25:11.272
They're laced with wolfsbane.

1:25:11.339 --> 1:25:12.705
- How long does he have?

1:25:12.772 --> 1:25:15.205
- Six, eight hours at most.

1:25:23.838 --> 1:25:25.704
- These rapid burns...

1:25:29.837 --> 1:25:32.737
There is something
systematic about it.

1:25:32.803 --> 1:25:34.403
- Is she gonna keep
talking like this?

1:25:34.470 --> 1:25:37.137
- I stopped listening
six hours ago.

1:25:37.203 --> 1:25:38.669
- All right. I'm sorry.

1:25:38.736 --> 1:25:39.702
I'm not gonna spend
the rest of the day

1:25:39.769 --> 1:25:40.702
walking through the woods,

1:25:40.769 --> 1:25:42.436
trying to catch a pyromaniac.

1:25:42.502 --> 1:25:43.902
- Do you have a better plan?

1:25:44.037 --> 1:25:45.936
- We already know
what kills the Oni.

1:25:46.036 --> 1:25:47.569
- Silver.

1:25:47.636 --> 1:25:48.935
- You with me?

1:25:49.036 --> 1:25:50.668
- Go.
Get all the silver you can.

1:25:50.735 --> 1:25:52.835
And if you find the Oni,
don't fight them, kill them.

1:26:10.833 --> 1:26:13.134
- We're heading back to
the main road, aren't we?

1:26:15.833 --> 1:26:19.666
And my blood,
it's going to lure them.

1:26:19.733 --> 1:26:21.865
I'm the bait for
the trap, right?

1:26:24.133 --> 1:26:27.798
'Cause by the time the others
catch up to us, I'll be dead,

1:26:27.865 --> 1:26:29.232
and you can pick the others
off one by one.

1:26:29.298 --> 1:26:31.532
Is that the plan?

1:26:31.598 --> 1:26:33.298
- Yeah, actually.
That is the plan.

1:26:35.797 --> 1:26:37.864
- You don't hunt werewolves,
Allison.

1:26:37.931 --> 1:26:40.331
And no matter what the Nogitsune
put into your head,

1:26:40.397 --> 1:26:42.431
you don't kill them either.

1:26:42.497 --> 1:26:43.863
And I think part of you
knows it.

1:26:43.930 --> 1:26:46.064
I saw it the moment
you stabbed me.

1:26:46.131 --> 1:26:48.863
- Saw what?

1:26:48.930 --> 1:26:50.031
- Regret.

1:26:53.096 --> 1:26:55.596
- Go.

1:26:58.895 --> 1:27:02.595
- Jackson, what do you smell?

1:27:02.662 --> 1:27:04.562
- Ugh. The horrifying
stench of death.

1:27:04.629 --> 1:27:06.728
- What else do you smell?

1:27:11.162 --> 1:27:13.161
- It's not gas.

1:27:13.228 --> 1:27:16.128
It's not lighter fluid
or anything like that.

1:27:16.194 --> 1:27:17.727
It's different.

1:27:17.793 --> 1:27:20.361
- Chemical accelerant.

1:27:20.428 --> 1:27:22.028
Mm-hmm. It's a quick burn

1:27:22.094 --> 1:27:24.660
so they can't set
the rest of the forest on fire.

1:27:24.727 --> 1:27:27.060
- Well, does that tell us
anything useful?

1:27:27.127 --> 1:27:31.193
- Well, in terms of the fire,
they know chemicals.

1:27:34.559 --> 1:27:36.592
They know exactly
how to use them.

1:27:36.659 --> 1:27:38.292
- I don't get it.
Why would someone

1:27:38.359 --> 1:27:41.725
spend all this time and energy
burning up rowan trees?

1:27:41.791 --> 1:27:43.259
- Rowan trees?
- Yeah.

1:27:43.326 --> 1:27:45.026
That's what the smell is, right?

1:27:45.026 --> 1:27:46.325
- Jackson, do you know
what rowan trees become

1:27:46.391 --> 1:27:47.591
after they're burned?

1:27:47.658 --> 1:27:49.791
- Ash?

1:27:53.425 --> 1:27:55.325
- Mountain ash.

1:28:02.024 --> 1:28:04.889
- You're not gonna kill me.

1:28:05.024 --> 1:28:09.223
- That's right. The wolfsbane is
going to kill you.

1:28:09.289 --> 1:28:10.689
- You had a code.

1:28:10.756 --> 1:28:12.056
- Mm-hmm.

1:28:12.123 --> 1:28:13.423
"We hunt those who hunt us."

1:28:13.489 --> 1:28:16.722
- No.

1:28:16.788 --> 1:28:19.655
You came up with a new one.

1:28:19.722 --> 1:28:23.854
"We protect--"
- "We protect those who...

1:28:23.921 --> 1:28:26.587
cannot protect themselves."

1:28:26.654 --> 1:28:28.754
- You remember.

1:28:44.020 --> 1:28:46.253
- We should grab
whatever we can.

1:28:51.619 --> 1:28:53.685
- I'm taking this.

1:28:57.185 --> 1:28:58.485
- Don't worry.
It's not the look.

1:28:58.552 --> 1:29:00.319
It's more of a...

1:29:00.385 --> 1:29:03.218
"you look really hot holding
a tactical tomahawk" look.

1:29:10.683 --> 1:29:14.184
- If we don't die tonight,
we can talk about it.

1:29:14.250 --> 1:29:15.417
- Huh.

1:29:15.483 --> 1:29:18.117
Then I'm definitely not
dying tonight.

1:29:43.415 --> 1:29:46.547
- Scott.

1:29:46.614 --> 1:29:48.148
- Yes, he's handsome.

1:29:48.214 --> 1:29:50.847
History is replete
with handsome killers.

1:29:50.913 --> 1:29:52.514
He's still a killer.

1:29:52.580 --> 1:29:53.813
- What am I even doing here?

1:29:53.879 --> 1:29:56.479
This--this can't be
the right thing to do.

1:29:56.546 --> 1:29:59.379
- Don't get lost in useless
moral quandaries, Allison.

1:29:59.446 --> 1:30:01.013
Stick to the plan.

1:30:01.079 --> 1:30:03.079
Your father is on his way here
right now.

1:30:03.146 --> 1:30:05.379
- I saw him at the hospital.
That was him.

1:30:05.446 --> 1:30:09.979
- No, he's on his way and
he's bringing Peter Hale.

1:30:10.046 --> 1:30:12.012
You remember what
that monster did to Kate?

1:30:12.078 --> 1:30:14.911
He ripped her throat out
with his claws.

1:30:14.978 --> 1:30:17.278
He'll do the same to you
if he gets the chance.

1:30:17.345 --> 1:30:19.777
Don't you remember
how they burned us?

1:30:19.844 --> 1:30:22.244
We lost years.

1:30:22.311 --> 1:30:27.943
Can't you feel that life
stolen from you?

1:30:28.011 --> 1:30:29.411
- I don't know what I feel!

1:30:29.476 --> 1:30:31.310
- A few more hours
and the sun goes down.

1:30:31.376 --> 1:30:33.510
We'll take care
of everything then.

1:30:33.576 --> 1:30:35.909
They come out at night.

1:30:35.976 --> 1:30:39.043
- Who?
- The Oni.

1:30:39.110 --> 1:30:43.775
And with them comes chaos.

1:30:52.175 --> 1:30:54.341
- Eli.

1:30:54.408 --> 1:30:56.374
Eli, can you hear me?

1:31:14.373 --> 1:31:15.872
We're not dead.

1:31:16.007 --> 1:31:18.406
- Not yet.

1:31:20.472 --> 1:31:21.472
- Where are we?

1:31:21.539 --> 1:31:23.805
- It's just an illusion.

1:31:38.005 --> 1:31:40.170
- What about them?

1:32:03.335 --> 1:32:06.035
If we don't come up with a way
to get this wolfsbane out soon,

1:32:06.102 --> 1:32:09.701
I'm going to die.

1:32:09.767 --> 1:32:11.634
We need to find Liam.

1:32:11.701 --> 1:32:13.002
- Your beta?

1:32:13.068 --> 1:32:15.634
- My friend.

1:32:15.701 --> 1:32:17.401
Liam and Hikari.

1:32:17.467 --> 1:32:19.167
- She's a kitsune.

1:32:19.234 --> 1:32:22.034
That's why that arrow
didn't do anything to her.

1:32:22.101 --> 1:32:23.900
- Because of the fox.

1:32:24.001 --> 1:32:26.100
It protects her, like armor.

1:32:26.166 --> 1:32:28.600
- It won't protect her
from the Oni.

1:32:28.666 --> 1:32:30.333
- Nothing protected you either.

1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:35.265
- What do you mean?
- You died in my arms.

1:32:38.065 --> 1:32:41.165
And if you let me,
I could prove it to you.

1:32:43.431 --> 1:32:45.498
You're lying.

1:32:45.564 --> 1:32:47.998
- Just give me a chance.

1:32:50.298 --> 1:32:55.763
If you still
don't believe me, fine.

1:32:55.830 --> 1:32:57.998
Let me die.

1:32:59.130 --> 1:33:01.030
- And what if I do?

1:33:01.097 --> 1:33:03.397
- Well, then you're gonna
have to save me.

1:33:07.662 --> 1:33:10.296
- Derek, I'm not so sure
even your strength

1:33:10.362 --> 1:33:13.096
could break those bonds,
not here.

1:33:13.162 --> 1:33:14.396
- Eli, are you OK?

1:33:14.462 --> 1:33:15.996
How's your leg?

1:33:16.029 --> 1:33:17.528
- Yeah, it's fine.

1:33:17.595 --> 1:33:18.996
It's healed.

1:33:18.996 --> 1:33:20.061
- You learn how to heal?

1:33:20.128 --> 1:33:21.128
- Yeah, kind of.

1:33:21.195 --> 1:33:22.661
Well, Scott did most of it.

1:33:22.728 --> 1:33:24.794
- That's amazing!

1:33:24.860 --> 1:33:26.295
- Hey, Derek.

1:33:26.361 --> 1:33:27.427
Maybe you want to be
a little more subtle

1:33:27.494 --> 1:33:30.194
with your antics.

1:33:30.260 --> 1:33:33.594
- The Nogitsune isn't gonna
kill us, not yet.

1:33:33.660 --> 1:33:36.559
He put us here to watch him win.

1:33:36.626 --> 1:33:38.493
We're here for our pain.

1:33:43.193 --> 1:33:44.858
- Do you guys hear that?

1:33:49.658 --> 1:33:51.725
- It sounds like--

1:33:51.792 --> 1:33:53.425
- Lacrosse.

1:34:10.324 --> 1:34:11.991
- At least we know
she hasn't caught him yet.

1:34:11.991 --> 1:34:14.157
- No, she's caught him.

1:34:14.223 --> 1:34:16.556
Allison knows to retrieve
her arrows whenever she can.

1:34:16.623 --> 1:34:18.990
This was left so we're
following the right trail.

1:34:19.056 --> 1:34:20.589
- Guys.

1:34:23.090 --> 1:34:25.255
I don't think
we're following a trail.

1:34:25.322 --> 1:34:27.689
We're being led into a trap,
and I think that's it.

1:34:27.755 --> 1:34:28.989
It's the college stadium.

1:34:29.055 --> 1:34:31.122
That's where the lacrosse
tournament's being held.

1:34:31.189 --> 1:34:32.588
- And while they play
a lacrosse game,

1:34:32.654 --> 1:34:36.521
we'll be playing right
into the Nogitsune's game.

1:34:36.588 --> 1:34:38.821
That's where he'll make
his final moves.

1:34:38.888 --> 1:34:40.988
Let's just hope he hasn't
figured out a divine move.

1:34:40.988 --> 1:34:42.154
- What's that?

1:34:42.221 --> 1:34:43.620
- It's a move in the game of Go.

1:34:43.687 --> 1:34:48.088
- It's a move so brilliant,
so inspired,

1:34:48.153 --> 1:34:49.620
that it changes the shape
of the entire game.

1:34:49.687 --> 1:34:53.619
A move that only a god
could make.

1:34:53.686 --> 1:34:55.187
Divine.

1:35:00.552 --> 1:35:02.785
- I think the accelerant
used to start these fires

1:35:02.851 --> 1:35:06.052
might be the same one used to
start a fire over 20 years ago.

1:35:06.119 --> 1:35:08.751
- Are you talking about the fire
that killed Derek's family?

1:35:08.818 --> 1:35:11.518
- And there's one more thing.

1:35:11.585 --> 1:35:14.717
The person who came up with this
formula is supposed to be dead.

1:35:14.784 --> 1:35:16.285
- "Supposed to be dead"
is starting to be

1:35:16.351 --> 1:35:17.985
a recurring theme around here.

1:35:42.582 --> 1:35:45.248
- Just...hold on.

1:35:46.748 --> 1:35:48.615
Please.

1:35:58.147 --> 1:35:59.780
It's my license.

1:36:08.080 --> 1:36:10.679
It was at the ice rink.

1:36:10.745 --> 1:36:11.980
The other pictures
didn't come out

1:36:12.013 --> 1:36:14.845
so I tore that one off for you.

1:36:14.980 --> 1:36:16.812
After you died,

1:36:16.879 --> 1:36:20.112
your father gave that to me.

1:36:23.112 --> 1:36:25.878
- Lydia was there.

1:36:25.979 --> 1:36:27.478
- And Stiles.

1:36:29.811 --> 1:36:32.344
Remember the winter formal?

1:36:35.044 --> 1:36:36.978
- I went with my friends,

1:36:37.044 --> 1:36:40.110
Jackson and Lydia.

1:36:40.177 --> 1:36:42.842
I don't remember anybody else.

1:36:42.977 --> 1:36:44.776
- I was there.

1:36:46.676 --> 1:36:50.609
And I found you inside,
and we danced.

1:36:54.176 --> 1:36:56.476
- I don't remember any of that.

1:36:58.641 --> 1:37:00.641
- We kissed.

1:37:03.241 --> 1:37:06.275
And that was the first time
I told you that I loved you.

1:37:09.474 --> 1:37:11.740
- Why did you do that?

1:37:12.240 --> 1:37:14.274
- Because I love you.

1:37:15.574 --> 1:37:16.773
When you broke up with me,

1:37:16.839 --> 1:37:21.839
I said I knew we were
gonna be together.

1:37:21.974 --> 1:37:25.139
And you told me...

1:37:25.206 --> 1:37:27.639
"There's no such thing as fate."

1:37:31.472 --> 1:37:34.505
Do you remember what
I told you back?

1:37:40.671 --> 1:37:42.604
- "There's no such thing
as a werewolf."

1:37:48.104 --> 1:37:49.604
- Tell me the rest.

1:37:49.671 --> 1:37:52.870
- I can't, because I'm going
to die if you don't help me.

1:37:52.971 --> 1:37:55.171
- What do I have to do?

1:37:55.236 --> 1:37:58.136
- Wolfsbane only responds
to fire.

1:37:58.203 --> 1:38:01.769
You've got to burn it out.

1:38:03.970 --> 1:38:10.269
- A man looks at a photograph
of another man.

1:38:10.335 --> 1:38:15.235
He says, "Brothers and sisters
have I none.

1:38:15.302 --> 1:38:21.668
But this man's father
is my father's son."

1:38:25.567 --> 1:38:28.234
Who is the man
in the photograph?

1:38:28.300 --> 1:38:29.700
- My son.

1:38:29.767 --> 1:38:31.333
- Ah.

1:38:36.233 --> 1:38:37.967
- Don't be afraid.

1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:40.699
- Oh, of this guy? No, no way.

1:38:40.766 --> 1:38:44.399
Oh, my God, he's touching me.

1:38:44.466 --> 1:38:48.299
- The son of Derek Hale.

1:38:48.366 --> 1:38:53.765
But not a wolf yet, is he?

1:38:53.831 --> 1:38:56.298
When night falls,

1:38:56.365 --> 1:39:00.730
he may earn his fangs,
his claws,

1:39:00.797 --> 1:39:03.164
watching the rest of you die!

1:39:16.863 --> 1:39:18.396
- Whoa, uh...

1:39:18.463 --> 1:39:22.129
you couldn't find a lighter?

1:39:22.196 --> 1:39:25.029
- Do you want to live or not?

1:39:26.128 --> 1:39:28.162
- Burn it out.

1:40:07.225 --> 1:40:08.824
- Eli, did you see that?

1:40:08.891 --> 1:40:10.391
Did you see your eyes?

1:40:10.458 --> 1:40:11.491
- How the hell am I supposed
to see my eyes?

1:40:11.558 --> 1:40:12.691
They're the things I use to see.

1:40:12.758 --> 1:40:14.924
- They were glowing.
- What?

1:40:14.991 --> 1:40:16.124
They were?
- Yes.

1:40:20.091 --> 1:40:21.423
- Oh.

1:40:21.490 --> 1:40:23.123
- Wait, don't!

1:40:24.257 --> 1:40:27.923
- Tell me, Eli,

1:40:27.990 --> 1:40:29.556
do you like riddles?

1:40:29.622 --> 1:40:30.889
- I'm more of a limerick
kind of guy.

1:40:30.957 --> 1:40:33.456
You know, I like the rhyming.

1:40:34.822 --> 1:40:37.821
- Finstock, thanks for
reminding everyone here

1:40:37.888 --> 1:40:40.821
that no team chokes
quite like Beacon Hills.

1:40:40.888 --> 1:40:41.989
- We're still up, Hogan.

1:40:43.688 --> 1:40:44.621
Shit!

1:40:50.321 --> 1:40:51.487
- I need to find my father.

1:40:51.554 --> 1:40:53.687
If he's here,
he's in danger too.

1:40:55.087 --> 1:40:58.454
- Allison, wait.

1:40:58.520 --> 1:41:02.819
Look, this isn't
just about us anymore.

1:41:03.653 --> 1:41:06.053
- I think I remember you,

1:41:06.119 --> 1:41:07.586
or maybe someone like you,

1:41:07.653 --> 1:41:09.386
maybe someone
I was in love with.

1:41:09.453 --> 1:41:12.453
And maybe--
maybe if I had more time,

1:41:12.518 --> 1:41:13.953
I would remember everything.

1:41:14.019 --> 1:41:16.785
But I can't help you right now.
I have to find my father.

1:41:16.852 --> 1:41:20.052
I think he might be
the only one I have left.

1:41:20.118 --> 1:41:21.585
- Yeah.

1:41:31.184 --> 1:41:36.716
- Let's put one of the players
back in the game.

1:41:36.783 --> 1:41:38.951
- No!

1:41:57.514 --> 1:42:00.714
- Allison.
Hey! Allison, Allison.

1:42:00.781 --> 1:42:02.214
They don't know that it's you.

1:42:02.281 --> 1:42:04.181
Not even your own father.

1:42:04.248 --> 1:42:06.813
So just...

1:42:06.948 --> 1:42:09.480
be careful.

1:42:09.547 --> 1:42:11.313
- I just tried to kill you,

1:42:11.380 --> 1:42:14.713
and you're telling me
to be careful.

1:42:14.780 --> 1:42:16.413
Why would you do that?

1:42:20.412 --> 1:42:23.379
- Because I'm still in love
with you.

1:42:37.478 --> 1:42:38.710
- Eli!

1:42:38.777 --> 1:42:40.945
Where the hell
did you come from?

1:42:41.011 --> 1:42:42.245
Get off the--hey!

1:42:42.311 --> 1:42:43.844
Off the field!

1:42:43.945 --> 1:42:46.710
Get off the field! Look at you!

1:42:46.777 --> 1:42:47.944
- Eli?

1:42:52.543 --> 1:42:54.944
- It's happening now.

1:42:54.977 --> 1:42:57.409
The mountain ash is more
than a barrier.

1:42:57.476 --> 1:42:59.243
It's a gateway between
his world and ours.

1:42:59.309 --> 1:43:02.409
- Oh, I really hate when you
say shit like that.

1:43:02.476 --> 1:43:04.642
Isn't it just ash?

1:43:08.675 --> 1:43:10.608
- Parrish has to break
the barrier.

1:43:10.675 --> 1:43:12.075
He's the only one
that can do it.

1:43:14.275 --> 1:43:16.374
Jackson.

1:43:16.942 --> 1:43:19.641
- OK, so it's a place,
but it's not real.

1:43:19.707 --> 1:43:21.107
They're all there with my dad,

1:43:21.174 --> 1:43:23.074
and they're alive.
- This part of the game?

1:43:23.141 --> 1:43:24.640
It's like he's knocking
pieces off the board.

1:43:24.706 --> 1:43:26.074
- So how come he put me
back on it?

1:43:26.141 --> 1:43:27.241
- I don't know, but I need to
get you out of here.

1:43:27.306 --> 1:43:28.706
Come on.

1:43:28.773 --> 1:43:31.640
- Oh! What the hell was that?

1:43:31.706 --> 1:43:33.573
- Mountain ash.

1:43:43.939 --> 1:43:45.605
- It's him.

1:43:45.671 --> 1:43:46.972
It's really him.

1:43:47.039 --> 1:43:48.939
- It's him who?

1:43:48.939 --> 1:43:50.939
- Adrian Harris.

1:43:50.939 --> 1:43:52.771
- He kind of looks like
our chemistry teacher.

1:43:52.838 --> 1:43:55.004
- I was your chemistry teacher,
Jackson,

1:43:55.071 --> 1:43:56.238
you fucking imbecile.

1:43:57.971 --> 1:44:01.503
- Do it. Scream, Lydia.
Scream like a banshee.

1:44:01.570 --> 1:44:02.703
Oh. Oh, that's right.

1:44:02.770 --> 1:44:05.437
You haven't screamed in years,
have you?

1:44:05.503 --> 1:44:06.437
- What do you want from us?

1:44:06.503 --> 1:44:08.537
- Well, I don't want an apology,

1:44:08.602 --> 1:44:09.970
seeing as how
you ruined my life,

1:44:10.037 --> 1:44:11.769
and you served me up
as a human sacrifice

1:44:11.836 --> 1:44:13.037
to some demented druid.

1:44:13.103 --> 1:44:15.302
- I was in London
for all of that.

1:44:19.936 --> 1:44:21.535
- The sun's going down.

1:44:21.601 --> 1:44:22.735
If the Oni come out at night--

1:44:22.801 --> 1:44:24.735
- There's 10,000 people
in this stadium.

1:44:24.801 --> 1:44:26.101
What are we supposed to do?

1:44:26.168 --> 1:44:27.535
- Come on.

1:44:27.601 --> 1:44:28.800
Hey, Coach?

1:44:28.935 --> 1:44:29.968
- Come on.
- Coach!

1:44:30.035 --> 1:44:31.135
Coach, hey!

1:44:31.201 --> 1:44:32.268
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1:44:32.335 --> 1:44:33.467
Unacceptable.

1:44:33.534 --> 1:44:34.767
You graduated, McCall.

1:44:34.834 --> 1:44:36.334
You're not ruining this for me.

1:44:36.400 --> 1:44:39.234
- Coach, every single person
in this stadium is in danger.

1:44:39.300 --> 1:44:41.134
Is there any way to get them out
without panicking them?

1:44:41.200 --> 1:44:42.533
- Yeah, you win the game.

1:44:42.599 --> 1:44:44.167
- What happens
if they tie it up?

1:44:44.234 --> 1:44:45.100
- Sudden death.

1:44:45.167 --> 1:44:46.399
- Coach,

1:44:46.466 --> 1:44:47.833
there's gonna be
10,000 sudden deaths

1:44:47.934 --> 1:44:49.966
if we don't stop this game.

1:44:55.233 --> 1:44:56.365
- Crap!

1:44:56.432 --> 1:44:57.632
I haven't felt this level
of disappointment

1:44:57.698 --> 1:44:59.232
since I lost my virginity.

1:44:59.298 --> 1:45:00.832
You want to help us win, McCall?

1:45:04.132 --> 1:45:06.032
Here.

1:45:12.964 --> 1:45:16.931
Four minutes,
whoever scores first wins.

1:45:16.931 --> 1:45:19.363
- Number 11?
That used to be my number.

1:45:19.430 --> 1:45:20.496
- Do you want it back?

1:45:20.563 --> 1:45:22.263
- No, no. That's OK.

1:45:22.330 --> 1:45:23.663
Just, if you're gonna wear
my number, you better score.

1:45:23.730 --> 1:45:24.930
- I'll try.

1:45:24.930 --> 1:45:26.463
- Let's go! Let's do it!

1:45:26.530 --> 1:45:28.363
Asses on the field!

1:45:28.429 --> 1:45:31.195
We score first!

1:45:34.029 --> 1:45:36.495
- Come take a look, Lydia.

1:45:37.761 --> 1:45:38.995
- This was no small
accomplishment.

1:45:39.062 --> 1:45:40.962
This illusion has
several layers.

1:45:41.029 --> 1:45:43.594
Here, Lydia,
let me show you one.

1:45:43.661 --> 1:45:44.928
- You want me to watch
a lacrosse game?

1:45:44.961 --> 1:45:46.461
- No, no.

1:45:46.528 --> 1:45:48.961
I want you to watch
your friends die.

1:45:49.028 --> 1:45:50.493
Come on.

1:45:50.560 --> 1:45:51.627
Take a look through
the microscope.

1:46:01.826 --> 1:46:03.292
- You didn't change.

1:46:05.192 --> 1:46:06.192
- What?

1:46:06.259 --> 1:46:07.326
- When they took Eli,

1:46:07.392 --> 1:46:09.226
you didn't change.

1:46:09.292 --> 1:46:13.391
- He means you didn't transform
in front of your son.

1:46:13.458 --> 1:46:14.825
- I haven't.

1:46:14.926 --> 1:46:18.658
He hasn't seen me like that.

1:46:18.725 --> 1:46:20.690
Not since the first time.

1:46:20.757 --> 1:46:23.058
- OK, what was the first time?

1:46:23.125 --> 1:46:26.624
- I don't know
if he'd even remembers.

1:46:26.690 --> 1:46:28.757
He might have been too young.

1:46:28.824 --> 1:46:30.090
Coyotes had come into the house.

1:46:30.157 --> 1:46:32.723
They clawed through
the screen door.

1:46:32.789 --> 1:46:34.157
Eli was playing on the floor,

1:46:34.224 --> 1:46:37.823
and they were heading
straight for him.

1:46:37.924 --> 1:46:41.656
I transformed instantly.

1:46:41.723 --> 1:46:44.788
Roared so loud it shook
the entire house.

1:46:44.923 --> 1:46:49.388
Coyotes took off
and there was Eli,

1:46:49.455 --> 1:46:51.222
looking up at me.

1:46:53.955 --> 1:46:56.288
He was shaking.
He was--

1:46:56.355 --> 1:47:00.121
he was terrified.

1:47:00.187 --> 1:47:05.254
And he wouldn't let me
come near him for days.

1:47:05.321 --> 1:47:08.786
That look of fear in his eyes
when he saw me,

1:47:08.921 --> 1:47:10.987
I couldn't get it
out of my head.

1:47:11.054 --> 1:47:14.153
- That's why he can't change.

1:47:14.220 --> 1:47:17.953
- I think every time
he starts to, or...

1:47:18.020 --> 1:47:21.920
maybe every time he tries,

1:47:21.920 --> 1:47:25.352
he must see my face...

1:47:25.419 --> 1:47:27.352
snarling back at him.

1:47:36.684 --> 1:47:38.451
- Get it to McCall! To McCall!

1:47:38.518 --> 1:47:41.051
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1:47:47.283 --> 1:47:48.983
Whoa. Sh--

1:47:53.749 --> 1:47:56.382
- I knew the Nogitsune
was too chaotic

1:47:56.449 --> 1:47:58.516
to play this game on his own.

1:47:58.582 --> 1:48:01.382
He needed me to help him win.

1:48:01.449 --> 1:48:03.249
All I had to do was
give him my pain.

1:48:03.316 --> 1:48:05.548
Thanks to you and Scott McCall,

1:48:05.615 --> 1:48:06.715
I have plenty.

1:48:06.781 --> 1:48:09.248
We all have pain.

1:48:09.315 --> 1:48:12.115
- But Lydia's pain is
particularly appealing

1:48:12.181 --> 1:48:13.614
to a thousand-year-old demon.

1:48:13.680 --> 1:48:15.514
- My pain isn't anything to him.

1:48:15.580 --> 1:48:19.180
- On the contrary, heartbreak
is a veritable delicacy

1:48:19.247 --> 1:48:20.147
to the Nogitsune.

1:48:20.214 --> 1:48:22.914
So give him a taste, Lydia.

1:48:22.947 --> 1:48:24.980
Tell us why you left Stiles.

1:48:25.047 --> 1:48:26.446
- Give us your pain,

1:48:26.513 --> 1:48:29.579
or the next time,
I shoot Jackson in the head.

1:48:29.646 --> 1:48:31.013
- No. Lydia.

1:48:31.079 --> 1:48:32.579
Lydia, don't do it.

1:48:32.646 --> 1:48:34.413
Don't do it!

1:48:34.479 --> 1:48:37.412
- I left.

1:48:37.478 --> 1:48:38.712
I left because of a dream.

1:48:38.778 --> 1:48:40.678
- What happened in the dream?

1:48:40.745 --> 1:48:42.245
- My eyes open...

1:48:45.545 --> 1:48:47.912
And I see broken glass.

1:48:51.012 --> 1:48:53.144
It's from a windshield.

1:48:55.644 --> 1:48:59.077
And I'm crawling
on the pavement.

1:49:01.077 --> 1:49:03.943
I'm trying to reach Stiles.

1:49:06.543 --> 1:49:09.410
There was a crash.

1:49:10.809 --> 1:49:14.142
We'd been thrown from the car.

1:49:17.109 --> 1:49:20.409
Except he's not moving.

1:49:21.641 --> 1:49:24.909
He wasn't blinking.

1:49:24.942 --> 1:49:25.909
He wasn't breathing.

1:49:25.974 --> 1:49:28.908
- Lydia, it was just a dream.

1:49:28.974 --> 1:49:31.740
- Until it happened again.

1:49:31.807 --> 1:49:35.640
And again.

1:49:35.707 --> 1:49:39.040
Becomes this recurring dream

1:49:39.107 --> 1:49:41.107
until I can't tell anymore
that if it's a dream--

1:49:41.173 --> 1:49:42.506
- Or a premonition.

1:49:44.007 --> 1:49:45.806
- If I was never in
the car with him,

1:49:45.907 --> 1:49:49.939
there wouldn't have to be
a crash.

1:49:50.006 --> 1:49:52.072
And he wouldn't have to die.

1:49:52.139 --> 1:49:54.505
- And you wouldn't
have to scream.

1:49:54.571 --> 1:49:58.039
- Banshees don't scream.

1:49:59.905 --> 1:50:03.171
They wail.

1:50:09.304 --> 1:50:10.404
- New plan.

1:50:10.470 --> 1:50:11.670
You take the shot.
I'll cover you.

1:50:11.737 --> 1:50:13.204
- Are you kidding?
- No, it's your shot!

1:50:13.270 --> 1:50:14.237
Come on.

1:50:14.304 --> 1:50:15.904
- Where did this kid come from?

1:50:15.970 --> 1:50:18.237
Is he even in high school?

1:50:18.303 --> 1:50:19.636
- That's one of my best
students.

1:50:19.703 --> 1:50:20.904
- He looks like he's 30.

1:50:20.970 --> 1:50:22.403
Who the hell is that?

1:50:23.835 --> 1:50:25.036
- That's Greenberg.

1:50:26.903 --> 1:50:28.969
- What do you hear?

1:50:29.036 --> 1:50:31.069
- It's like the game's happening
right next to us.

1:50:31.135 --> 1:50:32.935
- I can hear it too.

1:50:33.002 --> 1:50:34.468
I think my son's on the field.

1:50:36.035 --> 1:50:37.868
- Yes! Take it!

1:50:37.935 --> 1:50:40.367
Eli, take it to the rack!

1:50:48.501 --> 1:50:51.167
Whoo!

1:50:51.234 --> 1:50:52.500
- Yes!

1:50:52.733 --> 1:50:53.867
- Yes!

1:50:55.733 --> 1:50:57.333
- Holy shit!

1:50:57.400 --> 1:50:59.033
Scott, did you see that?
Did you me score?

1:50:59.100 --> 1:51:01.233
My dad was actually right.
I'm actually pretty good.

1:51:03.900 --> 1:51:05.900
Oh, my God, my dad.

1:51:05.900 --> 1:51:07.265
- This isn't over.

1:51:07.332 --> 1:51:09.399
- We're gonna find the others.
Come on.

1:51:09.465 --> 1:51:11.498
- Peter! Wait!

1:51:11.564 --> 1:51:12.932
- No! No!

1:51:12.999 --> 1:51:14.132
No more illusions.

1:51:14.198 --> 1:51:16.731
- Where's Scott? Where's my son?

1:51:16.798 --> 1:51:18.064
- He's on the field.

1:51:18.131 --> 1:51:19.763
He's trying to save everyone.

1:51:19.898 --> 1:51:21.198
He's playing the game.

1:51:21.264 --> 1:51:23.098
- That most definitely
sounds like your son.

1:51:23.164 --> 1:51:24.530
But as for your daughter--

1:51:24.597 --> 1:51:26.497
- I forgot to tell you
something, Peter.

1:51:26.563 --> 1:51:28.763
The arrow wasn't the only thing
Allison left behind.

1:51:38.030 --> 1:51:39.596
- Wolfsbane.

1:51:47.395 --> 1:51:50.495
- You think I wouldn't recognize
my own daughter?

1:51:50.561 --> 1:51:52.395
It is you.

1:51:52.461 --> 1:51:53.995
- I don't know.

1:51:54.061 --> 1:51:56.061
I don't know who or what I am.

1:51:56.128 --> 1:51:57.660
But my friends are in trouble
and it's all my fault.

1:51:57.727 --> 1:51:59.095
- No.

1:52:02.760 --> 1:52:04.659
Dad, what's that?

1:52:10.960 --> 1:52:13.426
- Allison?

1:52:19.959 --> 1:52:22.926
- The real tournament begins.

1:52:26.791 --> 1:52:28.724
- Where are we?

1:52:28.791 --> 1:52:30.691
- We're in his world.

1:52:34.657 --> 1:52:35.957
- This is it.

1:52:36.024 --> 1:52:38.723
They're here.
They're all trapped here.

1:52:38.790 --> 1:52:40.391
- So are we.

1:52:42.590 --> 1:52:44.390
- Something's happening.

1:52:44.456 --> 1:52:46.623
- I think it already happened.

1:53:04.788 --> 1:53:07.321
- I've killed Oni before.

1:53:07.388 --> 1:53:09.088
- Then let's kill a few more.

1:53:28.352 --> 1:53:29.887
- You can burn through this,
right?

1:53:29.887 --> 1:53:31.619
You've done it before.

1:53:31.686 --> 1:53:33.186
- That was years ago.

1:53:33.252 --> 1:53:34.219
The amount of power
this is gonna take,

1:53:34.286 --> 1:53:36.119
I don't know if I can do it.

1:53:36.186 --> 1:53:37.919
- OK. What do you need?

1:53:37.986 --> 1:53:39.119
You need a pep talk?

1:53:39.185 --> 1:53:41.485
One of those "you can do this"
speeches?

1:53:41.551 --> 1:53:44.885
I don't do speeches.
I don't do pep talks.

1:53:44.885 --> 1:53:46.418
I'm not here to boost your ego.

1:53:46.484 --> 1:53:47.885
And I'm not gonna be
your cheerleader.

1:53:47.951 --> 1:53:50.184
So whatever you need to do
to get your shit together,

1:53:50.250 --> 1:53:51.350
you gotta do this for yourself

1:53:51.417 --> 1:53:54.184
and you gotta do this right now.

1:53:54.250 --> 1:53:57.250
You are a hellhound
that burns hellfire.

1:53:57.317 --> 1:53:59.217
Now burn this fucker up!

1:54:22.882 --> 1:54:24.114
- We can't get loose.

1:54:24.181 --> 1:54:26.247
- Dad.

1:54:26.314 --> 1:54:28.147
- Parrish, we need to
buy him more time.

1:54:28.214 --> 1:54:29.414
- Go ahead, Lydia.

1:54:29.481 --> 1:54:31.513
Watch your friends suffer.

1:54:36.713 --> 1:54:38.680
- Look out!

1:54:52.245 --> 1:54:54.879
- Fight, Allison. Come on.

1:54:54.912 --> 1:54:56.611
- She'll hear you.

1:54:56.678 --> 1:54:58.879
Mountain ash doesn't work
on banshees.

1:55:21.142 --> 1:55:24.476
- Allison is alive.

1:55:24.542 --> 1:55:26.541
Your best friend is alive,

1:55:26.608 --> 1:55:29.109
and she's out there
fighting for her life.

1:55:29.176 --> 1:55:30.942
Don't lose her again.

1:55:31.009 --> 1:55:34.308
She'll hear you.

1:55:34.375 --> 1:55:37.241
Lydia, she'll hear you.

1:55:39.774 --> 1:55:42.008
Allison!

1:57:37.564 --> 1:57:41.130
I remember.

1:57:41.197 --> 1:57:43.363
I remember everything.

1:57:43.429 --> 1:57:47.728
- We're not done yet.

1:57:47.863 --> 1:57:52.163
The game is mine.

1:57:58.328 --> 1:57:59.862
- Take me.

1:57:59.862 --> 1:58:01.462
Let the others go.

1:58:01.527 --> 1:58:05.862
- All the lives here
belong to me.

1:58:05.928 --> 1:58:07.027
- All you need is me.

1:58:07.094 --> 1:58:09.861
- Scott, don't do this.

1:58:09.927 --> 1:58:12.861
- Allison kills me,
I die in her arms,

1:58:12.927 --> 1:58:14.760
the same way that
she died in mine.

1:58:14.861 --> 1:58:16.593
That's the move that wins
the game, isn't it?

1:58:16.660 --> 1:58:19.060
- I've already won.

1:58:19.126 --> 1:58:22.960
You lose!
Until I'm off the board!

1:58:23.026 --> 1:58:24.860
And I'm still standing.

1:58:24.926 --> 1:58:26.226
And I'm still the alpha.

1:58:26.292 --> 1:58:28.625
An arrow to the heart

1:58:28.692 --> 1:58:32.659
to save everyone else?

1:58:32.724 --> 1:58:36.092
- All the other players

1:58:36.159 --> 1:58:38.724
go free.

1:58:49.024 --> 1:58:50.091
- No.

1:58:50.157 --> 1:58:52.890
No, I can't.

1:58:52.957 --> 1:58:54.457
I--I can't--

1:58:54.523 --> 1:58:56.323
I cannot--no.

1:58:56.390 --> 1:58:58.522
- No.

1:58:58.589 --> 1:59:01.389
- Kill him, Allison,

1:59:01.456 --> 1:59:04.922
and I win the game.

1:59:04.989 --> 1:59:06.721
- Allison, please.

1:59:06.856 --> 1:59:08.956
Don't make me watch
my friends and my family die.

1:59:27.354 --> 1:59:33.120
- Game is mine!

1:59:33.187 --> 1:59:36.553
Kill him!

2:00:30.849 --> 2:00:33.148
Something tells me
this isn't over.

2:00:33.214 --> 2:00:36.448
- I certainly hope not.

2:00:36.513 --> 2:00:38.248
- Scream all you want, Lydia.

2:00:38.314 --> 2:00:40.048
- No!
- The game is over.

2:00:43.413 --> 2:00:47.746
- The wolves howl to
signal their position...

2:00:47.813 --> 2:00:51.047
- To the rest of the pack.

2:00:51.113 --> 2:00:56.046
Tell me, Scott McCall,

2:00:56.112 --> 2:01:00.112
what is the sound

2:01:00.179 --> 2:01:05.111
of the wolf who is ready to die?

2:01:05.178 --> 2:01:08.211
- I'd tell you,

2:01:08.278 --> 2:01:09.845
but I'm not ready to die.

2:01:29.609 --> 2:01:32.243
- Fox fire.

2:02:25.703 --> 2:02:27.838
- What is that?

2:02:27.871 --> 2:02:30.204
- Silver, you motherfucker.

2:03:04.534 --> 2:03:06.467
- Come on, come on.

2:03:08.434 --> 2:03:09.934
- OK. Stop. Stop.

2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:11.267
The only way we can
break the bonds

2:03:11.334 --> 2:03:13.599
is with our strength combined,
you and me.

2:03:13.666 --> 2:03:15.566
- What strength?
I don't have any strength.

2:03:15.633 --> 2:03:17.099
- Your will as a wolf.

2:03:17.166 --> 2:03:19.199
We do it together.

2:03:20.566 --> 2:03:22.966
You're my son.

2:03:23.033 --> 2:03:24.199
You're a Hale.

2:03:28.432 --> 2:03:30.298
A werewolf.

2:03:38.932 --> 2:03:41.264
Go!

2:03:55.562 --> 2:03:57.729
- Mason! Sheriff!

2:04:17.528 --> 2:04:18.828
- No!

2:04:24.527 --> 2:04:26.827
Do you remember, Scott,

2:04:26.860 --> 2:04:29.827
the gift that you gave me?

2:04:29.827 --> 2:04:34.559
The bite of the alpha,

2:04:34.626 --> 2:04:39.959
the power of the werewolf.

2:05:36.921 --> 2:05:39.620
- Derek, it's not real.

2:05:39.686 --> 2:05:41.520
- It's just another illusion.

2:05:41.586 --> 2:05:42.520
- Dad?

2:05:42.586 --> 2:05:44.486
- Eli?

2:05:44.553 --> 2:05:45.853
Eli, can you hear me?

2:05:48.452 --> 2:05:49.452
- Yeah.

2:05:49.519 --> 2:05:51.485
Yeah, I can hear you.

2:05:58.819 --> 2:06:00.052
- Eli!

2:06:21.050 --> 2:06:23.983
- Harris had his chance.

2:06:24.050 --> 2:06:26.516
Now it's my turn,

2:06:26.582 --> 2:06:29.582
my revenge.

2:06:29.649 --> 2:06:34.182
I'm going to kill them all,

2:06:34.248 --> 2:06:37.981
starting with this child
right here.

2:06:38.048 --> 2:06:40.815
- You wanna kill someone,
start with me!

2:06:48.647 --> 2:06:49.680
- We can't fight him alone.

2:06:49.815 --> 2:06:50.980
He's too strong.

2:06:51.047 --> 2:06:52.080
We have to break the illusion.

2:06:52.147 --> 2:06:53.546
We have to catch him.

2:06:53.613 --> 2:06:55.947
- You can't catch me.

2:06:56.014 --> 2:06:59.513
You can't kill me.

2:06:59.579 --> 2:07:03.612
You can't even find me.

2:07:03.678 --> 2:07:05.413
- You're right.

2:07:05.478 --> 2:07:07.813
We can't find you...

2:07:07.813 --> 2:07:10.212
but we can find each other.

2:07:10.278 --> 2:07:12.812
- A wolf howls
to signal its pack.

2:07:12.812 --> 2:07:14.378
- What about a werewolf?

2:07:15.812 --> 2:07:17.145
- A werewolf roars.

2:07:52.341 --> 2:07:54.408
- Hey, hold him!
We gotta hold him!

2:07:54.474 --> 2:07:56.341
- You can't!
You'll both burn up with him!

2:08:15.539 --> 2:08:17.372
- Scott!
- What?

2:08:17.439 --> 2:08:19.172
- You're the alpha.

2:08:19.239 --> 2:08:20.639
He's part of your pack now.

2:08:41.870 --> 2:08:43.437
- Parrish!

2:08:43.504 --> 2:08:44.569
Light this fucker up.

2:09:00.969 --> 2:09:02.102
- Dad?

2:10:16.728 --> 2:10:18.395
- Here, let me help you.

2:10:23.660 --> 2:10:25.427
- Hikari!
- Liam!

2:10:56.724 --> 2:10:59.158
- Lydia.
- Allison!

2:11:39.554 --> 2:11:43.587
- The first night
I met Derek Hale,

2:11:43.653 --> 2:11:44.687
he saved my life.

2:11:47.420 --> 2:11:49.788
Then he said we were brothers,

2:11:49.853 --> 2:11:54.187
and I thought that he was crazy.

2:11:54.253 --> 2:11:57.386
But no. No, he was right.

2:11:59.552 --> 2:12:03.219
Eli, from that moment on,
we were brothers.

2:12:04.786 --> 2:12:06.685
And, uh...

2:12:06.786 --> 2:12:10.251
Derek Hale was the first person
to teach me that

2:12:10.318 --> 2:12:14.617
you don't just get the family
that you were born with.

2:12:16.517 --> 2:12:18.450
You get the family
that you find.

2:12:21.350 --> 2:12:22.984
- You know, I'm not sure
how your dad would feel

2:12:23.050 --> 2:12:24.517
about me giving you the Jeep.

2:12:24.584 --> 2:12:29.283
But, um, something tells me
it's the right thing to do.

2:12:29.349 --> 2:12:31.249
- He hated that Jeep.

2:12:31.316 --> 2:12:33.649
- After my son left it behind,

2:12:33.784 --> 2:12:37.483
Derek towed it in, thinking it
was probably beyond repair.

2:12:37.548 --> 2:12:39.482
But then he opened up the hood
and he pulled off

2:12:39.548 --> 2:12:42.783
all the duct tape
Stiles had stuck on it.

2:12:42.816 --> 2:12:44.648
And he managed to fix it.

2:12:46.515 --> 2:12:48.547
- That Jeep,

2:12:48.614 --> 2:12:50.982
no matter
what's been done to it,

2:12:51.048 --> 2:12:53.614
it just keeps running.

2:12:53.681 --> 2:12:56.681
He could never figure out
why it wouldn't break down

2:12:56.781 --> 2:13:00.147
and stay down.

2:13:00.214 --> 2:13:01.446
And I don't think
he ever realized that

2:13:01.513 --> 2:13:04.280
that's exactly
the way we saw him.

2:13:04.346 --> 2:13:07.546
I have never seen anyone

2:13:07.613 --> 2:13:10.780
take the kind of punishment
that Derek Hale took...

2:13:13.780 --> 2:13:15.579
And kept taking...

2:13:16.846 --> 2:13:18.645
In order to protect
the people he loved.

2:13:45.642 --> 2:13:48.309
- He kept standing back up...

2:14:02.908 --> 2:14:06.775
- Until the day he couldn't.

2:14:06.808 --> 2:14:08.407
Hey.

2:14:08.474 --> 2:14:12.607
Your dad had complicated
feelings about that Jeep.

2:14:12.674 --> 2:14:16.074
But it doesn't mean it needs
to be complicated for you.

2:14:16.140 --> 2:14:19.774
All you got to do...

2:14:19.807 --> 2:14:22.206
is keep it running.

2:14:22.273 --> 2:14:24.873
Just keep it going.

2:14:57.503 --> 2:14:59.603
- Don't get too attached.

2:15:01.203 --> 2:15:03.770
- We got adoptions on Saturday.

2:15:03.770 --> 2:15:05.003
- Eventually him.

2:15:05.070 --> 2:15:06.369
- I know you're gonna be
tempted,

2:15:06.435 --> 2:15:08.969
but not a lot of treats.
He's still growing dog.

2:15:09.035 --> 2:15:10.902
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

2:15:10.969 --> 2:15:12.135
- He's pretty heavy already.

2:15:12.202 --> 2:15:14.102
- When he's ready.

2:15:14.169 --> 2:15:15.568
Hi.

2:15:20.101 --> 2:15:21.634
- I have this feeling.

2:15:21.768 --> 2:15:24.234
It's like,
all this time has passed

2:15:24.301 --> 2:15:26.768
and I want to figure out
how to get it back.

2:15:27.467 --> 2:15:29.001
Like, I'm happy for everything
that's ahead of me,

2:15:29.067 --> 2:15:32.167
but I--I just--

2:15:32.233 --> 2:15:36.100
I feel this kind of regret,
you know?

2:15:36.167 --> 2:15:38.767
I think--

2:15:38.767 --> 2:15:40.366
I think I feel...

2:15:42.366 --> 2:15:44.399
- Wistful.

2:15:46.966 --> 2:15:48.498
- Yeah, that's exactly it.

2:15:51.265 --> 2:15:53.398
Do you feel that way?

2:15:56.865 --> 2:15:58.798
- No.

2:16:00.765 --> 2:16:04.130
I'm not worried about the past,

2:16:04.197 --> 2:16:08.330
because now I have a future.

2:16:08.397 --> 2:16:10.930
With him.

2:16:10.997 --> 2:16:12.629
And you.

2:16:22.495 --> 2:16:25.896
- OK, quiet.

2:16:45.426 --> 2:16:48.226
- Why did we stop?

2:16:48.293 --> 2:16:50.426
Hey, I thought--I thought
I was gonna go see my lawyer.

2:16:53.793 --> 2:16:55.625
Hey.

2:16:55.760 --> 2:16:57.026
Hey!

2:16:57.092 --> 2:16:58.492
Hey, hey, hey!

2:17:05.658 --> 2:17:06.925
Hey.

2:17:06.992 --> 2:17:08.491
Hey!

2:17:08.558 --> 2:17:09.658
Who the hell are you?

2:17:09.759 --> 2:17:11.524
Whoa, whoa, hey!
No, hey!

2:17:11.591 --> 2:17:13.358
What's--what's going on?

2:17:17.158 --> 2:17:18.490
Get your hands off me!

2:17:18.557 --> 2:17:22.057
Hey, come on!
Get your hands off--

2:17:22.123 --> 2:17:23.657
- Good evening, Mr. Harris.

2:17:23.757 --> 2:17:25.490
There's been a change of plans.

2:17:25.556 --> 2:17:27.456
It's been decided that
you'll be placed at

2:17:27.522 --> 2:17:29.890
a far more suitable
detention facility.

2:17:29.957 --> 2:17:31.222
- What kind of facility?

2:17:31.289 --> 2:17:33.422
- The Eichen.

2:17:33.489 --> 2:17:35.122
- I think you'll be
very comfortable there.

2:17:35.189 --> 2:17:36.555
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

2:17:36.621 --> 2:17:39.256
No, God! No, no, no! No!

2:17:39.321 --> 2:17:41.188
No! It's some kind of mistake!

2:17:41.255 --> 2:17:43.355
No! I'm a high school teacher!

2:17:43.421 --> 2:17:45.221
Come on, the kids,
the teenagers,

2:17:45.288 --> 2:17:46.921
they're werewolves!

2:17:46.988 --> 2:17:49.088
- Trust me.

2:17:49.155 --> 2:17:52.454
We've heard plenty of stories
about teenage werewolves.

2:17:54.554 --> 2:17:56.487
There's always a new one.

2:18:16.786 --> 2:18:20.085
- Remember who you are.
