00:02.268 --> 00:02.501
.

00:02.503 --> 00:04.019
- Called around on
your ex-partner, jen cassidy.

00:04.019 --> 00:05.536
Word is she's a great cop.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.172
- I fell in love with her.

00:07.174 --> 00:08.574
Like an idiot.

00:08.576 --> 00:10.376
- I want you so bad right now.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.611
- My place. One hour.

00:12.613 --> 00:15.314
- How does running your own task
force for the feds sound?

00:15.316 --> 00:16.482
- Task force?

00:16.483 --> 00:17.649
- Which i'm keeping
confidential.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.318
- You can go after any cases
you want, erin.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.488
You could be going places.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.256
I'll need to know
by next friday.

00:24.258 --> 00:26.291
Then i move on.

00:32.033 --> 00:35.401
[tires screeching]

00:41.742 --> 00:43.308
- Nadia?
- [crying]

00:43.310 --> 00:45.778
- Hey. Nadia?

00:45.780 --> 00:47.246
- Watch where you step.

00:47.248 --> 00:48.547
I didn't know where else
to take her.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.049
- Why didn't you call 911?

00:50.051 --> 00:51.617
- Because the paramedics
would've called the cops.

00:51.619 --> 00:54.319
She's gonna be fine, i found
this in your first-aid kit.

00:54.321 --> 00:56.188
Look at me, i need you to look
into my eyes. Okay, elisha?

00:56.190 --> 00:59.491
Look at me.
- What did she take?

01:03.464 --> 01:05.330
- She's a friend of mine
from n.A. Meetings.

01:05.331 --> 01:06.749
She didn't show up for two weeks

01:06.750 --> 01:08.167
And then she called me a half
hour ago,

01:08.169 --> 01:09.234
Tells me she just shot up.

01:09.236 --> 01:10.769
You're starting to spiral.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.471
I got you, elisha.
I'm right here.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.590
- This is detective erin lindsay

01:14.591 --> 01:16.708
I need you to roll an ambo to
1601 south indiana now.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.077
- Copy that.

01:18.079 --> 01:20.079
Elisha.

01:20.081 --> 01:21.447
[knocking on tub]
hey, elisha.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.148
Hey, look at me.

01:23.150 --> 01:24.349
You're okay.
You're gonna be okay.

01:24.351 --> 01:27.519
Look at me.
Tell me where you got this.

01:27.521 --> 01:28.887
It's all right, you're not in
trouble,

01:28.888 --> 01:30.254
I need you to tell me where you
got this.

01:30.257 --> 01:33.659
- You can tell her.

01:33.661 --> 01:34.660
It's okay.

01:34.662 --> 01:37.529
- Tell me where you got this.

01:38.799 --> 01:44.136
[overlapping chatter]

01:49.443 --> 01:51.543
- Everybody down!
- On the ground!

01:51.545 --> 01:55.647
[screaming]
- don't move!

01:55.649 --> 01:57.349
- Keep your hands on the table!
Don't look at me!

01:57.351 --> 01:59.651
All right, i want everyone
to stay where they are.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.186
- I got ten grand in the safe,

02:01.188 --> 02:03.155
Just take it and don't kill
anyone, okay?

02:03.157 --> 02:04.223
- Downstairs!

02:04.224 --> 02:05.290
- I don't know what you think
you've heard,

02:05.292 --> 02:06.391
There's nothing down there.

02:06.393 --> 02:07.626
- Do it!

02:07.628 --> 02:09.360
Move!

02:16.871 --> 02:19.271
Open it!

02:23.210 --> 02:25.277
- You know this is suicide.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.351
- On the floor!
- Everybody get down!

02:32.353 --> 02:33.252
Get down!
- Hustle!

02:33.254 --> 02:34.820
Get down on the ground!

02:34.822 --> 02:36.221
Get your hands behind your back.

02:36.223 --> 02:38.857
Don't move.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.334
- There's no way you're getting
out of here alive.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.628
- All right, we're good!

03:32.246 --> 03:34.279
- Let's go.

03:34.281 --> 03:36.348
- On this side.

03:47.661 --> 03:50.262
- [laughs]
- woo-hoo!

03:50.264 --> 03:53.599
- Did you get it?

03:53.601 --> 03:54.733
- Everybody good?

03:54.735 --> 03:58.403
[gunfire]

04:11.719 --> 04:11.950
.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.919
- [laughs]
- everybody in one piece?

04:13.921 --> 04:15.520
- 20 kilos of pure passion.

04:15.522 --> 04:17.623
- Oh, yeah, it's been a while
since we pulled a rip.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.391
I forgot how much fun it was.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.593
- I've done some pretty crazy
recon missions,

04:21.595 --> 04:25.831
That got my heart pumping.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.899
- You two!

04:30.938 --> 04:33.639
This, uh, confidential informant
of yours--

04:33.641 --> 04:35.507
Elisha nicotero.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.009
Why is she not registered
in our files?

04:37.011 --> 04:38.977
- Sir, elisha's a dancer
at that club.

04:38.979 --> 04:41.446
And she's the one who told me
about the heroin lab.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.415
She said they were getting ready
to move a big shipment

04:43.417 --> 04:44.449
So we had to go quick.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.018
- This brand, passion,

04:46.019 --> 04:47.586
Has killed over a dozen people
the last few months.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.454
Some of them, kids.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.690
We just poked the hornet's nest.

04:51.692 --> 04:53.992
As long as these guys think it
was a rival crew ripped them off

04:53.994 --> 04:56.762
And not the cops, they're gonna
keep talking

04:56.764 --> 05:00.032
Until they take us right to
the top dog.

05:00.034 --> 05:02.351
- [sighs]
do me a favor?

05:02.352 --> 05:04.669
Get a thumb print on your c.I.
So we get her in the books.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.338
- Done.

05:06.340 --> 05:09.641
- That club manager?
He's talking.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.009
- Yo, yo, sarge.
- Yeah?

05:11.011 --> 05:13.512
- Got a wire up on
trenton's phone.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.913
And we got eyes right there on
the club

05:14.915 --> 05:17.516
Through the mini-cam that we
planted across the street.

05:17.518 --> 05:18.784
- Blue.
- That's him.

05:18.786 --> 05:20.686
- Yeah, man.
We got hit.

05:20.688 --> 05:21.787
- The police?

05:21.789 --> 05:23.622
- No. A crew.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.524
Dudes were all blacked out.

05:25.526 --> 05:28.627
They had on masks.
They got the 20 keys.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.028
- All right,
put on a street award.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.698
Ten grand to any hype who coughs
up this crew.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.767
You don't got a name by morning,
it's on you.

05:35.769 --> 05:36.835
- All right, keep listening.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.737
Make your overtime.
- I can do that.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.077
- How's she holding up?

05:45.079 --> 05:48.880
- Nurse said she's finally
stable.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.115
- When elisha comes to
i need you

05:50.117 --> 05:51.750
To get her thumb print
and signature on

05:51.752 --> 05:53.685
These forms for me, all right?

05:53.687 --> 05:55.621
- Yeah. What for?

05:55.622 --> 05:57.556
- It's a technicality.
Just do it.

05:57.558 --> 06:00.726
- Hey, are you mad at me?

06:00.728 --> 06:03.128
I got elisha to tell you about
the club, didn't i?

06:03.130 --> 06:04.796
- I don't appreciate getting
tips from girls

06:04.798 --> 06:06.765
That are overdosing in
my bathtub.

06:06.767 --> 06:10.068
- You're acting like it was me.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.703
- [sighs]

06:11.705 --> 06:13.638
When she comes to,

06:13.640 --> 06:16.108
Just get her thumb print for me,
all right?

06:19.713 --> 06:21.646
[chuckling]

06:21.648 --> 06:23.682
- Hey. Um, sergeant.

06:23.684 --> 06:24.883
I heard intelligence pulled
a rip on

06:24.885 --> 06:26.551
Some major dealers last night.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.954
- Let me guess who leaked this
amazing story,

06:28.956 --> 06:30.522
Your boy toy, ruzek?

06:30.524 --> 06:32.924
- [laughs]
- boy what? No.

06:32.926 --> 06:35.093
Just, if any--if any
back ups needed

06:35.095 --> 06:36.762
We're volunteering our services.

06:36.764 --> 06:39.765
- You didn't get upstairs,
burgess, so give it up.

06:39.767 --> 06:43.034
But, i do love your can-do
spirit, so

06:43.036 --> 06:46.738
I am assigning you two to
"psycho squad" duty.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.640
- Come on.
- The bulgarian consulate

06:48.642 --> 06:50.776
In chicago forwarded a list
of whackos who've made

06:50.778 --> 06:52.677
Threats against president
pla-no--

06:52.679 --> 06:55.714
Pla--pre--president pla--

06:55.716 --> 06:57.182
President whoever, who arrives
in two days

06:57.184 --> 06:59.518
For some trade conference.
You're gonna do spot checks

06:59.520 --> 07:02.187
On all persons on that list,
see if they pose a danger.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.990
- Yeah. Can't you put garcia
or sikora on this one?

07:04.992 --> 07:07.626
- Roman, be grateful i don't
park you at a desk

07:07.628 --> 07:09.094
Doing traffic reports.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.696
So i called around for an
available k-9 officer

07:11.698 --> 07:14.099
With a bomb sniffer mutt to
escort you two,

07:14.101 --> 07:17.169
She's on loan from the 31st so
show her a good time.

07:22.176 --> 07:23.475
- You gotta be kidding me.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.177
- What's wrong?

07:25.179 --> 07:26.211
- It's her.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.046
- Her who?

07:28.048 --> 07:30.549
- My ex-partner.

07:30.551 --> 07:31.583
- The one that you fell for?

07:31.585 --> 07:33.084
- Really?
I had no idea.

07:33.086 --> 07:38.023
- That's her?
Turn around.

07:38.025 --> 07:40.225
- This is your new partner?

07:40.227 --> 07:42.561
- Yeah.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.629
- Kim burgess.
Jen cassidy.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.932
- Hi, heard a lot about you.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.703
- My rig's outside.
I think i'll feed slayer.

07:51.705 --> 07:55.240
We roll in five.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.042
- Slayer?

07:57.044 --> 07:59.811
- I should've called in dead.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.481
- Trenton bostaph,
the club manager,

08:02.483 --> 08:04.249
No priors.
Not even a parking ticket.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.718
- So, aside from operating a
heroin lab,

08:06.720 --> 08:08.220
He's also a boy scout.
- Yeah.

08:08.222 --> 08:10.589
- That's 'cause trenton's
low level.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.657
He answers to this guy, blue.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.526
Which is an adorable nickname
i've put through

08:14.528 --> 08:16.061
The known offenders database.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.762
The most popular nickname
is "shorty."

08:17.764 --> 08:20.031
Second most popular nickname
is...

08:20.033 --> 08:21.132
Blue.
- Blue.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.234
- So it's gonna take
a little while

08:22.236 --> 08:23.502
To narrow it down.
- Okay.

08:23.504 --> 08:24.970
What do we got on the wire?

08:24.972 --> 08:26.972
- Hey. I couldn't fit these in
the locker.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.073
They're for meredith.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.508
- Oh, they're beautiful
- thanks.

08:29.510 --> 08:30.876
- I'll put them in some water.
- Oh, here.

08:30.878 --> 08:34.679
Pick up a card.
Something that says, uh...

08:34.681 --> 08:35.679
- Romantic.
- Yeah.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.716
- What's the occasion?

08:37.717 --> 08:40.885
- I'm moving out of the garage
into the house.

08:45.692 --> 08:50.629
- So, like i was saying.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.063
What do we got on the wire?

08:52.065 --> 08:54.032
- Trenton's been making a lot of
calls to this blue cat

08:54.034 --> 08:56.385
Trying to buy himself some time.

08:56.386 --> 08:58.737
- Those 20 kilos are almost
two million street value.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.071
Trenton's got two choices.

09:00.073 --> 09:02.007
He could hop a bus and disappear
or get dead.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.475
He knows it.

09:03.476 --> 09:04.942
I say we bring him in now,
flip him,

09:04.945 --> 09:06.177
Have him reel in blue.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.580
- Bring him in.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.684
- So, when'd you get in
the k-9 unit?

09:12.686 --> 09:14.586
I hear it's pretty rigorous.

09:14.588 --> 09:15.654
- Yeah, a few months ago.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.722
After a year of training.

09:17.724 --> 09:20.258
- You must really love dogs.

09:20.259 --> 09:22.793
- Yeah. Dogs actually listen
when you say something.

09:22.796 --> 09:23.995
- Good one, jen.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.630
- How's the 21st going?

09:25.632 --> 09:26.898
Hope you're controlling your
anger better

09:26.900 --> 09:28.700
Than you did back in 31.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.602
- I only get angry when
my girlfriend locks me out

09:30.604 --> 09:32.237
Of the apartment for two days
because some chick

09:32.239 --> 09:33.939
From high school facebooks me.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.974
Remember that, jen?
- Oh, that wasn't the only time.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.275
- Guys!
- When was the other time?

09:37.277 --> 09:38.693
- Listen, it's still early,

09:38.694 --> 09:40.110
Maybe you should conserve
your energy.

09:40.113 --> 09:43.048
Just...A little bit.

09:43.050 --> 09:47.352
- Drugs?
All i deal is fantasy.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.754
I'll give you guys coupons, you
can come check it out sometime.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.756
- Oh, yeah?
- Maybe get you up on stage.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.359
You'd win amateur night
hands down.

09:54.361 --> 09:57.929
- Would i?

09:57.931 --> 10:00.031
- Hey!

10:00.033 --> 10:02.901
- We heard you got robbed
last night.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.336
- I don't know what you're
talking about.

10:04.338 --> 10:06.938
I didn't report any robbery.

10:06.940 --> 10:12.344
- Think you're gonna find the
crew who ripped you off?

10:15.849 --> 10:17.716
Those 20 keys of passion.

10:17.718 --> 10:20.018
They're on ice in
our evidence locker.

10:20.020 --> 10:23.822
- Feel like talking now?

10:23.824 --> 10:26.725
- Man, i-i just manage
the joint upstairs,

10:26.727 --> 10:28.727
I-i make sure the stuff gets
cut downstairs

10:28.729 --> 10:31.296
And blue breaks me off a salary
for both.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.964
- Who's blue?
He running the show?

10:32.966 --> 10:35.133
- I don't know his real name.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.369
From what i know,
blue's their street captain.

10:37.371 --> 10:40.739
Muscle.
I got problems, i call him.

10:45.646 --> 10:47.012
- You're gonna set up a meet.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.947
Tell him you were robbed
by some outlaws.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.382
- Bikers?

10:50.384 --> 10:52.817
- Sounds like a great cover
story to me, he'll buy it.

10:52.819 --> 10:56.021
The outlaws are the only ones
crazy enough to rip you off.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.822
Besides us.

10:57.824 --> 11:00.892
- We cut you loose, nobody's
gonna believe your story anyway.

11:00.894 --> 11:03.294
You got robbed by a bunch
of cops?

11:03.296 --> 11:08.833
And then you owe some
very bad men two million.

11:08.835 --> 11:11.670
Make the call,
bring us blue,

11:11.672 --> 11:15.106
And we'll talk to the state's
attorney for you.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.957
- All right, we have
some company.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.698
- This is the outlaw's garage.

11:39.700 --> 11:43.034
I heard they were cutting it up.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.070
- There better be outlaws on
the other side of this door

11:45.072 --> 11:47.706
Holding a lot of h, or i'm
leaving you on the pavement.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.007
- Bad guys have heavy hardware.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.742
Everyone move in with caution.
- Geez.

11:50.744 --> 11:53.778
- Copy, coming around.

11:58.719 --> 12:00.251
- State pd! Drop the--
- drop the gun!

12:00.253 --> 12:02.721
- Get on the ground!
- Drop the weapon!

12:02.723 --> 12:06.758
[everyone yelling
over one another]

12:06.760 --> 12:08.993
- Put the gun on the ground.

12:08.995 --> 12:10.495
- Stay there. Stay down!

12:10.497 --> 12:12.997
Stay down!
- You gotta put it down!

12:12.999 --> 12:15.133
- Stay right where you are.
- Stay down.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.268
- Don't move.
- Get your hands behind your--

12:17.270 --> 12:19.404
- Let him go.

12:29.316 --> 12:34.018
- Okay. Okay.

12:34.020 --> 12:36.855
Okay, officers.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.758
Take me to jail.
- Get up.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.826
- Put your hands behind
your head.

12:41.828 --> 12:42.894
Don't move.

12:47.100 --> 12:47.332
.

12:47.334 --> 12:48.533
- So...

12:48.535 --> 12:54.305
Blue.
You got a real name?

12:54.307 --> 12:55.874
- Barack obama.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.542
- [laughs]

12:57.544 --> 13:00.378
- Ha, oh, i wasn't prepared
for this. It's an honor.

13:00.380 --> 13:03.381
Mr. President, we know that
you're part of a heroin ring.

13:03.383 --> 13:06.384
Runs out of angels strip club.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.453
- What heroin?

13:08.455 --> 13:11.456
- Come on, man.
We got you on a wire.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.359
Trenton was the front man,
he got ripped off.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.427
He was on the hook, and you had
orders to either get back

13:16.429 --> 13:19.564
The dope or you were gonna
kill him.

13:19.566 --> 13:23.835
What we wanna know is
who gives you the orders?

13:23.837 --> 13:27.105
- Or, that 20 kilos we ripped
from the club.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.106
What do you think, jay?

13:28.108 --> 13:29.407
We say we found it in his trunk?

13:29.409 --> 13:30.875
Send you up for 30 years.

13:30.877 --> 13:33.178
- Mm-hmm.

13:37.117 --> 13:40.885
- I'm not some corner boy that's
just gonna flip.

13:40.887 --> 13:44.489
What i am is hungry.

13:44.491 --> 13:47.091
So how about one of you go fetch
me a sandwich?

13:57.537 --> 13:59.604
- Get comfy.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.446
- Tell me.

14:08.448 --> 14:11.115
- He's not gonna flip.
- Hmm.

14:11.117 --> 14:12.951
- I'm gonna call the state's
attorney, get an i.D.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.220
And charge blue with
attempted homicide.

14:15.222 --> 14:17.288
- No.
Not yet.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.457
You charge him, word will get
out on the street.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.025
Just keep him chained
in the cage,

14:21.027 --> 14:22.327
Make sure his cell phone's
charged,

14:22.329 --> 14:24.596
We'll wire tap it,
see what we get.

14:24.598 --> 14:25.897
You got that?

14:25.899 --> 14:27.866
- I'll get a warrant.
- All right.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.934
[knock on door]

14:36.509 --> 14:39.377
- You seth morgan?

14:39.379 --> 14:41.212
- Uh--w--what did i do?

14:41.214 --> 14:43.414
[dog growls]

14:43.416 --> 14:44.883
- We were told you sent
a threatening letter

14:44.885 --> 14:46.517
To the bulgarian president.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.486
- The letter wasn't
threatening.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.322
I just needed to make sure that

14:51.324 --> 14:54.025
He knows svetlana is mine.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.426
- Svetlana?

14:55.428 --> 14:58.329
- I've sent her marriage
proposals.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.998
She hasn't responded.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.933
- Mm-hmm.

15:01.935 --> 15:04.402
- All clear.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.437
- Seth?
Seth!

15:06.439 --> 15:08.439
Hey, we have to ask.
Are you planning to harm

15:08.441 --> 15:10.208
The bulgarian president?

15:10.210 --> 15:11.976
- No.

15:11.978 --> 15:14.178
As long as he understands that

15:14.180 --> 15:16.648
Svetlana and i have
a special connection.

15:16.650 --> 15:18.549
- We'll make sure to pass
that message along.

15:18.551 --> 15:21.419
Just stay away
from the bulgarian consulate.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.455
- Uh, may i have your card?

15:24.457 --> 15:26.658
I case i ever need
your assistance.

15:26.660 --> 15:28.393
- Oh, sorry.
I'm fresh out.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.395
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, no, i'm good. I'm good.

15:30.397 --> 15:34.032
Thanks.
Have a good day.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.534
- You wanna tell me the full
story on this new c.I.?

15:36.536 --> 15:39.604
Elisha.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.372
- We met at an n.A. Meeting,

15:41.374 --> 15:42.941
Three months ago.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.275
Had dinner a few times.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.944
She was working the program.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.612
- Did she have a score to settle
with the manager?

15:47.614 --> 15:49.514
Trenton? At the club?

15:49.516 --> 15:51.215
- She never said anything to me,
so...

15:51.217 --> 15:53.518
- If it turns out there is a
beef between elisha and him,

15:53.520 --> 15:56.988
This whole case could be tossed

15:56.990 --> 15:59.590
For entrapment.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.993
- I called erin for help because
my friend was dying,

16:01.995 --> 16:06.130
I wasn't thinking about
an investigation.

16:06.132 --> 16:08.399
- Elisha was overdosing and
nadia brought her to

16:08.401 --> 16:10.401
My apartment.

16:10.403 --> 16:13.471
That's how i got the intel.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.409
- Give us a minute.

16:18.411 --> 16:21.479
- I'm sorry.

16:25.251 --> 16:27.518
- Were you gonna tell me?

16:27.520 --> 16:30.221
- I didn't want this to come
back on nadia.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.991
- Now it might come back on us.

16:32.993 --> 16:35.259
And what if this girl died
in your apartment?

16:35.261 --> 16:36.661
Internal affairs would've been
all over it,

16:36.663 --> 16:39.731
Especially because you're
tied to me.

16:42.035 --> 16:45.603
If your head is someplace else,
i need to know.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.739
- What does that mean?

16:47.741 --> 16:52.210
- This offer to join kot's
task force,

16:52.212 --> 16:57.015
Maybe it's got you distracted.

16:57.017 --> 17:00.084
- My head is where it
needs to be.

17:14.166 --> 17:17.068
- Hey.
Where we at on the wires?

17:17.069 --> 17:20.738
- Nothing. Radio silence.
Even the strip club is dead.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.540
Honestly, i think somebody
tipped them off.

17:22.541 --> 17:23.974
- There's no way we got made.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.409
Blue and trenton are
the only ones who know.

17:25.412 --> 17:26.810
They're on ice.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.347
So go back downstairs,
keep listening,

17:29.349 --> 17:31.549
And don't leave that chair.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.619
- What about the bathroom,
sarge?

17:39.726 --> 17:41.459
- [sighs]

17:51.171 --> 17:55.339
- Hello?

17:55.341 --> 17:57.108
Meredith?

17:57.110 --> 18:00.178
- I'm in here.

18:07.854 --> 18:10.121
- Where are you?

18:30.777 --> 18:32.844
- Alvin.

18:35.148 --> 18:39.417
- Toss the piece.

18:39.419 --> 18:44.255
Do it.

18:50.196 --> 18:53.898
- It's okay, baby.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.567
Just breathe.

18:56.569 --> 18:59.270
- We're gonna take a ride down
to your district house

18:59.272 --> 19:01.472
And get what's ours.

19:01.474 --> 19:04.275
- What are you talking about?

19:04.277 --> 19:07.411
- Why don't you refresh
his memory?

19:07.413 --> 19:11.382
- Alvin, they say you stole
their drugs.

19:11.384 --> 19:14.519
- 20 kilos of h.

19:14.521 --> 19:17.321
And you're gonna be a good
husband

19:17.323 --> 19:20.391
And go and get them back for us.

19:39.279 --> 19:39.477
.

19:39.479 --> 19:43.281
- My brother's got a fully-auto
to your wife's head.

19:43.283 --> 19:46.350
I got a text ready
to send to him.

19:46.352 --> 19:47.952
You walk in there and try to
warn anyone,

19:47.954 --> 19:51.189
I press send and she's dead.

19:51.191 --> 19:55.459
We understand each other?

19:55.461 --> 19:58.529
- We do.

20:17.217 --> 20:19.550
- Al, how's your night going?

20:19.552 --> 20:23.621
- Good. Just gotta grab
something for court tomorrow.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.991
[door buzzes to open]
thanks.

21:21.581 --> 21:26.517
- Open it.

21:44.337 --> 21:48.039
See? Just that easy.

21:48.041 --> 21:49.940
- Yeah.

21:49.942 --> 21:52.576
[shotgun blast]

22:28.047 --> 22:30.114
- Okay.

22:50.436 --> 22:52.503
[cell phone vibrates]

22:59.412 --> 23:03.013
- Looks like your man did what
he was told.

23:03.015 --> 23:05.416
We're not gonna be needing you
no more.

23:05.418 --> 23:07.685
- Drop it.

23:11.591 --> 23:15.726
- Where's my brother?

23:15.728 --> 23:17.928
- He's not coming.

23:17.930 --> 23:21.165
- I'll kill her.

23:21.167 --> 23:24.068
- Drop it.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.137
- Get on your knees.

23:36.649 --> 23:40.084
He doesn't have to walk out
of here.

23:47.026 --> 23:49.860
- Alvin!

24:00.907 --> 24:02.907
- [grunts]
- ah!

24:02.909 --> 24:06.977
[crying]

24:13.719 --> 24:16.587
[weeping]

24:17.990 --> 24:20.157
- I wonder how dumb you gotta
be to think you can get away

24:20.159 --> 24:22.126
With stealing 20 keys
of my dope.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.128
- Your dope? [scoffs]
that's a good--

24:25.531 --> 24:27.631
- Al, hey, you good, man?
- How's meredith?

24:27.633 --> 24:29.567
- She's shaken up pretty bad.

24:29.569 --> 24:30.901
How'd they get my address?

24:30.903 --> 24:32.353
Where i live?

24:32.354 --> 24:33.804
- It's like i told voight, man,
nobody's talking.

24:33.806 --> 24:34.972
- Well you're not gonna hear
a thing, because

24:34.974 --> 24:36.507
That wire's blown.
They got eyes on us.

24:36.509 --> 24:38.509
- You three.

24:38.511 --> 24:40.578
Take blue for a ride.

24:50.957 --> 24:53.491
- I wanna know who
tipped you off.

25:00.233 --> 25:05.202
- Yesterday i had seven kills
under my belt.

25:05.204 --> 25:07.271
Today, i got eight.

25:33.533 --> 25:36.667
Everyone...

25:36.669 --> 25:40.571
They had this look on their face
when it happened.

25:40.573 --> 25:42.106
I mean, it just lasted just a
split second,

25:42.108 --> 25:45.175
But i can see it.

25:47.246 --> 25:51.115
They were scared.

25:51.117 --> 25:54.985
Because, well...They knew.

25:54.987 --> 25:59.857
It was over.

25:59.859 --> 26:05.129
And as tough of a guy as you
think you are,

26:05.131 --> 26:09.833
I want you to know that
your brother...

26:09.835 --> 26:13.737
He had that look in his eyes
when i killed him.

26:17.677 --> 26:20.744
He was scared.

26:28.020 --> 26:30.154
- So, you guys, who knew there
were so many weirdos

26:30.156 --> 26:33.290
With grudges against bulgaria?

26:34.994 --> 26:38.362
- Sean ever tell you why he
disappeared from the 31st?

26:38.364 --> 26:39.964
- Disappeared, jen?

26:39.966 --> 26:41.732
It took three weeks for
my transfer to clear.

26:41.734 --> 26:43.133
You know that!
- [laughs] when you leave

26:43.135 --> 26:46.103
Without so much as a goodbye...
People talk.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.588
- I said goodbye--
- um, did you know that

26:47.589 --> 26:49.072
The capital of bulgaria is
sofia?

26:49.075 --> 26:50.674
That's kinda pretty, right?

26:50.676 --> 26:52.276
- Fascinating.

26:52.278 --> 26:54.812
I got some tele-marketer calls
to return.

26:54.814 --> 26:58.816
I'll see you out by the truck.
- Great.

27:01.754 --> 27:03.220
- He ever hit on you?

27:03.222 --> 27:05.389
- T--sean? No...No way.

27:05.391 --> 27:07.891
He's been a gentleman.

27:07.893 --> 27:10.894
And i'm involved with someone
anyways.

27:10.896 --> 27:12.730
- He ever tell you
the real story,

27:12.732 --> 27:14.064
Why he transferred out?
- Listen,

27:14.066 --> 27:15.399
It's really none of my business,
so you--

27:15.401 --> 27:17.935
- Even though we were partners,

27:17.937 --> 27:19.303
I knew better.

27:19.305 --> 27:23.407
Me and sean had a fling.

27:23.409 --> 27:28.145
It was, uh--it was hot.

27:28.147 --> 27:31.915
It was crazy, it was fun.

27:31.917 --> 27:35.085
But i moved on to bigger
and better things.

27:35.087 --> 27:38.422
- Hm.
- Yeah.

27:38.424 --> 27:41.725
Sean ever talk about me?

27:41.727 --> 27:44.695
I mean, like, not that i care.

27:44.697 --> 27:48.065
God.

27:48.067 --> 27:50.134
- A little.

27:58.277 --> 28:00.077
- How you holding up?

28:00.079 --> 28:02.046
- I'm okay.

28:02.048 --> 28:03.881
I want to thank you.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.983
- You don't need to thank me.
Thank nadia.

28:05.985 --> 28:08.318
She saved you.

28:08.320 --> 28:11.989
Listen, we really appreciate you
helping us take down that club.

28:11.991 --> 28:14.391
So...You stay clean.

28:14.393 --> 28:17.695
I'll see what i can do to help.

28:20.433 --> 28:22.966
- I'll be back.

28:22.968 --> 28:25.269
Hey, erin.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.842
Voight's still really pissed
at me.

28:31.844 --> 28:34.144
Should i be looking for
a new job?

28:34.146 --> 28:36.180
- Honey, i know you think you
were just doing your best

28:36.182 --> 28:38.248
With elisha.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.317
If you wanna be a cop,

28:40.319 --> 28:41.752
You gotta start thinking
like one.

28:41.754 --> 28:44.822
You gotta make smarter choices.

28:44.824 --> 28:46.957
- I know.

28:46.959 --> 28:51.028
- Get her to a meeting.
I'll talk to voight.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.267
- He give us anything?

28:57.269 --> 29:01.038
- No.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.140
[coughs]

29:03.142 --> 29:05.209
- Hey, man, um...

29:05.211 --> 29:07.344
I used to be on patrol with
this guy,

29:07.346 --> 29:11.014
Big dude. Sparred with him all
the time.

29:11.016 --> 29:14.384
And then, he was involved
in two fatals.

29:14.386 --> 29:16.153
In two months.

29:16.155 --> 29:18.956
And he stopped going to the gym,

29:18.958 --> 29:21.525
Shriveled up--

29:21.527 --> 29:23.360
- What are you saying?

29:23.362 --> 29:24.995
- I don't know if--if you ever
want to get anything

29:24.997 --> 29:26.997
Off your chest, you know?

29:26.999 --> 29:29.133
I'm here.

29:29.135 --> 29:30.467
- I'll live.
- [laughs]

29:30.469 --> 29:31.969
- But i appreciate you asking.

29:31.971 --> 29:32.970
- Okay,

29:32.972 --> 29:35.305
These guys got protection.

29:35.307 --> 29:37.307
The question is, how high up?

29:37.309 --> 29:39.076
- I think i got a pretty good
idea.

29:39.078 --> 29:40.410
Prints came back on our
offenders,

29:40.412 --> 29:42.546
Blue's real name is
carl johnson.

29:42.548 --> 29:44.181
Guys that showed up at al's
house,

29:44.183 --> 29:45.816
They're actually brothers.

29:45.818 --> 29:49.052
A.K.A. The gary brothers.
Jamal and jesse seeley,

29:49.054 --> 29:51.421
Originally from gary, indiana,
known psychopaths,

29:51.423 --> 29:52.790
All three of these guys.

29:52.792 --> 29:53.991
Rap sheets a mile long.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.459
Manslaughter, assault,

29:55.461 --> 29:57.394
Possession of narcotics with
intent to distribute,

29:57.396 --> 29:59.229
They should've been put away
a long time ago.

29:59.231 --> 30:00.364
- Who defended them?

30:00.366 --> 30:01.365
- Now that's just it.

30:01.367 --> 30:03.300
They all had public defenders.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.035
One thing that they have
in common

30:05.037 --> 30:07.838
Is a judge.
Judge darren lachlan,

30:07.840 --> 30:09.907
He presided over all
their cases.

30:09.909 --> 30:12.142
- Lachlan?
- Hmm.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.311
- He was named in an fbi sting
a few years back.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.046
Taking bribes to fix cases.

30:16.048 --> 30:18.015
Two judges went down,
but he escaped.

30:18.017 --> 30:19.683
- All right, taking bribes is
one thing

30:19.684 --> 30:21.350
But are we saying we think a
judge is the silent partner

30:21.353 --> 30:22.920
In a heroin ring?

30:22.921 --> 30:24.488
- I mean, i know it sounds like
a conspiracy theory

30:24.490 --> 30:26.957
So i called to the state's
attorney's office...

30:26.959 --> 30:30.027
Guess who requested to review
our wire tap just yesterday?

30:30.029 --> 30:32.930
- You know, my name was on that
paperwork for that seizure.

30:32.932 --> 30:35.132
So he'd have access to that
and my home address.

30:35.134 --> 30:37.835
- Now, hold on,
if we're going after a judge,

30:37.837 --> 30:40.137
I'm gonna need a hell of a lot
more than speculation.

30:40.139 --> 30:41.905
- I looked into his financials.

30:41.907 --> 30:44.041
Actually, i didn't...Uh,
graffiti artist i busted

30:44.043 --> 30:45.542
Works at kinko's, total hacker.

30:45.544 --> 30:48.946
He did. And it looks like
our judge has a, uh,

30:48.948 --> 30:51.114
Stash house, boss.

30:55.087 --> 30:56.854
It's a two million dollar
brownstone.

30:56.856 --> 30:59.356
Purchased through a
shell company owned by lachlan.

30:59.358 --> 31:02.426
Pretty sure his wife
doesn't know about it.

31:13.906 --> 31:16.974
[man and woman
laughing upstairs]

31:21.080 --> 31:22.613
[screams]

31:22.615 --> 31:25.883
- What are you doing?

31:30.656 --> 31:31.088
.

31:31.090 --> 31:34.658
- I don't gotta tell you how
interrogations work.

31:34.660 --> 31:37.361
Got your muscle.

31:37.363 --> 31:40.998
Your suppliers.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.934
They get probation instead
of prison time.

31:43.936 --> 31:47.638
In return,
kick profits back to you.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.606
That's how you bought
your little love nest.

31:49.608 --> 31:53.176
- Did my broker make some smart
investments? Yes.

31:53.178 --> 31:54.912
Am i protecting a narcotics
empire?

31:54.914 --> 31:56.680
You're out of
your freaking mind.

31:56.682 --> 32:00.450
- Why'd you put in a request to
check our wire?

32:00.452 --> 32:05.188
- All signs point to you
selling us out.

32:05.190 --> 32:07.624
- Both of you, outside.

32:15.668 --> 32:18.101
I just got off the phone with
the superintendant.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.536
You realize the mess
you're making?

32:19.538 --> 32:21.705
- Judge lachlan is
our main suspect.

32:21.707 --> 32:24.041
- Judge? Suspect?

32:24.043 --> 32:26.610
Only the feds use those two
words in the same sentence.

32:26.612 --> 32:29.079
- If you buy us some time,
we will hang him.

32:29.081 --> 32:30.247
- Not only are you out of time,

32:30.249 --> 32:31.581
But you're out of
an investigation.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.984
I want judge lachlan released
immediately.

32:33.986 --> 32:35.686
- Uh, excuse me, commander.

32:35.688 --> 32:36.899
I've been running the call
histories

32:36.900 --> 32:38.111
On the gary brothers'
cell phones.

32:38.112 --> 32:39.323
One of them had a call to
a hard line

32:39.325 --> 32:41.525
At the superior court on
26th and cal yesterday.

32:41.527 --> 32:42.960
- Were they calling judge
lachlan?

32:42.962 --> 32:43.961
- No, sir.

32:43.963 --> 32:47.030
The branch clerk,
evan lormer.

32:49.501 --> 32:52.336
- We roll in five.

32:52.338 --> 32:55.038
- Hey. There's some guy outside
asking for you.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.506
- Did he say what he wants?
- No.

32:56.508 --> 32:58.408
But he's got d.E.A. Written
all over him.

32:58.410 --> 33:00.644
Either that,
or he's the marlboro man.

33:13.625 --> 33:16.526
- Special agent david lang.

33:16.528 --> 33:19.229
- You obviously already know
who i am.

33:19.231 --> 33:21.131
- Heard you guys had a big win
today.

33:21.133 --> 33:24.668
- Yeah, we're still working it.
So can we make this quick?

33:24.670 --> 33:26.436
- I would've made a proper house
call earlier,

33:26.438 --> 33:28.505
But i'm not sure your sergeant
would be happy

33:28.507 --> 33:31.174
If i were in his office poaching
his best detective.

33:31.176 --> 33:33.076
- State's attorney kot tell you
to say that?

33:33.078 --> 33:36.146
- Kot doesn't know i'm here.

33:41.086 --> 33:44.755
I respect what intelligence does
for this city.

33:44.757 --> 33:47.624
But if you join the task force,
you won't be taking dope

33:47.626 --> 33:49.526
Off the street.

33:49.528 --> 33:52.562
I'm talking about shutting down
cross-border drug networks,

33:52.564 --> 33:55.499
And that's making a difference
across the country.

33:55.501 --> 33:58.402
Not just in a few neighborhoods.

34:07.346 --> 34:10.414
Don't make a decision
you'll regret.

34:19.291 --> 34:22.125
- Here we go.

34:22.127 --> 34:26.129
- Hey.

34:26.130 --> 34:27.697
Y--you can't just barge in here.

34:27.699 --> 34:29.132
- Evan lormer.

34:29.134 --> 34:30.667
- Mr. Lormer just left.

34:30.668 --> 34:32.235
Said he felt sick,
was going home early.

34:32.237 --> 34:33.804
- Where is he parked?

35:02.634 --> 35:03.600
- Show me your hands!

35:03.602 --> 35:04.701
Show me your hands!

35:04.703 --> 35:06.203
Do it!

35:06.204 --> 35:07.704
Keep your hands where i can see
them, you understand?

35:07.706 --> 35:09.606
Turn your head to the right.

35:17.749 --> 35:19.249
- Hey.

35:19.251 --> 35:22.219
Check this out.

35:22.221 --> 35:25.355
- Huh. Looks like we found
our kingpin.

35:33.832 --> 35:34.264
.

35:34.266 --> 35:36.733
- Blue.
The gary brothers.

35:36.735 --> 35:39.536
Judge lachlan sends them to
prison but you forged

35:39.538 --> 35:41.605
The order of incarceration
papers and gave them

35:41.607 --> 35:43.173
Probation instead.

35:43.175 --> 35:44.741
- That's how you were able to
get the paperwork

35:44.743 --> 35:48.145
On our wire tap.

35:48.147 --> 35:51.815
- You see what we're up against
in this city everyday,

35:51.817 --> 35:54.551
And you see the victims
firsthand in court.

35:54.553 --> 35:56.887
So tell me how a lifelong civil
servant decides

35:56.889 --> 35:58.488
To work for the other team,

35:58.490 --> 36:01.391
And gets into the heroin game.

36:01.393 --> 36:04.161
- You know what else i see
firsthand?

36:04.163 --> 36:06.296
Corruption.

36:06.298 --> 36:09.332
For years, i've seen officials
on the take.

36:09.334 --> 36:12.802
The gary brothers,
they came to me.

36:12.804 --> 36:14.371
Made an offer.

36:14.373 --> 36:16.606
I keep them and blue
out of prison,

36:16.608 --> 36:18.875
They give me a cut.

36:18.877 --> 36:22.612
So i forged court documents
for the three of them.

36:22.614 --> 36:25.615
- The felons you let off.

36:25.617 --> 36:30.387
Their dope killed kids.

36:30.389 --> 36:33.456
- If it wasn't me, it would've
been someone else.

36:35.727 --> 36:36.726
- Hey.

36:36.728 --> 36:38.578
One last name came in from

36:38.579 --> 36:40.429
The consulate, sounds like
a real winner.

36:40.432 --> 36:42.365
Some guy upset at bulgaria
'cause they're trying to

36:42.367 --> 36:43.817
Join the e.U.

36:43.818 --> 36:45.268
- Maybe after this we can get
back to real police work?

36:45.270 --> 36:47.737
- Hey, how's that k-9 girl
working out for ya?

36:47.739 --> 36:50.507
- If i have to do another day
with her, i'm gonna transfer.

36:50.509 --> 36:51.541
To milwaukee.

36:51.543 --> 36:52.976
- Oh, don't kid yourself, roman.

36:52.978 --> 36:56.246
You're so in love with that girl
it ain't even funny.

36:58.283 --> 37:00.350
What?

37:01.553 --> 37:06.556
- Hey.

37:06.558 --> 37:07.557
How's it going?
- Hey.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.426
Riding with roman and his ex.

37:09.428 --> 37:11.561
I don't know, driving me crazy.
- Oh, ouch.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.530
Well, on a bright note,
i've missed you.

37:13.532 --> 37:14.664
- Do you think--wait.

37:14.666 --> 37:16.266
Do you think that could happen
to us?

37:16.268 --> 37:17.267
- What?

37:17.269 --> 37:18.268
- Like if we broke up

37:18.270 --> 37:19.936
In--in secret--
- wait a sec.

37:19.938 --> 37:20.937
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:20.939 --> 37:22.739
- Hey, greg.
- How you doing?

37:22.741 --> 37:25.508
- In secret, i mean. And then we
had to see each other everyday.

37:25.510 --> 37:26.743
Would we hate each other?

37:26.745 --> 37:28.345
- Burgess.

37:28.347 --> 37:29.880
- Now that i think about it,
i would transfer too--

37:29.881 --> 37:31.414
- Hey, we're not breaking up...
- No, platt might come--

37:31.416 --> 37:35.318
All right? Don't even--

37:35.320 --> 37:36.253
- Sorry.

37:36.255 --> 37:40.257
- It's all right.

37:40.259 --> 37:41.575
All right, i just clocked out.

37:41.576 --> 37:42.892
I'm thinking you, me,
beers at molly's,

37:42.894 --> 37:46.329
Then back to my place for
a romantic microwave dinner.

37:46.331 --> 37:48.298
- [laughs]

37:48.300 --> 37:50.000
All right, i'm almost off,
i'll meet you there.

37:50.002 --> 37:51.001
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

37:51.003 --> 37:53.270
I wouldn't miss it.

37:56.441 --> 37:58.508
Just go.

38:00.445 --> 38:03.313
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:06.385 --> 38:10.020
- About nadia. If you're gonna
be mad, be mad at me.

38:10.022 --> 38:11.855
I should've been straight
with you.

38:11.857 --> 38:13.690
- As long as she understands,
i give her a chance,

38:13.692 --> 38:15.725
She only gets one.

38:15.727 --> 38:17.060
- She does. Believe me.

38:17.062 --> 38:20.797
- Yeah, i know.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.365
- And, uh...

38:22.367 --> 38:25.368
As far as chances,

38:25.370 --> 38:27.304
You're right.

38:27.306 --> 38:30.307
I've been thinking about
this task force.

38:30.309 --> 38:33.476
A lot.

38:33.478 --> 38:35.478
- And?

38:35.480 --> 38:40.450
- And i've been cleaning up
after people my whole life.

38:40.452 --> 38:43.420
This feels like my chance to get
out in front of it.

38:53.365 --> 38:55.932
- Wow. 15 years.

38:59.604 --> 39:04.974
15 years ago you were a girl
barely surviving on the street.

39:04.976 --> 39:07.110
Now you're being courted by
the feds.

39:07.112 --> 39:10.714
- [chuckles]

39:10.716 --> 39:14.718
- I'm proud of you, erin.

39:14.720 --> 39:19.022
And whatever decision
you wanna make,

39:19.024 --> 39:22.092
I'll back you.

39:54.459 --> 39:56.760
- All right.
Molly's, you in?

39:56.762 --> 40:00.430
- Um, actually i need to tell
you guys something.

40:03.435 --> 40:06.136
A lot of you know that i--
i've had an offer to

40:06.138 --> 40:10.573
Take a spot on
a federal task force.

40:10.575 --> 40:15.545
And i've thought long and hard
about this.

40:18.483 --> 40:21.418
And i've decided to take it.

40:46.945 --> 40:48.478
- You got plans tonight,
burgess?

40:48.480 --> 40:51.581
- Uh, molly's. Yeah, i think
everyone will be there.

40:51.583 --> 40:52.849
- What about you, jen?

40:52.851 --> 40:54.184
You gonna take a long,
moonlight cruise

40:54.186 --> 40:56.553
Around the lake
with peter the boat cop?

40:56.555 --> 40:58.021
- Roman.
- Peter's no longer with

40:58.023 --> 40:59.756
The marine unit.

40:59.757 --> 41:01.490
He has ambition.
He just made sergeant.

41:01.493 --> 41:02.859
- You know what you're gonna do
after this, jen?

41:02.861 --> 41:04.761
You're gonna pack up that little
doggie of yours,

41:04.763 --> 41:06.196
And you're gonna go back to
your own district.

41:06.198 --> 41:08.164
- Guys, can't we just--
- you show up smashed

41:08.166 --> 41:10.133
And uninvited to
my engagement party

41:10.135 --> 41:12.068
And start taking swings at
my fiancee

41:12.070 --> 41:13.169
And you end up knocking out
his father.

41:13.171 --> 41:14.637
- I apologized.

41:14.639 --> 41:16.606
- You know what?
Stewie.

41:16.608 --> 41:18.141
You stuffed an "i'm sorry" card
in my locker

41:18.143 --> 41:20.844
But you never apologized
to peter or his father.

41:20.846 --> 41:22.178
- He swung at me first.

41:22.180 --> 41:23.613
- He's 60 years old!
- I had to protect myself.

41:23.615 --> 41:24.881
- Okay, this is what we are
gonna do!

41:24.882 --> 41:26.148
We are gonna go check
this last house

41:26.151 --> 41:27.984
And then we're gonna go home.
- Fine.

41:27.986 --> 41:30.119
- You wanna know about
your new partner, burgess?

41:30.121 --> 41:31.788
After we broke up,
he couldn't take it

41:31.790 --> 41:35.225
So he goes on a jealous rampage
and he transfers out.

41:35.227 --> 41:37.594
- How did we break up and just
two weeks later, you're engaged?

41:37.596 --> 41:40.096
Unless you're looking to climb
the ladder, jen.

41:40.098 --> 41:41.264
- You know what? Don't even
go there--

41:41.266 --> 41:42.499
- Can you two just shut up?

41:42.501 --> 41:43.766
Just shut up!

41:43.768 --> 41:45.201
- I put just as much of myself
into this job--

41:45.203 --> 41:48.638
[rings doorbell]
[gunshot]

41:48.640 --> 41:50.073
- Burgess!
- 10-1, officer down!

41:50.075 --> 41:52.108
3316 west 21st street.

41:52.110 --> 41:57.580
- Okay. Move her.
Here!

41:57.582 --> 42:00.149
Put pressure on this.

42:00.151 --> 42:01.951
10-1, 10-1. Shots fired
at police

42:01.953 --> 42:04.087
At 3316 west 21st street,

42:04.089 --> 42:05.288
My partner's been shot.
