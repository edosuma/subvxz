00:12.833 --> 00:13.666
Charlotte?

00:16.916 --> 00:17.791
Charlotte?

00:28.541 --> 00:30.333
-No, guys, focus!
-Yeah, but…

00:30.416 --> 00:32.416
-Come on.
-Give us the cue again?

00:32.500 --> 00:34.291
And action.

00:34.375 --> 00:36.708
Hi, we're here today
with Jean-Marie Bougin,

00:36.791 --> 00:40.375
a great local farmer
interested in our compost plan.

00:40.458 --> 00:41.708
-Charlotte?
-Good morning…

00:41.791 --> 00:44.458
No, scram. Beat it. Scram. Beat it. Yeah?

00:47.541 --> 00:50.041
Wasn't it enough to steal my ex
and spit on our pact?

00:51.125 --> 00:53.208
So we're not sisters anymore?

00:53.291 --> 00:54.833
Are you trying to steal my life?

00:56.375 --> 00:57.625
Max, I can see you.

00:59.916 --> 01:01.708
Don't you understand it hurts me?

01:01.791 --> 01:05.875
If you wanted exclusivity on this idea,
you should have got off your ass.

01:06.708 --> 01:08.166
-Got off my ass?
-Yeah.

01:08.875 --> 01:11.000
It's all I've been doing for six months.

01:11.083 --> 01:11.916
-Really?
-Yes.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.208
I haven't seen you try it
with the local farmers.

01:15.500 --> 01:16.666
Local farmers?

01:17.958 --> 01:20.000
I want to do it with Julio.

01:20.083 --> 01:21.750
What has this got to do with him?

01:23.291 --> 01:25.166
It has to do with love.

01:27.166 --> 01:29.916
There's actually a living being at stake.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.166
Hey, we're paying him.

01:32.250 --> 01:33.541
Well, I'm paying him.

01:33.625 --> 01:35.416
And he's perfectly consenting.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.208
-"Consenting"?
-Of course!

01:37.291 --> 01:39.000
An embryo? Consenting?

01:39.750 --> 01:42.250
Don't worry, Elsa, I'm totally consenting.

01:42.333 --> 01:43.625
-You see?
-Girls?

01:44.500 --> 01:45.333
Girls?

01:45.416 --> 01:46.375
I'm totally lost.

01:46.458 --> 01:47.291
-Okay.
-Is--

01:47.375 --> 01:51.083
You told Milou about this compost idea.
She told me, and I stole it.

01:51.166 --> 01:52.833
-What?
-What are you talking about?

01:52.916 --> 01:55.625
No, I'm talking about this.

01:55.708 --> 01:56.833
-What?
-Yeah.

01:56.916 --> 01:57.791
You're pregnant?

01:57.875 --> 01:59.916
-But…
-Can't you stop annoying everyone?

02:00.000 --> 02:02.333
-You're the one who's pregnant!
-Are you crazy?

02:02.416 --> 02:04.375
I'm not pregnant. What a nightmare.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.708
No! Hey! Shut up!

02:06.791 --> 02:08.625
I'm the one who's pregnant!

02:10.958 --> 02:14.041
I tried to tell you,
but you were too focused on yourselves.

02:14.125 --> 02:16.208
-Okay, what's your problem?
-But…

02:16.833 --> 02:19.750
-I thought you'd rather chop your arm off?
-It wasn't planned.

02:22.541 --> 02:24.791
I don't even want to share this with you.

02:25.583 --> 02:26.541
Fine.

02:26.625 --> 02:28.083
So it's my fault again?

02:28.166 --> 02:30.375
You've both been
demonizing me for 15 years.

02:30.458 --> 02:33.416
You've been treating me
like a child for 15 years.

02:33.500 --> 02:34.708
And I'm not your mother.

02:35.833 --> 02:36.791
Okay?

02:36.875 --> 02:38.583
I've got enough on my plate.

02:39.500 --> 02:40.875
Here's your test.

02:41.583 --> 02:42.541
Congratulations.

02:45.416 --> 02:47.041
A NETFLIX SERIES

02:48.250 --> 02:49.500
THE LAME PLAN

02:49.583 --> 02:51.291
THE CRAZY PLAN

02:51.375 --> 02:53.833
THE BOOTY PLAN

02:53.916 --> 02:55.833
THE HOOK-UP PLAN

02:56.500 --> 02:58.291
Well, thank you. See you soon.

02:58.375 --> 02:59.750
My pleasure. Get home safe.

03:01.625 --> 03:02.541
Here.

03:04.916 --> 03:06.041
Hello.

03:06.125 --> 03:07.000
Hello.

03:07.083 --> 03:08.375
Wait, Maxime.

03:08.458 --> 03:10.875
Can we share a cab?
Given that we work together.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.333
It's better if we're not seen together.

03:13.416 --> 03:14.458
Right. The plan.

03:14.541 --> 03:15.500
Elsa! Julio!

03:16.000 --> 03:16.833
Max!

03:17.500 --> 03:19.958
I need to talk to you about something.

03:20.041 --> 03:22.208
-I'm not going to punch you.
-I'm not scared.

03:22.291 --> 03:24.875
No, alpha males are never scared, right?

03:26.416 --> 03:31.083
I could tell you that you fucked up,
that you can't do these things…

03:31.916 --> 03:33.791
But honestly,

03:33.875 --> 03:35.166
sometimes people fuck up.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.458
I wanted to talk to you
about what you've become.

03:39.833 --> 03:41.291
An asshole, and proud of it.

03:43.541 --> 03:44.791
I don't like this guy.

03:46.416 --> 03:48.083
-Nobody here does.
-Nobody.

03:52.875 --> 03:54.500
There. You can leave now.

03:59.416 --> 04:01.333
-That felt fucking good.
-I'll bet.

04:02.666 --> 04:04.125
You sleeping in the house?

04:04.208 --> 04:07.333
No, I'm staying in my little shed.
I've been improving it.

04:08.416 --> 04:11.500
Besides, given Emilie's mood,
I'd be better off outside.

04:12.000 --> 04:12.916
See you.

04:17.208 --> 04:18.791
Okay, they're gone.

04:18.875 --> 04:19.875
Yeah, I saw.

04:23.708 --> 04:25.041
Come on. Don't worry.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.041
It'll all work out.

04:27.125 --> 04:30.500
I don't give a damn. It's fine.
I'm too old for this bullshit.

04:34.958 --> 04:36.833
You pulled out every time, right?

04:37.416 --> 04:39.708
I mean, that one time…

04:40.583 --> 04:41.416
Yes.

04:42.541 --> 04:44.708
But it's pretty good news.

04:44.791 --> 04:46.166
Yes, it's good news.

04:46.250 --> 04:47.750
It's cool.

04:47.833 --> 04:49.458
Yeah. It's cool.

04:49.541 --> 04:50.458
It's…

04:51.208 --> 04:52.666
It's…

04:53.375 --> 04:55.916
-It's a beautiful thing.
-Beautiful, yeah.

04:56.750 --> 04:57.708
Yeah.

05:02.666 --> 05:04.000
Here we are.

05:04.083 --> 05:05.500
This is all for you.

05:07.958 --> 05:09.791
But, Mom, this is

05:11.083 --> 05:12.958
your workshop, not my room anymore.

05:13.041 --> 05:15.916
Yes, but I kept your little bed up there.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.708
You'll be snug in there.
Maybe it'll inspire you.

05:18.791 --> 05:19.791
We don't need that.

05:19.875 --> 05:23.625
"We don't need that." Come on.
You can't catch flies with vinegar.

05:23.708 --> 05:25.583
Look at this, Jules.

05:25.666 --> 05:26.708
Who is this?

05:26.791 --> 05:29.291
Elsa, during her "fat" period.
My little dumpling.

05:29.375 --> 05:31.208
Elsa inspired all of this.

05:31.291 --> 05:33.833
They're the only ones
I never managed to sell.

05:33.916 --> 05:37.208
If you don't like the room,
there's your sister's, the prettiest.

05:37.291 --> 05:39.791
-But…
-I'm talking about the room.

05:39.875 --> 05:41.166
Okay.

05:41.250 --> 05:43.125
No, take a breath. Relax.

05:43.208 --> 05:46.291
Thank you very much.
We'll get settled in. It's kind of you.

05:47.875 --> 05:49.625
Go ahead. Okay.

05:50.500 --> 05:51.750
-Look at me.
-Yes.

05:51.833 --> 05:53.583
-We'll find a solution.
-Okay.

05:53.666 --> 05:55.291
We're not staying long.

05:55.375 --> 05:56.708
-No.
-Okay?

05:56.791 --> 05:58.750
PAUILLAC THROWS COMPOST IN THE GAME

05:58.833 --> 06:00.916
It's crazy how I don't miss the girls.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.541
"With his compost plan,

06:02.625 --> 06:06.125
which has the support of a farmer in Oise
and relayed by social media,

06:06.208 --> 06:08.166
Maxime Pauillac has gained

06:08.250 --> 06:11.291
nine points in the polls
over the past week!"

06:11.375 --> 06:13.125
Wow! I'm proud of you, baby!

06:21.041 --> 06:23.583
Even though
our program is a lot of hot air…

06:23.666 --> 06:27.916
No! It's hot air
so we can sail off to victory, baby.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Yes!

06:29.083 --> 06:33.500
And more great news. I've had
an "offer we can't refuse" for Pinkars.

06:33.583 --> 06:34.500
Fruse?

06:34.583 --> 06:37.500
A friend of mine
hooked me up with an investment bank.

06:37.583 --> 06:38.708
If you sell,

06:38.791 --> 06:41.041
you cash the biggest check you've ever--

06:41.125 --> 06:43.208
That's annoying.
You need to get them higher.

06:43.291 --> 06:44.916
You cash your big check.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.708
You get more cash
to invest in my… in our campaign.

06:47.791 --> 06:51.000
I rise. You rise.

06:52.333 --> 06:53.750
You remember we're a team?

06:53.833 --> 06:56.583
-Yeah.
-So I'm mayor of the 9th, and you…

06:57.375 --> 06:59.166
Yeah. I rise, you rise, we rise…

06:59.250 --> 07:01.583
I do need to find myself a new project.

07:01.666 --> 07:02.625
Are you kidding?

07:02.708 --> 07:05.208
Taking care of me
should be enough for you.

07:05.291 --> 07:08.250
You're the 9th district mayor's wife.

07:08.333 --> 07:09.166
Yeah.

07:09.750 --> 07:12.958
And we'll be able to afford
those friends we've dreamed about.

07:13.041 --> 07:13.875
Yeah!

07:15.000 --> 07:16.291
-You're right.
-Yeah.

07:16.375 --> 07:18.833
-Push them higher though.
-Yeah?

07:18.916 --> 07:20.041
-Like this?
-No.

07:20.125 --> 07:21.625
-Isn't it too much?
-The balloons.

07:21.708 --> 07:22.875
-Of course.
-Yes.

07:22.958 --> 07:24.041
Yeah, right away.

07:25.000 --> 07:25.875
PARIS CASINO

07:25.958 --> 07:29.875
I know you're expecting a hit song,
and that's exactly what I'm looking for.

07:29.958 --> 07:31.333
I think I'm pretty close--

07:31.416 --> 07:33.208
You got something I can listen to?

07:34.041 --> 07:34.875
Well…

07:34.958 --> 07:36.958
You know I signed Paul Dayno?

07:37.041 --> 07:38.500
-You know who he is?
-Yes.

07:38.583 --> 07:41.000
That guy is a fucking purist.

07:41.541 --> 07:43.833
I need to take pictures
of the venue. Coming?

07:43.916 --> 07:44.750
Yeah.

07:44.833 --> 07:47.708
See, I'm a fucking purist too.

07:47.791 --> 07:51.000
That's why, like Paul Dayno,
I'm searching for more authenticity.

07:51.083 --> 07:52.041
That's nice.

07:52.125 --> 07:54.083
-And also sincerity.
-I love it.

07:54.583 --> 07:56.000
Really, I love it.

07:56.083 --> 07:57.666
People are going to love it.

07:57.750 --> 08:00.250
Except, people don't
give a crap, you know?

08:00.333 --> 08:01.666
I have nothing against you.

08:01.750 --> 08:04.750
The "music is art" thing is great,
but it's foremost an industry.

08:04.833 --> 08:06.583
Yes, an industry, I know.

08:06.666 --> 08:08.625
So what's the problem? Inspiration?

08:08.708 --> 08:11.291
You need some help? You need money, maybe?

08:12.833 --> 08:16.916
No, but now that you mention it,
an advance could help.

08:17.000 --> 08:17.833
Okay.

08:18.375 --> 08:21.375
There's a major agency
looking for music for a commercial.

08:21.458 --> 08:23.333
It's goat cheese, but it's well made.

08:23.833 --> 08:25.916
They want the rights to "So Close to Me."

08:26.000 --> 08:28.083
-Are we a go?
-I'm not touching that song.

08:28.833 --> 08:31.000
You need to help me out just a little.

08:33.625 --> 08:37.458
All artists, at some point,
stopped being afraid of making money.

08:39.333 --> 08:40.750
Paul will love this place.

08:41.625 --> 08:43.791
So think about the ad, and call me?

08:48.333 --> 08:49.458
Flip, flop, and gone.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.416
-What's gone?
-Flip-flops that dissolve in water.

08:53.958 --> 08:54.916
No, that sucks.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.083
-It's awesome!
-What if it rains?

08:58.125 --> 08:59.791
-Yeah, you're right.
-Yeah.

08:59.875 --> 09:01.333
-That doesn't work.
-No.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.916
Did the girls from
the community canteen call back?

09:04.000 --> 09:07.708
No, crowdfunding.
They got three times what I was offering.

09:07.791 --> 09:11.791
Okay, listen, don't panic.
When is your Suzanne getting here?

09:11.875 --> 09:15.125
Wow! Roman Pavic's <i>One Old Woman Show.</i>

09:15.208 --> 09:16.250
I love it!

09:16.333 --> 09:17.791
It's killer. It's awesome.

09:17.875 --> 09:20.291
But not for kids.
Kids are kind of annoying.

09:20.375 --> 09:21.625
Hi, Suzanne.

09:21.708 --> 09:25.416
We love it too, but we can't keep it
because Roman isn't a woman.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.791
-Fuck women, right?
-Well, no…

09:28.333 --> 09:29.208
-Elsa?
-Yeah.

09:29.291 --> 09:31.041
Why do you leave your hair like that?

09:31.125 --> 09:33.666
-What?
-It's not great. You should…

09:33.750 --> 09:35.875
-Bump that up a little. There!
-Okay.

09:36.541 --> 09:38.375
See? Reinvent yourself a little.

09:38.458 --> 09:40.250
We've already been through hell…

09:40.333 --> 09:43.375
-Okay.
-…these last two years with that virus.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Done.

09:45.583 --> 09:49.125
There! We can at least help
Roman the cross-dresser,

09:49.208 --> 09:50.250
and that's modern.

09:50.333 --> 09:53.791
He isn't a drag queen, or trans.
He wears a costume.

09:53.875 --> 09:54.791
Wow.

09:55.750 --> 09:58.333
Whose naughty eyes are these?

09:58.416 --> 09:59.500
-Hello.
-Hello.

10:00.083 --> 10:01.250
I'm a volunteer.

10:02.166 --> 10:05.291
In fact, I'm actually
a very good friend of Roman's.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.166
Don't worry. I like you too.

10:14.166 --> 10:15.125
Hello.

10:15.208 --> 10:17.041
Office visits are on Tuesday mornings.

10:17.125 --> 10:19.291
So unless you have the clap,
come back tomorrow.

10:19.375 --> 10:20.583
I'm off to see patients.

10:20.666 --> 10:23.541
No. Actually, I'm here for the job.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.833
You don't look
anything like a country nurse.

10:26.916 --> 10:29.333
I used to be a caregiver
in a hospital in Paris, but--

10:29.416 --> 10:31.041
They fired you for being slow?

10:31.125 --> 10:34.333
-No, COVID, burnout.
-Well, then.

10:34.416 --> 10:38.041
I really need to work.
My wife is pregnant again.

10:38.125 --> 10:39.833
-And…
-Okay.

10:39.916 --> 10:41.375
It would be great for me.

10:43.041 --> 10:44.500
Okay, never mind. Thank you.

10:45.750 --> 10:47.125
That dumbass is leaving.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.083
Hey, come on. Hurry up.

10:56.083 --> 10:57.708
-Antoine.
-Nicole.

10:57.791 --> 10:58.625
Pleasure.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.750
Antoine is at work, and I'm Eddy's mother.

11:01.833 --> 11:04.333
I'm his mom, Emilie Châtaigne-Ben Smires.

11:04.416 --> 11:06.375
-Look!
-You've never been here before.

11:06.458 --> 11:07.291
Eddy?

11:07.375 --> 11:10.125
-Tell her I'm your mommy.
-Not in front of the children.

11:10.208 --> 11:12.416
When there's a conflict, we talk to Roxy.

11:13.291 --> 11:14.791
The lady is very late.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.125
The only people on the list
who can pick up Eddy

11:17.208 --> 11:18.958
are his dad and Charlotte Ben Smires…

11:19.041 --> 11:21.291
-Excuse me?
-…who's never come, and isn't you.

11:21.375 --> 11:23.291
Wait, Charlotte? That makes no sense.

11:23.375 --> 11:25.500
Eddy, it's Mommy!

11:25.583 --> 11:28.291
We can't let just anyone inside.

11:28.375 --> 11:29.750
Wait, "just anyone"?

11:29.833 --> 11:31.458
I'm his mother. We--

11:32.083 --> 11:33.916
No, I'm sorry. I'm not talking to--

11:38.833 --> 11:42.916
There's always someone to make trinkets
out of toilet paper for Mother's Day.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.250
But nobody's willing
to help a working mother.

11:45.333 --> 11:46.666
Eddy, are you coming?

11:47.833 --> 11:50.625
A community canteen
to welcome the poor and influencers.

11:50.708 --> 11:52.166
Maybe students, but…

11:53.333 --> 11:54.291
Hello, everyone.

11:55.541 --> 11:56.375
Thank you.

11:56.458 --> 11:59.291
Maxime Pauillac! Pauillac!

11:59.791 --> 12:00.625
Thank you.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.416
Allow me to introduce myself.

12:04.041 --> 12:08.750
My name is Maxime Pauillac, even though
I assume some of you figured it out.

12:11.708 --> 12:15.375
We are here to inaugurate a place, yes,

12:16.458 --> 12:20.916
but mostly to launch a movement of hope
for the residents of the 9th district.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.291
And, if there's one person here
who embodies this modernity…

12:25.375 --> 12:26.708
A little improv?

12:26.791 --> 12:28.458
…it's Charlotte Ben Smires.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.458
My loyal campaign…

12:31.041 --> 12:31.958
Campaign!

12:32.916 --> 12:33.750
Companion.

12:37.750 --> 12:38.958
He's awesome.

12:40.541 --> 12:41.750
-Charlotte.
-Yes.

12:42.250 --> 12:44.875
Charlotte Ben Smires.
A woman bred from immigration.

12:44.958 --> 12:46.958
That was a very long time ago…

12:47.041 --> 12:48.291
An outraged woman.

12:48.375 --> 12:50.541
A woman who has been broken.

12:51.750 --> 12:54.125
A woman who was tormented.

12:54.708 --> 12:56.541
Okay, he's completely lost his mind.

12:56.625 --> 12:57.791
The woman of my dreams.

12:59.041 --> 13:00.000
Excuse me.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.125
That is pretty cute.

13:04.208 --> 13:07.500
So much the one,
that she became, out of love,

13:07.583 --> 13:09.958
and out of passion for me,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.500
our movement's first private donor.

13:13.583 --> 13:16.708
-It's embarrassing that he said it.
-That's true.

13:16.791 --> 13:18.791
A woman with whom
I've formed the greatest team,

13:19.791 --> 13:20.791
and soon…

13:22.083 --> 13:24.250
the greatest of families. <i>Inshallah!</i>

13:25.416 --> 13:26.666
-Congratulations.
-Huh?

13:26.750 --> 13:29.125
No, that's not true. Not at all.

13:29.625 --> 13:32.625
He made me take a test,
and my pill is working just fine.

13:32.708 --> 13:34.416
Thank you all for coming.

13:34.916 --> 13:36.583
Thank you.

13:37.750 --> 13:41.208
Pauillac for president!

13:41.291 --> 13:43.500
It's crazy how
I don't miss the girls at all.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.291
Can you look at someone's stories
without them knowing?

13:47.375 --> 13:48.416
I don't know.

13:49.458 --> 13:52.041
-Can I go back to my shed?
-Stay with me a while.

13:52.125 --> 13:54.625
We can put Eddy to bed
and do each other's hair.

13:56.250 --> 13:59.041
Yeah, it's me again.
Where did you put Eddy's slippers?

13:59.875 --> 14:01.375
Even Matt can't find them.

14:01.458 --> 14:04.625
What last drawer?
That doesn't make any sense.

14:04.708 --> 14:06.500
-Yes, it does.
-No, but…

14:06.583 --> 14:08.416
What last drawer?

14:08.500 --> 14:10.208
Got them. Yeah, bye.

14:10.291 --> 14:11.708
I have to deal with everything.

14:12.416 --> 14:14.750
Isn't it super weird
to hide slippers in a drawer?

14:14.833 --> 14:16.625
-No.
-It's weird.

14:16.708 --> 14:18.833
-It doesn't make any sense.
-It's weird.

14:18.916 --> 14:19.833
Eddy!

14:24.000 --> 14:25.125
I was great, wasn't I?

14:25.833 --> 14:27.208
Yeah, great.

14:27.750 --> 14:29.791
-All right. I'm off.
-Yeah.

14:29.875 --> 14:32.250
-You didn't say any of the stuff I wrote.
-Totally.

14:33.041 --> 14:36.125
You know, Elsa's right.
It makes sense for us to have kids.

14:36.208 --> 14:39.125
That's what De Gaulle used to say.
Work, family, country.

14:39.208 --> 14:41.625
No, that's Pétain.

14:41.708 --> 14:42.875
-That's Pétain?
-Yeah.

14:42.958 --> 14:45.916
There's our Kennedy!

14:46.458 --> 14:47.666
Way to go, son!

14:47.750 --> 14:49.666
She's radiant!

14:50.250 --> 14:52.291
And that complexion! You're so lucky!

14:52.958 --> 14:56.083
-Jacques and Solange, my parents.
-And soon-to-be grandparents.

14:56.166 --> 14:57.541
Yes, we can't wait.

14:57.625 --> 14:59.083
Though she's still a bit young.

15:00.208 --> 15:03.041
-Is she coming to dinner tonight?
-Yeah, great. Great.

15:05.041 --> 15:07.791
<i>-Where's the baby food?</i>
-What do you mean?

15:07.875 --> 15:10.875
<i>-Well, Eddy's food.</i>
-Milou, we don't buy it anymore.

15:10.958 --> 15:12.083
<i>Oh, shit. Why?</i>

15:12.166 --> 15:15.291
Because Eddy's almost three.
So he eats like us now.

15:15.375 --> 15:17.041
<i>Awesome! I'll give him foie gras.</i>

15:17.125 --> 15:19.416
-No, not foie gras.
<i>-But you said, "like us".</i>

15:19.500 --> 15:21.833
Hey, Milou, how about
you give Tintin here a break?

15:21.916 --> 15:22.916
<i>Hello, who is…</i>

15:25.708 --> 15:26.625
Sorry…

15:26.708 --> 15:29.208
No wonder you're slow. You're exhausted.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Mental load isn't just a woman's thing.

15:34.791 --> 15:37.458
There you go.
I'm not a naturally slow person.

15:38.708 --> 15:40.000
Yeah, I mean…

15:40.083 --> 15:41.291
Don't get carried away.

15:45.291 --> 15:46.583
To the <i>One Old Woman Show!</i>

15:47.958 --> 15:51.458
Elsa, you want to get off your butt
and celebrate our new project?

15:52.250 --> 15:53.916
Chug!

15:55.291 --> 15:56.125
Here.

15:56.208 --> 15:57.875
No, I don't drink alcohol.

15:58.666 --> 16:00.958
-Finally!
-No, I'm just getting ready.

16:03.708 --> 16:05.958
Piotr would never have agreed to this.

16:06.041 --> 16:07.708
Elsa, you get to keep your job.

16:07.791 --> 16:09.625
You're giving Roman work.

16:09.708 --> 16:11.833
-That Suzanne of yours is cool.
-What?

16:13.708 --> 16:15.208
I slept with her last night.

16:16.208 --> 16:19.166
No, Chantal. We said no clits on the job.

16:19.250 --> 16:20.333
It causes trouble!

16:20.416 --> 16:23.083
This is different, I swear.
There's something there.

16:23.166 --> 16:24.458
She's awesome.

16:24.541 --> 16:25.625
Just look at her.

16:28.041 --> 16:30.500
-Oh boy, I think I'm a little in love.
-Well, yes.

16:32.583 --> 16:33.583
Wait.

16:33.666 --> 16:35.875
Like I was saying,
be like Catherine Deneuve,

16:35.958 --> 16:38.083
but keep that Stuart Little side too.

16:38.166 --> 16:39.333
Get it?

16:39.416 --> 16:41.791
That's right.
Theater is precise. It's a job.

16:42.666 --> 16:43.833
You fascinate me.

16:44.583 --> 16:46.250
I want to eat your nipples.

16:46.875 --> 16:47.708
Huh?

16:51.708 --> 16:53.208
Let's take a little photo.

16:53.291 --> 16:54.250
Great, hang on.

16:58.375 --> 16:59.666
-Our little family.
-Great.

16:59.750 --> 17:01.375
Hang on. I'll take one too.

17:01.458 --> 17:03.666
No, she can post mine. It'll be better.

17:03.750 --> 17:05.083
How about a Scotch, kid?

17:05.166 --> 17:07.583
-Don't mind if I do, boss.
-Why not, boss?

17:08.666 --> 17:11.916
Well, she's going
to help me slice the terrine.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.166
Yeah, sure.

17:15.875 --> 17:17.625
She noticed my big boobies.

17:17.708 --> 17:19.166
I saw her little glance.

17:19.750 --> 17:21.041
Booboo told me everything.

17:21.125 --> 17:22.125
Booboo?

17:22.208 --> 17:24.375
Well, you catch more flies with honey.

17:24.458 --> 17:28.083
And Gaïa was at least a 34D.

17:28.166 --> 17:29.458
That's why he dumped Lisa.

17:30.208 --> 17:31.041
Lisa?

17:31.125 --> 17:32.416
Your friend.

17:32.500 --> 17:33.625
The A cup.

17:33.708 --> 17:34.791
Extremely left wing.

17:34.875 --> 17:36.250
Oh, Elsa!

17:36.791 --> 17:37.958
Yeah, but…

17:38.583 --> 17:41.166
-She's not speaking to her.
-Not speaking to you?

17:41.250 --> 17:43.416
No, I'm not speaking to her.

17:43.500 --> 17:47.125
You say "she" when you mean "me,"
so it's "she's not speaking to her."

17:47.208 --> 17:48.333
Anyways, it's…

17:49.291 --> 17:51.291
The terrine is already sliced.

17:51.375 --> 17:52.708
Of course it is.

17:52.791 --> 17:55.458
-Of course.
<i>-It's crazy how I don't miss the girls.</i>

17:55.541 --> 17:57.791
-Are Max's parents nice?
-They were horrible.

17:57.875 --> 17:59.875
And the mother had everything redone.

17:59.958 --> 18:01.333
-You can tell.
-Disgusting.

18:02.166 --> 18:03.041
I hate it.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.041
Here! We're going to have a blast.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.083
Give me a hand.

18:06.166 --> 18:09.250
We're in for a treat.
We're going to eat till we pop.

18:09.333 --> 18:10.250
I love it.

18:13.125 --> 18:15.375
But, you know, Mom, we're vegetarian.

18:15.458 --> 18:16.375
You are?

18:17.833 --> 18:19.083
Well, that's news to me.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.458
It's been two years.

18:21.291 --> 18:23.916
Well, I don't know, eat the breading?

18:24.791 --> 18:26.416
No, it has animal fat.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.208
You guys are boring.

18:31.875 --> 18:32.750
I'm sorry?

18:32.833 --> 18:34.375
I don't know, honestly…

18:35.291 --> 18:36.208
No, you're boring.

18:36.916 --> 18:39.583
It's not just you two,
but your generation.

18:39.666 --> 18:42.750
You don't eat this. You don't eat that.
You don't ride planes.

18:42.833 --> 18:45.375
You don't take baths.
You don't buy any clothes.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.166
All you want is to land
a stable job. No, honestly.

18:49.750 --> 18:52.208
You're like little old people
scared of everything.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.916
How can you have kids
if you don't have sex?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.166
Mom, I told you, we're abstaining.

18:58.250 --> 18:59.916
-Abstaining?
-Yeah, abstaining.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.750
In order to be more fertile after.

19:01.833 --> 19:02.958
How Mormon of you.

19:03.041 --> 19:05.791
I'm going to get dessert
so we can eat something.

19:05.875 --> 19:06.791
Yeah.

19:07.708 --> 19:08.541
What?

19:08.625 --> 19:11.041
At your age,
if I so much as looked at a crotch,

19:11.125 --> 19:12.708
I got pregnant. Just like that!

19:13.750 --> 19:16.041
Good thing I didn't keep them all because…

19:18.083 --> 19:19.875
So how did you meet?

19:20.791 --> 19:21.916
At work.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.416
I was his secretary.

19:24.125 --> 19:25.041
Kind of like her.

19:25.125 --> 19:27.083
No, because I'm not really his--

19:27.166 --> 19:28.333
<i>Alta, altais…</i>

19:29.458 --> 19:30.541
<i>Patent!</i>

19:30.625 --> 19:31.666
<i>Patent.</i>

19:33.416 --> 19:36.166
"The heavens open to those
who have wings." Family motto.

19:36.250 --> 19:37.583
Yeah, that's lovely.

19:38.333 --> 19:40.916
What matters
in a relationship is to be a team.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.500
Speaking of that, darling.
Go get me a little Coke.

19:43.583 --> 19:44.666
Right.

19:48.416 --> 19:49.708
-She loves you.
-Yeah?

19:49.791 --> 19:51.291
-Yeah.
-A lot.

19:51.375 --> 19:53.291
-Really?
-You're really scoring points.

19:54.041 --> 19:56.833
Companion points.

19:58.666 --> 20:00.375
Companion points.

20:01.458 --> 20:03.541
-I don't think she gets it.
-She does.

20:04.083 --> 20:05.000
You got it, right?

20:05.083 --> 20:06.625
Yes. She got it.

20:06.708 --> 20:08.875
It's just that it's not very funny.

20:10.708 --> 20:13.041
You're the worst example
of a mother in the world.

20:14.541 --> 20:18.083
All my friends manage to get pregnant,
even when they don't want to.

20:19.166 --> 20:20.166
And I can't.

20:21.625 --> 20:22.541
And you know why?

20:22.625 --> 20:24.833
No. I suppose it's my fault.

20:24.916 --> 20:27.916
Because during childhood,
you fed me nuggets twice a week.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.958
Burgers, all the junk food.

20:30.041 --> 20:32.625
Phthalates, BPDE, BPA, paraben,

20:32.708 --> 20:34.458
alkylphenol, triclosan,

20:34.541 --> 20:36.125
endocrine disruptors…

20:36.208 --> 20:38.291
Give it a rest! Maybe it's him!

20:38.375 --> 20:41.875
-He eats nothing but seeds!
-Mom, I'm telling you, it's me.

20:42.958 --> 20:44.416
I'm scared of being like you.

20:52.375 --> 20:53.291
There you go.

20:53.375 --> 20:54.583
-There I go.
-My love…

20:59.041 --> 21:01.708
Well, she's being Elsa.
You must be used to it.

21:01.791 --> 21:04.708
-Sometimes you need to shake her up.
-Yeah, or support her.

21:05.291 --> 21:06.916
-Listen to her.
-Yeah.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.666
It's not easy for me either.
Natural methods.

21:09.750 --> 21:13.166
Then get some help.
Get an IVF instead of eating tofu.

21:13.250 --> 21:15.708
-Aren't you sick of talking shit?
-No.

21:15.791 --> 21:19.291
We also want to feel free,
to live carefree, to not give a damn.

21:20.083 --> 21:23.666
And today, we're dealing with the crap
your generation left behind.

21:23.750 --> 21:27.000
One thing's for sure,
our child won't inherit our mistakes.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.833
He'll know he was my choice.

21:30.875 --> 21:31.833
And not a burden.

21:40.583 --> 21:41.416
Matt!

21:41.500 --> 21:43.958
-I have amazing news for Decountrymom!
-Great.

21:45.833 --> 21:47.041
Aren't you going to ask?

21:47.750 --> 21:48.625
What's the news?

21:48.708 --> 21:49.833
I'll tell you later.

21:49.916 --> 21:51.416
Can you watch Eddy?

21:51.500 --> 21:53.166
-Yeah, sure.
-BFF!

21:53.916 --> 21:55.916
Wait. Let's come up with a special shake.

21:56.000 --> 21:56.875
Come on.

21:56.958 --> 21:59.000
Sorori… No, hang on.

21:59.083 --> 22:01.625
Fraterni… Please, come up with something.

22:01.708 --> 22:04.125
-I don't know.
-No, I don't have time.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.000
It's here.

22:22.500 --> 22:23.333
Oh, shit.

22:23.416 --> 22:24.375
Is anyone here?

22:27.583 --> 22:28.416
Okay.

22:36.000 --> 22:36.875
Anyone here?

22:41.333 --> 22:42.333
Anyone here?

22:42.916 --> 22:45.583
It's Emilie Châtaigne, from Decountrymom.

22:46.500 --> 22:47.791
We have an appointment.

23:30.666 --> 23:32.333
Good evening. Sorry, hello.

23:33.500 --> 23:35.708
Mermaids. Do you believe in mermaids?

23:35.791 --> 23:37.625
I love mermaids.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.500
-Why be only human?
-Yeah.

23:39.583 --> 23:40.666
That's true. Why?

23:40.750 --> 23:42.208
-Because we're not…
-Why?

23:43.750 --> 23:45.416
Come. Let's go into the garden.

23:45.500 --> 23:46.833
Won't you be cold?

23:47.541 --> 23:48.500
I'm a fan.

23:48.583 --> 23:50.708
I follow you on Instagram. You're amazing.

23:50.791 --> 23:52.166
But I'm not on Instagram.

23:52.250 --> 23:53.291
-You're not?
-No.

23:53.375 --> 23:54.375
But I follow you.

23:56.083 --> 23:57.875
-You break this with the thing.
-Hi.

23:59.583 --> 24:01.416
-Hi, baby.
-Look who's here.

24:01.958 --> 24:03.625
It's Daddy coming home from work.

24:04.500 --> 24:07.166
And it looks like
he had a really shitty night.

24:08.208 --> 24:09.166
I sure did.

24:09.250 --> 24:10.083
There!

24:10.166 --> 24:13.583
Talk about getting back into it.
Food poisoning in a retirement home.

24:13.666 --> 24:16.000
-Wonderful.
-It was quite the job. Can I get a kiss?

24:16.083 --> 24:18.375
You won't kiss Daddy?
I'll kiss you anyway.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.458
You stay with Uncle Matt.

24:20.541 --> 24:22.791
-You like Uncle Matt best.
-How are you?

24:22.875 --> 24:24.916
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Is Milou home?

24:25.000 --> 24:27.625
She left me with Eddy.
I don't know what she's up to.

24:27.708 --> 24:28.958
Can you play by yourself?

24:30.833 --> 24:32.875
-Can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

24:34.250 --> 24:37.166
Is something going on
with this pregnancy thing?

24:37.750 --> 24:39.083
No, why would there be?

24:39.625 --> 24:40.708
I don't know.

24:40.791 --> 24:44.291
You aren't annoying like other couples
who can't stop talking about it.

24:45.250 --> 24:46.291
You never do.

24:46.375 --> 24:48.541
It's our second.
We don't need to talk about it.

24:48.625 --> 24:50.000
It just makes sense.

24:50.083 --> 24:52.000
You're happy?
Looking forward to this baby?

24:53.208 --> 24:54.666
Yeah. I mean,

24:55.416 --> 24:57.250
I just need to get used to the idea,

24:57.333 --> 24:58.833
but that's it.

24:59.583 --> 25:00.750
It…

25:02.791 --> 25:03.875
It makes Milou happy.

25:04.458 --> 25:06.958
I guess that makes sense too, of course.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.416
So you're doing a digital detox?

25:12.500 --> 25:15.208
Well, you're safe here.
There's barely any reception.

25:15.750 --> 25:17.916
But that's great because it's calm.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.708
-Far away from the frenzy.
-Oh, no.

25:19.791 --> 25:22.416
-I actually hate when it's calm.
-Really?

25:22.500 --> 25:23.416
The calm…

25:23.958 --> 25:26.875
Life is about others.
Life is made for dancing.

25:26.958 --> 25:29.875
In fact, I plan on
inviting many people here.

25:29.958 --> 25:31.541
You do? Like who?

25:32.416 --> 25:35.666
Tell me, how much time
would it take to redo everything?

25:35.750 --> 25:39.500
Redo everything, meaning…?
The bathroom? The kitchen?

25:41.375 --> 25:42.416
Everything.

25:42.500 --> 25:46.083
Because you see, I'm planning
to have a ballroom in the barn,

25:46.166 --> 25:47.708
I mean, like a nightclub, etc.

25:47.791 --> 25:49.875
And I need eight guest bedrooms.

25:49.958 --> 25:52.791
Eight guest bedrooms?
All right. I'll take some notes.

25:52.875 --> 25:55.125
And I love foaming fountains

25:55.208 --> 25:57.375
with tritons, dolphins, and all that.

25:57.458 --> 25:58.833
Wow, okay.

25:58.916 --> 26:01.166
And a music studio.

26:01.250 --> 26:02.250
Because you sing.

26:02.333 --> 26:03.500
Also, a river.

26:04.125 --> 26:05.333
-A river?
-Yes.

26:05.416 --> 26:07.541
-All right.
-And a tropical greenhouse.

26:08.208 --> 26:09.333
Okay, so…

26:10.583 --> 26:12.208
Please face the mirror.

26:13.250 --> 26:15.333
What do you want to do? Make them bigger?

26:15.833 --> 26:17.625
Because they don't sag at all.

26:19.041 --> 26:19.875
Yes.

26:20.416 --> 26:22.166
We want to make them bigger.

26:23.416 --> 26:25.125
And this is your decision?

26:25.208 --> 26:26.083
Yeah.

26:26.708 --> 26:28.000
I mean, I think so.

26:33.125 --> 26:34.166
Does this hurt?

26:37.416 --> 26:39.208
How long have you had this lump?

26:40.833 --> 26:41.791
What lump?

26:43.166 --> 26:44.500
What did she tell you?

26:45.166 --> 26:46.083
Are you okay?

26:48.000 --> 26:50.875
If it's the size you're worried about,
we can go smaller.

26:52.625 --> 26:54.458
I hear it doesn't hurt a lot.

26:55.250 --> 26:57.833
What are we talking about? Your body?

27:01.125 --> 27:02.000
You know what?

27:02.625 --> 27:04.541
We'll get a male surgeon.

27:05.333 --> 27:06.291
I'll call Mom.

27:11.958 --> 27:13.625
Are you and the girls fighting?

27:15.750 --> 27:16.583
Yes.

27:16.666 --> 27:17.916
My little butterball.

27:20.208 --> 27:22.041
-You want a smoke?
-No.

27:22.125 --> 27:24.291
-I don't smoke.
-Too bad.

27:25.541 --> 27:26.625
I'll leave you two.

27:29.875 --> 27:32.291
-We're getting our apartment back.
-How?

27:32.375 --> 27:34.333
I worked things out with the landlord.

27:34.416 --> 27:36.666
-Shall we pack our bags?
-Wait, Julio.

27:38.875 --> 27:40.541
How did you get the money?

27:42.833 --> 27:43.875
You won't like it.

27:45.166 --> 27:46.000
No.

27:46.833 --> 27:53.208
It just feels weird because usually,
Dr. Catou always gets himself replaced by…

27:55.041 --> 27:58.583
No, because there are
midwives and male obstetricians.

27:59.833 --> 28:00.666
Because…

28:00.750 --> 28:04.083
I think it's great
that things are changing.

28:04.166 --> 28:06.666
That women too… Right?

28:06.750 --> 28:08.541
Try to relax a bit.

28:10.458 --> 28:11.541
There. You all right?

28:13.458 --> 28:14.583
Come on.

28:14.666 --> 28:16.000
You can get dressed.

28:16.583 --> 28:17.583
That was quick.

28:19.625 --> 28:21.083
Is this a planned pregnancy?

28:22.291 --> 28:23.833
What kind of question is that?

28:25.208 --> 28:27.500
And anyway, he's here now.

28:27.583 --> 28:30.833
Besides, I'm 33.
I have a husband, a house,

28:30.916 --> 28:32.958
a construction project
at a celebrity's home.

28:33.541 --> 28:35.916
Don't ask me who it is. I can't tell you.

28:37.416 --> 28:39.541
I'm not a 17-year-old junkie
from Michigan.

28:39.625 --> 28:41.000
It's just a basic question.

28:41.083 --> 28:43.500
At this stage, you still have a choice.

28:44.750 --> 28:46.000
And you have the right.

28:46.083 --> 28:47.125
Yes.

28:47.208 --> 28:48.958
-You do.
-I know.

28:50.666 --> 28:52.833
-You can get dressed.
-When will he be born?

28:54.000 --> 28:56.791
So, he's due in early July.

28:56.875 --> 28:57.958
Shit.

28:58.541 --> 28:59.583
A little Cancer.

29:00.750 --> 29:01.791
A little cancer?

29:03.916 --> 29:05.916
Does that even exist?

29:06.666 --> 29:07.750
Little cancers?

29:07.833 --> 29:10.583
Theoretically, it basically means that

29:10.666 --> 29:13.041
you might only need a little procedure.

29:13.791 --> 29:16.541
Sorry, could you stop
saying "little" all the time?

29:16.625 --> 29:18.458
-Theoretically--
-That too.

29:18.958 --> 29:20.666
If you don't have any metastasis,

29:20.750 --> 29:23.291
we can remove the tumor
without affecting your breast.

29:23.375 --> 29:25.291
However, if you want children,

29:25.375 --> 29:27.875
you should think about freezing your eggs.

29:27.958 --> 29:30.875
Chemotherapy
and fertility don't get along.

29:32.500 --> 29:33.416
Cancer.

29:37.291 --> 29:38.375
So I have cancer?

29:39.208 --> 29:40.041
Yes.

29:40.583 --> 29:42.333
Yes.
