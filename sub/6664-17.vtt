Adult adam: <i> Back in the '80s,</i>
<i> america had one clear enemy...</i>

00:03.671 --> 00:04.503
<i> The russians.</i>

00:04.505 --> 00:05.971
<i> It was the age</i>
<i> of the cold war.</i>

00:05.973 --> 00:08.040
<i> Capitalism vs. Communism.</i>

00:08.042 --> 00:08.907
<i> Reagan vs. Gorbachev.</i>

00:08.909 --> 00:11.677
Rocky <i> vs. That</i>
<i> roided-out monster</i>

00:11.679 --> 00:12.378
<i> Who killed apollo creed.</i>

00:12.380 --> 00:16.015
<i> But the only war I knew</i>
<i> was the one with my brother,</i>
<i> and like any superpowers,</i>

00:16.017 --> 00:19.118
<i> Most of our fights</i>
<i> were about border disputes.</i>

00:19.120 --> 00:20.552
Dude!
You're in my space.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.721
You're in my space!

00:22.856 --> 00:25.858
Stop it.
Stop fighting.
Don't you...

00:25.860 --> 00:26.658
<i> Like any warring factions,</i>

00:26.660 --> 00:29.094
<i> We didn't understand</i>
<i> each other and had</i>
<i> nothing in common.</i>

00:29.096 --> 00:31.230
<i> Barry roller-skated to wham!</i>
<i> To impress the ladies</i>

00:31.232 --> 00:36.402
<i> While I roller-skated</i>
<i> to</i> starlight express
<i> to impress the theatergoers.</i>

00:36.404 --> 00:37.269
<i> I barely survived gym class...</i>

00:37.271 --> 00:40.572
(whistle blows)
<i> ...While barry thrived</i>
<i> as an athlete.</i>

00:40.574 --> 00:41.106
(grunts)

00:41.108 --> 00:43.609
<i> My dream was to be</i>
<i> the next steven spielberg.</i>

00:43.611 --> 00:47.046
<i> Barry's dream was to be</i>
<i> the next charles barkley.</i>

00:47.048 --> 00:48.280
Swish, baby!

00:48.282 --> 00:49.648
<i> I collected garbage pail kids</i>

00:49.650 --> 00:52.618
<i> While barry loved</i>
<i> his baseball cards.</i>

00:52.620 --> 00:53.419
Dude, check it out.

00:53.421 --> 00:55.988
I just got hairy mary
and oozy suzy.

00:55.990 --> 00:56.588
Oh, really?

00:56.590 --> 00:58.190
I got nerdy adam
and punchy barry.

00:58.192 --> 01:01.360
<i> My most prized possession</i>
<i> was my castle grayskull,</i>

01:01.362 --> 01:04.029
<i> And barry's</i>
<i> was this enormous shoe.</i>

01:04.031 --> 01:05.030
Behold, my lady.

01:05.032 --> 01:09.134
The actual high-top
of basketball's
greatest badass,

01:09.136 --> 01:10.869
Sir charles barkley.

01:10.871 --> 01:11.870
Cool.
Let me see...

01:11.872 --> 01:14.873
No! Your hand contains
damaging oils.

01:14.875 --> 01:17.810
You can admire it quietly.
At a distance.

01:17.812 --> 01:20.045
How did you even get
this thing?

01:20.047 --> 01:21.747
Dave sirota hooked me up.

01:21.749 --> 01:22.748
His dad's a team doctor.

01:22.750 --> 01:26.318
All I got to do
is his math homework
for the rest of year.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.653
That is a horrible deal
for him.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.788
Yeah, it is.
Sorry to be this dude,

01:29.790 --> 01:32.825
But it's just a shoe.
Who cares?

01:32.827 --> 01:34.026
"who cares?"

01:34.028 --> 01:35.894
This is charles barkley.

01:35.896 --> 01:37.696
The round mound
of rebound.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.665
The greatest sixer
of our time.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.700
Yeah,
basketball's not my sport.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.168
Well,
sports aren't your sport.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.404
Even my shoe thinks
you're a nerd.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.106
Huh?
What was that?

01:47.108 --> 01:49.475
"punch your brother
in the nards"?
Idiot.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.577
Your shoe sounds
a lot like you.

01:51.579 --> 01:52.878
Hey!
Knock it off.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.314
What did we discuss?
Which barry do I like?

01:55.316 --> 01:57.916
Sweet barry.
Which barry
do I hate?

01:57.918 --> 01:59.852
Yelly,
punchy barry.
Mmm-hmm.

01:59.854 --> 02:01.920
(mouthing)
adult adam: <i> Yep,</i>
<i> barry and I forever lived</i>

02:01.922 --> 02:03.088
<i> In a tense</i>
<i> and bitter cold war.</i>

02:03.090 --> 02:07.226
<i> We were always on guard,</i>
<i> never knowing when the other</i>
<i> would strike.</i>

02:07.228 --> 02:09.161
<i> And this year,</i>
<i> I decided to mount</i>

02:09.163 --> 02:11.497
<i> An epic attack</i>
<i> on April fools' day.</i>

02:11.499 --> 02:12.831
<i> My target was the one thing</i>

02:12.833 --> 02:16.702
<i> He told me never to touch</i>
<i> with my human oils.</i>

02:16.704 --> 02:17.569
Where's my barkley shoe?

02:17.571 --> 02:20.739
Relax.
I spilled some water on it,
so I threw it in the dryer.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.975
I told you not to touch
that thing!

02:22.977 --> 02:24.910
(footsteps receding)

02:24.912 --> 02:27.846
Barry:
(screams) no!

02:29.782 --> 02:31.216
Gone. (sniffles)

02:31.218 --> 02:32.818
Gone forever.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.419
Fly away,
little size 16.

02:34.421 --> 02:36.722
I'm a better person
for having known you.

02:36.724 --> 02:39.124
Well, who knew that
high heat for an hour

02:39.126 --> 02:41.126
Would do that to rubber?
Hmm.

02:41.128 --> 02:44.429
I...Feel...Anger!

02:45.832 --> 02:47.866
(laughs)

02:50.003 --> 02:51.403
(laughs)

02:51.938 --> 02:54.573
April fools'!
Oh, balls!

02:54.641 --> 02:56.842
Dude, it was
an April fools' joke.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.510
Here's the real shoe,
idiot.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.779
(laughing) oh, man.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.080
That... Yeah.

03:02.082 --> 03:04.616
It's April already.
(laughs)

03:04.618 --> 03:05.217
You got me good.

03:05.219 --> 03:09.254
Wait. Y-you destroyed
castle grayskull.

03:09.256 --> 03:10.656
You owe me 100 bucks.

03:10.658 --> 03:11.557
Yeah, not gonna happen.

03:11.559 --> 03:15.794
You should know I'm unstable
and would react poorly.
This is on you.

03:15.796 --> 03:21.433
By the power of grayskull,
this will not stand.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.536
Thought I lost you, buddy.

03:25.004 --> 03:26.238
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

03:26.240 --> 03:30.676
<i> ¶ but nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

03:32.178 --> 03:33.212
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

03:33.214 --> 03:37.316
<i> ¶ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

03:37.817 --> 03:39.551
Adult adam: <i> It was</i>
<i> April 1, 1980-something,</i>

03:39.553 --> 03:41.386
<i> And my sister</i>
<i> was spending time</i>

03:41.388 --> 03:43.288
<i> In her true home...</i>
<i> The mall.</i>

03:43.290 --> 03:45.057
Okay, what do you want
to hit next?

03:45.059 --> 03:46.992
Benetton or sam goody?

03:47.760 --> 03:48.927
Holy crap!

03:48.929 --> 03:51.530
<i> Every teenage girl has</i>
<i> a defining moment in her life.</i>

03:51.532 --> 03:53.432
<i> For my sister,</i>
<i> it was the chance</i>

03:53.434 --> 03:56.435
<i> To see her rock idol</i>
<i> jam by the food court.</i>

03:56.437 --> 03:59.871
Tiffany...Is coming...
To our mall?

03:59.873 --> 04:02.975
Sweet god,
my life now has meaning.

04:02.977 --> 04:05.310
<i> Yep, back before taylor swift</i>
<i> and katy perry,</i>

04:05.312 --> 04:08.680
<i> Teen pop superstars</i>
<i> would visit your tiny town</i>

04:08.682 --> 04:10.983
<i> And play a free concert</i>
<i> in your local mall.</i>

04:10.985 --> 04:13.652
<i> And the biggest star</i>
<i> of them all was tiffany.</i>

04:13.654 --> 04:15.287
<i> No last name needed.</i>

04:15.289 --> 04:17.522
<i> ¶ I think we're alone now ¶</i>

04:17.524 --> 04:19.858
Don't you see
what this means?

04:19.860 --> 04:21.360
I can give tiffany
my demo tape,

04:21.362 --> 04:23.395
And she can
discover me.

04:23.397 --> 04:25.430
Oh.
Just one problem.

04:25.432 --> 04:26.198
You don't have
a demo tape,

04:26.200 --> 04:28.500
And your cheap-ass dad
will never pay for one.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.501
Then there's
only one play.

04:29.503 --> 04:33.605
What if I told you
I could save you
$20,000 today?

04:33.607 --> 04:35.007
For the first time
in your life,

04:35.009 --> 04:35.941
You'd have
my full attention.

04:35.943 --> 04:39.411
Well, that's the price
of a college education
these days.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.345
And for a mere $200,

04:40.347 --> 04:44.016
I can record a music demo tape
and hand it off to tiffany,

04:44.018 --> 04:46.985
Thereby skipping college
and achieving my life dream

04:46.987 --> 04:49.855
Of becoming a teen
singing sensation.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.290
Dreams?
Who said "dreams"?

04:51.292 --> 04:53.659
Mama's here.
I support you.
Don't!

04:53.661 --> 04:57.129
She wants to sing
instead of going to college.

04:57.131 --> 04:58.196
It's a nightmare.

04:58.198 --> 04:59.331
I'm not
a total idiot.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.199
I've worked out
a surefire plan

05:01.201 --> 05:02.601
That will get me
to the top.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.136
Listen to our
snuggle monkey.

05:04.138 --> 05:07.673
She has a plan.
It's surefire.
What's the plan?

05:07.675 --> 05:11.076
I take my awesome
demo tape to the mall
and hand it to tiffany.

05:11.078 --> 05:14.179
The minute she hears
my soulful voice, boom!

05:14.181 --> 05:15.647
It happens.
What happens?

05:15.649 --> 05:17.916
I open for her in malls
across the country.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.184
That's when I get
a record deal

05:19.186 --> 05:21.320
And meat simon le bon
from duran duran

05:21.322 --> 05:23.255
At calvin klein's
lake house.

05:23.257 --> 05:24.723
Here's a plan... College!

05:24.725 --> 05:27.559
Beverly:
Oh, you're such
a grumpy pants.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.661
Just you wait.
Her plan will work.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.364
Yes!
I love you, mom.
Aw.

05:32.366 --> 05:34.166
(chuckles)
(sighs)

05:34.168 --> 05:35.667
(sighs)

05:35.669 --> 05:38.270
The (bleep) murray?
Why didn't you stop me?

05:38.272 --> 05:40.238
Stop you?
You were chewing
my head off!

05:40.240 --> 05:43.608
My baby wants to sing?
That's not a job.

05:43.610 --> 05:44.676
But you just told her
it was!

05:44.678 --> 05:47.212
You got to go up there
and tell her
she's got to go to college.

05:47.214 --> 05:48.680
Why? You just told her
she didn't!

05:48.682 --> 05:49.881
Because
I'm the dream pusher,

05:49.883 --> 05:52.651
And you're
the dream smusher.
That's how this works.

05:52.653 --> 05:55.687
This is a thing?
I'm the smusher?

05:55.689 --> 05:56.755
Yes.
I push, you smush.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.457
That's the natural order
of things.

05:58.459 --> 06:01.159
I didn't sign up for this!
You smush for once.

06:01.161 --> 06:03.995
You know, it's exhausting
always having to be
the bad guy.

06:03.997 --> 06:06.631
Well, it can't be me!
I'm the loving,
supportive one.

06:06.633 --> 06:09.935
You're the grumbling,
grouchy one
I always hide behind.

06:09.937 --> 06:12.537
Now go!
Smush, smush, smush.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.506
(groans)
(telephone rings)

06:14.508 --> 06:15.474
Hello?

06:15.476 --> 06:17.843
Adam: (on phone)
<i> have you checked on the cards?</i>

06:17.845 --> 06:18.276
What?

06:18.278 --> 06:23.215
(slowly) <i> have you checked</i>
<i> on the cards?</i>

06:24.250 --> 06:26.118
No. No!

06:26.120 --> 06:26.752
Yes. (chuckles)

06:26.754 --> 06:28.787
Barry: You drew
all over my cards!

06:28.789 --> 06:32.758
Tell me this is a joke.
Say "April fools'."
say it!

06:32.760 --> 06:33.358
No joke.

06:33.360 --> 06:36.695
One castle grayskull
for your baseball cards.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.296
Your toy's 100 bucks!

06:38.298 --> 06:39.898
This is a million dollars!

06:39.900 --> 06:40.799
They're $1 a packet.

06:40.801 --> 06:44.536
Everyone knows
they triple in value
every day.

06:44.538 --> 06:45.237
This was my nest egg.

06:45.239 --> 06:48.173
Well, I guess
you're gonna have to
work for your money now.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.875
Never.
Mark my words...

06:49.877 --> 06:53.178
You've waged a war
you cannot win.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.280
I'm coming for you,
brother.

06:55.282 --> 06:56.915
And I'm coming hard.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.183
Bring your best, bro,

06:58.185 --> 07:01.686
'cause nothing scares
adam goldberg.

07:01.688 --> 07:03.288
Oh, god. Oh, god.
Oh, god.

07:03.290 --> 07:03.989
He's gonna come at me.

07:03.991 --> 07:06.124
I told him to bring his best.
Why would I suggest that?

07:06.126 --> 07:09.628
Just apologize
for what you did
to cal ripken.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.596
We're long past
apologies now.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.232
This is all-out war,
and I'm gonna win.

07:14.234 --> 07:16.334
Kiddo,
I fought in a real war.

07:16.336 --> 07:18.737
Trust me,
there is no winner.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.172
Adult adam:
<i> Pops was right.</i>

07:20.174 --> 07:21.339
<i> While I protected my toys,</i>

07:21.341 --> 07:24.109
<i> I forgot about</i>
<i> one crucial item...</i>

07:24.111 --> 07:24.876
<i> My video camera.</i>

07:24.878 --> 07:27.546
No!
What have you done?

07:27.548 --> 07:29.948
Okay, barry,
you've gone too far.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.284
You mess with my stuff,
I mess with yours.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.852
This wasn't just stuff.

07:33.854 --> 07:36.054
This camera meant
everything.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.222
It's like my best friend.

07:37.224 --> 07:40.358
Oh, relax. All I did
was take it apart.

07:40.360 --> 07:44.863
Here's the manual.
Just... Just put it
back together.

07:46.098 --> 07:48.233
Adam: This is in chinese!

07:48.235 --> 07:50.936
Remember,
you smush, I push.

07:50.938 --> 07:53.371
Fair warning,
she's gonna get
extremely upset,

07:53.373 --> 07:54.906
And she will
throw something at you.

07:54.908 --> 07:58.877
I apologize in advance
'cause I'm gonna
let it happen.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.213
Peanut,
we need to talk.

08:01.215 --> 08:03.048
(sighs)
what do you want?

08:03.050 --> 08:06.318
I just want you
to know...

08:06.320 --> 08:07.018
(sighs)

08:07.020 --> 08:10.055
...That I support
your singing 100%.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.223
What?
Really?

08:11.225 --> 08:12.123
Really.
What?

08:12.125 --> 08:14.059
Forget about college.
Gamble your life

08:14.061 --> 08:17.629
In the dangerous
and shady world
of rock 'n' roll.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.197
For real?
So real.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.932
Unless you mom's got
something to add.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.300
Uh, not at this moment.

08:22.302 --> 08:28.139
Um, I'm just letting
the news wash over me
'cause it's so positive.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.508
(chuckles)
dad, I give you
my word

08:29.510 --> 08:31.409
When riki gold
sweeps the grammys,

08:31.411 --> 08:33.778
You're will be
the first person I thank.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.013
Riki gold?

08:35.015 --> 08:36.047
Yeah,
it's my stage name.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.283
'cause goldberg is...
You know.

08:38.285 --> 08:41.419
You can be whoever
you damn well please

08:41.421 --> 08:45.590
Because daddy believes
in you and your plan.

08:45.592 --> 08:46.224
Ooh, thanks, dad!

08:46.226 --> 08:47.859
Adult adam: <i> With that,</i>
<i> my dad became the pusher...</i>

08:47.861 --> 08:49.327
I'm so excited!
<i> ...Forcing my mom</i>

08:49.329 --> 08:50.896
<i> To become the smusher.</i>
Thank you.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.097
It's a bad plan.

08:52.099 --> 08:53.698
What?
You know I love you,

08:53.700 --> 08:56.501
But you are gonna
go to college
and get a good job

08:56.503 --> 08:59.337
So I don't have to
stay up late
at night worrying.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.605
So, basically,
you're a sham.

09:00.607 --> 09:04.809
Every time that you said
you believed in me,
it was a lie?

09:04.811 --> 09:07.345
Of course not.
It's still me.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.514
It's your mama,
snuggle monkey.
(scoffs)

09:09.516 --> 09:13.018
Lies! I am not
your snuggle monkey.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.753
You don't mean that.

09:14.755 --> 09:15.754
Oh, I mean it.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.890
And you can never call me
snuggly or squishy

09:18.892 --> 09:21.626
Or boopie or schmoopie
ever again.

09:21.628 --> 09:24.429
Do not take schmoopie
away from me.

09:24.431 --> 09:25.997
Don't you dare!

09:25.999 --> 09:28.066
It's just I...

09:28.068 --> 09:29.200
I don't want you to fail.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.836
Well, that makes me want
to succeed even more.

09:31.838 --> 09:34.272
I will sing for quarters
on the subway.

09:34.274 --> 09:38.677
I will sleep on lumpy couches
owned by creepy disk jockeys.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.045
Sure,
when times get tough,

09:40.047 --> 09:43.381
I may have to go cry
in a bank vestibule.

09:43.383 --> 09:44.349
But then, in the end,

09:44.351 --> 09:47.118
I will be bigger than
tiffany and debbie gibson.

09:47.120 --> 09:50.589
But not madonna,
because I'm realistic.

09:53.192 --> 09:54.926
(sighs)

09:55.394 --> 09:58.296
Adult adam:
<i> Since neither of my parents</i>
<i> wanted to be the smusher,</i>

09:58.298 --> 10:00.398
<i> They turned to</i>
<i> erica's teacher for help.</i>

10:00.400 --> 10:03.068
Thank you so much
for meeting with us
on a Saturday.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.704
Honestly, we really do
appreciate it.

10:05.706 --> 10:06.771
Anything for erica.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.673
In all of my years
of teaching,

10:08.675 --> 10:12.210
I have never had a student
so passionate and talented.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.779
Oh, that is so nice
to hear.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.781
And I'm gonna need you
to shut your mouth

10:16.783 --> 10:18.750
And never say that again.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.151
What? I...

10:20.153 --> 10:21.152
Let me chime in here.

10:21.154 --> 10:24.923
Actively destroy her dreams.
Thank you so much.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.391
(chuckling) yeah,
I'm not gonna agree to that.

10:26.393 --> 10:30.595
I'm her teacher.
It is my job to inspire her,
not to hold her back.

10:30.597 --> 10:32.464
Let me pipe in here, mur.

10:32.466 --> 10:33.298
We would appreciate it

10:33.300 --> 10:35.533
If you would shame her
into quitting

10:35.535 --> 10:39.371
Using, say, scare tactics
or negative reinforcement.

10:39.373 --> 10:43.108
I don't want to tell you
how to do your job.
You get it.

10:43.110 --> 10:43.808
I really don't get it.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.577
Let me
sound off here, bev.

10:45.579 --> 10:47.112
What my wife
is trying to say,

10:47.114 --> 10:49.547
And I think we can
all agree on this,

10:49.549 --> 10:52.384
A career in music,
it's absurd.

10:52.386 --> 10:55.420
(scoffs)
I...Don't agree.

10:55.422 --> 10:56.588
Let me finish this off,
mur.

10:56.590 --> 10:58.423
See, millions of girls
want to be stars,

10:58.425 --> 11:02.694
But they end up becoming
waitresses or dog walkers
or music teachers.

11:02.696 --> 11:07.332
And that is no life
anyone would wish
for their little girl.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.433
No offense.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.468
Literally couldn't be
more offended.

11:10.470 --> 11:11.736
Let me take
the wheel here, bev.

11:11.738 --> 11:14.639
Uh, you know what?
Don't take wheel.
Okay? (laughs)

11:14.641 --> 11:16.741
Beverly,
I cannot believe this.

11:16.743 --> 11:18.643
I... Even though
you give me hives

11:18.645 --> 11:22.213
And I am stalked
in my dreams
by a blond monster,

11:22.215 --> 11:26.484
I have always respected
the way that you support
your kids no matter what.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.486
(sighs)
look. It's just...

11:28.488 --> 11:32.023
What she wants to do,
it's such a long shot.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.525
It is if you're not
there for her.

11:33.527 --> 11:36.061
Do you think that tiffany
or debbie gibson

11:36.063 --> 11:38.496
Would have made it
without their mothers?

11:38.498 --> 11:38.830
No.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.398
They not only support
their daughters,

11:40.400 --> 11:42.200
They manage
their whole careers.

11:42.202 --> 11:42.901
What's that, now?

11:42.903 --> 11:46.304
Adult adam: <i> My mom realized</i>
<i> that she could hijack</i>
<i> erica's career</i>

11:46.306 --> 11:49.641
<i> And be both a mom</i>
<i> and a manager.</i>

11:49.643 --> 11:50.041
Momager.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.477
<i> While my mom was plotting</i>
<i> erica's rise to stardom,</i>

11:52.479 --> 11:55.046
<i> I was planning</i>
<i> barry's fall from grace.</i>

11:55.048 --> 11:56.014
<i> I'd win the cold war</i>

11:56.016 --> 11:58.650
<i> By taking away the one thing</i>
<i> he loved most...</i>

11:58.652 --> 12:00.418
<i> His hot lady friend.</i>

12:00.420 --> 12:01.820
Hi, um, lainey.

12:01.822 --> 12:05.056
Look, I know I showed my bra
to dave kim for five bucks,

12:05.058 --> 12:06.124
But it's not, like,
a thing.

12:06.126 --> 12:09.327
No. I'm afraid
I'm the bearer
of bad news.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.929
Barry asked me
to come here

12:10.931 --> 12:13.465
And terminate
your relationship.

12:13.467 --> 12:16.034
Yeah, that's just not
realistic, dude.

12:16.036 --> 12:16.768
Damn it.

12:16.770 --> 12:17.802
What's going on
with you two?

12:17.804 --> 12:19.704
He broke
my video camera.

12:19.706 --> 12:21.206
Why would he do that?

12:21.208 --> 12:22.741
I told him I liked
sweet barry.

12:22.743 --> 12:25.243
Turns out,
there is no sweet barry...

12:25.245 --> 12:28.680
Only yelly,
punchy barry.

12:28.682 --> 12:31.282
I don't want to say
that you could do better,

12:31.284 --> 12:33.384
But we're all thinking it.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.486
Hmm.

12:34.488 --> 12:35.086
You are so dead!

12:35.088 --> 12:37.388
Am I?
'cause I've never
felt more alive.

12:37.390 --> 12:40.225
Lainey said she had to think
about our future.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.226
I can't have her thinking.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.727
What if she sees me
for what I am?

12:42.729 --> 12:44.262
Well, maybe you should have
thought of that

12:44.264 --> 12:45.997
Before you were
who you are.

12:45.999 --> 12:49.067
I...Feel...Anger!

12:52.605 --> 12:53.438
What the hell?

12:53.440 --> 12:56.441
Where's all your nerd stuff
for me to stomp on?

12:56.443 --> 12:57.375
Put it all in storage.

12:57.377 --> 13:01.079
Now I live in a room
without joy and happiness.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.915
In...Your...Face.

13:04.583 --> 13:06.484
I can't believe it.

13:06.719 --> 13:09.287
You actually beat me.

13:11.357 --> 13:13.124
April fools'.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.660
Adult adam: <i> As my brother</i>
<i> was preparing to take me down,</i>

13:15.662 --> 13:17.929
<i> Tiffany was preparing</i>
<i> to take the stage</i>

13:17.931 --> 13:20.565
<i> In front of a thousand</i>
<i> screaming teenage girls.</i>

13:20.567 --> 13:21.299
Erica: Sorry, guys.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.102
Just got to squeeze
right through you.
Yeah, thanks.

13:24.104 --> 13:27.338
Oh, excuse me. Hi.
I'm er... I'm, uh, riki gold.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.640
And, uh,
I just wanted to know

13:28.642 --> 13:30.875
If you could give
this demo tape to tiffany

13:30.877 --> 13:32.677
And let her know
that I recorded it

13:32.679 --> 13:34.379
On my broken boom box
in my bathroom,

13:34.381 --> 13:35.647
Which isn't
totally soundproof.

13:35.649 --> 13:38.082
You can kind of hear my dad
yelling in the background.

13:38.084 --> 13:41.886
But in the end, uh, my voice
totally shines through.

13:41.888 --> 13:42.654
Sure thing, kid.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.589
Oh, my god.
It actually worked.

13:44.591 --> 13:45.857
Adult adam:
<i> It did not work.</i>

13:45.859 --> 13:48.960
<i> Every other girl in town</i>
<i> had a demo tape, too.</i>

13:48.962 --> 13:51.563
Wow.
That's a lot of tapes.

13:51.565 --> 13:53.498
<i> But riki gold</i>
<i> had a plan b...</i>

13:53.500 --> 13:54.599
<i> Sneak up to the tour bus</i>
<i> and get discovered</i>

13:54.601 --> 13:58.903
<i> By singing directly</i>
<i> to tiffany herself.</i>
<i> It was foolproof!</i>

13:59.471 --> 14:00.071
What the hell?

14:00.073 --> 14:01.906
<i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i> every other fool in town...</i>

14:01.908 --> 14:05.243
Excuse me. Sorry.
Pardon me.
<i> ...Had the exact same plan.</i>

14:05.245 --> 14:07.345
Lainey,
what are you doing here?

14:07.347 --> 14:08.746
Duh.
I want to be famous.

14:08.748 --> 14:11.783
Uh, no, wanting to be famous
is my thing.

14:11.785 --> 14:13.718
Hi, girls. Scooch over.
Scooch.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.153
Oh, my god.
Why are you here?

14:15.155 --> 14:17.555
You parents maybe
made me question

14:17.557 --> 14:18.223
Some of my life choices.

14:18.225 --> 14:21.826
Sort of my last gasp here.
Really need this win.
(note plays)

14:21.828 --> 14:24.295
No, this is my plan.

14:24.297 --> 14:28.132
(playing guitar)
<i> ¶ children, behave</i>

14:28.134 --> 14:31.436
<i> ¶ running</i>
<i> just as fast as we can</i>

14:31.438 --> 14:34.405
<i> ¶ holding on</i>
<i> to one another's hands</i>

14:34.407 --> 14:36.307
(engine revs)
<i> ¶ trying to get away</i>

14:36.309 --> 14:37.475
<i> ¶ into the night ¶</i>
night!

14:37.477 --> 14:38.543
Tiffany!
Tiffany!

14:38.545 --> 14:39.978
Adult adam:
<i> Erica's dreams of stardom</i>

14:39.980 --> 14:42.947
<i> Were literally driving away</i>
<i> before her very eyes.</i>

14:42.949 --> 14:45.416
<i> Meanwhile, barry's dream</i>
<i> of obliterating me</i>

14:45.418 --> 14:47.118
<i> Was about to become reality.</i>

14:47.120 --> 14:49.087
<i> For years, he held onto</i>
<i> a secret weapon...</i>

14:49.089 --> 14:52.290
<i> Something so powerful</i>
<i> that it could</i>
<i> only be unleashed</i>

14:52.292 --> 14:53.658
<i> In a time of true war.</i>

14:53.660 --> 14:56.561
<i> And that time was now.</i>

14:56.929 --> 14:58.897
Oh, no.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.566
<i> Oh, yes.</i>

15:02.534 --> 15:03.368
Oh, no.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.036
<i> I had taken</i>
<i> barry's girlfriend,</i>

15:05.038 --> 15:06.905
<i> And he would take my dignity</i>
<i> by unleashing</i>

15:06.907 --> 15:09.407
<i> The most embarrassing</i>
<i> sears glamour portrait</i>

15:09.409 --> 15:12.844
<i> The world had ever seen,</i>
<i> knee-high socks and all.</i>

15:12.846 --> 15:14.879
Oh, no! (groans)

15:14.881 --> 15:16.314
Barry.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.883
Hey, buddy.
What brings you by?

15:18.885 --> 15:21.119
How?
I destroyed this photo!

15:21.121 --> 15:23.488
You mean...
This one?

15:23.490 --> 15:27.258
The one where
mom dragged you
to a studio photographer

15:27.260 --> 15:28.526
Dressed like a sad,
little dandy?

15:28.528 --> 15:32.931
And I will post it
all over the school.

15:32.933 --> 15:33.731
No! You can't!

15:33.733 --> 15:35.133
That will completely
destroy me!

15:35.135 --> 15:39.103
Oh, my god.
Pops was right!
No one wins a war.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.673
Actually,
somebody does win...

15:41.675 --> 15:43.808
Whoever's got
the bigger nuke.

15:43.810 --> 15:47.011
And I've got
the adam bomb.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.448
Adult adam:
<i> My mom had officially</i>
<i> dedicated her life</i>

15:50.450 --> 15:51.883
<i> To managing my sister's</i>
<i> music career.</i>

15:51.885 --> 15:54.886
<i> Only problem,</i>
<i> erica had no idea.</i>

15:54.888 --> 15:55.520
Erica: What the...

15:55.522 --> 15:57.855
Why is my awful
10th grade yearbook photo

15:57.857 --> 16:00.858
On t-shirts, buttons,
and bumper stickers?

16:00.860 --> 16:04.028
Because your momager
got you your first gig.

16:04.030 --> 16:07.031
You're playing
the del ennis bowling lanes

16:07.033 --> 16:07.966
At 10:00 a.M. On Tuesday!

16:07.968 --> 16:11.269
Who's gonna be
at the del ennis lanes
at 10:00 a.M. On a Tuesday?

16:11.271 --> 16:14.839
Well, del will be there
and bonnie, his wife.
She rents the shoes.

16:14.841 --> 16:19.277
And, uh, I'll be there
selling these
puffy paint t-shirts.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.311
Hmm? (chuckles)

16:20.313 --> 16:21.079
If del allows it.

16:21.081 --> 16:24.282
He's trying to take
a cut of the merch.
I'm into it with him.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.550
You don't need to know
the details.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.952
Mom, maybe,
I should...
No.

16:27.954 --> 16:29.020
You were right about me.

16:29.022 --> 16:30.755
I've supported you
your whole life.

16:30.757 --> 16:35.727
But when it really mattered,
when you really needed me,
I panicked.

16:35.729 --> 16:38.196
Well, from now on,
we're in this together...

16:38.198 --> 16:42.600
All day, every day,
on the tour bus, in hotels,

16:42.602 --> 16:44.802
You and your biggest fan,
your mama.

16:44.804 --> 16:47.805
That's why, I'm gonna
momage you
straight to the top.

16:47.807 --> 16:51.142
I'm gonna make sure
no one ever smushes
your dreams again.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.478
You have to smush
my dreams.
Murray: No, no, no.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.580
I'm out of that game.
From now on, I'm a pusher.

16:55.582 --> 16:58.383
No, mom's the pusher.
We can't have two pushers.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.818
Then I'll actually have
to follow through on things.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.320
Wait, I...I thought
this is what you wanted.

17:02.322 --> 17:06.457
Don't give it up just 'cause
your mom bought
a bunch of puffy paint.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.026
It's not just mom.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.894
I went to that mall,
and I realized

17:09.896 --> 17:12.363
There's a million girls
out there just like me.

17:12.365 --> 17:15.666
And the truth is,
you were right.

17:15.668 --> 17:18.002
I just don't have a shot.

17:18.004 --> 17:20.705
Adult adam:
<i> As erica was giving up</i>
<i> on her dreams,</i>

17:20.707 --> 17:25.209
<i> Barry was about to obliterate</i>
<i> my reality.</i>

17:26.612 --> 17:29.747
(cheering)

17:31.083 --> 17:33.284
Hey.
What's going on?

17:33.286 --> 17:36.954
Dude, it's crazy.
The berlin wall just fell.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.658
Adult adam:
<i> It was one of those moments</i>

17:40.660 --> 17:42.260
<i> You remember</i>
<i> for the rest of your life.</i>

17:42.262 --> 17:44.562
<i> A country divided,</i>
<i> coming together</i>

17:44.564 --> 17:46.164
<i> For a shining moment of peace.</i>

17:46.166 --> 17:48.399
<i> And as barry</i>
<i> watched it all unfold,</i>

17:48.401 --> 17:50.935
<i> He realized</i>
<i> it was time to end</i>

17:50.937 --> 17:52.437
<i> The war at home.</i>

17:52.439 --> 17:55.773
My camera!
How did you get
the money to fix it?

17:55.775 --> 17:57.975
I sold my barkley shoe
back to dave sirota.

17:57.977 --> 17:59.477
But what about the photo?

17:59.479 --> 18:01.212
You were about to drop
the adam bomb.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.281
I saw something today
that changed me.

18:03.283 --> 18:06.084
David hasselhoff was on top
of the great wall of china

18:06.086 --> 18:07.251
In a light-up jacket
singing about freedom.

18:07.253 --> 18:12.023
And it occurred to me,
if <i> knight rider</i> can make
can make east and west russia

18:12.025 --> 18:14.725
Find common ground,
maybe we can, too.

18:14.727 --> 18:17.328
While your facts
are wildly off,

18:17.330 --> 18:19.764
Your spirit
is right on the money.

18:19.766 --> 18:20.398
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.800
Sure, I'm athletic
and enjoy awesome stuff

18:22.802 --> 18:24.302
While everything
you know and love

18:24.304 --> 18:25.536
Is for losers
who suck at life,

18:25.538 --> 18:29.040
But even though we're from
two different worlds,

18:29.042 --> 18:31.676
I believe we can live
in harmony.

18:32.244 --> 18:35.913
Wait. You gave me back
what I love.

18:36.315 --> 18:38.249
Time to return the favor.

18:38.251 --> 18:39.951
(rapping)
<i> ¶ I'm a bad boy</i>

18:39.953 --> 18:41.352
<i> ¶ but a good guy</i>

18:41.354 --> 18:42.920
<i> ¶ on the outside, I'm tough</i>

18:42.922 --> 18:44.589
<i> ¶ on the inside, I cry</i>

18:44.591 --> 18:46.491
<i> ¶ I'm always on the streets</i>

18:46.493 --> 18:47.425
<i> ¶ rhymin' and schemin'</i>

18:47.427 --> 18:51.062
<i> ¶ but when I think</i>
<i> of your face</i>
<i> I get sensitive feelings</i>

18:51.064 --> 18:52.630
<i> ¶ I mouth off to the cops</i>

18:52.632 --> 18:53.531
<i> ¶ and get myself in trouble</i>

18:53.533 --> 18:57.368
<i> ¶ but when you bail be out</i>
<i> we watch splash and cuddle</i>

18:57.370 --> 18:59.437
<i> ¶ see, I'm a bad boy</i>

18:59.439 --> 19:00.538
<i> ¶ but a sweet guy</i>

19:00.540 --> 19:02.340
<i> ¶ I get in trouble</i>

19:02.342 --> 19:04.108
<i> ¶ and I don't know why</i>

19:04.110 --> 19:05.476
<i> ¶ so take big tasty back</i>

19:05.478 --> 19:06.544
<i> ¶ you know you can't resist</i>

19:06.546 --> 19:12.250
<i> ¶ so on a humbler note</i>
<i> I really need this ¶</i>

19:12.651 --> 19:16.154
That was...
Uncomfortable.

19:16.156 --> 19:18.789
Point is,
he got my camera fixed.

19:18.791 --> 19:19.790
That's sweet.

19:19.792 --> 19:22.059
He really is a good brother.

19:22.261 --> 19:23.794
You're not so bad
yourself.

19:23.796 --> 19:27.932
(tiffany's <i> I think</i>
<i> we're alone now</i> plays)

19:29.234 --> 19:31.035
Here. For your demo.

19:31.037 --> 19:33.971
But we agreed
you were gonna talk to mom.

19:33.973 --> 19:35.039
And I will.

19:35.041 --> 19:36.674
But I just need you to know

19:36.676 --> 19:40.945
That there's nobody else
out there like you. Nobody.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.181
Look.
I got my dream.

19:43.183 --> 19:45.283
I got this house,
I got the family, I got you.

19:45.285 --> 19:49.987
And if this is what
you really want,
I say go for it.

19:50.222 --> 19:53.157
To a parent,
that's scary as hell.

19:53.159 --> 19:55.426
But I can't have you
live your life

19:55.428 --> 19:58.496
Thinking
I held you back.

20:01.500 --> 20:04.135
<i> ¶ children, behave</i>
dad.

20:04.236 --> 20:04.802
Yeah?

20:04.804 --> 20:08.639
What you said,
that was really, um...

20:08.941 --> 20:11.209
<i> ¶ and watch how you play</i>

20:11.211 --> 20:13.344
Thank you.
<i> ¶ they don't understand</i>

20:13.346 --> 20:15.046
Anything for you,
peanut.

20:15.048 --> 20:16.447
Adult adam: <i> That's the thing</i>
<i> about family.</i>

20:16.449 --> 20:20.885
<i> You fight, you argue,</i>
<i> you wage all-out war,</i>
<i> but at the end of the day,</i>

20:20.887 --> 20:23.154
<i> You're always</i>
<i> on the same side.</i>

20:23.156 --> 20:23.955
<i> ¶ tryin' to get away</i>

20:23.957 --> 20:25.890
<i> ¶ into the night</i>
<i> 'cause in a world</i>
<i> where everyone</i>

20:25.892 --> 20:26.624
<i> Tries to smush you down,</i>

20:26.626 --> 20:30.895
<i> The one thing you got</i>
<i> is your family</i>
<i> to push you forward.</i>

20:30.897 --> 20:33.364
<i> ¶ I think we're alone now</i>

20:33.366 --> 20:37.201
<i> ¶ there doesn't seem to be</i>
<i> anyone around</i>

20:37.203 --> 20:39.036
That's my superstar
client.

20:39.038 --> 20:42.840
You're not gonna be
the momager.
We'll see.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.376
<i> ¶ ...Is the only sound ¶</i>

20:47.913 --> 20:51.415
Glad that's
gone forever.
(chuckles)

20:54.419 --> 20:56.854
(ding)

20:58.924 --> 21:00.825
Riki gold, big tasty,

21:00.827 --> 21:03.628
Thank you for meeting me
on such short notice.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.496
Meeting?
We're eating breakfast.

21:05.498 --> 21:06.697
Let me cut to the chase.

21:06.699 --> 21:09.800
What I'm looking at
are two musical giants

21:09.802 --> 21:11.369
On the precipice of greatness,

21:11.371 --> 21:12.436
And as your momager...

21:12.438 --> 21:13.804
No! (laughs)
no!

21:13.806 --> 21:16.874
...I present
"the tasty gold experience."

21:16.876 --> 21:19.076
Even better,
I won't even take 10%.

21:19.078 --> 21:21.445
You can pay me
in huggies and smoochies.

21:21.447 --> 21:23.047
Both: No!
