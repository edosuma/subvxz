00:00.140 --> 00:02.007
_

00:02.117 --> 00:05.378
- All these people?
- All these people.

00:05.403 --> 00:06.746
And you're prepared to go public?

00:06.772 --> 00:09.379
- Cath Hardacre, witness to the truth.
- Right, step away.

00:09.405 --> 00:12.127
Shocking neglect of patients
at Sheffield Alderman Hospital.

00:12.153 --> 00:15.215
- What do you want me to do?
- Go call a doctor.

00:15.241 --> 00:17.288
I need to be heard
but I need to do it the right way.

00:17.314 --> 00:19.621
These allegations of negligence
have all been

00:19.647 --> 00:21.436
fully investigated by the trust.

00:21.462 --> 00:22.911
You're suspended.

00:24.481 --> 00:25.929
You're a great nurse.

00:25.955 --> 00:27.523
I can't believe they did that to you.

00:27.549 --> 00:31.059
Anything you ever need from me
and it's yours.

00:36.614 --> 00:39.677
Dad, I think I'm going to be a doctor.

00:40.366 --> 00:42.274
It's a chance for a much better life.

00:42.911 --> 00:46.201
This is a bloody great CV.
Why the hell are you here?

00:46.227 --> 00:50.233
I was married, there were problems.
I needed a change.

00:53.167 --> 00:55.492
I want to see her.
I've got a right to see her.

00:55.571 --> 00:57.796
Always try and look
after you young doctors

00:57.822 --> 00:59.612
when you move in, right enough.

01:00.098 --> 01:03.213
Data leaks, theft of property,
drug fraud.

01:03.239 --> 01:06.855
If you see anything suspicious,
report it.

01:07.201 --> 01:08.403
So, who am I?

01:08.444 --> 01:11.863
You're Ally, but I can
still call you Mummy.

01:12.211 --> 01:13.500
Dr Sutton?

01:13.794 --> 01:15.848
Andrew Brenner. Andy.

01:22.287 --> 01:24.306
So when was the last time
you ran a trauma?

01:30.951 --> 01:34.163
<i>Hi, Cath, this is Sam Kelly
from The Sheffield Express.</i>

01:34.383 --> 01:37.600
<i>I hope this is the right number.
I need to speak to you urgently.</i>

<i>Sam Kelly, Sheffield Express.</i>

02:00.473 --> 02:03.718
- Hey, this is Cath, Cath Hardacre.
- Hey, Cath.

02:03.744 --> 02:05.927
I don't want to talk to you.
Don't call me again.

02:05.953 --> 02:06.986
Cath, hold...

02:07.012 --> 02:08.676
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:08.769 --> 02:11.198
I need to talk to you
about a patient from last week.

02:12.473 --> 02:13.855
Not here.

02:14.766 --> 02:15.851
OK.

02:21.908 --> 02:23.370
So, what's the problem?

02:25.836 --> 02:27.259
- You bastard.
- Sorry.

02:27.285 --> 02:28.972
Don't do that to me again. Sorry!

02:28.998 --> 02:31.319
I thought I'd done something wrong.
We can't do this again.

02:31.345 --> 02:33.570
- Are you ashamed of me?
- It's unprofessional.

02:33.596 --> 02:35.045
I know, that's why it's fun.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.384
Oh, sorry. Hey!

02:41.410 --> 02:44.257
There is someone fascinating from
Patient Flow here to talk to you.

02:44.283 --> 02:45.585
I'll be right out.

02:53.377 --> 02:55.046
And don't do it again.

03:04.634 --> 03:08.283
_

03:08.309 --> 03:10.254
_

03:35.392 --> 03:37.806
Hey, what happened to that
crash call? The IVDU?

03:37.832 --> 03:39.867
Self discharge against medical advice.

03:39.893 --> 03:42.478
- Did he sign a form?
- Yes.

03:45.052 --> 03:46.361
- Oh, lovely.
- _

03:48.402 --> 03:50.627
Brigitte, I thought we had a 12 o'clock.

03:50.816 --> 03:52.644
Or did I get that wrong?

03:52.670 --> 03:55.690
Right, erm, shit, five minutes?

03:57.808 --> 03:59.698
Still waiting for your passport,
I think.

04:00.588 --> 04:02.343
You know what these HR people are like.

04:02.369 --> 04:04.658
Yeah, sorry, I've been
looking for it everywhere.

04:04.684 --> 04:06.429
I can't seem to find it.

04:06.874 --> 04:08.362
Would a driver's licence work?

04:08.388 --> 04:10.835
No can do. If you can't dig it out,
you're going to need a new one,

04:10.861 --> 04:13.957
otherwise they'll stop your wages.
End of the week will be fine.

04:13.983 --> 04:14.913
OK.

04:14.938 --> 04:17.228
If you've finished harassing
my staff, I'm all yours.

04:17.254 --> 04:18.663
Ally, I won't be long.

04:27.331 --> 04:28.770
One, two, three.

04:29.943 --> 04:32.498
- What happened?
- Blindsided at a junction.

04:32.524 --> 04:33.959
- Helmet?
- In bits.

04:33.985 --> 04:37.276
Got him GCS13 at the scene.
Collared as a precaution.

04:37.332 --> 04:39.137
Oh, and his name is Ed.

04:39.311 --> 04:41.641
Ed, my name is Ally,
I'm one of the doctors.

04:41.667 --> 04:44.402
- Do you know where you are?
- I'm going to be sick.

04:44.428 --> 04:46.211
OK, we can get you something.

04:46.237 --> 04:47.662
Oh! Log roll.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.097
Oh, you're kidding.

04:56.043 --> 04:57.912
Hey, got a hold of the wife.
She's on her way down.

04:57.946 --> 05:01.058
- Want me to tell her anything?
- Just that we'll know more after the scan.

05:01.084 --> 05:04.429
Don't they teach you about aprons
in medical school?

05:04.455 --> 05:05.705
No porter?

05:05.731 --> 05:08.097
No, off sick. I'm lowering myself.

05:08.282 --> 05:10.967
Also, I've got three lunch orders
to fill when we get over there.

05:10.993 --> 05:13.572
Whoever put the scanner
next to Costa was an evil genius.

05:14.274 --> 05:15.937
Och, I'm actually an old hand.

05:15.963 --> 05:17.736
Two months' work experience
on the trolleys.

05:17.762 --> 05:19.097
You worked as a porter?

05:19.123 --> 05:20.411
Got to show commitment

05:20.437 --> 05:22.544
when your A grades
from Heriot's is not enough.

05:23.048 --> 05:25.165
Funny thing was,
I actually quite liked it.

05:25.675 --> 05:26.804
OK.

05:28.134 --> 05:29.663
I can't handle vomit.

05:29.997 --> 05:33.542
Poo I'm fine with, tramp sweat,
no problem, but vomit? Oof...

05:33.804 --> 05:35.783
- You any air freshener in that bag?
- No.

05:39.622 --> 05:41.747
Oh, fitting. Get him over.

05:41.773 --> 05:43.042
Diazepam.

05:45.637 --> 05:47.696
- Erm, I can't find it.
- There's got to be.

05:51.702 --> 05:53.111
Come and hold his arm.

05:56.763 --> 06:00.016
The line's come out.
Can you get another vent on?

06:02.192 --> 06:03.298
Ta.

06:05.568 --> 06:06.618
There.

06:06.667 --> 06:07.825
- Yep.
- Yeah.

06:09.666 --> 06:11.016
Hold it.

06:14.356 --> 06:16.587
We got sublingual midazolam?

06:19.453 --> 06:20.480
Erm, no.

06:20.506 --> 06:22.361
OK, I'm going
to need another line quick.

06:22.387 --> 06:23.966
That was the last one.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.394
But I need access.

06:34.408 --> 06:35.857
I don't know what to do.

06:38.439 --> 06:40.043
- Get his legs.
- What?

06:40.069 --> 06:41.503
- Just do it.
- OK.

06:49.557 --> 06:51.261
Right, it's in. Hold him.

07:10.309 --> 07:12.204
- You didn't.
- Aye, right up his arse.

07:12.230 --> 07:14.152
- Was that Ally's idea?
- No, my own work.

07:14.178 --> 07:16.110
- And you did it?
- Eventually.

07:16.271 --> 07:19.016
I can be very resourceful, you know.
Good job I was there.

07:19.042 --> 07:20.401
My hero!

07:21.457 --> 07:24.928
She... she lost it a bit, actually,
Ally, once the line went.

07:25.258 --> 07:27.573
- Maybe she's claustrophobic.
- Maybe.

07:27.910 --> 07:29.544
Should have heard her, though.

07:29.570 --> 07:32.378
"Midazolam," like she was
from <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> or something.

07:32.404 --> 07:35.179
- Or Sheffield.
- Whatever, somewhere foreign.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.920
Oh, you're such a racist.

07:36.946 --> 07:39.255
- I assumed you fancied her.
- Me? No.

07:39.281 --> 07:40.317
Really?

07:40.409 --> 07:41.884
Everyone else does.

07:41.910 --> 07:44.905
I don't know, they come up here,
they take our men...

07:45.401 --> 07:47.085
No, she's not really my type.

07:47.523 --> 07:49.342
I prefer a bit more attitude.

08:13.363 --> 08:16.037
Oh!

09:52.969 --> 09:54.484
If you're going to Sheffield,

09:54.517 --> 09:56.626
you could easily leave
the wee one with me.

09:57.923 --> 10:01.034
Thanks, but it's been a while.
I owe him that much.

10:01.060 --> 10:02.060
Do you?

10:02.880 --> 10:04.075
Karl is her dad.

10:04.101 --> 10:06.416
Maybe he should have thought
about that before he upped

10:06.442 --> 10:07.898
and left you with a bairn to raise.

10:09.499 --> 10:10.768
The offer's there.

10:14.666 --> 10:17.715
You can talk to me, you know,
whatever it is.

10:19.029 --> 10:21.098
Unshockable, that's me.

10:22.482 --> 10:24.477
You see what goes on
in that Take A Break,

10:24.658 --> 10:26.107
nothing will surprise you.

10:27.753 --> 10:31.882
Kidnap, incest, or both.

10:35.952 --> 10:37.807
I'm OK, I'm just tired.

10:38.660 --> 10:40.736
It doesnae pay to bottle things up...

10:41.567 --> 10:43.046
..not in your line of work.

10:44.608 --> 10:45.993
A problem shared...

10:52.867 --> 10:54.276
Can you keep a secret?

10:59.506 --> 11:00.725
I mean, really.

11:05.066 --> 11:06.795
I'm not a real doctor.

11:09.387 --> 11:10.579
What?!

11:17.817 --> 11:19.708
Oh, because you're a woman?

11:21.102 --> 11:23.877
Because you've got a bairn
and responsibilities?

11:25.640 --> 11:29.365
You are every bit as good as any
of they stuck-up bastards.

11:29.616 --> 11:31.238
You mark my words.

11:31.730 --> 11:36.124
Now, I don't want to hear
another word of that crap, OK?

11:37.588 --> 11:39.863
- OK.
- Glad we've got that straight.

11:39.911 --> 11:43.076
Now, I thought you were supposed to
be going out with that man of yours.

11:43.198 --> 11:46.038
I'm just going to ring him,
do it another night.

11:46.064 --> 11:50.159
Get some slap on, put a smile
on your face and get out there.

11:50.370 --> 11:52.973
Do you want him to hook
up with some young nurse

11:52.998 --> 11:54.985
while you're stuck here gabbing
to an old woman?

11:55.011 --> 11:56.180
No.

11:56.206 --> 11:59.229
Well, get a wiggle on
and get out of here.

13:00.674 --> 13:03.443
- Hey, I thought I was being stood up.
- Sorry, you know how it is.

13:03.469 --> 13:04.624
True, sadly.

13:05.148 --> 13:06.457
Mm.

13:07.915 --> 13:09.340
Don't worry, we're in the clear.

13:09.458 --> 13:12.845
Also, no-one who works for the NHS
could possibly afford this place.

13:12.871 --> 13:15.348
12 quid for a bloody artisan tequila!

13:15.374 --> 13:17.315
- You chose it!
- I was trying to impress you.

13:17.341 --> 13:18.510
It's not working.

13:24.505 --> 13:26.080
So, what kept you?

13:26.238 --> 13:28.183
The extradural decided to puke on me

13:28.209 --> 13:30.036
and then threw a grand mal in the lift.

13:30.522 --> 13:33.217
Oh, I am getting a tiny whiff of vomit.

13:33.243 --> 13:35.658
- Although, the Chanel's doing its best.
- I've showered.

13:35.684 --> 13:38.819
The puke will always find a way,
it's a cross we all have to bear.

13:38.845 --> 13:41.540
So, I'm guessing you need a drink.

13:41.566 --> 13:43.341
I'll have an artisan tequila,
please. Mm-hm.

13:43.367 --> 13:44.360
- Double...
- Right.

13:44.386 --> 13:45.695
- ..24 quid.
- Very funny.

13:45.928 --> 13:48.989
Sheffield...
I could always come with you.

13:49.015 --> 13:51.610
That's above and beyond.
Thank you, but he's my dad.

13:51.636 --> 13:52.931
Your mum OK?

13:52.957 --> 13:55.502
My mum died when I was eight
and ever since then,

13:55.528 --> 13:58.032
- it's just been me and him.
- See, I didn't know that.

13:58.406 --> 14:00.681
- Because I never told you.
- Exactly.

14:00.948 --> 14:03.763
One artisan tequila and most women
will tell you their life story.

14:03.846 --> 14:05.511
- Most women?
- Mm.

14:05.622 --> 14:08.985
What I mean is, I'm here if you need me.

14:09.710 --> 14:11.935
- Thanks, I'll let you know.
- Ouch!

14:12.061 --> 14:14.407
I'm just trying to do the dutiful
boyfriend thing here.

14:14.433 --> 14:16.608
Sorry, I thought
we were just having sex.

14:16.634 --> 14:19.077
Oh, shit. Too soon?

14:19.685 --> 14:22.808
So, what is this? Friends with benefits?

14:23.086 --> 14:25.426
I'm not sure I'd count you
as a friend just yet.

14:25.552 --> 14:26.794
Fair enough.

14:27.184 --> 14:30.151
I suppose I've never
officially asked you out.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.741
And how do you get asked out officially?

14:32.767 --> 14:35.311
Well, when we were in school, we
used to just write a wee note.

14:35.343 --> 14:36.052
Aww!

14:36.077 --> 14:38.693
"Will you go out with me? Yes or no."

14:38.718 --> 14:41.477
And there was, like, a little box
that you could tick. Hold on.

14:43.557 --> 14:46.502
Wow, sounds sensible. And if it's
in writing, you can't back out.

14:46.528 --> 14:47.568
Exactly.

14:47.594 --> 14:48.583
Here we go.

14:51.988 --> 14:55.850
- Box for yes, box for no.
- OK.

14:57.606 --> 15:00.080
You'd think we'd have enough
referendums.

15:00.892 --> 15:02.061
Referenda?

15:04.820 --> 15:05.939
No?

15:07.751 --> 15:09.108
You cow!

15:10.526 --> 15:12.471
All right, if I've just been dumped,

15:12.497 --> 15:14.223
I'm going to need to drown my sorrows.

15:14.249 --> 15:15.838
Hey, buddy, hello.

16:13.207 --> 16:16.446
If someone here gave out your
details, I can only apologise.

16:16.606 --> 16:19.732
All personal information should be
completely confidential.

16:20.670 --> 16:23.596
- I've changed my number.
- Of course.

16:24.302 --> 16:26.927
I'll speak to the member of staff
concerned myself.

16:26.962 --> 16:29.918
- I'd like to see my dad.
- Actually, he's with the doctor.

16:30.270 --> 16:31.349
Oh.

16:36.499 --> 16:38.304
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

16:45.123 --> 16:46.432
Hi, Dad.

16:52.863 --> 16:54.132
Are you the doctor?

16:56.532 --> 16:58.277
Yeah, I am.

16:59.318 --> 17:00.447
Let's have a listen.

17:02.834 --> 17:04.449
Can you take a deep breath for me,
please?

17:09.454 --> 17:10.762
And another.

17:24.540 --> 17:25.650
Cathy.

17:27.174 --> 17:28.305
Yeah.

17:30.454 --> 17:32.323
You always were a good girl.

17:37.078 --> 17:39.880
- Have you come to take me home?
- You are home.

17:43.344 --> 17:44.943
I'm sorry about all this.

17:46.346 --> 17:47.665
It's not fair.

17:49.106 --> 17:51.364
- It's OK.
- Where's Jessie?

17:52.878 --> 17:54.336
Mum died.

17:55.114 --> 17:57.683
A long time ago now. Do you remember?

17:59.002 --> 18:02.011
You work so hard to look after us.

18:04.444 --> 18:06.173
- I'm so proud of you, Cath.
- Oh, Dad.

18:14.144 --> 18:18.252
Er, sorry, erm, I worked
in respiratory - asthma nurse.

18:18.278 --> 18:19.564
You pick things up.

18:20.892 --> 18:23.339
We get a lot of
internet experts these days.

18:23.733 --> 18:25.438
I think this is an infection.

18:25.674 --> 18:27.656
I'm going to prescribe some antibiotics.

18:28.003 --> 18:29.601
He should be better in a day or two.

18:53.686 --> 18:58.388
_

19:04.275 --> 19:06.104
- Hey, munchkin!
- Daddy!

19:08.434 --> 19:09.790
Mwah!

19:10.027 --> 19:11.538
- You good?
- Yeah.

19:12.364 --> 19:14.919
So, it's zero hours,
but there's opportunity,

19:14.944 --> 19:17.309
you know, as long as
I can prove I'm reliable.

19:17.334 --> 19:18.245
Right.

19:18.478 --> 19:22.391
I know I've screwed things up in the
past but it is different this time.

19:23.498 --> 19:24.667
I miss her.

19:25.864 --> 19:27.043
And you.

19:30.412 --> 19:33.097
Looks good. Suits you.

19:33.123 --> 19:35.711
Thanks. I just fancied a change.

19:36.094 --> 19:37.277
Erm...

19:37.937 --> 19:41.036
Molly dropped my phone in the loo,
so I've got a new number.

19:46.788 --> 19:47.897
Thanks.

19:54.934 --> 19:58.030
Remember when we used to come here?
Her in the pushchair.

19:58.404 --> 20:00.093
Only way she'd sleep.

20:00.163 --> 20:02.504
Took it in turns to go round and round.

20:02.620 --> 20:04.095
Better than the gym.

20:04.237 --> 20:06.367
I'm glad you're doing better. Really.

20:07.367 --> 20:08.942
They've got a depot up there.

20:09.374 --> 20:10.598
Edinburgh.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.088
One step at a time.

20:14.765 --> 20:16.577
They need to know you're reliable.

20:16.603 --> 20:19.355
You're there a couple of months
and go asking for a transfer?

20:19.930 --> 20:22.518
- Yeah, I guess so.
- You know, we're fine coming down.

20:22.544 --> 20:24.170
You know, I need to see me dad anyway.

20:24.799 --> 20:26.274
We need to get going.

20:26.417 --> 20:27.491
Sure.

20:28.542 --> 20:29.853
Kiss for Daddy.

20:30.030 --> 20:31.329
Come here.

20:37.689 --> 20:39.114
When are you coming?

20:39.319 --> 20:41.586
Soon, I hope.

20:41.764 --> 20:43.114
Soon.

20:50.937 --> 20:52.321
So these falls...

20:52.347 --> 20:54.484
I don't need more help.

20:55.101 --> 20:58.107
Well, I could call social services,
get them to send someone round.

20:58.133 --> 20:59.842
Maybe you could get more
help in the morning.

20:59.868 --> 21:02.509
What, more people poking?

21:02.534 --> 21:06.069
That's my problem,
people sticking their noses in.

21:06.094 --> 21:07.506
That's me.

21:07.532 --> 21:10.638
I like nothing more than to stick my
nose into other people's business.

21:10.664 --> 21:13.689
No thanks. Patch me up, move me on.

21:13.834 --> 21:15.309
Why do you think I come here?

21:15.334 --> 21:17.093
Well, it's not for the tea.

21:17.708 --> 21:20.948
I like you a lot. Fix it and forget it.

21:21.188 --> 21:23.273
Then I can get on with my life.

21:23.517 --> 21:25.559
- Done?
- Yeah, you're free to go.

21:25.585 --> 21:26.664
Thank you.

21:28.274 --> 21:31.030
You do know the nurses'll do your
dressings for you if you ask nicely?

21:31.056 --> 21:32.320
Ah, I don't mind.

21:32.346 --> 21:33.985
Gives me time to talk to them.

21:34.401 --> 21:37.376
That is the weirdest thing any
doctor has ever said to me.

21:37.402 --> 21:39.103
Don't you like patients?

21:39.453 --> 21:40.620
They're fine.

21:40.646 --> 21:42.259
Couldn't eat a whole one.

21:42.284 --> 21:44.089
You should try it. They don't bite.

21:44.114 --> 21:46.149
Well, obviously some of them
do try and bite you.

21:46.314 --> 21:47.649
Can I ask you something?

21:47.986 --> 21:49.063
Yeah.

21:49.151 --> 21:52.296
Do you think doctors and nurses
should go out with each other?

21:52.322 --> 21:53.747
As a matter of principle.

21:53.954 --> 21:55.320
Has been known.

21:55.712 --> 21:58.811
Yeah, but is it fundamentally wrong,
against nature?

22:00.474 --> 22:02.889
You're asking me
if intelligent, well-rounded,

22:02.914 --> 22:06.332
dedicated professionals should lower
themselves to date doctors?

22:06.804 --> 22:07.974
Exactly.

22:14.399 --> 22:15.896
Just ask her.

22:16.290 --> 22:18.279
- Is it that obvious?
- It is now.

22:18.717 --> 22:21.936
Ask her. No lines, no jokes,
just be yourself.

22:21.962 --> 22:23.561
And ask her. Go.

22:27.178 --> 22:28.744
Look, I'll... I'll think about it.

22:28.770 --> 22:31.578
Seriously, why make it complicated?
It should be easy.

22:31.604 --> 22:33.013
I know it should be, but...

22:35.634 --> 22:38.139
Swollen testicles again.
Why is it testicle day?

22:38.164 --> 22:39.747
Well, at least they've got balls.

22:39.773 --> 22:41.195
Oh, ouch.

22:43.070 --> 22:44.944
It's just the butterfly that's stuck.

22:44.974 --> 22:46.349
Are you jabbing me with that?

22:46.375 --> 22:47.751
If you want me to get it out.

22:47.853 --> 22:49.162
Jeez.

22:52.464 --> 22:53.843
Have you got a minute?

22:53.869 --> 22:55.019
Yeah.

22:59.076 --> 23:00.525
I'll be one second.

23:03.664 --> 23:06.140
I'm sorry. I know you need it,
I just keep forgetting.

23:06.166 --> 23:09.029
- You know how it is.
- This is a waste of valuable time.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.819
We all know how hard you
guys are working,

23:10.844 --> 23:12.884
but if you get it to me,
then I can get off your back.

23:12.910 --> 23:15.942
OK, message delivered. I'm sure
we've all got better things to do.

23:16.290 --> 23:17.373
Sure.

23:22.280 --> 23:23.553
How was last night?

23:24.013 --> 23:25.413
Oh, lovely.

23:25.439 --> 23:29.608
We had no patients, we drank tea, we
talked about our hopes and dreams.

23:29.634 --> 23:31.539
You know, at one point
Karen played the violin

23:31.564 --> 23:33.031
and we all danced like gypsies.

23:33.057 --> 23:34.848
Or I could be lying. Ooh, hang on.

23:35.122 --> 23:37.769
Just one minute.
I've got something for you.

23:37.794 --> 23:39.203
Not in front of the nurses.

23:49.885 --> 23:53.342
OK, do you know how long
I have worked here, hm?

23:53.368 --> 23:55.589
Not as much as a bloody card,
and you've been here, what?

23:55.614 --> 23:58.233
Four months, and you get
a box of chocolates.

24:00.373 --> 24:01.596
Who's it from?

24:01.677 --> 24:03.696
- Just a patient.
- Ah, good.

24:06.796 --> 24:08.345
I can't stand the coffee ones.

24:10.748 --> 24:12.323
That one. Thank you.

24:16.004 --> 24:17.959
So when were you planning on telling me?

24:20.183 --> 24:21.492
Telling you what?

24:21.803 --> 24:22.997
About you...

24:25.704 --> 24:27.583
..and Dr Perfect.

24:28.328 --> 24:30.503
Of course, you should have
checked with me first.

24:30.877 --> 24:33.292
I don't know what you're talking about.

24:33.426 --> 24:35.625
No matter how little
I know about medicine,

24:35.651 --> 24:38.028
I can spot the signs of a workplace
shagging at 50 paces.

24:38.256 --> 24:39.530
Is it serious?

24:40.701 --> 24:42.731
I'll take that as a yes.

24:42.757 --> 24:45.391
Oh-ho-ho! Well, don't worry. I approve.

24:45.854 --> 24:47.059
He's one of the good ones.

24:47.084 --> 24:49.359
And he deserves better
than that stuck-up cow Sarah.

24:49.384 --> 24:50.724
Just don't tell anyone.

24:50.750 --> 24:52.153
Not yet at least.

24:52.226 --> 24:53.791
I knew it!

24:53.973 --> 24:55.444
It's early days, but...

24:55.678 --> 24:58.869
Don't worry. Your secret,
unlike your chocolates, is safe.

24:58.894 --> 25:02.444
But seriously, I think
it's great. Really.

25:02.470 --> 25:06.068
OK, well, I have extracted
the chosen few.

25:06.504 --> 25:09.554
And the rest is
suitable for general consumption.

25:10.165 --> 25:11.315
Thank you.

25:12.101 --> 25:15.497
Oh, next weekend,
the Glasgow CEM conference?

25:15.523 --> 25:18.060
Well, as long as you can tear
yourself off from lover boy.

25:18.293 --> 25:19.808
I think I'm on next weekend.

25:19.966 --> 25:23.551
No, um, I decided your continued
professional development took

25:23.577 --> 25:25.286
priority. Mohammed's on instead.

25:25.536 --> 25:26.719
Doesn't he mind?

25:26.744 --> 25:29.338
Well, when it's this or your old job
in Syria, you tend to be flexible.

25:29.364 --> 25:31.128
Still, I don't know if I can.

25:31.229 --> 25:33.215
Well, when's your appraisal due?

25:33.434 --> 25:35.978
- I dunno, but...
- Right, you know what they're like.

25:36.004 --> 25:38.509
Evidence of continuing
professional development.

25:38.535 --> 25:40.530
I can't sign you off until you attend.

25:40.556 --> 25:43.067
Sorry, it's just with childcare
and everything.

25:43.083 --> 25:43.829
Mm-hm.

25:43.854 --> 25:46.309
And do you want Alex on your back
about your appraisal as well

25:46.334 --> 25:47.618
as your passport?

25:47.745 --> 25:50.234
I get it. It's just really tricky.

25:51.165 --> 25:54.087
Look, if it's me, just say.

25:54.373 --> 25:56.684
I can take it. I'm a big girl.

25:57.512 --> 25:58.961
I know I can be full on.

25:59.737 --> 26:01.152
I just thought it'd be fun.

26:01.178 --> 26:03.212
It's not that. Really, I'd
ove to go. It's just...

26:03.238 --> 26:05.415
Good! It's settled then.

26:05.960 --> 26:09.215
And I refuse to spend a dull
night in Glasgow being

26:09.241 --> 26:10.906
lectured about exit block.

26:10.932 --> 26:12.621
You're now my official wing woman.

26:20.901 --> 26:22.212
Cath!

26:26.101 --> 26:27.151
Cath!

26:27.177 --> 26:28.892
You're a tough woman to find.

26:29.232 --> 26:30.847
I don't want to talk to you.

26:30.873 --> 26:33.658
The thing is, I've got a proposal.
Bit of cash in it too.

26:33.684 --> 26:35.019
Twisted the editor's arm.

26:35.044 --> 26:36.405
But we want to widen things out.

26:36.431 --> 26:38.367
Healthcare in Sheffield,
the big scandal.

26:40.674 --> 26:42.750
- Sorry.
- No, hold on.

26:42.846 --> 26:44.465
Ten minutes of your time, that's all.

26:44.491 --> 26:47.003
- No, I'm working.
- I came all this way. Please.

26:54.525 --> 26:55.860
OK.

26:58.204 --> 27:00.189
- I checked all the usual places.
- There's nothing.

27:00.214 --> 27:02.553
It's like you just vanished.
That's none of your business.

27:02.579 --> 27:05.259
Look, you came to me with this.
Your story.

27:05.284 --> 27:07.599
When Karl mentioned you wanted
to talk to someone,

27:07.624 --> 27:09.128
I was, you know, whatever, worth a look.

27:09.154 --> 27:10.723
But it got to me. You got to me.

27:11.098 --> 27:14.073
Look, the government keep on with
all this "our NHS" bullshit,

27:14.098 --> 27:16.513
but you dig a bit,
and it's falling to pieces.

27:16.538 --> 27:18.864
Patients suffering,
good people getting shafted.

27:18.890 --> 27:20.484
Exactly what you told me.

27:20.654 --> 27:22.850
My boss wants me to follow this up.

27:26.179 --> 27:28.819
Look, I want people to know
and I thought you did too.

27:35.280 --> 27:37.365
You still see him? Karl?

27:37.391 --> 27:39.217
Now and again. Five-a-side, that's it.

27:41.098 --> 27:44.593
I just wanted what was best for my
daughter. The situation wasn't ideal.

27:44.618 --> 27:46.703
- OK.
- He'd let her down.

27:46.728 --> 27:50.123
Not just once or twice,
but time and time and time again.

27:50.148 --> 27:53.313
She'd wait, get excited,
and then he'd just not turn up,

27:53.338 --> 27:55.234
or give some shit excuse.

27:55.555 --> 27:57.590
I thought some distance
was what we needed.

27:57.616 --> 27:58.995
So how's that working?

27:59.193 --> 28:00.903
We go down there, it's easier.

28:00.929 --> 28:03.203
And then there's the money thing.
I'm earning and he's not.

28:03.228 --> 28:05.873
Look, I get it. Still, I don't see
why that means you can't help me.

28:05.898 --> 28:08.633
I just don't want to get involved,
that's all.

28:08.658 --> 28:11.521
I want this to be a fresh
start for both of us.

28:13.714 --> 28:15.692
Karl has no idea where you are, does he?

28:21.066 --> 28:22.517
Why are you hiding from him?

28:24.247 --> 28:25.548
It got...

28:28.700 --> 28:30.511
Did he hit you, or her?

28:33.345 --> 28:34.374
Bastard.

28:35.209 --> 28:38.588
I need this whole thing
to be a new start for us.

28:38.614 --> 28:41.749
I don't care about me. I
care about my daughter.

28:41.775 --> 28:44.314
Shit, look, it's OK.
I get it, I'm sorry.

28:44.638 --> 28:46.128
I should never have come here.

28:46.154 --> 28:47.503
I can make this work without you.

28:47.528 --> 28:49.563
I don't know how,
but I'll sort something.

28:49.588 --> 28:51.330
You won't hear from me again.

29:24.418 --> 29:26.173
I trust my staff 100%.

29:26.198 --> 29:27.582
There must be a mistake.

29:29.915 --> 29:31.290
Everything OK?

29:31.400 --> 29:32.586
Yeah.

29:33.670 --> 29:35.883
That looked a bit intense outside.

29:35.908 --> 29:37.436
I thought I was going
to have to jump in.

29:37.828 --> 29:39.963
- Friend of yours?
- Oh, it's nothing. It's fine.

29:39.988 --> 29:41.883
It's just an estate agent.

29:41.908 --> 29:43.473
Couldn't get hold of me

29:43.498 --> 29:45.326
and wanted to talk about
some property on the market.

29:45.352 --> 29:47.027
About time you went up in the world.

29:47.085 --> 29:48.541
Buying or renting?

29:49.130 --> 29:50.555
I'm not sure.

29:50.581 --> 29:53.637
You know, I love to see my valued
colleagues putting down roots.

29:54.031 --> 29:57.376
And making friends. So where are
you looking? Somewhere nice?

29:57.402 --> 29:58.737
Hm, not on what we pay her.

29:58.763 --> 30:01.053
Well, a few night shifts
and Edinburgh's your oyster.

30:01.078 --> 30:03.213
I'm just looking, that's all.
See what's out there.

30:05.468 --> 30:06.487
Hello?

30:08.386 --> 30:09.951
Cardiac arrest in five.

30:09.977 --> 30:11.348
I'll take it.

30:12.278 --> 30:15.633
Unknown male, IVDU,

30:15.658 --> 30:18.179
with pinpoint pupils,
in respiratory arrest.

30:18.205 --> 30:20.083
Scoop and run from Gould Street.

30:20.108 --> 30:22.193
- Early 50s.
- How long's he been down?

30:22.218 --> 30:23.693
Medically, about ten minutes.

30:23.718 --> 30:25.763
Emotionally, I'd say 30 years minimum.

30:25.788 --> 30:27.187
And...

30:28.868 --> 30:30.087
Stop CPR.

30:35.793 --> 30:38.450
OK, so he's got a pulse.
Hold CPR. Keep bagging him.

30:38.476 --> 30:39.849
Someone check a BP.

30:40.277 --> 30:41.277
Access?

30:41.303 --> 30:44.080
Sorry. Well, your man
didn't exactly make it easy for us.

30:44.460 --> 30:46.039
His veins have collapsed.

30:46.274 --> 30:47.661
There's no way in.

31:00.104 --> 31:01.273
I can do it.

31:02.751 --> 31:04.110
He's completely shut down.

31:07.548 --> 31:08.787
Pink, please.

31:08.986 --> 31:11.441
Get some naloxone ready. IM and IV.

31:11.467 --> 31:12.987
I'd pay to see this.

31:15.020 --> 31:16.519
Right, where are you?

31:19.533 --> 31:20.892
Where are you?

31:51.810 --> 31:53.259
OK, naloxone?

31:56.603 --> 31:57.675
In.

31:58.157 --> 32:00.033
Give him an IM before he wakes up.

32:00.058 --> 32:01.132
Way ahead of you.

32:01.158 --> 32:04.273
- How did you do that?
- Ah, practice.

32:04.299 --> 32:07.165
- And a little light sadism.
- Ah, you've better eyes than me.

32:09.132 --> 32:10.346
Security!

32:10.848 --> 32:12.591
I'll get him.

32:13.390 --> 32:14.596
Get off!

32:16.471 --> 32:17.600
Bitch!

32:50.572 --> 32:52.137
One, two, three!

32:53.408 --> 32:55.548
Ah! Ah! Ah!

32:58.472 --> 33:00.468
Seriously, eh? Be careful.

33:00.872 --> 33:03.357
It's an educational
conference, not Magaluf.

33:03.504 --> 33:05.103
I don't even want to go.

33:05.128 --> 33:07.784
I don't blame you. I've heard
a lot of hair gets let down.

33:07.848 --> 33:09.003
So come with me.

33:09.029 --> 33:11.433
Or, better still, you go with
Bridge and get me out of it.

33:11.458 --> 33:13.416
I can't. I've got a mate
coming up from Leeds.

33:13.462 --> 33:14.797
Mike Watkins?

33:15.429 --> 33:16.764
No, don't think I know him.

33:16.790 --> 33:18.883
I went to school with him
but he moved to Leeds.

33:18.908 --> 33:20.458
Must've been in your day, no?

33:20.707 --> 33:22.613
Maybe, don't ring a bell, though.

33:22.639 --> 33:25.692
Knowing Mike, I would've expected him
to have hit on you at least once.

33:26.318 --> 33:27.959
What can I say? So many men.

33:27.985 --> 33:29.737
So little time.

33:29.763 --> 33:32.202
Anyway, I know better than
to crash a girls' night out.

33:33.392 --> 33:34.993
Brigitte said you'd be jealous.

33:35.488 --> 33:37.116
- She knows about us?
- She guessed

33:37.142 --> 33:38.743
and I told her to keep it to herself.

33:38.768 --> 33:40.797
Which means we may as well hire
one of those biplanes

33:40.823 --> 33:43.086
and stream it from a bloody banner.

33:43.994 --> 33:46.763
- You know what, maybe it's not a problem.
- It's fine, I trust her.

33:47.768 --> 33:49.004
Hmm.

33:49.178 --> 33:50.728
So you used to play down here?

33:50.754 --> 33:52.089
Every day.

33:52.318 --> 33:55.393
Me and Craig Johnstone built
a machine-gun nest right there.

33:55.418 --> 33:57.240
Took out a lot of Nazis.

33:58.038 --> 33:59.445
Well, this is my home.

33:59.800 --> 34:02.940
Look around you.
Why would I give this up?

34:03.947 --> 34:06.040
- Simple.
- I think so.

34:06.898 --> 34:10.063
Sarah talked about moving,
I just never really saw the point.

34:10.088 --> 34:11.897
Did you talk to your solicitor again?

34:12.058 --> 34:13.672
For all the good it did.

34:13.697 --> 34:14.817
Honestly, it's...

34:16.228 --> 34:18.123
It's the worst thing that's
ever happened to me.

34:18.148 --> 34:21.152
It's like we're both paying
lawyers to make us miserable.

34:22.318 --> 34:24.263
Now she's fighting for
access at weekends.

34:24.288 --> 34:25.953
I have to be flexible because of work

34:25.978 --> 34:28.416
and she's using that against me.
I'm basically...

34:29.308 --> 34:31.533
I'm basically shot from both sides.

34:31.558 --> 34:32.943
Ellie's hurt herself!

34:32.967 --> 34:35.215
Oh, quick, trauma call!

34:36.288 --> 34:38.612
I need some help here.
Call Dr Mummy for me.

34:38.638 --> 34:40.112
Look, Mummy.

34:40.138 --> 34:41.193
What's happened?

34:41.217 --> 34:43.342
Significant head injury. Unresponsive.

34:43.368 --> 34:44.753
Pupils fixed and dilated.

34:44.777 --> 34:46.773
Oh, sounds like she needs a cuddle!

34:46.797 --> 34:48.985
Roger that. Call the cuddle team.

34:49.011 --> 34:50.306
Cuddle, cuddle.

34:50.547 --> 34:52.163
Aw! Hey-hey!

34:52.188 --> 34:53.983
- All better.
- There we go.

34:54.007 --> 34:55.054
Pop her in.

34:57.360 --> 34:58.544
You know...

34:59.168 --> 35:02.193
you don't actually
need to buy somewhere.

35:02.218 --> 35:04.905
I've got a flat. It's practically empty.

35:05.688 --> 35:06.833
You don't know me.

35:06.858 --> 35:08.993
Look, I'm not asking for your
hand in marriage here.

35:09.018 --> 35:10.924
We could just see how it goes.

35:12.018 --> 35:13.575
Why, cos it's convenient?

35:13.602 --> 35:16.437
Sex on tap?
You'd cut down on your travel time.

35:16.658 --> 35:19.113
OK, now I'm just confused.
It was a serious offer.

35:19.138 --> 35:21.028
- If you don't want to...
- I just think it's too soon.

35:21.054 --> 35:22.339
That's anecdotal.

35:22.468 --> 35:24.503
Conventional wisdom that's
never been tested.

35:24.528 --> 35:27.393
There is not optimal relationship
time before commencing cohabitation.

35:27.419 --> 35:28.837
- Don't do this.
- What?

35:29.168 --> 35:31.153
Push me into a corner. It's not fair.

35:34.415 --> 35:36.450
OK. Fine.

35:36.577 --> 35:39.311
Too soon. I retract the offer.

35:40.513 --> 35:42.743
As we were, OK?

35:42.768 --> 35:43.747
OK.

35:46.798 --> 35:49.248
- Mummy!
- Coming.

35:53.648 --> 35:55.876
You be a good girl. Mwah!

35:55.981 --> 35:57.071
OK?

35:57.818 --> 36:00.743
Don't say it. We'll be fine.

36:00.768 --> 36:01.997
You deserve it.

36:02.023 --> 36:04.222
Thank you. I mean, it's mostly lectures.

36:05.285 --> 36:07.145
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

36:07.715 --> 36:08.771
Yeah.

36:17.078 --> 36:18.537
- Hey.
- Hi.

36:23.648 --> 36:26.013
Hey.

36:26.038 --> 36:27.487
Oh. Sorry.

36:30.818 --> 36:32.592
- Hello?
- <i>Yeah, I can do it.</i>

36:32.992 --> 36:34.137
<i>£800.</i>

36:34.163 --> 36:36.257
OK, thanks. Bye.

36:38.318 --> 36:40.865
- Everything OK?
- Yeah, just my ex.

36:41.178 --> 36:42.871
Just something we need to sort.

36:43.478 --> 36:47.507
OK, well, let the education commence.

37:33.825 --> 37:35.250
What is it we're going to go and see?

37:35.275 --> 37:37.574
What are we going to see first?
Let's see, AF.

37:49.915 --> 37:51.150
What do you want me to do?

37:51.175 --> 37:52.548
Go call a doctor.

38:03.315 --> 38:04.550
Have you seen Ally?

38:04.575 --> 38:07.040
In Glasgow on some
kind of jolly with Brigitte.

38:12.119 --> 38:13.214
Hi.

38:13.997 --> 38:15.043
Sure.

38:16.048 --> 38:17.663
Yeah, I'll call you later.

38:17.689 --> 38:18.628
Bye.

38:25.205 --> 38:26.400
So you're a horror fan.

38:26.425 --> 38:28.930
Mm. The bloodier the better.
Ever wonder why I work here?

38:28.955 --> 38:30.978
OK...

38:31.612 --> 38:34.931
scariest baddie ever, on three.

38:35.195 --> 38:36.290
One, two...

38:36.315 --> 38:37.674
Freddy Krueger.

38:39.561 --> 38:43.124
I was, like, ten and my brother
had the DVD. Shat my pants.

38:43.305 --> 38:45.849
Didn't sleep for, like, a week
afterwards, man.

38:46.215 --> 38:47.648
Not any more, right?

38:47.910 --> 38:50.158
Oh, I sleep fine now, thanks.

38:50.665 --> 38:52.233
Still shit my pants, though.

38:55.519 --> 38:58.280
There's actually a screening
Tuesday night near the Grassmarket,

38:58.305 --> 39:00.530
one of those dress-up things,
if you fancy it.

39:00.555 --> 39:02.252
Mm, I think I'm working.

39:04.345 --> 39:05.730
Och, don't worry about it.

39:05.755 --> 39:08.061
No, I'm on days. Cool, let's do it.

39:10.206 --> 39:11.588
OK, great.

39:11.995 --> 39:13.114
Great.

39:15.225 --> 39:19.140
AF is a challenge we all face every day.

39:19.165 --> 39:21.580
But which treatment is the right one?

39:21.605 --> 39:22.926
Girlie swot.

39:23.285 --> 39:24.860
What? It's interesting.

39:24.885 --> 39:26.170
It's AF.

39:26.195 --> 39:27.530
No-one finds AF interesting,

39:27.555 --> 39:29.647
even the people who
have got it are bored.

39:31.445 --> 39:35.550
..one-size-fits-all approach
to this complex condition...

39:36.438 --> 39:39.770
Don't worry, Dr Perfect
would be proud of you.

39:46.572 --> 39:48.097
Do you want to get out of here?

39:48.192 --> 39:49.897
There's too many doctors.

39:50.055 --> 39:51.300
Drink?

39:51.325 --> 39:52.724
Oh, yes.

40:02.625 --> 40:04.440
- Good to see you, pal.
- You too, mate.

40:04.552 --> 40:06.827
What you want to do? Pub or coffee?

40:06.853 --> 40:08.582
Are you seriously asking me?

40:08.801 --> 40:10.890
- Coffee then, eh?
- Aye!

40:10.915 --> 40:12.744
Let's get a pint, man. Aye.

40:12.785 --> 40:15.512
Aye, so there's Cliff on
long-term sick leave.

40:15.538 --> 40:16.570
- Sorry.
- Mm.

40:16.595 --> 40:17.997
Anxiety, depression.

40:18.465 --> 40:19.990
Signed off for another six months.

40:20.015 --> 40:22.209
Advertise it.
Backs and brains never return.

40:22.235 --> 40:23.220
Mm.

40:23.245 --> 40:26.930
Got a couple of good ones, though.
Do you know Alison Sutton?

40:26.955 --> 40:28.330
Staff grade. Sheffield way.

40:28.355 --> 40:29.640
- Mm.
- I went to uni with her.

40:29.665 --> 40:31.997
Yeah, she's just moved up.
Needed a change of scene.

40:32.023 --> 40:35.180
Really? I heard she went to New
Zealand, married some farmer type.

40:36.113 --> 40:38.270
Well, if she did, she kept that quiet.

40:38.855 --> 40:40.844
She's smart. She's, erm...

40:42.070 --> 40:43.500
Yeah, she works hard.

40:43.936 --> 40:45.484
Teacher's pet.

40:46.735 --> 40:49.660
Careful. Work and play never ends well.

40:49.685 --> 40:50.872
- It's fine.
- Mm.

40:51.895 --> 40:54.580
Always is - till the shit hits the fan.

40:54.870 --> 40:57.549
Your funeral. My round, I think.

41:05.625 --> 41:06.794
OK...

41:08.145 --> 41:11.090
..most embarrassing shag
you've ever had.

41:11.115 --> 41:12.184
Oh, God!

41:14.513 --> 41:16.594
OK, I will start.

41:19.685 --> 41:21.820
Erm... he was 64.

41:21.846 --> 41:23.023
- 60?
- Yeah, he was

41:23.049 --> 41:24.641
a cardiologist from the Brompton.

41:24.895 --> 41:27.210
And he was the double of Robert Redford.

41:27.235 --> 41:31.100
And I was hoping for this whole
Indecent Proposal vibe.

41:31.125 --> 41:34.100
- Was he rich?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, big private practice.

41:34.125 --> 41:35.334
Huge.

41:36.375 --> 41:39.350
See, you can think it,
but I never said it.

41:39.375 --> 41:42.466
So, anyway, erm, we did it and...

41:42.579 --> 41:43.684
and it was fine.

41:43.834 --> 41:46.709
I mean, a bit Viagra-assisted
but basically it was fine.

41:46.735 --> 41:48.374
And we were lying there and...

41:50.221 --> 41:51.257
He said...

41:51.283 --> 41:52.710
Oh, God, he didn't tell
you that he loved you?

41:52.735 --> 41:54.030
Oh, no, worse.

41:54.374 --> 41:56.930
He said that I reminded him
of his daughter.

41:56.955 --> 41:59.700
Oh!

41:59.725 --> 42:01.084
Are you kidding?

42:04.683 --> 42:06.881
OK, your turn.

42:06.995 --> 42:08.090
Oh, sorry, I can't compete.

42:08.115 --> 42:10.782
Not even close. His daughter?

42:12.385 --> 42:16.916
OK, let's be positive, the best
guy ever, the whole package.

42:17.165 --> 42:18.201
Er...

42:18.227 --> 42:19.415
I don't know.

42:19.881 --> 42:22.194
- Honestly, I...
- Well, think back.

42:22.785 --> 42:24.120
I can wait all day.

42:24.145 --> 42:25.712
What time does this place close?

42:30.715 --> 42:32.111
Er, OK.

42:33.170 --> 42:34.675
His name was Grant,

42:34.891 --> 42:37.890
he's from New Zealand, he's a farmer.

42:38.205 --> 42:39.511
Friend of a friend.

42:43.495 --> 42:46.250
Oh, I don't really know what to say.
He was just a really lovely guy.

42:46.275 --> 42:47.565
So what happened?

42:48.055 --> 42:49.200
He went home.

42:49.225 --> 42:50.776
What and you didn't go with him?

42:50.891 --> 42:51.945
No.

42:52.365 --> 42:53.864
Here I am.

42:57.805 --> 43:00.797
Do you know what I think? I think
that's a load of bollocks.

43:01.156 --> 43:02.618
Bridge. You know, I...

43:03.072 --> 43:05.376
I don't mind if you don't
want tell me but...

43:06.105 --> 43:07.474
I mean, don't lie.

43:08.779 --> 43:10.232
Why would I make it up?

43:10.258 --> 43:12.309
I don't know, maybe you don't trust me.

43:12.335 --> 43:14.495
I mean, I had to get that whole
Andy thing out of you with...

43:14.666 --> 43:16.124
with thumbscrews.

43:16.150 --> 43:17.890
It wasn't like
that, I just didn't want to jinx it.

43:17.915 --> 43:20.214
No, I understand,
some things are personal.

43:24.460 --> 43:26.492
Actually, I needed your advice.

43:27.037 --> 43:28.803
Andy asked me to move in with him.

43:29.215 --> 43:30.600
Shit, what did you say?

43:30.625 --> 43:31.945
It's too soon.

43:31.971 --> 43:33.000
And?

43:34.095 --> 43:36.272
Then he told me I reminded
him of his daughter.

43:38.775 --> 43:40.698
OK, for that you drink.

44:03.569 --> 44:06.411
On me. I'm sorry about that.

44:06.905 --> 44:08.240
Even though it was ball first.

44:08.265 --> 44:09.658
Was it bollocks.

44:11.215 --> 44:13.730
I thought the whole point
of footie was the rehydration.

44:13.755 --> 44:15.790
Unless that's all creme de menthe.

44:15.815 --> 44:17.900
Erm, lime and soda.

44:18.403 --> 44:19.598
On the wagon.

44:19.795 --> 44:21.844
Six months. Never felt better.

44:22.448 --> 44:25.400
Fitness is off the scale,
even doing Giggsy's yoga tape.

44:25.425 --> 44:26.824
Oh!

44:27.801 --> 44:29.136
You should try it.

44:29.286 --> 44:31.853
Seriously. Whole new start.

44:32.586 --> 44:33.921
Wish I'd have done it years ago.

44:33.947 --> 44:35.255
Well, good for you.

44:35.921 --> 44:37.597
I've really screwed things up.

44:38.662 --> 44:39.924
I get that now.

44:40.705 --> 44:42.600
Never know what you've
got till it's gone.

44:42.625 --> 44:43.704
Right?

44:45.815 --> 44:48.081
- You got any kids?
- Not that I know about.

44:49.145 --> 44:51.736
- Changes everything.
- Right.

44:52.705 --> 44:54.610
Look, sorry, there's
somewhere I need to be.

44:56.321 --> 44:57.795
Have we got a problem?

44:58.801 --> 45:00.956
- I know I went in a bit hard but...
- So I hear.

45:01.481 --> 45:04.970
Don't worry, I can take it. It's
the others you want to apologise to.

45:18.351 --> 45:20.016
Once a year.

45:20.041 --> 45:21.294
Shoot me.

45:23.371 --> 45:24.678
You know,

45:24.871 --> 45:26.716
I've never asked you how many.

45:26.741 --> 45:29.156
I don't really want to talk about men.

45:29.181 --> 45:30.846
Oh, Christ, not that.

45:30.871 --> 45:32.359
I mean the big question.

45:33.351 --> 45:34.786
How many have you killed?

45:34.811 --> 45:36.583
And don't you dare say no-one.

45:38.739 --> 45:40.848
OK, here's my list.

45:41.131 --> 45:43.406
Last five years edited highlights.

45:43.431 --> 45:47.109
One aortic dissection. 52.

45:47.242 --> 45:50.267
Told him it was indigestion.
He bled out on the way home.

45:50.293 --> 45:53.128
Two ischaemic bowels.

45:53.371 --> 45:54.566
One of them was just about

45:54.591 --> 45:56.576
to celebrate her golden
wedding anniversary.

45:56.601 --> 45:58.036
Never learned that lesson.

45:58.061 --> 46:00.566
And then there was that wee girl.

46:00.591 --> 46:01.926
You don't have to tell me.

46:01.951 --> 46:03.258
No, yes, I do.

46:04.283 --> 46:07.333
Because I can't tell anyone else,
and neither can you.

46:14.511 --> 46:15.590
She was four.

46:17.231 --> 46:18.564
It was late, I...

46:18.768 --> 46:22.399
I was tired, if that's ever
an excuse and...

46:23.231 --> 46:26.154
I'd been on all night and
then back nine hours and...

46:26.701 --> 46:29.726
the stupid thing is I knew she was sick.

46:30.401 --> 46:32.330
Just got that feeling
that you get and...

46:33.591 --> 46:36.803
..but I heard myself telling
the parents the same old lines,

46:37.441 --> 46:41.584
you know, "Just give it a day
or two, regular paracetamol."

46:43.319 --> 46:45.042
Because I wanted to go home.

46:46.161 --> 46:49.195
I didn't want the bother
of referring her, taking bloods.

46:56.586 --> 46:57.957
That's all.

46:58.541 --> 46:59.956
What happened?

47:02.157 --> 47:03.746
She came back that night.

47:05.141 --> 47:07.179
Meningococcal sepsis.

47:08.611 --> 47:10.971
They took both her arms
to stop it but...

47:12.311 --> 47:13.892
..she died anyway.

47:14.851 --> 47:16.762
Good thing really, poor wee soul.

47:17.831 --> 47:18.974
Then what happened?

47:19.373 --> 47:20.674
Nothing.

47:21.460 --> 47:22.939
Nothing happened at all.

47:23.751 --> 47:26.020
You know, the parents
never even made a complaint.

47:26.571 --> 47:29.582
God knows why. You know, I think
that was the worst thing.

47:30.601 --> 47:33.930
That I got away with it scot-free.

47:41.801 --> 47:42.930
What about you?

47:45.651 --> 47:46.770
None.

47:48.321 --> 47:49.919
I mean, none I can think of.

47:52.491 --> 47:54.311
I mean, maybe, I don't even know.

47:54.931 --> 47:56.010
Give it time.

47:58.721 --> 48:00.040
I need another drink.

48:27.511 --> 48:28.796
How was it?

48:28.821 --> 48:31.486
- It was good.
- Hey, we had a great time.

48:31.512 --> 48:34.046
Learnt a lot about AF,
our favourite subject.

48:34.071 --> 48:36.246
Apparently, we should be
using beta-blockers.

48:36.271 --> 48:37.271
Brigitte.

48:37.452 --> 48:39.208
Got one of your regulars.

48:39.839 --> 48:41.118
Oh, shit.

48:43.871 --> 48:45.982
Don't worry, I wouldn't tell me either.

48:46.789 --> 48:48.738
Oh, hey, I saw Mike Watkins.

48:50.137 --> 48:51.192
How is he?

48:51.421 --> 48:52.616
Yeah, he's good.

48:52.641 --> 48:53.966
Apart from the job, obviously.

48:53.991 --> 48:55.158
Obviously.

48:55.288 --> 48:56.713
He doesn't remember you.

48:59.711 --> 49:01.883
Well, then I definitely
didn't sleep with him.

49:02.293 --> 49:04.236
Ally, that X-ray's back.

49:04.261 --> 49:05.302
OK.

49:25.582 --> 49:27.107
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hi.

49:27.679 --> 49:29.161
Is it ready?

49:53.201 --> 49:54.330
Hi.

50:22.461 --> 50:25.550
- You all right?
- Aye. Doing away, doing away.

50:48.309 --> 50:50.147
How come you look OK in that?

50:53.441 --> 50:55.270
I look like a serial killer in mine.

50:57.101 --> 50:59.606
Thanks. I'll copy it
and give it back, OK?

50:59.631 --> 51:00.760
No problem.

51:09.801 --> 51:12.240
- Rrrgh!
- Oh, my God!

51:13.848 --> 51:14.977
Hey.

51:17.478 --> 51:20.326
- Oh, they're going to find out soon enough.
- Because it makes me feel uncomfortable.

51:20.351 --> 51:21.686
Well, if Brigitte knows, then...

51:21.711 --> 51:23.566
Yeah, it doesn't mean
we have to broadcast it.

51:23.591 --> 51:25.576
What, so we're just going
to stay secret forever,

51:25.601 --> 51:26.796
like Romeo and Juliet?

51:26.821 --> 51:28.295
Well, that ended well, didn't it?

51:28.320 --> 51:30.445
I just think the fewer people
that know the better.

51:30.470 --> 51:32.010
I don't like everyone
knowing my business.

51:32.036 --> 51:33.577
I think you are ashamed of me.

51:33.603 --> 51:36.635
Maybe I just want to keep you to myself.

51:40.790 --> 51:43.715
So, did you ask her?

51:43.740 --> 51:46.155
- What's this?
- Charlie and Karen.

51:46.180 --> 51:48.857
Really?

51:48.883 --> 51:51.488
We're going to see Nightmare
On Elm Street. They're screening it.

51:51.534 --> 51:53.745
- It's not a date.
- It sounds like a date.

51:53.770 --> 51:55.509
It definitely sounds like a date.

52:06.200 --> 52:09.429
Mummy!

52:30.168 --> 52:31.295
Hello?

52:31.700 --> 52:35.465
<i>Sorry to bother you. This is Sharon
from the Ivy Grove Care Home.</i>

52:35.490 --> 52:37.255
Can I speak to Ms Hardacre, please?

52:37.280 --> 52:38.211
Sorry?

52:38.237 --> 52:40.443
<i>Is it possible to speak to Cath, please?</i>

52:41.350 --> 52:43.104
- Who?
- I'll take it.

52:46.040 --> 52:48.548
Yeah, I'll come immediately. OK.

52:51.480 --> 52:53.755
- Everything OK?
- My dad's ill.

52:53.780 --> 52:56.094
He's on his way to hospital.
The ambulance just left.

52:56.500 --> 52:59.195
- I need to go.
- It sounded like a wrong number.

52:59.220 --> 53:01.708
Well, she's new, got the name
mixed up. I don't know.

53:01.890 --> 53:03.752
- Come here.
- There you go.

53:04.040 --> 53:05.195
I'll come with you.

53:05.220 --> 53:08.822
No, no, it's fine. Can you let work
know? I might need a day or two.

53:10.369 --> 53:11.546
Sure.

54:00.150 --> 54:02.451
_

54:07.599 --> 54:11.246
_

54:32.130 --> 54:34.125
What do you think of her - Ally?

54:34.150 --> 54:35.385
Has there been a problem?

54:35.410 --> 54:39.045
I just wanted to chase up
the reference, a Dr Alison Sutton.

54:39.070 --> 54:40.405
She worked for you.

54:40.430 --> 54:42.085
I've been taking care of your father.

54:42.110 --> 54:44.995
His lungs sound congested, when was
the last time he had a chest X-ray?

54:45.020 --> 54:47.295
Perhaps it would be best
if we stepped outside.

54:47.320 --> 54:48.701
Hey.

54:48.910 --> 54:50.793
Did she say something to you about me?

54:51.136 --> 54:54.514
I want to take you somewhere,
just you, me and Molly.

54:54.910 --> 54:56.385
Why are we even here?

54:56.410 --> 54:59.245
I think we need to be honest
with each other, don't you?

54:59.270 --> 55:00.439
Talk to me.
