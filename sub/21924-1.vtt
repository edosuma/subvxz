Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.770 --> 00:03.875
Face it. You can't bring yourself
to go to a wedding with me

00:03.942 --> 00:06.051
- if Peter's gonna be there.
- That is not true.

00:06.878 --> 00:09.021
Caleb, where's Amy? Where's Ty?

00:09.055 --> 00:10.955
- Amy's having the baby.
- What?!

00:10.990 --> 00:12.691
- Come on, come on, come on!
- 'Kay, I'm coming!

00:12.726 --> 00:14.224
- What about the wedding?
- Forget the wedding!

00:14.260 --> 00:15.827
Okay, okay, we're going!

00:22.969 --> 00:25.969
- It's a girl, Amy.
- Oh, she's beautiful.

00:26.004 --> 00:28.172
- Yeah, she is.
- Hey... Oh...

00:28.207 --> 00:30.007
She's perfect.

Whoa...

01:45.680 --> 01:47.311
Easy...

01:47.347 --> 01:48.347
Whoa!

01:48.935 --> 01:50.314
Flame!

01:53.087 --> 01:54.218
Flame!

02:21.556 --> 02:23.445
Tastes good, right? Yeah.

02:23.481 --> 02:26.515
Really good.

02:26.551 --> 02:29.519
Look at you eating it all up! Good job!

02:30.402 --> 02:31.187
How was your ride?

02:31.223 --> 02:33.223
Excellent. It cleared out the cobwebs.

02:33.258 --> 02:35.025
- I actually feel awake.
- Oh, good.

02:35.061 --> 02:37.061
Hey,
I got a call from your mom last night.

02:37.096 --> 02:38.326
Oh... shoot.

02:38.361 --> 02:40.128
Muah! Yeah,
she's trying to get a hold of you two.

02:40.164 --> 02:42.463
Yeah, I was supposed to call her back.

02:42.500 --> 02:45.533
- Call her back about what?
- Well, she's been texting me.

02:45.569 --> 02:47.269
- Why?
- Ty, you know why.

02:47.305 --> 02:49.538
She wants come see her granddaughter,

02:49.574 --> 02:51.139
and I can't keep making excuses.

02:51.175 --> 02:53.141
And she's losing her patience.

02:53.177 --> 02:55.276
I really don't like being
the go-between here.

02:55.312 --> 02:57.812
Can we just invite her?
Of course she wants to see Lyndy.

02:57.848 --> 03:00.014
Amy, now is not a good time.

03:00.050 --> 03:01.216
We're in the middle of sleep training,

03:01.251 --> 03:02.818
we're introducing pureed baby foods...

03:02.853 --> 03:04.819
I only have a week left
before I have to go back

03:04.854 --> 03:06.054
to work at the clinic. I...

03:06.090 --> 03:07.823
It's about time you got back to work.

03:07.858 --> 03:10.625
You're lucky Scott's held that
position for you all this time.

03:10.659 --> 03:11.925
Hi!

03:11.961 --> 03:13.728
Hi. Have you gone to the dealership

03:13.763 --> 03:15.795
to talk to the guy about that truck?

03:15.831 --> 03:18.264
Uh, no, I've been kind of busy.

03:18.300 --> 03:21.602
Ty, you can't put a baby seat
in that old classic of yours.

03:21.637 --> 03:24.805
Amy needs a dependable vehicle
for when you go back to work.

03:24.841 --> 03:27.942
Yup, he's right. You need a new truck.

03:27.977 --> 03:29.574
I've been using Lou's SUV

03:29.610 --> 03:31.509
while she and Katie are in New York.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.379
And besides, if I'm in a bind,
I can use yours, Dad.

03:34.414 --> 03:36.949
No, that's too temporary,
and it's not convenient.

03:36.985 --> 03:38.651
Okay, we will buy a new truck.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.753
Eventually! Eventually.

03:40.788 --> 03:44.623
What are they feeding you? What is that?

03:44.658 --> 03:47.259
It's spinach, broccoli and banana.

03:47.293 --> 03:49.426
- Do you want some?
- No! That looks awful.

03:49.462 --> 03:51.864
Morning! Hi, Lyndy!

03:51.899 --> 03:53.497
Awful...

03:55.836 --> 03:58.103
Are we expecting anyone?

03:59.639 --> 04:01.506
Amy! I'll call you back.

04:01.540 --> 04:03.875
- Hi!
- Hey, Val!

04:03.909 --> 04:06.409
I've got a horse I want you to look at.

04:06.444 --> 04:08.412
Whoa!

04:08.447 --> 04:09.847
Easy...

04:09.883 --> 04:11.548
His name's Flame.

04:14.443 --> 04:17.365
S11E01
Baby on Board

04:18.377 --> 04:21.413
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

04:55.925 --> 04:58.459
Hmm.

04:58.494 --> 05:01.028
More importantly,
he's a high-end show jumper.

05:01.064 --> 05:03.064
Incredibly expensive.

05:03.098 --> 05:04.833
And unfortunately,

05:04.867 --> 05:07.701
the animal was traumatized in
an accident with a grain truck.

05:07.737 --> 05:09.069
Well, have you had him looked at?

05:09.105 --> 05:12.404
I've taken him everywhere for help,
but nothing's worked.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.507
I need someone to get
him back to normal.

05:14.543 --> 05:17.711
And Flame's "normal"
is winning every event he enters.

05:17.745 --> 05:20.245
Well, I can definitely work
with getting him desensitized.

05:21.281 --> 05:23.050
My trainers did that.

05:23.084 --> 05:24.684
He's not afraid of loud noises any more.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.386
He's even getting used to the trailer.

05:26.420 --> 05:28.553
No, that's not the problem.

05:28.588 --> 05:30.723
The problem is he won't jump.

05:30.757 --> 05:33.725
Great, huh?
A champion jumper that won't jump!

05:33.761 --> 05:37.629
Amy, you are my absolute last resort.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.165
Can you do it?

05:39.199 --> 05:40.966
Yeah, if-if I have enough time, I'm...

05:41.002 --> 05:43.069
The Okotoks District show
is just a few weeks away

05:43.103 --> 05:44.870
- and I want him in shape by then.
- Val!

05:44.904 --> 05:46.571
- The way he used to be.
- A few weeks?

05:46.605 --> 05:48.372
I'm not sure that that's enough time.

05:48.408 --> 05:51.641
Okay. If you feel you can't do it,
then I'll just...

05:51.677 --> 05:54.946
No... I... I can work something out.

05:55.713 --> 05:56.646
Good.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.848
I'll check in on your progress.

06:07.764 --> 06:09.759
Yeah. Okay, hang on.

06:09.795 --> 06:12.329
Ty, I've got the salesman on
the phone from the dealership.

06:12.365 --> 06:14.463
He has the truck there. Are we gonna go?

06:14.500 --> 06:16.300
I'll look after Lyndy.

06:17.917 --> 06:19.334
Okay. Okay.

06:19.370 --> 06:21.237
Could you just make sure
that she has her nap?

06:21.273 --> 06:23.028
- I think I got it.
- Okay.

06:23.399 --> 06:25.807
Okay, we're on our way. Yeah. Thanks.

06:25.843 --> 06:28.576
I'll see you soon, okay?

06:28.612 --> 06:30.312
Okay!

06:30.348 --> 06:33.516
Oh! Uh, that's 20 minutes until her nap.
Okay, Jack?

06:33.550 --> 06:34.918
What is that?

06:34.952 --> 06:36.750
It's my baby app.

06:36.786 --> 06:38.387
It tells me when Lyndy
needs to go to sleep.

06:38.422 --> 06:40.487
An app. That's insane.

06:40.524 --> 06:42.156
When baby's cry, they're either hungry,

06:42.192 --> 06:43.858
they need to sleep or
they need to be changed.

06:43.894 --> 06:45.593
Or all three!

06:45.629 --> 06:48.329
20 minutes. No longer, okay?

06:48.365 --> 06:50.034
An app...

06:51.199 --> 06:53.834
Well...

06:53.869 --> 06:56.170
we're gonna make that...

06:56.204 --> 06:58.973
21 minutes, you and me, aren't we?

06:59.007 --> 07:01.442
Oh yeah, oh...

07:04.012 --> 07:06.896
Whoa! Hey! Easy, easy...

07:07.050 --> 07:08.348
You're okay.

07:08.384 --> 07:11.684
You're okay.

07:11.718 --> 07:13.954
Hey. Just trot. Just trot.

07:20.461 --> 07:22.627
There you go, right there.
There's a nice truck.

07:22.663 --> 07:24.564
Cal,
got a call on line 2...

07:24.598 --> 07:26.165
I can't afford that, Tim! No way.

07:26.201 --> 07:28.233
Ah, don't pay attention to the price.

07:28.269 --> 07:30.468
My guy's gonna give you a great deal.
Trust me.

07:31.939 --> 07:33.439
Hey!

07:33.473 --> 07:35.074
Mitch! How's it going? Hey, Ty!

07:35.108 --> 07:37.576
Good, good. Hey!
Congratulations on the baby!

07:37.610 --> 07:39.310
Uh, boy...? Girl...?

07:39.346 --> 07:41.512
Thank you, yeah.
It's a girl. It's a girl.

07:41.548 --> 07:44.014
So you're, uh,
working in Calgary now, right?

07:44.050 --> 07:46.317
Yeah. Oh, I was just in town,
uh, visiting a buddy.

07:46.353 --> 07:48.353
I thought I'd stop by the lot. It's...

07:48.387 --> 07:50.254
my dad's truck, he wants me to sell it.

07:50.290 --> 07:52.255
Cal?
You got a call on line 2.

07:52.292 --> 07:54.125
Uh, so how's the new job?

07:54.159 --> 07:55.725
It's uh, it's good.

07:55.761 --> 07:57.848
Yeah, it's-it's a nice change.

07:59.499 --> 08:02.132
Uh, nice seeing you.
I'll see you around.

08:02.166 --> 08:04.401
Okay. All right, see ya.

08:06.971 --> 08:09.072
Uh, look, Tim, about this truck...

08:09.108 --> 08:11.108
Good deal or not,
I'm not ready to pay half this price,

08:11.143 --> 08:12.675
- so I'm gonna...
- You believe that guy, huh?

08:12.711 --> 08:14.411
Could you believe that?

08:14.446 --> 08:17.463
Acting like that after
what he put Lou through.

08:19.582 --> 08:22.050
It's in the past, Tim.
You gotta let it go.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.286
You're okay...

08:25.322 --> 08:27.055
- Do you want me to hold him?
- Sure.

08:27.091 --> 08:28.856
- Yeah.
- You're okay.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.528
Ho... no.

08:36.066 --> 08:37.631
Ho...

08:39.735 --> 08:41.244
Easy...

08:46.176 --> 08:49.269
This is gonna take a lot
longer than I thought.

08:50.147 --> 08:52.778
Agghhh! I'm sorry. I'm just so tired.

08:52.813 --> 08:54.313
Isn't Lindy sleeping through the night?

08:54.350 --> 08:57.918
She was. But now she's waking
up every couple of hours.

08:57.952 --> 09:00.187
Pediatrician calls it sleep regression.

09:00.221 --> 09:02.121
The last couple of
weeks have been brutal.

09:02.158 --> 09:04.124
Didn't you say Ty's mom wants to come?

09:04.159 --> 09:05.426
She could help out.

09:05.461 --> 09:08.095
That's what I was hoping...
if Ty lets her.

09:08.129 --> 09:10.196
- What do you mean?
- Well, it's sweet.

09:10.230 --> 09:12.398
I mean, he loves her so much,

09:12.433 --> 09:14.667
but I think he believes
he's the only one

09:14.701 --> 09:16.302
that can take care of her properly.

09:16.336 --> 09:17.970
What?! Ty's not a control freak.

09:18.004 --> 09:20.405
No, not usually.
But when it comes to his daughter,

09:20.442 --> 09:21.708
look out.

09:25.113 --> 09:26.445
Let me try.

09:26.480 --> 09:27.778
Yeah?

09:27.813 --> 09:29.163
Okay.

09:32.125 --> 09:33.784
Good boy...

09:36.155 --> 09:37.522
Good boy.

09:38.792 --> 09:40.658
Easy...

09:46.917 --> 09:49.056
Good boy.

09:49.638 --> 09:50.734
Hoo...

09:51.836 --> 09:53.669
Hoo...

09:55.140 --> 09:57.207
Oh, good boy...

09:57.243 --> 09:59.042
Shhh... Shhh...

10:00.378 --> 10:02.511
Good.

10:06.485 --> 10:09.184
Oh, good, we didn't miss dinner.

10:09.221 --> 10:10.852
Do you ever?

10:10.888 --> 10:13.590
Here. Yeah...

10:13.625 --> 10:15.658
That's way too much food on her spoon.

10:15.692 --> 10:18.793
She's gonna choke.
Just... just little bits, okay?

10:18.828 --> 10:21.083
Like this. There you go!

10:21.764 --> 10:24.832
So... did you see the truck?

10:24.868 --> 10:27.469
Uh... yeah, but we can't afford it.

10:27.504 --> 10:29.738
Guess who we ran into. Mitch.

10:29.773 --> 10:32.941
- Really?
- Did he say anything about...?

10:32.975 --> 10:34.509
About Lou? No.

10:34.543 --> 10:36.409
He just talked about his job in Calgary

10:36.446 --> 10:38.211
and how good it was for him.

10:38.248 --> 10:41.914
Whatever happened between Mitch
and Lou is their business.

10:41.951 --> 10:43.518
It's not ours.

10:43.552 --> 10:45.219
Ty, I know you don't wanna hear this,

10:45.254 --> 10:47.221
but your mom called again.

10:47.256 --> 10:49.624
Actually, she's coming in the morning.

10:49.658 --> 10:52.024
Amy, I told you this isn't a good time.

10:52.059 --> 10:54.226
I can only put her off for so long, Ty.
It'll be fine.

10:54.263 --> 10:56.928
She's
just coming for a few days.

10:59.400 --> 11:02.402
We should go. It's Lyndy's bedtime.

11:02.437 --> 11:05.504
Come on.
We gotta stick to a schedule, so...

11:05.541 --> 11:07.640
Come on, Lyndy!

11:07.676 --> 11:09.607
Okay!

11:09.644 --> 11:11.277
Well, enjoy your dinner.

11:19.687 --> 11:22.788
It's okay. I got this. I got it.

11:22.822 --> 11:25.990
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh...

11:26.024 --> 11:28.458
Hey, Lyndy,
I know you're hungry.

11:28.495 --> 11:31.095
- Daddy's gonna feed you, okay?
- She can't be hungry, Ty.

11:31.129 --> 11:32.897
I just fed her.

11:32.932 --> 11:34.432
- When did you feed her?
- I don't know.

11:34.466 --> 11:35.799
I was half asleep.

11:35.835 --> 11:38.101
Well, you gotta keep track, Amy.
You gotta write it down.

11:38.136 --> 11:39.671
Did you pump?
Is there a bottle in the fridge?

11:39.706 --> 11:41.438
Yes. There is.

11:41.474 --> 11:43.673
Okay, well... I'll do this feeding.

11:43.709 --> 11:45.741
You get some more sleep, okay?

11:45.777 --> 11:48.077
Okay...

11:48.113 --> 11:50.279
Shh, shh.
I'm gonna get your bottle, okay?

11:50.316 --> 11:52.349
Mommy needs her sleep right now.

11:52.384 --> 11:54.650
Oh!
Shh, shh, shh...

11:54.687 --> 11:58.654
Mommy needs her sleep, okay?
We don't wanna wake her up.

12:16.139 --> 12:18.306
Mmm... good! Yeah!

12:18.341 --> 12:20.508
I think she liked yesterday's

12:20.543 --> 12:22.244
banana, spinach and broccoli better.

12:22.278 --> 12:23.811
Well, we're on a new cycle now.

12:23.846 --> 12:26.147
Carrots, avocadoes and pears.

12:26.182 --> 12:27.481
So we're gonna try this for three days,

12:27.517 --> 12:29.650
make sure she doesn't have
an allergic reaction to it,

12:29.686 --> 12:32.354
okay?

12:33.058 --> 12:35.688
I would say
that was a reaction.

12:35.725 --> 12:37.591
Hello!

12:38.150 --> 12:40.494
Wow! This place!

12:40.528 --> 12:42.162
Look what you've done with it!

12:42.197 --> 12:44.298
And you two...

12:44.332 --> 12:46.032
the new parents!

12:46.067 --> 12:47.834
Hi, Mom. How you doing?

12:47.870 --> 12:51.169
Oh... I'm doing really good!

12:51.205 --> 12:54.407
Oh, but I can't wait to
get my hands on the baby!

12:54.442 --> 12:56.375
There she is! Oh...

12:56.411 --> 12:58.878
Just be careful with her head there.
Okay.

12:58.913 --> 13:01.013
Hello!

13:01.048 --> 13:03.515
Hello, beautiful!

13:08.363 --> 13:11.653
Oh, Mommy is tired.

13:11.804 --> 13:13.572
Why don't you have a shower?

13:13.606 --> 13:14.806
I'll watch after Lyndy.

13:14.841 --> 13:16.274
I would love that. Thanks, Lily.

13:16.308 --> 13:19.043
Uh, I'm... I'm here, Mom.
I can look after her.

13:19.077 --> 13:21.412
No...

13:21.447 --> 13:24.581
Oh, that's her alarm for her nap now,
so...

13:24.616 --> 13:26.583
Oh no, c'mon, I just got here.

13:26.619 --> 13:29.886
Oh, she doesn't need a nap.
She's not tired.

13:29.923 --> 13:32.088
I know what a tired baby looks like.

13:32.124 --> 13:33.758
Well, she's been up for 90 minutes now

13:33.793 --> 13:36.426
and that's when we normally
start to put her down, so...

13:36.461 --> 13:38.028
Come on, Lyndy.
- 90 minutes.

13:38.062 --> 13:40.429
Is there something
scientific about that fact?

13:40.465 --> 13:41.831
Uh, yeah, actually, it is. Yeah.

13:41.866 --> 13:44.267
Amy and I read this book
about baby sleep patterns

13:44.302 --> 13:45.735
and I have this app...

13:45.770 --> 13:48.605
Oh, you got apps, you got books.

13:48.639 --> 13:51.740
There's no hard and fast rules.
Every baby is different.

13:51.777 --> 13:53.174
Uh, I know that, Mom,

13:53.210 --> 13:55.610
but they've proven that babies
have natural sleep cycles and...

13:55.645 --> 13:58.013
They do! They sleep when they're tired.

13:58.048 --> 14:00.481
Not when some "app"
tells them they should be tired.

14:00.517 --> 14:02.250
They've proven it, Mom.

14:03.453 --> 14:05.687
Look at you, uh? You're expert now.

14:07.356 --> 14:09.024
I'm gonna ask you to
go to the grocery store

14:09.059 --> 14:10.692
and get me some food.

14:10.726 --> 14:13.126
Uh, wow. What have you got in here?

14:13.162 --> 14:15.028
Hmm. Where's your pantry?

14:15.065 --> 14:17.465
Uh, just beside the stove.

14:18.533 --> 14:20.234
Don't leave her alone with the baby,
okay?

14:20.269 --> 14:22.168
What? Why?

14:22.205 --> 14:25.038
Because she's... in-inexperienced, Amy.

14:25.075 --> 14:27.506
Lyndy will be fine.
I'm gonna be right here.

14:27.542 --> 14:29.842
Well,
I think all you have in this house

14:29.878 --> 14:32.245
are baby fruits and vegetables.

14:32.279 --> 14:33.679
Mom, why don't you go to the store?

14:33.716 --> 14:36.883
I'll stay here and look after
Lyndy while Amy showers.

14:36.918 --> 14:39.621
'Cause I don't know where the
grocery stores are in Hudson.

14:40.554 --> 14:42.588
I'm gonna make everybody
a really nice dinner,

14:42.625 --> 14:44.724
so I need everything on this list.

14:44.759 --> 14:46.826
And while you're out I'm
gonna make sure Amy has a nap.

14:46.860 --> 14:49.894
Poor thing looks like
she's about to drop.

14:49.931 --> 14:52.865
Her 90 minutes are definitely up.

14:54.735 --> 14:55.900
Amy's fine, Mom, okay?

14:55.937 --> 14:57.702
She just needs to watch the baby.

14:57.739 --> 14:58.937
I'm gonna watch the baby.

14:58.972 --> 15:00.804
I can't take my eyes off of her.

15:00.841 --> 15:03.206
You're worrying too much.

15:03.243 --> 15:07.044
I was a mother once too;
have you forgotten?

15:07.080 --> 15:09.114
No, I haven't.

15:11.172 --> 15:13.073
Hey.

15:15.121 --> 15:17.821
I'm really proud of you.

15:17.856 --> 15:19.556
Thanks, Mom.

15:25.865 --> 15:27.030
You're good at this.

15:27.066 --> 15:29.231
You probably have a lot to teach me,
all right?

15:29.268 --> 15:30.943
Okay...

15:31.671 --> 15:33.202
Come here. And stand.

15:34.201 --> 15:35.672
Good.

15:41.211 --> 15:43.779
Too soon, huh?

15:43.815 --> 15:47.415
Okay. We'll just take it slow.
That's fine.

15:47.451 --> 15:50.251
Hi, I'm Lily, I'm Ty's mom.

15:50.288 --> 15:51.886
You must be Georgie.

15:51.922 --> 15:53.855
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

15:53.890 --> 15:55.456
I just wanted to say a quick hello.

15:55.491 --> 15:57.591
- I've heard so much about you.
- Yeah, me too...

15:57.626 --> 15:59.417
I mean, about you.

15:59.996 --> 16:01.863
- Who's this?
- This is Flame.

16:01.899 --> 16:03.264
He's a champion show jumper,

16:03.299 --> 16:05.232
but he's recovering from some trauma.

16:05.268 --> 16:06.500
Oh, really?

16:06.535 --> 16:08.570
Yeah, Amy and I are trying
to get him to jump again,

16:08.605 --> 16:10.336
but right now he doesn't want to.

16:10.371 --> 16:12.538
Well, sometimes the only way
to get back into the action

16:12.575 --> 16:14.240
is to "jump" right into it.

16:14.275 --> 16:16.309
Right. But sometimes
if you jump too soon,

16:16.345 --> 16:18.166
then it's easy to move backwards.

16:18.462 --> 16:20.880
Trust me.
I know something about that too.

16:20.917 --> 16:23.116
Well, look who's here!

16:24.250 --> 16:25.818
Jack!

16:25.854 --> 16:27.821
Oh... it's so good to see you.

16:27.855 --> 16:30.623
Well, likewise!
And you're looking great.

16:30.658 --> 16:32.591
Thank you. I feel great.

16:32.626 --> 16:35.028
I should get back.
I can't stay away from that baby.

16:35.062 --> 16:37.296
Couldn't you just eat her up?

17:01.221 --> 17:03.320
Gentlemen. How you doin'?

17:04.891 --> 17:06.923
Beauty, isn't it?

17:06.960 --> 17:08.858
Dave Chalmers.

17:08.894 --> 17:10.928
Ty Borden. Good to meet you.

17:10.963 --> 17:14.915
Yeah, it's my wife's,
but she wants a van.

17:15.334 --> 17:19.169
Kill me now, right?
Never thought I'd see the day.

17:19.203 --> 17:23.673
So... 7 years old,
it has hardly any miles on it.

17:23.708 --> 17:26.342
Uh, she basically just used it
to take our two boys to school

17:26.377 --> 17:28.711
and hockey practice.

17:28.747 --> 17:31.080
Well, my wife and I just had a baby,
so...

17:31.115 --> 17:33.650
Oh, so you want an actual truck, and...

17:33.684 --> 17:37.219
not a classic icon, 'cause...
that's what that is.

17:37.255 --> 17:40.189
Exactly. It's been a great truck, but...

17:40.223 --> 17:41.856
You do all the work on it yourself?

17:41.893 --> 17:43.925
Yeah.
Yeah, I keep it running pretty smooth.

17:43.961 --> 17:45.527
- Good for you.
- Thanks.

17:45.561 --> 17:47.528
Good skills to have.

17:47.564 --> 17:50.750
So, uh, what do you want for it?

17:51.167 --> 17:53.867
I don't know, I'm open to offers.

17:53.903 --> 17:56.369
Take it for a spin. You'll see.

17:56.405 --> 17:58.572
It's a great truck.

17:58.607 --> 18:01.608
I hate to sell it, but like I said,

18:01.644 --> 18:03.477
the wife wants a van.

18:05.515 --> 18:07.315
Good boy!

18:07.349 --> 18:10.017
See, you're getting used to them now,
huh?

18:11.452 --> 18:15.021
Hey! Well, that's looking good!

18:15.057 --> 18:17.557
Thanks.
He's a lot more relaxed on the flat now,

18:17.592 --> 18:19.992
but I don't know if he's
ready for jumps yet.

18:20.028 --> 18:22.229
Well, why don't we give it a try,
you know?

18:22.263 --> 18:24.931
Just see how it goes and
if he doesn't like it,

18:24.965 --> 18:26.597
then we'll go back to the basics.

18:26.634 --> 18:28.000
Okay.

18:28.036 --> 18:29.935
All right, boy.
You ready for this?

18:52.159 --> 18:53.924
Nice!

18:53.961 --> 18:56.693
- You're looking good!
- Thanks!

18:56.730 --> 18:58.596
Hi!

18:58.631 --> 19:00.163
Amy, this is Chad Hill,

19:00.199 --> 19:02.398
- Flame's trainer.
- Hi, Chad.

19:02.433 --> 19:03.933
- Good to meet you.
- You too.

19:03.970 --> 19:06.303
Just thought I'd stop by,
see how it's going.

19:06.338 --> 19:09.373
Well,
it's a little early in the game to tell.

19:09.407 --> 19:11.575
Why is Georgie riding him?
I hired you.

19:11.609 --> 19:14.611
Well, Georgie always works with me.

19:14.645 --> 19:16.811
Oh.

19:16.847 --> 19:20.148
Well,
let's see if there's any improvement.

19:20.184 --> 19:23.051
- Chad?
- Yeah.

19:23.087 --> 19:24.186
I don't believe we've met.

19:24.221 --> 19:26.088
Sorry, this is Ty's mom, Lily.

19:26.124 --> 19:28.156
- Lily, Val Stanton.
- Hi.

19:28.643 --> 19:30.926
Oh, how nice to meet you finally.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.627
You weren't at the wedding, were you?

19:32.663 --> 19:36.064
N-No. No, I wasn't. I was ill.

19:36.099 --> 19:38.566
That's a shame. It was beautiful.

19:39.635 --> 19:42.104
Whoa! Whoa, boy!

19:42.138 --> 19:44.940
Whoa!

19:44.974 --> 19:47.808
Whoa.

19:47.844 --> 19:50.443
Easy...
Easy...

19:51.881 --> 19:54.115
Whoa.

19:57.220 --> 19:58.551
Uh, he's no better.

19:58.586 --> 20:00.421
- If anything, he's worse.
- Amy!

20:00.455 --> 20:02.423
Hold on!
Georgie's been working with him

20:02.458 --> 20:04.224
and she's finally got him to a point

20:04.259 --> 20:05.615
where he's comfortable
going over the jumps.

20:05.696 --> 20:07.432
Really.

20:08.195 --> 20:10.997
Well, you better show me.

20:17.138 --> 20:19.306
Let's try it again.

20:19.340 --> 20:21.807
You can do this.

20:53.940 --> 20:56.140
- Good boy...
- That was pretty good.

20:56.175 --> 20:58.275
- I'm impressed.
- Thanks.

20:58.309 --> 21:00.376
I'd like you to keep training with him

21:00.412 --> 21:03.880
and if I see even more progress,
who knows?

21:03.914 --> 21:06.749
Maybe you'll be the one to
ride him in the Okotoks show.

21:06.785 --> 21:09.486
Are... you kidding me?

21:09.520 --> 21:12.321
You're letting this kid ride my horse?

21:13.758 --> 21:17.093
Chad, he's my horse.

21:18.761 --> 21:20.061
Great.

21:20.097 --> 21:21.529
Okay, I'm outta here.

21:21.565 --> 21:24.900
Um, Ms. Stanton, I'm flattered, but I...

21:24.934 --> 21:27.269
Flame is not ready to show yet.

21:27.305 --> 21:30.638
Georgie and I still have a
lot of work to do with him.

21:30.673 --> 21:32.839
Then do it.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.209
There are a lot of riders out there

21:34.243 --> 21:36.377
with way more experience than you have

21:36.413 --> 21:38.679
that would leap at this opportunity.

21:40.583 --> 21:43.250
So you think about it.

21:56.555 --> 21:58.788
What do you think? Do you like it?

21:58.824 --> 22:01.357
- I got a great deal on it, guys.
- You bought a new truck?

22:01.393 --> 22:02.892
- I wanted to help you choose.
- I know, Amy,

22:02.928 --> 22:04.361
but I had to make a quick decision.

22:04.395 --> 22:06.663
Wait, where's your old truck?
You didn't trade it in, did you?

22:06.698 --> 22:08.698
- No. No way I'd do that.
- Looks good!

22:08.733 --> 22:10.599
Yeah. Not bad. Pretty good shape.

22:10.634 --> 22:12.734
Yeah, I guess it is kinda nice.

22:12.769 --> 22:14.369
- Yeah, you like it?
- Yeah.

22:14.404 --> 22:16.404
- Do you wanna go for a drive?
- Sure.

22:16.441 --> 22:18.773
Okay. Hey, uh, Tim?

22:18.808 --> 22:20.909
Could you pick up my old truck?
I'll text you the address.

22:20.944 --> 22:22.178
Seriously?

22:23.280 --> 22:24.923
Yeah, sure.

22:42.532 --> 22:44.597
What? Is there gas in it?

22:44.634 --> 22:46.299
Yeah, I filled it up.

22:46.335 --> 22:48.944
- What's wrong with it?
- I don't know!

23:03.710 --> 23:06.719
I can fix that truck, okay? No problem.

23:06.753 --> 23:08.953
You shouldn't have to fix it.
You should get your money back.

23:08.990 --> 23:10.756
See what you can do first.

23:10.791 --> 23:12.924
If you can't get it runnin',
then Tim's right,

23:12.960 --> 23:14.727
you gotta take it back to the guy.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.162
You should've taken me with you.

23:16.198 --> 23:18.297
I'm perfectly capable of buying
a truck without your help.

23:18.332 --> 23:20.332
Apparently not.

23:20.366 --> 23:23.434
Lily... great meal you made. Thank you.

23:23.470 --> 23:24.769
Thank you.

23:24.805 --> 23:27.455
Must feel good to be back on your feet.

23:29.375 --> 23:31.410
I've... got some experience
with what you've been through

23:31.444 --> 23:33.444
the past few years.

23:37.182 --> 23:41.117
Well, who would like some dessert?

23:41.153 --> 23:43.487
I've got a lovely fruit salad...

23:43.522 --> 23:46.757
Um thanks, Mom, but actually,
it's time for bed right now so...

23:46.791 --> 23:48.558
I will put her down for bed.

23:48.595 --> 23:50.228
Why don't you guys have some dessert?

23:50.262 --> 23:52.894
- Just stay and relax.
- No, uh, they're fine.

23:52.931 --> 23:55.030
You're a guest. Guests don't work.

23:55.066 --> 23:57.834
She's used to us, Mom. Thanks though.

23:57.868 --> 24:00.537
And thank you for dinner. Goodnight.

24:00.571 --> 24:02.271
Goodnight, sweetie.

24:20.290 --> 24:23.358
- Can I help?
- Oh, fingers crossed.

24:23.394 --> 24:26.394
Hey, do you remember your yum yum?

24:26.429 --> 24:28.162
My yum yum?

24:28.196 --> 24:30.830
Your yum yum.
You couldn't sleep without it.

24:30.866 --> 24:33.233
His "yum yum"?

24:33.269 --> 24:36.537
Yes, it was his favourite
blankie and he loved it,

24:36.573 --> 24:40.173
And it solved all of his sleep problems.

24:40.209 --> 24:42.643
So I've brought you
two something to try.

24:43.878 --> 24:46.846
Oh... Mom,
I think that might be a bit of a hazard.

24:46.882 --> 24:48.714
Just if it like wraps around her face.

24:48.750 --> 24:50.416
No, it won't.

24:50.451 --> 24:52.885
I read all the parenting chat rooms

24:52.921 --> 24:54.688
and they say that babies love them.

24:54.722 --> 24:56.855
And new parents love it even more.

24:56.892 --> 24:58.291
Well, thank you, Lily...

24:58.326 --> 25:00.159
But we have to find our own way

25:00.193 --> 25:02.327
to get Lyndy to sleep, so... um...

25:03.330 --> 25:05.163
probably not.

25:05.199 --> 25:06.332
But thank you though.

25:06.366 --> 25:09.101
Well, um...
why don't you just relax.

25:10.404 --> 25:12.704
Or if...
if you wanna go back to the house...

25:12.740 --> 25:15.642
I mean, I'm sure it's
probably a lot quieter there.

25:16.143 --> 25:18.125
Okay.

25:18.612 --> 25:21.134
Okay. I'll do that.

25:24.951 --> 25:27.852
You know what else is a bit of a hazard?

25:27.886 --> 25:30.922
You should really have a gate
at the top of these stairs

25:30.957 --> 25:33.589
so that the baby doesn't fall down.

25:33.625 --> 25:35.625
I don't know,
that seems way more dangerous to me

25:35.661 --> 25:37.093
than my Little Lambie blanket.

25:37.128 --> 25:39.962
Oh, but maybe your app disagrees.

25:39.998 --> 25:41.464
We're gonna get baby gates!

25:41.500 --> 25:44.335
It's just she's not walking yet.

25:44.369 --> 25:45.770
Fine.

26:00.317 --> 26:02.884
May I join?

26:02.920 --> 26:04.386
'Kay.

26:08.726 --> 26:10.892
So...

26:12.363 --> 26:14.496
Let's just get this out on the table.

26:14.530 --> 26:17.231
You don't trust me with
your granddaughter.

26:17.267 --> 26:18.799
Our granddaughter.

26:18.836 --> 26:20.134
Okay.

26:26.683 --> 26:28.436
You know,
if there's anything I learned in rehab

26:28.519 --> 26:32.278
it's to be honest with yourself
and with everyone else.

26:36.902 --> 26:39.579
I used to have a problem with alcohol

26:40.655 --> 26:43.055
and a problem with pills.

26:43.090 --> 26:44.857
I'm aware of that.

26:46.728 --> 26:48.461
Yeah, it's a condition, I think...

26:48.497 --> 26:50.162
that you mentioned at the table,

26:50.198 --> 26:52.432
you're very familiar with.

26:55.236 --> 26:57.490
We have it in common.

27:01.909 --> 27:07.077
We also have that beautiful
little granddaughter in common.

27:07.114 --> 27:09.130
Yes, we do.

27:10.083 --> 27:12.182
So why aren't you helping
with the bedtime routine?

27:12.219 --> 27:13.818
I thought you couldn't wait.

27:13.854 --> 27:16.451
'Cause they kicked me out.

27:17.355 --> 27:20.023
Amy and Ty,
they don't want any help from me

27:20.058 --> 27:21.659
and they're not gonna take my advice.

27:21.693 --> 27:24.429
Tell me about it.

27:24.463 --> 27:26.431
I offered to help Ty buy a truck.

27:26.465 --> 27:28.665
He ended up buying a lemon from some guy

27:28.701 --> 27:30.434
at the end of a driveway.

27:30.470 --> 27:33.001
He thinks he knows everything.

27:34.072 --> 27:35.905
Oh, I guess new parents,
they think they know it all

27:35.941 --> 27:39.342
- even when they don't.
- But we didn't, right?

27:39.376 --> 27:41.310
We felt our way through.

27:41.346 --> 27:44.346
Yeah, but you'd think that they
would at least listen to experience.

27:44.382 --> 27:45.714
Not a chance!

27:45.750 --> 27:47.584
All Ty wants to do is
listen to that app!

27:47.618 --> 27:50.085
Oh my God, please do not get me started.

27:50.119 --> 27:54.122
He'd ask Siri what to do with
a baby before he'd ask me.

27:54.157 --> 27:56.223
I mean, and most of it's
just common sense, right?

27:56.259 --> 27:57.726
You know what would
really be common sense?

27:57.761 --> 27:59.662
If they got a gate at
the top of those stairs.

27:59.697 --> 28:02.631
- I told them!
- Right? Lyndy can fall down.

28:06.803 --> 28:09.570
We'll do something about that.

28:14.376 --> 28:16.143
Deal.

28:27.455 --> 28:30.891
I've tried everything.
I can't this thing to start.

28:30.925 --> 28:33.058
Go get your money back.
I'll come with you.

28:34.076 --> 28:35.561
Thanks, Tim,
but I don't need you to hold my hand.

28:35.597 --> 28:38.131
- I can do it myself.
- It's still not working?

28:38.165 --> 28:40.066
What have you decided to do?

28:40.102 --> 28:41.567
I'm gonna have to get my money back.

28:41.603 --> 28:43.836
Yeah, and make sure the guy
pays for you to tow this lemon

28:43.872 --> 28:45.637
back to his place.

28:45.673 --> 28:48.807
- Amy, where's the baby?
- With your mom.

28:48.843 --> 28:51.844
- What? No, Amy.
- Ty, she's great with Lyndy!

28:51.880 --> 28:53.913
You have to trust her.

28:53.948 --> 28:56.181
I-I... I don't.

28:56.217 --> 28:57.715
I gotta go work with Georgie, okay?

28:57.750 --> 29:00.317
I've left the baby with your mom before.

29:00.353 --> 29:02.520
- What?
- I'll do it.

29:02.556 --> 29:03.954
I'll do it.

29:03.990 --> 29:06.391
You guys, you're crazy! Both of you.

29:12.566 --> 29:15.633
Hey, what's up?

29:15.667 --> 29:17.667
Ty is driving me nuts.

29:17.702 --> 29:19.135
How's Flame?

29:19.171 --> 29:21.270
He's a lot more relaxed.
I think he's psyched to do this.

29:21.306 --> 29:22.907
Nice. Let's see.

29:38.557 --> 29:39.488
Good boy!

29:53.037 --> 29:54.702
Looks good!

29:54.738 --> 29:57.772
He's got it. Do you wanna give it a try?

29:57.807 --> 29:59.907
Uh, I think we should keep
the bond between you two.

29:59.943 --> 30:01.676
Come on, I know you're dying to do it.

30:01.711 --> 30:04.011
Look at Spartan over there.
Looks like he's jealous.

30:04.048 --> 30:07.146
Hey, and you even brought your helmet.

30:44.049 --> 30:45.471
So he won't give you your money back?

30:45.587 --> 30:47.320
No. He absolutely refused.

30:48.324 --> 30:50.557
What's this?

30:50.593 --> 30:52.025
I just installed that.

30:52.059 --> 30:53.727
The baby's gonna be crawling anytime.

30:53.761 --> 30:55.929
You don't want her
tumbling down those stairs.

30:55.963 --> 30:58.064
Well, it doesn't open, so...

30:58.099 --> 30:59.932
It works fine. Here.

31:02.670 --> 31:05.270
So how'd it go with the, with the guy?

31:05.306 --> 31:07.972
- Hi!
- Hi, Lyndy. Hey.

31:08.009 --> 31:10.075
Did you miss us?

31:10.111 --> 31:13.412
I think we're gonna have to
go over and talk to that guy.

31:13.448 --> 31:15.381
Let him know he's not
dealing with pushovers.

31:15.415 --> 31:18.183
Yeah, I agree,
just talk to him, man to man.

31:18.219 --> 31:20.417
Okay, look, guys, thank you,

31:20.453 --> 31:22.319
but I'll deal with it. It's my problem.

31:22.355 --> 31:24.756
You-you did that already.
It didn't work, so now we will.

31:24.790 --> 31:26.290
Well, I'm gonna go back right now

31:26.326 --> 31:27.991
and I'm gonna talk to him about it.

31:28.028 --> 31:29.195
Mm-hmm?

31:29.278 --> 31:31.295
There's the 90 minute mark.

31:31.345 --> 31:33.664
- Okay, Lyndy.
- 'Kay, bye, honey.

31:33.700 --> 31:36.333
Time for your nap. Okay...

31:36.368 --> 31:38.304
Yeah...

31:40.038 --> 31:42.338
- You agreed with me.
- Yeah. So?

31:42.375 --> 31:44.907
Let's go.

31:44.942 --> 31:48.679
Guys, sorry! No refunds.
He test drove the truck.

31:48.713 --> 31:51.815
He bought it as is! That's that!

31:51.849 --> 31:53.316
That's that, huh?

31:53.351 --> 31:55.151
Now we're all gentlemen here, right?

31:55.186 --> 31:56.919
We can work this out.

31:56.953 --> 31:59.655
There's nothing to work out!

31:59.691 --> 32:02.663
All right. Will you look at those two!

32:03.494 --> 32:05.827
Nice pair of long horns you got there.

32:05.863 --> 32:08.029
- We've had 'em for years.
- Really.

32:08.066 --> 32:10.298
I got a couple of those guys myself.

32:10.334 --> 32:12.233
It's obvious you're a man

32:12.269 --> 32:14.903
who appreciates the
finer things in life.

32:14.938 --> 32:17.172
Now mine were given to
me by an old friend.

32:17.208 --> 32:20.075
He passed on, sorry to say.

32:21.412 --> 32:24.179
Tell me where you got these from.

32:24.214 --> 32:26.615
I'll bet there's a story in there.

32:31.987 --> 32:34.153
You know what you need?

32:34.190 --> 32:35.955
You guys need some time to yourselves.

32:35.990 --> 32:37.724
I'll tell you what.
I'll babysit and you guys

32:37.759 --> 32:39.326
- should go out for the evening.
- Really?

32:39.362 --> 32:40.661
Really.

32:40.697 --> 32:42.195
Uh, that's okay. Thanks though, Mom.

32:42.231 --> 32:43.384
No, Ty, please!

32:43.482 --> 32:46.298
Do something nice for your wife.

32:48.502 --> 32:50.269
Okay. Okay, let's go.

32:50.305 --> 32:52.805
Okay.

32:52.840 --> 32:54.540
Okay.

33:03.579 --> 33:04.950
What?

33:04.984 --> 33:07.152
- I can't do this. Uh...
- What?

33:07.186 --> 33:09.988
- Amy, my mom is basically unstable...
- Ty!

33:10.022 --> 33:11.222
And we're leaving our daughter with her.

33:11.259 --> 33:13.525
Your mom will be fine! She's been fine.

33:13.560 --> 33:16.228
We left Lyndy with her before, remember?

33:17.880 --> 33:19.963
Nope, nope.
I can't do this! I can't.

33:26.640 --> 33:28.905
What, you're back?
Did you forget something?

33:28.941 --> 33:31.776
Mom, the baby's upset.
You just left her in her crib.

33:31.810 --> 33:35.479
Yes. I gave her the
Little Lambie blanket.

33:35.513 --> 33:37.647
- Mom!
- No, she loves it.

33:37.682 --> 33:39.482
She's learning to self-soothe.
That's really important.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.351
No, I told you,
that's dangerous.

33:41.386 --> 33:44.119
Ty, stop. She's fine.

33:44.155 --> 33:46.155
I don't get how you can
just flounce in here,

33:46.192 --> 33:47.790
- acting like raising a child...
- Flounce?

33:47.826 --> 33:49.925
Is the easiest thing in the world.
Like you know it all.

33:49.961 --> 33:52.162
Wow... You're a know-it-all,

33:52.197 --> 33:55.230
with your books, your apps,
your 90 minute theories.

33:55.266 --> 33:56.932
I'm a mother, I know what I'm doing.

33:56.967 --> 34:01.103
Oh, you were a mother?
Is that what you were?

34:01.137 --> 34:04.339
Wow. So this is what this is about.

34:04.375 --> 34:07.375
You think I'm a bad mother.

34:07.412 --> 34:09.143
- Fine.
- Mom!

34:09.179 --> 34:12.246
You know what?
No, I'm- I will leave you two alone.

34:17.721 --> 34:20.521
Damn baby gate!

34:30.199 --> 34:33.833
Hey. Listen.

35:02.463 --> 35:04.161
Hey. I got your text.

35:04.197 --> 35:05.731
What's up?

35:11.003 --> 35:13.927
You got my refund? How?

35:14.275 --> 35:18.509
Reasonable men come to
reasonable decisions.

35:20.246 --> 35:23.914
Jack, I said I was gonna handle this,
but thank you!

35:23.949 --> 35:26.072
This is amazing.

35:26.251 --> 35:28.454
Uh, uh, Ty, hold up.

35:29.155 --> 35:31.001
Have a seat.

35:31.824 --> 35:33.157
Yeah.

35:34.260 --> 35:38.159
Now I'm not real sure how to say this,
but...

35:38.597 --> 35:43.532
Now, watching you with your
new baby is interesting,

35:43.568 --> 35:46.469
how seriously you're taking it.

35:47.003 --> 35:49.539
Thanks, Jack. I appreciate that.

35:49.574 --> 35:53.409
At the hospital,
when you had your pneumonia problem

35:53.443 --> 35:55.411
after you got back from Mongolia,

35:55.445 --> 35:59.014
do you remember that
dream you kept having?

36:01.018 --> 36:02.918
Uh, dream...

36:02.952 --> 36:05.152
You were pretty out of it,

36:05.188 --> 36:07.922
going in and out of consciousness.

36:10.126 --> 36:12.626
Uh, wait a minute, yeah.

36:12.661 --> 36:14.929
- I remember a house.
- That's right.

36:14.963 --> 36:18.784
You said that your dad was
there at your old house.

36:20.536 --> 36:22.168
Yeah, he was.

36:22.204 --> 36:25.405
Uh... it was the house I grew up in.

36:25.440 --> 36:28.507
We lived there until, uh, he left us.

36:28.543 --> 36:29.463
Okay.

36:31.646 --> 36:35.782
He - I remember him telling me that,
uh, I was just like him.

36:36.885 --> 36:38.784
Anything else?

36:41.690 --> 36:43.922
He said I wasn't gonna be a good father.

36:43.958 --> 36:45.757
Really?

36:45.793 --> 36:48.626
That's what he said in the dream?

36:48.663 --> 36:50.628
Yeah, I think so. I...

36:50.664 --> 36:53.666
I don't know. Maybe.
Crazy, right?

36:53.701 --> 36:55.835
Well, crazy maybe...

36:57.237 --> 37:00.204
but I think that dream is
still kind of plaguing you,

37:00.239 --> 37:03.340
whether you know it or not.

37:03.376 --> 37:07.594
And because of it,
you just might be overcompensating.

37:07.940 --> 37:10.947
C'mon, Jack.
It was a dream. A... a hallucination.

37:10.983 --> 37:12.851
Well, you said your dad told you

37:12.885 --> 37:14.485
you weren't gonna be a good father,

37:14.521 --> 37:16.853
but I think you already had that thought

37:16.889 --> 37:18.822
in your head somewhere.

37:18.858 --> 37:21.090
And now you're trying extra hard

37:21.126 --> 37:24.427
to be the best father in the world,
no matter what.

37:26.264 --> 37:29.565
And I really do admire you for it, Ty.

37:29.601 --> 37:32.235
But you need to relax a whole lot

37:32.271 --> 37:35.505
and treasure this time
a little bit more.

37:35.539 --> 37:38.139
'Cause it's gonna go by fast,
believe me.

37:39.376 --> 37:43.311
And it's precious... you don't
wanna spend it all on worrying.

37:44.548 --> 37:46.382
This is a beautiful thing.

37:46.418 --> 37:48.583
Enjoy it.

37:55.224 --> 37:56.827
You're waisting your time, Jack.

37:56.949 --> 37:58.248
I got my money back.

37:58.284 --> 38:01.184
I'm still not interested
in your guy's truck.

38:01.219 --> 38:03.586
Line 2. Got Autoparts on line 2.

38:03.623 --> 38:05.155
Mitch.

38:05.190 --> 38:08.458
Hey. So, I uh...
I got a proposition for you.

38:09.594 --> 38:11.195
I didn't end up selling my dad's truck,

38:11.230 --> 38:15.532
and... Tim here convinced me
I could do you a good turn.

38:15.567 --> 38:17.599
So if you want it,

38:17.635 --> 38:19.469
I'll-I'll sell it to you...

38:20.639 --> 38:22.451
For?

38:22.974 --> 38:25.824
For... a very reasonable price.

38:37.889 --> 38:40.222
- Thanks for having me.
- Of course.

38:40.257 --> 38:42.014
Listen, Mom... I uh...

38:42.693 --> 38:44.226
Before you go, I gotta apologize

38:44.260 --> 38:48.362
for how I... behaved with you.

38:49.032 --> 38:51.465
- I was just...
- You were worried.

38:51.501 --> 38:53.157
You had every right to be.

38:53.224 --> 38:56.103
No. I-I... I didn't.

38:56.139 --> 39:00.108
I appreciate your help,
and I do have respect you.

39:00.143 --> 39:01.641
And I know now, as a father,

39:01.677 --> 39:03.744
what you went through raising a child,

39:03.778 --> 39:06.213
and how much you love that child.

39:06.248 --> 39:08.280
More than anything in the world!

39:08.317 --> 39:10.951
So enjoy this time together.

39:10.985 --> 39:12.452
And believe me,
if anything's gonna keep me

39:12.487 --> 39:14.420
on the straight and narrow,

39:14.456 --> 39:16.793
it's this baby.

39:18.059 --> 39:20.126
Oh, oh, oh...

39:20.161 --> 39:22.067
Oh...

39:22.630 --> 39:25.030
I hate to say goodbye.

39:25.065 --> 39:26.632
Oh...

39:26.666 --> 39:29.936
Muah. I'm gonna miss this little darlin'
so much.

39:29.971 --> 39:31.503
And you two, of course.

39:33.141 --> 39:35.273
- Please take lots of pictures!
- We will.

39:35.309 --> 39:36.909
And thank you so much for helping

39:36.945 --> 39:38.309
with the sleep training.

39:38.344 --> 39:40.244
Little Lambie did save our lives.

39:40.280 --> 39:44.148
I'm just glad
that Lyndy liked it.

39:47.019 --> 39:49.019
- Bye.
- See ya.

39:49.056 --> 39:51.356
- Bye, Mom.
- Mmm... I love you.

39:54.393 --> 39:56.492
Here, I'll get the door here for you.

39:59.297 --> 40:01.331
Come visit again soon, okay?

40:01.367 --> 40:03.800
- Mm-hmm.
- 'Kay.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.739
Wave goodbye!

40:09.775 --> 40:11.541
Bye!

40:11.577 --> 40:13.643
Wanna go for a drive?

40:13.677 --> 40:15.677
We'd love to.

40:17.849 --> 40:18.847
Wait a minute.

40:20.985 --> 40:23.052
There were only two
long horns here before.

40:25.123 --> 40:27.222
They were brown.

40:27.259 --> 40:29.807
Doesn't that black and
white one look like Jack's?

40:31.862 --> 40:34.561
No! Why would it?

40:37.802 --> 40:40.101
I wasn't supposed to say anything.
I promised.

40:40.137 --> 40:43.005
But the only way Grandpa got your refund

40:43.039 --> 40:46.139
was by giving Dave
one of his long horns.

40:47.277 --> 40:50.077
I'm gonna get that animal back for Jack.

40:59.789 --> 41:02.190
You trust me now, right?

41:02.224 --> 41:04.190
Yeah, good boy.

41:04.226 --> 41:06.726
Okay, bud. We're gonna try something.

41:06.760 --> 41:08.027
Yeah.

41:08.063 --> 41:10.096
Okay.

41:10.132 --> 41:12.032
Good boy...

41:14.735 --> 41:16.436
Shhh...

41:16.471 --> 41:18.503
We don't need a saddle, do we?

41:20.240 --> 41:22.407
Good boy.

41:41.728 --> 41:44.295
Ho. Good boy.

42:13.358 --> 42:16.759
So? What do you say? Are you in?

42:18.762 --> 42:20.561
I'm in.

42:21.632 --> 42:24.000
Good boy!

42:28.670 --> 42:30.804
Uh-oh. Did it stall?

42:33.710 --> 42:36.177
Look, Amy, I gotta apologize.

42:38.447 --> 42:40.581
I'm sorry I've been
such a control freak,

42:42.119 --> 42:44.684
and I'm sorry I messed up our night out.

42:44.721 --> 42:46.320
It's okay.

42:47.989 --> 42:50.590
20 minutes is up.

42:51.927 --> 42:54.494
We should get her home.

42:57.132 --> 42:59.599
It can wait.

43:00.668 --> 43:03.335
What're we doing?

43:03.371 --> 43:06.438
You remember how we danced when
we missed your high school formal?

43:06.474 --> 43:08.141
Yes, I do.

43:08.175 --> 43:10.909
Well, a lot has happened since then,

43:10.945 --> 43:13.512
and we got a whole future ahead of us,

43:13.547 --> 43:15.547
and we need to enjoy every minute of it.
