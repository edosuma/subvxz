WEBVTT

00:10.067 --> 00:12.967
You know, this last winter,
I hurt the body.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.367
One of the largest owies,

00:21.433 --> 00:23.933
was to the, you know,
this whole area here.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.267
One of the problems
that I have,

00:27.333 --> 00:30.667
I'm not gonna be shooting
on this side, ever again.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.833
All of my hardware
is for somebody

00:33.900 --> 00:36.133
that has a whole different
body than I have.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.933
Put on your gun belt.
Where does it hang?

00:39.000 --> 00:41.033
On the right.

00:41.100 --> 00:42.567
This is the one that's hurt.

00:44.367 --> 00:47.367
My guns, every single
stinking one of them,

00:48.700 --> 00:52.967
is made to go here,
on the right.

00:53.033 --> 00:57.033
So, I'm gonna fly to town,
see my buddy Gary,

00:57.100 --> 01:00.300
get a gun made and get back
here, so I can protect myself.

01:00.833 --> 01:02.733
I can't maintain
my style of life here

01:02.800 --> 01:05.400
if I can't protect myself and
hunt for the food that I eat.

01:05.467 --> 01:09.067
If I can't do
that simple task, I'm done.

01:35.033 --> 01:37.833
I know you're saying
it's all good, it's all okay.

01:37.900 --> 01:38.933
But I know I'm putting

01:39.000 --> 01:40.500
the weight of the world
on your shoulders.

01:40.567 --> 01:42.267
I love you
and I absolutely respect you

01:42.333 --> 01:44.833
for stepping up to the plate.
That's pretty cool beans.

01:44.900 --> 01:46.300
I love you too, Auntie.
And I got this.

01:46.367 --> 01:48.767
It's a blessing
to have Jesse here,

01:48.833 --> 01:50.467
and being so capable.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.833
This time of year, if I didn't
have Jesse up here with me,

01:53.900 --> 01:55.400
I would not be able to leave.

01:55.467 --> 01:56.767
-I love you.
-Love you too, Auntie.

01:56.833 --> 01:57.967
Thank you so much
for being you.

01:58.033 --> 01:59.267
No problem, Auntie.

01:59.333 --> 02:01.967
-Family's for... (LAUGHS)
-Family sticks together.

02:02.033 --> 02:04.267
SUE: You know, the gun,
I'm excited about it.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.900
I've got an idea.

02:05.967 --> 02:08.767
But I need to see how it is,
and then find my weaknesses.

02:09.867 --> 02:11.900
Winter's coming,
the bears are out there,

02:11.967 --> 02:14.467
the wolverines are out there,
the wolves are out there.

02:15.267 --> 02:17.633
This is my life on the line.

02:25.400 --> 02:28.367
CHIP: All this nature
is the same as it was
10,000 years ago.

02:28.433 --> 02:29.700
We're the things that change.

02:37.233 --> 02:38.667
You ready, bun?

02:38.733 --> 02:41.267
I got to flip over my shoes,
so they don't get rained on.

02:41.333 --> 02:42.700
NARRATOR: The Hailstones
spend their summer

02:42.767 --> 02:44.067
along the Kiwalik River,

02:44.133 --> 02:45.700
where they only have
a brief window

02:45.767 --> 02:48.200
to gather resources
before the freeze returns.

02:48.967 --> 02:50.233
For Chip and Agnes,

02:50.300 --> 02:52.267
teaching their daughters
how to survive in the Arctic

02:52.333 --> 02:55.700
is a priority
and a valued native tradition.

02:55.767 --> 02:58.033
Okay, girls,
let's go to the greens!

02:58.100 --> 02:59.667
We can start with sour docks

02:59.733 --> 03:01.300
since the sour docks
are ready.

03:03.233 --> 03:05.267
CHIP: What we call
sour docks in English,

03:05.333 --> 03:07.400
they call quagaqs in Inupiat.

03:09.433 --> 03:11.533
And they're a local green
that we like to eat with,

03:11.600 --> 03:13.733
they're a little,
slightly on the sour side.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.467
So, they're good
with vinegar and oil,

03:15.533 --> 03:16.600
a little bit
of salt and pepper.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.233
And they're
a really good green,

03:18.300 --> 03:19.900
and they're really fresh,
and the time to pick 'em
is now.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.700
Well, you can spot these
red stalks that are up.

03:23.767 --> 03:28.233
And around 'em, there'll be,
er, nice succulent greens.

03:28.300 --> 03:29.500
And they're pretty
tasty, actually.

03:29.567 --> 03:30.733
I like 'em.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.367
I grew up eating
this kind of stuff.

03:32.433 --> 03:34.667
But we used to go gather them,
you know, on riverbeds.

03:34.733 --> 03:35.933
Not much different than this.

03:38.533 --> 03:39.800
AGNES: You girls got
to make sure you pick

03:39.867 --> 03:42.533
the right correct greens,
so we don't get sick.

03:42.600 --> 03:45.033
One year, we thought
we picked all greens,

03:45.100 --> 03:46.533
and then, there happened to be

03:46.600 --> 03:48.567
a few poisonous flowers
mixed in with those.

03:48.633 --> 03:51.000
And I happened to eat them,
and I got really sick.

03:51.067 --> 03:52.367
And after that,

03:52.433 --> 03:54.633
me and the girls started
watching every plant we pick.

03:54.700 --> 03:55.967
And they have it
in their head,

03:56.033 --> 03:57.433
if they don't pick
the correct plant

03:57.500 --> 03:58.700
somebody's gonna get sick.

03:58.767 --> 04:00.633
So, it's very important
for the girls

04:00.700 --> 04:02.633
to know what they need
to look for,

04:02.700 --> 04:04.400
it's important
for them to know

04:04.467 --> 04:05.733
where to go
to pick these things

04:05.800 --> 04:06.900
and how to preserve them.

04:07.267 --> 04:09.033
If they don't
have this experience

04:09.100 --> 04:10.800
and if they don't know
what flowers to eat,

04:10.867 --> 04:12.800
they might go hungry.

04:12.867 --> 04:14.867
Being out here, there's
no reason to go hungry

04:14.933 --> 04:16.433
if you know what you're doing.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.033
We're really not scoring
too high here, are we?

04:24.100 --> 04:26.667
Yeah, we've picked most
of the big ones already

04:26.733 --> 04:29.300
and there's just
quite a few smaller ones.

04:29.367 --> 04:30.633
CHIP:
We should just go down river.

04:30.700 --> 04:32.200
-You guys want to go
a couple miles?
-MARY: Yes.

04:32.267 --> 04:33.267
AGNES: Yeah, we could.

04:33.333 --> 04:35.000
Probably there'll
be bigger leaves.

04:38.467 --> 04:39.833
CHIP: We're heading down
to the coast.

04:39.900 --> 04:41.667
We've pretty much picked out
this whole little valley here.

04:41.733 --> 04:43.200
Don't ever wanna impact
an area too heavy

04:43.267 --> 04:44.700
that it wouldn't grow back.

04:44.767 --> 04:46.233
We go for quality,
not quantity.

04:46.300 --> 04:48.800
So, we're gonna go
wherever it's wet.

04:48.867 --> 04:50.800
Wherever you see lakes,
wherever you see rivers,

04:50.867 --> 04:52.933
creeks, things like that,
that's where we'll be,

04:53.000 --> 04:54.033
and that's where
the quagaq will be.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.933
MARTHA: There's lots
of opportunities,

05:01.000 --> 05:02.967
depends on what you wake up to
in the morning.

05:03.033 --> 05:04.733
We always keep ourselves busy.

05:15.300 --> 05:18.233
My name is Martha Mae Salitan,
I'm married to Erik Salitan.

05:18.300 --> 05:21.467
I'm from Iliamna, Alaska.
Was born and raised here.

05:21.533 --> 05:24.333
I enjoy hunting,
fishing, camping,

05:24.400 --> 05:26.367
anything that has to do
with the outdoors.

05:27.367 --> 05:29.267
Beautiful day to go
play on the lake.

05:29.333 --> 05:32.000
See if I can't find
some birds.

05:32.067 --> 05:34.333
Erik left early this morning
with a fishing client,

05:34.400 --> 05:36.200
so I got the rest of the day
to go out

05:36.267 --> 05:37.833
and motor around on the lake.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.467
I'm gonna first
check out this little pond

05:43.533 --> 05:45.100
that's not too far away
from here.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.500
Erik and I have hunted
over there

05:47.567 --> 05:48.900
and been successful before,

05:48.967 --> 05:51.233
so I figured
that's a good place to go.

05:52.333 --> 05:53.767
Hopefully, I can prove to Erik

05:53.833 --> 05:56.400
that I'm just as good
a hunter as he is.

05:58.533 --> 05:59.933
NARRATOR: Martha
and Erik Salitan

06:00.000 --> 06:02.867
live on the Iliamna peninsula
during the summer months,

06:02.933 --> 06:04.667
where they hunt and fish
to maintain

06:04.733 --> 06:06.733
their subsistence lifestyle.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.033
MARTHA: I grew up out here.

06:09.100 --> 06:13.033
You really learn to love
and hate the lake.

06:13.100 --> 06:15.900
It's a renewable resource
that you can always depend on,

06:15.967 --> 06:18.700
but you also learn
it's very dangerous.

06:20.367 --> 06:23.233
It's the largest freshwater
lake here, in Alaska.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.600
Eighty miles long
by 20 miles wide.

06:25.667 --> 06:28.267
And if you get caught up here
on an ugly day,

06:28.333 --> 06:29.733
winter or summer,

06:29.800 --> 06:31.100
it could potentially
be really dangerous.

06:36.933 --> 06:38.300
This is the first spot.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.100
This little lake
that's right over here.

06:43.300 --> 06:44.567
So, we're gonna
head over there.

06:44.633 --> 06:45.767
Hopefully, there's a bird.

06:50.633 --> 06:52.000
(WHISPERS)
The lake's right there.

07:27.567 --> 07:28.867
We'll see what we got here.

07:30.433 --> 07:32.267
(WHISPERS)

07:32.333 --> 07:33.833
I'm gonna go down
a little bit further

07:33.900 --> 07:36.200
and see if I can't get
right across from 'em.

07:41.233 --> 07:42.667
They're right in front of us.

07:51.733 --> 07:52.900
(SIGHS)

08:01.867 --> 08:03.000
On to the next.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.300
There are certain kinds
of ducks that taste good,

08:05.367 --> 08:07.367
and certain kinds of ducks
that don't.

08:07.433 --> 08:09.200
Mergansers are one
of the ones that don't,

08:09.267 --> 08:11.200
so we're gonna keep moving,

08:11.267 --> 08:12.900
see if we can't find
something else.

08:14.567 --> 08:16.167
Came to this lake here.

08:16.233 --> 08:17.933
Had two birds in it.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.600
But they're just not
the kind that we want.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.100
I'm gonna load up here,

08:21.167 --> 08:23.233
go over to this island right
over here called
Rabbit Island.

08:23.300 --> 08:24.567
It's a good spot.

08:24.633 --> 08:26.900
Couple of small
little ponds on it.

08:26.967 --> 08:28.333
Hopefully, there's birds
over there.

NARRATOR: Jessie Holmes
devotes the winter season

09:02.500 --> 09:05.500
competing in sled races
with his dog team.

09:05.733 --> 09:07.600
Having proper doghouses
will ensure

09:07.667 --> 09:09.367
that the dogs stay
healthy and strong

09:09.433 --> 09:11.500
in the harsh conditions
of racing season.

09:12.233 --> 09:15.200
The theory of a doghouse
for a dog,

09:15.267 --> 09:18.433
is not to keep it warm.
It's to keep it dry.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.600
In the winter, you know,
if the dog's all wet

09:20.667 --> 09:22.633
and its fur, under-fur
is matted down,

09:22.700 --> 09:23.800
it can't stay warm.

09:23.867 --> 09:25.700
All the investment I put
in these young dogs

09:25.767 --> 09:27.733
is investing
in my future career.

09:29.333 --> 09:31.967
Time's overdue for me to get
ahead on some new houses.

09:32.033 --> 09:33.233
Then I don't
have to worry about it

09:33.300 --> 09:34.967
for, you know,
the years to come.

09:40.733 --> 09:43.300
One thing I gotta do is get
all this fireweed out of here.

09:43.367 --> 09:45.567
As much as I love it
and as beautiful as it is,

09:45.633 --> 09:47.067
I can't see the ground.

09:47.133 --> 09:48.467
This is all gonna be places

09:48.533 --> 09:51.167
where dogs are gonna end up
going if I can clear it out.

09:51.700 --> 09:53.233
So this is like gonna be
like, the beginning

09:53.300 --> 09:54.833
of my new dog yard.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.500
Right now, all I see
is a lot of work.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.967
Already I got enough sod
opened up for a couple dogs.

10:11.333 --> 10:12.367
Look at it that way,

10:12.433 --> 10:14.500
so you don't feel
like it's so much work.

10:14.567 --> 10:16.000
One step at a time.

10:20.033 --> 10:22.467
For me, I had
to like, just work hard.

10:22.533 --> 10:23.700
Deal with what I got.

10:23.767 --> 10:25.400
A lot of people would have
a big piece of machinery

10:25.467 --> 10:27.067
and have a perfectly
groomed dog yard.

10:27.133 --> 10:28.500

with what I got.

10:28.567 --> 10:30.267

is the disadvantages

10:50.133 --> 10:52.600
of doing this kind
of thing by hand.

10:52.667 --> 10:54.600
One venomous bee.

Didn't want to get stung
by a bunch of 'em. Fuck!

10:57.533 --> 11:00.133
They must have a nest in here,
I can see 'em all over.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.300
Summer's a narrow
window of opportunity

11:37.133 --> 11:38.600
(BEES BUZZING)

11:44.867 --> 11:46.733
JESSIE: I decided to go
with starting this fire and,

11:46.800 --> 11:48.567
you know, the gasoline
to try to kill 'em

11:48.633 --> 11:51.267
'cause I thought it might be
a healthier alternative

11:51.333 --> 11:53.433
than having to use
some chemical.

11:53.500 --> 11:56.100
I think it's working, I don't
see no bees hardly any more.

12:06.367 --> 12:08.067
Got a lot left to do.

12:08.133 --> 12:09.967
Hopefully, I don't get stung
by no more bees.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.333
SUE: You get out of life,
here in Alaska,

12:16.400 --> 12:17.700
what you put into it.

12:25.967 --> 12:26.967
(BEEPING)

12:28.567 --> 12:29.767
Hey, buddy.

12:31.033 --> 12:32.933
-Hey, Sue.
-SUE: Oh, hey, Eddie!

12:33.000 --> 12:34.567
NARRATOR: After an injury
left her unable

12:34.633 --> 12:37.100
to use a firearm
with her dominant side,

12:37.167 --> 12:39.200
Sue has flown 500 miles
to Fairbanks

12:39.267 --> 12:41.667
to pick up custom weaponry.

12:41.733 --> 12:43.233
-We'll start with this one.
-Okay.

12:43.300 --> 12:45.667
-This is the left-handed.
-All right.

12:45.733 --> 12:47.133
NARRATOR: The new guns
will be crucial

12:47.200 --> 12:49.967
for hunting and protection
from the tundra's predators

12:50.033 --> 12:51.467
when she returns to Kavik.

12:51.533 --> 12:54.967
SUE: My life is on the line
with my ability to hunt.

12:55.033 --> 12:58.800
What I harvest, what I get,
is what I eat.

12:58.867 --> 13:00.967
Predators are always
something that are around.

13:01.033 --> 13:02.733
There's a lot of bears,
a lot of wolves.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.800
If I can't protect myself
and other people,

13:04.867 --> 13:06.467
I can't be
the warden of Kavik.

13:06.533 --> 13:07.600
Simple as that.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
NARRATOR: Sue will be alone
in the Kavik tundra

13:11.067 --> 13:12.667
for dark winter.

13:12.733 --> 13:14.167
With the freeze approaching,

13:14.233 --> 13:16.133
teaching herself to shoot
from her left side

13:16.200 --> 13:18.233
is critical for her survival.

13:18.300 --> 13:19.733
This little place, right here,

13:19.800 --> 13:22.667
it's darn near right on top
of where I grew up,

13:22.733 --> 13:25.967
in Fairbanks, and it's been
a shooting area for me before.

13:26.033 --> 13:29.400
This is a .30-06.
But it's a lefty.

13:29.967 --> 13:32.933
And I don't even really know
how to hold it.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.133
Gary showed me a little bit,
but I don't get it yet.

13:36.600 --> 13:39.000
You know, for me,
even holding it, it's...

13:39.067 --> 13:42.133
I mean, I'm getting my beak
awful damn close
to that thing

13:42.200 --> 13:43.533
and I've got no strength.

13:44.100 --> 13:46.333
The right side
can't hold it up yet.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.500
That's the idea
for using this.

13:48.567 --> 13:50.733
This helps me steady the gun.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.233
I'm gonna sit in the chair,
at the table,

13:53.833 --> 13:55.567
raise it to the right height,
get it in there,

13:55.633 --> 13:57.100
and, hopefully,
shoot the target.

13:57.600 --> 14:01.067
What I'm gonna do is go
for that lower, left target.

14:01.133 --> 14:02.667
It is awkward as heck.

14:02.733 --> 14:04.300
I'm gonna get ready to fire.

14:05.367 --> 14:06.733
I'm scared.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.033
-(GUNSHOT FIRED)
-All right.

14:10.133 --> 14:12.167
I can see
that I've hit the paper.

14:12.633 --> 14:13.700
And there's your mark.

14:13.767 --> 14:16.600
It's not a bull's eye,
but it's in there.

14:16.667 --> 14:17.900
I definitely felt it.

14:17.967 --> 14:21.000
I'm a little scared.
Feeling tiny.

14:21.067 --> 14:22.600
But it's pretty fun.
It's always fun.

14:25.867 --> 14:29.033
-(GUNSHOT FIRED)
-Huh.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.600
I'm low and to the right.

14:30.667 --> 14:32.000
Try to line it up,

14:32.067 --> 14:34.500
trying to keep it tight,
trying not to flinch.

14:35.600 --> 14:38.900
-And I'm gonna take a shot.
-(GUNSHOT FIRED)

14:38.967 --> 14:40.967
Upper target. Left hand side.

14:41.033 --> 14:42.033
(GUNSHOT FIRED)

14:43.133 --> 14:45.900
Nailed it.
Right in the bull's-eye.

14:45.967 --> 14:47.867
They say you can't
teach an old dog new tricks.

14:47.933 --> 14:50.300
Well... (BARKING)
Yeah, you can.

14:51.033 --> 14:55.800
This is a 460, 500
Smith & Wesson pistol.

14:55.867 --> 14:58.000
This is predator
protection only.

14:58.067 --> 15:00.533
Not legal to hunt food
using a laser.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.833
What I wanna see... I'm gonna
put out some other targets

15:02.900 --> 15:05.433
and I want to see some splat.
I want to see some boom.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.933
I wanna know that
that's a predator going pow.

15:12.367 --> 15:13.367
(GUNSHOT FIRED)

15:14.633 --> 15:16.033
My thoughts are,

15:16.100 --> 15:19.100
I just want to get a feel
for what it's gonna feel like.

15:19.167 --> 15:22.800
Address the issue
that I've never done
anything leftie before.

15:22.867 --> 15:23.900
(GUNSHOT FIRED)

15:23.967 --> 15:27.633
Erm, I have some fears,
some trepidation,

15:27.700 --> 15:31.700
and, er, I don't want
to stress out the areas.

15:31.767 --> 15:35.167
I just wanna get a feel for
where are my comfort levels?

15:35.233 --> 15:36.633
(GUNSHOT FIRED)

15:36.700 --> 15:38.267
I don't want to do it
to the point...

15:38.333 --> 15:42.000
I can shoot all day long
but that's gonna damage
what's trying to heal.

15:42.067 --> 15:44.800
You know, it's kind of like
having a bite of dessert

15:44.867 --> 15:46.733
instead of the whole
freaking cake.

15:46.800 --> 15:47.867
Bear down.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.900
I think I did really well.

15:53.967 --> 15:56.233
It was a good day.
It's a great day.

15:56.300 --> 15:57.400
I'm not, you know...

15:57.467 --> 15:59.300
I wasn't worried
about anything eating me.

15:59.367 --> 16:02.500
I was blowing it all away,
and, erm,

16:02.567 --> 16:04.633
nothing wrong with having
a little boom factor

16:04.700 --> 16:06.233
for your evening
entertainment.

16:11.333 --> 16:12.867
CHIP: It's just a big cycle.

16:12.933 --> 16:15.467
And we're always getting ready
for the next cycle.

16:27.033 --> 16:28.900
Yee. My heavy bag over.

16:31.867 --> 16:34.100
We're out looking
for greens, today,

16:34.167 --> 16:35.633
and we pretty much
picked all the greens

16:35.700 --> 16:36.867
around the camp
in every place,

16:36.933 --> 16:38.700
so we're going
someplace different.

16:38.767 --> 16:40.500
Never know what
we're gonna see out there.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.433
We might need
little bit firearm

16:42.500 --> 16:44.300
to protect ourselves
from the animals,

16:44.367 --> 16:48.633
but girls used to shooting
shotgun and stuff like that.

16:48.700 --> 16:51.400
But, erm, we have a .410,

16:51.467 --> 16:53.767
so they don't have
to actually shoot

16:53.833 --> 16:56.167
a real big high-powered gun
and it's so heavy

16:56.233 --> 16:58.067
that we're running around
the tundra with it.

16:59.700 --> 17:01.733
Usually, we go out
and go get some fresh meat

17:01.800 --> 17:03.867
every other day, or go
for fishing or something,

17:03.933 --> 17:06.433
but, erm, we don't have any
fresh meat here at camp.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.067
So we're pretty much
gonna come back with meat

17:08.133 --> 17:09.667
one way or the other.

17:09.733 --> 17:13.233
It be fish, geese,
maybe just greens.

17:13.300 --> 17:16.567
I don't know there's
all kinds of different things
we can run into,

17:16.633 --> 17:19.367
seeing how we're the only
people that run this river.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.400
We sure wouldn't mind picking
a whole bunch

17:21.467 --> 17:25.367
to store for the winter
and put some away, and, erm,

17:25.433 --> 17:27.100
it's a little too hot
and no breeze up here,

17:27.167 --> 17:29.233
so we're heading to the coast
where the breeze is

17:29.300 --> 17:30.933
and where there's
less mosquitoes

17:31.000 --> 17:32.667
and hopefully bigger greens.

17:37.467 --> 17:39.967
We'll go where there's
not very tall grasses

17:40.033 --> 17:41.767
and then the leaves
should be bigger.

17:43.667 --> 17:45.867
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

over here in the channel.

-AGNES: Yep,
we are in the channel.

18:03.133 --> 18:05.500
-(ENGINE STARTING)
-CHIP: Sit down.

18:10.267 --> 18:12.467
So we're gonna go over
to the base of these hills
over here.

18:12.533 --> 18:14.667
And we're gonna, erm,
look around for greens.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.200
We're also looking for greens,
so we can eat salads

18:18.267 --> 18:20.133
and you know get
the Vitamin C also.

18:29.033 --> 18:30.433
CHIP: And I like
taking my kids along,

18:30.500 --> 18:32.867
so they're not only seeing it,
they're gonna get to pick it,

18:32.933 --> 18:34.667
then they're gonna get
to cook it and eat it.

18:34.733 --> 18:36.700
And that's the whole process
from beginning to end.

18:36.767 --> 18:38.233
But I want 'em to know
where to find 'em.

18:38.300 --> 18:39.733
You find 'em
in these drained areas

18:39.800 --> 18:42.233
right next to the lakes and
creeks and rivers and stuff.

18:42.300 --> 18:43.367
This a good place to do it.

18:43.433 --> 18:45.133
Plus, I hear
lots of geese over here

18:45.200 --> 18:46.700
and I've seen lots of geese
over there so,

18:46.767 --> 18:48.200
I think we might throw
a goose or two

18:48.267 --> 18:50.033
into this meal after a while.

18:50.100 --> 18:51.500
But, erm,
we don't do anything else

18:51.567 --> 18:54.333
until we got enough greens and
the tide comes up a bit more.

18:55.133 --> 18:56.967
There's all different
kinds of, um,

18:57.033 --> 19:00.767
leaves and grasses, and, erm,

19:00.833 --> 19:03.467
other kinds of leaves
that look exactly like these.

19:03.533 --> 19:04.867
But they're not edible,

19:04.933 --> 19:07.633
so we have to really kind
of watch what you pick.

19:07.700 --> 19:09.133
CHIP: Oh, these are minerals
and vitamins

19:09.200 --> 19:10.833
all winter long for us.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.933
It's a lot of roughage
for your guts.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.867
And it tastes good. You know?
Everybody likes a salad.

19:15.933 --> 19:17.200
And we have ways
of storing this.

19:17.267 --> 19:18.733
We boil some of these down
and save 'em in a bucket,

19:18.800 --> 19:21.433
we'll eat a lot of 'em fresh,
and then, erm,

19:21.500 --> 19:23.600
we take the leaves, too,
and we put 'em across the top.

19:23.667 --> 19:25.567
And when the bucket moulds,
the top will mould,

19:25.633 --> 19:27.400
but what's underneath won't,
and we'll peel that off,

19:27.467 --> 19:28.933
throw it away
and start eating.

19:33.700 --> 19:35.100
Let's go back
towards the boat, ladies.

19:35.167 --> 19:37.733
We'll see what we can do
from there, okay?

19:37.800 --> 19:39.233
-AGNES: Yeah.
-It depends on the tide.

19:39.300 --> 19:41.600
Everything depends
on the tide, so...

19:41.667 --> 19:42.900
Yeah, let's go check
on how high

19:42.967 --> 19:44.500
the river's gotten
since we came here.

19:44.567 --> 19:46.200
We might be able
to go further up.

pretty well ravaged this area.

19:52.267 --> 19:55.500
MARTHA: We try to hunt
all the food that we eat.
We prefer it.

19:55.567 --> 19:56.867
You know, to get out,
be active

19:56.933 --> 19:58.900
and be able to harvest
your own meat.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.567
This is the second spot
I wanted to come to.

20:12.933 --> 20:15.367
There's a couple of good coves
or bays in here.

20:15.433 --> 20:17.633
Hopefully, they're holding
some ducks.

guiding fishing clients,

20:24.800 --> 20:26.933
Martha is surveying
Lake Iliamna

20:27.000 --> 20:28.867
for an opportunity
to hunt ducks,

20:28.933 --> 20:31.567
a key food source
during the season.

20:31.633 --> 20:33.933
We're gonna go to this little
bluff right here.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.167
It's a good lookout spot.
See if we can see any birds.

20:48.167 --> 20:49.800
There's nothing out there.

20:50.267 --> 20:51.467
Bummer.

20:54.167 --> 20:58.367
I'm wondering if there's
any in this little... Oh.

20:59.667 --> 21:01.600
There's a swan
sitting over there.

21:01.667 --> 21:04.400
Oh, there's two, three, ducks.

21:05.767 --> 21:07.400
Oh, they look like mallards.

21:08.467 --> 21:09.567
Nice.

21:13.600 --> 21:14.933
Whenever you go out hunting,

21:15.000 --> 21:18.067
you always are optimistic
about bringing an animal back.

21:18.133 --> 21:19.667
I'm gonna see
if I can get a closer look

21:19.733 --> 21:21.200
at these ducks over here.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.900
There's a good little spot
here to look.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.100
All kinds of ducks.

21:38.167 --> 21:40.467
The good thing is,
I don't think they're
fish-eating ducks.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.100
This is a good spot.

21:42.167 --> 21:44.700
Lots of birds. Oh, shoot!

21:46.200 --> 21:48.900
Fuck.
What just scared 'em all away?

21:48.967 --> 21:51.167
The eagle? Mother...

21:52.600 --> 21:55.033
Something spooked them,
I think it was the eagle.

21:57.067 --> 21:58.567
Oh, motherfucker...

22:03.067 --> 22:04.367
While I was looking
at those ducks,

22:04.433 --> 22:06.567
something spooked 'em
which is a bummer.

22:06.633 --> 22:08.700
They all took off
and flew right past me,

22:08.767 --> 22:10.900
but I didn't have my gun.
I left it back there,

22:10.967 --> 22:13.767
so I didn't have to go
through the trees with it.

22:20.067 --> 22:23.533
There's two swans over there.
One disappeared somewhere,

22:23.600 --> 22:26.433
the other one's over there
milling around in the grass.

22:26.500 --> 22:28.467
I'm not looking
for a bird that big,

22:28.533 --> 22:30.233
but I'm also curious
on whether or not

22:30.300 --> 22:31.500
there's a couple more birds

22:31.567 --> 22:34.167
tucked in that little
swampy area over there.

22:34.233 --> 22:36.000
So, go check it out.

22:50.867 --> 22:54.267
Came up on the swans,
they saw us and flew off.

23:07.567 --> 23:09.233
(WHISPERS)

23:16.167 --> 23:18.067
Oh, shoot.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.633
Oh, motherfucker!

23:23.667 --> 23:26.400
We came up on this mallard.
Couldn't tell where he was

23:26.467 --> 23:28.033
'cause there was kind
of a blind spot here,

23:28.100 --> 23:30.133
he was hidden
behind all this grass.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.733
Fuck!

23:31.800 --> 23:34.433
I should have done
that way back there.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.467
I put one in the chamber
and spooked him.

23:36.533 --> 23:38.767
Should have done it
back there.

23:38.833 --> 23:40.967
But, that's hunting.

23:41.633 --> 23:43.100
You can't always get lucky.

23:44.967 --> 23:46.933
There was a bunch
of ducks here.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.100
It was a good spot,

23:48.167 --> 23:50.033
I was just never able
to connect with one.

23:50.100 --> 23:52.300
We're gonna head
to a new place.

23:52.367 --> 23:53.733
I'm still optimistic.

23:59.067 --> 24:00.533
I definitely miss Erik.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.467
We get along really well
and have a lot of fun,

24:02.533 --> 24:03.567
but, er...

24:05.467 --> 24:07.667
It's nice to be able to go out
and do things on your own,

24:09.333 --> 24:11.100
especially on a beautiful day
like this.

24:14.367 --> 24:18.067
So I just came out to these
little islands here
surrounding Rabbit Island.

24:18.133 --> 24:19.867
They're swarming
with seagulls.

24:19.933 --> 24:21.233
I figure
the last ditch effort,

24:21.300 --> 24:22.933
I'm gonna try to get
a couple of seagull eggs

24:23.000 --> 24:25.433
before I go back home,
since I didn't get any ducks.

24:27.300 --> 24:28.767
Weather's getting
pretty nasty,

24:28.833 --> 24:30.500
so I'm not gonna take my time.

24:30.567 --> 24:32.633
See if I can't find some eggs
and motor home.

24:35.767 --> 24:40.467
A seagull nest is usually
in the grass or in the rocks.

24:40.533 --> 24:43.267
Here's a nest,
but there's nothing in it.

24:43.333 --> 24:44.367
Keep looking.

24:49.700 --> 24:53.233
Nice. Two seagull eggs.

24:53.300 --> 24:55.967
Since I didn't bring a basket
or a pail or anything with me,

24:56.033 --> 24:57.433
I'm gonna have
to use my jacket.

24:58.433 --> 25:00.167
Put a little bit
of grass in there.

25:01.267 --> 25:03.567
Growing up, it was always
exciting when summer came.

25:03.633 --> 25:04.933
You knew
that seagull egg-picking

25:05.000 --> 25:06.633
was gonna be
right around the corner.

25:07.300 --> 25:08.533
Found another egg.

25:08.633 --> 25:11.767
There's all different shapes,
sizes, colours.

25:11.833 --> 25:13.767
Pretty exciting, I haven't
gone seagull egg-picking

25:13.833 --> 25:14.967
in a couple of years.

25:15.033 --> 25:16.967
Kind of makes you feel
like a kid again.

25:17.033 --> 25:19.967
Nice. I haven't found one
with three in 'em yet.

25:20.033 --> 25:22.433
I was a little bit
broken-hearted

25:22.500 --> 25:25.033
by not getting any ducks
and bringing them home.

25:25.133 --> 25:26.400
This makes up for it.

25:28.533 --> 25:31.033
So these three make
exactly one dozen eggs.

25:31.600 --> 25:32.633
It's about time
to get out of here

25:32.700 --> 25:34.333
because the wind's
starting to pick up.

25:36.200 --> 25:37.633
I'm happy with what I got.

25:37.700 --> 25:39.500
I'm gonna pull out of here

25:39.567 --> 25:41.067
and go cook
these eggs up at home.

It's a very satisfying
way to live.

25:56.067 --> 25:57.400

to harvesting flightless birds
for protein,

26:00.000 --> 26:01.767
using a native hunting method.

26:04.767 --> 26:07.367
This isha hunt,
the moulting birds hunt,

26:07.433 --> 26:09.700
we just try to get
as much as we can

26:09.767 --> 26:10.967
and carry 'em
all back to the boat

26:11.033 --> 26:13.233
in however much
the girls can chase down,

26:13.300 --> 26:15.967
and we're usually satisfied
with whatever they catch,

26:16.033 --> 26:19.333
and they know how to hunt
without using firearms.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.100
So we don't damage
so much meat,

26:21.167 --> 26:22.733
you know, it's a good hunt.

26:24.167 --> 26:25.800
CHIP: That's all right,
keep your eyes open.

26:25.867 --> 26:27.200
We'll come up across 'em.

26:27.267 --> 26:30.133
We want adult geese,
we don't want baby ducks.

26:33.700 --> 26:34.967
No birds.

You know, people
may not like clubbing,

26:57.900 --> 26:59.933
but we find
it's better than shooting.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.533
When you're hunting 'em and
they're going by overhead

27:01.600 --> 27:02.900
and you hit 'em,
and they're wounded,

27:02.967 --> 27:04.667
they have the potential
to fly for miles,

27:04.733 --> 27:06.433
die somewhere else
and never be used.

27:07.733 --> 27:09.133
When we're clubbin' 'em,
we're right there.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.167
We get 'em or we don't.
We don't wound 'em.

27:11.233 --> 27:13.733
You kill them immediately.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.567
When they're flying overhead
and you shoot 'em,

27:15.633 --> 27:17.300
you hit 'em
right where the meat is.

27:17.367 --> 27:19.800
In the breast, in the chest.
We don't wanna do that either.

27:19.867 --> 27:21.533
We want the meat,
so we hit them in the head.

27:22.933 --> 27:24.100
We waste no meat.

27:24.167 --> 27:26.200
We actually end up killing
fewer geese that way

27:26.267 --> 27:28.100
to get the same amount of meat
that we're lookin' for

27:28.167 --> 27:30.033

They work for me
but I work for them.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.633
What I got here
is I got some plywood,

28:14.100 --> 28:16.367
some rough-cut 2x4s

28:16.433 --> 28:18.067
and I'm gonna start
laying this out.

28:18.133 --> 28:23.067
My goal here
is to be efficient
with my materials, you know,

28:23.133 --> 28:25.267
and try to make my doghouses

out of one sheet of plywood,
per doghouse.

(SAW WHIRRING)

28:31.633 --> 28:32.967
When winter comes,
you gotta constantly

28:33.033 --> 28:35.667
maintain your dogs' houses.
Clean 'em out once a week.

28:35.733 --> 28:38.333
Trying to set the house up
to where it's easy to do that,

28:38.400 --> 28:40.500
very functionable,
I need the door up high,

28:40.567 --> 28:42.000
so the straw stays in there

28:42.067 --> 28:43.633
and they're not
draggin' the straw out.

28:46.933 --> 28:50.000
So to finish that up,
I'll use a hand saw,

28:50.067 --> 28:52.400
that way I can keep a nice,
clean cut.

28:53.700 --> 28:54.867
I got a feelin' that the dogs

28:54.933 --> 28:56.900
are gonna be pretty
excited about this.

28:56.967 --> 28:58.067
This is the time of year

28:58.133 --> 28:59.967
you gotta get everything
done in Alaska,

29:00.033 --> 29:02.500
'cause winter's comin',
you can smell it in the air,

29:02.567 --> 29:06.300
the fireweed's starting
to lose all its flowers
and bloom,

29:06.367 --> 29:09.267
so time's comin',
the dogs gotta have houses,

29:09.333 --> 29:10.633
they gotta be dry.

29:13.367 --> 29:14.467
Okay, what I'm gonna do next

29:14.533 --> 29:16.633
is get my 2x4s
measured out and cut,

29:16.700 --> 29:17.833
and I'm gonna
slap one together

29:17.900 --> 29:19.467
and make sure
my design's sound.

29:19.533 --> 29:22.267
I don't ever really go off
a plan or a blueprint.

29:22.333 --> 29:24.567
I just got it in my mind
what I wanna do,

29:24.633 --> 29:26.467
and it's just playin'
with numbers

29:26.533 --> 29:27.900
and layin' things out.

29:30.900 --> 29:32.767
This has kind of worked.
It's a real good investment,

29:35.233 --> 29:36.267

29:36.333 --> 29:38.100
these doghouses
are gonna cost me money,

29:38.167 --> 29:41.367

of doghouses built,

29:41.433 --> 29:43.100
it's $100, you know?

Big part of being
a dog musher is, you know,

29:47.433 --> 29:48.467
you got all these dogs

29:48.533 --> 29:51.500
and they're very
dependent on you, so...

before your needs
a lot of times,

my house,

a lot in your life.

33:05.233 --> 33:06.833
I don't think you could
go to your local

33:06.900 --> 33:08.667
supermarket today
and buy them.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.700
You gotta go out,
and pick 'em.

33:13.333 --> 33:15.167
Every opportunity
Erik and I get,

33:15.233 --> 33:18.533
we try to harvest
our own meat, eggs, berries,

33:18.600 --> 33:20.433
anything we can get,
we harvest it.

33:25.600 --> 33:28.067
I try to eat as much
of the native food as I can.

33:28.133 --> 33:29.667
That was how
my palate developed,

33:29.733 --> 33:33.767
I ate a lot of seal oil
and frozen fish,

33:33.833 --> 33:36.967
seagull eggs, caribou, moose,
all of that growing up.

33:38.267 --> 33:40.133
That's just what
my body was used to.

33:44.300 --> 33:46.300
So, how was your day
gettin' these eggs?

33:46.367 --> 33:47.667
MARTHA: Good. I had a blast.

33:47.733 --> 33:49.933
Was there as many seagull eggs
as there usually are?

33:50.000 --> 33:52.267
There was quite a bit,
I didn't really go
too far for 'em.

33:52.333 --> 33:54.500
I kind of stayed on this
little patch of islands

33:54.567 --> 33:57.467
that I just kind of hopped
from island to island on.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.600
-ERIK: These are really good.
-Yeah.

33:59.667 --> 34:01.033
ERIK: I really
like seagull eggs.

34:02.367 --> 34:05.233
Today, we made money
from guiding fishermen,

34:05.300 --> 34:08.467
and then we made food from you
collecting these eggs.

34:08.533 --> 34:10.933
Yeah, we're lucky to do
what we do out here.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.067
-We live a very blessed life.
-Mmm-hmm.

34:13.900 --> 34:15.600
ERIK: Alaska will provide.

34:15.667 --> 34:17.133
All you gotta do
is work for it.

34:21.067 --> 34:23.167
SUE: All the good intentions
fly out the window

34:23.233 --> 34:26.900
when old Mother Nature decides
to rule with an iron fist.

34:34.933 --> 34:37.500
NARRATOR: In order to pick up
her weaponry in Fairbanks,

34:37.567 --> 34:39.800
Sue left Kavik in the care
of her nephew, Jesse,

34:39.867 --> 34:41.467
and needs to return home.

34:42.267 --> 34:45.333
SUE: Weather's not good,
but we're gonna try to get in.

34:45.400 --> 34:48.067
We're into a winter weather
pattern up on the north slope.

34:48.133 --> 34:50.733
Caribou have all migrated out
about a month ago,

34:50.800 --> 34:53.267
geese are headin' south,
it's way early.

34:53.333 --> 34:54.867
But the fog bank comes in,

34:54.933 --> 34:56.733
so that's what we're fighting
is the fog.

34:57.967 --> 35:00.433
NARRATOR: The fog
that may prevent her
from landing in Kavik

35:00.500 --> 35:03.200
could also spell danger
for the inexperienced Jesse

35:03.267 --> 35:04.733
on the ground at camp.

35:06.200 --> 35:08.500
This is one
of my pride and joys.

35:08.567 --> 35:10.400
Extremely hard to replace.

35:10.467 --> 35:12.967
Custom thing. Baby it.

35:13.033 --> 35:15.533
I've got 500 miles
to go in land.

35:15.600 --> 35:17.767
If it's not good there,
I can't get in.

35:20.100 --> 35:21.133
PILOT: Clear.

35:22.533 --> 35:24.000
(ENGINE STARTING)

35:28.700 --> 35:30.600
SUE: Just because
you want to go to Kavik,

35:30.667 --> 35:32.267
doesn't mean Mother Nature's
gonna let you.

35:40.500 --> 35:41.700
(PILOT SPEAKS)

35:43.867 --> 35:45.400
(WOMAN ON RADIO SPEAKS)

35:49.600 --> 35:50.767
(PILOT SPEAKS)

35:53.700 --> 35:54.967
Yeah.

35:56.100 --> 35:59.500
So, this is basically
just the fog occlusion

35:59.567 --> 36:01.667
that we were talking about is.

36:01.733 --> 36:03.233
It can be beautiful
everywhere else,

36:03.300 --> 36:05.067
but you get close
to the Arctic Ocean

36:05.133 --> 36:07.533
and that fog bank sets in.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.833
So what's happening,
you got your ground here,

36:09.900 --> 36:13.300
1000 foot higher,
you start your fog bank.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.700
Well, you got
1000 foot of that,

36:15.767 --> 36:18.867
we have to find a place
to come under safely.

36:19.100 --> 36:21.233
It's thick enough
you can't just pop through it,

36:21.300 --> 36:22.633
you can't see through it.

36:22.700 --> 36:26.233
If we can't do that,
bye-bye Kavik,

36:26.300 --> 36:28.000
hello trying to get
into Deadhorse.

36:28.433 --> 36:31.233
I'm 10 miles from Kavik
and I may have to end up

36:31.300 --> 36:33.633
goin' 100 miles that way
and wait it out.

36:36.967 --> 36:38.567
PILOT: Those spots
are definitely getting thinner

36:38.633 --> 36:40.500
as we get closer and closer.

36:42.667 --> 36:44.300
Uh, looks pretty good
over there.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.533
Got a nice clear area.

36:48.067 --> 36:52.233
Come down in elevation,
get underneath the cloud,

36:52.300 --> 36:56.200
so we can go, you know,
twirl down and get in there.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.467
So now we're down into that.

37:10.533 --> 37:12.067
Just put me down here,
I'll walk.

37:12.133 --> 37:13.233
(LAUGHS)

37:18.733 --> 37:20.667
PILOT: Yeah, that was one
of the roughest trips

37:20.733 --> 37:21.933
I've been on this year.

37:23.267 --> 37:24.400
Home sweet home.

37:24.467 --> 37:26.067
Yay, I'm home.

37:26.867 --> 37:28.100
Where's Jesse?

37:29.867 --> 37:31.567
There you are! Come on over.

37:34.700 --> 37:37.167
Cool, man. Finally, got here.

37:37.233 --> 37:39.600
Careful with the wing.
I love ya.

37:42.567 --> 37:44.100
I'm back home.

37:44.167 --> 37:45.833
Yup, yup, yup.
Time to get to work.

37:50.167 --> 37:51.700
Oh, wow. Right over there,

37:51.767 --> 37:53.767
I've got a white wolf
50 yards out.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.167
I got a wolf.

37:58.333 --> 38:00.000
It's time to put
this baby in action.

38:04.400 --> 38:05.600
Right over there.

38:07.733 --> 38:09.733
Yo! Whoa!

38:09.800 --> 38:11.467
Yeah, I'm lookin' at you!

38:11.533 --> 38:13.367
I don't have any desire
to kill it.

38:13.433 --> 38:14.667
It's not attacking me,

38:14.733 --> 38:16.567
I just need him
not to be on my turf.

38:17.633 --> 38:19.667
You need to be gone! Hey!

38:22.367 --> 38:23.900
This is not your camp.

38:25.567 --> 38:26.800
The way the wolves hunt,

38:26.867 --> 38:29.133
they throw the betas out here
to grab your attention,

38:29.200 --> 38:31.667
and it's the alphas back here
that get your back side.

38:33.033 --> 38:35.467
-He's right there.
-(GUNSHOT FIRED)

38:36.733 --> 38:38.100
Fired a shot this way.

38:38.167 --> 38:41.033
Just to make noise
and get that wolf moving.

38:41.733 --> 38:43.667
That's a nice-sized
fuckin' wolf, man.

38:45.467 --> 38:48.100
This just proved its worth.

38:53.833 --> 38:55.800
The only thing you know
for certain out here

38:55.867 --> 38:57.367
is you don't know
nothin' for certain.

38:58.833 --> 39:00.400
But I can protect my turf.

39:04.900 --> 39:06.300
CHIP: What it really
comes down to

39:06.367 --> 39:08.100
is just making sure that our
kids can make a good living

39:08.167 --> 39:09.567
if they choose
to stay up here.

39:14.300 --> 39:16.533
Hey, puppy.
You stay home watchin' camp?

39:16.600 --> 39:18.367
We even got one
for you, puppy.

39:18.433 --> 39:19.500
We sure did.

39:23.033 --> 39:26.500
Wow, we have enough greens
and enough ducks for dinner.

39:28.267 --> 39:29.500
CHIP: You girls wanna
take care of those ducks,

39:29.567 --> 39:31.700
and if your mom wants to clean
up a pot full of greens,

39:31.767 --> 39:33.733
I'll get the alders
fired into here

39:33.800 --> 39:36.000
and we can start up
some dinner, huh?

39:38.833 --> 39:41.000
We like alders and cottonwood
for cooking fires.

39:41.067 --> 39:43.400
They impart a really
nice taste and flavour.

39:43.467 --> 39:46.267
And this fire
was started with stumps.

39:46.333 --> 39:47.600
The stumps are full of pitch,

39:47.667 --> 39:50.300
and if you want your food
to taste like pine pitch,

39:50.367 --> 39:51.600
then cook on it.

39:51.667 --> 39:53.467
I'm gonna let these alders
burn down to coals,

39:53.533 --> 39:54.767
then we'll be able
to roast 'em.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.133
AGNES: Right now,
we're plucking ducks.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.433
What we do is just
take all the feathers off

40:00.500 --> 40:02.533
and cut the wings off,
cut the heads off,

40:02.600 --> 40:03.633
cut the feet off.

40:03.700 --> 40:07.100
I am taking the tail,
the feet,

40:07.167 --> 40:08.967
the wings, and the head off.

40:10.067 --> 40:11.733
CHIP: While the ladies are
taking care of these ducks

40:11.800 --> 40:13.367
and my kids
are hacking and whacking

40:13.433 --> 40:14.933
and guttin' and pluckin',

40:15.000 --> 40:16.200
I'm gonna make sure
that we got

40:16.267 --> 40:17.833
some good, clean greens here.

40:18.833 --> 40:20.000
AGNES: This is a pretty
good hunt.

40:20.067 --> 40:24.100
I'm glad we got chance
to come across these ducks.

40:24.167 --> 40:26.200
We get to eat today
and eat tomorrow.

40:27.500 --> 40:29.167
This is an education
that will teach my kids

40:29.233 --> 40:31.167
to live off the land here,

40:31.233 --> 40:33.500
and happily, with success
and with wealth.

40:34.233 --> 40:36.167
Well, for us,
this is what we work towards.

40:36.233 --> 40:37.367
Instead of getting a paycheck

40:37.433 --> 40:39.100
and then going and buying
food at the store,

40:39.167 --> 40:40.300
we went out and got the ducks.

40:40.367 --> 40:41.633
We went out
and got the greens.

40:41.700 --> 40:43.800
And these, right now,
are the flavour of the season.

40:43.867 --> 40:46.033
These are like having turkey
at Thanksgiving for us.

40:46.100 --> 40:47.767
It's natural, it's healthy,
it's organic.

40:47.833 --> 40:49.433
And we had a great adventure
getting it.

40:54.167 --> 40:55.467
AGNES: A job well done, girls.

40:55.533 --> 40:57.200
We get to eat
what we catch today

40:57.267 --> 41:00.533
and sleep real good,
and start all over again,
tomorrow.

41:00.600 --> 41:02.333
When you all get older
and you can take your kids

41:02.400 --> 41:03.467
to go do the same thing,

41:03.533 --> 41:05.933
and you don't even need
no firearms or nothing.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.033
Need to know where to go

41:07.100 --> 41:09.067
and what time of the year
to go there.

41:09.533 --> 41:11.667
You'll notice
the bird stop flying.

41:11.733 --> 41:13.633
Look in them creeks,
look along them lakes.

41:13.700 --> 41:15.633
You guys did
really good, today.

41:15.700 --> 41:17.433
It was fun to sit back,
watch the boat,

41:17.500 --> 41:19.300
and watch you guys
go pick up the dead ones.

41:19.367 --> 41:20.633
That was a lot of fun.

41:20.700 --> 41:22.267
I'm so proud of you girls.

41:22.333 --> 41:23.400
CHIP: We started out gathering

41:23.467 --> 41:25.100
and we ended up hunting,
didn't we?

41:25.167 --> 41:26.667
Mmm-hmm.

41:26.733 --> 41:27.933
Even the dog's happy.

41:34.867 --> 41:37.267
JESSIE: You can't just look
at the small picture
when you're out here.

41:37.333 --> 41:38.433
Like I have
to like be thinking

41:38.500 --> 41:40.067
four steps ahead,
all the time.

41:46.433 --> 41:48.200
The last piece
for the last doghouse.

41:56.833 --> 41:58.100
Lot of new houses goin',

41:58.167 --> 42:01.100
got some leftover materials
I'm gonna keep

42:01.167 --> 42:03.400
for whenever I do
the next side of the yard.

42:03.467 --> 42:07.267
But this was a big job,
and great to get it done,

42:07.333 --> 42:08.800
see my dogs all have houses.

42:11.233 --> 42:13.367
Let me get your floor
in there for ya.

42:13.433 --> 42:15.700
Yeah, you got yourself
a nice new house, huh?

42:19.733 --> 42:22.667
Check it out, huh?
What you think?

42:22.733 --> 42:24.433
See they're really happy
with the new houses,

42:24.500 --> 42:25.867
jumpin' all over 'em.

42:26.433 --> 42:28.400
Gettin' in 'em, they'll really
appreciate it come wintertime

42:28.467 --> 42:29.933
-when it gets cold.
-(BARKING)

42:30.000 --> 42:31.900
You know, to a lot of people,
this would seem
like hard work,

42:31.967 --> 42:33.733
this is a labour of love
for me, you know.

42:33.800 --> 42:34.967
It's what I do, you know,

42:35.033 --> 42:37.633
I love these dogs
and they depend on me,

42:37.700 --> 42:40.533
so when I work hard and
take care of things they need,

42:40.600 --> 42:43.033
you know, that's
the main thing I'm about.

42:44.267 --> 42:46.200
Feels great to see
all this go towards them.

42:46.267 --> 42:47.767
For 20 bucks
worth of material,

42:47.833 --> 42:50.800
I built a house that other
people sell for $100.

42:50.867 --> 42:52.633
I mean, I can't afford
to do that out here.

42:52.700 --> 42:53.700
That's not what I'm about.

42:53.767 --> 42:55.533
It's a lot of work to do
for one guy,

42:55.600 --> 42:57.567
but, you know,
I like being tired.

42:57.633 --> 42:59.667
I like knowing that I worked
at the end of the day.

42:59.733 --> 43:02.467
So, that's a rewarding
feeling to me, to be tired.

43:03.167 --> 43:04.633
Means I gave everything.
