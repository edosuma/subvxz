I got a whole lot
to tell my book club.

19:04.476 --> 19:05.144
Bye.

19:09.898 --> 19:12.901
- Aw, Paige, sweetie.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.487
Look, I know getting dumped
is hard.

19:15.571 --> 19:18.073
But you'll find a new boyfriend
before you know it.

19:18.156 --> 19:19.366
- What do you mean?

19:19.449 --> 19:21.702
- Well, James dumped you.
That's why you're crying, right?

19:21.785 --> 19:23.912
- No. I'm crying
because the puppy detective

19:23.996 --> 19:26.081
found his father in the pound.

19:26.164 --> 19:28.458
Wait.
James is dumping me?

19:28.542 --> 19:31.503
I thought he just went out
to get nachos.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.380
- Oh, yeah,
that's what he said.

19:35.173 --> 19:38.218
Look, look, look!
They're hugging!

19:38.594 --> 19:40.429
Okay!

19:40.512 --> 19:41.346
You're missing the best part!

19:46.560 --> 19:48.604
- Did you send your stepmom
to dump me?

19:50.522 --> 19:53.692
- James, heads up, Paige is mad.

19:53.775 --> 19:54.985
- James, who is she?

19:55.068 --> 19:56.945
- I'm his girlfriend.
Who are you?

19:57.029 --> 20:00.198
- I'm his girlfriend. Or was.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.366
You can have him.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.285
- I don't want him.
You take him.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.995
- Ladies, let's not fight.

20:05.078 --> 20:07.456
You both can have me.

20:07.539 --> 20:10.167
- That's not the fight
they're having, buddy.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.836
- I'm trying to disarm them
with my charm.

20:19.551 --> 20:20.510
- I hope you learned something

20:20.594 --> 20:22.512
about trying to juggle
two girlfriends.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.685
- Yeah, get two candles
and keep you in the dark.
