00:01.084 --> 00:02.631
<i>Previously on Hit the Floor:</i>

00:02.794 --> 00:04.922
<i>Your boyfriend sleeps
with prostitutes.</i>

00:05.088 --> 00:06.761
You're the anonymous e-mailer?

00:06.924 --> 00:08.767
I was aiming for Jelena. I missed.

00:09.134 --> 00:12.354
Thought what happened to Zero was
brutal, wait till you see

00:12.471 --> 00:14.940
what happens to you
when everyone finds out.

00:15.057 --> 00:17.981
- You set me up.
- You asked me to choose. I chose.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.444
I came to warn you.

00:19.603 --> 00:20.980
Watch your back with Zero.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.856
This apartment, you own it.

00:22.981 --> 00:24.324
I bought it for you.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.658
Connect Oscar to Mia's death.

00:28.779 --> 00:32.079
Need something in Oscar's records
that makes that connection.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.247
We're in this together, okay?

00:34.409 --> 00:37.037
I don't know what I'd do
without you, Jude.

00:37.913 --> 00:39.335
Jude.

00:39.498 --> 00:42.001
The plane's going to leave without you.
Get up.

00:42.167 --> 00:43.510
Pete.

00:58.225 --> 00:59.727
- Thank God.
- Where is he?

00:59.893 --> 01:01.566
In there.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.404
- I can't wake him.
- I know, I know.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.615
He's gonna be okay.

01:08.735 --> 01:12.205
The doctor will be discreet.
I got this.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.463
- Hello?
- The plane's about to take off.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.302
Did you find Pete?

01:25.460 --> 01:29.055
Yeah. He has a bad migraine.
He's not gonna make it.

01:29.464 --> 01:32.559
- Or <i>the</i> game.
- Ahsha, I'm sorry.

01:33.135 --> 01:35.684
I'll cover for him
with the other coaches.

01:35.846 --> 01:37.393
I've gotta go.

01:37.556 --> 01:41.026
Ahsha, where's Pete? He was supposed
to meet me at the airport.

01:41.143 --> 01:42.986
With my mother.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.481
- And the doctor.
- A doctor?

01:45.606 --> 01:48.701
- I found him passed out.
- Excuse me, I'm his wife--

01:48.859 --> 01:50.907
Who let him drink almost to death.

01:51.028 --> 01:52.826
Pete is a grown man.

01:52.946 --> 01:56.621
He does what he wants.
You asked him not to, he still did it.

01:57.534 --> 02:00.583
You knew I asked him to stop
and you still drank with him?

02:02.247 --> 02:06.297
You're toxic. Only reason Pete was with
you is he was drunk and you know it.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.963
- Ahsha--
- I thought you were decent.

02:09.128 --> 02:10.847
I was wrong.

02:11.340 --> 02:13.934
Walk away. Now.

02:14.885 --> 02:17.980
I'm not gonna cause a scene
for his sake.

02:18.138 --> 02:21.563
I understand you're upset,
but you just crossed a line.

02:27.481 --> 02:30.860
Jude, you're 93V-

02:31.401 --> 02:33.153
What? I'm not gay.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.914
- You kissed me.
- No, I didn't.

02:36.073 --> 02:39.794
- Not like that. You were upset. I just--
- Kissed me on the mouth.

02:40.202 --> 02:44.582
Jude, it's cool. You're barking up
the wrong tree, but clearly barking.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.500
I'm not barking at anything.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.419
I gotta get on the plane.

02:48.543 --> 02:51.672
Jude, it's fine. You're gay.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.387
Be 98V-

02:55.509 --> 02:57.511
I'm not gay!

03:04.017 --> 03:05.894
You rang?

03:06.019 --> 03:08.772
I have a little job
I thought you could help me with.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.194
I'm listening.

03:10.315 --> 03:13.034
Our contract with our network
is up this season.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.287
Their bid to re-up is 170 million.

03:15.779 --> 03:18.874
I need someone
to accidentally leak to them

03:19.032 --> 03:21.160
that Time Warner is coming in
at 190.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.834
I love being part of something
with so many zeroes.

03:24.955 --> 03:26.923
One other little request.

03:27.582 --> 03:30.005
I want you to wear a mike
when you do it.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.720
I wanna hear how it goes down.

03:37.968 --> 03:41.393
- How is he?
- He's fine.

03:41.930 --> 03:46.356
Just needs fluids and rest.
I have to stay with him for 24 hours.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.897
I brought soup.

03:50.021 --> 03:52.774
Honey, I told you I'd take care
of Pete.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.818
I know.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.537
It's not for him. It's for you.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.744
I know how much you hate
being here.

03:59.865 --> 04:02.835
You're doing this for me. Thank you.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.667
You wanna stay
and share with me?

04:05.787 --> 04:07.664
It's vegan.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.343
- But sure, why not?
- Good.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.860
<i>- Now, local sports with Chuck Ward.
- Tonight, Phoenix sports news.</i>

04:28.977 --> 04:31.230
<i>The Devils make a bold statement
in game one</i>

04:31.354 --> 04:35.325
<i>with a 102-91 win in Phoenix, despite

06:12.122 --> 06:15.296
You know I was the one
who made Zero's life a living hell.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.800
When is everyone else
going to know?

06:20.046 --> 06:21.389
You worry too much.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.551
Just relax

06:24.718 --> 06:29.189
and enjoy each day
as if it's your last.

06:29.264 --> 06:32.143
Hey, the men needs some more
oiling up. Any volunteers?

06:33.059 --> 06:35.983
- I'll take Derek.
- Yeah, you will.

06:41.192 --> 06:43.240
That's how you celebrate a win.

06:54.789 --> 06:57.133
Hey, why you sitting here?

06:57.250 --> 07:00.220
This is Inside Sports Network.
It's the skin issue.

07:00.337 --> 07:03.011
- Be out there.
- I'm knee-deep in prostitutes.

07:03.173 --> 07:06.598
Naked and greased up isn't the image
I should be going with now.

07:06.760 --> 07:10.264
- Everyone else seems to agree.
- I don't care about everyone else.

07:10.388 --> 07:13.767
Business as usual is exactly the image
you should be going with.

07:13.892 --> 07:16.361
- He's getting in.
- We've already set the shot.

07:16.478 --> 07:19.072
- Unset it.
- We're kind of on a tight schedule.

07:19.230 --> 07:22.575
You better get started then,
unless you want me to pull Derek.

07:27.906 --> 07:30.079
All right, guys,
we're switching the shot.

07:30.492 --> 07:31.789
Get in there.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.455
Sure you're not doing this
to get me naked?

07:37.958 --> 07:39.631
Wanna oil me up?

07:50.679 --> 07:53.148
Sloane, it's Raquel.
I just got to your place.

07:53.264 --> 07:56.188
I'll keep going through Oscar's
records like you asked.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.233
Not sure what you had to do,
but call me if you need me.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.825
Have I apologised enough
for hitting your windshield?

08:07.988 --> 08:09.990
Yeah, that was a crazy accident.

08:10.156 --> 08:14.161
Thank God you weren't sitting in it.
I'd have died if I'd damaged that face.

08:14.285 --> 08:17.414
- All right, you're crowding that ball.
- Oh, dear.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.548
Should I back that thing up?

08:19.666 --> 08:21.088
Well...

08:21.960 --> 08:24.429
You know,
I actually appear on your network.

08:24.546 --> 08:27.265
- I'm a Devil Girl.
- That's why you look familiar.

08:27.340 --> 08:31.061
I love shaking it for your cameras.
I'd hate to go to another network.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.514
Why would you go
to another network?

08:34.639 --> 08:36.732
Well, I was at this private event,

08:36.850 --> 08:40.696
and heard one of Mr. Kinkade's lawyers
tell him Time Warner was after us.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.610
Offered something like 220 million

08:42.731 --> 08:45.951
to show the games. Mr. Kinkade
just about messed his pants.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.320
Two hundred and twenty million?

08:48.486 --> 08:50.659
Maybe it was 220,000.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.078
I'm so bad with money.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.590
Nice. Very good.

09:02.167 --> 09:05.387
- How's Pete?
- He's fine. My mom's with him.

09:05.503 --> 09:09.007
Wait-- Why is your mom
nursing Pete if he just has a migraine?

09:11.301 --> 09:13.474
He didn't have a migraine.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.685
- He drank himself unconscious.
- Are you serious?

09:16.848 --> 09:20.443
I found him at the hotel that night.
I didn't wanna get into it.

09:20.852 --> 09:23.105
- Plus, he's your coach.
- I get it.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.569
Ahsha, I'm sorry.
It must've been really...

09:25.690 --> 09:27.818
Must've been scary
finding him like that.

09:27.942 --> 09:29.910
Don't tell anyone, okay?

09:30.862 --> 09:32.455
I won't.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.372
<i>Hey-</i>

09:44.250 --> 09:46.628
- Hey.
- Hey. What are you doing here?

09:47.087 --> 09:49.840
Damage control.
I just spoke to Oscar.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.259
He understands about Pete
missing the game.

09:52.342 --> 09:55.266
I have to smooth things over
with the rest of the world.

09:55.386 --> 09:58.811
<i>Entertainment Tonight is coming
to do</i> a <i>thing on the Devil Girls.</i>

09:58.932 --> 10:02.232
I thought I'd swing by,
answer any lingering questions.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.320
That's kind of you.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.148
What have you been up to?

10:11.736 --> 10:13.329
Nothing.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.205
Okay.

10:40.682 --> 10:42.810
Are we back together?

10:43.518 --> 10:45.316
I don't know.

10:48.022 --> 10:50.445
<i>I need to get</i> ready
<i>for Entertainment Tonight.</i>

10:50.608 --> 10:54.158
Sloane left me a message saying
she had food poisoning, poor thing.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.656
So I'm in charge.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.454
- I need to go back to the photographer.
- Why?

10:58.616 --> 11:01.961
You think you're the only diva
around here with photo approval?

11:23.349 --> 11:24.726
Excuse me.

11:25.268 --> 11:28.693
Listen, sorry I had to get pushy.
Just looking out for a client.

11:28.855 --> 11:32.359
No, I thought it was cool.
I think that you're cool.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.868
Like, really cool.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.825
- Thanks, I gotta--
- Hey, can I get your number?

11:42.410 --> 11:45.004
I'm not-- I'm not, you know.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.676
One of those. Okay, well.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.424
Just in case.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.848
I'm cool too.

12:10.605 --> 12:12.653
- Hey.
- I think I found something

12:12.774 --> 12:14.526
- that could be something.
- What?

12:14.692 --> 12:16.990
One of the people Oscar called
when Mia died,

12:17.111 --> 12:20.240
that person immediately called
another guy named Tom Zaskan.

12:20.365 --> 12:22.743
I Googled him,
he's a medical examiner.

12:23.201 --> 12:25.954
I requested Mia's autopsy report
weeks ago.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.124
It should be in a green folder
under my laptop.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.717
Foundit

12:32.835 --> 12:34.428
Tom Zaskan.

12:34.587 --> 12:38.888
Oscar had a relationship with the guy
that performed Mia's autopsy?

12:39.175 --> 12:41.394
- Raquel.
- Is this the proof we need?

12:41.552 --> 12:45.307
No, it's not. But connecting
the two of them financially,

12:45.473 --> 12:48.977
showing that he paid the ME off
somehow?

12:49.143 --> 12:51.396
- That would be proof.
- Sloane?

12:53.982 --> 12:57.361
Gonna get into that as soon
as I'm finished with what I'm doing.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.954
- Bye for now.
- Okay, bye.

13:12.542 --> 13:15.295
- Thank you.
- You scared the hell out of Ahsha.

13:15.461 --> 13:18.806
And you dragged me here where
I'm forced to stay and watch you

13:18.923 --> 13:21.927
when I have important things
I could be doing.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.224
I don't know what to say.

13:24.387 --> 13:27.186
That's bull. You have everything
in the world to say.

13:27.265 --> 13:29.939
From what I hear,
you've been spiralling for weeks.

13:30.059 --> 13:33.279
And I refuse to have either Ahsha
or me go through this again.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.569
You're gonna tell me
what your problem is

13:35.690 --> 13:37.784
and we're not gonna leave until you do.

13:44.866 --> 13:46.243
I've been drinking more.

13:47.410 --> 13:50.880
I don't need you to admit it.
I have eyes. I wanna know why.

13:51.414 --> 13:54.008
I got a lot going on, Sloane.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.386
I'm coaching for the first time.

13:56.502 --> 14:00.097
There's so much on the line.
The pressure is unbelievable.

14:00.256 --> 14:04.762
- Then Lionel comes back and Raquel--
- I'm not buying any of this.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.804
And I refuse
to let you blame Lionel

14:06.929 --> 14:10.433
because I am literally staring
at divorce papers signed by Lionel

14:10.600 --> 14:13.604
but not signed by you.
And Raquel was too young for you.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.568
You knew that was infatuation.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.732
Doesn't make the feelings less real.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.201
You're not talking to me
about real feelings.

14:20.318 --> 14:23.822
These are excuses. You're not
digging deep and telling me anything.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.619
Maybe that's as deep as I go.

14:25.740 --> 14:28.994
Then maybe you'll drink yourself
to death. Have fun with that.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.212
Wanna know
what's screwing with my head?

14:31.329 --> 14:36.381
You, all right? You're my trigger. If you
wanna talk, I'm gonna talk about you.

14:36.501 --> 14:37.923
Can you handle that?

14:38.086 --> 14:41.340
I can take anything you throw at me.
You wanna do this?

14:42.173 --> 14:44.016
Let's do this.

14:46.094 --> 14:49.689
<i>- Two hundred and twenty million?
- Maybe it was 220,000.</i>

14:49.806 --> 14:52.025
<i>I'm so bad with money.</i>

14:53.601 --> 14:55.774
- Nice touch.
- Thanks.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.314
Dumb men love dumb women.

14:57.480 --> 15:00.154
Indeed.
Not only did Victor up his bid

15:00.316 --> 15:03.365
but thanks to your good form,
he went up 30 million more

15:03.528 --> 15:04.996
than the figure I gave you.

15:05.154 --> 15:08.749
As a thank you, a few more names
for your little black book.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.501
Thanks.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.004
Just copy this file over here,

15:13.162 --> 15:15.836
wipe this clean and...

15:18.709 --> 15:22.304
- What do we need that for?
- For next time.

15:28.219 --> 15:31.439
The L.A. Devil Girls have ignited
Devils Arena for years

15:31.597 --> 15:33.440
with their amazing routines.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.773
But for the first time,
our cameras are allowed inside

15:36.936 --> 15:38.904
where all the magic happens.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.694
Their rehearsal studio.

15:40.815 --> 15:43.910
And we're just now having our first
big celebrity sighting.

15:43.985 --> 15:47.865
The beautiful, the talented,
the amazing Lionel Davenport.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.704
I'm excited for you to see
what these girls can do.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.707
- They are gonna blow your mind.
- Let's talk about you.

15:53.828 --> 15:56.752
You have a big movie coming out
about the <i>Ecstasy</i> books.

15:56.873 --> 15:59.126
I'm proud of this movie.
I'm proud of Pete.

15:59.250 --> 16:02.345
First season as a coach
and the Devils are in the playoffs.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.089
He missed his first game there.

16:04.213 --> 16:07.717
He made himself sick getting
these guys into this amazing position.

16:07.842 --> 16:10.641
He's just a hell of a guy.
Don't worry, he'll be back.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.809
Now, what's going on
between you two?

16:13.514 --> 16:16.142
We will always be a part
of each other's lives.

16:16.309 --> 16:19.028
That's cute. Give me more.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.570
Okay, fine.
Well, Pete is an amazing guy

16:23.733 --> 16:25.610
but can he do this?

16:25.776 --> 16:29.155
The Los Angeles Devil Girls!

16:30.239 --> 16:32.583
And one, two, three.

18:10.464 --> 18:13.468
Wow, ladies, that was amazing.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.511
Oh, my goodness. And, Jelena,

18:15.678 --> 18:17.772
you've had a tough few days

18:17.930 --> 18:20.649
with this gossip about Zero
and escort services.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.981
You okay? We've been worried
about you.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.604
I'm fine.

18:24.770 --> 18:28.024
This whole thing has taught me a lot
about human nature,

18:28.608 --> 18:32.454
how some people can hurt others
with no remorse

18:33.112 --> 18:34.580
and how far people will go.

18:34.739 --> 18:37.913
- Can I say something?
- Sure.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.203
I forwarded that e-mail.

18:40.369 --> 18:43.873
Jelena's e-mail that got Zero
into trouble.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.462
I'm so sorry.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.964
I did it out of jealousy.
I mean, look at her.

18:48.294 --> 18:51.264
She's got it all,
and she also has a big heart

18:51.380 --> 18:52.973
and didn't deserve that.

18:53.799 --> 18:57.019
I just hope she can be
the better person and forgive me.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.099
Of course.

19:02.433 --> 19:04.686
I can't say I approve,

19:04.852 --> 19:07.571
but forgiving
you would be the noble thing to do.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.612
Thank you.

19:11.359 --> 19:14.112
Well done, ladies. Thank you.

19:16.530 --> 19:19.625
That's what I call an exclusive.
This is gonna air tonight.

19:20.034 --> 19:22.378
You two should watch it together.

19:22.536 --> 19:24.789
Bye, thank you.

19:36.759 --> 19:39.057
Hi. I'm Kendall.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.640
- German.
- Oh, I know.

19:42.807 --> 19:45.686
You're one of the assistant coaches.
The hot one.

19:46.977 --> 19:49.776
- What am I supposed to say to that?
- Thank you?

19:50.731 --> 19:53.780
- Thank you.
- Catching up on paperwork, huh?

19:54.235 --> 19:56.237
Well, it's not all drills and thrills.

19:56.362 --> 19:59.457
Your coach must appreciate
the hell out of you.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.993
It's a shame
that he missed that last game.

20:02.118 --> 20:05.042
He had a migraine. Really?

20:06.163 --> 20:08.712
- Who are you?
- I told you, I'm Kendall.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.218
Who do you work for?

20:11.919 --> 20:14.172
Inside Sports Network.
I'm a researcher.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.388
- No comment.
- Okay, forget Pete.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.976
Derek? How's he feeling? This is where
he tripped up last season.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.564
I have work to do.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.910
Pete, hey, it's me.
Just wanna give you a heads-up.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.700
Make <i>sure you</i> watch
<i>Entertainment Tonight later.</i>

20:42.783 --> 20:44.877
I think you're gonna like
what you see.

20:49.498 --> 20:52.422
You took off. Then you came back,
told me I had a child.

20:52.835 --> 20:54.553
Then you took off again.

20:54.712 --> 20:56.055
We got back together

20:56.213 --> 20:59.308
maybe start to care again,
then you kicked me to the kerb.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.348
Then you get a job inside the arena.

21:01.469 --> 21:04.393
I've got a chance again,
but then you cut that one off.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.015
- You know why.
- I'm fried!

21:06.140 --> 21:08.108
Sloane, you have fried me.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.853
You've jerked me around
like a yo-yo.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.239
Even you being, it's just another jerk.

21:13.397 --> 21:16.071
You won't be with me,
but you won't let me go.

21:16.233 --> 21:17.780
It's torture.

21:17.902 --> 21:20.621
Let me go. Sloane, just let me go.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.659
Or are you just hell-bent
on punishing me forever?

21:36.462 --> 21:40.592
Crap. All of it. This isn't why you spun
out. You may have been pissed off

21:40.758 --> 21:42.760
but you didn't start getting sloshed.

21:42.927 --> 21:45.180
First time I heard
about you getting sloppy

21:45.262 --> 21:48.436
was when Ahsha had to sit with you
in your office.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.485
What happened on that night
that set you off?

21:56.524 --> 21:58.697
That picture of me.

22:02.112 --> 22:04.911
Why did that photo
upset you so much?

22:09.203 --> 22:11.297
I remembered her.

22:12.206 --> 22:14.379
I remembered that girl.

22:14.583 --> 22:17.757
She was so messed up.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.639
Seeing her again, I just--

22:26.846 --> 22:28.723
You just what?

22:32.852 --> 22:34.820
I felt bad.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.284
Why?

22:42.736 --> 22:45.159
She was drowning.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.538
And they let her.

22:50.578 --> 22:53.582
You OD'd shortly after.

22:54.290 --> 22:56.588
You wound up hospitalized.

22:56.750 --> 23:02.348
You know, players,
we get a fancy off-the-radar doctor.

23:02.464 --> 23:03.932
You got a 911 call

23:04.091 --> 23:09.814
and you ended up waking up
in an empty hospital room.

23:12.057 --> 23:15.106
I freaked out. I never came.

23:17.730 --> 23:21.325
Winding up in that hospital
is how I found out I was pregnant.

23:29.408 --> 23:32.457
I let you drown and I did nothing.

23:50.012 --> 23:51.309
Round three.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.782
That's the container of Oxy
you gave me.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.448
I haven't thrown it out yet.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.372
Really?

24:13.702 --> 24:15.704
How about this?

24:29.969 --> 24:31.812
Terrence?

24:33.180 --> 24:35.649
What the hell are you thinking
using this stuff?

24:43.148 --> 24:46.072
- I'm injured.
- Injured how?

24:58.372 --> 25:01.216
You wouldn't have this stuff
if it weren't for me.

25:03.085 --> 25:05.053
For what I did.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.889
Not a day goes by
that I don't think about it.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.931
That I don't hate myself for it.

25:19.935 --> 25:21.528
I'm sorry, Terrence.

25:24.940 --> 25:29.070
I am so, so sorry.

25:40.205 --> 25:41.548
What a turnout.

25:41.707 --> 25:44.130
Best housewarming party ever.

25:44.293 --> 25:46.387
Raise y'all's glasses.

25:46.503 --> 25:48.471
Here's to money.

25:49.631 --> 25:51.224
And friendship and.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.849
Oh, God, just drink.

25:54.011 --> 25:57.140
We know you didn't do what you did
because you were jealous.

25:57.222 --> 25:59.441
Jelena gets under everyone's skin.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.147
From time to time.

26:02.186 --> 26:03.859
- Cheers.
- Oh, you girls.

26:10.527 --> 26:13.622
Why aren't you dressed?
We have the Devils party to get to.

26:13.781 --> 26:17.285
- Everyone's gonna be there.
- Not in a party mood.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.377
Look, this isn't about chips and dip.

26:19.495 --> 26:22.544
This is first step.
Before the public can rally behind you

26:22.623 --> 26:25.092
you need to get back in good
with the players.

26:25.250 --> 26:28.049
You have no friends in the locker room.
You need them.

26:30.631 --> 26:34.306
I'm your agent. You need
to listen to me if we're going to fix this.

26:34.968 --> 26:38.518
You seem antsier than usual.
If I didn't know any better

26:38.680 --> 26:41.650
I'd think you have your own reasons
to get to this party.

26:42.059 --> 26:43.857
I maybe told someone I'd be there.

26:45.646 --> 26:47.114
Who?

26:48.774 --> 26:52.119
Danny, the photographer's assistant
from the shoot.

26:55.239 --> 26:58.288
I don't wanna go to some party
where people are hissing.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.166
Especially if Ahsha's
gonna be there.

27:01.286 --> 27:03.835
She's the one
who brought this whole thing on me.

27:03.997 --> 27:05.920
That's an even bigger reason to go.

27:06.041 --> 27:08.214
For PR's sake,
you have to forgive her too

27:08.377 --> 27:11.051
and going to this party
will only help you.

27:11.213 --> 27:12.931
Forget it.

27:20.806 --> 27:23.730
I don't think I've ever heard you
apologise before.

27:24.852 --> 27:26.604
For anything.

27:26.770 --> 27:29.569
Guess I must think I screwed up
pretty bad then.

27:33.235 --> 27:34.703
I'm ready for one from you.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.741
An apology? For what?

27:40.117 --> 27:42.040
It's no excuse

27:42.202 --> 27:45.251
but part of what pushed me
was the secrets you kept.

27:46.957 --> 27:49.130
You didn't tell me about the trade.

27:49.251 --> 27:51.379
You didn't tell me
about a lot of things.

27:54.047 --> 27:58.974
You know I have trust issues,
and yet still you did it.

27:59.887 --> 28:02.640
I'm not a sidepiece, Terrence.

28:02.806 --> 28:07.027
If you want some brainless chick
to just clap at everything you do,

28:07.311 --> 28:08.904
I'm not the woman for you.

28:12.900 --> 28:15.449
There are things that I don't tell you.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.993
Things that

28:18.697 --> 28:21.667
don't go along with your plans
for the future.

28:21.909 --> 28:23.752
You wanna own this town.

28:23.911 --> 28:25.254
You and me.

28:26.205 --> 28:28.674
But I don't know
if I'm gonna make it.

28:31.627 --> 28:35.507
Baby, my leg is wrecked.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.177
I need surgery.

28:39.843 --> 28:42.938
But I will not sit out
the rest of this season.

28:43.096 --> 28:44.439
I can't.

28:44.598 --> 28:46.976
This could be my only chance
at a ring.

28:53.232 --> 28:56.987
I'm jeopardising my entire career

28:59.112 --> 29:03.162
for just a chance at something.

29:04.451 --> 29:09.082
And I know that flies in the face
of every ambition that you have.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.091
You would fight me

29:13.961 --> 29:15.679
forever.

29:18.840 --> 29:20.513
Okay.

29:23.971 --> 29:25.689
Okay?

29:28.725 --> 29:32.025
Okay, I support you-

29:34.898 --> 29:36.992
If this is what you want.

29:38.235 --> 29:42.365
Even if it could cost me
everything I've ever wanted.

29:42.864 --> 29:44.912
I want it for us.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.913
Okay.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.943
So the Devils have been inspired
by Jelena

30:19.067 --> 30:22.492
- and decided to publicly support me.
- And what about privately?

30:22.654 --> 30:26.158
Privately, I so much as sneeze wrong,
I'm dancing at a theme park.

30:28.285 --> 30:30.834
I've lost my taste
for alcohol these days.

30:30.954 --> 30:33.298
Finding Pete like that,
is tough to get past.

30:33.415 --> 30:36.510
Toughest thing to get past
is him choosing alcohol over me.

30:36.585 --> 30:38.929
I gave him an ultimatum
and it didn't matter.

30:39.046 --> 30:41.174
He chose alcohol
over his own daughter.

30:42.257 --> 30:44.430
For you to have given Pete
an ultimatum

30:44.593 --> 30:46.971
it must have been more
than a one-time thing.

30:47.137 --> 30:49.185
I mean, he missed practise
weeks ago.

30:49.306 --> 30:50.899
He's been drinking this long?

30:52.601 --> 30:54.569
- Yes.
- Well, how could you--?

30:54.728 --> 30:56.981
How could you not have told me
all this time

30:57.105 --> 31:00.075
that it got so bad that you had
to give him an ultimatum?

31:00.192 --> 31:04.493
He's your boss. You need to respect
him, trust him. I didn't want you to--

31:04.654 --> 31:06.577
German covered for him
that practise.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.917
And covered for him in the game
in Phoenix.

31:09.034 --> 31:10.377
Did he know?

31:12.996 --> 31:16.296
I can't believe you'd trust German
with this over me.

31:17.417 --> 31:20.671
Derek. Derek.

31:35.352 --> 31:37.571
Raquel, have you seen--?

31:47.823 --> 31:49.996
I meant what I said.

31:52.994 --> 31:57.841
If you wanna risk your career
for a chance at a ring,

31:58.750 --> 32:00.593
<i>I'll supp0rt Y0“-</i>

32:03.964 --> 32:06.467
But you need to ditch the pills.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.806
I can't do that.

32:09.594 --> 32:13.144
You don't know that the Oxy helps you
other than masking some pain.

32:13.265 --> 32:15.393
- Jelena.
- Terrence.

32:15.559 --> 32:16.981
I know you.

32:18.812 --> 32:22.157
If you do get a ring,
you'll always wonder

32:22.274 --> 32:24.902
if you would've gotten it
without doping.

32:25.694 --> 32:28.664
It'll taint the whole thing for you.

32:30.907 --> 32:33.956
You may have to struggle a little bit
without it,

32:34.119 --> 32:38.499
but you will struggle even more
if you win with it.

32:42.002 --> 32:43.675
All right.

32:47.507 --> 32:49.225
All right.

33:09.571 --> 33:12.495
I wasn't strong enough to save you.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.455
I was always taken care of.

33:14.618 --> 33:18.794
I didn't even know
how to take care of anyone else.

33:19.539 --> 33:21.962
Suddenly you were gone.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.719
Why didn't you run after me?

33:32.260 --> 33:36.436
Sloane, I've made so many mistakes.

33:37.182 --> 33:40.402
But not running after you

33:40.519 --> 33:43.443
when you left was the strongest thing
I did for you.

33:45.649 --> 33:47.822
So much wasted time.

33:49.277 --> 33:51.996
So much damage I can't undo.

33:55.951 --> 33:57.703
I'm sorry.

33:59.079 --> 34:00.672
I'm sorry.

34:01.122 --> 34:03.250
You've done more than you know.

34:29.317 --> 34:31.364
What does she have on you?

34:31.652 --> 34:33.576
You know what this is?

34:37.074 --> 34:38.873
Olivia knew I'm undocumented.

34:39.369 --> 34:41.746
- Undocumented, like--
- I have a fake social,

34:41.871 --> 34:45.670
like if the wrong person found out,
I could be deported without Miguel.

34:46.418 --> 34:50.342
Olivia had something on me that would
have put me in jail for a long time.

34:50.672 --> 34:54.097
She ask you to take her side
against Oscar at the groundbreaking?

34:55.510 --> 34:57.854
I thought Olivia was smarter than that.

34:58.305 --> 35:00.774
Why take her side?
That's man's a cash cow.

35:00.890 --> 35:03.484
Olivia wasn't smart
dragging people into her drama

35:03.602 --> 35:05.354
but she wasn't wrong about Oscar.

35:05.478 --> 35:08.573
He's not just shady, Kyle,
he's a murderer.

35:08.690 --> 35:10.488
- Come again?
- I'm helping someone

35:10.609 --> 35:12.077
look into him and Mia.

35:12.235 --> 35:15.364
- The dancer who jumped?
- Kyle, she didn'tjump.

35:15.655 --> 35:17.498
Sometimes she did things
for Oscar.

35:17.657 --> 35:21.161
He would have her wear a microphone
so he had a record of it.

35:21.328 --> 35:23.080
A microphone?

35:29.294 --> 35:31.888
So Pete was at practise today then?

35:32.756 --> 35:34.099
Oh, hey.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.309
Guess what.

35:39.638 --> 35:43.233
- How'd you hear about this party?
- I have my sources.

35:43.391 --> 35:45.689
Go party with them.
It's time for you to go.

35:45.810 --> 35:49.064
This protective mode you're playing to,
it's intense.

35:49.230 --> 35:51.608
Like sexy intense.

35:51.941 --> 35:53.614
Let's go.

35:59.366 --> 36:01.460
Hey, have you guys seen Jude?
The agent?

36:01.576 --> 36:02.998
No.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.879
Do you have anything else?

36:10.418 --> 36:12.591
You look pretty. Let's go.

36:12.712 --> 36:14.680
While there's still a party to go to.

36:14.798 --> 36:17.893
I'm sure Danny, the photographer's
assistant, will be fine.

36:19.761 --> 36:21.559
Sounds like you're jealous.

36:22.055 --> 36:23.557
Really, Jude?

36:23.723 --> 36:26.351
What's next? You're gonna
double-dog dare me to go?

36:26.476 --> 36:29.821
Do you not wanna go to the party
or do you not want me to go?

36:30.897 --> 36:32.194
No one's stopping you.

36:37.320 --> 36:40.574
If I did kiss you on purpose
in that car,

36:41.032 --> 36:43.205
and I'm not saying I did,

36:44.452 --> 36:46.625
it's not because I was crazy.

36:48.081 --> 36:50.504
It's not because
I was going off of nothing.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.762
Fine. You know what?

36:57.882 --> 36:59.725
Have it your way. Danny is waiting.

37:03.596 --> 37:05.098
You don't even know the guy.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.934
I'm about to.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.605
There you are.

37:45.764 --> 37:49.109
- Shouldn't have run off.
- We're gonna talk shouldn't haves?

37:49.225 --> 37:52.604
How do you think I feel knowing you
had this happen in your life

37:52.729 --> 37:54.823
and you go to a guy
you used to be with?

37:54.939 --> 37:57.863
He happened to be the one who told me
about Pete.

37:57.984 --> 38:00.078
So what?
I'm your boyfriend, not him.

38:00.987 --> 38:04.207
That dude's your go-to
because he's had experience.

38:04.324 --> 38:06.622
I've never done this.
I deserve a chance.

38:06.701 --> 38:08.044
It wasn't like that.

38:08.161 --> 38:10.835
How many times did I ask you
if you were okay?

38:10.955 --> 38:12.707
I mean, you said no more secrets.

38:12.832 --> 38:16.257
You told German your secrets.
All of them. Every one of them.

38:16.377 --> 38:19.426
German's my go-to because
he didn't throw coke in my purse.

38:19.547 --> 38:21.675
And he didn't put me in jail.

38:23.343 --> 38:25.812
- It was an accident.
- What wasn't an accident

38:25.929 --> 38:28.023
is you letting me be punished.

38:28.139 --> 38:31.143
- You didn't have my back.
- I fixed everything.

38:31.267 --> 38:32.894
Obviously you didn't.

38:34.062 --> 38:37.157
I've tried, but I haven't trusted you
since that night.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.659
- And now I don't trust you.
- Yeah.

38:40.443 --> 38:43.196
You know what, you can go to German
all you want now.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.868
I'm done.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.374
<i>Next time on Hit the Floor:</i>

38:50.537 --> 38:52.710
This is everything you left
at my place.

38:52.872 --> 38:56.422
- Cut the bribery, cut to the chase.
- I want scoop on the breakup.

38:56.501 --> 39:00.051
I need a plus one. You free?
Unless you're seeing someone.

39:01.589 --> 39:03.216
What are we doing?

39:03.341 --> 39:05.639
- The ortho doctor.
- I don't wanna see him.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.388
Because there's obviously
a serious problem.

39:08.763 --> 39:12.734
Kyle. You have been a tricky girl
to get alone this week.

39:13.101 --> 39:16.230
Sloane. I wish you hadn't come.
