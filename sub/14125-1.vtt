00:53.925 --> 01:02.500
[Ripped from DVD by funnykiddy]

01:25.540 --> 01:26.609
The Sun!

01:35.140 --> 01:36.778
Wake Up!

01:47.020 --> 01:48.578
Come on, come on, let's go!

01:49.500 --> 01:50.728
Hurry, come on.

01:56.340 --> 01:57.216
Over here!

02:07.500 --> 02:08.615
This way!

02:12.860 --> 02:14.373
Okay, go, go, go!

02:16.220 --> 02:18.575
Jump, very fast!

02:31.780 --> 02:33.532
Hello!

02:33.700 --> 02:34.815
There.

02:59.940 --> 03:01.214
Okay, let's go.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.536
More, more, stop!

03:05.700 --> 03:07.691
Alright, move it out!

03:15.260 --> 03:17.251
Grapes, berries...

03:17.420 --> 03:18.899
Nuts, I don't have any nuts.

03:19.060 --> 03:19.856
Nuts!

03:23.460 --> 03:24.176
Yes!

03:34.740 --> 03:36.298
Let's look at this one here.

03:36.460 --> 03:37.779
Quick, the Sun is coming!

03:37.940 --> 03:40.135
Calm down, boy.
The sun will have to wait.

03:40.300 --> 03:42.370
The radial and the meridian lines

03:42.540 --> 03:45.691
cross and intersect
at the point of force, which is...

03:45.860 --> 03:46.451
right here!

03:56.020 --> 03:57.499
Amazing!

04:01.980 --> 04:02.571
<i>Aspetta!</i>

04:09.740 --> 04:12.618
Ma, what do you call that?
I want fresh fruit!

04:12.780 --> 04:15.055
Barely kissed by da morning dew!
I'm not making jello here!

04:15.220 --> 04:18.017
It's for zee gala dinner!
Da Royal Full Moon Dinner!

04:18.180 --> 04:21.137
I wanna da best, da best, da best!

04:21.300 --> 04:21.891
<i>Capisce?</i>

04:22.060 --> 04:23.573
Yes, the best! Sorry, chef.

04:23.940 --> 04:25.658
Give dat to da ants!

04:26.220 --> 04:27.289
<i>Ma che fai?</i>

04:27.460 --> 04:30.054
Hide da pistils
before a bee sees them!

04:33.580 --> 04:34.569
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

04:38.300 --> 04:39.619
Move it, everybody out!

04:39.780 --> 04:41.816
Everybody out!
Get up there, hurry!

04:42.780 --> 04:43.929
Okay, here we go.

04:44.500 --> 04:45.489
Get ready

04:45.660 --> 04:47.491
Twenty degrees, right.

04:56.540 --> 04:57.131
Fire!

05:08.300 --> 05:10.052
Twenty degrees, left.

05:20.060 --> 05:23.939
<i>We're losing too much time.
Andiamo!</i>

05:29.940 --> 05:31.692
Not that way!

05:32.460 --> 05:34.052
God rest your soul.

06:13.780 --> 06:16.010
I got you,
you little flying nuisance.

06:16.180 --> 06:18.410
Not quite so buzzy-buzzy now,
are you?

06:18.580 --> 06:21.378
Honey, it worked! My honey trap
worked! Check this out!

06:21.540 --> 06:23.770
Where are you?
I can't see you, honey.

06:23.940 --> 06:25.259
Over here! I'm here!

06:26.700 --> 06:28.691
Is the dog okay? Did he get stung?

06:28.860 --> 06:32.296
No, you stepped on his tail.
He'll live. Check this out.

06:32.460 --> 06:35.532
Look at its furry little legs
and that ugly bug-eyed head.

06:36.500 --> 06:37.899
- You scared me!
- Me?

06:38.060 --> 06:40.779
You look like an alien. Will you
take that ridiculous mask off?

06:40.940 --> 06:43.932
The bee can't sting you now.
I have everything under control.

06:45.020 --> 06:45.975
Poor little thing!

06:46.340 --> 06:48.615
It must be suffocating in there,
without any air!

06:48.780 --> 06:52.295
Right! I'll put it out of its misery.
Get the spray.

07:22.700 --> 07:24.770
Nature feeds you every day.

07:24.940 --> 07:27.090
One day, you will feed nature.

07:53.740 --> 07:56.971
I've grown, but I'm still
a lot smaller than you.

08:07.620 --> 08:10.214
Today is a great day because it
marks the end of your initiation.

08:14.740 --> 08:16.253
First, you passed the tree test.

08:32.299 --> 08:35.292
You overcame the boredom
of the first few hours.

08:35.460 --> 08:38.691
You managed to open up
your senses one by one,

08:38.860 --> 08:40.373
and then your heart,

08:40.539 --> 08:44.533
until you were able to hear
the tree's heartbeat.

08:45.460 --> 08:47.371
You heard it breathe.

08:47.540 --> 08:49.496
You heard it laugh.

08:49.780 --> 08:52.578
You became one with the tree.

08:55.460 --> 08:57.815
You even fooled the bird.

08:58.740 --> 09:01.129
The second test was harder,

09:01.300 --> 09:03.052
for you had to gain the acceptance
of the mineral world.

09:12.140 --> 09:15.132
Once more, patience
was the mother of wisdom.

09:15.300 --> 09:18.815
You persevered until the stone
revealed its memory to you,

09:18.980 --> 09:22.973
which is vast for it has been
on Earth since the dawn of time.

09:28.700 --> 09:31.214
That rock saw the birth of mankind.

09:31.380 --> 09:33.940
It saw humanity grow from a worm

09:34.100 --> 09:35.692
and begin to crawl.

10:01.980 --> 10:04.653
The third and final test
was the most important

10:04.820 --> 10:07.334
because it meant reconnecting
with the animal kingdom.

10:22.300 --> 10:25.133
Learning simple actions.
Vital actions.

10:48.300 --> 10:51.975
Actions that unite all these
families, who are so different,

10:52.620 --> 10:55.088
but who have shared the same home

10:55.260 --> 10:57.216
since the dawn of time.

11:00.100 --> 11:03.092
You passed the tests.
You are like the Moon,

11:03.740 --> 11:07.210
full and whole, bright and bold.

11:17.900 --> 11:21.575
You are reconciled with nature.
Protect her and she will protect you.

11:22.180 --> 11:23.169
I will.

11:27.980 --> 11:29.618
I think he's trying
to tell you something.

11:30.420 --> 11:31.773
I think you're right!

11:32.460 --> 11:33.256
Got it!

11:36.100 --> 11:37.294
See?

11:37.620 --> 11:38.416
There's one left!

11:38.580 --> 11:41.299
- I didn't see it.
- Honey.

11:41.460 --> 11:44.054
You know I like animals
and... insects.

11:44.220 --> 11:45.938
It breaks my heart
to kill this bee.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.328
But you heard the Doc!

11:47.500 --> 11:50.697
Arthur is allergic to bees. The
teensiest little sting could be fatal.

11:51.340 --> 11:54.810
Do you want me to risk
our little angel being stung?

11:54.980 --> 11:57.574
No. My baby! I love him so much!

11:57.740 --> 12:00.493
Believe me, this gives me no
pleasure, but it's the only way.

12:00.660 --> 12:02.093
It's the bee or Arthur.

12:16.980 --> 12:18.174
Don't worry, little friend.

12:18.340 --> 12:19.898
I'll get you out.

12:26.660 --> 12:28.457
I'm sorry about this.

12:31.220 --> 12:33.131
I'll make sure
it never happens again.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.614
Go, go!

12:36.100 --> 12:38.614
Come on, hurry. Look alive!
Let's go.

12:38.820 --> 12:40.458
No, no, you first.

12:41.100 --> 12:42.897
Go ahead! Lift up the glass!

12:43.300 --> 12:45.256
It's gone. The bee disappeared.

12:45.420 --> 12:49.299
Unless this one's called Houdini, it's
not about to get out of that glass.

12:49.460 --> 12:52.418
Armand, I swear!
Come look for yourself! It's gone!

12:52.580 --> 12:53.979
I don't believe it!

12:54.300 --> 12:55.699
How did it do that?

12:55.860 --> 12:58.249
Well... They say that honey
gives you energy.

12:58.420 --> 13:01.139
Maybe the bee ate so much
that it raised the glass and...

13:01.300 --> 13:03.768
Rose, please.
If I ate a ton of honey,

13:03.940 --> 13:06.329
do you think I could lift
the house over my head?

13:07.500 --> 13:10.014
There has to be
a logical explanation.

13:10.180 --> 13:12.569
Maybe there's a hole
in the glass... No.

13:12.740 --> 13:15.334
Or maybe he had outside help.

13:17.620 --> 13:19.531
Fingerprints... Bullseye!

13:38.260 --> 13:40.057
- Hello, angel!
- Hi, Granny!

13:40.460 --> 13:43.133
Somebody needs a bath.
Make that two somebodies.

13:43.300 --> 13:44.289
What have you two been doing?

13:44.460 --> 13:46.451
I was being decorated
by the Bogo-Matassalai.

13:46.620 --> 13:48.895
I can see that! Looks like
I have some laundry to do!

13:49.060 --> 13:52.132
- Will you help Grandpa?
- Yes, Ma'am.

13:53.460 --> 13:54.449
Well? How did it go?

13:58.100 --> 14:00.170
Arthur, I am so proud of you.

14:00.860 --> 14:02.737
You truly are my grandson.

14:03.420 --> 14:05.809
Heart to heart, and soul to soul.

14:06.300 --> 14:08.768
- You passed the tests too?
- Well, that was a long time ago.

14:08.940 --> 14:10.578
I was already a grown man.

14:10.740 --> 14:13.618
Being initiated at such a young age
is quite a feat!

14:13.780 --> 14:14.576
Thanks, Grandpa.

14:14.740 --> 14:16.856
- So did you hug a tree?
- For 8 hours!

14:17.020 --> 14:20.569
A red bunting thought I was
part of the tree. It was so cool!

14:20.740 --> 14:23.049
Wonderful!
And which stones did you choose?

14:23.220 --> 14:25.211
The granite boulders
near the little lake!

14:25.380 --> 14:26.495
Excellent choice.

14:26.660 --> 14:28.571
And did you find the beaver's hut
to take a nap in?

14:28.740 --> 14:30.492
No, I couldn't find a beaver,
so I picked a bear.

14:31.060 --> 14:32.209
A bear?

14:32.820 --> 14:34.458
You slept with a bear?

14:36.380 --> 14:38.655
That deserves a real reward!

14:42.740 --> 14:45.095
- It's the Presidential car.
- It's beautiful!

14:45.260 --> 14:46.818
Well, what are you waiting for?
Go try it out!

14:50.980 --> 14:52.254
A bear!

14:55.060 --> 14:57.051
- Hi, Honey!
- Hi, Mom.

14:57.300 --> 14:59.860
How much longer do I have to lie
here with this compress on my head?

15:00.020 --> 15:02.932
Another 5 minutes, honey. That's
what it says on the box! Relax!

15:03.100 --> 15:05.898
Oh, God. How can I relax
with these burns on my face?

15:06.060 --> 15:08.335
At least you know
the spray works!

15:08.500 --> 15:11.651
I'm going to Mrs. Kerman's store
and buying her entire stock.

15:11.820 --> 15:14.254
As soon as I'm back on my feet,
I'll take care

15:14.420 --> 15:16.934
of every creepy-crawly
for miles around!

15:17.100 --> 15:18.215
Go away!

15:19.060 --> 15:20.379
It's dangerous for you here!

15:20.660 --> 15:21.649
What did you say?

15:21.820 --> 15:23.173
Nothing, honey!

15:23.340 --> 15:26.138
I was just thinking out loud.
About... About that bee!

15:26.300 --> 15:28.894
It must be awfully smart
to escape from your trap.

15:29.060 --> 15:30.778
Smart? I don't think so!

15:30.940 --> 15:33.613
Their brains are the size of a pin
head, they're lighter than a feather.

15:33.780 --> 15:35.498
And you expect them
to be able to think?

15:35.660 --> 15:38.697
The human brain weighs
over two pounds. Think about it!

15:38.860 --> 15:41.658
It takes one heck of a brain
to invent...

15:42.020 --> 15:45.456
the telephone, for example,
or the television.

15:45.620 --> 15:47.212
Even if we don't have one!

15:47.860 --> 15:50.977
And the automobile! Did a spider
invent the automobile?

15:51.140 --> 15:54.212
Did bees paint the Sixtine Chapel?

15:54.380 --> 15:57.611
Did mosquitoes sculpt
Rodin's Thinker? I think not!

15:57.780 --> 16:01.455
And poetry and music? You think
any beetle ever wrote music?

16:01.740 --> 16:02.934
No, of course not!

16:03.100 --> 16:05.455
Not to mention architecture!
The Empire State Building...

16:05.620 --> 16:09.613
The Golden Gate Bridge! You think
a bunch of ants could build a bridge?

16:14.780 --> 16:17.977
First class passengers...
All aboard!

16:28.660 --> 16:32.050
Platform number one!
The train is about to depart!

16:33.740 --> 16:35.537
Stand clear, please!

16:36.660 --> 16:37.376
Hey, Mom.

16:37.700 --> 16:38.530
What's up?

16:38.700 --> 16:40.179
- You tell me.
- Nothing.

16:40.340 --> 16:42.058
- Just playing.
- Really?

16:42.220 --> 16:45.451
- Grandpa gave me a new train.
- Let me see!

16:48.300 --> 16:51.212
- What are you doing?
- Checking for illegal immigrants.

16:53.340 --> 16:55.058
Like I have something to hide!

17:01.740 --> 17:05.368
I know you let the bee go free.
You're allergic to it, remember?

17:05.540 --> 17:06.733
I know, Mom,

17:06.940 --> 17:10.250
but if you were caught in a trap
like that, I'd rescue you.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.251
That's very sweet of you, honey.

17:12.420 --> 17:14.297
But that bee stung your father.

17:14.460 --> 17:17.577
- A sting won't kill him.
- Hopefully not.

17:17.740 --> 17:19.570
Come mon. Time to take a shower.

17:21.500 --> 17:22.979
Bright as a new penny.

17:24.859 --> 17:26.656
Don't go rolling in the dirt now.

18:11.220 --> 18:12.414
Got you now.

18:12.580 --> 18:14.298
You think honey is sweet?

18:14.460 --> 18:16.655
Have you ever tasted revenge?

18:21.060 --> 18:22.049
Just right.

18:24.540 --> 18:25.859
You scared me!

18:29.380 --> 18:32.417
Could you move to one side a little?
You're in the line of fire.

18:32.580 --> 18:36.414
This tree is 200 years old. It saw
your grandfather come into the world.

18:36.580 --> 18:40.016
If it offers refuge to a beehive,
it must have its reasons for doing so.

18:40.260 --> 18:44.412
I'm sorry, but there isn't a tree in
the world that has authority over me.

18:44.580 --> 18:46.889
I own this tree.
It's on my land.

18:47.060 --> 18:48.493
So get out of my way.

18:48.860 --> 18:50.851
My land. My tree. My rock.

18:51.180 --> 18:53.648
No. That is my rock.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.209
Your rock...

18:57.540 --> 18:58.814
Well... Maybe so.

19:00.300 --> 19:03.258
But those bees have it coming
to them. I will be back.

19:09.180 --> 19:11.694
Look at that!
You still have paint on your face.

19:12.020 --> 19:14.853
I don't want you to playing
any more war games. War isn't nice.

19:15.020 --> 19:16.339
It's not warpaint, Mom.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.456
These are the eternal
codes of nature.

19:18.620 --> 19:21.532
I was accepted into the great circle
today. Tonight there's a big party.

19:21.700 --> 19:22.689
That's nice, dear.

19:22.860 --> 19:26.057
It's the tenth moon. The Minimoys
are preparing a feast in my honor.

19:26.220 --> 19:27.653
The Mini... Mini what?

19:28.180 --> 19:29.454
The Minimoys.

19:29.620 --> 19:32.259
They'll all be there
and I'll get to see Selenia again.

19:32.740 --> 19:34.059
Where exactly is this party?

19:34.500 --> 19:35.455
In the garden.

19:36.460 --> 19:38.690
As long as you stay in the garden,
you can go wherever you want.

19:39.180 --> 19:40.056
Good.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.338
Fire department, please.

19:50.060 --> 19:51.049
You scared me!

19:51.260 --> 19:54.411
- Have you looked in the mirror lately?
- I got stung by a bee!

19:54.620 --> 19:57.930
He must be using steroids. You look
like you've been stung 100 times.

19:58.100 --> 19:59.931
It got me once. In the rear.

20:00.100 --> 20:01.249
Call you back.

20:01.420 --> 20:04.093
My face... That was your daughter
with the spray.

20:04.260 --> 20:06.854
- Is the bee still alive?
- Unfortunately, yes.

20:07.020 --> 20:08.533
It escaped death this once.

20:08.700 --> 20:11.419
But not for long.
I found the hive in the forest.

20:12.380 --> 20:14.177
My dear Armand,

20:14.780 --> 20:18.568
even though my home is your home,
it is still my home.

20:18.740 --> 20:22.096
And when I say my home, I mean this
house and the magnificient gardens.

20:22.260 --> 20:25.457
That includes the trees and plants
that are kind enough to grow here,

20:25.620 --> 20:28.373
and all the animals and insects
that honor us with their presence.

20:28.540 --> 20:31.213
Including the bees.

20:32.500 --> 20:33.296
Okay.

20:35.580 --> 20:36.979
And one more thing, Arthur.

20:37.260 --> 20:38.739
Who is this Selenia?

20:39.140 --> 20:40.971
- She's a princess.
- Really?

20:42.260 --> 20:43.375
What's this princess like?

20:43.620 --> 20:47.056
She's brave, she's smart
and she's never scared.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.093
Except of water.

20:49.380 --> 20:50.256
What does she look like?

20:51.380 --> 20:55.089
She has brown eyes
and red hair,

20:55.460 --> 20:57.098
like a setting sun.

20:57.740 --> 20:59.253
And when she smiles...

20:59.500 --> 21:00.933
she looks like...

21:01.780 --> 21:02.735
an angel.

21:03.820 --> 21:06.573
Any chance you might have
a teensy weensy crush on her?

21:07.100 --> 21:09.489
No, Mom, don't be silly.
She's way too old for me.

21:09.660 --> 21:10.854
She's over a thousand years old!

21:12.020 --> 21:14.534
Oh, God, you're right!
That is too old for you!

21:14.820 --> 21:17.812
I don't think you should see
anyone over five hundred!

21:20.020 --> 21:21.897
Honey, pack your bags,
we're leaving tonight.

21:22.060 --> 21:24.176
But, Dad! We're supposed
to be leaving tomorrow.

21:24.660 --> 21:27.697
Change of plans. It will be easier
tonight. Less traffic. And cooler.

21:27.860 --> 21:29.498
We can't leave tonight!

21:29.660 --> 21:31.059
- Oh, and why's that?
- Because...

21:33.780 --> 21:35.338
Because it's the tenth moon!

21:35.500 --> 21:38.014
And what happens on the tenth moon?
You turn into a werewolf?

21:38.180 --> 21:40.455
Do not say things like that!
You know how superstitious I am!

21:40.900 --> 21:44.336
God! Arthur, you've been gazing
at the moon for the past two months.

21:44.500 --> 21:46.092
It's time you come down to Earth.

21:46.260 --> 21:49.696
If my maths are as good as yours,
you're starting school in two days.

21:52.180 --> 21:54.569
Mom, please! I'll do whatever
you want for the whole year.

21:54.740 --> 21:56.139
I'll be the best son
in the whole wide world.

21:56.300 --> 21:59.531
I've been waiting for this moment
for months. I can't leave now.

21:59.700 --> 22:03.579
Just a few hours! A few minutes.
I have to see her.

22:04.980 --> 22:06.049
Honey!

22:08.860 --> 22:11.215
Armand, honey? It is a bit rushed.

22:11.380 --> 22:12.699
Besides, it would be rude
to leave now.

22:12.860 --> 22:16.250
My mother spent all day cooking
our dinner. And my father...

22:16.420 --> 22:19.571
Don't get me started on your father!
He thinks...

22:20.460 --> 22:24.248
He thinks his precious garden is more
important than his grandson's life!

22:24.980 --> 22:26.936
Arthur, come on!
Get dressed and pack your bags.

22:27.100 --> 22:28.419
I'll be waiting in the car.

22:32.940 --> 22:33.929
I'm sorry.

22:42.220 --> 22:45.929
I packed it all up for you. You
just have to heat it up in the oven.

22:46.100 --> 22:48.091
- And some fresh eggs.
- Thank you.

22:48.860 --> 22:51.693
I'm sorry, Mom.
You know how Armand is.

22:51.860 --> 22:53.134
He's always in a rush.

22:53.300 --> 22:55.939
- I know. Can I get you anything else?
- Yes.

22:56.100 --> 22:57.931
A handkerchief, maybe?

22:58.340 --> 23:00.217
Of course. Here you go

23:13.820 --> 23:15.651
I'll miss you too, Alfred.

23:37.940 --> 23:39.658
I'll be back at Christmas.

23:39.940 --> 23:43.250
If there's snow we can play Eskimos.
You can be White Fang! How about it?

23:45.500 --> 23:48.173
Alfred?
I can't play with you right now.

23:49.660 --> 23:51.013
Don't you understand?

23:51.500 --> 23:52.774
I'm leaving!

23:58.620 --> 24:01.088
What is it? What do you see?

24:04.260 --> 24:06.057
Is that why you were barking?

24:06.220 --> 24:07.778
It's just a spider...

24:08.700 --> 24:10.930
that's carrying something?

24:15.580 --> 24:16.808
Thanks.

24:24.180 --> 24:25.659
A grain of rice...

24:26.620 --> 24:28.497
with some sort of inscription on it.

24:38.780 --> 24:40.259
Oh my God.

24:48.740 --> 24:51.857
Grandpa! I've received a message.
The Minimoys are in danger!

24:52.020 --> 24:53.499
Calm down, Arthur!
What message?

24:53.660 --> 24:56.220
Here, on this grain of rice!
A spider gave it to me.

24:56.380 --> 24:59.338
Usually, the Minimoys send messages
on leaves they drop from trees.

24:59.500 --> 25:01.491
I know, but...
Read it, Grandpa! Please!

25:01.660 --> 25:02.888
Sorry, yes, of course...

25:05.220 --> 25:07.495
Hurry up, son! It's late
and we have a long drive ahead of us.

25:07.980 --> 25:09.777
I was just...
saying goodbye to Grandpa.

25:10.300 --> 25:11.096
Sure.

25:12.660 --> 25:14.332
The message on the grain
of rice reads...

25:15.060 --> 25:16.049
"Help!"

25:17.220 --> 25:18.369
Are you sure?

25:18.780 --> 25:19.451
Positive.

25:19.620 --> 25:22.088
But I can't do anything.
Only you can save them now!

25:22.260 --> 25:24.569
That won't be very easy.
But I'll see what I can do.

25:24.740 --> 25:27.493
Okay, Arthur, I think that's
enough good-byes, don't you?

25:39.420 --> 25:42.492
Let's see if we can make it back
faster than we came.

25:52.740 --> 25:54.219
Take it easy.

26:05.460 --> 26:09.692
Leave him. He'll be back.
He's scared of the dark.

26:10.180 --> 26:12.296
It's not the dog I'm worried about.

26:19.180 --> 26:20.056
You see?

26:20.220 --> 26:21.255
Arthur was right!

26:21.420 --> 26:23.251
That boy has an overdeveloped
imagination.

26:23.420 --> 26:25.695
He'd do anything
to see his Princess,

26:25.860 --> 26:29.535
even if it means making up a story
about a message on a grain of rice.

26:29.700 --> 26:33.090
Wasn't it you who told me that
Minimoys only communicate by leaves?

26:33.260 --> 26:34.978
Yes, but this is an emergency.

26:35.140 --> 26:38.052
They had to find something smaller
so a spider could carry it.

26:38.220 --> 26:39.619
You two make a fine pair!

26:39.780 --> 26:42.010
Remind me again, which one of you
is 12 years old?

26:42.180 --> 26:43.169
Daisy!

26:43.980 --> 26:48.053
This is no laughing matter. Maybe
the Minimoys are in real danger!

26:48.220 --> 26:51.212
And I can't just sit around twiddling
my thumbs. I have to help them!

26:51.380 --> 26:53.769
The Minimoys
are thousands of years old.

26:53.940 --> 26:56.215
They have survived
countless catastrophes.

26:56.380 --> 26:59.975
I'm not a thousand years old.
I'm not gonna live forever.

27:00.140 --> 27:01.937
And I don't want to lose you again.

27:05.100 --> 27:06.374
Did you hear that?

27:07.020 --> 27:08.248
Shit! It's gonna pour!

27:08.420 --> 27:10.172
I think we should stop
at a gas station.

27:10.340 --> 27:11.773
We should stay ahead of the storm.

27:11.940 --> 27:15.774
I need to stop! I don't have any bags
left in case Arthur doesn't feel well.

27:17.060 --> 27:18.129
Oh, alright. I see.

27:18.660 --> 27:21.413
I'll pull over.
Five minutes, okay? No more.

27:35.500 --> 27:37.411
Might as well check the oil.

27:41.500 --> 27:44.298
I need to use your bathroom,
thank you.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.060
It's alright, we don't need
any gas, thank you!

27:59.500 --> 28:02.617
It feels good to have everything
under control again.

28:17.140 --> 28:20.018
You've just saved my life
and I'll be eternally grateful!

28:22.460 --> 28:23.449
Everything alright, Rose?

28:24.820 --> 28:25.855
Good.

28:30.380 --> 28:32.098
I feel much better.

28:32.540 --> 28:35.134
Look at that! He fell asleep.

28:35.300 --> 28:38.417
Good, it won't seem
such a long drive for him then!

29:05.980 --> 29:07.049
Oh my God!

29:07.660 --> 29:09.252
Arthur was right.

29:13.580 --> 29:16.299
Arthur? What are you doing here?
Did you have an accident?

29:17.020 --> 29:19.011
- I ran away!
- You ran away?

29:19.180 --> 29:22.889
You can't do that! Where are
your parents? Where's anybody?

29:23.060 --> 29:25.449
There's not a minute to lose!
The Bogos are ready.

29:25.620 --> 29:28.259
- I need the telescope.
- The telescope?

29:32.060 --> 29:33.379
The telescope, of course!

29:53.900 --> 29:56.414
Three quarter-turns to the left
for the body.

29:57.020 --> 29:59.329
Three quarter-turns to the right
for the mind.

30:00.020 --> 30:02.580
And one whole turn for the soul.

30:08.660 --> 30:10.855
Not now! Please.

30:20.140 --> 30:21.459
I don't believe it!

30:22.020 --> 30:25.376
Arthur, I'm so sorry,
but the sky has decided.

30:25.540 --> 30:27.656
Now the Minimoys will have
to deal with this on their own.

30:27.820 --> 30:30.095
Do you think they'd call for help
if they could handle it on their own?

30:30.260 --> 30:33.138
They're in huge danger, Grandpa!
They need us!

30:34.740 --> 30:37.459
Is the lightbeam the only way to join
them? Is there any another way?

30:37.620 --> 30:38.939
You know, for emergencies?

30:39.100 --> 30:43.093
- There are the vines...
- Perfect! What do I have to do?

30:43.260 --> 30:46.172
Arthur, the vines are a terribly
dangerous way of passing through.

30:46.340 --> 30:49.537
It's the method our ancestors used
before the telescope was invented.

30:49.700 --> 30:51.099
A lot of them died trying it.

30:51.260 --> 30:55.094
If something happens to Selenia,
I'll die anyway!

30:55.260 --> 30:56.329
Of a broken heart!

30:56.500 --> 30:59.412
I have to find a way to make
it through! I'm their only hope!

30:59.580 --> 31:02.174
I know, Arthur,
but you're still such a young boy.

31:02.900 --> 31:03.776
Look!

31:04.500 --> 31:05.774
Have faith in me, Grandpa.

31:05.940 --> 31:07.578
I'll make it back.

31:10.260 --> 31:11.136
I'm ready.

31:22.340 --> 31:24.092
Once you're in the vines,
there's no going back.

31:24.260 --> 31:27.457
You'll have to see it through,
however painful it gets.

31:27.620 --> 31:29.258
Don't worry about me.

31:29.420 --> 31:31.012
Look after Grandma.

31:31.180 --> 31:32.056
I will.

32:07.820 --> 32:10.812
Nature belongs to you,
you belong to nature.

32:20.660 --> 32:21.490
Now! Pull!

32:24.900 --> 32:26.015
And pull!

32:27.780 --> 32:29.577
Hurry, harder!

32:33.220 --> 32:34.016
Again!

32:34.180 --> 32:37.092
- Please, stop!
- We can't stop now!

32:37.260 --> 32:38.215
Granpa! Stop!

32:39.220 --> 32:40.289
Pull harder!

32:41.700 --> 32:43.019
Again, harder!

32:43.620 --> 32:44.655
It hurts!

32:44.820 --> 32:46.697
Pull harder! Pull!

32:46.860 --> 32:48.976
We have to get all the water
out of his body!

32:49.700 --> 32:50.689
And pull again!

32:52.740 --> 32:53.536
Harder!

32:57.900 --> 33:00.255
We're almost there! Pull again!

33:05.260 --> 33:06.659
Stop!

33:52.620 --> 33:53.848
Did he make it?

33:54.020 --> 33:56.250
Yes, I think so. It's up to him now.

33:56.420 --> 33:57.535
How will he make it back?

33:57.700 --> 33:59.975
Tomorrow the light beam
will open the passage back this way.

34:00.140 --> 34:02.256
- He must not miss it.
- And if he does?

34:02.420 --> 34:04.650
If he does,
he will have to wait ten moons.

34:11.500 --> 34:13.570
Rose! What's the matter?
What are you screaming about?

34:13.739 --> 34:16.300
There! Look! Arthur!
He turned into a wolf. You see?

34:16.460 --> 34:18.451
I told you not to joke about that!

34:22.980 --> 34:24.254
Rose, it's Alfred!

34:25.900 --> 34:28.130
Of course.

34:28.900 --> 34:29.889
I'm sorry.

34:30.060 --> 34:33.973
It's my fault. I shouldn't have
told you all those werewolf stories.

34:34.500 --> 34:38.732
I feel so silly now.
Thinking Arthur could turn into a...

34:49.060 --> 34:51.699
Oh my God! That was some fall!

34:57.340 --> 34:57.977
Hi.

35:02.300 --> 35:04.177
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.

35:04.340 --> 35:05.250
Please, wait!

35:05.420 --> 35:08.173
Who have we got here? The little
prince got itchy feet again?

35:08.340 --> 35:11.412
You shoulda called ahead,
I'd have put you on the list.

35:11.580 --> 35:13.172
That way, you coulda came in
through the door!

35:13.340 --> 35:15.979
Jack! Fill 'em up.
This one's on me!

35:16.580 --> 35:17.330
Hi, Jack.

35:19.380 --> 35:20.608
Cheers!

35:20.780 --> 35:22.930
Here's to your dazzling return!

35:24.100 --> 35:25.977
Max, I don't have time for drinks.

35:26.140 --> 35:28.370
I received a message.
The Minimoys are in danger.

35:28.540 --> 35:31.657
Tell me something I don't know.
Life ain't easy when you're 2 mm tall.

35:31.820 --> 35:33.970
Life isn't easy when you're
5 foot tall, believe me.

35:34.140 --> 35:37.769
So, let's drink to now and may it
last forever and ever!

35:39.940 --> 35:42.249
I have to get to the Minimoy's
village as fast as I can,

35:42.420 --> 35:43.330
and I need your help!

35:44.020 --> 35:47.330
Can't you just come into my club,
kick back, chill out, have a drink

35:47.500 --> 35:49.809
and shake your booty
like everybody else?

35:49.980 --> 35:53.052
Max! Selenia is in danger!
Please! Help me!

35:53.860 --> 35:55.930
Lordy Lord! You and your princess!

35:56.100 --> 35:58.056
C'mon, follow me!

36:05.900 --> 36:08.892
There have been big changes
round here since you left.

36:09.060 --> 36:11.574
There's a new head honcho.
His name's Kröb.

36:11.740 --> 36:15.210
He's such a nasty piece of work, he
makes people nostalgic for Maltazard.

36:15.380 --> 36:16.335
Sometimes.

36:16.500 --> 36:18.218
Maybe he's threatening the village?

36:18.380 --> 36:20.132
And that's why the Minimoys
called me.

36:20.300 --> 36:22.689
I don't think so.
Kröb's a woodlouse!

36:22.860 --> 36:24.816
He's a couch potato,
he never leaves his hole!

36:24.980 --> 36:27.733
He has an army of unicorns working
for him, keeping everything tight.

36:27.900 --> 36:28.889
What do you mean?

36:29.060 --> 36:32.052
The seventh kingdom is locked down,
dude. It's a full-on ghetto.

36:32.220 --> 36:34.211
Nobody gets in or out
without his permission.

36:34.380 --> 36:37.258
I don't have time for bureaucracy.
We'll have to find another way.

36:37.420 --> 36:38.136
Chill, cuz.

36:38.300 --> 36:41.178
First, we'll head into town,
find out what's going down.

36:46.140 --> 36:49.018
If the Minimoys are in any kind
of danger, we'll soon know.

36:49.180 --> 36:50.215
But in town they won't stop us?

36:50.380 --> 36:53.850
The unicorns are everywhere
but they leave us alone.

36:54.740 --> 36:57.208
- How come?
- The Koolomassai put on all the shows

36:57.380 --> 36:58.574
and keep the whole place going.

36:58.980 --> 37:01.335
Ain't no business like show business!

37:23.660 --> 37:25.730
- That's wassup.
- Cool!

37:36.820 --> 37:37.855
Wassup?

37:43.860 --> 37:46.454
- I shouldn't have been tough on him.
- You were just trying to protect him.

37:46.620 --> 37:48.099
Honey, slow down.
I don't feel too good.

37:48.260 --> 37:50.694
I should have listened to him,
taken his feelings into account.

37:50.860 --> 37:54.614
- I feel nauseous. Honey, slow down.
- We have to get back there fast!

37:54.780 --> 37:56.611
Weird things can happen
when there's a full moon.

37:59.100 --> 38:00.089
My little boy!

38:00.260 --> 38:02.569
I love him so much! You know
how much I love him, don't you?

38:02.860 --> 38:06.569
Of course, honey. But slow down
or we're going to have an accident.

38:08.660 --> 38:10.218
An accident? Oh my gosh.

38:10.380 --> 38:12.132
If anything were to happen to him,
I'd never forgive myself!

38:12.860 --> 38:15.738
What are they doing out so late?
They should be asleep!

38:15.900 --> 38:17.094
- Honey, hit the brakes.
- What?

38:17.260 --> 38:17.851
Hit the brakes!

38:20.140 --> 38:21.050
He's not budging!

38:30.900 --> 38:33.095
So sorry! I was going too fast.

38:33.260 --> 38:34.329
It's all my fault.

38:34.780 --> 38:35.974
Sorry.

38:38.220 --> 38:39.892
See? I told you!

38:45.460 --> 38:46.973
Yo, man.

39:01.060 --> 39:03.051
Yeah, nice. My hood.

39:15.900 --> 39:16.889
Hi.

39:19.260 --> 39:21.569
Cool out. We're safe now.
I'm the king here!

39:21.740 --> 39:23.298
- All you gotta do is look chill.
- How come?

39:23.460 --> 39:26.816
Best way not to get noticed round here
is to make sure everybody notices you.

39:26.980 --> 39:28.698
- That's a weird concept.
- Sure!

39:28.860 --> 39:30.691
We call it cruising.

39:31.020 --> 39:32.772
Go slow, arm out the window,

39:32.940 --> 39:35.659
look like you're miles away
and just laugh.

39:35.820 --> 39:37.412
Okay. What are you laughing at?

39:37.580 --> 39:40.777
That's not the point. So long as
everybody thinks they missed the joke.

39:40.940 --> 39:42.612
- Dig?
- Not really.

39:43.540 --> 39:44.814
Well, check this!

39:51.060 --> 39:52.732
- What's he laughing at?
- Dunno.

39:52.900 --> 39:55.050
- Anybody get the joke?
- No.

39:55.940 --> 39:56.816
Bummer!

39:57.820 --> 39:59.139
You, try!

40:04.540 --> 40:07.657
What's he laughing at?
I got something on my face?

40:07.820 --> 40:10.937
Let's see... you got a big horn
right in the middle of your forehead.

40:11.540 --> 40:12.529
Idiots!

40:19.500 --> 40:21.809
I never thought so much was going on
right under the house.

40:22.300 --> 40:26.009
Last year it was just a backwater
for retired beetles.

40:26.460 --> 40:28.178
And then there was the great harvest

40:28.340 --> 40:30.376
and everybody got stupid rich.

40:30.540 --> 40:33.691
So the Koolomassai opened a couple
of bars to attract some artsy types

40:33.860 --> 40:36.055
and a smooth operator started
a glow-worm business.

40:36.540 --> 40:37.529
In nothin' flat,

40:37.700 --> 40:41.295
this sleazy hole became
a city of lights open 24/7,

40:41.460 --> 40:42.859
where you can find

40:43.020 --> 40:45.329
anything you need.

40:52.180 --> 40:54.330
I love this town!

41:00.420 --> 41:01.569
Let's roll.

41:04.300 --> 41:07.258
- What can we do for you?
- Well, I actually...

41:07.420 --> 41:09.012
Some advice, perhaps?

41:09.180 --> 41:10.215
To tell the truth...

41:10.380 --> 41:13.656
I can read your future
in the lines of your hand.

41:13.820 --> 41:15.412
- Tell me what you want to hear.
- I don't know...

41:15.580 --> 41:17.536
Beat it, all of you!

41:17.780 --> 41:20.419
Don't listen to this bunch
of phonies and roaches!

41:20.580 --> 41:22.969
I am not a roach!
I'm a weather mantis

41:23.140 --> 41:25.290
and I can predict the temperature
to the nearest degree.

41:27.300 --> 41:30.929
We got to find my cousin, Replay.
He's the only guy I totally trust.

41:41.500 --> 41:42.615
Replay!

41:42.780 --> 41:44.850
Hey, buddy, you dropped your wallet.

41:45.020 --> 41:46.499
No, thank me!

41:46.660 --> 41:48.855
But you better be careful
round here because...

41:50.380 --> 41:52.098
- Hey, cuz!
- Hey!

42:03.700 --> 42:05.179
Guys, can we cut it short?

42:06.060 --> 42:08.938
- Your chandelier got all broke up.
- I know.

42:09.100 --> 42:11.455
I know a silkworm who'll fix it
for you in 24 hours.

42:11.620 --> 42:12.291
I know.

42:12.460 --> 42:14.974
That little guy to your left, that's
Arthur, king of the 1st kingdom.

42:15.140 --> 42:15.731
I know.

42:15.900 --> 42:17.891
You know he got decorated
this morning?

42:18.060 --> 42:19.652
How 'bout you tell me
something I don't know?

42:19.820 --> 42:23.130
You name it.
Who? What? Where? When? Why?

42:23.300 --> 42:26.417
- I got it all. Who's dating who even.
- Tell me about the 1st kingdom.

42:27.620 --> 42:30.180
- What's going down? You heard anything?
- Nothing to report.

42:30.340 --> 42:33.332
I received a message from the Minimoys
saying they were in danger.

42:33.500 --> 42:34.376
Do you know anything about it?

42:38.580 --> 42:41.174
Now that you mention it,
I did hear something.

42:41.340 --> 42:44.935
I heard that a major personality with
links to the Palace was in trouble.

42:45.100 --> 42:48.376
Trouble? What kind of trouble?
At the Palace? The Princess?

42:52.140 --> 42:53.334
More like the young Prince.

42:53.500 --> 42:55.058
- Betameche?
- Affirmative.

42:55.220 --> 42:56.938
Betameche is in trouble?
What happened?

42:57.620 --> 43:01.090
- I'm out of cash. I'll owe it to you.
- No, no.

43:01.260 --> 43:02.579
No cash, no juice.

43:02.740 --> 43:06.176
Give me the juice, or I'll put
the word out you wear a wig!

43:06.340 --> 43:07.614
Max! Please! Don't do that!

43:07.780 --> 43:10.817
People'll be so busy laughing,
I won't get the juice no more.

43:10.980 --> 43:13.369
Okay. So tell me
everything you know.

43:13.540 --> 43:17.135
Betameche was arrested by
the unicorns for some reason.

43:17.620 --> 43:19.975
The way they're headed, looks like
they're taking him to Kröb's palace.

43:20.140 --> 43:21.255
The way they're headed?

43:25.300 --> 43:28.212
You crook! You made me pay for
somethin' you seen behind me!

43:28.740 --> 43:30.537
I'll take care of him.

43:30.700 --> 43:32.338
Max, let's take care
of Betameche first!

43:32.500 --> 43:34.809
Create a diversion
and I'll try to free him.

43:35.460 --> 43:36.688
Wait, wait.

43:38.180 --> 43:39.659
Create a diversion?

43:40.900 --> 43:44.370
Bracelets, bracelets!
Pretty wormy bracelets, ladies!

43:44.860 --> 43:46.578
- Hey! Snow!
- What?

43:46.740 --> 43:49.174
- Whaddup! My man!
- Hey, Max!

43:59.020 --> 43:59.691
How's tricks?

44:00.060 --> 44:02.051
Hey, cuz! Long time no see!

44:02.220 --> 44:03.209
I know, right?

44:04.450 --> 44:05.210
funnykiddy rip for Subscene.com

44:11.700 --> 44:12.735
You look good.

44:13.740 --> 44:14.536
Thank you.

44:14.700 --> 44:16.611
- You take 'em?
- No, thank you.

44:17.580 --> 44:18.695
Glasses!

44:18.900 --> 44:20.618
Everybody needs glasses!

44:28.660 --> 44:32.209
- And your sister? Where's she at now?
- She's pregnant way up to here!

44:32.380 --> 44:34.974
- Again?
- Sure, it'll be her 20th!

44:35.140 --> 44:38.337
No kidding! You know, I don't think
I ever saw your sister...

44:38.500 --> 44:39.899
un-pregnant!

44:42.540 --> 44:45.213
Hey, you two! Break it up!
Get out of the street!

44:45.940 --> 44:48.135
- And your Mom?
- She doing good, she's at home.

44:57.900 --> 44:59.458
- Beta!
- Arthur?

45:01.900 --> 45:02.935
Hey, you.

45:06.380 --> 45:08.416
Hayfever. Makes me sneeze.

45:11.860 --> 45:12.895
Arthur, hurry.

45:13.060 --> 45:14.049
It's locked.

45:14.420 --> 45:15.409
Use my knife.

45:16.340 --> 45:17.455
Careful, careful.

45:21.260 --> 45:23.216
Okay, now hit the second button
to the left of the big one.

45:24.860 --> 45:26.930
Very pretty, but
this isn't the time or the place.

45:27.100 --> 45:28.294
Sorry.

45:30.700 --> 45:32.656
Perfect! Now put them
to work on the creeper.

45:35.780 --> 45:37.498
Hey, how about you?
How's your brother doing?

45:37.660 --> 45:40.538
Oh, he cool, he out there
doing that blueberry thing.

45:40.700 --> 45:42.372
Man, he makin'
a whole lotta money, too.

45:42.780 --> 45:44.532
It's beautiful, man.

45:44.780 --> 45:47.692
Break it up! Get out of the street,
go take your hellos somewhere else!

45:49.100 --> 45:50.249
You're new round here, ain't ya?

45:50.420 --> 45:51.409
Yeah. That's right.

45:51.580 --> 45:54.811
You know, when you tip into
someplace new, you gotta invest.

45:54.980 --> 45:57.210
Gotta take time and know wassup.
Also, you dig?

45:57.380 --> 46:00.133
Hey, I'm in Kröb's army. I don't have
to know what's up! You dig?

46:00.300 --> 46:02.052
I know that,

46:02.500 --> 46:05.492
but out here you're far away
from your little hole.

46:09.740 --> 46:12.493
This is our hood.

46:12.660 --> 46:16.289
So, if you're attached to that horn
of yours, you better stay polite.

46:16.460 --> 46:17.813
Y'know what I'm saying, brother?

46:26.660 --> 46:28.730
Yeah, I think I do.

46:29.020 --> 46:29.770
Nice!

46:30.340 --> 46:32.535
Now, Snow here is gonna teach you
how to say hello,

46:32.700 --> 46:35.168
'cos it looks like your Mama
never taught you that!

46:35.340 --> 46:38.377
Okay, cool. So, first you put
one hand out like this.

46:38.540 --> 46:40.496
That shows we think
we're of equal strength.

46:40.980 --> 46:44.734
Then, one flat across like this,
which means strength ain't an issue.

46:46.340 --> 46:48.217
What about something sharp?

46:48.380 --> 46:50.371
Okay, try the button
just beneath it.

46:53.060 --> 46:54.209
What are you doing with that?

46:54.500 --> 46:56.218
Nothing!
I found it on the ground.

46:56.580 --> 46:58.138
- Give it to me!
- Okay.

47:02.540 --> 47:03.939
Hey, what's this?

47:05.700 --> 47:06.894
- Get lost.
- Okay.

47:09.300 --> 47:11.052
What happened to your?

47:12.060 --> 47:14.130
Find me that prisoner!

47:16.700 --> 47:17.416
Come here.

47:23.340 --> 47:24.056
Let's go!

47:30.340 --> 47:31.739
Let's pretend we're tourists.

47:31.900 --> 47:33.777
Yeah, right.
I feel more like a local.

47:36.380 --> 47:37.130
There!

47:37.300 --> 47:38.972
- No, this way!
- Okay.

47:42.340 --> 47:43.409
You know how to drive this thing?

47:43.580 --> 47:45.411
It can't be more difficult
than flying a mosquito!

47:45.580 --> 47:46.410
Great

47:58.460 --> 48:00.655
- Let's try the other way.
- Yeah.

48:05.380 --> 48:06.051
Sorry!

48:15.700 --> 48:17.213
Hurry. Arthur, hurry!

48:24.500 --> 48:25.819
Good luck.

48:34.180 --> 48:35.249
You know where you're going?

48:35.420 --> 48:38.651
This is the basement of the house.
I saw the plans on Grandpa's desk.

48:42.820 --> 48:44.048
So that's nice to know.

48:44.460 --> 48:45.529
Now what are we going to do?

48:46.060 --> 48:47.732
Give me a second to think!

48:51.460 --> 48:54.418
- Time's up!
- Let's lose them one by one.

48:59.900 --> 49:01.697
- What was that?
- A rat trap.

49:01.860 --> 49:03.498
- What's a rat look like?
- Like that!

49:05.340 --> 49:06.534
Faster!

49:21.060 --> 49:22.857
- Are are you sure about this?
- No.

49:23.020 --> 49:23.691
Okay.

49:25.140 --> 49:26.209
Close your eyes.

49:26.380 --> 49:28.416
One, two, three.

49:55.260 --> 49:56.409
Home at last!

49:57.540 --> 49:58.336
Not just yet.

50:02.700 --> 50:05.658
Beta, any idea
to get rid of these parasites?

50:07.300 --> 50:08.016
Turn!

50:14.420 --> 50:15.057
What was that?

50:15.220 --> 50:18.098
The rat trap principle,
but with a frog!

50:22.820 --> 50:24.617
We're not losing them!
Can't you go any faster?

50:24.780 --> 50:26.418
Speed isn't the problem.
It's the lights.

50:26.580 --> 50:28.935
We need to lose the glow worms
before we can lose the Unicorns!

50:29.100 --> 50:31.694
Leave it to me!

50:34.020 --> 50:35.578
Sorry, sorry.

50:45.100 --> 50:47.568
- Arthur!
- I'm not watching!

50:48.100 --> 50:49.328
Oh, great!

50:54.820 --> 50:56.219
- Your turn.
- Okay.

50:58.220 --> 50:59.016
Careful.

51:00.540 --> 51:01.529
Hold on!

51:05.340 --> 51:07.808
No, no. Not me, please!

51:07.980 --> 51:09.015
Sorry.

51:12.980 --> 51:14.698
Great, Arthur, we did it!

51:14.860 --> 51:17.090
Only trouble is
flying without headlights!

51:22.860 --> 51:24.179
Arthur!

51:28.860 --> 51:30.930
I had this terrible nightmare!

51:31.100 --> 51:35.173
I dreamt that Arthur was being
chased by these giant insects.

51:36.580 --> 51:37.774
Archie?

51:45.220 --> 51:47.495
Oh, sweetheart! What a surprise!
You're not asleep?

51:47.660 --> 51:48.649
What's going on?

51:49.940 --> 51:51.089
Where's Arthur?

51:54.580 --> 51:56.377
He's... in the garden.

51:57.380 --> 51:59.291
You let him go back?

51:59.860 --> 52:01.418
Oh my God!

52:01.940 --> 52:03.532
This really is a nightmare!

52:03.700 --> 52:05.019
Daisy!

52:05.180 --> 52:08.570
The Minimoys are in real danger and
Arthur is the only one that can help.

52:08.940 --> 52:10.771
I offered to go instead,
but he refused.

52:10.940 --> 52:13.090
He wanted me to stay
and look after you.

52:13.260 --> 52:15.137
He's an angel.

52:15.300 --> 52:17.609
What about his parents?
Where are they?

52:20.220 --> 52:22.290
Rose! Armand! What happened?

52:22.460 --> 52:25.293
- Armand wanted to take a shortcut.
- We had an accident.

52:25.460 --> 52:27.576
- We hit a goat.
- We hit a ram.

52:27.740 --> 52:29.856
- No, it was a little goat.
- It was an animal.

52:30.020 --> 52:31.339
Was the animal hurt?

52:31.700 --> 52:33.850
The animal was fine!
My car is ruined!

52:34.020 --> 52:36.693
Armand, it's just a car.
At least no one was hurt.

52:36.860 --> 52:39.010
Yes, you're right.

52:39.820 --> 52:41.412
There is something
that bothers me, though...

52:43.220 --> 52:45.575
- What?
- None of you asked where Arthur is.

52:48.900 --> 52:52.017
At first, we thought
he'd turned into a wolf,

52:52.180 --> 52:54.091
but actually, he's disappeared!

52:55.020 --> 52:56.772
I'll let you take that one.

52:57.380 --> 52:58.972
Rose, let's get you cleaned up.

52:59.620 --> 53:01.690
- Can you fix this?
- Sure I can.

53:05.540 --> 53:06.768
Armand, let's have a little talk.

53:08.020 --> 53:09.055
Oh, I'm sorry.

53:15.340 --> 53:18.252
Listen, I don't know
where Arthur is exactly.

53:18.420 --> 53:21.457
But he knows every inch of that land
and he wouldn't have gotten lost.

53:21.700 --> 53:23.372
I know I can be hard on him.

53:24.620 --> 53:26.019
I'm just trying to protect him.

53:26.180 --> 53:29.058
He's better prepared for survival
than most young kids.

53:30.980 --> 53:32.618
Well, I know he's clever and...

53:33.940 --> 53:35.419
I trust him,

53:36.180 --> 53:37.215
but...

53:37.660 --> 53:38.297
But?

53:40.140 --> 53:41.209
He's still so...

53:41.380 --> 53:42.529
little!

53:45.980 --> 53:47.379
Well, don't worry.

53:47.540 --> 53:48.734
Tomorrow...

53:49.500 --> 53:50.569
he will be bigger!

53:54.860 --> 53:56.532
Let's go find your car.

54:29.220 --> 54:30.858
- Beta?
- Huh? What?

54:31.220 --> 54:33.051
Do you have any idea where we are?

54:34.980 --> 54:36.015
A cocoon.

54:36.780 --> 54:39.658
Right. And how do we get out
of a cocoon?

54:39.820 --> 54:42.892
Don't worry, as soon it feels
the sun, it'll wake up.

54:43.900 --> 54:46.619
- And then?
- Then, it'll open up and we'll...

54:49.580 --> 54:50.854
Fall out!!

54:56.620 --> 54:58.258
I hate being thrown
out of bed like that,

54:58.420 --> 55:00.775
and you have to start the day
without even a proper breakfast.

55:00.940 --> 55:02.055
The house!

55:02.540 --> 55:04.496
Yeah, but let's try
getting back to mine, ok?

55:08.420 --> 55:09.614
This is wonderful!

55:09.780 --> 55:12.055
And absolutely impossible
to steer!

55:12.220 --> 55:15.895
It goes wherever it feels like,
which is not my village!

55:16.220 --> 55:17.858
How do we get off a butterfly?

55:18.500 --> 55:21.492
We have two alternatives.
One, you wait for it to land.

55:21.660 --> 55:23.412
And two, we...

55:25.500 --> 55:26.216
jump!

55:44.180 --> 55:45.932
It's so sticky!

55:46.100 --> 55:48.853
Take it easy! Don't move around
or you're gonna get even more stuck.

55:51.380 --> 55:52.176
Beta! Look.

55:52.340 --> 55:55.332
Are you deaf or something?
I said take a chill pill! Calm down!

55:55.500 --> 55:56.489
Beta! Behind you!

56:07.660 --> 56:08.456
No sweat!

56:08.620 --> 56:10.451
- That was amazing!
- It's nothing really.

56:10.620 --> 56:12.497
When I was little,
I worked on a spider farm.

56:12.660 --> 56:16.892
They act so big and tough,
but they're softer than dewdrops!

56:17.380 --> 56:18.415
Come on.

56:27.740 --> 56:28.536
Hop on!

56:29.940 --> 56:31.293
Don't tell me
you're scared of spiders!

56:31.460 --> 56:34.213
Usually, no!
But I've never seen one so big!

57:06.660 --> 57:08.173
Oh, don't worry.
It's only my wife.

57:08.340 --> 57:10.979
She must have seen a spider.
Like every other morning.

57:12.500 --> 57:15.139
In the bed!
It was huge and it was hairy!

57:15.300 --> 57:17.814
And it was staring at me
with big fat red eyes!

57:17.980 --> 57:20.733
Calm down, honey!
You're the one with the red eyes.

57:20.900 --> 57:22.174
Didn't you sleep well last night?

57:22.340 --> 57:23.853
How am I supposed to get any sleep

57:24.020 --> 57:26.409
with all of these
creepy-crawlies around?

57:26.580 --> 57:28.650
- I'll just have a look.
- Careful...

57:56.100 --> 57:57.374
<i>- Hi.
- I called because...</i>

57:57.540 --> 58:00.054
<i>You have called
the Police Department.</i>

58:00.220 --> 58:01.858
<i>Please hold the /ine.</i>

58:03.740 --> 58:07.255
I was riding along on my gamullus
when this Unicorn patrol

58:07.420 --> 58:10.617
cut right in front of me from the
left side. I had the right of way.

58:10.780 --> 58:12.816
That was when the village got
worried about your disappearance

58:12.980 --> 58:15.016
and sent me a message
asking for help?

58:15.180 --> 58:17.171
No! I left the village
just that morning.

58:17.340 --> 58:19.729
No one would have been worried
about me til the nightime, at least.

58:19.900 --> 58:22.175
In fact, they were all so excited
about the banquet in your honor,

58:22.340 --> 58:24.251
I don't think anyone even noticed
I was gone.

58:24.420 --> 58:28.572
That's the message I got. So, if
you weren't in danger, who is?

58:28.740 --> 58:31.254
I don't know.
I think we're gonna find out.

58:34.060 --> 58:35.778
Yes? What do you want?

58:35.940 --> 58:39.455
I want to get home. Betameche?
The Prince? The Palace? Ring any bells?

58:39.620 --> 58:42.896
Beta! What are you doing outside?
I didn't even see you leave!

58:43.740 --> 58:46.857
See that? Nobody cares
about me in this kingdom!

58:49.700 --> 58:52.294
Here. Thanks for the ride.
Now, go on, beat it!

58:56.660 --> 58:57.376
Come mon.

58:58.740 --> 58:59.855
Finally.

59:01.420 --> 59:02.535
Home!

59:04.060 --> 59:06.290
Lucky for you, Betameche,
you weren't here!

59:06.460 --> 59:08.974
- You missed a real drama!
- What kind of a drama?

59:09.140 --> 59:12.894
The banquet was canceled!
Arthur never showed up. Just think!

59:13.060 --> 59:15.779
Your father was in such a state!
Forget about Selenia!

59:15.940 --> 59:18.170
She really believed in him.

59:18.340 --> 59:21.889
I know he's changed a lot since
the last time I saw him, but...

59:23.900 --> 59:25.652
- Arthur?
- It looks like him!

59:25.820 --> 59:28.414
Holy bumblebee!
It's a miracle!

59:33.860 --> 59:37.535
What? Arthur's here?
Oh my Goodness! Quick!

59:37.700 --> 59:39.770
Come on, Mogoth! Up we go!

59:39.940 --> 59:42.329
Will you come on!
Now let's go, let's go.

59:42.980 --> 59:45.335
My ceremonial robes!

59:45.620 --> 59:47.417
Our guest has arrived!

59:50.500 --> 59:51.216
Off we go!

59:52.540 --> 59:55.850
What kinda time to arrive is this?
My buffet looks terrible now!

59:56.020 --> 59:58.978
The flowers have all wilted and
the dewdrops have almost evaporated!

59:59.140 --> 01:00:00.812
Prosciutto, stop complaining!

01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:04.017
All that matters is that Arthur
is here, safe and sound!

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.216
Never mind the banquet,
whip us up a quick little snack!

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:10.817
I don't do fast-food, sire!
I make the culinary masterpieces!

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:14.769
Fine! Whip us up a culinary
masterpiece! You have 5 minutes!

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:21.378
Picolo? Go see if the stores
have anything edible.

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:24.459
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:28.614
- Pleased to see you, little fella!
- I'm pleased to see all of you, too!

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:31.497
- Yeah, we were worried!
- I'm sorry.

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:34.094
We prayed to the Goddess
of the Forest for you.

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:36.057
Okay, that's enough.
Come mon, let's go!

01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:38.049
Hi.

01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:48.339
My boy!
What joy to see you again!

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.218
Arthur! Here you are at last!

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:53.258
- Let me shake your hand!
- Miro, leave him alone!

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:56.660
My young friend!
What in heavens name happened to you?

01:00:56.980 --> 01:01:00.256
Late yesterday, I received an SOS
message carved on a grain of rice,

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:02.012
so I thought you must be in danger.

01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:04.091
A message? On a grain of rice?

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:06.137
Now, that is a funny idea!

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:13.575
My young friend! If you had read
the great book more attentively,

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:16.413
you would know that Minimoys
only communicate by leaf!

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:17.251
I know, sir, but...

01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:20.617
And there's a leaf for every occasion.
Oak leaves for the great laws.

01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:22.418
Birch leaves for labor regulations.

01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:24.377
Cabbage leaves
for birth announcements.

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:27.134
And wild oat leaves
for intimate correspondence.

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:30.292
- My father has a box full of...
- Enough, Betameche! Quiet!

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.968
Had we wanted to send you
a message of distress,

01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:35.893
we wouldn't have carved it on a
grain of rice but on a pine needle.

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:37.573
Why, yes! So much easier to carry!

01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:39.494
But continue with your story.

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:43.494
I was about to use the telescope
when a cloud passed across the Moon.

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.856
So, I had to use
the creeper technique!

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:48.896
And I fell in on Max's bar.

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:51.779
Then I met Betameche, who
had been captured by the Unicorns.

01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:53.851
My son?
What did you do this time?

01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:56.170
Refuse to yield the right of way.

01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:58.774
I put that bracelet on your wrist so
you'd know your right from your left.

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:01.500
I know! I just keep forgetting
which wrist you put it on.

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.132
Never mind. What then?

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.570
After that we caught a spider
all the way here.

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:09.049
Marvelous!
All's well that ends well!

01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:11.529
Let the festivities begin!

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:18.536
Pressure!

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:28.049
Prosciutto? Allow me to introduce
you to the one-and-only Arthur...

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:30.609
<i>Benvenuto.</i>

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:31.974
It's wonderful!

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:36.208
I just knocked it off! It looks pretty
good but actually it tastes like...

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:37.256
Nothing!

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:39.217
Young Prince! The honor is yours!

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:42.178
What would you like?

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.215
It's very kind of you,

01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:47.816
but, Sire, what I'd really like is

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:50.858
to be able to share this occasion
with the Princess.

01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:53.818
Of course! Silly me!

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:57.099
Selenia? Daughter?

01:02:57.260 --> 01:02:58.329
Where's she gone to now?

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:02.015
She was so disappointed
that she locked herself in her room.

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:04.696
Miro? Show him the way!

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:05.849
Thank you, Sire

01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:12.177
Selenia doesn't live in the Palace?

01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:16.728
Ever since she met you,
emancipation has been the keyword!

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:19.653
The young lady insists
on her independence!

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:22.334
That's the way it is
with girls these days!

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:30.169
I have a surprise for you!

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:35.772
Where has she gone to now?

01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:37.578
Maybe she sent me the message?

01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:40.330
Maybe she's in danger somewhere?

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:43.014
No! I saw her only a few hours ago.

01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:51.737
Or maybe she simply forgot
that I was coming to see her.

01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:55.651
Selenia? Forget you?
Now, that is funny!

01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:58.539
Let me tell you how she spent
the day preparing for your arrival

01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:00.975
after waiting
for so many moons.

01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:04.257
Yesterday morning, the Sun
had barely caressed her face,

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:06.092
she was already up!

01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:28.174
As she does every morning,
she washed,

01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:30.809
then gobbled down her breakfast

01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:34.450
of raspberry purée
and fresh hazelnut.

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:45.168
After that, she hurried
to her singing lesson.

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:47.854
- She wants to become a singer?
- No, not at all!

01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:51.695
Selenia likes pretty words but won't
allow them to escare her royal lips

01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:54.169
without total control.
If you want my opinion,

01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:56.092
she has something important
to tell you

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:58.296
and she doesn't want her voice
to let her down.

01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:02.933
I missed you so much!

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:23.975
The nightingale is acclaimed as the
best singing teacher in the kingdom,

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:25.175
but he's a mean old bird

01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:28.173
and Selenia had real trouble
persuading him to give her a lesson.

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:32.332
In return, she had to give him
the address of a publicity-shy

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:34.570
craftsman who breeds worms in apples.

01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:37.857
When she got back from her lesson,
her throat was so sore,

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:41.057
I had to make her a violet infusion
to soothe her vocal chords.

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:45.932
The pain soon went
and she ended up falling asleep.

01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:49.251
- And she slept through till evening?
- No, my boy! Far from it!

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:52.537
She spent much of the day in the gym
with Gambetto, her trainer.

01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:55.137
Maestro Gambetto

01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:56.938
who is a scarabterus-philanthropis,

01:05:57.100 --> 01:06:00.410
a distant cousin of the praying
mantis, even though he swears

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:03.299
he's no relation
to that particular maneater.

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:18.850
Selenia hardly ever
takes class with him

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:21.773
because his astonishing flexibility
doesn't extend to his personality

01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:25.535
and his exercises are
exceedingly difficult to follow.

01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:38.494
But the Princess was determined
to assert her control

01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:40.571
over every single one of her muscles.

01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:51.091
- Then, she slept til evening?
- Yes,

01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:54.570
but when it was time to go to the
Transit Hall to greet your arrival,

01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:56.890
believe me, she was ready!

01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:01.695
How do I look?

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:03.650
Sublime!

01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:04.810
I know.

01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:08.969
She looked magnificent!

01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:11.176
She had chosen
the beautiful little dress

01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:13.900
made of rose petals that she picked
herself and stitched together.

01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:16.574
And she was wearing
a delicious vanilla scent!

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:22.570
She reached the Transit Hall
over an hour early.

01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:26.417
Which the Ferryman didn't fail
to bring to her attention.

01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:30.812
Selenia! What are you doing?
It's way too early!

01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:41.888
Then she settled down comfortably
to wait for her Prince Charming.

01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:57.571
What time is it, my good Miro?

01:07:58.060 --> 01:07:59.732
Well past midnight, sire.

01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:04.572
I think we can safely conclude that
Arthur won't be coming this time.

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:13.173
Unfortunately,
her Prince never came.

01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:16.459
Selenia was so sad

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:19.054
that I couldn't find
a single word to console her.

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:22.857
She stayed there without moving
for many hours until,

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:25.693
suddenly, she jumped up
and left the village,

01:08:25.859 --> 01:08:28.169
headed for the great plains.

01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:29.734
What for?

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:33.853
Probably to whisper her woes
to the breeze

01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:37.410
so that it would carry them
far away.

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:47.613
That's the whole story.
Or as much of it as I know.

01:08:47.979 --> 01:08:50.288
So if it wasn't Selenia in danger,

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:52.131
or Betameche or the village,

01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:53.573
who sent me the message?

01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:56.254
I'm sure Selenia can help you
figure that out.

01:08:56.939 --> 01:08:58.930
Yes, if she ever comes back!

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:01.096
Selenia at the gate!

01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:04.138
- Selenia?
- Lf you want, you can go on ahead.

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.095
Open the gate.

01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:27.368
Malthazar!

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:33.809
Oh my goodness!

01:09:34.939 --> 01:09:37.328
What a pleasure to see you again,
young Arthur.

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:38.615
The pleasure isn't mutual.

01:09:38.779 --> 01:09:42.568
I know, but don't hold it against me.
The necklace you wear around your neck

01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:46.095
is a reminder that we are all
part of nature's great circle,

01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:47.136
my dear cousin.

01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:49.450
Perhaps, between cousins,
we can reach an agreement.

01:09:49.979 --> 01:09:51.095
I'll give you my life

01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:53.136
in exchange for Selenia's.

01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:55.650
- No!
- Silence!

01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:00.688
Sorry, Arthur. Not so long ago,

01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:04.694
your little swap might have tempted
me, but I have better plans now.

01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:08.057
I'm tired of your little world.
I want size.

01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:10.814
I want scope. I want big!

01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:12.811
You sent the SOS message!

01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:16.336
You knew I'd come and that I'd have
to open the passage to do so.

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:18.695
Which would leave
the path open for you

01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:21.374
to take the return trip
and grow to your full size.

01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:23.849
Bravo! How perceptive of you!

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:26.534
If I had a hand free,
I'd give you a round of applause.

01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:29.612
I have never heard
such a dastardly plot!

01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:31.373
Thank you! It wasn't easy

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:35.658
and it took all of my genius
to bring my plan to fruition.

01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:40.495
After the bitter defeat
Arthur inflicted upon me,

01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:42.935
I wandered the lower levels
for some time

01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:45.409
with one single idea in my mind.

01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:48.299
I would find him and make him
pay for his insolence.

01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:51.258
The Bubble Smuggler had mentioned
a good vantage point

01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:54.730
from which to observe the comings
and goings of everybody in the house.

01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:10.894
Smuggler was right.
It didn't take long for me

01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:12.891
to get to know the wonderful Daisy.

01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:18.020
She initiated me into
all the wonders of your world.

01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:21.490
That fabulous box
that manufactures cold

01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:23.696
and the smaller one
that generates heat.

01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:26.738
And all that food that she brought in
from who knows where.

01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:29.130
But the most amazing thing
about her

01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:31.291
was her constant good humor.

01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:36.058
She seemed to do everything with love,
which is a foreign concept to me.

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:40.212
Even when she had all of her tools
of torture lined up on the counter,

01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:42.735
it was just to transform
vulgar vegetables

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:45.209
into works of art.

01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:48.180
It was a fascinating spectacle
and I could sit

01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:50.410
for hours just watching her.

01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:54.697
And then I encountered your mother.

01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:59.650
I have never met a specimen
so unadapted to her environment!

01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:04.209
Mom?

01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:07.099
Fortunately, your Grandfather,
the gallant Archibald,

01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:10.297
was always around to keep things
ticking over.

01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:13.737
I was able to watch him repair
the machine that made fire,

01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:15.978
the one that made sun

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:18.499
and the one that made water.

01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:23.580
My desire for conquest was reignited.

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:26.732
The warrior that I am
had regained his appetite.

01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:29.972
Nothing and no one could stop me now!

01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:33.133
Not even your father
and his ridiculous offensives.

01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:45.809
I am so rotten inside
that only effect

01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:49.177
his spray had was to rid me
of a few parasites.

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:51.776
But your father did reveal to me

01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:54.135
my only weakness in this world...

01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:56.732
My size!

01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:01.379
And this is where you come in!
All I had to do

01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:04.373
was be patient and wait for the day
you'd visit the Minimoys,

01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:07.771
so I could take the lightbeam back,
as you so shrewedly pointed out.

01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:12.655
Finding out the date was not difficult
because the kitchen was not only

01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:15.573
the nerve center which everybody
visited at some point, but it was also

01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:19.813
the perfect spot to listen in
on conversations upstairs.

01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:24.938
These are the eternal codes
of the nature.

01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:28.498
I was accepted into the great circle
and tonight there's a big party!

01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:30.969
- That's nice, dear!
- Yeah! It's the tenth moon.

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:33.335
The Minimoys are preparing
a feast in my honor.

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.650
Everything was going smoothly.

01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:38.131
All I had to do was to wait
for your departure.

01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:40.370
And then, suddenly,
it was all catastrophe.

01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:44.129
Honey, pack your bags.
We're leaving tonight!

01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:48.978
This last minute twist
threatened to ruin my plot!

01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:51.654
The idea of vegetating
for another ten moons

01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:53.538
in this cabinet was unbearable.

01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:57.010
I had to find a ploy to make Arthur
disobey his father.

01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:00.172
And what better than love

01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:02.410
to make a young man
do something silly?

01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:06.289
How could Arthur possibly resist
a call to save his Princess

01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:07.779
from mortal danger?

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:11.575
So I found something to write on

01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:14.174
and carved the message into it myself.

01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:16.889
This is absurd!

01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:19.528
Everybody knows that the Minimoys
write their messages on leaves!

01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:22.658
And only a pine needle would have been
appropriate in this case.

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:26.449
My apologies, but there weren't
any pine needles in my cabinet.

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:36.977
All that was left was
to win over a messenger

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:39.096
and point him to your room
for personal delivery.

01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:48.257
Then, I returned to the seven kingdoms
through secret passages

01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:51.059
that I alone am aware of,

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:55.611
and I had the good fortune
to encounter the charming Princess

01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:59.729
wandering the plains like a lost soul.

01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:05.095
Now you know the full story,

01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:07.137
let me tell you what happens next.

01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:09.859
What time is it, my good Miro?

01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:11.859
Five to noon.

01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:15.729
High time for us to head to the
Transit Hall to say farewell!

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:45.975
Wait!

01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:54.170
What is it now?

01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:56.410
I wish to make the trip
through the telescope.

01:15:56.580 --> 01:15:59.048
Another one? You people
just can't stay in one place!

01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:01.654
After me, you can rest in peace.

01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:04.892
Say, aren't you little Maltazard?

01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:08.659
It's been many moons since
I last saw you! You've grown!

01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:10.776
Yes, and I'm going to grow some more!

01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:13.490
What's the big deal
about growing!

01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:15.252
You'd be better off
getting some sleep!

01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:17.490
Have you seen yourself
in a mirror lately?

01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:21.250
Hold your tongue, you old fool!
Or your sleep will be eternal!

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:22.933
Yes, sir!

01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:25.976
A quarter turn to the right
for the body...

01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:29.732
Distract him, I have an idea.

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:33.458
Give me something
I can throw at him.

01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:34.575
Okay.

01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:37.929
Too small.

01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:42.689
Too big.

01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:46.413
Three quarter turns to the left
for the mind...

01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:49.649
Too cute!

01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:51.972
- Beta, hurry!
- I'm coming!

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:54.938
Excuse me, Sir? You know you're
heading for the humans world

01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:57.534
but having Selenia under your feet
will only slow you down.

01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:01.090
Don't worry, I have no intention
of taking the little pest with me.

01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:05.219
I'll find plenty more up there
who'll be delighted to serve me.

01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:10.179
And one whole turn for the soul!

01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:21.128
Amazing!

01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:25.732
I didn't touch anything. I was just
looking. Is that your telescope?

01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:27.094
- Yes.
- Really?

01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:31.173
Cause in your telescope
there's little... with big...

01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:32.898
Those are the Minimoys.

01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:36.609
- The Mini what?
- The Minimoys. They're our brothers.

01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:42.372
Oh, your brothers. Really?
How tall was your mother?

01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:45.532
- Our mother is nature.
- Your mother is nature. Right.

01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:48.533
Well, that would explain
why you're... and they're...

01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:51.054
That must be the mechanic.

01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:52.899
I'll be right back.

01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:55.809
In position!

01:17:56.540 --> 01:17:59.100
If his Highness
would care to lift off...

01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:01.012
With pleasure!

01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:06.332
- Beta! Quick!
- I'm coming!

01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:15.854
Be still, be still!

01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:17.419
- Now!
- Here.

01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:44.609
Did you hear that noise?

01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:46.771
- That's your transmission.
- No, it came from the forest.

01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:54.890
So I figure
this'll take me about a week.

01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:58.132
I have to get my boy back to school,
and I have to find a job.

01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:00.131
Well, I could put a rush on it
for ya, but it'll cost ya.

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:02.575
I need it tomorrow.
I'll pay you whatever you want.

01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:03.855
- Whatever I want?
- Whatever you want.

01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:05.248
You got a deal.

01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:18.818
My Prince!
You saved my life again!

01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:21.533
That's what Princes are for.

01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:42.135
- What happened? Where's Arthur?
- I don't know.

01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:45.019
Something shot out of the telescope,
like a cannonball,

01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:48.331
but I don't think it was Arthur.
It landed somewhere in the forest.

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:50.889
If it wasn't Arthur, what is it?

01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:54.169
M...

01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:56.335
the evil M.

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:01.934
The only rock around for miles
and I hit it?

01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:22.418
You're not going to eat me, are you?

01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:24.377
Yes.

01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:53.815
The first law of nature.
Eat or be eaten.

01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:59.249
The Evil M. Knew that if he sent
an SOS message to Arthur,

01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:02.139
the boy would do everything
to come to the aid of his friends

01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:06.657
and once the passage was open,
it was easy to come the other way.

01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:10.296
- Now, he's out there somewhere.
- What about Arthur? Where is he?

01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:12.257
He'll probably show up soon.

01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:24.619
Oh my God!

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:26.613
The passage is broken.

01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:34.813
Marshmallows!

01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:37.979
Arthur, come on,
I know you're hiding here somewhere.

01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:44.176
Come on, don't hide!

01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:46.058
Daddy's worried.

01:21:46.660 --> 01:21:48.969
Arthur, I'm not angry with you!
I promise.

01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:51.658
You won't be punished.

01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:56.499
Thank god I found you.

01:21:56.660 --> 01:22:00.255
If you come out now, you'll get a big
bag of marshmallows all to yourself.

01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:01.409
What do you say?

01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:05.459
A plump pack of sweet, juicy
marshmallows that melt in your mouth.

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:07.531
I know where you are,
come on out, now!

01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:09.656
Who are these delicious
marshmallows for?

01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:11.969
For me.

01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:17.850
I'll go get a full bag.

01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:14.736
How will Arthur escape
Maltazard's diabolical trap?

01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:17.698
