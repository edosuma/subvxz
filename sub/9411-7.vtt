00:38.900 --> 00:40.900
Oh, I can't go any further.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.400
My lungs are gonna burst.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.900
We have to hide the gold!

00:45.900 --> 00:49.467
- We'll hang for sure if
they find it on us.   - Oh!

00:49.467 --> 00:52.467
- [ Barking Continues ]
- We worked hard to steal this.

00:52.467 --> 00:54.833
We'll come back for it later,
you bumbling lout!

00:54.833 --> 00:57.867
- Quickly! Let's hide it in there.
- No! Not in there.

00:57.867 --> 01:01.500
- That's the Changing Tree.
- Aw! That's superstitious nonsense!

01:02.367 --> 01:05.167
- Let go! Give it to me!
- I'm afraid.

01:33.867 --> 01:36.100
It's just the wind, Cooper.

01:38.100 --> 01:40.167
Wind doesn't go scrunching
through the leaves.

01:40.167 --> 01:44.367

What's the matter, Cooper?
Afraid of little doggies?

02:54.433 --> 02:56.867
- What were you doing under there anyway?
- I was waiting.

started talking about the dogs--

03:03.333 --> 03:05.833
- Get off me!
- it was too perfect!

03:05.833 --> 03:07.333
- Get off.
- Give me this!

- No, give me it!
- Give it to me.

- What is going on?
- He started it!

03:11.100 --> 03:12.933

lose somethin', like your mind?

At least I've got one to lose.

Oh. Good one.

Okay, but why'd you say that--
that we have to get out of here?

that lived in your house,

06:48.567 --> 06:50.967
well, one day
they were just gone.

were still there.

06:53.467 --> 06:55.667

06:55.667 --> 06:59.667
There was even a pot of chili
cooking on a stove.

But no sign of the people
or their dogs.

11:32.100 --> 11:35.267
I shouldn't have told him that story.
He was really scared.

For what?
Liking my brother?

11:53.333 --> 11:56.000
No.
For listening to him.

11:56.433 --> 11:58.433
He's a jerk.

11:58.433 --> 12:00.200
He said you played practical
jokes all the time.

- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
- You didn't.

- But you ran, and--
- It's nothing you said.

12:08.133 --> 12:11.067
- It's what I saw with my own eyes.
- What?

12:11.067 --> 12:15.700
After you disappeared, these huge,
black dogs came and chased me home.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.667
They appeared at my house
last night out of nowhere.

12:18.667 --> 12:20.767
They escaped by jumping
through the walls!

12:21.700 --> 12:24.700
Jumping through the walls?

12:24.700 --> 12:27.067
Yeah. Right.
Jumping through the walls.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.400
Like ghosts.

Did you tell anybody?

- But--
- Silence!

Silence in the Changing Tree.

Three centuries ago, my companion and
I were coming through these very woods,

15:51.867 --> 15:55.900
and then for no reason, two vicious
dogs flung themselves upon us...

15:55.900 --> 15:59.933
and pushed us into this cursed
place, where we were changed.

15:59.933 --> 16:04.600
Yeah, but we didn't do it.
What do you want us for?

16:04.600 --> 16:09.700
- Ah, the cruel hand of fate.
- Excuse me?

16:09.700 --> 16:13.100
We are going to change places,
and you will be like us--

16:13.100 --> 16:15.600
dogs condemned to roam
these woods forever!

16:17.067 --> 16:19.733
Fergie--
[ Screaming ]

16:19.733 --> 16:21.733
[ Cooper ]
Cut it out. Your nose is all wet.

16:21.733 --> 16:24.233
[ Fergie ] Yeah, well, your breath
isn't exactly minty fresh.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.733
- I feel kind of strange.
- Me too.

16:27.233 --> 16:29.733
- What's happening to us?
- We're dogs!

16:30.233 --> 16:31.867
How did you say that?
Your lips weren't moving.

16:32.367 --> 16:35.633
I don't have any lips. You mean,
we can read each other's thoughts?

16:35.633 --> 16:37.533
I think so.
What am I thinking now?

16:37.967 --> 16:41.467
Chicken. Chicken salad.
Chicken pot pie. Chicken wings.

16:41.467 --> 16:44.833
Fergie! What are we gonna do?
We're dogs!

16:44.833 --> 16:48.167
- I got a flea!    - Quit messin' around!
We've gotta do something.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.500
Those creeps are probably passing
themselves off as us right now!

16:51.933 --> 16:53.767
- Come on. Let's go.
- [ Barking ]

16:53.767 --> 16:56.167
[ Growling, Snarling ]

17:05.233 --> 17:08.733
Cooper! Fergie!
What have you been doing?

17:08.733 --> 17:12.767
You're filthy.
And use your forks.

17:12.767 --> 17:14.666
Huh?

17:16.967 --> 17:19.867
[ Snarling, Munching ]

17:29.467 --> 17:32.300
[ Gruff's Voice ] Touch that, and
you'll be drawing back a bloody stump!

17:34.033 --> 17:37.467
- Cooper, what is wrong with you?
- You told me to use my fork.

17:40.800 --> 17:43.500
[ Dad ] Any more of that,
young man, and you're grounded.

17:44.900 --> 17:46.900
[ Cooper ]
What are we gonna do?

17:46.900 --> 17:49.233
We're gonna be
stuck as dogs forever!

17:49.233 --> 17:50.567
Gotta come up with a plan.

17:50.567 --> 17:53.067
Think of something,
besides chicken salad.

17:53.067 --> 17:55.567
Sorry! I'm hungry.
I can't help it.

17:55.567 --> 17:57.567
It looks so juicy.

17:57.567 --> 17:59.300
And delicious.

17:59.300 --> 18:03.900
And it smells so good.
I can't take it anymore!

18:09.200 --> 18:12.300
Those dogs are wild!
Get them out of here!

18:12.300 --> 18:14.667
Shoo! Get out!
Get the broom.

18:14.667 --> 18:18.067
- Get out of here! Get-- Go on!
- Shoo!

18:18.067 --> 18:21.100
- Get out of here.
- I can't believe it, Cooper. You were right.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.400
- We gotta call the pound.
- [ Gruff Voice ] The pound?

18:23.400 --> 18:25.433
Yeah. They'll catch these mutts
and put them to sleep.

18:25.433 --> 18:27.933
- Sleep?
- Yeah, you know--

18:27.933 --> 18:30.033
Good plan!

18:31.267 --> 18:33.467
- [ Panting ]
- Get back!

18:35.433 --> 18:38.667
Go on! Get out of here!

18:38.667 --> 18:41.667
- Get them!
- [ Barking ]

18:45.667 --> 18:47.167
Oh.

18:48.667 --> 18:51.167
Come on, Fergie.
You know where we can hide.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.333
- Here they come. Down.
- [ Dog Cooper ] Where'd they go?

18:58.333 --> 19:02.333
- I'm not sure.
- We have to find those dogs!

19:02.833 --> 19:04.333
Take it easy.

19:10.633 --> 19:12.067
[ Growling ]

19:13.067 --> 19:14.900
- [ Chittering ]
- What was that?

19:15.900 --> 19:18.933
Nothing.
Just a chipmunk.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.500
Wait a minute.

19:23.433 --> 19:25.433
Come here.

19:25.900 --> 19:27.833
Aren't these dog prints?

19:28.400 --> 19:30.333
Let me see.

19:30.833 --> 19:32.833
- Be careful.
- Why?

19:33.833 --> 19:35.933
Look where we are.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.633
- [ Barking ]
- [ Screams ]

19:49.067 --> 19:51.567
- Here.
- [ Grunts ]

19:51.567 --> 19:54.567
- All right!
- It worked!

19:54.567 --> 19:57.567
Let's get out of here
and never come near here again.

19:57.567 --> 19:59.567
Right.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.433
Are you all right, Mickey?

20:06.833 --> 20:09.500
- What's with your brother?
- Who knows?

20:09.500 --> 20:11.967
He's always been a little weird,
if you ask me.

20:12.967 --> 20:14.967
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

20:18.433 --> 20:20.667
[ Chittering ]

20:20.667 --> 20:23.300
Hey, Cooper!
You weasel.

20:23.300 --> 20:26.067
Don't leave me here!
What am I gonna do?

20:26.500 --> 20:29.500
You gotta help me, Cooper!
This isn't funny anymore!
