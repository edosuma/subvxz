WEBVTT

00:52.510 --> 00:54.596
When is
your silent treatment going to end?

00:59.476 --> 01:00.560
Never mind.

01:01.394 --> 01:02.228
Keep going, then.

01:02.312 --> 01:03.897
Did we break up?

01:04.898 --> 01:07.275
What? No!

01:07.358 --> 01:08.902
Do you want to break up?

01:08.985 --> 01:10.528
You didn't contact me since then.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.655
-You didn't, either.
-I did.

01:12.739 --> 01:16.076
What are you on about?
You didn't talk to me sincerely.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.204
Hey, we're here.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.874
-Gosh, my shoulders.
-Fine.

01:25.126 --> 01:26.711
Why were you together?

01:27.629 --> 01:29.297
Oh, we just ran into each other.

01:29.964 --> 01:31.299
Only Ji-wan's left, then.

01:31.382 --> 01:33.843
Ji-wan's always late!

01:34.469 --> 01:36.721
She's arriving soon. Sorry.

01:37.430 --> 01:40.266
-Why is she apologizing?
-Yun Sol!

01:42.435 --> 01:44.145
She…

01:45.271 --> 01:48.525
I guess she can only see Yun Sol.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.151
Can't you see us?

01:50.860 --> 01:52.904
I'm so sorry, guys.

01:52.987 --> 01:55.615
I came out early, but I missed the bus.

01:55.698 --> 01:57.617
She always makes this excuse.

01:59.327 --> 02:01.412
But what about Jae-eon?

02:01.496 --> 02:04.499
-He's not coming.
-What? Why? Oh, no…

02:04.582 --> 02:06.918
Why not? Do you have a crush on him too?

02:07.001 --> 02:09.295
It's not that…

02:09.379 --> 02:10.672
I don't!

02:10.755 --> 02:13.049
It seems weirder if you react like that.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.760
Forget it. Let's go.
Everyone else already left.

02:15.844 --> 02:18.721
-Let's go.
-Na-bi will come, though.

02:26.104 --> 02:27.355
Who's driving?

02:28.314 --> 02:29.482
I'll do it.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.402
Hurry up, then.

02:33.403 --> 02:34.529
What?

02:36.072 --> 02:37.615
Why do I feel lonely?

02:38.616 --> 02:40.118
Wait for me!

03:18.281 --> 03:19.782
They look delicious.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.869
Can we have two of those, please?

03:22.952 --> 03:24.370
-Two?
-Yes.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.581
What about these?

03:26.664 --> 03:28.666
-Let's eat them later.
-Okay.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.376
Thank you.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.712
-Here. Thank you.
-This looks great.

03:32.795 --> 03:34.672
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.761
-Bye.
-Thank you.

03:45.850 --> 03:46.935
Isn't it heavy?

03:47.018 --> 03:49.020
-It's fine.
-I'll carry one.

03:49.103 --> 03:50.438
It's fine.

03:55.652 --> 03:56.611
Aren't you tired?

03:59.030 --> 04:00.156
I'm okay.

04:05.578 --> 04:06.537
Let's go.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.082
Right…

04:12.085 --> 04:16.714
EPISODE 7: I KNOW THERE'S NO TURNING BACK.
NEVERTHELESS,

04:30.561 --> 04:32.814
Excuse me. Where's the Mansari Temple?

04:32.897 --> 04:34.190
-The temple?
-Yes.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.151
-Go that way.
-Keep going that way.

04:37.235 --> 04:38.236
Oh, all right.

05:44.218 --> 05:46.054
Are you sleeping here with your friends?

05:46.137 --> 05:48.181
No, I'm going to sleep at my aunt's.

05:49.390 --> 05:52.769
Really? Then I'll take you home.
I need to tell you something.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.145
Tell me what?

05:54.228 --> 05:55.521
I'll tell you later.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.580
Do-hyeok, where should I put this?

06:12.663 --> 06:15.291
Over there. No, I'll put that away.

06:52.411 --> 06:54.914
Hello. I'm Park Jae-eon.

06:56.999 --> 06:59.001
Hello. I'm Yang Do-hyeok.

07:05.341 --> 07:07.426
The weather is so nice today!

07:07.510 --> 07:09.762
What? You said you weren't coming.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.013
Na-bi!

07:11.973 --> 07:15.143
Hello. I'm Na-bi's friend, Oh Bit-na.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.770
-It's nice to meet you.
-Welcome.

07:17.854 --> 07:20.231
I'm enjoying your videos too.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.233
I see. Thank you.

07:22.316 --> 07:23.609
It's really cool.

07:24.235 --> 07:25.653
-Hello.
-Hello.

07:25.736 --> 07:27.613
-Welcome, everyone.
-I'm Se-yeong.

07:27.697 --> 07:30.074
You said you weren't close.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.159
When did you get here?

07:31.242 --> 07:33.953
It's not like that.
My aunt lives nearby, that's all.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.831
So there was a reason
why she was out of touch.

07:36.914 --> 07:39.041
-It's nothing like that.
-Come on.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.544
Excuse me, Do-hyeok.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.880
-Where should I sleep?
-Where do we put our stuff?

07:43.963 --> 07:45.089
My shoulders hurt.

07:45.173 --> 07:48.426
She's going around so casually
as if it's her own home.

07:48.509 --> 07:50.178
-Jeez.
-Let's go.

07:52.763 --> 07:54.807
-Hey, I want the big room!
-That's mine!

07:54.891 --> 07:57.894
-It takes forever to take off my shoes.
-Let's get some rest here.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.230
Where are the keys?

08:02.064 --> 08:03.149
Did you bring them?

08:04.442 --> 08:05.526
Jeez.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.614
Are you okay?

08:11.407 --> 08:13.493
-What do you mean?
-Sorry I lied to you.

08:13.576 --> 08:17.455
I thought you'd say you wouldn't come
if I told you he was coming.

08:18.456 --> 08:19.999
It's fine.

08:24.754 --> 08:25.922
But…

08:27.715 --> 08:30.009
What happened with you and Jae-eon?

08:30.718 --> 08:32.845
You two seemed to be getting along well.

08:35.223 --> 08:37.266
-Well--
-He did something wrong

08:37.350 --> 08:39.101
like last time at the station, right?

08:39.685 --> 08:41.521
I can totally imagine it.

08:41.604 --> 08:42.855
No.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.777
I'm the one who made a mistake.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.241
He's probably pretty upset.

08:53.991 --> 08:54.951
Oh.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.037
I'll help you.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.630
I got two rooms prepared.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.340
First, this one.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.053
And this way.

09:14.136 --> 09:16.347
-It's so nice.
-Should we sleep here?

09:16.430 --> 09:17.974
Give me my bag.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.226
What about the guys' room?

09:22.478 --> 09:24.564
This place is so pretty.

09:24.647 --> 09:26.857
-Hey, let's sleep here!
-Is this the guys' room?

09:29.026 --> 09:30.695
Come this way.

09:31.362 --> 09:33.072
Can you wait just a minute?

09:35.575 --> 09:36.742
-Ji-wan.
-Yes?

09:41.872 --> 09:44.584
If you tell me an hour before
starting the barbecue,

09:44.667 --> 09:46.419
-I'll get everything prepared.
-Okay.

09:46.502 --> 09:48.546
-What are you doing later?
-What?

09:48.629 --> 09:51.465
We're all Na-bi's friends.
Come hang out with us.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.092
We're going to the amusement park.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.303
I have to prepare the food.

09:55.386 --> 09:58.347
Come on. We can all prepare it
together when we come back.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.558
You can take some photos
and hang out with us.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.435
Oh, right. You have a YouTube channel.

10:02.518 --> 10:04.270
I bet you'll be a good photographer.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.775
-Then hang on.
-Okay.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.652
Is he going to talk to Na-bi?

10:14.030 --> 10:16.616
What are you doing here?
I can take care of this.

10:16.699 --> 10:19.201
I have nothing to do, anyway.
Did you talk to everyone?

10:19.285 --> 10:20.661
Yes.

10:20.745 --> 10:23.331
They asked me to come
to the amusement park too.

10:24.498 --> 10:26.500
If you don't want to,
I'll tell them for you.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.128
No. I want to hang out with you.

10:30.546 --> 10:31.839
All right, then.

10:32.923 --> 10:33.966
Okay.

10:36.052 --> 10:39.263
Wasn't that kind of rude?
You put him in a tight spot.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.474
I was only asking him to hang out.

10:41.557 --> 10:44.310
Let's ask him to eat barbecue with us too!

10:47.355 --> 10:49.148
I already feel exhausted.

10:49.231 --> 10:51.442
What are you on about?
It's just the beginning!

10:51.525 --> 10:52.985
You can't get exhausted!

10:54.737 --> 10:57.073
-But why isn't Na-bi coming?
-I know.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.408
Let's just go first.
We don't have seats anyway.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.785
You can go by yourself.

11:00.868 --> 11:02.286
Se-hun!

11:03.329 --> 11:04.747
-Should we go?
-Let's go.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.209
Jae-eon. Bring Na-bi later then.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.423
-Be careful.
-Okay. Go first.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.925
Se-hun, hurry up.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.259
Let's go.

11:18.219 --> 11:19.470
Wait for me.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.278
Get in. Everyone left first.

11:56.632 --> 11:58.134
Why are you sitting at the back?

12:00.970 --> 12:03.681
Hang on. Do-hyeok's coming soon.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.676
Unbelievable.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.015
THE ALARM WILL RING IN 5 MINUTES

12:47.099 --> 12:49.143
How many alarms did you set?

12:52.730 --> 12:55.524
Gyeong-jun. Get up.
Your alarms are ringing.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.277
Why do you set your alarms on the weekend?

13:04.074 --> 13:05.367
It's so strange.

13:06.368 --> 13:09.413
Whenever he takes his glasses off…

13:25.971 --> 13:27.473
I…

13:28.265 --> 13:31.685
Why do you set so many alarms?
I always wake up because of them.

13:32.728 --> 13:35.773
I'm worried I'll keep sleeping
without hearing them.

13:35.856 --> 13:38.609
I'll wake you up,
so just set two alarms, okay?

13:39.360 --> 13:41.654
Really? Okay, then.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.077
Yes?

13:48.160 --> 13:50.037
<i>You're still looking for a place, right?</i>

13:50.120 --> 13:52.039
<i>There's one out. Come and check it.</i>

13:52.122 --> 13:53.165
I see…

13:54.625 --> 13:57.127
There's a place?
All right, I'll head over.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.966
Who was that? What place?

14:02.049 --> 14:05.761
It was the real estate agent.
There's a decent place.

14:09.390 --> 14:13.477
I was going to stay only until
I found a place, anyway.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.648
-Should I come with you?
-Aren't you busy?

14:17.731 --> 14:20.985
I'd appreciate it, but it's the weekend.

14:21.068 --> 14:23.362
It's fine.
I like looking around for a house.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.907
Then dinner's on me tonight.
What do you want?

14:26.991 --> 14:29.785
Well… <i>Tteokbokki</i>?

14:30.870 --> 14:31.871
Again?

14:33.038 --> 14:34.790
I thought you liked <i>tteokbokki</i>.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.086
What?

14:41.046 --> 14:42.214
Wear your glasses.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.217
I have to wash my face.

15:08.949 --> 15:10.910
I heard you met Seol-a at school.

15:12.953 --> 15:13.913
Yes.

15:14.496 --> 15:15.956
She said you were attractive.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.792
She wanted to talk to you more,
but you left.

15:20.878 --> 15:23.672
I thought she was pretty too.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.573
The door lock was too old.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.118
And did you see the mold? It's terrible.

15:53.202 --> 15:55.871
Stop that. The house was pretty decent.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.456
What do you mean?

15:57.539 --> 16:00.000
Just say it
if there's something not to your liking.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.336
-Stop it.
-Is it really urgent?

16:02.419 --> 16:04.713
I worked so hard to find a place for you.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.299
Your husband's complaining so much.

16:07.883 --> 16:08.884
My husband?

16:09.760 --> 16:12.096
-He's not my husband.
-He's not?

16:12.179 --> 16:14.223
He was so picky,
I thought you were a couple.

16:14.890 --> 16:16.308
What will you do, then?

16:16.392 --> 16:18.435
I'm sure you know,
but this is a rare chance.

16:20.270 --> 16:22.690
Think about it properly.
There are lots of problems.

16:23.273 --> 16:24.608
It seemed fine.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.986
You don't like it either, right?

16:27.069 --> 16:28.237
What?

16:28.320 --> 16:30.364
Sorry, but we'll think about it some more.

16:30.447 --> 16:32.574
My goodness. All right, then.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.410
You might lose your chance, though.

16:34.493 --> 16:35.494
Goodness.

16:37.454 --> 16:40.708
Hey. It was totally fine.

16:40.791 --> 16:43.043
You saw the mold. There was too much.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.712
Let's go. Come on.

16:44.795 --> 16:45.838
Let's go.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.719
-Can you get me a doll?
-That one?

16:51.802 --> 16:54.221
Yes, that one! The huge one over there.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.099
SHOOTING RANGE
BASEBALL THROW, BALLOON DARTS

16:58.308 --> 16:59.852
I'm leaving.

16:59.935 --> 17:01.854
-This is easy.
-You guys try it too!

17:01.937 --> 17:03.731
-Watch me.
-I'll show you my skills.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.441
-Let's make a bet.
-Okay, then.

17:05.524 --> 17:06.775
What are you doing here?

17:07.359 --> 17:09.319
This is so fun!

17:09.403 --> 17:10.779
Gosh.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.198
Na-bi, you try it too.
I'll take a photo of you.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.576
I'm not sure I can do it.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.704
Let me show you something cool.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.497
Look at your posture. It's so bad.

17:25.753 --> 17:26.628
Hang on.

17:28.672 --> 17:30.007
That's a strike.

17:38.599 --> 17:41.018
-Isn't this fun? Did you win that?
-Yes!

17:46.607 --> 17:48.233
Are you going to do this?

18:00.496 --> 18:02.247
-You got it!
-I got it.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.792
You got it! He got it!

18:04.875 --> 18:05.709
He hit it!

18:08.128 --> 18:09.963
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.592
He won that.

18:13.675 --> 18:15.636
That's my favorite character…

18:15.719 --> 18:18.889
Na-bi, that's my favorite character…

18:20.265 --> 18:21.767
Of course. It's okay.

18:23.102 --> 18:26.105
Thank you so much! Oh, my gosh! Sol, look!

18:48.001 --> 18:49.169
Stop!

18:49.670 --> 18:52.381
Hey, stop there. Hey!

18:52.464 --> 18:54.883
-Go!
-Hey!

18:56.468 --> 18:59.012
Why did you have to come with me?

19:00.389 --> 19:03.350
Security is the most important,
but it didn't look that safe.

19:03.433 --> 19:05.310
The neighborhood too.

19:05.394 --> 19:06.812
It seemed pretty dangerous.

19:06.895 --> 19:08.647
It'll cost more money for that.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.109
What if someone takes that house?

19:12.192 --> 19:14.528
Should I just say I'll take it?

19:15.904 --> 19:17.281
I'm just going to take it.

19:18.740 --> 19:19.783
Hey.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.201
You didn't like it, either.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.579
Of course, it's not as good as your house.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.998
Then you can keep staying at my house.

19:31.461 --> 19:32.671
Enjoy.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.090
Oh. Thank you.

19:38.385 --> 19:40.137
Wait, my phone.

19:41.930 --> 19:43.891
It's my first time actually riding this.

19:44.683 --> 19:45.642
Me too.

19:46.268 --> 19:48.437
It'll be so nice since the sun's setting.

19:49.646 --> 19:51.607
Na-bi. Isn't this a great photo?

19:53.108 --> 19:54.860
Yes. That's a great shot.

19:54.943 --> 19:58.655
I'll print this photo,
and the ones from the beach last time.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.911
It's all right.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.623
Let's take a nice selfie up there.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.459
-Okay?
-It's going to be so pretty.

20:15.672 --> 20:18.425
Four people can ride one, so ride with us.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.136
Can you take photos for us?

20:21.220 --> 20:22.387
-Come on.
-Join us.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.973
-Okay?
-It's going to be so fun.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.490
Next four, please.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.784
We'll take the next one with our friends.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.452
Then you two, come up.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.643
I don't want to ride this.

21:09.726 --> 21:11.478
-What?
-I'll wait here.

21:11.561 --> 21:12.646
Why?

21:12.729 --> 21:15.232
I'm afraid of heights.

21:15.315 --> 21:17.818
Oh, really?

21:17.901 --> 21:21.697
Then let's wait here together.
I'm afraid of heights too.

21:22.197 --> 21:24.908
-All right.
-You're such cowards.

21:25.492 --> 21:28.704
Will you be okay?
You're afraid of heights too.

21:28.787 --> 21:31.415
I'm fine. We came all the way here,
so I should ride it.

21:31.498 --> 21:33.625
Plus, it's not a scary ride.

21:36.086 --> 21:37.921
Really? Okay, I'll ride it with you.

21:38.005 --> 21:41.091
Really? Nice. Let's go.

21:41.174 --> 21:43.260
Hey, there's Jin-su.

21:43.343 --> 21:44.469
Hi, Jin-su!

21:52.644 --> 21:54.354
We can see the ocean!

21:55.856 --> 21:58.817
-Can you take a photo of me?
-Me too!

21:58.900 --> 22:01.528
-Count to three.
-One, two, three.

22:01.611 --> 22:03.905
One, two, three.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.907
Don't lean back!

22:05.991 --> 22:08.994
-I want one just by myself.
-Move!

22:09.077 --> 22:10.412
One, two, three.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.080
Move out of the way.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.957
Can you take one of me?

22:14.458 --> 22:15.876
One, two, three.

22:18.670 --> 22:21.798
-Hey, let's take one together.
-It's dangerous. Just stay still.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.428
Why do you have to talk like that?

23:01.505 --> 23:03.131
It's so pretty.

23:12.808 --> 23:14.351
Right. So pretty.

23:34.162 --> 23:35.455
You should see the view.

23:36.873 --> 23:39.167
Right. I am.

23:41.837 --> 23:42.921
Are you scared?

23:44.714 --> 23:47.634
It's slower than I thought.
It's kind of scary.

23:48.385 --> 23:49.344
Jeez.

23:51.221 --> 23:53.140
Oh, my gosh!

23:53.223 --> 23:57.018
Look at the view! I bet
we can see the guesthouse from here.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.478
Really? Where?

23:59.354 --> 24:02.440
Over there. This is amazing.

24:03.608 --> 24:06.444
Hey, stop that.

24:06.528 --> 24:09.030
Right. Sorry. Let's sit.

24:11.074 --> 24:12.659
But you know,

24:12.742 --> 24:15.996
the thrill of riding Ferris wheels
is in the shaking.

24:17.372 --> 24:18.748
Sorry.

24:21.334 --> 24:23.753
But Sol. You're jealous of us, aren't you?

24:23.837 --> 24:26.089
-Stop it.
-I'm really sorry.

24:34.389 --> 24:36.183
We can get off soon, so hang in there.

24:36.266 --> 24:40.437
What? Right. But I'm okay now.

24:41.938 --> 24:42.814
Really?

24:42.898 --> 24:44.816
Yes. I'm fine.

25:13.845 --> 25:17.224
I heard other Ferris wheels have music.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.935
I guess there's no music here.

25:25.148 --> 25:26.942
Why are you looking at me?

25:27.859 --> 25:30.403
-Look outside.
-How have you been?

25:30.987 --> 25:32.113
Fine.

25:33.323 --> 25:34.574
So-so.

25:34.658 --> 25:36.284
I haven't been well.

25:42.791 --> 25:45.335
-Sorry, I--
-Why didn't you contact me?

25:45.418 --> 25:46.711
What?

25:49.589 --> 25:51.508
-I…
-It was my birthday.

25:53.134 --> 25:55.512
You have lots of people to wish you
a happy birthday.

26:00.767 --> 26:02.185
<i>I can't waver again.</i>

26:02.269 --> 26:04.020
Anyway, I wanted to say…

26:05.522 --> 26:08.441
that I'm sorry for being harsh to Seol-a.

26:30.130 --> 26:31.131
I wanted

26:32.382 --> 26:34.301
to hear you say happy birthday to me.

26:54.321 --> 26:56.531
<i>His familiar smells</i>

26:57.824 --> 26:59.784
<i>are haunting me.</i>

27:16.426 --> 27:18.219
You could have just told me instead.

27:22.098 --> 27:23.767
You're making me feel upset.

27:25.685 --> 27:27.228
Do you hate me that much?

27:51.378 --> 27:53.254
He should be back by now.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.882
Why is he taking so long
to just buy some beer?

27:55.965 --> 27:58.551
What took you so long?

27:58.635 --> 28:01.012
Did you go all the way
to a beer brewery or what?

28:02.764 --> 28:04.891
-Who are you?
-And who are you?

28:04.974 --> 28:07.185
Well, I'm…

28:10.563 --> 28:11.481
Mom!

28:12.607 --> 28:13.566
Mom?

28:17.529 --> 28:18.363
Hey.

28:19.114 --> 28:20.865
Do-yeon. Why are you here?

28:21.866 --> 28:23.034
To start the fire.

28:24.035 --> 28:26.079
Good job. But is that it?

28:26.162 --> 28:27.789
No. I was bored.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.290
I want to join you.

28:29.374 --> 28:32.419
Do-yeon, don't bother the guests.

28:32.502 --> 28:35.630
Hey, why are you so mean to her?
Did you fix the bike?

28:35.713 --> 28:36.756
-Yes.
-Is there meat?

28:36.840 --> 28:39.092
-The Ferris wheel…
-There's meat, but…

28:39.175 --> 28:40.593
-Who's the prettiest?
-The meat…

28:41.136 --> 28:43.263
Na-bi, who's that guy?

28:43.346 --> 28:45.473
Do I look like someone
who grew up cooking?

28:45.557 --> 28:47.600
-You're good at cooking meat.
-Yes, I am.

28:48.643 --> 28:49.894
He's my junior.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.730
He's not a theater major?

28:52.313 --> 28:54.691
I should transfer to your university.

28:57.819 --> 28:58.987
Hello.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.947
Hi. I'm Yang Do-yeon.

29:04.868 --> 29:07.162
Hi, I'm Park Jae-eon.

29:09.372 --> 29:12.625
-Hello.
-Hello.

29:12.709 --> 29:13.960
Hello.

29:14.711 --> 29:16.296
Na-bi, can you help me?

29:17.297 --> 29:19.048
All right.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.010
Did you have dinner?

29:22.093 --> 29:24.262
I already unbuckled my belt.

29:24.345 --> 29:25.597
You have to cook the meat.

29:26.681 --> 29:28.183
I'm going to unbuckle my belt.

29:28.266 --> 29:29.642
No, I haven't eaten yet.

29:29.726 --> 29:31.519
Then we can eat together.

29:38.234 --> 29:40.612
-Alcohol? Yes, I like drinking.
-Have a shot.

29:40.695 --> 29:43.281
-Do you like drinking?
-Yes. What kind do you like?

29:43.364 --> 29:46.117
I like soju.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.369
Oh, would you like some?

29:48.453 --> 29:49.746
Shall we?

29:53.875 --> 29:56.461
-Let me pour you a shot.
-Thank you.

29:57.086 --> 29:58.463
Just a little.

30:03.218 --> 30:04.844
Cheers.

30:13.561 --> 30:16.397
How are you so good at taking photos?

30:16.481 --> 30:17.524
Seriously.

30:17.607 --> 30:20.860
Do-hyeok,
can I see the photos you took earlier?

30:20.944 --> 30:24.280
You're such a good photographer.
But I look awful in this one.

30:24.364 --> 30:26.074
Oh, Jin-su!

30:26.157 --> 30:28.159
This one's nice, right?

30:28.243 --> 30:29.661
-Gosh.
-Awesome.

30:29.744 --> 30:31.913
I'll send the photos to your emails later.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.791
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

30:34.874 --> 30:36.376
Can we look?

30:36.459 --> 30:37.919
Sure. Go ahead.

30:38.419 --> 30:39.963
Look at this.

30:40.046 --> 30:42.131
-Hey.
-This photo's nice.

30:42.215 --> 30:44.926
I just got two of these.

30:45.009 --> 30:46.928
-This doesn't look like you at all.
-Here.

30:47.011 --> 30:50.682
You'll feel really refreshed
the next morning after you eat this.

30:50.765 --> 30:52.141
I see.

30:56.229 --> 30:58.606
-What do you think?
-You look pretty.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.109
-He's an amazing photographer.
-Right.

31:01.943 --> 31:04.112
-Is that a compliment?
-You look really nice.

31:04.612 --> 31:07.198
Do-hyeok took this photo
at the Ferris wheel.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.450
Don't forget that I gave this to you.

31:11.327 --> 31:12.787
Let's clink glasses.

31:14.622 --> 31:17.000
-You're drinking without eating anything?
-Come on.

31:17.083 --> 31:19.252
-Cheers. Come on.
-Jeez.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.634
Unbelievable.

31:30.179 --> 31:31.723
This is so nice.

31:33.182 --> 31:35.643
Sol. Meat!

31:35.727 --> 31:36.853
It's almost done.

31:37.437 --> 31:39.814
You're not even helping them.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.357
I'm so hungry.

31:41.441 --> 31:42.859
Sol. Need any help?

31:44.027 --> 31:45.987
-No, it's fine.
-Is everything okay?

31:46.070 --> 31:47.322
You need any help?

31:47.405 --> 31:49.240
Just stay back. You're bothering us.

31:49.741 --> 31:51.826
"Just stay back. You're bothering us."

31:53.161 --> 31:55.705
Hey, just sit quietly
and don't bother Sol.

31:55.788 --> 31:57.123
What about the meat?

31:59.500 --> 32:00.585
Sit down comfortably.

32:00.668 --> 32:02.337
You're so kind.

32:02.420 --> 32:03.880
-What…
-Chopsticks.

32:07.800 --> 32:10.053
Anyone want to drink with Ji-wan?

32:10.929 --> 32:12.472
Nobody?

32:12.555 --> 32:15.266
I'm so lonely.

32:26.903 --> 32:28.529
There's no alcohol…

32:32.617 --> 32:35.662
What about me?

32:35.745 --> 32:37.330
His photos are amazing.

32:47.090 --> 32:49.634
-Here.
-You can keep looking.

32:49.717 --> 32:51.678
-All right.
-It's so…

32:58.267 --> 32:59.894
Do you like the moon?

33:01.229 --> 33:02.271
Yes.

33:03.147 --> 33:05.858
Do you like the crescent moon
or the full moon?

33:05.942 --> 33:06.818
-I just…
-Sol!

33:06.901 --> 33:08.152
Put it there.

33:08.236 --> 33:09.904
…like it if it's pretty.

33:21.541 --> 33:25.670
<i>He really has nothing to do with me now,
but why…</i>

33:25.753 --> 33:27.088
Are you jealous?

33:27.755 --> 33:29.090
Show them to me next time.

33:29.173 --> 33:30.425
I will. Come and visit.

33:31.175 --> 33:32.260
What are you on about?

33:33.928 --> 33:36.556
Jae-eon has a new target now.

33:37.432 --> 33:39.058
I don't care.

33:45.106 --> 33:46.774
What is it this time?

33:46.858 --> 33:49.235
Why do you keep avoiding him?

33:52.155 --> 33:54.282
-When did I avoid him?
-Don't lie.

33:54.365 --> 33:57.952
I should know what's going on
to keep things in order.

33:58.536 --> 34:01.873
Okay? Everyone's here to have a fun time.

34:01.956 --> 34:03.458
You two keep ruining the vibe.

34:06.169 --> 34:07.754
I'll be careful.

34:07.837 --> 34:10.798
So tell me. Did something happen
with him at the Ferris wheel?

34:11.382 --> 34:13.843
No. We were just looking at the view.

34:13.926 --> 34:15.094
You're such a bad liar.

34:15.178 --> 34:18.014
Nothing happened, okay?
Stop jumping to conclusions.

34:20.099 --> 34:22.143
Is it because of Do-hyeok?

34:23.478 --> 34:25.229
He's charming.

34:25.855 --> 34:27.607
I wouldn't mind if you went after him.

34:34.113 --> 34:35.656
Jae-eon has a girlfriend.

34:35.740 --> 34:37.575
-What?
-Be quiet.

34:38.284 --> 34:39.160
Really?

34:40.244 --> 34:41.370
Who?

34:42.080 --> 34:45.583
I don't know. But he does,
so stop talking about us like that.

34:46.709 --> 34:48.753
What? That's impossible.

34:49.337 --> 34:50.963
Are you sure about that?

34:51.047 --> 34:53.216
He could he… There's no way.

34:53.299 --> 34:54.717
That's enough. Just take this.

34:57.261 --> 34:59.472
A girlfriend? For real?

35:01.724 --> 35:03.476
Come over here.

35:03.559 --> 35:04.644
Excuse me.

35:06.354 --> 35:07.396
Hey, Na-bi.

35:07.480 --> 35:10.233
There's some left.
We can put this back in the kitchen.

35:11.275 --> 35:13.945
They look like newlyweds.

35:15.196 --> 35:17.240
I hope you have a happy marriage!

35:18.241 --> 35:21.911
Hey, Yu Se-hun. You're so ridiculous.

35:21.994 --> 35:23.746
-What?
-Are you that clueless?

35:23.830 --> 35:25.456
What about me?

35:25.540 --> 35:26.916
Are you drunk?

35:28.209 --> 35:31.379
Do-hyeok. How did you come to know Na-bi?

35:34.257 --> 35:36.884
We were childhood neighborhood friends.

35:38.302 --> 35:40.888
I love stories like that!

35:40.972 --> 35:44.892
Childhood friends, first love,
stuff like that.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.561
It's like a romance drama!

35:46.644 --> 35:48.229
-Just like a drama.
-It's not like that.

35:48.312 --> 35:49.147
I know.

35:53.651 --> 35:57.071
It's true that Na-bi is my first love.

35:58.239 --> 35:59.532
What?

35:59.615 --> 36:01.909
-You should get married!
-I'm jealous.

36:01.993 --> 36:06.205
-You should get married!
-You should get married!

36:06.289 --> 36:09.208
-You should get married!
-You should get married!

36:09.292 --> 36:10.585
What? Are you drunk?

36:10.668 --> 36:12.003
It's true, though.

36:12.086 --> 36:14.005
Will you accept my proposal?

36:14.088 --> 36:16.674
-My dear.
-You only know him, right?

36:17.425 --> 36:18.384
I'll do it.

36:41.449 --> 36:43.075
Your girlfriend?

36:44.160 --> 36:45.286
Yes.

36:46.245 --> 36:48.122
We haven't dated for long.

36:48.789 --> 36:51.167
About two, three… Three months.

36:51.250 --> 36:54.545
It's only been three months,
and you're living together?

36:56.380 --> 36:58.341
I begged her to move in.

37:00.092 --> 37:01.969
I really like her a lot.

37:24.242 --> 37:25.368
Thanks for this.

37:25.451 --> 37:28.621
All right. Enjoy the food. I'm leaving.

37:28.704 --> 37:30.331
I'm moving out soon.

37:30.998 --> 37:32.041
Already?

37:34.585 --> 37:35.753
Well…

37:36.462 --> 37:39.382
I know it's not easy to live
with someone else.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.550
Especially him.

37:41.634 --> 37:45.554
He's so nosy, but he doesn't know
how to take care of himself.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.515
-He even snores.
-Mom.

37:47.598 --> 37:51.477
No, Gyeong-jun is really good to me.

37:52.353 --> 37:55.481
I felt that he received a lot of love
since he is bright and kind.

37:55.564 --> 37:56.816
I guess I was right.

37:56.899 --> 38:00.736
My goodness. You're so sweet.

38:12.081 --> 38:14.959
<i>-Bit-na's favorite random game!
-Bit-na's favorite random game!</i>

38:15.042 --> 38:16.377
<i>-What game?
-What game?</i>

38:16.460 --> 38:18.754
<i>-Game, start.
-Game, start.</i>

38:18.838 --> 38:20.715
The Whisper Game. I'll start.

38:20.798 --> 38:23.050
-What is it?
-I don't know.

38:28.973 --> 38:30.766
-Seo Ji-wan.
-Really?

38:31.267 --> 38:32.852
-Me?
-You're not fooling us.

38:32.935 --> 38:34.395
No, it's really unexpected.

38:34.478 --> 38:36.105
What is it?

38:36.188 --> 38:37.315
What? What is it?

38:38.357 --> 38:39.942
This is really shocking.

38:40.026 --> 38:41.110
I'm so curious.

38:41.193 --> 38:42.445
This is tough.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.451
The question was, "Who's the ugliest one?"

38:49.076 --> 38:50.119
Come here, you jerk.

38:51.746 --> 38:53.289
Hey! You want to die?

38:53.873 --> 38:56.334
They'll fall in love
after squabbling like that.

38:56.417 --> 38:59.045
-What was the question?
-It's obvious.

38:59.628 --> 39:02.089
-You're not uncomfortable?
-It's fine.

39:02.173 --> 39:04.759
-I'm not ugly!
-I'm sorry!

39:04.842 --> 39:07.887
I'll just reveal the question.
"Who's the ugliest one here?"

39:09.180 --> 39:11.098
-I knew it!
-I knew it!

39:12.224 --> 39:15.102
-That's so childish.
-This game's supposed to be childish.

39:15.770 --> 39:16.937
I'm going to beat you up!

39:19.940 --> 39:22.026
All right. It's my turn.

39:22.109 --> 39:23.402
She's so drunk.

39:30.576 --> 39:31.994
The noodle shop grandson.

39:32.661 --> 39:36.624
Really? I can't believe it!

39:36.707 --> 39:39.251
What? What was the question?

39:39.335 --> 39:41.796
Honey. It's so obvious.

39:42.421 --> 39:45.007
Guys, it's so obvious.
There's no point in drinking.

39:45.091 --> 39:49.095
That's what I mean. It's too obvious.

39:49.178 --> 39:52.098
Gyu-hyun,
why would you want to know the question?

39:52.181 --> 39:55.518
Right. It's nothing. Why would you drink?

39:55.601 --> 39:57.353
I'm just curious.

39:57.436 --> 40:01.732
All right, the question
I asked Bit-na was,

40:04.985 --> 40:07.530
"Who's your ideal type
among the people here?"

40:10.991 --> 40:14.078
Okay. Anything you want to know, Do-hyeok?

40:23.796 --> 40:26.799
Who makes you smile the most
among the people here?

40:29.301 --> 40:30.428
You.

40:32.471 --> 40:35.224
I knew it!

40:36.851 --> 40:39.728
What is it? What's the question?

40:39.812 --> 40:42.690
-What is it?
-I knew it!

40:42.773 --> 40:44.692
Let me hear the question!

40:45.484 --> 40:46.944
What is it?

40:47.027 --> 40:48.070
Let's let this slide.

40:48.154 --> 40:50.239
-No!
-Okay, let's let it slide.

40:50.322 --> 40:51.615
You can ask instead of me.

40:51.699 --> 40:54.785
Me? Okay, I'll do it.

40:56.162 --> 40:57.705
My question is,

40:57.788 --> 41:00.708
"Who is the prettiest here?"

41:00.791 --> 41:02.877
Se-yeong, of course.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.128
Then it's my turn again.

41:04.211 --> 41:06.630
-Who's the loveliest one?
<i>-I'm leaving for a minute.</i>

41:06.714 --> 41:09.341
<i>-Bring the others to the beach later.</i>
-You, Se-yeong.

41:09.425 --> 41:11.051
-Jeez.
-Excuse me.

41:11.135 --> 41:13.179
-Stop it.
-Where are you going?

41:14.180 --> 41:15.431
What about you, Do-yeon?

41:16.348 --> 41:17.308
Well…

41:43.959 --> 41:45.294
Yu Na-bi.

42:04.313 --> 42:05.564
What is it?

42:06.106 --> 42:06.941
What?

42:07.608 --> 42:09.902
-What's that reaction?
-Right.

42:10.486 --> 42:12.321
Is she drinking out of jealousy?

42:12.404 --> 42:14.240
I should drink for this one.

42:14.323 --> 42:15.824
-Me too!
-Me too.

42:15.908 --> 42:17.117
Me too.

42:21.705 --> 42:22.623
What's the question?

42:25.709 --> 42:27.253
Me!

42:30.005 --> 42:32.800
-Oh, my gosh!
-Let's stop. This is boring.

42:33.425 --> 42:37.763
Hey, guys. Let's stop playing games
and just chat.

42:37.846 --> 42:40.474
Why? This is fun. Let's continue.

42:41.141 --> 42:42.393
Come on!

42:42.476 --> 42:46.230
Sol. Why does Ji-wan always act
like she's tough? She always gets drunk.

42:46.313 --> 42:48.274
She gets drunk faster
when drinking outside.

42:48.357 --> 42:49.650
Give me that.

42:49.733 --> 42:51.443
Stop drinking.

42:51.527 --> 42:55.114
You're such close friends.
You know everything about each other.

42:55.197 --> 42:58.909
Well, we've been close friends
since middle school.

43:00.119 --> 43:02.830
Was Ji-wan popular in middle school?

43:02.913 --> 43:05.916
She says boys were lining up to date her.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.043
Yes. She was popular.

43:09.712 --> 43:10.754
She's pretty.

43:10.838 --> 43:14.341
Hey! You must be drunk.

43:15.009 --> 43:18.512
She's just a bit charming,

43:18.596 --> 43:20.806
to be generous.

43:20.889 --> 43:24.685
It's true. Guys always hit on her
even when she had a boyfriend.

43:25.269 --> 43:28.188
I told you, Bit-na! I wasn't lying!

43:28.772 --> 43:31.984
I was really pretty, I'm telling you!

43:32.067 --> 43:34.486
I was one
of the prettiest girls in school!

43:34.570 --> 43:35.654
Hey.

43:36.572 --> 43:38.198
She's the prettiest.

43:38.282 --> 43:39.700
What's with you? Stop it.

43:39.783 --> 43:41.493
-What?
-Jeez.

43:41.577 --> 43:43.996
You guys are all looking down on me.

43:44.079 --> 43:46.582
Sol. Have you ever dated anyone?

43:46.665 --> 43:50.753
Yu Se-hun, stop it.

43:50.836 --> 43:54.173
Sol doesn't like you!

43:54.256 --> 43:56.216
Shut up. Why are you so clueless?

43:56.300 --> 43:57.926
-I should take her to bed.
-Me?

43:58.510 --> 44:00.262
Gosh, she's so noisy.

44:00.346 --> 44:02.389
I want to hang out with you!

44:03.349 --> 44:04.642
She's so noisy!

44:05.225 --> 44:07.811
I want to keep playing games.

44:08.437 --> 44:11.106
Guys! I want to go shoot fireworks too!

44:11.190 --> 44:13.567
Why did you drink so much?

44:14.360 --> 44:16.612
Do you want a hangover like last time?

44:17.821 --> 44:19.615
That was my mistake.

44:19.698 --> 44:22.326
Just get some sleep, okay?

44:23.202 --> 44:26.789
-Sol! My friend Sol!
-Hey.

44:26.872 --> 44:28.957
-Let go of me.
-My old friend.

44:29.041 --> 44:30.417
Let me go.

44:42.513 --> 44:45.516
What's with you?
Stop drinking from now on.

44:46.308 --> 44:47.142
Sol.

44:52.022 --> 44:53.565
Can you hold my hand again?

45:11.959 --> 45:13.669
I like you the most.

45:15.212 --> 45:17.172
I like you more than my mom and dad.

45:17.756 --> 45:19.716
You're my favorite person in the world.

45:21.427 --> 45:22.553
What about you?

45:23.679 --> 45:25.305
Who's your favorite person?

45:27.433 --> 45:29.268
Stop the nonsense. Go to sleep.

45:29.351 --> 45:32.020
Do you have feelings for that guy?
Ju-hyeok?

45:33.856 --> 45:36.650
Or Yu Se-hun? I don't want you to.

45:37.359 --> 45:38.944
Because…

45:40.779 --> 45:42.614
I just don't like it.

45:45.534 --> 45:47.744
Don't hang out with anyone else.

45:48.328 --> 45:51.165
Just like me, okay?

45:52.374 --> 45:55.836
Just me. Please.

45:57.087 --> 46:01.133
Please, Sol. Only like me.

46:04.595 --> 46:05.679
Seo Ji-wan.

46:09.057 --> 46:12.895
Stop making me get my hopes up.

47:00.067 --> 47:02.236
<i>-So exciting! So fun!
-So exciting! So fun!</i>

47:05.489 --> 47:08.659
-Come on. Join us.
-No thanks.

47:08.742 --> 47:11.078
What's gotten into you?
Is something going on?

47:11.161 --> 47:14.540
He's right! You've changed!

47:14.623 --> 47:17.209
It seems like he's become
a bit sentimental.

47:18.210 --> 47:19.670
Are you going for a new image?

47:19.753 --> 47:21.797
Why? What was he like before?

47:21.880 --> 47:24.633
Jae-eon was incredible. As you can see.

47:24.716 --> 47:26.093
You know, he's so handsome.

47:27.094 --> 47:28.470
What's going on?

47:29.221 --> 47:34.560
Or has he finally found his soulmate?

47:42.651 --> 47:45.988
He's suddenly drinking!

47:46.071 --> 47:48.073
<i>-Who's the target?
-Who's the target?</i>

47:48.156 --> 47:49.950
<i>-Who is it?
-Who is it?</i>

47:50.033 --> 47:52.661
Let's stop. Let's just go to the beach.

47:52.744 --> 47:56.164
-You wanted to watch fireworks.
-Come on. Everyone was curious.

47:56.873 --> 48:01.003
Everyone was gossiping about whether
Jae-eon met his soulmate or something.

48:01.712 --> 48:04.506
Jae-eon,
why don't you just tell us honestly?

48:04.590 --> 48:06.883
Is there a girl who's captured your heart?

48:06.967 --> 48:09.428
-Is there?
-Is there?

48:13.890 --> 48:14.766
Yes.

48:16.643 --> 48:20.731
Then would you like to kiss her?

48:20.814 --> 48:23.483
-Would you?
-Would you?

48:26.820 --> 48:27.821
Are you guys drunk?

48:33.201 --> 48:35.537
Bit-na, stop it.

48:37.331 --> 48:39.082
Let's just keep playing games.

48:39.166 --> 48:42.085
Come on. This is all a game too.

48:42.169 --> 48:44.046
All right, Jae-eon.

48:44.129 --> 48:47.799
Is that girl here with us right now?

48:47.883 --> 48:51.094
-Is she?
-Is she?

48:58.018 --> 48:59.061
-Don't move.
-You'll get hurt.

49:00.896 --> 49:02.064
Are you okay?

49:03.899 --> 49:05.317
-She's hurt.
-What do we do?

49:05.400 --> 49:07.110
-Don't touch it.
-Don't touch it!

49:07.778 --> 49:09.321
-She's hurt.
-Hey, she's hurt.

49:09.404 --> 49:12.115
The cut is deep. Let's get this treated.

49:12.741 --> 49:14.117
She's hurt.

49:14.743 --> 49:15.702
Are you…

49:16.328 --> 49:17.579
What do we do about this?

49:19.039 --> 49:21.375
-Be careful.
-You spilled that.

49:22.793 --> 49:23.960
It must hurt.

49:25.462 --> 49:26.588
Is it bad?

49:27.297 --> 49:28.924
I'm fine.

49:31.593 --> 49:35.806
The cut isn't too deep,
but we should still disinfect it.

49:39.393 --> 49:41.645
Gyu-hyun, take the others
to the beach first.

49:41.728 --> 49:43.188
We'll catch up later.

49:43.271 --> 49:44.815
Why? We can wait.

49:45.399 --> 49:47.442
Do-yeon's going to feel embarrassed.

49:47.526 --> 49:48.777
Right. Go on without us.

49:48.860 --> 49:52.114
Do-hyeok's already
setting up the fireworks at the beach.

49:53.532 --> 49:54.658
That's why he left.

49:55.492 --> 49:58.537
Don't tell Do-hyeok about this.

49:58.620 --> 49:59.746
We'll head over soon.

50:00.497 --> 50:02.708
All right, then. Be careful on the way.

50:03.417 --> 50:04.543
Okay.

50:05.127 --> 50:08.255
I totally ruined all the fun.

50:08.338 --> 50:10.590
You didn't. It's fine.

50:10.674 --> 50:13.677
Take antibiotics, just in case.

50:16.012 --> 50:17.222
By the way,

50:18.098 --> 50:21.226
what's your relationship to Jae-eon?

50:22.894 --> 50:24.146
There's nothing between us.

50:24.813 --> 50:26.440
It seemed like there was something.

50:26.523 --> 50:29.609
I mean it.
My friends just like teasing us.

50:30.277 --> 50:31.445
Really?

50:31.528 --> 50:34.489
He seemed
to have feelings for you, though.

50:37.951 --> 50:39.244
Why do you think that?

50:39.828 --> 50:41.621
During the Whisper Game,

50:42.414 --> 50:44.791
I asked Jae-eon

50:46.001 --> 50:50.046
who he wanted to kiss tonight.

51:02.100 --> 51:04.436
He's always like that.

51:05.061 --> 51:06.938
He's never sincere.

51:07.022 --> 51:08.899
You don't need to pay attention to that.

51:12.235 --> 51:13.779
All done.

51:16.072 --> 51:18.074
Let's go to the beach now.

51:18.658 --> 51:20.494
Well…

51:21.244 --> 51:23.205
I'm going to my aunt's house.

51:23.288 --> 51:27.125
Why? You should come.
Do-hyeok's probably waiting for you.

51:27.709 --> 51:31.129
I really want to, but I'm so tired.

51:32.339 --> 51:33.840
Go on and have fun.

51:33.924 --> 51:36.259
Okay. Then get some rest,
and see you tomorrow.

51:36.343 --> 51:37.677
Okay.

51:38.386 --> 51:40.347
Make sure to take antibiotics.

51:57.531 --> 52:00.325
-Come on.
-Hurry.

52:01.451 --> 52:03.787
Hey. Do this dance.

52:03.870 --> 52:06.331
Starting from that end. Go.

52:06.414 --> 52:07.958
Why are we doing this?

52:08.542 --> 52:10.418
I hate this!

52:12.337 --> 52:14.381
Why are we doing this?

52:15.340 --> 52:16.591
Am I doing this right?

52:17.592 --> 52:19.886
-Hey!
-Come on!

52:19.970 --> 52:21.763
This is so stupid!

52:21.847 --> 52:23.682
NA-BI

52:23.765 --> 52:25.141
Can you take a photo of me?

52:26.476 --> 52:27.936
-Sure.
-Hey, let's do this.

52:28.019 --> 52:30.355
Let's write "love" with these.

52:30.438 --> 52:31.481
Come on.

52:38.697 --> 52:40.907
-Thank you.
-I'll write "love."

52:40.991 --> 52:42.742
Can you take a photo of us too?

52:42.826 --> 52:44.286
You draw the heart.

52:44.369 --> 52:45.996
You have to get the heart.

52:46.079 --> 52:48.582
With the word "love" too.

52:48.665 --> 52:51.418
All right. One, two, three.

53:01.261 --> 53:03.054
Why are you sitting here all alone?

53:04.222 --> 53:06.933
I brought these to hang out with you.

53:10.353 --> 53:15.108
What is it? Why have you been
looking so upset the whole day?

53:15.191 --> 53:17.277
-Is it fun?
-What?

53:17.360 --> 53:20.447
Is it fun to tease people
and make them feel uncomfortable?

53:20.530 --> 53:21.990
What are you talking about?

53:22.073 --> 53:23.909
Like just now.

53:23.992 --> 53:26.411
You talk about others
just for your enjoyment.

53:27.037 --> 53:29.289
You're making other people
feel uncomfortable.

53:29.372 --> 53:31.416
So stop doing things like that.

53:31.499 --> 53:33.084
It's not like that.

53:33.168 --> 53:35.337
Everyone was whispering behind his back.

53:35.420 --> 53:37.172
So I just asked for them.

53:37.255 --> 53:39.966
Plus, it's obvious
that Na-bi and Jae-eon like each other.

53:40.050 --> 53:41.509
It's sad to see them like that.

53:44.095 --> 53:46.473
All right. Fine, I'll stop.

53:46.556 --> 53:47.974
I promise.

53:48.058 --> 53:50.769
Come on, try this.
I brought it so we could make up.

53:51.603 --> 53:52.771
Hold it,

53:52.854 --> 53:55.649
and if we light the end…

53:57.609 --> 53:58.526
Isn't it pretty?

54:03.073 --> 54:04.115
Look.

54:09.079 --> 54:11.748
Stop trying to justify yourself.

54:11.831 --> 54:13.750
You know it too.

54:18.672 --> 54:21.257
Stop playing games with me.

54:23.176 --> 54:25.553
What are you talking about?

54:25.637 --> 54:29.015
I started this knowing that
you thought of me as a joke.

54:29.099 --> 54:30.684
But I can't stand it anymore.

54:31.309 --> 54:32.394
What do you mean?

54:36.147 --> 54:37.357
Let's end this.

54:42.320 --> 54:44.030
Hey!

54:51.496 --> 54:52.914
Yang Do-hyeok!

54:54.708 --> 54:55.917
Do it like this.

54:56.001 --> 54:57.460
You're here.

54:58.670 --> 54:59.671
What happened?

55:00.588 --> 55:02.632
-I just got hurt a little.
-How?

55:02.716 --> 55:03.967
Is it bad?

55:04.050 --> 55:06.761
It's fine. Na-bi took good care of it.

55:06.845 --> 55:10.390
Gosh, it must hurt.
You should have been careful.

55:10.473 --> 55:12.267
Where's Na-bi?

55:12.851 --> 55:15.770
She said she's too tired to come.

55:15.854 --> 55:17.856
-She's not coming?
-Are you that upset?

55:20.275 --> 55:22.027
She went to her aunt's?

55:22.110 --> 55:24.237
Probably. Why?

55:25.864 --> 55:27.115
It's nothing.

55:28.283 --> 55:30.785
But where is Jae-eon?

55:38.543 --> 55:40.086
This is the worst.

55:41.171 --> 55:42.422
What is?

55:47.302 --> 55:49.888
Didn't you go to the beach
with the others?

55:51.765 --> 55:53.183
I came to see if you treated it.

55:56.352 --> 55:58.980
Don't worry. I treated her properly.

55:59.064 --> 56:01.608
Do-yeon just left. Didn't you see her?

56:06.362 --> 56:07.363
Why are you smiling?

56:14.662 --> 56:16.414
What are you doing?

56:17.415 --> 56:18.792
I meant you.

56:19.417 --> 56:20.960
You got hurt too.

56:22.253 --> 56:23.588
It's none of your business.

56:24.589 --> 56:25.840
It hurts, right?

56:28.593 --> 56:31.596
Stop drinking. You had enough already.

56:37.685 --> 56:39.771
Why would you care whether I drink or not?

56:42.148 --> 56:43.858
It's fine. I'll do it.

56:44.526 --> 56:47.070
-Let me do it.
-I said I'll do it.

56:51.282 --> 56:53.243
You get angry at me so often

56:53.326 --> 56:55.120
when you don't with others.

57:03.586 --> 57:05.797
<i>Why can't I ever refuse him?</i>

57:11.511 --> 57:14.722
<i>I feel like I'm going
to crumble down again.</i>

57:17.183 --> 57:18.810
You saw me get hurt?

57:19.894 --> 57:20.979
Of course I saw it.

57:22.105 --> 57:26.151
But you would have gotten angry
if I did something about it.

57:28.653 --> 57:29.946
You're ridiculous.

57:33.491 --> 57:35.743
I can't say
I didn't have other intentions.

57:43.251 --> 57:45.420
-Stop it.
-What?

57:47.380 --> 57:50.049
What you're doing right now.

57:53.303 --> 57:54.554
What am I doing?

57:56.055 --> 57:58.183
-Stop smiling.
-I can't even smile?

57:58.266 --> 58:00.393
Do you enjoy playing with me?

58:00.477 --> 58:03.563
Why did you say that in front
of the others? They'll misunderstand.

58:07.025 --> 58:08.401
Are you really asking

58:09.486 --> 58:10.737
because you don't know?

58:12.614 --> 58:14.407
I kept thinking about you.

58:16.201 --> 58:17.660
I missed you.

58:18.870 --> 58:20.830
Didn't you miss me?

58:31.299 --> 58:32.634
Do you hate me that much?

58:33.384 --> 58:35.094
You have a girlfriend.

58:35.178 --> 58:36.846
That's not the issue.

58:37.680 --> 58:39.933
Right. It has nothing to do with me.

58:40.016 --> 58:41.518
Then be honest.

58:42.894 --> 58:44.312
Let go of me.

58:51.528 --> 58:52.570
Running away again?

58:55.031 --> 58:56.449
I never ran away.

58:56.533 --> 58:58.576
Do you really want me to let go?

59:01.955 --> 59:03.331
Just tell me

59:04.040 --> 59:05.625
if you don't want this.

59:08.461 --> 59:10.213
Then I'll stop.

1:00:08.813 --> 1:00:10.607
YANG DO-HYEOK

1:00:22.243 --> 1:00:23.786
Is this really okay?

1:00:28.750 --> 1:00:30.293
If we continue,

1:00:32.003 --> 1:00:33.880
I don't think I can stop.

1:01:38.236 --> 1:01:43.157
Right now, I like you so much
that I don't know what to do.

1:01:43.241 --> 1:01:45.410
<i>I know exactly what my tears mean.</i>

1:01:45.493 --> 1:01:46.327
Did you sleep well?

1:01:46.411 --> 1:01:48.079
We didn't get to finish.

1:01:48.162 --> 1:01:49.831
<i>You must like her a lot.</i>

1:01:49.914 --> 1:01:51.332
Yes. Unlike someone.

1:01:52.166 --> 1:01:54.210
<i>Are you and Do-hyeok dating?</i>

1:01:54.293 --> 1:01:55.461
<i>He's such a coward.</i>

1:01:55.545 --> 1:01:57.255
Did you get an assistant?

1:01:57.338 --> 1:01:59.173
Yes. Didn't I tell you?

1:01:59.257 --> 1:02:01.634
<i>Why does it feel like I'm cheating?</i>

1:02:01.718 --> 1:02:03.970
<i>I heard you got scouted.</i>

1:02:04.053 --> 1:02:04.971
Are you going to America?

1:02:05.054 --> 1:02:06.681
<i>I'm going to give it some thought.</i>

1:02:06.764 --> 1:02:10.476
<i>I saw someone so beautiful here
that I fell in love at first sight.</i>

1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:12.228
I like you. Sincerely.

1:02:13.104 --> 1:02:15.690
<i>I don't ever want to disappoint Do-hyeok.</i>

1:02:15.773 --> 1:02:18.359
<i>Is Na-bi easily swayed by me?</i>

1:02:18.901 --> 1:02:23.573
