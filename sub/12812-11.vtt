WEBVTT

00:11.070 --> 00:13.561
We both killed Piper,
and now, he wants revenge
on both of us.

00:13.570 --> 00:16.334
The Sher/77‘ told me
that E// had broken
into some g/r/E; bedroom.

00:16.340 --> 00:18.535
Now, that we know
this [3‘ the thing E/i o’oes,

00:18.550 --> 00:20.177
you have to wonder
if he could be the one

00:20.180 --> 00:22.045
who keeps sneaking
into our rooms.

00:22.050 --> 00:23.142
(Groaning)

00:23.150 --> 00:26.677
This is about us.
It isn't about _Noah._
Why are you domg this?

00:26.690 --> 00:29.989
Itis more fun this way.
If you fol/ow my clues,

00:29.990 --> 00:31.981
maybe you can save
Noah is life.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.389
You brought Piper here!

00:33.390 --> 00:35.051
And why?
What did I do to you?

00:35.060 --> 00:36.084
Do you hear that?

00:36.100 --> 00:37.351
Emma:
Noah, can you hear us?

00:37.360 --> 00:38.622
I heard Zoe.
Oh, my god.

00:38.630 --> 00:40.518
Audrey:
She must he
at wren lake somewhere.

00:40.530 --> 00:42.498
Audrey: The dock!
Emma: Yes!

00:42.500 --> 00:44.365
(Grunting)

00:44.370 --> 00:46.793
We played your game
and we fol/owed your ru/es...
Zoe?

00:46.810 --> 00:49.301
And you still killed Zoe.
[always win.

00:49.310 --> 00:52.199
You're gonna lose in the end.
Real/y? Look at the evidence.

00:52.210 --> 00:56.271
You hired Jake
to burn down your stupid
failed development.

00:56.280 --> 00:57.941
You got him to do
your dirty work.

00:57.950 --> 00:59.918
He would still be alive
if it wasn't for you.

00:59.920 --> 01:03.686
It's my mom's
special place.
For special friends?

01:03.690 --> 01:05.487
Miguel:
Sta yo didn ’t
come home last night

01:05.490 --> 01:07.321
We came to lakewood
for a fresh start,

01:07.330 --> 01:09.150
butthen,
i found these in his room.

01:09.160 --> 01:12.652
I found a bunch
of old pictures of myself

01:12.670 --> 01:14.524
at _a farm
out on pIkeVIew road.

01:14.530 --> 01:17.533
Miguel:
I went back to the p/g farm.
There’s a hidden room.

01:17.540 --> 01:19.496
I found furniture,
photos of Emma.

01:19.510 --> 01:21.603
I think Brandon James
might be back.

01:21.610 --> 01:24.408
I think I may have a way
to tell if he's really back.

01:24.410 --> 01:28.369
How?
Its a long shot.

01:36.060 --> 01:39.382
(Suspenseful music playing)

01:46.730 --> 01:51.235
(Clock ticking)

01:53.510 --> 01:55.159
(Alarm beeps)

02:35.520 --> 02:39.775
(Metal scraping)

03:43.650 --> 03:47.848
(Clattering,
pages turning)

03:47.850 --> 03:51.854
(Breathing heavily)

03:54.360 --> 03:55.850
(Gasps)

04:01.470 --> 04:03.324
(Banging)

04:03.970 --> 04:05.995
(Door opens)

04:07.140 --> 04:08.732
(Door closes)

04:58.520 --> 05:00.078
(Locks door)

05:00.660 --> 05:02.082
Mom!

05:20.610 --> 05:23.602
What are you doing up?
Couldn't sleep.

05:23.620 --> 05:26.271
You going somewhere?
It's, like, 3:30.

05:26.290 --> 05:27.609
(Keys jingling)

05:27.620 --> 05:29.747
Emma's.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.085
(Door closes)

05:33.090 --> 05:35.479
(Car door opens,
engine starts)

05:36.560 --> 05:39.051
(Vehicle departs)

05:39.070 --> 05:40.196
(Police radio chatter)

05:40.200 --> 05:43.658
The house is all clear.
We checked it top to bottom.

05:43.670 --> 05:46.195
This wooden heart
the only thing left behind?

05:46.210 --> 05:48.132
I think so.

05:48.140 --> 05:49.767
Kieran!

05:51.510 --> 05:54.172
He didn't hurt you,
did he?

05:54.180 --> 05:55.408
No.

06:09.530 --> 06:14.126
I tried communicating
with Brandon earlier tonight,
like we talked about.

06:14.130 --> 06:16.394
Honestly, I didn't think
anything would come of it.

06:16.400 --> 06:17.958
This is a response?

06:17.970 --> 06:20.495
I don't know.
I'm terrified.

06:20.510 --> 06:25.231
It's okay. It's okay.
We'll figure this out.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.968
Let's say
that it's not Brandon.

06:28.980 --> 06:30.299
Let's say it's not Brandon.

06:30.320 --> 06:35.189
Is there anyone else who has
a strong connection to Piper?

06:37.520 --> 06:38.817
Kristin lang knew Piper.

06:38.830 --> 06:42.254
Quinn:
Shen'ﬁ‘acosta and I
are doing everything poss/h/e

06:42.260 --> 06:45.798
to make sure that we apprehend
the person respons/b/e

06:45.800 --> 06:47.563
for these heinous cr/mes.

06:47.570 --> 06:49.526
We did not deserve
P/per Shaw,

06:49.540 --> 06:53.499
and we do not deserve
these new horrors.

06:53.510 --> 06:54.499
Hey!

06:54.510 --> 06:57.536
Hey. Hey, guys.

06:57.540 --> 07:00.008
How you doing?

07:00.810 --> 07:02.402
I, um...
I got you a coffee,

07:02.420 --> 07:06.572
and I got you a mocha,
coconut, extra shot, right?

07:06.590 --> 07:08.546
I can only have
clear fluids.

07:08.550 --> 07:09.778
Right. Right. Sorry.

07:09.790 --> 07:13.180
Um, we, uh... we downloaded
a bunch of movies to watch.

07:13.190 --> 07:14.418
All your creepy faves!

07:14.430 --> 07:17.490
Psycho, night
of the living dead;
it follows.

07:17.500 --> 07:20.025
I don't want
to watch any of that.

07:23.800 --> 07:27.907
Zoe said it. I turn death
into a puzzle I can solve

07:27.910 --> 07:30.708
instead of dealing
with my feelings.

07:30.710 --> 07:32.905
I missed out on so much...

07:32.910 --> 07:37.301
Obsessing on slasher logic,
playing detective.

07:37.320 --> 07:38.639
I'm done with all of that.

07:38.650 --> 07:39.810
What do you mean?

07:39.820 --> 07:41.481
I'm done with _
my murder obsessmn

07:41.490 --> 07:43.708
and everything
that goes with it.

07:43.720 --> 07:45.210
I'm shutting down
the morgue.

07:45.220 --> 07:46.482
We can't give up, Noah.

07:46.490 --> 07:49.653
Why not?
He wins every game.

07:49.660 --> 07:52.720
I told my mom you guys
would go over and take
down the murderboard

07:52.730 --> 07:55.893
and pack up everything
that goes with it.

07:57.570 --> 08:01.438
I don't want to see any
of that stuff ever again.

08:02.180 --> 08:06.605
Yeah. Of course, Noah.
Whatever you need.

08:18.830 --> 08:21.355
(Clattering, beeping)

08:24.660 --> 08:26.753
Welcome home!
Hm, home, huh?

08:26.770 --> 08:29.591
Yeah! I say
we stay here forever.

08:29.600 --> 08:32.364
Mm, I say you're crazy.

08:34.270 --> 08:36.659
How's Noah?
Mm, he's ruined.

08:36.680 --> 08:38.409
He's not acting
like himself at all.

08:38.410 --> 08:43.143
Sad part is,
we all know exactly
what he's going through.

08:45.550 --> 08:49.145
Oh, someone's good
at room service.

08:49.690 --> 08:52.614
You have some options
for lunch.

08:54.860 --> 08:58.694
They've been running
that press conference
all morning.

08:58.700 --> 09:01.362
Should I turn it off?
No.

09:02.030 --> 09:07.832
We have survived
this kind of rampage before
and we wﬂl survive it again,

09:07.840 --> 09:13.301
by keeping
our loved ones close,
home, where they belong,

09:13.310 --> 09:17.349
with their fam/lies,
safe and sound.

09:17.350 --> 09:18.840
He was talking
to you, wasn't he?

09:18.850 --> 09:22.980
Lakewood has
a dark past but...

09:23.560 --> 09:27.656
I don't know how we're gonna
decipher this without Noah.

09:33.400 --> 09:38.463
Audrey, is there anything
that you haven't told me
about Piper?

09:38.470 --> 09:39.630
No. No, no.

09:39.640 --> 09:44.407
I promise, you know
the whole horrible,
embarrassing story.

10:22.950 --> 10:26.317
Guys? Hey, hey.
Come here. Look at this.

10:26.320 --> 10:30.040
Will's funeral.
No, look in the background.

10:30.060 --> 10:33.985
Oh, my god. That's Eli.
Eli was in lakewood?

10:33.990 --> 10:37.118
Did you know this?
No.

10:37.630 --> 10:41.259
What was Eli doing
at will's funeral?

10:49.140 --> 10:52.439
Inpatient faality,
ma/ 2546.
Hey.

10:52.450 --> 10:54.748
Did you get
the murderboard down?

10:54.750 --> 10:56.638
It and everything else.

10:56.650 --> 10:58.948
All boxed up
and awaiting your orders.

10:58.950 --> 11:01.487
Good. Incinerate it.

11:02.460 --> 11:05.020
We found something
in the teardown.
Audrey, I'm done.

11:05.020 --> 11:06.885
It's a lead
in your accomplice theory.

11:06.890 --> 11:08.585
I told you, I don't care.

11:08.590 --> 11:10.319
No more murder stuff.

11:10.330 --> 11:14.027
Okay. You're right.
I'm sorry.

11:14.470 --> 11:17.633
Is that why you're here?
No, actually.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.449
I went through this too,
with Rachel.

11:32.450 --> 11:34.611
If you want to talk...

11:38.720 --> 11:41.723
Zoe spoke my language.

11:41.730 --> 11:45.598
Told me the morgue
was amazing.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.797
That I could make
the morbid beautiful.

11:50.940 --> 11:52.737
(Phone vibrating)

11:58.340 --> 11:59.739
(Phone vibrates)

12:04.820 --> 12:07.516
I think I'm gonna do
one final podcast.

12:07.520 --> 12:11.559
A tribute to Zoe,
to say good-bye.

12:12.890 --> 12:15.085
I'll let you get to it.

12:22.030 --> 12:24.999
Emma: "She's good
at cutting people off.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.901
She better watch out.
I cut deeper."

12:27.910 --> 12:29.138
Wh-what's he saying?

12:29.140 --> 12:31.472
How have you
cut anyone off?

12:32.350 --> 12:34.568
Oh, my god, this...
(Sighs)

12:34.580 --> 12:36.969
Oh, my god,
this could be Eli.

12:36.980 --> 12:40.370
He sent me a bunch of texts
after what happened
at the carnival.

12:40.390 --> 12:43.041
I didn't respond because
i had no idea what to say.

12:43.060 --> 12:46.518
Could he think you're
maybe cutting him off?

12:46.530 --> 12:49.624
Yeah, maybe.
I gotta take care this.

12:49.630 --> 12:52.497
Hey, Kieran! Kieran, stop!
I have to confront him, Emma.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.559
This has to stop.
No, seriously,
she's right! don't go!

12:54.570 --> 12:57.698
I'm gonna bash his head in.
If Eli is the one
who's actually behind all this

12:57.700 --> 13:00.669
and you go and confront him,
who knows what he's gonna do?

13:00.670 --> 13:06.131
Okay? Please. Hey.
For me, don't do it.

13:06.910 --> 13:09.276
Okay. No, you're right.

13:13.620 --> 13:16.487
So, what are we gonna do?

13:21.560 --> 13:22.686
(Objects rustling)

13:22.700 --> 13:24.952
He's paying us $15,000
to get out of town.

13:24.960 --> 13:29.863
Why does this always happen?
You make some dumb mistake
and ruin everything.

13:29.870 --> 13:32.691
Mistake?
No, this is payday.

13:35.670 --> 13:37.467
And what have i
ruined for you?

13:37.480 --> 13:41.200
I have things here, okay?
Things that I don't want
to run away from.

13:41.210 --> 13:44.418
And by "things," you mean
your cousin's girlfriend?

13:45.150 --> 13:46.708
Don't you understand
that if we stay,

13:46.720 --> 13:49.644
we risk them finding out
everything about us?

13:49.660 --> 13:51.082
Yeah, no, we gotta go.

13:51.090 --> 13:54.526
No, we don't! Okay?

13:54.530 --> 13:57.852
We're not going anywhere
until I say so.

13:59.830 --> 14:02.867
What about the mayor?
Screw the mayor.

14:02.870 --> 14:04.735
I'll get rid of that.

14:04.740 --> 14:05.889
Hey, it’s Brooke.

14:05.910 --> 14:07.662
Leave a message
if you have to,

14:07.670 --> 14:09.137
but I ’0’ really
rather you text.

14:09.140 --> 14:12.109
(Line beeps)
Brooke, honey,
I'm worried.

14:12.110 --> 14:16.649
I know you're angry,
but it is time to come home,
where it's safe.

14:16.650 --> 14:19.414
Honey, i...
(Loud music playing inside)

14:19.420 --> 14:21.809
Woman:
if you want me,
I ’ll be waiting

14:21.820 --> 14:24.516
if you don ’1; its okay

14:24.520 --> 14:26.715
(music grows louder)

14:26.730 --> 14:28.925
Why did you
come here today?

14:28.930 --> 14:30.227
Brooke, is that you?

14:30.230 --> 14:34.428
Do you really think theres
something more to say?

14:34.430 --> 14:36.864
or do you just
need saving?

14:36.870 --> 14:39.759
Brooke! Turn that down!

14:39.770 --> 14:43.069
At your Beck and call

14:43.080 --> 14:45.469
we ’re not
the first to fall

14:45.480 --> 14:46.276
Brooke?

14:46.280 --> 14:48.373
To feel unknown

14:48.380 --> 14:49.176
Brooke?

14:49.180 --> 14:53.970
St/l/ we jump
at your Beck and call

14:53.990 --> 14:57.141
we ’re not
the first to fall

14:57.160 --> 15:00.789
to feel unknown

15:00.790 --> 15:04.248
to feel unknown

15:04.260 --> 15:08.128
to feel unknown

15:08.130 --> 15:09.995
to feel un...

15:10.800 --> 15:12.734
(faint clattering)

15:47.870 --> 15:50.202
I know you're
having a hard time
remembering things,

15:50.210 --> 15:52.576
but our investigation
into the incident
at the children's home

15:52.580 --> 15:55.640
revealed that you
and Piper Shaw
were residents.

15:55.650 --> 15:58.278
Is that right?
Oh.

15:58.280 --> 16:02.239
Well, yes,
i was at blessed sisters
for a very short while.

16:02.250 --> 16:04.514
But you and Piper
were close?
No.

16:04.520 --> 16:07.455
I barely knew her.
Piper was a lot
younger than me.

16:07.460 --> 16:10.179
Well, how long were
you both in the home?

16:10.200 --> 16:12.760
Three or four months,
if that.

16:12.770 --> 16:14.453
You were kids
under the same roof.

16:14.470 --> 16:15.767
I'm sure
you played together.

16:15.770 --> 16:19.069
A lot of kids passed
through that place, sheriff.

16:19.070 --> 16:22.506
If Piper and I ever
did anything together,
i don't remember it.

16:22.510 --> 16:25.104
And, honestly, the fact that
i have any connection to her

16:25.110 --> 16:26.737
is not something I'm eager
to admit to this town.

16:26.750 --> 16:31.039
Or to the other students that
you taped wrthout permnssron?

16:33.520 --> 16:34.817
I'm doing
an informal case study

16:34.820 --> 16:37.584
on the survivors
of last year's attacks.

16:37.590 --> 16:39.387
If they knew I had
any link to Piper,

16:39.390 --> 16:41.358
they never
would've talked to me.

16:43.130 --> 16:44.358
Hmm...

16:44.360 --> 16:47.329
Well, in your research...

16:47.330 --> 16:48.797
Is there anyone
that you felt had

16:48.800 --> 16:51.496
an unhealthy obsession
with Piper?

16:51.500 --> 16:54.333
Anyone at all?

16:55.670 --> 16:58.503
Your son is very
talented, sheriff,

16:58.510 --> 16:59.807
with a unique perspective.

16:59.810 --> 17:03.644
Is that a nice way
of saying "disturbing"?
Maybe.

17:03.650 --> 17:06.346
But you know what
it stems from, don't you?

17:07.220 --> 17:08.619
He's trying
to understand you.

17:08.620 --> 17:10.247
(Scoffs) He's trying
to understand me?

17:10.260 --> 17:11.852
His early fascination
with death started

17:11.860 --> 17:14.158
when he snuck
into one of your files.

17:14.160 --> 17:15.650
He saw a crime scene photo,

17:15.660 --> 17:17.651
a dead gang member
shot in the head.

17:17.660 --> 17:19.548
Stavo said
it was the first time
he was really struck

17:19.570 --> 17:22.596
with the reality
of what you live with
day in and day out.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.261
Well, he didn't say
anything to me...

17:24.270 --> 17:25.794
Stavo doesn't talk about it.

17:25.800 --> 17:28.030
He draws it.

17:28.870 --> 17:34.103
But, if you really want
to know who has the largest
obsession with Piper...

17:34.110 --> 17:36.874
I would have to say
it's Emma duval.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.542
She was already dealing
with hallucinations,

17:39.550 --> 17:40.517
fits of rage,

17:40.520 --> 17:42.283
violent,
recurring nightmares.

17:42.290 --> 17:47.216
There's no telling how
this new round of violence
could be impacting her.

18:02.570 --> 18:05.698
Coming home doesn't mean
you have to forgive him.

18:05.710 --> 18:08.201
I never do... really.

18:08.210 --> 18:12.340
You're going home too, right?
That's the agreement.

18:14.290 --> 18:15.279
I'll be fine.

18:15.290 --> 18:18.157
That's not an answer
to my question.

18:18.160 --> 18:20.412
It doesn't help
to ignore your dad.

18:20.430 --> 18:23.183
I'm going home.
I promise.

18:30.940 --> 18:33.500
Because, Zoe Vaughn...

18:33.510 --> 18:35.603
You were special...

18:35.610 --> 18:37.339
Especially to me,

18:37.340 --> 18:41.606
especially... special.

18:41.610 --> 18:43.646
This is especially horrible.

18:43.650 --> 18:45.538
Yeah, it is.

18:45.550 --> 18:46.778
What are you doing here?

18:46.790 --> 18:49.213
Heard you were screwed up.

18:52.390 --> 18:55.257
I guess I didn't think of you
as the hospital visit type.

18:55.260 --> 18:58.297
Don't be mad.
I didn't bring flowers.

18:58.300 --> 19:00.222
(Scoffs)
So, what are you
working on?

19:00.230 --> 19:03.199
Just a farewell podcast.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.667
The culmination
of my life's work

19:04.670 --> 19:07.434
that needs to be perfect
because it's also a eulogy

19:07.440 --> 19:11.308
for one of the most amazing
women that's ever lived.

19:11.310 --> 19:12.504
She was amazing.

19:12.510 --> 19:16.742
But you cannot end
the morgue, you dumbass.

19:17.380 --> 19:19.519
Empathy is tough
for you, huh?

19:19.520 --> 19:23.684
Your podcast does
something for people,
me included.

19:23.690 --> 19:26.614
Thanks, but I'm done.
Noah”.

19:26.630 --> 19:29.758
_ The death rate
IS one per person.

19:29.760 --> 19:32.729
Nobody gets
out of this alive.

19:32.730 --> 19:34.721
Someone needs
to talk about that.

19:34.730 --> 19:36.698
Now, I'm sending you
something better

19:36.700 --> 19:40.033
than some crappy
"get well" balloons.

19:41.010 --> 19:43.160
Check your email.

20:08.770 --> 20:10.761
I really hope this works.

20:17.440 --> 20:20.500
Eli: You know
he's completely losing it
right now. He has to be.

20:20.510 --> 20:22.603
All right.
Well, I hope you know
what you're getting into,

20:22.610 --> 20:25.841
'cause I'm not really
_ comfortable...
listen, it's fine, okay?

20:25.850 --> 20:28.785
(Fridge door opens)
Eli: Let's grab a beer.

20:28.790 --> 20:31.588
You're not gonna believe
what I found in those files.

20:31.590 --> 20:33.956
_ It's more than
Just insurance scams.

20:33.960 --> 20:36.451
He's robbed half
the people in town.

20:36.460 --> 20:38.428
He even played
the jameses.

20:38.430 --> 20:39.624
Wait. And who are they?

20:39.630 --> 20:42.667
Lakewood's
most famous family.

20:53.950 --> 20:55.372
(Phone vibrating)

20:55.380 --> 20:56.870
Hey, look.

20:58.620 --> 20:59.848
Did you find anything?

20:59.850 --> 21:01.841
I'm just getting here.

21:39.420 --> 21:41.456
Oh, my god. That’s...

21:42.460 --> 21:43.927
Em ma :
’Pioer Shaw. ”

21:43.930 --> 21:45.522
Yeah.

21:45.530 --> 21:48.294
Yeah, those are
my letters to Piper.

21:59.680 --> 22:00.806
Come on.

22:00.810 --> 22:02.448
Come here, come on.

22:02.450 --> 22:03.872
Check it out.
Oh, my god.

22:03.880 --> 22:06.519
He was using these
to mess with you?
To enslave me.

22:06.520 --> 22:09.910
You realize that if Eli
had these letters...

22:10.320 --> 22:12.208
then he's the killer.
No doubt.

22:12.220 --> 22:14.256
We should probably
turn these over to the police.

22:14.260 --> 22:17.252
No. No, Audrey, you can't
do that. Those are gonna
incriminate you.

22:17.260 --> 22:20.229
We need to find
more evidence against Eli.

22:21.730 --> 22:25.097
What are these?
These aren't mine.

22:26.840 --> 22:30.708
These are just
like the pictures
that I saw at the farm.

22:30.710 --> 22:32.337
These might even
be the same ones.

22:32.340 --> 22:35.343
Could Eli be the person
you saw there?

22:35.350 --> 22:36.601
Yeah, maybe.

22:36.620 --> 22:38.679
Maybe he's using
the pig farm as a hideout.

22:38.680 --> 22:41.240
Who knows how long
he's been in lakewood?

22:41.250 --> 22:42.615
So, Eli's in the house
right now?

22:42.620 --> 22:44.315
He's in the baclqard
with his mom.

22:44.320 --> 22:45.719
You know what?
Take these back.
What?

22:45.720 --> 22:49.224
I'm serious. Take them back!
If he finds out they're missing,

22:49.230 --> 22:50.754
there's no telling
what he'll do, okay?

22:50.760 --> 22:53.820
We cannot piss him off
or let him know
we're onto him.

22:53.830 --> 22:55.320
Take them.
Okay.

22:55.330 --> 22:57.218
Take these, too.

22:57.240 --> 22:58.298
Go.

22:58.300 --> 23:01.565
I'll see you at your house.
Emma: Okay.

23:02.770 --> 23:04.738
You know, there's probably
more evidence at the pig farm.

23:04.740 --> 23:08.744
Yeah. We need to go now
while Eli's in the house.

23:08.750 --> 23:10.547
I'm gonna text Kieran.

23:13.590 --> 23:17.515
(Engine starts,
vehicle departs)

23:38.780 --> 23:39.701
(Sighs)

23:39.710 --> 23:41.507
(Door closes)
Hello.

23:41.510 --> 23:46.573
Brooke. Did, um, you enjoy
your stay at the emissary?

23:46.590 --> 23:51.687
Mm, I did. I'm only home
because I missed my closet.

23:51.690 --> 23:54.557
Did you get my message?
Mm-hmm.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.380
And I saw your speech.

23:56.400 --> 24:01.520
Dad, how many times
do I have to tell you not
to wear that tie? It's ugly.

24:03.670 --> 24:05.228
Brooke...

24:07.470 --> 24:09.358
I missed you.

24:09.780 --> 24:12.578
Good. I'm glad.

24:14.750 --> 24:16.604
(Phone dings)

24:29.800 --> 24:33.657
(Phone dings, vibrates)

24:35.270 --> 24:36.589
(Chuckles)

24:52.280 --> 24:53.679
(Phone dings)

25:13.610 --> 25:15.601
Sheriff?
That the forensics
from the barn?

25:15.610 --> 25:17.965
Preliminary results.
Blood residue matches
Jake Fitzgerald.

25:17.980 --> 25:23.577
Only three sets of prints.
Fitzgerald, Audrey Jensen,
and Emma duval.

25:23.580 --> 25:25.969
Well, we know
that they were there.
Anything else?

25:25.980 --> 25:28.619
Uh, no. No, sir.
(Sighs)

25:28.620 --> 25:32.351
How does somebody bury
a guy alive and not leave
any fingerprints?

25:32.360 --> 25:36.558
I don't know. I've never
buried anyone alive.

25:40.600 --> 25:44.889
And one last thank you
to my loyal listeners
for your condolences.

25:44.900 --> 25:50.008
Life is short. It is random.
I ’ve seen
ﬁnal dest/nation.

25:50.010 --> 25:52.729
Death is coming for us all
and it can't be cheated.

25:52.740 --> 25:56.744
It's up to us
to enjoy every moment
we're luclq enough to have,

25:56.750 --> 26:01.346
with the people
we're luclq enough to love.

26:09.560 --> 26:14.429
You know, tonight was going
to be my final broadcast...

26:14.430 --> 26:17.968
But Zoe loved this show,
just like you guys.

26:17.970 --> 26:22.168
She wouldn't have let me
shut it down, or give up.

26:22.170 --> 26:23.967
So, tonight's not
the end, my friends.

26:23.980 --> 26:28.076
Instead ton/ght we remember
that its okay to be afraid.

26:28.080 --> 26:30.878
The only ones
who aren ’t afraid
are the monsters.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.939
Somebody wh/spered that
to me in a dream once,

26:32.950 --> 26:37.683
and reminded me that,
no matter how many n/ghtmares
Freddy sends us,

26:37.690 --> 26:40.215
we, the living,
have to wake up

26:40.230 --> 26:43.358
and rise up
against the monsters.

26:43.360 --> 26:45.658
I'm dedicating
this installment
of the morgue

26:45.660 --> 26:47.628
and everyone that follows

26:47.630 --> 26:49.518
to Zoe Vaughn.

26:50.200 --> 26:54.933
Every time I press upload,
I'll be thinking of you.

26:56.110 --> 26:57.839
Rest in peace.

26:59.680 --> 27:03.798
All right, Zoe, let's see
if you're listening.

27:07.120 --> 27:11.284
(Distorted laughing)
What the heck?

27:12.590 --> 27:14.148
What is this?

27:14.160 --> 27:17.357
Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop.

27:17.360 --> 27:18.793
Stop...

27:18.800 --> 27:22.099
Oh. Oh, okay.
So, somebody remotely
hacked your laptop

27:22.100 --> 27:23.829
and uploaded
a mystery file.

27:23.840 --> 27:28.937
It's probably nothing.
Just a superfan
continuing the narrative.

27:32.780 --> 27:37.444
(Sighs)
It's just a superfan.
It's just a superfan.

27:39.120 --> 27:42.339
(Woman screaming)

27:44.690 --> 27:47.250
(Computer dings)

27:56.200 --> 27:58.521
Sheriff!
What is it?

27:58.540 --> 28:00.565
You gotta see this.

28:00.570 --> 28:03.437
(Haunting melody playing)

28:08.180 --> 28:09.977
Audrey:
I brought Piper
to lakewood.

28:09.980 --> 28:12.869
I would do anything
to keep it secret.

28:12.880 --> 28:16.680
Help me! Please!
Somebody helo! Helo!

28:16.690 --> 28:18.214
Emma:
I stabbed all of my friends.

28:18.220 --> 28:20.017
(Echoing)
All of my friends.

28:20.030 --> 28:21.918
I look down and my hands
are covered in blood.

28:21.930 --> 28:23.750
(Echoing)
Covered in blood.

28:23.760 --> 28:27.890
It all closes in on you,
and then you can ’t get out.

28:27.900 --> 28:30.994
(Screaming)

28:31.000 --> 28:32.661
Emma:
I trusted her...
Audrey?

28:32.670 --> 28:35.059
What made me think I could even
set foot in this place again?

28:35.070 --> 28:39.530
Audrey:
He was l/ke me.
He was alone, rejected
and angry.

28:40.050 --> 28:44.646
This Is Audrey.
Can ’t get to my phone.
Leave a message.

28:48.650 --> 28:50.948
This playing from
that Noah kid's podcast?

28:50.960 --> 28:53.884
Yes, sir.
It started streaming
in a repeating loop.

28:53.890 --> 28:55.255
People have been
calling us about it.

28:55.260 --> 28:56.921
Emma:
No matter where I ran,

28:56.930 --> 28:58.522
they followed me.

28:58.530 --> 28:59.758
Their voices...

28:59.760 --> 29:01.250
Get this down
to digital forensics.

29:03.030 --> 29:04.327
of who posted this.

29:04.340 --> 29:06.865
Friends taunting me,
taunting me. . .
Miguel!

29:06.870 --> 29:09.759
Uan I cou/dn ’t take it
anymore and I lashed out.

29:09.770 --> 29:11.067
_Kieran wilcox
just called me.

29:11.080 --> 29:13.332
Emma and Audrey
are on their way
to the James farm.

29:13.350 --> 29:14.931
The pig farm?
Did Kieran say why?

29:14.950 --> 29:17.043
No, and Emma won't
answer my calls.

29:17.050 --> 29:18.870
Stevens, let's move.

29:31.830 --> 29:35.152
Fabulous.
It's a crumbling,
creepy house.

29:35.170 --> 29:38.867
Yeah, there's also
a crumbling, creepy barn
to match.

29:40.710 --> 29:44.828
It used to belong
to the James family.
Or it still does.

29:44.840 --> 29:48.571
Really?
How did I not know that?

29:51.020 --> 29:55.912
Okay, so I'm thinking
that I go inside
and you stay out here?

29:55.920 --> 29:57.547
Look, someone has
to keep watch,

29:57.560 --> 29:59.619
and I've already been
in there before.

29:59.620 --> 30:01.110
Okay?

30:01.130 --> 30:02.119
Yeah, okay.

30:02.130 --> 30:05.395
Just call me the minute
that you see anything.

30:16.070 --> 30:17.867
(Sighs)

30:32.120 --> 30:34.987
(Floor creaking)

32:01.650 --> 32:03.777
(Ringtone playing)

32:03.780 --> 32:06.874
What's happening?
I thinkI found something.

32:06.890 --> 32:08.539
Come upstairs.

32:51.400 --> 32:54.255
Look. Look, someone's been
living here, or hiding out
here, or something.

32:54.270 --> 32:58.627
This is just like what I saw
when I came here with Brooke
that first time.

32:58.640 --> 33:00.494
This is creepy.

33:01.910 --> 33:03.730
What's that?

33:04.610 --> 33:06.771
Whoa, whoa. That's mine.
That's my dream journal.

33:06.780 --> 33:11.001
"I stabbed all of my friends.
Wildly. Out of control.

33:11.020 --> 33:13.716
Noah, Kieran, Audrey.

33:14.120 --> 33:15.883
I look down and my hands
are covered in blood.

33:15.890 --> 33:18.381
I've had a lot of dreams
that end with blood
on my hands lately.

33:18.390 --> 33:21.382
My mom heard me
screaming in my sleep."

33:22.860 --> 33:27.126
Wait, the...
The killer must've taken this
out of my room last night,

33:27.130 --> 33:29.018
and then brought it here.

33:29.030 --> 33:30.759
Why is it open
to this page?

33:30.770 --> 33:33.898
(Vehicle approaching)
Hey.

33:38.840 --> 33:42.708
Isn't that
Brooke's dad's car?
Let's go.

34:04.270 --> 34:09.435
Okay, I'm here!
Let's make this quick.

34:12.510 --> 34:16.606
Come on! I haven't got
all night, old MacDonald!

34:23.720 --> 34:25.813
(Sighs)

34:29.130 --> 34:30.688
(Whistling)

35:04.960 --> 35:06.552
(Whistling)

35:18.740 --> 35:20.105
(Whistling)

35:37.160 --> 35:38.718
(Whistling)

35:54.210 --> 35:55.939
(Phone dings)

36:03.390 --> 36:04.914
(Groans)

36:04.920 --> 36:09.857
(Grunting, screaming)

36:21.540 --> 36:23.030
Wait.

36:23.940 --> 36:26.636
We have to find out
what he's doing here.

36:32.180 --> 36:33.408
It is so weird.

36:33.420 --> 36:35.172
I've had nightmares
about this place

36:35.190 --> 36:37.249
since I was a little kid.

36:38.890 --> 36:40.778
Ready?
Yeah.

36:43.060 --> 36:45.949
Oh, my god!
Mr. Maddox!

36:45.960 --> 36:48.099
(Groaning)

36:50.540 --> 36:53.862
Oh!
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god!

36:54.470 --> 36:57.030
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no!

36:57.980 --> 37:00.904
(Loud clattering)

37:19.300 --> 37:21.928
(Siren blaring faintly)

37:24.270 --> 37:27.137
(Sirens blaring)

37:27.140 --> 37:29.734
(Vehicle doors closing)

37:29.740 --> 37:33.176
Drop the weapons!
Hands up!

37:38.620 --> 37:41.214
(Suspenseful music playing)

37:45.820 --> 37:49.688
Man: Coming through.
(Woman speaking indistinctly)

37:50.290 --> 37:52.053
Audrey:
Wait, are you arresting us?

37:52.060 --> 37:54.290
Emma: You can't possibly
believe that we did this.

37:54.300 --> 37:56.029
The killer was in the barn!
We heard him!

37:56.030 --> 37:58.123
Sheriff, you're letting him
get away! It wasn't us!

37:58.140 --> 38:00.768
You know that it wasn't us!
All right, I need you
to search the grounds,

38:00.770 --> 38:03.603
a hundred yards
in every direction...
Emma! Emma!

38:03.610 --> 38:06.170
Miguel: Let's go.
Mom, the mayor is dead.
We didn't do it.

38:06.180 --> 38:08.205
_ We didn't do it!
Wait, you're arresting her?

38:08.210 --> 38:11.998
Maggie, we found her
with a pitchfork in her hand
over a dead body.

38:12.020 --> 38:14.318
(Groans)
I have to take her in.

38:14.320 --> 38:16.208
Let me talk to her.
You can't talk to her here.

38:16.220 --> 38:18.688
You shouldn't even be here.
I'm the reason you're here!

38:18.690 --> 38:20.658
You can talk to her
at the station.

38:20.660 --> 38:23.128
Maggie, as a friend...

38:23.130 --> 38:25.849
Emma needs a lawyer.

38:26.400 --> 38:30.894
It's gonna be okay.
Just go quietly. I'm gonna
see you at the station.

38:30.900 --> 38:34.165
Yeah, okay.
Emma! Emma!

38:34.170 --> 38:36.104
Kieran! Kieran!
Whoa! Stop, stop, stop!

38:36.110 --> 38:37.862
Let them go!
Don't make this worse.

38:37.880 --> 38:41.134
Don't make it worse!
You've got this wrong.
So wrong!

38:41.150 --> 38:42.742
Emma!
Stop.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.042
Stop.
Emma!

38:45.050 --> 38:46.312
(Engine starts)

38:46.320 --> 38:50.040
(Siren blaring)

38:57.060 --> 38:59.858
(Both breathing heavily)

38:59.860 --> 39:01.828
If they think
we killed the mayor...

39:01.830 --> 39:04.958
then they think
we killed everybody.
