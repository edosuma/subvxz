WEBVTT

00:11.968 --> 00:13.448
Weren't we here before?

00:13.622 --> 00:15.798
I mean, doesn't that mattress
look strangely familiar?

00:15.972 --> 00:17.887
It's probably because
we saw one just like it

00:18.061 --> 00:21.456
in the last alley and
the 150 before that.

00:21.630 --> 00:23.545
They all start to look
the same after a while.

00:23.719 --> 00:25.677
Now, where is this
paragon of good

00:25.851 --> 00:27.157
we're supposed to protect?

00:27.331 --> 00:29.246
Hey. Slow down.

00:29.420 --> 00:30.987
We've got
to be careful, okay?

00:31.161 --> 00:32.815
Okay, I just need to get
home before Leo is sentenced.

00:32.989 --> 00:34.425
Don't worry.

00:34.599 --> 00:35.557
When the Elders hand down
their punishment,

00:35.731 --> 00:37.385
you're going to know.

00:37.559 --> 00:38.908
Well, this waiting business
sucks.

00:39.082 --> 00:40.779
I mean, Leo was an Avatar
for less time

00:40.953 --> 00:42.825
than it's taking them
to make up their minds.

00:42.999 --> 00:43.913
Hey.

00:44.087 --> 00:45.132
It's going to be okay.

00:45.306 --> 00:46.959
You're not going
to lose Leo again.

00:47.134 --> 00:48.439
The Elders still need him.

00:48.613 --> 00:49.397
They're not going
to do anything rash.

00:49.571 --> 00:51.051
Besides,

00:51.225 --> 00:52.748
it's Phoebe we should be
worrying about.

00:52.922 --> 00:54.445
Her man's disappearing tonight.

00:54.619 --> 00:56.273
Her what?

00:56.447 --> 00:58.275
She didn't tell me
she had a thing for Drake.Well,

00:58.449 --> 00:59.798
I mean,
she didn't tell me either,

00:59.972 --> 01:02.149
but come on, he's cute,
he's funny, he's smart,

01:02.323 --> 01:03.628
and he's destined to leave.

01:03.802 --> 01:04.847
I don't know, that kind of
sounds like her type

01:05.021 --> 01:06.544
to a tee.
I mean,

01:06.718 --> 01:07.893
really, how many times does
a girl have to get hurt

01:08.068 --> 01:09.286
before she just kind of,
like, wakes up?

01:09.460 --> 01:13.334
So you think she's...
the innocent.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.031
No, I don't think
she's the innocent.

01:15.205 --> 01:16.902
I think she definitely
has a part of this.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.208
I think she absolutely...

01:18.382 --> 01:19.644
Behind you,
the innocent.

01:19.818 --> 01:21.081
Hey, if you women
need a hot meal

01:21.255 --> 01:22.386
and a place to crash,
there's a...

01:22.560 --> 01:23.779
PAIGE:
Okay, hi.

01:23.953 --> 01:25.041
I'm wearing lip gloss.
Do I look homeless?

01:26.216 --> 01:27.348
For God's sakes.

01:30.699 --> 01:34.920
I think Phoebe's just been
unlucky in love lately.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.270
Do ya think?

01:36.444 --> 01:37.706
Hey!

01:42.014 --> 01:44.582
Uh, ugly metal thing!

01:53.287 --> 01:54.418
PIPER:
Ah.

01:54.592 --> 01:56.638
Uh...

01:56.812 --> 02:00.642
did we know that
the female spits thorns?

02:02.774 --> 02:04.733
Okay, we really need to
have Leo look at this.

02:04.907 --> 02:06.648
It's fine, really.

02:06.822 --> 02:07.997
Leo!

02:11.218 --> 02:12.262
Why are you
wearing those?

02:12.436 --> 02:15.135
The Elders made their decision.

02:15.309 --> 02:16.223
I have to go.

02:16.397 --> 02:17.572
Right now?

02:17.746 --> 02:19.487
You can't go right now.

02:19.661 --> 02:21.315
The boys are in school,
you won't be able to say...Honey,

02:21.489 --> 02:23.055
this isn't good-bye, okay?

02:23.230 --> 02:24.666
I'm just going up there to
find out what my punishment is.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.189
What do you mean "just"?

02:26.363 --> 02:27.190
You make it sound
like it's no big deal.

02:27.364 --> 02:28.322
What if it's bad?

02:28.496 --> 02:30.672
Well, then
we'll deal with it.

02:30.846 --> 02:32.543
Come on, you're the one
who said the Elders

02:32.717 --> 02:34.458
couldn't yank me away,
remember?
Well,

02:34.632 --> 02:36.547
that was before I had all this
time to stress out about it.

02:36.721 --> 02:38.070
Well, at least now
we're finally going to know.

02:38.245 --> 02:39.637
And that's a good thing,
right?

02:39.811 --> 02:41.813
I mean, the waiting's
been killing us.

02:41.987 --> 02:44.860
Yeah, I know, it's just...

02:45.034 --> 02:46.340
I have a bad feeling.

02:46.514 --> 02:48.124
Me, too.

02:49.691 --> 02:51.432
But we've been through worse.

02:53.782 --> 02:54.783
We just have
to have faith.

02:54.957 --> 02:57.307
Okay?

02:57.481 --> 02:59.091
[they kiss]

03:00.092 --> 03:01.093
I love you.

03:01.268 --> 03:03.008
I love you, too.

03:04.619 --> 03:06.186

SANDRA:
Unfortunately,
the council has been unable

04:13.601 --> 04:15.603
to decide your fate, Leo.

04:15.777 --> 04:17.866
So, that's good, right?

04:18.040 --> 04:19.084
I'm not going
to be punished?

04:19.259 --> 04:20.260
We didn't say that.

04:20.434 --> 04:21.870
We understand

04:22.044 --> 04:24.612
and we fully accept
how being betrayed by an Elder,

04:24.786 --> 04:26.614
by Gideon,
led you to the Avatars.

04:26.788 --> 04:28.790
Still, that doesn't
excuse your betraying us.

04:28.964 --> 04:30.922
The council has
come to realize

04:31.096 --> 04:32.620
that the central problem
is your effort

04:32.794 --> 04:34.491
to balance two distinctly
different worlds,

04:34.665 --> 04:36.537
yours with us
and yours with Piper.

04:36.711 --> 04:39.279
So the only solution is
to find out which world

04:39.453 --> 04:40.976
you truly belong in,
once and for all.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.064
How?

04:42.238 --> 04:43.674
A test, if you will.

04:43.848 --> 04:45.154
You'll be made mortal,

04:45.328 --> 04:46.590
stripped of your powers
and your memories,

04:46.764 --> 04:48.070
and then you'll be relocated.

04:48.244 --> 04:50.594
If the love you share
for Piper

04:50.768 --> 04:53.597
is so strong that you're drawn
back to her despite all odds,

04:53.771 --> 04:55.251
then you will live
with her forever.

04:55.425 --> 04:56.948
To live fully
as a human

04:57.122 --> 04:58.950
without any further interference
from us, ever again.

04:59.124 --> 05:01.605
[scoffs]
But what if I never find her,
then what?

05:01.779 --> 05:03.781
Then, it means that
your destiny is with us,

05:03.955 --> 05:05.479
and we will welcome you,

05:05.653 --> 05:07.002
although you'll never see
your family again.

05:07.176 --> 05:08.220
Are you out of your mind?

05:08.395 --> 05:09.265
I won't do that.

05:09.439 --> 05:10.571
You have no choice.

05:10.745 --> 05:11.789
You have to know,
Leo, this is not

05:11.963 --> 05:13.574
about punishing you.

05:13.748 --> 05:15.750
This is about helping you
to find your way.

05:15.924 --> 05:17.621
Okay,
but if I end up with Piper,

05:17.795 --> 05:19.623
how do I know you won't
eventually butt in again?

05:19.797 --> 05:22.147
Or if I wind up with you
as an Elder,

05:22.322 --> 05:25.542
how do you know I'm not going to
leave, by falling from grace?

05:25.716 --> 05:28.458
No Elder has ever done that
before.

05:28.632 --> 05:30.417
You take away my family
and I will.

05:30.591 --> 05:31.940
We are not taking away

05:32.114 --> 05:33.245
anything from you, Leo.

05:33.420 --> 05:34.725
This is about you making
a choice.

05:34.899 --> 05:36.118
Not us.

05:36.292 --> 05:38.294
Don't you see? This
is the only way.

05:38.468 --> 05:40.252
Your heart will guide you
to your true destiny,

05:40.427 --> 05:42.603
be it love
or the greater good.

05:42.777 --> 05:44.300
Whatever way
it turns out,

05:44.474 --> 05:45.736
we will honor it.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.216
As you also must.

05:47.390 --> 05:50.132
Fine, I'll do it.

05:50.306 --> 05:51.786
But first,
I'm gonna say bye to Piper.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.657
It doesn't work that way.

05:53.831 --> 05:57.269
Look, I said I'd take
your damn test.

05:57.444 --> 05:58.836
I'm going to say good-bye
to my family.

05:59.010 --> 06:00.185
No.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.273
The test begins

06:01.448 --> 06:03.624
now!

06:22.773 --> 06:24.775
[horn honking]

06:33.654 --> 06:34.829
[groaning]

06:35.003 --> 06:36.483
Come on, we got
to get you out of here.

06:36.657 --> 06:39.964
[grunting and groaning]

06:47.058 --> 06:49.452
[coughs]

06:50.801 --> 06:53.369
Aah.

06:58.896 --> 07:00.115
[yelling indistinctly]

07:00.289 --> 07:01.290
Go, go, go, go!

07:08.689 --> 07:10.734
Oh, hey...
Boy, what the hell you--

07:10.908 --> 07:11.779
you got any idea
what you're doing?

07:11.953 --> 07:13.781
Bite down.
Huh.

07:13.955 --> 07:14.782
Ugh!

07:14.956 --> 07:15.913
Ugh!
Get in there.

07:16.087 --> 07:17.959
Aah! Aah![arm cracks]

07:20.048 --> 07:22.267
How the hell'd you know
to do that?

07:22.442 --> 07:24.400
[breathing heavily]

07:24.574 --> 07:26.315
[rips jacket]
Oh.

07:26.489 --> 07:27.316
Oh.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.753
[moaning]

07:29.927 --> 07:31.102
Doesn't look too bad.

07:31.276 --> 07:33.017
They should be able
to sew that up.

07:33.191 --> 07:35.106
Finally got lucky for once,
almost running over a doctor.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.459
You are a doctor, right?

07:40.503 --> 07:41.809
I don't know.

07:43.811 --> 07:46.640
PHOEBE:
What do you mean
you don't know?

07:46.814 --> 07:48.468
Leo went to speak
to the Elders this morning,

07:48.642 --> 07:49.947
haven't seen or heard
from him since.

07:50.121 --> 07:51.296
Well, that's just crazy.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.820
We've been to the
Alps and back.

07:52.994 --> 07:54.865
How long does it take
to hand down a sentence?

07:55.039 --> 07:56.998
Well, in defense
of the Elders,

07:57.172 --> 07:59.217
when you live for an eternity,
time does get a little skewed.

07:59.391 --> 08:01.742
Yeah, well, we're human,
so this is torture.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.439
This is ridiculous.

08:03.613 --> 08:04.962
Hey!

08:05.136 --> 08:06.616
Listen, what the hell
did you do to Leo?

08:06.790 --> 08:08.488
PAIGE:
I tried that already,

08:08.662 --> 08:10.359
didn't work so much.Yeah, well,
you know what?

08:10.533 --> 08:12.753
I'm not saving another innocent
till I find out what happened.

08:12.927 --> 08:13.884
You hear me?

08:14.058 --> 08:15.799
I'm not saving
another innocent

08:15.973 --> 08:18.019
till you tell us
what's going on here!

08:18.193 --> 08:19.586
Don't worry.

08:22.153 --> 08:23.764
Leo's fine.

08:23.938 --> 08:25.853
So then, where is he?
Piper,

08:26.027 --> 08:28.943
the Elders came to the consensus
that Leo has lost his way.

08:29.117 --> 08:30.684
So we've sent him

08:30.858 --> 08:33.295
on the path towards
following his destiny.

08:33.469 --> 08:35.515
What? Like the prodigal son out
to find his way in the world?

08:35.689 --> 08:37.038
Uh, you know what?

08:37.212 --> 08:38.518
This Elder speak is
not working for me.

08:38.692 --> 08:39.693
I need some
straight answers.

08:39.867 --> 08:41.651
What exactly did
you do to him?

08:41.825 --> 08:45.394
We erased his memories and put
him back on Earth as a mortal.

08:45.568 --> 08:46.917
Somewhere you'll never find him.

08:47.091 --> 08:48.049
PHOEBE:
What?

08:48.223 --> 08:49.746
He doesn't remember
anything?

08:49.920 --> 08:51.443
He doesn't remember Piper
or his sons? Nothing?

08:51.618 --> 08:53.097
Not even having been an Elder.

08:53.271 --> 08:54.272
That's crazy.

08:54.446 --> 08:55.535
You don't
have the right

08:55.709 --> 08:57.406
to wipe out
someone's mind.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.277
An entire life, my life.

08:59.451 --> 09:01.584
Leo was not just someone, Piper.

09:01.758 --> 09:03.978
He was an Elder,
by his own choice.

09:04.152 --> 09:06.023
He knew all that that entailed.Yeah, he was

09:06.197 --> 09:07.895
also a husband and
a father by choice,

09:08.069 --> 09:10.898
and he would never
abandon his family.

09:11.072 --> 09:12.464
This was not
an easy decision for us.

09:12.639 --> 09:13.901
We love Leo

09:14.075 --> 09:15.163
up there as much
as you do

09:15.337 --> 09:16.991
down here.
He wasn't killed

09:17.165 --> 09:18.340
or recycled.

09:18.514 --> 09:20.037
I hope that you can find
comfort in that.

09:20.211 --> 09:22.823
I'm sorry, you just lobotomized
the love of my life

09:22.997 --> 09:24.651
and you want me
to take comfort in what?

09:24.825 --> 09:26.000
You've got a lot

09:26.174 --> 09:27.436
of nerve, lady.

09:27.610 --> 09:29.046
Now I don't want
to see you again

09:29.220 --> 09:30.744
or any of your
kind ever again.

09:30.918 --> 09:32.746
We're done with
all of you.

09:32.920 --> 09:35.183
Now please, go.

09:35.357 --> 09:37.620
Don't give up hope.

09:37.794 --> 09:38.882
You really need to stop talking.

09:39.056 --> 09:40.449
Now please get out of my house.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.977
That's ridiculous.

09:48.805 --> 09:50.720
Okay, Piper,
I know this seems really bad,

09:50.894 --> 09:52.113
but we can't give up hope.

09:52.287 --> 09:53.854
I mean, Leo is out
there somewhere,

09:54.028 --> 09:57.901
and I'm sure there's lots
of ways we can find him.How?

09:58.075 --> 09:59.773
Uh, I don't know--
we can scry for him,

09:59.947 --> 10:01.035
although he doesn't have
his powers,

10:01.209 --> 10:02.863
so that might be difficult.

10:03.037 --> 10:04.908
We could... I don't know.

10:05.082 --> 10:06.301
I just... I don't know.

10:06.475 --> 10:07.868
This is your idea
of a rah-rah speech?

10:08.042 --> 10:09.173
You're supposed to
be cheering her up,

10:09.347 --> 10:10.392
not pushing her
off the ledge.

10:10.566 --> 10:11.959
Well, you know what,
Paige?

10:12.133 --> 10:14.614
Maybe I'm just
all rah-rah-ed out.

10:14.788 --> 10:16.224
Huh?

10:16.398 --> 10:19.270
Well, maybe it's time
we face the fact that,

10:19.444 --> 10:21.925
you know, perhaps we're
not meant to find love.

10:22.099 --> 10:23.797
PAIGE:
That is ridiculous.

10:23.971 --> 10:25.407
Okay, think about it.

10:25.581 --> 10:26.800
How many Halliwell women
have actually been able

10:26.974 --> 10:28.192
to hold on to their men?

10:29.324 --> 10:32.022
Name one.Okay, uh...

10:34.285 --> 10:35.896
Oh, my God, you're right.
That's so depressing.

10:36.070 --> 10:37.332
Exactly.

10:37.506 --> 10:38.812
We're destined to be spinsters.

10:40.204 --> 10:41.162
All for the greater good.

10:41.336 --> 10:42.511
Might as well be nuns.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.644
With better outfits.

10:44.818 --> 10:45.775
Okay, no, we--

10:45.949 --> 10:46.994
all right, let's 86

10:47.168 --> 10:48.648
that kind of
talk now, people.

10:48.822 --> 10:50.650
We will not give up on love.

10:50.824 --> 10:51.781
Repeat, not give up
on love.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.000
Love is everything.

10:53.174 --> 10:54.523
It's the only thing.

10:54.697 --> 10:55.872
It's why you're here,
it's why I'm here.

10:56.046 --> 10:57.091
Uh, I thought
you were here

10:57.265 --> 10:58.440
to teach at Magic School.

10:58.614 --> 11:00.050
There's that.

11:00.224 --> 11:01.312
But the point is:
you're young, you're hot,

11:01.486 --> 11:02.705
you got magic powers.

11:02.879 --> 11:04.315
Come on,
the whole life's ahead of you.

11:04.489 --> 11:06.970
That's really sweet, and
we appreciate you trying,

11:07.144 --> 11:09.756
but you die tonight at midnight,
and we have to keep fighting.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.671
Yeah, I may be toast,
but love never dies.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.934
You might as well die with me
if you're gonna give up on it.

11:14.108 --> 11:15.413
The point is, Leo

11:15.587 --> 11:16.763
and Piper's love--
it's epic, it's massive.

11:16.937 --> 11:18.286
It's like Romeo
and Juliet,

11:18.460 --> 11:20.418
Anthony and Cleopatra,
Brad and Jennifer.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.812
All tragedies,
I might add.

11:22.986 --> 11:24.422
DRAKE:
Better to have
loved and lost than

11:24.596 --> 11:26.511
yada, yada, yada,
but the point is, it's not lost.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.731
I mean, he's lost,
but he's not lost, you know?

11:28.905 --> 11:30.559
All you got to do is find Leo.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.735
PAIGE:
Well, either way,
if the Elders don't want us

11:32.909 --> 11:34.606
to find him,
we're not gonna be able to.

11:34.781 --> 11:35.956
They didn't
say that.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.697
They're gonna
leave it up to him.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.350
Come on,
precious time

11:39.524 --> 11:40.917
is a-wasting. The longer
you take to look for Leo,

11:41.091 --> 11:42.702
the harder he's
gonna be to find.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.268
Or we can stay here

11:44.442 --> 11:45.748
and feel sorry for ourselves,
if you like.

11:45.922 --> 11:47.228
PIPER:
My husband just

11:47.402 --> 11:49.621
developed a serious case
of amnesia, okay?

11:49.796 --> 11:51.232
Give me a moment.

11:51.406 --> 11:53.756
Phoebe...

11:56.977 --> 12:00.110
If love isn't worth
fighting for, then what is?

12:00.284 --> 12:01.329
PHOEBE [laughs]:
Okay.

12:01.503 --> 12:02.678
So, what are we gonna do?

12:02.852 --> 12:04.245
We'll look
in The Book of Shadows

12:04.419 --> 12:06.290
and see if there's another way
to find Leo.
Amen.

12:06.464 --> 12:07.291
PAIGE:
Okay, I guess I could

12:07.465 --> 12:08.553
check at Magic School.

12:08.728 --> 12:09.685
Now we're talkin'.
Piper,

12:09.859 --> 12:10.991
call Darryl.

12:11.165 --> 12:12.383
Now that Leo's mortal,
he might be able

12:12.557 --> 12:13.558
to track him.DRAKE:
Amen.

12:13.733 --> 12:14.864
Could we go
upstairs?
What?

12:15.038 --> 12:15.735
The-The Book
of Shadows.

12:15.909 --> 12:17.084
Yes.
Let's go.

12:20.304 --> 12:22.263
[slight groan]

12:30.358 --> 12:31.751
Well, that ought to do it.

12:31.925 --> 12:33.927
Once we get you in the system,
we'll be on the road

12:34.101 --> 12:35.406
to finding out
who you really are.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.017
Thanks.

12:37.191 --> 12:39.236
Are you sure you don't
remember anything?

12:39.410 --> 12:40.716
I mean, normally,

12:40.890 --> 12:42.326
a person with amnesia
remembers something.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.764
I wish I did.

12:44.938 --> 12:46.330
Believe me.

12:46.504 --> 12:48.028
Yeah.

12:48.202 --> 12:50.726
Well, at least we know
you're one of the good guys.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.119
Saved old Clyde's life.

12:52.293 --> 12:53.555
[laughs]

12:53.729 --> 12:55.339
You know, son, the
paramedics told me

12:55.513 --> 12:57.646
that the way you fixed up
his leg looked professional.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.083
Instinct, I guess.

13:00.257 --> 13:03.434
Well, it seems to me
that you could be a doctor

13:03.608 --> 13:05.610
or a medic
or something.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.351
Anything
ring a bell?

13:07.525 --> 13:09.527
No, nothing.

13:09.701 --> 13:11.051
Well, okay.

13:11.225 --> 13:12.443
It's okay.

13:12.617 --> 13:13.793
It'll come to you.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.533
Just gonna
take some time.

13:15.707 --> 13:17.666
You see that?

13:17.840 --> 13:20.147
Old Glen's got you on
the database already.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.200
Son, you're bound
to be a bit jumpy.

13:30.374 --> 13:31.593
I'm guessing
you went

13:31.767 --> 13:33.508
through some kind
of hell to get here.

13:33.682 --> 13:34.726
Yeah.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.685
Yeah. Maybe.

13:36.859 --> 13:39.427
Come on, let me take
you over to Nadine's

13:39.601 --> 13:41.168
to get you
something to eat

13:41.342 --> 13:42.734
while we sift
through the computer.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.824
I'd rather stay here.

13:44.998 --> 13:47.478
Well, a man can't think straight
on an empty stomach.

13:47.652 --> 13:49.219
Besides, chances are,

13:49.393 --> 13:52.396
you got some loved ones
out there looking for you,

13:52.570 --> 13:54.442
and once we get the word out,

13:54.616 --> 13:56.487
well, they'll find you
soon enough.

13:56.661 --> 13:58.576
Come on.

13:58.750 --> 13:59.926
[Glen speaking quietly]

14:00.100 --> 14:01.144
We'll never find him.

14:01.318 --> 14:02.624
Not scrying anyway.

14:02.798 --> 14:04.669
And I don't think
we're gonna make it

14:04.844 --> 14:06.976
to the Taj
Mahal by sunset.

14:07.150 --> 14:10.980
I feel terrible about
ruining your last day here.

14:11.154 --> 14:12.982
Hey, don't scry
for me, Argentina.

14:13.156 --> 14:15.071
I'm exactly where I want to be.

14:15.245 --> 14:16.420
In a dingy attic?

14:16.594 --> 14:18.596
Helping those
I'm leaving behind, yeah.

14:18.770 --> 14:21.773
Yeah, see, that's the other
really irritating thing.

14:21.948 --> 14:24.254
You're hell-bent on
helping Piper and Leo,

14:24.428 --> 14:26.430
and yet, you won't
let us help you.

14:26.604 --> 14:27.779
Phoebe, I made a deal.

14:27.954 --> 14:30.086
I got to be human
for a whole year.

14:30.260 --> 14:31.479
My time is up.

14:31.653 --> 14:33.785
I know, but you made
a deal with a demon.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.832
We're the good guys,
the Charmed Ones.

14:37.006 --> 14:38.486
Why won't you let
us help you?

14:38.660 --> 14:41.881
Because I've done all I need
to do to die a happy man.

14:42.055 --> 14:43.099
All except one thing.

14:43.273 --> 14:44.492
See Niagara Falls?

14:44.666 --> 14:47.016
Make sure you don't
give up on love.

14:47.190 --> 14:48.583
Please.

14:48.757 --> 14:50.193
Not that again.

14:50.367 --> 14:53.066
Look, I'm just being
realistic, okay?

14:53.240 --> 14:56.156
I have been heartbroken
so many times by love,

14:56.330 --> 14:57.984
that I'm just
beginning to think

14:58.158 --> 15:00.334
that I'm supposed to
live my life without it.

15:00.508 --> 15:01.857
Well, that is ridiculous.

15:02.031 --> 15:03.076
Nobody is.

15:03.250 --> 15:04.686
I've been demonic without love,

15:04.860 --> 15:06.514
so I know what
I'm talking about.

15:06.688 --> 15:09.430
Love is transcendent,
it's... miraculous.

15:10.866 --> 15:12.607
It's also what can save
Piper and Leo.

15:12.781 --> 15:14.130
Yeah, well, I hope so,

15:14.304 --> 15:16.611
because if it can't,
I'm joining the convent.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.310
Hey.

15:20.484 --> 15:21.485
Hi.

15:21.659 --> 15:22.965
Well, it looks
as if the Elders

15:23.139 --> 15:24.401
have had an original thought
for once,

15:24.575 --> 15:25.315
because there's no precedence
for what

15:25.489 --> 15:26.490
they've done to Leo.

15:26.664 --> 15:27.927
Yeah, we can't find

15:28.101 --> 15:29.406
anything here,
either.Okay.

15:29.580 --> 15:30.886
Well, maybe I should
try scrying for him.

15:31.060 --> 15:32.061
Maybe my whitelighter side

15:32.235 --> 15:34.150
can tap into something
in him.

15:34.324 --> 15:36.022
It would be great
to be able

15:36.196 --> 15:38.938
to tell Piper
something good for once.

15:39.112 --> 15:41.418
PIPER:
Darryl, you have
to do something, anything.

15:41.592 --> 15:44.160
DARRYL:
Look ,Piper,
I'm doing the best that I can,

15:44.334 --> 15:45.683
but the only fingerprints

15:45.857 --> 15:47.555
that I have on Leo
are from World War II,

15:47.729 --> 15:49.818
and I-I can't use them because

15:49.992 --> 15:51.254
they don't match his photograph.

15:51.428 --> 15:52.777
He's, he's too young.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.257
Okay, Darryl,
but you have to find him.

15:54.431 --> 15:55.737
I will, I promise.

15:55.911 --> 15:57.391
It just might take
a little time.

15:57.565 --> 15:58.914
Well, how long?

15:59.088 --> 16:00.742
Long enough
that he has a-a whole new life,

16:00.916 --> 16:02.309
a new wife and new kids?

16:02.483 --> 16:04.615
Okay, that is not okay,
that is not acceptable!

16:04.789 --> 16:06.487
Piper, just take a breath.Okay, look,

16:06.661 --> 16:08.402
I don't need to take a breath.
I need to find my husband!

16:09.533 --> 16:10.578
[sighs]

16:10.752 --> 16:11.753
[phone beeps off]

16:11.927 --> 16:13.624
[sighs]

16:13.798 --> 16:15.583
[breath quivering]

16:15.757 --> 16:18.890
[panting]

16:19.065 --> 16:21.589
Oh, God!

16:21.763 --> 16:23.634
Somebody please help me!

16:23.808 --> 16:26.159
[loud breathing]

16:28.291 --> 16:30.946
Oh!

16:40.434 --> 16:42.566
Oh, no!

16:42.740 --> 16:44.046
Am I dead again?!

16:44.220 --> 16:46.092
COLE:
No.

16:46.266 --> 16:49.834
Well, not yet anyway.

16:58.539 --> 16:59.844
I don't know which is worse--

17:00.019 --> 17:02.021
the fact that I'm dying, or that

17:02.195 --> 17:03.413
apparently,
I'm gonna be spending

17:03.587 --> 17:05.328
my last dying moments with you.

17:05.502 --> 17:08.288
I'd say that's what
you should be worried about.

17:09.767 --> 17:11.595
You're not looking so hot.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.772
What?
What?

17:14.946 --> 17:16.774
Don't what me, Cole.
What are you doing here?

17:16.948 --> 17:18.167
You called for me.

17:18.341 --> 17:19.734
I didn't call for you.

17:19.908 --> 17:20.996
You asked for help.

17:21.170 --> 17:22.563
Here I am.

17:22.737 --> 17:24.260
Like hell! You're the answer
to my prayers?

17:24.434 --> 17:25.914
I don't think so.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.481
That's just plain...PHOEBE:
Piper? Oh, my God!

17:27.655 --> 17:29.091
Piper!

17:29.265 --> 17:30.353
Piper, wake up!

17:30.527 --> 17:32.355
Piper?

17:32.529 --> 17:33.965
Yoo-hoo, guys.
Hi. Over here.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.358
They can't
hear you.

17:35.532 --> 17:36.751
Oh, my God.
Or see you.

17:36.925 --> 17:38.187
PAIGE:
Thorn demon.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.102
I knew I should have
had Leo heal her.

17:40.276 --> 17:41.886
Or maybe it's the shock
of losing Leo?

17:42.061 --> 17:43.236
Or maybe both.
PIPER:
Guys, yoo-hoo.

17:43.410 --> 17:44.715
Look. Really,
over here. Watch.

17:44.889 --> 17:45.890
[soft groan]

17:46.065 --> 17:47.066
Nice try.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.632
Shut up!

17:48.806 --> 17:51.940
I've run into a few
of these thorn demons myself.

17:52.114 --> 17:53.550
Those pricks
can be vicious.

17:53.724 --> 17:54.986
Pun intended.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.771
The poison works slowly,
but it's also fatal.

17:56.945 --> 17:59.121
Wait. Fatal?! Okay,
guys, I don't see
any other choice.

17:59.295 --> 18:01.428
We're gonna have
to call the Elders
to heal her.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.169
Over my dead body!PAIGE:
Are you kidding?

18:03.343 --> 18:05.388
Piper will kill us!At least
she'll be alive.

18:05.562 --> 18:06.781
PAIGE:

18:06.955 --> 18:08.435

18:08.609 --> 18:09.914
have some sort of
options or something.

that we can do.Well, there's

18:14.528 --> 18:16.138
something we can do, all right--
we got to find Leo.

help us anymore.

the only one who can.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.973
Perhaps you were working
for the greater good.

27:51.147 --> 27:52.975
You know, helping people
when you lost your memory.

27:53.149 --> 27:55.804
Hey, maybe deep down,
you sense that the people

27:55.978 --> 27:57.588
that you were helping
still need you.

27:57.763 --> 28:01.070
Guess I have to hang in there
till my memory comes back, huh?

28:01.244 --> 28:02.376
Yep.

28:02.550 --> 28:03.899
Listen to that
inner voice.

28:04.073 --> 28:05.945
You know, you sound more
like a man of the cloth

28:06.119 --> 28:07.424
than a truck driver.

28:07.598 --> 28:08.991
In a way, maybe I am.

28:09.165 --> 28:12.473
You learn a lot about
life on the road.

28:12.647 --> 28:14.605
I mean, sure, it's lonely
sometimes, but I take heart

28:14.780 --> 28:17.913
in knowing that whatever
sacrifices I make personally,

28:18.087 --> 28:19.610
I'm still bringing
people what they need.

28:19.785 --> 28:21.787
And to me, that's
what it's all about.

28:21.961 --> 28:23.266
Say, I'm gonna be
heading north here soon.

28:23.440 --> 28:24.790
You're welcome to
join us if you want.

28:24.964 --> 28:26.922
Us?

28:27.096 --> 28:28.794
Others who, uh,
who think like I do.

28:28.968 --> 28:30.099
You know, who
want to help.

28:30.273 --> 28:31.622
Of course, if you think

28:31.797 --> 28:32.928
that you're meant
to be somewhere else,

28:33.102 --> 28:34.321
I mean, that's
okay, too,

28:34.495 --> 28:36.062
because, I mean,
look, it's up to you.

28:39.065 --> 28:41.458
I'm not quite sure
what's so hard to grasp.

28:41.632 --> 28:43.243
Love transcends
every plane of existence.

28:43.417 --> 28:44.853
All you need to do is

28:45.027 --> 28:46.159
believe in it with
every fiber of your being

28:46.333 --> 28:47.464
and just send it out to Leo.

28:47.638 --> 28:49.292
What does that mean?

28:49.466 --> 28:50.685
I don't understand.

28:50.859 --> 28:51.773
I could never
get through to you.

28:51.947 --> 28:53.296
I could always sense

28:53.470 --> 28:55.690
when there was something
wrong with Phoebe.

28:55.864 --> 28:57.823
Well, clearly Leo is not sensing

28:57.997 --> 28:59.433
that something is
horribly wrong with me.

28:59.607 --> 29:01.435
That's because
he doesn't know who you are.

29:01.609 --> 29:03.219
Which means
it's gonna take

29:03.393 --> 29:05.744
a bigger jolt from you
to jog his memory.

29:05.918 --> 29:09.051
You know, it's odd how invested
you are in all of this,

29:09.225 --> 29:10.749
considering I'm the one
who helped vanquish you.

29:10.923 --> 29:14.622
Well, you know...
bygones and all.

29:14.796 --> 29:15.710
But you're changing the subject.

29:15.884 --> 29:17.277
Yes, I am.

29:17.451 --> 29:19.192
And this is
not gonna go

29:19.366 --> 29:22.978
any further until you tell me
what you're getting out of this.

29:23.152 --> 29:23.979
Me?

29:25.111 --> 29:26.242
I don't know
what you're talking about.

29:26.416 --> 29:27.896
Come on, Cole,

29:28.070 --> 29:29.898
I know you just as well
as you think you know me.

29:30.072 --> 29:31.595
So if you want me

29:31.770 --> 29:34.207
to trust you, then you need
to come clean first.

29:41.692 --> 29:43.825
I don't want Phoebe
to give up on love.

29:43.999 --> 29:45.522
What?!

29:45.696 --> 29:47.046
She hasn't been able
to find love since me,

29:47.220 --> 29:49.265
or at least
hold on to it.

29:49.439 --> 29:53.095
And I know that's...
my fault.

29:53.269 --> 29:55.010
Well, maybe you should have
thought of that

29:55.184 --> 29:57.012
before you decided to become
the source of all things evil.

29:57.186 --> 29:59.493
Look, I already feel
guilty enough, all right?

29:59.667 --> 30:01.930
Then why aren't you talking to
Phoebe about this instead of me?

30:02.104 --> 30:03.410
Because you're
my only hope.

30:03.584 --> 30:04.933
I'm cursed to live
in eternity without love

30:05.107 --> 30:06.543
for what I've done,
and I accept that.

30:06.717 --> 30:08.415
But I don't want Phoebe
to be cursed, too.

30:08.589 --> 30:10.983
She needs love, she,
she deserves it.

30:11.157 --> 30:12.636
But she's not gonna
keep looking for it

30:12.811 --> 30:14.029
unless you give her a reason to.

30:14.203 --> 30:17.337
Now, you and Leo
are that reason.

30:17.511 --> 30:18.338
Okay.

30:18.512 --> 30:20.209
All right.

30:20.383 --> 30:23.299
So how do I do
this love beacon thing?

30:23.473 --> 30:25.475
All you need to do is let go,

30:25.649 --> 30:27.695
so that you move on
to the next cosmic plane.

30:27.869 --> 30:29.262
Oh, I see.

30:29.436 --> 30:30.872
You mean,
the one where I'm dead.

30:31.046 --> 30:32.482
I know it sounds crazy,

30:32.656 --> 30:33.483
but it's the only way
to get through to Leo.

30:33.657 --> 30:35.529
No. I can't.

30:35.703 --> 30:37.009
I have a family,

30:37.183 --> 30:38.575
I have boys that need me.

30:38.749 --> 30:39.707
Besides, that doesn't
even make any sense.

30:39.881 --> 30:41.230
Yes, it does.

30:41.404 --> 30:43.537
Think about how a person
halfway across the world

30:43.711 --> 30:45.844
knows the instant
their loved one is hit by a car.

30:46.018 --> 30:47.846
It's because
they're struck with

30:48.020 --> 30:50.457
a sudden burst of love,
a psychic shock.

30:50.631 --> 30:52.111
The kind of shock
that can only come

30:52.285 --> 30:53.547
from total loss
of a loved one.

30:53.721 --> 30:56.028
You need to let go.

30:57.290 --> 30:58.944
You need to die.

30:59.118 --> 31:01.816
And what happens
when that doesn't work?

31:01.990 --> 31:04.123
What happens when he doesn't
feel this psychic jolt?

31:04.297 --> 31:05.428
Then I'm just plain dead.

31:05.602 --> 31:07.735
I can't take
that chance.

31:07.909 --> 31:10.738
Besides, my sisters will
figure out a way to save me.

31:10.912 --> 31:12.566
They always do.

31:12.740 --> 31:14.350
Then you risk losing Leo
and your boys,

31:14.524 --> 31:17.092
for good.

31:17.266 --> 31:18.659
Can you take that chance?

31:25.144 --> 31:26.580
Well, this is where
I head north.

31:26.754 --> 31:27.842
What's it gonna be?

31:28.016 --> 31:28.930
You know, I've been
thinking a lot

31:29.104 --> 31:29.931
about that work
you're doing.

31:30.105 --> 31:31.846
I can assure you,

31:32.020 --> 31:33.630
there is nothing
more rewarding.

31:33.804 --> 31:37.069
Be nice to have
a sense of purpose.

31:39.071 --> 31:41.508
[tires screeching]

31:41.682 --> 31:42.726
You need to
make a choice.

31:42.901 --> 31:43.727
Every man does.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.426
I know.

31:46.600 --> 31:47.557
This has to be it.

31:47.731 --> 31:49.081
I hope we're
not too late.

31:49.255 --> 31:51.344
Your destiny lies
ahead of you.

31:51.518 --> 31:53.172
Which way is it gonna be?

31:56.566 --> 31:58.003
Let's go.

32:00.092 --> 32:02.181
You made the
right decision.

32:04.096 --> 32:05.271
Leo, thank God.

32:05.445 --> 32:06.794
Sorry, do I know you?

32:06.968 --> 32:08.274
What are you
doing here?

32:08.448 --> 32:09.797
And what did
you do to Leo?

32:09.971 --> 32:12.582
We let destiny
run its course.

32:12.756 --> 32:13.801
And so should you.

32:24.551 --> 32:25.639
Piper?

32:25.813 --> 32:27.075
I got here as
soon as I could.

32:27.249 --> 32:28.468
The damn Elders.

32:28.642 --> 32:29.948
None of this
would be happening

32:30.122 --> 32:31.253
if they didn't take Leo.

32:31.427 --> 32:32.689
Okay, you know what,
you're right.

32:32.863 --> 32:34.213
We have to get the
Elders down here.

32:34.387 --> 32:35.257
They're the only ones
who can help now.

32:35.431 --> 32:36.476
That won't do any good.

32:36.650 --> 32:37.694
Even if they
heal her body,

32:37.868 --> 32:38.957
only Leo can
heal her soul.

32:39.131 --> 32:40.262
Well, unfortunately,

32:40.436 --> 32:42.047
Leo chose the Elders over Piper.

32:42.221 --> 32:43.570
It's not like
we can get him

32:43.744 --> 32:45.398
here and force him
to remember his wife.

32:45.572 --> 32:46.921
But you can.

32:47.095 --> 32:49.402
And you'd better do it fast.

32:49.576 --> 32:51.795
Trust me, it's
your only hope.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.450
And hers.

32:54.624 --> 32:56.800
Your destiny's with Leo.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.933
You need to learn
to trust that.

33:08.943 --> 33:10.858
This can't be a dead end.

33:11.032 --> 33:13.034
Yeah, well, let me
double-check The Book.

33:13.208 --> 33:15.906
I was very thorough;
there's nothing there.

33:16.081 --> 33:16.907
[gasps]What...

33:17.082 --> 33:18.257
What was that?

33:18.431 --> 33:19.519
Leo.

33:22.783 --> 33:23.958
Wait, I know what to do.

33:24.132 --> 33:25.133
Orb me to the bridge.

33:25.307 --> 33:26.265
No, she just
woke up.

33:26.439 --> 33:27.353
We can't just
leave her.

33:27.527 --> 33:29.007
I'll stay with her,

33:29.181 --> 33:30.617
you go work on
her spirit.Bridge, now!

33:38.190 --> 33:40.105
You can do it, Piper.

33:45.414 --> 33:47.242
Look, we know
you have Leo.

33:47.416 --> 33:49.070
Bring him down
here now.

33:50.941 --> 33:52.508
Leo,

33:52.682 --> 33:54.249
Piper's dying;
you have to come with us.

33:54.423 --> 33:55.642
I'm sorry... who?

33:55.816 --> 33:58.123
He doesn't know
who she is or who you are.

33:58.297 --> 33:59.950
You did this to him.

34:00.125 --> 34:01.691
Leo has chosen
his own path.

34:01.865 --> 34:03.563
By you leading him there?

34:03.737 --> 34:05.347
How is this a fair test?

34:05.521 --> 34:07.523
Some things are
so important

34:07.697 --> 34:09.438
that they cannot
be left to chance.

34:09.612 --> 34:12.528
You need to come home now
because Piper needs you.

34:12.702 --> 34:15.401
Well, I'm there for
all those in need.

34:15.575 --> 34:16.924
Look, this is not a test.

34:17.098 --> 34:18.447
He's made his
own decision.

34:18.621 --> 34:19.840
It's done.

34:20.014 --> 34:20.928
PHOEBE:
No it's not done.

34:21.102 --> 34:22.451
Leo and Piper are still in love.

34:22.625 --> 34:23.887
You can erase
his memory,

34:24.062 --> 34:25.324
but you can't
erase that.

34:25.498 --> 34:27.065
It'll seep
into his consciousness

34:27.239 --> 34:28.457
until he remembers.

34:28.631 --> 34:29.719
I know this
is a great

34:29.893 --> 34:31.373
loss for you.

34:31.547 --> 34:32.809
And that you're going
to need time to mourn.

34:32.983 --> 34:33.723
PHEOBE:
No.

34:33.897 --> 34:34.942
We won't.

34:35.116 --> 34:36.378
Because he's not
going to leave.

34:36.552 --> 34:38.380
You can't take him away
from Piper.

34:38.554 --> 34:40.034
Look, their
love is true,

34:40.208 --> 34:41.340
it's a true love,

34:41.514 --> 34:42.906
and it's bigger
than you,

34:43.081 --> 34:45.953
and... and the Elders,
and... all of this.

34:47.520 --> 34:48.347
[soft gasp]

34:48.521 --> 34:49.870
Leo.

34:51.437 --> 34:53.091
[wheezing]

34:58.357 --> 34:59.184
Piper.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.142
Leo?

35:02.665 --> 35:04.580
Leo, what are
you doing?

35:04.754 --> 35:05.494
Leo?

35:07.366 --> 35:08.193
Wha...

35:16.810 --> 35:18.768
Oh, my God, Leo.

35:20.944 --> 35:23.730
Phoebe.

35:23.904 --> 35:24.774
What the hell
just happened?

35:24.948 --> 35:26.820
He has fallen from grace.

35:26.994 --> 35:28.213
Leo, are you okay?

35:28.387 --> 35:30.040
Take me to Piper. She needs me.

35:30.215 --> 35:31.781
Destiny has spoken.

35:31.955 --> 35:33.305
He's made his choice.

35:33.479 --> 35:35.002
He's mortal now.

35:37.178 --> 35:38.745
You should hurry.

35:46.579 --> 35:48.407
You're too late.

35:48.581 --> 35:50.931
Wyatt already
healed her.

35:51.105 --> 35:52.715
Wyatt?
Thank God.

35:54.717 --> 35:56.850
Good job, baby.

35:57.024 --> 35:58.721
Okay, how did you know
he could do that?

35:58.895 --> 36:00.419
I didn't... he did.

36:00.593 --> 36:02.203
He even put
it in The Book.

36:02.377 --> 36:04.379
Looks like you got
a second-generation

36:04.553 --> 36:05.598
whitelighter
on your hands.

36:05.772 --> 36:07.774
PHOEBE:
Did you heal your mommy?

36:07.948 --> 36:10.994
You're such a big boy,
I'm so proud of you.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.388
I thought you were never going
to find your way home.

36:13.562 --> 36:16.174
It was your faith
that brought me back.

36:16.348 --> 36:18.045
I could hear you
calling me.

36:18.219 --> 36:19.786
Like you were
right there next to me.

36:19.960 --> 36:23.442
I had a good coach.

36:24.573 --> 36:26.227
An old friend.

36:26.401 --> 36:28.229
I'll explain later.

36:29.709 --> 36:30.840
That looks like

36:31.014 --> 36:32.320
it hurts.

36:32.494 --> 36:34.627
Yeah, it
doesn't matter.

36:34.801 --> 36:37.934
All that matters is
that we're together again.

36:39.371 --> 36:41.286
I'm never leaving you again.

36:48.162 --> 36:49.381
PIPER:
Come here, buddy.

36:49.555 --> 36:50.512
Come here.

36:50.686 --> 36:52.775
Look who it is.

36:52.949 --> 36:54.516
Can you give
daddy a hug?

36:54.690 --> 36:56.083
Hug, hug, hug.

36:56.257 --> 36:57.650
Oh.
This much.

37:01.828 --> 37:05.440
DRAKE:
"Like as the waves make
towards the pebbled shore,

37:05.614 --> 37:08.791
