<i>Okay. Everyone ready?</i>

00:05.840 --> 00:07.506
Breakfast. Check.

Card. Check.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.075
Present.
Check.

00:11.277 --> 00:13.212
Why is the present buzzing?

00:13.214 --> 00:14.880
Mom loves honey.

00:14.882 --> 00:16.682
It's a new strain
of honey bees.

00:16.684 --> 00:19.551
Yeah. They make twice
the honey of normal bees.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.887
I bet they sting
twice as much, too.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.522
Well, duh!
Well, duh!

00:23.524 --> 00:25.958
Boys, I'm going to say no
to the bees.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.659
Let's go with the flowers.

00:28.561 --> 00:30.295
ALL:
Happy Mother's Day.

00:30.297 --> 00:31.930
Breakfast in bed?

00:31.932 --> 00:32.998
Oh, how nice.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.299
We made you a card.

00:34.301 --> 00:36.168
Dad made me give you these.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.836
Weren't those on the hall table?

00:37.838 --> 00:39.772
The tweebs wanted to
give you mutant bees.

00:39.774 --> 00:42.574
( <i>phone rings</i>) Thanks.
Dr. Possible.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.109
No. I've got
a lobo at 10:00.

00:44.111 --> 00:46.078
( <i>phone rings</i>) Let's go, Wade.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.112
Maybe I can squeeze in
something after lunch.

00:47.114 --> 00:48.047
Just tell her majesty we'll wait

00:48.049 --> 00:48.847
until the spring thaw.

00:48.849 --> 00:51.150
Hey!
Hey!

00:51.152 --> 00:52.718
When was the last time

00:52.720 --> 00:55.254
you two shared some quality
mother-daughter bonding?

00:55.256 --> 00:56.922
Well, there was
that one time...

00:56.924 --> 00:59.091
No, Kimmy. We had
to cancel that. Remember?

00:59.093 --> 01:00.626
My point exactly.

01:00.628 --> 01:02.628
I want you two
to take Mother's Day off

01:02.630 --> 01:04.329
and spend it together
no matter what.

01:04.331 --> 01:05.697
What about Jim and Tim?

01:05.699 --> 01:08.167
Honey time!

We're going
to be busy beekeepers.

I'd spend the day with her.

I made the same promise.

Dude, you actually
left your room?

05:05.339 --> 05:07.406

I had brunch brought in.

some cheddar cheese.

How about I glue macaronis
to a coffee can

and then, like,
spray paint it gold?

Ronald, if you want
to make me happy,

05:53.087 --> 05:55.253
clean this garage.

Oh, no!

There's my old Hacky Sack.

to plan our next move

06:09.169 --> 06:11.503
against Impossible.

06:11.505 --> 06:14.139
The perimeter is fortified
with nitro-phased post cannons,

06:14.141 --> 06:16.475
and any movement will
be detected by these

Hello, listener.

06:41.902 --> 06:45.570
My advice to you is to get in
touch with your feminine side.

06:45.572 --> 06:48.039
Yes! Oh!

06:48.041 --> 06:49.408
Okay, I'm confused.

06:49.410 --> 06:52.244
And that's perfectly okay.

06:52.246 --> 06:55.380
Those feelings are normal.

06:55.382 --> 06:57.215
Mother doesn't know
I'm a supervillain.

And smart, too.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.560
Yes. That's right, Mother.

07:08.562 --> 07:11.329
And Dr. Drakken is busy
with his show at the moment.

07:11.331 --> 07:13.365
"Drakken" is his stage name.

07:13.367 --> 07:15.634
So, thanks for stopping by.

07:15.636 --> 07:19.070
Is this any way to treat
your mother on her day?

07:19.072 --> 07:19.971
What day?

07:19.973 --> 07:21.173
Mother's Day.

07:21.175 --> 07:23.241
Mother's Day? That's today?

07:23.243 --> 07:25.510
You didn't forget, did you?

07:25.512 --> 07:27.179
No.

07:27.181 --> 07:30.949
What kind of son
would forget Mother's Day?

07:30.951 --> 07:34.186
Not my Drew.
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

07:34.188 --> 07:37.222
I had no idea
how major your job is.

07:37.224 --> 07:41.393
I mean, it's... it's...
well, it's brain surgery.

07:41.395 --> 07:43.728
Oh, you were a big
help in there, Kimmy.

07:43.730 --> 07:45.530
And you didn't faint once.

07:45.532 --> 07:48.433
Oh, I was too busy throwing up.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.535
So, your mother has no idea

07:50.537 --> 07:52.737
that you're trying
to take over the world.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.606
She'll know when
I succeed, won't she?

07:54.608 --> 07:57.342
Drew, what does this button do?

07:57.344 --> 07:58.677
No! Don't touch it!

07:58.679 --> 08:00.145
You'll destroy us all!

08:00.147 --> 08:02.481
I, um...
I mean, Mother,

08:02.483 --> 08:05.250
um, you have to be in the union

08:05.252 --> 08:08.153
to touch
this stuff. Yes.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.556
Oh! Well, I don't want
to get anybody in trouble.

08:11.558 --> 08:13.391
I'm going to make coffee.

08:13.393 --> 08:16.394
I just learned that the
self-replicating synthoplasma

08:16.396 --> 08:19.164
is being transported
to a secret location

08:19.166 --> 08:20.565
by high-speed train.

08:20.567 --> 08:23.134
By calculating the proper
intercept factors,

08:23.136 --> 08:25.537
and implementing
split-second timing,

08:25.539 --> 08:28.273
we'll meet up
with the train here,

08:28.275 --> 08:31.109
and then it will all be mine!

08:31.111 --> 08:32.511
Aren't you a little old

08:32.513 --> 08:35.413
to be playing with your
Peter Puffer Puff Toys?

08:35.415 --> 08:37.616
She's got a point,
Choo Choo Boy.

08:37.618 --> 08:40.385
Don't you think
it's time you settled down

08:40.387 --> 08:41.686
and met a nice girl?

08:41.688 --> 08:44.623
Oh, um... ick!

08:44.625 --> 08:48.260
Okay, we have all day together,
so what will it be?

08:48.262 --> 08:49.694

08:51.431 --> 08:52.764

Wade?

08:52.766 --> 08:55.233
Wade, you're cutting into
mother-daughter time.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.502
Sorry, Kim. I just
intercepted a transmission.

08:57.504 --> 08:59.304
Hold it.
Now you're at the beach?

08:59.306 --> 09:02.340
And soak up all those UVs?
No way!

09:02.342 --> 09:05.544
This is just my holo cube.

09:05.546 --> 09:08.480
Whoo! No wonder this child
never leaves his room.

09:08.482 --> 09:10.615
Anyway, the synthoplasma
is being moved

09:10.617 --> 09:11.683
by high-speed train,

09:11.685 --> 09:13.151
and I'm tracking Drakken,

09:13.153 --> 09:15.053

on the same coordinates.

Great! Okay, better get Ron.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.560
( <i>clearing throat</i>) Mom?

09:21.562 --> 09:24.396
We promised to spend the day
together no matter what.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.131
( <i>groans</i> )

09:28.668 --> 09:31.069
I know we promised
to spend the day together.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.337
No matter what.

09:32.339 --> 09:33.538
But this could get dangerous.

09:33.540 --> 09:34.539
I need Ron.

09:34.541 --> 09:35.807
Well, today you don't have Ron.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.342
Today, you have Mom.

09:37.344 --> 09:38.577
No, no, no,
but you don't understand.

09:41.315 --> 09:43.848
( <i>growls</i> ) Oh, all
right, come on.

09:43.850 --> 09:47.118
What a lovely day for a picnic.

09:47.120 --> 09:50.355
Drew, you spoil me.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.691
Nothing's too good
for my mother.

09:53.526 --> 09:56.094
Everyone follow me.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.396
Ooh. A nature hike.

09:58.398 --> 10:01.499
Did we really need to
bring all of this food?

10:01.501 --> 10:03.735
My little boy needs
a healthy meal

10:03.737 --> 10:05.303
to keep him strong.

Isn't that right, Drewby?

Drewby?

Mother, we agreed...
no Drewby.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.478
I'm a big boy now, remember?

10:13.480 --> 10:16.748
Oh, but you'll
always be my Drewby.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.618
Now, give Mama
a great big huggy.

10:19.620 --> 10:22.887

Yes, mother.

This is a global

I know exactly where I'm going.

Oh, my, that <i>is</i> a pretty spot.

11:02.294 --> 11:05.230
Aren't we going a little fast?

11:05.232 --> 11:06.798
We've got to catch this train.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.400
I know, but...

Are you kidding?

11:36.863 --> 11:38.296
That was awesome.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.831
I have to get
your father to try this.

Heh. Great idea.

11:42.835 --> 11:44.703
( <i>grunts</i> )

12:08.694 --> 12:09.794
( <i>shrieks</i>)

12:09.796 --> 12:13.231
So, Mr. Garden Gnome,
we meet again.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.400
It's been awhile.

12:30.783 --> 12:35.353
This time you're on my turf,
and I'm taking out the trash.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.355
Ron!

12:37.357 --> 12:38.723
Ron!

12:38.725 --> 12:39.724
I'm sorry, Mr. Gnome!

12:39.726 --> 12:41.326
I didn't mean to call you trash.

12:41.328 --> 12:42.694
Ron, it's me, Wade.

12:42.696 --> 12:43.862
Don't play me, Gnome.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.663
I switched to a
high-end resonance band

12:45.665 --> 12:47.599
to use this porcelain
figure as a receiver.

12:47.601 --> 12:48.867
Kim's on Drakken's trail.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.269
Hey, if it gets me out
of cleaning the garage,

12:51.271 --> 12:52.337
I am so out of here.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.572
I am so staying here.

12:54.574 --> 12:57.342
The train will come
from this direction and then...

12:57.344 --> 12:58.643
Bam! Avalanche!

12:58.645 --> 13:00.612
Then we take the synthoplasma.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.580
Drew Lipsky!

13:02.582 --> 13:05.049
What have I told you
about playing with your food?

13:05.051 --> 13:08.319
Aah... "My food is not a toy.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.488
It's for my tummy to enjoy."

Mmm.

13:27.373 --> 13:28.506

And, uh, where's the street?

13:33.079 --> 13:34.546

13:56.736 --> 13:59.070
So, it'll stop
before we hit that?

13:59.072 --> 14:01.072
That's my hope.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.676
I think I broke the brakes.

14:04.678 --> 14:07.512
Something has to
slow this down.

14:10.816 --> 14:13.017
Kimmy, we're going faster.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.353
Let's see if Wade can help.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.355
Wade, you're hotlinked into

14:17.357 --> 14:18.623
the controls
of a speeding train

14:18.625 --> 14:19.657
that needs to stop now.

14:19.659 --> 14:20.992
I'm on it.

14:20.994 --> 14:24.796
Honey, you built this
facial gizmo yourself? Ooh...

14:24.798 --> 14:26.998
Glad you like it, Mom.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.833
Ooh, bad news.
Looks like the brake's broken.

14:28.835 --> 14:29.868
BOTH:
We know.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.069
It gets worse.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.370
There's a rock slide up ahead.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.671
BOTH:
We know.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.874
Okay, the train
has an advanced power source.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.141
A little rewiring and I think

14:37.143 --> 14:39.010
we can divert
an energy blast from the engine

14:39.012 --> 14:40.445
to tunnel through the rocks.

14:40.447 --> 14:41.913
Kimmy.
I can't reach

14:41.915 --> 14:44.716
these two wires in the back.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.818
This is just like
the spinal juncture.

14:46.820 --> 14:48.620
I say we need a
surgeon's touch.

14:57.830 --> 15:00.999
Aah! Only one person
could have done that!

Mm! Uh... It's
a complicated

Come, we have to
catch that train.

This Kim must be some
special girl, huh?

You're loving this, aren't you?

16:20.146 --> 16:21.679
I could use some coffee.

have a dining car?

of Shego and Drakken.

Mmm. I think
I smell coffee.

You look for that
dining car now.

16:40.967 --> 16:42.734
You want I should
bring you a cup?

16:42.736 --> 16:43.901
Thank you, no, Mother.

16:43.903 --> 16:45.036
Now, then.

16:45.038 --> 16:47.038
When we reach the
gorge, I'll be...

Come, Shego.
Let's get what we came for.

16:52.946 --> 16:54.145
Nicely done, Mom.

16:54.147 --> 16:56.014
And kind of fun, too.

you make
an outstanding sidekick.

Anything for my
little bubble...

Finally,
the most secret substance

17:26.012 --> 17:27.178
in the world is mine.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.746
Drew, you lie.

There's no dining
car on this train.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.951
Is that what I think it is.

17:33.953 --> 17:35.053
A thermos of coffee.

17:35.055 --> 17:37.555
Oh, such a good boy.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.656
I'll go get the pie

from our picnic basket, okay?

Huh?!

Oh! Hey. I caught it.

17:47.700 --> 17:48.966
Great! Just don't...

17:48.968 --> 17:49.934
I'll take that.

17:49.936 --> 17:51.169
lose it.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.738
I guess that's not what
Ron would have done.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.908
You've never actually
seen Ron in action, have you?

17:56.910 --> 17:58.943
Let it go.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.678
Hand it over.

Everyone out.

18:41.820 --> 18:43.187
If you ask me,

18:43.189 --> 18:47.959
this part of your treatment
seems a bit extreme, but...

18:47.961 --> 18:49.694
my son, the doctor.

18:51.196 --> 18:53.097
We've got company.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.104
What have I told you
about leaving a room

19:00.106 --> 19:01.706
without saying good-bye?

19:01.708 --> 19:03.774
Sorry about my Drewby.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.943
He's not usually rude.

19:05.945 --> 19:08.946
Good-bye and good luck
with your treatment.

19:10.082 --> 19:10.948
What would Ron do now?

19:10.950 --> 19:12.049
Probably cry.

19:12.051 --> 19:13.718
Or run. Wade?

19:15.420 --> 19:16.854
Interesting.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.890
I think it responds
to electrical impulses.

19:20.259 --> 19:22.059
Talk about it later.
Come on, Mom.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.735
The more it eats,
the bigger it gets.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.170
Just like your brothers.

Can't stop eating junk.

19:33.206 --> 19:34.172
Jump!

Yeah, but at <i>that</i>
<i>end of the train.</i>

19:41.346 --> 19:44.348
Oh, swell,
the gelatinous mass ate it.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.450
Do you know how much
that thing cost?

19:46.452 --> 19:47.785
It wasn't cheap.

19:47.787 --> 19:48.986
Fine.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.955
We'll keep the train
and lose the passengers.

19:56.094 --> 19:58.863
What about your mother?

20:00.098 --> 20:01.999
I went back for the pie!

20:02.001 --> 20:03.768
My mother!

20:03.770 --> 20:04.969
I forgot about her.

20:07.139 --> 20:09.807
Drew Theodore
P. Lipsky.

20:09.809 --> 20:10.708
Were you trying

20:10.710 --> 20:11.909
to leave me back there?

20:11.911 --> 20:14.445
No, of course not.

20:14.447 --> 20:18.249
It was... a special...
test, a jump test.

20:18.251 --> 20:19.784
Yes, and you passed.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.819
Oh. I did?

20:21.821 --> 20:24.422
Yes. Happy Jumping Mother's Day.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.824
Shego, take them out.

20:33.198 --> 20:35.433
Farewell, Kim Possible.

20:35.435 --> 20:39.203
Oh, it's so nice to see
my son, the doctor,

20:39.205 --> 20:40.438
helping people.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.342
We're running out of train.

20:44.344 --> 20:46.110
I can try shocking it again,

20:46.112 --> 20:47.411
but it's so big now.

20:47.413 --> 20:48.913
Wait. Don't shoot it.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.381
Talk to it.
Mom.

20:50.383 --> 20:52.416
It's an out-of-control,
matter-eating monster.

20:53.218 --> 20:55.119
I know, but its reactions

20:55.121 --> 20:56.354
to current are similar

20:56.356 --> 20:58.823
to the electrical impulses
in the brain.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.493
This should...

21:04.596 --> 21:06.130
not do that.

21:06.132 --> 21:08.499
Can't you tell it
to take a nap?

21:11.903 --> 21:13.070
Come on.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.809
Let's see if this sequence
will calm it down.

21:21.213 --> 21:22.947
Theta waves.

21:22.949 --> 21:23.948
I did it.

21:26.084 --> 21:27.151
( <i>gasps</i> )

21:30.822 --> 21:33.391
In the zone.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.229
Gross, it's drooling.

21:38.231 --> 21:40.798
Not exactly the way
I thought we'd spend the day.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.932
But we spent it together.

21:41.934 --> 21:43.234
No matter what.

21:43.236 --> 21:46.103
So, now what do we do
with this guy?

21:47.372 --> 21:48.506
I don't know how to thank you,

21:48.508 --> 21:49.507
Kim Possible.

21:49.509 --> 21:51.575
The self-replicating
synthoplasma

21:51.577 --> 21:53.277
can be very dangerous.

21:53.279 --> 21:56.113
Not a problem, especially once
you know how to talk to it.

21:56.115 --> 21:58.049
Where is the synthoplasma now?

21:58.051 --> 21:59.050
It kept on eating.

21:59.052 --> 22:01.218
We had to feed it something.

22:01.220 --> 22:03.020
Plus, Mom gets
a nice, clean garage

22:03.022 --> 22:04.488
and I didn't even
break a sweat.

22:10.028 --> 22:12.096
What's with the garden gnome?

22:12.098 --> 22:16.167
KP... Whatever you do,
don't make eye contact.
