00:14.014 --> 00:15.616
Previously on
"Better Call Saul"...

00:15.716 --> 00:17.118
I think there's a way
to get Sandpiper settled

00:17.218 --> 00:18.419
and leave him standing.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.288
Maybe the trick is,
we're not working on Howard.

00:20.388 --> 00:21.522
Not at first.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.091
You've got
two dozen lawyers up there,

00:23.191 --> 00:25.259
and it's my fault
you can't keep track of Lalo?

00:25.359 --> 00:27.661
I meant De Guzman.

00:27.761 --> 00:30.264
Varga's alone
in foreign territory.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.999
He's gonna get caught.

00:34.568 --> 00:37.305
You're not doing that.

00:37.405 --> 00:38.606
He wants to talk to you.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.210
iJefe!

06:53.313 --> 06:55.382
Un campesino.

06:55.483 --> 06:57.951
Tal vez lo vio.

10:20.187 --> 10:23.056
Gracias.

10:57.557 --> 11:00.027
Señor.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.437
Gracias.

11:43.203 --> 11:46.173
A to Z Fine Upholstery.

11:46.273 --> 11:47.474
Hello?

11:47.574 --> 11:48.641
Dad.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.978
It's me.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.645
Nacho?

11:52.746 --> 11:55.315
Sí, Papa.

12:05.793 --> 12:09.162
Um.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.106
Nacho...

12:36.089 --> 12:38.058
Okay.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.124
Hm?

14:03.043 --> 14:05.445
Yeah.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.581
It's me.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.083
Yeah.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.784
You knew.

14:11.885 --> 14:14.321
You knew that I was going
to Mexico to die,

14:14.421 --> 14:16.856
that I was never supposed to
make it out of that motel.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.492
And you
let it happen.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.328
Not my call.

14:21.428 --> 14:23.430
What happens now?

14:23.530 --> 14:26.033
That's up to you.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.835
Is that bastard
with you?

14:28.936 --> 14:31.138
Put him on.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.040
Hm.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.808
He wants
to talk to you.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.187
Yes.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.356
You are screwed.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.393
You want the cartel
to blame me for Lalo.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.963
But if they catch me,
make me talk --

14:56.063 --> 14:59.832
that is not good for you, is it?

14:59.933 --> 15:01.334
Even if I disappear,

15:01.434 --> 15:04.537
everyone's gonna smell
your stink all over it.

15:04.637 --> 15:09.376
The only way that this works
for you is with me dead.

15:17.985 --> 15:20.153
Alright.

15:20.253 --> 15:23.090
Whatever bullshit way
you want the story to go,

15:23.190 --> 15:24.524
I will make it go.

15:24.624 --> 15:28.996
But...I need one thing.

15:29.096 --> 15:30.730
Yes?

15:30.830 --> 15:33.233
My dad.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.236
I need to know
that he'll be safe.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.739
If you are true
to your word,

15:39.839 --> 15:43.676
there will be no reason
for anyone to harm your father.

15:45.145 --> 15:49.216
You are not the one
that I need to hear it from.

15:56.856 --> 15:58.925
Your dad's
gonna be okay.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.260
How do you know?

16:00.360 --> 16:03.096
Because anyone
who goes after him

16:03.196 --> 16:05.432
is gonna have to
come through me.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.961
Zip?

17:10.763 --> 17:11.931
All set.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.166
What's up?

17:13.266 --> 17:16.836
Well, I'm just thinking
about the timeline.

17:16.936 --> 17:17.837
Let me.

17:17.937 --> 17:19.872
Everything has to go off
by the 18th.

17:19.972 --> 17:22.142
That's the target date,
right?
Uh-huh.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.511
And before that,
just for the driving work,

17:24.611 --> 17:27.380
we're saying we want, uh,
the right year and model --

17:27.480 --> 17:29.015
mint condition,
no less.

17:29.116 --> 17:30.950
And then
get it painted.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.885
Plus we want to get
the custom plates...

17:32.985 --> 17:34.354
So not enough time?

17:34.454 --> 17:36.856
That's what
I'm wondering.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.792
Mm.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.694
Okay.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.730
Here you go.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.532
What if...

17:47.334 --> 17:50.670
What if we used
the real car?

17:50.770 --> 17:52.539
I mean, like,
his real car.

17:52.639 --> 17:53.873
His car?

17:53.973 --> 17:56.343
That's a bit direct.

17:56.443 --> 18:01.080
I think the word you're
looking for is "audacious."

18:01.181 --> 18:02.582
That, too.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.717
But it's a real risk,
'cause, uh,

18:04.817 --> 18:07.053
we're exposed
when we take it,

18:07.154 --> 18:08.221
and then, what?

18:08.321 --> 18:09.889
Just --
Just put it back?

18:09.989 --> 18:12.392
Pretend some kids
took it for a joyride?

18:12.492 --> 18:14.927
I mean, there's a dozen ways
we tip our hand.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.410
I got it.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.679
Valet scam.
Hm?

18:32.779 --> 18:34.214
How does that work?

18:34.314 --> 18:35.948
Well,
it wouldn't be me.

18:36.048 --> 18:38.851
This has got Huell's name
written all over it.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.253
Huell?
Yeah.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.355
He knows Huell
from your hearing.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.890
Yeah,
but if we do it right,

18:43.990 --> 18:46.125
Huell will be invisible.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.560
Oh, yeah?

18:47.660 --> 18:49.262
Like a ghost.

18:49.362 --> 18:51.598
That's pretty slick.

18:51.698 --> 18:54.567
I think the word you're
looking for is "audacious."

19:21.761 --> 19:23.062
Alright.
Thank you for that.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.964
Try talking...

19:29.236 --> 19:30.570
Oh, hey, Suzanne!

19:30.670 --> 19:31.771
Kim.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.606
Glad I s-spotted you.

19:33.706 --> 19:36.376
I have some new info
on Caldwell.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.813
Am I
reading this right?

19:40.913 --> 19:43.816
This is an out-of-state
misdemeanor arrest report.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.952
On your client.
Yeah.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.354
This is
six years old, Kim.

19:47.454 --> 19:48.521
Yep.

19:48.621 --> 19:51.123
There's no way we ever
would've chased this down.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.159
Why are you
giving this to me?

19:54.461 --> 19:56.529
We're in discovery,
and I discovered it.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.531
I'm supposed to
turn it over.

19:58.631 --> 20:01.834
Besides, we are going to
beat you on the merits.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.636
You can keep
that copy.

20:03.736 --> 20:04.871
I'll see you.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.343
Kim. Kim.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.178
Do you have
a minute?

20:12.279 --> 20:14.614
I'm sure
you recognize this man.

20:14.714 --> 20:18.351
He's a client of Jimmy McGill's,
one Jorge de Guzman.

20:18.451 --> 20:21.688
This -- This is
Eduardo Salamanca.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.222
Same person.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.493
Okay.

20:26.593 --> 20:29.629
And who is
Eduardo Salamanca?

20:29.729 --> 20:31.864
A major drug trafficker.

20:31.964 --> 20:34.401
We got this photo
from Federales in Chihuahua.

20:34.501 --> 20:39.639
Seems Salamanca jumped the
seven million he posted in bail

20:39.739 --> 20:42.008
and fled to Mexico.

20:42.108 --> 20:43.910
Wow.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.378
That's news to me.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.046
How did this
come to light?

20:47.146 --> 20:49.849
He died in a massive firefight
at his compound.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.452
Over a half dozen people
were killed.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.059
That's terrible,

21:00.159 --> 21:02.462
but where are you going
with this?

21:03.463 --> 21:05.332
Bear with me.

21:05.432 --> 21:08.234
Let me explain how this looks
from where I stand.

21:09.502 --> 21:12.572
A couple years back,
Jimmy McGill represented

21:12.672 --> 21:15.041
Ignacio Varga,
a local dealer.

21:15.141 --> 21:18.778
Now, Varga is a known associate
of Tuco Salamanca.

21:18.878 --> 21:21.548
Jimmy was involved
in getting Tuco

21:21.648 --> 21:24.417
a reduced sentence
on an assault and battery charge

21:24.517 --> 21:26.218
shortly after
he represented Varga.

21:26.319 --> 21:30.189
And now here he is,
representing Eduardo Salamanca

21:30.289 --> 21:33.092
under the assumed name
"De Guzman."

21:33.192 --> 21:34.427
Okay.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.363
What are you
getting at?

21:36.463 --> 21:39.932
Are you building some kind of
case against Jimmy?

21:40.032 --> 21:41.267
No.

21:41.368 --> 21:43.936
No one is,
at the moment.

21:44.036 --> 21:45.372
"At the moment."

21:45.472 --> 21:49.376
Gina Khalil thinks
Jimmy knew who De Guzman was.

21:49.476 --> 21:53.413
That Jimmy helped Salamanca
even after he knew.

21:53.513 --> 21:56.115
I'd like
to believe he didn't.

21:56.215 --> 21:57.884
I don't think Jimmy
ever intended

21:57.984 --> 22:00.420
to become
a cartel lawyer.

22:00.520 --> 22:03.289
It's not a suit
that fits him.

22:03.390 --> 22:06.893
I think maybe
he got in over his head

22:06.993 --> 22:08.461
and couldn't get out.

22:08.561 --> 22:12.164
And if that's true --
if Salamanca duped him,

22:12.264 --> 22:17.003
then the lawyer-client privilege
was obtained in bad faith.

22:17.103 --> 22:19.972
You want Jimmy
to rat on a client?

22:20.072 --> 22:23.309
Even if Salamanca's dead,
his privilege survives.

22:23.410 --> 22:24.511
You know that.

22:24.611 --> 22:26.312
If the privilege
was clean.

22:26.413 --> 22:29.181
But if he wasn't in
on the De Guzman deception,

22:29.281 --> 22:30.650
Jimmy could talk to me.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.952
And tell you what?
You just said Salamanca's dead.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.754
His accomplices aren't.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.989
Salamanca was in deep,
and I want to know

22:37.089 --> 22:38.925
what his people are doing
here in Albuquerque.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.327
And Jimmy could help.

22:41.428 --> 22:44.296
I'll make sure
anything he tells me

22:44.397 --> 22:45.632
won't blow back.

22:45.732 --> 22:49.135
And if it turns out
that Jimmy's made mistakes --

22:49.235 --> 22:51.370
we won't
hold him accountable.

22:51.471 --> 22:53.372
I'm talking to you
because I think

22:53.473 --> 22:56.275
you'll be more willing
to hear what I have to say.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.378
Look,
we had a monster in custody.

23:00.780 --> 23:03.182
And we just let him
walk right out of jail.

23:03.282 --> 23:04.517
We failed.

23:04.617 --> 23:07.353
The whole system
just failed.

23:07.454 --> 23:10.990
This guy
killed a 22-year-old kid.

23:11.090 --> 23:13.460
Dead.
In cold blood.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.727
It's wrong.

23:14.827 --> 23:16.796
You know it's wrong.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.999
And I think
Jimmy does, too.

23:20.099 --> 23:22.201
Saul.

23:22.301 --> 23:24.203
I'm sorry?

23:24.303 --> 23:26.973
He practices now
under the name Saul Goodman.

23:27.073 --> 23:29.241
Although
I distinctly remember

23:29.341 --> 23:32.278
you referring to him
as a "scumbag."

23:34.781 --> 23:39.318
Uh, I admit I have had
my problems with...Saul.

23:39.418 --> 23:40.553
That's true.

23:40.653 --> 23:43.556
But I also believe
underneath it all --

23:43.656 --> 23:47.393
underneath all of his...
showiness --

23:47.494 --> 23:49.061
he's a lawyer.

23:49.161 --> 23:50.997
And a human being.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.766
And I think he knows
what's right.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.974
When?

25:43.876 --> 25:46.713
Tomorrow.

25:48.147 --> 25:50.883
Tomorrow.

26:05.932 --> 26:08.200
Boss says
he looks too pretty.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.640
Want me
to take care of it?

26:13.740 --> 26:15.407
No.

26:15.507 --> 26:17.677
I'll do it.

26:17.777 --> 26:20.613
Now get the hell
outta here.

26:30.623 --> 26:35.194
Gotta make it look real,
right?

26:35.294 --> 26:37.864
Let's get it
over with.

26:47.273 --> 26:50.042
First things first.

27:39.025 --> 27:41.627
Tony, good to see you.

27:41.728 --> 27:43.629
How's night school
treating you?

27:43.730 --> 27:45.231
"A" in Econ,
Mr. Hamlin.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.834
Ah, good for you.
Keep it up!

28:25.304 --> 28:26.873
Oh, uh, sorry, sir.

28:26.973 --> 28:28.140
'Scuse me.
My bad.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.608
No worries.

28:29.708 --> 28:32.144
'Scuse me.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.162
Better get
a move on.

28:50.262 --> 28:53.199
Kid looks quick.

28:58.137 --> 29:02.341
[Beethoven's Piano Concerto
No. 5 in It Flat Major,
Op.- - 3 -
Rondo

29:10.182 --> 29:11.583
Let's go,
yo.

29:25.297 --> 29:27.399
Prolly 'bout 45 seconds.

29:27.499 --> 29:28.667
I'm just sayin'.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.203
Heard you
the first time.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.384
Smooth as glass.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.252
Guy drove away
without a clue.

30:20.352 --> 30:21.553
Great!

30:21.653 --> 30:23.489
And, uh,
how does it work?

30:23.589 --> 30:26.225
Press "four" for unlock.
"Five" for lock.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.127
Rest'll take care
of itself.

30:28.227 --> 30:30.462
Four for unlock,
five for lock...

30:31.931 --> 30:34.166
Alright.

30:35.935 --> 30:39.138
What you asked for,
and a little extra.

30:39.238 --> 30:43.475
Should cover you
and the "keymaster."

30:45.544 --> 30:48.180
Can I ask you summin'?

30:49.081 --> 30:51.150
Sure, go ahead.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.719
Personal, kinda.

30:54.921 --> 30:57.123
Okay. What?

30:57.223 --> 30:58.357
You a lawyer.

30:58.457 --> 31:00.960
You make good money,
right?

31:01.060 --> 31:03.862
Good days and bad,
but, yeah.

31:03.963 --> 31:05.131
Legit money.

31:05.231 --> 31:06.498
On the level.

31:06.598 --> 31:07.766
Yeah. So?

31:07.866 --> 31:09.835
Your wife's a lawyer.

31:09.936 --> 31:11.503
A legit lawyer.

31:11.603 --> 31:13.339
Yeah.

31:14.606 --> 31:17.243
Why you do all this?

31:18.110 --> 31:20.212
Oh,
I gotcha.

31:20.312 --> 31:22.181
I-I know,
from the outside,

31:22.281 --> 31:24.183
this looks like
just another scam.

31:24.283 --> 31:25.617
But

31:25.717 --> 31:27.686
you're not seeing
the bigger picture.

31:27.786 --> 31:29.989
A couple months from now,
there are people whose lives

31:30.089 --> 31:33.025
are gonna be way better
because of this.

31:33.125 --> 31:35.894
A-- We're making
a real difference.

31:35.995 --> 31:37.196
Trust me.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.932
We're doing
the Lord's work here.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.937
If you say so.

31:46.238 --> 31:48.774
Be seeing you.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.066
Hey.

32:14.166 --> 32:16.902
Buckle your safety belts,
boys and girls,

32:17.003 --> 32:20.172
because Huell
came through.

32:25.777 --> 32:28.380
Huell says "hi,"
by the way.

32:29.381 --> 32:31.917
Hu-- Glad to hear it.

32:40.692 --> 32:42.394
What's going on?

32:44.630 --> 32:48.400
I have news,
Jimmy.

32:48.500 --> 32:51.170
Lalo is dead.

32:53.805 --> 32:56.008
Holy shit.

32:56.875 --> 32:58.210
The D.A.'s office
put it together

32:58.310 --> 33:00.912
that Lalo was calling himself
De Guzman.

33:01.013 --> 33:04.950
They are pretty upset
they let him go.

33:05.051 --> 33:07.286
I'll bet they are.

33:07.386 --> 33:10.656
Ericsen seems to think
that if Lalo lied to you

33:10.756 --> 33:12.291
and you didn't know
about the pseudonym,

33:12.391 --> 33:14.393
that you could
break confidentiality.

33:14.493 --> 33:15.761
She wants you
to talk.

33:15.861 --> 33:17.829
She says it's "right."

33:18.597 --> 33:22.301
Well, what do you think
we should do?

33:22.401 --> 33:26.872
You...should do
whatever you want, Jimmy.

33:27.739 --> 33:29.975
They don't have
anything on you.

33:30.076 --> 33:33.879
It's just a fishing expedition
to see if you bite.

33:38.250 --> 33:41.053
You think
I should do it?

33:42.354 --> 33:44.856
It depends.

33:44.956 --> 33:47.126
On what?

33:47.226 --> 33:48.860
Well.

33:50.962 --> 33:55.000
I guess
it's basically --

33:55.101 --> 33:56.768
do you want to be
a "friend of the cartel"?

33:56.868 --> 34:00.906
Or...do you want
to be a rat?

34:53.325 --> 34:55.727
Bolsa will want
to hear the truth from you

34:55.827 --> 34:57.696
before the Salamancas
have you.

34:57.796 --> 35:02.768
Their methods
take too long for his taste.

35:02.868 --> 35:05.070
What will you say?

35:05.171 --> 35:07.739
I'll say
it was Alvarez.

35:07.839 --> 35:10.876
Working for Los Odios
out of Peru.

35:10.976 --> 35:13.412
That, um...

35:13.512 --> 35:17.082
I've been on the payroll
for almost a year.

35:17.183 --> 35:19.084
Alright.

35:20.352 --> 35:22.188
Once you say it,
you get to your feet.

35:22.288 --> 35:25.524
You start running
as fast as you can at Victor.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.460
You'll be zip-tied,
he'll be ready.

35:28.560 --> 35:32.097
Get past him
and keep running.

35:32.198 --> 35:34.466
He'll handle it.

35:34.566 --> 35:38.370
He puts me down,
you mean.

35:38.470 --> 35:41.006
It'll be over quick.

35:57.189 --> 35:59.124
You have
something more to say?

35:59.225 --> 36:01.493
I wanna be there.

36:01.593 --> 36:03.929
The Salamancas
know you.

36:04.029 --> 36:05.464
They know
your face.

36:05.564 --> 36:08.967
I'm not gonna be close enough
for them to eyeball me.

36:09.067 --> 36:12.438
I should be there
for insurance.

36:12.538 --> 36:15.607
There are a lot of ways
this can go south.

38:45.424 --> 38:47.158
Turn around.

41:30.656 --> 41:33.158
Today,
you are going to die.

41:35.326 --> 41:36.494
But.

41:36.595 --> 41:41.232
There are good deaths,
and there are bad deaths.

41:41.332 --> 41:44.402
Tell me
what I need to know --

41:44.502 --> 41:47.372
I'll see
that your death is a good one.

41:49.741 --> 41:52.544
Who put you
up to this?

42:02.253 --> 42:04.990
One last chance.

42:05.090 --> 42:06.692
Who?

42:27.278 --> 42:30.281
It was Alvarez.

42:30.381 --> 42:33.518
Los Odios,
out of Peru.

42:33.619 --> 42:37.188
They paid me
to set up your nephew.

42:37.288 --> 42:39.190
And I did.

43:00.011 --> 43:01.512
Alvarez, we know.

43:01.613 --> 43:02.881
Los Odios,
we know.

43:02.981 --> 43:05.216
Was anyone else
involved?

43:09.955 --> 43:11.923
Him?

43:12.023 --> 43:14.592
You think...
the Chicken Man?

43:18.697 --> 43:20.265
What a joke.

43:20.365 --> 43:23.935
Alvarez has been paying me
for years -- years.

43:24.035 --> 43:25.203
But you know what?

43:25.303 --> 43:26.705
I would've done it
for free,

43:26.805 --> 43:28.173
because I hate
every last one

43:28.273 --> 43:31.076
of you psycho
sacks of shit.

43:32.610 --> 43:34.579
I opened Lalo's gate.

43:34.680 --> 43:35.747
And I would
do it again.

43:35.847 --> 43:37.916
And I'm glad
what they did to him.

43:38.016 --> 43:39.718
He's a soulless pig.

43:39.818 --> 43:42.053
And I wish I'd killed him
with my own hands.

43:42.153 --> 43:44.956
And you know what else,
Hector?

43:45.056 --> 43:47.625
I put you
in that chair.

43:47.726 --> 43:50.261
Oh, yeah.
Your heart meds?

43:50.361 --> 43:53.131
I switched them
for sugar pills.

43:53.231 --> 43:54.700
You were
dead and buried,

43:54.800 --> 43:57.402
and I had to watch this asshole
bring you back.

43:57.502 --> 44:00.305
So when you are sitting
in your shitty nursing home

44:00.405 --> 44:02.273
and you're suckin' down
on your jello

44:02.373 --> 44:04.943
night after night
for the rest of your life,

44:05.043 --> 44:09.380
you think of me,
you twisted fuck!

44:09.480 --> 44:11.649
Es suyo.

44:24.730 --> 44:26.732
Do it.

46:15.673 --> 46:17.876
On the next episode of
"Better Call Saul"...

46:17.976 --> 46:21.379
You ever feel like
you're being followed?

46:21.479 --> 46:24.082
Who's here to see
Saul Goodman?

46:24.182 --> 46:26.084
You're the guy, right?

46:26.184 --> 46:28.386
I'm just getting
warmed up.

46:30.688 --> 46:33.258
What the hell is going on?

46:33.358 --> 46:35.226
It's just...wrong.

46:35.326 --> 46:37.428
I need guys
in close.

46:37.528 --> 46:41.266
Are. You.
Following me?
