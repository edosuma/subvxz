00:00.567 --> 00:02.300
IN CONCLUSION,

00:02.300 --> 00:04.233
SOME PRODUCTS
WE USE EVERY DAY

00:04.233 --> 00:06.000
CAUSE ALGAE
TO GROW IN LAKES...

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
CUTTING OFF OXYGEN AND
DISRUPTING THE ECOSYSTEM.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.734
SO...
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED

00:11.734 --> 00:14.500
IS THAT WE MUST CHOOSE
BIODEGRADABLE PRODUCTS

00:14.500 --> 00:17.100
TO HELP PROTECT
OUR ENVIRONMENT.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.100
EXCELLENT REPORT.

00:23.100 --> 00:26.100
INSPIRED VISUALS.
NEXT TEAM.

[CLEARS THROAT]

00:34.033 --> 00:37.400
HOW AIR POLLUTION AFFECTS
OUR EVERYDAY LIFE.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.133
EXCELLENT TOPIC.

00:40.767 --> 00:44.767
DENVER--HIGH ATOP
THE MAJESTIC ROCKY MOUNTAINS,

00:44.767 --> 00:47.400
ELEVATION--5,000 FEET.

00:47.400 --> 00:49.867
PHILADELPHIA--

00:49.867 --> 00:51.767
LYING LOW IN
THE DELAWARE BASIN

00:51.767 --> 00:53.767
250 FEET
ABOVE SEA LEVEL.

00:53.767 --> 00:54.834
WELL RESEARCHED.

00:54.834 --> 00:58.367
DENVER--CLEAN CRISP
MOUNTAIN AIR.

00:58.367 --> 01:00.800
PHILADELPHIA--

01:00.800 --> 01:03.033
POLLUTED
INDUSTRIAL SMOG.

01:03.033 --> 01:04.300
MILE HIGH STADIUM--

01:04.300 --> 01:06.700
HOME OF
THE COLORADO ROCKIES.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.300
VETERANS STADIUM--

01:08.300 --> 01:10.300
HOME OF THE
PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES.

01:10.300 --> 01:12.400
OH, HERE WE GO.

01:12.400 --> 01:15.767
THE ROCKIES, A BOGUS
EXPANSION TEAM MIND YOU,

01:15.767 --> 01:17.700
ARE AVERAGING
FOUR MORE RUNS PER GAME

01:17.700 --> 01:19.200
THAN ANYONE
IN THE LEAGUE

01:19.200 --> 01:21.200
BECAUSE OF
THEIR CLEAN AIR.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.233
OUR THEORY IS
IF PHILADELPHIA

01:23.233 --> 01:24.900
WOULD CLEAN UP
ITS SMOGGY AIR,

01:24.900 --> 01:27.000
THE BALL WOULD SLICE
THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE

01:27.000 --> 01:28.133
WITH A GREATER VELOCITY.

01:28.133 --> 01:30.700
THEREFORE THE PHILLIES
WOULD SCORE MORE RUNS.

01:30.700 --> 01:33.100
AND WIN
EVERY HOME GAME.

01:33.100 --> 01:34.734
THE END.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.800
SO, HOW'D YOU
LIKE OUR REPORT?

01:38.800 --> 01:40.100

01:40.100 --> 01:42.133
STINKS! HOW'D YOU
LIKE MY HALF?

01:44.900 --> 01:47.300
RELAX, MR. MATTHEWS.
I BLAME MYSELF.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.567
YOU DO?
COOL.

01:49.567 --> 01:52.200
YES. I LET YOU CHOOSE
YOUR OWN PARTNER.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.200
AN ASTOUNDING
LAPSE OF JUDGMENT

01:54.200 --> 01:57.100
FOR SOMEONE
OF MY EXPERIENCE.

01:57.100 --> 01:59.500
I'M GOING TO LET YOU
TRY AGAIN,

01:59.500 --> 02:01.934
BUT THIS TIME
I'LL CHOOSE THE TEAMS.

02:01.934 --> 02:04.033
MR. HUNTER,
YOU'LL WORK WITH MR. MINKUS.

02:04.033 --> 02:06.667
OH, NO.
OH, NO.

02:06.667 --> 02:08.000
AND MR. MATTHEWS--

02:08.000 --> 02:09.600
YEAH, I'LL HOOK UP
WITH MR. SULLIVAN.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.900
NO, NO. THAT'S WORSE.

02:11.900 --> 02:14.000
YOU'LL WORK WITH
MISS LAWRENCE.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
TOPANGA?

02:17.900 --> 02:20.233
GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

02:22.200 --> 02:23.200
WHY?

02:23.200 --> 02:26.000
I WANT TO SEE IF
OUR ENERGIES CONVERGE.

02:28.300 --> 02:29.400
OOH.

02:34.300 --> 02:36.200
HE'S VIBRATIONALLY
ACCEPTABLE.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
THANKS.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.500
UH, MR. FEENY,
MAY I APPROACH THE BENCH?

02:42.500 --> 02:44.100
OBJECTION,
MR. MATTHEWS?

02:44.100 --> 02:47.000
CAN YOU BE SWAYED
ON THIS?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.367
I'M GIBRALTAR.

02:49.367 --> 02:50.667
COME ON, MR. FEENY.

02:50.667 --> 02:53.300
TOPANGA'S, LIKE,
TOTALLY STRANGE.

02:53.300 --> 02:57.033
STRANGE IS IN THE EYE OF
THE BEHOLDER, MR. MATTHEWS.

02:57.033 --> 02:59.700
I, FOR EXAMPLE,
HAVE A YOUNG NEIGHBOR

02:59.700 --> 03:00.800
WHO SINGS ALONG WITH

03:00.800 --> 03:02.967
HIS LITTLE SISTER'S
BARNEY RECORDS.

03:07.367 --> 03:09.600
YOU HEAR THAT?

04:12.567 --> 04:14.467
WHY WOULD I WANT TO
INVITE HIM TO MY PARTY?

04:14.467 --> 04:15.000
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.033
HE'S GROSS.

04:16.033 --> 04:18.467
HE'S A TOTAL
BRILLO HEAD.

04:35.367 --> 04:36.500
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF MY HAIR?

04:38.967 --> 04:41.767
GUYS DON'T ASK GUYS
THAT QUESTION.

04:41.767 --> 04:45.400
WELL, WOULD THIS QUALIFY
AS A BRILLO HEAD?

04:45.400 --> 04:49.667
NAH. YOU'RE MORE
LIKE A NERF HEAD.

04:49.667 --> 04:52.667
YOU KNEW THIS,
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?

04:52.667 --> 04:54.734
YOU GOT CURLY HAIR.
BIG DEAL.

04:54.734 --> 04:55.800
CAN WE MOVE ON NOW?

04:55.800 --> 04:57.867
SURE. IT'S EASY
FOR YOU TO TALK.

04:57.867 --> 04:59.600
YOU GOT HAIR.
I'M A CHIA PET.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.967
CORY...

05:05.967 --> 05:09.300
I GOT JEDIDIAH TO DRIVE ME
TO YOUR HOUSE AFTER SCHOOL.

05:09.300 --> 05:11.000
WHO'S JEDIDIAH?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.467
MY FATHER.

05:12.467 --> 05:15.300
WAIT. YOU CALL
YOUR FATHER JEDIDIAH?

05:15.300 --> 05:17.400
THAT'S HIS NAME.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.200
WHAT DO YOU CALL
YOUR FATHER?

05:19.200 --> 05:21.300
WELL, LIKE A LOT
OF NORMAL PEOPLE,

05:21.300 --> 05:23.834
I REFER TO HIM AS "DAD."

05:23.834 --> 05:27.000
THEN HOW DO YOU TELL HIM APART
FROM ALL THE OTHER DADS?

05:29.767 --> 05:31.233
LOOK, TOPANGA,
IS THERE ANY WAY

05:31.233 --> 05:32.500
WE CAN DO
THIS ASSIGNMENT

05:32.500 --> 05:35.200
ON THE PHONE...
OR BY TELEPATHY?

05:35.200 --> 05:37.867
IT CONCERNS
OUR ENVIRONMENT.

05:37.867 --> 05:40.500
I THINK IT DESERVES
MORE DIRECT ATTENTION.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.300
OK, OK. I'LL SEE YOU AT
MY HOUSE AFTER SCHOOL.

05:43.300 --> 05:44.567
BEFORE I LEAVE,

05:44.567 --> 05:46.400
I'D LIKE YOU
TO SIGN A PETITION

05:46.400 --> 05:48.033
TO SAVE
MRS. ROSEMEAD'S JOB.

05:48.033 --> 05:49.934
WHO'S MRS. ROSEMEAD?

05:49.934 --> 05:52.233
OUR LIBRARIAN.

05:52.233 --> 05:54.567
THEY'RE FORCING HER
TO RETIRE.

05:54.567 --> 05:55.834
IT'S BLATANT AGEISM.

05:55.834 --> 05:59.600
MAYBE BECAUSE
SHE'S BLATANTLY OLD.

05:59.600 --> 06:02.033
LOOK, CAN WE TALK ABOUT
THIS LATER?

06:02.033 --> 06:03.100
WE'RE REAL, REAL BUSY HERE.

06:03.100 --> 06:05.867
FINE. I'LL RESPECT
YOUR SPACE.

06:08.867 --> 06:12.233
WOW. FEENY MUST REALLY
HATE YOUR GUTS.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.967
COULD BE WORSE.

06:15.967 --> 06:17.567
AT LEAST HE DIDN'T
GIVE ME MINKUS.

06:17.567 --> 06:20.000
HEY, MINKUS
DOESN'T LIKE ME,

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
HE DOESN'T TRUST ME,

06:21.000 --> 06:22.400
AND HE DOESN'T
RESPECT ME.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.767
SO HE'S DOING THE WHOLE
ASSIGNMENT BY HIMSELF.

06:24.767 --> 06:27.900
IN MY BOOK,
STUART MINKUS IS A GOD.

06:27.900 --> 06:30.667
THEN WHY IS HE SITTING
AT THE WEIRDO TABLE?

06:35.467 --> 06:37.567
IT'S LIKE THE CAST
OF <i>THE ADDAMS FAMILY. </i>

06:40.667 --> 06:43.133
DON'T THEY CARE
WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE?

06:43.133 --> 06:45.000
WHO CARES WHAT
THEY LOOK LIKE?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.500
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO
ABOUT MY HAIR?

06:47.500 --> 06:49.600
HEY, IF YOU'RE
THAT STRESSED OUT,

06:49.600 --> 06:50.900
I'LL ASK MY SISTER

06:50.900 --> 06:52.800
WHAT SHE USES TO
STRAIGHTEN HER HAIR.

06:52.800 --> 06:55.500
YOUR SISTER
STRAIGHTENS HER HAIR?

06:55.500 --> 06:58.400
YEAH. IF SHE DIDN'T,
IT'D LOOK AS BAD AS...

06:58.400 --> 07:00.300
OH, I DON'T KNOW, YOU.

07:05.900 --> 07:08.400
MOMMY,
IF MY DOLLY IS COLD,

07:08.400 --> 07:10.900
CAN I PUT HER
IN THE TOASTER OVEN?

07:13.100 --> 07:15.200
NO, HONEY.
THAT WOULD BE A MISTAKE.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.867
MOMMY?
WHAT?

07:16.867 --> 07:18.133
I MADE A MISTAKE.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.867
CORY, DIDN'T
YOU SMELL THAT?

07:23.867 --> 07:28.500
I JUST THOUGHT WE WERE
HAVING PLASTIC FOR DINNER.

07:31.100 --> 07:33.467
I DON'T CARE WHAT
SHE LOOKS LIKE.

07:33.467 --> 07:36.300
DEBBIE'S MY DOLL,
AND I LOVE HER.

07:36.300 --> 07:38.834
WELL, SWEETHEART,
WE'LL GET YOU ANOTHER DOLL.

07:38.834 --> 07:41.200
OK.

07:42.967 --> 07:43.900
SEE YOU LATER, AMY.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.834
AMY?

07:46.834 --> 07:48.033
OR IF
YOU PREFER, MOM.

07:49.467 --> 07:51.467
I TOLD YOU.

07:51.467 --> 07:54.233
I HAVE SOME IDEAS
ON OUR PRESENTATION.

07:54.233 --> 07:56.500
SO DO I.
HERE'S WHAT WE DO.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.900
WE HIT FEENY HARD.
WE HIT HIM FAST.

IT'S GOT A HOLE.

WE'RE IN, WE'RE OUT.

08:03.367 --> 08:06.500
I KIND OF HAD A WHOLE
DIFFERENT APPROACH

08:06.500 --> 08:07.500
TO THE REPORT.

08:07.500 --> 08:11.100
LESS CONVENTIONAL,
MORE PERFORMANCE ART.

08:11.100 --> 08:13.800
NO, PLEASE, LET'S STICK
TO CONVENTIONAL.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.600
CONVENTIONAL'S GOOD BECAUSE
NO ONE LAUGHS AT CONVENTIONAL.

08:19.100 --> 08:21.567
READ THIS POEM
OUT LOUD.

08:21.567 --> 08:23.667

WILL YOU JUST PLEASE

09:11.567 --> 09:13.667

AND HIT ME OVER THE HEAD?

09:16.400 --> 09:18.100

IT HAD MEANING?

TO DO WITH THAT.

WASHED IT OUT 45 MINUTES AGO.

TO DO WITH THIS.

12:26.834 --> 12:30.567
CORY, WHAT DID YOU DO
TO YOUR BEAUTIFUL HAIR?

12:30.567 --> 12:34.100
IT WASN'T BEAUTIFUL.
IT LOOKED LIKE VELCRO.

12:34.100 --> 12:37.700
NOTHING'S GOING TO STICK
TO THAT NOW, MAN.

12:37.700 --> 12:40.000
THIS IS YOUR FAULT.
YOU GOT THE GOOD HAIR.

THE SAME THING.

A LITTLE SHAMPOO MIGHT--

13:42.700 --> 13:43.934
NO. YOU SEE,

13:43.934 --> 13:45.233
THE WHOLE PRINCIPLE
BEHIND SHAMPOO

13:45.233 --> 13:47.100
IS THAT IT ACTUALLY
HAS TO TOUCH YOUR HAIR.

13:47.100 --> 13:48.300

TO SCHOOL WITH A CAPE.
