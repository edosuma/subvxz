01:01.901 --> 01:03.468
Mmm.

01:03.470 --> 01:05.405
Mmm.

01:07.575 --> 01:09.244
That looks good.

01:14.548 --> 01:16.818
It's a hot dog, yeah?

01:19.286 --> 01:20.621
Yeah.

01:22.390 --> 01:24.423
Man, I can't even...

01:24.425 --> 01:27.892
Can't even see the hot dog
in that hot dog, right?

01:43.878 --> 01:45.510
Hey.

01:45.512 --> 01:47.645
You know what
you want, hon?

01:47.647 --> 01:48.980
Um. Almost.

01:48.982 --> 01:50.448
Uh...

01:50.450 --> 01:52.383
It's been a while.

01:52.385 --> 01:53.751
Do you remember me?

01:53.753 --> 01:56.454
Well, I get a lot of people
in here, so...

01:56.456 --> 01:58.691
Right. Right.

01:58.693 --> 02:00.992
You look a little thinner
a couple of years ago?

02:00.994 --> 02:03.695
I kinda remember
a couple coming in here a lot.

02:03.697 --> 02:05.463
That was, um...

02:05.465 --> 02:07.031
That was my fiancée.
We used to...

02:07.033 --> 02:09.032
I don't think
I've gained weight, though.

02:09.035 --> 02:10.801
Maybe it
was someone else.

02:10.804 --> 02:14.406
My memory's
shot to shit, hon.

02:18.845 --> 02:21.712
Has it really been
that long?

02:21.714 --> 02:23.583
So are you waiting
for someone, or...?

02:25.319 --> 02:27.953
No, it's just me.

02:27.955 --> 02:30.955
<i>...when you
look down, and you realize</i>

02:30.957 --> 02:32.691
<i>there's no phone
in your pocket.</i>

02:32.693 --> 02:34.693
<i>That happens all the time.</i>

02:34.695 --> 02:36.461
<i>Right? Now, did you know</i>

02:36.463 --> 02:38.296
<i>that sensation
actually has a name?</i>

02:38.298 --> 02:40.664
<i>Scientists call it
phantom vibration.</i>

02:40.666 --> 02:42.967
<i>You feel like
your phone is vibrating,</i>

02:42.969 --> 02:45.336
<i>but it's actually not.
It's just your body...</i>

02:47.440 --> 02:50.609
<i>It's crazy. I didn't
know there was a name for that.</i>

02:50.611 --> 02:52.711
<i>Well, not only
is there a name...</i>

03:03.856 --> 03:06.624
<i>Boy, you really
lucked out tonight, Heather.</i>

03:06.626 --> 03:08.326
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

03:08.328 --> 03:09.860
<i>She had a good time.</i>

03:09.862 --> 03:14.098
<i>And I hope you did too.
We'll see you next time.</i>

03:22.542 --> 03:25.943
<i>Are you
searching for something?</i>

03:25.945 --> 03:29.848
<i>Is baggage
weighing you down?</i>

03:29.850 --> 03:33.418
<i>Wish you could restart?</i>

03:33.420 --> 03:35.620
<i>Well, now you can.</i>

03:35.622 --> 03:39.491
<i>And guess
how much it costs.</i>

03:39.493 --> 03:42.061
<i>Absolutely nothing.</i>

03:42.063 --> 03:44.695
<i>It's free.</i>

03:44.697 --> 03:49.099
<i>Join us on a retreat
to one of the most beautiful</i>

03:49.101 --> 03:52.471
<i>and remote places
in the country</i>

03:52.473 --> 03:55.140
<i>as you try
a brand-new program</i>

03:55.142 --> 03:58.710
<i>guaranteed to rid
the negative toxins</i>

03:58.712 --> 04:00.913
<i>from your life.</i>

04:00.915 --> 04:02.914
<i>Isn't it time?</i>

04:02.916 --> 04:07.019
<i>Visit LetsGetPure.com</i>

04:07.021 --> 04:11.125
<i>and face your demons today.</i>

04:42.889 --> 04:45.156
<i>Now, that's
what I like to see!</i>

04:45.158 --> 04:48.728
<i>Some of that good
St. Patrick's Day spirit!</i>

05:27.533 --> 05:32.471
Okay, everybody. Who's ready
to change their lives today?

05:32.473 --> 05:34.605
Good, because
if you're not ready,

05:34.607 --> 05:35.975
there's the door.

05:35.977 --> 05:37.612
Go on, you can leave
if you like.

05:49.756 --> 05:51.221
Okay.

05:51.223 --> 05:53.959
Now, you've all heard
of the lemon-cleanse diet.

05:53.961 --> 05:56.528
It was designed back
in the 1980s to help the body

05:56.530 --> 05:58.062
rid itself
of negative toxins.

05:58.064 --> 05:59.764
Those... Those things
that prevent

05:59.766 --> 06:01.667
the body
from doing its job.

06:01.669 --> 06:05.502
It originated with Ken Roberts
and his best-selling book,

06:05.504 --> 06:08.038
<i>The Purification
of the Lemon Cleanser.</i>

06:08.040 --> 06:11.509
The lemon cleanser has caught
on like wildfire in recent years.

06:11.511 --> 06:14.547
In fact, some of your favorite
celebrities have done it.

06:14.549 --> 06:18.619
But Mr. Roberts
felt he could do better.

06:20.953 --> 06:25.089
Now I want you all
to close your eyes and relax.

06:25.091 --> 06:27.959
Think about that pain
you felt.

06:27.961 --> 06:31.228
That deep pain
that prevents you

06:31.230 --> 06:34.098
from getting ahead in life.

06:34.100 --> 06:36.834
We need to know that pain.

06:36.836 --> 06:38.670
Keep thinking.

06:38.672 --> 06:40.906
Keep thinking.

06:40.908 --> 06:42.874
Keep thinking.

06:47.081 --> 06:48.913
And open.

06:54.653 --> 06:56.821
Now...

06:56.823 --> 07:00.126
who wants to share
their pain first?

07:05.799 --> 07:07.132
Yes, thank you.

07:07.134 --> 07:08.667
One sec, here we go.

07:08.669 --> 07:10.668
Oh, uh...

07:10.670 --> 07:13.637
Mr. Roberts just wants to get
a good look at you.

07:13.639 --> 07:15.342
Heh, heh.

07:17.877 --> 07:24.115
Uh. So, uh, this, uh,
one time, I...

07:24.117 --> 07:27.985
Uh, posted on Facebook
that my friend Darryl

07:27.987 --> 07:30.824
was a... A dick-licker.

07:31.792 --> 07:33.194
I guess I kind of feel

07:34.627 --> 07:36.928
bad about that.

07:36.930 --> 07:40.298
Is that what
you're looking for?

07:40.300 --> 07:43.235
He's actually...
He's actually not a dick-licker.

07:43.237 --> 07:44.972
Okay. Ha, ha.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.307
What's wrong?

07:48.309 --> 07:50.108
Come
on, I'm kidding.

07:50.110 --> 07:52.610
This shit is weird.

07:52.612 --> 07:56.047
Folks, it's...
It's really important that we...

07:56.049 --> 07:57.348
We dig deep here.

07:57.350 --> 07:59.817
You know,
your personal stories right now

07:59.819 --> 08:03.891
are what will help us determine
who goes on the retreat.

08:05.158 --> 08:07.792
Yes, in the back?

08:07.794 --> 08:09.263
One sec.

08:15.735 --> 08:18.403
Okay, hi, I'm Maggie.

08:18.405 --> 08:20.338
Um. Ahem.

08:20.340 --> 08:22.943
Yeah, I was married
for 10 years. Um...

08:24.177 --> 08:26.211
We got hitched
after high school.

08:26.213 --> 08:29.213
Uh. Yeah. My...
My husband wanted kids.

08:29.215 --> 08:31.451
Ah, I was against it.

08:34.188 --> 08:36.788
And then one day,
I came home and, um,

08:36.789 --> 08:42.193
he blew his... He blew
his brains out with a shotgun.

08:42.195 --> 08:44.294
And, um...

08:44.296 --> 08:47.698
That's all we need.
Thank you.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.768
- You can go ahead now, hon.
- Oh, not now.

08:49.770 --> 08:51.805
- Go on. Go ahead.
- I don't...

08:57.174 --> 08:57.811
Uh...

08:59.346 --> 09:01.947
I'm-I'm Paul Berger.

09:01.949 --> 09:05.783
I guess I don't know
if I have a lot of pain.

09:05.785 --> 09:09.120
I mean, we all have bad days
once in a while, right?

09:09.122 --> 09:12.157
Um, I recently lost my job.

09:12.159 --> 09:15.326
I was engaged for a long time,
that didn't work out. What else?

09:15.328 --> 09:17.129
Um, I'm from New Jersey,

09:17.131 --> 09:19.297
which I know
what you're all thinking,

09:19.299 --> 09:22.133
but New Jersey, it's...
It's actually a great place.

09:22.135 --> 09:24.836
Have any of you heard of
a town called Newfield?

09:24.838 --> 09:26.404
Well, it's a borough,
actually.

09:26.406 --> 09:28.441
It was established
in 1924.

09:30.010 --> 09:32.076
Have you ever
cleansed before?

09:32.078 --> 09:33.076
Oh, no,
thank you.

09:33.078 --> 09:34.446
I like
my sandwiches.

09:34.448 --> 09:36.715
Yeah, I hear you.

09:36.717 --> 09:39.418
I'm gonna miss
hot dogs.

09:39.420 --> 09:42.086
This sounds real interesting,
though, don't it?

09:42.088 --> 09:46.291
The idea of getting pure,
restarting your life?

09:46.293 --> 09:48.025
- Keep pressure on that.
- Yeah.

09:49.862 --> 09:52.864
When will I know
if they pick me?

09:52.866 --> 09:54.869
They'll call you
today.

09:58.237 --> 09:59.806
Pee in this cup.

10:05.112 --> 10:06.977
Sorry, I didn't mean...

10:08.949 --> 10:10.480
Hi, I'm Paul Berger.

10:10.482 --> 10:12.417
Yeah, I know.

10:12.419 --> 10:16.122
Hey, I just wanted to say that
that was really brave of you.

10:17.089 --> 10:18.191
What was?

10:19.126 --> 10:20.826
What you just said in...

10:20.828 --> 10:22.860
I'm sorry
about your husband.

10:22.862 --> 10:24.828
I-I-I can't believe
you had to see that.

10:24.830 --> 10:26.163
That must
have been terrible.

10:26.165 --> 10:28.068
Yeah, um...

10:29.868 --> 10:31.036
I made that up.

10:31.038 --> 10:33.004
What?

10:33.006 --> 10:35.206
Well, didn't
you make yours up too?

10:35.208 --> 10:37.174
I guess the way
you kept, you know,

10:37.176 --> 10:39.277
going on
and on and on, you...

10:39.279 --> 10:40.945
Oh, yeah. No.

10:40.947 --> 10:42.480
I made mine up too.

10:42.482 --> 10:44.849
Oh, I, uh,

10:44.851 --> 10:46.116
gotta get that.

10:46.118 --> 10:47.519
Okay, yeah. Sure.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.187
Hey.

10:49.189 --> 10:51.522
I... I hope you
get the call today.

10:51.524 --> 10:54.491
Maybe I'll see you
there, huh?

10:54.493 --> 10:56.495
All right,
I'll see you around.

10:58.798 --> 11:01.198
<i>Hello, this is Ken Roberts.</i>

11:01.200 --> 11:03.268
<i>Thank you for
purchasing my book.</i>

11:03.270 --> 11:05.903
<i>Although it was
first published in the 1980s,</i>

11:05.905 --> 11:08.405
<i>you'll find that a lot
of my current principles</i>

11:08.407 --> 11:11.442
<i>actually originated
in this early text.</i>

11:11.444 --> 11:13.144
<i>So thank you for listening.</i>

11:13.146 --> 11:14.879
<i>Chapter 1.</i>

11:14.881 --> 11:18.383
<i>Since the days of Jesus Christ,
who fasted for 40 days,</i>

11:18.385 --> 11:22.352
<i>men and women have abstained
from food for many reasons.</i>

11:22.354 --> 11:23.855
<i>For health...</i>

11:23.857 --> 11:25.456
<i>...political ends...</i>

11:25.458 --> 11:28.024
Oh. Oh, no.

11:28.026 --> 11:30.528
Hey, uh, Zatik?

11:30.530 --> 11:33.130
Uh-huh. Yeah, hi.
Could you come over, please?

11:33.132 --> 11:36.500
I have a bit
of a rat situation.

11:36.502 --> 11:38.169
I know you're
watching the game,

11:38.171 --> 11:40.205
but if you could
just come over for...

11:42.175 --> 11:43.908
One sec.

11:43.910 --> 11:47.077
Sorry. Hello?

11:47.079 --> 11:50.548
<i>Hello, am I
speaking with Paul Berger?</i>

11:50.550 --> 11:52.383
Uh, Yeah.

11:52.385 --> 11:54.451
<i>Oh, good. I'm
so glad I caught you.</i>

11:54.453 --> 11:56.922
<i>I'm calling on behalf
of the Roberts Institute.</i>

11:56.924 --> 11:58.389
Oh, hi.

11:58.391 --> 12:00.091
<i>Did we reach
you at a bad time?</i>

12:00.093 --> 12:02.894
No, no. This is a great time.

12:02.896 --> 12:04.861
Berger!

12:04.863 --> 12:06.199
<i>Are you still there?</i>

12:07.400 --> 12:08.398
Rat.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.168
Oh, thank you. Sorry.

12:10.170 --> 12:11.937
<i>Are you sure
this is a good time?</i>

12:11.939 --> 12:13.171
Uh-huh.

12:13.173 --> 12:14.438
<i>Well, we have good news.</i>

12:14.440 --> 12:16.307
You do? Okay.

12:16.309 --> 12:18.275
<i>We'd love for you to join Mr.
Roberts.</i>

12:18.277 --> 12:20.043
Really?

12:20.045 --> 12:21.645
<i>You have some
paperwork to sign,</i>

12:21.647 --> 12:23.648
<i>and they'll have
someone pick you up tonight.</i>

12:23.650 --> 12:25.116
Okay.

12:25.118 --> 12:27.051
<i>Great. Enjoy your retreat.</i>

12:27.053 --> 12:28.519
Okay, great.

12:30.156 --> 12:31.557
Got him.

12:48.974 --> 12:50.575
"Death"?

13:42.161 --> 13:43.730
Um, hi.

13:45.231 --> 13:48.164
Are you with
the Roberts Institute?

14:07.352 --> 14:09.555
Oh.

14:43.390 --> 14:44.824
Hm?

14:55.135 --> 14:56.667
Welcome.

14:56.669 --> 14:57.737
How was the ride?

14:58.737 --> 15:00.339
It was good.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.445
Hi, I'm-I'm
Paul Berger.

15:06.447 --> 15:09.714
Hi, Paul Berger.
I'm Fredericks.

15:09.716 --> 15:12.551
Hello, Fredericks.

15:14.319 --> 15:15.519
Let me get your bags.

15:15.521 --> 15:17.090
Thank you.

15:26.833 --> 15:28.102
Hey.

15:29.435 --> 15:32.305
That's...
You got in too? That's...

15:33.439 --> 15:35.273
...so crazy.

15:35.275 --> 15:36.773
Yeah.

15:38.811 --> 15:40.544
Oh! Oh, I'll get that.

15:40.546 --> 15:42.115
Yeah. Heh.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.485
You packed a lot.

15:48.487 --> 15:50.589
Jesus,
you're like a girl.

15:50.591 --> 15:51.525
Phew.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.626
Someone got you good
there, huh?

15:55.628 --> 15:58.596
- Huh?
- The... You...

15:58.598 --> 15:59.830
Oh, they sure did.

15:59.832 --> 16:02.166
My uncle had a cat,

16:02.168 --> 16:03.533
used to scratch him
like that.

16:03.535 --> 16:05.736
They can get real ornery, huh?
You have a cat?

16:05.738 --> 16:08.274
Yeah, I have a cat.

16:09.642 --> 16:13.177
I'll show you where
orientation is on the map.

16:13.179 --> 16:15.245
Follow me.

16:15.247 --> 16:17.751
I'll get you guys
settled in, huh?

16:18.885 --> 16:20.317
Let me take that
for you.

16:20.319 --> 16:21.552
Oh, it's okay.
I got it.

16:21.554 --> 16:24.458
- No, please. I insist.
- I... I got...

16:25.791 --> 16:27.624
Could you put that
under my...?

16:27.626 --> 16:29.793
- That's it.
- You okay?

16:29.795 --> 16:31.596
Uh-huh.

16:34.300 --> 16:35.835
Come on,
you guys.

16:45.678 --> 16:49.245
So are-are you
an actress?

16:49.247 --> 16:51.316
Yeah, I-I used to be.

16:51.318 --> 16:53.283
Yeah.

16:53.285 --> 16:55.720
Your photo here looks
like one of those headshots.

16:55.722 --> 16:57.424
It's an old one.

17:01.694 --> 17:02.795
Gotcha.

17:04.664 --> 17:07.364
Boy, it's been a long time
since I've seen the water.

17:07.366 --> 17:08.499
Hey-o.

17:08.501 --> 17:11.367
What's up, Jersey?

17:11.369 --> 17:13.569
They picked him
off that dick-licker story?

17:13.571 --> 17:14.941
Heh, heh.

17:16.540 --> 17:18.809
- What's up, man? Hey.
- Hey.

17:18.810 --> 17:20.810
So, uh, check this out.

17:20.813 --> 17:23.548
She really wanted
to come here, right?

17:23.550 --> 17:27.250
- And I'm... I'm trying to be a good dude...
- Sure.

17:27.252 --> 17:29.921
but what the fuck
was up with that contract?

17:29.923 --> 17:31.955
Kind of freaked me
the fuck out.

17:31.957 --> 17:34.624
Yeah, no, it did
that to me too, but...

17:58.451 --> 17:59.650
Come on, let it out.

17:59.652 --> 18:00.852
What?

18:00.854 --> 18:03.788
Let it out, out, out!

18:12.799 --> 18:15.767
It feels good to get
that out, doesn't it?

18:15.769 --> 18:18.635
Mmm. Thank you so much.

18:18.637 --> 18:21.338
And welcome.
My name is Lily.

18:21.340 --> 18:23.974
Now, I know you must be
starving from your trip

18:23.976 --> 18:26.344
so let's get started
right away.

18:26.346 --> 18:30.882
Fredericks is handing each
of you your own cleansing kit.

18:30.884 --> 18:33.483
Each kit contains
four drinks,

18:33.485 --> 18:36.319
which you must consume
by the end of the day.

18:36.321 --> 18:38.388
Now, each of these drinks

18:38.390 --> 18:41.325
is specifically
formulated for each of you,

18:41.327 --> 18:44.295
so don't drink anyone else's
by mistake.

18:44.297 --> 18:46.830
After you've completed
your four-course cleanse

18:46.832 --> 18:49.366
you'll find additional
nutritional supplement

18:49.368 --> 18:51.903
in your cabinets
for the rest of your stay.

18:51.905 --> 18:55.642
No outside food.
It's prohibited.

18:59.311 --> 19:00.611
Oh, whoa.

19:02.348 --> 19:04.848
That tastes
like an asshole.

19:04.850 --> 19:08.385
What? Baby, I thought
you said this is about

19:08.387 --> 19:10.320
being open,
being honest, right?

19:10.322 --> 19:12.522
Getting rid of all
the bad stuff, right?

19:12.524 --> 19:13.824
Yes, it is, Eric.

19:13.826 --> 19:15.992
And thank you
for your candor.

19:15.994 --> 19:19.463
But you must know that
these drinks are very powerful,

19:19.465 --> 19:22.365
and while they may seem
like a bitter pill to swallow,

19:22.367 --> 19:25.769
I can assure you that
I completed the course myself.

19:25.771 --> 19:30.441
And the anxiety
and sadness that I felt

19:30.443 --> 19:34.045
was replaced by...

19:34.047 --> 19:38.819
humility, a clear mind
and an open heart.

19:43.422 --> 19:46.660
Good. Good, Paul. Good.

19:53.398 --> 19:54.865
Fuck.

19:54.867 --> 19:57.602
Fredericks here has been
cleansing for some time too.

19:57.604 --> 20:01.638
We're hoping he completes
the course with all of you.

20:01.640 --> 20:04.877
And now,
without further ado...

20:05.811 --> 20:07.510
a message

20:07.512 --> 20:09.582
from Ken Roberts.

20:12.085 --> 20:14.352
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

20:14.354 --> 20:17.721
<i>Congratulations on being
one of the chosen few</i>

20:17.723 --> 20:19.891
<i>to take part in this retreat.</i>

20:19.893 --> 20:21.893
<i>I'd also like
to say thank you.</i>

20:21.895 --> 20:24.996
<i>It takes great courage
to do this.</i>

20:26.599 --> 20:28.699
<i>It is not easy
to put yourself out there.</i>

20:28.701 --> 20:30.433
<i>To... To risk judgment.</i>

20:30.435 --> 20:33.471
<i>It's one of the hardest,
but most important,</i>

20:33.473 --> 20:35.373
<i>things that we can do.</i>

20:35.375 --> 20:38.643
<i>We all have our baggage, folks.
It's part of being human.</i>

20:38.645 --> 20:42.613
<i>And letting it go
can be scary.</i>

20:42.615 --> 20:45.481
<i>And confusing.</i>

20:45.483 --> 20:47.550
<i>And what makes it
so confusing is that,</i>

20:47.552 --> 20:50.086
<i>over time, well, we've actually
come to depend on it.</i>

20:50.088 --> 20:52.890
<i>It's become familiar to us.</i>

20:52.892 --> 20:55.425
<i>Like a best friend
to get us through the day</i>

20:55.427 --> 20:56.994
<i>or a stuffed animal that...</i>

20:56.996 --> 21:00.064
<i>That keeps us cozy at night,
and we cling to it</i>

21:00.066 --> 21:01.798
<i>because we don't know
any better.</i>

21:01.800 --> 21:05.869
<i>Especially when we're scared.</i>

21:05.871 --> 21:10.508
<i>Now, the cleansing process
here won't be easy.</i>

21:10.510 --> 21:12.176
<i>But we are
extraordinarily proud</i>

21:12.178 --> 21:14.111
<i>of the system
we've created,</i>

21:14.113 --> 21:17.647
<i>and so excited to take part
in this next step with you.</i>

21:17.649 --> 21:22.752
<i>But you'll need to find
that inner strength.</i>

21:22.754 --> 21:24.855
<i>It's over to you now.</i>

21:24.857 --> 21:26.589
<i>I know you all have it,</i>

21:26.591 --> 21:28.826
<i>and I'm so looking forward
to meeting you all</i>

21:28.828 --> 21:30.864
<i>in the next few days.</i>

21:32.432 --> 21:35.836
<i>Let's get pure.</i>

21:55.588 --> 21:58.521
Last one.

22:19.544 --> 22:21.711
Stupid.
Fucking stupid. Stupid.

22:21.713 --> 22:24.149
Fucking,
fucking stupid.

22:33.091 --> 22:34.194
Did I spook you, babe?

22:35.226 --> 22:37.260
Yeah.

22:37.262 --> 22:38.862
Sorry.

22:42.001 --> 22:45.001
So Lily and Fredericks
are weird as hell, huh?

22:45.003 --> 22:47.805
You sure you did your research
on this place?

22:47.807 --> 22:50.807
Ken Roberts
has helped a lot of people.

22:50.809 --> 22:53.911
And... couples.

22:53.913 --> 22:55.546
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

22:55.548 --> 22:58.583
Okay, well, I-I-I still
don't understand why

22:58.585 --> 23:00.917
we need help,
but, uh, okay.

23:07.659 --> 23:09.826
You finished
all of yours?

23:09.828 --> 23:11.164
Yup.

23:14.666 --> 23:17.268
Here.
What you do is...

23:17.270 --> 23:19.068
You ready?
Grab your nose,

23:19.070 --> 23:21.538
and pinch it,

23:21.540 --> 23:23.540
and then take a sip,

23:23.542 --> 23:24.677
and it should help.

23:31.684 --> 23:33.183
That was hot.

23:33.185 --> 23:34.184
Shut up.

23:36.789 --> 23:38.955
Okay, so...

23:38.957 --> 23:41.659
What is this thing?
What are...? What are we doing?

23:41.661 --> 23:43.627
Are we supposed to...?

23:43.629 --> 23:47.964
We do this, we leave here,
and we-we feel different, right?

23:47.966 --> 23:50.834
We feel enlightened,
is that the deal?

23:50.836 --> 23:52.305
Mm-hm.

23:53.838 --> 23:56.342
I guess enlightenment
could be rad.

24:01.746 --> 24:03.980
Want a nightcap?

24:03.982 --> 24:06.784
Come on, don't...
Don't look at me like that.

24:06.786 --> 24:09.756
You're acting like
I'm an alcoholic or some shit.

24:17.664 --> 24:18.863
No.

24:27.639 --> 24:29.274
Oh.

25:34.772 --> 25:36.943
This is it?

25:45.917 --> 25:47.384
Come on, Paul.

26:17.716 --> 26:19.149
<i>I know it's exhausting,</i>

26:19.151 --> 26:21.919
but you should take
great pride in the fact

26:21.921 --> 26:23.488
that you've completed
your cleanse,

26:23.490 --> 26:27.057
and that you're moving on
to the elimination process.

26:27.059 --> 26:30.926
Right. Q-question. When you say
"elimination process," you...

26:30.928 --> 26:33.263
You mean, like...

26:34.899 --> 26:38.434
Heh, heh, right? 'Cause
I was doing a lot of that

26:38.436 --> 26:42.173
last night, and a lot coming out
the other end too.

26:42.175 --> 26:43.840
Yes, Eric.

26:43.842 --> 26:46.509
That is part of
the elimination process.

26:46.511 --> 26:49.747
And, of course, the next stage
will be termination,

26:49.749 --> 26:52.348
and after that,
you're gonna feel wonderful.

26:52.350 --> 26:56.354
Well, I already feel
good as hell, so, heh-heh-heh.

26:56.356 --> 26:58.087
That's interesting, Eric.

26:58.089 --> 27:00.990
Most people feel worse
before they feel better.

27:00.992 --> 27:04.961
Laurie has been having
some trouble with her cleanse,

27:04.963 --> 27:08.030
but I have faith
that, in her absence,

27:08.032 --> 27:10.366
she'll be able
to focus and complete.

27:10.368 --> 27:11.835
Yeah.

27:11.837 --> 27:14.037
No, Laurie'll be good.

27:14.039 --> 27:15.175
Fredericks?

27:17.109 --> 27:20.112
And now,
I'd like you to...

27:21.481 --> 27:24.948
...stare into
each other's eyes.

27:40.331 --> 27:42.865
It's hard, isn't it?

27:42.867 --> 27:46.037
Hard to look into
somebody else's eyes.

27:46.039 --> 27:50.307
I want you all to remember
how hard this is,

27:50.309 --> 27:53.410
because once you move
into the termination process,

27:53.412 --> 27:56.480
once you finish this,

27:56.482 --> 28:00.217
you'll finally be able to stare
into someone's eyes

28:00.219 --> 28:03.556
in a real, meaningful way.

28:05.224 --> 28:08.394
And it will be
a beautiful thing.

29:27.373 --> 29:29.943
Oh, my... Oh, my God.

29:34.512 --> 29:36.616
What the heck is that?

30:32.003 --> 30:33.336
Okay.

30:48.552 --> 30:49.688
Can I talk to Ken?

30:51.257 --> 30:52.422
He'll be here
tomorrow.

30:52.424 --> 30:54.990
He's not...? He'll... When?

30:54.992 --> 30:56.229
Oh, this is just...

30:58.297 --> 30:59.429
You seem upset.

30:59.431 --> 31:03.036
Uh... Something...

31:05.203 --> 31:07.304
came out of me,

31:07.306 --> 31:08.404
I think.

31:08.406 --> 31:10.274
That's perfectly normal.

31:10.276 --> 31:12.710
All of your questions
will be answered

31:12.712 --> 31:15.144
once Ken gets here.

31:45.743 --> 31:47.644
What am I supposed
to do with you?

32:26.385 --> 32:27.787
Right.

33:00.286 --> 33:01.687
Okay.

34:49.327 --> 34:50.463
Hmm?

34:51.562 --> 34:53.496
I... You...

34:53.498 --> 34:57.433
You were running pretty hard
out there, and then...

34:57.435 --> 34:59.002
you just fell over.

34:59.004 --> 35:01.270
So I brought you
back to your cabin.

35:01.272 --> 35:03.741
Thanks.

35:03.743 --> 35:05.808
Yeah. You probably
shouldn't be exercising

35:05.810 --> 35:07.810
when you're cleansing.

35:07.812 --> 35:09.747
You could hurt yourself.

35:09.749 --> 35:11.948
I read that.
I read it in Ken's book.

35:11.950 --> 35:14.852
We're supposed to limit
physical activity.

35:14.854 --> 35:16.453
Look, um,
I appreciate you

35:16.455 --> 35:18.388
bringing me back
to my cabin, but I'm...

35:18.390 --> 35:19.823
Oh.

35:19.825 --> 35:21.761
...good now.

35:22.794 --> 35:25.428
- Thanks.
- Okay.

35:26.631 --> 35:28.263
Yeah.

35:36.908 --> 35:38.375
What the hell is that?

35:38.377 --> 35:39.779
You haven't seen your...?

35:43.015 --> 35:44.480
Are you sure you're ready?

35:44.482 --> 35:46.283
I know it's weird
at first, but I...

35:46.285 --> 35:49.019
I kind of like mine now,
and if you think about it,

35:49.021 --> 35:50.620
it's kind of amazing...

35:50.622 --> 35:52.321
Just open it up, Paul.

35:58.531 --> 36:00.763
Oh, my God.

36:00.765 --> 36:02.401
It's okay.

36:03.868 --> 36:05.602
Fuck this.

36:05.604 --> 36:06.806
Hey.

36:12.377 --> 36:14.678
Well, I don't think
you should leave.

36:14.680 --> 36:17.446
And... And don't you wanna
meet Ken Roberts?

36:17.448 --> 36:19.415
Lily said he's coming
tomorrow.

36:19.417 --> 36:21.017
Are you for real
right now?

36:21.019 --> 36:22.722
Yeah, why?

36:24.055 --> 36:25.821
You expect me
to stay around

36:25.823 --> 36:28.323
after that thing
came out of me?

36:28.325 --> 36:29.325
Yeah.

36:36.434 --> 36:37.968
Maggie, you can't leave.

36:37.970 --> 36:40.604
Where are you going?

36:40.606 --> 36:43.109
If you have concerns,
you can always speak to me.

36:44.475 --> 36:46.843
No one told us
about those things.

36:46.845 --> 36:48.812
- Maggie...
- I didn't sign up for this shit.

36:48.814 --> 36:51.415
I want you to know
it's perfectly normal

36:51.417 --> 36:53.515
to have a hard time with this.

36:53.517 --> 36:56.722
But you are exactly
where you need to be.

37:13.705 --> 37:15.141
You all right?

37:21.646 --> 37:22.879
What's up? You okay?

37:22.881 --> 37:24.116
What do you need?

37:26.850 --> 37:29.118
Want a little bit?

37:29.120 --> 37:31.587
What, you thirsty
too, brosef?

37:31.589 --> 37:32.758
Huh?

37:36.495 --> 37:40.065
You're a thirsty
little turd, huh?

37:41.867 --> 37:44.933
Thirsty little turd.

37:50.908 --> 37:55.079
You're like a little me,
aren't you?

38:50.035 --> 38:51.136
Hi, Paul.

38:52.803 --> 38:54.236
Hey, I...
What happened?

38:54.238 --> 38:56.906
It's okay, Paul.

38:56.908 --> 38:58.640
I'm okay.

39:11.022 --> 39:14.124
No, please...
Please don't go. Please.

39:14.126 --> 39:16.662
I know. I know,
I'm so embarrassed.

39:17.995 --> 39:21.263
It's so disgusting
that came out of me.

39:21.265 --> 39:22.665
That came out of you?

39:22.667 --> 39:25.538
It was smaller
at first. Yeah.

39:27.604 --> 39:32.075
You know, I bet you hold
onto things too, huh?

39:32.077 --> 39:35.979
I mean, I bet you and I are
a lot alike, aren't we, Paul?

39:35.981 --> 39:38.017
I don't really
know you, really, so...

39:39.249 --> 39:41.084
I'm so pathetic.

39:41.086 --> 39:42.886
Oh, God.

39:42.888 --> 39:49.024
I trapped him down there because
I didn't have the heart...

39:49.026 --> 39:50.593
Should I get Lily for you?

39:50.595 --> 39:51.828
No.

39:55.232 --> 39:57.968
I have to do
this on my own.

40:23.894 --> 40:25.729
What the...?

40:25.731 --> 40:27.933
How come I don't...?

40:37.609 --> 40:39.575
Hey. Um...

40:39.577 --> 40:42.310
I don't know what to do.
Can you help me?

40:42.312 --> 40:44.279
It just keeps crying,
and if I go to it,

40:44.281 --> 40:48.250
it just hides, and then
it cries again and...

40:48.252 --> 40:50.819
It's... It's
driving me insane.

40:50.821 --> 40:52.055
Okay.

40:55.660 --> 40:58.796
It got bigger too.

41:01.300 --> 41:04.234
All right.
Come here, little guy.

41:04.236 --> 41:07.169
Or girl.

41:07.171 --> 41:09.841
I'm not... I won't
hurt you, I swear.

41:16.948 --> 41:18.350
Hey.

41:20.051 --> 41:22.352
Hm.

41:22.354 --> 41:26.957
Well, luckily, I brought over
a secret weapon.

41:26.959 --> 41:29.926
- Nuddy Budders?
- Oh, you like them too?

41:29.928 --> 41:33.296
- No, they're loaded with crap.
- Yeah. It's...

41:33.298 --> 41:35.832
This... It was in my bag
from an old trip.

41:35.834 --> 41:39.705
I didn't bring this on purpose.
I'm not... I'm not cheating.

41:41.106 --> 41:44.973
My thing loves this stuff.

41:48.046 --> 41:49.812
Go on.

41:49.814 --> 41:51.147
Come on.

41:58.923 --> 42:00.355
Hm.

42:10.801 --> 42:12.070
It's got teeth.

42:13.205 --> 42:15.205
Yours has got teeth.

42:15.207 --> 42:18.210
Yeah, he's teething.
I guess.

42:42.033 --> 42:44.002
No, what are you doing?

42:46.470 --> 42:49.107
Paul, I... I don't think
they should...

42:50.707 --> 42:51.910
...get that close.

43:08.059 --> 43:12.095
Sorry, it's just, they
were calling out for each other.

43:19.071 --> 43:21.206
You haven't picked yours up yet,
have you?

43:35.053 --> 43:37.256
It's not that bad, really.

43:40.292 --> 43:42.357
It's just kind of like...

43:42.359 --> 43:44.495
...weird butterballs.

43:53.805 --> 43:55.207
This is so strange.

43:56.841 --> 43:59.044
It's not that strange.

44:00.477 --> 44:03.182
They did come out of us
after all, right?

44:17.294 --> 44:19.162
Hello?

44:21.198 --> 44:23.066
Yeah, babe.

44:30.575 --> 44:33.145
Look, hey. Did you
drink your, uh...

44:34.345 --> 44:36.011
...your last drink?

44:36.013 --> 44:37.149
Huh?

44:38.816 --> 44:40.319
Never mind.

44:41.986 --> 44:44.821
Oh, yeah.

44:44.823 --> 44:46.488
What are you doing?

44:46.490 --> 44:51.060
I... I was gonna try to finish,

44:51.062 --> 44:53.897
but they're too gross.
I just can't drink them.

44:53.899 --> 44:56.933
Can you
just shut up for a second?

44:56.935 --> 44:58.968
Just stop talking, please.

44:58.970 --> 45:01.870
You're, like, giving me
a migraine.

45:01.872 --> 45:03.339
Sorry.

45:03.341 --> 45:05.140
It's fine. Why
are you apologizing?

45:05.142 --> 45:06.444
Sorry.

45:13.852 --> 45:18.156
You haven't eliminated once on
this entire retreat, have you?

45:19.390 --> 45:21.256
- Eliminated?
- I must have...

45:21.258 --> 45:22.859
I must have
thrown up and shit

45:22.861 --> 45:25.361
like 20 times
up on that mountaintop.

45:25.363 --> 45:30.102
You wouldn't believe...
what came out of me.

45:32.970 --> 45:35.437
Okay.

45:35.439 --> 45:37.607
It's starting to make
a lot of sense,

45:37.609 --> 45:39.875
what they're doing here,
Laurie.

45:39.877 --> 45:41.544
Like, I feel...

45:43.948 --> 45:46.982
...different. I feel good.

45:46.984 --> 45:49.618
Even those drinks
taste great to me now.

45:49.620 --> 45:51.323
- Really?
- Yup.

45:54.258 --> 45:57.660
You would know
if you finished your cleanse.

45:57.662 --> 46:01.096
How can I finish
if you drank them all?

46:01.098 --> 46:03.232
You're just jealous.
Stop being jealous.

46:03.234 --> 46:04.536
Jealous?

46:06.004 --> 46:08.507
We came out here
to fix you, Eric.

46:13.443 --> 46:15.279
What's that noise?

46:17.515 --> 46:19.013
Shit.

46:19.015 --> 46:21.116
- Eric?
- Oh, shit. Hey!

46:21.118 --> 46:22.651
- No, no, no.
- Eric.

46:22.653 --> 46:24.921
Hey, what are you doing?

46:24.923 --> 46:26.921
Please, stop it!

46:26.923 --> 46:28.256
Get your hand out of...

46:28.258 --> 46:30.259
No, don't
do that. Why...?

46:30.261 --> 46:32.461
Why are you eating
your hand? Don't...

46:32.463 --> 46:34.566
Why are you
eating yourself?

46:49.479 --> 46:51.613
- That's crazy, look.
- Hm?

46:51.615 --> 46:53.249
Well, he's...

46:53.251 --> 46:56.319
...doing that, you know,
knuckle thing that you do.

46:56.321 --> 46:57.656
Really?

47:02.327 --> 47:03.462
Heh.

47:05.095 --> 47:06.395
Heh.

47:06.397 --> 47:08.497
Yours does the thing
that you do too.

47:08.499 --> 47:13.336
The weird lip-twitch thing.

47:13.338 --> 47:15.303
Not weird.

47:15.305 --> 47:19.508
I didn't... We all have
our things, right?

47:31.488 --> 47:33.691
So, what do you
do for fun?

47:34.758 --> 47:36.591
Really? You wanna...

47:36.593 --> 47:38.597
...get to know me,
like...

47:39.664 --> 47:41.397
...right now?

47:41.399 --> 47:43.531
Well, I mean,
they're calm now.

47:43.533 --> 47:45.767
I mean, yeah. Yeah.

47:45.769 --> 47:48.370
I figured, you know,

47:48.372 --> 47:50.638
we can finally talk.

47:50.640 --> 47:52.107
Okay.

47:52.109 --> 47:54.544
The acting thing,
are you still doing that?

47:56.615 --> 47:59.714
I'm sorry, I really don't
wanna talk about that.

47:59.716 --> 48:01.383
Okay.

48:01.385 --> 48:03.252
Yeah.

48:03.254 --> 48:05.522
If you'd like to know
what I used to do

48:05.524 --> 48:09.725
for a living,
I could tell you.

48:09.727 --> 48:13.562
Well, I worked for this start-up
called Buzzy Brain.

48:13.564 --> 48:16.066
It's... It's a huge
software company,

48:16.068 --> 48:18.234
and I was there
from the beginning,

48:18.236 --> 48:20.102
ever since It's Monkey Time.

48:20.104 --> 48:21.537
It's Monkey Time?

48:21.539 --> 48:24.272
Oh, it was one
of our first apps.

48:24.274 --> 48:26.375
If you had a kid,
you would know it.

48:26.377 --> 48:30.078
The kids went nuts for it.

48:30.080 --> 48:31.747
It was a good job.

48:31.749 --> 48:32.781
It really was.

48:32.783 --> 48:33.752
And what happened?

48:35.086 --> 48:36.785
With It's Monkey Time?

48:36.787 --> 48:38.087
With your job.

48:38.089 --> 48:39.324
Well...

48:41.225 --> 48:43.093
That was... It kind of...

48:43.095 --> 48:45.227
Around the same time
as the whole...

48:45.229 --> 48:49.365
fiancée-stood-me-up-
at-the-altar incident and... I--

48:51.169 --> 48:53.468
Let's not talk
about my old job.

48:53.470 --> 48:56.538
I know you don't wanna talk
about it, the acting thing,

48:56.540 --> 49:01.410
but I think it's great that you
have dreams you wanna pursue.

49:01.412 --> 49:02.745
No, it's not.

49:02.747 --> 49:04.712
It's the worst thing
in the world.

49:04.714 --> 49:06.350
You just
end up getting...

49:07.618 --> 49:10.252
...disappointed.

49:12.457 --> 49:16.258
I wish I was like you.
I wish I had no dreams at all.

49:16.260 --> 49:19.497
I didn't say
I have no dreams. I...

49:22.167 --> 49:23.432
I have dreams.

49:34.245 --> 49:36.111
Jeez.

49:36.113 --> 49:37.613
Hey, hey.

49:37.615 --> 49:39.881
Chill out, buddy.

49:39.883 --> 49:42.651
There you go.
Getting jealous or something?

49:42.653 --> 49:44.553
Aah.

49:44.555 --> 49:46.488
Are you okay?

49:46.490 --> 49:48.359
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

49:55.232 --> 49:57.500
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

49:57.502 --> 49:58.637
Fine.

50:00.537 --> 50:03.607
It just nipped me a little,
that's all.

51:04.267 --> 51:05.700
Maggie.

51:05.702 --> 51:09.272
Psst. Maggie. Quit snoring
and check this out.

51:13.577 --> 51:16.479
Look, they didn't get
any bigger overnight.

51:16.481 --> 51:18.450
I found them like this
when I woke up.

51:19.783 --> 51:22.386
Told you they weren't
gonna hurt each other.

51:29.493 --> 51:30.861
Amazing, isn't it?

51:31.928 --> 51:34.497
There are anywhere from...

51:34.499 --> 51:38.801
50 to 75 trillion blood cells
in the human body.

51:38.803 --> 51:41.736
Each cell
has its own life span.

51:41.738 --> 51:45.341
Red blood cells last
for maybe four months.

51:45.343 --> 51:49.879
White blood cells last for
approximately a year and a half.

51:51.348 --> 51:54.783
Our bodies
are constantly changing.

51:54.785 --> 51:57.453
It's comforting, isn't it?

51:57.455 --> 52:00.490
To know that nothing's
permanent?

52:00.492 --> 52:02.390
Mr. Roberts would like
to see you now.

52:02.392 --> 52:03.691
He's here?

52:03.693 --> 52:08.598
Oh, yes. He'd like to see
you both. And...

52:08.600 --> 52:10.602
...you can bring them
with you.

52:14.906 --> 52:17.042
He can help you finish.

52:37.595 --> 52:40.062
And you double-cleansed.

52:40.064 --> 52:42.765
You drank
someone else's cleanses.

52:42.767 --> 52:46.002
It's important to know
it is a violation.

52:46.004 --> 52:50.575
It's a simple action. You just
gotta follow through. Okay?

52:54.711 --> 52:56.879
Paul? Maggie?

52:56.881 --> 52:59.814
So great to finally see you
in the flesh.

52:59.816 --> 53:02.884
Eric's just having a little
setback here, but...

53:02.886 --> 53:05.354
Don't let the flames
put you off.

53:05.356 --> 53:07.926
Come on. Let me get
a better look at you.

53:10.662 --> 53:13.028
You're
better-looking in person.

53:13.030 --> 53:16.897
Oh. How are you doing?

53:16.899 --> 53:19.567
I know this can be
a scary process,

53:19.569 --> 53:21.437
but all things considered,

53:21.439 --> 53:24.006
you look like you're doing
pretty good. How's it going?

53:24.008 --> 53:26.511
Talk to me.
What's on your mind?

53:28.780 --> 53:30.080
Paul?

53:32.450 --> 53:33.818
Well...

53:37.488 --> 53:39.388
I really appreciate

53:39.390 --> 53:41.693
what you're trying to do
here, Mr. Roberts, but...

53:42.961 --> 53:44.759
...these things
that came out of us,

53:44.761 --> 53:46.529
you didn't
tell us about that.

53:46.531 --> 53:49.564
You lied to us. Well,
you didn't lie, but you...

53:49.566 --> 53:51.635
didn't tell us
the whole story here.

53:54.905 --> 53:58.475
Fantastic. It's unbelievable
that you could tell me that.

53:59.477 --> 54:01.910
Maggie, do you mind if I...

54:01.912 --> 54:04.015
...just had
a moment with Paul?

54:06.050 --> 54:08.419
You know, you and I...

54:09.986 --> 54:14.756
We actually have a lot more
in common than you think.

54:14.758 --> 54:17.428
I was laughed out
of the medical community.

54:18.896 --> 54:20.395
And it really hurt.

54:20.397 --> 54:22.763
I mean, it hurt...
Are you listening to me?

54:22.765 --> 54:24.933
- Yeah.
- What'd I just say?

54:24.935 --> 54:27.703
Well, you said
that we're a lot alike.

54:27.705 --> 54:29.470
Right.

54:29.472 --> 54:31.673
Because we're human beings
in a lot of pain.

54:31.675 --> 54:34.644
I'm really thrilled you're
becoming more aware of yours.

54:34.646 --> 54:36.511
And I wanna ask you
a question.

54:36.513 --> 54:38.613
I know that
your ex-fiancée hurt you,

54:38.615 --> 54:39.948
and that's not your fault...

54:39.950 --> 54:43.486
But is there anything
you're doing wrong?

54:43.488 --> 54:45.022
Relationship-wise.

54:49.693 --> 54:52.560
People sometimes say
I suffocate them.

54:52.562 --> 54:53.865
Do you?

54:56.434 --> 54:58.100
It's okay, we all
have our stuff.

54:58.102 --> 54:59.968
Hey, Maggie?

54:59.970 --> 55:02.671
Come on over here a second.

55:02.673 --> 55:04.740
I'm gonna do a bit
more work with Eric.

55:04.742 --> 55:07.575
Then we'll move on to
the final stage of our program.

55:07.577 --> 55:10.178
You're in a really good place.
I'm excited about it.

55:10.180 --> 55:12.649
Okay? So just
give me a second.

55:18.823 --> 55:20.692
What did he say to you?

55:23.127 --> 55:25.761
Uh...

55:25.763 --> 55:27.830
- Did he make you cry?
- No.

55:27.832 --> 55:29.464
No.

55:29.466 --> 55:30.832
You look like
you were crying.

55:30.834 --> 55:32.770
I wasn't crying.

55:51.722 --> 55:53.888
Do we really have to wear
these blindfolds?

55:53.890 --> 55:56.591
You're a tough
cookie, aren't you, Maggie?

55:56.593 --> 55:58.560
We like to think
that...

55:58.562 --> 56:00.761
...if you're trying
to look inward,

56:00.763 --> 56:02.665
it just helps to remove
distractions,

56:02.667 --> 56:07.569
so we can look into
our own void and face it.

56:07.571 --> 56:08.937
Does that make sense?

56:08.939 --> 56:10.839
Is that
satisfactory?

56:10.841 --> 56:12.207
Yes.

56:12.209 --> 56:13.808
Good.

56:13.810 --> 56:16.712
Now, normally, I wouldn't
have you two together

56:16.714 --> 56:18.147
at this part
of the process,

56:18.149 --> 56:19.848
but Paul seems
a little uncertain

56:19.850 --> 56:22.252
about my methods, so...

56:23.888 --> 56:26.053
But I don't think
you'll have...

56:26.055 --> 56:29.191
...any more doubts once you see
what we're about to do here.

56:29.193 --> 56:32.727
So, Maggie, tell me. Why...?

56:32.729 --> 56:35.064
Why did you come
to this retreat?

56:35.066 --> 56:36.932
Well, I was married, and...

56:36.934 --> 56:38.533
I'm just gonna stop you there.

56:38.535 --> 56:41.136
I know that that was a story
that you fabricated

56:41.138 --> 56:42.803
during the selection process.

56:42.805 --> 56:44.872
Bu... I'm not angry at you,

56:44.874 --> 56:47.975
but I just want to encourage you
to be honest with yourself.

56:47.977 --> 56:49.645
You never had a husband, right?

56:49.647 --> 56:51.946
Yeah. Don't remind me.

56:51.948 --> 56:53.084
So why <i>are</i> you here?

56:55.053 --> 56:58.654
I wanted to lose some weight,
okay? Is that satisfactory?

56:58.656 --> 57:00.923
- Why'd you say it like that?
- What?

57:00.925 --> 57:02.758
"Is that satisfactory?"

57:02.760 --> 57:05.627
You're distancing yourself
from the process with sarcasm.

57:05.629 --> 57:07.064
Don't you wanna get better?

57:09.932 --> 57:13.271
Maggie? I asked you a question.

57:14.939 --> 57:16.774
Don't you wanna get better?

57:18.977 --> 57:20.008
Yeah.

57:20.010 --> 57:21.745
Then respect the process, okay?

57:22.879 --> 57:24.816
- Okay.
- Thank you.

57:26.850 --> 57:28.649
So...

57:28.651 --> 57:29.787
why are you here?

57:33.156 --> 57:35.022
I don't like the way I look.

57:35.024 --> 57:36.758
Sometimes.

57:36.760 --> 57:37.759
Sometimes?

57:37.761 --> 57:39.962
I could lose some weight.

57:39.964 --> 57:43.332
So you lied about having
a husband,

57:43.334 --> 57:45.834
and the act of suicide,

57:45.836 --> 57:47.772
because you wanna
lose some weight?

57:48.805 --> 57:50.071
- Yup.
- But why?

57:50.073 --> 57:52.040
Because I went on an audition,

57:52.042 --> 57:54.910
and the director said
I wasn't thin enough.

57:54.912 --> 57:57.145
It couldn't be something
as superficial

57:57.147 --> 57:59.214
as appearance
or going on an audition.

57:59.216 --> 58:01.049
I hadn't been on one
in a long time.

58:01.051 --> 58:02.283
I really wanted the part.

58:02.285 --> 58:03.819
And he said
I had a stomach...

58:03.821 --> 58:05.921
Maggie, there's no more time
for posturing.

58:05.923 --> 58:07.823
Stop fucking around!
Why are you here?

58:07.825 --> 58:10.127
You know what? Fuck you.

58:13.964 --> 58:16.899
I've been fucked
around a lot, okay?

58:16.901 --> 58:19.868
I put myself out there
for so long,

58:19.870 --> 58:23.337
and I just thought, "Fuck it,
fuck it, that's it. I...

58:23.339 --> 58:25.674
I give up."

58:25.676 --> 58:30.178
And I'm getting older
now, and I don't know if...

58:30.180 --> 58:33.048
...anyone could....

58:33.050 --> 58:35.149
Or I would...

58:35.151 --> 58:38.088
And I've been with
a lot of guys, okay?

58:39.823 --> 58:41.426
They all just...

58:54.305 --> 58:55.906
Thank you.

59:16.225 --> 59:18.495
Okay, Maggie, we're gonna
finish what we started.

59:19.463 --> 59:20.995
The cleanse you drank

59:20.997 --> 59:23.866
has expelled all the negativity
from your life,

59:23.868 --> 59:27.269
and put it into what you
see before you.

59:27.271 --> 59:31.042
You've reached the final stage
of our program.

59:32.410 --> 59:34.209
All right, I want you
to think about

59:34.211 --> 59:36.180
everything you just told me...

59:38.281 --> 59:39.816
...and pick up that knife...

59:40.785 --> 59:42.383
...and end it.

59:42.385 --> 59:43.887
End it now.

59:46.022 --> 59:49.193
It's the only way
you can be free.

01:00:04.807 --> 01:00:06.343
I can't.

01:00:10.046 --> 01:00:12.149
I'm s... I'm sorry, I can't.

01:00:15.118 --> 01:00:17.451
It's okay, Paul.
It's a lot to take in,

01:00:17.453 --> 01:00:19.053
but you have to believe me.

01:00:19.055 --> 01:00:20.957
I'm not the enemy here.

01:00:24.327 --> 01:00:27.995
What are you doing?
Paul, don't go.

01:00:27.997 --> 01:00:30.033
We can still fix this.

01:00:34.238 --> 01:00:35.807
Maggie.

01:00:37.173 --> 01:00:39.176
Maggie, hold on one sec.

01:00:50.988 --> 01:00:52.423
Too fast.

01:02:07.997 --> 01:02:11.399
Eric? Laurie?

01:02:11.401 --> 01:02:12.669
Hello?

01:02:18.441 --> 01:02:19.908
You okay?

01:02:30.888 --> 01:02:33.057
Hey, man. What's wrong?

01:02:34.557 --> 01:02:36.524
Paul, will you please
go away?

01:02:36.526 --> 01:02:39.261
I would just like to stay
here with her.

01:02:41.631 --> 01:02:44.332
Is Laurie...? Is she okay?

01:02:44.334 --> 01:02:46.602
She couldn't get it out.

01:02:48.539 --> 01:02:51.272
She just couldn't get it out.

01:02:51.274 --> 01:02:53.308
She didn't finish her cleanse.

01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:55.944
It fucked up her insides.

01:02:55.946 --> 01:02:57.946
It's all my fault.

01:02:57.948 --> 01:02:59.283
Lily says she's dead.

01:03:01.218 --> 01:03:03.917
Will you please go away?

01:03:03.919 --> 01:03:05.187
Does Ken know about this?

01:03:05.189 --> 01:03:07.055
Paul, just get the fuck
out of here!

01:03:07.057 --> 01:03:08.589
I wanna stay here with her!

01:03:11.294 --> 01:03:13.995
Hey, look, I was gonna come
and see you...

01:03:13.997 --> 01:03:15.433
We need to go now.

01:03:23.707 --> 01:03:27.510
Hey, guys! Sorry. Sorry,
I didn't mean to startle you.

01:03:30.546 --> 01:03:32.613
You, um...

01:03:32.615 --> 01:03:35.450
You probably heard about
what happened to Laurie, right?

01:03:35.452 --> 01:03:37.319
It's important
that you understand

01:03:37.321 --> 01:03:38.953
that what happened to her...

01:03:38.955 --> 01:03:41.557
...is a result of not
following instructions.

01:03:41.559 --> 01:03:45.093
You guys have been. You drank
all your cleanse, eliminated.

01:03:45.095 --> 01:03:46.560
She didn't.

01:03:46.562 --> 01:03:49.531
Anyway, given everything
that's happened, um...

01:03:49.533 --> 01:03:52.633
we've decided that...

01:03:52.635 --> 01:03:54.968
...the solution...

01:03:54.970 --> 01:03:58.473
...to our current problem
is that, um...

01:03:58.475 --> 01:04:00.475
Yeah, we need those back.

01:04:00.477 --> 01:04:02.245
- What?
- What's in the bag.

01:04:05.682 --> 01:04:09.750
Paul, listen. You guys have
shown so much courage.

01:04:09.752 --> 01:04:14.022
But now I'm giving you
permission not to finish.

01:04:14.024 --> 01:04:16.691
Just want you
to trust us.

01:04:16.693 --> 01:04:20.694
Hand over what's in the bag.
Let us handle it.

01:04:20.696 --> 01:04:23.033
Here, look.

01:04:24.434 --> 01:04:26.167
Take my car.

01:04:26.169 --> 01:04:27.769
Right over there.

01:04:27.771 --> 01:04:30.538
Give me the bag, drive my car
away. We're finished.

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:33.075
Scout's honor.

01:04:33.077 --> 01:04:35.379
Why...? Why do
you want them back?

01:04:39.149 --> 01:04:41.750
It's a layered thing, really.

01:04:41.752 --> 01:04:43.218
It's complex.

01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:45.587
You're not strong enough
to finish.

01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:48.723
- Yeah.
- Neither of you are.

01:04:48.725 --> 01:04:50.658
But they're a part of us.

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:53.062
- You can't have them.
- Paul.

01:04:53.064 --> 01:04:55.529
Fine.
You wanna know something?

01:04:55.531 --> 01:04:57.434
I got a secret to tell you.

01:04:59.736 --> 01:05:01.703
I didn't even finish
the cleanse. Me.

01:05:01.705 --> 01:05:03.540
Didn't have the guts.

01:05:05.175 --> 01:05:07.241
Lily had to do it for me.

01:05:07.243 --> 01:05:10.145
She was the only one strong
enough to finish this program.

01:05:10.147 --> 01:05:13.649
I guess we're not all
capable of change.

01:05:13.651 --> 01:05:17.819
We just don't want anyone
else to get hurt.

01:05:17.821 --> 01:05:21.723
Give us the bag, and we'll
shut this whole thing down.

01:05:21.725 --> 01:05:23.558
It's over.

01:05:25.361 --> 01:05:27.197
Get off me!

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:34.234
Paul. Paul.
It's gonna kill you, Paul.

01:06:20.617 --> 01:06:22.586
Why did they just let us
go like that?

01:06:23.687 --> 01:06:26.488
What if they're right?

01:06:26.490 --> 01:06:29.894
What if we kill these things
and it helps?

01:06:32.396 --> 01:06:34.796
I think we should just
pull over and end this.

01:06:34.798 --> 01:06:36.531
But we don't know, Maggie.

01:06:36.533 --> 01:06:38.868
- Yeah, exactly.
- It could get worse.

01:06:47.577 --> 01:06:49.544
They've been in the bag
for a while.

01:06:49.546 --> 01:06:51.279
They're probably just,
you know...

01:06:51.281 --> 01:06:52.550
getting claustrophobic.

01:06:53.716 --> 01:06:55.285
Hey.

01:06:57.319 --> 01:06:59.890
It's okay. Shh.

01:07:02.459 --> 01:07:03.894
It's okay.

01:07:05.595 --> 01:07:07.198
It's all right.

01:07:12.468 --> 01:07:15.205
- Sorry, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:07:22.245 --> 01:07:23.243
Paul.

01:07:23.245 --> 01:07:24.381
Hm?

01:07:26.182 --> 01:07:27.182
They're all sick...

01:07:28.752 --> 01:07:30.788
Paul.

01:07:33.756 --> 01:07:35.291
Watch out!

01:08:02.218 --> 01:08:03.350
Fucking...

01:08:04.988 --> 01:08:07.654
- Maggie. Maggie, don't.
- Fucking...

01:08:07.656 --> 01:08:10.258
Maggie, stop!

01:09:24.332 --> 01:09:25.769
Aah.
