You know the difference

15:45.679 --> 15:48.279
He ain't going to slow you down

15:58.725 --> 16:03.394
Now, who might
you be visiting today?

I'd better do some pruning
on those elms out back.

to the azaleas, I guess.

You right about that, Billy.

That old boy keeps
this place looking good.

yourself in a heap of shit?

1:02:15.833 --> 1:02:20.168

I saw something so strange,
I cannot figure it out.

Last night, I saw someone
driving your car

1:02:29.913 --> 1:02:33.749

in the passenger seat.

1:02:33.751 --> 1:02:35.217

1:02:39.823 --> 1:02:42.090

off the sheriff

1:02:42.092 --> 1:02:44.159
and some other no accounts
in a game of poker,

1:02:44.161 --> 1:02:49.131

kick up, tear out of there.

1:02:49.133 --> 1:02:53.802
I look out the window,
and the patrol car is burning,

1:02:53.804 --> 1:02:55.904

He grabbed his gun
and went out there,

1:03:06.316 --> 1:03:11.253
and we took off after the bike,
and that's when I saw the car.

1:03:11.255 --> 1:03:14.055
- Well...

1:03:14.057 --> 1:03:16.958
- Yeah.
I don't mean to be getting

1:03:16.960 --> 1:03:19.995
in your business, son,
but I just--

1:03:19.997 --> 1:03:23.198
I couldn't figure it out.

1:03:25.536 --> 1:03:28.136
Politics is bad business, son.

1:03:28.138 --> 1:03:31.273

1:03:31.275 --> 1:03:35.977

1:32:38.620 --> 1:32:41.555
- To be honest,
we were drinking,

1:32:41.557 --> 1:32:42.889
and we did have
a little bit of marijuana,

1:32:42.891 --> 1:32:45.091
but we didn't blow
nothing up.

1:32:45.093 --> 1:32:47.127

1:32:47.129 --> 1:32:49.896
- Yes, sir.

a nefarious goddamned criminal?

1:32:55.604 --> 1:32:58.038

but last night,

1:32:58.040 --> 1:33:01.308
he was right here.

1:33:01.310 --> 1:33:03.343

1:33:03.345 --> 1:33:05.579
You the one that he done
busted out, ain't you?

1:33:05.581 --> 1:33:08.181
- I busted myself out.

1:33:08.183 --> 1:33:10.650
- [chuckles]
Well, I'll be.

1:33:10.652 --> 1:33:14.054
Okay, I guess I'll let you
deal with her, Doc.

Talk!

buying any of this horse shit.

1:33:27.903 --> 1:33:31.138
- It's true.
- You want to meet my dog?

1:33:31.139 --> 1:33:34.374

tried to blown me up yourself.

1:33:34.376 --> 1:33:38.345
It don't matter; I figure I'll
never see you again.

1:33:38.347 --> 1:33:40.347

1:33:43.318 --> 1:33:46.319
- That I am.

1:33:46.321 --> 1:33:48.922
I need to know some things.

1:33:48.924 --> 1:33:50.890
- What's that?

1:33:50.892 --> 1:33:55.929

a bad man.

1:33:55.931 --> 1:33:57.831
Ahh!

1:33:57.833 --> 1:34:02.836

all these things are relative.

1:34:05.674 --> 1:34:07.641

you'll understand.

1:34:12.848 --> 1:34:14.848

No, I'll never understand.

Dad.
