I can tell you what I saw, but I
don't think there's a man here

04:12.832 --> 04:16.598

- You were shot ?
- Right here.

Right in the stomach.

04:23.543 --> 04:25.477
I felt the bullet enter me,

04:25.545 --> 04:28.878

was being on the foor.

04:28.949 --> 04:31.713

and I could taste blood in my throat.

- What man ?

The same guy who tried to talk
the gun guy out of hurting anyone.

04:37.857 --> 04:39.518

04:39.593 --> 04:44.030
He touched me, and he said
I was gonna be okay.

feel my legs and arms again.

- He's gone.
- They let him leave the scene ?

be a phony. He had no driver's license.

have been accounted for ?

the victims used-- the palm of his hand.

no deep mystery here.

Well, there could be
several reasons.

13:11.370 --> 13:14.305

It could very well have affected
her center of speech, her language.

13:25.418 --> 13:28.387
But you can't explain it exactly.

13:28.488 --> 13:31.423

were miraculously healed...

vanished into thin air.

- What are you talking about ?
- Maybe I can bring you
up to speed, Agent Mulder.

17:51.183 --> 17:55.517
- Did you take these ?
- They had quite an argument,
as you might gather.

17:57.923 --> 18:02.189
You seem surprised. Surely you
were aware they knew each other.

18:02.261 --> 18:04.663
Or what brought them
here together.

18:04.797 --> 18:06.594

- Did he hurt her ?
- No.

No, she collapsed
after he left.

she might not have survived.

I don't know. I was forced
to keep a discreet distance.

you wouldn't have followed them here.

kept in this house.

they would’ve chosen to meet here.

in this summer house again.

18:49.241 --> 18:52.233
I know my mother.
She kept her word.

18:52.311 --> 18:55.144
It could be something very old.

18:55.214 --> 18:57.148
Certainly something very important.

Scully, move away from him.
Come stand behind me.

42:59.991 --> 43:03.324
I've come to you at great risk.
I mean you no harm.

43:03.394 --> 43:07.125
I have a long and complicated story
to tell you.

43:07.198 --> 43:09.928
- He knows about your sister.
- How do I know you’re for real ?

43:10.001 --> 43:13.801
- I was at that restaurant.
I healed those people.
- Yes, but how ?

43:13.871 --> 43:15.896
I can explain everything to you.

43:15.973 --> 43:18.908
First I want you
to come somewhere with me.

43:18.976 --> 43:21.137
Come with me to see my mother.
