02:10.793 --> 02:11.926
What's that?

02:11.928 --> 02:14.898
John! What's happening?

02:17.734 --> 02:19.337
Oh, my god!

02:24.607 --> 02:26.676
What the hell?

02:38.756 --> 02:42.290
<i>The rogue wave came out of
nowhere, with no warning...</i>

02:42.292 --> 02:45.527
<i>a 40-foot wall of solid water
hit us like a freight train...</i>

02:45.529 --> 02:47.632
<i>and was gone before we knew it.</i>

02:55.706 --> 02:57.838
<i>Suddenly we were upside-down...</i>

02:57.840 --> 03:00.010
<i>with water flooding
through the companion way.</i>

03:04.381 --> 03:05.483
Jim!

03:15.492 --> 03:17.825
Are you okay?

03:17.827 --> 03:21.663
- Okay? Fucking kidding, we're upside-down, mate!
- We're bloody sinking!

03:21.665 --> 03:26.004
We won't sink. The boat will start rising
when it equalizes with outside, okay?

03:29.606 --> 03:32.040
We're gonna die! We're gonna die! Jesus!

03:32.042 --> 03:35.610
No! Hold on! Hold on!

03:35.612 --> 03:40.415
Shit... guys, grab anything you can!

03:40.417 --> 03:43.655
The aft cabin is the
highest point! Come on!

04:08.644 --> 04:10.947
Look, that's about as
good as we're gonna get it.

04:12.416 --> 04:16.784
Rick! Rick! What are you doing?

04:16.786 --> 04:18.719
Emergency beacon.

04:18.721 --> 04:21.024
All right, come on.

04:24.894 --> 04:26.527
I can't go in there.

04:26.529 --> 04:27.731
Come on, Phil.

04:28.832 --> 04:30.668
Get in!

04:39.942 --> 04:42.810
What now? What the fuck do we do now?

04:42.812 --> 04:44.548
Here... eat.

04:52.122 --> 04:55.923
We're gonna die.

04:55.925 --> 04:58.125
- We're rooted.
- Shut the fuck up.

04:58.127 --> 05:00.729
She's gonna break up... sooner or later.

05:00.731 --> 05:03.731
Storm or container ship, we're going down.

05:03.733 --> 05:07.702
Just keep calm, okay?
That's the main thing.

05:07.704 --> 05:10.772
We'll be all right.

05:10.774 --> 05:12.744
So we just turn this
thing the right-side-up?

05:13.976 --> 05:17.012
- Can't... impossible.
- Why not?

05:17.014 --> 05:20.981
Once a multi-hull
capsizes, it stays that way.

05:20.983 --> 05:24.519
Fucked on the drawing
board... bloody death traps!

05:24.521 --> 05:29.056
How about we rig something up,
make a mast, sail upside-down?

05:29.058 --> 05:32.929
She's 75 percent underwater,
all right... unnavigable.

05:34.531 --> 05:40.202
Hey, we got food, we got water.

05:40.204 --> 05:43.805
I got tanks full of
it, thousands of liters.

05:43.807 --> 05:46.207
We just have to wait.

05:46.209 --> 05:50.578
We'll be okay. I want you guys to relax.

05:50.580 --> 05:54.616
<i>The only way forward was
to adapt, learn to survive.</i>

05:54.618 --> 05:58.652
<i>We needed to accept the
situation and go with it.</i>

05:58.654 --> 06:01.058
<i>But all they could
think about was rescue.</i>

06:22.712 --> 06:24.512
Mutilation.

06:24.514 --> 06:26.113
Yeah, of a corpse.

06:26.115 --> 06:29.116
Wouldn't need to do it, if
you'd built an escape hatch.

06:29.118 --> 06:32.921
Now someone's gonna hear us, right?

06:32.923 --> 06:34.989
How long before someone picks
up the signal, do you reckon?

06:34.991 --> 06:37.058
Hard to say.

06:37.060 --> 06:41.630
Not too many boats out
here... have to be a plane.

06:41.632 --> 06:45.133
Well, how close do they have
to be to pick up a signal?

06:45.135 --> 06:47.137
Depends on the conditions.

06:53.911 --> 06:56.577
<i>I'd missed my scheduled
departure date.</i>

06:56.579 --> 06:59.113
<i>My original crew had dropped
out at the last minute...</i>

06:59.115 --> 07:01.649
<i>and I needed to find
replacements at short notice.</i>

07:01.651 --> 07:03.851
Jim, check it out.

07:03.853 --> 07:06.154
<i>I wanted to sail before
the weather changed.</i>

07:06.156 --> 07:08.123
- John Glennie.
- Jim, pleased to meet ya'.

07:08.125 --> 07:09.991
Yeah, good to meet you.

07:09.993 --> 07:11.993
So what's the weather like
in Tonga this time of year?

07:11.995 --> 07:15.664
Oh, it's the tropics, mate.
You know? Sun, warm, beaches...

07:15.666 --> 07:17.731
more beautiful women than
you can shake your stick at.

07:17.733 --> 07:18.832
I like the sound of that.

07:18.834 --> 07:21.770
Yeah, the Friendly Islands!

07:21.772 --> 07:24.104
Could do with a cook. You
got any sailing experience?

07:24.106 --> 07:26.207
Absolutely none.

07:26.209 --> 07:28.642
Some... a bit.

07:28.644 --> 07:30.044
Oh, well. Yeah, it doesn't matter.

07:30.046 --> 07:33.013
I just need extra bodies to keep watch.

07:33.015 --> 07:35.049
How long would it take?

07:35.051 --> 07:36.984
Mm... two weeks tops.

07:36.986 --> 07:39.621
Trade winds are pretty
strong this time of year.

07:39.623 --> 07:42.890
You guys should come on down, check it out.

07:42.892 --> 07:44.060
Sure.

07:45.361 --> 07:47.128
Could be just what you need, mate.

07:47.130 --> 07:49.964
Eh? Get away for a bit,
time to think, clear the air.

07:49.966 --> 07:52.200
- What about you?
- Maybe.

07:52.202 --> 07:53.969
Seriously?

07:53.971 --> 07:56.604
Sure, why not?

07:56.606 --> 07:58.707
Doctor phoned this morning.

07:58.709 --> 08:02.676
Going to see her tomorrow, but
it looks like I'm in the clear.

08:02.678 --> 08:05.714
Latest scan says it's retreating.

08:05.716 --> 08:08.215
Fantastic, man. Fantastic.

08:08.217 --> 08:11.652
Rose Noelle, leaving two
days time. What do you reckon?

08:11.654 --> 08:13.921
Go on. Write them down.

08:13.923 --> 08:15.222
C'mon, Martha. Don't do this.

08:15.224 --> 08:17.392
I mean it. Write them down.

08:17.394 --> 08:19.226
What?

08:19.228 --> 08:21.395
The people I'll have to get
in contact with when you drown.

08:21.397 --> 08:23.964
Oh, for Christ's sake, have some faith.

08:23.966 --> 08:28.202
You've never been to sea in your whole, damn,
stupid, landlocked life. You can barely swim.

08:28.204 --> 08:31.306
We decided to take a break to see
if this is what we really want.

08:31.308 --> 08:32.974
Not that kind of break.

08:32.976 --> 08:35.409
That guy's gonna have you
cooking dawn till dusk.

08:35.410 --> 08:38.078
That is, when you're not throwing
up. You get seasick in a kayak.

08:38.080 --> 08:44.080
Look, I'm sorry I can't be on call
for you, but I really need to do this.

08:44.220 --> 08:45.886
Not your last will and testament.

08:45.888 --> 08:48.258
Just a name and phone number in the States.

08:51.828 --> 08:54.228
Don't forget that. You'll need it.

08:54.230 --> 08:55.765
I'll wait in the car.

09:18.421 --> 09:23.091
Knows how to pick her moments,
doesn't she? Bloody hour of departure.

09:23.093 --> 09:27.164
I s'pose, oh, you know Martha, she's probably
just thinking of the worst that could...

09:29.065 --> 09:32.299
Neither of us are
exactly keen on this idea.

09:32.301 --> 09:35.102
But it's good you're going. It's important.

09:35.104 --> 09:37.874
No regrets, all that.

09:51.887 --> 09:54.889
Uh... we'll say goodbye here.

09:54.891 --> 09:56.091
Oh, you don't want to come down?

09:56.093 --> 09:58.860
No, I'm not big on public farewells.

09:58.862 --> 10:01.332
And it looks like Martha is
in one of her moods, so...

10:20.816 --> 10:23.016
Be careful.

10:23.018 --> 10:24.318
Don't fall overboard.

10:24.320 --> 10:26.821
I won't.

10:26.823 --> 10:28.323
See you in a couple of weeks.

10:28.325 --> 10:29.759
Bye-bye.

10:38.068 --> 10:42.473
Bye! See ya'! Love you!

10:44.007 --> 10:46.276
Oh, this is gonna be so good for him!

10:48.044 --> 10:49.877
- See ya, Dad!
- Bye, Dad!

10:49.879 --> 10:52.480
- See ya.
- Bye. Bye, baby! Bye.

10:52.482 --> 10:56.351
Be nice to your mum! Be good!

10:56.353 --> 10:58.886
Oh, hey, don't be like that!

10:58.888 --> 11:01.890
Us girls, we'll look after each other.

11:01.892 --> 11:04.060
Where's your mate?

11:06.463 --> 11:09.033
Is she all right?

11:17.206 --> 11:21.175
Oh, come on, cheer up. They'll be fine.

11:21.177 --> 11:24.946
Just think of all the fun you'll have when
you get him back, he'll be hot to trot!

11:24.948 --> 11:30.020
No, it's... it's not
that... we're breaking up.

11:37.459 --> 11:40.361
Hey, Jim, give Phil a
hand with the fenders.

11:40.363 --> 11:43.298
<i>I'd waited a long time
for this adventure.</i>

11:43.300 --> 11:46.233
<i>Unfortunately, I wasn't sharing
the first leg of the voyage...</i>

11:46.235 --> 11:49.404
<i>with the men I wanted,
but at least I had a crew.</i>

11:49.406 --> 11:53.042
<i>Once we made landfall in
Tonga, I would replace them.</i>

12:07.958 --> 12:13.958
<i>This voyage was going to take me back to my
old cruising haunts of the South Pacific.</i>

12:14.330 --> 12:17.966
<i>New beginnings, a fresh
start, love and adventure.</i>

12:17.968 --> 12:20.235
<i>I had invested everything
I had in Rose Noelle.</i>

12:20.237 --> 12:24.141
<i>She was my pride and
joy, my home, my haven.</i>

12:28.110 --> 12:29.212
What do you reckon, Jim?

12:32.349 --> 12:34.115
Jim looks a bit green around the gills.

12:34.117 --> 12:35.586
Yeah, he'll be alright.

12:36.652 --> 12:39.287
She's all yours, mate.

12:39.289 --> 12:41.222
<i>- Oh, yeah, okay.
- The extended marine forecast...</i>

12:41.224 --> 12:43.558
<i>for all of New Zealand
until the 6th of June.</i>

12:43.560 --> 12:48.328
<i>An intense tropical cyclone is situated
off the east coast of the North Island...</i>

12:48.330 --> 12:53.367
<i>with south-westerly gales gusting to
50 knots and seas rising to 6 meters.</i>

12:53.369 --> 12:59.173
<i>For all of the east coast...
severe weather warning...</i>

12:59.175 --> 13:03.147
<i>For all of the west coast
from Terawhiti to Cape Egmont.</i>

13:05.681 --> 13:07.481
<i>This was music to my ears.</i>

13:07.483 --> 13:10.318
<i>There'd be no beating into the wind.</i>

13:10.320 --> 13:14.959
<i>We'd sail on a broad reach all the way to
Tonga, and make faster time than I'd hoped.</i>

13:17.927 --> 13:20.160
What's he doing?

13:20.162 --> 13:24.634
Don't know. Look's as those
he's putting up more sails.

13:26.936 --> 13:30.170
A plane would have to be close.
Within a 100 nautical miles.

13:30.172 --> 13:33.241
Come on, John, honestly.
How long before they find us?

13:33.243 --> 13:37.178
What's she gonna remember of me... of us?

13:37.180 --> 13:38.413
John?

13:38.415 --> 13:40.347
Five days.

13:40.349 --> 13:43.519
It's okay, mate. Five days
and we'll be out of here...

13:45.220 --> 13:47.123
according to the oracle.

13:54.597 --> 13:59.399
<i>I estimated our position to be
about 140 miles off the east coast.</i>

13:59.401 --> 14:03.337
<i>The EPIRB signal was well outside
the reach of domestic aircraft.</i>

14:03.339 --> 14:07.277
<i>We'd need to pin our hopes
on an international flight.</i>

14:13.349 --> 14:15.616
Jesus, I can't breathe!

14:15.618 --> 14:17.217
It's time you took a turn back there.

14:17.219 --> 14:19.389
- Oh, I was just...
- Oh, shit!

14:23.059 --> 14:27.495
Can't be much longer now. Surely,
somebody's gotta hear that signal.

14:27.497 --> 14:30.430
They will. We've been
pretty lucky up till now.

14:30.432 --> 14:36.432
Lucky? In what way have we been lucky?

14:36.638 --> 14:39.673
If one of us had been on deck when that
wave hit, it would've been curtains.

14:39.675 --> 14:41.641
If we'd cut the parachute,
we would've been fine.

14:41.643 --> 14:45.712
Hey, it was your idea to put it out
in the first place. Remember that.

14:45.714 --> 14:49.750
What's that supposed to mean?
You knew the storm was coming.

14:49.752 --> 14:52.388
You put us out here! You risked our lives!

15:05.801 --> 15:08.068
Right, Rick. Let her go!

15:08.070 --> 15:10.505
<i>Leaving on a journey and
arriving at a destination...</i>

15:10.507 --> 15:12.774
<i>is the best part of cruising.</i>

15:12.776 --> 15:17.345
<i>To be honest, I dislike blue water
sailing, it bores me to tears.</i>

15:17.347 --> 15:22.183
<i>The excitement of bad weather and
long night watches soon wears off.</i>

15:22.185 --> 15:26.390
<i>For me, it was all about seeing the
world and taking my home with me.</i>

15:28.224 --> 15:30.326
There's a man who knows what he's doing.

15:40.302 --> 15:43.136
We're flying along, mate.
She's got a great turn of speed.

15:43.138 --> 15:47.241
Oh, yeah. She's fast,
just how I like my women.

15:47.243 --> 15:51.379
So, who've you left behind? Do
you have someone in Australia?

15:51.381 --> 15:54.347
More interested in who I
could be sailing towards, mate.

15:54.349 --> 15:56.616
Hey, who's the lady in
the picture down below?

15:56.618 --> 16:02.590
Now that is the original Rose
Noelle, Tahitian princess.

16:02.592 --> 16:06.159
I named the boat after
her. Love of my life.

16:06.161 --> 16:07.727
Do you still love her?

16:07.729 --> 16:09.730
In spirit.

16:09.732 --> 16:12.699
We're going a bit fast,
John? Don't you think?

16:12.701 --> 16:14.869
I mean, we're not in that
much of a bloody hurry, are we?

16:14.871 --> 16:18.106
Well, I want to get as far
as we can before nightfall.

16:18.108 --> 16:20.574
- But why?
- Well, the weather's changing.

16:20.576 --> 16:22.543
The weather's changing? What
do you mean? What's it doing?

16:22.545 --> 16:28.545
Well, there's a storm coming.
We're going to catch it.

16:28.751 --> 16:32.489
It'll be on us pretty soon. And
then we'll do some real sailing.

16:43.733 --> 16:47.501
<i>A little knowledge
is a dangerous thing.</i>

16:47.503 --> 16:50.737
I don't like this. I
really don't like this.

16:50.739 --> 16:53.841
<i>Phil had limited coastal
sailing experience.</i>

16:53.843 --> 16:57.477
<i>Maybe that's why he was so
anxious. His fear was contagious.</i>

16:57.479 --> 16:59.380
How long's this going to last?

16:59.382 --> 17:01.582
What's the big surprise?

17:01.584 --> 17:04.385
If you guys heard the marine forecast,
you would've known about this.

17:04.387 --> 17:07.621
This storm's gonna blow us all
the way to Tonga in no time.

17:07.623 --> 17:10.726
You sailed us into a storm on purpose?

17:14.497 --> 17:18.598
Get us... come on! Get
on the radio now! Fuck...

17:18.601 --> 17:21.601
Call the Coast Guard. Get us a helicopter.

17:21.603 --> 17:23.838
Get us off. Hello? Is the Coast Guard...

17:23.839 --> 17:27.175
Hey, hey, hey! That radio's short-range.

17:27.176 --> 17:29.177
There's no one out here to hear you.

17:29.179 --> 17:31.278
- Why?
- Why what?

17:31.280 --> 17:34.181
Why is it short range?

17:34.183 --> 17:36.484
Because I don't have a license.

17:36.486 --> 17:38.819
Why not?

17:38.821 --> 17:41.421
'Cause I don't believe in them,
and I don't want to waste the money.

17:41.423 --> 17:43.724
When you're out here, you're out
here. That's the journey you're on.

17:43.726 --> 17:46.893
Fuck you, mate! We're gonna flip!

17:46.895 --> 17:50.965
Look, we're not gonna
flip. This yacht can't flip.

17:50.967 --> 17:55.236
I've sailed 40,000 miles in one of
these. This is just another blow.

17:55.238 --> 17:58.238
- And when was that, 20 years ago?
- Yeah.

17:58.240 --> 18:01.976
I built this baby with my own hands,
we've already crossed the Tasman together.

18:01.978 --> 18:05.582
You're safe, Rick. Relax.

18:08.617 --> 18:09.917
Oh, God.

18:09.919 --> 18:11.552
What about a sea anchor?
You got one of those?

18:11.554 --> 18:12.986
What for?

18:12.988 --> 18:14.988
Well, to stop us bouncing
round while we ride it out.

18:14.990 --> 18:16.492
Yeah.

18:18.795 --> 18:19.860
Have you got one?

18:19.862 --> 18:21.562
Of course, I have...

18:21.564 --> 18:23.363
Well, then let's throw it
out, slow us down a bit.

18:23.365 --> 18:26.700
No way, it's brand new.
It cost me a lot of money.

18:26.702 --> 18:29.402
- For Christ's sakes.
- The wind turn and goes.

18:29.404 --> 18:32.273
- Let's take take a vote.
- Yeah.

18:32.275 --> 18:34.007
It's not a bloody democracy, mate.

18:34.009 --> 18:36.546
Hey, fuck you! Where is it?

18:49.659 --> 18:51.929
Okay, throw us the bag!

19:05.741 --> 19:09.345
Okay, hold onto the bag!

19:11.314 --> 19:13.617
- Use this rope!
- Got it!

19:31.933 --> 19:33.467
Ready?

19:33.469 --> 19:34.705
Now!

19:47.316 --> 19:50.484
<i>If I made one big
mistake, this was it...</i>

19:50.486 --> 19:54.021
<i>allowing myself to be bulldozed
by a terrified crew...</i>

19:54.023 --> 19:56.890
<i>with no experience of
blue water sailing.</i>

19:56.892 --> 19:59.659
<i>The noise of waves smashing against
a multihull is like gunfire.</i>

19:59.661 --> 20:01.961
That should do the trick.

20:01.963 --> 20:03.966
<i>It can be terrifying if
you're not used to it.</i>

20:09.005 --> 20:11.405
What the... What the hell was that!

20:11.407 --> 20:13.573
Chute must've fouled.

20:13.575 --> 20:15.942
- Then we've got to free it.
- No, too dangerous.

20:15.944 --> 20:17.945
It's pulling us side-on.

20:17.947 --> 20:20.980
Well, you make a mistake pulling it
in, you could lose a finger or a hand.

20:20.982 --> 20:23.351
Then we cut it loose.

20:23.353 --> 20:26.586
No. Hey! The tiller's lashed.

20:26.588 --> 20:29.422
All we can do is sit tight and wait it out.

20:29.424 --> 20:31.859
We can't leave the chute like that.

20:31.861 --> 20:34.631
I'm the skipper, Rick, remember?

20:41.738 --> 20:45.741
Get some sleep. We'll sort it in
the morning when conditions improve.

21:12.802 --> 21:15.069
<i>So we just locked ourselves
down in the scrum...</i>

21:15.071 --> 21:18.538
This will put a smile in your
eye and some lead in your pencil.

21:18.540 --> 21:20.975
What's that?

21:20.977 --> 21:25.946
Epirb. We can set it to send out distress
signals, any plane flying over, it'll pick it up.

21:25.948 --> 21:29.449
<i>He had a double jointed arse.</i>

21:29.451 --> 21:32.786
<i>Mick, me mate the master farter.</i>

21:32.788 --> 21:37.056
<i>Put the art back into farting
with his custom tailored farts.</i>

21:37.058 --> 21:41.861
<i>Mick, me mate the master
farter broke new ground...</i>

21:41.863 --> 21:45.568
<i>in breaking wind with
his double jointed arse.</i>

21:50.672 --> 21:56.110
You risked our lives! What are
you after, eh? Insurance money?

21:56.112 --> 21:59.079
I'm not insured. I don't believe in it.

21:59.081 --> 22:01.681
I'm insured with the Gods,
not the bottom feeders.

22:01.683 --> 22:03.817
Hey, you're in my space, mate.

22:03.819 --> 22:06.519
What happens if a wave flips
the boat the right side up?

22:06.521 --> 22:08.188
Are we gonna be fine with all this water?

22:08.190 --> 22:11.458
It can't happen, okay. It won't happen.

22:11.460 --> 22:14.461
No, no. We've got to cut an escape hatch.

22:14.463 --> 22:17.931
You are not cutting another
hole in this bloody boat.

22:17.933 --> 22:21.168
Now you have some respect for her, for
me, for everything I've put in to it.

22:21.170 --> 22:24.772
No bloody way. This is our
lives we're talking about.

22:24.774 --> 22:27.444
If you won't do it, I will.

22:32.882 --> 22:37.951
<i>It was painful to watch, like
the violation of a loved one.</i>

22:37.953 --> 22:40.588
<i>But Rick was not a
man to argue with.</i>

22:40.590 --> 22:43.959
<i>Once he made his
mind up, that was it.</i>

23:30.805 --> 23:34.274
<i>Breaking outside didn't
make them feel any better.</i>

23:34.276 --> 23:40.014
<i>Seeing the magnitude of what we were up
against, their morale sank to a new low.</i>

23:40.016 --> 23:43.954
<i>Any hope of a quick rescue
seemed a distant prospect.</i>

24:14.016 --> 24:19.855
Rick, Rick... the light.

24:27.296 --> 24:29.533
Wait a minute. It will come back on.

24:33.869 --> 24:35.738
That's it.

24:42.644 --> 24:45.746
<i>Once the EPIRB battery
died we were on our own...</i>

24:45.748 --> 24:49.115
<i>outside standard flight
paths and shipping lanes.</i>

24:49.117 --> 24:53.053
<i>Wind, current and the gods
were taking us for a ride.</i>

24:53.055 --> 24:57.690
<i>The only control we
had was over ourselves.</i>

24:57.692 --> 25:01.094
Rick, Jim, give us a hand outside, eh.

25:01.096 --> 25:05.267
<i>We needed to put differences
behind us and work as a team.</i>

26:01.457 --> 26:02.859
Okay.

26:08.698 --> 26:10.200
I got it.

26:13.835 --> 26:15.104
All right.

26:41.863 --> 26:44.230
Got it.

26:44.232 --> 26:46.033
Phil, give us a bloody hand, would ya'?

26:46.035 --> 26:47.767
I'm busy.

26:47.769 --> 26:49.870
I don't know why you're doing that anyway?

26:49.872 --> 26:52.171
No point. Don't bother.

26:52.173 --> 26:56.345
We need to make ourselves more visible to
passing ships, planes, whatever. That's why.

27:17.767 --> 27:19.032
What else is down there?

27:19.034 --> 27:21.502
Oh, Jesus! Watch what you're doing!

27:21.504 --> 27:23.803
Take it easy, mate. I didn't mean to.

27:23.805 --> 27:25.973
Screw you, Rick. Look! Look! I'm bleeding!

27:25.975 --> 27:28.508
Oh, get over it. Jesus,
you're a bloody moron.

27:28.510 --> 27:30.079
You...

27:32.280 --> 27:35.047
- And we ration all food from now on.
- Who says?

27:35.049 --> 27:40.019
It's the smart thing to do. We don't
know how long we're going to be out here.

27:40.021 --> 27:43.055
And we're gonna get hold of the sails.
You're gonna dive for them, tomorrow.

27:43.057 --> 27:47.294
I've told you already. You
can't sail this boat upside down.

27:47.296 --> 27:51.165
And we make decisions by vote from now on.
Majority rules and we stick to the rules.

27:51.167 --> 27:54.567
Used to be a cop, didn't
you? Hey, let it go, Rick.

27:54.569 --> 27:59.072
Man, your emotional body
is starving your neuronet.

27:59.074 --> 28:00.541
Have faith in the God within.

28:00.543 --> 28:04.178
You can shove your dumb-ass
religion up your skinny ass.

28:04.180 --> 28:07.313
Rick, pass me the cabbage.

28:07.315 --> 28:09.786
Where's the knife? This one's shit.

28:11.452 --> 28:15.088
Now... we got tuna.

28:15.090 --> 28:21.090
There was a lemon somewhere laying
around in this leaking son of a boat.

28:21.095 --> 28:25.267
All right, there we are. Okay.

28:28.036 --> 28:33.372
When I was a young boy... I
wanted to sail around the world.

28:33.374 --> 28:38.515
That's the life for me. Living on the sea.

28:40.181 --> 28:46.181
Spirit of a sailor
circumnavigates the globe.

28:47.288 --> 28:48.621
The lust of...

28:48.623 --> 28:51.094
I just spent six months in a leaky boat.

28:52.193 --> 28:54.494
Lucky just to be afloat.

28:54.496 --> 28:56.263
What song is that?

28:56.265 --> 28:57.464
That's a kiwi classic, mate.

28:57.466 --> 29:01.334
No. Aotearoa. Yeah.

29:01.336 --> 29:03.439
I've gotta get out of here.

29:04.506 --> 29:05.975
Glisten like a pearl.

29:10.144 --> 29:12.949
I just spent six months on a leaky boat!

29:17.886 --> 29:20.152
<i>I think Rick felt
he'd lost Jim to us...</i>

29:20.154 --> 29:22.890
<i>like someone had
stolen his girlfriend.</i>

29:22.892 --> 29:27.460
<i>Or maybe something else was
going on inside his head.</i>

29:27.462 --> 29:32.032
<i>Meanwhile back home, Jim's girlfriend
Martha was becoming concerned.</i>

29:32.034 --> 29:35.401
<i>By now he should have
made contact from Tonga.</i>

29:35.403 --> 29:39.206
<i>After three weeks adrift, no
one had begun searching for us.</i>

29:39.208 --> 29:42.312
I think it still works. I
haven't used it for a while.

29:44.078 --> 29:45.180
Here you go.

29:47.248 --> 29:48.150
Okay.

29:50.385 --> 29:52.052
You're not gonna be able
to get through anyway.

29:52.054 --> 29:56.590
What's that, Darren? What did you say?

29:56.592 --> 29:58.659
You're not gonna be able to get through.

29:58.661 --> 30:01.661
Gordon'll radio for you. He
arranged a time with John.

30:01.663 --> 30:03.432
What do you mean?

30:05.334 --> 30:08.134
Gordon's supposed to call
him and get his position...

30:08.136 --> 30:13.073
but John's not gonna be able to call him or
name the boat, because his radio's illegal.

30:13.075 --> 30:14.541
That's the deal.

30:14.543 --> 30:16.243
The deal?

30:16.245 --> 30:18.245
I heard him talking about it.

30:18.247 --> 30:23.382
Gordon's gonna call him and
give him a weather forecast.

30:23.384 --> 30:26.152
Well, why didn't you tell us this before?

30:26.154 --> 30:29.323
Your dad wouldn't've have gone if he'd
known they didn't have a proper radio.

30:29.325 --> 30:31.358
I don't know.

30:31.360 --> 30:35.062
Hello? How do you drive this thing?

30:35.064 --> 30:37.400
Hello?

30:39.567 --> 30:42.369
Come aboard!

30:42.371 --> 30:47.006
So... I reckon they're out here, somewhere.

30:47.008 --> 30:50.177
Okay, let's give it a go.

30:50.179 --> 30:56.179
6128.6... that's what John and I agreed.

30:56.617 --> 31:01.021
It's almost half-past
8:00, he might be listening.

31:01.023 --> 31:04.524
Argo calling Rose Noelle. Do you read me?

31:04.526 --> 31:07.129
Your position, please. Over.

31:10.766 --> 31:12.634
<i>Argo...</i>

31:16.604 --> 31:17.940
<i>...eight degrees south.</i>

31:21.477 --> 31:27.283
Was that 28 degrees south? Please
confirm or deny, Rose Noelle. Over.

31:30.151 --> 31:33.453
<i>...south.</i>

31:33.455 --> 31:38.494
28 degrees south. I'm
sure that's what he said.

32:10.726 --> 32:11.824
Let me get up to you.

32:11.826 --> 32:13.028
What?

32:23.604 --> 32:26.073
<i>Something wasn't right.</i>

32:26.075 --> 32:30.576
<i>But I'd filled the tanks to capacity
with fresh water before we left.</i>

32:30.578 --> 32:34.246
<i>Where had it gone?</i>

32:34.248 --> 32:37.152
<i>For the first time, I had
doubts about our survival.</i>

32:54.103 --> 32:57.340
When are you going to
check the water tanks, John?

33:02.210 --> 33:03.546
John?

33:07.282 --> 33:09.052
Checked them already.

33:10.251 --> 33:12.852
And?

33:12.854 --> 33:14.289
Empty.

33:17.892 --> 33:21.628
What do you mean empty? There's no water?

33:21.630 --> 33:27.630
Hang on. So, all the water you've
been talking about, in the tanks.

33:28.237 --> 33:31.407
Thousands of liters... it's all gone?

33:33.208 --> 33:36.743
What happened to it?
Where's all the water gone?

33:36.745 --> 33:39.713
Well, it must've drained
out when we capsized.

33:39.715 --> 33:42.515
Drained out? How come?

33:42.517 --> 33:44.851
There are air vents in the tanks.

33:44.853 --> 33:47.786
Why didn't you bloody well tell us? Well?

33:47.788 --> 33:50.390
We need to stay calm.

33:50.392 --> 33:56.392
Shit! You guys have got to
face facts. We're going to die.

33:57.632 --> 34:02.835
There's no point about your stupid
mast or your stupid rationing.

34:02.837 --> 34:06.805
We've all had it! Fuck the lot of you!

34:06.807 --> 34:07.873
Phil.

34:07.875 --> 34:11.945
Oh, watch out! Jesus!

34:11.947 --> 34:13.880
Look out, the knife!

34:13.882 --> 34:17.687
Get the knife back, fuckwit!
You dropped it! You get it back!

34:20.589 --> 34:23.290
Hey, shit head, I brought a present for ya!

34:23.292 --> 34:25.625
Put these on and piss off!

34:25.627 --> 34:28.627
Eh? If we're all fucked,
why don't you swim for it?

34:28.629 --> 34:30.563
- Bye-bye, Phil!
- Bugger off!

34:30.565 --> 34:32.766
It's not my fault there's no bloody water!

34:32.768 --> 34:35.701
Rick, stop it! Come on, Rick! Enough.

34:35.703 --> 34:37.504
Fat, useless prick!

34:37.505 --> 34:39.438
Rick! Rick! Stop it!

34:39.440 --> 34:41.674
Rick! Leave him alone!

34:41.676 --> 34:44.476
Okay, I'll go down and
look for the sails now.

34:44.478 --> 34:47.480
I'll do it now, all right?
Is that good enough for you?

34:47.482 --> 34:48.949
Yeah, why have you
suddenly changed your tune?

34:48.951 --> 34:50.783
Because you're a dangerous man, Rick.

34:50.784 --> 34:54.353
Things go wrong, things don't
go your way, you throw a wobbly.

34:54.355 --> 34:57.257
You don't trust. I'll get the sails.

34:57.259 --> 34:58.625
No, no, no, I'll do it!

34:58.627 --> 35:00.493
You? Yeah, sure.

35:00.495 --> 35:02.661
No, no, no. Bad idea, Phil. I should do it.

35:02.663 --> 35:03.996
I know where they are.

35:03.998 --> 35:07.703
Well, so do I. Fuck the lot of ya'!

35:11.473 --> 35:12.741
Oh, Jesus...

35:17.879 --> 35:20.246
What if he doesn't make it?

35:20.248 --> 35:24.350
More of everything for the rest of us.

35:24.352 --> 35:28.857
You're out of line, Rick...
seriously out of line.

35:34.428 --> 35:36.298
Jesus.

35:54.283 --> 35:55.451
Fuck!

36:01.422 --> 36:06.292
<i>Rick hated to lose control. Any
setback could send him into a rage.</i>

36:06.294 --> 36:09.629
<i>He always needed someone to
blame for his predicament.</i>

36:09.631 --> 36:12.899
<i>Usually it was me, but
it could be anyone.</i>

36:12.901 --> 36:16.502
<i>It was only later I understood
what was really driving him.</i>

36:16.504 --> 36:19.474
<i>He felt he was running out of time.</i>

36:35.857 --> 36:40.326
Okay, so as you all know, the Rose Noelle
has not yet reached it's destination.

36:40.328 --> 36:43.029
Does anyone recall anything that
John Glennie might've said...

36:43.031 --> 36:45.565
about the course he was taking to Tonga?

36:45.567 --> 36:48.771
It's more than a months since they set
off. They should've arrived in Tonga by now.

37:10.125 --> 37:13.859
Hello? Rose Noelle. Come in. Do you read?

37:13.861 --> 37:17.432
Hello? Rose Noelle?

37:47.661 --> 37:50.897
Thank god. I knew it.

37:50.899 --> 37:53.966
We're gonna make it.

37:53.968 --> 37:58.740
<i>It was a sign. I knew we
were being looked after.</i>

38:17.158 --> 38:19.792
I have told you, mate.
There's no fish out here.

38:19.794 --> 38:22.661
Nothing lives this far away from land.

38:22.663 --> 38:24.062
We're in a marine desert.

38:24.064 --> 38:25.864
You've gotta try.

38:25.866 --> 38:28.967
Hey, um,... maybe we could
have our water ration now.

38:28.969 --> 38:33.007
Nope... still no sign of rain.

38:34.709 --> 38:40.045
Hey, guys... check this
out. I've been thinking.

38:40.047 --> 38:44.783
When we capsized, we
would've been about here.

38:44.785 --> 38:50.022
Prevailing current is going that way,
taking us maybe 10, 20 miles a day.

38:50.024 --> 38:56.024
So, after 34 days drifting, that
would put us right off the map.

38:56.765 --> 39:01.600
But there's nothing there...
nothing until South America.

39:01.602 --> 39:02.902
That's gonna take us...

39:02.904 --> 39:05.071
At least eight months.

39:05.073 --> 39:10.476
Possibly... or the current could take us
north along the line of the continent...

39:10.478 --> 39:12.011
but well out of the sight of land.

39:12.013 --> 39:15.084
And that would add another 1,000 miles.

39:16.551 --> 39:18.150
1,000 miles.

39:18.152 --> 39:19.955
Yeah.

39:21.890 --> 39:25.060
Just you wait. You blokes
are gonna be famous.

39:31.065 --> 39:33.799
What the fuck are you doing?

39:33.801 --> 39:35.701
You're writing your memoirs?

39:35.703 --> 39:38.971
Haven't made up my mind
up yet. Might be a book.

39:38.973 --> 39:41.140
Might be a love letter to my ex.

39:41.142 --> 39:44.980
Who? Rose Noelle? The poor bitch
you named this piece of crap after?

39:48.116 --> 39:50.216
Why did she dump you anyway?

39:50.218 --> 39:55.654
She didn't dump me. She died
in a plane crash, Pan Am 816.

39:55.656 --> 39:57.223
She was on her way to join me.

39:57.225 --> 39:59.292
Oh, yeah.

39:59.294 --> 40:05.100
Nah, there's been many women since
my sweet Rose Noelle... too many.

40:08.102 --> 40:13.105
Sure. I mean you're a real catch, hm? Sane.

40:13.107 --> 40:19.107
Handsome, young, normal, sane... sane!

40:19.647 --> 40:23.949
Rick, Rick. Let's
just... let's play a game.

40:23.951 --> 40:25.951
Sure, why not?

40:25.953 --> 40:28.120
Yeah, that's a good idea.
I'll play the winner.

40:28.122 --> 40:29.791
Piss off!

40:36.330 --> 40:39.232
You gotta take it easy on him.
I know he's annoying, but...

40:39.234 --> 40:43.672
But nothing. Count this shit up.

41:10.931 --> 41:12.535
Oh, shit!

41:47.968 --> 41:51.039
Phil? Are you gonna tell them or shall I?

41:52.973 --> 41:54.806
What?

41:54.808 --> 41:57.909
You should do that outside.

41:57.911 --> 41:59.614
It's too windy.

42:01.850 --> 42:03.652
Phil lost the rod.

42:09.357 --> 42:11.293
That was the only rig we had.

42:14.995 --> 42:18.864
First the only decent
bloody knife and now the rod.

42:18.866 --> 42:21.801
- How bloody thick are you?
- I'm sorry. Okay?

42:21.803 --> 42:27.306
No, not okay. It's everything else
about you. You're a greedy, farting pig!

42:27.308 --> 42:30.375
Look at your head, mate. You
look like you've been in a fight.

42:30.377 --> 42:33.812
When're you going to learn
how low the fucking roof is?

42:33.814 --> 42:39.351
I... I just wanna go home. I want my Karen.

42:39.353 --> 42:44.026
Phil, it's okay... it's okay.

43:25.966 --> 43:29.902
Hey, guys. Check this out.

43:29.904 --> 43:32.138
Something I've been working on.

43:32.140 --> 43:36.007
It's a collection system for water.

43:36.009 --> 43:39.745
These are PVC pipes. I've got heaps
of them in the starboard pontoon.

43:39.747 --> 43:41.313
What do you think?

43:41.315 --> 43:46.422
I don't see how you... how
are you gonna cut the pipes?

43:48.022 --> 43:52.859
Exactly. Look. How about...

43:52.861 --> 43:58.861
Why don't we use the surface
of the hull as a catchment.

44:00.100 --> 44:06.100
And we put wood along here and over here...

44:11.411 --> 44:16.350
with drain holes here and here.

44:21.321 --> 44:23.522
Yeah.

44:23.524 --> 44:28.261
Hey, hey, good on ya, mate. Hey,
now you're pulling your weight. Eh?

44:28.263 --> 44:32.000
Yeah. So, have we got any wood?

44:39.406 --> 44:43.509
- Cheers, mate.
- Yeah.

44:43.511 --> 44:49.181
<i>You can survive a long time without
food, but not without water.</i>

44:49.183 --> 44:51.551
<i>Over the weeks, we'd reduced
our rations to little more...</i>

44:51.553 --> 44:53.553
<i>than two ounces of
liquid each, per day.</i>

44:53.555 --> 44:55.855
This better bloody work.

44:55.857 --> 44:58.891
<i>But now the precious
water was almost gone.</i>

44:58.893 --> 45:04.533
<i>We were beyond thirst... suffering
the onset of dehydration.</i>

45:11.172 --> 45:13.976
- Rick.
- What's that?

45:19.147 --> 45:20.849
A boat!

45:23.618 --> 45:24.987
It's a yacht.

45:26.286 --> 45:29.554
The beacon! Quick, get the beacon!

45:29.556 --> 45:35.397
Come on! Come on! Quick. Yeah.

45:45.172 --> 45:46.973
Guys! Guys! Guys! It's too far out.

45:46.975 --> 45:49.511
They'll never see it. They'll never see it!

45:54.448 --> 45:56.982
Fuel... generator fuel!

45:56.984 --> 45:59.051
Oh, good on you, mate. Brilliant.

45:59.053 --> 46:00.556
Okay, stand back.

46:05.660 --> 46:07.428
Here, chuck it on.

46:11.632 --> 46:13.401
Come on... come on... come on!

46:15.203 --> 46:18.239
Forget it. She's gone.

46:20.540 --> 46:25.143
Yeah, a yacht like that shouldn't
be out here. It's a sign.

46:25.145 --> 46:27.413
Yeah, a sign we're not as close
to South America as you thought.

46:27.415 --> 46:32.051
No, it's a sign from
God. We're gonna be okay.

46:32.053 --> 46:36.589
Enough! Okay? No more! You're
giving me a fucking headache!

46:36.591 --> 46:39.025
Everything in life happens for a reason.

46:39.027 --> 46:42.328
That yacht is a sign,
we willed her to appear.

46:42.330 --> 46:48.330
Yeah, just like you willed that storm
to appear, eh? You're a fucking wanker!

46:49.636 --> 46:52.605
God only knows what you
know. Don't you know that?

46:52.607 --> 46:56.141
Everything comes from
within. Don't fight it.

46:56.143 --> 47:00.379
One more word... I swear one more
word and I will fucking gag you!

47:00.381 --> 47:03.015
Rick, Rick, Rick. Rick.

47:03.017 --> 47:09.017
Yeah, thank you, God, for bringing us
this far and thank you for what is to come.

47:14.962 --> 47:17.395
<i>There is still no contact
with the missing crew...</i>

47:17.397 --> 47:22.100
<i>of the Rose Noelle, which left Picton on
June the 6th with four local men on board.</i>

47:22.102 --> 47:26.538
<i>The tri-maran was expected to arrive
in Tonga by the middle of the month.</i>

47:26.540 --> 47:29.674
<i>It is now six weeks overdue.</i>

47:29.676 --> 47:35.676
<i>Following an unsuccessful search by
RNZAF Orion, pressure is now mounting...</i>

47:35.984 --> 47:40.922
<i>for a second search, despite the already
considerable expenditure of public money.</i>

48:19.694 --> 48:21.529
That's it.

48:48.489 --> 48:53.225
It's raining! Water! It's raining!

48:53.227 --> 48:55.230
Get the bottles!

49:08.241 --> 49:10.411
The bottles! Go, go, go!

49:13.214 --> 49:15.281
Oh, thank you, thank you, God!

49:15.283 --> 49:18.850
40 days in the desert... thank you.

49:18.852 --> 49:21.155
Woo! Look at this!

49:23.491 --> 49:26.294
Ah! Woo-hoo!

49:27.227 --> 49:29.728
Thank you, god!

49:29.730 --> 49:33.035
Good work... woo!

49:43.310 --> 49:46.879
They're alive. They're on their way.

49:46.881 --> 49:48.683
Home?

49:50.852 --> 49:55.620
Does Rick have a white cable-knit jersey?

49:55.622 --> 49:58.357
No.

49:58.359 --> 50:03.261
Hm, I see him in one...

50:03.263 --> 50:07.600
very nice, and gumboots...

50:07.602 --> 50:12.437
- on an island.
- Which island?

50:12.439 --> 50:18.143
I've asked the guides, but they won't
tell me... the name is two words.

50:18.145 --> 50:21.382
Five letters and seven letters.

50:23.884 --> 50:27.321
Rick's guide is here with us now.
He's standing right behind you.

50:30.491 --> 50:33.195
He's telling us they're safe.

50:44.872 --> 50:49.741
Rick, Rick, come here,
come here! Rick! Come.

50:49.743 --> 50:53.147
Ssh, fish.

50:56.484 --> 50:59.784
Oh... come to Papa.

50:59.786 --> 51:04.757
Oh, thanks to you there's no rod, no
bloody way of catching the bastard.

51:04.759 --> 51:09.865
Come on, Harry. Come on. Come on.

51:12.500 --> 51:17.772
Bugger. Nah, he'll be back.
Yeah. Don't worry. He'll be back.

51:23.410 --> 51:25.444
I think I've got something.

51:25.446 --> 51:27.382
- Oh, that's perfect.
- Yeah.

51:28.482 --> 51:30.315
- And this?
- Okay.

51:30.317 --> 51:32.417
Are we good?

51:32.419 --> 51:35.589
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're good.
We're good. That's all we need.

52:02.015 --> 52:06.620
Oh, Harry's back! Quick,
ssh! Get the net. Get the net.

52:15.663 --> 52:17.866
He's down there by the table.

52:22.703 --> 52:24.906
Come on, Harry.

52:29.542 --> 52:31.976
Slowly, mate. Slowly.

52:31.978 --> 52:34.779
Come on, Harry. Come on.

52:34.781 --> 52:35.883
Steady, Jim.

52:37.852 --> 52:41.286
He's got 'im! He's got 'im!

52:41.288 --> 52:43.455
I got him! I got him!
I got him! I'll take it.

52:43.457 --> 52:45.259
- Jesus Christ.
- Take it.

52:46.960 --> 52:47.895
Let me have him!

52:50.064 --> 52:54.902
Harry, you beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful...

53:04.678 --> 53:10.415
Oh, oh, my god.

53:10.417 --> 53:15.054
Oh, Harry, you're a top fish...

53:15.056 --> 53:20.295
and I just hope that you have
lots of mates just like you.

53:23.464 --> 53:25.763
No fish in the sea, eh, John?

53:25.765 --> 53:28.936
There will be now. They'll be
coming for the barnacles in the hull.

53:30.738 --> 53:33.504
When are you gonna check
those gas tanks, John?

53:33.506 --> 53:39.506
There's no telling how far they've corroded.
One mistake could blow us all to bits.

53:39.613 --> 53:44.449
Come on. Let's just
appreciate what we've got.

53:44.451 --> 53:47.786
We don't give thanks enough.

53:47.788 --> 53:52.357
Thank you, God, for sending us Harry.

53:52.359 --> 53:57.362
And please help John find his inner what have
you, so that we can use the bloody gas tanks.

53:57.364 --> 53:58.629
Amen.

53:58.631 --> 54:01.500
Amen.

54:01.502 --> 54:04.937
<i>Harry's friends had begun
to appear in numbers.</i>

54:04.939 --> 54:09.107
<i>After two and a half months at sea, the
Rose Noelle had become a floating reef.</i>

54:09.109 --> 54:15.109
<i>Our menu was expanding, barnacles, seaweed
and kingfish... plenty of kingfish.</i>

54:16.716 --> 54:19.820
Oi, imagine that fried.

54:22.390 --> 54:24.592
I'm not gonna give up
on the gas tanks, John.

54:32.533 --> 54:38.504
You find them... or I will.
You wouldn't like that.

54:38.506 --> 54:40.674
I might hurt your precious bloody boat.

54:46.480 --> 54:48.016
All right! All right!

55:27.053 --> 55:28.889
Okay, Jim! Turn it on.

55:35.830 --> 55:37.532
Gas coming.

55:39.700 --> 55:43.504
Shouldn't you be on your
knees, John? Praying?

55:57.183 --> 56:01.520
Oh, here we go. All right.

56:01.522 --> 56:02.855
Easy.

56:02.857 --> 56:08.493
Try 'em. One, two, three.

56:08.495 --> 56:10.127
You call those even?

56:10.129 --> 56:11.830
Yeah, who's gonna get the big one?

56:11.832 --> 56:14.098
They're all roughly the same size.

56:14.100 --> 56:15.766
Pig's ass.

56:15.768 --> 56:17.768
It's your birthday
tomorrow. Am I right, Rick?

56:17.770 --> 56:21.573
You'll get first choice.

56:21.575 --> 56:24.111
Don't worry, Phil. You
can have the biggest, mate.

56:26.913 --> 56:28.649
Cheers.

56:32.919 --> 56:35.088
Bloody beautiful.

56:39.660 --> 56:43.795
Hollow victory, isn't it?
Could've had this months ago.

56:43.797 --> 56:45.864
He knew exactly where those tanks were.

56:45.866 --> 56:49.067
We didn't have to wait all this
time to have hot, bloody food.

56:49.069 --> 56:51.303
We had to fight for everything. It's
like we're not suffering enough for him.

56:51.305 --> 56:53.871
That's true, mate. It's true.

56:53.873 --> 56:58.609
Every idea we have he scoffs at. He uses
knowledge of the boat to hold the power over us.

56:58.611 --> 57:02.813
Hey, the most important thing is
we've got gas now and hot food.

57:02.815 --> 57:04.716
How good's that?

57:04.718 --> 57:08.987
You're even starting to
sound like him. Bloody wanker.

57:08.989 --> 57:12.690
What the hell's wrong with you? He's the
one that got this whole thing rigged up.

57:12.692 --> 57:15.761
But just... just be thankful.

57:15.763 --> 57:21.763
Fuck you! Hey, why are you defending him
now, eh? Sad shit, pussy-whipped fucking yank!

57:23.136 --> 57:25.105
Hey! Hey!

57:26.739 --> 57:29.274
Guys! Jesus.

57:29.276 --> 57:31.810
Oi.

57:31.812 --> 57:34.011
<i>Despite our improving situation...</i>

57:34.013 --> 57:37.852
<i>Rick's moods were becoming
darker, more erratic.</i>

57:39.819 --> 57:42.756
<i>Not even Jim was safe
from his fits of temper.</i>

58:05.044 --> 58:06.613
Look.

58:22.763 --> 58:25.830
Look at the breast meat on him.

58:25.832 --> 58:27.801
- Roast chicken.
- Let's get him.

58:39.046 --> 58:40.714
Yes!

58:45.185 --> 58:48.189
He's got him! I got him! I got him!

58:49.823 --> 58:52.160
Come. Come on.

58:55.995 --> 59:01.995
Albatross burritos and
tomato puree... delicious.

59:03.203 --> 59:05.103
You are a bloody artist, Jim.

59:05.105 --> 59:08.172
What's supposed to happen
if you kill an albatross?

59:08.174 --> 59:12.176
The Ancient Mariner was doomed
to wander the oceans forever.

59:12.178 --> 59:15.781
The Ancient Mariner didn't fry
his, so I think we get a pass.

59:15.783 --> 59:18.652
So much food, we could have people over.

59:24.257 --> 59:26.660
Happy birthday, mate.

59:29.328 --> 59:32.998
Nice one, Rick. Keep you warm on watch.

59:33.000 --> 59:36.333
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

59:36.335 --> 59:42.335
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

59:43.009 --> 59:45.042
♪ And so say all of us ♪

59:45.044 --> 59:46.712
- Hip, hip.
- Hooray!

59:46.714 --> 59:49.183
- Hip, hip.
- Hooray!

59:50.451 --> 59:53.051
What's up, man? You all right?

59:53.053 --> 59:55.323
I couldn't have had a better birthday.

59:57.190 --> 01:00:00.761
It doesn't make sense to be happy out here.

01:00:11.105 --> 01:00:14.473
Most of us gathered here have
sailed the South Pacific...

01:00:14.475 --> 01:00:16.741
...and most of us know John Glennie.

01:00:16.743 --> 01:00:20.212
So far our requests to mount
another search have been fruitless...

01:00:20.214 --> 01:00:22.980
so it may be that we have to
find the money ourselves...

01:00:22.982 --> 01:00:27.185
some $15,000 per hour of flying time.

01:00:27.187 --> 01:00:33.187
Does anybody recall anything that
he might have said about the route?

01:00:34.527 --> 01:00:38.062
Yeah, can you tell us if you definitely
heard John's voice when you took the position?

01:00:38.064 --> 01:00:40.531
The speaker never identified himself.

01:00:40.533 --> 01:00:44.101
But you clearly heard Rose Noelle?

01:00:44.103 --> 01:00:45.536
I think so.

01:00:45.538 --> 01:00:48.774
- You're full of shit.
- Martha... please.

01:00:48.776 --> 01:00:52.042
It is only because of your lies
that they searched the Kermadecs!

01:00:52.044 --> 01:00:55.980
That was John's fourth way point.
It made sense to look for them there.

01:00:55.982 --> 01:00:57.114
Bullshit.

01:00:57.116 --> 01:00:59.086
Karen was there. She'll tell you.

01:01:01.821 --> 01:01:06.158
There was so much interference.
We could hardly hear anything.

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.361
We know nothing. That's the bloody truth!

01:01:09.363 --> 01:01:14.902
What we want is to search from
this line, 300 miles to the east.

01:01:17.103 --> 01:01:19.337
<i>Funded by friends and family...</i>

01:01:19.339 --> 01:01:22.841
<i>Another search has been mounted
for the trimaran Rose Noelle...</i>

01:01:22.843 --> 01:01:25.277
<i>missing at sea now for
nearly three months.</i>

01:01:25.279 --> 01:01:28.315
<i>20 minutes of flying time in this
direction before we turn around.</i>

01:01:59.478 --> 01:02:01.413
<i>It had taken nearly three months...</i>

01:02:01.415 --> 01:02:04.915
<i>but finally we were
beginning to work as a team.</i>

01:02:04.917 --> 01:02:08.853
<i>Each of us had a role.
We had food and water.</i>

01:02:08.855 --> 01:02:11.355
<i>We could have gone on forever.</i>

01:02:11.357 --> 01:02:17.357
♪ Farewell and adieu to
you fine Spanish ladies ♪

01:02:18.631 --> 01:02:24.631
♪ Farewell and adieu
to you ladies of Spain ♪

01:02:25.272 --> 01:02:29.908
♪ For we've received orders
to sail for old England ♪

01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:35.910
♪ And perhaps never more
shall we see you again ♪

01:02:36.015 --> 01:02:40.986
♪ Farewell and adieu
my fair Spanish ladies ♪

01:02:40.988 --> 01:02:46.527
♪ Farewell and adieu
all you ladies of Spain ♪

01:02:49.096 --> 01:02:52.900
Do you think maybe
we'll need a bigger boat?

01:03:10.149 --> 01:03:12.583
<i>There was no point in
telling the others.</i>

01:03:12.585 --> 01:03:17.991
<i>The ship was too far off to see us. It was
better to spare them the disappointment.</i>

01:03:37.944 --> 01:03:43.181
Rick! Rick! Get out here!

01:03:43.183 --> 01:03:44.449
What's up, mate?

01:03:44.451 --> 01:03:46.587
Tell me...

01:03:48.721 --> 01:03:52.192
It can't be. Surely.

01:03:53.993 --> 01:03:55.228
What is it?

01:04:04.437 --> 01:04:08.276
Christ, you bastards! That's land!

01:04:12.678 --> 01:04:14.514
That's land!

01:04:17.451 --> 01:04:19.654
Feast your eyes, John! You son of a bitch!

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:29.529
I reckon we're about ten miles out!

01:04:33.132 --> 01:04:36.603
John, you okay?

01:04:38.638 --> 01:04:41.638
John... look at it.

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:44.277
Land, it's real, mate.

01:04:51.118 --> 01:04:53.717
<i>I couldn't find words to
describe how I felt...</i>

01:04:53.719 --> 01:04:58.489
<i>relief, elation, disappointment.</i>

01:04:58.491 --> 01:05:03.761
<i>I just knew it was coming to
an end, whatever that meant.</i>

01:05:03.763 --> 01:05:08.736
<i>Perhaps that was what I was
afraid of. I didn't know.</i>

01:05:18.544 --> 01:05:21.478
<i>The others were looking forward
to lives they could return to.</i>

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:24.049
Smile for the camera.

01:05:24.051 --> 01:05:28.453
<i>But my life was here, with what
was left of my ruined Rose Noelle.</i>

01:05:28.455 --> 01:05:31.424
<i>I had nowhere else to go.</i>

01:05:37.663 --> 01:05:40.330
You know, we should have the record by now.

01:05:40.332 --> 01:05:43.167
Record? What record?

01:05:43.169 --> 01:05:46.337
119 days in an overturned boat.

01:05:46.339 --> 01:05:48.640
It's gotta be some kind of record.

01:05:48.642 --> 01:05:50.542
Jesus, John! Who gives a toss?

01:05:50.544 --> 01:05:52.643
I told you. You blokes are gonna be famous.

01:05:52.645 --> 01:05:54.645
Let's concentrate on getting on land first.

01:05:54.647 --> 01:05:56.815
Yeah, I just want to get
back to Karen and the kids.

01:05:56.817 --> 01:05:58.419
That'll do me.

01:06:01.321 --> 01:06:04.089
Yeah, mate. Can't be.

01:06:04.091 --> 01:06:06.491
What? What can't be?

01:06:06.493 --> 01:06:10.094
When I was a kid, we used to go
on holiday on Great Barrier Island.

01:06:10.096 --> 01:06:11.663
Ah-ha.

01:06:11.665 --> 01:06:14.232
- See that peak?
- Yeah.

01:06:14.234 --> 01:06:18.670
That looks like Hirakimata...
the mountain on the Barrier.

01:06:18.672 --> 01:06:22.473
Well, all mountains look pretty
much the same from a distance.

01:06:22.475 --> 01:06:24.708
I worked it out and it must
be an island off South America.

01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:27.478
Nah, Hirakimata. Mount
Hobson. I reckon that's it.

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:29.279
Well, how could that be possible.

01:06:29.281 --> 01:06:32.516
We've drifted thousands of
miles in the other direction.

01:06:32.518 --> 01:06:34.055
You might be wrong.

01:06:43.897 --> 01:06:46.830
<i>Making landfall is always dangerous.</i>

01:06:46.832 --> 01:06:49.634
<i>The ocean striking a
land mass can produce...</i>

01:06:49.636 --> 01:06:55.636
<i>a short, confused seaway, conflicting wind
and currents draw you in like a magnet.</i>

01:07:00.846 --> 01:07:02.813
John... Christ sake, put it on!

01:07:02.815 --> 01:07:04.516
There's no need.

01:07:04.518 --> 01:07:07.154
No more bullshit. Put the bloody thing on.

01:07:10.890 --> 01:07:13.591
<i>We could almost touch the land...</i>

01:07:13.593 --> 01:07:18.332
<i>but having no way of steering Rose Noelle, we
were in danger of being cast onto the rocks.</i>

01:07:21.667 --> 01:07:23.268
What was that?

01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:26.538
Must be the mast... hitting the seabed.

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:29.239
<i>If the mast were driven
up through the hull...</i>

01:07:29.241 --> 01:07:32.377
<i>Rose Noelle could break apart
and throw us into the sea.</i>

01:07:32.379 --> 01:07:33.911
We've got to get off the boat.

01:07:33.913 --> 01:07:35.946
We'll be all right, guys.
We're being looked after.

01:07:35.948 --> 01:07:37.651
Fuck that, I'm gonna swim for it.

01:07:39.819 --> 01:07:41.719
I'm with you, mate.

01:07:41.721 --> 01:07:44.425
Too dangerous, mate. Just
over there, you'll be fine.

01:07:49.361 --> 01:07:50.627
John! John!

01:07:50.629 --> 01:07:52.397
There's a bloody shark!

01:07:52.399 --> 01:07:55.799
Swim for the boat, John! There's a shark.

01:07:55.801 --> 01:07:57.301
Swim!

01:07:57.303 --> 01:07:59.737
No, no, no. One more go. One more go.

01:07:59.739 --> 01:08:02.143
Come on, mate! Swim!

01:08:09.683 --> 01:08:10.815
Come on, John!

01:08:10.817 --> 01:08:12.419
Hold on! We've got it!

01:08:21.694 --> 01:08:24.295
<i>I was done, exhausted...</i>

01:08:24.296 --> 01:08:27.932
<i>but apart from a blow to the head
and a twisted knee, I was okay.</i>

01:08:27.934 --> 01:08:30.968
Thanks.

01:08:30.970 --> 01:08:34.270
<i>In the end, after months
of constant danger...</i>

01:08:34.273 --> 01:08:38.377
<i>enduring storm and tempest, we
just drifted gently to shore.</i>

01:08:40.647 --> 01:08:42.981
<i>And when Rose Noelle could
take us no further...</i>

01:08:42.983 --> 01:08:47.587
<i>we slipped into the water
and waded to dry land.</i>

01:09:08.608 --> 01:09:11.845
What are you doing, John? Praying?

01:09:19.385 --> 01:09:21.685
You blokes didn't have to worry.

01:09:21.688 --> 01:09:26.993
We were always going to make
it. We should give thanks.

01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:35.799
Let's just be thankful we made
it, mate, eh? That's enough.

01:09:35.801 --> 01:09:38.938
Course, we did. What did I tell you?

01:09:41.541 --> 01:09:46.013
Dry land... beautiful.

01:09:49.849 --> 01:09:54.989
We were never in any danger...
not once... thanks to you.

01:09:58.023 --> 01:10:01.661
What about the sail bag? Can anyone see it?

01:10:06.933 --> 01:10:08.902
Let's go.

01:10:10.836 --> 01:10:13.040
John, we're off, mate.

01:10:21.715 --> 01:10:27.017
John... tell me that's
not a pohutakawa tree.

01:10:27.019 --> 01:10:30.456
Toitoi... definitely New Zealand.

01:10:39.532 --> 01:10:42.770
This way, guys. Looks like a track.

01:11:01.653 --> 01:11:03.523
Oh, my god.

01:11:22.007 --> 01:11:24.508
Hello? Hello?

01:11:24.510 --> 01:11:26.878
It's locked. What do we do? Break a window?

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:29.583
No, no, no, no. There'll be
a key. There's always a key.

01:11:52.471 --> 01:11:55.442
My god, a chair.

01:11:56.975 --> 01:11:58.911
- All right.
- I got the peaches.

01:12:07.886 --> 01:12:09.456
Not connected.

01:12:12.858 --> 01:12:17.561
<i>I must have been in shock. Inside
a real house after so long.</i>

01:12:17.563 --> 01:12:19.530
Still think we're in South America, mate?

01:12:19.532 --> 01:12:21.168
Jesus Christ.

01:12:25.971 --> 01:12:29.941
<i>I couldn't join the
party; the feeding frenzy.</i>

01:12:29.943 --> 01:12:31.512
What do you want?

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.981
<i>All I could think of was
my poor Rose Noelle...</i>

01:12:36.983 --> 01:12:39.484
<i>drifting helpless in the bay.</i>

01:12:39.486 --> 01:12:44.757
<i>I wanted to return to her, but
I didn't have the strength.</i>

01:12:57.036 --> 01:12:58.268
Fuck.

01:12:58.270 --> 01:13:00.103
Top up there, mate?

01:13:00.105 --> 01:13:02.643
Oh, thank you, mate.

01:13:03.742 --> 01:13:05.044
Cheers.

01:13:10.015 --> 01:13:11.816
What are you up to, buddy?

01:13:11.818 --> 01:13:14.785
Chopped sizzlers.

01:13:14.787 --> 01:13:16.219
Need a hand?

01:13:16.221 --> 01:13:20.124
No. I'm good, I'm really good.

01:13:20.126 --> 01:13:22.026
Here. Cheers.

01:13:22.028 --> 01:13:23.630
Cheers.

01:13:28.902 --> 01:13:34.902
Look at this feast, this house.
We are four, bloody, lucky guys.

01:13:36.175 --> 01:13:38.245
Yes, we are.

01:13:40.279 --> 01:13:42.312
A toast...

01:13:42.314 --> 01:13:46.182
Tomorrow, with any luck, we find
a phone and we get off this island.

01:13:46.184 --> 01:13:52.184
It's very unlikely the four of us will
ever be alone again. Well, not like this.

01:13:52.925 --> 01:13:56.960
John, I want to thank you
for getting us through this.

01:13:56.962 --> 01:14:02.035
It's because of you, the Rose Noelle
was a bountiful mother to us all.

01:14:03.803 --> 01:14:06.137
To John.

01:14:06.139 --> 01:14:08.338
John.

01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:13.343
I don't know why you were so certain
that we were going to be saved.

01:14:13.345 --> 01:14:19.345
And please spare us any more
of your crackpot theories.

01:14:19.818 --> 01:14:25.818
Although it's hard to admit, I...
I guess you were right... in the end.

01:14:27.993 --> 01:14:29.595
Cheers.

01:14:31.697 --> 01:14:37.697
But, I love you guys... and I hope...

01:14:39.772 --> 01:14:45.772
I hope that after all we've been
through, we can remain friends.

01:14:47.813 --> 01:14:51.348
Famous friends. They'll give us all medals.

01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:54.352
Yeah, to friends.

01:14:54.354 --> 01:14:56.156
Oh, pudding!

01:15:33.326 --> 01:15:37.061
Can't sleep.

01:15:37.063 --> 01:15:38.632
How's your head?

01:15:39.799 --> 01:15:41.902
It hurts.

01:16:15.134 --> 01:16:17.069
Yeah, yeah.

01:16:28.781 --> 01:16:30.884
Can I help you, blokes?

01:16:33.385 --> 01:16:34.951
Who the hell are you?

01:16:34.953 --> 01:16:36.352
And what are you doing in Jim's house?

01:16:36.354 --> 01:16:37.857
Where are we?

01:16:38.957 --> 01:16:40.825
What do you mean?

01:16:40.827 --> 01:16:42.896
Great Barrier Island.

01:16:48.934 --> 01:16:51.267
Hey, what's going on here? Who are you?

01:16:51.269 --> 01:16:53.773
We're the crew from the Rose Noelle.

01:16:55.407 --> 01:16:58.409
That trimaran that went missing?

01:16:58.411 --> 01:17:00.413
That's right.

01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:08.689
No... you guys are supposed to be dead.

01:17:10.355 --> 01:17:12.725
Really good to see ya'.

01:17:24.069 --> 01:17:26.337
A few hundred meters
either side of that cove...

01:17:26.339 --> 01:17:29.373
I would've been filling in a
report about four dead bodies.

01:17:29.375 --> 01:17:31.976
No chance.

01:17:31.978 --> 01:17:33.246
There you go, mate.

01:17:37.183 --> 01:17:39.316
Hello?

01:17:39.318 --> 01:17:41.051
<i>Hi, can I speak to Heather, please.</i>

01:17:41.053 --> 01:17:43.119
Speaking.

01:17:43.121 --> 01:17:44.954
Rick?

01:17:44.956 --> 01:17:46.524
<i>- Yeah.
- Rick?</i>

01:17:46.526 --> 01:17:50.229
It's me. Sorry, love,
I didn't recognise you.

01:17:52.031 --> 01:17:53.429
<i>Are you there?</i>

01:17:53.431 --> 01:17:56.267
Oh, g... oh, god, sorry...
yes, oh, darling...

01:17:56.269 --> 01:18:00.337
<i>I don't believe it's
true. It's really you.</i>

01:18:00.339 --> 01:18:04.941
Yeah, it's me. Um, look,
we're on Great Barrier Island.

01:18:04.943 --> 01:18:08.344
We're heading into Auckland soon. Get the
first flight you can, eh? You and Mattie?

01:18:08.346 --> 01:18:09.879
<i>Yes, I will.</i>

01:18:09.881 --> 01:18:12.182
Oh, darling, I love
you, love you, love you!

01:18:12.184 --> 01:18:17.823
Mattie, Mattie, it's
daddy! Yeah, oh, darling...

01:18:19.392 --> 01:18:20.492
See you soon, okay?

01:18:22.361 --> 01:18:23.526
Port of departure?

01:18:23.528 --> 01:18:25.331
Picton.

01:18:33.238 --> 01:18:34.940
Date of capsize.

01:18:41.913 --> 01:18:45.518
<i>- Hello?
- Martha? It's me.</i>

01:18:47.486 --> 01:18:48.552
Are you there?

01:18:48.554 --> 01:18:50.320
Yes, of course, I am.

01:18:50.322 --> 01:18:51.989
<i>They're flying us to Auckland.</i>

01:18:51.991 --> 01:18:55.058
<i>Can you please get on a plane...</i>

01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:57.330
and meet me there?

01:18:59.064 --> 01:19:00.364
Please, Martha?

01:19:00.366 --> 01:19:02.633
Okay.

01:19:02.635 --> 01:19:04.938
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

01:19:09.207 --> 01:19:11.374
That was a first.

01:19:11.376 --> 01:19:15.047
Okay, you mentioned sightings of a freight?

01:19:20.252 --> 01:19:22.554
Listen. Hey, hey, hey.

01:19:24.322 --> 01:19:25.990
<i>Ohh, oh, my baby.</i>

01:19:25.992 --> 01:19:29.062
Yeah, Snookie Pooh... it's Snuggle Beard.

01:19:31.630 --> 01:19:34.097
- Oh, my god!
- Hey, babe. Jeez, I missed you.

01:19:34.099 --> 01:19:35.932
<i>I love you so much! I'm so glad!</i>

01:19:35.934 --> 01:19:38.134
Yeah, I know. I really missed you.

01:19:38.136 --> 01:19:40.905
Yeah, well, you should
get a... Get a plane.

01:19:40.907 --> 01:19:43.140
Yeah, get a plane to
Auckland as soon as you can.

01:19:43.142 --> 01:19:45.109
<i>- Yeah.
- I love you so much.</i>

01:19:45.111 --> 01:19:47.147
Bye.

01:19:48.546 --> 01:19:50.183
Oh.

01:19:51.384 --> 01:19:55.451
John, your turn.

01:19:55.453 --> 01:19:57.623
No.

01:20:29.388 --> 01:20:31.422
Did you have any doubts that you'd make it?

01:20:31.424 --> 01:20:33.723
- Not one.
- Why's that?

01:20:33.725 --> 01:20:37.397
Faith... abiding faith.

01:20:42.401 --> 01:20:44.435
- Mr. Glennie, I presume?
- Ah, yeah.

01:20:44.437 --> 01:20:48.539
Ross Laing, Marine Transport
Division. This is Captain McKinley.

01:20:48.541 --> 01:20:50.374
Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?

01:20:50.376 --> 01:20:51.607
No.

01:20:51.609 --> 01:20:54.143
Did you keep a log book, Mr. Glennie?

01:20:54.145 --> 01:20:56.312
Yeah.

01:20:56.314 --> 01:20:58.147
Any idea where it is now?

01:20:58.149 --> 01:21:00.284
<i>This was so unexpected.</i>

01:21:00.286 --> 01:21:02.719
Are you serious? Christ! Can't this wait?

01:21:02.721 --> 01:21:05.990
If you want us to believe your story,
Mr. Glennie, you'd better co-operate.

01:21:05.992 --> 01:21:08.025
<i>After all we'd been through.</i>

01:21:08.027 --> 01:21:11.096
What did you do for food and water all
the time you were supposedly adrift?

01:21:12.098 --> 01:21:13.262
Um...

01:21:13.264 --> 01:21:14.401
Rick?

01:21:16.068 --> 01:21:18.102
Oh, Rick, darling.

01:21:18.104 --> 01:21:21.070
Oh, darling.

01:21:21.072 --> 01:21:24.040
<i>I struggled to comprehend
how we could have survived...</i>

01:21:24.042 --> 01:21:26.509
<i>so much and yet be and
treated with such suspicion.</i>

01:21:26.511 --> 01:21:29.713
I don't know what these men
have been doing for 119 days...

01:21:29.715 --> 01:21:32.149
but they haven't been
drifting on the ocean.

01:21:32.151 --> 01:21:34.084
<i>And it was only the beginning.</i>

01:21:34.086 --> 01:21:38.254
<i>We had no inkling of what
we were about to walk into.</i>

01:21:38.256 --> 01:21:40.559
<i>No one would believe us.</i>

01:21:45.531 --> 01:21:49.799
Damn it! Mattie, please?

01:21:49.801 --> 01:21:52.468
Ssh...

01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:55.172
<i>Many people are wondering, what
power and spirit they had...</i>

01:21:55.174 --> 01:21:58.208
<i>these four men who spent July, August and
September adrift on the Pacific Ocean.</i>

01:21:58.210 --> 01:22:00.811
<i>Ministry of Transport officials...</i>

01:22:00.813 --> 01:22:04.347
<i>are to retrace the 119-day voyage of the
Rose Noelle with the use of a computer.</i>

01:22:04.349 --> 01:22:06.784
<i>They look too good to be true.</i>

01:22:06.786 --> 01:22:09.419
<i>I mean no salt sores, far too well fed,
what did they eat out there all that time?</i>

01:22:09.421 --> 01:22:11.789
<i>Who the hell do they
think they're kidding?</i>

01:22:11.791 --> 01:22:14.191
<i>Bloody drug smugglers, I reckon. They're
having us on and it's all bull...</i>

01:22:14.193 --> 01:22:16.459
<i>I don't believe a word of it.</i>

01:22:16.461 --> 01:22:19.463
<i>How can they be floating around for
so long without someone seeing them?</i>

01:22:19.465 --> 01:22:22.066
<i>It's just impossible. It's just...</i>

01:22:22.068 --> 01:22:23.734
<i>Okay, mate. It's just
not humanly possible.</i>

01:22:23.736 --> 01:22:25.668
<i>I know what conditions are
like that time of year.</i>

01:22:25.670 --> 01:22:28.806
<i>No yacht's gonna stay afloat
for even half that time, mate.</i>

01:22:28.808 --> 01:22:33.177
<i>Amid the euphoria, relief and sheer
joy at the survival of the crew...</i>

01:22:33.179 --> 01:22:35.712
<i>some serious questions arise.</i>

01:22:35.714 --> 01:22:39.450
<i>The Transport Minister has asked
for a preliminary investigation...</i>

01:22:39.452 --> 01:22:43.219
<i>into the crew members' claims
of the 120-day ordeal...</i>

01:22:43.221 --> 01:22:45.655
<i>which has attracted
widespread scepticism.</i>

01:22:45.657 --> 01:22:49.426
<i>So what do you say, John,
in response to those...</i>

01:22:49.428 --> 01:22:53.463
who don't believe you? Is
there an alternative story?

01:22:53.465 --> 01:22:58.435
You know, I... I couldn't give
a stuff what anybody thinks.

01:22:58.437 --> 01:23:01.437
Jim, check it out. John's on the tele.

01:23:01.439 --> 01:23:04.240
<i>We were adrift all that time.</i>

01:23:04.242 --> 01:23:10.242
<i>Survived only because we were careful
and clever and looked after each other.</i>

01:23:10.782 --> 01:23:16.686
<i>For the rest of my life, I'll be
grateful to Phil and Rick and Jim.</i>

01:23:16.688 --> 01:23:21.391
<i>Under the circumstances, they were
the best men I could have hoped for.</i>

01:23:21.393 --> 01:23:26.597
<i>If you're watching
this, guys, I thank you.</i>

01:23:26.599 --> 01:23:29.665
<i>We needed a miracle and we got one.</i>

01:23:29.667 --> 01:23:32.436
<i>Skipper John Glennie claims his yacht was
capsized by a huge wave 3 days into their voyage.</i>

01:23:32.438 --> 01:23:34.504
Ah, bullshit.

01:23:34.506 --> 01:23:36.272
No, no, babe. Hey, it's all right.

01:23:36.274 --> 01:23:38.709
<i>But now after surviving...</i>

01:23:38.711 --> 01:23:43.813
<i>119 days drifting at sea, the Rose
Noelle broke up in a storm yesterday.</i>

01:23:43.815 --> 01:23:47.517
<i>Mr. Glennie returned to the
wreck yesterday by helicopter...</i>

01:23:47.519 --> 01:23:51.722
<i>accompanied by marine division investigators
who are trying to piece together...</i>

01:23:51.724 --> 01:23:53.891
<i>the final voyage of the Rose Noelle.</i>

01:23:53.893 --> 01:23:56.392
Empty.

01:23:56.394 --> 01:24:00.329
Do you wanna have a look at this?

01:24:00.331 --> 01:24:01.567
I might've been wrong.

01:24:04.336 --> 01:24:08.371
<i>It's perhaps New Zealand's most
miraculous survival story ever.</i>

01:24:08.373 --> 01:24:12.910
<i>How four men in an upturned boat could
drift on the high seas without trace...</i>

01:24:12.912 --> 01:24:16.914
<i>for nearly four months and
live to tell the story.</i>

01:24:16.916 --> 01:24:22.352
<i>So remarkable was their tale of survival, that
some began to doubt that it ever happened.</i>

01:24:22.354 --> 01:24:26.923
<i>But a report released today
backs up the incredible saga.</i>

01:24:26.925 --> 01:24:30.793
<i>This inquiry with detailed
scientific evidence...</i>

01:24:30.795 --> 01:24:35.531
<i>supporting it has demonstrated
that this is absolutely true...</i>

01:24:35.533 --> 01:24:39.436
<i>and it is in fact is one of the great
stories of human survival on the seas.</i>

01:24:39.438 --> 01:24:44.473
<i>The Rose Noelle skipper, John Glennie,
describes the report as fair and thorough.</i>

01:24:44.475 --> 01:24:49.780
<i>Glennie says it answers
the doubts some people had.</i>

01:24:49.782 --> 01:24:55.285
<i>Sadly, eight months after our
return, Rick died of a brain tumor.</i>

01:24:55.287 --> 01:24:58.754
<i>Jim helped take care of him
and then trained as a nurse.</i>

01:24:58.756 --> 01:25:01.290
<i>Phil went back to sea.</i>

01:25:01.292 --> 01:25:05.529
<i>He even made several voyages across
the Pacific and fathered another child.</i>

01:25:05.531 --> 01:25:09.732
<i>But despite the ordeal we had
survived so well together...</i>

01:25:09.734 --> 01:25:15.575
<i>after we left the island, I never
saw Rick, Jim or Phil ever again.</i>
