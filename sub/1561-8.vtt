[church bell dinging]

00:19.853 --> 00:22.231
[speaking in Spanish]

00:31.698 --> 00:33.325
- Anne Marie?
- Shh.

00:35.410 --> 00:36.912
Did you find it?

00:38.622 --> 00:41.216
- I had to bribe the janitor.
- Thanks.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.293
I can handle labor
but not sugar withdrawal.

00:43.502 --> 00:44.970
[chuckles]

00:47.089 --> 00:48.341
Sleep tight.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.222
Thank you.

00:52.302 --> 00:54.179
Diego.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.267
You're perfect.

00:59.351 --> 01:01.149
[music continues]

01:01.353 --> 01:03.151
[indistinct chatter]

01:03.355 --> 01:06.734
I forgot to ask her
for a glass of water.

01:06.942 --> 01:08.660
I'll get you one.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.203
[speaking in Spanish]

01:13.657 --> 01:16.536
[eerie music]

[wings fluttering]

01:34.261 --> 01:36.013
[screams]

01:36.221 --> 01:40.146
Oh, my goodness, Sister Luisa!
I'm so sorry.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.398
I was on my rounds
and I keep hearing this..

01:42.603 --> 01:44.230
The mice?

01:44.438 --> 01:45.530
It's this old convent.

01:45.731 --> 01:48.200
I still get scared
walking alone at night.

01:49.901 --> 01:51.778
Good night, Sister Anne Marie.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.455
Good night.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.710
[music continues]

02:00.912 --> 02:02.789
[baby cooing]

02:09.086 --> 02:11.931
Hugo?

02:12.132 --> 02:13.975
[screaming]

02:17.971 --> 02:19.973
Martina!

02:20.140 --> 02:23.019
No. No. No! No!
No! Martina! Martina!

02:23.226 --> 02:25.820
[crying]

02:26.021 --> 02:29.025
Martina! Martina..

02:29.232 --> 02:31.326
No!

02:32.611 --> 02:35.490
[theme music]

02:57.469 --> 02:59.346
Tea.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.857
Hmm.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.985
Bit traditional for my taste.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.362
But glad to see
your strength's coming back.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.872
- Oi.
- Hey!

03:18.073 --> 03:19.791
Does it feel good?

03:19.991 --> 03:20.992
Being back at it?

03:21.201 --> 03:23.124
[exhales] Yes and no.

03:23.328 --> 03:25.080
I've been having nightmares
about this stuff.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.711
It's all I've been able to see
since we got back from Kentucky.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.543
Well, there's no mystery there.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.219
You touch an angel's heart,
you get a blast

03:31.420 --> 03:32.717
from the Old Testament.

03:32.921 --> 03:35.219
You're seeing things
that winged menace used to see.

03:35.424 --> 03:37.643
I thought so, too.
Until I drew this.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.095
Hm.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.063
[spooky music]

03:44.015 --> 03:46.859
This twisty little
horror show's an lnvunche.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.439
And it's right up
that angel's alley.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.775
Must've missed that story
in Sunday school.

03:52.983 --> 03:55.031
Invunche don't get
a shout out in the Good Book

03:55.235 --> 03:57.408
but they ripped a few throats
back in Noah's day.

03:57.612 --> 04:00.161
Believe me. Nasty bastards.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.787
'Unstoppable.'

04:01.992 --> 04:04.165
Luckily they all went out
with the last flood.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.212
Give the history lesson
a break, eh?

04:06.413 --> 04:08.882
Do the bloody crossword
or something.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.550
[chuckles]

04:17.298 --> 04:18.926
[sighs]

04:20.635 --> 04:23.388
I'm sorry. I didn't know
John had a visitor.

04:23.597 --> 04:26.066
Where is he? I need him.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.360
John, did you forget someone?

04:28.560 --> 04:30.358
- My name is Zed by the way.
- I need him now.

04:30.562 --> 04:32.064
Well, clearly.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.274
John! John Constantine!

04:34.483 --> 04:36.577
Oh, geez. Good God, woman!

04:36.777 --> 04:38.370
I'm not deaf, alright?
I can hear you.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.413
Keep your bloody knickers on.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.667
Anne Marie?

04:44.868 --> 04:46.120
Are you alright?

04:48.121 --> 04:49.839
Would I come to you
if I was alright?

04:51.666 --> 04:54.215
- You didn't know she was here?
- She isn't. Where are you?

04:54.419 --> 04:56.842
Mexico. I need your help.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.799
- Are you hurt?
- No.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.635
Something stole a baby.
It killed the mother.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.345
'It ripped into her.'

05:03.553 --> 05:05.976
Hey.

05:06.181 --> 05:07.398
What just happened?

05:07.599 --> 05:08.725
Well, I told you she's not here.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.732
"Ripped" how? Teeth or claws?

05:10.936 --> 05:13.985
- This thing have fangs? Fur?
- I don't know.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.941
Then how do you know there's
not a mortal explanation?

05:18.401 --> 05:20.995
[eerie music]

05:21.196 --> 05:22.948
I wish it had been human.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.705
I would've gone
to someone else for help.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.001
Anyone else.

05:27.202 --> 05:28.499
And what's stopping you?

05:28.662 --> 05:30.960
There's plenty of occult experts
in Mexico.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.462
They don't owe me.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.010
You do.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.212
Avenue Nueva 366.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.842
Villa del Carban.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.549
Hurry.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.304
[intense music]

05:43.885 --> 05:45.762
Avenue Nueva 366..

05:45.971 --> 05:47.564
What just happened?

05:47.764 --> 05:49.892
It's called bi-location.

05:50.100 --> 05:53.024
'The power to be in
two places at the same time.'

05:53.228 --> 05:54.821
'It's the domain of
adventurous souls'

05:55.021 --> 05:56.944
'and the occasional saint which'

05:57.148 --> 05:59.401
'Anne Marie Flynn
most certainly isn't.'

06:00.902 --> 06:02.529
She hates my guts.

06:02.737 --> 06:05.115
Must be pretty sodding desperate
to be coming to me for help.

06:05.323 --> 06:06.449
[dramatic music]

06:06.658 --> 06:08.501
[baby crying]

06:25.802 --> 06:27.349
[instrumental music]

06:29.472 --> 06:31.691
Ow! Bollocks!

06:31.892 --> 06:33.189
You should use a spoon.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.645
[sighs]

06:34.853 --> 06:36.400
Making a purification bowl.

06:36.605 --> 06:38.858
Left my last good one
in Puerto Rico.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.033
Does the work of a priest.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.111
Turns water holy.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.414
Well, you know, I could probably

06:45.614 --> 06:47.708
put it in my carry-on
if you need some space.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.411
Well, that would be lovely
if you were going with.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.087
But you're still on R and R.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.548
You're that concerned about me?

06:55.749 --> 06:57.717
That's why I'm letting you
crash here.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.511
I'll turn the traps on
on my way out.

06:59.711 --> 07:02.339
The house will keep you safe
as long as you don't leave it.

07:02.547 --> 07:06.597
Okay. ljust have,
you know, one more question.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.303
[speaking in Spanish]

07:09.971 --> 07:11.894
I..

07:12.098 --> 07:14.317
You're seriously not taking
the Spanish speaker?

07:14.517 --> 07:17.896
I'm seriously not going there
for a conversation.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.321
Ah-ha!

07:19.522 --> 07:21.365
So, she is an old flame.

07:23.568 --> 07:27.948
We slept together, once,
if that's what you're after.

07:28.156 --> 07:30.500
'Never should have though.
Wasn't the point of us.'

07:34.079 --> 07:36.798
Magic was my salvation
growing up and..

07:36.998 --> 07:39.717
She hooked me up
in the occult scene.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.465
Is that why you "owe" her?

07:42.921 --> 07:44.969
No.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.641
She was with me at Newcastle.

07:48.927 --> 07:50.929
She saw what happened.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.686
Just like Gary.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.564
Swore she'd kill me
if she ever saw me again.

07:56.768 --> 07:59.897
I'd rather play this one out
in private, if you don't mind.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.117
Sounds like Chas.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.534
So much for privacy, huh?

08:05.735 --> 08:07.578
Ah, don't take it
personally, luv.

08:07.779 --> 08:09.497
Chas and I, we go way back.

08:09.698 --> 08:11.291
Remember, stay inside.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.789
And, uh, don't go wandering.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.042
[instrumental music]

08:33.221 --> 08:35.063
Did you know we were coming
to a convent?

08:35.265 --> 08:36.938
It's one gory detail
she left out.

08:39.561 --> 08:41.438
[indistinct chattering]

08:44.024 --> 08:46.118
[speaking in Spanish]

08:49.738 --> 08:52.457
- You should have brought Zed.
- Don't you bloody start on me.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.910
Uh, excuse me, luv, you don't
happen to know a British girl

08:55.118 --> 08:56.791
by the name
of Anne Marie Flynn, do you?

08:56.995 --> 08:59.043
Fairly pretty, brunette.
She kind of got this..

09:01.833 --> 09:03.380
Annie?

09:03.585 --> 09:06.134
[speaking in Spanish]

09:06.337 --> 09:08.510
Uh, it's great to see you.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.092
John didn't need to
drag you into this.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.553
I should've told him
to come alone.

09:12.761 --> 09:15.480
That's another thing you
should've told me..

09:15.680 --> 09:17.808
Sister.

09:18.016 --> 09:19.814
We can't talk here.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.486
[music continues]

09:27.317 --> 09:29.740
The police outside work for
the man whose wife was murdered.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.617
They questioned everyone
who was here last night.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.040
No one saw anything.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.083
By the look of the burn
on your chest

09:36.284 --> 09:39.504
we're not looking for
a... human suspect.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.207
It's gonna take more than an
interrogation to find out what.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.837
The police will be leaving
for the funeral soon.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.794
You'll have an hour
to look around.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.800
Oh, come on, luv.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.847
You're skipping
all the juicy parts.

09:51.549 --> 09:54.018
No, I told you
exactly what I saw.

09:54.219 --> 09:55.892
You can't just sit there
in a bloody nun's habit

09:56.096 --> 09:58.519
and pretend we don't have
nothing to cover.

09:58.723 --> 10:01.192
I always figured that one
of us would flee to Mexico

10:01.392 --> 10:04.737
but I thought
there'd be tequila involved.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.406
Or skinny-dipping.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.534
More jokes.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.156
That's incredible.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.705
What happened to Astra
didn't change you at all.

10:16.699 --> 10:19.543
- Easy, Annie.
- Don't call me that.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.872
I don't know how you do it
but my soul can't take

10:22.080 --> 10:24.174
another lost child.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.593
'I took a vow of service
to repent for my sins'

10:26.793 --> 10:28.340
during that seance.

10:28.545 --> 10:29.922
What about you?

10:31.464 --> 10:33.057
Just because I'm not hiding
in a nunnery

10:33.258 --> 10:35.431
don't mean I ignore my debts.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.723
Sometimes I even fly to
Mexico on a moment's notice

10:39.931 --> 10:41.478
to very little thanks.

10:41.683 --> 10:44.607
Thanks?
Oh, is that why you're here?

10:44.811 --> 10:46.438
'I'm fresh out
but you should try the others.'

10:46.646 --> 10:49.866
Ritchie, Gary, Judith..

10:50.066 --> 10:55.323
Have they called you
with their gratitude?

10:55.530 --> 10:58.579
There's no point reeling
in the years, now, is there?

10:58.783 --> 11:00.877
We need to figure out
what kind of demonic killer

11:01.077 --> 11:03.705
walks into the house of God
without breaking a sweat.

11:05.874 --> 11:08.548
[intense music]

11:08.751 --> 11:10.298
[wood creaking]

11:47.874 --> 11:50.047
Is this the only place
it attacked?

11:50.251 --> 11:51.173
Yes.

12:06.184 --> 12:09.984
- That's from the mice.
- Not necessarily.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.657
A lot of wall-dwellers
target children.

12:12.857 --> 12:15.531
Duendes, fairies..

12:15.735 --> 12:17.408
Nursery demons.

12:17.612 --> 12:19.364
Grab the table, Chas.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.621
Our first job is to narrow
down the category.

12:22.825 --> 12:26.329
Rune stones will tell us which
team our culprit plays for.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.380
[intense music]

12:32.752 --> 12:34.254
[door rattling]

12:55.483 --> 12:57.235
Oh! Uh... hello.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.241
- Can I help you?
- It's alright, Sister.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.743
- They're just here to..
- Crime scene cleanup.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.950
Yes. There's a new mother
coming in soon.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.461
Of course. Sorry to interrupt.

13:06.661 --> 13:09.289
One of the sisters saw you.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.795
She thought you were El Cuycuy.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.253
The bogeyman. Huh.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.964
And you just charged up here
with nothing but your wits.

13:18.172 --> 13:20.015
Woman after my own heart.

13:22.593 --> 13:24.140
Good luck.

13:24.345 --> 13:25.767
You, too.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.898
You can't even turn it off
around a woman married to God?

13:31.102 --> 13:34.572
What, you mean sister
flirtatious? She started it.

13:34.772 --> 13:37.116
If those cops are gonna be back
in an hour, we gotta move fast.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.241
[intense music]

13:50.955 --> 13:53.299
[exhales]

13:53.499 --> 13:55.217
Holy mother of earth

13:55.418 --> 13:57.637
mother of the higher realm

13:57.837 --> 14:00.090
guide my hand.

14:00.298 --> 14:02.392
Reveal the evil that dwelt here.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.855
What have we here?

14:11.059 --> 14:12.652
[music continues]

14:17.732 --> 14:19.405
Whatever was here
covered its tracks.

14:19.609 --> 14:22.203
Baby snackers aren't that
sophisticated. This is good.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.030
It means the kid
might still be alive.

14:24.197 --> 14:27.201
We need a link
to the child's soul.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.502
The placenta. It's buried
in their backyard.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.921
Local tradition. It's supposed
to bring good luck.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.589
Fat lot of good that did.

14:33.790 --> 14:34.837
Alright, you stay here.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.463
Watch for trouble.

14:36.667 --> 14:37.759
We've got some digging to do.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.467
'If the placenta's
really buried'

14:40.671 --> 14:42.469
'in Hugo's back yard
I can find it myself.'

14:42.673 --> 14:45.142
'One spell will tell me
if the tyke's alive.'

14:45.343 --> 14:48.222
You can wait in the
van, if you're afraid.

14:48.429 --> 14:49.305
Who said that I was afraid?

14:49.514 --> 14:50.686
Well, I figured it was that or

14:50.890 --> 14:51.982
you just took a spontaneous

14:52.183 --> 14:53.810
vow of silence on the ride over.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.565
It couldn't possibly be
that I'm focused

14:55.770 --> 14:57.522
on finding a missing baby?

14:57.730 --> 14:59.107
Or that I don't have
anything to say to you?

14:59.315 --> 15:02.068
Annie, listen..

15:02.276 --> 15:04.370
L know you don't trust me
after the seance at Newcastle.

15:04.570 --> 15:05.822
Trust?

15:06.030 --> 15:07.873
You lost that before the seance.

15:10.159 --> 15:13.163
When you left my bed and went
trawling for girls at the bar?

15:13.371 --> 15:15.419
My sheets
weren't even cold, John.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.296
Yeah. I saw you.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.296
Do you want that vow of silence
back now?

15:31.472 --> 15:34.271
[eerie music]

15:34.475 --> 15:36.318
[dogs barking in distance]

15:48.948 --> 15:51.121
I didn't mean for you
to see me that night.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.539
I'm sorry I hurt you.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.919
It's not just the sex
or the seance, John.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.126
It's... it's your ego.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.177
Everyone's just a port
in your storm.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.887
[music continues]

16:17.226 --> 16:19.320
The placenta's
definitely buried here.

16:22.857 --> 16:24.200
Is that skin?

16:24.400 --> 16:26.243
[music continues]

16:32.575 --> 16:34.293
Oh!

16:39.540 --> 16:41.042
Oh, my God!

16:43.336 --> 16:44.804
(Hugo) Manos arriba! Hands
where I can see them!

16:45.004 --> 16:46.472
Hugo, wait! It's me!

16:46.672 --> 16:47.548
Sister?

16:47.757 --> 16:49.759
What are you doing?

16:49.967 --> 16:51.014
What is that?

16:51.219 --> 16:53.187
A piece of human fruit, mate.

16:53.387 --> 16:55.685
Your baby's alive.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.563
And I know who took him.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.694
'Have another.'

17:04.898 --> 17:07.527
It won't make more sense

17:07.693 --> 17:09.444
but it will make you
more open to it.

17:11.571 --> 17:15.998
I'll be "open" to my trees
growing human flesh?

17:16.202 --> 17:18.375
The placenta is
connected to an infant's soul.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.002
"Your son's is telling us
that there's some"

17:21.207 --> 17:23.335
very dark magic surrounding him.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.136
'As old as the Garden of Eden.'

17:25.336 --> 17:27.589
Forbidden fruit,
that ring a bell?

17:27.797 --> 17:30.266
If you try and tell me that
Adam or Eve took my boy..

17:31.968 --> 17:33.811
Not Eve.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.558
One of her sisters.

17:35.763 --> 17:39.063
'They turned down Adam's'
proposal before Eve said yes.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.770
Chose an eternity
as goddesses of hell

17:41.978 --> 17:43.821
over a lifetime of obedience
on Earth.

17:45.106 --> 17:46.983
It's hard to blame 'em, really.

17:48.609 --> 17:51.112
Martina was a good Catholic.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.039
Why would God let this
happen to her, to Diego?

17:54.240 --> 17:57.164
This isn't God's work, Hugo.

17:57.368 --> 18:01.043
Evil wins when we let it destroy
our faith in the power of good.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.333
Believe me,
I know how hard it is.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.180
I've been on the force
for 14 years.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.848
Never felt so helpless.

18:12.717 --> 18:14.435
I always thought
God was listening.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.647
Ah, let the Almighty
take His time out.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.850
We got plenty to occupy
ourselves with

18:21.058 --> 18:23.436
like figuring out
which one of Eve's sisters

18:23.644 --> 18:24.770
is behind all this.

18:24.979 --> 18:26.447
[phone ringing]

18:28.232 --> 18:30.360
Now you're standing in for God.

18:30.568 --> 18:32.991
Make way for John Constantine.

18:33.195 --> 18:35.414
I'm telling a desperate man
that there are things we can do

18:35.615 --> 18:37.834
to get his son back
other than pray.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.877
Your arrogance
is out of control.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.628
It took another baby.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.210
[dramatic music]

18:54.216 --> 18:56.469
- Considering a blue period?
- Hey!

18:56.677 --> 18:58.099
- Hi.
- Eddie.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.523
Uh, sorry,
I didn't recognize you with

19:00.723 --> 19:02.316
um, your clothes on.

19:02.516 --> 19:03.563
[chuckles]

19:03.768 --> 19:05.315
What are you doing here?

19:05.519 --> 19:08.193
Well, I'm only modeling
until my art career takes off.

19:09.774 --> 19:11.492
You paint, too?

19:11.692 --> 19:13.990
I'll tell you about it
over drinks.

19:14.195 --> 19:16.038
'First round's on me?'

19:16.238 --> 19:17.535
Let me pay for these, first.

19:21.452 --> 19:23.295
[intense music]

19:30.211 --> 19:32.680
Um, I finished my MBA
three years ago.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.057
I don't know,
I can't bring myself to..

19:35.257 --> 19:37.476
Put on a tie and go to work.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.520
So you strip naked
and pose nude.

19:39.720 --> 19:40.937
Oh, yeah, it's a cry for help.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.266
[chuckling]

19:43.474 --> 19:46.273
So what about you?
How long you been studying art?

19:46.477 --> 19:48.730
- It's my first class.
- No, I don't believe that.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.690
I-I saw your sketches.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.195
[inhales]

19:52.400 --> 19:54.494
Drawing..

19:54.694 --> 19:55.991
It's like breathing to me.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.822
Hmm.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.498
I'd love to see your work.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.953
No, you wouldn't.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.377
You really wouldn't.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.084
[intense music]

20:11.293 --> 20:12.670
That beer go to your head?

20:16.549 --> 20:19.393
No. No, I..

20:19.552 --> 20:21.350
Promise I'm not that much
of a lightweight.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.227
Ah, okay.
That sounds like a challenge.

20:23.431 --> 20:25.479
Hey, why don't we do
the next round at my place?

20:27.977 --> 20:29.103
Okay.

20:31.522 --> 20:33.024
Why didn't I wake up?

20:33.232 --> 20:34.700
It's good that you didn't.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.026
'It may have saved your life.'

20:36.235 --> 20:37.327
We're going to find her.

20:37.528 --> 20:38.871
We'll start by dusting
for prints.

20:39.071 --> 20:42.041
There won't be any prints.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.039
[speaking in Spanish]

21:00.384 --> 21:02.603
Oi! So, uh..

21:02.803 --> 21:04.601
If I'm reading this right

21:04.805 --> 21:07.103
this teenager's your son

21:07.308 --> 21:10.027
and the new missing baby is..

21:10.227 --> 21:11.945
Your granddaughter.

21:12.146 --> 21:14.069
Did you piss off a Gypsy, mate?

21:14.273 --> 21:16.116
Get your whole brood cursed?

21:16.275 --> 21:17.322
[speaking in Spanish]

21:17.526 --> 21:19.574
The killer is targeting
your family.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.123
You two just, uh,
carry on catching up.

21:22.323 --> 21:24.417
I got a guilty goddess to catch.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.210
Does that fountain outside work?

21:26.410 --> 21:28.253
[dramatic music]

21:34.960 --> 21:36.212
I can't let you summon some

21:36.420 --> 21:38.093
deity from hell
on the convent grounds.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.674
I'm only casting a spell
to invoke

21:39.882 --> 21:41.099
the goddess' reflection
in the water.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.018
That way, I can put a name
to the face.

21:43.219 --> 21:45.347
And what happens when your spell
gets out of control, John?

21:45.554 --> 21:46.771
This convent's full
of innocent people.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.599
Then why did you call me?

21:48.808 --> 21:50.310
Saving lives requires choices

21:50.518 --> 21:53.442
that you're not willing to make
or I wouldn't be here.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.364
Now go and pray and let me work.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.407
[music continues]

22:01.153 --> 22:03.030
Was that really necessary?

22:14.041 --> 22:17.011
I've heard worse from him.

22:17.211 --> 22:20.761
He'd rather risk your feelings
than any other part of you.

22:20.965 --> 22:22.342
'That's how..'

22:22.550 --> 22:24.393
he deals with the pain.

22:26.220 --> 22:28.518
John has one thing
that makes his life

22:28.722 --> 22:31.191
worth a damn and he can't do it
if he lets anyone in too close.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.607
Like he did with you.

22:36.438 --> 22:37.940
[chuckles]

22:39.149 --> 22:41.197
[instrumental music]

22:44.488 --> 22:45.740
That's all.

22:47.074 --> 22:48.621
[sighs]

22:48.826 --> 22:50.669
Alright, sisters of Eve..

22:52.246 --> 22:55.716
Whichever one of you
is hanging around..

22:55.916 --> 22:58.294
It's time to reveal
your pretty mug.

22:58.502 --> 23:00.550
[intense music]

23:06.260 --> 23:11.391
[sighs]

23:11.599 --> 23:13.397
Axis mundi produco

23:13.601 --> 23:15.603
tuus vires.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.108
Axis mundi produco

23:17.313 --> 23:18.439
tuus vires.

23:18.647 --> 23:22.447
[indistinct chanting]

23:22.651 --> 23:25.279
Hola, sister, I'm, uh..

23:25.487 --> 23:27.660
Involved in
a personal prayer here

23:27.865 --> 23:29.708
if you don't mind
clearing out a sec.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.628
Uh, we need you upstairs.
Yolanda is very upset.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.250
You left everyone in confusion.

23:34.455 --> 23:36.048
Oh, you just tell them
to relax, alright?

23:36.248 --> 23:38.751
We'll get everything sorted.

23:38.959 --> 23:41.883
If you don't come with me now,
you'll be the one sorted out

23:42.087 --> 23:44.681
by Mother Superior
or the police.

23:44.882 --> 23:46.555
[music continues]

23:48.719 --> 23:50.517
It's funny, your timing here.

23:50.721 --> 23:52.268
You know,
if I didn't know better

23:52.473 --> 23:54.817
I'd say you're trying to keep me
away from this here fountain.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.520
Let's go. Now.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.732
Okay.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.284
I'll just rinse out my bowl.

24:07.071 --> 24:08.664
[eerie music]

24:13.911 --> 24:16.630
Forgive me, sister.

24:16.830 --> 24:19.083
Your name slipped my mind.

24:21.001 --> 24:22.298
Lilith, is it?

24:22.503 --> 24:23.629
Durgia.

24:23.837 --> 24:26.340
Naamah.

24:26.548 --> 24:27.925
Lamashtu.

24:28.133 --> 24:29.180
[music continues]

24:29.385 --> 24:31.012
[growling]

24:33.430 --> 24:36.775
Where are the babies?

24:36.976 --> 24:38.728
[grunting]

24:42.898 --> 24:44.616
[intense music]

24:52.199 --> 24:53.951
[grunting]

24:57.413 --> 24:59.381
[screaming]

25:10.384 --> 25:12.887
Wow. You live here by yourself?

25:13.095 --> 25:15.097
I'm house-sitting.

25:15.305 --> 25:18.184
Well, you have
very interesting friends.

25:18.392 --> 25:21.566
(Zed) Yes, I do have very
interesting friends.

25:21.770 --> 25:23.647
Whoa!

25:23.856 --> 25:25.324
- It's nice, right?
- Yeah.

25:25.524 --> 25:26.741
Yeah.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.286
[grunting]

25:36.493 --> 25:39.167
I can't wait for you to meet
them when they get home.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.215
They love interrogations.
Why are you following me?

25:44.168 --> 25:46.341
[gasping]
Your father wants you home.

25:48.797 --> 25:50.891
What did you say?

25:51.091 --> 25:54.015
We just wanna talk to you, Mary.

25:54.219 --> 25:57.063
Don't you ever, ever call me
that again!

26:00.267 --> 26:02.235
Her name isn't Louisa.

26:02.436 --> 26:04.234
It's Lamashtu.

26:04.438 --> 26:07.282
Eve's youngest sister and
a bit of a glorified vampire.

26:07.483 --> 26:10.737
I taught you about Lamashtu.
She doesn't kidnap her prey.

26:12.446 --> 26:14.039
What does she do?

26:14.239 --> 26:18.289
Lamashtu enjoys babies
for their nutritional value.

26:18.494 --> 26:21.043
'But lucky for you,
she's curbing her hunger'

26:21.246 --> 26:24.625
though I can't conceive why.
Lamashtu lives to feed.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.460
Maybe the question is
what makes Hugo's litter

26:26.668 --> 26:28.170
worth keeping alive?

26:28.378 --> 26:30.051
We're nobodies,
we're good Catholics.

26:30.255 --> 26:31.632
I've got nothing to hide
from you.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.093
Maybe someone's hiding
something from you.

26:34.301 --> 26:36.053
'And what about the rest
of your family?'

26:36.261 --> 26:38.434
- Who knows your roots?
- How about my grandmother, Pia?

26:38.639 --> 26:39.891
She was born in Chile.

26:40.099 --> 26:43.649
Great, I have a way
with older women.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.479
[chicken clucking]

26:48.107 --> 26:50.860
Thank you, abuelita.

26:51.068 --> 26:52.570
- Is that Mateo?
- No, no.

26:52.778 --> 26:54.496
I'm just a friend of Hugo's.

26:54.696 --> 26:56.664
I have some questions
about Chile.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.287
He said that you're the expert.

26:58.492 --> 27:01.120
- Chile?
- Pia, listen to me.

27:01.328 --> 27:03.547
Something is coming
after our babies.

27:03.747 --> 27:05.340
'Something inhuman.'

27:05.541 --> 27:07.214
Martina is dead, abuelita.

27:07.417 --> 27:08.919
[gasps]

27:09.128 --> 27:11.381
Why would someone be
targeting us?

27:11.588 --> 27:13.135
God help us.

27:14.842 --> 27:17.436
They are back.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.684
Who is, Mrs. Lopez?

27:19.888 --> 27:22.767
La Brujeria.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.979
La Brujeria.

27:26.186 --> 27:28.188
They are tracking us down.

27:28.397 --> 27:30.070
Gathering new blood.

27:30.274 --> 27:32.447
I've never heard of La Brujeria.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.780
They were powerful warlocks in
Chile long before it was Chile.

27:35.988 --> 27:38.116
It's prehistoric stuff
they've been gone for eons.

27:38.323 --> 27:41.327
No, not gone.

27:41.535 --> 27:44.129
In hiding.

27:44.329 --> 27:45.797
How come I've never heard
of them?

27:45.998 --> 27:48.421
Because they don't exist
anymore.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.719
When I was a girl..

27:50.919 --> 27:54.014
My grandfather
was one of those..

27:54.214 --> 27:56.262
Monsters.

27:56.466 --> 27:59.185
They live to cause pain.

27:59.386 --> 28:02.981
My father ran away
for all of us.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.025
[intense music]

28:10.981 --> 28:12.733
Don't add up.

28:12.941 --> 28:14.739
Brujeria wielded a magic
the world hasn't seen

28:14.943 --> 28:16.820
since God turned on the lights.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.407
He struck them down. Not even
hell would give them asylum.

28:19.615 --> 28:21.162
- They were annihilated.
- You don't believe her?

28:21.366 --> 28:24.336
I can't believe them, I don't
have a spell to shut down

28:24.536 --> 28:26.789
the brujeria, Anne Marie.
Nobody does.

28:26.997 --> 28:28.874
- She's speaking gibberish.
- Then why are you scared?

28:29.082 --> 28:30.459
I'm not scared.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.510
If the Brujeria were back,
we'd know it, alright?

28:32.711 --> 28:34.554
It wouldn't be subtle,
there would be..

28:37.716 --> 28:39.138
Bugger me.

28:39.343 --> 28:40.936
What is it?

28:41.136 --> 28:43.730
The rising darkness, it's, uh..

28:43.931 --> 28:46.025
What I checked myself out
of the asylum to fight.

28:46.225 --> 28:49.354
'If... the brujeria are behind it..'

28:53.357 --> 28:55.030
(Anne Marie) 'I can see it now,
it's not that you don't care'

28:55.234 --> 28:57.578
it's that you can't care about
anybody and do what you do.

29:02.449 --> 29:05.123
I think I did come here to hide.

29:05.327 --> 29:07.546
And it doesn't work.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.373
Under this disguise,
I'm the same scared girl

29:09.581 --> 29:11.424
I was at Newcastle.

29:15.462 --> 29:17.180
Disguise.

29:17.381 --> 29:20.305
If Lamashtu wants a baby
with Hugo's blood..

29:20.509 --> 29:22.261
Then I say we give her one.

29:22.469 --> 29:23.721
[dramatic music]

29:25.264 --> 29:27.517
Once we fill the poultry
with Hugo's blood

29:27.724 --> 29:31.649
I'll use a glamour spell to
make it look like an infant.

29:31.853 --> 29:34.026
'We'll hand it off
to our evil lady friend'

29:34.231 --> 29:37.701
and she will kindly lead us
to her baby stash.

29:37.901 --> 29:39.403
If Lamashtu is working
for the brujeria

29:39.611 --> 29:40.863
you'd be walking
right onto their radar.

29:41.071 --> 29:43.540
Well, I didn't say
there weren't risks.

29:43.740 --> 29:45.413
How do you know
she won't attack you first?

29:45.617 --> 29:48.040
I'll present the baby
as a mother's offering.

29:48.245 --> 29:49.792
She'll have no reason
to hurt me.

29:49.997 --> 29:52.750
You tried to kill Lamashtu.
She won't come near you.

29:52.958 --> 29:54.380
No, that's a good point.

29:54.584 --> 29:57.258
[inhales]
I'll have to dress as a woman.

29:57.462 --> 29:59.590
Just need me a skirt and a wig.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.641
- Stop it.
- Stop what?

30:01.800 --> 30:04.144
This kind of pathetic ruse might
have worked with Gary Lester

30:04.344 --> 30:07.268
but I think I deserve
a little more respect.

30:07.472 --> 30:09.645
[chuckfing] I have no idea what
you're talking about, luv.

30:09.850 --> 30:11.227
You need me
to make this offering.

30:11.435 --> 30:12.857
You're counting on it.

30:13.061 --> 30:14.904
[music continues]

30:17.399 --> 30:19.777
Look, we had our shot
at life, Annie.

30:19.985 --> 30:22.659
We've made our mistakes,
but these, these are..

30:22.863 --> 30:25.457
They're babies.

30:25.657 --> 30:28.331
No price is too high
to save the innocent.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.665
Thank you for your honesty.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.507
I'll make the handoff.

30:37.711 --> 30:40.555
[music continues]

31:00.233 --> 31:02.361
[Qroans]

31:02.569 --> 31:04.412
You don't need to fight.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.832
Our father wants
what's best for you.

31:07.032 --> 31:10.377
(Zed) 'Oh, so he's your
father, too, now, is he?'

31:10.577 --> 31:12.295
Funny.

31:12.496 --> 31:14.965
I don't remember you
from my childhood.

31:15.165 --> 31:17.668
Maybe it's because
I spent most of it..

31:17.876 --> 31:18.968
In a locked room.

31:19.169 --> 31:20.341
That was for your protection.

31:20.545 --> 31:21.671
You know what you mean to us.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.257
You're our salvation.

31:23.465 --> 31:24.967
Eddie.

31:25.175 --> 31:26.518
Is that even your real name?

31:28.887 --> 31:30.514
How did you find me?

31:30.722 --> 31:32.019
We're the Crusade.

31:32.224 --> 31:34.226
Our believers are everywhere.

31:34.434 --> 31:35.811
We will always find you.

31:38.814 --> 31:40.532
Damn it, Eddie!

31:40.732 --> 31:42.450
You led them up here?

31:42.651 --> 31:43.823
You don't know what they are!

31:44.027 --> 31:45.779
[dramatic music]

31:50.909 --> 31:52.911
[breathing heavily]

31:53.120 --> 31:55.088
One more step..

31:55.247 --> 31:56.339
And I'll kill him.

31:56.540 --> 31:58.963
[gunshot]

31:59.167 --> 32:00.760
I'm so sorry.

32:00.961 --> 32:04.181
You should be. Could've made
this much easier on all of us.

32:04.381 --> 32:06.679
Awake or asleep?

32:06.883 --> 32:08.351
Your choice.

32:09.970 --> 32:11.563
May be a few minutes
before Lamashtu arrives

32:11.763 --> 32:14.858
but she'll sniff out the blood.

32:15.058 --> 32:17.060
Now, do you remember the words?

32:17.269 --> 32:18.612
Take this child
into your dark womb

32:18.812 --> 32:20.655
and give it eternal life.

32:23.984 --> 32:27.158
You know..

32:27.362 --> 32:30.582
You know you never had
anything to repent for..

32:30.782 --> 32:32.500
Newcastle.

32:32.701 --> 32:34.169
That was my failure.

32:35.871 --> 32:37.999
You don't owe nothing for that.

32:38.206 --> 32:39.503
You're wrong, John.

32:39.708 --> 32:44.384
I owe an anxious 15-year-old boy
with no self worth.

32:44.588 --> 32:48.434
Always hiding from your father
and aching for a mum.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.010
Should've shagged you then
but instead

32:50.218 --> 32:51.936
I introduced you to my world.

32:54.181 --> 32:56.525
It was a world of wonders.

32:56.725 --> 32:58.193
Which you followed into hell.

33:00.020 --> 33:01.897
You are my failure, John.

33:03.565 --> 33:05.408
It's a matter of perspective.

33:11.490 --> 33:14.619
- 'What is this?'
- The icon of Pazuzu.

33:14.826 --> 33:17.124
It's a bastardly demon.

33:17.329 --> 33:20.082
Used to be Lamashtu's soul mate.

33:20.290 --> 33:22.634
But now she hates his guts.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.461
I can relate.

you got to let us do what we do.

Look, I know
your heart's in the right place

35:37.260 --> 35:38.853
but you'll kill him.

35:39.054 --> 35:41.227
Okay, go. Go.
Go. Take-take this!

35:41.431 --> 35:43.729

that her baby
is really a bloody chicken.

36:47.831 --> 36:49.378
It's not a good idea
to split up.

We can't lose her now.

of your precious little cargo,

and then you'll have to explain
to them why you failed.

Now, why are you working
for the brujeria?

38:27.305 --> 38:29.854

- Not now.

will become one.'

from us.
