Have you ever heard of Christmas?

Well, it's a celebration we have
once a year on Earth,

01:16.916 --> 01:19.625
where everybody gets presents
for each other.

01:20.458 --> 01:23.666
So, me and Kraglin made this tree
and we got gifts for everyone.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.000
It was Pete's idea.

01:25.458 --> 01:26.875
Eh...

01:26.958 --> 01:31.333
-And this one here's for you.
-Don't come at me with no damn gifts.

What a Ravager gets, he works for.
We ain't about no damn handouts.

-It's more like a sign of appreciation.
-That sounds more like sentiment, boy.

That may be okay for you

01:44.125 --> 01:47.166

it's what'll get you killed.

be able to help us out

I learned from Rocket,

who learned from Kraglin,

04:22.583 --> 04:23.708

No.

05:18.666 --> 05:20.833
If you don't leave milk and cookies out

05:21.333 --> 05:24.458
He will put dung in your socks

05:24.541 --> 05:26.750
That is not part of the lore at all.

05:29.875 --> 05:32.583
And don't jump on your bed

and hurls them at your head

05:38.958 --> 05:41.625

05:41.708 --> 05:44.500

He might just roast your chestnuts

05:47.291 --> 05:52.041

-What?
-What did you do?

28:12.458 --> 28:16.791
-We got you Kevin Bacon as a present.
-You got me a human being as a present?

28:16.875 --> 28:18.958
What better gift for the guy
who has everything

28:19.041 --> 28:21.583
than an actual human living person?

28:21.666 --> 28:25.625
This isn't a Christmas gift!
This is human trafficking!

28:25.708 --> 28:28.333
-Yes!
-It was mostly Drax's idea.

28:28.541 --> 28:29.541
It was.

28:29.625 --> 28:31.208
Hey, Pete, I got to stick up
for these guys,

28:31.291 --> 28:33.166
because to tell you the truth,

28:33.250 --> 28:36.458
I am totally stoked
about the whole thing, man.

28:38.625 --> 28:42.291
-You used your powers on him, didn't you?
-Maybe. I can't remember.

28:42.375 --> 28:45.083
Get Kevin Bacon out of the trance now!

28:49.208 --> 28:50.833
Just be what you really are.

28:58.375 --> 28:59.833
-(SCREAMS)
-(GASPS)

29:01.250 --> 29:03.375
(SCREAMING)

29:03.500 --> 29:05.875
Dude, calm down. We're not gonna hurt you.

29:06.375 --> 29:09.791
-That's a talking raccoon.
-I'll kill you. Don't ever call me that!

29:09.875 --> 29:11.208
Whoa!

29:11.291 --> 29:13.125
Sir, sir, sir. Right here, right here.

29:13.583 --> 29:17.250
Kraglin, prepare The Bowie
for his transport back to Earth.

29:17.333 --> 29:19.208
-Aye, Captain.
-Mr. Bacon, I am so sorry.

29:19.375 --> 29:20.375
This is really embarrassing.

29:20.458 --> 29:23.083
I know you're worried sick
and your family is, too.

29:23.166 --> 29:24.958
We're gonna get you back home immediately.

29:25.041 --> 29:26.166
I am Groot.

29:26.250 --> 29:28.833
Oh. Suddenly you thought
it was a bad idea all along?

29:28.916 --> 29:29.916
I am Groot.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.500
Dude, I literally just saw you
wheel him out in front of everybody.

29:35.250 --> 29:38.333
I'm gonna let you go, Kevin Bacon.
Don't run.

29:38.958 --> 29:41.125
-You're not gonna run?
-No, no. No, no, no.

29:41.791 --> 29:43.041
(SHOUTS IN FEAR)

29:44.875 --> 29:47.458
-Go get Kevin Bacon.
-I've got it.

29:48.416 --> 29:51.500
-Don't kill him.
-NEBULA: You can't outrun me, Bacon!

30:03.041 --> 30:04.666
Hey, that man was a plant.

30:04.750 --> 30:08.625
Oh, Groot? He's just a kid.
Sorry about all this stuff.

30:09.166 --> 30:10.708
What's that on your head?

30:11.500 --> 30:14.958
That is a device for
controlling a flying arrow.

30:15.041 --> 30:17.333
But I ain't quite got the hang of it yet.

30:19.083 --> 30:20.708
I know this must all be a shock to you,

30:20.791 --> 30:25.083
but it's only 'cause you mean a great deal
to Pete that they've done it.

30:26.708 --> 30:28.291
Pete didn't have much to love growing up,

30:28.375 --> 30:32.041
but one thing he did love
was telling us all stories about you.

30:32.333 --> 30:36.000
-Me?
-You saved a town through dancing.

30:36.916 --> 30:41.708
And once, Pete saved the whole galaxy
with dancing. For real.

30:42.250 --> 30:43.958
You taught him how to be a hero,

30:44.958 --> 30:47.250
and now he might just be
the greatest hero alive.

30:52.250 --> 30:53.416
Mant and these dopes,

30:53.500 --> 30:58.625
they was just hoping you'd bring the joy
of Christmas back into his heart, is all.

31:05.250 --> 31:06.416
Whoa!

31:10.000 --> 31:12.583
How on earth do you get reception up here?

31:14.250 --> 31:15.791
Couple of good satellite dishes out front

31:15.875 --> 31:18.541
will get you anything within about
400 million light-years.

31:18.625 --> 31:19.625
Hi, honey.

31:19.708 --> 31:20.750
KYRA: Are you at the house?

31:20.833 --> 31:23.916
Yeah, no, (STAMMERS)
I'm just with some friends.

31:24.458 --> 31:26.958
Oh, okay. Well, what time
do you think you'll be home?

31:29.708 --> 31:33.708
Hey, would it be okay
if I'm just a little bit late?

31:35.125 --> 31:39.958
I got some friends here that
kind of need to learn about Christmas.

31:45.916 --> 31:47.291

We are swaddled and snuggled

31:59.708 --> 32:03.333
Whispered to, fussed over
Tickled and cuddled

32:03.500 --> 32:07.166
When we grow up things get muddled

32:07.333 --> 32:09.958
And here it is Christmastime

32:11.250 --> 32:15.666
Will you stop by
for a piece of delicious peach pie?

32:15.750 --> 32:18.666
While I tell you my yuletide wishes

32:18.875 --> 32:22.333
You can help me do the dishes

32:22.416 --> 32:25.291
'Cause here it is Christmastime

32:25.416 --> 32:27.458
And we all want someone

32:28.750 --> 32:31.250
Who will love us and hold us

32:32.958 --> 32:35.625
To curl up alongside

32:36.708 --> 32:39.375
When nights are the coldest

32:40.750 --> 32:43.041
And we all want someone

32:43.958 --> 32:46.625
Who will hug us and kiss us

32:49.625 --> 32:53.125
All I want is you for Christmas

32:55.166 --> 32:58.625
Let us examine the holiday spirit

32:58.750 --> 33:02.500
Let the small kids sing
so we can all hear it

33:02.583 --> 33:06.166
Light up a fire and pull the chair near it

33:06.291 --> 33:08.250
'Cause here it is Christmastime

33:08.375 --> 33:09.708
Bucky's arm?

We all want someone

33:12.208 --> 33:13.208
Merry Christmas.

33:13.291 --> 33:15.291

Wow. I guess all actors aren't
complete pieces of shit.

35:46.250 --> 35:50.791
I can't believe you guys did
all of that for me. I mean, why?

35:51.541 --> 35:52.541
Why what?

35:52.625 --> 35:56.000
Why would you go to the trouble of going
all the way to Earth

35:56.083 --> 35:59.208
to abduct Kevin Bacon?

36:01.125 --> 36:04.750
Kraglin told us the story
about how Yondu ruined Christmas.

That's Yondu.

37:08.125 --> 37:13.625
I guess I just wanted to do something
special for you, because, well...

37:17.416 --> 37:20.250
-What?
-Your father, Peter.

37:22.166 --> 37:26.166
-He might be...
-Ego? He might be what?
