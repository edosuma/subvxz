Melanie: Previously on
<i>Hot In Cleveland.</i>

00:03.670 --> 00:05.755
The mayor is dead

00:05.839 --> 00:08.758
in my bed!

00:08.842 --> 00:12.220
So we sneak the mayor's body
back to his mansion,

00:12.303 --> 00:14.180
put him back
in his own bed,

00:14.264 --> 00:16.933
and then everyone thinks
he died peacefully in his sleep.

00:17.016 --> 00:19.102
It really looks like
he died in his sleep,

00:19.185 --> 00:20.437
{\an3}and that's what
people will think.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.147
Yeah.

00:22.230 --> 00:23.940
Ashley: Ted, you're never
going to cheat on me again!

00:24.023 --> 00:26.151

00:28.027 --> 00:29.112
{\an1}Oh, God.

00:29.195 --> 00:30.780
She shot the mayor.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.408
Technically, I'm the mayor.

00:34.993 --> 00:37.746
Dead mayor.
People are gonna want answers.

00:37.829 --> 00:40.290
{\an1}Let's hope the acting mayor
can handle the pressure.

00:40.373 --> 00:41.666
Chief Barker.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.168
Your Honor.

00:43.251 --> 00:44.753
{\an3}We would have
been here sooner,

00:44.836 --> 00:46.588
{\an3}but it took us a while
to find the mayor's bedroom,

00:46.671 --> 00:48.089
{\an3}'cause, you know,
we've never actually

00:48.173 --> 00:49.257
been in the mayor's bedroom.

00:49.340 --> 00:52.260
So why would we?

00:52.343 --> 00:54.053
Okay, let me fill you in.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.639
{\an3}The mayor died
of natural causes.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.933
But evidence indicates
that the body was moved.

00:59.017 --> 01:02.270
Well, it happens.

01:02.353 --> 01:05.857
Not really.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.984
{\an3}And even more strange,
the mayor was untouched,

01:08.067 --> 01:09.360
{\an3}but there are
three bullet holes

01:09.444 --> 01:10.987
{\an3}fired into
the pillow next to him.

01:11.070 --> 01:12.489
Which is probably
a way bigger crime

01:12.572 --> 01:13.740
than moving a body,
which is something

01:13.823 --> 01:15.325
{\an3}that could happen
almost by accident,

01:15.408 --> 01:17.619
{\an3}so I'd concentrate
on those bullet holes.

01:17.702 --> 01:19.662
{\an3}We're concentrating
on all of it.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.581
{\an3}Well, the mayor would like
outside investigators.

01:21.664 --> 01:23.500
She feels we should handle
this discreetly,

01:23.583 --> 01:25.335
so as not to cause
a major scandal.

01:25.418 --> 01:26.836
And we already have
some people in mind.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.507
{\an3}They are thorough and smart
and very discreet.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.008
These guys sound good.

01:32.091 --> 01:33.843
They're damn good.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.512
[camera shutter snapping]

01:35.595 --> 01:37.847
{\an1}The client is
Elka Ostrovsky.

01:37.931 --> 01:42.185
{\an3}Yesterday Mayor Deacon
died in Elka's bed.

01:42.268 --> 01:45.063
With a smile
on his face.

01:45.146 --> 01:47.690
Just saying.

01:47.774 --> 01:50.527
The body was moved back
to the mayor's residence

01:50.610 --> 01:52.695
{\an1}with the help
of Melanie Moretti.

01:52.779 --> 01:56.491
No, no, no,
you can't use that picture!

01:56.574 --> 01:59.661
It's a publicity still from
your radio show, it's fine.

01:59.744 --> 02:02.163
It is not fine.
Everyone else looks cool.

02:02.247 --> 02:06.042
And I look like they shrunk me
and gave me a 30-year-old phone.

02:06.125 --> 02:08.044
Forget the photo,
Melanie.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.380
We have a scandal here
that Elka can't be tied to.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.215
This is a serious matter.

02:12.298 --> 02:14.008
And speaking of serious,

02:14.092 --> 02:16.886
last night Joy Scroggs
and Bob Moore

02:16.970 --> 02:20.849
seriously professed
their love for one another.

02:20.932 --> 02:22.767
Oh, Bob.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.103
We were called in
on this case right away

02:25.186 --> 02:27.188
{\an1}and haven't had time
for our first kiss yet.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.274
{\an1}We were waiting
for the perfect moment.

02:29.357 --> 02:30.441
Well, that is just
so sweet.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.068
First kisses
are so important.

02:32.151 --> 02:33.736
{\an1}Oh, they set the tone
for the entire relationship.

02:33.820 --> 02:34.904
[all talking at once]

02:34.988 --> 02:39.576
Hey, hey, hey!

02:39.659 --> 02:42.829
My next kiss could be
with a prison guard.

02:44.497 --> 02:47.167
{\an3}In exchange
for cigarettes.

02:50.336 --> 02:53.298
{\an3}As hot as that sounds,
Elka is right.

02:53.381 --> 02:55.884
And there's one other player we
have to deal with in this saga.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.760
Meet Dane Stevens.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.429
{\an3}He's a reporter that's been
nosing around the mayor's place,

02:59.512 --> 03:01.097
asking a lot of questions.

03:01.180 --> 03:03.766
{\an3}Now one of you is gonna have
to use your feminine wiles

03:03.850 --> 03:07.854
to get him off the scent.

03:07.937 --> 03:09.981
Joy, really?

03:10.064 --> 03:11.441
I'll do it.

03:11.524 --> 03:12.901
{\an1}I'll call him
and set up a meeting.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.152
{\an3}Well, it makes sense
that you'd call.

03:14.235 --> 03:17.113
{\an3}You're the one
with the big phone.

03:17.196 --> 03:18.448
All right, now,
there's something else

03:18.531 --> 03:20.617
that needs our
immediate attention.

03:20.700 --> 03:24.871
This glamorous, Oscar-winning
woman is in trouble.

03:24.954 --> 03:28.333
Now HBO wants to test
my show today in Cleveland.

03:28.416 --> 03:29.751
And if it doesn't test well,

03:29.834 --> 03:31.920
then they may decide
not to air it.

03:32.003 --> 03:34.005
And if I weren't
so concerned about Elka,

03:34.088 --> 03:36.132
{\an1}I'd be down there right now
trying to sway the vote.

03:36.215 --> 03:38.968
But I'm needed here to--

03:39.052 --> 03:41.429
What am I doing?

03:41.512 --> 03:44.098
Nothing.

03:44.182 --> 03:46.142
Bless you, Elka.

03:46.225 --> 03:48.770
Okay, here's the plan.

03:48.853 --> 03:50.438
Bob and I
will break into the morgue

03:50.521 --> 03:52.774
{\an1}and clean any evidence
off the mayor.

03:52.857 --> 03:55.652
I'm assuming there's some
of your DNA on his body?

03:55.735 --> 03:57.612
And glitter.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.366
{\an1}Which leaves us
with one loose end.

04:01.449 --> 04:03.493
Who shot the mayor's pillow?

04:03.576 --> 04:04.786
We've done a little digging,

04:04.869 --> 04:06.287
and we now know
that in addition to Elka,

04:06.371 --> 04:08.206
the mayor was sleeping
with two other women.

04:08.289 --> 04:11.000
This is Miss Shonda,

04:11.084 --> 04:15.129
an astrologist the mayor
was consulting.

04:15.213 --> 04:16.589
We don't know
who this is,

04:16.673 --> 04:18.382
but we have this surveillance
photo of her

04:18.466 --> 04:20.843
leaving the mayor's house
at an earlier date.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.012
{\an3}We need to find out
which of these mistresses

04:23.096 --> 04:24.806
is the shooter

04:24.889 --> 04:26.975
{\an3}and if she knows
anything about Elka.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.476
{\an1}You know,
as a private detective

04:28.559 --> 04:30.186
{\an1}I'm trained to look
for patterns in behavior,

04:30.269 --> 04:32.021
but I'm baffled.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.690
{\an1}If he was sleeping
with her,

04:33.773 --> 04:36.484
{\an1}why would he wanna
sleep with...

04:41.781 --> 04:44.367
{\an1}her?

04:44.450 --> 04:47.203
You, I totally get.

04:47.286 --> 04:49.872
{\an3}Okay, so we all know
our assignments.

Yes, I'll call
the hot journalist.

04:50.873 --> 04:52.709
{\an3}We'll take care
of the mayor's body.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.043
I'll deal
with the mistresses.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.546
And I'll call
the hot journalist.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.047

Anyway, all the other teams
did well.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.993
Bob and I cleaned up
the mayor's body,

09:37.076 --> 09:40.204
and Elka eliminated
the astrologist as a suspect.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.665
{\an1}Yes, and since
the astrologist wasn't there,

09:42.748 --> 09:44.375
{\an1}we know that this is
the woman who fired the shots.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.794
We need to find her.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.004
Ashley: And another thing,

09:48.087 --> 09:49.505
the premise is totally
unbelievable.

09:49.588 --> 09:51.632
{\an3}Ugh, she's been going on
like this for an hour.

09:51.716 --> 09:54.051
{\an3}Can't we get her
thrown out?

09:54.135 --> 09:57.513
{\an1}Sorry, that's the way
these things go sometimes.

09:57.596 --> 09:58.931
One bad apple
can kill a show.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.980
{\an1}Murderer.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.695
[camera shutter clicking]

10:12.778 --> 10:14.947
Okay, we found out
the shooter's name.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.699
It's Ashley Dreyer.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.159
We traced her cell.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.202
{\an1}She's currently
at 42 Park Drive.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.746
Somebody's gotta
go talk to her.

10:21.829 --> 10:22.747
{\an3}I'll do it.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.206
We'll be two model types

10:24.290 --> 10:27.918
talking about
the man we shared.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.503
I wanna come too.

10:29.587 --> 10:30.755
If I can my Fitbit
up to 20,000 steps,

10:30.838 --> 10:33.382
I get an extra glass
of wine.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.260
Oh, no, my Fitbit,
it's gone!

10:36.344 --> 10:38.554
What if I lost it
at the mayor's house?

10:38.637 --> 10:40.097
Well, that's okay.
You were there this morning.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.265
Say you lost it then.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.558
No, no, no,
I got the fancy one

10:42.641 --> 10:43.559
that tracks
every place you've been

10:43.642 --> 10:44.769
and when you've been there.

10:44.852 --> 10:46.228
It'll show that
I was there last night.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.730
Which will implicate you
in a crime.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.565
Or worse!

10:49.649 --> 10:52.068
I haven't gotten credit
for any of my steps all day!

10:54.653 --> 10:56.447
{\an3}All right, everyone,
let's take lunch.

10:56.530 --> 10:59.909
We'll watch another episode
in an hour.

11:03.662 --> 11:05.289
Victoria Chase?

11:05.373 --> 11:08.125
{\an3}Oh, don't you
"Victoria Chase" me.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.543
I know what you did.

11:09.627 --> 11:10.878
You're a murderer.

11:10.961 --> 11:12.254
{\an1}How do you know
about that?

11:12.338 --> 11:13.297
{\an3}I watched you
through the window.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.216
{\an3}I saw every shot
you took.

11:15.299 --> 11:17.802
{\an1}Oh, my gosh, I only did it
because I was jealous.

11:17.885 --> 11:19.887
Well, I get that.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.430
But I'll make you a deal.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.100
{\an3}You convince people to give
my show a good review,

11:24.183 --> 11:26.936
{\an3}and I'll forget
that I ever saw anything.

11:27.019 --> 11:27.978
{\an1}That's it?

11:28.062 --> 11:30.481
{\an3}Hmm.

11:30.564 --> 11:31.607
What are you doing here?

11:31.690 --> 11:33.401
{\an3}Well, what are you
doing here?

11:33.484 --> 11:35.820
I'm here to see her.

11:35.903 --> 11:37.446
I know what you did.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.616
Does everybody
know what I did?

11:40.699 --> 11:43.411
{\an1}She's the other mistress.
She shot the mayor.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.037
{\an3}What?

11:45.121 --> 11:46.622
What were you talking about?

11:46.705 --> 11:49.083
{\an3}That.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.752
I can't lie anymore.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.129
Not about the murder.

11:53.212 --> 11:56.298
Not about Victoria's show
being good.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.509
{\an3}I'm just gonna go
to the police and confess.

11:58.592 --> 12:00.136
Just take it easy.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.763
{\an1}Now, there's no need
to get the police involved.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.349
{\an1}The truth is
you didn't kill the mayor.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.976
Elka gave him
a heart attack.

12:07.059 --> 12:09.103
In bed.

12:09.186 --> 12:12.982
He died doing someone
he loved.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.984
So it's agreed,

12:15.067 --> 12:16.652
{\an3}we won't tell the police
that you were the shooter,

12:16.735 --> 12:18.362
and you will keep
your mouth closed

12:18.446 --> 12:19.822
{\an3}about Elka and
the mayor's relationship.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.157
{\an3}Done.

12:21.240 --> 12:25.327
{\an3}Oh, you two with
the same man.

12:25.411 --> 12:29.331
And yet my show
is unbelievable.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.294
{\an3}Oh, my God.

12:33.377 --> 12:35.379
What?
Did you find my Fitbit?

12:35.463 --> 12:39.842
I just looked at Joy, and
I can't believe I'm with her.

12:39.925 --> 12:42.470
So no,
you did not find it.

12:42.553 --> 12:45.514
Oh, Bob,
I'm so lucky.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.016
Let's have that first kiss.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.058
{\an3}Not now.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.852
{\an1}Why?

12:49.935 --> 12:51.479
{\an3}Well, we both want
our first kiss to be perfect,

12:51.562 --> 12:54.690
{\an3}and right now I--
I feel fat.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.317
{\an3}I ate a donut.
I wasn't even hungry.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.445
{\an3}I--I hate myself.
I'm hideous.

13:01.238 --> 13:03.866
{\an1}You're beating yourself up
over one donut.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.868
{\an3}Did I leave out
the word "dozen"?

13:07.745 --> 13:09.330
Hello, Melanie.

13:09.413 --> 13:10.831
{\an3}Dane, how did you
get in here?

13:10.915 --> 13:13.375
{\an3}This is a sealed crime scene.
No press allowed.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.377
{\an1}I know, but the policewoman
at the door

13:15.461 --> 13:18.547
{\an1}patted me down a few times
and let me right in.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.090
What are you doing here?

13:20.174 --> 13:22.676
{\an3}Well, um,
I'm here to, um,

13:22.760 --> 13:25.429
{\an3}prepare the room
for the next acting mayor,

13:25.513 --> 13:28.098
{\an3}and these are
the decorators.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.726
Yes, I'm a decorator,

13:30.809 --> 13:33.938
you handsome guy, you.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.773
{\an3}You're gay?

13:35.856 --> 13:37.733
I thought I just heard you
talking about kissing her.

13:37.816 --> 13:39.235
Well, I'm straight for joy.

13:39.318 --> 13:42.363
I'm just gay for design.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.368
We became a couple
last night,

13:47.451 --> 13:49.370
but we haven't had
our first kiss yet.

13:49.453 --> 13:50.788
{\an3}You don't plan
your first kiss.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.831
You take it.

14:01.465 --> 14:04.885
{\an3}That is how
you kiss a woman.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.762
{\an1}Yes.

14:06.845 --> 14:09.265
Yes, it is.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.308
Well, I was hoping that
there was a story here,

14:11.392 --> 14:15.396
but if there was I guess
you guys would have found it.

14:15.479 --> 14:16.939
{\an3}If my writing career
were a sentence,

14:17.022 --> 14:22.778
{\an3}this would be that dot thing
at the end of it.

14:22.861 --> 14:25.406
Dane, I'm sure you're
a terrific journalist.

14:25.489 --> 14:27.241
Just find something
that interests you

14:27.324 --> 14:28.951
and then write about that.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.286
Thanks, Melanie.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.912
{\an3}It means a lot
that you believe in me.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.623
Yes, well, that was
a really great kiss.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.084
{\an3}It was,
wasn't it?

14:37.167 --> 14:39.587
Hey, what is this?

14:39.670 --> 14:41.797
{\an1}Well, looks like
somebody's Fitbit.

14:41.880 --> 14:43.299
That's mine!
My Fitbit.

14:43.382 --> 14:48.345
{\an3}I dropped it when I was
legitimately here.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.889
{\an1}Wait.
Legitimately here?

14:52.683 --> 14:56.020
{\an1}Why is everything you say
so darn cute?

14:58.647 --> 15:00.983
[camera shutter clicking]

15:01.066 --> 15:02.651
{\an3}Well, we've cleaned
the body of Elka's DNA,

15:02.735 --> 15:04.320
silenced the witnesses,

15:04.403 --> 15:06.780
and there's no incriminating
evidence at the crime scene.

15:06.864 --> 15:09.158
The fixers have fixed it.

15:09.241 --> 15:10.993
- Yes.
- Thank goodness.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.329
One might say that now
is the perfect moment

15:13.412 --> 15:14.663
for a kiss.

15:14.747 --> 15:15.623
One might.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.003
Hold on!

15:21.086 --> 15:23.464
I know that you were having
an affair with the mayor

15:23.547 --> 15:25.841
and that you two
moved the body.

15:25.924 --> 15:27.926
Oh, come on!

15:32.222 --> 15:34.183
[camera shutter clicking]

15:34.266 --> 15:36.018
The mayor died
of natural causes.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.520
You said you weren't
chasing this story anymore.

15:38.604 --> 15:39.980
I wasn't.

15:40.064 --> 15:42.191
But Melanie gave me
some good advice.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.360
She told me to find something
I'm interested in.

15:44.443 --> 15:48.030
And unfortunately,
I'm interested in her.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.032
Really?

15:50.115 --> 15:52.951
He said "unfortunately,"
Melanie.

15:54.953 --> 15:56.872
I found out you recently
filed a complaint

15:56.955 --> 15:58.540
with the police
against your neighbor's kid

15:58.624 --> 15:59.917
and his camera drone.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.418
I looked at his pictures,

16:01.502 --> 16:04.046
and while most of them
were of Melanie naked...

16:04.129 --> 16:06.048
Oh, my God.

16:06.131 --> 16:09.051
And?

16:09.134 --> 16:11.095
You have a gorgeous body.

16:11.178 --> 16:13.722
{\an3}Agreed.

16:13.806 --> 16:14.848
{\an1}Bob!

16:14.932 --> 16:16.892
{\an3}If you like curves.
Blegh, no!

16:16.975 --> 16:21.480
{\an3}Straight up and down for me,
thank you.

16:21.563 --> 16:24.233
But there was a shot of the
mayor going into Elka's house.

16:24.316 --> 16:27.111
{\an3}So?
We were seeing each other.

16:27.194 --> 16:28.529
And there was another shot
of you and Melanie

16:28.612 --> 16:30.239
dragging a rolled-up rug

16:30.322 --> 16:32.408
with the mayor's foot
sticking out of one end.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.660
Would you believe foreplay?

16:36.870 --> 16:40.874
{\an3}What are you planning on doing
with this information?

16:40.958 --> 16:43.168
{\an1}Well, if I cared about the law,
I'd call the police.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.421
{\an1}If I cared about my job,
I'd write the story.

16:45.504 --> 16:48.757
{\an1}But right now,
I only care about you.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.051
{\an3}Oh, Dane.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.470
{\an3}Well, if Dane could find
these photos,

16:53.554 --> 16:55.639
{\an3}sooner or later the police
are gonna find them too.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.266
We need a plan.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.809
Bob's right.

16:58.892 --> 17:01.854
There's only
one thing to do.

17:01.937 --> 17:04.606
And that's the whole story.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.608
{\an1}So the body-dragging,
the shooting,

17:06.692 --> 17:08.694
{\an1}the cover-up,
that was all you?

17:08.777 --> 17:10.612
No one else here
was involved?

17:10.695 --> 17:12.698
No one else here
is smart enough.

17:16.367 --> 17:19.954
I believe that.

17:20.038 --> 17:21.623
{\an1}But you realize I'm going
to have to arrest you

17:21.707 --> 17:23.500
and take you downtown.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.127
Oh, my God!

17:25.210 --> 17:28.338
My HBO show is gonna air.

17:28.422 --> 17:31.133
I'm sorry
for this interruption,

17:31.216 --> 17:34.303
but, you know,
during this terrible tragedy

17:34.386 --> 17:38.140
isn't it nice that we can
all have some good news?

17:38.223 --> 17:40.267
Are you ready to go,
Your Honor?

17:40.350 --> 17:41.602
I'm ready.

17:41.685 --> 17:43.312
Bob, what can we do?

17:43.395 --> 17:44.980
{\an1}Well, on <i> Scandal</i>
Olivia Pope

17:45.063 --> 17:46.648
{\an1}would always make a speech
and save the day.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.442
That's so implausible.

17:48.525 --> 17:51.779
Yeah, but it just might work.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.781
Elka's ready, Chief,
but are you ready?

17:53.864 --> 17:55.991
{\an1}Are you ready to give up
the sun?

17:56.074 --> 17:58.243
{\an3}Yes, you could throw
this woman in jail

17:58.327 --> 17:59.828
for a victimless crime.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.330
But the second you book her,

18:01.413 --> 18:02.998
{\an3}this crime does have
a victim:

18:03.081 --> 18:04.541
the city of Cleveland.

18:04.625 --> 18:08.045
{\an1}Let me paint a picture
of the dark days that lay ahead.

18:08.128 --> 18:10.672
{\an1}You arrest her,
and the seamy details

18:10.756 --> 18:13.133
{\an1}become national news
and Cleveland becomes a joke.

18:13.217 --> 18:16.386
{\an1}Again.

18:16.470 --> 18:17.471
{\an1}Remember what they
used to call us,

18:17.554 --> 18:18.847
"The Mistake by the Lake"?

18:18.931 --> 18:20.015
"Burnt River City"?

18:20.098 --> 18:23.143
"Crap Town."

18:23.227 --> 18:25.521
{\an1}But Cleveland can't survive
a scandal like this.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.856
{\an1}One mayor dies
in a secret love nest,

18:27.940 --> 18:29.983
{\an1}the next mayor
tries to cover it up.

18:30.067 --> 18:33.403
{\an1}Before you know it,
we're Cincinnati.

18:36.115 --> 18:40.619
{\an1}And Cleveland's time
in the sun, well, it's over.

18:42.412 --> 18:43.872
I love this town.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.877
The official word
will be that Ted Deacon

18:48.961 --> 18:50.546
died alone in his bed,
in his home,

18:50.629 --> 18:52.214
of natural causes,

18:52.297 --> 18:54.424
as the proud mayor
of this great city.

18:54.508 --> 18:56.927
- Oh, thank you, Chief.
- Oh, that's fantastic.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.720
I could write that story.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.722
And I could kiss this man.

19:04.935 --> 19:06.937
Hey, who's that girl
in the red sweater?

19:18.657 --> 19:20.617
So where do we go from here?

19:20.701 --> 19:22.744
Well, I did propose to you.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.746
You could accept this time.

19:24.830 --> 19:25.998
{\an1}Not yet.

19:26.081 --> 19:27.416
If this is the real thing,

19:27.499 --> 19:29.918
I want ours to be
a real courtship.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.461
{\an3}All right.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.255
Let's talk about
our first date.

19:33.338 --> 19:34.423
Hmm, it should be romantic.

19:34.506 --> 19:35.591
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.384
But not sex that night.

19:37.467 --> 19:41.513
{\an1}Maybe no sex
for lots of nights.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.807
{\an1}Because I've slept with
so many men on the first date

19:43.891 --> 19:47.311
{\an1}just for the physical
gratification.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.938
{\an3}Uh-huh.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.733
I mean, I'd hop into
the sack instantly,

19:52.816 --> 19:54.902
do anyone and anything

19:54.985 --> 19:57.446
just because it felt great.

19:57.529 --> 20:00.282
{\an1}And then wake up feeling
horrible the next day.

20:00.365 --> 20:03.994
{\an1}But with you,
I don't want that.

20:04.077 --> 20:07.289
Do not want that.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.291
{\an1}And sure,

20:09.374 --> 20:11.793
{\an1}the thrill of discovering
a new lover's body,

20:11.877 --> 20:14.671
{\an1}of finding new ways
to pleasure a man

20:14.755 --> 20:16.590
was always exciting.

20:16.673 --> 20:18.175
But was anybody happy?

20:22.429 --> 20:24.848
{\an1}I want things
to be perfect with you,

20:24.932 --> 20:27.142
no matter how long it takes.

20:27.225 --> 20:28.977
I want it to be special.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.520
{\an3}Yes.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.439
{\an3}Special.
