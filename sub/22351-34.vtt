00:02.000 --> 00:03.989
Previously on "Big Brother":

00:03.990 --> 00:05.539
With only six people left, it

00:05.540 --> 00:07.989
was time to draw a line in the

00:07.990 --> 00:08.990
sand.

00:08.990 --> 00:09.990
It's time for a bloodbath

00:09.991 --> 00:11.699
right now!

00:11.700 --> 00:12.989
And it seemed Vanessa was

00:12.990 --> 00:13.990
ready to choose a side.

00:13.990 --> 00:14.990
Now is the time to make this

00:14.991 --> 00:16.989
decision and take a shot at

00:16.990 --> 00:18.989
Austin and the twins.

00:18.990 --> 00:20.829
At the h.O.H. Competition,

00:20.830 --> 00:21.989
Steve knocked it out of the

00:21.990 --> 00:22.990
park.

00:22.990 --> 00:23.990
Steve, you are the new head

00:23.990 --> 00:24.990
of household!

00:24.990 --> 00:25.990
( Applause )

00:25.991 --> 00:28.829
And he set hissitis on a pair

00:28.830 --> 00:32.409
of targets.

00:32.410 --> 00:33.989
After learning Steve would no

00:33.990 --> 00:36.989
longer honor their five-person

00:36.990 --> 00:36.991
alliance...

00:36.991 --> 00:38.989
the thing is I'm on the

00:38.990 --> 00:41.989
bottom at the totem pole in the

00:41.990 --> 00:42.990
scamper squad.

00:42.990 --> 00:43.990
Not with me.

00:43.990 --> 00:44.990
We're at the point of the game

00:44.991 --> 00:46.989
where I to remember we're an

00:46.990 --> 00:47.990
individual first.

00:47.991 --> 00:49.989
I came in this house alone.

00:49.990 --> 00:51.989
And he warn Liz she could be

00:51.990 --> 00:52.990
in jeopardy.

00:52.990 --> 00:53.990
But Vanessa explained to Steve

00:53.991 --> 00:54.999
that putting the twins up may

00:55.000 --> 00:58.409
not be the best move.

00:58.410 --> 00:58.990
Julia?

00:58.990 --> 00:59.990
You have to.

00:59.991 --> 01:01.699
You have to rethink this.

01:01.700 --> 01:03.989
She is the least likely to win

01:03.990 --> 01:03.991
veto.

01:03.991 --> 01:05.989
And Johnny Mac told Steve

01:05.990 --> 01:07.989
Austin should be the true

01:07.990 --> 01:08.990
target.

01:08.990 --> 01:09.990
I think it's better for you,

01:09.991 --> 01:11.989
you and me personally.

01:11.990 --> 01:12.990
At the nomination ceremony...

01:12.991 --> 01:14.989
I have nominated you, Austin,

01:14.990 --> 01:18.989
and you, Liz, for eviction.

01:18.990 --> 01:19.990
Being on the block with her

01:19.991 --> 01:21.989
bay was too much for Liz to

01:21.990 --> 01:22.540
handle.

01:22.541 --> 01:23.989
Tonight, will the showmance be

01:23.990 --> 01:26.989
torn apart or can the power of

01:26.990 --> 01:28.989
veto save Liz-tin.

01:28.990 --> 01:31.119
Plus the entire house is thrown

01:31.120 --> 01:38.989
into emotional chaos.

01:38.990 --> 01:40.989
All this right now on "big

01:40.990 --> 01:42.989
brother."

01:42.990 --> 01:47.539
It's a show in Las Vegas,

01:47.540 --> 01:47.990
Sigmund... no.

01:47.991 --> 01:55.991
Sigmund and Freud.

01:56.540 --> 02:04.540
Captioning funded by CBS

02:24.700 --> 02:26.989
this nomination ceremony is

02:26.990 --> 02:31.989
adjourned.

02:31.990 --> 02:38.119
I feel sad because I... I'm

02:38.120 --> 02:39.989
just, like, disappointed that I

02:39.990 --> 02:40.990
have to be this this position,

02:40.991 --> 02:44.989
especially with my boyfriend.

02:44.990 --> 02:47.989
It's just tearing me apart.

02:47.990 --> 02:50.989
Steve has assured my safety.

02:50.990 --> 02:52.699
However, I'm on the block with

02:52.700 --> 02:53.410
my girlfriend.

02:53.411 --> 02:55.989
This is the conflict that faces

02:55.990 --> 02:57.989
everybody in a heroic quest.

02:57.990 --> 03:00.949
I have to choose between the

03:00.950 --> 03:02.699
girl and the glory.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.989
And I don't know what to do.

03:04.990 --> 03:06.989
My number one goal is to

03:06.990 --> 03:08.989
split us also-twins.

03:08.990 --> 03:10.989
I played a very passive and

03:10.990 --> 03:12.989
defensive game up to this point.

03:12.990 --> 03:14.989
Now that we're at end game

03:14.990 --> 03:16.989
you're going to see my turn into

03:16.990 --> 03:17.990
an aggressive player.

03:17.991 --> 03:20.989
People have been avoiding now

03:20.990 --> 03:27.989
for weeks.

03:27.990 --> 03:35.990
Crying )

03:36.990 --> 03:38.949
Don't cry, Liz, don't cry.

03:38.950 --> 03:39.989
It's not over yet.

03:39.990 --> 03:42.989
I know.

03:42.990 --> 03:43.990
There's veto tomorrow.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.409
It's our chance to try to get

03:45.410 --> 03:47.989
the veto, see if we can change

03:47.990 --> 03:50.989
his mind.

03:50.990 --> 03:53.989
I won't sleep all week.

03:53.990 --> 03:55.989
I didn't think he was going to

03:55.990 --> 03:59.289
be the one to betray us.

03:59.290 --> 04:00.989
This game eat at your mind.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.989
If Julia wins the veto,

04:02.990 --> 04:04.989
everything changes.

04:04.990 --> 04:06.539
It's really hard to ( Bleep )

04:06.540 --> 04:08.289
Depend on her, though.

04:08.290 --> 04:09.989
This is one time you're going

04:09.990 --> 04:10.410
to have to.

04:10.411 --> 04:12.989
Don't leave me alone, alone

04:12.990 --> 04:18.989
in this house, please.

04:18.990 --> 04:19.999
I will ( Bleep ) Fight for my

04:20.000 --> 04:20.990
life tomorrow.

04:20.991 --> 04:23.539
I would never do that to him.

04:23.540 --> 04:26.989
Ever.

04:26.990 --> 04:28.989
This means war.

04:28.990 --> 04:30.989
I'm going to put on a pretty

04:30.990 --> 04:33.989
fies and not cry and smile and

04:33.990 --> 04:36.989
pretend everything is peachy

04:36.990 --> 04:37.990
keen.

04:37.991 --> 04:39.989
Let's go eat our salad.

04:39.990 --> 04:44.999
I'm done.

04:45.000 --> 04:45.990
That was tough.

04:45.991 --> 04:47.699
That was tougher than I thought

04:47.700 --> 04:48.989
it would be for them.

04:48.990 --> 04:49.990
I know.

04:49.991 --> 04:51.989
I think it was tough for

04:51.990 --> 04:51.991
everyone.

04:51.991 --> 04:53.989
I haven't seen her cry like

04:53.990 --> 04:54.410
that.

04:54.411 --> 04:55.989
It get me a little emotional,

04:55.990 --> 04:56.830
you know.

04:56.831 --> 04:57.999
I hate hurting people.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.989
As you know, I'm someone who

05:00.990 --> 05:00.991
avoids confrontation.

05:00.991 --> 05:02.989
I just want to know if you

05:02.990 --> 05:03.990
need anything from me the rest

05:03.991 --> 05:05.989
of the week going forward

05:05.990 --> 05:07.989
because, again, my life is

05:07.990 --> 05:09.119
pretty much in your hand right

05:09.120 --> 05:09.990
now, too, so.

05:09.990 --> 05:10.990
I mean, veto.

05:10.991 --> 05:13.989
Yeah.

05:13.990 --> 05:14.990
Yeah, it's my time to sweat it

05:14.991 --> 05:16.989
out a little bit.

05:16.990 --> 05:18.409
79 days not being put on the

05:18.410 --> 05:19.989
block when I was a huge target

05:19.990 --> 05:22.989
week one, I think that's a big

05:22.989 --> 05:24.119
I'm just tailing Austin what

05:24.120 --> 05:25.989
he wants to hear right now, but

05:25.990 --> 05:27.989
in reality him and Liz are my

05:27.990 --> 05:28.990
two big targets this week.

05:28.991 --> 05:29.999
This is just one of those

05:30.000 --> 05:31.989
conversations you gotta have,

05:31.990 --> 05:33.989
got to make him feel nice and

05:33.990 --> 05:34.990
safe and comfortable and I'm

05:34.991 --> 05:36.699
very much looking forward to

05:36.700 --> 05:37.989
chopping his head off at the end

05:37.990 --> 05:39.119
of the week.

05:39.120 --> 05:40.989
I'm very sneaky.

05:40.990 --> 05:41.990
Good luck tomorrow.

05:41.991 --> 05:47.989
Thank you.

05:47.990 --> 05:48.990
Stop.

05:48.991 --> 05:50.989
I literally feel like I'm on my

05:50.990 --> 05:51.990
death bed.

05:51.991 --> 05:54.989
( Laughs )

05:54.990 --> 05:55.950
Stop!

05:55.951 --> 05:57.989
What, I wanna get cozy, that's

05:57.990 --> 05:58.990
all.

05:58.991 --> 06:00.989
You don't feel any animosity

06:00.990 --> 06:06.989
towards Steve?

06:06.990 --> 06:07.990
Okay.

06:07.991 --> 06:09.989
Oh, my God, if I win that

06:09.990 --> 06:11.989
vete oh, dude, he would probably

06:11.990 --> 06:12.990
put up Vanessa.

06:12.990 --> 06:13.990
Well, he'd have to.

06:13.991 --> 06:15.989
And then we could vote out

06:15.990 --> 06:15.991
Vanessa.

06:15.991 --> 06:16.990
We have the vote.

06:16.990 --> 06:17.990
Oh, my God.

06:17.991 --> 06:20.949
I'm gog, like, pray, like, every

06:20.950 --> 06:23.989
30 minutes.

06:23.990 --> 06:24.999
I need to win so I can save

06:25.000 --> 06:26.829
you and I can't dp up.

06:26.830 --> 06:31.989
Exactly.

06:31.990 --> 06:34.989
I know.

06:34.990 --> 06:36.119
The girls and I are on the

06:36.120 --> 06:37.989
same page that we could

06:37.990 --> 06:38.999
potentially throw this veto to

06:39.000 --> 06:40.989
Julia, because if Julia wins,

06:40.990 --> 06:42.949
she could pull Liz down, and

06:42.950 --> 06:43.989
those two vote can save me.

06:43.990 --> 06:45.989
If I go, you guys better take

06:45.990 --> 06:45.991
out Steve.

06:45.991 --> 06:47.989
That's all I have to say.

06:47.990 --> 06:51.989
If you go, I am a lion going

06:51.990 --> 06:53.989
after a gazelle, and I'm going

06:53.990 --> 06:55.989
to eat it for breakfast, lunch,

06:55.990 --> 07:02.989
and dinner.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.119
Hey, everyone, it's time for

07:05.120 --> 07:06.539
the veto competition.

07:06.540 --> 07:08.989
Get your gear on and meet me in

07:08.990 --> 07:09.990
the backyard.

07:09.990 --> 07:10.000
Veto!

07:10.001 --> 07:18.001
Oh, my God!

07:20.830 --> 07:22.539
So I walk into the backyard.

07:22.540 --> 07:24.699
I see he's hands rails that are

07:24.700 --> 07:26.949
going to go above my head.

07:26.950 --> 07:30.989
I see these long bowling Lane,

07:30.990 --> 07:33.989
this is bowl-a-rina.

07:33.990 --> 07:41.990
This is epic.

07:47.990 --> 07:49.539
Hey, how you doing?

07:49.540 --> 07:49.990
I'm Jessie.

07:49.991 --> 07:51.539
Hi, there.

07:51.540 --> 07:53.989
Oooh!

07:53.990 --> 07:57.989
Man, look at those pecs.

07:57.990 --> 07:59.989
I can't breathe.

07:59.990 --> 08:01.949
Mr. pecked tacular is cuter in

08:01.950 --> 08:02.999
person than he is on TV.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.949
You can see every inch of those

08:06.950 --> 08:09.829
pecs in those tight spandex.

08:09.830 --> 08:12.989
What's up, houseguests,

08:12.990 --> 08:13.990
Mr. pec-tacular is back.

08:13.991 --> 08:17.989
É ( Applause )

08:17.990 --> 08:18.990
Sweet!

08:18.991 --> 08:22.989
Sitting here looking at

08:22.990 --> 08:23.990
Mr. pec-tacular and I look over

08:23.990 --> 08:24.990
and my girlfriend and her sister

08:24.991 --> 08:26.699
are drooling over the guy.

08:26.700 --> 08:27.989
Are you for real?

08:27.990 --> 08:30.289
This guy has no layers.

08:30.290 --> 08:31.989
He has no depth.

08:31.990 --> 08:33.829
He's also, like, five feet tall.

08:33.830 --> 08:35.989
Today we're blending two

08:35.990 --> 08:38.989
great things, ballet and bowling

08:38.990 --> 08:41.989
in a little game "Big Brother"

08:41.990 --> 08:42.990
calls bowlerina.

08:42.991 --> 08:44.989
I will draw the names to

08:44.990 --> 08:45.990
determine the order in which you

08:45.990 --> 08:46.990
will compete.

08:46.990 --> 08:47.990
The goal is to knock down all

08:47.991 --> 08:49.999
four of your bowling pins before

08:50.000 --> 08:52.989
your opponent.

08:52.990 --> 08:53.990
But, a gate blocks your Lane.

08:53.990 --> 08:54.990
Oh!

08:54.990 --> 08:55.990
To lower your gate, hold on

08:55.991 --> 08:59.989
to the handle and spin 15 times.

08:59.990 --> 09:01.699
After 15 spins, the gate will

09:01.700 --> 09:02.989
lower for 15 seconds.

09:02.990 --> 09:04.989
This is your chance to bowl down

09:04.990 --> 09:07.119
all four of your pins.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.989
After the 15 seconds, the gate

09:08.990 --> 09:10.699
will pop back up, and you'll

09:10.700 --> 09:11.989
have to spin again to get more

09:11.990 --> 09:13.289
bowling time.

09:13.290 --> 09:16.409
The last player standing will

09:16.410 --> 09:19.989
win the power of veto.

09:19.990 --> 09:22.989
É ( Cheers )

09:22.990 --> 09:24.989
Now I will draw names to

09:24.990 --> 09:28.999
determine the order you will

09:29.000 --> 09:30.409
compete.

09:30.410 --> 09:34.989
Liz, Julia, John, Vanessa.

09:34.990 --> 09:36.119
Coming into this competition,

09:36.120 --> 09:37.989
I know Austin and the twins need

09:37.990 --> 09:38.990
to get broken up so really I

09:38.991 --> 09:40.989
want nominations to state same.

09:40.990 --> 09:42.829
Steve!

09:42.830 --> 09:43.989
And Austin!

09:43.990 --> 09:45.989
Jessie's picked the order of

09:45.990 --> 09:48.989
the players, and this veto

09:48.990 --> 09:49.990
competition is perfect.

09:49.991 --> 09:51.989
If we can eliminate John,

09:51.990 --> 09:52.990
Vanessa, and Steve, we can throw

09:52.991 --> 09:55.989
this competition to Julia and we

09:55.990 --> 09:55.991
are golden.

09:55.991 --> 10:00.539
Who is ready to blai bowl

10:00.540 --> 10:00.990
rina!

10:00.990 --> 10:01.990
All right, Liz, who would you

10:01.991 --> 10:03.289
like to challenge in the first

10:03.290 --> 10:04.989
bowl rina match-up.

10:04.990 --> 10:06.989
Being on the block next to

10:06.990 --> 10:07.990
Austin absolutely sucks, but if

10:07.991 --> 10:09.989
I make it through this, Steve,

10:09.990 --> 10:11.829
you better sleep with one eye

10:11.830 --> 10:14.989
open because you are our numero

10:14.990 --> 10:16.989
uno target.

10:16.990 --> 10:18.829
My boy, Steve!

10:18.830 --> 10:19.989
Going into this veto

10:19.990 --> 10:20.990
competition, my worst fear is

10:20.991 --> 10:22.989
I'm going to be put in a spot

10:22.990 --> 10:24.989
where I'm forced to nominate

10:24.990 --> 10:25.540
John or Vanessa.

10:25.541 --> 10:26.989
I don't care what happens today

10:26.990 --> 10:28.829
as long as Julia doesn't win.

10:28.830 --> 10:36.830
Ready, set, bowl!

10:38.990 --> 10:40.989
In this veto competition we

10:40.990 --> 10:41.990
have to spin around 15 times in

10:41.991 --> 10:43.989
order to get 15 seconds of

10:43.990 --> 10:44.990
bowling time.

10:44.990 --> 10:45.000
Whoa!

10:45.001 --> 10:46.989
And bowl our little bowling ball

10:46.990 --> 10:48.989
up the ramp and try to knock

10:48.990 --> 10:49.990
down four pins as fast as

10:49.990 --> 10:50.990
possible.

10:50.991 --> 10:53.989
If the gate closes, we have to

10:53.990 --> 10:54.990
respin to open it back up to

10:54.991 --> 10:56.989
knock down the remaining pins.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.989
I'm not the best bowler, but I

10:58.990 --> 11:00.989
just want to throw them as

11:00.990 --> 11:05.989
fastly and quickly as possible.

11:05.990 --> 11:08.989
So I'm spinning and I'm

11:08.990 --> 11:10.409
spinning and I'm feeling pretty

11:10.410 --> 11:11.989
good when I'm spinning and then

11:11.990 --> 11:14.989
I stop and it's like uh-oh.

11:14.990 --> 11:14.991
Holy!

11:14.991 --> 11:15.990
Oh, my God.

11:15.991 --> 11:19.989
Oh, my God!

11:19.990 --> 11:21.119
Steve's falling really wasn't

11:21.120 --> 11:21.990
that bad.

11:21.990 --> 11:22.990
It was very greeceful.

11:22.991 --> 11:26.699
I mean, all he defense fall off

11:26.700 --> 11:27.829
bowling alley completely.

11:27.830 --> 11:29.989
Oh, geez!

11:29.990 --> 11:31.989
I eventually stumble my way over

11:31.990 --> 11:33.989
to the bowling alley, and I know

11:33.990 --> 11:35.989
I can't aim at this point so I'm

11:35.990 --> 11:37.989
thinking just get as many balls

11:37.990 --> 11:45.990
up as I can.

11:47.830 --> 11:55.830
Go, Liz, go, go, go!

12:06.990 --> 12:08.989
Come on, two down one more,

12:08.990 --> 12:16.539
come on!

12:16.540 --> 12:17.989
Come on, two more, Liz, let's

12:17.990 --> 12:22.989
go!

12:22.990 --> 12:30.990
One more!

12:32.990 --> 12:34.989
Come on, Liz, go!

12:34.990 --> 12:35.990
Come on!

12:35.991 --> 12:37.989
Steve and Liz are both tied

12:37.990 --> 12:39.829
with one pin left to go, and

12:39.830 --> 12:41.989
this is too close to call.

12:41.990 --> 12:42.990
She just have to hit this pin

12:42.991 --> 12:44.119
and he is out and we still have

12:44.120 --> 12:45.989
a chance to survive.

12:45.990 --> 12:46.990
Come oliz!

12:46.990 --> 12:47.990
Come on, Liz!

12:47.991 --> 12:49.989
Come on!

12:49.990 --> 12:51.539
Come on, Liz!

12:51.540 --> 12:54.989
Come on, hurry.

12:54.990 --> 12:55.540
Yes!

12:55.540 --> 12:55.990
Yes!

12:55.990 --> 12:56.990
Good job, Liz.

12:56.990 --> 12:57.990
Good job!

12:57.991 --> 12:59.989
Liz wins the first match.

12:59.990 --> 13:01.989
I'm sorry, Steve.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.989
Valiant effort, but you lost.

13:03.990 --> 13:04.990
I did.

13:04.991 --> 13:06.989
I lost this round, really no

13:06.990 --> 13:07.000
surprise.

13:07.001 --> 13:08.989
I'm not going to win any

13:08.990 --> 13:09.990
competition involving spinning.

13:09.991 --> 13:11.989
I would prefer either John or

13:11.990 --> 13:12.990
Vanessa wins because that puts

13:12.991 --> 13:14.999
everything in my control, but if

13:15.000 --> 13:17.989
Liz or Austin wins I'm not going

13:17.990 --> 13:17.991
to complain.

13:17.991 --> 13:20.539
It's just not Julia.

13:20.540 --> 13:22.989
It's time for round two.

13:22.990 --> 13:24.989
Julia, who would you like to

13:24.990 --> 13:26.699
challenge in the bowlarina

13:26.700 --> 13:32.989
match?

13:32.990 --> 13:34.989
Vanessa is whispering to

13:34.990 --> 13:36.989
Julia, hey, pick Austin.

13:36.990 --> 13:39.119
I'm just thinking, oh, my God,

13:39.120 --> 13:40.989
Vanessa, if you pull this off,

13:40.990 --> 13:41.990
you're a genius.

13:41.990 --> 13:42.990
You're having them eat their

13:42.990 --> 13:42.991
own.

13:42.991 --> 13:50.991
This is amazing.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.989
I would like to challenge

13:52.990 --> 13:55.989
Austin.

13:55.990 --> 14:03.990
( Applause )

14:06.990 --> 14:08.829
Julia picks me?

14:08.830 --> 14:09.989
What is happening right now?

14:09.990 --> 14:11.989
She should be picking John.

14:11.990 --> 14:13.989
Am I being played by my

14:13.990 --> 14:14.990
girlfriend and her twin sister?

14:14.991 --> 14:16.989
Is this the conspiracy by the

14:16.990 --> 14:17.990
whole house?

14:17.990 --> 14:18.830
Am I target?

14:18.830 --> 14:19.830
What is going on?

14:31.990 --> 14:32.990
I don't know.

14:32.991 --> 14:34.989
The worst thing that could

14:34.990 --> 14:35.990
happen for my game would be for

14:35.991 --> 14:37.989
Julia to win the veto and use it

14:37.990 --> 14:38.990
to take Liz off the block

14:38.991 --> 14:40.989
because then that only leaves

14:40.990 --> 14:44.989
Johnny mack or I to go up as

14:44.990 --> 14:46.989
replacement nominee.

14:46.990 --> 14:50.989
What's the worst-case

14:50.990 --> 14:50.991
scenario?

14:50.991 --> 14:53.829
If Austin wins, that's your

14:53.830 --> 14:55.989
worst-case scenario.

14:55.990 --> 14:57.989
So you need to pick him.

14:57.990 --> 14:58.990
You understand?

14:58.991 --> 15:00.989
Think about it.

15:00.990 --> 15:02.119
I'm listening to her, but I

15:02.120 --> 15:04.989
do not think that was Julia's

15:04.990 --> 15:05.990
smartest choice.

15:05.991 --> 15:07.699
It just seems like Vanessa is

15:07.700 --> 15:08.989
watching out for her own game

15:08.990 --> 15:10.989
and it's not really rubbing me

15:10.990 --> 15:11.990
the right way.

15:11.991 --> 15:13.989
You're getting played.

15:13.990 --> 15:15.999
I shouldn't have picked you

15:16.000 --> 15:16.700
upon.

15:16.700 --> 15:17.000
I'm sorry.

15:17.001 --> 15:18.989
I'm really not sure I made the

15:18.990 --> 15:20.289
right move to challenge Austin

15:20.290 --> 15:20.990
rather than Johnny Mac.

15:20.990 --> 15:21.990
You know, I listened to Vanessa

15:21.991 --> 15:23.989
at the last minute.

15:23.990 --> 15:25.989
She told me to trust her and I

15:25.990 --> 15:26.290
did.

15:26.290 --> 15:26.990
I'm really in a bad situation

15:26.990 --> 15:27.990
right now.

15:27.991 --> 15:29.289
This made no sense.

15:29.290 --> 15:30.989
I wanted Julia to take on Johnny

15:30.990 --> 15:31.990
Mac, and then I could have

15:31.990 --> 15:32.990
thrown it to her.

15:32.991 --> 15:34.989
I feel like Julia just betrayed

15:34.990 --> 15:36.989
me, everyone's in on it, I'm the

15:36.990 --> 15:37.700
target.

15:37.701 --> 15:38.989
If there was ever a moment where

15:38.990 --> 15:40.989
Judas takes over, right now is

15:40.990 --> 15:41.410
the time.

15:41.411 --> 15:43.539
I have to win this veto.

15:43.540 --> 15:51.540
Ready, set, bowl!

15:53.990 --> 15:56.989
This is like my worst

15:56.989 --> 15:57.989
First of all, I don't know who

15:57.990 --> 15:59.989
to root for, and I feel like

15:59.990 --> 16:00.990
they're competing against each

16:00.991 --> 16:02.829
other way too early in this

16:02.830 --> 16:02.990
comp.

16:02.991 --> 16:09.989
You got tjulia!

16:09.990 --> 16:10.990
Go!

16:10.991 --> 16:18.991
Austin, go!

16:21.990 --> 16:23.989
You got one!

16:23.990 --> 16:31.990
Go, go!

16:34.700 --> 16:36.989
You got it, Julia!

16:36.990 --> 16:38.989
Go!

16:38.990 --> 16:39.410
More to the right!

16:39.411 --> 16:42.989
More to the right!

16:42.990 --> 16:48.989
Come on, just shoot!

16:48.990 --> 16:56.990
Yes, one more!

17:07.540 --> 17:08.989
Austin wins the round.

17:08.990 --> 17:12.989
Sorry, Julia, you've been

17:12.990 --> 17:12.991
eliminated.

17:12.991 --> 17:14.989
Why did you pick Austin?

17:14.990 --> 17:16.699
I don't know.

17:16.700 --> 17:17.999
I have absolutely no idea why

17:18.000 --> 17:19.989
Julia that you want picking

17:19.990 --> 17:20.990
Austin would be a good idea.

17:20.991 --> 17:22.699
But, hey, Julia is out of the

17:22.700 --> 17:24.989
competition, and Julia winning

17:24.990 --> 17:26.989
was my worst-case scenario, so,

17:26.990 --> 17:32.699
hey, it works for me.

17:32.700 --> 17:40.700
Lawyer

17:40.990 --> 17:42.989
right now anyone could play

17:42.990 --> 17:43.410
against me.

17:43.411 --> 17:45.989
The fact that Vanessa is chiming

17:45.990 --> 17:46.999
right now defending Julia for

17:47.000 --> 17:48.989
picking me makes me believe I

17:48.990 --> 17:50.989
have to win this veto more than

17:50.990 --> 17:50.991
ever.

17:50.991 --> 17:52.409
Johnny Mac, step on up.

17:52.410 --> 17:53.989
John, who would you like to

17:53.990 --> 17:56.989
challenge in the next bowlarina

17:56.990 --> 17:56.991
match?

17:56.991 --> 17:58.989
Coming into this veto

17:58.990 --> 17:59.990
competition, Austin was my

17:59.991 --> 18:01.699
target, but now that Vanessa has

18:01.700 --> 18:02.540
pulled this crazy move and

18:02.541 --> 18:03.989
created all this tension with

18:03.990 --> 18:05.989
Austin, I think it's better for

18:05.990 --> 18:07.989
my game figet one of the twins

18:07.990 --> 18:08.990
out this week.

18:08.991 --> 18:12.119
Liz, let's bowl some balls.

18:12.120 --> 18:13.539
Liz, step on up!

18:13.540 --> 18:15.989
I'm take you out of this veto

18:15.990 --> 18:15.991
competition.

18:15.991 --> 18:23.991
Ready, set, bowl!

18:26.990 --> 18:28.989
When I'm spinning I spin a

18:28.990 --> 18:30.989
little slower so I make sure I'm

18:30.990 --> 18:31.990
not so busy and make the balls

18:31.991 --> 18:35.999
that I roll count.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.989
Come on!

18:38.990 --> 18:46.990
Harder, Liz!

18:50.990 --> 18:51.990
Hustle!

18:51.991 --> 18:52.990
One more!

18:52.991 --> 18:58.989
Go, go, go!

18:58.990 --> 19:02.119
And Johnny Mac's the winner.

19:02.120 --> 19:02.990
Nice try.

19:02.991 --> 19:04.999
I feel absolutely defeated.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.989
I just wanted myself and my

19:06.990 --> 19:07.990
sister to win.

19:07.991 --> 19:10.539
I just want this day to be over.

19:10.540 --> 19:13.989
All right, Vanessa, it's your

19:13.990 --> 19:13.991
turn.

19:13.991 --> 19:17.989
Who do you wish to challenge?

19:17.990 --> 19:19.829
So it's round four and I have

19:19.830 --> 19:20.989
to choose between John and

19:20.990 --> 19:21.990
Austin.

19:21.991 --> 19:23.289
I gotta choose Austin because

19:23.290 --> 19:24.989
that's only way nominations are

19:24.990 --> 19:25.990
going to stay the same at this

19:25.990 --> 19:26.990
point.

19:26.990 --> 19:26.998
Austin.

19:26.999 --> 19:27.990
( Applause ).

19:27.991 --> 19:29.539
Once again, I feel betrayed.

19:29.540 --> 19:30.410
Vanessa, you're supposed to be

19:30.411 --> 19:31.989
working with me, not against me.

19:31.990 --> 19:32.990
I see nothing but red.

19:32.991 --> 19:35.989
I'm going to destroy Vanessa.

19:35.990 --> 19:36.990
Good luck, Austin.

19:36.991 --> 19:44.991
Thank you.

19:51.290 --> 19:53.989
Austin's just like some

19:53.990 --> 19:55.989
enraged gorilla just moving

19:55.990 --> 19:57.699
along the ground there on his

19:57.700 --> 19:58.989
hands and knees.

19:58.990 --> 19:59.990
It's funny looking but it's

19:59.991 --> 20:07.991
pretty cool to watch.

20:12.990 --> 20:14.289
And Austin wins!

20:14.290 --> 20:14.990
Good job.

20:14.990 --> 20:15.990
Thank you.

20:15.991 --> 20:18.989
Sorry, Vanessa, you've been

20:18.990 --> 20:18.991
eliminated.

20:18.991 --> 20:21.989
I didn't even make a pin.

20:21.990 --> 20:21.991
That's sad.

20:21.991 --> 20:23.989
It all comes down to this,

20:23.990 --> 20:26.989
Johnny Mac and Austin.

20:26.990 --> 20:27.990
Let's do this!

20:27.991 --> 20:32.989
Come on, Austin!

20:32.990 --> 20:34.289
It's round five, it's down to

20:34.290 --> 20:35.989
myself and Johnny Mac for the

20:35.989 --> 20:36.989
I shake his hand, look him in

20:36.990 --> 20:38.989
the eye and say, "I want this."

20:38.990 --> 20:40.539
And I'm hoping he lets me have

20:40.540 --> 20:42.119
it.

20:42.120 --> 20:43.989
This is awesome!

20:43.990 --> 20:47.989
Austin wants to take out one of

20:47.990 --> 20:49.539
the twins is essentially what

20:49.540 --> 20:50.989
he's saying to me right now.

20:50.990 --> 20:51.990
Sure I'm going to do it.

20:51.991 --> 20:53.989
Austin, take the veto, save

20:53.990 --> 20:55.989
yourself, and I'll see you next

20:55.990 --> 21:03.990
week.

21:09.540 --> 21:10.699
One down!

21:10.700 --> 21:12.989
Two!

21:12.990 --> 21:14.989
Three, one more, one more,

21:14.990 --> 21:19.989
hurry!

21:19.990 --> 21:20.990
Oh!

21:20.991 --> 21:23.949
Bam!

21:23.950 --> 21:23.990
Yeah!

21:23.991 --> 21:24.990
Judas is here.

21:24.990 --> 21:25.990
All of you!

21:25.990 --> 21:26.990
What?

21:26.991 --> 21:29.699
All of you be afraid.

21:29.700 --> 21:30.989
Choice words from Austin.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.829
Austin's not here anymore.

21:32.830 --> 21:39.989
He's gone.

21:39.990 --> 21:40.990
Congratulations, Austin.

21:40.991 --> 21:43.989
You have won the golden power of

21:43.990 --> 21:44.410
veto.

21:44.411 --> 21:47.989
How fitting is this?

21:47.990 --> 21:47.991
Mr. pec-tacular.

21:47.991 --> 21:49.989
Look what I found.

21:49.990 --> 21:51.119
Juiceas just won the power of

21:51.120 --> 21:51.990
veto.

21:51.990 --> 21:52.990
And you know what that means?

21:52.991 --> 21:54.989
This entire house needs to be

21:54.990 --> 21:55.990
afraid.

21:55.991 --> 21:57.989
Because I feel betrayed, and I

21:57.990 --> 22:00.989
am safe.

22:00.990 --> 22:01.990
Austin wins and I am not a

22:01.991 --> 22:03.989
fan of his reaction.

22:03.990 --> 22:06.989
He makes it seem like he is this

22:06.990 --> 22:07.990
completely different person.

22:07.991 --> 22:09.989
You don't react like that when

22:09.990 --> 22:11.989
your girl is on the block and

22:11.990 --> 22:13.989
now you're just rubbing it in my

22:13.990 --> 22:14.830
face.

22:14.831 --> 22:15.989
Who wants to congratulate me?

22:15.990 --> 22:20.989
I will congratulate you.

22:20.990 --> 22:21.990
Austin wins the power of

22:21.990 --> 22:22.700
veto.

22:22.701 --> 22:23.829
Although I'm not nervous about

22:23.830 --> 22:24.989
being the replacement nominee, I

22:24.990 --> 22:26.989
am a little nervous about

22:26.990 --> 22:27.990
Austin's reaction to Julia

22:27.989 --> 22:29.119
I know at this point, I'm going

22:29.120 --> 22:30.989
to have to head inside and do

22:30.990 --> 22:33.989
some major damage control.

22:33.990 --> 22:35.999
, of course, , of course.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.989
Oh!

22:37.990 --> 22:37.991
( Applause ).

22:37.991 --> 22:41.989
Whooo!

22:41.990 --> 22:43.989
Austin, you have... you have

22:43.990 --> 22:44.990
some work to do.

22:59.410 --> 23:04.989
I just won
the power of veto. Judas is in
this house to stay.

23:04.990 --> 23:05.999
And everybody who was maybe in

23:06.000 --> 23:09.989
on a plan to take me out is

23:09.990 --> 23:10.999
gonna have to live in fear.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.999
I'm going to findo exactly why

23:13.000 --> 23:14.989
Julia did what she did out

23:14.990 --> 23:15.410
there.

23:15.411 --> 23:18.989
Controversy, I love it.

23:18.990 --> 23:20.989
You're so dumb.

23:20.990 --> 23:22.989
I can't believe did you that.

23:22.990 --> 23:25.829
Because John wfd to go next.

23:25.830 --> 23:26.989
He would have had to go twice in

23:26.990 --> 23:26.991
a row.

23:26.991 --> 23:27.990
What's wrong with you?

23:27.991 --> 23:29.989
I'm sorry, she was just like,

23:29.990 --> 23:31.989
"if he wins, you're going up,

23:31.990 --> 23:32.990
you're going up, trust me."

23:32.990 --> 23:33.990
And I trusted her.

23:33.991 --> 23:37.949
I can't believe you did that.

23:37.950 --> 23:38.989
We're going to be up there

23:38.990 --> 23:39.540
together.

23:39.540 --> 23:40.540
I never should have listened

23:40.540 --> 23:40.990
to Vanessa.

23:40.990 --> 23:41.990
I'm sorry.

23:41.991 --> 23:43.989
This is, like, the worst

23:43.990 --> 23:45.119
feeling in the world.

23:45.120 --> 23:46.989
Why did you do that?

23:46.990 --> 23:48.989
The second round you take me

23:48.990 --> 23:49.990
out.

23:49.991 --> 23:51.989
All we had to do was be the last

23:51.990 --> 23:52.990
three people left and we could

23:52.990 --> 23:53.990
have thrown it to you.

23:53.991 --> 23:55.409
What were you thinking?

23:55.410 --> 23:57.989
Because Vanessa...

23:57.990 --> 23:58.990
she played you.

23:58.990 --> 23:59.990
Oh, my God.

23:59.991 --> 24:02.949
I thought it was a big setup

24:02.950 --> 24:04.989
with everybody to try to take me

24:04.990 --> 24:05.290
out.

24:05.291 --> 24:13.291
You got played in public.

24:13.410 --> 24:15.829
I'm not quite sure if Vanessa

24:15.830 --> 24:15.990
just played me.

24:15.991 --> 24:17.989
I have my sister pissed at me

24:17.990 --> 24:19.989
for not challenging John, and

24:19.990 --> 24:21.949
I'm really in a bad situation

24:21.950 --> 24:22.950
right now.

24:22.951 --> 24:26.989
It sucks.

24:26.990 --> 24:27.990
I'm really sad.

24:27.990 --> 24:28.990
I feel like I got played.

24:28.990 --> 24:29.990
By me?

24:29.990 --> 24:30.990
Girl, you understand what's

24:30.990 --> 24:31.990
going to happen now, right?

24:31.990 --> 24:32.990
I'm going to the block.

24:32.991 --> 24:34.539
Exactly.

24:34.540 --> 24:36.989
Was that not your worst-case

24:36.990 --> 24:37.700
scenario?

24:37.701 --> 24:39.949
But fiwould have gotten out

24:39.950 --> 24:40.989
John they probably would have

24:40.990 --> 24:41.990
thrown it to me?

24:41.991 --> 24:43.989
They wouldn't have.

24:43.990 --> 24:45.539
Why would Austin do that?

24:45.540 --> 24:46.989
I know you think you have a

24:46.990 --> 24:47.999
good point but literally what

24:48.000 --> 24:49.989
she did was so stupid.

24:49.990 --> 24:50.990
If she picked Johnny Mac he

24:50.990 --> 24:51.990
would have had to go twice in a

24:51.991 --> 24:54.989
low and he would have been

24:54.990 --> 24:56.989
eliminated and he could have

24:56.990 --> 25:04.990
thrown it to her.

25:11.410 --> 25:12.989
Man, the twins are coming at

25:12.990 --> 25:14.949
me like I played them.

25:14.950 --> 25:15.989
I have to defuse the situation

25:15.990 --> 25:23.990
right away.

25:50.990 --> 25:52.989
Steve, not now, please, not

25:52.990 --> 25:53.410
now.

25:53.410 --> 25:54.000
Not now, Steve.

25:54.001 --> 26:02.001
Go away.

26:10.990 --> 26:12.989
Despite what Austin says in

26:12.990 --> 26:13.990
front of the twins I've had

26:13.990 --> 26:14.990
conversations him over the past

26:14.991 --> 26:16.539
couple of weeks where he's told

26:16.540 --> 26:18.289
me not only is he okay with one

26:18.290 --> 26:19.989
of the twins going home but it's

26:19.990 --> 26:21.989
actually in his best interest.

26:21.990 --> 26:22.990
I'm telling you, you don't have

26:22.990 --> 26:23.990
all the information.

26:23.991 --> 26:28.989
I do.

26:28.990 --> 26:33.989
Does that scare you?

26:33.990 --> 26:35.949
Do you think he would have

26:35.950 --> 26:36.989
thrown it to you?

26:36.990 --> 26:38.989
You fell on your head.

26:38.990 --> 26:40.989
If he was going to throw it to

26:40.990 --> 26:42.989
you, why didn't he throw it to

26:42.990 --> 26:42.991
you?

26:42.991 --> 26:44.989
Why department he?

26:44.990 --> 26:46.699
Wait, yeah, that's true.

26:46.700 --> 26:47.989
Why didn't he throw it to me.

26:47.990 --> 26:50.989
He could have thrown it to

26:50.990 --> 26:50.991
you.

26:50.991 --> 26:57.409
He's a liar, that's why.

26:57.410 --> 26:59.989
Do you think he wants Liz out

26:59.990 --> 27:00.990
so he can make it further?

27:00.991 --> 27:03.989
No, ideally, you, but one of

27:03.990 --> 27:08.989
you guys.

27:08.990 --> 27:13.829
I don't trut him and I never

27:13.830 --> 27:13.990
have.

27:13.991 --> 27:15.989
Me, either.

27:15.990 --> 27:16.990
You're staying?

27:16.990 --> 27:17.410
Oh, Liz.

27:17.411 --> 27:18.829
100%.

27:18.830 --> 27:20.699
Who is going to keep her?

27:20.700 --> 27:21.989
You know, it just sucks

27:21.990 --> 27:22.990
because I'm not going to

27:22.991 --> 27:24.989
campaign against her, and he's

27:24.990 --> 27:26.989
going to do everything can to

27:26.990 --> 27:27.120
campaign against me.

27:27.121 --> 27:28.989
I can tell you, I'm so close

27:28.990 --> 27:30.989
to spilling the beans, I am so

27:30.990 --> 27:31.990
close.

27:39.700 --> 27:47.700
Be a fly on the wall

28:03.990 --> 28:04.990
were you, like, hiding stuff

28:04.991 --> 28:07.989
from me?

28:07.990 --> 28:08.990
Is that what Vanessa has been

28:08.990 --> 28:09.990
telling you?

28:09.991 --> 28:11.989
No, but she's like, "I have

28:11.990 --> 28:13.989
so much information on him."

28:13.990 --> 28:14.990
Information on me, really.

28:14.991 --> 28:16.989
She set the whole thing up to

28:16.990 --> 28:19.989
take me out this week and keep

28:19.990 --> 28:20.990
you two here.

28:20.991 --> 28:23.989
I knew, this you knew this

28:23.990 --> 28:24.990
beforehand didn't you?

28:24.991 --> 28:27.989
No, are you kidding me?

28:27.990 --> 28:29.949
Why did she pick you?

28:29.950 --> 28:30.989
I don't know.

28:30.990 --> 28:31.990
I thought she was going to pick

28:31.991 --> 28:35.989
Johnny Mac.

28:35.990 --> 28:36.990
Is there something, like,

28:36.991 --> 28:38.989
that I don't know about you that

28:38.990 --> 28:39.990
Vanessa knows and I don't.

28:39.991 --> 28:41.989
No.

28:41.990 --> 28:43.989
I will do everything in my power

28:43.990 --> 28:45.289
to protect three people.

28:45.290 --> 28:49.989
It almost cost me my game this

28:49.989 --> 28:50.989
If I sat in the room with the

28:50.990 --> 28:54.989
h.O.H. And they said will you be

28:54.990 --> 28:56.989
absolutely ( Bleep ) If we take

28:56.990 --> 28:58.539
out one of the girls this week?

28:58.540 --> 28:59.989
What am I supposed to say, yes,

28:59.990 --> 29:00.990
take me out?

29:00.991 --> 29:02.989
No, I gotta play ball.

29:02.990 --> 29:08.989
Why didn't you tell me this.

29:08.990 --> 29:11.989
Or me!

29:11.990 --> 29:12.990
One of the three of us.

29:12.991 --> 29:15.989
Julia just sealed your own fate.

29:15.990 --> 29:16.990
Shierks I just don't know what

29:16.991 --> 29:20.119
to think right now.

29:20.120 --> 29:22.289
I'm going to shower.

29:22.290 --> 29:25.989
Wait, wait, wait.

29:25.990 --> 29:28.989
I'm, like, honestly, I'm over

29:28.990 --> 29:29.700
this.

29:29.700 --> 29:30.000
You're over it?

29:30.001 --> 29:34.989
Yeah.

29:34.990 --> 29:36.989
I'm just gonna leave this

29:36.990 --> 29:40.989
game with integrity.

29:40.990 --> 29:42.989
If it's my time to go, it's my

29:42.990 --> 29:44.989
time to go, and I will go with

29:44.990 --> 29:45.990
my head high.

29:45.991 --> 29:49.989
That's not, 000 works around

29:49.990 --> 29:57.990
here.

30:00.990 --> 30:02.289
I don't know what to think

30:02.290 --> 30:03.120
about him.

30:03.121 --> 30:04.989
I'm, like, literally, I don't...

30:04.990 --> 30:05.999
he wasn't going to throw it

30:06.000 --> 30:07.989
to me, Liz.

30:07.990 --> 30:08.990
He couldn't have.

30:08.991 --> 30:11.289
You win, that's his worst-case

30:11.290 --> 30:12.989
scenario, he end up on the block

30:12.990 --> 30:13.990
next to Julia and goes home.

30:13.991 --> 30:14.999
Did you think he was going to

30:15.000 --> 30:17.289
use the veto on you?

30:17.290 --> 30:18.989
Uh-huh, maybe.

30:18.990 --> 30:20.949
I think that's what hurts the

30:20.950 --> 30:23.989
most.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.539
Well, let me just tell you, I

30:25.540 --> 30:25.990
learned a lot today.

30:25.991 --> 30:28.989
I learned that he's pretty

30:28.990 --> 30:29.990
selfish.

30:29.991 --> 30:33.829
And he's no Clay.

30:33.830 --> 30:36.409
He is not a knight in shining

30:36.410 --> 30:37.989
armor.

30:37.990 --> 30:38.990
So...

30:38.991 --> 30:39.999
yeah, that's why I don't

30:40.000 --> 30:41.989
trust him.

30:41.990 --> 30:43.989
I just literally want to,

30:43.990 --> 30:45.989
just, like, never talk to him

30:45.990 --> 30:53.990
again.

30:55.950 --> 30:58.949
Oix hi, John.

30:58.950 --> 30:59.950
Anything interesting going on

30:59.950 --> 30:59.990
down there?

30:59.991 --> 31:02.989
Everyone is arguing in the

31:02.989 --> 31:03.989
That's good, first of all,

31:03.990 --> 31:04.830
because they're going to take

31:04.831 --> 31:05.989
out one of their own.

31:05.990 --> 31:06.990
Vanessa was telling everyone

31:06.990 --> 31:07.990
who to pick?

31:07.991 --> 31:09.989
She was telling Julia to take

31:09.990 --> 31:10.290
out Austin.

31:10.291 --> 31:12.989
Because if Austin wins, Julia

31:12.990 --> 31:13.990
goes up.

31:13.991 --> 31:15.989
Yeah, to take Julia out of

31:15.990 --> 31:16.990
the game to protect Vanessa

31:16.990 --> 31:17.990
because Vanessa knew she would

31:17.991 --> 31:19.409
go up if Julia won this thing.

31:19.410 --> 31:20.989
Now is when we stay the

31:20.990 --> 31:21.990
( bleep ) Out of it.

31:21.991 --> 31:23.989
On the one hand I'm really happy

31:23.990 --> 31:25.989
Vanessa got Julia to pick

31:25.990 --> 31:25.991
Austin.

31:25.991 --> 31:28.989
It works out great in my favor.

31:28.990 --> 31:29.999
On the other hand, Vanessa has

31:30.000 --> 31:31.989
her hands in a lot of different

31:31.990 --> 31:33.539
cookie jars, she's have been

31:33.540 --> 31:34.989
manipulative and persuasive.

31:34.990 --> 31:36.989
I'm really nervous about what

31:36.990 --> 31:38.699
she's capable of moving forward

31:38.700 --> 31:39.989
and she's not someone I want to

31:39.990 --> 31:41.989
be sitting next to in the final

31:41.990 --> 31:42.990
two.

31:42.990 --> 31:43.990
One thing we don't have to

31:43.991 --> 31:47.289
worry about is a Vanessa-Austin

31:47.290 --> 31:47.990
final two.

31:47.990 --> 31:48.990
Right.

31:48.991 --> 31:50.989
They hate each other right now.

31:50.990 --> 31:52.989
Do you like my bath robe?

31:52.990 --> 31:54.989
Hey, you should wear this some

31:54.990 --> 31:55.830
time, bucko.

31:55.831 --> 32:00.989
Next week.

32:00.990 --> 32:04.409
It doesn't make any sense.

32:04.410 --> 32:05.989
He had no intention of ever

32:05.990 --> 32:06.120
throwing it to you.

32:06.121 --> 32:08.989
I had no intention of what?

32:08.990 --> 32:10.989
All I know is that it was just a

32:10.990 --> 32:11.990
really tough situation all

32:11.990 --> 32:11.991
around.

32:11.991 --> 32:12.990
It was going to be...

32:12.991 --> 32:14.989
I already hate the idea of

32:14.990 --> 32:16.989
being a pawn to send my

32:16.990 --> 32:17.700
( bleep ) Girlfriend home.

32:17.701 --> 32:18.989
That's the sickest thing in my

32:18.990 --> 32:19.990
stomach.

32:19.991 --> 32:21.829
And I hate that she thinks it's

32:21.830 --> 32:22.989
Austin trying to take us out.

32:22.990 --> 32:25.989
You're allowed to win the

32:25.990 --> 32:26.000
game...

32:26.001 --> 32:28.829
if someone puts a gun to my

32:28.830 --> 32:30.989
had I play ball and try to save

32:30.990 --> 32:32.989
myself and hopefully save

32:32.990 --> 32:34.989
everyone or just walk out of the

32:34.990 --> 32:35.990
game like Clay.

32:35.991 --> 32:38.699
But no one respects that.

32:38.700 --> 32:39.989
Vanessa, can I talk to you alone

32:39.990 --> 32:41.989
in the parlor room, precinct

32:41.990 --> 32:42.290
please?

32:42.291 --> 32:44.989
Sure.

32:44.990 --> 32:45.999
Okay what, are you saying to

32:46.000 --> 32:46.990
them?

32:46.990 --> 32:47.990
I didn't say anything.

32:47.990 --> 32:48.830
I just sat there.

32:48.830 --> 32:49.540
They did the talking.

32:49.541 --> 32:50.989
Am I supposed to lay down?

32:50.990 --> 32:52.989
She did defend you, even

32:52.990 --> 32:54.989
though I think you're a piece of

32:54.990 --> 32:55.990
( bleep ) Right now?

32:55.990 --> 32:56.990
Why?

32:56.991 --> 32:58.989
You want to know why, have a

32:58.990 --> 32:58.991
seat.

32:58.991 --> 32:59.990
I want to yell.

32:59.990 --> 33:00.990
Frankly, your intention was to

33:00.990 --> 33:01.990
throw to Julia.

33:01.991 --> 33:04.989
You know what you're telling me?

33:04.990 --> 33:04.993
- What?
- >>

33:04.993 --> 33:06.539
why don't you do the math.

33:06.540 --> 33:07.989
Throw it to Julia, what was

33:07.990 --> 33:08.990
going to happen.

33:08.990 --> 33:09.990
What was going to happen,

33:09.990 --> 33:10.990
Austin, is I'm going to go up

33:10.990 --> 33:11.990
next to you.

33:11.991 --> 33:14.989
It should have been your damn

33:14.990 --> 33:15.990
worst-case scenario.

33:15.991 --> 33:17.829
Now you think I'm against

33:17.830 --> 33:17.990
you.

33:17.990 --> 33:18.990
That is a huge attack on me.

33:18.991 --> 33:21.829
And I had to use every ounce of

33:21.830 --> 33:22.989
self-control I had not to just

33:22.990 --> 33:23.990
vomit on the plate all the

33:23.991 --> 33:26.409
information I have.

33:26.410 --> 33:27.989
Un what, I'm sorry.

33:27.990 --> 33:29.989
I'm going to try my best to save

33:29.990 --> 33:30.990
all three of you.

33:30.991 --> 33:32.989
I'm frustrated as hell about

33:32.990 --> 33:33.990
what happened at the veto, but I

33:33.991 --> 33:35.289
have the veto and we're both

33:35.290 --> 33:35.990
staying in the house this week

33:35.991 --> 33:37.989
so I have to make nice with her.

33:37.990 --> 33:39.989
I'm not mad at you at all.

33:39.990 --> 33:42.989
I've been trying to play this up

33:42.990 --> 33:44.999
to keep us add odds.

33:45.000 --> 33:45.990
I'm loyal to you.

33:45.991 --> 33:47.989
I'm not telling Liz anything.

33:47.990 --> 33:49.989
All I want right now is for Liz

33:49.990 --> 33:51.989
not to think I'm doing anything

33:51.990 --> 33:52.990
bad to her because I love

33:52.991 --> 33:55.289
perhelp I can't lay over and

33:55.290 --> 33:55.990
die.

33:55.991 --> 33:57.989
I have a family, too.

33:57.990 --> 33:59.989
Every girls wants the fantasy

33:59.990 --> 34:00.990
of a prince charming...

34:00.991 --> 34:02.989
and I wish I wasn't on the

34:02.990 --> 34:03.990
block and I could use it on her.

34:03.991 --> 34:05.989
The reason I'm so mad is I'm

34:05.990 --> 34:06.990
going to be the agent that puts

34:06.991 --> 34:08.989
them up against each other, the

34:08.990 --> 34:09.990
last thing I ever wanted to

34:09.990 --> 34:10.990
happen happened in this game.

34:10.991 --> 34:15.989
Then why don't you use you

34:15.990 --> 34:16.990
not use the veto.

34:16.991 --> 34:24.991
Yeah, that's not happening.

34:33.990 --> 34:34.990
Hey.

34:34.991 --> 34:39.989
Hey.

34:39.990 --> 34:41.989
What's wrong?

34:41.990 --> 34:41.991
Nothing.

34:41.991 --> 34:42.990
Nothing?

34:42.991 --> 34:44.989
Anything I can do for you.

34:44.990 --> 34:46.989
I just want to be with my

34:46.990 --> 34:46.991
sister.

34:46.991 --> 34:49.119
Okay.

34:49.120 --> 34:50.989
I just hope you know that I was

34:50.990 --> 34:51.990
not trying to hurt you, and I

34:51.991 --> 34:53.989
had to just win it.

34:53.990 --> 34:54.990
And that's the worst feeling in

34:54.990 --> 34:55.990
the world.

34:55.991 --> 34:57.989
That's why I'm so angry.

34:57.990 --> 34:59.989
You know.

34:59.990 --> 35:04.409
I just feel like...

35:04.410 --> 35:05.120
what?

35:05.121 --> 35:08.289
Your reaction was everything.

35:08.290 --> 35:09.699
It proved a lot it me.

35:09.700 --> 35:10.989
What does that mean?

35:10.990 --> 35:12.989
I just want to let you know

35:12.990 --> 35:14.699
this probably isn't going to end

35:14.700 --> 35:14.990
well.

35:14.991 --> 35:17.989
So I'm just coming to terms with

35:17.990 --> 35:18.000
that, too.

35:18.001 --> 35:19.989
What do you mean?

35:19.990 --> 35:21.989
What does my reaction prove?

35:21.990 --> 35:23.119
I'm not lying to you.

35:23.120 --> 35:25.949
You're mad right now.

35:25.950 --> 35:29.989
Do you think I want... I wanted

35:29.990 --> 35:30.990
to protect you guys this whole

35:30.990 --> 35:31.990
thing.

35:31.990 --> 35:32.830
But I didn't know what was going

35:32.830 --> 35:32.990
on.

35:32.991 --> 35:34.989
I don't know what to believe,

35:34.990 --> 35:36.989
though.

35:36.990 --> 35:40.289
Liz, I love you.

35:40.290 --> 35:42.989
Oh, my God.

35:42.990 --> 35:44.989
( Sighs )

35:44.990 --> 35:48.989
I don't... I've done everything I

35:48.990 --> 35:50.989
could to protect you guys.

35:50.990 --> 35:52.409
Okay.

35:52.410 --> 35:54.829
Austin is trying to make it seem

35:54.830 --> 35:56.989
like he is my knight in shining

35:56.990 --> 35:56.991
armor.

35:56.991 --> 35:58.949
But, look, I've won more

35:58.950 --> 35:59.540
h.O.H.S than you.

35:59.541 --> 36:01.289
So I don't need you to come here

36:01.290 --> 36:02.989
and say you've tried to protect

36:02.990 --> 36:03.990
me this entire time.

36:03.991 --> 36:05.539
I don't need you anymore.

36:05.540 --> 36:07.989
And, clearly, you know this is...

36:07.990 --> 36:09.989
this is... this might be the end

36:09.990 --> 36:11.989
for us.

36:11.990 --> 36:13.119
What do you think I'm

36:13.120 --> 36:14.289
thinking out there when I'm

36:14.290 --> 36:15.989
sitting there and all of a

36:15.990 --> 36:17.989
sudden Julia picks me and I look

36:17.990 --> 36:18.990
over and everyone is looking

36:18.990 --> 36:19.990
weird is and everyone is rooting

36:19.990 --> 36:20.990
for Julia.

36:20.991 --> 36:23.989
I was like oh, my God, everyone

36:23.990 --> 36:25.289
was in on getting me out.

36:25.290 --> 36:26.989
This is week five all over

36:26.990 --> 36:26.991
again.

36:26.991 --> 36:28.999
Oh, please you're so full

36:29.000 --> 36:30.989
of... get out of here, please.

36:30.990 --> 36:32.989
Bragging about it in the

36:32.990 --> 36:32.991
bathroom.

36:32.991 --> 36:33.990
Really, Liz.

36:33.991 --> 36:35.989
You are so off base right now.

36:35.990 --> 36:37.989
I ruined my life for you.

36:37.990 --> 36:40.989
I chose you over a girl at home

36:40.990 --> 36:42.989
because I fell in love with you.

36:42.990 --> 36:43.990
I told you that.

36:43.991 --> 36:45.829
You chose me over a girl at

36:45.830 --> 36:45.990
home?

36:45.991 --> 36:47.989
I left my girlfriend

36:47.990 --> 36:48.700
officially for you.

36:48.701 --> 36:49.989
I thought you guys were,

36:49.990 --> 36:50.990
like, on the rocks?

36:50.990 --> 36:51.990
We were, but I officially...

36:51.991 --> 36:53.989
it would have happened either

36:53.990 --> 36:54.990
way.

36:54.990 --> 36:55.990
I made the decision and did

36:55.991 --> 36:57.289
this and you know what?

36:57.290 --> 36:58.989
Then that's ruining your

36:58.990 --> 36:59.990
life?

36:59.990 --> 36:59.991
Damn.

36:59.991 --> 37:01.989
Are you kidding me right now?

37:01.990 --> 37:02.990
You're really that mad at me

37:02.991 --> 37:04.289
because I won the veto?

37:04.290 --> 37:05.989
No, it's not that!

37:05.990 --> 37:07.989
Then what is it?

37:07.990 --> 37:09.289
I've never lied to you.

37:09.290 --> 37:10.699
Walk away now, please.

37:10.700 --> 37:11.989
I never lied to you.

37:11.990 --> 37:12.990
I was willing to sacrifice my

37:12.990 --> 37:13.990
game for you.

37:13.990 --> 37:14.990
I tell you, I love you with all

37:14.991 --> 37:16.119
my heart and if you don't

37:16.120 --> 37:17.539
believe all the moments that

37:17.540 --> 37:19.989
we've had are real, I don't know

37:19.990 --> 37:27.990
what to say.

37:28.990 --> 37:36.990
Oh, my God.

37:39.990 --> 37:41.989
Are you going to wear the

37:41.990 --> 37:42.700
veto all day?

37:42.701 --> 37:44.989
I always promised I would

37:44.990 --> 37:46.289
cothat so everyone could know

37:46.290 --> 37:46.990
who run.

37:46.991 --> 37:48.989
Or are you just rubbing it

37:48.990 --> 37:50.989
in?

37:50.990 --> 37:52.989
I just walked by him like, "are

37:52.990 --> 37:55.989
you going to wear that veto all

37:55.990 --> 37:56.950
day?"

37:56.951 --> 37:59.989
Like, you can take it off now,

37:59.990 --> 38:02.989
and I whispered, "or are you

38:02.990 --> 38:04.989
just trying to rub it in."

38:04.990 --> 38:06.999
I'm sick of stepping on this

38:07.000 --> 38:07.990
( bleep ).

38:07.990 --> 38:08.990
So I'm going to move it over

38:08.991 --> 38:16.989
here.

38:16.990 --> 38:22.119
I'm Judas.

38:22.120 --> 38:23.989
I hate him.

38:23.990 --> 38:25.409
Oh, I needed that.

38:25.410 --> 38:26.410
It's disgusting.

38:26.410 --> 38:27.120
I know.

38:27.121 --> 38:29.989
It's so ugly.

38:29.990 --> 38:30.700
Yuck.

38:30.700 --> 38:30.990
What?

38:30.990 --> 38:31.990
He's ugly.

38:31.991 --> 38:33.119
You're not that cute.

38:33.120 --> 38:35.989
You're not that cute.

38:35.990 --> 38:37.989
Without the ponytail beard,

38:37.990 --> 38:38.990
he's kind of cute.

38:38.991 --> 38:40.830
Ew.

39:03.990 --> 39:06.289
This game has really gotten

39:06.290 --> 39:07.989
it's been an extremely tough

39:07.990 --> 39:08.990
week, but I care about the kid

39:08.991 --> 39:11.949
so much, and I hope that we can

39:11.950 --> 39:19.950
salvage our relationship.

40:26.990 --> 40:28.699
Hey, everybody.

40:28.700 --> 40:36.700
It's time for the veto meeting.

40:40.830 --> 40:43.949
This is the veto meeting.

40:43.950 --> 40:45.989
Liz and I have been nominated

40:45.990 --> 40:45.991
for eviction.

40:45.991 --> 40:47.989
But I have the power to veto one

40:47.990 --> 40:53.989
of those nominations.

40:53.990 --> 40:55.989
Liz, while my heart tells me use

40:55.990 --> 40:57.989
this veto to save Liz, my head

40:57.990 --> 40:58.990
is telling me, if I do that,

40:58.991 --> 41:00.989
then I might not be here to

41:00.990 --> 41:02.539
fight for her anymore.

41:02.540 --> 41:03.989
After thinking about everything,

41:03.990 --> 41:06.989
I have decided to use the power

41:06.990 --> 41:11.539
of veto to save myself.

41:11.540 --> 41:12.989
Steve, since I have just vetoed

41:12.990 --> 41:14.989
one of your nominations for

41:14.990 --> 41:16.949
eviction, ul have to name a new

41:16.950 --> 41:17.989
houseguest as a replacement

41:17.990 --> 41:25.119
nominee.

41:25.120 --> 41:28.989
I just... I hate being the bad

41:28.990 --> 41:32.989
guy here.

41:32.990 --> 41:40.990
Julia, I'm so sorry.

41:45.990 --> 41:47.699
This veto meeting is

41:47.700 --> 41:54.949
adjourned.

41:54.950 --> 41:55.999
It is really hard being up

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
next to my sister.

41:57.001 --> 41:58.989
I think she deserves it more.

41:58.990 --> 42:00.949
I would sacrifice myself to make

42:00.950 --> 42:07.289
sure that she stays.

42:07.290 --> 42:08.989
Austin was my original

42:08.990 --> 42:09.990
target, but breaking up the

42:09.991 --> 42:11.949
twins is not a bad thing because

42:11.950 --> 42:12.989
they're a huge target.

42:12.990 --> 42:15.989
Been, Liz and Julia, nice to

42:15.990 --> 42:16.990
know you.

42:16.991 --> 42:18.989
Twin twist is over.

42:18.990 --> 42:19.990
Sayonara, see you in jury.

42:19.991 --> 42:21.989
This was a really tough day.

42:21.990 --> 42:23.989
I had to take myself off the

42:23.990 --> 42:24.990
block and watch my girlfriend

42:24.990 --> 42:25.990
stay up there.

42:25.990 --> 42:26.990
It's brutal.

42:26.990 --> 42:27.990
I failed.

42:27.990 --> 42:28.990
I couldn't save the twins.

42:28.990 --> 42:29.990
And I never wanted this to

42:29.990 --> 42:30.990
happen.

42:30.991 --> 42:32.989
We came in this game as Liz,

42:32.990 --> 42:35.989
she had to sacrifice her own

42:35.990 --> 42:37.989
identity for me, so I feel like

42:37.990 --> 42:38.990
at this point it's maybe, like,

42:38.991 --> 42:40.989
the least that I can do, you

42:40.990 --> 42:43.989
know, to... to give her a chance,

42:43.990 --> 42:44.990
an opportunity.

42:44.991 --> 42:49.989
But I want to stay here a lot.

42:49.990 --> 42:50.990
Who will be evicted from the

42:50.991 --> 42:53.989
"Big Brother" house, Liz or

42:53.990 --> 42:54.290
Julia?

42:54.291 --> 42:55.989
And the power is up for grabs in

42:55.990 --> 42:57.829
an all-nigh battle for head of

42:57.830 --> 42:58.989
household.

42:58.990 --> 43:04.989
It all happens live tomorrow at

43:04.990 --> 43:06.989
9:00, 8:00 central on "big

43:06.990 --> 43:07.990
brother."
