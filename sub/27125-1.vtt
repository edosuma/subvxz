- Lot of work?
- No, today is fine.

00:44.151 --> 00:46.854
Yes, it is.

00:48.742 --> 00:50.150
Are you going to the hotel?

00:50.514 --> 00:54.448
I will finish here and go later.

00:55.745 --> 00:59.439
I'm going to the hotel now.
Are you busy?

00:59.782 --> 01:01.845
I'm not that busy.

01:02.514 --> 01:04.461
So, shall we go together?

01:05.044 --> 01:08.756
No problem.
I can come back later.

01:09.345 --> 01:10.725
Come back later?

01:11.401 --> 01:12.701
Yes.

01:13.013 --> 01:15.673
- Anyways, continue.
- OK.

Manager Jeon!

02:11.204 --> 02:13.880
What are you doing here?
Why didn't you come back?

02:13.981 --> 02:17.470
No, I'm still around.
I wanted to enjoy it.

02:18.671 --> 02:22.682
But why stay here?
Did you stay here all the time?

02:23.007 --> 02:24.307
Yes, I did.

02:26.084 --> 02:29.896
It's been very hard for us without you!

02:29.997 --> 02:31.297
Oh really?

02:31.844 --> 02:36.235
Has it been hard for you?
I'm sorry.

02:36.336 --> 02:38.091
But you were the most harmed.

02:38.644 --> 02:40.122
Anyway, what happened?

02:42.976 --> 02:44.934
What can I tell...?

02:46.434 --> 02:49.242
Why did you give up so suddenly?

02:51.425 --> 02:54.941
It was forced, I didn’t want to.

02:55.056 --> 02:58.928
- Who forced it? The boss?
- Yes, she asked me to resign.

02:59.117 --> 03:01.057
Why? For what reason?

03:03.745 --> 03:05.556
Who knows? I'm curious too.

03:07.247 --> 03:09.291
But how could she do that?

03:11.290 --> 03:13.636
You are the treasure of our company.

03:14.619 --> 03:17.876
She always said it about you.

03:19.407 --> 03:22.344
I'm also curious to
know why she fired me.

03:22.877 --> 03:25.864
But what did she say?

03:31.967 --> 03:34.824
Three days ago I was in the cabin,

03:35.511 --> 03:39.599
- we get back to the hotel together.
- I know, I was there, too.

03:41.191 --> 03:44.709
Then she invited me for a coffee.

03:44.810 --> 03:46.461
Invited?

03:48.865 --> 03:52.811
We were drinking coffee and then,
she told me.

03:54.324 --> 03:56.054
That I should resign.

03:59.136 --> 04:00.436
She forced me.

04:00.570 --> 04:04.454
What could I do? I did what I was told.

04:05.062 --> 04:07.230
This is ridiculous.

04:08.354 --> 04:11.137
Why did she ask you to resign?

04:13.585 --> 04:16.947
Don't tell anyone about it.

04:17.290 --> 04:19.224
Of course, I won't.

04:19.456 --> 04:21.918
I need some time to think it over.

04:24.724 --> 04:26.601
That's why I'm still here.

04:26.791 --> 04:28.091
Sure.

04:28.373 --> 04:29.950
It's important.

04:30.847 --> 04:35.131
- It' been five years.
- Yes, it does.

04:35.456 --> 04:37.113
Exactly five years today.

04:53.973 --> 04:56.910
I think you have a good heart, you know?

04:57.468 --> 04:59.556
Thanks.

05:01.290 --> 05:04.091
No need to thank me. It's true.

05:04.336 --> 05:05.636
No...

05:06.065 --> 05:09.094
But you wanted to
talk about something?

05:10.071 --> 05:12.559
Why are so rushed today?

05:13.481 --> 05:16.922
- What you mean?
- Usually you're very calm.

05:19.936 --> 05:23.119
Lost in thought.
With a good heart, like I said.

05:25.142 --> 05:30.756
I'm not sure if I have a good heart.

05:32.834 --> 05:37.962
But having a good heart doesn't
necessarily mean that you are honest.

05:39.001 --> 05:40.301
What?

05:41.776 --> 05:45.384
Do you know what's most important

05:46.188 --> 05:48.522
for me about a co-worker?

05:50.422 --> 05:51.722
I'm not sure.

05:53.548 --> 05:54.848
Honesty.

05:58.102 --> 05:59.734
It's something precious.

06:02.502 --> 06:05.679
A natural born attribute.

06:06.477 --> 06:10.005
It's not something
you can achieve with time.

06:11.505 --> 06:14.805
That's why I hired you, you know that?

06:15.284 --> 06:16.854
I got it.

06:23.561 --> 06:24.861
Still...

06:25.961 --> 06:30.325
Even though I think you have a good
heart, I've come to the conclusion.

06:31.542 --> 06:32.848
of what...

06:33.714 --> 06:38.081
there's no guarantee of your honesty.

06:41.370 --> 06:44.420
Why did you come to this conclusion?

06:44.521 --> 06:48.791
Do you think I'm dishonest?

06:49.062 --> 06:50.362
Yes, a little.

06:50.699 --> 06:53.537
I do, I'm sorry.

06:54.281 --> 06:56.817
- It's the way I see it.
- Alright.

06:57.265 --> 07:00.838
There's nothing I can do about it.

07:00.939 --> 07:04.424
But I don't know why you think it.

07:06.964 --> 07:08.719
It doesn't matter.

07:09.887 --> 07:11.587
It's just the way I see things.

07:12.945 --> 07:16.436
No matter how I came to that conclusion.

07:17.321 --> 07:18.742
You don't need to know.

07:19.087 --> 07:21.574
If you tell me, I can try to fix it.

07:22.631 --> 07:26.214
I always considered myself honest.

07:26.791 --> 07:29.239
As I said,
it's not something you can achieve.

07:32.742 --> 07:34.922
If we lose confidence in someone,

07:35.585 --> 07:39.537
we should no longer
work with that person.

07:40.773 --> 07:42.504
I understand.

07:43.844 --> 07:46.130
So you shouldn't have
made that kind of mistake.

07:48.699 --> 07:52.725
I'm curious about your reasons.

07:53.856 --> 07:58.134
I finally decided to
support my conclusion.

08:01.567 --> 08:02.867
Now...

08:04.531 --> 08:06.374
comes the hardest part.

08:10.274 --> 08:13.814
Let's stop working together.

08:16.391 --> 08:17.691
Oh, really?

08:18.539 --> 08:21.137
Yes. I'm serious.

08:25.431 --> 08:26.731
I'm sorry...

08:28.705 --> 08:30.319
To see things this way.

08:37.818 --> 08:42.140
And if you don't mind, let's not
wait until return to Seoul.

08:43.116 --> 08:45.513
Let's finish everything here today.

08:47.185 --> 08:48.682
Today?

08:52.945 --> 08:56.356
This is very shocking.

08:58.527 --> 09:01.667
I'm really intrigued.

09:02.637 --> 09:04.448
Why do you see things like that?

09:05.579 --> 09:08.871
I should give you some time.

09:11.788 --> 09:13.494
But if you do not mind,

09:13.794 --> 09:18.725
I'd rather we go in separate ways now.

09:19.124 --> 09:21.236
For the sake of our team.

09:22.551 --> 09:23.851
Besides that,

09:26.341 --> 09:29.525
working with someone I don't
feel comfortable with...

09:30.705 --> 09:33.851
it's not easy,
so let's avoid this trouble.

09:34.810 --> 09:36.110
Sure.

09:37.441 --> 09:41.866
It can't be helped if
you see things that way.

09:41.967 --> 09:46.534
Although I still don't
understand your reasons.

09:49.339 --> 09:50.922
Trust in my judgment.

09:52.281 --> 09:54.497
It was a tough to decide it.

10:16.164 --> 10:20.559
You're so nice, lying there.

10:26.890 --> 10:29.845
You are very nice.

10:34.681 --> 10:35.981
Manhee?

10:42.613 --> 10:43.913
What about...

10:45.131 --> 10:48.953
we take a picture together?
To register our farewell?

10:49.277 --> 10:50.577
I think...

10:52.065 --> 10:56.257
that would be a good way to
celebrate my resignation.

10:59.622 --> 11:03.008
Do you really need to do this?

11:03.280 --> 11:04.580
Well...

11:04.681 --> 11:08.553
We've been together for a long
time, so I'd like a photo.

11:08.847 --> 11:12.239
- Are you serious?
- Yes. One, two, three!

11:23.844 --> 11:26.842
It hurts me to do that.

11:28.047 --> 11:31.131
I wanted to work with
you for a long time.

11:32.699 --> 11:36.701
Me too, but I guess it won't happen.

11:39.185 --> 11:42.177
We'll meet again someday.

11:43.037 --> 11:44.996
I'm sure we will.

11:52.157 --> 11:54.030
How was it with a young girl?

11:56.231 --> 11:58.350
Sorry to delay your work.

11:59.641 --> 12:02.990
It's not a delay. I can do her job.

12:04.514 --> 12:05.814
I'm sorry.

12:07.511 --> 12:08.811
Gosh.

12:11.924 --> 12:14.541
So you feel sorry?

12:15.117 --> 12:16.596
Of course.

12:18.619 --> 12:21.057
It's so recent.

12:22.841 --> 12:25.205
We should eat before your interviews.

12:27.327 --> 12:28.682
I wish I could not do them.

12:29.093 --> 12:31.242
- How many?
- Two.

12:31.967 --> 12:34.910
You have to, it's not many.

12:35.056 --> 12:36.356
I know.

12:37.253 --> 12:40.756
So, she's back in Seoul?

12:42.274 --> 12:45.747
I don't know, she left the hotel.

12:47.277 --> 12:48.922
Why? Do you miss her?

12:49.136 --> 12:50.436
It's not that.

12:51.382 --> 12:53.747
But she leaving during the festival...

12:55.844 --> 12:57.958
She worked for you for a long time,
right?

12:58.059 --> 12:59.359
Yes.

12:59.924 --> 13:01.987
- About five years?
- Right.

13:02.779 --> 13:05.181
And was she good in her role?

13:05.733 --> 13:07.101
Did she help you a lot?

13:08.828 --> 13:10.214
She was meticulous.

13:10.847 --> 13:13.636
That's why I hired her,
despite her English.

13:13.917 --> 13:16.288
What? Was her English bad?

13:17.770 --> 13:19.470
She has no ear for tongues.

13:20.582 --> 13:21.882
I didn't know it.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.287
She had style though.

13:25.388 --> 13:28.381
It was easy to have her around.
The men liked her.

13:29.105 --> 13:30.713
It was the alcohol.

13:31.474 --> 13:33.901
Without alcohol,
it would never have happened.

13:35.942 --> 13:37.242
I know.

13:37.708 --> 13:40.836
You are not the type to
do this without alcohol.

13:42.207 --> 13:46.313
95% of my life's mistakes
were alcohol driven.

13:53.653 --> 13:59.051
If it happens again,
we will separate for good.

13:59.831 --> 14:02.873
Don't worry, it won't repeat.

14:05.234 --> 14:07.107
Why should I worry?

14:07.948 --> 14:09.741
Yes, you're right.

14:12.767 --> 14:14.067
Look that!

14:14.767 --> 14:16.744
This ship is huge.

14:18.404 --> 14:23.993
You will come here often.
Control yourself.

14:24.902 --> 14:26.202
Yeah.

14:27.618 --> 14:31.060
I'm going to work a lot. Help me.

14:31.161 --> 14:32.491
That's our deal.

14:33.302 --> 14:34.602
Yes.

14:35.111 --> 14:36.565
I'm really going to work.

14:38.281 --> 14:40.842
That's it. I help you.

14:42.841 --> 14:44.141
Come here.

15:51.941 --> 15:54.916
- Hello.
- Hello.

15:56.397 --> 15:59.626
- Are you here to see Director So?
- No, why?

15:59.727 --> 16:03.125
This is his hotel. I'll meet him later.

16:03.868 --> 16:05.747
For what?

16:06.391 --> 16:10.159
To say hello. He was my teacher.

16:11.007 --> 16:12.481
I see.

16:12.582 --> 16:14.214
Yes, he taught class.

16:17.154 --> 16:21.377
But he barely taught and
always drank with his students.

16:21.893 --> 16:23.402
Are you close to him?

16:23.831 --> 16:25.710
Not at all.

16:26.201 --> 16:28.301
I don't even know if he remembers me.

16:29.321 --> 16:30.744
- Is that so?
- Yes.

16:32.324 --> 16:35.330
Mrs. Nam will join us as well.

16:35.431 --> 16:39.016
- Really?
- My short was shown here.

16:39.117 --> 16:41.558
- Right.
- After seeing it, she asked me to

16:41.659 --> 16:44.177
meet with Director So.

16:44.342 --> 16:46.793
She wants to make a movie with you?

16:48.114 --> 16:50.504
I guess not.

16:50.637 --> 16:55.101
I don't think I'm
mature to make a movie.

16:56.164 --> 16:59.076
Maturity has nothing to
do with making movies.

17:00.121 --> 17:01.764
You need honesty.

17:02.053 --> 17:06.023
It's hard to make an honest movie.

17:07.387 --> 17:11.666
You also need to be honest in life.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.656
But this is not easy.

17:15.056 --> 17:19.193
Yes, honesty is important.
Well, I have to go.

17:19.364 --> 17:22.079
- Really?
- We talk later.

17:22.188 --> 17:23.669
- Right.
- Bye.

17:23.770 --> 17:25.069
See you.

17:41.985 --> 17:44.395
- It's my first time at Cannes.
- Is that so?

17:44.496 --> 17:46.350
Yes, I never came. For real.

17:46.451 --> 17:50.063
This is my first time too, I'm very happy

17:50.164 --> 17:52.832
- What's the exhibit hour?
- At 7:00 p.m.

17:52.933 --> 17:54.420
- 7:00?
- The twentieth.

17:54.521 --> 17:55.570
- It's a good time.
- Yes.

17:55.671 --> 17:57.833
- Very well then.
- I'll wait for you.

17:58.004 --> 17:59.304
Right.

18:04.447 --> 18:05.851
Where are you from?

18:07.837 --> 18:09.343
I'm from Korea.

18:09.444 --> 18:12.042
- You're Korean?
- Yeah.

18:12.570 --> 18:13.870
Yes, I'm Korean.

18:14.853 --> 18:17.014
- Where you are from?
- I'm from Paris.

18:17.357 --> 18:19.501
Paris! So...

18:20.447 --> 18:22.067
- You are French?
- Yes.

18:22.841 --> 18:24.811
I just arrived a few hours ago.

18:25.382 --> 18:27.607
My friend is showing her
movie at the festival

18:27.708 --> 18:29.722
- Oh really?
- I came down with her.

18:29.893 --> 18:31.414
Oh, I see.

18:31.967 --> 18:35.076
I'm showing my film here too.
I'm a film director.

18:36.828 --> 18:38.245
You are a film director?

18:43.419 --> 18:46.516
I was right.
I thought you were an artist.

18:46.683 --> 18:47.983
- Oh really?
- Yes.

18:48.084 --> 18:51.457
Thank you!
You look like an artist too.

18:52.471 --> 18:53.810
What do you do for a living?

18:53.911 --> 18:56.504
No, I'm not an artist.
I'm teacher.

18:56.730 --> 18:58.030
A teacher?

19:00.741 --> 19:04.762
But  write poetry sometimes.
Purely for my pleasure.

19:07.191 --> 19:09.821
And I make photos too. With this.

19:11.130 --> 19:16.977
I see... you're a poet.
You're an artist too.

19:17.253 --> 19:19.531
Yes, I guess so.

19:23.991 --> 19:27.039
- Can I sit with you?
- Yes.

19:28.022 --> 19:29.322
Thank you.

19:46.668 --> 19:48.867
What is your name? My name is So.

19:50.139 --> 19:51.507
- So?
- Yes.

19:52.213 --> 19:54.245
- My name is Claire.
-Claire?

19:54.890 --> 19:56.307
What a beautiful name.

19:58.336 --> 20:01.213
- Very happy to meet you.
- Very happy to meet you too.

20:01.314 --> 20:02.614
Yeah.

20:47.901 --> 20:49.487
What's your name, again?

20:49.684 --> 20:51.525
Can I find you on Google?

20:52.065 --> 20:56.017
Oh I think so. It's So Wansoo.

20:58.732 --> 21:00.032
With S.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.042
- S?
- S-O

21:03.081 --> 21:05.248
W-A-N

21:06.133 --> 21:08.807
- Two "U"?
-No, just W.

21:08.908 --> 21:10.393
- W.
- Yeah.

21:11.585 --> 21:15.322
W-A-N-S-O-O.

21:28.902 --> 21:30.731
Yeah, is me.

21:39.807 --> 21:41.107
Is me.

21:42.305 --> 21:45.488
LIBRARY

21:53.234 --> 21:54.534
- Here?
- Yes.

22:16.773 --> 22:18.270
It's a beautiful book.

22:19.265 --> 22:21.359
- Can you read it here?
- Yeah.

22:25.302 --> 22:26.996
"I want to talk about a person.

22:27.764 --> 22:30.147
A man of about 25 at most.

22:31.339 --> 22:32.737
He's a handsome man,

22:33.696 --> 22:37.285
who wants to die before
being marked by death.

22:38.687 --> 22:39.987
You loved him.

22:40.890 --> 22:42.190
More than that."

22:46.256 --> 22:47.913
Beautiful, it's great.

22:49.025 --> 22:51.531
- Your voice is great.
- Oh thank you.

22:51.825 --> 22:53.125
Beautiful.

22:55.117 --> 22:56.633
It's a strange poem.

22:57.622 --> 22:58.922
Strange?

22:59.117 --> 23:01.310
Yes, a little.

23:02.754 --> 23:04.054
But I like it.

23:05.265 --> 23:07.347
I wish I could read French.

23:08.804 --> 23:11.254
It is a very difficult
language to learn.

23:11.364 --> 23:12.664
I see.

23:12.847 --> 23:14.740
But I want to memorize this poem.

23:14.841 --> 23:17.316
Even just one poem, for fun.

23:19.536 --> 23:22.294
- Can you teach me how to pronounce?
- Sure.

23:23.967 --> 23:25.267
Come this way.

23:25.881 --> 23:27.181
Yes.

23:29.228 --> 23:31.544
- So you repeat after me.
- Yes.

23:56.594 --> 23:57.894
- That!
- Yeah.

24:00.367 --> 24:01.667
Very good.

24:18.127 --> 24:19.427
No, it's...

24:19.686 --> 24:20.986
Yeah.

24:21.087 --> 24:24.518
It's a "P".
You're saying like an "F", it's a "P".

24:24.619 --> 24:25.919
"P", yeah.

24:37.401 --> 24:39.057
- Very good.
- Right.

24:46.754 --> 24:48.516
How beautiful!

24:51.062 --> 24:52.688
What a beautiful dog!

24:54.877 --> 24:56.590
Are you resting?

24:59.068 --> 25:01.771
- It's beautiful, right?
- Yes, beautiful.

25:03.382 --> 25:04.682
You're beautiful.

25:07.437 --> 25:08.737
Bye bye.

25:10.213 --> 25:11.513
See you!

25:13.991 --> 25:15.291
Bye.

25:27.536 --> 25:29.220
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

25:29.321 --> 25:32.100
It's only a photo.
You don't have to thank me.

25:32.201 --> 25:33.501
I know.

25:33.634 --> 25:35.907
- But I want to thank you.
- Why?

25:36.687 --> 25:39.755
Because taking a photo is
something very important.

25:39.856 --> 25:41.482
Oh, I see.

25:41.887 --> 25:46.054
- Why is it very important?
- Because if I take a photo of you,

25:46.477 --> 25:48.319
you're not the same person anymore.

25:48.564 --> 25:50.030
- Oh really?
- Yes.

25:50.241 --> 25:52.805
- What do you mean?
- I don't mean anything.

25:53.081 --> 25:55.107
It's just how I feel about it.

25:55.723 --> 25:57.023
Interesting.

25:57.124 --> 26:00.020
So I am a different person now?

26:00.121 --> 26:01.421
Yes.

26:02.161 --> 26:04.497
- I think so.
- Okay.

26:05.197 --> 26:07.937
Let me see this picture.

26:11.881 --> 26:15.217
What's the difference between
this picture and myself?

26:15.382 --> 26:17.334
Well, I know it's just a photo.

26:19.241 --> 26:21.328
But you've actually changed now.

26:24.221 --> 26:25.925
And I can feel it.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.500
- Really?
- Yes.

26:28.601 --> 26:29.931
I don't buy it.

26:30.681 --> 26:32.651
I'm a very sensitive person.

26:36.021 --> 26:37.321
But...

26:38.034 --> 26:39.556
Can you look at me now?

26:41.138 --> 26:42.438
My eyes.

26:42.539 --> 26:44.536
- Your eyes?
- Yes, please.

26:44.637 --> 26:45.937
Okay.

26:57.221 --> 26:58.817
Am I the same person?

27:00.061 --> 27:03.525
Am I the same person you
saw a few hours ago?

27:09.056 --> 27:11.273
Can't you see the differences?

27:15.290 --> 27:16.590
No.

27:17.917 --> 27:19.267
It's funny.

27:20.170 --> 27:21.470
What is this?

27:22.490 --> 27:25.706
Why I feel this way?
It's just strange.

27:25.807 --> 27:29.525
It's because I took your
picture some few minutes ago.

27:29.971 --> 27:31.743
Why don't you take a picture of me?

27:31.844 --> 27:34.651
- I want to see that you're not joking.
- Okay.

27:46.957 --> 27:48.420
- Can I see?
- Sure.

27:48.521 --> 27:49.589
- It's yours.
- Thank you.

27:49.690 --> 27:51.515
Let me look at your eyes again.

27:51.616 --> 27:53.359
- Yes, if you want.
- Hm.

28:10.041 --> 28:11.341
This is funny.

28:13.751 --> 28:15.061
Does it look different?

28:17.990 --> 28:19.290
You want to look at them?

28:19.391 --> 28:22.245
- I took these pictures this morning.
- Oh thank you.

28:25.200 --> 28:26.500
It's a good picture.

28:26.601 --> 28:28.161
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

28:33.259 --> 28:34.559
Why is she here?

28:37.204 --> 28:38.504
Do you know her?

28:39.259 --> 28:40.559
Yes, I know her.

28:40.988 --> 28:44.436
She's Korean. She's... Manhee.

28:47.967 --> 28:50.500
- When did you take this picture?
- This morning.

28:50.601 --> 28:54.288
When I arrived.
I was on the roof of a big hotel.

28:54.828 --> 28:56.270
She was so pretty.

28:56.681 --> 28:59.162
I asked if I could
take her picture.

28:59.481 --> 29:00.781
Oh, really?

29:01.721 --> 29:03.021
But...

29:03.837 --> 29:05.790
What she was doing here?

29:06.582 --> 29:10.405
She's not supposed to be here.
And all this makeup...

29:11.360 --> 29:12.660
I don't know exactly.

29:12.761 --> 29:15.661
She was very busy talking with people.

29:15.926 --> 29:17.226
How can I say?

29:17.327 --> 29:22.121
She was a very popular girl there.

29:23.031 --> 29:24.331
Look at this.

29:25.745 --> 29:27.201
I've never seen her like this.

29:27.302 --> 29:30.325
Why is she wearing
so much makeup?

29:31.144 --> 29:32.444
You're right.

29:32.545 --> 29:33.845
You know her too?

29:34.404 --> 29:36.836
Yes, she was my employee.

29:37.610 --> 29:39.704
- Oh, I see.
- Yes.

29:44.221 --> 29:45.521
May I?

29:45.622 --> 29:47.827
- Yes.
- Thank you.

30:42.801 --> 30:45.297
I'm sorry. Is it okay?

30:45.425 --> 30:47.987
- It's okay, I don't mind.
- Oh, thank you.

30:48.861 --> 30:50.161
You look like an artist.

30:50.262 --> 30:51.661
- Do I?
- Yes!

30:53.327 --> 30:55.306
I've been watching
you for a long time.

30:55.407 --> 30:57.457
- Really?
- It made me feel good.

30:58.379 --> 31:00.134
I'm happy to hear that.

31:01.597 --> 31:04.897
- Are you an artist?
- No, I'm not an artist.

31:05.161 --> 31:07.765
- I wish I was.
- Oh, that's bad.

31:08.213 --> 31:10.288
But you're feeling better.
So that's good!

31:10.441 --> 31:11.827
Yes, you're right.

31:14.804 --> 31:16.104
You're so pretty.

31:16.646 --> 31:17.946
I know that?

31:18.047 --> 31:19.466
- Am I?
- Yeah!

31:19.567 --> 31:21.829
Thank you but, you're beautiful too.

31:21.930 --> 31:24.565
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.

31:27.179 --> 31:30.411
So you came here alone? Yes, I'm alone...

31:30.533 --> 31:32.657
and nobody to talk to.

31:34.459 --> 31:37.513
- If you want, you can talk to me.
- Thank you.

31:37.924 --> 31:40.073
We need someone to talk to.

31:42.570 --> 31:46.079
- What do you do for a living?
- I'm teacher.

31:47.234 --> 31:50.473
I'm a film selling person.

31:51.794 --> 31:55.051
- You sell films?
- Yes, I sell films.

31:55.801 --> 31:57.919
But selling is no fun.

31:58.391 --> 32:00.682
- If you know what I mean.
- I know.

32:01.044 --> 32:03.687
Selling is no fun. Nothing fun at all.

32:03.788 --> 32:07.765
Any selling is no fun.
We shouldn't sell anything.

32:07.967 --> 32:11.193
I agree, no selling of any sorts.

32:11.548 --> 32:15.076
I'm happy we agreed. Agree is great.

32:15.333 --> 32:17.857
I agree 100%.

32:21.173 --> 32:23.796
- So are you French?
- Yes.

32:24.502 --> 32:27.220
- I'm from Paris.
- Ah, you're from Paris...

32:27.321 --> 32:29.242
So which part of Paris?

32:29.554 --> 32:34.540
I live in the 14th arrondissement.
Are you familiar with Paris?

32:34.641 --> 32:38.153
No. I've been there for a long time ago.

32:38.773 --> 32:40.381
Only two times.

32:41.524 --> 32:42.861
Two times...

32:44.619 --> 32:47.734
- Where you are from?
- I'm from Korea.

32:51.284 --> 32:54.756
What are the 3 things
you like most in Korea?

32:57.942 --> 32:59.242
I like food,

33:00.081 --> 33:05.156
I like my memories there,
and I like my friends.

33:07.708 --> 33:09.833
I've never had Korean food before.

33:10.656 --> 33:11.956
I know about Kimchi,

33:12.059 --> 33:15.958
but I have never really had
really Korean food.

33:16.059 --> 33:17.359
That's bad.

33:18.116 --> 33:19.416
But it's ok.

33:19.517 --> 33:21.814
You can have it now if you want.

33:22.410 --> 33:24.555
Do you have a Korean restaurant here?

33:24.656 --> 33:26.838
No, they don't have it here.

33:26.939 --> 33:30.424
But in our apartment I used to stay.

33:30.761 --> 33:32.967
There's a lot of Korean food.

33:33.068 --> 33:36.288
I can make one Korean dish for you,
you might like.

33:36.557 --> 33:37.857
Really?

33:38.693 --> 33:40.639
Could you really do that for me?

33:43.284 --> 33:45.507
I will be happy to cook for you.

33:47.037 --> 33:50.565
- What's your name, anyway?
- My name is Claire.

33:51.370 --> 33:53.670
- And what's yours?
- Manhee.

33:53.771 --> 33:56.639
Manhee.

33:58.194 --> 34:01.784
- You want to go now? For that cooking?
- Yes why not? Let's go.

34:05.597 --> 34:08.074
Wow! This is great.

34:08.176 --> 34:09.697
- Nice?
- Yeah.

34:10.181 --> 34:11.521
What do you do for a living?

34:11.621 --> 34:14.475
Ah yes, you told me.
You're a teacher.

34:14.576 --> 34:17.704
I'm a poet too.
And I take photos too, with this.

34:18.011 --> 34:21.367
- Oh, it's great.
- Yes, it's great.

34:21.467 --> 34:25.205
You can write poems anytime
you want, it's not that difficult.

34:25.733 --> 34:30.277
I sometimes make songs,
they're very childish songs.

34:30.379 --> 34:33.007
But they make me feel good.

34:34.090 --> 34:37.833
So you're a composer.
You are an artist too.

34:38.440 --> 34:41.648
- Do you want to hear my song?
- Sure, I'd love to.

34:42.244 --> 34:44.030
Okay, so...

34:45.702 --> 34:50.601
One, two, two, three, three

34:50.705 --> 34:55.235
Four, four, five...

34:55.382 --> 34:59.599
Six, six, seven, seven...

34:59.874 --> 35:03.896
Eight, eight, eight, ten...

35:03.997 --> 35:07.845
All the numbers are important

35:08.139 --> 35:12.147
We count everything with numbers

35:12.631 --> 35:16.971
We do not know, we do not know

35:17.099 --> 35:21.349
Only we count in numbers

35:21.450 --> 35:22.672
It's wonderful!

35:22.773 --> 35:24.444
Thank you! Easy song.

35:24.545 --> 35:27.453
Oh, it's great, you have a beautiful voice.

35:27.554 --> 35:29.704
Thank you. Thank you very much!

35:34.141 --> 35:36.264
The gala exhibition is tomorrow.

35:36.471 --> 35:39.232
With your health,
you should not strain yourself.

35:39.333 --> 35:41.983
I feel frustrated.

35:42.084 --> 35:44.054
How can I say? I'm against the wall.

35:44.908 --> 35:48.054
Too many worries, I guess.

35:48.241 --> 35:50.413
What are you worried about?

35:50.514 --> 35:51.786
- It's just...
- Tell me.

35:51.887 --> 35:54.321
It's just... Nothing special.

35:55.259 --> 35:57.242
At these times, I like to drink.

35:58.791 --> 36:00.676
Do you want to get drunk?

36:01.290 --> 36:03.537
Why drink so fast?

36:03.831 --> 36:06.959
I'm already drunk. I drank a lot!

36:11.425 --> 36:12.725
Wait...

36:13.554 --> 36:15.519
Are you thinking about Manhee?

36:16.001 --> 36:18.516
- Is that?
- Manhee?

36:20.317 --> 36:21.617
Manhee.

36:22.182 --> 36:24.473
I'm worried it was my mistake.

36:25.967 --> 36:27.777
What is the problem?

36:28.717 --> 36:32.075
You slept with her
while you were drunk.

36:32.176 --> 36:33.716
And she wanted too.

36:34.588 --> 36:38.079
I just feel sorry.
Something is wrong with me.

36:39.074 --> 36:40.374
I feel like this.

36:41.339 --> 36:45.027
Or maybe you miss her.

36:49.881 --> 36:51.482
I don't think so.

36:52.367 --> 36:56.116
Anyway, something is
definitely wrong with me.

36:59.154 --> 37:02.017
- You're pathetic.
- What?

37:04.871 --> 37:06.171
What did you say?

37:07.548 --> 37:09.117
That you're pathetic.

37:10.927 --> 37:16.639
You get drunk, sleep with a girl.
Why are you so worried?

37:22.311 --> 37:25.304
Sorry to say that,

37:26.410 --> 37:27.710
but I have to...

37:29.296 --> 37:31.094
I wish I had said it before.

37:32.773 --> 37:34.073
What?

37:36.570 --> 37:42.294
You and I have a good
working relationship,

37:42.797 --> 37:46.534
and we respect each other.

37:47.308 --> 37:51.833
But I don't think we
should be a couple anymore.

37:52.705 --> 37:56.990
So we can work together
for a long time.

38:04.096 --> 38:05.396
Are you serious?

38:06.305 --> 38:08.848
Yes, I think so.

38:16.188 --> 38:20.405
I think I let you drink too much.

38:20.601 --> 38:21.901
It's not that.

38:22.176 --> 38:25.814
That way we can stay together
for a long time.

38:30.096 --> 38:31.515
What is the real reason?

38:31.616 --> 38:34.210
- That's what I said.
- What are you saying?

38:34.311 --> 38:38.614
For our sake,
while my mind is still sane.

38:40.613 --> 38:41.913
Now...

38:43.277 --> 38:45.408
We need to stop this now.

38:46.061 --> 38:49.427
While you're still beautiful

38:50.441 --> 38:52.005
and to avoid any troubles.

39:05.265 --> 39:06.565
Right.

39:09.628 --> 39:13.919
If that's the way you see it,
go for it.

39:16.970 --> 39:18.270
Thank you.

39:20.102 --> 39:23.693
Don't get me wrong.
Trust in my judgment.

39:23.794 --> 39:25.390
You didn't convince me.

39:26.791 --> 39:28.091
Even so...

39:30.213 --> 39:31.747
if that's the way you see it.

39:33.542 --> 39:38.651
Right or wrong, you see things that way.

39:39.524 --> 39:40.879
I will respect that.

39:42.477 --> 39:43.777
Thank you.

39:44.705 --> 39:46.184
I like you very much.

39:48.053 --> 39:49.482
You are remarkable.

39:57.665 --> 39:59.291
They broke up with me again.

40:05.868 --> 40:08.657
I'm embarrassed.
I immersed myself in this relationship.

40:09.665 --> 40:11.014
What a waste of time.

40:13.081 --> 40:18.054
It's the only way we can
continue with comfort.

40:18.361 --> 40:23.023
It's to last a long time.

40:23.124 --> 40:24.799
Think this way.

40:31.979 --> 40:36.362
I need to think over
about the 'long time'.

40:43.364 --> 40:45.457
Your eyes are very pretty.

40:48.416 --> 40:51.962
Seeing you like this, they really are.

40:57.573 --> 40:58.873
I know.

41:01.708 --> 41:05.527
To be honest, I'm still pretty.

41:05.628 --> 41:08.097
Yes you are.

41:11.727 --> 41:14.221
Can't you like me as before?

41:14.779 --> 41:18.504
When we met, you adored me.

41:19.388 --> 41:21.679
Can't we go back to that time?

41:22.687 --> 41:24.264
Director So!

41:24.921 --> 41:26.694
I’m Yanghye.

41:27.241 --> 41:29.921
Your lovely Yanghye.

41:30.022 --> 41:31.685
I know.

41:32.301 --> 41:36.910
When we first met in Busan,
you were so beautiful.

41:37.011 --> 41:40.733
That's true. I was pretty back then.

41:40.834 --> 41:42.251
Right.

41:42.521 --> 41:44.122
You still are.

41:44.268 --> 41:46.039
- Oh really?
- You are beautiful!

41:51.210 --> 41:53.312
So you're still here. I'm so lucky.

41:53.413 --> 41:56.389
- Ah, you came back!
- Yes.

41:56.490 --> 41:59.254
I left my coat here. I'm so stupid.

41:59.376 --> 42:01.860
- We were expecting you.
- Oh really?

42:01.961 --> 42:03.757
- Thank you.
- Here's your coat.

42:05.185 --> 42:07.261
You drank a lot, So.

42:07.985 --> 42:09.488
You look like a drunk!

42:09.881 --> 42:14.177
Yes, I'm drunk. I want to get drunk.

42:14.705 --> 42:16.177
You want to get drunk?

42:16.410 --> 42:20.984
You know? I'm fifty. I need to get drunk.

42:21.930 --> 42:25.021
- So, you're fifty.
- Fifty.

42:25.394 --> 42:27.550
Yeah, I'm 50 now.

42:29.388 --> 42:31.661
Good. I need to go.

42:32.305 --> 42:34.161
And take good care of yourself.

42:34.262 --> 42:36.768
- You have to go?
- Yes.

42:37.901 --> 42:40.196
- Bye, bye.
- Bye, Claire.

42:49.302 --> 42:51.562
- Here, your sunglasses.
- Oh, thank you.

42:52.341 --> 42:54.973
- It's a nice day.
- Yeah, it's a beautiful day.

42:55.074 --> 42:56.374
Yes.

43:00.711 --> 43:02.149
- I'm hungry.
- Are you hungry?

43:02.250 --> 43:03.176
Yes.

43:03.277 --> 43:04.696
- Don't worry, Claire.
- Come with me.

43:04.797 --> 43:07.137
- I'll cook for you.
- Oh, thank you.

43:11.431 --> 43:14.153
Hey. Excuse me. Thanks.

43:42.793 --> 43:45.806
Sorry, we cannot use the elevator.

43:45.907 --> 43:47.422
It’s out of order.

43:47.537 --> 43:49.273
It looks okay to me.

43:49.593 --> 43:53.908
It looks okay now,
but it sometimes stops in the middle.

43:54.128 --> 43:58.003
A few days ago,
I was stuck there in the elevator.

43:58.104 --> 43:59.404
Really?

43:59.821 --> 44:03.274
- It must have been frightening.
- Yes, I was so scared.

44:03.617 --> 44:05.416
I'm scared of elevators too.

44:06.001 --> 44:12.056
- You mean, even when they work properly?
- Actually, I hate elevators.

44:13.248 --> 44:15.849
Yes, I see. So let's go walking.

44:15.950 --> 44:17.453
Sure. It's okay.

44:20.602 --> 44:22.136
I like this painting.

44:23.624 --> 44:24.924
They look alright.

44:25.747 --> 44:29.311
- But they're kind of strange, too.
- Oh, you think so?

44:29.784 --> 44:31.084
They are strange.

44:32.079 --> 44:33.379
Don't you think?

44:37.174 --> 44:40.339
Yes, they're strange looking at it now.

44:41.638 --> 44:42.938
Yes.

44:43.039 --> 44:46.333
- Very strange.
- Yes, very strange.

45:04.151 --> 45:06.333
- Eat some fruit.
- Thanks.

45:06.516 --> 45:08.105
It was a great meal.

45:09.174 --> 45:11.270
I should have cooked, not you.

45:11.371 --> 45:13.962
It's all right. We needed to eat anyway.

45:14.221 --> 45:16.542
Luckily we had a bit of bulgogi.

45:17.119 --> 45:19.596
I thought it would be hard, but it is not.

45:19.697 --> 45:23.871
We buy in the market.
It's better than the supermarket.

45:25.217 --> 45:27.736
It was great. You're a good cook.

45:28.104 --> 45:30.230
Thank you, I enjoy cooking.

45:30.331 --> 45:32.253
Yes, I can see that.

45:34.257 --> 45:36.864
- Can I take a picture of you?
- Me?

45:36.965 --> 45:39.244
Yes! I like your face.

45:40.054 --> 45:42.991
You have a very feminine face.

45:45.501 --> 45:46.801
You're right.

45:47.193 --> 45:49.644
He has a cute face, like a woman's.

45:50.910 --> 45:53.467
And he has a woman's heart too.

45:53.568 --> 45:55.108
You think so?

45:55.913 --> 45:57.305
He has that quality.

45:58.239 --> 45:59.982
- Can I?
- Sure!

46:16.621 --> 46:19.609
- Can I see?
- Sure. You can have it if you want.

46:19.710 --> 46:21.471
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

46:29.119 --> 46:31.530
- Do you want to look at them?
- Oh, thank you.

46:36.601 --> 46:40.111
- This one is good, beautiful!
- Oh really?

46:40.590 --> 46:44.339
- I'm happy you like it.
- Yes, this one is very beautiful.

46:46.091 --> 46:49.441
- You have great talent.
- Oh, thank you very much.

46:54.984 --> 46:56.284
What is it?

46:57.901 --> 46:59.933
Why is he here? Do you know him?

47:00.202 --> 47:02.271
Oh, So? Yes, I know him.

47:04.781 --> 47:08.234
- He's kind of a drunkard.
- Yes, you're right.

47:08.411 --> 47:10.074
But how do you know him?

47:10.202 --> 47:12.585
I met him accidentally in a café.

47:14.541 --> 47:15.841
So you know him?

47:16.276 --> 47:17.750
- Yes.
- He's a film director.

47:17.851 --> 47:19.151
Yes, he is.

47:23.297 --> 47:24.696
You met him by chance?

47:26.344 --> 47:28.093
I think he's a real drunkard.

47:28.793 --> 47:30.883
Probably now he's totally drunk.

47:30.984 --> 47:32.794
Yes, he likes drinking.

47:35.217 --> 47:37.404
It's so funny you met him.

47:37.808 --> 47:39.761
In fact, we know him very well.

47:40.011 --> 47:41.994
Look, it's Director So.

47:44.270 --> 47:45.939
It's really him.

47:46.873 --> 47:48.253
How funny.

47:49.334 --> 47:51.047
How did she get it?

47:52.971 --> 47:54.399
It looks like an old photo.

47:59.654 --> 48:02.490
There was a Korean woman.
And she was in love with him.

48:02.591 --> 48:03.700
Really?

48:03.801 --> 48:07.379
I took her picture too.
But she wanted to have it.

48:08.061 --> 48:09.361
Who was she?

48:09.937 --> 48:13.369
She said she was kind of producer.
I didn't get it properly.

48:13.470 --> 48:16.241
She was speaking with
strong English accent.

48:18.073 --> 48:19.373
Was she good looing?

48:20.553 --> 48:22.136
She was alright.

48:23.974 --> 48:25.754
But a little strange, too.

48:27.205 --> 48:28.505
I see.

48:28.793 --> 48:30.179
She was strange?

48:36.793 --> 48:38.093
What are you thinking?

48:40.067 --> 48:41.865
I think she was my boss.

48:43.125 --> 48:45.668
She's the one who dismissed me.

48:47.107 --> 48:48.745
Oh, I didn't know that.

48:49.642 --> 48:51.699
She's the one who fired you?

48:51.950 --> 48:54.542
Yes, she did.

48:55.082 --> 48:58.321
- Even without telling me why.
- Really?

48:58.836 --> 49:00.136
Can they do that?

49:00.721 --> 49:02.431
Yes, they can do that.

49:02.996 --> 49:08.111
She told some very strange
reason to dismiss me.

49:09.457 --> 49:10.757
What's it?

49:13.777 --> 49:17.681
She told me she found out
I'm a dishonest person.

49:19.605 --> 49:22.944
But she didn't tell me why

49:23.045 --> 49:26.007
she thinks I'm dishonest person.

49:27.784 --> 49:30.074
Is she an honest person herself?

49:34.817 --> 49:36.204
I don't think so.

49:43.433 --> 49:46.095
I wonder what she was
thinking when she dismissed you.

49:46.196 --> 49:48.099
You're such a nice girl!

49:49.070 --> 49:51.225
I think I know why now.

49:54.701 --> 49:56.001
Do you?

49:56.701 --> 49:59.213
- What is it?
- I think...

50:02.313 --> 50:03.988
I better tell you later.

50:05.857 --> 50:07.699
She was just jealous.

50:08.048 --> 50:09.348
Yeah?

50:11.513 --> 50:13.841
- She was jealous?
- Yes.

50:16.387 --> 50:17.785
Excuse.

51:22.553 --> 51:25.434
- You want another more?
- Yes, thank you.

51:25.617 --> 51:29.436
The same, please.

51:29.537 --> 51:31.137
- Thank you.
- No problem.

51:42.251 --> 51:44.788
- Manhee, it's you.
- Director?

51:45.261 --> 51:48.304
- Nice to see you.
- So are you still here?

51:48.405 --> 51:50.450
I was going to catch a flight back,

51:50.682 --> 51:53.664
but I couldn't change my ticket.

51:53.765 --> 51:57.129
So I thought I'd stick around.

51:57.230 --> 51:59.324
I heard you got fired.

52:02.381 --> 52:04.868
Funny, right?

52:05.870 --> 52:09.166
Aren't you cold? The wind is strong.

52:09.267 --> 52:12.273
I'm not cold.

52:12.374 --> 52:15.391
It's windy today. You look cold.

52:15.771 --> 52:17.213
I am fine.

52:19.476 --> 52:20.776
Your makeup...

52:22.128 --> 52:23.730
is so strong.

52:25.051 --> 52:28.647
That?
I just put in a little bit more.

52:29.919 --> 52:31.219
That's it?

52:33.568 --> 52:35.855
I was very surprised to see you here.

52:35.956 --> 52:37.644
You're in a suit.

52:37.831 --> 52:42.031
- You are handsome!
- It's just something to cover me.

52:42.159 --> 52:45.016
I must use it, it's not mine.

52:45.242 --> 52:46.776
I borrowed.

52:48.079 --> 52:49.933
Still, it's beautiful.

52:52.091 --> 52:56.647
When you decided to wear this skirt,

52:56.990 --> 52:59.061
what were you thinking?

52:59.162 --> 53:02.593
It's a shorts with high waist,
not a skirt.

53:02.694 --> 53:04.911
I know. It's too short.

53:06.817 --> 53:09.724
I thought it was pretty.

53:11.131 --> 53:13.939
I bought it in Seoul.

53:14.311 --> 53:18.080
- Do you want men staring at you?
- What?

53:18.181 --> 53:22.920
You want that kind of cheap
attention from men?

53:23.021 --> 53:23.966
No!

53:24.067 --> 53:26.942
So why turn yourself into a show?

53:27.691 --> 53:30.420
If you were 18,

53:30.521 --> 53:34.612
wanting to try and copy everything,
I would even understand.

53:34.713 --> 53:36.126
But how old are you?

53:36.227 --> 53:40.302
Why to become an object
of cheap attention?

53:40.639 --> 53:42.425
What do you get out of it?

53:42.768 --> 53:46.794
Do you earn something worthwhile?

53:46.971 --> 53:51.145
Even a decent thing?

53:51.371 --> 53:53.910
- No.
- I'm a man, I get that!

53:54.011 --> 53:57.361
Why turn yourself into a cheap show?

53:58.621 --> 54:00.901
You are beautiful!
With a beautiful soul.

54:01.002 --> 54:03.305
You do not need to be exposed like that.

54:03.784 --> 54:06.803
Why to hurt yourself like that?

54:06.904 --> 54:09.553
Are you proud when you
look in the mirror?

54:09.654 --> 54:10.954
No!

54:11.987 --> 54:13.305
Don't do it.

54:14.141 --> 54:15.441
You are so beautiful!

54:16.553 --> 54:20.844
You have a beautiful soul.

54:21.341 --> 54:27.135
It doesn't matter how people see it.

54:27.236 --> 54:28.476
Be yourself.

54:28.577 --> 54:32.064
Don't try to seduce
people or sell yourself!

54:32.165 --> 54:33.465
Got it?

54:35.297 --> 54:36.597
Yes.

54:41.501 --> 54:43.496
You never did that?

54:45.021 --> 54:46.321
What?

54:49.217 --> 54:50.517
I'm a man.

54:52.836 --> 54:54.136
Well...

54:58.737 --> 55:03.077
Why don't you leave?
Don't stay here with me.

55:05.876 --> 55:09.102
- Should I?
- Yes, go away.

55:09.968 --> 55:11.527
Don't stay here with me.

55:13.911 --> 55:17.736
- I'm with someone else now.
- Oh really?

55:18.817 --> 55:20.117
Then I'm leaving.

55:22.165 --> 55:23.804
You look cold!

55:25.242 --> 55:26.542
Goodbye.

55:40.787 --> 55:43.084
- We gotta go.
- Right.

55:58.645 --> 55:59.945
I'm sorry.

56:01.254 --> 56:02.554
I'm sorry.

56:04.664 --> 56:06.634
Don't take pictures!

56:34.516 --> 56:37.380
- So this is the café?
- Yes, this is café.

56:37.481 --> 56:41.077
- And where did you sit?
- We sat at this table.

56:42.116 --> 56:44.087
And there were other people here?

56:44.504 --> 56:46.419
No, I don't think so.

56:46.854 --> 56:49.135
It was a very windy day.

56:49.236 --> 56:51.566
So people didn't want to sit outside.

56:51.667 --> 56:52.967
I see.

56:54.541 --> 56:57.791
And there was a big dog lying here.

56:58.571 --> 57:01.865
Oh really? I think I saw that dog too.

57:02.399 --> 57:04.087
A very big dog.

57:04.891 --> 57:07.564
- I think it was gray.
- Yes, you're right.

57:07.931 --> 57:09.867
- You saw that dog too?
- Yes!

57:09.968 --> 57:12.136
It's so strange.

57:12.965 --> 57:15.194
Yeah, this is a good sign.

57:15.513 --> 57:18.111
Because I saw the dog that you saw.

57:24.910 --> 57:27.896
There's a possibility that
that dog belongs here.

57:29.527 --> 57:30.827
Right.

57:30.928 --> 57:34.729
It's possible, because he was
lying here for a long time.

57:34.830 --> 57:36.253
And very comfortably.

57:36.891 --> 57:38.776
Perhaps we should ask the owner.

57:39.082 --> 57:40.634
- I'll wait here.
- Okay.

57:56.497 --> 58:02.013
Do you know what's most important
for me about a co-worker?

58:02.934 --> 58:04.314
Honesty.

58:05.014 --> 58:06.917
It's something precious.

58:07.501 --> 58:11.219
A natural born attribute.

58:11.808 --> 58:16.241
It's not something
you can achieve with time.

58:16.910 --> 58:19.939
That's why I hired you, you know that?

58:20.541 --> 58:22.167
I got it.

58:22.731 --> 58:24.031
Still...

58:24.251 --> 58:27.139
Even though I think
you have a good heart,

58:27.679 --> 58:30.335
I've come to the conclusion of what

58:30.436 --> 58:35.662
there's no guarantee of your honesty.

58:36.559 --> 58:38.905
Why did you come to this conclusion?

58:44.011 --> 58:46.751
Do you think I'm dishonest?

58:47.642 --> 58:49.133
Yes, a little.

58:49.476 --> 58:50.893
I just figured that out.

58:52.208 --> 58:55.416
I'm sorry. It's as I see it.

59:37.784 --> 59:39.717
Why do you take pictures?

59:42.159 --> 59:45.705
Because the only way to change things

59:46.451 --> 59:50.247
is to look at everything
again very slowly.

59:52.393 --> 59:54.474
That sounds very nice.

59:57.617 --> 01:00:00.204
- Do you want to drink something?
- Drink?

01:00:01.076 --> 01:00:03.065
Yes! Some wine, perhaps?

01:00:03.790 --> 01:00:05.914
I don't drink wine any more.

01:00:06.030 --> 01:00:08.659
I used to drink, but not anymore.

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:11.908
- Beer, then?
- Beer is fine.

01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:13.570
Okay.

01:01:17.451 --> 01:01:19.022
Does it have any meaning?

01:01:20.479 --> 01:01:21.779
No.

01:01:21.894 --> 01:01:23.988
I just want to do this.

01:01:25.605 --> 01:01:26.905
Why?

01:01:28.202 --> 01:01:30.370
Because I hate the whole world.

01:01:32.147 --> 01:01:34.171
You mean the life you're living?

01:01:34.781 --> 01:01:36.351
Yes, I guess so.

01:01:37.525 --> 01:01:39.176
They're same things.

01:01:49.353 --> 01:01:50.653
How many?

01:01:51.679 --> 01:01:52.979
22.

01:01:57.550 --> 01:01:59.022
And how do you feel?

01:01:59.248 --> 01:02:02.862
- I feel great, really great.
- Good!

01:02:04.688 --> 01:02:06.899
You can cut more clothes if you want.

01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:08.450
Yes, maybe.

01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:11.644
But I feel really good now.

01:02:12.621 --> 01:02:15.274
- They're beautiful.
- You think so?

01:02:16.257 --> 01:02:18.031
Yes, they are nice.

01:02:18.897 --> 01:02:21.853
Yes. They're gorgeous.

01:02:23.827 --> 01:02:25.785
What do you teach at the school?

01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:28.647
I teach music.

01:02:30.590 --> 01:02:33.090
- In high school.
- I see.

01:02:34.934 --> 01:02:36.764
Do you have a boyfriend?

01:02:38.442 --> 01:02:40.659
He passed away a few months ago.

01:02:44.368 --> 01:02:46.462
He was a bookstore owner.

01:02:47.753 --> 01:02:50.191
And he taught me piano, too.

01:03:04.264 --> 01:03:07.434
- Do you remember him often?
- Oh, yes.

01:03:08.282 --> 01:03:10.031
I remember him every day.

01:03:11.753 --> 01:03:13.477
He's still alive to me.

01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:18.690
He taught me how to live.

01:03:22.608 --> 01:03:25.650
When he died, I almost
wanted to commit suicide.

01:03:26.688 --> 01:03:28.536
You loved him that much?

01:03:29.741 --> 01:03:32.924
Oh, yes. I loved him very much.

01:03:34.399 --> 01:03:35.699
Great...

01:03:36.854 --> 01:03:40.874
- you love someone like that...
- Yes I know. I'm lucky.

01:03:41.261 --> 01:03:42.561
Yes.

01:03:51.039 --> 01:03:52.339
It's my boss.

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:56.167
She wants to see me now.

01:03:56.959 --> 01:04:00.401
She said she's right
in front of my place.

01:04:01.433 --> 01:04:04.074
- You'll see her?
- Let me see.

01:04:07.827 --> 01:04:09.127
She is here.

01:04:09.722 --> 01:04:13.293
It's so funny...
Why is she want to see me?

01:04:14.454 --> 01:04:15.754
You want me to go?

01:04:18.725 --> 01:04:20.899
I think you can stay.

01:04:21.925 --> 01:04:24.696
I'll go down first and talk to her.

01:04:24.873 --> 01:04:27.237
- And see what happens.
- Okay.

01:04:28.682 --> 01:04:32.339
- Can you stay?
- Oh sure, I have nothing to do.

01:04:32.541 --> 01:04:36.222
Okay, I'll be right back.
Have some apples there.

01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:59.601
- You're not cold?
- No, I'm okay.

01:05:01.101 --> 01:05:03.139
How did you know I was here?

01:05:04.368 --> 01:05:07.845
Sungyeon said you were here,
so I sent you a message.

01:05:08.836 --> 01:05:10.382
We need to talk.

01:05:10.584 --> 01:05:11.951
Sure.

01:05:13.181 --> 01:05:16.204
- Are you sure you're not cold?
- Yes.

01:05:55.414 --> 01:05:58.031
- You want help?
- No, go do your work.

01:06:08.411 --> 01:06:10.405
- I got it.
- No! Go do your work!
