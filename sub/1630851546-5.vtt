WEBVTT

00:08.051 --> 00:09.226
Got a minute?

00:09.270 --> 00:10.662
I know you're aware
that I don't,

00:10.706 --> 00:12.055
since another murder victim
just showed up

00:12.099 --> 00:13.709
with a frozen heart missing
from his chest.

00:13.752 --> 00:15.841
But I am willing to listen
to your questions and thoughts,

00:15.885 --> 00:18.018
so next time please just start
with those to be efficient.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.323
That was a lot of words

00:19.367 --> 00:20.759
for someone trying
to be efficient.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.370
Have you talked
to Temperance Hudson

00:22.413 --> 00:23.806
about Jake Cazine's death?

00:23.849 --> 00:25.242
She should be
a person of interest.

00:25.286 --> 00:27.505
She isn't. She has an alibi
for the time of death:

00:27.549 --> 00:29.246
coffee with me this morning.

00:29.290 --> 00:30.421
She ordered a croissant.

00:30.465 --> 00:31.857
Ah, let me guess.

00:31.901 --> 00:33.772
She engineered some
seemingly casual run-in with you

00:33.816 --> 00:35.339
because she needed something.

00:35.383 --> 00:38.038
If by "organized," you mean
she, uh, invited me, well, yes.

00:38.081 --> 00:39.387
We're both new in town.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.215
I was supposed
to have Sunday off. But...

00:41.258 --> 00:42.868
didn't strike me as suspicious.

00:42.912 --> 00:45.219
Why do you suggest her
as a person of interest?

00:45.262 --> 00:46.829
She lives
in a questionable house

00:46.872 --> 00:48.352
where questionable things
have happened.

00:48.396 --> 00:50.180
Okay, by that logic,

00:50.224 --> 00:51.616
I should interview her house.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.096
Appreciate you coming in.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.619
Do you?

00:54.663 --> 00:57.057
I thought
you'd been avoiding me.

00:58.101 --> 01:00.234
Why would I do that?

01:02.366 --> 01:05.152
Sometimes people
feel awkward

01:05.195 --> 01:08.981
when they've narrowly
avoided death together,

01:09.025 --> 01:11.723
especially when they've saved
each other's lives.

01:12.942 --> 01:14.683
I don't feel awkward.

01:14.726 --> 01:17.512
It is good to see you.

01:17.555 --> 01:19.818
Unfortunately, I am busy.

01:19.862 --> 01:22.908
Trying to catch
the other Frozen Hearts Killer.

01:22.952 --> 01:24.171
So, it looks like a copycat.

01:24.214 --> 01:25.998
What was Trott's reaction

01:26.042 --> 01:27.522
when you told him
about Jake's murder?

01:27.565 --> 01:29.480
Trott lawyered up.
He's not talking.

01:29.524 --> 01:31.613
Okay, but he told me
before he was arrested

01:31.656 --> 01:34.224
that he was a part
of something much bigger.[phone vibrating]

01:34.268 --> 01:37.140
What if that wasn't
just serial killer chitchat?

01:38.185 --> 01:39.751
Agent Park.

01:39.795 --> 01:41.362
[sighs]:
Understood.

01:41.405 --> 01:42.711
Start the process.

01:42.754 --> 01:44.147
[sets phone on desk]

01:44.191 --> 01:46.802
D.A.'s dropping all charges
against Trott.

01:46.845 --> 01:47.846
What?!

01:47.890 --> 01:49.413
Because of Jake Cazine?

01:49.457 --> 01:51.198
She thinks the fact
that Jake was killed

01:51.241 --> 01:52.416
while Trott was in custody
introduces

01:52.460 --> 01:54.157
too much reasonable doubt,
and a jury

01:54.201 --> 01:56.246
will never convict him
of last week's murders.

01:56.290 --> 01:58.248
But I found evidence
in his house.

01:58.292 --> 02:00.555
And-and-and what
about the murder in Alaska?

02:00.598 --> 02:02.339
Alaska's
not my case,

02:02.383 --> 02:04.167
and the evidence from the house
is inadmissible.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.429
The defense argued that

02:05.473 --> 02:07.475
the chain of custody
was violated...By me,

02:07.518 --> 02:10.130
because I was on the premises.When the courthouse

02:10.173 --> 02:11.827
opens tomorrow...

02:11.870 --> 02:13.350
Trott's gonna walk.

02:15.918 --> 02:18.399
â™ª

02:28.278 --> 02:31.238
CARSON: You ready
to talk to me now?

02:32.239 --> 02:34.023
Ready or not,
you're going to.

02:37.418 --> 02:39.376
This is my client Asher Davies.

02:39.420 --> 02:40.812
Have you seen him?

02:41.857 --> 02:43.163
No.

02:44.251 --> 02:46.601
He was supposed
to be cooperating with the D.A.

02:46.644 --> 02:48.037
in an investigation.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.082
Three nights ago,
he walked into a cannery

02:50.126 --> 02:51.649
and never came out.

02:51.693 --> 02:54.304
The same night,
you picked up Bertram Bobbsey

02:54.348 --> 02:57.742
outside that same cannery.

02:57.786 --> 02:59.570
What happened in there?

02:59.614 --> 03:01.964
I don't know.

03:02.007 --> 03:04.140
When Mr. Bobbsey
got back in my car,

03:04.184 --> 03:06.360
he had blood on
his knuckles.

03:06.403 --> 03:10.277
So I made him get out, and I
haven't heard from him since.

03:10.320 --> 03:13.280
I had nothing to do with
whatever happened in there.

03:13.323 --> 03:14.933
Except you did.

03:14.977 --> 03:17.284
From this, an argument
can still be made

03:17.327 --> 03:20.025
that you are connected
to whatever happened.

03:20.069 --> 03:23.420
If Bobbsey assaulted Asher,
you will be charged

03:23.464 --> 03:25.683
as an accessory
after the fact.

03:28.599 --> 03:31.341
I want to hire you
as my lawyer.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.083
I can't represent you,

03:34.126 --> 03:36.172
because I
already represent Asher.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.479
Go to the police.

03:38.522 --> 03:40.437
Tell them
everything you know.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.439
Maybe bring your father.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.224
If I get my dad involved,

03:44.267 --> 03:46.226
he might end up
arresting me himself.

03:46.269 --> 03:49.359
My mom won't be able
to handle that.She's going to have to,

03:49.403 --> 03:51.361
because sooner or later...No, no, no, no.
You don't...

03:51.405 --> 03:52.754
you don't get it.

03:52.797 --> 03:54.321
When my brother Grant

03:54.364 --> 03:56.497
came through town, and we
got him back into the WITSEC,

03:56.540 --> 03:58.150
I wanted to tell
her what happened,

03:58.194 --> 04:00.414
but my dad wants to keep her
on a need-to-know basis

04:00.457 --> 04:02.633
about everything,
because she worries,

04:02.677 --> 04:04.853
and she does have
a heart thing...Ace. Hey.

04:04.896 --> 04:07.986
You are connected
to whatever happened.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.901
So you can either do nothing

04:09.945 --> 04:12.252
and make things worse
for yourself

04:12.295 --> 04:14.689
and for everyone
who loves you...

04:14.732 --> 04:17.126
or you
can start making things right.

04:19.346 --> 04:21.348
[sighs]:
Oh, my God.

04:27.615 --> 04:31.053
ACE:
Mr. Bobbsey asked me
for some help with deliveries.

04:31.096 --> 04:33.664
Why is this in
an evidence bag?

04:33.708 --> 04:35.275
That was confiscated

04:35.318 --> 04:37.799
from an associate
of Bobbsey's.

04:37.842 --> 04:40.584
The D.A. thinks
that the gift tags

04:40.628 --> 04:43.805
contain coded messages
with times and places

04:43.848 --> 04:46.895
for transactions of some kind,
possibly drug deals.

04:46.938 --> 04:48.679
Well, what if I can decode
the cipher?

04:48.723 --> 04:50.812
And I'll find out
where the next meet is.

04:50.855 --> 04:53.336
Well, the D.A. would look
more favorably on you

04:53.380 --> 04:55.207
if you provide her
with information.

04:55.251 --> 04:57.035
I can tell her
that I have a lead,

04:57.079 --> 04:59.211
but I won't use
your name yet.
Do it.

05:02.389 --> 05:03.999
[sighs]

05:04.042 --> 05:06.349
[line ringing]Um, you know,

05:06.393 --> 05:08.569
Mr. Bobbsey left one of
his chocolate boxes in my car,

05:08.612 --> 05:10.875
so I can bring it
inside and show you.Okay.

05:10.919 --> 05:12.355
Jean.

05:12.399 --> 05:14.836
It's Carson.

05:14.879 --> 05:16.141
Hey.

05:16.185 --> 05:19.884
Uh, so, still no word
from Asher, um, but...

05:19.928 --> 05:24.193
I was able to discover something
on the surveillance footage

05:24.236 --> 05:27.414
from outside the cannery
the night that he disappeared.

05:29.024 --> 05:31.461
[engine starts]It was..

05:31.505 --> 05:32.854
Hang on.

05:32.897 --> 05:34.899
[tires squealing]

05:37.946 --> 05:40.252
NICK:
Hey, George.

05:40.296 --> 05:43.255
Hope you're getting done
whatever you need to get done.

05:43.299 --> 05:44.605
Um, little update.

05:44.648 --> 05:47.869
Ace called in sick,
and Bess had research to do

05:47.912 --> 05:49.566
at the Historical Society.

05:49.610 --> 05:52.221
But, you know, good news:

05:52.264 --> 05:54.484
very few customers.

05:54.528 --> 05:56.399
Yeah, that is...

05:56.443 --> 05:58.401
that is not actually good news,
but...

05:58.445 --> 05:59.837
You know, I'll call Jesse,

05:59.881 --> 06:01.665
see if she can come in.[door opens, bell jingles]

06:01.709 --> 06:04.320
Uh, call me back
when you can.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.713
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

06:05.756 --> 06:08.455
You're not here to pick up
Ace's shift, are you?

06:08.498 --> 06:10.152
He called in sick.Ha-ha.

06:10.195 --> 06:15.070
No, I just came to pick up some
notes from the murder board.

06:15.113 --> 06:17.159
Oh. Okay.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.380
[sighs heavily]

06:21.424 --> 06:23.383
You okay?

06:25.341 --> 06:27.299
Uh, yeah, yeah.

06:27.343 --> 06:29.301
I mean,
kind of freaked out

06:29.345 --> 06:31.434
there's a second murderer
at large.

06:31.478 --> 06:33.393
That's unsettling.
But...

06:33.436 --> 06:35.264
have you heard from George?

06:35.307 --> 06:37.266
She said she had
an errand to run,

06:37.309 --> 06:39.529
[chuckles]:
but she was extremely vague

06:39.573 --> 06:41.705
about what that errand was.

06:41.749 --> 06:44.316
That sounds like it's code
for something important,

06:44.360 --> 06:45.970
and I would be wondering
about it, too.

06:46.014 --> 06:47.276
[phone dings]

06:49.757 --> 06:51.715
She's gonna tell you
when she's ready, okay?

06:54.414 --> 06:56.851
NANCY:
Hey, I got your text.
Ace isn't here.

06:56.894 --> 06:58.069
He called in sick.

06:58.113 --> 06:59.723
CARSON:
Well, when you do see him,

06:59.767 --> 07:01.464
please have him call me
right away.

07:01.508 --> 07:02.857
I will.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.772
Also, I heard about Jake Cazine.

07:04.815 --> 07:06.817
Are you all right?

07:06.861 --> 07:09.211
[sighs]:
I'm fine.
Please tell my other dad

07:09.254 --> 07:10.647
not to worry about that, either.

07:10.691 --> 07:12.170
Well, Ryan's not here.

07:12.214 --> 07:14.999
He took a puddle jumper
to Boston early this morning.

07:15.043 --> 07:18.786
He's doing some fundraising
there for Nick's youth center.

07:18.829 --> 07:20.222
[sighs]

07:20.265 --> 07:24.008
I know the D.A. is
dropping charges against Trott.

07:24.052 --> 07:26.141
Which means that you're probably
trying to come up with a way

07:26.184 --> 07:27.490
to keep him in custody somehow.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.579
Yeah, well, people are dead.

07:29.623 --> 07:32.147
And it's not fair
that he could just walk away

07:32.190 --> 07:34.279
because that's how
the system works.

07:34.323 --> 07:36.804
I know. It is
a flawed and terrible system,

07:36.847 --> 07:39.284
but it's the only one we have.

07:39.328 --> 07:41.417
And, uh, speaking

07:41.461 --> 07:43.419
of the justice system
and your relationship to it...

07:43.463 --> 07:44.681
The answer is no.

07:44.725 --> 07:46.466
I didn't even say anything.

07:46.509 --> 07:48.119
You were going to ask

07:48.163 --> 07:50.600
if I could leverage my working
relationship with D.A. Rosario

07:50.644 --> 07:53.168
to covertly help you
gain access to Trott.

07:53.211 --> 07:54.386
I would never.

07:54.430 --> 07:57.520
By stealing a look
at her case files or...

07:57.564 --> 07:59.043
stealing her clearance badge.

07:59.087 --> 08:00.436
Mm, so she does have

08:00.480 --> 08:01.437
a clearance badge.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.525
You know where she keeps it?

08:02.569 --> 08:03.613
[exhales]

08:03.657 --> 08:05.180
I'll-I'll talk to you later.

08:05.223 --> 08:07.138
Bye.

08:14.232 --> 08:15.277
Hey.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.931
Hi.You feeling better?

08:16.974 --> 08:19.673
Carson's looking
for you.Yeah, thank you.

08:19.716 --> 08:22.937
I'll call him back.
Can you help me
solve a cipher?

08:22.980 --> 08:24.678
It's a long story, but
I need to figure out

08:24.721 --> 08:27.115
what the message
is in this thing.
Uh...

08:27.158 --> 08:29.639
I'm... I'm sorry,
I cannot do that right now.

08:29.683 --> 08:31.989
I have less than 24 hours
to make sure that Trott

08:32.033 --> 08:33.121
stays locked up.

08:33.164 --> 08:35.079
Speaking of,
do you think that Connor

08:35.123 --> 08:36.254
would let us see

08:36.298 --> 08:37.560
Jake Cazine's autopsy?

08:37.604 --> 08:39.214
Connor made it pretty clear
that he was done

08:39.257 --> 08:40.432
doing us favors.

08:40.476 --> 08:42.783
Anyway, I'm not sure
that Jake's autopsy

08:42.826 --> 08:44.698
will keep
Trott in jail.

08:44.741 --> 08:46.177
Yeah, you're right.

08:46.221 --> 08:48.223
He said he was a part
of something bigger.

08:48.266 --> 08:49.572
I need
a more global approach

08:49.616 --> 08:50.704
to the whole thing.

08:50.747 --> 08:53.358
If only there was a way...

08:53.402 --> 08:56.492
for me to see a bird's-eye view
of the case.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.626
Why do I get the feeling
that's not a hypothetical?It isn't

08:59.669 --> 09:01.671
if you have the phone number
of a 200-year-old occultist

09:01.715 --> 09:03.238
who knows how to see
people's memories.

09:03.281 --> 09:05.457
Maybe she'll have
some mystical way

09:05.501 --> 09:08.504
to find a clue trail that
wouldn't otherwise be visible.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.507
Is this the part
where you warn me

09:11.551 --> 09:13.117
that Temperance is chaotic evil?

09:13.161 --> 09:14.641
I'm not really
in a position

09:14.684 --> 09:17.295
to judge
other people's gambits.

09:17.339 --> 09:19.080
Care to join?

09:20.168 --> 09:23.650
I wish I could, but I got
to deal with this other thing.

09:24.694 --> 09:26.696
Just, uh,
be careful

09:26.740 --> 09:28.655
around your mystical relatives.Aw,

09:28.698 --> 09:30.700
what's she gonna do,
bathe in my blood again?

09:33.398 --> 09:34.443
I'll be fine.

09:39.622 --> 09:41.406
EDWIN: Sorry I don't have
any snacks to offer.

09:41.450 --> 09:44.061
I thought about putting in
a vending machine at one point,

09:44.105 --> 09:46.107
but it seemed
self-serving.

09:46.150 --> 09:49.632
Candy equals cavities
equals business.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.634
I try to keep
a good word of mouth

09:51.678 --> 09:54.115
around here, you know?

09:54.158 --> 09:55.551
Yeah.

09:57.335 --> 09:59.903
I-Is that
how you found me?

09:59.947 --> 10:03.254
My... dentistry practice?

10:04.299 --> 10:05.735
I've always known
where you were.

10:05.779 --> 10:08.738
And I know you live by yourself.

10:08.782 --> 10:11.436
Wasn't that hard to keep track
of someone named Chen,

10:11.480 --> 10:13.743
especially someone
whose middle name I inherited.

10:15.789 --> 10:18.661
[exhales]
What else did your mother
tell you about me?

10:18.705 --> 10:20.707
She said
that you...

10:20.750 --> 10:24.798
had an epic teen romance...
that ended

10:24.841 --> 10:28.279
about ten months after you
got her pregnant with me.

10:29.716 --> 10:32.588
After which
we never saw you again.

10:32.632 --> 10:36.853
So I was surprised when I
got your friend request.

10:38.855 --> 10:40.683
If you found out
that I'm getting married

10:40.727 --> 10:42.511
and you expect
to walk me down the aisle,

10:42.554 --> 10:44.774
let me just tell you...I'm not expecting
anything.

10:44.818 --> 10:47.081
I friend-buttoned you

10:47.124 --> 10:48.517
because I recently
read something...

10:48.560 --> 10:49.736
"Friend-buttoned" me?

10:49.779 --> 10:51.738
[knocking]Okay, look...

10:51.781 --> 10:52.913
[knocking continues]

10:52.956 --> 10:55.089
I-I should...
I should probably get that.

10:55.132 --> 10:57.091
[pounding]Yeah.

10:57.134 --> 10:58.309
[sighs]

11:00.398 --> 11:01.748
[door opens]

11:01.791 --> 11:03.924
Dr. Chen,
I-I know this is your day off,

11:03.967 --> 11:06.013
but Jonah,
he was riding his bike too fast,

11:06.056 --> 11:07.623
there was this pothole...

11:07.667 --> 11:09.146
JONAH [sobbing]:
It went too fast.

11:09.190 --> 11:10.408
It's not my fault.

11:10.452 --> 11:12.410
EDWIN:Okay, okay.
Hey, can I...

11:12.454 --> 11:14.412
can I take a look,
and let's see what...

11:14.456 --> 11:15.762
Yeah. Okay.

11:15.805 --> 11:17.415
All right,
come on in.

11:17.459 --> 11:18.590
Come on in.

11:21.245 --> 11:23.639
Oh, there's someone
ahead of us.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.817
I can wait.

11:28.905 --> 11:31.647
Okay, let's go take a seat
on the chair, okay?

11:32.648 --> 11:33.823
All right, Jonah...

11:33.867 --> 11:36.391
[phone vibrating]

11:41.570 --> 11:43.703
Hey, it's George.
Leave a short message.

11:43.746 --> 11:44.747
[beep]

11:44.791 --> 11:45.966
[door opens, bell jingles]

11:47.010 --> 11:48.316
Oh.

11:48.359 --> 11:49.752
Hey.

11:49.796 --> 11:52.929
Welcome to The Claw.

11:52.973 --> 11:54.365
Uh, coffee?

11:57.412 --> 11:59.675
Oh, uh, he called in sick.

12:03.635 --> 12:06.813
Hmm. Well, uh,
maybe he's at,

12:06.856 --> 12:10.033
uh, Fred's Towing.

12:18.128 --> 12:19.347
Strange?

12:19.390 --> 12:21.001
I... I don't understand.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.006
Oh.

12:26.049 --> 12:27.268
Can I help?

12:27.311 --> 12:30.227
I could go with you
to Fred's Towing.

12:37.539 --> 12:39.497
Um, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.673
I have, uh, I have time.

12:43.414 --> 12:45.286
So much time.

12:46.374 --> 12:49.638
TEMPERANCE:
I'm always happy to help family.

12:49.681 --> 12:53.250
And my most
promising pupil.

12:53.294 --> 12:55.818
I didn't expect you
to say yes.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.603
Why? She helped you
with the hat guy-thing.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.479
And I care about

13:04.522 --> 13:07.090
the well-being of this town.

13:07.134 --> 13:09.527
So, how can I help?

13:09.571 --> 13:12.617
Well, there is a connection

13:12.661 --> 13:15.359
between Trott and whoever
killed Jake Cazine.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.100
Trott told me he's a part
of something much bigger,

13:17.144 --> 13:18.623
and I need to know
what he means by that.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.974
I'm trying to make sure that
he doesn't get out of custody

13:21.017 --> 13:22.889
because of some
arbitrary loophole.

13:22.932 --> 13:26.370
Let a murderer go.
How infuriating.

13:26.414 --> 13:27.850
Nancy feels the same way.

13:27.894 --> 13:30.679
I just was hoping that there's
some sort of ritual

13:30.722 --> 13:32.637
that could help me see
the bigger picture,

13:32.681 --> 13:33.638
like a bird's-eye view.

13:33.682 --> 13:36.859
I could attempt
a modification

13:36.903 --> 13:38.992
to the Memory Weave ritual

13:39.035 --> 13:43.779
to see which memory had the most
emotional significance,

13:43.823 --> 13:47.565
if you can get us access
to Trott in his cell.

13:47.609 --> 13:49.829
That is a tall order,

13:49.872 --> 13:52.309
but those are
Nancy's specialties.

13:52.353 --> 13:55.051
Makes her a great
detective and waitress.

13:55.095 --> 13:57.445
It might be doable. The
station's stretched pretty thin,

13:57.488 --> 13:59.490
but w-we would have
to get past Agent Park.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.144
[phone chimes]TEMPERANCE: Hi, Nelson.

14:01.188 --> 14:03.668
I believe the other killer
broke into my home

14:03.712 --> 14:05.235
the day of the first murders.

14:05.279 --> 14:07.977
If you could please meet me
at Icarus Hall

14:08.021 --> 14:11.720
to look for clues they
might have left behind.

14:11.763 --> 14:12.852
Sent.

14:12.895 --> 14:15.942
He is definitely
not gonna buy that.

14:15.985 --> 14:17.726
[phone whooshes]Oh.

14:17.769 --> 14:19.989
He just did.

14:20.033 --> 14:23.471
And he's on his way
to Icarus Hall.

14:23.514 --> 14:27.344
Bess, perhaps you could
intercept him when he arrives.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.216
Absolutely.
Count me in.

14:29.259 --> 14:30.957
NANCY:
Looks like we have
maybe three hours

14:31.000 --> 14:33.742
to get in, get info, get out
and not get caught.

14:33.785 --> 14:35.265
Great.

14:35.309 --> 14:37.877
Team NaTempEss...Oh.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.879
...assemble.

14:45.319 --> 14:47.930
You were smart to save the
chipped piece when you found it.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.758
This guy's good in a crisis.

14:49.801 --> 14:52.587
You're doing good, buddy.No wonder you took a tumble.

14:52.630 --> 14:54.806
[phone vibrating]The potholes around here
are like asteroid craters.

14:54.850 --> 14:57.984
Hey. Uh, I was gonna
call you back. Sorry.

14:58.027 --> 14:59.202
NICK:
I was just checking in.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.204
I'm helping Ace's dad
with something,

15:01.248 --> 15:03.163
so Jesse's covering at The Claw.

15:03.206 --> 15:05.556
Cool. I'm still stuck
at the dentist.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.036
Oh, dentist.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.690
I didn't know
you had an appointment.Yeah.

15:08.733 --> 15:10.779
Just... just a little plaque.

15:10.822 --> 15:13.390
Oh, no, no, no, I didn't mean
your teeth, I just...

15:13.434 --> 15:18.047
It's just, um, this morning
before you left,

15:18.091 --> 15:19.353
it seemed like

15:19.396 --> 15:21.007
you had something
on your mind.

15:21.050 --> 15:23.966
Yeah, well, a ten-year life
expectancy will do that to you.

15:24.010 --> 15:26.447
Listen, if it stresses you out
to think about it, then...

15:26.490 --> 15:27.752
I'm not stressed out, okay?

15:27.796 --> 15:29.711
I'm watching this guy work,
and I'm jealous.

15:29.754 --> 15:31.147
EDWIN:
So good.

15:31.191 --> 15:32.975
I wish that I had a dentist
like this growing up.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.846
Oh.

15:34.890 --> 15:37.153
It just feels like everyone gets
to have these dentists

15:37.197 --> 15:39.329
who are, like, you know,
they care about how you feel

15:39.373 --> 15:41.505
and they hold your hand
when you're scared, or...

15:41.549 --> 15:43.246
they're, like, protective
and reliable

15:43.290 --> 15:46.075
and-and psyched
to be your da-- dentist.

15:46.119 --> 15:48.556
All right, I got to go.
I'll be back soon.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.253
All right...[line clicks]

15:58.261 --> 16:01.525
Uh, yeah, yeah.

16:01.569 --> 16:04.441
Uh, my fiancÃ© is
at the dentist.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.404
[engine stalls]

16:11.796 --> 16:15.017
So, when you said

16:15.061 --> 16:18.020
"visit" Fred's Towing,

16:18.064 --> 16:21.937
you meant "stake out"
Fred's Towing.

16:26.855 --> 16:29.075
Ah. True.

16:34.602 --> 16:36.996
Still no text from Ace.

16:47.745 --> 16:51.271
Oh, uh, it's great.

16:51.314 --> 16:52.794
It's great, yeah.

16:52.837 --> 16:55.753
I mean, honestly,
I never thought

16:55.797 --> 17:00.019
I'd be married,
um, so young.

17:06.112 --> 17:09.071
Yeah, yeah.

17:09.115 --> 17:12.944
I mean, George is unique.
[chuckles]

17:12.988 --> 17:15.686
Can I ask?

17:15.730 --> 17:19.168
How did you know

17:19.212 --> 17:22.215
your wife was the one?

17:22.258 --> 17:24.913
I mean, what-what made you

17:24.956 --> 17:27.611
decide to propose?

17:57.337 --> 17:59.121
Temperance should be back
any moment.

17:59.165 --> 18:01.297
Oh, no, that's okay,
thank you.

18:01.341 --> 18:03.952
I'm gonna call Temperance,
we'll reschedule and, uh,

18:03.995 --> 18:05.171
we'll get some techs out here
and examine

18:05.214 --> 18:07.129
exactly where
the home invasion happened.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.652
Appreciate you
showing me around, though.

18:08.696 --> 18:10.393
But the killer is
still out there, right?

18:10.437 --> 18:12.874
Could you maybe stay
until Temperance returns?

18:12.917 --> 18:14.832
I'm-I'm really frightened.

18:14.876 --> 18:17.139
Yeah, if you're not
comfortable here,

18:17.183 --> 18:18.488
I can give you a ride
back to town.

18:18.532 --> 18:21.404
No, you see, I said
to Temperance that we'd wait.

18:21.448 --> 18:25.539
Please... take a seat.

18:25.582 --> 18:26.931
[cat mewls]Ooh!

18:26.975 --> 18:28.890
What was that?

18:28.933 --> 18:30.631
[cat growling]Ah... [chuckles]

18:38.334 --> 18:42.164
There's my handsome mister.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.861
Goochie-goo.
[chuckles]

18:43.905 --> 18:46.212
With all the killings
going on,

18:46.255 --> 18:48.083
we've been staying
with Temperance.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.432
So I'm just gonna
put him in another room

18:49.476 --> 18:51.260
so he can be comfier.

18:51.304 --> 18:52.783
[cat screeching][screams]

18:53.697 --> 18:56.483
It's okay, it's just me.

18:56.526 --> 19:00.182
[screams, gasps]

19:03.229 --> 19:06.014
Wait, wait, wait.

19:08.234 --> 19:11.062
I'm afraid your cat
is no longer alive.

19:11.106 --> 19:13.456
Thank God.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.764
For granting him peace.

19:16.807 --> 19:18.548
[chuckles]

19:18.592 --> 19:21.812
He's just been so very ill.

19:21.856 --> 19:25.468
Do you, um...

19:25.512 --> 19:26.904
think you could
help me bury him?

19:26.948 --> 19:29.211
Please. I-I just bought him

19:29.255 --> 19:31.822
a little bowtie that's still
on its way from Etsy.

19:31.866 --> 19:34.260
[sobs]
Please don't cry.

19:34.303 --> 19:37.611
I'll help you bury your cat.

19:37.654 --> 19:39.656
Thank you.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.136
I'll get a shovel.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.225
[sighs]

19:45.227 --> 19:46.620
Dad, if you're calling me
'cause you're using

19:46.663 --> 19:48.230
the tracking app
on my phone again,

19:48.274 --> 19:51.190
I am at the police station
on community liaison business.

19:51.233 --> 19:52.756
I'm calling because
I still haven't

19:52.800 --> 19:54.584
heard from Ace,
and his father and I

19:54.628 --> 19:55.585
are starting to get
really worried.

19:55.629 --> 19:56.586
He didn't call you?

19:56.630 --> 19:58.719
He stopped by work today.

19:58.762 --> 20:01.200
He-he mentioned something
about a crossword cipher.

20:01.243 --> 20:02.723
Have you solved it yet?

20:02.766 --> 20:04.246
ACE:
Can you help me solve a cipher?

20:04.290 --> 20:06.030
I need to figure out what
the message is in this thing.

20:06.074 --> 20:08.381
No, but I can now.

20:08.424 --> 20:09.643
Why are you worried about Ace?

20:09.686 --> 20:10.948
He's in way over his head

20:10.992 --> 20:12.950
with Bertram Bobbsey.

20:12.994 --> 20:14.691
The cipher might tell us
where he's headed.

20:17.128 --> 20:18.739
Thank you.

20:18.782 --> 20:22.569
[muttering]:
Two across. "Ten out of ten."

20:22.612 --> 20:24.875
Okay, the first...

20:24.919 --> 20:27.965
the first letter of each word?
No, last letter? No.

20:28.009 --> 20:30.751
First letter
in reverse order...

20:33.623 --> 20:35.364
Mm.

20:35.408 --> 20:37.105
550 Bay View.

20:37.148 --> 20:38.802
8:00 p.m. Sunday.

20:38.846 --> 20:41.718
That's tonight.I don't know how
he'll get there.

20:41.762 --> 20:43.503
Thom said Ace's car
is still in the shop.

20:43.546 --> 20:45.287
Then look for Ryan's car.

20:45.331 --> 20:47.811
Why would Ryan loan out his car?

20:47.855 --> 20:48.943
Well, he wouldn't
just loan it out,

20:48.986 --> 20:50.466
but he'd barter it
for something.

20:50.510 --> 20:53.295
Haven't you noticed our
sparkling clean dishes

20:53.339 --> 20:54.949
organized by size?

20:54.992 --> 20:58.735
It's the same way
Ace does it at The Claw.

20:58.779 --> 21:02.043
You think Ryan is outsourcing
his duties on the chore wheel?

21:02.086 --> 21:03.697
Ryan doesn't have any cash.

21:03.740 --> 21:08.310
So I am guessing that
he trades his car privileges

21:08.354 --> 21:10.181
for Ace's dishwashing.

21:10.225 --> 21:11.748
After I track down Ace,

21:11.792 --> 21:15.274
we are going to have
a serious family discussion.

21:15.317 --> 21:16.710
Okay, I got to go.

21:16.753 --> 21:18.102
As much as I would love
to unpack why a grown man

21:18.146 --> 21:19.756
needs a chore wheel
to be held accountable

21:19.800 --> 21:21.323
for basic human
responsibilities,

21:21.367 --> 21:22.498
we really don't
have time for that.

21:33.727 --> 21:34.728
What is that?

21:41.082 --> 21:43.302
Just clearing the air.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.347
Time to break into
a serial killer's brain.

21:56.184 --> 21:59.753
PARK [sighs]:
I am sorry about your cat.

21:59.796 --> 22:02.625
Oh, well, why don't you,
um, say a few words?

22:02.669 --> 22:07.151
You're stalling me,
keeping me from my office.

22:07.195 --> 22:09.023
You want to tell me
what's going on here?

22:11.112 --> 22:15.421
What is going on here is that
a living creature just died.

22:15.464 --> 22:18.728
Its soul left this earth,
like all of ours will one day.

22:18.772 --> 22:20.600
He left a mark,

22:20.643 --> 22:22.297
and that deserves a moment
of your time.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.386
If you can't spare
two minutes,

22:24.430 --> 22:27.389
then that is not a job
worth having.

22:27.433 --> 22:30.000
[sighs]

22:30.044 --> 22:33.090
Uh, what was your cat's
name again?

22:33.134 --> 22:36.703
Uh, Sir Gray

22:36.746 --> 22:40.533
Rock... Wall.

22:40.576 --> 22:43.927
Uh...

22:43.971 --> 22:46.539
Sir Gray Rock Wall...Mm.

22:46.582 --> 22:49.324
...you were loved, and
your memory will live on

22:49.368 --> 22:51.065
in the hearts of those
who knew you.

22:51.108 --> 22:53.197
May you find soft pillows
to nap on

22:53.241 --> 22:56.636
when you cross
the Rainbow Bridge.

22:56.679 --> 22:57.854
That was lovely.

22:57.898 --> 23:01.815
Especially the part
about the bridge.

23:01.858 --> 23:03.773
I heard the term
during my psych residency.

23:03.817 --> 23:06.167
Worked with kids a lot.

23:06.210 --> 23:07.473
We'd compare thoughts
on the great beyond.

23:07.516 --> 23:11.433
Didn't expect you to believe
in the afterlife.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.914
You seem a man of science.

23:13.957 --> 23:16.307
Science doesn't always
get you the last word

23:16.351 --> 23:19.006
in every situation.

23:19.049 --> 23:22.139
I really do have to
head back, though.

23:22.183 --> 23:24.664
We should gather flowers!

23:24.707 --> 23:26.274
Shoot.

23:30.670 --> 23:32.019
Mayday, mayday.

23:34.282 --> 23:35.849
[phone chimes]

23:35.892 --> 23:38.765
Oh, Agent Park is
on his way back.

23:38.808 --> 23:41.028
I'll make this fast.

23:42.986 --> 23:46.686
Nancy Drew.

23:46.729 --> 23:48.035
You're here because

23:48.078 --> 23:50.298
you can't get me
out of your head.

23:50.341 --> 23:53.388
I'm here to learn about the
other Frozen Hearts Killer.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.434
So that you both are
held responsible

23:55.477 --> 23:56.826
for what you did.

23:56.870 --> 24:00.613
Whatever this game is,
I'm not interested.

24:00.656 --> 24:02.136
I want my lawyer.

24:02.179 --> 24:04.878
I want my lawyer!

24:04.921 --> 24:07.184
TEMPERANCE:
No one can hear you.

24:07.228 --> 24:10.449
Focus your mind on the case.

24:11.928 --> 24:15.323
NANCY:
You said you were a part
of something much bigger.

24:15.366 --> 24:17.281
Who else are you working with?

24:21.285 --> 24:22.417
There's Trott.

24:24.593 --> 24:27.030
NANCY:
He's seeing himself
as a child.

24:30.338 --> 24:32.471
What is this place?

24:40.174 --> 24:43.133
[low growl]

24:43.177 --> 24:45.788
That's the other
Frozen Hearts Killer.

24:45.832 --> 24:48.530
He tried to attack me
at Icarus Hall.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.361
But this killer's
not human.

24:53.404 --> 24:56.016
It's a supernatural entity.

24:59.889 --> 25:02.370
[low moan]

25:02.413 --> 25:04.546
Hey, what is that?

25:06.417 --> 25:08.202
TROTT:
I don't want you here.

25:11.248 --> 25:12.380
Get out.

25:12.423 --> 25:14.382
Trott's consciousness
is fighting us.

25:14.425 --> 25:16.297
We don't have much time.

25:16.340 --> 25:18.647
Wait, you're-
you're hurting him.

25:18.691 --> 25:20.388
Ask what you need to know!

25:20.431 --> 25:24.305
What is that thing in the cage?
Are you working together?

25:24.348 --> 25:26.089
I'm part of something
much bigger.

25:26.133 --> 25:28.918
Are you a friend
to this creature?

25:28.962 --> 25:31.399
I was inspired by it.
How?

25:31.442 --> 25:33.401
I went exploring
when I was ten.

25:33.444 --> 25:34.881
That's when I found it.

25:34.924 --> 25:37.492
I came back so many times
to watch it reap hearts

25:37.536 --> 25:38.754
with an icy touch.

25:38.798 --> 25:41.757
I tried to copy
its perfection but couldn't.

25:41.801 --> 25:43.237
No matter how hard I tried,

25:43.280 --> 25:45.108
I wasn't able to free it
from its cage.

25:45.152 --> 25:46.545
What else?!

25:47.720 --> 25:50.287
That is enough.It isn't safe here.

25:52.202 --> 25:54.422
Temperance, come back!

25:56.293 --> 25:58.905
We have to go. Now.

26:06.303 --> 26:08.567
If that bonding gives
you any trouble at all,

26:08.610 --> 26:10.481
please give me a
call right away.

26:10.525 --> 26:14.094
Jonah, I'll see you and
your tooth again next week.

26:14.137 --> 26:16.139
Thanks so much, Doctor.Not a problem.

26:16.183 --> 26:17.619
Take care.

26:17.663 --> 26:20.404
[door closes]

26:20.448 --> 26:22.537
Do any of your
super-nice patients know

26:22.581 --> 26:25.366
that you abandoned
a teenage mom and her baby?

26:25.409 --> 26:27.455
[sighs sharply]

26:27.498 --> 26:31.111
If I had stayed...

26:31.154 --> 26:33.592
I would have been trapped
in a dead-end life.

26:35.550 --> 26:36.638
I made the best decision

26:36.682 --> 26:39.119
that I could for myself
at the time.

26:39.162 --> 26:40.511
I know it was selfish.

26:40.555 --> 26:42.688
Oh, you're damn right
it was selfish.

26:42.731 --> 26:46.256
It screwed up my whole life.

26:46.300 --> 26:47.910
Do you know that
I had to work

26:47.954 --> 26:49.999
three times as hard
as anyone else

26:50.043 --> 26:52.611
so that I could provide
for our family?

26:52.654 --> 26:54.613
Do you know that
I looked for approval

26:54.656 --> 26:56.658
from men who were
way older than me

26:56.702 --> 26:59.182
because it was a way for me
to feel not so alone?

26:59.226 --> 27:01.271
I deserved better than that.

27:01.315 --> 27:03.926
I deserved better than
a freaking friend request

27:03.970 --> 27:06.146
18 years too late!

27:06.189 --> 27:07.930
I deserved a father who loved me

27:07.974 --> 27:10.063
and thought that I was worth
taking care of.

27:10.106 --> 27:12.761
Yes. Yes, you did.

27:12.805 --> 27:15.242
You're an amazing person.

27:15.285 --> 27:16.722
You don't even know me.

27:16.765 --> 27:18.811
You don't get to say that!

27:18.854 --> 27:20.508
I know what
I recently read.

27:20.551 --> 27:24.120
A website full of stories
about Detective George.

27:24.164 --> 27:26.122
[exhales sharply]

27:26.166 --> 27:30.213
The Fan Fan website.
Of course.

27:30.257 --> 27:31.258
Where else would
I have learned that

27:31.301 --> 27:32.563
you're an indomitable fighter?

27:32.607 --> 27:34.653
Detective George
never gives up

27:34.696 --> 27:36.176
when a case gets hard.

27:36.219 --> 27:39.135
And she faces all
of her challenges head-on.

27:40.746 --> 27:43.662
Not many people have
that kind of willpower.

27:43.705 --> 27:45.315
If your takeaway
from this website was

27:45.359 --> 27:47.274
that I turned out okay
without you,

27:47.317 --> 27:48.667
please do not pretend

27:48.710 --> 27:50.451
like you did me a favor
by leaving.

27:50.494 --> 27:52.192
You do not get to
sleep easier at night.

27:52.235 --> 27:53.236
Look, I just...

27:53.280 --> 27:55.064
I just want to tell you

27:55.108 --> 27:57.414
that I'm sorry I hurt you.

28:03.290 --> 28:07.294
I almost did back down... once.

28:07.337 --> 28:09.426
A couple years ago.

28:13.082 --> 28:14.910
We were two months behind
on rent,

28:14.954 --> 28:17.739
and Victoria was off the grid
on a binge.

28:17.783 --> 28:22.004
And I was trying
very, very hard

28:22.048 --> 28:23.876
to keep things together,
but of course

28:23.919 --> 28:26.400
one night I burnt
our microwave dinner

28:26.443 --> 28:28.707
and the smoke alarm
went off.

28:28.750 --> 28:30.404
And you know what?

28:30.447 --> 28:33.363
Everyone was yelling at me.

28:34.669 --> 28:39.543
And I thought to myself,
how is this my life?

28:39.587 --> 28:41.676
So I packed a bag.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.331
I packed a bag and I looked up
the bus schedules to Boston,

28:44.374 --> 28:47.726
and I was about ready
to go, for real.

28:50.206 --> 28:52.208
But I didn't.

28:53.514 --> 28:55.690
I stayed.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.780
Because I love my sisters,
and they need me.

29:05.134 --> 29:07.397
You must think I'm a monster.

29:12.751 --> 29:17.233
I think you're disappointing.

29:17.277 --> 29:19.496
You only cared about yourself
at a time

29:19.540 --> 29:22.282
when I really, really
needed a father.

29:22.325 --> 29:25.720
But no,

29:25.764 --> 29:28.157
I do not think that
you are a monster.

29:28.201 --> 29:32.640
And as much as part of me wants
to stay mad at you forever,

29:32.683 --> 29:35.904
I need that energy
for other things now.

29:41.431 --> 29:43.085

[police siren wails]Horseshoe Bay PD!

30:31.438 --> 30:32.395
Hands where we can see them.

30:32.439 --> 30:35.137
I got this one.

30:35.181 --> 30:37.139
What is that?

30:37.183 --> 30:38.662
All right, on your feet.

30:40.229 --> 30:43.015
Hey, hands up!He's not with them.

30:43.058 --> 30:44.233
You tip off the cops?

30:44.277 --> 30:45.844
It wasn't him.

30:45.887 --> 30:47.758
Asher Davies,
you're under arrest

30:47.802 --> 30:49.151
for violation of your parole.

30:52.938 --> 30:54.896
[indistinct radio transmission]

31:11.608 --> 31:16.309
Something made that entity
graduate from rats to humans.

31:16.352 --> 31:17.832
We should have stayed there
and looked for more information.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.573
Why did you push me
out of the weave?

31:19.616 --> 31:21.183
What didn't you want me to see?

31:21.227 --> 31:23.185
Trott's memory was
about to collapse.

31:23.229 --> 31:26.101
I had to act quickly, or else
we'd be trapped forever.[door opens]

31:26.145 --> 31:30.758
Agent Park. Our wires
must have gotten crossed.

31:30.801 --> 31:32.412
Yeah, you said to
meet at Icarus Hall.

31:32.455 --> 31:33.979
Autocorrect is my nemesis.

31:34.022 --> 31:36.546
How about we talk
over coffee now?

31:36.590 --> 31:38.505
After you change
your clothes.

31:38.548 --> 31:40.420
Yeah, your houseguest's
cat died.

31:40.463 --> 31:42.770
She requested help
with the funeral.

31:42.813 --> 31:44.250
Nancy?
Hmm?

31:44.293 --> 31:45.947
What are you doing here?

31:45.991 --> 31:48.167
Community liaison-ing.

31:48.210 --> 31:50.952
Agent Park, Trott collapsed in
his cell; he's unresponsive.

31:50.996 --> 31:52.911
I think it may be a stroke.
I called the paramedics.

31:52.954 --> 31:54.390
Stay with Trott
till they arrive.

31:54.434 --> 31:56.915
I'll check the security feed
from the holding area.

31:56.958 --> 31:59.787
There's no cameras
by the cell.Oh, I had one installed

31:59.830 --> 32:01.310
after Trott was
transferred here.

32:01.354 --> 32:03.225
It'll show me what happened
right before he collapsed.

32:13.496 --> 32:16.064
[audio static]

32:18.762 --> 32:20.547
Oh, dear.

32:23.463 --> 32:26.988
I'm gonna walk Temperance
to her car.

32:27.032 --> 32:30.122
Why? Is she unwell?

32:30.165 --> 32:32.994
We enjoy each
other's company.

32:45.833 --> 32:48.705
You did something
to that camera.

32:50.229 --> 32:52.013
You're welcome.

32:52.057 --> 32:53.101
I'm dismayed you didn't think
to check for one.

32:53.145 --> 32:54.450
Because I'm supposed

32:54.494 --> 32:57.627
to ask Park for the station's
security layout?

32:57.671 --> 32:59.325
You stayed behind in the weave

32:59.368 --> 33:01.414
for almost ten seconds
without me,

33:01.457 --> 33:04.199
and then suddenly Trott
is collapsed on the floor

33:04.243 --> 33:06.375
with a stroke.

33:06.419 --> 33:07.637
You did something to him.

33:07.681 --> 33:09.030
I'm not a wizard.
I can't just

33:09.074 --> 33:12.555
give people brain hemorrhages.

33:12.599 --> 33:14.166
But if I did
give Trott a stroke,

33:14.209 --> 33:16.559
would you want me
to fix him right now?

33:16.603 --> 33:18.648
So that tomorrow morning
he could flee the country

33:18.692 --> 33:20.389
and never be seen again?

33:20.433 --> 33:23.697
Would the families
of his victims want that?

33:23.740 --> 33:27.309
Part of you is glad
he was hurt.

33:27.353 --> 33:30.747
It's all right to admit it.

33:30.791 --> 33:35.535
I've never had much faith
in the system either.

33:35.578 --> 33:38.320
Wouldn't it be nice
if there were a world where

33:38.364 --> 33:42.324
people took justice
into their own hands?

33:42.368 --> 33:44.022
I just wanted answers
from Trott.

33:44.065 --> 33:45.371
I never wanted to hurt him.

33:45.414 --> 33:47.025
Don't feel sorry for him.

33:47.068 --> 33:49.810
You have to think bigger
if you're going to fulfill

33:49.853 --> 33:53.031
your true destiny,
like my card said.

34:15.966 --> 34:17.881
Okay, you're exaggerating.

34:30.111 --> 34:32.766
I wanted to help Amanda, okay?

34:32.809 --> 34:35.377
At first I was just
giving Bobbsey rides.

34:37.162 --> 34:39.555
I guess I learned it from you.

34:39.599 --> 34:41.340
When not sure, keep it secret.

34:44.778 --> 34:47.607
You won't talk about
what's going on with you.

34:47.650 --> 34:50.349
You won't... you
won't talk about,

34:50.392 --> 34:51.524
about your life from before,

34:51.567 --> 34:53.308
when you were a U.S. Marshal.

34:56.224 --> 34:58.139
Yeah, but if you were just
honest with me to begin with,

34:58.183 --> 35:00.315
I wouldn't have gone searching
for your secret son.

35:00.359 --> 35:01.360
REBECCA:
Ace?

35:05.190 --> 35:08.236
What do you mean,
"secret son"?

35:10.891 --> 35:12.893
Mom, what are you doing here?

35:13.937 --> 35:15.852
I was closing up
the library,

35:15.896 --> 35:20.030
and the police said
we had to wait inside.

35:20.074 --> 35:23.643
They just opened the doors.

35:23.686 --> 35:27.125
Why did he say
you have a "secret son"?

35:31.129 --> 35:32.565
What is he not
supposed to say?

35:34.219 --> 35:35.655
Obviously there is.

35:38.919 --> 35:40.268
Don't blame this on me.

35:40.312 --> 35:41.443
Ace is right.

35:41.487 --> 35:42.618
You're deflecting.

35:47.536 --> 35:49.190
No, I'm not a child.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.201
Please calm down.

36:00.245 --> 36:02.334
Just calm down!Mom,

36:02.377 --> 36:03.683
I'm sorry,
nobody wanted you

36:03.726 --> 36:05.467
to find out this way, but you...

36:05.511 --> 36:07.077
Stop talking!

36:07.121 --> 36:09.297
I want you gone!

36:09.341 --> 36:11.343
Tonight!

36:16.261 --> 36:17.958
[shudders]

36:18.001 --> 36:19.916
Oh...

36:31.319 --> 36:34.192
You know, I just
buried a revenant cat.

36:34.235 --> 36:37.412
Kegstand went missing after
Trott killed his owner Dustin,

36:37.456 --> 36:38.718
and Agent Park

36:38.761 --> 36:40.763
very nearly spotted
his name tag.

36:40.807 --> 36:43.375
So why was Kegstand here?He was a witness

36:43.418 --> 36:45.028
to Dustin's murder.

36:45.072 --> 36:47.030
I needed him for a ritual
to learn more

36:47.074 --> 36:49.163
about the killers
terrorizing Horseshoe Bay.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.338
So you...

36:50.382 --> 36:52.949
killed Kegstand?Kegstand was

36:52.993 --> 36:55.604
already dead
before I reanimated him.

36:55.648 --> 36:56.910
Okay,

36:56.953 --> 36:58.912
so why not bring back Dustin
or Matthew

36:58.955 --> 37:01.219
and just talk to them?Because humans require

37:01.262 --> 37:04.352
far more energy
than small creatures.

37:04.396 --> 37:06.746
Far more than I have.

37:07.790 --> 37:10.271
Wait.

37:10.315 --> 37:13.274
Is that why you've
been spending time with me?

37:13.318 --> 37:15.668
T-To use my energy?

37:15.711 --> 37:18.192
Bess.

37:21.151 --> 37:23.066
I'm teaching you,

37:23.110 --> 37:27.506
because I truly do believe that
you are destined for greatness.

37:28.550 --> 37:32.250
But if you're uncomfortable,
we can stop.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.080
No.

37:37.124 --> 37:39.518
I want to keep growing.

37:39.561 --> 37:42.042
I need to protect my friends.

37:42.085 --> 37:44.262
Then you will.

37:50.572 --> 37:53.009
Thanks for your hospitality,
man.

37:53.053 --> 37:54.968
Oh, not a problem.

37:55.011 --> 37:57.753
Let me at least cover
some groceries.

37:57.797 --> 37:59.538
[phone vibrates]

38:02.367 --> 38:04.934
Thank you. You didn't have to.

38:07.807 --> 38:11.637
Hey, Ace, um...

38:13.726 --> 38:16.555
I'm sorry about what happened
with your parents.

38:16.598 --> 38:17.817
Thanks.

38:17.860 --> 38:19.471
I'll figure it out,
though.

38:21.429 --> 38:23.388
[sighs]:
Roomies. That's interesting.

38:23.431 --> 38:25.259
Just for now, though,
until, you know,

38:25.303 --> 38:27.522
I get a second job,
and then I'll...

38:27.566 --> 38:29.611
find my own place.That's okay.

38:29.655 --> 38:31.657
Nick filled me in.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.659
Donations for the youth center.

38:33.702 --> 38:35.487
Oh, outstanding!

38:35.530 --> 38:36.923
Mm-hmm.

38:36.966 --> 38:40.448
You please tell your dentist
I said thank you?

38:40.492 --> 38:41.797
[laughs]

38:41.841 --> 38:43.495
Mwah!Yeah.

38:44.539 --> 38:47.107
He's actually, um...

38:47.150 --> 38:50.066
he's actually not my dentist.

38:50.110 --> 38:52.112
Um...

38:52.155 --> 38:54.157
he's my biological father.

38:55.202 --> 38:57.378
I finally went
to meet him today.

39:02.992 --> 39:05.995
Wh-Why, um...

39:06.039 --> 39:08.694
why did you hide that
from me?

39:08.737 --> 39:10.348
Hide?

39:11.392 --> 39:13.176
Nick, it was my thing to handle.

39:13.220 --> 39:14.961
We're engaged
to be married.

39:15.004 --> 39:17.616
Aren't we supposed to...
handle things together?

39:17.659 --> 39:20.140
I mean, you could have told me
you were going to see your dad.

39:20.183 --> 39:22.272
GEORGE:I wasn't ready to
tell you, okay?

39:22.316 --> 39:24.884
I didn't want you to
try to talk me out of
it or have an opinion

39:24.927 --> 39:26.407
on what I was doing.Oh, oh,

39:26.451 --> 39:28.496
so-so now you don't want me
having an opinion.

39:28.540 --> 39:31.107
No. Nick, you are completely
taking this the wrong way.

39:31.151 --> 39:33.893
Look, today I faced down someone
that I have been avoiding

39:33.936 --> 39:35.373
my whole life,

39:35.416 --> 39:38.027
and it made me remember
that I am fiery and indomitable.

39:38.071 --> 39:40.073
And on top of that,
it made me realize

39:40.116 --> 39:42.858
that I don't want to give up
on my future.That's great,

39:42.902 --> 39:44.425
and I'm happy to hear it.

39:44.469 --> 39:47.036
But I wish you'd have trusted me
with all that beforehand.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.777
It's not about
whether I trust you.

39:48.821 --> 39:50.997
Oh, then what is it about?

39:51.040 --> 39:52.999
Because this is
a pattern with you--

39:53.042 --> 39:54.609
keeping secrets from me.

39:54.653 --> 39:56.176
Just...

39:56.219 --> 39:58.439
just please help me understand.

39:58.483 --> 40:00.310
What is there
to understand?

40:00.354 --> 40:02.530
Not everyone wants to talk about
their feelings all the time!

40:02.574 --> 40:03.749
How about that?

40:03.792 --> 40:05.011
Well, hello.
Oh, yay,

40:05.054 --> 40:07.056
I'm not the last one
to this team meeting.

40:07.100 --> 40:09.407
Where are you go...Just got to,
uh-- recycling.

40:13.193 --> 40:14.412
Oh.

40:14.455 --> 40:16.892
Oh, yeah, okay,
I'm gonna just sneak by.

40:16.936 --> 40:18.546
Sorry. Carry on.

40:19.808 --> 40:21.506
Happy?

40:21.549 --> 40:23.290
We talked.

40:24.334 --> 40:25.466
Hi.

40:25.510 --> 40:27.076
Hey.

40:27.120 --> 40:29.688
I'm really sorry I
couldn't help you earlier.

40:29.731 --> 40:32.125
You had plenty
to deal with already.

40:32.168 --> 40:34.170
How'd it go?

40:34.214 --> 40:35.998
Trott had a stroke,

40:36.042 --> 40:38.305
and it might have been my fault.

40:39.349 --> 40:40.655
Nancy, I highly doubt that.

40:40.699 --> 40:41.917
I mean, in fairness,

40:41.961 --> 40:44.311
I think it was Temperance
that caused it,

40:44.354 --> 40:48.141
but I was the one who brought
her there to see him, so...

40:48.184 --> 40:50.883
You were just doing
what you thought was best.

40:51.884 --> 40:53.494
At least, um,

40:53.538 --> 40:55.235
I found out that

40:55.278 --> 40:56.454
the other Frozen Hearts Killer

40:56.497 --> 40:58.020
is a supernatural
entity.
[gasps]

40:58.064 --> 41:01.328
Ah! I knew Temperance's ritual
would work!

41:01.371 --> 41:04.505
Wait, I thought
that you were anti-her.

41:04.549 --> 41:07.203
Eh. I had to improvise.

41:07.247 --> 41:09.423
Temperance showed me
a formative moment

41:09.467 --> 41:11.512
from Trott's childhood.

41:11.556 --> 41:15.298
He found the same entity
that attacked me in Icarus Hall.

41:15.342 --> 41:17.300
It was being kept
in a prison, underground,

41:17.344 --> 41:19.868
where it would freeze
the hearts of small creatures.

41:19.912 --> 41:23.829
Apparently,
he was inspired by its power.

41:23.872 --> 41:25.831
It didn't seem like
he was working for it

41:25.874 --> 41:27.485
or bringing it offerings,

41:27.528 --> 41:29.399
and he said
that he didn't free it.

41:29.443 --> 41:30.966
ACE:
But it's out
in the world, so...

41:31.010 --> 41:32.533
somebody did.

41:32.577 --> 41:34.013
BESS:
Unless it
broke free itself

41:34.056 --> 41:35.449
and ran wild.

41:35.493 --> 41:36.842
NANCY:
Either way,

41:36.885 --> 41:38.583
we need to find
the entity's origin,

41:38.626 --> 41:40.454
which means
we need to find its lair.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.761
Huh. Solid plan.

41:42.804 --> 41:45.024
What could possibly
go wrong?
