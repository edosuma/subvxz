WEBVTT

00:08.051 --> 00:09.226
Got a minute?

00:09.270 --> 00:10.662
I know you're aware
that I don't,

00:10.706 --> 00:12.055
since another murder victim
just showed up

00:12.099 --> 00:13.709
with a frozen heart missing
from his chest.

00:13.752 --> 00:15.841
But I am willing to listen
to your questions and thoughts,

00:15.885 --> 00:18.018
so next time please just start
with those to be efficient.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.323
That was a lot of words

00:19.367 --> 00:20.759
for someone trying
to be efficient.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.370
Have you talked
to Temperance Hudson

00:22.413 --> 00:23.806
about Jake Cazine's death?

00:23.849 --> 00:25.242
She should be
a person of interest.

00:25.286 --> 00:27.505
She isn't. She has an alibi
for the time of death:

00:27.549 --> 00:29.246
coffee with me this morning.

00:29.290 --> 00:30.421
She ordered a croissant.

00:30.465 --> 00:31.857
Ah, let me guess.

00:31.901 --> 00:33.772
She engineered some
seemingly casual run-in with you

00:33.816 --> 00:35.339
because she needed something.

00:35.383 --> 00:38.038
If by "organized," you mean
she, uh, invited me, well, yes.

00:38.081 --> 00:39.387
We're both new in town.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.215
I was supposed
to have Sunday off. But...

00:41.258 --> 00:42.868
didn't strike me as suspicious.

00:42.912 --> 00:45.219
Why do you suggest her
as a person of interest?

00:45.262 --> 00:46.829
She lives
in a questionable house

00:46.872 --> 00:48.352
where questionable things
have happened.

00:48.396 --> 00:50.180
Okay, by that logic,

00:50.224 --> 00:51.616
I should interview her house.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.096
Appreciate you coming in.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.619
Do you?

00:54.663 --> 00:57.057
I thought
you'd been avoiding me.

00:58.101 --> 01:00.234
Why would I do that?

01:02.366 --> 01:05.152
Sometimes people
feel awkward

01:05.195 --> 01:08.981
when they've narrowly
avoided death together,

01:09.025 --> 01:11.723
especially when they've saved
each other's lives.

01:12.942 --> 01:14.683
I don't feel awkward.

01:14.726 --> 01:17.512
It is good to see you.

01:17.555 --> 01:19.818
Unfortunately, I am busy.

01:19.862 --> 01:22.908
Trying to catch
the other Frozen Hearts Killer.

01:22.952 --> 01:24.171
So, it looks like a copycat.

01:24.214 --> 01:25.998
What was Trott's reaction

01:26.042 --> 01:27.522
when you told him
about Jake's murder?

01:27.565 --> 01:29.480
Trott lawyered up.
He's not talking.

01:29.524 --> 01:31.613
Okay, but he told me
before he was arrested

01:31.656 --> 01:34.224
that he was a part
of something much bigger.[phone vibrating]

01:34.268 --> 01:37.140

01:44.191 --> 01:46.802
D.A.'s dropping all charges
against Trott.

01:46.845 --> 01:47.846
What?!

01:47.890 --> 01:49.413
Because of Jake Cazine?

01:49.457 --> 01:51.198
She thinks the fact
that Jake was killed

01:51.241 --> 01:52.416
while Trott was in custody
introduces

01:52.460 --> 01:54.157
too much reasonable doubt,
and a jury

01:54.201 --> 01:56.246
will never convict him
of last week's murders.

01:56.290 --> 01:58.248
But I found evidence
in his house.

01:58.292 --> 02:00.555
And-and-and what
about the murder in Alaska?

02:00.598 --> 02:02.339
Alaska's
not my case,

02:02.383 --> 02:04.167
and the evidence from the house
is inadmissible.

Ready or not,
you're going to.

02:37.418 --> 02:39.376
This is my client Asher Davies.

02:39.420 --> 02:40.812
Have you seen him?

02:41.857 --> 02:43.163
No.

02:44.251 --> 02:46.601
He was supposed
to be cooperating with the D.A.

02:46.644 --> 02:48.037
in an investigation.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.082
Three nights ago,
he walked into a cannery

02:50.126 --> 02:51.649
and never came out.

02:51.693 --> 02:54.304
The same night,
you picked up Bertram Bobbsey

02:57.786 --> 02:59.570
What happened in there?

I don't know.

03:02.007 --> 03:04.140
When Mr. Bobbsey
got back in my car,

03:04.184 --> 03:06.360
he had blood on
his knuckles.

03:06.403 --> 03:10.277
So I made him get out, and I
haven't heard from him since.

03:10.320 --> 03:13.280
I had nothing to do with
whatever happened in there.

03:13.323 --> 03:14.933
Except you did.

03:14.977 --> 03:17.284
From this, an argument
can still be made

03:17.327 --> 03:20.025
that you are connected
to whatever happened.

03:20.069 --> 03:23.420
If Bobbsey assaulted Asher,
you will be charged

03:23.464 --> 03:25.683
as an accessory
after the fact.

03:28.599 --> 03:31.341
I want to hire you
as my lawyer.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.083
I can't represent you,

If I get my dad involved,

03:44.267 --> 03:46.226
he might end up
arresting me himself.

I wish I could, but I got
to deal with this other thing.

09:24.694 --> 09:26.696
Just, uh,
be careful

09:26.740 --> 09:28.655
around your mystical relatives.Aw,

09:28.698 --> 09:30.700
what's she gonna do,
bathe in my blood again?

09:33.398 --> 09:34.443
I'll be fine.

09:39.622 --> 09:41.406
EDWIN: Sorry I don't have
any snacks to offer.

09:41.450 --> 09:44.061
I thought about putting in
a vending machine at one point,

09:44.105 --> 09:46.107
but it seemed
self-serving.

09:46.150 --> 09:49.632
Candy equals cavities
equals business.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.634
I try to keep
a good word of mouth

09:51.678 --> 09:54.115
around here, you know?

09:54.158 --> 09:55.551
Yeah.

09:57.335 --> 09:59.903
I-Is that
how you found me?

09:59.947 --> 10:03.254
My... dentistry practice?

10:04.299 --> 10:05.735
I've always known
where you were.

10:05.779 --> 10:08.738
And I know you live by yourself.

10:08.782 --> 10:11.436
Wasn't that hard to keep track
of someone named Chen,

10:11.480 --> 10:13.743
especially someone
whose middle name I inherited.

10:15.789 --> 10:18.661
[exhales]
What else did your mother
tell you about me?

10:18.705 --> 10:20.707
She said
that you...

10:20.750 --> 10:24.798
had an epic teen romance...
that ended

10:24.841 --> 10:28.279
about ten months after you
got her pregnant with me.

10:29.716 --> 10:32.588
After which
we never saw you again.

10:32.632 --> 10:36.853
So I was surprised when I
got your friend request.

10:38.855 --> 10:40.683
If you found out
that I'm getting married

10:40.727 --> 10:42.511
and you expect
to walk me down the aisle,

10:42.554 --> 10:44.774
let me just tell you...I'm not expecting
anything.

10:44.818 --> 10:47.081
I friend-buttoned you

10:47.124 --> 10:48.517
because I recently
read something...

10:48.560 --> 10:49.736
"Friend-buttoned" me?

10:49.779 --> 10:51.738
[knocking]Okay, look...

10:51.781 --> 10:52.913
[knocking continues]

10:52.956 --> 10:55.089
I-I should...
I should probably get that.

10:55.132 --> 10:57.091
[pounding]Yeah.

10:57.134 --> 10:58.309
[sighs]

11:00.398 --> 11:01.748
[door opens]

11:01.791 --> 11:03.924
Dr. Chen,
I-I know this is your day off,

11:03.967 --> 11:06.013
but Jonah,
he was riding his bike too fast,

11:06.056 --> 11:07.623
there was this pothole...

11:07.667 --> 11:09.146
JONAH [sobbing]:
It went too fast.

11:09.190 --> 11:10.408
It's not my fault.

11:10.452 --> 11:12.410
EDWIN:Okay, okay.
Hey, can I...

11:12.454 --> 11:14.412
can I take a look,
and let's see what...

11:14.456 --> 11:15.762
Yeah. Okay.

11:15.805 --> 11:17.415
All right,
come on in.

11:17.459 --> 11:18.590
Come on in.

11:21.245 --> 11:23.639
Oh, there's someone
ahead of us.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.817
I can wait.

11:28.905 --> 11:31.647
Okay, let's go take a seat
on the chair, okay?

11:32.648 --> 11:33.823
All right, Jonah...

11:33.867 --> 11:36.391
[phone vibrating]

11:41.570 --> 11:43.703
Hey, it's George.
Leave a short message.

11:43.746 --> 11:44.747
[beep]

11:44.791 --> 11:45.966
[door opens, bell jingles]

11:47.010 --> 11:48.316
Oh.

11:48.359 --> 11:49.752
Hey.

11:49.796 --> 11:52.929
Welcome to The Claw.

11:52.973 --> 11:54.365
Uh, coffee?

11:57.412 --> 11:59.675
Oh, uh, he called in sick.

12:03.635 --> 12:06.813
Hmm. Well, uh,
maybe he's at,

12:06.856 --> 12:10.033
uh, Fred's Towing.

12:18.128 --> 12:19.347
Strange?

12:19.390 --> 12:21.001
I... I don't understand.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.006
Oh.

12:26.049 --> 12:27.268
Can I help?

12:27.311 --> 12:30.227
I could go with you
to Fred's Towing.

12:37.539 --> 12:39.497
Um, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.673
I have, uh, I have time.

12:43.414 --> 12:45.286
So much time.

12:46.374 --> 12:49.638
TEMPERANCE:
I'm always happy to help family.

12:49.681 --> 12:53.250
And my most
promising pupil.

12:53.294 --> 12:55.818
I didn't expect you
to say yes.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.603
Why? She helped you
with the hat guy-thing.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.479
And I care about

13:04.522 --> 13:07.090
the well-being of this town.

13:07.134 --> 13:09.527
So, how can I help?

13:09.571 --> 13:12.617
Well, there is a connection

13:12.661 --> 13:15.359
between Trott and whoever
killed Jake Cazine.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.100
Trott told me he's a part
of something much bigger,

13:17.144 --> 13:18.623
and I need to know
what he means by that.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.974
I'm trying to make sure that
he doesn't get out of custody

13:21.017 --> 13:22.889
because of some
arbitrary loophole.

13:22.932 --> 13:26.370
Let a murderer go.
How infuriating.

13:26.414 --> 13:27.850
Nancy feels the same way.

13:27.894 --> 13:30.679
I just was hoping that there's
some sort of ritual

13:30.722 --> 13:32.637
that could help me see
the bigger picture,

13:32.681 --> 13:33.638
like a bird's-eye view.

13:33.682 --> 13:36.859
I could attempt
a modification

13:36.903 --> 13:38.992
to the Memory Weave ritual

13:39.035 --> 13:43.779
to see which memory had the most
emotional significance,

13:43.823 --> 13:47.565
if you can get us access
to Trott in his cell.

13:47.609 --> 13:49.829
That is a tall order,

13:49.872 --> 13:52.309
but those are
Nancy's specialties.

13:52.353 --> 13:55.051
Makes her a great
detective and waitress.

13:55.095 --> 13:57.445
It might be doable. The
station's stretched pretty thin,

13:57.488 --> 13:59.490
but w-we would have
to get past Agent Park.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.144
[phone chimes]TEMPERANCE: Hi, Nelson.

14:01.188 --> 14:03.668
I believe the other killer
broke into my home

14:03.712 --> 14:05.235
the day of the first murders.

14:05.279 --> 14:07.977
If you could please meet me
at Icarus Hall

14:08.021 --> 14:11.720
to look for clues they
might have left behind.

14:11.763 --> 14:12.852
Sent.

14:12.895 --> 14:15.942
He is definitely
not gonna buy that.

14:15.985 --> 14:17.726
[phone whooshes]Oh.

14:17.769 --> 14:19.989
He just did.

14:20.033 --> 14:23.471
And he's on his way
to Icarus Hall.

14:23.514 --> 14:27.344
Bess, perhaps you could
intercept him when he arrives.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.216
Absolutely.
Count me in.

14:29.259 --> 14:30.957
NANCY:
Looks like we have
maybe three hours

14:31.000 --> 14:33.742
to get in, get info, get out
and not get caught.

14:33.785 --> 14:35.265
Great.

14:35.309 --> 14:37.877
Team NaTempEss...Oh.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.879
...assemble.

14:45.319 --> 14:47.930
You were smart to save the
chipped piece when you found it.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.758
This guy's good in a crisis.

14:49.801 --> 14:52.587
You're doing good, buddy.No wonder you took a tumble.

14:52.630 --> 14:54.806
[phone vibrating]The potholes around here
are like asteroid craters.

14:54.850 --> 14:57.984
Hey. Uh, I was gonna
call you back. Sorry.

14:58.027 --> 14:59.202
NICK:
I was just checking in.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.204
I'm helping Ace's dad
with something,

15:01.248 --> 15:03.163
so Jesse's covering at The Claw.

15:03.206 --> 15:05.556
Cool. I'm still stuck
at the dentist.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.036
Oh, dentist.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.690
I didn't know
you had an appointment.Yeah.

15:08.733 --> 15:10.779
Just... just a little plaque.

15:10.822 --> 15:13.390
Oh, no, no, no, I didn't mean
your teeth, I just...

15:13.434 --> 15:18.047
It's just, um, this morning
before you left,

15:18.091 --> 15:19.353
it seemed like

15:19.396 --> 15:21.007
you had something
on your mind.

15:21.050 --> 15:23.966
Yeah, well, a ten-year life
expectancy will do that to you.

15:24.010 --> 15:26.447
Listen, if it stresses you out
to think about it, then...

15:26.490 --> 15:27.752
I'm not stressed out, okay?

15:27.796 --> 15:29.711
I'm watching this guy work,
and I'm jealous.

15:29.754 --> 15:31.147
EDWIN:
So good.

15:31.191 --> 15:32.975
I wish that I had a dentist
like this growing up.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.846
Oh.

15:34.890 --> 15:37.153
It just feels like everyone gets
to have these dentists

15:37.197 --> 15:39.329
who are, like, you know,
they care about how you feel

15:39.373 --> 15:41.505
and they hold your hand
when you're scared, or...

15:41.549 --> 15:43.246
they're, like, protective
and reliable

15:43.290 --> 15:46.075
and-and psyched
to be your da-- dentist.

15:46.119 --> 15:48.556
All right, I got to go.
I'll be back soon.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.253
All right...[line clicks]

15:58.261 --> 16:01.525
Uh, yeah, yeah.

16:01.569 --> 16:04.441
Uh, my fiancé is
at the dentist.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.404
[engine stalls]

16:11.796 --> 16:15.017
So, when you said

16:15.061 --> 16:18.020
"visit" Fred's Towing,

16:18.064 --> 16:21.937
you meant "stake out"
Fred's Towing.

16:26.855 --> 16:29.075
Ah. True.

16:34.602 --> 16:36.996
Still no text from Ace.

16:47.745 --> 16:51.271
Oh, uh, it's great.

16:51.314 --> 16:52.794
It's great, yeah.

16:52.837 --> 16:55.753
I mean, honestly,
I never thought

16:55.797 --> 17:00.019
I'd be married,
um, so young.

17:06.112 --> 17:09.071
Yeah, yeah.

17:09.115 --> 17:12.944
I mean, George is unique.
[chuckles]

17:12.988 --> 17:15.686
Can I ask?

17:15.730 --> 17:19.168
How did you know

17:19.212 --> 17:22.215
your wife was the one?

17:22.258 --> 17:24.913
I mean, what-what made you

17:24.956 --> 17:27.611
decide to propose?

17:57.337 --> 17:59.121
Temperance should be back
any moment.

17:59.165 --> 18:01.297
Oh, no, that's okay,
thank you.

18:01.341 --> 18:03.952
I'm gonna call Temperance,
we'll reschedule and, uh,

18:03.995 --> 18:05.171
we'll get some techs out here
and examine

18:05.214 --> 18:07.129
exactly where
the home invasion happened.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.652
Appreciate you
showing me around, though.

18:08.696 --> 18:10.393
But the killer is
still out there, right?

18:10.437 --> 18:12.874
Could you maybe stay
until Temperance returns?

18:12.917 --> 18:14.832
I'm-I'm really frightened.

18:14.876 --> 18:17.139
Yeah, if you're not
comfortable here,

18:17.183 --> 18:18.488
I can give you a ride
back to town.

18:18.532 --> 18:21.404
No, you see, I said
to Temperance that we'd wait.

18:21.448 --> 18:25.539
Please... take a seat.

18:25.582 --> 18:26.931
[cat mewls]Ooh!

18:26.975 --> 18:28.890
What was that?

18:28.933 --> 18:30.631
[cat growling]Ah... [chuckles]

18:38.334 --> 18:42.164
There's my handsome mister.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.861
Goochie-goo.
[chuckles]

18:43.905 --> 18:46.212
With all the killings
going on,

18:46.255 --> 18:48.083
we've been staying
with Temperance.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.432
So I'm just gonna
put him in another room

18:49.476 --> 18:51.260
so he can be comfier.

18:51.304 --> 18:52.783
[cat screeching][screams]

18:53.697 --> 18:56.483
It's okay, it's just me.

18:56.526 --> 19:00.182
[screams, gasps]

19:03.229 --> 19:06.014
Wait, wait, wait.

19:08.234 --> 19:11.062
I'm afraid your cat
is no longer alive.

19:11.106 --> 19:13.456
Thank God.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.764
For granting him peace.

19:16.807 --> 19:18.548
[chuckles]

19:18.592 --> 19:21.812
He's just been so very ill.

19:21.856 --> 19:25.468
Do you, um...

19:25.512 --> 19:26.904
think you could
help me bury him?

19:26.948 --> 19:29.211
Please. I-I just bought him

19:29.255 --> 19:31.822
a little bowtie that's still
on its way from Etsy.

19:31.866 --> 19:34.260
[sobs]
Please don't cry.

19:34.303 --> 19:37.611
I'll help you bury your cat.

19:37.654 --> 19:39.656
Thank you.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.136
I'll get a shovel.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.225
[sighs]

19:45.227 --> 19:46.620
Dad, if you're calling me
'cause you're using

19:46.663 --> 19:48.230
the tracking app
on my phone again,

19:48.274 --> 19:51.190
I am at the police station
on community liaison business.

19:51.233 --> 19:52.756
I'm calling because
I still haven't

19:52.800 --> 19:54.584
heard from Ace,
and his father and I

19:54.628 --> 19:55.585
are starting to get
really worried.

19:55.629 --> 19:56.586
He didn't call you?

19:56.630 --> 19:58.719
He stopped by work today.

19:58.762 --> 20:01.200
He-he mentioned something
about a crossword cipher.

20:01.243 --> 20:02.723
Have you solved it yet?

20:02.766 --> 20:04.246
ACE:
Can you help me solve a cipher?

20:04.290 --> 20:06.030
I need to figure out what
the message is in this thing.

20:06.074 --> 20:08.381
No, but I can now.

20:08.424 --> 20:09.643
Why are you worried about Ace?

20:09.686 --> 20:10.948
He's in way over his head

20:10.992 --> 20:12.950
with Bertram Bobbsey.

20:12.994 --> 20:14.691
The cipher might tell us
where he's headed.

20:17.128 --> 20:18.739
Thank you.

20:18.782 --> 20:22.569
[muttering]:
Two across. "Ten out of ten."

20:22.612 --> 20:24.875
Okay, the first...

20:24.919 --> 20:27.965
the first letter of each word?
No, last letter? No.

20:28.009 --> 20:30.751
First letter
in reverse order...

20:33.623 --> 20:35.364
Mm.

20:35.408 --> 20:37.105
550 Bay View.

20:37.148 --> 20:38.802
8:00 p.m. Sunday.

20:38.846 --> 20:41.718
That's tonight.I don't know how
he'll get there.

20:41.762 --> 20:43.503
Thom said Ace's car
is still in the shop.

20:43.546 --> 20:45.287
Then look for Ryan's car.

20:45.331 --> 20:47.811
Why would Ryan loan out his car?

20:47.855 --> 20:48.943
Well, he wouldn't
just loan it out,

20:48.986 --> 20:50.466
but he'd barter it
for something.

20:50.510 --> 20:53.295
Haven't you noticed our
sparkling clean dishes

20:53.339 --> 20:54.949
organized by size?

20:54.992 --> 20:58.735
It's the same way
Ace does it at The Claw.

34:30.111 --> 34:32.766
I wanted to help Amanda, okay?

34:32.809 --> 34:35.377
At first I was just
giving Bobbsey rides.

34:37.162 --> 34:39.555
I guess I learned it from you.

34:39.599 --> 34:41.340
When not sure, keep it secret.

34:44.778 --> 34:47.607
You won't talk about
what's going on with you.

34:47.650 --> 34:50.349
You won't... you
won't talk about,

34:50.392 --> 34:51.524
about your life from before,

34:51.567 --> 34:53.308
when you were a U.S. Marshal.

34:56.224 --> 34:58.139
Yeah, but if you were just
honest with me to begin with,

34:58.183 --> 35:00.315
I wouldn't have gone searching
for your secret son.

35:00.359 --> 35:01.360
REBECCA:
Ace?

35:05.190 --> 35:08.236
What do you mean,
"secret son"?

35:10.891 --> 35:12.893
Mom, what are you doing here?

35:13.937 --> 35:15.852
I was closing up
the library,

35:15.896 --> 35:20.030
and the police said
we had to wait inside.

35:20.074 --> 35:23.643
They just opened the doors.

35:23.686 --> 35:27.125
Why did he say
you have a "secret son"?

35:31.129 --> 35:32.565
What is he not
supposed to say?

35:34.219 --> 35:35.655
Obviously there is.

35:38.919 --> 35:40.268
Don't blame this on me.

35:40.312 --> 35:41.443
Ace is right.

35:41.487 --> 35:42.618
You're deflecting.

35:47.536 --> 35:49.190
No, I'm not a child.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.201
Please calm down.

36:00.245 --> 36:02.334
Just calm down!Mom,

36:02.377 --> 36:03.683
I'm sorry,
nobody wanted you

36:03.726 --> 36:05.467
to find out this way, but you...

36:05.511 --> 36:07.077
Stop talking!

36:07.121 --> 36:09.297
I want you gone!

36:09.341 --> 36:11.343
Tonight!

36:16.261 --> 36:17.958
[shudders]

36:18.001 --> 36:19.916
Oh...

36:31.319 --> 36:34.192
You know, I just
buried a revenant cat.

36:34.235 --> 36:37.412
Kegstand went missing after
Trott killed his owner Dustin,

36:37.456 --> 36:38.718
and Agent Park

36:38.761 --> 36:40.763
very nearly spotted
his name tag.

36:40.807 --> 36:43.375
So why was Kegstand here?He was a witness

36:43.418 --> 36:45.028
to Dustin's murder.

36:45.072 --> 36:47.030
I needed him for a ritual
to learn more

36:47.074 --> 36:49.163
about the killers
terrorizing Horseshoe Bay.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.338
So you...

36:50.382 --> 36:52.949
killed Kegstand?Kegstand was

36:52.993 --> 36:55.604
already dead
before I reanimated him.

36:55.648 --> 36:56.910
Okay,

36:56.953 --> 36:58.912
so why not bring back Dustin
or Matthew

36:58.955 --> 37:01.219
and just talk to them?Because humans require

37:01.262 --> 37:04.352
far more energy
than small creatures.

37:04.396 --> 37:06.746
Far more than I have.

37:07.790 --> 37:10.271
Wait.

37:10.315 --> 37:13.274
Is that why you've
been spending time with me?

37:13.318 --> 37:15.668
T-To use my energy?

37:15.711 --> 37:18.192
Bess.

37:21.151 --> 37:23.066
I'm teaching you,

37:23.110 --> 37:27.506
because I truly do believe that
you are destined for greatness.

37:28.550 --> 37:32.250
But if you're uncomfortable,
we can stop.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.080
No.

37:37.124 --> 37:39.518
I want to keep growing.

37:39.561 --> 37:42.042
I need to protect my friends.

37:42.085 --> 37:44.262
Then you will.

37:50.572 --> 37:53.009
Thanks for your hospitality,
man.

37:53.053 --> 37:54.968
Oh, not a problem.

37:55.011 --> 37:57.753
Let me at least cover
some groceries.

37:57.797 --> 37:59.538
[phone vibrates]

38:02.367 --> 38:04.934
Thank you. You didn't have to.

38:07.807 --> 38:11.637
Hey, Ace, um...

38:13.726 --> 38:16.555
I'm sorry about what happened
with your parents.

38:16.598 --> 38:17.817
Thanks.

38:17.860 --> 38:19.471
I'll figure it out,
though.

38:21.429 --> 38:23.388
[sighs]:
Roomies. That's interesting.

38:23.431 --> 38:25.259
Just for now, though,
until, you know,

38:25.303 --> 38:27.522
I get a second job,
and then I'll...

38:27.566 --> 38:29.611
find my own place.That's okay.

38:29.655 --> 38:31.657
Nick filled me in.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.659
Donations for the youth center.

38:33.702 --> 38:35.487
Oh, outstanding!

38:35.530 --> 38:36.923
Mm-hmm.

38:36.966 --> 38:40.448
You please tell your dentist
I said thank you?

38:40.492 --> 38:41.797
[laughs]

38:41.841 --> 38:43.495
Mwah!Yeah.

38:44.539 --> 38:47.107
He's actually, um...

38:47.150 --> 38:50.066
he's actually not my dentist.

38:50.110 --> 38:52.112
Um...

38:52.155 --> 38:54.157
he's my biological father.

38:55.202 --> 38:57.378
I finally went
to meet him today.

39:02.992 --> 39:05.995
Wh-Why, um...

39:06.039 --> 39:08.694
why did you hide that
from me?

39:08.737 --> 39:10.348
Hide?

39:11.392 --> 39:13.176
Nick, it was my thing to handle.

39:13.220 --> 39:14.961
We're engaged
to be married.

39:15.004 --> 39:17.616
Aren't we supposed to...
handle things together?

39:17.659 --> 39:20.140
I mean, you could have told me
you were going to see your dad.

39:20.183 --> 39:22.272
GEORGE:I wasn't ready to
tell you, okay?

39:22.316 --> 39:24.884
I didn't want you to
try to talk me out of
it or have an opinion

39:24.927 --> 39:26.407
on what I was doing.Oh, oh,

39:26.451 --> 39:28.496
so-so now you don't want me
having an opinion.

39:28.540 --> 39:31.107
No. Nick, you are completely
taking this the wrong way.

39:31.151 --> 39:33.893
Look, today I faced down someone
that I have been avoiding

39:33.936 --> 39:35.373
my whole life,

39:35.416 --> 39:38.027
and it made me remember
that I am fiery and indomitable.

39:38.071 --> 39:40.073
And on top of that,
it made me realize

39:40.116 --> 39:42.858
that I don't want to give up
on my future.That's great,

39:42.902 --> 39:44.425
and I'm happy to hear it.

39:44.469 --> 39:47.036
But I wish you'd have trusted me
with all that beforehand.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.777
It's not about
whether I trust you.

39:48.821 --> 39:50.997
Oh, then what is it about?

39:51.040 --> 39:52.999
Because this is
a pattern with you--

39:53.042 --> 39:54.609
keeping secrets from me.

39:54.653 --> 39:56.176
Just...

39:56.219 --> 39:58.439
just please help me understand.

39:58.483 --> 40:00.310
What is there
to understand?

40:00.354 --> 40:02.530
Not everyone wants to talk about
their feelings all the time!

40:02.574 --> 40:03.749
How about that?

40:03.792 --> 40:05.011
Well, hello.
Oh, yay,

40:05.054 --> 40:07.056
I'm not the last one
to this team meeting.

40:07.100 --> 40:09.407
Where are you go...Just got to,
uh-- recycling.

40:13.193 --> 40:14.412
Oh.

40:14.455 --> 40:16.892
Oh, yeah, okay,
I'm gonna just sneak by.

40:16.936 --> 40:18.546
Sorry. Carry on.

40:19.808 --> 40:21.506
Happy?

40:21.549 --> 40:23.290
We talked.

40:24.334 --> 40:25.466
Hi.

40:25.510 --> 40:27.076
Hey.

40:27.120 --> 40:29.688
I'm really sorry I
couldn't help you earlier.

40:29.731 --> 40:32.125
You had plenty
to deal with already.

40:32.168 --> 40:34.170
How'd it go?

40:34.214 --> 40:35.998
Trott had a stroke,

40:36.042 --> 40:38.305
and it might have been my fault.

40:39.349 --> 40:40.655
Nancy, I highly doubt that.

40:40.699 --> 40:41.917
I mean, in fairness,

40:41.961 --> 40:44.311
I think it was Temperance
that caused it,

40:44.354 --> 40:48.141
but I was the one who brought
her there to see him, so...

40:48.184 --> 40:50.883
You were just doing
what you thought was best.

40:51.884 --> 40:53.494
At least, um,

40:53.538 --> 40:55.235
I found out that

40:55.278 --> 40:56.454
the other Frozen Hearts Killer

40:56.497 --> 40:58.020
is a supernatural
entity.
[gasps]

40:58.064 --> 41:01.328
Ah! I knew Temperance's ritual
would work!

41:01.371 --> 41:04.505
Wait, I thought
that you were anti-her.

41:04.549 --> 41:07.203
Eh. I had to improvise.

41:07.247 --> 41:09.423
Temperance showed me
a formative moment

41:09.467 --> 41:11.512
from Trott's childhood.

41:11.556 --> 41:15.298
He found the same entity
that attacked me in Icarus Hall.

41:15.342 --> 41:17.300
It was being kept
in a prison, underground,

41:17.344 --> 41:19.868
where it would freeze
the hearts of small creatures.

41:19.912 --> 41:23.829
Apparently,
he was inspired by its power.

41:23.872 --> 41:25.831
It didn't seem like
he was working for it

41:25.874 --> 41:27.485
or bringing it offerings,

41:27.528 --> 41:29.399
and he said
that he didn't free it.

41:29.443 --> 41:30.966
ACE:
But it's out
in the world, so...

41:31.010 --> 41:32.533
somebody did.

41:32.577 --> 41:34.013
BESS:
Unless it
broke free itself

41:34.056 --> 41:35.449
and ran wild.

41:35.493 --> 41:36.842
NANCY:
Either way,

41:36.885 --> 41:38.583
we need to find
the entity's origin,

41:38.626 --> 41:40.454
which means
we need to find its lair.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.761
Huh. Solid plan.

41:42.804 --> 41:45.024
What could possibly
go wrong?
