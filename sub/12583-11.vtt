WEBVTT

00:35.702 --> 00:37.704
-

00:39.539 --> 00:41.666
<i>Buon giorno,</i> what can I get you?

00:42.208 --> 00:46.254
Well, what do you recommend
to a couple of real big spenders?

00:46.337 --> 00:48.256
My boyfriend likes the surf n' turf.

00:49.132 --> 00:51.301
Medium cheese pizza, two waters. Tap.

00:51.634 --> 00:53.386
Thanks for inviting me out, sir.

00:53.470 --> 00:56.014
Yeah, yeah, well,
this ain't a social call, son.

00:56.097 --> 00:59.017
You know the Strickland
Propane Family Fun Day?

00:59.100 --> 01:01.436
The Strickland Propane Family Fun Day?

01:01.519 --> 01:03.104
We haven't done that in five years.

01:03.188 --> 01:04.564
Well, glad you liked it

01:04.647 --> 01:06.900
'cause this party
is what I'm giving everyone

01:06.983 --> 01:08.318
instead of health insurance

01:08.401 --> 01:09.861
so we can't mess it up.

01:09.986 --> 01:12.322
That's why I'm putting you in charge.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.950
I will treat this picnic
with all the gravity

01:16.034 --> 01:18.036
and seriousness it requires.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.040
Good evening and <i>buon giorno.</i>

01:22.123 --> 01:24.918
The live entertainment portion
of our evening is about to begin,

01:25.001 --> 01:25.877
so would you please

01:25.960 --> 01:28.630
give a warm welcome to John Redcorn

01:28.713 --> 01:30.799
and Big Mountain Fudgecake.

01:30.882 --> 01:32.008
John Redcorn?

01:34.886 --> 01:39.265
Maria's Pasta and Pizza,
are you ready to rock?

01:41.059 --> 01:44.604
<i>♪ There's a hole in my pocket
where my money should go ♪</i>

01:44.687 --> 01:47.732


01:47.816 --> 01:51.486
<i>♪ There's a hole in my heart
where you used to go ♪</i>

01:51.569 --> 01:52.987
<i>♪ There's a hole ♪</i>

01:53.071 --> 01:54.572
<i>♪ And a hole ♪</i>

01:55.031 --> 01:57.283
<i>♪ And a hole... ♪</i>

01:57.367 --> 01:59.035
<i>♪ Big ol' hole ♪</i>

02:00.245 --> 02:01.996
Let's get the hell out of here!

02:06.000 --> 02:07.168
So, sir?

02:07.252 --> 02:10.088
What specifically did you have in mind
for this picnic?

02:10.171 --> 02:11.965
Uh-uh! I delegated.

02:12.048 --> 02:14.467
You're the lead monkey
on the back of this ostrich.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.511
So go make me a picnic!

02:16.594 --> 02:17.679
Hank.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.933
Oh, uh, hey, John Redcorn.

02:22.016 --> 02:23.143
You finished already?

02:23.226 --> 02:24.352
We are finished forever.

02:24.435 --> 02:26.980
Got fired from playing for free.

02:27.063 --> 02:29.065
It don't get any lower than that.

02:29.149 --> 02:32.902
That dang manager never got
what Fudgecake is all about.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.737
No one ever does.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.656
We're either ahead of our times

02:36.739 --> 02:38.408
or possibly way behind,

02:38.491 --> 02:40.785
stuck in some more classical time.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.662
But either way, us and our times

02:42.745 --> 02:44.205
aren't seeing eye to eye.

02:45.081 --> 02:49.294
Yeah, well, uh, I'm sure you
and your times will work it out.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.880
I couldn't help overhearing
you have a big event coming up.

02:52.338 --> 02:53.339
Yeah...

02:53.423 --> 02:55.550
And we sure could use a break, Hank.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.010
Well, uh...

02:57.093 --> 02:58.845
Don't you like to rock?

02:59.846 --> 03:01.598
Wow, you're sure giving me

03:01.681 --> 03:03.141
a lot to think about here,

03:03.266 --> 03:06.019
uh, but I got the family waiting at home.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.648
I'll get to work on him.

03:14.527 --> 03:15.403
Dangit!

03:15.486 --> 03:17.822
That is the third piece
of toast you've broken.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.824
And you're always
so careful with your toast.

03:19.908 --> 03:20.992
What's wrong?

03:21.075 --> 03:23.453
Strickland Family Fun Day.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.538
Do you think if I got good enough meats

03:25.622 --> 03:27.123
it would count as entertainment?

03:27.207 --> 03:29.584
You got to have live entertainment, Dad!

03:29.667 --> 03:31.669
Music, magic...

03:31.753 --> 03:33.504
Some people even do both.

03:33.588 --> 03:36.633
Entertainment is the only thing
that distracts people

03:36.716 --> 03:39.344
from realizing how much
they don't like each other.

03:50.271 --> 03:53.566
So what am I gonna be
listening to while I eat this?

03:54.150 --> 03:55.568
I don't know.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.779
Finding a band for under a hundred dollars

03:57.862 --> 03:59.113
is harder than you think.

03:59.197 --> 04:00.114
Hey, Hank!

04:00.198 --> 04:02.200
Uh, the picnic's going great, sir.

04:02.283 --> 04:03.284
Good, good.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.036
'Cause I just got back
from Strickland West,

04:05.119 --> 04:06.496
and they've had a tough year

04:06.579 --> 04:08.373
in terms of general disgruntlement.

04:08.456 --> 04:10.959
Really need this picnic to be fun.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.045
You see what kind of pressure I'm under?

04:14.128 --> 04:17.215
You're like one of them astronauts, honey.

04:17.298 --> 04:18.800
-Hank?
-Uh...

04:18.883 --> 04:20.468
Hey, John Redcorn.

04:24.555 --> 04:26.266
Did you find a band for your picnic?

04:26.349 --> 04:27.392
No, he didn't.

04:27.475 --> 04:30.311
And the poor bastard's
all twisted up over it.

04:31.896 --> 04:33.189
In the animal kingdom,

04:33.273 --> 04:35.942
many animals work together in symbiosis.

04:36.025 --> 04:39.612
The oxpecker bird will eat
the ticks and parasites off a zebra.

04:39.696 --> 04:43.241
You and I can be zebra and oxpecker, too.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.412
But why don't I let
our demo tape do the talking?

04:48.204 --> 04:50.290
<i>♪ I am the reaper ♪</i>

04:50.873 --> 04:54.043

05:16.899 --> 05:19.569
Okay, I'm sorry, John Redcorn.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.654
I'm not hiring you. No way.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.116
I... I see...

05:27.076 --> 05:30.455
You know, you start doing massage
to pay the bills

05:30.538 --> 05:31.497
and you tell yourself,

05:31.581 --> 05:33.624
"Just a few more years of this, Johnny."

05:34.751 --> 05:37.295
And one day you look up, and you're 40.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.921
You're 40, Hank!

05:39.005 --> 05:40.798
Okay, there, John Redcorn,

05:40.882 --> 05:43.259
you, uh, you make some good points.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.889
Look, maybe you should stop
waiting for other people

05:47.972 --> 05:49.474
to make things happen for you.

05:49.932 --> 05:50.933
What does that mean?

05:51.017 --> 05:53.853
Uh, well... maybe what you need to do

05:53.936 --> 05:56.314
is to, uh, bet on yourself.

05:56.397 --> 05:58.775
A lot of really successful people
did that.

05:58.858 --> 05:59.859
Bet on myself?

05:59.942 --> 06:00.777
Sure...

06:00.860 --> 06:02.945
It's your dream, you make it happen.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.530
Bet on yourself.

06:05.323 --> 06:06.366
Wow, Hank.

06:06.449 --> 06:07.950
You are very wise.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.911
Thank you. Thank you.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.209
Dangit, Joe Jack,
that helium is for the picnic.

06:16.292 --> 06:17.627
Sorry, buddy.

06:19.003 --> 06:21.089
The guy asked me
if I wanted honey mustard,

06:21.172 --> 06:22.965
and I almost took a swing at him.

06:23.049 --> 06:26.260
Long story short, I got
a good deal on classic yellow.

06:27.178 --> 06:28.805
The pony guy said what?

06:29.680 --> 06:31.766
What the hell is pony season?

06:32.100 --> 06:33.142
What in the...

06:33.601 --> 06:35.353
Joe Jack, I'm gonna have to call you back.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.279
Hey, John Redcorn, what's going on?

06:45.363 --> 06:47.657
Doing a little improvement on your land?

06:47.740 --> 06:49.575
I'm doing an improvement on my life.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.327
On all of our lives.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.370
You said it.

06:52.453 --> 06:53.955
Isn't it exciting?

06:54.038 --> 06:55.581
I'm following your advice, Hank.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.500
No more relying on other people

06:57.583 --> 06:59.168
to wake up and "get" us.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.921
Now, I'm gonna have a permanent place
to play with my band.

07:02.004 --> 07:04.799
I'm betting on myself
and opening a casino.

07:06.884 --> 07:08.219
But that's crazy.

07:08.302 --> 07:09.387
No, it's brilliant.

07:09.470 --> 07:12.098
Now we have a permanent venue
for Fudgecake to play.

07:12.181 --> 07:14.308
Like Wayne Newton and the Stardust.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.477
You're a genius, Uncle Hank.

07:17.645 --> 07:21.023
<i>♪ There's a hole in my pocket

07:29.115 --> 07:30.575
Oh, God!

07:34.537 --> 07:37.165
So John Redcorn is opening a casino.

07:37.248 --> 07:40.084
I always wanted to see
a white tiger before I died.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.003
I feel like it's my fault.

07:42.086 --> 07:44.380
I'm the one who told him
to bet on himself.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.675
If I wasn't so dang busy
finding entertainment for this picnic,

07:47.758 --> 07:49.510
maybe I could've done something
to stop him.

07:49.594 --> 07:50.595
Relax, Hank.

07:50.678 --> 07:53.181
You know what loosens
the caboose of any party?

07:53.264 --> 07:54.765
Big Mountain Fudgecake!

07:54.849 --> 07:57.143
-Want me to see if they're available?
-No.

07:57.226 --> 08:00.229
They've got a super boffo
Bachman-Turner Overdrive

08:00.313 --> 08:03.774
meets Deep Purple
versus ELO kind of sound.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.109
What are you, their manager?

08:05.193 --> 08:06.068
Yes!

08:06.152 --> 08:08.279
Can you believe the slot was open?

08:08.988 --> 08:10.448
I guess you were wrong, Hank.

08:10.531 --> 08:12.241
Dreams do come true.

08:24.962 --> 08:26.005
Evening, gentlemen.

08:26.088 --> 08:27.548
Where can I find John Redcorn?

08:27.632 --> 08:30.551
Oh, he's the visionary right over there,

08:30.635 --> 08:34.555
the one dripping with sex appeal
and turquoise jewelry.

08:34.639 --> 08:35.973
Hello, brother Indian.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.643
I am Henry Mankiller
with the Tribal Gaming Corporation.

08:38.726 --> 08:39.685
You got my e-mail!

08:39.769 --> 08:41.062
Cool website.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.606
Yes, and I hope you are
enjoying your subscription

08:43.689 --> 08:44.774
to <i>Gaming Nation.</i>

08:44.857 --> 08:47.485
Exactly what kind of Indian are you?

08:47.568 --> 08:49.654
I am 1/64th Creek on my mother's side.

08:49.737 --> 08:50.947
So about your casino.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.448
Actually, it's just temporary.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.659
To get our band going. Let's show him.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.164
<i>♪ Gotta get money ♪</i>

09:00.248 --> 09:03.376

09:17.306 --> 09:19.809
This is where the drum solo usually goes.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.145
Hm. With a sound like that,

09:23.229 --> 09:24.730
you're not gonna need gaming for long.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.148
I completely get that.

09:27.608 --> 09:29.193
But we can accelerate the process.

09:29.277 --> 09:32.029
We are, after all,
in the dream building business.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.282
We got a dream that needs building.

09:34.365 --> 09:37.034
You see, we are one-stop shopping
for everything casino.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.996
We can save you the hassles of dealing

09:40.079 --> 09:42.415
with the white man's loan officers
by financing everything

09:42.498 --> 09:44.625
through our tribal development division.

09:44.709 --> 09:45.793
That means your band

09:45.876 --> 09:48.004
is making gold records that much faster.

09:48.462 --> 09:52.133
This pen has been used
by many of our people

09:52.216 --> 09:53.634
to apply for financing.

10:03.185 --> 10:05.855
Do I look like I know what a JPEG is?

10:05.938 --> 10:08.858
I just want a picture
of a goddang hot dog!

10:08.941 --> 10:11.235
Dad, the news is not good.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.029
Swing band, no.

10:13.112 --> 10:15.573
Fifties tribute band, no.

10:15.656 --> 10:18.242
Even the polka band, no.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.036
Well, there was this one guy.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.330
I think he felt sorry for us.

10:22.413 --> 10:24.040
His name is Bloomers.

10:24.832 --> 10:27.710
He does "imagitainment."

10:30.254 --> 10:31.380
Well, I have a band.

10:34.675 --> 10:36.093
Call Bloomers.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.929
All right. You're almost there.
A little bit more. That's it.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.771
Let's open with <i>I Need Money.</i>

10:46.854 --> 10:49.065
We can transition to <i>Gotta Get Money</i>

10:49.148 --> 10:51.025
and do a whole money medley.

10:51.108 --> 10:53.152
I love that song!

10:53.527 --> 10:55.446
<i>♪ Got to get the money ♪</i>

10:55.529 --> 10:57.782
<i>♪ For the stuff I wanna buy! ♪</i>

10:59.283 --> 11:02.036
We are gonna do some serious rocking.

11:02.119 --> 11:04.914
And then people
are gonna hear us and love us,

11:04.997 --> 11:07.208
and we're gonna be huge.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.001
This is so exciting!

11:09.085 --> 11:09.960
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

11:10.044 --> 11:12.505
I bought a whole bunch
of make-ups for y'all to wear.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.424
Uh, Luanne?

11:15.508 --> 11:18.511
Can I speak to you, outside?

11:22.139 --> 11:23.265
Listen, Yoko.

11:23.349 --> 11:24.850
I'm the manager of this act,

11:24.934 --> 11:27.269
and I'm sick of you trying
to split them apart.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.146
What's a Yoko?

11:29.230 --> 11:30.898
Okay, missy, that's it!

11:30.981 --> 11:33.567
If you ever come within
100 feet of Fudgecake again,

11:33.651 --> 11:37.988
I will spend the rest of my life
making you miserable.

11:38.072 --> 11:39.907
I'm gonna... my purse is inside...

11:39.990 --> 11:40.950
-Get!
-Oh!

11:43.828 --> 11:44.912
Is this fun?

11:44.995 --> 11:47.373
I suggest you book Fudgecake now

11:47.456 --> 11:49.083
because after the casino opens,

11:49.166 --> 11:50.751
they might be too big for you.

11:50.835 --> 11:53.337
They're gonna be helping
kings and dignitaries

11:53.421 --> 11:54.964
get their groove on.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.632
They're not right for us, Dale.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.051
There are gonna be
little kids at this picnic.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.594
And we already hired someone.

12:00.678 --> 12:01.595
Bloomers.

12:01.679 --> 12:04.348
Fine, but can I at least count on you all

12:04.432 --> 12:06.100
to be there tonight for the Fudgecake

12:06.183 --> 12:07.601
when they open the casino?

12:07.685 --> 12:10.229
Well, I do have to be there
to keep an eye on Buck.

12:10.312 --> 12:12.773
He wants to "parlay" the picnic money

12:12.857 --> 12:14.024
on the gaming tables.

12:14.108 --> 12:17.278
Don't be surprised
if Buck forgets all about that

12:17.361 --> 12:20.281
because the power of rockin'
does things to a man.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.407
It's true.

12:21.490 --> 12:24.744
I made a lot of my life decisions
at a Foghat concert.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.078
I stand by them.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.552
This night is full of magic.

12:41.635 --> 12:44.346
Which one of these tables
looks lucky to you, ol' top?

12:44.430 --> 12:45.848
Well, I'm not sure,

12:45.931 --> 12:48.267
but why don't I hold on
to the picnic funds

12:48.350 --> 12:50.394
so you have more room for your winnings?

12:50.478 --> 12:52.062
Ooh, what about that one? What about...

12:52.146 --> 12:54.315
Hold on, I gotta rub
that waiter's head for luck.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.484
Hank, thank you.

12:56.567 --> 12:58.986
None of this would have been possible
without your advice.

12:59.069 --> 13:00.571
Yeah, that's okay.

13:00.654 --> 13:02.948
I don't really want
to take credit for any of this,

13:03.032 --> 13:05.743
but, uh, you're welcome, I guess.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.000
Hugged by an Indian!

13:13.083 --> 13:14.919
We're winning big tonight!

13:16.086 --> 13:18.714
Everybody, put your hands together

13:18.798 --> 13:22.343
for Big... Mountain... Fudgecake!

13:23.844 --> 13:25.596
-Whoo!
-Whoo-hoo!

13:25.679 --> 13:27.014
-Yeah!
-Thank you, Arlen!

13:27.097 --> 13:29.016
And now, here's a song about a band.

13:29.099 --> 13:31.644
A band that no one gave much
of a chance to

13:31.727 --> 13:34.271
until one day that band showed everyone

13:34.355 --> 13:35.815
that they could rock!

13:35.898 --> 13:36.774
A one

13:36.857 --> 13:38.108
and a two and a...

13:38.192 --> 13:40.027
Freeze. Police.

13:41.570 --> 13:43.447
All right, folks, it's over.

13:44.865 --> 13:47.785
Okay, everyone, let's have
a nice orderly egress.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.205
Is this some kind of joke?

13:51.288 --> 13:52.665
We're shutting you down, sir.

13:52.748 --> 13:54.500
This is an illegal gaming establishment.

13:54.583 --> 13:55.793
But we're on Indian land.

13:55.876 --> 13:58.045
Look at me. Look at all the headdresses.

13:58.128 --> 14:00.297
Yes, sir, and that land is in Texas

14:00.381 --> 14:02.132
where there is no Indian gaming.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.551
No Indian gaming?

14:03.634 --> 14:07.179
Didn't you wonder why there weren't
any other Indian casinos in Texas?

14:07.263 --> 14:09.181
I thought it would work to our advantage.

14:13.060 --> 14:15.771
They're wheeling away our shot at glory,

14:15.855 --> 14:18.774
just like they're wheeling
away them shiny machines.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.735
Fudgecake's in a bad, bad way.

14:30.786 --> 14:31.871
But this is my land.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.497
My one chance to be heard.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.374
I've already spent
all the money I borrowed.

14:35.624 --> 14:36.834
How can this be happening?

14:36.917 --> 14:39.378
Texas tribes traded their
federal gaming rights

14:39.503 --> 14:41.297
for state recognition of their tribes.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.799
Now, you can let the folks
play for trinkets

14:43.883 --> 14:45.968
and combs and whatnot, but not for money.

14:46.051 --> 14:47.720
But that's incredibly lame.

14:47.803 --> 14:49.555
Well, yes... but legal.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.857
Hot damn. That's blackjack!

14:59.940 --> 15:01.275
Congratulations, sir.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.318
Very lucky.

15:02.401 --> 15:04.403
Blackjack pays... a stuffed lion.

15:04.486 --> 15:07.489
How am I gonna stick this in a G-string?

15:08.782 --> 15:10.159
Where's everyone going?

15:10.242 --> 15:11.702
They're gonna miss our show!

15:12.703 --> 15:14.705
This is a sad, sad day.

15:14.788 --> 15:17.207
The white man never stops
putting you down.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.375
"The white man"?

15:18.459 --> 15:21.045
How could you not know
there was no gaming in Texas?

15:21.128 --> 15:23.672
Look, the dream business
is not extremely detail-oriented.

15:24.423 --> 15:25.299
Anyway,

15:25.382 --> 15:27.718
just stopped by
to give you a friendly reminder.

15:27.801 --> 15:29.845
You still owe us $23,000.

15:29.929 --> 15:30.846
I could sue you.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.058
Possibly, but you'd spend years
in the white man's courts

15:34.141 --> 15:35.684
fighting the white man's lawyers,

15:35.768 --> 15:36.810
which we have a lot of.

15:36.894 --> 15:39.063
Instead, I have a solution
that's good for all of us.

15:39.980 --> 15:42.358
Permit to allow toxic dumping?

15:42.441 --> 15:44.652
Unless you have another way
to come up with the money.

15:45.152 --> 15:46.654
Oh, and, uh, keep in mind

15:46.737 --> 15:48.405
your topsoil will become very flammable.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.035
Oh, not only have I failed as a musician,

15:53.118 --> 15:55.162
I'm gonna have to destroy my own land.

15:55.245 --> 15:56.497
My people's land.

15:57.998 --> 15:59.166
Come on, guys.

15:59.249 --> 16:01.210
Did we give up when I left the "E"

16:01.293 --> 16:03.671
off of all of our merchandise? No.

16:03.754 --> 16:06.090
And we wore those "Fudgecak" T-shirts

16:06.173 --> 16:07.174
with pride.

16:07.257 --> 16:09.551
Now, you guys keep focusing
on being stars,

16:09.635 --> 16:12.179
and I'll focus on a way to fix this.

16:14.431 --> 16:18.185
You look like I feel
whenever I run over one of my dogs.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.739
Everybody seems pretty happy.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.117
Bloomers has good buzz.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.035
Yep. We sure pulled it off.

16:35.119 --> 16:37.246
No, Hank. We all did.

16:37.746 --> 16:39.957
Oh. I mean, we did!

16:41.834 --> 16:43.544
Psst. Bloomers!

16:46.755 --> 16:48.799
-Get in the car!
-Why? I just got here.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.968
Hey, I'm driving you
to the green room, <i>ese.</i>

16:51.051 --> 16:52.720
I got all kinds of cheeses back there.

16:56.598 --> 16:57.558
Gribble?

16:57.641 --> 16:59.059
-<i>Got him.</i>
-Good.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.352
Make him disappear.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.729
You want me to kill him?

17:01.812 --> 17:03.063
What? No!

17:03.439 --> 17:04.565
Although...

17:04.648 --> 17:06.692
No, just drive him around,

17:06.775 --> 17:08.652
but I'm happy you're being pro-active.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.738
There are no bad ideas.

17:11.697 --> 17:13.824
I wanna go! I'm bored.

17:13.907 --> 17:15.826
You said this would be fun!

17:15.909 --> 17:18.078
I thought
there was gonna be Bloomers.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.788
Make Bloomers be here.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.498
Where the heck is Bloomers?

17:21.582 --> 17:23.584
Dad, things are not good.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.461
I've been circulating among the kids

17:25.544 --> 17:27.629
as "Roberto Hillenbrand,"

17:27.713 --> 17:28.839
and they're bored.

17:28.922 --> 17:30.257
If Bloomers doesn't show up,

17:30.340 --> 17:32.051
there's talk of a possible egging.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.720
Hank, what the heck is going on?

17:34.803 --> 17:36.930
I just got a back full of raw hamburger.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.766
I don't know what happened, sir.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.934
Now they're tipping over port-a-johns.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.269
If you got a plan "B,"

17:42.352 --> 17:44.063
you better put it into action pronto.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.816
Mr. Strickland makes a good point.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.527
All hell does appear to be breaking loose.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.822
At least if you book Fudgecake,
you tried something.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.199
Oh, let's tip this one over!

17:55.282 --> 17:57.451
Occupied, honey!

17:59.161 --> 18:01.455
Dale, get me Fudgecake.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.417
We got a gig! We got a gig!

18:05.501 --> 18:06.585
Oh, wow!

18:06.668 --> 18:08.504
The Strickland Family Days Picnic.

18:08.837 --> 18:09.963
Family Days?

18:10.047 --> 18:11.715
That ain't rock and roll.

18:11.799 --> 18:12.800
What does it matter?

18:12.883 --> 18:14.384
An audience is an audience.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.929
Fudgecake don't play family picnics.

18:17.012 --> 18:18.639
It'd send the wrong message.

18:18.722 --> 18:19.765
I ain't going.

18:19.848 --> 18:21.100
And I double ain't going.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.392
Are you crazy?

18:22.476 --> 18:25.187
This is a paying gig
with hundreds of people!

18:25.270 --> 18:28.273
Yeah, well, the 'cake don't sell out.

18:35.322 --> 18:36.365
Hank.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.201
What in the heck is going on?

18:39.284 --> 18:40.702
Where's the rest of the band?

18:40.786 --> 18:42.871
I thought I owed it to you
to tell you in person.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.248
We broke up.

18:44.331 --> 18:45.582
Fudgecake is dead.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.169
Well, I guess
I'll go break it to the crowd

18:49.253 --> 18:51.004
that we don't have any entertainment.

18:51.088 --> 18:53.632
They'll probably yell
and throw stuff at me.

18:53.715 --> 18:56.135
Then Buck will yell and throw stuff at me

18:56.218 --> 18:58.345
and fire me.

18:58.428 --> 19:00.472
Well, maybe
that'll be entertaining for folks.

19:00.556 --> 19:01.890
Hold on a second, Hank.

19:01.974 --> 19:05.060
John Redcorn, you're the heart
and soul of the 'cake, man!

19:05.144 --> 19:06.812
You can play this gig yourself!

19:06.895 --> 19:08.772
Alone? Me?

19:08.856 --> 19:11.358
Besides, kids aren't gonna want
to listen to me.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.569
The BMF sound is universal.

19:13.652 --> 19:14.820
You can adapt.

19:14.903 --> 19:15.863
Hmm...

19:15.946 --> 19:18.407
I guess there is
that song about killing myself.

19:18.490 --> 19:21.160
I could rewrite it
so it's about personal hygiene.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.162
Love it. Now, go!

19:27.749 --> 19:31.003
Hello, and welcome
to the Strickland Family Fun Day.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.546
I am John Redcorn.

19:32.629 --> 19:34.882
Here's a song I wrote
after government agents

19:34.965 --> 19:36.633
shut down my gambling establishment

19:36.717 --> 19:37.885

20:32.689 --> 20:34.733
Yeah, when I first found Redcorn,

20:34.816 --> 20:36.568
he was in some go-nowhere,

20:36.652 --> 20:40.864
Whitesnake-meets-White-Lion
meets-Great-White rip-off group,

20:41.198 --> 20:44.576
