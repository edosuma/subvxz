We're leaving for the airport
in 20 minutes, Phoenix.

00:30.863 --> 00:31.898
I'll be ready.

00:44.876 --> 00:46.977
<i>Hi, Phoenix. I know
it's a big day for you.</i>

00:46.979 --> 00:48.112
<i>I just wanted to tell you</i>

00:48.114 --> 00:50.680

<i>Oh, and Uncle Jack says he can't
wait to take you on safari.</i>

00:56.754 --> 00:59.758
<i>So safe flight. Lots of love
and see you soon. Bye.</i>

01:21.513 --> 01:23.549

Phoenix! Phoenix!
Over here!

03:23.901 --> 03:26.503
Hey! How was your flight?

03:26.505 --> 03:28.740
Oh, you must be exhausted.

03:29.073 --> 03:31.842
It was good. And yeah, I'm
ready to crash right now.

03:31.844 --> 03:33.946
Well, this is your uncle Jack.

03:34.546 --> 03:36.011
Hey, you, come here.
[grunts]

03:36.013 --> 03:38.183
[chuckles softly] It is so
great to finally meet you.

03:38.784 --> 03:40.419
Welcome to Africa.
Thanks.

03:40.751 --> 03:41.987
I'm glad to be here.

03:42.220 --> 03:43.954
Well, you have been
through so much

03:43.956 --> 03:45.722
and we're going to make
a great life for you here.

03:45.724 --> 03:47.526
Everything's going
to be fine, okay?

03:47.893 --> 03:50.630
Come on. Let me grab your bag, buddy.
The jeep's right over there.

04:06.978 --> 04:10.016
Hey, what do you think? A lot
different from America, isn't it?

04:10.816 --> 04:13.619
Yeah.
It's cool, though.

04:13.851 --> 04:15.520
Oh, it gets
pretty hot out here.

04:15.821 --> 04:17.786
That's an expression
the kids use.

04:17.788 --> 04:19.558
[chuckles] I know. I'm hip.

04:19.791 --> 04:21.190
Mmm-hmm.

04:21.192 --> 04:23.560
Our lodge isn't far
from here now, Phoenix.

04:23.562 --> 04:25.161
So, you're a veterinarian,
Uncle Jack?

04:25.163 --> 04:26.532
Yes, that's right.

04:27.666 --> 04:29.101
I do a lot of work with
conservation officers here,

04:29.834 --> 04:31.803
mainly trying to help
the big cats.

04:32.271 --> 04:34.707
That's so cool.
I love animals.

04:34.973 --> 04:38.077
Well, you have come
to the right place, sweetheart.

04:59.932 --> 05:00.933
Come on.

05:06.305 --> 05:08.708
Phoenix, this is Themba,
our reserve manager.

05:09.207 --> 05:11.243
Most people around here
call him Big Boss.

05:11.877 --> 05:12.778
It's nice to meet you, sir.

05:14.212 --> 05:16.949
We are so glad to have you here.
Welcome to Africa.

05:17.882 --> 05:20.116
Let me show you around, Phoenix.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

05:20.118 --> 05:23.820
This boy needs rest. I'm going
to get him fed and into bed.

05:23.822 --> 05:26.925
Oh, okay, then. I'll see
you tomorrow, Phoenix.

05:27.825 --> 05:29.793
And, by the way,
that's a very nice name.

05:29.795 --> 05:30.630
Thanks.

05:31.630 --> 05:32.298
This way.

05:43.875 --> 05:46.045
Well, here we are.
Home sweet home.

05:46.812 --> 05:47.947
Come on in.

05:55.954 --> 05:56.689
[Phoenix] Wow!

05:58.623 --> 06:00.289
- This place is amazing.
- [chuckles]

06:00.291 --> 06:03.029
Your Uncle Jack grew up here.
This was his parents' house.

06:23.048 --> 06:24.183
It's a Zulu spear.

06:25.450 --> 06:27.049
You wouldn't want to find yourself
at the end of one of these

06:27.051 --> 06:28.253
when a Zulu warrior
is holding it.

06:29.454 --> 06:32.358
Jack, Zulus are the nicest
people you can meet anywhere.

06:32.858 --> 06:33.625
Is Themba Zulu?

06:33.991 --> 06:35.093
He is indeed.

06:35.694 --> 06:37.327
Come on, let me
show you your room.

06:37.329 --> 06:39.165
We've got it
all ready for you.

06:46.003 --> 06:46.972
Follow me.

06:53.377 --> 06:54.113
Here you go.

07:00.284 --> 07:01.186
[exhales]

07:10.062 --> 07:13.162
This is so...
Cool, right? [chuckles]

07:13.164 --> 07:15.400
Yeah. Well, I'm so
glad you like it.

07:16.334 --> 07:19.068
Right. You get settled in and we'll
call you when dinner's ready, okay?

07:19.070 --> 07:21.840
Yeah. Okay. Here's your bag, sir.
See you later.

07:30.748 --> 07:31.916
[sighs]

08:06.384 --> 08:08.187
[Sarah] Phoenix!
Dinner's ready.

08:09.521 --> 08:10.456
Coming, Aunt Sarah.

08:15.760 --> 08:16.928
Thank you.
Hey.

08:17.863 --> 08:19.294
Well, I hope you're hungry.

08:19.296 --> 08:22.097
- Your Aunt Sarah is an amazing chef.
- You bet I am.

08:22.099 --> 08:22.867
[Aunt Sarah chuckles]

08:24.034 --> 08:25.103
Thank you so much.

08:27.204 --> 08:29.341
Thank you. Mmm.
Right.

08:34.011 --> 08:35.113
Aunt Sarah.
Yeah?

08:36.280 --> 08:37.683
Are there, like, other kids
here and stuff, maybe my age?

08:38.549 --> 08:41.784
Yeah, there are a few kids at some
of the other farms and reserves.

08:41.785 --> 08:43.188
I'm sure you're going
to get to meet them soon.

08:43.554 --> 08:45.420
The Fosters have
a very cute daughter,

08:45.422 --> 08:46.256
about your age.
[Phoenix chuckles]

08:47.425 --> 08:50.329
And what about school?
Will I go to school?

08:50.528 --> 08:54.065
Oh, yes. But lucky for you, school
doesn't start for another five weeks.

08:54.900 --> 08:57.403
So you have lots of time
just to relax and explore.

08:57.868 --> 08:59.135
Do the kids speak English?

08:59.137 --> 09:01.471
[snickers] Yes.
All the kids speak English.

09:01.473 --> 09:04.106
And lots of
other languages, too.

09:04.108 --> 09:06.809
Tomorrow, Phoenix, a group of us
are going on a little safari,

09:06.811 --> 09:09.511
a kind of inspection tour. Are
you interested in coming along?

09:09.513 --> 09:11.481
Jack, he only just got here.

09:11.483 --> 09:13.249
He'll be fine. We'll only
be gone for a few hours.

09:13.251 --> 09:14.353
Oh, I'd love to go.

09:15.252 --> 09:16.222
Are we going to see
lots of animals?

09:16.421 --> 09:17.956
Animals, I can guarantee.

09:19.190 --> 09:20.356
Please, can I go, Aunt Sarah?

09:20.358 --> 09:22.958
Mmm. Okay,
if you feel up to it.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.561
But, you have to get
a good night's sleep tonight.

09:24.563 --> 09:26.065
Oh, I will, I will.

09:26.998 --> 09:29.368
Mmm. May I have some salad, please?
Mmm-hmm.

09:35.974 --> 09:39.411
Hey. I just came to give you a kiss and
a cuddle good night, if that's okay.

09:40.211 --> 09:41.045
Or is that not cool?

09:42.113 --> 09:43.111
No, it's cool.

09:43.113 --> 09:44.215
[chuckles]

09:51.989 --> 09:53.291
Aunt Sarah?
Yeah.

09:59.964 --> 10:01.367
I miss my mum
and dad so much.

10:02.267 --> 10:03.435
Aw.

10:04.869 --> 10:06.169
Phoenix, I know.

10:06.171 --> 10:08.007
I can't imagine how hard
it's been for you.

10:09.541 --> 10:10.939
[sighs]

10:10.941 --> 10:12.143
I miss
my little sister, too.

10:13.310 --> 10:14.579
She was always there
for me.

10:18.650 --> 10:20.119
You and I are
going to be okay.

10:20.951 --> 10:23.052
We're going to get through
this and be a family.

10:23.054 --> 10:24.089
All right?

10:28.392 --> 10:30.028
Come on,
you get some sleep.

10:31.662 --> 10:34.297
It's your
big adventure tomorrow.

10:34.299 --> 10:35.534
It's going to be such fun.

10:39.137 --> 10:40.339
Good night.

10:54.219 --> 10:55.253
[grunts]

10:59.123 --> 11:01.090
Hey.
Hey.

11:01.092 --> 11:02.692
I packed him a lunch. I can't
rely on you to feed him.

11:02.694 --> 11:04.897
Oh, he'll be fine.
Good morning.

11:05.095 --> 11:07.130
Did you sleep well?
Like a log.

11:07.132 --> 11:09.468
Good. We'll be leaving
in two minutes.

11:10.468 --> 11:11.370
Bye, sweetheart.

11:12.671 --> 11:14.473
Love you. Bye.
Love you too.

11:21.211 --> 11:22.046
Phoenix?

11:24.214 --> 11:26.484
I've got special
welcome gift for you.

11:29.186 --> 11:29.820
This is for me?

11:31.522 --> 11:32.925
It's so cool looking.
Thanks.

11:34.325 --> 11:38.229
In Zulu we call him Indlovu,
the unstoppable one.

11:39.064 --> 11:43.199
And I think you are
the "unstoppable one."

11:43.435 --> 11:44.536
Indlovu.

11:45.502 --> 11:46.472
That's pretty cool.

11:47.272 --> 11:48.507
[Themba chuckles]

11:53.411 --> 11:54.613
Okay, let's move on out.

11:58.083 --> 11:59.485
Your first little safari.

13:00.110 --> 13:01.112
[camera clicks]

13:01.445 --> 13:02.314
Look at that.
Show me.

13:41.853 --> 13:43.752
[indistinct talking]

13:43.754 --> 13:45.490
[Jack] Look over there.
Some lions are over there.

13:47.724 --> 13:49.394
That's the other one.

13:56.334 --> 13:57.603
Hey, these are good.

14:06.243 --> 14:07.443
This is awesome.
[Jack] Good.

14:07.445 --> 14:08.781
Take some more. Look at that.
He's looking straight at you.

14:10.214 --> 14:10.782
They're big, eh?

14:26.897 --> 14:29.465
[conversations

[laughter]

14:31.802 --> 14:34.572
[continues in foreign language]

14:44.648 --> 14:45.750
Good quality.

14:47.685 --> 14:49.220
Nice size.

14:49.586 --> 14:51.654
Where did you find this bull?

14:51.656 --> 14:53.691
About five miles away,
that way.

14:54.691 --> 14:55.891
He was alone, I assume?

14:55.893 --> 14:58.329
Yeah, he was just
running around by himself.

14:58.662 --> 15:01.332
We'll never meet our quota
if we don't find the herd!

15:02.300 --> 15:04.299
My buyers are getting
impatient.

15:04.301 --> 15:08.440
Yeah, but Von Stein, I think these elephants
are, like, in the bush or the marsh.

15:08.739 --> 15:11.676
I don't want your excuses,
I want that herd!

15:13.444 --> 15:15.580
We need to increase
our aerial surveillance.

15:16.314 --> 15:17.583
Okay, Von Stein.

15:17.949 --> 15:20.519
No one gets paid
if we don't make our quota.

15:20.951 --> 15:22.720
Now go find those elephants!

15:23.387 --> 15:24.489
Von Stein...

15:26.456 --> 15:29.594
the rangers, they've increased
activity in that area.

15:29.826 --> 15:31.561
It will be difficult,
Von Stein!

15:31.563 --> 15:33.765
I said no more excuses!

15:39.603 --> 15:40.339
[door slams]
Come.

15:47.612 --> 15:49.581
It sure is beautiful out here.
Mmm-hmm.

15:50.348 --> 15:51.517
Africa is magical.

15:52.517 --> 15:53.584
Yes, indeed.

15:54.685 --> 15:58.486
In spite of her troubles,
Mother Africa is good to us.

15:58.488 --> 16:00.625
Oh, don't worry about
that stuff, Themba.

16:01.392 --> 16:02.326
What does he mean,
Uncle Jack?

16:02.594 --> 16:03.494
Never mind, Phoenix.

16:05.229 --> 16:07.632
We're going to be heading out soon.
Okay.

16:07.831 --> 16:09.298
Can I ride in
the rear jeep this time?

16:09.300 --> 16:11.502
That seat at the front?
That'd be cool.

16:12.336 --> 16:13.804
Sure. Just hang on tight.

16:15.839 --> 16:19.210
Okay, everyone.
Moving on. Come on.

16:31.823 --> 16:33.392
[chirping]

16:36.594 --> 16:37.760
Oh, hello.

16:37.762 --> 16:39.363
[chirps]

16:51.642 --> 16:52.411
Where're you going?

16:58.516 --> 16:59.685
Oh, there you are.

17:01.485 --> 17:02.353
Come here.

17:03.854 --> 17:04.722
[chirps]

17:05.289 --> 17:05.856
I won't hurt you.

17:37.721 --> 17:38.589
Come here.

17:47.798 --> 17:48.666
Come here, little guy.

18:01.345 --> 18:02.480
[sighs] Okay.

18:03.547 --> 18:04.482
Well, I better get back now.

18:07.684 --> 18:08.886
Did I come from this way?

18:12.789 --> 18:13.724
Uncle Jack?

18:31.808 --> 18:32.810
Oh, what am I gonna do?

18:34.711 --> 18:36.315
[grunts] Uncle Jack!

18:37.614 --> 18:38.316
Are you there?

18:39.650 --> 18:40.686
Anyone!

18:41.919 --> 18:43.322
Anyone, help!

19:04.142 --> 19:05.643
Is anyone out there?

19:19.524 --> 19:20.956
[panting]

19:20.958 --> 19:21.860
Help!

19:29.866 --> 19:31.103
Somebody, help!

19:44.449 --> 19:45.550
Hey.

19:46.717 --> 19:48.120
How was it?
It was great.

19:50.121 --> 19:51.986
- How did Phoenix like it?
- Oh, he loved it.

19:51.988 --> 19:53.121
Great. Where is he?

19:53.123 --> 19:54.825
He's back there
in the observer's chair.

19:56.626 --> 19:57.428
No, he isn't.

20:01.632 --> 20:02.933
Is Phoenix back
there with you?

20:06.903 --> 20:08.707
Oh, no, Jack!

20:13.710 --> 20:15.479
You don't have Phoenix?
No, boss.

20:15.779 --> 20:17.947
What... What have you done?

20:17.949 --> 20:19.651
But I sent him
to ride back with you.

20:19.917 --> 20:22.087
Nobody told me.
I thought he was with you.

20:22.753 --> 20:24.055
Where is he?

20:25.823 --> 20:26.958
We're going back
there right now.

20:27.859 --> 20:29.792
Stay calm, Sarah.

20:29.794 --> 20:31.430
I know the exact spot we stopped at.
We'll find him.

20:31.962 --> 20:34.565
I'm coming with you! All
right, we're moving out.

20:34.865 --> 20:36.098
Somebody, help!

20:36.100 --> 20:37.669
[breathing heavily]

20:47.210 --> 20:48.479
Is anyone there?

20:50.081 --> 20:51.616
Is anyone there?

21:08.533 --> 21:09.668
Phoenix!

21:12.536 --> 21:13.738
Phoenix!

21:14.905 --> 21:15.806
Phoenix!

21:16.540 --> 21:17.741
It's Uncle Jack.

21:18.742 --> 21:20.809
He's not here, Jack.
Where is he?

21:20.811 --> 21:22.848
He must be close by.
This is the exact spot.

21:24.180 --> 21:26.684
Everyone, spread out!
Search the bush!

21:30.587 --> 21:31.755
[speaks in other language]

21:32.289 --> 21:34.790
Themba, get Colonel Ibori
on the radio.

21:34.792 --> 21:36.624
We need his men
and a helicopter.

21:36.626 --> 21:37.261
Yes, boss.

21:41.164 --> 21:43.966
He just arrived.
He cannot survive alone!

21:43.968 --> 21:45.003
We will find him!

22:54.071 --> 22:55.740
[speaks in other language]

22:56.740 --> 22:57.709
Nothing?

22:58.342 --> 23:00.011
Nothing. Not a trace.

23:00.311 --> 23:01.276
What do you think
could have happened?

23:01.278 --> 23:03.411
He was going to ride back
in a different jeep.

23:03.413 --> 23:05.147
He must have wandered off
into the bush

23:05.149 --> 23:06.685
and we drove off without him.

23:07.418 --> 23:09.118
Okay. Well, my men
are expert trackers.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.186
They'll stay out all night

23:11.188 --> 23:12.791
and the helicopter will continue
the search with thermal imaging.

23:13.056 --> 23:14.422
We have to find him.

23:14.424 --> 23:15.893
We'll find him, Sarah.

23:16.227 --> 23:18.994
He only arrived yesterday,
he's out there all alone.

23:18.996 --> 23:20.228
[Jack] I'm sorry, Sarah.

23:20.230 --> 23:22.200
We will find him,
I promise you.

23:22.999 --> 23:25.103
I cannot bury another
member of my family.

23:39.917 --> 23:40.785
[sighs]

23:41.352 --> 23:42.821
Sure glad I have this.

23:43.086 --> 23:44.288
[low growl]

23:46.423 --> 23:47.224
Who's there?

23:49.826 --> 23:50.628
I have a rock!

23:57.901 --> 23:58.870
I have more, you know.

24:03.140 --> 24:04.275
[breathing heavily]

24:08.211 --> 24:09.279
I'm not getting
any sleep tonight.

24:17.888 --> 24:19.357
Boss.

24:19.989 --> 24:22.293
There is a lot of helicopter
activity in the area tonight.

24:22.793 --> 24:24.062
Any idea why?

24:24.295 --> 24:26.328
We've been monitoring
the radio chatter.

24:26.330 --> 24:27.832
Apparently a boy
has gone missing.

24:28.065 --> 24:29.933
A boy? Interesting.

24:31.199 --> 24:32.202
Yes. An American boy.

24:32.803 --> 24:35.674
An American boy?
Even more interesting.

24:36.907 --> 24:39.041
But American boys
don't concern me right now.

24:39.043 --> 24:40.175
Finding that herd does.

24:40.177 --> 24:41.476
I don't know, Boss.

24:41.478 --> 24:43.344
Maybe we should lay low
for a little while

24:43.346 --> 24:45.313
until the authorities
find this boy

24:45.315 --> 24:47.184
and clear out of the area.

24:47.785 --> 24:51.820
I said, lost American boys
don't concern me.

24:51.822 --> 24:54.489
That herd is worth
millions in ivory,

24:54.491 --> 24:56.324
and I want it found
right away.

24:56.326 --> 24:58.262
Is that clear?
Yes, Boss.

24:58.996 --> 25:00.431
We've set many traps
in the bush.

25:01.097 --> 25:02.363
We'll check on it
again tomorrow.

25:02.365 --> 25:03.334
Good.

25:06.970 --> 25:08.305
[water drips]

25:55.952 --> 25:57.518
Colonel. Good morning.

25:57.520 --> 25:59.353
Good morning, Sarah.
Have you seen, Jack?

25:59.355 --> 26:01.323
He went ahead
with some of the men.

26:01.325 --> 26:02.858
You're riding
with us today.

26:02.860 --> 26:04.362
But first you need
to grab some breakfast.

26:04.995 --> 26:06.930
No, I can't.
We've got to get going.

26:07.463 --> 26:09.497
Uh, did the searchers
find anything?

26:09.499 --> 26:11.035
I'm afraid nothing yet.

26:11.835 --> 26:12.903
What are we going to do?

26:14.138 --> 26:15.406
We're going to search in a grid
pattern, by air and by land.

26:17.106 --> 26:18.375
Okay. Let's get going.
All right.

26:33.457 --> 26:34.892
[rumbling]

26:47.171 --> 26:48.806
[rumbling continues]

27:15.332 --> 27:16.398
I can help you.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.369
[rumbles]

27:22.338 --> 27:23.173
I can help you.

27:26.343 --> 27:27.845
You'll be free soon, okay?

27:31.215 --> 27:32.217
Don't worry.

27:33.517 --> 27:34.582
You'll be free soon.

27:34.584 --> 27:36.220
[rumbling]

27:45.028 --> 27:46.530
[rumbling]

27:53.003 --> 27:54.138
Please don't hurt me.

27:55.271 --> 27:56.373
Please don't hurt me.

28:04.315 --> 28:05.350
Maybe you're friendly?

28:07.584 --> 28:09.353
Uh, I'm Phoenix.

28:10.421 --> 28:11.620
Do you have a name?

28:11.622 --> 28:13.287
[growling softly]

28:13.289 --> 28:14.658
If only I spoke elephant,
I'd know your name.

28:15.191 --> 28:17.060
What about Indlovu?

28:17.527 --> 28:19.197
It means unstoppable one,
you know?

28:19.563 --> 28:22.130
Yeah. I think you like that.

28:22.132 --> 28:23.567
Hey, want to see
something cool, boy?

28:29.405 --> 28:30.407
Check that out, Indlovu.

28:33.242 --> 28:35.412
I think you like that. I think
this means we're friends now.

28:37.480 --> 28:38.449
I'm lost, you know.

28:39.415 --> 28:41.518
Have you seen any people?

28:42.385 --> 28:44.521
You know, people, like me?

28:47.157 --> 28:47.891
Yeah, that's what I thought.

28:48.592 --> 28:50.027
Uh, maybe you could
lead me to them.

29:09.680 --> 29:11.545
Let's get up over that ridge
and have a look.

29:11.547 --> 29:12.416
Yes, boss.

29:20.591 --> 29:23.261
[sighs] Where is he?

29:23.594 --> 29:24.629
It's okay, boss.
We'll find him.

29:25.763 --> 29:27.332
This is all my fault.

29:44.680 --> 29:46.584
Someone is messing with us.

29:56.259 --> 29:58.363
Hey. People.

29:59.563 --> 30:00.631
Indlovu, people!

30:01.297 --> 30:02.532
[rumbles softly]

30:03.366 --> 30:04.334
Indlovu, people!

30:09.238 --> 30:10.440
Hello?

30:12.676 --> 30:13.544
Hello?

30:15.278 --> 30:16.314
Anybody here?

30:31.628 --> 30:32.497
Run!

30:33.396 --> 30:35.565
Run, Indlovu! Come on!

30:36.333 --> 30:39.269
Come on, we don't have much time.
Come on! Come on! Come on!

30:39.670 --> 30:41.572
I want you to find
whoever cut those ropes.

30:49.212 --> 30:50.347
Come on!

30:52.548 --> 30:53.715
[rumbling faintly]

30:53.717 --> 30:55.119
Come on! Come on! Come on!

30:57.453 --> 30:58.789
Come on! Come on!

31:00.223 --> 31:02.392
Come on!
Come on, we have to run!

31:03.559 --> 31:04.796
We have to run! Come on!

31:07.163 --> 31:10.198
Come on! Come on! Run!

31:10.200 --> 31:12.103
Come on! Run! Faster, boy!

31:13.336 --> 31:14.571
[panting]

31:21.478 --> 31:22.647
They almost caught me.

31:25.716 --> 31:26.717
Indlovu...

31:27.918 --> 31:29.087
those are very bad men.

31:31.255 --> 31:32.290
They're killing elephants.

31:34.557 --> 31:35.625
I need to rest for a bit.

31:45.369 --> 31:46.471
[grunts]

31:55.746 --> 31:58.615
Oh, man, that's so good.
Starving.

32:00.616 --> 32:01.853
Want one, boy?
Here you go.

32:03.219 --> 32:04.387
It's an orange.
Have you seen one?

32:05.588 --> 32:06.256
You like oranges?

32:07.557 --> 32:08.058
There you go, boy.

32:09.359 --> 32:10.228
You do like that, huh?

32:10.594 --> 32:11.728
[chuckles]

32:17.234 --> 32:18.469
Oh!

32:18.669 --> 32:19.704
[chuckling] Careful, boy.

32:21.537 --> 32:22.405
Silly boy.

32:23.273 --> 32:24.142
Here.

32:24.473 --> 32:25.675
Back up.

32:26.677 --> 32:27.612
I didn't know
elephants eat them.

32:33.217 --> 32:34.352
All right, let's see
what else we got.

32:39.655 --> 32:40.690
Hey, a canteen!

32:42.491 --> 32:43.693
Now this will come in handy.

32:58.842 --> 33:00.611
Check these out, Indlovu.

33:03.279 --> 33:03.748
So cool.

33:07.417 --> 33:08.553
What else...

33:11.622 --> 33:13.658
Fire at last. [chuckles]

33:36.646 --> 33:37.581
Anything?

33:37.847 --> 33:38.882
No, nothing so far.

33:39.449 --> 33:41.283
We are running out
of time fast.

33:41.285 --> 33:42.684
I mean, he just wandered off
into the bush

33:42.686 --> 33:44.054
without so much
as a water bottle.

33:44.787 --> 33:47.755
We have a 100 men looking and the
helicopters searching non-stop.

33:47.757 --> 33:49.526
But he could be
anywhere by now.

33:50.459 --> 33:52.997
I'm so sorry about this. I don't
know what I was thinking.

33:54.363 --> 33:55.932
Well, let's just
get him back.

33:56.466 --> 33:57.368
Agreed.

33:58.168 --> 33:59.536
Let's set up camp
for the night.

34:00.603 --> 34:01.706
[speaks in foreign language]

34:08.978 --> 34:10.013
[faint growl]

34:21.456 --> 34:22.525
Oh, it's so good.

34:28.732 --> 34:31.098
Here. Got one for you
right here, bud.

34:31.100 --> 34:32.435
No, you can't have
all of them.

34:33.002 --> 34:33.803
Indlovu.

34:34.971 --> 34:36.437
Come on, boy.
Come on, let it go.

34:36.438 --> 34:37.739
Indlovu.

34:37.741 --> 34:39.342
Come on, give it.

34:44.746 --> 34:47.047
I can already tell I'm going to
sleep so much better tonight

34:47.049 --> 34:48.784
with the fire
and you guarding me, Indlovu.

34:56.893 --> 34:57.962
Do you have a family, Indlovu?

35:01.531 --> 35:02.400
Hmm.

35:03.466 --> 35:04.734
So much I don't
know about you.

35:07.002 --> 35:08.772
Maybe we've both
lost our families.

35:10.006 --> 35:11.341
I'll help you
find them, Indlovu.

35:14.477 --> 35:15.445
I'll help you find them.

35:26.422 --> 35:28.959
Boss, we have a possible
aerial sighting of the herd.

35:29.493 --> 35:30.692
Here are the coordinates.

35:30.694 --> 35:31.762
A possible sighting?

35:32.863 --> 35:34.931
Either the pilot saw the
elephants, or he didn't.

35:36.466 --> 35:37.468
Give me the coordinates.

35:37.968 --> 35:38.835
Here.

35:47.477 --> 35:49.779
That would place the herd
right about there.

35:51.013 --> 35:55.385
At first light, we head back to
base camp, resupply and head out.

35:55.819 --> 35:57.688
Yes, boss.

35:57.888 --> 36:00.924
Time's running out for those elephants.
We're going to find them.

36:12.803 --> 36:13.804
Indlovu?

36:18.507 --> 36:19.009
Indlovu!

36:19.942 --> 36:21.176
Indlovu!

36:21.178 --> 36:22.446
[rumbling]

36:28.084 --> 36:29.453
Oh, there you are, boy.

36:31.053 --> 36:32.455
I was so worried
you ran away from me.

36:35.192 --> 36:36.927
Please always stay
right beside me, okay?

36:37.861 --> 36:39.493
Okay?

36:39.495 --> 36:41.131
Today we need to find
our families, Indlovu.

36:43.533 --> 36:44.067
Come, boy.

36:56.846 --> 36:57.982
Something?

36:58.982 --> 36:59.884
Have a listen.

37:04.154 --> 37:04.955
[sighs]

37:05.589 --> 37:07.024
I was afraid of this.

37:08.658 --> 37:09.527
Keep at it.

37:11.194 --> 37:13.531
Jack! Sarah?
[Sarah] Yes, Colonel?

37:15.564 --> 37:18.165
I have just been
listening to the radio.

37:18.167 --> 37:21.905
I believe we may have intercepted some
radio chatter from elephant poachers.

37:23.172 --> 37:24.073
They're in the area?

37:25.709 --> 37:26.977
We're quite certain they are.

37:27.810 --> 37:29.879
They may even be
Blake Von Stein's men.

37:30.881 --> 37:33.080
Well, who's Blake Von Stein?

37:33.082 --> 37:34.984
He's a notorious
elephant poacher.

37:36.118 --> 37:38.920
Phoenix is lost out there.
These are dangerous men.

37:38.922 --> 37:40.554
Let's not overreact, Sarah.

37:40.556 --> 37:42.690
These men want ivory,
not children.

37:42.692 --> 37:45.228
She's right, though. They are
heavily armed dangerous men.

37:46.161 --> 37:47.598
I know. I know.

37:48.564 --> 37:50.864
We'll have to exercise
great caution.

37:50.866 --> 37:53.600
I wouldn't be surprised if
they've already been alerted

37:53.602 --> 37:55.236
to our presence here.

37:55.238 --> 37:57.741
They have a network of spies,
planes, helicopters, everything.

37:58.308 --> 38:01.208
[scoffs] This just goes
from bad to worse.

38:01.210 --> 38:03.243
Not only is Phoenix
lost out there,

38:03.245 --> 38:06.781
but we're now up against a private army
who are better equipped than we are!

38:06.783 --> 38:09.683
The ivory trade
is worth millions, Sarah,

38:09.685 --> 38:11.254
they always have
the advantage.

38:12.556 --> 38:15.626
But my men are dedicated and well-trained.
They'll find the boy.

38:21.698 --> 38:22.732
Good boy.

38:28.605 --> 38:29.640
Oh, no.

38:30.707 --> 38:31.509
Oh, no.

38:34.710 --> 38:35.645
Oh, no.

38:43.053 --> 38:45.256
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

38:57.366 --> 38:58.067
Oh, no.

39:02.272 --> 39:03.707
[tearfully]
Look what they've done.

39:04.207 --> 39:05.875
[Indlovu rumbles]

39:07.143 --> 39:08.679
[Phoenix sobs]

39:17.286 --> 39:18.656
We have to stop this.

39:20.991 --> 39:23.160
We have to stop this!
[coughs]

39:25.361 --> 39:27.064
Come on. Come on.

39:28.364 --> 39:29.299
It's not safe out here.

39:30.667 --> 39:31.235
Come on.

39:32.301 --> 39:33.169
Come.

39:39.408 --> 39:40.877
[wild boars squeal and grunt]

39:51.754 --> 39:53.156
I don't know
what to do, Indlovu.

39:56.326 --> 39:57.761
I just don't know
what to do.

40:09.239 --> 40:10.808
You know what, boy?

40:12.274 --> 40:14.210
I bet I could ride you.
You're super smart.

40:15.344 --> 40:16.846
I'll bet you could
follow what I say.

40:19.948 --> 40:21.084
Look, boy.

40:22.886 --> 40:23.984
[faint rumbling]

40:23.986 --> 40:25.055
No, not yet.

40:25.989 --> 40:27.257
First try and follow
what I say.

40:29.024 --> 40:30.994
Okay, now back up...

40:31.694 --> 40:32.328
back,

40:32.995 --> 40:34.131
back. Good boy.

40:34.997 --> 40:35.929
That's good.

40:35.931 --> 40:37.167
Now come forward.

40:38.100 --> 40:39.102
Forward.

40:40.035 --> 40:41.638
Good. Good boy.

40:42.906 --> 40:45.109
Now, down.

40:46.710 --> 40:47.344
Come down.

40:51.781 --> 40:53.651
Good boy. Good boy.

40:54.084 --> 40:55.051
All right.

41:00.022 --> 41:02.258
Okay. Here we go, boy.

41:02.959 --> 41:05.228
It's okay. Here I come.

41:06.730 --> 41:07.698
It's all right.

41:15.772 --> 41:16.306
We did it.

41:17.406 --> 41:18.406
All right, get up.

41:18.408 --> 41:20.241
Come on. Up, boy. Good.

41:20.243 --> 41:21.775
Good. Good boy.
[chuckles]

41:21.777 --> 41:22.946
Good boy.

41:24.781 --> 41:25.716
There you go, boy.

41:25.982 --> 41:27.351
Good boy.

41:27.850 --> 41:29.385
See I knew you were
super smart.

41:30.754 --> 41:33.857
Come on. Good boy.
Good boy! Let's go.

42:03.786 --> 42:05.022
Think you can
swim across that, boy?

42:06.989 --> 42:09.026
I'll bet you can.
You can do anything.

42:10.259 --> 42:11.227
Okay, let's go.

42:13.930 --> 42:16.332
Forward, boy, forward.

42:17.100 --> 42:18.302
[laughs]

42:19.067 --> 42:20.103
I knew you could do it, boy.

42:32.080 --> 42:33.283
Nothing can stop you.

42:36.018 --> 42:37.321
Whoo! [laughs]

42:46.094 --> 42:46.930
Good job.

42:56.872 --> 42:59.408
Yeah, boy. Good job.

43:02.946 --> 43:04.982
- Nothing can stop us!
- [trumpets]

43:05.848 --> 43:06.350
Good boy.

43:17.125 --> 43:17.995
Welcome, boss.

43:18.861 --> 43:20.296
Are we any closer
to finding that herd?

43:20.562 --> 43:22.395
The men are all
out looking, boss.

43:22.397 --> 43:23.966
There's search and rescue
people in the area.

43:24.167 --> 43:26.170
Yeah, I know. We've been
monitoring their chatter.

43:26.368 --> 43:29.439
But they don't concern me right
now, only finding that herd does.

43:29.906 --> 43:31.973
Boss, what about
the cow and calf?

43:31.975 --> 43:35.076
I made a deal for them with a broker who
will sell them to a zoo in Germany.

43:35.078 --> 43:36.011
They'll leave in three days.

43:36.013 --> 43:39.315
We'll need the usual
forged export documents.

43:40.415 --> 43:42.919
But in the meantime, find me that herd.
Yes, boss.

43:49.359 --> 43:51.424
I should never have let him
out of my sight.

43:51.426 --> 43:52.562
I'm really sorry, Sarah.

43:55.163 --> 43:57.130
I know I've been angry
these past few days,

43:57.132 --> 43:59.602
but I realize
it was an accident

44:01.036 --> 44:03.040
and I don't want you
to blame yourself any longer.

44:03.672 --> 44:05.042
Let's just get him back, okay?

44:06.241 --> 44:07.377
Okay.

44:12.515 --> 44:13.350
Let's head on back.
Come on. Yeah.

44:30.265 --> 44:32.199
Jack. Sarah.

44:32.201 --> 44:34.201
I have given this matter
a lot of thought.

44:34.203 --> 44:37.040
It may be too dangerous
for you to continue with us.

44:37.607 --> 44:40.274
What are you talking about?
I've lived here for ten years.

44:40.276 --> 44:42.245
I know the African bush
and its dangers.

44:43.145 --> 44:44.480
Things have changed.

44:45.080 --> 44:47.448
If we encounter Von Stein's men,
there will be gun fire.

44:47.450 --> 44:49.984
They're heavily armed and they won't
be taken down without a fight.

44:49.986 --> 44:51.252
You're not a ranger.

44:51.254 --> 44:53.386
I simply can't put you
in that kind of risk.

44:53.388 --> 44:56.259
Well, I'm not going back.
That's my boy out there!

44:56.658 --> 44:57.994
Neither am I, Colonel.

44:58.328 --> 45:00.027
Okay, fine.

45:00.029 --> 45:00.995
Let's leave this
matter for now,

45:00.997 --> 45:03.163
but if I feel the situation
is too dangerous,

45:03.165 --> 45:05.501
I will order you back.
I'm sorry.

45:06.069 --> 45:06.670
Okay.

45:15.143 --> 45:16.446
Good. Good boy.

45:19.015 --> 45:20.317
Watch out! Watch out, boy!

45:22.652 --> 45:23.520
[chuckles] All right.

45:37.100 --> 45:38.368
I think we're
almost there, boy.

45:39.669 --> 45:40.569
Wherever there is.

45:41.036 --> 45:42.172
Indlovu, people.

45:43.172 --> 45:44.708
We gotta be a lot more
careful this time.

45:45.408 --> 45:46.476
It could be those bad men.

45:48.044 --> 45:49.613
Okay, stop here, boy.
Stop here.

46:02.725 --> 46:06.226
Come, boy.
Very slow, very slow.

46:06.228 --> 46:07.464
[rumbles faintly]
Shh.

46:16.205 --> 46:18.976
It's them, boy.
Bad men that kill elephants.

46:23.145 --> 46:26.082
Indlovu, they have
two elephants down there,

46:27.283 --> 46:28.382
a big one and a baby.

46:28.384 --> 46:31.021
[rumbling]

46:31.754 --> 46:33.723
Is that...
is that your mate?

46:35.625 --> 46:36.560
Is that your baby?

46:39.062 --> 46:40.661
What are we
going to do, Indlovu?

46:40.663 --> 46:42.332
They've captured
your mate and baby.

46:42.665 --> 46:44.101
What are we going to do?
We have to free them.

46:44.600 --> 46:46.036
[rumbles]

46:51.107 --> 46:53.576
No, Indlovu, stop!
They have guns, boy, guns.

46:54.109 --> 46:56.278
If they see you,
they'll shoot you, okay? Back.

46:56.846 --> 46:58.081
Don't you know what a gun is?

47:00.216 --> 47:01.250
Good boy.

47:02.718 --> 47:04.020
We'll save them, Indlovu.

47:04.620 --> 47:05.788
Me and you, we'll save them.

47:07.122 --> 47:09.422
First, we need a plan.
All right?

47:09.424 --> 47:10.660
A real plan.

47:12.094 --> 47:12.661
Come on, boy.

47:14.196 --> 47:15.031
Come!

47:16.431 --> 47:18.768
Come on. Good boy.
Good boy. Come on.

47:19.734 --> 47:20.636
Come, Indlovu.

47:28.678 --> 47:32.315
Indlovu, maybe we should
just keep going.

47:33.850 --> 47:35.719
Try to find some people
to help us, like the police.

47:36.285 --> 47:37.784
[rumbles]

47:37.786 --> 47:39.522
I know, boy. I know.

47:41.156 --> 47:42.225
I said we'd do it together.

47:43.259 --> 47:44.060
Here, boy.

47:44.826 --> 47:46.129
At least I don't have
to peel yours.

47:47.629 --> 47:48.497
Go on.

47:51.634 --> 47:52.836
They have guns, Indlovu.

47:54.536 --> 47:55.672
I need to think of something.

48:00.810 --> 48:01.745
Night, Indlovu.

48:07.850 --> 48:09.118
What's the plan
for tomorrow, Colonel?

48:11.154 --> 48:13.453
At first light, we'll search
the Southern Ridge.

48:13.455 --> 48:16.692
The other areas have been swept
by ground crew and aerial units.

48:17.660 --> 48:19.859
I really feel we're
running out of time.

48:19.861 --> 48:21.197
There's not a trace
of him anywhere.

48:21.464 --> 48:22.599
He's out there.

48:23.533 --> 48:24.433
We'll find him.

48:25.801 --> 48:28.238
And those poachers,
they're giving me nightmares.

48:29.504 --> 48:31.672
As Colonel Ibori
was saying earlier,

48:31.674 --> 48:32.843
they're not interested
in children.

48:34.343 --> 48:35.909
I'm going to the tent...

48:35.911 --> 48:37.547
to not sleep.

48:45.488 --> 48:46.723
Look at this, Indlovu.

48:47.355 --> 48:48.524
This is a gun.

48:49.558 --> 48:50.560
Watch me, Indlovu.

48:51.393 --> 48:52.428
This is a gun.

48:53.529 --> 48:54.498
[mimics gunshot]

48:57.332 --> 48:59.168
A gun is bad, boy. Bad.

49:00.368 --> 49:03.506
It kills, Indlovu.
It kills. The gun is bad.

49:10.379 --> 49:11.748
Well done. Good boy.

49:12.381 --> 49:14.484
Here, take it.

49:15.250 --> 49:16.185
Good boy.

49:27.529 --> 49:28.665
Down, Indlovu.

49:31.433 --> 49:32.569
Good boy.

49:33.669 --> 49:34.603
Good.

49:40.643 --> 49:42.243
[grunts]

49:42.245 --> 49:42.946
All right.

49:45.281 --> 49:45.916
Come on, boy, up!

49:48.984 --> 49:49.949
Let's go, boy.

49:49.951 --> 49:51.453
[trumpets]

50:03.466 --> 50:05.531
[clears throat]

50:05.533 --> 50:06.468
Boss?

50:08.437 --> 50:10.540
Where's that herd?
I want that herd.

50:10.772 --> 50:12.573
All the men are
out looking now.

50:12.575 --> 50:14.975
And what about the export documents
for the cow and the calf?

50:14.977 --> 50:17.247
They're ready. I'm going
to go pick them up now.

50:17.613 --> 50:18.681
We'll be ready
to move them out.

50:18.980 --> 50:19.915
You better be.

50:24.553 --> 50:26.723
[indistinct chatter]

50:32.560 --> 50:33.796
Gun, Indlovu! Gun!

50:34.830 --> 50:36.562
Get them, boy. Get them!

50:36.564 --> 50:38.031
[yelling in other language]

50:38.033 --> 50:39.736
Get them, boy. Get them!

50:41.536 --> 50:43.404
[yelling continues]

50:43.406 --> 50:44.507
Get them!

50:47.509 --> 50:48.410
Get them, boy.

50:50.346 --> 50:52.248
Get them! Get them!

50:55.417 --> 50:56.419
Come on, Indlovu.

50:58.953 --> 50:59.989
Get them!

51:00.589 --> 51:02.422
[Phoenix laughs]

51:02.424 --> 51:03.759
[yelling in other language]

51:06.027 --> 51:08.631
Get them!
[yells in other language]

51:16.839 --> 51:18.607
[rumbles]

51:19.741 --> 51:20.709
Yeah, you better run!

51:23.511 --> 51:26.048
Stop here, boy. Whoa.
Yeah, take that, Indlovu.

51:32.788 --> 51:33.623
All right, throw it!

51:36.959 --> 51:37.893
Awesome.

51:40.863 --> 51:41.897
Yeah, take that, Indlovu.

51:50.739 --> 51:51.940
Good boy. Nice.

51:52.707 --> 51:53.776
Down, Indlovu.

52:03.785 --> 52:04.720
Good boy.

52:06.522 --> 52:08.658
I'll bet there's some stuff
in here we can use.

52:15.497 --> 52:16.965
Won't be needing these
anymore, will they, boy?

52:21.437 --> 52:23.440
I think we gave those guys
a good scare, huh?

52:31.913 --> 52:33.415
Won't be needing these either,
will they?

52:36.685 --> 52:38.788
Okay, let's get going, boy.

52:39.754 --> 52:41.623
They're gonna be back soon
and they'll be mad for sure.

52:42.491 --> 52:43.593
[rumbles]

52:47.129 --> 52:48.064
[grunts softly]

52:52.201 --> 52:53.903
Sir, have you seen
Colonel Ibori?

52:54.569 --> 52:56.672
No, I haven't. He must be
scouting just ahead.

52:57.138 --> 52:58.507
Do you have any news?

52:59.709 --> 53:01.542
One of the aerial units
may have spotted some poachers.

53:01.544 --> 53:02.779
I have the coordinates.

53:03.212 --> 53:06.145
Well, give it to me.
I'll make sure he gets it.

53:06.147 --> 53:07.883
Thank you, sir.
My pleasure.

53:12.520 --> 53:13.953
Jack!
Yeah?

53:13.955 --> 53:15.688
I think we've spotted
a way through.

53:15.690 --> 53:17.024
We'll move out
in five minutes.

53:17.026 --> 53:18.995
Great. I'll make sure Sarah's ready.
Mmm-hmm.

53:20.895 --> 53:22.832
[indistinct chatter]

53:23.665 --> 53:25.067
[men panting]

53:26.468 --> 53:27.436
Water.

53:30.739 --> 53:32.409
[mumbles]

53:34.977 --> 53:36.513
[chuckles]

53:37.680 --> 53:38.681
What happened to you two?

53:42.917 --> 53:45.454
Yeah, we were attacked
by a giant bull, boss.

53:45.687 --> 53:46.722
Why didn't you shoot it?

53:47.989 --> 53:51.060
It came at us by surprise, boss.
It just came out of the bush.

53:51.560 --> 53:53.926
You're supposed to be
professional hunters.

53:53.928 --> 53:55.664
You look quite useless to me.

53:56.098 --> 53:57.767
Yeah, there's
something else, boss.

53:59.033 --> 54:00.102
There was a boy.

54:00.502 --> 54:01.904
A boy?
Yeah.

54:02.904 --> 54:03.906
What boy?

54:05.507 --> 54:08.942
There was a boy riding the bull, telling
him what to do, telling him to chase us.

54:08.944 --> 54:10.779
[laughs]

54:12.915 --> 54:16.650
You mean to tell me there was a boy
in the bush on top of an elephant

54:16.652 --> 54:19.051
and the boy was telling
the elephant to chase you?

54:19.053 --> 54:20.120
Yes, boss.
Yes, boss.

54:20.122 --> 54:21.825
You've been in
the sun too long.

54:22.591 --> 54:24.460
It's true, boss.
I also saw it.

54:24.792 --> 54:27.661
Great. Now I have
two guys with sunstroke.

54:27.663 --> 54:30.767
[Bafana laughs] Get out of my sight!
Move it!

54:33.835 --> 54:35.171
What do you think?

54:35.571 --> 54:37.207
I don't know but I'm
going to find out.

54:40.676 --> 54:42.875
Hey, be careful. [scoffs]

54:42.877 --> 54:45.112
Don't get chased by the boy
and his elephant.

54:45.114 --> 54:47.313
[men laughing and chattering]

54:47.315 --> 54:48.750
[shushing]

54:50.051 --> 54:51.086
[softly] Stop. Stop.

54:56.158 --> 54:58.127
[indistinct chatter continues]

55:01.997 --> 55:03.065
They've got guns, boy.

55:12.308 --> 55:14.110
[laughter]

55:15.977 --> 55:19.014
All right. Man, sorry. I know
you took one for the team, man.

55:21.817 --> 55:23.719
[men laughing]

55:34.096 --> 55:35.098
[softly]
I got the guns, boy.

55:38.734 --> 55:39.869
Okay, boy, let's go.

55:42.770 --> 55:43.770
[rumbles]

55:43.772 --> 55:45.174
[all gasp]

55:46.241 --> 55:47.643
[yelling indistinctly]

55:48.977 --> 55:50.946
Guns! Grab the guns!

55:51.212 --> 55:52.379
They're gone!

55:52.381 --> 55:54.017
Good boy! Get the tent.
Grab the tent.

56:09.797 --> 56:10.700
Good boy!

56:13.301 --> 56:14.202
Throw it!

56:17.138 --> 56:18.575
Good boy! Good boy!

56:37.926 --> 56:39.326
[Bafana sighs]

56:39.328 --> 56:41.127
[clears throat]

56:41.129 --> 56:43.929
Well?
Uh, well, boss,

56:43.931 --> 56:47.234
these men were also attacked
by the boy riding the elephant.

56:47.236 --> 56:48.738
No!

56:49.038 --> 56:51.040
What are you telling me?
Have you all gone mad?

56:51.339 --> 56:52.973
It's true, boss. It's true.

56:52.975 --> 56:54.710
Why didn't you shoot it?

56:54.910 --> 56:57.913
He came in very fast. We
couldn't even find our guns.

56:58.247 --> 57:00.382
You couldn't find your guns!

57:01.250 --> 57:03.286
The boy, he must
have stolen them.

57:04.352 --> 57:07.155
So, he walked right into your
camp and stole your guns.

57:07.855 --> 57:10.926
The boy stole guns
from professional hunters!

57:11.359 --> 57:13.796
Boss, what do you
want us to do?

57:14.029 --> 57:16.797
I want every man
in this camp out there.

57:16.799 --> 57:19.369
I want you to find
that boy, now!

57:21.837 --> 57:22.405
Now!

57:23.238 --> 57:25.073
[yells in other language]

57:27.276 --> 57:28.111
Move out!

57:50.198 --> 57:51.667
[whistles]

58:02.444 --> 58:03.712
We have to be careful, boy.

58:04.747 --> 58:06.181
There could be more of them
out here anywhere.

58:24.832 --> 58:25.300
Turn right.

58:26.468 --> 58:27.170
Good boy.

58:37.111 --> 58:39.381
Stay here, boy. Let me
check out what's up there.

58:40.415 --> 58:41.183
I'll be right back.

58:42.484 --> 58:44.219
[low rumbling]

58:56.931 --> 58:58.531
Let me go! Let me go!
You are coming with me.

58:58.533 --> 59:00.400
Let me go!
You are coming with me.

59:00.402 --> 59:01.304
Run away, Indlovu! Back!

59:42.310 --> 59:43.178
Let's go.

59:48.183 --> 59:48.951
Talk to you later.

59:52.955 --> 59:55.422
Well, well, well,
who do we have here?

59:55.424 --> 59:56.957
You can't keep me here,
this is kidnapping!

59:56.959 --> 59:57.727
Let me go!

59:58.460 --> 01:00:00.930
I see you visited
us before, eh, boy?

01:00:01.395 --> 01:00:02.964
Where's that big elephant
of yours?

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.069
You'll never find him!
He's way too smart for you.

01:00:07.569 --> 01:00:09.572
[laughs]
We'll see about that.

01:00:10.305 --> 01:00:11.504
[Bafana] Boss.
Mmm.

01:00:11.506 --> 01:00:13.005
What do you want
to do with the boy?

01:00:13.007 --> 01:00:15.944
Oh, I think our fortunes
have finally changed.

01:00:16.377 --> 01:00:18.280
This boy will bring us
a huge ransom.

01:00:19.247 --> 01:00:20.015
Put him in the hut.

01:00:20.582 --> 01:00:21.917
Ah, ah, ah!

01:00:24.386 --> 01:00:26.355
You won't be needing
this any longer, boy.

01:00:27.256 --> 01:00:28.591
Go!

01:00:29.290 --> 01:00:31.227
Oh, whoa!
He's just a kid, now.

01:00:41.136 --> 01:00:42.338
[speaking other language]

01:00:44.006 --> 01:00:45.272
[door opens]

01:00:49.143 --> 01:00:49.946
Close it.

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:13.268
Yeah.

01:01:13.669 --> 01:01:16.138
I'll try that area.
Speak to you later.

01:01:17.973 --> 01:01:19.638
[clears throat]

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:23.211
Boss, are you sure
keeping the boy is wise?

01:01:23.578 --> 01:01:25.480
That boy's been
a major annoyance.

01:01:26.114 --> 01:01:29.049
[sighs] Boss, maybe we should
contact the authorities

01:01:29.051 --> 01:01:30.585
so they can take him
back to his parents.

01:01:31.053 --> 01:01:33.353
Some of the men are getting
uncomfortable, boss.

01:01:33.355 --> 01:01:34.623
Going soft on me, are you?

01:01:36.058 --> 01:01:38.494
No, boss, no.

01:01:39.428 --> 01:01:40.363
Good.

01:02:12.093 --> 01:02:12.661
Uncle Jack.

01:02:20.167 --> 01:02:21.336
No.

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:28.511
At first light, we'll continue
along the Southern Ridge.

01:02:30.444 --> 01:02:32.212
The terrain is
a bit more treacherous,

01:02:32.214 --> 01:02:34.350
so we may have
to search on foot.

01:02:34.616 --> 01:02:36.585
That's fine. I'm
prepared to do anything.

01:02:37.486 --> 01:02:39.451
The aerial searchers
have found nothing,

01:02:39.453 --> 01:02:42.290
so, yeah, we may well have
to get under the trees.

01:02:43.024 --> 01:02:44.059
Agreed.

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.595
We've been adding more men
to the other units daily.

01:02:48.529 --> 01:02:51.033
This is frustrating
for all of us, I know.

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:53.703
I can't believe he could
have gone this far.

01:02:54.602 --> 01:02:57.372
He may be going in circles.
A team might have missed him.

01:02:57.672 --> 01:02:59.108
Anything could have happened.

01:02:59.373 --> 01:03:01.343
Or maybe he made it
back home...

01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:04.611
and I'm going to get a call
saying he's safe and sound

01:03:04.613 --> 01:03:06.281
and we can all wake up
from this nightmare.

01:03:07.281 --> 01:03:09.084
I wish for that
more than anything, Sarah.

01:03:10.185 --> 01:03:11.988
Well, let's keep those
positive thoughts.

01:03:12.353 --> 01:03:13.622
It's what we need
at a time like this.

01:03:25.399 --> 01:03:26.334
[Phoenix] Indlovu?

01:03:33.107 --> 01:03:34.107
It is you, boy!

01:03:34.109 --> 01:03:35.111
[rumbling]

01:03:35.843 --> 01:03:38.146
Chain, boy.
You see the chain?

01:03:39.346 --> 01:03:40.582
Pull on the chain.

01:03:41.549 --> 01:03:43.018
[chain jangles and snaps]

01:03:43.317 --> 01:03:46.087
Good boy. Good boy.
Well done.

01:03:46.587 --> 01:03:47.622
It's amazing
how smart you are.

01:03:48.522 --> 01:03:49.491
Okay, boy, we have to go.

01:04:16.718 --> 01:04:17.719
[grunts]

01:04:30.665 --> 01:04:33.333
Was no one on guard duty?
No, boss.

01:04:33.335 --> 01:04:35.603
Only one animal could have
broken that chain.

01:04:35.837 --> 01:04:38.407
Yeah, this is not
an ordinary elephant, boss.

01:04:38.906 --> 01:04:40.776
We're going to find that boy
and that elephant.

01:04:42.243 --> 01:04:44.212
And I can see I'm going
to have to do it myself.

01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:49.385
Yes, boss.

01:04:56.825 --> 01:04:58.460
Sarah, may I talk
to you for a moment?

01:05:00.529 --> 01:05:01.430
Yes, Colonel?

01:05:02.497 --> 01:05:03.632
Have you seen Jack
this morning?

01:05:04.165 --> 01:05:06.332
No. Actually, he was
gone when I woke up.

01:05:06.334 --> 01:05:08.437
I thought maybe he'd gone to
get some water or something.

01:05:08.770 --> 01:05:11.607
Oh. He took one of the jeeps
in the night, and disappeared.

01:05:12.339 --> 01:05:13.408
Disappeared?

01:05:14.475 --> 01:05:15.643
What do you mean,
"disappeared"?

01:05:17.245 --> 01:05:18.447
I don't know what's going on.

01:05:20.848 --> 01:05:23.518
Maybe he went on ahead.

01:05:24.451 --> 01:05:27.353
No. He would have left a
note or told someone.

01:05:27.355 --> 01:05:29.592
He wouldn't just go off like that.
Right.

01:05:30.892 --> 01:05:33.525
Well, the jeep tracks
lead in that direction,

01:05:33.527 --> 01:05:36.131
so we'll follow, right away.

01:05:53.314 --> 01:05:54.716
What are we going
to do now, Indlovu?

01:05:57.652 --> 01:05:58.921
They'll never stop
looking for us now.

01:06:00.689 --> 01:06:01.754
I bet they're really mad.

01:06:01.756 --> 01:06:04.424
You need to run, okay?

01:06:04.426 --> 01:06:05.527
Run.

01:06:06.594 --> 01:06:08.527
Indlovu, run.
Just get far away.

01:06:08.529 --> 01:06:09.931
Get away from here, okay?

01:06:10.665 --> 01:06:12.301
You don't deserve any of this.

01:06:15.569 --> 01:06:16.671
I know.

01:06:18.973 --> 01:06:20.642
You won't leave
your mate and baby.

01:06:20.841 --> 01:06:22.310
You're a good dad, Indlovu.

01:06:25.312 --> 01:06:26.214
I had...

01:06:27.982 --> 01:06:29.651
I had a good dad
like you once, you know?

01:06:31.685 --> 01:06:32.954
Today we've got to hide.

01:06:33.687 --> 01:06:34.823
Try and think of a new plan.

01:06:36.357 --> 01:06:39.761
Find the police,
the army or something.

01:06:41.462 --> 01:06:43.231
Come on, boy. Let's go.

01:07:34.482 --> 01:07:37.253
Yes, boy. Good boy.

01:07:54.835 --> 01:07:56.705
[helicopter engine roars]

01:08:23.398 --> 01:08:24.399
Come on!

01:09:36.670 --> 01:09:38.740
[alarms blaring]

01:09:49.184 --> 01:09:52.520
They almost got us, boy.
They almost got us.

01:09:53.554 --> 01:09:55.788
I didn't even know
they had helicopters.

01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:57.693
It's like there's an entire
army out looking for us now.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:02.598
If only you were a chipmunk, it'd
be so much easier to hide you then.

01:10:03.564 --> 01:10:04.963
You're so huge,
you have your own zip code.

01:10:04.965 --> 01:10:06.834
[rumbles]

01:10:07.602 --> 01:10:10.139
It's just a joke, boy. I'd never
change a thing about you.

01:10:10.971 --> 01:10:12.608
Now we need
to figure out what to do.

01:10:13.207 --> 01:10:14.807
You won't leave
your mate and baby,

01:10:14.809 --> 01:10:16.412
so we've got to get them
out of there.

01:10:16.911 --> 01:10:18.046
And I have to
get back to my aunt...

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:21.082
and uncle.

01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:23.886
They must be worried sick about
me, I've been gone so long.

01:10:25.854 --> 01:10:27.523
I sure am glad
to have you to protect me.

01:10:48.076 --> 01:10:50.142
[sighs]

01:10:50.144 --> 01:10:52.712
I think we just need to recruit, like, ten
of your friends and charge in there, huh?

01:10:52.714 --> 01:10:54.082
[rumbles]
Nah.

01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:58.153
Can't do that, boy.
Guns, remember?

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.522
Guns. Well...

01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:03.492
I do have an idea...

01:11:04.893 --> 01:11:05.961
but it's risky.

01:11:13.635 --> 01:11:15.838
And just what do you think
you were doing up there?

01:11:16.037 --> 01:11:18.507
I don't want any part
in harming a boy.

01:11:18.773 --> 01:11:20.873
I had a perfect shot
at that elephant.

01:11:20.875 --> 01:11:23.042
The men are talking, boss.

01:11:23.044 --> 01:11:25.046
They want to find the herd
and move on!

01:11:25.679 --> 01:11:26.881
Fine!

01:11:28.049 --> 01:11:30.883
But your place in this
operation is in serious doubt.

01:11:30.885 --> 01:11:32.884
Now get out of my sight

01:11:32.886 --> 01:11:35.690
and go prepare the cow and the
calf for shipment tomorrow.

01:11:36.157 --> 01:11:37.626
Sure, boss.

01:12:04.786 --> 01:12:06.020
[crashing]

01:12:24.171 --> 01:12:25.640
[softly] Come on.
Hurry. Come on.

01:13:13.755 --> 01:13:14.690
Where are the men?

01:13:15.288 --> 01:13:16.858
Some of them have run away.

01:13:17.992 --> 01:13:20.796
They think the elephant
is a ghost, a devil...

01:13:21.295 --> 01:13:22.831
that can't be killed.

01:13:23.197 --> 01:13:27.069
He can be killed. all right.
He's just another elephant.

01:13:28.769 --> 01:13:29.837
I don't know, boss.

01:13:30.772 --> 01:13:32.274
I think we should
just get out of here.

01:13:32.939 --> 01:13:35.109
First, I'm going
to hunt down that elephant.

01:13:36.711 --> 01:13:37.813
What about the boy?

01:13:47.822 --> 01:13:50.759
[chuckles] You sure have
a cute baby, Indlovu.

01:13:54.062 --> 01:13:54.962
It's okay.

01:13:56.264 --> 01:13:58.100
Whoa! Never mind.
[chuckles] [trumpets]

01:14:00.468 --> 01:14:02.004
I just got you out of there.

01:14:03.371 --> 01:14:06.241
Are you just playing with me?
We can play.

01:14:08.142 --> 01:14:09.176
Hey.

01:14:11.179 --> 01:14:12.180
It's okay?

01:14:13.781 --> 01:14:14.983
What are you looking for?

01:14:15.882 --> 01:14:17.853
I don't smell
very good right now, huh?

01:14:22.355 --> 01:14:23.357
You sure are
a cute little guy.

01:14:24.192 --> 01:14:26.895
[chuckles] You're so funny.
What are you doing?

01:14:27.428 --> 01:14:29.195
No, you can't
eat that, boy.

01:14:29.197 --> 01:14:30.098
You can't eat that.

01:14:31.331 --> 01:14:33.000
Come on,
give me my clothes.

01:14:37.104 --> 01:14:38.339
What do we do now, boy?

01:14:40.407 --> 01:14:41.941
I guess you'll leave
with your family.

01:14:41.943 --> 01:14:43.745
I'm going to miss you
if you go, boy.

01:14:45.246 --> 01:14:46.214
But you should go.

01:14:47.948 --> 01:14:49.817
Those poachers will never
stop looking for you.

01:14:50.451 --> 01:14:52.120
We made a pretty great team,
didn't we, boy?

01:14:53.321 --> 01:14:55.056
We blew up their entire camp.

01:14:55.989 --> 01:14:57.823
Maybe you could take me
as far as the next village?

01:14:57.825 --> 01:14:59.361
There has to be people
out here somewhere.

01:15:00.094 --> 01:15:02.330
Okay, boy, let's go.

01:15:38.032 --> 01:15:40.736
What happened here?
It looks like a war!

01:15:41.868 --> 01:15:44.235
Something this size
has to be Von Stein's camp.

01:15:44.237 --> 01:15:46.207
Yeah, but what happened?

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:47.374
I don't know.

01:16:29.617 --> 01:16:31.419
Colonel,
you should see this.

01:16:37.524 --> 01:16:38.359
Oh, my.

01:17:25.206 --> 01:17:26.141
[chuckles]

01:17:47.127 --> 01:17:48.694
[chuckles]

01:17:48.696 --> 01:17:50.297
Wish I could take you home
and keep you.

01:17:53.134 --> 01:17:56.037
I know, boy. I know.
He's your baby.

01:17:57.138 --> 01:17:58.372
I know, boy.

01:18:00.206 --> 01:18:01.442
He's your baby.

01:18:02.410 --> 01:18:05.947
Come on. Come on. Turn right.

01:18:15.989 --> 01:18:17.255
Hold it right there, boy.

01:18:17.257 --> 01:18:19.527
Whoa! Whoa! Stop!
Indlovu, stop!

01:18:19.961 --> 01:18:22.460
Get off that elephant.
No, boy, gun. It's a gun.

01:18:22.462 --> 01:18:23.564
[trumpets]

01:18:25.398 --> 01:18:26.664
What are you going to do?

01:18:26.666 --> 01:18:29.403
I said, get off that elephant
and move away.

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:41.515
It's okay.

01:18:44.218 --> 01:18:47.354
Eh, I see I'm getting my cow
and my calf back as well.

01:18:48.121 --> 01:18:49.323
[rumbling]

01:18:59.433 --> 01:19:00.268
You better not hurt him!

01:19:00.468 --> 01:19:01.635
[trumpets]

01:19:03.304 --> 01:19:05.704
How does it feel, huh?
How do you like being scared?

01:19:05.706 --> 01:19:07.309
Don't let him do this, boy!

01:19:09.443 --> 01:19:10.645
Get him away from me, boy!

01:19:11.112 --> 01:19:12.514
Without your gun
you're nothing!

01:19:14.081 --> 01:19:15.446
[growls]

01:19:15.448 --> 01:19:17.384
Don't let him
do this, boy, please!

01:19:19.386 --> 01:19:20.587
Okay, stop, boy. Stop.

01:19:22.389 --> 01:19:23.325
Back up, boy.

01:19:25.658 --> 01:19:27.562
He's a bad man,
but you can't do this.

01:19:34.068 --> 01:19:34.970
Good boy.

01:19:36.336 --> 01:19:37.471
Good boy.

01:19:42.410 --> 01:19:43.545
Good boy.

01:19:52.185 --> 01:19:53.520
[gun cocks]

01:19:55.389 --> 01:19:58.526
It's over, Von Stein.
I'm done with you.

01:19:59.626 --> 01:20:00.694
Uncle Jack!

01:20:01.895 --> 01:20:04.596
Everything is going to be okay, Phoenix.
Stay right there.

01:20:04.598 --> 01:20:06.568
Hands behind your head, now.

01:20:07.568 --> 01:20:08.667
[Von Stein snickers]

01:20:08.669 --> 01:20:10.037
[speaking other language]

01:20:16.242 --> 01:20:18.709
[in English] They'll put you away.
You'll be finished.

01:20:18.711 --> 01:20:20.281
Let's make a duck,
you and I, right now.

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:22.617
Not this time, it is over.

01:20:23.384 --> 01:20:24.551
Way to go, Uncle Jack.

01:20:45.105 --> 01:20:46.073
Aunt Sarah!

01:20:48.742 --> 01:20:51.110
Aunt Sarah.
[gasps] Phoenix!

01:20:51.112 --> 01:20:52.781
Are you okay? Oh!

01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:55.179
We've been searching
for you for days.

01:20:55.181 --> 01:20:56.781
I thought I'd lost you too.

01:20:56.783 --> 01:20:58.816
I'm so sorry, Aunt Sarah.

01:20:58.818 --> 01:21:02.056
I got lost and then
so much happened to me.

01:21:09.596 --> 01:21:10.598
Well done, Jack.

01:21:12.198 --> 01:21:13.535
[speaking other language]

01:21:19.806 --> 01:21:21.576
Jack, we're going to need
to have a little chat.

01:21:22.408 --> 01:21:25.343
But given
what you've done here,

01:21:25.345 --> 01:21:28.715
I can persuade the magistrate
to be very lenient.

01:21:29.617 --> 01:21:30.552
Thank you, Colonel.

01:21:31.785 --> 01:21:33.220
Let's get everyone home.

01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:37.091
The main thing is
we found the boy, hmm?

01:21:40.861 --> 01:21:43.661
Ah, this must be the
young man who took down

01:21:43.663 --> 01:21:45.733
Africa's most notorious
elephant poacher.

01:21:46.267 --> 01:21:47.699
You did what?

01:21:47.701 --> 01:21:50.438
Well, it wasn't just me, sir.
Indlovu did most of it.

01:21:50.938 --> 01:21:52.306
Well, their camp is ruined.

01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:55.643
The poachers have run off
and Von Stein is in custody.

01:21:56.343 --> 01:21:59.710
Phoenix, you did all that
and trained a wild elephant?

01:21:59.712 --> 01:22:01.746
He's not wild, Aunt Sarah.

01:22:01.748 --> 01:22:03.518
He's super smart
and very friendly.

01:22:03.850 --> 01:22:05.620
Come on, you've
got to meet him.

01:22:14.327 --> 01:22:15.395
This is Indlovu.

01:22:17.831 --> 01:22:18.733
Down.

01:22:21.335 --> 01:22:22.604
Oh! Get back.

01:22:25.339 --> 01:22:27.642
Good boy. Good boy.

01:22:30.978 --> 01:22:33.781
Good boy. Good boy.
All right, up.

01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:35.414
Phoenix, is that safe?

01:22:35.416 --> 01:22:36.484
Come on up.

01:22:40.453 --> 01:22:41.589
[chuckles]

01:22:44.358 --> 01:22:45.326
Left, boy.

01:22:54.335 --> 01:22:55.336
See, it's totally fine.

01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:08.682
[laughter]

01:23:10.017 --> 01:23:11.853
See, he's totally fine.

01:23:23.330 --> 01:23:24.431
Good boy.

01:23:35.041 --> 01:23:36.343
Here's his mate and baby.

01:23:49.023 --> 01:23:50.858
[Sarah chuckles]

01:23:53.359 --> 01:23:54.495
Aw.

01:23:58.465 --> 01:23:59.400
[laughs]

01:24:01.402 --> 01:24:02.237
Come here, girl.

01:24:16.483 --> 01:24:17.485
Hey, little one.

01:24:18.551 --> 01:24:19.754
[laughs]

01:24:23.556 --> 01:24:26.493
[trumpets]
Oh! [laughs]

01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:28.862
I think she's fine.
She's just playing around.

01:24:32.532 --> 01:24:33.899
[both laughing]

01:24:33.901 --> 01:24:34.969
It's all right.

01:24:35.568 --> 01:24:36.770
You're cute.

01:24:37.904 --> 01:24:39.971
Hello, hello. Hello.

01:24:39.973 --> 01:24:41.843
[laughter]

01:24:44.411 --> 01:24:45.913
I'm glad they
looked after you.

01:24:48.581 --> 01:24:49.983
Good job. Come on.

01:24:59.526 --> 01:25:00.928
So, what happens now, Phoenix?

01:25:01.528 --> 01:25:03.861
Are you going to adopt
an entire family of elephants?

01:25:03.863 --> 01:25:06.300
Well, now that they're safe from
poachers, they can roam free again.

01:25:06.899 --> 01:25:08.066
Plus, Indlovu is
a very good dad,

01:25:08.068 --> 01:25:10.038
so he'll protect them
from anything.

01:25:11.839 --> 01:25:13.507
Truly remarkable
what you've done here.

01:25:13.741 --> 01:25:16.911
You probably saved the lives
of more than 80 elephants.

01:25:17.711 --> 01:25:20.411
Von Stein and his men were less
than 20 miles away from here.

01:25:20.413 --> 01:25:22.483
So, another day,
it would have been too late.

01:25:23.082 --> 01:25:24.951
I could not be
more proud of this boy.

01:25:26.653 --> 01:25:28.323
So there's another herd
of elephants out there?

01:25:28.621 --> 01:25:30.755
Oh, yeah.

01:25:30.757 --> 01:25:32.524
I wouldn't be surprised if these
elephants are part of that herd.

01:25:32.526 --> 01:25:33.560
They'll catch up.

01:25:34.694 --> 01:25:36.898
You hear that, boy? Your
herd is not far from here.

01:25:37.898 --> 01:25:39.030
Can you find them?

01:25:39.032 --> 01:25:40.668
[rumbles]

01:25:43.470 --> 01:25:44.939
I guess it's time
for you to go then, boy.

01:25:49.977 --> 01:25:50.912
Guess I'll...

01:25:53.746 --> 01:25:54.948
I'll never see you again.

01:25:55.715 --> 01:25:56.883
I'm going to miss you
so much, boy.

01:25:57.818 --> 01:25:59.987
[rumbles]

01:26:01.889 --> 01:26:02.989
[snickers]

01:26:06.492 --> 01:26:08.994
Now it's time to go back.
Be with your own kind.

01:26:08.996 --> 01:26:11.366
I want you to always
be a good dad, okay?

01:26:11.732 --> 01:26:13.501
Take care of that
little baby of yours.

01:26:14.468 --> 01:26:16.037
You have such
a nice family, Indlovu.

01:26:17.037 --> 01:26:18.973
There's one more important
thing I have to tell you.

01:26:22.675 --> 01:26:23.710
I love you, boy.

01:26:27.947 --> 01:26:28.915
I love you.
