00:01.668 --> 00:08.133
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.217 --> 00:11.845
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>Good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.929 --> 00:14.848
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:14.932 --> 00:18.227
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.310 --> 00:21.522
<i>Lucky there's a man who positively can do</i>

00:21.605 --> 00:23.148
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.232 --> 00:24.608
<i>Laugh and cry!</i>

00:24.691 --> 00:30.113
<i>He's a family guy!</i>

00:35.994 --> 00:37.037
Where are you going?

00:37.120 --> 00:39.581
I'm going to Quagmire's
to get some hand-me-downs.

00:39.665 --> 00:42.084
His dad-mom sent over
some boxes of men's clothes

00:42.167 --> 00:44.336
from back before
the ol' chippety-choppety.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.755
Ugh. You shouldn't wear
people's old, dirty clothes.

00:46.839 --> 00:48.257
Well, I'm a dirty guy, Lois.

00:48.340 --> 00:51.760
Haven't you ever seen my naughty,
late-night, party-line commercials?

00:51.844 --> 00:53.971
Hey, are you lonely?

00:54.054 --> 00:56.807
Do you like to party with hot girls?

00:56.890 --> 01:00.185
What about horsing around with fat guys?

01:00.269 --> 01:02.354
Well, what are you waiting for?

01:02.437 --> 01:03.814
Give us a call.

01:03.897 --> 01:07.276
I'll be on the toilet,
wearing a T-shirt that's so long

01:07.359 --> 01:10.404
I have to hold it under my chin
while I wipe.

01:15.158 --> 01:18.704
Wow, your dad doesn't
use this dickie anymore?

01:18.787 --> 01:19.830
That's crazy.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.499
Why would anyone
get rid of a perfectly good dickie?

01:22.583 --> 01:24.585
I see what you're doing, and cut it out.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.170
Hey, what are these?

01:28.172 --> 01:30.591
Oh, my God, I haven't seen these in years!

01:30.674 --> 01:33.260
What do you got there?
Some kind of home movie from the Orient?

01:33.343 --> 01:34.845
No, no, this is <i>Winter Summer.</i>

01:34.928 --> 01:37.014
It was a Korean soap opera that I was in.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.724
You were in a Korean soap opera?

01:38.807 --> 01:41.226
Yeah, back when the Navy
had me stationed in Busan,

01:41.310 --> 01:43.687
I saw an ad in the paper
for guys over five-foot-four,

01:43.770 --> 01:45.189
and I was the only one who showed up.

01:45.272 --> 01:48.358
Next thing I know, I'm on TV,
playing a guy named American Johnny.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.569
Wow, I didn't even know you could act.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.487
You also didn't know
I was a rock polisher.

01:52.571 --> 01:53.655
Take a look at that.

01:53.739 --> 01:55.574
Oh, my! What is that?

01:55.657 --> 01:56.909
That's tiger eye.

01:56.992 --> 01:58.744
Extraordinary.

02:35.447 --> 02:36.990
Holy crap, Quagmire, you speak Korean?

02:37.074 --> 02:38.575
Nah, not really.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.494
They just told me how to sound
the words out phonetically.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.955
So you never knew what
you were actually saying?

02:43.038 --> 02:44.998
No. In fact, at the height of the show,

02:45.082 --> 02:49.294
I did a whole pro-genital-mutilation PSA
that I really regret.

02:49.378 --> 02:51.630
- Wow, that girl's hot.
- That's a guy.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.590
- That other guy's handsome.
- That's a girl.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.300
- That cat is cute.
- That's a dog.

02:55.384 --> 02:57.094
What is everything?

02:59.054 --> 03:03.684
Oh, my God, if Hee-Sun and Bong-Hwa
don't get together, I'm gonna kill myself!

03:03.767 --> 03:06.728
You're crazy!
Bong-Hwa is completely dishonorable!

03:06.812 --> 03:09.481
He brought a personal item to work!

03:24.788 --> 03:26.331
- Oh, my God!
- No way!

03:26.415 --> 03:28.166
I told you! I told you!

03:28.250 --> 03:31.503
Wow, I guess he didn't die
in the vending machine.

03:37.676 --> 03:38.844
What? It's over?

03:38.927 --> 03:41.555
- Should we put in the next one?
- Of course we should.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.348
We are binge-watching this whole show.

03:43.432 --> 03:46.351
I mean, I haven't been this into something
since <i>The Shawshank Redemption.</i>

03:46.435 --> 03:49.229
Yes, um, after you escaped into the hole,

03:49.313 --> 03:52.191
how did you perfectly re-attach
the Raquel Welch poster

03:52.274 --> 03:55.652
from inside the hole with a tautness
that a rock could pierce?

03:55.736 --> 03:56.945
Does it really matter?

03:57.029 --> 03:58.030
It does to me.

03:58.113 --> 03:59.531
Did you even like the movie?

03:59.615 --> 04:01.617
I did very much up until that point.

04:45.911 --> 04:47.454
Oh, my God!

04:47.538 --> 04:49.414
Quagmire, give me the last tape!

04:49.498 --> 04:52.000
Huh. Sorry, guys. There are no more tapes.

04:52.084 --> 04:54.086
What? Where's the last one?

04:54.169 --> 04:55.170
He's right.

04:55.254 --> 04:56.964
Oh, my God! What do we do?

04:57.047 --> 04:58.465
Quagmire, tell us what happened!

04:58.549 --> 05:00.175
Did Hee-Sun live to have the baby?

05:00.259 --> 05:02.469
Did Kim secure a position
at the hydroelectric plant?

05:02.553 --> 05:04.137
I don't know. I don't remember.

05:04.221 --> 05:05.681
How can you not remember?

05:05.764 --> 05:07.933
It was 20 years ago. We shot out of order.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.935
I-I never even knew what I was saying.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.603
I didn't care. I was living the life.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.814
Just banging chicks
and eating cabbage, you know.

05:13.897 --> 05:16.358
Aw, crap, what do we do about our show?

05:16.441 --> 05:19.027
Now I know how that German
movie producer felt.

05:19.111 --> 05:21.822
All right, Friedrich,
now that World War II is over,

05:21.905 --> 05:23.991
we can get back to making comedies again.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.951
Get me these comedy writers.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.787
Uh... I don't think
any of these guys are available.

05:28.871 --> 05:31.582
What? This is terrible! Get me my agent!

05:31.665 --> 05:34.626
He's, uh, he's probably
not gonna answer either.

05:34.710 --> 05:36.128
Well, this is crazy! What happened...

05:36.211 --> 05:38.630
Oh, I remember what happened.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.596
That episode's not online anywhere.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.223
I even tried the Korean
search engine Bing Bong.

05:48.307 --> 05:49.308
That's not real.

05:49.391 --> 05:51.935
All right, it's not, but, Quagmire,
we need that episode.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.353
We got to know what happened!

05:53.437 --> 05:57.065
Guys, I'm sorry, but it was years ago,
and it never aired outside Korea.

05:58.192 --> 06:00.277
So, we go to Korea.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.486
- Yes.
- Buying tickets.

06:01.570 --> 06:04.615
Come on, guys,
it's just a dumb, forgotten TV show.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.534
Quagmire, we have to know
how <i>Winter Summer</i> ends.

06:07.618 --> 06:09.578
This show is our whole life now.

06:09.661 --> 06:12.039
Yeah, if we don't find that tape,
we're screwed.

06:12.122 --> 06:15.042
Like anybody who goes
scuba diving with Dave Navarro.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.194
All right, gang,
me and the guys are off to Korea

06:42.277 --> 06:45.113
to find the last episode of a soap opera
Quagmire was in.

06:45.197 --> 06:48.992
Peter, this is ridiculous.
Wh-What am I supposed to do if work calls?

06:49.076 --> 06:50.118
Just do what I do.

06:50.202 --> 06:52.788
Hold the phone up
to any episode of <i>Who's the Boss?</i>

06:52.871 --> 06:55.874
Griffin, it's been four days.
Why haven't you come to work?

06:55.958 --> 06:58.293
- <i>Angela?</i>
- Of course it's me!

06:58.377 --> 07:00.587
You know,
I've got half a mind to fire you.

07:00.671 --> 07:01.964
<i>Angela.</i>

07:02.047 --> 07:04.591
Oh, I can't stay mad at you.

07:04.675 --> 07:06.760
I'll see you when I see you.

07:06.844 --> 07:08.762
<i>Olé, olé, olé!</i>

07:08.846 --> 07:11.431
<i>Oh, missing Korea</i>

07:11.515 --> 07:15.227
<i>Oh, missing Korea</i>

07:15.310 --> 07:18.605
<i>Oh, missing Korea</i>

07:18.689 --> 07:22.276
<i>Uh-olé, olé</i>

07:26.280 --> 07:29.074
Man, EPCOT nailed Asia.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.952
American Johnny!

07:35.789 --> 07:37.708
Oh! American Johnny!
American Johnny!

07:37.791 --> 07:40.460
Holy crap, Quagmire, you're famous here!

07:40.544 --> 07:43.338
- It's American Johnny!
- American Johnny is back!

07:43.422 --> 07:46.216
I take a picture with giant Samsung phone!

07:46.300 --> 07:49.803
Giant Samsung phone is also tiny Kia car!

08:00.772 --> 08:02.482
- American Johnny!
- American Johnny!

08:02.566 --> 08:04.693
Welcome, American Johnny.

08:04.776 --> 08:07.070
We give only best room for you.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.489
Would you like smoking or chain smoking?

08:09.573 --> 08:11.533
Uh, smoking, I guess?

08:11.617 --> 08:15.829
Yes, and how many ridiculous things
would you like your toilet to do?

08:15.913 --> 08:18.332
Do you have one that goes,
"Yum-yum-yum-yum-yum"?

08:18.415 --> 08:20.751
Ah, presidential suite!

08:25.589 --> 08:27.508
Well, Donna's mother died.

08:27.591 --> 08:29.593
But we should probably head out to find

08:29.676 --> 08:31.803
the last episode
of that Korean soap opera.

08:31.887 --> 08:34.556
- Yeah. Where's Peter?
- Oh, he went to get plastic surgery.

08:34.640 --> 08:35.641
He did?

08:35.724 --> 08:37.976
Yeah, Korea's the plastic surgery
capital of the world.

08:38.060 --> 08:39.436
Nobody here thinks you look good

08:39.520 --> 08:42.397
unless you have big, round eyes
and a tiny little nose and chin.

08:42.481 --> 08:44.858
- Hey, guys.
- Peter, are you all right?

08:44.942 --> 08:46.485
You know what? I feel good.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.695
I feel like I want to giggle
behind my hand

08:48.779 --> 08:52.449
at a lot of things and hold, but not eat,
a big ice cream cone.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.498
There were more birds
than videos in there.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.458
Yeah, and no sign of <i>Winter Summer.</i>

09:01.542 --> 09:02.668
Glenn?

09:02.751 --> 09:04.002
Glenn Quagmire?

09:05.712 --> 09:06.713
Sujin?

09:13.470 --> 09:15.806
It's Hee-Sun! From the show!

09:15.889 --> 09:17.891
- I don't believe it.
- She's so beautiful.

09:17.975 --> 09:19.685
She's so beautiful!

09:19.768 --> 09:21.186
H-How did you find me?

09:21.270 --> 09:23.188
I heard that American Johnny was back,

09:23.272 --> 09:27.067
so I started following you
on the new "Where American Johnny?" app.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.986
I already rich from that.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.654
Dance for me, Hilary Duff!

09:34.324 --> 09:36.410
Ah, it's so great to see you, Sujin.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.120
You look just as pretty as ever.

09:38.203 --> 09:41.373
I've waited every day
hoping you would return.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.625
And I never stopped thinking of you.

09:43.709 --> 09:46.837
Were you guys... Involved?

09:46.920 --> 09:49.590
- We were, Peter.
- Korean O-M-G!

09:49.673 --> 09:53.051
Sujin, we actually came here to find
the last episode of <i>Winter Summer.</i>

09:53.135 --> 09:55.137
- Would you happen to have it?
- Of course.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.931
-Can we see it?
- Why, yes. Tonight.

09:58.015 --> 10:00.392
Glenn, you and your friends
must come to my home

10:00.475 --> 10:01.935
for gross Korean dinner.

10:02.019 --> 10:04.897
Man, look at them.
They make such a cute couple.

10:04.980 --> 10:07.191
Like Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man.

10:17.326 --> 10:19.578
I'm so happy
you all could make it tonight.

10:19.661 --> 10:22.331
We will have many things
you will nibble at and not eat.

10:22.414 --> 10:25.042
- Then I will give you a pizza.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's great.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.419
Hey, can we watch that last episode
of <i>Winter Summer</i> now?

10:27.503 --> 10:29.463
We will watch together after dinner.

10:29.546 --> 10:32.633
In the meantime,
feel free to watch Korean pop videos.

10:36.178 --> 10:37.888
<i>...chocolate, chocolate...</i>

10:45.896 --> 10:49.483
What is this, and how can I make
the rest of my life about it?

10:49.566 --> 10:51.235
Dinner will be ready soon.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.320
But, Glenn, I have a surprise for you.

10:53.403 --> 10:54.905
Do you remember Buttercup?

10:54.988 --> 10:56.198
Who's Buttercup?

10:57.699 --> 11:01.078
Oh, my God,
I can't believe Buttercup is still alive!

11:01.161 --> 11:02.621
Alive and well.

11:02.704 --> 11:05.207
Wait a minute, you named a cat Buttercup?

11:06.542 --> 11:08.252
Only Quagmire.

11:08.335 --> 11:12.256
And you know, Glenn, after you moved away,
Buttercup had kittens.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.674
What?

11:13.757 --> 11:16.009
That's right. You're a grandfather.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.304
My God.

11:19.388 --> 11:22.307
This is more pussy than even I can handle.

11:22.391 --> 11:24.268
<i>Is he gonna say "giggity"?</i>

11:24.351 --> 11:25.853
<i>Should I say "giggity"?</i>

11:25.936 --> 11:28.689
<i>Are other people</i><i>allowed to say "giggity"?</i>

11:28.772 --> 11:29.815
Giggity.

11:29.898 --> 11:32.150
- What?
- Nothing. It's stupid.

11:37.781 --> 11:39.908
Ah, that was a great dinner, Sujin.

11:39.992 --> 11:41.451
I've missed you so much.

11:41.535 --> 11:44.204
I'd forgotten
how happy we make each other.

11:44.288 --> 11:47.791
Okay, I'm done with this sweet rice water
that has a pine nut floating in it.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.126
Nice dessert, by the way.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.670
- Can we watch the thing now?
- Of course. Here it is...

11:51.753 --> 11:54.464
The last episode of <i>Winter Summer.</i>

11:54.548 --> 11:57.676
Oh, my God!
This is everything I've dreamed of.

11:57.759 --> 12:00.512
Well, this, and becoming
a half-man, half-horse.

12:00.596 --> 12:02.598
Give up these legs?

12:02.681 --> 12:04.308
Don't be absurd.

12:33.295 --> 12:34.713
Why?

12:34.796 --> 12:37.508
Why would American Johnny leave Korea?

12:37.591 --> 12:38.842
He had everything!

12:38.926 --> 12:40.719
Love! A family!

12:40.802 --> 12:44.848
Why would he go back to his sad,
pathetic bachelor life in America?

12:44.932 --> 12:46.517
He's got nothing there!

12:46.600 --> 12:49.102
Why would he ever want to go home?

12:49.186 --> 12:50.729
Okay, Quagmire, let's go home.

12:51.897 --> 12:54.316
Well, you know what? You're right, Peter.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.360
American Johnny never should've left.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.487
It was the only time he was ever happy.

12:58.570 --> 12:59.947
What? What are you saying?

13:00.030 --> 13:03.158
Hey, "Sin-ju,"
your TV says it's 21 o'clock.

13:03.242 --> 13:04.743
What is that in real time?

13:04.826 --> 13:07.371
I'm saying I'm not going back to Quahog.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.455
What?

13:08.539 --> 13:12.042
But we've-we've seen the last episode.
We did what we came here to do.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.127
Peter, everything you just said is true.

13:14.211 --> 13:16.421
I don't have anyone
waiting for me in Quahog.

13:16.505 --> 13:18.382
But here, I've got Sujin.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.509
I've got Buttercup and our grandcats.

13:20.592 --> 13:21.802
I've got a family.

13:21.885 --> 13:25.138
I'm not gonna make the same mistake
American Johnny did.

13:25.222 --> 13:26.682
I'm staying here.

13:26.765 --> 13:30.352
<i>Will Quagmire stay in Korea?</i>

13:30.435 --> 13:32.604
<i>Will Peter find a new friend?</i>

13:32.688 --> 13:35.232
<i>Find out after this Korean commercial</i>

13:35.315 --> 13:39.361
<i>Ashton Kutcher</i><i>thought</i>
<i>no one in America</i><i>would ever see.</i>

13:39.444 --> 13:41.572
Hi. I'm Ashton Kutcher.

13:41.655 --> 13:44.199
Have you ever killed a dog
while driving drunk,

13:44.283 --> 13:47.536
and then been upset
that there was no way for your car engine

13:47.619 --> 13:50.038
to cook it for you
on the rest of the drive home?

13:50.122 --> 13:51.707
Well, those days are over,

13:51.790 --> 13:54.793
thanks to
Dr. Lee's Pet Engine Cooking Bag.

13:54.877 --> 13:58.422
Just put the dog in the bag,
place it over the engine block,

13:58.505 --> 14:01.800
and drive your usual 20 miles per hour
over the speed limit.

14:03.969 --> 14:06.346
Mmm. Bow-wow!

14:06.430 --> 14:08.223
I'm Ashton Kutcher, and remember,

14:08.307 --> 14:12.394
Dr. Lee's Pet Engine Cooking Bags
are not meant for babies.

14:12.477 --> 14:14.438
But they can be used for babies.

14:23.405 --> 14:27.326
Quagmire, you can't stay in Korea.
We all got lives back in Quahog.

14:27.409 --> 14:29.411
That's just it, Peter. You have lives.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.496
You guys all have wives and kids.

14:31.580 --> 14:34.249
And I have nothing
waiting for me back there.

14:34.333 --> 14:36.043
But here, I have a family.

14:36.126 --> 14:38.003
Plus, commercial pilots around here

14:38.086 --> 14:40.297
can just fly their plane into the ocean
if they want.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.174
Peter's right.
We can't just leave you here.

14:42.257 --> 14:43.967
Who am I gonna get
all my wiener jokes from?

14:44.051 --> 14:45.302
You're my wiener guy.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.637
Joe, I got them from a book.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.430
I wish I didn't know that.

14:48.514 --> 14:50.641
Don't peek behind the curtain, huh?

14:50.724 --> 14:53.060
Sorry, guys,
you're not gonna change my mind.

14:53.143 --> 14:55.854
I just feel like I belong here with Sujin.

14:58.774 --> 15:00.025
What are you gonna do?

15:00.108 --> 15:02.319
It's a powerful thing
when a woman pays you

15:02.402 --> 15:04.279
even the slightest bit of attention.

15:04.363 --> 15:06.240
Yeah, God knows I've been there.

15:06.323 --> 15:07.491
Welcome to Chili's.

15:07.574 --> 15:08.742
We're through.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.376
Can't believe Quagmire
isn't coming back with us.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.378
Donna's mother? It was suicide.

15:19.461 --> 15:21.922
You guys want to check out
Brazil while we're out?

15:22.005 --> 15:24.883
We just got to accept
that Quagmire has made his decision.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.552
There's nothing we can do about it.

15:26.635 --> 15:29.972
Yeah, I guess
as far as Quagmire's concerned,

15:30.055 --> 15:31.598
he's totally Korean now.

15:46.655 --> 15:50.492
Guys, there's only one way
to get through to a Korean.

15:50.576 --> 15:52.494
Through their music.

15:52.578 --> 15:54.204
Uh-huh. Yeah.

15:54.288 --> 15:55.998
We can try your thing.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.963
Eh, another show about a lizard.

16:03.046 --> 16:05.632
Quagmire, you're making a mistake.

16:05.716 --> 16:08.093
- Quahog is where you belong.
- That's right.

16:08.177 --> 16:12.139
And if you won't listen to us,
maybe you'll listen to, um... Us.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.265
But singing.

16:17.186 --> 16:18.187
Quagmire!

16:20.439 --> 16:21.565
Quagmire!

16:21.648 --> 16:23.442
<i>Heh-heh heh-heh-heh</i>

16:23.525 --> 16:24.818
<i>Ooo!</i>

16:26.111 --> 16:29.740
<i>Your new romance</i>
<i>Has you lost in an Asian trance</i>

16:29.823 --> 16:33.118
<i>So we're breakin' the spell</i>
<i>With a K-pop dance</i>

16:33.202 --> 16:35.078
<i>Ooo-oo-oo-oo-hoo</i>

16:35.162 --> 16:36.455
<i>In our booty pants</i>

16:36.538 --> 16:37.998
<i>Ooo-oo-oo-oo-hoo</i>

16:39.249 --> 16:42.878
<i>Everything in this land</i>
<i>Is complete nonsense</i>

16:42.961 --> 16:46.256
<i>Even worse, Kim Jong-un</i>
<i>Lives across that fence</i>

16:46.340 --> 16:47.841
<i>Ooo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo</i>

16:47.925 --> 16:49.801
<i>Come home, where you belong</i>

16:49.885 --> 16:51.386
<i>Quahog is your home</i>

16:51.470 --> 16:52.763
<i>Quagmire</i>

16:52.846 --> 16:56.058
<i>- Who wants to live in Korea?</i>
<i>- Come home</i>

16:56.141 --> 16:59.311
<i>- Their name sounds like gonorrhea</i>
<i>- Quahog</i>

16:59.394 --> 17:02.231
<i>So, Quagmire, please tell 'em "See ya"</i>

17:02.314 --> 17:05.025
<i>Come on, come on, come on home</i>
<i>Quahog is your home</i>

17:05.108 --> 17:06.318
<i>Boy</i>

17:07.569 --> 17:09.154
<i>Whiskey, steaks and giant bongs</i>

17:09.238 --> 17:10.739
<i>Ricki Lake and Howie Long</i>

17:10.822 --> 17:12.449
<i>Giant boobies, firm and strong</i>

17:12.533 --> 17:16.495
<i>Not here, only in the U.S.A., hey</i>

17:16.578 --> 17:17.829
<i>Come on home today</i>

17:17.913 --> 17:19.373
<i>Ooo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo</i>

17:20.624 --> 17:22.459
Confusing dance break!

17:25.295 --> 17:27.172
Random names of snacks now!

17:28.173 --> 17:29.174
Candy!

17:29.883 --> 17:30.968
Quahog!

17:31.051 --> 17:33.011
Marshmallow!

17:33.095 --> 17:35.055
Candy! Quahog! Marshmallow!

17:37.516 --> 17:40.811
<i>- You only belong in Quahog</i>
<i>- Come home</i>

17:40.894 --> 17:44.064
<i>You really love pussy, they eat dog</i>

17:44.147 --> 17:46.942
<i>So, buddy, please run, don't jog and</i>

17:47.025 --> 17:49.736
<i>Come on, come on, come on home</i>
<i>Quahog is your home</i>

17:49.820 --> 17:50.821
<i>Boy</i>

17:50.904 --> 17:53.949
<i>Heh-heh-heh-heh, heh-heh-heh, ooo!</i>

17:54.032 --> 17:57.035
<i>Heh, heh-heh, heh, heh-heh, heh, heh</i>

17:57.119 --> 17:59.329
<i>Heh-heh-heh, heh-heh-heh-heh</i>

17:59.413 --> 18:00.414
<i>Ooo!</i>

18:04.376 --> 18:05.460
Sorry, guys.

18:05.544 --> 18:08.046
I know those New York Giants jerseys
weren't cheap,

18:08.130 --> 18:10.132
but I'm staying here, and that's final.

18:17.890 --> 18:20.767
Well, I pressed our matching
beige pantsuits for tomorrow.

18:21.852 --> 18:23.061
Good night.

18:23.145 --> 18:24.438
Aah!

18:26.773 --> 18:28.984
- Who's that?
- This is my grandfather.

18:29.067 --> 18:31.695
He is going to live with us,
in the Asian tradition.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.656
So will the rest of my aunts,
uncles and cousins.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.201
They will?

18:37.284 --> 18:39.703
Of course. And have you met Great-Grandma?

18:40.329 --> 18:42.080
I can see through her!

18:42.164 --> 18:43.707
I-Is she a ghost?

18:43.790 --> 18:46.126
We don't know. She won't answer.

18:46.210 --> 18:49.254
Tomorrow, you take her to town
to buy root vegetable.

18:49.338 --> 18:51.715
After that,
you will get psychopath haircut

18:51.798 --> 18:53.675
so you look like one of us.

18:54.843 --> 18:58.180
What's the matter, Glenn?
You don't seem completely emotionless.

18:58.263 --> 19:01.099
No, no, no, no, I am, I am.
I'm emotionless.

19:01.892 --> 19:03.310
Good night, Glenn.

19:03.393 --> 19:07.773
Oh, and just so you know,
three of my cousins have night terrors.

19:14.905 --> 19:16.156
Oh, no!

19:23.455 --> 19:25.666
It's crazy we're going home
without Quagmire.

19:25.749 --> 19:27.417
What are we gonna do without him?

19:27.501 --> 19:30.212
Rent his house to a sorority,
enjoy the babes?

19:30.295 --> 19:31.380
Huh.

19:35.509 --> 19:37.302
Goodbye, Quagmire.

19:37.386 --> 19:39.012
We're gonna miss you, buddy.

19:40.264 --> 19:41.890
Guys, wait!

19:43.433 --> 19:46.061
<i>Who wants to live in Korea?</i>

19:46.144 --> 19:49.398
<i>Their name sounds like gonorrhea</i>

19:49.481 --> 19:50.983
Candy!

19:51.775 --> 19:52.943
Quahog!

19:53.026 --> 19:54.528
Marshmallow!

19:55.112 --> 19:57.239
Candy! Quahog! Marshmallow!

19:59.491 --> 20:01.243
What I'm trying to say is...

20:01.326 --> 20:03.620
Guys, I'm coming back to Quahog with you.

20:03.704 --> 20:04.788
You are?

20:04.872 --> 20:05.998
Oh, that's great!

20:06.081 --> 20:09.042
But wait, won't that upset Sujin
and your new Korean family?

20:09.126 --> 20:11.587
What, are you kidding?
They all got to be in a K-pop song.

20:11.670 --> 20:13.130
That's all anyone here wants.

20:13.213 --> 20:16.633
Look, Great-Grandma is so happy,
she finally died and became a ghost.

20:24.892 --> 20:27.394
Thanks again for convincing me
to come home, guys.

20:27.477 --> 20:28.979
No problem, Quagmire.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.607
Looks like Donna's mother's funeral
went well.

20:31.690 --> 20:35.402
Odd choice to have an open casket
for a gunshot suicide.

20:35.485 --> 20:37.154
Yep, I thought I wanted a family,

20:37.237 --> 20:39.406
but I love having
no responsibilities here.

20:39.489 --> 20:41.825
I can get drunk whenever,
sleep with anyone,

20:41.909 --> 20:44.870
and just hide in my house
and avoid the world if I feel like it.

20:44.953 --> 20:45.996
Wow, that's great,

20:46.079 --> 20:49.291
and totally doesn't sound
like symptoms of clinical depression.

20:49.374 --> 20:52.085
I heard you gentleman went to South Korea.

20:52.169 --> 20:53.795
- Yeah.
- Well, that's cool.

20:53.879 --> 20:56.006
We went to Lake Havasu, you losers!

20:56.089 --> 20:58.800
We nabbed so much college beav!
