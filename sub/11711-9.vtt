Only the artist
knows.

18:31.026 --> 18:31.777
Okay, people.

18:31.777 --> 18:35.030
Let's do this quickly
before security comes.

18:35.531 --> 18:36.907
[CLAPS]
This is so exciting.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.867
You know, I know
we're not related,

18:38.867 --> 18:40.244
but whenever we are together,

18:40.244 --> 18:42.746
it really feels like...
MAN: One, two, three.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.540
...you're my mother.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.167
[SCREAMING]

18:46.167 --> 18:48.377
No! No, no.

18:48.377 --> 18:49.670
Mommy.

18:49.670 --> 18:52.131
[♪♪♪♪♪♪]

18:56.092 --> 18:57.803
Hey.
Hey.

18:58.429 --> 18:59.763
I'm sorry.

18:59.763 --> 19:01.473
Hm. Me too.

19:02.766 --> 19:05.394
Oh, you smell good.
What is that?

19:05.394 --> 19:06.895
Aluminum.

19:06.895 --> 19:07.479
Thank you.

19:07.479 --> 19:10.232
So you still wanna get
married with a piece of paper

19:10.232 --> 19:12.609
and clothing and stuff, right?
Yes.

19:12.609 --> 19:14.445
I don't agree with everything
my mom thinks,

19:14.445 --> 19:17.113
but I still love her,
'cause she's my mom.

19:17.113 --> 19:19.115
You know, I should, uh...

19:19.115 --> 19:20.201
be more understanding

19:20.201 --> 19:21.785
and accept her
the way she is.

19:21.785 --> 19:22.869
Oh, she'll grow on you.

19:22.869 --> 19:25.997
Like those mushrooms she used
to keep on the windowsill

19:25.997 --> 19:27.999
and wouldn't
let me eat.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.794
Oh...God.

19:30.794 --> 19:33.088
Now that was
a good ending.

19:33.088 --> 19:36.091
I wonder
what's on next.

19:36.425 --> 19:39.345
Eh, that boring
elevator show.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.805
You know, we should
full on get a telescope.

19:41.805 --> 19:43.432
That high-rise across
the way,

19:43.432 --> 19:46.727
that would be like
100 different stations.

19:48.019 --> 19:50.814
Didn't I tell you we could
have fun without TV?

19:50.814 --> 19:53.817
Yeah. We could've even
made it as a couple

19:53.817 --> 19:55.902
back in the golden age
of radio.

19:55.902 --> 19:56.945
[SCOFFS]

19:56.945 --> 19:59.240
Oh, thank
the good Lord.

19:59.240 --> 20:02.993
AUDREY:
So, what do you want to do
the rest of the night?

20:02.993 --> 20:04.035
Well, uh...

20:04.035 --> 20:05.871
satellite's
still out.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.499
So we might
as well have sex.

20:08.499 --> 20:08.999
Oh.

20:08.999 --> 20:11.084
There's gotta be
something else we can do.

20:11.084 --> 20:14.963
Play Monopoly.
Oh, let's go.

20:14.963 --> 20:17.258
[♪♪♪♪♪♪]

20:19.801 --> 20:20.552
Oh, hey,
here it is.

20:20.552 --> 20:23.805
REPORTER [ON TV]:
With me is avant-garde
photographer Bruno.

20:23.805 --> 20:26.308
Bruno, what does
your latest work symbolize?

20:26.308 --> 20:28.810
Well, it says so many things.
But I think

20:28.810 --> 20:31.272
what it really
symbolizes is

20:31.272 --> 20:35.776
the conformity
of modern...

20:36.318 --> 20:37.986
something.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.407
I knew that was it!

20:41.407 --> 20:42.491
That's what I said.

20:42.491 --> 20:45.286
Anyway, I don't think
I can look at...

20:45.286 --> 20:46.495
your mom

20:46.495 --> 20:47.496
as my mom anymore.

20:47.496 --> 20:51.333
Oh, just 'cause you saw her
naked, you lost the feelings?

20:51.333 --> 20:54.002
Oh, I still have feelings.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.380
They're just in a...

20:56.380 --> 20:58.173
new category.

20:59.174 --> 21:01.051
Don't. Okay. Do not.

21:01.051 --> 21:04.638
Train's already left
the station, buddy.
