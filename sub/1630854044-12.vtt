-It's coming from my gut!

that we just put in
one bed this time.

[scoffs] That's fair.

11:20.222 --> 11:24.099
Actually, my campaign
is starting now.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.435
And I'm definitely
not playing fair.

11:29.815 --> 11:31.231
[soft music playing]

11:34.361 --> 11:36.736
-You rang?
-Blue?

11:36.813 --> 11:38.530
What were you doing
hiding in there, man?

11:38.532 --> 11:40.448
Come here. [grunts]

11:40.450 --> 11:43.034
-[laughs]
-Are you happy to see me?

11:43.036 --> 11:44.744
[hums]

11:44.821 --> 11:46.746
[chuckling]

11:46.748 --> 11:48.498
I missed you so much, man.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.334
[Blue] Oh, I missed you too.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.294
You're definitely
not playing fair.

11:53.371 --> 11:54.796
Man, it's good
to see you, boy.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.260
So this is it.

12:00.262 --> 12:02.721
-What you think of
our new home, son?
-It's cool.

12:03.598 --> 12:05.348
-I like it a lot.
-You do?

12:06.184 --> 12:07.475
Even though it's smaller
than the farm?

12:07.477 --> 12:09.644
It's big enough for us.

12:09.646 --> 12:14.232
-Grandma's house is so big
I get lost in it sometimes.
-[chuckles]

12:14.234 --> 12:17.360
Like, I'm on the second floor.
She's on the first floor.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.779
Granddad is in the office
above the--

12:19.781 --> 12:22.073
They have a three-car garage,

12:22.075 --> 12:23.616
but they only have two cars.

12:23.618 --> 12:25.827
You know what they say
about different strokes.

12:25.829 --> 12:27.454
Different strokes
for different folks.

12:28.165 --> 12:30.415
-[chuckling]
-[Blue] Right.

12:32.377 --> 12:33.710
What's this doing here?

12:36.590 --> 12:37.505
Reminding me of home.

12:38.175 --> 12:40.258
And you.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.926
You know, if you ever want
to talk to us, you can, right?

12:44.723 --> 12:46.723
Oh, can you measure me?

12:46.725 --> 12:49.184
-That's a good idea. Come on.
-[Darla] That's a great idea.

12:49.260 --> 12:51.728

-Everything.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.399
-For real.
-[chuckles]

13:38.401 --> 13:39.651
[phone vibrating]

13:40.445 --> 13:42.111
[sighs] Sorry.

13:46.284 --> 13:47.492
[laughs]

13:48.954 --> 13:50.370
Who has you smiling?

13:50.372 --> 13:53.414
I'm waiting on a call
from the studio museum.

13:53.416 --> 13:56.751
-[Keke] Mmm-hmm.
-I met a curator there
and sent some of my work.

13:56.753 --> 14:00.004
-So you loved it there?
-I did, yeah.

14:00.882 --> 14:04.968
New York was eye-opening,
you know?

14:04.970 --> 14:07.428
I mean, it's not like
I haven't been there before,
'cause I definitely have,

14:07.430 --> 14:11.057
but something
about this trip was just...

14:12.602 --> 14:14.060
I don't know.
It hit different.

14:14.896 --> 14:16.729
The vibe, the people.

14:17.774 --> 14:18.940
It kind of felt like home.

14:19.901 --> 14:21.401
Or what I want
home to feel like.

14:24.823 --> 14:26.406
Sounds like you have
something to say

14:26.482 --> 14:28.575
and the Keke I know
don't bite her tongue, so...

14:28.577 --> 14:31.661
It's just this is what you do.

14:31.663 --> 14:34.831
Ever since I've met you,
you're always looking
for the next thing.

14:34.833 --> 14:37.000
No, it's not like that.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.960
I went to New York
because I was looking

14:38.962 --> 14:41.504
to secure an investment
for our collective here.

14:41.506 --> 14:43.882
Like, LA is my parents' city.

14:43.884 --> 14:47.886
Like, I grew up there,
but it was their way of life.

14:47.888 --> 14:51.347
It's not necessarily
the way of life
I would choose for myself.

14:51.349 --> 14:54.183
And I took that trip to Paris
for the summer
and that was cool,

14:54.185 --> 14:57.020
but again,
something was missing.

14:57.063 --> 15:02.734
And New Orleans is beautiful
and comfortable

15:02.736 --> 15:04.235
and amazing and magical,

15:04.237 --> 15:08.031
but I'm trying to step
outside of my comfort zone.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.618
That's exactly what I felt
when I went to New York.

15:12.329 --> 15:13.828
Just in the best way.

15:15.749 --> 15:16.956
Then, that's where
you should be.

15:20.045 --> 15:21.494
I think so too.

15:22.839 --> 15:26.132
Plus, I can work
on the collective
from anywhere.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.218
Just dreaming.

15:30.347 --> 15:32.513
Dream away. [giggling]

15:35.352 --> 15:37.435
-[Prosper] What do you think?
-I mean, I love it.

15:37.812 --> 15:39.896
Sandy has great taste.

15:39.898 --> 15:42.231
[Prosper]
Yeah, I'm still trying to
get used to it myself.

15:43.985 --> 15:46.736
See, I don't know
how you put up with
all my crap for so long.

15:46.738 --> 15:49.030
Well you know,
it has a certain charm.

15:50.325 --> 15:52.200
But what I can't believe
is that she let you keep

15:52.276 --> 15:53.826
that old raggedy chair
of yours.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.662
-Watch that!
-[Billie wheezing]

15:55.738 --> 15:57.705
If this chair could talk,
it'd have stories.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.916
It ain't going nowhere
until I do.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.109
[Billie] Okay, well then,
do you know what?

16:02.111 --> 16:04.379
I hope it stays around
for years to come then.

16:04.381 --> 16:05.630
-[Prosper] Thank you.
-Okay.

16:05.707 --> 16:07.548
[both chuckle]

16:07.625 --> 16:12.679
Oh, uh, now that Dominic
is back over at Nova's,

16:12.714 --> 16:14.555
you are welcome to stay here
if you want. No problem.

16:15.684 --> 16:17.809
Thank you, daddy,
but I'm moving back to Chicago

16:17.811 --> 16:24.023
as soon as this whole
Laundry land business is in
a better shape for the co-op.

16:24.100 --> 16:26.651
Shouldn't be too much longer.
Maybe a couple weeks.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.027
Mmm, sure you ready to go?

16:29.406 --> 16:30.405
I am.

16:31.282 --> 16:32.532
I mean, coming here has...

16:33.535 --> 16:35.243
...has changed so much.

16:36.204 --> 16:38.121
Me and you being
most important.

16:39.207 --> 16:40.623
I feel the same.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.917
I mean, it really has
been wonderful, Daddy.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.585
-I mean...
-Really.

16:44.587 --> 16:47.046
Yeah, well, I wouldn't
have met Sandy

16:47.048 --> 16:48.965
if it hadn't been for you.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.675
-Meddling. [chuckling]
-I mean...

16:50.752 --> 16:52.343
Making me have a nurse.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.928
I mean, facts!

16:54.431 --> 16:56.097
[laughing]

16:59.436 --> 17:00.601
I'm gonna miss you.

17:07.610 --> 17:09.110
You know, we've been
through a lot.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.322
I'm gonna miss you,
too, Daddy.

17:17.078 --> 17:20.788
His niece was teaching
your kids CRT.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.874
-[crowd murmuring]
-I mean, he's not
even a parent.

17:22.950 --> 17:26.377
So now he's gonna be
in charge of brainwashing
your kids.

17:26.379 --> 17:27.712
[crowd applauding]

17:32.761 --> 17:34.719
Well, unlike my opponent here

17:34.721 --> 17:36.429
who's just running
his mouth...

17:36.431 --> 17:38.097
[crowd chuckling]

17:39.601 --> 17:41.726
...I'm doing something to make
it better for your kids.

17:43.271 --> 17:45.021
I'm here for more than just

17:45.065 --> 17:46.773
a drop and pick a child up.

17:47.484 --> 17:50.151
I started Dads On Patrol

17:50.228 --> 17:51.527
to help all of you out.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.405
And I see your kids.

17:54.482 --> 17:55.656
They're struggling.

17:56.534 --> 17:58.301
Scared.

17:58.303 --> 18:00.536
Trying to make sense
of a world where they
have no control.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.581
So, I volunteer my time away

18:03.583 --> 18:05.333
from my businesses
in this community,

18:05.335 --> 18:07.543
my own place, the Real Spot,

18:07.545 --> 18:09.087
my beautiful
wife's restaurant,

18:09.089 --> 18:11.005
Vi's Prized Pies and Diner.

18:11.007 --> 18:13.382
-[applause]
-That'll do it. Tell her!

18:13.426 --> 18:16.135
I volunteer my time
because I care.

18:17.180 --> 18:19.472
And contrary
to popular belief,

18:19.474 --> 18:21.265
caring is not just a domain

18:21.342 --> 18:22.934
of a biological parent,

18:22.936 --> 18:26.604
it's the domain
of every human being

18:26.606 --> 18:28.648
who wants to better
their community,

18:28.650 --> 18:29.732
our community.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.275
[applause]

18:31.277 --> 18:33.486
So, how are you gonna
educate our kids?

18:33.563 --> 18:35.696
[chuckling] You didn't
even finish high school.

18:36.199 --> 18:37.406
[crowd murmuring]

18:40.120 --> 18:41.035
All right, he's not lying.

18:42.664 --> 18:44.122
School wasn't easy for me.

18:45.166 --> 18:47.208
Everything was okay
till I got to high school...

18:48.169 --> 18:49.368
...then I fell behind...

18:50.463 --> 18:53.339
...and I was too ashamed
to ask for help...

18:54.717 --> 18:56.300
...and nobody noticed
I struggled.

18:57.220 --> 18:59.595
So, when my
mother got laid off...

19:00.598 --> 19:03.266
...I told her that
I would get a job.

19:03.309 --> 19:06.018
Now, she didn't know that
I was gonna be working
full-time,

19:06.095 --> 19:09.147
but when she found out,
boy, she was hotter than
fish grease.

19:09.223 --> 19:11.107
[laughing]

19:12.902 --> 19:15.570
So, by the time
graduation rolled around,

19:15.572 --> 19:17.530
nobody even noticed
I didn't even show up.

19:18.533 --> 19:20.074
I fell through the cracks,

19:20.151 --> 19:21.993
and that's what I see
with these kids.

19:21.995 --> 19:25.288
They are falling through
the cracks just like me,

19:25.290 --> 19:27.165
and there's nobody
there to catch them.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.501
But me and my wife...

19:31.379 --> 19:32.545
...we wanna be there.

19:33.381 --> 19:37.133
We just found out
that we were approved

19:37.135 --> 19:40.178
to become foster parents.

19:40.254 --> 19:42.221
So we wanna help out
as many kids as needed.

19:42.223 --> 19:44.557
And that is why

19:44.559 --> 19:46.601
I am running
for the school board.

19:47.812 --> 19:49.729
I want to make a difference.

19:49.764 --> 19:51.171
Or at least try.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.444
So, thank you for considering
giving me your vote.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.113
My name is
Hollywood Desonier...

20:00.742 --> 20:02.742
...and to me,
all kids are a star.

20:02.744 --> 20:03.951
[applause]

20:09.834 --> 20:11.292
[cheering]

20:13.963 --> 20:14.921
[mouthing]

20:14.997 --> 20:16.964
[mouthing]

20:22.472 --> 20:24.263
[Darla] You don't need
to wear your hard hat, Blue.
Nothing's up yet.

20:24.265 --> 20:26.641
[Blue] I like it. Makes me
feel in charge.

20:26.717 --> 20:28.226
Don't need no hat for that.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.437
That's where
the cane goes, right?

20:31.439 --> 20:33.606
-[Ralph] It goes in on top.
-[Darla] Mmm-hmm.

20:33.683 --> 20:36.484
And then it gets chopped
up and turns into sugar.

20:36.486 --> 20:39.195
Then the juice is
extracted and boiled.

20:39.197 --> 20:42.406
I did a science fair project
on processing sugar.

20:42.483 --> 20:45.868
Most kids in D.C. have no idea
where their food comes from.

20:46.788 --> 20:48.913
Spoken like a true Bordelon.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.998
You know you got sugar
cane in your blood, right?

20:51.167 --> 20:52.583
Perfect amount.

20:52.660 --> 20:54.669
[Blue] That's what I tell
my friends. I like farming.

20:54.671 --> 20:56.754
We have a garden at Sidwell

20:56.756 --> 20:59.382
Mrs. Obama started when Sasha
and Malia were there,

20:59.384 --> 21:02.260
but really small
compared to ours, Pops.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.764
I'm gonna go check
out the part numbers.

21:08.518 --> 21:10.268
See, he's fine.

21:10.344 --> 21:11.769
When he's with us.

21:12.563 --> 21:14.021
I'm worried about
when he's away.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.191
You worry too much.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.369
Purple?

21:28.371 --> 21:30.162
Baby, what if the kid
don't even like purple?

21:30.239 --> 21:32.164
That is not plain old purple,

21:32.166 --> 21:34.292
that is electric violet.

21:34.294 --> 21:35.793
It's for the accent wall.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.044
Well, it's a bold choice.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.130
Everybody loves violet.

21:40.425 --> 21:41.716
I know I do.

21:41.718 --> 21:42.800
[chuckling]

21:43.511 --> 21:44.760
Oh, okay.

21:44.762 --> 21:47.513
You know,
I just wish I knew if,

21:47.515 --> 21:50.099
you know, we were preparing
for a girl or a boy

21:50.101 --> 21:51.809
or knew anything about them.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.687
In fact, baby, are they
gonna tell us

21:54.764 --> 21:56.647
why the child
is in foster care?

21:56.649 --> 21:58.316
You know?

21:58.318 --> 22:00.818
Are we gonna know
anything about what
they've been through?

22:00.895 --> 22:02.945
I don't know, baby.

22:02.989 --> 22:05.906
We're just gonna take it
one day at a time, okay?

22:07.493 --> 22:08.409
Well, I guess you're right.

22:08.411 --> 22:09.327
[chuckling]

22:09.403 --> 22:10.494
I hear you.

22:11.497 --> 22:14.123
Hollywood... [chuckling]

22:14.125 --> 22:17.043
-...I keep thinking about
you in that debate.
-[chuckling]

22:17.119 --> 22:19.920
That man did not
know what hit him.

22:19.997 --> 22:22.381
Ah, baby, I did my best.

22:22.383 --> 22:24.717
I just said what I felt
and just spoke the truth.

22:25.011 --> 22:26.418
Now we'll see what happens.

22:26.420 --> 22:29.263
Yeah, well, whatever happens,
I'm so proud of you.

22:29.340 --> 22:31.307
Baby, look around...

22:32.435 --> 22:34.060
...I'm proud of us.

22:36.272 --> 22:37.229
[chuckling]

22:53.164 --> 22:54.705
Place is a time capsule.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.040
[Dominic] Did you spend
a lot of time here?

22:56.042 --> 22:58.501
[Nova] I guess I was here
a lot when I was little,

22:58.544 --> 23:02.421
and, uh, I know this
may sound weird,

23:02.423 --> 23:05.091
but I dreamt about this
place my whole life.

23:05.093 --> 23:06.967
I wasn't always sure
if it was real

23:06.969 --> 23:08.928
or if I made it up, but...

23:09.806 --> 23:11.204
...it felt like home.

23:13.976 --> 23:16.894
I come from a long line
of women, powerful women.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.120
Mmm.

23:20.858 --> 23:22.400
I felt that in you
the minute I met you.

23:27.198 --> 23:29.740
Oh, she really put space

23:29.742 --> 23:31.450
between her and the rest
of the world.

23:32.370 --> 23:34.078
Well, it wasn't all by choice,

23:34.155 --> 23:36.997
uh, all the women
in my family have a gift.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.583
But her father
saw it as a curse

23:39.585 --> 23:40.918
and sent her away.

23:43.881 --> 23:45.131
Did she ever confront
him about it?

23:46.008 --> 23:47.299
No.

23:47.301 --> 23:49.343
He died when she was in Haiti,

23:49.420 --> 23:51.137
but she said he visited
her in her dreams

23:51.764 --> 23:52.888
and they made peace.

23:55.476 --> 23:56.600
Does Ernest come to you?

23:58.980 --> 23:59.895
He does.

24:00.773 --> 24:01.730
Sometimes.

24:02.817 --> 24:03.691
And my mother.

24:08.072 --> 24:09.029
See?

24:10.575 --> 24:12.199
She was writing her story.

24:13.411 --> 24:15.119
The story of this land...

24:15.997 --> 24:16.996
...the house.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.708
This is Trudy's room.

24:21.836 --> 24:23.185
That's my mother.

24:24.213 --> 24:27.131
Martha says, "Trudy's room
gets the best light.

24:28.384 --> 24:30.134
You have to come
to this room...

24:31.095 --> 24:32.011
...when you're ready."

24:58.414 --> 24:59.413
I guess...

25:00.249 --> 25:01.332
...guess I'm not ready.

25:14.597 --> 25:15.930
This collective is gonna work.

25:15.932 --> 25:18.766
It is, we're gonna
revolutionize web three.

25:18.768 --> 25:21.060
Shame it needs
revolutionizing.

25:21.136 --> 25:22.436
And it's just starting.

25:23.397 --> 25:25.147
But white supremacy
works fast.

25:25.149 --> 25:27.691
Well, we're gonna move faster.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.193
[chuckles]

25:30.613 --> 25:31.695
They emailed me.

25:32.657 --> 25:34.198
What was that?

25:34.200 --> 25:36.158
It's just one of the responses
I've been waiting on.

25:36.494 --> 25:37.943
One that I really want.

25:39.747 --> 25:42.414
And it's the law enforcement
accountability project.

25:42.416 --> 25:44.291
They match artists
with projects

25:44.293 --> 25:45.960
that amplify
police aggression.

25:45.962 --> 25:47.628
That's perfect for you.

25:47.705 --> 25:48.771
I know.

25:48.773 --> 25:51.298
Um, what are we
waiting for? Move.

25:52.176 --> 25:53.217
[computer beep]

25:53.636 --> 25:56.262
"Micah, I'm thrilled to share

25:56.264 --> 25:59.515
that on the merits of your
grassroot activism

25:59.517 --> 26:01.850
and your current art practice,

26:01.852 --> 26:04.270
we'd like to invite you
to accept the position

26:04.346 --> 26:06.480
of East Coast
Artist Coordinator

26:06.557 --> 26:09.358
-for the law enforcement
accountability project."
-Are you serious?

26:10.403 --> 26:12.152
-Micah!
-I got a job?

26:13.823 --> 26:15.030
I have a job!

26:15.032 --> 26:16.699
[laughing]

26:18.911 --> 26:20.119
A good job!

26:20.195 --> 26:21.912
-Yes!
-An important one.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.499
You did! And in New York.

26:29.046 --> 26:32.172
Remember prom night when we
were stuck in that hotel

26:32.174 --> 26:35.050
and everybody was talking
about their dream job?

26:35.094 --> 26:37.011
Yeah, I remember that.

26:37.013 --> 26:40.806
You said you would end
up in something "respectable"

26:40.808 --> 26:41.765
like a hedge fund.

26:41.767 --> 26:42.975
[chuckling]

26:42.977 --> 26:45.394
But you didn't.

26:47.189 --> 26:49.898
You blew off Harvard

26:49.900 --> 26:52.401
and stayed here
because it was right for you.

26:53.654 --> 26:55.195
New York is right for you.

26:55.656 --> 26:57.489
You're gonna do big things.

26:57.491 --> 26:59.617
It's just a huge
decision, like, I gotta...

27:00.786 --> 27:02.703
...I can't rush into it,
I got school...

27:03.581 --> 27:05.331
...family,
you and the collective.

27:05.333 --> 27:06.624
Don't worry about us.

27:07.209 --> 27:08.292
We all here.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.628
I'll hold her down.

27:10.630 --> 27:14.131
A collective success
doesn't always have
to fall on one person.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.175
And you can do it
from New York.

27:16.251 --> 27:18.344
My parents are gonna
freak out if I drop out.

27:19.096 --> 27:22.097
You're parents want
you to be happy.

27:22.099 --> 27:23.599
No, they want me
to make them happy.

27:25.478 --> 27:26.727
I don't believe that.

27:27.605 --> 27:29.438
My entire life they've
told me I can...

27:30.274 --> 27:33.359
...do anything,
I can be anything,

27:33.361 --> 27:36.236
just within their
idea of success.

27:36.313 --> 27:38.113
Maybe you misread that.

27:39.033 --> 27:40.407
Either way, it's your life,

27:40.409 --> 27:43.535
and if you want it,
convince them.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.239
[chuckling]

27:54.048 --> 27:55.506
You know, I would have
been really lost...

27:56.967 --> 27:59.677
...when I came to New Orleans
if I hadn't met you.

27:59.753 --> 28:02.262
Remember that when I need
a place to stay in New York.

28:02.264 --> 28:03.222
[laughing]

28:03.224 --> 28:04.765
I'm serious, I'm serious.

28:07.228 --> 28:08.894
I really came
into my own here,

28:08.896 --> 28:10.521
and you had so
much to do with that.

28:12.441 --> 28:15.401
It's like you are
New Orleans to me.

28:42.096 --> 28:44.805
He used to put his hat
on my head so I couldn't
see anything.

28:46.016 --> 28:47.391
He did that to me
when I was little, too.

28:50.396 --> 28:51.729
I miss Pops.

28:52.314 --> 28:53.522
[Blue] I miss Papa, too.

28:55.526 --> 28:57.526
Where do you think
we go when we die?

28:59.488 --> 29:00.612
That's a tough question.

29:02.199 --> 29:03.298
We live on.

29:03.993 --> 29:05.701
In people's hearts
that love us most.

29:06.996 --> 29:08.162
That's all we can do.

29:12.793 --> 29:13.792
[phone ringing]

29:17.006 --> 29:18.279
Mr. Prosper.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.509
Wait, slow down, you said
Cardale said what?

29:26.974 --> 29:29.183
What's going on, Mr. Prosper?

29:29.185 --> 29:31.894
Never thought I'd be happy
to see someone get evicted,

29:31.896 --> 29:32.936
but he deserves it.

29:34.064 --> 29:35.689
Who deserves
something so horrible?

29:35.766 --> 29:37.441
[Billie Denton] Landry.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.318
[Sam Landry] Is this
necessary? Do you really
have to do this?

29:39.904 --> 29:41.336
Look, you know,

29:41.338 --> 29:42.488
you know this is all
just a big misunderstanding?

29:42.564 --> 29:44.031
Never thought
I'd see this day.

29:44.992 --> 29:46.492
Didn't come soon enough.

29:47.203 --> 29:48.994
He got away with so much.

29:49.497 --> 29:50.996
For way too long.

29:50.998 --> 29:52.790
My daddy would
love to see this.

29:52.792 --> 29:55.292
Hmm, yeah, well,

29:55.369 --> 29:56.877
he's looking down on it
right now and loving it.

29:56.879 --> 29:58.186
That's right.

29:58.188 --> 30:00.964
You know they're gonna
auction of his land.

30:00.966 --> 30:02.424
My land right
in the middle of it.

30:03.093 --> 30:04.051
Ralph...

30:05.054 --> 30:05.928
...we will get it back.

30:07.056 --> 30:08.222
Don't give up hope.

30:09.975 --> 30:11.058
Hey, Landry!

30:13.229 --> 30:14.536
What are you doing?

30:14.538 --> 30:16.814
Want him to see who
exposed him to the USDA.

30:18.943 --> 30:20.943
That was the Borderlons

30:20.945 --> 30:22.945
and the black farmers
from St. Joe.

30:23.447 --> 30:25.072
We did that!

30:40.130 --> 30:42.506
[lady in background]
Hi, Dr. Barnes, how are you?

30:43.968 --> 30:45.592
[Dr. Barnes in background]
Thank you, thank you so much.

30:46.887 --> 30:48.095
Man of the hour.

30:48.514 --> 30:49.847
[laughing]

30:49.849 --> 30:50.889
How are you doing?

30:50.891 --> 30:53.642
Hey, new must be
Wifi's girlfriend?

30:53.644 --> 30:55.077
Wifi?

30:55.079 --> 30:56.669
[Dr. Barnes] Whole time
we were in the dessert,

30:56.671 --> 30:59.523
all he's thinking about
is finding wifi so he can
call you.

30:59.600 --> 31:00.816
Oh!

31:00.818 --> 31:02.401
Hmm. [chuckling]

31:02.403 --> 31:04.361
Giving away all my secrets?

31:04.363 --> 31:06.864
Wonderful to meet you,
Miss Bordelon.

31:06.866 --> 31:07.948
Thank you for hosting us.

31:07.950 --> 31:09.199
It's my pleasure.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.535
This is Dr. Barnes,
he's our program chair.

31:11.537 --> 31:12.786
At least he is
for a few more months.

31:12.788 --> 31:14.997
He's one of the few
Black archaeologists

31:14.999 --> 31:17.666
who chairs a university
program and is basically
my hero.

31:18.294 --> 31:19.359
[chuckling]

31:20.045 --> 31:21.503
Something I wanna
talk to you about.

31:21.547 --> 31:22.880
Yeah, certainly.

31:22.882 --> 31:24.590
It's not public yet,

31:24.592 --> 31:27.926
but Tulane University

31:27.928 --> 31:31.847
has been chosen to participate
in an international delegation

31:31.849 --> 31:34.683
for a landmark dig

31:34.685 --> 31:37.144
in Bamako, Mali.

31:37.220 --> 31:40.063
Congratulations!
That is massive.

31:40.691 --> 31:41.940
I'd like you to lead it.

31:45.154 --> 31:46.612
[stuttering]

31:48.949 --> 31:51.116
Uh, thank you,
Dr. Barnes, I...

31:51.994 --> 31:53.535
...I, are you sure?

31:53.537 --> 31:54.786
I mean, this is your dream.

31:54.788 --> 31:56.705
Our dreams shine brighter

31:56.749 --> 31:59.458
when they're stepping
stones for others.

31:59.460 --> 32:01.710
It's your turn, young man.

32:03.088 --> 32:04.296
[stuttering]

32:07.092 --> 32:09.426
I... I... Thank you.

32:10.137 --> 32:11.803
I don't know what to say.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.431
The dig will start
end of spring,

32:14.433 --> 32:17.309
16 months in a cradle
of civilization.

32:17.386 --> 32:18.435
You earned it.

32:19.104 --> 32:20.562
I can think of no one better

32:20.564 --> 32:23.315
to represent me
and our university.

32:24.443 --> 32:25.817
Think about that.

32:36.330 --> 32:38.455
I don't wanna be away
from you that long again.

32:39.083 --> 32:40.958
Not so soon, not like this.

32:41.034 --> 32:42.125
But...

32:43.212 --> 32:46.630
...this is everything
you've wanted.

32:46.632 --> 32:49.216
Everything you've been working
toward your whole career.

32:49.218 --> 32:50.968
This is it!

32:51.044 --> 32:54.221
Yeah, I know, but I don't
wanna do it without you,
though, Nova.

32:54.297 --> 32:55.430
I don't, like...

32:57.893 --> 32:59.101
Would you come with me?

32:59.144 --> 33:00.227
Would you...

33:01.605 --> 33:02.813
Would you move
to Africa with me?

33:02.815 --> 33:04.398
[stuttering] Whatever this is,

33:04.400 --> 33:07.234
I wanna experience it together
with my love, with my...

33:07.987 --> 33:09.302
...my best friend.

33:09.379 --> 33:11.613
You're one of my favorite
people in the world.

33:12.825 --> 33:14.324
You're one of my
favorites, too.

33:15.869 --> 33:18.996
But Dominic, this is your
destiny not mine.

33:18.998 --> 33:20.998
This is your path
and you have to follow it.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.791
My path leads here.

33:34.096 --> 33:35.721
You changed my life.

33:37.266 --> 33:38.265
I feel the same.

<i> was accused of bribing</i>
<i> local USDA officials.</i>

34:51.882 --> 34:54.883
<i> The land seizure is set</i>
<i> for auction this week.</i>

34:54.927 --> 34:58.970
<i> One of the largest</i>
<i> asset seizures</i>
<i> in Louisiana history...</i>

34:58.972 --> 35:00.889
[Parthena] I wouldn't
wish that on my worst enemy.

35:02.518 --> 35:04.392
All that land.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.603
[Billie] Most of it's stolen
from black farmers.

35:06.605 --> 35:09.189
It's the only piece
that matters to me.

35:09.191 --> 35:11.566
Might as well just
auction off my daddy.

35:11.610 --> 35:14.361
Look, we have Nova's
advance money

35:14.437 --> 35:17.280
and everyone in the co-op
is willing to pitch in.

35:17.282 --> 35:19.007
Same as they did for Parthena.

35:19.009 --> 35:21.618
Yeah, well, all our money
together couldn't
help out Parthena.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.703
She got less land
than Landry got.

35:23.705 --> 35:26.081
Look, all these companies
and people,

35:26.125 --> 35:28.208
they coming out
the wood works
for this property.

35:28.210 --> 35:32.212
Uh, I don't wanna cause
an alarm, but I just heard

35:32.214 --> 35:34.214
from Hugh over at
the hardware store.

35:35.134 --> 35:37.592
Sam's not going down
without a fight.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.262
Now he's calling in old favors

35:40.264 --> 35:42.806
and his friends
are talking about
showing up at the auction.

35:42.808 --> 35:45.809
Win or lose, we have to try.

35:45.811 --> 35:48.353
All his friends
got deep pockets.

35:48.355 --> 35:52.691
They have deep pockets
but I know folks here
with bigger hearts.

35:54.069 --> 35:56.278
But hey, y'all. Listen up.

35:57.406 --> 36:00.490
Now, y'all seen the news,
you know what's going on.

36:00.492 --> 36:04.369
All right? Now we
have to band together
to help Ralph Angel.

36:04.371 --> 36:06.955
-[woman] Mmm-hmm.
-[Prosper] He and his family,
they've come through for us.

36:06.957 --> 36:09.624
Now it's time for us
to come through for them.

36:09.626 --> 36:13.003
All right, now they're
gonna auction off
his land in two days.

36:13.005 --> 36:14.629
So, every little bit helps.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.549
Okay? Please.

36:17.551 --> 36:21.678
[indistinct murmuring]

36:28.353 --> 36:30.896
If it comes down to a fight,
we're right there with you.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.523
Thank you, Mr. Prosper.

36:38.280 --> 36:41.323
Like you always told me,
one step at a time.

36:44.328 --> 36:47.454
So, you know,
I was in New York

36:47.456 --> 36:52.209
and I met with an investor,
Grandma knows her,
but this is not about her.

36:52.586 --> 36:54.127
I just...

36:55.672 --> 36:56.955
[Charley] <i> What's</i>
<i> going on, Micah?</i>

36:56.957 --> 36:59.549
Mom, I got a job offer
while I was in New York.

36:59.551 --> 37:03.428
-So, plan is to drop out
of Xavier...
-[Charley] <i> What?</i>

37:03.505 --> 37:06.681
...and start
a new chapter there.

37:06.683 --> 37:08.749
[Charley sighs] <i> Micah,</i>
<i> you're starting to make</i>

37:08.751 --> 37:11.102
<i> choices that you'll</i>
<i> have to live with</i>
<i> for the rest of your life.</i>

37:11.104 --> 37:12.604
<i> -Are you, are you even</i>
<i> thinking about that?</i>
-Mom, Mom, Mom.

37:12.606 --> 37:14.046
You don't get it.

37:14.048 --> 37:18.568
I have never felt more sure
about anything, ever.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.096
[Charley] <i> I don't know</i>
<i> what to say.</i>

37:22.098 --> 37:26.493
This is the part
where you say,
"Congratulations, Micah."

37:27.162 --> 37:28.787
"I knew you could do it."

37:28.789 --> 37:30.872
[Charley] <i> I just</i>
<i> don't know anymore.</i>

37:30.874 --> 37:32.707
I just thought you'd
be happy for me.

37:33.293 --> 37:35.252
Everyone else is.

37:35.254 --> 37:38.838
This is a great opportunity
for me to explore,
to move forward in my life.

37:38.915 --> 37:41.174
[Charley] <i> Think about</i>
<i> your future.</i>

37:41.176 --> 37:43.134
<i> You could have talked</i>
<i> to us first before you went-</i>

37:43.211 --> 37:44.719
I'm not asking
for your permission.

37:46.473 --> 37:47.672
I'm an adult.

37:49.351 --> 37:51.226
You just insist on
treating me like a kid.

37:51.228 --> 37:53.019
[Charley] <i> Then stop</i>
<i> acting like one!</i>

37:53.021 --> 37:55.188
I'm not act--
You're not even
listening to me.

37:55.190 --> 37:58.233
Like, I'm not going to
New York to just live there.

37:58.277 --> 38:00.944
This is exactly what I've been
working for.

38:00.946 --> 38:03.196
This is exactly what
I wanna do with
the rest of my life.

38:03.273 --> 38:06.199
Make art, make community.

38:06.201 --> 38:09.619
Have a job, I'm gonna have
access to so many people

38:09.696 --> 38:12.622
who actually see me
for who I am.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.608
I have to be there.

38:15.610 --> 38:17.919
[Charley] <i> Well, we'll talk</i>
<i> more later. I gotta go, bye</i>

38:33.979 --> 38:36.313
Now, this room
is better, right?

38:36.315 --> 38:39.983
I mean, it's closer.
That way, if they need us,
we can hear 'em.

38:40.060 --> 38:43.028
And I tell you, baby, this,
this electric violet,

38:43.030 --> 38:45.363
it's the right choice,
baby, you nailed it.

38:45.365 --> 38:46.364
You think they'll like it?

38:46.700 --> 38:48.325
We can always repaint.

38:49.328 --> 38:52.203
I thought we would have
gotten the call by now.

38:52.280 --> 38:54.456
Do you think that
there's a problem?

38:54.458 --> 38:57.417
I think our baby will
come right on time.

38:57.919 --> 38:58.960
I don't know.

38:59.629 --> 39:00.879
[sighs]

39:02.132 --> 39:04.049
I mean, maybe our time
has passed.

39:04.468 --> 39:05.792
You know?

39:05.794 --> 39:08.511
Maybe this, this isn't
the right thing to do.

39:08.588 --> 39:10.889
I am not a young woman.

39:10.891 --> 39:13.975
You, Violet Bordelon,
are timeless.

39:13.977 --> 39:16.061
-I'm serious.
-And so am I.

39:18.607 --> 39:21.191
You can imagine me,
a baby and me?

39:21.193 --> 39:23.568
With parents that
are barely Micah's age?

39:23.570 --> 39:26.988
I could see any child
being lucky calling you Mama.

39:26.990 --> 39:29.824
Do you think Belinda
has changed her mind?

39:29.826 --> 39:31.493
Just need to be patient, baby.

39:31.995 --> 39:33.203
Just a little bit.

39:40.253 --> 39:42.295
[Nova gasps] Miss Pearl.

39:46.593 --> 39:49.010
[Pearl] So pleased
that you came back.

39:50.263 --> 39:52.430
Say prayers for
Miss Martha's journey.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.599
She was a good woman.

39:55.602 --> 39:57.602
She deserves this.

40:02.275 --> 40:04.609
Ladies, shall we begin?

40:05.195 --> 40:06.820
-Yes.
-[woman murmuring]

40:19.251 --> 40:24.295
We ask in the name
of our beloved
Martha Lavoisier.

40:25.924 --> 40:29.134
That as her soul
separates from her body,

40:29.136 --> 40:32.220
she be granted peace.

40:32.889 --> 40:35.306
May her homegoing
path be clear

40:35.308 --> 40:39.894
and her journey be filled
with euphoric joy.

40:39.896 --> 40:44.357
May our hearts
be strengthened.

40:44.359 --> 40:48.987
We know and believe
that while absent in mind,
she is present in spirit

40:48.989 --> 40:54.033
and in spirit she is mighty.
