02:00.934 --> 02:03.630
I'm an artist, and I won't change
a word of my play...

02:03.703 --> 02:05.762
to pander to some commercial
Broadway audience!

02:05.839 --> 02:08.933
I'm not arguing with you!
Do you see me arguing?

02:09.008 --> 02:12.638
Your play is great as is. It's real.
It makes a point. It's confrontational.

02:12.712 --> 02:16.170
- Then why won't you produce it?
- Because I cannot afford
another failure.

02:16.416 --> 02:19.510
- David, the play's too heavy.
- But not everybody writes to distract.

02:19.586 --> 02:22.419
- It's the theater's duty
not just to entertain...

02:22.489 --> 02:24.980
- but to transform men's souls.
- Oh, come on.

02:25.058 --> 02:28.459
You're not at one of your sidewalk cafes
in Greenwich Village. This is Broadway.

02:28.528 --> 02:31.224
- You said you believed in my play!
- What do you want me to say?

02:31.465 --> 02:34.730
I'm tapped out. Maybe if we got some
big-time director interested...

02:34.801 --> 02:37.998
- I could scare up backers--
- No, no, no. I'm directing this play.

02:38.071 --> 02:41.131
Ohh, will you listen to this guy?
Where's your track record?

02:41.208 --> 02:43.904
I won't see my work mangled again.
I've been through this twice before.

02:43.977 --> 02:46.912
Two powerful scripts,
could have been tremendous successes...

02:46.980 --> 02:51.508
and I had to watch actors change
my dialogue and directors
misinterpret everything!

02:51.585 --> 02:53.519
I know. I know.
You're an artist.

02:53.587 --> 02:58.524
Let me tell you, kid, that's the
real world out there, and it's
a lot rougher than you think.

03:12.539 --> 03:15.838
What are you waitin' for?
Kill them!

03:17.844 --> 03:19.971
Come on. Let's go
get somethin' to eat.

03:20.046 --> 03:22.981
- I feel like eatin' ribs.
- That's a good idea.

03:23.049 --> 03:27.577
I gotta go shoot crap at Tommy's. He's
got a game at the Ansonia. I gotta go.

03:27.654 --> 03:31.249
Somebody's got to let
Mr. Valenti know what's going on.
He's at the Three Deuces.

03:31.491 --> 03:35.018
- Why don't you go tell him?
- I promised Bobby Doyle.
I can't do nothin'.

03:35.095 --> 03:40.055
- I gotta shoot a game.
- What's a matter, Cheech? Don't
you wanna baby-sit his girl?

03:40.100 --> 03:42.193
His girlfriend's
a pain in my ass.

04:00.887 --> 04:03.788
- Here, doll, take care of this hat.

04:03.857 --> 04:07.054
- Mr. V. here?
- Yeah, right this way.

04:07.127 --> 04:11.086
-Nice crowd.
-Yeah, we're packin' 'em in every night.

04:11.164 --> 04:15.328
- Right here.

04:23.610 --> 04:27.706
- Done.
- Now that's a load
off my mind. How many?

04:27.781 --> 04:31.217
- Four.
- This means we ain't heard the last.

04:31.284 --> 04:34.913
You know Kustabeck's gonna have a fit,
but he'll run scared.

04:34.955 --> 04:37.753
- Maybe.
- Listen, a deal's a deal.

04:37.824 --> 04:43.126
- We got midtown. I mean, eh...
Mr. Valenti does.

05:05.619 --> 05:07.917
Not at all.

05:10.757 --> 05:13.817
I'm fed up!
I'm fed up, do you hear me?

05:13.893 --> 05:18.091
You can push your torpedoes around all
you want, but I've had it up to here!

05:18.164 --> 05:20.962
- What is it now?
- I am not sharing a dressing room.

05:21.001 --> 05:25.836
I am tired of getting
bumped into and stepped on.
None of these bimbos knows how to dance.

05:25.872 --> 05:28.636
- Bimbos!
- They're the best line in New York.

05:28.708 --> 05:30.835
- Bullshit! Bullshit!
- Oh, knock it off.

05:30.910 --> 05:33.378
- Hey, clam up over there.
Olive, come on.
- What?

05:33.613 --> 05:36.605
- Olive, it's our anniversary.
- It's not our anniversary.

05:36.683 --> 05:39.117
-You're getting senile.
-It's September 28. Six months to today.

05:39.185 --> 05:41.119
- So?
- I remember it like it was yesterday...

05:41.187 --> 05:43.883
'cause that's the morning
we broke Joey Benjamin's legs.

05:43.957 --> 05:46.653
- Six months? Six months!
- Yeah. Six months.

05:46.693 --> 05:50.789
- And I'm still stuck
in this crummy rat trap!
- Olive. I brought you somethin'.

05:50.864 --> 05:52.661
- What is it?
- Open it.

05:52.699 --> 05:56.897
- No, you open it.
Can't you see I'm dressing?
- I'll open it. Here. Hey.

05:56.970 --> 05:59.905
- What is it?
- Pearls! What the hell
do you think they are?

05:59.939 --> 06:02.066
- Pearls are white.
- These are black pearls.

06:02.142 --> 06:05.942
Don't give me that!
I never heard of black pearls.

06:06.012 --> 06:08.640
Just 'cause you never heard of somethin'
don't mean it don't exist.

06:08.715 --> 06:12.651
What do you think I am? Some kind
of chump? They're black, for God's sake.

06:12.719 --> 06:17.213
- They probably came
from defective oysters.
- The pearls ain't sick.

06:17.290 --> 06:20.987
Black pearls, they're supposed--
What? They're supposed to be black!

06:21.061 --> 06:24.758
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Don't be that way.
You know I'm nuts about you.

06:24.831 --> 06:29.200
If you're nuts about me, Nickie,
why don't you get me out
of this lousy chorus line?

06:29.269 --> 06:32.864
I came to New York to be an actress.
That's where my gifts are.

06:32.939 --> 06:36.773
You will, baby. You'll be a great
actress. A promise is a promise.

06:36.843 --> 06:41.041
- Yeah, l--
- Come on. Get yourself dressed.
I'm takin' you to Harlem.

06:41.114 --> 06:44.709
- The Cotton Club?
- Yeah, baby.

06:44.784 --> 06:47.981
I'm telling you,
they read my play, they love it.
But they're afraid of it.

06:48.054 --> 06:50.318
It's irrelevant.
- It's not irrelevant!

06:50.390 --> 06:53.325
The point
I'm making is that...

06:53.393 --> 06:57.921
no truly great artist has ever
been appreciated in his lifetime.

06:57.997 --> 06:59.965
- Not one?
- No, no.

06:59.999 --> 07:05.266
- Flender.
- Take, uh, uh... Van Gogh
or Edgar Allen Poe.

07:05.338 --> 07:09.240
Poe died poor and freezing
with his cat curled on his feet.

07:09.309 --> 07:12.870
David, don't give up on it.
Maybe it'll be produced posthumously.

07:12.946 --> 07:16.905
You know, l-l-l have never
had a play produced-- That's right.

07:16.983 --> 07:21.079
- And I've written one play every
year for the past 20 years.
- That's because you're a genius.

07:21.154 --> 07:24.920
The proof is that both common
people and intellectuals find
your work completely incoherent.

07:24.991 --> 07:28.290
- It means you're a genius.
- We all have our moments of doubt.

07:28.361 --> 07:34.266
I paint a canvas every week, take one
look at it and slash it with a razor.

07:34.300 --> 07:38.134
- Well, in your case that's a good idea.
- I have faith in your plays.

07:38.171 --> 07:41.971
- She has faith in my plays
because she loves me.
- Also because you're a genius.

07:42.041 --> 07:44.976
Ten years ago, l-l-l kidnapped
this woman from a very beautiful...

07:45.044 --> 07:48.309
middle-class life in Pittsburgh, and
I made her life miserable ever since.

07:48.381 --> 07:51.373
Hey, Ellen, as long
as he's a good man, keep him.

07:51.451 --> 07:55.319
You know, I think the mistake
we women make is we fall
in love with the artist--

07:55.355 --> 07:57.323
- Hey, you guys, are you listening?
- Yes, yes.

07:57.357 --> 08:00.019
- We fall in love with
the artist, not the man.
- I don't think that's a mistake.

08:00.093 --> 08:02.527
- How is that a mistake?
- The artist makes the man.

08:02.762 --> 08:06.789
She's right. You can't
separate 'em. No, look. Say
there was a burning building...

08:06.866 --> 08:10.165
and you could rush in, and
you could save only one thing:

08:10.203 --> 08:15.300
either the last known copy
of Shakespeare's plays or
some anonymous human being.

08:15.341 --> 08:17.400
- You cannot--
- What would you do?

08:17.477 --> 08:19.968
- You cannot deprive the world
of those plays.
- Correct.

08:20.046 --> 08:22.446
- Phone call, David.
- It's an inanimate object.

08:22.515 --> 08:27.282
It's not an inanimate object!
It's art! Art is life! It lives!

08:27.353 --> 08:30.288
We got the money.
We can do the play.

08:30.323 --> 08:33.019
What? When? How?

08:33.092 --> 08:36.061
A single backer
goin' for the whole show.

08:36.129 --> 08:39.326
An old acquaintance. I'm up
at the Cotton Club. I ran into him.

08:39.399 --> 08:42.835
- And no hitches?
- Well, uh--

08:42.869 --> 08:47.101
We'll meet tomorrow and discuss it,
all right? Luxor Baths. Noon.

08:48.942 --> 08:53.311
Are you nuts? You think I'm gonna let
some amateur play the lead in my play?

08:53.379 --> 08:56.007
Did I say "lead"?
Did I say "lead," Mr. Genius?

08:56.049 --> 08:59.177
- Some guy's girlfriend 'cause
he's puttin' up the money?
- Did I say "lead"?

08:59.252 --> 09:02.187
I said a part, a role.
I thought maybe Dr. Philips.

09:02.222 --> 09:05.350
- The psychiatrist? It's a key role.
- What key role?

09:05.391 --> 09:08.554
- It's a small part. Key role!
- Who is this woman anyway?

09:08.628 --> 09:12.257
Olive Neal? I don't even know what
she looks like, much less can she act.

09:12.332 --> 09:15.301
He says she's the stuff
that stars are made of.

09:15.368 --> 09:18.269
That's 'cause he's in love with her.
And who is he anyway?

09:18.338 --> 09:22.832
- His name is Nick Valenti.
- How-How-- How do I know
that name? What's he do?

09:22.909 --> 09:26.276
- Ah, he's got his finger
in a number of pies.
- I don't like the sound of this.

09:26.346 --> 09:29.406
- Look, you wanna
get your play on or not?
- I gotta meet her first.

09:29.482 --> 09:31.575
- So you'll meet her.
- I'm conflicted.

09:31.651 --> 09:35.382
-You'll meet her. That's all I'm saying.
-The psychiatrist is not small.

09:35.421 --> 09:40.381
It's not the lead. It's-- It's a
small part. Who do you see in the lead?

09:40.426 --> 09:43.259
- I don't know.
- What about Helen Sinclair?

09:43.329 --> 09:47.231
Oh, sure. I mean, she'd be great.
But can we get her?

09:47.300 --> 09:50.064
Why can't we get her? She's been in
nothin' but flops the past three years.

09:50.136 --> 09:52.070
Yeah, but she's
a major actress.

09:52.105 --> 09:54.266
Was.

09:54.340 --> 09:57.207
She'd be great.
I mean, really, she's brilliant.

09:57.277 --> 10:00.542
- She possess the necessary fire.
For the part, she'd be great.
- You really think so?

10:00.613 --> 10:03.309
- I'm glad you think so.
- Think we can get her?

10:03.383 --> 10:07.285
- I sent the script
to her agent, Sidney Loomis.
- You did?

10:07.353 --> 10:10.982
- Did I do wrong? Did I do wrong?
- No, no.

10:11.057 --> 10:13.685
- Did I do wrong not checking
with you first?
- Not at all.

10:13.927 --> 10:16.623
- If so, I stand corrected. I mean that.
- No, really.

10:16.663 --> 10:20.360
- Helen Sinclair... really.
- Get it out.

10:20.433 --> 10:23.994
- She's great.
- Well, all we can do
is hope for the best.

10:24.070 --> 10:27.164
You must be joking!

10:27.240 --> 10:32.234
You want me to play some frumpy
housewife who gets dumped for a flapper?

10:32.312 --> 10:36.442
Don't you remember who I am?
Don't you know who you represent?

10:36.482 --> 10:40.475
- I'm Helen Sinclair!
- Definitely! You are
definitely Helen Sinclair.

10:40.553 --> 10:45.217
I look at you and I say Helen Sinclair!
But who better to play that role?

10:45.291 --> 10:48.055
- Under whose direction? Some novice!
- He's the author.

10:48.127 --> 10:51.722
- Of two flops.
- Julian says it was the directors
that messed up those projects.

10:51.965 --> 10:57.494
Julian Marx! I do plays put on
by Belasco or Sam Harris.

10:57.570 --> 11:01.006
Not some Yiddish pants salesman
turned producer.

11:01.074 --> 11:05.340
My ex-husband used to say,
"lf you're gonna go down,
go down with the best of them."

11:05.411 --> 11:09.108
- Which ex-husband?
- Oh, I don't know which ex-husband.
The one with the moustache.

11:09.182 --> 11:12.481
Listen to me. Authors are very often
the best directors of their own works.

11:12.552 --> 11:15.680
She's dowdy! Sid, the ingenue
has all the hot lines.

11:15.755 --> 11:18.349
Even the female psychiatrist
is a better role.

11:18.424 --> 11:21.393
But the role of Sylvia Poston
is the lead.

11:21.461 --> 11:26.330
Sylvia Poston.
Even the name reeks of Orbach's!

11:26.366 --> 11:30.063
I do Electra!
I do Lady Macbeth!

11:30.136 --> 11:35.403
I do plays by Noel and Phil Barry
or at least Max Anderson.

11:35.475 --> 11:40.105
Helen, listen to me. This is
a major part in a serious play.

11:40.179 --> 11:43.671
And let's face it, Helen. You have
not been in a hit in a long time.

11:43.716 --> 11:47.743
- In a long, long, long time.
- I'm still a star!

11:49.188 --> 11:52.123
I never play
frumps or virgins.

11:52.191 --> 11:54.557
You're a star because you're great,
and you are a great star.

11:54.594 --> 11:56.562
- But let me tell you somethin'.

11:56.596 --> 11:58.564
In the last couple of years...

11:58.598 --> 12:01.294
you're better known as an adulteress and
a drunk-- I say this in all due respect.

12:01.367 --> 12:03.733
I haven't had a drink
since New Year's Eve.

12:03.770 --> 12:05.738
- We're talkin' Chinese New Year's.
- Naturally.

12:05.772 --> 12:08.366
Still, that's two days, Sid.
You know how long that is for me?

12:08.441 --> 12:11.001
- What is it, Josette?
- Some flowers.

12:11.077 --> 12:13.045
Well, bring them here,
will you?

12:13.079 --> 12:16.276
The offers are not pourin' in
like they used to.

12:16.349 --> 12:18.783
They're from David Shayne.

12:19.018 --> 12:22.647
"As a small artist to a greater one.
That you merely consider my play...

12:22.722 --> 12:26.214
is all the fulfillment
I require.

12:26.259 --> 12:28.227
Hmm.

12:30.129 --> 12:35.066
- What's he like?
- I hear he's terrific.
A genius ready to emerge.

12:35.134 --> 12:38.399
- I have to be billed over the title.
- Where else?

12:38.471 --> 12:43.033
- Approval of the leading man.
The star's dressing room.
- This is not even a question.

12:43.109 --> 12:45.509
Approval of
all photos of me.

12:45.578 --> 12:48.103
Oh, it's still not
a very glamorous role.

12:48.147 --> 12:52.049
But maybe I could meet with David.
Maybe we could go over the script.

12:52.118 --> 12:56.077
Maybe there's a few ways
we could find to brighten her up. Hmm?

12:56.122 --> 12:58.215
Why am I nervous?

12:59.492 --> 13:03.428
- That was sad. Clara Bow had it rough.
- She's a doll.

13:03.463 --> 13:07.422
- I'd do anything to be in a movie.
- You're pretty enough.

13:07.500 --> 13:10.867
Do you think you could
ever speak to Mr. Valenti?

13:11.104 --> 13:13.664
- Mr. Valenti knows everybody.
He'll do the right thing.
- That's right.

13:13.739 --> 13:17.334
I hear he's gonna make Olive Neal
a Broadway star.

13:24.617 --> 13:27.279
Go, go, go!

13:27.353 --> 13:29.719
Where'd it happen?

13:29.789 --> 13:33.281
Who'd they get?
Oh, Jesus!

13:33.326 --> 13:36.523
All right, I'm gonna be
at Olive's for about an hour.

13:36.596 --> 13:39.827
You get some more guys downstairs
and call me back on the Masucci thing.

13:39.899 --> 13:43.096
-This is for Leo Kustabeck, you hear me?
- Hey!

13:43.169 --> 13:47.105
- You said this was the lead.
It's a smaller part.
- All right.

13:47.173 --> 13:49.801
- I got no time now.
- It's a smaller part.
I don't believe it.

13:49.876 --> 13:52.811
- They just got Vinny and Sal
outside a movie house.
- I counted the lines.

13:52.845 --> 13:56.713
- Sylvia Poston is the lead.
I'm just backing her up.
- You hear what I said?

13:56.782 --> 14:01.310
- I'm tired of backing people up.
I wanna be the lead.
- Julian says you're a doctor.

14:01.354 --> 14:05.154
- A doctor. I don't wanna be
a doctor. I wanna be the lead.
- A head doctor. It's a big part.

14:05.191 --> 14:07.853
A head doctor,
but it ain't the lead.

14:07.894 --> 14:10.556
- So don't try and snow me.
- You'd squawk if they
hung you with a new rope.

14:10.630 --> 14:13.622
- I know a lead when I see a lead,
and this ain't the lead.

14:13.699 --> 14:17.328
- A lead is on every single page.
A lead has lots of scenes.
- Hello? Oh, Vito.

14:17.403 --> 14:22.204
- Ya heard? Get everybody
together at the garage.
- I don't get to kiss nobody.

14:22.275 --> 14:25.210
- No, I want it done today!
What is it with you?
- Hey!

14:25.278 --> 14:29.442
- You wanna take your business
outta here? We got guests!
- Call me back.

14:29.515 --> 14:32.678
- I got trouble here.
- I don't care about your trouble.

14:32.752 --> 14:35.346
- What am I supposed to do?
Just foot the bills around here?
- I don't care.

14:35.421 --> 14:40.552
- And I want my say with
this Broadway big shot too.
- Okay, just don't embarrass me.

14:40.626 --> 14:44.221
- I'm lookin' out
for your interests, okay?
- Miss Olive?

14:44.297 --> 14:48.563
- There's a Mr. Marx and--
- I know, I know. Send 'em in, Venus.

14:48.634 --> 14:50.864
- Listen. When they get here...
- What?

14:50.937 --> 14:54.236
- charm 'em a little, baby.
- You're the one that
needs charm lessons.

14:54.307 --> 14:57.504
- I told them you're a great actress.
- I am a great actress.

14:57.577 --> 15:00.671
Nick Valenti!
Say hello to David Shayne.

15:00.713 --> 15:03.273
- David, how are you?
- Hello. I'm Olive.

15:03.349 --> 15:05.374
- This is Olive Neal.
- Charmed, charmed, charmed.

15:05.418 --> 15:08.444
- Come on in. Come on.
- Come on in.

15:08.521 --> 15:11.490
- Hey, Dave, she read your play.
She thinks it's great.
- Yes, I read your play.

15:11.557 --> 15:14.355
It's thrilling, turbulent,
a page turner.

15:14.427 --> 15:16.987
Charmed, charmed,
charmed, charmed.

15:17.230 --> 15:19.494
She's a great little actress.
Just needs a break.

15:19.565 --> 15:22.500
- What have you been in, Miss, uh--
- Olive. Olive. Olive.

15:22.568 --> 15:24.593
- Call me Olive, honey.
- You smoke?
- No.

15:24.670 --> 15:27.400
- Olive, ah, your--
well, your experience?
- I love the play.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.874
- Well, l, uh--
- Oh, she ain't got no experience.

15:29.942 --> 15:32.342
- I do too. I have too.
- She's a natural.

15:32.411 --> 15:34.436
- I have experience.
- They ain't talkin' dancin', Olive.

15:34.513 --> 15:37.914
- He doesn't know
what he's talkin' about.
- You don't mean dancin', do you?

15:37.984 --> 15:42.683
She used to wiggle at this joint
in Hoboken. Pick up quarters
off the tabletops with her--

15:42.755 --> 15:45.986
- Hey! Butt out, why don't ya!
They're talkin' to me!
- I'm tryin' to break the ice.

15:46.225 --> 15:49.251
- Who wants a drink?
- I'll have a double anything. Be great.

15:49.328 --> 15:51.558
- No, I have an ulcer.
- Venus, a double whiskey.

15:51.631 --> 15:55.260
- Make it two, Venus.
- Do you want the blue
stuff or the green?

15:55.334 --> 15:58.895
- The imported, dummy.
- Oh, you mean from the clean bathtub.

15:58.971 --> 16:00.734
Mm-hmm.

16:02.308 --> 16:06.335
- So you never acted before?
- Honey, honey. Yes, I have acted.

16:06.412 --> 16:11.008
I have acted. I've acted a lot.
I was in a musical revue.
Can you light this for me?

16:11.250 --> 16:14.811
Geez. No manners.
No gentleman.

16:16.255 --> 16:18.917
Yeah, I did a musical revue
in Wichita.

16:18.991 --> 16:22.791
Maybe you heard of it. It was called
Leave A Specimen. I had two songs.

16:22.862 --> 16:25.990
- Two numbers. Two thrilling,
show-stopping numbers.

16:26.065 --> 16:28.829
I'm actually feeling
a little sick, really.

16:28.901 --> 16:31.369
I'm actually feeling a little faint.
Can we sit down?

16:31.437 --> 16:37.342
So, one thing I was wonderin'
is who's gonna be playing
the part of Sylvia Poston?

16:37.410 --> 16:39.708
Only Helen Sinclair.

16:39.779 --> 16:43.977
Helen Sinclair?
I never heard of her.

16:44.016 --> 16:48.646
- Uh, you follow the theater?
- What are you trying to insinuate?

16:48.721 --> 16:50.655
Hey, don't
gimme that shit!

16:50.723 --> 16:55.422
You tell Masucci he don't play
ball, I'll come down there,
I'll chop his fuckin' legs off!

16:55.494 --> 16:59.055
Don't you pay any attention to Nick.
He's in one of his depressed moods.

16:59.298 --> 17:03.496
I'll cut his throat. I'll come
down there, I'll pull his guts
out through his windpipe!

17:03.569 --> 17:05.695
- Ya hear me?
- What'd ya do? Walk up?

17:05.771 --> 17:07.704
- No!
- You're sweating like a pig.

17:07.772 --> 17:11.834
- I have a bit of a blood sugar
situation now and again.
- Blood sugar?

17:11.911 --> 17:15.608
- What is that?
- Olive, you-- you like the play?

17:15.681 --> 17:19.377
- Mmm. It's sad.
- Well, it's a tragedy.

17:19.417 --> 17:23.444
I'll say, but I got some ideas
how we can goose it up.

17:23.521 --> 17:26.116
- Ideas?
- Mm-hmm. I go to
the movies all the time.

17:26.358 --> 17:31.353
- I got a million clever ideas.
- You burn it down, Cheech!
Burn it down, I said.

17:31.430 --> 17:34.831
- I want it to look like arson!
- I got a crick.

17:34.900 --> 17:36.765
- When?
- A crick?

17:36.836 --> 17:41.364
Everything's tight.
I think maybe we should go.

17:41.407 --> 17:44.035
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't go.

17:44.110 --> 17:46.840
Hey, Venus, let's go
with that hooch!

17:46.912 --> 17:50.370
Uh, uh, Olive, when did you
get interested in acting?

17:50.449 --> 17:54.977
Hey, listen, you think
I came to this town to swing
it around in a chorus line?

17:55.054 --> 17:59.081
Tits and ass. Tits and ass.
That's all they care about. Thank you.

17:59.158 --> 18:02.150
Hey, didn't I tell you
to make "horse durves"?

18:02.395 --> 18:05.796
I don't make nothin' out of horses,
especially "horse durves..."

18:05.865 --> 18:08.493
'cause I don't know what
they are, and neither do you!

18:08.567 --> 18:12.628
Oh, ain't you the big mouth
since you hit your number.

18:12.705 --> 18:17.938
- And I said the imported stuff.
- The imported stuff ate through
the bottle. It's gone !

18:18.010 --> 18:21.070
A likely story. It's very hard
to get good help these days.

18:21.147 --> 18:24.014
- Sorry you guys had to hear that.
- I'm feeling fairly dizzy.

18:24.083 --> 18:28.884
- Some problems with the firm.
- Really? What type of firm is it, Nick?

18:28.954 --> 18:32.754
- 
- It's a "don't stick your nose in
other people's business...

18:32.792 --> 18:35.590
- and it won't get broken type of firm.
- Yeah.

18:35.628 --> 18:38.893
- I see, I see. Thank you.
- That's what kind of firm.

18:38.964 --> 18:42.127
I'm feeling a bit unstable.
I think maybe I'll go...

18:42.201 --> 18:45.693
and check into a sanitarium
and get the help that I need.

18:45.771 --> 18:49.571
- And we'll talk later because
it's been good. Hasn't it, Julian?
- Yeah.

18:49.642 --> 18:51.576
- Oh, yeah.
- It's been good.

18:51.644 --> 18:54.909
- This is gonna be
a big event on Broadway.
- Thank you.

18:54.980 --> 18:57.881
Absolutely not!
No!

18:57.950 --> 19:00.976
- You'll work with her, mold her.
It'll be a challenge.
- Out of the question!

19:01.053 --> 19:04.113
She'll win an award. It'll be a great
show business anecdote.

19:04.190 --> 19:08.490
- It will not happen!
- A tribute to you as a director.
You use your actors like clay.

19:08.561 --> 19:11.223
Julian, have you lost
all reason?

19:11.464 --> 19:15.662
Do you believe that that woman
could play a psychiatrist?
That woman? That thing?

19:15.734 --> 19:17.668
- Her voice, her grasp.
- All right.

19:17.736 --> 19:22.639
- She's the woman who picks
quarters off tabletops with--
- Let me level with you.

19:22.675 --> 19:25.610
This is a dog-eat-dog world,
not an ideal world.

19:25.678 --> 19:28.647
If you wanna get your play on, you're
gonna have to make a few concessions.

19:28.714 --> 19:31.774
Life is not perfect.
Plus, it is short.

19:31.851 --> 19:36.220
If you can't figure that out,
you might as well pack up right
now and go back to Pittsburgh.

19:41.227 --> 19:45.596
I sold out! I sold out.

19:45.664 --> 19:47.859
- I sold out.
- David.

19:51.270 --> 19:53.864
- What's wrong?

19:53.939 --> 19:55.998
I'm a whore!
- Oh, my God!

19:56.075 --> 19:59.169
- I'm a prostitute! I'm a whore!
- David, pull yourself together.

19:59.245 --> 20:00.906
- They'll call the police.

20:00.980 --> 20:03.540
David. Oh, my God!
You look horrible.

20:03.616 --> 20:05.277
Oh, I feel sick.

20:05.518 --> 20:09.887
Please, you'll wake the Finkelsteins.
You want an aspirin?

20:09.955 --> 20:14.085
- David. David.
- Oh, my God! My art! My work!

20:14.159 --> 20:17.060
- What's wrong with you?
- Do I want success that badly?

20:17.129 --> 20:21.156
- David. Come back to bed.
- The answer's yes. The answer's yes.

20:21.233 --> 20:25.294
- Please come back to bed.
- When offered to have my play
backed by a hoodlum, I said yes.

20:25.538 --> 20:29.201
- Please come back to bed.
- It's a deal with the devil,
and the penalty is...

20:29.275 --> 20:33.177
- his girlfriend plays a part.
- Who are you calling at 3:00 a.m.?

20:33.245 --> 20:37.079
Hello, Julian? It's David.
Who do you see in the male lead?

20:37.149 --> 20:39.811
Oh, kid.

20:39.885 --> 20:42.046
It's 3:00 a.m.

20:42.087 --> 20:45.284
- I see Warner Purcell.
- Nah, too fat.

20:45.524 --> 20:49.893
You seen him lately?
Nah, the man's a compulsive eater.

20:49.962 --> 20:51.896
Doesn't matter.
I talked to his agent...

20:51.931 --> 20:53.899
and he's been on a new diet
for four months. He looks fine.

20:53.933 --> 20:56.663
I want him for Lieutenant Masters.
Then maybe I can live with all this.

20:56.735 --> 20:58.794
I can live with
these compromises.

20:58.871 --> 21:03.001
I'll have Warner Purcell
and Helen Sinclair, and then
I can live with that gun moll!

21:03.075 --> 21:05.942
No, not Warner, kid. No.

21:05.978 --> 21:08.310
I had him in Nuns Aplenty.

21:08.547 --> 21:12.779
He'll turn over a new leaf. Then he'll
get insecure; he'll start eating.

21:12.851 --> 21:17.049
By the time we get to Boston, he'll be
as big as my sister-in-law's ass.

21:17.122 --> 21:21.252
No! No more compromises!
It is my play, and I want him!

21:21.327 --> 21:24.956
I want him, and I want him,
and that's it. I'm not a whore!

21:25.030 --> 21:28.193
- David, David, David!
- I'm all right.

21:28.267 --> 21:31.896
Olive starts rehearsal
for a show next week.

21:31.971 --> 21:34.098
- I want you to stay with her.
- Yeah.

21:34.139 --> 21:37.131
I want you to make sure
they treat her right up there.

21:37.209 --> 21:40.076
Those theater characters
I don't trust 'em.

21:40.145 --> 21:44.138
The show's costing me a bundle,
and I'm gonna get my money's worth.

21:44.216 --> 21:47.185
- She wants to be a star.
- Yeah. Yeah.

21:47.252 --> 21:50.244
- And I promised her.
- Mr. V., look, it's not
that I don't wanna do it--

21:50.289 --> 21:54.692
Cheech, I'm giving you
an order. What do you do?

21:54.760 --> 21:56.785
I know.

21:56.862 --> 21:58.989
Monday, September 10.

21:59.064 --> 22:02.591
Today rehearsals began,
and I've decided to keep a journal.

22:02.668 --> 22:05.296
Perhaps my experience
will be of value to others...

22:05.337 --> 22:09.671
just as I pore over with relish
the notes of my idols:
Chekov and Strindberg.

22:09.742 --> 22:13.007
Rehearsals began promptly
at 10:00 a.m.

22:13.078 --> 22:16.946
Warner Purcell was first to arrive
full of bonhomie and good humor.

22:17.016 --> 22:20.816
- Good morning!
- Warner Purcell.
Hello, I'm David Shayne.

22:20.886 --> 22:23.753
- Oh, David, how marvelous
to meet you. Well done.
- Thank you.

22:23.822 --> 22:26.882
- It's a wonderful play.
Some lovely speeches.
- I'm honored you're doing it.

22:26.959 --> 22:28.984
- It's my pleasure.
- Our stage manager, Mitch.

22:29.061 --> 22:31.791
- Mitchell Sabine.
I'm here if you need anything.
- Mitchell, nice to meet you.

22:31.864 --> 22:34.059
- That's fine.
- And you're gonna be
in dressing room two.

22:34.133 --> 22:36.294
- Lovely.
- And this is my assistant, Lorna.

22:36.368 --> 22:38.996
- Pleased to meet you.
- Lorna, nice to meet you.

22:39.071 --> 22:42.165
We have coffee and Danish,
some smoked salmon.

22:42.241 --> 22:46.439
Um, Mitchell, would it be
frightfully tiresome if I just
had hot water and lemon?

22:46.679 --> 22:48.670
- Not at all.
- Thank you.

22:48.747 --> 22:51.238
- And of course you know Julian Marx.
- Oh, Julian, yes.

22:51.316 --> 22:53.841
- Our swords have crossed.
- Warner, you look wonderful.

22:53.886 --> 22:56.013
- And yourself.

22:56.088 --> 22:59.057
Eden Brent, who plays
the other woman, arrived second.

22:59.091 --> 23:01.150
She has
a wonderful vivacity.

23:01.226 --> 23:05.026
Good morning! Good morning!
Don't get up. Don't get up.

23:05.064 --> 23:08.227
- I have first-day-rehearsal
presents for everybody.
- How thoughtful.

23:08.267 --> 23:13.102
It's nothing. Just some soap and some
potpourri and incense for you, I think.

23:13.172 --> 23:16.335
- Now, have you met Mr. Woofles?
- No. No.

23:16.408 --> 23:19.775
- Oh, don't pull such a sour face.
- Hello, Mr. Woofles.

23:19.845 --> 23:21.779
Oh, be careful.
She's a Chihuahua...

23:21.847 --> 23:25.908
but there's a pinch of Doberman in her
so sometimes she goes for your throat.

23:25.984 --> 23:28.111
- Just kidding.

23:28.187 --> 23:31.782
- I think you've met
everyone here. Lorna.
- We talked on the telephone.

23:31.857 --> 23:34.690
I don't know if you've met
our Lieutenant Masters, Warner Purcell.

23:34.760 --> 23:37.160
- Oh, pleased to meet you.
- How was your crossing?

23:37.229 --> 23:40.926
- Well, I came over
five years ago, but it was lovely.

23:40.999 --> 23:44.059
Now, my darling, do you want
some milk or something to eat?

23:44.136 --> 23:48.266
- I'll get her a saucer.
- You don't have to bother with
that because I breast-feed her.

23:48.340 --> 23:52.037
- Just kidding, everybody.

23:52.111 --> 23:54.306
- Please.
- Julian, nice to see you.

23:54.379 --> 23:56.813
- How are you?
- Mr. Marx.
- Yes, of course.

23:56.882 --> 23:59.510
I'm in the middle, yes?

23:59.752 --> 24:02.414
- Should we take the dog--
- No, no, no, no, no.

24:02.488 --> 24:05.286
It's my baby.

24:05.357 --> 24:09.293
Olive Neal entered, naturally,
with the force of a hurricane.

24:09.328 --> 24:13.731
- Hey, you gonna hover
over me like dead meat?
- Mr. V. says I stay close.

24:13.799 --> 24:15.733
We've been drivin'
around for 15 minutes.

24:15.801 --> 24:19.532
I told ya he said the Belasco,
not the Morosco, you cementhead!

24:19.772 --> 24:21.137
- Hello, Olive.
- Hello.

24:21.206 --> 24:24.403
- Everyone, this is Dr. Philips.
Olive Neal.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

24:24.476 --> 24:25.966
- You know Julian.
- Yes.

24:26.044 --> 24:28.035
- My assistant, Lorna.
- Hi.

24:28.113 --> 24:30.240
- Eden Brent, Kristen.
- Ah, cute dog.

24:30.315 --> 24:32.909
- Warner Purcell. Lieutenant Masters.
- Charmed, charmed, charmed.

24:32.985 --> 24:35.419
- Stage manager Mitch.
- Mitch, hi, hi, hi, hi.

24:35.487 --> 24:38.251
- And you are?
- I'm with her.

24:38.323 --> 24:41.315
- He's with me. Yeah.
- Okay. Okay.

24:41.393 --> 24:44.794
Well, um, we're just gonna
rehearse for a while, so--

24:44.830 --> 24:46.798
Yeah.
Where she goes, I go.

24:46.832 --> 24:49.824
All right, buster,
why don't you park yourself in
the back row of the theater...

24:49.902 --> 24:51.836
and try not to snore.

24:51.904 --> 24:54.372
Um, l--

24:54.439 --> 24:57.431
- What?
- I don't like other people
watching rehearsals...

24:57.509 --> 25:01.309
- generally as a rule because
the actors are very sensitive.
- What'd you say?

25:01.380 --> 25:04.816
- I-l don't like--
- Hey, hey, who are you? Who are you?

25:04.850 --> 25:06.841
- Whoa, whoa. Easy.
- I'm the director.

25:06.885 --> 25:08.318
- Who is this?
- Wait a minute.

25:08.387 --> 25:11.288
- I'm the director of the play.
- Wait a minute, Mr., uh--

25:11.323 --> 25:14.224
- Cheech. The name's Cheech.
- Mr. Cheech, first of all--

25:14.293 --> 25:16.989
- No, not Mr. Cheech. Ya hear me?
- Yeah.

25:17.062 --> 25:19.997
- Cheech. Simple. Cheech.
- Cheech.

25:20.065 --> 25:24.365
Now, why don't you just take a seat
in the back and we'll-- Yeah, go ahead.

25:24.403 --> 25:26.997
- That's it.
- I find this very problematic.

25:27.072 --> 25:29.233
- I'll be over there.
- He'll be unobtrusive, believe me.

25:29.308 --> 25:32.971
He's not gonna bother anybody.
He just wants to watch.

25:33.045 --> 25:36.014
He's my bodyguard.

25:36.081 --> 25:38.481
- Hi.
- Hello.

25:38.550 --> 25:43.078
- Sorry I'm late.
I'm usually highly professional.
- Oh, I'm sure.

25:43.155 --> 25:47.353
- This is for you.
- Oh, talcum powder. My favorite.

25:47.392 --> 25:51.158
- Thank you. You're a doll.
- Oh, no, you're a doll.

25:51.196 --> 25:54.962
Helen Sinclair came a half
hour late, but she had a good excuse.

25:55.033 --> 25:58.594
Please forgive me.
My pedicurist had a stroke.

25:58.837 --> 26:02.295
She fell forward onto the orange stick
and plunged it into my toe.

26:02.374 --> 26:05.241
- It required bandaging.
- Oh, my poor darling.

26:05.310 --> 26:07.870
Oh, it's so good
to see you.

26:07.913 --> 26:10.575
- We all know and admire Helen Sinclair.
-  We're old friends.

26:10.649 --> 26:13.413
- Thank you so much.
- Miss Sinclair, this is Mitch.

26:13.485 --> 26:18.548
Oh, yes, yes. Oh, my goodness' sake.
I can't believe I'm here.

26:18.624 --> 26:22.560
Oh-ho, look at this.
Look at this. Would you look?

26:22.594 --> 26:25.290
Oh, this old theater.

26:27.032 --> 26:29.057
This church.

26:30.168 --> 26:32.568
So replete
with memories.

26:32.638 --> 26:36.005
So full of ghosts.

26:36.074 --> 26:38.406
Mrs. Alving.

26:38.477 --> 26:40.445
Uncle Vanya.

26:41.480 --> 26:43.914
There's Cordelia.

26:44.616 --> 26:47.107
Here's Ophelia.

26:48.654 --> 26:50.986
Clytemenstra!

26:52.557 --> 26:55.025
Each performance
a birth.

26:56.128 --> 26:58.426
Each curtain...

26:58.497 --> 27:00.556
a death.

27:03.402 --> 27:05.597
Was that a mutt?

27:05.671 --> 27:08.299
Yes, Miss Sinclair.

27:08.373 --> 27:12.503
- I hate mutts!

27:12.577 --> 27:15.569
I didn't want to overwhelm
any of the actors on the first day...

27:15.647 --> 27:18.275
so all we did
was read through the play.

27:18.350 --> 27:20.545
I can't live
like this.

27:20.619 --> 27:24.077
The same routine
over and over and over.

27:24.156 --> 27:26.522
The days blend together
like melted celluloid.

27:26.591 --> 27:30.152
Like a film whose images
become distorted and meaningless.

27:30.228 --> 27:33.459
I want a divorce, Sylvia. I've said it
in a thousand subtle ways...

27:33.532 --> 27:36.592
hoping you would realize,
but you refuse to see it.

27:36.668 --> 27:39.637
As a little girl,
I swore one day...

27:39.705 --> 27:43.038
I would have a necklace
made from the Milky Way.

27:43.108 --> 27:48.444
Oh, Kristen, Kristen, if only humans
weren't cursed with the power of memory.

27:48.513 --> 27:52.176
Dreams are only disguised feelings.

27:52.250 --> 27:56.550
The more we bring these
painful experiences to the fore...

27:56.621 --> 27:59.488
the easier they become
to deal with.

27:59.558 --> 28:02.118
- What's the "fore"?
- The fore. The foreground.

28:02.194 --> 28:04.287
ls it-- Could l?
- Please.

28:04.363 --> 28:08.299
It's a golf term, when you yell, "fore"
when you're coming forward.

28:08.367 --> 28:12.133
I didn't realize that.
- So you're telling me
she's talking about golf?

28:12.204 --> 28:13.466
- Continue!
- What?

28:13.538 --> 28:16.166
Oh, yes, okay. Doctor...

28:16.208 --> 28:19.439
am I unattractive,
worn out?

28:19.511 --> 28:23.641
Spent? Broken?
Desiccated? Old?

28:23.715 --> 28:27.981
Come, come, Mrs. Poston.
You're being mas--

28:29.287 --> 28:31.187
- Mas--
- Masochistic.

28:31.256 --> 28:36.159
- Masochistic?
- Yes, masochism is someone
who enjoys pain.

28:36.228 --> 28:39.129
-  As opposed to sadism.
- Enjoys pain?

28:39.197 --> 28:41.324
What is she,
retarded?

28:41.366 --> 28:44.460
- I don't fuckin' believe this!
- Continue.

28:44.536 --> 28:47.767
After the rehearsal,
I felt exhilarated.

28:48.006 --> 28:50.497
Helen Sinclair suggested
we go for a drink to unwind.

28:50.542 --> 28:54.808
She said she knew
of a little out-of-the-way
speakeasy where we could talk.

28:55.047 --> 28:57.515
- It was wonderful to see old, uh--
- Wasn't it?

28:57.582 --> 29:01.040
- Warner. Yes.
- Warner, yeah. He looks so slim.

29:01.086 --> 29:04.214
- He's on a new diet.
- Who is she? Oh, I need a drink.

29:04.289 --> 29:06.416
Olive. 
Yes. I'm sorry about Olive.

29:06.491 --> 29:09.221
I do apologize.
We needed her to raise the money.

29:09.294 --> 29:11.626
It must be difficult
getting a work like this on.

29:11.696 --> 29:14.164
It's a sad reality
of the marketplace, I'll tell ya.

29:14.232 --> 29:16.666
- We've never really
had a chance to talk.
- No.

29:16.735 --> 29:20.330
- Hi, folks. What can I get you?
- Two martinis, please, very dry.

29:20.405 --> 29:23.738
- How'd you know what I drank?
- Oh, you want one too?

29:23.775 --> 29:25.766
- Three.
- Three martinis.

29:25.844 --> 29:29.336
Uh, I can't judge my own writing,
but I must say...

29:29.414 --> 29:33.578
that just from today's reading,
I can tell how brilliant
you're going to be in this role.

29:33.652 --> 29:35.517
- It's a wonderful play.
- Thank you.

29:35.587 --> 29:39.648
No, no, I mean it. It's so rare
that anything is really about something.

29:39.724 --> 29:42.659
You know-- Well, there's Max Anderson
and Gene O'Neill.

29:42.727 --> 29:45.252
- That's about it.
- You just named my two living gods.

29:45.297 --> 29:48.266
I was a little reluctant at first
to play the part.

29:48.300 --> 29:52.600
The character is so--
She's so, um... uh, colorless.

29:52.671 --> 29:54.332
Colorless, yes.
Well, that's the idea--

29:54.406 --> 29:56.397
- Then I realized what
you were going for.
- You did?

29:56.475 --> 29:58.636
How profound, how complex,
her inner life really is.

29:58.710 --> 30:01.178
I tried to give her
some contradictions.

30:01.246 --> 30:03.214
I was worried.

30:03.281 --> 30:07.274
I'm used to playing
more overtly heroic women.

30:07.319 --> 30:10.117
Less tentative.
More alluring.

30:10.188 --> 30:12.588
Certainly not
frigid.

30:12.657 --> 30:17.890
No, yes, yes. Well, Sylvia Poston
is a mass of neuroses.

30:18.130 --> 30:22.191
In spite of the fact that I
could really find nothing at all
in the play to brighten her up...

30:22.267 --> 30:25.395
- no real passion, no seductiveness...
- Nothing?

30:25.470 --> 30:27.768
I still think that
she's worth playing.

30:27.839 --> 30:31.900
We could work it over, and
a touch here or there could be
changed to make sure you're...

30:32.144 --> 30:35.238
- No, no, no, no.
I wouldn't dream of you...
- comfortable.

30:35.313 --> 30:37.838
changing a word
of your work for me.

30:37.916 --> 30:43.115
God, who am l, some
vain Broadway legend?

30:43.188 --> 30:46.919
You... you're
a budding Chekhov.

30:50.195 --> 30:55.223
I'm not saying I'll distort the play.
I'm just saying I'll reread it
with that in mind.

30:55.300 --> 30:58.360
I mean, after all, Miss Sinclair--
Helen. May I call you Helen?

30:58.436 --> 31:00.563
- Yes.
- Helen...

31:00.639 --> 31:03.767
your instincts as an actress
are impeccable.

31:03.842 --> 31:08.575
And I want the character
to have dimension. I don't mean
for her to be a drone.

31:09.681 --> 31:12.844
- You see through me, don't you?
- Me?

31:12.884 --> 31:15.216
You're clever.

31:15.287 --> 31:17.517
You're brilliant.

31:17.556 --> 31:20.184
What insight
into women.

31:20.258 --> 31:22.317
Don't deny it.

31:27.365 --> 31:30.425
I don't see why
she has to be frigid.

31:34.873 --> 31:38.206
Hey, how ya doin', doll?
How'd it go?

31:38.243 --> 31:40.541
Ah, they're all
so stuck up.

31:40.612 --> 31:43.479
- Yeah? Anybody botherin' her?
- No.

31:43.548 --> 31:46.381
They expect me to memorize
all these lines.

31:46.418 --> 31:50.218
- Well, that's what you wanted,
isn't it? To be an actress?
- I know, I know, I know.

31:50.255 --> 31:53.816
- I got a headache.
- Cheech'll help you
practice after we eat.

31:53.892 --> 31:57.487
- Me?
- The girl's got stuff
to memorize, all right?

31:57.562 --> 32:00.827
- Yeah, but, Nick--
- Go sit in the tub, honey. Go ahead.

32:00.899 --> 32:04.630
I'm takin' you out to Delmonico's.
You want sirloin or a lobster?

32:04.703 --> 32:08.366
- One of each.
- Listen, Nick, I'm not too good
at this memorizing, and I got a date--

32:08.440 --> 32:12.308
All right, all right, knock it off.
I got a little errand for you to run.

32:12.377 --> 32:17.212
- What kind of errand?
- A message for Charlie Masucci,
and we ain't got a lot of time.

33:02.294 --> 33:04.660
Can't you see...

33:04.696 --> 33:07.893
you're living out
the exact same pattern...

33:07.966 --> 33:10.662
your mother lived out
with your father?

33:10.735 --> 33:13.829
I am?
Pray tell.

33:13.905 --> 33:17.272
In some way,
you're trying to relive it,

33:17.342 --> 33:21.403
and in the process
of reliving it, correct it.

33:21.479 --> 33:24.971
As if that were possible.
Ha!

33:25.050 --> 33:28.281
-It don't say "Ha."
-I know it don't say "Ha." I added that.

33:28.353 --> 33:31.550
- What do ya mean you added that?
Are you allowed to do that?
- We're allowed to add things.

33:31.623 --> 33:34.023
- How could you add something?
You can't do that.
- You're allowed!

33:34.092 --> 33:36.526
- It's called ad-libbing.
- You can't do that!

33:36.594 --> 33:39.961
I can do that. What do you know? You
don't know nothin'. Shut up and read.

33:40.031 --> 33:43.626
- I think the whole thing stinks.
- I think you're a degenerate
zombie. Shut up and read!

33:43.702 --> 33:46.398
- You better shut up! Just shut up!
- You shut up and read.

33:46.471 --> 33:49.406
- You shut up!
- You're lucky you're Nick's girl.

33:49.474 --> 33:51.408
You're lucky
you're an idiot.

33:51.476 --> 33:56.345
What endeavors you...
to concoct a theory so tenuous?

33:56.381 --> 33:58.110
Mmm-mmm-mm.

33:58.350 --> 34:02.343
I sure pities the poor folks who gonna
have to pay to see this play.

34:04.522 --> 34:08.458
- What ya thinking?
- Oh, just about Eugene O'Neill
and Max Anderson, you know.

34:08.525 --> 34:11.927
Yeah. You've been rewriting all night
and it's only just the first day.

34:11.996 --> 34:14.362
- Is that a bad sign?
- No. I just think that
I might have made...

34:14.431 --> 34:16.797
the character of Sylvia Poston
a bit too antiseptic.

34:16.868 --> 34:18.927
- She's gotta have a sexual side to her.
- No.

34:19.003 --> 34:23.406
- I think she's the best female
character you've written in a long time.
- Says who?

34:23.475 --> 34:26.842
David, you know you always have
problems getting into the female mind.

34:26.911 --> 34:30.870
- I know that you think that.
- You've said so yourself before.
We've had this discussion.

34:30.949 --> 34:35.545
All your friends are men. You-- You've
always had problems writing for women.

34:35.620 --> 34:38.418
Witness your relationship
with your mother, your grandmother...

34:38.489 --> 34:41.583
- your two aunts, your sister--
- I think I try to factor that
into my work.

34:41.659 --> 34:43.592
But to be honest with you...

34:43.661 --> 34:45.594
at this moment, I don't think
you really understand my work at all.

34:45.663 --> 34:47.722
- Oh! Don't be so defensive.
- I'm not being defensive.

34:47.799 --> 34:51.735
Perhaps my opinions just aren't
intellectual enough for you.
Maybe they're just not--

34:51.803 --> 34:55.967
That's a horrible thing to say.
When you have a good idea,
I listen to it. I'm responsive.

34:56.040 --> 34:59.498
- In this case, I think you're
wrong. That's about it.
- When am I right?

34:59.577 --> 35:03.013
You're right about other things, but not
about Sylvia Poston and her sexuality.

35:03.081 --> 35:06.642
September 17.
The first week is behind me now...

35:06.718 --> 35:10.552
and apart from a few minor incidents,
things seemed to go okay.

35:10.588 --> 35:13.056
There was that moment
between Helen and Eden.

35:13.124 --> 35:17.026
I can't do that speech if she's
going to be fidgeting around upstage!

35:17.095 --> 35:19.689
- Well, that's why I think
I should sit. I'll sit.
- Oh, God!

35:19.764 --> 35:23.393
Sylvia would never ask her to sit
in her own house. She despises her!

35:23.468 --> 35:27.131
She doesn't want me to sit. She doesn't
want me to stand. I guess I could squat.

35:27.172 --> 35:30.403
David, do you realize you're asking an
audience to believe that my husband...

35:30.442 --> 35:32.433
would leave me
for this woman?

35:32.510 --> 35:36.412
- Come along.
- Excuse me. Excuse me, but
I think it's made very clear...

35:36.481 --> 35:39.211
in the speech about erotic attraction,
why he does that.

35:39.451 --> 35:41.919
You fool! He's thinking of me
when he does that speech.
Don't you know anything?

35:41.953 --> 35:44.421
- Only the part about the liver spots.
- Listen.

35:44.489 --> 35:48.448
How long has it been since
you've had a real hemorrhage?

35:48.493 --> 35:52.520
David, I wonder if now would be a moment
to do my soliloquy from Act ll?

35:52.597 --> 35:57.625
- Did you hear what she--
- Please. Aspirin!

35:57.669 --> 36:01.435
All right, yes, why don't we?
And, Eden, just take five.

36:01.473 --> 36:04.169
- I need an aspirin!

36:04.242 --> 36:07.177
Mitch.

36:07.212 --> 36:10.807
Then there was the time when
I tried to cut one of Olive's speeches.

36:10.882 --> 36:14.943
- I like that speech,
and I already got it memorized.
- But it's superfluous.

36:15.019 --> 36:17.749
- It's-- What is it?
- Well, I've overwritten it.

36:17.822 --> 36:22.156
We know how you feel
about Sylvia's breakdown when
you talk with the good doctor.

36:22.227 --> 36:25.025
So it's my fault.
Um, the performance is fine.

36:25.096 --> 36:28.190
But, um...
I like to say it.

36:28.266 --> 36:30.757
- We-- We don't need it.
- Hey!

36:30.835 --> 36:33.861
Are you tryin' to make
my part smaller?

36:33.938 --> 36:36.498
- No, no, every--
- My part's small enough as it is!

36:36.574 --> 36:40.169
Every play needs some cuts, and the size
of the role is not the important thing.

36:40.245 --> 36:43.840
Did you hear what she said? She doesn't
want her speech taken away from her!

36:43.915 --> 36:48.477
- Look, look, Mr. Cheech, I've about--
- I'd rather be shootin' crap myself...

36:48.553 --> 36:53.149
but Mr. V. told me that she's gotta
be up there a lot!

36:53.224 --> 36:55.852
- I wrote this play,
and I'm directing this play!
- I don't care.

36:55.927 --> 36:59.886
You wanna get slapped here or do
you want me to take you outside
and we'll straighten this out?

36:59.964 --> 37:02.660
It's up to you.

37:05.904 --> 37:09.670
Warner Purcell remains
good-spirited and a joy to work with.

37:09.741 --> 37:15.077
And what discipline. Although,
I notice he no longer has just
a cup of hot water and lemon.

37:17.315 --> 37:21.251
 lf you start it off
at that level--

37:21.319 --> 37:26.052
Well, what are we going to do
about that canine-loving ingenue?

37:26.090 --> 37:29.025
- Did you cast her because
you thought she was attractive?
- She's pretty...

37:29.093 --> 37:32.722
but more importantly, she has a certain
perkiness that the character requires.

37:32.797 --> 37:36.699
She's perky. She makes you
wanna sneak up behind her with
a pillow and suffocate her.

37:36.768 --> 37:39.134
- It's a beautiful apartment.
- Josette.

37:39.203 --> 37:42.036
- My beaker of martinis.
- Your taste is exquisite.

37:42.073 --> 37:46.533
My taste is superb.
My eyes are exquisite.

37:46.611 --> 37:48.738
What justifiable confidence.

37:48.780 --> 37:52.341
- I think at some point you're
going to have to fire Olive.
- I'm afraid that's not possible.

37:52.584 --> 37:57.146
Oh, how can you take her butchering
your poetry? I know I couldn't stand it.

37:57.221 --> 38:01.317
No one in his right mind is
going to believe she's a doctor,
not even a veterinarian.

38:01.559 --> 38:04.619
I understand, but it's a compromise
I have to live with...

38:04.696 --> 38:07.096
and if I want the play to open,
I have to find a way to live with it.

38:07.165 --> 38:09.690
I plan on reducing the scope of her role
if her bodyguard will let me.

38:09.767 --> 38:11.701
Can you believe
that character?

38:11.769 --> 38:14.863
Imagine, traveling with
your own private Neanderthal.

38:14.939 --> 38:17.874
- I wasn't aware that you opened
The Master Builder.
- Oh, well.

38:17.942 --> 38:21.173
I had forgotten that
you won that drama award.

38:21.245 --> 38:24.112
- Here's to your play.
- Oh, thank you. Our play.

38:24.148 --> 38:27.982
To an ideal world
with no compromise.

38:32.290 --> 38:35.259
Oh, my gosh,
look at this view!

38:35.326 --> 38:40.059
A million blinking lights.
A million broken hearts.

38:40.131 --> 38:42.656
- You know what's down there?
- What?

38:42.734 --> 38:45.794
- Broadway.
- Ah. That's your street.

38:45.870 --> 38:50.933
Mm-hmm. Yes, that's my street,
but I'd like to give it to you.

38:51.009 --> 38:54.968
- That is, if you want it.
- Who wouldn't want it?

38:55.046 --> 38:58.812
I want you to write a play for me.
Oh, I mean when all this is over.

38:58.850 --> 39:02.650
- Really?
- Your next play, I want you to create
a vehicle for Helen Sinclair.

39:02.720 --> 39:05.917
- I'm honored.
- But it must have size...

39:05.990 --> 39:08.117
an important woman.

39:08.192 --> 39:11.855
- A Borgia. A Curie. You name it.
- Yes!

39:11.929 --> 39:14.864
- I'll dedicate myself to it.
- Oh, and while you're at it...

39:14.932 --> 39:18.197
if you could just have
a look at that scene in Act ll.

39:18.236 --> 39:22.434
If she succeeds in seducing
the Lieutenant instead of
being rejected a second time...

39:22.674 --> 39:27.839
- it could add some variation
to the character.
- Yes, that's a wonderful idea.

39:27.879 --> 39:30.370
The heart is "labyrinthinine..."

39:30.448 --> 39:34.782
a maze beset with brutal pitfalls
and mean obstacles.

39:34.852 --> 39:39.255
David, I can't say that line. It doesn't
make sense. It's stupid. I don't get it.

39:39.323 --> 39:42.986
- It's just a stylish way
of expressing a particular idea.
- Idea? What idea?

39:43.061 --> 39:45.188
The agony of love.
The difficulty of relating.

39:45.229 --> 39:47.925
- Why do you have to make it
so hard to say?
- Just say the line.

39:47.999 --> 39:50.991
- No, I can't say it.
It's a mouthful of "ghibberish."
- Gibberish!

39:51.035 --> 39:53.833
- I can't say it, and I will not say it.
- Just do the line.

39:53.905 --> 39:55.839
No! I'm not making
a fool of myself.

39:55.907 --> 39:57.841
She's right, it stinks.

39:57.909 --> 40:00.343
Oh-ho, Jesus,
another party heard from.

40:00.378 --> 40:03.040
It's a stupid way of talkin',
and nobody talks like that.

40:03.114 --> 40:05.480
- I don't believe this is happening.
- Frankenstein is right.

40:05.717 --> 40:07.708
When I want your opinion,
I will ask for it.

40:07.752 --> 40:10.482
I can't stand to listen to this
garbage. Every day I sit back there...

40:10.722 --> 40:12.485
and I hear the same bullshit
over and over again.

40:12.724 --> 40:14.487
Then leave.
No one asked you here.

40:14.726 --> 40:16.387
Oh, David, take it easy.

40:16.427 --> 40:18.827
Where did you study play writing?
Was it Sing Sing?

40:18.896 --> 40:21.228
"A maze beset
by brutal pitfalls--"

40:21.265 --> 40:23.859
Hey, Olive, I memorized it,
and I'm tellin' ya...

40:23.935 --> 40:27.371
it comes to me all the time,
and it stinks on fuckin' hot ice!

40:27.438 --> 40:30.407
- That's it. I quit. This is crazy.
- David.

40:30.475 --> 40:34.172
- Oh, please, I have a little hangover!
- I am famished.

40:34.245 --> 40:37.305
Everyone, everyone,
why don't we take lunch? An hour?

40:37.381 --> 40:40.248
- You don't wanna
say the goddamned line...

40:40.284 --> 40:43.515
- don't say the goddamned line!
- Oh, look at you, Mr. Temperamental.

40:43.755 --> 40:47.350
 lf that rat on a leash
barks one more time--

40:47.425 --> 40:50.326
-He sounds melancholy. Is he melancholy?
-You can trim the line.

40:50.394 --> 40:53.852
- Because she can't handle it?
- Because you said yourself
you were having trouble with it.

40:53.931 --> 40:56.161
- So you agree with the gorilla?
- David, for Christ sake! It's one line!

40:56.234 --> 40:58.429
- It's not going to wreck the scene.
- That's not the point!

40:58.469 --> 41:01.927
Suddenly I'm taking suggestions from a
strong-arm man with an l.Q. of minus 50.

41:02.006 --> 41:03.974
I've had it!

41:04.008 --> 41:07.307
- David, for goodness' sake. Come on.
- Look who's here.

41:07.378 --> 41:10.211
Oh, God!
Get my rifle!

41:10.281 --> 41:13.808
I guess I'm just hypersensitive because
maybe deep down, I agree with the goon.

41:13.885 --> 41:18.288
- Maybe it is a turgid line.
I don't know. My nerves are shot.
- No. Just calm yourself.

41:18.322 --> 41:23.021
Helen, the play is not working.
It's not working, and it's in my
writing. It's not just Olive.

41:23.094 --> 41:27.292
That's the reason we have rehearsal.
That's the reason we go out of town.

41:29.267 --> 41:32.759
You have such a wonderful attitude.
I'm so lucky.

41:32.837 --> 41:35.465
The best part of this project every day
is that I get to come to work...

41:35.540 --> 41:38.441
and see you and be with you
and work with you.

41:38.509 --> 41:43.003
- I don't mean to spoil the day.
- Then let's not.

41:43.080 --> 41:46.379
Sit down here.
I'm going to show you something.

41:46.450 --> 41:48.350
Okay.

41:49.420 --> 41:52.287
This is my favorite spot
in the park.

41:54.292 --> 41:57.523
And in winter,
when it's covered with snow...

41:57.595 --> 42:02.294
at about 4:30 in the afternoon,
when it's just getting dark
and the lights come on...

42:02.333 --> 42:04.301
it's all misty.

42:04.368 --> 42:09.271
And you can just see the silhouettes of
the Manhattan skyline through the trees.

42:09.340 --> 42:11.831
And it's magical.

42:11.909 --> 42:14.241
It's magical.

42:15.980 --> 42:18.574
Helen, I think I'm falling
in love with you.

42:18.816 --> 42:20.613
Don't.

42:20.852 --> 42:24.845
- I don't know if I can help it.
- David, please, we must be strong.

42:24.922 --> 42:28.483
I've kept a check on my feelings
for so long, but there's
so much that I want to say.

42:28.559 --> 42:31.153
- What are words?
- Oh, gosh.

42:31.229 --> 42:34.494
David, everything meaningful
is in some unexplainable form.

42:34.565 --> 42:38.831
It's-- It's more primordial
than mere language.

42:38.903 --> 42:41.269
- I'm not sure I follow that one.
- Oh, be silent.

42:41.339 --> 42:43.307
- Be silent.
- Helen--

42:43.374 --> 42:46.468
No, let's just sit here
holding our thoughts.

42:46.544 --> 42:49.377
Not revealing them.
Be still.

42:49.447 --> 42:54.214
Let the birds have their song.
Let ours for now remain unsung.

42:54.285 --> 42:56.412
You're amazing.

43:03.561 --> 43:05.256
Stop it.
Stop it.

43:05.329 --> 43:08.059
- I'm not in the mood!
- What do you mean
you're not in the mood?

43:08.132 --> 43:10.327
Honey, you better get in the mood,
'cause he's payin' the rent.

43:10.401 --> 43:14.235
Shut up, Venus!
Just what I said: I'm not in the mood.

43:14.305 --> 43:18.901
- Do I have to be in the mood
every time you are?
- Stop puttin' on the airs.

43:18.943 --> 43:22.242
- I'm not puttin' on airs.
- I never knew you when you wasn't
ready for a little action.

43:22.280 --> 43:26.239
Well, today, I'm not ready for action.
I'm tired. Rehearsal is hard.

43:26.317 --> 43:29.377
- Get your motor goin'.
- No!

43:29.453 --> 43:32.581
- Hey, I brought you somethin'.
- What?

43:32.657 --> 43:35.888
- Huh?
- Hmm.

43:35.960 --> 43:37.928
What do ya say?
Come on.

43:37.962 --> 43:41.022
- Nickie.
- Oh, I got a great bottle
of French wine.

43:41.098 --> 43:43.066
Joey Foster
made it himself.

43:43.134 --> 43:45.602
Pasadena. I'm pooped.

43:51.275 --> 43:53.641
Today, Ellen came
to watch rehearsal.

43:53.711 --> 43:57.374
She was very excited to meet the cast,
especially Warner Purcell.

43:57.448 --> 44:02.181
- Warner, Warner, Warner.
This is Ellen. My girlfriend.
- Oh! Pleased to meet you.

44:02.253 --> 44:06.053
- You should be very proud.
He has a rare talent.
- Yes, he does.

44:06.123 --> 44:08.990
The morning proceeded
very smoothly for the first half hour.

44:09.026 --> 44:10.994
And then
another incident occurred.

44:11.062 --> 44:15.089
The heart obeys
its own rules. Ha!

44:15.166 --> 44:19.626
As a doctor, your respect for
rationalities is not very profound.

44:19.704 --> 44:21.638
- David, l-- David, can l--
- Yes?

44:21.706 --> 44:25.472
I don't understand the character here.
Suddenly, she's too wise.

44:25.543 --> 44:29.707
And, David, I don't know why she's
telling her to dump her fiance.

44:29.947 --> 44:32.313
- She's caught up with the Lieutenant.
- The Lieutenant?

44:32.350 --> 44:35.080
But it's as if she's just mouthing
the playwright's philosophy.

44:35.152 --> 44:38.349
- Why would she just up and leave Tom?
- Because she's impulsive.

44:38.389 --> 44:41.950
- It doesn't feel right.
- Well, yeah, and I don't
understand, you know...

44:42.026 --> 44:45.325
if I'm a doctor, how come
I'm giving her such bad advice?

44:45.363 --> 44:47.490
- It's not bad advice.
- It is bad advice.

44:47.565 --> 44:51.524
But, David, you see, in Act l,
she says that Tom changed her life.

44:51.602 --> 44:55.163
- Yes, but she's recklessly
driven to the Lieutenant.
- It doesn't make sense.

44:55.239 --> 44:57.537
- Just give it a chance.
- There's something
contradictory about it.

44:57.608 --> 44:59.974
- Just give it a chance.
- It's just bad writing.

45:00.044 --> 45:02.672
I'll tell ya what's wrong.

45:02.747 --> 45:05.409
- Oh, Christ! Julian?
- Now let's wait a minute.

45:05.483 --> 45:09.317
- Let's not get into a situation here.
- She shouldn't leave the guy.

45:09.387 --> 45:11.514
She should stick with him.

45:11.589 --> 45:15.719
Then when the Lieutenant has
that fight with his wife and
walks out, he should notice her.

45:15.793 --> 45:18.455
That way,
it won't be boring.

45:26.737 --> 45:30.173
Somebody say something!

45:30.207 --> 45:33.699
- I think it's a good idea.
- It's not a bad one.

45:33.778 --> 45:36.008
- You're kidding.
- Oh, no.

45:36.080 --> 45:38.241
It's, uh--
It really isn't.

45:38.315 --> 45:41.284
 Personally, I like it.
I think it's very dramatic.

45:41.352 --> 45:44.344
Ellen, do you see what I'm up against?
Do you see what I have to put up with?

45:44.422 --> 45:47.323
- I think he has an interesting concept.
- What?

45:47.391 --> 45:49.586
Not to say that--

45:49.660 --> 45:52.151
- She doesn't leave the Lieutenant.
- Right.

45:52.229 --> 45:54.254
- She doesn't leave her fiance.
- Right.

45:54.331 --> 45:57.630
We lose that scene, and suddenly
a lot of good possibilities open up.

45:57.701 --> 46:00.568
-  It's a helluva lot
better than what you got.
- I actually like it.

46:00.638 --> 46:03.129
- You're taking his side?
- It's not a question of sides.

46:03.207 --> 46:06.574
- David, she's right.
The play always bogged down there.
- Try it.

46:06.610 --> 46:10.569
- That's why the actors
always looked so uncomfortable.
- I can't make those changes.

46:10.614 --> 46:15.051
- Why not? H-H-How do they meet again?
- Because the--

46:15.119 --> 46:19.453
The Lieutenant notices her, right?
And then, he goes after her.

46:19.490 --> 46:23.449
I mean, that's the way
it would happen in real life.
He goes after her. Come on.

46:23.527 --> 46:27.725
You can't force it, kid. I mean, if it's
meant to go in a whole other direction--

46:27.798 --> 46:31.256
- I quit!
- Oh, don't be so egotistical.

46:31.335 --> 46:33.496
- I'm outta here.
- Egotistical? Why?
Because I protect my play?

46:33.571 --> 46:37.098
- Protect it against what? A good idea?
- Oh, thank you for the support.

46:37.141 --> 46:40.338
- No, no, I quit! That's it. Good-bye.
- I'm gonna go shoot crap.

46:40.411 --> 46:42.606
- That's it. I quit.
- Wait a minute.

46:42.646 --> 46:45.615
David. David!

46:45.649 --> 46:47.844
- I'm gonna go shoot crap.
- David.

46:48.085 --> 46:51.282
- Mommy's coming.

46:51.355 --> 46:56.315
If an artist can, it gives us all a
much better chance, and he is an artist.

46:56.360 --> 46:59.761
- Is that why he's getting all hot
and bothered all the time?
- Artists are very emotional.

46:59.830 --> 47:02.594
- Artists are emotional, are they?
- Yes, they are.

47:02.633 --> 47:05.431
Hey, I've been meaning
to ask ya...

47:05.503 --> 47:10.270
is it my imagination
or are you always... Iookin' my way?

47:10.341 --> 47:13.310
- You're a very observant girl.
Yes, I have been looking at you.
- Thank you.

47:13.344 --> 47:16.336
Yeah, well, I notice somethin'.
I notice you have...

47:16.380 --> 47:19.645
a really
big appetite.

47:19.717 --> 47:23.153
- Yes, I do have a big appetite.
- Yeah, I noticed that, but--

47:23.220 --> 47:25.279
- Where's your baby-sitter?
- What, Cheech?

47:25.356 --> 47:28.325
- Yes.
- Ah, you don't have to worry
about Cheech. He took off.

47:28.392 --> 47:32.419
- Did he?
- A minute there's a chance,
he runs off to play craps.

47:32.496 --> 47:35.897
- Takes about two hours.
- Well, listen, now that
you've been let off the leash...

47:36.133 --> 47:38.601
- Yeah?
- why don't we go in...

47:38.669 --> 47:41.934
- and get to know each other
a bit better?
- Okay.

47:42.173 --> 47:44.698
That might be pleasant.

47:49.713 --> 47:51.374
- 
- Well.

47:51.448 --> 47:53.382
- Hi.
- Hi.

47:53.450 --> 47:55.645
Hi.

47:58.355 --> 48:00.915
- You're a very attr--
Wait just a minute.
- What? What? What?

48:02.526 --> 48:04.790
- Before we start--
- Yeah?

48:04.862 --> 48:07.160
- What? Oh.
- Just a--

48:07.231 --> 48:10.257
A little poultry.
Okay.

48:10.334 --> 48:12.268
- All right. Let's go.
- All right.

48:12.336 --> 48:14.827
You do have a big appetite.

48:14.905 --> 48:18.363
- Pull yourself together.
So he came up with a good idea.

48:18.409 --> 48:20.843
- Helen, not you too?
- If you did follow his suggestion...

48:20.911 --> 48:24.176
you'd be able to put in that new scene
in Act Ill that you've always wanted to.

48:24.248 --> 48:28.184
- Yes, but it'd--
- And that, that casts
a whole new light...

48:28.252 --> 48:30.652
on my relationship
with my husband. Yes!

48:30.721 --> 48:33.349
So you're saying
you want me to change it?

48:33.424 --> 48:36.825
At the risk of seeing you
upset on your birthday.

48:36.894 --> 48:39.556
- How did you know it was my birthday?
- Happy birthday.

48:39.630 --> 48:42.827
- Helen! Ohh.
- Open it.

48:42.900 --> 48:45.494
Gosh!

48:45.569 --> 48:48.868
Oh, gosh.
Really. It's--

48:48.939 --> 48:51.669
Don't get too excited.
I didn't buy it.

48:51.742 --> 48:54.711
Cole Porter gave it to me.
It's one of many.

48:54.778 --> 48:57.372
- Now I'm gonna have to take up smoking.
- Hmm.

48:57.448 --> 49:00.508
Have a good time tonight
with your girlfriend.
I'm sure she's taking you out.

49:00.584 --> 49:04.680
- Yes, with the Marxes.
- Yes, well... make a birthday wish.

49:04.755 --> 49:09.556
- I have.
- I hope you get everything
in life that you want.

49:09.627 --> 49:11.561
Helen, have you thought
about what I said before...

49:11.595 --> 49:13.825
- about the way I feel?
- Don't speak.

49:15.032 --> 49:18.365
- But I want to express--
- Don't speak. Don't.

49:19.937 --> 49:21.871
- Just a few things I want to tell you.
- Don't speak.

49:21.939 --> 49:24.874
- When we first met--
- No, no. Don't speak.

49:24.942 --> 49:28.002
Please don't speak.
Please don't speak.

49:28.245 --> 49:30.975
No! No!
No! Go!

49:31.048 --> 49:34.882
Go, gentle Scorpio, go!

49:34.952 --> 49:39.321
Your Pisces wishes you
every happy return.

49:40.024 --> 49:42.322
- Just one--
- Don't speak!

49:44.695 --> 49:48.654
- 
- Wow, a wallet!

49:48.699 --> 49:51.691
- That's appropriate.
- It was the nicest one I saw by far.

49:51.769 --> 49:55.034
- The piping. That's real leather.
- Places to put stuff in there.

49:55.272 --> 49:57.069
- You like it?
- It's amazing. Beautiful.

49:57.308 --> 49:59.299
- You like it?
- Yes, really.

49:59.343 --> 50:03.302
- Now all I need is some money,
and it'll hold its shape.
- You will prosper, my friend.

50:03.347 --> 50:06.544
- I promise. 
Am I right, Hilda?
- No, I love it.

50:06.617 --> 50:09.984
- Can I pick 'em or can I pick 'em?
- Oh, you sure can, Julian.

50:10.054 --> 50:13.046
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you. Thank you.
Thanks for spending it with me.

50:13.290 --> 50:15.622
- Oh, it's wonderful.
- Hilda, touch glasses there.

50:19.063 --> 50:22.624
Hey, look who's here
with his girlfriend.

50:22.700 --> 50:25.965
- Oh, no.
- I owe that big Gorgonzola an apology.

50:26.036 --> 50:30.632
What are you talking about?
Now that he's drunk, he's gonna
apologize to everyone. Strangers.

50:30.674 --> 50:34.940
Today at rehearsal,
he came up with that little
suggestion, and I overreacted.

50:35.012 --> 50:38.812
I let my ego get in the way of the work,
and I feel I owe him an apology.

50:38.882 --> 50:42.409
- Ah, you're all right.
You handled it very well.
- I'll be right back.

50:50.427 --> 50:53.658
I take it all back. It was a good
suggestion, and I apologize.

50:53.731 --> 50:55.722
- Say hello to Violet.
- Hi, Violet.

50:55.799 --> 50:58.461
- Hi, nice to meet you.
Who's this, Cheech?
- He's a writer.

50:58.535 --> 51:02.403
- I'm a struggling writer.
- You wanna know what the problem
with your story is?

51:02.473 --> 51:06.534
- What's the problem?
Are you gonna do some more rewrites?
- Sit down. Take a load off your feet.

51:06.577 --> 51:10.343
- Moe, go on. Come here. Get him a beer.
- Why not?

51:10.381 --> 51:12.372
- He's a writer?
- Yeah.

51:12.416 --> 51:15.715
- I didn't know you knew writers.
- Do me a favor. Shut up.

51:15.786 --> 51:17.720
Don't tell me
to shut up.

51:17.755 --> 51:20.121
All right,
number one.

51:20.357 --> 51:23.485
See, I don't believe she loves
the guy right from the start.

51:23.560 --> 51:27.018
She's too on, uh, top of him
all the time. That's not love.

51:27.097 --> 51:30.897
That's like keeping somebody in prison.
But if you changed it, right?

51:30.968 --> 51:33.766
And she left him,
then she would feel so bad about it...

51:33.837 --> 51:37.705
- that she would have the
nervous breakdown and go nuts.

51:37.775 --> 51:40.539
- How ya doin', Cheech?
- Tulio, listen, I gotta see you later.

51:40.611 --> 51:44.069
- I wanna get down on the Cardinals
for the doubleheader, all right?
- You got it.

51:44.148 --> 51:48.414
- Them birds look good.
- Teach your friend some manners
and get him outta here.

51:48.452 --> 51:50.943
- All right, so--
- You were-- You were talking about--

51:51.021 --> 51:53.615
Right, all right.
So, now...

51:53.690 --> 51:57.751
if the doctor feels what Sylvia's
feelin'-- That's her name, Sylvia.

51:57.828 --> 52:00.160
- There's a Sylvia in my neighborhood.
- Oh, yeah?

52:00.397 --> 52:03.662
-Yeah. What was her name? Sylvia Pincus.
-Sylvia Pincus.

52:03.734 --> 52:06.498
Sylvia Pincus. Big, fat Jewish broad,
had a little tiny husband.

52:06.570 --> 52:09.403
She chopped him up with an ax and mailed
his pieces all over the country.

52:09.473 --> 52:11.805
I don't know what
she was tryin' to prove.

52:11.875 --> 52:13.809
That's disgusting. You gotta
tell that story in front of me?

52:13.877 --> 52:15.504
- Relax.
- You know I got a weak stomach.

52:15.579 --> 52:18.047
- You were tellin' me
about the play a minute ago.
- Don't interrupt me.

52:18.115 --> 52:21.050
- You were sayin' about Sylvia?
- Right. So if the doctor feels
what Sylvia's feelin'--

52:21.118 --> 52:23.109
- Uh-huh.
- Know what I mean?

52:23.187 --> 52:26.156
Yeah. She identifies
with her patient, a bit.

52:26.190 --> 52:29.990
Right. This way when she gets jealous,
it makes sense.

52:30.027 --> 52:31.961
- Right.
- Uh-huh.

52:32.029 --> 52:34.827
There's gotta be a time when the
Lieutenant has it out with the doctor.

52:34.898 --> 52:36.832
Why isn't that in there?

52:36.900 --> 52:39.027
You're talking about a whole
different direction for the play.

52:39.102 --> 52:41.036
Definitely.

52:42.773 --> 52:44.707
Think about it.

52:44.775 --> 52:48.541
How would the audience know
Sylvia was feeling guilty? lf--

52:48.612 --> 52:50.773
Oh. I don't know.

52:50.848 --> 52:52.816
Wait a minute.
Yeah. Wait.

52:52.850 --> 52:56.809
You could work it out with maybe you--
you hear what she's thinkin'.

52:56.854 --> 52:59.789
-You mean she speaks her thoughts aloud?
-Sure, why not? It's a play anyhow.

52:59.857 --> 53:02.951
It don't have to be real,
but it'll be stronger.

53:02.993 --> 53:06.793
You think about that.
And you, don't interrupt me no more.

53:06.864 --> 53:08.798
I'm sorry.

53:10.567 --> 53:15.163
So how come you had so much
to say to that Valenti goon?

53:15.239 --> 53:17.707
No, nothing. I was just
thanking him for his ideas.

53:17.741 --> 53:21.802
- What ideas? He only had
the one suggestion, didn't he?
- Yeah.

53:21.879 --> 53:24.848
- That was just it.
- So do you like your wallet?

53:24.882 --> 53:26.850
- What?
- The wallet.

53:26.884 --> 53:29.182
- Oh, yes, yes, it's terrific.
- Are you sure?

53:29.219 --> 53:32.746
Oh, it's very exciting. I love
leatherette. Always have loved it.

53:32.823 --> 53:35.155
Boy, are you loaded.

53:35.225 --> 53:37.216
- Yeah.
- Happy birthday.

53:37.294 --> 53:39.228
Thanks.

53:41.565 --> 53:46.502
September 24. I gave the cast
the rewrites. Everyone seemed pleased.

53:46.570 --> 53:49.266
-  These are brilliant! Oh!
-  They are.

53:49.506 --> 53:51.497
Now Sylvia's
not so passive.

53:51.575 --> 53:55.534
She uses her wiles to trap
the Lieutenant, and that's
what causes her guilt!

53:55.612 --> 53:58.046
 The whole thing is motivated.
It drives on. Wonderful.

53:58.115 --> 54:01.642
- You mean I gotta
memorize all new lines?
-  They're wonderful!

54:01.718 --> 54:05.950
- How did you come up
with such divine changes?
- They're not really mine--

54:06.023 --> 54:09.959
- Oh, no? Whose are they, God's?

54:10.027 --> 54:13.758
- Well, they are mine
in the sense that they're mine--
- Your modesty becomes you.

54:13.830 --> 54:15.991
But let's face it;
you are a major talent.

54:16.066 --> 54:18.125
A major new voice
in the theater.

54:18.201 --> 54:21.728
The word genius gets thrown around
so frequently in this business...

54:21.772 --> 54:24.206
- but, darling, if the shoe fits--
- Congratulations.

54:24.274 --> 54:28.210
- It finally has balls.
- Now, if we can do something
about Act Ill...

54:28.278 --> 54:30.678
we got a big, fat hit
on our hands.

54:30.747 --> 54:34.581
-  Three cheers
for the writer! Hip-hip--
- Hooray!

54:34.618 --> 54:37.815
I stayed up all night
working on the third act.

54:37.888 --> 54:39.822
I admit it came rather hard...

54:39.890 --> 54:43.121
and before I handed in the pages,
I sent them over to Cheech to read.

54:43.193 --> 54:45.923
He suggested I come down
to his office.

54:50.067 --> 54:52.661
- You missed the idea.
- I did?

54:52.736 --> 54:55.296
Yeah, you did.
Plus, nobody talks like that.

54:55.372 --> 54:58.808
- You got that problem.
You don't write like people talk.
- I take poetic license.

54:58.875 --> 55:03.574
Poetic license, bullshit.
People believe what they see
when the actors sound real.

55:03.647 --> 55:06.616
- Come here. Let me show you.
- What are you doing?

55:06.683 --> 55:08.674
- What does it look like I'm doin'?
- You're gonna write it?

55:08.752 --> 55:12.950
What am l? A fuckin' idiot?
They taught me how to write in
school before I burned it down.

55:12.990 --> 55:17.120
- You burned down your school?
- Yeah, it was Lincoln's birthday.
There was nobody there.

55:17.194 --> 55:20.220
- If you actually write--
- Look, I know how people talk,
all right?

55:20.297 --> 55:22.265
Go shoot a rack,
and let me do this.

55:22.299 --> 55:25.097
But if you actually write it,
then I'm not--

55:25.168 --> 55:27.659
- Don't worry about it.
I ain't gonna tell anybody.
- No?

55:27.738 --> 55:30.673
No. I saw you playin' the big shot.
I know what it's all about.

55:30.741 --> 55:33.141
Where I come from,
nobody squeals.

55:38.849 --> 55:41.010
Go shoot a rack.

55:41.084 --> 55:43.416
Stop starin' at me.

55:43.654 --> 55:47.613
 What dialogue!
This is better than O'Neill!

55:47.691 --> 55:49.181
Max Anderson
will never touch you!

55:49.259 --> 55:51.193
So you liked it.

55:51.261 --> 55:55.061
It's so full of passion!
It's so full of life!

55:55.132 --> 55:59.125
- I hoped it would lift the story.
- What a difference between this
and your first draft.

55:59.202 --> 56:04.162
You hadn't found yourself yet. The idea
was there, but it hadn't crystallized.

56:04.241 --> 56:07.039
You needed to hear it
on its feet, and now this.

56:07.110 --> 56:10.136
It's no longer tepid
and cerebral.

56:10.180 --> 56:14.014
It's full of life!
It's full of passion!

56:14.084 --> 56:18.111
It reeks with humid sexuality!
It's carnivorous at last!

56:18.188 --> 56:22.716
- You thought my first draft
was cerebral and tepid?
- Only the plot and dialogue.

56:22.793 --> 56:26.820
- But this--
- Was-Was-Was there nothing
in the original draft...

56:26.897 --> 56:28.865
that you feel
is worth saving?

56:28.899 --> 56:32.164
The stage directions were lucid.
Best I've ever seen.

56:32.202 --> 56:34.898
- And the color of the binder.
Good choice.
- Thank you.

56:34.971 --> 56:37.030
I always had a flare
for stage directions.

56:37.107 --> 56:41.339
I went back and reread your
earlier plays. They suffered
from the same problem.

56:41.378 --> 56:45.075
- 
- Good ideas, but
too contrived, no real guts.

56:45.148 --> 56:47.139
It's like you
finally happened.

56:47.217 --> 56:49.481
- Helen, I have a confession to make.
- Yes?

56:52.122 --> 56:54.420
- I--
- Don't speak!

56:54.491 --> 56:57.221
No, no, don't speak.
I know you wanna deprecate yourself.

56:57.294 --> 57:01.697
I know you do, but you're
going to take this town by storm.

57:05.936 --> 57:08.063
I didn't...

57:09.339 --> 57:12.035
realize what
an inspiration...

57:12.075 --> 57:14.373
you've been
to my writing.

57:14.444 --> 57:16.935
Oh, David.

57:16.980 --> 57:19.278
Dear, dear David.

57:19.349 --> 57:22.375
Pungent,
seething artist.

57:22.419 --> 57:25.252
The cocoon
has opened.

57:30.160 --> 57:33.960
I would give my body freely to
the man who wrote those words.

57:34.030 --> 57:38.057
Those glorious,
powerful words.

57:38.135 --> 57:40.069
- Helen--
- No, don't speak.

57:40.137 --> 57:43.436
- Don't speak. Don't speak.
No. Silence. Silence.

57:43.507 --> 57:46.374
- Don't speak.
- Please.

57:49.746 --> 57:53.204
September 28.
The play is working much better now.

57:53.283 --> 57:57.219
Helen has been getting on more
pleasantly with Eden, and I
believe she likes Mr. Woofles.

57:57.287 --> 58:00.916
- 
- Back! Back! Back! Back!

58:00.957 --> 58:04.791
Warner Purcell and Olive seem
to always be exchanging coy glances.

58:04.828 --> 58:08.286
I don't know if it's my imagination, but
he seems to have put on a little weight.

58:08.365 --> 58:14.167
Perhaps the tension of our
upcoming Boston opening has
caused him to cheat on his diet.

58:14.237 --> 58:16.432
Can we go
from "God of our fathers"?

58:19.976 --> 58:22.308
Take it from
"God of our fathers."

58:28.285 --> 58:33.587
 Oh! God of our fathers,
help me! Help me!

58:33.824 --> 58:37.920
I was thinkin' about
when Sylvia's in the crazy house--

58:37.994 --> 58:39.928
- Sanitarium.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:39.996 --> 58:42.829
- She gets the D.T.s,
and she sees things.
- She hallucinates.

58:42.866 --> 58:46.529
- No, she sees things.
You know, like visions.
- Like what kind of visions?

58:46.603 --> 58:50.937
- Like her dead husband,
and then they have that talk.
- The one in the third act?

58:51.007 --> 58:54.374
That's right. She couldn't
face up to him when he was alive.

58:54.444 --> 58:57.971
That's great. That's great.
That's great.

58:58.048 --> 59:00.380
- It is great.
- Why didn't I think of that?

59:01.451 --> 59:03.419
Joe,
gimme a beer.

59:11.294 --> 59:14.320
That's great.
It's all great.

59:14.397 --> 59:16.365
What's the matter?

59:16.399 --> 59:18.560
Nothin'. I just gotta
take a break for a minute.

59:18.635 --> 59:20.967
- You wanna take a break?
- Yeah.

59:21.037 --> 59:24.973
- All right.
- Got a cramp.

59:28.144 --> 59:30.339
Man.

59:30.380 --> 59:33.577
It's a nice-- nice spot.

59:33.650 --> 59:35.584
- Come here a long time.
- Yeah?

59:35.652 --> 59:38.314
- Yeah.
- You from around here?
You live around here?

59:38.388 --> 59:41.619
- New York, born and raised.
West 45th Street.
- Mmm.

59:44.427 --> 59:47.225
- Got a big family?
- No.

59:47.297 --> 59:49.993
Got a sister who
lives in Jersey.

59:50.066 --> 59:52.967
I had a brother,
but he got killed.

59:53.036 --> 59:56.096
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

59:56.172 --> 01:00:00.871
He welshed on some Shylocks.
They took him out to Canarsie,
shot him through the head.

01:00:00.944 --> 01:00:02.912
Your brother?

01:00:06.283 --> 01:00:09.275
How'd you get into
your line of work?

01:00:09.352 --> 01:00:11.286
- My line of work?
- Yeah.

01:00:11.354 --> 01:00:13.584
My father.
Was he tough.

01:00:15.392 --> 01:00:18.122
You ever think about
doin' anything else?

01:00:18.194 --> 01:00:20.128
- Like what?
- Like writing.

01:00:20.196 --> 01:00:22.130
- Writing.
- Yeah.

01:00:22.198 --> 01:00:24.666
- Come on, I've been collecting
for the Mob since I was 16.
- You have a huge gift.

01:00:24.901 --> 01:00:29.304
- Yeah.
- No, I'm serious.
Really, it's-- it's uncanny.

01:00:29.372 --> 01:00:32.967
- I mean, your instincts.
Dramatic instincts.
- Listen to me.

01:00:33.043 --> 01:00:36.012
- Your play was very good.
Your play was very good.
- Really enviable.

01:00:36.079 --> 01:00:39.242
You just didn't use your head.
Sometimes people don't think.

01:00:41.051 --> 01:00:43.212
Well, sure, for you
it's simple, you know?

01:00:43.286 --> 01:00:48.223
To someone who can draw, it all seems
logical, but for someone who can't--

01:00:48.291 --> 01:00:51.283
I studied playwriting
with every teacher. I read every book.

01:00:51.361 --> 01:00:53.295
Let me tell you about teachers.
I hate teachers.

01:00:53.363 --> 01:00:56.628
Those blue-haired bitches used to
whack us with rulers. Forget teachers.

01:00:56.666 --> 01:01:00.329
- There was a boy I knew when I was
growing up, and he played accordion.
- Yeah?

01:01:00.403 --> 01:01:04.203
I loved accordion. And I practiced
and practiced, and I got fluent.

01:01:04.274 --> 01:01:08.301
Yet he would squeeze one single note,
and the sound of it would make you cry.

01:01:08.378 --> 01:01:11.108
-I used to want to dance. You know that?
-Make you cry.

01:01:11.181 --> 01:01:15.447
- I mean it.
You ever see George Raft dance?
- Oh, yeah.

01:01:22.459 --> 01:01:24.393
- So--
- What?

01:01:24.461 --> 01:01:29.057
Mr. Marx says that you, uh, actually
rubbed a few people out. Is that true?

01:01:29.132 --> 01:01:31.623
- What is this, the third degree?
- Not at all.

01:01:31.701 --> 01:01:34.499
- Then why you sayin' that for?
- I'm just really--

01:01:34.537 --> 01:01:37.028
The truth is
I'm fascinated.

01:01:37.073 --> 01:01:40.201
- I took care of a few guys.
- Why?

01:01:40.276 --> 01:01:42.210
Why, why?
I don't know why.

01:01:42.278 --> 01:01:45.213
They cheated Mr. V. They went back
on a debt. I'll tell you one thing.

01:01:45.281 --> 01:01:48.216
I never rubbed out a guy
who didn't deserve it.

01:01:50.987 --> 01:01:56.391
Uh, so what does it actually
feel like when you actually...

01:01:56.459 --> 01:01:58.552
- What?
- k-kill a man?

01:01:58.628 --> 01:02:00.755
- It feels okay.
- It feels okay?

01:02:00.997 --> 01:02:04.057
- Yeah.
- Even the first time?

01:02:04.134 --> 01:02:07.194
First time?
First time was a punk in prison.

01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:10.637
He squealed on me, and I stuck
an ice pick in his back.

01:02:10.707 --> 01:02:12.698
- An ice pick?
- An ice pick, yeah.

01:02:12.776 --> 01:02:17.076
Had to do it over and over, 40 times.
It was a mess. Forget about it.

01:02:19.482 --> 01:02:23.009
Helen Sinclair gave a party.

01:02:23.053 --> 01:02:25.715
It was like being in a dream.
Maxwell Anderson was there...

01:02:25.789 --> 01:02:28.587
and George S. Kaufman
and Gertrude Lawrence.

01:02:28.658 --> 01:02:32.253
 Darling, I want you to meet
my playwright, David Shayne.

01:02:32.328 --> 01:02:36.025
Oh, you have
quite a find here, darling.
Word's all over the streets.

01:02:36.099 --> 01:02:39.068
Oh, well, Helen's made me out to be
quite a hero. You're too kind.

01:02:39.135 --> 01:02:41.296
No, I'm not kind.
Helen will vouch for that.

01:02:41.371 --> 01:02:44.101
But I read your play,
and it's nothing short of marvelous.

01:02:44.174 --> 01:02:46.438
I let him read the rewrite,
not the eunuch version.

01:02:46.509 --> 01:02:51.139
- My tongue is hanging out to
present it on the London stage.
- London?

01:02:51.214 --> 01:02:55.082
Look at his face, Helen. You're
going to be the toast of Broadway.

01:02:55.151 --> 01:02:57.142
Why not the West End, hmm?

01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:00.621
-Well, I'm so glad you enjoyed the show.
-It was extraordinary.

01:03:00.690 --> 01:03:03.284
What's this I hear
about Helen's latest? ls that true?

01:03:03.359 --> 01:03:06.760
- Oh, yes. He's creating
a vehicle for Helen for next season.
- Really?

01:03:06.830 --> 01:03:10.630
It's a little idea she's wanted to
do for years. She plays Jesus' mother.

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:12.634
- Oh!
- It's a whole Oedipal thing:

01:03:12.702 --> 01:03:16.103
He loves her, wants to do in the father.
Well, you can see the complications.

01:03:16.172 --> 01:03:19.141
- Of course.
- Of course, we're talking
to lra Gershwin...

01:03:19.175 --> 01:03:22.633
about a modern musical version
of The Hunchback of Notre Dame.

01:03:22.712 --> 01:03:27.479
- Quasimodo Jones.
- Helen has such a-a-a-- a new vitality.

01:03:27.550 --> 01:03:31.577
- Even her face looks so smooth.
- I know. The monkey glands are working.

01:03:36.493 --> 01:03:39.462
Can you leave
your purse here, or is it--

01:03:39.496 --> 01:03:42.522
- Why did you close the door?
- I've wanted to be alone with you...

01:03:42.599 --> 01:03:44.692
since this
boring party began.

01:03:44.767 --> 01:03:48.703
This party, boring?
This party's magnificent! It's glorious!

01:03:48.771 --> 01:03:51.501
Make love to me.

01:03:51.574 --> 01:03:53.804
Here? Now?

01:03:53.843 --> 01:03:58.405
- I see no reason to wait.
- Jerome Kern is on
the other side of the door.

01:03:58.481 --> 01:04:00.813
Yes, he's a wonderful composer.
You'll have to meet him.

01:04:00.884 --> 01:04:04.320
Now hang up your pants.

01:04:04.354 --> 01:04:07.585
I feel good today. You know, I went
to 34th Street. I got this new dress.

01:04:07.657 --> 01:04:09.591
- You like it?
- It's very nice.

01:04:09.659 --> 01:04:12.492
- Isn't it? I think we
should go dancin' tonight.
- We're gonna go dancin'.

01:04:12.529 --> 01:04:14.497
- I gotta take care of some business.
- Business now?

01:04:14.531 --> 01:04:17.523
- Oh, come on.
- I'll take you dancin' in
a minute. Just stay there.

01:04:17.567 --> 01:04:19.535
All right.

01:04:26.709 --> 01:04:30.577
- Hey, I wanna talk to you.
- Hi, Cheech! What are you doing here?

01:04:30.647 --> 01:04:34.413
Listen, usually I wouldn't give you
no warning, but you're a good actor.

01:04:34.484 --> 01:04:37.612
You're doin' a good job, and it'll
be a big problem if you're not around.

01:04:37.687 --> 01:04:41.589
But I'm tellin' you right now:
lf you go near Nick Valenti's
girl one more time...

01:04:41.658 --> 01:04:45.424
I'm gonna stick my gun in your mouth
and blow a hole in the top of your head.

01:04:45.495 --> 01:04:49.158
- All right?
- Cheech, it's so funny how you've
misconstrued the situation.

01:04:49.232 --> 01:04:52.531
Listen to me. I said don't give me
no shit now, you hear?

01:04:52.569 --> 01:04:54.833
- All right, all right.
- I know what's goin' on.

01:04:54.904 --> 01:04:56.838
- I understand, Mr. Cheech.
- You understand?

01:04:56.906 --> 01:05:00.273
- I do understand, yes.
- Next time I come back angry.
You hear what I said?

01:05:00.343 --> 01:05:03.278
- Yes, I understand.
- And next time you go near
her, you're a dead man.

01:05:03.346 --> 01:05:06.281
- Point taken. Thank you, thank you.
- Now get out of here.

01:05:17.193 --> 01:05:20.458
Mmm! Waiter!
Waiter.

01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:24.899
Could you bring me
some more potatoes, please?
And I'll have the pork loin now. Lovely.

01:05:24.968 --> 01:05:28.426
Thank you.
Oh, and one more thing.

01:05:28.504 --> 01:05:33.441
I'll have the cheese platter
now as well. Yes, and could you
save me the Nesselrode pie?

01:05:33.509 --> 01:05:35.409
Lovely.
Thank you.

01:05:37.547 --> 01:05:40.607
October 12.
We opened in Boston.

01:05:40.683 --> 01:05:43.345
Ellen came up for it.
Mr. Valenti was there.

01:05:43.419 --> 01:05:46.616
It went well, although my heart's
in my mouth every time Olive speaks.

01:05:46.689 --> 01:05:51.422
Don't tell me you still think
the world revolves around--

01:05:51.494 --> 01:05:53.826
- "You"!
- You.

01:05:53.896 --> 01:05:56.831
I saw Max Gordon in the lobby.
He loved it!

01:05:56.899 --> 01:06:00.960
- David, did you know
that I have a train to catch?

01:06:01.037 --> 01:06:05.337
- Hey, Dave, how was l?
- Wonderful. You finished
that whole speech this time.

01:06:05.408 --> 01:06:07.467
- Yeah, I did, didn't l?
- And much improved.

01:06:07.543 --> 01:06:11.502
You know, Olive was good.
She still needs work, but--
Hey, Charlie, how are ya?

01:06:11.581 --> 01:06:13.515
The first act seems
to be working well.

01:06:13.583 --> 01:06:18.384
- I got some flowers for ya.
- Oh, a hundred orchids!
They could only be from Billy Rose.

01:06:18.454 --> 01:06:22.686
Yes. They are! They're from Billy.
Oh, they're beautiful.

01:06:22.759 --> 01:06:25.455
And you!
Oh! Fabulous.

01:06:25.528 --> 01:06:29.055
Oh, thank you so much.
So sweet of you.

01:06:29.299 --> 01:06:32.860
Listen, let me go and get changed, and
then I'll meet you at the Lobster Grill.

01:06:32.935 --> 01:06:35.699
Could you order me
the shore dinner as an appetizer?

01:06:35.772 --> 01:06:37.706
And I'll have roast beef
as the main course.

01:06:37.774 --> 01:06:41.608
- How come you didn't
call me over the weekend?
- Oh, you were great.

01:06:41.644 --> 01:06:44.374
- I was busy, my dear. I'm busy now.
- Oh, really?

01:06:44.447 --> 01:06:47.439
- Excuse me. Could I just
have a word with you?
- No, my friends are up from town.

01:06:47.517 --> 01:06:51.510
- We're just going to eat,
and I've got to get changed.
- You don't mind if we talk.

01:06:51.587 --> 01:06:53.646
- We'll wait for you.
- We'll just be a second.

01:06:53.723 --> 01:06:58.353
- Oh, well, I'll be with you
in two seconds.
- Bye.

01:06:58.428 --> 01:07:03.991
- I can't be here. I mustn't--
- When I saw you on stage,
doing that big speech...

01:07:04.033 --> 01:07:08.060
- Olive, I'm very tempted.
You're a gorgeous girl.
- you were so, so sexy.

01:07:08.304 --> 01:07:11.330
- I mustn't be seen with you.
- What the hell is this?
A corset? Get it off.

01:07:11.407 --> 01:07:13.841
- Don't!
- What, what, what?
What are you so nervous about?

01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:17.971
- I can't be seen with you.
He threatened to kill me.
- Who threatened to kill you?

01:07:18.047 --> 01:07:21.847
- Cheech.
- Cheech threatened to kill you?

01:07:21.884 --> 01:07:24.876
Well, how do ya like that?
He finally got wise.

01:07:24.954 --> 01:07:28.014
You know what? I wouldn't let it
worry you if I were you.

01:07:28.057 --> 01:07:31.720
You're not the type to let some
strong-arm gorilla push you around.

01:07:31.794 --> 01:07:35.753
Olive, essentially, I'm an actor. I take
on certain roles that require of me--

01:07:35.832 --> 01:07:39.734
You weren't just an actor
when you were taking my underwear off.
You were a big shot.

01:07:39.802 --> 01:07:43.829
You were sayin' to me,
"Olive, I have big plans for you.
I want you to star with me.

01:07:43.906 --> 01:07:46.670
- Stop it. Listen, Olive--
- I make my own rules.

01:07:46.743 --> 01:07:48.870
All this is true,
but we must be realistic.

01:07:48.911 --> 01:07:53.610
- Realistic?
- God, I'm starving!
Do you have a sticky bun or--

01:07:53.683 --> 01:07:56.413
Open up. It's me, Nick.

01:07:56.486 --> 01:07:58.750
Nick?
Nick Valenti?

01:07:58.788 --> 01:08:03.851
- I'm dressing.
- Ah, c'mon. I ain't gonna see
noplace I ain't been before.

01:08:03.926 --> 01:08:07.555
- I'm coming, I'm coming.
Hold your water.

01:08:08.931 --> 01:08:11.399
- Hi, baby.
- Ah, there you are.

01:08:11.434 --> 01:08:14.164
- You were swell in
the show tonight, Olive.
- Well, thank you.

01:08:14.404 --> 01:08:16.167
- I thought so. Wasn't she, boys?
- Oh, yeah.

01:08:16.406 --> 01:08:18.703
- What a thrill.
- Come on. Get yourself dressed.

01:08:18.774 --> 01:08:22.676
- We got time to grab a drink
before I drive back to New York.
- Well, I don't know.

01:08:22.745 --> 01:08:25.645
- Not tonight, Nickie.
I'm a little bit tired.
- Come on, come on.

01:08:25.715 --> 01:08:27.841
You been puttin' me off
for weeks now.

01:08:27.917 --> 01:08:31.546
- I'm a little bit tired.
- Since when you too tired
to shovel in a little booze?

01:08:31.621 --> 01:08:34.613
What a marvelous audience. I thought
the show went quite well, don't you?

01:08:34.689 --> 01:08:39.593
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Valenti.
Darling, could you give me that
cue a little quicker in Act ll?

01:08:39.629 --> 01:08:42.723
You know the one where your character
is quoting Hamlet?

01:08:42.765 --> 01:08:45.928
Oh, well, you know, it's hard,
'cause I always forget the second part.

01:08:45.968 --> 01:08:49.495
Yes, I know.
It's "or not to be." Okay?

01:08:49.572 --> 01:08:52.803
Because I can't come in until you
finish your line, and I go "ooh."

01:08:52.875 --> 01:08:56.106
- To be--
- Or not to be.

01:08:56.145 --> 01:08:59.410
That's the way it goes. You're tired.
You're not taking it in.

01:08:59.482 --> 01:09:02.849
 And did you notice the
way the audience applauded your exit?

01:09:02.919 --> 01:09:06.649
It'll go better next time if you
make it through the doorway
and not the upstage wall.

01:09:06.721 --> 01:09:08.656
- Oh!

01:09:09.992 --> 01:09:12.426
Get the pooch outta here.

01:09:12.462 --> 01:09:15.590
Mr. Woofles.
Oh, he smells something.

01:09:15.665 --> 01:09:19.658
- You got somebody in there?
- Yeah, right, I got somebody in there.

01:09:19.734 --> 01:09:22.636
- Here, pooch, take a hike.
- Come on, darling. Protecting Mommy.

01:09:22.671 --> 01:09:25.232
- Bye-bye, bye-bye.
- What's he barkin' at?

01:09:25.475 --> 01:09:28.535
- I think you were talkin'
about the broad.
- All right, party's over.

01:09:28.611 --> 01:09:30.977
Come on, guys. Get outta here.
I gotta change.

01:09:31.046 --> 01:09:33.810
Nickie, you too.
One drink, all right? Let me change.

01:09:33.883 --> 01:09:36.750
- So who's this Hamlet guy?
- Come on. Outta here.

01:09:36.819 --> 01:09:38.979
- Go on, go on.
- Does he live around here?

01:09:39.055 --> 01:09:42.456
Hamlet. That's really
funny, honey. Bye.

01:09:42.492 --> 01:09:44.551
Go on! Get outta here. They're gone.

01:09:44.627 --> 01:09:47.220
Go on! Get outta here. They're gone.
Get outta here. Go on, go on.

01:09:47.462 --> 01:09:50.728
No, no, no! Not that way.
The window, the window.

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:52.961
Go on. The window.

01:09:53.002 --> 01:09:55.800
I'll be out
in a minute, Nick.

01:10:02.245 --> 01:10:05.578
-Oh, my goodness. Warner! Hello, Warner.
-It was a lovely performance.

01:10:05.648 --> 01:10:09.175
- Oh, thank you very much.
That's sweet of you.
- We enjoyed it so much.

01:10:09.252 --> 01:10:11.982
- Oh, yes, well, did you like the play?
- I loved the play.

01:10:12.054 --> 01:10:14.887
- It's a smashing part.
- The second act was wonderful.

01:10:14.957 --> 01:10:17.687
- Beautiful scene.
- It's lovely working
with Helen, of course.

01:10:17.727 --> 01:10:20.821
- She's so good. She's just lovely.
- She just carries one through.

01:10:20.863 --> 01:10:22.922
Could you possibly
give me an autograph?

01:10:22.999 --> 01:10:26.662
- I-l'd love to.
I don't have a pen on me.
- Oh, you don't?

01:10:26.736 --> 01:10:30.866
It's her. That's what it is. I can't
keep turnin' a blind eye. It's Olive.

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:32.908
She's better than
when we started.

01:10:32.975 --> 01:10:36.604
- Sure, she's better.
That don't mean she's good enough.
- Well, I mean, you know--

01:10:36.679 --> 01:10:38.943
- This is something
that just bothers you.
- Yeah.

01:10:39.015 --> 01:10:43.076
- The critics-- Her notices were decent.
- Decent ain't good enough.

01:10:43.152 --> 01:10:48.920
- She's killin' my words.
- Your words? Okay, she's
weaker, but it doesn't matter.

01:10:48.991 --> 01:10:52.518
- Weak? I think she's doin'
more damage than you think.
- What am I gonna do, fire her?

01:10:52.595 --> 01:10:54.654
- I can't have her ruinin' my show.
- Your show?

01:10:54.730 --> 01:10:58.063
- What are you talkin' about?
- All right, our show.

01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:01.001
- I put a lot into this.
It could be perfect.
- Yeah, so did l...

01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:03.004
but there's concessions
we have to make.

01:11:03.072 --> 01:11:06.041
- The show's a hit.
- She's not the best we could do
for the part.

01:11:06.108 --> 01:11:09.771
- There's plenty other girls around.
- What are we gonna do, Cheech?

01:11:09.845 --> 01:11:12.575
She throws the whole thing
out of whack. Can't you see it?

01:11:12.648 --> 01:11:14.912
- The audience doesn't
know the difference.
- Oh, they know.

01:11:14.984 --> 01:11:17.851
- They do not know.
- They don't know how to say it,
but they know.

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:21.617
Every time I hear that voice,
it's like a knife in my fuckin' heart.
She can't act!

01:11:21.691 --> 01:11:23.625
- You listening to me?
- Cheech, take a shower.

01:11:23.693 --> 01:11:27.060
She makes stuff not work. Stuff
she ain't even in comes out twisted.

01:11:27.129 --> 01:11:30.895
- I can't fire her! You know this!
- Don't yell at me.

01:11:30.933 --> 01:11:33.561
I am not yelling at you,
but you are too close to this.

01:11:33.636 --> 01:11:35.365
Leave me alone.
I got a fuckin' headache.

01:11:35.605 --> 01:11:37.766
- Leave me alone. I got a headache.
- You're being temperamental.

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.865
Very temperamental!

01:11:39.942 --> 01:11:42.001
Fate acts in strange ways.

01:11:42.078 --> 01:11:45.707
Everyone seems to be
feeling the pressure of
our upcoming New York opening.

01:11:45.781 --> 01:11:50.241
Yesterday, Warner got into a
fight with Eden, and the results
proved Cheech right yet again.

01:11:50.319 --> 01:11:54.085
There you are. Mr. Purcell,
you have been stealing our
dog yummies and eating them.

01:11:54.123 --> 01:11:56.353
Absolutely not.
That's an outrageous suggestion.

01:11:56.592 --> 01:11:59.186
- Then let me see in your pockets.
- Would I eat dog food?

01:11:59.261 --> 01:12:02.788
You'd eat anything that didn't eat
you first, you big fat pot of helium.

01:12:02.832 --> 01:12:05.596
- This is the sort of food I eat:
prime loin chop.
- Let me see.

01:12:05.668 --> 01:12:09.229
I do not steal from animals. Get out
of my trousers, you horrid woman.

01:12:09.305 --> 01:12:11.796
Look!
Oh, thief, thief, thief!

01:12:11.874 --> 01:12:14.104
It was you that drank
her saucer of milk yesterday.

01:12:14.143 --> 01:12:17.874
Ow! Ow!
You fat hunk of blubber!

01:12:17.947 --> 01:12:21.815
- She pushed me!
- Ow, my hand! That's 'cause
you were stealin' her dog food.

01:12:21.884 --> 01:12:25.684
Somebody ought to stick
a harpoon in you, you big whale.

01:12:25.755 --> 01:12:28.315
- Ow.
- I can get you a doctor.
I can get you a doctor.

01:12:28.357 --> 01:12:30.325
I guess this means
you'll miss the matinee.

01:12:30.359 --> 01:12:33.192
It's okay with me.
One show a day is plenty.

01:12:33.262 --> 01:12:35.753
To think I didn't
believe you at first, you dear--

01:12:35.831 --> 01:12:40.632
I think I can say this in the company
of-- in the company of all of you.

01:12:40.670 --> 01:12:45.801
That a woman of your age
should have leapt past the realm
of such acute narcissism.

01:12:54.383 --> 01:12:56.943
- What a difference with
a real actress saying those lines!
- All right.

01:12:57.019 --> 01:13:00.250
- The whole play came to life!
- Listen to me.

01:13:00.322 --> 01:13:04.952
Don't get carried away.
Don't get any ideas. Olive is going on.

01:13:05.027 --> 01:13:09.054
We can get all the backing
we need without Nick Valenti.
Our notices are wonderful.

01:13:09.131 --> 01:13:11.895
- People are standing--
- It's not the money. I told ya that.

01:13:11.967 --> 01:13:15.926
We dump Olive, you, me,
even the dog will wind up
at the bottom of the Hudson.

01:13:16.005 --> 01:13:20.339
It won't take that long.
He'll kill us here in Boston.
We'll be at the bottom of the Charles.

01:13:20.376 --> 01:13:23.675
He was right. She wrecks the whole play.
He noticed that.

01:13:23.746 --> 01:13:28.012
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. It's just that
she affects the whole play.

01:13:29.418 --> 01:13:32.410
- You were wonderful.
- Yes, yes. Wonderful.

01:13:32.488 --> 01:13:35.150
-  Have you seen
Deliah with my robe?
- Yes, she's coming.

01:13:35.224 --> 01:13:37.988
- Listen.

01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:41.427
- One thing you don't do
is welsh on Nick Valenti.
- On Nick Valenti.

01:13:41.497 --> 01:13:44.728
- In future productions,
we can hire somebody else.
- Shh-shh!

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:48.201
We can hire somebody else, but if she's
okay to open in New York, she opens.

01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:51.398
- I mean, the play must go on.
I'll do anything--
- She affected the whole thing.

01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:02.913
 I can't tell you
how many times I've seen it.

01:14:02.985 --> 01:14:04.953
A show comes into Boston...

01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:09.957
crippled, limping, struggling, gasping
for air, trying to find its own life...

01:14:10.025 --> 01:14:14.962
and then, somewhere along the line,
a miracle occurs.

01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:17.055
A work of art is born.

01:14:17.133 --> 01:14:20.899
- It's amazing how much better the show
is working with Olive's understudy.
- Mmm, Olive.

01:14:20.936 --> 01:14:22.904
- The thing's breathing and living.
- Yes, it's true.

01:14:22.938 --> 01:14:26.533
She's drab, but it's still
going to be a fine, fat hit.

01:14:26.776 --> 01:14:29.142
- Mmm.
- Here's to your future...

01:14:29.178 --> 01:14:32.238
as the new white knight
of the Great White Way.

01:14:33.783 --> 01:14:37.947
- Cheers.

01:14:37.987 --> 01:14:42.117
- What is this stuff?
- Paint remover. You can cut
it with a little club soda.

01:14:42.191 --> 01:14:44.125
- Oh, it's very smooth.
- Yes.

01:14:45.761 --> 01:14:47.558
See the little towns go by?

01:14:49.999 --> 01:14:53.457
Helen, when I get back to New York,
I'm gonna tell Ellen about us.

01:14:53.536 --> 01:14:55.970
- Oh, David!
- No, I've decided.

01:14:56.005 --> 01:14:58.974
- Oh, are you sure?
- You know how I feel about you.

01:14:59.008 --> 01:15:03.570
Oh, David, you must be gentle.
I-l-l've been hurt so many times before.

01:15:03.813 --> 01:15:06.441
I know.
I know.

01:15:06.515 --> 01:15:09.484
You stand on the brink
of greatness.

01:15:09.552 --> 01:15:14.990
The world will open to you like an
oyster. No. No, not like an oyster.

01:15:15.057 --> 01:15:18.322
The world will open to you
like a magnificent vagina.

01:15:22.131 --> 01:15:24.224
You okay?
You look a little flushed.

01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:26.825
- I've just had a little too much--
- Is it something I said?

01:15:26.869 --> 01:15:29.463
- No, just the paint remover.
- Oh.

01:15:33.008 --> 01:15:35.841
Have you ever thought about
whether, when you fall in love...

01:15:35.878 --> 01:15:39.006
do you fall in love with
the artist or the man?

01:15:40.983 --> 01:15:43.247
What a strange question.

01:15:43.319 --> 01:15:45.253
Yes, it is strange, but--

01:15:47.056 --> 01:15:51.959
I'm in love with you, Helen. I am, and
the time has come for me to act on it.

01:15:52.027 --> 01:15:55.053
Oh, the train
is moving so fast.

01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:58.588
Oh, David, it's so fast.
Oh, hold me!

01:15:58.834 --> 01:16:01.598
- Oh, hold me. No, no, don't speak.
- Helen, I love you.

01:16:01.837 --> 01:16:04.328
Don't speak.
B-- Uh, please, don't speak.

01:16:04.406 --> 01:16:07.204
- Don't speak. No. Don't speak.
- 

01:16:07.276 --> 01:16:09.244
No, please.

01:16:09.311 --> 01:16:13.839
- Are you having an affair
with Helen Sinclair?
- What? No!

01:16:13.883 --> 01:16:15.851
- Don't lie to me.
- What are you talking about?

01:16:15.918 --> 01:16:19.251
You two are in every gossip column in
town. You were all over Boston together.

01:16:19.321 --> 01:16:21.255
- You know those columns.
- All those late nights.

01:16:21.323 --> 01:16:23.348
- I was working!
- What about this?

01:16:23.425 --> 01:16:27.156
- That's a cigarette case I found.
I don't know where I found it.
- "To Helen from Cole.

01:16:27.229 --> 01:16:30.426
- Let's do it.
- I remember now. I admired it,
and she gave it to me.

01:16:30.499 --> 01:16:33.491
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Because there's nothing to tell, Ellen.

01:16:33.569 --> 01:16:37.972
Now that you're on the eve
of success, you want to dump me
and go off with Helen Sinclair.

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:41.032
- That is ri-- That is ridiculous.
- Are you sure?

01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:43.340
You know how crazy
you sound right now?

01:16:43.412 --> 01:16:46.904
- You never encouraged me
to stay in Boston.
- I was submerged in my work.

01:16:46.949 --> 01:16:50.043
The play's in trouble.
I'm working.

01:16:50.119 --> 01:16:52.212
Hey, it's me.
It's David.

01:16:52.288 --> 01:16:54.586
You know?
David? Okay?

01:16:56.458 --> 01:16:58.983
What an imagination
on this girl.

01:17:00.529 --> 01:17:04.158
Listen, Flender,
I'm completely mixed up.

01:17:04.233 --> 01:17:07.532
Ellen, Ellen. I love Ellen.
She's been with me the whole time.

01:17:07.603 --> 01:17:10.128
Stuck by me. I knew she'd
be happier back in Pittsburgh.

01:17:10.205 --> 01:17:12.230
- We've had a great relationship.
- Right.

01:17:12.274 --> 01:17:15.437
- I love her dearly. And yet--
- Yeah. Yes. Get to the point.

01:17:15.477 --> 01:17:18.674
What is the problem here? It's always
been clear that you've loved Ellen.

01:17:18.914 --> 01:17:22.475
I've become involved with
Helen Sinclair, and I feel terrible.

01:17:22.551 --> 01:17:27.454
But I can't help myself.
She's so charismatic, and
she's brilliant and beautiful.

01:17:27.489 --> 01:17:30.583
I mean, a real artist, and--
and we speak the same language.

01:17:30.659 --> 01:17:32.627
- You're wracked with guilt.
- I'm wracked with guilt.

01:17:32.661 --> 01:17:35.630
- You're wracked with guilt.
You are wracked with guilt.
- I don't know whether--

01:17:35.664 --> 01:17:40.158
- I can't sleep.
- Guilt is petit bourgeois crap.

01:17:40.235 --> 01:17:44.069
- An artist creates
his own moral universe.
- I know that. I know--

01:17:44.139 --> 01:17:48.075
Well? What is the problem then?
I'm gonna give you some advice.

01:17:48.143 --> 01:17:52.477
The same advice that was
given to me many years ago when
I had a very similar dilemma.

01:17:52.548 --> 01:17:54.641
- Similar to mine. To--
- Yes. Yes.

01:17:54.717 --> 01:17:56.685
What did you do?
What?

01:17:56.719 --> 01:17:59.483
You gotta do
what you gotta do.

01:18:27.416 --> 01:18:31.352
Listen, when she gets here, tell her
you're gonna give her some new lines.

01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:34.116
- You know, like we discussed.
- Yeah.

01:18:34.189 --> 01:18:37.556
Let me level with you, Mr. V.
Do you mind if I call you Nick?

01:18:37.626 --> 01:18:40.618
You see, Nick, you don't
fiddle with a winning show.

01:18:40.696 --> 01:18:43.563
Every script reaches a point where,
in the professional judgment...

01:18:43.632 --> 01:18:46.032
of the producer, the director,
you're finished.

01:18:46.068 --> 01:18:48.434
You can't distort the plot.

01:18:48.504 --> 01:18:52.235
Now, we're about ready to open.
Changes could be harmful.

01:18:52.307 --> 01:18:54.366
No, the show is
basically frozen.

01:18:56.512 --> 01:18:59.208
- Let's avoid confusion.
- Sure.

01:18:59.248 --> 01:19:01.216
She'll get some new
fuckin' lines...

01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:04.242
or I'll nail your kneecaps
to the dance floor.

01:19:06.655 --> 01:19:10.113
Imagine that director telling me
I'm overacting in the first scene...

01:19:10.192 --> 01:19:12.319
and I don't know
what I'm saying.

01:19:12.394 --> 01:19:16.194
You know what I'm doing, Cheech, is,
I'm working on a superior laugh. Like:

01:19:16.265 --> 01:19:19.530
Ha-ha-ha. Hee-hee-hee.

01:19:19.601 --> 01:19:24.334
I wanna throw that in when
Sylvia threatens to leave,
and then I burst into tears.

01:19:24.406 --> 01:19:29.207
Well, you know, he says no,
but what the hell kind of dull
show is he putting on anyway?

01:19:29.278 --> 01:19:32.714
- I don't know.
- Where we goin'? I thought
we were gonna go meet Nick.

01:19:32.781 --> 01:19:35.375
We have to go pick up Nick.

01:19:35.451 --> 01:19:39.148
We're gonna pick up Nick? You never
said nothin' about picking him up.

01:19:39.221 --> 01:19:42.588
- We just gotta meet him--
- I thought we were gonna
meet him at the club.

01:19:50.432 --> 01:19:55.165
How come I have to wear those
dowdy, brown, ugly dresses?
I don't understand--

01:19:55.237 --> 01:19:58.468
What are we doin' here?
I thought we were goin' to see Nick.

01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:00.508
Yeah, we are.
Nick's got a surprise for ya.

01:20:00.576 --> 01:20:03.136
- Nick's got a surprise for me?
- Yeah, come on.

01:20:03.212 --> 01:20:07.205
Come with me. You're gonna really like
it. This cost Nick a lot of dough to--

01:20:07.282 --> 01:20:11.150
- To do this for you. Come on.
- I don't-- I don't like this.

01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:15.418
I don't like this, Cheech.
I can't understand why Nick has
a surprise for me in a warehouse.

01:20:15.491 --> 01:20:17.550
He's not treatin' me
like a lady.

01:20:17.626 --> 01:20:21.528
-He's got a moonlight cruise.
-A moonlight cruise? I don't understand.

01:20:21.597 --> 01:20:24.122
- Just walk right over there.
Go ahead. He's over there.
- I don't--

01:20:24.166 --> 01:20:26.657
- Just walk over there. Olive!
- Nickie?

01:20:26.735 --> 01:20:30.364
- What?
- I think you should know this.
You're a horrible actress.

01:20:34.843 --> 01:20:39.507
- Thank God I don't have to hear
that voice anymore.

01:20:41.683 --> 01:20:45.141
October 25. We open tomorrow.

01:20:45.187 --> 01:20:47.348
Olive did not show up
for the run-through today.

01:20:47.422 --> 01:20:49.356
We tried calling her,
but there was no answer.

01:20:49.424 --> 01:20:52.621
It's possible her understudy might
have to do tomorrow's show.

01:20:52.661 --> 01:20:55.630
- Listen to this.
The whole thing's comin' to life.
- Yeah.

01:20:55.697 --> 01:21:00.191
- Maybe Olive's got stage fright.
Maybe she won't show.
- Not Olive.

01:21:00.269 --> 01:21:02.737
That dame doesn't have
a nerve in her body.

01:21:02.804 --> 01:21:05.898
I don't think her spinal cord
touches her brain.

01:21:06.141 --> 01:21:08.769
- Oh, God. Listen to this.
- Yeah.

01:21:08.844 --> 01:21:11.870
It's wonderful. Where's Cheech?
He'd know where she is.

01:21:11.947 --> 01:21:15.644
- He didn't come around.
- Look, I'm in love with the understudy.

01:21:15.717 --> 01:21:18.208
- It's so natural. It's--

01:21:18.253 --> 01:21:20.221
- Julian?
- Yeah?

01:21:20.255 --> 01:21:22.723
- Did you hear about Olive?
- Oh, what now?

01:21:22.791 --> 01:21:24.725
She got bumped off.

01:21:26.528 --> 01:21:28.962
- What?
- Out at the docks.

01:21:29.198 --> 01:21:31.428
A gangland hit.

01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:34.560
- I wanna talk to you.

01:21:34.636 --> 01:21:36.729
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

01:21:36.805 --> 01:21:39.205
Hey, Joe.
Get lost for a while.

01:21:39.274 --> 01:21:41.799
How could you?
How could you!

01:21:41.877 --> 01:21:43.811
- Nobody's gonna ruin my play.
- Oh-- Your play?

01:21:43.879 --> 01:21:46.712
- That's the second time
you called it your play.
- All right, our play.

01:21:46.782 --> 01:21:50.377
- Didn't it cut you up inside
to hear her say it? Huh?
- We would've survived it!

01:21:50.452 --> 01:21:53.888
Survived it? ls that what you want? When
we had a great thing, a thing of beauty?

01:21:53.956 --> 01:21:56.390
But, Cheech! To...
 ...kill her!

01:21:56.458 --> 01:21:58.983
- She was a tramp.
- It's a free country.

01:21:59.228 --> 01:22:01.560
- Then leave me alone.
- No, I will not leave you alone.

01:22:01.630 --> 01:22:05.930
Didn't anybody ever teach you that
it's morally wrong, that it's a sin to--

01:22:06.001 --> 01:22:07.935
Who am I talking to?
Jesus Christ!

01:22:08.003 --> 01:22:10.938
- The part works better
with the understudy.
- That's not the point.

01:22:11.006 --> 01:22:14.203
Let me see if I can explain this
to you in a way you'll understand.

01:22:14.243 --> 01:22:17.212
Let's say she was ruining
the play-- which she was not.
She was diminishing it.

01:22:17.279 --> 01:22:20.009
- She was ruining it.
- Let's say she was ruining the play.

01:22:20.249 --> 01:22:22.911
- Does that mean
that she deserves to die?
- There was no way to fire her.

01:22:22.985 --> 01:22:26.580
- What kind of inhuman monster are you?
- I think you'd better leave.

01:22:26.655 --> 01:22:28.919
I don't think I will.
I think I'd better stay.

01:22:28.957 --> 01:22:32.393
- You should be thanking me.
We're both in this together.
- No, we're not.

01:22:32.427 --> 01:22:36.591
I didn't want her dead. See?
You understand what I'm saying?
I'm not in anything.

01:22:36.665 --> 01:22:40.533
- You choose her over the show?
- Of course I do! Yes!

01:22:40.602 --> 01:22:44.231
You think it's right some
tootsie walks in and messes up
a beautiful thing like this?

01:22:44.273 --> 01:22:46.969
- I wanted a great play
as much as you did.
- No, not as much.

01:22:47.042 --> 01:22:49.476
- But you don't kill for it!
- Yeah? Who says?

01:22:49.544 --> 01:22:52.911
My father used to listen to the opera.
He loved the opera. But if a guy stunk--

01:22:52.981 --> 01:22:55.745
- What, he killed him?
- One time, in Palermo.

01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:03.687
I'm an artist too, not great
like you, but you know what?
First I'm a human being.

01:23:03.759 --> 01:23:07.286
- I'm a decent, moral human being.
- What are you doin' with
Helen Sinclair then?

01:23:07.329 --> 01:23:10.526
- What has that got to do
with it? How did you know?
- Everybody in town knows.

01:23:10.599 --> 01:23:13.067
Except maybe your girlfriend.
Who you think you're foolin'?

01:23:13.302 --> 01:23:16.738
I might not be perfect, but you're
a killer! You're a degenerate animal!

01:23:16.805 --> 01:23:19.968
You're a murderer! You b--
You belong in the electric chair!

01:23:20.008 --> 01:23:22.670
Listen to me, you.
You listen to me.

01:23:22.744 --> 01:23:26.043
Nobody, nobody is gonna
ruin my work, you hear me?

01:23:26.281 --> 01:23:28.044
Nobody, huh?

01:23:38.527 --> 01:23:41.496
I've fallen in love
with Helen Sinclair...

01:23:41.563 --> 01:23:45.499
and I lied to you about it
the other day, which I'm sure
that you probably knew.

01:23:45.567 --> 01:23:48.866
I want to let you know I didn't mean
for this to happen. It just happened.

01:23:48.904 --> 01:23:50.895
I'm not surprised.
She is extraordinary.

01:23:50.972 --> 01:23:54.066
- So are you. It's me
that's all screwed up.
- I have a confession to make.

01:23:54.309 --> 01:23:57.972
You knew the whole time,
but you were too damn decent
to confront me while I was--

01:23:58.046 --> 01:24:01.038
No, I've been seeing
Sheldon Flender.

01:24:01.116 --> 01:24:04.017
- Pa-Pa-Pardon me?
- We've been having an affair.

01:24:04.052 --> 01:24:07.886
- Did you say Sheldon Flender?
- Yes, he's been in love
with me for a long time.

01:24:07.956 --> 01:24:10.948
Do you know his theory that art
is relational, that it requires two--

01:24:11.026 --> 01:24:12.994
the artist
and the audience?

01:24:13.028 --> 01:24:15.053
- He feels that way about sex too.
- About-- About sex?

01:24:15.130 --> 01:24:18.361
Yes, between the two right people,
it can become an art form.

01:24:18.433 --> 01:24:22.597
Are you saying that you and
Flender have raised intercourse
to the level of an art form?

01:24:22.671 --> 01:24:24.605
Not just intercourse.
Foreplay too.

01:24:24.673 --> 01:24:27.369
- My friend, the unproduced playwright?
- He's been after me a long time.

01:24:27.409 --> 01:24:31.675
You never seem to want to get married,
and so, one night we went out,
had a few drinks...

01:24:31.747 --> 01:24:35.046
and started discussing art
and literature and Freud and Nietzsche.

01:24:35.083 --> 01:24:37.916
And in order to illustrate
a point on Greek etymology...

01:24:37.986 --> 01:24:39.920
I noticed he'd
unbuttoned his fly--

01:24:39.988 --> 01:24:43.355
No, no, no, no! Please, please!
I don't need to hear any more.

01:24:43.392 --> 01:24:46.793
But he's a major talent. You've
said so yourself a million times.

01:24:46.862 --> 01:24:50.821
With an intellect that big, you tend
to create your own moral universe.

01:25:13.054 --> 01:25:15.716
- I just wanted to wish you good luck.
- Oh, darling.

01:25:15.791 --> 01:25:18.919
You look pale.
No, no, not to worry.

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:23.624
Soon this town will belong to you.
We're having dinner Sunday night
with Gene O'Neill.

01:25:23.698 --> 01:25:27.691
He's heard that your writing
is morbid and depressing.
He's dying to meet you.

01:25:27.769 --> 01:25:29.703
- Oh, here's that brush.
- I know you'll be terrific tonight.

01:25:29.771 --> 01:25:33.036
Oh! They're your words.

01:25:33.108 --> 01:25:35.201
I'm just a vessel.

01:25:35.444 --> 01:25:38.106
You fill me.

01:25:38.146 --> 01:25:41.673
And this? This is
just the beginning.

01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:46.687
I've been discussing all kinds of new
ideas for vehicles for me with my agent.

01:25:46.755 --> 01:25:49.724
There's a variety of women
I can play. As you get to know me...

01:25:49.791 --> 01:25:52.487
you'll see there's no limit
to my range.

01:25:52.561 --> 01:25:55.792
They say that I can
still play late twenties...

01:25:55.831 --> 01:25:59.130
but I say no, no,
thirty tops.

01:25:59.167 --> 01:26:01.931
We'll go to my house
in the Vineyard. It's quiet there.

01:26:02.003 --> 01:26:04.597
You can write.
I'll bring you coffee.

01:26:04.639 --> 01:26:07.130
Listen, you better go.
I-l-lt's 15 minutes to curtain.

01:26:07.209 --> 01:26:09.700
I still haven't done
my breathing exercises yet.

01:26:09.778 --> 01:26:12.941
Y-Y-You-- Fate.
Fate has thrown us together.

01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:16.884
Merde.

01:26:33.502 --> 01:26:35.595
Take him.
Take him!

01:26:35.670 --> 01:26:39.037
Let him leave me bereft,
without a penny. Go ahead. Take him.

01:26:39.074 --> 01:26:42.601
But don't think it'll last forever.
The same thing'll happen to you.

01:26:42.677 --> 01:26:46.636
Sylvia, I don't know
why you're so unhappy.

01:26:46.715 --> 01:26:48.945
- Why you're such
a deeply unhappy person...
- Oh, God!

01:26:49.017 --> 01:26:51.918
- but I want you to know that--
- Because you're taking my husband...

01:26:51.987 --> 01:26:55.286
my life, the very core
of my being, you stupid idiot!

01:26:55.524 --> 01:26:57.992
- I didn't ever mean to hurt you. I--

01:26:58.059 --> 01:27:01.028
Oh, Edgar.

01:27:01.062 --> 01:27:03.826
- I've just been speaking
with Dr. Philips.
- Yes.

01:27:03.899 --> 01:27:08.836
Her explicit instructions are
that we, none of us,
leave the premises as of today.

01:27:08.904 --> 01:27:11.304
- How's she workin'?

01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:13.303
Good. Good, boss.

01:27:15.243 --> 01:27:17.211
Out this morning.

01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:21.740
- Cheech.
- What's up, Mr. V.?

01:27:21.816 --> 01:27:26.219
Uh, nothin'.
I just wanted to talk.

01:27:26.288 --> 01:27:28.256
- Yeah?
- I'm a little sad these days.

01:27:28.290 --> 01:27:31.123
- Sure. Yeah.
- You know how it is.

01:27:36.765 --> 01:27:39.893
Curtain's gone up already.
Poor kid.

01:27:41.102 --> 01:27:43.070
Would've been a star,
don't you think?

01:27:43.104 --> 01:27:47.040
Yeah. It's all right.
We'll take care of those Kustabeck guys.

01:27:47.108 --> 01:27:50.908
- I wonder if it really was
the Kustabecks.
- Well, who else?

01:27:50.979 --> 01:27:55.541
I don't know.
But we got some tips...

01:27:55.617 --> 01:27:58.347
- that Charlie K. had
nothin' to do with this.
- Really.

01:27:58.587 --> 01:28:01.351
Yeah. Don't make
no sense anyhow.

01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:05.651
I mean, the way things
were coolin' off and all.

01:28:05.727 --> 01:28:08.321
I'll see what I can find out
on the street, ya know?

01:28:08.563 --> 01:28:12.055
- Where you rushin' off to?
- Hey, you know, I told
the guys in the show...

01:28:12.133 --> 01:28:14.795
that l, uh, I'd stop by
and wish 'em good luck.

01:28:14.869 --> 01:28:17.702
- I got friendly with
some of the stage hands.
- Did you?

01:28:17.772 --> 01:28:19.831
- Yeah.
- That's unlike you.

01:28:19.908 --> 01:28:21.842
- Why's that?
- Unless they shoot crap.

01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:25.175
No, you know, you see
the same faces every day. You know.

01:28:27.182 --> 01:28:31.278
Marty Bannister said he saw you pick
up Olive the night she got it, Cheech.

01:28:31.353 --> 01:28:34.288
- Me?
- Didn't you tell me you didn't see her?

01:28:34.322 --> 01:28:36.290
Me? Yeah,
I said I did.

01:28:36.324 --> 01:28:41.091
I picked her up, and I dropped her off
a few blocks from the theater. Why?

01:28:41.162 --> 01:28:44.131
- You had nothin' against Olive, did ya?
- Olive? Naw.

01:28:44.199 --> 01:28:47.225
- I like Olive. Why?
- I mean, you got along well?

01:28:47.302 --> 01:28:49.600
Olive and l, we got along good.
You know, Olive.

01:28:49.671 --> 01:28:51.605
Olive was good for
a lot of laughs, right?

01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:53.835
- Except for a few tiffs here and there?
- Right.

01:28:53.908 --> 01:28:55.899
Olive's-- You know.
We got along.

01:28:57.712 --> 01:29:00.647
How come you didn't bring her
to me at the club, Cheech?

01:29:00.682 --> 01:29:04.641
She said you changed your mind, that
I should drop her off at the theater.

01:29:04.686 --> 01:29:08.315
- The theater. At night?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:29:08.356 --> 01:29:11.655
There was no preview
that night, Cheech. No rehearsal.

01:29:11.726 --> 01:29:13.990
Really?

01:29:14.062 --> 01:29:17.225
How come you
left her alone, Cheech?

01:29:17.298 --> 01:29:19.994
- And you didn't come
to the club and tell me?

01:29:20.068 --> 01:29:23.902
I'm gonna level with you, all right?
I had a crap game.
I didn't want to miss it.

01:29:23.972 --> 01:29:26.270
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

01:29:26.341 --> 01:29:29.742
- Why you don't tell me?
- You wanna lay off?
I'm up to here in debts.

01:29:29.811 --> 01:29:31.745
- I'm tryin' to get even.
- Yeah?

01:29:31.813 --> 01:29:34.976
Yeah. Dice ain't been too lucky for me.
You know. You know how it is.

01:29:35.016 --> 01:29:38.144
You keep tellin' me I gotta quit.
Ya know, I should.

01:29:38.219 --> 01:29:40.153
- Cheech--
- Listen, listen.

01:29:40.188 --> 01:29:43.419
I told the guys I'd wish them good luck
in the show. They're very superstitious.

01:29:43.658 --> 01:29:46.684
I'm gonna find out who hit her,
all right? I'll find out.

01:29:46.761 --> 01:29:48.854
All right.
I'll see ya later.

01:29:53.968 --> 01:29:56.960
He did it, Nick.
I don't know what his grudge was.

01:29:57.038 --> 01:29:59.700
Maybe they were
two-timin' ya.

01:29:59.741 --> 01:30:02.266
- What are you sayin' to me?
- Take it easy, Nick.

01:30:02.343 --> 01:30:05.471
It's only a guess.
But Marty Bannister saw them together...

01:30:05.714 --> 01:30:08.148
and that pier is
Cheech's favorite spot.

01:30:08.216 --> 01:30:11.049
Can't you see he was lyin', Nickie?
Did you see the look on his face?

01:30:11.119 --> 01:30:15.317
- He was scared.
- Look, Nick, I know you
don't like to think it...

01:30:15.390 --> 01:30:19.053
- but the gossip is, she
was runnin' around on ya.
- Don't say that!

01:30:19.094 --> 01:30:21.892
- I'm only tryin' to help, Mr. V.
- Nickie.

01:30:21.963 --> 01:30:23.897
He's only tryin'
to help.

01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:27.434
Cheech and Olive.

01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:30.929
Fix him.

01:30:31.005 --> 01:30:34.702
Oh, it's goin' great.

01:30:34.743 --> 01:30:38.941
Yeah, they're eating it up. Before,
I could smell money. Now I can taste it.

01:30:39.013 --> 01:30:41.413
- Mmm, yeah.
- Hey, what's the matter?

01:30:41.483 --> 01:30:44.884
You look as though you're watchin'
a turkey. It's just the opposite.

01:30:44.919 --> 01:30:48.355
- Where's Ellen?
- Oh, she was too nervous to come.

01:30:48.423 --> 01:30:51.221
 This is
Dr. Emilene Philips, a family friend.

01:30:51.259 --> 01:30:53.386
- Hey. How's it goin'?
- Cheech, how are ya?

01:30:53.461 --> 01:30:57.056
Goin' great. Wonderful.
You need to cheer him up. I don't know.

01:30:57.132 --> 01:30:59.100
- What's the matter?
- What do you want?

01:30:59.134 --> 01:31:02.228
- It's goin' great, huh?
- You killed Olive, Cheech.

01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:04.363
For that I can never
forgive you.

01:31:04.439 --> 01:31:07.203
I don't care what kind of
genius you are.

01:31:07.275 --> 01:31:11.041
Listen to that audience. Huh? They got
'em right in the palm of their hand.

01:31:11.112 --> 01:31:13.979
Hey, Cheech. It's over for you.
You're finished.

01:31:14.048 --> 01:31:15.982
 I had such
a wonderful time.

01:31:16.050 --> 01:31:20.350
 I can't live like this,
the same routine over and over.

01:31:20.421 --> 01:31:24.289
You think the same thing's not gonna
happen to you as happened to me?

01:31:24.325 --> 01:31:27.317
You think you're not gonna be here
sitting with a hole in your sweater...

01:31:27.395 --> 01:31:29.329
and a drink in your hand
someday?

01:31:29.397 --> 01:31:32.889
- Just wait!
- Cheech! You should be out front.

01:31:32.967 --> 01:31:36.061
You're about to miss my great scene.
Did you see the first part?

01:31:36.137 --> 01:31:41.074
- How did it go?
Do you think they like it?
-  Great, great.

01:31:41.142 --> 01:31:45.442
- Where's Cheech?
- Get the fuck outta here.
Get outta here.

01:31:45.513 --> 01:31:49.074
- Sucker.

01:31:51.486 --> 01:31:54.546
- You crapped out for
the last time, Cheech.
-  I think he's--

01:31:54.789 --> 01:31:57.917
I'm in the garden, Sylvia,
tending roses.

01:31:57.992 --> 01:32:01.120
 Oh, darling,
if we just had a baby.

01:32:01.196 --> 01:32:04.825
- That's all I think about.
-  We've been
through all this before.

01:32:04.899 --> 01:32:08.062
Cheech! Cheech.

01:32:08.136 --> 01:32:10.297
David.

01:32:10.338 --> 01:32:13.466
- The last line...
- Yes?

01:32:13.541 --> 01:32:15.509
in the play.

01:32:16.878 --> 01:32:20.143
Tell Sylvia Poston...

01:32:22.150 --> 01:32:24.812
to say she's pregnant.

01:32:26.454 --> 01:32:30.049
It'll be a great finish.

01:32:30.124 --> 01:32:33.287
- Oh, God, that's so great.
- No. Don't speak.

01:32:34.963 --> 01:32:36.897
Don't speak.

01:32:46.174 --> 01:32:50.042
"A masterpiece."
"A theatrical stunner."

01:32:52.347 --> 01:32:55.282
"A work of art
of the highest quality.

01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:58.649
One of the greatest moments of this
reviewer's experience was in Act Ill...

01:32:58.887 --> 01:33:01.481
when the Lieutenant returns
and confronts his mistress.

01:33:01.556 --> 01:33:04.218
We hear distant gunshots,
which get louder and louder...

01:33:04.292 --> 01:33:09.025
bringing the Lieutenant's twisted
military past and violent tendencies...

01:33:09.097 --> 01:33:11.156
into bold bas-relief.

01:33:11.232 --> 01:33:16.067
Writer-director David Shayne
is the find of the decade.

01:33:16.104 --> 01:33:19.562
- Where is David?
- I don't know. I assumed he'd be here.

01:33:35.290 --> 01:33:37.315
Flender!

01:33:37.392 --> 01:33:40.054
Flender, wake up.
It's David Shayne.

01:33:40.128 --> 01:33:42.426
I need
to talk to you.

01:33:42.463 --> 01:33:45.990
Please, Flender.
Flender!

01:33:46.067 --> 01:33:49.434
Ha-ha! Look who's here.
The big Broadway success.

01:33:49.470 --> 01:33:51.597
I don't write hits.
My plays are art.

01:33:51.673 --> 01:33:54.403
- They're written specifically
to go unproduced.
- Is Ellen there?

01:33:54.442 --> 01:33:56.501
- No, she's not here.
- I think she is.

01:33:56.577 --> 01:33:59.102
Congratulations
on your hit, David.

01:33:59.147 --> 01:34:02.241
- I always knew ya had it in you.
- Yeah, well, you were wrong.

01:34:02.283 --> 01:34:05.411
- I have to--
I have to ask you a question.
- What?

01:34:05.453 --> 01:34:08.115
Did you love me as the artist
or as the man?

01:34:08.189 --> 01:34:12.182
- Both.
- Well, what if it turned out
that I wasn't really an artist?

01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:15.127
I could love a man if
he's not a real artist...

01:34:15.196 --> 01:34:18.029
but I couldn't love an artist
if he's not a real man.

01:34:18.099 --> 01:34:21.262
Th-This is all academic.
She's with me now. You're with me now.

01:34:21.336 --> 01:34:24.032
- Do you really want to be with Flender?
- Yes.

01:34:24.105 --> 01:34:27.074
- Hey! Flender is a great lover.
- Ohh.

01:34:27.141 --> 01:34:31.510
- Hey, I slept with Flender.
He was just okay.
-  Really?

01:34:31.579 --> 01:34:34.241
 Rita, please!
What are you talking about?

01:34:34.315 --> 01:34:36.249
That was years ago, during
your free-love period.

01:34:36.317 --> 01:34:39.309
 I feel it's relational.
For me, he's great.

01:34:39.387 --> 01:34:42.618
Huh, interesting. Are you talking
pure mechanics or what?

01:34:42.690 --> 01:34:45.158
- His technique is prodigious.
- Prodigious?

01:34:45.193 --> 01:34:49.459
- You're confusing sex and love.
- No, for me, love is very deep.

01:34:49.530 --> 01:34:51.464
Sex only has to go
a few inches.

01:34:51.499 --> 01:34:56.459
Y-You're all missing the point.
The point is, I can give
pleasure many times a day.

01:34:56.537 --> 01:34:59.597
Oh, now really, Flender.
What has quantity got to do with it?

01:34:59.674 --> 01:35:02.472
- Quantity affects quality.
- Says who?

01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:05.377
- Karl Marx.
- Oh, so now
we're talking economics.

01:35:05.446 --> 01:35:09.075
- Sex is economics.
- Bullshit. Ellen, come down here.
I wanna talk to you.

01:35:09.150 --> 01:35:12.278
I love you. I wanna see you.
Come down here.

01:35:12.353 --> 01:35:15.322
- All right.
- What do you mean "All right"?
What about me?

01:35:15.390 --> 01:35:18.359
You're great, Flender, but it's no use.
I'll never get over David.

01:35:18.393 --> 01:35:22.159
Couldn't you tell? Each time
I climaxed, I'd scream, "David! David!"

01:35:22.196 --> 01:35:24.289
I thought you were saying,
"Do it! Do it!"

01:35:24.365 --> 01:35:27.266
Flender, stop it.
Leave 'em alone.

01:35:27.335 --> 01:35:29.667
Can't you see
they love each other?

01:35:34.375 --> 01:35:37.469
I'm finished with it:
living in the garrets...

01:35:37.545 --> 01:35:41.481
eating cheese and drinking wine
and analyzing art in coffee houses.

01:35:41.549 --> 01:35:44.074
It's over.
I love you.

01:35:44.152 --> 01:35:47.178
- I want us to get married.
We'll go back to Pittsburgh.
- But you're a success.

01:35:47.255 --> 01:35:50.053
- You have a hit. Why the sudden change?
- We'll have kids.

01:35:50.124 --> 01:35:53.491
- Because I've wasted too much
time already. I love you.
- But you're an artist.

01:35:53.561 --> 01:35:55.529
No, I'm not.
I'm not.

01:35:55.596 --> 01:35:58.588
I'll explain it all to you on
the train back to Pittsburgh.

01:35:58.633 --> 01:36:02.091
There's two things of which I'm certain.
One is that I love you.

01:36:03.438 --> 01:36:05.565
Two is that
I'm not an artist.

01:36:06.607 --> 01:36:09.041
There, I said it,
and I feel free.

01:36:09.110 --> 01:36:11.044
I'm not an artist.

01:36:17.418 --> 01:36:19.386
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.
