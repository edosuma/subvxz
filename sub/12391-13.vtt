RIGHT NOW.

00:03.330 --> 00:05.662
IF YOU'RE QUIET, YOU CAN HEAR
THE HORSES SLEEPING.

00:05.700 --> 00:07.133
I CANNOT.

00:07.170 --> 00:09.400
IT SOUNDS LIKE NOTHING
TO ME.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.067
DAD?

00:11.110 --> 00:12.577
WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING?

00:12.610 --> 00:14.407
OH, NOTHING, SHAWN.

00:14.440 --> 00:15.577
IT'S YOUR MOM'S
STUPID SOAP OPERA.

00:15.610 --> 00:17.373
SHE LEFI' IT ON.
I WASN'T WATCHING AT ALL.

00:17.410 --> 00:20.243
I WAS TAKING A NAP,
ACTUALLY.

00:20.280 --> 00:23.340
DO YOU SLEEP
WITH YOUR EYES WIDE OPEN?

00:23.390 --> 00:25.085
OKAY, SHAWN, YES,
MAYBE I WAS HALF WATCHING.

00:25.120 --> 00:26.656
NOT BECAUSE I LIKE IT,

00:26.690 --> 00:28.089
BUT BECAUSE IT'S EDUCATIONAL.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.156
PAY CLOSE ATTENTION,
YOU MIGHT LEARN

00:30.190 --> 00:31.726
A LITTLE SOMETHING TOO.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.524
I HAD A VASECTOMY
TWO YEARS AGO.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.767
THAT LOGAN IS PROBABLY
CHEATING ON SKYE?

00:36.800 --> 00:39.735
NO, SHAWN, I'M TALKING
ABOUT SHARPENING YOUR SKILLS.

00:39.770 --> 00:41.169
LOOK, WATCH HER CLOSELY.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.134
TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE.

00:44.570 --> 00:47.368
SHE'S. . . LOOKING
INTO THE LIGHT.

00:47.410 --> 00:48.638
BINGO.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.477
LOOKING DIRECTLY
INTO THE LIGHTS

00:50.510 --> 00:52.671
MAKES HER EYES TEAR UP,
SHE CRIES.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.109
SEEN PERPS DO IT
ALL THE TIME

00:55.150 --> 00:55.878
IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM.

00:55.920 --> 00:58.684
SO ACTING'S
REALLY JUST A LIE?

00:58.720 --> 00:59.652
OF COURSE, SHAWN.

00:59.690 --> 01:01.089
WHAT, YOU THINK
THOSE GOOFBALLS ON CHiPS

01:01.120 --> 01:02.826
ARE REALLY COPS?

01:02.860 --> 01:05.351
WOW, ANYTHING ELSE
YOU WANNA RUIN FOR ME?

01:10.300 --> 01:11.062
I DON'T THINK WE'RE ALLOWED

01:11.100 --> 01:12.590

OF THESE THINGS, SHAWN.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.460
IF THEY DIDN'T WANT US
TO DRIVE IT,

01:14.500 --> 01:15.694
WHY DID THEY LEAVE THE KEYS
UNDER THE SEAT?

01:15.740 --> 01:16.764
THIS IS NOT HOW I WANNA
BE SPENDING

01:16.810 --> 01:17.708
MY SATURDAY MORNING.

01:17.740 --> 01:19.731
DUDE, LASSIE CALLED, MAN.
HE CALLED US.

01:19.780 --> 01:20.804

01:20.840 --> 01:23.570
BESIDES, THIS IS A REAL,
LIVE TELEVISION STUDIO, GUS.

01:23.610 --> 01:24.577
WHAT COULD BE BETTER?

01:24.610 --> 01:25.577
EATING MY BREAKFAST.

01:25.610 --> 01:27.146
I WAS HAVING A POACHED EGG

01:27.180 --> 01:28.841
WITH HOLLANDAISE SAUCE
ON AN ENGLISH MUFFIN.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.745
LOOK, WE'LL SOLVE IT UP QUICK.

01:30.790 --> 01:31.745

01:33.720 --> 01:34.880

THE SOMETHING CALLED

01:37.330 --> 01:38.456
AND WANTS
ITS SOMETHING BACK BIT?

01:38.490 --> 01:40.321
LOOK AROUND, GUS.

DREAM ERS,

01:45.530 --> 01:46.861

01:46.900 --> 01:50.131
NOW, IF I WERE
A CRIME SCENE,

01:50.170 --> 01:51.205
WHERE WOULD I BE?

01:51.240 --> 01:54.129
HERE I AM.

01:54.180 --> 01:57.809
HEY, I KNOW THIS PLACE.
THIS IS CORRINE'S LIVING ROOM.

01:57.850 --> 01:59.579
WHO THE HELL IS CORRINE?

01:59.620 --> 02:00.541
IT'S THE LIVING ROOM

02:00.580 --> 02:02.411
FROM EXPLOSION GIGANTESCA
DE ROMANCE.

02:02.450 --> 02:03.644
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

02:03.690 --> 02:04.816
IT'S A SPANISH SOAP OPERA,
SHAWN.

02:04.850 --> 02:06.454
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
WHO ARE YOU?

02:06.490 --> 02:07.457
WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY BEST FRIEND?

02:07.490 --> 02:08.718
OH, MY GOSH!

02:08.760 --> 02:10.648
AND LASSITER IS TALKING
TO JORGE GAMA-LOBO.

02:10.690 --> 02:11.657
HE PLAYS VICENTE
ON THE SHOW.

02:11.690 --> 02:12.725
HE'S MY FAVORITE.

02:12.760 --> 02:13.749
HE SLEPT WITH MARIANA

02:13.800 --> 02:15.358
AT HIS OWN MOTHER'S FUNERAL,
SHAWN.

02:15.400 --> 02:16.560

02:26.640 --> 02:28.198
HE PLAYED ERNESTO
ON THE SHOW.

02:28.240 --> 02:28.899
HE USED TO BE MARRIED
TO CORRINE.

02:28.940 --> 02:29.838
I'M SORRY, DUDE.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.939
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU ACTUALLY
WATCH THIS SHOW.

02:31.980 --> 02:33.015
IT'S IN SPANISH.

02:33.050 --> 02:35.177
EVERYONE IN SANTA BARBARA
IS WATCHING IT, SHAWN.

02:35.220 --> 02:37.188

I WANT IN ON IT.

02:44.460 --> 02:46.257

HOW YOU DO IT.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.790
SPENCER,
THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

02:47.830 --> 02:49.229
NOW GO HOME.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.225

02:50.270 --> 02:51.089

02:51.130 --> 02:52.199
THIS THING'S PRETTY MUCH
OPEN AND SHUT.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.434
OH, JULES.

02:53.470 --> 02:54.562

MORE TIME WITH ME,

02:54.600 --> 02:55.897

GIVE ME A CALL,

02:56.940 --> 02:58.931

LISTEN TO ME, PLEASE!

03:12.420 --> 03:13.910
FOR THE LAST TIME,
I HAD NO IDEA

03:13.960 --> 03:15.609
THE COLLAPSIBLE PROP KNIFE
HAD BEEN REPLACED

03:15.660 --> 03:16.684
WITH THE REAL ONE.

03:18.690 --> 03:19.657

03:21.300 --> 03:22.267

03:22.300 --> 03:23.699

A LITTLE FORCED TO ME.

YOU STILL HERE?

03:30.040 --> 03:32.304
I TOLD YOU TO RUN ALONG.

03:34.310 --> 03:36.244

03:46.890 --> 03:48.448

03:48.490 --> 03:50.253
DO YOU HAVE SALAMI?

03:50.290 --> 03:51.427

03:51.460 --> 03:53.690
BUT AS PART OF ANOTHER SANDWICH
WITH OTHER ITALIAN MEATS.

03:53.730 --> 03:55.254
THAT'S INTERESTING.

03:55.300 --> 03:57.325

ONE CASE, AND YOU COULDN'T
GET US IN ON IT.

04:11.080 --> 04:13.048

YEAH, BUT LOOK THERE,

04:35.770 --> 04:36.907
HE DOESN'T LOOK ANGRY,
HE LOOKS FRIGHTENED.

04:36.940 --> 04:38.862
MORE IMPORTANTLY,
HE LOOKS SURPRISED.

04:38.910 --> 04:41.401
THAT IS NOT THE FACE
OF A PREMEDITATED KILLER.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.668
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

04:42.710 --> 04:44.041
I THINK IT MEANS
WE HAVE A CASE.

07:19.130 --> 07:20.666
BUT WE ONLY HAVE ONE DAY
TO EAT THEM.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.099
LET'S GET TO WORK, SHAWN.

07:22.140 --> 07:23.539
THAT'S LANCE ROTHSTEIN.
LET'S START WITH HIM.

07:23.570 --> 07:25.231
HE'S THE HEAD WRITER
ON THE SHOW.

07:25.270 --> 07:26.999
I SAW HIS PICTURE ONCE
IN SOAP DIARY MAGAZINE.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.029
HEAD WRITER, HUH?

07:28.080 --> 07:29.672
HE'S NOT EVEN SPANISH.

07:29.710 --> 07:30.972
NO, HE WAS A HOLLYWOOD GUY.

07:31.010 --> 07:32.648
USED TO WRITE ON BLOSSOM.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.511
DECIDED SPANISH SOAP OPERAS
WERE A BETTER REFLECTION

07:34.550 --> 07:35.744
OF THE HUMAN CONDITION.

07:35.780 --> 07:36.678
OBVIOUSLY HE DIDN'T
WRITE THE BLOSSOM

07:36.720 --> 07:38.711
WHERE SHE ADOPTED A CHIMP
AND HIT THE ROAD

07:38.750 --> 07:40.559
IN AN 18-WHEELER.

07:40.590 --> 07:41.682
THAT WAS BJ AND THE BEAR,
SHAWN.

07:41.720 --> 07:42.584
YOU TELL THEM
THAT LINE IS CUT.

07:42.630 --> 07:43.722
DON'T LISTEN TO THEM,
THEY'RE ACTORS.

07:43.760 --> 07:44.727
FLOYD ROTHSTEIN.

07:44.760 --> 07:46.057
LANCE.
LANCE ROTHSTEIN.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.728
YOU HAVE A MOMENT?
WE'RE BIG FANS.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.227
NO, I DON'T HAVE A MOMENT.
I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.796
YOU HAVE A HEADSHOT,
JUST DROP IT OFF

07:50.830 --> 07:52.764
IN THE CASTING DEPARTMENT
RIGHT OFF THE LOBBY.

07:52.800 --> 07:53.869
NO, SIR.
WE'RE NOT ACTORS.

07:53.900 --> 07:54.867
YOU'RE NOT?

07:54.900 --> 07:55.935
FURTHEST THING FROM IT.

07:55.970 --> 07:57.130
I'M A PSYCHIC.

07:57.170 --> 07:58.808
I DON'T REALLY--
NOT INTERESTED

07:58.840 --> 08:00.239
IN GETTING MY FORTUNE TOLD,
MR. UH...

08:00.280 --> 08:01.804
SPENCER.
SHAWN SPENCER.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.273
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
LAVENDER GOOMS.

08:03.310 --> 08:05.699
WE'RE HERE WITH THE POLICE
INVESTIGATING THE NUNEZ CASE.

08:05.750 --> 08:07.172
MR. ROTHSTEIN,
I'M BURTON GUSTER.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.710
WE WERE HERE YESTERDAY
AT THE CRIME SCENE,

08:08.750 --> 08:10.718
AND WE KNOW
THAT JORGE GAMA-LOBO

08:10.750 --> 08:12.012
WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE DEATH OF RINALDO NUNEZ.

08:12.050 --> 08:13.017
HE WASN'T?
NO.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.118
SHOCKING!

08:14.160 --> 08:15.252
I KNOW THAT.

08:15.290 --> 08:18.748
AND I DON'T WORK
WITH CRYSTAL BALLS.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.098
(Shawn)
MAKE A NOTE.

08:20.130 --> 08:21.597
I JUST LET THAT GO.

08:21.630 --> 08:23.928
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
WAY TOO EASY.

08:23.970 --> 08:26.939
YEAH, LOOK,
WHILE WE'RE TALKING HERE,

08:26.970 --> 08:28.835
A MURDERER IS WANDERING AROUND
LOOSE ON MY SET.

08:28.870 --> 08:30.599
WHICH IS NOT COMFORTING
FOR SOMEONE

08:30.640 --> 08:31.664
WITH MY WEAK CONSTITUTION.

08:31.710 --> 08:33.837
I ALREADY HAVE HEREDITARY ANGINA
AND SHIN SPLINTS.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.303
LISTEN, ARE YOU SURE
THAT YOU ARE NOT AN ACTOR?

08:36.340 --> 08:38.604
BECAUSE YOU REALLY DO HAVE
A CERTAIN LOOK.

08:38.650 --> 08:39.742
WHAT, A SHALLOW LOOK?

08:39.780 --> 08:40.917
NO, I HAVE TO GO.

08:40.950 --> 08:42.076
WHOA, WHOA, I STILL HAVE
SOME MORE QUESTIONS.

08:42.120 --> 08:44.611
LOOK, IF I DO NOT SHOOT
THIS SCENE...

08:44.650 --> 08:46.311
RIGHT NOW,
THEN LATER IN THE WEEK,

08:46.350 --> 08:47.817
WE'RE GONNA
BE DOING THIS SHOW LIVE.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.885
WHY DON'T YOU FIND ME
LATER ON THE SET, ALL RIGHT?

08:49.930 --> 08:52.251
OKAY, BUT WHAT WOULD
REALLY BE HELPFUL RIGHT NOW

08:52.290 --> 08:53.951
IS IF YOU JUST GAVE US
MR. GAMA-LOBO'S HOME ADDRESS

08:54.000 --> 08:55.126
SO THAT WE COULD GO THERE
AND INTERVIEW HIM.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.696
THAT IS NOT NECESSARY.

08:56.730 --> 08:57.697
THE MAN HAS BEEN
DOING THIS SHOW FOR EIGHT YEARS.

08:57.730 --> 09:01.734
HIS WIFE LEFT HIM.
THIS IS HIS HOME ADDRESS.

09:05.840 --> 09:08.070
I'M SENSING A HAIR
IN THE EVIDENCE BAGGIE.

09:08.110 --> 09:09.600
MAN, IT JUST IRKS ME!

09:09.650 --> 09:10.901
I STILL THINK
WE SHOULD BRING IN

09:10.950 --> 09:11.871
SOME OF THE OTHER CAST MEMBERS
FOR QUESTIONING.

09:11.910 --> 09:13.218
HERE'S THE THING, O'HARA.

09:13.250 --> 09:14.319
IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED.

09:14.350 --> 09:15.840
MOTIVATION, OPPORTUNITY,
EXECUTION.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.142
WITH NUNEZ OUT OF THE PICTURE,

09:17.190 --> 09:18.885
JORGE'S ROLE ON THE SHOW
GETS LARGER.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.012
M OTIVATIO N .

09:20.060 --> 09:21.948
KNOWING IN ADVANCE
THAT IT'S SCRIPTED

09:21.990 --> 09:23.958
THAT HE WOULD STAB NUNEZ
PRESENTS OPPORTUNITY.

09:23.990 --> 09:25.855
THE FACT THAT HE WAS
UNMISTAKABLY CAUGHT

09:25.890 --> 09:27.892
ON FILM
ACTUALLY STABBING THE VICTIM,

09:27.930 --> 09:29.090
HELLO, EXECUTION.

09:29.130 --> 09:30.825
SOON AS WE GET
THOSE LAB RESULTS BACK,

09:30.870 --> 09:31.928
WE'LL BE DONE--THANK YOU.

09:31.970 --> 09:33.232
WHO'S THAT?

09:33.270 --> 09:34.828
PASCORETTI, PENNY.
A NEWBIE.

09:34.870 --> 09:37.009
JUST TRANSFERRED IN
FROM THE 302 OUT OF OAKLAND.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.007
HUH, IT'S ABOUT TIME.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.132
WE COULD USE
SOME NEW BLOOD.

09:39.170 --> 09:39.932
I HATE NEW BLOOD.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.130
OF COURSE YOU DO.
I WELCOME IT.

09:42.180 --> 09:43.602
ESPECIALLY NEW FEMALE BLOOD.

09:43.650 --> 09:45.675
IT GETS LONELY HERE
IN THIS SEA OF TESTOSTERONE.

09:45.710 --> 09:46.677
WELL, YOU GO RIGHT AHEAD,
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

09:46.720 --> 09:47.948
MAKE A NEW FRIEND.

09:47.980 --> 09:49.072
MAYBE YOU COULD HAVE
A LITTLE TEA PARTY.

09:49.120 --> 09:50.644
BRAID EACH OTHER'S HAIR,
FOR ALL I CARE.

09:54.660 --> 09:55.957
HELLO, I'M DETECTIVE O'HARA,

09:55.990 --> 09:58.026
BUT YOU CAN CALL ME JULIET.

10:01.800 --> 10:02.994
ANYWAY, I JUST WANTED

10:03.030 --> 10:04.827
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF,
AND WELCOME YOU HERE,

10:04.870 --> 10:06.929
AND LET YOU KNOW IF YOU NEED
ANY HELP WITH ANYTHING,

10:06.970 --> 10:08.699
DON'T HESITATE TO ASK.

10:08.740 --> 10:09.638
DOES IT LOOK LIKE
I DON'T KNOW

10:09.670 --> 10:11.865
HOW TO WRITE MY OWN NAME
AND BADGE NUMBER?

10:18.210 --> 10:21.668
BFF'S?
BEST FRIENDS FOREVER?

10:21.720 --> 10:23.642
SHUT UP, LASSITER.

10:23.690 --> 10:25.214
(Shawn)
MR. GAMAâ€”LOBO...

10:25.250 --> 10:26.786
WE JUST HAVE
A FEW QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

10:26.820 --> 10:28.287
CALL ME JORGE, PLEASE.

10:28.320 --> 10:31.118
JORGE?

10:31.160 --> 10:32.627
COME ON,
THAT'S A LITTLE SILLY.

10:34.960 --> 10:35.995
THAT'S YOUR NAME.
THAT'S COOL.

10:36.030 --> 10:37.998
UH...

10:38.030 --> 10:39.019
WE KNOW
YOU DIDN'T DO IT.

10:39.070 --> 10:40.037
YOU DO?

10:40.070 --> 10:40.934
WE THINK YOU WERE FRAMED.

10:40.970 --> 10:42.835
OH!

10:42.870 --> 10:45.009
THIS IS MUSIC
TO MY EARLOBES.

10:45.040 --> 10:46.007
DO YOU HAVE QUESTIONS FOR ME?

10:46.040 --> 10:47.678
(Gus)
YES, WE DO.

10:47.710 --> 10:49.678
DO YOU KNOW
IF SERENA'S BABY IS YOURS?

10:49.710 --> 10:50.677
WHAT?

10:50.710 --> 10:51.677
SERENA'S BABY.

10:51.710 --> 10:54.019
GUS.
I'M SORRY.

10:54.050 --> 10:55.938
ARE THOSE MEATBALLS
FROM CRAFT SERVICE?

10:57.950 --> 10:59.679
YES, YES, KELLY KNOWS
THEY ARE MY FAVORITE.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.415
USUALLY I HUNGER
FOR HER MEATBALLS

11:01.460 --> 11:04.452
THE WAY A JACKAL SALIVATES
FOR AN INJURED POSSUM...

11:04.490 --> 11:06.458
BUT SADLY, I HAVE
NO APPETITE FOR THEM NOW.

11:06.490 --> 11:07.991
GRAB THE ONE THAT DOESN'T
HAVE A FORK IN IT.

11:08.030 --> 11:09.429
SHAWN.
THEY'RE STILL STEAMING.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.927
THE LITTLE--WHOA!

11:10.970 --> 11:12.392
WHO'S THIS OVER HERE?

11:12.430 --> 11:13.692
THAT IS MY FAMILY.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.890
YES, THEY ARE ALL
BACK IN MEXICO.

11:15.940 --> 11:17.168
I LEFT THEM
TO DO THE SHOW.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.030
YOUR BROTHER.

11:19.070 --> 11:20.276
IT'S MY SISTER.

11:20.310 --> 11:24.974
NO, HE MEANS
THIS PERSON RIGHT HERE.

11:25.010 --> 11:26.272
YES, YES.
IT'S MY SISTER.

11:26.310 --> 11:29.074
NO, HE MEANS THIS ONE.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.212
RIGHT HERE.

11:30.250 --> 11:31.285
WHERE MY FINGER IS.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.413
YES, YES.
IT'S MY SISTER.

11:34.860 --> 11:35.815
SHE IS QUITE LOVELY.

11:35.860 --> 11:37.885
IN A YOUNG...

11:37.930 --> 11:39.386
KEITH HERNANDEZ...

11:39.430 --> 11:40.988
SORT OF...

11:41.030 --> 11:42.964
YOU MUST MISS THEM
VERY MUCH.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.968
YES.

11:51.170 --> 11:53.968
OH!

11:54.010 --> 11:55.477
I SENSE VIOLENCE.

11:55.510 --> 11:56.943
AN ALTERCATION.

11:56.980 --> 11:58.868
HERE, IN THIS ROOM.

11:58.910 --> 12:00.411
SOMEONE HAD SOMETHING
AGAINST YOU.

12:00.450 --> 12:03.089
HERE!

12:03.120 --> 12:05.042
YES.
YES, QUINTESSA.

12:05.090 --> 12:06.318
(Gus)
QUINTESSA GABRIELLE.

12:06.350 --> 12:07.749
SHE PLAYS CORRINE
ON THE SHOW.

12:07.790 --> 12:09.087
SHE IS GORGEOUS.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.781
YOU DON'T KNOW HER WRATH.

12:10.830 --> 12:11.819
SHE HATES ME.

12:11.860 --> 12:13.851
SHE'S LIKE
THE LATINA SUSAN LUCCI.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.128
SHE BEAT ME UP.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.924
I HARDLY THINK THERE'S
A WOMAN CAPABLE OF THAT.

12:17.970 --> 12:19.096
BEA ARTHUR.

12:19.130 --> 12:20.062
I STAND CORRECTED.

12:20.100 --> 12:21.863
[breaking glass]

12:21.900 --> 12:23.868
(Lance)
QUINTESSA!

12:23.910 --> 12:25.161
'SCUSE US.

12:25.210 --> 12:26.165
WOULD YOU PLEASE
JUST COME OUT

12:26.210 --> 12:27.177
AND TALK TO ME?

12:27.210 --> 12:28.768
(Quintessa)
GO AWAY!

12:28.810 --> 12:30.277
I PROMISE YOU,
I SWEAR TO YOU,

12:30.310 --> 12:31.868
I WILL CHANGE THE LINE.

12:31.910 --> 12:33.468
I WAS MISINFORMED.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.818
THERE'S GOTTA BE
ANOTHER SPANISH WORD FOR NIPPLE.

12:35.850 --> 12:38.318
JUST TELL ME WHAT IT IS.

12:38.350 --> 12:40.853
[speaking Spanish]

12:43.030 --> 12:44.179
HI, HOW YOU DOING?

12:44.230 --> 12:46.050
I'M JUST GOING
TO THE WRITERS' ROOM

12:46.090 --> 12:48.092
WHERE IT'S EMOTIONALLY
DAMAGING,

12:48.130 --> 12:51.019
BUT IT'S PHYSICALLY SAFE.

12:56.270 --> 12:57.430
LET'S GO AFTER HER.

12:57.470 --> 12:59.108
WHOA, WHOA, MAYBE NOW
ISN'T THE BEST TIME

12:59.140 --> 13:00.107
TO APPROACH HER.

13:00.140 --> 13:00.970
YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:01.010 --> 13:02.329
WE ONLY HAVE A DAY
TO SOLVE THE CASE.

13:02.380 --> 13:04.109
WE SHOULD WAIT AND HANG OUT.

13:04.150 --> 13:05.879
I'LL DO THE HEAW LIFTING
AND CHARM HER,

13:05.910 --> 13:07.047
YOU GRAB A PIECE OF HER HAIR.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.377
GRAB A PIECE OF HER HAIR,
WHY?

13:08.420 --> 13:10.479
SO WE CAN COMPARE IT
TO THE ONE ON THE MURDER WEAPON.

13:10.520 --> 13:13.159
HOW AM I GONNA GRAB
A PIECE OF HER HAIR, SHAWN?

13:13.190 --> 13:14.054
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
I CAN TELL YOU.

13:14.090 --> 13:16.149
I TOLD THE POLICEMAN
EVERYTHING I KNOW.

13:16.190 --> 13:17.487
POLICEMAN?

13:17.530 --> 13:19.486
YES, THE TALL
SCURW-LIKE ONE

13:19.530 --> 13:20.497
WITH NO RHYTHM.

13:20.530 --> 13:21.497
DETECTIVE LASSITER?

13:21.530 --> 13:22.497
YES, THAT WAS HIS NAME.

13:22.530 --> 13:24.521
WERE YOU
AND RINALDO NUNEZ...

13:24.570 --> 13:25.389
CLOSE?

13:25.430 --> 13:27.534
WELL, WE WERE
WORKING TOGETHER, BUT...

13:27.570 --> 13:30.869
BUT NO, I DIDN'T KNOW HIM
VERY WELL AT ALL.

13:30.910 --> 13:31.865
I'M A PROFESSIONAL.

13:31.910 --> 13:33.138
I SEE.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.136
WAS HE EVER
IN YOUR DRESSING ROOM?

13:35.180 --> 13:36.431
I SHOULD SAY NOT!

13:36.480 --> 13:41.042
THAT'S STRANGE.

13:41.080 --> 13:41.978
I'M SEEING HIM
IN YOUR DRESSING ROOM.

13:42.020 --> 13:45.046
ARE YOU A PSYCHIC
OR SOME KIND OF WITCH?

13:45.090 --> 13:49.015
OKAY...

13:49.060 --> 13:52.484
SO MAYBE SOMETIMES
HE CAME TO MY DRESSING ROOM

13:52.530 --> 13:54.054
TO REHEARSE LINES
OR SOMETHING.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.159
NO, HE'S NOT RUNNING LINES.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.929
HE'S HOLDING A FEATHER DUSTER,

13:57.970 --> 13:59.221
DIPPING HIMSELF
IN PANCAKE BATTER.

13:59.270 --> 14:00.897
AND HE'S QUITE NAKED.

14:00.940 --> 14:04.205
[speaking Spanish]

14:04.240 --> 14:08.074
OKAY, SO SHE'S
DEFINITELY BOINKING NUNEZ.

14:08.110 --> 14:09.077
DOES THAT MAKE HER
A SUSPECT?

14:09.110 --> 14:10.941
WELL, SHE DID LIE ABOUT IT.

14:10.980 --> 14:12.379
WHY?

14:12.410 --> 14:13.445
WELL, HE DOES
WEAR BIKINI BRIEFS.

14:13.480 --> 14:16.415
HMM.

14:16.450 --> 14:17.417
SWEET.

14:17.450 --> 14:20.089
DUDE.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.109
THIS ISN'T A HAIR.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.513
WHAT?

14:22.560 --> 14:24.084
IT'S JUST
PART OF HER SCRUNCHIE.

14:24.130 --> 14:25.154
LOOK!

14:25.190 --> 14:26.259
IT'S ALL ELASTIC-Y.

14:26.290 --> 14:27.598
IT'S GOT A PIECE
OF BEDAZZLE IN IT.

14:27.630 --> 14:28.619
IT'S MADE OUT OF YARN.

14:28.660 --> 14:29.968
GOOD WORK, BUDDY.

14:30.000 --> 14:30.967
FORGET IT,
I'LL FIGURE OUT

14:31.000 --> 14:32.262
HOW TO PLUCK ONE MYSELF.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.131
I THINK
WE SHOULD SPLIT UP.

14:34.170 --> 14:35.137
YOU HIT THE PROPS DEPARTMENT,

14:35.170 --> 14:36.068
SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND OUT
ABOUT OUR WEAPON.

14:36.100 --> 14:38.466
I'M GONNA POP IN
TO THE STAGE AND GRILL LANCE

14:38.510 --> 14:40.603
ABOUT THE QUINTESSA/JORGE
RELATIONSHIP.

14:40.640 --> 14:42.278
[giggling]

14:42.310 --> 14:43.470
JORGE.

14:46.110 --> 14:49.113
[speaking Spanish]

14:54.560 --> 14:56.983
CAMERA TWO, PUSH IN.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.918
HOLD IT THERE.
[doorbell]

14:58.960 --> 15:00.120
GO.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.253
SO THIS IS WHERE
ALL THE MAGIC HAPPENS, HUH?

15:02.300 --> 15:04.063
YES, SMELL THE DREAM.

15:04.100 --> 15:06.227
[inhales]

15:06.270 --> 15:07.237
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

15:07.270 --> 15:08.692
I THINK...
SHH, SHH.

15:08.740 --> 15:12.164
I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST GONNA WATCH.

15:12.210 --> 15:15.236
[speaking Spanish]

15:20.550 --> 15:21.676
WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING?

15:21.720 --> 15:23.085
WHAT, DOES HE GOT
A TWITCH OR SOMETHING?

15:23.120 --> 15:26.009
I'M AFRAID
THAT'S CALLED HIS ACTING.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.517
HE'S ONLY
GOT A COUPLE OF LINES.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.050
(Director)
IT'S ALWAYS
THE BIT PLAYERS.

15:29.090 --> 15:30.318
(Shawn)
IS HE FLIRTING WITH HER?

15:30.360 --> 15:31.987
THAT WAS THE IDEA.

15:32.030 --> 15:34.089
HE SHOULD BE MORE SUBTLE
THAN THAT, MAN.

15:34.130 --> 15:36.325
LIKE, YOU DON'T SEDUCE
A WOMAN WITH YOUR FOREHEAD

15:36.360 --> 15:38.123
AND YOUR ADAM'S APPLE.

15:38.170 --> 15:40.229
IT'S RIGHT HERE.
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN HERE.

15:40.270 --> 15:42.158
IT DOESN'T START THERE,
YOU KNOW?

15:42.200 --> 15:43.667
I MEAN, YOU'RE OVER HERE
AND THEN...

15:43.710 --> 15:45.302
HOW WOULD YOU DO THE LINE?

15:45.340 --> 15:47.399
DO...
DO WHAT?

15:47.440 --> 15:48.998
YOU KNOW.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.349
NO, I CAN'T--WHOA,
I JUST...

15:51.380 --> 15:54.042
WELL, THAT'S THE THING.

15:54.080 --> 15:55.217
JORGE WOULD NEVER
HAVE KNOWN

15:55.250 --> 15:56.740
THAT THE KNIFE WAS REAL.

15:56.780 --> 15:58.543
THE BLADES ARE VIRTUALLY
IDENTICAL, ACTUALLY.

15:58.590 --> 16:01.013
WE BUILD THE PROP
AS CLOSE TO THE SPECS

16:01.060 --> 16:02.357
OF YOUR AVERAGE
SIX-INCH BLADE AS WE CAN.

16:02.390 --> 16:03.379
MM-HMM.

16:03.430 --> 16:04.385
I MEAN, WE DO THAT,
OBVIOUSLY,

16:04.430 --> 16:05.351
FOR THE LOOK OF THE KNIFE.

16:05.390 --> 16:06.550
BUT ALSO, IT GIVES,
LIKE, A REALISTIC FEEL

16:06.590 --> 16:07.625
FOR THE ACTOR.

16:07.660 --> 16:08.627
YOU KNOW, THE SIZE,
THE WEIGHT.

16:08.660 --> 16:10.298
THE TEXTURE, SO ON.

16:10.330 --> 16:11.297
HERE, YOU WANNA HOLD IT?

16:11.330 --> 16:13.696
GO ON, HOLD IT.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.037
HUH, IT FEELS REAL.

16:15.070 --> 16:17.300
BUT IT'S NOT.
THAT'S THE FAKE ONE.

16:17.340 --> 16:19.001
SEE?
THE BLADE RETRACT S.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.234
COLLAPSES
RIGHT INTO THE HANDLE.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.235
AH!

16:21.280 --> 16:23.077
HEY, YOU WANNA TRY IT?

16:23.110 --> 16:24.577
OH, NO, I COULDN'T.
COME ON, STAB ME.

16:24.610 --> 16:26.248
NO, REALLY, I SHOULDN'T.
COME ON!

16:26.280 --> 16:28.339
GO AHEAD.
HEY, IT'S FUN, TRUST ME.

16:28.380 --> 16:30.416
ALL RIGHT.

16:30.450 --> 16:31.712
AH!

16:31.750 --> 16:34.583
JUST MESSING WITH YOU.

16:34.620 --> 16:36.713
UM, DO YOU MIND
IF I BORROW THIS

16:36.760 --> 16:38.557
TO SHOW MY PARTNER?

16:38.590 --> 16:39.625
IT'S FOR THE INVESTIGATION.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.500
OKAY, SHAWN, THIS IS WHAT
I FOUND OUT SO FAR.

16:50.540 --> 16:53.031
TURNS OUT THE KNIFE
MAY HAVE CHANGED HANDS

16:53.080 --> 16:55.139
UP TO SIX TIMES BEFORE NUNEZ
WAS STABBED WITH IT.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.148
THE DAY IS ALMOST UP
AND WE'VE GOTTEN NOWHERE.

16:57.180 --> 16:58.272
IT COULD BE ANYONE
ON THIS SET.

16:58.310 --> 17:00.141
WE NEED MORE ACCESS
AND MORE TIME.

17:00.180 --> 17:01.340
I THINK I'VE FIGURED OUT
A PRETTY GOOD ANGLE

17:01.380 --> 17:02.312
FOR THAT, BUDDY.

17:02.350 --> 17:04.147
I JUST NEED YOU TO STEP ASIDE
FOR ONE SECOND.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.249
MAYBE HIT
THE CRAFT SERVICE TABLE.

17:06.290 --> 17:08.315
GRAB US A COUPLE
OF THOSE POTATO LATKES.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.487
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
HOW KELLY MAKES THEM SO CRISPY.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.259
I'M NOT STEPPING ANWVHERE,
SHAWN.

17:12.290 --> 17:14.292
AM I THE ONLY ONE DOING
ANY WORK HERE ON THIS CASE?

17:14.330 --> 17:16.491
I'D LOVE TO GO TO WORK.
I'M READY, I FEEL IT.

17:16.530 --> 17:17.519
I JUST--I CAN'T.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.367
REALLY?
AND WHY IS THAT?

17:19.400 --> 17:21.231
YOU'RE STANDING
RIGHT IN MY EYE LINE, BUDDY.

17:21.270 --> 17:22.294
WHAT?

17:26.770 --> 17:29.102
(director)
QUIET ON THE SET!

17:29.140 --> 17:32.143
FOUR, THREE, TWO...

17:32.180 --> 17:34.171
AND ACTION.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.358
THANKS FOR COMING IN
TO SPEAK WITH US, MS. DESMONDO.

17:40.390 --> 17:41.789
YOU'RE WELCOME.

17:41.820 --> 17:43.856
I'M GONNA GET RIGHT TO IT.

17:43.890 --> 17:45.755
CAN YOU RECALL ANY INSTANCES
IN WHICH YOU WITNESSED

17:45.790 --> 17:48.452
JORGE GAMA-LOBO ENGAGING
IN VIOLENT BEHAVIOR?

17:48.500 --> 17:49.455
YES.

17:49.500 --> 17:50.592
YES?

17:50.630 --> 17:51.665
YES.

17:51.700 --> 17:52.792
PLEASE TELL US.

17:52.830 --> 17:54.036
IT WAS SEVEN YEARS AGO,

17:54.070 --> 17:57.233
WHEN HE PUSHED DIEGO CABRERA
OFF A BRIDGE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT.

17:57.270 --> 17:58.567
WAIT, THAT HAPPENED
IN THIS STATE?

17:58.610 --> 17:59.565
WHEN WAS HE CHARGED?

17:59.610 --> 18:00.577
HE WASN'T.

18:00.610 --> 18:01.804
HE BEAT THE RAP.

18:01.840 --> 18:03.171
BUT THERE WAS
AN EYEWITNESS.

18:03.210 --> 18:05.144
HIS THOUGHT-TO-BE-MISSING
STEPBROTH ER,

18:05.180 --> 18:05.942
JUAN SAN DOVAL.

18:05.980 --> 18:07.379
SAN DOVAL,
THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.876
MCNAB!

18:08.920 --> 18:11.411
GET IN HERE!

18:13.360 --> 18:14.509
I NEED YOU TO RUN
ALL INFORMATION

18:14.560 --> 18:15.709
ON A JUAN SANDOVAL.

18:15.760 --> 18:17.887
JUAN SAN DOVAL?

18:17.930 --> 18:20.490
WASN'T HE
YOUR COMMON LAW HUSBAND?

18:20.530 --> 18:21.554
WAIT. . .

18:21.600 --> 18:22.555
HE WAS YOUR HUSBAND?

18:22.600 --> 18:24.329
COMMON LAW.

18:24.370 --> 18:25.564
BUT YOU MURDERED HIM
BY FREEZING HIS BODY

18:25.600 --> 18:26.692
AND THEN
SHIPPING IT TO HAWAII,

18:26.730 --> 18:28.493
AND DEFROSTING IT
BY A VOLCANO.

18:28.540 --> 18:29.359
(Anita)
EXACTLY.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.459
THAT WAS FIFTH SEASON,
EPISODE ELEVEN.

18:31.510 --> 18:32.602
I'M A FAN.

18:32.640 --> 18:34.130
ARE YOU TWO TALKING

18:34.180 --> 18:35.431
ABOUT THE SHOW?

18:35.480 --> 18:36.833
I'M TALKING
ABOUT A REAL MURDER.

18:36.880 --> 18:37.699
I ACTUALLY
SAW THAT EPISODE.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.900
BUT HE CAME BACK
IN SEASON SIX, RIGHT?

18:39.950 --> 18:41.838
AS THE CHIEF SURGEON,
SO THAT HE COULD

18:41.880 --> 18:42.778
CHANGE VELMA'S FACE

18:42.820 --> 18:43.582
TO LOOK LIKE YOUR FACE
SO THAT YOU COULD

18:43.620 --> 18:45.838
TAKE THE RAP
FOR BEATRICE'S MURDER!

18:48.920 --> 18:51.889
IT'S THE ONLY EPISODE I SAW.

18:51.930 --> 18:53.329
WHO WRITES THIS CRAP?

18:53.360 --> 18:55.828
THE WRITERS ARE ALL SO COLORFUL
AND BRILLIANT.

18:55.860 --> 18:58.294
THEY'RE WONDERFUL
WITH THE BRUTAL CRIMES.

18:58.330 --> 19:00.298
THEY ARE SOME KIND
OF GENIUSES, I SWEAR.

19:00.340 --> 19:03.229
SOME KIND
OF MURDER GENIUSES MAYBE.

19:07.310 --> 19:09.778
[speaking Spanish]

19:25.490 --> 19:27.492
HE'S REALLY GOT SOMETHING,
AM I RIGHT?

19:27.530 --> 19:28.690
YES, HE'S MY MUSE.

19:29.860 --> 19:30.827
AH!

19:30.870 --> 19:32.792
CUT.

19:32.830 --> 19:34.764
EASY!

19:34.800 --> 19:36.939
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
YOU HIRE PEOPLE OFF THE STREET.

19:37.970 --> 19:39.665
SHE'S SWEET.

19:39.710 --> 19:42.304
SWEET LIKE MARIAH CAREY
ON A BENDER.

19:42.340 --> 19:42.999
HOW'D THAT LOOK?
OKAY.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.598
DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY,

19:44.650 --> 19:46.242
BUT I THINK IT LACKED
SOME PASSION.

19:46.280 --> 19:47.611
PASSION.
YES.

19:47.650 --> 19:48.969
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MANY PAGES WE SHOT TODAY?

19:49.020 --> 19:50.840
83.

19:50.890 --> 19:51.709
AND I'M GETTING BY
WITH THE SPANISH

19:51.750 --> 19:52.944
I LEARNED FROM CHARO
ON LOVE BOAT.

19:52.990 --> 19:54.309
PLUS I GOTTA
MAKE IT LOOK PASSIONATE?

19:54.360 --> 19:56.715
AND LOOK FOR CLUES?

19:56.760 --> 19:57.988
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.952
I'M PULLING IT OFF
QUITE NICELY.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.753
I GOT A HAIR
OFF QUINTESSA'S HEAD.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.893
BECAUSE OUR DRESSING ROOMS,
SIDE BY SIDE.

20:03.930 --> 20:04.828
NICE.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.292
HOW MANY TIMES
DO YOU TWO NEED TO BE TOLD

20:06.330 --> 20:07.695
YOU ARE NOT NEEDED
ON THIS CASE?

20:07.740 --> 20:09.765
YOU ARE WASTING
THE DEPARTMENT'S RESOURCES.

20:12.310 --> 20:13.834
HEY, PAL!

20:13.880 --> 20:15.632
PLEASE ESCORT THESE TWO
OFF THE PREMISES.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.898
WELL, UH...

20:17.950 --> 20:18.848
UH IS NOT AN ACTION WORD.

20:18.880 --> 20:22.316
NOW DROP THE JOE
AND TAKE THEM OUT OF HERE.

20:22.350 --> 20:23.942
WELL, ACTUALLY, THIS COFFEE'S
FOR MR. SPENCER.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.810
THANK YOU, ROGER.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.010
MR. SPENCER?

20:27.050 --> 20:29.450
WELL, UH, CHAD, I GUESS.

20:29.490 --> 20:30.650
WHAT?

20:30.690 --> 20:32.521
HERE, THESE PINEAPPLE
PEKING DUMPLINGS

20:32.560 --> 20:34.357
ARE SPECIAL FOR YOU, CHAD.

20:34.400 --> 20:38.496
THANK YOU, KELLY,
YOU SWEET LITTLE THING.

20:39.500 --> 20:40.967
NO.

20:42.940 --> 20:45.408
NO, NO, NO, NO.

20:45.440 --> 20:47.032
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO LEAVE THE STAGE AREA.

20:47.070 --> 20:48.901
WE'RE ABOUT TO ROLL.

20:48.940 --> 20:50.032
YOU DON'T
WANNA TOUCH ME.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.047
ROGER, IT'S OKAY.

20:51.080 --> 20:53.719
BEFORE YOU GO...

20:53.750 --> 20:55.342
YOU MIGHT WANT TO SEND THIS
DOWN TO YOUR BOYS

20:55.380 --> 20:56.677
AT THE LAB.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.415
IT'S A HAIR OFF
QUINTESSA GABRIELLE'S HEAD.

20:58.450 --> 21:00.611
THE SAME COLOR AND LENGTH
AS THE ONE

21:00.660 --> 21:02.309
FOUND ON THE MURDER WEAPON.

21:02.360 --> 21:05.659
I THINK YOU'LL FIND
IT'S A SWEET, SWEET MATCH.

21:05.690 --> 21:09.296
OH, YES.
I'LL GET RIGHT ON THAT.

21:09.330 --> 21:10.922
WHOOPS.
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

21:10.970 --> 21:12.369
THE HAIR FROM THE KNIFE
WAS SYNTHETIC.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.162
IT CAME FROM A WIG.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.963
QUINTESSA GABRIELLE'S HAIR
IS REAL.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.729
SO THERE'S NO MATCH.

21:16.770 --> 21:18.863
BUT NICE WORK.

21:18.910 --> 21:19.934
CHAD.

21:23.810 --> 21:25.346
WHAT KIND OF SHOW
DO YOU THINK WE'RE DOING?

21:25.380 --> 21:26.176
GOTTA KEEP IT GROUNDED,
YOU GOTTA KEEP IT REAL.

21:26.210 --> 21:27.313
WANNA GO BACK
TO BEING AN INTERN?

21:27.350 --> 21:28.419
LANCE ROTHSTEIN!

21:28.450 --> 21:29.917
EXCUSE ME,
I AM DOING SOMETHING HERE.

21:29.950 --> 21:30.780
NOT NOTHING.

21:30.820 --> 21:32.082
SHE'S ALREADY MAKING LOVE
TO HER NEPHEW.

21:32.120 --> 21:34.350
SHE CAN'T ALSO BE A NUN.

21:34.390 --> 21:36.312
YES, CAN I HELP YOU?
VERY QUICKLY.

21:36.360 --> 21:37.918
I HAVE A WARRANT
TO SEARCH THESE PREMISES,

21:37.960 --> 21:39.587
CONFISCATE ALL SCRIPTS
AND WRITTEN MATERIAL.

21:39.630 --> 21:40.722
ON WHAT GROUNDS?

21:40.760 --> 21:42.421
ON THE GROUNDS
YOU'VE ALL BEEN

21:42.460 --> 21:43.859
VERY BUSY THINKING UP
INGENIOUS WAYS

21:43.900 --> 21:45.026
TO KILL PEOPLE.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.330
(male newscaster)
ALL THAT, PLUS THE LATEST

21:52.370 --> 21:54.338
IN LOCAL SPORTS
WITH DAN THE MAN,

21:54.380 --> 21:55.608
COMING UP
AT 11:00 P.M.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.779
[doorbell ringing on TV]

21:57.810 --> 22:01.371
[speaking Spanish]

22:07.090 --> 22:09.854
WHAT THE HELL?

22:19.070 --> 22:20.958
WAIT, JORGE GAMA-LOBO
TRIED TO KILL HIMSELF?

22:21.000 --> 22:22.399
TRIED AND FAILED.

22:22.440 --> 22:23.407
MUST HAVE BEEN
SO WRACKED WITH GUILT

22:23.440 --> 22:25.101
OVER STABBING NUNEZ,
HE DECIDED TO OFF HIMSELF.

22:25.140 --> 22:26.505
DID HE LEAVE A NOTE?
OH, YEAH.

22:26.540 --> 22:27.700
ADMITTING TO THE MURDER.

22:27.740 --> 22:29.071
IT'S ALREADY WITH THE BOYS
DOWN AT THE LAB.

22:29.110 --> 22:32.477
I JUST WANTED TO GET IN THERE,
GET A VERBAL CONFESSION.

22:33.450 --> 22:35.611
YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

22:35.650 --> 22:37.811
STEP AWAY
FROM THE BED NOW!

22:37.850 --> 22:39.112
SHH!

22:39.150 --> 22:40.458
DON'T YOU SHUSH ME!

22:40.490 --> 22:42.082
I WAS ABOUT TO SAY
THERE'S STILL TIME

22:42.120 --> 22:43.724
FOR YOU TO GO DOWNSTAIRS
TO THE GIFT SHOP

22:43.760 --> 22:45.057
AND BUY SOMETHING.

22:45.090 --> 22:46.387
MAYBE A TEDDY BEAR.

22:46.430 --> 22:47.624
OH, THAT'S NICE.

22:47.660 --> 22:49.150
TEDDY BEARS ARE CUTE.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.724
THEY HAVE ONE
WITH A JAR OF HONEY

22:50.770 --> 22:52.567
THAT SAYS, "BEE WELL."

22:52.600 --> 22:54.488
I MEAN IT,
THIS TIME I WILL ARREST YOU

22:54.540 --> 22:55.893
FOR INTERFERING
IN POLICE BUSINESS.

22:55.940 --> 22:56.964
I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK
YOU TWO TO LEAVE.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.035
THIS MAN IS VERY SICK,

22:58.070 --> 22:59.469
AND I NEED QUIET IN HERE.

22:59.510 --> 23:00.579
US?

23:00.610 --> 23:01.702
EXCUSE ME,
I'M DETECTIVE O'HARA

23:01.740 --> 23:02.877
AND THIS
IS DETECTIVE LASSITER.

23:02.910 --> 23:04.400
AND WE'RE INVESTIGATING
THIS MAN.

23:04.450 --> 23:07.078
AND I DEMAND YOU REMOVE
THESE MEN FROM THIS ROOM.

23:07.110 --> 23:08.611
HONEY, THE ONLY PEOPLE
ACTUALLY AUTHORIZED

23:08.650 --> 23:12.188
TO BE IN HERE ARE
MR. SPENCER AND MR. GUSTER.

23:12.220 --> 23:13.949
THEY'RE ON MR. GAMA-LOBO'S
FRIENDS AND FAMILY LIST.

23:13.990 --> 23:15.150
EVERYONE ELSE...

23:15.190 --> 23:16.612
OUT.

23:16.660 --> 23:18.059
YOU JUST MET HIM
A WEEK AGO.

23:18.090 --> 23:20.627
HIS WHOLE FAMILY
IS BACK IN MEXICO.

23:20.660 --> 23:22.525
HIS OLDER BROTHER
MISSES HIM VERY MUCH.

23:22.560 --> 23:23.527
HIS SISTER.

23:23.570 --> 23:24.525
RIGHT.

23:24.570 --> 23:27.164
HOW DOES HE MAKE FRIENDS
SO FAST?

23:29.240 --> 23:30.605
I GET THAT JORGE
WAS DEPRESSED

23:30.640 --> 23:32.107
ABOUT BEING OFF THE SHOW,

23:32.140 --> 23:34.472
BUT MURDER/SUICIDE/COMA?

23:34.510 --> 23:35.477
THIS WHOLE THING
IS STARTING TO FEEL

23:35.510 --> 23:38.445
LIKE A REAL SOAP OPERA
TO ME.

23:38.480 --> 23:39.970
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE WOULD
TAKE HIS OWN LIFE.

23:44.050 --> 23:46.985
UNLESS HE WAS
WEARING A WIG...

23:47.020 --> 23:48.180
HE DIDN'T.

23:48.220 --> 23:52.486
SOMEONE ELSE DID.

23:55.730 --> 23:57.664
WHAT?

23:57.700 --> 23:58.667
I DON'T GET IT.

23:58.700 --> 24:01.237
REALLY?

24:01.270 --> 24:03.704
I THOUGHT I WRAPPED IT UP
SO NICELY FOR YOU JUST NOW.

24:03.740 --> 24:05.037
IT FELT REALLY GOOD.

24:05.070 --> 24:06.207
IT WAS ORGANIC.

24:06.240 --> 24:09.175
[clears throat]

24:10.510 --> 24:13.843
SYNTHETIC HAIR.

24:13.880 --> 24:17.441
JUST LIKE THE ONE
FOUND ON THE KNIFE.

24:19.290 --> 24:20.917
SO?

24:20.960 --> 24:23.258
DUDE.

24:23.290 --> 24:25.520
IT MEANS THE SAME PERSON
WAS THERE...

24:25.560 --> 24:29.690
WHEN JORGE
TRIED "TO KILL HIMSELF."

24:29.730 --> 24:30.799
HE WASN'T ALONE.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.062
SO WAIT...

24:36.100 --> 24:37.567
YOU'RE SAYING HE DIDN'T
TRY TO KILL HIMSELF?

24:37.610 --> 24:38.599
I CAN'T DO THIS.

24:38.640 --> 24:41.074
YOU'RE NOT BEING CLEAR,
SHAWN.

24:41.110 --> 24:43.578
(Shawn)
COME ON, DUDE.

24:43.610 --> 24:45.100
I GAVE IT TO YOU
THREE DIFFERENT WAYS.

24:45.150 --> 24:48.074
(Gus)
DID HE OR DID HE NOT
TRY TO KILL HIMSELF?

24:53.620 --> 24:55.110
IS THAT THE GAMA-LOBO
SUICIDE NOTE?

24:55.160 --> 24:56.115
YES, BUT I'M STILL WAITING
ON THE HANDWRITING SAMPLES

24:56.160 --> 24:57.559
FROM THE LAB.

24:57.590 --> 24:59.649
NAH, FORGET THAT.
JUST READ IT TO ME.

24:59.690 --> 25:02.693
OKAY, "DEAR WORLD,
I ASK FOR FORGIVENESS

25:02.730 --> 25:04.698
"FOR THE SINS I HAVE COMMITTED
AGAINST HUMANITY.

25:04.730 --> 25:06.664
"IT WAS MY HANDS...

25:06.700 --> 25:08.292
THAT CARRIED OUT
A HEINOUS MURDER."

25:08.340 --> 25:10.968
WAIT A MINUTE.
HOLD ON A SECOND.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.205
I KNOW THAT.

25:13.240 --> 25:14.571
YOU KNOW THAT?

25:14.610 --> 25:16.100
I HAVE BEEN LITERALLY
PORING OVER

25:16.140 --> 25:18.643
THESE THINGS FOR DAYS.

25:18.680 --> 25:19.806
HOLD ON A SECOND.

25:23.180 --> 25:24.909
OKAY, CONTINUE.

25:24.950 --> 25:29.216
"HOW CAN I GO BACK
AND REVERSE TIME?

25:29.260 --> 25:30.727
(both)
"I HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO SAY GOOD-BYE

25:30.760 --> 25:32.557
"TO A WORLD
I TURNED MY BACK ON

25:32.590 --> 25:35.058
AND THE WOMAN I BETRAYED.â€˜l

25:35.100 --> 25:37.796
WOW, IT'S FROM A SCRIPT?

25:37.830 --> 25:39.229
WORD FOR WORD.

25:39.270 --> 25:41.738
WRITTEN BY LANCE ROTHSTEIN.

25:41.770 --> 25:42.930
SO LANCE SET HIM UP.

25:42.970 --> 25:44.039
MM-HMM.

25:44.070 --> 25:45.708
WHAT, DID HE JUST
GET LAZY?

25:45.740 --> 25:46.434
DID HE THINK NO ONE
WOULD REMEMBER?

25:46.470 --> 25:48.199
HE'S GONNA HAVE
PLENTY OF TIME

25:48.240 --> 25:49.901
TO FIGURE OUT NEW PLOTLINES
BEHIND BARS.

25:53.620 --> 25:56.578
SO THIS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
TO BE IN JAIL.

25:56.620 --> 25:58.747
I ALWAYS WONDERED
IF I'D SURVIVE.

25:58.790 --> 25:59.688
I WAS IN JAIL ONCE.

25:59.720 --> 26:01.950
REALLY--THIS IS WHAT
IT WAS LIKE FOR YOU TOO?

26:03.790 --> 26:06.122
YEAH.
YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

26:06.160 --> 26:08.628
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
THESE PHONES AREN'T REAL.

26:08.660 --> 26:09.627
NO, COURSE NOT.

26:09.660 --> 26:10.627
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
IT WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.365
BUT I MEAN FOR ERNESTO'S
PRISON SCENE TOMORROW,

26:12.400 --> 26:13.367
IT'S GREAT, RIGHT?

26:13.400 --> 26:14.662
OH, YEAH.
YEAH.

26:14.700 --> 26:17.089
LANCE ROTHSTEIN,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

26:17.140 --> 26:18.107
FOR WHAT?

26:18.140 --> 26:20.779
THE MURDER
OF RINALDO NUNEZ.

26:20.810 --> 26:23.301
DON'T WORRY, I CAN
GET YOU OFF ON THAT ONE.

26:23.340 --> 26:26.741
AND THE ATTEMPTED MURDER
OF JORGE GAMA-LOBO.

26:26.780 --> 26:29.340
OOH, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT ONE.

26:40.760 --> 26:42.694
DON'T GET UP.
I'M NOT STAYING.

26:44.700 --> 26:45.667
I WAS WORKING ON.

26:45.700 --> 26:47.327
SO NOW THE PAPERWORK.

26:47.370 --> 26:49.861
I JUST WANTED
TO STOP BY AND...

26:49.900 --> 26:51.868
GIVE YOU THIS.

26:51.910 --> 26:53.138
WHAT IS THAT?

26:53.170 --> 26:54.706
A CUPCAKE.

26:54.740 --> 26:55.729
I CAN SEE THAT.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.668
BUT WHY ARE YOU
GIVING IT TO ME?

26:57.710 --> 26:59.905
I NOTICED
THAT YOU WERE EATING ONE

26:59.950 --> 27:00.939
WITH YOUR LUNCH
THE OTHER DAY,

27:00.980 --> 27:03.744
SO I STOPPED
AND BOUGHT YOU ONE.

27:03.790 --> 27:04.643
SAME KIND, RED VELVET.

27:04.690 --> 27:06.715
YOU, UM--YOU NOTICED
WHAT I WAS EATING.

27:06.750 --> 27:09.355
WELL, YEAH,
I'M A DETECTIVE.

27:09.390 --> 27:10.652
I NOTICE DETAILS.

27:10.690 --> 27:11.452
REALLY?

27:11.490 --> 27:13.253
WHAT ELSE
DID YOU NOTICE ABOUT ME?

27:13.290 --> 27:17.124
WELL, I NOTICE THAT YOU EAT
BY YOURSELF EVERY DAY.

27:17.160 --> 27:19.663
I NOTICE THAT YOU HESITATE
TO MAKE EYE CONTACT

27:19.700 --> 27:21.668
WITH PEOPLE.

27:21.700 --> 27:22.769
AND, WELL, YOU CAN...

27:22.800 --> 27:24.438
BE A LITTLE ABRASIVE.

27:24.470 --> 27:26.904
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S PROBABLY JUST BECAUSE

27:26.940 --> 27:28.237
IT'S HARD TO ADAPT.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.838
YOU KNOW,
LOTS OF POLITICS.

27:29.880 --> 27:32.075
IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND
WHERE EVERYONE'S COMING FROM.

27:34.780 --> 27:36.714
I THINK I'M GETTING
A PRETTY GOOD IDEA.

27:36.750 --> 27:41.687
GOOD.
I'M GLAD.

27:41.720 --> 27:44.280
SERENA!
WHOO!

27:44.330 --> 27:45.729
SERENA!

27:45.760 --> 27:49.150
DAD!
YOU'RE HERE!

27:49.200 --> 27:50.758
IAM.

27:50.800 --> 27:51.698
YOU HAVE
TO TRY THIS SANDWICH.

27:51.730 --> 27:53.266
KELLY FROM CRAFT SERVICE
MAKES THEM FOR ME.

27:53.300 --> 27:54.699
I ALREADY ATE LUNCH, SHAWN.
WHY AM I HERE?

27:54.740 --> 27:55.729
THIS ISN'T LUNCH.

27:55.770 --> 27:58.204
THIS IS TURKEY...

27:58.240 --> 27:59.764
WITH STUFFING AND CRANBERRY.

27:59.810 --> 28:02.074
IT'S LIKE THANKSGIVING
BETWEEN TWO SLICES OF BREAD.

28:02.110 --> 28:05.477
THIS WHOLE PLACE IS LIKE
LEAVING LAS VEGAS WITH FOOD.

28:05.510 --> 28:06.772
SHAWN, WHY'D YOU ASK ME HERE?

28:06.810 --> 28:08.971
I THOUGHT YOU'D ENJOY IT.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.146
YOU SAID YOU NEVER
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY

28:10.180 --> 28:11.317
TO VISIT ME
WHEN I WAS WORKING A REAL JOB,

28:11.350 --> 28:12.339
AND NOW I HAVE A REAL JOB!

28:12.390 --> 28:14.153
SHAWN,
THIS IS NOT A REAL JOB.

28:14.190 --> 28:15.088
SURE IT IS.

28:15.120 --> 28:16.758
OH NO, I THINK I GOT MAKE-UP
ON THIS T-SHIRT.

28:16.790 --> 28:18.189
HAS ANYONE SEEN IVAN?

28:18.230 --> 28:19.788
ACTING IS NOT
A REAL JOB, SHAWN.

28:19.830 --> 28:21.092
I MEAN, HOW MUCH ATTENTION
DO YOU NEED?

28:21.130 --> 28:23.826
I'M NOT DOING THIS
FOR THE ATTENTION.

28:23.870 --> 28:25.269
[shutter clicks]

28:25.300 --> 28:27.734
I HAPPEN TO BE
SOLVING A CASE.

28:27.770 --> 28:28.794
A MURDER.
THIS IS SERIOUS BUSINESS.

28:28.840 --> 28:30.159
I'VE GOT A GUY
SITTING IN JAIL.

28:30.200 --> 28:31.508
LASSITER'S GOT
SOME EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM,

28:31.540 --> 28:32.734
BUT I KNOW
HE DIDN'T DO IT.

28:32.770 --> 28:33.873
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

28:33.910 --> 28:34.979
HE'S A WRITER.
HE'S GOT NO MOTIVE.

28:35.010 --> 28:36.170
WELL, MOTIVE IS EVERYTHING.

28:36.210 --> 28:38.474
NO MOTIVE, NO CONVICTION.
HEY, CHAD!

28:38.510 --> 28:40.273
HOW DO YOU HAVE FANS?

28:40.310 --> 28:41.174
THIS IS ASININE.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.778
YOU STARTED ON THE SHOW
FIVE DAYS AGO.

28:42.820 --> 28:44.014
LOOK, I HAVE SOMETHING.

28:44.050 --> 28:46.439
DID YOU EVER THINK THAT MAYBE
THIS IS EMBARRASSING FOR ME?

28:46.490 --> 28:47.240
EMBARRASSING FOR YOU?

28:47.290 --> 28:48.917
FIRST OFF,
YOUR ACCENT IS TERRIBLE.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.052
IT'S DISGRACEFUL, REALLY.

28:50.090 --> 28:52.024
YOU SOUND LIKE
THAT EL POLLO LOCO GUY.

28:52.060 --> 28:54.358
AND THEN, THERE YOU GO,
TURNING YOUR BACK ON RINALDO,

28:54.400 --> 28:56.254
EVEN AFTER HE DEFENDED YOU
WHEN YOU WERE ACCUSED

28:56.300 --> 28:58.928
OF MARIA'S KIDNAPPING--
COME ON.

28:58.970 --> 29:00.494
FIRST OF ALL,
I AM TRYING TO SOUND LIKE

29:00.530 --> 29:01.531
THE EL POLLO LOCO GUY.

29:01.570 --> 29:02.639
AND SECONDLY,

29:02.670 --> 29:04.035
RINALDO TURNED HIS BACK ON ME
WHEN HE SLEPT WITH MARIA

29:04.070 --> 29:05.230
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

29:05.270 --> 29:06.999
OH, COME ON, HE WOULD HAVE
GIVEN YOU HALF THE REWARD MONEY!

29:07.040 --> 29:08.302
WHERE'S YOUR INTEGRITY?

29:08.340 --> 29:10.808
IT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE
SUCH A BAD PERSON.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.841
I'M SHAWN.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.768
THOSE ARE THINGS
THAT MY CHARACTER CHAD DID.

29:14.820 --> 29:17.516
I PLAY HIM ON TV.
IT'S SHAWN.

29:17.550 --> 29:19.541
SHAWNY.

29:19.590 --> 29:22.218
LOOK INTO YOUR BOY'S EYES.

29:22.260 --> 29:23.818
IT'S ME, PAPA.

29:23.860 --> 29:24.849
DON'T BE AN IDIOT.

29:24.890 --> 29:26.050
I'M NOT ONE OF YOUR FANS.

29:26.090 --> 29:27.489
I BARELY EVEN LIKE YOU.

29:27.530 --> 29:29.828
THAT'S IT.

29:29.860 --> 29:31.464
IF MY OWN FATHER
CAN BLUR THE LINES

29:31.500 --> 29:34.833
BETWEEN THE SHOW AND REALITY,
WHY COULDN'T SOMEONE ELSE?

29:34.870 --> 29:37.168
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
IN THE WRONG PLACE.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.907
IT'S FANS.

29:39.940 --> 29:42.932
OKAY, SO YOU'VE NARROWED
IT DOWN TO 150 SUSPECT S.

29:42.980 --> 29:44.174
GOOD WORK, SHAWN.

29:44.210 --> 29:45.939
(man)
I WANT YOUR BABY!

29:45.980 --> 29:47.971
I WANT YOUR BABY!

29:48.020 --> 29:50.079
I DON'T HAVE
ANY FEMALE FANS?

29:50.120 --> 29:51.382
LISTEN, LANCE.

29:51.420 --> 29:52.842
LASSITER DOESN'T
HAVE ENOUGH

29:52.890 --> 29:53.811
TO MAKE
THIS ARREST STICK.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.555
HE'S JUST HOPING
THAT A COUPLE NIGHTS IN JAIL

29:55.590 --> 29:56.557
WILL GET YOU TO CONFESS.

29:56.590 --> 29:57.989
A COUPLE NIGHTS?
NO, NO, NO, NO.

29:58.030 --> 29:59.019
HERE'S THE THING.

29:59.060 --> 30:01.824
I ACTUALLY LIKE IT IN HERE.

30:01.860 --> 30:03.521
THIS IS FUEL FOR THE SHOW.

30:03.560 --> 30:04.629
IT'S FUEL FOR ME.

30:04.670 --> 30:05.989
I ALWAYS FELT THERE WAS
SOMETHING HOLDING ME BACK

30:06.030 --> 30:06.997
AS A WRITER.

30:07.030 --> 30:08.497
I GREW UP
IN BEVERLY HILLS.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.462
AND I ALWAYS FELT THAT
I LACKED ANY...

30:10.500 --> 30:12.559
REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE.

30:12.610 --> 30:14.134
SHAWN, THIS IS SO GOOD FOR ME.

30:14.180 --> 30:16.273
IT'S LIKE HEMINGWAY,
LIKE ELLROY, STEINBECK.

30:16.310 --> 30:17.299
DANIELLE STEEL.

30:17.340 --> 30:18.898
ETHAN HAWKE.

30:18.950 --> 30:19.939
JUDY BLUME.

30:19.980 --> 30:21.208
EXACTLY.

30:21.250 --> 30:23.548
I CAN WALLOW
IN THE HARSH UNDERBELLY

30:23.580 --> 30:24.581
OF PRISON LIFE.

30:24.620 --> 30:27.145
AND SHAKE IT UP A LITTLE BIT
WITH THE RIFF-RAFF.

30:27.190 --> 30:28.885
UH, THE RIFF-RAFF?

30:28.920 --> 30:31.059
THIS IS
THE SANTA BARBARA JAIL.

30:31.090 --> 30:32.387
NOT SAN QUENTIN.

30:32.430 --> 30:34.022
IT WAS WRITTEN UP
IN FODOR'S LAST YEAR

30:34.060 --> 30:35.857
AS A NICE SPA ALTERNATIVE.

30:35.900 --> 30:36.958
WE NEED
TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE

30:37.000 --> 30:37.967
SO YOU CAN WRITE THE SHOW.

30:38.000 --> 30:38.967
EVERYONE NEEDS YOU.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.139
NO, NO, NO,
I CAN WRITE IN HERE.

30:41.170 --> 30:44.469
I CAN SCRATCH IT OUT
WITH A BROKEN PIECE OF LEAD

30:44.510 --> 30:45.465
IN THE DARK.

30:45.510 --> 30:46.863
AND THEN I CAN...

30:46.910 --> 30:48.207
BURY MYSELF
IN THE ONE NON-DOWN PILLOW

30:48.240 --> 30:50.333
THEY ISSUED ME
AND I CAN CRY MYSELF TO SLEEP.

30:50.380 --> 30:52.644
LOOK, WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT CORRINE.

30:52.680 --> 30:53.647
CORRINE?

30:53.680 --> 30:54.647
[rolling the "R"s]
CORRINE.

30:54.680 --> 30:55.647
OH, CORRINE.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.409
YES, IT CAME TO ME
IN A VISION.

30:57.450 --> 30:59.441
THE MURDERER IS DOING THIS
TO PROTECT HER.

30:59.490 --> 31:01.117
THINK ABOUT IT.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.481
FIRST, ERNESTO
CHEATED ON HER.

31:03.520 --> 31:05.021
AND WAS STABBED AND KILLED.

31:05.060 --> 31:07.187
THEN YOU WROTE
THAT VINCENTE BETRAYED HER

31:07.230 --> 31:08.595
AND WENT MISSING.

31:08.630 --> 31:09.597
SOMEONE...

31:09.630 --> 31:10.597
TOOK IT
INTO THEIR OWN HANDS

31:10.630 --> 31:12.518
AND TRIED TO KILL HIM.

31:12.570 --> 31:14.993
WELL, NOT VINCENTE,
BUT JORGE.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.166
THAT'S MY POINT.

31:16.200 --> 31:18.168
THEY CAN'T TELL
THE DIFFERENCE.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.030
IT'S A FAN.

31:20.070 --> 31:21.401
THAT'S INTERESTING.

31:21.440 --> 31:23.032
I'M NOT DISAGREEING,
BUT WHAT'S ACT TWO?

31:23.080 --> 31:23.808
I MEAN,

31:23.840 --> 31:25.307
LET'S SAY IT IS
JUST ONE FAN.

31:25.350 --> 31:26.999
HOW YOU GONNA FIND ONE FAN
AMONG THOUSANDS?

31:27.050 --> 31:30.144
EASY.
THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN.

31:30.180 --> 31:31.317
YOU JUST WRITE ME
A STORYLINE

31:31.350 --> 31:33.910
WHERE I PUT CORRINE'S LIFE
IN JEOPARDY.

31:33.960 --> 31:36.019
THEN WE WON'T HAVE
TO GO LOOKING FOR THE MURDERER.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.984
THE MURDERER
WILL COME LOOKING FOR ME.

31:44.170 --> 31:45.592
AH!

31:45.630 --> 31:47.029
[speaking Spanish]

31:51.510 --> 31:52.966
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME,
CHIEF?

31:53.010 --> 31:54.477
OH, MM.

31:54.510 --> 31:55.977
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

31:56.980 --> 31:57.947
DID THE ROTHSTEIN ARREST
NOT STICK?

31:57.980 --> 31:59.572
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
THE NUNEZ CASE.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.347
THIS IS ABOUT THE NEW TRANSFER,
PENNY PASCORETTI.

32:03.380 --> 32:05.086
WANTED TO HEAR YOUR SIDE.

32:05.120 --> 32:07.486
MY SIDE?
MY SIDE OF WHAT?

32:07.520 --> 32:10.159
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
A DELICATE WAY TO PUT THIS.

32:10.190 --> 32:12.658
MS. PASCORETTI HAS FILED
AN INTERDEPARTMENTAL

32:12.690 --> 32:14.089
HARASSMENT CHARGE
AGAINST YOU.

32:14.130 --> 32:16.098
WHAT?
THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS!

32:16.130 --> 32:18.564
IS THERE ANY TRUTH
TO THIS CLAIM?

32:18.600 --> 32:21.660
I WAS JUST BEING NICE.

32:21.700 --> 32:23.565
REACHING OUT.
I BOUGHT HER A CUPCAKE.

32:23.600 --> 32:24.567
SUE ME.

32:24.610 --> 32:25.736
SHE IS.

32:25.770 --> 32:26.964
WHAT DO YOU MEAN

32:27.010 --> 32:28.568
YOU BOUGHT HER
A CUPCAKE?

32:28.610 --> 32:30.475
WITH THIS PIECE
OF INFORMATION,

32:30.510 --> 32:33.047
YOU'RE LUCKY THE CHARGE
DIDN'T INCLUDE A STALKING CLAIM.

32:33.080 --> 32:35.514
I WAS JUST
TRYING TO MAKE A FRIEND.

32:35.550 --> 32:37.541
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
A PIECE OF ADVICE.

32:37.580 --> 32:39.309
AND TAKE IT.

32:39.350 --> 32:40.715
AS A WOMAN
IN THIS DEPARTMENT,

32:40.750 --> 32:43.116
YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL
HOW YOU GO ABOUT

32:43.160 --> 32:44.650
FORMING FRIENDSHIPS.

32:44.690 --> 32:46.624
WOMEN IN THE LINE
OF POLICE WORK

32:46.660 --> 32:48.321
ARE MORE CAUTIOUS BY NATURE
AND NECESSITY,

32:48.360 --> 32:49.759
AND SLOW TO TRUST.

32:49.800 --> 32:53.065
WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE,
I GUESS NO WOMAN

32:53.100 --> 32:54.089
HAS A FRIEND
IN THE DEPARTMENT.

32:54.140 --> 32:55.664
THAT'S RIGHT.

32:55.700 --> 33:00.205
OH, 'CAUSE I KIND
OF THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS.

33:00.240 --> 33:01.605
WELL, YOU WERE WRONG.

33:01.640 --> 33:03.471
I'LL TALK
TO MS. PASCORETTI

33:03.510 --> 33:06.240
AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO
TO MITIGATE THESE CHARGES.

33:06.280 --> 33:10.114
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,
STOP BUYING PASTRIES.

33:10.150 --> 33:11.447
YOU'RE EXCUSED.

33:15.520 --> 33:17.579
NICE BLOUSE.

33:17.620 --> 33:20.020
OH. THANKS.

33:20.060 --> 33:22.199
I GOT IT AT NORDSTROM,
IT WAS ON THE SALE RACK.

33:22.230 --> 33:23.492
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T--
I DON'T CARE.

33:23.530 --> 33:26.226
BUT YOU ASKED--
ENOUGH, O'HARA. GOODBYE.

33:36.110 --> 33:38.374
[speaking Spanish]

33:38.410 --> 33:40.071
[romantic music plays]

33:40.110 --> 33:41.111
MM.

33:41.150 --> 33:43.311
UM...WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

33:43.350 --> 33:45.113
THE SHOW'S FALLEN BEHIND.

33:45.150 --> 33:46.412
AND THE NETWORK SAYS

33:46.450 --> 33:47.712
THE ONLY WAY WE CAN
STAY ON SCHEDULE

33:47.750 --> 33:50.287
IS IF WE DO THE SHOW
ON FRIDAY, LIVE.

33:50.320 --> 33:52.254
WHICH MEANS WE NEED
A SCRIPT TONIGHT!

33:52.290 --> 33:53.723
[bangs table]
IS THAT POSSIBLE?

33:53.760 --> 33:55.159
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

33:55.200 --> 33:56.497
I'VE NEVER BEEN
MORE INSPIRED IN MY LIFE.

33:56.530 --> 33:58.088
SWEET! HERE'S THE CATCH.

33:58.130 --> 34:00.098
NOW THAT YOU'VE HAD ME
CHEAT ON CORRINE,

34:00.130 --> 34:03.361
I NEED YOU TO PUT OUT NEW PAGES,
WITH A NEW MURDER WEAPON,

34:03.400 --> 34:05.368
AND A SCENE WHERE CORRINE
COMES AFTER ME.

34:05.410 --> 34:07.105
THAT'S A TERRIBLE PITCH.
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

34:07.140 --> 34:10.598
BECAUSE, LANCE, THE MURDERER'S
GOING TO TRY AND FINISH THE JOB.

34:10.640 --> 34:12.642
WHOEVER IT IS HAS ACCESS
TO THE SCRIPTS

34:12.680 --> 34:14.648
AND WILL BE PAYING VERY CLOSE
ATTENTION TO THE MURDER WEAPON

34:14.680 --> 34:17.240
AND WILL LIKELY TAMPER
WITH IT TOMORROW.

34:17.280 --> 34:19.248
BUT I'LL BE THERE
TO CATCH THEM.

34:24.290 --> 34:25.484
ALL RIGHT, SPENCER,

34:25.530 --> 34:27.418
I TRUST YOU'RE CONFIDENT
THIS ELABORATE CHARADE

34:27.460 --> 34:29.428
IS GOING TO BE FRUITFUL
FOR THE CASE?

34:29.460 --> 34:30.688
CONFIDENCE IS NOT
MY PROBLEM.

34:30.730 --> 34:31.492
DRY LIPS, HOWEVER...

34:31.530 --> 34:33.464
PEARL, MAKE IT NICE
FOR THE KISSERS.

34:33.500 --> 34:35.468
MR. SPENCER, WE'RE READY
FOR YOU ON SET.

34:35.500 --> 34:37.161
WE'RE MOMENTS AWAY
FROM GOING LIVE.

34:37.200 --> 34:38.269
OKAY, SO WHAT'S OUR PLAN?

34:38.310 --> 34:40.232
WELL, LANCE WROTE THIS LONG
MONOLOGUE FOR CORRINE

34:40.270 --> 34:41.601
AFTER MY EXIT.

34:41.640 --> 34:43.699
THAT GIVES ME PLENTY OF TIME
TO MAKE MY COSTUME CHANGE,

34:43.740 --> 34:45.207
SO I'LL MEET YOU
BACKSTAGE THEN.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.400
KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED
FOR ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS.

34:47.450 --> 34:48.542
GOT IT.

34:48.580 --> 34:51.515
WE'RE SECONDS AWAY FROM LIVE!
PLACES, EVERYBODY, PLACES!

34:51.550 --> 34:53.711
IN FOUR...THREE...

34:53.750 --> 34:54.717
TWO...

34:54.760 --> 34:55.715
AND...GO!

34:55.760 --> 34:57.751
[romantic music,
thunderclaps]

35:05.300 --> 35:08.428
[speaking Spanish]

35:30.220 --> 35:32.154
I DIDN'T WRITE THAT.

35:32.190 --> 35:34.329
[softly]
IMPROVISATION. I LIKE IT.

35:34.360 --> 35:35.327
[with heavy Spanish accent]
YES.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.726
[speaking Spanish]

36:13.300 --> 36:15.564
[thunderclaps]

36:19.340 --> 36:21.308
OH, THIS CAN'T BE GOOD.

36:21.340 --> 36:24.969
DUDE, DID ANYONE COME
NEAR THE PROP TABLE?

36:25.010 --> 36:26.568
WHAT PROP TABLE?

36:26.610 --> 36:27.872
I'VE BEEN GLUED TO THE TV,

36:27.910 --> 36:28.945
WATCHING FOR ANYTHING
SUSPICIOUS TO HAPPEN,

36:28.980 --> 36:30.208
LIKE YOU SAID.

36:30.250 --> 36:31.069
DUDE, YOU'RE JUST
STANDING THERE

36:31.120 --> 36:32.087
EATING A MEATBALL,
WATCHING THE SHOW.

36:32.120 --> 36:33.917
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE WATCHING
THE PROP TABLE!

36:33.950 --> 36:36.384
YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT A PROP TABLE, SHAWN.

36:36.420 --> 36:37.648
IF YOU WOULDA SAID
WATCH THE PROP TABLE,

36:37.690 --> 36:39.453
I WOULD HAVE BEEN
WATCHING THE PROP TABLE.

36:39.490 --> 36:42.288
WHOEVER TAMPERED WITH THAT
NAIL GUN IS OUR KILLER, GUS.

36:42.330 --> 36:43.797
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT MY LIFE HERE!

36:43.830 --> 36:45.764
I KNOW, SHAWN.
THIS WOMAN IS CRAZY.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.768
SHE'S GONNA KILL YOU.

36:47.800 --> 36:49.529
LOOK, FORGET IT, OKAY?
JUST FORGET IT.

36:49.570 --> 36:52.232
I'LL CHECK
THE NAIL GUN MYSELF.

36:52.270 --> 36:54.830
DO ME A FAVOR, AND SAVE ME
ONE OF THOSE MEATBALLS, YEAH?

36:54.880 --> 36:56.438
LET'S GO.

36:56.480 --> 36:57.708
YOU GOTTA GET OUT THERE.

36:57.740 --> 36:59.469
THIS IS NO TIME
FOR PRANKS, ROGER.

36:59.510 --> 37:01.671
THERE'S STILL HALF A SCENE
BEFORE I MAKE MY ENTRANCE.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.312
NOT ANYMORE.
SHE'S ALL OVER THE PLACE.

37:03.350 --> 37:04.612
SHE JUST SKIPPED AHEAD
THREE PAGES.

37:04.650 --> 37:06.242
YOU'RE ON!

37:06.290 --> 37:07.348
GUS?

37:07.390 --> 37:08.652
BE STRONG, SHAWN.

37:11.390 --> 37:13.688
[thunderclaps]

37:13.730 --> 37:15.857
[speaking Spanish]

37:23.500 --> 37:26.867
[faux Spanish accent]
OKAY...HERE YOU GO.

37:26.910 --> 37:28.730
BUT DO NOT
POINT THIS AT ME,

37:28.780 --> 37:30.407
BECAUSE ES MUCHO
DANGERIOSO.

37:30.440 --> 37:32.442
[speaking Spanish]

37:32.480 --> 37:34.311
UH...YOU SAY THAT YOU KNOW,
BUT SERIOUSLY.

37:34.350 --> 37:35.817
BE VERY CAREFULIO.

37:35.850 --> 37:36.919
YOU COULD MORTE ME
WITH THIS THING

37:36.950 --> 37:39.339
BECAUSE IT IS REALIO
AS IT GETS!

37:39.390 --> 37:41.654
[softly]
I LOVE THE IMPROV.
THE PASSION.

37:41.690 --> 37:43.317
NOT AN IMPROV!

37:43.360 --> 37:45.624
[speaking Spanish]

37:52.730 --> 37:54.630
SHAWN IS THE FATHER
OF SERENA'S BABY!

37:54.670 --> 37:57.366
[softly]
PLEASE PUT THAT DOWN, WOMAN,
IT'S LOADED WITH REAL NAILS!

37:57.400 --> 38:00.460
[speaking Spanish]

38:00.510 --> 38:01.477
SHAWN, WATCH OUT!
WATCH OUT!

38:11.390 --> 38:12.982
NO!

38:13.020 --> 38:14.681
[heavy accent]
YOU ARE WRONG!

38:14.720 --> 38:17.018
I AM NOT A MURDERER-O!

38:17.060 --> 38:18.948
BUT I KNOW WHO IS-O.

38:18.990 --> 38:23.654
YES...YOUR TWIN SISTER.

38:23.700 --> 38:26.066
[speaking Spanish]

38:26.100 --> 38:28.660
YES, WHAT I MEAN IS,

38:28.700 --> 38:31.635
IT'S SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO BE
YOUR TWIN SISTER.

38:31.670 --> 38:34.935
SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO BE YOU!

38:34.980 --> 38:36.936
I DEFINITELY DID NOT WRITE THIS.

38:36.980 --> 38:38.470
OKAY, I DON'T GET IT.

38:38.510 --> 38:40.569
NO, IT'S LIKE, EH...

38:40.610 --> 38:42.544
[speaking Spanish]

38:46.490 --> 38:47.741
MY GOD, HE'S IMPROVISING.

38:49.020 --> 38:51.454
I...CAN'T DO THIS!

38:51.490 --> 38:55.096
UH, YOU MAKE
A TRANSLATION FOR ME, YEAH?

38:55.130 --> 38:57.997
AH, HIGH SCHOOL SPANISH
COMES BACK TO HAUNT HIM.

38:58.030 --> 38:59.463
[whispering]

38:59.500 --> 39:01.127
SHE DID IT!

39:01.170 --> 39:02.831
PAN OVER. PAN OVER!

39:02.870 --> 39:05.668
[portentous music]

39:05.710 --> 39:06.961
[thunder rumbling]

39:07.010 --> 39:09.433
AFTER ALL THAT, YOU JUST
POINT AT THE MURDERER?

39:09.480 --> 39:11.505
DON'T YOU HAVE ANY SENSE
OF DRAMATIC TENSION OR BUILD?

39:11.550 --> 39:12.847
COME ON,
WHAT ARE WE, ON BLOSSOM?

39:12.880 --> 39:15.144
NO! YOU START BY SAYING
SHE WAS YOUR BIGGEST FAN.

39:15.180 --> 39:16.408
YOU KNOW, THAT SHE
PRACTICALLY WORSHIPS YOU.

39:16.450 --> 39:17.519
SHE READ ALL THE SCRIPTS.

39:17.550 --> 39:20.485
I GOT THIS, I GOT THIS--
YOU! YES, YOU!

39:20.520 --> 39:23.387
[heavy accent]
YOU HATED IT WHENEVER
CORINNE WAS PUT INTO JEOPARDY.

39:23.420 --> 39:26.526
SO YOU TOOK IT UPON YOURSELF
TO AVENGE HER.

39:26.560 --> 39:28.027
I HAD TO.

39:28.060 --> 39:29.755
SHE CARES TOO MUCH.

39:29.800 --> 39:32.121
HER HEART IS TOO BIG
FOR HER CHEST.

39:32.170 --> 39:34.161
WHEN ERNESTO CHEATED ON HER,

39:34.200 --> 39:36.794
SHE WAS TOO WEAK TO STAND UP
FOR HERSELF.

39:36.840 --> 39:39.502
I NEEDED TO HELP HER.

39:39.540 --> 39:41.974
SHE WAS LIKE MY BEST FRIEND.

39:42.010 --> 39:43.637
I BARELY SPOKE TO HER.

39:43.680 --> 39:44.669
REALLY?

39:44.710 --> 39:46.109
SO IT WAS YOU

39:46.150 --> 39:49.074
WHO REPLACED THE RETRACTABLE
PROP KNIFE WITH THE REAL ONE!

39:49.120 --> 39:50.815
AND HE DESERVED IT.

39:50.850 --> 39:54.616
AND IT WAS ALSO YOU
WHO POISONED POOR VINCENTE

39:54.660 --> 39:56.616
AFTER IT WAS WRITTEN
THAT HE BETRAYED CORINNE.

39:56.660 --> 39:57.456
BUT HOW?

39:57.490 --> 39:59.151
WITH A MEATBALL.

39:59.190 --> 40:01.590
(Jorge)
USUALLY I HUNGER FOR HER
MEATBALLS THE WAY A JACKAL

40:01.630 --> 40:03.723
SALIVATES FOR
AN INJURED POSSUM.

40:03.760 --> 40:05.523
BUT HE WROTE
A SUICIDE NOTE.

40:05.570 --> 40:06.594
NO, HE DIDN'T.

40:06.630 --> 40:09.497
YOU SHOULD HAVE A DEGREE
IN BEING WRONG ALL THE TIME.

40:09.540 --> 40:11.929
AND SHE ALMOST
GOT AWAY WITH IT!

40:11.970 --> 40:13.767
IF IT WAS NOT FOR THE HAIRS.

40:13.810 --> 40:14.777
THE HAIRS?

40:14.810 --> 40:15.777
YES, THE HAIRS.

40:15.810 --> 40:17.607
FROM THE CHEAP IMITATION WIG

40:17.640 --> 40:19.608
THAT YOU PUT ON
TO EMULATE CORINNE

40:19.650 --> 40:21.914
WHEN YOU COMMITTED
THESE MURDERS!
