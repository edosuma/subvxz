WEBVTT

00:04.272 --> 00:06.140
(honking)

00:06.174 --> 00:09.043
MAN: Well, I felt bad
about coming home late.

00:09.077 --> 00:10.578
So I decided to set the table.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.180
Well, that's
very nice of you.

00:12.213 --> 00:13.814
One would think.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.150
But she got all freaked out
because I used paper towels

00:16.184 --> 00:18.186
instead of napkins.
Same thing.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.720
Thank you.
Yeah.

00:19.753 --> 00:22.756
So I say to her, "You go
get your flippin' napkins.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.193
And while you're up,
get me another beer."

00:25.226 --> 00:26.594
(chuckles): Yeah.
Uh-huh.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.829
What'd you really say?

00:28.862 --> 00:31.132
"Sorry, dear."

00:31.165 --> 00:32.066
(both laugh)

00:32.100 --> 00:33.667
Oh.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.103
Will you
look at this?

00:35.136 --> 00:36.770
Hello?

00:36.804 --> 00:38.139
Where's the groundskeeper?

00:43.244 --> 00:44.545
Wha...

00:46.180 --> 00:48.116
(scoffs)

00:48.149 --> 00:50.218
There... there we go.
(grunts)

00:50.251 --> 00:52.086
Hey, what are you doing?

00:52.120 --> 00:55.123
I am following
the rules of golf.

00:55.156 --> 00:57.591
You play the ball
where the ball lies.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.527
Come on, Hank.
What am I supposed to do here?

00:59.560 --> 01:01.529
Hey, a bet is a bet.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.564
Okay. Fine.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.603
Whoa, J-J...
Hey, Joe,

01:09.637 --> 01:12.106
whoa, whoa, come on.
Be careful.

01:12.140 --> 01:14.208
This hole's worth three bucks.

01:14.242 --> 01:15.543
Yeah.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.145
(engine starts)

01:17.178 --> 01:18.512
What are you...

01:22.650 --> 01:25.153
(clattering, buzzing)

01:25.186 --> 01:27.421
Oh, great.
I think you broke it.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.797
What the hell?

01:38.466 --> 01:39.800
Bet's off.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.605
*

02:15.436 --> 02:17.171
(indistinct conversations)

02:21.575 --> 02:23.711
Hi.
Hi, Nick.

02:23.744 --> 02:26.314
Good morning, Nick.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.349
How are you on this fine day?

02:28.382 --> 02:30.784
Can I just say...
you look great.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.686
Well, I don't feel great.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.722
Long night.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.458
You know what helps me shake off
the cobwebs in the morning?
What?

02:37.491 --> 02:39.560
A brisk five-mile walk.

02:39.593 --> 02:42.296
Better pick-me-up than caffeine.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.965
Oh, yeah. You're here
for that thing, right?

02:44.998 --> 02:47.301
If by "that thing," you're
talking about Inclusion Town,

02:47.335 --> 02:49.737
a charity that builds
playgrounds for kids

02:49.770 --> 02:53.241
with disabilities, then yes,
you're right on the nose.

02:53.274 --> 02:54.708
(sharp inhale) Okay, well,
here's the thing, man--

02:54.742 --> 02:56.544
I don't think
I have any cash.

02:56.577 --> 02:57.911
Way ahead of you, Nick. Now
we can donate electronically.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.713
Hey, hey,
don't touch that.

02:59.747 --> 03:03.251
I already took the liberty of
logging onto the online portal.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.486
You're just a few clicks away
from changing lives.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.355
Wh... Uh, what about Bishop?
Donated.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.489
And McGee?
Donated.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.358
Riggs.
Donated.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.760
I gave a few quid, mate.
It's for the kids.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.264
All right, all right.
How do I do this?

03:16.297 --> 03:18.766
Look, all you have to do--
enter your credit card info...

03:18.799 --> 03:20.401
and the amount.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.570
Bing, bang, boom.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.572
And thank you.

03:26.574 --> 03:27.741
How much is a few quid?

03:27.775 --> 03:30.311
40 U.S. dollars.
We all gave the same.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.282
GIBBS:
Gear up, Torres.

03:34.315 --> 03:35.616
Dead petty officer
at Quantico.

03:35.649 --> 03:38.018
On my way.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.688
Torres! Come on.
Coming, coming, coming,
hold on.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.524
Done. Coming.

03:43.557 --> 03:44.858
REEVES:
Yeah, I'll hold.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.595
Aw, come on.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.303
Hey. What do we have?
Our victim

03:55.336 --> 03:58.038
is Navy Petty Officer
Second Class Jake Miller.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.373
Stationed here
in Quantico.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.409
He, uh, died
playing golf?

04:01.442 --> 04:03.644
He was working. He was a
part-time groundskeeper here

04:03.677 --> 04:06.046
to supplement
his Navy income.
Ooh.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.882
Death by lawn mower.
No thank you.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.284
Palmer.
What do we have?

04:10.318 --> 04:12.353
I don't think
the lawn mower killed him.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.788
Why?
There's not enough blood.
I think he was already dead

04:14.822 --> 04:16.290
when the mower ran him over.
TORRES: Who ran him over?

04:16.324 --> 04:17.558
JOE: We didn't know
he was under there

04:17.591 --> 04:20.394
when we started the mower.
We?

04:20.428 --> 04:22.062
Why'd you start the mower?
Hey, you could have

04:22.095 --> 04:24.965
chipped it out. Come on.
That could have
cost me the hole.

04:24.998 --> 04:27.335
You would've never
made the hole.
You know what, if you just

04:27.368 --> 04:28.902
want the three dollars for me,
I'd give it to you.
Okay, gentlemen...

04:28.936 --> 04:30.070
You'd be lucky if you
triple-bogeyed.
Gentlemen!

04:30.103 --> 04:31.405
Did you see anyone else
on the course?

04:31.439 --> 04:34.375
No, no.
We're the dew-sweepers.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.444
The dew-sweepers-- the first
tee time in the morning.

04:36.477 --> 04:39.380
Yeah, it's just us
and the groundskeepers.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.583
MAN:
It's 7:48 a.m.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.984
I'm in the cart barn,

04:44.017 --> 04:45.353
and my phone won't
stop ringing.

04:45.386 --> 04:46.920
It's Joe and Hank,
freaking out.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.756
We didn't touch
the body.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.592
Miller have enemies?
He's too shy to make enemies.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.094
Or friends.
Great employee, though.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.663
Showed up, did his work,

04:55.696 --> 04:57.431
went to his job on the base.

04:57.465 --> 04:58.766
What time
did he show up?
4:00 a.m.,

04:58.799 --> 05:01.101
like, every morning.
I have his timecard.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.537
Palmer, TOD?

05:03.571 --> 05:04.938
Based on the core
temperature,

05:04.972 --> 05:07.508
I'd say closer to
4:00 a.m. than 7:48.

05:07.541 --> 05:08.676
You want me to get this
mower out of your way?

05:08.709 --> 05:10.478
Not yet, thank you.

05:10.511 --> 05:11.479
Any idea how much longer
you guys will be here?

05:11.512 --> 05:12.446
Nope.

05:14.515 --> 05:15.749
McGEE:
Hey, boss?

05:17.418 --> 05:18.886
What'd you find, Tim?

05:18.919 --> 05:20.854
We're gonna need
an evidence box.
Hey!

05:20.888 --> 05:22.456
You messed up my bunker.

05:22.490 --> 05:23.791
This is a golf course,
you know.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.493
Well, right now
it's a crime scene.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.627
But what should I tell
all my golfers?

05:26.660 --> 05:27.628
Tell them that for today,

05:27.661 --> 05:28.762
it's a 17-hole course.

05:35.703 --> 05:38.472
Agent Gibbs. What brings
you down here today?

05:38.506 --> 05:40.140
You called me.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.710
Yeah, specifically to tell you
that I wasn't ready yet.

05:42.743 --> 05:43.977
Oh.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.979
What do you got?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.515
(laughs)

05:47.548 --> 05:48.549
Uh...

05:48.582 --> 05:50.818
Well, I sent his clothes

05:50.851 --> 05:52.553
up to Abby for testing, and
now I'm just collecting

05:52.586 --> 05:54.488
sediment from around the body,

05:54.522 --> 05:56.524
in case there's a foreign hair
or fiber mixed in.

05:56.557 --> 05:59.527
That there on his cheek,
that's just a birthmark,

05:59.560 --> 06:01.562
but there's some major
bruising here on the neck.

06:01.595 --> 06:02.830
No lawnmower did that.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.632
Yeah, I would tend
to agree.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.102
What about that?
That...

06:09.136 --> 06:11.104
that is a catastrophic fracture

06:11.138 --> 06:12.506
of the second
cervical vertebra.

06:12.540 --> 06:13.841
Broken neck.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.176
No blade marks
on his head.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.846
Yet another sign that he was
dead before he was mulched.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.614
I'll know more
after the autopsy.

06:20.648 --> 06:22.516
I need to get this
up to Abby.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.785
Did someone say "Abby"?

06:24.818 --> 06:26.687
Hey, Abby.
GIBBS: Hey, Abbs.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.456
Oh, Gibbs, Gibbs.

06:28.489 --> 06:29.623
Good, you're there.

06:29.657 --> 06:31.559
I have to show you something.

06:31.592 --> 06:35.529
Okay, this is Petty Officer
Miller's work shirt.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.197
This is the front

06:37.230 --> 06:39.600
of Petty Officer Miller's
work shirt.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.869
And this...

06:41.902 --> 06:43.971
is a very large...

06:44.004 --> 06:44.938
Bloodstain.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.039
Yes.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.508
But it's not his blood.

06:47.541 --> 06:48.509
Whose is it?

06:48.542 --> 06:49.577
Could be a second victim.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.479
Could be his killer.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.457
(printer whirring)

07:03.491 --> 07:04.958
TORRES:
Hey.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.094
Oh, thank you.
Motorcycle photos.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.496
It's a Supermoto.

07:08.529 --> 07:09.963
It's a dirt bike
with street tires.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.499
Is it yours?

07:11.532 --> 07:13.233
It will be. I'm getting
a good deal on it.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.802
Hmm.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.971
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.206
I guess I can
do that later.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.477
Hey, you get anything?

07:23.511 --> 07:24.745
Miller's cell phone records.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.480
Six of his last
incoming calls

07:26.514 --> 07:28.516
were from a company called
Southeast Sand and Turf.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.483
About what?

07:29.517 --> 07:30.951
Well, they supply

07:30.984 --> 07:33.654
landscaping products
to golf courses.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.623
Could just be work calls.
Surveillance video

07:35.656 --> 07:37.157
from the golf course
parking lot.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.992
Now, between 3:30 and 7:00
this morning,

07:39.026 --> 07:40.994
nine vehicles entered,
but only one left.

07:41.028 --> 07:44.632
4:21 a.m. It's a red
1995 Ford Aspire.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.133
Now, we can't see
the driver's face,

07:46.166 --> 07:47.267
but we enhanced the plate.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.169
Belongs to an
86-year-old woman,

07:49.202 --> 07:50.971
who reported it
stolen yesterday.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.773
Get a BOLO out.
BOLO. Already got it.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.108
I spoke to his C.O.
Said Miller was a 4-0 sailor.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.945
Kept to himself, few friends,
clean record.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.280
That matches what the golf
course superintendent told us.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.650
McGee, Torres, check out
Miller's apartment.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.184
Reeves?
Nothing!

08:04.217 --> 08:05.586
What are you doing?

08:07.087 --> 08:08.188
Just checking
on my mates.

08:08.221 --> 08:09.690
Go with Bishop.

08:09.723 --> 08:12.259
Landscaping company.
She'll fill you in.

08:16.564 --> 08:18.031
(spooky music and sound effects
playing)
(knock on door)

08:18.065 --> 08:19.967
Good, you're here.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.702
Where else would I be?

08:21.735 --> 08:22.803
Oh.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.672
Hey.
Hey.

08:24.705 --> 08:27.641
The infamous Abby Sciuto.
Italian.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.209
Finally.
Jack Sloane.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.679
I know.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.714
I mean, hello.
Hi.

08:33.747 --> 08:36.216
I heard you're the
welcome wagon around here.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.586
I stopped by a few times,
but I keep missing you, so...

08:38.619 --> 08:41.054
Well, that's weird,
'cause I'm always here.

08:41.088 --> 08:42.656
Wow, cool stuff.

08:42.690 --> 08:45.058
Um, don't you usually
go to the coffee cart

08:45.092 --> 08:46.727
around this time?

08:46.760 --> 08:48.328
Usually.
I mean, not that I've been

08:48.361 --> 08:49.863
tracking you or anything.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.565
It was just, you know,
a really good guess.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.601
I'm headed over to the cart now.

08:53.634 --> 08:54.602
Would you like to join me?

08:54.635 --> 08:55.903
Oh, no, no.
I, uh...

08:55.936 --> 08:58.606
I get my caffeine
through other means.

08:58.639 --> 09:01.675
Oh, yeah, I heard about this.
What's it called?

09:01.709 --> 09:02.743
Caf-POW!

09:02.776 --> 09:04.745
Who told you that?

09:04.778 --> 09:05.913
Why are you studying me?

09:05.946 --> 09:09.049
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.918
I get it now, you think
I'm here to profile you.

09:10.951 --> 09:14.021
You... you don't know
what I think.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.589
You betcha I don't.

09:15.623 --> 09:17.057
I don't read minds,

09:17.090 --> 09:18.926
and I don't profile
in my spare time.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.594
That would be exhausting.

09:20.628 --> 09:23.363
Not as exhausting as

09:23.396 --> 09:25.633
trying to avoid you
all the time.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.935
(chuckles)
I'm sorry.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.069
Oh...

09:29.102 --> 09:32.673
And you really
get around.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.776
Not that you're
tracking me or anything,

09:35.809 --> 09:36.710
or profiling?

09:36.744 --> 09:39.780
Wait, is that what I'm doing?

09:39.813 --> 09:41.281
Profiling the profiler?

09:41.314 --> 09:43.617
(computer beeps)
Saved by the bell.

09:43.651 --> 09:44.652
ABBY:
We got a match.

09:44.685 --> 09:45.753
A lawnmower case.

09:45.786 --> 09:46.954
Okay, so I've matched

09:46.987 --> 09:48.789
the blood from the rake

09:48.822 --> 09:51.291
to the blood on
Petty Officer Miller's shirt.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.626
The blood that wasn't Miller's.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.929
I get around, remember?

09:55.963 --> 09:58.131
Looks like Miller was
trying to use the rake

09:58.165 --> 10:00.100
to defend himself,
unsuccessfully.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.635
So whoever the killer is
is walking around

10:01.669 --> 10:03.403
with a really nasty rake wound.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.706
And will need a doctor.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.076
(indistinct voices outside)

10:09.109 --> 10:11.011
(dog barking)

10:13.714 --> 10:16.116
Wow, just the basics.
I like this guy.

10:16.149 --> 10:18.318
He worked two jobs.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.654
Wonder what he spent
his money on.

10:20.688 --> 10:21.822
Uh, McGee?

10:28.762 --> 10:31.965
TORRES:
Miller was into something weird.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.801
McGEE:
This is not weird.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.703
This is a ham shack.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.671
Huh? What is that,
code for something?

10:37.705 --> 10:39.172
No. No. Ham radio.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.675
Social media before there
was social media.

10:41.709 --> 10:44.945
One-to-one conversations
to hams all over the world.
Huh.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.346
I take you do this?

10:46.379 --> 10:47.781
I used to. Yeah.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.783
My, uh, my dad taught me.

10:49.817 --> 10:52.352
I used to have a friend
named Mark in Copenhagen.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.154
Know what his handle was?
Hmm?

10:54.187 --> 10:56.356
Dane Mark.
Oh.

10:56.389 --> 10:59.827
Yeah. We used to talk for hours.

10:59.860 --> 11:03.063
When I was a kid, my dad used
to sneak me into the cockfights.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.333
Okay.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.804
Oh. What do we got here?

11:10.838 --> 11:11.972
Miller's call log.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.874
List of all
his regular contacts.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.375
Some of them
might know something.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.711
(door opens)

11:17.745 --> 11:19.747
(dogs barking)
Federal agents.

11:19.780 --> 11:20.714
Ah! Uh...

11:20.748 --> 11:21.715
Who are you?

11:21.749 --> 11:22.816
I'm-I'm just the dog walker.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.184
Please, please don't shoot.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.053
NCIS special agents
Torres and McGee.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.320
(dogs barking)

11:27.354 --> 11:29.890
Sorry, they're
just scared.

11:29.923 --> 11:32.092
You came at us with guns. You
could kill someone like that.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.995
Um, excuse me.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.363
Uh, Benji?

11:36.396 --> 11:38.999
Down. Benji. That's enough.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.067
I don't know
what's gotten into him.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.869
He's usually not like that.

11:41.902 --> 11:42.903
I'm sorry, I'll just, uh,

11:42.936 --> 11:44.772
put Spinks back
and then I'll go.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.373
Wait, hold on.
What's your name?

11:46.406 --> 11:48.876
Rhonda. Uh, Rhonda Collins.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.244
Rhonda. Rhonda Collins.
She's Rhonda Collins.

11:51.278 --> 11:54.214
Rhonda, you think you could look
after Spinks for a few days?

11:54.247 --> 11:56.950
Sure. Um, is Jake all right?

11:59.319 --> 12:00.420
Four phone calls, from here?

12:00.453 --> 12:01.922
BISHOP:
Yep. From your company's line

12:01.955 --> 12:03.390
to Petty Officer Miller's
cell phone.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.925
We handle a lot of orders.

12:04.958 --> 12:05.725
That name doesn't ring a bell.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.227
Your company sold
four dozen bags

12:07.260 --> 12:08.929
of bunker sand to Medal of Honor

12:08.962 --> 12:10.931
Golf Course yesterday.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.432
Miller was the groundskeeper
who signed off on it.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.501
Okay, so that's it.

12:17.938 --> 12:18.705
What's it?

12:18.738 --> 12:20.540
That explains
the calls, right?

12:20.573 --> 12:22.776
Is that a question or an answer?

12:22.810 --> 12:24.377
I don't know what
you're getting at.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.046
Why don't you ask him?

12:26.079 --> 12:28.115
Well, he's dead.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.083
(radio crackles,
man speaks Spanish)

12:32.285 --> 12:33.453
(speaks Spanish)

12:33.486 --> 12:35.889
(phone ringing)

12:35.923 --> 12:37.257
This is Bishop.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.892
Rough day?

12:38.926 --> 12:40.427
Like every day.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.830
You own this company?

12:42.863 --> 12:44.464
Got it from my no-good
ex-husband in the divorce.

12:44.497 --> 12:45.966
He got the cabin in Colorado.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.234
Does that sound fair?

12:47.267 --> 12:49.136
Listen, I'm sorry

12:49.169 --> 12:50.804
about your petty officer.

12:50.838 --> 12:52.305
I wish I could help.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.074
(phone ringing)
Excuse me.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.909
(Evelyn shouts in Spanish)
Thank you.

12:55.943 --> 12:57.911
Got a hit on the suspect's car.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.412
Gibbs is meeting us there.

12:59.446 --> 13:00.547
Cool.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.818
(power tool whirring)
(elevator chimes)

13:04.852 --> 13:07.087
All right. The antenna's
hooked up on the roof.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.288
Did you connect the receiver?

13:08.321 --> 13:10.090
Your dork machine
is ready for action.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.424
(chuckles)

13:11.458 --> 13:13.093
Well, make fun all
you want, Torres,

13:13.126 --> 13:15.295
but I'll tell you what,
ham radio is a lifeline

13:15.328 --> 13:16.930
in times of crisis.

13:16.964 --> 13:20.000
Did you know that after 9/11
and Hurricane Katrina,

13:20.033 --> 13:21.168
ham radio was the only way

13:21.201 --> 13:23.003
emergency responders
could communicate?

13:23.036 --> 13:26.473
Wow. It got less dorky.

13:26.506 --> 13:31.011
This is A45J04
calling CQ, CQ, CQ.

13:31.044 --> 13:35.315
This is Alpha 45 Juliet Zero
Four calling CQ, CQ, CQ.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.184
And we're back at full dork.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.852
You really think
we're gonna

13:38.886 --> 13:40.888
get something out of this?

13:40.921 --> 13:41.821
Miller spent hours
on this radio every night,

13:41.855 --> 13:43.857
and he recorded each comm
in his logbook,

13:43.891 --> 13:47.360
so, hoping someone out there
in radioland knows something.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.529
MAN (over radio):
Roger, A45J04.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.031
I hear you five and nine.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.033
How was work, Jaybird?

13:53.066 --> 13:54.634
"Jaybird"?

13:54.667 --> 13:56.904
Well, everyone on the radio
has a handle.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.071
(laughs softly)
What's yours?

14:00.373 --> 14:01.875
Uh, hear you loud and clear.

14:01.909 --> 14:04.011
What are your call letters?
Over.

14:04.044 --> 14:04.945
Slim Tim.

14:06.113 --> 14:07.080
Tiny Tim.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.316
I'm close, huh?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.051
(radio crackling)

14:11.084 --> 14:12.920
Can you identify yourself? Over.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.522
If you must know,
I was The Timinator.

14:17.124 --> 14:20.327
This is Ricochet.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.162
Who is this?

14:22.195 --> 14:24.932
Let's see. Ricochet...

14:24.965 --> 14:26.566
Miller talked to him for
over an hour last night.

14:26.599 --> 14:29.536
It's his final transmission.

14:29.569 --> 14:32.906
Uh, Ricochet, this is
NCIS special agent Tim McGee.

14:32.940 --> 14:36.176
Can you give me your legal name
and location?

14:36.209 --> 14:37.911
Jaybird is dead, isn't he?

14:38.445 --> 14:40.914
Why would you say that?

14:40.948 --> 14:42.582
Last time we talked,
he said he was involved

14:42.615 --> 14:44.417
in something dangerous.

14:44.451 --> 14:46.954
Did he say what?

14:48.321 --> 14:51.925
Ricochet?

14:51.959 --> 14:53.326
Well, we have ourselves a lead.

14:57.297 --> 15:00.100
(horn honking,
dog barking in distance)

15:00.133 --> 15:01.268
Bishop?

15:01.301 --> 15:03.070
I... I-I don't know.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.372
The-the BOLO said the car
was at this location.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.075
There's no 1995 red Fords here.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.709
Where's the LEO
who called it in?
(tires screeching)

15:09.742 --> 15:10.944
Deputy Allen Smedley.
I'm dialing him now.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.946
(siren wailing)

15:12.980 --> 15:14.414
(car door opens)

15:14.447 --> 15:16.349
(phone ringing)

15:19.186 --> 15:20.387
Special Agent Bishop.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.454
BISHOP:
Uh, yep.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.256
That-that's me,
and that was me

15:23.290 --> 15:24.124
on your phone.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.292
Sorry. I, uh...

15:25.325 --> 15:27.127
I had an 803 in progress.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.996
Where is the suspect's vehicle?

15:29.029 --> 15:30.463
It's... damn it.

15:30.497 --> 15:32.232
I had eyes on it.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.601
It was parked right there
20 minutes ago.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.469
But you left?

15:36.503 --> 15:38.138
Darling, I got a whole town
to patrol,

15:38.171 --> 15:39.139
and I can't be
in two places at once.

15:39.172 --> 15:40.273
I'm sorry.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.142
Uh, what's an 803?

15:42.175 --> 15:43.476
Stolen shopping cart.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.145
Y-You have a code for that?

15:45.178 --> 15:46.980
Well, it happens a lot here.

15:47.014 --> 15:48.581
Excuse me.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.483
(car door opens)

15:50.517 --> 15:52.119
BISHOP:
All right.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.487
We're 46 miles away
from the crime scene.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.323
Our suspect laid low
all morning,

15:56.356 --> 15:59.292
and then drove an hour
to this dumpy strip mall?

15:59.326 --> 16:00.493
Why?

16:02.629 --> 16:04.131
Gibbs?

16:04.164 --> 16:06.133
(phones ringing,
indistinct chatter)

16:06.166 --> 16:08.501
(cat mewing, dogs barking)

16:08.535 --> 16:11.171
(door closes)

16:15.242 --> 16:18.478
Uh, what are we doing?

16:18.511 --> 16:20.013
Abby said our suspect

16:20.047 --> 16:21.281
would need to see a doctor.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.016
Yeah, but...
an animal doctor?

16:23.050 --> 16:24.151
We're all animals, Reeves.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.518
DR. CHO:
Apply the salve twice a day,

16:25.552 --> 16:27.187
and it should heal quickly.

16:27.220 --> 16:30.023
In the meantime, Wiggles will
have to wear the cone.

16:32.259 --> 16:33.460
Thank you, Doctor.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.794
Sassafras?

16:34.827 --> 16:37.164
Dr. Cho?

16:37.197 --> 16:39.099
You'll have to make
an appointment.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.169
NCIS.

16:44.271 --> 16:46.039
There someplace we can talk?

16:47.607 --> 16:49.209
A human? Are you serious?

16:49.242 --> 16:50.343
Yes.
Guys, I'm a vet.

16:50.377 --> 16:51.711
Not an answer.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.380
No. A-Absolutely not.
Not only is it forbidden,

16:53.413 --> 16:55.048
I don't have
the proper equipment.

16:55.082 --> 16:56.549
You don't mind if we take
a look around, do you?

16:56.583 --> 16:58.385
I do mind.
I've got a patient waiting.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.320
Please, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

17:00.353 --> 17:03.156
(sighs) Come on.
What are you looking for?

17:03.190 --> 17:05.058
GIBBS: We'll know it
when we see it.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.059
Don't you need a search warrant
or something?

17:06.093 --> 17:07.227
For the garbage?

17:07.260 --> 17:08.495
Be careful.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.496
There's sharps in there.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.397
BISHOP:
Oh, yeah.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.067
I noticed.

17:14.101 --> 17:16.369
Two broken rake tines?

17:16.403 --> 17:19.106
What a load of bollocks.

17:19.139 --> 17:20.107
What?

17:20.140 --> 17:21.208
Cut the crap, Doc.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.511
Please. I can't say anything.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.079
He'll kill me.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.127
What is it?

17:40.160 --> 17:42.795
Rap sheet.

17:42.829 --> 17:45.432
Unauthorized practice
on a human.

17:45.465 --> 17:48.468
You have done this before.

17:48.501 --> 17:51.638
Please. I could lose
my license forever.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.106
Oh, you're gonna lose
more than that.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.177
One time-- one time--
I helped out a guy

17:57.210 --> 17:58.711
with a bullet in his leg.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.280
Said he couldn't
go to the hospital.

18:00.313 --> 18:03.716
I didn't ask questions,
and he paid well.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.218
GIBBS:
Word gets around.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.487
I knew they weren't
all Mother Teresa,

18:07.520 --> 18:09.189
but the money was good.

18:09.222 --> 18:10.557
When I got caught,
my license was suspended,

18:10.590 --> 18:11.891
so I never did it again.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.460
Until today.

18:13.493 --> 18:14.727
I had no choice.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.396
A guy walked in bleeding.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.564
What guy?

18:17.597 --> 18:19.399
Some guy.
(stammers)

18:19.432 --> 18:21.168
I'd never seen him before. I...

18:21.201 --> 18:23.803
I told him I don't work
on people anymore,

18:23.836 --> 18:25.838
but then he threatened to kill
me. What was I supposed to do?

18:25.872 --> 18:27.307
Call the police.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.808
DR. CHO:
I-I made a mistake, I get it.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.810
But the guy was gonna bleed out,
for God's sake.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.280
I saved his life.
GIBBS: He took someone else's.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.182
You saved the life of a killer.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.685
I didn't know.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.853
I-I want to cooperate.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.422
But I don't have
security cameras,

18:42.455 --> 18:44.324
and it's not like
I got his name and number.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.758
Was he wearing gloves?
Actually, yeah.

18:45.792 --> 18:46.726
How did you know?

18:48.728 --> 18:51.764
So he wouldn't leave
fingerprints.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.634
You're gonna sit
with our sketch artist.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.538
Stick to spaying cats.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.507
It's safer.

19:03.643 --> 19:04.777
So.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.280
So? What do you think?

19:07.314 --> 19:09.716
Well, I got to say,
you get results.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.551
(laughs softly) What's
that supposed to mean?

19:11.584 --> 19:13.353
That you're really good
at what you do.

19:13.386 --> 19:16.323
Are you analyzing him or me?

19:16.356 --> 19:17.457
Believe me, you don't
want me to analyze you.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.226
(chuckles)

19:19.259 --> 19:20.527
So, this isn't
our killer's first rodeo,

19:20.560 --> 19:22.262
but you already know that.

19:22.295 --> 19:23.796
Yeah. I do, but I like
to hear it out loud.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.199
Well, he stole a car
so he couldn't be traced,

19:26.233 --> 19:27.734
which makes him smart.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.302
He knew about
the rogue veterinarian,

19:29.336 --> 19:30.803
which makes him connected.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.273
And he covered his tracks,
which is cunning.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.342
This ain't some two-bit thug
who just got in a fight.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.809
This was premeditated.

19:36.843 --> 19:37.810
Why'd he kill Miller?
That's the missing piece

19:37.844 --> 19:39.812
of the puzzle.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.914
Motive. You'll find it.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.916
We'll find it.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.918
With your help.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.887
Jack.

19:54.561 --> 19:55.562
(elevator chimes)

19:57.964 --> 19:59.499
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.335
You are a wonderful human being,
and I love you.

20:02.369 --> 20:03.670
Okay, what are we doing here?

20:03.703 --> 20:04.937
What you did for those kids?

20:04.971 --> 20:06.939
Amazing.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.508
Oh, the donation.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:08.541 --> 20:09.742
Every little bit helps.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.744
Oh, come on.
Generous and humble?

20:11.778 --> 20:13.346
(laughs)
Okay.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.248
Safe space, Jimmy.
Okay. Just promise me

20:15.282 --> 20:16.683
that you're gonna come
to the grand opening

20:16.716 --> 20:17.917
of the new playground
on Saturday.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.319
Will you let me
go if I say yes?

20:19.352 --> 20:20.253
Yes.
Okay, yes.

20:20.287 --> 20:21.288
Yes.
Yes.

20:23.590 --> 20:24.791
What the hell was that?

20:24.824 --> 20:26.293
That's what generosity
looks like.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.193
How much did you give?

20:27.226 --> 20:29.429
50 bucks.
You had to one-up us, did you?

20:29.462 --> 20:30.963
Aw. Do you want a hug, too?
GIBBS:
Hug on your own time.

20:30.997 --> 20:33.700
No, Gibbs.
No, no-- what happened...

20:33.733 --> 20:35.635
Update on our killer?
The vet said we're looking

20:35.668 --> 20:38.871
for a bald, beefy Latino
with a beard like Bluto.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.708
Yeah, Bishop and Dr. Cho
are with the sketch artist now.

20:41.741 --> 20:42.942
We should have an image soon.

20:42.975 --> 20:43.976
Where's McGee?

20:44.010 --> 20:46.313
He is...

20:46.346 --> 20:47.880
playing with his new toy.

20:47.914 --> 20:51.318
McGEE:
This is Alpha 45 Julia 04

20:51.351 --> 20:53.486
calling CQ, CQ, CQ,

20:53.520 --> 20:54.887
seeking Ricochet.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.823
I repeat, seeking Ricochet.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.459
BOY (over radio):
Roger, A45J04.

20:59.492 --> 21:02.061
Is this The Timinator?
Over.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.330
It is. Who is this?

21:03.363 --> 21:07.066
This is Cody B
from Kid Club 17.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.902
Please stay off this frequency.
Thank you.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.070
(signal disconnects)

21:11.103 --> 21:12.739
Ooh, not going
so good, huh?

21:12.772 --> 21:14.574
Special Agent Sloane,
thanks for coming down.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.908
Glad to help.
Looks like you need it.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.511
Hey, breathe.
(inhales)

21:18.545 --> 21:20.347
(inhales)
Yeah, good.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.449
I needed that.
I'm frustrated.

21:22.482 --> 21:23.850
I'm hitting a brick wall
trying to find

21:23.883 --> 21:25.418
our victim's friend
on the radio.

21:25.452 --> 21:27.587
Goes by "Ricochet."
I think he knows something.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.589
And if you can't find him,
what's plan "B"?

21:29.622 --> 21:31.090
It's a technique called
"direction finding."

21:31.123 --> 21:33.993
You use radio waves to
zero in on a location.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.495
There's a way
to block the signal,

21:35.528 --> 21:37.096
but I'm hoping Ricochet
doesn't know how.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.932
Assume he does.
Well, then we've got
plan "C,"

21:39.966 --> 21:42.335
which is comb through
a master list

21:42.369 --> 21:43.836
of all the ham radio
licenses

21:43.870 --> 21:46.506
within an 80-mile radius
of the D.C. area.

21:46.539 --> 21:48.775
632 names, one by one.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.109
Why 80 miles?

21:50.142 --> 21:51.711
Well, that's the range
of the victim's antenna.

21:51.744 --> 21:52.779
Uh-huh.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.381
I know it's kind of weird,

21:54.414 --> 21:55.615
all this equipment
just to talk to people

21:55.648 --> 21:56.849
you can, you know,

21:56.883 --> 21:58.451
talk to in real life.
(chuckles)

21:58.485 --> 22:00.887
No, I-I know a little bit
about it.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.955
Hams are a unique breed.

22:02.989 --> 22:06.359
For some, it's their
only conduit to society.

22:06.393 --> 22:08.428
Yeah, that's sort of why
I asked if you could come down.

22:08.461 --> 22:10.463
I recorded myself
with Ricochet yesterday.

22:10.497 --> 22:11.798
You think I could
play it for you?

22:11.831 --> 22:13.633
Yeah, sure.
Great.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.368
(computer beeps)

22:15.402 --> 22:17.470
RICOCHET (over computer):
This is Ricochet. Who is this?

22:17.504 --> 22:19.472
McGEE (over computer):
Uh, Ricochet, this is NCIS

22:19.506 --> 22:20.973
Special Agent Tim McGee.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.743
Can you give me
your legal name and location?

22:23.776 --> 22:25.412
What are your call letters?
Over.

22:25.445 --> 22:27.447
RICOCHET:
Jaybird is dead, isn't he?

22:27.480 --> 22:28.648
McGEE:
Why would you say that?

22:28.681 --> 22:29.916
RICOCHET:
Last time we talked, he said

22:29.949 --> 22:31.818
he was involved
in something dangerous.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.421
That's it.
I know it's not much, but...

22:34.454 --> 22:37.490
No, no, no, wait.
Hold, please. I got it.

22:38.658 --> 22:41.894
He's 45, chubby,

22:41.928 --> 22:43.162
and lives with his mother.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.163
You can tell all that?

22:44.196 --> 22:46.566
No, I'm kidding.
I can't.

22:46.599 --> 22:47.900
I wish profiling
were that easy.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.101
Hey, is there a way
I can get into

22:49.135 --> 22:50.837
Petty Officer
Miller's apartment?

22:50.870 --> 22:52.405
It's still our crime scene.

22:52.439 --> 22:53.673
Why, what are you looking for?

22:53.706 --> 22:55.442
I don't know yet.

22:58.077 --> 22:58.845
FEMALE VOICE (over phone):
Press seven now.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.847
I already pushed seven.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.449
Here's me pushing it again.

23:02.482 --> 23:04.083
WOMAN:
Press one to repeat the options.

23:04.116 --> 23:05.752
No. Representative.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.420
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.

23:07.454 --> 23:09.188
Rep-re-sen-ta-tive!

23:09.221 --> 23:10.557
I'm sorry, I didn't...

23:10.590 --> 23:11.958
Ugh!

23:14.126 --> 23:15.695
Can I help you?

23:15.728 --> 23:19.131
Yeah, the bagel place denied
my credit card for $1.75.

23:19.165 --> 23:20.433
Why?
I don't know.

23:20.467 --> 23:21.434
I can't seem to get ahold

23:21.468 --> 23:22.602
of my credit card company.

23:22.635 --> 23:24.036
You don't carry at least
$2.00 in cash?

23:24.070 --> 23:26.539
Let's just focus
on the problem here--

23:26.573 --> 23:28.508
I don't have a bagel.

23:28.541 --> 23:30.710
So, here's something.

23:30.743 --> 23:33.045
I just found out
Special Agent Sloane

23:33.079 --> 23:34.481
used to be in the army.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.483
Really?
You're checking up on her?

23:36.516 --> 23:37.450
No.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.152
Yes.

23:40.186 --> 23:41.220
Not just the army.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.489
PsyOps.

23:42.522 --> 23:44.156
Psychological Operations.

23:44.190 --> 23:46.526
They conduct
psychological warfare.

23:46.559 --> 23:48.561
We... we know what
it is, Clay.

23:48.595 --> 23:49.562
You don't think that's weird?

23:49.596 --> 23:50.563
That you're secretly

23:50.597 --> 23:51.564
investigating her?

23:51.598 --> 23:53.165
Yeah, it is.

23:53.199 --> 23:54.634
I have questions.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.569
You have questions, Nick?
I do.

23:56.603 --> 23:58.805
I wonder who she roots for
in the Army-Navy game.

24:05.545 --> 24:07.013
(entry bell chimes)

24:07.046 --> 24:09.616
Talk to me.

24:09.649 --> 24:11.183
I can say for certain

24:11.217 --> 24:14.253
that Petty Officer Miller
died of a broken neck.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.922
You got anything new?

24:15.955 --> 24:18.925
I do. When I examined
Miller's lungs,

24:18.958 --> 24:20.660
they exhibited
pulmonary edema,

24:20.693 --> 24:23.162
a sign he'd been
deprived of oxygen

24:23.195 --> 24:24.631
before he died.

24:24.664 --> 24:25.732
Choked.
Exactly.

24:25.765 --> 24:27.934
I can imagine it's easier
to break someone's neck

24:27.967 --> 24:29.602
if they're unconscious first.

24:29.636 --> 24:31.538
It is.

24:33.540 --> 24:36.576
Oh, uh, Gibbs,
before you leave,

24:36.609 --> 24:38.678
I told Abby I would call her
when you got here.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.781
Hey, Abby.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.783
Jimmy.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.051
Do you have Gibbs with you?
GIBBS: Yeah.

24:45.084 --> 24:46.653
Abbs, I'm right here.

24:46.686 --> 24:48.955
Good. Okay, so I found
something weird

24:48.988 --> 24:51.558
with Petty Officer
Miller-- cocaine.

24:51.591 --> 24:52.859
That's not so weird.

24:52.892 --> 24:54.627
Weird is where I found it.

24:54.661 --> 24:56.863
It was on his clothes,
in his hair.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.297
It was even in his shoes.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.666
In his blood?
No.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.901
His system was
totally clean.

25:01.934 --> 25:06.138
It's like he-he rolled around
in a giant pile of it.

25:06.172 --> 25:08.708
I've never done
cocaine before,

25:08.741 --> 25:11.578
but I think he was
doing it wrong.

25:21.788 --> 25:23.556
Oh, no.

25:23.590 --> 25:27.226
No, no, no, no, no, no.

25:29.128 --> 25:30.329
My credit card's over the limit.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.164
Ooh. Motorcycle?

25:32.198 --> 25:33.566
No, I didn't even
buy it yet.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.234
Huh. Scroll down.

25:37.637 --> 25:39.038
Uh, well,
there's your problem.

25:39.071 --> 25:43.242
A $5,000 charge to...
Inclusion Town? Wow.

25:43.275 --> 25:45.077
That's Jimmy's charity,
but that's not right,

25:45.111 --> 25:46.613
'cause I only gave 50 bucks.

25:46.646 --> 25:47.880
Did you remember
the decimal point?

25:47.914 --> 25:49.582
The what?

25:49.616 --> 25:51.918
Did you type in
50-point-zero-zero,

25:51.951 --> 25:55.154
or five-zero-zero-zero?

25:57.289 --> 25:59.058
Oh, my God.

25:59.091 --> 26:00.593
Are you telling me
I donated

26:00.627 --> 26:02.595
five grand to Jimmy's charity?

26:02.629 --> 26:05.097
Ha, what a guy, Torres.
Update.

26:05.131 --> 26:08.701
Well, Miller and cocaine
don't connect.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.637
By all accounts,
he was a Boy Scout.

26:10.670 --> 26:11.904
And I checked
with his bank.

26:11.938 --> 26:14.106
He had less than
$2,000 in savings.

26:14.140 --> 26:16.609
And why work two jobs
if you're a drug dealer?
It's a good cover.

26:16.643 --> 26:18.945
Criminal mastermind
selling coke on the radio?

26:18.978 --> 26:20.913
Mm, too risky.
Frequencies are open lines.

26:20.947 --> 26:21.948
Anyone can listen in.

26:21.981 --> 26:23.115
I went back to his apartment.

26:23.149 --> 26:25.652
No drugs, no paraphernalia,

26:25.685 --> 26:28.755
but what I did find was
Agent Sloane snooping around.

26:28.788 --> 26:31.123
Bagging evidence.

26:31.157 --> 26:33.259
The sketch of our suspect
from the vet?
Done.

26:33.292 --> 26:35.361
Torres has it.

26:36.996 --> 26:39.932
Uh, yeah, right here.

26:39.966 --> 26:41.768
No ID on the guy,
but Abby's running

26:41.801 --> 26:44.236
facial recognition.

26:44.270 --> 26:47.306
Who is that, Ricochet?
Uh...

26:47.339 --> 26:49.642
don't know yet,
McGee's still looking for him.

26:49.676 --> 26:50.943
(radio static)
Okay, I'm done looking.

26:50.977 --> 26:53.646
(sighs) I have tried
every trick I know,

26:53.680 --> 26:55.314
and he blocks me
at every turn.

26:55.347 --> 26:58.317
You win, Ricochet.

26:58.350 --> 27:00.653
How many people
signed your yearbook?

27:00.687 --> 27:03.790
I really don't feel like
reminiscing right now.

27:03.823 --> 27:06.158
That's not where
I was going with you, sorry.

27:06.192 --> 27:07.694
I found Miller's
high school yearbook

27:07.727 --> 27:08.961
at the apartment.

27:08.995 --> 27:10.062
Come take a look at this.

27:13.365 --> 27:15.167
McGEE:
Only three signatures.

27:15.201 --> 27:16.669
King of an unpopular kid.

27:16.703 --> 27:19.638
More than unpopular.
Almost invisible.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.942
Think about Miller, okay?

27:22.975 --> 27:25.678
Quiet, shy...

27:25.712 --> 27:27.179
As a quartermaster
in the navy

27:27.213 --> 27:28.347
and a groundskeeper
on the golf course,

27:28.380 --> 27:29.348
he worked alone.

27:29.381 --> 27:32.685
And he took anxiety medication,

27:32.719 --> 27:34.020
probably just to
get through the day.

27:34.053 --> 27:36.723
And don't forget about
the birthmark.

27:36.756 --> 27:38.725
The one on his face?
I barely noticed that.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.292
Don't dismiss it.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.795
When you're a child and
different, kids can be cruel.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.363
Some people never
get over it.

27:44.396 --> 27:48.167
The radio was his salvation.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.703
He could let his guard down,
become a different person.

27:50.737 --> 27:53.806
He was confident, gregarious,

27:53.840 --> 27:55.374
anonymous.

27:55.407 --> 27:57.209
He got to use
his best asset--

27:57.243 --> 27:58.711
his voice.

27:58.745 --> 28:00.146
Listen to his outgoing message.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.881
MILLER'S VOICE (enthusiastic):
Hello, hello!

28:01.914 --> 28:03.883
You've reached Jake
"Jaybird" Miller

28:03.916 --> 28:06.485
of A45J04.

28:06.518 --> 28:09.055
Leave a message, and until then,
see you on the radio.

28:09.088 --> 28:11.858
Wow. Same guy,
different person.

28:11.891 --> 28:14.193
Exactly.
Wait a minute.

28:15.928 --> 28:18.731
Jake used the name
Jaybird on the radio.

28:18.765 --> 28:21.200
My handle was
The Timinator.

28:21.233 --> 28:22.334
Awesome, I know.

28:22.368 --> 28:25.171
Now, what if Ricochet

28:25.204 --> 28:26.839
is a play on his real name?

28:26.873 --> 28:27.774
Same but different?

28:31.110 --> 28:32.745
Ah...

28:32.779 --> 28:35.782
SLOANE:
Rick O. Shea.

28:35.815 --> 28:37.383
Let's see, Virginia address.

28:37.416 --> 28:39.418
Four miles from
Petty Officer Miller's.

28:39.451 --> 28:40.753
Nice work.
Wanna come?

28:40.787 --> 28:42.989
You betcha.

28:50.296 --> 28:52.799
There he is.
Get over here.

28:52.832 --> 28:54.767
Let's save the hugs.
What's the matter?

28:54.801 --> 28:56.235
(clears throat)

28:56.268 --> 28:59.271
Okay, um...

28:59.305 --> 29:01.107
it's your charity.

29:01.140 --> 29:04.944
I'm sorry, there's been
a big mistake.

29:06.578 --> 29:07.914
I over-donated.

29:07.947 --> 29:09.381
Oh.

29:09.415 --> 29:11.818
I-I was gonna
maybe say something,

29:11.851 --> 29:14.954
but I thought maybe
you'd been inspired.

29:14.987 --> 29:17.456
Yeah, nobody's ever
that inspired.
It's okay.

29:17.489 --> 29:19.892
It's okay. Uh, how much
of the 5,000 do you want back?

29:19.926 --> 29:21.493
$4,950.

29:23.495 --> 29:24.964
Mm-hmm.

29:24.997 --> 29:26.298
Oh, come on, Jimmy,
don't make this

29:26.332 --> 29:28.467
more awkward than
it already is, man.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.302
No, no, I mean,
I-I should have said something.

29:30.336 --> 29:31.470
It's-it's fine. Uh...

29:31.503 --> 29:33.272
five grand is a lot of money.

29:33.305 --> 29:34.406
Yeah, it's a lot of money.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.075
I mean, enough to buy
a Supermoto.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.477
Mm.

29:38.510 --> 29:40.813
Hey, I just...

29:40.847 --> 29:42.815
I've been saving
for a year.

29:42.849 --> 29:44.917
Yeah.

29:44.951 --> 29:46.986
It's just an honest
mistake, man.

29:47.019 --> 29:50.089
Yeah. You're right.

29:50.122 --> 29:53.325
You're right.

29:55.361 --> 29:57.329
Hey, Jimmy...

29:57.363 --> 29:59.565
I-I should do it in person.

30:02.902 --> 30:04.136
(knocking)

30:04.170 --> 30:06.505
(dog barking)
RICOCHET: Who is it?

30:06.538 --> 30:07.874
Mr. Shea?

30:07.907 --> 30:09.942
NCIS Special Agent
Tim McGee.

30:09.976 --> 30:11.878
We spoke on the
radio yesterday.

30:11.911 --> 30:14.813
(dog barking)

30:16.916 --> 30:18.584
Sir, it's vital that
we talk to you.

30:20.586 --> 30:23.189
RICOCHET: I've got to put
some clothes on.

30:25.024 --> 30:27.126
There's a reason why
stereotypes exist, McGee.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.862
Yeah, well, this guy has
no driver's license,

30:29.896 --> 30:31.964
no home phone,
no cell phone,

30:31.998 --> 30:34.033
no reportable income
since 2007.

30:34.066 --> 30:36.002
So I think this guy's
gonna be exactly

30:36.035 --> 30:38.204
who you picture when you
think of ham radio weirdo.

30:38.237 --> 30:39.638
Got it.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.373
Bet you he doesn't
open the door?

30:41.407 --> 30:43.876
Hmm. Well...

30:43.910 --> 30:45.644
Oh.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.313
I was wrong.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.882
RICOCHET:
You so stipulate that

30:49.916 --> 30:52.885
all words and actions
will be recorded

30:52.919 --> 30:57.056
and uploaded live
onto a secure server.

30:57.089 --> 30:58.157
No problem.
Understood.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.059
And any illegal
search and seizure

31:00.092 --> 31:02.228
will be documented
and recorded.

31:02.261 --> 31:04.196
We're just gonna ask you
a few questions.

31:04.230 --> 31:06.332
"No person shall be held
to answer

31:06.365 --> 31:09.068
"for a capital or otherwise

31:09.101 --> 31:10.236
infamous crime."

31:10.269 --> 31:11.403
Mr. Shea, you don't need
to recite

31:11.437 --> 31:13.005
the Fifth Amendment.

31:13.039 --> 31:14.340
"...unless on a presentment

31:14.373 --> 31:16.909
of an indictment
of a grand jury."

31:16.943 --> 31:19.045
Ricochet. Hey,
buddy, listen.
Yeah.

31:19.078 --> 31:20.947
It's okay, all right?

31:20.980 --> 31:21.813
Yeah.
I know it's scary

31:21.847 --> 31:23.682
to have federal agents
in your house.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.351
Yes.
Everything's okay.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.086
(dog barking)

31:27.119 --> 31:29.088
All right, is your dog okay?
He's just very curious.

31:29.121 --> 31:32.524
Um, I don't get many visitors.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.260
Are either of you allergic?

31:34.293 --> 31:35.527
No.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.396
It's very kind of you to ask.

31:37.429 --> 31:38.931
Thank you.

31:38.965 --> 31:40.399
I love dogs.

31:40.432 --> 31:42.101
Yeah.
Could I meet him?

31:42.134 --> 31:44.036
Yes.
Great.

31:44.070 --> 31:46.973
(quietly): I'm really
not that into dogs.

31:47.006 --> 31:48.240
Here, Benji.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.042
McGEE:
Benji?

31:50.076 --> 31:51.377
I know this dog.
I met him yesterday

31:51.410 --> 31:52.979
at Petty Officer Miller's house.

31:53.012 --> 31:53.980
We use the same dog walker.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.081
He was jumping
out of his skin

31:55.114 --> 31:56.949
to get to me.
Now he seems just fine.

31:56.983 --> 31:58.250
He did that to you, too?

31:58.284 --> 32:00.086
Yeah. Who else
did he do that to?

32:00.119 --> 32:00.987
Jaybird.

32:01.020 --> 32:02.721
Petty Officer Miller.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.290
Yeah, it's the strangest thing.

32:04.323 --> 32:06.625
He's, uh, usually
very well-behaved.

32:06.658 --> 32:09.061
Wait, is that what you and
Miller were talking about

32:09.095 --> 32:10.596
on the radio the night
before he was killed?

32:10.629 --> 32:12.431
Yeah.

32:12.464 --> 32:14.000
Where did you get Benji?

32:14.033 --> 32:16.135
I adopted him
after he retired from the TSA.

32:16.168 --> 32:19.205
A canine agent?

32:20.272 --> 32:21.440
A drug dog.

32:21.473 --> 32:23.075
McGEE:
Ricochet?

32:23.109 --> 32:24.743
I'm gonna need to borrow Benji.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.278
Um...

32:26.312 --> 32:27.446
It'll be okay.

32:30.216 --> 32:31.984
(barking)

32:32.018 --> 32:35.121
Hey, boss, you know that pile of
cocaine Abby was talking about?

32:35.154 --> 32:37.056
I found it.

32:49.368 --> 32:52.138
So, this sediment was taken
directly from the bunker.

32:52.171 --> 32:55.041
Looks like just
plain old sand, right?

32:55.074 --> 32:56.008
Wrong.

32:56.042 --> 32:59.045
Mixed in is pure-grade cocaine.

32:59.078 --> 33:00.479
And you're gonna help me
separate it out.

33:00.512 --> 33:02.281
Hmm. With colanders?

33:02.314 --> 33:04.283
Actually, it's a sieve.

33:04.316 --> 33:09.188
"Colanders drain,
and sieves strain."

33:09.221 --> 33:10.489
HGTV.

33:10.522 --> 33:12.024
(clears throat)
ABBY:
Okay.

33:12.058 --> 33:13.525
Well, Martha Stewart,
you're gonna end up

33:13.559 --> 33:14.693
with the final product.

33:14.726 --> 33:16.295
All we have to do

33:16.328 --> 33:21.067
is progressively strain out
finer and finer particles.

33:21.100 --> 33:22.501
BISHOP: It's basic
separation science.

33:22.534 --> 33:24.136
Well, I don't know.
Turning sand into cocaine

33:24.170 --> 33:26.072
seems more like magic to me.

33:26.105 --> 33:27.373
ABBY: I mean, there's
more sophisticated ways

33:27.406 --> 33:30.542
to separate out cocaine,
but this will do the job.

33:30.576 --> 33:32.711
All right, Bishop.
Shake your money maker.

33:32.744 --> 33:35.347
McGEE: I have seen Abby extract
trace amounts of mercury

33:35.381 --> 33:37.549
from nanometer-sized
cerium oxide particles,

33:37.583 --> 33:39.518
so this should be easy.

33:39.551 --> 33:41.487
I'll bet Delilah can't
keep her hands off you

33:41.520 --> 33:43.222
when she hears you
talk like that.

33:43.255 --> 33:45.224
Actually...
Oh, come on.

33:45.257 --> 33:47.726
Mm, it's like
I'm prospecting for gold.

33:55.134 --> 33:57.069
TORRES:
Yeah. White gold.

33:58.637 --> 33:59.838
Enough to kill for.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.073
We got our motive.

34:01.107 --> 34:02.174
(computer beeping)

34:02.208 --> 34:03.509
And we've got our suspect.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.744
I ran facial recognition

34:05.777 --> 34:08.680
on all the employees for the
golf club's landscaping company.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.116
(typing)

34:10.149 --> 34:11.217
That's our match.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.255
His name is Ramon Moncada.

34:16.288 --> 34:17.689
He's a delivery guy

34:17.723 --> 34:18.690
at the Southeast
Sand and Turf.

34:18.724 --> 34:19.691
Same place

34:19.725 --> 34:22.094
that kept calling Miller
the day before he died.

34:22.128 --> 34:23.562
Pick him up.
McGee and Torres

34:23.595 --> 34:25.564
are out looking for him now.
Next cell call he makes,

34:25.597 --> 34:26.565
they got him.
Where's he get his coke?

34:26.598 --> 34:27.733
Well, we think

34:27.766 --> 34:30.602
it's being smuggled in
from Mexico.

34:30.636 --> 34:32.738
Southeast Sand and Turf
get their sand

34:32.771 --> 34:34.106
from a quarry
outside of Nogales,

34:34.140 --> 34:36.108
so it's not hard to imagine

34:36.142 --> 34:38.244
someone lacing the sand
with coke,

34:38.277 --> 34:41.447
shipping it across the border
to Southeast's warehouse,

34:41.480 --> 34:44.116
where it's separated and sold.

34:44.150 --> 34:46.118
Oh. But somebody screwed up.

34:46.152 --> 34:48.554
Yeah. Seems a bag of coke sand

34:48.587 --> 34:50.389
ended up on
Miller's golf course

34:50.422 --> 34:51.423
instead of the street.

34:51.457 --> 34:52.624
Which is probably

34:52.658 --> 34:55.294
why Moncada kept calling Miller.

34:55.327 --> 34:56.895
He needed his drugs back.

34:56.928 --> 34:59.898
But then, Ricochet's
drug-sniffing dog

34:59.931 --> 35:01.633
clued Miller in
to what was going on.

35:01.667 --> 35:04.570
That dog did the same thing
to McGee.

35:04.603 --> 35:05.737
Miller became
The Man Who Knew Too Much

35:05.771 --> 35:07.273
and Moncada took him out.

35:07.306 --> 35:08.474
(phone ringing)

35:08.507 --> 35:09.675
Yeah, Torres?

35:10.809 --> 35:12.144
Bring him in.

35:12.178 --> 35:13.779
We got our guy.

35:13.812 --> 35:16.615
He's at a bus station, with
a one-way ticket to Toronto.

35:16.648 --> 35:20.319
Hmm. Headed far away
from Mexico.

35:20.352 --> 35:22.488
(camera shutter clicking)

35:22.521 --> 35:24.490
TORRES: So you're saying
this is not you, Moncada?

35:24.523 --> 35:26.658
McGEE: We've got you dead
to rights for the murder.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.327
Your blood
is on the victim's shirt,

35:28.360 --> 35:31.163
and the teeth of the rake
he used to defend himself.

35:31.197 --> 35:36.168
The veterinarian that stitched
you up made a positive ID.

35:36.202 --> 35:37.603
That's your rap sheet.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.271
You haven't been
a very good boy.

35:39.305 --> 35:41.673
And with murder and
drug smuggling, well,

35:41.707 --> 35:43.209
that's gonna be a short trial.

35:45.344 --> 35:46.312
Hey.

35:46.345 --> 35:47.279
Do yourself a favor.

35:47.313 --> 35:48.680
Cooperate.

35:48.714 --> 35:50.682
You tell us who else
is involved,

35:50.716 --> 35:53.185
we might be able to make
that 25 years to life

35:53.219 --> 35:54.186
a little more comfortable.

35:54.220 --> 35:58.224
If I talk, they'll kill me.

35:58.257 --> 35:59.225
Who are "they"?

36:00.892 --> 36:02.861
I won't be safe anywhere.

36:02.894 --> 36:04.696
Especially in prison.

36:04.730 --> 36:07.666
I assume you're talking
Mexican cartel?

36:07.699 --> 36:11.337
He's definitely
not management.

36:11.370 --> 36:13.505
He's probably just a worker and
muscle for when they need it.

36:13.539 --> 36:15.374
Well, he's right
about one thing.

36:15.407 --> 36:18.310
If he does talk,
he won't last long in prison.

36:18.344 --> 36:20.312
RAMON:
You can't protect me.
Mm.

36:30.722 --> 36:32.358
La jefa.

36:32.391 --> 36:34.326
Evelyn Gomez.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.895
She's the owner of
Southeast Sand and Turf.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.364
She takes orders
from someone

36:38.397 --> 36:40.266
in Mexico she calls El Gato.

36:40.299 --> 36:41.500
That's all I know.

36:41.533 --> 36:44.970
He'll send somebody to kill us.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.342
She'll never talk.

36:50.376 --> 36:52.278
She's as scared of this
El Gato guy as he is.

36:52.311 --> 36:53.345
So we use

36:53.379 --> 36:54.380
that fear against her.

36:54.413 --> 36:55.581
Ah.

36:55.614 --> 36:57.383
Why just settle
for the little fish?

36:58.950 --> 37:00.886
(Spanish hip-hop song playing)

37:21.907 --> 37:24.242
TORRES:
Hola, Evelyn.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.288
Gato?

37:47.833 --> 37:49.468
Because you
were careless.

37:49.501 --> 37:51.970
Now you have to pay the price.

37:52.003 --> 37:56.308
Please. Please don't kill me.

37:56.342 --> 37:57.809
Give me another chance.

37:57.843 --> 37:59.311
Ooh, I don't give those.

37:59.345 --> 38:01.313
Only El Gato can do that.

38:01.347 --> 38:03.749
(crying)
Call him.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.484
Beg for your life.

38:06.685 --> 38:07.919
(beeping)

38:07.953 --> 38:10.589
(phone ringing)

38:10.622 --> 38:11.757
EL GATO:
Yes?

38:11.790 --> 38:13.625
It's Evelyn.

38:20.666 --> 38:21.933
(crying)

38:21.967 --> 38:24.069
Pineapple.

38:25.371 --> 38:26.838
Oh, NCIS. You're under arrest.

38:26.872 --> 38:27.873
(gasps)

38:30.676 --> 38:31.977
We got El Gato's number.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.545
I'll trace the location.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.883
(handcuffs clicking)

38:48.394 --> 38:49.695
Butterfly?

38:50.929 --> 38:51.997
Oh, come on, Gibbs,

38:52.030 --> 38:53.499
you can do better than that.

38:53.532 --> 38:54.700
Big moth?

38:54.733 --> 38:56.702
That's better.

38:59.004 --> 39:00.406
Need a level?

39:00.439 --> 39:03.041
No, thanks.

39:03.074 --> 39:04.510
What?

39:04.543 --> 39:05.411
Crooked.

39:05.444 --> 39:07.379
It's close enough.

39:07.413 --> 39:09.881
I'm hanging a picture, not
building a boat in my basement.

39:09.915 --> 39:11.717
Your office.

39:11.750 --> 39:16.522
One that I hope to finish
moving into soon.

39:17.756 --> 39:19.157
Ah, red.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.393
We tracked El Gato.

39:21.427 --> 39:23.061
Suarez Cartel.

39:23.094 --> 39:24.563
DEA's got him now.

39:24.596 --> 39:27.399
Ah. So we nailed a killer

39:27.433 --> 39:29.701
and shut down
a major cocaine pipeline.

39:29.735 --> 39:31.903
Not a bad couple of days, Gibbs.

39:31.937 --> 39:33.672
You worked well with the team.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.140
Most of them.

39:37.776 --> 39:39.044
Ladybug.

39:41.647 --> 39:43.582
You're really not
very good at this, are you?

39:46.952 --> 39:48.654
(children clamoring)

40:03.769 --> 40:04.936
BOY:
Whoa!

40:04.970 --> 40:06.071
(laughter)
It's okay.

40:06.104 --> 40:07.439
That's a good one.

40:07.473 --> 40:09.708
That was good.
That was an excellent slide.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.477
I'll see you later. Go that way.
Hey, Nick.

40:12.978 --> 40:14.946
Hey, uh, I want you
to meet the founder,

40:14.980 --> 40:16.615
Catherine Scott.

40:16.648 --> 40:18.116
It is so great
to meet you, Nick.

40:18.149 --> 40:20.519
Oh, you, too.

40:21.953 --> 40:24.723
Well, this place is...

40:24.756 --> 40:26.725
it's incredible.
CATHERINE:
Thank you.

40:26.758 --> 40:29.628
We do our best.
Yeah, that was my
first reaction, too.

40:29.661 --> 40:31.497
I never knew that kids
with disabilities

40:31.530 --> 40:34.600
never got to actually play
at your typical playground.

40:34.633 --> 40:37.636
And here, they can just be kids.

40:37.669 --> 40:38.904
CATHERINE:
Uh, so, Nick.

40:38.937 --> 40:41.507
Jimmy said that you wanted to
talk to me about your donation.

40:43.041 --> 40:45.477
Oh, I... I do?
JIMMY:
Yeah.

40:45.511 --> 40:48.146
About the mix-up? You
know, with the amount,

40:48.179 --> 40:50.516
and your credit card.
CATHERINE:
Oh.

40:50.549 --> 40:51.817
Oh. If there was a mistake,
don't worry.

40:51.850 --> 40:53.552
We can refund
your credit card right away.

41:02.561 --> 41:05.597
Um, no mistake, no.

41:05.631 --> 41:06.765
We're good.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.534
(gasps)

41:08.567 --> 41:10.569
Okay.

41:16.875 --> 41:19.511
No dirt bike?

41:19.545 --> 41:21.513
Next year.

41:25.617 --> 41:27.853
All right. The-the hugging
thing, really...

41:27.886 --> 41:29.721
(laughs)
