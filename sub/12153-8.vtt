I want Darla to see William.

nothing but women as travel companions?

Don't mistake me.
I do love the ladies.

02:08.900 --> 02:11.900

of innocents with another man.

At least give me Wesley's

- I don't know what to figure yet.
<i>- Angel.</i>

08:53.900 --> 08:56.100
Oh, let me guess. The lab

08:56.100 --> 08:58.200
Well, yeah, but that's just
the tip of the fritzberg.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.600
The needles on our atmospheric
gauges started spiking into red.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.600
Totally blew out
the instruments.

09:02.600 --> 09:05.200
Like some kind of electrical surge,
like what's affecting our phones and--

09:05.200 --> 09:08.400
Well, yeah. That's what I thought at first,
but I think it might be something else.

09:17.300 --> 09:19.200
She's what?

09:19.200 --> 09:21.600
You know, nooner. When you
have sex in the middle--

09:21.600 --> 09:25.400
I know what a nooner is, Charles.
You said she's with Spike?

09:25.400 --> 09:27.900
- Uh, yeah. He's corporeal again.
- Corporeal?

09:27.900 --> 09:31.500
Yeah. He got something in the mail. Flash,
bam, boom-- he's a solid citizen again.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.400
Oh, my God!
Why didn't you call me?

09:33.400 --> 09:35.700
I'm sorry. We just--you know,
we've had our hands full...

09:35.700 --> 09:38.400
dealing with the glitch
in the office system...

09:38.400 --> 09:41.200
which just so happens to coincide
with Spike being back...

09:41.200 --> 09:43.200
and I can't believe
I'm just getting that.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.100
You think whatever recorporealized
Spike's doin' a number on the building?

09:46.100 --> 09:48.900
Obviously they're connected.
Maybe when Spike's matter...

09:48.900 --> 09:50.900
was reintegrated
into physical form...

09:50.900 --> 09:54.000
it had some sort of ripple
effect on the immediate environment.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.500
Or if those gauge readings are correct, it
could be the start of something bigger, like--

09:58.500 --> 10:01.200
<i>The entire universe thrown</i>
<i>into catastrophic turmoil?</i>

10:01.200 --> 10:03.500
'Cause that's
what's happening, kids.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.700
So you know
what's going on?

10:05.700 --> 10:09.500
Only what I'm told, counselor.
Corporate seers alerted me to the situation.

10:09.800 --> 10:12.600
- Which is?
- It's a harbinger.

10:12.600 --> 10:16.600
- Harbinger?
- Upshot is we've got trouble with a capital ''T''...

10:16.600 --> 10:19.100
and that rhymes with ''P,''
and that stands for ''prophecy.''

10:19.100 --> 10:21.400
Shanshu.
Maybe you've heard of it?

10:21.400 --> 10:25.100
Oh, God. That again, yeah.
I'm familiar. So?

10:25.100 --> 10:28.500
So it talks about a champion--
a vampire with a soul...

10:28.500 --> 10:31.800
who will play a pivotal role
in the apocalypse... for good or evil.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.500
Anybody's guess.
That part's hazy.

10:34.500 --> 10:37.700
I thought the Shanshu had to do with
Angel becoming human again after--

10:37.700 --> 10:40.600
That's just the epilogue, princess.

10:40.600 --> 10:43.900
And for the record, the prophecy
doesn't call Angel by name.

10:43.900 --> 10:46.600
<i>Hold on. You're sayin'because</i>
<i>Spike's back,you think he's--</i>

10:46.600 --> 10:49.600
I don't think anything.
All I can tell you...

10:49.600 --> 10:52.500
is his very existence is
disrupting the order of things.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.400
No argument here.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.300
There were already two souled vampires
in the universe before Spike fried.

10:57.300 --> 11:00.200
<i>- Why is this happening now?</i>
- Key word here is ''champion.''

11:00.200 --> 11:04.000
Spike gave his life to save the world.
That gives him the cred.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.300
But when he died and
became a ghost, case closed.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.500
Now that he's back,
all bets are off, kids.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.500
- Where are you going?
- To check on something.

11:18.500 --> 11:23.400
You knew this would happen. All that time
I was working on recorporealizing Spike...

11:23.400 --> 11:27.000

who sent it.

was split in two...

We don't want to be wrong about this.

There is no wrong. The drinking
