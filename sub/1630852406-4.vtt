DO NOT DISCRIMINATE
DISTRIBUTE FAIRLY

00:30.321 --> 00:32.949
Please take part
in the abolition of the classification.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.492
We need your signature, sir.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.502
We need your signature.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.088
We need your signature.

00:47.672 --> 00:48.757
Thank you.

01:05.857 --> 01:10.153
<i>This is an announcement for all patients</i>
<i>of the Third National Medical Center.</i>

01:10.862 --> 01:14.824
<i>The Third National Medical Center</i>
<i>promises to provide</i>

01:14.908 --> 01:18.745
<i>the best care in order for you</i>

01:18.828 --> 01:23.083
<i>If you have any questions</i>

01:23.166 --> 01:27.587
You'll need a higher water classification
to stop her condition from worsening.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.006
If her condition worsens,

01:31.007 --> 01:32.801
she may lose her legs forever.

01:34.844 --> 01:37.097
There isn't much we can do

01:38.181 --> 01:40.975
with the class you currently hold.

03:23.620 --> 03:27.916
THE TRUTH COMES OUT

03:28.416 --> 03:29.667
That's water.

03:30.668 --> 03:31.544
It's water.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.922
It's ordinary, yet it's unusual.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.885
What's ordinary about it
and what's unusual?

03:38.968 --> 03:40.595
Its solubility, surface tension,

03:40.678 --> 03:42.722
and other characteristics are like water.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.933
But the mass and the density aren't.

03:45.016 --> 03:48.353
There was no microorganism found,
so it's closer to distilled water.

03:49.103 --> 03:52.106
Yet it's bigger in atomic weight
like heavy water.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.524
But it's not heavy water.

03:53.608 --> 03:56.152
It froze at a temperature
much lower than water.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.238
It froze at about
minus 80 degrees Celsius.

03:58.321 --> 04:00.657
It became less active
as the temperature dropped.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.910
But it's still water.

04:05.036 --> 04:09.999
BALHAE LUNAR RESEARCH STATION

05:15.398 --> 05:17.650
I'm way too frightened to watch this.

05:19.527 --> 05:21.404
Make sure your anchor is rock solid.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.031
It'll be over if you slip.

05:26.993 --> 05:29.912
<i>Once you're there,</i>
<i>you'll see the power to the mechanism.</i>

05:29.996 --> 05:33.124
Once you turn that off,
I'll begin revising the protocol.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.710
You can replace the panel while I do that,

05:35.793 --> 05:37.170
<i>and once I give you a sign…</i>

05:42.633 --> 05:43.634
Hey.

05:44.260 --> 05:45.261
What's happening?

05:50.350 --> 05:51.184
That's…

05:51.267 --> 05:53.603
-Try to do whatever it takes to stop it.
-I'm trying.

05:58.274 --> 06:00.401
What? Why's the elevator moving?

06:00.985 --> 06:02.487
It's completely out of control.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.072
Captain, you have to avoid it.

06:10.661 --> 06:12.246
Put the emergency brake on.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.247
Yes, sir.

06:22.298 --> 06:23.800
The emergency brake is down too.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.595
Captain, you need to move!

06:27.678 --> 06:28.679
Wait, no!

06:31.099 --> 06:33.226
-You need to move, sir!
<i>-Captain!</i>

06:42.110 --> 06:43.736
<i>Captain. Are you okay?</i>

07:02.880 --> 07:03.881
What?

07:05.508 --> 07:06.342
What's going on?

07:12.432 --> 07:13.766
Is it working now?

07:13.850 --> 07:15.143
I think so.

07:20.148 --> 07:20.982
Captain.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.192
I'm fine.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.653
What happened?

07:25.736 --> 07:27.363
<i>I'm not sure, Captain.</i>

07:27.447 --> 07:29.740
<i>It may be malfunctioning</i>
<i>due to the unstable power.</i>

07:29.824 --> 07:32.952
<i>I thought the elevator wasn't working.</i>
<i>Why would it suddenly do that?</i>

07:33.703 --> 07:35.329
<i>Captain. Are you okay?</i>

07:35.413 --> 07:37.290
I'll go to you, Captain.

07:37.373 --> 07:38.541
Drop the rope.

08:07.820 --> 08:08.905
Throw the rope.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.407
<i>-Pardon, Captain?</i>
-Throw the whole thing down!

08:11.491 --> 08:13.284
<i>What's going on? Captain?</i>

08:16.120 --> 08:17.038
<i>What?</i>

08:19.373 --> 08:20.666
<i>Captain!</i>

08:20.750 --> 08:22.210
<i>-Captain!</i>
<i>-Captain!</i>

08:22.293 --> 08:23.753
<i>-Sir!</i>
<i>-No!</i>

09:00.706 --> 09:02.708
<i>-Damage detected in the oxygen system.</i>
<i>-Captain.</i>

09:02.792 --> 09:05.378
<i>-Can you hear me, sir?</i>
<i>-Damage detected in the oxygen system.</i>

09:10.007 --> 09:10.967
<i>Sir!</i>

09:12.677 --> 09:13.803
<i>Sir?</i>

09:14.762 --> 09:16.847
<i>Captain! Are you okay?</i>

09:20.017 --> 09:21.727
<i>You have to come to your senses!</i>

09:22.228 --> 09:24.188
<i>Answer us, Captain!</i>

10:10.484 --> 10:11.527
<i>Captain!</i>

10:14.780 --> 10:16.949
<i>Are you okay, sir?</i>

10:17.742 --> 10:18.576
I'm fine.

10:18.659 --> 10:20.703
<i>What a relief, sir.</i>

10:21.203 --> 10:23.581
<i>I was worried something</i>
<i>might have happened to you.</i>

10:24.749 --> 10:26.292
I'll finish up and return.

10:37.428 --> 10:41.432
<i>Oxygen level at nine percent.</i>
<i>Impairment to thermoregulatory control.</i>

10:41.515 --> 10:42.391
<i>Captain,</i>

10:42.475 --> 10:44.060
you can't proceed any further.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.479
You'd better return.

10:54.278 --> 10:55.446
I'm okay.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.250
<i>Damage detected in the oxygen system.</i>

11:10.961 --> 11:13.172
<i>Damage detected in the oxygen system.</i>

11:16.967 --> 11:19.178
I found it. What's next?

11:20.429 --> 11:22.807
<i>Pull down the bottom lever</i>
<i>to replace the device,</i>

11:22.890 --> 11:25.226
<i>then turn off the power switch</i>
<i>on the upper right.</i>

11:34.527 --> 11:36.821
<i>Signal detected. Revising the protocol.</i>

11:36.904 --> 11:37.947
Rebooting.

11:40.825 --> 11:44.078
<i>One minute until the system reboots.</i>
<i>Please replace the panel.</i>

11:44.578 --> 11:46.872
It's the second panel from the left.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.054
<i>Damage detected in the oxygen system.</i>

12:04.807 --> 12:07.017
<i>Damage detected in the oxygen system.</i>

12:09.854 --> 12:12.106
<i>Damage detected in the oxygen system.</i>

12:30.916 --> 12:32.460
Panel replaced.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.879
Thirty seconds until the system reboots.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.382
But of all elevators,

12:38.466 --> 12:41.469
why on earth
did the elevator in that shaft move?

12:41.552 --> 12:44.722
Exactly. I can't control it
or spot the error.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.183
This place has bad feng shui.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.435
Things went haywire from the start.

12:49.518 --> 12:52.354
<i>Connect life support system immediately.</i>

12:53.397 --> 12:55.775
<i>Connect life support system immediately.</i>

12:55.858 --> 12:57.818
<i>You need to come back right now, sir.</i>

12:58.819 --> 12:59.945
<i>System rebooted.</i>

13:00.446 --> 13:02.198
Turn on the switch and lever
in reverse order.

13:02.281 --> 13:05.326
<i>Connect life support system immediately.</i>

13:05.409 --> 13:06.243
<i>Sir.</i>

13:07.495 --> 13:09.914
<i>You have to come back. Can you make it?</i>

13:10.831 --> 13:13.667
<i>Connect life support system immediately.</i>

13:18.297 --> 13:21.050
<i>You need to come up now, sir.</i>

13:23.052 --> 13:25.846
<i>Connect life support system immediately.</i>

13:33.479 --> 13:36.440
<i>Connect life support system immediately.</i>

13:38.275 --> 13:39.360
<i>-Captain.</i>
<i>-Captain!</i>

13:39.443 --> 13:41.278
<i>-Sir!</i>
<i>-Are you all right?</i>

13:41.362 --> 13:42.738
<i>Oh, no.</i>

13:43.489 --> 13:44.365
<i>Chief Gong!</i>

13:44.448 --> 13:45.282
<i>Captain!</i>

13:45.366 --> 13:46.992
<i>Do you see the Captain, Chief Gong?</i>

13:47.076 --> 13:47.993
<i>Captain!</i>

13:48.702 --> 13:49.537
<i>Sir!</i>

13:50.788 --> 13:54.458
Even if its molecular structure is
different from Earth's water, it's water.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.961
And we saw obvious signs
of drowning in the bodies.

13:57.044 --> 14:00.381
But how was that much water
stored in his body?

14:00.464 --> 14:01.340
Exactly.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.760
At first, I thought
it could be secondary drowning.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.428
But think of Soochan. No way.

14:06.512 --> 14:07.638
Secondary drowning?

14:07.721 --> 14:09.807
There are different types of drowning?

14:09.890 --> 14:11.517
The water that gets into your lungs

14:11.600 --> 14:14.937
can cause pulmonary edema, brain damage,
respiratory distress, and more.

14:15.020 --> 14:18.023
It's when you get water in your lungs,
but you don't realize it.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.191
It causes death later.

14:19.275 --> 14:23.445
Does that mean you drown
because of the water in your body?

14:24.238 --> 14:25.656
How long does it take

14:26.282 --> 14:28.200
for secondary drowning to show symptoms?

14:28.284 --> 14:29.910
It differs by case.

14:29.994 --> 14:31.912
It could show in under an hour.

14:31.996 --> 14:35.833
At times, people collapse
in a day or two with difficulty breathing.

14:37.334 --> 14:40.045
But the amount of water Soochan threw up…

14:40.129 --> 14:44.341
Yes, it's way too much
to say it was all in his lungs.

14:44.425 --> 14:47.553
How can the amount of water
in his body explode in quantity

14:47.636 --> 14:50.514
and infiltrate his throat and lungs?
That's impossible.

14:50.598 --> 14:51.765
But the water

14:53.350 --> 14:55.811
did not increase in quantity
after his death.

14:59.356 --> 15:00.190
So?

15:01.191 --> 15:04.320
It multiplies rapidly
once the host is infected,

15:04.403 --> 15:08.073
then it stops its activity
when the host dies.

15:17.499 --> 15:19.919
Are you saying this water is a virus?

15:27.051 --> 15:27.927
Captain.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.431
Captain, are you all right?

15:40.147 --> 15:41.398
What happened?

15:41.482 --> 15:43.609
You lost consciousness
due to lack of oxygen.

15:44.401 --> 15:46.820
Why don't you stop by the infirmary first?

15:47.947 --> 15:48.822
I'm fine.

16:18.185 --> 16:20.020
-And the comms?
-We're trying.

16:36.453 --> 16:41.375
Are those all types of viruses and germs?

16:42.209 --> 16:43.627
Nothing matches.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.089
I'm sure he was infected by something.

16:49.299 --> 16:53.887
If it's not in our data, it's more likely
to be a type of extraterrestrial virus.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.889
Even if it is an extraterrestrial virus,

16:55.973 --> 16:58.017
did it really kill everyone
five years ago?

16:58.642 --> 17:01.353
The others are all fine.

17:01.437 --> 17:06.316
That means it can't be airborne.
He likely caught it through contact.

17:08.068 --> 17:10.654
So how did it spread so quickly
five years ago?

17:30.841 --> 17:31.842
What's wrong?

17:32.426 --> 17:35.596
I can't remember the last time
I've seen such clear water.

17:44.104 --> 17:45.314
Captain.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.274
Are you all right?

17:48.692 --> 17:50.027
How are things going?

17:50.110 --> 17:52.488
Comms are still down.

17:52.571 --> 17:53.655
It doesn't work?

17:56.158 --> 17:57.701
The DU wasn't the problem?

17:57.785 --> 17:59.286
The panel was replaced,

17:59.369 --> 18:01.622
and the system was rebooted
without a problem.

18:01.705 --> 18:04.374
Yes. The system shows
that everything is fine,

18:04.458 --> 18:06.710
but there's no exchange of signals.

18:06.794 --> 18:07.669
Maybe…

18:08.754 --> 18:11.673
The system itself could've been damaged
because of the accident.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.425
You said the system was fine.

18:13.509 --> 18:17.054
Even if there's a problem,
the system may not be able to detect it.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.056
At the moment,

18:20.182 --> 18:22.601
it's impossible
to send or receive any signals.

18:22.684 --> 18:24.019
Any backup radios?

18:25.312 --> 18:29.358
Every single communication device
in this station is down.

18:30.609 --> 18:33.028
I've been searching
for a signal internally,

18:33.112 --> 18:35.114
but I haven't detected anything yet.

18:35.614 --> 18:38.117
I should've checked that first.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.119
Don't mention it.

18:40.661 --> 18:43.413
I should do whatever I can.
I couldn't just space out.

18:43.497 --> 18:44.790
UNKNOWN SIGNAL DETECTED

18:45.541 --> 18:46.416
What's that?

18:47.292 --> 18:48.961
Wait, we got something.

18:49.545 --> 18:50.671
We caught a signal.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.592
UNKNOWN SIGNAL DETECTED

18:56.426 --> 18:59.304
Could it be one
of our communication devices?

18:59.388 --> 19:00.222
No.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.392
It's clearly coming in from the outside.

19:03.475 --> 19:06.270
But none of us are
out there right now. Right?

19:07.229 --> 19:08.147
Where's it being sent?

19:11.483 --> 19:13.277
Storage Three.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.073
The murderer always returns
to the scene of the crime.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.538
Who's sending the signal from the outside?

19:25.122 --> 19:28.041
I'm sure those jerks are with
the rat hiding in the station.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.794
If the intruder had
a separate communication device,

19:30.878 --> 19:33.380
our situation is
most likely exposed to them.

20:03.452 --> 20:04.578
Why is nobody here?

20:39.655 --> 20:42.908
Why does he have something like that?

21:08.725 --> 21:10.811
I didn't like him
from the moment I saw him.

21:10.894 --> 21:13.313
But why did the intruder kill him?

21:13.397 --> 21:15.899
You're right.
Aren't they on the same side?

21:16.483 --> 21:18.277
I don't know what all this
is about anymore.

21:19.152 --> 21:20.904
Can you find out who sent these?

21:20.988 --> 21:23.573
I think he used an older model
for security reasons.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.701
It's not likely, but I'll give it a try.

21:25.784 --> 21:27.411
I've seen the men of RX using these.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.873
Can we communicate with Earth using this?

21:31.957 --> 21:33.292
Yes, it's more than possible.

21:34.209 --> 21:35.877
Let's try to contact Director Choi.

21:38.088 --> 21:39.172
Yes, sir.

21:45.262 --> 21:48.515
He probably fiddled with
the biosignal to lose you two.

21:48.598 --> 21:50.475
And I fell for it.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.271
Did you find anything
on the cause of their deaths?

21:54.354 --> 21:58.358
They all died due to the rapid increase
of water from inside their bodies.

21:58.859 --> 22:00.944
<i>We're still trying to find the cause.</i>

22:04.823 --> 22:05.824
This is odd.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.785
Everything is connected.

22:09.828 --> 22:10.996
This is really odd.

22:11.079 --> 22:12.539
There is no reason for--

22:12.622 --> 22:15.000
It's connected. We're connected.

22:15.917 --> 22:16.918
CONNECTION ACCEPTED

22:17.002 --> 22:18.795
Captain, we're connected.

22:20.547 --> 22:21.548
We'll talk again.

22:41.026 --> 22:45.405
<i>Three died, and one of them was a spy?</i>

22:47.908 --> 22:49.618
<i>It's the worst report I can imagine.</i>

22:49.701 --> 22:53.663
You're the one who approved the co-pilot
to be changed right before we departed.

22:54.414 --> 22:57.042
<i>Once the Inspection Department</i>
<i>hears of this,</i>

22:57.125 --> 23:00.545
<i>they'll conduct a thorough investigation</i>
<i>on the reasons for the replacement.</i>

23:01.046 --> 23:03.215
<i>Of course, it'll include me.</i>

23:04.800 --> 23:08.470
<i>Is there a possibility that other members</i>
<i>could be in league with him?</i>

23:08.970 --> 23:10.138
It cannot be excluded.

23:13.517 --> 23:14.851
<i>What's important is</i>

23:16.395 --> 23:19.147
<i>catching the intruder</i>
<i>who took that sample.</i>

23:20.816 --> 23:24.903
Is it more important to stop the intruder
than to retrieve the samples?

23:24.986 --> 23:28.156
You of all people should know
how valuable these samples are.

23:29.741 --> 23:32.494
I wouldn't have started this
if I'd let anyone else have it.

23:33.745 --> 23:37.624
We need access to level-one areas
to conduct a thorough search.

24:40.395 --> 24:41.521
CLOSED

24:44.399 --> 24:46.026
ENTER THE CODE

24:51.156 --> 24:52.574
<i>Dr. Song, where are you?</i>

24:54.451 --> 24:55.535
Oh, right.

24:55.619 --> 24:56.828
I'll be there soon.

25:01.291 --> 25:03.001
They've been talking for a long time.

25:04.002 --> 25:07.130
"We sent a rescue ship.
Return as soon as possible."

25:07.214 --> 25:08.757
I hope that's what she says.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.884
It's all fucked up, man.

25:19.976 --> 25:21.311
<i>A survivor?</i>

25:21.394 --> 25:23.522
I don't agree with Dr. Song's theory,

25:24.189 --> 25:27.692
but there were questionable aspects
when the co-pilot was killed.

25:29.194 --> 25:30.987
<i>What do you mean, Captain Han?</i>

25:32.822 --> 25:35.909
There are no signs
of radiation leaks in the station.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.080
Were you already aware of this?

25:41.206 --> 25:42.165
What?

25:49.172 --> 25:52.008
You seemed to be very shocked
when I mentioned the spy,

25:52.759 --> 25:54.761
but you seemed indifferent
when I mentioned

25:54.844 --> 25:56.638
that there could be a survivor.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.480
<i>You're the first person who told me</i>

26:05.564 --> 26:08.441
<i>that there are</i>
<i>no signs of radiation leakage.</i>

26:09.067 --> 26:10.277
<i>And…</i>

26:11.695 --> 26:14.197
it's because you mentioned
someone could be alive.

26:15.198 --> 26:17.659
Although it was closed for five years.

26:19.744 --> 26:25.584
Captain Han, perhaps you're starting
to believe Dr. Song's absurd theory.

26:26.668 --> 26:30.088
If you're hiding any information
that could jeopardize my crew's safety,

26:32.048 --> 26:35.051
the success of this operation
is no longer my interest.

26:36.052 --> 26:37.053
As…

26:39.347 --> 26:41.391
the chief officer of this mission,

26:42.183 --> 26:44.853
I wish for the crew's safe return
more than anybody.

26:45.770 --> 26:48.481
<i>There's no reason</i>
<i>for me to hide anything from you.</i>

26:49.274 --> 26:51.526
You must complete
the mission successfully.

26:52.902 --> 26:54.613
Not only will it save your daughter,

26:56.072 --> 26:57.157
<i>it could also save</i>

26:58.158 --> 27:00.076
<i>all of us.</i>

27:11.338 --> 27:13.882
There is absolutely no virus
in this thing.

27:16.176 --> 27:17.427
This is the last one.

27:18.386 --> 27:19.429
The last what?

27:21.306 --> 27:23.099
How long do we have to do this?

27:29.773 --> 27:30.774
Why?

27:30.857 --> 27:31.900
One second.

27:31.983 --> 27:32.942
What is it?

27:37.197 --> 27:38.198
What are you doing?

27:44.079 --> 27:45.455
I want to try something.

28:08.895 --> 28:09.979
What's this?

28:11.106 --> 28:12.232
Why is it doing that?

28:12.315 --> 28:13.149
It's dividing.

28:14.317 --> 28:16.444
What is this? Is something wrong?

28:16.945 --> 28:19.489
-Move back. Step back.
-Why is it doing that?

28:19.572 --> 28:20.448
One second.

28:36.756 --> 28:37.590
Wait.

28:38.258 --> 28:39.634
It stopped multiplying.

28:42.178 --> 28:43.263
What is this?

28:43.346 --> 28:44.597
Why…

28:44.681 --> 28:45.849
Why did it do that?

28:50.562 --> 28:52.814
Blood stays alive
for a while out of the body.

28:52.897 --> 28:54.774
That's why it showed a reaction.

28:54.858 --> 28:57.610
This must be what caused Soochan's death.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.654
Once the host died,

29:00.488 --> 29:01.865
it stopped multiplying.

29:05.618 --> 29:07.287
Water that multiplies…

29:23.219 --> 29:26.055
Then, is there a delay
in schedule for the rescue ship?

29:26.139 --> 29:28.975
Yes, we need more time
to find the intruder and the sample.

29:29.058 --> 29:31.519
How should we capture the intruder?

29:32.103 --> 29:34.981
They should be kept alive,
but if you retrieve the sample,

29:35.482 --> 29:36.900
you may kill the intruder.

29:38.485 --> 29:40.111
We'll search for the intruder.

29:40.195 --> 29:42.322
-Taesuk and Sun, come with--
-Captain.

29:43.364 --> 29:44.491
She's doing this

29:45.492 --> 29:47.827
because we have no lander to take us back.

29:47.911 --> 29:49.829
She's threatening us with the rescue ship.

29:49.913 --> 29:52.373
This isn't how she should ask us
to extend our mission.

29:52.457 --> 29:53.958
It's not how things are done.

30:01.216 --> 30:02.509
Then what do you suggest?

30:05.094 --> 30:07.514
I'm not saying I have a particular plan.

30:08.515 --> 30:09.599
Let's stay focused.

30:10.099 --> 30:11.935
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

30:23.238 --> 30:24.239
Is it water?

30:25.365 --> 30:27.367
The sample we're here to retrieve.

30:28.618 --> 30:29.619
Is it water?

30:37.877 --> 30:39.003
You knew.

30:43.132 --> 30:45.301
I'm sure you are aware of

30:45.385 --> 30:48.346
the space resource development
that countries were competing over.

30:48.429 --> 30:51.391
Nobody was interested in the Moon.

30:52.267 --> 30:55.854
Nothing in particular was found,
so most countries had pulled out.

30:56.688 --> 30:57.689
However,

30:59.023 --> 31:01.860
there is a reason why
we never gave up on the Moon.

31:06.698 --> 31:07.907
<i>We actually found</i>

31:09.701 --> 31:11.411
<i>something very profound.</i>

31:13.371 --> 31:14.539
<i>What is it?</i>

31:18.751 --> 31:19.836
Water.

31:22.213 --> 31:24.007
<i>It was a perfect chance for us</i>

31:24.591 --> 31:28.887
<i>to catch up to other developed countries</i>
<i>as a newcomer in the industry.</i>

31:32.348 --> 31:34.309
Dr. Song Wonkyung called it…

31:36.519 --> 31:38.104
lunar water.

31:44.235 --> 31:47.280
Balhae Station was a place
where they studied the lunar water.

31:48.615 --> 31:51.117
Is there really water on the Moon?

31:51.618 --> 31:54.120
That's everything Director Choi told me.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.831
She said we found water on the Moon,

31:56.915 --> 31:58.625
and if this research is a success,

31:59.584 --> 32:01.294
we could save all of humanity.

32:01.377 --> 32:02.879
Why did you hide this from us?

32:04.756 --> 32:07.300
Why did you go so far
to keep this a secret from us?

32:07.383 --> 32:10.470
It's obvious what would happen
if this information is leaked.

32:10.553 --> 32:13.389
Lee Gisu is dead,
but someone is bound to come after us.

32:13.473 --> 32:17.685
No, the real reason why Director Choi
didn't tell us about the sample

32:18.436 --> 32:21.481
is because that water is
what killed everyone at Balhae Station

32:21.564 --> 32:23.524
as well as Soochan.

32:29.030 --> 32:31.366
What do you mean?

32:33.826 --> 32:36.496
I think we know why Soochan died.

32:36.579 --> 32:37.956
It looks like

32:38.831 --> 32:41.834
Soochan was exposed to the lunar water.

32:42.835 --> 32:44.212
We aren't completely sure,

32:44.796 --> 32:47.382
but the lunar water
seems to act like a virus.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.718
It multiplies
until it takes the host's life.

32:50.802 --> 32:51.719
It multiplies?

32:53.179 --> 32:54.931
The water multiplies?

32:55.598 --> 32:56.516
Yes.

32:57.684 --> 32:59.560
It multiplies endlessly.

33:01.562 --> 33:03.606
I'm sure it seemed like
an amazing resource.

33:04.232 --> 33:06.317
If we could control its multiplication,

33:06.401 --> 33:08.403
if we could commercialize it,

33:09.445 --> 33:11.572
they probably thought
it could save mankind.

33:12.532 --> 33:13.741
If that's possible,

33:14.701 --> 33:15.827
it should happen.

33:22.875 --> 33:25.545
That's what my sister wanted.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.174
Dr. Song Wonkyung.

33:31.050 --> 33:32.677
Yes, Dr. Song Wonkyung.

33:36.973 --> 33:38.016
My sister

33:39.058 --> 33:40.309
wanted that too.

33:42.186 --> 33:43.021
<i>Hey.</i>

33:43.104 --> 33:44.147
It's the Moon.

33:48.109 --> 33:50.111
Do you see those dark spots?

33:52.030 --> 33:54.282
It's called "The Silent Sea."

33:55.450 --> 33:56.492
Long ago,

33:56.993 --> 33:59.662
Galileo thought that was a sea.

33:59.746 --> 34:02.540
That's why he named it the silent sea.

34:04.250 --> 34:06.085
But once we got to the Moon,

34:06.169 --> 34:07.587
there was no sea.

34:09.839 --> 34:11.340
Just like how it is here.

34:13.342 --> 34:16.846
I heard all of this used to be
the sea a long time ago.

34:18.598 --> 34:20.767
The Earth will end up like the Moon.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.061
Right?

34:23.728 --> 34:24.854
Don't worry.

34:26.189 --> 34:29.901
One day, I'll fill up this entire place
and turn it back into the sea.

34:31.319 --> 34:32.153
You will?

34:32.653 --> 34:33.488
Yes.

34:35.073 --> 34:35.990
Wait and see.

34:36.699 --> 34:37.700
<i>One day,</i>

34:38.284 --> 34:39.702
<i>it'll happen.</i>

34:50.505 --> 34:53.633
I can see why everyone risks their lives
to come and get it.

34:54.884 --> 34:57.553
If you succeed,
you'd make a fortune, right?

34:57.637 --> 35:00.098
But it still can't be controlled.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.517
No, it can't be controlled.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.561
We don't even know
how you can get infected.

35:06.145 --> 35:08.564
What about us? Are we all right?

35:09.273 --> 35:10.233
No.

35:13.569 --> 35:14.654
Whatever.

35:16.864 --> 35:20.284
I'm just going to hold out
until the rescue ship comes and go home.

35:20.785 --> 35:23.412
If we can keep the lunar water
under control,

35:25.123 --> 35:28.459
we'll get to live in a world
without any water classification cards.

35:28.543 --> 35:30.503
How are we going to create
a world like that?

35:30.586 --> 35:32.713
She never told us a thing
about our mission,

35:32.797 --> 35:34.382
so we ended up losing Soochan.

35:41.097 --> 35:44.350
I was told it's still under research,
so the substance is very unstable.

35:44.433 --> 35:48.104
It's susceptible to external stimulus,
so it had to be kept at a low temperature.

35:48.187 --> 35:49.772
That external stimulus

35:50.606 --> 35:53.151
is coming in contact
with a living organism.

35:55.361 --> 35:58.239
The researchers here were
infected by the lunar water and died,

35:58.739 --> 36:02.618
but the government covered up everything
to hide the existence of lunar water.

36:07.081 --> 36:09.167
We don't know the symptoms
or how you get infected.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.210
There are too many things we don't know.

36:12.170 --> 36:15.339
I'm not angry at you or blaming you.

36:15.423 --> 36:17.175
I just want information.

36:19.051 --> 36:20.303
I was against it.

36:24.724 --> 36:26.601
I found out you were Dr. Song's sister

36:26.684 --> 36:28.644
and was reluctant to have you on my team.

36:30.479 --> 36:31.731
Why did you come here?

36:35.193 --> 36:36.777
My sister called me here.

36:39.947 --> 36:41.365
What do you mean?

36:41.449 --> 36:42.450
You said

36:43.784 --> 36:46.370
Director Choi gave you
the code to restricted areas.

36:49.832 --> 36:51.375
The data storage of Balhae Station

36:52.460 --> 36:54.670
is inside the main lab.

36:56.172 --> 36:59.800
And I need level-one access
to get in there.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.557
I mean, her sister was the chief here.

37:06.641 --> 37:09.518
How can she not know a thing
about lunar water?

37:11.437 --> 37:13.231
Are you suspicious of her?

37:13.314 --> 37:15.900
No, that's not what I meant.

37:16.609 --> 37:17.610
I'm just saying,

37:18.361 --> 37:20.196
I don't get

37:21.113 --> 37:23.074
why she took up this mission.

37:25.743 --> 37:28.120
She would've been curious,
and it would have felt unfair.

37:35.169 --> 37:37.922
If your family died
and you don't know the reason,

37:38.005 --> 37:40.841
if their death is deemed meaningless
and nothing changes,

37:40.925 --> 37:42.677
I would find everything futile.

37:44.387 --> 37:45.554
And Soochan

37:46.931 --> 37:48.474
would also feel it's unfair.

37:53.437 --> 37:54.605
But I'm not saying

37:54.689 --> 37:57.233
I'll put that before my mission.

38:32.101 --> 38:33.602
How did you know about this?

38:36.564 --> 38:38.024
I just got lucky.

38:38.733 --> 38:42.111
Do you think
you’ll find something in here?

38:44.113 --> 38:45.072
The answer.

38:46.157 --> 38:49.076
You cannot enter the data storage
without authorization.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.161
I know that.

38:50.911 --> 38:52.496
So let me go inside by myself.

39:05.551 --> 39:07.261
I don't trust you yet.

39:21.317 --> 39:23.235
CLOSED
CODE VERIFIED

39:25.654 --> 39:27.615
OPEN

39:53.015 --> 39:54.517
This is a huge amount of data.

39:54.600 --> 39:56.894
There should be a browser somewhere.

40:07.780 --> 40:08.864
What is this?

40:39.061 --> 40:40.312
These are plants.
