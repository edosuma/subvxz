OH, NO!

35:10.859 --> 35:12.395
DOUG, WHAT
IS GOING ON?

35:12.485 --> 35:13.475
WHAT IS THE MATTER?

35:13.570 --> 35:15.527
WHY, THESE PAPERS
WERE ON THE NEWSSTAND

35:15.614 --> 35:17.446

WHAT DO YOU WANT?

35:48.021 --> 35:52.356
A BIT OF FIRE, HMM?

35:52.442 --> 35:58.404
[softly]
AH, YES.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.197

36:54.379 --> 36:56.336
DOUG, I'M SCARED!

36:56.423 --> 36:58.710
THESE THINGS JUST
CAN'T BE HAPPENING!

36:58.800 --> 37:00.131
YOU'VE GOT TO FIRE HIM.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.208
I CAN'T.

37:01.302 --> 37:03.043
VVHY NOT? YOU PAID
BACK THE LOAN.

37:03.138 --> 37:04.378
YOU DON'T OWE
HIM A THING.

37:04.472 --> 37:06.213
I KNOVV, I KNOVV, BUT
I CAN'T, THAT'S ALL!

37:06.266 --> 37:07.552

I CAN'T!

37:07.642 --> 37:08.723
WHY? JUST
KICK HIM OUT!

37:08.810 --> 37:09.845
ON WHAT GROUNDS?

37:09.936 --> 37:11.392
I DON'T KNOW--
INCOMPETENCE.

37:11.438 --> 37:12.428
OH, COME ON,
NOW, YOU KNOW

37:12.522 --> 37:13.762
HE'S A VERY COMPETENT
LINOTYPE OPERATOR

37:13.857 --> 37:14.972
AND A GREAT REPORTER.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.682
DO YOU WANT
HIM AROUND?

37:16.776 --> 37:17.982
IT ISN'T A QUESTION OF
WANTING HIM AROUND.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.059
THEN WHAT IS IT?!

37:19.154 --> 37:20.644
HE'S RUNNING THE
NEWSPAPER NOW.

37:20.739 --> 37:21.774
NOT YOU, HIM!

37:21.865 --> 37:23.481
HE'S DOING A PRETTY GOOD
JOB OF IT, TOO, ISN'T HE?

37:23.575 --> 37:24.565

37:24.617 --> 37:27.530

A LITTLE HASTY?

37:47.182 --> 37:48.798
WOULD YOU MIND
YOU OWN BUSINESS?

37:48.892 --> 37:50.758
THIS IS
MY BUSINESS.

37:50.810 --> 37:52.392
I HAVE A
PROPRIETARY INTEREST

37:52.479 --> 37:54.686

VVITH THE COURIER-

37:54.773 --> 37:56.309
WELL, I AM
NO LONGER CONNECTED

37:56.399 --> 37:57.935

YOU'D RECONSIDER.

37:59.652 --> 38:01.154
THE FACT IS,
I'VE DEVELOPED

38:01.237 --> 38:03.148
A VERY SPECIAL
FONDNESS FOR YOU.

38:03.239 --> 38:05.150

38:24.552 --> 38:26.463
LOVE'S LABOR

38:26.554 --> 38:28.056
SHE'S GONE, VANISHED.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.470
BUT DON'T WORRY...

38:29.557 --> 38:31.514
WE CAN DO WITHOUT <i>HER.</i>

38:35.355 --> 38:36.641
<i>[machinery clicking]</i>

38:42.320 --> 38:44.482
THE PERSON WE CAN
DO WITHOUT IS <i>YOU.</i>

38:44.572 --> 38:46.825
THAT'S AN UNGRATEFUL
THING TO SAY TO A FRIEND

38:46.908 --> 38:48.569
WHO PULLED YOU
OUT OF BANKRUPTCY

38:48.660 --> 38:49.991
AND TURNED THE <i>COURIER</i>

38:50.078 --> 38:51.660

JOURNAL IN THE STATE!

38:51.704 --> 38:53.081
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, MR. SMITH.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.074
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.327
I HAD A NIGHTMARE ABOUT
A VVEIRD LITTLE MAN

38:56.376 --> 38:57.491
WITH A CROOKED CIGAR

38:57.544 --> 38:59.535
WHO CAUSED TERRIBLE
THINGS TO HAPPEN

38:59.629 --> 39:01.586
SO HE COULD GET
SCOOPS FOR MY PAPER.

39:01.673 --> 39:04.005
VVELL, I'M AVVAKE NOVV, AND
I VVANT YOU OUT OF HERE!

39:04.092 --> 39:05.924
NOT SO FAST! VVHAT
ABOUT OUR CONTRACT?

39:06.010 --> 39:07.171
WHAT ABOUT
OUR CONTRACT?

39:07.262 --> 39:08.593
<i>YOU SAID
YOU'D DO ANYTHING</i>

39:08.680 --> 39:10.341
TO MAKE YOUR PAPER
A SUCCESS.

39:10.431 --> 39:12.559
I HEARD YOU.
THAT'S WHY I CAME.

39:12.642 --> 39:15.600
VVELL, I'\/E CARRIED OUT MY PART.
YOU ARE A SUCCESS.

39:15.687 --> 39:18.679
IF YOU'RE NOT A NIGHTMARE, THEN
YOU'RE SOMETHING E\/EN VVORSE

39:18.731 --> 39:21.268
BECAUSE SOMEHOVV YOU'VE
MADE TH ESE THINGS HAPPEN.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.565
YOU'VE CAUSED TRAGEDY.

39:22.652 --> 39:24.518
YOU'VE DESTROYED LIFE
AND PROPERTY.

39:24.612 --> 39:26.478
I DIDN'T BARGAIN FOR THIS!

39:26.573 --> 39:29.110
OH, YES, YOU DID, BUT YOU
PUT IT OUT OF YOUR MIND.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.612
YOU THOUGHT YOU'D GET
EVERYTHING FOR NOTHING.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.364
THAT'S NOT THE
WAY LIFE WORKS.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.704
WELL, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

39:39.752 --> 39:43.711
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST
EDITOR I'\/E HELPED.

39:43.756 --> 39:45.713
I DON'T WANT
YOUR HELP.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.382
IWANT YOU
OUT OF MY LIFE!

39:47.427 --> 39:48.792
CAN'T DO THAT NOW.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.379
<i>WE HAVE AN OBUGPCHON BETWEEN US.</i>

39:51.472 --> 39:52.724

39:54.350 --> 39:55.852
THERE'S ONE
WAY, OF COURSE.

39:55.935 --> 39:56.970
AND WHAT'S THAT?

39:57.061 --> 40:00.429
YOU CAN PAY
UP, RIGHT NOW.

40:00.523 --> 40:02.514
I SUPPOSE THAT MEANS
THAT YOU CAN'T TAKE

40:02.609 --> 40:04.270
MY IMMORTAL SOUL
WHILE I'M ALIVE

40:04.360 --> 40:05.976
AND WALKING AROUND,
IS THAT IT?

40:06.070 --> 40:07.856
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

40:07.947 --> 40:10.860
NOW, WAIT, WAIT.

40:10.950 --> 40:15.285
[sniffs] THIS OLD NOSE
SMELLS A STORY COMING IN.

40:15.371 --> 40:17.203

40:20.793 --> 40:22.875
AH!

40:22.962 --> 40:25.499
A SHAME-- POOR

DID NOT SAY

DIES DEPENDS ON YOU.

CONCLUDE THE CONTRACT,

41:51.968 --> 41:56.929
YOU'LL FIND THIS A LOT
SURER THAN THE BRIDGE.
