WEBVTT

00:19.856 --> 00:23.985
Ah. Mine, I think. Just get...

00:24.068 --> 00:27.613
Dirty magazines, Hector?
Huh! At your age.

00:27.697 --> 00:28.906
Please.

00:35.455 --> 00:37.373
Good morning, Archie.

01:31.678 --> 01:35.139
-It's from Lizzie.
-Is she coming up?

01:35.223 --> 01:37.140
I'm sure my sister
has better things to do

01:37.225 --> 01:39.684
than to rush up here
just because it's
my birthday tomorrow.

01:39.769 --> 01:42.813
-Morning all.
-Oh, Archie,
it's not just any birthday.

01:42.897 --> 01:44.315
It's a special birthday.

01:44.399 --> 01:46.818
I just wish everyone
would forget about it.
I want to.

01:46.901 --> 01:51.406
And what about you, Father?
Isn't this your cue
for a special speech?

01:51.489 --> 01:53.449
What speech is that, lad?

01:53.532 --> 01:55.785
The same speech we've
heard every day this week.

01:55.868 --> 01:58.037
The one that goes,
"When I was your age,

01:58.121 --> 02:03.459
"I'd liberated
Europe from the Hun
and sired half a polo team."

02:03.543 --> 02:08.131
Archie, you're a grown man.
You don't need me
interfering in your future.

02:08.214 --> 02:10.842
Right, that's settled, then.
No fuss.

02:11.634 --> 02:14.554
-BOTH: No fuss.
-Good.

02:17.557 --> 02:20.518
Gather the troops, Lexie.
Boathouse, five minutes.

02:22.311 --> 02:23.312
Ah.

02:31.821 --> 02:35.199
It's just that I thought
I'd have more responsibility.

02:35.283 --> 02:37.035
Did you?

02:37.118 --> 02:41.748
I mean,
Assistant Head Ranger...
I'm still just a skivvy.

02:41.830 --> 02:45.710
Will you change the record?
It's Archie's ear you
should be bending, not mine.

02:45.793 --> 02:48.629
Aye, and maybe he
doesn't think I'm up to it.

02:48.713 --> 02:51.090
But, Duncan, you'll
never know unless you ask.

02:51.174 --> 02:53.843
-Report for duty.
-What duty?

02:55.136 --> 02:57.138
Children's party detail.

03:05.146 --> 03:07.857
ARCHIE: You've done
a great job setting up
the nature trail, Fergal.

03:07.940 --> 03:09.275
FERGAL: It'll be good to try
it out, you know,

03:09.359 --> 03:12.195
before the
paying punters
start turning up.

03:12.278 --> 03:16.616
-Yeah, that's fine by me.
-Cool. I'll tell Katrina.

03:16.699 --> 03:18.826
-Katrina?
-Yeah.

03:18.910 --> 03:21.913
She said the kids
would love to see
round the estate.

03:21.996 --> 03:25.458
You're seeing quite
a lot of her, aren't you?

03:25.541 --> 03:28.002
Not as much as I'd like to.

03:32.173 --> 03:34.092
No need to wait.

04:01.536 --> 04:04.747
Now, we need to
find the fairy lights,
the streamers...

04:04.831 --> 04:07.166
Oh, and there's a banner
around the house somewhere.

04:07.250 --> 04:10.712
We have to move quickly
because Archie's going to move
all this stuff out today

04:10.795 --> 04:12.922
so
the contractors can move in.

04:13.798 --> 04:16.426
Hey. Look at this.

04:17.802 --> 04:20.762
MOLLY:
Oh, what a party that was.

04:20.846 --> 04:23.599
Rained all day,
but we still had
the most wonderful time.

04:23.683 --> 04:25.727
Remember, Golly?

04:25.810 --> 04:29.688
I remember young Lizzie eating
too much cake and throwing up
into the fruit punch.

04:29.772 --> 04:31.399
Wee Jamie, he...

04:34.527 --> 04:37.238
Oh, it's all right.
You can talk about Jamie.

04:37.321 --> 04:40.491
I wish people would
talk about him more.

04:40.575 --> 04:42.160
This was his.

04:45.329 --> 04:49.667
It's funny. Something about
the sound of
children I remember most.

04:49.751 --> 04:53.129
Shouting,
arguing, giggling, laughing.

04:53.212 --> 04:57.091
All just seemed to
say life is wonderful.

04:57.175 --> 05:00.887
Oh, Hector used to
love racing these
with the boys.

05:00.970 --> 05:03.097
This house was so full of joy.

05:03.181 --> 05:07.018
Then it's time it was again
and we can start with
Archie's party tomorrow.

05:07.101 --> 05:09.771
It'll be the best
MacDonald birthday party
in the history of...

05:09.854 --> 05:12.231
BOTH:
MacDonald birthday parties.

05:15.735 --> 05:18.196
HECTOR:
Well, of course, old chap,
why not pop over today?

05:18.279 --> 05:23.034
Well, shall we say at 4:00?
Excellent. Thanks for ringing.

05:23.117 --> 05:25.661
Archie will hit
the roof when he sees this.

05:25.745 --> 05:28.164
He'll thank me
for it later on.

05:28.247 --> 05:29.791
We've got to get him hitched.

05:29.874 --> 05:32.669
Good Lord,
by the time I was 30,
I had three children.

05:32.752 --> 05:35.338
I know. I was there.

05:35.421 --> 05:38.299
But, of course you were.
He's got to live up to
his responsibility...

05:38.383 --> 05:39.509
(PHONE RINGING)

05:39.592 --> 05:41.052
Hello.

05:41.135 --> 05:43.471
Oh, hello, Your Lordship.

05:43.554 --> 05:46.015
Yes? Yea...

05:46.099 --> 05:49.977
But of course you can bring
your daughter over
to meet the laird.

05:50.061 --> 05:52.271
Yes, absolutely delighted.

05:53.731 --> 05:55.775
Yes, bye, Your Lordship.

05:57.110 --> 05:58.361
Oh!

06:01.531 --> 06:03.866
You know,
I could've saved you a trip.

06:03.950 --> 06:08.705
I've got to go up to the Big
House later to pay my rent
and tug my forelock.

06:08.788 --> 06:11.498
Well, I wanted to tell you
the good news straightaway.

06:11.582 --> 06:13.334
Kids'll have a great
time tomorrow, you know.

06:13.418 --> 06:18.589
Yeah. Thanks.
And, you know,
I think you deserve a reward.

06:18.673 --> 06:20.800
Oh? And what did
you have in mind?

06:20.883 --> 06:22.969
Hmm... Coffee?

06:24.804 --> 06:29.600
Well,
I've a million things to do.
You can thank me another time.

06:29.684 --> 06:31.769
Without MI5 observing us.

06:44.615 --> 06:47.869
-If you'd just wait in here?
Thanks.
-Thank you.

06:55.126 --> 06:59.213
Molly? Come here.

06:59.297 --> 07:03.092
You have to see this.
You're never
gonna believe this.

07:03.176 --> 07:06.346
-Look. They're all
queuing up in here.
-What?

07:08.806 --> 07:11.309
-Go get Archie immediately.
-Right.

07:19.150 --> 07:22.111
Archie, I was wondering,

07:22.195 --> 07:24.364
as Assistant Head Ranger,

07:24.447 --> 07:27.325
I was thinking...
I was hoping,

07:27.408 --> 07:31.454
that I'd get to be showing
some of
the trekking parties around.

07:35.416 --> 07:37.210
Forget it. Bad idea.

07:37.293 --> 07:39.295
No, it's a good idea.

07:39.379 --> 07:44.008
Well, you know
the place as well as anyone.
I'll talk to Fergal about it.

07:45.510 --> 07:49.180
Right.
Thanks. I won't let you down.

07:54.352 --> 07:58.940
Arch, Hector wants to
see you in the ballroom,
matter of extreme urgency.

07:59.816 --> 08:00.817
Oh.

08:09.575 --> 08:12.203
Thank you, Alexandra.

08:18.292 --> 08:21.462
-Lovely to see
you again, Gordon.
-You too, old chap.

08:25.883 --> 08:31.556
The last time that we
saw you, the girls were...
how old?

08:31.639 --> 08:33.099
BOTH: Twelve.

08:34.767 --> 08:36.644
That'll be all, Lexie.

08:45.820 --> 08:49.532
(STAMMERING) So...what
do you do these days?

08:53.910 --> 08:55.580
What do you mean?

08:58.249 --> 09:01.377
Why don't I show you
around the house, Gordon?

09:05.340 --> 09:07.842
LEXIE: Just because you've got
some fancy new title...

09:07.925 --> 09:13.598
Assistant Head Ranger,
with special responsibilities
for guided tours.

09:13.681 --> 09:15.683
It doesn't give you
the right to take food
without asking.

09:15.767 --> 09:18.603
I told you, I didn't.

09:18.686 --> 09:21.564
Right, so that salmon
just uncooked itself
and swam away, did it?

09:21.647 --> 09:23.566
GOLLY: How long has this
food been going missing?

09:23.649 --> 09:25.568
A couple of days now.

09:28.404 --> 09:29.906
And I know
this is premature...

09:29.989 --> 09:31.866
But we may as well
get it out of the way.

09:31.949 --> 09:36.412
-You see, I'd prefer July.
-But September
would suit me better.

09:36.496 --> 09:38.331
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

09:38.414 --> 09:40.416
-For a wedding.
-For a...

09:42.585 --> 09:44.504
Just what is going on here?

09:44.587 --> 09:49.217
Your father says here
you'd be anxious to do
it before the year is out.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.520
Sorry,
it's all been a mistake.

10:00.603 --> 10:03.731
-GORDON: Mistake?
-Yes, I am not up
for auction, thank you.

10:10.029 --> 10:11.280
Goodbye.

10:12.615 --> 10:13.825
Father.

10:20.790 --> 10:23.626
I'm only trying to help.
A chap your age needs
a woman by his side.

10:23.710 --> 10:28.089
I have told you countless
times that when and indeed
if I decide to marry...

10:28.172 --> 10:30.508
-If?
-It will be to
somebody that I care about.

10:30.591 --> 10:32.593
What about that Justine woman?
You were with her for years.

10:32.677 --> 10:34.053
Oh, Father,
you and Justine
hated each other.

10:34.137 --> 10:36.806
I did not. She had a spark.
I admired that.

10:36.889 --> 10:39.308
-Wide enough hips.
-Oh,
so that's what this is about.

10:39.392 --> 10:42.895
Not my future bride,
but your future grandchild.

10:42.979 --> 10:45.106
You have a responsibility
to your lineage.

10:45.189 --> 10:47.483
Stay out of my
private life, do you hear?

10:47.567 --> 10:51.529
If you don't, I'll, I'll...
I'll have the snip.

10:51.612 --> 10:54.323
-Snip?
-I will have my
lineage cut off.

11:11.591 --> 11:13.092
Hector.

11:13.176 --> 11:17.513
This house is tainted
by a lack of
moral responsibility.

11:17.597 --> 11:20.058
How nice to see
you too, Katrina.

11:37.533 --> 11:39.160
Poor old Archie.

11:44.540 --> 11:48.044
You don't have to
have time for dynasties,

11:48.127 --> 11:51.589
but you must find
some time for yourself.

11:51.673 --> 11:55.468
Forget about this
place for five minutes.

11:55.551 --> 11:58.930
What do they say these days?
Chill out.

12:01.974 --> 12:04.018
While you're still young.

12:10.650 --> 12:14.821
If money were no object,
what would you buy?

12:14.904 --> 12:18.533
You know that. I'd
secure a future for Glenbogle.

12:19.951 --> 12:23.121
I don't mean that.
What would you buy for you?

12:24.664 --> 12:27.000
Well, I've always
fancied a Porsche.

12:28.376 --> 12:29.585
Really?

12:30.753 --> 12:32.380
Yeah, a red one.

12:39.470 --> 12:43.933
(CLEARS THROAT) I'll need some
help to set up
the beach for the party.

12:44.017 --> 12:48.021
Oh, sorry. I've got my
Assistant Head
Ranger duties to perform.

12:48.104 --> 12:49.647
What?

12:49.731 --> 12:53.818
I've agreed to let
Duncan take our first group
round the estate.

12:53.901 --> 12:58.072
A bit like The Blair
Witch Project all over again.

12:58.156 --> 13:00.408
Take no notice, Duncan.
You'll be great.

13:00.491 --> 13:03.036
Anyway,
the teachers will be with him.

13:03.119 --> 13:06.122
-Teachers?
-Yep.

13:06.205 --> 13:08.166
It's the kids from the school
you'll be showing round.

13:08.249 --> 13:10.585
Did you say kid... Children?

13:11.919 --> 13:15.548
Fifteen sweet
little 10-year olds.

13:15.631 --> 13:19.552
It's a party of children,
Dunc,
not a party of axe murderers.

13:22.221 --> 13:23.514
(SCREAMS)

13:29.687 --> 13:34.567
You know it was a mistake,
don't you? The bank cocked up
the direct debits, that's all.

13:34.650 --> 13:36.903
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry about
the threatening letter.

13:36.986 --> 13:40.448
It goes out to
any of the tenants
who get into arrears.

13:40.531 --> 13:45.995
-Just another one of
your tenants now, am I?
-You know I didn't mean...

13:46.079 --> 13:48.998
I gather Fergal's asked you
to bring
the kids over tomorrow.

13:49.082 --> 13:52.460
-It was my idea actually.
-Right.

13:52.543 --> 13:55.296
It must be good having someone
like Fergal around.

13:55.380 --> 13:59.175
Really seems to know how
to make the place work.

13:59.258 --> 14:01.552
Certainly understands people.

14:02.595 --> 14:04.347
You included?

14:04.430 --> 14:08.935
What goes on between me
and Fergal is my business,
don't you think?

14:09.018 --> 14:11.604
-You'd better come quick.
-What is it?

14:11.688 --> 14:13.564
There's one of your tenants
in my kitchen

14:13.648 --> 14:16.651
saying that you
chucked him out onto
the street.

14:20.279 --> 14:23.866
At least you
understand responsibility,
loyalty, duty.

14:26.160 --> 14:27.829
(CAR HORN HONKING)

14:40.008 --> 14:42.260
-Hector MacDonald?
-Yes?

14:42.343 --> 14:45.722
Kieran Conway. We
spoke on the phone earlier.

14:45.805 --> 14:49.350
Oh, yes. I'm afraid
you've had a wasted journey.

14:49.434 --> 14:51.936
This is my daughter Tanya.

14:55.231 --> 14:57.066
Absolutely enchanted.

14:58.568 --> 15:02.697
-I'm sorry, Mister...
-Tosh, Tosh McKellan.

15:02.780 --> 15:05.450
Yes,
but I really don't understand
what you're talking about.

15:05.533 --> 15:07.702
I have never evicted
any of my tenants, ever.

15:07.785 --> 15:10.830
Not you. Your father.

15:10.913 --> 15:13.416
-I might've known.
-FERGAL:
Evicted you from where?

15:13.499 --> 15:16.377
My cottage. By the west wood.

15:16.461 --> 15:19.130
KATRINA: Is that one of the
ones that you've been
renting out to tourists?

15:19.213 --> 15:21.090
ARCHIE: They've
been vacant for years.

15:21.174 --> 15:23.968
Sent me to a home, they did.
I didn't want to go there.

15:24.052 --> 15:28.306
Wanted to stay in
the house I lived in 46 years.

15:28.389 --> 15:31.100
I am sorry, Mr McKellan,
but you are going to
have to go back to the home.

15:31.184 --> 15:32.935
I'll not go back there.

15:33.019 --> 15:35.730
You're the laird.
I am your responsibility.

15:35.813 --> 15:40.109
-Well, you can't stay here.
-Archie, he can bunk
down with me tonight.

15:40.193 --> 15:43.154
We can just sort it
out in the morning.

15:43.237 --> 15:44.739
Right, thanks.

15:45.990 --> 15:49.535
-Arch, you're wanted.
-Oh, now what?

15:49.619 --> 15:51.788
-You've got guests.
-Guests.

15:51.871 --> 15:55.875
An elderly gentleman
and his young,
very unmarried daughter.

15:57.752 --> 15:58.920
Right.

16:01.297 --> 16:03.716
I'm sorry to
disappoint you all,
but I am going to my room

16:03.800 --> 16:07.345
and I shall emerge
sometime after
my 70th birthday.

16:07.428 --> 16:09.806
You have had a wasted journey,
I'm afraid.

16:09.889 --> 16:14.143
I told my father
of my intention to take
a lifetime vow of chastity

16:14.227 --> 16:17.772
some months ago but he
seems to have forgotten.

16:17.855 --> 16:20.400
Archie, may I introduce you to
the Earl of Nissalagh,

16:20.483 --> 16:22.610
from the beautiful
Republic of Ireland?

16:22.694 --> 16:26.864
-Good night.
-And may I
introduce my daughter Tanya?

16:43.381 --> 16:44.716
Hello.

17:09.323 --> 17:10.992
Have you got
something on your mind?

17:11.075 --> 17:15.704
Oh, it's just...
These kids coming tomorrow...

17:15.788 --> 17:17.290
-What?
-Well...

17:18.540 --> 17:21.127
You might find
this hard to believe,

17:21.210 --> 17:23.296
me being a man of
the world and that,

17:23.378 --> 17:29.552
but when I was a kid,
I was an object of
fun and ridicule.

17:29.635 --> 17:33.014
-Surely not.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

17:33.931 --> 17:35.767
Butt of the jokes.

17:35.850 --> 17:39.937
The guy that had his bike
stolen, the itching powder
down his sports...

17:40.021 --> 17:43.441
It's just because I
wanted to learn stuff,
you know.

17:44.275 --> 17:45.651
I never...

17:47.028 --> 17:49.113
I never had any friends.

17:51.323 --> 17:54.493
HECTOR: No, no, no, I insist.
You'll both stay the night.

17:54.577 --> 17:57.997
-Well,
that's jolly decent of you.
-Not at all, old chap.

17:58.081 --> 18:01.876
Go through.
I'll get Lexie to take
the port to the library.

18:03.419 --> 18:05.004
Going rather well,
don't you think?

18:05.088 --> 18:07.882
I thought Archie told you
to stop this skulduggery.

18:07.965 --> 18:11.636
Listen, that chap has
a huge estate in Ireland.

18:11.719 --> 18:13.471
Now,
I don't want to be vulgar,

18:13.554 --> 18:15.890
but an alliance
would solve all our
financial problems.

18:15.973 --> 18:18.351
Hector,
this isn't the Middle Ages.

18:18.434 --> 18:22.438
People don't marry
to secure dynasties
and increase their assets.

18:22.522 --> 18:26.567
Archie's got enough on his
plate without worrying about
the precious family line.

18:26.651 --> 18:30.154
Besides, you can't just
throw two people
together like that.

18:30.238 --> 18:32.240
We were thrown together.

18:32.323 --> 18:35.743
Yes, and I wish that I could
say that it was love at
first sight, but it wasn't.

18:35.827 --> 18:38.871
We grew together
and I learned to know

18:38.955 --> 18:42.208
what a warm, kind-hearted,
wonderful man that you are

18:42.291 --> 18:47.547
and then, and only then,
did I fall deeply
in love with you.

18:47.630 --> 18:51.300
Archie deserves that chance.

18:51.384 --> 18:55.555
-We thought
we'd go for a walk.
-It's such a lovely night.

18:55.638 --> 18:57.640
HECTOR: Yes.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.398
(HUMMING THE WEDDING MARCH)

19:10.611 --> 19:12.655
TANYA: This is stunning.

19:14.198 --> 19:15.783
You're so lucky.

19:17.326 --> 19:20.455
ARCHIE: You must have
views like this at home.

19:20.538 --> 19:23.458
Yeah. Yeah, but I
never have time to look.

19:25.251 --> 19:27.295
Yep, I know that feeling.

19:30.590 --> 19:33.468
I hope you don't
mind me saying so,

19:33.551 --> 19:36.679
but you don't seem
obvious laird material.

19:36.763 --> 19:40.892
Well, I wasn't supposed to be.
I had an older brother, Jamie.
He died.

19:42.143 --> 19:43.644
Oh. I'm sorry.

19:48.107 --> 19:52.570
Yes, I was kind of
thrown into this laird stuff.

19:52.653 --> 19:57.033
Mostly I've been
trying to prove myself
to my father.

19:57.116 --> 19:59.619
What about you,
your old man the same?

19:59.702 --> 20:01.412
Yeah, I guess so.

20:03.081 --> 20:04.791
I'm all he's got.

20:06.334 --> 20:08.002
Well, you must have
more time on your hands

20:08.086 --> 20:11.255
now that you've managed
to turn the estate around.

20:11.339 --> 20:14.258
Yeah, true.
It was tough, though.

20:15.843 --> 20:18.971
Had to sell off
the family silver.

20:19.055 --> 20:20.932
Tell me about it.

20:21.015 --> 20:24.227
Oh, of course,
Father made me keep
some stuff back,

20:24.310 --> 20:26.729
things he could
never part with.

20:27.855 --> 20:30.191
Bet Hector did the same.

20:30.274 --> 20:33.611
Well, if he has,
he's never told me about it.

20:33.695 --> 20:36.155
The truth is,
we are stony-broke.

20:39.992 --> 20:42.995
-Broke?
-Completely skint.

20:43.079 --> 20:45.540
They're pinning
all their hopes
on this Visitor Centre.

20:45.623 --> 20:47.375
Damn.

20:47.458 --> 20:48.876
We'd best get out of here
first thing.

20:48.960 --> 20:51.796
Oh, no. I have
spent a fortune on this.

20:51.879 --> 20:54.090
Hiring that car,
the suit, those diamonds.

20:54.173 --> 20:56.009
I'm not leaving here without
some kind of compensation.

20:56.092 --> 20:58.261
They haven't got
anything worth nicking, Dad.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.513
Don't you believe it.

21:00.596 --> 21:02.849
These aristos
always say they're broke.

21:02.932 --> 21:06.394
But they never
mention the Gainsborough
stashed away in the attic.

21:07.979 --> 21:11.107
Look, I'll work on
the old duffer tomorrow.

21:15.528 --> 21:17.238
You charm the lad.

22:04.410 --> 22:09.290
Welcome to Glenbogle.
My name is Dunc.

22:09.374 --> 22:12.168
I'm called...
I'm called Duncan

22:12.251 --> 22:15.880
and this place is
called Glenbogle.

22:15.963 --> 22:17.757
So Archie doesn't
know about the party?

22:17.840 --> 22:20.927
No, so whatever it takes,
you just keep him
away from the beach.

22:21.010 --> 22:24.013
-Well, how will I do that?
-I'm sure you'll
think of something.

22:24.097 --> 22:26.057
-ARCHIE: Gone?
-Yeah.

22:26.140 --> 22:28.601
He bedded down on my sofa
last night. I woke up
this morning, no sign of him.

22:28.685 --> 22:30.520
Maybe he decided to
go back to the home?

22:30.603 --> 22:33.356
-No chance.
-We'll have to search for him.
Dunc?

22:33.439 --> 22:36.359
Sorry, I've got to look
after the school kids.

22:36.442 --> 22:38.319
I'll ask around.

22:38.403 --> 22:40.738
-Who's he?
-Oh, don't you start.

22:44.409 --> 22:46.661
They seem to be
getting on awfully well.

22:48.413 --> 22:50.123
Indeed.

22:50.206 --> 22:53.209
So, how many acres
do you have here?

22:53.292 --> 22:58.506
-About 38,500.
-Ooh. Not a bad little plot.

22:58.589 --> 23:01.676
Little? How many acres
do you have in Ireland, then?

23:01.759 --> 23:04.303
Oh,
give or take, about 50,000.

23:04.387 --> 23:06.305
Excellent. Excellent.

23:06.389 --> 23:08.933
Still, this old pile of
yours is pretty impressive.

23:09.017 --> 23:13.604
Yes, well, it could do
with a coat of paint,
I suppose.

23:13.688 --> 23:16.816
-You're not fooling anyone.
-I'm not?

23:16.899 --> 23:20.319
Keep this place
looking rundown,
scare away the taxman.

23:20.403 --> 23:21.696
Well...

23:21.779 --> 23:23.823
Still, it's always
a sign of true breeding,

23:23.906 --> 23:28.077
keeping the really expensive
stuff under lock and key.
Most unostentatious.

23:28.161 --> 23:31.205
Well, I've never seen the need
to flaunt one's wealth.

23:31.289 --> 23:33.458
I've lots of
antiques hidden away.

23:33.541 --> 23:36.878
Really? Me, too. Oh, yes.

23:42.675 --> 23:44.135
Quickly now.

23:52.643 --> 23:56.856
Right.
Well, over to you, Duncan.

24:05.114 --> 24:08.534
Welcome to Glenbogle.

24:08.618 --> 24:12.747
My name's Duncan
and I'm your show
here to guide you...

24:14.082 --> 24:18.795
I mean, I'm your guide
here to show you around

24:18.878 --> 24:22.965
this ancient and very old...

24:25.593 --> 24:27.428
and beautiful estate.

24:32.100 --> 24:35.103
-Let's get started.
-I'll catch up later.

24:40.858 --> 24:42.110
Come on.

24:48.116 --> 24:50.159
Maybe Fergal's found him.

24:52.120 --> 24:53.788
-Hi.
-Hi.

24:55.707 --> 24:57.792
-Happy birthday.
-Thanks.

24:59.711 --> 25:03.798
-Hello.
-Sorry.
Katrina, this is Tanya.

25:03.881 --> 25:06.259
Nice to meet you.

25:06.342 --> 25:09.178
So, any special
plans for the big day?

25:09.262 --> 25:12.557
Oh, yes,
we're playing hide-and-seek
with an octogenarian tenant.

25:12.640 --> 25:13.850
What?

25:13.933 --> 25:16.394
-Okay, I found Tosh.
-ARCHIE: Oh, good.

25:16.477 --> 25:17.687
Not good.

25:22.483 --> 25:25.361
Sorry,
Archie, he must've nicked
the chain from my place.

25:25.445 --> 25:28.072
I'll not budge till you
give me my cottage back.

25:28.156 --> 25:30.450
Be reasonable.
You can't stay here.

25:30.533 --> 25:32.285
I claim squatter's rights.

25:32.368 --> 25:34.078
Well, I'm calling the police.

25:34.162 --> 25:36.748
He's your tenant, Archie,
he's your responsibility.

25:36.831 --> 25:38.583
Well, he's got to go.
The contractor's been paid

25:38.666 --> 25:40.418
a fortune to sort
this place out.

25:40.501 --> 25:42.628
He's a person with feelings.

25:42.712 --> 25:45.048
I'm sure Archie's doing
what's best for the estate.

25:45.131 --> 25:46.716
Oh, and you'd know all
about that, would you?

25:46.799 --> 25:50.553
Okay, come on, Tosh.
Let's talk about this outside.

25:54.057 --> 25:57.810
I'll not budge till you
give me my cottage back.

26:16.371 --> 26:17.830
HECTOR: Kieran?

26:21.626 --> 26:22.919
Kieran?

26:23.795 --> 26:26.297
Where are you, old chap?

26:26.381 --> 26:29.467
-Ah, there you are, old chap.
-What have you got there?

26:29.550 --> 26:31.886
Ah, Robert the Bruce.
Excellent.

26:41.312 --> 26:45.483
Oh, Lexie.
Oh. Do you need a hand?

26:45.566 --> 26:49.654
I need several pairs.
Did you get Archie's present?

26:49.737 --> 26:53.866
-Yes, red one.
Pop-up headlights. The lot.
-Mmm.

27:05.378 --> 27:09.632
Archie, they're
gonna be on double time
in a couple of hours.

27:11.676 --> 27:14.220
-Okay, okay.
-What are you gonna do?

27:17.015 --> 27:20.643
Well, he'll have to come out
when he's hungry, won't he?

27:22.061 --> 27:25.523
Well, he has to eat.
Here you are, Tosh.

27:27.984 --> 27:29.610
Excuse me.

27:29.694 --> 27:31.779
Now, there's ham and cheese.

27:31.863 --> 27:34.657
I didn't know
whether you took sugar
so I didn't stir.

27:36.659 --> 27:38.953
-She's very pretty.
-I'm sorry?

27:40.288 --> 27:41.748
TANYA: Katrina.

27:41.831 --> 27:44.584
-KATRINA: How're you feeling?
-Yes, I suppose she is.

27:47.837 --> 27:52.050
-What's the story?
-She's just another
one of my tenants.

28:01.768 --> 28:03.853
DUNCAN: These trees are...

28:04.812 --> 28:06.230
Well, firs.

28:10.985 --> 28:13.571
And these ones
over here are...

28:16.783 --> 28:18.659
Firs, too.

28:18.743 --> 28:21.204
Duncan,
they've seen trees before.

28:21.788 --> 28:23.039
Right.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.754
One of the reasons that
this place is so important

28:29.837 --> 28:34.050
is because of the amazing
amount of...wildlife.

28:37.387 --> 28:39.430
You like animals, right?

28:45.561 --> 28:48.981
-Yes?
-Is this forest natural?

28:49.065 --> 28:51.651
Or has it been
replanted by the landowners?

28:51.734 --> 28:53.319
CHILDREN: Hmm?

28:54.612 --> 28:56.739
Well, well, this is...
This is mainly natural.

28:56.823 --> 29:00.868
But if you like,
I can take you up
to our new replanting project.

29:00.952 --> 29:03.663
-CHILDREN: Mmm...
-Maybe not.

29:05.081 --> 29:06.708
Bad idea.

29:08.084 --> 29:10.378
Right, let's have a break.

29:18.761 --> 29:20.430
-They hate me.
-Of course they do.

29:20.513 --> 29:23.808
You're an adult.
You're doing fine.

29:44.412 --> 29:49.375
-That room's out of bounds,
I'm afraid, old chap.
-Buried treasure, eh?

29:49.459 --> 29:52.587
It's my late son's room.
Family only, I'm afraid.

29:52.670 --> 29:56.716
Come and have
a look at this music box.
It's over a hundred years old.

29:57.717 --> 29:59.344
(MUSIC BOX PLAYING)

30:04.307 --> 30:06.267
(CHILDREN YELLING)

30:15.360 --> 30:19.030
Okay, my wee friends.
Time to go.

30:21.366 --> 30:24.577
Right, back in line now!

30:28.915 --> 30:32.001
Sometimes they just
need to know who's boss.

30:47.433 --> 30:49.560
Odd one out, eh?

30:49.644 --> 30:51.771
-What's your name?
-Duncan.

30:54.899 --> 30:56.609
I'll die here.

30:56.693 --> 30:59.779
I have had enough of this.
My father would not
have kicked him out.

30:59.862 --> 31:01.447
That's what he did.

31:01.531 --> 31:04.784
I could still have
done a decent day's work.

31:04.867 --> 31:06.911
You know that's not true.

31:08.746 --> 31:11.916
You tell him what
really happened.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.836
-I'll not budge.
-What happened, Tosh?

31:19.132 --> 31:21.759
My Annie died,
that's what happened.

31:22.593 --> 31:24.095
Annie?

31:24.178 --> 31:25.847
Without her, I...

31:26.639 --> 31:28.516
I didn't cope so well.

31:30.476 --> 31:33.980
The truth is I went to pieces.

31:34.063 --> 31:37.025
I'd always had her
beside me, 40-odd years.

31:38.234 --> 31:40.278
When she went so sudden,

31:42.238 --> 31:43.948
it was a bad time.

31:46.242 --> 31:48.536
I stopped behaving like a man.

31:49.746 --> 31:52.665
Stopped looking after meself.

31:52.749 --> 31:55.501
Lost my self-respect.

31:55.585 --> 31:58.087
They packed me
off to that place.

32:00.048 --> 32:04.677
But I'm stronger now.
I could do a day's work.

32:06.971 --> 32:09.015
I want my dignity back.

32:10.308 --> 32:12.393
I want my home back.

32:22.153 --> 32:23.946
-Thanks.
-What for?

32:25.031 --> 32:27.450
Asking a question earlier.

32:27.533 --> 32:29.702
That really helped
me out, that did.

32:29.786 --> 32:32.872
Girls think it isn't
cool if you ask questions.

32:32.955 --> 32:36.542
If you keep asking questions,
you become really clever.

32:37.418 --> 32:39.087
You could be a...

32:40.588 --> 32:43.633
You could be a doctor
or an astronaut maybe.

32:43.716 --> 32:46.719
Did you ask
questions at school?

32:46.803 --> 32:50.014
Well, I used to but
the other kids, they...

32:50.098 --> 32:55.311
Well, they put me off. I wish
they hadn't. I wish I'd kept
asking questions.

32:56.521 --> 32:59.482
So you could've
been an astronaut?

32:59.565 --> 33:02.652
-Aye.
-I think your job's dead cool.

33:04.320 --> 33:06.406
Can I have your autograph?

33:19.961 --> 33:25.508
Tosh, I would love to help
you, but I have other
people to think of.

33:25.591 --> 33:29.053
Things have moved on
since you were a tenant here.

33:29.137 --> 33:33.683
I wish I could let you stay,
but we just can't afford it.

33:35.768 --> 33:39.439
There was a time when this
estate employed 100
workers on the land

33:39.522 --> 33:45.111
and 50 in the house, but...
Well, now we only have four.

33:45.194 --> 33:48.740
If I don't balance the books
and make this
place pay, then...

33:48.823 --> 33:51.617
no one'll have a home here.
No one.

33:55.580 --> 33:58.082
I'm sorry, Tosh.
I can't help you.

34:05.298 --> 34:10.469
It's called Autumn Days,
the number's in the book.

34:18.018 --> 34:20.103
Happy birthday to me.

34:37.914 --> 34:41.708
Golly,
you've been saying recently
that you could do with a hand.

34:41.793 --> 34:44.504
You know,
odd jobs from time to time.

34:45.380 --> 34:46.505
What?

34:48.341 --> 34:51.552
Oh, aye, aye. That's right.

34:51.636 --> 34:56.974
And I was wondering how much
the council are paying
to keep Tosh at that home?

34:57.058 --> 35:00.978
I could ask them
if they'd pay for
the cottage instead.

35:01.979 --> 35:03.648
Well done, Archie.

35:05.983 --> 35:09.404
Right, I think you can
move back into your cottage.

35:10.488 --> 35:13.157
-Do you mean it?
-Absolutely.

35:13.241 --> 35:17.203
You'll not get it
for free, though.
Golly here needs some help.

35:17.286 --> 35:19.997
You're a top man, Archie.

35:20.081 --> 35:24.127
You're taking a risk,
but I won't let you down.

35:42.645 --> 35:45.689
TANYA: It just feels wrong.

35:45.773 --> 35:48.693
These people,
they're up against it.

35:48.775 --> 35:50.861
Archie has to
make this place work.

35:50.944 --> 35:53.823
We've all got
to make a living.

35:53.906 --> 35:56.409
It's not just
about the money, Dad.

35:57.368 --> 36:00.163
These are decent folk.

36:00.245 --> 36:03.332
They support each other.
They rally round.

36:03.415 --> 36:06.878
Has this young lad
turned your head, huh?

36:06.961 --> 36:10.631
Listen, we might never get
a chance like this again.

36:10.714 --> 36:12.799
They'll all be at
Archie's party later.

36:12.884 --> 36:17.889
We'll grab what we can
and then be gone before
he blows his candles out.

36:17.971 --> 36:21.309
-I need your help, darling.
-Hiya.

36:23.519 --> 36:26.731
-Hi.
-Do you still want to
see around the place?

36:43.790 --> 36:46.292
LEXIE: Don't let
the dogs eat the food.

37:40.263 --> 37:42.056
You're very quiet.

37:44.142 --> 37:47.186
That's the pot
calling the kettle black.

37:47.270 --> 37:49.522
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

37:51.899 --> 37:54.861
Listen, thank you for
making my birthday...

37:55.862 --> 37:57.530
Well, different.

37:57.613 --> 38:01.784
Well, before you say anything,
there's something
you should know.

38:03.703 --> 38:05.663
It's about you and me.

38:08.082 --> 38:10.126
It would never work.

38:11.502 --> 38:14.464
Funny, I was going
to say the same thing.

38:14.547 --> 38:17.592
I mean, you're tied up
with running your estate

38:17.675 --> 38:21.429
and I'm tied up with mine.

38:25.224 --> 38:28.978
I thought you
were going to say
it was because of Katrina.

38:35.276 --> 38:37.945
Archie MacDonald,
you're crazy about that girl.

38:38.029 --> 38:40.490
What on earth
makes you say that?

38:45.286 --> 38:47.622
Take it from
someone who knows.

38:51.292 --> 38:55.129
Don't waste a chance
to be really happy
with a good person.

38:56.714 --> 38:59.008
It doesn't happen very often.

39:03.179 --> 39:06.182
Tell me you're not
in love with her.

39:06.265 --> 39:09.686
-I, erm...
-Surprise.

39:09.769 --> 39:13.314
- # Happy birthday to you... #
-Oh, no.

39:13.398 --> 39:15.692
-Did you know about this?
-Yes.

39:15.775 --> 39:19.028
So that's why you
spent a day with me,
keep me off the trail.

39:19.112 --> 39:22.573
No, I spent the day with
you because I wanted to.

39:22.657 --> 39:25.368
# Happy birthday to you #

39:25.451 --> 39:26.911
(ALL CHEERING)

39:26.994 --> 39:28.162
Thank you very much.

39:34.544 --> 39:36.838
DUNCAN: It'll be good fun.

39:36.921 --> 39:39.132
You like parties, don't you?

39:40.091 --> 39:43.511
Wow. Is that the new series?

39:44.762 --> 39:47.098
-Like cars, do you?
-Yeah.

39:47.181 --> 39:50.143
Uh-uh.
That'll be one of the guests.

39:50.226 --> 39:53.312
Best not to touch.
Go to the party.

39:53.396 --> 39:55.440
You said I
should ask questions.

39:55.523 --> 39:58.276
Has it got a V8 engine?

39:58.359 --> 40:02.071
I don't suppose it
would do any harm
to have a wee look.

40:02.155 --> 40:03.906
No touching, mind.

40:16.377 --> 40:19.130
LEXIE: Enjoying yourself,
Arch? ARCHIE:
Oh, Lexie, thank you so much.

40:19.213 --> 40:20.548
Can't thank you enough.

40:20.631 --> 40:22.300
Cake's wonderful.

40:24.093 --> 40:26.888
See? She's already
part of the family.

40:27.889 --> 40:30.350
She's only been here one day.

40:30.433 --> 40:33.269
She looks pretty
much in there to me.

40:33.353 --> 40:37.440
But we all know
what a sucker Archie is
for a pretty face, eh?

40:40.234 --> 40:42.070
HECTOR:
So, where's your father?

40:42.153 --> 40:44.280
Oh, he has a slight headache.

40:44.364 --> 40:45.823
He said he'd join us later.

40:45.907 --> 40:49.077
Splendid. Well,
here's to new beginnings, eh?

40:49.160 --> 40:51.204
New beginnings.

40:51.287 --> 40:54.874
I know you didn't want a fuss,
Archie, but I couldn't help
thinking about the past.

40:54.957 --> 40:59.128
Do you remember?
All the parties here,
children, Lizzie?

40:59.212 --> 41:01.798
Jamie would've loved this.

41:01.881 --> 41:04.217
I don't think you realise,
Archie,

41:04.300 --> 41:08.262
how lucky and proud
I feel to have you,
birthday boy.

41:08.346 --> 41:10.640
Thank you very much, Mother.

41:25.071 --> 41:27.824
Might've one of
these myself one day.

41:27.907 --> 41:30.827
I'm sure a bright lad like you
will be able to have one, too.

41:30.910 --> 41:34.163
Oh, don't touch that.
That's the ejector button!

41:50.763 --> 41:54.142
-You scared
the wits out of me.
-Have you no shame?

41:54.225 --> 41:57.854
-I can't afford shame.
-This is wrong.

41:57.937 --> 42:00.982
Look, the lad's dead.
He has no use for this stuff.

42:01.065 --> 42:03.109
These trophies
aren't worth much.

42:08.531 --> 42:10.324
This is more like it.

42:10.408 --> 42:14.287
I have done my best
for you for 10 years,
but I can't let you do this.

42:15.955 --> 42:17.623
Look at you, Dad.

42:18.958 --> 42:21.169
Look at what you've become.

42:24.505 --> 42:26.215
Oh, thanks, Lexie.

42:41.814 --> 42:45.318
Just tell me you're not
seriously thinking about it.

42:45.401 --> 42:46.944
About what?

42:47.028 --> 42:50.948
Come on. Arranged marriages.

42:51.032 --> 42:53.242
You don't really believe
in all that stuff, do you?

42:53.326 --> 42:57.705
I've only just met her.
For what it's worth,
I think she's all right.

42:59.749 --> 43:01.084
All right?

43:03.670 --> 43:06.297
And besides,
whatever goes on
between me and Tanya,

43:06.381 --> 43:09.175
or anyone else for that
matter, is my business.

43:13.137 --> 43:15.264
It's always been the same,
hasn't it?

43:15.348 --> 43:17.433
"You wouldn't let
your old man down now,
would you?"

43:17.517 --> 43:19.519
"Just one more job
and I'll be set."

43:19.602 --> 43:23.439
Please, just... Let's just go.
We can't take any of this.

43:23.523 --> 43:25.024
It's too late.

43:42.583 --> 43:44.711
Get away from my car.

43:46.004 --> 43:47.714
What's going on?

44:04.147 --> 44:07.734
Get away. Get away.
Get away from my car!

44:12.280 --> 44:15.158
(CAR HONKING)

44:27.337 --> 44:29.213
(DOGS BARKING)

44:43.644 --> 44:45.688
Where are you going, Dad?

44:49.317 --> 44:51.569
Where are you running to now?

44:56.157 --> 44:58.242
What's going on, old chap?

45:31.401 --> 45:34.862
-A real bright spark that lad.
-Takes one to know one.

45:37.281 --> 45:40.159
Come on, the party's over.

46:43.473 --> 46:46.934
I tried to tell you.
Before the party.

46:47.935 --> 46:50.313
Yeah, I know. Why?

46:53.649 --> 46:56.652
Because, believe it or not,
I really like you.

46:58.071 --> 46:59.781
I like all of you.

47:03.868 --> 47:08.414
He is my father, Archie.
It's the family business.

47:08.498 --> 47:12.919
You understand that, trying to
make the family
business work, don't you?

47:13.002 --> 47:16.881
-I'm gonna have
to call the police.
-It's all right, Archie.

47:19.217 --> 47:23.805
Let them go.
We've been disturbed
enough by you people.

47:23.888 --> 47:27.600
-Jamie's been
disturbed enough.
-Thank you, Mr MacDonald.

47:33.314 --> 47:35.066
Thank you, Archie.

47:45.618 --> 47:48.287
-Archie...
-Don't gloat.

47:48.371 --> 47:50.415
I'm not.

47:50.498 --> 47:52.458
That man is impossible.

48:05.304 --> 48:07.849
-You all right, Father?
-I'm fine.

48:07.932 --> 48:10.018
I'm sorry your
party was spoiled.

48:10.101 --> 48:13.021
Oh, well.
At least that's my birthday
over for another year.

48:13.104 --> 48:15.106
Not quite.

48:17.608 --> 48:23.031
This is to remind
you that you were once
a little boy, my little boy.

48:23.114 --> 48:25.450
Your very own red Porsche.

48:28.828 --> 48:32.707
-Couldn't afford
the real thing.
-Oh, Mother, it's perfect.

48:35.626 --> 48:39.297
I'm sorry I interfered,
Archie. I wish you all
the luck in the world.

48:39.380 --> 48:43.801
I hope you find someone who
makes you as happy as your
mother makes me.

48:43.885 --> 48:45.303
Thank you.

48:52.769 --> 48:57.732
I was just trying to tell him
that I was sorry things
didn't work out with Tanya,

48:57.815 --> 48:59.776
but he wouldn't listen.

49:03.696 --> 49:07.283
-What's so funny?
-Just you and Archie.

49:08.576 --> 49:11.329
Always seem to be
upsetting each other.

49:13.831 --> 49:18.419
Yeah, well, he can be
a very upsetting person.

49:20.922 --> 49:25.551
LEXIE: Ready, steady, go.

49:25.635 --> 49:28.930
And they're off! And he's off.
Can you believe it?

49:30.973 --> 49:34.894
He's round the tunnel,
he's in the tunnel.
And he's over the hill.

49:34.977 --> 49:36.938
(ALL CHATTERING)

49:37.021 --> 49:38.523
Come on!

49:38.606 --> 49:40.233
That one's got
headlights that go on!

49:47.156 --> 49:48.616
I better go.

49:54.664 --> 49:56.332
I'll see you soon.
