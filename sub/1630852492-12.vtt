Is that okay?
- That's okay, mama.

18:46.926 --> 18:49.026
- I think it's okay, too.

19:02.408 --> 19:04.575
- She's fine, but...

19:04.611 --> 19:07.044
But she was scared
to come to me.

19:08.847 --> 19:10.915
Oh, I hate myself.
- No.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.583
- Yes, it's not a turn
of phrase.

19:12.718 --> 19:14.418
I hate... Myself.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.454
- Stop it!

19:16.589 --> 19:19.157
- I've been thinking
about what you said.

19:19.292 --> 19:21.325
Do you ever feel like
our friendship

19:21.460 --> 19:23.427
Is like this time capsule?

19:24.564 --> 19:27.331
Built on ideas that
don't serve us anymore?

19:29.102 --> 19:31.135
It's like we've been feeding
each other this steady diet

19:31.204 --> 19:33.471
Of poison for a really
long time.

19:35.308 --> 19:37.341
- Okay.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.411
- You know how I said

19:41.447 --> 19:43.880
That anything in life
worth doing is--

19:43.917 --> 19:46.150
- Fucking scary and going
to hurt?

19:46.219 --> 19:47.351

19:55.494 --> 19:57.828
To figure out who I am
without you.

19:57.830 --> 20:00.164
- Jesus!

20:00.233 --> 20:01.699
Do you--

20:01.768 --> 20:03.234
Do you mean that?

20:03.303 --> 20:06.971
- If this friendship has...
Has run its course,

20:06.973 --> 20:09.707
You know, or-or served its
purpose,

20:10.944 --> 20:12.576
Then maybe that's okay.

20:13.646 --> 20:16.714
Maybe letting go of it
could be like,

20:16.783 --> 20:18.716
A celebration.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.852
- It doesn't feel like
a celebration.

20:23.322 --> 20:24.522
- But you don't disagree.
