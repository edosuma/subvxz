WEBVTT

00:12.762 --> 00:14.806
(distant traffic noise)

00:19.102 --> 00:21.104
(fluorescent lights buzzing)

00:22.355 --> 00:23.815
Lt. Donnie Kee:
Grab your long guns

00:23.857 --> 00:25.150
and line up real quick.

00:26.109 --> 00:27.402
Got to get it right.

00:28.361 --> 00:29.446
Go.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.658
Nice and slow, no rush.

00:36.453 --> 00:37.537
Good.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.040
Remember,
we're looking for efficiency,

00:40.373 --> 00:42.375
because once gunfire starts,

00:42.459 --> 00:44.669
this is gonna
happen automatically.

00:44.961 --> 00:45.962
See what's in his hands, right?

00:46.004 --> 00:48.173
If he needs it,
pow, pow, right here.

00:48.631 --> 00:51.051
So there's all kinds of
different ways to do this shit.

00:51.551 --> 00:54.679
The best way is the way that
you don't get shot in the face,

00:54.721 --> 00:55.805
so you have to be--

00:55.847 --> 00:56.973
Antwan Gray:
As an officer,

00:57.015 --> 00:59.392
you have to protect yourself,

00:59.934 --> 01:01.853
but I'm the type
that will actually

01:01.895 --> 01:05.022
try to calm
the situation down,

01:05.815 --> 01:08.193
and I just told my wife, like,
"If it gets to that point,

01:08.234 --> 01:10.195
I will take a bullet
for somebody."

01:12.739 --> 01:15.784
Kevin Gray:
Alright guys, bow your heads.

01:15.992 --> 01:18.203
Father God, we come
before you this evening.

01:18.620 --> 01:21.206
I pray for my son, that
You would continue to help him

01:21.247 --> 01:24.250
and guide him and lead him
into truth, Lord God,

01:24.334 --> 01:26.294
each and every day,
Lord God.

01:26.461 --> 01:27.379
Give him courage

01:27.712 --> 01:30.548
and be with our
family members here, Lord God.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.759
In Jesus' mighty name,
everybody said...

01:33.843 --> 01:35.595
-Group: Amen.
-Kevin: Amen.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.182
Yes, go ahead.
You guys go first.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.769
Yeah, the guest
always go first.

01:42.852 --> 01:45.146
(people chattering)

01:45.771 --> 01:48.650
Kevin: Back in the day,
I just hated cops.

01:49.901 --> 01:53.238
They would always come by
every time my dad was drunk,

01:53.279 --> 01:54.906
or my mom,
or they were fighting,

01:54.989 --> 01:59.285
and it's like, "Oh, the cops
took your mom and parents."

01:59.369 --> 02:00.912
And that hatred kinda...

02:00.995 --> 02:02.247
(stammers)

02:02.330 --> 02:04.290
"These guys are just
breaking up my family."

02:05.583 --> 02:06.835
(clears throat)

02:06.918 --> 02:08.627
(people chattering and laughing)

02:08.711 --> 02:11.840
Currinda Gray: We had Antwan
senior year of high school,

02:12.257 --> 02:15.260
and I think just being
a young Native girl,

02:15.301 --> 02:18.096
I had to deal
with the stigma

02:18.138 --> 02:21.933
of being a teen mom
on the reservation,

02:22.017 --> 02:24.310
like, I was gonna be another...

02:25.603 --> 02:27.188
statistic.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.066
Kevin:
There were just struggles, man,

02:30.108 --> 02:32.569
just trying to make it
on our own,

02:32.610 --> 02:34.863
and things started
falling apart.

02:35.071 --> 02:36.406
I was drinking
and I was selling drugs.

02:36.448 --> 02:39.659
I was kinda just being
no good, man.

02:41.661 --> 02:44.039
Currinda: One morning,
you know, I had had it,

02:44.329 --> 02:46.624
and I told him,
"We have three sons,

02:46.708 --> 02:50.337
and I don't want that kind
of example for them."

02:51.755 --> 02:54.299
Kevin: I just got tired
of hurting my family,

02:54.341 --> 02:57.886
and that morning, I wanted
to commit suicide,

02:57.969 --> 03:00.638
so I came here
to Pastor Artie

03:00.680 --> 03:03.641
to repair a lot of things
that were broken.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.269
(poignant music playing)

03:06.311 --> 03:11.733
(inaudible singing)

03:15.445 --> 03:16.821
Antwan:
It took a while,

03:16.905 --> 03:19.157
but he's way different

03:19.199 --> 03:20.575
from when I was growing up.

03:21.659 --> 03:24.954
He started becoming a godly man
for this church

03:24.996 --> 03:26.498
and he started to change,

03:26.539 --> 03:29.668
so my dad's always been
an inspiration to me.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.797
Kevin: I'm like, "Man, I used
to run from cops, man."

03:33.838 --> 03:35.924
-(Currinda laughing)
-Kevin: "But my son's
becoming a cop."

03:35.965 --> 03:37.716
I was like,
"Wow, that's a trip."

03:38.009 --> 03:40.261
But then again, it's like,
"Oh, that's cool, man."

03:40.345 --> 03:42.847
So it's really--
I think it's cool.

03:42.930 --> 03:44.349
-Shoot
-Currinda: Mm-hmm.

03:45.016 --> 03:48.395
To see him being
this far along in the academy,

03:48.478 --> 03:52.732
so close to graduating,
we're very proud of him.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.860
But the crime,

03:55.902 --> 03:59.364
the violence that
he's gonna be dealing with,

03:59.948 --> 04:01.700
it's scary.

04:01.741 --> 04:02.617
(indistinct chatter)

04:02.701 --> 04:04.119
Antwan:
I told my wife, like,

04:04.202 --> 04:06.037
"This job's gonna
be dangerous,

04:06.705 --> 04:10.208
but if it means me giving up
my life, I'll do it."

04:10.875 --> 04:13.086
And she just asked me,
"Why would you do that?"

04:13.169 --> 04:15.338
And I said,
"Because, like, you never know,

04:16.130 --> 04:17.673
it could change somebody."

04:19.134 --> 04:21.845
And I have faith
that things can change,

04:23.388 --> 04:24.597
I've seen it.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.810
(laughter)

04:29.686 --> 04:33.857
♪♪

04:44.868 --> 04:46.494
Attendant (over intercom):
Hi, how are you?

04:46.911 --> 04:49.164
-I'm good, how are you?
-Attendant: I'm good, thank you.

04:49.247 --> 04:50.915
What can we get
started on for ya?

04:51.249 --> 04:53.168
Can I get
a 16-ounce legendary?

04:53.710 --> 04:55.086
Attendant:
Yeah, and this is all today?

04:55.128 --> 04:56.087
Yes.

04:58.465 --> 05:02.052
At this point, we're beyond
50% attrition,

05:02.093 --> 05:04.346
and I had really hoped that
we were gonna be graduating

05:04.429 --> 05:06.306
more than 20 recruits
out of this class.

05:07.098 --> 05:09.851
Rob Williams and I were talking
about working the data,

05:09.934 --> 05:11.770
but I don't know that
that's gonna show us

05:11.853 --> 05:16.608
any specific reason
for losing so many recruits.

05:17.942 --> 05:19.861
Maybe if we start
with a class of 50,

05:19.944 --> 05:22.697
we'll graduate 25 to 20.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.409
Family issues, uh,
were the other ones

05:26.451 --> 05:29.079
that were related
to the recruits quitting.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.748
We had one recruit,
he had some child custody issues

05:31.790 --> 05:34.125
that did not go in his favor,
I'm guessing,

05:34.209 --> 05:36.002
um, and so that, that was what

05:36.086 --> 05:38.338
caused him to, uh,
go on his way.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.340
A, uh, preexisting--

05:40.423 --> 05:42.425
Ronald Silversmith:
As a Navajo police officer,

05:42.467 --> 05:45.845
you literally have
to live two worlds.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.556
Our young commanders have

05:48.640 --> 05:51.308
a more Western education,

05:51.351 --> 05:53.728
philosophy, uh, upbringing,

05:54.479 --> 05:58.983
but we still have
our fundamental laws,

05:59.025 --> 06:01.945
Diné fundamental,
you know, ways of life.

06:04.197 --> 06:08.159
A lot of our young generation,
they long for the language.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.745
Recruits that didn't grow up

06:10.829 --> 06:13.248
with Navajo
traditional teachings.

06:14.207 --> 06:18.420
That's really what's missing
from Navajo these days,

06:18.503 --> 06:20.630
is our culture
and our language.

06:21.006 --> 06:24.009
It's very rare
that you find an officer

06:24.050 --> 06:26.678
that's gonna talk
and understand Navajo.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.556
We used to live
in the traditional path,

06:29.639 --> 06:31.599
the Navajo way of life.

06:32.058 --> 06:37.022
(Drake Mace speaking Navajo)

06:37.564 --> 06:39.357
Drake Mace:
We do this every spring,

06:39.399 --> 06:41.526
always butcher goats or lambs.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.779
My late grandmother
taught us this way.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.324
It's best to have
your own flock,

06:48.366 --> 06:50.869
That way, you, like,
sustain your family

06:51.411 --> 06:52.871
for years to come.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.207
Wyndean Largo: It's more like
a monthly thing for us.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.917
(laughs)

06:58.001 --> 06:59.169
You get cravings.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.046
Drake:
During the ceremonial season,

07:01.129 --> 07:02.547
a lot of elders now,

07:02.881 --> 07:04.591
they always request
for people's assistance

07:04.674 --> 07:05.675
to help them butcher,

07:05.717 --> 07:08.053
because not many people
butcher no more.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.555
Yeah, we'll probably eat
in the hogan.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.475
Grandpa, can you, uh,
pray for the food?

07:13.725 --> 07:17.437
(Wyndean's Grandfather
speaking Navajo)

07:21.691 --> 07:23.443
Silversmith:
Our way of life is different

07:23.526 --> 07:25.737
from the Western culture.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.281
Our culture is always
about Hózhó,

07:28.365 --> 07:32.159
you know,
balance a-and harmony.

07:32.494 --> 07:35.080
At double-arm interval,
dress right, dress.

07:36.039 --> 07:38.166
Silversmith: We always think
of things as equal,

07:38.625 --> 07:41.127
as opposed
to who is more dominant.

07:42.712 --> 07:46.007
So if you put yourself equal

07:46.341 --> 07:47.717
to the people you serve

07:47.759 --> 07:49.969
and put yourself
in their shoes,

07:50.053 --> 07:52.055
then you have
a better understanding

07:52.097 --> 07:53.431
of where they come from

07:53.515 --> 07:54.974
and what they're experiencing.

07:55.933 --> 07:58.520
One of the things
I will always stress to my staff

07:58.603 --> 08:02.232
is accepting criticism
both ways.

08:02.273 --> 08:05.777
(speaking Navajo)

08:08.947 --> 08:10.990
(wind blowing)

08:12.617 --> 08:14.452
Sgt. Gary Franklin:
Two, empty gun reload, three.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.453
(device beeps)

08:15.745 --> 08:17.539
Get it up there,
get it up there.

08:17.956 --> 08:21.209
(gunfire)

08:22.043 --> 08:23.128
(device beeps)

08:25.755 --> 08:28.550
Four seconds over,
still taking too long.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.177
Sgt. Rob Williams: There's no
reason you all can't line it up

08:31.261 --> 08:32.804
and press one off easy, right?

08:34.054 --> 08:35.097
(device beeps)

08:35.974 --> 08:36.683
(gunshot)

08:36.765 --> 08:38.643
You're jerking
the trigger, dude.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.895
-(device beeps)
-Get on it, Nora, move.

08:44.482 --> 08:45.775
(gunshot)

08:47.402 --> 08:48.445
Come on in for a second.

08:49.154 --> 08:51.072
I don't know what can--
what more we can do.

08:51.322 --> 08:52.615
How can we get them
to apply it?

08:53.366 --> 08:56.828
They can apply it, it's just
they got to do it themselves.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.621
-Um, um--
-Sgt. Williams: Yeah, okay.
then let me ask you this.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.165
Is there anything else
you think we can do

09:00.206 --> 09:01.332
to help them at this point?

09:01.374 --> 09:02.792
Um...

09:02.834 --> 09:04.502
'Cause we can work with them,
work with them, work with them.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.212
We've been working
with them a lot,

09:06.296 --> 09:08.214
but are we missing something?

09:08.673 --> 09:11.343
Have we failed to provide them
something they need?

09:15.680 --> 09:17.974
(Sgt. Franklin speaking)

09:25.357 --> 09:27.734
Sgt. Williams: We just need
to know if there's things
we need to change,

09:27.817 --> 09:30.653
because we don't see things from
the same level you see things.

09:30.987 --> 09:34.240
You know? So, what do we need
to do more of,

09:34.324 --> 09:35.742
or what should we do less of

09:36.076 --> 09:38.328
to make the next class
even better?

09:42.165 --> 09:43.249
(clears throat)

09:44.876 --> 09:47.712
I think what got most of
the recruits to leave this class

09:47.796 --> 09:52.592
was pretty much...
getting beat down on

09:52.967 --> 09:54.761
most of the time,
if that makes sense.

09:55.220 --> 09:58.556
But then again,
that's-that's-that's what
the academy is all about.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.393
Oh, you chicken shit,
get off the fucking fence.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.811
(both chuckle)

10:03.061 --> 10:04.270
Be honest, dude.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.231
-Because remember,
this is for the next class.
-Yes, sir.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.899
Sgt. Williams:
If people aren't honest with us,

10:07.941 --> 10:09.734
the program's
never gonna improve.

10:10.193 --> 10:11.778
You know, so if people
are just like, "Oh, yeah,

10:11.861 --> 10:12.904
you guys are doing great,
you're doing great."

10:12.946 --> 10:14.072
We're like,
"Fuck, we're doing great,

10:14.155 --> 10:15.407
we're gonna keep doing
what we're doing."

10:15.490 --> 10:17.867
And it isn't us,
because sometimes it's us.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.078
You know,
we got to self-assess.

10:20.578 --> 10:21.913
So, of the ones who left,

10:22.122 --> 10:25.208
d-do you think they had met
the standard?

10:25.250 --> 10:26.167
Pretty much, yeah.

10:26.251 --> 10:27.544
Sgt. Williams:
You felt, you felt they did?

10:27.585 --> 10:29.170
I thought-- Um...

10:29.254 --> 10:30.422
some people did, yes.

10:30.505 --> 10:32.632
They exceeded the standard,

10:32.716 --> 10:35.176
and-and I thought
they would make, um,

10:35.719 --> 10:37.554
outstanding officers,
you know?

10:38.013 --> 10:39.431
Sgt. Williams:
They were having trouble dealing

10:39.472 --> 10:41.933
with kind of the-the negative--

10:42.017 --> 10:43.768
Wyndean: I would say it was
putting in a lot of work,

10:43.810 --> 10:45.645
and it's been like,
"That's not enough."

10:46.146 --> 10:47.313
Sgt. Williams:
So what are you saying?

10:47.397 --> 10:49.941
Like, we should lighten up
a little bit, or...?

10:51.317 --> 10:54.446
Maybe just a little bit
but towards the halfway point,

10:54.863 --> 10:57.115
like, a-after you guys pass
halfway through the academy,

10:57.198 --> 10:59.951
you kinda like, okay,
start building them up more.

11:00.118 --> 11:01.953
-Sgt. Williams: Okay.
-Because...

11:02.704 --> 11:05.373
majority of the recruits,
I would say,

11:06.207 --> 11:08.335
growing up, that's all
they hear. It's like...

11:09.961 --> 11:11.296
-Sgt. Williams: Mm-hmm.
-So...

11:12.297 --> 11:15.216
if they hear the opposite
of that, it's pretty much...

11:17.844 --> 11:18.970
If that makes sense.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.097
Oh, yeah, it absolutely
makes sense.

11:21.556 --> 11:23.183
It absolutely makes sense.

11:24.059 --> 11:25.810
Yeah.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.854
Can I just check
something real quick?

11:28.980 --> 11:30.398
Why are you guys
not wearing body armor?

11:31.107 --> 11:33.026
You're not in trouble for it.
I understand the class,

11:33.109 --> 11:35.070
you don't have to wear it,
but you guys are recruits,

11:35.153 --> 11:36.821
so I want you getting used
to wearing the body armor.

11:36.863 --> 11:37.989
Class:
Yes, sir.

11:38.031 --> 11:38.990
Everybody understands,
you're not

11:39.032 --> 11:39.908
in trouble for it, right?

11:39.991 --> 11:41.409
-Class: Yes, sir.
-Okay.

11:41.659 --> 11:42.952
Sgt. Lucy Dan:
Go.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.122
Sgt. Williams:
Sprint it out.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.500
Sgt. Dan:
Go! Come on, Allen!

11:48.540 --> 11:50.377
(gunfire)

11:50.877 --> 11:53.838
Lt. Kee: That's how you do it.
You're capable of this here,

11:54.130 --> 11:57.050
you're capable
of hitting there at 25.

11:57.509 --> 11:59.386
Have some confidence
in yourself.

12:00.178 --> 12:01.763
-Sgt. Williams:
You know how to do this.
-Antwan: Yes, sir.

12:01.846 --> 12:04.641
Sgt. Williams:
You're just worried, 'cause
you're sitting next to me,

12:04.683 --> 12:07.352
but I know
you're going to do fine,

12:07.727 --> 12:10.355
so get out there
and be Antwan the cop.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.065
Antwan:
Antwan Gray.

12:12.273 --> 12:16.528

12:16.695 --> 12:18.363
Uh, I'm from
the Chinle district.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.949
Sgt. Williams: Good job on
the traditional introduction.

12:21.199 --> 12:23.118
When-- we think we got
a little lazy with that

12:23.201 --> 12:24.994
because we all know
each other.

12:25.036 --> 12:27.414
(Silversmith speaking Navajo)

12:27.664 --> 12:28.873
Sgt. Williams:
But let's not forget,

12:28.915 --> 12:30.250
that's a really
important component

12:30.333 --> 12:33.753
to establishing rapport
with the people.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.463
Silversmith: There you go.
(speaking Navajo)

12:35.839 --> 12:36.756
Sgt. Dan:

12:36.840 --> 12:38.008

Go. Come on, Allen.

12:38.049 --> 12:39.718
Sgt. Dan:
Come on, Allen!

12:39.759 --> 12:40.719
11:88.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.971
-Holy shit.
-So much better.

12:43.722 --> 12:44.764
Come on, Levi!

Come on, Levi, come on.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.695
It was fast and it was accurate.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.905
Sgt. Dan:
All the feelings that we get,

13:00.947 --> 13:02.657
being a police officer,

13:02.991 --> 13:04.784
they're all natural,

13:05.201 --> 13:07.537
but to balance out the sadness

13:07.579 --> 13:10.081
or the stress
of what we encounter,

13:10.165 --> 13:13.251
we still have our ways
that we cope with it.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.586

Keep it there, keep it there.

What we need from you,

22:38.316 --> 22:39.484
especially when
we're dealing with people

22:39.526 --> 22:42.487
who might have
self-esteem issues maybe,

22:42.570 --> 22:46.491
or issues in-in their ability
to do things,

22:46.866 --> 22:50.161
and then they succeed,
that's something.

22:50.203 --> 22:51.246
Uh, sorry.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.873
It's just, it's neat
to see that growth...

22:55.000 --> 22:57.293
and like, "Look at you go,"
you know?

22:57.335 --> 23:02.549
♪♪

23:08.596 --> 23:10.181
Handshakes or hugs, guys,
come on.

23:10.265 --> 23:11.433
Let's give them--

23:11.516 --> 23:13.935
(audience applauding)

23:29.576 --> 23:30.618
Stephanie Sanisya:
Hello, everyone,

23:30.702 --> 23:32.996
I just want to thank you
for coming out.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.373
We're here
to celebrate Shawvan.

23:35.415 --> 23:39.586
(applause)

23:43.590 --> 23:44.966
Shawvan:
Thank you, thank you.

23:48.386 --> 23:49.971
(Shawvan chuckles)

23:50.055 --> 23:50.805
Okay, then.

23:50.889 --> 23:52.557
Did you guys see
the cake yet, Mom?

23:54.392 --> 23:55.685
Okay.

24:05.445 --> 24:09.157
I'm gonna put on my uniform,
like, in 45 minutes.

24:09.574 --> 24:11.493
At academy,
they stress to us

24:11.534 --> 24:14.537
that we're gonna have
to live two separate lives,

24:15.372 --> 24:17.540
'cause when you're on work,
your senses are always going

24:17.582 --> 24:19.167
to have to be heightened,

24:19.626 --> 24:22.128
but when you're at home,
you can finally calm down

24:22.212 --> 24:23.755
and enjoy people's company.

24:23.797 --> 24:25.715
-...to head on out from here.
-Stephanie: Yeah.

24:25.757 --> 24:28.677
-(loud pop)
-Oh, jeez. What was...

24:28.927 --> 24:31.262
-Shawvan: A balloon.
-Stephanie: Oh. (chuckles)

24:32.597 --> 24:33.723
Shawvan:
It's just gonna be tough

24:33.765 --> 24:35.600
to keep those lives separated,

24:35.684 --> 24:38.103
because everyone knows
each other

24:38.144 --> 24:39.437
on the Navajo Nation.

24:40.313 --> 24:43.900
People are not going to be
the same around you anymore,

24:43.942 --> 24:46.444
like they used to be,
because you're an officer,

24:46.945 --> 24:50.281
and you start to kinda,
in a way, burn bridges.

24:50.949 --> 24:52.325
I'm just kinda thinking
about how

24:52.409 --> 24:54.494
the first day's gonna
go now.

24:56.663 --> 24:58.039
(Stephanie speaking)

25:00.583 --> 25:02.127
(Shawvan speaking)

25:15.974 --> 25:16.933
Yeah.

25:19.269 --> 25:20.395
Shawvan:
Is everything okay?

25:20.687 --> 25:22.981
(family member speaking)

25:30.238 --> 25:31.656
(Shawvan speaking)

25:37.495 --> 25:39.748
(family member speaking)

25:47.047 --> 25:49.132
(Shawvan speaking)

25:51.092 --> 25:53.178
(family member speaking)

25:56.014 --> 25:58.516
(Shawvan speaking)

25:58.600 --> 26:00.852
(family member speaking)

26:05.732 --> 26:07.692
Stephanie:
Hey, you got to go to work.

26:07.776 --> 26:09.027
Hello, everybody.

26:09.110 --> 26:11.654
So unfortunately,
he does work tonight,

26:11.988 --> 26:14.032
so he's getting ready
right now.

26:14.115 --> 26:16.868
As soon as we're done
cutting the cake, uh...

26:16.951 --> 26:20.205
(Stephanie continues, muffled)

26:26.753 --> 26:27.879
Shawvan:
Okay.

26:35.762 --> 26:38.056
(speaking indistinctly)

26:43.603 --> 26:48.566
Shawvan: I can't express
how grateful I am

26:48.608 --> 26:51.194
for each and every one of you.

26:51.236 --> 26:53.488
It is kind of a scary thing
to go into,

26:53.571 --> 26:56.908
but I am excited
to start my first day today.

26:58.201 --> 26:59.244
And...

27:01.746 --> 27:05.375
yeah, I mean, (clears throat)
like they said, everyone--

27:05.834 --> 27:09.045
not everybody will be there
to support me,

27:09.087 --> 27:11.756
not everybody will be there
to fight with me,

27:13.258 --> 27:15.885
but one thing is...

27:19.889 --> 27:22.267
you guys will all stand
behind me.

27:28.023 --> 27:31.693
Brandon Jim:
Shawvan Levi, let's see here.

27:31.776 --> 27:33.778
That badge number, 187,
sounds familiar.

27:33.862 --> 27:35.447
It sounds like it was
in a movie or something.

27:35.530 --> 27:38.950
Shawvan:
It's a terrible, terrible thing.

27:39.409 --> 27:41.953
Brandon:
Isn't that a flight 187?

27:42.620 --> 27:44.289
The, uh... 9/11?

27:44.539 --> 27:47.792
Shawvan: Uh, well,
what Sergeant Williams
told me was that...

27:49.502 --> 27:51.171
Brandon: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah,
that's right, that's right.

27:51.254 --> 27:53.214
Shawvan: Sergeant Williams
and them were just like...

27:55.592 --> 27:57.969
Brandon:
Jeez. Y'ello?

27:58.678 --> 28:00.388
Ah, jeez. Um...

28:02.098 --> 28:03.350
Alrighty.

28:03.767 --> 28:05.393
Well, we got our first call.

28:08.063 --> 28:11.316
-(tense music playing)
-(dogs barking)

28:13.568 --> 28:15.070
Shawvan:
Can you sit up?

28:15.320 --> 28:16.446
You need help sitting up?

28:16.488 --> 28:19.407
(indistinct background chatter)

28:20.450 --> 28:21.451
So, what happened?

28:21.493 --> 28:23.036
Looks like you have
some bloodstains

28:23.119 --> 28:25.705
on your shirt,
and your shirt's torn.

28:34.923 --> 28:37.175
(Brandon speaking)

28:42.472 --> 28:44.140
Just wait right here,
alright?

28:44.182 --> 28:45.308
Man:
Alright.

28:50.355 --> 28:53.024
Man: Yeah, that's the guy
that tried to kill me.

28:54.526 --> 28:56.778
(stretcher creaking)

28:57.862 --> 28:59.698
Sgt. Williams:
Officers on the road experience

28:59.781 --> 29:01.074
just horrible stuff.

29:01.574 --> 29:04.285
It can be
absolutely devastating.

29:09.249 --> 29:11.042
Officer 1: Everybody have
their seatbelt on or no?

29:11.209 --> 29:13.378
-Speaker: Mm-mm.
-Officer 1: No, nobody?

29:13.420 --> 29:14.546
Alright.

29:14.754 --> 29:18.633
(person screaming in pain)

29:18.717 --> 29:21.219
-Officer 1: Watch it.
-(baby crying)

29:21.261 --> 29:22.429
Officer 1:
Got it?

29:24.889 --> 29:25.974
Baby was in the car too.

29:26.057 --> 29:27.559
Baby wasn't restrained.

29:29.936 --> 29:31.021
Sgt. Williams: When they start
seeing the things

29:31.062 --> 29:32.731
that occur in the field,

29:32.814 --> 29:34.315
you become a different person.

29:35.150 --> 29:38.111
Sometimes it's boom,
one day, i-it just all clicks

29:38.194 --> 29:39.362
and there's a transformation,

29:39.404 --> 29:41.531
and other times
it's very, it's very gradual.

29:41.573 --> 29:43.908
Turn your vehicle off
and step out for me, please.

29:43.992 --> 29:45.577
Man 2: Fucking, bitch.
You know who I am?

29:45.618 --> 29:46.870
Nora:
Stop.

29:47.454 --> 29:48.663
Do not hit me.

29:48.747 --> 29:50.957
Man 2:
Fuck you, bitch whore.

29:51.416 --> 29:56.254
Fucking whore.
Smack your fucking face, bitch.

29:57.005 --> 29:59.090
Sgt. Williams: They will
continue to change and evolve,

29:59.174 --> 30:00.675
and not always
for the better.

30:00.759 --> 30:02.552
-(siren wailing)
-Antwan: Oh, shoot.

30:03.011 --> 30:05.138
Officer 1: I want you to take
a deep breath, relax...

30:07.474 --> 30:10.352
and just focus on what
you're gonna do next.

30:10.435 --> 30:14.272
(siren wailing)

30:16.441 --> 30:19.152
(light breeze blowing)

30:31.289 --> 30:35.126
(dogs barking)

30:35.960 --> 30:37.462
(knocking on door)

30:39.506 --> 30:41.216
Hello.

30:41.299 --> 30:42.634
You called
the police department

30:42.676 --> 30:43.802
saying you didn't want
someone here.

30:43.843 --> 30:45.053
What's going on?

30:45.804 --> 30:49.474
Well, I trying
to tell him, "Stop it."

30:51.226 --> 30:53.103
Nora: Stop what?
What was he doing to you?

30:53.770 --> 30:54.938
Like--

30:56.815 --> 31:00.777
Like, just... thinking that...

31:01.236 --> 31:05.323
he could control me,
the way I would talk.

31:08.159 --> 31:11.454
Nora: Is this verbal?
Is it physical? What's going on?

31:12.205 --> 31:13.123
Verbal.

31:13.373 --> 31:15.291
Nora: Okay,
so you guys are okay now?

31:15.667 --> 31:17.002
-Mm-hmm.
-Nora: Okay.

31:17.043 --> 31:18.712
Alright, we're just checking
on you, okay?

31:19.004 --> 31:20.714
-Okay.
-Nora: Anything else happens,

31:20.797 --> 31:22.298
-call us back, alright?
-Okay.

31:22.340 --> 31:24.259
Nora: Okay, you have
a good day, ma'am.

31:26.344 --> 31:27.512
Sure you're alright?

31:30.974 --> 31:32.267
Woman:
Yeah.

31:32.976 --> 31:36.354
I'll call you
if I need any help later.

31:39.983 --> 31:41.151
Nora:
Okay.

31:42.360 --> 31:44.029
Alright, you have
a good evening, ma'am.

31:46.865 --> 31:48.908
It's like I'm trying
to help you here

31:48.992 --> 31:51.036
out of this
domestic violence situation,

31:51.119 --> 31:54.706
and they think it's-it's normal,
it's okay.

31:54.789 --> 31:56.791
My ex-husband,
he was that type,

31:56.875 --> 31:58.752
he-he was that person.

31:59.294 --> 32:04.674
That's how I know where
it's not gonna go anywhere,

32:04.841 --> 32:09.304
because if you really want
to get out of it,

32:09.387 --> 32:13.058
you'll do everything
in your power to make it happen.

32:13.391 --> 32:16.061
So, like, hey, you know,
you let her talk,

32:16.102 --> 32:18.063
you let her vent,
gave her her options.

32:18.104 --> 32:20.065
What more can you do?
Let it go.

32:20.398 --> 32:23.234
We have a next call waiting,
someone else needs help.

32:26.696 --> 32:28.907
Dispatcher 1: Alright,
and may I get your name, sir?

32:29.199 --> 32:30.658
Sgt. Eldon Foster:
Shiprock police department.

32:30.742 --> 32:33.286
(indistinct radio chatter)

32:34.746 --> 32:37.290
Roger 21, 10-4, 17-0-1.

32:38.833 --> 32:40.251
Our shift schedule was changed,

32:40.293 --> 32:44.839
and, uh, it leaves swing shift
with no dispatcher today,

32:44.923 --> 32:48.635
so myself and Pablo
are gonna have to sit in

32:48.718 --> 32:50.470
for the next eight hours.

32:50.804 --> 32:52.847
It is, it is what it is,

32:52.931 --> 32:55.058
but new officers
that are coming in,

32:55.100 --> 32:56.518
it helps out a whole lot.

32:56.643 --> 32:59.854
They're moving forward
with the FTO day by day.

33:00.313 --> 33:01.439
They're-- I think most of them,

33:01.481 --> 33:03.191
actually all of them
are in second phase now,

33:03.274 --> 33:06.236
so I'm-I'm proud of them,
I'm proud of them all.

33:07.320 --> 33:10.156
I want you all to be leaders.

33:10.240 --> 33:11.950
I want you all to-to thrive,

33:12.033 --> 33:13.702
to be the best
at your profession,

33:14.035 --> 33:17.080
and you all did that
with this first phase,

33:17.122 --> 33:19.416
and then now we're gonna
show you even more,

33:19.457 --> 33:22.043
because when you finish
this FTO program,

33:22.127 --> 33:24.170
you're gonna go
on a call by yourself,

33:24.587 --> 33:26.297
and you're gonna have
to take care of things

33:26.339 --> 33:28.299
by yourself, without backup.

33:28.383 --> 33:31.011
Your backup's gonna be
over an hour away.

33:31.720 --> 33:34.514
The only thing that we can do
is step up our game

33:34.597 --> 33:35.932
and think tactically.

33:35.974 --> 33:38.435
(indistinct radio chatter)

33:40.520 --> 33:41.229
Antwan:
Shoot.

33:41.312 --> 33:43.648
-(panting)
-(radio chirping)

33:47.694 --> 33:52.449
(indistinct radio chatter)

33:55.243 --> 33:57.996
Antwan: So there was
a whole bunch of riders and kids

33:58.038 --> 34:00.749
on top of the mesa,
riding on horses.

34:00.957 --> 34:04.252
I just had, uh,
three reports,

34:04.836 --> 34:07.297
a guy shooting
a rifle at them.

34:08.047 --> 34:11.760
(siren wailing)

34:16.473 --> 34:18.433
I guess there was
a female there too.

34:20.060 --> 34:23.480
He is armed,
so just stay behind us.

34:24.188 --> 34:27.567
(dogs barking)

34:28.275 --> 34:30.402
Officer 2 (over PA): This is
the Navajo Nation Police.

34:30.862 --> 34:32.781
Need you to come out
of the house

34:32.864 --> 34:34.491
with your hands up,

34:34.783 --> 34:37.202
visible, open, and empty.

34:39.996 --> 34:41.539
Antwan:
Show us your hands!

34:43.667 --> 34:44.833
Alright, turn around!

34:44.876 --> 34:46.252
Woman 2:
I'm not gonna turn around.

34:46.670 --> 34:49.047
-Antwan: Come towards me.
-Woman 2: I'm right here.

34:49.422 --> 34:51.382
Antwan: Cooperate with us
and come over here.

34:51.466 --> 34:54.010
You're coming onto my house,
and you're telling me this shit.

34:54.052 --> 34:55.887
-Antwan: Come over here.
-Woman 2: No.

34:55.929 --> 34:57.389
Antwan:
Can you grab her?

34:57.472 --> 34:58.640
I got you.

34:58.848 --> 35:01.476
-(dogs barking)
-(woman muttering)

35:02.977 --> 35:04.729
(Antwan panting)

35:05.689 --> 35:07.524
Oh, the door's opening,
door's opening.

35:08.483 --> 35:11.194
(Officer 2 speaking over PA)

35:15.323 --> 35:17.117
Turn around
and walk backwards.

35:19.327 --> 35:20.745
Antwan:
Alright, stop.

35:22.497 --> 35:24.666
You're gonna back up
until I tell you to stop.

35:24.749 --> 35:26.292
Do you understand?

35:26.376 --> 35:27.335
Move.

35:28.503 --> 35:29.754
Back, back.

35:30.547 --> 35:32.465
Keep going, keep going,
keep going, and stop.

35:32.549 --> 35:34.259
Officer 2: Stop. Put your hands
on your back for me, buddy.

35:34.300 --> 35:36.261
Man 3:
(indistinct) my family.

35:36.344 --> 35:38.805
Officer 3: Well, both of you are
gonna be equally charged.

35:39.389 --> 35:41.558
Woman 2: I mean,
nobody was hurt. That's how--

35:41.599 --> 35:43.768
Officer 3: It don't matter,
you're displaying a gun

35:43.852 --> 35:45.145
in front of kids.

35:45.478 --> 35:47.480
That's what
you don't understand.

35:47.772 --> 35:49.399
(shuts vehicle door)

35:51.818 --> 35:53.820
(coughing)

35:54.112 --> 35:55.947
This is the part
about this job...

35:56.197 --> 35:58.283
(clears throat)

35:58.324 --> 35:59.909
...your adrenaline's
way up there,

36:01.119 --> 36:03.621
but after this call,
after it settles down

36:03.705 --> 36:06.416
and it's just gonna go voom,
major crash,

36:06.458 --> 36:08.877
and you'll be, like, tired.

36:10.628 --> 36:12.630
So, like, right now,
I'm all, like, jittery.

36:12.672 --> 36:13.798
(chuckles)

36:14.382 --> 36:17.218
Officer (over radio):
31 Charlie 10-4... (indistinct)

36:17.260 --> 36:20.221
Antwan: Actually being
out there on the front lines

36:21.264 --> 36:23.558
and seeing what
people can do.

36:25.352 --> 36:27.604
Always, all these weapon calls
are what I was going to

36:27.645 --> 36:32.734
and people getting more guns,
getting out of control.

36:33.568 --> 36:36.613
My AR, I probably drew out
five times already

36:36.654 --> 36:39.491
and my duty weapon,
I don't know how many times,

36:39.574 --> 36:40.950
20 times?

36:48.291 --> 36:49.542
-Kid: Mom.
-Andrea Gray: What?

36:49.751 --> 36:50.710
Kid:
I got.

36:51.002 --> 36:52.003
Andrea:
Get the other one.

36:52.087 --> 36:53.546
Go get the other one.

36:55.382 --> 36:57.926
-Here.
-(kid speaks indistinctly)

36:59.135 --> 37:02.180
Antwan:
My wife is a strong woman.

37:02.263 --> 37:04.015
I say she's stronger than me.

37:06.685 --> 37:09.896
And through the tough times,
she's helped me.

37:12.023 --> 37:16.695
She tells me, "At home,
try not to think about work."

37:16.778 --> 37:18.154
That's what I try to do,

37:18.446 --> 37:21.700
but it's, it's a work
in progress...

37:22.742 --> 37:23.743
yeah.

37:23.827 --> 37:27.288
(gun clicking)

37:29.708 --> 37:33.003
Andrea: He's kind of...
he's getting better.

37:33.878 --> 37:40.010
He's slowly starting to try
not to bring work to home,

37:40.051 --> 37:42.846
but he still does
on some days.

37:42.887 --> 37:46.933
He'll come home, and he'll take
his anger out...

37:47.767 --> 37:49.561
like, on me.

37:49.644 --> 37:52.814
Like, I don't know what he's
getting mad about me for, like,

37:53.523 --> 37:55.984
but I'll just be like,

37:56.067 --> 37:57.736
"He's-- It's not you,

37:57.777 --> 38:00.280
it's what's
he's going through at work."

38:00.363 --> 38:02.365
(sniffles)

38:02.407 --> 38:04.117
Antwan:
I know it's changing me,

38:04.200 --> 38:07.537
just, like, um,
thinking of, like,

38:08.580 --> 38:10.415
just the things I've seen.

38:11.082 --> 38:12.292
Um...

38:14.252 --> 38:15.253
Come on, Ne-Ne.

38:15.670 --> 38:19.424
Especially if it
involves juveniles, kids.

38:20.717 --> 38:24.471
I had a kidnapping
and a sexual assault,

38:25.430 --> 38:28.475
and just hearing stories
about what people can do,

38:28.558 --> 38:30.143
what they're capable of.

38:30.226 --> 38:33.646
Um, it's gonna be
a problem for me.

38:34.898 --> 38:36.775
Like, the other night,
I had a dream

38:36.858 --> 38:39.402
about going to a situation
like that,

38:39.444 --> 38:41.363
but it was my family,

38:42.572 --> 38:46.743
and I didn't want to think
about stuff like that.

38:49.287 --> 38:51.664
Andrea: I think at one point
he woke up,

38:52.207 --> 38:55.377
and I heard him,
like, crying (sniffles)

38:55.460 --> 38:59.130
and couple minutes later

38:59.172 --> 39:01.174
I felt him crawl in by me,

39:01.257 --> 39:02.634
and...

39:05.637 --> 39:08.473
I-I see that he was scared.

39:10.475 --> 39:12.811
In a couple weeks,
he's gonna be by himself

39:12.852 --> 39:14.604
on calls, alone.

39:15.605 --> 39:17.357
That's what scares me,
is, like...

39:18.316 --> 39:19.859
how are you gonna
get help,

39:19.943 --> 39:23.446
or who's gonna come help you
when you're on your own?

39:24.322 --> 39:25.824
So, yeah, it scares me

39:25.907 --> 39:29.828
when he's about
to go on a call by himself.

39:41.381 --> 39:43.591
Sgt. Foster:
When I first went to academy,

39:43.675 --> 39:46.136
you would have people talking
about the change

39:46.177 --> 39:47.512
that officers are gonna
be going through

39:47.595 --> 39:49.180
once they start their career.

39:49.514 --> 39:53.810
But on the bright side,
you're here to protect life,

39:53.852 --> 39:56.062
you know, make sure that
the community is safe,

39:57.355 --> 39:59.190
build that trust
with them as well,

39:59.232 --> 40:01.151
so they'll know that
you'll be there

40:01.192 --> 40:02.861
when they call again.

40:02.944 --> 40:04.112
Hello, Mr. Fred?

40:05.113 --> 40:06.114
Sgt. Foster:
Yeah.

40:10.368 --> 40:12.454
Okay. Which-- Is it
at your house or--

40:12.537 --> 40:13.580
-Yeah.
-Sgt. Foster: Okay.

40:13.663 --> 40:15.457
-At, at my house.
-Sgt. Foster: Oh, okay.

40:18.001 --> 40:19.419
Okay. Did you ever get back,

40:19.502 --> 40:21.880
a call back for
that janitor position?

40:23.506 --> 40:24.716
Sgt. Foster:
Okay.

40:24.758 --> 40:26.676
Alright, Mr. Fred,
I remember your application,

40:26.718 --> 40:27.886
so let me check on that too

40:27.927 --> 40:29.554
and see what the status is
on that, okay?

40:29.637 --> 40:30.847
-Okay.
Sgt. Foster: Then I'll go
to your house,

40:30.889 --> 40:32.140
I'll talk to, uh,

40:32.223 --> 40:33.224
-the gentleman over there.
-Okay.

40:33.308 --> 40:35.393
(indistinct radio chatter)

40:35.477 --> 40:36.561
Sgt. Foster: I believe
we have one individual

40:36.603 --> 40:38.313
that's running away
from the residence.

40:38.730 --> 40:40.482
Let me see
if I can catch up to him.

40:41.232 --> 40:43.860
Hey, he disappeared for me
when I went behind the trailer,

40:44.861 --> 40:46.654
unless he double-backed
that way.

40:47.530 --> 40:48.740
Yeah, there he is.

40:49.908 --> 40:52.494
I could easily catch him,
but I-I just don't have

40:52.577 --> 40:53.912
a crime right now.

40:54.788 --> 40:56.998
I don't know how, how he could
run fast on that thing, man.

40:57.082 --> 41:00.585
That's a,
that's a pretty risky move.

41:00.627 --> 41:02.253
For a big guy,
he's got some legs.

41:02.337 --> 41:05.715
(laughs)

41:07.676 --> 41:09.010
Yeah, it's not worth it.

41:10.512 --> 41:11.930
He's gonna sober up,
which is fine.

41:12.138 --> 41:13.807
-Mr. Fred: Uh-huh.
-Let him sober up, Mr. Fred.

41:13.890 --> 41:15.350
-Mr. Fred: Okay.
-Sgt. Foster: Alright.

41:15.642 --> 41:17.394
And, uh, I hope
you get that job

41:17.435 --> 41:18.436
that you applied for.

41:18.478 --> 41:19.646
Mr. Fred:
Yeah.

41:20.605 --> 41:22.023
Sgt. Foster:
No problem, Mr. Fred.

41:23.024 --> 41:25.276
Yeah, there's a lot more
to policing

41:25.318 --> 41:27.278
than just applying force.

41:27.320 --> 41:29.614
You deal with
a variety of calls,

41:29.698 --> 41:31.366
and you always have
to be prepared,

41:31.658 --> 41:33.159
because you can't
predict people,

41:33.243 --> 41:34.411
you can't predict
their emotions,

41:34.452 --> 41:35.870
you can't predict
what they're gonna do.

41:36.746 --> 41:39.124
The best thing is just
to prepare for the worst.

41:41.459 --> 41:44.129
(wind gusting)

41:45.797 --> 41:47.298
-(phone buzzing)
-Shawvan: Hello?

41:48.591 --> 41:51.511
Yeah, uh, doing,
doing better.

41:56.558 --> 42:01.062
They said, um, like,
maybe Tuesday,

42:01.312 --> 42:04.441
but he said
he'd extend my days

42:04.482 --> 42:07.318
maybe at least
by another week, hopefully,

42:07.610 --> 42:09.029
'cause of the things
I was telling him

42:09.112 --> 42:10.321
about how I'm feeling,

42:10.405 --> 42:11.656
what I'm going through,
he's like,

42:11.698 --> 42:16.786
"Yeah, people go through
this job months, years,

42:16.828 --> 42:20.290
sometimes without even going
into an incident like that."

42:20.331 --> 42:23.001
(siren wailing)

42:23.084 --> 42:24.753
Tuesday of last week,

42:25.253 --> 42:27.213
it's just a normal day at work.

42:27.464 --> 42:31.134
Like, nothing really seemed
to be pointing

42:31.176 --> 42:33.720
as if something crazy
was gonna happen.

42:33.803 --> 42:35.764
(indistinct radio chatter)

42:35.847 --> 42:37.682
Dispatcher:
All units... (indistinct)

42:41.519 --> 42:43.855
Speaker:
He's in that trailer over there.

42:47.650 --> 42:51.696
(indistinct radio chatter)

42:51.780 --> 42:52.739
Officer:
Drop the gun!

42:52.822 --> 42:54.032
Shawvan:
Drop the gun!

42:55.033 --> 42:58.161
Female was shot,
and the guy

42:58.203 --> 43:00.830
who did it was still
at the residence.

43:00.872 --> 43:02.374
-Officer Drake: Drop it!
-Shawvan: And he still had

43:02.415 --> 43:03.958
the shotgun with him.

43:04.209 --> 43:06.586
Drop it! Stop right there!

43:08.505 --> 43:10.131
And all of a sudden,
he just kind of went

43:10.215 --> 43:11.549
straight up in the air

43:11.633 --> 43:12.967
and just shot off one round...

43:13.051 --> 43:14.427
(gunshot)

43:14.511 --> 43:16.179
...and cocked it back again.

43:16.388 --> 43:17.847
Drop the gun!

43:20.058 --> 43:22.227
-Shawvan: Stop right there!
-Officer Drake: Stop.

43:24.437 --> 43:25.897
It just felt kinda like
he was trying

43:25.939 --> 43:28.316
to attempt suicide by a cop.

43:32.612 --> 43:34.489
Shawvan:
Put it down! Stop right there!

43:34.572 --> 43:35.824
Officer Drake:
Stop right there!

43:35.907 --> 43:37.200
Shawvan:
Stay where you are!

43:37.242 --> 43:38.410
(gunshot)

43:39.119 --> 43:40.745
-Officer Drake: Drop the gun.
-(gunshot)

43:40.787 --> 43:42.914
-(gunshot)
-(indistinct shouting)

43:42.956 --> 43:44.249
Officer Simms:
Moving up, moving up!

43:44.290 --> 43:45.750
-Officer Drake: Drop the gun!
-Shawvan: Stay down!

43:45.792 --> 43:47.210
Officer Drake:
Put your hands behind your back.

43:47.252 --> 43:49.671
Hands behind your back!
Hands behind your back.

43:49.754 --> 43:52.966
Shawvan: Don't you move!
Don't you reach!

43:54.676 --> 43:56.052
Suspect:
Oh!

43:57.595 --> 43:58.763
(handcuffs click)

44:02.475 --> 44:03.685
Officer Simms:
Yeah.

44:06.062 --> 44:08.732
(kids squealing)

44:15.030 --> 44:16.823
-Kid: Daddy.
-Officer Drake: What, baby?

44:18.825 --> 44:20.493
But think of it
this way, though.

44:21.244 --> 44:24.080
We're at home, we're safe,
we're with our kids.

44:24.122 --> 44:26.666
You're with your girlfriend,
your family.

44:28.209 --> 44:29.419
Shawvan:
Yeah.

44:32.464 --> 44:35.300
(indistinct radio chatter)

44:41.723 --> 44:42.974
Shawvan:
I was going to.

44:44.392 --> 44:47.312
I pondered that thought
in my mind a lot,

44:47.645 --> 44:51.232
"Why didn't I discharge
my firearm as well?"

44:51.983 --> 44:56.237
The scary thing is,
if I were out there by myself,

44:56.321 --> 45:01.868
how far would I have let him
get close before discharging?

45:01.951 --> 45:04.788
-This one up here?
-Stephanie: Yeah, that's fine.

45:05.246 --> 45:08.833
Shawvan: If things didn't go
the way it did, who knows?

45:08.875 --> 45:12.796
I wouldn't be here putting up
decorations with Steph

45:12.837 --> 45:16.466
and looking forward
to, uh, the holidays coming up.

45:18.677 --> 45:20.011
-Sgt. Franklin: Levi.
-Shawvan: Yeah.

45:22.972 --> 45:24.307
-You okay?
-Shawvan: Yeah.

45:25.183 --> 45:26.309
Just, uh...

45:29.020 --> 45:31.022
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Sgt. Franklin: Just what?

45:32.440 --> 45:33.650
(Shawvan clears throat)

45:34.067 --> 45:36.528
Well, I don't know,
I mean, it's just, uh,

45:36.611 --> 45:38.780
kinda happened
pretty quick, so...

45:40.490 --> 45:42.492
Yeah.

45:42.534 --> 45:44.160
Stephanie:
When Shawvan came back,

45:44.202 --> 45:45.620
I could already tell,
like, something was

45:45.704 --> 45:47.497
really, really off.

45:48.206 --> 45:51.418
You know, I could hear it
in his voice, I could see it.

45:52.043 --> 45:55.171
He was kinda displaying,
like, forgetfulness.

45:55.547 --> 45:59.134
You'll be just talking to him,
and he would just be blank.

45:59.551 --> 46:01.845
He was having,
like, nightmares.

46:01.886 --> 46:05.807
(sniffles) He just started
yelling in his sleep.

46:07.434 --> 46:11.021
I googled what resources
there are, and sure enough,

46:11.062 --> 46:14.858
the symptoms he's displaying,
it could turn into PTSD.

46:14.899 --> 46:16.234
Shawvan:
Yeah.

46:19.195 --> 46:21.197
Shawvan: That's what,
uh, Steph says too,

46:21.239 --> 46:24.534
because of all the things
that she goes through with me.

46:26.036 --> 46:28.913
They're wanting me
to come back quickly,

46:28.955 --> 46:31.249
"Because we want
to get you out solo."

46:31.291 --> 46:33.168
Oh, jeez.

46:33.251 --> 46:37.130
So they shortened
my leave because

46:37.213 --> 46:39.090
"You didn't discharge
your weapon."

46:39.382 --> 46:42.010
Stephanie: I know
he didn't fire his weapon,

46:42.093 --> 46:45.764
but still, he witnessed
the same thing

46:45.847 --> 46:47.849
that the two
other officers did.

46:49.225 --> 46:51.394
I understand they're
understaffed and all that,

46:51.436 --> 46:55.148
but you're also burning out
your new officers.

46:57.150 --> 46:58.818
Officer Drake (over phone):
Just take some time, dude.

46:58.902 --> 47:00.945
If you bottle it up
it's just gonna come back,

47:01.029 --> 47:03.865
and it's just gonna,
really mess you up personally,

47:03.948 --> 47:08.119
and it's not gonna be
a good experience.

47:10.121 --> 47:12.749
Silversmith: When you go out
and do your job,

47:12.791 --> 47:15.210
traumatic events
follow you home.

47:16.002 --> 47:20.882
It plagues our family,
our children, our home life.

47:22.926 --> 47:26.012
For us to keep
our people safe,

47:26.096 --> 47:30.141
we have to learn
to keep evil away.

47:30.225 --> 47:32.644
Same way
with the Twin Warriors,

47:33.603 --> 47:37.399
they were so busy destroying
all these monsters,

47:37.482 --> 47:41.903
they forgot to care
for their own spiritual side.

47:44.906 --> 47:47.158
They started to become weak.

47:47.784 --> 47:50.370
They started succumbing
to illnesses,

47:50.453 --> 47:55.000
and one of the Twin Warriors
actually, um, died.

47:56.334 --> 47:59.671
But the last warrior
got help.

48:00.213 --> 48:02.799
He started getting
ceremonies done,

48:02.841 --> 48:06.094
getting back into
harmonious balance.

48:06.761 --> 48:12.100
So, in Navajo law enforcement,
you have to balance your life.

48:30.035 --> 48:34.914
(people chattering)

48:35.832 --> 48:37.459
(Antwan laughing)

48:39.044 --> 48:41.171
Yeah, I start tomorrow.
I start tomorrow night.

48:41.212 --> 48:42.380
-Kevin: Oh, you do?
-Antwan: Yeah.

48:42.505 --> 48:46.509
Just be me going to calls
by myself, all alone.

48:47.052 --> 48:49.512
Ooh, nice, shiny.

48:51.348 --> 48:52.432
It's a badge.

48:52.849 --> 48:53.808
Mm-hmm.

48:53.892 --> 48:55.477
From this work,
I'm learning

48:55.560 --> 48:57.187
that family,

48:57.228 --> 48:59.064
that's where most of
your happiness comes from,

48:59.147 --> 49:01.191
and, like,
just how to spend,

49:01.232 --> 49:04.069
like, your time wisely
with your family.

49:04.235 --> 49:06.696
Artie Aragon: I've known Antwan
since he was a little boy.

49:07.072 --> 49:08.323
He came to seek counsel

49:08.406 --> 49:10.617
and told me he wanted
to be a police officer.

49:11.034 --> 49:15.080
I said, "Why do you want
to do that?

49:15.121 --> 49:18.375
"When you have to make
split-second decisions,

49:18.416 --> 49:22.837
when bullets are flying,
that is not an easy task."

49:23.421 --> 49:24.714
Whether they make
the right choices...

49:24.756 --> 49:26.716
Antwan:
The fear of this situation now,

49:27.384 --> 49:30.220
that fear is always
gonna be there.

49:30.261 --> 49:32.722
Artie:
... a mind of sacrifice.

49:32.764 --> 49:34.766
Antwan:
But this church is,

49:34.849 --> 49:36.851
it's gonna
provide support always,

49:37.519 --> 49:40.605
'cause I can show my kids
that there could be balance

49:40.980 --> 49:43.817
between having time with them,

49:44.359 --> 49:46.277
having balance with my wife,

49:46.945 --> 49:50.448
having balance
with work and God.

49:50.490 --> 49:54.452
Firstly, I lift up Antwan,
his wife, and his children.

49:54.494 --> 49:56.996
Antwan: So we're gonna
keep our faith here.

49:57.080 --> 49:59.833
Artie: Watch over them
and protect them.

49:59.916 --> 50:01.626
Antwan: And I know it's gonna
help me in the field,

50:01.710 --> 50:05.505
because whatever happens
out there, I'll know for sure,

50:05.714 --> 50:07.966
like, I'm okay, I'm fine.

50:08.299 --> 50:11.803
Artie: Let's give the Lord
a clap offering this morning.

50:11.845 --> 50:14.305
(applause)

50:17.726 --> 50:18.810
Kevin:
Stand on this side.

50:19.144 --> 50:20.645
Make sure you take
some good shots.

50:21.062 --> 50:22.605
Everybody say, "Cops."

50:24.524 --> 50:26.901
Currinda:
Oh, you take care of yourself.

50:26.985 --> 50:28.361
Antwan:
Thank you, mom.

50:29.320 --> 50:32.032
Currinda: I love you, son.
I love you.

50:32.115 --> 50:34.659
(crying)
You take care of yourself.

50:35.410 --> 50:36.661
(Currinda sighs)

50:42.167 --> 50:45.045
(engine revving)

50:45.128 --> 50:46.671
(indistinct radio chatter)

50:52.635 --> 50:56.765
(dogs barking)

50:59.142 --> 51:01.144
(knocking on door)

51:04.356 --> 51:06.149
Can you come out here
and talk to us?

51:07.067 --> 51:09.444
Speaker: (sighs)
What do you guys want?

51:10.695 --> 51:12.364
Nora: We got a call that
there was a attempted suicide,

51:12.447 --> 51:13.698
and when we got there,
you're trying

51:13.782 --> 51:15.075
to swing at your mom.

51:15.158 --> 51:16.701
So right now,
turn around for me.

51:17.535 --> 51:18.995
(handcuffs click)

51:19.871 --> 51:22.457
Like I said,
I'm trying to figure out
what's going on, okay?

51:22.749 --> 51:24.209
Speaker:
Okay.

51:43.853 --> 51:44.896
(Nora speaking)

51:51.236 --> 51:53.113
I think the job
is changing me.

51:54.072 --> 51:56.491
Working through these calls,

51:56.574 --> 51:58.410
you can't show your emotions.

51:59.202 --> 52:03.081
It's very heavy,
and that emotional part of me,

52:03.415 --> 52:06.251
just being able
to turn it off and on,

52:06.334 --> 52:09.254
whether, you know,
going to a call,

52:09.504 --> 52:13.425
going home,
that was really hard for me.

52:14.718 --> 52:19.264
But just having a lot
of support from my husband,

52:19.305 --> 52:22.475
it's helped a lot just for me
to be able to open up

52:22.559 --> 52:24.602
instead of staying closed off.

52:26.271 --> 52:28.940
I know things get better.

52:29.399 --> 52:31.651
I mean,
my ex-husband told me,

52:31.735 --> 52:34.112
"You are never ever
gonna be an officer.

52:34.446 --> 52:37.449
You're never gonna do it,
you're never gonna get there."

52:37.782 --> 52:39.617
And yet, here I am.

52:45.665 --> 52:46.875
Nora:
You're gonna have to be able

52:46.958 --> 52:48.877
to hold yourself together

52:48.960 --> 52:50.628
and be there for your people.

52:51.713 --> 52:55.133
For me, it's like
the Twin Warriors.

52:55.216 --> 52:56.676
They put that
big old stick down

52:56.760 --> 52:59.637
to where the giant's blood
would not continue to run.

52:59.721 --> 53:01.890
That was a barrier
that they put there.

53:02.140 --> 53:05.226
It's like, "No, it stops.

53:05.310 --> 53:06.936
"It's not gonna
continue with me.

53:06.978 --> 53:08.229
It ends here."

53:14.319 --> 53:17.864
(wind gusting)

53:17.947 --> 53:21.659
(birds chirping)

53:23.870 --> 53:27.207
(light music playing)

53:40.470 --> 53:42.972
Shawvan: I just want
to do whatever I can

53:43.014 --> 53:44.724
with the life that I have.

53:45.600 --> 53:49.729
And for me,
it was being a cop,

53:49.813 --> 53:51.690
and I set out to do that.

53:52.273 --> 53:55.527
I'm finally here,
where I wanted to be,

53:55.568 --> 53:59.364
but then now,
going back into work,

53:59.406 --> 54:00.490
I'll start overthinking,

54:00.532 --> 54:01.866
"Okay, how am I going
to do this?

54:01.950 --> 54:03.576
How am I going
to handle it?"

54:06.287 --> 54:09.582
I told Sergeant Williams
about the shooting,

54:10.291 --> 54:12.585
and he was like,
"Now you know yourself.

54:12.669 --> 54:15.255
"You know that
you're not somebody

54:15.338 --> 54:16.923
"that's gonna run away
from anything.

54:17.007 --> 54:18.383
You run towards it."

54:22.470 --> 54:24.389
It kinda made me realize

54:24.431 --> 54:26.975
that I've become
a total new person.

54:28.351 --> 54:30.311
I'm the guy
in the badge now.

54:31.980 --> 54:35.984
So I can't just tuck my tail
between my legs and run off,

54:36.484 --> 54:38.903
I just had to roll
with the punches.

54:45.285 --> 54:46.703
Announcer:
We hope you guys are set.

54:46.745 --> 54:48.747
Uh, it's gonna be
a gorgeous evening.

54:48.788 --> 54:51.416
I know it got
a little chilly last night,

54:51.458 --> 54:52.667
once that wind started blowing

54:52.751 --> 54:55.795
and everybody started,
uh, headed to the cars...

54:55.879 --> 54:57.088
(indistinct)

55:01.843 --> 55:03.845
-Thanks for waiting.
-(horn honks)

55:03.928 --> 55:06.514
-(indistinct radio chatter)
-Good morning.

55:06.598 --> 55:07.766
Lt. Kee: The Navajo Nation,
you know,

55:07.807 --> 55:09.434
we've been here
for a long time.

55:10.018 --> 55:14.773
Navajo people are-are resilient
in their approach to life.

55:15.106 --> 55:16.775
Um, they've had to be.

55:18.693 --> 55:21.988
We occupy a space
in the middle of a country

55:22.822 --> 55:26.785
that we say is ours,
but is it truly ours?

55:27.786 --> 55:29.621
And that's always been
a problem.

55:31.122 --> 55:34.668
But I'm hopeful that we're able
to make things better.

55:34.751 --> 55:36.211
I mean, things could
always get better.

55:36.294 --> 55:38.296
(excited chatter)

55:38.713 --> 55:40.674
Eugenia:
We have sacrificed so much

55:40.757 --> 55:44.094
for our land
and what it means to us.

55:44.761 --> 55:49.808
There's always been that
willingness to work together,

55:49.849 --> 55:53.645
and there's so many hurdles
in the way right now,

55:53.687 --> 55:56.147
so it's not an easy task,

55:56.189 --> 55:57.982
but that's what we have to do.

55:59.859 --> 56:01.695
Silversmith:
We have to move forward.

56:03.488 --> 56:05.657
That's the Navajo way of life.

56:07.200 --> 56:09.160
Bad things that happen,
you forget,

56:09.202 --> 56:11.162
and you move on
and you move forward.

56:12.080 --> 56:14.165
Focus on the straight path

56:14.249 --> 56:16.876
and prepare
for what's to come.

56:19.337 --> 56:21.506
