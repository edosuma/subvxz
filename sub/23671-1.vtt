01:39.378 --> 01:41.847
Do everything
just like I told you, old man,

01:41.915 --> 01:44.850
and you'll live to make some more
of these bone boxes.

02:04.371 --> 02:06.203
Open the gates!

02:31.901 --> 02:33.233
Hey, Jonas!

02:33.303 --> 02:35.100
Hope you made 'em extra long.

02:35.172 --> 02:37.470
We got a couple of big ones.

03:37.038 --> 03:38.370
Bring 'em out.

05:20.582 --> 05:22.744
Keep cool, old man.

05:23.953 --> 05:27.081
Graber, look at that.

05:37.334 --> 05:39.325
Ned Cawley, Frank Graber...

05:39.403 --> 05:41.667
Joe Maxwell, Jesse Barton.

05:41.739 --> 05:44.572
You've been found guilty of murder
in the first degree...

05:45.376 --> 05:48.278
...by the people
of the territory of Arizona

05:48.346 --> 05:50.814
and on this thirteenth day
of January

05:50.882 --> 05:53.373
in the year of Our Lord 1891...

05:55.887 --> 05:59.050
I am hereby ordered
by this warrant to have you...

05:59.124 --> 06:00.786
hanged until dead.

06:01.994 --> 06:03.154
You boys wanna make a...

06:04.297 --> 06:05.787
You boys wanna make a statement?

06:05.865 --> 06:07.264
Hurry it up, fat boy.

06:07.333 --> 06:08.994
We have a date in hell for dinner.

06:09.068 --> 06:10.330
Shut up.

06:10.403 --> 06:12.303
Why don't you go...

07:27.786 --> 07:29.845
Hang the warden,
hang the warden,

07:29.922 --> 07:31.116
hang the warden,

07:31.189 --> 07:33.420
hang the warden...

07:47.107 --> 07:48.870
Shut up!

07:48.943 --> 07:50.308
Shut up in there!

08:07.696 --> 08:10.894
Quiet! Cut it out!
Shut up in there!

08:25.849 --> 08:27.510
This one's holding on.

08:28.885 --> 08:30.546
Can't last much longer, though.

08:31.521 --> 08:34.456
You're gonna see a lot of men
hang before you get out of here, Wes.

08:34.524 --> 08:35.855
Oh, yeah?

08:36.559 --> 08:39.394
You've been good to me
in this hole, Cain, and I like you.

08:39.464 --> 08:41.091
But let me tell you this.

08:41.164 --> 08:44.965
I ain't gonna sit in here
for 18 years and rot like you did.

08:46.270 --> 08:48.329
No pen can hold
Luke Santee's brother.

08:50.109 --> 08:51.167
You'll see.

08:58.717 --> 08:59.877
It's all done.

09:01.820 --> 09:03.550
Bring out the wagon.

09:18.572 --> 09:20.301
Swing the wagon over
to the gallows.

09:20.374 --> 09:21.671
I'm gonna fill these things up.

09:22.476 --> 09:23.909
They're already filled!

09:32.220 --> 09:33.312
Come on, Luke, over here!

10:51.706 --> 10:54.197
Luke, Luke,
come on down this way.

10:54.275 --> 10:55.264
Here I am!

10:55.343 --> 10:58.005
- Hurry up!
- Damn it! Come on down here, Luke!

10:59.113 --> 11:01.878
You've each got six shells apiece, boys.
Make 'em count!

11:01.950 --> 11:03.076
Come on, Luke!

11:03.152 --> 11:04.517
Boy, am I glad to see you, Luke!

11:09.725 --> 11:11.215
Go for the gate!

11:12.795 --> 11:13.990
Go for the gate!

11:14.063 --> 11:15.428
Gimme the gun!

11:15.498 --> 11:16.897
Go for the gate!

11:41.927 --> 11:43.986
Come on, Cain.
We can use a man like you.

11:44.062 --> 11:46.622
Don't do it, kid, even if you make it
out of here, they'll get you.

11:46.698 --> 11:47.687
Wes!

12:19.567 --> 12:22.092
Hank, get over here!

14:31.009 --> 14:32.499
Cain...

14:32.577 --> 14:34.841
you bastard!

14:34.912 --> 14:38.006
You dirty bastard!

14:46.692 --> 14:49.286
Cain's a rehabilitated man.

14:49.361 --> 14:51.727
Well, that's a credit to you
and your institution, Warden.

14:51.797 --> 14:53.594
Oh, no, it's a credit to Cain.

14:53.665 --> 14:56.294
And that's why the court saw fit
to release him.

14:56.369 --> 14:57.893
Cain will never
pick up a gun again.

14:57.971 --> 15:00.735
The hell he won't!
He'll have to.

15:02.475 --> 15:06.343
Cain spent half his life right there
in the cell where loud mouth is standing.

15:06.413 --> 15:08.848
Cain was a tough kid
when he came here in '73.

15:08.916 --> 15:10.474
Now he's a mellowed man

15:10.551 --> 15:13.714
with dreams
of making an honest life for himself.

15:13.788 --> 15:15.688
Do you have any idea
where he might have gone?

15:15.756 --> 15:18.884
Why don't you try Las Rinas?
It's the nearest town.

15:43.286 --> 15:44.617
Hey, look out!

16:03.041 --> 16:04.372
Bobby?

16:05.276 --> 16:07.767
Bobby, bring those crates
right over here.

16:11.716 --> 16:13.912
- Can I help you?
- No.

16:44.152 --> 16:46.552
Hey, whatcha doin', mister?

16:47.221 --> 16:48.848
I'm just looking, son.

16:49.624 --> 16:52.321
Never seen you around here before.

16:52.394 --> 16:53.952
You just passing through?

16:56.198 --> 16:57.597
I don't know.

16:58.300 --> 16:59.892
Are you a cowboy?

17:01.136 --> 17:02.125
No.

17:02.204 --> 17:04.637
- A miner?
- Nope.

17:06.643 --> 17:08.577
It's Ruffalo!

17:24.694 --> 17:27.289
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

17:27.364 --> 17:30.663
Step right up.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

17:30.734 --> 17:34.569
See the spectacular shootin' show
and death display.

17:34.639 --> 17:38.632
See the world's greatest gunslinger.

17:38.710 --> 17:41.406
His firearm's first fiddle, folks.

17:41.479 --> 17:46.076
He's a sharp one, folks.
He's a shootin' shark!

17:46.152 --> 17:51.055
And see the world-famous collection
of macabre curios inside.

17:51.123 --> 17:53.250
The little lump of lead
that was removed

17:53.326 --> 17:55.089
from Jesse James' back.

17:55.161 --> 17:59.326
And the number noose
that nicked Nick Norris's nasty nape!

17:59.399 --> 18:02.926
It's the biggest little show
in the territory.

18:03.003 --> 18:07.269
And no lesser person than the great
Mr. Twain himself said, "It's the best!"

18:07.341 --> 18:09.639
All right, step right up,
ladies and gentlemen.

18:09.710 --> 18:12.271
Now here's your change, sir.
Thank you very much.

18:12.347 --> 18:16.113
All right, thank you, go right in.
There's plenty of room for everybody.

18:16.184 --> 18:20.518
Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of the
best shows you've ever seen in your life.

18:21.689 --> 18:24.181
There you go, two of you.
Enjoy yourself.

18:24.260 --> 18:27.161
Thank you very much.
Don't miss the shootin', kid.

18:27.229 --> 18:29.322
Don't miss the death display!

19:06.338 --> 19:09.466
Betcha never thought
you'd see that again, did you, Cain?

19:13.445 --> 19:14.776
No, I...

19:15.581 --> 19:16.980
I never did.

19:17.050 --> 19:19.883
I won it in a poker game.

19:21.788 --> 19:24.188
I heard you were gettin' out and...

19:24.257 --> 19:26.817
Well, I hoped
that our paths might cross.

19:26.893 --> 19:29.328
I figured you might be lookin' for a job.

19:29.396 --> 19:31.193
Well, I am, mister, but...

19:31.265 --> 19:34.029
Not Mr. Butt, Mr. Ruffalo.

19:34.101 --> 19:36.001
Dan Ruffalo.

19:37.404 --> 19:42.138
Listen, Cain,
I have a proposition for you.

19:44.346 --> 19:47.247
If your proposition involves this,
I ain't interested.

19:47.315 --> 19:49.977
Oh, now, don't be so hasty, man.

19:50.051 --> 19:53.077
I think you might like
what I have to say. Sit down.

19:54.824 --> 19:57.691
- Have a little drink?
- Yeah.

19:59.895 --> 20:04.628
I know how tough it is
for guys like you to find a job.

20:05.334 --> 20:09.738
It's a shame folks feel the way they do
about people who've served a little time,

20:09.806 --> 20:12.775
but, well, it's a fact.

20:12.843 --> 20:15.641
And I might help you.

20:15.712 --> 20:17.202
What do you mean?

20:17.280 --> 20:20.147
Well, I've got a pretty good
little business drummed up

20:20.217 --> 20:22.448
in this here territory.

20:22.520 --> 20:24.681
You can hear that.

20:24.756 --> 20:27.384
Billy and me,
we make pretty good money.

20:27.458 --> 20:30.154
And the work ain't hard and...

20:30.228 --> 20:36.395
Well, I kinda figured you might have
a hankering to... join up with us.

20:36.468 --> 20:38.868
What do you need me for?

20:41.240 --> 20:45.700
Well, you know, I kinda figured
that folks might enjoy seeing Killer...

20:47.480 --> 20:49.607
There, you see?

20:49.682 --> 20:53.516
I almost said Killer Cain,
well, damn it all, I did say it.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.315
Killer Cain.

20:56.523 --> 21:00.551
I think people might really have
something to talk about if they could...

21:01.462 --> 21:03.930
Well, if they could see you...

21:06.300 --> 21:09.963
...using this notched Colt of yours.

21:12.072 --> 21:14.769
Yeah, I see what you mean, but...

21:14.843 --> 21:16.140
No, thanks.

21:16.344 --> 21:18.778
I know you mean well,
but I just ain't interested.

21:18.847 --> 21:20.405
There's good money in it.

21:20.482 --> 21:23.144
I just don't want to be
around guns, mister.

21:23.218 --> 21:25.813
I think you can understand why.

21:28.491 --> 21:32.985
Well, what do you figure
on doing then?

21:33.596 --> 21:35.461
Oh, I don't know, I...

21:36.899 --> 21:38.059
I'll find work.

21:38.134 --> 21:42.333
Cain, listen to me.

21:43.474 --> 21:44.998
The West is...

21:45.075 --> 21:48.875
a lot different than it was back in '73,
when you were part of it.

21:48.946 --> 21:50.777
A whole lot different.

21:50.848 --> 21:54.114
The railroad and the telegraph,
they've changed everything...

21:54.185 --> 21:55.709
or almost everything.

21:55.787 --> 21:59.484
The only fact that you can be sure of
is that you're Cain.

22:00.325 --> 22:02.520
A man to be feared.

22:02.594 --> 22:04.893
Certainly not trusted.

22:05.731 --> 22:08.723
No, it's gonna be real rough for you
to find a job.

22:08.801 --> 22:10.632
It is for all ex-cons.

22:12.371 --> 22:15.772
Well, maybe you've noticed
that men don't wear guns anymore,

22:15.841 --> 22:17.833
unless they're on the road.

22:17.911 --> 22:20.778
No, things have
settled down out here.

22:20.847 --> 22:24.248
And that makes for a lot of...
Easterners coming out west.

22:24.317 --> 22:26.512
And there ain't
enough jobs for them.

22:26.586 --> 22:28.281
Let alone, you.

22:30.290 --> 22:31.952
I hope you're wrong, mister.

22:32.026 --> 22:33.823
I ain't.

22:36.464 --> 22:38.261
They didn't like me,
they love me.

22:38.933 --> 22:40.093
Billy.

22:40.167 --> 22:42.658
This here is Killer Cain.

22:46.975 --> 22:48.135
This is...

22:48.210 --> 22:49.905
This is the man, right here?

22:49.978 --> 22:52.173
The genuine article.

22:55.651 --> 22:57.313
Thanks for the drink, Ruffalo.

22:57.387 --> 22:59.878
I guess I better get going
and find some work.

22:59.956 --> 23:02.390
Sorry we couldn't make a deal.

23:06.563 --> 23:08.724
Say, I'm sure glad to have met you.

23:33.258 --> 23:34.589
All right, men, form a group.

23:34.659 --> 23:36.321
Right around here.

23:44.337 --> 23:47.568
I need four men only.
Big and strong.

23:49.176 --> 23:50.507
You, there.

23:53.547 --> 23:54.605
You.

23:57.284 --> 23:58.751
You.

23:59.419 --> 24:01.250
You there with no hat on.

24:04.559 --> 24:07.551
I'm sorry, Cain, it's...
it's company policy.

24:08.563 --> 24:10.224
Let's go, men.

24:23.012 --> 24:24.343
Hey, mister.

24:25.147 --> 24:26.944
I see you're looking for work.

24:27.016 --> 24:29.349
- I sure am.
- See that wagon?

24:30.587 --> 24:33.147
Two bucks if you drive it
to Cragston's mine.

24:34.290 --> 24:38.158
Put the stuff inside, and I'll give you
another two bucks when you get back.

24:40.831 --> 24:42.264
You know where it's that?

24:44.235 --> 24:46.226
You just point me
in the right direction.

25:02.487 --> 25:03.545
Morning!

27:15.730 --> 27:18.393
I wanna be able to do this again.

27:23.773 --> 27:25.832
You're gonna have it
a lot rougher out

27:25.908 --> 27:27.136
than you did in.

28:52.802 --> 28:54.030
Hello!

28:54.871 --> 28:56.532
Anybody here?

29:35.281 --> 29:37.772
I just needed a little water. I...

29:39.051 --> 29:40.713
I didn't mean any harm.

29:43.824 --> 29:45.951
I hollered but nobody answered.

29:49.162 --> 29:50.561
I...

29:52.699 --> 29:54.600
I guess I don't look too good.

29:55.603 --> 29:57.434
I had a little accident.

30:10.786 --> 30:11.844
May I?

30:20.196 --> 30:22.027
There's some rags
in back there, too.

30:26.169 --> 30:27.500
My name's Cain.

30:28.705 --> 30:30.400
Just Cain.

30:30.473 --> 30:31.735
Justin Cain?

30:32.475 --> 30:33.773
No, ma'am.

30:33.844 --> 30:35.243
Just...

30:35.312 --> 30:37.109
Only Cain.

30:39.383 --> 30:40.714
What happened to you?

30:40.785 --> 30:42.116
Well...

30:43.320 --> 30:45.288
I guess you could say I got fired.

30:48.460 --> 30:50.985
You're going back to... Las Rinas?

30:51.063 --> 30:53.258
Dry Wood.

30:53.331 --> 30:55.060
I came out here this morning.

30:55.133 --> 30:57.795
Be going back
as soon as I finish my painting.

30:57.869 --> 30:59.531
They say this town was abandoned

30:59.605 --> 31:02.130
when the stage line
stopped making its run.

31:02.975 --> 31:04.704
Guess you know all about that.

31:07.513 --> 31:09.538
That does it for today.

31:09.615 --> 31:12.210
- That sure is good.
- Thank you.

31:13.954 --> 31:16.286
I was wondering, miss, if I...

31:16.356 --> 31:18.756
could ride in with you?
To Dry Wood?

31:19.726 --> 31:21.125
We'll make a deal.

31:21.195 --> 31:24.631
You help me get my supplies in the
buckboard, I'll get you into Dry Wood.

31:24.699 --> 31:25.961
Yes, ma'am.

31:26.034 --> 31:28.093
By the way,
my name is Monica Alton.

31:29.904 --> 31:32.065
Things have changed around here,
haven't they?

31:32.140 --> 31:33.971
Yes, ma'am, they sure have.

31:34.642 --> 31:36.371
That's why I'm out here.

31:37.278 --> 31:38.940
I'm doing a series.

31:39.014 --> 31:42.541
Not just sketches,
but paintings, as well.

31:42.618 --> 31:46.110
I hope to capture pictorially
what Bret Harte and Mark Twain

31:46.188 --> 31:48.247
were able to put into words.

31:48.324 --> 31:50.588
"Local color,"
if you know what I mean.

31:50.659 --> 31:52.992
No, ma'am,
I can't says I do.

31:53.063 --> 31:55.327
There's no reason why you should.

31:57.667 --> 32:00.329
Well, you've got local color,
you belong out here.

32:01.304 --> 32:03.739
You have a very interesting face.

32:03.808 --> 32:05.833
I'd like to paint it some time.

32:06.677 --> 32:08.008
Who are you?

32:08.079 --> 32:10.104
I told you, my name's Cain.

32:10.281 --> 32:11.839
I mean, what do you do?

32:15.219 --> 32:17.620
I didn't mean to pry.
It's really none of my business.

32:18.690 --> 32:20.555
I don't blame you for wondering.

32:21.760 --> 32:23.193
Why don't we...

32:23.262 --> 32:26.197
get moving and we can talk about it
on the way to dinner.

32:26.899 --> 32:29.766
- Is that an invitation?
- Yes, ma'am. I've got two...

32:31.237 --> 32:32.568
What's the matter?

32:33.506 --> 32:35.303
Well, I had two dollars.

32:35.375 --> 32:38.674
I guess I not only got fired,
I got robbed.

32:39.846 --> 32:41.507
I went to Vassar.

32:42.015 --> 32:44.280
That's a school back east for women.

32:44.351 --> 32:46.182
I detested it.

32:46.754 --> 32:49.484
So of course I didn't do very well
in my studies.

32:50.257 --> 32:51.690
I flunked out.

32:52.560 --> 32:54.255
But I didn't care, anyway.

32:54.328 --> 32:57.162
'Cause all I wanted to do
was come out west and paint.

32:58.800 --> 33:01.735
My father thought
I was running away from failure.

33:02.871 --> 33:04.862
He tried to encourage me by saying

33:04.940 --> 33:07.932
that it wasn't what happened
in the past that mattered,

33:08.009 --> 33:09.443
it was the future.

33:10.346 --> 33:12.610
You're trying to encourage me by...

33:12.682 --> 33:15.549
telling me that I should forget my past.

33:15.618 --> 33:17.813
Well, I'd like to, but...

33:17.887 --> 33:20.583
it seems like most people
remember too hard.

33:20.656 --> 33:22.420
Why do you help them?

33:23.460 --> 33:24.984
I don't understand.

33:25.796 --> 33:27.923
Why did you tell me your name?

33:28.665 --> 33:31.429
Why didn't you say it was Crane,
or something else?

33:31.501 --> 33:35.029
It isn't what people think you are
that matters. It's what you are.

33:37.342 --> 33:40.800
Would you promise
an intuitive woman something?

33:41.980 --> 33:43.572
I'll make a deal with you.

33:43.648 --> 33:46.879
If you say yes,
I'll treat you to that dinner.

33:48.721 --> 33:51.281
- You sure like to make deals.
- Well?

33:52.191 --> 33:54.250
Well, it sounds
mighty tempting, but...

33:54.326 --> 33:56.089
You can pay me back later.

33:57.129 --> 33:58.289
Say it's a deal.

34:00.933 --> 34:02.799
All right. It's a deal.

34:02.869 --> 34:04.393
Why don't you get out of here?

34:05.305 --> 34:08.603
Why hang around small towns
where people will remember?

34:10.744 --> 34:14.476
Go east or north
to a city like Prescott.

34:36.103 --> 34:38.937
- That's Killer Cain.
- I know.

34:39.007 --> 34:41.203
I I heard he was here in Dry Wood
a couple months back.

34:41.277 --> 34:42.437
This winter.

34:42.512 --> 34:44.342
Do you... happen to know
where he went?

34:44.414 --> 34:45.540
No.

34:46.416 --> 34:48.577
It's getting dark in here.

34:48.650 --> 34:50.516
I never saw Cain.

34:50.585 --> 34:53.920
I bought that sketch off of Joe Kirby
over at the boarding house.

34:53.991 --> 34:57.222
Some girl left it behind
when she decided to move on.

35:13.411 --> 35:17.871
Round and round she goes,
and where she stops nobody knows.

35:18.717 --> 35:21.744
Two to one, gentlemen.
Here you are.

35:23.155 --> 35:24.213
Thank you.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.683
Sorry, place your bets now.

35:30.096 --> 35:33.362
Place your bets.
Last chance.

35:34.568 --> 35:36.832
- Night, Justin.
- Good night, Bruce.

35:55.423 --> 35:58.119
All right, folks.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

35:58.192 --> 36:01.720
Step right up and see
the spectacular shooting show

36:01.797 --> 36:03.458
and death display.

36:03.532 --> 36:06.228
See the world's
greatest gunslinger.

36:09.071 --> 36:12.599
He's sharp.
He's a shootin' shark.

36:12.675 --> 36:15.769
So step right up and get
your tickets here, ladies and gentlemen.

36:16.946 --> 36:18.004
Justin.

36:22.152 --> 36:23.619
He sure is loud.

36:24.622 --> 36:27.455
There's a kid in there
that's pretty good with a gun.

36:27.525 --> 36:29.015
You've seen the show?

36:29.593 --> 36:32.221
A couple of months ago
in Las Rinas.

36:32.296 --> 36:35.060
...show, and the death display,
ladies and gentlemen.

37:19.180 --> 37:20.670
Place your bets,
ladies and gentlemen.

37:20.748 --> 37:22.613
Yes, sir,
you can place your bets.

37:24.118 --> 37:26.018
Place your bets.

37:26.087 --> 37:29.455
Round and round she goes
and where she stops nobody knows.

37:29.525 --> 37:32.255
Everybody down.
Place your bets.

37:32.328 --> 37:33.727
She's stopping.

37:34.330 --> 37:35.661
Two to one!

37:36.332 --> 37:38.857
Here you are,
here you are, thank you.

37:41.103 --> 37:42.765
Thank you, young lady.

37:42.839 --> 37:44.500
Everybody down.

37:48.345 --> 37:50.142
Place your bets, all right?

37:56.354 --> 37:57.685
You know what I want, Jim.

37:57.755 --> 37:59.188
Right away, Sheree.

38:13.338 --> 38:16.171
- Could I ask you something?
- Yeah, sure.

38:16.241 --> 38:19.608
How's that thing work?
I don't know much about that.

38:19.678 --> 38:21.145
It's simple.

38:22.148 --> 38:24.844
Why don't you come over when
I'm on the wheel and I'll show you.

38:24.918 --> 38:26.249
Oh, I...

38:26.319 --> 38:29.413
That would be fine.
I sure would like you to do that.

38:29.956 --> 38:31.321
Anytime.

38:32.025 --> 38:34.790
Say, aren't you that kid
from the shooting show?

38:37.331 --> 38:38.821
I'm the star.

38:39.667 --> 38:42.227
Well, I didn't see the show,
but I sure heard it.

38:42.303 --> 38:43.497
You did?

38:43.971 --> 38:46.804
Say, honey,
you sure do make a lot of noise.

39:07.463 --> 39:08.623
Fix me a drink.

39:10.099 --> 39:11.430
Sorry, son.

39:11.500 --> 39:13.365
I got a tough boss.

39:13.436 --> 39:15.428
All I can serve you is a sarsaparilla.

39:15.505 --> 39:18.770
- A... a what?
- Sarsaparilla.

39:20.711 --> 39:22.042
You kidding me?

39:22.112 --> 39:25.275
There's nothing I can do,
they made it a law.

39:26.149 --> 39:28.277
I see, they made it a law.

39:28.353 --> 39:31.789
Well, look, I'm not interested
in a civics lesson, mister.

39:31.856 --> 39:35.451
I'd just appreciate
if you'd just fix me a drink, there.

39:35.526 --> 39:36.891
Can't you read?

39:37.762 --> 39:41.255
Let's see.
"No minor persons served."

39:43.202 --> 39:45.932
Now, I can read that sign,
but I don't believe it.

39:46.005 --> 39:49.133
I would appreciate it if you would
not worry so much about my schooling

39:49.208 --> 39:52.439
and tell your hands to do their stuff
or I'll blow 'em off your wrists!

39:53.513 --> 39:56.846
You got any ideas about using
that gun in here, son, forget it.

39:57.717 --> 39:58.775
Cain!

39:59.653 --> 40:02.087
"Cain"?
What are you talking about, kid?

40:02.155 --> 40:03.816
That man's name is Justin.

40:03.890 --> 40:07.349
I don't know about that.
That... that's Cain. That is Mr. Cain.

40:07.428 --> 40:08.952
"Killer Cain."

40:09.997 --> 40:13.933
l... I was just playing,
just messing around, you know.

40:14.001 --> 40:15.491
I sure wouldn't mess with you.

40:15.569 --> 40:18.197
I sure wouldn't mess
with Killer Cain, would you?

40:19.374 --> 40:21.035
<i>That's Killer Cain.</i>

40:22.277 --> 40:24.302
<i>That's Killer Cain.</i>

40:32.021 --> 40:35.013
Cain? Or is it Justin?

40:35.892 --> 40:38.156
I witnessed you at work tonight.

40:39.362 --> 40:42.661
I told you it would be tough
finding a job.

40:44.667 --> 40:47.899
Like you said,
you witnessed me at work. I got a job.

40:49.606 --> 40:51.301
But how long did it take?

40:52.276 --> 40:55.439
You know, I've been in a lot of those...

40:55.512 --> 40:58.414
those towns where you've been
in the past few months.

40:58.483 --> 41:02.419
And I... well, I know
how hard it's been for you.

41:02.954 --> 41:04.285
I ain't complaining.

41:05.757 --> 41:09.625
No, you didn't complain
when you were slopping pigs in Bisbee

41:09.694 --> 41:12.664
or cleaning spittoons in Tulsa.

41:12.732 --> 41:14.222
Oh, let's face it, man,

41:14.300 --> 41:16.564
you weren't even able
to hold those jobs,

41:16.635 --> 41:18.830
and you won't be able
to hold this one, either.

41:18.904 --> 41:23.603
I told you once before.
I ain't interested in your proposition.

41:26.012 --> 41:27.036
All right.

41:27.114 --> 41:32.211
I just wanted to let you know
the offer still stands, if and when.

41:33.220 --> 41:37.521
Billy and me'll be pulling out of here
in the morning, for Redrock.

41:38.426 --> 41:40.360
In case you change your mind.

41:44.632 --> 41:49.126
And I was so cock-sure
that I could get Cain to join up with us.

41:49.604 --> 41:54.008
I thought he'd be tired
of those chicken feed jobs by now.

41:54.076 --> 41:56.738
Listen, we are doing all right, Rufe.

41:56.812 --> 41:58.973
Good as folks say he was...

41:59.047 --> 42:01.038
How much better
could he be than me?

42:12.695 --> 42:16.063
If only you hadn't lied to him
in the first place.

42:16.834 --> 42:19.132
Why didn't you just tell him
who you were?

42:19.203 --> 42:21.068
You know,
he probably wouldn't have cared

42:21.138 --> 42:23.402
if you had leveled with him
right from the beginning.

42:23.474 --> 42:26.102
And why did you say
your name was Justin?

42:28.913 --> 42:31.246
It's a long story, Sheree...

42:33.919 --> 42:35.511
Good-bye and thanks again.

42:35.587 --> 42:36.918
For what?

42:37.689 --> 42:39.020
For trying.

42:39.825 --> 42:41.087
Good-bye.

42:46.699 --> 42:49.532
Well, it looks like
everything's in place.

42:56.877 --> 43:00.369
- Your offer still stand?
- Sure!

43:00.981 --> 43:03.142
We were just about to pull out.

43:03.617 --> 43:06.415
Billy, lock up that wagon.

43:07.254 --> 43:09.120
You come with me, Cain.

43:09.190 --> 43:11.181
All right, Billy, let's get rolling.

43:11.259 --> 43:14.023
I gotta stop over at my place
and get my gear.

43:36.953 --> 43:40.548
Eighteen years in prison made me
think I'd never touch another gun.

43:40.624 --> 43:43.388
That gun's gonna earn you
a lot of money, Cain.

43:43.460 --> 43:44.552
Good money.

43:44.628 --> 43:47.792
Yeah, yeah, it sure will.

43:47.865 --> 43:50.766
I bet you're pretty...
pretty good with that.

43:54.205 --> 43:57.038
What I love are those 12 notches.

43:58.276 --> 44:01.178
- Those were the good old days.
- How would you know?

44:01.246 --> 44:02.611
I've heard.

44:04.249 --> 44:05.876
I've heard how every man
would wear a gun

44:05.951 --> 44:08.283
and if he wanted to have it out
with a guy, why, he did.

44:09.821 --> 44:13.383
Today you're lucky
if you can get a guy outside to fist-fight.

44:13.459 --> 44:15.791
Here, load up.

44:20.566 --> 44:22.193
I'll...

44:22.268 --> 44:24.759
see if I can trim
that branch back a little.

45:38.384 --> 45:40.477
Looks like I need some practice.

45:57.838 --> 45:59.328
I never miss.

45:59.740 --> 46:04.234
Well, Cain,
you just got yourself a free show.

46:06.213 --> 46:09.546
Now, I know what you're doing there,
you're holding back, aren't you?

46:09.617 --> 46:10.880
- No.
- Yes, you are.

46:10.952 --> 46:14.547
I know you killed 12 men. I know
you must have been sharper than that.

46:14.623 --> 46:16.090
I was.

46:16.158 --> 46:18.888
How'd you do it?
How'd you kill 'em, I mean?

46:18.960 --> 46:20.552
Different men, different ways.

46:20.629 --> 46:23.223
"Different men, different ways"?

46:23.766 --> 46:26.200
But you always let 'em
draw first, right?

46:26.269 --> 46:27.566
No.

46:27.637 --> 46:30.162
Not if there was a chance
I might get beat.

46:30.239 --> 46:33.072
The only code I had
was to let 'em know I was coming.

46:34.077 --> 46:36.569
But you never
bushwhacked anyone, did you?

46:36.647 --> 46:39.639
Well, like I said, they knew
I was coming, so they all had guns

46:39.716 --> 46:41.377
and none of them got it in the back.

46:42.853 --> 46:44.377
Well, see, I thought...

46:44.455 --> 46:46.787
You thought that
I marched down the street,

46:46.857 --> 46:49.189
called 'em out
and waited for 'em to draw?

46:50.462 --> 46:52.191
No, Billy, I...

46:52.964 --> 46:55.797
I was hired to use my gun and I did.

46:58.903 --> 47:00.200
Well, l...

47:02.073 --> 47:04.167
I'd let anyone draw first.

47:05.044 --> 47:07.672
'Cause I can outdraw anyone.

47:08.547 --> 47:13.007
It's... it's hard for me to believe
that you never were as good as I am.

47:13.085 --> 47:15.417
Good at what,
Billy, hitting branches?

47:16.323 --> 47:18.951
Or killing men?
There is a difference.

47:19.025 --> 47:22.222
Eighteen years ago
a man never holstered an unloaded gun.

47:23.830 --> 47:25.821
You're just playing games, kid.

47:29.570 --> 47:31.231
Let me ask you something.

47:31.305 --> 47:33.967
How old were you
when you killed your first man?

47:35.042 --> 47:37.567
- Sixteen.
- Sixteen.

47:37.645 --> 47:41.103
What was he?
A sheriff or a marshal or what?

47:41.182 --> 47:43.413
- Soldier.
- Soldier?

47:44.086 --> 47:45.451
How much you get paid?

47:46.855 --> 47:50.188
I didn't get paid anything.
It happened in a fist-fight.

47:50.259 --> 47:51.487
Oh, well.

47:51.560 --> 47:54.894
No, I mean, what about when
you had that first notch on your Colt?

47:54.964 --> 47:56.056
What about it?

47:57.734 --> 48:00.134
I didn't get paid anything
for that, either.

48:00.203 --> 48:03.297
I killed a bounty hunter
who was after my hide.

48:03.373 --> 48:07.036
Well, the first time
you got paid, how much?

48:08.679 --> 48:11.842
- $50.
- $50!

48:11.916 --> 48:13.315
$50.

48:14.185 --> 48:17.382
Fifty bucks
don't mean much to him, Cain.

48:17.454 --> 48:19.854
He's spoiled.

48:19.924 --> 48:23.417
He don't know what it was like
out here in those days.

48:25.130 --> 48:26.620
Well, it was different.

48:27.532 --> 48:29.022
A lot different.

48:29.968 --> 48:32.903
My father was a sergeant
in the Fourth Cavalry,

48:32.971 --> 48:36.066
and they were always out
chasing Indians.

48:36.142 --> 48:39.043
I never saw much of anything
except the inside of army forts

48:39.111 --> 48:40.601
till I killed that soldier.

48:42.248 --> 48:45.411
All my life I'd seen men die.

48:45.484 --> 48:49.319
The ones that lived brag about
killing others, so life was cheap to me.

48:50.090 --> 48:53.526
And $50 was a lot of money.

48:54.695 --> 48:56.890
Especially when you were on the run.

48:56.964 --> 48:59.832
Yeah, you make it sound lousy.

48:59.901 --> 49:01.459
It was.

49:02.237 --> 49:06.731
Hell, I just wish... I just wish
I'd been living in those days.

49:06.808 --> 49:09.641
'Cause the way
I handle a gun, boy, I'll tell ya.

49:09.711 --> 49:12.202
The way you handle a gun,
you'd been a dead man.

49:12.280 --> 49:14.112
Somebody would have
shot you in the back

49:14.183 --> 49:16.344
because they were afraid
to face up to you.

49:16.418 --> 49:19.080
That's the way it was,
and don't you think different.

49:27.364 --> 49:28.422
Mr. Cain.

49:33.303 --> 49:37.706
How come...
no one went for your back?

49:37.774 --> 49:39.402
It's a big enough target.

49:40.411 --> 49:43.403
Well, a fella did once,
but his aim was low.

49:43.481 --> 49:45.745
I got a scar on my ass to prove it.

49:57.296 --> 49:59.787
Here, try that on, for a start.

49:59.865 --> 50:01.992
Go on, man, put it on.
Put it on.

50:04.503 --> 50:07.871
Yeah, it looks good.
It looks good.

50:07.940 --> 50:13.105
Everything's gonna be black.
Black Stetson, black bandana.

50:13.713 --> 50:18.174
Everything black but the silver.
Here, a black jacket, black jacket,

50:18.252 --> 50:20.550
black pants...

50:20.621 --> 50:21.952
Look at this.

50:22.856 --> 50:26.849
Look at that <i>buscadero</i> belt.
Ain't that snazzy, huh?

50:26.927 --> 50:31.024
It's just what a killer's supposed
to wear, ain't it, Cain?

50:31.099 --> 50:35.001
I guess so, but... I sure never
wore nothing like that.

50:35.070 --> 50:37.402
Well, think maybe we better try
some of this on, huh?

50:37.472 --> 50:39.099
We might have to make
some alterations.

50:39.174 --> 50:43.133
You're a big son of a bitch.
Look, here's some black boots.

50:46.182 --> 50:49.515
Killer Cain. Killer Cain.

50:49.585 --> 50:53.112
We stay here for a couple of days,
and then we'll hit Tempe,

50:53.189 --> 50:56.158
and Phoenix, and Higginsville
and Liberty, and...

50:56.225 --> 50:59.559
by the end of the month
we'll be in Valseco.

51:09.873 --> 51:13.139
Mornin', Linus.
Seen The <i>Epitaph?</i>

51:13.211 --> 51:16.840
Well, something in here I think,
uh, will interest you.

51:21.219 --> 51:23.552
Says Cain's coming back to town.

51:23.622 --> 51:26.591
According to the article, Cain's been
with Dan Ruffalo's shootin' show

51:26.658 --> 51:28.091
for almost a month.

51:28.160 --> 51:31.527
He'll be here today or tomorrow.

51:52.153 --> 51:53.745
<i>Ha kee.</i>

52:06.068 --> 52:07.899
I thought we made a deal.

52:10.439 --> 52:11.497
Hi.

52:13.375 --> 52:15.276
I want you to know I tried.

52:15.345 --> 52:16.937
I believe you.

52:17.013 --> 52:20.779
Oh, I'm not kiddin' myself.
I know it's not the best life, but...

52:20.850 --> 52:23.182
it's better than anything
I've ever known.

52:23.253 --> 52:24.914
Then I'm happy for you.

52:26.256 --> 52:29.249
I better go finish my sketch.
It was nice seeing you again.

52:29.326 --> 52:30.588
Wait a minute.

52:32.863 --> 52:34.854
I owe you these.

52:35.799 --> 52:37.767
I had a feeling I'd get these back.

52:38.602 --> 52:39.796
Be seein' ya.

52:39.870 --> 52:41.338
Be seeing you.

53:00.426 --> 53:06.763
All right, folks, step right up.
It's the biggest little show in the territory.

53:06.832 --> 53:11.395
Hurry, hurry, hurry. Thank you, sir.
I hope you enjoy yourself.

53:11.471 --> 53:15.168
Step inside, folks, and see
the spectacular shootin' show,

53:15.242 --> 53:18.109
starring the infamous Killer Cain.

53:18.178 --> 53:21.580
Step right inside,
ladies and gentlemen, if you dare,

53:21.649 --> 53:25.915
and let the Killer show you
the 12 notches on his Colt

53:25.987 --> 53:27.716
and how they got there.

53:27.789 --> 53:30.314
All right, folks, step right up.

53:30.391 --> 53:32.791
Come on, folks,
you got a treat inside. Let... what...

53:32.860 --> 53:34.021
What the hell are you doin'?

53:34.096 --> 53:35.927
All this shouting
about "The Killer," "The Killer".

53:35.998 --> 53:38.398
Now, look...
Listen to me.

53:38.467 --> 53:41.095
- Billy, calm yourself.
- Now, you should listen to me.

53:41.170 --> 53:43.832
You said that I was the star.
I was the star!

53:43.906 --> 53:46.899
Billy, this is my show,
and I'll bark what I damn well please.

53:46.977 --> 53:49.707
Now you get your butt back in there
and do what I pay you to do.

53:49.779 --> 53:50.939
Go on, git, git!

53:51.014 --> 53:54.677
All right, folks, I know you don't wanna
miss this spectacular event.

53:54.751 --> 53:58.016
Here's your change, sir,
thank you very much and...

53:58.088 --> 53:59.248
Carson?

54:01.559 --> 54:05.086
I'm glad to see you!
You come to see the Killer?

54:06.931 --> 54:10.332
You know, I think you and I
might work something out.

54:10.401 --> 54:11.925
What are you getting at?

54:12.003 --> 54:15.872
Well, seein' as how you and Cain
have met before and right out here,

54:15.941 --> 54:21.106
I think folks might, uh, well,
they might enjoy seeing a little... encore.

54:21.179 --> 54:22.840
I'll make it worth your while.

54:27.587 --> 54:29.282
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

54:29.355 --> 54:32.552
step right up, let me see
the color of your money.

55:00.288 --> 55:02.552
Mr. Cain,
would you take a challenge?

55:02.624 --> 55:04.616
Three shots apiece for a dollar?

55:07.163 --> 55:08.152
Sure.

55:31.522 --> 55:33.183
It looked easy.

55:48.240 --> 55:50.299
Well, thanks anyway.

55:50.375 --> 55:53.276
It sure would have been great
if I could have said I'd beat you.

55:57.383 --> 56:00.784
I'm the best shot in town, Cain.
You wanna take me on for a dollar?

56:00.854 --> 56:04.085
Well, I guess we can't see
the Killer back down.

56:06.860 --> 56:08.054
There you go.

56:35.023 --> 56:36.719
Son of a bee!

56:39.729 --> 56:40.957
Cain...

56:43.132 --> 56:45.464
best of six...

56:45.535 --> 56:47.400
on the wheel.

57:22.208 --> 57:24.267
Three out of six.

57:50.471 --> 57:53.599
Six out of six.
Can't beat that.

58:09.926 --> 58:11.917
Mr. Cain, what'll you have?

58:11.995 --> 58:14.293
Well, I'll try some of that rye.

58:14.364 --> 58:15.661
All right.

58:23.407 --> 58:26.342
Say, here, it's the next one,
right here, that's on me.

58:26.410 --> 58:31.746
And, uh... you can pour me...
pour me the same.

58:32.483 --> 58:36.284
At least I don't see any signs around
that says I can't, do you?

58:36.354 --> 58:37.685
Thanks.

58:39.324 --> 58:41.792
Listen, I was... was going
to ask you something...

58:41.860 --> 58:45.853
Oh, yeah. What do you...
what do you think about Rufe?

58:45.930 --> 58:47.956
He's a good man.

58:48.034 --> 58:51.731
Yeah, well, that's...
That's what I thought at first, too.

58:51.804 --> 58:56.707
I really did.
But l... I don't think so now.

58:56.776 --> 59:01.009
When I first met him, he was...
he was moving about the territory,

59:01.081 --> 59:05.745
doin' nothing, I mean, he was selling guns,
but folks weren't buying 'em.

59:05.819 --> 59:08.447
Course, then one day he sees me.

59:08.522 --> 59:09.853
And I'm...

59:09.923 --> 59:13.416
you know, shooting bottles off the fence,
you know how I shoot.

59:13.494 --> 59:16.827
Well, he gets the idea
of trying to drum up a little business

59:16.898 --> 59:20.095
with me showing off his hardware,
so I said, "All right," I said,

59:20.168 --> 59:23.763
"I'll go with you, I'll go along with you."
And one thing led to another.

59:23.838 --> 59:26.103
After a couple of months,
he stopped selling guns

59:26.175 --> 59:29.167
and began selling admissions
to see me shoot.

59:29.244 --> 59:31.405
It seems to me,
he's been pretty good to you.

59:31.480 --> 59:34.643
Hell, but not good enough,
not good enough, shoot!

59:34.717 --> 59:36.981
He treats you a helluva lot better
than he does me!

59:37.052 --> 59:38.987
And I've known him
a lot longer than you,

59:39.055 --> 59:41.717
and I'm a helluva lot better
with a gun than you.

59:41.791 --> 59:45.955
See, what I don't figure
is how he could bark to townsfolk

59:46.029 --> 59:50.864
that I am a shootin' shark,
but forget himself

59:50.934 --> 59:54.098
that I could blow him apart
if I got the urge.

59:55.306 --> 59:58.639
See, people ought to realize that
the same thing I do to those targets

59:58.709 --> 01:00:01.837
I could... I could do to them.

01:00:01.912 --> 01:00:05.542
You're talking awful big, Billy.
Draw against me.

01:00:06.318 --> 01:00:07.410
What?

01:00:07.486 --> 01:00:08.976
You heard me.
Draw your gun.

01:00:11.957 --> 01:00:14.949
You see, when you are a little bit afraid
and not quite sure of yourself,

01:00:15.026 --> 01:00:18.087
even the fastest gun can be beat.

01:00:20.166 --> 01:00:23.329
Things are different
when the target can shoot back.

01:00:23.403 --> 01:00:25.303
You remember that.

01:00:25.371 --> 01:00:27.202
You're still playing.

01:00:27.273 --> 01:00:30.505
Yeah, well, you just stand up
and try that again.

01:00:32.179 --> 01:00:34.409
I couldn't do that, Billy.

01:00:34.481 --> 01:00:35.778
You're dead.

01:01:00.276 --> 01:01:01.607
Well...

01:01:02.611 --> 01:01:05.011
I've waited a long time, Cain.

01:01:07.583 --> 01:01:08.743
Carson.

01:01:10.187 --> 01:01:13.918
I was wondering when I drove in here
this morning if you might still be around.

01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:15.480
Get up.

01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:19.785
No.

01:01:19.863 --> 01:01:21.922
Why don't you sit down?

01:01:21.998 --> 01:01:24.991
I'm calling you outside, Cain.

01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:26.832
Go on, Cain!

01:01:27.905 --> 01:01:30.396
Last time I stepped outside
with a lawman,

01:01:30.475 --> 01:01:32.636
it cost me 18 years of my life.

01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:34.473
I can't afford any more time.

01:01:34.545 --> 01:01:38.346
You forget I'm not
a lawman any more.

01:01:38.417 --> 01:01:40.146
And I'm not a gunfighter.

01:01:40.219 --> 01:01:41.982
You owed your life.

01:01:42.054 --> 01:01:45.114
A court settled for 18 years, Carson.

01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:50.026
Eighteen years don't pay
for all them murders.

01:01:50.096 --> 01:01:52.030
So maybe you paid for one,

01:01:52.098 --> 01:01:55.329
but you got a dozen notches
on your Colt.

01:01:57.871 --> 01:01:59.862
I'm a free man, Carson.

01:02:01.775 --> 01:02:05.211
I don't want any trouble from you
or any other man.

01:02:15.490 --> 01:02:19.085
I would've paid you for that performance
this afternoon, Carson.

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:22.891
You just didn't have what it takes
20 years ago.

01:02:22.964 --> 01:02:29.097
Twenty years ago, Cain was young
and fast, like the kid here.

01:02:29.171 --> 01:02:32.072
But now he's older and slower,

01:02:32.141 --> 01:02:34.166
like I was when he called me.

01:02:34.243 --> 01:02:36.473
When he called you?

01:02:36.546 --> 01:02:41.382
He didn't call you, Carson,
and you didn't go out willingly.

01:02:41.451 --> 01:02:43.646
You were forced into that shootout.

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.051
Forced? I was the Marshall!

01:02:45.122 --> 01:02:47.920
The way I heard it,
the people of this town forced you.

01:02:47.991 --> 01:02:49.322
You're a liar, Ruffalo.

01:02:49.393 --> 01:02:51.884
Oh? Somebody stop me
if I'm wrong.

01:02:51.962 --> 01:02:54.591
- Now, there's no need to...
- No one forced me!

01:02:54.666 --> 01:02:57.931
The thought that Cain was here
in Valseco back in '71

01:02:58.002 --> 01:02:59.765
sent a chill through this town.

01:02:59.837 --> 01:03:01.168
I knew he was here to kill.

01:03:01.239 --> 01:03:03.673
- Yes, but nobody knew who.
- I was the Marshall!

01:03:03.741 --> 01:03:07.473
So they shoved you out of that door
to stop Cain before they could find out.

01:03:07.546 --> 01:03:09.707
- I did my duty!
- And he winged you.

01:03:09.782 --> 01:03:12.615
Because of that,
your marshalin' days were over.

01:03:12.685 --> 01:03:13.845
No one forced me!

01:03:13.919 --> 01:03:17.548
Now you know that Cain
could have killed you that day.

01:03:17.623 --> 01:03:21.025
Lucky for you that he just went
for your shoulder.

01:03:21.094 --> 01:03:25.428
Now, you listen to me, man.
Forget about that revenge, hear?

01:03:25.498 --> 01:03:26.988
I'll buy you a drink.

01:03:27.834 --> 01:03:30.234
Come on,
I'll buy everybody a drink.

01:03:30.303 --> 01:03:32.533
Say, Rufe,
who did he come gunnin' for?

01:03:32.606 --> 01:03:34.336
Oh, some cattleman.

01:03:34.408 --> 01:03:36.433
Yeah, yeah, but did he get him?

01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:38.910
Does an outhouse stink?

01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:42.074
Well, he sure ain't
the same man, I tell you.

01:03:42.149 --> 01:03:46.109
I was kinda hopin' to see he
and that old buzzard get into something.

01:03:46.188 --> 01:03:50.420
Oh, that'd been great.
Either way, we would have lost Cain.

01:04:13.117 --> 01:04:14.482
Cain?

01:04:23.994 --> 01:04:26.520
Makes you feel
like a big man, huh?

01:04:27.432 --> 01:04:29.627
Travelin' around the territory.

01:04:30.869 --> 01:04:33.804
Showing everybody
your 12 notches.

01:04:36.508 --> 01:04:38.534
I'm not proud of what I was.

01:04:38.611 --> 01:04:41.045
Huh? Why else you doin' it?

01:04:41.113 --> 01:04:43.479
'Cause it's the only tool I know.

01:04:43.549 --> 01:04:46.985
I'm not hurting anybody, and I'm
earning an honest living for myself.

01:04:47.053 --> 01:04:51.491
Ain't no way for you to be honest, Cain.
No way at all.

01:04:56.430 --> 01:04:58.955
I haven't got a gun...

01:04:59.032 --> 01:05:00.693
or a mind to draw against you.

01:05:00.767 --> 01:05:04.226
Cain... here you go!

01:05:06.274 --> 01:05:11.302
Well, now, that solves
half your problems, don't it?

01:05:11.379 --> 01:05:13.643
That's right.
Go ahead, shoot him.

01:05:13.715 --> 01:05:15.615
Stick it in your belt, that'll do.

01:05:15.683 --> 01:05:19.085
Just stick it in there
and just... blow his head off.

01:05:19.154 --> 01:05:21.418
Ruffalo claims
that I was forced last time.

01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:24.015
Well, this time I'm forcing you.

01:05:24.093 --> 01:05:25.685
Go ahead, blow it.

01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:31.122
- Damn you! Pick up that gun!
- He means it, I tell you.

01:05:31.201 --> 01:05:33.396
He almost blew my toe off.
Now pick up the gun.

01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:36.405
- Just go ahead and blow his head off.
- Stay out of this, Billy.

01:05:41.244 --> 01:05:42.302
Well...

01:05:43.914 --> 01:05:47.406
Well, if he... if he won't pick up
the gun, just shoot him.

01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:48.747
Go ahead and shoot him.

01:05:48.819 --> 01:05:51.049
Pick it up, you hear me?!

01:05:53.591 --> 01:05:56.959
Now, I tell you, if I were you...
if you look at his eyes now...

01:05:57.028 --> 01:06:01.226
I would just take hold of this little thing
right here and blow his head off!

01:06:05.504 --> 01:06:11.307
Listen, if I were you,
I would just right now

01:06:11.377 --> 01:06:14.608
blow one bullet,
right in him, right here.

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:17.672
Right here. Just blow his head off.

01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:19.980
Now you want to, don't you?
Don't you want to?

01:06:20.052 --> 01:06:21.110
Shut up, you!

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.658
He's getting away.
You kill him now.

01:06:28.729 --> 01:06:31.493
Now, damn it,
you go shoot him in that back!

01:06:36.805 --> 01:06:40.400
Why did you let him get away?
I want you to tell me that.

01:06:40.475 --> 01:06:43.273
But... no, no, I know.
l... I know.

01:06:43.344 --> 01:06:46.677
I know you were just...
you're just waiting for him to turn around

01:06:46.748 --> 01:06:48.717
so you can shoot him
in the back, weren't you?

01:06:49.585 --> 01:06:53.919
See? You don't know that I know
that's the way they do!

01:06:53.989 --> 01:06:59.222
They... they wait, and then,
ah, they... turn around

01:06:59.295 --> 01:07:03.096
and they shoot them in the back!
That's what they do.

01:07:04.668 --> 01:07:06.158
My God...

01:07:07.571 --> 01:07:10.404
That's... I know,
that's what you waitin' for.

01:07:13.610 --> 01:07:19.345
If he... if he would have just...
got this gun!

01:07:19.417 --> 01:07:22.147
Damn near as crazy as you are.

01:07:24.222 --> 01:07:28.956
You... you just seek him, you know,
you just pick it up and go pow!

01:08:14.376 --> 01:08:15.536
Cain?

01:08:21.250 --> 01:08:22.581
It is Cain.

01:08:22.652 --> 01:08:24.051
You livin' around here?

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:26.452
I have my own place now.

01:08:26.522 --> 01:08:29.354
- Still painting?
- Still painting.

01:08:29.425 --> 01:08:32.589
You still look hungry and beat,
just like the first time I saw you.

01:08:32.662 --> 01:08:34.961
What happened
with the shooting show?

01:08:35.032 --> 01:08:36.363
Oh, I left.

01:08:36.433 --> 01:08:38.594
Are you sure
you weren't fired again?

01:08:40.636 --> 01:08:42.729
I need help
unloading my buckboard.

01:08:42.805 --> 01:08:45.001
It's filled with a month's supply
of shopping.

01:08:45.075 --> 01:08:48.068
Your services for all you can eat?

01:08:48.145 --> 01:08:49.374
Is it a deal?

01:08:49.447 --> 01:08:51.278
It's a deal.

01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:33.224
If you'll unload the stuff,
I'll get supper ready.

01:10:04.128 --> 01:10:07.393
I haven't eaten that good
in a long time. Thanks.

01:10:07.464 --> 01:10:08.988
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

01:10:42.869 --> 01:10:46.032
Your face is so difficult to draw!
It's so complicated!

01:10:47.908 --> 01:10:50.741
Like my life.
And yours.

01:10:50.811 --> 01:10:51.903
Why mine?

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:57.741
Well, it seems to me this is a hard life
for a lady like you.

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.021
Must be a reason you live like this.

01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:04.456
- Like what?
- Alone.

01:11:06.661 --> 01:11:08.994
The only reason is
because I like it this way.

01:11:09.064 --> 01:11:11.055
Heaven knows I don't have to.

01:11:11.133 --> 01:11:14.967
Don't you miss
those big cities back east?

01:11:15.037 --> 01:11:18.564
No. I was born out here.

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:25.313
My father came out here in '49,
first gold rush.

01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:28.544
Took him ten years,
he finally struck it rich.

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:34.216
So did my father.
Came looking for gold, I mean.

01:11:35.359 --> 01:11:36.690
What happened?

01:11:38.429 --> 01:11:42.160
The only gold he got
was three chevrons on his sleeve.

01:11:42.233 --> 01:11:44.895
- I mean, what happened to you.
- Me?

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:51.074
I was raised around army forts.
The only time I saw my father

01:11:51.143 --> 01:11:53.907
was in between details,
and usually he was just soberin' up

01:11:53.979 --> 01:11:55.810
when it was time to leave again.

01:11:57.482 --> 01:11:59.541
And then one day
he didn't come back.

01:12:00.686 --> 01:12:05.089
The Major said he died,
but I think he deserted.

01:12:05.158 --> 01:12:06.785
What about your mother?

01:12:08.027 --> 01:12:10.188
I never saw her, that I remember.

01:12:11.130 --> 01:12:12.620
How different...

01:12:14.768 --> 01:12:18.568
My father sold his mine interests,
packed up my mother and me,

01:12:18.639 --> 01:12:22.541
and took us back east,
where we lived in complete comfort.

01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:25.510
Imagine what
it would have been like

01:12:25.579 --> 01:12:28.014
if your father had struck it rich
and mine hadn't.

01:12:29.984 --> 01:12:31.144
I can't.

01:12:33.221 --> 01:12:36.384
Well, l... I guess
I'd better be going.

01:12:50.739 --> 01:12:53.732
- Thanks again.
- You're welcome any time, Cain.

01:14:32.783 --> 01:14:34.114
What are you doing?

01:14:35.919 --> 01:14:37.911
Morning.
Hold that end up, will you?

01:14:40.958 --> 01:14:42.789
I thought you left last night.

01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:45.226
Well, I started to,
but you filled me up so good

01:14:45.296 --> 01:14:48.163
that I didn't much feel
like making the ride back to Las Rinas.

01:14:48.232 --> 01:14:50.224
You're lettin' it drag.
Raise it higher.

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:57.603
You know, this place could be fixed up.

01:14:57.676 --> 01:14:59.735
The land around here
could support stock.

01:15:03.083 --> 01:15:04.243
There you are.

01:15:05.985 --> 01:15:09.921
I was thinking last night...
or maybe I was dreaming, but...

01:15:09.989 --> 01:15:12.219
I know I could do something
with this place.

01:15:15.862 --> 01:15:17.694
That would mean a lot to you,
wouldn't it, Cain?

01:15:17.765 --> 01:15:19.756
I'd pay you rent as soon as I could.

01:15:20.768 --> 01:15:22.599
That wouldn't be good business
on my part.

01:15:22.670 --> 01:15:24.001
You'd have to pay me first.

01:15:25.206 --> 01:15:28.869
- You know I can't do that.
- Oh, yes you can.

01:15:34.516 --> 01:15:36.677
Would you please hold still?

01:15:37.853 --> 01:15:40.583
I'm sorry, Cain, but it just isn't right.

01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:44.986
Damn it, Monica, I'm not posing anymore.
There's work to be done.

01:15:45.061 --> 01:15:46.961
If you don't pose, you can clear out.

01:15:56.607 --> 01:15:59.098
For Heaven's sake, of course!

01:16:02.379 --> 01:16:05.439
- Look, I think I'd better do the shaving.
- No, this is fun!

01:16:24.236 --> 01:16:25.567
Mr. Ruffalo.

01:16:27.573 --> 01:16:28.972
Mr. Ruffalo!

01:16:54.435 --> 01:16:56.699
- Mr. Ruffalo!
- Yeah?

01:16:58.072 --> 01:17:02.066
- I'm looking for Cain.
- So am I.

01:17:02.144 --> 01:17:05.238
He up and left me
a couple of months back.

01:17:05.314 --> 01:17:07.145
Would you have any idea
where he might have gone?

01:17:07.216 --> 01:17:08.478
Who's askin'?

01:17:12.788 --> 01:17:14.381
An attorney, huh?

01:17:15.492 --> 01:17:18.689
Well, it's like I told you,
I'm looking for him, too.

01:17:22.465 --> 01:17:24.592
I think you've made
a little mistake here.

01:17:25.502 --> 01:17:28.336
Clay Allison died
under the wheels of a wagon.

01:17:28.405 --> 01:17:31.431
- He was drunk.
- You don't say.

01:17:39.885 --> 01:17:43.480
You're an attorney?
Who's got himself hung recently?

01:18:35.411 --> 01:18:37.402
Need anything from town?

01:18:37.479 --> 01:18:39.447
No. Is that where you're going?

01:18:39.515 --> 01:18:42.109
I gotta pick up some nails and a flint.

01:18:42.184 --> 01:18:44.448
Say, those flowers are looking great.

01:18:44.521 --> 01:18:46.580
Everything around here does.

01:18:49.593 --> 01:18:50.924
When will you be back?

01:18:50.994 --> 01:18:52.985
I'll be back in time for dinner.

01:19:17.689 --> 01:19:19.748
I've been working out there
for over a month.

01:19:19.825 --> 01:19:22.794
All I can say is I'm sorry,
but we require some collateral.

01:19:22.861 --> 01:19:24.124
But it's fertile land!

01:19:24.197 --> 01:19:25.789
With a small amount of livestock,

01:19:25.865 --> 01:19:28.356
I know I could make it
a good ranch in no time.

01:19:28.434 --> 01:19:31.062
I'm sure you could,
but we can't loan you the money.

01:19:31.137 --> 01:19:32.968
Because I'm Cain.

01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:37.804
To be frank, you'd be a poor risk.
But that's not the main reason.

01:19:37.878 --> 01:19:39.903
We ask collateral of everyone.

01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:41.971
If Miss Alton would put up her deed
on the property,

01:19:42.049 --> 01:19:44.381
we'd be glad to make the loan
for livestock.

01:19:44.451 --> 01:19:47.443
No, sir, she's got nothing
to do with this.

01:19:47.521 --> 01:19:48.783
It's her land.

01:19:48.856 --> 01:19:51.223
But it's me that's gonna
make something out of it.

01:19:52.293 --> 01:19:55.091
Tell me something, Cain, what
have you done since you got released?

01:19:55.163 --> 01:19:58.189
Possibly I can find
some related work for you.

01:19:58.266 --> 01:19:59.858
Well, I've had a lot of odd jobs,

01:19:59.934 --> 01:20:03.962
but only two things that lasted
for any length of time.

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:07.532
I was a bouncer,
and I did some shooting on a show.

01:20:07.610 --> 01:20:09.510
With Ruffalo, of course.

01:20:09.578 --> 01:20:10.943
You know Ruffalo?

01:20:11.013 --> 01:20:13.709
We loaned him the money
to buy that circus wagon of his.

01:20:13.783 --> 01:20:16.014
Do you happen to know
where he is now?

01:20:16.086 --> 01:20:19.112
As a matter of fact,
I ran into him last week in Prescott.

01:21:18.586 --> 01:21:22.148
Well, kid, he's back with us,
starting tomorrow.

01:21:22.224 --> 01:21:24.419
- He is, is he?
- Yeah.

01:21:24.493 --> 01:21:27.428
Say, listen, uh,
what'd he have to say?

01:21:27.496 --> 01:21:31.262
I mean... did he... did he go into, uh,
any reasons why he left...

01:21:31.333 --> 01:21:34.599
No. No, I didn't ask.

01:21:34.670 --> 01:21:37.468
All that matters is that he's back.

01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:41.874
And we're gonna start
taking in that big money again.

01:21:52.856 --> 01:21:56.019
Where's the big box
we put the spent shells in?

01:21:56.093 --> 01:21:58.084
It's behind the barrel.

01:22:04.536 --> 01:22:08.028
Cain?
What'd you come back for?

01:22:08.106 --> 01:22:09.437
For money.

01:22:12.945 --> 01:22:13.969
Wait.

01:22:18.551 --> 01:22:20.143
Did you...

01:22:21.887 --> 01:22:24.151
...say anything to Ruffalo
about what happened?

01:22:24.223 --> 01:22:27.716
No, I didn't.
And I don't intend to.

01:22:29.930 --> 01:22:31.761
You know,
I wanna tell you something.

01:22:31.832 --> 01:22:37.896
I can't see how both you and me
can be in this show.

01:22:39.841 --> 01:22:43.504
I was hoping old man Carson
would fix things once and for all,

01:22:43.578 --> 01:22:46.069
but he didn't, so I guess
I'll have to call you myself.

01:22:47.715 --> 01:22:49.205
Now go get your gun.

01:22:51.385 --> 01:22:54.116
What's the matter, old man?
I'm calling you! Go get your gun.

01:22:54.189 --> 01:22:56.180
It's back there on the wagon.
Now go get it!

01:22:56.258 --> 01:22:58.419
Go on, old man, go get your gun.

01:23:04.266 --> 01:23:06.098
Put that thing away, Billy.

01:23:08.171 --> 01:23:11.834
Well, okay, I will put it away.

01:23:11.908 --> 01:23:14.843
I will put it away.
It is put away.

01:23:15.845 --> 01:23:18.006
'Cause I'm just playing.

01:23:18.082 --> 01:23:21.540
Hey, you aren't afraid of a kid
who's just playing, are you?

01:23:22.319 --> 01:23:25.220
You know, you're right,
it doesn't have to be right now.

01:23:26.056 --> 01:23:27.387
But it's gonna be.

01:23:31.429 --> 01:23:35.456
"Killer."
"Killer Cain."

01:23:40.038 --> 01:23:42.370
What'd you do?
You shoot them all on the back?

01:24:02.362 --> 01:24:04.296
You're breaking my hand!

01:24:05.599 --> 01:24:06.759
You're breaking my hand!

01:24:06.833 --> 01:24:10.463
That's right, boy.
I could break your hand right now.

01:24:11.039 --> 01:24:13.200
And then where would you be, huh?

01:24:13.274 --> 01:24:15.902
Don't you ever try me again.
I've had it with you.

01:24:15.977 --> 01:24:19.310
I'll quit this show
when I'm damn good and ready.

01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:24.318
And the next time you talk to me,
you say "Mr. Cain." Understand?

01:24:58.723 --> 01:25:00.714
Why didn't you tell me
you were leaving?

01:25:02.828 --> 01:25:05.319
I didn't plan to.
It just worked out that way.

01:25:06.331 --> 01:25:09.892
When you didn't come back,
I went in to Las Rinas and asked around.

01:25:09.968 --> 01:25:12.937
Bill Grayley at the bank said
he thought you might be here.

01:25:13.705 --> 01:25:15.697
You don't have to do this,
you know?

01:25:18.244 --> 01:25:20.508
It's the only way I know
to earn money.

01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:21.808
I'll stake you.

01:25:21.881 --> 01:25:25.510
No. I couldn't do that.

01:25:30.824 --> 01:25:34.783
One wouldn't know it,
looking at you in that getup.

01:25:36.163 --> 01:25:37.892
You're a very proud man.

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:41.131
I love you.

01:25:41.201 --> 01:25:42.760
You know that.

01:25:45.073 --> 01:25:47.735
And I love you, too.

01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:50.744
But please try to understand
why I have to do this.

01:25:50.812 --> 01:25:53.804
It's not the best way for a man
to make a living, but it's honest.

01:25:53.882 --> 01:25:57.011
I just want to make enough money
to buy some livestock,

01:25:57.086 --> 01:25:58.576
and then we'll be married.

01:26:07.831 --> 01:26:10.356
Who ever would have thought
back in Boston...

01:26:11.935 --> 01:26:15.769
...l'd be saying "yes"
in a cheap hotel room in Arizona...

01:26:17.007 --> 01:26:19.669
...to a tall gunslinger in black.

01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:34.125
Listen, that's the southbound.
I'll make you a deal.

01:26:35.327 --> 01:26:37.261
You catch it, go back to Las Rinas,

01:26:37.329 --> 01:26:39.695
and I'll come back to you
as soon as I can.

01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:42.892
It's a deal.

01:26:47.273 --> 01:26:50.140
Keep your hands off of that.
That's Cain's share!

01:26:50.210 --> 01:26:53.611
That's Cain's share, yeah.

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:56.376
And which one is mine?
Don't tell me!

01:26:56.449 --> 01:26:58.610
The little one is mine.

01:26:58.685 --> 01:27:00.415
Yes, that's yours.

01:27:00.488 --> 01:27:03.048
- Big one is yours.
- That's right.

01:27:03.124 --> 01:27:07.026
This is my show, Billy,
and I pay a man exactly what he's worth...

01:27:07.094 --> 01:27:08.584
no more, no less.

01:27:09.797 --> 01:27:13.290
It may be your show,
but I am the star, and you know it.

01:27:13.368 --> 01:27:17.361
You was, Billy, you was,
until Cain come along.

01:27:17.439 --> 01:27:19.498
Twice as many people
are paying to see him.

01:27:19.574 --> 01:27:20.836
He's earned his share.

01:27:20.909 --> 01:27:22.706
He's earned his share.

01:27:22.777 --> 01:27:25.268
I wanna tell you something.
You know why he came back?

01:27:25.347 --> 01:27:26.838
He's in here for just one big one.

01:27:26.916 --> 01:27:29.441
Then you know what that scarred-assed
son of a bitch is gonna do?

01:27:29.519 --> 01:27:31.180
He's gonna take a walk!

01:27:31.254 --> 01:27:34.746
No, he ain't gonna walk away
from all that money, Billy.

01:27:34.824 --> 01:27:38.055
The only one who's gonna walk
is gonna be you,

01:27:38.127 --> 01:27:40.824
if you don't like the way
I'm running things.

01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:46.064
Hell, I can find me half a dozen
sharp shootin' youngsters.

01:27:46.136 --> 01:27:49.537
But I'm never gonna be able
to find me another Cain.

01:27:49.606 --> 01:27:52.599
Hell, you know
there's no one better than me.

01:27:52.677 --> 01:27:55.544
Maybe not, Billy, maybe not.
But you ain't a killer.

01:27:55.613 --> 01:27:58.673
How many times
do I gotta tell you, kid?

01:27:58.816 --> 01:28:00.306
People want to see a killer.

01:28:00.385 --> 01:28:02.876
They pay to see Cain
because he's a killer.

01:28:02.954 --> 01:28:04.786
Now you...

01:28:04.857 --> 01:28:07.018
you ain't nothin'.

01:28:07.092 --> 01:28:09.322
Just a little pissant.

01:28:15.301 --> 01:28:18.032
So that's what I gotta be, huh?

01:28:19.439 --> 01:28:20.770
A killer!

01:28:22.876 --> 01:28:24.969
All right, Rufe, I'll be a killer.

01:28:28.181 --> 01:28:30.776
If that's what I gotta be, I'll be one.

01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:33.580
Killer.

01:29:00.450 --> 01:29:02.111
Oh, God...

01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:06.081
I am a killer, Rufe.

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:55.171
Ruffalo?

01:29:59.012 --> 01:30:01.003
I come for my money.

01:31:20.334 --> 01:31:21.733
All that yours?

01:31:23.036 --> 01:31:26.199
Yeah, it sure is.

01:31:32.379 --> 01:31:34.712
That's a lot of money
for a kid like you.

01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:36.812
I could sure use it.

01:31:40.688 --> 01:31:44.180
You know, I don't think
that you know who I am.

01:31:44.259 --> 01:31:45.419
Nope.

01:31:45.493 --> 01:31:46.927
Billy Valen.

01:31:50.266 --> 01:31:52.063
I'm Little Boy Blue.

01:31:53.035 --> 01:31:56.198
I like that! I really do.

01:31:56.272 --> 01:31:59.070
I really like that.
You're a very funny man.

01:31:59.643 --> 01:32:01.941
Now, Mr. Funnyman...

01:32:03.847 --> 01:32:05.405
Have you heard of, uh...

01:32:07.617 --> 01:32:10.108
...Dan Ruffalo's Shooting Show?

01:32:14.725 --> 01:32:16.386
I...

01:32:18.563 --> 01:32:21.259
...just happen to be the star.

01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:24.794
That's right, I'm the star.

01:32:28.707 --> 01:32:31.835
Now you say
that you can use that, huh?

01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:34.003
Is that right?

01:32:36.548 --> 01:32:37.947
There it is.

01:32:41.087 --> 01:32:43.351
Now, if you think
that you can take it, why...

01:32:46.259 --> 01:32:47.317
...take it.

01:33:01.408 --> 01:33:04.674
Have you ever seen anything that fast?

01:33:29.772 --> 01:33:31.832
Didn't anyone ever tell you, boy?

01:33:34.177 --> 01:33:36.668
Never holster an empty gun.

01:33:46.658 --> 01:33:50.651
You're not... you're not
gonna shoot me, are you?

01:33:50.728 --> 01:33:53.424
You bet your ass I'm gonna.

01:34:03.175 --> 01:34:08.636
l... I don't wanna die, mister...

01:34:18.858 --> 01:34:22.522
He-help me! Help me...

01:37:12.112 --> 01:37:14.103
Now laugh.

01:37:15.048 --> 01:37:17.448
Go on, laugh.

01:37:17.518 --> 01:37:19.748
Like you did in the mine, uh?

01:37:34.636 --> 01:37:37.127
Everything around here
looks real nice.

01:37:37.205 --> 01:37:39.197
Your husband's done a great job.

01:37:39.275 --> 01:37:41.675
Thank you, Mr. Grayley.
We're very happy.

01:37:41.744 --> 01:37:43.234
I'm sure you are.

01:37:43.312 --> 01:37:45.780
You know, folks up north
sort of consider him as a hero

01:37:45.848 --> 01:37:48.078
for bringing in Luke Santee
like he did.

01:37:48.150 --> 01:37:50.084
It's ironic, isn't it?

01:37:50.152 --> 01:37:53.145
Well, looks like you have company.
I'll be going.

01:37:53.223 --> 01:37:54.554
Thank you for dropping by.

01:37:54.624 --> 01:37:56.285
- Bye now.
- Bye.

01:38:25.958 --> 01:38:27.357
Is your husband around, ma'am?

01:38:27.426 --> 01:38:29.155
Why, yes, he's in the back.

01:38:30.463 --> 01:38:32.055
Here he comes now.

01:38:44.678 --> 01:38:46.669
Hi, there.
What can I do for you?

01:38:46.747 --> 01:38:48.908
It's what I can do for you.

01:38:48.983 --> 01:38:51.417
I've been looking for you
for quite some time.

01:39:03.031 --> 01:39:04.191
Why?!

01:39:04.266 --> 01:39:05.290
- Why, why?!
- Why?

01:39:05.367 --> 01:39:07.858
All right, I'll tell you why.

01:39:07.936 --> 01:39:11.429
Because 20 years ago,
Cain killed my father.

01:39:11.507 --> 01:39:14.067
He served 18 years in prison.

01:39:14.143 --> 01:39:16.805
No, that was the price of one life.

01:39:16.879 --> 01:39:19.211
Cain took 12.

01:39:23.086 --> 01:39:26.419
Oh, no!
