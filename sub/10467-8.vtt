AND YOU KNOW WHAT, SARAH?

27:31.214 --> 27:33.608

LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.680

28:37.411 --> 28:38.629
WHICH IS NOT
EVEN THE POINT.

28:38.629 --> 28:40.240
BECAUSE DIANA
WANTS HER MOM.

28:40.240 --> 28:41.502
SO, TIRED OR NOT,

28:41.502 --> 28:43.156
WHY ARE YOU NOT

28:43.156 --> 28:45.027
INSTEAD OF CALLING

BECAUSE SHE'S
TOO NICE TO SAY NO?

28:47.377 --> 28:48.465

IF YOU WANT TO YELL
AT SOMEBODY,

28:52.295 --> 28:53.557
GO YELL AT KIRSTEN,

28:53.557 --> 28:55.168
BECAUSE
SHE JUST CAME OVER.

28:55.168 --> 28:56.386
I DIDN'T CALL HER.

28:57.779 --> 29:03.742
I AM GOING BACK
TO SLEEP NOW. UNH.

29:06.614 --> 29:09.791
I KNEW THIS GUY WHO KEPT
A FERRET TO CATCH RATS

29:09.791 --> 29:11.097
BECAUSE
THEY'RE PREDATORS.

29:11.097 --> 29:13.664
REALLY?
FERRET'S A PREDATOR.

29:13.664 --> 29:15.841
HMM. KIND OF
DISAPPOINTED IN THEM.

29:15.841 --> 29:17.799
NO, DON'T BE.
IT JUST MEANS
HE'LL BE OK

29:17.799 --> 29:19.279
OUT ALONE IN THE FOREST.

29:19.279 --> 29:21.107
WELL, IT WORKED
FOR THOREAU.

29:21.107 --> 29:22.108

29:23.109 --> 29:24.806
OH, NEVER MIND.

HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
UH, LOOK, CLAUD, I--

29:26.677 --> 29:28.592
I GOT TO GET BACK
TO THE AIRPORT.

29:28.592 --> 29:30.551
WHEN FREE FLIGHT COURIER
FINDS OUT I'VE
BOTCHED THIS,

29:30.551 --> 29:32.988
THEY'RE
PROBABLY GOING TO TRY
TO CANCEL MY FLIGHT.

29:32.988 --> 29:35.425
I CAN'T REALLY GET
STUCK HERE, YOU KNOW?

29:35.425 --> 29:38.428
WELL, YOU KNOW,
GIVE OWEN A HUG FOR ME

29:38.428 --> 29:40.169
AND KISS DIANA.

29:40.169 --> 29:41.997

29:45.000 --> 29:48.003

YOU CAME, IT JUST--

29:48.003 --> 29:50.005

FEEL A LITTLE WORSE.

30:57.507 --> 30:59.814
GET THIS, NED.

30:59.814 --> 31:02.121
YESTERDAY AT YOUR HOUSE,
I FED RICHIE A VERSE

31:02.121 --> 31:03.557
THAT I FOUND
AT THE LIBRARY,

31:03.557 --> 31:04.863
AND I THINK HE ACTUALLY
ANSWERED ME BACK.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.038
LOOK AT WHAT I FOUND.

31:06.038 --> 31:08.301
HE WASN'T ANSWERING YOU.

31:08.301 --> 31:10.129
WHEN CLAUDIA AND I
WERE LITTLE, WE USED
TO MAKE UP LANGUAGES,

31:10.129 --> 31:11.608
AND WE UNDERSTOOD
EACH OTHER.

31:11.608 --> 31:13.219
THERE'S NOTHING
TO UNDERSTAND.

31:13.219 --> 31:15.569
NO, THERE IS.
I'M--I'M SURE OF IT.

31:15.569 --> 31:18.920
THE POETRY, HE, LIKE,
USES BITS AND PIECES
TO EXPRESS THINGS,

31:18.920 --> 31:20.704
WHICH MAKES HIM
LIKE A POET HIMSELF.

31:20.704 --> 31:22.054
JULIA--

31:22.054 --> 31:23.838
NO, LISTEN, NED,
THAT POEM AT THE HOUSE,

31:23.838 --> 31:25.144
THAT WAS ABOUT
MAKING UP WITH ME.

31:25.144 --> 31:26.710
I LOOKED UP
ALL THOSE POEMS AND--

31:26.710 --> 31:28.016
THE POEM AT THE HOUSE

31:28.016 --> 31:29.713
WAS NOT ABOUT
MAKING UP WITH YOU!

31:29.713 --> 31:31.498
IT WASN'T ABOUT ANYTHING!

31:36.459 --> 31:38.766
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

31:38.766 --> 31:40.507
WELL, YOU COME IN HERE

31:40.507 --> 31:42.335

WORKING IT OUT,

31:42.335 --> 31:44.990
BUT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

31:44.990 --> 31:47.731
WHY ARE YOU
SO CRAZY DEFENSIVE?

31:47.731 --> 31:50.604
DOES THE IDEA THAT
RICHIE MIGHT ACTUALLY
BE MAKING SENSE

31:50.604 --> 31:51.953
THREATEN YOU SO MUCH--

31:51.953 --> 31:54.260
THREATEN ME?
DO--DO YOU THINK...

31:54.260 --> 31:56.436
I HAVEN'T WANTED
MY WHOLE LIFE

31:56.436 --> 31:58.873
FOR--FOR RICHIE
TO MAKE SENSE?

32:00.570 --> 32:01.920

SOMETHING.

32:15.498 --> 32:17.805
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.I JUST THOUGHT--

32:17.805 --> 32:20.677
HE MIGHT AS WELL
BE SPEWING TRAIN SCHEDULES.

32:20.677 --> 32:22.897
IT'S WHITE NOISE.

32:22.897 --> 32:26.074
I JUST HAD THIS IDEA.
I WAS OBVIOUSLY WRONG.

32:26.074 --> 32:27.815
YOU'RE LOOKING...

32:29.251 --> 32:30.861
FOR SOMETHING
THAT WOULD...

32:32.820 --> 32:35.475
MAKE HIM WORTHY OF LOVE.

32:37.912 --> 32:38.826
THE THING IS...

32:40.349 --> 32:45.833
THE REASON TO LOVE HIM
IS JUST BECAUSE...

32:45.833 --> 32:46.834
HE'S HIM.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.203
I DON'T THINK I'VE
EVER HAD A BIRTHDAY...

38:56.203 --> 38:59.554

BROKE MY PIÑATA,
SCARED OFF MY FRIENDS.

39:15.527 --> 39:16.615

AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

40:23.551 --> 40:24.683
HEY.

40:26.119 --> 40:28.121
HEY.

40:28.121 --> 40:29.688
BEEN DOWNSTAIRS?

40:31.211 --> 40:34.040
TRIED TALKING
TO CLAUDIA AGAIN.

40:34.040 --> 40:36.521
A BIG WASTE OF TIME.

40:36.521 --> 40:41.003
SHE KEEPS TALKING
ABOUT WHAT A BIG HELP
SHE'S GONNA BE WITH DIANA.

40:41.003 --> 40:43.615
IT'S NOT THAT
WE CAN'T USE IT.

40:43.615 --> 40:46.052
WE CAN HANDLE IT.

40:46.052 --> 40:48.924
WE GOTTA HANDLE IT.

40:48.924 --> 40:53.973
YEAH, I'VE BEEN WANTING
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT.

40:53.973 --> 40:55.844
UM...

40:55.844 --> 40:57.498
I CALLED THE AGENCY,

40:57.498 --> 41:01.415
AND...THE ONLY NAME
THEY COULD COME UP WITH

41:01.415 --> 41:02.982
WAS MARGARET.

41:02.982 --> 41:06.072
SO I TOLD THEM THAT
I WOULD CALL THEM BACK

41:06.072 --> 41:07.552
BECAUSE I KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HER.

41:07.552 --> 41:10.032
HOW I FEEL ABOUT HER.

41:10.032 --> 41:11.904
GO AHEAD,
HIT THE ROOF.

41:11.904 --> 41:13.906
I AM TIRED
OF HITTING THE ROOF,

41:13.906 --> 41:15.951
BUT, DAPHNE...

41:17.387 --> 41:18.867
MARGARET?

41:18.867 --> 41:19.912
SOMEBODY.

41:21.870 --> 41:25.439
OR ANYBODY, RIGHT?

41:25.439 --> 41:29.922
YOU'RE, LIKE, WILLING
TO HAND OFF DIANA
TO ANYONE.

41:29.922 --> 41:31.271
YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT WHAT SHE EATS.

41:31.271 --> 41:33.055
YOU FORGET
ABOUT HER MEDICINE.

41:33.055 --> 41:35.362
ALL YOU WANT TO DO
IS SLEEP.

41:35.362 --> 41:38.321
I KEEP TELLING MYSELF
THAT IT'S--THAT IT'S
POSTPARTUM OR SOMETHING,

41:38.321 --> 41:40.802
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S...NOT IT.

41:41.977 --> 41:42.848
THERE'S...

41:44.197 --> 41:45.590
THERE'S SOMETHING...

41:48.114 --> 41:49.028
THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG.

41:52.901 --> 41:55.077
SHE'S YOUR BABY, DAPH,

41:55.077 --> 41:57.079
AND I DON'T EVEN THINK
THAT YOU KNOW THAT.

41:57.079 --> 42:01.083
I MEAN, YOU ACT LIKE
YOU'RE NOT CONNECTED
TO HER AT ALL.

42:01.083 --> 42:02.824
BECAUSE THAT'S
THE WAY I FEEL.

42:02.824 --> 42:04.173
DAPHNE...

42:04.173 --> 42:05.827
I MEAN IT.

42:05.827 --> 42:07.525
I MEAN, GOD,
I LOOK AT YOU

42:07.525 --> 42:09.309
WHEN YOU COME THROUGH THAT DOOR
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

42:09.309 --> 42:11.964
AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
JUST BURSTING TO BE WITH HER.

42:11.964 --> 42:14.836
AND I KNOW THAT
YOU SPENT THE ENTIRE DAY

42:14.836 --> 42:17.186
COUNTING DOWN EVERY MINUTE
BEFORE YOU GET TO COME HOME,

42:17.186 --> 42:18.971
AND I HATE MYSELF

42:18.971 --> 42:22.409
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I HAVE
SPENT THE EXACT AMOUNT OF TIME

42:22.409 --> 42:27.457
JUST IMAGINING THAT
I WAS SOMEPLACE ELSE.

42:30.939 --> 42:33.725
YOU LOOK INTO HER EYES...

42:33.725 --> 42:36.118
AND YOU SEE FIRST STEPS,

42:36.118 --> 42:38.120
AND YOU SEE
BALLET RECITALS,

42:38.120 --> 42:38.991
AND I SEE...

42:40.819 --> 42:43.604
DIAPERS AND CRYING.

42:43.604 --> 42:45.388
GOD, ALL THAT CRYING!

42:48.870 --> 42:51.960
AND I KNOW THAT WHEN I
FIRST GOT PREGNANT,

42:51.960 --> 42:54.006
YOU SAID THAT IF I
COULDN'T HANDLE THIS

42:54.006 --> 42:55.355
THAT IT WOULD BE OK.

42:57.183 --> 43:01.753
BUT YOU DIDN'T REALLY THINK
THAT IT WOULD BE OK.

43:04.712 --> 43:07.410
YOU THOUGHT THAT ONCE
DIANA WAS BORN

43:07.410 --> 43:11.850
THAT I WOULD JUST
HAVE TO LOOK INTO
THAT TINY LITTLE FACE

43:11.850 --> 43:14.592
WITH YOUR HAZEL EYES
AND MY CROOKED CHIN...

43:17.072 --> 43:18.508
AND THAT WOULD BE IT.

43:20.772 --> 43:23.905
AND THAT WE WOULD JUST LIVE
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

43:27.517 --> 43:29.389
AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
CHARLIE?

43:29.389 --> 43:31.870
DEEP DOWN INSIDE...

43:31.870 --> 43:33.872
I THOUGHT THE SAME THING.

43:37.310 --> 43:41.749
BUT THAT IS NOT HAPPENING.

43:45.797 --> 43:47.102
CHARLIE.

43:48.408 --> 43:50.018
[BABY CRIES]

43:50.018 --> 43:51.106
SHE'S CRYING.

43:57.939 --> 44:00.289
SEE, I DIDN'T EVEN
HEAR HER.
