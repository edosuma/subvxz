Well, I'm sure
you will in no time.

17:36.950 --> 17:39.020
All right, here we go home.

17:39.050 --> 17:41.620
(soft music)

17:57.370 --> 18:00.480
Well, I had a great
first day at work.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.910
The ladies, they're so nice,

18:02.940 --> 18:05.980
Kathy and, um...

18:06.080 --> 18:07.480
Susan.

18:07.580 --> 18:10.590
Well, I just got such
a tickle out of all of them.

18:11.950 --> 18:13.490
Cody, eat your dinner.

18:14.720 --> 18:15.920
I'm not hungry.

18:15.990 --> 18:17.990
Well, try to eat a little.

18:18.090 --> 18:21.330
(phone ringing)

18:21.430 --> 18:23.560
(ominous music)

18:27.230 --> 18:29.940
(ringing continues)

18:34.680 --> 18:38.180
The troll was twice as big as
the biggest Billy goat gruff,

18:38.280 --> 18:40.180
but the Billy goat
was not afraid.

18:40.280 --> 18:43.420
He lowered his horns
and ran at the troll,

18:43.450 --> 18:45.950
pushing him over the bridge.

18:45.990 --> 18:47.920
The troll screamed with fury

18:47.960 --> 18:49.620
as he fell into the water

18:49.660 --> 18:51.830
and was swept away
by the current.

18:52.790 --> 18:55.260
Then, the biggest
Billy goat gruff

18:55.300 --> 18:57.130
joined his family in the meadow

18:57.160 --> 18:59.170
and told them they
never to worry

18:59.270 --> 19:01.500
about crossing the bridge again.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.640
The end.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.640
Read another one.

19:04.710 --> 19:05.810
Sorry.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.170
The time has come

19:07.270 --> 19:09.840
for counting sheep for little
boys who need their sleep.

19:12.380 --> 19:13.350
Now lie down.

19:13.450 --> 19:14.980
You've got school tomorrow.

19:15.950 --> 19:17.180
Got to get some rest.

19:18.120 --> 19:19.490
Goodnight, sweet prince.

19:26.660 --> 19:29.000
Leave the door open, okay?

19:29.030 --> 19:30.700
[Laura] Okay.

19:30.800 --> 19:31.970
Love you.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.030
[Rick]
Hello, Betty?

19:33.130 --> 19:34.300
Betty Ferguson?

19:34.330 --> 19:35.400
[Betty] Yes, who's this?

19:35.500 --> 19:36.470
[Rick] This is Rick Nelson.

19:36.500 --> 19:37.640
[Betty] Oh, David's brother?

19:37.670 --> 19:39.170
- (laughter)
- [Rick] Yeah.

19:39.210 --> 19:40.340
(phone ringing)

19:40.370 --> 19:41.680
Say, what time do you want me

19:41.740 --> 19:43.240
to pick you up for
the dance Friday night?

19:43.340 --> 19:44.510
[Betty] Oh, well, 8:30
would just be wonderful.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.050
[Rick]
Hey, I found her.

19:46.150 --> 19:48.280
Okay, I'll be there
at 8:30...

19:48.380 --> 19:50.850
- Hello?
- [Man] Laura?

19:52.150 --> 19:53.550
[Harriet Nelson]
I thought my own

19:53.650 --> 19:55.260
Hotpoint dishwasher
was wonderful,

19:55.360 --> 19:57.690
but this new one is
the greatest ever...

19:57.730 --> 20:01.030
[Laura] It uses a new system
of spotless cleansing,

20:01.060 --> 20:02.700
two detergent washes

20:02.730 --> 20:06.030
and a few drops of this
special wetting agent

20:06.100 --> 20:07.700
squirted automatically.

20:07.740 --> 20:10.370
(eerie music)

20:42.900 --> 20:45.570
(water dripping)

20:54.450 --> 20:57.550
(phone ringing)

21:01.720 --> 21:02.820
Hello?

21:02.920 --> 21:03.790
[Mother] Laura.

21:03.890 --> 21:04.990
Mother.

21:05.090 --> 21:06.430
Mother, how could you
give Scott my number?

21:06.490 --> 21:07.630
[Woman] Cody.

21:07.730 --> 21:08.760
[Mother]
Laura, where have you been?

21:08.830 --> 21:10.260
[Laura]
He just called here.

21:10.300 --> 21:11.970
How could you do that?

21:12.070 --> 21:13.430
[Mother] I didn't
give him your number.

21:13.500 --> 21:14.970
I only gave it
to a few of your friends.

21:15.070 --> 21:16.100
Why?

21:16.170 --> 21:17.340
Why would you do that?

21:17.440 --> 21:19.840
I told you
not to give it to anyone.

21:19.940 --> 21:21.170
[Mother]
They're your friends.

21:21.270 --> 21:22.910
Did you give him
my address too?

21:22.940 --> 21:24.110
Is he gonna come here?

21:24.180 --> 21:25.480
[Mother] He's not going
to come there, Laura.

21:25.580 --> 21:27.250
He just wants
to talk to you.

21:27.280 --> 21:28.480
He feels so bad.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.820
I don't care how he feels.

21:30.920 --> 21:33.450
I don't know how you
can even speak to him

21:33.490 --> 21:34.660
after what he did.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.960
You're supposed
to be on our side.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.790
Grandma would be.

21:39.830 --> 21:42.030
[Mother] Of course
we're on your side, Laura.

21:42.130 --> 21:43.430
[Laura] No you're not.

21:43.460 --> 21:44.260
[Mother] Honey, why don't
I come and stay with you

21:44.300 --> 21:45.630
for a while?

21:45.700 --> 21:47.640
[Laura]
No. No.

21:47.700 --> 21:49.500
I don't need any help.
Everything's perfect.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.510
(eerie music)

22:08.960 --> 22:10.890
(Cody screaming)

22:10.990 --> 22:12.990
[Cody] Mom!

22:13.060 --> 22:13.660
[Laura] Cody.

22:13.730 --> 22:14.900
Cody, what's wrong?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.230
[Cody] There was
a monster in my room.

22:16.330 --> 22:18.170
[Laura] It's okay.
It's okay.

22:18.230 --> 22:19.730
You're okay.

22:19.830 --> 22:21.470
[Cody] Mom, the monster
from the pond was in my room!

22:21.500 --> 22:23.470
[Laura] Honey,
there's no monster.

22:23.500 --> 22:24.870
You're just having a bad dream.

22:24.970 --> 22:26.010
[Cody] You're not
listening to me.

22:26.070 --> 22:27.510
It was right here.

22:27.580 --> 22:28.680
[Laura] It doesn't
feel like a dream,

22:28.740 --> 22:31.180
I know,
but it was, I promise.

22:31.210 --> 22:32.550
[Cody] The monster was here.

22:32.650 --> 22:35.150
(soft music)

23:53.430 --> 23:56.300
As I yearn to return to you,

23:56.400 --> 23:59.600
so will you yearn
to return to me.

24:00.970 --> 24:03.170
When our paths do cross again,

24:03.270 --> 24:05.670
our hearts will
entwined with ecstasy.

24:12.350 --> 24:13.610
Laura,

24:13.650 --> 24:16.080
I thought you were
Mrs. Seton's ghost.

24:16.120 --> 24:17.520
No, Grandma.

24:17.620 --> 24:19.120
She doesn't like
it in the attic.

24:19.150 --> 24:21.320
I only ever see her
in the basement.

24:21.420 --> 24:23.120
Me too.

24:23.160 --> 24:25.830
Where did you find
this old thing?

24:29.100 --> 24:31.130
Ugh. Is he really
worth the effort?

24:32.500 --> 24:34.970
Oh, honey, don't cry.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.710
I can't even imagine how hard
it is to be young these days.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.980
It was so much simpler
back in my time.

24:41.010 --> 24:43.540
I wish I could take
you back there with me.

24:44.480 --> 24:45.780
I wish I could too.

24:46.610 --> 24:47.880
You'd fit right in.

24:49.480 --> 24:51.150
[Young Laura]
Thanks, Grandma.

24:51.790 --> 24:54.820
(ethereal music)

25:02.560 --> 25:05.630
(water dripping)

25:14.170 --> 25:15.680
[Receptionist]
This is Dr. Weaver's office.

25:15.740 --> 25:17.180
How may I help you?

25:17.210 --> 25:18.650
Hi, Francine?

25:18.680 --> 25:19.580
It's Laura Butler.

25:19.680 --> 25:20.580
[Francine] Hi, Laura.

25:20.680 --> 25:21.920
We've been trying to reach you.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.020
Oh, Dr. Weaver just
walked in, hold on.

25:24.080 --> 25:26.490
[Dr. Weaver]
Laura, how are you?

25:26.520 --> 25:28.020
Hi, Doctor.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.390
I don't know.

25:32.490 --> 25:33.860
[Dr. Weaver]
What's going on?

25:35.700 --> 25:36.860
Scott called.

25:37.830 --> 25:39.100
[Dr. Weaver] Are you
having the dreams again?

25:39.200 --> 25:40.400
Yeah.

25:40.500 --> 25:44.610
I'm wondering if maybe I
should go back on medication.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.370
[Dr. Weaver] You know,
I prefer we didn't

25:46.440 --> 25:48.210
handle them through medication.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.610
Can you come in today?

25:49.710 --> 25:51.750
No, I'm out of town.

25:51.850 --> 25:53.280
[Dr. Weaver] Where are you?

25:54.180 --> 25:55.220
Laura?

25:56.550 --> 25:57.790
I'm here.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.390
[Dr. Weaver] Where are you?

26:01.190 --> 26:04.760
You know, I think
I'm just being silly.

26:04.860 --> 26:07.130
Everything will be fine.

26:07.230 --> 26:09.800
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Laura?

26:11.870 --> 26:13.400
Cody, hurry up.

26:13.440 --> 26:14.770
We're going to be late.

26:20.910 --> 26:23.240
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

26:24.280 --> 26:25.910
What can I do for you?

26:25.950 --> 26:27.580
Well, I just wanted to
let you know that the,

26:27.610 --> 26:29.780
the kitchen sink was leaking.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.650
So I turned off the water.

26:31.750 --> 26:34.720
Probably just need
your new seed washer.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.390
I'll come by and take a look.

26:37.430 --> 26:38.660
Thank you.

26:38.760 --> 26:43.130
And also the television
sort of popped

26:44.330 --> 26:45.800
and now it's not working.

26:45.900 --> 26:47.940
We're not responsible
for the television.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.770
Well, now, Lenora, I'd go
by and take a look at it.

26:50.800 --> 26:53.610
Well, but she's going to
have to pay for the parts

26:53.640 --> 26:55.410
and the television
was left behind.

26:55.440 --> 26:56.610
It's not part of the house.

26:56.680 --> 26:57.950
That's okay.

26:58.010 --> 27:00.480
If you wouldn't mind
just taking a look.

27:00.580 --> 27:01.620
Will do.

27:01.650 --> 27:02.820
Okay.

27:02.880 --> 27:04.020
Well, have a nice day.

27:04.120 --> 27:05.990
[Mr. Langtree]
You as well, young lady.

27:09.460 --> 27:10.790
That's how it starts.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.790
[Harriet Nelson] I thought
my own Hotpoint dishwasher

27:13.860 --> 27:15.130
was wonderful,

27:15.160 --> 27:17.300
but this new one is
the greatest ever.

27:17.330 --> 27:19.800
It uses a new system
of spotless cleanser,

27:19.870 --> 27:21.470
two detergent washes,

27:21.540 --> 27:24.140
plus a few drops of this
special wetting agent

27:24.170 --> 27:26.510
squirted automatically in
the second rinse water.

27:26.610 --> 27:28.010
And do you know what this does?

27:28.110 --> 27:31.380
It makes it impossible for
water to collect in drops

27:31.480 --> 27:32.510
on your dishes.

27:32.610 --> 27:34.050
You get spotless dry,

27:34.150 --> 27:36.180
even on glasses and silver.

27:36.220 --> 27:38.150
Everything is sparkling clean

27:38.190 --> 27:40.320
when it's washed in a Hotpoint.

27:40.390 --> 27:42.990
(soft music)

27:46.390 --> 27:47.830
[Woman] Cody.

28:03.480 --> 28:06.010
[Man] Turn to the classified
pages of your phone book.

28:06.050 --> 28:07.650
That's where you will find

28:07.680 --> 28:10.150
your nearest Hotpoint dealer.

28:10.180 --> 28:12.350
(soft music)

28:18.730 --> 28:21.360
(eerie music)

28:42.920 --> 28:44.080
- (buzzing)
- Refrigerators,

28:44.180 --> 28:46.250
automatic washers and--

28:47.720 --> 28:51.090
(electricity buzzing)

28:54.030 --> 28:56.900
(dog barking)

29:08.540 --> 29:11.250
(wind blowing)

29:28.600 --> 29:32.130
(Cody breathing heavily)

29:35.440 --> 29:38.140
(wind blowing)

29:43.940 --> 29:49.150
- (eerie music)
- (dog barking)

29:58.960 --> 30:02.030
(eerie whispering)

30:04.670 --> 30:07.470
(wood creaking)

30:09.800 --> 30:12.440
(eerie music)

30:36.030 --> 30:39.000
(eerie droning)

31:18.040 --> 31:20.540
(screaming)

31:42.730 --> 31:43.630
Cody!

31:45.200 --> 31:48.040
(screaming)

31:59.080 --> 32:00.880
(glass breaks)

32:00.910 --> 32:03.950
(Cody screaming)

32:16.830 --> 32:20.000
Cody!

32:23.140 --> 32:25.170
I want to go home.

32:33.410 --> 32:34.110
Amber.

32:34.180 --> 32:35.620
Is this you?

32:35.680 --> 32:36.650
You did this?

32:36.750 --> 32:38.020
Are you sure?

32:50.160 --> 32:51.370
So I thought maybe you

32:51.470 --> 32:52.870
had come by the
house for something.

32:52.970 --> 32:54.870
No, no, probably a raccoon.

32:54.970 --> 32:56.970
They climb all over the place.

32:57.040 --> 32:59.110
Bunch of pests.

32:59.140 --> 33:01.680
No, I don't think
this was a raccoon.

33:01.780 --> 33:05.010
My son said that he saw
something down by the pond.

33:05.110 --> 33:06.510
He's not supposed
to be at the pond.

33:06.610 --> 33:08.010
I don't want him
playing near there.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.720
[Laura] Yes, I know.
I have, uh,

33:09.820 --> 33:11.520
I've already told him
to stay away from it.

33:11.620 --> 33:13.150
I can set some traps
from the raccoons.

33:13.220 --> 33:16.660
Again, I really don't
think it was a raccoon.

33:16.690 --> 33:19.230
So I don't think that
that would be helpful.

33:19.330 --> 33:23.560
Oh, but I did manage
to lock myself out

33:23.660 --> 33:26.000
of the house last night when
I went to investigate and--

33:26.070 --> 33:27.500
Wait, that's impossible.

33:27.540 --> 33:29.200
The door doesn't
lock on its own--

33:29.300 --> 33:30.510
Well, then I
guess it was stuck.

33:30.540 --> 33:31.870
- Well you need--
- Anyway.

33:31.970 --> 33:34.840
I had to break the window
on the door to get in.

33:34.910 --> 33:36.810
So I'm so sorry.

33:36.840 --> 33:37.850
We already fixed the sink.

33:37.910 --> 33:39.080
We're not paying
for that window.

33:39.180 --> 33:40.310
You broke it.

33:40.350 --> 33:43.350
Of course I will
pay for the window.

33:43.380 --> 33:45.490
Anytime you can stop by.

33:45.520 --> 33:46.720
[Mr. Langtree]
Don't you worry.

33:46.820 --> 33:47.760
I'll take care of it.

33:47.860 --> 33:49.090
Thank you.

33:49.190 --> 33:51.530
(soft music)

33:55.760 --> 33:57.100
Hey, how was your day?

33:57.200 --> 33:59.730
(soft music)

34:05.570 --> 34:07.680
You're not still
mad at me, are you?

34:09.510 --> 34:11.850
Honey, I said I was sorry.

34:15.179 --> 34:16.719
How about some ice cream?

34:16.750 --> 34:17.889
Huh?

34:17.920 --> 34:18.889
Yeah.

34:18.920 --> 34:21.860
Cody, why don't you go play?

34:21.889 --> 34:22.719
This looks fun.

34:22.790 --> 34:23.560
Kickball.

34:23.590 --> 34:24.960
Why don't you go play with them?

34:25.060 --> 34:26.560
[Cody] They're friends.

34:26.590 --> 34:28.960
Well, this kid's
all by himself.

34:29.060 --> 34:30.400
He looks like he
could use a friend.

34:30.469 --> 34:31.900
Why don't you go
ask him to play?

34:31.969 --> 34:33.400
[Cody] He's a dipstick.

34:33.469 --> 34:37.100
Well, maybe you could
help him be a better person.

34:37.199 --> 34:38.270
Right?

34:39.239 --> 34:40.909
Go on.
Go ask him to play.

34:40.969 --> 34:42.040
I'll hold your ice cream.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.110
[Cody] I don't want to.

34:43.210 --> 34:44.610
Go on, ask him to play.

34:51.719 --> 34:53.620
(horn honking)

34:53.719 --> 34:56.320
(eerie music)

35:00.730 --> 35:01.760
Let's go.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.400
What happened?
He didn't want to play?

35:03.430 --> 35:04.570
No, I told you, let's go.

35:04.600 --> 35:05.970
Cody, did he say
something to you?

35:06.070 --> 35:07.500
No, God, forget it, okay?

35:07.600 --> 35:08.900
Cody.

35:08.940 --> 35:11.610
(soft music)

35:35.960 --> 35:37.800
Cody, I know you're
not happy here.

35:37.830 --> 35:41.970
We are not going back to
Mesa and you know why.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.470
[Cody] Because you hate Dad.

35:44.510 --> 35:46.210
No, I don't hate Dad.

35:46.310 --> 35:47.610
I hate what Dad did to us.

35:47.640 --> 35:49.880
And I'm going to make very sure

35:49.980 --> 35:51.340
that he can never hurt us again.

35:51.450 --> 35:54.380
Well, I forgive him.

35:59.150 --> 36:01.490
I'm so proud of you for that.

36:04.220 --> 36:05.890
But I'm not ready.

36:08.030 --> 36:09.630
Maybe someday.

36:11.200 --> 36:12.830
In the meantime,

36:12.870 --> 36:16.800
can we try to be
happy living here?

36:18.340 --> 36:20.310
Please?

36:23.880 --> 36:25.850
What you drawing?

36:25.880 --> 36:27.850
The pretty lady.

36:27.920 --> 36:29.420
[Laura] What pretty lady?

36:29.520 --> 36:30.850
From the pond.

36:31.650 --> 36:33.820
I thought you said it
was a monster in the pond.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.660
I thought there was
a monster in the pond,

36:36.690 --> 36:40.860
but then she came to my
room and talked to me.

36:40.900 --> 36:42.700
(eerie music)

36:42.760 --> 36:44.570
Now I understand.

36:48.340 --> 36:50.540
[Laura] Understand what?

36:53.170 --> 36:54.270
Come meet her, Mom.

36:54.370 --> 36:57.040
Come talk to her.

36:57.080 --> 36:58.710
Let's go to the pond.

36:58.750 --> 37:01.380
I don't wanna go to the pond.

37:02.450 --> 37:04.850
Well, then I guess she'll
just have to come to you.

37:05.520 --> 37:07.190
You know what I would love?

37:07.220 --> 37:08.620
I would love it

37:08.720 --> 37:11.560
if you would draw me
a picture of your school or,

37:11.590 --> 37:12.960
or what about a bird?

37:13.060 --> 37:15.560
And we can put your
drawings up on the fridge.

37:17.030 --> 37:18.800
It'll look so nice.

37:18.900 --> 37:21.440
(soft music)

37:47.060 --> 37:50.300
(electricity flickering)

37:50.400 --> 37:52.630
(eerie music)

38:13.590 --> 38:16.960
(electricity buzzing)

38:17.930 --> 38:20.190
(eerie music)

38:20.290 --> 38:23.030
(phone ringing)

38:30.600 --> 38:33.440
(eerie music)

38:43.520 --> 38:45.150
(screaming)

38:45.190 --> 38:47.820
(eerie music)

39:17.450 --> 39:19.820
(gasping)

39:50.120 --> 39:52.190
[Cody] Did you
see the pretty lady?

39:52.220 --> 39:54.090
Did she talk to you, Mom?

39:54.190 --> 39:55.860
Cody, go to sleep.

39:57.560 --> 39:59.060
[Cody] I love you, Mom.

39:59.130 --> 40:01.730
(soft music)

40:18.050 --> 40:19.780
[Laura] Cody.

40:20.920 --> 40:22.750
Cody.

40:22.780 --> 40:24.150
I said lunch was ready.

40:24.250 --> 40:25.920
Okay.

40:29.290 --> 40:30.930
[Laura] That's enough.

40:30.990 --> 40:32.390
Give it back!

40:32.430 --> 40:35.460
(dramatic music)

40:36.300 --> 40:37.930
Cody Richard Butler.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.970
Don't you ever do that again.

40:42.940 --> 40:44.470
Cody.

40:44.570 --> 40:46.240
Why are you so angry at me?

40:47.780 --> 40:49.010
I can't tell you.

40:51.450 --> 40:53.350
Is it about your birthday?

40:53.450 --> 40:55.080
I didn't forget.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.180
[Cody] My birthday?

40:58.150 --> 41:00.820
I was going to ask you
what you wanted to do.

41:04.290 --> 41:06.130
Anything but that.

41:11.130 --> 41:12.630
Hey, I was thinking,

41:12.700 --> 41:14.200
how about we have a party?

41:15.270 --> 41:16.270
We can,

41:16.300 --> 41:17.870
we can have balloons

41:17.970 --> 41:20.440
and ice cream and
cake and presents,

41:20.470 --> 41:23.540
and we can invite
your entire class.

41:24.810 --> 41:28.020
It'll be a gas, right?

41:32.290 --> 41:33.950
Okay.

41:35.660 --> 41:37.390
Okay.

41:38.290 --> 41:40.460
[Harriet Nelson] I don't
mind, though. Keeps him happy.

41:40.490 --> 41:44.470
I'm sure our
Hotpoint refrigerator
doesn't mind either...

41:44.500 --> 41:47.330
Hey, he looks just
like Roy Rogers.

41:47.400 --> 41:49.200
You like Roy Rogers, right?

41:49.970 --> 41:51.310
[Harriet Nelson] I have
a feeling it'll be with us

41:51.340 --> 41:53.670
long after Dave and Ricky
are grown up and married.

41:53.710 --> 41:56.180
And I love the way our
Hotpoint's designed too.

41:56.240 --> 41:58.250
It could've been...

41:58.350 --> 41:59.910
(eerie music)

42:00.010 --> 42:02.380
All the interior arrangements
are so practical.

42:02.480 --> 42:05.090
(eerie music)

42:14.260 --> 42:16.160
Why don't you talk to
your Hotpoint dealer today

42:16.200 --> 42:19.030
about a refrigerator like
this for your family?

42:19.070 --> 42:22.270
[Man] Turn to the classified
pages of your phone book.

42:22.370 --> 42:26.240
That's where you will find
your nearest Hotpoint dealer.

42:26.340 --> 42:28.940
(eerie music)

42:33.420 --> 42:34.880
There.

42:36.080 --> 42:38.750
Now there are exactly
enough invitations

42:38.850 --> 42:40.390
for every kid in your class.

42:40.420 --> 42:43.360
So I want you to make sure
that everyone gets one, okay?

42:43.390 --> 42:44.760
They won't come.

42:44.860 --> 42:46.430
Of course they will.

42:46.530 --> 42:48.300
Everyone loves a party.

42:48.400 --> 42:51.030
- Can I invite the pretty lady?
- Who?

42:51.070 --> 42:52.630
The pretty lady from the pond.

42:52.730 --> 42:56.070
No.
No, you can't.

42:57.070 --> 42:59.540
Why not?
She's my best friend.

42:59.570 --> 43:01.540
She said that she
would take me home.

43:01.580 --> 43:04.110
Cody.

43:04.210 --> 43:06.210
This is your home.

43:06.250 --> 43:07.550
Okay?

43:07.580 --> 43:09.580
If you would just
talk to her, Mom.

43:09.620 --> 43:10.950
Cody, that's enough.

43:11.020 --> 43:13.250
Clean up your toys.
It's almost bedtime.

43:16.760 --> 43:20.090
♪ She'll be coming around
the mountain when she comes ♪

43:20.130 --> 43:23.230
♪ She'll be coming around
the mountain when she comes ♪

43:23.260 --> 43:26.800
♪ She'll be coming
around the mountain ♪

43:26.900 --> 43:28.500
♪ She'll be coming
around in the mountain ♪

43:28.600 --> 43:32.940
♪ She'll be coming around
the mountain when she comes ♪

43:33.010 --> 43:36.610
(electricity buzzing)

43:36.680 --> 43:39.250
Here she comes.

43:39.280 --> 43:43.950
(thud)

43:44.020 --> 43:45.490
Cody.

43:46.150 --> 43:47.620
Go upstairs,
hide in your closet.

43:47.650 --> 43:48.920
Do not make a sound.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.260
No, it's okay, Mom.
It's okay.

43:50.290 --> 43:52.290
- Listen to me. Don't be afraid!
- Cody, just go.

43:52.360 --> 43:55.000
(tense music)

44:12.310 --> 44:14.310
(electricity buzzing)

44:14.380 --> 44:17.020
(tense music)

44:17.920 --> 44:20.720
(eerie music)

44:52.690 --> 44:55.520
Cody, are you okay?

44:55.560 --> 44:57.860
(eerie music)

45:23.420 --> 45:25.950
(screeching)

45:43.470 --> 45:46.070
Mom. Mom.

45:47.540 --> 45:50.080
Mom, Mom.

45:51.480 --> 45:52.880
You fell down.

45:56.580 --> 45:58.550
Come on.
Come on.

46:02.290 --> 46:04.990
- Mom, what are you doing?
- Get in the car.

46:05.090 --> 46:07.160
- Why?
- Just get in.

46:07.260 --> 46:10.260
- But, Mom--
- Get in the car!

46:12.930 --> 46:14.770
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere but here.

46:14.840 --> 46:16.140
But why?
Because she scared you?

46:16.240 --> 46:17.570
She didn't mean
to scare you, Mom.

46:17.610 --> 46:18.640
Be quiet, Cody!

46:18.740 --> 46:20.070
You need to talk to her,
Mom.

46:20.110 --> 46:21.140
She would never hurt you.
She wouldn't hurt anyone!

46:21.240 --> 46:22.810
Enough, Cody!
Enough!

46:22.910 --> 46:24.280
I don't not know
what that thing is

46:24.310 --> 46:25.950
but you are never
talking to it again.

46:25.980 --> 46:27.280
Do you understand?
Ever!

46:27.310 --> 46:28.580
[Cody] Are you
gonna take me home?

46:28.620 --> 46:30.980
No, goddammit,
for the hundredth time.

46:31.080 --> 46:32.620
We're not going home.

46:32.690 --> 46:34.020
Stop talking about that.

46:34.120 --> 46:35.790
Then where are we going?

46:35.820 --> 46:38.460
(tense music)

46:40.090 --> 46:41.830
(engine struggling)

46:41.930 --> 46:43.460
What am I supposed to do?

46:43.500 --> 46:45.870
(sobbing)

46:48.200 --> 46:51.310
What am I supposed to do?

46:55.940 --> 46:57.550
It's okay, Mom.

46:58.450 --> 46:59.450
She's gone.

47:01.110 --> 47:03.320
I'll tell her not
to bother you anymore.

47:04.950 --> 47:06.150
Okay?

47:06.190 --> 47:08.190
You should go to bed.
You're tired.

47:09.060 --> 47:12.690
I'll stay with you, okay?

47:12.790 --> 47:15.230
We'll be all right.

47:15.330 --> 47:17.570
I promise.

47:17.670 --> 47:19.030
We're gonna be all right.

47:19.130 --> 47:22.000
(gentle music)

47:50.360 --> 47:52.270
You ready?

47:54.070 --> 47:56.370
Now, I want you
to give these out

47:56.400 --> 47:58.540
as soon as you get
to school, okay?

47:58.570 --> 47:59.940
- Okay.
- Okay.

48:00.040 --> 48:02.580
Put 'em right in here.

48:07.520 --> 48:10.220
(gentle music)

48:17.890 --> 48:19.390
Hello, operator,

48:19.460 --> 48:23.360
will you connect me with
St. Mary's church please?

48:24.130 --> 48:24.970
Thank you.

48:25.070 --> 48:26.070
[Woman] Saint Mary's.

48:26.100 --> 48:27.570
Sister Agnes speaking.

48:27.640 --> 48:28.800
Hi.

48:28.900 --> 48:31.570
I was wondering if there
might be someone available

48:31.640 --> 48:34.440
to speak with me?

48:34.540 --> 48:36.240
I, I think...

48:36.880 --> 48:41.580
I think I have a demon
or something in my house.

48:42.650 --> 48:44.590
(phone clicks)

48:44.620 --> 48:47.420
Hello?

48:47.460 --> 48:49.320
Hello?

48:52.090 --> 48:54.730
(eerie music)

49:09.740 --> 49:12.250
(soft music)

49:15.350 --> 49:16.780
Is Mr. Langtree available?

49:16.820 --> 49:19.820
[Mrs. Langtree] Why,
what'd you break this time?

49:19.920 --> 49:21.620
Oh.
Nothing, nothing.

49:21.690 --> 49:23.460
I just, um...

49:25.490 --> 49:27.530
I don't, I don't know
exactly how to say this.

49:27.630 --> 49:29.500
[Mrs. Langtree]
Well, just say it.

49:31.970 --> 49:33.300
Has anyone ever said

49:33.330 --> 49:37.470
that there's something
wrong with the house?

49:38.370 --> 49:40.780
[Mrs. Langtree]
What are you up to, missy?

49:41.810 --> 49:43.180
[Laura] What do you mean?

49:43.280 --> 49:44.980
Because you knew exactly
what you were getting into

49:45.010 --> 49:46.380
when you moved
into the house.

49:46.480 --> 49:48.820
So if you think that you
can come sashaying in here

49:48.880 --> 49:50.550
in that little skirt

49:50.650 --> 49:53.490
and con us into putting a whole
bunch of money into that place,

49:53.520 --> 49:55.660
my husband might be stupid
enough to fall for that,

49:55.690 --> 49:56.720
but I'm not.

49:56.820 --> 49:58.560
[Laura] I'm not
trying to do anything.

49:58.660 --> 50:00.230
Well, I don't know
what you're doing here

50:00.330 --> 50:02.330
in the first place, unless
you're hiding something.

50:02.360 --> 50:04.670
I am trying to ask you...

50:06.170 --> 50:09.040
if there's a ghost
in the house.

50:09.140 --> 50:10.810
A ghost!

50:10.840 --> 50:12.010
Is it drugs?

50:12.070 --> 50:13.970
No, no.

50:14.010 --> 50:15.680
I have a child.

50:15.740 --> 50:18.180
(soft music)

50:22.320 --> 50:24.250
Because if I get wind

50:24.350 --> 50:26.390
that any of that crap
is going on in that house,

50:26.490 --> 50:28.360
I'm going to call the police,

50:28.420 --> 50:30.530
and you can be sure
of the fact

50:30.560 --> 50:32.690
they'll take your
child away from you.

50:53.210 --> 50:55.250
I'm going to hang from here,

50:55.350 --> 50:57.850
and then along there.

50:57.890 --> 50:59.150
And maybe over there.

52:36.480 --> 52:38.820
You know, I bet some
of them even got lost.

52:38.850 --> 52:42.060
And people love to
come late to parties.

52:42.160 --> 52:43.220
You'll see.

52:45.890 --> 52:47.700
Maybe I should give
a few of them a call.

52:47.800 --> 52:50.330
I think I have a class list
from the school in the kitchen.

52:50.360 --> 52:51.730
Be right back.

52:53.030 --> 52:55.800
(gentle music)

53:18.730 --> 53:20.560
I don't think they're
coming, buddy.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.860
I know.

53:23.930 --> 53:27.030
I don't want you to
take it personally, okay?

53:27.070 --> 53:28.840
We live really far out of town.

53:28.870 --> 53:30.710
You know, some
people, they just,

53:30.770 --> 53:35.240
they can't spend the
time driving out here.

53:35.940 --> 53:37.880
Okay?

53:37.950 --> 53:40.210
But hey, next year
we'll have your party

53:40.250 --> 53:42.750
at the malt shop
or the pizza parlor.

53:42.850 --> 53:44.950
That'll be fun.

53:45.050 --> 53:46.890
Okay.

53:46.920 --> 53:50.420
Do you wanna
open your presents?

53:50.520 --> 53:51.930
Not right now.

53:52.030 --> 53:54.190
I think I'm just
going to go upstairs.

53:54.230 --> 53:55.860
You sure?

53:55.900 --> 53:57.900
Okay.

54:03.970 --> 54:07.310
(phone ringing)

54:11.650 --> 54:13.080
Stop calling here, Scott.

54:13.150 --> 54:15.080
[Scott] Please don't
hang up on me, Laura.

54:15.150 --> 54:17.890
Please talk to me.

54:18.920 --> 54:21.250
I've said everything I
ever want to say to you.

54:21.320 --> 54:23.790
[Scott] I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

54:23.890 --> 54:26.230
I miss you.
I miss my son.

54:26.260 --> 54:27.660
Well, you better
get used to it

54:27.760 --> 54:30.000
because you'll never see
either one of us ever again.

54:30.100 --> 54:32.930
(tense music)

54:42.610 --> 54:45.480
(gentle music)

55:09.470 --> 55:12.640
And I love the way our
Hotpoint's designed too.

55:12.710 --> 55:14.540
It could have been made for me.

55:15.480 --> 55:18.780
The interior arrangements
are all so practical.

56:09.560 --> 56:12.170
(eerie music)

56:22.110 --> 56:23.840
Cody!

56:23.880 --> 56:24.780
Why?

56:24.880 --> 56:26.350
Why didn't
you hand these out?

56:26.380 --> 56:27.880
I spent all that time

56:27.920 --> 56:30.420
making a special day
for your birthday

56:30.520 --> 56:32.190
and you just sat there.

56:32.220 --> 56:34.860
You just sat there
and watched me do it.

56:34.890 --> 56:37.220
And you didn't even hand
out the invitations!

56:37.290 --> 56:38.560
Why?

56:38.590 --> 56:39.530
Why would you do that?

56:39.560 --> 56:41.060
Cody.

56:41.130 --> 56:42.460
Cody, no.

56:42.560 --> 56:44.230
Cody, come back here.

56:47.030 --> 56:48.040
Cody,

56:48.070 --> 56:49.700
Cody,

56:49.740 --> 56:51.110
Cody, stop it right now.

56:51.210 --> 56:53.410
- Now, tell me!
- Because they wouldn't come.

56:53.470 --> 56:55.480
You don't listen to me.
You don't listen to anyone!

56:55.580 --> 56:56.740
How would you know that?

56:56.810 --> 56:57.750
You didn't even
give them a chance.

56:57.780 --> 56:58.580
Because I'm not like them.

56:58.610 --> 56:59.550
I hate it here.

56:59.580 --> 57:01.050
I want to go home.

57:01.080 --> 57:03.080
We are not going back there.
Do you hear me?

57:03.150 --> 57:05.950
(eerie music)

57:06.050 --> 57:08.620
Cody.

57:11.930 --> 57:13.090
Cody, what--

57:13.130 --> 57:14.460
what is wrong with you?

57:14.560 --> 57:15.500
Cody, Cody,

57:15.600 --> 57:16.500
please.

57:16.600 --> 57:17.930
I'm so sorry.

57:17.970 --> 57:19.500
Okay.

57:19.600 --> 57:22.000
Breathe with Mommy.
Breathe, baby.

57:41.960 --> 57:43.660
If you start to feel bad again,

57:43.760 --> 57:45.830
you just tell the teacher, okay?

57:45.930 --> 57:47.660
Okay.

58:05.650 --> 58:07.110
[Boss] Laura.

58:09.620 --> 58:11.020
Laura.

58:14.190 --> 58:15.990
Laura!

58:16.020 --> 58:18.830
I need that new DM 40
on my desk in an hour.

58:21.000 --> 58:24.330
The DM4's the most
crucial form in the file.

58:24.400 --> 58:26.670
Hey, Cody, how was your day?

58:26.730 --> 58:29.340
- It was okay.
- Yeah?

58:33.510 --> 58:37.140
Cody, have you been
teasing those little girls?

58:39.380 --> 58:40.480
No.

58:40.510 --> 58:41.920
Are you sure?

58:42.020 --> 58:43.350
Yes.

58:43.380 --> 58:46.320
'Cause I can see them
tattling on you to a teacher.

58:49.190 --> 58:50.690
Do you want to give me
your side of the story

58:50.720 --> 58:52.360
before I get a call tonight?

58:52.390 --> 58:54.190
I didn't do anything.

58:54.830 --> 58:56.860
All right,
I'll wait for the call.

58:59.270 --> 59:01.940
(gentle music)

59:19.250 --> 59:22.060
(wood creaking)

59:36.540 --> 59:38.210
Mrs. Langtree?

59:39.470 --> 59:41.640
Oh, oh, hello.

59:41.740 --> 59:44.550
I was just checking
on the appliances.

59:44.580 --> 59:46.310
- Really?
- [Mrs. Langtree] Yeah.

59:46.410 --> 59:49.080
I don't think so.
I think you were snooping.

59:49.120 --> 59:51.650
Did you find the drugs
you were looking for?

59:51.750 --> 59:53.120
You know, this is my house

59:53.190 --> 59:54.790
so I can actually check
on it anytime I want.

59:54.890 --> 59:56.120
Not without my
permission, you can't.

59:56.220 --> 59:57.890
And if you'd like
to validate that,

59:57.930 --> 59:59.560
we can call the police.

59:59.590 --> 01:00:01.160
The police?

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:02.930
Mm-hmm.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.400
Is there something
wrong with you?

01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:09.440
Because I think there's
something terribly wrong

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:10.840
going on in this house.

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:11.910
Well, when you figure it out,

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:13.570
will you give me a holler?

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:15.840
Because I would
just love to know.

01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:19.450
I want you out of this house.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.620
You have 30 days.

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.280
Put it in writing.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.520
Oh, I will.

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:26.490

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:48.560
Please breathe.

01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:49.890
Breathe, baby.

01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:52.690
There. That's right, baby.
That's right.

01:03:52.790 --> 01:03:53.990
You're okay.

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:57.000
Oh, Cody. Cody.

01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:59.830
(breathing heavily)

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:02.640
- (gentle music)
- Cody.

01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:39.440
[Boss] I've had
repeated complaints

01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:42.540
about the DM 40 being filed
incorrectly or incomplete,

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:44.580
not attaching your
correspondence

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:45.880
to the proper files.

01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:47.950
I'll try to get
better at that.

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:51.050
It's extremely important
that you maintain

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:53.990
proper maintenance of the
files for the auditors.

01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:55.890
We're graded on accuracy.

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.960
There're fines implemented

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:00.430
if we don't meet
a certain standard.

01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:03.600
I understand.

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:06.570
Laura, I have to ask you
a personal question.

01:05:07.930 --> 01:05:09.540
Have you been drinking?

01:05:09.570 --> 01:05:10.740
(scoffs)

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:14.480
I know you have.
I can smell it.

01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:16.580
We don't tolerate
drinking on the job.

01:05:16.610 --> 01:05:18.950
That's clearly stated
in your employee handbook.

01:05:19.050 --> 01:05:20.580
Yes, it is.

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:22.450
I know because I read it.

01:05:25.550 --> 01:05:28.120
But I think that if you had
my job, you'd be drinking too.

01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:31.090
You try leaving your
family and your friends

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:32.590
and everything you've ever known

01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:35.500
to move to this small town
in the middle of nowhere,

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:36.760
all by yourself,

01:05:36.830 --> 01:05:40.100
simply because no one
gave you any other choice.

01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:42.100
Then talk to me about
drinking on the job.

01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:43.140
Laura, look.

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:44.570
Or maybe there's
a company manual

01:05:44.610 --> 01:05:47.610
on how to get rid
of a monster.

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:50.280
And I'm not talking
about my ex-husband

01:05:50.310 --> 01:05:54.680
or my entire
overwhelming situation.

01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:58.790
No, I am talking about
an actual monster

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:00.320
who comes into my house

01:06:00.350 --> 01:06:01.760
in the middle of the night

01:06:01.790 --> 01:06:03.160
and tries to drag my son out

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:05.490
and drown him in
a pond out back.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.470
I know you think I'm nuts.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:12.000
No.

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:13.130
I don't think that.

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.840
I think you need help.

01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:16.170
I do not need help.

01:06:16.270 --> 01:06:18.540
I have everything
completely under control.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.270
No, you don't.

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:23.310
There's no reason we
can't help women like you.

01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:24.550
There's a number there.

01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:28.620
Call it, speak to
a nurse or counselor.

01:06:28.650 --> 01:06:34.090
Actually, I think
you should keep this

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:35.290
because I don't
want your help

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.660
and I don't want
your miserable job.

01:06:37.730 --> 01:06:39.130
Then go.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.630
I'm gone, daddy-o.

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:23.870
Ginger Rogers.

01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:26.870
Your beer is empty.

01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:28.210
I'm going to buy you another.

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:29.710
Bartender, can he have another?

01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:31.710
And can I have
another one of those?

01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:32.510
No, no, no, please.

01:07:32.550 --> 01:07:34.010
You, you don't buy me a drink.

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:35.550
Come on, I'm celebrating.

01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:37.050
Oh, what are we celebrating?

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:38.890
I quit my job today.

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.720
I hated it so I quit it.

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:42.260
Atta girl.

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:43.690
I like your style.

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:47.090
I'll tell you what,
I'll get you that drink

01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:50.030
if you come dance with me.

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:51.730
Oh.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:52.730
Come on.

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:54.570
One dance.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.370
(gentle music)

01:07:59.410 --> 01:08:00.780
You know this song?

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.080
Mm-mm.

01:08:02.110 --> 01:08:05.150
Yeah, well,
it's old and forgotten.

01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:07.720
Kinda like me.

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.150
But, you,

01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:12.720
you are a pretty young thing

01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:16.460
in a pretty little
polka dot dress.

01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:20.899
You look like an angel.

01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:24.600
I mean like...

01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:27.770
like I died and went to heaven.

01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:31.770
I was an angel once

01:08:31.810 --> 01:08:34.310
in a play at church.

01:08:35.479 --> 01:08:39.450
My grandmother made me the
most beautiful angel wings.

01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:42.649
I felt like I could
fly in those wings.

01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:43.920
A girl like you,

01:08:43.950 --> 01:08:46.620
you don't need wings to fly.

01:08:46.649 --> 01:08:48.290
No, I have a car.

01:08:48.359 --> 01:08:50.790
Oh, well, that'll do.

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:51.859
That's pretty good.

01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:54.859
So what are you going
to do next, angel?

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:57.500
(soft music)

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:01.670
I don't know.

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:02.870
I don't know.

01:09:04.770 --> 01:09:05.540
Hey, hey, hey.

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:06.210
Don't cry.

01:09:06.310 --> 01:09:07.510
Don't cry.

01:09:07.609 --> 01:09:08.810
You're going to
figure something out.

01:09:11.310 --> 01:09:13.810
I just wish I could
go somewhere else,

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:15.880
you know, somewhere new

01:09:15.979 --> 01:09:17.350
and start fresh.

01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:19.390
Just, just start over.

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:22.990
Then you go,

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:27.160
you dig out those pretty
little wings of yours

01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:30.830
and you fly, fly, fly.

01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:33.399
(soft music)

01:09:51.490 --> 01:09:54.250
(tense music)

01:10:01.190 --> 01:10:02.400
Cody.

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:04.900
Do you know Cody Butler?

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.030
Have you seen Cody Butler?

01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:07.070
No.

01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:08.770
(tense music)

01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:10.240
Cody?

01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:14.170
Do you know Cody Butler?

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:17.040
Hey, do you know Cody Butler?

01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:19.550
Cody?

01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:22.620
Hey, hey, do you
know Cody Butler?

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:24.380
No?

01:10:24.450 --> 01:10:27.250
(tense music)

01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:30.220
Have you seen Cody Butler?

01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:32.290
(eerie music)

01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:36.460
(child screams)

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:37.630
[Officer] How are
you today, ma'am?

01:10:37.730 --> 01:10:40.430
Officer, I came
to pick up my son

01:10:40.530 --> 01:10:41.940
and I can't find him anywhere.

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.570
Okay, okay.
It's all right, ma'am.

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:44.910
What's your son's name?

01:10:44.970 --> 01:10:46.240
His name is Cody Butler.

01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:48.540
He's a second grade student.

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:50.410
I'm afraid that my ex-husband

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.580
has taken him
without my knowledge.

01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:53.880
[Officer] Okay, well,
we're going to get

01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:55.780
- to the bottom of this, okay?
- Okay.

01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:57.380
[Officer] Do you, do you
have any identification?

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.720
For Cody?

01:10:58.750 --> 01:11:00.290
[Officer] No, ma'am,
your identification.

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:02.920
(soft music)

01:11:06.090 --> 01:11:07.260
Hi, Laura.

01:11:07.290 --> 01:11:08.630
I'm Barb Schiff.

01:11:08.730 --> 01:11:10.500
I'm a caseworker
with the department.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.430
I'm sorry it took me
so long to get here.

01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.940
How are you?

01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:16.440
Where is Cody?

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:18.510
I went to school to pick
him up and he was not there.

01:11:18.610 --> 01:11:20.070
No, he wasn't.

01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:23.310
Where do you think he is?

01:11:23.410 --> 01:11:24.510
Does his dad have him?

01:11:24.610 --> 01:11:26.780
[Barb] No, he doesn't.

01:11:26.810 --> 01:11:28.280
How do you know?

01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:29.850
Did you call him?

01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:32.250
I didn't need to.

01:11:32.290 --> 01:11:35.120
What do you mean?

01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:37.630
Laura,

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:40.700
would you mind if we
backed up a little bit?

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.800
I think I could be of more help

01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:46.170
if I understood the
details of Cody's accident.

01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:50.870
I'm referring to the accident
last year in Arizona.

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:54.480
Oh.

01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:57.040
Well, that was nothing.

01:11:57.140 --> 01:11:59.050
He fell in the pool.

01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:04.350
I wasn't there.

01:12:04.450 --> 01:12:07.590
I had to go to
the grocery store.

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:10.730
His father was watching him.

01:12:13.890 --> 01:12:16.830
When I came home, Scott was on
the couch, watching the game

01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:18.670
and I went into the kitchen

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:23.070
and I had this weird feeling
like something wrong.

01:12:23.170 --> 01:12:24.510
And I was standing at the sink

01:12:24.570 --> 01:12:26.240
and I was looking out
the window at the pool

01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:28.410
and I thought I saw
something in it.

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:32.850
When I went out to check,
I saw that it was him.

01:12:33.650 --> 01:12:37.590
And then what happened?

01:12:38.690 --> 01:12:41.090
Well, I dragged him out

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:42.390
and I performed CPR on him

01:12:42.490 --> 01:12:44.190
until the paramedics came

01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:48.860
and then they revived him
and he was completely okay.

01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:53.430
Why?

01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:56.600
Are you saying there's
something wrong with him

01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:58.340
because of what happened?

01:12:58.370 --> 01:13:00.270
No, that is not
what I'm saying.

01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:03.440
(phone vibrating)

01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:20.630
It's okay, Laura.

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:22.700
You're all right.

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:26.470
(eerie music)

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:34.240
I think I need some water.

01:13:35.810 --> 01:13:37.110
Okay.

01:13:37.210 --> 01:13:38.150
You sit tight.

01:13:38.250 --> 01:13:39.550
I'll get you one.

01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:42.250
(eerie music)

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:52.630

01:17:03.450 --> 01:17:04.950
Where have you been?

01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:06.690
Honey, why didn't
you wait for me

01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:08.190
to pick you up from school?

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:11.190
[Cody] It's time
for me to go home, Mom.

01:17:11.290 --> 01:17:12.790
No, no, no.

01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:14.930
I'm going to take you
somewhere else, okay?

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.100
I'm going to take
you away from here.

01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:17.800
That's what you want, right?

01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:19.700
We're going to pack up
the car

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:21.470
and we're going to go
somewhere brand new

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:24.000
and we're going to have
a fresh start, okay?

01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:25.610
Okay?

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:28.540
[Cody] I don't want to.

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:31.850
Well, you have to.
Mommy says.

01:17:31.950 --> 01:17:36.350
So go upstairs
and pack up your stuff.

01:17:36.450 --> 01:17:38.990

Cody, please don't leave me.

(sobbing)

01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:01.630

It was an accident.

01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:03.930
It's okay.

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:05.030
It's not okay.

01:20:05.130 --> 01:20:07.440
It will be, you'll see.

want you to leave me.
