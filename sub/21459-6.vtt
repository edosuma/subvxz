And she couldn't
find her phone.

07:27.613 --> 07:29.365
{\an1}So Chase was like,
it's probably upstairs

07:29.448 --> 07:31.409
{\an1}in Alex's room, like,
let's go upstairs,

07:31.492 --> 07:33.995
{\an1}and they banged on
Alex's door.

07:34.078 --> 07:35.705
{\an1}Alex answered the door
butt-naked

07:35.788 --> 07:37.999
{\an1}and Amanda said
she peeked in

07:38.082 --> 07:40.209
{\an1}and saw Kelsey laying
in the bed naked.

07:40.293 --> 07:45.548
{\an6}(exhales)

07:40.293 --> 07:45.548
And Chase confirmed it, too.

07:45.631 --> 07:46.716
{\an8}And Amanda would not lie...

07:46.799 --> 07:49.594
{\an7}But Kelsey and Garrett
were still together

07:49.677 --> 07:52.013
during that gala.

07:52.096 --> 07:54.891
{\an5}So she's sketchy.

07:52.096 --> 07:54.891
Does she think we're stupid?

07:54.974 --> 07:57.101
She thinks that
we don't know Alex.

07:57.185 --> 07:59.896
Like, she wants to be
like all Miss Perfect.

07:59.979 --> 08:04.066
Pathetic. Stop pretending
you're so innocent.

08:04.150 --> 08:07.069
{\an4}We'll let her pretend.
I don't trust her.

08:04.150 --> 08:07.069
{\an3}Yeah.

{\an1}If she's gonna cheat
on Garrett

08:08.654 --> 08:10.907
{\an1}when (bleep) Alex, like,
oh, what do you think?

08:10.990 --> 08:13.409
{\an1}You're special?
'Cause you're not.

08:13.492 --> 08:15.912
That's the thing.
The new girl doesn't know.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.706

an Oompa Loompa.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.571

{\an1}I'm a girl,
I know how girls act.

15:17.374 --> 15:20.461
She acts like she doesn't like
Alex and that's a big fat lie.

15:20.544 --> 15:25.174
Do you think that he has
feelings for her?

15:25.257 --> 15:27.176
No, not deep.

{\an3}Yeah.

15:29.470 --> 15:30.721
You think he does?

15:30.804 --> 15:35.100
I think that he wants
what he can't have.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.019
And now he's got Garrett
out of the situation.

15:37.102 --> 15:40.856
{\an1}I don't like that
she did that to Garrett.

15:40.939 --> 15:43.025
{\an1}I think he's a really
sweet kid.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.610
{\an1}Garrett didn't
do anything wrong.

15:44.693 --> 15:46.195
Just 'cause she fell
out of love with him

15:46.278 --> 15:47.738
doesn't make it his fault.

15:47.821 --> 15:50.449
{\an8}So she fell out of love
with him because of Alex?

15:50.532 --> 15:53.369
{\an1}Kelsey's not even really
Alex's type, is she?

{\an4}Yeah.

Hello, how are you?

19:08.564 --> 19:10.232
{\an8}Hi.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.232
{\an8}How are you?

19:10.315 --> 19:11.358
{\an9}All right.

19:11.441 --> 19:12.693
{\an8}All right.

19:12.776 --> 19:15.404
{\an1}Yeah, so, like,
on the boat the other day,

19:15.487 --> 19:18.073
{\an1}you and Alex seemed like
you were, like, flirting a lot.

19:18.156 --> 19:19.992
{\an1}I mean, he taught you
how to wakeboard.

19:20.075 --> 19:22.536
{\an6}Yeah.

19:20.075 --> 19:22.536
What do you think?

19:22.619 --> 19:24.121
{\an3}I mean...

19:24.204 --> 19:26.248
I think, like, obviously...

19:26.331 --> 19:28.709
We have, like, a, like,
fun chemistry together,

19:28.792 --> 19:30.252
but that's all it's ever
gonna be, like...

19:30.335 --> 19:31.962
{\an4}Yeah.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.962
That's absolutely it.

19:32.045 --> 19:35.007
{\an1}So, honestly, on this trip,
I kinda thought

19:35.090 --> 19:36.508
{\an1}you and Alex
would be, like...

19:36.592 --> 19:38.844
I feel like that's
what everyone thought.

19:38.927 --> 19:40.637
I think that might be
the reason...

19:40.721 --> 19:42.598
And, I'm, like,
don't take this wrong.

19:42.681 --> 19:45.100
But I feel, like, that might
be why Juliette looks at me

19:45.183 --> 19:47.185
kind of as a threat
when it comes to Alex.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.646
A hundred percent.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.398
I don't, like, I don't care.

19:51.481 --> 19:55.360
{\an1}I heard, like, after the gala,
I heard you and Alex were,

19:55.444 --> 20:00.324
{\an1}like, all over each other
in the hot tub and everything.

20:00.407 --> 20:02.284
Me and Alex are nothing.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.494
And that's all
that's gonna happen.

20:06.204 --> 20:09.166
{\an1}Amanda said
you were in his bed.

20:09.249 --> 20:10.709
{\an3}No.

20:10.792 --> 20:12.878
{\an5}That didn't happen?

20:10.792 --> 20:12.878
{\an3}No.

20:12.961 --> 20:14.671
So Amanda's making that up?

20:16.548 --> 20:18.675
Just one-on-one,
like, me and you,

20:18.759 --> 20:20.302
like, I will have your back

you tell me the truth.

20:22.596 --> 20:24.222

20:22.596 --> 20:24.222

20:24.306 --> 20:26.725

like, with Alex
or any guy in this house,

20:30.979 --> 20:32.522

talk to me again.

she's the type of girl

33:18.830 --> 33:20.206

jealous, which obviously

33:20.289 --> 33:22.041

you picked up on that

33:23.668 --> 33:25.461

33:42.270 --> 33:44.021
{\an1}And then when he's, like,
worried about me coming here

33:44.105 --> 33:46.733
with a group of guys
he doesn't know well

33:46.816 --> 33:47.942

he likes her like that.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.014

34:19.098 --> 34:20.600
Yeah, I absolutely agree.

and she likes him.

34:26.188 --> 34:27.315

around each other.

34:27.398 --> 34:28.565

34:28.649 --> 34:29.984
{\an1}He asked her!
She didn't ask him.

34:30.067 --> 34:31.485

trying to get laid.

have friend, girlfriends?

34:42.663 --> 34:43.371

34:43.456 --> 34:46.751
Yeah, but you used
to date him.

Guys, I think that Alex and
Kelsey can just be friends.

34:50.087 --> 34:52.047

that's what they are.

34:52.130 --> 34:55.259

on a dinner alone, bam, I win.

and didn't invite them.
