00:23.197 --> 00:25.373
What the hell,
Bianca? You trashed my room.

00:25.460 --> 00:26.417
You lied to me.

00:26.504 --> 00:27.940
What are
you talking about?

00:28.071 --> 00:28.985
You promised me
we'd go away next weekend,

00:29.116 --> 00:30.595
and now you're going with Chad?

00:30.682 --> 00:32.467
- He's my boyfriend, Bianca.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.556
You know what?
I'm out of here.

00:34.643 --> 00:38.038
You're a complete
psycho. Get outta my way.

00:41.563 --> 00:43.521
- Sophie, I'm sorry.
Please don't go.

00:43.608 --> 00:46.133
I, I, I'll, I'll replace
the stuff in your room

00:46.263 --> 00:47.743
and it's fine if you wanna
go away with Chad and,

00:47.830 --> 00:49.788
and we can, we can go
away some other time.

00:49.875 --> 00:52.617
- I am never, ever going
anywhere with you ever again.

00:52.748 --> 00:55.229
- Please, I'm sorry. I
just get upset sometimes-

00:55.359 --> 00:57.796
- Stop! Stop using your
dead sister as an excuse.

00:57.927 --> 01:00.234
It's old and tired, and frankly,

01:00.364 --> 01:03.454
if I had you as a sister,
I'd slit my wrist, too.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.982
It's beyond me how you even
function in the real world,

01:10.113 --> 01:12.115
let alone run a company.

01:12.202 --> 01:13.856
You should be locked
up and in the-

01:23.561 --> 01:26.347
I told you. Don't
ever talk about my sister.

01:47.019 --> 01:48.064
What are
you doing with that?

01:48.151 --> 01:49.674
I'm
taking it with me.

01:49.805 --> 01:50.893
Couples fight.

01:50.979 --> 01:52.808
Why are you turning this
into such a big deal?

01:52.938 --> 01:54.984
It's
all we do anymore.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.854
- All right, Angelina, you
already made your point.

01:56.942 --> 01:57.639
Let's just cut the drama.

01:57.769 --> 01:59.728
- This isn't a joke. I'm done.

01:59.858 --> 02:01.730
I can't keep doing this.
I can't keep living here.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.471
- You can't be serious.

02:04.776 --> 02:05.299
- I am.

02:06.648 --> 02:08.606
- Where are you gonna go? Hm.

02:08.737 --> 02:09.999
- That's none of your business.

02:10.086 --> 02:11.696
- Shut up, Gaby!

02:11.827 --> 02:13.002
You're gonna let your
friends run your life?

02:13.089 --> 02:14.221
Is that really

02:14.308 --> 02:15.396
what you want-
- if she let me run her life,

02:15.526 --> 02:16.788
then she would've left
you a long time ago.

02:16.919 --> 02:18.007
Leave her alone.

02:19.443 --> 02:20.357
- Don't tell me what to do.
- All right, all right.

02:20.488 --> 02:22.316
You can't
stop her from leaving.

02:23.839 --> 02:24.840
- Who the hell's this?

02:24.970 --> 02:26.972
- I'm just here
for their safety.

02:27.103 --> 02:28.583
- You hired some
meathead to come in here

02:28.670 --> 02:31.107
to protect you from
your own boyfriend, huh?

02:31.238 --> 02:32.152
Are you sleeping
with this loser?

02:32.239 --> 02:34.023
- Step back, man.

02:34.110 --> 02:36.504
- You think I'm gonna let
you come into my house

02:36.634 --> 02:39.159
and tell me how to
handle my business, huh?

02:39.246 --> 02:40.508
- Mm.
- Get out!

02:43.511 --> 02:45.295
- Let me make this clear.

02:45.426 --> 02:46.775
You're gonna let
Angelina and Gaby finish

02:46.905 --> 02:48.472
what they're doing and
then you're never going

02:48.559 --> 02:51.345
to contact Angelina
again, you understand?

02:59.656 --> 03:01.355
- Baby, come on.

03:01.485 --> 03:02.747
- Just stop!

03:02.834 --> 03:07.274
- I, it's you and me. It's
always been you and me.

03:08.275 --> 03:08.623
- Is that last one ready, Ange?

03:08.710 --> 03:13.715
- Hey!

03:15.456 --> 03:18.372
I meant it when I said you
were my angel, Angelina.

03:20.852 --> 03:23.203
Hey, let's go.
Hey, no, come here.

03:30.340 --> 03:31.863
- She deserves way
better than you.

03:31.994 --> 03:34.562
- She's mine, bro. Not yours.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.478
Don't think you could touch her.

03:38.609 --> 03:41.569
Okay?

03:48.531 --> 03:49.228
Bye.

03:54.016 --> 03:55.539
Hey.

03:55.670 --> 03:58.454
- Thanks for all your help,
and you know, for being 6'3".

03:58.542 --> 04:00.414
Not a problem.

04:00.544 --> 04:01.937
Hey, Gaby, is she gonna be okay?

04:05.332 --> 04:08.117
- Yeah. I'll make sure of it.

04:08.204 --> 04:12.904
- Good. Well, I will
see you Monday at work.

04:14.558 --> 04:15.690
You girls needed anything
at all, please call me.

04:15.820 --> 04:16.560
- Thanks.
- Okay.

04:29.965 --> 04:30.922
- It's done.

04:33.229 --> 04:34.143
- It's done.

04:37.712 --> 04:40.758
It's gonna be hard for a while.

04:40.845 --> 04:43.413
- I just, I don't
wanna be weak again.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.459
Won't go back like
I did last time.

04:45.546 --> 04:47.330
- You're not weak.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.680
He's gonna try to convince
you that you need him,

04:49.767 --> 04:51.073
but you don't.

04:51.203 --> 04:53.118
Don't even respond to his text.

04:54.946 --> 04:58.298
- Thank you for always
being there when I need you.

04:59.690 --> 05:00.822
- It's a two-way street.

05:00.909 --> 05:02.824
Remember in high school
when you let me copy

05:02.954 --> 05:05.957
your calculus homework
for an entire semester?

05:06.044 --> 05:08.177
You saved me from having
to take summer school.

05:11.136 --> 05:12.703
All right, it's
been a rough day.

05:12.834 --> 05:16.316
Why don't you go take a
bath and order a pizza.

05:17.665 --> 05:18.970
Extra pepperoni, right?

05:20.363 --> 05:22.713
Oh, that's right.
You hate pepperoni.

07:31.668 --> 07:32.495
What was that?

07:32.582 --> 07:33.278
- I think it's him.

07:34.584 --> 07:35.890
- Better not be.

07:41.808 --> 07:43.463
There's no one there.

08:01.350 --> 08:02.307
- He's insane.

08:45.133 --> 08:48.223
- Out with the old and in
with the new, right, Delilah?

08:48.353 --> 08:51.052
Okay. Go.

09:35.705 --> 09:37.402
- You should take
my bed tonight.

09:37.533 --> 09:39.448
You need a good night's sleep.

09:39.535 --> 09:41.972
- I feel terrible about
dragging into this.

09:42.103 --> 09:44.714
What if that brick came
through the window?

09:44.845 --> 09:47.412
- Then we would've
filed a police report

09:47.543 --> 09:50.894
and there'd be someone here
replacing the window right now.

09:51.025 --> 09:52.417
- Okay, don't make light of it.

09:52.504 --> 09:54.071
This isn't fair to you.

09:54.202 --> 09:56.117
- You always have a place here.

09:56.247 --> 09:57.118
- I should get going.

09:58.510 --> 09:59.555
- See you tonight?

09:59.642 --> 10:00.469
- Yep.

10:07.824 --> 10:11.785
Do you ever think
about hurting yourself?

10:11.872 --> 10:14.483
- I just don't think that
anyone would miss me.

10:14.614 --> 10:18.139
- I would miss you.
Dylan, look at me.

10:19.836 --> 10:22.447
I would miss you and I
don't want you to die.

10:23.535 --> 10:25.973
Things change. Feelings change.

10:26.103 --> 10:26.930
The way you feel
today won't be the way

10:27.061 --> 10:29.498
you feel next week
or next month,

10:31.195 --> 10:33.633
so when you get those thoughts
about hurting yourself,

10:33.763 --> 10:36.331
you have to remember
that those thoughts

10:36.461 --> 10:38.507
and that situation,
it's only temporary.

10:43.730 --> 10:48.256
I know it's hard to see it
when you're in that dark place,

10:48.386 --> 10:50.650
but you have to trust that
things will get better.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.177
- That's actually
really good advice.

10:57.047 --> 10:58.440
Thanks.

10:58.570 --> 11:01.661
I'm gonna write it down in my
phone so I don't forget it.

11:13.716 --> 11:14.978
- Hey, Gaby.

11:15.805 --> 11:17.198
Hey.

11:17.328 --> 11:18.634
- Get out of here before
I call the police, Marco.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.767
- I just came to
apologize, okay?

11:20.854 --> 11:22.420
Yesterday caught
me off guard and I,

11:22.551 --> 11:25.815
I didn't react the way
I normally would have.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.295
I found an anger
management center

11:27.382 --> 11:29.601
and I'm gonna start
taking classes.

11:29.732 --> 11:31.473
If you think
I'm gonna convince her

11:31.603 --> 11:33.780
to take you back, you're crazy.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.782
Angelina's done. Move on.

11:35.912 --> 11:37.522
Stop throwing bricks at my door.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.133
- No one understands what Ange

11:39.263 --> 11:42.353
and I have been through, okay?

11:44.051 --> 11:45.182
Not even you.

11:45.313 --> 11:46.618
- Let me make this
crystal clear.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.578
You show up here again, I'll
file a restraining order.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.929
- Watch the way you
talk to me, hear me?

11:53.060 --> 11:55.366
You're not as untouchable
as you think you are.

11:55.453 --> 11:57.194
Neither is she.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.147
- Los Angeles native,

13:20.234 --> 13:24.804
graduated from L.A. Palms
University, allergic to cats,

13:27.894 --> 13:29.939
and works as a suicide
prevention counselor

13:30.070 --> 13:32.463
for disadvantaged youth, hmm.

13:53.093 --> 13:56.139
Best city Seattle, hmm.

14:15.071 --> 14:16.812
- Hello?

14:16.899 --> 14:20.207
- Hi, uh, Angelina? This
is Bianca Hernandez.

14:20.337 --> 14:22.949
You emailed me about
the room I posted.

14:23.036 --> 14:26.691
- Oh yeah, hi. Thank you for
calling me back so quickly.

14:26.822 --> 14:28.780
- Well, it's been
empty for a while now

14:28.911 --> 14:30.043
and I'd like to get it rented.

14:30.173 --> 14:31.522
Do you wanna come in and see it?

14:31.609 --> 14:35.787
- Sure, um, I get off at
4:30. Does that work for you?

14:35.918 --> 14:38.007
- That's perfect. I'll
text you the address.

14:38.094 --> 14:40.662
- Thanks. Uh, I'll see
you this afternoon.

14:40.749 --> 14:41.532
- Bye.

15:15.044 --> 15:16.611
You don't live here
anymore, Delilah.

16:29.162 --> 16:31.207
Hello. Angelina, right?

16:31.294 --> 16:33.035
- Yes. Hi, nice to meet you.

16:33.165 --> 16:33.862
- Come on in.

16:39.694 --> 16:41.652
- Wow. This is beautiful.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.045
- Thank you.

16:43.132 --> 16:45.352
I have to admit it's not
always quite this neat.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.268
- No, I mean you
have great style.

16:48.398 --> 16:49.878
I love the artwork.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.271
- Thanks.

16:51.401 --> 16:53.186
My old roommate actually
bought a lot of these pieces,

16:53.273 --> 16:55.971
but I don't think she's
coming back for them

16:56.058 --> 16:58.365
or any of her stuff,
it looks like.

16:58.495 --> 16:59.496
- Really?

16:59.583 --> 17:02.021
- Yeah. It's a
long, boring story.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.982
- Oh my gosh, I love Seattle.

17:07.113 --> 17:09.202
I was actually up there
like a few months ago.

17:09.332 --> 17:11.377
- It's my favorite
city. I go all the time.

17:14.468 --> 17:15.208
Do you wanna see the pool?

17:15.295 --> 17:16.252
- Yeah.

17:22.258 --> 17:25.218
- I know it's not much,
but you get used to it.

17:25.305 --> 17:27.915
- Yeah, I bet I can
probably adjust somehow.

17:28.002 --> 17:30.179
Let
me show your room.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.230
It's obviously
already pretty filled,

17:37.360 --> 17:39.580
but we can take out anything
you don't wanna keep.

17:39.667 --> 17:42.148
- No, no, this is amazing.

17:42.278 --> 17:44.019
I can't believe someone
would just leave this place

17:44.150 --> 17:45.586
and all these beautiful things.

17:46.891 --> 17:47.936
- I know.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.461
She was sweet, but
she had her problems

17:51.548 --> 17:53.246
and she caused me
a lot of grief.

17:55.030 --> 17:58.555
I hope she's happy, though.
Come check out the rooftop.

18:05.736 --> 18:07.564
And this is where I do yoga

18:07.651 --> 18:09.958
and, I don't know,
just clear my mind.

18:10.089 --> 18:10.959
- It's great.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.049
- Come on.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.704
Then I left San Francisco, wow,

18:16.791 --> 18:18.749
five years ago
before I landed here.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.708
- You still have
family up there?

18:20.795 --> 18:22.188
- Not anymore.

18:22.275 --> 18:24.494
Our grandmother raised us,
but she passed a while back.

18:24.581 --> 18:25.626
- Us?

18:25.713 --> 18:26.801
- Me and my little sister.

18:26.931 --> 18:28.629
- Oh my gosh, you're so lucky.

18:28.716 --> 18:32.328
I'm an only child. I always
wanted a brother or sister.

18:32.415 --> 18:33.416
- It's a bond like no other.

18:33.503 --> 18:35.070
- Yeah, especially
when your parents

18:35.157 --> 18:37.116
are constantly moving
around like mine did.

18:38.421 --> 18:40.423
Oh my gosh. Are these yours?

18:40.554 --> 18:41.816
Uh,
just some concepts

18:41.946 --> 18:43.513
I'm flushing out for a new line.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.906
- You're a designer.

18:44.993 --> 18:45.994
- Nothing crazy.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.257
I'm contracted with
a few small retailers

18:48.388 --> 18:50.433
and mostly sell to boutiques.

18:52.740 --> 18:56.309
Your email said you are a
suicide prevention counselor.

18:56.439 --> 18:59.225
- Yeah. I work at the
youth center in Lennox.

18:59.355 --> 19:00.835
- That must be really rewarding.

19:00.965 --> 19:03.620
- It is. It's also kind of hard.

19:03.707 --> 19:05.144
I don't only work
with suicidal kids,

19:05.274 --> 19:07.929
but also all kinds of traumas.

19:08.059 --> 19:09.322
- Like the death of a parent.

19:09.452 --> 19:12.586
- Yeah, actually I just
started working with this girl

19:12.716 --> 19:15.371
and she witnessed her
father kill her mother.

19:15.458 --> 19:18.679
- Really? Why'd he kill her?

19:21.116 --> 19:22.073
What'd she do?

19:22.204 --> 19:23.597
- The mother? Nothing.

19:23.684 --> 19:26.991
I mean, she filed for a divorce
and was leaving him is all.

19:32.258 --> 19:36.653
Well, at least the drive's
not too far for you.

19:36.740 --> 19:39.047
- Has anyone else applied
for their room yet?

19:39.134 --> 19:40.875
- I have a couple people
scheduled to come see it later,

19:41.005 --> 19:42.659
but you're the first.

19:43.878 --> 19:46.185
But look, if you're
ready to commit,

19:46.272 --> 19:49.405
I guess I could cancel and
tell them I found somebody.

19:49.492 --> 19:52.321
Um, yeah.

19:52.408 --> 19:53.757
- Great.

19:53.844 --> 19:55.063
As soon as you can get me
the first month and deposit,

19:55.194 --> 19:57.370
I would be glad to
give you the key.

20:02.026 --> 20:03.463
- Well, I guess I'll
see you tomorrow.

20:03.550 --> 20:04.725
- Yeah, I'll be here all day.

20:26.137 --> 20:27.356
- I found a room to rent,

20:27.487 --> 20:28.966
but this has nothing to do

20:29.053 --> 20:30.533
with me not wanting
to room with you.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.579
It's just that Marco
knows where you live,

20:32.709 --> 20:33.493
and I just think
it would be better

20:33.580 --> 20:35.059
if he didn't know where I was.

20:36.626 --> 20:37.758
- I wasn't gonna say anything,

20:37.845 --> 20:41.370
but he stopped by this
morning after you left.

20:41.501 --> 20:42.850
- I'm so sorry.

20:42.980 --> 20:44.068
- It's fine, I...

20:45.592 --> 20:47.855
Promise me you won't
go back to him.

20:47.942 --> 20:51.206
- I promise. I'm 100%
done with psychos forever.

22:05.846 --> 22:06.847
Here.

22:12.983 --> 22:13.767
- Hey!

22:15.246 --> 22:16.160
- Let me help you.

22:16.247 --> 22:16.987
- Thanks.

22:43.144 --> 22:44.058
- I gave her those.

22:45.102 --> 22:46.365
- They're so cute.

22:53.241 --> 22:55.548
- Wow, this place is gorgeous.

22:55.635 --> 22:56.331
- Thank you.

22:57.637 --> 22:59.290
- Ange told me you were
a fashion designer.

22:59.421 --> 23:01.380
Maybe I should have gone
into fashion design.

23:03.382 --> 23:07.342
- It's not for everyone,
but to be honest,

23:07.473 --> 23:09.736
I don't really make enough
to afford a place like this.

23:09.823 --> 23:13.696
I just inherited a bunch of
money when my parents died.

23:13.783 --> 23:15.742
- Mm, I'm sorry.

23:15.829 --> 23:16.830
- It was a long time ago.

23:20.616 --> 23:21.574
- Well, that's it.

23:23.837 --> 23:24.533
- Come here.

23:25.795 --> 23:27.275
Why do I feel like I'm
dropping off my kid

23:27.406 --> 23:29.190
at camp or something?

23:29.277 --> 23:30.409
I'm gonna
miss you so much.

23:32.062 --> 23:33.194
- Let's go out for
drinks next week.

23:33.324 --> 23:34.674
Yeah.

23:34.761 --> 23:36.284
- Want me to help you unpack?

23:36.415 --> 23:38.025
- Oh, you might wanna
move your car first.

23:38.155 --> 23:40.462
They ticket a lot around here.

23:40.593 --> 23:41.942
- It's fine. Just go.

23:42.029 --> 23:42.856
I'll text you later.

23:45.032 --> 23:46.990
- Take care of my bestie, okay?

23:47.121 --> 23:49.384
- Don't worry, I will.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.473
Okay, so
where do you wanna go?

23:51.560 --> 23:53.301
I don't know, I
was thinking that bar in.

24:09.665 --> 24:10.361
- Need any help?

24:10.492 --> 24:12.015
- Almost done.

24:12.102 --> 24:15.454
By the way, thank you for the
bracelet. It's really pretty.

24:15.541 --> 24:16.890
- Just a little welcome gift.

24:17.020 --> 24:18.674
I got one for me, too.

24:18.805 --> 24:20.937
- You could have
just borrowed mine.

24:21.024 --> 24:21.938
- Oh, here you go.

24:23.113 --> 24:25.594
That's the key to the
front door, mailbox,

24:25.681 --> 24:27.901
Wi-Fi, and the code for
the security system.

24:27.988 --> 24:30.033
- Oh, yeah, the security system.

24:30.120 --> 24:31.078
- It's a really
safe neighborhood,

24:31.208 --> 24:33.733
but I try to keep it
on even when I'm here.

24:33.820 --> 24:35.604
- Definitely, um, about that,

24:37.040 --> 24:38.738
I probably should have
told you this yesterday,

24:38.825 --> 24:41.784
but the reason I need
a new place is because

24:41.871 --> 24:44.439
I just moved from my
boyfriend's house.

24:44.526 --> 24:46.572
- Oh, I took it you
were living with Gaby.

24:46.702 --> 24:47.660
- Just for a few days.

24:47.790 --> 24:50.619
Um, the breakup
was a little messy

24:50.706 --> 24:54.754
and he kept showing up
at Gaby's place, so.

24:54.841 --> 24:56.233
- I see.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.844
- I just didn't want you to
think that I was gonna bring

24:57.931 --> 24:59.193
a bunch of drama or anything.

25:00.716 --> 25:03.458
- Not everyone handles
it well when things end.

25:03.589 --> 25:04.415
What's this guy's name?

25:04.546 --> 25:05.242
- Marco.

25:05.329 --> 25:07.157
- Well, Marco's history.

25:09.116 --> 25:11.466
This is a new beginning
for you and to celebrate,

25:11.553 --> 25:12.467
I think we should-

25:15.165 --> 25:16.515
- I'm sorry. This is my mom.

25:16.645 --> 25:17.385
- Go ahead.

25:20.040 --> 25:22.651
- Hey, Mom, no, it's not
really a great time to talk.

25:25.175 --> 25:28.222
Because I wanted to let
you know that I moved.

25:28.309 --> 25:30.224
I found this incredible place

25:30.354 --> 25:34.663
near the beach with an
amazing roommate.

25:34.750 --> 25:36.535
No, uh, Marco and
I are done for goo.

25:38.362 --> 25:39.320
What?

25:41.670 --> 25:42.715
You can't be serious.

25:47.502 --> 25:48.547
- So what are you gonna do?

25:48.634 --> 25:50.679
- I have to get it
back. I have no choice.

25:51.854 --> 25:52.855
I just can't believe

25:52.942 --> 25:54.596
that he told my mom
he wanted to propose.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.598
What was he thinking?

25:56.685 --> 25:58.252
And I can't believe that
she would just give him

25:58.339 --> 25:59.340
my grandmother's ring.

25:59.427 --> 26:01.385
That's even crazier.

26:01.516 --> 26:02.996
- Well, what's done is done.

26:03.126 --> 26:04.084
But now that you're broken up,

26:04.214 --> 26:06.042
I'm sure he'll give
the ring back, right?

26:06.173 --> 26:07.653
- You don't know Marco.

26:07.740 --> 26:08.958
That's the guy
that threw a brick

26:09.045 --> 26:10.438
at Gaby's door at
two in the morning.

26:12.309 --> 26:14.137
- I can go get it if you want.

26:14.268 --> 26:16.531
- No, this is my
problem, not yours.

26:16.662 --> 26:20.579
- Hey, we're roommates now.
Your problems are my problems.

26:20.666 --> 26:22.406
That sounded weird.
You know what I mean.

26:22.537 --> 26:24.583
- Let me think about the best
way to handle this, okay?

26:24.670 --> 26:25.453
- Of course.

26:49.869 --> 26:50.609
- Goodnight.

26:50.696 --> 26:51.914
- Oh hey, come here a sec.

26:58.834 --> 27:01.445
What do you think? It's
for my latest line.

27:01.532 --> 27:03.099
- That's a beautiful jacket.

27:06.233 --> 27:07.626
You're really talented.

27:08.931 --> 27:09.628
- Try it on.

27:21.552 --> 27:23.859
That looks so good on you.

27:23.990 --> 27:27.428
- I'll say, I've never
leather this soft.

27:27.515 --> 27:28.690
- Well, how do you feel in it?

27:28.821 --> 27:32.694
- I don't know,
um, I feel stylish,

27:32.781 --> 27:35.044
confident, and
definitely wealthy.

27:35.175 --> 27:37.351
I mean, how much does
this sell for anyway?

27:37.438 --> 27:39.266
- Oh, for you, gratis.

27:39.353 --> 27:40.180
- Are you kidding?

27:41.572 --> 27:43.836
- No, I have like 500
more I need to unload.

27:43.923 --> 27:48.362
So trust me, keep it, but
let's mark the moment.

27:49.493 --> 27:52.235
Okay.

27:54.411 --> 27:55.151
Yes. Okay.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.945
Look how cute we are.

28:06.032 --> 28:08.121
Oh, and your hair is gorgeous.

28:08.251 --> 28:09.731
- You think so?

28:09.818 --> 28:11.515
I was thinking about going
back to my natural collar.

28:11.602 --> 28:13.866
- No, you definitely
don't wanna do that.

28:13.953 --> 28:16.172
You should wear it up more.

28:17.913 --> 28:20.220
- Marco used to say that
my hair looked better down.

28:20.350 --> 28:21.525
- Mm, well, Marco's a loser.

28:25.660 --> 28:28.184
I love this pic.
Okay, I'll tag us

28:28.271 --> 28:29.272
real quick.
- Oh, maybe you shouldn't

28:29.359 --> 28:32.232
just because I wouldn't
want Marco to, you know.

28:32.319 --> 28:34.016
- Of course. Right.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.280
- Well, I'm gonna go take
a shower and go to bed,

28:37.411 --> 28:39.195
but thank you so
much for the jacket.

28:39.282 --> 28:40.240
I really love it.

28:40.327 --> 28:42.416
- You're welcome, Angelina.

28:55.472 --> 28:56.212
Angelina.

28:59.215 --> 29:00.173
He sent me an angel.

29:55.097 --> 29:58.231
♪ You are not forgotten ♪

29:58.318 --> 30:01.800
♪ Know I will always be here ♪

30:07.414 --> 30:10.504
♪ I will always be here ♪

30:23.865 --> 30:24.779
Marco!

30:24.866 --> 30:25.693
Polo!

30:31.003 --> 30:31.786
Polo!

30:35.659 --> 30:36.356
Polo!

30:38.532 --> 30:39.794
Marco!

30:40.926 --> 30:42.014
Polo!

31:00.162 --> 31:01.033
- Angelina.

31:01.163 --> 31:02.295
- Hi.

31:02.425 --> 31:03.818
- What's going on?

31:03.949 --> 31:06.125
- You have my grandmother's
ring and I, I need it back.

31:08.997 --> 31:12.479
- Okay, yeah, yeah,
um, how about we, uh,

31:12.609 --> 31:15.656
meet up for dinner and, uh,
I can give it to you then.

31:15.786 --> 31:18.180
- That's not a good idea.
Can I just come and get it?

31:19.834 --> 31:23.185
- Sure, yeah, whatever
makes Angelina happy.

31:24.839 --> 31:26.406
Can you be here in an hour?

31:26.536 --> 31:28.799
- Okay. I'll, I'll see then.

31:28.930 --> 31:29.539
- Bye, gorgeous.

32:12.495 --> 32:13.801
- What's wrong?

32:13.888 --> 32:18.197
- I called Marco and he said
I can come get the ring.

32:18.284 --> 32:20.677
- Oh, well, that's great, right?

32:20.764 --> 32:22.288
- Yeah, I still
have his house keys

32:22.375 --> 32:24.420
so I can give that to
him, he gives me the ring,

32:24.507 --> 32:26.509
and I never have to
see him ever again.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.381
- Great.

32:28.468 --> 32:30.557
- It's just that
even the thought

32:30.687 --> 32:33.342
of seeing him turns
my stomach into knots.

32:33.429 --> 32:34.648
- I'll go with you.

32:34.778 --> 32:36.911
- No, I don't want
you to do that.

32:36.998 --> 32:38.304
- I don't mind.

32:38.391 --> 32:39.958
Besides, after everything
you told me about him,

32:40.045 --> 32:41.829
I don't think you should
be alone with him.

32:43.178 --> 32:44.310
- Are you sure?

32:44.397 --> 32:47.574
- 100%. Besides that's
what sisters do, friends,

32:50.316 --> 32:51.534
I mean, that's what friends do.

32:54.015 --> 32:56.365
- Thank you. That
really means a lot.

33:11.772 --> 33:14.166
- Baby, right on time.

33:14.253 --> 33:16.168
You look great, by the way.

33:16.255 --> 33:17.604
- This is my friend, Nina.

33:19.258 --> 33:21.173
- Nice to meet you, Nina.

33:21.260 --> 33:23.827
You're much
prettier than the gun

33:23.958 --> 33:26.526
that she bought the
last time.

33:28.223 --> 33:29.703
Please come in.

33:39.017 --> 33:43.717
Um, excuse the mess.

33:43.847 --> 33:47.982
I've been picking up a lot
of night shifts lately,

33:48.069 --> 33:50.115
so I haven't had
time to really clean,

33:50.245 --> 33:54.032
but loving the overtime, though.

33:54.119 --> 33:57.644
Just, um, I work is
an ambulance driver

33:57.774 --> 34:00.473
for one of the biggest
ambulatory services

34:00.603 --> 34:01.865
on the west coast, so.

34:01.996 --> 34:04.912
- I'm sure you're pretty
busy, so if you could just get

34:04.999 --> 34:06.566
the ring, we'll be
out of your way.

34:08.045 --> 34:11.353
- Okay, okay, would
you like to sit down?

34:11.484 --> 34:12.527
- The ring.

34:12.614 --> 34:16.228
- You can have the
ring if you say yes.

34:18.578 --> 34:22.321
You're my heart and
soul, Angelina, my angel.

34:24.496 --> 34:25.585
Will you marry me?

34:25.672 --> 34:28.543
I, I, this isn't the
way I envisioned it,

34:30.545 --> 34:32.547
but before you say anything,

34:32.635 --> 34:37.074
I want you to know it
took you leaving me

34:37.161 --> 34:38.119
to understand what it was

34:38.206 --> 34:39.773
you were trying to
tell me all along,

34:41.382 --> 34:43.210
that I didn't appreciate you

34:44.560 --> 34:47.215
the way you deserve
to be treated,

34:47.302 --> 34:48.260
and I wanna spend
the rest of my life

34:48.347 --> 34:50.391
making sure you know
what a queen you are.

34:51.828 --> 34:55.266
- Marco, no, just, I
don't wanna marry you.

34:55.353 --> 34:56.268
- So you don't love me.

34:57.443 --> 34:59.662
You, you said the kind of love

34:59.749 --> 35:01.838
that you have for
me could never die.

35:01.925 --> 35:04.450
- I know I said
that, but, I just...

35:04.537 --> 35:06.582
- I know, I know, I get
it. I, I get it, I do.

35:07.714 --> 35:08.889
You're confused right now,

35:09.019 --> 35:13.285
but let me prove to you that
I'm still all those things

35:13.372 --> 35:14.634
that you fell in love with.

35:14.764 --> 35:16.070
- She said she doesn't
wanna marry you.

35:16.201 --> 35:17.115
Just give her the ring.

35:17.245 --> 35:19.639
- Whoa, mind your
business, bitch.

35:19.726 --> 35:20.727
Marco.

35:20.814 --> 35:23.208
- What, are you
sleeping with that guy?

35:24.339 --> 35:25.427
You are, aren't you?

35:25.558 --> 35:26.994
- What guy?

35:27.081 --> 35:30.258
- The loser you brought
over last time. I knew it.

35:30.389 --> 35:32.608
- Okay, you're just acting
a little crazy right now.

35:32.695 --> 35:35.785
- Oh, oh, this is, no, no,
this is what happens to guys

35:35.872 --> 35:38.223
when you smash their
hearts to pieces.

35:38.353 --> 35:40.790
I never should have
trusted you, Angelina!

35:40.877 --> 35:42.618
- Last chance. Give her the
ring or I'm calling the cops.

35:42.705 --> 35:44.968
- Call 'em. Do it.

35:45.055 --> 35:48.146
The two of you will be dead
by the time they get here.

35:49.625 --> 35:50.670
- We're going.
- Yeah.

35:50.800 --> 35:53.716
Yeah, you think you can
come into my house, huh,

35:53.847 --> 35:54.891
and threaten me.

35:54.978 --> 35:56.154
- My mistake.
- You think you can?

35:59.287 --> 36:00.201
- Did you know he had a gun?

36:00.332 --> 36:01.985
- No! Go, go, go, go!

36:20.656 --> 36:22.919
What am I gonna
do about the ring?

36:23.006 --> 36:25.226
It was the ring my grandpa gave
my grandma at their wedding.

36:25.313 --> 36:27.924
Like, everyone in
my family wanted it.

36:28.011 --> 36:30.144
- Don't worry about
that right now.

36:30.231 --> 36:32.190
All that matters is that
you're away from him.

36:33.843 --> 36:36.498
I can't imagine what it
was like living there.

36:36.629 --> 36:39.066
- He wasn't like that
in the beginning.

36:39.153 --> 36:41.547
He was actually really
sweet and vulnerable.

36:43.331 --> 36:46.073
It's just, he grew up in such
a toxic family, you know?

36:46.160 --> 36:47.727
I was the first
person to show him

36:47.814 --> 36:49.076
what it was like to be loved.

36:51.121 --> 36:52.166
- But if he never knew love,

36:52.297 --> 36:54.168
how was he going to know
how to love you back?

36:58.216 --> 37:00.609
I came from a similar situation.

37:00.696 --> 37:02.916
My parents were
awful to each other

37:04.526 --> 37:06.354
and to me and Amelia.

37:06.441 --> 37:07.007
- Your sister.

37:10.402 --> 37:11.838
- They abused her worse than me.

37:13.753 --> 37:15.058
To this day, I don't know why,

37:15.145 --> 37:17.757
but I knew I had to
get us out of there.

37:19.802 --> 37:22.240
I convinced my grandmother
to let us move in with her.

37:25.939 --> 37:27.636
Unfortunately, Amelia
was never really able

37:27.723 --> 37:31.292
to put everything that had
happened in the past behind her.

37:31.379 --> 37:32.380
- What do you mean?

37:35.253 --> 37:37.255
- She missed our
mom and dad so much,

37:39.605 --> 37:41.955
these people who had hurt her,

37:46.351 --> 37:48.875
and I tried to take care of her

37:49.005 --> 37:51.573
and I tried so hard to
make her feel loved.

37:51.704 --> 37:53.662
I thought that if we
just stuck together,

37:53.749 --> 37:54.446
it would be enough, but,

37:56.186 --> 37:58.276
but she just went in
and out of depression.

37:58.406 --> 37:59.277
- It's okay.

38:00.843 --> 38:02.018
- And then we got the call
that my parents had been killed

38:02.105 --> 38:06.893
in a car accident, and when
I heard that, I felt like,

38:08.938 --> 38:10.592
I felt like a burden
had been lifted.

38:12.159 --> 38:13.900
I felt like we
were finally free.

38:15.989 --> 38:18.426
And then that night I went with
my grandmother to the store,

38:18.513 --> 38:22.648
and when we came back,
Amelia had cut her wrists,

38:25.172 --> 38:26.695
and she had been
waiting for us to leave

38:26.782 --> 38:28.828
so we wouldn't be
there to stop her.

38:28.915 --> 38:30.917
- Bianca, I'm so sorry.

38:34.921 --> 38:36.270
- I just miss her so much.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.711
I tried to make her feel loved.

38:42.842 --> 38:45.410
- It must have been
so hard for you

38:45.540 --> 38:47.716
not understanding why
you couldn't prevent it.

38:47.803 --> 38:48.935
- I mean, if only
I'd just done more.

38:49.065 --> 38:51.981
- No, Bianca, it was nothing
that you did or didn't do.

38:53.679 --> 38:55.289
- I wish Amelia was still here.

39:00.033 --> 39:01.339
I wish I had my little sister.

39:20.836 --> 39:22.708
- It honestly
doesn't surprise me.

39:22.795 --> 39:25.580
He's gotten progressively
psycho since you met him.

39:25.711 --> 39:27.147
- You're right. I
shouldn't have gone there.

39:27.277 --> 39:29.018
It was a bad idea.

39:29.105 --> 39:30.629
I'm just glad that
Bianca was with me.

39:30.759 --> 39:32.326
I mean, who knows what
could have happened

39:32.457 --> 39:34.284
if I'd gone alone.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.677
- You should have taken Diego.

39:37.418 --> 39:40.203
I guess he told Marco
that you deserved better.

39:40.290 --> 39:42.075
- Oh my gosh, that's
why Marco accused me

39:42.205 --> 39:43.729
of sleeping with him.

39:43.859 --> 39:45.121
You're kidding.

39:45.208 --> 39:48.124
- No, Marco is so
jealous of Diego.

39:48.255 --> 39:49.169
- Diego?

39:49.299 --> 39:51.040
- For good reason.

39:51.127 --> 39:54.130
Diego's smart, articulate,
more attractive,

39:54.217 --> 39:55.915
and people actually
enjoy his company.

39:57.482 --> 39:59.788
- But I still need to
get that ring back.

39:59.919 --> 40:03.357
My whole family's gonna hate
me if I'm the reason it's gone.

40:03.444 --> 40:06.012
- You? Your mom's the
one that gave it to him.

40:06.142 --> 40:07.796
- No, I always told
her things were great,

40:07.883 --> 40:08.928
so it's not her fault.

40:09.015 --> 40:10.756
- Contact a lawyer.

40:10.843 --> 40:11.757
There's gotta be a legal way

40:11.887 --> 40:13.454
to make him give
you the ring back.

40:13.585 --> 40:14.673
- Yeah maybe.

40:14.803 --> 40:16.239
- You wanna go out for
drinks tomorrow night.

40:16.370 --> 40:19.112
Yes. Drinks
tomorrow night would be perfect.

44:07.775 --> 44:08.646
- Not so fast, bitch!

44:10.299 --> 44:14.564
Give me one good
reason why I shouldn't shoot

44:14.695 --> 44:16.523
that pretty little face.

44:16.654 --> 44:19.657
- She just wants the ring
pick. It belongs to her.

44:23.443 --> 44:28.100
- Well, we don't always
get what we want, huh?

44:29.971 --> 44:31.886
I want her to come back, but I
don't think that's happening.

44:31.973 --> 44:34.715
- I'll buy it from
you. I have money.

44:34.802 --> 44:39.372
- The ring is an heirloom,
mm? It's not for sale.

44:42.288 --> 44:45.030
- What if, um, what if I
could convince Angelina

44:45.160 --> 44:46.335
to give you another chance?

44:50.644 --> 44:52.385
- Who are you, anyway?

44:52.472 --> 44:53.429
- I'm her therapist.

44:55.475 --> 44:59.871
I know everything about
you and your relationship.

45:02.743 --> 45:04.484
I know you're not a
bad person, Marco.

45:06.051 --> 45:09.532
It's not your fault that you
had the childhood you did.

45:09.663 --> 45:11.447
Children that come
from toxic homes

45:11.578 --> 45:13.536
are never taught
how to express love,

45:15.103 --> 45:16.017
but I know you love her.

45:16.104 --> 45:17.192
- Yeah.

45:17.323 --> 45:18.672
- And you can learn to do that.

45:20.456 --> 45:23.982
And Angelina's great, but
she's not perfect, either.

45:27.159 --> 45:28.900
I'd love to hear your
side of the story.

45:31.380 --> 45:34.253
Maybe we can sit down, talk.

45:36.559 --> 45:37.386
Okay.

45:40.389 --> 45:42.435
- And that's whenever I
left my second foster home

45:42.522 --> 45:45.264
and moved back with my
dad and his third wife.

45:47.527 --> 45:50.225
Yeah, that's the part
Angelina can never understand.

45:50.356 --> 45:55.013
You know, she has great
parents, and her mom adores me.

45:56.928 --> 45:58.364
- Well, it sounds like her
mother knows more about

45:58.451 --> 46:00.758
what's best for Angelina
than Angelina does.

46:00.845 --> 46:01.541
- Exactly.

46:05.806 --> 46:06.764
- Tell me about Diego.

46:09.070 --> 46:10.506
- Is she sleeping with him?

46:10.593 --> 46:11.290
- No.

46:14.249 --> 46:14.946
- Good.

46:16.686 --> 46:19.124
- She never mentioned
him in our sessions.

46:21.213 --> 46:23.215
She just said that he
came with her and Gaby

46:23.302 --> 46:24.651
when they moved her things out.

46:28.220 --> 46:29.134
- I guess he works with Gaby.

46:29.264 --> 46:32.093
You know, she's
another one that tries

46:32.180 --> 46:34.792
to get an Angelina's
head and break us up.

46:38.317 --> 46:40.362
- Yeah, well, Gaby definitely

46:40.449 --> 46:41.799
has an unhealthy
hold on Angelina.

46:41.886 --> 46:42.756
- I know!

46:42.843 --> 46:44.062
- Mm.
- I know.

46:47.369 --> 46:48.066
You're good.

46:50.764 --> 46:52.592
You know, I used to put
much stock in therapists,

46:52.679 --> 46:55.595
but I feel you see
what it's really like.

46:57.162 --> 46:57.902
- Thanks.

46:57.989 --> 46:58.685
- Yeah.

47:01.819 --> 47:03.603
- Do you mind if I
grab one of those?

47:03.733 --> 47:06.693
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll get it.

47:06.780 --> 47:11.524
Uh, think I might
be out of those,

47:12.481 --> 47:15.963
but I have, uh, water,

47:16.094 --> 47:17.747
um, orange juice,

47:19.837 --> 47:22.752
uh, some kombucha Angelina left.

47:24.102 --> 47:25.146
No!

47:33.502 --> 47:36.462
Oh, god.

47:38.203 --> 47:40.161
- I'm sick of hearing
about your childhood.

47:41.380 --> 47:42.729
Now tell me where the ring is,

47:44.557 --> 47:45.863
and I'll call you an ambulance.

47:48.213 --> 47:49.867
- Hopefully they have
somebody to drive it.

47:51.346 --> 47:53.609
Skull fractures can
be serious, Marco.

47:53.740 --> 47:55.568
- Please call.

47:55.655 --> 47:56.569
- What's the passcode.

47:57.700 --> 47:58.876
- 2008.

48:02.575 --> 48:03.837
- Where's the ring?

48:03.968 --> 48:05.317
- In my pocket.

48:05.404 --> 48:06.666
- Give it to me.

48:06.796 --> 48:07.885
- Oh god. Okay.

48:34.781 --> 48:35.738
- Don't worry.

48:35.825 --> 48:37.088
- Oh god.

48:37.218 --> 48:39.307
- Your legacy will live on.

48:39.394 --> 48:40.221
- No. No!

49:01.503 --> 49:02.765
- Good morning.

49:02.852 --> 49:03.941
- Hey, how'd you sleep?

49:05.246 --> 49:06.944
- I dreamt about him.

49:08.293 --> 49:10.208
- That's funny. I
dreamt about him, too.

49:10.295 --> 49:13.428
Except in my dream, I'm the
one that pulled a gun on him.

49:14.647 --> 49:16.214
No, no, no, it's
great, actually,

49:16.301 --> 49:17.345
because I woke up this morning

49:17.476 --> 49:19.695
and I realized exactly
what we need to do.

49:19.782 --> 49:20.914
- You did?

49:21.045 --> 49:22.916
- I'm sure you have photos

49:23.003 --> 49:25.005
of your grandma wearing
that ring, right?

49:25.092 --> 49:26.485
- My mom does, yeah.

49:26.615 --> 49:29.705
- Well then, legally it
doesn't belong to him,

49:29.836 --> 49:33.013
and under the state's replevin
laws, he has to return it.

49:33.144 --> 49:34.536
You just have to
file a court order.

49:34.623 --> 49:37.626
- Really? How do
you know all this?

49:37.713 --> 49:40.368
- I spoke with an attorney
friend of mine this morning

49:40.455 --> 49:42.370
and she's willing
to do it pro bono.

49:42.457 --> 49:44.807
That
is amazing.

49:44.938 --> 49:46.026
- It could take a few weeks.

49:46.157 --> 49:48.724
- It's fine, I mean, as
long as I get it back.

49:48.855 --> 49:50.335
Oh my gosh, thank you so much.

49:50.422 --> 49:51.814
This is such a weight lifted.

49:51.901 --> 49:53.207
- No problem.

49:53.294 --> 49:54.556
- It's funny 'cause
Gaby also told me

49:54.643 --> 49:55.905
to take the legal route.

49:55.993 --> 49:58.604
I guess I was the only one
who didn't think of it.

49:58.734 --> 50:00.998
- Well, we should go out
tonight and celebrate.

50:01.085 --> 50:03.348
- That would be terrific.

50:03.435 --> 50:06.351
Oh no, wait. I already
have plans with Gaby.

50:06.438 --> 50:08.048
- Break 'em.

50:09.223 --> 50:12.705
- Or maybe we could go
out the three of us.

50:12.792 --> 50:14.054
Are you down for that?

50:14.185 --> 50:15.447
- Yeah, sure.

50:36.294 --> 50:37.773
- Ms. Harrison.

50:37.860 --> 50:39.123
- Hey, Dylan. How's it going?

50:39.210 --> 50:40.167
Come on in.
- Oh, it's cool.

50:40.254 --> 50:41.821
I'm actually headed
to play some ball,

50:41.908 --> 50:45.564
but, um, I just wanted to let
you know that I got accepted.

50:45.694 --> 50:47.305
- To the school
on the east coast?

50:47.392 --> 50:48.654
- Yeah.

50:48.741 --> 50:52.527
- Oh Dylan, that's amazing!
I'm so proud of you.

50:52.614 --> 50:53.876
- Thank you.

50:54.007 --> 50:56.444
Um, it's really
like you said it.

50:56.531 --> 50:59.056
Strange how quickly
things can change.

51:00.318 --> 51:02.450
Anyway, I'll catch you later.

51:02.537 --> 51:03.538
- Sounds good.

51:41.663 --> 51:42.969
- Hey, how was your day?

51:44.840 --> 51:45.450
- Really great.

51:47.539 --> 51:51.630
- Well, it's about to
get a whole lot better.

51:51.717 --> 51:52.979
I have a little gift for you.

52:00.029 --> 52:02.293
I made it just for
you. What do you think?

52:03.468 --> 52:05.470
- You made this for me?

52:05.557 --> 52:06.862
- I thought that maybe
you could wear it

52:06.949 --> 52:08.864
when we go out tonight.

52:08.995 --> 52:10.997
- Wow, I, I don't
even know what to say.

52:12.129 --> 52:13.478
- You like it, though, right?

52:13.608 --> 52:16.611
- Of course. I
mean, it's gorgeous.

52:23.096 --> 52:25.359
- Well, I've been
working on it all day,

52:25.446 --> 52:28.319
so I have to go
shower and get ready.

53:03.049 --> 53:04.703
- Okay, perfect.
I'll see you later.

53:07.662 --> 53:08.359
What the?

53:09.882 --> 53:11.100
- Hola, chica!

53:11.188 --> 53:11.884
Hey.

53:16.497 --> 53:19.892
- Hi, it's so good
to see you again.

53:19.979 --> 53:20.893
- You, too.

53:22.895 --> 53:25.071
- Bianca made this dress
for me. Isn't it cute?

53:26.507 --> 53:29.075
- Yeah. Did you
make that one too?

53:29.206 --> 53:30.642
- Yep.

53:30.729 --> 53:33.384
Oh, uh, excuse me,
can I get a bottle

53:33.514 --> 53:35.299
of champagne and
two glasses, please?

53:35.386 --> 53:36.735
- Actually I'll have some, too.

53:37.910 --> 53:38.737
- Okay, make that three.

53:40.478 --> 53:41.957
And then we had
to walk three miles back

53:42.088 --> 53:44.482
to the hotel because you
left her purse inside

53:44.569 --> 53:45.831
and they already
locked the door.

53:45.918 --> 53:48.355
- I don't know how we didn't
get mugged or something.

53:48.442 --> 53:50.531
That trip was crazy.

53:50.618 --> 53:52.141
- Oh, and do you
remember the next day

53:52.229 --> 53:54.535
when we took the bus downtown?

53:54.622 --> 53:55.971
That was so stupid.

53:56.058 --> 53:58.147
Can y'all
excuse me for a sec?

53:58.235 --> 53:59.540
I just need to use the restroom.

53:59.627 --> 54:00.889
- Sure.

54:00.976 --> 54:01.760
- Angelina?

54:01.847 --> 54:02.587
- I'll say here.

54:09.115 --> 54:11.509
- Okay, what's up with
the matching dress?

54:11.596 --> 54:14.990
I think we're
twinnies.

54:15.077 --> 54:17.602
Maybe she only
knows how to design one thing.

54:26.785 --> 54:29.222
- So aside from
wanting to dress you

54:29.309 --> 54:32.181
from head to toe, how's it been?

54:32.312 --> 54:32.965
- Pretty good.

54:33.922 --> 54:34.793
- Convincing.

54:36.577 --> 54:39.363
- Sometimes I feel like she's
a bit too preoccupied with me.

54:39.493 --> 54:40.451
She stares a lot.

54:42.583 --> 54:44.019
- Like at the wall?

54:44.150 --> 54:46.718
- Yeah. Or at me.

54:46.805 --> 54:47.936
I don't know where
her mind's at,

54:48.023 --> 54:49.808
but it's clearly somewhere else.

55:06.433 --> 55:08.522
It's like she wants
to be my best friend

55:08.609 --> 55:10.872
even though we hardly
know each other.

55:11.003 --> 55:12.613
- That's weird.

55:12.700 --> 55:14.702
- I'm probably overstating it.

55:14.789 --> 55:16.878
I mean, she's really
great in many ways.

55:17.009 --> 55:18.880
She's having her friend
file a court order

55:18.967 --> 55:20.012
for me against Marco.

55:23.015 --> 55:24.712
Speaking of Marco.

55:24.799 --> 55:25.322
- What?

55:26.845 --> 55:30.022
"I poured my heart out

55:30.109 --> 55:32.241
and you stomped all over it.

55:32.329 --> 55:34.287
Girls like you deserve
what they get."

55:34.418 --> 55:37.508
- That's a threat. You need
to show that to the cops.

56:11.672 --> 56:15.720
You're
a bad boy, Marco.

56:24.424 --> 56:25.425
- Yeah, but if the
cops go talk to Marco,

56:25.512 --> 56:27.384
it's only gonna
make him angrier.

56:27.471 --> 56:29.734
- Well, what do you think
a court order is gonna do?

56:33.651 --> 56:34.521
Hey.

56:34.608 --> 56:35.957
- Diego's here?

56:36.088 --> 56:39.483
- Uh, I, uh, invited
him as a surprise.

56:39.570 --> 56:40.701
- Gaby!
- What?

56:40.832 --> 56:42.268
He keeps asking about you.

56:42.399 --> 56:43.095
- Hey.

56:43.182 --> 56:43.922
- Hi.
- Hi.

56:45.097 --> 56:47.316
- Uh, I'll go get
us another round.

56:47.404 --> 56:48.666
- Yeah, yeah.
- Scotch neat, right?

56:48.796 --> 56:49.754
- Yes, sure. Thanks.

56:51.843 --> 56:52.887
It's nice seeing you again.

56:55.020 --> 56:57.936
So how are you doing?

56:59.067 --> 56:59.851
- Okay.

56:59.938 --> 57:01.243
I'm definitely in a better place

57:01.374 --> 57:02.244
than the last time you saw me.

57:02.331 --> 57:04.116
- That's great to hear.

57:06.248 --> 57:08.207
Has he been leaving you alone?

57:08.337 --> 57:11.166
- No, but he'll get
the picture eventually.

57:11.297 --> 57:12.037
- Yeah.

57:13.473 --> 57:15.823

friend Diego from work.

57:23.962 --> 57:24.963
They have little
thing for each other,

57:25.093 --> 57:27.052
so I'm giving them some space.

57:42.197 --> 57:43.329
- Nice to meet you. Diego.

57:47.725 --> 57:50.597
- Uh, so how are things at
the community center going?

57:50.684 --> 57:51.511
- Really great.

57:51.642 --> 57:52.947
- Yeah?

57:53.034 --> 57:55.297
- This kid I consult just
got accepted into college.

57:55.384 --> 57:56.385
- Oh boy, that's amazing.

57:56.516 --> 57:57.604
Yeah.

57:57.735 --> 57:58.518
- It must feel good to know

57:58.605 --> 58:00.085
you're really
making a difference.

58:02.261 --> 58:03.480
- So what do you do, Diego?

58:05.177 --> 58:09.268
- Oh, um, I work with
Gaby at the ad agency.

58:09.398 --> 58:11.009
I'm a junior partner there.

58:11.139 --> 58:14.142
Oh, that's so cute,
Junior.

58:14.229 --> 58:15.666
Thanks, Gaby.

58:17.494 --> 58:20.018
- So Diego, tell
Ange the good news.

58:20.148 --> 58:21.715
- What is it?

58:21.802 --> 58:23.325
- I just landed
the biggest client

58:23.412 --> 58:25.414
our company has ever had.

58:25.545 --> 58:28.156
- Congratulations! I
wanna hear all about it.

58:28.287 --> 58:32.726
- Um, so basically this has
been a long time coming and,

58:32.813 --> 58:35.381
uh, yeah, Gaby
knows all about it.

58:35.468 --> 58:36.469
She can tell you
a little bit more.

58:38.210 --> 58:39.864
Maybe next time.

58:39.994 --> 58:40.865
- No, but
it's definitely,
it's been about five,

58:40.952 --> 58:43.345
six months and today
we finalized the deal

58:43.476 --> 58:45.870
and it looks like it's gonna
be about seven figures, so.

58:47.088 --> 58:47.915
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

58:48.046 --> 58:48.612
- Thank you.

58:51.049 --> 58:52.050
- Thank you.
- Thank.

58:52.180 --> 58:53.399
- This is me.

58:53.530 --> 58:55.749
- Thank you so much for
taking me out tonight.

58:55.880 --> 58:58.404
I haven't had this much
fun in a long time.

58:58.535 --> 59:00.972
Anytime,
love. I'll see ya.

59:01.102 --> 59:03.844
- Gaby, holy crap. I think
someone keyed your car.

59:03.931 --> 59:05.193
What?

59:05.324 --> 59:06.630
- It was him. It had to be.

59:06.717 --> 59:09.894
- Marco? No, I mean, how would
he even know we were here?

59:09.981 --> 59:11.330
- I forgot to tell you,

59:11.417 --> 59:13.898
but he texted me tonight while
you were in the bathroom.

59:14.028 --> 59:15.334
- He might have followed Gaby.

59:16.944 --> 59:18.467
And I don't see any
security cameras around here

59:18.598 --> 59:21.122
so there's like no
proof that he was here.

59:21.253 --> 59:22.733
- Look, I'm gonna go have
a chat with this guy.

59:22.820 --> 59:24.169
- No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

59:24.256 --> 59:26.301
- Me either. I'll just
pay for the damage.

59:26.388 --> 59:28.390
- No, he should do it.

59:28.477 --> 59:30.828
- Okay, I think we should
all go home, get some rest,

59:30.915 --> 59:33.918
and tomorrow, we'll be
more clear-minded, okay?

59:34.048 --> 59:35.659
- I can try to bring
some rubbing compound
over the weekend

59:35.789 --> 59:37.312
and see what I can do.

59:37.443 --> 59:38.531
- Okay.

59:38.618 --> 59:41.926
- Hey, drive safe.
We'll figure it out.

59:42.013 --> 59:43.623
- Okay. Bye.

59:43.754 --> 59:44.406
- Bye.

59:49.760 --> 59:51.109
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:00:01.641 --> 01:00:02.773
- Thank you.

01:00:04.165 --> 01:00:06.515
All right, well, it was
great meeting you, Diego.

01:00:06.646 --> 01:00:07.952
Um, Ange, let's go.

01:00:08.082 --> 01:00:09.518
- Can you just give me a second?

01:00:09.649 --> 01:00:10.389
- Sure.

01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:18.745
- So? Dinner next week.

01:00:18.832 --> 01:00:19.485
Yeah.

01:00:19.572 --> 01:00:20.704
I'll call you.

01:00:22.401 --> 01:00:23.620
- Don't you need my number?

01:00:23.707 --> 01:00:26.579
- You actually gave it to
me already inside, remember?

01:00:26.666 --> 01:00:30.322
I believe it was right after
your fifth glass of champagne.

01:00:31.802 --> 01:00:34.413
- Yeah, I usually
don't drink this much.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:35.719
- It's all good.

01:00:37.068 --> 01:00:38.547
Well, goodnight, Angelina.

01:00:38.678 --> 01:00:40.245
- Goodnight.

01:00:40.375 --> 01:00:41.812
- Let me get this for you.

01:00:43.161 --> 01:00:44.162
- Thank you.

01:00:44.292 --> 01:00:45.119
- Oh, you're
welcome. Bye, Bianca.

01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:46.643
Drive safe. Nice meeting you.

01:00:52.518 --> 01:00:54.433
- That was so much
fun. Did you have fun?

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:55.826
That was so fun.

01:00:55.913 --> 01:00:57.610
- Yeah, it was a blast.

01:00:57.741 --> 01:00:59.133
- What did you
think about Diego?

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:01.396
He's kind of amazing, isn't he?

01:01:01.527 --> 01:01:02.833
- Uh, I don't know.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.573
There's something about him
that doesn't feel genuine.

01:01:04.704 --> 01:01:05.705
- Really?

01:01:05.792 --> 01:01:07.315
- Yeah, I got a
bad vibe from him.

01:01:07.446 --> 01:01:08.621
- I didn't get that at all.

01:01:09.883 --> 01:01:12.016
- Eh, well, after meeting Marco,

01:01:12.146 --> 01:01:14.801
maybe you're not so great at
sensing that kind of thing.

01:01:14.932 --> 01:01:16.498
- Well, Gaby likes him, so.

01:01:16.629 --> 01:01:19.066
- Oh, well he'd
be great for Gaby.

01:01:19.197 --> 01:01:21.025
She's got what guys
like that go for.

01:01:21.112 --> 01:01:22.287
- And what is that exactly?

01:01:23.636 --> 01:01:26.247
- Don't get me
wrong. I love Gaby.

01:01:26.378 --> 01:01:28.597
She's just kind of fake.

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:30.904
- Gaby is the most caring
and honest person I know.

01:01:31.035 --> 01:01:32.645
We've been best friends
since high school.

01:01:32.776 --> 01:01:34.386
- No, she's super sweet and,

01:01:34.516 --> 01:01:36.301
and she's super fun
to hang out with.

01:01:37.955 --> 01:01:38.912
It's just my impression of her.

01:01:39.043 --> 01:01:40.871
You obviously know
her better than I do.

01:01:41.001 --> 01:01:44.048
- Yeah I do. Think
I'm gonna go to bed.

01:01:44.178 --> 01:01:45.876
- I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to offend you.

01:01:45.963 --> 01:01:47.007
- That's fine. Goodnight.

01:01:47.138 --> 01:01:48.705
- No, I, Gaby's really cool.

01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:51.272
I can see why you two
get along so well.

01:01:51.359 --> 01:01:53.492
Amelia, don't go
to bed angry, okay?

01:01:53.579 --> 01:01:54.885
- Did you just call me Amelia?

01:01:55.973 --> 01:01:57.975
- No, I called you Angelina.

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:03.502
I'm not even gonna fight
with you. You're drunk.

01:02:47.807 --> 01:02:48.547
- Bianca?

It's a peace offering.

01:06:06.266 --> 01:06:07.615
I'm sorry about last night.

01:06:10.357 --> 01:06:12.142
- Why was there a baby
monitor in my room?

01:06:14.883 --> 01:06:16.102
- What are you talking about?

01:06:18.278 --> 01:06:21.847
Ange, I don't know anything
about a baby monitor.

01:06:25.633 --> 01:06:27.722
Maybe Sophie left it.

01:06:27.809 --> 01:06:31.813
I know her sister had some
baby stuff and she could have-

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:33.598
- Yeah, that's
probably what happened.

01:06:40.431 --> 01:06:41.519
I don't believe her story

01:06:41.606 --> 01:06:43.956
about her roommate
leaving the baby monitor.

01:06:44.043 --> 01:06:46.132
- Especially if there
was one in her room, too.

01:06:46.263 --> 01:06:47.699
- This is just
getting too weird.

01:06:49.092 --> 01:06:50.615
- You can come back here.

01:06:50.745 --> 01:06:52.530
- You're so sweet,

01:06:52.617 --> 01:06:54.836
but I just think maybe I
should get my own place.

01:06:54.923 --> 01:06:56.969
- Or maybe we can
get a place together.

01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.971
My lease here is up next month.

01:06:59.928 --> 01:07:01.278
- Oh, it's Diego.

01:07:01.408 --> 01:07:03.932
Pretend I'm not
two feet away eavesdropping.

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:04.803
- Hello?

01:07:04.933 --> 01:07:06.196
- You answered.

01:07:06.283 --> 01:07:07.849
- Did you think I wouldn't?

01:07:07.936 --> 01:07:10.635
- Well, you can be a
little hard to read,

01:07:10.722 --> 01:07:12.332
especially when you're sober.

01:07:13.116 --> 01:07:16.336
So how does tonight sound?

01:07:16.423 --> 01:07:17.120
New place that open
up in Playa del Rey

01:07:17.207 --> 01:07:19.818
that everyone is talking about.

01:07:19.948 --> 01:07:21.211
Do you like sushi?

01:07:21.298 --> 01:07:22.255
- Love it.

01:07:22.342 --> 01:07:24.344
- Perfect. May I
pick you up at seven?

01:07:24.431 --> 01:07:27.391
- Seven it is. I'll
text you the address.

01:07:27.521 --> 01:07:30.046
- Great. I'm really looking
forward to seeing you.

01:07:31.221 --> 01:07:31.917
- Me too.

01:07:34.137 --> 01:07:34.920
- You're welcome.

01:07:42.406 --> 01:07:43.059
- Okay.

01:07:53.199 --> 01:07:55.201
- I'll get that. It's Diego.

01:07:55.288 --> 01:07:56.289
- Oh, big date.

01:07:56.376 --> 01:07:58.291
I hope he's taking
you someplace nice.

01:07:58.378 --> 01:08:00.424
- Some new sushi
place by the beach.

01:08:00.511 --> 01:08:03.688
- Aw, got the roll? I
heard it's really good.

01:08:05.951 --> 01:08:06.734
- Enjoy your night.

01:08:07.996 --> 01:08:08.736
- Have fun.

01:08:29.582 --> 01:08:31.585
- What is Yuzu anyway?

01:08:31.671 --> 01:08:35.198
- I think it's a cross
between an orange and a lemon.

01:08:35.285 --> 01:08:37.068
- Wow. Are you sure about that?

01:08:37.156 --> 01:08:38.113
- No. Not at all.

01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:42.727
- Hey, so if you and Gaby
end up moving together,

01:08:42.814 --> 01:08:44.032
where do you think you'll go?

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.731
- I'd like to look somewhere
in Santa Monica maybe.

01:08:46.818 --> 01:08:48.341
I've got an addicted to running

01:08:48.428 --> 01:08:50.822
at the beach after
being at Bianca's.

01:08:50.908 --> 01:08:52.301
- Yeah, Bianca's...

01:08:55.305 --> 01:08:56.479
Here.

01:08:56.609 --> 01:08:58.046
- I'm so sorry to interrupt.

01:08:58.176 --> 01:09:01.832
I just, I couldn't
wait to give you this.

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:10.710
- Are you serious? Did you
get this back from him?

01:09:10.798 --> 01:09:12.322
- Well, not me,
my lawyer friend.

01:09:12.452 --> 01:09:13.671
I guess she went
over to his house

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:16.282
and he ended up
giving it to her.

01:09:16.368 --> 01:09:19.416
- That is incredible.
Thank you so much.

01:09:19.546 --> 01:09:22.941
- Of course. I know how much
it meant to you to get it back.

01:09:23.028 --> 01:09:24.943
So do you think that
we should call your mom

01:09:25.073 --> 01:09:26.684
to give her the good news?

01:09:26.770 --> 01:09:28.032
- Oh, I can do that later.

01:09:29.469 --> 01:09:30.731
- Oh, I just thought
it would put her mind

01:09:30.818 --> 01:09:32.298
at ease to do it now.

01:09:32.385 --> 01:09:34.212
- I'm pretty sure
that she and my dad

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.041
are out with their
friends anyway, so.

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:41.654
- Oh! Oh, the sushi looks good.

01:09:41.742 --> 01:09:42.308
Yeah.

01:09:42.439 --> 01:09:43.613
- Oh, is that yellowtail?

01:09:43.701 --> 01:09:45.702
- Yeah, it is.

01:09:45.790 --> 01:09:46.529
- It's my favorite.

01:09:46.617 --> 01:09:47.313
Mm.

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:56.888
- Well, I'm so sorry
to bother you two.

01:09:58.106 --> 01:09:59.282
- It's okay.

01:09:59.412 --> 01:10:01.022
- I guess I'll just grab
a burger on my way home.

01:10:01.153 --> 01:10:02.589
- Thank you for
bringing me this.

01:10:02.719 --> 01:10:04.287
Mm.

01:10:09.596 --> 01:10:10.335
- Is it just me, or
did she really want us

01:10:10.467 --> 01:10:11.859
to ask her to sit down?

01:10:11.946 --> 01:10:13.339
- Maybe we should have.

01:10:13.425 --> 01:10:15.385
I mean, she did come all this
way just to give me the ring.

01:10:15.472 --> 01:10:16.559
- I'm sure she's gonna find

01:10:16.690 --> 01:10:17.909
a delicious burger
somewhere else.

01:10:19.867 --> 01:10:20.912
That was really weird.

01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:22.827
- Yeah.

01:10:25.133 --> 01:10:25.873
- Cheers.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.744
- Cheers.

01:10:26.831 --> 01:10:27.484
- To a great night.

01:10:34.186 --> 01:10:34.925
There you go, madame.

01:10:35.056 --> 01:10:36.666
Thank you.

01:10:41.193 --> 01:10:43.239
- I had a really
nice time tonight.

01:10:43.326 --> 01:10:43.848
- So did I.

01:10:45.327 --> 01:10:46.416
- Can I take you out again?

01:10:46.503 --> 01:10:50.333
- Yes, but what if I
take you out this time?

01:10:50.463 --> 01:10:51.377
- Ooh.

01:10:52.335 --> 01:10:53.814
How about this?

01:10:53.901 --> 01:10:56.687
You can plan the date as long
as you allow me to still pay.

01:10:56.817 --> 01:10:58.732
- Careful. You don't
know what I have in mind.

01:11:00.343 --> 01:11:01.648
- Whatever it is, I can't wait.

01:11:03.868 --> 01:11:05.434
Goodnight, Angelina.

01:11:05.522 --> 01:11:06.349
- Goodnight.

01:11:28.022 --> 01:11:30.242
- Oh, hey. How'd it go?

01:11:30.373 --> 01:11:31.635
- He's incredible.

01:11:33.463 --> 01:11:35.813
Thank you again for
getting this back to me.

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:37.684
I really appreciate it.

01:11:37.771 --> 01:11:39.295
- So we're good now?

01:11:40.339 --> 01:11:41.384
- Yeah, we're good.

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:04.842
- You guys should
go salsa dancing.

01:12:04.929 --> 01:12:06.626
He said he used to teach it.

01:12:06.713 --> 01:12:09.934
- Really? That's
actually not a bad idea.

01:12:10.021 --> 01:12:11.196
- Oh, by the way,

01:12:11.282 --> 01:12:13.851
I found a really nice
two-bedroom in Malibu.

01:12:13.938 --> 01:12:16.288
It's small, but they've
completely redone it.

01:12:16.375 --> 01:12:18.943
- Malibu is kind of hard
for my work, though.

01:12:19.073 --> 01:12:20.205
- Why are you whispering?

01:12:20.335 --> 01:12:22.207
- Who knows what else
she planted in my room.

01:12:22.338 --> 01:12:23.295
I don't want her
to know I'm leaving

01:12:23.425 --> 01:12:25.079
until it's time to leave.

01:12:25.210 --> 01:12:26.385
The sooner the better.

01:12:26.472 --> 01:12:27.778
It's fine if it's small,

01:12:27.865 --> 01:12:31.172
I just think we should find a
place with two parking spots.

01:12:40.878 --> 01:12:43.228
Just send me the pics
and I'll take a look.

01:12:43.315 --> 01:12:44.925
- I will. Later, love.

01:12:45.012 --> 01:12:45.709
- Bye.

01:13:32.669 --> 01:13:33.539
- So are you a good dancer

01:13:33.626 --> 01:13:35.062
or am I gonna
totally show you up?

01:13:35.193 --> 01:13:38.022
- I'll have you know that I
took eight years of ballet.

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:41.547
- You can actually
do a spinny thing?

01:13:41.634 --> 01:13:43.941
- Are you talking
about a pirouette?

01:13:44.028 --> 01:13:47.161
- Possibly. The one on
the very tip of your toes.

01:13:47.291 --> 01:13:48.989
- Those are called pointe shoes,

01:13:49.076 --> 01:13:51.077
and yes, it is as
hard as it looks.

01:13:51.165 --> 01:13:51.862
- Ouch.

01:14:01.611 --> 01:14:02.307
What's wrong.

01:14:09.314 --> 01:14:11.577
This is getting out of control.

01:14:13.231 --> 01:14:14.232
Your, your roommate.

01:14:15.668 --> 01:14:16.626
- Hello, Bianca?

01:14:16.755 --> 01:14:17.757
- Angelina.

01:14:17.888 --> 01:14:18.932
- What's going on?

01:14:19.063 --> 01:14:21.282
- He's here. Marco's here.

01:14:21.369 --> 01:14:22.762
- What?

01:14:22.849 --> 01:14:24.068
- He was banging on the door
and I don't know where he went,

01:14:24.198 --> 01:14:26.766
but I think he might be
trying to get in around back.

01:14:26.897 --> 01:14:28.550
- Bianca, call the police.

01:14:28.638 --> 01:14:30.378
- I did. They're on their way.

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:31.989
- Marco is at Bianca's house.

01:14:32.119 --> 01:14:33.120
What?

01:14:33.207 --> 01:14:36.472
- Oh my god. I think
I hear him downstairs.

01:14:36.602 --> 01:14:38.474
- Get out of there. Bianca-

01:14:40.519 --> 01:14:42.129
Bianca. Bianca!

01:14:42.913 --> 01:14:43.827
He's inside.

01:14:43.914 --> 01:14:44.827
- Let's go.

01:14:44.958 --> 01:14:45.785
- But she already
called the cops.

01:14:45.916 --> 01:14:47.004
- All right, then.

01:14:47.091 --> 01:14:48.222
Marco better hope they
get there before I do.

01:14:48.309 --> 01:14:53.184
Let's go.

01:15:02.933 --> 01:15:05.196
- Marco's at Bianca's house.
He's trying to break in.

01:15:05.282 --> 01:15:07.677
- What? Where are you?

01:15:07.764 --> 01:15:09.505
- I'm with Diego. We,
we're going in right now.

01:15:09.592 --> 01:15:10.853
- Why? No!

01:15:10.941 --> 01:15:13.596
- Someone's gotta finish this
crap with Marco for good.

01:15:18.121 --> 01:15:19.471
- I have to go. We're here.

01:15:19.558 --> 01:15:20.559
Where are the cops?

01:15:20.646 --> 01:15:21.429
- What's the alarm code?

01:15:21.559 --> 01:15:22.952
- 22771.

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:23.693
- All right, stay here, okay?

01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:25.695
- Okay.

01:16:57.047 --> 01:16:58.614
Bianca.

01:16:58.701 --> 01:17:00.572
- Right behind you, sport.

01:17:14.717 --> 01:17:17.241
First Marco, and now you?

01:17:19.286 --> 01:17:21.985
She's my sister. You'll
never compete with that.

01:17:36.129 --> 01:17:37.304
Bianca?

01:17:37.391 --> 01:17:38.523
- Angelina?

01:17:43.397 --> 01:17:44.616
He's downstairs. Come on.

01:17:54.234 --> 01:17:54.539
- Where is Diego?

01:17:56.148 --> 01:17:56.933
- He's by the pool.

01:17:58.585 --> 01:17:59.500
Marco stabbed him.

01:17:59.587 --> 01:18:00.110
- What?

01:18:01.589 --> 01:18:02.678
- No, he'll kill us, too.

01:18:04.941 --> 01:18:06.550
God, where the
hell are the cops?

01:18:06.638 --> 01:18:07.465
Give me your phone.

01:18:12.862 --> 01:18:14.210
Yeah, this is Bianca Hernandez.

01:18:15.647 --> 01:18:17.605
Where are the police?

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:21.218
There's an intruder in my house,
and he just stabbed a man.

01:18:21.305 --> 01:18:22.393
No, that's the wrong address.

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:26.266
It's 829 Reese street, Reese.

01:18:26.397 --> 01:18:27.180
Hurry!

01:18:28.965 --> 01:18:29.487
It's okay.

01:18:30.835 --> 01:18:33.056
It's okay. I'll protect you.

01:18:33.143 --> 01:18:34.840
We're both gonna be okay.

01:18:34.971 --> 01:18:36.320
Okay.

01:19:02.302 --> 01:19:03.173
- Oh my God.

01:19:04.696 --> 01:19:06.263
- And when this is all over,

01:19:06.393 --> 01:19:08.308
we're gonna go far
away from here.

01:19:08.395 --> 01:19:10.963
We're gonna start our lives
over where no one can find us,

01:19:11.050 --> 01:19:12.138
okay.
- What?

01:19:12.269 --> 01:19:16.534
- It's okay. It'll just
be us together forever.

01:19:17.577 --> 01:19:20.320
- What are you talking about?

01:19:20.407 --> 01:19:22.322
- You know what
I'm talking about.

01:19:22.409 --> 01:19:26.022
I'll protect you. You never
have to be scared ever again.

01:19:26.109 --> 01:19:26.718
We need to help Di-

01:19:26.849 --> 01:19:28.851
- No! Let him die.

01:19:28.938 --> 01:19:29.939
- What?

01:19:30.068 --> 01:19:31.592
- You don't need him.
He doesn't love you.

01:19:31.723 --> 01:19:33.202
I'm the one who loves
you. We're blood!

01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:34.770
- What are you talking about?

01:19:35.945 --> 01:19:37.250
- I can't Let you leave again.

01:19:38.643 --> 01:19:40.471
I can't let you leave me behind.

01:19:43.082 --> 01:19:44.388
I miss you too much!

01:19:44.475 --> 01:19:45.302
- Get away from me.

01:19:47.478 --> 01:19:49.785
I'm not your sister,
Bianca. I'm not Amelia.

01:19:53.614 --> 01:19:54.877
- Well, we gotta
get you out of here.

01:19:54.964 --> 01:19:56.704
It wasn't Marco.

01:19:56.835 --> 01:19:58.489
It was Bianca.

01:19:58.619 --> 01:20:00.665
Call the cops and go
wait with Angelina.

01:20:00.752 --> 01:20:01.797
- Where's Angelina?

01:20:02.885 --> 01:20:03.929
- She's in my car.

01:20:04.016 --> 01:20:04.930
- No, she's not.

01:20:08.412 --> 01:20:09.065
- Why did you leave?

01:20:10.630 --> 01:20:12.546
We hated mom and
dad, and yet you left

01:20:12.677 --> 01:20:14.112
to be with them instead of me?

01:20:15.505 --> 01:20:16.289
- Get away from me.

01:20:18.378 --> 01:20:22.773
- Don't you love me after
everything I've done for you.

01:20:22.905 --> 01:20:23.557
- Let me get out of here.

01:20:23.688 --> 01:20:24.645
No!

01:20:31.217 --> 01:20:33.654
- Is that Marco's phone?

01:20:33.741 --> 01:20:35.526
Where did you? How did?

01:20:38.398 --> 01:20:43.012
- He's gone, Angelina. He's
at the bottom of the bay.

01:20:44.491 --> 01:20:45.318
He'll never bother
you ever again.

01:20:46.362 --> 01:20:47.190
- You mean? You!

01:20:48.931 --> 01:20:50.671
- I didn't want to kill him,

01:20:52.456 --> 01:20:54.153
but it was the only way I
could get the ring back.

01:20:55.415 --> 01:20:56.286
- Oh my god.

01:20:56.416 --> 01:20:58.114
No!

01:20:58.201 --> 01:20:58.941
No!

01:21:00.072 --> 01:21:00.856
- Go, go, go, go.

01:21:02.422 --> 01:21:03.119
- Here.

01:21:12.998 --> 01:21:13.607
- If we're gonna
leave this world,

01:21:13.737 --> 01:21:15.348
we're gonna leave it together.

01:21:15.434 --> 01:21:16.915
You're my Angelina.

01:21:29.145 --> 01:21:30.014
- Angelina!

01:21:41.374 --> 01:21:42.723
Stop!

01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:50.296
She doesn't
like you, Gaby.

01:21:50.383 --> 01:21:52.777
I'm the one she
wants to be with.

01:22:03.657 --> 01:22:05.398
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:22:05.529 --> 01:22:07.443
It's okay. Go help Diego.

01:22:08.662 --> 01:22:09.228
I'll be fine. Go!

01:22:17.584 --> 01:22:18.281
- Diego!

01:22:23.634 --> 01:22:24.764
Hello.

01:22:24.852 --> 01:22:26.202
Ma'am,
police are almost there,

01:22:26.332 --> 01:22:28.900
and an ambulance has been
dispatched to your location.

01:22:29.031 --> 01:22:30.641
- Thank god. I've got you.

01:22:57.450 --> 01:22:58.843
Another one for the kitchen.

01:23:00.671 --> 01:23:03.239
- You know, we should have
done this a long time ago.

01:23:03.326 --> 01:23:04.282
- Yeah.

01:23:13.814 --> 01:23:16.382
What are you doing here? I
thought you had meetings today.

01:23:16.513 --> 01:23:17.253
- I rescheduled.

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.259
It's so good seeing you.

01:23:23.389 --> 01:23:24.869
Plus, you know I wanted to
see your new neighborhood

01:23:24.956 --> 01:23:27.698
since I might be spending
some extra time here.

01:23:27.785 --> 01:23:28.786
- You just might be?

01:23:28.916 --> 01:23:30.396
- Yeah. So can I help you?

01:23:30.483 --> 01:23:31.615
- Yeah.

01:23:31.702 --> 01:23:33.269
- You lead and I
follow. How about that?

01:23:33.398 --> 01:23:36.489
Okay.
