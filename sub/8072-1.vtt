00:03.737 --> 00:06.974
[music playing]

00:08.109 --> 00:09.043
I told you.

00:09.143 --> 00:11.079
My mom's not here.

00:11.179 --> 00:12.313
He's not here, either.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.715
I'm all alone.

00:14.815 --> 00:17.751
(WHISPERING) And I don't know
anything about electric bills.

00:17.851 --> 00:21.755
I don't know anything
about electric bills.

00:21.855 --> 00:25.226
Do you know you're
five months behind?

00:25.326 --> 00:28.796
Hey, I'm just a little
kid, and you're scaring me.

00:28.896 --> 00:31.999
Hey, I'm just a little
kid, and you're scaring me.

00:32.100 --> 00:34.535
Oh, nice parenting, Mother.

00:34.635 --> 00:38.906
DJ's going to turn out more
screwed up than the rest of us.

00:39.006 --> 00:41.609
Yeah, well, by the time
the third one comes along,

00:41.709 --> 00:44.512
you should have the hang of it.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.947
They want to call Dad at work.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.149
No!

00:48.249 --> 00:49.217
Tell them he's not there.

00:49.317 --> 00:50.951
He's out trying to
find you a new kidney.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.589
Just say you don't
have the number.

00:55.689 --> 00:56.757
And hurry up.

00:56.857 --> 00:59.460
I'm waiting for
a call from Mark.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.162
I don't got the number, OK?

01:01.262 --> 01:02.996
Bye.

01:03.097 --> 01:06.500
Atta boy, Deej.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.468
Can I go now?

01:07.568 --> 01:08.402
In a minute.

01:08.502 --> 01:11.739
Um, I'm real sorry
I made you lie.

01:11.839 --> 01:14.508
You know I wouldn't
if I didn't have to.

01:14.608 --> 01:15.776
Yeah, I know.

01:15.876 --> 01:16.777
Because it's not cool to lie.

01:16.877 --> 01:17.845
You know that, right?

01:17.945 --> 01:19.980
I-- I've told you that before.

01:20.080 --> 01:26.019
It's just, well, sometimes we
have to lie in order to protect

01:26.120 --> 01:27.721
ourselves from all
the evil people

01:27.821 --> 01:30.491
out there who seek
to destroy us.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.392
Got it?

01:31.492 --> 01:32.293
Got it.

01:32.393 --> 01:34.328
Now can I go?

01:34.428 --> 01:36.597
Yeah.

01:36.697 --> 01:37.531
[phone ringing]

01:37.631 --> 01:38.499
Hey, hey, hey.

01:38.599 --> 01:39.567
You-- you better get that, DJ.

01:39.667 --> 01:43.637
It might be those evil
Easterseal people.

01:43.737 --> 01:44.805
Hello?

01:44.905 --> 01:45.706
Oh.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.175
Hi, Mark.

01:47.275 --> 01:48.309
Yeah, Becky's here.

01:48.409 --> 01:49.977
I'll go get her.

01:50.077 --> 01:52.846
Didn't I teach you anything?

01:52.946 --> 01:57.351
[theme music]

02:42.430 --> 02:43.764
It was nothing
like the boob job.

02:43.864 --> 02:46.834
They just sucked the
fat out with a vacuum.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.369
How much did they suck out?

02:48.469 --> 02:49.270
Some.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.971
A lot?

02:51.071 --> 02:52.340
Enough.

02:52.440 --> 02:55.576
Well, did they have
to change the bag?

02:55.676 --> 02:57.578
What is your point, Roseanne?

02:57.678 --> 02:58.779
It don't look no different.

02:58.879 --> 02:59.680
Well, sure.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.682
It's still swollen.

03:01.782 --> 03:02.783
God, Nancy.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.185
Why would you go torture
yourself like that?

03:05.286 --> 03:07.421
I was so depressed
when I got the separation

03:07.521 --> 03:09.156
papers from Arnie.

03:09.257 --> 03:12.893
I just had to do something to
make myself more desirable.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.228
Yeah.

03:14.328 --> 03:18.499
Guys just can't resist a chick
with a hemorrhoid pillow.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.468
Hey.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.969
Expecting a water
landing, Nance?

03:24.738 --> 03:26.006
That's it.

03:26.106 --> 03:27.341
I gotta go soak.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.009
Wait to go, Dan.

03:29.109 --> 03:32.079
She just had surgery because
of her low self-esteem.

03:32.179 --> 03:35.849
You walk in here and
kick her like a dog.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.651
Say something nice
about her butt, Dan.

03:40.354 --> 03:41.154
Very jaunty.

03:44.024 --> 03:44.892
Come on, Nancy.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.059
I'll drive you home.

03:46.159 --> 03:48.396
This time I won't go
over the railroad tracks.

03:48.496 --> 03:50.531
Oh, I keep misjudging it now.

03:53.434 --> 03:55.569
So how'd it go at the bank?

03:55.669 --> 03:57.338
Well, we chatted about
the recession for a while,

03:57.438 --> 03:58.806
don't you know.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.841
Then I gave them my "things
are bound to be better

04:00.941 --> 04:02.910
after the election" speech.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.077
Then they said,
"You're four months

04:04.177 --> 04:05.346
behind on your first
mortgage, three

04:05.446 --> 04:06.314
months behind on your second.

04:06.414 --> 04:07.281
We want our money by Friday.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.683
And here, have a calendar."

04:09.783 --> 04:11.151
Look.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.085
Kittens in a basket.

04:15.656 --> 04:19.860
Dan, I'm done with
that manifold back there.

04:19.960 --> 04:20.794
Hey.

04:20.894 --> 04:21.929
Hey, Mark.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.797
So uh, you want me to
come in again tomorrow?

04:23.897 --> 04:25.633
I don't think so, man.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.034
Well, can you give
me like a rough idea

04:27.134 --> 04:28.369
when you might need me again?

04:28.469 --> 04:32.440
Well, the way things are
going, here's your days off.

04:32.540 --> 04:34.308
That bad, huh?

04:34.408 --> 04:35.976
Look, things are
pretty rocky right now.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.945
Um, why don't we take this
on a day-to-day basis.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.012
OK.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.280
If you need me, you
know where to call.

04:40.381 --> 04:41.181
DAN: Thanks a lot, buddy.

04:44.552 --> 04:47.588
OK, Dan, so what
do we gotta do?

04:47.688 --> 04:48.789
They want their money, babe.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.624
Well, tell them
they can't have it.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.493
Can't we just give
them the truck?

04:52.593 --> 04:53.594
We hate the truck.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.262
Then what will
we live in, dear?

04:55.363 --> 04:56.597
[gasps]

04:56.697 --> 04:57.565
Oh, God, Dan.

04:57.665 --> 04:58.499
They don't want the house?

04:58.599 --> 04:59.767
No, they don't want the house.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.802
Well, that's a relief.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.504
No, they said they really
don't want the house,

05:03.604 --> 05:04.838
but they'll take it.

05:04.938 --> 05:07.140
Turns out it's worth less
than they loaded us for it.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.910
What kind of bank makes some
stupid investment like that?

05:10.010 --> 05:13.146
Hey, we're taking
our money elsewheres.

05:13.246 --> 05:16.617
That was their suggestion.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.285
Well, so now what?

05:18.386 --> 05:19.219
You pour the gasoline.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.888
I'll light the match.

05:20.988 --> 05:21.889
Damn.

05:21.989 --> 05:22.790
Yeah.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.892
Damn.

05:24.992 --> 05:28.095
I knew we shouldn't have
gone into business for ourself.

05:28.195 --> 05:29.363
There's nobody to steal from.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.172
Where's your sister?

05:39.272 --> 05:40.374
Upstairs.

05:40.474 --> 05:41.274
Becky!

05:41.375 --> 05:44.177
Get down here!

05:44.277 --> 05:45.145
What's going on?

05:45.245 --> 05:46.179
Family meeting, Deej.

05:46.279 --> 05:47.080
All right.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.181
I'm going.

05:48.281 --> 05:49.082
What's up?

05:49.182 --> 05:50.718
DAN: Pull up a chair, Beck.

05:50.818 --> 05:51.785
Oh, God.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.253
These are always bad news.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.755
What are you
worried about, Becky?

05:54.855 --> 05:59.026
How much worse can our lives
suck than they already do now?

05:59.126 --> 06:01.294
Well, it's taken
us a while, Darlene,

06:01.395 --> 06:05.799
but I think we've really
hit the jackpot this time.

06:05.899 --> 06:08.802
Your mother and I have
decided to close the bike shop.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.037
We're having a "going
out of business"

06:10.137 --> 06:13.574
sale and locking
the doors on Friday.

06:13.674 --> 06:16.343
And I don't have a job,
so that means no income.

06:16.444 --> 06:18.546
How'd we do?

06:18.646 --> 06:20.247
What are we going
to do for money?

06:20.347 --> 06:22.516
Well, I'm going to
go back to drywalling

06:22.616 --> 06:25.586
and maybe repair a couple
of bikes out of the garage.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.688
And uh, until things
pick up, it's going

06:27.788 --> 06:29.757
to be pretty tight around here.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.291
So it's just a real
good thing that we

06:31.391 --> 06:34.462
never gave you anything, or this
could come as a painful blow.

06:37.698 --> 06:38.866
Wait a second.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.701
What's going to happen to Mark?
- He's a good mechanic.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.402
He'll find something.

06:42.503 --> 06:45.973
You are going to help him
find another job, aren't you?

06:46.073 --> 06:48.075
I don't have a job.

06:48.175 --> 06:51.311
And your mother
doesn't have a job.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.548
But we'll make Mark
our first priority.

06:54.648 --> 06:55.683
How is he going
to pay the rent?

06:55.783 --> 06:57.551
He has an apartment.

06:57.651 --> 06:58.852
Looks like you're
back to making

06:58.952 --> 07:02.990
heel marks on the
ceiling of his car, Beck.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.758
Shut up, Dar.

07:04.858 --> 07:08.361
You know, Beck, I don't
know why, but I thought

07:08.462 --> 07:10.097
maybe the first words out
of your mouth might be,

07:10.197 --> 07:12.199
"Sorry you lost
your business, Dad.

07:12.299 --> 07:14.367
We know how much
it meant to you."

07:14.468 --> 07:16.036
I guess it's
going to sound a lot

07:16.136 --> 07:18.238
less since now when I say it.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.943
This is great.
This is just great.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.478
ROSEANNE: Hey--
DAN: Let it go.

07:24.578 --> 07:27.114
It ain't worth it.

07:27.214 --> 07:30.918
So do you have anything
that you want to say?

07:31.018 --> 07:32.219
Can I have a pony?

07:37.491 --> 07:38.291
Bye.

07:41.394 --> 07:42.295
Mom?

07:42.395 --> 07:43.430
Yeah?

07:43.531 --> 07:45.132
If you want it, I
still have some birthday

07:45.232 --> 07:47.601
money I hid in my closet.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.536
Aw.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.337
No you don't, but
thanks, anyway.

07:57.845 --> 07:58.846
I gotta go in.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.413
This isn't exactly the
time to miss curfew.

08:02.883 --> 08:03.684
Bye.

08:06.754 --> 08:08.789
I did get one job offer.

08:08.889 --> 08:09.690
You're kidding.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.424
Where?

08:11.525 --> 08:15.328
Rick called me today
from Minneapolis.

08:15.428 --> 08:16.396
Yeah?

08:16.496 --> 08:18.532
Well, there's an
opening where he works.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.233
The job's mine if I want it.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.172
Well, do you want it?

08:25.272 --> 08:26.940
Well, the pay's
three times what I made

08:27.040 --> 08:28.275
working for your dad, you know.

08:28.375 --> 08:29.276
They'd let me join the union.

08:29.376 --> 08:30.177
I'd be set.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.447
Why are you
telling me this now?

08:34.548 --> 08:36.917
We've been together
all afternoon.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.051
I don't know.

08:38.151 --> 08:39.252
I guess I just didn't
know how to tell you.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.755
You knew how to tell me.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.056
You just wanted to
get me to beg one

08:43.156 --> 08:44.457
last time before you dump me.

08:44.558 --> 08:45.458
What are you talking about?

08:45.559 --> 08:46.894
You just didn't
want me mad at you.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.328
Hey, you're always mad at me.

08:48.428 --> 08:51.498
That's never stopped us before.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.233
Besides, I'm not dumping you.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.435
Well, what do you call
moving to Minneapolis?

08:55.535 --> 08:57.137
It doesn't mean
we have to break up.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.038
Yeah?

08:58.138 --> 08:59.172
Well, think about it.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.507
I mean, you're
gonna be out there,

09:00.608 --> 09:01.842
partying with your friends.

09:01.942 --> 09:04.244
You're gonna meet somebody else.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.613
And I'm gonna be
stuck down here,

09:05.713 --> 09:07.180
spending my nights
watching "Bonanza"

09:07.280 --> 09:08.148
with Dan and Roseanne.

09:08.248 --> 09:10.083
No way!

09:10.183 --> 09:11.752
Hey, I didn't say
I was going to go.

09:14.722 --> 09:19.392
Look, if you don't want me to
take the job, I won't take it.

09:22.462 --> 09:24.331
I can't tell you what to do.

09:30.337 --> 09:31.238
Don't go.

09:36.744 --> 09:37.645
OK.

09:37.745 --> 09:40.113
Yeah, sure.

09:40.213 --> 09:43.250
I won't go.

09:43.350 --> 09:44.151
You mean it?

09:44.251 --> 09:46.153
You won't?

09:46.253 --> 09:47.454
I said so, didn't I?

09:47.554 --> 09:49.857
Oh, I love you so much.

09:55.195 --> 09:58.165
Settle, Mom.

09:58.265 --> 10:01.268
Look, I gotta go in.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.871
So what are you doing tomorrow?

10:03.971 --> 10:05.172
Guess I'm looking for a job.

10:07.808 --> 10:08.608
Well, I'll come with.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.614
Hey, everything's
gonna be great, OK?

10:20.287 --> 10:21.088
Bye.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.603
[music - "bonanza" theme]

10:42.209 --> 10:44.611
ROSEANNE: These cereal bowls
aren't gonna clean themselves,

10:44.712 --> 10:45.612
Darlene.

10:45.713 --> 10:47.114
Did you hear me?

10:47.214 --> 10:48.115
Darlene?

10:48.215 --> 10:50.617
Darlene!

10:50.718 --> 10:52.385
Mom wants you.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.855
Bite me.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.289
Uh-oh.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.959
Somebody needs a hug.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.328
Just go away, OK?

11:01.428 --> 11:02.329
What's wrong with you?

11:02.429 --> 11:03.230
Nothing.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.297
I'm just tired.

11:04.397 --> 11:05.332
DARLENE: No wonder.

11:05.432 --> 11:08.435
You were tossing and
turning all night.

11:08.535 --> 11:10.603
What, do you watch
me when I sleep?

11:10.704 --> 11:12.239
Yes, Becky.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.107
You fascinate me.

11:14.207 --> 11:18.178
You know, sometimes the
drool on your pillow,

11:18.278 --> 11:19.579
it isn't always yours.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.014
Ugh.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.249
God, I hate you.

11:22.349 --> 11:25.352
Just go to school.

11:25.452 --> 11:26.619
Aren't you gonna
give me a ride?

11:26.720 --> 11:27.921
I'm not going.

11:28.021 --> 11:31.759
You'll have to get to
detention by yourself today.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.593
You're cutting school?

11:33.693 --> 11:34.795
But you like high school, Becky.

11:34.895 --> 11:35.695
Remember?

11:35.796 --> 11:38.531
You're a geek.

11:38.631 --> 11:40.734
I'm helping Mark find a job.

11:40.834 --> 11:41.835
Oh, that's a great idea.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.270
I'll cut, too, and help
him find his shoes.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.408
I'm going along for
the support, Darlene.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.177
I don't know why
you even bother.

11:50.277 --> 11:53.213
It's not like anybody's going
to hire the Amazing Idiot Boy.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.581
Oh, yeah?

11:54.681 --> 11:56.583
Well, the Amazing
Idiot Boy got offered

11:56.683 --> 11:58.886
a great job in Minneapolis.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.954
Well, then why's
he still looking?

12:01.054 --> 12:04.792
Because he decided to find
something around Lanford.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.760
Wait a minute.

12:06.860 --> 12:10.363
You mean he had a chance to get
out of this hole and he's not?

12:10.463 --> 12:13.600
God, he just made king
of the idiot boys.

12:13.700 --> 12:16.203
He's doing it for me, OK?

12:16.303 --> 12:19.940
He said he'd stay if I wanted
him to, and I said stay.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.508
Good boy, Mark.

12:21.608 --> 12:24.611
Hey, maybe now you can train him
not to drink out of the toilet.

12:24.711 --> 12:25.712
I didn't force him.

12:25.813 --> 12:26.914
He asked me.

12:27.014 --> 12:27.948
Hey, relax, Becky.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.049
It's not like I care.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.018
God, why in the
hell do I talk to you?

12:31.118 --> 12:32.619
You know, I know what I'm doing.

12:32.719 --> 12:33.686
Oh, sure.

12:33.787 --> 12:35.055
I mean, actually you're
doing him a favor

12:35.155 --> 12:36.556
by keeping him here.

12:36.656 --> 12:39.526
Now when he fulfills his
destiny as a big, fat loser,

12:39.626 --> 12:40.693
he'll have someone to blame.

12:48.368 --> 12:49.636
Listen to this.

12:49.736 --> 12:53.106
"Mavis McGowan, 64, beloved
wife of Arthur, sister of Helen,

12:53.206 --> 12:55.408
of a heart attack
Tuesday morning.

12:55.508 --> 12:58.912
Cherished longtime receptionist
at the Lanford Clinic."

12:59.012 --> 13:01.381
Oh, that's too bad.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.150
I couldn't be a receptionist.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.285
You gotta know how to type.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.386
Read me another one.

13:06.486 --> 13:07.720
I can't believe we
didn't find anything.

13:07.821 --> 13:12.259
I mean, 11 people with perfectly
good jobs died last week.

13:12.359 --> 13:14.862
Well, I'm not
qualified for those jobs.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.897
Didn't somebody get their
head caught in an Orange

13:16.997 --> 13:18.932
Julius machine or something?

13:19.032 --> 13:19.833
Hang in there.

13:19.933 --> 13:20.800
We'll keep looking.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.602
Oh, there's nothing
to choose from.

13:22.702 --> 13:24.838
It's too bad there's not
a holiday weekend coming up.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.279
Roseanne, there's a
printing company moving

13:32.379 --> 13:33.981
into the old Wellman Plant.

13:34.081 --> 13:34.882
So?

13:34.982 --> 13:35.849
So listen to this.

13:35.949 --> 13:36.950
"No experience required.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.085
No references needed.

13:38.185 --> 13:39.652
No training necessary."

13:39.752 --> 13:40.553
Wow!

13:40.653 --> 13:41.454
Hooray!

13:41.554 --> 13:43.423
At last, a crappy job.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.858
When's the interview?

13:44.958 --> 13:45.758
This morning at 10:00.

13:45.859 --> 13:47.127
Oh.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.096
Well, I can't go because I told
Dan I'd be down at the shop.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.230
You know, it's the last day.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.232
Oh, well, you can be
a little late for that.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.301
Or I'll cover for you.

13:54.401 --> 13:55.936
I swear I'll sell my butt off.

13:56.036 --> 13:58.038
Well, maybe the interview
wouldn't take that long.

13:58.138 --> 13:58.939
Yeah, come on.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.507
Let me do it for you.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.342
Please let me do it for you.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.743
God, is this what
you're like on a date?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.216
Well, I'm gone.

14:09.316 --> 14:12.052
Isn't Becky driving
you to school?

14:12.152 --> 14:13.586
No, not today.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.055
Why not?

14:15.155 --> 14:15.989
She has some stuff to do.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.424
It's no biggie.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.459
But she is going
to school, right?

14:19.559 --> 14:22.029
Well, of course she is.

14:22.129 --> 14:23.897
Yeah.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.865
I want you to look
into my eyes and tell

14:25.966 --> 14:27.167
me that you're not lying.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.269
Mom, that only works on DJ.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.570
Then you have
nothing to worry about.

14:34.107 --> 14:37.144
I'm not lying.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.045
Mhm.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.916
Well, I know everything
I need to know.

14:43.016 --> 14:43.816
You can go.

14:48.088 --> 14:48.989
Was she lying?

14:49.089 --> 14:49.889
I don't know.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.325
It only works on DJ.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.294
Becky, get down here!

14:54.394 --> 14:55.295
No, Roseanne.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.696
You gotta get to the interview.

14:56.796 --> 14:57.830
You don't have time for a fight.

14:57.931 --> 14:58.898
It's not a fight.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.701
It's-- it's an ambush.

15:01.801 --> 15:02.669
Morning, everybody.

15:02.769 --> 15:05.438
Great day to go
belly-up, isn't it?

15:05.538 --> 15:07.840
Boy, you're in good spirits.

15:07.941 --> 15:09.809
Well, you know, it just feels
like one of those days that

15:09.909 --> 15:12.012
starts off with a
hearty breakfast

15:12.112 --> 15:14.681
and as with some guy on the
news saying, "Before turning

15:14.781 --> 15:16.416
the gun on himself."

15:16.516 --> 15:18.285
So now I have to
make you breakfast?

15:18.385 --> 15:22.155
Honey, I won't have
the strength to reload.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.156
All right.
Sit down.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.191
I'll get you something.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.159
Well, better make
it quick, Roseanne.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.127
Gotta get going.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.028
Going where?

15:28.128 --> 15:30.330
Well, I got a job interview.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.299
Honey today's the
last day at the shop.

15:32.399 --> 15:33.433
I need you to help out.

15:33.533 --> 15:36.569
Well, I know that, but
Jackie will be there.

15:36.669 --> 15:37.737
Yeah, but you
know the inventory.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.372
She doesn't know what goes.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.808
Well, I'll fit her in, OK?

15:41.908 --> 15:42.809
Everything goes.
- Got it.

15:42.909 --> 15:43.910
OK.

15:44.011 --> 15:45.145
I'm going to go home
and change my clothes,

15:45.245 --> 15:47.280
and I'll meet you
down at the shop.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.282
Roseanne, this is gonna be
a really tough day for me.

15:49.382 --> 15:50.550
I need you down there.

15:50.650 --> 15:51.718
Can't you do this tomorrow?

15:51.818 --> 15:53.820
Well, the job might
not be there tomorrow.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.755
Well, I sure as hell
know the shop won't.

15:55.855 --> 15:56.956
Well, Dan, come on.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.391
What are we talking
about, an hour?

15:58.491 --> 15:59.759
For crying out loud.

15:59.859 --> 16:01.028
I gotta get a job, don't I?

16:01.128 --> 16:02.595
Isn't that part
of the plan here?

16:02.695 --> 16:03.997
You're acting like I'm
cutting out on you.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.299
It's not like I'm trying to
ditch school or anything.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.103
Jeez.

16:10.203 --> 16:11.704
I'm gonna kill Darlene.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.373
And then as soon as
you do that, you are

16:13.473 --> 16:14.974
going to go to school, right?

16:15.075 --> 16:15.942
I can't.

16:16.043 --> 16:17.777
I'll be with Mark.

16:17.877 --> 16:18.711
Man.

16:18.811 --> 16:19.912
I don't know about
you, Roseanne,

16:20.013 --> 16:21.848
but I'm sure tired of
hearing about Mark.

16:21.948 --> 16:23.016
I'd like to hear
a little bit more

16:23.116 --> 16:24.551
about how Becky's
going to school today.

16:24.651 --> 16:25.752
Well, she's not.

16:25.852 --> 16:26.953
I don't have time
for this, Becky.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.488
You gotta go to school.
- You don't understand.

16:28.588 --> 16:29.589
I don't have to understand.

16:29.689 --> 16:30.857
Just go!

16:30.957 --> 16:32.092
Oh, Dan.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.327
You're mad at me and you're
taking it out on Becky.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.228
Keep going.

16:39.266 --> 16:41.334
You know, you act like
you're the only ones

16:41.434 --> 16:43.036
with problems around here.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.705
Boy.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.740
You are the most
selfish piece of work

16:47.840 --> 16:49.342
I have ever seen in my life.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.211
Do you have any idea
what we're going through?

16:51.311 --> 16:54.013
Do you have any idea
what I'm going through?

16:54.114 --> 16:55.715
I mean, today may
be the last day

16:55.815 --> 16:56.749
I'll ever see Mark again, OK?

16:56.849 --> 16:57.650
Whoa.

16:57.750 --> 16:58.618
What are you talking about?

16:58.718 --> 17:00.920
He got a job offer
in Minneapolis.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.123
And I'm telling him to take it.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.891
And it's all because of you.

17:04.991 --> 17:05.825
Excuse me?

17:05.925 --> 17:07.127
If you knew how
to run a business,

17:07.227 --> 17:10.397
he'd still have a job, and
he wouldn't be leaving.

17:10.497 --> 17:11.498
Now I don't have Mark.

17:11.598 --> 17:12.399
I don't have college.

17:12.499 --> 17:13.400
I don't have anything!

17:13.500 --> 17:14.367
You blew it, Dad!

17:14.467 --> 17:16.503
You blew it for
everyone in this family.

17:16.603 --> 17:17.537
Becky, you shut up.

17:17.637 --> 17:18.505
Come on, Mother!

17:18.605 --> 17:20.307
You know it.

17:20.407 --> 17:21.408
Everybody knows it.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.042
I'm the only one with
the guts to say it.

17:26.113 --> 17:27.514
[door slams]

17:31.551 --> 17:35.355
That is not true, Dan.

17:35.455 --> 17:36.923
I would have the guts to say it.

17:42.762 --> 17:43.663
CUSTOMER: Look, pal.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.165
You're closing up
the place, right?

17:45.265 --> 17:46.099
All right.

17:46.199 --> 17:47.634
Now, do you think
anybody is going

17:47.734 --> 17:49.102
to walk in here in
the next few hours

17:49.202 --> 17:50.937
and offer you this much
cash for that bike?

17:51.037 --> 17:53.906
- Nobody with your boyish charm.
- All right.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.142
I'll tell you what.

17:55.242 --> 17:59.312
2,250 for your pride.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.614
Sold.

18:01.714 --> 18:02.515
Hey, Dan.

18:02.615 --> 18:03.416
Hey, Gil.

18:03.516 --> 18:04.384
How you doing, buddy?

18:04.484 --> 18:05.718
Oh, worst day of my life.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.987
Thanks.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.922
We all feel pretty bad about
what you're going through.

18:10.022 --> 18:13.993
Just want you to let us know
if there's anything we can do.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.528
Hey, you know that
guy that just left here?

18:15.628 --> 18:17.197
He's getting on
his bike right now?

18:17.297 --> 18:20.833
His registration
is way past due.

18:20.933 --> 18:21.701
Yeah?

18:21.801 --> 18:23.336
You want lights and sirens?

18:23.436 --> 18:24.937
How about something
in a hail of gunfire?

18:27.740 --> 18:29.041
Hey, Rosanne!

18:29.142 --> 18:30.310
Tell me you're employed.

18:30.410 --> 18:31.644
Hey, Jackie!

18:31.744 --> 18:33.313
Tell me you're married.

18:33.413 --> 18:34.981
Oh, no.

18:35.081 --> 18:36.349
What happened?

18:36.449 --> 18:39.886
What happened was that 400
people showed up for six jobs,

18:39.986 --> 18:42.822
so I'm standing there for
three hours, drinking coffee,

18:42.922 --> 18:47.026
just so some punk kid can ask
me if I have any special skills.

18:47.126 --> 18:50.062
I told him, "Yeah,
bladder control."

18:50.163 --> 18:51.298
Hi, Crystal.

18:51.398 --> 18:52.232
Hey.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.066
[baby talk]

18:55.735 --> 18:57.570
They just love
their new fork braces.

18:57.670 --> 18:58.471
Yeah.

18:58.571 --> 18:59.806
Well, they're at that age.

19:03.176 --> 19:04.844
So how's it going around here?

19:04.944 --> 19:06.913
Well, we are about
about out of business.

19:07.013 --> 19:09.282
So it's a success?

19:09.382 --> 19:11.184
How's Dan taking it?

19:11.284 --> 19:13.320
Like a man.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.988
That bad, huh?

19:16.088 --> 19:19.559
[imitating engine noises]

19:22.629 --> 19:24.797
Aw, come on, Dan.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.769
Biggest day in history of
the shop, and the best I can do

19:29.869 --> 19:30.670
is not lose my house.

19:30.770 --> 19:31.571
Ha.

19:31.671 --> 19:32.672
The '90s.

19:32.772 --> 19:35.408
Who knew?

19:35.508 --> 19:36.609
This was my one shot.

19:36.709 --> 19:39.779
Oh, you don't know that.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.414
Rose, this sucks.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.750
Nothing you could say is
going to make it any better.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.718
Oh, you just wanna
wallow for a while?

19:45.818 --> 19:46.819
Yes.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.054
OK.

19:48.154 --> 19:51.291
Well, then when you're done
wallowing, we'll go home

19:51.391 --> 19:53.326
and, um, well, I'll light
some candles, you know.

19:53.426 --> 19:54.727
I'll put on some soft music.

19:54.827 --> 19:55.662
Then we'll slip into bed.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.364
And I'll rub your feet.

19:57.464 --> 19:59.031
And I'll rub your back.

19:59.131 --> 20:01.634
Then, you know.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.202
Or we could go to
Lobo and get drunk.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.604
Oh!
OK!

20:04.704 --> 20:06.939
[phone ringing]

20:09.842 --> 20:11.844
Lanford Cycle.

20:11.944 --> 20:14.547
Yeah, I'll accept the charges.

20:14.647 --> 20:16.383
Becky, where are you?

20:16.483 --> 20:17.284
Minnesota?

20:17.384 --> 20:18.418
What's she doing in Minnesota?

20:18.518 --> 20:19.519
What's going on?

20:19.619 --> 20:20.587
Well, what the hell
are you talking about?

20:20.687 --> 20:21.788
What do you mean
you got married?

20:21.888 --> 20:23.290
Give me that phone.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.725
Becky!

20:25.825 --> 20:26.726
Ugh.

20:26.826 --> 20:29.396
Mom.

20:29.496 --> 20:30.363
Mom, come on.

20:38.338 --> 20:42.275
So uh, how'd it go?

20:42.375 --> 20:44.110
OK.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.077
Better than I expected.

21:01.394 --> 21:02.261
ROSEANNE (ON PHONE): Becky!

21:02.362 --> 21:03.563
Becky!

21:03.663 --> 21:05.965
Is this some kind of joke?
'Cause if you're not really

21:06.065 --> 21:07.199
married, I'm gonna kill you.

21:07.300 --> 21:11.838
And if you are really
married, I'm gonna kill you.

21:11.938 --> 21:12.805
Becky!

21:12.905 --> 21:13.706
Becky!

21:16.843 --> 21:20.146
Becky, this is the stupidest
thing you've ever done.

21:20.246 --> 21:21.848
You get your butt
back here right now.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.983
Do you hear me?

21:24.083 --> 21:25.217
OK.
OK.

21:25.318 --> 21:26.453
OK.

21:26.553 --> 21:29.722
What I meant was, it's
not too late to come home.

21:29.822 --> 21:30.823
We aren't mad at you.

21:30.923 --> 21:31.958
We just wanna know you're safe.

21:36.929 --> 21:38.831
Becky, are you listening?

21:38.931 --> 21:39.899
Talk to me.
Becky!

21:39.999 --> 21:40.800
I know you're there.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.269
I can hear you breathing.
