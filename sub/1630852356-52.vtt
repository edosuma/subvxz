WEBVTT

00:01.632 --> 00:03.634
Well, that's the last of 'em.

00:03.678 --> 00:06.419
Thanks for handling these
produce box deliveries, kids.

00:06.463 --> 00:07.638
There is...

00:07.943 --> 00:10.075
nothing more satisfying
for a farmer than seeing

00:10.119 --> 00:12.208
folks enjoy
the fruits of their labor,

00:12.251 --> 00:14.427
but I got a broken
ol' oven to tend to.

00:14.471 --> 00:16.647
Bill, it's gettin' worse!

00:16.691 --> 00:18.736
Ma, I told you
to get outta there!

00:18.780 --> 00:22.218
I live in this house,
I die in this house.

00:23.001 --> 00:25.177
All right, Ma,
I'm comin' to get ya...

00:25.221 --> 00:27.484
- Bye!
- Have fun in the smoke, Papa!

00:27.528 --> 00:30.400
Wow, Cricket, we sure got a lot
of vegetable deliveries.

00:30.443 --> 00:32.707
Reminds you how many people
live in Big City.

00:32.750 --> 00:35.057
Yeah, I bet there's
at least 37, 38...

00:35.100 --> 00:38.669
Actually, it's 3,205,416.

00:38.713 --> 00:40.062
Oh, I was real close!

00:40.105 --> 00:43.065
To think, so many people,
so many stories,

00:43.108 --> 00:45.807
all intertwined,
like a bowl of spaghetti.

00:45.850 --> 00:47.722
"Spaghetti"?
What are you talkin' about?

00:47.765 --> 00:49.419
We're all connected, Cricket!

00:49.462 --> 00:52.074
Our lives twist
and weave together.

00:52.117 --> 00:54.424
Even the smallest action
of one little spaghet

00:54.467 --> 00:56.774
-affects the entire bowl!

00:56.818 --> 00:58.559
Ah, that's crazy talk, Tilly!

00:58.602 --> 01:00.735
There's no way
we're all "intertwined".

01:00.778 --> 01:02.258
Stuff just happens.

01:02.301 --> 01:03.821
You'll see soon enough,
little brother.

01:05.914 --> 01:07.176
Hey, little neighbors!

01:07.219 --> 01:09.265
Whoa, Brett, your place
is a pig sty!

01:09.308 --> 01:10.527
I love it so much.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.964
Actually, pig stys
are much cleaner.

01:13.008 --> 01:15.706
Brett, you may want to consider
cleaning up a bit.

01:15.750 --> 01:17.795
Uh-oh, Tilly,
aren't you concerned

01:17.839 --> 01:20.058
that such a simple request
could set off

01:20.102 --> 01:22.800
a chain reaction
of events throughout the city?

01:22.844 --> 01:24.541
- Huh?
- She thinks all of Big City

01:24.585 --> 01:27.370
is intertwined like
a bowl of spaghetti!

01:27.413 --> 01:30.025
Oh. So you wanna help me
clean my apartment?

01:30.068 --> 01:32.593
No, Brett! We got vegetables
to deliver! Jeez!

01:33.332 --> 01:36.466
Well, I suppose this place
could use a li'l sprucin' up!

01:36.509 --> 01:38.903
But, if I put away
this coffee mug,

01:38.947 --> 01:40.731
you see the oil stain
underneath.

01:40.775 --> 01:41.863
Better leave it be.

01:41.906 --> 01:43.168
If I took out that garbage,

01:43.212 --> 01:44.866
those flies would have
nothing to eat!

01:44.909 --> 01:46.476
I ain't that cruel. Hmm?

01:50.306 --> 01:52.525
Nope! I couldn't do those dishes

01:52.569 --> 01:55.050
'cause that mold
is practically alive,

01:55.093 --> 01:56.617
and who am I to get in its way?

01:56.660 --> 01:58.183
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

01:58.227 --> 01:59.663
Well, great job cleaning, me!

01:59.707 --> 02:01.926
It was a lot of hard work,
but it was worth it!

02:02.405 --> 02:07.105
Huh? Ahhh!
Get it off! Get it off!

02:07.149 --> 02:10.326
Ugh, these neighbors.
Causing such a racket!

02:10.369 --> 02:12.023
Hey! Stupid adult!

02:12.067 --> 02:13.546
Stop the distress, eh?!

02:13.590 --> 02:15.461
You're disturbing
my peace and quie-

02:15.505 --> 02:17.028
Yeowww!

02:17.072 --> 02:19.291
Ouch, ouch, ouch! Whoa!

02:21.076 --> 02:23.861
Anoush! It appears
I am stuck.

02:23.905 --> 02:26.255
Fortunately, you can free me.

02:26.298 --> 02:28.779
All you have to do
is place your paw

02:28.823 --> 02:31.739
upon the little lever
and give a gentle push

02:31.782 --> 02:34.263
Whoa!
Too much, Anoush.

02:34.306 --> 02:36.308
No, Anoush.

02:36.352 --> 02:39.790
How, Anoush?

02:41.096 --> 02:44.142
Huh?
Thank you, Anoush.

02:44.186 --> 02:47.755
Now, I think I've earned
a little snack!

02:47.798 --> 02:49.757
Aah...

02:54.849 --> 02:57.242
<i>This is Channel Eleven,
with urgent squirrel news!</i>

02:57.286 --> 02:59.462
Maria Media here,
live at Big City Park!

02:59.505 --> 03:01.943
We have shocking, first-hand
reports that there is a squirrel

03:01.986 --> 03:03.814
with its head stuck in a jar!

03:03.858 --> 03:05.860
Sensitive viewers be advised.

03:06.512 --> 03:07.731
There you have it.

03:07.775 --> 03:09.295
Today, jars are
coming after squirrels.

03:09.515 --> 03:12.257
- But tomorrow?
- They'll be coming
after your children!

03:12.301 --> 03:14.695
This reporter thinks
it's time... to fight back.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.480
And... we're out.

03:17.523 --> 03:19.003
That'll bring in the viewers.

03:20.526 --> 03:22.069
Hey... do you ever thinkit might be,
y'know,

03:22.093 --> 03:24.748
wrong to play uppeople's fears for ratings?

03:24.792 --> 03:27.055
What's the worstthat could happen?

03:27.098 --> 03:29.100
Only a dum-dumwould actually be worried

03:29.144 --> 03:30.406
about something like this!

03:31.929 --> 03:33.714
<i>Today, jars are coming
after squirrels.</i>

03:33.757 --> 03:36.281
<i>But tomorrow, they'll be
coming after your children!</i>

03:36.325 --> 03:38.936
Oh, no! I'm like a children!

03:38.980 --> 03:41.678
I need to get somewhere
where no jars can get me.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.375
Ooh! There's the one!

03:43.419 --> 03:46.117
Zippity zurrity,
get me security!

03:46.161 --> 03:47.597
Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup...

03:47.640 --> 03:48.990
Mr. Mayor,
what's scaring you?

03:49.033 --> 03:51.775
I don't even remember anymore!

03:51.819 --> 03:53.659
Swaddle this man and get him
to the safe house!

04:01.045 --> 04:03.831
Hm. If those fools
don't quiet down,

04:03.874 --> 04:06.921
Master Remy won't be able
to enjoy his nap.

04:06.964 --> 04:09.750
-Sleep well, Master Remy.

04:10.446 --> 04:14.667
Hm. I know you're there...
Viper Fang.

04:14.711 --> 04:17.670
Couldn't run forever...
right, Tiger Fang?

04:17.714 --> 04:21.413
I don't go by that name anymore.
They call me Vasquez here.

04:21.457 --> 04:23.328
Well, how nice for you.

04:23.372 --> 04:25.896
Playing house with
a cute little family!

04:25.940 --> 04:27.860
But ever since you left us,
the Order of the Fang

04:27.898 --> 04:29.465
has been in shambles!

04:29.508 --> 04:31.510
The Order is no longer
my concern.

04:31.554 --> 04:33.817
I protect the boy now.
You must leave.

04:33.861 --> 04:35.471
It's his nap time.

04:35.514 --> 04:37.603
Heh. Oh, old friend...

04:37.647 --> 04:39.040
I'm not going anywhere.

04:39.083 --> 04:40.258
-Ahh!

04:41.042 --> 04:43.218
-Ha! You're rusty.

04:49.528 --> 04:51.879
You haven't seen the last of me!

04:51.922 --> 04:53.445
What happened to us, Viper?

04:53.489 --> 04:56.100
What a refreshing nap!

04:56.144 --> 04:58.015
Ready for our
spaghetti dinner, Vasquez?

04:58.059 --> 04:59.364
Very good, sir.

05:00.061 --> 05:01.149
<i>I still think your</i>

05:01.192 --> 05:02.977
Spaghetti Theory
is crazy, Tilly.

05:03.020 --> 05:04.868
No offense, but you're nuts
and I don't believe a word

05:04.892 --> 05:06.676
that comes out of your mouth.
No offense.

05:06.719 --> 05:09.505
Brother, everyone in this city
is intertwined!

05:09.548 --> 05:12.203
We all affect each other
whether we know it or not.

05:12.247 --> 05:15.293
Hello, spiritual
and actual neighbor.

05:15.337 --> 05:16.904
Your vegetable delivery
has arrived...

05:16.947 --> 05:17.948
Great. Thanks. Ciao.

05:18.557 --> 05:20.690
<i>Tonight on Alexander Kitchen...</i>

05:20.733 --> 05:21.813
I'm thinking, "Oh, my gosh,

05:22.126 --> 05:23.475
<i>I have to do
something with this.</i>

05:23.867 --> 05:26.000
<i>The judges are</i> screaming <i>
at me to hurry up,</i>

05:26.043 --> 05:27.392
<i>I can barely hear myself think.</i>

05:27.436 --> 05:28.872
<i>I have to julienne the carrots,</i>

05:28.916 --> 05:30.874
<i>chop the onions in triplicate,</i>

05:30.918 --> 05:32.745
and <i>start my ganache!</i>

05:32.789 --> 05:34.878
I am <i>at</i> my breaking point.

05:34.922 --> 05:36.619
<i>But</i> that's <i>when I realize,</i>

05:36.662 --> 05:39.491
<i>I forgot to add the boullion
to the stew!</i>

05:41.711 --> 05:43.800
<i>I have to think fast
if I'm going to pull this off.</i>

05:44.192 --> 05:46.977
<i>The clock's ticking down...
The judges are breathing
down my neck!</i>

05:47.021 --> 05:48.674
<i>My body starts
moving on its own...</i>

05:48.718 --> 05:49.806
<i>The world becomes a blur,</i>

05:50.285 --> 05:51.885
<i>and I just start grabbing
whatever I can,</i>

05:52.113 --> 05:54.680
<i>wondering when this
waking nightmare will end!</i>

05:54.724 --> 05:56.421
And then... it does.

05:56.465 --> 05:57.858
It's dinner time.

05:58.597 --> 06:00.991
- Good evening, Judge Terry.
- I hope you've come hungry.

06:03.037 --> 06:05.169
-For dinner tonight,
-I have prepared

06:05.213 --> 06:07.041
a broiled vegetable-herb salad,

06:07.084 --> 06:08.956
a charcoal enriched tartare,

06:08.999 --> 06:10.653
and a volcanic-salt sundae.

06:11.915 --> 06:13.090
What do you think?

06:13.482 --> 06:15.440
My heart is <i>pounding!</i>

06:23.318 --> 06:25.015
Oh, what a relief!

06:25.059 --> 06:27.017
This stuff looks disgusting!

06:27.061 --> 06:28.192
Who'd want to eat this?

06:28.236 --> 06:29.367
Let's just order in.

06:31.108 --> 06:32.936
So if we're all spaghetti,

06:32.980 --> 06:34.260
Oh, hey Gloria, phone's buzzin'.

06:34.285 --> 06:35.808
Then who are the meatballs?

06:35.852 --> 06:37.419
Hm. Looks like
I've gotta deliver

06:37.462 --> 06:39.116
a dinner order for Alexander.

06:39.160 --> 06:42.903
Another day at
my boring new delivery job.

06:42.946 --> 06:44.861
Woe is me!

06:45.340 --> 06:48.473
Hi, I'm here from MeHungry
to pick up an order from this...

06:48.517 --> 06:50.258
Swiss fondue restaurant?

06:50.301 --> 06:51.999
Seems a little over the top.

06:52.042 --> 06:53.324
I don't know what
you're talking about!

06:53.348 --> 06:55.698
This is a perfectly
normal restaurant.

06:55.741 --> 06:58.005
-Oh, I, uh,
-Now you must be swift!

06:58.266 --> 07:00.833
The cheese only stays melted
for a few minutes!

07:00.877 --> 07:04.707
Ha ha, yeah. Or else the fondue
becomes a fon-don't, huh?

07:04.750 --> 07:06.056
Is my life a joke to you?!

07:06.100 --> 07:07.753
I'm so sorry, I thought
you would laugh!

07:07.797 --> 07:09.059
-Go!

07:09.103 --> 07:12.062
421 Grand Avenue,
421 Grand Avenue...

07:12.106 --> 07:13.672
Should be just
a few blocks north.

07:13.716 --> 07:14.717
Uh-oh.

07:15.805 --> 07:17.154
Nice.

07:17.198 --> 07:19.852
-Incoming!

07:19.896 --> 07:21.265
Dang it, it's already been
a minute!

07:21.289 --> 07:22.609
I'm gonna need to
take a shortcut.

07:29.819 --> 07:31.647
Barrels, here!
Get your barrels here!

07:31.690 --> 07:33.475
Before I throw them
off this ledge!

07:33.518 --> 07:35.085
That was close.

07:35.129 --> 07:36.913
There it is! Huh?

07:36.957 --> 07:38.741
Nice and slow, everybody!

07:38.784 --> 07:41.962
Oh, no. <i>
I'm sorry...</i>

07:42.875 --> 07:45.617
<i>What's that now?</i>

07:48.011 --> 07:50.231
-Delivery!

07:51.275 --> 07:54.017
I didn't order any bucket
of watery cheese!

07:54.061 --> 07:56.019
This isn't 421 Grand Avenue?

07:56.063 --> 07:59.762
No. This is <i>clearly
421 Grand AAvenue!</i>

07:59.805 --> 08:02.199
Except the second Ais really small!

08:02.243 --> 08:03.722
I might not have ordered this,

08:03.766 --> 08:05.768
but I'm still going to
leave a review!

08:05.811 --> 08:08.118
And it's going to be scathing!

08:08.162 --> 08:11.382
Well, maybe
we can still get you home.

08:14.429 --> 08:16.344
Yup. This checks out.

08:17.954 --> 08:19.521
I quit.

08:21.566 --> 08:24.047
Hot dogs!
Get yer hot dogs!

08:24.091 --> 08:26.484
Hey! My hot dogs!

08:26.528 --> 08:29.748
Now they'll never know
the joy of being eaten!

08:29.792 --> 08:32.055
I mean, not to keep goin' back
to that Spaghetti Theory.

08:32.099 --> 08:33.752
But maybe we're
more like a ramen?

08:33.796 --> 08:36.016
the air is the soup

08:36.059 --> 08:39.367
-Cricket, what's that?-You mean
that thing barrelingstraight towards us?

08:40.020 --> 08:42.500
- Ah. Rogue hot dog cart.
- Ah.

08:46.809 --> 08:49.290
I can't believe you switched
our names on the new bench ad!

08:49.333 --> 08:50.726
We're not "Dawn and Don"!

08:50.769 --> 08:52.162
We're "Don and Dawn"!

08:52.206 --> 08:54.338
Dawn and Don just sounds better!

08:54.382 --> 08:56.036
Don and Dawn is just
kind of a mouthful.

08:56.079 --> 08:59.822
Well, maybe it's time forDon
and Dawn to just be Don!

08:59.865 --> 09:01.128
Done and done!

09:01.171 --> 09:02.694
-Ahh!

09:02.738 --> 09:04.087
- Oh, Dawn!
- Oh, Don!

09:04.131 --> 09:06.220
Our love is all that matters!

09:06.263 --> 09:08.657
Our love is all that matters,
Bella.

09:08.700 --> 09:11.834
Will you make me the happiest
man in the world and marry me?

09:11.877 --> 09:14.054
Oh, Bash! Yes, yes!

09:14.097 --> 09:15.968
She said yes, everybody!

09:16.012 --> 09:17.970
Aw, congratulations, you two!

09:18.014 --> 09:21.365
This has gotta be in my top
five most romantic robberies!

09:23.454 --> 09:25.108
I just don't get it!

09:25.152 --> 09:27.241
How does something like
this even happen?!

09:27.284 --> 09:29.460
Life is full of mysteries.

09:29.504 --> 09:31.245
-Whoa!

09:31.288 --> 09:33.160
Ain't that just the way?

09:35.901 --> 09:38.295
Cricket, look out!
I'ts Gabriela!

09:38.339 --> 09:40.341
Yeah, that's my GF.
No big deal.

09:40.384 --> 09:41.472
- Cricket!
- Right!

09:44.693 --> 09:45.737
Oh, hey, Gabs. 'Sup?

09:48.610 --> 09:51.874
Aw, man. What sort of crazy
place are we at now?

09:51.917 --> 09:53.093
Well, how 'bout that?

09:53.136 --> 09:54.157
Well, Cricket, what do you think

09:54.181 --> 09:55.660
of my spaghetti theory now?

09:55.704 --> 09:57.053
What are you talking about?

09:57.097 --> 09:58.576
You said everything
was intertwined

09:58.620 --> 10:00.709
but I haven't seen any
proof of that!

10:00.752 --> 10:02.319
Oh, hey!
There you are, kids!

10:02.624 --> 10:05.627
The oven's
still fussin' so dinner
isn't ready yet.

10:05.670 --> 10:06.802
Aww.

10:06.845 --> 10:08.108
Man, I'm starvin'!

10:08.151 --> 10:09.500
Now what are we supposed to eat?

10:09.848 --> 10:11.763
Ahh! Huh?

10:12.112 --> 10:13.374
Wow!

10:16.420 --> 10:18.814
Wow. It's as if seemingly
random events

10:18.857 --> 10:22.383
influence each other in
tiny ways that we can't
even perceive.

10:22.426 --> 10:25.168
- Just like a bowl of...
- hot dogs.

10:25.212 --> 10:27.344
You know what? Sure.

10:27.388 --> 10:31.131
- Who's gonna pay for all these?!
- I'm ruined!
