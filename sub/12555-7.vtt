05:14.439 --> 05:16.521
WE JUST DON'T

05:16.608 --> 05:18.144
WE'VE BEEN HERE
TWO MINUTES ALREADY,

05:18.235 --> 05:20.067

ABOUT THE PARDON.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.400
HOW ABOUT
IT, ALLENBY?

05:27.494 --> 05:29.952
YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK, THE

REVIEVVING CASES OF HOMICIDE.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.289
YOU'VE BEEN HERE
FOUR YEARS NOW,

05:34.376 --> 05:36.538
SO THAT MAKES
46 MORE TO GO,

05:36.586 --> 05:39.669

COMFORTABLE, HUH?

05:39.756 --> 05:41.588
CORRY, WE DON'T
MAKE THE RULES.

05:41.675 --> 05:45.043
WE DELIVER SUPPLIES
AND PASS ON INFORMATION.

05:45.136 --> 05:48.879
THERE'S BEEN PRESSURE BACK HOME
ABOUT THIS KIND OF PUNISHMENT.

05:48.974 --> 05:52.433
A LOT PEOPLE THINK IT'S
UNNECESSARILY CRUEL.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.977
THEY MAY CHANGE THEIR
MINDS AND ALTER THE LAVV,

05:55.063 --> 05:58.306
AND IMPRISON YOU ON EARTH

EVERY MORNING,
WHEN I GET UP,

06:09.160 --> 06:13.324
I TELL MYSELF THIS IS
MY LAST DAY OF SANITY.

06:13.415 --> 06:16.828
I CAN'T STAND THIS
LONELINESS ONE MORE DAY.

06:16.918 --> 06:20.252
NOT ONE MORE DAY!

06:20.297 --> 06:22.459
BY NOON, WHEN I CAN'T
KEEP MY FINGERS STILL,

06:22.549 --> 06:26.668

06:26.761 --> 06:28.547
<i>DOWN DEEP

06:28.638 --> 06:32.176
I GET AN ACHE THAT'S
JUST PULLING EVERYTHING OUT.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.759
THEN I FORCE MYSELF TO
HOLD ON FOR ONE MORE DAY.

06:34.811 --> 06:38.145
JUST ONE MORE DAY!

06:38.231 --> 06:40.939
BUT I CAN'T DO THAT
FOR ANOTHER 46 YEARS.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.516
I'LL GO RIGHT
OUT OF MY MIND.

06:42.611 --> 06:45.023

SOMETHING ELSE TOO.

07:18.146 --> 07:22.231
IT'D MEAN MY JOB

07:24.319 --> 07:26.356
IT'D BE MY NECK IF THEY
FOUND OUT FOR SURE.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.481
LOOK, ALLENBY.

07:32.369 --> 07:35.828
I DON'T
WANT ANY GIFTS.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.738
I DON'T
WANT TIDBITS.

07:37.832 --> 07:39.698
MAKES ME FEEL LIKE

07:45.715 --> 07:48.423
THAT'S THE ONLY
GIFT I WANT.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.251
I'M NOT A MURDERER.

07:50.345 --> 07:52.256

IN SELF-DEFENSE.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.258
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF

STOPPING HERE
FOUR TIMES A YEAR

08:10.156 --> 08:13.615

13:23.511 --> 13:25.047
YES.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.175
WHY WOULD--

13:27.223 --> 13:31.467
WHY DIDN'T THEY BUILD YOU
TO LOOK LIKE A MACHINE?

13:31.561 --> 13:33.518
WHY DIDN'T THEY BUILD
YOU OUT OF METAL

13:33.604 --> 13:35.766
WITH BOLTS AND WIRES
AND ELECTRODES

13:35.857 --> 13:39.395
AND THINGS LIKE THAT?

13:39.485 --> 13:42.944
VVHY'D THEY TURN YOU INTO A LIE-

13:43.031 --> 13:47.025
COVER YOU WITH SOMETHING
THAT LOOKS LIKE FLESH--

13:47.118 --> 13:48.199
GIVE YOU A FACE?

13:53.624 --> 13:57.242
A FACE
THAT IF I--

13:57.337 --> 14:01.797
IF I LOOK AT LONG
ENOUGH, MAKES ME THINK-

14:01.883 --> 14:03.624
MAKES ME

14:09.557 --> 14:11.218
IT'S A LIE!

14:46.469 --> 14:48.836
THIS ISN'T REAL FLESH.

14:48.930 --> 14:50.420
THERE AREN'T ANY
NERVES UNDER THERE.

14:50.515 --> 14:53.974
THERE AREN'T ANY
MUSCLES OR TENDONS.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.927
YOU'RE JUST
LIKE THIS HEAP--

14:57.021 --> 15:01.106
A HUNK OF METAL VVITH ARMS
AND LEGS INSTEAD OF VVHEELS.

15:01.150 --> 15:04.268
BUT THIS HEAP DOESN'T
MOCK ME THE VVAY YOU DO.

15:04.362 --> 15:06.148
IT DOESN'T LOOK AT ME
WITH MAKE-BELIEVE EYES,

15:06.239 --> 15:09.106
OR TALK TO ME WITH
A MAKE-BELIEVE VOICE.

15:09.158 --> 15:13.868
VVELL, I'M SICK OF BEING MOCKED
BY THE MEMORY OF VVOMEN.

15:13.955 --> 15:16.492

ALL YOU ARE--

15:16.582 --> 15:18.289
A REMINDER TO ME

15:18.376 --> 15:19.912
I'M ABOUT TO
LOSE MY MIND.

15:44.652 --> 15:47.360
I CAN FEEL
LONELINESS, TOO.
