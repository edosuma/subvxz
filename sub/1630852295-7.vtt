00:35.000 --> 00:37.006
Hey, sleeping beauty.
Wake up.

00:37.008 --> 00:38.011
Hey, wake up!

00:38.013 --> 00:39.022
Darn it, why isn't this working?

00:40.000 --> 00:41.006
Hmm...

00:45.001 --> 00:46.003
Hey wake up!

00:46.005 --> 00:48.014
Susie?
Am I dreaming?

00:48.016 --> 00:49.021
No, you're awake.

00:49.023 --> 00:51.011
I'm communicating with you
telepathically

00:51.013 --> 00:53.001
while I'm off
the island on business.

00:53.003 --> 00:56.011
Now, I need you to do
something very important.

00:56.013 --> 00:57.021
I think I might have left
my oven on.

00:57.023 --> 00:59.008
I need you to go check.

00:59.010 --> 01:02.016
If it's on, turn it off,
but don't touch anything else.

01:02.018 --> 01:04.015
There's a lot of dangerous
magical artifacts in there

01:04.017 --> 01:07.000
and a lot of them prey
on weakness, so...

01:07.002 --> 01:09.003
Prey on weakness.

01:09.005 --> 01:11.019
Wow, I can't believe
you're entrusting me with
this.

01:11.021 --> 01:13.010
I'm honored.
What?

01:13.012 --> 01:15.014
No, you just have the most
telepathically intrudable mind.

01:15.016 --> 01:17.009
Now get goin'!

01:21.023 --> 01:23.002
Susie?

01:23.004 --> 01:25.007
Oh right.
She's not here.

01:25.009 --> 01:26.012
That's why I'm here.

01:26.014 --> 01:29.002
Checking to see if her oven
is...

01:29.004 --> 01:30.010
And it's off.

01:34.008 --> 01:36.008
Susie's magical
living toothpaste!

01:36.010 --> 01:38.002
He must have died
of old age.

01:38.004 --> 01:39.015
I know Susie said don't touch
anything,

01:39.017 --> 01:43.003
but it seems wrong
to just leave him lying here.

01:44.010 --> 01:47.017
Hup!
Hyuh!

01:47.019 --> 01:50.009
Hmph!

01:50.011 --> 01:52.017
There are those who shine
a light so bright

01:52.019 --> 01:55.016
in this world that even
after their tube is squoze,

01:55.018 --> 01:57.018
the power of that light
leaves us clean

01:57.020 --> 02:00.005
and refreshed for up
to 12 hours after.

02:00.007 --> 02:01.012
What are you doing?
Oh!

02:01.014 --> 02:03.018
Sorry!
Thought you were...not alive.

02:03.020 --> 02:07.003
What?!
No, I was taking a nap!

02:07.005 --> 02:09.002
Why were you lying
in the middle of the floor?

02:09.004 --> 02:10.017
Uh, Susie's out of town!

02:10.019 --> 02:13.011
I never get to lie in the middle
of the floor.

02:13.013 --> 02:15.022
Now if you'll excuse me.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.015
Guess I'll fill this hole
back up.

02:18.017 --> 02:20.010
Aah!

02:20.012 --> 02:21.015
Huh?

02:21.017 --> 02:23.009
Wow, this root I dug up
looks like...

02:23.011 --> 02:25.010
Looks just like
a little man!

02:25.012 --> 02:27.005
Thirsty...

02:27.007 --> 02:29.021
Hang on, little root man sir!

02:33.005 --> 02:35.013
Here you go, little fella.

02:38.007 --> 02:40.003
Oh, I get it.

02:40.005 --> 02:41.017
You're a root.

02:44.012 --> 02:46.013
Ahh.
Thank you.

02:46.015 --> 02:47.012
Who are you?

02:47.014 --> 02:48.018
I'm Jeremiah.

02:48.020 --> 02:49.018
Can I have a hug?

02:49.020 --> 02:51.020
Oh!
Okay.

02:51.022 --> 02:52.022
Mmm.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.010
Geez, I'm getting sleepy.

02:55.015 --> 02:57.015
Probably because I'm up so late.

02:57.017 --> 03:00.009
I'm hungry!

03:00.011 --> 03:01.014
Do you like chips?

03:01.016 --> 03:03.000
Mm-hmm!

03:03.002 --> 03:06.012
Yumyumyum!

03:06.014 --> 03:08.010
You like cherries?
Mm-hmm!

03:08.012 --> 03:09.013
Down the hatch!

03:11.014 --> 03:13.014
Are you sure
this is helping you?

03:13.016 --> 03:16.006
Oh yes, I'm feeling
so much better! Mm, mm!

03:18.006 --> 03:19.022
But I'm getting really tired.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.014
I've gotta get back to my cabin
and go back to sleep.

03:22.016 --> 03:24.003
Aww...

03:24.005 --> 03:26.019
No!
Awww!

03:26.021 --> 03:28.006
It's okay, little fella.

03:28.008 --> 03:30.011
I'll come back tomorrow
and see how you're doing.

03:30.013 --> 03:31.019
I promise!

03:39.001 --> 03:40.010
Morning, Hedgehog.

03:40.012 --> 03:41.017
Bubby, where have you been?

03:41.019 --> 03:43.002
You weren't at breakfast.

03:43.004 --> 03:45.005
Oh man, I thought
this <i>was</i> <i>breakfast.</i>

03:45.007 --> 03:47.000
Guess I didn't get much sleep
last night.

03:47.002 --> 03:49.015
But that's because I found
something amazing

03:49.017 --> 03:51.005
in Susie's backyard.

03:51.007 --> 03:55.001
Oscar, you shouldn't be sneaking
back there while Susie's away.

03:55.003 --> 03:56.007
No, it's okay.

03:56.009 --> 03:57.023
I had permission...

03:58.001 --> 03:59.001
of sorts.

04:02.011 --> 04:03.021
I'll come check it out later.

04:03.023 --> 04:05.015
I gotta go find Lucy,
she hasn't shown up either

04:05.017 --> 04:07.023
and we're supposed
to do yoga today.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.014
Lucy?

04:11.016 --> 04:12.019
Are you here?

04:12.021 --> 04:14.000
Go away.

04:16.006 --> 04:18.000
I don't know what happened.

04:18.002 --> 04:20.022
I was feeling fine when I went
to bed last night.

04:23.002 --> 04:24.008
Scram, Hedgehog.

04:24.010 --> 04:26.019
You don't wanna catch
whatever I've got.

04:26.021 --> 04:29.007
But also could you bring me
some orange juice?

04:29.009 --> 04:30.009
Yeah...

04:30.011 --> 04:32.004
I'll totally get you
orange juice.

04:32.006 --> 04:35.000
You just rest
until I come back.

04:35.002 --> 04:36.008
Quick follow up.

04:36.010 --> 04:38.000
I also need my heating pad,
a thick duvet,

04:38.002 --> 04:39.021
a sleep mask,
and take this walkie-talkie

04:39.023 --> 04:42.016
so I can get ahold of you
if I need something else.

04:44.020 --> 04:45.022
Whoa, Jeremiah!

04:46.000 --> 04:47.007
You're looking all
filled out dude!

04:47.009 --> 04:49.012
I found some blocks
for you to play with.

04:49.014 --> 04:53.017
So, uh, what was it
like living under ground?

04:53.019 --> 04:54.017
Cold.

04:54.019 --> 04:56.021
That, makes sense.
Uh...

04:56.023 --> 04:58.013
What's, uh,
your favorite color?

04:58.015 --> 05:00.004
Mine's Hedgehog's sweater red.

05:00.006 --> 05:03.010
Actually, no, maybe
it's Hedgehog's hat purple.

05:03.012 --> 05:05.005
I like Susie's hair color.

05:05.007 --> 05:06.012
Oh, you know Susie?

05:06.014 --> 05:08.004
Yeah.
We're old friends.

05:08.006 --> 05:09.018
How's she doing these days?

05:09.020 --> 05:11.017
Is she strong?

05:11.019 --> 05:12.021
Strong?

05:12.023 --> 05:14.005
I don't know her
training regimen,

05:14.007 --> 05:16.008
but she's looking
pretty cut these days.

05:16.010 --> 05:18.010
Cut?
That sounds scary!

05:18.012 --> 05:20.011
Uppies?
Aww.

05:20.013 --> 05:21.021
Oscar?
Hello?

05:21.023 --> 05:23.008
One sec, Jeremiah.

05:23.010 --> 05:25.008
Aww, buddy.

05:25.010 --> 05:27.001
Be right back, okay?

05:29.012 --> 05:30.021
Hey Hedgehog.

05:30.023 --> 05:32.010
Hey, sorry I'm late!

05:32.012 --> 05:34.014
Lucy and a bunch of campers
came down with something.

05:34.016 --> 05:36.004
So I've been
helping people out.

05:36.006 --> 05:37.012
Hm.

05:37.014 --> 05:40.001
Now that I think of it,
I'm not feeling so hot myself.

05:40.003 --> 05:42.016
I thought I was just tired
from taking care of Jeremiah.

05:42.018 --> 05:45.000
Who's Jeremiah?

05:45.002 --> 05:47.019
Oscar!
Uppies!

05:47.021 --> 05:49.004
This is Jeremiah!

05:49.006 --> 05:50.017
He's Susie's friend.

05:50.019 --> 05:51.016
Uppies?

05:51.018 --> 05:53.015
Uhh, Oscar.

05:53.017 --> 05:55.006
Are you washing your hands?

05:55.008 --> 05:59.008
Oh, you don't mind
when it's your kid's germs!

05:59.010 --> 06:00.018
Dinner time, buddy!

06:00.020 --> 06:02.020
Let's get you big and strong.

06:06.022 --> 06:08.019
<i>Hedgehog!
I need some juice.</i>

06:08.021 --> 06:09.019
<i>Over!</i>

06:09.021 --> 06:11.002
Duty calls.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.023
If you need anything
just give me a shout.

06:16.014 --> 06:17.015
Hmm.

06:17.017 --> 06:19.012
Everyone's windows
are wide open!

06:19.014 --> 06:20.017
Must have been a hot night!

06:20.019 --> 06:22.013
Good thing I run cold.

06:26.007 --> 06:27.010
Ah -- ah-choo!

06:27.012 --> 06:29.006
Ugh.

06:29.008 --> 06:32.015
My bottom is cold
but my top is hot.

06:35.005 --> 06:36.019
Hey Lem.
Are you okay?

06:36.021 --> 06:38.002
Yeah, I'm fine.

06:38.004 --> 06:39.017
Lunch monster didn't show up
for work today.

06:39.019 --> 06:43.002
So I finally have an opportunity
to do breakfast correctly.

06:43.004 --> 06:44.003
What is it?

06:44.005 --> 06:46.000
It's veggie cereal candy soup.

06:46.002 --> 06:48.023
I'm <i>not</i> <i>sharing today.</i>

06:49.001 --> 06:50.015
Fine by me.

06:50.017 --> 06:52.009
This could be the start
of a serious outbreak.

06:53.020 --> 06:55.007
<i>Hedgehog!
I need liquids!</i>

06:55.009 --> 06:59.011
<i>Repeat --
My body's low on liquids.</i>

06:59.013 --> 07:00.019
Copy that, Lucy.

07:00.021 --> 07:02.016
I'll bring you some liquids.

07:02.018 --> 07:04.010
<i>And solids!</i>

07:04.012 --> 07:08.000
Actually, I wouldn't mind
a liquid.

07:08.002 --> 07:10.007
Did you say liquids?

07:16.002 --> 07:17.017
Okay.

07:21.015 --> 07:24.014
Oscar?
Are you -- Oh!

07:24.016 --> 07:26.010
Hey, Hedgehog.

07:26.012 --> 07:27.020
Hey, buddy.

07:27.022 --> 07:30.019
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you don't look great.

07:30.021 --> 07:32.015
What can I say, Hedgehog.

07:32.017 --> 07:35.022
Being a dad, y'know,
getting sick is gonna happen.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.002
Well, I brought you someliquids and solids and comics.

07:39.004 --> 07:43.005
I'll just, uh,
throw them to you.

07:43.007 --> 07:44.017
Wow, thanks.

07:44.019 --> 07:48.021
When my eyes can focus again,
I'll definitely read these.

07:48.023 --> 07:50.010
Is Jeremiah okay?

07:50.012 --> 07:51.022
Better than okay!

07:52.000 --> 07:54.013
Every time I look at the kid,
he's getting stronger.

07:54.015 --> 07:55.020
Huh.

07:55.022 --> 07:58.005
Okay, I'll be back to check
on you later, then.

07:58.007 --> 08:00.000
Thanks, Hedge!

08:06.023 --> 08:08.012
Hmm.

08:27.008 --> 08:29.019
Candy soup...

08:37.009 --> 08:39.006
Oh my gosh,
I gotta tell Oscar!

08:40.018 --> 08:41.020
Ah!

08:41.022 --> 08:45.003
Oh, sorry, am I in my room?

08:46.014 --> 08:50.016
Hedgehog, now that I see you,
would it be too much

08:50.018 --> 08:54.022
to get some tissues,
maybe some decongestant?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.014
Mmmm, decongestant...

08:57.016 --> 09:00.000
Chicken noodle soup!

09:00.002 --> 09:01.007
Ah!

09:01.009 --> 09:04.007
Oscar!

09:04.009 --> 09:06.015
Open up!

09:06.017 --> 09:07.015
Oscar!

09:07.017 --> 09:08.021
Jeremiah's trouble!

09:09.022 --> 09:11.015
What?!
Oscar!

09:11.017 --> 09:14.009
One step closer,
and I drain him dry.

09:14.011 --> 09:17.001
Jeremiah, my beautiful boy,
it's your rebellious phase!

09:17.003 --> 09:19.005
Don't worry son, we'll make
it through it together.

09:19.007 --> 09:20.021
You're not my dad, Oscar!

09:20.023 --> 09:22.019
Jeremiah, how could you!

09:22.021 --> 09:24.001
How could I?

09:24.003 --> 09:25.013
How could you blame me?

09:25.015 --> 09:27.008
Susie buried me in the ground!

09:27.010 --> 09:30.015
It's cold and damp
and lonely down there.

09:30.017 --> 09:33.008
But I'm out and I'm gonna
do whatever I want!

09:37.020 --> 09:38.019
Oh, no.

09:38.021 --> 09:41.005
Aah!

09:41.007 --> 09:43.010
I'm gonna go get help!

09:43.012 --> 09:44.018
Waah!

09:44.020 --> 09:47.005
Hedgehog, you've been snooping
on me the whole time!

09:47.007 --> 09:51.000
I'm gonna drain you of all your
energy until you're worm food!

09:51.002 --> 09:52.016
Jeremiah!
Don't!

09:52.018 --> 09:56.007
Okay, it's time to show
the tough love.

09:56.009 --> 09:57.021
Jeremiah Root!

09:57.023 --> 09:59.013
You put Hedgehog
down this instant

09:59.015 --> 10:02.006
or you're gonna be
in a lot of trouble, young root!

10:02.008 --> 10:05.006
You need to think
about your actions!

10:05.008 --> 10:08.021
I'm counting to three and then
I'm coming over there.

10:08.023 --> 10:10.001
One!

10:10.003 --> 10:11.004
Two!

10:11.006 --> 10:13.000
You better not let me
get to 3!

10:13.002 --> 10:14.017
Two and a half!

10:14.019 --> 10:15.021
Two and three quarters!

10:15.023 --> 10:17.011
Okay!
I'll put her down!

10:17.013 --> 10:20.015
Geez, man, no need to freak
out on me.

10:20.017 --> 10:22.008
Wait...
Why did I listen?

10:22.010 --> 10:25.003
I'm taller and stronger
than both of you combined!

10:25.005 --> 10:27.009
Cause I'm your pa?

10:27.011 --> 10:28.013
I'm nobody's child!

10:28.015 --> 10:30.001
I'm a strong, independent,
mature --

10:30.003 --> 10:31.010
Whoa!

10:34.011 --> 10:35.020
Tree being!

10:35.022 --> 10:37.013
Good job, Oscar, I told you
not to touch anything

10:37.015 --> 10:38.018
and somehow you managed
to release

10:38.020 --> 10:41.015
this energy-stealing mandrake.

10:41.017 --> 10:43.002
If you take them out of the
ground too early,

10:43.004 --> 10:45.019
they get attitude problems.

10:45.021 --> 10:48.002
Aw, my son is grounded.

10:48.004 --> 10:49.020
I should have raised you better.

10:49.022 --> 10:51.021
I was just too young y'know?

10:51.023 --> 10:54.008
Maybe we'll see each other
around or something?

10:54.010 --> 10:56.017
Ugh, okay, okay, I can see
you're attached.

10:56.019 --> 10:58.001
You can come and visit him.

10:59.011 --> 11:01.003
Yea, I'm gonna set down alittle Oscar-proofing, though.

11:01.005 --> 11:02.017
Haha, alright!

11:18.007 --> 11:20.021
I had permission...
of sorts.
