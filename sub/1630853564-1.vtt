00:00.400 --> 00:04.320
This programme contains very
strong language from the outset.

00:28.360 --> 00:29.680
Bollocks!

00:29.720 --> 00:32.000
Hmm, the rubbish men are here.

00:32.000 --> 00:32.920
Hmm, the rubbish men are here.

00:37.280 --> 00:39.640
Oh, shit.

00:39.680 --> 00:40.000
I didn't put the bins out.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.520
I didn't put the bins out.

00:41.560 --> 00:44.000
Run down in your pants
and ask them to wait.

00:44.040 --> 00:46.160
I ain't doin' that again.

00:47.360 --> 00:48.000
Big day today.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.600
Big day today.

00:49.640 --> 00:52.080
Are you nervous?
Yeah. A little bit. Mmm.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.000
Mmm.

00:56.000 --> 00:56.080
Mmm.

00:56.120 --> 00:58.240
Mmm--

00:59.960 --> 01:01.400
Ohhh...

01:01.440 --> 01:02.560
Gah!

01:02.600 --> 01:04.000
If I show you my tits, will you
make me some toast before you go?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.600
If I show you my tits, will you
make me some toast before you go?

01:09.720 --> 01:11.600
Marmalade or jam?
Marmalade.

01:11.640 --> 01:12.000
All right, Paddington.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.080
All right, Paddington.

01:14.120 --> 01:16.320
It's an exciting day today,

01:16.360 --> 01:17.640
in lots of different ways.

01:17.680 --> 01:19.400
We've got some great guests
lined up,

01:19.440 --> 01:20.000
and we can't wait to get started,

01:20.000 --> 01:21.160
and we can't wait to get started,

01:21.200 --> 01:23.960
but first, over to
our local weather desk to hear...

01:29.680 --> 01:32.960
You need start-up money
for a mobile phone application?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.320
That's correct.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.000
And what does it do, exactly?

01:36.000 --> 01:36.320
And what does it do, exactly?

01:36.360 --> 01:38.560
It's a pattern spotter.
Futurist stuff.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.720
Market opportunities
for growing businesses.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.600
How do you spot the patterns?

01:42.640 --> 01:44.000
You step back far enough away,
and you watch.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.240
You step back far enough away,
and you watch.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.520
You know, conflicts brewing,

01:47.560 --> 01:50.560
certain products starting to sell
better than others,

01:50.600 --> 01:52.000
certain politicians starting to do
better than they should,

01:52.000 --> 01:53.200
certain politicians starting to do
better than they should,

01:53.240 --> 01:55.640
the age of shipping containers,
the health of monarchs.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.080
Everything is data.
It can all be analysed.

01:58.120 --> 02:00.000
Give me an example.

02:00.000 --> 02:00.080
Give me an example.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.960
Yeah, er...

02:02.840 --> 02:04.360
All right, DeWhitt and Weston.

Export and trading company
with an octogenarian CEO

02:08.000 --> 02:08.080
Export and trading company
with an octogenarian CEO

02:08.120 --> 02:10.120
with multiple children
from multiple marriages

02:10.160 --> 02:11.400
sittin' on the board.

02:11.440 --> 02:14.800
Now, there's a company headin'
for a period of uncertainty

02:14.840 --> 02:16.000
if ever I've seen one.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.240
if ever I've seen one.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.320
And what's the app called?

02:21.360 --> 02:23.600
Er, we're gonna call it
Hazard Lights.

02:24.800 --> 02:27.040
We think it's gonna
change your life.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.000
I am so proud of you.

02:32.000 --> 02:32.160
I am so proud of you.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.240
You big fucking nerd.
Thank you.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.520
It's too early
to predict whether or not

02:39.560 --> 02:40.000
the virus is going to continue
in its growth,

02:40.000 --> 02:41.920
the virus is going to continue
in its growth,

02:41.960 --> 02:43.120
but we are hopeful...

02:52.760 --> 02:54.920
Congratulations.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.000
Shut up...

02:56.000 --> 02:56.320
Shut up...

02:58.120 --> 02:59.720
No...
Yep.

Are you gonna make me another
cup of tea or-- Fuck off!

03:04.000 --> 03:06.360
Are you gonna make me another
cup of tea or-- Fuck off!

03:06.400 --> 03:08.360
Aaaaaah!

Congratulations, man.

03:58.720 --> 04:00.000
Cheers, mate.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.560
Cheers, mate.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.360
She's a good woman.

04:04.640 --> 04:07.520
Yeah, she's...
she's all right, I guess.

04:07.560 --> 04:08.000
No, I mean it.
She's a good woman, mate.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.400
No, I mean it.
She's a good woman, mate.

04:12.680 --> 04:13.880
Look after her, huh?

04:13.920 --> 04:16.000
I can barely look after
myself, but OK.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.160
I can barely look after
myself, but OK.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.600
Hmm.

04:29.080 --> 04:32.000
Daily infections continue
to grow at an alarming rate,

04:32.000 --> 04:32.520
Daily infections continue
to grow at an alarming rate,

04:32.560 --> 04:35.320
and Government advisers warn
that the overall death toll...

04:35.360 --> 04:37.440
..much higher
than initially forecast...

04:37.480 --> 04:39.600
..the Prime Minister...
..those displaying...

04:39.640 --> 04:40.000
...MERS-22 symptoms,

04:41.280 --> 04:43.720

number of cases are increasing...

04:43.760 --> 04:47.400
..and all are advised... ..face
masks... ..later today, and...

04:53.000 --> 04:54.720
Hey!

04:57.120 --> 05:00.200
I thought we said
a small tree. Yeah, we did.

05:00.240 --> 05:03.480
But then you left me to buy it
by myself and this happened.

05:03.520 --> 05:04.000
I'm gonna burn that bloody mask.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.160
I'm gonna burn that bloody mask.

05:05.200 --> 05:08.800
UK MERS-related deaths
are at over 1,700 a day,

05:08.840 --> 05:11.160
the highest since
the start of the pandemic.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.000
With existing hospitals
beyond capacity...

05:12.000 --> 05:13.640
With existing hospitals
beyond capacity...

05:13.680 --> 05:16.560
and emergency hospitals
at the O2 Arena and Olympia

05:16.600 --> 05:17.960
becoming overcrowded,

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
ministers are meeting to decide
what the next measures should be.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.320
ministers are meeting to decide
what the next measures should be.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.320
All are urged to stay at home...

05:23.360 --> 05:25.840
and only leave the house
if absolutely necessary.

05:25.880 --> 05:27.880
Those displaying...
It's gonna be all right.

05:27.920 --> 05:28.000
..and needing medical assistance...

05:28.000 --> 05:29.480
..and needing medical assistance...

05:29.520 --> 05:32.160

to hospital in an emergency...

05:57.920 --> 06:00.000
George, do you think we're gonna...

06:00.000 --> 06:00.760
George, do you think we're gonna...

06:00.800 --> 06:02.240
die?

06:04.320 --> 06:06.120
Bollocks!

06:06.160 --> 06:08.000
Jesus fucking Christ.

06:08.000 --> 06:08.160
Jesus fucking Christ.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.360
It's OK, we can just take it
to the tip.

06:15.520 --> 06:16.000
Big day today.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.480
Big day today.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.200
Huh?

06:19.240 --> 06:21.560
Pitch day. Meeting at the bank.

06:28.760 --> 06:30.800
Are you OK?

06:30.840 --> 06:32.000
Yeah...

06:32.000 --> 06:32.440
Yeah...

06:32.560 --> 06:33.920
Ohhh...

06:33.960 --> 06:35.240
Aah!

06:35.280 --> 06:39.600
If I show you my tits, will you
make me some toast before you go?

06:51.880 --> 06:53.880
It's an exciting day today

06:53.920 --> 06:55.440
in lots of different ways.

06:55.480 --> 06:56.000
We've got some great
guests lined up,

We've got some great
guests lined up,

06:57.360 --> 06:59.080
and we can't wait to get started,

06:59.120 --> 07:01.960
but first over to
our local weather desk to hear...

07:07.040 --> 07:09.440
We've already done this?

07:09.480 --> 07:11.160
Yeah, we've...

07:12.040 --> 07:16.680
Er, I'm sorry, this is...
this is very...

07:16.720 --> 07:19.080
Look, I'm...
I'm having a strange day.

07:20.120 --> 07:21.840
We've met, though.

07:21.880 --> 07:23.520
Do you remember?

07:23.560 --> 07:25.200
You gave me a loan...

07:26.800 --> 07:28.000
I have no record of that.
You did.

07:28.000 --> 07:28.920
I have no record of that.
You did.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.960
You gave me a-- a big loan,

07:31.000 --> 07:34.520
I rented an office and my company...

07:34.560 --> 07:36.000
Right...

07:36.000 --> 07:36.120
Right...

07:37.000 --> 07:39.080
Everything was really good.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.360
Hey!

07:50.880 --> 07:52.000
How did it go?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.040
How did it go?

07:56.800 --> 07:58.800
George?
I think something's wrong.

07:58.840 --> 08:00.000
What is it?

08:00.000 --> 08:00.840
What is it?

08:05.440 --> 08:07.640
We've done this before.

08:07.680 --> 08:08.000
What do you mean?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.480
What do you mean?

08:11.480 --> 08:13.000
How did the meeting go?
Terrible.

08:13.040 --> 08:15.480
But we-- we've done...

08:15.520 --> 08:16.000
..all this before.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.480
..all this before.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.280
We... we did this day.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.920
We got married,
gonna have a baby...

08:22.960 --> 08:24.000
We're gonna have a what?
Uh, people were gettin' sick again.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.640
We're gonna have a what?
Uh, people were gettin' sick again.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.920
It was Christmas,
it was really bad?

08:27.960 --> 08:30.240
Have you taken something?

08:30.280 --> 08:32.000
No!
George?

08:32.000 --> 08:32.200
No!
George?

08:32.240 --> 08:34.200
Sarah, I haven't taken anything.
I...

08:41.960 --> 08:43.720
I don't know,
I'm just tired.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.160
A little drunk, that's all.
You didn't get the loan?

08:46.200 --> 08:48.000
No, I...

08:49.720 --> 08:51.000
No.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.760
Could you just take it?

09:01.800 --> 09:04.000
I don't need to.
Please?

09:04.000 --> 09:04.160
I don't need to.
Please?

09:04.200 --> 09:08.080
George, I'm not gonna take
a test just cos you've asked me to.

09:08.120 --> 09:11.120
I'm not pregnant, which is
a good thing, by the way.

09:11.160 --> 09:12.000
Why?

09:12.000 --> 09:12.560
Why?

09:12.600 --> 09:14.440
I don't know.

09:14.480 --> 09:19.120
Er, it's just not a good time
right now, is it?

09:20.480 --> 09:22.320
Money's tight.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.680
It's not something we've planned.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.000
This is weird.

09:36.000 --> 09:36.320
This is weird.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.160
George?

10:10.920 --> 10:14.200
George?

10:25.040 --> 10:27.560
George, I want you to see someone.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.600
Who?
I don't know.

10:29.640 --> 10:31.560
A psychologist? A therapist?

10:32.600 --> 10:34.400
They can't help you.

10:38.040 --> 10:39.680
They might.

10:39.720 --> 10:40.000
What am I gonna tell 'em?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.680
What am I gonna tell 'em?

10:42.480 --> 10:43.920
Tell them about your dreams.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.920
They weren't dreams, Sarah!

10:46.960 --> 10:48.000
I lived six months.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.840
I lived six months.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.520
And look, look, look...

10:51.560 --> 10:55.240
This is going to grow. It's going
to mutate and it's going to spread.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.000
In about two months, the country'll
be back in lockdown,

10:56.000 --> 10:57.680
In about two months, the country'll
be back in lockdown,

10:57.720 --> 10:59.920
people will be wearing face masks
again... Stop it!

10:59.960 --> 11:02.360
You're scaring me.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.000
Please, please talk to someone.

11:04.000 --> 11:04.880
Please, please talk to someone.

11:04.920 --> 11:08.080
I thought I was talking to you.
Someone that can help.

11:13.480 --> 11:16.240
I don't recognise him any more.

11:16.280 --> 11:19.520
It's like he just woke up
one morning a different person.

11:20.400 --> 11:23.320
Sarah, I hate to say it, but
from everything you've told me,

11:23.360 --> 11:25.560
it sounds like he's checking out
of the relationship.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.000
Sounds like he's trying to push you
away. Well, it's really working.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.400
Sounds like he's trying to push you
away. Well, it's really working.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.720
What are you doing?

11:42.240 --> 11:44.000
Er, it says here, er,

11:44.000 --> 11:44.800
Er, it says here, er,

11:44.840 --> 11:48.320
"Doctors warn of potential epidemic
on the horizon.

11:48.360 --> 11:50.960
Look... It's coming.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.600
Sarah...

11:54.640 --> 11:56.720
What are you doin'?

11:58.680 --> 12:00.000
I'm gonna stay at my mum's.
I know it sounds crazy.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.760
I'm gonna stay at my mum's.
I know it sounds crazy.

12:01.800 --> 12:05.320
But you just have to trust me.
I'm just trying to keep us safe.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.520
That's all I want--
George, you need help!

12:07.560 --> 12:08.000
Everyone's worried about you, I--
What... what do you mean, everyone?

12:08.000 --> 12:10.280
Everyone's worried about you, I--
What... what do you mean, everyone?

12:10.320 --> 12:12.040
Karl thinks you have
a personality disorder.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.960
His cousin suffered-- Oh, Karl! I
bet fucking Karl said that!

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
God knows why he'd want you
to think that!

12:16.000 --> 12:17.200
God knows why he'd want you
to think that!

12:17.240 --> 12:19.640
The thing is, Karl's gonna
be coughing his lungs up

12:19.680 --> 12:22.880
into a fucking mass grave
if you don't lis--

12:22.920 --> 12:24.000
Sar...

12:24.000 --> 12:25.120
Sar...

12:40.280 --> 12:42.040
Let her go.

12:43.640 --> 12:45.280
What?

12:46.760 --> 12:48.000
Trust me. It's not gonna work.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.520
Trust me. It's not gonna work.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.200
You're not ready
for what's happening,

12:51.240 --> 12:52.960
how do you think she's gonna feel?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.400
Anyway, I'm pretty sure you'll
get another chance with her.

12:55.440 --> 12:56.000
Sorry, who are you? You've been
searchin' for somethin', George.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Sorry, who are you? You've been
searchin' for somethin', George.

12:59.040 --> 13:03.080
"Time travel", "time loops",
"time jumps", "Tim jumps"...

13:03.120 --> 13:04.000
I'm pretty sure that last one
was a typo.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.600
I'm pretty sure that last one
was a typo.

13:05.640 --> 13:07.360
And you're worried
about the viral outbreak.

13:07.400 --> 13:10.560
You should be. It's already much
worse than the news is lettin' on.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.000
Seriously, who are you? I'm someone
with answers to your questions.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.680
Seriously, who are you? I'm someone
with answers to your questions.

13:13.720 --> 13:16.800
Did you go back too?
Did you-- did you feel it too?

13:16.840 --> 13:20.000
Tell you what. If it happens again,
go straight to this address.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.040
Tell you what. If it happens again,
go straight to this address.

13:24.960 --> 13:26.720
Ple-- please, tell me who you are.

13:26.760 --> 13:28.000
Maybe I'll see you, George.

13:28.000 --> 13:28.760
Maybe I'll see you, George.

13:59.520 --> 14:00.000
...the number of MERS-22
related deaths rise exponentially,

14:00.000 --> 14:04.040
...the number of MERS-22
related deaths rise exponentially,

14:04.080 --> 14:06.960
Government advisors call
for tighter restrictions

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
to be put in place
for the Christmas period.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.960
to be put in place
for the Christmas period.

14:17.640 --> 14:22.080
MERS-related deaths
in the UK are at 1,800 a day

14:22.120 --> 14:24.000
and show no signs of slowing down.

14:24.000 --> 14:24.240
and show no signs of slowing down.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.080
With existing health services
completely overrun,

14:27.120 --> 14:29.520
patients are being turned away
from hospitals...

14:29.560 --> 14:31.920
..unable to accommodate them...

14:35.600 --> 14:38.040
Bollocks!

14:38.080 --> 14:40.000
Mmph...

14:40.000 --> 14:40.200
Mmph...

14:41.280 --> 14:43.120
George?

14:47.760 --> 14:48.000
Can I kiss you?
Sure?

14:48.000 --> 14:49.800
Can I kiss you?
Sure?

14:52.080 --> 14:54.600
Mm!Oh, I love you.

14:54.640 --> 14:56.000
I love you, I love you...
Oh!

14:56.000 --> 14:57.200
I love you, I love you...
Oh!

15:01.280 --> 15:03.320
You need to brush your teeth.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.000
I love you too.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.360
I love you too.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.280
Are you all right?

15:09.560 --> 15:12.000
Sorry. I have to go...

15:12.000 --> 15:12.280
Sorry. I have to go...

15:13.400 --> 15:16.400
Remember you have the meeting
at the bank today! Yeah!

15:44.240 --> 15:46.640
Freaks you out at first,
doesn't it?

15:46.680 --> 15:48.520
I need to know what's goin' on.

15:48.560 --> 15:50.960
When did you start to notice
time was jumping backwards?

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
This is the second time
it's happened. Aah.

15:52.000 --> 15:52.920
This is the second time
it's happened. Aah.

15:52.960 --> 15:56.120
Did you enjoy living the last six
months again? It was a nightmare.

15:56.160 --> 15:58.440
Sorry to hear that--
What the fuck's goin' on?

15:58.480 --> 15:59.760
What's going on. Yeah, OK.

15:59.800 --> 16:00.000
Here's the thing.
Don't take this the wrong way,

16:00.000 --> 16:02.080
Here's the thing.
Don't take this the wrong way,

16:02.120 --> 16:03.920
but you're a mutant.
A mutant?

16:03.960 --> 16:05.880
Yeah, not like,
fucking Wolverine or anything.

16:05.920 --> 16:08.000
I just mean the cells in your body
have changed in a fairly...

16:08.000 --> 16:09.960
I just mean the cells in your body
have changed in a fairly...

16:10.000 --> 16:11.680
unusualway.

16:11.720 --> 16:16.000
.000001 per cent of the world's
population can recall time jumps.

16:16.000 --> 16:16.760
.000001 per cent of the world's
population can recall time jumps.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.440
Usually, the ability
is manufactured

16:18.480 --> 16:20.440
and given to suitable candidates.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.920
Very, very occasionally,

16:21.960 --> 16:24.000
someone will develop
the ability organically.

16:24.000 --> 16:24.760
someone will develop
the ability organically.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.240
You, in this case.
Recall... time jumps?

16:27.280 --> 16:29.040
Discarded timelines.

16:29.080 --> 16:32.000
You've experienced over... 20
time jumps in your life so far.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
You've experienced over... 20
time jumps in your life so far.

16:33.040 --> 16:36.040
You just didn't remember them.
Why is time jumping backwards?

16:36.080 --> 16:38.080
Because we made it.
We?

16:38.120 --> 16:40.000
The Lazarus Project.
Right.

16:40.000 --> 16:40.120
The Lazarus Project.
Right.

16:40.160 --> 16:43.200
What? We're a top secret
multinational organisation

16:43.240 --> 16:45.840
dedicated to preventing and undoing
mass extinction events

16:45.880 --> 16:48.000
via diplomatic, scientific,
or militaristic means.

16:48.000 --> 16:48.280
via diplomatic, scientific,
or militaristic means.

16:48.320 --> 16:51.640
Oh, and we can make time go
backwards. When did the world end?

16:51.680 --> 16:54.360
Oh, I thought you'd start
with the time thing but, OK.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.000
The world ended in 1963
when Russia and America

16:56.000 --> 16:57.080
The world ended in 1963
when Russia and America

16:57.120 --> 16:59.080
launched nuclear warheads
at each other.

17:00.360 --> 17:03.600
It ended in 1979 when Pakistan
seriously overreacted

17:03.640 --> 17:04.000
to their Prime Minister being
assassinated by an Indian agent.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.880
to their Prime Minister being
assassinated by an Indian agent.

17:06.920 --> 17:10.720
It ended in 1983 when a scientist
at the Centre for Disease Control

17:10.760 --> 17:12.000
decided to take smallpox
for a walk.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.320
decided to take smallpox
for a walk.

17:13.360 --> 17:16.760
And it ended yesterday, when we
failed to develop a vaccination

17:16.800 --> 17:18.720
for a mutant strain of MERS.

17:18.760 --> 17:20.000
Again. Our bad.

17:20.000 --> 17:20.040
Again. Our bad.

17:20.080 --> 17:22.840
Those are just a few
off the top of my head.

17:22.880 --> 17:25.840
And you stopped all of them with...
with time travel?

17:25.880 --> 17:28.000
Only when we exhausted
all other methods.

17:28.000 --> 17:28.480
Only when we exhausted
all other methods.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.360
How's that work, exactly?

17:52.640 --> 17:55.080
Is this where you keep
the time machine?

17:55.120 --> 17:58.520
We don't really call it that.
Why not?

17:58.560 --> 18:00.000
Cos that's not what it is.

18:00.000 --> 18:00.640
Cos that's not what it is.

18:39.960 --> 18:40.000
So, if it isn't a time machine,
what is it?

18:40.000 --> 18:44.040
So, if it isn't a time machine,
what is it?

18:44.080 --> 18:45.840
It's a singularity.

18:45.880 --> 18:48.000
Right...
In space.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.480
Got it...

18:51.520 --> 18:52.880
No, you don't.

18:52.920 --> 18:55.440
That's the time machine.

18:55.480 --> 18:56.000
And that moment there,
that's the checkpoint.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.560
And that moment there,
that's the checkpoint.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.000
Like in a video game?
You die in the game,

19:00.040 --> 19:02.240
you go back to the last
checkpoint you reached

19:02.280 --> 19:04.000
every time until you reach
a new one? Yeah.

19:04.000 --> 19:04.480
every time until you reach
a new one? Yeah.

19:04.520 --> 19:08.320
Well, our checkpoint's that moment.
1st of July, every year.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.000
So, if you use it now...
We'd wake up yesterday.

19:12.000 --> 19:12.800
So, if you use it now...
We'd wake up yesterday.

19:12.840 --> 19:14.760
Every time we go back, we'd wake up

19:14.800 --> 19:17.000
on the morning
of the 1st of July 2022,

19:17.040 --> 19:20.000
until we go a whole year
and get to July 1st 2023,

19:20.000 --> 19:20.040
until we go a whole year
and get to July 1st 2023,

19:20.080 --> 19:21.640
and that becomes
our new checkpoint.

19:21.680 --> 19:25.400
So, you couldn't use it to go back
to, like, London in the 1800s?

19:25.440 --> 19:28.000
I'm a brown woman,
why the fuck would I want to?

19:28.000 --> 19:28.400
I'm a brown woman,
why the fuck would I want to?

19:28.440 --> 19:30.600
Yeah, OK, fair enough.

19:30.640 --> 19:33.280
So, so... how-- how
do you control it?

19:34.640 --> 19:36.000
Do you happen to have a degree in
quantum physics, by any chance? No.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.600
Do you happen to have a degree in
quantum physics, by any chance? No.

19:38.640 --> 19:42.000
Really not much point in me trying
to explain it to you, then.

19:45.360 --> 19:47.800
So, why didn't you
undo 9/11?

19:47.840 --> 19:49.280
The world didn't end.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.400
Thousands of people died.
There was a war.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.000
Not a nuclear war.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.160
Not a nuclear war.

19:53.200 --> 19:56.400
So what, you didn't want to stop
it-- The world didn't end.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.720
We can't reset every time
something bad happens.

19:59.760 --> 20:00.000
Then what? We travel back
whenever there's a mass murder?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.600
Then what? We travel back
whenever there's a mass murder?

20:02.640 --> 20:05.040
Or a plane crash?
Or a fire in a school?

20:05.080 --> 20:07.280
Or your dog dies
or you burn your toast?

20:07.320 --> 20:08.000
Are you equating the attack
on the World Trade Centre

20:08.000 --> 20:09.720
Are you equating the attack
on the World Trade Centre

20:09.760 --> 20:10.920
with burning your toast?

20:10.960 --> 20:13.360
We're not here to make
the world a better place,

20:13.400 --> 20:15.120
we're here to stop it from ending.

20:15.160 --> 20:16.000
What about coronavirus, why didn't
you go back and stop that?

20:16.000 --> 20:17.880
What about coronavirus, why didn't
you go back and stop that?

20:17.920 --> 20:20.560
You got a vaccine in nine months.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.680
You think we didn't go back?

20:25.000 --> 20:28.160
It's a lot to take in.

20:28.200 --> 20:29.720
Yeah.

20:29.760 --> 20:32.000
This morning I was supposed
to go to an interview

20:32.000 --> 20:33.520
This morning I was supposed
to go to an interview

20:33.560 --> 20:34.720
about a business loan--

20:34.760 --> 20:39.000
George, almost no one on the planet
has the ability you have.

20:39.040 --> 20:40.000
This is an incredibly rare gift.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.440
This is an incredibly rare gift.

20:41.480 --> 20:44.800
So, I wouldn't worry about
the loan, is what I'm sayin'.

20:44.840 --> 20:48.000
How'd you like to come
and save the world with us instead?

20:48.000 --> 20:48.040
How'd you like to come
and save the world with us instead?

20:48.080 --> 20:50.160
I don't know anything
about saving the world.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.680
Oh, you pick it up as you go along.

21:11.440 --> 21:12.000
Did you get it?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.080
Did you get it?

21:14.120 --> 21:15.880
Y-- yeah?

21:15.920 --> 21:17.960
Yeah, yeah, I think so...
Oooh!

21:18.000 --> 21:19.760
That's amazing.

21:23.080 --> 21:25.760
I mean, this could
be life-changing, right?

21:26.840 --> 21:28.000
Er, yeah...

21:28.000 --> 21:29.200
Er, yeah...

21:29.240 --> 21:31.640
Yeah, completely life-changing.

21:33.760 --> 21:36.000
It's a dual injection.
Two jabs, six weeks apart.

21:36.000 --> 21:36.640
It's a dual injection.
Two jabs, six weeks apart.

21:36.680 --> 21:38.960
80 to 85 per cent effective.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.400
And cost?

21:40.440 --> 21:42.480
Pharmaceutical company
has agreed a two-year moratorium

21:42.520 --> 21:43.640
on raising the price.

21:43.680 --> 21:44.000
Oh, they're all heart, aren't they?

21:44.000 --> 21:46.280
Oh, they're all heart, aren't they?

21:46.320 --> 21:47.720
What about the body count?

21:47.760 --> 21:50.040
We'll lose just under 20,000.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.840
Better than 20 million.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.800
Oh, erm, while I've got you...

21:55.840 --> 21:59.960
a nuclear warhead nicknamed Big Boy

22:00.000 --> 22:01.920
was hijacked while in transit
yesterday.

22:01.960 --> 22:03.800
Do we know who took it?

22:03.840 --> 22:05.640
Well, we're pretty sure
it wasn't UNICEF.

22:05.680 --> 22:08.000
But the good news
is that it is non-operational

22:08.000 --> 22:08.640
But the good news
is that it is non-operational

22:08.680 --> 22:11.880
without a unique detonator.
Wait, is no one worried about this?

22:11.920 --> 22:13.920
It's over 2,000...
Oh, these things happen.

22:13.960 --> 22:16.000
Probably come to nothing. Well...
Warheads get stolen a lot?

22:16.000 --> 22:16.880
Probably come to nothing. Well...
Warheads get stolen a lot?

22:16.920 --> 22:20.400
More than you would care to know.
Ah! Hello.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.880
Er, hi...
Everyone, this is George.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.000
You're the mutant?
Er, ye-- yeah, yeah...

22:24.000 --> 22:25.280
You're the mutant?
Er, ye-- yeah, yeah...

22:25.320 --> 22:27.520
So, you just started waking
up on the checkpoint

22:27.560 --> 22:29.960
with no idea what was going on?
Pretty much, yeah.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
That's crazy, man.

22:32.000 --> 22:32.120
That's crazy, man.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.000
Elizabeth Wesley.

22:34.040 --> 22:36.360
You can call me ma'am to my face

22:36.400 --> 22:40.000
and Wes behind my back.

22:40.040 --> 22:42.640
Welcome to the Lazarus Project,
George.

22:42.680 --> 22:45.040
Cheers. Er, ma'am.

22:45.080 --> 22:48.000
Hey, I'm Greta. Blake.

22:48.000 --> 22:48.080
Hey, I'm Greta. Blake.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.600
Erik Eriksen.
But everybody calls me The Dane.

22:50.640 --> 22:52.000
The Dane...

22:52.040 --> 22:56.000
And that ray of sunshine is
Shiv, our other resident mutant.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.080
And that ray of sunshine is
Shiv, our other resident mutant.

22:57.120 --> 23:00.320
Erm, so how,
how'd you all end up...

23:00.360 --> 23:02.160
Here? We got chosen.

23:02.200 --> 23:04.000
Ex-Danish Special Forces.
Jaeger Corps.

23:04.000 --> 23:04.640
Ex-Danish Special Forces.
Jaeger Corps.

23:04.680 --> 23:07.080
Royal Regiment of Scotland.
Black Watch.

23:07.120 --> 23:09.720
Reykjavik Metropolitan Police.
MI5.

23:10.480 --> 23:12.000
So, what do you do, George?

23:12.000 --> 23:12.880
So, what do you do, George?

23:13.800 --> 23:15.720
App developer...

23:15.760 --> 23:16.960
Oh. We--

23:17.000 --> 23:19.840
Well, that's sure to come in handy.

23:19.880 --> 23:20.000
Don't worry about him. I love apps.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.240
Don't worry about him. I love apps.

23:22.280 --> 23:23.920
Yeah, Grindr.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.760
Oh, are you gonna be coming
to our celebration?

23:30.800 --> 23:32.760
Er...
Oh, we have a little tradition.

23:32.800 --> 23:34.520
Every time we save humanity

23:34.560 --> 23:36.000
from being wiped off
the face of the Earth,

23:36.000 --> 23:36.840
from being wiped off
the face of the Earth,

23:36.880 --> 23:39.160
we go for two-for-one cocktails
and karaoke.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.920
Huh. How else would you know
what you're fightin' for?

23:41.960 --> 23:44.000
Exactly!

23:44.000 --> 23:44.120
Exactly!

23:46.040 --> 23:48.920
It's a lot to take in.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.800
Yeah...

23:52.080 --> 23:55.560
I'm not a super agent,
or whatever you are.

23:57.160 --> 23:59.600
How do you know
I can actually do this?

23:59.640 --> 24:00.000
Look, at the moment, you're
a squidgy ball of unhelpful dough

24:00.000 --> 24:03.960
Look, at the moment, you're
a squidgy ball of unhelpful dough

24:04.920 --> 24:07.600
that couldn't save the world
if his life depended on it,

24:07.640 --> 24:08.000
which, of course, it does.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.480
which, of course, it does.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.760
But you're in good enough
physical condition.

24:12.600 --> 24:15.440
You're highly educated, show an
aptitude for problem solving,

24:15.480 --> 24:16.000
can work well under pressure.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.600
can work well under pressure.

24:18.440 --> 24:21.480
Time skipped back six months,
but you didn't fall apart.

24:21.520 --> 24:23.200
You looked for answers.

24:23.240 --> 24:24.000
That matters.

24:24.000 --> 24:24.840
That matters.

24:28.440 --> 24:30.600
Fell apart a little bit...

24:31.800 --> 24:32.000
Yeah, I know.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.800
Yeah, I know.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.240
What does it feel like?

24:39.280 --> 24:40.000
When you save the world?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.040
When you save the world?

24:41.080 --> 24:44.880
Feels pretty good. You'll see.

25:12.160 --> 25:14.040
Not singing tonight?

25:14.080 --> 25:16.920
It helps them unwind, that's fine.

25:16.960 --> 25:18.720
Me?

25:18.760 --> 25:20.000
I don't.

25:20.000 --> 25:20.400
I don't.

25:20.440 --> 25:22.280
Don't?
Unwind.

25:24.080 --> 25:26.160
Yeah, I get that vibe from you.

25:26.200 --> 25:28.000
There's a warhead missing.

25:28.000 --> 25:28.120
There's a warhead missing.

25:30.080 --> 25:31.800
Yeah.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.600
So, there's that.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.440
Apparently,
we're the only two mutants.

25:41.400 --> 25:44.000
I didn't come from MI5,
or the police, or the army.

25:44.000 --> 25:44.640
I didn't come from MI5,
or the police, or the army.

25:45.760 --> 25:47.480
I was born with this gift.

25:48.640 --> 25:51.400
You've had it for five minutes.

25:51.440 --> 25:52.000
No. No, we're not the same,

25:52.000 --> 25:54.120
No. No, we're not the same,

25:55.080 --> 25:58.280
and I doubt we'll be working
closely together.

25:58.320 --> 26:00.000
Not for a long while.

26:00.000 --> 26:00.480
Not for a long while.

26:00.520 --> 26:02.800
Well, I can handle it.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.880
You've seen the world end twice.

26:07.920 --> 26:08.000
How was that for you?

26:08.000 --> 26:09.960
How was that for you?

26:10.000 --> 26:12.440
Not very nice.
Not very nice.

26:13.520 --> 26:15.680
It changes a person.

26:16.520 --> 26:19.000
Maybe everyone else
thinks they can deal with it

26:19.040 --> 26:20.600
with a song and a drink,

26:20.640 --> 26:22.920
but eventually,
it catches up with you.

26:22.960 --> 26:24.000
Gets in your head.

26:24.000 --> 26:24.840
Gets in your head.

26:25.560 --> 26:27.440
Are you married?

26:28.440 --> 26:30.560
I'm thinkin' of askin' her.

26:34.880 --> 26:37.520
Not many happy marriages
in Lazarus.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.000
Thank you, cheers. Good chat.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.200
Thank you, cheers. Good chat.

26:42.080 --> 26:43.720
Thank you.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.320
It starts with an earthquake

26:58.120 --> 27:00.480
Listen to yourself churn

27:00.520 --> 27:03.000
Don't mis-serve your own needs

27:03.040 --> 27:04.000
Speed it up a notch, speed, grunt,
No, strength

27:04.000 --> 27:05.240
Speed it up a notch, speed, grunt,
No, strength

27:05.280 --> 27:07.960
With fear of fight, down, height

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Represent the seven games

27:10.040 --> 27:12.000
And a combat site

27:12.000 --> 27:12.320
And a combat site

27:14.160 --> 27:16.640
Breathing down your neck

27:16.680 --> 27:19.120
Population, common group

27:19.160 --> 27:20.000
Save yourself, serve yourself

27:20.000 --> 27:21.080
Save yourself, serve yourself

27:21.120 --> 27:23.560
Listen to your heart bleed

27:23.600 --> 27:26.480
George, have you got the UN Report?

27:26.520 --> 27:28.000
It's already in your inbox, ma'am.
Good man!

27:28.000 --> 27:28.680
It's already in your inbox, ma'am.
Good man!

27:30.360 --> 27:33.880
As we know it

27:39.440 --> 27:41.400
How was work?

27:42.920 --> 27:44.000
Exhaustin'.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Exhaustin'.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.600
Mmm. Love you.

27:57.440 --> 27:58.880
D'you know that?

27:58.920 --> 28:00.000
Mmm... Yeah.
But it's always nice to hear.

28:00.000 --> 28:00.960
Mmm... Yeah.
But it's always nice to hear.

28:04.320 --> 28:07.040
Oh, by the way, Karl's having
a dinner party next week.

28:07.080 --> 28:08.000
And I told him we'd go...

28:08.000 --> 28:09.160
And I told him we'd go...

28:09.200 --> 28:10.800
Uh-oh.

28:11.760 --> 28:14.360
Sure. I'd hate to miss
Karl's dinner party.

28:14.400 --> 28:15.720
Oh!

28:23.520 --> 28:24.000
George!

28:24.000 --> 28:24.960
George!

28:25.000 --> 28:26.800
Glad you could make it.

28:26.840 --> 28:28.760
D'you want a glass of wine?

28:28.800 --> 28:30.160
Just a very big one.

28:30.200 --> 28:31.320
Yeah?
Thanks.

28:34.720 --> 28:36.600
Oh, congrats on the netball,
very cool.

28:36.640 --> 28:39.440
Oh, thank you. And don't forget
the tennis. Oh, of course.

28:39.480 --> 28:40.000
That'll be nationals next week,
and then the third gold this year!

28:40.000 --> 28:43.200
That'll be nationals next week,
and then the third gold this year!

28:43.240 --> 28:45.440
Oh, my... Cheers to that.
Cheers to me.

28:45.480 --> 28:46.920
Thank you very much!
Cheers!

28:48.720 --> 28:50.520
Mmmph!

28:50.560 --> 28:53.160
George. Been meaning
to ask you a question.

28:55.280 --> 28:56.000
I've got a little bit of money
squirrelled away.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.640
I've got a little bit of money
squirrelled away.

28:57.680 --> 29:03.520
It's not much, but, erm, I wondered
if your little, erm, er, app

29:03.560 --> 29:04.000
would recommend any good
investment opportunities.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.720
would recommend any good
investment opportunities.

29:10.360 --> 29:12.000
DeWhitt and Weston.
DeWhitt and...

29:12.000 --> 29:12.600
DeWhitt and Weston.
DeWhitt and...

29:12.640 --> 29:14.440
Weston.
Weston?

29:14.480 --> 29:16.280
Yeah, it's an American firm.

29:16.320 --> 29:18.560
Doing really exciting work
right now, but--

29:18.600 --> 29:20.000
Yeah? Their stock's
still competitively priced, and...

29:20.000 --> 29:21.800
Yeah? Their stock's
still competitively priced, and...

29:21.840 --> 29:24.720
And you think it would be
a good market to get into?

29:24.760 --> 29:26.560
It can't hurt to try.

29:26.600 --> 29:28.000
Yeah. Yeah!

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Yeah. Yeah!

29:29.040 --> 29:30.480
All right!

29:30.520 --> 29:32.040
DeWhitt and Weston.
Yeah! Cheers!

29:32.080 --> 29:33.520
Cheers!

29:55.760 --> 29:57.600
Archie!

29:57.640 --> 30:00.000
The algorithm I was usin'
on the app I was developin',

30:00.000 --> 30:00.760
The algorithm I was usin'
on the app I was developin',

30:01.800 --> 30:04.400
part of its job was to monitor
suspicious activity

30:04.440 --> 30:05.920
in business accounts.

30:05.960 --> 30:08.000
People skimmin' off the top, insider
trading, that kind of thing.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.720
People skimmin' off the top, insider
trading, that kind of thing.

30:11.320 --> 30:14.800
Anyway, erm, it flagged up
an account in Russia

30:14.840 --> 30:16.000
that was bringin' in unusual funds.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
that was bringin' in unusual funds.

30:17.040 --> 30:20.800
So, I got past the encryption and
it turns out that account is linked

30:20.840 --> 30:23.640
to a security company
that was safeguarding Big Boy.

30:23.680 --> 30:24.000
Ma'am, did you see
the last name there?

30:24.000 --> 30:26.040
Ma'am, did you see
the last name there?

30:27.560 --> 30:29.840
Wha... what is it?

30:29.880 --> 30:32.000
It's an account
we believe is linked

30:32.000 --> 30:32.320
It's an account
we believe is linked

30:32.360 --> 30:35.760
to a man called Dennis Rebrov.

30:36.960 --> 30:40.000
He's on almost every terror
watchlist in the world.

30:40.000 --> 30:40.400
He's on almost every terror
watchlist in the world.

30:40.440 --> 30:42.240
He used to have your desk.

30:42.280 --> 30:45.280
What, he's ex-Lazarus?
One of our brightest and best.

30:49.720 --> 30:51.960
Right.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.800
This is a thing now.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.560
Good catch.
Hah, thanks.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.600
No, I mean it, good catch.

31:00.480 --> 31:02.600
Hey, you remember what tonight is?

31:03.720 --> 31:04.000
Yeah, course I do. First
checkpoint as a Lazarus agent.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.560
Yeah, course I do. First
checkpoint as a Lazarus agent.

31:07.880 --> 31:10.160
Hey. Uh, you see...
you see Rebrov, yeah?

31:10.200 --> 31:12.000
He's the only one of us
to have gone bad, right?

31:12.000 --> 31:14.120
He's the only one of us
to have gone bad, right?

31:14.160 --> 31:16.480
No.
There were others.

31:17.720 --> 31:19.560
He's just the worst.

32:00.840 --> 32:03.640
Hi, Miss! Hi, Miss!
Morning!

32:03.680 --> 32:06.200
We're gonna be late!
We're gonna be in trouble!

32:06.240 --> 32:08.000
Your best pal.

32:08.000 --> 32:08.680
Your best pal.

32:10.880 --> 32:13.120
Right, you,
I'll see you later.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.560
Ooo-ooo-ooo!

32:18.600 --> 32:20.400
OK...

32:20.440 --> 32:21.840
Morning!

32:21.880 --> 32:23.800
Hey!

32:23.840 --> 32:24.000
DeWhitt and Weston just tanked.
I don't know what that means.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.680
DeWhitt and Weston just tanked.
I don't know what that means.

32:26.720 --> 32:29.480
George told me to invest in
a company that went belly-up.

32:29.520 --> 32:32.000
I've lost my savings.
I'm sure he didn't-- No, no.

32:32.000 --> 32:32.040
I've lost my savings.
I'm sure he didn't-- No, no.

32:32.080 --> 32:35.160
It's his job to know these things.
He's done it on purpose!

32:35.200 --> 32:38.200
He wouldn't do that. Tell him
I want my fucking money back.

32:38.240 --> 32:40.000
I'm not sure there's
anything he can do.

32:40.000 --> 32:40.280
I'm not sure there's
anything he can do.

32:40.320 --> 32:42.640
Look, let's talk about this
later, OK?

32:42.680 --> 32:44.920
No, I want to talk about it now.
Aah!

32:44.960 --> 32:46.280
Oh...

32:49.640 --> 32:51.720
Ah, Jesus, Sarah. I'm so sorry.

32:53.440 --> 32:56.000
Trying to get her killed, man?
Stop-- What's wrong with you?

32:56.000 --> 32:56.360
Trying to get her killed, man?
Stop-- What's wrong with you?

32:56.400 --> 32:58.760
You could have killed her!
I'm OK.

33:04.320 --> 33:06.560
We'll talk about this later.

33:11.200 --> 33:12.000
You know, I put all my money
into that company, yeah?

33:12.000 --> 33:14.520
You know, I put all my money
into that company, yeah?

33:14.560 --> 33:17.880
Well, that was a dumb thing
for you to do, weren't it?

33:24.640 --> 33:27.400
Rebrov's team
are renting an apartment

33:27.440 --> 33:28.000
in the fifth arrondissement.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.240
in the fifth arrondissement.

33:29.280 --> 33:31.280
We've been monitoring
their movement,

33:31.320 --> 33:33.640
and identified
up to five men and women

33:33.680 --> 33:36.000
entering and exiting
at various times of day.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.120
entering and exiting
at various times of day.

33:37.160 --> 33:38.720
Any sign of Big Boy? Nope.

33:38.760 --> 33:41.040
But one of these people knows
where he is,

33:41.080 --> 33:43.640
and we are going
to go and get them.

33:43.680 --> 33:44.000
I want you suited and booted
and on the plane in the hour.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.840
I want you suited and booted
and on the plane in the hour.

33:46.880 --> 33:48.760
We are going to Paris.

33:53.120 --> 33:54.960
That's you too, George.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.280
Um, I'm not a field agent.

33:57.320 --> 33:58.760
Who told you that?

33:58.800 --> 34:00.000
I just sort of... assumed.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.720
I just sort of... assumed.

34:01.760 --> 34:03.600
Go and grab your stuff.

34:03.640 --> 34:05.520
You're about to pop your cherry.

34:24.440 --> 34:28.320
And, erm, this will be
the point of entry.

35:05.560 --> 35:07.840
What happens now?
They storm the building.

35:08.920 --> 35:11.880
What do we do? Well, I coordinate
the teams from this seat,

35:11.920 --> 35:12.000
and you sit and don't touch
anything from that seat.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.360
and you sit and don't touch
anything from that seat.

35:16.520 --> 35:18.480
Lima four-two in position.

35:21.680 --> 35:24.160
Lima three-five
approaching the side entrance.

35:26.200 --> 35:28.000
Waiting for further
instructions. Over.

35:28.000 --> 35:28.280
Waiting for further
instructions. Over.

35:28.320 --> 35:30.320
Lima four-two, on my signal.
Affirmative.

35:30.360 --> 35:33.120
Done this sort of thing a lot,
right? Mm-hm.

35:34.720 --> 35:36.000
Lima four-two,
enter the building now.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.080
Lima four-two,
enter the building now.

35:40.520 --> 35:43.600
Yeah, I bet you seen
some shit with the Jaeger Corps.

35:43.640 --> 35:44.000
Yeah, I wake up screaming
sometimes.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.320
Yeah, I wake up screaming
sometimes.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
You should probably
talk to someone about that.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.160
You should probably
talk to someone about that.

35:53.200 --> 35:56.560
Entering the first floor
on the southeast side.

35:56.600 --> 35:59.960
Roger. The priority
is retrieving the detonator.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.200
- Affirmative.
- Affirmative.

36:01.240 --> 36:03.400
Approaching the second level now.
Roger.

36:03.440 --> 36:05.840
Lima three-five...
Lima three-five, we've--

36:05.880 --> 36:07.920
Unit One, hold your position.

36:07.960 --> 36:08.000
We've got interference.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.760
We've got interference.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.800
What's going on in there?

36:13.720 --> 36:16.000
OK, we've got visual back.
Motion detected, ground floor.

36:16.000 --> 36:16.120
OK, we've got visual back.
Motion detected, ground floor.

36:16.160 --> 36:18.040
Stand by. Lima four-two,
hold your position.

36:18.080 --> 36:19.680
Lima three-five, we are-

36:19.720 --> 36:20.840
Code red. Hostiles detected.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.360
Multiple hostiles
on the ground floor.

36:22.400 --> 36:24.000
Unit One, move to provide backup.

36:24.000 --> 36:24.120
Unit One, move to provide backup.

36:24.160 --> 36:25.920
Lima four-two, moving now.

36:25.960 --> 36:27.240
Man down.

36:27.280 --> 36:28.560
What's going on?

36:28.600 --> 36:30.560
We've lost the target.
Who's got Rebrov?

36:30.600 --> 36:31.880
Lima four-two?
Negative.

36:36.400 --> 36:38.120
Four-two.
Suspect sighted.

36:38.160 --> 36:40.000
Ground floor...

36:40.000 --> 36:40.320
Ground floor...

36:53.120 --> 36:55.080
I'm going to the basement.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.640
Archie, come in.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.640
I'm hit.

37:19.760 --> 37:20.000
Lima four-two needs backup now.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.720
Lima four-two needs backup now.

37:21.760 --> 37:23.520
Lima three-five, do you read me?

37:23.560 --> 37:25.320
Lima four-two needs backup
right now.

37:25.360 --> 37:27.000
Ar-- Archie?

37:27.040 --> 37:28.000
Hey, no, don't--

37:28.000 --> 37:28.400
Hey, no, don't--

37:42.880 --> 37:44.000
Dane!

37:44.000 --> 37:44.360
Dane!

37:48.160 --> 37:49.440
Jump!

38:01.960 --> 38:03.720
Buckle up!

38:12.240 --> 38:14.080
Lima four-two is dead.

38:14.120 --> 38:15.680
I think Rebrov's got the detonator.

38:15.720 --> 38:16.000
We have local police en route.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.240
We have local police en route.

38:21.760 --> 38:23.280
Oh, shit!

38:25.440 --> 38:28.800
Watch the red light. Watch-- watch
the red light! Watch the red light!

38:32.720 --> 38:35.840
No, watch out, watch out for the--
Watch out for the bus!

38:43.120 --> 38:44.480
Jesus fucking--
Glove compartment!

38:44.520 --> 38:46.840
I thought you told me
not to touch anything.

38:46.880 --> 38:48.000
Well, now I'm saying something
different. Shoot the prick.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.400
Well, now I'm saying something
different. Shoot the prick.

38:52.840 --> 38:55.840
You wanna take a short cut?
No, no!I-- No, I don't...

38:55.880 --> 38:56.000
I-- I really, really, really don't--

38:56.000 --> 38:57.880
I-- I really, really, really don't--

39:08.320 --> 39:11.520
Take a shot, George.
Take a fucking shot, George!

39:38.680 --> 39:41.920
Watch out for the cops, watch out
for-- Watch out for the cops!

39:44.920 --> 39:48.240
I literally said
watch out for the cops!

39:54.840 --> 39:56.840
Get out of the way!

40:22.480 --> 40:24.000
Target down, we're approaching on--

40:24.000 --> 40:24.240
Target down, we're approaching on--

40:34.240 --> 40:35.640
Man down! Man down!

40:35.680 --> 40:37.520
Where's Rebrov?
He's taking cover.

40:44.920 --> 40:47.000
Police are surrounding him!

40:50.120 --> 40:52.360
He's gonna detonate.
Wh-wh-wha-what's happened?

40:52.400 --> 40:55.040
I'm calling it. Code Black.
What?

40:55.080 --> 40:56.000
He's gonna detonate.

40:56.000 --> 40:56.760
He's gonna detonate.

41:34.880 --> 41:36.000
Fuck...

41:36.000 --> 41:36.920
Fuck...

41:36.960 --> 41:38.880
Oh...

41:38.920 --> 41:41.520
Oh...

41:53.320 --> 41:55.560
Hey...
That was fucking shit.

41:55.600 --> 41:57.440
I got shot in the head.

41:57.480 --> 42:00.000
Oh, The Dane told me
you handled yourself well.

42:00.040 --> 42:02.440
It didn't stop the bomb going off,
though, did it?

42:02.480 --> 42:04.320
Yeah, you lose marks for that.

42:04.360 --> 42:05.840
What are we gonna do now?

42:05.880 --> 42:08.000
We'll have people
going to the Paris address now,

42:08.000 --> 42:08.360
We'll have people
going to the Paris address now,

42:08.400 --> 42:09.600
following up some leads.

42:09.640 --> 42:11.480
You should take a day off.

42:11.520 --> 42:14.000
First couple of loops
take it out of you.

42:14.040 --> 42:16.000
If we'd have stopped Rebrov,
you'd have stayed dead.

42:16.000 --> 42:16.960
If we'd have stopped Rebrov,
you'd have stayed dead.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.040
Try not to think about that.

42:20.160 --> 42:21.880
We're gonna get him, though, right?

42:21.920 --> 42:24.000
Thing you've gotta remember
about Rebrov is he's one of us.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.120
Thing you've gotta remember
about Rebrov is he's one of us.

42:25.160 --> 42:26.880
He's aware of the time loops.

42:26.920 --> 42:28.800
He'll know we're coming for him.

42:29.560 --> 42:31.640
Hi, Miss.

42:31.680 --> 42:32.000
Morning!

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Morning!

42:35.360 --> 42:37.280
Shit...

42:37.320 --> 42:39.080
Sorry, babe. I've gotta go.

42:39.120 --> 42:40.000
I thought you had the day off?
Yeah, something came up.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.360
I thought you had the day off?
Yeah, something came up.

42:44.480 --> 42:46.000
You work too hard.

42:46.040 --> 42:47.440
See you later.

42:47.480 --> 42:48.000
Ooo-ooo-ooo!

42:48.000 --> 42:49.920
Ooo-ooo-ooo!

42:49.960 --> 42:51.400
You got Rebrov?

42:51.440 --> 42:53.400
French police raided
the flat first thing

42:53.440 --> 42:54.720
after a tipoff from us.

42:54.760 --> 42:56.000
Picked up some of his guys and they
gave us a location, the grasses.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.120
Picked up some of his guys and they
gave us a location, the grasses.

42:58.160 --> 43:00.520
It's his job to know
when these things happen.

43:00.560 --> 43:03.000
He's done it on purpose.
He wouldn't do that. Listen--

43:03.040 --> 43:04.000
That's fantastic!Yeah.
We're moving on him now.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.440
That's fantastic!Yeah.
We're moving on him now.

43:05.480 --> 43:07.720
Thought you might like
to be here for it.

43:07.760 --> 43:09.880
Yeah, absolutely. I've gotta go.

43:09.920 --> 43:12.000
See you later.- We'll talk
about this later.- No.

43:12.000 --> 43:12.600
See you later.- We'll talk
about this later.- No.
