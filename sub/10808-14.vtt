00:03.070 --> 00:06.062
(theme music playing)

00:19.687 --> 00:24.558
NARRATOR:
Man lives in the sunlit world

00:24.558 --> 00:29.018
of what he believes
to be reality.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.968
But... there is,

00:33.968 --> 00:38.505
unseen by most, an underworld.

00:38.505 --> 00:42.176
A place that is just as real

00:42.176 --> 00:46.280
but not as brightly lit.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.044
A dark side.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.226
(flames crackling)

01:18.078 --> 01:22.071
J‘J‘

01:33.761 --> 01:36.997
...was dreaming.

01:36.997 --> 01:40.601
She's not going to make
it, is she, Dad?

01:40.601 --> 01:42.670
Hush, Jamie, don't say that.

01:42.670 --> 01:46.140
He's right, sweetheart.

01:46.140 --> 01:50.210
He's only saying out loud
what we've all been thinking.

01:50.210 --> 01:52.046
GIRL:
Is she going to die?

01:52.046 --> 01:53.647
Is she really going to die?

01:53.647 --> 01:56.183
Right here in our living room?

01:56.183 --> 01:58.385
We don't know that, honey.

01:58.385 --> 02:01.155
Maybe we should call
Dr. Lenton.

02:01.155 --> 02:03.524
I don't think
there's much point.

02:03.524 --> 02:06.026
You remember what he said.

02:06.026 --> 02:10.793
It's... gettin' dark.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.201
It's late.

02:14.201 --> 02:16.336
You guys better get to bed.

02:16.336 --> 02:17.538
That's right.

02:17.538 --> 02:18.972
Tomorrow's a special day.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.340
We'll go trick-or-treating.

02:20.340 --> 02:22.570
I don't want to go to bed.

02:25.112 --> 02:26.545
Good night, Grandma.

02:36.356 --> 02:38.881
What day is it?

02:40.227 --> 02:43.497
FATHER:
It's Thursday, Grandma.

02:43.497 --> 02:46.600
No.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.837
What date?

02:49.837 --> 02:52.840
It's the 30th of October.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.705
October?

02:56.076 --> 02:57.478
Yes, Great-Grandma.

02:57.478 --> 03:01.615
All Hallows' Even.

03:01.615 --> 03:02.750
MOTHER:
What did she say?

03:02.750 --> 03:04.752
FATHER: What was that
you said, Grandma?

03:04.752 --> 03:10.591
All Hallows' Even.

03:10.591 --> 03:13.060
I'm going to die

03:13.060 --> 03:18.766
on All Hallows' Even.

03:18.766 --> 03:21.735
Richard, what is
she talking about?

03:21.735 --> 03:23.237
Halloween.

03:23.237 --> 03:27.674
They call it "All Hallows' Even"
in Scotland.

03:27.674 --> 03:29.710
MOTHER:
What does she mean?

03:29.710 --> 03:33.013
RICHARD:
I don't know.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.648
It's 11:30.

03:34.648 --> 03:37.549
Half an hour until
All Hallows' Even.

03:38.952 --> 03:41.755
It's time you guys
were in bed.

03:41.755 --> 03:44.191
Good night, Mom.

03:44.191 --> 03:45.592
Good night.

03:45.592 --> 03:47.492
-Good night.
-Good night, Daddy.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.941
(labored breath)

04:09.049 --> 04:11.485
GREAT-GRANDMA:
And down into the cold,

04:11.485 --> 04:14.555
to Mount Bidur
with the other children

04:14.555 --> 04:16.223
to gather for the fires...

04:16.223 --> 04:18.659
(distant bagpipes playing)

04:18.659 --> 04:21.728
...out begging from the folk...
and we would say...

04:21.728 --> 04:26.222
"Give us a peat to burn
the witches, good missus."

04:29.703 --> 04:32.773
Pile it high with wood.

04:32.773 --> 04:37.210
Pile it high with straw
and furs and peat.

04:39.680 --> 04:45.018
And what a beautiful
Samhain it would be.

04:45.018 --> 04:51.184
And the fire burned through
the night on All Hallows' Even.

04:53.227 --> 04:57.755
The fire that kept away
the Cutty Black Sow.

05:02.369 --> 05:08.141
Kept it away from any soul
who died on that witches' night.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.544
Kept the fire burnin',

05:10.544 --> 05:15.382
till the heap had turned
to bright red coals.

05:15.382 --> 05:18.752
And we would gather up
the ash and coals

05:18.752 --> 05:20.520
in the form of a circle...

05:20.520 --> 05:21.521
Great-Gran...

05:21.521 --> 05:24.858
And into it we would put stones.

05:24.858 --> 05:28.595
One mark for each member
of the families.

05:28.595 --> 05:32.833
The stones were our souls,

05:32.833 --> 05:38.138
and as long as they stayed
in the circle of the fire,

05:38.138 --> 05:41.208
Old Cutty Black Sow
would not harm us.

05:41.208 --> 05:45.112
And in the mornin',
everyone would run

05:45.112 --> 05:50.183
to make sure that not a stone
was disturbed or missing.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.719
For if it was,

05:52.719 --> 05:57.858
the soul that stood for that
missing stone would be took

05:57.858 --> 06:01.328
(echoing):
by the Cutty Black Sow.

06:01.328 --> 06:02.488
The Cutty Black what?

06:03.230 --> 06:04.564
Take care, Jamie!

06:04.564 --> 06:07.234
You are the one
who must take care!

06:07.234 --> 06:10.971
(distant bagpipes playing)

06:10.971 --> 06:13.240
lwill, Great-Gran, I will.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.875
Hurry now,

06:14.875 --> 06:17.571
and kiss me good night.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.149
But Great-Gran, who...?

06:22.149 --> 06:23.548
What is the Cutty Black...?

06:29.523 --> 06:31.388
Great-G ran? Great-G ran?

06:42.169 --> 06:43.437
She's dead.

06:43.437 --> 06:46.473
Great-Gran is dead, isn't she?

06:46.473 --> 06:51.078
Yes, Jamie,
your great-gran's dead.

06:51.078 --> 06:54.815
She lived
a very full life, Jamie,

06:54.815 --> 06:58.885
and that's what we always
have to remember.

06:58.885 --> 07:01.755
It's what Great-Gran'd
want us to remember.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.558
Her whole lost world...

07:04.558 --> 07:08.528
her history, our history.

07:08.528 --> 07:12.766
See, we always have
to remember.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.736
And now that she's gone, uh...

07:15.736 --> 07:19.239
it's up to us
to keep her alive.

07:19.239 --> 07:24.978
Her memory, and everything
that... that she was.

07:24.978 --> 07:27.114
I'll always remember
Great-Gran.

07:27.114 --> 07:30.317
I know you will, Jamie.

07:30.317 --> 07:32.486
So will I.

07:32.486 --> 07:35.683
I better go get your mom.

07:43.597 --> 07:49.803
(distant bagpipes playing)

07:49.803 --> 07:51.794
(crying)

07:55.776 --> 07:57.944
GREAT-GRANDMA (over tape):
...with the other children

07:57.944 --> 08:00.647
to gather for the fires...

08:00.647 --> 08:05.352
out begging from the folk...
and we would say...

08:05.352 --> 08:10.991
"Give us a peat to burn
the witches, good missus."

08:10.991 --> 08:15.162
And the fire would burn
through the night

08:15.162 --> 08:17.164
on All Hallows' Even.

08:17.164 --> 08:22.002
The fire that kept away
the Cutty Black Sow.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.492
(turns off tape player)

08:25.939 --> 08:27.174
"Cutty...

08:27.174 --> 08:29.476
"Scottish dialect.

08:29.476 --> 08:33.139
Short bristles cut or shaven."

08:40.387 --> 08:42.889
"Catherine Martha Mattock.

08:42.889 --> 08:45.881
"June 1, 1888.

08:47.894 --> 08:51.865
"Married James Malcolm MacEvans.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.856
"January 5, 1910.

09:09.683 --> 09:13.453
"Died October 30."

09:13.453 --> 09:14.442
No.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.494
She died on All Hallows' Even.

09:20.494 --> 09:22.485
October 31.

09:34.307 --> 09:38.278
"They shall hear his hooves beat
upon the threshold.

09:38.278 --> 09:41.281
"And then they shall hear
the breath of Hell

09:41.281 --> 09:43.517
"in his black throat.

09:43.517 --> 09:47.287
"The Cutty Black Sow shall come
on All Hallows' Even

09:47.287 --> 09:49.789
to devour and destroy."

09:49.789 --> 09:51.780
(bagpipes playing)

10:19.352 --> 10:22.689
CATHERINE: And into that circle
we would put stones.

10:22.689 --> 10:26.693
One mark for each member
of our families.

10:26.693 --> 10:30.964
The stones were our souls.

10:30.964 --> 10:35.268
And as long as they stayed
inside the circle of the fire...

10:35.268 --> 10:36.269
What are you doing?

10:36.269 --> 10:37.337
Nothing.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.405
CATHERINE:
...OId Cutty Black Sow...

10:38.405 --> 10:40.106
Well, I want to go
trick-or-treating.

10:40.106 --> 10:41.708
Mommy said you're supposed
to take me,

10:41.708 --> 10:44.110
even if Great-Grandma
did die last night.

10:44.110 --> 10:46.813
Okay, okay, but there's
something I have to do first.

10:46.813 --> 10:47.948
What is it?

10:47.948 --> 10:49.316
About Great-Grandma?

10:49.316 --> 10:51.484
Don't worry, I'll take
you trick-or-treating.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.154
Soon as I'm done taking care
of Great-Grandma.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.855
But she's already dead.

10:55.855 --> 10:58.058
And Mommy says her funeral
is tomorrow.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.327
I'm not talking
about her funeral.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.996
Before Great-Grandma died,
she asked me to do something.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.065
Sort of like a last request.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.366
Can I help?

11:06.366 --> 11:08.068
l have a magic wand.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.869
But it only does evil magic.

11:09.869 --> 11:11.838
First, you have to swear
not to tell anyone--

11:11.838 --> 11:13.640
not Mommy, not Daddy,
not anyone.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.175
I swear.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.110
I need five stones.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.008
Rocks?

11:18.712 --> 11:20.714
About that big around

11:20.714 --> 11:23.617
and... flat on both sides.

11:23.617 --> 11:24.948
Okay.

11:28.154 --> 11:30.490
(over tape player):
...could not harm you.

11:30.490 --> 11:33.226
And in the morning,
everyone would run...

11:33.226 --> 11:35.562
Jamie.

11:35.562 --> 11:36.863
We're leaving.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.854
Come on down, say good-bye.

11:41.735 --> 11:45.171
We'll be at the funeral parlor
if you need us, honey.

11:45.171 --> 11:47.007
Sure you don't want me
to come with you?

11:47.007 --> 11:49.809
You and Gloria go out
and have a good time.

11:49.809 --> 11:52.712
But don't eat
all the candy tonight.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.015
Try not to worry
about anything, okay?

11:55.015 --> 11:58.852
Just be a good big brother and
take Gloria trick-or-treating.

11:58.852 --> 12:01.421
But be back before dark.

12:01.421 --> 12:04.190
I don't want the two of you
roaming around alone at night.

12:04.190 --> 12:05.452
RICHARD:
Have a good time, hon.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.969
JAMIE: "Into that circle,
you will put stones.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.271
"One mark for each member
of our families.

12:18.271 --> 12:21.207
"As long as they stayed inside
the circle of fire,

12:21.207 --> 12:23.743
Old Cutty Black Sow
could not harm them."

12:23.743 --> 12:25.478
I got the rocks.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.614
Can't we go
trick-or-treating now?

12:27.614 --> 12:28.448
(growls)

12:28.448 --> 12:29.346
(gasps)

12:30.884 --> 12:33.682
I'm gonna pay you back
for scaring me.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.379
Sure.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.196
Come on.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.629
Where?

13:01.081 --> 13:02.182
This one's for you.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.742
"G" for Gloria.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.826
GLORIA:
"M" for Mommy.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.817
Marion.

13:17.831 --> 13:19.265
GLORIA:
Richard.

13:19.265 --> 13:20.266
That's Daddy.

13:20.266 --> 13:21.301
Now do yours.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.359
"J" for Jamie.

13:24.671 --> 13:28.041
Who's the last one for?

13:28.041 --> 13:29.275
Great-Grandma.

13:29.275 --> 13:31.010
But she's already dead.

13:31.010 --> 13:33.279
"C" for Catherine.

13:33.279 --> 13:34.848
It's not too late.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.116
We still have to protect her.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.549
We still have
to protect her soul.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.355
I'm scared.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.491
Are we safe now?

13:44.491 --> 13:45.658
lthink so.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.026
I hope so.

13:47.026 --> 13:48.595
Good, then let's
get out of here.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.497
I want to go trick-or-treating.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.598
All right, in a minute.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.099
I just have to get dressed.

13:53.099 --> 13:55.897
(distant bagpipes playing)

14:01.441 --> 14:03.068
(quiet sizzling, hissing)

14:14.320 --> 14:16.311
(stones, fire crackling)

14:20.427 --> 14:23.463
I counted at least
four chocolate chews

14:23.463 --> 14:27.233
and...
three peanut clusters.

14:27.233 --> 14:29.502
Trade you a chocolate chew
for a peanut cluster.

14:29.502 --> 14:30.904
Sure!

14:30.904 --> 14:33.395
Look, Jamie,
there's a piece over there.

14:36.643 --> 14:39.412
Jamie, one of the stones fell.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.381
Don't touch that!

14:41.381 --> 14:42.882
(Gloria screams, glass shatters)

14:42.882 --> 14:44.584
It was hot.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.554
Mommy is going to be
so mad at us.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.989
(wind whistling)

14:49.989 --> 14:51.224
(thumping)

14:51.224 --> 14:52.325
What was that?

14:52.325 --> 14:54.527
Jamie, stop it.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.196
First you break Mommy's lamp,

14:56.196 --> 14:58.131
and now you're trying
to scare me.

14:58.131 --> 14:59.766
It's time for bed, Gloria.

14:59.766 --> 15:02.001
It is not, and I don't have to.

15:02.001 --> 15:03.069
You do.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.571
Upstairs now, Gloria.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.973
Jamie, you're scaring me.

15:06.973 --> 15:09.409
You were a good witch tonight.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.778
l was really scary.

15:11.778 --> 15:12.979
Yeah.

15:12.979 --> 15:14.647
Okay, I'll go.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.516
Good night.

15:16.516 --> 15:17.676
Night.

15:21.855 --> 15:25.458
CATHERINE: The soul that stood
for that missing stone

15:25.458 --> 15:28.621
would be took
by the Cutty Black Sow.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.095
JAMIE:
It's me.

15:32.131 --> 15:33.700
It's me.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.001
What'd you say?

15:35.001 --> 15:36.870
-Nothing.
-Tuck me in.

15:36.870 --> 15:38.271
Okay?

15:38.271 --> 15:40.640
(thumping)

15:40.640 --> 15:42.232
I'll be right up.

15:57.490 --> 16:00.516
(thumping, wind whistling)

16:01.561 --> 16:04.230
(quiet footsteps)

16:04.230 --> 16:07.256
(low growling)

16:11.538 --> 16:13.529
(branches scraping window)

16:19.979 --> 16:21.844
(growling)

16:36.896 --> 16:38.523
(growling)

16:44.837 --> 16:46.532
(sharp thud)

16:53.580 --> 16:54.569
(thudding)

16:55.782 --> 16:59.309
(growling)

17:01.854 --> 17:03.845
(phone ringing)

17:05.692 --> 17:07.393
Hello? Hello?

17:07.393 --> 17:08.561
Who is this?

17:08.561 --> 17:10.730
MARION: Jamie?
What on earth is going on there?

17:10.730 --> 17:12.865
You sound terrible.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.200
Nothing, nothing, Mom.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.301
How are you?

17:15.301 --> 17:16.569
ls Gloria in bed?

17:16.569 --> 17:18.738
Are you two all right?

17:18.738 --> 17:19.906
Gloria's asleep.

17:19.906 --> 17:21.341
We're fine.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.509
You're sure, now?

17:23.509 --> 17:24.711
Yeah.

17:24.711 --> 17:25.878
Just come home soon, okay?

17:25.878 --> 17:28.815
Just hurry home, please.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.806
(flames crackling softly,
wind whistling)

17:42.395 --> 17:44.964
(thumping)

17:44.964 --> 17:46.955
That was not the wind.

17:52.271 --> 17:54.262
(branches tapping)

17:59.312 --> 18:01.143
Gloria?

18:02.181 --> 18:03.273
Gloria?

18:13.588 --> 18:15.995
(muffled roaring)

18:15.995 --> 18:17.697
You're supposed to be in bed.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.198
Well, I had to pay you back.

18:19.198 --> 18:21.223
You did,
so now go back to sleep.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.634
All right.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.665
(wind whistling softly)

18:32.612 --> 18:35.604
(quiet clicking)

18:42.655 --> 18:44.157
(distant bagpipes playing)

18:44.157 --> 18:45.351
(door creaks)

18:47.794 --> 18:49.629
Mommy, Daddy,
I'm so glad to see you.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.621
Were you expecting
somebody else?

18:55.334 --> 18:56.602
(sighs)

18:56.602 --> 18:59.305
Is everything all right?

18:59.305 --> 19:00.473
Oh, no.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.997
What happened to my lamp?

19:04.010 --> 19:05.178
JAMIE:
It was an accident.

19:05.178 --> 19:06.579
I broke it. I'm sorry.

19:06.579 --> 19:09.309
It's been an awful day
for everybody.

19:12.218 --> 19:15.555
Jamie, are you sure
you're all right?

19:15.555 --> 19:16.989
I'm fine, Mom, don't worry.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.092
MARION: You can tell me all
about the lamp tomorrow.

19:19.092 --> 19:21.360
Give me a kiss good night.

19:21.360 --> 19:22.361
JAMIE:
Good night.

19:22.361 --> 19:23.930
Night, Daddy.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.921
Good night, Jamie.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.938
(thunder rumbling)

19:31.938 --> 19:33.929
(rain pattering)

20:06.606 --> 20:09.242
(thunder cracks, Jamie screams)

20:09.242 --> 20:12.278
(distant bagpipes playing)

20:12.278 --> 20:13.267
(screams)

20:14.080 --> 20:16.415
Oh, Dad, it's you.

20:16.415 --> 20:17.717
Jamie, it's okay.

20:17.717 --> 20:18.885
I'm here.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.954
Well, look out the window, Dad.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.389
(thunder rumbling)

20:23.389 --> 20:25.925
Jamie, there's-there's
nothing out there.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.493
(growling)

20:27.493 --> 20:29.529
Dad, Great-Grandma
told me this story.

20:29.529 --> 20:32.265
She wanted me to protect her
soul from the Cutty Black Sow.

20:32.265 --> 20:35.735
Jamie, she knew
a whole lifetime of stories.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.804
But Dad, I read about it
in the dictionary,

20:37.804 --> 20:39.672
and I hear it, and I saw it.

20:39.672 --> 20:43.609
Jamie, it's almost midnight.

20:43.609 --> 20:45.577
Now, no more stories.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.081
Ow!

20:49.081 --> 20:50.070
(growling)

20:51.818 --> 20:53.217
(growling, thunder cracks)

20:59.025 --> 21:00.660
(growling)

21:00.660 --> 21:02.628
(distant bagpipes playing)

21:19.879 --> 21:23.683
NARRATOR:
The dark side is always there.

21:23.683 --> 21:26.219
Waiting for us to enter.

21:26.219 --> 21:29.455
Waiting to enter us.

21:29.455 --> 21:36.019
Until next time, try
to enjoy the daylight.
