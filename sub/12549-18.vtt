WEBVTT

00:06.797 --> 00:08.339
PREVIOUSLY ON "TWISTED"...

00:08.339 --> 00:09.760
THERE'S BEEN A CAR ACCIDENT.
IT'S VIKRAM.

00:09.760 --> 00:10.931
I'M SORRY,
BUT HE'S DEAD.

00:10.931 --> 00:12.843
SOMEONE MOVED HIS BODY.
PUT IT IN THAT CAR.

00:12.843 --> 00:14.725
IS SOMEONE
TRYING TO PROTECT US?

00:14.725 --> 00:16.977
NIGHTS HAVE BEEN BELOW
THE 30s THIS LAST WEEK,
HAVEN'T THEY?

00:16.977 --> 00:18.979
IT'S AWFULLY COLD TO BE
DRIVING WITH YOUR WINDOW DOWN.

00:18.979 --> 00:20.191
- HOW ARE YOU DOING, JACK?
- DANNY.

00:20.191 --> 00:22.233
YOU REMEMBER WHITNEY, RIGHT?
MY LITTLE GIRL.

00:22.233 --> 00:24.024
- I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU.
- LACEY.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.946
DO YOU MIND SHOWING HER
AROUND?

00:25.946 --> 00:27.818
- SURE.
- LEAD ON, MY STUDENT GUIDE.

00:27.818 --> 00:30.030
BEFORE JO,
I HAD ANOTHER BABY.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.783
MAYBE FINDING THAT CHILD
WILL HELP US FIND
OUR WAY BACK.

00:32.783 --> 00:34.245
WHEN I CAME
TO GREEN GROVE,

00:34.245 --> 00:35.826
I WAS COMING FROM JUVIE.

00:35.826 --> 00:37.788
- DID YOU KNOW DANNY?
- HE SWORE TO ME THAT

00:37.788 --> 00:40.371
ONCE HE GOT OUT,
HE WOULD FIND HIS DAD

00:40.371 --> 00:41.922
AND KILL HIM.

00:41.922 --> 00:43.624
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG?

00:43.624 --> 00:45.336
- I KILLED MY DAD!
- IF IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE,

00:45.336 --> 00:46.877
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST COME FORWARD?

00:46.877 --> 00:48.799
I TOLD LACEY THE TRUTH
ABOUT MY DAD.

00:48.799 --> 00:51.932
WE BROKE UP.
SHE SAID THAT THERE'S
SOMETHING BETWEEN US.

00:51.932 --> 00:53.224
HAVEN'T YOU
LIED TO ME ENOUGH?

00:53.224 --> 00:55.346
- YOU WERE THERE, I DIDN'T--
- YOU MANIPULATED ME.

00:55.346 --> 00:57.098
AND I COVERED
FOR YOU, DANNY.

00:57.098 --> 00:59.019
NO WONDER
YOU ARE SO WORRIED

00:59.019 --> 01:01.892
ABOUT BECOMING YOUR DAD--
YOU ARE JUST LIKE HIM.

01:04.645 --> 01:08.899
♪ YOU WIN,
I GIVE UP... ♪

01:08.899 --> 01:12.903
( tires squealing )

01:12.903 --> 01:14.615
( rock music continues
through radio )

01:14.615 --> 01:16.197
( car door closes )

01:16.197 --> 01:17.328
YO, MAN.
WHAT'S UP?

01:17.328 --> 01:18.539
WHY'D YOU DO IT?

01:18.539 --> 01:21.372
- CALM DOWN.
- WHY DID YOU TELL HER?

01:21.372 --> 01:22.963
TELL WHO?

01:22.963 --> 01:24.625
YOU KNOW WHO-- JO.

01:24.625 --> 01:26.837
YOU TOLD HER
I WANTED TO KILL MY DAD?

01:26.837 --> 01:28.169
THAT I TALKED ABOUT IT
IN JUVIE?

01:28.169 --> 01:30.711
WELL, YOU DID
TALK ABOUT IT.

01:30.711 --> 01:33.424
WHAT DOES IT MATTER?
I MEAN, YOUR DAD--
HE DIED IN THE CAR WRECK.

01:33.424 --> 01:35.015
I'M DONE SCREWING
AROUND WITH YOU, CHARLIE.

01:35.015 --> 01:37.428
LOOK, WHEN I TOLD HER
ABOUT JUVIE,

01:37.428 --> 01:39.220
IT JUST CAME OUT, OKAY?

01:39.220 --> 01:41.812
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T
MEAN TO SCREW THINGS UP
FOR THE TWO OF YOU.

01:41.812 --> 01:44.605
I THINK YOU DID.

01:44.605 --> 01:47.318
WELL...
SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

01:48.989 --> 01:50.401
I'LL TALK TO JO.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.193
AND I'LL JUST TELL HER
THAT EVERYTHING YOU SAID
IN JUVIE WAS--

01:52.193 --> 01:54.325
NO. DON'T TALK
TO JO ABOUT ME.

01:54.325 --> 01:56.116
EVER AGAIN.
YOU GOT IT?

01:58.118 --> 02:01.121
YEAH. GOT IT.

02:10.381 --> 02:13.384
( theme music playing )

02:25.396 --> 02:27.898
OH, CRAP.
I FELL ASLEEP.

02:27.898 --> 02:30.821
I GOTTA GET BACK
BEFORE WHITNEY WAKES UP.

02:30.821 --> 02:32.823
AWW, FIVE MORE MINUTES.

02:32.823 --> 02:35.406
I'VE ALREADY CALLED
AND TOLD HER YOU WERE
GOING TO BE LATE.

02:35.406 --> 02:37.037
NOT THIS LATE.

02:37.037 --> 02:39.200
( door opens )

02:39.200 --> 02:42.373
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE
SHACKED UP HERE.

02:42.373 --> 02:43.784
FUN NIGHT?

02:47.588 --> 02:48.919
SO, WHITNEY,

02:48.919 --> 02:51.592
IT'S YOUR FIRST DAY
AT GREEN GROVE HIGH, HUH?

02:52.593 --> 02:54.004
YOU NERVOUS?

02:54.004 --> 02:55.095
NOT REALLY.

02:55.095 --> 02:56.967
THIS IS LIKE MY FOURTH SCHOOL,
SO I GOT IT DOWN.

02:56.967 --> 02:57.928
YEAH.

02:57.928 --> 03:00.511
WHITNEY'S GREAT
AT MAKING FRIENDS, RIGHT?

03:00.511 --> 03:02.062
JUST LIKE MY DADDY.

03:04.265 --> 03:06.857
- EXCUSE ME.
- SORRY.

03:06.857 --> 03:08.229
THAT'S OKAY.
WELL, UH...

03:08.229 --> 03:10.731
YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAVE
TROUBLE FINDING YOUR CLASSROOM

03:10.731 --> 03:12.022
OR, YOU KNOW, ANYTHING,

03:12.022 --> 03:14.575
I'M SURE DANNY COULD HELP YOU.
RIGHT, DANNY?

03:14.575 --> 03:17.197
I DO KNOW WHERE
THE CLASSROOMS ARE.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.660
I WILL BE FINE. I'VE ALREADY
MET SOME REALLY COOL PEOPLE.

03:19.660 --> 03:21.782
LIKE LACEY.
DANNY'S EX.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.035
EX?

03:25.035 --> 03:27.788
YEAH. IT'S FINE.

03:27.788 --> 03:29.670
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

03:29.670 --> 03:31.962
UH, DANNY, HOW'S SOCCER?

03:31.962 --> 03:33.674
IT'S GOOD.
YEAH, IT'S GOING GOOD.

03:33.674 --> 03:35.045
I'M ACTUALLY
GOING TO HEAD IN.

03:35.045 --> 03:36.837
I GOT THIS TRIG TEST
I NEED TO STUDY FOR.

03:36.837 --> 03:38.969
MOM, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

03:38.969 --> 03:40.511
SURE.

03:40.511 --> 03:42.683
BYE, GUYS.

03:42.683 --> 03:44.845
( mouths )

03:44.845 --> 03:46.937
I'M SORRY YOU
HAD TO FIND OUT

03:46.937 --> 03:48.188
ABOUT ME AND JACK
THIS WAY, BUT--

03:48.188 --> 03:51.111
LOOK, I TOLD LACEY.

03:51.111 --> 03:52.813
OH, MY GOD.

03:52.813 --> 03:55.946
- AND THEN SHE--
- SHE BROKE UP WITH ME, YEAH.

03:55.946 --> 03:58.118
WELL, DID YOU EXPLAIN
THAT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT?

03:58.118 --> 03:59.280
- I MEAN, DID YOU
TELL HER THAT--
- TRUST ME.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.161
SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING NOW.

04:01.161 --> 04:03.123
BUT SHE'S NOT
GOING TO TELL ANYONE.

04:03.123 --> 04:04.495
THEY MAY BE MAD AT ME,

04:04.495 --> 04:05.826
BUT THEY DON'T WANT ME
TO GO TO JAIL.

04:05.826 --> 04:07.828
- "THEY"?
- YEAH, JO'S NOT EXACTLY

04:07.828 --> 04:09.420
IN MY CORNER
RIGHT NOW, EITHER.

04:09.420 --> 04:11.171
( sighs )

04:11.171 --> 04:13.794
SHE ACCUSED ME
OF BEING LIKE DAD.

04:13.794 --> 04:17.007
WELL, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
YOU'RE NOTHING LIKE HIM.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.970
I GUESS NOT.

04:19.970 --> 04:21.051
IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO BE HIM,

04:21.051 --> 04:23.053
THEN DON'T BE HIM.
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

04:25.936 --> 04:27.938
LET'S ROLL, FUTURE STEPBRO.

04:27.938 --> 04:29.940
CAN'T BE LATE
ON MY FIRST DAY.

04:35.396 --> 04:37.197
( school bell rings )

04:38.198 --> 04:40.901
HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

04:40.901 --> 04:42.032
FINE.

04:42.032 --> 04:46.076
I, UH... I HEARD THAT
YOU AND DANNY BROKE UP.

04:48.869 --> 04:50.541
WORD TRAVELS FAST.

04:50.541 --> 04:52.082
YEAH.

04:52.082 --> 04:53.874
I'M JUST REALLY SORRY.

04:53.874 --> 04:55.966
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO BE
SORRY FOR?

04:55.966 --> 04:58.339
JUST... THAT IT HAPPENED.

04:58.339 --> 05:01.091
AND THAT YOU'RE HURTING.

05:01.091 --> 05:03.013
BUT HONESTLY, I THINK
YOU'RE BETTER OFF.

05:03.013 --> 05:05.015
I MEAN,
WE'RE BOTH BETTER OFF.

05:05.015 --> 05:06.727
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.

05:06.727 --> 05:07.888
OKAY,YOU'RE RIGHT.
I AGREE.

05:07.888 --> 05:10.270
I JUST...

05:10.270 --> 05:13.354
IF YOU DO WANT SOMEONE
TO LISTEN,

05:13.354 --> 05:14.985
OR HANG OUT WITH,

05:14.985 --> 05:16.607
I'M HERE, OKAY?

05:16.607 --> 05:17.818
GOOD TO KNOW.

05:22.903 --> 05:25.035
THAT LOOKED TENSE.
GIRL TROUBLE?

05:25.035 --> 05:27.538
IT'S NOTHING. HOW'S YOUR
FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL GOING?

05:27.538 --> 05:29.370
WELL, THE FIRST 10 MINUTES
HAVE BEEN AMAZING.

05:29.370 --> 05:32.913
IT'S LIKE I'VE BEEN
A GREEN GROVE GRIZZLY
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

05:32.913 --> 05:35.215
IT'S IMPORTANT TO EMBRACE
THE SCHOOL MASCOT.

05:35.215 --> 05:37.087
IT WAS A GRASSHOPPER
AT MY LAST SCHOOL,

05:37.087 --> 05:39.840
SO THIS IS DEFINITELY
AN UPGRADE.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.962
YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

05:41.962 --> 05:44.425
I-- I'M GREAT.
I'M JUST LATE FOR MUSIC CLASS.

05:44.425 --> 05:45.766
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND,
WHITNEY.

05:45.766 --> 05:47.848
HOPE SO.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.891
AND THEN PRINCIPAL TANG
STARTED ACTING ALL
CONDESCENDING, LIKE--

05:50.891 --> 05:52.933
"DON'T TAKE ON MORE THAN
YOU CAN CHEW, YOUNG LADY."

05:52.933 --> 05:54.895
- HE CALLED YOU "YOUNG LADY"?
- NO.

05:54.895 --> 05:57.357
I ADDED THAT PART.
BUT IT WAS IN HIS TONE.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.531
I MEAN, GOVERNMENT
IS ALL ABOUT BITING OFF
MORE THAN YOU CAN CHEW.

06:00.531 --> 06:02.983
- YEAH.
- WOULD F.D.R. HAVE COME
UP WITH THE NEW DEAL

06:02.983 --> 06:04.445
IF HE WAS CHEWING
THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT?

06:04.445 --> 06:06.326
NO, HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
JUST SAT IN HIS WHEELCHAIR

06:06.326 --> 06:07.908
AND, YOU KNOW, PLAYED
BOARD GAMES AND STUFF.

06:07.908 --> 06:10.541
EXACTLY. I HAVE TO STRIKE
WHILE THE IRON'S HOT.

06:10.541 --> 06:12.993
YOU'RE SO AWESOME.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
SUCH A KICKASS PRESIDENT.

06:12.993 --> 06:14.995
THANKS, RICO.

06:14.995 --> 06:16.707
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:16.707 --> 06:17.998
I'M FEELING
KIND OF OVERWHELMED.

06:17.998 --> 06:19.630
WELL, HEY, LET ME
TAKE YOU OUT TONIGHT.

06:19.630 --> 06:21.261
GIVE THAT PRESIDENTIAL
BRAIN A REST.

06:21.261 --> 06:22.883
IT'S FOOD TRUCK NIGHT IN TOWN.
WE CAN EAT.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.885
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,
GO BACK TO MY PLACE

06:24.885 --> 06:25.966
AND WATCH A MOVIE
OR SOMETHING.

06:25.966 --> 06:28.769
I DON'T KNOW,
I HAVE SO MUCH GOING ON.

06:28.769 --> 06:30.891
OH, COME ON.
EVEN PRESIDENTS NEED TO RELAX.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.062
WHY DO YOU THINK
THEY BUILT CAMP DAVID?

06:32.062 --> 06:33.474
PLUS, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
MY LOFT YET.

06:33.474 --> 06:35.606
THAT'S TRUE.
I HAVEN'T.

06:35.606 --> 06:38.018
SO IS IT A DATE?

06:38.018 --> 06:40.571
IT'S A DATE.

06:40.571 --> 06:42.483
I'M LATE FOR A CLASS.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

06:45.986 --> 06:47.988
I DON'T GET IT.
NOW YOU WANT AN "F"?

06:47.988 --> 06:50.701
NO, I JUST WANT WHAT I
DESERVE-- WHATEVER IT IS.

06:50.701 --> 06:53.163
- IT'S AN "F."
- OKAY, FINE.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.875
FAIL ME.

06:54.875 --> 06:56.917
AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE
THE EQUIPMENT BACK,
I SWEAR.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.539
DONATING ALL THAT STUFF
FOR A GRADE,

06:58.539 --> 07:00.000
IT WASN'T ME.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.592
THAT'S NOT THE KIND
OF PERSON I WANT TO BE.

07:01.592 --> 07:03.173
YOU REALLY WANT ME
TO GIVE YOU AN "F"?

07:03.173 --> 07:04.715
I'LL TAKE A MAKE-UP TEST.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.807
I'LL DO EXTRA CREDIT WORK.
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

07:06.807 --> 07:08.809
I'M BRINGING MY GRADE
BACK UP.

07:08.809 --> 07:11.351
AND THIS TIME,
I'M EARNING IT.

07:11.351 --> 07:13.644
( school bell rings )

07:14.815 --> 07:16.016
HEY!

07:16.016 --> 07:17.017
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

07:17.017 --> 07:19.650
OH, HERE I AM.

07:19.650 --> 07:21.231
SOMEONE FOLLOWING YOU?

07:21.231 --> 07:23.193
WHAT? NO, NO.
NO, I JUST--

07:23.193 --> 07:25.365
WOW, SOMEONE'S REALLY
LOST THEIR COOL, HUH?

07:26.947 --> 07:28.659
SERIOUSLY, WHAT--
WHAT IS IT?

07:28.659 --> 07:31.832
UM, DANNY KIND OF...

07:31.832 --> 07:34.244
FOUND ME LAST NIGHT,
AND HE, UH...

07:34.244 --> 07:35.746
WHAT HAPPENED?

07:35.746 --> 07:37.748
LET'S JUST SAY
HE WASN'T TOO THRILLED THAT

07:37.748 --> 07:39.459
I TOLD YOU WHAT I TOLD YOU.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.211
BUT IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

07:41.211 --> 07:42.583
DID HE THREATEN YOU?

07:44.004 --> 07:45.676
MAYBE A LITTLE.

07:45.676 --> 07:47.548
BUT IT'S JUST GUY STUFF.

07:47.548 --> 07:48.679
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID
ANYTHING.

07:48.679 --> 07:50.350
NO, I'M REALLY GLAD
THAT YOU DID.

07:50.350 --> 07:51.762
I'M SORRY
THAT HE DID THAT.

07:51.762 --> 07:53.183
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, JO.

07:53.183 --> 07:54.895
I KNOW, BUT...

07:54.895 --> 07:57.477
DANNY AND I,
WE HAVE...

07:57.477 --> 07:58.769
OUR OWN STUFF,
AND I JUST--

07:58.769 --> 07:59.980
I SHOULDN'T HAVE PUT YOU
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.862
I KNOW HOW YOU CAN
MAKE IT UP TO ME.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.364
LET ME TAKE YOU
OUT TONIGHT.

08:06.867 --> 08:10.240
WELL, THAT'S THE LAST ADOPTION
AGENCY I COULD FIND.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.782
MAYBE VIKRAM TOOK CARE
OF IT PRIVATELY.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.914
MAYBE. DID HE SAY
ANYTHING ELSE TO YOU?

08:13.914 --> 08:15.956
TELL YOU ANYTHING AT ALL?

08:15.956 --> 08:17.878
NO. I DIDN'T WANT
TO KNOW ANYTHING.

08:17.878 --> 08:19.960
I TRUSTED HIM.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.882
( scoffs )
YEAH.

08:21.882 --> 08:23.043
THAT'S PRETTY CLEAR.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.927
IT WAS YOUR IDEA
TO DO THIS, KYLE.

08:26.927 --> 08:27.928
I KNOW.

08:27.928 --> 08:29.550
DO YOU REALLY WANT
TO HELP ME?

08:29.550 --> 08:30.841
OR JUST MAKE ME FEEL WORSE?

08:30.841 --> 08:32.633
- TESS...
- NO, IT'S FINE.

08:32.633 --> 08:34.264
I HAVE TO GO.

08:38.979 --> 08:41.351
EVERYTHING OKAY?

08:41.351 --> 08:42.983
YEAH, FINE.

08:42.983 --> 08:45.445
ANY UPDATES ON GREEN GROVE'S
NEWEST MILLIONAIRE?

08:45.445 --> 08:48.989
WELL, SHE HAD AN INTERESTING
GUEST LAST NIGHT.

08:48.989 --> 08:50.320
AND THIS MORNING.

08:51.912 --> 08:53.363
THAT BOAT GUY, JACK--

08:53.363 --> 08:54.745
THE ONE WHO USED
TO WORK FOR VIKRAM--

08:54.745 --> 08:55.956
STAYED THE ENTIRE NIGHT.

08:55.956 --> 08:58.579
REALLY?

09:03.964 --> 09:06.797
SO NOW YOU'RE
THREATENING CHARLIE?

09:06.797 --> 09:09.549
IS THAT WHAT HE SAID?

09:09.549 --> 09:11.131
THAT I THREATENED HIM?

09:11.131 --> 09:12.723
YEAH, DANNY, BUT HE
DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO.

09:12.723 --> 09:13.884
HE WAS TOTALLY FREAKED OUT.

09:13.884 --> 09:15.976
LOOK, WHAT HE TOLD YOU
LAST NIGHT...

09:15.976 --> 09:17.728
ABOUT ME
AND MY DAD, IT WAS--

09:17.728 --> 09:19.730
- WAS THE TRUTH?
- IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

09:19.730 --> 09:22.022
DID YOU SAY IT?

09:22.022 --> 09:24.104
DID YOU TALK IN JUVIE
ABOUT KILLING YOUR DAD?

09:24.104 --> 09:25.986
YES.

09:25.986 --> 09:28.899
BUT IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
THAN CHARLIE MADE IT SOUND.

09:28.899 --> 09:31.652
YOU USED ME.
YOU PLANNED ALL OF IT.

09:31.652 --> 09:32.953
YOU CAN'T REALLY
BELIEVE THAT.

09:32.953 --> 09:34.695
DID YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE MONEY?

09:34.695 --> 09:37.537
DID YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE $10 MILLION
WHEN YOU USED ME

09:37.537 --> 09:38.999
- TO GET TO YOUR DAD?
- NO.

09:38.999 --> 09:41.962
CHARLIE IS MANIPULATING YOU
TO GET BETWEEN US.

09:41.962 --> 09:44.584
THERE IS NO "US"!

09:44.584 --> 09:46.006
STAY AWAY FROM CHARLIE,

09:46.006 --> 09:48.799
AND STAY AWAY FROM ME.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.270
( indistinct chatter )

10:00.270 --> 10:01.932
HEY!

10:01.932 --> 10:04.604
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THAT LIT TEACHER,
MR. AVEDON?

10:04.604 --> 10:06.026
I'VE NEVER HAD AVEDON.

10:06.026 --> 10:07.607
OH. SO I GUESS
YOU DON'T KNOW

10:07.607 --> 10:09.109
IF HE ALWAYS WEARS
THOSE TIGHT V-NECK TEES

10:09.109 --> 10:10.691
THAT SHOW OFF
HIS LITTLE MAN BOOBS?

10:10.691 --> 10:13.323
WOW, THANK YOU FOR THAT
MENTAL IMAGE.

10:13.323 --> 10:15.075
JUST PAYING IT FORWARD.

10:15.075 --> 10:16.657
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO
TONIGHT?

10:16.657 --> 10:18.198
UM, I DON'T KNOW.

10:18.198 --> 10:20.240
PROBABLY HOMEWORK
AND WATCH SOME TV.

10:20.240 --> 10:21.742
MY MOM'S ACTUALLY
TAKING MY LITTLE SISTER

10:21.742 --> 10:23.373
TO GO GET HER EARS PIERCED,
SO I THOUGHT

10:23.373 --> 10:24.955
I'D GO AND WATCH.

10:24.955 --> 10:26.797
ARE YOU TRYING
TO DEPRESS ME?

10:26.797 --> 10:30.010
BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING
AN AMAZING JOB.

10:30.010 --> 10:31.802
LET'S GO INTO THE CITY.

10:31.802 --> 10:33.593
THE CITY?

10:33.593 --> 10:34.805
AS IN NEW YORK CITY?

10:34.805 --> 10:37.347
AS IN "THE BIG APPLE,"
YEAH.

10:37.347 --> 10:39.139
THERE'S THIS GREAT CLUB
I LIKE TO GO TO.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.521
- I'M KIND OF A REGULAR.
- CLUB? WAIT.

10:41.521 --> 10:43.313
THEY DON'T CARE THAT
YOU'RE UNDERAGE?

10:43.313 --> 10:45.936
NOBODY CARES ABOUT THAT
STUFF WHEN YOU'RE BESTIES
WITH THE BOUNCER.

10:45.936 --> 10:48.108
- OKAY.
- TRUST ME.

10:48.108 --> 10:49.900
THE BEST WAY
TO GET OVER A BREAKUP--

10:49.900 --> 10:51.321
GET THE HELL OUT OF DODGE
FOR A NIGHT.

10:51.321 --> 10:52.733
( sighs )

10:52.733 --> 10:54.985
MY MOM WOULD NEVER
LET ME GO.

10:54.985 --> 10:56.486
THEN DON'T TELL HER.
MAKE SOMETHING UP.

10:56.486 --> 10:59.870
LIVE A LITTLE DANGEROUSLY,
MY GOD.

10:59.870 --> 11:02.542
( sighs )

11:02.542 --> 11:04.124
Whitney: AND THEN
AFTER DINNER,

11:04.124 --> 11:06.086
SHE'S TAKING ME ON A NIGHT
TOUR OF GREEN GROVE.

11:06.086 --> 11:08.498
I THINK IT'LL
REALLY HELP ME BEGIN
TO APPRECIATE THE TOWN.

11:08.498 --> 11:09.790
YOU KNOW?

11:09.790 --> 11:12.002
YEAH, IT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

11:12.002 --> 11:14.004
IT WILL BE.
LACEY'S A SWEETHEART.

11:16.136 --> 11:17.557
BE CAREFUL, HON.

11:17.557 --> 11:19.639
YOU KNOW YOU TEND
TO MAKE CLOSE FRIENDS

11:19.639 --> 11:20.801
A LITTLE TOO QUICKLY.

11:20.801 --> 11:23.643
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, DADDY.
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

11:23.643 --> 11:25.685
Kyle: HELLO.

11:27.477 --> 11:28.979
CHIEF.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.400
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

11:30.400 --> 11:31.902
PLEASE, JACK.
CALL ME KYLE.

11:31.902 --> 11:33.864
I JUST HEARD
ABOUT YOUR SHOP.

11:33.864 --> 11:36.486
I THOUGHT I'D COME BY
AND CHECK IT OUT.

11:36.486 --> 11:37.818
YOU IN THE MARKET
FOR A BOAT?

11:37.818 --> 11:39.449
I AM.

11:39.449 --> 11:40.951
MY WIFE SAYS
IT'S AN INDULGENCE,

11:40.951 --> 11:42.993
BUT I FIGURE A GUY'S GOTTA
GO WITH HIS GUT, YOU KNOW?

11:42.993 --> 11:45.035
YEAH, THOSE WIVES.
THEY BE NAGGING.

11:45.035 --> 11:46.827
( chuckles )

11:46.827 --> 11:47.788
CHIEF, THIS IS
MY DAUGHTER, WHITNEY.

11:47.788 --> 11:50.921
WHITNEY, THIS IS THE CHIEF--
KYLE MASTERSON.

11:50.921 --> 11:53.503
OH, AS IN JO MASTERSON'S
FATHER.

11:53.503 --> 11:54.925
I LOVE HER.
SHE ROCKS.

11:54.925 --> 11:57.177
( chuckles )
I FEEL THE SAME WAY.

11:57.177 --> 11:59.679
ALL RIGHT. I GOTTA GO
TRY ON SOME OUTFITS.

11:59.679 --> 12:00.801
OKAY.

12:00.801 --> 12:02.973
NICE TO MEET YOU,
CHIEF.

12:05.105 --> 12:06.977
WELL, SHE SEEMS
LIKE A HANDFUL.

12:06.977 --> 12:08.849
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

12:09.810 --> 12:12.692
SO WHAT KIND OF BOAT
ARE YOU INTERESTED IN?

12:12.692 --> 12:14.985
HONESTLY...
THE AFFORDABLE KIND.

12:14.985 --> 12:18.158
ALL RIGHT. WELL, LET ME
GET MY PRICE BOOK

12:18.158 --> 12:21.741
AND, UM... WE'LL SEE
WHAT WE CAN FIND.

12:21.741 --> 12:22.993
BE RIGHT BACK.

12:28.959 --> 12:31.581
SO YOU TOOK THIS
FROM HIS TRASH?

12:31.581 --> 12:32.963
I HAD TO WAIT
TILL HE PUT IT OUT.

12:32.963 --> 12:35.215
- ISN'T IT STILL--
- ON THE CURB, IT'S PUBLIC.

12:35.215 --> 12:36.837
LEGIT.
GET IT TO THE LAB.

12:36.837 --> 12:37.968
I WANT THE DNA RESULTS
ASAP.

12:37.968 --> 12:39.259
MIGHT TAKE
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.590
PUT A RUSH ON IT.
CALL IN A FAVOR.

12:40.590 --> 12:42.472
IF WE CAN MATCH
THE DNA ON THIS

12:42.472 --> 12:43.804
TO ONE OF THE HAIRS
WE PULLED FROM THE CAR,

12:43.804 --> 12:45.685
IT'LL AT LEAST BE ENOUGH
FOR US TO BRING HIM IN.

12:45.685 --> 12:46.937
OKAY, OKAY.
I'M ON IT.

12:46.937 --> 12:48.058
OKAY.

12:55.445 --> 12:57.948
KAREN. KAREN--

12:57.948 --> 12:59.820
- WAIT.
- WHAT?

12:59.820 --> 13:02.362
( sighs )
I JUST, UH--

13:02.362 --> 13:04.454
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

13:04.454 --> 13:06.907
( scoffs )
LET'S NOT DO THIS, OKAY?

13:06.907 --> 13:09.459
JUST GIVE ME A SECOND,
PLEASE?

13:09.459 --> 13:11.791
I KNOW YOU'RE STILL HURT.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.874
AND ANGRY.
BUT I NEED YOU TO KNOW,

13:13.874 --> 13:15.675
VIKRAM AND I-- WE NEVER
HAD AN AFFAIR.

13:15.675 --> 13:17.507
- RIGHT.
- WE DIDN'T.

13:17.507 --> 13:19.379
I SWEAR.

13:19.379 --> 13:20.971
THERE WAS ANOTHER REASON.

13:20.971 --> 13:23.013
WHAT WAS IT?

13:23.013 --> 13:26.056
( sighs )
IT'S, UM...

13:26.056 --> 13:27.387
I...

13:27.387 --> 13:29.019
- ( sighs )
- GOODBYE, TESS.

13:29.019 --> 13:30.430
I HAD ANOTHER BABY.

13:31.892 --> 13:33.984
I HAD NOWHERE ELSE
TO TURN,

13:33.984 --> 13:35.235
AND VIKRAM HELPED ME
GIVE HER UP.

13:35.235 --> 13:37.988
I JUST TOLD KYLE
ABOUT IT,

13:37.988 --> 13:39.199
AND I STILL HAVEN'T
TOLD JO.

13:39.199 --> 13:40.861
I THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

13:42.032 --> 13:43.994
I DID KNOW.

13:43.994 --> 13:45.495
VIKRAM TOLD ME.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.255
DANNY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

13:55.255 --> 13:57.007
YOU DON'T REALLY THINK
THAT IT WAS PREMEDITATED.

13:57.007 --> 13:58.548
YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY
BELIEVE THAT.

13:58.548 --> 14:00.130
YOU NEED TO LEAVE.
NOW.

14:00.130 --> 14:01.461
YOU WERE THERE.

14:01.461 --> 14:03.463
YOU SAW WHAT HE WAS LIKE.
WHY I HIT HIM.

14:03.463 --> 14:04.764
HE WAS TRYING
TO HURT US.

14:04.764 --> 14:06.636
WHAT ABOUT THE CHURCH?

14:06.636 --> 14:08.058
YOU DIDN'T EXPECT ME
TO BE THERE.

14:08.058 --> 14:09.679
YOU PLANNED TO MEET HIM
ALONE.

14:09.679 --> 14:11.021
I JUST WANTED YOU
TO BE SAFE.

14:11.021 --> 14:13.233
OR YOU DIDN'T WANT
ANY WITNESSES.

14:13.233 --> 14:14.975
PLEASE JUST GO.
LEAVE.

14:14.975 --> 14:17.777
I'LL GO... AND I'M NOT
GOING TO BOTHER YOU ANYMORE.

14:17.777 --> 14:20.610
BUT I DID NOT PLAN
TO KILL MY FATHER.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.192
IT JUST HAPPENED.

14:22.192 --> 14:24.484
AND DEEP DOWN,
I THINK YOU KNOW THAT.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.619
YOU KILLED YOUR DAD?

14:34.834 --> 14:36.256
AND THEN HE WENT
AFTER DANNY,

14:36.256 --> 14:38.668
SO DANNY GRABBED
A PIECE OF WOOD

14:38.668 --> 14:39.669
AND HIT HIM WITH IT.

14:39.669 --> 14:42.762
AND... WELL,
VIKRAM, HE, UM...

14:42.762 --> 14:44.264
I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

14:44.264 --> 14:46.846
- THIS IS--
- IT'S INSANE. I KNOW.

14:46.846 --> 14:48.678
DANNY, WHAT ABOUT THE CAR?

14:48.678 --> 14:49.849
I MEAN, THEY FOUND
YOUR DAD'S BODY

14:49.849 --> 14:52.012
IN THAT-- IN THAT WRECK,
THE CAR ACCIDENT.

14:54.894 --> 14:55.895
SOMEONE MOVED THE BODY
AND MADE IT LOOK LIKE
AN ACCIDENT.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.517
JO. STOP.

14:57.517 --> 14:59.149
WOW.

14:59.149 --> 15:00.820
OKAY, THEN, UM,

15:00.820 --> 15:01.821
WHY DIDN'T YOU GO
TO THE POLICE?

15:01.821 --> 15:03.403
SAY THAT IT WAS
SELF-DEFENSE.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.784
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T, AND YOU
NEED TO FORGET ALL THIS, OKAY?

15:04.784 --> 15:06.156
OKAY, YOU'RE NOT
HELPING, DANNY.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.907
LOOK, I GET IT.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.370
YOU CAN TRUST ME.
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL ANYONE.

15:10.370 --> 15:11.992
THEN WHY
AM I SO WORRIED?

15:11.992 --> 15:13.083
OKAY, JUST GO.

15:13.083 --> 15:15.085
I'M SORRY.
WE CAN LEAVE WHEN HE'S GONE.

15:16.496 --> 15:17.707
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS GOING?

15:17.707 --> 15:19.749
OUT. ON A DATE.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.753
( scoffs )

15:32.932 --> 15:36.396
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU KNEW
ALL THIS TIME.

15:36.396 --> 15:38.188
VIKRAM SWORE ME
TO SECRECY.

15:38.188 --> 15:40.190
HE SAID YOU NEVER
WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT.

15:42.562 --> 15:44.324
DID HE THREATEN
TO TELL KYLE?

15:44.324 --> 15:46.526
I MEAN, IS THAT WHY
YOU KEPT IT A SECRET?

15:46.526 --> 15:48.828
NO.

15:48.828 --> 15:51.371
VIKRAM WASN'T
ALWAYS BAD, KAREN.

15:51.371 --> 15:53.623
AT LEAST BACK THEN.

15:53.623 --> 15:54.784
BUT YOU REGRET IT NOW.

15:54.784 --> 15:55.955
I REGRET A LOT OF THINGS.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.917
I MEAN, TRUSTING HIM.
VIKRAM.

15:57.917 --> 15:59.709
I DON'T KNOW.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.961
I-- I JUST WISH
I KNEW MORE.

16:04.674 --> 16:07.587
I KNOW WHERE HE KEPT
THE ADOPTION PAPERS.

16:07.587 --> 16:10.890
HE TOLD ME HE WAS HANGING ON
TO THEM IN CASE YOU EVER...

16:12.682 --> 16:14.684
DO YOU WANT TO FIND
YOUR CHILD?

16:16.556 --> 16:18.018
OF COURSE I DO.

16:20.270 --> 16:23.233
Jo: YOU'RE STILL REALLY
FREAKED OUT, AREN'T YOU?

16:23.233 --> 16:25.485
A LITTLE.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.906
A LITTLE?

16:26.906 --> 16:29.739
I'D BE RUNNING AWAY
SCREAMING BY NOW.

16:29.739 --> 16:33.493
NO, I-- I WANT TO BE HERE.
I'M JUST... PROCESSING.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.996
BUT, LOOK, I MEAN,
IT SOUNDS LIKE SELF-DEFENSE.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.078
I DON'T THINK DANNY WOULD--

16:38.078 --> 16:40.210
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT DANNY.

16:41.421 --> 16:43.173
OKAY. WELL, I MEAN,
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

16:43.173 --> 16:45.965
HOW ARE YOU HANDLING
ALL OF THIS?

16:45.965 --> 16:48.338
I DON'T KNOW.

16:48.338 --> 16:50.800
I WANT TO SAY THAT
I'M OKAY, BUT I...

16:50.800 --> 16:53.803
I JUST DON'T WANT IT TO
AFFECT THE REST OF MY LIFE.

16:53.803 --> 16:54.974
YOU KNOW?

16:54.974 --> 16:57.347
IT WON'T.
IF YOU DON'T LET IT.

16:57.347 --> 17:00.060
WE ALL HAVE MESSED-UP
STUFF FROM OUR PAST.

17:00.060 --> 17:04.984
YOU JUST FIND A WAY
TO SURVIVE IT.

17:04.984 --> 17:07.817
WOW, THAT WAS REALLY CHEESY.

17:07.817 --> 17:10.029
IT'S REALLY SWEET.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.992
JO? JO, HEY!

17:12.992 --> 17:14.784
HEY, LOOK AT THAT.

17:14.784 --> 17:15.865
GREAT MINDS THINK ALIKE.

17:15.865 --> 17:17.117
DID YOU GUYS
JUST GET HERE?

17:17.117 --> 17:19.579
YEP, JUST TAKING MY LADY
OUT ON THE TOWN.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.000
MY LADY?

17:21.000 --> 17:23.543
ARE YOU A 15TH-CENTURY
KNIGHT ALL OF A SUDDEN?

17:23.543 --> 17:26.926
NO, BUT I AM THE FIRST MAN
OF GREEN GROVE HIGH.

17:26.926 --> 17:28.838
CONGRATS AGAIN
ON THE WIN, ANDIE.

17:28.838 --> 17:30.970
THANKS.
I OWE IT ALL TO YOU.

17:30.970 --> 17:32.262
YOU EARNED IT.

17:32.262 --> 17:33.673
ALL RIGHT--

17:33.673 --> 17:36.676
SHOULD WE CONTINUE
THE FOOD TOUR, MY LADY?

17:36.676 --> 17:39.179
DEFINITELY.
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

17:39.179 --> 17:41.351
HAVE FUN,
YOU CRAZY KIDS.

17:41.351 --> 17:43.062
WHO KNEW, HUH?

17:43.062 --> 17:45.485
FOOD TRUCKS, THE MOST ROMANTIC
SPOT IN GREEN GROVE TONIGHT.

17:46.946 --> 17:49.399
OH, DARN,
I HAVE LIKE SEVEN TEXTS

17:49.399 --> 17:50.690
FROM STUDENT COUNCIL
PEOPLE.

17:50.690 --> 17:53.693
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK,
OKAY?

17:58.037 --> 17:59.869
Lacey: OKAY, SO...

17:59.869 --> 18:01.961
HE WAS IN JUVIE WITH YOU.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
BEFORE?

18:01.961 --> 18:04.794
BECAUSE-- BECAUSE HE
ASKED ME NOT TO.

18:04.794 --> 18:06.416
LOOK, I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS THAT BIG A DEAL,

18:06.416 --> 18:09.669
BUT NOW, I DON'T KNOW--
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS GUY
IS WEIRD.

18:09.669 --> 18:11.511
HE SHOWS UP
WHEN I'M ON THE RUN.

18:11.511 --> 18:14.013
HE ENROLLS IN MY SCHOOL,
STARTS HANGING OUT
WITH MY FRIENDS,

18:14.013 --> 18:17.717
AND HE GETS A JOB
AT THE HORSE STABLES
WHERE YOU HAVE A HORSE?

18:17.717 --> 18:18.928
AND NOW HE'S OFF
WITH JO--

18:18.928 --> 18:21.771
JO? ( sighs )
I GET IT.

18:21.771 --> 18:22.982
YOU'RE JEALOUS.

18:22.982 --> 18:23.853
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT.

18:23.853 --> 18:24.934
OF COURSE IT IS.

18:28.608 --> 18:29.819
HEY.

18:29.819 --> 18:32.822
LOOK, UM...

18:32.822 --> 18:34.113
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE HURT.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.535
AND THAT YOU'RE MAD,
AND I'M SORRY.

18:35.535 --> 18:36.696
FINE, WHATEVER.
I HAVE TO GO.

18:36.696 --> 18:37.907
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

18:37.907 --> 18:39.949
THERE'S SOMETHING OFF
ABOUT THIS CHARLIE GUY.

18:39.949 --> 18:41.831
AND NOW THAT HE KNOWS

18:41.831 --> 18:42.872
WHAT HAPPENED
WITH MY FATHER,

18:42.872 --> 18:45.084
I'M WORRIED.

18:45.084 --> 18:47.046
I JUST-- I THINK HE
MIGHT BE DANGEROUS.

18:47.046 --> 18:48.418
- YOU SOUND PARANOID.
- NO.

18:48.418 --> 18:49.839
I'M NOT.
I'M TELLING YOU.

18:49.839 --> 18:51.421
THIS IS REAL,
AND I'M GOING TO PROVE IT.

19:00.390 --> 19:02.021
( softly snorting )

19:03.142 --> 19:05.815
SO HE, UH,
HE JUST SHOWED UP

19:05.815 --> 19:06.936
ASKING FOR A JOB?

19:06.936 --> 19:09.479
YEP, A FEW WEEKS BACK.

19:09.479 --> 19:11.731
KID'S A GOOD WORKER.

19:11.731 --> 19:13.152
SO YOU SAID YOU'RE
A FRIEND OF HIS?

19:13.152 --> 19:15.325
YEAH, YEAH.
WE GO WAY BACK.

19:15.325 --> 19:16.736
DID HE SAY ANYTHING ELSE?

19:16.736 --> 19:18.948
GIVE YOU A SENSE
OF WHY HE CAME HERE?

19:18.948 --> 19:20.990
NO, CHARLIE
DOESN'T SAY MUCH.

19:20.990 --> 19:22.912
POOR KID WAS DESPERATE,
THOUGH.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.624
HE ASKED ME FOR A JOB--

19:24.624 --> 19:26.456
- A PLACE TO LIVE.
OH, SORRY.
- ( phone vibrates )

19:26.456 --> 19:28.998
THAT WAS VERY NICE OF YOU
TO TAKE HIM IN LIKE THAT.

19:28.998 --> 19:31.881
NO SWEAT OFF MY BACK.

19:31.881 --> 19:33.883
YEAH, HE NEEDED A--
A LOCAL RESIDENCE

19:33.883 --> 19:37.056
TO ENROLL
AT GREEN GROVE HIGH.

19:37.056 --> 19:40.300
KID WAS 18, SO I DIDN'T
ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.802
YOU KNOW, HE'S USUALLY
HOME BY NOW.

19:42.802 --> 19:45.475
IF YOU WANT TO HEAD ON UP
TO HIS ROOM, SAY HELLO?

19:56.115 --> 19:57.367
( squeaking )

20:43.913 --> 20:45.825
YO, MAN,
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU.

20:45.825 --> 20:48.458
I'M GOING
TO MISS YOU, TOO, MAN.

20:48.458 --> 20:51.000
UH, WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR?

20:52.332 --> 20:54.794
UH... MY PHOTO.

20:54.794 --> 20:57.256
YOU KNOW THE ONE WITH
ME AND LACEY AND JO?

20:57.256 --> 20:59.138
CAN'T FIND IT.
IT'S VANISHED.

20:59.138 --> 21:01.761
( sighs )

21:01.761 --> 21:03.933
WELL, MAYBE-- I MEAN,
MAYBE ONE OF THE, UH,

21:03.933 --> 21:05.845
YOU KNOW,
THE GUARDS TOOK IT.

21:05.845 --> 21:08.227
MY PHOTO?
WHY WOULD THEY TAKE MY PHOTO?

21:08.227 --> 21:10.940
DUDE, I MEAN, YOU KNOW
HOW THEY CAN BE.

21:10.940 --> 21:13.062
LOOK, I'M-- THEY'RE GOING
TO COME FOR ME ANY MINUTE

21:13.062 --> 21:14.984
AND I REALLY DON'T
WANT TO LEAVE WITHOUT IT.

21:14.984 --> 21:17.987
UH... OKAY, WELL--
WELL, IF I FIND IT,

21:17.987 --> 21:19.949
THEN MAYBE
I CAN SEND IT TO YOU.

21:21.531 --> 21:22.902
THANKS, MAN.

21:37.967 --> 21:41.511
( door opens )

21:41.511 --> 21:43.593
IT'S LIKE HE NEVER
LEFT, HUH?

21:43.593 --> 21:46.015
I DON'T LIKE
COMING IN HERE

21:46.015 --> 21:47.306
EVER SINCE...

21:47.306 --> 21:50.930
WELL, SINCE THE FIRST TIME
VIK DIED.

21:50.930 --> 21:52.692
I'M ACTUALLY THINKING
OF TURNING THIS

21:52.692 --> 21:54.984
INTO A PILATES STUDIO.

21:54.984 --> 21:56.936
KAREN, THANK YOU FOR
DOING THIS, EVEN THOUGH--

21:56.936 --> 21:58.438
IT'S FINE.

21:58.438 --> 22:00.610
I GUESS WE ALL
HAVE SECRETS, HUH?

22:00.610 --> 22:02.071
YEAH.

22:02.071 --> 22:04.153
ESPECIALLY VIKRAM.

22:04.153 --> 22:06.996
WHO KNOWS WHAT SECRETS
ARE HIDING IN THIS THING.

22:06.996 --> 22:08.998
( chuckles )
YEAH.

22:08.998 --> 22:11.951
I JUST CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHY HE WOULD

22:11.951 --> 22:13.413
FAKE HIS OWN DEATH.

22:13.413 --> 22:15.004
I MEAN, DID HE
EVER EXPLAIN IT TO YOU?

22:15.004 --> 22:18.257
NO. ALL HE TOLD ME

22:18.257 --> 22:19.509
WAS THAT HIS LIFE
WAS IN DANGER.

22:19.509 --> 22:22.011
IN DANGER?
FROM WHO?

22:22.011 --> 22:23.923
HE WOULDN'T SAY.

22:23.923 --> 22:25.094
( opens drawer )

22:25.094 --> 22:27.427
I SORT OF GOT A SENSE
IT WAS SOMEONE HE WORKED WITH.

22:27.427 --> 22:31.521
I MEAN... MAYBE A BUSINESS
DEAL GONE WRONG OR SOMETHING.

22:31.521 --> 22:32.852
I DON'T KNOW.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.474
YEAH.

22:34.474 --> 22:36.566
OR SOMETHING.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.861

STUDENT COUNCIL?

24:14.954 --> 24:16.786
MM-HMM.
DON'T YOU HATE IT

24:16.786 --> 24:18.878
WHEN PEOPLE RETURN CALLS
AT THE DINNER TABLE?

24:18.878 --> 24:20.880
( chuckles )
YEAH.

24:20.880 --> 24:23.633
OKAY, WELL,
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

24:28.427 --> 24:30.800
HOW IS IT?

24:30.800 --> 24:33.763
IT'S MESSY.

24:37.186 --> 24:38.437
SO...

24:38.437 --> 24:40.019
EARLIER YOU SAID SOMETHING

24:40.019 --> 24:41.901
ABOUT MESSED-UP STUFF
FROM YOUR PAST.

24:41.901 --> 24:44.734
YEAH.

24:44.734 --> 24:46.105
I GUESS I SORT OF
OPENED MYSELF UP

24:46.105 --> 24:47.106
WITH THAT ONE, HUH?

24:47.106 --> 24:48.317
YEAH.

24:48.317 --> 24:50.449
ALL RIGHT.

24:50.449 --> 24:52.241
LET'S HEAR THE QUESTIONS.
FIRE AWAY.

24:52.241 --> 24:53.533
OKAY.

24:53.533 --> 24:55.665
LAST NIGHT YOU SAID
YOU WENT TO JUVIE

24:55.665 --> 24:57.416
BECAUSE YOU STOLE A CAR,
RIGHT?

24:57.416 --> 25:00.620
SO... WHY DID YOU?

25:04.674 --> 25:07.216
UM... I WAS YOUNG.

25:07.216 --> 25:09.178
I WAS ANGRY.

25:09.178 --> 25:10.970
STUPID.

25:12.932 --> 25:15.434
MY MOM HAD RECENTLY DIED.

25:15.434 --> 25:20.309
AND, UM, MY DAD LEFT
WHEN I WAS REALLY LITTLE.

25:20.309 --> 25:22.481
SO I WAS ALONE.

25:22.481 --> 25:23.643
UM...

25:23.643 --> 25:26.696
SO THEY PUT ME IN THIS--
IN THIS FOSTER HOME.

25:26.696 --> 25:28.908
BUT THE PEOPLE THERE,
THEY BASICALLY IGNORED ME.

25:28.908 --> 25:32.952
SO I, I DON'T KNOW,
I FELL IN WITH THIS
GROUP OF OLDER GUYS.

25:32.952 --> 25:37.156
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
THEY WEREN'T REALLY
THE BEST ROLE MODELS.

25:37.156 --> 25:38.417
( chuckles )

25:38.417 --> 25:41.080
CHARLIE, I'M...

25:41.080 --> 25:42.582
I'M REALLY SORRY.

25:42.582 --> 25:43.963
AH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO--
DON'T BE.

25:43.963 --> 25:45.925
I MEAN...

25:45.925 --> 25:49.218
LIFE'S ALL ABOUT
SECOND CHANCES, RIGHT?

25:50.880 --> 25:53.012
UM, DO YOU...

25:53.012 --> 25:54.343
DO YOU WANT A SODA?

25:54.343 --> 25:55.885
SURE.

25:55.885 --> 25:57.887
DON'T MOVE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

26:12.822 --> 26:13.903
HEY.

26:13.903 --> 26:15.785
HEY.

26:15.785 --> 26:17.116
WHERE'S ANDIE?

26:17.116 --> 26:19.248
OH, SHE'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
OFF ON THE PHONE

26:19.248 --> 26:20.579
WITH THE STUDENT
COUNCIL GANG.

26:20.579 --> 26:21.701
YOU KNOW,
PRESIDENTIAL STUFF.

26:21.701 --> 26:22.702
MM-HMM.

26:22.702 --> 26:24.163
THIS MUST BE HOW
MICHELLE OBAMA FEELS.

26:24.163 --> 26:25.755
HUH?
( chuckles )

26:25.755 --> 26:28.297
OH, YOU WANT
A SALMON SKIN ROLL?

26:28.297 --> 26:29.508
ARE THEY GOOD?

26:29.508 --> 26:31.340
NO. NOT REALLY.

26:31.340 --> 26:33.883
YEAH, RAW FISH OFF
A TRUCK WASN'T REALLY...

26:33.883 --> 26:35.174
MY BEST DECISION.

26:35.174 --> 26:37.016
WHERE'S, UH--
WHERE'S CHARLIE?

26:37.016 --> 26:40.429
OH, HE'S GETTING US DRINKS.

26:40.429 --> 26:43.062
DO YOU WANT ME TO STICK
AROUND TILL ANDIE GETS BACK?

26:43.062 --> 26:45.274
OH, NO. NO. IT'S NOT
REALLY LIKE A BIG DEAL.

26:45.274 --> 26:47.356
YOU KNOW,
SHE'S JUST SUPER BUSY.

26:47.356 --> 26:49.779
SO IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M WORRIED, YOU KNOW,

26:49.779 --> 26:52.151
THAT IT'S SOMETHING ELSE
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

26:52.151 --> 26:55.074
YOU'RE WORRIED THAT IT'S
SOMETHING ELSE, AREN'T YOU?

26:55.074 --> 26:56.495
YEAH.
YEAH, KIND OF.

26:56.495 --> 26:58.998
YOU KNOW, I--

26:58.998 --> 27:00.830
I JUST REALLY LIKE HER,
YOU KNOW?

27:03.042 --> 27:05.414
WELL, FROM WHERE I'M SITTING,
SHE'S CRAZY ABOUT YOU.

27:06.956 --> 27:08.958
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

27:10.459 --> 27:13.012
CHARLIE SEEMS PRETTY NICE.

27:13.012 --> 27:16.215
YEAH. I LIKE HIM.

27:16.215 --> 27:18.217
WELL, I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

27:23.472 --> 27:24.854
( phone vibrates )

27:44.413 --> 27:46.956
YOU KNOW, LACEY,
YOU REMIND ME

27:46.956 --> 27:50.549
OF THIS GIRL THAT I
DATED BACK AT DARTMOUTH.

27:50.549 --> 27:51.881
IS THAT SO?

27:51.881 --> 27:53.592
IT IS.

27:53.592 --> 27:57.256
BUT YOU ARE WAY SEXIER
THAN HER.

27:57.256 --> 27:59.388
OH, WELL,
THANK YOU, KEVIN.

27:59.388 --> 28:01.560
SO, UH,
WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

28:01.560 --> 28:03.512
EAST OR WEST SIDE?

28:03.512 --> 28:05.855
OH, NEITHER.
I LIVE IN GREEN GROVE.

28:05.855 --> 28:08.437
- UPSTATE, NICE.
- YEAH.

28:08.437 --> 28:09.648
WHAT DO YOU DO THERE?

28:09.648 --> 28:12.111
I GO TO HIGH SCHOOL.

28:14.774 --> 28:19.238
YOU KNOW, I WAS CAPTAIN
OF THE LACROSSE TEAM

28:19.238 --> 28:21.580
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

28:21.580 --> 28:23.242
STAYING IN THE CITY
TONIGHT?

28:23.242 --> 28:26.455
BECAUSE I AM
PRETTY GOOD FRIENDS

28:26.455 --> 28:28.788
WITH THE CONCIERGE
AT THE ST. REGIS,

28:28.788 --> 28:31.831

GET US A SICK ROOM WITH A--

28:31.831 --> 28:34.253
OKAY, KEVIN,
THANK YOU SO MUCH

28:34.253 --> 28:37.636

THE STIMULATING CONVERSATION.

28:37.636 --> 28:39.428
THIS HAS BEEN DELIGHTFUL.

28:39.428 --> 28:41.140
AH, TA-TA.

28:43.973 --> 28:46.605
( laughing )

28:46.605 --> 28:48.938
I CAN'T BELIEVE

28:48.938 --> 28:50.649
I KNOW.
DID YOU NOTICE THE TAN LINE

28:50.649 --> 28:51.941
AROUND HIS
LEFT RING FINGER?

28:51.941 --> 28:52.902
WAIT, THAT CREEP'S
MARRIED?

28:52.902 --> 28:54.944
MARRIED GUYS TAKE THEIR
RINGS OFF ALL THE TIME

28:54.944 --> 28:56.946
TO GO PICK UP WOMEN--
ESPECIALLY IN THE CITY.

28:56.946 --> 28:58.027
IT'S, LIKE, CULTURAL.

28:58.027 --> 29:00.119
- OH.

29:00.119 --> 29:02.321

29:04.453 --> 29:06.245
CALL HOME.

29:06.245 --> 29:07.917
OH, NO NO NO.
NO NO. WHITNEY--

29:07.917 --> 29:09.498
- I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD--
- SHH. HELLO?

29:09.498 --> 29:11.580
HI, IS THIS KEVIN'S WIFE?

29:11.580 --> 29:12.962
OH, MY...

29:12.962 --> 29:15.754
YES, IT'S HIS PHONE.
CHILL. I'M ONLY BORROWING IT.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.756
I JUST MET YOUR HUBBY
OUT AT A CLUB

29:17.756 --> 29:19.758
AND HE IS A CHARMER.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.431
HE INVITED MY FRIEND TO SPEND
THE NIGHT AT A HOTEL.

29:22.431 --> 29:24.053
WAIT, SO WHAT WAS THE NAME
OF THE HOTEL?

29:24.053 --> 29:25.764
WHITNEY, DON'T.
COME ON.

29:25.764 --> 29:26.806
THE ST. REGIS.

29:26.806 --> 29:29.058
ANYWAY, WE JUST WANTED
TO CHECK WITH YOU

29:29.058 --> 29:31.851
SINCE WE ASSUMED YOU
MIGHT NOT BE COOL WITH THAT.

29:33.813 --> 29:36.025
YEAH. THAT'S WHAT
WE THOUGHT YOU'D SAY.

29:44.663 --> 29:46.365
SO WHAT'S NEXT?

29:46.365 --> 29:48.367
NEXT? WOW.

29:48.367 --> 29:50.119
YOU ARE INSATIABLE,
MASTERSON.

29:50.119 --> 29:52.581
COME ON.
LET'S GO SKIP STONES AGAIN.

29:52.581 --> 29:54.173
DON'T YOU WANT A REMATCH?

29:54.173 --> 29:57.416
OBVIOUSLY, BUT I ALSO
HAVE TO BE A GENTLEMAN.

29:57.416 --> 29:58.968
CAN'T KEEP YOU OUT
TOO LATE.

29:58.968 --> 30:00.970
I AM DATING THE CHIEF
OF POLICE'S DAUGHTER.

30:00.970 --> 30:02.681
GOTTA WATCH MY STEP.

30:02.681 --> 30:04.633
SO WE'RE DATING NOW?

30:04.633 --> 30:08.477
I MEAN... IF ONE DATE
COUNTS AS DATING.

30:08.477 --> 30:11.140
I THINK IT'S
TWO DATES MINIMUM.

30:11.140 --> 30:12.932
OKAY.

30:12.932 --> 30:15.144
FRIDAY NIGHT.
YOU'RE ON.

30:15.144 --> 30:17.106
COME ON.

30:17.106 --> 30:18.737
LET'S GET YOU HOME.

30:27.116 --> 30:29.748
SO HE DID IT OUT-OF-STATE.

30:29.748 --> 30:31.330
FRANKLIN LAKES,
NEW JERSEY....

30:31.330 --> 30:33.873
TO SUSAN AND CLYDE BAXTER.
IT'S ONLY AN HOUR DRIVE.

30:33.873 --> 30:34.833
WE CAN'T JUST SHOW UP THERE.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.215
I KNOW IT'S CRAZY.

30:36.215 --> 30:37.877
I JUST-- I REALLY
NEED TO SEE THEM.

30:37.877 --> 30:38.878
TALK TO THEM IN PERSON.

30:38.878 --> 30:41.840
I WON'T BE PUSHY
ABOUT MEETING HER.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.802
I JUST NEED TO KNOW
SHE'S OKAY.

30:43.802 --> 30:44.924
JUST WAIT TILL
TOMORROW MORNING,

30:44.924 --> 30:46.465
AND CALL THEM THEN.

30:46.465 --> 30:48.888
NO. I CAN'T SLEEP
ON THIS.

30:48.888 --> 30:50.139
TESS, COME ON.

30:50.139 --> 30:51.640
IF YOU WAIT, I PROMISE

30:51.640 --> 30:52.932
I'LL GO WITH YOU,
HELP YOU.

30:52.932 --> 30:54.563
I'VE HELD ALL THIS
IN FOR YEARS.

30:54.563 --> 30:57.236
I'M NOT WAITING
ANOTHER MINUTE.

30:57.236 --> 30:58.857
( door closes )

30:58.857 --> 31:01.280
( cellphone ringing )

31:05.444 --> 31:06.745
HELLO.

31:06.745 --> 31:08.537
EDDIE, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
FOR ME?

31:15.334 --> 31:16.875
( door opens )

31:16.875 --> 31:19.708
HEY.

31:19.708 --> 31:22.091
I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO CALL YOU.

31:24.263 --> 31:25.925
HOW ARE YOU?

31:27.846 --> 31:29.348
WHEN YOU QUIT WORKING
FOR VIKRAM,

31:29.348 --> 31:30.849
YOU NEVER SAW HIM
AGAIN, RIGHT?

31:30.849 --> 31:32.851
KAREN, WHAT'S WRONG?
WHY ARE YOU TALKING
TO ME LIKE THIS?

31:32.851 --> 31:34.813
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT YOU
TOLD ME, SO IS THAT RIGHT?

31:34.813 --> 31:36.515
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT'S WRONG?

31:36.515 --> 31:38.777
WHAT'S WRONG IS YOU'RE NOT
ANSWERING MY QUESTION.

31:40.519 --> 31:42.441
OKAY, YES.

31:42.441 --> 31:44.283
I DID, I--

31:44.283 --> 31:45.945
I DID TALK TO HIM.
I WENT TO SEE HIM.

31:45.945 --> 31:48.527
BUT JUST ONCE,
ONLY ONCE.

31:48.527 --> 31:51.080
WHY DOES IT MATTER?
VIKRAM'S DEAD.

31:51.080 --> 31:53.032
HE'S GONE.
WE'RE BETTER OFF FOR IT.

31:53.032 --> 31:54.493
IT'S NOT ABOUT HIM.

31:54.493 --> 31:56.875
HOW COULD YOU KEEP
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
FROM ME?

32:02.541 --> 32:04.463
HE WAS CHEATING ON YOU.

32:04.463 --> 32:05.965
OKAY?
I FOUND OUT.

32:05.965 --> 32:07.636
SO I WENT,
I CONFRONTED HIM.

32:07.636 --> 32:09.138
IT GOT HEATED.

32:09.138 --> 32:10.809
AND-- AND I TOLD HIM--

32:10.809 --> 32:13.312
ABOUT US.

32:14.603 --> 32:16.855
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.
IT JUST HAPPENED.

32:18.317 --> 32:20.980
I WASN'T OVER YOU.

32:20.980 --> 32:24.733
IT WAS YEARS LATER, AND I
WAS STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU.

32:25.985 --> 32:28.947
WE ARGUED AND I LEFT,
OKAY?

32:28.947 --> 32:29.989
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

32:29.989 --> 32:31.700
I DON'T KNOW.

32:31.700 --> 32:32.781
SIX MONTHS AGO, MAYBE.

32:32.781 --> 32:35.034
OH, AROUND THE TIME
THAT HE DISAPPEARED

32:35.034 --> 32:36.375
OFF HIS BOAT?

32:36.375 --> 32:38.037
NO, IT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

32:38.037 --> 32:39.788
- KAREN, I WOULD NEVER--
- YOU TRIED TO KILL HIM.

32:39.788 --> 32:41.080
DIDN'T YOU?

32:41.080 --> 32:42.581
YOU ATTACKED HIM
ON HIS BOAT.

32:42.581 --> 32:43.752
CALM DOWN, OKAY?

32:43.752 --> 32:45.044
DON'T TELL ME
TO CALM DOWN!

32:45.044 --> 32:47.006
WELL, LISTEN TO WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING.

32:47.006 --> 32:49.638
HOW COULD YOU THINK
I'M CAPABLE OF SOMETHING
LIKE THIS, KAREN?

32:49.638 --> 32:52.641
WELL, YOU'RE CAPABLE
OF MOVING HIS BODY.

32:52.641 --> 32:53.892
WHAT?

32:54.973 --> 32:56.475
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

32:56.475 --> 32:58.187
JACK, STOP PLAYING
GAMES WITH ME.

32:58.187 --> 32:59.938
YOU MOVED HIS BODY,

32:59.938 --> 33:01.230
AND YOU MADE IT LOOK
LIKE AN ACCIDENT.

33:01.230 --> 33:04.273
I KNOW YOU DID THIS
TO PROTECT ME AND DANNY.

33:04.273 --> 33:07.566
BUT IF YOU TRIED TO KILL
VIKRAM ON THAT BOAT,

33:07.566 --> 33:08.817
I NEED TO KNOW.

33:08.817 --> 33:11.280
GET OUT, KAREN.

33:12.371 --> 33:13.952
GET OUT, KAREN!

33:17.456 --> 33:20.329
( door opens, closes )

33:22.791 --> 33:23.882
( slamming )

33:27.176 --> 33:29.218
( sighs )
YOU KNOW WHAT?

33:29.218 --> 33:31.390
I'M WIPED.

33:31.390 --> 33:33.222
MAYBE WE SHOULD
SKIP THE MOVIE.

33:33.222 --> 33:35.634
UH...

33:35.634 --> 33:37.186
OH, OKAY.

33:37.186 --> 33:39.268
I'M SORRY.
I HAVE THAT EARLY

33:39.268 --> 33:40.769
STUDENT COUNCIL MEETING
TOMORROW MORNING,

33:40.769 --> 33:42.601
AND...

33:42.601 --> 33:44.193
ARE YOU GONNA
BREAK UP WITH ME?

33:45.774 --> 33:47.606
WHAT? NO.

33:47.606 --> 33:49.488
RICO, WHY WOULD YOU--

33:49.488 --> 33:52.111
I DON'T KNOW,
YOU'VE BEEN ACTING
REALLY WEIRD TONIGHT

33:52.111 --> 33:54.533
AND AT FIRST I THOUGHT
IT WAS PRESIDENTIAL STUFF,

33:54.533 --> 33:56.705
BUT NOW IT SEEMS
LIKE IT'S ABOUT ME.

33:56.705 --> 33:59.788
NO. IT'S NOT
YOU AT ALL.

33:59.788 --> 34:02.081
I REALLY LIKE YOU,
BUT IF YOU'RE LOSING
INTEREST JUST TELL ME.

34:02.081 --> 34:03.582
I'M A VIRGIN.

34:03.582 --> 34:04.833
WAIT, WHAT?

34:04.833 --> 34:06.965
VIRGIN.

34:06.965 --> 34:08.217
V-I-R-G--

34:08.217 --> 34:09.718
YEAH,
I KNOW HOW TO SPELL IT.

34:09.718 --> 34:12.131
UM... OH, GOD!

34:12.131 --> 34:13.972
YOU THINK I WANT...

34:13.972 --> 34:16.675
YEAH, SEX.

34:16.675 --> 34:17.846
THE ROMANTIC
NIGHT OUT,

34:17.846 --> 34:20.389
THE MOVIE,
THE FOOD TRUCKS.

34:20.389 --> 34:21.810
FOOD TRUCKS MEANS SEX?

34:21.810 --> 34:23.812
NO, BUT COMING BACK
TO YOUR PLACE,

34:23.812 --> 34:25.894
IT JUST FEELS SO--

34:27.486 --> 34:29.778
I REALLY LIKE YOU,
RICO,

34:29.778 --> 34:32.531
BUT I'M JUST NOT READY.

34:32.531 --> 34:33.862
YEAH, O-OKAY.

34:33.862 --> 34:36.905
IT'S OKAY. I MEAN,
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
SEX WITH YOU.

34:36.905 --> 34:38.997
YOU DON'T?

34:38.997 --> 34:40.789
( stammers )
WELL, NO, NOT LIKE--

34:40.789 --> 34:42.791
I MEAN, I DO,
UM, A LOT.

34:42.791 --> 34:45.624
BUT NOT YET.
NOT UNTIL WE'RE BOTH READY.

34:45.624 --> 34:47.626
I MEAN,
I'M A VIRGIN TOO.

34:47.626 --> 34:48.707
A BIG ONE.

34:49.798 --> 34:51.170
YOU ARE?

34:51.170 --> 34:52.631
YEAH.

34:52.631 --> 34:55.634
IT'S, UH, SHOCKING, I KNOW.

34:55.634 --> 34:58.096
BUT-- BUT YES.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.309
NOW CAN WE JUST DROP
ALL THE SEX TALK?

35:00.309 --> 35:01.640
YOU WANT TO
WATCH A MOVIE?

35:01.640 --> 35:04.183
YES. YES.

35:04.183 --> 35:05.984
( chuckles )

35:05.984 --> 35:08.687
OH, I'VE SEEN "STAR WARS"
LIKE 100 TIMES,

35:08.687 --> 35:09.858
BUT EVERY TIME
IS LIKE THE FIRST TIME.

35:11.780 --> 35:13.782
( stammers ) I MEAN,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

35:13.782 --> 35:16.195
YEAH.

35:16.195 --> 35:17.196
I DO.

35:18.657 --> 35:20.239
( pounding on door )

35:20.239 --> 35:21.660
COME IN.

35:29.918 --> 35:31.800
CHIEF.

35:31.800 --> 35:32.921
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

35:32.921 --> 35:34.923
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

35:46.225 --> 35:47.976
YOU SHOULD BE
MORE CAREFUL.

35:47.976 --> 35:51.820
STEALING IS WHAT GOT YOU
LOCKED UP IN THE FIRST PLACE.

35:51.820 --> 35:53.232
OR AT LEAST,

35:53.232 --> 35:54.903
THAT'S THE STORY,
RIGHT?

35:57.236 --> 36:00.949
WITH YOU WHO KNOWS
WHAT'S REAL?

36:00.949 --> 36:02.701
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
DANNY?

36:02.701 --> 36:05.914
I WANT TO KNOW WHY
YOU'RE HERE, CHARLIE.

36:05.914 --> 36:06.875
REALLY.

36:06.875 --> 36:08.667
YOU SAID IT WAS
A NICE PLACE.

36:08.667 --> 36:10.088
THAT'S NOT THE REASON.

36:10.088 --> 36:11.590
NOW YOU'VE BEEN
SCREWING WITH ME

36:11.590 --> 36:12.921
EVER SINCE
YOU GOT HERE.

36:12.921 --> 36:14.293
AND I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING WITH JO.

36:14.293 --> 36:15.674
WHAT?

36:15.674 --> 36:17.386
HANGING OUT WITH
A PRETTY GIRL?

36:17.386 --> 36:18.597
( chuckles )

36:18.597 --> 36:19.848
YOU KNOW,

36:19.848 --> 36:22.221
I HATE TO
BREAK IT TO YOU,

36:22.221 --> 36:24.803
BUT I THINK
SHE REALLY LIKES ME.

36:24.803 --> 36:26.975
CHARLIE,
SHE DOESN'T KNOW YOU.

36:26.975 --> 36:29.067
SHE'LL FIGURE YOU OUT.

36:29.067 --> 36:30.439
I'M GONNA
MAKE SURE OF IT.

36:30.439 --> 36:31.570
HOW?

36:31.570 --> 36:33.482
YOU GONNA SHOW HER
A PHOTO?

36:34.813 --> 36:36.775
IT IS CREEPY.

36:36.775 --> 36:38.577
IT'S JUST A PHOTO.

36:38.577 --> 36:39.818
IF IT WAS
JUST A PHOTO,

36:39.818 --> 36:41.410
THEN WHY DID YOU
COME HERE?

36:43.031 --> 36:44.823
AND WHY DO YOU
LOOK SO NERVOUS?

36:44.823 --> 36:47.956
DON'T.
DON'T MESS WITH ME.

36:47.956 --> 36:51.089
AND DON'T MESS
WITH ME AND JO,

36:51.089 --> 36:52.170
OR-- ( laughs )

36:52.170 --> 36:53.792
OR WHAT, CHARLIE?

36:53.792 --> 36:55.254
( sighs )

36:55.254 --> 36:56.835
YOU KNOW WHAT.

36:56.835 --> 36:58.927
I MEAN, MURDER?

36:58.927 --> 37:00.889
AND THIS TIME,

37:00.889 --> 37:04.303
I DON'T THINK THAT
YOU'RE GONNA GET OFF
AS A MINOR, SO...

37:05.644 --> 37:08.647
LEAVE ME AND JO
THE HELL ALONE,

37:08.647 --> 37:10.399
OR I'M GONNA
GO TO THE POLICE

37:10.399 --> 37:12.981
AND I'M GONNA
TELL THEM EVERYTHING

37:12.981 --> 37:14.062
THAT I KNOW.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.569
NOW WHO'S THREATENING?

37:29.788 --> 37:32.371
SO KEVIN'S NOT ABOUT
TO HAVE THE BEST NIGHT, HUH?

37:32.371 --> 37:34.463
I ALMOST FEEL
BAD FOR HIM.

37:34.463 --> 37:36.044
I FEEL BAD
FOR HIS WIFE.

37:36.044 --> 37:37.926
GETTING A CALL
LIKE THAT?

37:37.926 --> 37:38.927
COME ON, WHITNEY,
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT

37:38.927 --> 37:39.928
THAT WAS
KIND OF BRUTAL.

37:39.928 --> 37:42.681
OH, PLEASE. I DID THAT
WOMAN A HUGE FAVOR.

37:42.681 --> 37:45.183
SHE COULD HAVE GONE ON FOR YEARS
WITH THAT CREEP LYING TO HER.

37:45.183 --> 37:47.225
DIVORCE IS ROUGH,

37:47.225 --> 37:50.809
BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS BAD,
YOU KNOW?

37:50.809 --> 37:53.942
WAS IT HARD FOR YOU
WHEN YOUR PARENTS SPLIT UP?

37:53.942 --> 37:56.234
I GUESS.

37:56.234 --> 37:58.817
HONESTLY, I BARELY
REMEMBER THEM MARRIED.

37:58.817 --> 38:01.820
OH, I REMEMBER
MINE MARRIED.

38:01.820 --> 38:02.991
OH.

38:02.991 --> 38:05.904
SORRY, I DIDN'T
EVEN REALIZE.

38:05.904 --> 38:08.246
WHY DID THEY SPLIT?

38:08.246 --> 38:10.669
ONE OF THEM CHEAT?

38:10.669 --> 38:13.832
SORT OF.

38:13.832 --> 38:17.676
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
WHY THEIR MARRIAGE FAILED.

38:17.676 --> 38:18.837
AND NOW EVERY TIME
I BREAK UP WITH SOMEONE,

38:18.837 --> 38:20.419
IT'S LIKE IT--

38:20.419 --> 38:22.721
IT STINGS
A LITTLE EXTRA.

38:23.842 --> 38:24.843
YEAH.

38:28.226 --> 38:29.638
I HAVE NO CLUE

38:29.638 --> 38:31.640
WHY YOU DUMPED DANNY,

38:31.640 --> 38:34.813
BUT I'M SURE YOU HAD
A GOOD REASON.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.815
( sighs ) WHATEVER.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.817
I'M OVER IT,
YOU KNOW?

38:38.817 --> 38:40.649
GUYS, THEY...

38:40.649 --> 38:41.820
( sighs )

38:41.820 --> 38:42.991
SUCK?

38:42.991 --> 38:44.403
AND LIE.

38:44.403 --> 38:46.865
THEY LIE AND KEEP SECRETS,
AND IT'S EXHAUSTING.

38:46.865 --> 38:48.827
YOU ARE PREACHING
TO THE CHOIR.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.248
I'M DONE.

38:50.248 --> 38:51.660
I'M TOTALLY--

38:51.660 --> 38:53.452
I'M TOTALLY
FREAKING DONE.

38:53.452 --> 38:54.793
I'M JUST--

39:02.461 --> 39:04.463
( cellphone rings )

39:09.808 --> 39:11.810
HI, DAD.

39:11.810 --> 39:13.732
YES, I'M WITH LACEY.

39:13.732 --> 39:16.144
WE'RE TOTALLY BONDING.

39:17.816 --> 39:19.398
YOU'RE WHERE?

39:19.398 --> 39:20.609
OH MY GOD.

39:26.905 --> 39:28.747
IS MY DAD OKAY?

39:28.747 --> 39:31.159
HE'S FINE. WE ACTUALLY HAVEN'T
CHARGED HIM WITH ANYTHING YET.

39:31.159 --> 39:32.200
WE'RE JUST
RUNNING SOME TESTS,

39:32.200 --> 39:33.201
AND THEN WE'LL SEE.

39:33.201 --> 39:34.663
WHATEVER YOU
ARRESTED HIM FOR,

39:34.663 --> 39:36.044
HE DIDN'T DO IT.
I SWEAR.

39:36.044 --> 39:37.916
HE'S A GREAT GUY.

39:37.916 --> 39:38.837
HE'S THE BEST GUY.

39:38.837 --> 39:40.258
CAN SHE SEE HIM?

39:40.258 --> 39:42.501
NOT YET. I STILL
NEED TO TALK TO HIM,

39:42.501 --> 39:44.923
BUT HE WON'T ANSWER
ANY OF MY QUESTIONS
WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY,

39:44.923 --> 39:47.135
SO I JUST CALLED
A PUBLIC DEFENDER.
HE'S ON HIS WAY.

39:47.135 --> 39:48.427
PUBLIC DEFENDER?

39:48.427 --> 39:49.928
WELL, HE DOESN'T
HAVE AN ATTORNEY, SO...

39:49.928 --> 39:52.100
OF COURSE NOT.
HE'S NEVER DONE
ANYTHING WRONG.

39:52.100 --> 39:53.892
WHITNEY,
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.143
WHY DID YOU ARREST HIM?

39:55.143 --> 39:56.725
LACEY, CAN YOU
TAKE HER HOME?

39:56.725 --> 39:58.977
I'M NOT LEAVING UNTIL
YOU TELL ME WHAT HE DID.

40:12.240 --> 40:13.662
( sighs )

40:33.812 --> 40:35.644
HEY.

40:35.644 --> 40:37.646
WHAT'S UP?

40:39.227 --> 40:41.820
I'M NOT STAYING
WITH FAMILY FRIENDS.

40:41.820 --> 40:43.482
I LIVE AT THE STABLES.

40:43.482 --> 40:45.824
OH.

40:45.824 --> 40:47.235
OKAY.

40:47.235 --> 40:48.987
THAT'S COOL.

40:48.987 --> 40:51.660
LOOK, I CAME TO GREEN GROVE
AFTER JUVIE

40:51.660 --> 40:54.833
BECAUSE DANNY MADE IT
SOUND GREAT.

40:54.833 --> 40:58.166
THE TOWN, AND THE PEOPLE.

40:59.788 --> 41:01.840
AND SO I GOT A ROOM
AT THE STABLE

41:01.840 --> 41:04.252
AND A PART-TIME JOB
TO PAY MY WAY.

41:04.252 --> 41:08.256
AND THEN I TOLD EVERYONE
THAT I WAS STAYING WITH
FAMILY FRIENDS,

41:08.256 --> 41:10.048
WHICH IS WHY
I CUT OUR DATE SHORT

41:10.048 --> 41:14.803
BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED
TO INVITE YOU BACK,

41:14.803 --> 41:16.224
BUT I FELT THAT--

41:27.065 --> 41:28.236
I DON'T CARE

41:28.236 --> 41:30.949
WHERE YOU LIVE
OR WHY YOU'RE HERE.

41:32.661 --> 41:35.413
I'M JUST REALLY
GLAD YOU ARE.
