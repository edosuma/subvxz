18:31.610 --> 18:33.278
Come here, you little...

18:34.779 --> 18:37.282
On second thought...

18:40.201 --> 18:43.079
I love a roller coaster.

18:43.663 --> 18:46.625
Too bad you missed the train.

Butterfingers!

Kewpie-dewpie number two-ee!

19:23.286 --> 19:27.499
You just don't like to play with dolls,
do you?

19:39.260 --> 19:41.096
- That must have been his stop.
-(WHIMPERING)

19:42.013 --> 19:45.308
On the contrary, Joker.
This is where you get off.

(GASPS)

20:20.176 --> 20:22.429
- Oh, my gosh!

20:25.265 --> 20:28.685
Reach for me. You have to trust me.

Jordan? Jordan.

21:14.939 --> 21:16.649
Oh, you're back.

21:21.488 --> 21:22.864
My boy is back.

21:24.491 --> 21:28.578
- I'm so sorry for running away.
- Please forgive me for the party.

21:28.828 --> 21:30.455
We can talk later.

21:30.872 --> 21:32.999
Right now, I want to give you

21:33.082 --> 21:36.628
