00:56.959 --> 00:58.510
Brake! Brake!

01:13.623 --> 01:15.577
What's going on?

01:37.833 --> 01:40.302
Keep your yankee hands
where we can see 'em

01:40.369 --> 01:41.386
And no one will get shot!

01:42.705 --> 01:43.972
We want your valuables.

01:44.039 --> 01:45.840
Give me your money, let's go.

01:45.892 --> 01:49.094
Let's go. Empty those pockets.
Let's go.

01:49.178 --> 01:51.062
Come on there.
Don't you hold out on me, now.

01:55.799 --> 01:56.843
Take this.

01:56.963 --> 01:58.737
Damn it, give me that gun!

01:58.821 --> 01:59.887
Damn--
give me that!

01:59.939 --> 02:01.823
What have you got?
Get back there!

02:01.890 --> 02:02.991
Blow the lock!

02:03.058 --> 02:03.992
All right.

02:04.059 --> 02:05.727
Don't shoot me.

02:07.896 --> 02:08.895
Whoo!

02:08.948 --> 02:11.833
What you think about that, huh?

02:11.900 --> 02:13.418
Bring that sack in here!

02:13.502 --> 02:15.337
Let's get moving.

02:15.404 --> 02:16.621
Come on!

02:16.706 --> 02:19.007
You'll be all right!
Let's go!

02:19.074 --> 02:20.241
Can you ride?

02:20.293 --> 02:21.843
Yeah.

02:21.910 --> 02:23.461
You on?
Yeah.

02:23.546 --> 02:26.715
All right, go, go, let's go.

02:26.766 --> 02:29.517
Come on, Mississippi!

02:29.585 --> 02:31.219
Come on!

02:31.270 --> 02:33.271
Come on, boys!

03:25.194 --> 03:28.863
One more man
on the front line. Let's go!

04:21.029 --> 04:24.433
Where's my money?!
Not again.

04:24.553 --> 04:25.557
Hey, you.

04:25.677 --> 04:26.499
Hey!

04:27.784 --> 04:29.816
Why don't you kill the bastard?

04:32.544 --> 04:34.045
All right, get back to work!

04:34.096 --> 04:35.480
Go to hell, Schmidt!

04:35.547 --> 04:38.182
Get back to work, you bastards!

04:43.989 --> 04:45.740
Ain't you gonna do something?

04:45.824 --> 04:49.027
Not my job.

04:53.949 --> 04:55.950
What exactly is your job?

04:56.035 --> 04:58.953
You'll see.

05:05.515 --> 05:09.053
Graders are averaging less
than 2,000 feet per day.

05:09.173 --> 05:12.383
And last week only
1,200 rails were spiked.

05:12.434 --> 05:14.919
1,800 ties laid.

05:16.355 --> 05:18.556
It's simply
not acceptable.

05:18.607 --> 05:20.692
Have you talked to
Mr. Schmidt about all this?

05:20.759 --> 05:24.562
Yes. He tipped his hat
at me and looked coy.

05:24.647 --> 05:28.199
I considered wiping the grin off
his face with the back of my hand.

05:33.622 --> 05:35.790
But I thought better of it.

05:35.874 --> 05:37.375
Good.

05:39.611 --> 05:41.713
Lily, you must remember
we males

05:41.780 --> 05:45.333
have very fragile egos.

05:45.417 --> 05:48.786
Especially when it comes to
dealing with a strong woman.

05:48.837 --> 05:51.556
Hmm.
You poor things.

05:51.623 --> 05:53.558
Mm.

05:53.625 --> 05:55.226
Well, today is payday.

05:55.293 --> 05:56.460
Tomorrow will be better.

05:56.512 --> 05:59.263
Wouldn't hold my
breath, Mr. Durant.

05:59.315 --> 06:01.816
Payroll train's
been robbed again.

06:01.900 --> 06:03.318
Damn it!

06:03.402 --> 06:06.821
Thom, now is the time.
Send word to Fort Kearny.

06:06.905 --> 06:08.690
We need protection.

06:08.774 --> 06:11.359
We can't. If our enemies
in Washington knew

06:11.443 --> 06:13.978
we can't protect
our own payroll...

06:16.865 --> 06:18.282
Mr. Ferguson.

06:18.334 --> 06:21.652
It seems we'll be needing
your services again.

06:21.704 --> 06:24.321
Happy to oblige, sir.

06:31.830 --> 06:34.165
What in the hell is that?

06:34.216 --> 06:35.266
This here?

06:35.333 --> 06:37.385
200s worth
of Yankee bank notes.

06:37.469 --> 06:39.604
That's your cut, Bohannon.

06:39.671 --> 06:42.690
I thought the idea was...

06:42.775 --> 06:45.560
We save our take
for the colony for Mexico.

06:45.644 --> 06:47.445
General Shelby and Magruder's
already down there.

06:47.512 --> 06:50.114
We're going to Mexico,
I assure you.

06:50.182 --> 06:52.516
I told you, these boys,
they don't get it.

06:52.568 --> 06:55.620
We're gonna need
this money for...

06:55.687 --> 06:57.321
Buying land, putting in crops,

06:57.373 --> 06:59.040
cattle, I don't know.

06:59.124 --> 07:00.691
Look, if we're gonna do this,

07:00.743 --> 07:02.160
we're gonna do it right.

07:02.211 --> 07:05.213
I call the shots here, not you.

07:05.297 --> 07:09.217
I'm just asking for...

07:09.301 --> 07:11.135
A little contribution.

07:11.203 --> 07:14.639
Then you can keep calling the shots.
How about that?

07:27.269 --> 07:29.020
You worry too much, Bohannon.

07:29.071 --> 07:30.855
Heh heh heh heh.

07:30.906 --> 07:33.357
More coffee?
We won last night.

07:33.409 --> 07:36.494
We deserve a chance to whoop
it up a little, right, boys?

07:36.561 --> 07:37.829
That's right!

07:37.896 --> 07:39.697
Viva LA Mexico.
Viva LA Mexico.

07:39.748 --> 07:42.233
Viva LA Mexico.

07:42.284 --> 07:43.701
Here you go, doc.

07:43.752 --> 07:45.736
Put that in the kitty.

07:45.788 --> 07:47.004
Another contribution, Cullen?

07:47.072 --> 07:49.173
Yeah.

07:49.241 --> 07:51.676
How's Tommy doing?

07:51.743 --> 07:54.128
He's dead.

07:59.318 --> 08:01.719
Yeah.

08:01.787 --> 08:04.689
Let's take a look
at that shoulder.

08:04.756 --> 08:06.474
Come on.

08:08.610 --> 08:11.428
I seem to remember

08:11.480 --> 08:15.867
pulling buckshot out of
your rear end once before.

08:15.934 --> 08:18.903
I must have patched you up

08:18.954 --> 08:22.457
more than any other kid
in meridian.

08:28.080 --> 08:31.165
Seems like a lifetime ago,
doesn't it?

08:33.784 --> 08:36.636
Well, it was.

08:37.789 --> 08:40.892
Hey, you know, Cullen,

08:40.976 --> 08:45.062
I had mixed feelings
about you joining up with us

08:45.130 --> 08:47.298
when we ran into you
down in meridian.

08:47.349 --> 08:49.433
Doc...

08:49.485 --> 08:52.803
You don't need to worry
about me, all right?

08:52.855 --> 08:57.742
I knew what I was getting into.

08:57.809 --> 08:59.310
Hey.

09:03.165 --> 09:05.500
To a new start

09:05.584 --> 09:08.703
down in old Mexico.

09:14.760 --> 09:17.494
Amen to that.

09:17.546 --> 09:22.433
And all them pretty senoritas.

09:31.176 --> 09:33.361
I'd like to talk to you
about the love of Christ.

09:33.445 --> 09:35.313
Brothers and sisters...

09:37.399 --> 09:38.866
Be firm.

09:41.036 --> 09:42.954
Be watchful.

09:43.021 --> 09:45.189
Stand firm in your faith.

09:45.240 --> 09:48.692
Act like men.

09:48.744 --> 09:50.545
Be strong.

09:52.364 --> 09:53.965
As Jesus turned,

09:54.032 --> 09:58.052
and seeing her, he said,

09:58.136 --> 10:00.338
"Take heart, daughter,

10:00.389 --> 10:02.557
our faith
has made you well."

10:02.641 --> 10:06.377
And the woman was made well.

10:06.428 --> 10:09.981
Buy some property in the
fastest-growing town in the territory.

10:10.048 --> 10:11.816
Right, chief.

10:11.883 --> 10:13.401
Start a business.

10:13.485 --> 10:15.519
Build a homestead.

10:15.571 --> 10:17.572
The finest tent...

10:17.656 --> 10:18.990
Right here, sir.

10:19.057 --> 10:21.075
Consider yourself
the proud owner

10:21.159 --> 10:23.327
of a prime piece
of railroad real estate.

10:27.732 --> 10:29.750
Step right up!

10:29.835 --> 10:32.870
Fine property,
waiting to be had.

10:32.921 --> 10:34.088
Lots for sale!
Lots for sale!

10:34.172 --> 10:37.875
What?
Mick.

10:37.926 --> 10:40.744
Shouldn't you be getting on with
that other business of yours?

10:40.796 --> 10:42.430
What other business?

10:44.082 --> 10:45.683
I don't much care, brother,

10:45.750 --> 10:47.635
as long as you get on with it.

10:53.108 --> 10:56.110
Right.

10:56.194 --> 10:58.479
Miss Ruth.

10:59.781 --> 11:01.782
What can I do for you today?

11:01.867 --> 11:05.286
It's about the rent,
I'm afraid.

11:08.273 --> 11:09.490
Late again?

11:09.574 --> 11:11.075
It's father.
He's not well.

11:11.126 --> 11:13.411
And if he's not well,
he can't preach.

11:13.462 --> 11:15.830
And if he can't preach, there's
no collection money coming in.

11:15.914 --> 11:18.132
I'm sympathetic
to your plight, miss Ruth,

11:18.216 --> 11:21.135
but, uh, there's only
so much I can do.

11:21.219 --> 11:24.088
I'm but a humble employee
of the railroad.

11:24.139 --> 11:27.291
I'm afraid I don't know
what to do.

11:29.294 --> 11:32.963
Maybe we could
discuss this at dinner.

11:33.015 --> 11:35.399
With my father there,
of course.

11:35.467 --> 11:39.303
I was thinking maybe
just the two of us.

11:39.354 --> 11:43.307
Mr. McGinnes, what sort of
girl do you think I am?

11:46.328 --> 11:49.914
I'll do my best
to have you the rent soon.

11:51.533 --> 11:54.618
You have my word.

11:54.670 --> 11:57.705
Yes.

12:16.841 --> 12:18.526
Mr. Gundersen.

12:19.361 --> 12:24.315
Ah. Mit Herredomme...

12:24.366 --> 12:26.117
What happened to him?

12:26.184 --> 12:30.154
Ah, stabbed in the eye
it would appear.

12:30.205 --> 12:33.824
Another victim of the
chaos that presides here.

12:33.875 --> 12:36.460
Bandits rob your trains,

12:36.528 --> 12:37.962
murderers run your streets,

12:38.029 --> 12:42.049
work has slowed to a--
to a crawl.

12:42.134 --> 12:45.636
You needn't remind me
of my own business, Gundersen.

12:45.703 --> 12:49.640
Sir, I have worked for you

12:49.707 --> 12:51.058
since before New York.

12:51.143 --> 12:55.513
I've always been faithful
and diligent, hmm?

12:55.564 --> 12:58.065
Let me help you.

12:58.150 --> 13:01.552
I appreciate it.

13:01.603 --> 13:05.222
But since those Irish boys
tarred and feathered you

13:05.273 --> 13:08.859
and ran you out of town
on a rail...

13:08.910 --> 13:12.747
Embrace this new job,
Gundersen.

13:12.831 --> 13:15.399
Lowly and noisome
though it may be,

13:15.450 --> 13:22.072
you provide an invaluable
service to the community.

13:28.770 --> 13:32.183
Community.

13:33.635 --> 13:35.770
Community.

13:35.854 --> 13:37.688
♪ Hurrah, hurrah

13:37.755 --> 13:39.557
♪ for southern rights, hurrah

13:39.624 --> 13:41.525
♪ hurrah for
the Bonnie blue flag ♪

13:41.593 --> 13:42.893
♪ that bears a single star

13:47.199 --> 13:49.567
Think they would have
learned their damn lesson.

13:49.618 --> 13:51.202
Especially after
general Sherman

13:51.269 --> 13:53.704
had that little
barbecue of his.

13:59.995 --> 14:02.963
Just ignore 'em, Cullen.

14:05.417 --> 14:08.169
I can't.

14:16.761 --> 14:19.463
How you boys don'?

14:22.567 --> 14:24.635
Ohh!

14:24.686 --> 14:26.803
Aah!

14:34.696 --> 14:36.697
Come here, boy.

14:49.377 --> 14:51.846
You gonna feel that tomorrow.

14:51.930 --> 14:57.218
Them Yankee farm boys are gonna
feel it a whole lot worse.

15:01.339 --> 15:02.857
Ahh.

15:02.941 --> 15:06.843
Your father had
a penchant for spirits

15:06.895 --> 15:08.479
and a good fight.

15:08.530 --> 15:11.866
Like father like son, huh?

15:11.950 --> 15:14.201
I said a good fight.

15:14.286 --> 15:16.853
Tell me, Cullen,

15:16.905 --> 15:18.956
what did you gain in there?

15:19.023 --> 15:21.692
You teach those Yankee
boys a lesson, did you?

15:21.743 --> 15:23.577
Something like that, yeah.

15:23.662 --> 15:26.547
It's you who needs the lesson.

15:26.631 --> 15:28.916
You are better than
them damn fools in there.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.302
If they's fools, what you
don' ridin' with 'em?

15:31.369 --> 15:33.870
Well, sad as it is, right now,

15:33.922 --> 15:37.641
those boys are the closest
thing to family I got.

15:40.262 --> 15:43.063
They dug up my family, doc.

15:54.225 --> 15:56.911
Carpetbaggers,

15:56.995 --> 15:58.529
they tore up plenty of graves

15:58.580 --> 16:00.531
in our hometowns
looking for loot.

16:00.582 --> 16:04.201
They dug up my boy.

16:04.252 --> 16:06.837
My Mary.

16:11.676 --> 16:14.345
What kind of man does that?

17:20.474 --> 17:22.229
Elam?

17:22.280 --> 17:24.765
In the flesh.

17:25.648 --> 17:28.349
Why are you here?

17:28.401 --> 17:30.653
Just passing through.

17:32.572 --> 17:35.574
You still working
for Mr. Durant?

17:35.659 --> 17:38.777
I'm on the job right now.

17:40.330 --> 17:43.616
I guess you got
what you wanted, then.

17:50.790 --> 17:53.626
Hello, Mr. Ferguson.

17:53.710 --> 17:58.764
It's a surprise to see you
again, sir.

17:58.849 --> 18:01.934
What brings you
to our fair town?

18:02.018 --> 18:06.021
He's on railroad business
for Mr. Durant.

18:06.089 --> 18:09.424
Ah. I, too,
work for Mr. Durant.

18:09.476 --> 18:13.195
He appointed me
station agent here.

18:13.263 --> 18:15.865
Congratulations.

18:15.932 --> 18:18.367
To both of you.

18:19.452 --> 18:22.204
Would you like to join us
for supper?

18:24.875 --> 18:28.043
Well, maybe
some other time, then.

18:31.665 --> 18:33.716
Yeah.

18:33.783 --> 18:35.968
Maybe some other time.

18:54.804 --> 18:56.655
Wake up!

18:56.740 --> 18:58.574
Get up!

18:58.641 --> 19:00.309
Supply train
leavin' in 5 minutes!

19:00.360 --> 19:02.611
Ain't all of you
ain't got a job.

19:02.662 --> 19:05.981
Get up, you bastards!

19:10.170 --> 19:12.705
Penny is dead!

19:15.709 --> 19:18.493
Ginny?
What is it?

19:28.838 --> 19:32.174
Get back to work.
There's men waitin'.

19:56.216 --> 19:59.418
Ohh...

20:43.013 --> 20:45.580
Such a terrible thing.

20:45.632 --> 20:47.933
Truly it is, brother.

20:48.018 --> 20:50.352
Tragic.

20:51.805 --> 20:53.689
But this could be
the opportunity

20:53.756 --> 20:55.757
we've been looking for.

21:04.951 --> 21:08.904
You ain't gonna
believe this, boys.

21:08.955 --> 21:12.274
There's a nigger guard
in the payroll car.

21:12.325 --> 21:15.377
Let me take point, captain.
Shoot that buck dead.

21:15.445 --> 21:18.947
Let me see him.

21:23.286 --> 21:28.640
I've been the first man
through the door all along.

21:28.725 --> 21:32.127
I think I've earned the right
to take him down.

21:32.178 --> 21:35.180
All right, Bohannon,
you got it.

21:49.612 --> 21:52.865
No, don't.

21:59.122 --> 22:02.174
I don't know why they bother
me with these things.

22:02.258 --> 22:03.825
Thomas, what is it?

22:03.877 --> 22:07.679
It seems a woman
has been murdered.

22:07.764 --> 22:11.016
A first for
our little community.

22:11.101 --> 22:13.435
She was just a whore,
but still...

22:13.503 --> 22:16.021
Do they know who killed her?

22:16.106 --> 22:19.892
Certainly one of our employees.

22:22.312 --> 22:27.783
Lily, you don't have to
concern yourself with this.

22:27.850 --> 22:30.119
Thomas, this man
needs to be found.

22:30.186 --> 22:32.321
He will be punished.

22:32.372 --> 22:34.289
I'm afraid nobody's
going to care very much

22:34.357 --> 22:36.024
about the killing
of a prostitute.

22:36.075 --> 22:38.660
Thomas, you hang
horse thieves here.

22:38.711 --> 22:41.663
Are you saying horses are more
valuable than these women?

22:41.714 --> 22:45.250
Sad to say, but yes.
Yes, they are.

22:47.220 --> 22:48.870
You don't mean that.

22:48.922 --> 22:51.056
Lily, she chose
a dangerous profession.

22:51.141 --> 22:55.227
With choices come consequences.

22:55.311 --> 23:00.065
Let's eat our
breakfast, shall we?

23:05.738 --> 23:07.439
Now!

23:10.410 --> 23:11.944
Hyah!

23:19.752 --> 23:22.337
Hyah!

23:22.405 --> 23:25.174
Hyah!

23:29.879 --> 23:32.714
All right,
this here's a stickup!

23:32.765 --> 23:34.716
All right, everybody,
wallet, watch, jewelry,

23:34.767 --> 23:37.853
put it in the bag right now.

23:37.920 --> 23:39.438
Come on, now.
Don't be foolish.

23:39.522 --> 23:41.356
Open up!

23:41.424 --> 23:42.924
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

23:42.976 --> 23:44.610
Open the damn door!

23:44.694 --> 23:45.927
Bohannon?

23:45.979 --> 23:47.863
Damn right. Open up.

23:50.200 --> 23:52.951
Son, you want to sit down?

23:54.904 --> 23:57.122
What the hell you don' here?

23:57.207 --> 24:00.108
Trying to keep you
from getting yourself killed.

24:00.159 --> 24:01.710
Get that gun out of my face
and give me the payroll.

24:01.777 --> 24:03.278
You hand that money over
I can't.

24:03.329 --> 24:04.580
Or I'll kill you my damn self.

24:04.631 --> 24:06.381
Go on, then.

24:06.449 --> 24:08.417
Pull the trigger.

24:08.468 --> 24:11.286
What the hell's going on in there?

24:12.955 --> 24:15.724
You stupid son of a...

24:17.960 --> 24:19.978
Aim high.

24:20.063 --> 24:22.814
Keep shooting.

24:22.899 --> 24:24.733
Right now!
Put it in the bag.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.818
He's got the drop on me!

24:26.903 --> 24:28.153
Come on! We gotta
get off this train!

24:28.238 --> 24:30.355
Come on.

24:33.910 --> 24:35.661
Uhh!

24:35.745 --> 24:39.197
Let's get outta here!

24:41.317 --> 24:42.984
Come on, boys.
Let's ride!

24:43.036 --> 24:45.153
Hyah! Hyah!

24:57.748 --> 24:59.866
Come in.

24:59.917 --> 25:02.035
Eh...Tor Gundersen, ma'am.

25:02.086 --> 25:04.971
Here to empty your Jerry pot.

25:05.039 --> 25:07.424
Thank you, Mr. Gundersen.

25:07.508 --> 25:09.926
Not necessary, ma'am.

25:10.011 --> 25:12.596
It's my job.
We all must do our jobs, huh?

25:12.680 --> 25:18.151
Yes, but...
I imagine it's hard with...

25:18.219 --> 25:19.486
Considering--

25:19.553 --> 25:20.887
how far I've fallen.

25:20.938 --> 25:23.690
Look h...how far
you rose up.

25:23.741 --> 25:26.359
Hmm? Mm.

25:26.410 --> 25:27.744
Aye.

25:27.828 --> 25:30.864
We all do what we must
to carry on.

25:30.915 --> 25:32.415
Hmm.

25:33.834 --> 25:38.404
Mr. Gundersen.
The woman, um...

25:38.456 --> 25:40.006
The one they killed...

25:40.074 --> 25:42.175
The whore?

25:42.243 --> 25:44.127
What--what will happen
to her?

25:44.212 --> 25:48.181
She'll have a whore's grave.

26:00.261 --> 26:03.813
See that she gets
a proper burial.

26:05.366 --> 26:07.450
Ah...

26:09.103 --> 26:14.791
The reverend and I will--
will bury her 6 feet down, eh?

26:14.875 --> 26:16.910
Like a proper lady.

26:16.961 --> 26:19.546
Thank you.

26:19.613 --> 26:20.997
Mm.

26:22.116 --> 26:23.500
Have a good day.

26:32.459 --> 26:34.627
Good morning, father.

26:36.230 --> 26:38.431
I'm preparing--

26:39.967 --> 26:40.984
For Sunday's sermon.

26:41.068 --> 26:43.570
Matthew 7:13.

26:45.072 --> 26:48.308
You sure you're up to it?

26:48.359 --> 26:52.028
I am, Ruth.

26:56.200 --> 27:00.253
Then I suppose you won't
be wanting this today.

27:06.927 --> 27:10.013
I know what you're doing.

27:10.097 --> 27:12.048
And what is that?

27:12.133 --> 27:17.337
You--heh heh-- you don't
believe in me anymore.

27:21.859 --> 27:24.277
Of course I do.

27:26.314 --> 27:30.700
Then we--we don't need--

27:30.785 --> 27:33.853
we don't need this.

27:33.904 --> 27:36.406
Praise Jesus.

27:36.490 --> 27:39.209
It's wonderful.

27:40.795 --> 27:43.963
I'll pour it out, then.

27:46.500 --> 27:50.036
Y-you can't.

27:50.087 --> 27:53.973
I--I'll have one last drink.

28:25.790 --> 28:27.957
Ahh...

28:34.048 --> 28:36.099
Let's go to Mexico, boys.

28:36.183 --> 28:37.550
Right now.
Whoa.

28:37.618 --> 28:40.653
Slow down there, son.

28:40.721 --> 28:44.190
We'll take a paddle steamer
to Louisiana.

28:44.258 --> 28:46.259
Texas-New Orleans railroad
from there to Galveston.

28:46.310 --> 28:48.895
Hell, it ain't but a 300-mile
ride to Mexico from there.

28:48.963 --> 28:50.763
That's a good idea.

28:50.815 --> 28:53.366
Right after we take down
another train.

28:53.434 --> 28:57.487
We got enough money.

28:57.571 --> 28:59.772
Besides, they're expecting us.

28:59.824 --> 29:02.575
The guard on that last train
was waiting for us.

29:02.626 --> 29:05.378
You scared, Bohannon?

29:05.446 --> 29:07.714
Is that it?

29:11.051 --> 29:14.954
You're treading
on some skinny ice, son.

29:17.475 --> 29:20.460
You want to do this,
Mississippi?

29:27.351 --> 29:31.070
Why didn't you draw down
on that darkie?

29:33.574 --> 29:36.693
Just the way
it played out, I guess.

29:41.982 --> 29:43.917
All right.

29:43.984 --> 29:46.786
One more train.

29:46.837 --> 29:49.255
Then we go to Mexico.

29:54.628 --> 29:57.764
Cullen Bohannon is robbing my
trains and you didn't kill him?

29:57.831 --> 30:01.601
You hired me to protect your
payroll and that's what I done.

30:01.685 --> 30:03.836
Yes, you did at that.

30:03.888 --> 30:05.638
Maybe I could do more
for you, Mr. Durant.

30:05.689 --> 30:07.140
More?

30:07.191 --> 30:10.360
This town's goin'
to hell in a handbasket.

30:10.444 --> 30:11.778
Your point is?

30:11.845 --> 30:14.847
I'm the man
that could fix things.

30:14.899 --> 30:18.735
I have no doubt you are up
to the job, Mr. Ferguson.

30:18.819 --> 30:20.853
But it's not as simple
as all that.

30:20.905 --> 30:23.623
Maybe if I was
a few shades lighter?

30:23.690 --> 30:27.026
I won't lie to you--yes.

30:27.077 --> 30:29.879
I can do it.

30:29.964 --> 30:32.865
All I need is a chance.

30:34.718 --> 30:37.470
Let me think about it.

30:37.538 --> 30:40.723
Appreciate that.

30:47.047 --> 30:49.025
Bohannon.

30:49.550 --> 30:51.717
I should have known.

30:52.770 --> 30:56.222
Another brick on
his road to hell.

31:06.102 --> 31:08.038
The man did this
would be dead already

31:08.142 --> 31:10.777
if the Swede
was still running things.

31:10.828 --> 31:12.070
I miss him.

31:12.190 --> 31:14.070
The Swede put a thumpin'
on you, Nell.

31:14.190 --> 31:15.994
Hell, that was just business.

31:16.100 --> 31:18.402
You think I don't beat on my
girls when they hold out on me?

31:18.453 --> 31:22.456
That man ran this shithole
of a town like a fine watch.

31:22.540 --> 31:24.408
Well, it's
your lucky day, Nell.

31:24.459 --> 31:26.276
'Cause that's why
me and Mickey are here.

31:26.328 --> 31:28.946
How the hell are you two
skinny chaps

31:28.997 --> 31:31.298
gonna protect my knocking shop?

31:31.383 --> 31:32.633
Give us a chance.

31:32.717 --> 31:34.752
What have you got to lose?

31:34.803 --> 31:36.637
We're in, boyo.

31:36.721 --> 31:39.640
Same deal as the Swede--
10% of the take,

31:39.724 --> 31:41.342
after expenses.

31:41.426 --> 31:42.593
That's great.

31:42.644 --> 31:44.228
There's one small catch.

31:44.295 --> 31:45.479
You have to kill that man
that did her dollymop.

31:45.563 --> 31:47.564
What?

31:49.234 --> 31:50.901
I ain't no killer.

31:50.969 --> 31:53.637
Mick, that's what you said
in Boston.

31:53.688 --> 31:56.740
But that was different.

31:56.808 --> 31:59.994
Things...got out of hand.

32:02.831 --> 32:05.032
I ain't a killer.

32:21.049 --> 32:24.468
Cullen, you need to get on
this horse

32:24.519 --> 32:28.472
and ride away from here
as fast as you can.

32:28.523 --> 32:32.676
Them Alabama boys are none too
happy with you right about now.

32:32.727 --> 32:35.112
Doc...

32:39.484 --> 32:42.236
If you'll excuse me,
I got a train to rob.

32:52.247 --> 32:55.699
Cullen, this ain't
gonna end well.

32:55.750 --> 32:58.535
It rarely does.

32:59.754 --> 33:03.874

Watches in the bag.

36:14.365 --> 36:16.399
I know you got a watch.
Don't give me that.

36:16.451 --> 36:19.920
You know, man it smell
like Yankee in here, don't it?

36:20.004 --> 36:21.738
Ma'am, I need you to put
that purse in this bag.

36:21.789 --> 36:25.408
Take the ring off your finger!

36:25.460 --> 36:26.760
Hurry up!

36:26.844 --> 36:28.011
I'm gonna put a hole
in your boy's head

36:28.079 --> 36:30.347
if you don't give me that ring.

36:30.414 --> 36:31.715
Hurry up!

36:31.766 --> 36:33.884
Hurry up! Try harder!

36:33.935 --> 36:35.936
You want a dead child
in your lap?

36:36.020 --> 36:38.222
I will kill this Yankee spawn.

36:38.273 --> 36:40.057
Take that ring off your finger!

36:40.108 --> 36:41.591
Get that ring off your finger!

36:41.643 --> 36:43.110
Do you want this boy to die?!

36:43.194 --> 36:45.529
You better stand down, son.

36:45.596 --> 36:47.931
Last chance.

36:49.934 --> 36:53.120
No. It's yours.

37:04.448 --> 37:05.966
Hey.

37:06.050 --> 37:07.784
Shit.

37:15.265 --> 37:17.283
They're watching us.

37:18.985 --> 37:21.036
I can feel it.

37:22.889 --> 37:24.408
After what happened
to you and Robert,

37:24.528 --> 37:28.244
I can understand your unease.

37:28.295 --> 37:30.731
We surveyed this area.

37:30.851 --> 37:33.731
The Sioux believe the land
across that river

37:33.851 --> 37:34.981
is sacred...

37:36.266 --> 37:38.807
Where the earth touches heaven.

37:40.390 --> 37:44.593
Robert wanted to avoid it.

37:44.644 --> 37:48.264
What do you think?

37:48.315 --> 37:53.819
My husband was rarely wrong
on these matters.

37:53.904 --> 37:57.656
I know they're over there
waiting for us.

37:57.741 --> 37:59.474
We can't ignore them.

37:59.526 --> 38:02.328
But they will be
the least of our troubles

38:02.412 --> 38:05.698
if we don't get
this railroad under control.

38:21.166 --> 38:23.464
Unless you got a bee
in your throat,

38:23.584 --> 38:27.002
best cease that hum sound.

38:29.773 --> 38:32.775
A happy man's got a right
to hum, all right?

38:32.842 --> 38:37.062
Son, you're getting set
to be hanged.

38:38.481 --> 38:43.152
Nah, they won't hang me.

38:43.203 --> 38:45.788
Shoot me, most likely.

38:53.863 --> 38:55.197
Ha ha ha ha ha!

38:55.248 --> 38:58.200
♪ Take me home
to the land of cotton ♪

38:58.251 --> 39:01.637
♪ old times there
are not forgotten ♪

39:01.704 --> 39:05.174
♪ look away, look away

39:05.225 --> 39:06.981
♪ look away...

39:07.101 --> 39:08.715
♪ Dixieland

39:12.215 --> 39:14.717
Shut up.

39:24.094 --> 39:26.512
I don't...

39:26.596 --> 39:29.648
I don't know what to say
about this.

39:29.733 --> 39:33.068
Whore. Hmm?

39:34.988 --> 39:40.242
Well, it was a whore who...

39:40.310 --> 39:45.247
Bathed the feet of Jesus
with--with her hair.

39:46.866 --> 39:49.368
Yeah. Amen.

39:56.126 --> 39:58.160
Huh?

40:01.765 --> 40:03.665
Yah.

40:03.717 --> 40:06.685
Uh...

40:08.838 --> 40:14.310
Father, accept this whore
into the ground

40:14.361 --> 40:17.780
so that her corruption
may be completed.

40:17.847 --> 40:21.784
May her soul
be eternally forgotten.

40:21.851 --> 40:28.190
May we be cleansed
of her memory.

40:28.258 --> 40:30.367
Yah.

40:30.487 --> 40:34.880
These things in your name.
Humbly.

40:37.083 --> 40:39.218
Amen.

40:39.302 --> 40:42.371
Amen.

40:44.257 --> 40:47.209
Dig! Dig.

40:47.260 --> 40:48.644
New graves, sir.

40:48.711 --> 40:53.015
Many new graves.

40:53.066 --> 40:54.817
We shall plant our--

40:54.884 --> 40:58.854
our strange crop,

40:58.905 --> 41:01.023
and the lord...

41:01.074 --> 41:02.825
The lord...

41:02.892 --> 41:08.230
will pour forth
his bounty upon us.

42:09.792 --> 42:12.561
Hey, Johnny Reb!

42:14.180 --> 42:17.632
Time to wake up!

42:17.684 --> 42:20.602
You better start
singin' "Dixie."

42:20.653 --> 42:23.572
'Cause you're next!

42:25.575 --> 42:27.743
Aim...

42:27.810 --> 42:29.495
Fire!

42:29.579 --> 42:30.913
Aah!
