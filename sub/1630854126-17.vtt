Are you kidding?
He was the first one

16:57.183 --> 16:59.477
to call Jacob "Squidward."
Consider Joshua re-enrolled.

16:59.477 --> 17:02.104
He's going to be so happy
to be back at Abbott.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.691
Legendary Charter--

17:05.691 --> 17:06.859
if anyone's going
to take advantage

17:06.859 --> 17:08.152
of this school district,
it's me.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.654
Now, you two need
to get on board.

17:09.654 --> 17:11.155
Who do we need
to fight first?

17:11.155 --> 17:14.325
Well, I am not sure
about the journey there,

17:14.325 --> 17:17.161
but amen
to the destination.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.413
Welcome to the team.

17:19.413 --> 17:21.540
I'll take the ribs.
Thank you.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.044
What's up, Janine?

17:25.044 --> 17:27.463
<i>And</i> Gregory?
You a Bone Bro, too?

17:27.463 --> 17:29.465
Hey, Maurice. We were hoping
that we could talk.

17:29.465 --> 17:30.258
Yeah.

17:30.258 --> 17:32.134
Why so macabre, bro?

17:32.134 --> 17:34.178
We got jalapeño poppers
on deck.

17:34.178 --> 17:38.182
Look, you know how much
I value our friendship.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.726
I don't think I've ever heard
you say that, but sure.

17:40.726 --> 17:43.854
And you know how much
I value our, uh...

17:43.854 --> 17:45.356
Situationship.
Yes.

17:45.356 --> 17:48.067
And you're really a--
a great guy. It's--

17:48.067 --> 17:51.362
We got drunk and kisses
at the confrontation conference.

17:51.362 --> 17:52.863
We kissed
at the teachers' conference,

17:52.863 --> 17:53.864
but it meant nothing.

17:53.864 --> 17:55.533
Yeah.
It meant nothing.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.535
Like, yeah, less than nothing, right?

17:57.535 --> 17:58.911
You know, like, what--
what-- what would you say

17:58.911 --> 18:00.663
would be something
that's less than nothing?

18:00.663 --> 18:01.747
Negative nothing.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.249
Yep. That.

18:03.249 --> 18:04.792
We are so, so sorry.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.712
Very sorry.

18:07.712 --> 18:10.131
Hey, it's fine, man.
Things happen.

18:10.131 --> 18:11.924
You know, I would tell you
about the last holiday party

18:11.924 --> 18:15.177
we had at the UPS,
but I don't remember it.

18:15.177 --> 18:17.138
I woke up in a box
on a porch.

18:17.138 --> 18:18.347
You know, thankfully,
my co-workers used

18:18.347 --> 18:20.725
packing peanuts,
so it went smooth.

18:20.725 --> 18:23.436
Well, you know,
we never meant to hurt you.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.021
Nah, we're good.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.939
It's all water
under Adele's bridge.

18:29.650 --> 18:30.985
You're taking this
very well.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.653
Yeah, I'm a chill guy.

18:32.653 --> 18:33.988
I mean, if you say it meant nothing,

18:33.988 --> 18:35.573
there's no reason that
we can't continue to date.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.992
We're good.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.328
I was thinking that maybe
we aren't

18:40.328 --> 18:43.623
the best fit
for each other.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.833
Wait, wait, wait.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.002
You just wanted to break up
with me in front of Gregory?

18:48.002 --> 18:50.379
That is what it looks like,
but no.

18:50.379 --> 18:51.839
That was not our intention.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.132
Oh, y'all are sick.

18:55.551 --> 19:00.139
Look, man, you can have my baby,
but not my baby backs.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.849
Huh?
I'm staying.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.643
Please leave.

19:03.643 --> 19:04.977
That's fair.

19:07.772 --> 19:09.607
And I did enjoy our time--
Can I get some more ranch?

19:12.151 --> 19:14.487
Okay, thank you all
for coming.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.073
I just want to give a special
shout-out to Mural Arts.

19:17.073 --> 19:18.824
Thank you for coming back
and helping us

19:18.824 --> 19:21.452
with this very important work
on such late notice.

19:21.452 --> 19:23.788
Well, one of your teachers
made a strong argument

19:23.788 --> 19:26.332
that we return.

19:26.332 --> 19:29.085
I sat down with my class,
and after a lengthy discussion,

19:29.085 --> 19:32.755
they arrived at an idea
that they really believe in.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.131
So, without further ado...

19:35.591 --> 19:36.592
Let's go!

19:36.592 --> 19:38.260
[ All cheering ]

19:38.260 --> 19:40.304
Well, I guess
this Silly Sock brigade

19:40.304 --> 19:42.431
is this generation's
"Rug Vermin."

19:42.431 --> 19:44.934
"Rugrats," and, um, wow.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.727
This is gonna be here forever.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.312
I have never been happier to be
on the first floor.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.814
I know.
[ Laughs ]

19:49.814 --> 19:52.149
So, I guess you just
totally gave in, huh?

19:52.149 --> 19:53.651
Actually,
if you take a closer look

19:53.651 --> 19:55.152
at the socks' social fabric...

19:55.152 --> 19:57.405
Yeah, move.
...it is a mosaic,

19:57.405 --> 20:01.158
and each of the kids
got their own tile.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.743
Oh.
Whose is this one?

20:02.743 --> 20:04.745
This is me as a doctor,
which is what I want to be

20:04.745 --> 20:05.496
when I grow up.

20:05.496 --> 20:06.997
Aww.

20:06.997 --> 20:09.417
And this is me
as the first

20:09.417 --> 20:10.668
Black female president astronaut.

20:10.668 --> 20:12.461
Barbara: Ah.

20:12.461 --> 20:15.172
This is me
in my favorite class--

20:15.172 --> 20:16.590
Mr. C's class.

20:16.590 --> 20:18.259
I'm gonna be a teacher.

20:18.259 --> 20:20.302
Wait. So you're trying
to grow up to be broke?

20:20.302 --> 20:22.263
[ Laughter ]
Hey, Josh.

20:22.263 --> 20:25.099
Um, I know you weren't here
to help paint the mural,

20:25.099 --> 20:29.019
but I think we've got
some space for you over there.

20:29.019 --> 20:31.063
Thank you, Mr. C.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.857
Nice job, man.
I'm impressed.

20:32.857 --> 20:34.066
I was looking for
a new paint color

20:34.066 --> 20:35.776
for my bathroom downstairs.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.278
Wait, your bathroom where?

20:37.278 --> 20:38.779
Shut up, Janine.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.114
I'm Jacob.

20:42.533 --> 20:44.952
That's true. My favorite day
of the week is Wednesday.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.871
I didn't know that. Yeah.

20:46.871 --> 20:48.247
What are y'all doing?

20:48.247 --> 20:49.415
Oh, we're taking
a personality quiz

20:49.415 --> 20:51.208
to see which
Silly Sock we are.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.043
Mm.
Except me.

20:53.043 --> 20:55.588
I'm not giving info to some
bankrupt hippie data farm.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.256
Too late.
I already did it for you.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.217
What can I say?
I'm a stereotypical Nene Sock.

21:00.217 --> 21:02.553
You are Miss Ing Sock.
Mm-hmm.

21:02.553 --> 21:03.763
I knew it.

21:03.763 --> 21:08.225
And I am the glamorous,
yet substantive Toeprah.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.269
You want to get in on this,
Gregory?

21:10.269 --> 21:11.520
Yeah, I'm gonna pass.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.189
I took it for you.

21:13.189 --> 21:14.315
I don't really care
what kind of sock I am.

21:14.315 --> 21:15.941
You are a Toeseph.
That's ridiculous!

21:15.941 --> 21:17.276
I'm a textbook Toesha.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.278
[ Laughs ]
Toeseph says exactly that

21:19.278 --> 21:20.905
in episode 86.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.323
[ All laugh except Gregory ]

21:22.323 --> 21:23.407
That's so Toeseph.
