(doorbell rings)

00:54.100 --> 00:56.033
(doorbell rings)

00:57.934 --> 01:00.133
Somebody get that.
I'll just be a minute.

01:00.200 --> 01:04.700
-I'm not dressed yet. Rose?
-Sophia, would you mind?

01:05.567 --> 01:07.934
Why not? I'm over 80.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.367
I've had plenty of chances to rest
in my lifetime.

01:12.100 --> 01:15.367
Today alone, I probably
sat down three, four times.

01:16.300 --> 01:18.633
I'll answer the door,
then I'll hot tar the roof.

01:20.967 --> 01:22.033
-Hello.
-Hello.

01:22.533 --> 01:25.133
Hello. Tell me,
how many of me do you see?

01:27.200 --> 01:29.767
-We're twins.
-We're here to see Blanche.

01:29.834 --> 01:31.767
She's back on the vitamins. Come in.

01:35.667 --> 01:38.166
-Hello, Rob.
-Hello, Blanche.

01:38.233 --> 01:41.867
You didn't tell me your brother Bob
was a twin.

01:41.934 --> 01:44.700
You didn't tell me your roommate
was grandma Moses.

01:45.967 --> 01:49.300
Why don't I fix your face
so you don't look like twins?

01:49.367 --> 01:50.700
Sophia.

01:51.100 --> 01:54.967
-This is Dorothy's mother.
-Dorothy will be joining us tonight.

01:55.033 --> 02:00.133
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
This is Rob and his brother Bob.

02:00.200 --> 02:04.200
I swear I've seen you before.
Oh, there you are!

02:06.200 --> 02:09.633
That's a joke.
Blanche didn't mention you're twins.

02:09.700 --> 02:14.133
-I never met Bob until tonight.
-I told you we were exactly alike.

02:17.700 --> 02:20.133
You'll be thanking me for years.

02:21.867 --> 02:23.367
(doorbell rings)

02:23.433 --> 02:26.500
At least we won't argue over who has
the cuter date.

02:27.567 --> 02:30.467
-Oh, Stanley.
-We need to talk.

02:30.533 --> 02:34.233
Stan's her ex-husband.
Biggest loser you'll ever see. Hi.

02:34.300 --> 02:36.467
Always good to see you, too.

02:36.533 --> 02:39.400
I'm going out. We'll talk another time.

02:39.467 --> 02:43.533
In future, I'd appreciate some notice
before you drop by.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.033
Let's say one, two, six months.

02:46.500 --> 02:51.266
I have papers we need to go over
before the surgery.

02:51.333 --> 02:52.333
Surgery?

02:52.600 --> 02:54.800
Finally going ahead
with that hair transplant?

02:55.767 --> 02:57.700
Not everybody knows this isn't real.

02:57.767 --> 03:00.834
Oh, please.
Stevie Wonder could tell it's a rug.

03:02.367 --> 03:08.567
I wish it were only a hair transplant.
Look, go out, have fun.

03:08.633 --> 03:10.700
I'll still be here when
you return, God willing.

03:10.767 --> 03:14.667
We're seeing Merv Griffin in the crucible.
I'll risk it.

03:15.533 --> 03:16.667
Come on. Let's go.

03:18.066 --> 03:23.400
I made these plans a week ago.
How can I disappoint Rob?

03:23.467 --> 03:24.700
-Bob.
-Bob.

03:26.500 --> 03:27.500
Stan.

03:28.266 --> 03:31.934
Stan, are we talking life and death?

03:32.500 --> 03:35.066
The doctors say I'm lucky to be talking.

03:36.233 --> 03:37.400
Hi, everybody.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.333
Rose, could you
take my place with Rob?

03:40.400 --> 03:41.533
-Bob.
-Bob.

03:42.800 --> 03:46.467
I'm driving the bookmobile
for the grief center.

03:46.533 --> 03:48.467
I thought you do that during the day.

03:48.533 --> 03:53.200
I got tied up at work and didn't have
time. Now I feel so guilty.

03:53.266 --> 03:57.100
There are so many depressed people
with nothing to read.

03:57.700 --> 04:02.233
When I'm depressed, I can't read. I knit.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.700
Maybe I should drive a knitmobile.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.400
Maybe she should drive a nitwitmobile.

04:11.266 --> 04:13.333
You'd better call a friend.

04:13.400 --> 04:17.667
Boys, would you mind waiting in the car?
I want to talk to Dorothy.

04:17.734 --> 04:18.734
Sure. Come on, Rob.

04:18.800 --> 04:19.934
-Bob!
-Bob!

04:21.300 --> 04:26.233
I think I have to stay.
I'm sure you can get somebody.

04:26.300 --> 04:29.667
I confess I have mixed feelings
about calling anybody.

04:29.734 --> 04:32.600
There's something strangely provocative
about this evening.

04:32.934 --> 04:36.133
I'd never have a relationship
with both twins at the same time.

04:36.200 --> 04:37.400
That would be obscene.

04:38.734 --> 04:40.800
Unless, of course, it was tastefully done.

04:42.266 --> 04:44.934
What do you want to see me about?

04:45.000 --> 04:46.867
Not now. Finish your thought, Blanche.

04:47.934 --> 04:49.333
Into the kitchen, Stanley.

04:50.066 --> 04:53.066
I'll just send one home.
Only which one?

04:53.600 --> 04:56.734
I used to have this recurring dream
about twins.

04:57.066 --> 04:59.000
They always killed each other over me.

05:01.100 --> 05:02.266
Maybe I'll drive.

05:03.633 --> 05:05.166
I have a recurring dream.

05:05.233 --> 05:08.066
John Cameron Swayze
straps a Timex to my chin

05:08.133 --> 05:10.133
and tosses me across an icy pond.

05:10.900 --> 05:13.500
I looked in a book of symbols.
It wasn't there.

05:15.433 --> 05:16.633
That's it. I'm done.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.367
What should I do, bring down a curtain?

05:22.967 --> 05:26.700
Bypass surgery.
You mean, heart bypass?

05:26.767 --> 05:29.700
The doctor says the problem's been
brewing for years.

05:29.767 --> 05:32.433
I don't understand.
I exercise, eat healthy.

05:32.500 --> 05:36.600
Your idea of healthy eating
is taking the skin off a knockwurst.

05:38.133 --> 05:41.600
Whatever.
He says I don't have a choice anymore.

05:42.033 --> 05:43.033
Oh, Dorothy.

05:43.100 --> 05:45.934
You have to try to pull yourself together.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.767
Don't worry. I'm a survivor.

05:49.100 --> 05:51.667
The cat who's going to cut me is primo.

05:51.734 --> 05:55.600
I said pull yourself together,
not talk like Sammy Davis Jr.

05:57.033 --> 06:01.033
I only meant that the operation
is a very common procedure.

06:01.333 --> 06:03.400
Everything will turn out fine.

06:04.066 --> 06:06.667
On the other hand,
they are cracking open my chest

06:06.734 --> 06:09.867
and slicing my heart
like the lox platter at Wolfie's.

06:10.767 --> 06:12.166
Good. Someone's going for lox.

06:12.233 --> 06:13.900
And get some bagels, an assortment.

06:14.800 --> 06:18.000
Ma, Stanley's having
bypass surgery on Friday.

06:18.066 --> 06:20.533
I'm not asking him to walk.
He can take the car.

06:22.400 --> 06:26.033
No poppy seeds.
They get caught under my dentures.

06:27.300 --> 06:30.233
At least you could pretend
you're concerned.

06:30.300 --> 06:32.100
Really, I'm worried sick.

06:34.033 --> 06:38.967
Also, half a dozen sour pickles
and two prune Danish.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.934
I want the lox to visit,
not set up shop there.

06:43.433 --> 06:45.800
Ma, this is serious surgery.

06:46.533 --> 06:48.133
Surgery is the easy part.

06:48.200 --> 06:52.100
-Who's going to take care of you after?
-I don't know.

06:52.166 --> 06:54.500
Think about it.
You're alone. No one likes you.

06:59.967 --> 07:02.333
-Be nice, ma.
-You'll come here.

07:02.400 --> 07:03.934
Not that nice, ma.

07:04.533 --> 07:06.033
Dorothy, he's still family.

07:06.100 --> 07:09.934
It's your fault he's family,
but let's not dwell on that.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.667
The yutz could die.

07:12.166 --> 07:13.633
Sophia's got a point.

07:14.233 --> 07:17.700
-What am I going to do?
-Ma's right. You'll recover here.

07:17.767 --> 07:20.734
You can have my room
till you're better.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.467
You're the greatest.

07:23.934 --> 07:24.934
I don't know what to say.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.266
Are your ears clogged, too?
Let me start again.

07:29.166 --> 07:33.633
Half a pound of lox, a dozen bagels,
two prune Danish, six sour pickles,

07:33.700 --> 07:35.166
and a container of cream cheese.

07:40.367 --> 07:41.633
(knock on door)

07:41.967 --> 07:43.033
Come in.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.166
Well, tomorrow's the big day.
Are you excited?

07:47.667 --> 07:48.700
Rose...

07:52.200 --> 07:55.000
he's having a bypass,
not going off to college.

07:56.734 --> 07:58.166
You'll be just fine.

07:58.233 --> 08:02.367
-I brought you some clean towels.
-Babe, you're a remarkable woman.

08:02.433 --> 08:04.900
I said towels, Stanley, not a kidney.

08:06.400 --> 08:09.867
-She's trying hard to be brave.
-She's very convincing.

08:10.433 --> 08:13.000
Have a wonderful night, Stan.

08:13.066 --> 08:16.233
We wanted to wish you luck
in case we don't see you again.

08:19.667 --> 08:20.867
Before you leave...

08:21.233 --> 08:24.100
for the hospital,
not another world. I...

08:25.734 --> 08:28.867
Let's not bother him.
Let Stan rest in peace.

08:31.667 --> 08:33.066
Oh. Sorry.

08:35.633 --> 08:39.233
I'm going to pack your bag tonight.
We have to leave at 7:30 tomorrow,

08:39.300 --> 08:40.900
so you can be admitted by 8.

08:41.533 --> 08:42.667
-Dorothy?
-Yeah?

08:43.800 --> 08:45.734
I really appreciate
everything you're doing.

08:45.800 --> 08:46.800
I know.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.233
I've never been this scared.

08:49.300 --> 08:52.834
You said yourself it's
a very common operation.

08:52.900 --> 08:56.467
-Still, something could go wrong.
-There's always a chance.

08:56.934 --> 08:59.800
When there's a chance with me,
it usually does.

09:00.834 --> 09:01.967
The way I figure it...

09:02.967 --> 09:04.700
I'm going to die, Dorothy.

09:05.800 --> 09:09.467
-You're not going to die.
-Yes, I am. I'm going to die.

09:10.100 --> 09:13.100
There are things I have to say to you.

09:14.467 --> 09:15.467
I love you, Dorothy.

09:15.867 --> 09:17.734
It's crazy coming from a guy

09:17.800 --> 09:20.166
who walked out after 38 years,
but it's true.

09:20.233 --> 09:22.700
I've already forgiven you for that.

09:23.033 --> 09:27.266
Besides, it's not so terrible
to wait 38 years

09:27.333 --> 09:29.133
to make your first big mistake.

09:30.900 --> 09:32.400
It wasn't my first mistake.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
What?

09:34.367 --> 09:37.133
Remember the chain-link fence
retailers convention

09:37.200 --> 09:38.767
in Atlantic City in 1957?

09:38.834 --> 09:42.200
Oh, God.
You had an affair at the convention.

09:42.266 --> 09:45.467
There was no convention.
I just had an affair.

09:45.533 --> 09:48.367
-Oh, Stanley!
-She didn't mean a thing to me.

09:48.433 --> 09:51.500
She was a waitress in a Greek diner.

09:51.567 --> 09:56.667
She'd put rolls on the table
and say, "Can I butter your buns, Stan?"

09:58.133 --> 10:01.100
One morning, she said it,
and there were no rolls on the table.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.500
Next thing I knew,
we were in Atlantic City.

10:05.567 --> 10:09.967
It was just that one time. Forgive me.

10:10.033 --> 10:13.700
Forgive you. I'm sitting at home
with two screaming kids,

10:13.767 --> 10:16.834
praying you'll sell enough chain link
to put food on the table,

10:16.900 --> 10:19.633
and you're planting your
flag on Mount Olympus.

10:21.867 --> 10:23.734
You make it sound so cheap.

10:24.567 --> 10:26.166
Tell me you understand.

10:26.233 --> 10:31.033
-Forgive me before they cut open my heart.
-They may have to stand in line.

10:32.333 --> 10:35.467
-Dorothy, please!
-Oh, all right.

10:35.533 --> 10:37.867
All right. You're off the hook, Stanley.

10:38.734 --> 10:42.133
Go to the hospital with a clean
conscience. I forgive you.

10:42.433 --> 10:45.266
You've got the compassion of a priest...

10:45.834 --> 10:48.233
but you'd have to be
the Vatican softball team

10:48.300 --> 10:49.767
to forgive me for the other time.

10:52.633 --> 10:54.500
The other time?

10:55.066 --> 10:56.533
I didn't mean it to happen.

10:56.600 --> 10:59.800
I was in the bar in that Greek diner.

11:00.066 --> 11:01.533
A woman sat next to me.

11:01.600 --> 11:04.166
We talked, drank, broke dishes.

11:04.734 --> 11:08.700
I came to in a motel
with my toupee in my mouth.

11:10.533 --> 11:14.200
I cannot believe I am hearing this.

11:14.266 --> 11:16.667
I always assumed
something like this could happen.

11:16.734 --> 11:19.667
I figured it would be with that
blonde secretary

11:19.734 --> 11:21.667
who couldn't type or take shorthand.

11:22.233 --> 11:23.900
You're wrong on two counts.

11:24.367 --> 11:27.700
She could take shorthand,
and we did have an affair.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.133
I am shocked.

11:32.667 --> 11:35.266
That airhead could take shorthand?

11:39.100 --> 11:43.066
Tomorrow I'm checking into the hospital.
I may never come out.

11:43.133 --> 11:49.633
I want you to know, despite everything,
I've never loved anyone as much as you.

11:49.700 --> 11:50.867
I know that, Stan.

11:52.033 --> 11:53.233
Then you forgive me?

11:53.800 --> 11:54.934
I forgive you.

11:55.433 --> 11:56.767
I feel so much better.

11:57.433 --> 11:59.967
And that makes me
feel so much better.

12:17.166 --> 12:19.100
Ma, where were you?
We've been worried.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.900
Rachel Devito's in this hospital.

12:21.967 --> 12:24.633
She slipped in the shower,
broke her hip...

12:25.000 --> 12:28.200
fell through the shower doors,
hit her head against the sink...

12:28.500 --> 12:30.700
got a concussion
and swallowed her dentures.

12:33.767 --> 12:36.266
To hear her complain,
no one else has problems.

12:37.767 --> 12:41.467
-I took some cookies. You hungry?
-No. I'm too upset to eat.

12:41.533 --> 12:43.133
They're doing everything they can.

12:43.200 --> 12:47.133
-I know. I'm sorry. I'm just scared.
-Understandable.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.066
No, it's surprising.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.600
When I was married to Stan,

12:51.667 --> 12:53.800
there were moments
when I'd look at my life and think,

12:53.867 --> 12:56.300
"oh, my God, what if I lost him?"

12:56.800 --> 13:00.166
Guess you can't turn your back
on 38 years of living

13:00.233 --> 13:04.834
because part of me feels that way
right now. I didn't expect it.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.934
I thought the next I went through this,
it'd be for ma.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.667
Maybe I can fall and break my hip
so you won't have to return.

13:13.233 --> 13:16.633
It's strange.
If anything happened to Stan,

13:16.700 --> 13:20.367
I would feel like his widow.
I know I'm not, but...

13:21.033 --> 13:24.867
we've been through so much,
that's how I'd feel.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.033
I remember the first time
anybody called me a widow.

13:28.333 --> 13:32.433
I was terribly lonely and depressed,
just missing George something awful.

13:32.500 --> 13:37.133
My best friend Rebecca Sue Bliss
persuaded me to join her for a night out.

13:37.200 --> 13:40.934
We no sooner stepped into
the boots and saddle grill,

13:41.000 --> 13:44.433
than these two brawny truckers came over
and offered us a drink.

13:45.333 --> 13:48.667
Then one of the truckers
noticed my wedding band.

13:48.734 --> 13:51.100
I was so stunned, I couldn't speak.

13:51.166 --> 13:54.567
Becky sue spoke, saying, "She's a widow."

13:54.633 --> 13:57.400
-You poor baby.
-I know.

13:57.900 --> 14:01.433
The next time I decided to party
when George was out of town on business,

14:01.500 --> 14:03.166
I left that wedding ring home.

14:05.767 --> 14:09.867
-You were unfaithful to George?
-Of course not.

14:09.934 --> 14:12.266
I was flirting. Nothing wrong with that.

14:12.333 --> 14:15.266
Keeps you healthy, keeps you in shape,
keeps your buttocks firm.

14:17.834 --> 14:20.834
And I wasted all that time on jazzercise.

14:22.433 --> 14:25.433
I hate being called a widow.

14:25.734 --> 14:29.900
It sounds permanent and final.
I don't believe it is.

14:30.467 --> 14:33.467
Someday Charlie and I
are gonna be together again.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.066
Probably not in the old house.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.834
We don't need much room.
The kids are grown and we'll be dead.

14:45.367 --> 14:47.767
-Excuse me, Mrs. Zbornak?
-Yes.

14:47.834 --> 14:49.133
I'm Dr. Steven Deutsch.

14:49.200 --> 14:52.667
Mr. Zbornak's out of surgery,
and he's doing fine.

14:52.734 --> 14:54.066
Oh, thank God.

14:54.133 --> 14:57.834
He's in recovery and should be out
of intensive care within 48 hours.

14:57.900 --> 14:59.600
Oh, ma.

14:59.667 --> 15:02.300
I understand he'll be spending
his recovery period with you.

15:02.367 --> 15:05.633
-That's right, doctor.
-Well, it's a critical time for him.

15:05.700 --> 15:08.967
With proper care, there's no reason
he won't be good as new

15:09.033 --> 15:11.533
-within three months.
-Did you say three months?

15:12.667 --> 15:15.200
Ma, he said three months.

15:28.967 --> 15:31.100
You call that wrestling?

15:31.600 --> 15:34.433
If you can't take a crotch slam,
get out of the business.

15:36.367 --> 15:39.100
This is great.
You and me watching television.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.867
There's a great basketball game on 7.

15:41.934 --> 15:45.133
It's ok to leave your room,
but not to talk.

15:46.433 --> 15:50.166
I'm an expert in basketball.
It's one interesting thing about me.

15:50.233 --> 15:52.700
You've lived here two months.
There's nothing interesting about you.

15:53.900 --> 15:56.567
I mean it. Ask me anything.

15:56.934 --> 15:59.200
When the hell are you leaving?

16:01.767 --> 16:03.834
-You kill me.
-Love to.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.066
-Oh, hello there, Stanley.
-Hi, guys.

16:09.133 --> 16:14.033
You wait here, honey. You'll never guess
what this wonderful fool did.

16:14.100 --> 16:18.734
He bought a fire-engine red convertible.
Put it on his credit card.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.266
I'll get a wrap.

16:20.734 --> 16:25.467
Hey, dude, so you won out.
I figured you would.

16:25.533 --> 16:28.533
I overheard Blanche telling the others

16:28.600 --> 16:31.100
that you got the brains, charm
and sex appeal,

16:31.166 --> 16:34.600
while your twin brother, Rob the slob,
batted a big fat zero.

16:35.066 --> 16:36.934
Ok, Rob, I'm ready. Let's go.

16:40.467 --> 16:41.500
You're Rob?

16:42.333 --> 16:43.333
Bye, Blanche.

16:43.767 --> 16:46.533
-Why? Wh-- what's wrong?
-Ask him.

16:48.667 --> 16:49.667
Stan?

16:50.000 --> 16:53.300
I thought Rob was Bob.
I said something I shouldn't have.

16:53.867 --> 16:55.800
Stan, I'm going to kill you.

16:55.867 --> 16:59.867
Stan, I'm going to kill you.
Do you know what this is?

16:59.934 --> 17:04.934
-It's a plate I dropped.
-This is not just a plate.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.934
It's a family heirloom.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.333
It's great-great-grandma Nylund's
ceremonial wedding plate.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.433
Wedding plate?

17:11.500 --> 17:15.000
The bride's family fills the plate
with fruit.

17:15.066 --> 17:17.166
At the wedding, the guests eat from it.

17:17.233 --> 17:21.700
Then the bride and groom
leave to start their wedding night...

17:21.967 --> 17:25.100
which takes place in a tent
or a best western.

17:27.967 --> 17:29.166
A best western?

17:29.233 --> 17:32.500
The Vikings have always been a very
progressive people.

17:33.734 --> 17:36.533
Anyway, that's when it's time
for the husband

17:36.600 --> 17:41.400
to symbolically offer himself
to his new bride on the plate.

17:44.500 --> 17:48.500
Yecch! I ate a tuna sandwich
on that plate this afternoon.

17:50.934 --> 17:53.533
I'll never forgive you.

17:53.600 --> 17:57.133
My niece is getting married in the spring.
What's her husband going to do?

17:57.200 --> 18:00.467
I'll bet a gravy boat
would work in a pinch.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.133
I tried three different stores,

18:06.200 --> 18:09.333
but I found what you wanted
to help you sleep.

18:09.400 --> 18:13.066
Wow, strawberry quik.
You are the best, babe.

18:13.667 --> 18:18.567
I'm going to take a shower.
Could you bring me a mug of that stuff?

18:19.567 --> 18:24.100
-Dorothy, that man is driving me crazy.
-We have to get him to leave.

18:24.166 --> 18:29.000
I know how difficult Stanley is.
I lived with him for 38 years.

18:29.066 --> 18:33.033
He's recovering from major surgery.
He needs us.

18:34.133 --> 18:36.667
-He's taking advantage of you.
-He is sick.

18:37.233 --> 18:41.433
He has to decide
when he's ready to leave.

18:41.500 --> 18:44.700
Well, sometimes people need help
making decisions.

18:45.467 --> 18:47.200
That's the way it was with Thor.

18:47.767 --> 18:48.900
Our pet lamb.

18:49.567 --> 18:52.166
From when he was first separated
from his mother,

18:52.233 --> 18:55.734
he wouldn't eat, sleep, or frolic
with the other sheep.

18:56.834 --> 18:59.500
You're slipping into verse, Rose.
Keep it simple.

19:01.266 --> 19:05.734
Daddy got the idea of taking
this old inner tube, wrapping it in wool,

19:05.800 --> 19:08.066
and putting it next to Thor's bed.

19:08.600 --> 19:12.333
We named it Brunhilda,
and it did the trick.

19:12.633 --> 19:16.734
Thor thought it was his mother.
He began eating, sleeping...

19:16.800 --> 19:17.867
-Frolicking.
-Frolicking.

19:17.934 --> 19:19.000
Yes.

19:20.266 --> 19:22.667
Then one day,
Thor got a little playful

19:22.734 --> 19:25.266
and accidentally bit Brunhilda.

19:26.333 --> 19:30.967
The poor little guy stood there watching
his mother deflate before his very eyes.

19:32.533 --> 19:34.200
He was never the same.

19:34.934 --> 19:39.467
Sure, once in a while he'd baa...
at the back tires of a parked car.

19:40.934 --> 19:45.200
-For the most part, he kept to himself.
-I see your point.

19:45.266 --> 19:46.467
-You do?
-Who cares?

19:46.533 --> 19:47.934
You want to hear the sequel?

19:49.700 --> 19:54.500
The point is, Stan's getting too
comfortable here. He may never leave.

19:54.567 --> 19:56.900
-She's right.
-She is not.

19:56.967 --> 19:59.500
He is recuperating.
He is not getting comfortable.

19:59.567 --> 20:02.533
He doesn't want to stay here.

20:03.567 --> 20:06.333
-Stan, you're wearing my robe.
-Tell me about it.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.400
Which one of Stan's angels
forgot my dry cleaning?

20:09.700 --> 20:11.433
Oh, wow. Cheesecake.

20:12.066 --> 20:13.400
Mmm.

20:15.367 --> 20:18.100
I just love it when we all get together
like this.

20:24.900 --> 20:31.533
Strange, you getting a relapse the very
day the doctor says you're ready to leave.

20:31.600 --> 20:36.100
-Well, the heart's a funny organ.
-I bet most of your organs get a laugh.

20:38.667 --> 20:42.066
-Blanche, I sense some hostility.
-Good, because I hate you.

20:44.500 --> 20:45.834
She's just a little edgy

20:45.900 --> 20:48.166
because we've taken care
of you for two months,

20:48.233 --> 20:51.600
and you've made life
generally unbearable.

20:51.667 --> 20:55.333
That's not very charitable.
What's for lunch?

20:56.066 --> 20:58.867
We've been more than charitable.

20:58.934 --> 21:02.734
In the village of my ancestors,
if a man was bad company,

21:02.800 --> 21:07.166
unable to provide for his family,
and no fun under the yak skin...

21:07.233 --> 21:09.333
the women left him in the snow to die.

21:12.500 --> 21:13.567
Tough village.

21:14.400 --> 21:17.867
Dr. Deutsch says there's nothing
to worry about.

21:18.467 --> 21:21.667
Some patients do experience
a sudden setback like this

21:21.734 --> 21:24.000
just when their recovery
seems to be complete.

21:24.066 --> 21:25.867
Boy, what rotten luck.

21:25.934 --> 21:30.834
I guess I was pushing myself too hard,
trying to do too many things.

21:31.633 --> 21:34.667
Could you hand me the remote control
from the top of the television.

21:34.734 --> 21:37.400
You get some sleep.

21:37.467 --> 21:40.400
Maybe you're right.
Wake me for lunch, ok, babe?

21:47.166 --> 21:50.233
<i>...15 on the clock</i>
<i>and Davis brings the ball to midcourt.</i>

21:50.300 --> 21:52.567
<i>He's making a move.</i>

21:52.633 --> 21:54.834
<i>He's driving. It's up, it's good!</i>

21:56.600 --> 21:58.233
You feeling better, magic?

21:59.800 --> 22:01.800
Dorothy... Dorothy, I...

22:02.300 --> 22:03.500
I know this sounds insane...

22:03.900 --> 22:08.667
but I thought a little activity
would help me snap this setback.

22:08.734 --> 22:12.467
I was wrong. I should just rest.

22:12.533 --> 22:14.200
Help me into bed.

22:14.266 --> 22:18.567
Stanley, how could you fake a relapse?
Do I deserve this?

22:18.867 --> 22:23.600
I took care of you.
I defended you to my friends.

22:23.667 --> 22:26.333
I mean, why did you do this?

22:26.400 --> 22:29.934
I'm scared, Dorothy...
scared of being alone.

22:30.700 --> 22:33.500
This whole experience
has made me feel so vulnerable...

22:33.567 --> 22:34.734
so mortal.

22:35.300 --> 22:38.567
Being here with you
makes me feel secure.

22:39.066 --> 22:42.734
Sure, it's great having somebody
cook your meals, clean your room,

22:42.800 --> 22:47.567
do your laundry, entertain you,
but that's not why I wanted to stay.

22:47.633 --> 22:49.133
It's just a bonus.

22:49.667 --> 22:53.500
I wanted to stay because I'm happiest
with the people I love.

22:54.533 --> 22:55.800
Oh, Stanley.

22:56.867 --> 23:00.200
Stanley, you know, in all the years
that we've been together...

23:01.467 --> 23:04.333
I don't think you ever
opened up to me this way...

23:04.867 --> 23:07.200
and poured out such crap.

23:11.100 --> 23:12.567
Didn't buy any of it, huh?

23:13.166 --> 23:15.633
Not true. I believe you're scared.

23:16.066 --> 23:19.600
You've just discovered something
most of us have known for years...

23:20.300 --> 23:23.200
life doesn't always turn out your way.

23:24.233 --> 23:26.066
I found that out when you divorced me.

23:26.533 --> 23:31.333
I was scared and alone... but I survived.

23:32.266 --> 23:35.667
And now you will, too...
'cause you have to.

23:36.734 --> 23:38.433
Does this mean you're throwing me out?

23:38.500 --> 23:41.900
No, I'm pushing you out of the nest.

23:42.500 --> 23:45.000
You can't run here
whenever you have a problem.

23:45.066 --> 23:48.333
I'm not your mother.
I'm not even your wife anymore.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.667
Stanley, it's time that you grew up.

23:53.233 --> 23:55.200
Happy birthday, Peter Pan.

24:08.934 --> 24:15.734
(theme music playing)
