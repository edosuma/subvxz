17:06.200 --> 17:07.500

you're not perfect.

17:07.532 --> 17:09.200
Yes, I think you did that.

17:09.233 --> 17:11.500
Yes, but I still love you
and I care about you.

17:11.532 --> 17:15.032
- You don't treat people
you love like that.

17:15.066 --> 17:16.400
You don't scream at people

17:16.433 --> 17:18.532
and let them go to bed in tears
if you love them.

17:18.567 --> 17:20.532
- She's gonna make herself
the victim.

17:20.567 --> 17:23.233
She's gonna turn it all around.
Everyone else is wrong.

17:23.266 --> 17:26.099
She freaks out, she bolts,
and can't face people.

17:26.133 --> 17:28.567
For some reason
when you confront Lisa

17:28.600 --> 17:30.667
about things she just bolts.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.333
- You know what,
I'm not dealing with this.

17:32.367 --> 17:34.033
- Well, why are you
walking away?

17:34.066 --> 17:36.100
- We're having a conversation.

17:36.133 --> 17:38.166
- This is a ----ing
sabotage attack.

17:38.200 --> 17:40.400
- Listen--
- Thank you very much.

17:40.433 --> 17:43.400
- I'm going. Bye, guys.
- Please do not leave, Lisa.

17:43.433 --> 17:46.300
- That's what she does,
and I don't want her to leave.

17:46.333 --> 17:49.100
I want her to come back.
I want to figure it out.

17:49.133 --> 17:50.500
- They should believe me
and if they don't

17:50.533 --> 17:53.300
then I don't really want them
to be part of my life.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.166
It's as simple as that.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.133
- There has to be some
conversation, some dialogue.

17:57.166 --> 17:58.433
- There has to be.

17:58.467 --> 18:00.166
- Because, even if she
tells me,

18:00.200 --> 18:02.066
"Eff off, I never want
to be friends with you,"

18:02.100 --> 18:04.133
and I haven't done
anything wrong to her.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.467
- She just makes it so hard.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.533
- Since the Radar Online
article's come out,

18:08.567 --> 18:11.567
I have not heard
or seen Lisa at all.

18:11.600 --> 18:14.200
- I don't want to be have this
be taking energy from my life.

18:14.233 --> 18:16.367
- Kyle and Lisa have had
an argument,

18:16.400 --> 18:19.266
but what did I do to Lisa
to be cut out?

18:19.300 --> 18:21.600
- Those women still love you.
- It's a shame.

18:21.633 --> 18:23.500
- It is a shame.
- It's a shame, but cheers--

and you're missed.

- Not really but thank you.

18:27.333 --> 18:29.600
I don't get it.
How do you not talk it out?

18:29.633 --> 18:32.467
Don't throw away
a 10- or 20-year friendship.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.100
We're going on an RV trip.

18:34.133 --> 18:36.233
It would be a lot of fun
to have you there.

18:36.266 --> 18:37.600
- Thank you but no.

18:37.633 --> 18:39.133
Even if she said,

18:39.166 --> 18:42.233
"We're going shopping
with George Clooney in Paris,"

18:42.266 --> 18:45.367
and these women I wouldn't go.
But on an RV trip?

18:45.400 --> 18:47.266
Uh, I'll pass.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.166
I don't want you to feel
you have to defend me.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.400
- I'm not defending you.
- Why not?

18:51.433 --> 18:54.133
What kind of ----ing
friend are you?

18:54.166 --> 18:55.367
- I have to go pee.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.133
- Okay, well why
don't we go inside.

18:57.166 --> 18:59.567
- There's lots of trees.
- He's never done that.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.166
I don't want to encourage that,
Kyle.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.400
- I don't know.
I don't have sons.

19:02.433 --> 19:05.100
I hear they go on trees.
- I know. I know.

19:05.133 --> 19:07.266
Jaggy, come with me, please.

19:07.300 --> 19:09.500
Oh lordy.

19:09.533 --> 19:12.500
- Jaggy.
[sighs]

19:12.533 --> 19:16.233

like to mark their territory.

Around me.

19:17.667 --> 19:19.367

of the water,

Uh-oh.

he's peeing in the pool.

19:23.367 --> 19:25.533
- No, Cruz. No.
- He's going.

19:25.567 --> 19:27.533
- This is one thing
you don't need to learn

19:27.567 --> 19:29.233
from your brother.

19:29.266 --> 19:30.567
- Coming up...

19:30.600 --> 19:32.333
- I'm disappointed she didn't
show up at the shower.

19:32.367 --> 19:34.133
- Why didn't you tell her,
"Yes, you were invited"?

19:34.166 --> 19:35.667
- Oh, I said
I didn't know that.

19:35.700 --> 19:37.533
- But you did.
- No, you're right about that.

you're coming back?

19:47.333 --> 19:49.000
- Whatever time
the concert ends.

19:49.033 --> 19:50.734
- I like my mashed potatoes.

19:50.767 --> 19:52.533
- You like your
mashed potatoes?

19:52.567 --> 19:55.266
- Uh-uh.

a glass of champagne?

20:19.633 --> 20:21.000
- Yeah.
- Sure!

- I just poured one.
- Okay, well if you are.

20:24.400 --> 20:27.367
- One, two, three...

we've added more shows

20:29.533 --> 20:31.467
and I have a few hours back
in Los Angeles

20:31.500 --> 20:33.734

of a better way to spend them

20:33.767 --> 20:35.700

- You see the bull?

20:45.367 --> 20:46.600
- Yes.

20:46.633 --> 20:48.433

a mechanical bull

20:48.467 --> 20:50.367

funeral with my cousins

20:50.400 --> 20:51.734

at her funeral?

bar with my cousins after it.

"By the way,
yes you were invited."

24:50.166 --> 24:52.200

It's okay though.

24:52.233 --> 24:53.767

you weren't invited.

Of course I would
have wanted you there."

Oh, I said I didn't know that.
I'm sorry.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.066

25:02.100 --> 25:04.567
- What happened to Vanderpump?
She's not here.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.266

- Of course I invited her.

25:06.300 --> 25:08.100
Yeah.

- Thank you.

41:05.133 --> 41:08.233
- Dorit and I don't have
the best friendship,

41:08.266 --> 41:10.500
but I'm gonna side with Dorit
on this one.

41:10.533 --> 41:12.100
- 30 seconds
without jumping in.

41:12.133 --> 41:14.500
- Go ahead.
- Teddi and her big mouth.

41:14.533 --> 41:16.000
Know-it-all Teddi.

41:16.033 --> 41:19.133
It's not the right time
to insert herself

41:19.166 --> 41:22.767
into that conversation. Period.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.300
- I'm sorry, my whole fight
has been about

41:25.333 --> 41:28.066
protecting the two of you.
- No.

41:28.100 --> 41:30.767
Your fight has been about
your own personal experiences

41:31.000 --> 41:32.266
and things--
- No, you're wrong.

41:32.300 --> 41:34.100
Dorit you're 100% wrong.
- Kyle, I understand--

41:34.133 --> 41:35.700
- If it was about Lisa and me
and I didn't know

41:35.734 --> 41:37.300
the two of you,
I would have defended her

41:37.333 --> 41:39.166
blindly like she wants me too.

41:39.200 --> 41:41.033
But because I care
about the two of you I couldn't

41:41.066 --> 41:45.033
----ing do that.
I had to ----ing be honest.

41:45.066 --> 41:47.333
- It's strange to watch

41:47.367 --> 41:50.000
Dorit and Kyle both wanting
Lisa's friendship

41:50.033 --> 41:52.000
and who's going to be
better friends with her.

41:52.033 --> 41:55.133
It's beyond.
The whole thing is beyond.

41:55.166 --> 41:58.033
- Why would he say that to me?
- It was a joke.

41:58.066 --> 42:00.266
- If that's a joke,
his humor sucks.

42:00.300 --> 42:01.734
- Well, I beg to differ.

42:01.767 --> 42:03.300
- I didn't see you
laughing about that.

42:03.333 --> 42:05.000
- Honey.

42:05.033 --> 42:07.033
- I think he actually thinks
he's being funny,

42:07.066 --> 42:08.266
but he's not.
- I agree.

42:08.300 --> 42:10.000
- Just like Vanderpump
thinks she's funny.

42:10.033 --> 42:11.567
- I don't want--
- Here's the thing--

42:11.600 --> 42:13.533
- So maybe you shouldn't be
friends with British people.

42:13.567 --> 42:15.100
- [laughs] Oh, my God.

42:15.133 --> 42:19.767
- I'm so sick of,
"It's British humor, darling."

42:20.000 --> 42:22.300
That was my own British humor,
but I'm not British.

42:22.333 --> 42:25.100
I wish I could hide
behind British humor.

42:25.133 --> 42:29.100
No, I'm just an asshole
with iconic hair and big lips.

42:29.133 --> 42:30.767
- You guys, we got to go.
- Do you have an opinion

42:31.000 --> 42:33.033
that you want to share
because I did shut down Teddi

42:33.066 --> 42:34.700
because I wanted
to have a conversation.

42:34.734 --> 42:37.033
- I just wish that every time
that we had an issue

42:37.066 --> 42:39.100
you didn't have to snap at me
when I'm just sharing my--

42:39.133 --> 42:41.133
- Teddi, you didn't have
to jump in immediately.

42:41.166 --> 42:42.734
- But then say that,
in that tone.

42:42.767 --> 42:45.400
You don't have to "ahh!"
It's always that.

42:45.433 --> 42:47.000
♪ ♪

42:47.033 --> 42:49.700
- You snapped. You did.
- Maybe it's because I'm really

42:49.734 --> 42:51.266
sick and tired of her
doing it to me.

42:51.300 --> 42:53.100
- Well.

42:53.133 --> 42:54.667
- Just constantly chiming

42:54.700 --> 42:56.734
in and having
a little go at me or having--

42:56.767 --> 42:58.233
- I'm not trying to have
a go at you.

42:58.266 --> 43:00.367
- I'm sorry if I was
a little aggressive.

43:00.400 --> 43:01.667
- Good.
- Because I really--

43:01.700 --> 43:03.033
- Good.
- Didn't mean it to be.

43:03.066 --> 43:04.600
- Okay.
- That's it.

43:04.633 --> 43:06.400
And I came down to set
the record straight with her.

43:06.433 --> 43:08.400
- I know.
- That comment just,

43:08.433 --> 43:10.300
it hurt her.

43:10.333 --> 43:13.200
- I know PK's a good guy.
I was offended in the moment,

43:13.233 --> 43:15.166
but I'm not going
to carry a grudge.

43:15.200 --> 43:17.033
- Why don't we all go home?
- Yes.

43:17.066 --> 43:19.033
- Bye.
- Bye, love.

43:19.066 --> 43:20.767
- Am I going to hold on
to this forever? No.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.300
- Bye, girls. Get home safe.

43:22.333 --> 43:25.734
- But right now I'm pissed off.
(BLEEP) you, PK.

43:25.767 --> 43:28.233
Oh, and that's British humor.

43:28.266 --> 43:30.633
- Next on "The Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills"...

43:30.667 --> 43:32.700
- Sophia's coming home.
We're taking her holiday--

43:32.734 --> 43:34.200
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

43:34.233 --> 43:36.100
- The gate open?
- Honey, run!

43:36.133 --> 43:37.233
- God damn it.

43:37.266 --> 43:39.333
- So Dorit came over
to explain things

43:39.367 --> 43:41.133
and then Teddi just jumped in.

43:41.166 --> 43:43.133
I just feel like she's a bit
of a know-it-all.

43:43.166 --> 43:45.233
- I know you think
you're better friends with Lisa

43:45.266 --> 43:46.667
than PK is with Lisa.

43:46.700 --> 43:51.066
- I never even heard of you
or PK until two years ago.

43:51.100 --> 43:53.667
- Cool. LVP. We're going
to have lunch together.

43:53.700 --> 43:55.266
- It's very difficult for me
to believe

43:55.300 --> 43:57.166
that you had
nothing to do with that.

43:57.200 --> 44:00.100
- If you believe I gave
the story to Radar Online,

44:00.133 --> 44:02.233
we don't have a friendship.

44:02.266 --> 44:04.166
