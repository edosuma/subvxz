WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:04.005
- Previously on Gotham...
- Where's Jeremiah?

00:05.381 --> 00:06.508
(gasping)

00:08.760 --> 00:10.261
BRUCE: Selina,
she's not herself, Alfred.

00:10.428 --> 00:11.763
She's desperate for revenge.

00:12.263 --> 00:15.058
You can't save her from herself.

00:15.975 --> 00:17.393
NYGMA: This <i>time,</i>
woke up on a rooftop.

00:17.810 --> 00:19.229
No idea how I got there
or what happened

00:19.395 --> 00:20.772
<i>during the preceding hours.</i>

00:21.856 --> 00:23.942
<i>GORDON: In Haven,
as long as we survive,</i>

00:24.150 --> 00:26.027
hope survives in Gotham.

00:29.989 --> 00:32.200
<i>You've been promising me
help for weeks.</i>

00:32.575 --> 00:34.744
<i>WALKER: I'm working
on getting you help.</i>

00:35.578 --> 00:36.829
GORDON:
I promise I won't stop

00:36.996 --> 00:39.123
until I find those responsible.

00:40.833 --> 00:43.294
I've got a lead
on a guy selling RPGs.

00:43.586 --> 00:45.380
Oh, oh, please don't hurt me.

00:45.547 --> 00:48.216
I just want to know
what you saw.

00:48.383 --> 00:50.593
You had some kind of a rocket.

00:51.427 --> 00:54.347
And you shot it
at that building.

01:01.854 --> 01:03.147
(film projector clicking)

01:03.314 --> 01:04.857
Raise your hands, Mr. Gordon.

01:05.692 --> 01:07.860
I'm sorry, Steve,
they made me do it.

01:09.070 --> 01:10.363
All right, be quiet, you.

01:10.655 --> 01:12.031
Miss Zant, we're sorry
to interrupt your breakfast,

01:12.198 --> 01:13.992
but you'll come with us,
quickly.

01:14.284 --> 01:16.202
You may lower your hands now,
Mr. Gordon.

01:16.744 --> 01:17.787
Turn around.

01:23.209 --> 01:24.711
There a problem, Officer?

01:24.877 --> 01:27.505
We know you sold the RPG
that took out Haven.

01:28.423 --> 01:29.132
So?

01:29.299 --> 01:31.009
So I want to know
who bought it.

01:31.342 --> 01:34.804
Or what? You gonna arrest me?

01:35.513 --> 01:37.307
Who said anything
about arresting you?

01:38.141 --> 01:39.350
I want a name.

01:40.852 --> 01:41.686
What do you say, boys?

01:41.853 --> 01:43.396
(guns cocking)

01:43.563 --> 01:48.234
Should we show this lawman how
we feel about uninvited guests?

01:56.743 --> 02:01.331
Now, who told you
I sold that RPG?

02:14.385 --> 02:15.720
(grunting)

02:22.310 --> 02:23.227
(gunshon

02:40.953 --> 02:42.121
Eduardo?

02:42.664 --> 02:44.332
Nice shot, right?

02:46.876 --> 02:48.461
SOLDIER:
Lower your weapon now.

02:48.628 --> 02:49.337
EDUARDO:
Delta Force,

02:49.504 --> 02:50.755
stand down.

02:52.465 --> 02:53.341
What are you doing here?

02:53.508 --> 02:56.052
Come on.
The last time I saw you,

02:56.219 --> 02:57.303
you were running
through sniper fire,

02:57.470 --> 02:59.639
plucking my sorry ass
from a burning truck.

03:00.556 --> 03:01.933
Least I could do
was pay you back.

03:02.767 --> 03:04.435
I had that guy
right where I wanted him.

03:07.230 --> 03:08.314
I'm glad you're here.

03:10.066 --> 03:11.317
Yeah, me, too.

03:11.526 --> 03:13.403
<i>IS'</i>

03:18.074 --> 03:19.534
We hated each other in boot.

03:19.742 --> 03:21.786
Jim disapproved
of my ops tempo.

03:22.286 --> 03:25.123
(chuckles): Yeah, 'cause you
only had one speed: too fast.

03:25.289 --> 03:26.749
Took me a while to
realize he wasn't afraid

03:26.916 --> 03:28.668
to get his hands dirty.
Just being careful.

03:28.918 --> 03:30.712
- Yeah.
- Well, Jim's taught me a thing or two

03:30.878 --> 03:32.380
- about being careful.
- (laughs softly)

03:33.089 --> 03:34.215
So what's the mission plan?

03:34.507 --> 03:37.802
Well, we are the help
Secretary Walker promised.

03:37.969 --> 03:40.680
Our goal is to make this
hellhole safe again.

03:40.847 --> 03:42.932
So it took the murder of
hundreds of innocent civilians

03:43.099 --> 03:43.975
to get the government to act?

03:44.142 --> 03:46.060
We're here to eliminate
all criminal threats.

03:46.227 --> 03:48.521
We're gonna blanket the city
with flash sweeps.

03:48.688 --> 03:50.148
Well, what about the people
that are still trapped here?

03:50.314 --> 03:52.024
- They need relief now.
- Hey, I'm with you,

03:52.191 --> 03:53.276
but my mandate's clear:

03:53.443 --> 03:57.071
first we restore order,
then we take the next steps.

03:58.197 --> 03:58.906
ANGEL:
Sir.

04:00.616 --> 04:01.367
We got something, sir.

04:01.534 --> 04:02.869
Captain Gordon,
this is my second,

04:03.035 --> 04:04.245
Sergeant Angel Vallelunga.

04:04.412 --> 04:05.246
Captain.

04:06.914 --> 04:07.999
<i>Ledger.</i>

04:08.791 --> 04:11.419
Our arms dealer kept track
of his buyers.

04:15.131 --> 04:16.382
"Edward Nygma.

04:16.798 --> 04:17.800
Two RPG."

04:18.468 --> 04:19.469
NYQma.

04:19.844 --> 04:21.345
Yeah, that name's on my list.

04:21.846 --> 04:22.972
Think he's our bomber?

04:23.139 --> 04:24.265
Only one way to find out.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.476
All right,
you and I will get Nygma.

04:27.393 --> 04:28.686
Harvey, I need you to set up

04:28.853 --> 04:30.646
a command center
with the soldiers at GCPD.

04:31.022 --> 04:32.148
- I'll grab some guys.
- Yeah.

04:32.607 --> 04:33.983
Hey, look, hey, Jim.

04:34.567 --> 04:36.027
I'm not as fast
as I used to be,

04:36.194 --> 04:37.403
but I still got
some fight in me.

04:37.612 --> 04:39.697
I'm not a desk jockey.
I'm a street guy.

04:40.239 --> 04:42.200
What you are is the best cop
that I know.

04:43.618 --> 04:45.661
We're going after Nygma.
He's ten steps ahead.

04:45.828 --> 04:47.872
This thing goes sideways,
you're gonna have to take over.

04:49.290 --> 04:50.500
I need your help, buddy.

04:53.085 --> 04:53.836
I got it.

04:58.174 --> 04:58.966
(door closes)

05:02.762 --> 05:03.846
Alfred.

05:04.889 --> 05:06.307
Oh, there you are, Master Bruce.

05:06.682 --> 05:09.101
There's been a break
in the Haven bombing.

05:09.268 --> 05:10.269
Seems that Gordon and Bullock

05:10.436 --> 05:12.063
have got a rather
strong lead, apparently.

05:14.816 --> 05:15.858
What's the matter with you?

05:16.025 --> 05:17.276
I can't find Selina.

05:17.610 --> 05:18.736
I've looked all over
the Green Zone.

05:20.154 --> 05:21.906
Somehow, I think Miss Kyle
is perfectly capable

05:22.073 --> 05:23.866
of looking after herself,
Master Bruce.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.701
Except that she's not herself.

05:26.285 --> 05:27.995
You saw what she
did to Jeremiah.

05:29.413 --> 05:30.748
Yes. I did.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.335
Listen, come here.

05:37.713 --> 05:40.174
Jeremiah Valeska
deserved to die.

05:41.175 --> 05:44.095
Jeremiah made Selina a murderer.

05:45.346 --> 05:46.848
Just like Ra's made me
a murderer.

05:47.014 --> 05:47.807
Ra's goaded you

05:47.974 --> 05:49.684
into stabbing him, Master Bruce.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.478
He used you as an instrument.
You're no murderer.

05:53.396 --> 05:54.730
But Selina is.

05:55.398 --> 05:56.607
You're not the same.

05:57.692 --> 05:58.860
She did what she did
with open eyes,

05:59.026 --> 06:01.070
and you got to learn
to respect that, son.

06:01.863 --> 06:03.531
You're wrong about her, Alfred.

06:04.949 --> 06:06.200
And I'm gonna
go find her.

06:08.995 --> 06:09.912
(exhales)

06:10.830 --> 06:12.790
(sirens wailing,
birds squawking)

06:13.916 --> 06:15.585
NYGMA:
It's Monday, <i>5:32</i> p.m.

06:15.751 --> 06:17.753
(over recorder): I'm standing
in a dumpster. My head hurts.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.213
(fast-forwards)

06:19.505 --> 06:23.384
it's happened again.
It's... Saturday, 12:16 a.m.

06:23.926 --> 06:25.386
My fingernails are full of dirt.

06:25.553 --> 06:26.846
Have I been digging?

06:27.013 --> 06:28.639
(fast-forwards)

06:28.764 --> 06:30.808
I think it's Sunday.
I can't find my watch.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.561
And it's dark outside,
my feet are wet.

06:33.728 --> 06:34.770
There's mud everywhere.

06:34.937 --> 06:35.688
God!

06:36.606 --> 06:39.150
It doesn't make sense!

06:42.194 --> 06:44.530
You're not a murderer, Ed.

06:46.616 --> 06:48.284
Except Kristen Kringle.

06:49.535 --> 06:50.870
And Officer Dougherty.

06:52.204 --> 06:56.459
But all those people...
and children.

06:57.376 --> 06:58.544
How could you do it?

06:58.878 --> 07:00.171
Why?!

07:01.130 --> 07:03.299
(panting)

07:03.466 --> 07:04.842
It doesn't matter why.

07:05.885 --> 07:06.969
What matters

07:07.929 --> 07:11.349
is that it was you
who killed them.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.768
Not me.

07:14.769 --> 07:15.645
(exhales)

07:16.312 --> 07:16.979
(door thuds)

07:20.441 --> 07:23.069
Edward Nygma, you're under
arrest for the attack at Haven

07:23.235 --> 07:24.987
and the murder of hundreds
of innocent people.

07:25.154 --> 07:25.905
No.

07:26.697 --> 07:28.532
No, Jim, I can explain.

07:29.408 --> 07:30.409
Explain?

07:32.036 --> 07:33.496
You son of a bitch.
You actually did it?

07:33.663 --> 07:36.040
- On your knees, now.
- No! I didn't.

07:36.958 --> 07:37.959
I can prove
it, I just,

07:38.125 --> 07:41.045
I need".l need
a little bit of time.

07:41.629 --> 07:42.546
Say the word, Jim.

07:43.214 --> 07:44.215
You know me, Jim.

07:45.049 --> 07:46.425
The people
that I...

07:46.926 --> 07:50.304
have hurt, they hurt me first.

07:50.471 --> 07:52.765
I didn't know
a single person in Haven.

07:53.265 --> 07:54.558
I'm innocent.

07:57.186 --> 07:58.354
It's your call, buddy.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.357
He basically confessed.

08:07.196 --> 08:08.364
We bring him in.

08:08.781 --> 08:09.949
He stands trial.

08:10.700 --> 08:11.909
Yeah, I don't think so.

08:13.536 --> 08:16.664
(steady beeping)

08:16.914 --> 08:19.375
Your friend is standing
on a pressure-plated lED

08:19.542 --> 08:21.002
One of several
throughout the rooms.

08:23.295 --> 08:27.216
Twitch, and you'll repaint
the room with your organs.

08:34.849 --> 08:36.225
Don't do it, Jim.

08:37.143 --> 08:40.688
This little doohickey
monitors my heartbeat.

08:40.938 --> 08:44.650
It increases by ten? Boom.

08:44.984 --> 08:46.569
Decreases by ten?

08:46.986 --> 08:47.695
Boom.

08:47.862 --> 08:48.988
<i>GORDON: You try to
walk out of here,</i>

08:49.155 --> 08:51.365
and a special forces sniper
will put a bullet in your head.

08:51.532 --> 08:52.241
No, they won't.

08:52.450 --> 08:55.077
This thing can detonate his bomb
from a mile away.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.497
Or am I bluffing?

08:59.081 --> 09:01.542
Once word gets out that
you're responsible for Haven,

09:02.209 --> 09:03.461
you'll have a target
on your back.

09:03.627 --> 09:05.254
I'll take my chances.

09:07.840 --> 09:08.716
(whispers):
I think he's bluffing.

09:08.883 --> 09:09.759
No, no.

09:09.967 --> 09:10.926
He doesn't bluff.

09:12.803 --> 09:13.804
I don't want anyone here

09:13.929 --> 09:15.389
- if this thing detonates.
- You heard the man.

09:15.556 --> 09:17.266
Tell Sergeant Vallelunga
to stand down.

09:17.475 --> 09:19.268
- Yes, sir.
- Nygma walks.

09:21.771 --> 09:23.773
A wristband that monitors
his heart rate.

09:24.065 --> 09:25.191
Welcome to Gotham.

09:26.150 --> 09:27.359
So what we do?

09:28.069 --> 09:30.946
Well, the way I see it,
now we're all tied up.

09:31.113 --> 09:32.823
I just got to save your life
one more time,

09:33.199 --> 09:34.325
then I'm back in the lead.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.244
Funny. Seriously,
the hell are we gonna do?

09:37.661 --> 09:41.540
Well, he pulled a book
to set the booby trap.

09:44.210 --> 09:45.753
I think I can make it.

09:46.712 --> 09:49.673
Assuming the vibrations don't
trigger the IED, what then?

09:50.341 --> 09:51.133
Then we just got to figure out

09:51.300 --> 09:52.760
what sort of puzzle
he wants us to solve.

09:53.135 --> 09:54.011
Puzzle?

09:54.303 --> 09:57.389
There's always a puzzle
with Nygma. You ready?

10:12.655 --> 10:15.491

10:52.319 --> 10:53.863
I'm gonna wring

Jim, you nab Nygma?

11:57.384 --> 11:58.928
No. Put the word out:

11:59.345 --> 12:02.181

CROWD (chanting):
The freak is dead!

12:22.534 --> 12:24.203
The freak is dead!

12:24.370 --> 12:27.122
The freak is dead!
The freak is dead!

12:29.083 --> 12:30.251
MAN (over radio):
Citizens of Gotham,

12:30.417 --> 12:32.836
this is a special bulletin
from the police department.

12:33.045 --> 12:34.672
We have identified
the person who fired

12:34.838 --> 12:37.633
a rocket-propelled grenade
that decimated Haven.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.094
Be on the lookout
for a tall, skinny man

12:40.594 --> 12:43.347
who goes by the name
of Ed Nygma.

12:43.514 --> 12:46.183
He was last seen wearing
a green suit and eyeglasses.

12:49.186 --> 12:52.022
Ed Nygma.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.816
The monster of Haven.

12:53.983 --> 12:55.150
- Let's go get him!
- ALL: Yeah!

12:55.317 --> 12:56.860
- Let's kill him!
- (cheering)

12:57.027 --> 12:58.070
Kill him!

12:58.237 --> 12:59.989
ALL (chanting):
Kill him! Kill him!

13:00.155 --> 13:02.866
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

13:08.998 --> 13:10.249
ExceHenL

13:16.463 --> 13:20.217
200 bullets, as promised.
Go have fun.

13:20.634 --> 13:21.677
And there's more
where that came from

13:21.844 --> 13:23.178
if you keep up the good work.

13:23.554 --> 13:24.847
Off you go.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.475
Mr. Cobblepot, sir.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.478
- It's...
- What? What?

13:33.397 --> 13:34.940
"Edward Nygma
is the monster res...

13:37.901 --> 13:40.821
responsible for killing
the innocents at Haven."

13:46.410 --> 13:48.120
(strained):
Ed, what have you done?

13:48.537 --> 13:50.622
I saw him go that way!
He's over there!

13:50.789 --> 13:52.249
Get him! Come on!

13:52.374 --> 13:54.084
(overlapping shouting)

14:05.888 --> 14:06.847
ANGEL (over radio):
Bang Zero-One.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.432
This is Bird Zero-Two.

14:09.433 --> 14:10.934
What's your status, Angel?

14:11.268 --> 14:12.853
ANGEL:
We cleared 13th to 36th Street,

14:13.020 --> 14:16.023
west of Broadway.
Gonna keep pushing uptown.

14:16.774 --> 14:19.610
That's progress.
Still no Nygma.

14:20.277 --> 14:22.613
My boys will scoop him up
by nightfall.

14:23.864 --> 14:27.534
Now tell me about this...
Scarecrow.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.286
Well, he has
chemical weapons.

14:29.453 --> 14:30.954
Your guys will need gas masks.

14:31.330 --> 14:34.291
But taking him down
would be a big win.

14:34.458 --> 14:36.085
Well, that's why
we're here.

14:45.969 --> 14:48.430
Psst. Hey.

14:55.521 --> 14:58.107
(singsongy):
Time to wake up.

14:58.273 --> 14:59.441
(gasping)

15:02.444 --> 15:03.195
Who are you?

15:03.362 --> 15:06.782
I'm the woman who's gonna
carry out your execution.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.158
(both whooping)

15:13.414 --> 15:14.331
(whooping)

15:21.797 --> 15:24.216
(laughter)

15:27.678 --> 15:29.555
(grunting, gasping)

15:33.475 --> 15:35.144
That's just a taste.

15:35.519 --> 15:39.189
It's only fair you die
slow and painful

15:39.606 --> 15:41.108
to pay for JoJo.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.110
Who's JoJo?

15:43.610 --> 15:46.488
JoJo was in Haven

15:47.156 --> 15:49.992
when you blew it up.

15:51.410 --> 15:54.079
(laughing)

15:57.166 --> 15:58.459
This is a joke, right?

16:00.586 --> 16:02.379
300 people died in Haven.

16:02.754 --> 16:04.339
(scoffs)

16:04.506 --> 16:06.133
We don't care about people.

16:06.341 --> 16:08.302
- MAN: Yeah!
- (laughter)

16:10.596 --> 16:12.431
Look at how happy JoJo was.

16:14.933 --> 16:19.104
(crying): He always had
a smile on his face.

16:20.772 --> 16:23.484
You anthropomorphizing
nincompoop.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.946
Dogs can't smile.

16:31.408 --> 16:34.077

- (whoopifl9)

16:34.912 --> 16:35.704
(shouts)

16:40.876 --> 16:43.712
I'm going to fix you, Ed.

16:48.759 --> 16:49.551
What the hell?

16:49.718 --> 16:52.304
Floor it!

16:55.807 --> 16:58.727
- (whooping)
- Yeah!

17:01.730 --> 17:04.942
(whooping)
Yeah!

17:06.984 --> 17:08.111
Yeah!

17:12.866 --> 17:15.035
I'm going to fix you, Ed.

17:23.544 --> 17:24.670
Did <i>I</i> say stop?

17:24.836 --> 17:25.712
I'm sorry, Ma.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.130
Ma, can't we just
beat him to death?

17:27.756 --> 17:28.799
(engine stalling)

17:31.969 --> 17:33.053
it's not starting.

17:33.220 --> 17:36.014
Yes. Anything but electrocution.

17:36.598 --> 17:38.392
Please don't let
me die this way.

17:38.559 --> 17:41.144
Oh, thank God
the fuel line's clogged.

17:44.815 --> 17:47.067
Unclog the line.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.412
- (laughs)
- We got it, we got it. Come on.

17:58.579 --> 18:01.164
- (laughing)
- Please.

18:02.332 --> 18:04.418
Shoot me, stab me,

18:04.543 --> 18:06.086
anything but another jolt.

18:08.130 --> 18:09.548
Hit it.

18:12.426 --> 18:13.385
Oh, no!

18:13.844 --> 18:15.721
(gasping)

18:16.722 --> 18:18.181
(screaming)

18:21.852 --> 18:22.811
GRETEL:
Put it out!

18:22.978 --> 18:25.230
Boys!
Oh, my Lord!

18:25.439 --> 18:27.441
Help him! Help him!

18:27.608 --> 18:29.526
(yelping)

18:31.612 --> 18:33.488
Who's gonna fix who, Oswald?

18:34.781 --> 18:37.284
HENCHMAN: The Army's invading
the city, locking everyone up.

18:37.659 --> 18:38.577
They're coming this way.

18:38.744 --> 18:43.290
Please. An invasion
is tanks, infantry.

18:43.832 --> 18:44.916
These are scouts.

18:45.834 --> 18:46.501
What about Nygma?

18:46.668 --> 18:48.337
HENCHMAN: Nobody's seen him,
but we got feelers out.

18:48.670 --> 18:52.674
Well, you tell
your "feelers"

18:52.883 --> 18:54.968
that the first man
to bring me Nygma

18:55.135 --> 18:57.179
is the one who
gets to live.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.098
NQW!

19:03.018 --> 19:04.227
(sighs)

19:04.728 --> 19:06.855
flaughs)

19:08.774 --> 19:11.026
lam surrounded
by morons, Edward.

19:11.193 --> 19:12.486
If I didn't have
an empire to run,

19:12.653 --> 19:15.781
I would go get Nygma myself.
(chuckles)

19:28.502 --> 19:29.252
(gasps)

19:29.419 --> 19:33.048
Hello, Oswald. We have
a great deal to talk about.

19:33.382 --> 19:34.549
But first,

19:36.009 --> 19:38.470
did you name your dog after me?

19:42.391 --> 19:44.434
BULLOCK:
Jim, Harper just radioed.

19:44.601 --> 19:46.436
She saw Nygma going
into City Hall.

19:46.603 --> 19:47.896
He's going to Penguin.

19:48.355 --> 19:49.606
EDUARDO: Cobblepot's
at the top of my list

19:49.773 --> 19:51.733
from Walker.
Sounds like a twofer.

19:52.025 --> 19:52.943
GORDON:
Penguin's sitting on all

19:53.110 --> 19:54.319
the ammo in Gotham.

19:54.486 --> 19:56.530
He's better defended,
better manned than anyone else.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.074
We need shock and awe.

19:59.533 --> 20:01.034
Shock and awe is my default.

20:01.827 --> 20:02.744
You ready?

20:05.497 --> 20:07.290
You know what,
take Harvey on this one.

20:07.457 --> 20:08.750
<i>I'll</i> keep things
locked down here.

20:09.209 --> 20:10.293
Let's saddle up.

20:12.838 --> 20:14.798
(rock music playing)

20:17.050 --> 20:19.136
Man, you're killing
my buzz.

20:22.347 --> 20:23.473
Selina.

20:24.433 --> 20:26.810
I know you, and
this isn't you.

20:33.567 --> 20:35.485
- You know me?
- Yes.

20:37.195 --> 20:39.364
Maybe better
than you know yourself.

20:43.493 --> 20:45.203
Let me tell you something.

20:47.831 --> 20:48.915
That night

20:49.332 --> 20:50.917
that your parents were murdered,

20:52.919 --> 20:55.338
I was in that alley

20:55.630 --> 20:57.382
on the fire escape.

20:59.301 --> 21:01.762
And I watched
that guy

21:03.305 --> 21:04.973
shoot your father

21:06.516 --> 21:08.143
and shoot your mother.

21:09.686 --> 21:11.605
And through it all,

21:12.105 --> 21:15.650
I did... nothing.

21:15.817 --> 21:17.486
Flaughs)

21:19.613 --> 21:22.908
I didn't call for help,
I didn't...

21:23.992 --> 21:27.662
(crying): I didn't scream
for the guy to stop.

21:29.706 --> 21:32.334
It wasn't your fault.
You were just a scared kid.

21:34.211 --> 21:35.545
No.

21:38.298 --> 21:41.843
You were the scared kid.

21:46.723 --> 21:49.768
We are not the same, Bruce.

21:53.563 --> 21:56.691
I didn't do anything because
I wasn't willing to risk my neck

21:56.858 --> 21:59.569
for someone else
because I didn't care.

22:02.197 --> 22:05.575
That's who I was
and that's who I am.

22:07.911 --> 22:09.788
("Psycho" by Grim Streaker
Playing)

22:12.833 --> 22:14.167
I love this song.

22:17.754 --> 22:20.757
♪ When I want to go,
I know what you'll say... ♪

22:21.466 --> 22:24.594
What did you do to me, Oswald?

22:25.929 --> 22:27.013
What are you talking about?

22:27.180 --> 22:28.390
Oh, please.

22:29.558 --> 22:31.601
You did something to me.

22:32.561 --> 22:33.228
You...

22:34.813 --> 22:36.648
You are the reason

22:36.815 --> 22:38.441
that I killed those people.

22:39.067 --> 22:40.318
How could you?

22:41.278 --> 22:44.948
You have made me
into some murderous puppet.

22:45.824 --> 22:48.618
For weeks, I've been waking up
in strange places,

22:48.785 --> 22:51.621
not knowing how I got there
or what I did.

22:51.788 --> 22:53.290
Driving myself mad,

22:53.456 --> 22:55.333
thinking I had gone mad.

22:57.335 --> 22:59.588
And now I know
that it was all your doing.

23:01.756 --> 23:02.549
Of everything

23:02.716 --> 23:04.551
that you have put me through,

23:07.262 --> 23:08.388
this...

23:10.098 --> 23:12.142
this is the most cruel.

23:16.563 --> 23:17.314
Ed.

23:18.607 --> 23:21.026
I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:21.818 --> 23:24.946
I did not make
you do anything.

23:25.113 --> 23:27.240
Then what is <i>"I'll</i> fix you"?

23:27.741 --> 23:31.119
What did that mean?
You didn't fix me.

23:31.578 --> 23:32.787
You broke me!

23:33.038 --> 23:34.748
W-W-Wait. No.

23:35.582 --> 23:40.128
I said that to you the night
the bridges blew. I-l...

23:40.462 --> 23:41.796
Think I wouldn't remember?

23:42.255 --> 23:44.132
No, Ed, I saved your life!

23:44.299 --> 23:45.675
That's it!

23:46.676 --> 23:47.844
What are you talking about?

23:49.220 --> 23:52.724
You had been stabbed, I paid
Hugo Strange to save your life.

23:53.892 --> 23:54.976
I bet he did something to you

23:55.143 --> 23:56.728
when he was
patching you up.

23:58.438 --> 24:00.065
You paid Hugo Strange
to save me?

24:01.524 --> 24:02.275
Why?

24:04.736 --> 24:06.738
What was I supposed to do?
Let you die?

24:07.697 --> 24:09.324
After Butch,
you were my only friend.

24:09.491 --> 24:10.617
You shot Butch!

24:10.867 --> 24:13.912
Which is why I needed you!

(shouts)

24:21.795 --> 24:23.046
(exhales)

24:29.928 --> 24:31.054
Edward Nygma,

24:32.305 --> 24:34.015
if I wanted
you to suffer,

24:35.183 --> 24:39.104
I would never do it
in some backhanded way.

24:41.398 --> 24:43.858
If you and I

24:44.275 --> 24:46.987
are ever at
odds again,

24:47.445 --> 24:50.782
you will know, without a doubt,

24:50.949 --> 24:54.786
that I am your enemy.

24:57.205 --> 24:59.416
I promise you that...

25:02.335 --> 25:03.920
(crying):
...as a friend.

25:12.220 --> 25:13.304
(grunts)

25:13.763 --> 25:15.932
(panting)

25:18.560 --> 25:19.686
What a mess.

25:20.228 --> 25:22.355
I might have killed you, Oswald.

25:26.651 --> 25:31.948
And if that day comes...
I swear to you...

25:33.033 --> 25:35.577
...I will stare you in the eye

25:36.411 --> 25:38.621
as I stab you in the heart.

25:40.206 --> 25:41.416
(laughs softly)

25:45.879 --> 25:46.629
(sniffles)

25:46.796 --> 25:48.048
Look on the bright side.

25:48.298 --> 25:50.592
If Hugo Strange did
do something to you,

25:51.551 --> 25:54.512
it means you are not
responsible for Haven.

25:57.182 --> 25:57.849
Where is he?

25:58.016 --> 25:59.976
(rumbling)

26:00.351 --> 26:03.480
Sir, GCPD and the Army
have blown the gates.

26:04.689 --> 26:06.941
Stay here. You'll be safe.

26:07.776 --> 26:10.695
(quietly): Grab Nygma.
They want him, not me.

26:12.906 --> 26:13.948
He's gone.

26:17.577 --> 26:19.954
Idiot! Ugh!

26:23.416 --> 26:24.959
(high-pitched whirring)

26:32.675 --> 26:33.635
(guns cocking)

26:33.802 --> 26:35.386
flaughs)

26:37.013 --> 26:38.973
Why, hello, Harvey.

26:40.308 --> 26:42.894
Now, last time
we were in a standoff,

26:43.061 --> 26:45.563
you ran out of bullets.

26:46.439 --> 26:47.565
Flaughs)

26:48.149 --> 26:50.068
I hope you're better prepared.

26:54.697 --> 26:57.075
We don't want to take
your territory, Oswald.

26:57.700 --> 26:59.285
But you have to put down
your weapons

26:59.452 --> 27:01.037
and hand over Ed Nygma.

27:02.247 --> 27:06.167
Or, if you and your friends
aren't out

27:06.334 --> 27:08.461
by the time I
count to three,

27:08.711 --> 27:11.548
I will mow you all down!

27:14.217 --> 27:15.218
We good?

27:16.010 --> 27:17.011
Yep.

27:19.556 --> 27:20.723
Go ahead. Count.

27:23.726 --> 27:25.520
Flaughs)

27:25.687 --> 27:28.648
Harvey, you're not
thinking clearly.

27:29.524 --> 27:31.276
Maybe call your boss,

27:31.651 --> 27:32.861
see what he thinks.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.196
I don't have
to call anyone.

27:35.780 --> 27:38.616
Go ahead. Count.

27:50.378 --> 27:51.254
One...

27:53.298 --> 27:56.843
(panting)

28:01.264 --> 28:02.932
How's that for better prepared?

28:03.892 --> 28:05.435
Where's Ed Nygma?

28:07.812 --> 28:09.522
The whole of Gotham
is looking for you.

28:09.772 --> 28:11.900
I need information,
your specialty.

28:16.321 --> 28:17.363
I am going to cut

28:17.530 --> 28:20.783
yourface
into a jigsaw puzzle

28:20.950 --> 28:22.744
and watch you try
and put it back together again.

28:22.911 --> 28:25.663
Barbara-- Barbara! Am I dumb?

28:27.332 --> 28:29.667
In all the years of plotting

28:29.834 --> 28:31.294
and the betrayals between us,

28:31.461 --> 28:34.672
have you ever-- ever--
known me to do something

28:34.839 --> 28:36.424
as idiotically brutal
as shoot a rocket

28:36.591 --> 28:38.134
into a building full
of innocent people?

28:39.802 --> 28:42.805
I did not kill
those people in Haven.

28:44.766 --> 28:45.850
Not exactly.

28:47.018 --> 28:48.394
There's more going on here.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.237
I'm waiting.

28:59.489 --> 29:00.657
The night the
bridges fell,

29:00.865 --> 29:04.827
I was hurt. Oswald took me
to Hugo Strange.

29:06.246 --> 29:07.789
And he did something
to my brain.

29:08.039 --> 29:10.541
And that's your excuse for
murdering hundreds of people?

29:10.792 --> 29:14.545
I'm saying that
Strange, or somebody,

29:14.754 --> 29:16.297
can control me.

29:17.340 --> 29:18.883
They killed those people.

29:20.927 --> 29:23.263
Okay, let's say,
by some miracle, I believe you.

29:23.846 --> 29:25.431
Why the hell should I help you?

29:25.598 --> 29:27.475
Because who's working
with Strange?

29:28.601 --> 29:31.437
Who would force me
to kill all of those people?

29:33.398 --> 29:35.316
Information is
your lifeblood.

29:35.942 --> 29:40.822
You help me, and I will give you
the best intel you've ever had.

29:46.411 --> 29:48.037
I don't know where Strange is.

29:48.705 --> 29:50.790
But I can tell you
where you'll find his lgors.

29:50.957 --> 29:51.624
(punch lands)

29:51.791 --> 29:52.792
(grunts)

29:53.126 --> 29:55.336
Where is Edward Nygma?

29:57.088 --> 29:58.673
You're protecting
a mass murderer.

29:59.299 --> 30:00.633
Don't look to me for sympathy.

30:04.304 --> 30:05.513
Fine.

30:06.639 --> 30:08.808
But not with
that meathead around.

30:13.187 --> 30:16.149
Flaughs)

30:16.899 --> 30:20.028
You know, they say you can judge
a man by his friends.

30:20.153 --> 30:22.155
This from a man
who has no friends.

30:27.118 --> 30:27.785
Talk.

30:29.746 --> 30:31.039
NYQmTS a patsy.

30:31.956 --> 30:33.583
He is not a
mass murderer.

30:35.418 --> 30:37.545
Puzzles, games,

30:38.504 --> 30:42.592
perhaps the odd killing here and
there, but hundreds of people?

30:43.134 --> 30:46.054
No. That's not him.
You know this.

30:48.473 --> 30:49.891
So who set him up?

30:50.475 --> 30:52.352
Flaughs)

30:53.478 --> 30:56.356
Jim, you want information,

30:56.522 --> 30:57.940
I want to go home.

30:58.107 --> 30:59.525
Eduardo's not gonna go for that.

30:59.609 --> 31:01.861
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were in charge.

31:06.407 --> 31:08.076
Even if I were
to let you go,

31:08.951 --> 31:11.454
sooner or later,
the Army's gonna come for you.

31:12.413 --> 31:13.831
Things are changing in Gotham.

31:16.876 --> 31:18.336
I'll take my chances.

31:20.338 --> 31:21.381
Now,

31:21.547 --> 31:24.258
do you want Nygma or not?

31:31.182 --> 31:32.767
I know where Nygma's going.

31:41.234 --> 31:43.111
I trust you know
what you're doing.

31:44.153 --> 31:45.738
We do what we have to do, right?

32:01.712 --> 32:02.380
Gentlemen.

32:02.880 --> 32:04.382
Come in. You're late.

32:07.093 --> 32:10.346
The last body you procured
for me was gangrenous.

32:10.805 --> 32:12.807
Completely unsuitable.

32:15.977 --> 32:17.103
Oh,

32:18.187 --> 32:19.147
Bye.

32:20.314 --> 32:21.357
Hello, Professor.

32:23.359 --> 32:24.986
(chuckles)

32:25.153 --> 32:26.070
Mr. Nygma.

32:26.237 --> 32:27.321
Let's skip the part
where you deny

32:27.488 --> 32:28.948
making me into
a killing machine.

32:29.866 --> 32:33.870
Tell me how you took control
of my alter ego.

32:34.871 --> 32:36.080
I don't follow.

32:36.581 --> 32:38.583
You did something
to access

32:38.749 --> 32:40.501
the Ed Nygma side
of my personality.

32:40.710 --> 32:43.421
But... you're Ed Nygma.

32:43.629 --> 32:44.839
I'm also the Riddler!

32:45.047 --> 32:48.092
Tell me what you did!

32:49.677 --> 32:51.679
Why did you make me
kill all those people

32:51.846 --> 32:52.889
in Haven?

32:53.347 --> 32:54.474
You did that?

32:55.016 --> 32:56.225
How interesting.

32:56.851 --> 32:58.186
I had no idea.

32:58.352 --> 32:59.937
You really expect
me to believe that?

33:00.271 --> 33:03.024
Mr. Nygma, I don't know
anything about

33:03.191 --> 33:05.318
your alter egos.

33:05.610 --> 33:07.111
But I will confess that

33:07.445 --> 33:09.655
when I was sewing up
your knife wound,

33:09.822 --> 33:13.493
I may have tinkered a little
with your grey matter.

33:13.659 --> 33:16.162
- Would you just...
- I put a chip in your brain.

33:18.456 --> 33:21.709
It allows you to be able
to be controlled remotely.

33:23.878 --> 33:24.921
I knew it.

33:25.087 --> 33:26.631
But I don't control you.

33:27.006 --> 33:29.050
I gave control to others.

33:29.217 --> 33:30.134
Who?

33:32.637 --> 33:34.222
I will write it down.

33:35.139 --> 33:37.183
That way,
if I'm ever confronted,

33:37.350 --> 33:40.478
I can honestly say
that I never told you.

33:51.948 --> 33:52.949
(sighs)

33:53.115 --> 33:53.950
(thuds)

33:54.742 --> 33:56.118
Not to worry.

33:56.661 --> 34:00.039
You're experiencing a
simple neural cutout.

34:00.122 --> 34:03.209
I am mystified as to
how you've become aware

34:03.376 --> 34:05.378
you're being controlled.

34:06.045 --> 34:10.382
I suppose we're just going
to have to open you up

34:10.841 --> 34:13.969
and take a look under the hood.

34:17.139 --> 34:18.349
Won't we?

34:19.891 --> 34:20.601
Jim.

34:20.768 --> 34:22.436
Sorry, kid, it's just me.

34:27.650 --> 34:28.525
You all right?

34:29.110 --> 34:31.862
Yeah, I'm just, uh,
just looking for Jim.

34:32.029 --> 34:32.947
It's nothing.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.116
I saw soldiers downstairs.

34:36.324 --> 34:38.452
Yeah, the Army's
finally gotten off their asses

34:38.619 --> 34:39.579
and decided to help.

34:39.745 --> 34:41.163
Jim's out
with them now.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.668
Are you sure you're all right?

34:46.377 --> 34:48.379
(distant gunfire)

34:51.882 --> 34:52.967
I don't know.

34:55.428 --> 34:58.097
I see people losing
their will to do good.

34:58.973 --> 35:00.349
People I love.

35:01.601 --> 35:03.060
What if we don't make it
out of this?

35:03.227 --> 35:04.395
I'm not gonna lie, kid.

35:04.604 --> 35:08.482
These past few months,
I've wondered the same thing.

35:10.026 --> 35:10.985
And when I don't know
what to do,

35:11.152 --> 35:13.821
I come up here and I dig into
these case files.

35:14.614 --> 35:16.574
I sit my ass down
and I get to work.

35:17.700 --> 35:19.243
I used to hate this
kind of paperwork;

35:19.410 --> 35:20.995
now it's the only thing
that keeps me going.

35:21.579 --> 35:22.330
Why?

35:22.496 --> 35:24.624
Because the little
things matter.

35:24.790 --> 35:29.503
Act by act, deed by deed,
it means something.

35:30.296 --> 35:31.672
Even if no one notices

35:32.173 --> 35:33.174
OT cares.

35:38.763 --> 35:39.555
Thanks, Harvey.

35:39.805 --> 35:40.973
You're welcome, kid.

35:42.892 --> 35:45.061
If you really want
to do an old man a favor,

35:45.478 --> 35:48.022
you can scrounge me up
a cup ofjoe because I, uh...

35:53.069 --> 35:54.362
Kid's fast.

35:54.695 --> 35:56.739
(drill whirs)

35:56.906 --> 35:59.158
I apologize for the discomfort.

35:59.909 --> 36:03.204
The neural cutout inhibits
muscular function,

36:03.913 --> 36:06.040
but not pain receptors.

36:06.499 --> 36:10.836
A simple reboot of the chip
should be all that is required.

36:11.003 --> 36:13.005
- Although, the sound may be...
- (drill whirring)

36:13.172 --> 36:18.719
...uh, somewhat unpleasant.
Not to mention the smell.

36:23.474 --> 36:25.267
(Edward groaning)

36:30.981 --> 36:32.358
(Edward snorts)

36:35.569 --> 36:36.612
(grunts)

36:58.884 --> 37:01.220
(Edward yips, growls)

37:07.518 --> 37:09.395
(Oswald panting)

37:09.562 --> 37:11.355
(Edward whines)

37:12.106 --> 37:12.857
(sighs)

37:16.318 --> 37:17.611
(inhales sharply)

37:17.820 --> 37:20.573
Edward, I believe
the time has come

37:20.740 --> 37:22.658
for a change of scenery.

37:23.075 --> 37:24.577
(chuckles)

37:25.202 --> 37:28.247
It seems a powerful
electrical charge

37:29.081 --> 37:32.585
overloaded your chip, but I've
gotten everything updated.

37:32.835 --> 37:36.338
I will pass the good news
along to your handler.

37:36.547 --> 37:37.798
(gun cocks)

37:37.965 --> 37:39.300
Care to expand on that?

37:40.259 --> 37:44.597
I was merely helping a man
who needed medical attention.

37:44.930 --> 37:46.348
Yeah, not buying it.

37:49.894 --> 37:50.895
His eyes are open.

37:51.061 --> 37:53.731
I gave him
a biomedical anesthesia.

37:53.898 --> 37:55.983
Wake him up now. Do it.

37:56.150 --> 37:58.319
Oh, very well.

38:00.529 --> 38:02.656
(screams)

38:03.073 --> 38:03.991
Oh!

38:04.158 --> 38:05.951
I told you this wasn't me!

38:06.952 --> 38:08.454
He put a chip
in my brain.

38:08.621 --> 38:10.664
And someone's been controlling
it this whole time.

38:10.873 --> 38:12.291
And then he
drilled in my head!

38:12.666 --> 38:14.001
- Better talk now.
- (Nygma sighs)

38:14.168 --> 38:15.294
lam a scientist.

38:15.461 --> 38:20.007
A contract came along;
I developed a tool.

38:20.299 --> 38:21.008
"A tool"?

38:21.217 --> 38:22.176
How dare you?

38:22.343 --> 38:23.969
A contract from who?

38:28.974 --> 38:31.352
Please escort
the professor out, thank you.

38:33.521 --> 38:34.730
Ta-ta.

38:36.982 --> 38:38.108
What the hell is going on?

38:38.275 --> 38:42.029
Sorry, pal, but this part
of the op is need-to-know.

38:42.446 --> 38:44.365
I couldn't say anything until
we had the suspect in custody,

38:44.532 --> 38:47.451
but Walker wants Ed Nygma
taken out now.

38:49.286 --> 38:50.913
Walker was behind this?

38:51.413 --> 38:53.582
She's been controlling Nygma
the whole time?

38:54.500 --> 38:55.543
(scoffs)

38:55.918 --> 38:57.962
You know I hate this spook crap.

38:58.128 --> 39:00.172
I don't ask questions;
I follow orders.

39:00.339 --> 39:02.132
She's responsible for Haven?

39:03.801 --> 39:04.468
I don't understand, why...

39:04.635 --> 39:07.805
Jim, stop right there, trust me.

39:08.556 --> 39:11.642
Walker wants you
to put a bullet

39:12.309 --> 39:13.394
in his brain.

39:17.314 --> 39:18.232
No.

39:18.732 --> 39:20.276
Call it proof of loyalty.

39:21.235 --> 39:24.071
It's what she needs from you
before she can move forward

39:24.238 --> 39:26.031
with final relief plans.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.243
Hey, come on.

39:29.743 --> 39:30.536
Look at him.

39:31.078 --> 39:31.871
He's a loon.

39:32.288 --> 39:33.539
A cop-killer.

39:35.457 --> 39:37.126
Tell me the truth.

39:37.626 --> 39:39.962
Did Walker destroy Haven?
Did you know?

39:40.129 --> 39:42.715
- Tell me.
- Jim, ours is not to reason why.

39:42.965 --> 39:46.051
And this is your chance
to be a part of this mission.

39:47.094 --> 39:48.053
So...

39:49.805 --> 39:50.764
please.

39:52.391 --> 39:53.642
You pull the
trigger on him,

39:53.934 --> 39:55.436
or I pull the trigger on you.

39:57.771 --> 40:01.567
After all this, you'd kill me
for some bureaucrat?

40:02.985 --> 40:04.612
Mission comes first.

40:04.862 --> 40:05.905
You taught me that.

40:08.949 --> 40:09.867
What's your answer?

40:26.425 --> 40:28.677
Looks like I saved your life
one too many times.

40:32.806 --> 40:34.391
- Maybe so.
- (grunts)

40:34.934 --> 40:35.851
(Eduardo grunts)

40:52.284 --> 40:53.702
You know Jim Gordon.

40:53.869 --> 40:54.912
You know this city.

40:55.204 --> 40:56.038
Find him.

40:56.288 --> 40:57.039
And kill him.

41:08.717 --> 41:11.303
(hammering)

41:16.183 --> 41:18.060
(scraping on stone)

41:22.815 --> 41:23.774
(gasps)

41:27.444 --> 41:29.071
Boss. Wake up.

41:30.489 --> 41:31.615
Wake up.

41:32.032 --> 41:33.283
Ouch.

41:33.867 --> 41:36.495
Oh! Stitches still sore, huh?

41:37.246 --> 41:38.038
Never would
have happened

41:38.205 --> 41:40.332
if you wore that armor
I prepared.

41:41.542 --> 41:44.628
That bullet
is making you sentimental.

41:46.338 --> 41:48.173
Give her a shake, huh?

41:49.925 --> 41:52.511
Hmm. Better?

41:54.805 --> 41:58.142
I told you I had to let
Selina thrust the knife

41:58.308 --> 42:00.686
into my flesh at least once.

42:01.228 --> 42:04.064
Verisimilitude
trumps precaution, you see.

42:04.440 --> 42:05.399
I get it.

42:05.566 --> 42:07.901
Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne
needed to think

42:08.068 --> 42:09.236
you were dead, boss.

42:09.403 --> 42:12.531
Yeah. Right.

42:12.698 --> 42:13.699
(gasps)

42:13.949 --> 42:15.534
I take it you have news?

42:16.160 --> 42:17.745
All systems go.

42:17.911 --> 42:19.747
- Well, then lead the way.
- Oh!

42:34.595 --> 42:35.637
Doctor.

42:36.180 --> 42:37.931
I'm hearing good things.

42:38.265 --> 42:40.017
The bandages are ready
to come off.

42:40.726 --> 42:42.978
Your assistant thought
you'd like to see the results.

42:44.480 --> 42:45.773
Indeed, I would.

43:00.037 --> 43:01.497
Flaughs)

43:04.541 --> 43:08.045
Oh, you two look beautiful.

43:10.506 --> 43:12.216
Oh...

43:13.759 --> 43:18.055
I love family reunions,
don't you?
