00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>September 16th, 1944--</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>Day two of the invasion
on Peleliu.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>They thought it would
be a very short campaign,</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>Maybe over in two
or three days--</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>Only a couple of thousand
Japanese there.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
The only problem was there
were more Japanese there

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Than there were marines
waiting to get ashore.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>We didn't realize
there was a ridge there</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>With over 500 caves in it,</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>All seeing every bit of us
on that island.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>The Japanese
resistance was so fierce</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>That the marines couldn't
get supplies to shore.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
During the day
the temperature rose

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>To 110Â°.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>And no drinkable water
could be found on Peleliu.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>You can go a long time</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>Without food
and survive.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
But you cannot do it
without water.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>I've known thirst
in my life,</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>But I've never known
thirst like that.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>Under these conditions,</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>The marines' orders were to
cross the exposed airfield</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>In the middle of the island.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>When they advanced,
the Japanese opened fire.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>Going across that airfield,</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
That was the longest walk I think I've
ever took in my life right there.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>It was scary as hell.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>I guess what made it
so scary,</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>There wasn't a damn thing
you could do about it.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>I felt helpless,
I felt defenseless.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>I mean, there just wasn't
anything you could do.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
<i>It's a horror show.</i>

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
It's a miracle that
the 1st marine division

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Wasn't completely decimated.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Ho ho ho. I can't believe I
finally get here and you go home.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
What's it like?

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
You could never imagine.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Follow the man in front of you

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
And get off that beach.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Here we go, boys!

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Open fire!
Open fire!

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Keep moving!
Keep moving!

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Sledge, get off the beach.
Let's make a move!

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
- Oh God, bill.
- Oh fuck!

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Bill.
Bill!

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Corpsman.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Corpsman!

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
We're rich, boys.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Jap's got a shitload
of gd in his teeth.

00:00.000 --> 02:43.997
We have to go out
there tomorrow.

03:21.527 --> 03:23.495
Tee, will you see whoever it is
calling so late in the evening?

03:23.630 --> 03:25.897
Yes, ma'am.

03:37.007 --> 03:39.770
It's a man in a uniform, ma'am.

04:00.096 --> 04:02.697
Sidney Philip.

04:02.731 --> 04:05.232
<i>Oh! Father, Sid's here.</i>

04:05.266 --> 04:08.167
- I hope I didn't startle you, Mrs.
Sledge. - Oh, not at all.

04:08.202 --> 04:10.903
Now who the hell is this
standing in my hallway?

04:10.937 --> 04:13.738
- It's Sidney.
- Dr. Sledge.

04:13.772 --> 04:15.540
There's more pie
on the counter.

04:15.574 --> 04:17.342
Thank you, Rose.

04:21.747 --> 04:24.848
I want you to speak
frankly about my Eugene.

04:24.882 --> 04:28.484
- How is he, Sid?
- Now don't put the boy on the spot.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.420
Mrs. Sledge,

04:31.454 --> 04:33.791
Eugene's with a lot
of good marines.

04:33.825 --> 04:36.026
The 1st is the best there is.

04:36.060 --> 04:39.662
They're great guys, too.
They look after each other.

04:39.696 --> 04:42.431
Besides that, well,
he's a mortar man,

04:42.465 --> 04:45.700
The same as me.
Us stovepipe boys,

04:45.735 --> 04:47.769
We're always a little
behind the hot stuff,

04:47.803 --> 04:50.471
Which is a good place
to be, let me tell you.

04:51.839 --> 04:54.140
Now I can't say this
about every marine I know,

04:54.175 --> 04:58.111
But I'm not worried
about Eugene.

04:59.547 --> 05:00.880
See, father?

05:00.915 --> 05:03.549
That's not so hard to hear,

05:03.583 --> 05:05.450
Is it?

05:55.554 --> 05:58.289
<i>Second platoon
corpsman, get up here!</i>

06:17.973 --> 06:21.141
<i>What the hell you doing?</i>

06:21.175 --> 06:24.710
Break this shit down.
Get ready to move.

06:42.294 --> 06:44.428
What do you got?
Any movement?

06:44.463 --> 06:46.030
It's all quiet.

06:47.632 --> 06:49.165
Any word on hoosier?

06:49.200 --> 06:52.500
Well, we got hit
pretty hard on the beach.

06:52.535 --> 06:54.536
We're still sorting out
the casualties.

06:54.570 --> 06:57.805
- Let's go.
- No word on ours, though.

07:03.810 --> 07:07.011
God damn it,
I just want some fucking water.

08:15.421 --> 08:17.221
<i>There's a gook squad
off the the right!</i>

08:17.256 --> 08:18.990
<i>Yeah, they're coming from--</i>

08:19.024 --> 08:21.492
Hey. Hey!

08:22.862 --> 08:26.134
Somebody found water.
I swear to Christ.

08:26.168 --> 08:28.737
- Water.
- Somebody found water.

08:33.412 --> 08:35.815
- Halle-fucking-lujah.
- There's plenty, boys.

08:35.849 --> 08:39.085
<i>All right. Yeah.</i>

08:39.119 --> 08:41.154
<i>Pass my helmet.</i>

08:44.358 --> 08:47.694
Oh, Jesus! Man!

08:48.595 --> 08:50.362
It's poisoned.

08:50.396 --> 08:52.562
Jap fuckers poisoned it.

08:57.165 --> 09:01.201
Listen up, weapons!
C.O.'s got our orders!

09:01.235 --> 09:04.671
All right, here it is.

09:06.073 --> 09:09.078
The entire division's moving
across the airfield at 0900.

09:09.112 --> 09:11.981
First and second
platoon will lead,

09:12.015 --> 09:14.349
Followed by weapons
and third platoon.

09:16.051 --> 09:19.719
<i>The only way to stop this jap artillery
is to get into those hills,</i>

09:19.754 --> 09:23.189
And the only way into those
hills is across this airfield.

09:23.223 --> 09:27.159
<i>When we move, do not stop
until we get across.</i>

09:27.193 --> 09:29.795
<i>You got it?
Aye, skipper.</i>

09:29.829 --> 09:31.763
Any questions?

09:31.798 --> 09:34.233
We need water, Captain.

09:34.267 --> 09:36.368
I'm working on it, corporal.

09:38.237 --> 09:40.106
Get your gear ready
and stand by.

09:40.140 --> 09:42.775
Get back to your positions.
Pack it up!

09:42.810 --> 09:45.846
<i>Let's go, second squad!
Let's get back on line!</i>

09:47.615 --> 09:49.550
<i>Let's go, rockets!</i>

09:49.584 --> 09:52.987
<i>Pack 'em up!
Move it!</i>

10:04.365 --> 10:06.232
We have to cross that?

10:08.435 --> 10:09.734
Quit whining.

10:09.769 --> 10:12.203
It'll all be over
by the time you cross.

10:12.238 --> 10:13.972
Japs hate mortars and bazookas

10:14.006 --> 10:16.077
As much as riflemen, leyden.

10:17.347 --> 10:18.647
How many japs
do you think are up there?

10:21.817 --> 10:25.219
- Anybody got any asswipe?
- No asswipe, no chow,

10:25.253 --> 10:27.387
No water.
So don't even think about it.

10:27.422 --> 10:29.656
A nice cold sip of water?

10:29.691 --> 10:32.192
A little splash on your head?

10:32.226 --> 10:35.361
<i>Put it right out
of your mind.</i>

10:38.730 --> 10:40.497
I've got a little water.

11:30.537 --> 11:32.437
<i>We gotta go!</i>

11:32.471 --> 11:34.971
<i>Stand by!
Look alive!</i>

11:37.140 --> 11:38.541
Thank you.

11:38.575 --> 11:41.511
<i>Let's go!
Get that gear squared away!</i>

11:41.545 --> 11:44.314
You've been promoted.

11:44.348 --> 11:46.750
You're gonna give him
the mortar sight?

11:48.052 --> 11:49.985
It's the least
I can do for the water.

11:54.357 --> 11:56.722
<i>Second squad, on me!</i>

11:58.758 --> 12:00.658
Get off your ass.

12:00.692 --> 12:04.594
Get under that gear.
We're moving shortly.

12:07.698 --> 12:09.765
<i>Stay alert!
Stand by!</i>

12:26.607 --> 12:28.274
Hey, the 5th's dry too.

12:28.308 --> 12:30.741
Maybe the japs have
some over there.

12:34.777 --> 12:37.478
How could they send us up here
without any fucking water?

12:39.478 --> 12:41.010
Lucky?

12:53.861 --> 12:57.163
Get your gear together!
Stand by to move out!

13:33.403 --> 13:35.469
Thank God for the Navy.

13:44.411 --> 13:46.378
First and second platoon,
move out!

13:46.412 --> 13:48.479
<i>Let'!
Let's move! Let's move!</i>

13:50.416 --> 13:52.651
<i>Let's move!</i>

13:52.686 --> 13:54.353
<i>Come on, first squad!
Stay on me!</i>

13:54.388 --> 13:57.356
<i>On me, second squad!
Hurry it up, people!</i>

14:07.767 --> 14:09.535
Left platoon, move out!

14:09.569 --> 14:11.970
<i>Go go go!
Move it! Let's go!</i>

14:12.004 --> 14:13.872
Always first.

14:13.906 --> 14:16.107
<i>- Okay, let's cross the airfield!
- Right behind you, bill.</i>

14:16.141 --> 14:19.710
<i>- Do not stop!
- Move! Stay low!</i>

14:23.416 --> 14:25.217
Weapons, let's go!

14:25.251 --> 14:28.187
<i>First squad,
push dead ahead!</i>

14:28.221 --> 14:31.089
<i>See you on the other side!
Let's go!</i>

14:31.123 --> 14:32.757
Go! Hurry up!
Let's go!

14:32.791 --> 14:35.360
<i>Move it!</i>

15:11.064 --> 15:14.099
Get him out of here!

15:21.742 --> 15:24.711
Reassele at the fallen base!

15:24.745 --> 15:26.880
Come on, sledge! Move!

15:38.130 --> 15:39.965
Let's go.

15:54.788 --> 15:57.491
Listen up!
We're crossing the airfield!

15:57.525 --> 15:59.560
Stand by to move out!

15:59.594 --> 16:02.563
<i>Get ready to cross!
Pass the word!</i>

16:04.432 --> 16:08.202
We're up!
How company!

16:08.236 --> 16:11.071
On the left,
on the right, move out!

16:13.541 --> 16:15.476
- See you on the other side!
- Let's go, marines!

16:15.510 --> 16:18.983
- Let's go!
- Go go go!

16:25.862 --> 16:27.463
<i>Move it!</i>

16:45.554 --> 16:47.154
My knee!

16:57.164 --> 16:59.499
<i>Corpsman, help me!</i>

17:09.375 --> 17:11.609
<i>Stand by to move!</i>

17:11.643 --> 17:14.043
Seibel, move out!
Let's go!

17:14.077 --> 17:16.377
Sonny! J!

17:20.416 --> 17:23.286
Sniper attack!

17:27.459 --> 17:29.494
Let's go!
Move out! Go go!

17:31.397 --> 17:34.065
<i>Move out!
Let's go! Let's go!</i>

18:06.535 --> 18:08.903
Don't stop moving!
Let's go!

18:22.050 --> 18:24.084
You're all right!
Get up!

18:43.436 --> 18:46.472
You've got to get up!
Come on! You're all right!

18:46.506 --> 18:49.774
<i>Move it!
Move it! - Come on!</i>

18:49.809 --> 18:51.376
Hurts like hell!

19:02.619 --> 19:04.787
Are you receiving?

19:04.822 --> 19:06.956
Halfway across the runway, sir.

19:06.990 --> 19:08.591
We're taking heavy fire.

19:08.625 --> 19:11.292
- Runner.
- We need an air strike.

19:11.327 --> 19:13.528
We need--
we need an air strike...

19:13.562 --> 19:15.396
...
To subdue jap artillery

19:15.430 --> 19:17.331
From the hill.

19:17.365 --> 19:19.099
Are you receiving?

19:29.739 --> 19:32.739
- Gotta get some fire on that bastard.
- We're gonna get you some help.

19:34.375 --> 19:36.742
Are you receiving?
Are you receiving?

19:36.777 --> 19:39.710
- I don't think we can send.
- Need a goddamn radio that works.

19:39.745 --> 19:41.579
Fix it. Do you hear me?
Get it done.

19:41.613 --> 19:44.147
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

19:44.181 --> 19:46.314
Leckie.

19:46.349 --> 19:48.849
White castle, this is how-4.
Do you read?

19:48.884 --> 19:51.251
- Gotta go back.
- What about conley?

19:51.285 --> 19:53.019
Get us a radio
and a corpsman up here.

19:53.053 --> 19:55.620
<i>I'll stay with conley.</i>

19:59.089 --> 20:02.824
<i>White castle, this is how-4.
Do you read?</i>

20:02.858 --> 20:06.160
Hey, I'm coming back.
I'm coming back. Do you hear me?

20:07.195 --> 20:09.828
I'm coming back.
I'm coming back.

20:12.664 --> 20:14.431
Come on, stay with me.

20:47.753 --> 20:50.387
Corpsman!
Hey, corpsman!

21:10.003 --> 21:12.204
- Working time is at x-ray-5.
- Corpsman!

21:12.238 --> 21:13.839
White castle, white
castle, do you read?

21:13.874 --> 21:15.842
I need a corpsman and a radio!

21:15.876 --> 21:17.843
A radio?
You're better off

21:17.878 --> 21:19.545
With two tin cans
and a fucking string.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.380
<i>...Plus 100. Over.</i>

21:21.415 --> 21:24.716
<i>- Get me in contact!
White castle--</i>

21:31.390 --> 21:34.558
This is ack ack. Are you receiving?
Drover-king-6...

21:37.193 --> 21:40.194
We need an air strike
on it. Over.

21:41.997 --> 21:44.531
We've gotta get the hell out of here!
Let's go! Let's go!

21:44.565 --> 21:46.432
<i>Let's go! Let's go!</i>

21:46.467 --> 21:49.869
<i>Come on! Let's go!</i>

21:59.614 --> 22:02.715
<i>Get him on his feet!
Keep moving!</i>

22:18.164 --> 22:20.866
- You're okay!
- Come on!

22:20.900 --> 22:22.768
- Come on!
- Let's go!

22:41.224 --> 22:42.891
Oswalt!

23:07.385 --> 23:09.685
<i>Let's go!
Let's go!</i>

23:23.001 --> 23:26.038
Corpsman!
Hey, corpsman!

23:29.144 --> 23:30.679
Corpsman!

23:49.632 --> 23:52.601
Mortars, bomb center
sector and adjust!

23:52.636 --> 23:54.370
Direct fire--

23:54.404 --> 23:57.340
H.E. On the building
on your right front!

24:05.284 --> 24:08.220
Leyden, get that gun
on the right!

24:13.860 --> 24:15.994
- Hanging!
- Fire!

24:17.729 --> 24:20.898
- Hanging!
- Fire two!

24:27.639 --> 24:29.839
Get that one on the left, ay!

24:34.477 --> 24:36.378
Direct fire, 100.

24:36.412 --> 24:38.513
Base charge.

24:44.753 --> 24:47.021
- Hanging.
- Fire!

24:51.628 --> 24:55.266
- 100'! Hit 'em again!
- Four!

24:55.300 --> 24:59.938
- Hanging.
- Fire!

24:59.973 --> 25:02.273
Let's go, k company!
Move out!

25:05.944 --> 25:07.810
Ah!

25:15.119 --> 25:16.886
Spread out!
Keep moving!

25:45.420 --> 25:47.721
<i>Up.</i>

25:50.958 --> 25:52.926
Stop.

25:59.332 --> 26:00.799
Easy.

26:00.833 --> 26:03.034
<i>squad leaders,</i>

26:03.069 --> 26:05.136
Find your people,
check 'em out.

26:05.170 --> 26:08.671
<i>You jasco people,
get set up and wired in.</i>

26:08.705 --> 26:11.507
I need an ammo count.

26:11.541 --> 26:13.976
What do you got?
What do you need?

26:14.010 --> 26:16.611
<i>We'll have o.P.S
going up before dark.</i>

26:16.645 --> 26:20.313
<i>Here you go, guys.
Standby to standby.</i>

26:20.348 --> 26:24.315
<i>That's all we've got. Pass it around.</i>

26:30.752 --> 26:34.153
- Is this item company?
- No, k-3-5.

26:34.187 --> 26:37.655
I've got to get back
to baker-1-7.

26:37.689 --> 26:40.056
Do you have any idea
where they are?

26:40.091 --> 26:43.859
No, I don't. I need you to take
our wounded back to the beach.

26:43.893 --> 26:45.861
No can do.
We're moving out.

27:09.812 --> 27:12.280
Hold here till
we load our wounded,

27:12.314 --> 27:14.349
Then you can move your
ass wherever you want.

27:14.383 --> 27:16.650
Yes, sir.

27:20.921 --> 27:22.987
Get the wounded aboard!

27:24.856 --> 27:27.822
Let's get 'em onboard!

27:31.857 --> 27:35.956
We're fine below!
Lower away!

27:43.163 --> 27:45.029
- Out of the way, sir.
- Where do you want this one?

27:45.064 --> 27:47.165
<i>Right over here.</i>

27:56.470 --> 27:59.202
<i>- Clean this dressing.
- Doctor, his b.p. is falling.</i>

27:59.236 --> 28:01.568
<i>Clamp the bleeder...
Right there.</i>

28:01.602 --> 28:03.468
<i>I've got a
diminished blood pressure.</i>

28:03.503 --> 28:05.835
Sponge.

28:11.538 --> 28:15.371
He's gone. Get him below
and prep that abdominal.

28:51.823 --> 28:53.956
<i>...56,</i>

28:54.857 --> 28:57.357
<i>57,</i>

28:57.392 --> 28:59.660
<i>58,</i>

28:59.694 --> 29:02.495
<i>Set him down here.
Get a tourniquet on that.</i>

29:02.529 --> 29:07.229
...60, 61...

29:07.264 --> 29:10.796
Dextrose. Take one now,
save one for the morning.

29:10.831 --> 29:13.764
<i>...62, 63,</i>

29:14.665 --> 29:16.698
<i>64,</i>

29:18.834 --> 29:20.933
65,

29:22.968 --> 29:24.767
- 66--
- Whatcha doing, Daniels?

29:26.901 --> 29:29.630
- Water.
- Counting japs.

29:31.662 --> 29:33.795
<i>One, two, three...</i>

29:33.829 --> 29:36.728
- What's the report, hillbilly?
- 81 from battalion.

29:36.762 --> 29:38.861
60s are all here
and registered.

29:38.896 --> 29:42.828
Gunny, I need another man
at second platoon l.P.

29:42.862 --> 29:45.228
Roger that.

29:45.262 --> 29:49.158
Hey, Daniels. Second platoon l.
P. Let's go.

29:49.193 --> 29:51.058
<i>I can count
japs from here.</i>

29:51.092 --> 29:53.259
Hey, Daniels, did you ar me?

29:53.294 --> 29:54.827
- I said--
- Gunny. Gunny.

29:54.861 --> 29:57.662
Find someone else for him.
I need Daniels here.

30:01.498 --> 30:03.465
Aye, Skipper.

30:03.500 --> 30:06.701
<i>Doc, Daniels is gonna
come help you count bandages,</i>

30:06.736 --> 30:09.237
- Maybe get a little shut-eye.
- Yes, sir.

30:09.272 --> 30:12.372
Come on, private.
Let someone else take over.

30:12.406 --> 30:14.373
There's so many to count.

30:14.407 --> 30:16.508
I know, private.
I know.

30:19.245 --> 30:21.245
All right, Daniels.

30:29.055 --> 30:31.388
Just as easily been me
counting japs I can't see.

30:32.690 --> 30:35.224
But it's not you.

30:38.829 --> 30:41.564
Sir, coming across
the airfield today...

30:45.068 --> 30:48.171
I've never been more
scared in my entire life.

30:51.042 --> 30:53.076
We're all afraid.

30:53.110 --> 30:55.679
<i>All of us.</i>

30:57.581 --> 31:01.583
A man who isn't scared out
here is either a liar or dead.

31:13.098 --> 31:15.366
History is full of wars

31:15.400 --> 31:17.134
Fought for 100 reasons.

31:17.168 --> 31:21.371
<i>But this war, our war,</i>

31:21.406 --> 31:23.507
I want to believe--

31:25.276 --> 31:27.076
I have to believe

31:27.110 --> 31:29.879
<i>That every step
across that airfield</i>

31:29.913 --> 31:33.417
Every man that's wounded,
every man I lose--

31:35.188 --> 31:38.557
That it's all worthwhile
because our cause is just.

31:41.628 --> 31:45.297
Of course, if a just cause came
with some hot food and cold water,

31:45.331 --> 31:47.532
That'd be okay too.

31:55.810 --> 31:57.912
Rest up, boys.

32:01.386 --> 32:03.723
- Thought you might need that.
- Thank you, sir.

32:12.237 --> 32:15.573
Ack ack got me my battlefield
commission on the canal.

32:18.311 --> 32:21.516
Seems like 1,000 years ago now.

32:23.988 --> 32:27.292
You handled yourself
well today, sledge.

32:28.495 --> 32:30.097
<i>You'll be all right.</i>

32:30.132 --> 32:33.002
Just remember your training.

32:33.037 --> 32:35.105
Yes, sir.

32:48.684 --> 32:50.384
...Order
for the 3rd battalion

32:50.418 --> 32:53.219
To make a company-sized
frontal assault.

32:53.254 --> 32:55.488
G2 thinks the bulk
of the Japanese defenses

32:55.522 --> 32:58.090
Are dug into the ridges that run
up the spine of the valley.

32:58.124 --> 33:00.758
Until we take the high ground,
they'll keep plastering us.

33:00.792 --> 33:02.793
<i>We're moving
into the hills!</i>

33:02.828 --> 33:05.029
<i>Let's move, people!</i>

33:06.499 --> 33:09.768
- Pork chops. - Pork chops?
That's my meat.

33:09.802 --> 33:10.935
Courtesy
of lst-661.

33:10.969 --> 33:13.503
- About time.
- Thank you.

33:13.536 --> 33:15.738
Let's go. Let's go.

33:37.143 --> 33:39.512
Saw you reading last night.

33:41.083 --> 33:42.785
My bible.

33:42.820 --> 33:45.024
Writing too.

33:46.930 --> 33:49.635
Ain't supposed to write
shit down, you know.

33:49.669 --> 33:53.673
It gives the japs valuable
intel if they find it.

33:54.842 --> 33:57.077
I guess I won't show it
to them then.

34:06.156 --> 34:08.424
Got a smoke?

34:26.517 --> 34:28.753
Thanks, sledgehammer.

34:29.689 --> 34:31.290
Sledgehammer.

34:32.593 --> 34:34.093
I like that.

34:34.127 --> 34:36.295
<i>Jesus Christ.
Don't worry.</i>

34:36.330 --> 34:38.297
We've got a nickname
for you too, bill leyden.

34:38.332 --> 34:41.335
We call you
ball-peen hammer--

34:41.369 --> 34:44.571
A little hammer
for a little man.

34:44.606 --> 34:47.708
All right, snafu.

34:47.743 --> 34:50.111
Shit 'n' ass...

34:50.145 --> 34:51.979
Fuck up.

34:52.014 --> 34:56.350
Llittle joke from the little man.

35:02.091 --> 35:04.460
- Gunny, get someone from mortars.
- Aye, skipper.

35:04.494 --> 35:05.995
Burgie,
get me an f.O.

35:06.029 --> 35:08.598
<i>You too, leyden.
Let's go.</i>

35:08.632 --> 35:10.633
- First squad, follow me!
- Hold 'em here, sergeant.

35:10.667 --> 35:12.735
- Set up a security perimeter.
- Aye, sir.

35:12.770 --> 35:14.270
<i>Set up
a security perimeter.</i>

35:14.305 --> 35:16.740
Machine guns move out
to the left and right flank.

35:16.775 --> 35:18.609
Riflemen, faced outwards.

35:18.644 --> 35:20.578
<i>Second squad,
36, let's go.</i>

35:20.613 --> 35:22.881
<i>91 over on the right!</i>

35:55.186 --> 35:58.288
Looks like two heavy
bamboo machine guns,

35:58.322 --> 36:00.557
Probably more.

36:00.591 --> 36:02.291
I need to get a better look.

36:02.325 --> 36:06.361
- Sledge, leyden.
- No no, I'm gonna scout it.

36:06.396 --> 36:08.963
- You sure?
- Yeah.

36:08.998 --> 36:11.866
Get your top ready.

36:59.333 --> 37:01.068
Skipper, pull back!

37:01.102 --> 37:02.871
Stay on those guns!

37:14.394 --> 37:16.162
It's a fortress up there.

37:17.365 --> 37:20.535
We've gotta move!
Pull back!

37:23.875 --> 37:26.443
- Pull back!
- Let's go! Let's go!

37:26.477 --> 37:28.611
Pull back!

37:38.057 --> 37:40.825
<i>- Skipper coming in!
- Hold your fire!</i>

37:42.528 --> 37:45.564
- Radio, get me battalion.
- Yes, sir.

37:45.598 --> 37:47.700
White castle, this is Harper field.
Do you read?

37:47.734 --> 37:50.036
Do you read?

37:50.070 --> 37:53.106
<i>Master white, ack ack.
We've done the recon.</i>

37:53.140 --> 37:55.175
Objective is heavily fortified.

37:55.209 --> 37:57.710
Limited approaches and
plunging fire all the way.

37:57.745 --> 38:01.814
We can't take this objective
without unacceptable casualties.

38:01.849 --> 38:03.749
<i>Do you copy?</i>

38:03.784 --> 38:05.618
Fuck.

38:08.889 --> 38:10.956
I've got to go back
to battalion,

38:10.990 --> 38:13.325
Get these orders changed.

38:13.359 --> 38:15.393
Good luck.

38:15.427 --> 38:18.796
If I don't come back,
the company's yours.

38:34.375 --> 38:36.374
Do you think he'll come back?

38:36.409 --> 38:39.877
You disobey orders,
you get court-martialed.

38:41.313 --> 38:43.079
You guys, check your weapons.

38:43.114 --> 38:45.514
Keep a round chambered.

38:45.549 --> 38:49.481
- Done. - Can you believe
this bullshit about the dog?

38:49.515 --> 38:53.349
Some dog's supposed
to smell a jap before me?

38:53.384 --> 38:55.184
I don't think so.

38:55.219 --> 38:59.521
<i>I appreciate the thought, but ain't no
dog gonna make me sleep safe at night.</i>

38:59.556 --> 39:01.623
I've got a dog.

39:01.657 --> 39:03.325
His name's Deacon.

39:04.360 --> 39:06.661
You keep fucking
that stovepipe.

39:06.695 --> 39:10.031
If the nips come through here at
high port with fixed bayonets,

39:10.065 --> 39:12.333
<i>You nail 'em with flare
and h.E. As fast as you can.</i>

39:12.367 --> 39:15.168
- You think you can do that?
- We've got it, gunny.

39:15.202 --> 39:18.203
I was asking sledgehammer.

39:18.237 --> 39:20.104
Yes, gunny haney.

39:23.141 --> 39:24.541
Woof.

39:31.113 --> 39:32.880
What the fuck was that?

39:32.914 --> 39:36.349
Hey, stovetop boys-- woof!

40:09.811 --> 40:11.679
What's that?

40:11.714 --> 40:13.747
<i>Sounds like some
guy having a nightmare.</i>

40:13.782 --> 40:15.716
<i>He'd better shut up before every
nip on this island knows we're here.</i>

40:15.750 --> 40:18.718
<i>Quiet that man down.</i>

40:18.752 --> 40:21.354
God damn it, shut up.

40:21.388 --> 40:24.456
<i>No! No!
Quiet down!</i>

40:24.490 --> 40:27.825
<i>Hold him down!
Stick him with morphine.</i>

40:27.859 --> 40:29.893
Shut that fucker up.

40:31.496 --> 40:34.665
Stick him with morphine.

40:34.699 --> 40:38.401
<i>Jesus Christ,
who the hell is that?</i>

40:44.573 --> 40:46.804
<i>Hold him down.
Calm down.</i>

40:46.839 --> 40:49.773
Help me, please!
Help me!

40:49.807 --> 40:52.808
That guy is gonna get us all
killed if he don't shut up.

40:52.843 --> 40:55.243
Hold him down.
Hold h.

40:58.580 --> 41:00.680
Hit him with something.

41:04.518 --> 41:07.819
Help me!

41:21.833 --> 41:23.600
All right.

41:24.869 --> 41:26.569
Get back to--

41:28.238 --> 41:30.105
Get back to your holes.

41:47.617 --> 41:49.882
I guess better him
than a of us.

41:51.583 --> 41:53.679
Sledgehammer's right.

41:55.580 --> 41:57.979
It had to be done.

42:04.442 --> 42:08.309
- What you got back there?
- What do you want?

42:08.343 --> 42:10.578
I'll take a cup of Joe.

42:13.982 --> 42:16.616
<i>Hey, peaches,
are you gonna waste those?</i>

42:21.422 --> 42:25.558
- You made it.
- I could say the same about you.

42:28.797 --> 42:31.199
I tried to get you a corpsman.

42:33.639 --> 42:37.342
<i>- I tried to get back to you.
- I know.</i>

42:37.376 --> 42:39.477
Lucky, I know.

43:01.738 --> 43:03.606
You, uh--

43:04.974 --> 43:07.376
You heard any word
about hoosier?

43:12.816 --> 43:15.685
Chuckler's still on that
goddamn piece-of-shit island.

43:18.521 --> 43:21.451
Left a piece of whatever
hit me in my arm.

43:21.485 --> 43:23.683
I guess I'll never have
to buy another drink

43:23.717 --> 43:26.618
In Buffalo ever again.

43:28.554 --> 43:31.289
I'm gonna grab some coffee.
Do you want some?

43:32.191 --> 43:34.688
Can you take me topside?

43:36.222 --> 43:39.117
I need some air.

43:39.152 --> 43:41.482
<i>We've got our orders changed.</i>

43:41.516 --> 43:43.683
<i>Regiment wants us hunting
japs up the East road.</i>

43:43.717 --> 43:46.319
Don't blame yourself.
You did the right thing.

43:47.522 --> 43:49.955
- Good to have you back, sir.
- Thanks.

43:49.989 --> 43:52.822
K company, move out!

44:14.804 --> 44:16.968
Whoever is up there
is getting pounded.

44:17.002 --> 44:20.370
<i>You should start to feel better.</i>

44:20.404 --> 44:23.803
Feel that.
They're starting the engines.

44:28.101 --> 44:29.699
Yeah.

44:30.933 --> 44:32.732
Hey.

44:39.402 --> 44:41.268
Let's go home, Cobber.
