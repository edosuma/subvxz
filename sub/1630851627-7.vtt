Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

01:00.685 --> 01:02.645
This tubing reroutes exotic matter

01:02.729 --> 01:04.522
from this chamber's artificial grav system

01:04.606 --> 01:06.691
-back to the particle accelerator.
-Is there a problem?

01:07.650 --> 01:09.027
Yes, there's a problem.

01:09.110 --> 01:12.614
Our FTL drives won't work
without sufficient exotic matter.

01:12.697 --> 01:15.325
The Salvare's FTL systems
are being decommissioned.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.828
Commander Breckinridge is still out there.
Alive!

01:19.329 --> 01:20.830
This is a death sentence.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.750
The president disagrees, or doesn't care.

01:24.417 --> 01:27.754
And I take my orders from him.
Get back to work.

[Niko] William.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.218
I'm here.

01:34.010 --> 01:35.637
You just have to find me.

01:36.387 --> 01:37.305
No, you're not.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.975
This is just a glitch
in my optical matrices.

Turning the Salvare into a sailboat?

02:25.812 --> 02:27.981
I'm not turning it into anything.

02:28.064 --> 02:31.776
I am just replacing one of the sails.
I've decided to hitch a ride to Earth.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.987
But if you have a better idea, please…

02:34.571 --> 02:36.573
The Polynesians settled the South Pacific

02:36.656 --> 02:38.950
using nothing more
than double-hulled canoes.

02:40.201 --> 02:41.286
But they had wind.

02:42.871 --> 02:46.249
And we have lasers. Photons, actually.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.335
And if we blast enough of them
at the sail,

02:49.419 --> 02:51.129
we'll make our way back
to the colony planet.

02:51.212 --> 02:53.756
Away from our last known coordinates.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.551
We have been sitting here
for a week, Richard.

02:56.634 --> 02:59.888
If Iara could've opened that wormhole
by now, she would have done it.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.723
What if they do tomorrow
and we're not here?

03:01.806 --> 03:05.435
Then they will pick up our distress signal
and they will follow our trail.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.562
Your ship goes down,
you stay where it sank.

03:07.645 --> 03:09.189
The Salvare hasn't sunk!

03:11.274 --> 03:12.650
So we have two choices.

03:13.443 --> 03:18.114
We either sit here and wait for a rescue
that is never gonna come, or we move.

03:18.615 --> 03:21.117
We take control. We save ourselves.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.049
Any beaches on that colony planet?

03:53.775 --> 03:57.320
Call me when you're ready to… hoist this.

It's working.
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

05:48.639 --> 05:52.685
Estimated time to reach colony planet
at projected maximum speed?

05:52.769 --> 05:54.395
[Salvare] Ten days, six hours,

05:54.479 --> 05:56.773
-14 minutes, 40 seconds.
-More than enough oxygen.

05:57.315 --> 06:01.527
Yes… But if I was to recalculate
the ideal angle of the sail,

06:01.611 --> 06:04.447
-I might be able to shave off a few days.
-Niko, stop.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.283
-When's the last time you ate?
-I will grab a protein bar.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.910
No. Something substantial.

you took a break? Slept?

06:12.121 --> 06:13.206
I'm fine.

06:14.457 --> 06:15.291
Are you?

06:18.628 --> 06:20.963
Come on. Let's take a break.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.716
Eat something real.
Something we have to cook.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.259
I'm not that hungry, Richard.

-When's the last time you were there?
-Haven't been back since we left.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.942
Yeah. Since I was 11.

10:10.026 --> 10:10.943
No.

near the border with Mozambique.

We're not even gonna make it back
to that colony planet.

with your bare hands and scrap parts?

[Mackenzie] We've gone through
Niko's status reports.

15:16.832 --> 15:20.044
For the most part, Niko's decisions
indicate more than competent leadership.

15:20.127 --> 15:21.962
Until they encountered a magnetar.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.381
Javier Almanzar, software engineer.

15:24.465 --> 15:27.968
He was left brain-dead as a result
of an unnecessary medical procedure.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.804
Niko was on the Achaian ring
trying to broker a peace deal.

15:30.888 --> 15:34.224
True. But she hardly mentions his injuries
in her mission report.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.477
No one was reprimanded for their actions.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.897
Not Richard Ncube, who was left in charge,
not Dr. Petrossian--

15:39.980 --> 15:41.357
Okay. So this is a cover-up.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.108
We don't know. They're not being honest.

15:43.192 --> 15:46.779
-So what do you want me to do about it?
-You're the husband of their commander.

15:47.529 --> 15:50.908
Oh, you want me to use my wife's memory
as a way to manipulate these people?

15:50.991 --> 15:51.909
No. No way.

15:54.703 --> 15:56.914
Could we just have a moment alone, please?

15:58.040 --> 16:00.042
[radio chatter]

16:01.335 --> 16:03.295
Erik. I get it.

16:03.879 --> 16:06.465
You wanna be loyal to Niko.
You think that we're using you.

16:06.548 --> 16:08.842
Well, truth is we are.

16:09.551 --> 16:13.055
Do you have any actual proof
that these people are withholding intel?

16:13.138 --> 16:15.849
We do know that something happened
around that magnetar.

16:15.933 --> 16:19.061
I haven't seen anything to convince me
we have the complete picture.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.315
Our relationship with the Achaians
is in its infancy.

16:23.899 --> 16:27.403
It could fall apart,
and it will if the crew keeps secrets.

16:28.612 --> 16:31.907
I could get this information
by other means, but I don't want to.

16:42.668 --> 16:43.627
[door opens]

16:43.711 --> 16:45.004
Morning, Cas.

16:45.754 --> 16:48.382
-Erik.
-I'm here to conduct your exit interview.

16:48.882 --> 16:53.637
USIC has a few outstanding questions
that they need to be answered.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.180
-Of course.
-Yeah.

16:55.264 --> 16:56.432
What do you wanna know?

16:56.515 --> 16:58.142
Javier Almanzar.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.813
Why'd he come home brain-dead?
What happened?

17:02.896 --> 17:04.857
You can thank
some guy named Sasha for that.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.734
Him and his Achaian implant.

17:06.817 --> 17:10.487
An implant that Dr. Petrossian
then placed into his head.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.406
Well, he was lost to us either way.

17:12.489 --> 17:15.492
So I, uh… I took a chance.

17:15.576 --> 17:17.745
Right. And it worked.

17:17.828 --> 17:19.872
Yeah. It worked.

17:19.955 --> 17:22.291
Temporarily,
until we transversed that neutron star,

17:22.374 --> 17:23.500
and then it all went to shit.

17:23.584 --> 17:27.504
That's what we wanna know more about.
So, it says in Dr. Petrossian's case files

17:28.338 --> 17:31.508
that Javier's immune system
was actually protecting the implant.

17:31.592 --> 17:32.718
Well, protecting it, sure…

17:32.801 --> 17:35.512
But it was being destroyed faster
than it could be repaired.

17:35.596 --> 17:39.349
So why didn't you guys jump?
Get away from the magnetar? Save his life?

17:39.433 --> 17:40.434
They should have.

17:41.018 --> 17:44.646
But Niko and I were
still on the Achaian ring, so they stayed.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.441
Richard did the best job he could
under the circumstances.

17:47.524 --> 17:48.525
Under the circumstances…

17:48.609 --> 17:51.528
I thought it'd be safer
to remove Javier's implant from his brain.

17:51.612 --> 17:52.488
Why?

17:52.571 --> 17:55.240
Because it was deteriorating.

17:55.324 --> 17:56.617
Why was it deteriorating?

17:58.619 --> 18:01.663
Dr. Petrossian, this is kind of important.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.751
We weren't able to determine anything,

18:05.834 --> 18:08.003
but I didn't want it
disintegrating any further.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.922
I didn't know what damage it'd cause.

18:10.005 --> 18:14.259
So you decided to rip it out of his brain,
causing extensive cerebral trauma,

18:14.343 --> 18:16.095
which led to Javi-err--

18:16.178 --> 18:17.012
Javier.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.138
[Erik] Javier.

18:18.972 --> 18:22.976
Which led to Javier
being brain-dead all over again.

18:23.060 --> 18:26.730
I'm sorry, Cas,
but this doesn't make any sense.

18:26.814 --> 18:29.066
Zayn did what ze thought
was the best decision.

18:29.149 --> 18:31.693
Something happened around that magnetar.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.238
-I'm telling you the truth.
-We're going round in circles.

18:34.321 --> 18:37.783
-I'm just telling you the truth.
-Javier is brain-dead because of Zayn's--

18:37.866 --> 18:40.327
Javier is alive.

18:41.036 --> 18:42.996
Unlike Sasha, Oliver…

18:43.080 --> 18:44.665
And Petra and Michelle…

18:44.748 --> 18:46.125
August, Beauchamp.

18:46.875 --> 18:49.211
All lives lost because of the Achaia.

18:50.003 --> 18:50.838
Cas.

18:55.843 --> 18:59.930
All I'm asking is for you
to complete Niko's mission

19:00.013 --> 19:02.224
by answering a few of our questions.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.478
Please don't let her sacrifice be in vain.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.483
We have all made sacrifices.

19:12.776 --> 19:14.194
May I please be excused?

19:49.813 --> 19:50.856
[groans]

19:52.608 --> 19:53.442
Hey.

19:54.484 --> 19:55.319
Hey.

19:56.445 --> 19:57.905
Why don't you get some sleep?

19:57.988 --> 19:59.781
I will. But, um…

20:00.991 --> 20:06.288
last night was too much wine,
and I spoke out of turn.

20:06.371 --> 20:09.082
No. I asked you what you thought,
and you told me.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.001
In vino veritas.

20:12.544 --> 20:14.671
The last thing I want
is you to censor yourself.

20:15.255 --> 20:16.757
So how did last night go?

20:17.799 --> 20:20.010
No issues. Smooth sailing.

20:20.844 --> 20:24.723
Really? I thought when you stopped by
my quarters that something had gone wrong.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.892
I wasn't near your quarters.

20:27.976 --> 20:29.603
But I saw you outside my door.

20:29.686 --> 20:31.438
And I'm telling you, it wasn't me.

20:32.564 --> 20:33.774
Maybe you dreamt it.

20:34.691 --> 20:36.235
No. I was-- I was awake.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.695
Yeah,
with a bottle and a half of wine in you.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.948
I wasn't the only one drinking last night.

20:41.031 --> 20:42.866
So, what? I was walking in my sleep?

20:42.950 --> 20:45.118
I don't know. Maybe you were, Richard.

20:48.413 --> 20:49.998
That doesn't make any sense.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.209
[Richard] Is there a problem?

20:53.252 --> 20:56.588
Our ETA just jumped from ten days to 23.

20:56.672 --> 20:59.967
-Our oxygen supplies are insufficient.
-How did I fuck that up?

21:00.050 --> 21:03.053
I mean, the sail is intact.
My calculations were airtight.

21:03.720 --> 21:06.181
The only thing
that would make any sense is if the…

21:08.183 --> 21:10.018
laser output is diminished.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.020
Okay. So we just pump them back up.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.939
We don't have the power supply.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.945
-Niko--
-If you're about to say, "I told you so--"

21:20.028 --> 21:21.863
-I can't.
-I'm not. Please. Please.

21:21.947 --> 21:24.658
Just… listen.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.120
We do have enough oxygen.

21:28.745 --> 21:29.579
How?

21:29.663 --> 21:31.832
If there's only one of us breathing.

21:33.125 --> 21:33.959
No.

21:34.459 --> 21:38.213
The fact this tin can's still moving
is entirely because of you.

21:39.089 --> 21:42.134
Niko, you have a family.
A daughter who needs you.

21:43.093 --> 21:46.013
All you have to do is open up an airlock
with me in front of it

21:46.096 --> 21:49.224
and all your problems, solved.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.023
Get off your ass and help me push.

21:57.524 --> 21:58.567
-[grunts]
-Why?

21:58.650 --> 21:59.776
Just grab this end.

22:00.277 --> 22:03.864
-Why?
-Richard, stop wasting oxygen and help me!

22:07.409 --> 22:08.702
-[both groan]
-[metal creaking]

22:11.413 --> 22:13.040
[buzzing and crackling[

22:15.459 --> 22:16.293
Trust me.

22:17.377 --> 22:18.211
I got a plan.

22:22.257 --> 22:25.594
You hit 30, you hire movers.
That's my rule.

22:26.636 --> 22:30.015
No guilting your friends
into helping you move with pizza and beer.

22:30.098 --> 22:31.433
[both laugh]

22:32.267 --> 22:35.354
Oh! What I wouldn't give
for pizza and beer right now.

22:35.437 --> 22:36.521
Oh, yeah.

22:40.525 --> 22:41.610
That should be enough.

22:41.693 --> 22:45.238
And I don't have the energy
to load up this bay for a fourth time.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.450
Open shuttle bay door.

22:49.117 --> 22:50.285
[air whooshing]

22:50.369 --> 22:52.079
[objects clattering]

22:58.460 --> 23:00.253
Well, that got some of the lead out.

23:01.463 --> 23:03.006
What's our current ETA?

23:03.715 --> 23:06.802
[Salvare] 16 days, one hour,
21 minutes, 32 seconds.

23:06.885 --> 23:07.969
Fuck.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.262
But not enough.

23:09.346 --> 23:10.931
That's two days short.

23:12.849 --> 23:14.935
-Anything else we can jettison?
-No.

23:15.018 --> 23:17.479
Not without tearing apart
the walls, floors, and ceilings.

23:17.562 --> 23:20.357
Which we can do and isolate ourselves
to one area of the ship.

23:20.440 --> 23:23.276
No. We'd blow through our oxygen reserves
in the process.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.403
[creaking]

23:25.237 --> 23:26.405
Go get some sleep.

23:27.656 --> 23:29.282
Richard, that is an order.

23:29.366 --> 23:32.494
Or what?
I mean, you gonna throw me in the brig?

23:33.078 --> 23:34.329
Make me walk the plank?

23:35.539 --> 23:39.751
Tearing apart this ship
is our last resort. Okay?

23:40.669 --> 23:42.087
Just go get some sleep.

23:42.170 --> 23:45.090
I will have a better plan
by the time you wake up.

23:46.466 --> 23:48.468
[creaking]

23:49.469 --> 23:50.303
Go.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.508

25:48.547 --> 25:50.423
-[sighs]
-[door opens]

25:50.507 --> 25:52.008
Sorry to keep you waiting.

25:52.634 --> 25:53.760
[door closes]

25:54.344 --> 25:55.470
You ever hit Vegas, Zayn?

25:57.556 --> 25:59.349
I'm not much of a gambler.

25:59.432 --> 26:02.018
I'm sorry. What am I doing back here?

26:02.102 --> 26:03.979
When I go to Vegas, I like to play poker.

26:04.062 --> 26:07.315
See, when you play long enough,
you start to be able to read people.

26:07.399 --> 26:10.026
Everybody has a tell.
Your tell? Your hands.

26:11.361 --> 26:14.614
When you lie,
you start to gesture after you speak

26:14.698 --> 26:16.950
because your brain
is running in overdrive.

26:17.033 --> 26:19.494
It's wondering,
"Is this person buying what I'm sellin'?"

26:20.161 --> 26:22.581
Look, I've answered all your questions,
multiple times.

26:23.164 --> 26:25.083
I've told you everything I know.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.752
Now, my mother is very sick.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.589
So I'd like to be released
so I could be with her.

26:30.672 --> 26:32.757
Your mother is more than just sick.

26:35.635 --> 26:37.762
It looks like
she has a day or two at most.

26:45.312 --> 26:47.522
[breathing shakily]

26:48.231 --> 26:49.190
What is this?

26:56.865 --> 26:58.617
-Is this a threat?
-The exact opposite.

26:58.700 --> 27:02.829
This is a gift,
because the Achaians can save her life.

27:02.912 --> 27:05.457
And they will, if you just tell me
what the crew is hiding.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.425
[bleeping]

27:15.508 --> 27:18.094
[whispers] We could just
increase the ship's albedo.

27:19.012 --> 27:20.472
[clattering]

27:24.434 --> 27:25.268
Richard?

27:29.272 --> 27:30.690
[beeping]

27:30.774 --> 27:33.652
[whispers] Maybe I should explore
the collection area.

28:37.674 --> 28:39.050

28:39.759 --> 28:41.261
There's something on the ship.

28:41.344 --> 28:42.762
[sighs] Niko.

28:43.847 --> 28:47.809
Are you saying you knocked these over,
and what? Crushed them for fun?

28:49.227 --> 28:52.605
There's something on the ship,
and we need to find it

28:54.232 --> 28:55.233
and deal with it.

29:24.220 --> 29:25.680
[clattering]

32:30.490 --> 32:31.616
It's an Achaian.

32:32.408 --> 32:33.660
It's one of them.

32:36.329 --> 32:38.247
[loud crunching and rustling]

32:40.792 --> 32:42.001
[Richard sighs]

32:42.877 --> 32:43.753
Shit.

32:44.253 --> 32:45.588
Let's get outta here.

32:47.173 --> 32:49.175
[rustling]

32:54.555 --> 32:56.724
[Niko] Those fucking things
did not fall on their own.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.268
We checked every square inch
of the Salvare.

32:59.352 --> 33:02.522
-None of our sensors picked up anything.
-The Achaia are energy beings.

33:02.605 --> 33:05.692
So far, the Achaia are a piece of plastic
flapping in a crawl space.

33:05.775 --> 33:06.943
I didn't imagine this.

33:07.026 --> 33:09.612
It's normal. It's good.
It's how a soldier keeps on fighting,

33:09.696 --> 33:11.656
-keeps on living.
-I didn't make this up!

33:11.739 --> 33:13.282
Maybe you did, and you're not aware.

33:13.366 --> 33:16.411
Or maybe you're trying to drive me
over the edge so I'll give up like you,

33:16.494 --> 33:18.705
and we can take
the coward's way out together!

33:21.624 --> 33:23.376
I saw the pills in your room.

33:31.968 --> 33:34.053
I haven't given up. [breathes shakily]

33:35.430 --> 33:37.765
I just don't have any fight left in me.

33:40.435 --> 33:42.228
-Richard--
-I'm tired, Niko.

33:44.605 --> 33:46.024
Way before this mission.

33:48.985 --> 33:50.611
I can't do it anymore.

33:57.660 --> 33:59.579
There is something on this ship.

34:01.789 --> 34:05.501
So I need you to take those feelings
and bury them.

34:06.836 --> 34:08.713
I need you to fight with me.

34:08.796 --> 34:10.089
[alarm blares]

34:10.173 --> 34:12.717
[Salvare] Warning.
Damage to external sail.

34:13.301 --> 34:14.427
Pull up visual.

34:15.011 --> 34:16.137
[bleeping]

34:23.686 --> 34:24.937
We need to fight.

34:25.021 --> 34:27.857
You're jumping to conclusions.
Anything could've ripped the sail.

34:27.940 --> 34:28.900
Like what, Richard?

34:28.983 --> 34:31.986
A micro-meteorite. All that shit
we ejected from the shuttle bay.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.280
It just happened
to target our sole means of propulsion?

34:34.363 --> 34:35.698
Please. Just take a minute.

34:35.782 --> 34:38.159
Think things through
before you leave without a plan.

34:38.242 --> 34:41.871
Depressurize airlock. Authorization,
Niko Breckinridge, alpha-six-eight-three.

34:41.954 --> 34:43.206
Niko!

34:43.289 --> 34:46.042
-Niko! Niko, Niko!
-Depressurize shuttle bay.

34:46.125 --> 34:47.418
[air whooshing]

34:47.502 --> 34:49.128
-Open door.
-Niko!

34:50.088 --> 34:51.297
[gasps]

35:06.562 --> 35:07.396
Niko!

35:07.480 --> 35:08.981
[banging]

35:15.530 --> 35:16.906
[screams]

35:16.989 --> 35:19.784
It's attacking me! [gasping]

35:19.867 --> 35:21.369
[wailing]

35:21.452 --> 35:23.663
Help! Something struck me. I can't--

35:23.746 --> 35:25.414
[screams]

35:25.498 --> 35:27.416
Niko! There's nothing there.

35:27.500 --> 35:28.709
Look at me, Niko!

35:28.793 --> 35:30.378
Richard! [crying]

35:31.170 --> 35:32.713
[gasping]

35:32.797 --> 35:33.631
No, no!

35:34.215 --> 35:35.466
[sobbing] No, no!

35:35.550 --> 35:37.635
-[buzzing]
-No, no, no!

35:37.718 --> 35:40.555
Stay away! No! Richard!

35:41.139 --> 35:42.890
No! No!

35:49.188 --> 35:50.648
[birdsong]

35:55.319 --> 35:57.655
[knocking at door]

36:03.536 --> 36:05.830
-Hey.
-Hey. Let me in before someone sees.

36:06.831 --> 36:09.125
-What? Are you being followed?
-USIC, Seth.

36:09.625 --> 36:11.586
-I don't even know anymore.
-Okay.

36:12.295 --> 36:15.131
What's this information
you're holding back about the mission?

36:15.214 --> 36:16.465
About Niko's mission.

36:17.466 --> 36:19.844
We sent everything we collected
back to USIC.

36:19.927 --> 36:22.263
No, no, no, no.
You said there was something more.

36:22.763 --> 36:24.682
Something hidden on the Salvare.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.976
No, Erik. I didn't.

36:27.685 --> 36:29.812
You guys interviewed us, then released us,

36:29.896 --> 36:31.981
so I'm not sure what you're talking about.

36:32.064 --> 36:34.483
When you came back to Earth,
we had a conversation.

36:34.567 --> 36:38.946
Right. I told you
how much Niko loves you and Jana.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.907
And if I could trade places, I would.

36:40.990 --> 36:43.784
And you said
there was something you hid with William.

36:44.535 --> 36:45.369
Remember?

36:47.288 --> 36:48.873
I'm sorry Niko's not with us.

36:48.956 --> 36:50.208
We can get her back, right?

36:50.291 --> 36:53.502
No. I'm sorry, Erik. I-- I don't remember.

36:53.586 --> 36:56.714
Here's our hero.
Welcome back to Earth, Commander.

36:59.508 --> 37:02.595
What about the magnetar?
Is there anything you remember?

37:03.304 --> 37:05.723
Yeah. Uh, we encountered the magnetar…

37:05.806 --> 37:08.768
[intense whooshing and rumbling]

37:10.186 --> 37:11.896
Wait, wait… Why don't I remember?

37:14.148 --> 37:16.234
Hold on. We-- we were at USIC.

37:16.317 --> 37:18.694
Then we had our interviews,
I talked to Seth and…

37:19.403 --> 37:20.529
It's Seth.

37:21.364 --> 37:22.490
It's the implant.

37:22.990 --> 37:26.619
I-- I've seen it dig information
out of people's brains.

37:27.411 --> 37:29.288
'Cause whatever it is you're hiding,

37:29.372 --> 37:31.624
he's wiped every last memory of it.

37:34.961 --> 37:37.964
Okay. Let's see what would happen
if I extrapolated

37:38.047 --> 37:42.009
and used the magnetic power of .138 tesla.

37:42.802 --> 37:46.055
-[Salvare] Warning! System overload.
-[power builds and fades]

37:46.138 --> 37:51.143
And what would happen is I'd rip holes
throughout the entire fucking ship!

37:51.227 --> 37:52.395
Crying out loud.

37:52.478 --> 37:56.232
Why are you getting so frustrated because
things aren't going the way you want?

37:58.317 --> 37:59.277
You're not here.

38:00.945 --> 38:03.447
You're not here,
and this is not happenin'!

38:04.031 --> 38:05.616
What are you so afraid of?

38:09.328 --> 38:10.830
That you're going crazy?

38:10.913 --> 38:12.039
[William chuckles]

38:12.623 --> 38:13.666
[Niko] You can't.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.294
Open your eyes.

38:18.921 --> 38:19.755
There you go.

38:21.340 --> 38:22.425
You're okay.

38:22.508 --> 38:23.718
Why am I seein' you?

38:26.762 --> 38:28.222
You're light years away.

38:28.889 --> 38:30.891
Distance is relative, William.

38:30.975 --> 38:35.730
I'm halfway across the galaxy.
At least, that's where I think I am.

38:36.897 --> 38:40.318
In reality, I'm inside of you.

38:41.902 --> 38:42.778
I am too.

38:43.821 --> 38:45.990
So you can keep pushing us away…

38:47.158 --> 38:49.201
Or integrate us.

38:49.702 --> 38:52.455
Our code with your code.

38:52.538 --> 38:55.750
[Niko] The same code that made us,

38:57.376 --> 38:58.502
back into one.

39:00.546 --> 39:01.380
Say yes.

39:02.381 --> 39:06.052
Say yes, and you will remember everything.

39:08.429 --> 39:09.472
Everything.

39:11.182 --> 39:14.018
[Niko] You'll be the same William
you were before.

39:23.736 --> 39:24.612
[sighs]

39:39.794 --> 39:41.670
-[whooshing]
-[William] William Grey Walter.

39:41.754 --> 39:43.964
[echoing] One of the founding fathers
of cybernetics.

39:44.048 --> 39:45.091
[Niko, echoing] William.

39:45.174 --> 39:46.967
It's perfect. It's you.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.886
Iara is a part of you.

39:49.428 --> 39:52.139
[Iara, echoing] We need a bridge.
I can be that bridge.

39:52.723 --> 39:56.560
[Niko] A clean reinstall will kill you.
You have got to take control back.

39:56.644 --> 39:58.437
[William] You know
the mission comes first.

39:58.521 --> 40:00.606
Please, Niko. Do it.

40:04.110 --> 40:04.944
Niko.

40:06.529 --> 40:07.363
[Richard] Niko?

40:08.114 --> 40:09.156
Niko?

40:11.367 --> 40:12.326
[Niko sighs]

40:13.160 --> 40:14.161
Niko.

40:14.954 --> 40:16.247
Hey, Niko.

40:16.330 --> 40:18.707
-[gasps]
-Whoa, whoa. Relax, relax.

40:18.791 --> 40:21.627
-Relax? There is an Achaian on board.
-Niko. There isn't.

40:22.461 --> 40:24.422
I saw it come in the shuttle bay.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.382
You didn't.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.135
Don't believe me?

40:33.264 --> 40:35.599
The ship's under
too much atmospheric pressure.

40:36.809 --> 40:39.103
We're suffering nitrogen narcosis?

40:39.186 --> 40:40.187
Explains a lot.

40:40.938 --> 40:42.648
Your sense of paranoia and doom.

40:42.731 --> 40:46.569
My emotions all over the map.
My thoughts of suicide.

40:47.736 --> 40:50.531
And when you put on that suit,
which was correctly pressurized…

40:50.614 --> 40:54.326
The nitrogen in my blood escaped,
gave me the space version of the bends.

40:54.410 --> 40:56.537
Yeah, somethin' like that.

40:59.498 --> 41:01.917
Why didn't the ship's systems
pick up on the problems

41:02.001 --> 41:03.794
with the environmental controls?

41:03.878 --> 41:05.588
It's half a ship running on empty.

41:06.338 --> 41:08.549
The pressure's slowly returning to normal.

41:08.632 --> 41:10.176
-[sighs]
-We should be fine.

41:12.052 --> 41:12.887
Fine?

41:14.722 --> 41:16.765
We're stranded in the middle of nowhere.

41:16.849 --> 41:20.936
We have no propulsion system
and two weeks left of breathable oxygen.

41:21.020 --> 41:23.189
We are not fine.

41:25.691 --> 41:26.525
No.

41:27.109 --> 41:27.985
We're not.

41:30.279 --> 41:32.323
But, stupid us,

41:32.948 --> 41:35.034
we already drank all the best wine.

41:38.204 --> 41:39.371
[chuckles]

41:41.415 --> 41:43.250
I have been holding out on you.

41:45.920 --> 41:48.631
Meet me on the observation deck.
I'mma get cleaned up.

41:50.299 --> 41:51.467
[grunts]

41:52.218 --> 41:53.427
[sighs]

41:56.138 --> 41:58.641
This is old.

41:59.433 --> 42:02.102
-Like last millennium old.
-[chuckles]

42:02.186 --> 42:04.063
You brought this as carry-on?

42:04.146 --> 42:05.523
[laughs]

42:05.606 --> 42:08.651
-No. I smuggled it on board.
-Ah.

42:08.734 --> 42:12.363
I didn't have the heart
to jettison it out the airlock earlier.

42:16.784 --> 42:17.618
To Earth.

42:22.414 --> 42:23.415
To Earth.

42:36.178 --> 42:37.346
[Niko sighs]

42:43.143 --> 42:45.729
[whispers] I'm never gonna see them again.

42:48.524 --> 42:49.858
Richard…

42:55.281 --> 42:56.532
[sighs]

42:56.615 --> 43:01.036
You know, I thought,
despite it all, that I would just…

43:04.540 --> 43:05.791
[whispers] I don't know.

43:12.798 --> 43:15.050
We have enough pills for both of us.

43:20.264 --> 43:22.141
No reason to suffer, Niko.

43:32.818 --> 43:35.321
Just go to sleep and never wake up, huh?

44:09.480 --> 44:10.522
[sighs]

44:35.881 --> 44:37.675
-[alarm blares]
-[Salvare] Proximity warning.

44:39.760 --> 44:41.929
-It's the Achaia.
-[rumbling]

44:43.555 --> 44:45.015
[Niko] Open the Crow's Nest.

44:50.854 --> 44:52.272
That's not the Achaia.
