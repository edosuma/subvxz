01:31.133 --> 01:34.552
My Lord Brandon asks that you
attend him this evening, Sir William.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.346
-Pennington.
-Oh, the Southwells.

01:38.140 --> 01:40.641
How's your master, Boleyn?

01:40.851 --> 01:42.894
That's Lord Rochford to you,
Pennington.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.563
Sir William Pennington to you,
Southwell.

01:46.023 --> 01:49.609
And how is your master?
Master fucking Brandon?

01:49.777 --> 01:52.737
Does he still persist in using
foul and abusive language...

01:52.905 --> 01:55.990
...against my master's daughter,
Lady Anne, who's soon to be queen?

01:56.158 --> 01:58.993
-The duke can speak for himself.
-l'm asking you, Pennington.

01:59.161 --> 02:02.663
His Grace wants nothing to do
with the elevation of the king's whore.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.582
Who's a whore?

02:05.167 --> 02:07.752
-Let me pass.
-Not till you pay for that.

02:10.422 --> 02:13.090
-Run. Fetch the duke. Go.
-Get him, Sir William.

02:19.515 --> 02:21.474
Pennington.

02:26.605 --> 02:28.397
What do you think you're doing?

02:31.193 --> 02:34.403
You'll pay for those goods.

02:37.533 --> 02:41.661
-Father, l seek sanctuary in this place.
-Of course, my child.

02:44.039 --> 02:47.041
Put up your swords, gentlemen.
This is a place of God.

02:47.209 --> 02:51.462
-Defend yourself, Pennington.
-Dear God.

02:52.214 --> 02:54.715
You dishonour the Boleyn family
whom you serve.

02:54.925 --> 02:57.718
And you offend God
by offering violence here.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.306
Stop it. Stop.

03:02.474 --> 03:05.226
Now, for the love of God.
Enough is enough.

03:16.572 --> 03:19.657
You fool, Richard. You've killed him.

03:36.842 --> 03:40.344
Oh, my Lord, they've killed him.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.348
Murderers.

03:44.516 --> 03:47.768
Oh, my lord. My lord, l beg you,
in the name of our Lord.

03:47.978 --> 03:50.313
One murder
has been committed here already.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.023
You scum.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.150
-Your Grace, we--
-Shut up.

03:54.318 --> 03:58.070
-You're both dead men.
-My lord, listen. l beg you.

03:58.238 --> 04:02.909
Those who commit murder in church
are damned in the eyes of God.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.131
This is your doing, Boleyn.

04:30.395 --> 04:33.147
Lady Anne is not to be disturbed.

04:33.315 --> 04:36.025
Suddenly everyone is beating a path
to Lady Anne's door.

04:37.319 --> 04:39.028
Why do you suppose that is,
Mr. Wyatt?

04:39.196 --> 04:42.531
Because everyone prefers a rising sun
to a setting sun, Mr. Smeaton.

04:45.452 --> 04:48.454
-What are you writing at the moment?
-A satire.

04:49.539 --> 04:50.957
You find all this funny?

04:51.124 --> 04:54.251
Well, it has its funny side,
like all serious things.

04:55.045 --> 04:58.005
Well, for example--
And this will make you laugh, Mark.

04:58.173 --> 05:01.425
--Mr. Cromwell told me that l've been
appointed to the Privy Council.

05:01.593 --> 05:03.511
That's ridiculous.

05:03.679 --> 05:05.471
Everything in life is ridiculous.

05:05.639 --> 05:09.517
And to suppose otherwise
is human vanity.

05:09.685 --> 05:12.019
-Mr. Wyatt.
-My lady.

05:12.187 --> 05:14.480
-You know what?
-No, I don't.

05:14.648 --> 05:19.777
I have a furious hankering for apples,
such as l've never had before.

05:19.945 --> 05:23.197
-lt started three days ago.
-Apples?

05:23.365 --> 05:25.157
Yes, apples.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.369
The king told me
it was a sign l was pregnant...

05:28.578 --> 05:31.414
...but l said
it was nothing of the sort.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.419
What was that about?

05:39.006 --> 05:41.215
What news from France?

05:41.383 --> 05:44.218
None to give Your Majesty
any satisfaction.

05:44.386 --> 05:47.096
Although he promised
to make representations to the pope...

05:47.264 --> 05:50.516
...on Your Majesty's behalf,
King Francis did no such thing.

05:50.684 --> 05:51.809
Doesn't matter.

05:52.728 --> 05:55.688
What else should we have expected
from the King of France?

05:56.189 --> 05:59.650
The fact is, I now have a good reason,
a very good reason...

06:00.110 --> 06:01.944
...not to wait for the pope's decision.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.906
The annulment of my marriage
must be declared immediately.

06:07.242 --> 06:10.661
Well, as Your Majesty is head
of the Church now, you yourself--

06:10.829 --> 06:11.871
No.

06:12.205 --> 06:17.126
The annulment should still be decided
and declared by the Church proper...

06:17.294 --> 06:20.463
...that is to say,
the Archbishop of Canterbury.

06:21.631 --> 06:25.009
As Your Majesty knows, there remains
a vacancy for that position.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.345
I think I know exactly who will suit.

06:32.476 --> 06:34.769
Mr. Cranmer.

06:35.145 --> 06:36.270
Yes.

06:36.438 --> 06:39.648
-Your belongings from Germany.
-Thank you.

06:40.150 --> 06:43.152
If you could just-- Thank you, sir.
At last.

06:52.287 --> 06:54.163
Katharina.

06:55.040 --> 06:58.793
It's over now. You're here.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.842
I'm very relieved to see you, Thomas.
I thought I was going to die.

07:07.010 --> 07:10.179
It is not the nicest way to travel,
even for an illegal wife.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.390
It's over now.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.685
You're here now.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.064
Do you forgive me?

07:34.913 --> 07:39.125
So this is England?

07:39.709 --> 07:41.710
This is England.

07:44.214 --> 07:48.008
They want to make
Cranmer archbishop?

07:48.218 --> 07:51.929
I wonder if the pope knows
of the reputation Cranmer has here...

07:52.097 --> 07:55.975
...for being devoted heart and soul
to the Lutheran movement.

07:56.143 --> 07:59.061
He was once chaplain to the Boleyns.
He ought to be required...

07:59.229 --> 08:01.856
...to take a special oath
not to meddle with the divorce.

08:02.023 --> 08:05.526
Of course he'll meddle.
That's what they want.

08:05.735 --> 08:08.320
They don't care
about Holy Church anymore.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.030
They don't care about the people.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.200
The king, in his blindness,
fears no one but God.

08:13.368 --> 08:15.870
I fear for the queen.

08:16.288 --> 08:20.666
They say Anne Boleyn hates her
openly, and her daughter too.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.669
She has made threats
against the child.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.422
Those are dangerous words.

08:26.590 --> 08:30.342
Think also of the lives
of your own children.

08:50.906 --> 08:52.489
What is this?

08:52.657 --> 08:56.577
The bull, Sublimus Dei, Holy Father.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.080
Remind me.

09:00.290 --> 09:04.877
It forbids the enslavement of
the native peoples of the New World.

09:06.838 --> 09:08.672
Then we sign it very willingly.

09:08.840 --> 09:12.092
For the fact is, Campeggio,
that the kings of Europe...

09:12.302 --> 09:15.596
...have power but no morality.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.140
I must act as their conscience.

09:18.308 --> 09:21.727
They are my wilful children
and l their father...

09:21.895 --> 09:26.482
...leading them along the paths
of righteousness.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.401
So help me God.

09:40.372 --> 09:41.413
And this?

09:41.581 --> 09:43.457
The King of England
asks your approval...

09:43.625 --> 09:45.793
...to appoint
a new Archbishop of Canterbury...

09:45.961 --> 09:49.338
...after the death
of Archbishop Warham.

09:49.631 --> 09:51.632
And people say he doesn't care.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.469
What is the name of the candidate?

09:55.637 --> 09:57.054
Thomas Cranmer.

09:57.639 --> 10:00.224
What do we know of this Cranmer?

10:00.392 --> 10:02.268
Virtually nothing.

10:02.560 --> 10:06.313
He's an obscure cleric. A nobody.

10:06.481 --> 10:10.401
There are strong rumours
that he is a secret Lutheran.

10:10.986 --> 10:13.821
Then we should not approve
his appointment.

10:13.989 --> 10:18.284
No. Not in my opinion, Holiness.

10:18.493 --> 10:19.952
And yet...

10:20.870 --> 10:23.414
...we want to give
the English Church the opportunity...

10:23.581 --> 10:28.627
...to return to its first allegiance,
and our true faith.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.505
We want to please the king.

10:32.299 --> 10:36.051
We want to make him
beholden to us.

10:37.012 --> 10:40.139
What better way to please him
than to approve the appointment...

10:40.307 --> 10:42.599
...of a nobody?

10:42.767 --> 10:43.851
After all...

10:44.019 --> 10:49.773
...what harm can a nobody
inflict upon our Holy Church?

11:16.092 --> 11:17.134
Your Grace.

11:18.094 --> 11:21.263
We are most pleased to see you
confirmed as archbishop.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.433
Your Majesty, I confess...

11:24.601 --> 11:28.228
...l had some scruples
about accepting the office...

11:28.938 --> 11:31.148
...since l must receive it
at the pope's hand.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.776
You are not beholden to Rome.

11:34.069 --> 11:35.527
Only to God...

11:36.071 --> 11:37.821
...and me.

11:38.698 --> 11:42.409
Now, archbishop, as principal minister
of spiritual jurisdiction in our realm...

11:42.577 --> 11:47.748
...l ask you to determine,
once and for all, my great matter.

11:48.083 --> 11:51.251
Whether or not
my first marriage was valid.

11:52.087 --> 11:55.464
Majesty, I shall address the question
with the greatest urgency...

11:55.632 --> 11:58.092
...and presently
pronounce my verdict.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.685
Mr. Cromwell.

12:09.187 --> 12:10.396
Majesty?

12:10.563 --> 12:14.483
Since the departure of Thomas More,
England has lacked a chancellor.

12:16.778 --> 12:22.241
-l am trusting you to fill that office.
-Majesty.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.749
Make way there.

12:39.217 --> 12:42.010
Where is he? Where's Suffolk?

12:55.733 --> 13:00.779
We are gathered here together,
in the sight of God Almighty...

13:01.030 --> 13:06.118
...to join in holy matrimony
this man and this woman.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.369
Will you both answer...

13:07.537 --> 13:10.914
...that you will keep
all these coming days rightful...

13:11.082 --> 13:17.212
...with rightwiseness and discretion,
with mercy and truth...

13:17.380 --> 13:19.673
...so help you God?

13:23.928 --> 13:25.971
Master Brereton.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.058
It's no use...

13:30.685 --> 13:31.935
...l failed.

13:32.687 --> 13:35.355
And l can no longer bear this place.

13:38.193 --> 13:40.944
Then go where your heart tells you...

13:43.656 --> 13:45.324
...with God's blessing.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.183
My lady, the Duke of Suffolk.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.106
Your Grace.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.109
My lady.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.532
His Majesty has ordered me here.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.784
He has asked me to tell--

14:28.952 --> 14:32.704
He warns you
not to try to return to him...

14:32.914 --> 14:36.124
...since he has now married
Lady Anne.

14:37.460 --> 14:40.879
From henceforth, you must abstain
from using the title of queen.

14:41.130 --> 14:44.633
You will now be referred to
as the Princess Dowager of Wales.

14:47.387 --> 14:51.139
You must also cut
your household expenses.

14:54.352 --> 14:58.438
In his generosity, the king allows you
to keep your property...

14:58.648 --> 15:01.275
...but will no longer
pay your servants' wages...

15:01.651 --> 15:03.527
...or your household expenses.

15:06.072 --> 15:08.282
And what of my daughter?

15:08.700 --> 15:11.785
-What of Mary? May I see her?
-Madam.

15:13.955 --> 15:15.581
Forgive me.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.801
Do you know something,
Mr. Brandon?

15:30.013 --> 15:32.139
If l had to choose...

15:32.307 --> 15:36.435
...between extreme happiness
and extreme sorrow...

15:37.228 --> 15:39.771
...l would always choose sorrow.

15:43.985 --> 15:46.320
For when you are happy, you forget.

15:46.487 --> 15:49.698
You forget about spiritual things,
you forget about God.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.578
But in your sorrow...

15:55.872 --> 15:58.123
...he is always with you.

16:06.049 --> 16:09.259
May the Lord bless you and keep you,
my lady.

16:38.956 --> 16:45.462
As long as l live, l will call myself
the Queen of England.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.094
Amen.

16:59.102 --> 17:00.894
Your Grace, l have some news.

17:01.062 --> 17:04.648
I have learned that Mr. Cromwell
is to present another bill to Parliament:

17:04.816 --> 17:07.693
The Act of Restraint of Appeals.

17:07.860 --> 17:12.030
And under its innocuous title does it
conceal its most revolutionary intent.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.324
What does it say?

17:15.576 --> 17:18.412
"This realm of England is an empire...

17:18.579 --> 17:21.456
...governed by one supreme head
and king...

17:21.624 --> 17:24.710
...and owing no allegiance
except to God."

17:24.877 --> 17:27.796
In future, all final appeals
on spiritual matters...

17:27.964 --> 17:31.591
...will be heard not in Rome
but in England, where the king....

17:31.801 --> 17:35.929
"The king will now enjoy
plenary, whole and entire power...

17:36.097 --> 17:39.808
...preeminence, authority,
prerogative and jurisdiction."

17:39.976 --> 17:42.102
Which means, l take it...

17:42.311 --> 17:46.523
...that the act prohibits the hearing
of the king's nullity suit by the pope.

17:46.691 --> 17:49.359
And, by the same token,
bars the queen...

17:49.527 --> 17:52.571
...from appealing to the Vatican
against any decision made here.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.156
Exactly.

17:54.323 --> 17:57.743
No English sovereign has ever been
granted such absolute power.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.619
-Poor Catherine.
-lt's worse.

17:59.829 --> 18:02.539
There are rumours that the king
has married Anne in secret.

18:02.707 --> 18:06.084
-No.
-And that she is already with child.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.296
Your Eminences...

18:09.464 --> 18:12.883
...at the conclusion of this properly
constituted ecclesiastical court...

18:13.050 --> 18:17.971
...l am ready to pronounce the verdict
agreed by us all.

18:18.514 --> 18:23.894
It is a pity that certain persons refused
to come here and testify...

18:24.061 --> 18:28.273
...but that in itself holds no bearing
upon our conclusions.

18:28.441 --> 18:33.445
Which are that the union
between King Henry of England...

18:33.613 --> 18:37.073
...and Catherine of Aragon
is declared null and void.

18:37.241 --> 18:40.494
And therefore, that the king's marriage
to Anne Boleyn...

18:40.661 --> 18:47.167
...is declared both valid and lawful,
in the eyes of God.

18:53.382 --> 18:54.800
Sir.

19:01.474 --> 19:04.184
-Elizabeth.
-Not that.

19:05.394 --> 19:06.895
Then what?

19:07.188 --> 19:12.484
I came on behalf of my lady,
though not with her permission.

19:14.529 --> 19:17.781
Thomas, she is in
a most wretched way...

19:18.533 --> 19:20.951
...abandoned and betrayed.

19:21.244 --> 19:25.497
It seems so cruel of the king
to humiliate her in every way...

19:25.832 --> 19:27.916
...pretending to marry that harlot.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.086
What?

19:31.671 --> 19:33.630
Did you not know?

19:34.006 --> 19:39.678
The Duke of Suffolk came
to tell her that the king has married.

19:40.555 --> 19:44.057
Anne Boleyn?

19:53.526 --> 19:55.527
But what can l do about any of that?

19:55.695 --> 20:00.240
You are now a Privy Councillor,
and a client of Mr. Cromwell.

20:00.449 --> 20:03.159
I thought that you could speak up
for my mistress.

20:03.953 --> 20:08.039
Mr. Cromwell is the least likely man
to sympathise with your mistress.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.668
But what about you?

20:12.753 --> 20:16.965
If you still have feelings for me,
you would speak out for her.

20:22.013 --> 20:23.763
I'm sorry.

21:03.512 --> 21:08.475
As the successor of St. Peter,
I do solemnly condemn...

21:08.643 --> 21:13.855
...the separation of the King of England
from Catherine of Aragon...

21:14.023 --> 21:20.528
...and his subsequent secret marriage,
which l declare null and void.

21:21.364 --> 21:27.327
This matter of the validity
of His Majesty's marriage...

21:27.536 --> 21:29.829
...can only be decided by the curia...

21:30.039 --> 21:34.042
...which has not yet reached
its conclusion.

21:35.336 --> 21:41.216
I will give the king until September
to take back his former wife...

21:41.384 --> 21:44.678
...on pain of excommunication.

21:45.388 --> 21:48.640
Which is separation
from Holy Church...

21:49.600 --> 21:52.060
...from Communion...

21:52.645 --> 21:55.355
...and from God.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.191
Thank you, Your Excellencies.

21:58.359 --> 22:03.697
You may communicate my words
to your masters everywhere.

22:04.198 --> 22:07.158
Come with me, Master Brereton.

22:18.421 --> 22:21.923
Holy Father, this is the young English
gentleman I was telling you about...

22:22.091 --> 22:24.718
...who brought us the news
from the English court.

22:24.885 --> 22:26.886
Master William Brereton.

22:27.471 --> 22:28.722
My son.

22:32.810 --> 22:36.980
We are grateful to you for
bringing news of these terrible events.

22:37.148 --> 22:40.900
And for all you have tried to do
to prevent them.

22:41.110 --> 22:45.405
I tried to rid you of her, unfortunately,
Holy Father, l failed.

22:45.614 --> 22:47.490
Who knows, my son?

22:47.658 --> 22:51.619
God works in mysterious ways.

22:51.912 --> 22:56.624
Cardinal Campeggio tells me
you want to stay in Rome now...

22:56.792 --> 23:00.962
...and not return to England.
Is that correct?

23:01.130 --> 23:02.630
Yes, Holy Father.

23:04.800 --> 23:08.011
I would rather remain
with the flock of the faithful.

23:13.184 --> 23:15.935
Recently, Master Brereton...

23:16.145 --> 23:20.148
...l have ordained a new
and very special holy order.

23:20.316 --> 23:26.112
They are the miliantis ecclesiae,
the soldiers of Christ.

23:26.280 --> 23:29.074
These Jesuits, as they are called...

23:29.241 --> 23:34.037
...these soldiers
will go where others fear...

23:34.205 --> 23:37.123
...where often
they will meet great danger...

23:37.291 --> 23:39.793
...in order
to promote the Catholic faith...

23:39.960 --> 23:45.048
...and take the word of God
to heathens and heretics.

23:45.216 --> 23:50.553
I see already your passion
for this cause, and l beg you...

23:50.721 --> 23:52.806
...join the order.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.892
Join the crusade against heresy...

23:56.060 --> 24:00.730
...and return to England,
even at the risk of martyrdom.

24:11.992 --> 24:14.953
-Mr. Cromwell.
-Majesty.

24:15.329 --> 24:17.205
Your Majesty.

24:24.213 --> 24:26.464
How are the preparations
for the coronation?

24:26.632 --> 24:28.591
They're going well, Majesty.

24:36.100 --> 24:40.937
I want the people to love
their new queen as I love her.

24:42.022 --> 24:46.359
And if l can love her,
why shouldn't they?

24:47.736 --> 24:50.780
I assure you, Majesty,
they will love her...

24:50.948 --> 24:53.908
...and shall have every reason
to do so.

25:07.173 --> 25:10.049
Silk, yes, I like it.

25:10.593 --> 25:13.011
Madame la Marquise.

25:13.387 --> 25:16.389
No. Just sister.

25:16.807 --> 25:19.267
How are you, sister?

25:20.394 --> 25:22.687
How are both of you?

25:23.147 --> 25:25.815
We are both very well.

25:25.983 --> 25:30.361
Listen, the king and l have visited
a famous astrologer...

25:30.529 --> 25:34.657
...who confirmed what the physicians
say, and what I know in my heart:

25:34.825 --> 25:39.204
That it's a boy.
The king is overjoyed.

25:39.371 --> 25:44.626
He keeps wanting to tell people
but I tell him not to. Not yet anyway.

25:45.127 --> 25:47.212
Come and look at these.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.797
Mr. Holbein has been designing
all kinds of things...

25:49.965 --> 25:52.133
...for the coronation procession.

25:52.301 --> 25:57.180
They're so beautiful.
Mr. Holbein is indeed a genius.

26:00.851 --> 26:02.727
Are you scared?

26:08.317 --> 26:10.485
Anne, what is it?

26:15.407 --> 26:16.950
What?

26:18.744 --> 26:20.995
Oh, it's nothing.

26:29.505 --> 26:31.631
What's wrong, husband?

26:32.258 --> 26:36.094
I'm going to have to attend on the king
and that bitch of his at her coronation.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.596
What did Wolsey used to call her?

26:39.348 --> 26:41.224
The black crow.

26:41.392 --> 26:43.643
Can you not plead
some indisposition?

26:43.852 --> 26:47.730
I could even though the king has made
me high constable for the day.

26:47.898 --> 26:50.149
But if I did, His Majesty
would remove my head.

26:50.359 --> 26:52.485
And then I should be
genuinely indisposed.

26:52.653 --> 26:55.697
Very well. So keep your head.

26:55.864 --> 27:00.451
It's a pretty head, in any case.
And l don't want to lose it either.

27:02.871 --> 27:05.665
But store up your knowledge
and your anger.

27:05.874 --> 27:09.127
Don't act impulsively,
it's always a mistake.

27:09.295 --> 27:13.006
But one day, with others so disposed,
use them both...

27:13.173 --> 27:18.469
...and if you can,
bring her down and destroy her.

27:23.892 --> 27:27.020
-Make way.
-See to it, you lazy scags.

27:27.896 --> 27:30.023
Heave.

27:44.038 --> 27:46.331
Hear ye, hear ye...

27:46.498 --> 27:51.002
...make way for His Gracious Majesty,
King Henry...

27:51.170 --> 27:55.298
...and the Lady Anne Boleyn,
Marquess of Pembroke.

27:55.466 --> 27:59.302
Make way, make way.

27:59.970 --> 28:02.347
Where are the crowds?

28:04.224 --> 28:06.351
Where are the people?

28:49.770 --> 28:51.896
-What the hell happened here?
-He's dead.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.981
-Shot.
-My God.

28:54.191 --> 28:55.483
Keep the procession moving.

29:08.205 --> 29:09.247
I can't.

29:12.334 --> 29:14.460
-What was that?
-An accident.

29:14.628 --> 29:16.754
Nothing for Your Majesty
to be concerned about.

29:17.214 --> 29:20.091
For nothing on Earth
is going to spoil this day.

29:24.179 --> 29:30.393
Come, O Holy Spirit, and visit us.

29:30.561 --> 29:32.937
Implant in our hearts...

29:33.105 --> 29:36.524
...that which you have made,
Your Grace.

29:37.151 --> 29:39.986
Through you alone...

29:40.154 --> 29:43.739
...we know the father.

29:44.283 --> 29:47.034
Be this our constant belief...

29:47.578 --> 29:50.538
...that you proceed from him.

29:51.373 --> 29:54.542
Illuminate our senses...

29:54.710 --> 29:57.962
...fill our hearts with love...

29:58.172 --> 30:01.716
...diminish our bodily desires...

30:01.884 --> 30:05.887
...strengthen our virtues always.

30:06.096 --> 30:07.430
Amen.

30:12.603 --> 30:14.312
Wait.

30:19.067 --> 30:20.860
Give it to me.

30:29.077 --> 30:33.372
With this, St. Edward's crown...

30:33.582 --> 30:38.336
...l do solemnly crown you
Queen of England.

31:00.609 --> 31:04.403
And here are the two sceptres
of the sovereign.

31:05.239 --> 31:09.992
Honour and grace
be to our Queen Anne.

31:10.369 --> 31:13.746
May you prosper, go forward...

31:13.914 --> 31:17.833
...and may you bear
a new son of the king's blood.

31:18.752 --> 31:24.215
There was an assassination attempt,
either upon you or upon the queen.

31:24.925 --> 31:28.719
-A groom was killed.
-Thank you, Mr. Cromwell.

31:28.887 --> 31:34.141
Sweetheart, how was that?
Did you like the city?

31:34.309 --> 31:38.563
-Was not everything well done?
-Yes, it was beautiful.

31:39.189 --> 31:41.440
But so few people.

31:41.650 --> 31:45.570
And they kept their hats
on their heads. And no one shouted.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.950
It was more like a funeral
than a parade.

31:53.912 --> 31:56.289
You have a party to go to.

31:57.958 --> 32:02.211
I want you to be happy.
I want you to smile.

32:02.671 --> 32:06.299
Remember, you are my queen now.

32:09.177 --> 32:15.224
-l know, but--
-l said, you are my queen.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.896
Everyone is waiting for you.

32:51.094 --> 32:53.471
I don't see Bishop Fisher here.

32:53.764 --> 32:55.473
No, Your Majesty.

32:55.641 --> 33:00.394
And where is Sir Thomas More?
I don't see him here either.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.355
Was he not invited?

33:02.522 --> 33:05.316
He was most certainly invited,
Your Majesty.

33:08.487 --> 33:11.280
Then he chose not to attend.

33:14.368 --> 33:16.744
Hungry, ladies.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.251
Your Grace.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.465
Since you were appointed
high constable today...

33:29.633 --> 33:32.051
...what happened in the procession
was your fault.

33:32.260 --> 33:34.387
I want to know who fired that shot.

33:34.554 --> 33:37.682
I am already endeavouring
to find out, my lord.

33:39.059 --> 33:41.644
Oh, l sincerely trust that you are,
Your Grace.

33:43.271 --> 33:48.901
I have not forgotten Pennington.
For l feel that was your fault.

34:02.332 --> 34:03.541
Here's to the Boleyns.

34:06.294 --> 34:08.087
The Boleyns.

34:09.923 --> 34:11.590
England's new queen.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.008
-Show us your hands.
-Next.

34:13.176 --> 34:15.553
-Hands.
-Next one.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.805
-Go on.
-Hands.

34:18.849 --> 34:22.017
-Move on. Now, take your gloves off.
-Show me your hands.

34:22.185 --> 34:23.519
Gloves off.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.480
Take your gloves off.
Move through.

34:26.648 --> 34:28.399
Hands. Come through.

34:28.567 --> 34:32.236
-You, show me your hands.
-Make way. Make way there.

34:32.487 --> 34:35.239
Move back. Move back.

34:35.407 --> 34:38.701
Move back, please. Move back.

34:51.339 --> 34:55.926
Oh, Mary. And it's all for me.

35:00.724 --> 35:02.224
How was the coronation?

35:02.392 --> 35:07.062
It was a cold, meagre
and uncomfortable thing.

35:07.939 --> 35:11.233
And your absence was noted,
Sir Thomas.

35:12.861 --> 35:15.237
How is Her Majesty bearing up
under all of this?

35:15.405 --> 35:17.239
I am no longer allowed to see her.

35:17.407 --> 35:20.910
And it is increasingly difficult for us
to exchange letters.

35:21.912 --> 35:23.913
I'm gonna try and see her.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.207
That would be so dangerous.

35:26.374 --> 35:29.543
Even to speak a word in her praise
is to risk imprisonment.

35:29.711 --> 35:31.587
Nevertheless.

35:35.884 --> 35:38.677
You know, I have been thinking
about the past...

35:39.679 --> 35:41.430
...when I believed the king...

35:41.598 --> 35:45.100
...to be the most enlightened
and promising prince in Christendom.

35:46.895 --> 35:50.397
I was sure his reign
would be a golden age.

35:51.733 --> 35:53.943
I had such high hopes.

35:59.658 --> 36:03.410
Bishop Fisher has been placed
under house arrest.

36:03.954 --> 36:06.789
You should beware yourself,
Eustace.

36:15.924 --> 36:22.429
You will all be honourable, discreet,
just and thrifty in your conduct.

36:23.139 --> 36:26.600
You will present
a godly spectacle to others...

36:26.768 --> 36:28.644
...attend Mass daily...

36:29.187 --> 36:32.064
...and display a virtuous demeanour.

36:33.859 --> 36:36.944
On pain of instant dismissal
and banishment...

36:37.529 --> 36:43.284
...you must not quarrel, swear
or say evil and lewd things.

36:43.451 --> 36:46.996
Nor ever behave lewdly.

36:50.166 --> 36:54.545
You will set a standard
for everyone else.

36:55.839 --> 36:57.256
Do you understand?

36:57.465 --> 36:59.466
Yes, Your Majesty.

37:04.556 --> 37:07.224
And you, don't go to brothels.

37:12.606 --> 37:18.068
I will keep here a copy
of Tyndale's English Bible.

37:18.361 --> 37:22.281
All of you are free to read it and
draw spiritual nourishment from it...

37:22.490 --> 37:25.659
...for the old days are gone.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.830
Everything is changed now.

37:30.624 --> 37:33.542
Thanks to His Majesty,
you have all been delivered...

37:33.710 --> 37:37.087
...from the darkness and bondage
of papal thraldom...

37:37.255 --> 37:40.132
...idolatry and superstition.

37:42.135 --> 37:44.511
This is a new beginning.

37:45.263 --> 37:49.141
For me. For you.

37:50.352 --> 37:52.519
And for England.

38:09.245 --> 38:10.829
Sir.

38:12.248 --> 38:16.710
Lady Mary, I have come to inform you
of the judgements made recently...

38:16.878 --> 38:19.630
...by His Grace,
the Archbishop of Canterbury.

38:20.757 --> 38:24.802
His Majesty's marriage to your mother
has been declared null and void.

38:25.178 --> 38:27.429
Your mother was never legally
Queen of England...

38:27.597 --> 38:30.057
...and must now accept
the title of Dowager Princess.

38:30.767 --> 38:33.769
Just as you no longer have the right
to call yourself princess.

38:33.937 --> 38:37.606
But from now on must be known to all
as Lady Mary.

38:38.441 --> 38:39.984
At the same time...

38:40.151 --> 38:42.528
...his Majesty's recent marriage
to Queen Anne...

38:42.696 --> 38:44.613
...has been declared legal and valid.

38:45.240 --> 38:48.450
Her coronation took place
in London this past week.

38:48.618 --> 38:52.371
I know of no Queen of England
save my mother.

38:52.580 --> 38:55.874
And l will accept no other queen
except my mother.

38:57.335 --> 39:00.045
In which case, I have to tell you
that you are forbidden...

39:00.213 --> 39:04.091
...to communicate in any way with
your mother from this day forward.

39:05.719 --> 39:07.386
May I not even write to her?

39:08.263 --> 39:10.681
Not even a farewell note...

39:11.016 --> 39:15.894
...considering your intransigence.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.740
Sir Thomas More, my lady.

39:34.914 --> 39:37.124
Sir Thomas.

39:40.295 --> 39:42.129
Majesty.

39:42.756 --> 39:45.841
Forgive me for
receiving you like this...

39:46.342 --> 39:48.552
...but l do not feel well.

39:51.056 --> 39:53.265
What you suffer...

39:53.433 --> 39:56.560
...is known to a great many people,
both here and abroad.

39:57.395 --> 40:02.274
As is the injustice of it, as well as
the grace with which you endure it.

40:04.486 --> 40:09.281
Now it seems, l must cease
to call myself queen...

40:11.284 --> 40:15.704
...even though l was crowned so,
and anointed.

40:16.414 --> 40:19.166
They say that if l refuse...

40:19.918 --> 40:23.253
...the king will withdraw
his fatherly love for my daughter.

40:26.674 --> 40:28.884
I shall not yield...

40:29.969 --> 40:34.681
...neither for my daughter's sake
or anyone else's.

40:38.853 --> 40:42.898
Not for a thousand deaths
would l consent to damn my soul...

40:43.191 --> 40:47.319
...or that of my husband the king.

40:51.199 --> 40:53.659
Please forgive me again,
Sir Thomas.

40:53.827 --> 40:57.996
I am not very used to
visitors anymore.

40:59.249 --> 41:03.794
They are mostly forbidden me.
How did you get permission?

41:04.838 --> 41:06.630
I wrote to Mr. Cromwell personally.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.926
Then you are a brave man.

41:13.138 --> 41:15.722
I would be a coward to do otherwise.

41:16.891 --> 41:21.728
I cannot pretend to be detached
from these events.

41:33.199 --> 41:35.701
I've been encouraging
your supporters in Parliament...

41:35.869 --> 41:42.291
...and elsewhere, to speak their minds
and stand up for you.

41:42.458 --> 41:44.501
Thank you.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.546
Sir Thomas, thank you.

41:48.756 --> 41:49.798
Majesty.

42:18.036 --> 42:19.912
Anne.

42:29.923 --> 42:32.382
Sweetheart.

42:36.429 --> 42:39.139
I can't. Not now.

42:40.433 --> 42:42.476
While the baby....

43:22.600 --> 43:24.643
Exquisite, isn't she?

43:32.360 --> 43:33.819
Lady Eleanor Luke.

43:33.987 --> 43:36.780
Her family has an estate
in Oxfordshire.

43:39.909 --> 43:42.369
Shall l talk to her, on your behalf?

44:10.606 --> 44:13.317
That was exquisite.

44:22.118 --> 44:24.703
How do you like life at court, Mark?

44:25.621 --> 44:27.581
I feel....

44:28.041 --> 44:30.459
-l feel twice fortunate, my lord.
-Twice?

44:30.626 --> 44:32.711
Once for being allowed
to come here...

44:32.920 --> 44:37.007
...and twice for the patronage
of your family.

44:37.175 --> 44:40.886
We like to patronize artists,
men of talent.

44:41.054 --> 44:43.055
The painter Holbein stayed with us...

44:43.222 --> 44:46.475
...and my sister supports
many musicians and choirs.

44:47.101 --> 44:52.022
Yes, well, your sister
is quite a talented musician herself.

44:53.566 --> 44:55.942
As well as
a very beautiful young woman.

44:57.570 --> 44:58.945
Even though....

44:59.947 --> 45:01.448
"Even though"?

45:03.076 --> 45:05.577
Not as beautiful as her brother.

45:20.676 --> 45:21.927
What's this?

45:22.095 --> 45:25.639
The final decision
of the curia in Rome.

45:50.790 --> 45:52.999
They have found for Catherine.

45:53.835 --> 45:55.627
They declare
my new marriage invalid...

45:55.795 --> 45:59.631
...and any children produced from it,
illegitimate.

46:01.300 --> 46:04.010
The pope threatens
to excommunicate me...

46:04.178 --> 46:06.930
...if I do not return to Catherine.

46:11.769 --> 46:12.811
He's too late.

46:17.358 --> 46:21.695
Hold on. Hold on.

46:22.321 --> 46:24.030
Hold on.

46:26.242 --> 46:28.201
Come, pray.

46:30.538 --> 46:31.788
Oh, here it comes.

46:31.956 --> 46:34.624
And l want you to organise jousts,
banquets and masques...

46:34.792 --> 46:37.252
...to celebrate the birth of my son.

46:38.087 --> 46:41.423
I can't decide whether to call him
Henry or Edward.

46:41.591 --> 46:43.091
-Your Majesty.
-Oh, Your Majesty.

46:43.259 --> 46:46.470
I've asked the French ambassador
to hold him during his christening.

46:46.637 --> 46:49.097
If he drops him, it's war.

46:49.265 --> 46:51.683
It's here, Anne. lt's here.

46:53.686 --> 46:55.520
Push.

46:55.688 --> 46:57.272
-Push.
-Push, push.

47:04.071 --> 47:06.406
-What is it? What's happened?
-Nothing.

47:06.574 --> 47:07.657
Nothing.

47:07.825 --> 47:12.078
Your Majesty has given birth
to a very healthy baby girl.

47:28.387 --> 47:30.472
Did you not find
such occurrences shocking?

47:30.640 --> 47:32.557
Your Majesty, I am a Venetian.

47:32.725 --> 47:35.310
I come from a city
where all the men are gamblers...

47:35.478 --> 47:40.232
...and all the women, whores.
What is there to be shocked about?

48:06.926 --> 48:08.802
Majesty.

48:19.438 --> 48:21.565
I'm so sorry.

48:25.444 --> 48:27.696
You and I are both young...

48:27.863 --> 48:31.366
...and by God's grace,
boys will follow.

49:02.690 --> 49:05.483
-Lady Eleanor.
-Your Majesty.

49:21.709 --> 49:25.337
-Do you play chess?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

49:26.922 --> 49:28.715
Come, let's play.

49:47.026 --> 49:49.527
That's my first move.
