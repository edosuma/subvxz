WEBVTT

00:56.223 --> 00:58.725
(gentle music)

01:28.045 --> 01:29.715
- [Cassidy] Darkness and light.

01:30.883 --> 01:31.800
Evil and good.

01:33.384 --> 01:35.429
War and peace.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.513
Them and us.

01:38.598 --> 01:42.436
Everyone knows that one could
not exist without the other.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.771
And between the two,
there is a balance.

01:49.151 --> 01:52.154
Some say that before
the lands disappeared,

01:52.154 --> 01:54.740
birds were able to migrate
between the continents.

01:56.991 --> 02:00.204
They used a wind called uplift.

02:00.204 --> 02:02.372
You don't have to flap
your wings to stay up,

02:02.372 --> 02:03.624
but you also don't fall.

02:05.334 --> 02:11.465
You stay in the middle
effortlessly resting in the air.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.721
But there are no
uplift winds anymore

02:17.721 --> 02:19.973
(anxious music)

02:19.973 --> 02:21.558
because we ruined the balance.

02:24.102 --> 02:27.105
(waves thundering)

02:31.485 --> 02:34.321
(thunder rumbling)

02:34.321 --> 02:35.155
The dinghy.

02:37.699 --> 02:38.492
- Here.

02:39.535 --> 02:40.369
- Hold on.

02:41.620 --> 02:42.454
Got it.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.210
Baines, up top.

02:52.339 --> 02:55.091
(waves crashing)

02:57.302 --> 03:00.180
- [Sullivan] Woo, look at 'em.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.558
(Sullivan laughing)

03:02.558 --> 03:07.729
(wind whistling)
(rain splattering)

03:17.072 --> 03:19.908
(thunder rumbling)

03:28.584 --> 03:31.461
(walls rumbling)

03:35.883 --> 03:38.969
(chains clattering)

03:40.679 --> 03:43.432
(winch whirring)

03:45.058 --> 03:48.145
(wave rumbling)

03:48.145 --> 03:51.106
(rain splattering)

03:56.695 --> 03:58.238
- Status, Baines?

03:59.865 --> 04:01.658
- [Baines] On winch.

04:01.658 --> 04:02.492
- It's a nine.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.745
20 minutes to impact.

04:04.745 --> 04:09.917
Secure the genny.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.587
(rain splattering)

04:13.587 --> 04:14.755
Cassidy?

04:14.755 --> 04:17.132
- Finishing on platform.

04:17.132 --> 04:18.591
- Did he say nine?

04:18.591 --> 04:19.426
- Hook it.

04:21.762 --> 04:22.721
Come on, Sully.

04:24.598 --> 04:25.849
Hook it.

04:25.849 --> 04:28.936
(wave crashing)

04:28.936 --> 04:31.104
The net, the net.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.982
(tense music)

04:33.982 --> 04:36.235
God damn it, Sully.

04:36.235 --> 04:37.486
- I got it.

04:37.486 --> 04:39.029
Get on the winch.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.784
(items clattering)

04:46.620 --> 04:49.289
(tense music)

04:58.632 --> 05:01.426
(winch clicking)

05:09.434 --> 05:12.187
(pipes rattling)

05:14.940 --> 05:18.026
(water splattering)

05:18.026 --> 05:19.695
(Baines sighing)

05:19.695 --> 05:21.321
- [Hendrichs] Five
minutes to impact.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.490
Secure the doors.

05:23.490 --> 05:26.159
- [Cassidy] Come
on, Sully, leave it.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.871
(Sullivan groaning)

05:28.871 --> 05:31.748
(waves crashing)

05:31.748 --> 05:34.418
(tense music)

05:39.339 --> 05:40.132
- Fuck.

05:41.175 --> 05:44.178
(Baines groaning)

05:46.054 --> 05:48.807
- [Cassidy] Sullivan, lets go.

05:48.807 --> 05:51.268
(tense music)

05:55.397 --> 05:58.275
(Baines groaning)

06:01.612 --> 06:03.238
(rain splattering)

06:03.238 --> 06:06.325
(Sullivan grunting)

06:10.621 --> 06:13.373
(winch whirring)

06:22.549 --> 06:27.679
(winch thudding)
(Sullivan groaning)

06:33.560 --> 06:36.647
(Baines groaning)

06:36.647 --> 06:39.149
(tense music)

06:43.487 --> 06:46.365
(Baines coughing)

06:50.077 --> 06:52.746
(wave crashing)

06:53.956 --> 06:57.417
(items rattling)

06:57.417 --> 07:00.003
(tense music)

07:13.684 --> 07:16.353
(water booming)

07:32.202 --> 07:34.997
(winch clicking)

07:40.919 --> 07:42.004
- We're fucked.

07:51.346 --> 07:54.725
(waves gently lapping)

08:24.379 --> 08:27.591
(generator churning)

08:35.349 --> 08:38.519
(generator chugging)

08:41.522 --> 08:44.274
(fist thumping)

08:48.654 --> 08:51.573
(metre crackling)

08:59.998 --> 09:02.751
(lever creaking)

09:20.978 --> 09:23.647
(door creaking)

09:26.275 --> 09:29.027
(door thudding)

09:29.027 --> 09:31.572
(tap creaking)

09:32.865 --> 09:35.450
(hand thudding)

09:42.790 --> 09:45.460
(hand thudding)

09:51.300 --> 09:53.427
- Thieving bastard.

09:58.891 --> 10:01.852
- [Hendrichs] It took two hours
five from horizon to impact.

10:01.852 --> 10:03.937
- Doesn't leave much
time to scavenge.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.189
If it gets any faster then-

10:05.189 --> 10:07.149
- If it gets faster,
we get faster.

10:07.149 --> 10:09.776
- How about the fact that
the storm was two days early?

10:09.776 --> 10:11.778
Any earlier and the relief
boat won't have time

10:11.778 --> 10:13.071
to get out and back.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.823
- Assuming they see
fit to send one.

10:16.575 --> 10:19.953
- We use the outboard.
- We can't spare the diesel.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.289
Unless we cut our genny usage.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.208
Also, radiation levels are up

10:24.208 --> 10:26.793
so I suggest weekly
iodine baths from today.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.295
- We're on our last barrel.

10:28.295 --> 10:31.632
If we go weekly, we'll be
out of iodine in a month.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.884
(plate clattering)

10:33.884 --> 10:35.552
What's that?

10:37.179 --> 10:38.180
Where's the fish?

10:38.180 --> 10:39.306
- We lost the catch.

10:42.184 --> 10:43.477
- It was right there
on the platform.

10:43.477 --> 10:44.728
- Yeah, and then it wasn't.

10:47.105 --> 10:50.234
- You mean we have to
eat this crap all month?

10:50.234 --> 10:52.861
- The good news is the storm
cycle is getting shorter.

10:54.363 --> 10:55.405
- What happened, Sullivan?

10:55.405 --> 10:56.698
- I take full responsibility.

10:56.698 --> 10:58.033
- And that makes it better how?

10:58.033 --> 10:59.368
- Calm down, Baines.

10:59.368 --> 11:00.994
- We get one chance
to get fresh food,

11:00.994 --> 11:02.329
real fucking food once a month,

11:02.329 --> 11:04.122
all he has to do
is pull up a net.

11:04.122 --> 11:05.832
The storm pushes the
fish into the net.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.501
There's no fishing required.

11:07.501 --> 11:08.627
I mean is it too much to ask?

11:08.627 --> 11:09.920
- You fucked my kitchen.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.588
All right?

11:11.588 --> 11:13.006
So how about you do your
job before giving it all-

11:13.006 --> 11:14.383
- Do my job?

11:14.383 --> 11:16.051
Without my job you'd
have no running water.

11:16.051 --> 11:16.927
I make the fucking water.

11:16.927 --> 11:18.136
Thank you, Baines.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.137
- You make the water.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.222
- Oh, what is it you do again?

11:20.222 --> 11:21.056
Fish?

11:21.056 --> 11:21.890
- Calm down, Baines.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.517
- I do my job, don't I?

11:23.517 --> 11:25.394
I row that deathtrap
into a force nine

11:25.394 --> 11:27.771
to scavenge what I can to keep
this shitcan from collapsing.

11:27.771 --> 11:28.772
- Enough.

11:32.985 --> 11:34.987
I'm still waiting on
that damage report.

11:36.655 --> 11:39.074
- Ah, let me see.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.075
The desalinator?

11:40.075 --> 11:41.118
That's just blew.

11:41.118 --> 11:42.578
The genny is a crock.

11:42.578 --> 11:45.080
Erm, everything
is rusted to shit.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.999
In other words, we're fucked.

11:46.999 --> 11:48.333
Do you want it in French?

11:48.333 --> 11:49.126
Fuckay.

11:49.126 --> 11:50.043
German?

11:50.043 --> 11:50.878
GeFookd.

11:50.878 --> 11:51.670
Spanish?

11:55.799 --> 11:57.467
I don't know it in Spanish.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.678
- I have every confidence
you can fix it all, Baines.

12:02.306 --> 12:05.893
- Ah, okay, I'll
put it this way.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.438
In case you haven't noticed,

12:14.651 --> 12:16.904
we're leaning at a
3.4 degree incline.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.199
And a massive chunk of
the level one walkway

12:20.199 --> 12:21.950
is completely missing.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.368
How do you suggest I fix that?

12:24.661 --> 12:26.455
- Tape it off.

12:26.455 --> 12:28.248
A warning ribbon, yes.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.625
Why didn't I think of that.

12:29.625 --> 12:30.626
- You have a better idea?
- Yeah.

12:30.626 --> 12:32.461
We get the fuck out of here.

12:34.379 --> 12:37.466
When are we going to ask the
Hub when the relief is coming?

12:37.466 --> 12:38.675
- The satellite-

12:38.675 --> 12:39.843
- Is for reporting events only.

12:39.843 --> 12:41.220
Yes, we get that.

12:41.220 --> 12:43.722
- They will inform us
when they're ready.

12:43.722 --> 12:44.806
We all volunteered to be here.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.183
- [Baines] For two years.

12:47.518 --> 12:49.186
Our shift was over
three months ago.

12:55.234 --> 12:58.237
(worrisome music)

13:22.761 --> 13:25.973
- [Computer]
Establishing connection.

13:32.437 --> 13:35.774
(wind funnel flapping)

13:50.873 --> 13:51.874
(computer beeping)

13:51.874 --> 13:54.668
Connection fully established.

13:54.668 --> 13:57.254
(radio static)

13:58.380 --> 14:01.550
(morse code beeping)

14:08.056 --> 14:10.726
(lever tapping)

14:14.354 --> 14:17.232
(worrisome music)

14:27.409 --> 14:31.914
(door clicking)
(door thudding)

14:31.914 --> 14:33.915
- So now, we're not even
allowed to mention it?

14:42.466 --> 14:44.426
Thanks for sticking
by me in the canteen.

14:46.512 --> 14:47.679
- Did I have a choice?

14:54.061 --> 14:57.731
- Oh, I fixed your mug.

14:58.357 --> 14:59.191
- Thanks.

15:02.444 --> 15:07.533
(door creaking)
(door thudding)

15:10.869 --> 15:13.747
(barrel rattling)

15:26.093 --> 15:28.679
(children's music)

15:40.649 --> 15:43.318
(door creaking)

15:56.748 --> 15:58.250
- What are they like, Sarge?

15:59.626 --> 16:02.629
I mean, you've been
behind their lines, right?

16:02.796 --> 16:04.006
Before the great fuck up.

16:08.385 --> 16:09.219
- What's this?

16:11.430 --> 16:13.807
- Oh that?

16:14.600 --> 16:15.392
That's Peter.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.687
- Well, I don't like Peter.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.025
So whoever put him
up can take him down.

16:23.025 --> 16:26.028
- Have a heart, Sarge,
he was lost at sea.

16:26.028 --> 16:28.614
- It's a military outpost
not a damn circus.

16:28.614 --> 16:29.656
- Yeah, once you
get to know him-

16:29.656 --> 16:30.616
- Down.

16:30.616 --> 16:33.035
- He'll be on your conscience.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.119
If he has a conscience.

16:41.710 --> 16:42.586
Yo, Sarge.

16:50.844 --> 16:53.805
Right there.
(anxious music)

16:55.224 --> 16:56.141
You see it?

16:58.560 --> 17:00.562
- Comms, check radar.

17:00.562 --> 17:05.192
Baines, to the roof.
(radio squelching)

17:05.192 --> 17:07.528
Cassidy, do you read?

17:08.529 --> 17:09.530
- I have it.

17:10.571 --> 17:11.990
Solid contact.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.407
Small, slow and steady.

17:13.407 --> 17:14.201
1.9 Ks.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.619
- Yo, it's the boat.

17:16.619 --> 17:18.329
It's the relief.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.705
- Man the gun, Sullivan.

17:19.705 --> 17:22.334
Baines.
(radio squelching)

17:22.334 --> 17:23.961
- The gun?

17:23.961 --> 17:25.420
Sarge, that's the relief.

17:25.420 --> 17:26.463
- We don't know that.

17:27.548 --> 17:28.549
The gun.

17:28.549 --> 17:30.551
Baines, where are you?

17:31.677 --> 17:34.263
(alarm blaring)

17:34.263 --> 17:35.681
♪ E-I-E-I-O ♪

17:35.681 --> 17:39.560
♪ And on that farm
he had a dog ♪

17:39.560 --> 17:40.936
- Sentinel calling vessel.

17:40.936 --> 17:42.271
Identify yourself.

17:42.271 --> 17:44.940

Sentinel to vessel.

Identify yourself.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.461
- What's going on?

18:06.461 --> 18:07.880
- It's our boat.

18:09.256 --> 18:11.425
- [Baines] Fuck, finally.

18:12.509 --> 18:14.052
So what are we doing?

18:14.052 --> 18:16.597
- His stupid protocol.

18:16.597 --> 18:18.432

18:18.432 --> 18:19.808

18:19.808 --> 18:22.352
Radar bearing East

18:24.021 --> 18:24.855
East 85.

18:24.855 --> 18:25.939
No engine reading.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.357
Still steady and slow.

18:27.357 --> 18:28.859
1650 and closing.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.322
Sentinel calling.

Sentinel to vessel,
identify yourself.

18:53.217 --> 18:54.510
Sentinel to vessel.

18:54.510 --> 18:55.302
Respond.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.765

19:01.141 --> 19:02.809
- Sullivan, get the dinghy.

19:04.603 --> 19:05.395
Go see.

19:08.106 --> 19:09.066
Use the outboard.

19:12.653 --> 19:13.445
- Alone?

19:14.488 --> 19:17.157
(tense music)

19:34.675 --> 19:37.427
(engine revving)

19:39.012 --> 19:41.181
- If I say the word,
don't you hesitate.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.475
He'll be as good as ready.

19:44.935 --> 19:47.604
(tense music)

19:55.445 --> 19:58.240
(engine revving)

20:00.742 --> 20:03.412
(waves lapping)

20:14.506 --> 20:16.967
(eerie music)

20:27.352 --> 20:28.312
- Hello.

20:30.647 --> 20:33.400
(uneasy music)

20:46.622 --> 20:49.208
(gun clicking)

21:00.844 --> 21:01.720
(radio squelching)
On deck.

21:02.888 --> 21:03.764
No sign of life.

21:04.806 --> 21:07.809
(radio squelching)

21:09.144 --> 21:12.189
(radio static)
(switch clicking)

21:12.189 --> 21:14.858
(waves lapping)

21:22.449 --> 21:24.993
(uneasy music)

21:32.751 --> 21:33.502
Anyone?

21:46.390 --> 21:48.809
(tense music)

21:50.435 --> 21:51.895
- Sullivan, what's the score?

21:55.399 --> 21:57.150
Sullivan, report.

21:57.150 --> 22:00.946
Over.
(radio squelching)

22:00.946 --> 22:02.155
(door creaking)
- Ahoy.

22:08.537 --> 22:11.331
(uneasy music)

22:30.517 --> 22:33.437
(Peter flapping)

22:34.730 --> 22:39.484
- Sullivan, status, come in?
(radio squelching)

22:39.484 --> 22:42.070
(uneasy music)

22:58.045 --> 23:00.672
(door clicking)

23:04.468 --> 23:06.887
(tense music)

23:27.741 --> 23:30.494
(uneasy music)

23:48.762 --> 23:51.682
(buttons clicking)

23:51.682 --> 23:54.268
(key jingling)

23:57.062 --> 23:58.272
- Isn't that a bit premature?

23:58.272 --> 23:59.982
- Sullivan's not responding.

24:02.734 --> 24:03.819
- Sarge.

24:03.819 --> 24:04.570
- Key.

24:13.787 --> 24:18.750
(key jingling)
(tense music)

24:46.445 --> 24:48.989
(tense music)

24:52.868 --> 24:55.370
(key clicking)

24:55.370 --> 24:58.332
(computer beeping)

25:03.337 --> 25:05.797
(tense music)

25:09.218 --> 25:10.260
- Oh brother.

25:11.386 --> 25:14.473
(tense music)

25:14.473 --> 25:17.142
(door creaking)

25:18.435 --> 25:21.522
(canister rattling)

25:29.029 --> 25:31.740
(uneasy music)

25:36.453 --> 25:39.414
(computer beeping)

25:43.877 --> 25:46.630
(bomb whirring)

25:55.931 --> 25:57.641
(buttons beeping)

25:57.641 --> 25:59.601
- Stand easy, Corporal.

26:04.231 --> 26:07.192
(computer beeping)

26:09.236 --> 26:11.989
(bomb whirring)

26:16.952 --> 26:20.163
Sullivan?
(radio squelching)

26:20.163 --> 26:22.833
(tense music)

26:26.128 --> 26:28.589
Sullivan, imperative
you respond.

26:28.589 --> 26:30.132
(radio squelching)

26:32.885 --> 26:33.677
Sullivan.

26:41.810 --> 26:44.897
(wrapper crackling)

26:53.739 --> 26:55.449
Sullivan, we've gone live.

26:55.449 --> 26:58.035
Repeat, we've gone live.

26:58.035 --> 26:59.578
Imperative-
- No one here.

26:59.578 --> 27:02.539
All clear.
(radio squelching)

27:02.539 --> 27:04.541
(Hendrichs sighing)

27:10.797 --> 27:13.842
- Tow her back.
(radio squelching)

27:13.842 --> 27:17.054
(boat creaking)
(engine revving)

27:17.054 --> 27:19.848
(buttons beeping)

27:20.807 --> 27:23.602
(bomb whirring)

27:31.735 --> 27:33.737
(keys clicking)

27:33.737 --> 27:36.490
(keys jingling)

27:36.490 --> 27:37.282
- Sarge.

27:39.660 --> 27:41.286
My key.

27:41.286 --> 27:43.830
- Upon sighting unknown craft,
the device will be armed.

27:45.249 --> 27:48.919
The protocol is
explicit, Corporal.

27:48.919 --> 27:51.171
Hesitation not permissible.

27:52.130 --> 27:54.675
(uneasy music)

28:16.780 --> 28:19.074
- What the hell's he
thinking, waking Martha?

28:19.074 --> 28:19.950
- What do you expect?

28:19.950 --> 28:22.035
You stopped answering.

28:22.035 --> 28:23.495
- Fucking lunatic.

28:24.663 --> 28:27.249
(fan thudding)

28:36.216 --> 28:38.760
(gentle music)

28:44.266 --> 28:46.977
(door clicking)

28:54.067 --> 28:56.653
(gentle music)

29:03.285 --> 29:06.288
(items clattering)

29:23.138 --> 29:25.766
- [Baines] That
engine's dead, kaput.

29:25.766 --> 29:27.017
- Okay.

29:27.017 --> 29:29.478
What about four kitbags,
two years' supplies

29:29.478 --> 29:32.231
and five barrels of
iodine, it's the relief.

29:32.231 --> 29:33.607
- Well I'm telling you,

29:33.607 --> 29:35.025
that engine hasn't
worked in months.

29:35.025 --> 29:37.069
- What does that mean, huh?

29:37.069 --> 29:38.111
It's just been drifting?

29:39.238 --> 29:40.781
Is that even possible?

29:42.950 --> 29:44.535
And what about the crew?

29:44.535 --> 29:46.620
- Maybe it broke moorings
before they boarded.

29:51.375 --> 29:52.835
- [Sullivan] I guess we'll
find out when we report it.

29:52.835 --> 29:55.128
- There'll be no report
without more information.

29:55.128 --> 29:58.215
(water splattering)

30:01.760 --> 30:03.178
- What kind of information?

30:04.346 --> 30:05.389
- More.

30:05.389 --> 30:06.849
- More?

30:06.849 --> 30:08.392
(chuckles) We know nothing.

30:08.392 --> 30:10.978
Multiply that by 10
and it's still nothing.

30:10.978 --> 30:12.855
Other than blowing
ourselves to kingdom come,

30:12.855 --> 30:15.023
our sole purpose is to
report events, right?

30:16.567 --> 30:19.111
An empty boat turns up
that's meant to be our relief

30:19.111 --> 30:20.404
is that not a fucking event?

30:21.697 --> 30:23.323
And if that's not
a fucking event-

30:23.323 --> 30:25.158
- I'll let you know if there's
a fucking event, Sullivan.

30:30.038 --> 30:34.001
After I've inspected the
vessel and made my assessment.

30:34.001 --> 30:36.879
(keys jingling)

30:36.879 --> 30:38.213
Baines, the boat.

30:38.213 --> 30:40.424
See if you can get some
lights working on her.

30:45.345 --> 30:46.972
- What's he doing
with both keys?

30:50.225 --> 30:51.351
How did that happen?

30:53.770 --> 30:56.523
(uneasy music)

31:12.623 --> 31:15.083
(tense music)

31:31.475 --> 31:33.519
(book cover thudding)

31:39.483 --> 31:41.151
(poster ripping)

31:51.161 --> 31:52.246
You planning a trip?

31:52.246 --> 31:53.747
(computer beeping)

31:53.747 --> 31:57.209
- Establishing connection.
- Going to take that down?

31:57.209 --> 31:59.586
- Yeah, wouldn't
want to miss that.

31:59.586 --> 32:03.340
(computer beeping)

32:03.340 --> 32:05.175
- [Computer] Connection
fully established.

32:05.175 --> 32:08.345
(morse code beeping)

32:11.306 --> 32:13.934
(lever tapping)

32:16.478 --> 32:20.148
Would not wanna miss that.

32:22.776 --> 32:25.362
(uneasy music)

32:28.949 --> 32:30.450
(computer beeping)

32:30.450 --> 32:33.120
- [Computer]
Dropping connection.

32:39.751 --> 32:42.296
(uneasy music)

32:43.505 --> 32:48.552
(metronome ticking)
(tense music)

33:23.754 --> 33:28.884
(metronome ticking)
(tense music)

33:33.138 --> 33:34.306
- [Cassidy] What is it?

33:34.306 --> 33:36.266
- [Sullivan] Beats me.

33:37.518 --> 33:38.310
- Well.

33:39.520 --> 33:41.480
Thanks for the mystery.

33:43.524 --> 33:46.193
(door creaking)

33:59.081 --> 34:02.459
- You ever think about
the world down there?

34:04.503 --> 34:05.462
- [Cassidy] What about it?

34:07.798 --> 34:08.757
- How it was.

34:08.757 --> 34:12.553
People, cities, life.

34:12.553 --> 34:14.304
Before the world was fucked up.

34:14.304 --> 34:15.138
- [Cassidy] It's gone.

34:15.138 --> 34:16.598
Why lose sleep over it?

34:16.598 --> 34:18.391
- [Sullivan] I don't
know, to learn or-

34:18.391 --> 34:19.184
- Learn what?

34:20.518 --> 34:22.312
It's been one fuck
up after another.

34:23.981 --> 34:27.234
One side fucked the climate,
the other side fucked the sea.

34:27.234 --> 34:28.694
When there was nothing
left to fuck up,

34:28.694 --> 34:30.320
we fucked each
other up by fighting

34:30.320 --> 34:31.780
over the nothing that was left.

34:33.282 --> 34:36.869
And then, we inherit this shit.

34:38.495 --> 34:39.288
And what we do?

34:40.873 --> 34:43.041
Keep on fucking up.

34:44.793 --> 34:47.545
- There you go, you
learn something.

34:47.545 --> 34:49.840
- [Cassidy] The only
way to unfuck the world

34:49.840 --> 34:51.592
is to wipe out the humans.

34:51.592 --> 34:53.927
(door creaking)

34:53.927 --> 34:54.719
The watch?

34:59.683 --> 35:03.437
- When we get back, you ever
think about what you'll do?

35:05.981 --> 35:08.692
I was thinking that
when we do get home-

35:08.692 --> 35:12.279
- Sully, (chuckles) come on.

35:12.279 --> 35:15.073
We don't even know when
we're actually going.

35:16.200 --> 35:16.992
You know?

35:18.118 --> 35:20.704
(uneasy music)

35:22.497 --> 35:23.290
- I did it.

35:27.503 --> 35:28.420
I sent a message.

35:32.382 --> 35:33.884
We'll find out tomorrow.

35:36.762 --> 35:39.431
(Peter flapping)

35:42.059 --> 35:44.645
(uneasy music)

36:06.500 --> 36:08.961
(tense music)

36:20.222 --> 36:23.267
(Peter flapping)

36:23.267 --> 36:24.726
(footsteps)

36:41.451 --> 36:43.495
- You angling to send a message?

36:46.915 --> 36:48.041
(computer beeping)

36:48.041 --> 36:49.209
- [Computer]
Establishing connection.

36:50.878 --> 36:52.504
- You did it
already, didn't you?

36:56.300 --> 36:57.176
You did.

36:57.176 --> 36:58.051
Jesus.

36:59.344 --> 37:00.971
- [Hendrichs] Why is
it still up there?

37:05.934 --> 37:07.477
What is this?

37:07.477 --> 37:08.270
A convention?

37:12.191 --> 37:13.692
You taken root, Baines?

37:22.618 --> 37:25.787
- Sullivan sent an
inquiry about the relief.

37:25.787 --> 37:26.914
- Really?

37:26.914 --> 37:29.625
- He would've found out
when the answer comes.

37:29.625 --> 37:32.002
- I told you I wanted
more information first.

37:32.002 --> 37:33.587
- This is the only
information that counts.

37:33.587 --> 37:34.838
(computer beeping)

37:34.838 --> 37:35.839
- [Computer] Connection
fully established.

37:41.720 --> 37:44.806
(morse code beeping)

37:53.941 --> 37:55.359
- That can't be all.

37:55.359 --> 37:56.652
Hold on.

37:56.652 --> 37:57.986
- You sure you sent it?

37:57.986 --> 37:59.738
- Yeah, I'm sure, I'm
not a fucking idiot.

38:03.283 --> 38:06.161
(worrisome music)

38:07.412 --> 38:09.373
- Get to your posts.

38:09.373 --> 38:11.458
I'll deal with you all later.

38:16.922 --> 38:19.883
(morse code beeping)

38:26.181 --> 38:28.141
- Vessel arrived.

38:28.141 --> 38:29.852
Relief missing.

38:31.645 --> 38:32.896
Why are they telling us?

38:34.857 --> 38:40.028
Advise action.

38:40.988 --> 38:43.073
(worrisome music)

38:44.825 --> 38:46.326
Isn't that what you asked them?

38:47.619 --> 38:49.079
- That's exactly
what I asked them.

38:50.163 --> 38:51.623
That's my signal.

38:51.623 --> 38:52.833
(computer beeping)

38:52.833 --> 38:54.710
- [Computer]
Dropping connection.

38:54.710 --> 38:56.044
- [Sullivan] How
is that possible?

38:56.044 --> 38:58.130
- No one downloads it,
so it comes back round.

39:02.426 --> 39:04.553
But why would no
one download it?

39:06.680 --> 39:09.349
- [Computer] Connection dropped.

39:10.726 --> 39:13.979
(uneasy music)

39:13.979 --> 39:16.982
- It could be months, years
since we lost contact.

39:16.982 --> 39:18.734
I mean what genius came
up with this system?

39:18.734 --> 39:20.819
- It must be a faulty
receiver at base.

39:22.487 --> 39:24.448
Maybe it went down yesterday
and tomorrow they'll fix it.

39:24.448 --> 39:26.867
- How do we know
there's been no attack?

39:26.867 --> 39:29.286
- You do know why this
place was built here?

39:29.286 --> 39:30.370
Right here?

39:30.370 --> 39:32.039
- Yeah.

39:32.039 --> 39:33.290
Because back then it was the
only place anyone could cross

39:33.290 --> 39:35.083
in time between the storms.

39:35.083 --> 39:37.252
But that shit was 40 years ago.

39:37.252 --> 39:39.588
I mean, you do realise
that everything's changed?

39:39.588 --> 39:41.215
Tides, currents, jet streams.

39:42.424 --> 39:44.218
That boat just
survived three months.

39:44.218 --> 39:46.428
If the boat can make
it, maybe the enemy can.

39:48.096 --> 39:49.264
And who's to say they haven't?

39:49.264 --> 39:50.349
- Because they haven't.

40:00.317 --> 40:01.109
- I'm sorry.

40:02.194 --> 40:03.320
I'm sure they're fine.

40:04.780 --> 40:07.074
(door creaking)

40:07.074 --> 40:09.243
You're right, it
went down yesterday

40:09.243 --> 40:10.536
and tomorrow they'll fix it.

40:12.829 --> 40:13.622
Fuck.

40:18.877 --> 40:21.505
(uneasy music)

40:28.637 --> 40:31.306
(waves lapping)

40:39.356 --> 40:42.025
(anxious music)

40:57.791 --> 41:00.586
(hatch creaking)

41:06.300 --> 41:09.094
(hatch thudding)

41:20.022 --> 41:22.691
(door creaking)

41:25.194 --> 41:26.153
Yo, Baines?

41:30.908 --> 41:31.658
Baines?

41:37.122 --> 41:39.708
- [Radio Narrator] Out jumped
a strange grinning creature

41:39.708 --> 41:41.084
with a concertina body

41:41.084 --> 41:43.337
and round bald head.

41:44.588 --> 41:45.839
Tin soldier.

41:45.839 --> 41:47.841
The tin soldier
pretended not to hear

41:47.841 --> 41:50.344
but he blushed as
red as his uniform

41:50.344 --> 41:54.431
Staring at our princess. Just
you wait till tomorrow. Haaaaa

41:55.641 --> 41:57.851
And the jack disappeared
back into his box

41:57.851 --> 42:00.562
with a squawking laugh.

42:00.562 --> 42:04.024
The next morning, the little
boy set out his soldiers....

42:07.819 --> 42:11.114
(uneasy music)

42:11.114 --> 42:12.866
(door thudding)

42:12.866 --> 42:18.038
(door creaking)
(door thudding)

42:18.747 --> 42:21.291
(tense music)

42:21.291 --> 42:22.334
- Where've you been?

42:23.669 --> 42:24.503
- Taking a walk.

42:26.046 --> 42:27.548
- With your tools?

42:27.548 --> 42:29.550
- Well if I had a
dog, I'd walk the dog.

42:31.385 --> 42:33.095
(tool bag thudding)

42:33.095 --> 42:33.929
Stay.

42:37.307 --> 42:39.309
- [Sullivan] Any plans
to fix the galley sink?

42:40.435 --> 42:42.437
- Then I wouldn't get to
watch you carrying buckets.

42:44.523 --> 42:45.399
- Fuck you.

42:46.733 --> 42:47.776
With bows on.

42:51.154 --> 42:52.322
Asshole.

42:59.204 --> 43:01.039
- [Baines] Sullivan.

43:05.335 --> 43:08.714
- [Sullivan] Okay, but what
does your Elizabeth say?

43:08.714 --> 43:10.382
- The same.

43:10.382 --> 43:12.259
She never believed
in all that stuff.

43:13.260 --> 43:14.803
About an enemy waiting to cross.

43:17.222 --> 43:18.974
It doesn't make much sense
when you think about it.

43:18.974 --> 43:20.976
I mean we haven't
seen them in 40 years.

43:24.062 --> 43:25.439
They're probably all gone.

43:26.732 --> 43:27.691
- Well why would
they send us here

43:27.691 --> 43:29.026
if there's no one out there?

43:29.026 --> 43:33.197
- It's the threat, Liz
says they use the threat

43:33.197 --> 43:35.532
of danger to keep us in line.

43:37.242 --> 43:38.785
- They used to be there.

43:38.785 --> 43:39.745
- Yeah, they did.

43:41.872 --> 43:44.208
She says we wiped
them out years ago.

43:46.627 --> 43:48.045
Or the sea done it for us.

43:50.923 --> 43:52.466
- She says a lot your old lady.

43:53.717 --> 43:54.760
- (chuckles) Yeah.

43:57.471 --> 43:58.514
She's pretty smart.

44:07.397 --> 44:09.066
- What if they
think we detonated?

44:10.567 --> 44:11.902
- They don't.

44:11.902 --> 44:13.111
- No, if the satellite is bust

44:13.111 --> 44:14.571
and they aint
getting our messages-

44:14.571 --> 44:16.240
- Martha is 20 megatons.

44:16.240 --> 44:18.575
The tsunami she kicks up
would hit both continents.

44:18.575 --> 44:19.910
More than hit.

44:19.910 --> 44:20.702
Smash.

44:22.204 --> 44:23.372
- Wait, wait.

44:24.957 --> 44:27.209
Martha's tiny compared
to the first two-

44:27.209 --> 44:28.669
- It doesn't need to be big.

44:30.671 --> 44:32.923
The earth's a
different place now.

44:32.923 --> 44:35.843
The axis has shifted,
the sea's risen.

44:35.843 --> 44:36.969
It wouldn't take much.

44:39.137 --> 44:43.600
- So it could
actually destroy us

44:44.726 --> 44:49.606
and horses, and dogs-

44:49.606 --> 44:50.607
- And cats.

44:50.607 --> 44:51.358
- Cats.

44:53.610 --> 44:55.445
And swallows?

44:55.445 --> 44:56.363
- Sully.
- I mean,

44:56.363 --> 45:00.075
sweet swooping swallows.

45:00.075 --> 45:01.076
- Listen.

45:01.076 --> 45:02.744
- Man they don't deserve that.

45:02.744 --> 45:04.913
I mean haven't we screwed
up enough already?

45:04.913 --> 45:07.291
- Sully.
- And he got both keys.

45:07.291 --> 45:08.417
- Can we just stop
talking about this now.

45:08.417 --> 45:10.919
- To the last
device in the world.

45:10.919 --> 45:12.254
- Sully, listen to me.

45:12.254 --> 45:13.088
Listen to me.

45:15.340 --> 45:19.136
What if, hypothetically,

45:21.889 --> 45:23.015
that boat could work?

45:31.398 --> 45:32.608
- (gasps) Jesus, Sully.

45:35.485 --> 45:38.488
- Ever heard of Mornington?

45:40.908 --> 45:42.117
- Who?

45:42.117 --> 45:44.077
- No, no, a place.

45:44.077 --> 45:46.914
They've still got
electrics, running water,

45:46.914 --> 45:49.082
even a sewage plant.

45:49.082 --> 45:50.250
- Mornington.
- Yeah.

45:50.250 --> 45:51.585
- Great.

45:51.585 --> 45:52.211
Let's talk about
it in the morning.

45:52.211 --> 45:53.545
I need sleep.

45:53.545 --> 45:55.964
- What if I told you
that the boat worked?

46:04.473 --> 46:08.727
I mean, the boat
could still work.

46:13.690 --> 46:15.275
- Baines is fixing it?

46:15.275 --> 46:19.154
- Well, if he asks, I
ain't tell you shit.

46:21.156 --> 46:22.407
- Has he done it or not?

46:22.407 --> 46:24.284
- I mean, it's a
work in progress.

46:26.703 --> 46:29.748
We have to leave within
the next three days.

46:29.748 --> 46:33.210
That'll give us 14
days to get home

46:33.210 --> 46:35.796
before the next storm hits.

46:35.796 --> 46:38.966
So all we need to do
is convince Hendrichs.

46:40.092 --> 46:42.219
I mean we're going home, Cass.

46:42.219 --> 46:43.762
- Hendrichs will
never go for this.

46:43.762 --> 46:46.265
- Hendrichs can come
or stay, his call.

46:48.684 --> 46:50.143
But we are going.

46:52.729 --> 46:55.190
I mean, a couple
of weeks from now

46:55.190 --> 46:57.192
we'll be sat in that
great stinking port,

46:57.192 --> 46:58.235
eating goat steak.

47:00.320 --> 47:03.073
I mean, what do you say to that?

47:05.742 --> 47:08.328
(waves lapping)

47:32.394 --> 47:35.689
- On my signal, not
before, not after.

47:35.689 --> 47:37.357
Or you'll have my
hand off, okay?

47:39.776 --> 47:40.569
You ready?

47:42.905 --> 47:43.697
Three.

47:45.324 --> 47:46.116
Two.

47:48.327 --> 47:49.828
Now.

47:49.828 --> 47:53.248
(engine splatting)

47:53.248 --> 47:55.167
Again.

47:55.167 --> 47:58.212
(engine rumbling)

48:00.756 --> 48:03.842
(Sullivan cheering)

48:11.099 --> 48:11.892
Now.

48:14.561 --> 48:15.354
Hendrichs.

48:17.481 --> 48:20.484
- You just leave
the talking to me.

48:21.944 --> 48:25.030
(Sullivan laughing)

48:29.868 --> 48:30.911
- Excellent work.

48:33.997 --> 48:36.750
- Well, what can we say.

48:39.086 --> 48:40.045
- Now, break it up.

48:42.297 --> 48:44.466
I want everything
stripped by sundown.

48:44.466 --> 48:47.761
Electrics, engine, nuts
and bolts, decking.

48:47.761 --> 48:49.805
Everything that's not hull.

48:49.805 --> 48:51.056
Start with the engine.

48:51.056 --> 48:52.307
- No fucking way.

48:52.307 --> 48:53.684
- Look, it's a
working boat, Sarge.

48:53.684 --> 48:55.018
- We need the parts.

48:55.018 --> 48:57.229
- Sarge, that fuel
injector is held together

48:57.229 --> 48:59.606
by quarter mil copper wire,
if it's moved one inch-

48:59.606 --> 49:01.942
- The engine is not the point.

49:01.942 --> 49:03.819
We only have one chance.

49:03.819 --> 49:06.530
If we leave by tomorrow,
we beat the storm.

49:06.530 --> 49:08.949
If not, then we lose
the boat for good.

49:08.949 --> 49:11.285
- That's why we're
dismantling her.

49:15.914 --> 49:17.332
- I vote we go.

49:20.377 --> 49:22.588
- You don't get
to vote, Sullivan.

49:24.882 --> 49:25.674
- Baines?

49:29.344 --> 49:30.137
Cassidy?

49:31.889 --> 49:34.558
(tense music)

49:40.439 --> 49:41.690
We're not dying for you.

49:43.192 --> 49:44.109
Not like the others.

49:53.744 --> 49:54.578
- New orders.

49:56.121 --> 49:56.997
Cassidy, Comms.

49:58.540 --> 49:59.666
Sullivan, winch.

50:00.876 --> 50:02.753
Baines, stow the salvage.

50:05.339 --> 50:07.966
- Or what?

50:07.966 --> 50:10.636
(anxious music)

50:15.599 --> 50:16.975
- Fuck.

50:16.975 --> 50:18.268
- You have the amazing ability

50:18.268 --> 50:19.645
of saying the wrong
thing at the wrong time.

50:19.645 --> 50:21.396
What do you expect?

50:21.396 --> 50:24.233
- Fuck him, we'll
take it anyway.

50:24.233 --> 50:25.984
- [Hendrichs] Sullivan,
where are you?

50:25.984 --> 50:28.070
Man the winch.

50:28.070 --> 50:30.072
- That's our boat and
we're not losing it.

50:30.072 --> 50:32.366
Not to that power-crazy-
- It's not about power.

50:32.366 --> 50:33.367
- He took both keys.

50:37.871 --> 50:39.665
- [Hendrichs] What's
taking so long?

50:44.253 --> 50:45.254
- I'll deal with it.

50:46.338 --> 50:48.799
(tense music)

50:53.303 --> 50:55.973
(door thudding)

51:08.110 --> 51:08.902
- Did you know?

51:11.572 --> 51:12.906
- Hypothetically.

51:12.906 --> 51:15.367
- Your duty is to
inform me of mutiny.

51:15.367 --> 51:17.536
- Come on, Sarge,
it's not a mutiny.

51:17.536 --> 51:19.580
They need to understand
their orders.

51:19.580 --> 51:21.874
Can you honestly say you stopped
them for the right reason?

51:21.874 --> 51:25.169
- Our job is to protect the
device, not run like rats.

51:26.336 --> 51:27.629
Right reason enough for you?

51:31.717 --> 51:33.218
Make yourself useful.

51:33.218 --> 51:35.387
Clear out the wheelhouse.

51:43.979 --> 51:45.564
- I'm sorry you lost
your squad, Sergeant.

51:45.564 --> 51:47.816
- What's that got
to do with anything?

51:50.861 --> 51:53.030
- Those other men
aren't ever coming back.

51:59.244 --> 52:00.245
Don't lose two more.

52:01.997 --> 52:03.540
- [Sullivan] We're
not killing anyone.

52:03.540 --> 52:05.375
- Did I say kill?

52:05.375 --> 52:06.835
We jump.

52:06.835 --> 52:07.628
We jump him.

52:08.921 --> 52:10.422
We need to leave
here by tomorrow.

52:12.758 --> 52:15.761
So unless you have something
better to do, like talk

52:15.761 --> 52:18.805
or vote, he could just
walk in here and shoot us.

52:21.141 --> 52:23.060
- Would you be able
to disable Martha?

52:24.978 --> 52:27.689
- (chuckles) Jesus,
he's not going to-

52:27.689 --> 52:29.816
- There's no telling what
crazy shit he might do.

52:34.530 --> 52:35.364
- I don't know.

52:35.364 --> 52:36.156
It would take...

52:37.366 --> 52:39.034
What are we even talking about?

52:39.034 --> 52:40.410
Are you listening to me?

52:40.410 --> 52:42.246
We need to be out
of here tomorrow.

52:42.246 --> 52:44.122
If we don't leave
by tomorrow he...

52:44.122 --> 52:45.457
(footsteps)

52:52.422 --> 52:53.799
- Drinking on duty, Baines?

52:56.802 --> 52:58.178
- No, it's not even open.

53:00.222 --> 53:02.766
- In that case, at
least you could share.

53:02.766 --> 53:03.725
Get some glasses.

53:36.758 --> 53:40.220
Corporal Cassidy
deems it imperative
to send a report home.

53:42.097 --> 53:42.890
By boat.

53:45.225 --> 53:50.105
I am minded to agree.

53:55.360 --> 54:00.532
That said, it goes
without saying we
can't abandon our post.

54:03.243 --> 54:07.831
So, we split up.

54:08.957 --> 54:12.669
Two go and one stays with me.

54:15.589 --> 54:16.965
- Who?

54:16.965 --> 54:20.385
- The boat will deliver
our report to the Hub

54:20.385 --> 54:23.847
and send back the
relief or else return

54:23.847 --> 54:25.015
with information and supplies.

54:25.015 --> 54:27.142
- Yeah, who?

54:27.142 --> 54:29.478
Who goes, who stays with you?

54:32.481 --> 54:35.859
- Corporal Cassidy
volunteered to remain.

54:40.280 --> 54:41.740
You pack two weeks' supplies.

54:43.408 --> 54:46.495
You leave tomorrow if
there's no new signal.

54:47.496 --> 54:50.374
(worrisome music)

54:59.216 --> 54:59.967
- [Sullivan] What was that?

55:04.721 --> 55:05.514
Cass?

55:10.894 --> 55:12.062
You said you'd talk to him.

55:12.062 --> 55:13.272
- I did.

55:13.272 --> 55:14.940
You got what you wanted.

55:14.940 --> 55:16.900
Take the boat, go home.

55:18.193 --> 55:19.987
- You can't stay
here alone with him.

55:19.987 --> 55:23.156
- The rig needs at least
two to keep it running.

55:23.156 --> 55:24.741
- I'm not leaving without you.

55:26.827 --> 55:29.663
What is it?

55:29.663 --> 55:30.831
You've been on edge for months.

55:30.831 --> 55:32.165
- We're soldiers.

55:32.165 --> 55:34.960
- Stop being a fucking
soldier for one minute.

55:34.960 --> 55:37.171
- (sighs) Why are
you here, Sullivan?

55:37.171 --> 55:38.005
- [Sullivan] What?

55:38.005 --> 55:39.756
- Here, on this post.

55:39.756 --> 55:40.591
You volunteered.

55:40.591 --> 55:42.092
- Oh come on.

55:42.092 --> 55:44.928
Don't make like this is
some heroic national duty.

55:44.928 --> 55:46.096
Truth, loyalty, sacrifice.

55:46.096 --> 55:48.098
That shit belongs
on the toilet wall.

55:48.098 --> 55:50.475
We didn't come here to die.

55:50.475 --> 55:52.269
We came for the cash.

55:52.269 --> 55:55.314
And we signed up to put our
lives on the line for two years.

55:55.314 --> 55:56.523
Two.

55:56.523 --> 55:58.275
And we kept our side.

56:05.365 --> 56:06.158
I'll stay.

56:08.952 --> 56:09.995
You go.

56:09.995 --> 56:10.787
- You don't get a say.

56:12.080 --> 56:13.081
- [Sullivan] I'm not
leaving you here.

56:15.501 --> 56:18.629
- Sully, whatever
you think you feel-

56:18.629 --> 56:20.797
- Whatever I think I feel?

56:24.301 --> 56:26.220
I won't let you-
- Go pack.

56:26.220 --> 56:27.429
Jesus.

56:32.976 --> 56:34.353
- Don't you wanna go home?

56:36.063 --> 56:36.855
You.

56:39.066 --> 56:40.192
Don't you wanna see them?

56:45.405 --> 56:46.990
I know you wanna go back.

56:48.492 --> 56:49.284
You must.

56:50.410 --> 56:52.996
(gentle music)

57:01.255 --> 57:02.297
Then let's both stay.

57:09.972 --> 57:11.515
- I don't love you, Sullivan.

57:14.226 --> 57:15.727
If that's what you wanna hear.

57:19.231 --> 57:20.691
You were a human necessity.

57:23.527 --> 57:24.319
An easy lay.

57:25.988 --> 57:28.532
(tender music)

57:47.843 --> 57:52.681
(hand thudding)
(door creaking)

57:52.681 --> 57:55.350
(hand thudding)

57:57.895 --> 58:00.772
(Cassidy sobbing)

58:55.994 --> 58:57.621
- They're like us.

59:01.250 --> 59:03.001
You asked me what they are like.

59:05.963 --> 59:09.007
They have families and
children, they eat and shit,

59:10.342 --> 59:13.095
and they pray one day
all this will end.

59:14.763 --> 59:16.807
The only difference
between us and them

59:16.807 --> 59:22.271
is they're trying to kill us
and we're trying to kill them.

59:23.188 --> 59:24.773
And that's not
even a difference.

59:28.318 --> 59:30.112
- We could all go, Sarge.

59:32.531 --> 59:33.365
No one's coming.

59:34.783 --> 59:36.535
Not ours or theirs.

59:36.535 --> 59:37.786
- We can't know that.

59:39.329 --> 59:42.541
We have something
they don't, Sullivan.

59:42.541 --> 59:44.751
Our duty is to keep it that way.

59:54.178 --> 59:56.054
I'm sorry you have
to leave Cassidy.

1:00:05.814 --> 1:00:08.358
- [Sullivan] You knew?

1:00:08.358 --> 1:00:11.028
- I know everything, Sullivan.

1:00:12.404 --> 1:00:15.532
Rest up, both of you.

1:00:28.045 --> 1:00:30.714
(tense music)

1:01:19.137 --> 1:01:21.598
(tense music)

1:01:45.706 --> 1:01:48.166
- Is everything okay, Sarge?

1:01:50.419 --> 1:01:53.297
(anxious music)

1:02:11.356 --> 1:02:14.026
(alarm blaring)

1:02:19.198 --> 1:02:20.532
- Oh sweet Jesus.

1:02:27.998 --> 1:02:30.918
(radar beeping)

1:02:30.918 --> 1:02:33.378
(tense music)

1:02:35.255 --> 1:02:36.673
- Action stations.

1:02:38.800 --> 1:02:43.972
(alarm blaring)
(door thudding)

1:02:43.972 --> 1:02:45.057
Man the gun.

1:02:47.768 --> 1:02:48.894
- How far are they?

1:02:48.894 --> 1:02:50.437
Maybe we can outrun
them in the boat.

1:02:50.437 --> 1:02:55.234
- [Hendrichs] Left four degrees,
600 metres, bearing 186.

1:02:55.234 --> 1:02:56.568
- 600.

1:02:56.568 --> 1:02:57.986
Shit, I can't see a thing.

1:02:59.238 --> 1:03:00.781
Cass, what you got?

1:03:04.159 --> 1:03:05.369
- Sentinel calling vessel.

1:03:06.620 --> 1:03:11.792
(radar beeping)
(tense music)

1:03:15.379 --> 1:03:19.007
- [Baines] How'd it get so
near with no-one picking it up?

1:03:19.007 --> 1:03:21.009
- [Hendrichs] Right
one, hold elevation.

1:03:24.847 --> 1:03:25.764
(shell clattering)

1:03:25.764 --> 1:03:27.266
Elevation three.

1:03:27.266 --> 1:03:28.016
Ready.

1:03:30.352 --> 1:03:32.437
- Should we find out who they
are before firing, Sarge?

1:03:32.437 --> 1:03:33.272
- Not this time.

1:03:34.940 --> 1:03:36.483
Fire.

1:03:36.483 --> 1:03:39.194
(cannon booming)

1:03:44.575 --> 1:03:45.325
Miss.

1:03:46.785 --> 1:03:48.453
Reload.
- Fuck.

1:03:48.453 --> 1:03:49.288
- Repeat.

1:03:49.288 --> 1:03:50.873
Sentinel calling vessel.

1:03:50.873 --> 1:03:51.665
Respond

1:03:57.629 --> 1:04:00.507
(radar beeping)

1:04:03.677 --> 1:04:07.097
(tense music)

1:04:07.097 --> 1:04:09.349
- [Hendrichs] Left two, up one.

1:04:09.349 --> 1:04:10.309
- Up?

1:04:10.309 --> 1:04:11.768
It's heading away?

1:04:15.397 --> 1:04:17.107
- Fuck.

1:04:17.107 --> 1:04:19.568
(tense music)

1:04:28.243 --> 1:04:29.703
It's our boat.

1:04:29.703 --> 1:04:31.121
- Fire.
- It's our boat.

1:04:31.121 --> 1:04:32.247
- Take your post.

1:04:33.540 --> 1:04:34.291
Fire

1:04:35.876 --> 1:04:38.003
Fire, Baines, fire.

1:04:38.003 --> 1:04:38.754
- Our boat?

1:04:40.589 --> 1:04:42.674
Quick, grab the tender.

1:04:42.674 --> 1:04:45.302
(tense music)

1:04:52.601 --> 1:04:55.020
Hendrichs, are you
fucking insane?

1:04:55.020 --> 1:05:00.192
(fist thumping)
(Baines grunting)

1:05:01.151 --> 1:05:02.361
- Sarge, the boat.

1:05:02.361 --> 1:05:04.988
- Time to choose
sides, corporal.

1:05:05.489 --> 1:05:08.158
(tense music)

1:05:13.372 --> 1:05:15.457
Right one, hold elevation.

1:05:16.124 --> 1:05:18.794
(tense music)

1:05:22.714 --> 1:05:24.174
- Do it, Baines.

1:05:25.384 --> 1:05:28.053
(gun booming)

1:05:31.265 --> 1:05:33.725
(tense music)

1:05:37.729 --> 1:05:39.398
- Don't you touch that, Sully.

1:05:39.398 --> 1:05:41.233
- Move away, Sullivan.

1:05:42.693 --> 1:05:45.028
Baines, take your post.

1:05:45.028 --> 1:05:46.154
Fire on my command.

1:05:50.993 --> 1:05:52.578
(gun booming)

1:05:52.786 --> 1:05:54.204
Step back.

1:06:03.714 --> 1:06:05.757
Last chance, Baines.

1:06:05.757 --> 1:06:08.093
Fire now, or I will.

1:06:08.468 --> 1:06:10.971
(tense music)

1:06:18.353 --> 1:06:21.356
(cannon booming)

1:06:39.499 --> 1:06:42.252
(anxious music)

1:06:57.601 --> 1:06:58.393
Baines.

1:06:59.937 --> 1:07:02.022
(fire hydrant thumping)

1:07:09.238 --> 1:07:11.698
(tense music)

1:07:30.467 --> 1:07:33.345
(keys jingling)

1:07:42.229 --> 1:07:45.315
(downhearted music)

1:07:49.570 --> 1:07:52.239
(keys jingling)

1:07:54.575 --> 1:07:55.701
- Are you all right?

1:07:55.701 --> 1:07:56.535
- Where is he?

1:07:56.535 --> 1:07:57.578
- Store room.

1:07:57.578 --> 1:07:58.370
- I'm gonna kill him.

1:07:58.370 --> 1:07:59.329
- Wait, stop.

1:07:59.329 --> 1:08:01.832
No, hey, Baines, no no no.

1:08:01.832 --> 1:08:03.375
(body thumping)
Hey, no.

1:08:03.375 --> 1:08:05.169
- Hey, hey.

1:08:05.169 --> 1:08:08.005
(fist thumping)

1:08:08.005 --> 1:08:11.091
(downhearted music)

1:08:15.679 --> 1:08:18.014
- You're okay, you're fine.

1:08:31.319 --> 1:08:34.865
Shit.
(sorrowful music)

1:09:32.714 --> 1:09:35.050
(Baines sobbing)

1:09:35.050 --> 1:09:38.136
(downhearted music)

1:09:59.282 --> 1:10:01.618
(radio static)

1:10:01.618 --> 1:10:04.496
- [Computer]
Dropping connection.

1:10:14.339 --> 1:10:19.094
(computer beeping)
Connection dropped.

1:10:25.726 --> 1:10:28.603
- And we need to move from
staggered six hour shifts

1:10:28.603 --> 1:10:31.732
to eight hours, with
two on and one off.

1:10:32.816 --> 1:10:35.903
Until Hendrichs is-
- We're not letting him out.

1:10:37.779 --> 1:10:39.114
- [Cassidy] He needs
the iodine bath.

1:10:39.114 --> 1:10:42.409
- We are not letting him out.

1:10:47.289 --> 1:10:48.040
- Okay.

1:10:49.416 --> 1:10:52.002
And-
- And I quit.

1:10:59.760 --> 1:11:02.596
(bottle thudding)

1:11:02.596 --> 1:11:05.599
- I guess that means 12 hour
shifts with one on and one off.

1:11:07.518 --> 1:11:09.436
We try to contact home.

1:11:10.020 --> 1:11:12.481
Maybe it's only
625 that's blocked.

1:11:12.481 --> 1:11:14.441
We'll give the
other channels a go.

1:11:14.441 --> 1:11:17.568
One a day, starting at 001.

1:11:17.568 --> 1:11:19.737
- There's a thousand channels,
we'll be at it three years.

1:11:19.737 --> 1:11:21.448
- We're not exactly
going anywhere.

1:11:28.455 --> 1:11:33.544
- Sully, those things I said,

1:11:38.048 --> 1:11:40.550
I really wanted you
to go on the boat.

1:11:43.136 --> 1:11:45.472
To get home safe.

1:11:49.226 --> 1:11:51.061
Don't punish me for that.

1:12:04.825 --> 1:12:07.702
(fork clattering)

1:12:18.839 --> 1:12:21.842
(plate clattering)

1:12:25.179 --> 1:12:25.971
- Why?

1:12:29.099 --> 1:12:30.893
Why change your
mind about us going?

1:12:32.603 --> 1:12:35.189
- I'm here for the same
reasons you are, Sullivan.

1:12:35.189 --> 1:12:36.481
- Cash?

1:12:36.481 --> 1:12:38.775
- We both know you won't
be seeing any money.

1:12:40.152 --> 1:12:41.486
You traded four years in the can

1:12:41.486 --> 1:12:43.280
for two years in this place.

1:12:44.990 --> 1:12:45.949
That was your deal.

1:12:50.077 --> 1:12:52.789
And I'm here because
it's the only command

1:12:52.789 --> 1:12:54.499
they would give me.

1:12:54.499 --> 1:12:58.587
We're both here to atone our
sins, and earn a second chance.

1:13:04.968 --> 1:13:06.344
- Enjoy your meal.

1:13:06.344 --> 1:13:09.139
- The boat was here
three months ago.

1:13:11.391 --> 1:13:15.728
I recreated the
route from the e-log.

1:13:18.232 --> 1:13:23.403
They got to 10 miles due east,
changed course, away from us.

1:13:24.237 --> 1:13:26.198
The engine stopped
five miles north.

1:13:26.823 --> 1:13:28.742
After that, they were drifting.

1:13:29.618 --> 1:13:31.577
(anxious music)

1:13:31.577 --> 1:13:34.081
There are two questions now.

1:13:34.206 --> 1:13:38.001
Why didn't we see it, and why
did the boat change course

1:13:38.001 --> 1:13:42.005
if all they had to do
was follow our beacon.

1:13:42.005 --> 1:13:43.799
(tense music)

1:13:43.799 --> 1:13:44.842
- What the fuck are
you talking about?

1:13:47.969 --> 1:13:52.139
- Here we are, and
here they come.

1:13:54.226 --> 1:13:57.437
4.38 they start to change course

1:13:57.437 --> 1:14:00.190
and half an hour
later they stop here.

1:14:02.568 --> 1:14:03.986
It's a curve.

1:14:03.986 --> 1:14:05.529
A curve, you understand?

1:14:06.864 --> 1:14:08.156
- No.

1:14:08.156 --> 1:14:10.409
- It means they didn't
change course once,

1:14:10.409 --> 1:14:11.994
they kept changing.

1:14:12.786 --> 1:14:14.413
And then they stopped here.

1:14:15.246 --> 1:14:16.623
Why stop?

1:14:18.959 --> 1:14:21.295
Unless they thought
they'd arrived.

1:14:22.504 --> 1:14:24.882
(tense music)

1:14:25.090 --> 1:14:26.758
- Why didn't you
tell us last night?

1:14:28.719 --> 1:14:29.761
Why blow up the boat?

1:14:32.931 --> 1:14:34.057
Why didn't you tell us?

1:14:38.478 --> 1:14:40.189
Unless this is what you wanted?

1:14:42.023 --> 1:14:43.734
To keep us here.

1:14:43.734 --> 1:14:45.736
(knife clicking)

1:14:45.736 --> 1:14:48.864
Because you think one of us
has something to do with it?

1:14:48.864 --> 1:14:51.241
- Whatever happens Sullivan
we have to make sure

1:14:51.241 --> 1:14:53.660
that they won't get their
hands on the device.

1:14:55.704 --> 1:14:57.121
You have to get me out, Sully.

1:14:59.291 --> 1:15:02.252
- That was a hell of a blow
you took to the head, Sarge.

1:15:03.962 --> 1:15:06.380
(tense music)

1:15:07.716 --> 1:15:10.552
- Sully, you have to get me out.

1:15:11.762 --> 1:15:14.389
(door thudding)

1:15:14.389 --> 1:15:17.059
(beacon buzzing)

1:15:20.103 --> 1:15:23.106
(morse code beeping)

1:15:27.861 --> 1:15:30.531
(lever tapping)

1:15:34.576 --> 1:15:35.786
(computer beeping)

1:15:35.786 --> 1:15:38.705
- [Computer]
Dropping connection.

1:15:45.712 --> 1:15:48.715
(bottles clinking)

1:15:55.973 --> 1:16:00.853
Connection dropped.
(computer beeping)

1:16:00.853 --> 1:16:04.481
(children's music)

1:16:22.875 --> 1:16:25.544
(tense music)

1:16:28.922 --> 1:16:32.509
(fist thumping)

1:16:32.509 --> 1:16:35.012
(tense music)

1:17:22.434 --> 1:17:25.062
(gentle music)

1:17:28.607 --> 1:17:30.108
- You look happy.

1:17:32.611 --> 1:17:33.820
- That's not me.

1:17:37.741 --> 1:17:40.410
I'm the grumpy girl there.

1:17:44.039 --> 1:17:47.751
That's my brother and
those are my parents.

1:17:51.839 --> 1:17:56.175
One day a photographer was
coming to our local pier.

1:17:58.094 --> 1:18:02.266
Taking photos for
cash or exchange.

1:18:04.809 --> 1:18:05.727
It was raining.

1:18:07.855 --> 1:18:11.608
I wanted the bigger
umbrella that my brother had

1:18:14.193 --> 1:18:16.487
and those little blue boots.

1:18:18.699 --> 1:18:25.163
So, here I am protesting
the unfairness of it all.

1:18:29.168 --> 1:18:31.460
And this is the only
photo of us ever taken.

1:18:36.633 --> 1:18:40.137
The next year I was
sent away to school.

1:18:41.346 --> 1:18:42.639
And there was an enemy raid.

1:18:45.767 --> 1:18:46.977
And they were all killed.

1:18:49.021 --> 1:18:51.607
(gentle music)

1:18:54.985 --> 1:18:58.030
- [Sullivan] All I
remember from my childhood

1:18:58.030 --> 1:18:59.823
was the constant heat.

1:19:01.450 --> 1:19:02.367
Never rain.

1:19:06.038 --> 1:19:09.666
There are a lot of
things I don't remember.

1:19:14.796 --> 1:19:17.466
(anxious music)

1:19:22.387 --> 1:19:25.264
(waves lapping)

1:19:47.329 --> 1:19:50.332
(switch clicking)

1:20:05.264 --> 1:20:08.267
(rain splattering)

1:20:19.443 --> 1:20:22.114
(door thudding)

1:20:28.912 --> 1:20:32.040
(generator chugging)

1:20:38.505 --> 1:20:41.383
(radar beeping)

1:20:48.849 --> 1:20:49.766
- Jesus.

1:21:05.532 --> 1:21:08.285
(rain pattering)

1:21:15.918 --> 1:21:17.002
Are you okay?

1:21:19.087 --> 1:21:20.297
(tense music)

1:21:20.380 --> 1:21:24.425
- Together we seek better

1:21:25.636 --> 1:21:27.846
and more sustainable
ways forward.

1:21:28.972 --> 1:21:29.932
- What?

1:21:29.932 --> 1:21:31.266
How much have you had to drink?

1:21:31.266 --> 1:21:36.146
- This is a promise
we give to our future.

1:21:37.105 --> 1:21:38.690
- Baines, what are you...

1:22:01.922 --> 1:22:07.094
(Cassidy thudding)
(Cassidy groaning)

1:22:10.722 --> 1:22:12.683
- Get off me.

1:22:12.683 --> 1:22:13.475
Get off.

1:22:15.853 --> 1:22:20.898
(elbow thumping)
(Baines groaning)

1:22:20.898 --> 1:22:22.484
What the fuck.

1:22:22.484 --> 1:22:24.193
What the fuck, Baines.

1:22:24.987 --> 1:22:25.737
Sober up.

1:22:26.864 --> 1:22:29.532
(anxious music)

1:22:32.369 --> 1:22:33.579
(door thudding)

1:22:33.579 --> 1:22:36.415
Sully, it's Baines,
he's lost it.

1:22:37.583 --> 1:22:39.251
- You all right?

1:22:39.251 --> 1:22:41.837
- [Baines] We reach towards
the summit of possibility

1:22:41.837 --> 1:22:46.675
to make the best for the
most using the least.

1:22:46.842 --> 1:22:49.094
- He just needs
to sober up, okay?

1:22:49.094 --> 1:22:52.556
- [Baines] With purity of
form and clarity of purpose

1:22:53.432 --> 1:22:58.103
being constant in our ideals
and trustful in our mission.

1:22:58.103 --> 1:22:59.353
- No.

1:22:59.353 --> 1:23:01.690
- Were making elegance
meet innovation

1:23:01.690 --> 1:23:06.862
and simplicity from
this day until the last.

1:23:07.654 --> 1:23:09.698
(tense music)

1:23:18.749 --> 1:23:20.751
This is our vision.

1:23:22.628 --> 1:23:25.714
Simple, stylish, comfortable,

1:23:27.549 --> 1:23:30.969
elegant, innovative.

1:23:34.097 --> 1:23:36.892
(button beeping)

1:23:39.353 --> 1:23:42.814
Teamwork is the essence
of the BORG culture.

1:23:44.483 --> 1:23:48.403
Together, creative, hopeful,

1:23:49.905 --> 1:23:51.240
we share a common goal.

1:23:53.157 --> 1:23:55.202
- This is not a
common goal, buddy.

1:23:55.202 --> 1:23:57.704
- Can you imagine how many
shades of fabric they have?

1:24:01.083 --> 1:24:01.875
27.

1:24:04.795 --> 1:24:06.255
Do you know who started it?

1:24:07.798 --> 1:24:09.216
Mart.

1:24:09.216 --> 1:24:10.092
In Estonia.

1:24:13.804 --> 1:24:14.680
It was a country.

1:24:17.975 --> 1:24:20.018
A small country.

1:24:20.018 --> 1:24:22.563
There were a lot of them.
- Yeah.

1:24:22.563 --> 1:24:24.189
- [Baines] Big and small.

1:24:24.189 --> 1:24:26.358
- That's good to know, pal.

1:24:29.318 --> 1:24:30.320
- Baines.

1:24:30.320 --> 1:24:31.405
- You don't care about history.

1:24:31.405 --> 1:24:32.906
- I do, Baines.

1:24:32.906 --> 1:24:35.909
Me and Cass, we were just
talking about that earlier.

1:24:35.909 --> 1:24:38.452
But let's not make
history today, hmm?

1:24:41.790 --> 1:24:43.250
(button beeping)
Wait, wait wait.

1:24:43.250 --> 1:24:44.459
Listen, listen Baines.

1:24:46.253 --> 1:24:47.296
This is no way to go.

1:24:50.215 --> 1:24:51.383
What about Liz, hmm?

1:24:53.050 --> 1:24:57.389
Of all the dumb ways to go,
what would Liz say to this?

1:24:57.389 --> 1:24:58.849
Let's leave Martha alone.

1:25:00.309 --> 1:25:03.728
Hey man, we all deserve better.

1:25:03.728 --> 1:25:07.316
(Baines laughing)

1:25:07.316 --> 1:25:09.985
(tense music)

1:25:18.577 --> 1:25:19.536
- Baines.

1:25:29.087 --> 1:25:30.047
- Okay, man.

1:25:31.590 --> 1:25:32.341
Hey.

1:25:34.259 --> 1:25:36.469
Hey, it's okay.

1:25:36.469 --> 1:25:39.223
(Baines sobbing)

1:25:41.767 --> 1:25:44.937
Hey, hey, Baines,
man, it's all right.

1:25:44.937 --> 1:25:47.564
It's okay.
(buttons clicking)

1:25:47.564 --> 1:25:50.234
(keys jingling)

1:25:53.403 --> 1:25:58.116
- (chuckles) I forgot
the last number.

1:25:59.535 --> 1:26:02.412
(Baines laughing)

1:26:03.664 --> 1:26:06.416
(bomb whirring)

1:26:08.418 --> 1:26:09.294
- It's okay.

1:26:10.879 --> 1:26:11.672
It's okay.

1:26:15.675 --> 1:26:16.802
I'm letting Hendrichs out.

1:26:16.802 --> 1:26:17.636
- [Baines] He's gone.

1:26:19.221 --> 1:26:21.557
(tense music)

1:26:21.557 --> 1:26:23.225
- What do you mean?

1:26:23.225 --> 1:26:28.146
- I wanted to kill him,
but he was already gone.

1:26:30.023 --> 1:26:32.317
Did it to himself.

1:26:32.317 --> 1:26:34.778
(tense music)

1:26:46.540 --> 1:26:51.712
(rain splattering)
(tense music)

1:27:04.516 --> 1:27:07.477
(Baines chuckling)

1:27:12.482 --> 1:27:15.277
(Peter flapping)

1:28:10.958 --> 1:28:11.959
(computer beeping)

1:28:11.959 --> 1:28:14.294
- [Computer]
Establishing connection.

1:28:15.504 --> 1:28:18.715
(morse code beeping)

1:28:37.234 --> 1:28:39.903
(door rattling)

1:28:53.541 --> 1:28:56.753
(metronome clicking)

1:29:04.469 --> 1:29:07.264
(pages rustling)

1:29:17.107 --> 1:29:18.483
- [Cassidy] Storm
front incoming.

1:29:18.525 --> 1:29:20.818
ETA three hours to full contact.

1:29:22.905 --> 1:29:24.740
- [Sullivan] It's
two days early.

1:29:24.740 --> 1:29:26.366
- That's what it does.

1:29:27.284 --> 1:29:28.035
It changes.

1:29:30.954 --> 1:29:32.748
Possible salvage,
due north west.

1:29:34.416 --> 1:29:35.209
- Alone?

1:29:37.169 --> 1:29:38.170
- We need the material.

1:29:46.887 --> 1:29:49.556
(door creaking)

1:29:57.272 --> 1:30:00.067
(chain rattling)

1:30:04.487 --> 1:30:05.656
- You seen this?

1:30:08.325 --> 1:30:09.117
- He's back.

1:30:10.285 --> 1:30:11.286
Fixing things.

1:30:12.579 --> 1:30:15.040
(door creaking)

1:30:15.040 --> 1:30:15.832
- I'll drive.

1:30:19.002 --> 1:30:20.379
- It may do him some good.

1:30:34.601 --> 1:30:37.521
(Baines sighing)

1:30:38.605 --> 1:30:40.232
- She was pregnant.

1:30:40.232 --> 1:30:41.023
Liz.

1:30:44.987 --> 1:30:47.531
She was six months
in when I left.

1:30:49.157 --> 1:30:51.326
I don't even know if
it's a boy or a girl.

1:30:58.458 --> 1:31:02.921
Sully, I wanted to-
- No, save it.

1:31:04.798 --> 1:31:06.425
Go.

1:31:06.425 --> 1:31:09.511
Go salvage some useful
shit before I blow you up.

1:31:10.429 --> 1:31:13.432
(Baines chuckling)

1:31:14.933 --> 1:31:17.227
And look after her, hmm?

1:31:22.065 --> 1:31:23.192
(Sullivan chuckling)

1:31:23.192 --> 1:31:24.401
Oh, yeah.

1:31:29.489 --> 1:31:30.949
It's okay.

1:31:30.949 --> 1:31:32.201
Bring me something nice.

1:31:33.619 --> 1:31:35.077
- Sully, I did it.

1:31:35.077 --> 1:31:35.913
- You fixed the sink?

1:31:37.039 --> 1:31:38.207
- Sink?

1:31:38.207 --> 1:31:39.875
Fixed that a week ago.

1:31:40.416 --> 1:31:41.919
- Mother fucker.

1:31:41.919 --> 1:31:45.214
- Cats, horses, swallows.

1:31:46.507 --> 1:31:48.634
(door thudding)

1:31:48.634 --> 1:31:51.553
(chain rattling)

1:31:58.559 --> 1:32:00.812
- [Sullivan] Just in case.

1:32:13.784 --> 1:32:16.577
(tender music)

1:32:34.137 --> 1:32:36.932
(water rippling)

1:32:41.311 --> 1:32:43.981
(waves bobbing)

1:32:49.361 --> 1:32:52.155
(wheel creaking)

1:32:58.120 --> 1:33:00.496
(tense music)

1:33:11.049 --> 1:33:13.927
(winch tattering)

1:33:16.263 --> 1:33:18.932
(waves lapping)

1:33:28.942 --> 1:33:31.612
(tense music)

1:33:33.572 --> 1:33:36.657
(Sullivan groaning)

1:33:48.545 --> 1:33:51.465
(Sullivan groaning)

1:33:56.344 --> 1:33:58.805
(tense music)

1:34:05.187 --> 1:34:08.065
(waves lapping)

1:34:12.945 --> 1:34:15.531
(uneasy music)

1:34:30.128 --> 1:34:33.130
(drawers thudding)

1:34:42.307 --> 1:34:44.726
(tense music)

1:34:57.614 --> 1:35:00.576
(thunder rumbling)

1:35:02.661 --> 1:35:05.496
(rain splattering)

1:35:09.626 --> 1:35:12.087
(tense music)

1:35:22.347 --> 1:35:25.309
(rain splattering)

1:35:26.684 --> 1:35:29.478
(beacon humming)

1:35:57.799 --> 1:36:00.219
(tense music)

1:36:03.597 --> 1:36:06.099
(uneasy music)

1:36:23.032 --> 1:36:26.036
(items clattering)

1:36:34.878 --> 1:36:39.216
- I don't like it, Sarge,
it should be right here.

1:36:40.175 --> 1:36:42.094
It must have gone.

1:36:42.094 --> 1:36:45.597
- If it'd gone,
there'd be no signal.

1:36:45.597 --> 1:36:48.559
(rain splattering)

1:36:50.434 --> 1:36:52.896
(tense music)

1:36:58.568 --> 1:37:01.362
(waves crashing)

1:37:04.032 --> 1:37:06.952
(items clattering)

1:37:08.662 --> 1:37:11.123
(tense music)

1:37:20.674 --> 1:37:21.466
- Sarge.

1:37:22.384 --> 1:37:25.137
(waves crashing)

1:37:27.472 --> 1:37:31.059
(rain splattering)

1:37:31.059 --> 1:37:33.520
(tense music)

1:37:41.320 --> 1:37:42.112
- Hello?

1:37:44.740 --> 1:37:45.657
Are you okay?

1:37:53.040 --> 1:37:55.918
(radar beeping)

1:38:01.255 --> 1:38:04.259
(waves crashing)

1:38:09.264 --> 1:38:10.057
Hello.

1:38:12.184 --> 1:38:12.893
Hello?

1:38:13.809 --> 1:38:16.480
(tense music)

1:38:40.587 --> 1:38:41.672
Are you okay?

1:38:48.804 --> 1:38:51.264
(gun booming)

1:38:56.562 --> 1:38:59.356
(uneasy music)

1:39:08.115 --> 1:39:08.907
- Sully.

1:39:11.785 --> 1:39:12.911
I begged him.

1:39:15.664 --> 1:39:18.416
He climbed off
across the plastic

1:39:19.793 --> 1:39:22.045
and he wouldn't come back.

1:39:25.424 --> 1:39:26.216
I'm sorry.

1:39:28.886 --> 1:39:31.889
(Cassidy sobbing)

1:39:39.313 --> 1:39:42.065
(uneasy music)

1:40:01.460 --> 1:40:04.338
(Cassidy gasping)

1:40:12.930 --> 1:40:13.722
Sully?

1:40:56.889 --> 1:41:00.477
(radio squelching)
Sully?

1:41:05.607 --> 1:41:08.693
(radio squelching)
Sully, I'm sorry I slept in.

1:41:08.693 --> 1:41:10.571
Come in, are you there?

1:41:16.493 --> 1:41:18.829
(radio squelching)

1:41:19.162 --> 1:41:20.330
That thing you gave me.

1:41:21.707 --> 1:41:23.416
The metal globe.

1:41:25.377 --> 1:41:27.588
I think I figured
out what it is.

1:41:29.214 --> 1:41:31.258
It's funny, you'll like it.

1:41:31.258 --> 1:41:33.760
(radio squelching)

1:41:33.760 --> 1:41:36.305
(uneasy music)

1:41:39.516 --> 1:41:40.976
(radio squelching)
Sully?

1:41:45.022 --> 1:41:47.691
(door creaking)

1:41:49.735 --> 1:41:50.527
Sully?

1:41:55.365 --> 1:41:56.157
Sullivan?

1:41:58.535 --> 1:42:00.037
(radio squelching)
- I'm here.

1:42:08.003 --> 1:42:10.422
It was his third tour out here.

1:42:10.422 --> 1:42:11.215
Hendrichs.

1:42:13.342 --> 1:42:15.260
He wanted to stay.

1:42:15.260 --> 1:42:16.469
Put that in his report.

1:42:19.348 --> 1:42:20.474
Asking for another shift.

1:42:23.769 --> 1:42:25.062
He didn't want to leave.

1:42:32.027 --> 1:42:33.445
(radio squelching)

1:42:33.445 --> 1:42:37.157
- Sully, his mental state
was so unpredictable.

1:42:40.661 --> 1:42:42.204
You saw what happened to him.

1:42:48.502 --> 1:42:51.588
- [Sullivan] What
did happen to him?

1:42:53.924 --> 1:42:55.759
He didn't kill himself.

1:42:58.094 --> 1:42:59.513
But you know that.

1:43:00.472 --> 1:43:01.264
Don't you?

1:43:08.438 --> 1:43:10.273
And the relief crew?

1:43:11.400 --> 1:43:13.986
(uneasy music)

1:43:18.824 --> 1:43:20.242
I know it was you.

1:43:24.996 --> 1:43:26.832
I know why you're here.

1:43:28.709 --> 1:43:31.295
(uneasy music)

1:43:53.108 --> 1:43:54.860
(radio squelching)
- Sullivan.

1:43:56.320 --> 1:43:59.239
Sullivan, what do you mean?

1:44:00.616 --> 1:44:03.660
I don't understand.
(radio squelching)

1:44:03.660 --> 1:44:06.663
- [Sullivan] I can't
let you have it.

1:44:08.790 --> 1:44:10.501
(radio squelching)

1:44:10.501 --> 1:44:12.252
- Let me have what?

1:44:16.423 --> 1:44:19.425
(bomb whirring)

1:44:23.222 --> 1:44:26.099
(worrisome music)

1:44:26.099 --> 1:44:28.101
(bomb whirring)

1:44:32.814 --> 1:44:35.817
(computer beeping)

1:44:48.246 --> 1:44:51.124
(buttons beeping)

1:44:53.043 --> 1:44:53.835
Sullivan.

1:44:56.713 --> 1:44:58.215
What are you doing?

1:44:58.215 --> 1:45:00.884
I don't understand.
- Just stop.

1:45:03.762 --> 1:45:04.763
- Stop what?

1:45:07.014 --> 1:45:08.016
- It's over.

1:45:10.434 --> 1:45:12.187
You really played me.

1:45:12.187 --> 1:45:12.938
- Sully.

1:45:16.608 --> 1:45:19.443
- Hooked me like
a big dumb fish.

1:45:21.612 --> 1:45:22.364
- No.

1:45:26.702 --> 1:45:28.452
- It never rained on our side.

1:45:30.706 --> 1:45:33.541
(sorrowful music)

1:45:42.718 --> 1:45:44.344
- I hated lying to you (sobs).

1:45:46.889 --> 1:45:50.225
(computer beeping)

1:45:50.225 --> 1:45:53.103
Sully, listen to me.

1:45:53.103 --> 1:45:56.231
- Don't.
- My homeland is sinking.

1:45:56.231 --> 1:45:59.985
My people will perish if I
didn't get hold of that thing.

1:46:01.403 --> 1:46:03.572
All I want is to
end their suffering.

1:46:03.572 --> 1:46:05.365
- So that someone else
would suffer instead?

1:46:07.159 --> 1:46:08.911
No one should have it.

1:46:09.870 --> 1:46:12.496
Not your people, not mine.

1:46:16.210 --> 1:46:17.169
No one.

1:46:17.169 --> 1:46:18.212
(computer beeping)
- Sully.

1:46:18.212 --> 1:46:19.046
- Like you said, Cass.

1:46:20.172 --> 1:46:24.175
We just keep on fucking up.

1:46:26.261 --> 1:46:29.097
(Cassidy sobbing)

1:46:30.724 --> 1:46:32.184
- That's how it is.

1:46:35.312 --> 1:46:37.773
- It doesn't have to be.

1:46:37.773 --> 1:46:42.945
(uplifting music)
(computer beeping)

1:46:45.531 --> 1:46:48.200
(tense music)

1:46:59.378 --> 1:47:02.255
(Cassidy gasping)

1:47:12.349 --> 1:47:15.227
(waves lapping)

1:47:17.521 --> 1:47:20.523
(computer beeping)

1:47:44.715 --> 1:47:45.507
- What?

1:47:49.887 --> 1:47:52.889
(computer beeping)

1:48:00.022 --> 1:48:02.773
(bomb whirring)

1:48:04.193 --> 1:48:05.777
- Baines.

1:48:05.777 --> 1:48:08.780
(bomb whirring)

1:49:10.925 --> 1:49:13.219
We're not leaning anymore.

1:49:15.389 --> 1:49:16.348
- No.

1:49:20.769 --> 1:49:22.521
And we're still here.

1:49:31.737 --> 1:49:32.948
- So what now?

1:49:38.370 --> 1:49:40.205
- Now it's up to us.

1:49:43.541 --> 1:49:45.502
- And if someone comes?

1:49:49.423 --> 1:49:50.215
- Yours?

1:49:53.969 --> 1:49:54.928
- Or yours.

1:49:56.305 --> 1:49:59.099
(tender music)

1:50:00.893 --> 1:50:03.437
- Then we protect the swallows.

1:50:07.858 --> 1:50:08.650
Together.

1:50:14.615 --> 1:50:16.867
And with everything we have.

1:50:27.460 --> 1:50:31.255
- So, what is it?

1:50:32.382 --> 1:50:34.927
(tender music)

1:51:06.291 --> 1:51:08.960
(bird tweeting)

1:51:12.840 --> 1:51:15.634
(birds tweeting)

1:51:18.804 --> 1:51:21.473
(upbeat music)

1:52:21.325 --> 1:52:24.036
(upbeat music)

1:52:53.398 --> 1:52:55.859
(tense music)

1:53:55.335 --> 1:53:57.880
(tense music)

1:54:57.606 --> 1:55:00.359
(gentle music)

1:55:59.334 --> 1:56:01.962
(gentle music)
