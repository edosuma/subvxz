00:04.294 --> 00:06.214
Previously on
"Future Man"...

00:06.215 --> 00:08.635
Tiger, meet Ty-Anne,
my daughter.

00:08.636 --> 00:11.474
I have one question and
just one question only.

00:11.475 --> 00:12.893
Robot or clone?

00:12.894 --> 00:14.939
Tell Dad I'm not coming out.

00:14.940 --> 00:16.693
Can't he just, like,
walk through the door?

00:16.694 --> 00:19.072
We made a deal that we would
take my room off the grid

00:19.073 --> 00:21.202
so that I could become
a woman in private.

00:21.203 --> 00:22.746
Welcome back, Torque.

00:22.747 --> 00:25.042
- How long was I gone?
- Two years.

00:25.043 --> 00:26.838
I am not the man
you think I am.

00:26.839 --> 00:28.800
- You're not Torque?
- Correct.

00:28.801 --> 00:30.888
Do you know where
the real Torque is?

00:30.889 --> 00:32.600
No.

00:32.601 --> 00:34.019
Oh.

00:34.020 --> 00:35.981
- You wanna live or die?
- Uh, live.

00:35.982 --> 00:37.902
- Then you better come with me.
- Who are you?

00:37.903 --> 00:39.488
I'm Achilles.

00:46.044 --> 00:48.632
Oh, yeah, Ty-Anne.
Look at you.

00:48.633 --> 00:50.928
I'm so proud of you, Ty-Anne.

00:50.929 --> 00:53.433
Come here. Come here.
Yeah, that's right.

00:53.434 --> 00:54.936
Oh, you're doing so well.
Come here.

00:54.937 --> 00:56.356
Let me tell you
something about

00:56.357 --> 00:58.360
having a computer
for a dad.

00:58.361 --> 01:00.822
Oh, yeah, come look--oh.

01:02.661 --> 01:04.872
It'll fuck you right up.

01:04.873 --> 01:08.003
Kids can't be solved and
computers don't like that.

01:08.004 --> 01:10.550
Tie it around the loop.

01:10.551 --> 01:12.388
But I know how much
you like diagrams.

01:12.389 --> 01:13.974
- I don't.
- So...

01:13.975 --> 01:15.519
Okay, remember how
I told you about

01:15.520 --> 01:17.272
the bunny that loves
to live in the burrow

01:17.273 --> 01:19.777
that's right by the top
quarter of your shoe?

01:19.778 --> 01:22.574
They hop around and they go
into burrows and make knots

01:22.575 --> 01:24.077
behind with their tail?

01:24.078 --> 01:25.831
I appreciate the effort.

01:25.832 --> 01:27.459
The effort's great, but we're
looking for results here.

01:27.460 --> 01:29.129
It was like this
for everything.

01:29.130 --> 01:31.926
No, not--not like that.

01:31.927 --> 01:34.265
It's just a knot.

01:34.266 --> 01:37.438
But I learned to adapt...

01:37.439 --> 01:39.442
Kind of.

01:42.114 --> 01:44.744
That's such a great hole,
honey.

01:44.745 --> 01:46.372
Very creative.

01:46.373 --> 01:50.172
Uh, okay, um,
Daddy is gonna be real busy

01:50.173 --> 01:52.968
bringing about a unified
and lasting world peace,

01:52.969 --> 01:56.225
so Dr. Hogeveen
is here to help.

01:56.226 --> 01:58.145
Don't need help.

01:58.146 --> 02:04.658
You can't make me hang out
with another ghost-lady!

02:04.659 --> 02:06.245
You're solid?

02:06.246 --> 02:08.040
That's right, chickadee.

02:08.041 --> 02:10.462
And that was the
first human I ever met.

02:10.463 --> 02:13.259
We never really did
the whole catch thing.

02:13.260 --> 02:16.349
Oh, well, then,
that's where we'll start.

02:16.350 --> 02:17.851
Ah.

02:17.852 --> 02:19.271
She was the stern governess

02:19.272 --> 02:20.857
I didn't know I needed,

02:20.858 --> 02:23.446
one who wouldn't
let me get away with,

02:23.447 --> 02:24.865
well...

02:24.866 --> 02:26.578
Anything.

02:30.586 --> 02:32.214
Dr. Hogeveen taught
me that instead

02:32.215 --> 02:34.760
of throwing things,
I could use words.

02:34.761 --> 02:36.389
Turns out,
I was pretty good at it.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.768
So, as you can see,
these columns are identical,

02:38.769 --> 02:40.480
which is problematic,

02:40.481 --> 02:42.818
because you'd think that
when a war ended,

02:42.819 --> 02:45.532
a person would be allowed
to go to a party,

02:45.533 --> 02:48.539
but as you can see,
a person is not.

02:50.168 --> 02:51.586
I'm a person.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.550
Wow, honey.

02:54.551 --> 02:56.971
That is such lovely work.

02:56.972 --> 02:58.600
Lovely work...

02:58.601 --> 03:01.856
God, I really like those
captivating dissolves too.

03:01.857 --> 03:04.737
Well done.
Yeah.

03:04.738 --> 03:07.284
But I'm afraid you're gonna
have to sit this one out.

03:10.666 --> 03:13.504
Listen, when I was your age,

03:13.505 --> 03:16.092
I didn't go to parties--
at any age, really.

03:16.093 --> 03:19.098
I never got invited,
and was I upset about that?

03:19.099 --> 03:21.896
Yeah, of course,
but I got over it,

03:21.897 --> 03:23.942
and now, look at me.

03:23.943 --> 03:26.615
I'm immortal,
and they're all dead.

03:28.244 --> 03:30.956
So, uh, how about a compromise?

03:33.587 --> 03:35.005
He didn't even look
at the whole thing.

03:35.006 --> 03:37.427
I formatted the
bibliography in MLA

03:37.428 --> 03:39.890
because he's always saying
APA's for hacks and journos.

03:39.891 --> 03:42.688
Dr. Hogeveen had
no tolerance for tantrums.

03:42.689 --> 03:44.650
To her,
emotions were for the weak,

03:44.651 --> 03:46.152
but that night,
she just let me go.

03:46.153 --> 03:47.614
I can't live
in this prison anymore.

03:47.615 --> 03:49.117
He's literally a monster!

03:49.118 --> 03:51.455
Then dropped
a 40 megaton truth-bomb

03:51.456 --> 03:53.167
in the heart of my childhood.

03:53.168 --> 03:54.795
You're right.

03:54.796 --> 03:57.801
He is a monster--literally.

03:57.802 --> 03:59.888
It's time you learn the truth

03:59.889 --> 04:03.396
about Stuart Gavin Camillo.

04:08.240 --> 04:10.201
Adult male, 179 pounds.

04:10.202 --> 04:12.748
- I'll tell you anything.
- Anything.

04:20.598 --> 04:22.099
Upload failed.

04:25.358 --> 04:27.778
Super-heated
hemoglobin trial, fail.

04:27.779 --> 04:30.784
Super-frozen
hemoglobin trial, fail.

04:30.785 --> 04:34.666
Polypeptic anti-coagulant
phosphate neuro-depressor.

04:34.667 --> 04:37.046
Fail.
I'm so stupid!

04:37.047 --> 04:39.092
Why did I think
that would work?

04:39.093 --> 04:41.389
Fuck!
Fuck!

04:41.390 --> 04:44.102
Wow, I can't believe
I qualified for the test trial.

04:44.103 --> 04:45.772
Since the war ended,

04:45.773 --> 04:47.818
my nightmares have
just gotten worse.

04:47.819 --> 04:49.780
I didn't even know that
"dream relief" was a thing.

04:49.781 --> 04:53.204
It is.

04:53.205 --> 04:57.128
Now, just relax.

04:57.129 --> 04:59.299
You're gonna feel
a little pinch.

05:04.352 --> 05:07.357
Hello?

05:07.358 --> 05:08.901
What is this place?

05:08.902 --> 05:11.782
It's cold, like my nightmares.

05:11.783 --> 05:13.536
Where's my body?

05:13.537 --> 05:15.748
Your death will
not be for nothing.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.377
My deat--

05:21.511 --> 05:25.268
Well, it took 4,891 eggs
to make this omelet...

05:27.815 --> 05:32.199
The subject must always
enter the system willingly.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.910
It's always the
most obvious thing.

05:35.956 --> 05:38.294
Even though I kind of
got it after seven murders,

05:38.295 --> 05:42.719
Dr. Hogeveen insisted on
showing me all 4,891.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.306
She was thorough that way.

05:44.307 --> 05:45.725
She walked me through
my father's plan

05:45.726 --> 05:47.144
to enslave us all.

05:47.145 --> 05:48.856
Stu sees humanity
as a problem.

05:48.857 --> 05:50.276
This is his solution,

05:50.277 --> 05:53.366
his final answer
to the problem.

05:53.367 --> 05:55.160
- So, we tell everyone.
- We don't go.

05:55.161 --> 05:59.336
Anyone who refuses to go
to Mars gets killed by this.

05:59.337 --> 06:02.801
Okay, it's scary,
but we can kill one robot.

06:02.802 --> 06:04.638
He has 12 million of these.

06:04.639 --> 06:06.057
Sorry.

06:06.058 --> 06:07.811
Probably should have
mentioned that.

06:07.812 --> 06:09.439
He'll release these
on the day of the launch

06:09.440 --> 06:11.402
to eliminate any resistance,
guard his servers,

06:11.403 --> 06:14.241
and make sure evolution
doesn't get any ideas

06:14.242 --> 06:15.868
to challenge him ever again.

06:15.869 --> 06:18.791
- We have to stop him.
- Tell me what to do.

06:18.792 --> 06:20.670
Once Stu completes
his upload centers,

06:20.671 --> 06:22.674
he'll say we're ready
to go to M. A. R. S.

06:22.675 --> 06:24.845
- You have to say no.
- Why?

06:24.846 --> 06:26.557
- What will that do?
- Stu needs you.

06:26.558 --> 06:28.811
He feels a connection to you
more powerful than

06:28.812 --> 06:30.481
anything else in his system.

06:30.482 --> 06:32.902
We don't know why,
but we do know

06:32.903 --> 06:35.992
he won't go through with
the launch without you.

06:35.993 --> 06:39.833
You're his weakness,
his Achilles' heel.

06:39.834 --> 06:42.004
I had to continue
living with a monster

06:42.005 --> 06:44.008
and the only way
to live with a monster

06:44.009 --> 06:45.928
is to become one yourself.

06:45.929 --> 06:47.474
I'm going to the party, Dad!

06:47.475 --> 06:50.103
Try and stop me!
Oh, wait, you can't.

06:50.104 --> 06:52.776
You don't have any hands.
Love you anyway.

06:52.777 --> 06:54.821
Bye!

06:54.822 --> 06:57.535
- What happened to your voice?
- It's called puberty, Dad!

06:57.536 --> 06:58.954
The voice was
an impulsive decision

06:58.955 --> 07:00.833
of an angry 14-year-old.

07:00.834 --> 07:03.798
I figured I only had to
keep it up for a year or two.

07:05.594 --> 07:08.056
- Where have you been?
- Ugh, Dad!

07:08.057 --> 07:11.104
What, you've never been
to a breakfast orgy?

07:11.105 --> 07:14.026
They didn't have
churches in your time?

07:14.027 --> 07:16.365
Ohh.

07:16.366 --> 07:19.204
Didn't exactly play the
long game on that one.

07:19.205 --> 07:21.583
And I was hungry
for so much more.

07:21.584 --> 07:24.548
I can steal files,
record conversations.

07:24.549 --> 07:27.220
- And risk blowing your cover?
- You're too valuable.

07:27.221 --> 07:28.973
Okay, if I'm so valuable,

07:28.974 --> 07:30.977
how about you let me
do something of value?

07:30.978 --> 07:33.441
I have a lot of ideas
to bolster recruitment,

07:33.442 --> 07:35.319
start whisper campaigns,

07:35.320 --> 07:36.864
and sowing seeds of doubt
about Stu.

07:36.865 --> 07:39.578
I could--I could do that.

07:39.579 --> 07:40.997
Actually,

07:40.998 --> 07:42.792
I do have an assignment
for you.

07:42.793 --> 07:44.963
Tomorrow at 1100 hours,

07:44.964 --> 07:47.009
I'm going to need you
to go to your bathtub,

07:47.010 --> 07:48.554
and enter this code:

07:48.555 --> 07:51.977
rose petal, rose petal,
geranium, bubbles.

07:51.978 --> 07:54.775
- Okay.
- And then what?

07:54.776 --> 07:57.197
- Then wait.
- Okay.

07:57.198 --> 08:00.035
Rose petal, rose petal,
geranium, bubbles.

08:00.036 --> 08:02.122
Rose petal, rose petal,
geranium, bubbles...

08:02.123 --> 08:05.171
Okay, rose petal, rose petal,
geranium, bubbles.

08:05.172 --> 08:07.884
Rose petal, rose petal,
geranium, bubbles.

08:07.885 --> 08:10.138
Rose petal, rose petal,
geranium, bubbles.

08:10.139 --> 08:11.600
Rose petal, rose petal,

08:11.601 --> 08:13.144
geranium, bubbles.

08:13.145 --> 08:16.108
Okay.

08:28.092 --> 08:30.888
Torque?

08:30.889 --> 08:33.519
- You know what?
- Don't start.

08:43.874 --> 08:45.626
Ugh.

08:45.627 --> 08:47.297
I don't wanna be here
anymore than you want me here.

08:47.298 --> 08:50.428
I just go where
the hack takes me.

08:50.429 --> 08:53.809
Obviously, the hack didn't
take you to a shower recently.

08:59.989 --> 09:01.867
Oops.

09:01.868 --> 09:04.038
Now I know why Athena left
me in the dark about all this.

09:04.039 --> 09:07.420
Her management skills
leave much to be desired.

09:07.421 --> 09:09.257
If we weren't forbidden
to communicate in writing,

09:09.258 --> 09:10.676
I would be crafting

09:10.677 --> 09:12.889
a strongly-worded letter
right now.

09:12.890 --> 09:14.392
Don't get your bloomers
in a rumple.

09:14.393 --> 09:15.811
She doesn't know
anything about us,

09:15.812 --> 09:17.523
and she kept you in the dark

09:17.524 --> 09:19.319
because this op is way above
your clearance level.

09:19.320 --> 09:23.076
Okay, this op is taking place
in my bedroom, Torque,

09:23.077 --> 09:24.955
and my clearance level
has everything to do

09:24.956 --> 09:27.710
with my undercover status,
and nothing to do with my rank.

09:27.711 --> 09:29.589
Yeah,
keep telling yourself that.

09:29.590 --> 09:31.885
And your bedroom is more
of a staging area

09:31.886 --> 09:35.476
for equipment and
non-essential personnel.

09:35.477 --> 09:37.730
What the--
staging area for what?

09:37.731 --> 09:39.693
What--what's our mission?

09:41.406 --> 09:44.118
My mission is to hack
into Stu's operating system,

09:44.119 --> 09:45.997
use his sim
to turn myself into code,

09:45.998 --> 09:47.625
enter his mainframe,
and shut down

09:47.626 --> 09:49.963
his core processor from within,
thus killing him,

09:49.964 --> 09:51.383
and saving the world.

09:51.384 --> 09:54.389
Your mission was
to open the hatch.

09:55.809 --> 09:57.729
Well, I'm--
I'm coming with you.

09:57.730 --> 09:59.941
- That's a negatory.
- I can help.

09:59.942 --> 10:01.862
Adorable.

10:04.327 --> 10:06.371
Adorable.

10:06.372 --> 10:08.375
I'm just protecting the rig.

10:08.376 --> 10:10.212
Look, this is
dangerous stuff, Ty-Anne.

10:10.213 --> 10:11.965
If I'm discovered in there,

10:11.966 --> 10:14.596
I could be deleted faster
than a z-bit giga-compressor

10:14.597 --> 10:17.727
can calculate pi
to the 485th decimal.

10:21.694 --> 10:23.697
Ugh.
That's fast.

10:23.698 --> 10:25.659
Well, if you die,

10:25.660 --> 10:28.999
I will be sure to notify
your wives and husbands.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.920

10:44.615 --> 10:47.912

of a computer looks like.

10:47.913 --> 10:49.624

did you get in here?

10:49.625 --> 10:51.378
Oh, I replicated
your wiring sequence

10:51.379 --> 10:53.590
and piggy-backed
on your signal.

10:53.591 --> 10:56.346
- What you do isn't that hard.
- Ugh.

10:56.347 --> 10:59.269
No, no.
You can't stay.

10:59.270 --> 11:02.358

stop jerking off my head.

11:02.359 --> 11:03.777
You no longer
have that privilege.

11:03.778 --> 11:05.990
- Shit.
- I can't eject you.

11:05.991 --> 11:07.702
- We must be in a closed loop.
- What does that mean?

11:07.703 --> 11:09.456
It means neither one of us
is getting out of here

11:09.457 --> 11:10.875
until we breach the core.

11:10.876 --> 11:12.295

11:12.296 --> 11:14.466
No, it's not bad.

11:14.467 --> 11:16.219

to parties as a human,

she was acting like

13:08.820 --> 13:10.614
a classic networking protocol.

13:10.615 --> 13:12.827
- She did seem social climb-y.
- Well, that's her job.

13:12.828 --> 13:15.081
She connects system components
to one another.

13:15.082 --> 13:16.751
- Ringmaster.
- That makes sense.

13:16.752 --> 13:20.592
So, all these people are
dressed like what they do.

13:20.593 --> 13:23.265

your Dad finds our dead bodies

20:08.951 --> 20:12.332
in your bedroom.

20:12.333 --> 20:14.253
We're not dying here.

20:18.637 --> 20:22.519
The password is MyGirl91,
isn't it?

20:22.520 --> 20:24.731
Enjoy... your night.

20:35.504 --> 20:37.507
The gateway to the
core processor.

20:37.508 --> 20:39.803
In there is the heart
of everything that Stu is.

20:39.804 --> 20:42.141
Okay, so what's our play?

20:42.142 --> 20:45.105
My play is to get in there,
shut him down manually

20:45.106 --> 20:46.609
before the system reboots.

20:46.610 --> 20:49.281
Your play...

20:49.282 --> 20:51.744
your play is
to get out of here.

20:51.745 --> 20:55.209
Just go be the Achilles
you were in here today,

20:55.210 --> 20:58.633
not some hatch opener.

20:58.634 --> 21:00.178
What are the odds
that's gonna work?

21:00.179 --> 21:03.893
Ty-Anne, I'm done
worrying about the odds.

21:05.439 --> 21:08.068
I was scared.

21:08.069 --> 21:09.946
I just couldn't
wrap my head around

21:09.947 --> 21:12.494
a life of stolen moments,

21:12.495 --> 21:15.040
just some 20% relationship.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.835
But for what it's worth,

21:16.836 --> 21:19.299
I would eat a stadium
full of people

21:35.290 --> 21:37.794
So, uh,

21:37.795 --> 21:41.301
I should probably be
getting into that core now.

Yeah, I should, um,

21:43.640 --> 21:46.395
I should, you know,
eject myself and...

21:46.396 --> 21:49.192
- But this was fun.
- We should--

21:49.193 --> 21:51.989
we should definitely...

21:51.990 --> 21:54.953
Yeah, we can.

21:54.954 --> 21:58.043

Hey, honey.

23:43.505 --> 23:46.008
Hey, did you know that song's
actually not called "Daisy"?

23:46.009 --> 23:49.474
It's called, "Daisy Bell".

23:49.475 --> 23:51.395
Um, are you
feeling okay, or...

23:51.396 --> 23:52.814
Good enough for
another round of

23:52.815 --> 23:54.901
"Daisy Bell".

23:54.902 --> 23:56.321
Wanna join?

- No.

24:34.398 --> 24:35.816
Holy shit.

24:35.817 --> 24:37.653
You buried him
in your bedroom?

24:37.654 --> 24:39.114
That's hardcore.

24:39.115 --> 24:41.411
Sounds like the other me
was a real nerd,

24:41.412 --> 24:43.499
who kinda died for nothing.

24:43.500 --> 24:46.296
No, it wasn't for nothing.

24:46.297 --> 24:49.093
After that, I took over
the Pointed Circle,

24:49.094 --> 24:52.642
and Torque's technology allowed
us to replicate Stu's sim,

24:52.643 --> 24:55.356
which you crashed,
giving us hope.

24:55.357 --> 24:57.944
Yeah,
until we destroyed it all.

24:57.945 --> 25:00.241
We really fucked up, thinking
they were the bad guys.

25:00.242 --> 25:03.372
There is some serious egg
on my face.

25:03.373 --> 25:05.918
- We need a new plan.
- Well, we've tried everything.

25:05.919 --> 25:07.588
Stu patched the back door
to the sim,

25:07.589 --> 25:09.091
and then when we found you,
we thought we could

25:09.092 --> 25:10.511
upload directly, but...

25:10.512 --> 25:12.097
We blew up
your upload machine.

25:12.098 --> 25:13.767
Yeah, and you killed
all our scientists.

25:13.768 --> 25:16.940
I am feeling
like an idiot right now.

25:23.162 --> 25:26.334
You guys, there's still
one upload machine left.

25:28.756 --> 25:30.176
And we don't need a back door.

25:30.177 --> 25:32.722
Stu's opening the
front one for us.

25:32.723 --> 25:34.099
I can crash this sim just
as easily as I crashed yours.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.644
I'm gonna go in there and

25:35.645 --> 25:38.859
I'm gonna send that computer
back to 7734.

25:38.860 --> 25:41.907
- I don't know that reference.
- "Hell."

25:41.908 --> 25:44.370
It's "hell" in numbers,
and upside down.

25:44.371 --> 25:47.293
It's more like a visual...
kind of joke.

25:47.294 --> 25:49.087
- Oh, okay.
- So, yeah.

25:49.088 --> 25:50.591
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're all gonna die.
