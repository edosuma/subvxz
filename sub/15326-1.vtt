19:34.965 --> 19:36.550
I CAN'T DEAL
WITH ANY OF YOU PEOPLE.

19:36.633 --> 19:37.926
- OH, YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH US?

19:38.010 --> 19:39.970
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

19:40.053 --> 19:40.971
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:41.054 --> 19:43.682
YESTERDAY,
YOU GUYS WERE BFFs.

19:43.765 --> 19:44.850
- BFFs?

19:44.933 --> 19:48.478
- WHAT?
IS THAT OVER TOO?

19:48.562 --> 19:51.106
LOOK, ANYWAY, WHATEVER'S
HAPPENED BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU,

19:51.189 --> 19:53.817
I'D LIKE TO STEP IN AND SEE
IF I CAN HELP YOU WORK IT OUT.

19:53.901 --> 19:54.943
- YOU CAN'T.
- DON'T BOTHER.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.570
- THANK GOD.

19:56.653 --> 19:58.906
- LOOK.

19:58.989 --> 20:01.825
I'LL ADMIT I KIND OF
TOOK A FUNKY SWING AT THIS

20:01.909 --> 20:05.245
IF YOU'LL ADMIT
THAT YOU BETRAYED MY TRUST.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.039
- I ONLY BETRAYED YOUR TRUST

20:07.122 --> 20:09.166
BECAUSE YOU WENT BACK
ON YOUR WORD.

20:09.249 --> 20:10.542
LOOK, IF YOU WANT US
TO BE COOL,

20:10.626 --> 20:12.336
YOU CAN'T TREAT ME LIKE A KID

20:12.419 --> 20:14.379
AND EMBARRASS ME
IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS.

20:14.463 --> 20:18.675
- BY THE WAY,
THE TEN BUCKS IS NONREFUNDABLE.

20:18.759 --> 20:21.136
- YOU ARE A DEAD MAN.
COME HERE!

20:21.219 --> 20:24.306
- I WANT TO BE A DEAD MAN TOO.

20:24.389 --> 20:27.309
DAD SAID NOT TO LEAVE ME OUT.

20:27.392 --> 20:30.812
- SO WHEN DOES THEIR MOM
GET BACK AGAIN?

20:30.896 --> 20:32.773
- YEAH.

20:32.856 --> 20:36.109
UM, ACTUALLY,
SHE JUST CALLED.

20:36.193 --> 20:38.153
HER MOM'S NOT DOING WELL.

20:38.236 --> 20:41.823
WE MAY HAVE THE KIDS
FOR A WHILE.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.241
YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

20:43.325 --> 20:45.035
- OF COURSE.

20:45.118 --> 20:46.662
IT'S JUST...

20:46.745 --> 20:50.040
IT'S JUST THIS REAL DEAL,
FULL-TIME MOTHERHOOD.

20:50.123 --> 20:53.460
BABY, I THOUGHT I GOT THIS.

20:53.543 --> 20:55.837
BUT I DON'T GOT IT.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.173
BUT MY MOM DON'T GOT IT EITHER.

20:58.256 --> 20:58.882
AND IF I DON'T GOT IT
AND SHE DON'T GOT IT,

20:58.966 --> 21:02.594
WHO'S GOT IT?

21:02.678 --> 21:03.971
GABBY HATES ME.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.514
- SHE DOESN'T HATE YOU.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.432
SHE KNOWS SHE WAS WRONG.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.059
YOU JUST WATCH.

21:09.142 --> 21:10.686
IN FIVE MINUTES,
YOU TWO ARE GONNA BE--

21:10.769 --> 21:13.146
- BFFs?

21:13.230 --> 21:15.190
- BFFs.

21:15.273 --> 21:16.566
THAT'S THE THING ABOUT KIDS.

21:16.650 --> 21:19.111
SOMETIMES THEY LIKE YOU,
SOMETIMES THEY DON'T.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.738
AND SOMETIMES,
THEY JUST WANT YOU

21:21.822 --> 21:23.615
FOR TARGET PRACTICE.

21:23.699 --> 21:26.326
- AH!
- HEY!

21:26.410 --> 21:28.036
HEY, NO FAIR!

21:28.120 --> 21:29.329
[screams]

21:29.413 --> 21:30.455
OH, MY GOD!
