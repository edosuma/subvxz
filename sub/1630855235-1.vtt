WEBVTT

00:06.464 --> 00:08.091
<i>...should be prosecuted.</i>

00:08.091 --> 00:09.634
<i>And then
he doubled down on that</i>

00:09.634 --> 00:11.386
<i>- just before the election
took place.</i>

00:11.386 --> 00:13.388
<i>And then talked about it
again last week.</i>

00:13.388 --> 00:15.598
<i>Really extraordinary
the circumstances.</i>

00:15.598 --> 00:18.309
<i>Remember Hillary Clinton,
Secretary Clinton,</i>

00:18.309 --> 00:21.604
<i>just recently
came out and said
the Jim Comey letters</i>

00:21.604 --> 00:23.898
<i>and what he said
was one of the reasons</i>

00:23.898 --> 00:25.191
<i>she lost the election.</i>

00:25.191 --> 00:27.068
<i>Now we're saying
that he's been fired</i>

00:27.068 --> 00:28.903
<i>for basically
those decisions.</i>

00:28.903 --> 00:30.613
<i>I want to read a letter</i>

00:30.613 --> 00:34.576
<i>from President Trump,
uh, released just moments ago.</i>

00:34.576 --> 00:36.536
<i>"Dear Director Comey,
I have received</i>

00:36.536 --> 00:38.455
<i>"the attached letters
from the Attorney General</i>

00:38.455 --> 00:40.373
<i>"and the Deputy Attorney
General of the United States</i>

<i>for the FBI that restores--"</i>

02:49.336 --> 02:51.629
This is my partner Wa--
partner, Wally Taylor.

02:51.629 --> 02:52.881
Hey. How are you?

03:01.514 --> 03:03.141
<i>Hi.</i>

03:03.141 --> 03:04.893
Reality Winner:
<i>Hey.</i>

03:04.893 --> 03:06.144
Wally Taylor:
<i>How are you?</i>

03:06.144 --> 03:07.520
<i>Uh...</i>

03:08.813 --> 03:10.106
Good.
H-how are you doing?

03:10.106 --> 03:11.191
Good.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.567
How's your day today?

03:13.401 --> 03:16.654
Uh, it's pretty good.
Just got some groceries.

03:18.573 --> 03:19.741
Alright.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.498
Let's show you
who we are.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.561
Okay. Well, the reason
we're here today

03:48.561 --> 03:51.231
is that we have
a search warrant
for your house.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.859
- Okay.
- Justin Garrick: Alright.

03:54.859 --> 03:57.237
Uh, do you know
what this might be about?

03:58.530 --> 04:01.199
I have no idea.

04:01.533 --> 04:02.617
Okay.

04:02.617 --> 04:05.078
This is about, uh,
possible mishandling

04:05.078 --> 04:06.955
of classified information.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.082
Oh, my goodness. Okay.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.208
Mm-hmm.

04:10.875 --> 04:14.796
- So what we've got is,
uh, again, g-got a warrant.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.256
And, uh,

04:16.256 --> 04:17.799
I'm happy
to show it to you.

04:18.174 --> 04:19.843
<i>What I'd like to do
is sit down,</i>

04:19.843 --> 04:22.387
<i>talk you with, uh,
talk with you about it.</i>

04:23.680 --> 04:26.266
Kind of go over what,
what's going on.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.852
Uh, kind of get your,
your side of it.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.021
And, of course,
you're completely voluntary

04:31.021 --> 04:32.105
to talk to me.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.190
Uh, we can talk here

04:34.190 --> 04:37.402
or, uh, our office is
about five minutes away,

04:37.402 --> 04:39.362
uh, if you want to,
if you'd rather talk there.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.197
Then we can do
either one.

04:41.197 --> 04:42.741
It makes no difference
to me.

04:44.868 --> 04:46.703
- Okay.
Do you have any pets?

04:48.038 --> 04:50.290
- I do. I have two pets.
- 'Cause you-you've
been gone a while.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.459
So do, do we maybe need
to let 'em out,

04:52.459 --> 04:54.336
use the bathroom,
stuff like that?

04:54.336 --> 04:56.254
I, uh, I-I do.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.340
Um, would you mind

04:58.340 --> 05:00.300
if I at least get some
perishables into the fridge?

05:00.300 --> 05:01.426
And we can do that, too.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.053
But what we're gonna
have to do is, uh...

05:05.388 --> 05:06.806
Do you live
by yourself?

05:08.183 --> 05:09.392
Yes.

05:09.392 --> 05:10.643
Okay. What we're
gonna have to do is

05:10.643 --> 05:12.520
we're gonna have to go
into the house first,

05:12.520 --> 05:14.647
make sure it's,
it's safe.

05:15.815 --> 05:18.026
We have a search warrant,
so we-we're, uh,

05:18.026 --> 05:19.694
we're going to.

05:21.404 --> 05:22.405
- Absolutely.
Okay.

05:22.405 --> 05:23.823
And what we'll do is

05:23.823 --> 05:25.408
we'll keep you out here
until we do that

05:25.408 --> 05:27.494
and once we secure it,
we'll, uh...

05:27.494 --> 05:29.079
then we can kind of
go from there, okay?

05:29.079 --> 05:30.455
Of course.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.504
So is your dog friendly?

05:39.673 --> 05:41.966
Okay, well, uh, so...

05:42.926 --> 05:45.887
she doesn't... like men.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.597
- Okay.
- So...

05:47.597 --> 05:49.683
- So that's a problem.
- Yeah.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.435
- Um, she may come
towards you, but...
- Okay.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.729
She's never bitten anybody.
She's not aggressive.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.773
She's just got, you know,
a really good growl going.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.983
- Okay.
- She'll probably
hide under my desk.

05:58.983 --> 06:00.944
Do you have a,
a leash or--

06:00.944 --> 06:02.070
- I have a leash.
- Okay.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.655
I can, I can get her
leashed up.

06:04.781 --> 06:07.283
So what we might
want to do is maybe let you
go in there with her.

06:07.283 --> 06:08.493
You're not to touch
anything else.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.537
You're not to do
anything else
but get the dog

06:10.537 --> 06:11.746
and bring it out here.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.832
- We cool? We...
- Of course. I understand.

06:13.832 --> 06:16.084
Because otherwise,
if, if we have a problem,

06:16.084 --> 06:17.252
we're not gonna do that.

06:17.252 --> 06:18.962
I can move her
straight to the backyard.

06:18.962 --> 06:20.213
Okay.
- Okay.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.673
Uh, house key?

06:25.135 --> 06:26.177
House key.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.471
We also have a warrant
to search the car too.

06:28.471 --> 06:29.806
Do you have a cell phone?

06:38.023 --> 06:41.651
We'll take that, and we'll, uh,
kind of go from there, okay?

06:42.110 --> 06:44.404
Uh, but like he said,
we're completely voluntary,

06:44.404 --> 06:45.780
completely up to you on...

06:45.780 --> 06:47.991
But, you know, I think maybe
it'd be worth your time...

06:47.991 --> 06:49.784
- No, definitely.
- ...to listen, at least
for a little bit.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.286
- Um, definitely here...
- Okay?

06:51.286 --> 06:52.370
And we can
kind of figure out

06:52.370 --> 06:53.496
what's, what's going on.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.874
- ...to, uh, comply.
- Okay.

06:55.874 --> 06:58.501
Her leash is two feet
inside the door

06:58.501 --> 06:59.627
where I left it
this morning.

06:59.627 --> 07:01.546
I can move her
straight to the backyard.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.590
Are there
any weapons in the car?
In the house?

07:05.592 --> 07:08.178
- In the house, yes.
- What do you have?

07:11.097 --> 07:12.891
I have an AR-15.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.062
Is it pink?

07:19.314 --> 07:21.316
- It's pink.
- Okay.

07:21.316 --> 07:23.193
How'd you know?

07:25.904 --> 07:29.366
Uh, I have a Glock Nine
under the bed

07:29.366 --> 07:33.661
- and a, uh, a 15-gauge.
Okay.

07:33.661 --> 07:35.497
You sound like my house.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.540
Okay, we're good, then.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.417
Alright.
Just don't make any,

07:39.417 --> 07:41.753
any movements for those
and then we're...

07:42.587 --> 07:44.589
- Yeah.
Yeah.

07:44.589 --> 07:45.965
I mean, we're all cool.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.176
- Yeah.
Yeah.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.137
I mean, kind of obvious.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.014
- Yeah.
You can put, put...

07:53.014 --> 07:55.725
There's a little
fenced-in area
where you can put her?

07:56.643 --> 07:58.436
Uh, yes, yes.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.896
And you won't even
take your eyes off me.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.731
And we'll get water
and stuff like that.

08:01.731 --> 08:04.401
And this other guy, uh,
is with us as well.

08:04.401 --> 08:05.735
And we'll probably have
a few more people

08:05.735 --> 08:07.237
showing up here directly.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.206
<i>Is that the only pet?</i>

08:18.206 --> 08:19.249
<i>There is a cat.</i>

08:19.249 --> 08:21.251
<i>She will go
straight under the bed.</i>

08:21.251 --> 08:22.877
<i>Okay.</i>

08:24.045 --> 08:25.797
Jen doesn't like men.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.590
Starting to see
a trend here.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.801
Yeah. Y'all can come on out.
We found her.

08:30.385 --> 08:31.428
What's her name?

08:31.428 --> 08:33.346
Uh, Mickey.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.514
Hey, Mickey.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.598
Hey there.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.980
She doesn't know
what's going on, though.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.281
<i>There you go.</i>

08:59.956 --> 09:02.709
You don't have any weapons
or anything on you, do you?

09:03.251 --> 09:05.128
- No.
- None in the car?

09:05.128 --> 09:07.005
Um, in the car? No.

09:07.005 --> 09:09.049
- Hey.

09:10.342 --> 09:11.968
Hang on.
Hang on, hang on just--

09:11.968 --> 09:13.845
Can I close the door
for my cat?

09:16.139 --> 09:17.182
Alright.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.064
'Cause that-that's all
I care about right now.

09:27.942 --> 09:31.488
Okay, uh, so the only thing
in there now that's alive

09:31.488 --> 09:32.614
is the cat?

09:33.031 --> 09:35.575
Yes.
- There's not a person?

09:36.576 --> 09:37.869
No person.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.288
They're on their way?

09:40.288 --> 09:41.581
Yeah, they're pulling up.

10:03.478 --> 10:04.979
Why don't we, uh...

10:05.689 --> 10:08.024
Do you want to wait out here
with her for a minute?

10:08.024 --> 10:09.275
And Joe and I
will walk through.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.362
Again, just to explain,
we have a search warrant.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.738
It's...

10:13.738 --> 10:15.740
- I-I understand.
It's en route. So...

10:59.367 --> 11:00.910
It's alright.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.662
They're just making sure, uh,
just checking to make sure

11:02.662 --> 11:04.414
there's nobody else
in there

11:04.414 --> 11:06.458
or nothing... surprise!

11:06.458 --> 11:08.376
Surprise us
or anything like that.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.170
- Yup.
- So...

11:10.170 --> 11:11.588
I'm gonna make this

11:11.588 --> 11:13.757
as easy as possible
for you guys.

11:13.757 --> 11:15.800
Okay. Likewise.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.719
So hopefully
explain things,

11:17.719 --> 11:20.388
get to, uh,
figure this all out

11:20.388 --> 11:22.265
and, uh, wrap it up.

11:28.563 --> 11:30.106
How, uh,

11:30.106 --> 11:31.274
how, how old is she?

11:33.777 --> 11:35.779
We don't know.
She's one of those.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.655
Oh yeah. Yeah.
My, uh,

11:37.655 --> 11:39.282
one of my dogs is a rescue.

11:39.824 --> 11:42.577
And when I got him,
he wouldn't, uh...

11:43.203 --> 11:45.372
I was the only guy
who could touch him.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.373
Huh?

11:46.373 --> 11:47.957
Anybody else came
in the house,

11:47.957 --> 11:51.878
especially male,
he'd pee all over the place.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.463
But I could touch him,
and it was fine.

11:56.257 --> 11:59.678
So whoever had him
before was a real, uh,

11:59.678 --> 12:01.846
phew, real piece of work.

12:02.305 --> 12:06.017
Yeah. She was left in a kennel
and neglected her whole life.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.480
Why don't we, uh...

12:10.480 --> 12:12.816
Let's get the groceries,
throw 'em in the fridge
real quick,

12:12.816 --> 12:14.526
then we'll bring you
back out here, okay?

13:01.614 --> 13:02.949
<i>Is that...</i>

13:02.949 --> 13:05.076
<i>Uh, no, that's it
for the perishables.</i>

13:07.454 --> 13:08.496
Should be.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.505
The neighbors.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.726
Alright. If you could
just, uh, step over.

13:29.726 --> 13:30.769
Just here.

13:31.269 --> 13:33.188
Yeah.
Just stop right there.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.276
Look up here.

13:46.534 --> 13:47.577
Just...

14:00.924 --> 14:03.301
There's a cat in the house,
in the bed,

14:03.301 --> 14:04.928
- or it's on the bed.
- On the bed?

14:04.928 --> 14:07.097
- Or was on the bed.
- It's...

14:07.097 --> 14:09.432
It-it'll probably go
under the bed at some point.

14:09.432 --> 14:12.310
The dog is in
the backyard in the fence.

14:14.604 --> 14:15.647
Does...

14:18.566 --> 14:20.193
does she need water?

14:20.193 --> 14:21.361
She'll be fine.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.571
She's been inside all day
with her water.

14:24.739 --> 14:25.865
Okay.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.993
- Alrighty.

14:30.704 --> 14:31.663
Alright.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.456
So would you like
to talk here

14:33.456 --> 14:35.375
or talk, uh,

14:35.375 --> 14:36.459
talk at the office?

14:36.876 --> 14:39.045
Uh, we can go ahead
and talk here.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.714
Do you want
to talk here?

14:40.714 --> 14:42.590
- Sure.
- Okay.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.342
Uh, let's, uh...

14:45.760 --> 14:47.721
I'm trying to think
if we have any

14:47.721 --> 14:50.223
private place, uh,
there in the house that--

14:50.223 --> 14:51.641
D-do you have anything
there in the house

14:51.641 --> 14:53.935
that we can kind of sit
that's away...

14:56.312 --> 14:57.605
Away?

15:04.404 --> 15:06.823
There's one bedroom
that's empty.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.117
I don't...

15:09.117 --> 15:12.370
I-I don't, I don't really like
to go in there...

15:13.955 --> 15:15.498
other than...

15:16.374 --> 15:19.836
I guess I don't really have
anything else other than that,

15:19.836 --> 15:21.504
that back room.

15:21.504 --> 15:22.589
That back room?

15:25.175 --> 15:28.136
Okay. And it's, uh,
it's completely empty?

15:28.136 --> 15:29.387
Yeah. You'll go in there.

15:29.387 --> 15:30.597
There's, uh,

15:30.597 --> 15:32.474
there's one
dog kennel cage.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.851
Other than that,
I don't use it.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.936
Okay. Alright. Um,

15:36.936 --> 15:40.065
y-y-you said you don't like
to go in there. But, uh...

15:40.065 --> 15:42.692
Oh, gosh.
No, it's just... weird.

15:42.692 --> 15:43.902
It's just creepy.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.153
It's like an addition to the,

15:45.653 --> 15:47.113
the back of the house
behind the kitchen,

15:47.113 --> 15:49.407
and it's always dirty.

15:49.407 --> 15:50.492
Okay. Alright.

15:50.492 --> 15:51.910
We, we can talk
back there

15:51.910 --> 15:53.453
if, if you're fine
going back there.

15:54.412 --> 15:56.748
- It's, uh...
- Yeah, we can go back there.

15:56.748 --> 16:00.543
Okay. Alright.
There's a, uh,
there's a back room there

16:00.543 --> 16:02.045
- that we can...
Kind of
like the laundry?

16:02.045 --> 16:03.046
...that she'd like to talk in.

16:03.046 --> 16:04.714
Yeah, that'll work.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.132
It's too hot
out here for...

16:06.132 --> 16:07.300
Oh, well,
I can make a pitstop

16:07.300 --> 16:10.095
and take out the AC
if you need that.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.889
Well, there's,
they've gotta do their thing

16:12.889 --> 16:14.015
for a minute,
and then we can go in.

16:14.015 --> 16:14.974
We can go in.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.393
Oh, get the password.

16:16.393 --> 16:18.186
Oh, what's the, uh,
how do you open this?

16:18.186 --> 16:19.604
- Uh--
- Just hang on.

16:21.064 --> 16:23.149
What kind is it?
An iPhone?

16:50.844 --> 16:52.178
How long you lived
in Augusta?

16:53.972 --> 16:56.683
Uh... I was out here

16:56.683 --> 17:00.812
October 2015
to April 2016,

17:01.104 --> 17:04.607
um, TDY, and then moved back
this past December.

17:04.816 --> 17:06.651
What do--
what do you think of it?

17:07.444 --> 17:09.946
Well, I willingly moved
back here as a civilian,

17:09.946 --> 17:11.156
so I guess
it must be alright.

17:11.156 --> 17:12.282
Willingly.

17:12.282 --> 17:13.783
You say that,
you say that begrudgingly.

17:14.284 --> 17:16.953
Yeah. I, I mean,
originally, I--

17:17.287 --> 17:20.123
My big plan is to deploy
as a Pashto linguist

17:20.123 --> 17:21.416
and be in Bagram
for a bit.

17:21.416 --> 17:24.127
But then they hired me
out here for Farsi, so...

17:24.127 --> 17:26.004
Wait, you're-you're
Farsi and Pashto?

17:26.004 --> 17:28.089
Farsi, Dari, Pashto.

17:28.089 --> 17:29.758
Wow! That's...

17:29.758 --> 17:31.634
that's impressive.

17:32.260 --> 17:35.055
I can barely, I-I'm barely
able to speak English.

17:36.681 --> 17:37.682
English is hard.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.060
Hmm.

17:41.353 --> 17:43.480
Uh, but yeah,
I noticed that with--

17:47.192 --> 17:48.860
Especially here at Augusta,

17:48.860 --> 17:50.320
it's, uh,
it's great for families.

17:50.320 --> 17:53.448
But, uh, single, it's,
it's kind of tough.

17:53.448 --> 17:57.202
Like, I can't imagine
coming back.

17:57.202 --> 17:58.828
What's the, um...

17:59.162 --> 18:01.664
Do you, uh, do you have
a password or anything?

18:01.664 --> 18:04.084
- No password.
- How do we, how do we do it?

18:04.084 --> 18:05.585
Show me how to do it
or tell me how to do it.

18:05.585 --> 18:06.711
Swipe that?

18:06.711 --> 18:08.254
Uh, yeah.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.547
No security?

18:10.048 --> 18:11.299
No security.

18:12.634 --> 18:14.469
You don't have a password
or anything that--

18:14.469 --> 18:16.763
No password. Nothing.
Just anytime it locks,

18:16.763 --> 18:19.599
- you just press
the side there...
- Okay.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.143
...until you see the circle
and just slide up a bit.

18:23.103 --> 18:24.396
Okay, so it...

18:27.357 --> 18:28.817
Did you already show her
the warrant?

18:30.318 --> 18:31.653
Uh, no, I haven't.

18:34.155 --> 18:37.158
I was going to. We're going to,
we're going to sit down
and show it to her.

18:51.256 --> 18:53.258
What made you
get out of the Air Force?

18:56.761 --> 18:59.264
I, I wanted to deploy.

19:00.181 --> 19:02.600
I mean, I learned Pashto
for a reason

19:02.600 --> 19:04.936
and those opportunities aren't
in the Air Force right now.

19:04.936 --> 19:06.187
Mm.

19:06.187 --> 19:07.480
You figure that
with that language,

19:07.480 --> 19:09.357
you could just
raise your hand and they'd go,

19:09.357 --> 19:11.109
- Right here!
-"Yeah, go."

19:11.609 --> 19:13.486
Yeah. No.
Where I was in Maryland,

19:13.486 --> 19:15.530
they only had one billet
per year for Afghanistan,

19:15.530 --> 19:17.657
and it was all
always airborne.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.075
Not even language.

19:19.409 --> 19:21.327
So I imagine people
are just crawling for it.

19:21.870 --> 19:24.664
Yeah. And I don't have
my airborne physical. So...

19:26.666 --> 19:28.084
Is your dog okay?

19:28.084 --> 19:29.961
- Does it need anything?
- She's fine.

19:30.420 --> 19:32.422
- She?
- Yeah, she's--

19:32.422 --> 19:34.591
If you can tell
we're all dog people.

19:37.052 --> 19:38.636
Yeah, I can,
I can tell.

19:44.476 --> 19:45.685
Is she destructive at all

19:45.685 --> 19:47.604
when she, when you
leave her alone?

19:47.604 --> 19:50.190
Yeah, she's just
a nervous chewer.

19:53.193 --> 19:54.152
Whoa!

20:11.461 --> 20:12.796
Where do you CrossFit at?

20:15.382 --> 20:18.885
Uh, I'm at SEC.

20:19.511 --> 20:23.139
It used to be
on, uh, Enterprise Court...

20:23.139 --> 20:24.391
- Mm-hmm.
- ...off of Bobby Jones,

20:24.391 --> 20:26.351
and then we moved
to Wheeler.

20:28.645 --> 20:31.523
Uh, but my-my friend's
reopening the Under Box.

20:31.523 --> 20:34.275
You, you going to go off?

20:34.275 --> 20:35.985
Yeah. I'm just, I'm just
waiting for her gym

20:35.985 --> 20:37.654
to open to, to jump ship.

20:39.781 --> 20:41.324
I did it
for, like, six months,

20:41.324 --> 20:42.617
and I hurt myself.

20:42.617 --> 20:45.495
- Oh.
- Just every single day
was just pain.

20:45.495 --> 20:47.205
- Yeah.
- So, I don't know.

20:47.205 --> 20:49.332
I guess I'm just too old
and broken.

20:53.670 --> 20:56.214
Yeah, I always say that
I, I don't do CrossFit,

20:56.214 --> 20:57.590
- I do competitive powerlifting.
Okay.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.509
And then I do CrossFit
when it's convenient.

20:59.509 --> 21:00.844
No. Uh-huh.

21:01.511 --> 21:03.972
What's your, uh...

21:03.972 --> 21:05.390
Powerlifting?

21:07.142 --> 21:09.185
What's your,
y-your preference on?

21:09.185 --> 21:11.062
What's your favorite stuff?

21:11.062 --> 21:14.482
Oh, I'm just
all upper body.

21:15.025 --> 21:16.526
So, bench.

21:16.526 --> 21:18.486
It's kind of sad.
I tested my lifts this week

21:18.486 --> 21:20.363
because I have a competition
on June 24th,

21:20.363 --> 21:24.367
and my max bench is 180,
and then my max back squat--

21:24.367 --> 21:26.202
I have a,
I have a back injury,

21:26.202 --> 21:28.455
so my max back squat is 195.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.331
- But I don't--
- Still!

21:30.331 --> 21:31.750
Still not shabby.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.918
No, it should not be
that close.

21:33.918 --> 21:35.587
How'd you hurt
your back?

21:37.881 --> 21:39.674
Uh, doing power cleans.

21:39.674 --> 21:42.427
My, uh, pelvis
wasn't rotating,

21:42.427 --> 21:45.013
so I separated that joint.

21:45.013 --> 21:46.639
- Sounds painful.
Yeah.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.184
I did, um,
I was doing box jumps

21:49.184 --> 21:50.560
and this hand just...

21:50.560 --> 21:53.438
I was doing it by myself.
It hit the box.

21:53.438 --> 21:57.108
And, I-I mean, I thought
I just fractured every bone

21:57.108 --> 22:00.278
in the body,
in the, in the hand.

22:00.862 --> 22:03.490
And I went to, I had to go
to the doctor to get the x-ray.

22:03.490 --> 22:06.201
They said,
"So how did you do this?"
CrossFit.

22:06.201 --> 22:08.036
Four times they asked me.

22:08.036 --> 22:10.663
I said, "No, I didn't get
in a fight. It was CrossFit."

22:13.458 --> 22:14.793
I, I, um,
I thought I could see

22:14.793 --> 22:16.920
the bone on my shin
from that one.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.463
Wow. What was that?

22:18.463 --> 22:20.924
Box jumps.
Just missed the box.

22:20.924 --> 22:23.259
That's a moment
you really hope,
did anybody see that?

22:23.259 --> 22:25.470
I really hope
nobody saw that.

22:42.445 --> 22:44.989
So I do have
to ask just

22:46.074 --> 22:48.827
however this goes,
and I don't want to make
any assumptions,

22:48.827 --> 22:52.247
but this is going to be
a thing where, like,

22:52.247 --> 22:53.707
I brought my phone
into the building

22:53.707 --> 22:56.001
and I don't see that phone
for three weeks or...

22:56.876 --> 22:58.962
- So, we'll go over the--
- So, we have a warrant
for the phone.

22:58.962 --> 23:00.255
Yeah, no, and I don't,
I don't want to make

23:00.255 --> 23:01.798
any assumptions
or anything like that.

23:01.798 --> 23:02.924
Just, uh...

23:03.591 --> 23:06.636
I'm, I'm teaching
yoga tomorrow,

23:06.636 --> 23:08.680
and my phone has
the music on it.

23:17.313 --> 23:18.690
Okay.

23:20.108 --> 23:23.236
I mean, there are...
bigger problems in the world.

23:23.236 --> 23:25.113
So I, I can make do,
I guess.

23:25.113 --> 23:29.200
Yeah. And, uh, we'll, we'll talk
about that once we sit down.

23:29.701 --> 23:32.454
Is there, uh, do you have
just a few chairs?

23:32.454 --> 23:34.998
Like, kitchen table chairs
we can pull into that,

23:34.998 --> 23:37.625
that back room
or are we gonna be
sitting on the floor?

23:37.625 --> 23:39.544
No. Uh...

23:40.128 --> 23:44.674
yeah, if you want to sit.
I'm not too big on furniture.

24:38.395 --> 24:40.230
Would it be too much
to ask if I can get

24:40.230 --> 24:42.065
the cat on a leash
and tied up?

24:42.065 --> 24:43.858
Just, um...

24:45.318 --> 24:48.196
I just don't want to be, like,
asking someone in the FBI

24:48.196 --> 24:51.449
to keep the front door closed
if you guys are doing a search.

24:51.449 --> 24:53.535
I don't see,
I don't see an issue.

24:53.535 --> 24:56.788
Uh, uh, where is
the cat right now?

24:56.788 --> 24:58.289
- In the bedroom.
- Uh, on the bed.

24:58.289 --> 24:59.416
In the bed.

24:59.416 --> 25:02.293
- Okay.
- Still in the bed?

25:02.293 --> 25:03.253
Yeah, I think so.

25:11.136 --> 25:13.596
Where... um,
just safety's sake,

25:13.596 --> 25:15.932
where are the, uh...
there's your weapon
and the--

25:15.932 --> 25:17.934
The weapon, it's right by
the little table

25:17.934 --> 25:19.894
with the lamp
right under the bed.

25:20.395 --> 25:21.730
Your cat's under there.

25:21.730 --> 25:24.357
He's under the bed,
or she's under the bed.

25:25.025 --> 25:26.776
The AR is
in the case in here?

25:26.776 --> 25:27.569
Yes.

25:27.569 --> 25:28.903
Where's the other gun?

25:28.903 --> 25:30.530
It's behind it,
more against the wall

25:30.530 --> 25:31.614
in the black case.

25:31.614 --> 25:33.199
Can you get your cat?

25:33.199 --> 25:34.951
- Do you want to get your cat?
Can you...

25:34.951 --> 25:36.286
Do you want to get your cat?

25:36.286 --> 25:37.412
Do you want
to get your cat?

25:37.412 --> 25:38.705
Just-- Get your cat.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.152
<i>Alright. She's good.</i>

26:09.152 --> 26:11.529
(sighs) <i>Okay.</i>
<i>Alright.</i>

26:12.030 --> 26:13.948
<i>
Uh, you wanna go back here?</i>

26:13.948 --> 26:16.284
<i>Yeah, you can go ahead
and go back in there.</i>

26:57.075 --> 26:59.744
This room is dirty.
I'm so sorry.

27:13.425 --> 27:14.759
Alrighty.

27:16.720 --> 27:19.597
So, uh, again,
my name is Justin.

27:20.140 --> 27:22.058
You probably
don't re-remember
any idea of who I am.

27:22.058 --> 27:25.103
So, Justin Garrick
with the FBI.

27:25.562 --> 27:27.939
Uh, this is Wally.
He's my partner.

27:28.565 --> 27:30.275
Um, so what I want to do
is kind of explain

27:30.275 --> 27:32.402
that, you know, we do have
a search warrant.

27:33.069 --> 27:34.446
Uh, you're welcome
to see the warrant.

27:34.446 --> 27:35.864
You're welcome
to read the warrant.

27:35.864 --> 27:37.532
And then explain
a little bit about it.

27:37.532 --> 27:40.493
Now, if you're willing
to talk to me,

27:40.994 --> 27:43.830
I'd like to kind of go through
just how this started

27:43.830 --> 27:46.249
and, you know,
give your, your side of it.

27:46.249 --> 27:48.126
We'll figure out
what's going on here.

27:48.126 --> 27:51.129
Does that sound, uh,
sound good to you?

27:53.381 --> 27:54.674
Okay.

27:56.176 --> 27:57.260
Okay?

27:59.512 --> 28:00.805
Yes.

28:02.349 --> 28:04.017
Now I'm
gonna take, uh...

28:05.602 --> 28:06.603
Right here.

28:06.978 --> 28:09.314
I'm gonna take,
uh, notes,

28:09.939 --> 28:11.649
uh, just random basis.

28:11.649 --> 28:12.692
You gotta take notes.

28:17.489 --> 28:18.740
Now, do you need water
or anything?

28:18.740 --> 28:20.450
Ar-are you thirsty?

28:23.203 --> 28:25.163
You're what?
If you need water,
shout it out.

28:27.040 --> 28:30.251
Uh... okay.
I'll let you know. Thanks.

28:31.294 --> 28:32.545
Are you thirsty?

28:32.545 --> 28:34.005
Uh, not right now.

28:34.214 --> 28:35.715
Okay. Alright.

28:37.967 --> 28:39.427
Um, if you need
to use the restroom,

28:39.427 --> 28:40.470
any of that, let me know.

28:40.470 --> 28:42.639
It's not a big deal. Okay?

28:43.306 --> 28:45.642
Okay. So currently,
you're employed

28:45.642 --> 28:48.353
as a contract, uh, linguist

28:48.353 --> 28:50.397
with Pluribus?

28:50.980 --> 28:51.981
Yes.

28:51.981 --> 28:54.234
I'm sorry, what languages
you said?

28:54.234 --> 28:55.402
Um, I-I heard...

28:55.402 --> 28:57.362
Uh, Farsi, Dari, Pashto.

29:01.408 --> 29:02.659
Okay.

29:02.659 --> 29:04.119
Any other?

29:07.163 --> 29:09.499
- No.
I'm kidding.

29:10.583 --> 29:11.876
I think that's enough.

29:13.169 --> 29:14.713
That's really impressive.

29:14.713 --> 29:17.382
Uh, and you live here,
uh, sorry, by yourself?

29:18.842 --> 29:21.177
- Yes.
Okay.

29:22.846 --> 29:25.056
It's really hard
without a table and chairs.

29:27.017 --> 29:29.227
- I-I'm so sorry.
- It's...

29:29.853 --> 29:32.022
You don't have to apol--
It's your house.

29:33.064 --> 29:34.941
Um, if you do feel like,
you know,

29:34.941 --> 29:36.985
you want to sit
or anything, we'll sit.

29:36.985 --> 29:38.737
Okay? I mean,
if you sit on the floor,

29:38.737 --> 29:39.988
I'll sit on the floor,
I don't care.

29:39.988 --> 29:41.406
- Hmm?
Mm-hmm.

29:42.699 --> 29:43.950
Okay.

29:45.076 --> 29:46.745
Um, and I'm serious
about that.

29:46.745 --> 29:47.746
If you want to sit, please.

29:47.746 --> 29:49.289
I'll, I'll sit down too.

29:51.374 --> 29:52.751
Okay.

29:52.751 --> 29:54.461
Um, so, again.

29:54.461 --> 29:56.338
We have a warrant,

29:56.338 --> 29:57.756
and it's...
do you...

29:57.756 --> 29:59.507
Would you like to see it?

30:00.592 --> 30:02.927
- Yes, please.
Okay.

30:05.305 --> 30:06.890
That just gave us
the authority to search

30:06.890 --> 30:08.933
the residence,
the car, and then you.

30:17.734 --> 30:20.570
125 pounds.
You guys flatter me.

30:23.615 --> 30:25.450
Sorry, I have
a sense of humor.

30:25.450 --> 30:28.203
- That was on your
driver's license.
That's right.

30:29.913 --> 30:31.623
Okay, well, I lied.

30:32.749 --> 30:34.250
Don't we all?

30:36.252 --> 30:38.672
Attachment "B"
just explains the property

30:38.672 --> 30:40.757
- that we're authorized
to search for and seize.

30:40.757 --> 30:42.467
Any questions
about any of that?

30:44.552 --> 30:45.553
Um...

30:48.431 --> 30:49.474
No.

30:49.683 --> 30:50.642
Okay.

30:51.142 --> 30:53.186
We'll just leave
a copy of that for you.

30:53.770 --> 30:55.313
Yeah, we'll leave a copy.

31:33.768 --> 31:35.270
<i>So, uh,</i>

31:35.270 --> 31:37.647
<i>all this stems from
a report that we received</i>

31:37.647 --> 31:40.650
<i>that you had mishandled
classified information.</i>

31:41.693 --> 31:43.987
<i>Uh, my, uh, question is,</i>

31:43.987 --> 31:46.406
<i>does that ring any bells
to you whatsoever?</i>

31:53.079 --> 31:56.166
It-it does now. Um...

31:56.166 --> 31:59.127
When I started working
at White Law, I...

32:00.962 --> 32:03.048
- Do you guys know PKI passwords?
Mm-hmm.

32:03.506 --> 32:07.093
So I had a printed-out email,
and I put it in a folder.

32:07.093 --> 32:09.679
I didn't have a desk yet,
so I, I took it with me

32:09.679 --> 32:12.265
and passed through security
and went to Starbucks.

32:12.265 --> 32:16.019
And when I came back,
they searched through it.

32:16.019 --> 32:17.520
And unfortunately,

32:17.520 --> 32:20.148
the email I had printed out
was classified,

32:20.148 --> 32:22.025
and, uh, they, they
filed a report for that.

32:22.025 --> 32:23.360
Okay. Alright.

32:23.360 --> 32:25.028
And, uh, what's
your work role there

32:25.028 --> 32:26.154
at, at White Law?

32:26.571 --> 32:30.617
Currently, I translate
graphics documents,
and, um...

32:32.327 --> 32:34.412
- Yeah, that's all I do.
Okay.

32:34.871 --> 32:36.164
From Farsi to English.

32:36.998 --> 32:40.210
So you're assigned
to a specific section,

32:40.210 --> 32:41.544
- I guess, or group?
Yes.

32:41.544 --> 32:44.714
Uh, it's the Iranian
Aerospace Forces Office.

32:44.714 --> 32:47.300
Have you been assigned there
your entire time there?

32:47.676 --> 32:49.219
Yes, since February.

32:50.720 --> 32:51.763
Okay.

32:51.763 --> 32:53.139
Uh, is there
any other issues

32:53.139 --> 32:55.058
or anything you're aware of
that might explain

32:55.058 --> 32:56.851
why that report
was generated?

32:56.851 --> 33:00.021
Like, ah, maybe this,
maybe that.

33:00.980 --> 33:02.232
No.

33:03.650 --> 33:04.734
No. Okay.

33:05.235 --> 33:08.905
Um, so you currently hold
Top Secret/SCI clearance?

33:08.905 --> 33:10.240
Yes.

33:11.408 --> 33:14.035
How long have you had that?

33:14.035 --> 33:18.832
Uh, I would say
since January 2013.

33:19.165 --> 33:21.376
- While you were
in the Air Force?
Yes.

33:22.627 --> 33:24.129
So you kept it through...

33:26.589 --> 33:27.632
through the...

33:28.383 --> 33:29.467
Did you...

33:30.635 --> 33:33.596
<i>I guess when you left
the Air Force,
you kept the...</i>

33:33.596 --> 33:34.639
<i>When did you lea--</i>

33:35.265 --> 33:37.392
When did you process
out of the Air Force?

33:37.392 --> 33:39.894
Uh, I processed out
of the Air Force,

33:39.894 --> 33:42.022
um, December,

33:42.022 --> 33:46.067
uh, December 14th, um, 2016.

33:46.067 --> 33:48.570
And up until that time,
I was looking for contracts

33:48.570 --> 33:50.488
to try and get
my clearance renewed.

33:50.488 --> 33:52.991
So your, uh, clearance
just kind of passed through?

33:52.991 --> 33:54.701
It passed through. Yeah.

33:57.203 --> 33:58.621
Okay. Alright.

33:58.997 --> 34:02.500
Um, so, again,
as far as you're aware,

34:02.500 --> 34:04.836
you haven't committed
any security violations

34:04.836 --> 34:06.212
or anything you're aware of

34:06.212 --> 34:08.089
other than this, this

34:08.089 --> 34:10.175
PKI thing?

34:10.175 --> 34:13.511
Other than
the PKI thing, no.

34:20.935 --> 34:22.228
I mean...

34:23.605 --> 34:27.442
I-I do print out
documents at work

34:27.442 --> 34:30.987
because it's easier for me
to translate them by hand.

34:30.987 --> 34:33.448
Hmm.
But then
I put them in the box,

34:33.448 --> 34:35.158
and then I don't
get it mixed up

34:35.158 --> 34:37.118
with, like, my,
my classified notes

34:37.118 --> 34:38.578
because they, uh...

34:40.205 --> 34:42.791
I use pretty paper.

34:43.416 --> 34:45.627
<i>So I don't take out
white paper.</i>

34:47.587 --> 34:49.547
Mm. Got it.

34:50.131 --> 34:51.549
An-and I know it sounds
really dumb,

34:51.549 --> 34:55.261
but it's just, uh,
it's how I can do it now.

34:55.720 --> 34:58.807
And after this stupid
PKI thing, I was like,

34:58.807 --> 35:01.601
no more white paper
out of the building.

35:01.601 --> 35:04.646
You, you said
you printed out stuff.

35:04.646 --> 35:06.022
Yeah, I printed out--

35:06.022 --> 35:07.524
Is there a, a...

35:07.524 --> 35:10.443
why did that come to mind
as far as security?

35:14.406 --> 35:15.657
I guess

35:16.282 --> 35:18.785
I'm, um, just trying
to think about

35:19.911 --> 35:21.121
actual paper.

35:21.705 --> 35:23.748
Um, I can't imagine
any other way

35:23.748 --> 35:26.418
to get things out
of the building, I guess.

35:26.710 --> 35:30.380
I mean, I-I'm old fashioned,
so thinking about that.

35:30.380 --> 35:34.467
And
just with this PKI thing,

35:34.467 --> 35:36.177
just making sure I don't
accidentally have anything

35:36.177 --> 35:37.721
in my lunch box
or anything like--

35:37.721 --> 35:39.556
Nothing got
out of the building?
- Nothing.

35:39.556 --> 35:41.391
You didn't carry anything
out of the building?

35:41.391 --> 35:44.602
No. No. And I definitely
let everything get searched
all the time.

35:44.602 --> 35:47.188
So I haven't had
any other accidents.

35:50.025 --> 35:51.609
Do you work
on any other matters?

35:52.027 --> 35:52.944
No.

35:52.944 --> 35:54.279
Okay.

35:55.488 --> 35:58.575
Have you ever inadvertently,
either by accident

35:58.575 --> 36:00.744
or, or intentionally
or whatever,

36:00.744 --> 36:04.622
uh, gone outside your
need to know on items?

36:05.165 --> 36:08.501
Outside my
need to know on items?

36:08.501 --> 36:09.627
Um...

36:11.087 --> 36:13.256
I do from time to time

36:13.256 --> 36:15.300
look at a website
called My Online.

36:15.675 --> 36:18.636
- It's, uh, drone feeds.
Okay.

36:18.636 --> 36:22.223
I used to work a drone mission,
so it's all Afghan stuff.

36:22.223 --> 36:25.226
But other than that,
just, uh...

36:26.269 --> 36:28.897
reading basic
news articles on NSA Net.

36:28.897 --> 36:31.066
But I've never accessed
anything that's outside of--

36:31.066 --> 36:34.194
Okay. Have you ever
gone searching for stuff

36:34.194 --> 36:37.364
that's not related to your,
uh, your work role?

36:37.364 --> 36:38.490
No.

36:39.074 --> 36:40.450
Okay.

36:42.535 --> 36:43.870
You kind of already
answered this.

36:43.870 --> 36:48.124
But outside of the PKI,
have you ever taken anything

36:48.124 --> 36:50.960
outside of the,
uh, uh, the NSA facility?

36:50.960 --> 36:52.712
- No.
No?

36:52.712 --> 36:55.382
Uh, have you
downloaded anything?
Emailed anything out?

36:55.382 --> 36:57.759
- No.
No? Okay.

36:57.759 --> 37:00.428
Have you ever discussed,
uh, any classified material

37:00.428 --> 37:01.638
with anybody
who wouldn't have

37:01.638 --> 37:03.932
the, uh, prior
US government authorization?

37:03.932 --> 37:05.809
Who wouldn't have the clearance
or anything like that?

37:05.809 --> 37:07.977
Who wouldn't have the clearance
and the need to know?

37:07.977 --> 37:09.354
No.

37:10.021 --> 37:12.482
No? Okay.

37:13.149 --> 37:16.194
Not many people ask
about Iranian aerospace,

37:16.194 --> 37:18.697
so, uh... I lucked out.

37:19.322 --> 37:21.157
So you never discussed,
uh, discussed work

37:21.157 --> 37:22.992
or anything classified
with anybody?

37:25.662 --> 37:26.705
Uh-uh.

37:29.541 --> 37:31.001
How's the neighborhood?

37:34.838 --> 37:37.465
I, I did not look at a map
when I signed the lease.

37:37.465 --> 37:40.510
But I am well armed.

37:40.510 --> 37:42.429
- You seem to be.

37:42.429 --> 37:43.888
What's your plans?

37:43.888 --> 37:45.181
You gonna stay in the house

37:45.181 --> 37:46.307
or you gonna move
somewhere else or...

37:46.307 --> 37:48.184
Di-did you sign
a lease, I guess?

37:48.184 --> 37:50.353
I signed a lease,
and I would only break it

37:50.353 --> 37:51.354
if I get a deployment.

37:51.354 --> 37:52.564
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

37:53.064 --> 37:56.192
Have you had any issues here
since you moved here?

37:56.192 --> 37:57.902
I did, yeah.

37:57.902 --> 37:59.029
What happened?

37:59.612 --> 38:03.491
I was coming home from a concert
in Atlanta and it was 3:00 a.m.,

38:03.491 --> 38:08.329
and, uh, there was a, a guy
standing on the street.

38:08.329 --> 38:10.915
And I wanted to make sure
that he didn't see me go

38:10.915 --> 38:12.375
from like my car
to my, my door.

38:12.375 --> 38:14.002
And I thought
I'd timed it out well.

38:14.002 --> 38:16.421
But then I was standing
at the sink getting water

38:16.421 --> 38:18.214
and then someone starts knocking
at the door and I was like--

38:20.633 --> 38:22.927
- Do you have a toothpick?
Huh?

38:29.100 --> 38:31.394
Uh, it's, uh, 3:00 a.m.,

38:31.394 --> 38:34.731
and, uh, my-my-my keys
and my phone were by the door

38:34.731 --> 38:36.358
'cause that's where
I dropped them,

38:36.358 --> 38:38.068
'cause I had to pee,
so, uh,

38:38.902 --> 38:41.571
very glad to have a,
a Glock Nine in the back.

38:41.571 --> 38:42.906
Oh, yeah.

38:42.906 --> 38:43.782
Did not sleep.

38:43.782 --> 38:45.116
I'm sure.

38:46.618 --> 38:48.328
Anything other than that?

38:50.038 --> 38:52.499
Other than that? Um...

38:54.084 --> 38:55.418
There's this...

38:55.960 --> 38:59.673
People always ask
if you want your lawn done.

38:59.673 --> 39:02.300
And, uh, someone came
and mowed my lawn

39:02.300 --> 39:03.760
while I was
in Belize last week,

39:03.760 --> 39:06.221
so, uh, not really cool
with that.

39:06.221 --> 39:07.972
- I imagine not.
- Yeah.

39:07.972 --> 39:09.224
They're probably
gonna come by,

39:09.224 --> 39:10.642
knock on the door,
and ask for compensation.

39:10.642 --> 39:12.060
Yeah.

39:12.060 --> 39:13.269
I mean,
if it's the same guy

39:13.269 --> 39:14.437
I paid last time,

39:14.437 --> 39:16.314
he's like this
little old man,

39:16.314 --> 39:19.109
like, in his 80s,
so I won't really be mad.

39:19.109 --> 39:21.194
- But--
- When, uh,

39:21.194 --> 39:23.029
when did you go
to Belize?

39:24.572 --> 39:28.118
I left on Saturday morning
and flew back

39:28.118 --> 39:29.703
Monday morning, uh,

39:30.453 --> 39:31.746
last weekend.

39:33.248 --> 39:34.457
That was a quick trip
to Belize.

39:37.168 --> 39:38.670
It was a quick trip.

39:39.212 --> 39:40.630
What you go down there for?

39:40.630 --> 39:44.050
I wanted to see
the Mayan pyramids.

39:44.050 --> 39:45.176
Okay.

39:45.176 --> 39:46.761
<i>So, yeah.</i>

39:46.761 --> 39:48.555
<i>That's pretty cool.</i>

39:48.555 --> 39:50.098
I-I didn't have any leave,

39:50.098 --> 39:53.601
so I was tired of waiting
for the stars to align.

39:53.601 --> 39:55.645
- So I just said...
Sure.

39:55.645 --> 39:57.272
...got three days,
let's do it.

39:57.272 --> 39:58.606
That's cool.
Fair enough.

39:58.606 --> 40:00.692
Spur of the moment,
that's pretty cool.

40:01.651 --> 40:03.695
Did you go down there
by yourself or...

40:04.362 --> 40:06.531
Yeah, by myself.

40:06.531 --> 40:08.324
Okay. Did you

40:08.324 --> 40:10.493
do any tours or anything
down there?

40:11.119 --> 40:12.162
I did.

40:12.162 --> 40:14.289
Um, I...

40:14.289 --> 40:16.416
The, the first day,
I went on, like,

40:16.416 --> 40:18.668
a Altun Ha tour.

40:18.668 --> 40:21.254
Uh... that was one of
the first sites.

40:21.254 --> 40:24.257
And then the second day,
we did, um,

40:24.257 --> 40:26.259
uh, we took a boat
on a river

40:26.259 --> 40:27.719
down to the Lamanai pyramids.

40:27.719 --> 40:29.137
And then we came back and...

40:30.972 --> 40:32.140
Yeah.

40:33.433 --> 40:35.226
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

40:36.102 --> 40:37.896
Saw a bunch of monkeys.

40:39.064 --> 40:42.442
So you're positive you've
never printed anything out

40:42.442 --> 40:44.569
that was outside
of your work role?

40:49.032 --> 40:50.867
Uh, I'm trying to think.

40:50.867 --> 40:51.993
Um...

40:52.911 --> 40:54.120
uh...

40:54.120 --> 40:57.040
because there's, um, there's,

40:57.040 --> 40:58.500
there's NSA Pulse,

40:58.500 --> 41:01.920
and, uh, from time to time,
I, I do print out articles

41:02.587 --> 41:05.632
from that and use
as scratch paper.

41:05.632 --> 41:08.468
Uh, th-that sounds
really dumb.

41:08.468 --> 41:10.720
Uh, (laughs) now that
I'm thinking about it,

41:10.720 --> 41:13.640
the things that I, I did
were r-r-r-really dumb, uh.

41:13.640 --> 41:16.017
But then, I always threw it out
in the burn bin.

41:16.017 --> 41:17.268
Okay.

41:17.268 --> 41:18.895
<i>What kind of articles
from Pulse do you pull out?</i>

41:20.689 --> 41:23.024
<i>Uh, usually reference
material about, like...</i>

41:24.484 --> 41:26.778
<i>...uh, just making sure,
like, so many references</i>

41:26.778 --> 41:28.822
<i>that I keep having
to re-look up,</i>

41:28.822 --> 41:32.701
so that's probably
a fraud, waste,
and abuse right there.

41:32.701 --> 41:35.203
We're not worried about
fraud, waste, and abuse.

41:36.079 --> 41:37.163
Okay.

41:37.163 --> 41:38.289
No.

41:40.667 --> 41:42.752
I use a lot of papers,

41:42.752 --> 41:46.715
but nothing outside
of Iranian stuff or anything

41:46.715 --> 41:49.342
other than that, and never
outside of the building.

41:49.342 --> 41:50.552
Okay.

41:51.136 --> 41:52.220
Reality,

41:52.971 --> 41:55.015
what if I said that I have
the information

41:55.015 --> 41:56.766
to suggest that
you did print out stuff

41:56.766 --> 41:58.643
that was outside
of that scope?

42:02.230 --> 42:03.982
I mean, I would...

42:04.816 --> 42:06.234
I would try to remember.

42:07.485 --> 42:08.528
Okay.

42:08.528 --> 42:09.654
What if I said

42:09.654 --> 42:12.282
that you
printed out information

42:12.282 --> 42:14.367
related to, uh,
reports on--

42:22.125 --> 42:23.168
Reality?

42:24.336 --> 42:25.587
Uh...

42:25.587 --> 42:27.672
we obviously know
a lot more than,

42:27.672 --> 42:29.591
than what we're
telling you at this point.

42:30.967 --> 42:32.719
And I think, I think
you know a lot more

42:32.719 --> 42:34.512
than what you're telling us
at this point.

42:35.221 --> 42:37.599
I don't want you
to go down the wrong road.

42:37.599 --> 42:40.018
I think you need to, to stop

42:40.018 --> 42:42.645
and think about
what you're saying

42:42.645 --> 42:43.980
and what you're doing.

42:44.647 --> 42:47.275
I think it-it-it's an,
an opportunity

42:47.275 --> 42:48.526
to maybe tell the truth.

42:48.526 --> 42:50.653
Because t-telling a,

42:50.653 --> 42:53.823
telling a lie
to an FBI agent

42:53.823 --> 42:55.700
is not going to be
the right thing.

42:56.451 --> 42:57.369
Okay?

42:57.369 --> 42:59.913
Uh, you know,
uh, again,

43:00.705 --> 43:02.916
we're here voluntarily.

43:02.916 --> 43:05.794
You're talking voluntarily.

43:06.127 --> 43:09.506
I'm not asking you,
forcing you to do anything

43:09.506 --> 43:10.799
but think.

43:11.341 --> 43:14.135
That-that-that's what
I'm asking you to do is think.

43:15.553 --> 43:17.305
So...

43:17.305 --> 43:19.516
think about
what he just asked you

43:19.849 --> 43:21.142
and let, you know...

43:32.362 --> 43:33.822
There's one
I, uh, printed out

43:33.822 --> 43:35.365
because I wanted to read it.

43:40.954 --> 43:42.872
Can you remember
what day that was?

43:44.165 --> 43:46.751
I might mess up
the dates, but, um...

43:47.836 --> 43:51.089
late, late March,
early, uh...

43:52.173 --> 43:54.342
- early April.
And what was it?

43:56.094 --> 43:58.054
It was an
NSA Pulse article about--

44:02.600 --> 44:05.020
Okay.
- And, uh...

44:06.312 --> 44:07.647
I did print that one out.

44:10.442 --> 44:11.401
Okay.

44:12.694 --> 44:14.404
Why...

44:14.904 --> 44:16.322
Why did you print
that one out?

44:17.949 --> 44:20.493
Um, because I wanted
to read it.

44:20.493 --> 44:23.580
Uh, the way
I, I downloaded it,
it was hard to read,

44:23.580 --> 44:25.206
so, um...

44:25.206 --> 44:27.125
uh, just,

44:27.125 --> 44:29.627
it looked like
a, a piece of history,
you know?

44:29.627 --> 44:32.088
And I, I wanted it on my desk
for, like, a day.

44:33.214 --> 44:35.091
Did you, uh...
H-how did you find it?

44:36.760 --> 44:38.762
Uh, so if you go
on Pulse,

44:38.762 --> 44:40.930
there's a...

44:40.930 --> 44:43.433
uh, the top right,
they have a tab

44:43.433 --> 44:46.644
that says "articles,"
and I, I scroll through those.

44:46.644 --> 44:48.772
Uh...

44:48.772 --> 44:49.856
I don't know
if you guys saw the one

44:49.856 --> 44:51.941
about the
miniature ponies, but...

44:51.941 --> 44:53.318
- We missed that one.
Yeah.

44:53.318 --> 44:54.527
No, that was,

44:54.527 --> 44:55.862
uh, that was number one
for, like, a year,

44:55.862 --> 44:57.739
so obviously I go
to check to see

44:57.739 --> 44:58.907
if there's any other gems.

44:58.907 --> 45:01.034
And then there was,
there was that one,

45:01.034 --> 45:04.120
and I saw it on the news
and I was just like,

45:04.120 --> 45:06.915
yeah, I, uh,
I wanted to read it.

45:07.749 --> 45:09.167
So, yeah.

45:09.709 --> 45:11.378
- Okay.
- What did you do
with the article?

45:11.961 --> 45:15.173
I kept it on my desk
for, like, three days.

45:20.512 --> 45:21.930
I'm going to be honest.

45:25.183 --> 45:27.185
I only read, like,
half of it.

45:28.019 --> 45:30.063
It was the stupidest thing ever.

45:30.063 --> 45:31.815
Uh, and then, and then
I burned bagged it

45:31.815 --> 45:34.484
in the box with the slat,
uh, next to the fridge.

45:35.110 --> 45:38.196
Okay. Uh, did you
print out any other articles?

45:38.196 --> 45:40.490
No, no, I just,
just, only the one.

45:40.490 --> 45:42.158
Okay.

45:42.158 --> 45:43.243
Talking around it.

45:43.993 --> 45:46.204
You're pretty sure it was
late April, early March.

45:46.204 --> 45:47.997
Think about, uh,
try to remember, like,

45:47.997 --> 45:49.207
details in your personal life.

45:49.207 --> 45:52.419
I know! I-I'm trying.
I d-- I don't...

45:52.419 --> 45:53.712
<i>I don't,
I don't remember.</i>

45:53.712 --> 45:55.547
<i>Um, I got in a fight</i>

45:55.547 --> 45:58.341
<i>with the boyfriend that week.</i>

45:58.341 --> 46:00.844
God,
when did I break up with him?
I-I don't remember.

46:01.428 --> 46:03.513
God, I'm, I'm really
blanking on what week,

46:03.513 --> 46:05.306
what the, what the weekend
was like before that.

46:05.306 --> 46:06.850
- I-I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

46:06.850 --> 46:09.310
Uh, I'm trying. God.

46:09.811 --> 46:12.689
Yeah. Mid-, mid-April
is all I'm thinking.

46:12.689 --> 46:13.732
Okay. Alright.

46:13.732 --> 46:15.358
What if I tell you
that I know

46:15.358 --> 46:17.527
that you searched for
and printed out a document

46:17.527 --> 46:19.237
on the ninth of May?

46:20.613 --> 46:21.990
The ninth of May?

46:23.241 --> 46:24.743
<i>Uh, let me see.</i>

46:25.285 --> 46:29.039
The CrossFit competition
was on the 12th.

46:29.998 --> 46:33.001
God, was it really that late?
Um...

46:33.001 --> 46:34.461
I-I-I mean,
I can't argue that.

46:34.461 --> 46:37.130
If-if you know, you know,
I mean, obviously you know.

46:37.130 --> 46:39.799
- I mean, I-I just,
I can't imagine.
- Okay, uh...

46:40.425 --> 46:43.428
I mean, I guess
we're already June already.

46:45.680 --> 46:48.141
It's, it's been a really
bad month for me.

46:48.141 --> 46:49.684
Do you remember what you did

46:49.684 --> 46:51.102
to get to that article?

46:52.228 --> 46:54.564
Other than seeing it
on the,

46:54.564 --> 46:55.774
on the front page
or linking it--

46:55.774 --> 46:57.650
Uh, do you remember
what search terms

46:57.650 --> 46:58.735
you might have put in?

47:08.078 --> 47:09.954
Probably--

47:12.582 --> 47:14.751
I'm not very sophisticated.

47:14.751 --> 47:16.419
Okay. So...

47:16.920 --> 47:18.588
you did print out
a document,

47:18.588 --> 47:20.590
uh, an intelligence report.

47:20.590 --> 47:22.092
Y-you do recall that?

47:22.926 --> 47:24.969
Yeah, I do remember now. Yeah.

47:25.345 --> 47:27.555
Okay. What did you do
with that report?

47:30.100 --> 47:32.769
I kept it on my desk
for three days,

47:32.769 --> 47:35.772
and, um, I thought
it was interesting
and I would read it.

47:35.772 --> 47:38.775
And then I said, no, I sh--
I should not have this
on my desk.

47:38.775 --> 47:40.485
And so I put it
in the burn bag.

47:40.485 --> 47:41.986
Where's the burn bag?

47:42.445 --> 47:44.072
Okay, uh,

47:44.072 --> 47:46.449
it's in the, uh, break room.

47:47.075 --> 47:50.412
Uh, it's the white box
with the little slat on it,

47:50.412 --> 47:51.371
one over from the fridge.

47:51.371 --> 47:53.581
So you just
slide it in there and--

47:53.581 --> 47:55.291
- And it's taken care of?
- Yeah.

47:57.293 --> 47:59.045
Okay, Reality...

48:00.130 --> 48:01.798
are you sure that's what
you did with it?

48:01.798 --> 48:03.091
Yes.

48:04.050 --> 48:05.385
You're positive?

48:06.302 --> 48:08.680
- Yes.
You didn't take it
out of the building?

48:08.680 --> 48:09.973
No.

48:09.973 --> 48:11.016
You didn't take it
out of the building

48:11.016 --> 48:12.142
and give it to anybody?

48:12.142 --> 48:13.977
- No.
You didn't send it?

48:13.977 --> 48:16.271
- No.
You didn't
send it to anyone?

48:16.271 --> 48:17.355
No.

48:18.231 --> 48:19.858
Reality, can you guess
how many people

48:19.858 --> 48:21.443
might have printed out
that article?

48:23.486 --> 48:24.696
No.

48:24.696 --> 48:26.281
It's not many.

48:26.781 --> 48:29.159
That article has made it
outside of NSA.

48:29.159 --> 48:31.703
Okay? Obviously,
because we're here.

48:33.288 --> 48:35.081
And the most likely candidate

48:35.081 --> 48:38.084
by far and away is you.

48:39.711 --> 48:41.463
So now,

48:41.463 --> 48:44.007
I-I-I don't think--

48:44.007 --> 48:45.175
I don't think you're a,
you know,

48:45.175 --> 48:48.011
a, a big bad master spy
or anything.

48:48.011 --> 48:50.055
Okay? I don't.
I don't think that.

48:50.055 --> 48:51.598
I think that I've looked
at the evidence,

48:51.598 --> 48:53.975
and it's compelling.

48:55.185 --> 48:56.895
Now, I'm not sure
why you did it,

48:56.895 --> 48:58.938
and I'm curious
as to that,

48:58.938 --> 49:00.190
but I think

49:00.190 --> 49:02.025
you might have been angry
over everything

49:02.025 --> 49:04.069
that's going on
politics-wise.

49:04.986 --> 49:06.446
Because you
can't turn on the...

49:07.405 --> 49:09.699
you can't turn on the TV
without getting pissed off.

49:10.575 --> 49:11.618
Or at least I can't.

49:13.078 --> 49:15.413
I think you might have
just made a mistake.

49:16.206 --> 49:18.166
Now, why I'm here
and why I want to talk to you

49:18.166 --> 49:20.669
is to figure out
the why behind this.

49:20.669 --> 49:22.545
Okay?

49:22.545 --> 49:24.964
So... I ask you again.

49:26.341 --> 49:28.009
Did you take it out
and send it?

49:30.512 --> 49:32.597
I... I didn't.

49:33.890 --> 49:35.725
I-I-I put it
in the burn bag.

49:35.725 --> 49:37.727
I mean,
I'm trying to deploy.

49:37.727 --> 49:39.771
I'm not trying to be
a whistleblower.
That's crazy.

49:39.771 --> 49:42.065
So how would
you think that a document
would end up getting out?

49:42.065 --> 49:44.317
Uh, I mean...

49:44.317 --> 49:45.735
I, I mean...

49:48.697 --> 49:50.198
Let's be honest, there's,

49:50.198 --> 49:53.159
there's little to no security
on the documents.

49:53.159 --> 49:55.120
- I mean, nobody pats you down.
Mm-hmm.

49:55.120 --> 49:56.746
We talk about it all the time
at work, like,

49:56.746 --> 49:57.872
"Oh, you have
to show our lunch.

49:57.872 --> 49:58.957
Oh, you eat so healthy,"

49:58.957 --> 50:00.709
like every day,
all the time.

50:00.709 --> 50:02.085
And people just, they...

50:02.085 --> 50:05.463
I mean, we, we have a building
full of geniuses, right?

50:05.463 --> 50:08.258
And, I mean,
I guess I'm just...

50:08.258 --> 50:10.301
I'm, I'm, I'm talking
and I'm nervous,

50:10.301 --> 50:12.971
but I-I didn't,
I didn't do anything with it.

50:13.596 --> 50:15.432
I mean, I-I'm trying
to go somewhere else.

50:15.432 --> 50:17.600
- I'm trying to increase
my clearance.
Okay.

50:17.600 --> 50:19.811
I mean, I-- and I know
it was sensitive

50:19.811 --> 50:21.062
and I thought it
would be cool to have

50:21.062 --> 50:22.313
on my desk
for a couple days.

50:22.313 --> 50:23.523
Okay. But do you remember,
you said you remember

50:23.523 --> 50:25.442
putting it in the,
in the, the burn bag.

50:25.442 --> 50:26.609
Yeah.
- Just sliding it in there.

50:26.609 --> 50:27.736
Okay.

50:27.736 --> 50:29.320
I remember that.
Folded in half.

50:30.780 --> 50:32.323
Folded in half?

50:35.660 --> 50:37.662
Yeah. Yeah, um...

50:38.621 --> 50:39.831
Because it didn't...

50:41.708 --> 50:43.126
Yeah, uh, folded in half.

50:45.420 --> 50:47.547
What if I tell you
that that document

50:48.465 --> 50:49.591
folded in half

50:50.342 --> 50:52.635
made its way
outside of NSA?

50:54.471 --> 50:56.306
- I, I don't, I don't--
Made its way out

50:56.306 --> 50:58.850
in an envelope
postmarked Augusta, Georgia.

50:59.642 --> 51:02.687
See, things are starting
to get a little specific.

51:05.190 --> 51:07.609
- Yeah.
Made its way
to an online news source

51:07.609 --> 51:09.277
that you subscribe to.

51:09.277 --> 51:11.071
Getting really specific.

51:13.490 --> 51:15.200
So I'm going
to ask you again.

51:20.246 --> 51:23.208
What is very, very...

51:24.542 --> 51:26.211
very compelling...

51:29.714 --> 51:31.007
I'd like to know
the reason

51:31.007 --> 51:33.385
because I, I-I don't think

51:33.385 --> 51:36.429
you make a habit
out of this at all.

51:36.429 --> 51:38.306
At all.

51:38.306 --> 51:41.643
I think you just...
messed up.

51:42.686 --> 51:44.187
Now, I'm not sure
why you did it,

51:44.187 --> 51:46.398
and I'd like to hear
from you on that.

51:47.399 --> 51:50.527
But the what and the how

51:50.527 --> 51:53.446
would you agree...
looks awfully bad?

51:55.031 --> 51:56.449
It looks really bad. Yeah.

51:58.451 --> 52:00.370
If you're angry
about what's going on,

52:01.371 --> 52:02.747
if there's anything that...

52:05.917 --> 52:07.544
Look, you've had
a good career.

52:07.544 --> 52:08.670
You have.

52:09.295 --> 52:11.589
If there's something
that just pushed you

52:11.589 --> 52:12.757
over the edge on this...

52:14.426 --> 52:16.136
now is the perfect time.

52:17.595 --> 52:18.763
This is a podium.

52:23.059 --> 52:24.936
You know,

52:24.936 --> 52:27.939
like... like he said,

52:29.274 --> 52:31.026
I, I don't think
we're coming in here to say

52:31.026 --> 52:34.821
you're some big, bad mastermind,
prolific spy kind of thing.

52:34.821 --> 52:38.575
I think what we both think is
that maybe you made a mistake.

52:38.575 --> 52:40.452
Maybe you weren't thinking
for a minute.

52:40.452 --> 52:42.328
Maybe you got angry,
like he said.

52:43.705 --> 52:46.291
I mean,
th-that's what I'm hoping.

52:47.083 --> 52:48.251
If th-that's the case,

52:48.251 --> 52:49.711
then that makes us feel
a little better

52:49.711 --> 52:54.424
knowing we don't have a,
a real serious problem here.

52:54.424 --> 52:57.385
You know, that's something
that concerns us, too.

52:58.094 --> 53:01.056
That, that this isn't
an, an ongoing problem.

53:01.681 --> 53:03.391
But we need
to figure it out.

53:03.391 --> 53:05.685
And if it was
a mistake...

53:07.312 --> 53:08.605
let's deal with it.

53:10.357 --> 53:11.941
Is this...

53:11.941 --> 53:13.526
is this a room?

53:15.278 --> 53:16.654
Agent 2:
Is that a room?

53:29.334 --> 53:31.252
So how'd you get it
out of the office?

53:49.646 --> 53:51.773
Folded in half
in my pantyhose.

54:06.746 --> 54:07.831
Okay.

54:09.040 --> 54:10.250
And what did you do
with it?

54:20.010 --> 54:22.679
I put it in an envelope
and sent it to--

54:22.679 --> 54:24.681
Anybody specifically there?

54:25.306 --> 54:27.142
I don't think I put a name.
I just put--

54:27.684 --> 54:29.686
Had you communicated with them
prior to you doing that? With--

54:29.686 --> 54:32.355
No, I wasn't trying to be
a Snowden or anything.

54:32.355 --> 54:33.982
And that's what--
I don't think you were either.

54:33.982 --> 54:35.275
I really don't.

54:35.275 --> 54:38.069
But I, I, I think
you made a mistake.

54:38.069 --> 54:40.238
But...

54:40.238 --> 54:41.698
I don't think
either one of us

54:41.698 --> 54:43.867
think you were trying
to be Snowden.

54:44.701 --> 54:47.620
No, it was, it was just
the one document.

54:47.620 --> 54:49.372
- And like you said, because...
Right.

54:49.372 --> 54:52.917
...I've had, um, a,
a really hard time at work.

54:52.917 --> 54:55.795
Uh, I've, I've, I've filed
formal complaints

54:55.795 --> 54:59.215
about them having
Fox News on all the time

54:59.215 --> 55:02.344
<i>and, and, like,
for God's sake,
put Al-Jazeera on</i>

55:02.344 --> 55:04.304
or a slideshow
of people's pets.

55:04.304 --> 55:05.597
Like, I've tried everything
to get that changed.

55:05.597 --> 55:07.015
It would probably
be a good thing.

55:07.015 --> 55:08.058
Unfortunately,
it doesn't matter

55:08.058 --> 55:09.059
which side you're watching,

55:09.059 --> 55:10.435
they're all pretty bad.

55:10.435 --> 55:12.187
-  Yeah.
But...

55:12.645 --> 55:15.732
<i>uh, I think the pets may be
the way to go.</i>

55:18.193 --> 55:19.944
<i>The pets
would have been great.</i>

55:20.779 --> 55:21.821
<i>Uhm...</i>

55:22.739 --> 55:25.075
<i>but just having that
every day and then--</i>

55:30.955 --> 55:32.624
Where'd you mail it from?

55:40.382 --> 55:42.258
Uh, mailbox

55:42.258 --> 55:45.178
on, uh, Baston Road.

55:45.178 --> 55:46.513
Okay.

55:46.513 --> 55:48.723
It's, uh, it's,
uh, the shopping center

55:48.723 --> 55:52.602
with the bank and
the Earth Fare
gro-gro-grocery store.

55:52.602 --> 55:54.145
Okay, I know
where you're talking about.

55:54.145 --> 55:56.022
At the intersection
of Baston Road

55:56.022 --> 55:57.482
and F-Fury's Ferry.

55:57.482 --> 55:58.775
Fury's Ferry. Okay.
Mm-hmm.

55:58.775 --> 56:01.945
I never could say that right.
Fur-Fury's Ferry.

56:01.945 --> 56:03.488
And it was just
a mailbox sittin' out

56:03.488 --> 56:05.198
in the middle
of the parking lot?

56:05.198 --> 56:06.950
<i>Mm-hmm.
Just a metal box, yeah.</i>

56:09.285 --> 56:11.037
- Okay.
Okay.

56:19.254 --> 56:20.672
Do you remember
what day it was?

56:22.507 --> 56:25.427
What day of the week
was the ninth?

56:26.011 --> 56:27.846
Let's see. Um...

56:27.846 --> 56:29.014
Uh, we'll check.

56:30.348 --> 56:31.683
Need some water
or something?

56:31.683 --> 56:33.268
I'd like some water
once we figure out

56:33.268 --> 56:34.310
what day of
the week it was.

56:34.310 --> 56:35.270
- Okay.
Let's see.

56:35.270 --> 56:37.230
I want to say
it was, uh,

56:37.230 --> 56:39.315
if I can figure out
this crazy phone,

56:39.315 --> 56:40.692
I want to say
it was a Tuesday.

56:40.692 --> 56:42.193
- Tuesday?
Yeah.

56:42.986 --> 56:45.113
Is there something
significant about the ninth

56:45.113 --> 56:47.365
- in other ways?
- No. Uh, it was,

56:47.365 --> 56:49.534
it was just
the first day I saw it, uh.

56:49.534 --> 56:51.244
If it... if, if...

56:51.244 --> 56:53.163
It might have been
the 11th or the 12th

56:53.163 --> 56:56.166
if, if I subbed yoga
on the,

56:56.166 --> 56:57.500
on the night of the 11th,

56:57.500 --> 56:59.210
then, uh, the yoga studio
is right there.

56:59.210 --> 57:01.421
So it would have been
a Thursday or Friday?

57:01.421 --> 57:03.214
-  Thursday or Friday.
Okay.

57:04.257 --> 57:06.176
What yoga studio?

57:06.176 --> 57:09.179
Uh, it's called
Oh Yeah Yoga.

57:09.179 --> 57:10.680
So, you said maybe

57:10.680 --> 57:13.183
you mailed it
Thursday or Friday?

57:13.183 --> 57:15.352
Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

57:15.352 --> 57:19.356
How did you know to,
uh, mail it to--

57:52.722 --> 57:54.974
So you wanted
to be able to publish it?

57:56.267 --> 57:57.227
Yeah.

57:57.852 --> 57:59.396
Did you send it
anywhere else?

57:59.396 --> 58:00.939
- No.
No?

58:01.648 --> 58:02.941
No other publications

58:02.941 --> 58:04.901
you've shown it to
or given it to?

58:04.901 --> 58:06.736
No.

58:06.736 --> 58:07.904
Is there gonna be
anything here

58:07.904 --> 58:09.406
that we're gonna be
surprised to find?

58:09.406 --> 58:11.157
No, I, I never took
the document
out of my car.

58:11.157 --> 58:13.618
Is there anything
on your phone or your computer?

58:14.786 --> 58:16.746
On my, on my phone,
you might,

58:16.746 --> 58:18.206
I don't, I don't know
if I deleted it,

58:18.206 --> 58:19.916
but you guys are probably going
to be able to see it anyway,

58:19.916 --> 58:23.628
but there will be
a screenshot of the address.

58:27.549 --> 58:29.759
- Okay.
Okay.

58:30.844 --> 58:32.762
Uh, you mentioned
you wanted some water?

58:33.805 --> 58:35.765
Yeah.

58:35.765 --> 58:37.809
- Yeah. Why don't we, uh...
- No, I'll make it.

58:38.435 --> 58:41.021
Uh, I'm just gonna
get somebody out here.

58:44.024 --> 58:46.359
Hey, can I, can I have
somebody in here, please?

58:46.359 --> 58:48.528
Uh, do you want
a bottle of water?

58:49.571 --> 58:50.822
Um...

58:52.532 --> 58:53.658
Do you have
a filter in the fridge

58:53.658 --> 58:55.160
or do you just want
tap water or...

58:55.160 --> 58:56.286
Ta-tap water.

58:56.286 --> 58:59.122
There's, um, a,
a mason jar glass

58:59.122 --> 59:00.331
next to the sink.

59:01.374 --> 59:03.293
Can I get one person
to stand here, please,

59:03.293 --> 59:05.003
so I can go to the kitchen?

59:32.405 --> 59:34.032
You guys, uh,

59:34.032 --> 59:35.742
you're not going
to fit in there anymore.

59:37.786 --> 59:39.287
She's not going to fit
in there anymore.

59:46.002 --> 59:47.420
She's still under the bed?

59:47.420 --> 59:49.422
Huh?
The cat.

59:49.422 --> 59:51.591
Is the cat
still under the bed?

59:53.259 --> 59:54.678
She's a big girl.

01:00:02.686 --> 01:00:04.354
Oh yeah,
we-we're trying.

01:00:04.354 --> 01:00:06.022
How old is she?

01:00:09.693 --> 01:00:11.653
She's three years now.

01:00:17.409 --> 01:00:18.702
But girl likes to eat.

01:00:18.702 --> 01:00:20.036
Oh yeah.

01:00:20.537 --> 01:00:21.871
She likes carbs.

01:00:21.871 --> 01:00:23.915
She's got
a little slim fit on her.

01:00:23.915 --> 01:00:25.083
Mm-hmm.

01:00:25.458 --> 01:00:27.252
She came out,
I was like...

01:00:27.252 --> 01:00:28.586
Whoa!

01:00:30.213 --> 01:00:31.548
Yeah.

01:00:31.548 --> 01:00:33.591
She'll snatch bread
right out of my mouth.

01:00:33.591 --> 01:00:34.718
- Like...
Wow.

01:00:34.718 --> 01:00:36.720
...girl,
you do not need those.

01:01:01.119 --> 01:01:02.162
Water.

01:01:08.543 --> 01:01:09.794
Thanks.

01:01:15.633 --> 01:01:17.969
So other than the screenshot
on the phone,

01:01:17.969 --> 01:01:19.137
there shouldn't be
anything else?

01:01:19.137 --> 01:01:21.473
And there should be nothing
on the laptop?

01:01:21.473 --> 01:01:22.849
Nothing on the laptop.

01:01:26.519 --> 01:01:28.146
I do have a Tor browser.

01:01:33.068 --> 01:01:37.113
Which probably looks bad, but...

01:01:38.531 --> 01:01:40.950
Okay.

01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:43.828
What do you... use,
what do you use
the Tor browser for?

01:02:12.232 --> 01:02:14.234
Have you had any contact
with anyone from--

01:02:24.411 --> 01:02:25.954
The Intercept?

01:02:27.122 --> 01:02:28.957
Have you tried to reach out?

01:02:28.957 --> 01:02:32.085
Like you said,
I saw the article,

01:02:32.085 --> 01:02:34.254

it wasn't a thing.

01:02:35.213 --> 01:02:36.381
It made you mad.

01:02:37.966 --> 01:02:39.926
It made me very mad.

01:04:47.178 --> 01:04:48.972
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:51.349
Say?

01:04:52.517 --> 01:04:53.685
Talk about why?

01:05:03.486 --> 01:05:04.904
I was just...

01:05:07.407 --> 01:05:11.202
I just thought that...
that week

01:05:12.537 --> 01:05:15.540
there was just too much
to sit back
and watch it and think,

01:05:16.332 --> 01:05:19.669
why do I have this job
if I'm going to be helpless?

01:05:21.338 --> 01:05:22.380
It was just...

01:05:24.382 --> 01:05:25.425
I'm sorry.

01:05:28.011 --> 01:05:29.512
It was just the final straw.

01:05:31.348 --> 01:05:33.433
Was there something
that just

01:05:34.809 --> 01:05:36.394
just... did it.

01:05:37.937 --> 01:05:39.856
Because you don't seem
the type to do this.

01:05:40.523 --> 01:05:42.817
- I-I-I'm not.
I-I-I believe in it.
I wanna believe in it.

01:05:42.817 --> 01:05:44.194
I'm not. I--

01:05:45.862 --> 01:05:48.698
I want to go out
With our Special Forces.

01:05:49.366 --> 01:05:51.576
I mean, that's why I got
out of the Air Force.

01:05:51.576 --> 01:05:52.535
I-I-I...

01:05:52.535 --> 01:05:54.537
It's wh--
it's why I'm here in Augusta.

01:05:54.537 --> 01:05:56.206
I-I was trying to get
my clearance back

01:05:56.206 --> 01:05:57.874
so I could get deployments.

01:05:57.874 --> 01:06:00.960
I-- It just was at a time
I wasn't applying
for deployments. I...

01:06:02.629 --> 01:06:05.090
I had seven, eight months
left of a job

01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:06.549
that didn't mean
anything to me

01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:08.968
because it's, it's Iran,
and I'm a Pashto linguist.

01:06:08.968 --> 01:06:11.346
Like, what am I doing
translating Farsi?

01:06:11.346 --> 01:06:12.639
I-I just...

01:06:14.599 --> 01:06:15.934
I felt hopeless.

01:06:15.934 --> 01:06:17.977
And seeing that information

01:06:17.977 --> 01:06:20.105
be contested back
and forth,

01:06:20.105 --> 01:06:22.065
back and forth
in the public domain

01:06:22.065 --> 01:06:24.067
with everything else
that just keeps getting released

01:06:24.067 --> 01:06:26.069
and everything that keeps
getting leaked, like,

01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:28.738
why can't this
get out there?

01:06:28.738 --> 01:06:30.448
Why can't this be public?

01:06:36.830 --> 01:06:39.124
Were you surprised
to see us today?

01:06:43.253 --> 01:06:44.963
Yeah. Actually, I thought

01:06:45.547 --> 01:06:47.007
you were here to ask
about the house

01:06:47.007 --> 01:06:49.259
because it's still
for lease online.

01:06:49.259 --> 01:06:51.845
Because you didn't seem
surprised when we pulled up.

01:06:52.345 --> 01:06:55.765
Oh, God. That's just because
I have a resting bitch face.

01:06:56.516 --> 01:07:00.520
You guys turn around
and, and "FBI."

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:03.106
I was like, what is going on,
you know?

01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:07.193
And then you showed
your badge right up and, uh...

01:07:10.321 --> 01:07:13.241
I submitted my
security packet yesterday

01:07:13.241 --> 01:07:14.617
for my clearance on E-QIP.

01:07:14.617 --> 01:07:15.702
So I thought

01:07:16.786 --> 01:07:18.288
that was what it's for.

01:07:18.288 --> 01:07:20.123
I was like,
why are you guys questioning me

01:07:20.123 --> 01:07:21.207
for my own clearance?

01:07:21.207 --> 01:07:22.834
- But...
Okay.

01:07:24.794 --> 01:07:26.504
That's, that's not going
to happen.

01:07:27.672 --> 01:07:29.049
Uh...

01:07:29.049 --> 01:07:30.550
Anything else
you can think of?

01:07:31.509 --> 01:07:33.636
What we have to do is
we have to do the search.

01:07:33.636 --> 01:07:34.888
Of course.

01:07:34.888 --> 01:07:37.515
Uh, you said--

01:07:39.309 --> 01:07:41.269
Sorry, I have
a sinus infection,

01:07:41.269 --> 01:07:42.562
- so I sound...
- It's okay?

01:07:43.563 --> 01:07:45.482
I sound awful.

01:07:45.482 --> 01:07:47.192
Well, this is the best room
to be in it with.

01:07:48.485 --> 01:07:50.445
Do you remember
the site from memory?

01:07:51.738 --> 01:07:55.241
Uh, if you scroll down
to the bottom, there's contact,

01:07:55.241 --> 01:07:57.160
but it-it's not as obvious
as you think

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.661
because it's closer.

01:07:58.661 --> 01:07:59.537
Mm-hmm.

01:07:59.537 --> 01:08:01.206
How long did it
take you to find it?

01:08:03.792 --> 01:08:06.628
<i>About probably three minutes
of scrolling,</i>

01:08:06.628 --> 01:08:09.798
which felt like an eternity
sitting in my car.

01:08:11.299 --> 01:08:12.676
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

01:08:12.676 --> 01:08:14.302
- Yeah.
Uh...

01:08:15.053 --> 01:08:17.222
you said the documents
stayed in your car.

01:08:19.307 --> 01:08:22.227
- Yeah.
Where did you
get the envelope?

01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:26.731
The box of envelopes is...

01:08:28.358 --> 01:08:31.027
it's on the back seat
in the car

01:08:31.027 --> 01:08:32.904
behind the driver's seat.
I--

01:08:33.738 --> 01:08:37.075
I had a bunch of forms
I had to mail out last December,

01:08:37.075 --> 01:08:38.910
so it's been in my car
since December.

01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:40.912
Okay.

01:08:40.912 --> 01:08:42.247
And the stamps?

01:08:42.914 --> 01:08:44.249
Stamps.

01:08:45.375 --> 01:08:48.128
I think I have about one
or two left in there,

01:08:48.128 --> 01:08:50.338
uh, but I-I keep stamps
in the glove box

01:08:50.338 --> 01:08:52.632
in case I have
to mail anything out,

01:08:52.632 --> 01:08:54.217
like bills and stuff.

01:08:54.217 --> 01:08:56.720
Okay. In, in your glove box?

01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:57.846
In the glove box, yeah.

01:08:58.596 --> 01:09:01.349
Alright.
Uh, I'm trying to think
if I have anything else.

01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:04.561
Uh, the search, the, the guys
will continue the search.

01:09:05.103 --> 01:09:07.105
Search the vehicle
and the house,

01:09:07.105 --> 01:09:09.441
and they'll photograph everything.

01:09:09.899 --> 01:09:12.360
Um, you, uh,
the search team leader,

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:14.738
uh, is gonna sit down with you
and go through things...

01:09:21.244 --> 01:09:23.079
My passport...

01:09:26.499 --> 01:09:28.877
<i>Do you have, uh,
any questions for me?</i>

01:09:30.128 --> 01:09:31.629
<i>So many, um.</i>

01:09:34.007 --> 01:09:36.384
This sounds really bad.

01:09:38.345 --> 01:09:40.180
Am I going to jail tonight?

01:09:42.849 --> 01:09:45.185
I don't know
how to answer that yet.

01:09:45.185 --> 01:09:46.686
- Okay.
What was the question?

01:09:46.686 --> 01:09:49.272
- Uh, if she's
going to jail tonight.
- Oh.

01:09:49.272 --> 01:09:51.316
Said I don't have the answer
to that quite yet.

01:09:53.485 --> 01:09:55.820
Of course, the, the search
is still going on, uh.

01:09:56.488 --> 01:09:57.822
In the case that...

01:09:59.074 --> 01:10:01.117
I don't have memorized...

01:10:01.117 --> 01:10:03.411
The woman,
her name is Cathy.

01:10:03.411 --> 01:10:05.914
She works at
the Augusta Humane Society.

01:10:05.914 --> 01:10:08.792
Okay.
- She can come and pick up
the dog in the case that

01:10:08.792 --> 01:10:09.793
I-I-I-I'm not here tonight.

01:10:09.793 --> 01:10:12.837
Well, let's don't...
Okay.

01:10:12.837 --> 01:10:14.130
It's just...

01:10:14.130 --> 01:10:15.215
Let's don't put the cart

01:10:15.215 --> 01:10:16.675
before the horse right now.

01:10:17.175 --> 01:10:18.802
Okay.

01:10:18.802 --> 01:10:20.762
Okay?

01:10:20.762 --> 01:10:22.305
- That's just, um...
I understand.

01:10:22.305 --> 01:10:23.765
...my only concern
is getting her

01:10:23.765 --> 01:10:26.309
and then maybe one more phone
call to get the cat covered.

01:10:26.309 --> 01:10:27.811
We'll, we'll figure that out.

01:10:27.811 --> 01:10:29.896
If, if it comes to that,

01:10:30.397 --> 01:10:32.148
we'll, we'll figure
that out.

01:10:32.148 --> 01:10:34.484
And I don't have
the answer to that yet.
And I'm going to...

01:10:34.484 --> 01:10:36.820
We'll, we'll cross that bridge
when we get to it. Okay?

01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:38.196
Okay.

01:10:38.196 --> 01:10:40.657
Uh, what else?

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.501
You turn it off?

01:11:33.501 --> 01:11:34.878
It's still recording.

01:11:54.064 --> 01:11:55.398
<i>Copy.</i>

01:12:05.325 --> 01:12:06.910
Would you like
to sit down somewhere?

01:12:07.452 --> 01:12:09.412
- I'm fine.
- You're fine?

01:12:09.913 --> 01:12:10.955
Yeah.

01:12:33.269 --> 01:12:34.521
Reality.

01:13:34.164 --> 01:13:36.791
Automated voice:
<i>Hello. This is a prepaid
collect call</i>

01:13:36.791 --> 01:13:38.668

<i>This call is subject

01:13:42.881 --> 01:13:45.091
<i>- To accept charges, press one.</i>

01:13:45.091 --> 01:13:46.843
<i>As soon as Mom
and Gary get to Georgia,</i>

01:13:46.843 --> 01:13:48.178
<i>they're going
to pick up Mina at least,</i>

01:13:48.178 --> 01:13:51.097
<i>and Mickey will stay back
with the shelter,</i>

01:13:51.097 --> 01:13:53.224
<i>but they're safe
in the house.</i>

01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:56.978
<i>Everyone was really
worried about them when
they searched my house.</i>

01:13:58.104 --> 01:13:59.731
<i>Bunch of dog people.</i>

01:14:00.607 --> 01:14:02.359
<i>Yeah. I mean, that was
the one thing, like,</i>

01:14:02.359 --> 01:14:04.027
<i>when the FBI
was interrogating me,</i>

01:14:04.027 --> 01:14:05.403
<i>they were just like,</i>

01:14:05.403 --> 01:14:07.238
<i>look, we have everything.
We're just...</i>

01:14:07.739 --> 01:14:09.199
<i>we just want
to know why.</i>

01:14:10.158 --> 01:14:11.493
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

01:14:12.702 --> 01:14:14.162
<i>They didn't care
about anything else.</i>

01:14:14.162 --> 01:14:16.498
<i>They were just straight-up
curious to know why.</i>

01:14:16.498 --> 01:14:18.667
They say Reality Winner
has two faces.

01:14:18.667 --> 01:14:20.460
One an Air Force veteran,

01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:22.212
a loving daughter,
and a yoga instructor.

01:14:22.212 --> 01:14:24.923
The other, a person who
had taken a keen interest

01:14:24.923 --> 01:14:27.258
in the Middle East
with suspicious motives.

01:14:27.258 --> 01:14:29.135
When asked by the FBI,

01:14:29.135 --> 01:14:32.389
Winner stated that she knew
the intelligence report

01:14:32.389 --> 01:14:36.101
revealed sources and methods

01:14:36.518 --> 01:14:39.270
used by the U.S.
intelligence agencies,

01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:42.857
and she knew that compromising
those sources and methods

01:14:42.857 --> 01:14:45.568
could be valuable
to our adversaries

01:14:45.568 --> 01:14:47.737
and damage the United States.

01:14:48.238 --> 01:14:51.157
<i>She claimed
to hate America.</i>

01:14:51.866 --> 01:14:56.413
<i>When asked, "You don't really
hate America, right?"</i>

01:14:56.413 --> 01:14:59.374
She responded,
"I mean, yeah, I do.

01:14:59.374 --> 01:15:03.712
It's literally the worst thing
to happen on the planet."

01:15:04.754 --> 01:15:07.424
She was the
quintessential example

01:15:07.424 --> 01:15:09.175
<i>of an insider threat.</i>

01:15:09.509 --> 01:15:12.012
<i>Obviously an intemperate
political activist,</i>

01:15:12.012 --> 01:15:14.264
<i>how did she get
a security clearance?</i>

01:15:14.264 --> 01:15:15.849
<i>We could ask
the same question</i>

01:15:15.849 --> 01:15:19.227
<i>about a lot of people
working in government
right now...</i>

01:15:19.227 --> 01:15:21.479
<i>I keep telling myself
to act more like I think</i>

01:15:21.479 --> 01:15:23.064
<i>I did something wrong.</i>

01:15:23.898 --> 01:15:25.734
<i>We are more concerned
with the leaks</i>

01:15:25.734 --> 01:15:28.361
<i>than we are with the fact
that the Russians</i>

01:15:28.361 --> 01:15:29.988
<i>attacked our democracy</i>

01:15:29.988 --> 01:15:31.614
<i>and that
the President's campaign</i>

01:15:31.614 --> 01:15:32.782
<i>may have participated in it.</i>

01:15:32.782 --> 01:15:34.492
<i>They didn't attack
our democracy.</i>

01:15:34.492 --> 01:15:35.910
<i>- They did.
- That's a meaningful--</i>

01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:37.412
<i>If you look at this,
this is sort of like</i>

01:15:37.412 --> 01:15:40.707
<i>The Intercept knowingly
or unknowingly</i>

01:15:40.707 --> 01:15:42.876
<i>outed their own source.</i>

01:15:42.876 --> 01:15:44.377
<i>I mean, it made no sense.</i>

01:15:44.377 --> 01:15:46.296
<i>It's like, is it that,
are you that--</i>

01:15:46.296 --> 01:15:48.798
<i>Sloppy? Irresponsible?
What is it?</i>

01:15:48.798 --> 01:15:49.674
<i>Both.</i>

01:15:49.674 --> 01:15:50.925
As a journalist,
we count on people

01:15:50.925 --> 01:15:53.345
to leak us information
that's vital

01:15:53.345 --> 01:15:54.971
for our democracy
to function.

01:15:54.971 --> 01:15:56.806
Knowing what happened
with the Russian hack

01:15:56.806 --> 01:15:58.850
<i>was a very important thing.</i>

01:15:58.850 --> 01:16:02.270
<i>Now, she did violate
the rules of her employment.</i>

01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:05.190
<i>But this penalty
that she's gotten, five years,</i>

01:16:05.190 --> 01:16:08.318
<i>is exceedingly long,
one of the longest penalties.</i>

01:16:08.318 --> 01:16:10.570
<i>And it's obviously there
to create</i>

01:16:10.570 --> 01:16:12.989
a, you know,
a chilling effect.

01:16:12.989 --> 01:16:15.325
Right? So that
other people don't do this

01:16:15.325 --> 01:16:16.951
and k-- we stay in the dark.

01:16:16.951 --> 01:16:19.329
Automated voice:
<i>You have one minute
remaining on your call.</i>

01:16:19.329 --> 01:16:20.497
<i>You have one minute left.</i>

01:16:20.497 --> 01:16:21.664
<i>If you could just get</i>

01:16:21.664 --> 01:16:22.707
<i>that message to Lane.</i>

01:16:22.707 --> 01:16:24.042
<i>Yeah, I will.</i>

01:16:24.542 --> 01:16:26.628
<i>Alright.
I really appreciate it.</i>

01:16:26.628 --> 01:16:27.712
<i>Yeah, of course.
I'm just worried that--</i>

01:16:27.712 --> 01:16:28.880
<i>Oh, and one more name.</i>

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:31.383
<i>Don Z.
Last name starts with a Z.</i>

01:16:31.383 --> 01:16:33.968
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Tell him
I'm probably not gonna</i>

01:16:34.344 --> 01:16:36.638
<i>talk to him again,
but, um,</i>

01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:39.933
<i>I'm doin' pushups like crazy
and I'm going to miss him.</i>

01:16:39.933 --> 01:16:41.518
<i>Just let him know that...</i>

01:16:41.518 --> 01:16:43.687
<i>Obviously been recording.</i>

01:16:44.521 --> 01:16:45.897
<i>I'm going to...</i>

01:16:46.981 --> 01:16:48.983
<i>What's up?</i>
<i>Going to end
the recording.</i>

01:16:48.983 --> 01:16:50.360
<i>I think so.</i>
<i>And stop the interview.</i>

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:51.528
<i>I think so.</i>

01:16:51.528 --> 01:16:54.489
<i>So this is at, uh, five,</i>

01:16:54.489 --> 01:16:57.075
<i>let's call it 5:17 p.m.,</i>

01:16:57.659 --> 01:17:00.787
<i>ceasing recording
on June third.</i>
