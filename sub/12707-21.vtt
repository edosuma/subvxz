00:01.234 --> 00:03.371
GILES:
 Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

00:03.403 --> 00:06.573
So it's her.
Under our noses all this time.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.541
-Glorificus will find
the witch.
-Witch?

00:08.576 --> 00:10.711
-Tara.
-You're not the key.
You're nothing.

00:10.743 --> 00:13.047
-No!
-(shouting)

00:13.080 --> 00:14.214
Tara!

00:14.247 --> 00:15.349
I'm so sorry.

00:15.382 --> 00:17.818
They kill mice.

00:17.850 --> 00:20.221
-Not if I get the key first.
-Could you do it?

00:20.254 --> 00:22.722
Take a human life
with your own hands?

00:24.225 --> 00:25.893
I told you this wasn't over.

00:25.925 --> 00:27.928
Such pure green energy.

00:27.960 --> 00:30.897
-The key.
-Just pack up whatever supplies
we need, and that's it.

00:30.931 --> 00:32.100
We're gone.

00:32.133 --> 00:34.101
-Giles!
-I see them.

00:36.304 --> 00:39.039
-WILLOW: Help me!
-BUFFY: How is he?

00:39.073 --> 00:41.075
-Wil?
-I think I got him
stabilized,

00:41.109 --> 00:43.743
but there's a lot of damage.
We need to get him out of here.

00:44.911 --> 00:46.012
XANDER:
We got company.

00:46.045 --> 00:47.381
The key.

00:50.417 --> 00:54.755
Once the key is activated,
the walls separating realities
will crumble.

00:54.787 --> 00:57.191
Dimensions will bleed
into each other.

00:57.225 --> 00:59.960
I won't let anything
happen to you.

00:59.993 --> 01:01.362
-Let me out.
-Wil, open the door.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.963
No! Ah!

01:04.132 --> 01:06.200
-Buffy!
-Dawn!

01:06.233 --> 01:07.801
Buffy, you have to get up.

01:07.834 --> 01:11.739
(echoing)
Buffy, please.
Buffy?

01:17.076 --> 01:19.112
MURK:
Quickly, quickly!

01:19.146 --> 01:22.382
Already we're behind schedule.
Someone's bound for a beheading.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.284
Let's make sure
it's not me.

01:24.317 --> 01:28.956
Why don't we remain,
when our moment of triumph
lies so close at hand?

01:28.989 --> 01:32.293
The Glorious One,
having acquired
much in this world,

01:32.325 --> 01:33.993
doesn't exactly
travel lightly.

01:34.027 --> 01:37.997
Hey! Minions,
I can hear you.

01:38.031 --> 01:40.301
God-like ears
don't miss much,
know what I'm sayin'?

01:40.334 --> 01:43.837
-Come here!
-'Twas he who blasphemed,
Your Magnificence.

01:43.871 --> 01:47.073
-Spurred on by
treacherous urging.
-Guys!

01:47.106 --> 01:50.109
I'm not gonna kill you.

01:50.144 --> 01:53.980
I'm not in the mood.
What do you think
that's about?

01:54.014 --> 01:56.683
In mercy does
your power lie?

01:56.716 --> 02:00.653
No, brainless.
In torture, death, and chaos
does my power lie.

02:03.156 --> 02:05.659
So tell me-- Why am I not
popping your head
like a zit right now?

02:08.195 --> 02:11.632
-Maybe I'm just hungry.
-Yes, we shall fetch
a lovely, uh--

02:11.664 --> 02:14.634
No, I'm not hungry.
(Sighs)

02:14.668 --> 02:17.305
(grunts)
I'm just a little tight
in this skin is all.

02:17.337 --> 02:21.341
I've been waiting
an eternity--
well, 25 human years--

02:21.375 --> 02:23.843
and it all comes
down to tonight.

02:23.877 --> 02:27.146
-The portal shall open.
-And the great Glorificus
shall return.

02:27.181 --> 02:29.383
To the hell I came from,

02:29.417 --> 02:33.721
where I'm gonna rain down
more super-sized portions
of slaughter, mayhem

02:33.753 --> 02:36.389
and bloodshed
than any of you scabs
can even dream about.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.728
So, how come I ain't happy?

02:43.230 --> 02:46.133
I've got everything
I ever wanted.

02:46.165 --> 02:49.569
Still, something's off.

02:51.504 --> 02:54.007
I don't know.
What do you think?

02:57.711 --> 03:00.514
(whimpering)

03:00.548 --> 03:02.250
(door opens)

03:02.282 --> 03:05.151
Better part of a century
spent in delinquency
just paid off.

03:05.185 --> 03:08.055
Hot-wired Ben's auto.
Who's for gettin'
the hell out of here?

03:08.087 --> 03:10.557
All in favor,
let's do it.
You good to go?

03:10.591 --> 03:13.561
Oh, don't worry about me.
How's Buffy?

03:13.593 --> 03:16.597
The same. Still.

03:16.629 --> 03:19.266
It's been almost
a half an hour.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.269
The Slayer's
gonna be all right,
won't she?

03:23.537 --> 03:26.205
You should
try again, Wil.

03:26.240 --> 03:30.578
All right.
But I'm not even
sure she's, you know,

03:30.610 --> 03:32.913
really in there.

03:32.945 --> 03:36.049
-Try.
-(sighs)

03:40.621 --> 03:44.292
Can you hear me?
Buffy!

03:47.461 --> 03:48.896
Buffy.

03:51.299 --> 03:53.266
WILLOW:
Buffy?

03:59.006 --> 04:00.407
(theme music playing)

04:48.721 --> 04:50.324
SPIKE:
Buffy?

04:52.393 --> 04:55.596
She can't just be
brain dead.

04:55.629 --> 05:00.166
I mean, she's still Buffy.
Somewhere in there, right?

05:00.199 --> 05:03.536
XANDER: Spike, come on.
We're not gonna get Dawn back
by sittin' around here.

05:03.571 --> 05:07.173
You're not gonna get Dawn back
any way you slice it, Harris.
That's for Buffy to decide.

05:07.206 --> 05:09.610
Good. Panic.
That ought to help.

05:09.643 --> 05:13.514
We should move her.
Un-Unless we shouldn't.

05:13.547 --> 05:16.949
-Should we?
-Couldn't that make it worse?

05:16.983 --> 05:18.985
I think I read that
somewhere.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.555
I am so large
with not knowing.

05:21.588 --> 05:24.524
It's impossible
to know for sure.

05:24.557 --> 05:27.495
Losing Dawn, after all
that Buffy's been through--

05:27.528 --> 05:30.230
I think it's pushed her too far,
into some sort of catatonia.

05:30.262 --> 05:32.365
You don't need a diploma
to see that.

05:32.399 --> 05:35.268
Snap her out of it.
Buffy!

05:36.769 --> 05:39.740
-Oi! Rise and shine, love!
-Spike.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.209
Come on, people. Girl's endowed
with Slayer strength.

05:42.242 --> 05:44.577
It's hardly the time
to get dainty. Buffy!

05:44.612 --> 05:45.913
We tried that!

05:47.047 --> 05:48.215
Ow!

05:48.247 --> 05:50.884
-We didn't try that.
-Are you insane?

05:50.918 --> 05:52.886
We could be dealing with
neurological damage here.

05:52.920 --> 05:56.423
-You want to kill her?
-We have to do something.

05:56.456 --> 05:59.692
I can't just sit here watching.
You waste time with kid gloves.

05:59.726 --> 06:02.629
I'm willing to wager,
when all's said and done,
Buffy likes it rough.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.033
Separate.

06:11.471 --> 06:15.776
Buffy's out.
Glory has Dawn.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.877
Sometime real soon,
she's gonna use Dawn...

06:17.911 --> 06:20.781
to tear down the barrier
between every dimension
there is,

06:20.814 --> 06:25.853
so if you two want to fight,
you do it after the world ends,
okay?

06:25.886 --> 06:29.689
All right. First,
we head back to Sunnydale.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.192
Xander'll take Giles
to a hospital.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.293
Anya's looking
after Tara,

06:34.326 --> 06:37.396
and, Spike, you find Glory.

06:37.430 --> 06:39.699
Check her apartment.
See if she's still there.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.603
Try anything stupid
like payback

06:42.636 --> 06:44.971
and I will get very cranky.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.141
Everyone clear?

06:51.144 --> 06:52.411
Anya?

06:52.446 --> 06:55.716
Um, w-what
will you do?

06:55.749 --> 06:59.552
-I'll help Buffy.
-Okay, then.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.790
TARA:
The world is spinning...

07:02.822 --> 07:06.826
straight to a new day.
Big day. Big, big day.
-Shh.

07:06.860 --> 07:09.562
-WILLOW:
Shh, shh, shh.
-(moans)

07:09.596 --> 07:13.266
Uh, Wil? Now, uh...

07:13.300 --> 07:16.103
don't turn me into
a horned toad for asking,

07:16.136 --> 07:19.807
but, what if we
come across Ben?

07:19.839 --> 07:22.742
I-I don't think a doctor's
what Buffy needs right now.

07:22.776 --> 07:26.079
Well, yeah. Especially not one
who also happens to be Glory.

07:26.112 --> 07:29.917
-What do you mean?
-You know. Ben is Glory.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.519
You mean...
Ben's with Glory?

07:32.552 --> 07:35.588
"With" in what sense?

07:35.622 --> 07:38.625
-They're working together?
-No. No.

07:38.658 --> 07:41.661
Ben is Glory. Glory's Ben.
They're one and the same.

07:44.731 --> 07:46.165
Well, when did
all this happen?

07:46.199 --> 07:49.569
Not one hour ago.
Right here, before
your very eyes.

07:50.838 --> 07:53.105
Ben came,
turned into Glory,

07:53.139 --> 07:55.875
snatched the kid,
and pftt! Vanished.
Remember?

07:58.011 --> 07:59.713
You do remember?

08:01.180 --> 08:02.983
Is everyone here
very stoned?

08:05.017 --> 08:09.122
Ben! Glory!
He's a doctor.
She's The Beast.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.959
Two entirely separate entities
sharing one body.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.562
It's like a bloody sitcom.
Surely you remember.

08:14.595 --> 08:17.029
So you're saying...

08:17.064 --> 08:20.466
-Ben and Glory--
-Have a connection.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.636
Yes, obviously.
But what kind?

08:22.670 --> 08:26.005
(snickers)
Oh, I get it.

08:26.038 --> 08:28.207
That's very crafty.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.343
Glory's worked
the kind of mojo

08:30.377 --> 08:33.513
where anyone who sees
her little presto-chango
instantly forgets.

08:33.547 --> 08:36.549
And yours truly,
being somewhat other
than human, stands immune.

08:38.250 --> 08:43.023
So... Ben and Glory...
a-are the same person?

08:44.356 --> 08:46.693
Glory can turn
into Ben,

08:46.726 --> 08:49.897
and Ben turns
back into Glory.

08:49.929 --> 08:53.200
And anyone who sees it
instantly forgets.

08:53.232 --> 08:55.702
(sighs)
And a Kewpie doll
for the lady.

08:56.937 --> 09:00.673
Excellent. Now...

09:00.707 --> 09:03.876
do we suspect that there may be
some kind of connection

09:03.910 --> 09:06.245
between Ben and Glory?

09:07.547 --> 09:09.282
(sighs)

09:19.993 --> 09:22.962
The key.
The key.

09:22.995 --> 09:25.432
-(loud hammering)
-MEN: (continue chanting)
The key. The key.

09:25.465 --> 09:28.368
(sawing)

09:28.400 --> 09:31.571
(chanting continues)
The key, the key.

09:43.817 --> 09:46.919
GLORY: Unbelievable how
annoying the groupies can be.
(chanting)

09:46.953 --> 09:50.256
They merely sense that tonight,
at last, the dimensional portal
shall open.

09:50.289 --> 09:53.059
GRONX: Ushering in
the long and bloody
reign of the great--

09:53.092 --> 09:56.797
-What's he doing?
-(praying)

09:56.830 --> 10:01.301
-I must anoint the key.
-You really don't. Go.

10:01.333 --> 10:02.501
-But--
-Get out!

10:02.534 --> 10:03.971
Get out! Get out!

10:07.606 --> 10:09.743
-(door slams)
-You know,

10:09.777 --> 10:14.346
you recapture your godhood
and unleash Armageddon,
and all of a sudden

10:14.380 --> 10:16.716
everybody wants to be
a part of the inner circle.

10:18.051 --> 10:22.889
-(whimpers)
-(sighs) You okay?

10:25.524 --> 10:27.527
(weakly)
I want to go home.

10:28.628 --> 10:32.032
Sweetie! Oh.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.605
-You're about to.
-(sobs)

10:38.638 --> 10:40.673
Not that fake
suburban nightmare

10:40.707 --> 10:42.775
the monks cooked up
for you, I mean
your real home.

10:42.809 --> 10:47.047
As the key,
you fit in a lock.

10:47.080 --> 10:52.351
Well, it's like a lock.
Hey. You want a pizza?

10:52.384 --> 10:55.688
-No.
-Pillow?

10:55.722 --> 10:58.057
I don't know
if this thing gets
cable. Doubtful.

10:58.091 --> 11:02.195
(sobbing)
Please. Stop.

11:02.229 --> 11:05.698
-You nervous?
-Yes.

11:08.034 --> 11:12.538
I know how you feel.
It is your last night.

11:13.941 --> 11:16.543
As, you know,
a human.

11:16.576 --> 11:20.913
This body? Ugh. It's just
a rental, Dawnie.

11:20.947 --> 11:24.583
Being human-- It's like
a costume for girls
like you and me.

11:25.786 --> 11:28.855
Being something else--
that's what we are.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.256
(softly) Don't.

11:31.924 --> 11:33.192
What?

11:33.225 --> 11:35.863
Don't call me "Dawnie."

11:35.895 --> 11:38.097
(chuckles)

11:40.366 --> 11:44.004
(chuckling)
Wow.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.206
You know,
that actually hurt
my feelings.

11:46.239 --> 11:50.309
-I'm sorry.
-Not the point.

11:53.379 --> 11:56.182
I'm just thinking.
Here I am, trying
to make you feel better,

11:56.216 --> 11:59.686
when comforting others--
not part of my life.

11:59.719 --> 12:03.190
And I'm doing it
so I can stop

12:03.222 --> 12:05.958
feeling so, um--

12:06.994 --> 12:10.462
(snapping fingers)
Help me out.
Guilty?

12:11.999 --> 12:15.302
Guilty. (chuckles)
That's it.

12:18.938 --> 12:21.740
But I'm not supposed
to feel guilty.

12:21.774 --> 12:23.743
I'm not supposed
to feel anything.

12:23.777 --> 12:28.447
I'm-I'm-- I'm a God.
I'm above it.

12:28.480 --> 12:32.251
I'm-- You.

12:34.453 --> 12:36.556
You did this to me,
didn't you?

12:36.588 --> 12:39.225
Some sort of spell.
You've been hanging
with the Wicca.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.559
You could have--

12:40.592 --> 12:41.928
But no.

12:42.929 --> 12:46.099
Not magic.
It's something else.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.434
Still, it is you
doing this.

12:49.701 --> 12:51.738
I-I'm not doing anything.

12:51.770 --> 12:54.474
-I swear.
-We'll see.

12:55.842 --> 12:58.245
Anoint this thing now!

12:58.278 --> 13:01.648
You know what
they're all chanting for
out there, Dawnie?

13:01.681 --> 13:06.586
Blood. 'Cause we found
out your blood is
the key to the key.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.589
All I gotta do
is bleed you dry,

13:09.621 --> 13:13.092
-the portal opens up,
and I can go home.
-(praying)

13:13.125 --> 13:17.463
So knock yourself out,
girlfriend. Make me feel
bad as you can.

13:20.900 --> 13:24.636
'Cause tomorrow
you bleed, little girl.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.607
ANYA: You sure you know
what you're doing?

13:28.640 --> 13:30.342
I think so.

13:31.543 --> 13:34.147
I don't know.

13:34.181 --> 13:37.716
It's not exactly
well-explored territory,
but...

13:37.750 --> 13:40.452
I gotta try.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.623
A spell like this
could be really
dangerous for Buffy.

13:43.655 --> 13:45.825
And you.
TARA:
Time--

13:45.859 --> 13:48.161
Oh, time is coming.

13:48.195 --> 13:53.033
Shh. It's okay.
I'm here.
(whimpering)

13:54.834 --> 13:57.703
-You'll look after her
while I'm--
-Sure.

13:57.736 --> 13:59.206
What do I do?

14:00.673 --> 14:04.177
Mostly just
be here for her.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.980
And there's some pills
in my knapsack.

14:08.014 --> 14:11.250
Half of one every
two hours keeps her
pretty mellow.

14:11.283 --> 14:13.352
Y-You think
you'll be gone
more than two hours?

14:14.721 --> 14:17.557
-Wish me luck?
-(sighing) Okay.

14:19.525 --> 14:23.529
-(feigning enthusiasm)
Good luck!
-Thanks.

14:26.298 --> 14:29.068
Okay. Be good now,
sweetie.

14:29.101 --> 14:32.639
I'll be back
as soon as I can.
Okay?

14:33.873 --> 14:35.475
We're good?

14:39.778 --> 14:42.749
(whimpers)

14:46.818 --> 14:48.455
(softly)
Good luck.

15:54.354 --> 15:57.624
Hi, Willow.

15:59.658 --> 16:01.128
Hello, Buffy.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.781
YOUNG BUFFY:
What are you doing here?

17:31.483 --> 17:35.387
Actually, I'm, uh,
looking for you.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.923
Do you like dolls?

17:37.957 --> 17:41.027
Buffy, what
are you doing here?

17:41.059 --> 17:43.195
I like it here.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.964
But...

17:45.998 --> 17:48.234
you know we need you.

17:48.268 --> 17:51.403
-You have to come out.
-Why?

17:51.438 --> 17:53.605
To be with your friends.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.942
It's a big day
for me.

17:55.974 --> 17:57.609
-(door opens)
-WOMAN: Hello?

17:57.644 --> 17:59.746
Mommy! Daddy!

17:59.778 --> 18:01.913
You're back!
You're back!

18:01.948 --> 18:04.916
-Hello, Buffy.
-How's my girl?

18:06.085 --> 18:08.988
Are you ready to meet
your new baby sister?

18:09.020 --> 18:12.892
Oh, come on, now, Buffy.
She's nothing to be afraid of.

18:12.924 --> 18:15.795
-Who's afraid?
-Don't you want to be
the big sister?

18:15.827 --> 18:18.298
No. I want to be
the baby.

18:18.330 --> 18:21.768
-DAD: Buffy.
-You're gonna pay
more attention to her

18:21.800 --> 18:23.836
and forget
all about me.

18:23.869 --> 18:26.439
Oh.

18:26.472 --> 18:30.176
-(gurgling)
-Doesn't she look funny?

18:30.210 --> 18:32.711
Like a wrinkly old grandpa.

18:34.213 --> 18:36.015
Like this.

18:36.048 --> 18:39.451
Okay, support the head.
There you go.

18:39.486 --> 18:41.621
We're calling her
Dawn.

18:41.653 --> 18:43.055
Dawn.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.625
I-I could be the one

18:46.659 --> 18:50.563
to look after her sometimes
if you need a helper.

18:50.663 --> 18:54.032
Mom? Can I
take care of her?

18:54.066 --> 18:57.836
(chuckles)
Yes, Buffy, you
can take care of her.

18:57.869 --> 18:59.806
(footsteps)

19:12.519 --> 19:14.421
Okay.

19:20.426 --> 19:23.128
Can you, uh--

19:23.162 --> 19:25.298
There.

19:25.332 --> 19:29.301
How you doin'?
It only hurts when
I answer pointless questions.

19:29.336 --> 19:33.005
Where's Buffy?
Willow's on it.
Or in it.

19:33.038 --> 19:35.842
She's workin' some spell,
trying to reach Buffy
psychically.

19:35.875 --> 19:39.246
She's gone
into Buffy's mind?
Pretty trippy stuff.

19:39.278 --> 19:43.883
It's extraordinarily advanced.
I was thinking we should check
on Glory's victims...

19:43.915 --> 19:47.487
while we're here.
The mental ward?
I already been.

19:47.519 --> 19:49.521
The vegetable
section's closed.
Nobody there.

19:49.556 --> 19:52.491
It's like they all just
got up and walked away.
(gasping)

19:52.525 --> 19:56.328
Checked out Glory's flat.
Looks like the great one
has scampered.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.897
Gone to, uh,
perform her ritual
with Dawn

19:58.931 --> 20:01.233
and leaving us
entirely clueless.

20:01.268 --> 20:04.036
Not entirely.

20:04.069 --> 20:07.006
I know this bloke.

20:07.038 --> 20:09.875
Well, not
so much a bloke
so much as a demon.

20:09.909 --> 20:15.281
But still bookish. All tuned in
to the nastier corners of
this, our magic world.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.250
It's a bit of
a last resort, really,

20:17.284 --> 20:20.086
but still,
we might persuade him...

20:20.118 --> 20:22.221
to suss out
Glory's game plan.

20:25.424 --> 20:27.826
-Sound worthy?
-(sighs)

20:29.296 --> 20:32.632
Off we go, then.
Meet back at the shop.

20:32.664 --> 20:37.068
(coughing)
Found Ben's room at Glory's.
Didn't learn much.

20:37.103 --> 20:41.540
Wait, wait,
wait, wait.
Ben? At Glory's?

20:41.574 --> 20:43.710
You're saying all
this time he's been
subletting from her?

20:43.742 --> 20:46.045
This is
gonna be worth it.

20:46.077 --> 20:48.280
-Ow!
-Ow!

20:48.315 --> 20:51.983
(chuckling)
Last time.
From the top.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.221
(sighs)
I'm hating this, Murk.

20:56.255 --> 20:59.558
And "this" would be what
exactly, Your Holiness?

20:59.592 --> 21:03.663
Memories.
I'm starting to remember
the things Ben did,

21:03.695 --> 21:06.231
people he spoke with,
stuff he wore.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.134
Mmm. Kid.

21:10.036 --> 21:13.640
I came--
He came to see you,
didn't he?

21:13.673 --> 21:17.009
-Ben?
-Yeah, Ben!

21:18.810 --> 21:22.914
You called him to the desert
when you were hiding from me.

21:22.949 --> 21:26.919
And he came.
And then he was me.
You remember?

21:26.952 --> 21:28.820
Yes.

21:28.855 --> 21:31.857
(gasps)
See? She's not supposed
to remember that.

21:31.891 --> 21:35.761
Nobody should!
The cloak between Ben
and me is fading.

21:35.795 --> 21:39.566
I almost helped her!
He-- I wanted to.

21:40.666 --> 21:42.634
Huh! I can't do this!

21:45.037 --> 21:48.875
-Get him out of me.
-Wh-What?

21:48.907 --> 21:53.311
Ben.
The human meatsack
who's infecting me.

21:53.346 --> 21:55.347
Do your mojo.
Make an incision...

21:55.382 --> 21:57.282
or removal or whatever
you gotta do.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.219
(sniffling)
Help me.

22:00.251 --> 22:03.055
I'm-I'm thinking
Ben's thoughts,

22:03.088 --> 22:06.025
and I'm feeling
his feelings

22:06.057 --> 22:08.795
and--
(groans) I--

22:08.827 --> 22:10.663
Can't kill the girl.

22:12.263 --> 22:13.833
Damn it.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.069
Help me.

22:18.104 --> 22:21.007
Th-This I cannot do.

22:21.039 --> 22:23.809
You risk
terrible magics

22:23.843 --> 22:26.011
in opening the portal.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.980
Nothing comes
without a price.

22:28.013 --> 22:30.182
This is yours.

22:30.215 --> 22:34.220
(breathing heavily)
Gods don't pay.

22:36.288 --> 22:40.593
-(gasps)
-We do this now.

22:44.130 --> 22:46.665
Hey! I know you.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.567
You-You're
the first original Slayer

22:48.601 --> 22:50.802
who tried killing us all
in our dreams.

22:53.105 --> 22:54.507
How've you been?

22:54.540 --> 22:56.075
Death is your gift.

22:57.242 --> 23:00.680
-Death is my gift?
-Wait. Death is her what?

23:00.712 --> 23:02.449
Death is your gift.

23:17.763 --> 23:19.230
Where are you going?

23:21.166 --> 23:22.401
-MURK: Glorificus! Wait!

23:22.434 --> 23:24.770
Kill the key now,
and all will be lost.

23:24.804 --> 23:27.539
We'll be stuck on
this mortal plane
forever.

23:27.574 --> 23:30.409
(choking)
All right.
You're right.

23:30.442 --> 23:35.381
It's cool.
I'm just a little
emotional right now.

23:35.413 --> 23:37.884
(chuckles)
Which, if you're
into irony-- funny.

23:37.916 --> 23:42.588
Leave. We need
a little girl time.
Good-bye.

23:47.826 --> 23:49.996
How do they do it?

23:50.028 --> 23:52.330
-(door closes)
-Do what?

23:52.364 --> 23:55.300
People.
How do they function
here like this

23:55.334 --> 23:57.836
in the world
with all this bile
running through them?

23:57.869 --> 24:01.440
Every day, it's whoo!
You have no control.
They're not even animals.

24:01.473 --> 24:03.409
They're just these
meatbaggy slaves

24:03.442 --> 24:05.411
to hormones
and pheromones

24:05.443 --> 24:07.346
and their--
and their feelings.

24:07.378 --> 24:10.249
Hate 'em.
I mean, really.

24:10.281 --> 24:12.951
Is this what
the poets go on
about? This?

24:14.854 --> 24:16.788
Call me crazy,
but as hard-core
drugs go,

24:16.823 --> 24:19.025
human emotion
is just useless.

24:19.057 --> 24:21.661
People are puppets,
everyone getting
jerked around

24:21.693 --> 24:23.128
by what
they're feelin'.

24:23.162 --> 24:27.199
Am I wrong?
Really. I want to know.

24:29.902 --> 24:31.971
Gonna bleed you either way.

24:34.173 --> 24:36.208
Depends on the person.

24:36.241 --> 24:39.878
So you're saying
some people like this.
Some.

24:39.912 --> 24:42.381
Funny, 'cause
I look around
at this world

24:42.413 --> 24:45.317
you're so eager
to be a part of,
and all I see

24:45.351 --> 24:48.386
is six billion
lunatics looking for
the fastest ride out.

24:49.756 --> 24:52.724
Who's not crazy?
Look around.

24:52.759 --> 24:56.828
Everyone's drinking,
smoking, shooting up...

24:56.863 --> 25:00.066
shooting each other,
or just plane screwing
their brains out

25:00.098 --> 25:01.867
'cause they don't
want 'em anymore.

25:03.702 --> 25:05.738
I'm crazy?

25:05.837 --> 25:08.540
Honey, I'm the original
one-eyed chicklet

25:08.575 --> 25:10.643
in the kingdom
of the blind--

25:10.676 --> 25:13.846
(sighs)
'Cause at least I admit
the world makes me nuts.

25:13.880 --> 25:16.682
Name one person
who can take it here.

25:16.715 --> 25:18.684
That's
all I'm asking.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.920
Name one.

25:20.952 --> 25:23.055
Buffy.

25:28.728 --> 25:33.031
I can't keep following
you around like this,
Buffy. We have to go.

25:34.299 --> 25:37.604
You have
to talk to... me.

25:46.578 --> 25:49.882
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

25:51.217 --> 25:54.185
Death is my gift.

25:54.220 --> 25:58.423
Yeah, I keep hearing that,
but I'm not exactly sure
what it means.

25:58.457 --> 26:01.527
It's really
not that complicated.

26:01.559 --> 26:03.394
Not for you, maybe.

26:06.932 --> 26:09.535
It's what I do.

26:09.567 --> 26:12.270
I mean, come on.
You've known me...
for how long?

26:12.304 --> 26:16.075
It's what I'm here for.
It's all I am.

26:17.175 --> 26:21.713
-(softly weeping)
-Buffy, stop!

26:21.748 --> 26:23.449
-(struggling breaths)
-No!

26:25.116 --> 26:26.653
God, no!

26:26.685 --> 26:28.988
What?

26:29.020 --> 26:32.625
I keep
telling you, Wil.
I-I figured it out.

26:32.659 --> 26:34.794
Death is my gift.

26:43.970 --> 26:46.337
Oh, Ben. This is
really not a good time.

26:46.372 --> 26:48.240
(breathing hard)

26:48.273 --> 26:50.442
Dawn,
has Glory hurt you?

26:50.476 --> 26:54.681
Uh, no. Not yet.

26:54.713 --> 26:57.449
But I have to
get out of here.

26:59.818 --> 27:02.320
Ben?

27:02.354 --> 27:05.290
You okay?

27:06.692 --> 27:08.126
Where is it?

27:10.362 --> 27:12.163
Wh-Where's what?

27:12.198 --> 27:14.866
All the blood.

27:14.901 --> 27:19.838
I can feel it,
still warm and wet.

27:19.872 --> 27:23.342
And Glory.
Oh, God.

27:23.375 --> 27:27.145
She slaughtered
hundreds of men.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.280
But I can feel them
breaking.

27:29.315 --> 27:33.652
Ben. Something is happening
to both you and Glory.

27:33.685 --> 27:37.455
(breathing hard)
I'm remembering her,
aren't I?

27:37.489 --> 27:39.991
The things she's done.
Things she's going to do.

27:40.026 --> 27:43.028
I know. Sh-She told me.

27:43.061 --> 27:46.065
I think, whatever the magic is
that keeps you guys apart

27:46.097 --> 27:48.534
is starting to break down.

27:48.567 --> 27:50.970
Ben, Glory could
come back any minute.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.204
How could she do this?

27:53.239 --> 27:56.041
I don't know.
But we have to
get out of here

27:56.075 --> 27:59.846
and find Buffy.
No!
I mean, I have a job.

27:59.878 --> 28:02.013
I have a life.
And Glory?

28:02.048 --> 28:04.150
She never once
thinks about me
in all this.

28:04.182 --> 28:06.551
(knocking on door)

28:08.287 --> 28:10.923
-Help me.
-How?

28:10.957 --> 28:12.391
HIGH PRIEST:
Highness?

28:13.925 --> 28:15.426
Please.

28:15.461 --> 28:16.895
HIGH PRIEST:
Is everything all right?

28:18.865 --> 28:19.932
You're not--

28:26.605 --> 28:29.842
I'll take you as far as I can.
Ditch you before she comes back.

28:29.875 --> 28:32.778
WILLOW:
Okay. Now, this is weird.

28:34.079 --> 28:36.281
Hi, Willow. What
are you doing here?

28:36.315 --> 28:39.786
Actually, I'm, uh,
looking for you here.

28:39.818 --> 28:41.720
Again.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.058
Do you like dolls?

28:47.093 --> 28:51.730
No, and I think
we already "deja'd" this vu.

28:51.763 --> 28:54.532
(giggles)
You talk funny.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.969
Yes. As you'll
tell me again

28:57.002 --> 28:59.637
when we're older
and in chem class.

28:59.671 --> 29:02.641
Buffy, what
are we doing here?

29:02.673 --> 29:04.576
Don't you like it here?

29:04.609 --> 29:07.413
We don't have time.

29:07.445 --> 29:09.816
-(door opening)
-Mommy! Daddy!

29:09.848 --> 29:12.984
DAD: We're home!
YOUNG BUFFY:
You're back! You're back!

29:13.019 --> 29:15.520
Hi, Buffy.

29:17.789 --> 29:20.092
We're calling her Dawn.

29:25.832 --> 29:27.298
(baby cries softly)

29:27.333 --> 29:30.269
I could be the one
to look after her
sometimes.

29:38.210 --> 29:41.047
-(knocking on door)
-It's always open!

29:42.147 --> 29:43.648
What can I do
for you boys?

29:43.682 --> 29:45.284
Want some cocoa?

29:46.952 --> 29:48.287
SPIKE:
No.

29:48.319 --> 29:50.455
We need information.
We need--

29:50.489 --> 29:52.157
Ben's Glory!

29:52.191 --> 29:53.791
Who's what?

29:53.826 --> 29:55.794
Look at this--
Special Ed remembers.

29:55.827 --> 29:59.365
Yeah, I do.
Ben's Glory,
and Glory's Ben.

29:59.397 --> 30:01.633
It's like this
fog's liftin'.

30:01.666 --> 30:03.602
Wonderful.
But not why we're here.

30:03.634 --> 30:06.204
Hell-god type,
name of Glory--

30:06.238 --> 30:09.275
-XANDER: A.K.A. Ben--
-Has gone missing.

30:09.307 --> 30:11.343
She's brewing up
some major league bad.

30:11.376 --> 30:14.012
And she's nicked
the Slayer's kid sister
in the bargain.

30:14.046 --> 30:18.817
Hmm. That girl
you brought here.
Sweet little thing.

30:18.851 --> 30:23.689
How'd things work out
with her mom? Changed
her mind, didn't she?

30:23.721 --> 30:27.259
Yeah.
You got any idea where
Glory would take her?

30:28.594 --> 30:33.398
Glory. Glory. Ooh!

30:33.432 --> 30:35.867
Y-You don't mean Glorificus?

30:35.902 --> 30:38.670
Gosh. What do you
want to get mixed up
with her for?

30:38.703 --> 30:40.638
That's a sure way
to get yourselves
killed.

30:40.672 --> 30:43.075
I hear she's
awfully unpleasant.

30:43.108 --> 30:45.844
When it comes
to hell-gods,
my best advice...

30:45.877 --> 30:49.214
is get out of the way
and stay there.

30:49.248 --> 30:51.217
Love to. Can't.

30:51.250 --> 30:56.587
Well, uh,
other than that,
I'd like to help.

30:58.289 --> 31:00.526
But I-I'm
a small town guy.

31:00.558 --> 31:03.362
This Glorificus--
if it is her--

31:03.394 --> 31:05.696
Whew. She's big city.

31:05.730 --> 31:07.499
She's got Dawn.

31:07.532 --> 31:08.934
Right.

31:10.936 --> 31:13.105
Well, I may know
a fella,

31:13.138 --> 31:15.540
you know,
who knows a fella
in-in China.

31:15.574 --> 31:18.176
He might--
How the hell are we
supposed to get to China?

31:18.210 --> 31:20.211
-Teleport?
-I guess.

31:20.246 --> 31:24.282
You know, if you're
in that much of a hurry,
I wish you luck.

31:24.316 --> 31:26.085
You're lying.

31:27.385 --> 31:30.056
And what's more,
I believe you're standing...

31:30.088 --> 31:32.157
right in front of
the very thing we need.

31:37.895 --> 31:41.267
-(whispering) Idiot.
-(grunts) Get him!

31:42.433 --> 31:43.801
(grunting)

31:48.807 --> 31:52.478
You think only
underworld bottom-feeders
worship The Beast?

32:00.618 --> 32:03.654
Her day is coming,
boys!

32:03.689 --> 32:06.992
And when she returns,
then you're gonna see
something.

32:12.530 --> 32:14.400
-(groans)
-Ow!

32:14.432 --> 32:17.336
(grunting)

32:28.146 --> 32:31.717
What do we got?
Something worth
dying for.

32:33.951 --> 32:36.188
(sizzling)

32:43.828 --> 32:46.698
WILLOW: Buffy, will you
just stop a second
and listen to me?

32:46.731 --> 32:48.866
Buffy.

32:48.900 --> 32:51.869
You have to
stop doing this.
Doing what?

32:51.903 --> 32:54.272
-Killing Dawn.
-Why?

32:54.306 --> 32:56.275
Because this
never happened.

32:56.307 --> 32:58.443
You never killed
your sister.

32:58.477 --> 33:02.681
-Wil, I did this.
-In your imagination.

33:02.713 --> 33:04.482
None of this is real.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.817
Y-You're stuck
in some kind of loop.

33:06.852 --> 33:10.521
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Excuse me.

33:10.556 --> 33:13.791
Buffy, why are
you doing this?

33:13.825 --> 33:16.028
(panting, gasping)

33:16.061 --> 33:20.066
I think they see us.
Stay close to me.
Don't look back.

33:20.098 --> 33:21.900
(breathing nervously)

33:23.868 --> 33:25.936
Shh!
Stay very still.
(men chattering)

33:32.411 --> 33:34.011
(grunts)

33:35.780 --> 33:37.182
I'm sorry.

33:38.717 --> 33:40.086
Sorry?

33:41.386 --> 33:45.290
That actually hurt,
you prepubescent puke.

33:53.030 --> 33:55.901
Okay. First thought--
just totally
spontaneous, unfiltered,

33:55.933 --> 33:58.036
off the top
of my head: Ow!

33:58.069 --> 34:00.038
(clattering)

34:00.071 --> 34:04.175
You hit Ben
in his soft human head,
and I remember the pain.

34:04.210 --> 34:07.078
(gasps, cries out)

34:07.113 --> 34:10.047
You probably think I won't
waste any precious blood
of yours till tonight.

34:10.081 --> 34:12.251
You're right. But I know

34:12.284 --> 34:14.385
-a thousand ways to hurt you...
-(screams)

34:14.420 --> 34:17.922
that won't spill a drop--
and you know those pesky
feelings I've been having?

34:17.956 --> 34:19.391
Like guilt, empathy?

34:19.425 --> 34:22.893
I decided I'm gonna take 'em
and mash 'em back down
where they belong. Okay?

34:22.927 --> 34:26.097
Now, let's have
big girl fun--

34:26.132 --> 34:27.931
-(gasps)
-Just you and--

34:27.965 --> 34:29.900
-Ow!
-Leave her alone.

34:32.503 --> 34:35.072
I said,
leave her alone.

34:35.106 --> 34:39.244
No, no. Little late in
the game to start growing
a backbone, Benjamin.

34:39.277 --> 34:42.079
Now, be good,
and stay quiet.
No, you don't!

34:42.114 --> 34:44.449
Get over yourself, Ben!

34:44.483 --> 34:47.318
This is the way things are.
I'm strong. You're weak.

34:47.353 --> 34:51.056
(chuckles)
This is reality. Stop trying
to infect me with your--

34:51.088 --> 34:53.724
Do you ever stop talking?

34:53.759 --> 34:56.795
I don't know which is worse.
waking up in a dress,
not knowing where I've been,

34:56.827 --> 35:00.465
or having to hear all
your self-involved ranting!

35:00.498 --> 35:03.101
-Animal.
-Wrong, Glory.
I'm no animal.

35:03.135 --> 35:05.137
This is humanity
you're feeling.

35:05.170 --> 35:08.005
-Welcome to the world.
-No, no, no!

35:11.610 --> 35:13.911
Stick around, chica.

35:13.945 --> 35:16.481
I won't let you
hurt her, Glory.

35:16.514 --> 35:19.818
Ooh! Shut your hole,
you sanctimonious
little meatworm.

35:19.851 --> 35:23.054
I'm going home
no matter what you do.

35:26.791 --> 35:28.659
You really think I'll
just let that happen?

35:28.693 --> 35:31.197
Benjamin, what
are you doing?

35:31.230 --> 35:33.498
You need her blood?

35:33.532 --> 35:36.534
When I'm through, there
won't be enough left
to fill a bottle cap.

35:36.568 --> 35:39.237
-Then you, hellbitch,
have nowhere left--
-To go. (gasps)

35:42.340 --> 35:43.875
(bottle shatters)

35:45.510 --> 35:47.679
You can't hurt her,
and you know it, Ben.

35:49.347 --> 35:51.817
I know it because I feel
what you're feeling.

35:51.849 --> 35:54.719
Scared.
Shh! Shh! It's okay.

35:54.753 --> 35:57.789
You don't want to die.
Who would?

35:57.822 --> 36:00.858
-(chuckles) I don't.
-You can't. You're immortal.

36:02.059 --> 36:04.795
GLORY: Nobody has to die
here, Ben.

36:04.829 --> 36:08.666
Just let me bleed the girl
and go home. Everything'll
work out fine.

36:08.699 --> 36:12.237
Do you really believe,
with all I know,
that you can trick me?

36:12.271 --> 36:14.539
Stop and think,
baby.

36:14.572 --> 36:17.708
We bleed the kid,
return me to my seat
of power.

36:17.742 --> 36:19.878
I become a God again.

36:19.911 --> 36:24.750
-And I disappear.
-Ooh, unless somebody
up there likes you.

36:24.782 --> 36:28.820
Give up the girl,
I could like you a lot.

36:28.853 --> 36:31.590
BEN:
I won't make a deal
with you, Glory.

36:31.623 --> 36:34.025
When exactly
did you get stupid?

36:34.059 --> 36:37.128
I'm offering
immortality here.

36:39.797 --> 36:42.601
I believe you.
That's not the problem.

36:42.634 --> 36:44.735
You make me immortal.
Then what?

36:44.769 --> 36:47.606
I have to kill her
to do it, and I won't be
able to live with that.

36:47.639 --> 36:49.907
Not even for a day.
Forget about eternity.

36:49.940 --> 36:52.911
Hey, baby,
Baby, baby Ben.

36:52.943 --> 36:55.614
Why do you
worry so much?

36:55.646 --> 36:59.918
When you're immortal,
all this crap you've been
carrying around inside--

36:59.951 --> 37:03.922
The guilt, the anger,
the crazy-making pain--

37:03.954 --> 37:07.726
Ooh, it all just
melts away like ice cream.

37:07.759 --> 37:11.061
Trust me.
When all this is over,

37:11.096 --> 37:13.632
I can set you up real nice.

37:13.664 --> 37:15.800
I'm makin' it easy.

37:15.833 --> 37:18.269
It's you or the girl.

37:19.637 --> 37:22.641
I can't accept that.
(breathing heavily)

37:22.673 --> 37:25.476
Accept it.
(chuckles)

37:25.510 --> 37:28.079
I'm a God, stupid.

37:36.487 --> 37:39.958
I'm sorry.

37:39.990 --> 37:42.126
(gasps)

37:43.961 --> 37:46.297
Don't make this harder
than it already is.

37:46.331 --> 37:49.800
I'm sorry.
I got no choice.
It's you or me.

37:58.043 --> 38:01.780
No. Buffy!
Leave Dawn alone.
What is this?

38:01.813 --> 38:04.181
My gift.
This is what I do.

38:04.215 --> 38:07.018
I'm not talking about this.
I'm talking about...

38:08.119 --> 38:10.054
this.

38:18.630 --> 38:21.266
Right here, it happened.
I know

38:21.298 --> 38:24.635
it's something small,
but it's something.

38:24.670 --> 38:27.873
-What?
-Don't go there, Wil.

38:27.905 --> 38:31.677
I'm not.
You're the one who keeps
dragging me back here.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.811
A-And you wouldn't
be doing that...

38:33.844 --> 38:37.047
if you weren't trying
to show me something.

38:37.081 --> 38:39.684
Do I?

38:39.717 --> 38:42.853
Buffy, come on.
It-it's your brain.
Just tell me.

38:46.724 --> 38:48.193
WILLOW:
What happened here?

38:50.829 --> 38:52.364
This was when I quit, Wil.

38:52.398 --> 38:55.132
You did?

38:55.166 --> 38:56.902
Just for a second.

38:58.268 --> 39:00.204
-BUFFY:
I remember.

39:00.237 --> 39:02.807
I was in the magic shop.

39:02.840 --> 39:05.175
I put a book back
for Giles.

39:06.612 --> 39:10.581
Nothing special about it.
And then it hit me.

39:11.750 --> 39:13.184
What hit you?

39:15.052 --> 39:17.021
I can't beat Glory.

39:17.054 --> 39:19.056
Glory's going to win.

39:19.090 --> 39:21.192
You can't know that.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.094
I didn't
just know it.

39:24.128 --> 39:28.233
I felt it.
Glory will beat me.

39:28.266 --> 39:30.768
And in that second
of knowing it, Wil?

39:30.802 --> 39:32.871
I wanted it to happen.

39:32.903 --> 39:35.974
-Why?
-I wanted it over.

39:37.775 --> 39:40.411
This is-- All of this--

39:41.947 --> 39:43.914
It's too much for me.

39:43.949 --> 39:46.217
I just wanted it over.

39:46.251 --> 39:50.121
If Glory wins,
then Dawn dies.

39:50.155 --> 39:54.659
And I would grieve.
People would feel
sorry for me.

39:55.994 --> 39:57.929
But it would be over.

39:59.597 --> 40:01.833
I imagined
what a relief
it would be.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.740
I killed Dawn.

40:13.612 --> 40:15.646
Is that what you think?

40:15.681 --> 40:17.849
BUFFY:
My thinking it
made it happen.

40:19.349 --> 40:21.487
Some part of me
wanted it.

40:23.454 --> 40:26.492
And in the moment,
Glory took Dawn.

40:26.525 --> 40:28.460
I know I could've
done something better.

40:30.295 --> 40:31.862
But I didn't.

40:33.130 --> 40:35.800
I was off by some
fraction of a second.

40:35.833 --> 40:37.802
And this is why--

40:37.835 --> 40:40.338
I killed my sister.

40:40.371 --> 40:43.742
WILLOW: I think Spike was right
back at the gas station.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.309
Snap out of it!

40:45.342 --> 40:47.244
-What?
-What?

40:47.277 --> 40:50.581
All this--
it has a name.

40:50.615 --> 40:54.085
It's called guilt.
It's a feeling,
and it's important.

40:54.119 --> 40:56.755
But it's not more
than that, Buffy.

40:56.788 --> 41:00.791
Buffies. You've carried
the weight of the world
on your shoulders

41:00.826 --> 41:04.329
since high school--
and I-I know you didn't
ask for this,

41:04.362 --> 41:07.331
but you do it,
every day.

41:07.364 --> 41:11.135
And so, you wanted out
for one second.

41:11.168 --> 41:12.538
So what?

41:12.570 --> 41:15.206
I got Dawn killed.

41:15.239 --> 41:18.510
Hello! Your sister?
Not dead yet.

41:18.543 --> 41:21.146
But she will be
if you stay
locked inside here

41:21.179 --> 41:22.413
and never come back to us.

41:23.681 --> 41:24.916
And what if I can't?

41:26.552 --> 41:31.088
Then I guess you're right,
and you did kill your sister.

41:33.891 --> 41:37.094
Wait.
Where are you going?

41:40.532 --> 41:44.402
Where you're needed.
Are you coming?

41:55.780 --> 41:57.347
(breathing fitfully)

42:14.800 --> 42:16.735
-(door opens, bell rings)
-Buffy?

42:16.768 --> 42:19.036
She's back.
XANDER:
You're okay?

42:19.070 --> 42:23.108
Yeah. I'm okay.
I hear you found
the ritual text.

42:23.141 --> 42:25.110
Uh, something
like that, yes.

42:25.143 --> 42:27.244
Did you know that
Ben is Glory?

42:27.277 --> 42:29.780
So I'm told.
What do we know?

42:29.815 --> 42:32.884
Um, well, uh,
according
to these scrolls,

42:32.918 --> 42:35.320
uh, it is possible
for Glory
to be stopped.

42:37.088 --> 42:39.523
I-I'm afraid
it's, um--

42:39.556 --> 42:41.626
Buffy, I've read
these things
very carefully,

42:41.659 --> 42:44.362
and there's not much
margin for error.

42:44.394 --> 42:46.364
You understand
what I'm saying?

42:46.396 --> 42:49.067
Might help if you
actually said it.

42:51.769 --> 42:54.905
Um-- (grunts)

42:54.940 --> 43:00.244
Glory plans to open
a dimensional portal

43:00.277 --> 43:02.748
by way of
a ritual bloodletting.

43:04.349 --> 43:06.617
-Dawn's blood.
-Yes.

43:08.119 --> 43:11.588
Once the blood is shed
at a certain time and place,

43:11.623 --> 43:15.525
the fabric which
separates all realities
will be ripped apart.

43:17.295 --> 43:19.831
Dimensions will pour
into one another...

43:19.864 --> 43:22.132
with no barriers
to stop them.

43:23.333 --> 43:25.335
Reality as we know it
will be destroyed,

43:25.369 --> 43:29.007
and chaos
will reign on earth.

43:29.039 --> 43:31.009
So how do we stop it?

43:31.041 --> 43:35.346
The portal will only close
once the blood is stopped.

43:35.380 --> 43:37.983
And the only way for
that to happen is, um--

43:42.721 --> 43:44.856
Buffy, the only way
is to kill Dawn.

44:25.931 --> 44:27.699
Grr! Arrgh!
