booze to a baby.

00:39.065 --> 00:40.634

01:31.726 --> 01:33.591

- Has a wallet.

01:34.564 --> 01:35.997
Anything else, Mr. Alexander?

Shit, man.

02:10.871 --> 02:12.305
Hey, man!

Wow, shit, man!

02:16.945 --> 02:18.811

02:19.482 --> 02:21.517
- Where did you get that thing?
- I do not know, it was here

02:21.517 --> 02:22.814
It was on the fucking ground, allright?

02:29.026 --> 02:30.790
- To the ground ! Freeze!
- Hold it!

02:31.663 --> 02:33.398
It's not my gun !
It's not my gun !

02:33.398 --> 02:34.387

Hold it ! Stay on the ground !

02:42.509 --> 02:44.841
Jake, get down! Jake!

02:51.386 --> 02:53.821

- Shut up ! Stay on the ground !

02:53.821 --> 02:56.458
Speak to them, Jake!
We did nothing !

02:56.458 --> 02:57.982
Face to the floor, now!

02:58.560 --> 03:00.893
Turn around! Hands back.

03:01.831 --> 03:02.855
I'll kill you.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.897
You little shit.

03:05.769 --> 03:07.499
You killed my partner.

03:09.607 --> 03:11.507
He is dead. You hear me?

03:11.842 --> 03:14.505
I'll kill you, you piece of shit.

04:33.838 --> 04:35.328
Yes, sir.

04:36.875 --> 04:39.743
I'm Ryan Maygold. I'll be

04:46.953 --> 04:48.477

"Moby Dick."

04:52.560 --> 04:54.460

04:56.063 --> 04:59.067
It says here at the time of your arrest
your were living with your grandmother ...

04:59.067 --> 05:01.558
Dorothy McGwire on Robinson Street.

05:01.703 --> 05:02.932
Have you spoken to her?

05:03.139 --> 05:05.403
She died. Four years ago.

05:07.343 --> 05:08.935
And Connie McGwire?

05:10.047 --> 05:12.811
She moved to California
when I was 12.

05:16.154 --> 05:19.555
Here is a list of places that
the city compiled in 1988.

05:19.658 --> 05:21.593
They were hiring at
the time, then ...

05:21.994 --> 05:23.052
Good luck with that.

05:25.631 --> 05:28.402
The state of Louisiana enacted
a period of parole ...

05:28.402 --> 05:30.871
lasting no less than a
year, and no more than three.

05:30.871 --> 05:34.142

05:36.478 --> 05:38.844
don't blow shit up,
no fly to Yemen.

05:38.980 --> 05:40.710
I'll begin your paperwork ...

05:41.050 --> 05:44.653
and if no one sets fire to himself
in the next three hours ...

05:44.653 --> 05:46.554
we should have you processed.

05:47.491 --> 05:48.890
Welcome to the show.

05:49.659 --> 05:52.196
Curfew at 22.30
unless you have ...

05:52.196 --> 05:53.631
a work permit.

05:53.631 --> 05:57.067
No drugs, no booze, no girls.

05:58.537 --> 06:00.437
Last guy left some food.

06:01.206 --> 06:03.642
If the bed is too hard
just call the room service ...

06:03.642 --> 06:04.905
they will send another.

06:07.413 --> 06:09.381
Here you go, man. Good luck

06:36.648 --> 06:39.014
- Yes?
- Police open.

06:41.420 --> 06:42.751
hands up.

06:46.725 --> 06:48.057
Welcome back, kid.

06:48.862 --> 06:49.954
What's up?

06:50.196 --> 06:51.993
You look good, man.

06:53.801 --> 06:55.735
Still smells like piss in here.

06:56.671 --> 06:58.138
I brought you this.

06:58.639 --> 07:00.870
I know you have nothing when you get out.

07:02.744 --> 07:04.473
- Thanks.
- Yes

07:08.418 --> 07:09.715
Look ...

07:10.787 --> 07:12.779
Sorry not to have come and visit.

07:14.558 --> 07:17.584
I do not know, couldn't take myself
back to those gates, you know?

07:20.765 --> 07:22.801
Man, I can't believe it's you sitting in here.

07:22.801 --> 07:25.737
How often did we dream about this while sitting
in that cage, huh?

07:26.973 --> 07:29.669
- How's work?
- Nothing yet.

07:30.076 --> 07:32.807
Yeah. It's quite bleak out here
but I got it.

07:33.113 --> 07:34.478
I talked to my Uncle Lenny ...

07:35.616 --> 07:38.142
he can take you. You know,
he's looking for help.

07:38.453 --> 07:39.750
-Yeah ?
- Yeah.

07:40.088 --> 07:42.056
That'll help a lot.
Thanks, man.

07:43.392 --> 07:44.586
Come on. let's go.

07:46.495 --> 07:47.587
Where?

07:48.765 --> 07:50.665
I wanna see if you still got it

08:07.820 --> 08:09.756
Hey, Don, started yet ?

08:09.756 --> 08:11.519
- Second round, man.
- Beautiful.

08:14.995 --> 08:18.123
Let's welcome these two fighters.
Come on, make some noise!

08:22.937 --> 08:25.541
I want to remind you that we do
this every Friday night ...

08:25.541 --> 08:26.872
Here in Texas Club.

08:27.376 --> 08:28.775
Bayou's fights !

08:29.111 --> 08:30.544
What is this ?

08:30.980 --> 08:32.616
this's the minor leagues.

08:32.616 --> 08:34.885
See what happens in these
cages, and see what I'm talking about.

08:34.885 --> 08:36.511
Ready for round two.

08:41.859 --> 08:42.883
You ready?

08:43.061 --> 08:44.393
You ready?

08:44.630 --> 08:45.654
Fight!

08:52.205 --> 08:53.673
this is legit'?

08:53.673 --> 08:55.937
Yes, they bring in 5000 dollars a week.

08:56.210 --> 08:58.178
That's not counting the side action.

09:04.953 --> 09:08.081
I have a system that breaks down each fighter's strengths
and weaknesses.

09:08.624 --> 09:09.682
foolproof.

09:14.732 --> 09:16.597
Thank you. I'll get you back.

09:17.401 --> 09:20.063
Here. To the rise of the employ.

09:20.805 --> 09:22.966
I know that guy. the black in the corner.

09:24.576 --> 09:26.444
He a monster.

09:26.444 --> 09:28.147
We were in high school together. He was a great wrestler.

09:28.147 --> 09:29.478
He is.

09:31.484 --> 09:33.112
He has a lot of respect around here.

09:45.667 --> 09:47.100
- Who was that?
- Who?

09:47.703 --> 09:48.897
The big guy.

09:49.004 --> 09:51.439
Ace Reed. He thinks he's Stringer Bell.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.507
- Who?
- Stringer Bell. From "The Wire."

09:54.778 --> 09:56.439
He sells a lot of coke.

09:56.813 --> 09:59.442
- And the cops ?
- You've got to pay your taxes.

09:59.650 --> 10:01.083
Hey, Rix, how do you feel ?

10:03.755 --> 10:05.814
Always bet on Jim LA's horse.

10:06.024 --> 10:08.660
He used to be a number one contender
until he blew his leg.

10:08.660 --> 10:09.753
Come on.

10:25.880 --> 10:28.577
Hey, Larry! What's the deal?

10:33.923 --> 10:36.119
Give me two out and one on Tim money

10:40.865 --> 10:42.127
Come on! Come on!

10:44.936 --> 10:47.565
Two hundred! This system right there!

10:48.106 --> 10:49.505
can't do, Jake. can't do.

10:49.641 --> 10:51.844
You can't do what? I've not fucking greased up yet.

10:51.844 --> 10:53.847
Ace's calling the chips,
you have no more credit.

10:53.847 --> 10:54.848
Oh, come on.

10:54.848 --> 10:56.748
I should not even be paying
you on this fight.

10:57.984 --> 10:59.179
Sorry, Jake.

11:02.957 --> 11:04.158
are you allright?

11:04.158 --> 11:06.595
Yes Larry hasn't been the same since
his wife left him ...

11:06.595 --> 11:08.187
'cause he has a small pecker.

11:08.964 --> 11:10.192
Truth hurts.

11:11.701 --> 11:13.066
Your winner ...

11:14.003 --> 11:16.437
Now with a record of 9 to 4 ...

11:18.709 --> 11:21.803
Ray Smithies!

11:22.446 --> 11:23.607
Justin, Justin!

11:23.781 --> 11:25.078
Hey, tough break, man.

11:26.718 --> 11:28.583
You know my boy, Dillon McGwire?

11:29.087 --> 11:31.557
Sure. How you man doing, eh?

11:31.557 --> 11:33.787
'm allright. you did well in there.

11:33.893 --> 11:36.454
just lost focus, man. just one second.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.159
you know how it is.

11:38.632 --> 11:41.534
just as wrestling. Except you get to punch the guy.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.594
- Well, it was a hell of a fight, man.
-.

11:45.106 --> 11:47.608
- I warned you about the reverse, didn't I ?
- I thought ...

11:47.608 --> 11:49.975
No, no, no. You don't think, you do.

11:50.512 --> 11:52.748
You do what I say, then you win.

11:52.748 --> 11:55.240
When you do what you think, you fuckin'  lose.

11:55.652 --> 11:56.753
Look what happened.

11:56.753 --> 11:59.244
You had it in position,
right? What did I say?

11:59.789 --> 12:02.693
I said : "stay close,
elbow !". didn't I ?

12:02.693 --> 12:05.491
What did you do? You sat straight up and got reverse.

12:05.896 --> 12:07.888
And threw away a lot of money here.

12:07.999 --> 12:09.466
It cost me big.

12:13.239 --> 12:16.731
Your cut.. Your  cage fee's mine.
You have a nice day.

12:19.746 --> 12:22.738
Hey! We gonna work on that nose or what?

12:23.116 --> 12:24.778
Come on, let's get out of here.

12:25.186 --> 12:26.813
Good to see you, man.

12:27.088 --> 12:28.578
Hang in there, Justin.

12:32.895 --> 12:34.863
Wait, wait. Where are you going?

12:35.064 --> 12:36.497
Curfew.

12:36.732 --> 12:39.896
Oh, man. I know that was tough
to watch, but ...

12:40.203 --> 12:42.671
But, you know, Justin
has a point.

12:43.274 --> 12:45.208
You'd be a monster in that cage.

12:45.943 --> 12:48.104
didn't look much
like wrestling to me...

12:48.679 --> 12:51.216
You were All American, you were national
champion. I mean ...

12:51.216 --> 12:52.951
we'd make a lot of scratch
if you'd be fighting.

12:52.951 --> 12:55.216
- We?
- I saw scouts in there.

12:55.621 --> 12:58.647
USMMA, Crush, UFC.

12:59.158 --> 13:02.563
We could run for it. I could be your manager.
I Could help you train.

13:02.563 --> 13:03.964
It's not for me, man.

13:03.964 --> 13:05.632
Ah, come on, man, it's just...

13:05.632 --> 13:09.535
it's wrestling mixed with
a little bit of punching

13:11.639 --> 13:13.608
You are the best wrestler in the world.

13:14.143 --> 13:15.770
I gotta get going.

13:17.713 --> 13:19.850
it's cool, man. Stay and
watch the fights.

13:19.850 --> 13:21.078
Allright, see you in the morning?

13:22.252 --> 13:24.049
I'll give you a lift to work.

13:24.488 --> 13:26.889
- Thanks, but I think ...
- Hey, hey, it's legit.

13:27.058 --> 13:28.753
I'm just gonna take you down there.

13:29.127 --> 13:30.958
Text me when you're ready.

13:32.264 --> 13:33.731
Text ?

13:34.733 --> 13:38.171
Forget it, Rip Van Winkle. A lot
has changed since you've been inside.

13:38.171 --> 13:40.571
Why just not be ready for 08h00 ?

13:41.808 --> 13:43.036
Allright.

13:43.643 --> 13:44.906
Hey.

13:46.947 --> 13:48.574
Welcome back, kid.

14:14.112 --> 14:16.115
- Police! On the floor!
- What?

14:16.115 --> 14:17.514
I said now!

14:20.219 --> 14:22.989
- You holding ha? ?
- No!

14:22.989 --> 14:24.422
How are you doing, partner?

14:25.192 --> 14:27.957
Remember me? I
bet you do.

14:30.531 --> 14:31.725
There it is.

14:33.702 --> 14:36.205
Oh sorry ! That is Detective Spencer.

14:36.205 --> 14:38.807
We thought we'd just come by
and say welcome back.

14:38.807 --> 14:40.009
Welcome, douche bag.

14:40.009 --> 14:44.614
You know, I think it's great you and Jakey
are still together after all these years.

14:44.614 --> 14:46.884
You two are regular Bonnie and Clyde.

14:46.884 --> 14:48.219
Tell me something ...

14:48.219 --> 14:50.254
those three extra years you had ...

14:50.254 --> 14:53.156
was it hard to be away from
your boyfriend all that time?

14:53.725 --> 14:55.192
I bet it was.

14:55.927 --> 14:59.557
But that's what you get when you breaks
a guy's neck.

15:04.938 --> 15:06.963
I owe you

15:15.683 --> 15:16.946
See you later.

16:09.746 --> 16:11.772
BEVERAGES, WINE
COLD BEER

16:20.793 --> 16:21.851
This it it.

16:22.895 --> 16:25.990
are you serious ?
A liquor store?

16:27.067 --> 16:29.058
Hey, it's a job, get over it.

16:29.269 --> 16:30.738
He knows that you are coming.

16:30.738 --> 16:32.569
Tell him that you talked to me.

16:32.773 --> 16:34.468
What, you're not coming in?

16:34.575 --> 16:36.942
No, I got some business across
town.

16:40.048 --> 16:42.540
you're good, don't worry about it.
Everything is set up.

17:01.774 --> 17:03.036
Can I help you ?

17:04.777 --> 17:07.679
Yes I'm Dillon.
Jake's friend.

17:08.882 --> 17:10.450
Yes?

17:10.450 --> 17:12.577
He said he might
have a job.

17:13.121 --> 17:14.179
Yes.

17:17.692 --> 17:18.893
I can come back later.

17:18.893 --> 17:21.657
- Can you lift 30 pound boxes?
- Yes

17:22.097 --> 17:24.429
What does it say on the box behind you?

17:26.670 --> 17:28.569
- Vodka?
- Allright.

17:28.772 --> 17:31.642
I can give you two nights
and two days, will that work?

17:31.642 --> 17:33.576
Yes That would be great.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.444
Good

17:36.914 --> 17:38.016
When shall I start?

17:38.016 --> 17:40.985
You can move those boxes in the back next to the rhum.

17:53.867 --> 17:55.027
Hey, Len.

17:57.939 --> 17:59.099
Sorry.

17:59.741 --> 18:00.901
Amy?

18:03.179 --> 18:06.012
- it's been a long time.
- Yes

18:06.849 --> 18:08.985
Looks like you put your time to good use.

18:08.985 --> 18:10.543
you are a doctor now?

18:13.256 --> 18:15.487
I am looking for my Uncle Lenny.

18:17.929 --> 18:19.055
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:20.866 --> 18:22.731
- How was class?
- It was good.

18:23.669 --> 18:26.906
I just wanted to stop by and see
if you had eaten anything today.

18:26.906 --> 18:29.670
- I'm not really hungry.
- Well, you have to eat.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.111
Let's go at Ann Marie's.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.842
- I got to close up.
- All right, I can wait.

18:37.118 --> 18:39.485
Hey Dillon, come here.

18:41.523 --> 18:43.718
Here. That's for today.

18:44.192 --> 18:48.164
Now, buy some black pants,
a couple collar shirts.

18:48.164 --> 18:50.758
When tomorrow comes, fill
in a time card.

18:51.268 --> 18:53.065
Payday's every Friday.

18:54.204 --> 18:55.603
Thank you.

19:05.484 --> 19:07.853
I can't believeyou let Dillon
McGwire work here.

19:07.853 --> 19:09.188
He did his time.

19:09.188 --> 19:11.623
Did Jake make you do this?

19:12.125 --> 19:15.219
- Everybody's gotta eat.
- What's that supposed to mean?

19:15.730 --> 19:18.221
It means I'm starving. Let's go.

19:40.292 --> 19:42.055
- Sorry to have come here.
- Stop.

19:42.294 --> 19:43.784
The fight is tonight.

19:44.196 --> 19:45.297
Is that the Delaudid?

19:45.297 --> 19:46.993
- Who is it?
- What?

19:47.934 --> 19:49.101
Who do you owe now?

19:49.101 --> 19:50.937
What ?  I need to pay rent.

19:50.937 --> 19:52.462
Who?

19:53.974 --> 19:55.236
Ace.

19:56.677 --> 19:57.811
are you kidding me?

19:57.811 --> 19:59.814
Relax, sis, I have
it under control.

19:59.814 --> 20:01.042
you have it under control?

20:01.549 --> 20:03.779
- What the hell are you doing?
- That's the last time.

20:04.085 --> 20:05.849
You are unbelievable.

20:08.023 --> 20:10.857
I'll be home early, right?
Do not worry.

20:12.562 --> 20:14.052
I've got it.

20:21.038 --> 20:22.062
Shit!

20:23.075 --> 20:24.064
Jake!

20:24.543 --> 20:25.669
My God.

20:33.553 --> 20:34.577
Lenny!

20:36.624 --> 20:37.886
Lenny!

20:38.626 --> 20:39.854
Lenny!

20:46.902 --> 20:49.338
- You are well?
- Have you seen my uncle?

20:49.338 --> 20:50.930
He went out. What's wrong?

20:54.912 --> 20:56.607
They took Jake.

20:56.813 --> 20:58.081
Who?

20:58.081 --> 21:00.050
- Ace.
- Ace Reed?

21:00.818 --> 21:02.683
Jake owes him a lot of money.

21:04.656 --> 21:07.649
I waited in the house because
I thought that they might... but...

21:07.993 --> 21:10.120
- I can't go to the cops.
- Allright, Allright.

21:10.329 --> 21:12.161
Right. How do I find Ace?

21:13.833 --> 21:16.097
He has this place on Choctaw.

21:22.043 --> 21:23.077
Can you take me there?

21:23.077 --> 21:25.046
- you can't just walk in there ...
- Please.

21:25.213 --> 21:26.680
Just take me there.

21:32.188 --> 21:33.655
Okay, go home.

21:36.292 --> 21:37.817
What are you gonna do?

21:38.862 --> 21:40.693
It's gonna be okay.

21:41.332 --> 21:42.857
Go home.

21:50.276 --> 21:52.039
I'm here to see the Ace.

22:41.168 --> 22:42.636
How much does he owe ?

22:42.636 --> 22:44.161
Hey. How much?

22:47.242 --> 22:48.709
How much?

22:49.310 --> 22:50.778
Twenty.

22:50.980 --> 22:53.574
Twenty thousand. Got it?

22:55.251 --> 22:57.152
It doesn't look like he has that long...

23:00.390 --> 23:02.882
There's only two ways he's rollin' outta here.

23:03.261 --> 23:06.196
Dog food or my cash.

23:07.298 --> 23:08.891
I'll pay it.

23:09.201 --> 23:10.969
I'll pay the twenty thousand.

23:10.969 --> 23:13.238
No. Interest.

23:13.238 --> 23:14.763
It's thirty.

23:16.776 --> 23:18.004
Fine.

23:19.879 --> 23:23.008
What are you two - like lovers or something?
It's gotta be love.

23:23.150 --> 23:25.277
- I'm gonna need some time.
- No, partner.

23:25.586 --> 23:27.282
ain't no layout plan

23:27.756 --> 23:30.156
I need my cash,
and need it now.

23:34.831 --> 23:36.264
I will fight.

23:36.833 --> 23:39.097
- At the Texas Club.
- At the Texas ...

23:40.037 --> 23:42.272
No, they don't pay like that down there.

23:42.272 --> 23:44.074
What will you make? like a thousand  a win?

23:44.074 --> 23:46.168
Not if you bet on me.

23:46.344 --> 23:48.244
Hey. He's the best.

23:48.580 --> 23:49.945
He was All American.

23:50.815 --> 23:52.084
- Fuck !
- You know what?

23:52.084 --> 23:54.848
- I'm gonna kill your ass right now.
- Then you don't get paid pay.

23:57.256 --> 23:58.849
I'll win.

23:58.992 --> 24:00.789
It's on me.

24:03.330 --> 24:04.923
I know you.

24:05.533 --> 24:08.559
- Where do I know you from?
- We went to high school together.

24:10.239 --> 24:12.673
Yes You the wrestler that has
killed the guy.

24:14.777 --> 24:17.246
You know what? Let's do it.

24:17.614 --> 24:19.081
This should be fun.

24:19.716 --> 24:21.946
Three fights. That's what you owe.

24:22.153 --> 24:24.555
You win me three fights and we're good.

24:24.555 --> 24:27.888
You lose... you, you ...

24:28.192 --> 24:31.253
and that trim you rolled up with ...
gonna get dead.

24:31.329 --> 24:32.819
Are we clear?

24:33.598 --> 24:35.726
- I said, are we clear?
- We're clear.

24:38.771 --> 24:40.068
Cut him down.

24:50.752 --> 24:53.119
Let me see him. Let me
see him. Come on.

24:53.222 --> 24:55.591
- Oh my God.
- No, no, no.

24:55.591 --> 24:56.683
Come on.

24:56.926 --> 24:58.553
I'll have to clean it up.

24:58.929 --> 25:00.226
Let me see.

25:03.900 --> 25:05.493
The "Kid" est back.

25:21.054 --> 25:23.557
it's not just wrestling. You have
to keep your hands up.

25:23.557 --> 25:24.892
You've got to keep your head in it.

25:24.892 --> 25:26.723
Don't get pressed against the cage.

25:46.617 --> 25:48.920
breathe in now, just breathe, just breathe.

25:48.920 --> 25:50.615
You're good. you're good

25:51.189 --> 25:54.956
Okay,Listen to me. If you get
on top, follow through.

25:55.094 --> 25:57.930
fist, elbow, fist,
elbow. But hey ...

25:57.930 --> 25:59.765
don't make it about the punches, right?

25:59.765 --> 26:02.667
Use wrestling. Find
leverage, take him down.

26:02.869 --> 26:04.671
Remember the knee bar
that showed you?

26:04.671 --> 26:05.739
Remember the neck crank?

26:05.739 --> 26:08.106
Remember all that?
Hey! you good ?

26:12.179 --> 26:14.080
Come on, I'll fix you up ok?

26:16.118 --> 26:18.713
Look at me. No worry
about it. Focus.

26:20.623 --> 26:23.293
You Philly the Kid, baby. You
Philly the Kid, right?

26:23.293 --> 26:26.286
Philly ... the Kid, Dillon McGwire!

26:41.080 --> 26:42.069
Shirt.

26:42.615 --> 26:44.584
Okay, rookie, only two rules.

26:44.785 --> 26:48.346
One,someone taps out, you go to
your corner, fight's over.

26:48.622 --> 26:50.921
Second rule, don't die on me, bro.

26:51.859 --> 26:53.918
I've got a lot more fights after this.

27:01.403 --> 27:03.599
- Whose that?
- Mine.

27:17.889 --> 27:19.015
Gentlemen.

27:21.861 --> 27:23.363
Listen to me, it's three
three minute rounds.

27:23.363 --> 27:25.098
If I call it,we're done.

27:25.098 --> 27:27.033
If the bell rings, we're done. Understood?

27:27.634 --> 27:28.969
Ok. Touch gloves.

27:28.969 --> 27:30.800
In your corners, wait for my signal.

27:32.172 --> 27:34.209

27:34.209 --> 27:37.076

28:15.022 --> 28:16.149
Hands up!

28:45.024 --> 28:46.159
Come on!

28:46.159 --> 28:48.650
And that's the end of round one.

28:49.029 --> 28:51.589
We'll be back at the beginning
of round two.

28:54.202 --> 28:55.601
Open, open.

29:00.309 --> 29:01.298

29:04.012 --> 29:05.503
D, you good?

29:32.913 --> 29:33.937
You ready?

29:34.181 --> 29:35.308
You ready?

29:35.617 --> 29:36.777
Fight!

30:36.721 --> 30:37.745
Finished!

30:39.324 --> 30:40.757
Finished!

30:49.736 --> 30:52.136
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

30:53.106 --> 30:54.474
you allright ?

30:54.474 --> 30:56.711
Look at me. Ok, let's get out.

30:56.711 --> 30:59.009
Let's go, let's
go. Come on.

31:06.889 --> 31:09.915
The winner, Dillon McGwire!

31:15.966 --> 31:17.126
you allright?

31:17.268 --> 31:18.667
you good ?

31:19.804 --> 31:21.135
What you're fuckin' lookin' at?

31:24.709 --> 31:25.677
Come on.

31:27.246 --> 31:29.806
It's not the worst thing I've ever seen.

31:30.650 --> 31:32.380
But I can't stitch it.

31:32.653 --> 31:34.154
Keep it clean.

31:34.154 --> 31:36.622
And if it swells too much, get it looked at.

31:37.457 --> 31:39.756
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Doc.

31:40.228 --> 31:43.026
Was I right? Huh?
was I right?

31:45.167 --> 31:46.293
Tell me ...

31:46.869 --> 31:48.359
Why'd you bite your tongue?

31:48.971 --> 31:51.099
Football coaches
down South ...

31:51.374 --> 31:55.105
teach your players to bite
alngua before blocking punds.

31:55.779 --> 31:57.882
The blood drives them
crazy on adrenalin ...

31:57.882 --> 31:59.784
but also scares the shit
out of the other team.

31:59.784 --> 32:02.652
But I've got a pretty good feeling
you knew that already.

32:05.090 --> 32:06.819
Bring him by my place tomorrow.

32:12.732 --> 32:13.994
What did I tell you?

32:14.100 --> 32:15.269
One fight.

32:15.269 --> 32:18.761
One fight and LA Jim wants to talk to you.

32:19.907 --> 32:22.638
That's what I'm talking about, baby.
That's what I'm talking about.

32:22.711 --> 32:24.144
No laying, huh?

32:25.413 --> 32:27.609
You're a mean son of a bitch.

32:29.752 --> 32:31.219
I like it though.

32:31.654 --> 32:33.247
I like that a lot.

32:33.990 --> 32:35.321
Jake.

32:36.326 --> 32:38.089
Get him another fight.

32:40.765 --> 32:41.891
Quick.

32:43.334 --> 32:44.736
Keep your head up straight.

32:44.736 --> 32:47.228
Just two more and we're through. We clear ?

32:49.174 --> 32:50.971
I said, are we clear ?

32:53.713 --> 32:55.146
Wild man.

32:58.486 --> 33:00.215
Take care of my horse, Jake.

33:00.788 --> 33:02.187
See you soon.

33:35.996 --> 33:37.122
here?

33:37.264 --> 33:38.822
Pope polish?

33:38.999 --> 33:41.169
Trust me. This guy's the real deal.

33:41.169 --> 33:44.070
Here. That's for your win
last night.

33:56.019 --> 33:57.350
Big time.

33:58.722 --> 34:01.384
Hey, guys. Thanks for coming down.

34:01.725 --> 34:02.693
No problem.

34:02.693 --> 34:04.228
Why don't you and I take a walk ?

34:04.228 --> 34:06.959
- Murray has some papers for you to sign.
- Hey.

34:07.699 --> 34:09.257
saw you came from Drexel.

34:09.900 --> 34:11.164
You are good.

34:12.205 --> 34:15.606
Last night you were something
... different.

34:16.909 --> 34:19.811
- How long a strech did you do ?
- Ten years.

34:22.349 --> 34:23.908
You know what I do ?

34:24.219 --> 34:26.244
- Train fighters.
- No.

34:26.920 --> 34:28.616
I Train the best.

34:29.190 --> 34:32.752
And the best all have that animal
I saw in you last night.

34:32.895 --> 34:34.260
But that's not enough.

34:34.429 --> 34:36.399
See, right now you can get on the ground with anyone.

34:36.399 --> 34:37.991
you just can't get him there.

34:38.268 --> 34:40.759
You've gotta learn how to stand up and fight.

34:41.371 --> 34:43.203
Become a complete fighter.

34:44.208 --> 34:47.335
'cos that's what separates
the street rats from the best.

34:48.313 --> 34:49.712
You gotta want it.

34:51.149 --> 34:52.844
Or eventually ...

34:54.120 --> 34:55.815
You won't walk out

34:59.759 --> 35:02.126
Remember when everyone
used to know his name?

35:02.329 --> 35:04.160
"Dillon, you the man!"

35:06.033 --> 35:09.333
You train with me and I'll get
you back there.

35:10.272 --> 35:12.639
- What's in it for you ?
- Twenty percent.

35:12.775 --> 35:14.868
You fight who I say
when I say.

35:15.711 --> 35:17.146
I don't think I'm in the fighter
you are looking for.

35:17.146 --> 35:18.705
Well, I don't know if you are either.

35:19.116 --> 35:22.210
But after what I saw last
night, and from what I know ...

35:22.853 --> 35:24.879
I think you owe to yourself to find out.

35:28.259 --> 35:29.749
When do we start ?

35:31.797 --> 35:33.924
- You've got a girl?
- No.

35:35.034 --> 35:36.433
Go get one tonight.

35:37.938 --> 35:40.634
'cause tomorrow, your legs are mine.

35:41.975 --> 35:44.103
Girls are like kryptonite
to legs.

35:45.746 --> 35:47.236
7am tomorrow morning.

35:47.481 --> 35:49.313
Make sure you eat something before.

35:56.793 --> 35:58.021
What did he say?

35:58.962 --> 36:01.157
- Eat breakfast.
- What else?

36:01.999 --> 36:03.300
And to get laid.

36:03.300 --> 36:05.029
That's what I'm talking about!

36:05.169 --> 36:07.103
- Here.
- What's that?

36:07.271 --> 36:10.764
You now belong LA Jim Inc. Management

36:17.216 --> 36:19.275
Hey huh, how's the fishing?

36:20.287 --> 36:22.356
Relax. it's just a job check.

36:22.356 --> 36:24.790
A little like a prostate check,
but without the lube.

36:25.425 --> 36:26.791
I brought coffee.

36:32.935 --> 36:34.664
What happened to your knuckles?

36:39.209 --> 36:40.870
Loading boxes?

36:41.845 --> 36:43.005
Yes.

36:43.813 --> 36:45.975
you've loaded boxes with
your face, too?

36:48.386 --> 36:50.756
So, do you need to talk to
my boss or something?

36:50.756 --> 36:52.018
No.

36:52.090 --> 36:53.990
Just checking a box here.

36:58.297 --> 37:00.663
- How are you doing?
- Here?

37:01.000 --> 37:03.629
Here, there, everywhere.
How's the world?

37:04.805 --> 37:05.999
It's fine.

37:09.344 --> 37:10.834
It's different.

37:12.847 --> 37:14.644
Did four in Iraq.

37:15.184 --> 37:18.415
Came home, felt like I'd
been to Mars and back.

37:20.990 --> 37:22.322
Give it time.

37:22.659 --> 37:25.025
Find something that matters.
Hold on tight.

37:27.097 --> 37:28.861
Look what it did for me, right?

37:31.202 --> 37:32.760
Allright.

37:33.171 --> 37:34.434
Back to work.

37:35.007 --> 37:37.237
- Next time?
- Yes

37:40.080 --> 37:41.672
Watch out for them boxes.

37:55.997 --> 37:57.055
Hi

37:58.101 --> 38:01.003
Sorry, sorry. I didn't want
to surprise you.

38:01.003 --> 38:03.198
- it's all right, i've got it.
- No, let me help you.

38:03.840 --> 38:06.309
Gotta stop entering in the
back like a criminal.

38:07.244 --> 38:08.734
Shit, sorry.

38:10.348 --> 38:11.906
Your uncle isn't here.

38:15.353 --> 38:17.049
No, actually ...

38:19.091 --> 38:20.956
I never got to say ...

38:21.794 --> 38:23.285
Thank you.

38:27.934 --> 38:30.130
- I heard you won.
- Yes

38:33.841 --> 38:35.901
I'm sorry that he
did this to you.

38:36.178 --> 38:37.668
it's allright.

38:37.746 --> 38:39.179
No it's not.

38:39.815 --> 38:41.875
I'll just do it for him.

38:43.086 --> 38:46.852
Hey, at least I wasn't asked
to win a beauty pageant.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.686
So, is it true what my
brother told me?

38:53.165 --> 38:55.827
- You never lost?
- Yeah.

38:56.268 --> 38:57.860
You must be pretty good.

38:58.370 --> 39:00.066
You should come and watch.

39:00.439 --> 39:02.304
I don't really like fighting.

39:06.013 --> 39:08.914
Well, I gotta go. I have
to catch the bus.

39:11.285 --> 39:13.413
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

39:16.825 --> 39:19.420
- How about Italian food?
- What ?

39:19.762 --> 39:22.287
- Do you like Italian food?
- Yes

39:22.731 --> 39:26.691
Because I'm about to close up here and there's
this really great place up on Eliyson.

39:28.104 --> 39:30.733
That place hasn't been up there
for like, five years.

39:34.011 --> 39:36.139
But there's this great place on Broad.

39:59.841 --> 40:02.811
Hey, man, It's me.
You're missing your party.

40:03.412 --> 40:06.381
I know you're not working right now,
because I know you're closed.

40:06.850 --> 40:09.284
So, er, get your ass down here.

40:13.791 --> 40:15.986
It is a celebration.

40:30.477 --> 40:31.968
Look at this nut.

40:32.380 --> 40:35.713
No work, no technique.
The guy's an amateur.

40:38.086 --> 40:39.451
What a hack.

40:40.088 --> 40:43.258
They got this guy, Powell, fighting
sticks so that they can build ...

40:43.258 --> 40:46.319
- A money horse.
- Hey! Turn that shit off!

40:47.797 --> 40:50.028
It's the guy who stays on his feet who wins.

40:50.534 --> 40:53.901
It's the guy can still punch while
the other can't breathe.

40:56.541 --> 40:59.999
Oh, I'm sorry,can I get you
a lemonade or something?

41:00.378 --> 41:02.006
Hit that fucking thing!

41:02.214 --> 41:03.841
A hundred times! Let's go!

41:05.952 --> 41:08.021
- What do winners never do?
- Quit !

41:08.021 --> 41:09.045
Hit it!

41:10.924 --> 41:11.891
Now!

41:12.526 --> 41:13.891
Aim for the head!

41:26.308 --> 41:27.298
Now!

41:52.539 --> 41:53.972
Get some rest.

41:56.477 --> 41:57.809
That's good.

41:59.047 --> 42:00.036
Now!

42:00.782 --> 42:01.806
this is it.

42:19.937 --> 42:20.961
Now!

42:29.215 --> 42:30.842
Ok, again!

42:35.890 --> 42:37.448
Ace's gotta approve it.

42:37.858 --> 42:39.917
Fuck Ace, ok?

42:40.228 --> 42:42.025
I'm not playing on credit.

42:42.097 --> 42:43.155
Take this.

42:43.565 --> 42:46.160
That's two thousand dollars
on my boy tomorrow.

42:46.436 --> 42:49.837
You hold onto it. I win, you pay
me what you owe me.

42:50.273 --> 42:52.036
Ace doesn't need to know.

42:52.141 --> 42:53.507
Leave it off the books.

42:54.278 --> 42:56.838
Larry, you need these ears.

42:57.448 --> 43:00.385
I know these fighters. I know
what your odds should be. Come on.

43:00.385 --> 43:02.353
You help
me, I help you.

43:07.393 --> 43:09.725
- What's that?
- Oh My God.

43:10.831 --> 43:11.991
What ?

43:12.099 --> 43:13.964
O-M-G, that's what it means.

43:15.402 --> 43:17.462
OMG, I just sent my first text.

43:23.245 --> 43:24.269
McGwire.

43:24.546 --> 43:26.741
You really want to give me an excuse?

43:30.887 --> 43:32.218
What are you doing?

43:32.455 --> 43:35.493
- Hey, easy playboy.
- We didn't do anything !

43:35.493 --> 43:39.259
While I'm here, I want to give congratulations
on your big win. that's all.

43:39.463 --> 43:42.194
I hear you're with LA Jim now.
That's terrific.

43:42.901 --> 43:45.927
Just want to make sure
you don't get the big head.

43:47.272 --> 43:49.104
You still a piece of shit.

43:53.346 --> 43:55.042
- Fuck it!
- Easy, killer.

43:56.083 --> 43:57.380
Those fighters.

43:57.518 --> 43:59.543
They fight for me down there.

43:59.888 --> 44:02.356
Every breath you take in that ring ...

44:02.423 --> 44:04.448
That's a gift from ... me.

44:08.497 --> 44:10.294
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

44:11.867 --> 44:13.699
Keep 'em gloves up !

44:21.245 --> 44:22.439
- No.
- I'm sorry.

44:23.114 --> 44:25.743
- Are you ok ? Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

44:34.494 --> 44:37.191
Yes, that's ok. Snap it. Snap it.

44:38.399 --> 44:39.491
nice.

44:42.436 --> 44:44.506
Well, don't think, react.

44:44.506 --> 44:45.734
that's it.

44:49.445 --> 44:51.003
Break. Break !

44:52.248 --> 44:53.476
It's training.

44:55.452 --> 44:56.885
He's ready.

45:03.861 --> 45:05.226
Come on. Come on.

45:05.763 --> 45:06.821
that's it.

45:08.534 --> 45:10.331
Yes, good.

45:10.569 --> 45:12.867
Quick. The other hand.

45:14.007 --> 45:15.167
Good, good.

45:16.042 --> 45:19.136
The Philly Kid, Dillon McGwire!

45:30.892 --> 45:31.985
For luck.

45:41.505 --> 45:42.802
How's he looking ?

45:43.240 --> 45:44.868
He's looking ready.

45:45.810 --> 45:47.004
What does that mean?

45:47.212 --> 45:49.908
It means you should get ready
To pay up.

45:50.116 --> 45:51.583
Bring the pain, man.

45:58.258 --> 45:59.782
Hey, listen. listen.

46:00.294 --> 46:02.363
This jock will come up all flashy.

46:02.363 --> 46:03.796
Let him wear himself down.

46:03.898 --> 46:06.534
When I say "now", I want you
to hit it him so hard ...

46:06.534 --> 46:08.058
... that his kids will be pissing blood.

46:20.450 --> 46:21.509
Gentlemen.

46:24.355 --> 46:25.956
Okay, three three minute rounds.

46:25.956 --> 46:29.161
I call it, we're done.
the bell rings, we're done.

46:29.161 --> 46:30.423
Understand?

46:30.562 --> 46:33.828
Good. Touch gloves, go to your
corner, wait for my signal.

46:35.001 --> 46:36.093
you ready?

46:36.436 --> 46:37.801
you ready?

46:37.937 --> 46:38.961
Fight!

47:08.506 --> 47:09.838
Now!

47:17.517 --> 47:18.848
Oh, no!

47:46.483 --> 47:48.111
Hit, hit! He hit!

47:58.932 --> 48:02.231
And your winner, Dillon McGwire!

48:02.369 --> 48:03.927
That's what I'm talking about.

48:09.911 --> 48:11.243
Nice job!

48:20.423 --> 48:23.882
Hey, champ. Next
time, work a little sweat, huh ?

48:27.097 --> 48:28.155
Yeah !

48:42.483 --> 48:44.542
Hell of a horse you've got here, Jim.

48:47.054 --> 48:48.522
People are talking.

48:50.925 --> 48:52.256
Is that right ?

48:52.827 --> 48:55.126
Yes, they say the big boys are circling.

48:55.197 --> 48:57.358
Ready to bring you back to the top.

48:58.234 --> 49:00.260
You ready to do what it takes?

49:04.107 --> 49:05.301
Who?

49:06.344 --> 49:08.744
Dillon - Titov, in two weeks.

49:10.948 --> 49:12.473
What if I say no?

49:19.826 --> 49:21.555
He rules here, Jim.

49:21.928 --> 49:24.488
Nobody puts a foot on line without
paying their dues.

49:24.865 --> 49:26.389
I did it. Well ..

49:26.534 --> 49:28.900
You didn't, see where it got you.

49:31.907 --> 49:34.501
It is the way he becomes a contender, you know that.

49:34.843 --> 49:37.369
In two weeks, he goes down.

49:38.481 --> 49:41.143
But in one month, he gets his shot.

49:45.122 --> 49:47.113
CONDITIONAL OFFICE

49:49.192 --> 49:51.529
- You're looking for Ryan?
- Yes

49:51.529 --> 49:54.054
He's in the garage ...  with The Beast.

49:55.467 --> 49:56.491
Damn!

49:57.169 --> 49:58.466
What's wrong with it?

50:01.106 --> 50:04.277
It's 20 years old,
and I've got a shitty government salary.

50:04.277 --> 50:06.268
- Is it turning over?
- Yeah.

50:06.513 --> 50:08.149
it's probably the battery.

50:08.149 --> 50:10.242
Can I see the Phillips wrench ?

50:14.489 --> 50:16.150
I already tried the connection.

50:23.933 --> 50:25.195
Okay, try it now.

50:26.570 --> 50:28.003
Try it now?

50:32.544 --> 50:34.409
I was a Marine, you know?

50:34.546 --> 50:35.981
I'm trying now.

50:35.981 --> 50:38.348
I wiped the sand from the intake valve ...

50:39.585 --> 50:42.918
The distributor cap's loose.
You're gonna have to replace it eventually.

50:43.889 --> 50:46.290
There was a trade
program in Angola.

50:47.160 --> 50:49.287
You're a fascinating character,
you know that?

50:50.530 --> 50:52.465
Gotta go pick up my little girl.

50:52.934 --> 50:55.664
- Should I come back?
- Your work is done here, go in peace.

50:59.375 --> 51:00.569
Come on, that's it.

51:01.377 --> 51:03.243

51:09.220 --> 51:10.482
Come on!

51:11.088 --> 51:12.350
Are you quitting ?

51:12.990 --> 51:14.225
You're holding back on me?

51:14.225 --> 51:16.387
You're holding back on yourself ?
You coward!

51:17.195 --> 51:19.322
Yes ! That's it !

51:19.564 --> 51:21.362
this. That's what I wanna see.

51:22.168 --> 51:26.127
You will not always be the best
l, that we cannot escape.

51:26.973 --> 51:28.999
But you're a fucking monster inside.

51:29.643 --> 51:31.133
Let it out.

51:33.213 --> 51:34.374
Come on!

51:35.950 --> 51:36.974
Fall!

51:39.120 --> 51:40.145

52:03.615 --> 52:06.352
This Allison Kaufman
Crush MMA circuit.

52:06.352 --> 52:08.922
Miss Kaufman, this is "the" LA Jim.

52:08.922 --> 52:10.891
He turns pretenders
into contenders.

52:10.891 --> 52:13.027
Jim, I'm such a huge fan of yours.

52:13.027 --> 52:15.563
I saw you fight Gracie
Back in Newport Beach.

52:15.563 --> 52:17.532
- What can I do for you?
- I represent Crush.

52:17.532 --> 52:20.135
We've been watching Dillon for a while...
And we think ...

52:20.135 --> 52:21.403
he's gonna be a huge star.

52:21.403 --> 52:23.072
They want him to fight
"Titan" Powell.

52:23.072 --> 52:24.640
We think it would be
such a cool fight.

52:24.640 --> 52:25.875
In one month in Baton Rouge.

52:25.875 --> 52:28.611
Dillon's first fight where he
bites his tongue has more than ...

52:28.611 --> 52:30.512
a million hits on YouTube.

52:31.915 --> 52:33.610
- No.
- What ?

52:35.854 --> 52:39.657
Of course we provide
a 50000 dollar contract for the fight.

52:39.657 --> 52:42.928
He fights Titov. Then
the next step ...

52:42.928 --> 52:45.030
and then the next, until it is ready.

52:45.030 --> 52:48.602
Until he's ready? The guy is
destroying guys right now.

52:48.602 --> 52:50.433
He is not ready.

52:51.104 --> 52:52.706
He fights who I say, when I say.

52:52.706 --> 52:53.969
Jim.

52:54.275 --> 52:56.835
Seventy thousand dollars?

52:57.879 --> 52:59.973
- I'm not gonna ask again.
- Good

53:00.482 --> 53:02.006
Go talk to him, please.

53:02.317 --> 53:05.252
Just give me a minute. I'll
sort this out and you'll be ...

53:05.354 --> 53:06.990
... fighting Powell in a month.

53:06.990 --> 53:08.981
I only have to fight one more time.

53:09.526 --> 53:13.486
- Yes, but D. ..
- I only owe one more fight.

53:14.965 --> 53:16.330
And then what?

53:16.667 --> 53:18.436
you're going back to stacking boxes for Lenny?

53:18.436 --> 53:20.405
better than getting my face beated, yes.

53:20.405 --> 53:24.377
Look, man, Ace and Jim are the only
ones making money off your blood.

53:24.377 --> 53:25.578
When are we going to make us some?

53:25.578 --> 53:28.047
We have to turn the Philly Kid
into a global scheme ...

53:28.047 --> 53:29.878
The Philly Kid is dead!

53:29.949 --> 53:31.884
He died in prison.

53:32.953 --> 53:34.386
And "we"?

53:34.855 --> 53:36.448
You mean you.

53:36.524 --> 53:40.328
I took those fights
to pay off your debt.

53:40.328 --> 53:41.663
You understand that?

53:41.663 --> 53:43.291
you debt.

53:43.599 --> 53:46.466
I fight once more time
and that's where it ends.

53:49.539 --> 53:51.336
One more fight.

54:03.956 --> 54:07.290
- Where did you get 8000 dollars?
- You the IRS?

54:08.394 --> 54:11.295
Put it all on my boy
to break Titov in half.

54:11.564 --> 54:13.999
- Where did it come from?
- Come on, man.

54:15.436 --> 54:16.960
It's clean.

54:39.530 --> 54:41.532
LEAVES OF GRASS

54:41.532 --> 54:43.933
THEY ARE MY PAST NOT YOURS.
SORRY. - DILLON

54:59.720 --> 55:01.347
How's my horse feeling?

55:01.956 --> 55:03.025
He is ready.

55:03.025 --> 55:06.261
Good, good. We have a lot
of roll on this run now, don't we?

55:06.261 --> 55:07.592
Yes.

55:07.930 --> 55:11.560
- oh Jakey, good luck out there, you hear?
- Yes

55:23.348 --> 55:25.145
You're gonna murder this guy !

55:25.417 --> 55:27.113
You're gonna kill him !

55:27.219 --> 55:29.449
Hey! One minute!

55:30.589 --> 55:34.424
And next up, a fans' favorite,
it's gonna be good.

55:34.962 --> 55:39.491
Let's give a Texas Club welcome
to Dillon McGwire!

55:42.470 --> 55:43.596
Shoes.

55:46.308 --> 55:47.536
Gloves.

55:49.678 --> 55:52.842
With a record of 7 in 2 ...

55:53.683 --> 55:58.212
The Russian Monster , Andres Titov.

56:10.103 --> 56:15.302
USA! USA! USA!

56:17.277 --> 56:19.006
Remember the training, man.

56:36.700 --> 56:39.294
Touch gloves. Here comes
the first bell.

56:40.438 --> 56:41.462
Ready?

56:42.407 --> 56:43.465
Ready?

56:44.008 --> 56:45.532
- Fight!
- Go, Dillon!

57:23.488 --> 57:25.581
Hands up! Hands up!

57:27.158 --> 57:28.955
Move it, move it!

57:33.132 --> 57:35.191
Stay calm, D! Stay calm!

57:38.138 --> 57:39.298
Come on!

57:53.322 --> 57:54.585
Come on!

58:08.340 --> 58:10.108
That the end of round one.

58:10.108 --> 58:12.600
Let's give it to these guys,
Make some noise.

58:13.880 --> 58:15.882
- What is going on?
- I can't see anything.

58:15.882 --> 58:17.042
Wash him out.

58:17.984 --> 58:20.220
He's opening himself up every time
with that hook.

58:20.220 --> 58:21.522
Wait for it and then finish him.

58:21.522 --> 58:23.423
My eyes are burning,
I can't see a fucking thing.

58:23.423 --> 58:24.652
Wash it.

58:26.194 --> 58:28.628
Wait for the hook, you'll be fine.

58:31.400 --> 58:32.958
What's the champions never do?

58:33.068 --> 58:34.626
- Quit.
- Go get him.

58:49.154 --> 58:50.143
Fight!

59:06.307 --> 59:07.570
Come on, D!

59:08.376 --> 59:09.578
What are you doing?

59:09.578 --> 59:10.946
Stopping this fight,
he's not well today.

59:10.946 --> 59:12.380
No, no, no. don't stop, he's fine.

59:12.380 --> 59:13.575
He will kill him.

59:21.458 --> 59:22.550
Come on, D!

59:41.648 --> 59:44.618
Your winner and still undefeated ...

59:44.952 --> 59:47.216
Dillon McGwire!

59:48.389 --> 59:51.018
God, I love that
sweeper move.

59:51.627 --> 59:53.458
I didn't see this coming.

59:58.468 --> 01:00:00.936
- How does it look Doc?
- Like he's been drugged.

01:00:01.537 --> 01:00:02.869
What ?

01:00:03.007 --> 01:00:06.033
Probably Rohypnol or some
type of tranquilizer.

01:00:06.443 --> 01:00:07.911
Come on, no way !...

01:00:07.911 --> 01:00:11.316
I've been stitching fighters for 30 years,
I know when someone's micked.

01:00:11.316 --> 01:00:12.977
Russian immigrants, they are ...

01:00:14.386 --> 01:00:16.287
they're dirty and everybody knows it.

01:00:17.023 --> 01:00:18.724
Probably had some shit
in his gloves.

01:00:18.724 --> 01:00:22.092
It would take a shotgun to
bring my animal down, right, D?

01:00:22.462 --> 01:00:24.698
Three to one!
All he does is win!

01:00:24.698 --> 01:00:26.300
He's got a big fight.

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:29.304
I already stitched his eye, but
you're gonna have to keep him awake ...

01:00:29.304 --> 01:00:32.068
at least for the next eight hours
because of the risk of concussion.

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:35.277
Keep him awake? I can do that.
I am a champ of it.

01:00:35.277 --> 01:00:36.403
How did I do?

01:00:40.116 --> 01:00:41.674
You did what you do.

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.488
That's why I chose to train you.

01:00:51.562 --> 01:00:53.292
You did good, kid.

01:00:58.738 --> 01:01:00.706
Hey! You're falling asleep ?

01:01:01.574 --> 01:01:02.809
You're awake?

01:01:02.809 --> 01:01:04.334
You know what we should've done ?

01:01:05.946 --> 01:01:08.210
We should've invited that dirty Russian.

01:01:09.049 --> 01:01:10.984
Tina ! Come here !

01:01:11.119 --> 01:01:12.882
- Hello, guys.
- Give me a hug.

01:01:15.690 --> 01:01:18.694
This is the champ' right here.
This is the champ'.

01:01:18.694 --> 01:01:21.597
Hey. We need to keep him up
four hours.

01:01:21.597 --> 01:01:22.690
Ok

01:01:23.433 --> 01:01:25.128
Keep him up, come on!

01:01:25.235 --> 01:01:28.033
- D, get up and dance with her!
- Come here, champ'.

01:01:28.305 --> 01:01:29.466
Another drink.

01:02:14.125 --> 01:02:16.093
Wow, man.

01:02:19.698 --> 01:02:21.100
What do you think are you doing?

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:23.159
- Gimme the keys.
- Are you even awake ?

01:02:23.302 --> 01:02:24.971
Stop messling around and give me the keys.

01:02:24.971 --> 01:02:28.566
- You can't even open your eyes.
- Yes, get in the car, drunko.

01:02:30.344 --> 01:02:31.333
Come here !

01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:35.281
You're really becoming to be
a pain in my ass !

01:02:40.088 --> 01:02:43.193
Two hundred thousand dollars !
That's what I'm due !

01:02:43.193 --> 01:02:44.592
What are you talking about?

01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:46.392
Shut up!

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:50.566
You were supposed to lose that fight!

01:02:50.634 --> 01:02:53.068
But L.A. Jim, he dropped the ball.

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:56.475
So I had to eliminate him.
'Cause he was unreliable.

01:02:56.475 --> 01:02:58.410
I can't have unreliable.

01:02:58.410 --> 01:03:02.040
So now, I'm here to appeal
directly to the source.

01:03:02.348 --> 01:03:06.114
You boys owe me
two hundred thousand dollars.

01:03:06.486 --> 01:03:09.979
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
I've got 10 thousand.

01:03:11.325 --> 01:03:13.351
You think I don't know everything?

01:03:15.396 --> 01:03:18.263
You've got 24. Which is mine.

01:03:18.566 --> 01:03:21.337
Which means you still
owe me 176 000.

01:03:21.337 --> 01:03:23.168
I owe you shit!

01:03:25.342 --> 01:03:26.400
Come here.

01:03:28.011 --> 01:03:29.342
Open your mouth.

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.709
Open it.

01:03:33.351 --> 01:03:34.443
Think.

01:03:36.087 --> 01:03:37.646
So we're clear ...

01:03:38.123 --> 01:03:40.148
You're taking the Titan to fight ...

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:43.262
... and you're gonna lose.

01:03:43.262 --> 01:03:45.060
In the second.

01:03:46.032 --> 01:03:47.226
Say it.

01:03:49.335 --> 01:03:50.704
Say it!

01:03:50.704 --> 01:03:53.434
Yes! Yes, I'm gonna lose!

01:03:57.512 --> 01:03:59.104
good to hear.

01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:09.382
I am owed.

01:04:31.585 --> 01:04:32.553
You'll be fine.

01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:48.335
She'll be allright.

01:04:49.272 --> 01:04:52.674
I'm gonna need
some more hot water ... and towels.

01:04:54.378 --> 01:04:55.743
Take it easy, kid.

01:04:58.516 --> 01:04:59.710
Come here.

01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:05.480
Take her with you.

01:05:33.256 --> 01:05:35.191
I'm gonna make this right.

01:05:55.315 --> 01:05:56.942
You're a fucking monster.

01:05:57.451 --> 01:05:58.419
Let him out.

01:06:01.356 --> 01:06:02.516
Guards!

01:06:30.123 --> 01:06:32.023
If it wasn't for your brother ...

01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:34.722
I would be dead.

01:06:37.565 --> 01:06:39.692
Every week they
came at me.

01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:44.304
I became a monster.

01:06:47.209 --> 01:06:49.201
Now that's that all I have left.

01:06:51.748 --> 01:06:53.614
It's all that I can feel.

01:06:59.456 --> 01:07:01.288
You're not a monster.

01:07:02.994 --> 01:07:05.987
I can feel the good in you.
Even if you can't.

01:07:09.235 --> 01:07:11.328
And if I can' do this?

01:07:14.241 --> 01:07:15.731
We can.

01:07:22.655 --> 01:07:24.558
I check the county morgue,
I find his name?

01:07:24.558 --> 01:07:25.559
Yes.

01:07:25.559 --> 01:07:27.427
- What was it?
- Jim Jacoby.

01:07:27.427 --> 01:07:29.224
Also known as L.A. Jim .

01:07:29.396 --> 01:07:31.332
- And the cops ?
- Marks.

01:07:31.332 --> 01:07:32.629
Ray Marks?

01:07:33.134 --> 01:07:34.965
You know, he called me in the morning.

01:07:36.137 --> 01:07:38.107
He said he was investigating
a murder.

01:07:38.107 --> 01:07:40.337
Committed by a drug dealer
named Ace Reed.

01:07:41.377 --> 01:07:43.814
He asked me to keep an eye on you,
see if you seemed jumpy.

01:07:43.814 --> 01:07:45.645
Maybe like you would be leaving town.

01:07:51.489 --> 01:07:53.291
I'm telling you the truth.

01:07:53.291 --> 01:07:55.760
And if he frames Ace,
it will be with this gun.

01:07:57.262 --> 01:07:58.397
I need your help.

01:07:58.397 --> 01:08:00.632
Shell casing on a cop
is not gonna be enough.

01:08:00.632 --> 01:08:01.793
I'll give more.

01:08:02.268 --> 01:08:03.997
Let's say this is all true.

01:08:05.071 --> 01:08:06.333
Why don't you run?

01:08:07.308 --> 01:08:09.640
You know how many assholes
jump their parole every month?

01:08:10.077 --> 01:08:13.241
Maybe you run, maybe I'm
too tired to find you.

01:08:14.282 --> 01:08:16.182
-I can't leave.
- Why not?

01:08:17.652 --> 01:08:19.313
I can't leave her.

01:08:22.191 --> 01:08:23.680
I can't leave her.

01:08:27.029 --> 01:08:29.122
I'm 3 to 1 in Biloxi.

01:08:29.198 --> 01:08:31.691
- If you put 300 000 on me ...
- 300 grand ?

01:08:32.770 --> 01:08:34.670
You did your run already.

01:08:35.038 --> 01:08:37.975
Besides, my money's safe
away in the bank.

01:08:38.544 --> 01:08:40.779
Why do I need another shot
on a horse...

01:08:40.779 --> 01:08:43.111
-  ... that probably can't even win?
- For the same reason I do.

01:08:43.282 --> 01:08:44.648
To get out.

01:08:46.118 --> 01:08:48.349
Marks, he's gonna pin L.A. Jim on you.

01:08:54.295 --> 01:08:55.626
Is that right ?

01:08:58.133 --> 01:08:59.801
So how are we gonna skin this cat ?

01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:01.703
300 000 on me to win ...

01:09:01.703 --> 01:09:03.729
and I want two of your guys ...

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:06.241
and you must stay away from the fight.

01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:09.075
You must win the fight.

01:09:16.688 --> 01:09:19.020
You'll need more than
a shell casing.

01:09:19.224 --> 01:09:23.321
Yes, but tell me in the I.A
doesn't have a phonebook these guys.

01:09:49.492 --> 01:09:51.118
Can not hide forever.

01:09:57.201 --> 01:09:59.304
I want these photos on
the web site tonight ...

01:09:59.304 --> 01:10:02.603
And get them to Allan in L.A.
for the local TV press conference.

01:10:37.515 --> 01:10:39.574
32, 33 ...

01:10:40.151 --> 01:10:44.612
34, 35, 36, 37 ...

01:10:46.325 --> 01:10:47.725
He is still circling...

01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:50.630
Right there, see how he puts
his head down when he shoots ?

01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:52.325
Watch this, watch this.

01:10:53.868 --> 01:10:55.335
Boom! Right there.

01:11:10.787 --> 01:11:15.192
Ladies and gentlemen, our judge
has called a stop to the action ...

01:11:15.192 --> 01:11:19.431
in 2 minutes and 47 seconds
in the very final round ...

01:11:19.431 --> 01:11:21.199
declaring its winner ...

01:11:21.199 --> 01:11:28.572
Johnny Rattlehouse Toothless!

01:11:29.375 --> 01:11:31.845
So, tell us about your new golden
boy, Dillon McGwire.

01:11:31.845 --> 01:11:35.215
This really fight of a lifetime
for Dillon McGwire.

01:11:35.215 --> 01:11:39.550
He was in need of a second chance and
Crush decided to give it to him.

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:41.085
One minute!

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:51.292
Right.

01:11:51.734 --> 01:11:55.139
Remember, stay low,
try to work your way on the inside.

01:11:55.139 --> 01:11:57.541
He will want some big shots.
Watch him ...

01:11:57.541 --> 01:11:59.532
get ready to move. Right?

01:12:03.281 --> 01:12:06.479
Whatever happens, make
sure she gets out.

01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:08.687
On the count of three!

01:12:08.788 --> 01:12:10.423
Let's make some noise!

01:12:10.423 --> 01:12:13.484
One, two, three!

01:12:15.896 --> 01:12:17.557
What the champions never do?

01:12:18.298 --> 01:12:19.357
Quit.

01:12:37.688 --> 01:12:40.191
He was a wrestling specialist...

01:12:40.191 --> 01:12:42.560
weighing one ninety ripple-y ...

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:45.325
good muscle-y pounds ...

01:12:45.831 --> 01:12:47.355
Wait, friends.

01:12:48.333 --> 01:12:49.494
Wait for it.

01:12:51.804 --> 01:12:54.329
I see you at the end
of the second round.

01:12:55.141 --> 01:12:58.312
Ladies and gentlemen, a
round of applause ...

01:12:58.312 --> 01:13:02.374
Dillon McGwire!

01:13:06.721 --> 01:13:10.560
And here comes Dillon McGwire, the All American
that was once considered ...

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.828
one of the best amateur
wrestlers in the world.

01:13:12.828 --> 01:13:15.199
This guy's a huge
underdog tonight ...

01:13:15.199 --> 01:13:17.367
but he doesn't seem
to recognize that.

01:13:17.367 --> 01:13:20.633
Look at the glare in his eyes.
This guy is totally dawdling.

01:13:29.682 --> 01:13:33.687
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
introducing his opponent ...

01:13:33.687 --> 01:13:36.383
seeking to maintain its title.

01:13:40.795 --> 01:13:43.286
Weighing tonight one hundred...

01:13:43.397 --> 01:13:47.095
and 88 pounds ...

01:13:47.536 --> 01:13:49.800
The Bayou Bomber ...

01:13:50.172 --> 01:13:54.473
Titan Powell!

01:14:05.657 --> 01:14:09.262
You know what, this guy scares the hell
out of me every time I see him.

01:14:09.262 --> 01:14:11.764
You talk with him outside the ring
and he's the nicest guy possible.

01:14:11.764 --> 01:14:15.369
But when he gets inside this cage,
he's a complete monster.

01:14:15.369 --> 01:14:17.638
Hey, do not worry about it,
it's all show.

01:14:17.638 --> 01:14:19.373
Despite the reputation of Titan ...

01:14:19.373 --> 01:14:22.172
I think we will see a very
evenly balanced fight tonight.

01:14:22.343 --> 01:14:25.346
Neither of these guys
is the kind to give an inch.

01:14:25.346 --> 01:14:27.583
And both of the guys are coming in
undefeated tonight.

01:14:27.583 --> 01:14:30.450
But I just don't think Dillon
McGwire has ever dealt ...

01:14:30.586 --> 01:14:34.580
with the type of power that
Titan's gonna bring with his punches tonight.

01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:39.790
FEEL MY PAIN

01:14:45.603 --> 01:14:47.406
Okay, gentlemen.
three three minutes rounds.

01:14:47.406 --> 01:14:49.908
Keep it clean. somebody taps,
they're gone.

01:14:49.908 --> 01:14:51.877
Disengage, and go to your corners.

01:14:51.877 --> 01:14:54.113
When the bell rings,
come out ready to fight.

01:14:54.113 --> 01:14:55.239
Touch gloves.

01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:58.648
First round.

01:15:01.288 --> 01:15:02.255
Chump.

01:15:08.663 --> 01:15:10.028
Fighters ready!

01:15:10.299 --> 01:15:11.425
Ready?

01:15:11.701 --> 01:15:12.690
Fight!

01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:00.758
Powell is going up for the guillotine
early here.

01:16:00.758 --> 01:16:02.817
Dillon McGwire may
be in trouble.

01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:16.609
Titan Powell is completely
manhandling it.

01:16:16.609 --> 01:16:17.804
Get off!

01:16:34.196 --> 01:16:35.527
Let it go.

01:16:40.637 --> 01:16:42.538
Spilt, spilt.

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:49.606
Ready?

01:16:50.415 --> 01:16:51.507
Fight!

01:17:08.303 --> 01:17:09.634
Get out, D!

01:17:33.799 --> 01:17:35.164
Here, here, here.

01:17:36.635 --> 01:17:38.297
Hey. Hey.

01:17:38.771 --> 01:17:40.500
Here are two twenties.

01:17:40.874 --> 01:17:44.641
You can take that to that
guy over there? Thank you.

01:17:48.349 --> 01:17:49.611
It's allright. he's good.

01:17:49.784 --> 01:17:50.819
Take.

01:17:50.819 --> 01:17:53.481
Hey! Keep your hands up,
he's fast!

01:18:01.731 --> 01:18:03.700
This is a beauty pageant for them.

01:18:04.668 --> 01:18:07.638
Sure, if he goes to the floor again
he's gonna want to throw in a guillotine.

01:18:07.638 --> 01:18:10.107
Open him up.
Make him fucking pay.

01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:13.502
Get at him !

01:18:27.795 --> 01:18:28.819
Ready?

01:18:29.597 --> 01:18:30.655
Fight!

01:18:30.831 --> 01:18:33.096
I'm gonna break you, fish.

01:18:33.201 --> 01:18:34.225
Come !

01:18:58.397 --> 01:19:00.331
A spectacular move !

01:19:02.768 --> 01:19:05.397
Powell is seeking the
guillotine again.

01:19:10.378 --> 01:19:11.743
D, get out !

01:19:13.381 --> 01:19:14.871
don't take this.

01:20:06.610 --> 01:20:08.271
Powell is rocked!

01:20:35.944 --> 01:20:40.677
A punch in the eye, maybe two,
before it closes completely.

01:20:40.882 --> 01:20:43.019
If the eye closes more,
I stop this fight.

01:20:43.019 --> 01:20:46.511
Why not stop earlier this round?
Look at Powell, he can barely stand...

01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:07.638
Ready?

01:21:08.415 --> 01:21:09.507
Fight!

01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:38.717
Dillon McGwire
took Powell in a neck key.

01:21:38.717 --> 01:21:40.184
This may be the end.

01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:56.703
Good job, D!

01:22:13.991 --> 01:22:15.458
great gig.

01:22:15.726 --> 01:22:17.785
Thanks. Great fight.

01:22:19.597 --> 01:22:23.193
Ladies and gentlemen, we
have just witnessed history.

01:22:25.537 --> 01:22:28.530
The giant has fallen tonight ...

01:22:36.617 --> 01:22:38.245
McGwire!

01:22:40.322 --> 01:22:41.346
Go.

01:22:56.006 --> 01:22:57.804
We have the suspect ...

01:22:58.309 --> 01:23:00.573
- Hey, man.
- Hey!

01:23:02.648 --> 01:23:03.582
Come on, asshole.

01:23:03.582 --> 01:23:05.184
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:23:05.184 --> 01:23:06.352
I know my rights.

01:23:06.352 --> 01:23:08.685
Anything you say or do can be
used against you and ...

01:23:10.223 --> 01:23:12.559
McGwire I'll kill you! You hear me?!

01:23:12.559 --> 01:23:14.829
Take all of Titan Powell's
off the website.

01:23:14.829 --> 01:23:16.631
I wanna bring McGwire front
and center.

01:23:16.631 --> 01:23:20.167
Get on the phone with New York, let them know
we just had the fight of the century ...

01:23:20.167 --> 01:23:22.871
broadcast to millions of homes and
that this train is leaving the station ...

01:23:22.871 --> 01:23:23.929
with or without them.

01:23:24.373 --> 01:23:27.775
Dillon, that was amazing.
I'm talking six figures.

01:23:30.513 --> 01:23:32.481
What is going on ? Where is he ?

01:23:32.782 --> 01:23:34.718
- Who?
- Seriously, Jake ...

01:23:34.718 --> 01:23:38.322
I need to put an interview on the
website before Tokyo wakes up.

01:23:38.322 --> 01:23:39.722
Yeah... I don't think
he's gonna make it.

01:23:40.358 --> 01:23:41.893
He just fought the fight
of his life ...

01:23:41.893 --> 01:23:43.292
We need to cash in.

01:23:44.663 --> 01:23:45.892
We did.

01:24:06.255 --> 01:24:07.415
Mr. Delano.

01:24:12.662 --> 01:24:14.391
All debts paid.

01:24:17.902 --> 01:24:19.392
Oh, Jakey.

01:24:19.837 --> 01:24:21.600
I knew that'd work out.

01:24:22.273 --> 01:24:23.536
Gentlemen.

01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:35.783
I don't wanna know.

01:24:36.323 --> 01:24:38.791
- Mail for you, Ryan.
- Thanks.

01:24:47.670 --> 01:24:49.695
GONE FISHING.
PRESS THE BUTTON.

But the sun's shining boos And

I'm with her.

01:26:20.444 --> 01:26:24.278

And waited all this time to
get to the heat of the Sun

01:27:16.309 --> 01:27:21.916
Now there's nothing to hide
we understand ourselves

01:27:21.916 --> 01:27:27.787
But when the sun sets today
