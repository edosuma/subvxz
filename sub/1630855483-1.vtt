00:17.790 --> 00:22.795
* What happened to my world

00:23.996 --> 00:28.601
* Where did all
the beautiful go *

00:29.535 --> 00:34.540
* Why does life have to hurt

00:35.474 --> 00:40.279
* And do I really wanna know

00:41.214 --> 00:46.185
* What happened to my world

00:47.120 --> 00:52.091
* What happened to the time

00:53.359 --> 00:57.563
* Did every moment
just slip away *

00:58.597 --> 01:03.502
* I thought happiness was mine

01:04.703 --> 01:09.175
* I guess that's
just an old cliche *

01:10.075 --> 01:13.712
* What happened to the time

01:31.564 --> 01:33.031
- Is that the guy?

01:33.031 --> 01:35.668
- Does he look like a plastic
surgeon to you, dipstick?

01:35.668 --> 01:37.236
This is candy ass.

01:37.236 --> 01:39.138
- Yeah, we don't even have
any hard evidence yet.

01:39.138 --> 01:40.005
No, this.

01:40.005 --> 01:40.906
Us.

01:40.906 --> 01:42.641
Doing a stakeout?

01:42.641 --> 01:44.843
Like we don't know
we're being sidelined.

01:44.843 --> 01:46.345
- You know what, don't blame me.

01:46.345 --> 01:47.646
You're the one who
flapped your cocksuck

01:47.646 --> 01:49.315
at Captain
Brick-Up-His-Ass, okay?

01:49.315 --> 01:51.717
- Okay, his wife had two legs

01:51.717 --> 01:54.019
and then shows up to
a cookout with one.

01:55.588 --> 01:56.955
Am I not supposed to comment?

01:56.955 --> 01:58.457
- Generally speaking, no.

01:58.457 --> 02:00.125
You know you're not.

02:17.376 --> 02:18.411
- Jesus.

02:18.411 --> 02:19.512
- Do you have my numbers?

02:19.512 --> 02:20.913
- Can't it wait till I finish?

02:20.913 --> 02:22.348
- The fuck is taking so long?

02:22.348 --> 02:23.849
- Dr. Shifflett.

02:23.849 --> 02:28.421
It takes time to set up the
accounts in a way that's-

02:28.421 --> 02:29.688
- That's, that's, that.

02:29.688 --> 02:30.889
- That's what?

02:30.889 --> 02:31.724
I can't.

02:31.724 --> 02:32.891
- That makes sense.

02:32.891 --> 02:34.293
What I do is art and-
- Jesus Christ.

02:34.293 --> 02:35.761
- Forgive me for wanting to-

02:35.761 --> 02:38.997
- Just sit your ass at the
desk and get it the fuck done.

02:38.997 --> 02:40.132
Okay?

02:40.132 --> 02:42.034
Don't fuck with me today, Andy.

02:42.034 --> 02:43.736
We've got Marin
Wallace coming in.

02:45.471 --> 02:46.672
- Oh, it's today?

02:46.672 --> 02:47.640
- I know you've got
a thing for her.

02:47.640 --> 02:49.842
Don't fucking play coy with me.

02:49.842 --> 02:51.076
- I have a thing.

02:51.076 --> 02:52.311
She's just really
pretty and nice to me.

02:52.311 --> 02:55.180
- Dude,
no one gives a shit.

02:55.180 --> 02:56.982
Just do me a favor and don't
slobber all over yourself

02:56.982 --> 02:58.351
when she gets here.

02:58.351 --> 02:59.151
- All right.

03:03.289 --> 03:04.089
Can you...

03:06.325 --> 03:07.993
I can't finish if
you're in here.

03:19.305 --> 03:22.575
- You're so fucking
embarrassing, Andy.

03:26.979 --> 03:28.514
And wash your fucking hands.

03:28.514 --> 03:30.349
- Wash your fucking hands.

03:36.889 --> 03:39.692
- You gonna
sit your asses there

03:39.692 --> 03:42.761
and watch Dr.
Shifflett's office.

03:42.761 --> 03:45.764
- Yeah, I said we're here!

03:45.764 --> 03:46.699
Fuck!

03:46.699 --> 03:47.900
- Now, don't you get

03:47.900 --> 03:49.735
a smartass mouth with
me, motherfucker!

03:49.735 --> 03:51.270
- We're not, Cindy.

03:51.270 --> 03:53.839
We got everyone's profiles
and we'll keep you posted.

03:53.839 --> 03:56.241
- That is
all, detective.

03:56.241 --> 03:57.776
- Fucking assbelch.

03:57.776 --> 03:59.345
Jesus.

03:59.345 --> 04:01.414
- You know, 15 years ago, we
just would've gone up there,

04:01.414 --> 04:03.582
busted down the goddamn
door, guns blazing.

04:03.582 --> 04:06.018
Would've had this whole shit
wrapped up in five minutes.

04:06.018 --> 04:07.486
- It's total bullshit.

04:07.486 --> 04:08.321
- Honestly.

04:09.488 --> 04:10.323
- Oh, wait.

04:10.323 --> 04:11.156
Speaking of bullshit.

04:17.229 --> 04:19.231
Would you look at
this prick right here?

04:20.466 --> 04:21.867
Where's his ski lift?

04:21.867 --> 04:23.402
Frosty the snowballs.

04:25.137 --> 04:26.271
What a fucking jackoff.

04:27.306 --> 04:28.774
- I was hoping.

04:28.774 --> 04:30.309
- That Shif would only
higher bald pieces of shit

04:30.309 --> 04:31.109
to work here?

04:31.109 --> 04:32.345
Oh, what?

04:32.345 --> 04:33.546
Jesus Christ, right?

04:33.546 --> 04:35.714
He looks like a
sandwich spokesman.

04:35.714 --> 04:37.182
Goddamn.

04:37.182 --> 04:38.216
- Who is he?

04:38.216 --> 04:39.251
- Oh, okay.

04:39.251 --> 04:40.486
Yeah. Well, let's see.

04:40.486 --> 04:43.656
Fatty number two
is Gene, no name.

04:43.656 --> 04:44.590
Weird.

04:44.590 --> 04:45.924
Ex-CIA.
- CIA?

04:47.059 --> 04:50.363
- Was canned for
extreme anger issues

04:50.363 --> 04:52.064
and delusions of grandeur.

04:52.064 --> 04:53.432
Sounds like my wife.

04:53.432 --> 04:54.967
Recently divorced, no kids.

04:54.967 --> 04:56.902
He seems to be a total loser.

04:56.902 --> 05:00.739
And my guess is he's probably
the muscle of this operation.

05:00.739 --> 05:01.940
- Muscle.

05:01.940 --> 05:03.776
Looks like a bloated
shitstain to me.

05:03.776 --> 05:05.378
- Goddamn, I hope
he was breathing

05:05.378 --> 05:06.745
as he went up those stairs.

05:06.745 --> 05:08.947
He's such a fat piece of shit.

05:08.947 --> 05:10.883
- Oh, you've been working out?

05:10.883 --> 05:12.084
Yeah, I didn't think so.

05:48.687 --> 05:51.990
- So you figure out tonight?

05:51.990 --> 05:53.091
- No, I can't.

05:53.091 --> 05:54.126
I have my daughter.

05:54.126 --> 05:54.960
- Hey.

05:56.429 --> 05:57.329
I'm not asking.

05:58.497 --> 06:00.933
- Oh, does doctor
need a spanking?

06:00.933 --> 06:03.402
- Oh, I think you know
exactly what doctor wants.

06:04.503 --> 06:06.204
Yo, money man.

06:06.204 --> 06:07.272
- Fuck.

06:07.272 --> 06:08.306
- You done yet?

06:08.306 --> 06:09.241
- You know I'm not.

06:12.845 --> 06:14.312
- What you drinking there?

06:14.312 --> 06:15.280
Fucking gravy?

06:26.324 --> 06:27.159
Fix your hair.

06:32.531 --> 06:34.633
- Fuck this fucking deadline!

06:34.633 --> 06:35.868
Jesus!

06:35.868 --> 06:38.504
- Seems mad like Ikea's
having an online sale,

06:38.504 --> 06:41.440
but the shop floor's
not matching what
the online sale says.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.408
- No wonder he
didn't have any hair.

06:44.943 --> 06:46.411
- Fucking trying
to ruin my life.

06:46.411 --> 06:48.481
I need more time
to do this shit.

06:48.481 --> 06:49.715
Goddammit.

06:49.715 --> 06:50.816
- If he jumps, you're
doing the paperwork.

06:50.816 --> 06:53.118
His ass is gonna splat.

06:53.118 --> 06:54.019
- I
mean, I guess the cleanup

06:54.019 --> 06:55.287
would be like a hose.

06:55.287 --> 06:57.222
I mean, how do you clean
pudding off of pavement?

06:57.222 --> 06:59.858
- A hose, a fire hose,
that's a lot of splat.

06:59.858 --> 07:00.859
- You fucking drinking gravy?

07:00.859 --> 07:02.828
Shut your mouth,
you Aussie fuck.

07:02.828 --> 07:04.096
I'm drinking goddamn coffee.

07:04.096 --> 07:05.631
You know it's fucking coffee.

07:05.631 --> 07:06.865
Don't say that in front of
the goddamn receptionist.

07:06.865 --> 07:08.066
Just make me look
a fucking idiot.

07:08.066 --> 07:10.102
- What if I took a
shot at him right now?

07:11.236 --> 07:12.070
Just in the leg?

07:13.105 --> 07:14.272
He wouldn't even feel it.

07:14.272 --> 07:16.208
- I mean, does
butter feel anything?

07:20.278 --> 07:23.215
- Well, let's
change some lives, shall we?

07:47.372 --> 07:48.206
- I need more time.

07:48.206 --> 07:49.041
- Gene.

07:53.712 --> 07:57.082
Gene here, he's going to
babysit you until you're done.

07:58.884 --> 08:01.153
He's more capable than he looks.

08:01.153 --> 08:01.954
Today.

08:22.608 --> 08:26.178
- You should probably
go to work now, Andy.

08:56.241 --> 08:58.476
- All right, let's do this.

09:00.012 --> 09:00.813
Okay.

09:06.018 --> 09:08.120
Let's get this day over with.

09:13.525 --> 09:14.760
- I'm sorry,
I just have to say,

09:14.760 --> 09:16.461
I'm a huge fan of
your short stories.

09:16.461 --> 09:18.563
- There's certainly promise.

09:18.563 --> 09:19.497
- Thank you.

09:19.497 --> 09:20.432
- And we're so excited

09:20.432 --> 09:21.667
to have you at Miller and Kale.

09:21.667 --> 09:23.368
We're so excited to
publish your book.

09:23.368 --> 09:25.938
I mean, I cried when
I read "Choices".

09:25.938 --> 09:29.107
- Yes, it moved me.

09:29.107 --> 09:30.776
- The
outline, may we see?

09:30.776 --> 09:32.377
- I bet she's already
into chapters.

09:32.377 --> 09:33.211
How many chapters?

09:33.211 --> 09:34.146
Three?

09:34.146 --> 09:35.180
- Maybe.

09:35.180 --> 09:36.882
- Maybe?
- Maybe, what's maybe?

09:36.882 --> 09:38.016
- I don't know.

09:38.016 --> 09:39.685
- You don't know?

09:39.685 --> 09:41.787
- My idea

09:41.787 --> 09:42.988
that I have

09:43.956 --> 09:46.792
will be ready soon.

09:46.792 --> 09:48.093
- She's scared.
- She's not scared.

09:48.093 --> 09:49.161
- Excuse me!
- I'm sorry!

09:49.161 --> 09:50.763
- Ladies, ladies, let her speak.

09:57.335 --> 09:58.737
- I'm a goddamn
deer in headlights.

09:58.737 --> 10:01.840
- I need a manuscript
in three weeks

10:01.840 --> 10:03.909
or I will murder
everyone in this room.

10:07.379 --> 10:08.647
- They hate me.

10:08.647 --> 10:10.816
I was supposed to have
a draft to them today,

10:10.816 --> 10:13.218
and I have nothing,
absolutely nothing.

10:13.218 --> 10:16.588
You know, I spent my whole
life on that first one

10:16.588 --> 10:19.024
and it's just the
collection of short stories.

10:19.024 --> 10:20.258
I'm not a novel writer.

10:20.258 --> 10:21.393
I don't know what the
hell I was thinking.

10:21.393 --> 10:22.661
Why did I agree to this?

10:22.661 --> 10:23.996
- I'm sure
it's not that bad.

10:23.996 --> 10:26.198
Writers blow past their
deadlines all the time.

10:26.198 --> 10:28.133
- They already
paid me in advance.

10:28.133 --> 10:30.302
I feel like I'm just
stealing from them.

10:30.302 --> 10:31.603
I still have to deal with dad

10:31.603 --> 10:33.839
and I still have to deal
with his ashes and his-

10:33.839 --> 10:36.909
- The short stories you
wrote, your first book,

10:36.909 --> 10:38.576
how did you come
up with them again?

10:38.576 --> 10:39.544
- I don't, I don't know.

10:39.544 --> 10:40.512
I-

10:40.512 --> 10:42.014
- Fuck you, you don't know.

10:42.014 --> 10:43.949
- You know, some of them
just came to me in a dream

10:43.949 --> 10:45.550
or they were just there.

10:45.550 --> 10:46.518
- That's right.

10:46.518 --> 10:48.020
They came to you in a dream.

10:48.020 --> 10:49.654
That means you're a great
fucking writer, bitch.

10:49.654 --> 10:50.723
Deal with it.

10:50.723 --> 10:52.224
I mean, look at dad.

10:52.224 --> 10:55.327
He spent his whole life
trying to save sea turtles.

10:55.327 --> 10:57.662
Fucking sea turtles!

10:57.662 --> 11:00.298
Why can't you apply some of
that passion to your work?

12:10.268 --> 12:11.103
- Okay.

14:05.984 --> 14:07.085
- Really?

14:07.085 --> 14:08.753
And who told you that?

14:08.753 --> 14:10.188
- My fiance.

14:10.188 --> 14:11.123
- Right.

14:11.123 --> 14:12.157
And he said they're perfect?

14:12.157 --> 14:12.991
- Yes.

14:15.460 --> 14:17.095
Well, he said he was happy.

14:17.095 --> 14:18.630
- Ah, happy.

14:19.797 --> 14:20.598
Right.

14:42.720 --> 14:46.391
If he's happy, then I
guess we're done here.

15:39.344 --> 15:40.178
36.

15:41.213 --> 15:42.047
24.

15:43.848 --> 15:44.682
36.

15:51.256 --> 15:54.459
- What would you have in mind?

15:54.459 --> 15:57.895
- Well, I have a
couple of ideas.

16:05.803 --> 16:07.605
How old did you
say we were again?

16:07.605 --> 16:08.840
- 24.

16:08.840 --> 16:10.142
- Oh.

16:10.142 --> 16:12.477
I'm going to be brutally
honest with you, okay?

16:16.081 --> 16:17.882
You're a six at best.

16:17.882 --> 16:22.887
My job is to take you
from that six up to a ten.

16:24.056 --> 16:25.257
Right now, you're
hookup material,

16:25.257 --> 16:27.525
but you're not
marriage material.

16:43.041 --> 16:47.445
What I suggest is that
you let me do my job.

16:47.445 --> 16:51.649
I'm gonna take all of this
and I'm gonna throw it away.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.286
I'm gonna fix it.

16:54.286 --> 16:57.189
And then maybe if you're lucky,

16:57.189 --> 16:58.423
you'll get to walk
down the aisle

16:58.423 --> 17:00.692
like daddy's little princess.

17:00.692 --> 17:01.493
Okay?

17:02.394 --> 17:03.228
Okay.

17:04.596 --> 17:06.864
Why don't you grab your clothes
and we'll get outta here.

17:06.864 --> 17:07.699
- Okay.

17:33.024 --> 17:33.858
- Hey.

17:35.093 --> 17:36.694
Super proud of your progress.

17:36.694 --> 17:38.029
There's nothing to be afraid of.

17:38.029 --> 17:39.431
You're gonna look
10 times better.

17:39.431 --> 17:40.898
Have a great day, sweetheart.

18:07.525 --> 18:08.360
Is he done yet?

18:08.360 --> 18:09.194
- Who?

18:31.183 --> 18:32.284
- What's going on?

18:40.292 --> 18:41.125
Peter?

18:56.408 --> 18:58.643
- He took my fucking money.

19:02.013 --> 19:03.147
- Marin Wallace!

19:03.147 --> 19:04.382
Marin Wallace!

19:04.382 --> 19:05.617
Marin Wallace, roll
it down, roll it down.

19:05.617 --> 19:06.551
Yeah, roll it down.

19:06.551 --> 19:07.785
All the way down, keep coming.

19:07.785 --> 19:10.054
Peter Shifflett
is a fraud, okay?

19:10.054 --> 19:12.257
He convinces women to
get plastic surgery,

19:12.257 --> 19:14.959
even though they absolutely
don't need it, okay?

19:14.959 --> 19:16.628
I mean, look at you,
Marin, you're beautiful.

19:16.628 --> 19:17.829
You don't need that shit.

19:17.829 --> 19:19.397
Do not get plastic
surgery from that guy,

19:19.397 --> 19:21.499
'cause you're better
than that, all right?

19:23.868 --> 19:25.403
Okay, I'm just, I'm
gonna give you my car.

19:25.403 --> 19:27.004
That's what I'm gonna do,
I'm gonna give you my car.

19:27.004 --> 19:29.140
Put it on Craigslist's,
sell it for $500.

19:29.140 --> 19:31.042
Buy yourself something
nice just for you.

19:31.042 --> 19:32.610
Fuck everybody else.

19:32.610 --> 19:33.445
I love you.

19:36.147 --> 19:37.315
Wait for me, Marin!

19:37.315 --> 19:40.285
* I've been traveling
down the road *

19:40.285 --> 19:42.920
* Looking for a
place called home *

19:42.920 --> 19:45.490
* But sometimes I don't know

19:45.490 --> 19:48.159
* Where I belong

19:48.159 --> 19:51.162
* I've been twisting
in my sleep *

19:51.162 --> 19:53.831
* Looking for a better dream

19:53.831 --> 19:56.468
* But they're all escaping me

19:56.468 --> 20:00.672
* That's the way
it goes sometimes *

20:00.672 --> 20:05.677
* So I keep on moving
the best I can *

20:06.844 --> 20:11.416
* Rolling with devil,
holdin' angel's hands *

20:12.183 --> 20:14.486
* Sometimes I'm lonely

20:14.486 --> 20:18.189
* But mostly I'm
glad to be alive *

20:20.258 --> 20:22.226
* That's why

20:22.226 --> 20:27.064
* I run

20:27.064 --> 20:29.701
* Every highway goes somewhere

20:29.701 --> 20:32.470
* That the locals
all come there *

20:32.470 --> 20:35.139
* I'm gonna find
my own, I swear *

20:35.139 --> 20:39.644
* I'm gonna settle down

20:39.644 --> 20:44.616
* I keep on moving
the best I can *

20:45.817 --> 20:50.087
* Rolling with devil,
holdin' angel's hands *

20:50.888 --> 20:53.224
* Sometimes I'm lonely

20:53.224 --> 20:58.195
* But mostly I'm
glad to be alive *

20:58.863 --> 21:00.932
* That's why

21:00.932 --> 21:03.000
* I run

21:04.502 --> 21:06.604
- Yeah, Bob
Taylor, please.

21:06.604 --> 21:07.439
Hey, BT.

21:07.439 --> 21:08.272
What's going on, man?

21:08.272 --> 21:09.741
It's Andy Fielder.

21:09.741 --> 21:12.009
Hey, listen, I need a big
motherfucking favor from you.

21:12.009 --> 21:12.844
Can I come see you?

21:12.844 --> 21:14.011
Where are you?

21:14.011 --> 21:14.846
Venice?

21:17.181 --> 21:18.015
Venice.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.517
Venice, Venice, Venice.

21:19.517 --> 21:20.785
Yeah, fuck it, I
can make that work.

21:20.785 --> 21:21.653
Coming right now.

21:23.488 --> 21:28.493
* Making deals with the
devil, holding angel's hands *

21:29.260 --> 21:31.729
* Sometimes I'm lonely

21:31.729 --> 21:36.734
* But mostly I'm
glad to be alive *

21:37.369 --> 21:39.971
* That's why

21:39.971 --> 21:42.507
* That's why

21:42.507 --> 21:44.542
* I run

21:46.344 --> 21:48.780
- The last number
dialed on Andy's phone

21:48.780 --> 21:50.982
was for a woman in Los Angeles.

21:50.982 --> 21:52.750
- So what are you telling me?

21:52.750 --> 21:53.618
Is that where he went?

21:53.618 --> 21:54.652
- Probably.

21:54.652 --> 21:55.787
That's where I would go.

21:55.787 --> 21:56.788
The weather's great.

21:56.788 --> 21:58.289
I hear it's really dry there.

21:58.289 --> 21:59.924
- Okay,
just get her address

21:59.924 --> 22:01.158
and call the idiot.

22:01.158 --> 22:03.928
- Okay, so
then I'll just-

22:03.928 --> 22:05.397
Mother Murphy!

22:05.397 --> 22:06.931
- What the fuck, Gene?

22:06.931 --> 22:10.301
- Sorry, I almost hit
a whole family of opossums.

22:10.301 --> 22:11.769
- Just call Bishop.

22:12.804 --> 22:14.372
Fucking asshole.

22:47.572 --> 22:48.506
- Hey, Gene.

22:48.506 --> 22:49.574
- Hi, Todd.

22:49.574 --> 22:50.842
- It's Bishop.

22:50.842 --> 22:52.910
- Todd, I've
got a job for you.

22:55.012 --> 22:56.481
- What kind of job?

22:56.481 --> 22:58.349
- Oh, just the
important kind, that's all.

22:58.349 --> 23:00.585
So why don't I
text you an address

23:00.585 --> 23:03.688
and you get your heinie
over there and stake it out.

23:03.688 --> 23:05.457
We've got a sweet
little baby lamb

23:05.457 --> 23:06.858
who's wandered
off with something

23:06.858 --> 23:08.593
that doesn't belong to him.

23:08.593 --> 23:10.462
Do you catch my shit?

23:10.462 --> 23:12.029
- No, not really.

23:12.029 --> 23:13.164
What does he have?

23:13.164 --> 23:15.567
- That doesn't
matter to you.

23:15.567 --> 23:16.501
- It doesn't matter.

23:16.501 --> 23:17.869
- That's what I said.

23:17.869 --> 23:19.704
It doesn't matter

23:21.005 --> 23:22.273
to you.

23:22.273 --> 23:24.909
- Well, I think it
would be helpful

23:24.909 --> 23:28.613
to know what this sweet baby
lamb has that's so important.

23:28.613 --> 23:30.214
I mean, how am I
supposed to know

23:30.214 --> 23:31.516
how much pressure to put on?

23:31.516 --> 23:32.750
- He's got
a bunch of money

23:32.750 --> 23:34.686
that belongs to Dr.
Shifflett, all right?

23:34.686 --> 23:36.220
He stole it.

23:36.220 --> 23:38.155
And we want it back.

23:38.155 --> 23:39.657
Jesus.

23:39.657 --> 23:41.859
Sense of entitlement
in these kids.

23:41.859 --> 23:43.294
- I don't know, Gene.

23:43.294 --> 23:44.529
Gotta work in the morning.

23:44.529 --> 23:48.399
Got a new job, new
life, new house, so.

23:48.399 --> 23:49.634
- No, you don't.

23:49.634 --> 23:50.301
You live with your
crazy French mother

23:50.301 --> 23:50.902
and you hate it.

23:53.370 --> 23:54.338
- Look, Gene.

23:54.338 --> 23:57.408
- Daddy's not asking, sweet pea.

23:57.408 --> 24:00.444
- I know I owe
Shifflett a lot, but-

24:00.444 --> 24:01.378
- Hey.

24:01.378 --> 24:05.082
Do you want off my list or not?

24:05.082 --> 24:07.819
You do this and that happens.

24:07.819 --> 24:08.653
- List?

24:09.887 --> 24:11.122
What list?

24:11.122 --> 24:14.425
- You know what
list, smarty man.

24:15.793 --> 24:16.994
You know.

24:16.994 --> 24:18.029
- Oh, shit.

24:19.797 --> 24:21.032
That list.

24:21.032 --> 24:23.200
- Oh!

24:23.200 --> 24:26.137
That shit list is
right, my friend.

24:27.271 --> 24:28.973
Now, why don't you
get yourself together,

24:28.973 --> 24:32.376
get over there and
get this the F done.

25:08.980 --> 25:10.615
- Lights up, Jim Cagney.

25:15.687 --> 25:16.554
What's up?

25:17.521 --> 25:18.355
No.

25:19.323 --> 25:21.125
Throw one away.

25:21.125 --> 25:22.459
What's up, bitch?

25:23.394 --> 25:24.195
No.

25:24.195 --> 25:25.029
What's up, bitch?

25:25.029 --> 25:26.063
No, way too much.

25:26.063 --> 25:27.599
Way too much.

25:27.599 --> 25:28.933
Scale it back.

25:28.933 --> 25:30.334
Be softspoken.

25:30.334 --> 25:32.369
Be charming, you know?

25:32.369 --> 25:33.771
But firm.

25:33.771 --> 25:35.072
Chest hair.

25:36.440 --> 25:37.742
Eastwood.

25:44.682 --> 25:47.118
Hey, you scared?

25:48.886 --> 25:49.721
Yeah.

25:51.355 --> 25:52.824
Yeah, like that.

25:52.824 --> 25:53.625
Now...

25:54.692 --> 25:56.027
Do me a favor.

25:57.995 --> 25:59.864
Don't scream.

26:04.235 --> 26:05.402
Wow.

26:05.402 --> 26:07.739
That's some Oscar
level shit right there.

26:16.781 --> 26:19.183
- Andy, what the hell
are you doing here?

26:20.652 --> 26:21.986
Ummmmm

26:23.454 --> 26:25.056
$3 million?

26:25.056 --> 26:27.124
You stole $3 million
from your boss?

26:27.124 --> 26:28.325
Are you insane?

26:28.325 --> 26:29.293
- No.

26:29.293 --> 26:31.228
- You're his accountant.

26:31.228 --> 26:33.998
- You know, I was more of
like a bill collector really.

26:35.399 --> 26:37.935
- Yeah, so what
you still stole from him.

26:37.935 --> 26:39.270
- The guy's evil, Joy.

26:39.270 --> 26:40.471
I had to.

26:40.471 --> 26:41.572
- What do you
mean you had to?

26:41.572 --> 26:43.207
I mean, you're not a criminal.

26:43.207 --> 26:44.642
Your life is good.

26:44.642 --> 26:45.710
- Yeah, hardly.

26:45.710 --> 26:47.679
You have no idea
how truly shitty

26:47.679 --> 26:49.313
and soul crushing my life is.

26:49.313 --> 26:51.248
- Okay, why do
you say he's evil?

26:51.248 --> 26:53.685
- Tax fraud, fraud, evasion.

26:53.685 --> 26:55.653
I think he was running
illegal prescription drugs

26:55.653 --> 26:57.121
with this guy, Gene.

26:57.121 --> 27:00.024
He wanted me to set up
overseas accounts for him

27:00.024 --> 27:01.759
just so he could run.

27:01.759 --> 27:03.027
And I almost did it too.

27:03.027 --> 27:05.429
- But Andy, I mean,
you stole from him.

27:05.429 --> 27:07.498
You know he can go to
prison for this, right?

27:07.498 --> 27:08.866
Where's the money now?

27:08.866 --> 27:10.301
- It's safe.

27:10.301 --> 27:11.268
It's in a place.

27:11.268 --> 27:12.336
- It's in a place.

27:12.336 --> 27:14.371
Oh my God, who are you?

27:14.371 --> 27:17.241
- I have no idea and
it feels amazing.

27:17.241 --> 27:18.442
- God.

27:18.442 --> 27:20.912
- What if he has guys
coming after you?

27:20.912 --> 27:23.480
- He's a plastic surgeon
from Wilmette, Joy,

27:23.480 --> 27:26.050
not a mafia boss
from the seventies.

27:26.050 --> 27:27.584
He doesn't have guys.

27:27.584 --> 27:30.287
- Andy, you disappeared
the same day his money did.

27:30.287 --> 27:31.455
He's gonna come after you.

27:31.455 --> 27:32.556
You know that, right?

27:36.460 --> 27:37.394
- Oh, wow.

27:37.394 --> 27:39.063
Andy's dad died recently.

27:39.964 --> 27:41.598
Unexpected heart attack.

27:42.533 --> 27:43.634
Jesus, he was really young.

27:45.703 --> 27:46.537
- Dave.

27:50.074 --> 27:52.643
Ahh, Shit.

27:52.643 --> 27:54.645
They tracked Andy to LA.

27:54.645 --> 27:55.479
- Oh shit.

27:55.479 --> 27:56.814
What about Shifflett?

27:56.814 --> 28:00.551
- No, he's definitely,
he's still here.

28:00.551 --> 28:02.586
- Oh, we're good though.

28:19.971 --> 28:22.306
Who loves you, kid?

28:22.306 --> 28:24.075
- Hey, hey.

28:25.342 --> 28:27.111
Hey.

28:27.111 --> 28:28.780
Fucker, you want some coffee?

28:36.720 --> 28:38.522
Wait, how did you
call me last night?

28:38.522 --> 28:39.456
- I have my phone.

28:39.456 --> 28:40.792
Why?
- Is it a burner phone?

28:40.792 --> 28:41.625
- What?

28:43.527 --> 28:45.562
- This is your real phone?

28:45.562 --> 28:46.764
- Yeah.

28:46.764 --> 28:48.199
- This is why you're
not a criminal.

28:48.199 --> 28:50.367
You don't even have a
security code on this thing.

28:50.367 --> 28:51.202
Okay, you know what?

28:51.202 --> 28:52.269
It's off.

28:52.269 --> 28:53.070
Andy, you need to leave.
- Ow, Jesus.

28:53.070 --> 28:54.571
- I need you to leave.

28:54.571 --> 28:55.506
- You know, I'm not trying
to get you into trouble.

28:55.506 --> 28:56.740
- I know Andy, but you called me

28:56.740 --> 28:58.275
so now they know who I am.

28:58.275 --> 29:00.011
And I'm sorry,
you have to leave.

29:00.011 --> 29:03.580
All right, here, I'll
give you my number.

29:03.580 --> 29:05.616
All right, now, you
get rid of that phone

29:05.616 --> 29:06.851
and you get a prepaid phone.

29:06.851 --> 29:08.986
And don't call
anyone in Chicago.

29:08.986 --> 29:10.855
Actually, don't call
anyone at all, okay?

29:10.855 --> 29:12.356
- Okay.
- Okay.

29:12.356 --> 29:14.325
Now, look at me and tell me
that you're gonna leave town.

29:14.325 --> 29:15.626
Okay, promise me you'll do that.

29:15.626 --> 29:16.460
- My bag.

29:18.996 --> 29:20.031
- There's your bag.

29:20.031 --> 29:20.865
Here.

29:20.865 --> 29:21.833
Now, do you promise me?

29:21.833 --> 29:22.666
- No.

29:22.666 --> 29:23.700
- Why not?

29:23.700 --> 29:25.169
- Please God, with the yelling.

29:25.169 --> 29:26.971
- Why not?

29:26.971 --> 29:28.372
- Because there's some
things I gotta do, okay?

29:28.372 --> 29:29.673
- What are you hiding?

29:29.673 --> 29:30.674
- Look, it's important.

29:30.674 --> 29:31.508
I have to do-

29:31.508 --> 29:33.110
- Andy, I love you,

29:33.110 --> 29:35.746
but you're being a really big
asshole right now, all right?

29:35.746 --> 29:37.714
This is not a game, man.
- I know it's not game.

29:37.714 --> 29:39.350
- This is just
some serious shit.

29:41.085 --> 29:43.187
Just promise me you'll
do the right thing.

29:43.187 --> 29:46.023
- I will, after tomorrow.

29:46.023 --> 29:46.858
- Oh my God.

29:46.858 --> 29:47.691
All right, just go.

29:47.691 --> 29:48.525
Just leave.

29:49.493 --> 29:50.627
Leave!

29:50.627 --> 29:51.462
- Yeah, yeah.

29:51.462 --> 29:52.529
Hey, Dr. Shifflett.

29:52.529 --> 29:53.797
No, I found him,

29:53.797 --> 29:57.902
but Gene texted me
the wrong address.

29:57.902 --> 29:59.203
But guess what?

29:59.203 --> 30:01.338
I tracked that sweet
baby lamb's phone.

30:01.338 --> 30:03.975
- I want him
and my fucking money tonight

30:03.975 --> 30:07.879
or I swear to God, I'll murder
every single one of you.

30:13.951 --> 30:15.219
Fucking amateurs.

30:16.153 --> 30:16.988
- Yeah.

30:18.856 --> 30:19.690
Yeah.

30:32.469 --> 30:35.339
* You think nothing
can touch you *

30:35.339 --> 30:38.209
* You think you got it made

30:38.209 --> 30:40.912
* There is a judge above you

30:40.912 --> 30:45.883
* Gonna catch up
with you one day *

30:46.817 --> 30:49.653
* You say you run with devil

30:49.653 --> 30:52.523
* You say you're not afraid

30:52.523 --> 30:55.026
* I see an angry angel

30:55.026 --> 30:59.997
* Gonna catch up
with you one day *

31:01.398 --> 31:06.403
* If your soul is sorry

31:07.171 --> 31:12.076
* You might be saved

31:12.977 --> 31:17.248
* But if your heart is heavy

31:17.248 --> 31:21.418
* Gonna catch up
with you one day *

31:29.927 --> 31:32.863
* Gonna catch up
with you one day *

31:32.863 --> 31:37.868
* Better watch out

31:38.769 --> 31:41.005
* You can't run forever

31:41.005 --> 31:43.941
* You're gonna kneel and pray

31:43.941 --> 31:48.912
* The Book of Revelations' gonna
catch up with you one day *

31:52.984 --> 31:57.955
* If your soul is sorry

31:58.755 --> 32:03.527
* You might be saved

32:04.428 --> 32:08.699
* But if your heart is heavy

32:08.699 --> 32:12.970
* Gonna catch up
with you one day *

32:27.618 --> 32:28.619
- My name's Mel.

32:28.619 --> 32:29.720
What do they call you?

32:29.720 --> 32:30.621
- Just Andy.

32:31.522 --> 32:33.090
- Well shit, Just Andy.

32:33.090 --> 32:34.625
Let's get you
squared away, okay?

32:34.625 --> 32:37.995
We're gonna take good care of
you, real good care of you.

32:37.995 --> 32:40.131
- You a screenwriter
or something?

32:40.131 --> 32:41.065
- Oh that.

32:41.065 --> 32:43.267
Yeah, some.

32:43.267 --> 32:44.868
Sold, one few years ago.

32:44.868 --> 32:46.503
I write for myself, mainly.

32:46.503 --> 32:47.471
- Hope it works out.

32:47.471 --> 32:48.605
- It won't.

32:48.605 --> 32:49.906
But here you go.

32:51.708 --> 32:53.844
- So we gonna sign some
paperwork or something?

32:53.844 --> 32:56.047
- Hell no, Just Andy.

32:56.047 --> 32:57.814
Paperwork's for
shitass corporations.

32:57.814 --> 32:59.883
This here, family-owned.

32:59.883 --> 33:01.485
The way we firm this fucker up

33:01.485 --> 33:03.720
is we have ourselves
a little shot.

33:03.720 --> 33:06.490
- Management makes you do shots
every time you book a room?

33:06.490 --> 33:07.891
- I am management.

33:07.891 --> 33:08.725
Here's to us.

33:15.632 --> 33:17.000
- So what's your
screenplay about?

33:18.302 --> 33:19.170
- Guns.

33:25.876 --> 33:28.712
* You think nothing
can touch you *

33:28.712 --> 33:31.615
* You think you got it made

33:31.615 --> 33:34.218
* There is a judge above you

33:34.218 --> 33:39.223
* Gonna catch up
with you one day *

33:40.724 --> 33:45.729
* If your soul is sorry

33:46.497 --> 33:51.368
* You might be saved

33:52.269 --> 33:53.537
* But if your heart is heavy

33:53.537 --> 33:54.371
- Oh fuck.

33:56.540 --> 34:00.711
* Gonna catch up
with you one day *

34:12.723 --> 34:13.757
- What the fuck, Gene?

34:13.757 --> 34:15.259
- Sorry, doctor.

34:15.259 --> 34:19.663
- I'm about to rip your head
off your disgusting body!

34:19.663 --> 34:20.631
Can you hear me?

34:20.631 --> 34:22.065
- That's my ear, doctor!

34:22.065 --> 34:22.899
- Fuck!

34:40.884 --> 34:42.119
- Howdy.

34:42.119 --> 34:44.888
- Hey, random question.

34:44.888 --> 34:47.424
Would you happen to have
a car that I could borrow

34:47.424 --> 34:48.592
for just a few hours?

34:48.592 --> 34:49.993
That's it, just a few hours.

34:53.430 --> 34:54.931
I just, you know,

34:54.931 --> 34:56.133
thought we got along so well
earlier that maybe, you know,

34:56.133 --> 34:57.534
you might have a
car I could borrow.

34:57.534 --> 35:00.371
- Cars ain't never held
my personality right.

35:00.371 --> 35:03.407
But I do have a sexy
ass truck out there,

35:03.407 --> 35:05.742
if that might interest you.

35:05.742 --> 35:06.677
- Does it work?

35:06.677 --> 35:08.078
- With a little motivation,

35:09.880 --> 35:11.882
I'm sure she'll run just fine.

35:26.530 --> 35:27.798
She's right outside.

35:27.798 --> 35:28.932
- Keys.

35:28.932 --> 35:29.866
- In the visor.

35:30.901 --> 35:31.735
- Just like in the movies.

35:31.735 --> 35:32.569
- That's it.

36:16.347 --> 36:17.848
- You're the janitor, right?

36:19.082 --> 36:20.917
You wanna help me
out with something?

36:20.917 --> 36:23.254
I'll totally make it worth
your while, I promise.

36:28.124 --> 36:28.959
Hop on in.

36:37.133 --> 36:39.603
- Oh, hey.

36:39.603 --> 36:40.837
- Who the hell are you?

36:40.837 --> 36:42.973
- Oh, baby, I'm the
new man in your life.

36:42.973 --> 36:46.677
Hey, do us a favor,
don't scream.

36:49.112 --> 36:50.514
Are you scared?

36:50.514 --> 36:51.348
- Yes.

36:51.348 --> 36:52.182
- Good.

36:52.182 --> 36:53.650
Now, walk.

36:53.650 --> 36:54.485
- Okay.

36:54.485 --> 36:55.486
- There you go.

36:55.486 --> 36:56.853
Nice and easy.

36:56.853 --> 36:58.121
- Okay.
- Move it, toots.

36:58.121 --> 36:59.055
Okay, I'm moving.
- Let's go, move.

36:59.055 --> 37:00.156
- I'm moving, I'm moving.

37:06.263 --> 37:08.299
- Where's Andy, your pal?

37:08.299 --> 37:11.768
- I don't know.

37:11.768 --> 37:13.036
I don't know.

37:13.036 --> 37:15.071
He was here and then
I asked him to leave

37:15.071 --> 37:16.473
so he left.

37:16.473 --> 37:17.741
I don't know where he is.

37:21.878 --> 37:22.813
- Okay.

37:22.813 --> 37:23.914
I believe you.

37:23.914 --> 37:25.048
- It's the truth.

37:25.048 --> 37:25.949
- I know.

37:27.050 --> 37:27.884
Sit.

37:29.286 --> 37:30.120
- Okay.

37:36.760 --> 37:38.729
- He told you what
he did, didn't he?

37:38.729 --> 37:40.063
- Yeah, he stole some money.

37:40.063 --> 37:41.298
- Yes, he did.

37:41.298 --> 37:44.568
And my boss wants
it back tonight,

37:45.736 --> 37:47.237
which means I want
it back tonight,

37:47.237 --> 37:50.040
which means Andy has
to give it to me when?

37:50.040 --> 37:50.874
- Tonight.

37:50.874 --> 37:51.708
- Beautiful.

37:51.708 --> 37:52.943
She learns.

37:52.943 --> 37:56.647
Now, how do we make that happen?

37:58.682 --> 37:59.883
Did he tell you where it is?

37:59.883 --> 38:01.618
- He said it was in a place.

38:01.618 --> 38:03.253
- In a place.

38:03.253 --> 38:05.589
Who the hell talks like that?

38:05.589 --> 38:06.423
Come here.

38:06.423 --> 38:07.257
Yeah.

38:08.392 --> 38:12.563
Me and you, we're in
this shit here together,

38:12.563 --> 38:13.497
so help me find the money.

38:13.497 --> 38:14.965
- You've got a gun on me.

38:14.965 --> 38:17.200
I don't think this is together.

38:17.200 --> 38:18.735
- We're in this together.

38:18.735 --> 38:20.203
- Okay.

38:20.203 --> 38:22.839
- So help me find the money
and nothing bad happens,

38:26.477 --> 38:27.310
I promise.

38:28.579 --> 38:29.546
Yeah.

38:29.546 --> 38:30.681
There it is.

38:35.552 --> 38:36.387
- Okay.

38:36.387 --> 38:37.320
Okay.

38:37.320 --> 38:38.589
He's gonna call me later.

38:39.523 --> 38:40.357
- Good.

38:44.928 --> 38:47.631
That's a lovely adobe
walkway you have there.

38:47.631 --> 38:48.465
- Thanks.

38:48.465 --> 38:49.299
- It is adobe, right?

38:50.266 --> 38:51.368
- I don't really know.

39:00.944 --> 39:02.245
- Hell yeah, man.

39:03.113 --> 39:03.947
Good for you.

39:03.947 --> 39:05.549
You know, good for you.

39:05.549 --> 39:06.717
Screw that.

39:06.717 --> 39:08.385
You don't need that place.

39:08.385 --> 39:10.020
Stupid job.

39:11.121 --> 39:11.955
I had a bad job.

39:11.955 --> 39:13.857
I had a bad boss.

39:13.857 --> 39:14.791
Had a bad life.

39:14.791 --> 39:15.726
You know, good for us, man.

39:15.726 --> 39:17.794
We're changing stuff, you know?

39:17.794 --> 39:22.298
We're changing everything.

39:22.298 --> 39:23.133
All right, I'll be back.

39:56.099 --> 39:56.933
- There it is.

39:56.933 --> 39:58.101
Get it.

39:58.101 --> 39:59.570
- Hey, Andy.

39:59.570 --> 40:00.771
I thought you weren't gonna
use this phone anymore.

40:00.771 --> 40:02.205
Remember, you lied to me.

40:02.205 --> 40:03.674
- I didn't have time
to get a burner.

40:03.674 --> 40:04.941
- You don't listen.

40:04.941 --> 40:07.343
- No, they don't know
about you, I promise.

40:07.343 --> 40:08.411
Are you home now?

40:08.411 --> 40:09.646
- Yes.

40:09.646 --> 40:10.647
- Okay, can you
meet me somewhere?

40:12.315 --> 40:13.249
- Sure.

40:13.249 --> 40:15.486
- Meet me at Terry Kaufman Park.

40:15.486 --> 40:16.853
Meet me there in an hour.

40:16.853 --> 40:17.988
- Okay, Andy-

40:19.089 --> 40:20.624
- Really?

40:20.624 --> 40:23.026
I swear to Christ, if you
give me any shit tonight.

40:31.434 --> 40:33.169
Does he know what
kind of car you drive?

40:33.169 --> 40:34.037
- No.

40:34.037 --> 40:34.871
- Good.

40:34.871 --> 40:35.739
We'll take mine.

40:35.739 --> 40:37.373
Let's go.

40:46.149 --> 40:47.450
- Track me now, bitch.

40:56.827 --> 40:58.695
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

40:58.695 --> 40:59.530
Oh my God, oh my God.

40:59.530 --> 41:00.764
Buckle up.

41:00.764 --> 41:01.565
Buckle up.

41:01.565 --> 41:02.499
We're flying.

41:02.499 --> 41:03.667
Hold on to your ball bag, bro.

41:04.535 --> 41:05.468
- Fuck you.

41:05.468 --> 41:06.503
I can do a hundred push-ups.

41:06.503 --> 41:07.504
- For shit.

41:07.504 --> 41:08.572
Let's see it.

41:08.572 --> 41:09.940
Right now, you wanna see?

41:09.940 --> 41:11.174
- No, tomorrow.

41:11.174 --> 41:12.308
- No, get out of the car then.
- Right now.

41:12.308 --> 41:14.377
- Get outta the car then.

41:15.712 --> 41:17.548
- Don't try any funny stuff.

41:17.548 --> 41:18.715
- Okay.

41:18.715 --> 41:20.083
- So where are you from anyway?

41:20.083 --> 41:21.685
- Zihuatanejo.

41:21.685 --> 41:23.787
- Ah, you know Andy Dufresne?

41:25.088 --> 41:27.023
How could you be so obtuse?

41:27.891 --> 41:29.125
Is it deliberate?

41:32.195 --> 41:33.329
Shawshank.

41:34.798 --> 41:38.201
- Andy and I grew up together
and you know she is harmless.

41:38.201 --> 41:40.303
- Yeah, well, if old
Andy boy was so harmless,

41:40.303 --> 41:43.339
you wouldn't be driving around
LA with a gun in your back,

41:43.339 --> 41:44.575
would you?

41:44.575 --> 41:45.676
- Just promise me you're
not gonna hurt him.

41:45.676 --> 41:47.811
- Would you just drive, mom?

41:47.811 --> 41:48.979
Jesus.

41:48.979 --> 41:50.113
- You know, you are an adult.

41:50.113 --> 41:51.782
You can make your own decisions.

41:51.782 --> 41:54.084
I mean, everyone has choices.

41:54.084 --> 41:56.386
- Are you quoting your
own book to me right now?

41:56.386 --> 41:57.353
- Wait, you read it?

41:57.353 --> 41:59.489
- Dude, watch the road!

41:59.489 --> 42:00.557
Geez.

42:00.557 --> 42:02.559
- Did you like it?

42:02.559 --> 42:04.661
- I'm not really a
short stories guy.

42:04.661 --> 42:05.528
- Yeah, I get it.

42:05.528 --> 42:06.362
Totally.

42:06.362 --> 42:08.364
Not a short stories guy.

42:11.334 --> 42:12.268
- Yours were okay.

42:17.107 --> 42:17.941
- 88.

42:17.941 --> 42:18.775
- Minus 78.

42:20.476 --> 42:21.311
- Fuck you.

42:21.311 --> 42:22.779
- Such a good movie.

42:22.779 --> 42:24.380
Except for I never
understand that last part

42:24.380 --> 42:25.215
because he-
- Mumbles.

42:25.215 --> 42:26.416
- Mumbles it!

42:26.416 --> 42:27.217
He mumbles it.

42:27.217 --> 42:28.585
Yeah.

42:30.320 --> 42:31.588
Oh, you ever do that?

42:31.588 --> 42:32.656
You ever get like
song lyrics wrong

42:32.656 --> 42:33.924
or, you know, movie quotes wrong

42:33.924 --> 42:36.392
and you realize you've
been doing it forever?

42:36.392 --> 42:38.161
God, I'm such an idiot.

42:38.161 --> 42:39.996
I embarrass so easily too.

42:49.439 --> 42:50.741
- Yeah, I need
you to track that number

42:50.741 --> 42:51.541
that I gave you.

42:52.909 --> 42:54.310
Are you sure?

42:54.310 --> 42:55.111
Okay.

42:56.112 --> 42:56.980
Well, he's here.

42:58.248 --> 42:59.816
That means get out.

43:08.158 --> 43:10.727
Hey, young Teri,
what've you got for us?

43:10.727 --> 43:13.864
- We tracked Andy's phone
to an alley in downtown LA.

43:13.864 --> 43:16.299
Found security cam footage.

43:16.299 --> 43:17.701
Check this shit out.

43:17.701 --> 43:19.870
- We had a warrant
for his phone?

43:19.870 --> 43:21.738
- Of course we did.

43:27.911 --> 43:30.413
They must have lured
him into the alley.

43:30.413 --> 43:32.582
I think there was a money
exchange or something.

43:32.582 --> 43:34.417
- I don't negotiate
with terrorists.

43:34.417 --> 43:35.686
Tell me where the money is

43:35.686 --> 43:36.920
or I shoot the shit
out of both of you.

43:36.920 --> 43:38.554
- Put the gun away
or the money's gone.

43:38.554 --> 43:39.856
I swear to God, it's gone.

43:39.856 --> 43:40.957
- Until...

43:45.395 --> 43:46.462
- Jesus.

43:46.462 --> 43:47.864
They tased the guy?

43:48.699 --> 43:49.599
- Great job, man.

43:49.599 --> 43:50.767
- What the fuck?

43:50.767 --> 43:52.302
So I was bait?

43:52.302 --> 43:53.737
- Yeah, I had to get
him out here somehow.

43:53.737 --> 43:55.371
- Are you fucking kidding me?

43:55.371 --> 43:56.907
You asshole.

43:56.907 --> 43:59.409
- They threw his ass in the
back of a truck and drove off.

44:00.443 --> 44:02.445
All right, detectives,
I gotta run.

44:02.445 --> 44:05.581
- Hey, you sure you don't
a swig there, cheese dick?

44:05.581 --> 44:09.385
- It'll make the metal in
your mouth real tingly.

44:12.923 --> 44:15.158
- God, I wish I was his age.

44:15.158 --> 44:16.793
- Fucking handsome prick.

44:16.793 --> 44:18.528
Bet he gets his dick
wet every night.

44:18.528 --> 44:20.496
- Yeah, I miss those days.

44:20.496 --> 44:22.165
- You never had those days.

44:37.513 --> 44:41.718
* That's what I want

44:41.718 --> 44:46.122
* I won't sleep till
that's what I got *

44:46.122 --> 44:51.127
* The whole wide
world in my hand *

44:52.763 --> 44:57.500
* That's what I want

44:57.500 --> 45:01.071
* That's what I want

45:01.071 --> 45:03.339
- Does Shifflett know about Joy?

45:03.339 --> 45:04.607
That's all I want to know.

45:04.607 --> 45:05.441
- No.

45:05.441 --> 45:06.276
- See?

45:06.276 --> 45:07.510
- Oh, good.

45:07.510 --> 45:08.444
It's settled then.

45:08.444 --> 45:10.480
Of course, he's not lying.

45:10.480 --> 45:11.714
- I'm not.

45:11.714 --> 45:12.983
- How many people
have you killed?

45:12.983 --> 45:14.217
- None.

45:14.217 --> 45:15.718
- Dude, you
are such a liar.

45:15.718 --> 45:18.789
- Look, I was roofing houses
in Burbank a week ago.

45:18.789 --> 45:20.390
Look at Andy's pocket.

45:20.390 --> 45:21.224
Do it.

45:21.224 --> 45:22.826
Get in his shit.

45:22.826 --> 45:24.727
- What's in Andy's pocket?

45:28.064 --> 45:29.265
What the hell is this?

45:30.801 --> 45:32.268
- Is that a prop gun?

45:32.268 --> 45:34.404
- I got it one of those
novelty shops in Hollywood.

45:34.404 --> 45:35.972
Looks real, doesn't it?

45:35.972 --> 45:39.509
I know you probably think I'm
this international assassin,

45:39.509 --> 45:41.044
badass, kidnapper guy,

45:41.044 --> 45:43.980
but Shifflett paid for
my contractor's license.

45:43.980 --> 45:45.215
I owe him.

45:45.215 --> 45:46.783
He's the only reason I'm here.

45:46.783 --> 45:48.351
- You're a fucking roofer?

46:07.170 --> 46:09.672
- We can track Bishop's phone.

46:11.107 --> 46:14.310
- I can track any phone anytime.

46:15.178 --> 46:17.047
It's what I did for the Corp.

46:17.047 --> 46:18.214
You see, Peter...

46:30.726 --> 46:35.731
What I did was I hid all of
my surveillance equipment

46:36.900 --> 46:40.837
in the garage
during the divorce.

46:40.837 --> 46:43.306
Jackie didn't get any of it.

46:44.841 --> 46:45.909
Nope.

46:47.277 --> 46:52.048
And it's because she
did not know about it,

46:52.048 --> 46:56.319
because I hid it in the garage

46:56.319 --> 46:57.153
during our

46:58.855 --> 46:59.689
painful,

47:01.724 --> 47:02.558
prolonged

47:04.961 --> 47:06.897
uncoupling phase.

47:06.897 --> 47:08.331
- Christ.

47:08.331 --> 47:12.502
- She did not know about
it or that it even existed

47:15.071 --> 47:17.273
because what I did was-

47:17.273 --> 47:21.444
- Just let
me know when you find him.

47:21.444 --> 47:23.079
Okay, big guy?

47:23.079 --> 47:25.515
- Thank you for trusting me.

47:25.515 --> 47:28.885
I will never disappoint you.

47:28.885 --> 47:30.220
After the divorce,

47:32.755 --> 47:35.125
I was looking for purpose

47:35.125 --> 47:35.959
and

47:37.460 --> 47:40.096
meaning in my life,

47:40.096 --> 47:45.101
and you came along at
just the right time

47:46.569 --> 47:50.340
and gave me an opportunity
to sell prescription drugs

47:51.607 --> 47:54.644
and murder people for you.

47:56.779 --> 47:57.613
You

47:58.814 --> 48:00.283
saved my-

48:00.283 --> 48:03.119
- You should
probably crack on now.

48:04.454 --> 48:05.255
Okay, Gene?

48:07.157 --> 48:07.958
Off you pop.

48:23.039 --> 48:24.840
- Want twig and berries?

48:24.840 --> 48:26.943
- Not the twig,
just the berries.

48:30.280 --> 48:31.547
- Come on, bro.

48:31.547 --> 48:33.049
It was a prop gun.

48:33.049 --> 48:34.517
Shit wasn't even real.

48:36.219 --> 48:37.487
We all have choices.

48:42.025 --> 48:42.858
Okay, okay, all right.

48:42.858 --> 48:44.060
I'll play ball.

48:44.060 --> 48:45.495
Gene and Shifflett
flew in today.

48:45.495 --> 48:49.799
Gene's got a bunch of this
really creepy tracking software.

48:49.799 --> 48:51.567
He's tracking your
phone right now.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.536
- So if you have a
plan, you have to tell me.

50:37.273 --> 50:38.074
Well?

50:40.110 --> 50:41.711
What the hell are you doing?

50:41.711 --> 50:44.114
- What, I smoke sometimes
when I'm feeling stressed.

50:44.114 --> 50:46.182
- You can't run away
from these people forever, man.

50:46.182 --> 50:47.917
Don't you know how this
business works, Andy?

50:47.917 --> 50:50.120
- Yes, I know how
this business works, Joy.

50:50.120 --> 50:52.088
Don't talk to me like
I don't know stuff.

50:52.088 --> 50:52.922
I'm sick of that.

50:52.922 --> 50:54.457
- Fine, okay?

50:54.457 --> 50:56.792
But you know I can't go
home until we settle this.

50:56.792 --> 51:00.363
So I need to know now
what the fuck the plan is.

51:00.363 --> 51:01.831
- I don't know yet.

51:05.101 --> 51:05.935
I'm sorry.

51:07.337 --> 51:10.840
- You come here and you
completely destroy my life

51:10.840 --> 51:11.941
and you're sorry?

51:12.808 --> 51:14.477
You know, fuck you, Andy.

51:14.477 --> 51:15.311
- Okay.

51:16.712 --> 51:18.648
- Come on, I'm formulating a-

51:18.648 --> 51:19.515
I'm sorry.

51:23.386 --> 51:24.520
- Oh my God.

51:24.520 --> 51:25.688
- What?

51:28.624 --> 51:29.625
- Come here.

52:42.665 --> 52:43.866
Give me your phone.

52:43.866 --> 52:45.100
- Why?
- Just give me

52:45.100 --> 52:48.338
your fucking phone.
- Give her the phone!

52:51.241 --> 52:52.074
- Hey!

52:52.074 --> 52:53.409
I got pictures on there.

53:20.736 --> 53:23.373
- What the fuck is that?

53:23.373 --> 53:24.807
- It's a SoCal Special, sir.

53:24.807 --> 53:28.644
It's a baby spinach, pineapple
white sauce pizza with,

53:29.545 --> 53:30.980
well, cilantro,

53:32.615 --> 53:34.149
oregano accents,

53:34.149 --> 53:37.653
various maudling roots, craned
carrot stalk, which you know,

53:37.653 --> 53:38.788
all combines for a very-

53:38.788 --> 53:40.456
- I thought I ordered
a pizza, mate.

53:40.456 --> 53:41.691
- It is a pizza.

53:41.691 --> 53:42.625
- No,
that's a pair of panties

53:42.625 --> 53:43.526
that you've whipped up in there.

53:43.526 --> 53:44.727
That's what that is.

53:44.727 --> 53:45.695
Fuck it, give it.

53:45.695 --> 53:47.196
I'm starving.

53:47.196 --> 53:49.599
- That'll be 34 even, sir.

53:49.599 --> 53:51.401
- $34.

53:51.401 --> 53:52.234
- Yes.

53:56.939 --> 53:58.007
- No tip.

53:58.007 --> 53:59.942
- Lesson learned, bitch.

53:59.942 --> 54:01.043
- And
don't you forget it.

54:05.748 --> 54:06.882
You better have some
good news for me, Gene

54:06.882 --> 54:08.618
or I swear to Christ.

54:08.618 --> 54:10.085
- I found them.

54:10.085 --> 54:11.120
- And my money?

54:11.120 --> 54:12.855
- No, not yet.

54:12.855 --> 54:15.425
There's someone else with them.

54:16.526 --> 54:18.494
Some big Mexican fella.

54:20.630 --> 54:21.464
- All right.

54:22.598 --> 54:23.566
Do whatever you want
with the others.

54:23.566 --> 54:25.234
But Andy's mine, understand me?

54:25.234 --> 54:26.569
- Yes.

54:26.569 --> 54:28.738
- I can't hear you, Gene.

54:28.738 --> 54:32.207
- I said yes, Peter, all yours.

54:36.546 --> 54:38.113
- Snookie want some num-nums?

55:05.375 --> 55:06.842
- All right, we
don't know who's out there.

55:06.842 --> 55:08.378
Okay, here's what
we're gonna do.

55:08.378 --> 55:09.311
I think you guys should hold
hands like you're a couple.

55:09.311 --> 55:10.546
Then you'll go for-

55:10.546 --> 55:11.347
Yeah, come on, come
on, let's try it.

55:11.347 --> 55:12.815
Let's just try it.

55:12.815 --> 55:13.483
Pretend like you're a couple,
so just, let's just do it.

55:13.483 --> 55:14.249
- Don't worry.

55:15.818 --> 55:16.852
You're safe.

55:16.852 --> 55:17.687
- I'm worried.

55:21.557 --> 55:22.392
- Oh, hey, Gene.

55:22.392 --> 55:23.826
- Hola.

55:24.660 --> 55:25.595
Little shit!

55:26.996 --> 55:30.466
I am calling your father
the minute I get home, Todd.

55:30.466 --> 55:31.767
- I thought his name was Bishop.

55:31.767 --> 55:33.669
- Bishop is his last name.

55:33.669 --> 55:35.771
He thinks it makes
him sound cooler.

55:35.771 --> 55:36.872
You're not cool.

55:38.908 --> 55:40.810
Andy Fielder.

55:40.810 --> 55:43.278
You dickless little worm turd.

55:43.278 --> 55:44.980
When Peter told me

55:44.980 --> 55:48.418
that you were the one
who stole his money.

55:50.920 --> 55:52.354
How dare you!

55:52.354 --> 55:54.023
All right, everybody
in the corner.

55:54.023 --> 55:55.525
Come on, in the corner.

55:55.525 --> 55:56.392
Let's go.

55:56.392 --> 55:57.593
Yep.

56:08.471 --> 56:09.304
All right.

56:10.740 --> 56:11.674
Into the bathroom.

56:11.674 --> 56:13.342
Everybody into the bathroom.

56:13.342 --> 56:14.176
That's right.

56:14.176 --> 56:15.478
Fred.

56:15.478 --> 56:16.612
Daphne.

56:16.612 --> 56:17.580
Shaggy.

56:18.848 --> 56:19.915
Velma.

56:19.915 --> 56:20.750
In you go.

56:21.884 --> 56:22.718
- Dick.

56:39.268 --> 56:40.102
- Damn it!

56:41.571 --> 56:43.205
- Can't believe
he called me Todd.

56:44.273 --> 56:45.207
It's Bishop.

56:45.207 --> 56:46.275
- I need to call my wife.

56:47.543 --> 56:48.878
- Call her right now, man.

56:50.045 --> 56:51.046
- I need to say bye.

56:52.114 --> 56:53.616
- Okay.

56:53.616 --> 56:55.017
- We're not gonna die, are we?
- Yeah, we're not gonna die.

56:55.017 --> 56:56.351
- Looks like it.

57:06.295 --> 57:07.429
- Okay.

57:07.429 --> 57:08.998
You can come out now.

57:13.769 --> 57:14.604
Well...

57:16.105 --> 57:17.640
Anyone?

57:17.640 --> 57:22.645
Andy, everybody is about
to get shot real bad now.

57:23.746 --> 57:25.314
Is that what you want?

57:25.314 --> 57:30.319
Or do you maybe want to
tell me where my money is?

57:31.186 --> 57:31.987
- What do you mean your money?

57:31.987 --> 57:34.023
It's Shifflett's money.

57:38.093 --> 57:39.294
- Right in the Rectus femoris!

57:39.294 --> 57:40.896
- Maybe now you will

57:40.896 --> 57:43.899
keep that smart ass
yapper of yours shut.

57:43.899 --> 57:47.803
And somebody needs to tell
Pop Gun Rodriguez over here

57:47.803 --> 57:52.141
to lower his eyebrows before
I blow them both off his face.

57:52.141 --> 57:52.975
- All right, all right.

57:52.975 --> 57:53.909
Just let them go.

57:53.909 --> 57:55.110
I'll take you.

57:56.245 --> 57:57.980
All right, all right, fuck!

57:57.980 --> 57:58.948
Jesus!

57:58.948 --> 58:00.049
It's in Venice.

58:00.883 --> 58:03.352
- Well, let's go then.

58:03.352 --> 58:05.054
Come on, everybody.

58:05.054 --> 58:05.888
Let's go.

58:07.222 --> 58:08.824
Just the Apache.

58:08.824 --> 58:10.292
I don't want you two

58:10.292 --> 58:14.196
working out another one of
your really smart plans, do I?

58:14.196 --> 58:16.031
Come on, let's go.

58:16.031 --> 58:16.866
Field trip.

58:16.866 --> 58:18.500
Everybody on the bus.

58:36.151 --> 58:37.086
Fuck!

58:37.086 --> 58:38.621
Really, in the fucking ear?

58:40.289 --> 58:41.123
Oh, shit!

58:44.359 --> 58:49.364
Why are you making
me do this to you?

58:58.373 --> 58:59.675
He's coming for you, Andy.

59:01.510 --> 59:03.445
And fuck you, Todd.

59:16.325 --> 59:17.727
- My God, Mel, are you okay?

59:19.228 --> 59:20.062
- I got shot.

59:20.062 --> 59:21.063
No, I'm not okay.

59:23.032 --> 59:24.499
- What can I do?

59:24.499 --> 59:26.101
- You can check this shit out.

59:27.502 --> 59:28.971
- Do you always wear a
bulletproof vest to work?

59:28.971 --> 59:31.240
- Yeah, I work nights and
I pull guns on people.

59:31.240 --> 59:33.042
Of course I wear a
bulletproof fest.

59:34.209 --> 59:35.845
- I thought you were
showing me your tits.

59:37.012 --> 59:37.947
I thought you were
gonna show me your tits.

59:37.947 --> 59:39.982
- I wouldn't put it past me.

59:39.982 --> 59:41.050
- Me neither.

59:53.395 --> 59:54.730
Sun's coming up.

59:54.730 --> 59:56.165
- Yeah, long night.

59:56.165 --> 59:57.232
- Hell yeah.

59:57.232 --> 59:58.267
- How is he?

59:58.267 --> 01:00:00.002
- It's just a flesh wound.

01:00:00.002 --> 01:00:01.470
Don't worry about it.

01:00:01.470 --> 01:00:02.705
I got a bed over in Sylmar
that'll stitch him up.

01:00:02.705 --> 01:00:04.139
- Geez.

01:00:04.139 --> 01:00:06.942
Mel, I am so sorry for-

01:00:06.942 --> 01:00:08.443
- For what?

01:00:08.443 --> 01:00:10.112
For me having some of the
most fun I've had in years?

01:00:10.112 --> 01:00:11.346
Are you kidding me, man?

01:00:11.346 --> 01:00:13.182
I got my "Fistful
of Dollars" moment.

01:00:13.182 --> 01:00:14.684
I should be thanking your ass.

01:00:14.684 --> 01:00:19.655
- What about that asshole
in the room back there?

01:00:20.589 --> 01:00:22.224
- Don't you even
worry about him.

01:00:22.224 --> 01:00:25.828
I'll take out the trash later
on when the dust settles.

01:00:25.828 --> 01:00:27.029
- Thanks for everything.

01:00:47.817 --> 01:00:50.185
- Jesus Christ, Gene, I've
been waiting all night.

01:00:50.185 --> 01:00:51.453
- Gene's dead, Doc.

01:00:51.453 --> 01:00:52.421
You dick.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:58.728
- Where's my money?

01:00:59.929 --> 01:01:01.496
- Let's meet somewhere
and I'll give it to you.

01:01:01.496 --> 01:01:02.331
- Just like that?

01:01:02.331 --> 01:01:03.766
- Just like that.

01:01:03.766 --> 01:01:06.736
- Just
you, me, cops, fucking FBI?

01:01:06.736 --> 01:01:07.569
- Nope.

01:01:07.569 --> 01:01:08.771
Just me, asshole.

01:01:08.771 --> 01:01:10.005
- Not really getting
the angle here, Andrew.

01:01:10.005 --> 01:01:11.106
- Joy.

01:01:11.106 --> 01:01:12.641
She stays out of it.

01:01:12.641 --> 01:01:14.509
If you can promise me that,
you'll have your money back.

01:01:14.509 --> 01:01:16.645
- The big Mexican
stays out of it too.

01:01:16.645 --> 01:01:18.180
- Fine.

01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:20.382
- I don't know why I'm gonna
trust you with this, but...

01:01:20.382 --> 01:01:21.316
- You don't
have a choice.

01:01:21.316 --> 01:01:23.085
I got your balls in a sling.

01:01:26.155 --> 01:01:27.890
- I'll send an address.

01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:28.724
- Okay.

01:01:32.661 --> 01:01:33.996
Fucking asshole.

01:01:42.004 --> 01:01:42.838
- Babe.

01:01:42.838 --> 01:01:43.672
Honey.

01:01:44.974 --> 01:01:46.308
Pumpkin.

01:01:46.308 --> 01:01:49.912
- You killed a guy
with your bare hands.

01:01:49.912 --> 01:01:50.880
- He had it coming.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.281
- I can't believe I saw that.

01:01:53.749 --> 01:01:55.851
Got one more stop to make
if that's okay with you.

01:03:00.182 --> 01:03:01.316
- Be careful with this one.

01:03:03.853 --> 01:03:05.387
Be extra careful with this one.

01:03:07.722 --> 01:03:08.958
It's heavy.

01:03:08.958 --> 01:03:09.892
If your father knew I
was doing this for you,

01:03:09.892 --> 01:03:11.593
he'd crawl up out of his grave

01:03:11.593 --> 01:03:13.728
and kick the living
shit outta me.

01:03:13.728 --> 01:03:15.597
- He'd do the same
thing to me too.

01:03:15.597 --> 01:03:18.968
- I don't want to know why
or what this is even for.

01:03:18.968 --> 01:03:20.535
Just be careful, okay?

01:03:20.535 --> 01:03:21.770
- Look, I know this
looks weird, but-

01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:25.374
- No, you just take
care of yourself, son.

01:03:27.142 --> 01:03:28.978
I hope this helps.

01:04:03.645 --> 01:04:05.380
- This is gonna help.

01:04:34.043 --> 01:04:34.876
Oh God.

01:04:36.311 --> 01:04:37.212
Oh God.

01:04:37.212 --> 01:04:38.047
Oh God!

01:04:41.350 --> 01:04:43.252
I can't feel my thighs.

01:04:47.089 --> 01:04:48.157
Are my eyes bleeding?

01:04:50.192 --> 01:04:51.026
Oh my God.

01:04:52.127 --> 01:04:53.562
Oh God.

01:04:53.562 --> 01:04:54.396
Oh God.

01:04:56.231 --> 01:04:57.632
All right, 7:45 on the nose.

01:05:13.215 --> 01:05:14.383
This is gonna sound weird,

01:05:14.383 --> 01:05:16.986
but pretty sure
you're my best friend.

01:05:18.087 --> 01:05:19.388
- Vaya con dios, amigo.

01:05:26.628 --> 01:05:27.997
- I had a girlfriend once.

01:05:45.614 --> 01:05:46.448
I'm here.

01:05:49.851 --> 01:05:51.020
I'm here.

01:05:56.025 --> 01:05:58.527
Hello, hello.

01:05:58.527 --> 01:06:00.462
Ching, ching, money man.

01:06:06.301 --> 01:06:08.737
You've got a huge
set of balls on you.

01:06:08.737 --> 01:06:10.839
I mean, seriously.

01:06:10.839 --> 01:06:12.507
Where have those
things been, huh?

01:06:13.642 --> 01:06:14.809
- It's just me.

01:06:14.809 --> 01:06:15.644
- Show me.

01:06:17.946 --> 01:06:19.514
- It's all there.

01:06:19.514 --> 01:06:22.551
I mean, I took some for
expenses, but you know.

01:06:22.551 --> 01:06:23.685
- Where's the big Mexican?

01:06:23.685 --> 01:06:25.320
- He's Cuban, actually.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:26.388
He's down the street.

01:06:26.388 --> 01:06:27.189
- Who is he.

01:06:28.323 --> 01:06:29.558
- A friend.

01:06:29.558 --> 01:06:30.725
Best friend, maybe?

01:06:30.725 --> 01:06:32.461
I don't know, I've
never actually had one.

01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:36.731
- Why'd you do it?

01:06:38.833 --> 01:06:42.471
I mean, you of all
fucking people.

01:06:45.207 --> 01:06:46.875
- I don't know.

01:06:46.875 --> 01:06:49.511
I just, I guess I just
wanted a good story.

01:06:53.915 --> 01:06:54.949
- Open the bag.

01:07:04.126 --> 01:07:04.959
- Fuck it.

01:07:06.828 --> 01:07:08.130
- The fuck you doing?

01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:09.631
- Getting loose, bitch.

01:07:12.434 --> 01:07:14.303
- You can't be serious.

01:07:14.303 --> 01:07:15.470
- Oh yeah, baby.

01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:16.771
You want a piece?

01:07:16.771 --> 01:07:18.840
You think you can hold hot fire?

01:07:20.875 --> 01:07:23.345
- Dude, you're fucking
hysterical right now.

01:07:25.347 --> 01:07:27.149
I kind of don't even
want to kill you anymore.

01:07:27.149 --> 01:07:28.917
- Darcie's been cheating
on you, by the way.

01:07:28.917 --> 01:07:30.252
- Oh, Darcie?

01:07:32.687 --> 01:07:34.223
I have a hundred Darcies.

01:07:34.223 --> 01:07:36.791
- You'll care when she
gets the blood work back.

01:07:36.791 --> 01:07:37.626
- Okay.

01:07:39.128 --> 01:07:42.797
This is gonna be fun
for me, not for you.

01:07:42.797 --> 01:07:45.734
You are about to have a
very bad night, friend.

01:08:28.743 --> 01:08:30.845
That's all you got, isn't it?

01:08:30.845 --> 01:08:31.846
- No.

01:08:41.256 --> 01:08:42.857
- Darcie has herpes,
you piece of shit!

01:08:42.857 --> 01:08:44.859
- Stop saying that!

01:08:44.859 --> 01:08:46.528
- She's got everything.

01:08:46.528 --> 01:08:48.797
Real white trash
buffet down there.

01:08:58.039 --> 01:09:00.342
- Steal from me, you fuck!

01:09:00.342 --> 01:09:01.543
I lost my dad too, Andy.

01:09:01.543 --> 01:09:03.945
You don't see me
crying about it.

01:09:03.945 --> 01:09:05.013
You go to work, you sack up,

01:09:07.482 --> 01:09:09.251
you do your job
like a fucking man.

01:09:14.256 --> 01:09:15.357
Christ.

01:09:15.357 --> 01:09:16.658
A luggage lock?

01:09:17.759 --> 01:09:18.593
- Protection.

01:09:19.794 --> 01:09:22.564
You'll regret not
using some with Darcie.

01:09:22.564 --> 01:09:24.399
- Stop saying that!

01:09:24.399 --> 01:09:26.335
She doesn't have diseases.

01:09:26.335 --> 01:09:27.536
- Yes, she does.

01:09:29.538 --> 01:09:31.940
- You're a fucking nobody, Andy!

01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:33.375
A fucking nobody!

01:09:34.809 --> 01:09:36.411
Give me the key.

01:09:36.411 --> 01:09:37.246
Come on.

01:09:38.447 --> 01:09:39.481
Give me the key, Andy.

01:09:39.481 --> 01:09:40.682
I'm done playing around.

01:09:46.488 --> 01:09:48.857
You're a fucking nobody, Andy.

01:09:48.857 --> 01:09:50.292
A fucking nobody!

01:10:22.924 --> 01:10:25.360
You don't have the balls, Andy.

01:10:32.701 --> 01:10:33.968
Me on the other hand.

01:10:42.777 --> 01:10:44.346
I hope it was worth it.

01:11:07.702 --> 01:11:10.305
- You still think I'm a nobody?

01:11:11.239 --> 01:11:12.407
- Oh, you fat-

01:11:22.617 --> 01:11:23.452
- Andy!

01:11:34.963 --> 01:11:37.065
* Born a worm

01:11:37.065 --> 01:11:39.468
* Spins a cocoon

01:11:39.468 --> 01:11:41.836
* Goes to sleep

01:11:41.836 --> 01:11:43.605
* Wakes up a butterfly

01:11:43.605 --> 01:11:48.610
* Oh what the fuck
is that about *

01:11:49.544 --> 01:11:51.212
* What the fuck is that about

01:11:54.015 --> 01:11:56.117
* Born a worm

01:11:56.117 --> 01:11:58.653
* Spins a cocoon

01:11:58.653 --> 01:12:00.955
* Goes to sleep

01:12:00.955 --> 01:12:02.791
* Wakes up a butterfly

01:12:02.791 --> 01:12:07.796
* Oh what the fuck
is that about *

01:12:08.697 --> 01:12:13.201
* What the fuck is that about

01:12:13.201 --> 01:12:15.637
* Born a worm

01:12:15.637 --> 01:12:18.139
* Spins a cocoon

01:12:18.139 --> 01:12:20.308
* Goes to sleep

01:12:20.308 --> 01:12:22.243
* Wakes up a butterfly

01:12:22.243 --> 01:12:27.248
* Oh what the fuck
is that about *

01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:31.620
* What the fuck is that about

01:12:39.994 --> 01:12:41.229
- You
know, if they think

01:12:41.229 --> 01:12:42.330
we're gonna look past
this bullying incident,

01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:43.898
they have another thing coming.

01:12:45.467 --> 01:12:48.102
I wasn't PTA president for
three years for nothing.

01:12:50.138 --> 01:12:52.373
You know, maybe I should
run for superintendent.

01:12:52.373 --> 01:12:53.542
That'll teach them just.

01:12:56.244 --> 01:12:57.111
Just in time.

01:12:57.111 --> 01:12:58.513
Come, come sit.

01:12:59.414 --> 01:13:02.383
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

01:13:02.383 --> 01:13:03.284
Come on.

01:13:03.284 --> 01:13:04.318
You look better.

01:13:04.318 --> 01:13:05.186
- Thank you.

01:13:05.186 --> 01:13:06.488
- You feeling good?

01:13:06.488 --> 01:13:07.522
Eat, eat.

01:13:07.522 --> 01:13:08.356
Come on.

01:13:10.324 --> 01:13:11.493
Okay.

01:13:11.493 --> 01:13:13.828
Because there is
dignity in every job.

01:13:13.828 --> 01:13:15.063
So I told them, I said,

01:13:15.063 --> 01:13:16.197
"Andres, you need to
get back out there

01:13:16.197 --> 01:13:17.732
and just do something better.

01:13:17.732 --> 01:13:20.234
I'm so tired of
you sulking around.

01:13:20.234 --> 01:13:23.672
I said, "You will not be a
bad example for my children.

01:13:23.672 --> 01:13:24.906
I won't have it."

01:13:24.906 --> 01:13:25.807
- Well, thank you-

01:13:28.577 --> 01:13:30.912
- I know this
is about his self-worth,

01:13:30.912 --> 01:13:32.146
and I know how important

01:13:32.146 --> 01:13:34.182
it is for a man to
be self-sufficient.

01:13:34.182 --> 01:13:35.484
He's such a good man.

01:13:50.565 --> 01:13:52.066
How are you feeling, sweetheart?

01:13:52.066 --> 01:13:53.935
I'm sorry we could only
use what we had here.

01:13:53.935 --> 01:13:55.436
- Yeah, sore but better.

01:13:55.436 --> 01:13:56.905
Thank you.

01:13:56.905 --> 01:13:58.172
- I can't believe they
just jumped you like that

01:13:58.172 --> 01:13:59.474
while you were moving
into your new home.

01:13:59.474 --> 01:14:01.075
- Yeah, this
came outta nowhere.

01:14:02.511 --> 01:14:05.146
- Santa Monica's supposed to
be a safe and quiet place.

01:14:05.146 --> 01:14:07.448
I mean, I can't believe it.

01:14:07.448 --> 01:14:08.783
- I know.

01:14:08.783 --> 01:14:10.384
Bad people everywhere, I guess.

01:14:10.384 --> 01:14:11.319
- Ugh, this world.

01:14:11.319 --> 01:14:12.253
That's so true.

01:14:14.989 --> 01:14:16.691
I'm gonna need you
to finish that.

01:15:00.569 --> 01:15:02.336
- Hey, are you all right, buddy?

01:15:02.336 --> 01:15:03.171
- Yeah.

01:15:04.573 --> 01:15:07.809
This yard sale and old ladies
get aggressive, you know?

01:15:11.012 --> 01:15:12.480
- I guess.

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:15.283
- You mind taking me to
the ocean at the PCH there?

01:15:15.283 --> 01:15:16.585
- Yeah.

01:15:16.585 --> 01:15:17.819
- Thanks, man.

01:15:46.715 --> 01:15:48.216
- Andres!

01:15:49.951 --> 01:15:50.785
Oh my God!

01:15:50.785 --> 01:15:52.520
Oh my God, oh my God!

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:53.655
Oh my God!

01:15:53.655 --> 01:15:54.488
Andres!

01:15:57.358 --> 01:15:58.960
Who is Mel and Joy?

01:16:00.629 --> 01:16:01.863
I mean...

01:16:05.499 --> 01:16:06.334
What?

01:16:34.996 --> 01:16:35.830
- Hello?

01:16:37.031 --> 01:16:37.866
Dead?

01:16:38.933 --> 01:16:39.768
LA, huh?

01:16:40.802 --> 01:16:41.803
We must have missed-

01:16:42.671 --> 01:16:43.604
Christ.

01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:47.709
- Just push it in.

01:16:47.709 --> 01:16:48.509
- Okay.

01:16:48.509 --> 01:16:49.343
Christ, man.

01:16:50.411 --> 01:16:51.212
It's time to go.

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:54.015
Shifflett's dead.

01:16:54.015 --> 01:16:55.183
- What?

01:16:55.183 --> 01:16:56.450
How?

01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:58.352
- He got blown up
by a goddamn bomb.

01:16:58.352 --> 01:17:00.088
- Jesus.

01:17:00.088 --> 01:17:00.855
Where?

01:17:00.855 --> 01:17:01.690
- In LA.

01:17:05.326 --> 01:17:07.195
- So...

01:17:07.195 --> 01:17:08.429
- Yeah.

01:17:08.429 --> 01:17:10.464
- We blew it.

01:17:16.237 --> 01:17:17.939
- Fuck it, let's grab a beer.

01:17:46.434 --> 01:17:48.036
- Happy birthday, Pop.

01:18:10.558 --> 01:18:11.492
- Stacy.

01:18:11.492 --> 01:18:12.326
- Yes.

01:18:16.998 --> 01:18:18.199
- I loved it.

01:18:18.199 --> 01:18:19.033
- Thank you.

01:18:19.033 --> 01:18:19.968
- Are you sure?

01:18:19.968 --> 01:18:21.202
- I said I loved it.

01:18:24.005 --> 01:18:25.339
I loved every page.

01:18:26.374 --> 01:18:28.309
I also lost my father this year,

01:18:28.309 --> 01:18:31.145
and I think yours would
appreciate the tribute.

01:18:32.213 --> 01:18:33.347
Thank you, Farrah.

01:18:34.448 --> 01:18:36.184
- We'll be in touch.
- Okay.

01:18:41.055 --> 01:18:45.626
- You know, you're gonna have
to write a sequel, right?

01:18:54.335 --> 01:18:57.138
- Your
attention, please.

01:19:14.488 --> 01:19:18.559
* I want the whole thing

01:19:18.559 --> 01:19:23.164
* The big life, the brass ring

01:19:23.164 --> 01:19:26.801
* Give me the good stuff

01:19:26.801 --> 01:19:31.439
* That's what I want more of

01:19:31.439 --> 01:19:35.476
* That's what I want

01:19:35.476 --> 01:19:39.848
* I won't sleep till
that's what I've got *

01:19:39.848 --> 01:19:44.853
* The whole wide
world in my hands *

01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:49.690
* That's what I want

01:19:58.199 --> 01:20:02.403
* I want to bring it

01:20:02.403 --> 01:20:06.941
* To take names and win it

01:20:06.941 --> 01:20:10.611
* I'll go till I'm done

01:20:10.611 --> 01:20:14.983
* Till I get what I want

01:20:14.983 --> 01:20:19.153
* That's what I want

01:20:19.153 --> 01:20:23.457
* I won't sleep till
that's what I've got *

01:20:23.457 --> 01:20:28.462
* The whole wide
world in my hands *

01:20:30.198 --> 01:20:33.067
* That's what I want

01:20:33.067 --> 01:20:37.205
* I can't sleep, I can't talk

01:20:37.205 --> 01:20:41.475
* I can't stop until
I have it all *

01:20:58.792 --> 01:21:02.763
* That's what I want

01:21:02.763 --> 01:21:07.135
* I won't sleep till
that's what I've got *

01:21:07.135 --> 01:21:12.140
* The whole wide
world in my hands *

01:21:13.975 --> 01:21:17.645
* That's what I want

01:21:34.929 --> 01:21:39.934
* Feel like I'm strapped
to a rocketship *

01:21:41.069 --> 01:21:46.074
* It wasn't built for me

01:21:46.941 --> 01:21:50.278
* I wasn't made for it

01:21:50.278 --> 01:21:53.347
* And so the questions is

01:21:53.347 --> 01:21:57.885
* Where will that lead

01:21:57.885 --> 01:22:02.790
* Stay right back here

01:22:05.926 --> 01:22:09.863
* I'm not moving here,
I'm not falling behind *

01:22:09.863 --> 01:22:12.400
* The midrange

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.035
* I'm not struggling here

01:22:14.035 --> 01:22:15.936
* I'm not falling behind

01:22:15.936 --> 01:22:18.306
* The midrange

01:22:18.306 --> 01:22:22.910
* I'm moving too,
just in the midrange *

01:22:34.355 --> 01:22:39.360
* The midrange, pulling
back, scale down *

01:22:40.594 --> 01:22:45.599
* The midrange, launch
forward, fast and down *
