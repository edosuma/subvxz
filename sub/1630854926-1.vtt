WEBVTT

00:34.655 --> 00:36.517
Where were the first
Christmas cards printed?

00:36.586 --> 00:39.448
Where's...
Was it New Zealand?

00:39.482 --> 00:41.275
Hmm. Terrance?

00:41.310 --> 00:43.724
Terrance, we only have a minute.
Where are you?

00:43.724 --> 00:44.758
Sorry.

00:46.310 --> 00:48.310
Those two, they've been trying
to steal our crown

00:48.344 --> 00:50.724
from the past two years,
but it's gonna take

00:50.758 --> 00:53.103
a Christmas miracle, Shavonna.

00:53.137 --> 00:54.620
Uh... Babe.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.620
We need to talk.

00:56.655 --> 00:57.482
What's up?

00:57.517 --> 00:59.758
You want to talk about
the answer?

00:59.793 --> 01:00.793
No. No.

01:01.689 --> 01:03.344
London.

01:03.379 --> 01:06.172
London! Christmas!
London...

01:06.206 --> 01:07.517
-No, no.
-London.

01:07.551 --> 01:09.793
Say, hey, babe,
that's not what I'm saying.

01:11.241 --> 01:12.793
I'm moving to London.

01:18.862 --> 01:19.793
Outside.

01:27.689 --> 01:28.689
London?

01:30.517 --> 01:31.931
Yeah.

01:31.931 --> 01:34.517
I mean, I know I've been going
back and forth for the board,

01:34.551 --> 01:36.620
but today they finally made
a counter-offer.

01:37.793 --> 01:39.793
Must've been good.

01:39.827 --> 01:41.172
Damn good.

01:42.378 --> 01:44.344
I'm gonna do it though.

01:44.378 --> 01:46.448
I'm gonna head up their
new offices in London.

01:48.206 --> 01:49.620
That's fantastic.

01:51.723 --> 01:53.172
Hmm-hm.

01:53.206 --> 01:55.275
I'm really proud of you, babe.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.344
Thank you.

01:58.378 --> 02:00.758
It's about time they
recognize your brilliance.

02:02.241 --> 02:03.793
Yeah.

02:03.862 --> 02:05.862
Six months apart is...

02:05.896 --> 02:06.896
long time.

02:06.931 --> 02:09.482
Yeah, but, um...

02:09.550 --> 02:11.551
I mean, we can manage.

02:11.586 --> 02:12.758
I mean, come on.

02:12.827 --> 02:14.896
We've done a whole summer
apart before. I mean...

02:14.931 --> 02:18.241
Yeah, but that's when you went
to your aunt in Dallas,

02:18.275 --> 02:20.241
we were eight and not a couple.

02:21.517 --> 02:22.896
True.

02:22.931 --> 02:24.758
Okay, what about the spring?

02:24.793 --> 02:27.586
I mean, I hear Janet will be
on tour. Control...

02:27.620 --> 02:30.413
Don't bring Janet into this.

02:31.862 --> 02:33.586
This is going to be hard.

02:33.620 --> 02:36.482
I mean, that's, that's our
busiest time of the year...

02:36.551 --> 02:37.793
All right, all right.

02:37.862 --> 02:39.620
Summer then?

02:39.655 --> 02:41.344
You'll come visit me now, right?

02:42.275 --> 02:44.896
I don't know.

02:44.930 --> 02:48.310
I just got this new position.

02:48.379 --> 02:50.482
With our summer releases,
campaigns,

02:50.551 --> 02:52.448
all eyes are on Ryse Publishing.

02:52.517 --> 02:53.724
So...

02:53.793 --> 02:56.793
And you know Sabrina has been
pulling me left and right...

02:56.862 --> 02:58.275
I-I know. I know.

02:58.310 --> 03:00.275
This new position is
what's gonna get me closer

03:00.310 --> 03:02.551
to my imprint, you know?

03:02.620 --> 03:04.793
-All of this is for...
-The dream. The dream.

03:04.793 --> 03:07.482
-I, I know. I got it.
-The dream.

03:07.517 --> 03:08.620
-Mm-hm.
-You're right.

03:08.655 --> 03:10.827
What do I always tell you?

03:10.862 --> 03:12.689
Oh.

03:12.724 --> 03:15.275
If God brought me to it,
he equipped me to do it.

03:15.275 --> 03:16.413
That's right.

03:17.517 --> 03:20.827
So, this is it for us.

03:20.862 --> 03:22.275
Yeah.

03:22.275 --> 03:23.827
You're doin' it, Noe.

03:25.965 --> 03:26.931
We're doin' it.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.724
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Chara Jackson,

03:41.793 --> 03:44.551
and this has been our interview
with one of Atlanta's

03:44.620 --> 03:50.275
rising stars in the world
of publishing, Noelle Tucker.

03:50.275 --> 03:52.827
So, final word.

03:52.862 --> 03:55.655
What is one thing that you would
tell our audience

03:55.689 --> 03:59.482
about setting goals
and fulfilling them?

03:59.517 --> 04:01.551
-Wow.
-Daddy.

04:01.586 --> 04:05.034
I guess I'd say
don't give up on them.

04:05.068 --> 04:07.344
Don't give up on you.

04:10.965 --> 04:12.931
You're gonna have obstacles
and distractions,

04:12.965 --> 04:16.551
but you also have everything
that you need to get through it.

04:16.586 --> 04:18.517
And, when things just
get a little crazy,

04:18.517 --> 04:20.000
you have to duck
and dodge a lil..

04:23.413 --> 04:26.931
My bad, girl!
We just were... Oh.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.896
Hi.

04:28.931 --> 04:32.000
We're just gonna step out
and make sure...

04:32.034 --> 04:34.724
-Get out!
-Oh! Sorry. Bye.

04:37.068 --> 04:38.724
It's not gonna be on camera,
is it?

04:38.758 --> 04:40.000
Eh, no.

04:43.068 --> 04:45.517
Sandra, you knew this was
a big deal.

04:45.517 --> 04:46.827
I've been trying to get
an interview with

04:46.827 --> 04:48.965
Atlanta's Rising Star
for months.

04:49.034 --> 04:50.551
If our newest client hadn't
tweeted about me,

04:50.586 --> 04:52.034
I probably still be on the
wait list.

04:52.068 --> 04:56.068
I know, and look, I kept David
Jr. quiet as long as could.

04:56.103 --> 04:58.689
Well, maybe next time if you
could take away any weapons,

04:58.724 --> 05:00.068
I'd really appreciate it.

05:00.103 --> 05:02.000
Next time?

05:02.034 --> 05:05.000
Hopefully you'll be doin'
interviews in your own home.

05:05.068 --> 05:07.000
Oh, that was subtle way of
telling me

05:07.068 --> 05:07.965
my stay is long overdue.

05:08.034 --> 05:10.620
No, of course not.
We love having you here.

05:10.655 --> 05:12.655
-You family.
-Right, right!

05:12.724 --> 05:14.793
Come on, now.

05:14.827 --> 05:17.068
Our home is your home.
You know that?

05:17.068 --> 05:18.931
Is it safe to come
to the kitchen now?

05:18.965 --> 05:20.655
-Ooh.
-Walk through my own home?

05:20.689 --> 05:22.793
Yes, babe.
Good morning.

05:22.827 --> 05:24.965
-Mmm. No, not today.
-You want some breakfast.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.482
I got to get to the office
early, but it looks great.

05:27.517 --> 05:29.137
-You look great.
-Whoa!

05:31.896 --> 05:35.689
-Good morning. David. Hi.
-Oh my!

05:35.758 --> 05:37.793
My interview went really well,
thank you for asking.

05:37.827 --> 05:40.413
Yeah. Until, David Jr. hit her
on the side of head with a toy.

05:41.965 --> 05:43.620
That's my guy! Oh!

05:43.655 --> 05:46.137
So, Noelle, uh,
my co-worker Hermin...

05:46.172 --> 05:48.517
Mm-mm. No. No.

05:48.586 --> 05:50.827
You don't even know
what I was gonna say.

05:50.862 --> 05:52.758
Is single. Saw a picture of me
on your desk,

05:52.758 --> 05:53.827
and wants to take me out
for dinner.

05:53.862 --> 05:56.068
Okay, so, you know exactly
what I was gonna say,

05:56.103 --> 05:57.655
but he could be the one.

05:57.689 --> 05:59.482
Look, you guys have
so much in common.

05:59.551 --> 06:02.172
Ah-huh. Like what?

06:02.206 --> 06:05.862
So, he has books,
you have books.

06:05.896 --> 06:08.137
He knows how to read, I'm
guessin' you know how to read.

06:08.137 --> 06:11.034
Look, this could be a match
made in heaven.

06:11.068 --> 06:13.862
-Indeed.
-D-d-don't "indeed" me, okay?

06:13.896 --> 06:17.172
Look, you're not putting in the
effort and somebody around here

06:17.206 --> 06:19.206
has to marry you off.

06:19.241 --> 06:20.379
And get me up out of your house?

06:20.413 --> 06:23.172
Babe, I-I didn't, I didn't say
it this time, she did.

06:23.206 --> 06:24.965
-You-you know...
-I know, babe. I know.

06:24.965 --> 06:26.896
-You did good.
-Thank you.

06:26.931 --> 06:28.896
You know,
I don't remember there being

06:28.965 --> 06:30.655
any complaints
after I moved into help

06:30.689 --> 06:32.034
my sister after her surgery.

06:32.068 --> 06:34.172
All that, you could go out
and earn a living

06:34.206 --> 06:35.689
to actually afford this house.

06:35.724 --> 06:38.137
And I thought that you had
moved in because

06:38.172 --> 06:40.172
they gentrified
your neighborhood.

06:40.206 --> 06:42.724
Yeah. And then they turned your
little studio into a condo,

06:42.758 --> 06:45.034
and they hiked up the rent,
and then I remember you sayin',

06:45.068 --> 06:48.206
"I wish they would," before you
moved into Casa Della Turner.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.965
-That's what--
-Okay, you two.

06:49.965 --> 06:51.172
'Cause she's bringin' up
old stuff...

06:51.206 --> 06:53.689
Hey, babe. It's okay.

06:53.724 --> 06:55.206
-I know. I know.
-She messed with me.

06:55.241 --> 06:57.034
You know what?

06:57.068 --> 07:01.034
Don't even worry. I'm up for
another promotion anyway.

07:01.034 --> 07:01.965
-Hm.
-Mm-hm.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.137
And I almost have enough
for my own place.

07:05.172 --> 07:08.586
So I'll be out of your little
mansion soon enough, Scrooge.

07:08.620 --> 07:11.103
There is no such
thing as a little mansion.

07:12.862 --> 07:15.724
I love you...

07:18.620 --> 07:20.137
I'mma deal with
y'all two later.

07:20.206 --> 07:21.103
Okay.

07:22.206 --> 07:23.586
All shook up.

07:23.620 --> 07:25.034
Keep-keep-keep talkin' to me.

07:26.931 --> 07:28.103
-Hey!
-Hey.

07:28.137 --> 07:29.586
How did the interview go?

07:29.620 --> 07:32.758
Well, surprisingly... great.

07:32.793 --> 07:35.241
Who would've thought that I'd be
that chick on the rise?

07:35.275 --> 07:38.137
Uh, me. I'm proud of you.

07:38.172 --> 07:41.793
Well, thank you
so much for staying up late

07:41.862 --> 07:43.586
and helping me prepare for it.

07:43.620 --> 07:46.000
You know I always got your back.

07:46.068 --> 07:48.137
Look, I was callin' to check in
and let you know that

07:48.206 --> 07:50.862
a brother's coming back
to States for Christmas.

07:52.517 --> 07:53.793
Hold on, wait.

07:53.862 --> 07:55.620
What? That's great.

07:55.689 --> 07:57.241
You know I gotta see my girl.

07:57.275 --> 07:59.206
Well, hey.
Your girl wants to be seen.

07:59.241 --> 08:00.896
I missed you for Thanksgiving.

08:00.896 --> 08:04.000
When do you get here?
Soon.

08:04.034 --> 08:06.655
I got a few more things
to wrap up over here, but, um,

08:06.689 --> 08:08.137
I'll call you
when I have more deets.

08:08.172 --> 08:10.931
Okay. Cool.
I'm gonna call you later, okay?

08:10.931 --> 08:13.206
-All right.
-Bye.

08:13.275 --> 08:15.137
Eh, hello?

08:17.827 --> 08:20.172
Shh! Shh! Shh! Don't! Shh!

08:20.206 --> 08:22.827
Uh, so, you got all of this
at the farmers' market?

08:22.862 --> 08:24.655
-I did.
-So then that chicken sausage.

08:24.689 --> 08:26.206
-But it smells like pork?
-Really?

08:26.275 --> 08:27.310
-Science.
-Hm...

08:29.689 --> 08:31.137
She made me do it. Love you!

08:31.172 --> 08:33.172
You deal with all of that.
Yep, yep, yep.

08:33.241 --> 08:35.620
Oh!

08:35.620 --> 08:38.206
-You two are ridiculous!
-No, you are.

08:38.275 --> 08:40.827
I can't believe you let that man
slip through your hands.

08:40.861 --> 08:43.620
I didn't let the man get away!
He just...

08:43.655 --> 08:44.862
It was a mutual decision.

08:44.931 --> 08:47.344
To let go of the love
of your life?

08:47.379 --> 08:48.965
To let go of my best friend,

08:48.965 --> 08:52.034
so he can pursue
his highest level of bliss.

08:52.103 --> 08:53.241
Boo!

08:55.344 --> 08:56.862
I gotta go.

09:06.827 --> 09:08.241
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

09:08.275 --> 09:10.758
Good morning, Maxine.
Thank you.

09:10.827 --> 09:12.827
Ah-huh. They finally called!

09:15.344 --> 09:18.275
Okay, it's the puck.
You did that today.

09:18.344 --> 09:22.344
Young man?
I know that better be a client.

09:22.379 --> 09:23.172
Yes.

09:25.793 --> 09:27.862
I read your notes
three times,

09:27.896 --> 09:29.724
and still doesn't make sense.

09:29.758 --> 09:32.344
So you want me to cut
a whole chapter?

09:32.379 --> 09:34.275
Yeah. Because it's redundant.

09:34.344 --> 09:37.206
It's like, you're repeating
beats to fill pages.

09:37.241 --> 09:39.931
-I was drivin' a point home.
-Mm-hm.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.206
You did drive a point home
in chapter six.

09:42.241 --> 09:44.344
Chapter six, it was fresh
and intriguing.

09:44.379 --> 09:47.068
Oh. So you found it intriguing.

09:47.103 --> 09:48.965
Do tell, young lady. Do tell.

09:49.034 --> 09:51.758
Well, people love
the idea of Carla

09:51.827 --> 09:53.379
falling in love.

09:53.413 --> 09:57.793
They love that cat and mouse
game between her and Eugene.

09:57.862 --> 10:00.241
But it really slows down
in chapter seven.

10:00.275 --> 10:04.241
You know, it's, it's time for
him to man up, stake his claim.

10:04.275 --> 10:08.034
Get his woman. Dragging on
so long makes it more about him

10:08.068 --> 10:09.241
than her.

10:10.344 --> 10:12.379
Wow, you really get him.

10:12.413 --> 10:15.241
Mm. I really think I get her.

10:15.275 --> 10:19.241
And we already have two books.
So, trust me.

10:19.275 --> 10:21.241
No, I do. I promise.

10:23.827 --> 10:25.000
Hey, uh...

10:26.379 --> 10:27.379
Noelle, so...

10:28.620 --> 10:32.931
Oh, hi. Deliveries all go
to the receptionist, please.

10:32.965 --> 10:36.034
Uh, yeah, but this is
a special delivery.

10:38.413 --> 10:39.896
Oh, my God! Terry!

10:41.206 --> 10:42.137
Oh!

10:43.068 --> 10:46.241
Mmm-mm!

10:47.827 --> 10:49.896
I thought you were gonna
come next week.

10:49.931 --> 10:52.931
You know, I thought I'd drop in
and surprise everyone.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.034
Mm-hm.

10:54.068 --> 10:58.103
-Besides, I brought some gifts.
-Uh-uh.

10:58.137 --> 11:01.310
Oh, my gosh! These are your
mama's sweet potato cookies?

11:01.344 --> 11:04.448
-You already know.
-Oh, my God! You're awful!

11:04.482 --> 11:06.310
You know I'm on my holiday diet.

11:06.344 --> 11:10.103
For what? Besides, since when do
you turn down free food?

11:10.137 --> 11:12.103
Listen, I had to get me your
plate at your house,

11:12.137 --> 11:13.344
and in the neighbors house.

11:13.413 --> 11:14.379
Yeah,
but why do you...

11:15.482 --> 11:17.758
Oh, I am so, so sorry!

11:17.793 --> 11:20.310
Terrance,
this is Vincent Downing.

11:20.344 --> 11:23.413
Author of New York Times
bestselling series

11:23.413 --> 11:24.896
Close Are The Waves.

11:24.896 --> 11:26.413
Yeah, yeah. Wow, man.

11:26.448 --> 11:28.448
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too, bruh.

11:28.482 --> 11:30.379
Uh, thanks for helping my girl
get that interview...

11:30.413 --> 11:31.896
Ah. No problem.

11:31.896 --> 11:34.379
My mom loves your books, bruh.

11:35.517 --> 11:37.793
-His momloves my books.
-Ah-huh.

11:37.827 --> 11:40.275
She's our target audience.

11:40.310 --> 11:43.206
And you will love it too
once your take my notes.

11:43.965 --> 11:44.931
Thanks.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.448
Nice meeting you too, man.

11:47.482 --> 11:49.310
-And, you too. All right.
-All right.

11:49.344 --> 11:51.655
-I'll see you later.
-Yeah.

11:52.482 --> 11:53.827
Okay. Sit, sit, sit!

11:55.241 --> 11:56.413
Tell me. Tell me.

11:56.448 --> 11:58.103
How was London?
How was your flight?

11:58.137 --> 12:00.000
-How was the presentation?
-Oh, come on.

12:00.068 --> 12:02.137
You know your boy killed it.

12:02.137 --> 12:03.793
Shoot! I could start
two tech companies

12:03.793 --> 12:05.517
with all the juice in that room.

12:05.551 --> 12:08.517
But I'm telling you,
this new app we're developing,

12:08.551 --> 12:10.000
it's gonna be a game changer.

12:11.137 --> 12:12.482
Okay. I know it will.

12:12.517 --> 12:15.000
-I'm so proud of you!
-Thank you.

12:16.448 --> 12:17.482
So, what's up?

12:17.517 --> 12:20.068
How's-how's the fam?
How's mom?

12:20.103 --> 12:22.827
Well, you know,
Sandra and Dave, they're great.

12:22.862 --> 12:24.448
But not really enjoying
my company.

12:26.206 --> 12:28.379
And mama's about to go
on her annual Christmas cruise

12:28.413 --> 12:30.000
with my auntie, without us.

12:30.034 --> 12:31.862
So she's... good.

12:31.896 --> 12:33.172
Yeah, mom's gettin' her
groove back.

12:33.206 --> 12:35.172
Okay, no.
We don't talk about that.

12:38.517 --> 12:40.172
So, um, how about you?

12:41.482 --> 12:43.482
What's new?

12:43.517 --> 12:45.068
Reading the next
great American novel,

12:45.137 --> 12:46.344
or helpin' to write it?

12:46.379 --> 12:49.068
Oh. Mm-mm.

12:49.137 --> 12:51.379
These, these are all Vincent's.

12:52.965 --> 12:55.206
I'm just his support system.

12:55.241 --> 12:57.344
But seeing you is the
"pick me up" that I needed.

12:59.413 --> 13:01.344
I'm glad I could put a smile
on your face.

13:03.103 --> 13:04.931
I missed you, Noe.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.896
Uh...

13:08.931 --> 13:10.413
Sorry, one sec.

13:12.586 --> 13:13.862
Oh. Yeah, yeah.

13:13.862 --> 13:16.310
Um, look, I-I know you're busy.

13:16.379 --> 13:19.551
So, I'm gonna get outta here,
but, um,

13:19.586 --> 13:22.241
I just wanted to stop by and see
what you were doin' tonight.

13:22.275 --> 13:23.482
Mm, I don't have any plans.

13:23.551 --> 13:25.068
Wait. Are you trying to

13:25.103 --> 13:26.620
take me to the Kris Kringle
Karaoke thing?

13:26.655 --> 13:29.482
Uh, no. No, no, no. Because
once your hit that stage,

13:29.551 --> 13:31.931
there will be nothin' silent
or holy about that night.

13:31.965 --> 13:33.103
Excuse you!

13:35.517 --> 13:37.068
Let's do dinner.

13:37.103 --> 13:39.241
-Say 8:00?
-Yeah.

13:39.275 --> 13:42.379
-That sounds great.
-All right.

13:42.379 --> 13:43.586
We got a lot
of catchin' up to do.

13:43.620 --> 13:45.103
-Yeah, we do.
-Yeah.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.517
It's so good to see you.

13:52.551 --> 13:54.344
I'll text you the deets later.

13:55.482 --> 13:57.068
-Sounds good.
-All right.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.482
Thank you for all my gifts,
my goodies.

13:59.551 --> 14:00.586
Oh, come on now. Anytime.

14:00.620 --> 14:02.172
You're just trying to
get me thick.

14:02.206 --> 14:04.482
Ah, listen, you already
got that down thick.

14:05.655 --> 14:07.448
-I'll see you later.
-Bye.

14:07.482 --> 14:08.482
All right.

14:28.206 --> 14:31.310
Whoever that was, sign him.
He is fine.

14:31.344 --> 14:34.586
His picture alone will have
books flying off the shelves.

14:34.586 --> 14:37.137
That's just Terrance.

14:37.172 --> 14:39.310
Best friend turned ex
turned best friend again?

14:39.344 --> 14:40.965
He looks better than
you described.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.310
London was definitely
good to him. Huh.

14:44.344 --> 14:46.448
Well, he brought me some
of his mama's famous cookies.

14:46.448 --> 14:49.137
Ah, I still have to get into
my designer couture dress

14:49.172 --> 14:50.620
for my annual holiday party.

14:50.655 --> 14:52.655
-No, thank you.
-Right.

14:52.689 --> 14:54.172
Noelle,
I can't thank you enough

14:54.206 --> 14:55.344
for helping to coordinate my
party this year.

14:55.379 --> 14:57.620
I know it's not a part of your
job description, but...

14:57.620 --> 14:59.517
Are you kidding me?
To have the who's who

14:59.551 --> 15:01.689
of the publishing world
along with Atlanta's most

15:01.724 --> 15:06.000
successful black men and women
all under one roof...

15:06.000 --> 15:09.448
Yes, please!
I am so, so honored that you

15:09.517 --> 15:11.172
selected me to help you
this year.

15:11.172 --> 15:13.275
Well, you know how I like to
nurture our company's

15:13.344 --> 15:15.034
biggest and brightest.

15:15.034 --> 15:17.655
And you were the only one in
town with no Christmas plan, so.

15:17.689 --> 15:19.517
Win-win for all.

15:19.551 --> 15:21.379
Right.

15:21.413 --> 15:25.172
Yes, ma'am.
I'll take what I can. Um...

15:25.172 --> 15:27.103
Sabrina.

15:27.172 --> 15:29.344
This party is going to be epic!

15:29.344 --> 15:32.344
-The guest list is crazy.
-Hm.

15:32.344 --> 15:36.103
I also heard, uh, Richard
from Davenrow and Dale Law

15:36.172 --> 15:37.310
will be there.

15:38.413 --> 15:42.068
So? Why are you looking at...

15:42.103 --> 15:43.689
Don't think I didn't notice
the chemistry between you two.

15:43.724 --> 15:48.206
Especially at last month's
publisher's retreat. Okay?

15:48.241 --> 15:49.586
You looked like you were
looking for little bit

15:49.655 --> 15:50.655
more than legal advice.

15:50.689 --> 15:52.551
I've known Richard forever.

15:52.586 --> 15:54.586
His firm used to rep me
back in the day.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.586
And he just had a fresh divorce.

15:56.620 --> 15:59.724
Not my idea of a
romantic prospect.

15:59.758 --> 16:01.620
He's been divorced
for two years.

16:02.655 --> 16:04.758
I do my research.

16:04.758 --> 16:07.137
My dear, you are focused
on the wrong kind of hook-up.

16:07.172 --> 16:08.827
This is gonna be social.

16:08.862 --> 16:11.310
But I've invited some of the
hottest up-and-coming writers.

16:11.344 --> 16:14.448
A room full of
potential acquisitions.

16:14.482 --> 16:17.241
Perfect mixture,
new money, old money.

16:17.241 --> 16:19.413
And most importantly, my money.

16:21.344 --> 16:24.275
-And your friends.
-Oh. Right.

16:24.310 --> 16:26.275
-Ah-huh.
-Them too.

16:26.310 --> 16:28.620
So, do you want to get together
and review the guest list

16:28.655 --> 16:30.137
again tonight?

16:30.172 --> 16:31.655
Mm-mm. I can't.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.275
I have plans.

16:33.310 --> 16:36.034
Well, I hope it's a date
with that fine Terrance.

16:37.172 --> 16:39.310
Hm. We're just friends.

16:39.344 --> 16:40.827
All I know is,

16:40.862 --> 16:43.689
any man who wants
to be just friends...

16:43.758 --> 16:46.724
doesn't stop by
when he can just call.

16:48.517 --> 16:50.551
It is not a date,
Sabrina.

16:51.827 --> 16:53.448
Okay.

16:58.137 --> 16:59.448
Or is it?

16:59.482 --> 17:01.862
Okay, so, you got decide
if you want to look like

17:01.896 --> 17:05.172
chestnuts roasting
on an open fire, or mistletoe.

17:05.205 --> 17:06.344
What you feelin'?

17:06.378 --> 17:08.241
-Chestnuts? Mistletoe?
-God!

17:08.310 --> 17:11.517
This is totally a date.
Look at me. I'm so nervous.

17:11.550 --> 17:13.723
-I can't stop shaking.
-Why you nervous?

17:13.758 --> 17:16.655
I mean, yeah, it's the first
time you've seen each other

17:16.655 --> 17:19.723
in almost a year,
but he's your buddy.

17:19.758 --> 17:23.310
-Your pal. Your friend.
-Yeah. I don't know, Sandra.

17:23.310 --> 17:24.792
Okay? Everything was fine...
At least I thought

17:24.827 --> 17:26.862
everything was fine.

17:26.896 --> 17:28.758
I'm thriving, he's thriving.
You know? But then,

17:28.827 --> 17:31.379
I saw him, and a whole bunch of
feelings that I had...

17:31.413 --> 17:33.344
-Did he smell good?
-So good.

17:33.379 --> 17:36.482
Oh! Girl, that'd do it.

17:36.482 --> 17:39.586
Oh. It's just that he has his
whole new swag. You know?

17:39.655 --> 17:41.827
And then he asked me to
go to dinner with him tonight.

17:41.827 --> 17:44.586
I swear I heard something
in his voice.

17:44.655 --> 17:46.862
What if he asked me to go back
to London with him again?

17:46.896 --> 17:49.344
I say, don't make the same
mistake twice.

17:51.793 --> 17:53.862
What am I gonna do, mare?

17:53.896 --> 17:56.689
Now, if you go with mistletoe,
you can put this hair here,

17:56.724 --> 17:58.586
and then you already ready
for the come in.

17:58.655 --> 18:00.620
You know what I'm sayin'?
You know what I'm sayin...

18:00.689 --> 18:01.896
Girl!

18:12.862 --> 18:14.724
-Hi.
-Hi.

18:15.965 --> 18:18.793
Wow. You, ah, look amazing.

18:18.862 --> 18:20.344
Oh. I do? Thank you.

18:21.448 --> 18:22.862
Thanks for coming.

18:28.655 --> 18:31.448
-Thanks for inviting me.
-No problem.

18:31.482 --> 18:33.241
Thanks for coming.

18:35.655 --> 18:37.517
You don't look too bad yourself.

18:38.344 --> 18:40.241
Thank you.

18:40.275 --> 18:41.931
Well, before we order, I--

18:41.965 --> 18:44.724
Actually, before you go on, can
I just say something real fast?

18:44.724 --> 18:47.758
-Okay, uh...
-Oh, hi. I'm so sorry.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.551
We're not ready to order yet.
Thank you.

18:50.551 --> 18:52.758
No. No, she's not the waitress.

18:56.379 --> 19:00.586
Noelle, this is my girlfriend.

19:00.586 --> 19:01.586
Hi.

19:02.655 --> 19:04.586
-Girlfriend?
-Yeah.

19:05.931 --> 19:08.655
You know, fun fact,
her name is Noelle too.

19:09.862 --> 19:11.931
She goes by Elle.

19:11.965 --> 19:13.827
Yeah. That's really crazy.

19:13.862 --> 19:16.620
-I'm a hugger.
-Okay!

19:17.827 --> 19:19.965
It's so nice to finally
meet you.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.896
I've heard so much about you.

19:21.965 --> 19:24.655
I hope you don't mind me
crashing your little reunion.

19:24.689 --> 19:27.344
-Oh, i-i-it's cool. Right, Noe?
-Mm-hm.

19:27.379 --> 19:28.965
It's totally cool.
Don't be silly.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.344
Sit!

19:35.034 --> 19:37.448
-It's hot.
-Ooh! Yeah.

19:37.448 --> 19:38.862
Everything all right?
Yeah.

19:43.448 --> 19:46.586
I love your dress.
She's so pretty, babe.

19:46.586 --> 19:47.586
Yeah.

19:49.793 --> 19:51.862
-No, he didn't!
-He did.

19:51.931 --> 19:54.620
How does she look?

19:54.620 --> 19:58.310
-I don't know. Ghastly.
-Ooh! That pretty, huh?

20:00.344 --> 20:01.620
What did I do to deserve this?

20:01.620 --> 20:04.965
I've been a good girl all year!

20:04.965 --> 20:06.965
Well, don't throw in
the towel yet.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Santa may still be
on your side.

20:09.034 --> 20:11.793
This could be a fling
or something. You don't know.

20:11.793 --> 20:15.413
Just go and enjoy dinner.
It won't be that bad.

20:19.931 --> 20:21.172
Please.

20:21.206 --> 20:23.827
You live 30 minutes
from each other all this time,

20:23.862 --> 20:27.482
but had to move half way
across the world...

20:27.517 --> 20:28.931
to find each other.

20:28.965 --> 20:31.689
-Crazy, right?
-So crazy.

20:31.724 --> 20:34.482
Would you believe
it took him an entire month

20:34.517 --> 20:36.482
to call me after the party?

20:36.517 --> 20:37.793
Playin' hard to get.

20:37.827 --> 20:39.896
But I had no choice
but to say yes,

20:39.965 --> 20:43.793
because who could say no
to a Janet Jackson concert?

20:43.827 --> 20:44.965
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
Did you say
Janet Jackson?

20:48.034 --> 20:51.620
You love Janet Jackson too?
She is my favorite.

20:51.620 --> 20:53.724
Have you ever seen her
perform live?

20:53.793 --> 20:57.620
No, but I'm a huge fan.
I mean, huge, huge!

20:57.655 --> 21:00.379
You know? I came close once.

21:01.689 --> 21:04.724
-I guess I missed my chance.
-That's awful.

21:04.758 --> 21:07.379
Mm-hm. Yeah. My best
friend took someone else.

21:07.413 --> 21:09.310
Oh, that's rude.

21:10.413 --> 21:12.344
I'd like to think so.

21:12.344 --> 21:14.241
What are your thoughts,
Terrance?

21:16.758 --> 21:21.103
Uh... I mean, no need in
dwelling in the past, right?

21:21.137 --> 21:23.586
I mean, where's the Christmas
spirit in that, Noelle?

21:25.896 --> 21:29.862
-So, Elle, are you still in PR?
-Oh, no.

21:29.896 --> 21:31.551
I'm an influencer now.

21:31.586 --> 21:34.000
I felt like I wanted me to do

21:34.034 --> 21:35.724
somethin' different
with my life.

21:35.758 --> 21:38.689
Influencer, em, Insta-model?

21:38.724 --> 21:40.551
-Come on, Noe.
-Oh.

21:40.586 --> 21:44.068
That's one aspect of it,
but it's so much more.

21:44.103 --> 21:45.551
I'm also an author.

21:45.586 --> 21:47.724
I like to encourage,
inspire women to get

21:47.758 --> 21:49.620
more out of their life
that they're livin'.

21:49.689 --> 21:52.000
-So you're a life coach, too?
-Mm-hm.

21:52.034 --> 21:54.827
-Influencer, life coach. Huh.
-Mm-hm.

21:54.827 --> 21:57.724
-Lucrative?
-Actually, yeah.

21:57.758 --> 21:59.551
I mean, Elle has thousands
of followers.

21:59.586 --> 22:02.000
She's just shy of a million.

22:02.068 --> 22:04.068
Babe, enough about me.

22:04.068 --> 22:07.413
So, Terrance tells me
you're also an editor.

22:07.413 --> 22:11.068
Mm-hm. Senior editor
at Ryse Publishing.

22:11.103 --> 22:12.551
Ryse?

22:12.551 --> 22:14.137
I love them.

22:14.172 --> 22:15.448
I self-published my first book,

22:15.482 --> 22:17.517
but I'm familiar
with the company.

22:17.586 --> 22:19.965
-Mm.
-Yeah. Maybe you've heard of it.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.068
The Art Of The Elevation,
Unlock and Unleash.

22:23.103 --> 22:25.448
Hmm? No.

22:25.482 --> 22:26.793
I don't think so.

22:27.551 --> 22:29.413
Never heard of it.

22:29.413 --> 22:31.931
-Huh.
-Uh-uh, you will.

22:31.965 --> 22:33.758
Seein' it's about
to be a best-seller.

22:33.793 --> 22:36.448
-Babe!
-Well, is that right?

22:37.172 --> 22:38.896
That's cute. Oh.

22:38.896 --> 22:40.448
You're in luck.

22:40.482 --> 22:43.724
I have a copy just for you.

22:46.896 --> 22:47.827
Oh.

22:48.965 --> 22:50.172
Wow!

22:50.172 --> 22:52.827
You walk around with autographed
copies of your book?

22:52.896 --> 22:55.103
For my man's best-friend,
of course.

22:55.137 --> 22:58.965
I mean, really, you're the only
thing he talks about.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.172
To be honest,
I'd probably be jealous

23:01.206 --> 23:02.482
if you weren't like his sister.

23:17.586 --> 23:20.862
-I hate her.
-Rightfully so.

23:20.896 --> 23:24.137
She goes by Elle.
Oh, her name is Noelle.

23:25.724 --> 23:27.689
He's literally dating me,
but not.

23:28.965 --> 23:31.068
It don't take a degree
in psychology to see

23:31.137 --> 23:33.586
how crazy this is.

23:33.655 --> 23:36.517
Eh, he's clearly still
in love with you.

23:37.206 --> 23:39.137
No, he's not.

23:39.137 --> 23:41.137
It's a coincidence.

23:41.172 --> 23:42.862
This is crazy.

23:42.896 --> 23:45.620
Like "TV movie thriller" crazy.

23:48.172 --> 23:49.862
It's over.

23:49.896 --> 23:51.724
It's official. He's moved on.

23:51.758 --> 23:54.103
It was official when you
broke up with him last year.

23:55.517 --> 23:57.000
That was mutual.

23:58.206 --> 24:00.068
So you did the right thing?

24:06.034 --> 24:07.689
I thought so.

24:10.241 --> 24:11.862
And I saw them together...

24:14.551 --> 24:17.551
I just thought that
when the time was right,

24:17.551 --> 24:19.206
when both of our
careers settled...

24:19.206 --> 24:21.172
That he was ready then?

24:23.103 --> 24:25.000
You took a gamble, sis.

24:28.586 --> 24:29.758
I know.

24:32.620 --> 24:35.034
I lost my, my man
and my best friend.

24:36.896 --> 24:39.206
This is gonna be the
worst Christmas ever!

24:39.241 --> 24:41.068
Nah.

24:41.103 --> 24:43.103
Not until she has a ring
on her finger,

24:43.137 --> 24:46.068
or a baby in the oven,
I say you fight.

24:47.103 --> 24:48.758
You want him back?

24:53.206 --> 24:54.758
Then go for it.

24:55.689 --> 24:57.793
She can't out-Noelle you.

24:57.827 --> 25:01.275
You're the real Noelle.
The OG Noelle.

25:01.310 --> 25:03.206
The first Neolle.

25:03.275 --> 25:06.620
It's time to put No-Elle
in her place.

25:11.344 --> 25:13.000
Maybe you're right.

25:15.034 --> 25:17.689
Maybe him dating this fake
Noelle is a call for help.

25:17.758 --> 25:19.965
SOS. You heard?

25:20.000 --> 25:22.137
I say, we stuff-up a chimney,

25:22.172 --> 25:24.241
and send her packin'
on a reindeer.

25:28.655 --> 25:31.034
-You're bad.
-I know!

25:31.103 --> 25:34.275
They mess with my
baby sister.

25:34.310 --> 25:36.000
I can't have that. Come here.

25:36.034 --> 25:36.965
Mmm.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.310
Now go get your man back.

25:45.655 --> 25:47.586
What is she talkin' about?

25:50.241 --> 25:51.620
So...

25:51.620 --> 25:53.310
how was your dinner
with Terrance?

25:53.344 --> 25:56.310
-Ah, fine.
-Oh.

25:56.344 --> 25:58.000
Until he introduced me
to his new girlfriend.

25:58.034 --> 26:00.034
Oh. From London?
Was she white?

26:00.103 --> 26:01.206
No.

26:01.241 --> 26:04.103
-She was a Noelle.
-You lost me.

26:04.137 --> 26:07.206
He's dating this new chick
named Elle Carter... Carper--

26:07.241 --> 26:10.379
W-wait. Elle Carver.
The Elle Carver?

26:10.413 --> 26:11.896
-I love her.
-Oh.

26:11.931 --> 26:15.068
-Her book changed my life.
-Really?

26:15.103 --> 26:17.344
Well, it isn't the Bible,
but the way she encourages women

26:17.379 --> 26:19.000
to unlock and unleash...

26:19.000 --> 26:20.206
Definitely the edge I needed to

26:20.241 --> 26:22.724
buy Miller And House
Publishing out.

26:22.758 --> 26:24.724
That's the gamble
that still pays.

26:24.758 --> 26:26.275
Wow. I guess
she's the real deal.

26:26.344 --> 26:29.862
"Recalibrate your mind to
focus more on your I cans

26:29.862 --> 26:32.206
and I wills,
rather than your I thinks

26:32.241 --> 26:33.862
and I wishes."

26:33.896 --> 26:35.206
Excuse me?

26:35.241 --> 26:36.896
It's in the book.

26:38.275 --> 26:41.275
Right. Just started glancing
over it this morning.

26:41.344 --> 26:43.034
Oh, it's a hit.

26:43.068 --> 26:45.344
Was on several
book club lists.

26:45.344 --> 26:48.206
She's an international brand.
And this is just the beginning.

26:48.241 --> 26:49.724
She's on the verge
of becoming a young Oprah

26:49.758 --> 26:51.862
and Iyanla all in one.

26:51.862 --> 26:53.413
I know she's from here,
relocated to London,

26:53.448 --> 26:56.103
but if she did something
States side...

26:56.172 --> 26:57.724
she'd dominate the
self-help market.

26:57.758 --> 27:01.413
-Dominate? Really?
-Yeah.

27:01.413 --> 27:03.413
Well, she did say something
about publishing a second book,

27:03.448 --> 27:08.241
and hiring an actual publishing
house to help her.

27:08.275 --> 27:10.000
Hm.

27:10.068 --> 27:11.482
Think I could bring her in?

27:11.517 --> 27:14.000
Oh, I'm sure she's meeting
with every major pub--

27:14.068 --> 27:17.448
Every major? We are standing
in every major.

27:17.482 --> 27:20.310
And you are every woman!

27:20.379 --> 27:22.103
And Ryse...

27:23.724 --> 27:24.793
needs women like her.

27:24.827 --> 27:27.344
Mm. I got chills.

27:27.413 --> 27:28.827
Noelle, this could be
the Christmas miracle

27:28.896 --> 27:30.482
you've been waiting for.

27:30.517 --> 27:33.344
You bring her on and I guarantee
you the board will be running

27:33.413 --> 27:35.206
to give you your own imprint.

27:36.896 --> 27:39.068
We sign her before
my big Christmas party,

27:39.068 --> 27:40.413
that promotion's
as good as yours.

27:56.275 --> 27:59.413
♪ This is why you can't go
Christmas caroling with us ♪♪

27:59.413 --> 28:01.862
Come on, baby. Let me, let me
put the sauce on it.

28:01.896 --> 28:03.862
-Mm-mm.
-Y'all-y'all need me.

28:03.896 --> 28:05.862
-Babe...
-You-you need me to lead this.

28:05.896 --> 28:07.896
Just sing the song
like everybody's sing...

28:07.965 --> 28:12.344
Wait a minute! Okay!

28:12.379 --> 28:14.413
Yep! That's the one.

28:14.482 --> 28:16.896
Huh!
What? Aahh!

28:16.965 --> 28:19.448
Yep! That's the one!

28:21.206 --> 28:23.379
-What's-what's the one?
-Tsk.

28:23.413 --> 28:25.000
That's my sister right there.

28:26.517 --> 28:28.137
Isn't your son somewhere crying?

28:28.137 --> 28:30.172
Isn't that your biological
clock ticking?

28:30.206 --> 28:32.034
-David!
-It's loud.

28:32.068 --> 28:35.103
She started it.
Why are you so dolled up?

28:36.586 --> 28:38.862
Ah... Do you have a date?

28:38.896 --> 28:40.379
Calm down.

28:40.413 --> 28:42.793
It's not a date... yet.

28:42.793 --> 28:45.034
This is for Terrance.

28:45.068 --> 28:47.103
Doesn't he have
a hot new girlfriend?

28:48.034 --> 28:49.482
You know I tell him everything.

28:49.517 --> 28:51.379
But nobody said "hot."

28:51.413 --> 28:53.827
Why are you dressed up
for him?

28:53.862 --> 28:55.206
She's winnin' him back.

28:55.241 --> 28:57.965
This girl is gonna have
that man in her stocking

28:57.965 --> 28:59.517
by Christmas Eve.

29:01.034 --> 29:02.896
-Leave it alone.
-I had him first.

29:02.931 --> 29:05.137
She has him now.
Leave it alone.

29:05.206 --> 29:07.931
-Why? He's mine.
-He doesn't seem to know it.

29:07.965 --> 29:10.206
Hence, the dress.

29:10.241 --> 29:12.310
So you're going
to manipulate him

29:12.379 --> 29:14.137
to falling back in love
with you?

29:14.172 --> 29:17.448
No. I've had him since jungle
gyms and hopscotch, so...

29:17.482 --> 29:20.241
And she's had his heart
since you dropped him,

29:20.275 --> 29:21.482
what, this time last year.

29:21.551 --> 29:25.931
It was a mutual break, David!

29:25.965 --> 29:28.241
-It's just a dress.
-It's just a dress.

29:28.275 --> 29:30.413
-She's the worst.
-She's so the worst.

29:30.448 --> 29:32.965
I thought she was a black
entrepreneur on the rise

29:33.000 --> 29:35.551
like yourself, and don't
you have the same name?

29:35.551 --> 29:38.344
Isn't it, what... Just like some
self-destruction type stuff.

29:38.344 --> 29:39.517
Ignore him.

29:39.551 --> 29:42.034
You look amazing.

29:42.034 --> 29:44.241
Maybe David's right.

29:44.275 --> 29:46.862
-What am I doing?
-Wait.

29:48.034 --> 29:49.896
Can you say that again
but slower?

29:49.931 --> 29:51.896
-I want to record it.
-Stop.

29:51.896 --> 29:54.241
The real question is,
what do you want?

30:04.482 --> 30:06.931
-Oh, hey.
-Wow!

30:06.965 --> 30:09.896
Uh, I'm sorry. I-I mean...

30:09.931 --> 30:11.275
Uh...

30:12.137 --> 30:12.931
Wow!

30:14.379 --> 30:16.448
-Thank you.
-No, thank you.

30:16.482 --> 30:19.034
Thanks.
Uh, see the dress works.

30:19.034 --> 30:20.517
Yes, ma'am.

30:21.517 --> 30:23.448
So, what's the occasion?

30:23.482 --> 30:26.379
Nothing. I just felt like,
um, you know, just...

30:28.103 --> 30:30.068
Wait. Do we have an appointment
that I missed?

30:30.103 --> 30:33.068
Oh. No. I just, stopping by
to see if you read

30:33.103 --> 30:34.206
my most recent draft.

30:34.206 --> 30:36.896
Oh. Yes. I started it.

30:36.931 --> 30:38.551
Not done yet.

30:38.551 --> 30:40.931
But it's in really,
really good shape.

30:42.275 --> 30:43.482
Thank you.

30:43.551 --> 30:46.068
You know, I couldn't have did it
without you.

30:46.103 --> 30:48.103
Your notes and your thoughts
on Eugene

30:48.137 --> 30:49.517
really opened this thing up
for me.

30:49.551 --> 30:51.551
Well, good.

30:51.586 --> 30:55.068
You know, him hiding behind
his job and emotions

30:55.103 --> 30:57.034
instead of pursuing Carla

30:57.034 --> 30:58.620
was the wake up call
I needed.

30:58.655 --> 31:01.448
Hm. Right?
That's wonderful.

31:01.482 --> 31:02.413
Noelle...

31:04.620 --> 31:06.586
I'd like to take you out.

31:11.413 --> 31:12.344
Um...

31:14.655 --> 31:16.241
Out?

31:19.620 --> 31:21.310
Vincent.

31:22.517 --> 31:25.482
Thank you.
I'm, I'm very flattered.

31:25.517 --> 31:28.862
But you're my client. You know?
Sabrina would never approve.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.517
She's your boss,
not your mama.

31:33.586 --> 31:35.965
I work here.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.655
Excuse me.

31:37.689 --> 31:40.000
-Oh. Sorry.
-Hm.

31:42.586 --> 31:43.931
So...

31:46.275 --> 31:48.275
You're saying no
because I'm a client?

31:48.310 --> 31:49.620
Yes.

31:49.655 --> 31:51.482
N-no.

31:51.517 --> 31:54.448
Wait. Wait. No. Yes.

31:57.448 --> 32:00.689
I just don't think
it's a good idea.

32:00.724 --> 32:03.517
To go to a little dinner?

32:03.551 --> 32:04.689
A movie?

32:04.724 --> 32:06.310
Cup of coffee?

32:07.758 --> 32:10.000
I just think that we should keep
things professional

32:10.034 --> 32:11.413
between these four walls.

32:12.758 --> 32:16.034
-Is that cool?
-Yeah. Cool.

32:16.068 --> 32:18.758
Whatever you want, Noelle.

32:18.793 --> 32:21.379
Looks like I have a lot of
writing to do anyway, right?

32:21.413 --> 32:22.413
Yeah.

32:29.655 --> 32:30.586
Oh.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.448
I'm so sorry.

32:33.517 --> 32:35.413
Do you think that we can
pick this up tomorrow?

32:36.482 --> 32:37.689
Oh, yeah.

32:37.724 --> 32:39.689
Tomorrow. Sure. Yeah.

32:39.724 --> 32:42.000
-Thank you so much for coming.
-Hey, no problem.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.689
-I'll talk to you...
-Tomorrow.

32:43.724 --> 32:45.586
-Tomorrow. Yeah.
-Yes.

32:47.724 --> 32:48.517
Yeah.

32:54.241 --> 32:55.206
Hey.

32:56.655 --> 32:58.000
Uh, yeah.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
It's good to hear from you too.

33:02.310 --> 33:04.655
I just want you to know
that I heard you,

33:04.724 --> 33:06.793
and I'm willing to try.

33:06.827 --> 33:08.586
I really want my
best friend back.

33:10.413 --> 33:11.758
Do you think that you can come
over to the office

33:11.793 --> 33:14.448
this afternoon so we can talk
some more about it?

33:15.586 --> 33:19.275
I'm doing a taste test for
Sabrina's annual Christmas party

33:19.310 --> 33:21.724
and Chef Jake is gonna be here
in the afternoon,

33:21.758 --> 33:23.103
so we could...

33:26.551 --> 33:27.758
Great!

33:27.793 --> 33:29.758
Great. It's great. Yeah.

33:29.793 --> 33:31.137
Cool. See you soon.

33:42.379 --> 33:43.655
Mmm.

33:43.724 --> 33:45.413
Chef Jake...

33:45.448 --> 33:47.137
this is amazing.

33:47.172 --> 33:49.275
That's coconut cobbler bite.
Wow!

33:49.310 --> 33:50.655
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

33:50.689 --> 33:52.310
It normally does leave
the ladies with a smile.

33:52.344 --> 33:54.068
But, uh, how's it for you,
my man?

33:54.068 --> 33:55.655
-It's all right.
-Okay.

33:55.689 --> 33:57.758
Well, maybe I'll do better
when you guys hire me

33:57.793 --> 33:59.758
to cater your wedding.

33:59.793 --> 34:01.827
Oh! Well, actually, we're, um...

34:02.827 --> 34:03.862
Mm-mm.

34:03.896 --> 34:05.689
We're not together.

34:05.724 --> 34:06.724
I'm single.

34:06.793 --> 34:09.379
Very single. And open.

34:09.413 --> 34:13.862
I don't... Not open, as in,
the bites, Chef Jake.

34:13.896 --> 34:16.655
Wait, wait.
You single in that dress?

34:18.551 --> 34:20.688
You know, I'm sorry. I hope
that wasn't too unprofessional.

34:20.724 --> 34:22.620
Very.

34:22.620 --> 34:24.172
No. That's fine.

34:24.206 --> 34:25.344
Thank you.

34:25.379 --> 34:27.516
It's nice to be appreciated.

34:27.551 --> 34:29.793
I should be apologizing to you,
the way I've been drooling

34:29.827 --> 34:32.034
over these crab puffs.

34:34.862 --> 34:36.379
And a man like you, single...

34:36.413 --> 34:38.379
cooking all of this.

34:38.413 --> 34:39.757
Yeah. It's rough out here
in these streets,

34:39.827 --> 34:41.516
but I've been a good boy
and hopefully

34:41.551 --> 34:42.688
Santa'll stuff
a little somethin',

34:42.724 --> 34:43.688
somethin' in my stocking
this year.

34:43.724 --> 34:45.241
Oh.

34:45.310 --> 34:47.896
-Or someone.
-Ah! I like that.

34:47.931 --> 34:50.344
Now I got to revise my letter
to the North Pole.

34:50.379 --> 34:51.413
How you spell your name again?

34:51.482 --> 34:54.206
Hey, you know...
Should I leave?

34:54.241 --> 34:55.551
Oh, Terrance, you're still here?

34:55.620 --> 34:56.724
Really?

34:56.793 --> 34:58.689
Tell you what. I'm gonna get you
guys some sample menu

34:58.724 --> 35:00.896
to finalize everything,
a few more samples.

35:00.931 --> 35:02.758
I'm just gonna run down
to my truck, okay?

35:02.793 --> 35:04.862
-Mm.
-All right? I'll be right back.

35:11.931 --> 35:12.862
What?

35:15.827 --> 35:18.448
And please, if anything comes
to mind, just let me know.

35:18.482 --> 35:20.793
Okay? 'Cause I can tweak,
twist and adjust the menu

35:20.827 --> 35:22.931
to whatever you like to
suit your personal needs.

35:22.965 --> 35:25.758
-Mm-hm. Thank you.
-Ah, no problem.

35:25.793 --> 35:27.724
-I will be calling you.
-Okay. All right.

35:27.724 --> 35:30.586
-Mm-hm. Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas to you too.

35:30.620 --> 35:32.413
-Feliz Navidad!
-Ha-Happy Hanukkah.

35:32.448 --> 35:34.689
-Oh. Happy Kwanzaa.
-Happy Kwanzaa to you too.

35:52.482 --> 35:53.689
What's up with you, Grinch?

35:56.896 --> 35:58.896
He was so busy flirting
with you that you didn't even

35:58.931 --> 36:01.793
finalize Sabrina's menu.

36:01.793 --> 36:03.758
It's okay. I can always call him
back down here.

36:05.379 --> 36:07.344
He's not even your type.

36:07.379 --> 36:09.172
And how would you know?

36:10.586 --> 36:12.344
First-hand knowledge.

36:15.517 --> 36:18.000
Well, maybe I'm ready
to try something new.

36:34.000 --> 36:35.586
Babe, really?

36:46.517 --> 36:48.379
I almost got a
residence in Thailand.

36:48.448 --> 36:50.689
That's why you did
get a residence in Chicago.

36:50.724 --> 36:52.827
-It's my love language.
-It was worth it.

36:55.862 --> 36:58.448
I guess he said no to the dress.
Got her. Didn't I?

36:58.448 --> 37:01.068
-No.
-Come on. Oh!

37:01.103 --> 37:02.379
-Go.
-Why do I have to go?

37:02.413 --> 37:04.862
Your mouth.

37:04.896 --> 37:07.344
You gonna
tell me anyway.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.724
What happened?

37:20.000 --> 37:21.103
Tell me everything.

37:21.137 --> 37:23.896
He said that he was thinking
about coming back home.

37:23.931 --> 37:25.551
Okay.

37:25.586 --> 37:27.620
And she's thinking about
coming back with him.

37:27.689 --> 37:30.689
And then, Sabrina told me that
she wants me to sign her,

37:30.689 --> 37:33.000
and if I do,
then I'll get promoted.

37:33.034 --> 37:34.862
Wow!

37:34.896 --> 37:35.896
So what do you want?

37:41.344 --> 37:43.827
-I want the promotion.
-Mm-hm.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
-And the man.
-Mm-hm.

37:49.034 --> 37:50.931
So, meet with her!

37:52.758 --> 37:54.551
What? But how?

37:55.413 --> 37:56.896
I thought we hated her.

37:56.931 --> 37:58.517
Now, how're we supposed
to help her?

37:58.551 --> 37:59.862
She'll be helping you.

37:59.896 --> 38:02.103
You gotta keep your
enemies close.

38:02.137 --> 38:03.931
The pretty ones, even closer.

38:05.448 --> 38:06.724
Is that a saying?

38:06.724 --> 38:09.655
When they look like her, yes.

38:09.689 --> 38:12.965
Besides,
you can find out

38:13.000 --> 38:16.965
what makes her tick, and then
you'll know how to destroy her.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.620
You mean, how to destroy
their relationship?

38:19.655 --> 38:22.586
I said, what I meant to say.

38:22.620 --> 38:24.000
You are too into this.

38:25.068 --> 38:27.413
Just committed to the plan.

38:27.413 --> 38:30.517
And bored out of my mind
working from home.

38:30.586 --> 38:33.310
So, are we gonna take this
up a notch?

38:37.137 --> 38:38.137
Elle.

38:39.551 --> 38:41.689
Elle Carver!

38:41.758 --> 38:44.103
-It is so nice to meet you.
-Thank you.

38:44.137 --> 38:46.137
When I found out that you
and Noelle were friends,

38:46.172 --> 38:48.103
I knew this was kismet.

38:48.137 --> 38:50.620
Your book is truly brilliant.

38:50.655 --> 38:52.103
Seriously, we need more

38:52.137 --> 38:54.413
black girl magic
in the world of literature.

38:54.413 --> 38:58.655
Thank you, Sabrina. Honestly,
I'm just happy to be here!

38:58.689 --> 39:02.586
I mean, talk about
black girl magic, look at you!

39:02.655 --> 39:05.172
I've been following your career
for years.

39:05.206 --> 39:06.517
You're a B.

39:06.551 --> 39:08.137
You're too kind.

39:08.172 --> 39:10.482
-Please, have a seat.
-All right.

39:10.517 --> 39:12.517
Now, don't judge me.

39:12.551 --> 39:13.965
My assistant went to go
grab my book,

39:13.965 --> 39:15.068
then you can give me
an autograph.

39:15.137 --> 39:16.137
I got you, girl!

39:18.068 --> 39:21.172
I was telling Elle
how much of a game changer

39:21.206 --> 39:23.137
you've been in this industry.

39:23.172 --> 39:26.586
And, with you coming back
to the States to re-brand,

39:26.655 --> 39:28.655
there's no better place
than Ryse.

39:28.655 --> 39:32.000
I've seen first-hand how you
move and inspire women.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.896
It's time. It's time that you
start empowering them.

39:35.931 --> 39:39.034
Sis, white women have had the
motivational genre on lock

39:39.068 --> 39:41.068
for years.

39:41.137 --> 39:43.862
It time we start making
some moves. Shake things up.

39:45.241 --> 39:48.103
Okay, ladies.
You all got my attention.

39:50.206 --> 39:51.965
So, I was thinking...

39:58.068 --> 40:00.000
That's a quick turnaround time.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.034
Do you really think we'll be
able to get that proposal

40:02.068 --> 40:03.758
back to Sabrina
before Christmas?

40:03.827 --> 40:06.206
Oh, absolutely.
I do them in my sleep.

40:06.241 --> 40:09.206
Together, we can have 'em
by the Christmas party deadline,

40:09.241 --> 40:11.862
and have it drafted
by the top of the year.

40:11.896 --> 40:15.551
-You were brilliant in there.
-What? Me? No, no, no.

40:15.586 --> 40:17.034
-That is Sabrina.
-No.

40:17.068 --> 40:19.137
I loved her idea to announce
our partnership

40:19.172 --> 40:21.931
at the Christmas party,
but it was you that sold me.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.137
You passion for positively
impacting the lives of women,

40:25.137 --> 40:27.482
also the fact that you want
to do a five book series--

40:27.482 --> 40:30.206
Oh, no, no, no!
But it was you!

40:30.241 --> 40:32.724
You! You had that idea
for the live podcast

40:32.793 --> 40:34.206
by women inspired by your book.

40:34.241 --> 40:36.689
And it was your idea
to get us sponsorship

40:36.724 --> 40:39.034
so that way, we can do
a HBCU college tour

40:39.068 --> 40:41.517
and have a scholarship
for aspiring black writers.

40:41.551 --> 40:44.137
You're forgetting that you're
the one that said to document it

40:44.137 --> 40:46.137
so we can use it as a marketing
tool for the launch.

40:46.172 --> 40:48.172
Ah...

40:50.448 --> 40:51.931
You are brilliant.

40:52.000 --> 40:56.793
I love how you understand
my brand, my vision...

40:56.793 --> 40:58.068
me.

40:58.137 --> 41:01.103
Yeah. Yeah, I do, huh.

41:01.137 --> 41:03.241
I mean, I learned a lot
about you today.

41:03.275 --> 41:06.551
About your impact. How you've
helped so many women.

41:06.586 --> 41:08.000
It's really beautiful.

41:09.137 --> 41:10.551
I believe in you, Elle.

41:10.586 --> 41:12.137
Thanks so much.

41:12.206 --> 41:13.241
That means a lot.

41:15.241 --> 41:18.931
I can't wait to tell Terrance
we're besties too!

41:26.137 --> 41:27.758
Special delivery.

41:30.241 --> 41:33.034
You really should consider
delivery as your second job.

41:36.103 --> 41:38.137
Hey, look, I can make banker
on holidays.

41:38.206 --> 41:41.620
Exactly.
What're you doin' here?

41:41.655 --> 41:43.206
Oh, Elle told me
you were working late,

41:43.206 --> 41:45.206
so, here I am.

41:45.241 --> 41:47.758
And the flowers?

41:47.793 --> 41:49.724
Yeah, she said that
she met with her attorney

41:49.758 --> 41:51.689
and she signed up
with you guys.

41:56.137 --> 41:58.758
-What?
-Yeah.

41:58.793 --> 42:00.689
Wait, I'm sorry.
Did I ruin a surprise?

42:00.758 --> 42:02.344
No! That's fine.

42:02.379 --> 42:05.206
-It's fine!
-Okay.

42:05.275 --> 42:06.793
Congratulations.

42:06.827 --> 42:09.275
Yeah.

42:09.310 --> 42:11.620
Thank you. Thank you.

42:11.620 --> 42:15.965
Um, so, where is Elle, to tell
me how worthy I am of worship?

42:16.000 --> 42:18.137
Well, I mean, she wanted
to have them delivered,

42:18.172 --> 42:20.275
but I told her roses
were your favorite

42:20.275 --> 42:22.310
and thought why not
deliver 'em myself.

42:23.275 --> 42:24.344
Right.

42:26.793 --> 42:29.310
-That's really sweet.
-No problem.

42:29.344 --> 42:30.517
Well...

42:31.344 --> 42:33.655
Ah, since you are here,

42:33.689 --> 42:35.172
you have no plans tonight?

42:35.241 --> 42:36.586
No.

42:37.931 --> 42:40.172
Why? What're you thinkin'?

42:41.379 --> 42:46.310
♪ Silent night

42:46.344 --> 42:51.931
♪ Holy night

42:51.931 --> 42:56.586
♪ All is calm

42:56.586 --> 43:02.379
♪ And all is bright...

43:02.413 --> 43:04.344
Yo, can you believe
they still did a midnight

43:04.379 --> 43:07.689
Christmas movie marathons
down at the old theater?

43:07.689 --> 43:10.689
Can you believe
there is still dollar?

43:10.724 --> 43:12.344
-Are you serious?
-Mm-hm.

43:12.379 --> 43:14.379
Wow! That didn't stop us from

43:14.413 --> 43:16.275
sneaking in there
in the eighth grade though.

43:16.344 --> 43:18.241
That's right.

43:18.275 --> 43:21.000
That's because you were
a bad influence on me.

43:21.517 --> 43:24.206
Me? I was the...

43:24.241 --> 43:28.344
You were the one using me to
make, uh, Antoine Bell jealous.

43:28.379 --> 43:32.068
Don't act like you don't
remember his name. I was not.

43:32.103 --> 43:34.344
I just wanted a nice night out
at the movies for Christmas

43:34.379 --> 43:36.206
and...

43:37.862 --> 43:40.241
I used you, okay?
But it didn't work. So...

43:40.275 --> 43:42.310
-You sucked!
-Whatever!

43:42.344 --> 43:43.724
Thank you.

43:45.413 --> 43:48.000
So tell me somethin'...

43:48.000 --> 43:49.758
why isn't there anyone that
I'm making jealous

43:49.827 --> 43:51.034
about being here tonight?

43:52.379 --> 43:54.206
I mean, where's your
boy Chef Jake?

43:54.241 --> 43:56.172
He can't bake cookies?

43:56.172 --> 43:59.344
That's so funny.

43:59.344 --> 44:01.034
It's none of your business.

44:02.827 --> 44:04.000
All right.

44:04.965 --> 44:07.137
You've been datin' since we...

44:07.172 --> 44:08.103
Yep.

44:08.965 --> 44:11.379
I've... dated.

44:11.413 --> 44:12.724
Been dating.

44:12.724 --> 44:14.206
When I have time.

44:15.379 --> 44:17.793
Right. Your MO.

44:17.827 --> 44:20.172
Surprised you
even had time to

44:20.241 --> 44:23.413
start a relationship with me,
let alone anyone.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.103
Wow. Is that where
we're goin' tonight?

44:30.172 --> 44:32.379
Don't act like I didn't rock
your world for two years.

44:35.448 --> 44:36.896
You're right.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.275
You did.

44:51.448 --> 44:52.448
What?

44:52.482 --> 44:53.689
Are you serious? No.

44:53.689 --> 44:56.000
Still, you-you've seen this
like a hundred times.

44:56.068 --> 44:58.827
Shut up. Everyone cries
at this movie.

45:00.413 --> 45:01.827
Stop laughing. It's not...

45:01.862 --> 45:03.172
What? I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

45:03.206 --> 45:05.517
Okay, let me,
let me help you get your tears.

45:05.551 --> 45:08.206
Yeah, yeah,
You're always teasing me.

45:08.241 --> 45:09.965
Why do you do...

45:17.379 --> 45:18.896
-Oh. Ah.
-Oh.

45:18.965 --> 45:21.379
Oh, I'm so sorry!
Here, give it to me.

45:21.413 --> 45:25.310
I'm sure David has something dry
you can change into.

45:25.310 --> 45:27.241
It's all good.

45:27.310 --> 45:29.482
♪ Way heavy on the heart

45:29.517 --> 45:30.379
Here.

45:30.413 --> 45:32.241
♪ It's melancholy

45:32.310 --> 45:35.172
-Um, should I go back--
-Oh, no, no, no.

45:35.206 --> 45:36.793
I got it.

45:40.413 --> 45:43.482
In front of Baby Jesus?

45:43.517 --> 45:45.551
We were just
trying to see a movie

45:45.586 --> 45:48.517
and then we had some cookies but
it's not really what I tried...

45:48.551 --> 45:50.827
It was an accident.

45:50.862 --> 45:52.379
Mm-hmm.

46:05.620 --> 46:08.586
Somebody had a good time.

46:11.241 --> 46:12.931
Stop.

46:14.931 --> 46:16.551
I'll tell you about it tomorrow.
Go to bed.

46:16.586 --> 46:19.586
No!
You gotta give me something.

46:21.482 --> 46:22.896
It was good, okay?

46:22.931 --> 46:25.034
It was, it was great, actually.

46:25.034 --> 46:27.517
So was his chest.

46:27.517 --> 46:29.448
Mm.

46:30.586 --> 46:32.793
Why you look so sad?

46:35.586 --> 46:37.068
I don't know.

46:42.586 --> 46:45.517
Girl, this is everything.

46:46.586 --> 46:47.655
Do you think it will work?

46:47.655 --> 46:51.000
What? With this marketing plan,
it has to.

46:58.586 --> 47:00.310
We need to talk.

47:02.275 --> 47:05.034
-This sounds serious.
-It is.

47:05.103 --> 47:09.413
So, do you wanna tell me,
or do I have to ask you?

47:11.137 --> 47:13.482
-Ask what?
-Who is he?

47:16.655 --> 47:18.137
Who's-who's who?

47:18.172 --> 47:20.517
The man that put
that's making you smile.

47:20.586 --> 47:21.689
I see you glowing.

47:21.758 --> 47:24.551
Your outfit, you're just
covered in with tight clothes,

47:24.620 --> 47:27.103
you're looking good,
smelling good, all day.

47:27.103 --> 47:30.344
Come on. Tell me.

47:30.379 --> 47:33.275
-Who is he?
-Hey. Oh, sorry.

47:33.275 --> 47:34.517
I didn't know
you were in a meeting.

47:34.586 --> 47:36.137
Hi.

47:36.172 --> 47:37.620
Sorry, I had a meeting
with the marketing team,

47:37.655 --> 47:39.137
so I figured I'd pop in.

47:39.172 --> 47:40.689
-Mm.
-Is it a bad time?

47:40.724 --> 47:44.137
No, no, I'm really glad
that you dropped by.

47:44.172 --> 47:47.000
Elle Carver, Vincent Downing.

47:47.034 --> 47:48.551
Nice to meet you.

47:48.620 --> 47:50.689
-The Elle Carver?
-Yes.

47:50.724 --> 47:52.655
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

47:52.689 --> 47:54.620
-I love your work.
-Thank you.

47:54.655 --> 47:56.586
-Yes, ma'am.
-I'll be right with you.

47:58.655 --> 48:00.724
Um...

48:00.758 --> 48:02.517
I got some news.

48:02.551 --> 48:04.172
Uh-oh.

48:04.172 --> 48:06.344
I loved your draft.

48:06.344 --> 48:08.689
I think you're done, my friend.

48:08.724 --> 48:11.344
-Ohh.
-Mm-hmm.

48:11.379 --> 48:13.551
-So no more notes?
-No more notes!

48:13.586 --> 48:16.344
-No more red marks?
-No more red marks.

48:16.344 --> 48:17.655
Oh, how much
I love those red marks.

48:17.689 --> 48:19.034
I know you ha...

48:22.172 --> 48:25.172
No, it's-it's amazing, Vincent.

48:25.172 --> 48:27.068
This is probably
some of your best work.

48:27.103 --> 48:29.551
That's great. Thank you!

48:29.586 --> 48:31.241
No problem.

48:31.275 --> 48:33.689
Is there anything else
I can help you with right now?

48:33.724 --> 48:34.724
-Huh?
-Anything else right now?

48:34.758 --> 48:36.689
Oh, no.

48:36.724 --> 48:38.000
I'll let you two get on with it.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.655
Mm.

48:39.689 --> 48:41.379
-Get some rest.
-I will.

48:41.413 --> 48:44.206
-No more 3:00 a.m. texts.
-No more.

48:44.241 --> 48:46.206
-Bye.
-Bye.

48:46.241 --> 48:49.724
-Bye-bye.
-That's him, right?

48:49.758 --> 48:53.689
-What? Vincent?
-Yes!

48:53.689 --> 48:56.000
-You think Vincent is the guy?
-Yes!

48:56.000 --> 48:58.275
Wait. There's-there's no guy.

48:58.344 --> 49:01.655
Um, but he's just one of our
best-selling authors, you know?

49:01.689 --> 49:05.103
Like you're about to be, girl.
So let's get back to work.

49:06.517 --> 49:11.517
And speaking of that,
I have a mock up

49:11.586 --> 49:13.517
with a little something,
something.

49:13.586 --> 49:16.103
I know you're not done
with your book just yet,

49:16.137 --> 49:18.275
but I was hoping
this could be some inspiration.

49:18.310 --> 49:21.827
El, how did you find the time?

49:21.862 --> 49:25.827
Ah. It was already swirling
around in my head.

49:25.862 --> 49:30.034
You wrote this about me?
About my book?

49:31.137 --> 49:34.206
-Yeah. It was nothing.
-No.

49:35.758 --> 49:38.689
This is something.

49:38.758 --> 49:41.413
Girl, I'm not doing this
with you today.

49:41.413 --> 49:43.655
-What? What's happening?
-That's it!

49:43.689 --> 49:45.758
-We gotta celebrate.
-Celebrate?

49:45.793 --> 49:48.103
Our union. Our partnership.

49:48.137 --> 49:49.758
Sisters leveling up together!

49:49.758 --> 49:51.655
Terrance already had his
good time with you.

49:51.689 --> 49:53.758
Now, it's my turn.
Grab your bag.

49:53.793 --> 49:55.379
Let's go.

49:56.620 --> 49:58.310
Come on.

50:02.827 --> 50:06.137
Come on. You have to remember
some of his exes.

50:06.172 --> 50:07.758
I mean, tell me how they were.

50:07.793 --> 50:08.689
Did you all get along?

50:08.689 --> 50:12.655
Um... we got along
well enough.

50:12.724 --> 50:13.827
Ah...

50:13.896 --> 50:17.827
When I first met him, I couldn't
believe he was single.

50:17.862 --> 50:22.137
I mean, you gotta be honest,
I know that's your boy,

50:22.172 --> 50:24.620
but, sis, he is fine.

50:24.655 --> 50:26.758
I mean, he's all right.

50:26.793 --> 50:28.344
He's the total package.

50:28.413 --> 50:31.413
You gotta be a fool
to let him go.

50:31.413 --> 50:34.448
Or a confused,
complicated soul.

50:34.482 --> 50:37.310
-What about you and your exes?
-I didn't have many.

50:37.344 --> 50:41.172
But my dad,
he was intimidating to them.

50:41.241 --> 50:43.275
I did hide one boyfriend.

50:43.310 --> 50:45.517
I was with him the longest.

50:45.586 --> 50:47.758
Was he the love of your life?

50:47.793 --> 50:51.448
No, he put me down a lot.

50:51.482 --> 50:54.241
Made me feel next to nothing.

50:54.241 --> 50:56.793
But I stayed with him

50:56.827 --> 51:00.448
because part of me believed
it was true.

51:00.482 --> 51:03.689
He was the inspiration
behind my book.

51:03.724 --> 51:05.689
Encouraging woman,
motivating woman

51:05.724 --> 51:08.827
to know their self-worth
no matter who they're with,

51:08.862 --> 51:11.655
because I had to.

51:11.689 --> 51:14.689
And then I met Terrance.

51:14.724 --> 51:17.724
He changed everything for me.

51:17.758 --> 51:20.724
He too was hurt and wounded
after his ex--

51:20.793 --> 51:22.517
Hurt and wounded?

51:22.551 --> 51:25.551
It took a lot for him
to trust me with his heart

51:25.586 --> 51:28.620
after all he had been through.

51:28.620 --> 51:31.172
Yeah. I'm sure.

51:31.206 --> 51:34.689
But he did, and here we are.

51:34.724 --> 51:37.344
I mean, who actually
gets to meet

51:37.379 --> 51:38.862
and be with
the love of their life?

51:38.896 --> 51:43.517
Yeah, who.

51:51.689 --> 51:54.034
-Hey.
-Hey.

51:55.620 --> 51:56.551
Where's Sandra?

51:56.586 --> 51:58.551
Knocked out sleep
from Christmas shopping.

51:58.586 --> 52:00.862
So, best time for me
to wrap her gift.

52:00.896 --> 52:02.896
How was your eve?

52:02.896 --> 52:06.241
Is your diabolical plan of
destroy Black love working?

52:08.896 --> 52:11.344
Oh, come on. No comeback?

52:14.931 --> 52:16.758
She loves him.

52:16.793 --> 52:19.517
Like, really loves him.

52:20.931 --> 52:23.689
And, you do too, right?

52:26.689 --> 52:28.172
Yeah.

52:29.551 --> 52:34.655
And the worst part is...
I like her.

52:34.724 --> 52:38.689
Like, legitimately
I would hang with her.

52:38.689 --> 52:40.758
Mm.

52:40.793 --> 52:43.172
I don't even know
what I'm doing anymore.

52:44.724 --> 52:48.689
I mean, why do I have to give up
everything that I want for her?

52:50.551 --> 52:54.965
But isn't she's kinda giving you
what you really want?

52:55.000 --> 52:58.862
Her signing at Ryse absolutely
solidifies your imprint.

52:58.896 --> 53:02.758
And isn't that the dream?

53:04.758 --> 53:06.413
Yeah.

53:07.862 --> 53:10.482
But why can't I have the dream,
and the man?

53:12.793 --> 53:16.241
Why, why do women
always have to choose?

53:18.655 --> 53:20.413
You wanna know what I think?

53:21.689 --> 53:23.931
You know
how she feels about him.

53:23.965 --> 53:25.827
You know how you feel about him.

53:25.862 --> 53:29.689
And you're kindly clear
on how he feels about her.

53:29.724 --> 53:33.310
But what you seem to be
quite unclear on is

53:33.344 --> 53:36.586
how he feels about you.

53:38.620 --> 53:41.931
Figure that out,
and maybe all of this

53:41.965 --> 53:43.827
will make some sense.

53:45.551 --> 53:47.827
Aw, I hate when you're right.

53:47.862 --> 53:49.931
Then you hate often.

53:53.655 --> 53:55.965
-A live podcast.
-Oh, my God.

53:56.000 --> 53:56.793
That would be so good.

53:56.827 --> 53:58.517
Then we can do
market in dollars.

53:58.551 --> 53:59.931
-Right.
-Scholarships.

53:59.965 --> 54:01.862
-For HPCU.
-Yes.

54:01.862 --> 54:04.379
-For aspiring writers.
-That's it, Black writers.

54:04.413 --> 54:06.586
-Black aspiring writers!
-Yes!

54:06.620 --> 54:08.862
Babe, what are you doing here?

54:08.862 --> 54:10.551
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to interrupt.

54:10.586 --> 54:12.068
-I'm not gonna be here long.
-Yeah, yeah.

54:12.103 --> 54:14.000
What're you doing here?
We have a deadline to catch.

54:14.034 --> 54:15.551
-Okay.
-Yeah, babe.

54:15.586 --> 54:18.448
-We're working.
-All right, look, I'm not...

54:18.517 --> 54:21.517
Noe, would you mind
if I get the room for a second?

54:21.517 --> 54:25.000
Can y'all take a quick break?

54:25.000 --> 54:26.896
Sure.

54:26.931 --> 54:28.379
Thank you.

54:29.896 --> 54:32.034
-Do you want anything?
-No, I'm good.

54:32.068 --> 54:33.724
-Thank you.
- Okay.

54:33.758 --> 54:35.896
We present an update
to Sabrina in an hour.

54:35.931 --> 54:37.379
She wants us to do
a pre-presentation

54:37.413 --> 54:38.862
before the board.
I'm super nervous.

54:38.862 --> 54:40.344
I don't know
if we're gonna do good, baby.

54:40.344 --> 54:42.000
-I'm so scared.
-Okay.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.724
Okay. Just calm down.

54:43.758 --> 54:45.344
-I'm so nervous.
-All right, all right.

54:45.344 --> 54:47.068
That's why I'm here.

54:47.103 --> 54:48.551
Breathe.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.413
Just relax.

54:51.448 --> 54:52.931
All right.
Yes.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.241
Calm down. I'm here.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.068
Now why are you here?

54:57.103 --> 54:58.448
Because I'm worthy

54:58.517 --> 54:59.551
and I deserve this.

54:59.586 --> 55:01.103
I'm sorry, I-I didn't hear you.

55:01.137 --> 55:03.482
Because I'm worthy
and I deserve this.

55:03.517 --> 55:04.931
You know, I'mma little hard
at hearing so--

55:04.931 --> 55:08.620
Baby, because I'm worthy
and I deserve this!

55:08.655 --> 55:10.103
That's what I'm talking about.

55:10.137 --> 55:13.000
Look, I know you've had some
disappointments in the past.

55:13.068 --> 55:14.068
And that's why
you self-published.

55:14.103 --> 55:16.448
But, Noelle is good people.

55:16.482 --> 55:18.931
-She is. Mm-hmm.
-She believes in you.

55:18.965 --> 55:20.931
-She's got your back.
-Yes, she does.

55:20.965 --> 55:23.517
I got your back.

55:23.586 --> 55:25.068
You're gonna do great,
you hear me?

55:25.068 --> 55:26.275
Yes.

55:26.344 --> 55:28.655
You will not fail.
Thank you, babe.

55:28.689 --> 55:31.551
I won't let you.

55:31.551 --> 55:32.724
What else?

55:32.724 --> 55:33.965
If God brought me to it,

55:34.000 --> 55:36.103
he equipped me to do it.

55:36.137 --> 55:38.586
That's right.

55:38.586 --> 55:41.620
-I love you, woman.
-I love you too, Ter Bear.

55:41.655 --> 55:43.827
-How much you love me?
-I love you!

55:43.896 --> 55:45.034
How much?

55:46.103 --> 55:47.827
Mm.

55:52.172 --> 55:53.965
So, what's the problem?

55:54.000 --> 55:56.827
His family's annual
pre-Christmas dinner is perfect!

55:56.862 --> 56:00.000
-His mom loves you.
-This is a mess.

56:00.068 --> 56:03.862
Pretending like
we're still bro and sis.

56:03.896 --> 56:06.482
Elle will definitely catch on.

56:06.482 --> 56:08.689
His parents will be chill.

56:08.724 --> 56:11.137
Mm, once his mama found out
we were dating,

56:11.137 --> 56:14.137
she started sending me
fresh knitted baby clothes

56:14.172 --> 56:15.689
for our future babies.

56:15.724 --> 56:17.137
I don't see the problem.

56:17.172 --> 56:18.862
So what if Elle finds out?

56:18.896 --> 56:21.448
She would be devastated
and she'll leave him.

56:22.517 --> 56:24.827
Mm. And me.

56:24.862 --> 56:26.827
Okay, now I'm really confused.

56:26.827 --> 56:28.034
You're talking about
that deal with Ryse,

56:28.068 --> 56:30.620
the one that has you
on the rise?

56:30.620 --> 56:32.517
Well, she's my friend now.

56:32.551 --> 56:35.655
And she's helping me.
I'm helping her...

56:35.655 --> 56:37.172
I don't know.
This is a mess.

56:37.206 --> 56:39.758
All right, so you're also
his best friend.

56:39.827 --> 56:43.517
So if you don't show,
it's gonna look suspicious.

56:43.551 --> 56:44.896
So, what are you gonna to do?

56:44.965 --> 56:48.551
I know. I know.
I look good.

56:48.586 --> 56:51.137
And no pictures.
Because I charge it.

56:51.172 --> 56:53.034
-Ohh!
-Ah!

56:53.068 --> 56:57.931
Whoo-whee, look at you.
Make yourself useful.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.068
Make yourself useful.
Make yourself useful.

57:00.137 --> 57:01.827
Oh, you look ravishing.

57:01.896 --> 57:04.275
Ohh, give me a spin, give me
a spin, give me a spin.

57:04.310 --> 57:06.724
Ooh, they gonna need some
theme music when you walk in.

57:06.758 --> 57:08.586
-Hey...
-Mm-hmm-hmm.

57:08.620 --> 57:11.793
Thank you for going to this drab
of a Christmas party with me.

57:11.862 --> 57:13.586
Thank Noelle for baby-sitting

57:13.620 --> 57:15.068
so I could go with you.

57:15.103 --> 57:16.206
I'll do no such thing.

57:16.206 --> 57:17.206
She lives here rent free.

57:17.241 --> 57:18.965
So this is her duty.

57:21.931 --> 57:23.310
Shut up.

57:23.310 --> 57:26.689
You know I love giving you two
a chance to bask in your love.

57:26.689 --> 57:28.206
Thanks, sis.

57:28.206 --> 57:29.586
Oh. Give me this.

57:29.620 --> 57:30.758
Mm, let's get out of here

57:30.793 --> 57:32.103
looking all fine
with this animal.

57:32.137 --> 57:33.586

Merry Christmas.

58:25.206 --> 58:26.655
Hi!

58:27.344 --> 58:30.620
Hi! Welcome.

58:30.655 --> 58:32.137
Oh, I'm good.

58:33.931 --> 58:35.655
Hey, hey, look who's here.

58:35.689 --> 58:39.172
-And she brought cake.
-There's my girl!

58:39.206 --> 58:42.206
My love!
My daughter is finally here.

58:42.275 --> 58:43.827
You look beautiful.

58:43.862 --> 58:45.206
Don't start to do
all this stuff---

58:45.275 --> 58:47.965
Hush. I can greet my daughter
if I want to.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.827
You ended things with her.
Not me.

58:53.344 --> 58:55.896
It smells so good in here.

58:55.965 --> 58:58.137
But, where's Elle?
I thought that she'd be helping.

58:58.172 --> 59:01.379
-What?
-Oh, you mean the queen vegan?

59:01.413 --> 59:02.862
She threw out my chitlins

59:02.896 --> 59:04.965
'cause she thought
it was molded food,

59:05.034 --> 59:07.413
then she tried to put
Brussel sprouts in my greens.

59:07.448 --> 59:09.724
Oh, come on, ma. You know
she was just trying to help--

59:09.758 --> 59:11.827
Well, there ain't no trying or
experimenting in my kitchen.

59:11.827 --> 59:14.241
It's Christmas.

59:14.275 --> 59:16.275
In here messing
around with my...

59:18.896 --> 59:20.689
We wouldn't want that.

59:20.724 --> 59:22.344
So where's Elle?

59:22.379 --> 59:24.931
In the den with my dad.
Where it's safe.

59:25.000 --> 59:26.344
Oh, okay, let me
go ahead and say hello.

59:26.379 --> 59:28.862
No, what you need to do is
throw on that apron

59:28.896 --> 59:30.379
and help me finish up in here.

59:30.413 --> 59:32.344
But, ma, I thought you
just said that

59:32.379 --> 59:35.068
there was no nobody touching
nothing up in your kitchen.

59:35.103 --> 59:38.689
No, I said she can't
touch nothing up in my kitchen.

59:38.724 --> 59:40.931
And you know who she is.

59:43.241 --> 59:44.724
You know...

1:00:02.103 --> 1:00:04.137
Hey.
There you are.

1:00:05.689 --> 1:00:08.034
I see much hasn't
changed in here.

1:00:09.344 --> 1:00:13.034
Yeah. You know mom
can't let go of this room.

1:00:15.931 --> 1:00:17.034
Mm.

1:00:17.103 --> 1:00:22.137
Hey, um, now, you've been
so busy with Elle...

1:00:22.206 --> 1:00:25.827
we never really had a chance
to talk about our movie date.

1:00:27.241 --> 1:00:28.896
Date?

1:00:30.275 --> 1:00:33.724
Yeah.
It got... real.

1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:38.896
-Look, if I crossed any lines--
-No. It's fine.

1:00:40.172 --> 1:00:42.758
I didn't take it
any kind of way.

1:00:42.793 --> 1:00:45.206
I mean, you were just
comforting me, right?

1:00:46.931 --> 1:00:50.241
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, right.

1:00:50.275 --> 1:00:51.586
Right.

1:00:52.862 --> 1:00:57.172
So, um... FYI,
my mom has already agreed

1:00:57.172 --> 1:01:00.275
that she's not gonna talk about,
you know...

1:01:00.344 --> 1:01:02.482
Oh. Uh-huh.

1:01:02.517 --> 1:01:04.758
Mention that I'm the best
thing that's happened to you

1:01:04.793 --> 1:01:07.275
since sliced bread
and caller ID?

1:01:12.896 --> 1:01:17.275
I mean, this, this is your home.

1:01:18.413 --> 1:01:20.965
Wherever Elle is,
it's my home.

1:01:23.068 --> 1:01:24.034
Oh.

1:01:25.482 --> 1:01:28.206
So, now your home is wherever
your girlfriend is.

1:01:29.413 --> 1:01:33.793
-That's new.
-Look, don't go there, Noe.

1:01:33.827 --> 1:01:35.827
-I'm just saying...
-What are you saying?

1:01:37.068 --> 1:01:38.793
I mean, what does it
even matter to you?

1:01:38.827 --> 1:01:42.172
-Well, maybe it's because--
-Hey, you two.

1:01:42.241 --> 1:01:44.482
-Hey.
-In here having fun without me?

1:01:44.517 --> 1:01:46.448
-Just catching up.
-I think dinner's ready.

1:01:46.482 --> 1:01:49.241
And, your mom said I can't go
into the kitchen without--

1:01:49.241 --> 1:01:51.413
An escort?

1:01:51.448 --> 1:01:53.103
Protection.

1:01:56.068 --> 1:01:57.310
Come on.

1:02:06.206 --> 1:02:10.206
So, Noelle,
how's everything at Ryse?

1:02:12.482 --> 1:02:16.379
It's great... thanks to Elle.

1:02:16.413 --> 1:02:18.517
No, thanks to Noelle.

1:02:18.551 --> 1:02:22.413
We have a meeting with the board
tomorrow to finalize things.

1:02:22.482 --> 1:02:25.310
In less than a week, Noelle
built out a whole marketing plan

1:02:25.310 --> 1:02:29.241
to help promote my new book,
and it's not even done.

1:02:29.310 --> 1:02:32.172
Yeah, these two are really
shaking things up over there.

1:02:32.206 --> 1:02:34.482
Mm, and seeing that I haven't
read your first book,

1:02:34.482 --> 1:02:36.793
and don't plan on it,
you wanna tell us

1:02:36.793 --> 1:02:39.482
what the second one is about?

1:02:39.482 --> 1:02:42.551
Well, the first book
is about helping women

1:02:42.586 --> 1:02:44.896
unleash and unlock for success.

1:02:44.965 --> 1:02:47.000
And the next one is about

1:02:47.034 --> 1:02:49.172
women unleashing
and unlocking for love.

1:02:49.172 --> 1:02:53.862
Interesting. And you have a lot
of expertise in this area?

1:02:53.896 --> 1:02:56.172
Unleashing in love?

1:02:56.206 --> 1:02:58.034
Mary...

1:02:58.068 --> 1:03:00.413
-What?
-Come on, ma.

1:03:02.275 --> 1:03:04.517
It's gonna be really good.

1:03:04.551 --> 1:03:06.137
Mm-hmm.

1:03:06.206 --> 1:03:09.241
And I think it's gonna be
a huge game changer

1:03:09.275 --> 1:03:11.137
for Black authors
in the self-help space.

1:03:11.206 --> 1:03:14.068
And, hopefully, it's gonna be
big for you.

1:03:14.103 --> 1:03:15.931
I've been watching you
work so hard

1:03:15.965 --> 1:03:18.068
since you were a little girl.

1:03:18.103 --> 1:03:19.862
Maybe we're just proud.

1:03:21.137 --> 1:03:24.310
You, uh, deserve
a little happiness.

1:03:24.379 --> 1:03:26.448
-Thank you.
-Here, here.

1:03:26.482 --> 1:03:28.172
Cheers to Noelle.

1:03:29.448 --> 1:03:33.034
Yes, cheers.
To the both of them.

1:03:33.034 --> 1:03:34.965
You're my two special ladies.

1:03:41.931 --> 1:03:45.586
Well, this is beautiful

1:03:45.620 --> 1:03:48.517
being able to celebrate you
like this, babe.

1:03:48.517 --> 1:03:50.448
With my family.

1:03:50.482 --> 1:03:52.379
I can only hope and pray
that this is

1:03:52.379 --> 1:03:54.862
the first of many more
holidays together.

1:03:54.862 --> 1:03:57.344
Oh, sweetie,
I feel the same.

1:03:58.655 --> 1:04:00.586
I love you so much, Ter Bear.

1:04:01.655 --> 1:04:03.000
I love you too.

1:04:04.344 --> 1:04:06.931
Oh, all right, all right,
can we clear the table?

1:04:06.931 --> 1:04:09.482
So we can pull the desserts out.

1:04:11.448 --> 1:04:14.482
Don't worry about it, Elle.
I-I'll get it. Just...

1:04:23.103 --> 1:04:24.931
I-I'll get it.

1:04:29.344 --> 1:04:31.655
No, wait.
Hey, where're you going?

1:04:31.689 --> 1:04:33.344
No. No, wait, wait.
Where're you going?

1:04:33.379 --> 1:04:35.931
No, the coat,
I cannot stay here.

1:04:35.931 --> 1:04:38.655
What's wrong? Hey.

1:04:38.689 --> 1:04:41.310
Hey, look, it's gonna be okay.

1:04:43.551 --> 1:04:46.586
Whatever it is.
I'm-I'm right here.

1:04:52.172 --> 1:04:54.965
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:57.620
-Noe, we can't...
-I'm sorry.

1:04:57.655 --> 1:04:59.068
I'm sorry.

1:05:00.172 --> 1:05:04.206
No, wait, I'm not,
I'm not sorry.

1:05:04.241 --> 1:05:06.068
I'm confused.

1:05:07.586 --> 1:05:09.379
Why didn't you choose me?

1:05:11.172 --> 1:05:13.655
Why couldn't you choose me?

1:05:13.655 --> 1:05:16.000
So that's it?

1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:17.551
You're using her to hurt me?

1:05:17.586 --> 1:05:22.241
-No. I'm with her because...
-Because?

1:05:23.517 --> 1:05:25.206
Why are we talking about this,
Noelle?

1:05:25.241 --> 1:05:27.310
Because we never
talk about this.

1:05:28.793 --> 1:05:32.034
Through all the laughs
and smiles...

1:05:34.275 --> 1:05:38.206
we've never discussed why
we couldn't make it all the way.

1:05:39.517 --> 1:05:44.655
We never discussed why you
going and staying in London

1:05:44.689 --> 1:05:46.551
was the biggest mistake.

1:05:48.172 --> 1:05:51.931
Hell, you even
rebounded with a fake Noelle.

1:05:53.586 --> 1:05:56.379
You told me to go!

1:05:56.413 --> 1:05:59.206
-New beginnings, remember?
-No, it's...

1:05:59.241 --> 1:06:02.137
I was just trying
to be supportive.

1:06:04.241 --> 1:06:07.551
Hold you down.
That's what we do, right?

1:06:11.310 --> 1:06:13.103
Dammit, Terrance.
Are you blind?

1:06:13.137 --> 1:06:14.758
Like, are you blind?

1:06:14.793 --> 1:06:18.413
I'm still in love with you.
I jus...

1:06:18.413 --> 1:06:19.655
And what happened
the other night--

1:06:19.724 --> 1:06:21.586
Look, look, look, Noe, Noe...

1:06:24.724 --> 1:06:28.275
I'm sorry if I led you on.

1:06:29.586 --> 1:06:30.655
I just missed my friend.
And-and--

1:06:30.724 --> 1:06:32.275
And?

1:06:37.551 --> 1:06:39.413
Please stop.

1:06:39.448 --> 1:06:40.689
Please stop.

1:06:40.758 --> 1:06:43.310
Just tell your parents
I was sick.

1:06:45.620 --> 1:06:47.034
Noelle.

1:06:48.586 --> 1:06:50.448
So, once the outline
is complete,

1:06:50.482 --> 1:06:52.758
on page six you'll see our
prelaunch plan.

1:06:52.758 --> 1:06:55.241
She'll tackle
a chapter teaser each week

1:06:55.241 --> 1:06:56.758
to get the buzz going,

1:06:56.758 --> 1:06:58.758
hopefully get some
new trending topics

1:06:58.758 --> 1:07:03.517
and new followers to pre-order
the book before it even sells.

1:07:04.827 --> 1:07:06.724
This is wonderful.
Really.

1:07:06.758 --> 1:07:11.310
I think I speak for all of us
when I say this is impressive.

1:07:11.310 --> 1:07:13.793
Elle, is there anything
you'd like to add?

1:07:14.724 --> 1:07:16.827
No.

1:07:16.862 --> 1:07:21.482
Oh... okay, well, we'll give
these numbers a closer look,

1:07:21.482 --> 1:07:24.586
but I'm good with all of this.

1:07:24.655 --> 1:07:27.793
And you made
the Christmas deadline.

1:07:27.793 --> 1:07:28.758
All thanks to Elle.

1:07:28.758 --> 1:07:31.172
We actually make
a really great team.

1:07:31.206 --> 1:07:34.620
Yes. We actually did.

1:07:34.620 --> 1:07:36.206
Excuse me.

1:07:40.862 --> 1:07:41.896
Well...

1:07:41.896 --> 1:07:44.724
Excuse me, Sabrina.
Excuse me, everyone.

1:07:45.862 --> 1:07:47.344
Elle?

1:07:47.379 --> 1:07:49.344
Elle, hello?
Where're you going?

1:07:49.379 --> 1:07:51.551
Elle, stop!
What's going on?

1:07:51.586 --> 1:07:54.827
-You're her, aren't you?
-Her who? What are you talk--

1:07:54.862 --> 1:07:55.689
Don't act like I'm an idiot.

1:07:55.724 --> 1:07:57.758
I overheard
your whole conversation

1:07:57.827 --> 1:07:59.413
last night while
I was in the kitchen.

1:07:59.482 --> 1:08:01.896
-Elle, I don't know--
-You're the ex.

1:08:01.931 --> 1:08:06.379
-The one that broke his heart.
-I am.

1:08:06.379 --> 1:08:09.275
But I thought you found
a man of your own.

1:08:09.310 --> 1:08:11.448
I didn't realize you were
still in love with mine.

1:08:11.482 --> 1:08:13.620
-Elle, I'm so sorry.
-Sorry for what?

1:08:13.655 --> 1:08:15.413
Sorry for pretending to be
my friend?

1:08:15.448 --> 1:08:17.482
Sorry for acting like you saw
something in me?

1:08:17.550 --> 1:08:19.550
I do!
I do see something in you.

1:08:19.550 --> 1:08:22.274
And we are friends, Elle!
I wanna help.

1:08:22.309 --> 1:08:23.758
You saw a come up.

1:08:23.792 --> 1:08:26.172
An opportunity and a fool.

1:08:27.448 --> 1:08:30.758
Some friend.
Goodbye, Noelle.

1:08:30.792 --> 1:08:32.931
Elle. But, Elle...

1:08:32.965 --> 1:08:34.448
Elle!

1:08:37.862 --> 1:08:41.448
Noelle.
I need to see you. Now.

1:08:44.931 --> 1:08:47.241
Sabrina, I'm so sorry.

1:08:47.274 --> 1:08:48.862
Is everything okay
between you two?

1:08:48.862 --> 1:08:50.620
-Yes. Absolutely.
-Well, I hope so.

1:08:50.655 --> 1:08:52.896
Because the board was impressed
and they're ready to move.

1:08:52.931 --> 1:08:55.620
This is big for everyone.
Especially you.

1:08:55.655 --> 1:08:59.413
I know. I promise.
Everything will be fine.

1:08:59.448 --> 1:09:02.309
Well, I'm not so sure
about that.

1:09:02.344 --> 1:09:05.862
Noelle, you are an amazing
junior executive,

1:09:05.931 --> 1:09:07.792
but I draw the line
when you interfere

1:09:07.792 --> 1:09:10.482
in people's personal lives
and bring it into the office.

1:09:12.344 --> 1:09:14.000
Honestly, I didn't think
it would get this far--

1:09:14.033 --> 1:09:16.689
So, it was you? You had Richard
call and ask me out?

1:09:16.724 --> 1:09:18.827
Wait. Richard? What?
He called you?

1:09:18.862 --> 1:09:20.931
Yes. He called me
before the meeting.

1:09:20.965 --> 1:09:22.827
-You didn't know?
-No.

1:09:22.862 --> 1:09:24.792
I had no idea.

1:09:24.827 --> 1:09:26.379
Can you believe that?

1:09:26.448 --> 1:09:27.827
Before he even had a chance
to see me

1:09:27.862 --> 1:09:29.965
in my two sizes down
designer couture dress,

1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:31.862
he asked me out.

1:09:31.931 --> 1:09:34.000
That's great.

1:09:34.033 --> 1:09:36.344
I'm petrified.

1:09:36.379 --> 1:09:38.965
Don't give me those Bambi eyes.

1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.274
I don't do this. I don't date.

1:09:41.274 --> 1:09:43.274
I work.
I build. I strategize.

1:09:43.274 --> 1:09:46.585
I achieve. I don't... date.

1:09:47.827 --> 1:09:49.689
Okay, then, don't go.

1:09:50.827 --> 1:09:51.965
I can't.

1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:53.931
Why not?

1:09:53.965 --> 1:09:57.827
Because... I like him.

1:09:59.344 --> 1:10:01.585
And no one should be alone
on Christmas.

1:10:03.034 --> 1:10:03.965
You're right.

1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:06.655
I don't have it all...

1:10:06.689 --> 1:10:07.965
but I would like a little bit

1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:09.862
of whatever this is.

1:10:09.931 --> 1:10:13.275
Well, then, relax and be you.

1:10:13.275 --> 1:10:14.655
It's who he's interested in.

1:10:15.931 --> 1:10:17.793
But, but how do I know?

1:10:19.862 --> 1:10:24.550
Noelle, I can't tell you how
long it's been since I've dated.

1:10:24.620 --> 1:10:28.344
And love...
even longer than that.

1:10:34.965 --> 1:10:38.517
You... you could do this.

1:10:39.896 --> 1:10:42.724
You just have to surrender
yourself to the moment.

1:10:42.793 --> 1:10:46.309
Open yourself up
to the opportunity.

1:10:46.344 --> 1:10:49.793
He's making his
intentions clear.

1:10:49.793 --> 1:10:52.413
-That's half the battle.
-You make it sound so easy.

1:10:52.413 --> 1:10:54.827
Because it is.

1:10:54.862 --> 1:10:57.896
You just have to take it
day by day.

1:10:57.965 --> 1:11:02.379
And, if it's for you,
love will come and find you.

1:11:05.344 --> 1:11:07.655
You can't force anyone
to love you.

1:11:09.034 --> 1:11:12.862
Just open your eyes
and listen with your heart.

1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:18.931
You'll know if it's real...

1:11:21.896 --> 1:11:23.862
and you'll know
what you have to do.

1:11:26.724 --> 1:11:28.448
Oh...

1:11:28.517 --> 1:11:30.000
Where are you going?

1:11:31.896 --> 1:11:34.000
I just figured out
what I have to do.

1:11:35.931 --> 1:11:37.862
Well, don't be late to
the venue for the party!

1:11:37.896 --> 1:11:40.068
You know I don't deal
with caterers!

1:11:44.413 --> 1:11:46.724
-Hey. Come on in.
-Hey.

1:11:46.758 --> 1:11:49.379
-How are you?
-I'm good. How are you?

1:11:49.413 --> 1:11:52.758
-Noelle?
-Right here.

1:11:57.034 --> 1:11:59.413
-Hey.
-Hey.

1:12:04.103 --> 1:12:07.103
I'm sorry I was ignoring
your calls.

1:12:07.137 --> 1:12:09.655
But I see you got my message?

1:12:09.724 --> 1:12:11.379
You talk to her yet?

1:12:12.758 --> 1:12:15.758
She left my parents' house
right after you.

1:12:15.793 --> 1:12:17.000
She's staying at a hotel.

1:12:17.068 --> 1:12:20.931
So... no surprise
she spazzed out

1:12:20.965 --> 1:12:22.000
after your meeting.

1:12:24.827 --> 1:12:26.655
She's mad, mad.

1:12:28.103 --> 1:12:30.620
Can you blame her?

1:12:30.655 --> 1:12:32.379
I should have told her
the truth.

1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:36.689
Why didn't you?

1:12:36.758 --> 1:12:39.655
No, I didn't want her to be
uncomfortable, you know.

1:12:39.689 --> 1:12:41.068
I didn't want her to
have to worry about--

1:12:41.103 --> 1:12:42.827
Worry about what?

1:12:45.896 --> 1:12:48.620
I thought she was
the one, Noelle.

1:12:50.172 --> 1:12:55.000
I hurt somebody that has done
nothing but put me first.

1:12:55.068 --> 1:12:57.000
My wants, my needs...

1:12:58.655 --> 1:13:00.517
So, she caters to you?

1:13:01.241 --> 1:13:03.000
-No.
-Got it.

1:13:04.689 --> 1:13:06.793
She sacrifices for me.

1:13:09.896 --> 1:13:12.034
We want the same things
at the same time.

1:13:13.724 --> 1:13:15.137
We were talking
marriage in a year,

1:13:15.172 --> 1:13:16.965
and kids after that...

1:13:16.965 --> 1:13:19.068
Really?

1:13:19.137 --> 1:13:21.862
Even with her career
on the rise?

1:13:21.896 --> 1:13:24.000
Yes.

1:13:24.034 --> 1:13:25.896
Even with all of that,

1:13:25.931 --> 1:13:28.793
a life with me
was never a second thought.

1:13:30.965 --> 1:13:34.000
We wanna be together
more than anything.

1:13:38.655 --> 1:13:41.379
I wanted it to work, Terrance.

1:13:43.793 --> 1:13:45.827
Right.

1:13:45.827 --> 1:13:47.965
Not more than
you wanted your career.

1:13:49.172 --> 1:13:51.379
And that's fine,
I know.

1:13:52.965 --> 1:13:55.034
But I'm in a
different place now.

1:13:58.172 --> 1:13:59.965
So am I.

1:14:35.931 --> 1:14:37.068
Hi.

1:14:44.103 --> 1:14:45.275
Ooh.

1:14:45.309 --> 1:14:47.896
-Everyone's here.
-Mm-hmm.

1:14:47.931 --> 1:14:51.965
-But, of course.
-Including Richard.

1:14:52.034 --> 1:14:53.585
Oh, I saw.

1:14:55.689 --> 1:14:57.585
Ooh.

1:14:57.620 --> 1:14:59.724
Oh, I'm so nervous.
I'm so...

1:14:59.758 --> 1:15:01.620
-Do I look nervous?
-Uh-huh.

1:15:01.620 --> 1:15:03.620
No, no, no.
You look fabulous..

1:15:03.655 --> 1:15:05.172
Thank you.

1:15:05.206 --> 1:15:08.034
Oh! Congratulations.

1:15:08.103 --> 1:15:09.758
For what?

1:15:09.758 --> 1:15:12.275
You haven't checked your email?

1:15:12.275 --> 1:15:14.309
It's been confirmed.

1:15:14.344 --> 1:15:18.585
You've been green-lit
to start your own imprint.

1:15:18.585 --> 1:15:20.275
Sabrina, seriously?

1:15:20.275 --> 1:15:24.034
Oh, my gosh!
Yes! Yes! Oh, my gosh!

1:15:24.103 --> 1:15:27.309
Which writer will you
sign first?

1:15:27.344 --> 1:15:28.172
I don't know.

1:15:28.206 --> 1:15:30.620
I can sign writers now.
Oh, my gosh!

1:15:30.655 --> 1:15:33.000
Mm, I have an idea.

1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:49.620
-Thank you so much. That mean...
-Hi, Tenese.

1:15:49.620 --> 1:15:52.172
Hi, how are you?
Could I speak with her?

1:15:52.206 --> 1:15:53.172
Yes.

1:15:55.344 --> 1:15:56.862
-Elle, you look--
-Don't.

1:15:56.896 --> 1:15:59.827
I'm only here at the advisement
of my attorney.

1:15:59.862 --> 1:16:02.068
Wanted to make sure
things are copasetic

1:16:02.103 --> 1:16:04.931
while he works on getting out
of my contract at Ryse.

1:16:04.965 --> 1:16:09.309
-Elle, please reconsider.
-Why? Your job depends on it?

1:16:09.344 --> 1:16:11.034
No.

1:16:12.413 --> 1:16:14.206
Forget my job.

1:16:14.241 --> 1:16:17.689
You know what,
do what you want with Ryse.

1:16:17.689 --> 1:16:20.275
I worked really hard
to get here,

1:16:20.344 --> 1:16:22.896
and if I have to do it again
from scratch, I will.

1:16:25.413 --> 1:16:28.068
But getting there
is never really there,

1:16:28.103 --> 1:16:30.034
you know, if you don't
remember the lessons

1:16:30.068 --> 1:16:32.172
along the way
that will keep you there.

1:16:35.448 --> 1:16:37.034
You finally read my book?

1:16:37.068 --> 1:16:41.000
Elle, I'm so sorry
for everything.

1:16:42.448 --> 1:16:44.241
I know I did a lot
of things wrong.

1:16:44.309 --> 1:16:46.827
Yes.

1:16:46.827 --> 1:16:48.241
But the one thing
I did do right,

1:16:48.275 --> 1:16:51.931
was elevate and push you
to elevate your platform.

1:16:53.068 --> 1:16:55.689
And your voice deserves
to be heard.

1:16:55.689 --> 1:16:58.275
Because I really,
truly believe in you.

1:16:58.344 --> 1:17:01.137
I don't get you, Noelle.
I don't.

1:17:01.172 --> 1:17:04.448
Not even after
the 20 messages I left you?

1:17:04.482 --> 1:17:06.758
Twenty six.

1:17:06.793 --> 1:17:07.931
Right.

1:17:13.827 --> 1:17:15.793
What is he doing here?

1:17:15.827 --> 1:17:18.000
-He's here for you.
-No.

1:17:18.068 --> 1:17:20.206
I don't wanna be a part of
your little games.

1:17:21.517 --> 1:17:25.206
No more games.
No more lies.

1:17:26.827 --> 1:17:28.724
He is my very best friend.

1:17:30.413 --> 1:17:32.931
And you are what's best for him.

1:17:32.965 --> 1:17:34.758
I thought I wanted
what we had back,

1:17:34.793 --> 1:17:37.103
but I'm wrong.

1:17:38.413 --> 1:17:40.448
So, now you don't love him?

1:17:40.482 --> 1:17:42.482
I've known him forever.

1:17:42.517 --> 1:17:44.758
So I will always love him.

1:17:44.793 --> 1:17:46.448
But he's in love with you.

1:17:54.068 --> 1:17:55.896
I don't know what to believe.

1:17:56.793 --> 1:17:58.206
That's fair.

1:17:59.482 --> 1:18:01.724
At least go listen for yourself.

1:18:07.309 --> 1:18:10.172
Time to unlock and unleash
the love.

1:18:34.379 --> 1:18:36.896
When we were kids,
we used to lay down

1:18:36.931 --> 1:18:38.793
at the bottom of the tree
at my parent's house

1:18:38.793 --> 1:18:41.206
and look up at the lights.

1:18:41.241 --> 1:18:45.448
Yeah. That was my favorite
thing to do on Christmas day.

1:18:51.862 --> 1:18:53.379
You two gonna be okay?

1:18:55.379 --> 1:18:58.137
Yeah. I think so.

1:18:58.137 --> 1:18:59.482
We still got a lot of
talking to do,

1:18:59.517 --> 1:19:02.137
but whatever you said helped.

1:19:02.206 --> 1:19:04.517
Just told the truth, for once.

1:19:07.585 --> 1:19:09.517
Hey, look, Noelle, um...

1:19:11.034 --> 1:19:13.379
You don't have to say it.

1:19:13.379 --> 1:19:16.482
I love you.
All right, I always will.

1:19:16.550 --> 1:19:19.172
And I would never trade
what we have for anything.

1:19:20.931 --> 1:19:25.344
Good. 'Cause I love you back,
and thank you.

1:19:25.344 --> 1:19:26.931
For what?

1:19:28.379 --> 1:19:30.413
You letting me go
last year...

1:19:32.034 --> 1:19:34.896
it was the release
I didn't know I needed

1:19:34.931 --> 1:19:36.585
so I can grow
and go after the things

1:19:36.620 --> 1:19:38.241
I really wanted at the time.

1:19:41.206 --> 1:19:43.550
And that doesn't mean
I don't want love.

1:19:43.585 --> 1:19:45.896
-No.
-Mm.

1:19:45.931 --> 1:19:48.379
I just want a love
that wants me back.

1:19:48.379 --> 1:19:52.448
I want at the right time,
the right place,

1:19:52.482 --> 1:19:54.103
with the right one.

1:19:56.517 --> 1:19:58.206
That's deep.

1:19:58.206 --> 1:20:01.241
That is an excerpt
from your girl's book.

1:20:03.655 --> 1:20:05.448
Anyway, you deserve love,
Noelle.

1:20:05.517 --> 1:20:07.206
And you'll find it.

1:20:07.206 --> 1:20:10.585
-It just ain't with the chef.
-Oh, there you go again.

1:20:10.620 --> 1:20:12.172
Not minding your business.

1:20:13.482 --> 1:20:16.550
Hey, uh, Elle's gonna
stay at Ryse, too.

1:20:16.585 --> 1:20:18.931
-Really? Why?
-Yeah.

1:20:18.965 --> 1:20:20.517
I talked to her.

1:20:20.550 --> 1:20:22.034
And you got my back.

1:20:22.034 --> 1:20:23.448
I got yours.

1:20:29.275 --> 1:20:31.413
-Thank you.
-No problem.

1:20:31.448 --> 1:20:33.517
-I'll talk to you later.
-Okay.

1:20:57.034 --> 1:20:58.862
May I have this dance?

1:20:59.620 --> 1:21:02.000
Wow.

1:21:02.034 --> 1:21:03.965
All of this from a man,

1:21:03.965 --> 1:21:07.550
and I can't even get to get
dressed up for his own book.

1:21:07.620 --> 1:21:10.482
Hey, photoshoots are soft.
I stand by that.

1:21:10.517 --> 1:21:12.172
Mm-hmm.

1:21:12.206 --> 1:21:15.172
-You look very nice, sir.
-Thank you.

1:21:15.206 --> 1:21:18.103
And you look... exquisite.

1:21:18.103 --> 1:21:20.482
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

1:21:21.724 --> 1:21:25.862
So, who's the lucky escort
tonight?

1:21:27.379 --> 1:21:31.620
Mm, this designer bag,
with the tag tucked in,

1:21:31.655 --> 1:21:34.620
and some celebratory champagne.

1:21:34.655 --> 1:21:36.068
Celebratory?

1:21:39.172 --> 1:21:43.965
-I got my own imprint.
-Wha-a-at?

1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:46.517
Finally, finally-finally,

1:21:46.550 --> 1:21:49.379
I get to publish
books that I want,

1:21:49.448 --> 1:21:52.309
you know,
promote new voices and writers,

1:21:52.344 --> 1:21:54.103
and tell the stories
I really wanna tell.

1:21:54.103 --> 1:21:57.000
That is amazing.

1:21:58.379 --> 1:22:02.172
-And so well deserved.
-Thank you.

1:22:02.172 --> 1:22:05.448
So, how long do I have to wait

1:22:05.517 --> 1:22:09.689
for you to offer me a deal
at this new mystery imprint?

1:22:09.724 --> 1:22:11.689
Not a joke, Vincent.

1:22:11.724 --> 1:22:13.379
I'm not joking.

1:22:14.724 --> 1:22:16.655
Well, you know
I can't afford you.

1:22:16.689 --> 1:22:18.309
I don't care.

1:22:19.448 --> 1:22:22.550
-You're crazy.
-Yes, I am.

1:22:24.309 --> 1:22:25.550
For you.

1:22:27.758 --> 1:22:29.550
Even after I--

1:22:29.585 --> 1:22:32.550
Made a huge mistake
by turning me down?

1:22:32.585 --> 1:22:34.585
Mm.

1:22:34.620 --> 1:22:38.206
Well, that could be
easily rectified, Noelle.

1:22:39.689 --> 1:22:46.137
Ahem, uh, Vincent...
will you go out with me?

1:22:47.724 --> 1:22:52.655
-Mm. I don't know.
-Oh, my God.

1:22:52.655 --> 1:22:54.379
You already know.

1:22:56.172 --> 1:22:59.689
Noelle, you've been my Carla
since chapter three

1:22:59.724 --> 1:23:00.793
of my second book.

1:23:00.827 --> 1:23:03.482
Oh, my goodness.

1:23:05.620 --> 1:23:06.689
That was corny,

1:23:06.758 --> 1:23:08.482
but probably
the most romantic thing

1:23:08.517 --> 1:23:09.793
anyone has ever said to me.

1:23:09.827 --> 1:23:11.758
Maybe that's because
Eugene is tired

1:23:11.758 --> 1:23:13.758
of running from
what he really wants.

1:23:13.793 --> 1:23:18.172
And just may decide to ask for
Carla's hand by chapter nine?

1:23:18.241 --> 1:23:21.275
Mm, well, Carla
might be inclined,

1:23:21.309 --> 1:23:23.275
depends on what happens
in chapter ten.

1:23:23.309 --> 1:23:28.379
Why don't we let the rest of
this book write itself?

1:25:02.379 --> 1:25:04.448
As long as you're happy,
I'm happy.

1:25:04.482 --> 1:25:06.413
Mm, yeah.

1:25:22.379 --> 1:25:24.689
You're supposed to stay awake.

1:25:24.689 --> 1:25:26.344
Listen...

1:25:28.275 --> 1:25:29.655
Who's watching who over here,
huh?

1:25:29.724 --> 1:25:32.241
-Hey.
-Hey, Bubba. Hey, Bubba.

1:25:32.275 --> 1:25:34.309
Come on, sit down,
I got gifts.

1:25:34.379 --> 1:25:36.309
-Okay.
-I'll be right back, okay?

1:25:36.379 --> 1:25:37.896
-Here you go.
-Let's see. Let's see.

1:25:37.931 --> 1:25:39.413
-Brother-in-law.
-All right, all right.

1:25:39.448 --> 1:25:41.724
-All right.
-Right next to me.

1:25:41.758 --> 1:25:43.620
Okay. Mm.

1:25:46.931 --> 1:25:50.689
-I want the big one. W--
-Open it and see.

1:25:53.965 --> 1:25:55.689
Relator?

1:25:58.275 --> 1:26:00.413
Don't play with me.
Don't...

1:26:00.448 --> 1:26:02.413
Are you, are you leaving?

1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:06.517
So last night
your girl found out

1:26:06.550 --> 1:26:08.827
she finally got
her own imprint!

1:26:08.862 --> 1:26:10.482
Ohh!

1:26:10.517 --> 1:26:11.931
Also, you know that means

1:26:11.931 --> 1:26:14.309
I can finally make sure
that I move out--

1:26:14.344 --> 1:26:15.550
Get up out of my house.

1:26:15.620 --> 1:26:17.931
Oh!
This is the best gift ever.

1:26:17.965 --> 1:26:19.620
Holy...

1:26:19.620 --> 1:26:20.931
Yes, it's a miracle.
Answer it.

1:26:20.965 --> 1:26:23.309
Okay, so what I'm gonna do is

1:26:23.344 --> 1:26:24.827
I'm gonna give you your gift.

1:26:24.862 --> 1:26:27.862
Oh, yes, I'm going to help you
start packing now.

1:26:27.931 --> 1:26:29.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Here you go.

1:26:29.655 --> 1:26:31.309
Oh.

1:26:31.344 --> 1:26:32.931
Oh, I thought I was gonna turn
off the Wi-Fi

1:26:32.931 --> 1:26:34.482
to get you out of here.

1:26:34.517 --> 1:26:35.931
-Forget him.
-I'm gonna do it.

1:26:35.931 --> 1:26:38.931
-I am so proud of you.
-Thank you.

1:26:38.931 --> 1:26:40.550
-You did it.
-I did.

1:26:40.620 --> 1:26:43.413
-You did.
-Got my own imprint!

1:26:43.413 --> 1:26:44.862
-Yes!
-Ya!

1:26:44.931 --> 1:26:46.965
I love it!

1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:51.379
-Thank you so much.
-Ohh, it was nothing.

1:26:51.448 --> 1:26:54.448
-Wait, was he kidding?
-Uh-huh.

1:26:54.448 --> 1:26:56.620
He, I don't want him
touching my stuff, you know.

1:26:56.655 --> 1:26:58.965
David, don't touch my stuff!
