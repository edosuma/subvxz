we're a three‐income family.

And he says to me
that there's plenty more

then he does this with his eye.

What exactly do
you do for this Vince?

04:08.815 --> 04:10.684
Well, I take a package from him

04:10.717 --> 04:13.319
and I deliver it
to his uncle Downtown

04:13.353 --> 04:15.622
but it's not so
simple as it sound.

04:15.656 --> 04:18.391
Vince says that
someone might follow me

04:18.423 --> 04:21.027
so I must never walk
the same way twice.

04:21.060 --> 04:24.330
So, today I walk like this.

You are obviously involved

04:58.498 --> 05:00.333
Cousin, delivering
a package is illegal?

05:00.366 --> 05:02.435
Well, it could be
depending on what's in it.

05:03.570 --> 05:04.505
What's in it?

05:06.807 --> 05:07.908
I don't know.

05:09.442 --> 05:10.911
Well, then, how do you
know it's illegal?

05:10.944 --> 05:12.813
Because the package
belongs to a man

05:12.846 --> 05:16.750
who works out of a car with
secretaries in the back seat.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.785

‐ They are not secretaries.

05:21.522 --> 05:22.989
What is your point?

05:23.023 --> 05:25.626
Well, the point is you
never look before you leap.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.827
Which is why you
get into these messes

05:26.860 --> 05:28.729

we have to open it.

Well, of course he is.
Don't be ridiculous.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.794
And you thought
he was doing something illegal.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.565
It's illegal gambling.
It's a crime.

to prison for that

13:28.441 --> 13:31.444
Whatever happened to "A man's
gotta do what a man's gotta do?"

13:33.880 --> 13:37.017
No. See, you don't understand.

13:37.050 --> 13:41.487
If we testify against this man,
he's going to kill us.

13:43.223 --> 13:48.228
Cousin, we have to go over
there, and say what we know.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.495
It's the right thing to do.

13:49.530 --> 13:51.464
Yes, I know
it's the right thing to do

13:51.497 --> 13:53.867
but we can't do it.

13:53.900 --> 13:56.870
It's not like we're taking
a big bite out of crime.

13:56.903 --> 13:59.105
I mean, if‐if we testify
maybe we'll put away

13:59.139 --> 14:00.874
one small‐time criminal

14:00.907 --> 14:02.008
but someone else
will just take his place.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.877
It's not worth dying for.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.281
Psst!

14:09.983 --> 14:12.252
Psst! Psst.

14:18.158 --> 14:21.061
Uh, Mr. O'Day,
we...we've been thinking

14:21.094 --> 14:24.965
and we're not sure that
we can identify the man.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.667
I mean, it was awfully dark.

14:26.700 --> 14:27.601
It was noon.

14:30.704 --> 14:33.239
Right. Right.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.208
I don't know
how to say this. Uh, but‐‐

14:35.241 --> 14:36.543
You've been thinking it over

14:36.577 --> 14:38.545
and you've decided
not to testify?

14:38.579 --> 14:41.147
Well, only in the legal sense.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.985
There goes my case.

14:47.487 --> 14:50.190
All rise.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.424
(male #1)
'This hearing
is now in session.'

14:51.457 --> 14:53.694
(male #1)
'The honorable
Francis T. Ceretto presiding.'

14:53.727 --> 14:57.197
Oh! I was hoping
for Judge Wapner.

15:02.969 --> 15:05.171
Uh, Your Honor,
I'm, uh, sorry to say

15:05.205 --> 15:08.141
that the state has
suffered a minor setback.

15:08.174 --> 15:09.643
We have no witnesses.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.212
Now I'd call that a setback.

15:12.245 --> 15:15.281
Well, if there are no
witnesses, there's no case.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.083
‐ So I'm gonna‐‐
‐ Please, please.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.452
I‐I am a witness.

15:19.485 --> 15:22.422
Ah! No, no, he‐he misunderstood.

15:22.455 --> 15:27.160
He's not a witness witness,
he's a...Jehovah's Witness.

15:32.198 --> 15:34.367
You can't do this.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.136
Cousin, I have to do this.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.004
Vince used me.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.706
My honor is at stake.

15:39.740 --> 15:41.441
My honor.

15:41.474 --> 15:44.077
You don't mess around
with a Mypiot's honor.

15:46.079 --> 15:49.182
Your Honor, the State would
like to call Balki Bartokomous.

15:59.693 --> 16:02.362
Uh, one, uh, two,
uh, one, two..

16:05.131 --> 16:07.568
Mr. Bartokomous,
you're supposed to sit up there.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.706
‐ Really?
‐ Yes.

16:12.739 --> 16:16.009
‐ Right next to the judge?
‐ Yes.

16:16.042 --> 16:17.644
Wow.

16:26.252 --> 16:28.354
Hi.

16:28.388 --> 16:31.024
Nice robes.

16:31.057 --> 16:32.693
Please, uh, sit down.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.362
Raise your right hand.

16:36.396 --> 16:37.598
Do you swear to tell the truth

16:37.631 --> 16:40.667
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

16:40.701 --> 16:43.737
Well, of course, I do.
Don't be ridiculous.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.608
[instrumental music]

16:47.641 --> 16:51.745
Then after Vince kicked down
our door and threatened us

16:51.778 --> 16:54.447
I went to sleep,
because I said to myself

16:54.480 --> 16:56.650
I said, "Balki,
you should go to sleep

16:56.683 --> 16:59.085
"because tomorrow you're
going to have to go to court

16:59.119 --> 17:01.054
"and testify,
and you don't want to have

17:01.087 --> 17:03.223
those big black circles
under your eyes."

17:03.256 --> 17:07.460
Like...like, when cousin
Larry makes breakfast, and..

17:07.492 --> 17:09.663
Cousin, you know
when, when you leave the eggs

17:09.695 --> 17:12.464
'in the pan too long, and they
get all black around the edges.'

17:12.498 --> 17:14.334
Your Honor!

17:14.367 --> 17:16.569
‐ Go pour the Fruit Loops.
‐ Sustained, sustained.

17:16.603 --> 17:17.538
(Francis)
'Mr. Dunne.'

17:17.570 --> 17:19.204
Thank you, Your Honor.

17:22.509 --> 17:23.777
Mr. Bartokomous..

17:25.811 --> 17:28.615
...I think it's rather obvious
that you're an immigrant.

17:28.649 --> 17:30.517
So let's stop
beating around the bush.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.588
Why did you come to America?

17:34.621 --> 17:38.825
Oh, because when
I'm a little small boy

17:38.859 --> 17:41.595
I dream to come to America.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.630
The land of the free..

17:43.664 --> 17:45.198
...the home of the braves.

17:48.234 --> 17:53.574
And my dream was
to travel all over this land.

17:53.607 --> 17:58.712
From...California
to the New York island.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.615
From the Redwood forest..

18:03.416 --> 18:05.652
...to the gulf stream water.

18:06.820 --> 18:10.256
This land...was made for you..

18:14.227 --> 18:14.761
...and me.

18:17.463 --> 18:19.833
‐ And if I had a hammer‐‐
‐ I see!

18:26.707 --> 18:32.145
Yes, America, a land
of beauty, a land of freedom

18:32.178 --> 18:34.615
a land of...opportunity?

18:34.648 --> 18:36.850
Yes. It's a wonderful country.

18:36.883 --> 18:40.286
So you came to
get rich. Didn't you?

18:40.320 --> 18:41.688
‐ No.
‐ Just answer the question.

18:41.722 --> 18:43.790
‐ I did.
‐ Ah‐ha! So you admit!

18:43.824 --> 18:45.792
You came here to get rich!

18:47.460 --> 18:49.429
‐ No.
‐ Which is it? Yes or no?

18:49.462 --> 18:50.196
I object!

18:51.698 --> 18:53.734
That's badgering an immigrant!

18:56.570 --> 18:58.572
You can't object!

18:58.605 --> 18:59.773
Uh, who is this person?

19:01.307 --> 19:02.776
[clears throat]
That's Cousin Larry.

19:04.711 --> 19:07.180
Cousin Larry, sit down.

19:10.350 --> 19:13.520
I submit to the court
that this Balki Bartokomous..

19:14.555 --> 19:16.456
Is that a Russian name?

19:17.858 --> 19:19.760
No, it's Myposian.

19:19.793 --> 19:20.861
I'll bet.

19:22.228 --> 19:23.864
I submit that Mr. Bartokomous

19:23.897 --> 19:26.399
came to this country
with good intentions

19:26.432 --> 19:28.468
but when he discovered
that Americans in fact

19:28.502 --> 19:32.573
work for a living, he decided
to take an easier route..

19:32.606 --> 19:35.408
...and that's when he
attempted to recruit my client

19:35.441 --> 19:38.645
to join him in his
heinous plan, illegal gambling.

19:38.679 --> 19:39.946
Objection!

19:42.382 --> 19:45.986
Balki is‐is being abused by
this‐this ambulance chaser!

19:46.019 --> 19:48.354
Your Honor.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.423
Young man, you are in contempt.

19:50.456 --> 19:51.625
Well, I don't care!

19:51.658 --> 19:54.661
Well now, if you keep this up
I'll have to put you in jail.

19:57.263 --> 19:57.898
Okay.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.703
Your Honor, the defense
moves that the charges

20:02.736 --> 20:03.870
in this case be dismissed.

20:07.541 --> 20:11.444
Uh, Mr. O'Day, unless there
are any other witnesses

20:11.477 --> 20:14.414
to substantiate
Mr. Bartkomous' testimony

20:14.447 --> 20:17.718
I am afraid, I'm going to
have to dismiss the charges.

20:17.751 --> 20:19.586
How can you do that?

20:19.620 --> 20:20.887
He's a bad man.

20:20.921 --> 20:23.289
And‐and you have
to take him away

20:23.323 --> 20:25.859
because the good
people have to be safe.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.494
How can this happen in America?

20:28.529 --> 20:29.329
It happens.

20:37.638 --> 20:42.375
Uh, well, I have no choice
but to release the defendant.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.277
Well, now wait a minute.

20:44.310 --> 20:47.914
That‐that's it?
Y‐you're gonna just let him go?

20:47.948 --> 20:49.449
[Larry scoffs]

20:49.482 --> 20:52.919
Y‐Your Honor,
guys like Vince are allowed

20:52.953 --> 20:55.656
to walk the streets,
because people like me

20:55.689 --> 20:58.491
are‐are afraid to
testify against them.

20:58.525 --> 21:01.361
While this man
who's not even an American yet

21:01.394 --> 21:03.997
is‐is up there risking
his life to do what's right.

21:04.030 --> 21:07.901
Well‐well, I,
I'm ashamed of myself.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.270
Uh, Cousin Larry..

21:14.340 --> 21:16.910
...is this rambling
taking us anyplace?

21:18.078 --> 21:18.979
Yes, it is.

21:20.581 --> 21:22.983
I can back up
everything this man said.

21:23.016 --> 21:24.417
I want to testify.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.286
[Jennifer and Mary cheering]

21:27.087 --> 21:28.922
You're making a big mistake.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.891
My life is full of big mistakes.

21:36.997 --> 21:38.765
(Larry)
'You can threaten
us all you want'

21:38.799 --> 21:40.734
but we're still gonna testify.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.969
And if there is any
justice in this world

21:43.003 --> 21:45.038
we're gonna put you away.

21:45.071 --> 21:48.374
We're gonna send you up
the river without a poodle.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.076
[crowd cheering]

21:57.818 --> 22:00.821
[instrumental music]

22:01.421 --> 22:03.990
[keys jingling]

22:11.798 --> 22:12.899
We're gonna have
to get that fixed.

22:12.933 --> 22:14.000
Right.

22:24.878 --> 22:26.647
Balki, I don't believe it.

22:28.148 --> 22:29.950
[sighs]

22:33.687 --> 22:37.123
I saw a side of myself
today that I never saw before.

22:37.157 --> 22:39.593
Cousin, I saw that side, too.

22:41.962 --> 22:43.096
It wasn't pretty.

22:45.666 --> 22:46.633
Do you mind?

22:46.667 --> 22:47.934
I'm‐I'm trying to resurrect

22:47.968 --> 22:49.970
a modicum of dignity here.

22:50.003 --> 22:53.106
Oh, cousin, you got modicums
you don't even know about.

22:54.808 --> 22:58.011
It just took a while
to get past all that fear.

22:58.044 --> 23:02.182
Yeah, well...I'm sorry
I almost let you down.

23:02.215 --> 23:05.519
Cousin, you don't have
to apologize to me.

23:05.552 --> 23:07.921
When it really counted
you came through

23:07.954 --> 23:09.756
and I should thank you.

23:10.957 --> 23:13.193
Thank you.

23:13.226 --> 23:15.696
Well, the important
thing is, because of you

23:15.729 --> 23:18.932
Vince is out of business
for a long, long time.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.703
I hope his secretaries get work.

23:24.971 --> 23:29.843
You know, buddy, I fell apart
a little in court today

23:29.876 --> 23:31.945
but deep down inside..

23:31.978 --> 23:34.648
...I knew things would work out.

23:34.681 --> 23:36.049
When guys threaten you like that

23:36.082 --> 23:38.619
you gotta show 'em who's boss.

23:38.652 --> 23:41.522
You gotta show 'em they
can't make you run and hide.

23:41.555 --> 23:43.089
Huh? Huh?

23:43.123 --> 23:44.658
[phone ringing]

23:44.691 --> 23:45.826
[chuckles]

23:47.861 --> 23:49.162
Hello?

23:50.130 --> 23:51.898
Just, just a minute.

23:51.932 --> 23:54.234
Cousin, it's someone
who wants to confirm

23:54.267 --> 23:56.036
two plane reservations
to Buenos Aires.

24:00.206 --> 24:01.207
I'll take this.

24:03.810 --> 24:04.911
This is Jose Vasquez.

24:09.616 --> 24:11.618
No, no, I won't
be needing those tickets.

24:13.253 --> 24:15.021
Yeah. Via con dios to you, too.

24:17.223 --> 24:18.725
[clears throat]

24:20.727 --> 24:22.195
You gotta show 'em
on which side of the fence

24:22.228 --> 24:25.566
you're gonna stand.

24:25.599 --> 24:28.569
You gotta show 'em
they can't push you around.

24:29.703 --> 24:32.105
You gotta take a stand.

24:32.138 --> 24:32.906
You're not buying this, are you?

24:32.939 --> 24:35.542
No way Jose.

24:35.576 --> 24:37.110
[instrumental music]

24:40.747 --> 24:43.483
[theme music]
