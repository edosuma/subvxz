lt still has a nice ring to it.

Gravity, temperature, atmosphere,
light, all in a protective stasis field.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.721
And these get put
into the large containment unit?

01:37.931 --> 01:41.850
Right. See, these modules
will keep the specimens alive,

01:42.060 --> 01:45.938

that's gonna keep us alive.

Now l have to go
and replicate this 51 2 times,

01:48.483 --> 01:50.275

l'll have to divert power

01:50.485 --> 01:52.486

to the replicator for a while.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.988

- Baby?

10:13.654 --> 10:15.113
This is a surprise.

10:16.490 --> 10:18.366
More so for me.

10:18.576 --> 10:21.411
This pregnancy is unlike anything
l have ever encountered.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.747
Since she came to me
a few hours ago,

10:23.956 --> 10:28.752
l have done two complete
examinations of Counselor Troi.

10:30.046 --> 10:32.047
Now, this is the first examination.

10:32.256 --> 10:36.051

took place 1 1 hours ago.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.561
This is the second exam,
one hour later.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.772
Now, it's consistent,
except for the fact

10:48.981 --> 10:51.775
that it appears
that the fetus is several weeks older.

At this growth rate, Counselor Troi
will have her baby in about 36 hours.

ls it a humanoid? An alien?

half human, half Betazoid.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.501
PlCARD:
Captain's log, supplemental.

32:42.710 --> 32:44.336
For reasons as yet unknown,

32:44.545 --> 32:49.091
one of the deadly specimens
of plasma plague has begun to grow.

32:49.550 --> 32:50.968
Report, Mr. La Forge.

32:51.386 --> 32:52.719
Captain, we've checked everything.

32:52.929 --> 32:54.721
There's no reason
for this to be happening.

32:54.931 --> 32:57.307
l can't even isolate the cause
of the problem.

32:57.517 --> 33:00.352
RlKER: Come on, Data.
We'd better get down there.

33:01.312 --> 33:03.313
- Dr. Pulaski.
PULASKl [OVER lNTERCOM]: Yes?

33:03.523 --> 33:05.983
They're having a little difficulty
on Cargo Deck 5.

33:06.192 --> 33:07.401
Your presence is requested.

33:07.610 --> 33:08.944
PULASKl:
I'm on my way.

33:15.785 --> 33:18.161
WESLEY:
You never talk about yourself.

33:19.163 --> 33:22.666
Sure l do. All the time.

33:22.875 --> 33:25.502
WESLEY: People say you're very old.
- Oh?

33:25.670 --> 33:27.212
WESLEY:
And that you knew Captain Picard

33:27.380 --> 33:29.214
when he was on the Stargazer.

33:30.008 --> 33:33.468
No, l never knew the captain
till l came onboard.

33:33.886 --> 33:35.887
Well, everyone's very curious
about you.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.265
Yes, l'll bet they are.

33:39.475 --> 33:41.935
Yeah, they wanna know
where you're from.

33:43.563 --> 33:45.147
And where do they say?

33:45.857 --> 33:48.608
Well, they say that you're
from Nova Kron, and that--

33:48.818 --> 33:51.653
PlCARD [OVER lNTERCOM]:
Mr. Crusher, report to the Bridge.

33:51.904 --> 33:53.488
Aye, sir. Gotta go.

34:01.831 --> 34:03.457
Thanks.

34:04.375 --> 34:07.044
For a dish of Dovlarian soufflé?

34:07.462 --> 34:10.088
No, not for the soufflé.

34:11.174 --> 34:13.842
l meant for the rest.

34:15.386 --> 34:17.220
That's why l'm here.

34:18.389 --> 34:19.681
Thanks.

34:21.142 --> 34:22.601
Bye.

34:27.231 --> 34:29.441
RlKER:
Why this module and not the others?

34:29.650 --> 34:34.988
Computer, run diagnostic
on module L-73.

34:35.198 --> 34:37.574
COMPUTER:
All circuits functional.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.785
LA FORGE:
The environment's as programmed.

34:40.161 --> 34:42.204
Temperature 97 degrees Kelvin.

34:42.413 --> 34:45.248
Radiation flux zero.
Stasis field nominal.

34:45.458 --> 34:48.293
Everything exactly the way
it should be, right down the line.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.213
Perhaps it is a sensor malfunction.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.090
Computer, inquiry.

34:53.299 --> 34:57.636
ls growth actually occurring
in module L-73?

34:58.054 --> 34:59.554
COMPUTER:
Confirmed.

34:59.764 --> 35:02.265
Doctor, one of the specimens
is growing.

35:02.475 --> 35:04.810
- Destroy it now.
- l can't.

35:05.144 --> 35:07.646
Data, prepare to jettison the module.

35:07.855 --> 35:09.106
We can't do that either.

35:09.315 --> 35:10.732
lt will go into a spore and remain

35:10.942 --> 35:13.610
until it comes into contact
with a planet or another ship.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.612
And the results would be disastrous.

35:15.822 --> 35:18.865
Commander, your attitude tells me
that no matter how bad l think it is,

35:19.075 --> 35:20.283
it's actually worse?

35:20.493 --> 35:22.786
- This is not gonna hold it.
- Go on.

35:22.995 --> 35:25.163
HESTER: The rate of growth
is increasing so rapidly,

35:25.373 --> 35:27.499
within 30 minutes,
it's gonna push out of its module.

35:27.708 --> 35:30.043
Within two hours, it'll break out
of the containment area.

35:30.253 --> 35:31.962
No, no, it can't break through this.

35:32.171 --> 35:33.797
Yes, it will.

35:35.967 --> 35:39.719
Captain, we may not be able
to get control of this situation.

35:39.929 --> 35:42.889
l recommend we arrange transfer
of all nonessential personnel

35:43.099 --> 35:44.141
to the saucer section.

35:44.350 --> 35:45.851
[OVER lNTERCOM]
lf we lose containment,

35:46.018 --> 35:47.894
we should be prepared to separate.

35:48.104 --> 35:49.146
Make it so.

35:49.480 --> 35:52.315
Why this one specimen
and none of the others?

35:52.525 --> 35:54.818
Something is stimulating it.

35:55.027 --> 35:56.319
Do you have the etiology?

35:56.529 --> 35:58.613
- Do you know how it was developed?
- Yes.

35:58.823 --> 36:00.532
lt's right over here.

36:05.454 --> 36:08.415
lt's a mutated strain developed
by Dr. Susan Nuress

36:08.624 --> 36:12.419
during an outbreak of plasma plague
70 years ago in the Oby system.

36:12.628 --> 36:14.963
lt was number nine
in a series of 58 tests.

36:15.173 --> 36:20.385
This particular one bombarded
by low levels of Eichner radiation.

36:23.723 --> 36:26.933
Could exposure to Eichner radiation
stimulate growth?

36:27.143 --> 36:29.936
lt could, but l...

36:31.147 --> 36:33.023
l've got some.

36:33.566 --> 36:35.442
Why didn't you detect this before?

36:35.776 --> 36:37.611
l don't know. lt wasn't here before.

36:37.820 --> 36:38.945
Well, it is now.

36:39.155 --> 36:41.031
What emits that type of radiation?

36:41.240 --> 36:42.657
A subspace phase inverter.

36:42.867 --> 36:43.992
We don't have one.

36:44.202 --> 36:47.412
- Certain cyanoacrylates.
- Also not on this ship. What else?

36:47.622 --> 36:49.581
Because it's here,
and we'd better find it.

37:04.972 --> 37:07.849
l can feel that some of the people
are very worried.

37:08.059 --> 37:12.103
Yes. l feel it too, but don't you worry.

37:12.313 --> 37:14.022
lt's me, Mommy.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.149
l'm the reason.

37:16.984 --> 37:18.109
What?

37:19.070 --> 37:20.820
lt's me.

37:21.781 --> 37:23.698
- You?
- Yes.

37:23.908 --> 37:27.744
l have to leave you now,
or it'll be very bad for everyone.

37:28.287 --> 37:30.038
What are you saying?

37:31.332 --> 37:33.833
l have to leave now.

37:35.044 --> 37:36.878
Leave?

37:38.130 --> 37:40.340
You're going to die.

37:40.675 --> 37:42.342
No, you can't!

37:42.551 --> 37:44.219
Sickbay, this is Counselor Troi.

37:44.428 --> 37:46.513
l need the doctor
in my quarters now!

37:46.722 --> 37:49.975
lan! lan, no! lan!

37:52.478 --> 37:53.478
[TROl SOBS]

37:53.646 --> 37:55.772
TROl:
lt's lan. Hurry!

37:58.734 --> 38:00.485
PULASKl:
What happened?

38:00.695 --> 38:03.113
- Did he eat anything? Did he fall?
- No.

38:03.322 --> 38:04.364
[DEVlCE WHlRS]

38:04.532 --> 38:07.242
Commander, the child is the source
of the unusual radiation.

38:07.451 --> 38:09.911
lan said he's the reason
the ship is in danger.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.997
That analysis is correct.

38:12.498 --> 38:15.083
l'm losing lifesigns.

38:15.459 --> 38:18.253
You must save him.

38:39.859 --> 38:41.609
l'm sorry.

38:41.819 --> 38:43.278
[TROl SOBS]

39:52.723 --> 39:54.391
LA FORGE [OVER lNTERCOM]:
Commander Riker,

39:54.558 --> 39:57.185
the containment field has stabilized.

39:57.395 --> 39:58.728
Thank you, lieutenant.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.566
Then lan was right.

40:03.818 --> 40:05.485
He was the cause.

40:05.945 --> 40:07.570
Apparently so.

40:15.788 --> 40:20.041
He is a life-force entity.

40:21.085 --> 40:25.130
When we passed each other in space,
he was curious about us.

40:25.339 --> 40:29.426
So he decided the best way to learn
was to go through the process.

40:30.010 --> 40:35.390
To be born, to live as one of us,
and in that way to understand us.

40:36.642 --> 40:39.227
He never meant any harm.

40:39.437 --> 40:42.605
There was a moment
when you smiled.

40:46.777 --> 40:49.070
He said, "Thank you."

40:50.781 --> 40:54.659
l told him we will miss him.

40:57.079 --> 40:59.414
And l will.

41:21.020 --> 41:22.812
Standard station orbit, Mr. Crusher.

41:23.022 --> 41:24.272
Aye, sir, standard orbit.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.024
Transporter Room 3,
this is the captain.

41:26.233 --> 41:27.275
We have arrived.

41:27.610 --> 41:30.862
[OVER lNTERCOM] Let's make
this transfer with all deliberate speed.

41:31.071 --> 41:32.655
Aye, sir.

41:33.282 --> 41:36.451
l'll be glad to be relieved
of this cargo.

41:37.077 --> 41:39.370
You have the Bridge, Number One.

41:40.247 --> 41:41.831
WESLEY:
Captain?

41:42.917 --> 41:44.584
Could l see you
when you have a moment?

41:44.793 --> 41:46.544
ln my Ready Room
when your duties permit.

41:46.754 --> 41:48.087
Thank you, sir.

41:48.547 --> 41:51.007
How long is it gonna take
to develop a vaccine?

41:51.217 --> 41:53.593
We may never develop one.

41:53.802 --> 41:55.720
Then all of this
might have been in vain?

41:55.930 --> 41:56.971
No, let's hope not.

41:57.181 --> 41:59.724
DATA [OVER lNTERCOM]:
Stand by to energize.

42:00.100 --> 42:01.809
Good luck.

42:06.982 --> 42:11.277
Data, you can lock onto the first group
and begin transporting on my mark.

42:12.071 --> 42:13.071
[DOOR BEEPS]

42:13.239 --> 42:14.572
Come.

42:16.742 --> 42:20.203
Captain Picard,
l've thought about this a lot.

42:20.412 --> 42:23.081
l want to remain on the Enterprise.

42:28.420 --> 42:30.004
Have you discussed this
with your mother?

42:30.589 --> 42:31.839
No, sir.

42:32.049 --> 42:34.300
Before l do that,
l'd like your permission to stay.

42:35.636 --> 42:39.264
Wesley, it's a little more complicated
than that.

42:39.473 --> 42:43.851
Captain, this is where l want to be.

42:44.353 --> 42:46.813
This is where l feel l belong.

42:47.022 --> 42:49.148
RlKER [OVER lNTERCOM]:
Captain. Transfer complete.

42:49.358 --> 42:50.608
We are ready to leave orbit.

42:50.818 --> 42:52.068
Make it so, Number One.

42:52.278 --> 42:54.237
Return to your position.

43:11.255 --> 43:12.839
RlKER:
All systems secure.

43:13.048 --> 43:14.841
PlCARD:
Take us out of orbit, Mr. Crusher.

43:15.050 --> 43:16.884
Lay in a course
for the Morgana Quadrant.

43:17.094 --> 43:18.428
WESLEY:
Yes, sir.

43:18.637 --> 43:21.848
Ensign Crusher has requested
to remain on the Enterprise.

43:22.057 --> 43:23.975
l'm not surprised.
How did you respond?

43:24.184 --> 43:25.351
l haven't as yet, Number One.

43:25.561 --> 43:27.812
l didn't think
that it was my responsibility alone.

43:28.022 --> 43:30.607
His remaining will create difficulties
for all of us.

43:30.816 --> 43:33.693
Yes, indeed. With his mother gone,
who will see to his studies?

43:33.902 --> 43:35.695
Exactly.

43:35.904 --> 43:39.032
Of course, that duty will fall
to Commander Data.

43:39.241 --> 43:40.950
And who will tuck him in at night?

43:41.160 --> 43:42.869
Come on, commander.

43:43.912 --> 43:46.247
l will accept that responsibility.

43:46.457 --> 43:49.250
Well, we know he'll get his sleep.

43:49.460 --> 43:51.586
PlCARD: Well, then that takes care
of the practical,

43:51.795 --> 43:55.214
but there's more to growing up
than that.

43:56.091 --> 43:57.383
Now, it's my belief, Number One,

43:57.593 --> 43:59.469
that you're best qualified
to supervise that.

43:59.678 --> 44:01.554
You willing to serve?

44:02.056 --> 44:04.098
Difficult decision.

44:07.144 --> 44:08.561
Yes, l can do that.

44:09.104 --> 44:11.022
PlCARD: Mr. Crusher,
communicate with your mother

44:11.231 --> 44:13.858
at Starfleet Medical Headquarters.
Give her my regards and tell her

44:14.068 --> 44:16.277
you have my permission
to remain on the Enterprise.

44:16.487 --> 44:19.697
But l will abide by her wishes.

44:19.907 --> 44:23.242
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
l know she'll agree.

44:23.452 --> 44:25.787
Now, if you have course
and speed laid in...

44:25.996 --> 44:27.497
Yes, sir, they are.

44:27.706 --> 44:31.209
Then, Mr. Crusher, engage.
