[ Buzzing musically ]

Cybonic plague?

Someone besides myself
is -- Is unwell?

[ Whirring ]

Optimus!

[ Laughs evilly ]

16:03.771 --> 16:05.938
Such irony!

16:05.940 --> 16:08.841
But after ages
of endless battle,

16:08.843 --> 16:10.843
the mighty optimus prime

16:10.845 --> 16:14.948
is felled by a simple virus
from the distant past.

16:14.950 --> 16:16.316
[ Whirs sadly ]

16:16.318 --> 16:18.117
And what makes you think

16:18.119 --> 16:21.186
I would save the life
of my oldest enemy?

16:21.188 --> 16:26.459
Megatron,
your treachery is -- Ugh!

[ Buzzing musically ]

16:29.263 --> 16:30.629
Oh.

And just what is it
that I want most, scout?

[ Buzzing musically ]

[ Chuckles ]

16:38.672 --> 16:40.739
Did you not see?

16:40.741 --> 16:44.443
I do slay optimus
by my own hand, at will,

16:44.445 --> 16:46.545
whenever I desire.

16:46.547 --> 16:49.649
[ Buzzing musically ]

16:51.685 --> 16:54.020
He told Megatron
if he lets the plague virus

16:54.022 --> 16:55.355
destroy the real optimus,

16:55.357 --> 16:58.091
Megatron will never get
the chance to do it himself.

16:58.093 --> 16:59.459
Smart.

16:59.461 --> 17:01.094
Twisted.

17:01.096 --> 17:04.598
Soundwave,
do I take your silence

17:04.599 --> 17:08.335
to mean you concur with
knockout's medical expertise?

17:12.405 --> 17:16.141
Speak now
or forever hold your piece.

Hmm.

17:35.461 --> 17:37.595
Scrap.

17:40.700 --> 17:43.568
After our deep history
together,

17:43.570 --> 17:47.404
to not watch the spark ebb
from optimus' eyes

17:47.406 --> 17:50.974
with my very own...

17:50.976 --> 17:52.276
[ Buzzing musically ]

17:52.278 --> 17:55.979
Well played, scout.

17:57.815 --> 18:00.617
The chemical formula
for the cure you seek --

18:00.619 --> 18:03.520
Not that I expect you
to know how to read it.

18:03.522 --> 18:05.122

Not yet.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.860
And how am I to accomplish

18:09.862 --> 18:12.764
terminating optimus
as you propose

18:12.766 --> 18:17.670
while I'm trapped here
in a perpetual daydream?

18:17.672 --> 18:20.439
Once you release me
from this prison,

18:20.441 --> 18:22.641
you will have the cure.

18:29.882 --> 18:31.883
Come on, come on.

18:31.885 --> 18:35.987
You must guarantee my recovery,

18:35.989 --> 18:39.891
or optimus
fades to gunmetal gray --

18:39.893 --> 18:42.226
<i>The real optimus.</i>

Disconnect Bumblebee now!

You were watching.
You tricked me!

[ High-pitched ringing ]

19:46.028 --> 19:49.395
It was the inevitable outcome.

19:49.397 --> 19:51.164
Ahh.

19:51.166 --> 19:53.332
Of course, it would be wrong

19:53.334 --> 19:57.369
to allow Megatron to perish
by an autobot's hand.

And how is the patient
doing today?

Funny you should ask.

Not sure what the 'bots did
in there,

20:46.387 --> 20:50.422
but Megatron's registering
zero brain-wave activity.
