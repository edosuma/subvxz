<i>(Karen) WONDERFUL! COME ON, TOM.</i>

13:56.961 --> 14:00.044
I'M SORRY ABOUT ANNE.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.667
YOU'VE BEEN GOOD TO US,

14:01.758 --> 14:03.248
AND FOR US.

14:03.343 --> 14:08.759
NOW, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ANNE.

14:08.848 --> 14:12.591
SHE'LL ACCEPT ME...
EVENTUALLY.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.551
YOU SEE, MR. ROGERS,

14:14.645 --> 14:18.354
CHILDREN ARE THE MOST COMPLICATED
THINGS IN THE VVORLD.

14:18.441 --> 14:20.523
I COULD BE THE GREATEST
COOK IN THE WORLD,

14:20.568 --> 14:23.401
THE FINEST,
MOST EXCITING PLAYMATE,

14:23.488 --> 14:26.025
THE MOST INCREDIBLY
INTERESTING COMPANION,

14:26.074 --> 14:29.362
BUT THOSE
ARE VERY TINY NICHES--

14:29.410 --> 14:34.029
A SHELF IN THE STOMACH, A VERY
SMALL LEDGE IN THE BRAIN.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.410
IT'S THE HEART
I HAVE TO ENTER--

14:36.501 --> 14:38.242
THE CHILD'S HEART--

14:38.336 --> 14:42.375
AND THIS IS A DEEP PLACE,
DIFFICULT TO REACH.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.414
<i>BUT THAT TOO
WILL COME.</i>

14:51.599 --> 14:53.135
ANNE, WE'RE
GOING FOR A RIDE.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.432
WILL YOU COME
WITH US?

14:54.519 --> 14:56.430
I WANT TO STAY HOME.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.603
I DON'T WANT
HER HERE.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.100
ANNE, YOU
MUSTN'T SAY THAT.

15:00.191 --> 15:01.898
I DON'T WANT
HER HERE!

15:01.943 --> 15:03.650
(Grandma) DO I BOTHER YOU, ANNE?

15:03.736 --> 15:05.477
I NEVER WANTED
YOU HERE.

15:05.571 --> 15:09.109
IT WAS THEM-- FATHER
AND TOM AND KAREN.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.158
THEY WANTED YOU,
BUT I DIDN'T.

15:12.245 --> 15:15.579
THEY NEEDED YOU, BUT
I NEVER NEEDED YOU.

15:15.665 --> 15:16.655
<i>(father)
ANNE.</i>

15:16.749 --> 15:18.615
BUT IT'S TRUE.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.575
YOU SIT AND
YOU TALK TO HER,

15:20.670 --> 15:22.911
<i>AND YOU EAT THE
FOOD SHE MAKE-S',</i>

15:22.964 --> 15:25.501
<i>AND YOU MAKE
BELIEVE, FATHER.</i>

15:25.591 --> 15:27.093
<i>THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.</i>

15:27.135 --> 15:28.921
<i>YOU MAKE BELIEVE</i>

15:28.970 --> 15:31.302
<i>AS IF IT
WERE A GAME.</i>

15:31.389 --> 15:33.471
AS IF SHE WERE REAL.

15:33.558 --> 15:35.265
BUT SHE'S NOT REAL.

15:35.309 --> 15:36.765
SHE'S A MACHINE.

15:36.853 --> 15:38.844
NOTHING BUT AN
OLD MACHINE!

15:38.938 --> 15:42.272
ANNE. ANNE, YOU'D
BE SURPRISED, MY DEAR,

15:42.316 --> 15:43.772
HOW MUCH
A MACHINE CAN DO

15:43.860 --> 15:45.976
BESIDES PLAYING
AND COOKING.

15:46.070 --> 15:49.608
THIS MACHINE, FOR EXAMPLE--
THIS MACHINE CAN LOVE.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.940
LOVE? LOVE WHO?

15:51.993 --> 15:53.279
YOU, ANNE.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.451
I CAN LOVE YOU,
AND I DO.

15:55.496 --> 15:58.204
I LOVE YOU MORE THAN...

15:58.291 --> 16:00.828
MORE THAN
TONGUE CAN TELL.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.454
<i>YOU DON'T LOVE ME.</i>

16:02.545 --> 16:03.706
<i>YOU CAN'T.</i>

16:03.796 --> 16:05.878
SHE SAID
SHE LOVED ME.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.296
SHE?

16:07.341 --> 16:08.797
MY MOTHER.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.626
SHE SAID,
"I LOVE YOU,"

16:10.720 --> 16:12.051
BUT SHE LIED.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.720
SHE LIED!

16:13.806 --> 16:15.547
AND YOU'RE
LIKE HER.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.224
I HATE HER,
AND I HATE YOU!

16:23.649 --> 16:25.390
SHE'S RUN AWAY BEFORE.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.850
I'LL GO AFTER HER.

16:26.944 --> 16:30.812
THERE'S NO PLACE
FOR HER TO GO.

16:30.907 --> 16:33.945
NO PLACE TO GO,
EXCEPT TO ME.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.604
ANNE.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.101
GET AWAY.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.933

17:08.027 --> 17:10.018

DO YOU HATE ME?

17:10.112 --> 17:13.605
BECAUSE YOU'RE

17:13.699 --> 17:14.951

17:15.034 --> 17:16.444
I HATE HER!

17:16.536 --> 17:18.867
<i>WHY DO YOU
HATE HER, ANNE?</i>

17:18.913 --> 17:20.074
BECAUSE.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.369

17:21.415 --> 17:22.621

17:38.724 --> 17:41.637
YES.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.139
BUT SHE LET

17:44.230 --> 17:46.221

DONE THAT TO ME!

17:46.274 --> 17:48.390
SHE SHOULDN'T!
