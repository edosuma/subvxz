WEBVTT

00:00.200 --> 00:01.442
So here's what you missed on Glee.

00:01.480 --> 00:02.550
<i>Shelby is back with Beth</i>

00:02.560 --> 00:04.090
<i>and she's starting her own
show choir at McKinley.</i>

00:04.130 --> 00:05.830
<i>Mercedes is on board because she's tired</i>

00:05.860 --> 00:07.300
<i>of Rachel and the Glee Club.
I've outgrown you.</i>

00:07.310 --> 00:08.490
<i>But Quinn's only playing nice</i>

00:08.530 --> 00:09.830
<i>so she and Puck can get the baby back.</i>

00:09.860 --> 00:11.440
<i>Kurt, Rachel and Brittany are all</i>

00:11.470 --> 00:12.770
<i>running for senior class president,</i>

00:12.810 --> 00:14.670
<i>and Sue's running for Congress so she</i>

00:14.710 --> 00:16.309
<i>can cut funding for glee
clubs everywhere.</i>

00:16.480 --> 00:17.960
<i>And that's what you missed on Glee.</i>

00:18.150 --> 00:20.240
Glee S03E04 "Pot O'Gold"

00:20.410 --> 00:22.260
Made by Mikhel for: Subtitulos.es
== SPREAD THE WORD ==

00:24.850 --> 00:26.470
Top o' the mornin', Brittany.

00:26.500 --> 00:29.330
Okay, first of all,
you look magical and amazing,

00:29.360 --> 00:30.650
but I don't understand
what you're saying.

00:30.680 --> 00:32.750
So if you want to make it in this land,

00:32.790 --> 00:34.800
you really need to speak English.

00:34.830 --> 00:37.360
How's your first day of school?
It's grand.

00:37.380 --> 00:38.690
Hey, Irish.

00:40.220 --> 00:42.750
Wait. Other people can see you?

00:43.850 --> 00:45.560
But only because you let them see you.

00:45.580 --> 00:47.880
That's right.

00:47.910 --> 00:49.100
I've thought about it a lot,

00:49.160 --> 00:50.680
and I know what I want as my first wish.

00:50.720 --> 00:52.040
Your magical race,

00:52.070 --> 00:53.580
they make my favorite cereal,
Lucky Charms.

00:53.580 --> 00:54.970
I really wish that you

00:54.990 --> 00:56.670
would make me a box of Lucky Charms

00:56.780 --> 00:59.240
with all marshmallows. You're in luck.

00:59.250 --> 01:01.750
Lucky the Leprechaun
happens to be my cousin.

01:01.760 --> 01:04.150
And he lives two toadstools down.

01:04.180 --> 01:05.680
Thank you.

01:05.720 --> 01:07.700
Though I don't understand
most of what you just said.

01:09.140 --> 01:10.780
Work on it.

01:11.940 --> 01:12.950
Go back to Mexico.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.074

01:24.290 --> 01:25.720
Hello.

01:26.790 --> 01:28.810
Hi. We got you something.

01:32.650 --> 01:34.660
Concealer? To help with the bags.

01:34.700 --> 01:36.280
Don't get us wrong, Ms. Corcoran.

01:36.310 --> 01:37.620
I mean, you are still

01:37.650 --> 01:39.850
the most tappable teacher
at McKinley, by far.

01:39.880 --> 01:41.450
You've been looking tired.

01:41.490 --> 01:42.930
Which makes sense.
You're a single mother.

01:42.960 --> 01:45.050
You've relocated. You have a new job.

01:45.100 --> 01:46.500
It's no wonder you've
stopped working out.

01:46.530 --> 01:48.390
Let us babysit Beth
for a couple of hours,

01:48.440 --> 01:50.440
any night your choosing,
for some me time.

01:50.480 --> 01:52.400
Have you ever babysat before?

01:52.450 --> 01:54.460
Mmm. Ask Mr. Shue.

01:54.480 --> 01:55.630
We took care of

01:55.670 --> 01:56.940
his sister-in-law's three demon spawn,

01:57.040 --> 01:58.360
and they were practically purring

01:58.390 --> 02:00.550
by the end of the night.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.550
Please.

02:03.590 --> 02:06.550
You said you wanted us
to get to know Beth.

02:10.870 --> 02:12.610
I got a bee in my bonnet,

02:12.640 --> 02:15.040
and that bee's name is government waste.

02:15.070 --> 02:16.950
Earlier today, I saw a state employee

02:17.010 --> 02:19.460
in the person of one
Verna the lunch lady

02:19.490 --> 02:23.710
throw away 300 pounds of precious,
expired turkey gravy

02:23.740 --> 02:25.650
simply because Uncle Sam said

02:25.650 --> 02:27.550
there were too many weevils in it.

02:27.580 --> 02:31.090
Well, you know what has no
expiration date, voters?

02:31.120 --> 02:33.600
My rage.

02:33.620 --> 02:35.770
I have in my hand the budget

02:35.780 --> 02:38.370
<i>for the McKinley High production
of West Side Story,</i>

02:38.420 --> 02:42.330
a musical about a race war
that glorifies gang violence,

02:42.380 --> 02:45.460
yet still seems extraordinarily gay.

02:45.480 --> 02:48.460
This is a top secret document, Ohio,

02:48.470 --> 02:50.230
and we're opening it up tonight.

02:51.270 --> 02:54.100
$2,004, Ohio.

02:54.130 --> 02:57.270
That's a year's salary for a
public school math teacher

02:57.290 --> 02:59.770
wasted on fake switchblades

02:59.790 --> 03:02.660
and the soft packing
of teen dance belts.

03:02.680 --> 03:06.810
If this nation wants to impress
its future Chinese overlords,

03:06.840 --> 03:09.050
we need to get our priorities straight.

03:09.120 --> 03:11.990
And that's why I encourage every Ohioan

03:12.030 --> 03:15.150
to call McKinley High School
and sing them this song.

03:15.180 --> 03:17.370
"I'm fed up and angry, too,

03:17.410 --> 03:20.740
and I agree with Candidate Sue."

03:20.770 --> 03:24.150
And that's how Sue... sees it.

03:24.170 --> 03:25.670
McKinley High. Please hold.

03:25.710 --> 03:27.590
McKinley High. Please hold.
McKinley High. Please hold.

03:27.630 --> 03:29.060
You can't just cut the musal.

03:29.100 --> 03:31.890
Sue's pom-pom budget is $4,000 a month.

03:31.900 --> 03:34.050
Can't put a price on cheer, William.

03:34.070 --> 03:35.500
I really expected more from you, ggins.

03:35.530 --> 03:37.430
I thought you were a friend of the arts.

03:37.470 --> 03:40.540
William, I'm caught between
a rock and a different,

03:40.580 --> 03:41.740
yet equally hard, rock.

03:41.760 --> 03:42.880
Just this morning,

03:42.910 --> 03:45.580
I was assaulted in the parking lot.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.740
You! My son can't read,

03:47.760 --> 03:49.580
and you want him to sing and dance?

03:51.270 --> 03:53.690
The Clinton years are over.

03:53.730 --> 03:55.580
We're in a recession, William,

03:55.610 --> 03:57.710
that's about to double-dip
into a piping hot

03:57.740 --> 03:59.970
Crock-Pot of voter fury.

04:00.010 --> 04:02.090
And if this school doesn't
learn some priorities,

04:02.120 --> 04:03.580
well, come November,

04:03.610 --> 04:06.340
the voters will gladly teach you some.

04:07.620 --> 04:09.680
What if I can get the money myself?

04:09.720 --> 04:11.510
Ha. Good luck with that, William.

04:11.570 --> 04:13.600
The arts are going down.

04:13.630 --> 04:14.910
Today the musical,

04:14.940 --> 04:16.660
tomorrow the Glee Club.

04:16.850 --> 04:21.839
Next week, NPR and opera and
brunch and Tom Bergeron.

04:30.360 --> 04:31.770
Hi, Santana.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.670
How many solos did you get
in Glee Club last year?

04:33.690 --> 04:34.940
A few.

04:34.980 --> 04:36.340
"Valerie."

04:36.360 --> 04:37.710
And I loved it.

04:37.740 --> 04:40.070
<i>I was also the lips in Rocky Horror.</i>

04:40.130 --> 04:42.490
Listen, if you and I
were in Shelby's group,

04:42.520 --> 04:44.620
we'd get all the solos and the duets.

04:44.670 --> 04:46.630
Our voices sound amazing together.

04:46.680 --> 04:48.840
Plus, it's an all-girl group.

04:48.870 --> 04:50.590
Why would I care about all-girl?

04:50.650 --> 04:52.720
It's all lady power all the time.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.570
I mean, Shelby's a great teacher.

04:54.590 --> 04:56.980
I'm... I'm hitting notes I
didn't even know existed.

04:57.050 --> 05:00.050
She gets me-- what I have to give.

05:00.070 --> 05:01.580
It feels good.

05:01.610 --> 05:03.950
You know, honestly,
I wish I could, but...

05:04.010 --> 05:05.460
somebody's got to look out for Brittany.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.130
I mean, that special
place where she lives,

05:07.180 --> 05:08.670
yeah, it's beautiful, but...

05:08.720 --> 05:10.840
someone's got to help
her cross the street.

05:10.890 --> 05:13.190
I could never just leave her.

05:13.220 --> 05:15.640
Get her to come with you.

05:22.870 --> 05:24.520
You know what, girl Chang?

05:24.520 --> 05:27.290
If you cry every time
someone gets a hangnail,

05:27.480 --> 05:29.300
it kind of starts toose its effect.

05:29.330 --> 05:30.720
It's not a hangnail.

05:30.760 --> 05:33.070
Mercedes was one of
Glee's original members.

05:33.110 --> 05:35.310
I feel naked in here without her.
Yeah, well, get used to it,

05:35.490 --> 05:36.690
'cause without her singing for us,

05:36.690 --> 05:38.050
we're going to have to perform naked

05:38.060 --> 05:39.650
for the judges to vote
for us at Sectionals.

05:39.690 --> 05:42.170
No. I will not let this
setback crush our spirits.

05:42.210 --> 05:43.820
I mean, we have handled worse.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.290
Than losing one of our best singers?

05:45.330 --> 05:47.210
Kind of hard not to blame you, Mr. Shue.

05:47.210 --> 05:49.060
Think you were too hard
on her at Booty Camp.

05:49.060 --> 05:50.380
I blame Artie.

05:50.430 --> 05:52.270
Why couldn't you have just
given Maria to Mercedes?

05:52.310 --> 05:53.500
Because that would have damaged

05:53.510 --> 05:54.800
my integrity as an artist.

05:54.830 --> 05:56.220
Sorry I am late.

05:56.230 --> 05:57.440
I was putting up posters for my...

05:57.480 --> 05:58.730
for my campaign.

05:58.780 --> 06:00.520
Did you airbrush out your jowls?

06:00.530 --> 06:02.650
No. Look, let' stop it, everybody.

06:02.690 --> 06:03.990
So we lost a singer.

06:04.020 --> 06:05.630
So they canceled the musical.

06:05.660 --> 06:06.990
Wait, what? No, no, no, no.

06:07.020 --> 06:08.920
You can't cancel my musical.

06:08.970 --> 06:10.200
Sue cut the funding.

06:10.210 --> 06:11.250
The point is, right now, we shouldn't

06:11.300 --> 06:12.880
be turning on each other. I agree.

06:12.900 --> 06:15.020
I can only speak from my
experience with the Warblers,

06:15.060 --> 06:17.530
but no show choir is just
one person; it's a team.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.370
When we lost a Warbler,
we just replaced him with another one.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.700
Which is easy when your waiting
list has a waiting list.

06:22.730 --> 06:24.630
Dude, I know you're a big deal at Dalton

06:24.700 --> 06:26.880
or whatever, but we
don't wear blazers her

06:26.920 --> 06:29.840
so have a seat--
I'm trying to give a pep talk.

06:29.880 --> 06:30.850
Didn't you just say something about us

06:30.880 --> 06:31.860
not turning on each other?

06:31.890 --> 06:33.430
No, you can't cancel my musical.

06:33.460 --> 06:35.940
Okay? I was considering
changing my name to Maria.

06:35.980 --> 06:38.350
The musical is not canceled.

06:38.400 --> 06:41.080
As for Mercedes, yes,
that is a huge loss for us,

06:41.120 --> 06:43.280
but we will deal with
replacing her later.

06:43.290 --> 06:45.830
Right now, we need to focus
on putting on this musical.

06:45.880 --> 06:46.820
How?

06:46.880 --> 06:49.120
We sell ads in the program.

06:49.150 --> 06:50.390
I figure we can get ten,

06:50.430 --> 06:51.590
maybe 20 bucks apiece for them.

06:51.620 --> 06:54.060
So we'll only have to sell about 200.

06:54.090 --> 06:56.060
Well, I think it's a brilliant idea.

06:56.100 --> 06:58.080
And I volunteer myself
to spearhead the charge.

06:58.100 --> 07:00.100
It'll give me a great
opportunity to, uh, bust out

07:00.140 --> 07:01.330
<i>my Banana Republic Mad Men collection.</i>

07:01.360 --> 07:03.360
Okay. All right. Let's break off

07:03.420 --> 07:05.140
into smaller groups,
figure out who's going to canvass

07:05.170 --> 07:06.820
which parts of the city.
And guys, I don't care

07:06.830 --> 07:08.200
what Sue does or who leaves us--

07:08.260 --> 07:09.630
everyone in this group's dreams

07:09.660 --> 07:11.340
are going to come true this year.

07:11.370 --> 07:12.720
Let's do it. Hey, Santana.

07:12.760 --> 07:14.930
Ready to help out the team?

07:14.970 --> 07:16.880
Yeah, ofourse. Why?

07:16.940 --> 07:18.860
Just checking.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.680
Hey.

07:27.830 --> 07:30.110
Finn Hudson. You know who I am?

07:30.340 --> 07:32.520
I've seen you on YouTube,
losing Glee Club Nationals

07:32.560 --> 07:34.260
after tongue-kissing your
girlfriend for ten minutes.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.210
Uh... I'm a big, big fan.

07:36.230 --> 07:37.670
Thanks.

07:37.680 --> 07:38.810
At ease.

07:40.930 --> 07:44.270
So... who are you?
Me name's Rory Flanagan.

07:44.300 --> 07:46.280
I'm a foreign exchange
stent from Ireland.

07:46.310 --> 07:48.640
And I love everything about America,

07:48.680 --> 07:51.740
especially NASCAR,
your half-black president

07:51.760 --> 07:53.660
and Victoria's Secret catalogs.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.100
Yeah. Cool. Me, too.

07:55.140 --> 07:56.560
I'm staying at the home
of Brittany S. Pierce,

07:56.600 --> 07:59.340
and she thinks I'm a leprechaun.

07:59.350 --> 08:01.330
Yeah, she'kind of like
Rain Man with boobs.

08:01.380 --> 08:03.280
She said if I grant her three wishes,

08:03.330 --> 08:05.630
I can get into her pot of gold.

08:05.630 --> 08:07.060
So I'm pretending to be a leprechaun.

08:07.090 --> 08:09.720
Her first wish was for
an all-marshmallow box

08:09.760 --> 08:10.720
of Lucky Charms. Ah.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.050
I really want to snog her.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.640
I'm still a virgin.

08:13.750 --> 08:14.850
Have you made any friends yet?

08:14.850 --> 08:17.370
Not really, except for Brittany.

08:17.480 --> 08:18.640
I'm really lonely, you know?

08:18.660 --> 08:21.100
I thought America was all
about different unique people

08:21.140 --> 08:22.660
coming together and
accepting one another.

08:22.840 --> 08:24.460
That's a pretty old brochure, dude.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.160
I could really use some more friends.

08:27.270 --> 08:28.460
Would you be my friend, Finn?

08:28.500 --> 08:30.650
Whoa, whoa. It would be an honor.

08:30.680 --> 08:33.340
In America, dudes don't ask
dudes to be their friends.

08:33.460 --> 08:36.159
Except on Facebook, but even then,
it can take years.

08:40.730 --> 08:42.460
Okay.

08:42.600 --> 08:43.289
I'll be your friend.

08:43.380 --> 08:45.310
But first, you got to help me.

08:45.320 --> 08:47.660
One of the best singers in
Glee Club quit recently,

08:47.700 --> 08:49.430
and there's talk of more defections.

08:49.550 --> 08:51.530
You're staying at Brit's house, right?

08:51.560 --> 08:52.930
If you hear anything, let me know.

08:52.930 --> 08:54.760
I will. All right.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.540
Thanks. No problem.

08:56.560 --> 08:57.750
See you around.

08:57.810 --> 09:00.220
Finn Hudson-- that's Irish, right?

09:00.230 --> 09:02.420
Nah. Nah, my mom's from Toledo.

09:06.700 --> 09:08.600
Okay, uh, I got my iPod, my cell phone.

09:08.650 --> 09:09.690
You have my number?

09:09.720 --> 09:11.230
You wrote it on my hand.

09:11.240 --> 09:12.280
Okay. Okay.

09:12.340 --> 09:13.530
All right, honey. I'm going to go.

09:13.570 --> 09:15.070
I'll be back soon,
okay? Give Mama a kiss.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.080
If she gets upset, you just do a little

09:17.090 --> 09:18.340
"Itsy Bitsy Spider." She loves that.

09:18.380 --> 09:20.250
It's okay, boo-boo.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.430
It's okay.

09:21.470 --> 09:23.580
Mommy will be right back, okay?

09:25.370 --> 09:26.640
It's okay. She'll stop
as soon as I leave.

09:26.690 --> 09:28.200
I know she'll stop, okay?

09:28.230 --> 09:29.980
So don't worry. Thank you guys so much.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.610
Okay. I really appreciate it.

09:31.620 --> 09:32.890
Have a good run.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.800
"Itsy Bitsy Spider," guys. It's okay.

09:34.830 --> 09:36.760
Here. Let me take her.

09:36.790 --> 09:38.840
She likes me. (crying stop

09:38.890 --> 09:40.890
It's okay. Big Daddy's got you.

09:40.920 --> 09:42.970
What are you doing?

09:42.980 --> 09:45.060
Proving that Shelby is an unfit mother.

09:45.090 --> 09:47.630
First we plant the stuff,
then we call child services.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.170
Starting in the bathroom.

09:51.670 --> 09:53.320
Let's put you down.

09:54.620 --> 09:55.920
Baby botulism.

09:55.950 --> 09:58.680
Saw this lady on TV who
made her kid's forehead

09:58.720 --> 10:00.600
as smooth as his butt.

10:00.610 --> 10:02.970
People practically lynched her.

10:03.010 --> 10:04.530
You don't think she's going to notice?

10:04.560 --> 10:06.190
She's only sleeping four hours a night.

10:06.220 --> 10:08.610
She barely knows her name.

10:08.650 --> 10:11.360
Baby sacrifice makes me sad.

10:11.380 --> 10:13.520
What's wrong with Shelby eating Mexican?

10:13.540 --> 10:15.240
Is that, like, a boob milk thing?

10:15.310 --> 10:16.880
It's illegal to give
hot sauce to babies.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.300
This mom used to put a drop

10:18.330 --> 10:19.850
on her kid's tongue when he was bad.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.200
She went to jail for a year.

10:21.220 --> 10:23.350
Jail seems a little extreme.

10:23.380 --> 10:24.830
Shelby's a good mom.

10:24.860 --> 10:27.130
Do you want our baby back or not?

10:28.100 --> 10:29.610
Yeah, I do.

10:31.690 --> 10:33.000
Hey, Dad.

10:33.030 --> 10:34.910
I wanted to show you my program

10:34.930 --> 10:36.570
<i>for McKinley's production
of West Side Story.</i>

10:36.580 --> 10:39.520
It's inspired by my
favorite 1920s musicals.

10:39.540 --> 10:40.800
Sounds great, Kurt.

10:40.860 --> 10:43.470
Some reason you're showing
this to me right now?

10:43.520 --> 10:45.900
I was hoping that you
might be interested

10:45.930 --> 10:48.410
in purchasing some ad space
to help save the show.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.620
Save the show? We lost the funding.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.000
We're hoping to sell enough ad space

10:52.040 --> 10:53.240
to cover the cost of the show.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.580
They're only ten dollars each.

10:54.620 --> 10:56.460
And I've already talked to
the Lima Mortuary Society

10:56.470 --> 10:58.800
about buying a couple,
and we... we need about 200.

10:58.980 --> 11:00.770
You fund Sue's cheerleading squad,

11:00.810 --> 11:02.860
but you can't find a couple
grand for the musical?

11:02.910 --> 11:04.390
Figgins, allow me to introduce you

11:04.510 --> 11:07.290
to some friends of mine
down at the Rotary Club.

11:07.290 --> 11:08.800
These are the owners of
Lima's three funeral parlors.

11:08.840 --> 11:12.050
Well, strictly speaking,
mine is a pet funeral parlor.

11:12.050 --> 11:13.790
And mine is a crematorium.

11:13.820 --> 11:16.660
So we also bake and delir
delicious brick oven pizza.

11:16.780 --> 11:19.370
These three businessmen
wrote a check today

11:19.410 --> 11:22.430
<i>to fund West Side Story in completion,</i>

11:22.540 --> 11:23.780
and are now assured full-page ads

11:23.810 --> 11:25.030
in the program for the musical.

11:25.060 --> 11:26.680
I'm a big fan of the show,

11:26.700 --> 11:28.610
just because there are
so many deaths in it.

11:28.670 --> 11:30.550
So, Will, unless I'm mistaken,

11:30.580 --> 11:32.000
I think this means the show is back on.

11:32.030 --> 11:33.960
Burt, I think you're right.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.330
Gentlemen, thank you so much.

11:35.370 --> 11:36.870
Appreciate it. Really
appreciate your generosity.

11:36.890 --> 11:38.150
All right, thank you. Thank you.

11:38.170 --> 11:40.270
Burt, I can't thank you enough.

11:40.310 --> 11:42.060
Hey. Sue!

11:43.900 --> 11:46.350
Just thought I'd let you
know we got the money,

11:46.390 --> 11:47.530
so the musical's back on.

11:47.560 --> 11:49.580
Why, if it isn't Porcelain's dad,

11:49.620 --> 11:51.540
who may or may not have a baboon heart.

11:51.570 --> 11:53.180
I thought I smelled blue collar.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.920
Just so you know,
after the musical's done,

11:54.960 --> 11:57.150
I'm going to organize
as much money as I can

11:57.150 --> 11:58.550
to make sure you don't get elected.

11:58.590 --> 11:59.580
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:59.610 --> 12:00.890
Hold up there,

12:00.930 --> 12:02.230
cheese grits.

12:02.260 --> 12:04.520
<i>You mess with me, I will Temple of Doom</i>

12:04.630 --> 12:05.540
my fist throught

12:05.740 --> 12:08.040
and pull out your
still-pumping artificial heart

12:08.070 --> 12:10.210
which I will then hook up to my car,

12:10.240 --> 12:12.120
power us down to the
lumberjack convention

12:12.130 --> 12:15.140
for some deep discounts on the
Midwest's largest selection

12:15.170 --> 12:16.880
of ill-fitting flannels.

12:16.920 --> 12:18.600
Bullies don't have a
very good track record

12:18.630 --> 12:19.770
of messing with the Hummels.

12:19.810 --> 12:23.430
I heard, and I am
literally horny with fear.

12:23.460 --> 12:26.150
You know, you might want
to sneak a handful of

12:26.200 --> 12:27.440
Will Schuester's patented
Butter-Flavored Follicle Cream,

12:27.480 --> 12:28.670
put some on your melon.

12:28.690 --> 12:30.120
That way, you don't have to keep

12:30.160 --> 12:34.770
wearing those baseball caps that
are fooling absolutely no one.

12:37.830 --> 12:39.970
Don't know how she does it.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.140
I would just like to see
that woman lose, just once.

12:43.170 --> 12:46.280
No, Mummy, America's wonderful.

12:46.310 --> 12:48.860
I've made a ton of friends.

12:48.880 --> 12:51.380
No, I haven't met Colin Farrell yet, Ma.

12:55.380 --> 12:57.380
Mummy?

13:08.580 --> 13:11.370
One all-marshmallow box of
Lucky Charms, as requested.

13:11.410 --> 13:12.740
This is magic.

13:12.750 --> 13:13.750
Oh, my God.

13:13.790 --> 13:16.380
Thank you so much, Rory Leprechaun.

13:16.410 --> 13:17.710
You know, now you're only, like,

13:17.750 --> 13:20.260
two wishes away from
getting my pot of gold.

13:20.280 --> 13:21.940
I have another story to tell you.

13:21.970 --> 13:25.440
Every night, I feed Lord
Tubbington nougat and sprinkles,

13:25.450 --> 13:27.570
and then I rub his belly seven
times with glitter sticks,

13:27.610 --> 13:28.930
but so far nothing works.

13:28.950 --> 13:31.450
You do that because...?

13:31.460 --> 13:33.470
I want Lord Tubbington
to poop candy bars.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.820
What? Does everybody wish
for that or something?

13:36.820 --> 13:39.280
Brittany, I was wondering

13:39.310 --> 13:41.180
if maybe you'd like
to do dinner tonight?

13:41.210 --> 13:42.620
Oh, I can't.

13:42.650 --> 13:43.990
I have plans with a friend.

13:44.010 --> 13:45.310
And you're not supposed to eat anything

13:45.320 --> 13:47.580
but four-leaf clovers anyways, so...

13:47.610 --> 13:49.590
Thanks.

14:01.890 --> 14:05.770
** It's not that easy being green **

14:05.820 --> 14:12.030
** Having to spend each day
the color of the leaves **

14:12.040 --> 14:16.010
** When I think it could be nicer **

14:16.050 --> 14:19.710
** Being red or yellow or gold **

14:19.730 --> 14:23.550
** Or something much more
colorful like that **

14:25.610 --> 14:29.870
** It's not that easy being green **

14:29.900 --> 14:35.960
** It seems you blend in with
so many other ordinary things **

14:36.010 --> 14:39.010
** And people tend to pass you over **

14:39.050 --> 14:41.920
** 'Cause you're not standing
out like flashy sparkles **

14:41.940 --> 14:46.280
** In the water or stars in the sky **

14:49.380 --> 14:53.880
** But green's the color of spring **

14:53.920 --> 14:57.900
** And green can be cool
and friendly-like **

15:00.570 --> 15:04.910
** And green can be big like an ocean **

15:04.940 --> 15:10.920
** Or important like a
mountain or tall like a tree **

15:12.960 --> 15:17.680
** When green is all there is to be **

15:17.720 --> 15:20.980
** It could make you wonder **

15:21.010 --> 15:25.980
** But why wonder, why wonder? **

15:26.010 --> 15:29.460
** I'm green and it'll do fine **

15:29.490 --> 15:31.510
** And it's beautiful **

15:31.540 --> 15:36.160
** And I think it's what I want to be. **

15:40.230 --> 15:42.600
Brit.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.340
I want to talk about, um,

15:44.360 --> 15:46.420
you know, that thing
that we never talk about.

15:46.470 --> 15:47.900
What, that Sour Patch Kids are just

15:47.950 --> 15:49.120
Gummi Bears that turned to drugs?

15:49.160 --> 15:51.420
Are we dating, or what?

15:51.450 --> 15:52.920
Wait, isn't this a date?

15:52.920 --> 15:54.510
Aren't you paying?
'Cause I ordered shrimp.

15:54.560 --> 15:56.570
Wasn't last week when we
were taking a bath together,

15:56.610 --> 15:57.610
wasn't that a date?

15:59.400 --> 16:00.440
Are you crying?

16:00.460 --> 16:03.530
It's just that I'm really happy.

16:03.570 --> 16:05.450
Well, I told you last year

16:05.480 --> 16:07.470
that if I'm single and you're single,

16:07.660 --> 16:09.040
that we'd mingle.

16:09.090 --> 16:10.680
And if there's any
controversy that interferes

16:10.720 --> 16:12.730
with my presidential campaign,
then I'll use

16:12.920 --> 16:15.430
one of my leprechaun
wishes to win the election.

16:15.460 --> 16:18.740
You-You think that Great
Gazoo kid is a leprechaun?

16:18.740 --> 16:19.860
Well, yeah. Rory's from Ireland.

16:19.910 --> 16:21.320
That means he's, like, made of magic.

16:21.340 --> 16:23.000
Don't you have any wishes

16:23.030 --> 16:25.330
that you really,
really want to come true?

16:25.370 --> 16:28.090
Yeah, I do.

16:28.140 --> 16:30.170
I'm thinking of joining
Shelby's new show choir.

16:30.180 --> 16:32.050
If I did, would you join me?

16:32.160 --> 16:34.680
I'm so sick of always being
backup to Rachel Berry.

16:34.690 --> 16:38.820
I want to shine and be
seen as the star that I am.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.420
But I won't join without you.

16:40.460 --> 16:43.020
I don't really want to
be known as a quitter.

16:43.110 --> 16:45.240
Doesn't my presidential
campaign need continuity?

16:45.270 --> 16:47.340
Can I think about it for, like, a day?

16:47.380 --> 16:48.320
Yeah.

16:48.350 --> 16:49.880
No, totally. I understand.

16:49.910 --> 16:51.500
Yeah, just think about it.

16:51.540 --> 16:52.840
But in the meantime,

16:52.870 --> 16:54.890
I do have one more wish.

16:55.010 --> 16:56.050
Mm-hmm?

16:56.050 --> 16:57.920
I wish you'd hold my hand.

17:05.730 --> 17:07.730
But, like, under the napkin.

17:10.089 --> 17:11.560
<i>CK: Global warming is awesome.</i>

17:11.599 --> 17:13.920
<i>All those melting ice caps keep my
pool cleaning business open</i>

17:13.950 --> 17:15.440
<i>from March through Thanksgiving.</i>

17:15.490 --> 17:17.730
<i>I do my part by revving
my truck's engine</i>

17:17.780 --> 17:20.510
<i>every day and never getting
a smog check.</i>

17:20.540 --> 17:22.260
<i>Business is booming.</i>

17:22.290 --> 17:24.550
<i>I've gone from three pools to ten.</i>

17:24.589 --> 17:26.280
<i>I've even got an assistant now.</i>

17:26.310 --> 17:27.900
I found a quarter and a dead raccoon.

17:27.930 --> 17:29.430
Nice work, Pony.

17:29.460 --> 17:31.080
You can keep the raccoon.

17:31.120 --> 17:32.470
Thanks.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.280
<i>And then there's the ladies.</i>

17:34.310 --> 17:36.850
<i>I like them in all shapes and sizes.</i>

17:36.890 --> 17:39.560
<i>And, yeah, that sometimes
includes extra large.</i>

17:39.600 --> 17:43.920
<i>But what really makes my nipple
ring twitch are the cougars.</i>

17:43.950 --> 17:46.380
<i>That sun-kissed leathery skin means that</i>

17:46.430 --> 17:49.680
<i>they've done the nasty in all
sorts of exotic places</i>

17:49.720 --> 17:52.610
<i>like Florida or New Mexico.</i>

17:52.640 --> 17:53.980
Puck,

17:54.010 --> 17:55.860
why don't you ditch the kid

17:55.880 --> 17:57.380
and come on back?

17:57.400 --> 17:59.290
I need some help with a clogged pipe.

17:59.340 --> 18:01.350
Sure thing, Mrs. Figler.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.890
Oh, hey, did I show you
a picture of my baby?

18:03.930 --> 18:05.060
She's so cute.

18:05.060 --> 18:06.610
You know what?

18:06.660 --> 18:08.410
Why don't you just send Pony in?

18:10.450 --> 18:12.420
No problem.

18:12.450 --> 18:15.460
<i>Yeah, I live large and dream big.</i>

18:15.510 --> 18:17.430
<i>But the problem with dreams is
there's always some naysayer</i>

18:17.470 --> 18:19.220
<i>ready to crap all over them.</i>

18:19.250 --> 18:21.960
How many pools are there in Lima?

18:21.990 --> 18:24.550
I don't know-- 25, 30?

18:24.590 --> 18:27.620
You need to quit messing
around and get a real job.

18:27.650 --> 18:31.080
Do you have any idea how much
it costs to raise a child?

18:31.270 --> 18:33.480
I called Child Protective Services,
and they're backed up,

18:33.660 --> 18:35.920
but we should have our baby
back within, like. two weeks.

18:35.950 --> 18:38.150
Holy crap, I can't believe
you actually called them.

18:38.180 --> 18:39.840
Everybody has their big plans--

18:39.860 --> 18:41.640
colleges, New York,

18:41.670 --> 18:44.100
even you have your stupid
pool cleaning business.

18:44.150 --> 18:45.880
I mean, what do I have?

18:47.870 --> 18:50.130
Beth is perfect.

18:50.170 --> 18:53.570
She's my perfect thing.

18:53.580 --> 18:57.380
Something even I can't screw up.

18:57.410 --> 19:00.390
Do you know how hard it is
to do something perfectly?

19:03.460 --> 19:05.420
I'll never get the chance again.

19:07.590 --> 19:12.600
So even if I never leave this
town or accomplish anything...

19:14.210 --> 19:16.150
I'll have her to call mine.

19:19.620 --> 19:20.840
Puck. Hi.

19:20.890 --> 19:21.930
Hey.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.560
I was talking to my condo manager,

19:23.590 --> 19:25.240
and he's looking for a pool boy.

19:25.270 --> 19:27.740
It's an indoor pool,
so it could be a year-round job.

19:27.780 --> 19:30.090
If you're interested,
I could give you a card.

19:30.120 --> 19:31.130
Yeah.

19:31.160 --> 19:32.950
Thanks, Shelby.

19:32.990 --> 19:34.540
You're welcome.

19:36.690 --> 19:38.680
He knows about my leprechaun.

19:40.700 --> 19:43.350
Okay, everyone,
I have some very exciting news.

19:43.470 --> 19:46.540
Due to the collective spirit
of this club-- particularly

19:46.550 --> 19:50.220
the hard ad sales work of
Kurt and the generosity

19:50.230 --> 19:52.560
of the entire Hummel-Hudson household--

19:52.560 --> 19:54.930
it's my pleasure to announce
that we have raised the money

19:54.960 --> 19:56.610
<i>to do West Side Story this year.</i>

19:56.670 --> 19:57.880
All right!

19:57.910 --> 20:00.720
Good job, everyone. Great job.

20:00.750 --> 20:02.960
Thank you and thank you.

20:03.020 --> 20:04.950
Blaine, you actually had
something you wanted to say,

20:04.950 --> 20:06.950
right? Yes, did.

20:06.980 --> 20:08.620
I just wanted to acknowledge
that we've all had

20:08.650 --> 20:10.800
a really rough week,
what with Mercedes leaving.

20:10.840 --> 20:11.850
So I prepared a little something

20:12.050 --> 20:13.320
to show what Mr. Shue just said--

20:13.360 --> 20:15.350
that the magic is still here.

20:15.570 --> 20:17.100
So this is to remind us

20:17.170 --> 20:19.480
of what Glee is all about,
which is just fun.

20:27.840 --> 20:31.470
** There's a stranger in my bed,
there's a pounding in my head **

20:31.500 --> 20:36.020
** Glitter all over the room,
pink flamingos in the pool **

20:36.040 --> 20:39.830
** I smell like a minibar,
DJ's passed out in the yard **

20:39.860 --> 20:43.040
** Barbie's on the barbeque,
this a hickey or a bruise? **

20:43.060 --> 20:47.100
** Pictures of last
night ended up online **

20:47.160 --> 20:49.160
** I'm screwed **

20:49.190 --> 20:51.400
** Oh, well **

20:51.420 --> 20:54.040
** It's a blacked-out blur **

20:54.070 --> 20:56.390
** But I'm pretty sure it ruled **

20:56.420 --> 20:58.130
** Damn **

20:58.180 --> 20:59.600
** Last Friday night **

20:59.640 --> 21:01.280
** Yeah, we danced on tabletops **

21:01.320 --> 21:03.060
** And we took too many shots **

21:03.100 --> 21:05.320
** Think we kissed, but I forgot **

21:05.380 --> 21:07.300
** Last Friday night **

21:07.340 --> 21:09.960
** Yeah, we maxed our credit cards **

21:09.970 --> 21:12.010
** And got kicked out of the bar **

21:12.060 --> 21:14.850
** So we hit the boulevard,
last Friday night **

21:14.900 --> 21:19.340
** We went streaking in the park,
skinny-dipping ithe dark **

21:19.370 --> 21:22.630
** Then had a ménage à trois,
last Friday night **

21:22.660 --> 21:24.630
** Yeah, I think we broke the law **

21:24.660 --> 21:28.010
** Always say we're gonna stop, whoa **

21:28.040 --> 21:30.870
** This Friday night **

21:30.900 --> 21:34.750
** Do it all again **

21:36.220 --> 21:38.210
** This Friday night **

21:38.230 --> 21:42.700
** Do it all again **

21:42.730 --> 21:44.910
<i>** Do it all again **</i>

21:44.950 --> 21:48.880
** TGIF, TGIF **

21:48.920 --> 21:51.350
** TGIF, whoo! **

21:51.380 --> 21:52.930
** Last Friday night **

21:52.940 --> 21:57.400
** Yeah, we danced on tabletops
and we took too many shots **

21:57.430 --> 21:58.990
** Think we kissed but I forgot **

21:59.040 --> 22:01.420
** Last Friday night **

22:01.450 --> 22:03.050
** Yeah, we maxed our credit cards **

22:03.090 --> 22:04.570
** And got kicked out of the bar **

22:04.600 --> 22:07.150
** So we hit the boulevard **

22:07.190 --> 22:08.570
** Last Friday night **

22:08.600 --> 22:10.250
** We went streaking in the park **

22:10.270 --> 22:12.080
** Skinny-dipping in the dark **

22:12.120 --> 22:14.320
** Then had a ménage à trois **

22:14.340 --> 22:16.460
** Last Friday night **

22:16.490 --> 22:17.960
** Yeah, I think we broke the law **

22:18.000 --> 22:20.610
** Always say we're gonna stop **

22:20.650 --> 22:21.560
** Whoa **

22:21.610 --> 22:24.530
** This Friday night **

22:24.540 --> 22:28.550
** Do it all again. **

22:30.920 --> 22:32.150
You guys, that song is amazing.

22:32.170 --> 22:34.390
I think we should do it for Sectionals!

22:34.410 --> 22:37.220
So... no concerns about
showcasing any other voices

22:37.250 --> 22:38.290
this year at the competition?

22:38.440 --> 22:39.900
Oh, come on, Santana.

22:39.920 --> 22:41.390
You were featured last
year at Sectionals.

22:41.420 --> 22:43.210
Yeah, I know. And we won.

22:43.240 --> 22:45.390
Oh! No, you know what? I get it.

22:45.420 --> 22:47.440
Since Mercedes is gone this year,
it's going to be

22:47.480 --> 22:49.280
the Blaine and Rachel show.

22:49.290 --> 22:51.430
Yay! You all know it's true.

22:52.460 --> 22:54.970
Noted. Good to know.

22:55.010 --> 22:56.140
Thank you, Santana.

23:00.780 --> 23:03.070
Do not even think about talking

23:03.110 --> 23:04.320
for the next 30 seconds, okay?

23:04.330 --> 23:06.530
Nod so I know you understand me.

23:06.540 --> 23:08.650
Good. Here's the deal, Pixie-boy.

23:08.690 --> 23:10.310
You've got a crush on my girl Brittany.

23:10.340 --> 23:12.010
I understand.

23:12.040 --> 23:13.610
She's beautiful, she's innocent,

23:13.640 --> 23:14.940
she's everything that's good

23:14.990 --> 23:16.310
in this miserable,
stinking world-- do you agree?

23:16.350 --> 23:17.870
Nod. Good.

23:17.910 --> 23:19.700
Also, she thinks you're
a spritely, green

23:19.720 --> 23:21.230
mythological creature,

23:21.260 --> 23:22.670
but I know you're a potato-eating poser,

23:22.700 --> 23:25.020
but since Brittany likes
having a pet Irish,

23:25.050 --> 23:27.490
I'm not gonna explode you.
Here's what'gonna go down.

23:27.530 --> 23:29.660
<i>Leprechaun, starring a
young Jen Aniston,</i>

23:29.700 --> 23:32.200
is my favorite movie.
It learned me two things:

23:32.240 --> 23:33.430
1) leprechauns like fixing

23:33.620 --> 23:35.250
shoe buckles because they're gay.

23:35.300 --> 23:37.360
And 2) they grant wishes.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.820
So you're gonna grant me a wish.

23:57.450 --> 23:58.990
What are you doing?

23:59.020 --> 24:00.240
Nothing.

24:00.270 --> 24:02.140
What are you doing?

24:02.140 --> 24:04.490
Lord Tubbington snuck out,
and I found him at Arby's.

24:04.510 --> 24:07.300
How did you get into my room? I blinked.

24:07.330 --> 24:08.310
Look.

24:10.120 --> 24:11.500
I made your wish come true.

24:11.530 --> 24:13.290
Look.

24:13.320 --> 24:15.000
Oh, my God.

24:15.040 --> 24:17.000
Oh, my God! You did it, leprechaun!

24:17.040 --> 24:18.170
Yum.

24:18.210 --> 24:20.670
Which means...

24:20.720 --> 24:23.280
I'm just one wish away from
your pot of gold. Right?

24:23.300 --> 24:24.830
Yep.

24:24.830 --> 24:25.890
Cheers.

24:27.680 --> 24:29.850
Lord Tubbington's poops
are crispy and delicious.

24:29.880 --> 24:33.240
Brittany, I've got
something to tell you.

24:33.240 --> 24:35.380
You're not the only one who knows
about me. What do you mean?

24:35.490 --> 24:37.050
Santana found out about my secret,

24:37.120 --> 24:39.010
and she only had one wish.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.020
Okay, what was it?

24:42.130 --> 24:44.630
She wished for you to
leave the New Directions

24:44.660 --> 24:46.840
and join the all-new
girls' singing group.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.680
I don't know what to do.
I love the Glee Club,

24:51.700 --> 24:53.780
and I don't want to
abandon my friends, but...

24:53.860 --> 24:56.040
if you wish on a leprechaun,
it has to come true.

24:56.070 --> 24:59.810
And with just one wish,
it definitely has to come true.

24:59.850 --> 25:01.320
Why couldn't she have just wished for

25:01.350 --> 25:03.830
Lord Tubbington to quit smoking?

25:03.870 --> 25:06.900
That's it, then. I have to
leave the New Directions.

25:12.150 --> 25:13.180
Hey, Burt?

25:13.220 --> 25:14.540
Hey, Schuester.

25:14.580 --> 25:15.660
Hey.

25:15.690 --> 25:17.320
Finally came in to get
that muffler fixed?

25:17.350 --> 25:20.020
Uh, no. It's kind of my signature piece.

25:20.050 --> 25:21.370
Listen, I really want to

25:21.390 --> 25:23.010
thank you for what you
did for the musical.

25:23.040 --> 25:25.220
It's about time someone stood up to Sue.

25:25.220 --> 25:28.260
You came all the way down here to
tell me that? I got a phone, you know.

25:28.300 --> 25:32.050
You are an impressive guy, Burt.

25:32.090 --> 25:33.330
Sue is winning votes

25:33.370 --> 25:35.370
by feeding off all the
anger and the fear

25:35.400 --> 25:38.090
in the country right now.
What do you want, Schuester?

25:38.120 --> 25:40.310
Someone needs to run against her.

25:40.340 --> 25:41.840
Why don't you do it?

25:41.870 --> 25:43.810
Because I promised the
kids that I would be there

25:43.850 --> 25:45.010
for them all year.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.840
Besides, if an art
teacher runs against her

25:46.880 --> 25:48.900
it looks like I'm just
trying to protect my job.

25:48.930 --> 25:51.210
We need someone who is
a man of the people,

25:51.230 --> 25:53.230
a working man who voters can relate to.

25:53.270 --> 25:55.850
When that guy says the
arts are worth saving,

25:55.880 --> 25:57.480
people might listen.

25:57.560 --> 26:00.190
That guy sounds like a good dude.
I'd vote for him.

26:00.230 --> 26:02.960
I'm talking about you.

26:02.960 --> 26:05.280
I'm way ahead of you.

26:05.340 --> 26:07.690
I had Carole check out
the election rules.

26:07.730 --> 26:09.420
I'm too late to get on the ballot,

26:09.450 --> 26:11.240
but I can still run as
a write-in candidate.

26:11.360 --> 26:13.540
Yeah, some chick in Alaska won

26:13.570 --> 26:16.330
doing it last year. Her name was
way harder to spell than Hummel.

26:16.370 --> 26:17.670
Wait, are you serious?

26:17.710 --> 26:19.190
I mean, you--
you really want to do this?

26:19.220 --> 26:24.890
Your Glee Club saved my
kid's life. All right?

26:24.920 --> 26:28.930
I mean, turns out art
can do that, you know?

26:28.970 --> 26:30.710
And whether it's through
singing or dancing

26:30.750 --> 26:32.590
or painting a freaking picture...

26:32.630 --> 26:34.080
I want to be your campaign manager.

26:34.110 --> 26:35.780
Well, Kurt already claimed the gig,

26:35.790 --> 26:38.000
but I guess he's gonna need
some adult supervision, so...

26:38.000 --> 26:39.360
welcome aboard.

26:39.400 --> 26:40.680
That's right.

26:43.260 --> 26:45.140
SHELBY Okay.

26:45.190 --> 26:46.980
Co on, baby...

26:49.020 --> 26:50.970
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

26:51.030 --> 26:52.470
It's okay.

26:52.530 --> 26:55.530
There you go.

27:01.960 --> 27:03.370
Hold on, baby.

27:07.710 --> 27:09.530
What is it, Puck?

27:09.570 --> 27:12.600
Um, I justanted to come
by and say thank you,

27:12.630 --> 27:16.800
for recommending me for the
pool cleaning job. I got it.

27:16.840 --> 27:18.130
Oh. That's great.

27:19.300 --> 27:22.950
Not a lot of people
believe in me, and...

27:22.980 --> 27:24.630
Means a lot to me that you do.

27:25.630 --> 27:27.090
Okay, not a problem. Just...

27:27.120 --> 27:29.950
It's just really bad timing right now.

27:29.960 --> 27:31.950
Okay, baby.

27:31.960 --> 27:33.630
You mind if I utilize your commode?

27:33.640 --> 27:35.120
My tank's on full,
if you know what I mean.

27:35.130 --> 27:36.630
Okay.

27:47.420 --> 27:49.010
It's okay, baby.

27:49.060 --> 27:51.100
Okay, honey.

27:51.150 --> 27:53.180
All right. It's okay.

27:53.230 --> 27:56.730
I know. I know you're tired. I know.

27:56.800 --> 27:57.980
I know. You're so tired.

27:57.980 --> 28:00.350
Okay, honey. Okay.

28:00.410 --> 28:03.140
Okay, okay. No, no, no, Puck.

28:03.150 --> 28:05.020
You know, I, just,
I know you're trying to help,

28:05.080 --> 28:06.900
but I'm really overwhelmed right now,
could you just-just...

28:06.940 --> 28:09.250
you have to go, okay?

28:09.270 --> 28:10.450
She's really into me.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.870
Look. You'll see.

28:16.940 --> 28:20.810
** So long **

28:20.840 --> 28:23.350
** I've been looking too hard **

28:23.380 --> 28:26.330
** I've been waiting too long **

28:26.340 --> 28:28.700
** Sometimes I don't know **

28:28.760 --> 28:31.630
** What I will find **

28:31.670 --> 28:36.290
** I only know it's a matter of time **

28:36.320 --> 28:38.850
** When you love someone... **

28:45.280 --> 28:50.940
** Won't you tell me if I'm
coming on too strong? **

28:50.980 --> 28:55.680
** This heart of mine
has been hurt before **

28:55.690 --> 29:00.070
** This time I wanna be sure **

29:00.110 --> 29:02.320
** I've been waiting **

29:02.350 --> 29:05.860
** For a girl like you **

29:05.920 --> 29:10.220
** To come into my life **

29:10.240 --> 29:13.060
** I've been waiting **

29:13.130 --> 29:15.400
** For a girl like you **

29:15.430 --> 29:19.870
** And a love that will survive **

29:19.920 --> 29:22.250
** Yeah, waiting **

29:22.310 --> 29:25.130
** For a girl like you **

29:25.160 --> 29:30.370
** To come into my life... **

29:38.250 --> 29:40.670
It's everything I wanted.

29:40.700 --> 29:43.240
To be a mom.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.510
But...

29:47.550 --> 29:51.720
it's just so damn hard.

29:51.890 --> 29:53.760
Hard to do it alone.

29:53.820 --> 29:56.840
The mess, the stickiness,

29:56.880 --> 29:59.600
the... the crying...

29:59.640 --> 30:03.920
Books about ducks wearing
yellow rubber boots...

30:03.990 --> 30:06.380
it's all of it by myself, you know?

30:06.410 --> 30:09.160
But the hardest part
isn't any of that stuff.

30:09.260 --> 30:12.050
It's when the amazing things happen.

30:12.090 --> 30:15.050
It's when Beth first stood.

30:15.080 --> 30:19.250
I just wanted to be able
to look over, and...

30:19.250 --> 30:21.740
and share that moment with
someone that loves her

30:21.750 --> 30:24.180
just as much as I do.

30:26.290 --> 30:29.860
But... no one's there.

30:32.910 --> 30:34.540
Listen...

30:34.640 --> 30:37.190
If you ever need any help...

30:37.380 --> 30:39.590
I'm here for you.

30:40.700 --> 30:42.160
Always.

30:50.070 --> 30:53.390
Finn! I've got top-secret intel,
and you're not gonna like it.

30:55.600 --> 30:57.860
Is it true? No. Of course not.

30:57.930 --> 30:59.420
You're not leaving New Directions?

30:59.460 --> 31:01.170
Oh. I thought you were talking about

31:01.360 --> 31:02.570
the Selena Gomez pregnancy rumors.

31:02.610 --> 31:06.270
Uh... yes. I'm quitting Glee Club.
We need you!

31:06.310 --> 31:09.000
We're like a big family,
and this is our year to win it all!

31:09.030 --> 31:11.360
That's right, Double-Stuffed-
Fatty-Gassy-McGravPants.

31:11.380 --> 31:13.880
We are just one, big,
happy-happy family.

31:13.910 --> 31:14.910
Santana, stay out of this...

31:14.950 --> 31:17.000
You are such a
bacon-wrapped-bugeyed hypocrite.

31:17.030 --> 31:19.550
It's freaking hilarious how
jealous of Blaine you are.

31:19.580 --> 31:21.760
Every time he opens his
dreamboat acapella mouth,

31:21.760 --> 31:23.920
you're just itching to kick
him right in the Warblers.

31:23.940 --> 31:26.090
Brittany, we can't survive
any more defections.

31:26.120 --> 31:28.120
And I know you don't want to leave.

31:28.130 --> 31:29.540
No, I know. It's just that Santana,

31:29.580 --> 31:31.950
she made a wish on Rory my leprechaun...

31:31.960 --> 31:33.980
Brittany, there's no such
thing as leprechauns.

31:34.010 --> 31:36.570
And all that stuff about
Santa being real last year

31:36.610 --> 31:38.460
was cute, but this leprechaun crap?

31:38.490 --> 31:42.760
I mean, at some point you just gotta
grow up and stop being such an idiot.

31:44.750 --> 31:48.130
What did you just call me? Brittany,
I didn't mean it... like that...

31:48.130 --> 31:50.360
Yeah. All the guys in
Glee Club call me that.

31:50.390 --> 31:53.030
And you're the leader, so that
makes you the worst of them all.

31:53.070 --> 31:55.510
You cannot call your
future president an idiot.

31:55.540 --> 31:58.510
It's mean, it's bullying,
and I won't accept it.

32:03.690 --> 32:05.310
Hey, Mercedes, wait up!

32:05.360 --> 32:06.600
Whoo! Hey.

32:06.620 --> 32:09.330
Okay. So who else is in
this girl group besides us?

32:11.840 --> 32:13.530
Okay! All finished.

32:13.600 --> 32:15.590
You are nowhere near finished.

32:15.590 --> 32:18.690
You made me look 26.
I asked you to make me look 22.

32:18.730 --> 32:21.610
Uh, excuse me, sweetie.

32:21.630 --> 32:24.110
Susan, we have a problem.

32:24.230 --> 32:27.510
You're a candidate for office,
so campaign law says

32:27.550 --> 32:30.780
we have to give your new
opponent equal time.

32:30.910 --> 32:32.760
What new opponent?

32:34.160 --> 32:35.630
Hi, folks.

32:35.680 --> 32:37.950
My name is Burt Hummel,
and I want to be your congressman.

32:37.950 --> 32:40.520
Now, Sue Sylvester,
she's gotten a lot of mileage,

32:40.550 --> 32:42.460
coming on this show and
scaring you into thinking

32:42.500 --> 32:44.250
that a high school putting on a musical

32:44.280 --> 32:45.660
is the reason why your
neighbor's house got

32:45.700 --> 32:48.000
foreclosed on. Now,
what she doesn't tell you is how

32:48.050 --> 32:50.930
she spends twice the entire
McKinley High School Arts budget

32:50.960 --> 32:53.490
on things like leg-warmers
for her Cheerios.

32:53.500 --> 32:55.580
She wants you to think
that the arts are a luxury

32:55.620 --> 32:58.130
we just can't afford,
but she's got it backwards.

32:58.170 --> 33:01.140
You know, in this economy,
art, music, theatre, dance,

33:01.180 --> 33:02.890
these are things we
can't afford to lose.

33:02.960 --> 33:06.180
Now, Sue Sylvester thinks that
fostering a student's creativity

33:06.210 --> 33:07.690
is a waste of money.

33:07.720 --> 33:11.370
I think it's the way you invest
in this country's future.

33:11.540 --> 33:13.680
We all need to get creative.

33:13.740 --> 33:15.550
You got an idea how we can
boo jobs in this district?

33:15.580 --> 33:17.140
I want to hear it.

33:17.260 --> 33:20.930
You send it to Hummel Tires
and Lube-- Lima, Ohio.

33:20.960 --> 33:22.800
And if you think I'd make
a better representative

33:22.800 --> 33:25.470
for this community than Sue Sylvester,

33:25.470 --> 33:26.940
write in Burt Hummel.

33:26.970 --> 33:28.520
Just don't let Sue shortchae our kids.

33:28.560 --> 33:30.570
My name is Burt Hummel.

33:30.680 --> 33:32.450
And that's how I see it.

33:32.480 --> 33:34.090
Motta Mia.

33:34.130 --> 33:37.600
Tomato, To-Motta.

33:37.640 --> 33:38.980
Loco-Motta!

33:40.490 --> 33:43.130
Awesome, more back-up for me.

33:43.160 --> 33:46.390
Oh, okay, you know what?
I did not just leave one diva-driven

33:46.430 --> 33:47.850
Glee Club to join another.

33:47.880 --> 33:50.890
So let me write you a
reality check, Richie Bitch.

33:50.920 --> 33:53.580
I've seen what you can do,
and what you can do is

33:53.590 --> 33:57.550
stand in the back, sway,
and sing very, very quietly.

33:57.610 --> 34:02.800
I, um... just wanted to be
on the winning team for once

34:02.830 --> 34:05.130
Then turn down the 'tude,
and you will be.

34:05.150 --> 34:06.800
Ladies. Welcome.

34:06.820 --> 34:09.300
We were just brainstorming
names for our new group.

34:09.330 --> 34:11.199
Perfect. Hot Bitches.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.130
Or Hot Messes. Free Beer.

34:13.170 --> 34:16.340
Uh, okay, I was thinking
something that more captured

34:16.360 --> 34:19.860
our essence, sums up who we want to be,
who we really are.

34:19.880 --> 34:21.830
What we are is trouble
for the other groups.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.350
The Troubletones... I like it.

34:26.389 --> 34:27.570
That's good.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.120
I like that, too.

34:29.159 --> 34:31.760
** Tarzan and Jane were
swingin' on a vine **

34:31.790 --> 34:34.679
** Candyman, Candyman **

34:34.719 --> 34:37.360
** Sippin' from a bottle
of vodka double wine **

34:37.389 --> 34:39.710
** Sweet... sugar... candy man **

34:42.000 --> 34:45.760
** Hey, hey, yeah **

34:45.800 --> 34:48.610
** I met him out for
dinner on a Friday night **

34:48.610 --> 34:51.090
** He really had me
working up an appetite **

34:51.120 --> 34:54.000
** He had tattoos up and down his arm **

34:54.010 --> 34:56.699
** There's nothing more dangerous
than a boy with charm **

34:56.730 --> 34:59.690
** He's a one-stop shop,
kes the panties drop **

34:59.710 --> 35:02.510
** He's a sweet-talkin',
sugar-coated candy man **

35:02.540 --> 35:04.880
** Sweet... sugar... candy man **

35:04.900 --> 35:07.890
** He's a one-stop, gotcha-hot,
making all the panties drop **

35:07.910 --> 35:10.740
** Sweet... sugar... candy man **

35:10.760 --> 35:13.630
** He's a one-stop, got me hot,
making my... uhh-uhh **

35:13.690 --> 35:16.120
** Sweet... sugar... candy man **

35:16.150 --> 35:19.130
** He's a one-stop, get it while
it's hot, baby, don't stop **

35:19.160 --> 35:20.450
** Sweet... sugar... **

35:20.470 --> 35:24.800
** He had those lips like sugar cane **

35:24.820 --> 35:27.330
** Good things come for boys who wait **

35:27.360 --> 35:30.260
** He's a one-stop shop,
with a real big... uhh... **

35:30.290 --> 35:32.970
** He's a sweet-talkin',
sugar-coated candy man **

35:33.000 --> 35:34.530
** Hey **

35:34.560 --> 35:35.530
** Candy man **

35:37.320 --> 35:38.790
** Candy man **

35:38.830 --> 35:41.480
** Hey! Candy man **

35:43.200 --> 35:44.890
** Candy man! **

35:47.270 --> 35:49.600
Now that's what I'm talking about.

35:49.760 --> 35:52.280
Man, this is trouble.

35:52.420 --> 35:54.460
Big trouble.

35:56.100 --> 35:59.240
Seriously, Sectionals should just give
us the trophy; you know it's ours.

35:59.270 --> 36:00.360
Hey.

36:02.030 --> 36:05.080
I saw you guys perform,
and it was incredible.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.800
I don't want it to be this way, but...

36:07.860 --> 36:11.420
I understand. I just...
want what's best for all of you.

36:12.790 --> 36:15.620
Brit, I need to apologize.

36:15.660 --> 36:17.280
What I said wasn't cool.

36:17.280 --> 36:20.260
I don't want to ruin our friendship.

36:20.290 --> 36:22.300
Any of our friendships.

36:25.670 --> 36:27.660
I accept your apology.

36:27.680 --> 36:30.150
Thanks.

36:31.480 --> 36:34.650
Um... I guess I'll see you guys around.

36:34.670 --> 36:35.820
Okay. Bye.

36:35.830 --> 36:38.370
Bye, Finn.

36:38.430 --> 36:40.460
Be nice.

36:40.500 --> 36:42.330
Brittany, Brittany.

36:42.360 --> 36:44.640
Your third wish has come true.

36:44.680 --> 36:49.020
You wished that by quitting Glee Club,
you wouldn't hurt anyone's feelings,

36:49.030 --> 36:51.330
and Finn was all happy and smiling.

36:51.370 --> 36:53.000
So...

36:53.030 --> 36:54.680
I'm ready for my pot of gold.

36:54.710 --> 36:57.590
Okay, no, my wish didn't come true.

36:57.650 --> 37:00.490
He wasn't smiling because he was happy.

37:00.520 --> 37:02.820
He was heartbroken.

37:02.920 --> 37:05.460
Leprechauns don'exist;
I realize this now.

37:05.580 --> 37:07.910
It would be really cool if they did,
but they don't.

37:09.540 --> 37:13.880
Oh, I have one final wish, Leprechaun.

37:13.880 --> 37:17.090
Would you do this whole school a favor,
and just disappear?

37:23.290 --> 37:26.080
So, anyways, I know this
happened really fast, I figured

37:26.110 --> 37:28.140
you might have some questions.
I mean, I got some questions...

37:28.170 --> 37:30.480
Yeah. Um, if we win, what happens?

37:30.530 --> 37:31.930
Do we just move to Washington?

37:31.930 --> 37:33.960
Well, it'd be, you know,
maybe, half and half.

37:33.990 --> 37:36.410
But you know, Kurt's gonna
be in college and you know,

37:36.540 --> 37:38.950
you're gonna be...
technically an adult, too.

37:38.950 --> 37:43.820
You know, on a football
scholarship or... I don't know.

37:43.860 --> 37:46.690
I'm going to need a lot
of help at the tire shop.

37:46.890 --> 37:49.020
Like... running it?

37:49.040 --> 37:50.360
Only if that's something you want.

37:50.540 --> 37:53.480
This should be good for all of us,
not just for Burt and me.

37:53.670 --> 37:57.170
But for now, we need
to support your dad.

37:57.210 --> 37:58.550
Pretty quiet over there.

37:58.550 --> 38:02.470
I want you to do this, Dad.
But think about the stress.

38:02.580 --> 38:05.190
You were just in the hospital,
almost dead.

38:05.230 --> 38:07.560
And Sue's going to make your life
a living hell. I know she will.

38:07.580 --> 38:09.560
She's gonna have a field day with
this whole having a gay son thing.

38:09.590 --> 38:11.720
I'm proud of you, Kurt.
Don't care who knows it.

38:11.750 --> 38:14.260
And yeah. I almost died.

38:14.290 --> 38:16.560
But a thing like that makes you
really realize what matters.

38:16.600 --> 38:19.540
And when things are in the dumps like
this, you gotta stand up and fight.

38:19.750 --> 38:21.740
Right? You understand.
You taught me that.

38:21.770 --> 38:25.670
Well, I'm sorry to
interrupt family time.

38:25.730 --> 38:27.570
I just wanted to welcome
you to the race.

38:27.600 --> 38:30.800
And in celebration,
I brought you a Breadsticks classic:

38:30.840 --> 38:32.970
The Gutbuster Extreme.

38:32.980 --> 38:35.530
It's on me. You know,
I really need to thank you.

38:35.680 --> 38:38.510
Your Burt's Corner last night
was a real wake-up call.

38:38.540 --> 38:40.210
You know, I'd lost track of why

38:40.220 --> 38:41.690
I wanted to run in the first place.

38:41.730 --> 38:43.610
And it wasn't about the arts.

38:43.640 --> 38:44.980
It was about my sister.

38:45.010 --> 38:47.690
So... you... you're not
cutting the arts program?

38:47.720 --> 38:50.880
Sweet Porcelain, so naive.
Of course I'm cutting the arts.

38:50.950 --> 38:54.040
You know what public school program
is the first to go in a recession?

38:54.140 --> 38:55.500
Special Education.

38:55.540 --> 38:57.520
There are special needs
kids at McKinley,

38:57.550 --> 39:00.740
yet there's no special ed classes,
no special ed teacher.

39:00.780 --> 39:03.600
I think that might be a better
use of school funds than flying

39:03.640 --> 39:06.730
the Glee Club to New York
without a set list, only to lose

39:06.790 --> 39:09.560
at Nationals with a song they
made up the night before.

39:11.070 --> 39:12.560
Have a good aneurism.

39:15.090 --> 39:16.750
Anyone mind if I just dig in?

39:16.800 --> 39:19.430
Say U2's over-rated. Say it. Never!

39:19.460 --> 39:21.050
Hey! Leave him alone.

39:21.080 --> 39:23.610
Or what, Pigskin? You're
gonna run crying to Mr. Shue?

39:23.650 --> 39:24.890
Oh, I'm shakin'.

39:24.920 --> 39:26.900
No. Not Mr. Shue.

39:26.930 --> 39:28.710
Coach Beiste.

39:36.810 --> 39:39.690
Thanks, Finn Hudson.
I've got no reason to expect you

39:39.800 --> 39:42.300
to be nice to me after I
ruined your Glee Club.

39:42.310 --> 39:44.160
I get it. You were just
trying to make friends.

39:44.190 --> 39:49.130
I know it's not easy being the new kid
around school, not fitting in anywhere.

39:49.160 --> 39:53.160
And when no one stood up for you,
I should have stood up for you.

39:53.190 --> 39:56.530
Look, I'll tell you what:
I know you're not a leprechaun,

39:56.560 --> 39:59.690
so, I'll grant you a wish.

40:01.990 --> 40:05.460
Awful lot of empty chairs in here.
This is a disaster.

40:05.500 --> 40:08.540
This is not the way that senior year
of Glee Club was supposed to be.

40:08.550 --> 40:11.170
Look, guys, I know
this is gonna be hard.

40:11.210 --> 40:13.880
This isn't how I pictured
starting out this year, either.

40:13.920 --> 40:16.860
Then I guess we've got
our work cut out for us.

40:16.900 --> 40:18.730
What happens when the pope dies?

40:18.770 --> 40:19.710
Heaven, you'd think.

40:19.740 --> 40:21.580
You get a new pope.

40:21.590 --> 40:23.340
There's always new talent to be found.

40:23.380 --> 40:26.050
Always a new voice, right, Mr. Shue?

40:26.090 --> 40:28.260
Well, everybody,
I'd like to introduce my friend

40:28.270 --> 40:30.390
Rory Flanagan. He's interested
in joining Glee Club.

40:30.430 --> 40:31.740
Can this kid even sing?

40:31.780 --> 40:35.080
I sing at Mass every Sunday,
and I love American music.

40:35.120 --> 40:37.790
If you don't mind,
I'd like to dedicate this song

40:37.800 --> 40:40.230
to my family, who I miss so much.

40:46.520 --> 40:53.290
** It's time for us to part **

40:53.320 --> 40:59.440
** Yeah, it's best for us to part **

40:59.490 --> 41:04.460
** Oh, but I love you **

41:04.510 --> 41:07.530
** Ooh **

41:07.530 --> 41:11.270
** I love you **

41:13.670 --> 41:18.890
** Take care of yourself **

41:18.920 --> 41:24.280
** I'll miss you **

41:34.470 --> 41:40.220
** And no more tears to cry **

41:40.250 --> 41:45.060
** I'm out of good-byes **

41:45.090 --> 41:46.640
He's magical.

41:49.150 --> 41:54.950
** It's time for us to part **

41:54.990 --> 42:01.860
** Although it breaks my heart **

42:01.890 --> 42:06.400
** Oh, 'cause I love you **

42:06.450 --> 42:09.040
** Ooh **

42:09.040 --> 42:13.930
** I love you **

42:15.810 --> 42:20.740
** Take care of yourself **

42:20.780 --> 42:25.960
** Take care of yourself **

42:26.000 --> 42:30.930
** Take care of yourself **

42:31.130 --> 42:34.090
** I love you. **
