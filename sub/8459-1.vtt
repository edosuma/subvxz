00:44.153 --> 00:47.323
Between the years
when the oceans drank Atlantis

00:47.448 --> 00:50.534
and the rise of the sons of Arius,

00:50.659 --> 00:53.162
there was an age undreamed of,

00:53.287 --> 00:57.041
when shining kingdoms
lay spread across the world.

00:57.166 --> 01:01.504
Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian,
sword in hand.

01:01.629 --> 01:05.674
It is I, his chronicler,
who knows well his saga.

01:05.800 --> 01:09.386
Now, let me tell you of
the days of high adventure.

04:37.303 --> 04:40.681
- I think we made the merchant angry.
- Are you surprised?

04:40.806 --> 04:44.435
- But we didn't steal everything he had.
- We didn't have time.

05:39.406 --> 05:43.244
- Why aren't they trying to kill us?
- Maybe they want to capture us,

05:43.369 --> 05:46.038
then torture us to death.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.745
Conan, help!

07:56.627 --> 07:59.088
- Do you know who I am?
- Taramis.

07:59.547 --> 08:02.508
- Queen Taramis.
- Not my queen.

08:02.967 --> 08:06.637
You have a queen?
But you are a Cimmerian.

08:06.762 --> 08:09.348
The Cimmerians have no rulers.

08:09.473 --> 08:12.309
You're a barbarian.
You live free in the world.

08:12.435 --> 08:15.938
You owe allegiance to no one.
Is that not so?

08:16.313 --> 08:18.649
It is and it always will be.

08:18.774 --> 08:21.402
- What do you want?
- I need your help.

08:21.527 --> 08:23.571
- No.
- No?

08:23.696 --> 08:26.574
You don't know what I'd give you
if you help me.

08:26.699 --> 08:29.368
You have nothing that I want.

08:31.078 --> 08:34.914
You were praying, Conan.
What were you praying for?

08:39.336 --> 08:42.381
Look at the shrine.

08:42.506 --> 08:44.967
See what you were praying for.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.764
What is there, Conan?

08:49.889 --> 08:51.807
Think.

08:56.437 --> 08:59.732
Show me the desire in your deepest heart.

09:25.132 --> 09:28.969
- Valeria!
- Where is this Valeria?

09:29.470 --> 09:33.015
- With Crom.
- Your god.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.518
She sits by the side of my god.

09:39.188 --> 09:42.274
What I want, you cannot give me.

09:43.400 --> 09:46.612
- Yes, I can.
- You can bring back the dead?

09:47.154 --> 09:50.449
Do as I ask of you and I will.

09:54.578 --> 09:56.622
Wake.

10:00.793 --> 10:04.755
- And remember.
- Tell me what I must do.

10:05.965 --> 10:08.217
Soon.

10:46.964 --> 10:49.091
Conan! Look!

11:22.541 --> 11:25.211
Doesn't that animal look familiar?

11:27.463 --> 11:32.176
I think it does. I'm sorry about
what happened the last time.

11:45.564 --> 11:47.817
They love us!

12:46.625 --> 12:50.254
We will drink to Dagoth,
the dreaming god.

12:55.926 --> 13:00.347
- What do you want me to do for you?
- To bring back the woman you love?

13:00.473 --> 13:02.516
Yes.

13:04.935 --> 13:08.272
It is written in the scrolls of Skelos

13:08.397 --> 13:12.443
that a woman child born with a certain
mark must make a perilous journey.

13:12.568 --> 13:15.029
It is her destiny.

13:18.532 --> 13:21.368
My niece Jehnna has such a mark.

13:22.203 --> 13:25.790
- I want you to take her on that journey.
- To where?

13:25.915 --> 13:28.584
Jehnna will show you.

13:29.752 --> 13:33.964
From the day she was born,
she's been prepared for this.

13:34.090 --> 13:39.053
There is a key she must find,
a key only she can touch,

13:39.178 --> 13:42.723
as it was written in the scrolls of Skelos.

13:43.390 --> 13:47.186
- Where is it?
In a castle.

13:47.311 --> 13:51.190
- guarded?
- By a wizard called Toth-Amon.

13:51.649 --> 13:54.777
- By a wizard?
- That frightens you.

13:55.361 --> 13:57.696
You're afraid of magic.

13:58.614 --> 14:01.158
And you will have to deal with it.

14:02.827 --> 14:05.246
What good is a sword against sorcery?

14:05.371 --> 14:09.417
- Then you're afraid to go?
- No. I will find a way.

14:10.751 --> 14:14.130
- What does this key unlock?
- A treasure.

14:18.300 --> 14:21.470
A jewelled horn. Only she can procure it.

14:22.763 --> 14:25.224
Only she can lead you to it.

14:27.351 --> 14:31.105
And when she has it,
you'll bring her back to me.

14:32.314 --> 14:34.984
Then you will have your reward.

14:38.028 --> 14:42.908
We shall both have everything we want...
through magic.

14:44.326 --> 14:45.953
No!

14:47.997 --> 14:50.583
It's all right. Don't be afraid.

14:50.708 --> 14:54.795
- It's only a dream. It's only a dream.
- No, I saw...

14:54.920 --> 14:57.506
A dream. Only a dream.

14:57.631 --> 15:01.093
- Be still. Lie down.
I saw it.

15:02.470 --> 15:04.930
I saw it again.
- No, you saw nothing.

15:05.055 --> 15:07.725
A nightmare.
lmaginings out of excitement.

15:07.850 --> 15:09.810
go back to sleep.

15:09.935 --> 15:11.979
I saw it...

15:12.938 --> 15:14.690
I saw it.

15:14.815 --> 15:17.026
I did. I saw it.

15:17.151 --> 15:19.570
Tomorrow you start your journey.

15:19.695 --> 15:23.324
You'll need all your strength.
Your destiny is at hand.

15:25.534 --> 15:27.578
Sleep.

15:30.164 --> 15:32.166
Sleep.

15:33.250 --> 15:36.253
All our destinies are at hand,
even Conan's,

15:36.378 --> 15:40.299
- though he doesn't yet know it.
- We don't need him, my queen.

15:40.424 --> 15:45.638
I don't need the captain of the guard
to steal a key. That is a task for a thief.

15:45.763 --> 15:51.644
What I need you for is to see that this dear
child is returned safely to the palace

15:51.769 --> 15:55.439
with both the treasure
and her virginity intact.

15:55.898 --> 15:58.400
I will protect them both.

16:00.027 --> 16:04.907
You'd better, my friend, for she must be
a virgin when she's returned to me,

16:05.032 --> 16:08.494
so she can be properly sacrificed.

16:12.915 --> 16:15.167
One other thing, Bombaata.

16:15.292 --> 16:18.504
It is not wise to have the king of thieves
near the treasure.

16:18.629 --> 16:23.259
So when the key is in my niece's hand,
I want your sword in Conan's heart.

16:23.384 --> 16:27.430
Have the Elite guard follow. They will
strike at the right moment to help you.

16:27.555 --> 16:29.306
Conan must die.

16:39.108 --> 16:41.819
Do you think he's handsome?

16:43.154 --> 16:45.531
Very ugly.

16:45.656 --> 16:48.742
No, not him. Conan.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.539
Can't you judge for yourself?

16:53.664 --> 16:58.294
But how can I?
How many times have I seen a man?

16:58.627 --> 17:01.130
A real man.

17:01.672 --> 17:03.799
All I've seen is you.

17:08.304 --> 17:10.931
Meaning no insult to you, Bombaata.

17:11.723 --> 17:14.185
Yes. He is handsome.

17:53.974 --> 17:57.186
Conan, wait! We must go this way.

17:57.478 --> 18:00.564
- Not yet.
- But you have to obey me.

18:01.190 --> 18:04.735
Weren't you told?
There are rules to every game.

18:05.236 --> 18:07.780
I believe you.
But there's magic in this game

18:07.905 --> 18:10.950
and I have to be able
to fight it with magic.

18:11.075 --> 18:13.119
Akiro!

18:47.736 --> 18:50.156
Crom!

18:50.281 --> 18:53.117
- What are they going to do?
- Have lunch.

19:12.303 --> 19:16.056
Those savages should thank me,
sparing them a terrible stomachache.

19:16.182 --> 19:20.060
Why would they wanna eat someone
as old and as sour as you?

19:20.186 --> 19:24.482
They thought if they digested me,
my magic would be in their blood.

19:24.607 --> 19:27.359
At least they coulda washed you first.

19:49.673 --> 19:52.134
I need you.
- I'm yours.

20:02.228 --> 20:04.438
Tell me more about this key.

20:04.563 --> 20:07.817
Oh, it's not an ordinary key. It's a jewel.

20:07.942 --> 20:11.487
- A jewel?
- Yes. The Heart of Ahriman.

20:13.656 --> 20:17.284
- Well, can it be worn?
- Only by me.

20:17.410 --> 20:19.870
No one else dare touch it.

21:19.430 --> 21:23.350
lf there is anything here that you like,
try not to take it.

21:23.476 --> 21:26.604
I know when to steal and when not to.

21:54.590 --> 21:56.717
Hit her. get her!

21:56.842 --> 21:59.512
- What did she do?
- She came with bandits to raid us.

21:59.637 --> 22:02.264
The others are dead. Now it's her turn,

22:02.389 --> 22:04.934
after we have our fun with her.

22:06.227 --> 22:08.646
Don't kill her too soon!

22:08.771 --> 22:12.650
- Save her!
- Thieves should be hanged.

22:16.320 --> 22:19.698
Conan, there are six of them against her.

22:20.699 --> 22:24.537
One, two, three... I think you're right.

22:24.662 --> 22:27.248
And she's tied to the stake.

22:27.373 --> 22:29.834
Do something!

24:51.809 --> 24:54.061
Stop.

25:04.113 --> 25:07.199
I think we made a friend.
- Wait here.

25:28.387 --> 25:30.431
What do you want?

25:30.556 --> 25:32.850
- To come with you.
- Be off!

25:35.227 --> 25:39.523
- Let me speak to Conan.
I said be off.

26:49.927 --> 26:51.971
Stop!

26:56.475 --> 26:58.519
Leave.

26:59.770 --> 27:04.733
I swear that if Conan will let me ride
with him, I will give my life for him.

27:10.114 --> 27:12.366
We shall see.

27:49.570 --> 27:52.865
The castle of Toth-Amon. It holds the key.

28:09.048 --> 28:11.509
Come bring her, Conan.

28:14.845 --> 28:17.807
- We leave now.
In the morning.

28:20.309 --> 28:23.020
- I'm the leader here.
- Lead in the morning.

28:23.145 --> 28:25.898
It will be better. We must rest.

28:26.023 --> 28:28.275
My thinking exactly.

30:29.688 --> 30:31.941
Sleep.

30:34.235 --> 30:38.197
ln the morning you will touch
the Heart of Ahriman.

30:38.322 --> 30:41.033
The first to do so in a thousand years.

31:10.438 --> 31:12.481
Look!

31:17.361 --> 31:19.739
Jehnna... Jehnna!

31:21.949 --> 31:23.993
Jehnna!

31:32.918 --> 31:35.379
Akiro, where is she?

31:39.550 --> 31:41.719
ln there!

31:43.888 --> 31:46.932
- Who took her?
- A giant bird.

31:47.057 --> 31:49.935
A bird of smoke.

31:52.062 --> 31:54.315
lnto the boat!

31:55.483 --> 31:57.777
Somebody should stay
and watch the horses.

31:57.902 --> 31:59.862
Malak!

31:59.987 --> 32:02.448
I didn't mean me.

32:05.284 --> 32:07.745
I'm rowing!

32:37.399 --> 32:39.860
Too late, my friends.

32:40.903 --> 32:44.448
But come... come anyway.

33:40.129 --> 33:43.299
How do we get in?
Is there another entrance?

33:55.144 --> 33:57.938
Under here is a way in.

33:58.606 --> 34:02.693
- You mean under the water?
- You can stay here if you like.

34:06.155 --> 34:08.699
Alone?

34:29.719 --> 34:31.764
They need me.

37:03.582 --> 37:05.626
Bombaata.

38:53.734 --> 38:56.195
Wizard it open.

39:22.596 --> 39:26.308
Fine magician you are.
go back to juggling apples.

40:28.162 --> 40:29.955
get up! get him!

43:02.274 --> 43:05.778
That's exactly what I would have done.
Exactly.

43:49.947 --> 43:54.452
There are only two left, wizard,
and you're behind one of them.

43:55.619 --> 43:58.122
Which one?

43:58.414 --> 44:00.458
- No! Not here!
- It's us!

45:03.145 --> 45:05.189
Bombaata.

45:06.857 --> 45:08.109
Bombaata!

45:13.280 --> 45:14.573
Bombaata!

45:17.243 --> 45:18.869
Bombaata!

45:20.246 --> 45:22.456
I need you!

45:22.581 --> 45:24.875
Bombaata!

45:27.086 --> 45:29.755
- Bombaata...
- It's all right.

46:27.980 --> 46:30.024
Crom!

46:50.002 --> 46:52.838
Out! Out of here quick!

46:52.963 --> 46:55.466
- Hurry, hurry!
- Quick! Out!

47:43.347 --> 47:45.391
Bombaata!

48:04.660 --> 48:07.121
All an illusion.

48:42.948 --> 48:46.619
Help! Bombaata, help me!

48:46.911 --> 48:49.497
Bombaata, where are you?

48:49.622 --> 48:52.583
Put me down, do you hear me?
Put me down!

48:53.626 --> 48:55.669
Look out, you fool!

51:57.101 --> 51:59.353
Bombaata, stop!

52:02.106 --> 52:05.609
- Why?
I thought you were going to hurt the girl.

52:16.954 --> 52:19.415
This is one of the queen's guards.

52:19.540 --> 52:22.501
- Why did they attack us?
- Not by her order.

53:07.421 --> 53:12.384
Wait, wait. This is much better.
Akiro's own magic mixture.

53:13.219 --> 53:15.679
Let me help you.

53:40.830 --> 53:45.251
- What do you think you're doing?
- Covering your wound.

53:45.376 --> 53:47.670
My wound is lower.

53:47.795 --> 53:50.881
We don't want an infection to spread.

53:51.006 --> 53:53.217
I'll spread your head open.

53:58.347 --> 54:00.975
Is this what the world has come to?

54:01.600 --> 54:06.522
You try to help somebody
and what do you get instead of thanks?

54:07.773 --> 54:10.234
Threats.

54:21.203 --> 54:23.664
Now, yell if it hurts.

54:30.796 --> 54:33.257
I suppose nothing hurts you.

54:33.382 --> 54:35.634
Only pain.

54:36.844 --> 54:41.223
After we return to Shadizar,
what will you do?

54:42.683 --> 54:46.771
I'll find my kingdom
and a queen to sit beside me.

54:51.192 --> 54:53.319
What kingdom?

54:53.444 --> 54:56.447
The promise I was kingdomed.

54:56.947 --> 54:58.741
No...

54:58.866 --> 55:01.535
The kingdom I was promised.

55:08.334 --> 55:11.587
- What queen?
- Valeria.

55:15.966 --> 55:18.844
- Valeria...
- Valeria.

55:20.763 --> 55:25.226
What is she like, this... Valeria?

55:28.437 --> 55:31.190
Do you see this woman over there?

55:33.651 --> 55:36.487
- Zula?
- Valeria is like her.

55:37.696 --> 55:43.369
She doesn't look like her,
but she has the same... spirit.

55:45.287 --> 55:50.126
The same... The same...

55:50.251 --> 55:52.503
Strength?

55:53.504 --> 55:55.714
Strength. Strength.

55:55.840 --> 55:58.134
And she's a warrior too?

55:58.259 --> 56:00.719
A great warrior.

56:02.012 --> 56:04.056
A great woman.

56:04.181 --> 56:09.228
Could there ever be...
anyone else but her?

56:10.062 --> 56:12.273
Another queen?

56:12.857 --> 56:15.234
Lot on your knife.

56:17.361 --> 56:20.197
Not on your life.

56:25.703 --> 56:29.415
Excuse me. I must get up now.

56:49.894 --> 56:52.146
How do you feel?

56:53.064 --> 56:55.316
Welcome.

56:56.067 --> 56:58.861
You are welcome.

57:00.821 --> 57:03.616
I didn't know women could be warriors.

57:03.741 --> 57:06.118
All my tribe are warriors.

57:08.329 --> 57:11.332
Well, it seems that
men like women warriors.

57:11.457 --> 57:13.501
Some.

57:15.461 --> 57:18.464
Do you think that I could ever be one?

57:20.007 --> 57:22.676
I could teach you how to use this.

57:24.303 --> 57:27.515
Yes. Please.

57:31.477 --> 57:34.063
Now, the power is in the wrists.

57:34.188 --> 57:36.649
Oh, I see. Like this?

57:36.774 --> 57:40.653
That's right. They've got to stay loose.

57:40.778 --> 57:43.197
It takes practice and strength.

57:44.865 --> 57:46.200
Wait!

57:46.325 --> 57:48.994
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait!

57:50.496 --> 57:52.540
Hold on.

57:53.541 --> 57:58.421
lf you're going to learn how to fight,
then learn with a real weapon.

57:58.546 --> 58:00.923
Not with a toothpick.

58:02.091 --> 58:05.886
Here. I'll show you. Stand like this.

58:10.683 --> 58:13.394
Yes. You do it. Try it.

58:13.519 --> 58:15.896
And then swing it over your head.

58:17.523 --> 58:20.151
I'll help you. Swing over your head.

58:22.278 --> 58:24.321
good.

58:25.865 --> 58:28.951
Now you're ready to take on anybody.

58:53.684 --> 58:56.145
How do you attract a man?

58:57.480 --> 58:59.648
What I mean is...

58:59.774 --> 59:03.944
suppose you set your heart on somebody,

59:04.070 --> 59:06.197
what would you do to get him?

59:06.322 --> 59:09.116
grab him! And take him!

59:10.117 --> 59:13.162
You'd grab him and... and take him?

59:14.121 --> 59:17.249
Take him, like that!

59:25.466 --> 59:28.511
- What did she mean?
- What did she say?

59:28.886 --> 59:34.850
Well, she said that if she wanted a man,
she'd reach out and take him.

59:35.518 --> 59:37.686
good idea.

59:37.812 --> 59:43.484
But then what? I mean, you've got him.
What do you do with him?

59:44.110 --> 59:47.363
That's easy. You see, you just...

59:48.155 --> 59:50.199
You...

59:51.200 --> 59:55.579
You see, in order for a man
to really know a woman

59:57.039 --> 01:00:00.543
and for her to know him, they have to...

01:00:02.128 --> 01:00:04.797
they have to... to join.

01:00:06.424 --> 01:00:07.925
Join?

01:00:12.388 --> 01:00:14.265
get together.

01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:19.103
You see, he has to take his... his...

01:00:21.689 --> 01:00:23.649
and grab her by the...

01:00:26.026 --> 01:00:28.362
There you are, joined.

01:00:28.571 --> 01:00:30.990
I mean, how do you think flowers grow?

01:00:40.416 --> 01:00:43.586
- Through this?
- Yes.

01:00:43.711 --> 01:00:46.672
Is this the only way?
- Yes.

01:00:47.214 --> 01:00:51.385
- We can't go around it?
I go where I feel myself led.

01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:53.971
So I've noticed.

01:02:51.005 --> 01:02:53.257
That way.

01:04:21.262 --> 01:04:25.224
Shouldn't one of us
go back and stand guard?

01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:15.024
Bombaata.

01:05:18.027 --> 01:05:20.071
Together.

01:05:55.022 --> 01:05:57.483
Here, let me help.

01:06:00.111 --> 01:06:03.656
Malak, go inside and see if there's a lock.

01:06:03.781 --> 01:06:06.158
- You mean in there?
- go!

01:06:24.301 --> 01:06:27.596
I found something. Let go. Easy.

01:07:47.051 --> 01:07:50.346
''It is written in the scrolls of Skelos

01:07:50.471 --> 01:07:55.893
that the horn will be
found by a woman child.''

01:07:56.727 --> 01:08:01.774
''A virgin, who will have a mark upon her.''

01:08:13.953 --> 01:08:22.252
''And when the horn is placed once more
in the forehead of the dreaming god,

01:08:23.212 --> 01:08:25.589
Dagoth will arise.''

01:08:25.714 --> 01:08:29.343
''Then let men fear.''

01:08:30.176 --> 01:08:32.638
''Death to the world.''

01:08:35.890 --> 01:08:38.810
''The woman child will be sacrificed.''

01:09:17.975 --> 01:09:20.853
- Stop her!
- Be silent!

01:09:58.432 --> 01:10:00.476
Crom!

01:11:09.503 --> 01:11:11.964
Death to the world.

01:11:12.089 --> 01:11:14.550
Life for Valeria.

01:11:20.306 --> 01:11:23.142
The girl's destiny isn't only
to deliver the horn.

01:11:23.267 --> 01:11:25.686
It's just writing on a wall.

01:11:25.811 --> 01:11:28.647
She is to be killed. Sacrificed.

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:32.902
We shall see, destiny or not.

01:11:34.945 --> 01:11:37.323
Everybody out!

01:11:37.531 --> 01:11:39.575
Out!

01:11:40.868 --> 01:11:43.329
Wait! It's worth a fortune!

01:12:21.659 --> 01:12:25.037
- We come in peace.
- Then let us go in peace.

01:12:26.914 --> 01:12:31.752
Let the girl come forward.
We've been waiting for her all our lives.

01:12:32.962 --> 01:12:37.091
We are the keepers of the horn.
It belongs to us.

01:12:37.633 --> 01:12:39.510
No longer.

01:12:39.635 --> 01:12:41.929
- Who are you?
- Conan.

01:12:42.304 --> 01:12:44.765
I have heard of you.

01:12:53.065 --> 01:12:56.235
Do you know the legend
written on the wall of the crypt?

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:58.404
From the day of my birth.

01:12:58.529 --> 01:13:01.741
Then you know what will happen
if the horn is placed back

01:13:01.866 --> 01:13:04.702
in the forehead of Dagoth.

01:13:04.827 --> 01:13:07.037
The god will live again.

01:13:07.163 --> 01:13:13.294
And we who give him life will stand by his
right hand and rule the world with him.

01:13:13.419 --> 01:13:17.715
You will die in the great evil
that will come from his rebirth!

01:13:18.090 --> 01:13:22.052
- We will control him.
- No one is able to control him!

01:13:22.428 --> 01:13:25.681
His power and his evil are too great!

01:13:25.806 --> 01:13:28.184
give us the girl or we'll take her!

01:13:28.309 --> 01:13:30.561
Enough talk!

01:14:00.382 --> 01:14:02.718
Back to the crypt!

01:14:53.018 --> 01:14:55.271
Bombaata, get out!

01:14:56.522 --> 01:14:58.774
Out! Let's get out of here!

01:15:34.268 --> 01:15:38.314
Behind the dragon there's a tunnel.
It could be our only way out.

01:15:38.439 --> 01:15:40.691
The jewel. Take the jewel.

01:15:41.650 --> 01:15:44.028
Hurry, hurry.

01:15:48.115 --> 01:15:50.159
That way.

01:15:55.831 --> 01:15:59.835
Malak! Malak, come on!

01:16:04.090 --> 01:16:05.382
Malak!

01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:40.251
It's the leader. He's a wizard.

01:16:50.302 --> 01:16:55.433
- He's forcing the mouth open.
- Well, stop him. Kill him or something.

01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:02.022
- My dagger is gone. You kill him.
- Not me. It's bad luck to kill a wizard.

01:17:02.148 --> 01:17:06.360
Wait. There is a better way
to take care of a wizard.

01:17:40.186 --> 01:17:42.438
Well done, Akiro.

01:17:43.481 --> 01:17:45.733
lnto the tunnel.

01:18:00.748 --> 01:18:03.667
Don't stop. Hurry! Hurry!

01:19:48.856 --> 01:19:51.108
Run! Run!

01:19:58.491 --> 01:20:02.620
- Where are the others?
- They're coming. Don't worry. go!

01:20:40.908 --> 01:20:43.369
- They've gone.
- Taken their horses.

01:20:43.494 --> 01:20:45.621
Or been captured. Let's flee.

01:20:45.746 --> 01:20:48.165
Wait.

01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:50.751
Bombaata took her.

01:20:52.545 --> 01:20:55.339
Taramis planned it from the beginning.

01:20:55.464 --> 01:20:59.552
We get the horn, her guards will kill us,

01:20:59.677 --> 01:21:02.847
and Bombaata takes the girl
and the horn back to her.

01:21:02.972 --> 01:21:07.435
- And her promise to you?
- A lie.

01:21:13.899 --> 01:21:17.737
- Where are we going?
- To Shadizar.

01:21:17.862 --> 01:21:20.948
- What for?
- To stop Jehnna's sacrifice.

01:21:21.073 --> 01:21:24.952
But it's her destiny. It can't be stopped.

01:21:25.077 --> 01:21:27.621
- You don't have to come.
I will.

01:21:27.747 --> 01:21:30.207
I will.
I won't!

01:21:30.332 --> 01:21:32.793
I mean, what's in it for us?

01:21:34.086 --> 01:21:38.174
What are we? Some charitable
institution? We're thieves!

01:21:38.299 --> 01:21:40.760
go! I won't help!

01:21:51.312 --> 01:21:53.147
Hey!

01:21:53.272 --> 01:21:57.401
Hey, wait for me!
You know you can't do without me!

01:21:58.110 --> 01:22:00.154
Wait, Conan, wait!

01:22:21.884 --> 01:22:24.345
Do you have the treasure?

01:22:36.732 --> 01:22:38.984
Bring it to me.

01:22:57.711 --> 01:22:59.755
Reserves to guard the palace.

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:03.718
There must be hundreds of them
around it. We can't get in there.

01:23:03.843 --> 01:23:06.303
Well, you can't say we didn't try.

01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:12.143
- The front gate can't be the only way in.
- Oh, it isn't...

01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:14.228
Malak?

01:23:24.947 --> 01:23:28.284
At the bottom, behind the waterfall,
there's an entrance.

01:23:28.409 --> 01:23:32.288
It used to be an exit. My cousin's sister's
brother dug his way out there,

01:23:32.413 --> 01:23:35.458
when he was a prisoner in Shadizar.

01:23:57.271 --> 01:24:01.609
Today is your birthday.
All of Shadizar is celebrating.

01:24:03.194 --> 01:24:05.237
Drink.

01:24:09.533 --> 01:24:12.328
To life. To Dagoth.

01:24:12.953 --> 01:24:15.206
To Dagoth.

01:24:48.739 --> 01:24:52.243
Oh, Dagoth, god of gods.

01:25:01.335 --> 01:25:05.089
My cousin's sister's brother
never said anything about bars.

01:25:05.214 --> 01:25:07.174
How do we get back up?

01:25:07.299 --> 01:25:11.512
The bars were put up after
your sister's brother's cousin escaped!

01:25:11.637 --> 01:25:15.516
Cousin's sister's brother. How many
times do I have to tell you that?

01:25:15.641 --> 01:25:20.396
- You said your sister's brother's cousin!
- Who cares who it is?

01:25:20.521 --> 01:25:23.107
What difference does it make?

01:25:49.175 --> 01:25:53.596
At the first sign of life in our god,
the girl must be sacrificed.

01:25:53.721 --> 01:25:58.434
Or, as the scrolls of Skelos say,
a catastrophe will befall us.

01:26:44.522 --> 01:26:48.359
Oh, Dagoth, god of gods.

01:26:48.484 --> 01:26:50.986
Power above all power.

01:28:41.055 --> 01:28:43.307
Kill her!

01:28:45.101 --> 01:28:47.353
Save the girl!

01:29:33.733 --> 01:29:37.027
Kill her! Kill her! She must be sacrificed.

01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:18.444
No!

01:30:36.962 --> 01:30:39.006
get back!

01:31:00.027 --> 01:31:02.530
Down the steps!

01:31:39.608 --> 01:31:41.652
No!

01:32:03.299 --> 01:32:04.717
Run!

01:32:44.715 --> 01:32:49.136
His horn is his life! Tear out the horn!

01:35:00.810 --> 01:35:02.853
Zula.

01:35:14.532 --> 01:35:17.159
I need a captain of the guards.

01:35:17.284 --> 01:35:21.038
I see no reason why a woman
wouldn't do as well as a man.

01:35:38.055 --> 01:35:40.850
- You.
- Me?

01:35:40.975 --> 01:35:43.227
Come here.

01:35:49.275 --> 01:35:52.653
I understand that every king or queen
must have a fool.

01:35:56.282 --> 01:35:59.660
- Do I qualify?
- More than qualify.

01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:15.509
Will the world's greatest
wizard come forward, please?

01:36:20.014 --> 01:36:22.266
At your service.

01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:27.063
One cannot rule without wisdom.

01:36:27.188 --> 01:36:30.816
- Let me instruct you in the fine art of...
- Later.

01:37:02.681 --> 01:37:05.309
Rule Shadizar with me.

01:37:05.434 --> 01:37:08.979
I will have my own kingdom,
my own queen.

01:37:54.233 --> 01:37:58.487
So it was that Conan
mourned his lost Valeria.

01:37:58.988 --> 01:38:02.283
At length, he sought adventure
in distant lands

01:38:02.408 --> 01:38:08.330
and trod the jewelled thrones of
the earth beneath his sandalled feet,

01:38:08.456 --> 01:38:12.918
until at last he found his own Kingdom

01:38:13.044 --> 01:38:16.338
and wore his crown
upon a troubled brow.
