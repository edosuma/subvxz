00:37.913 --> 00:39.498
Yes?
Oh, hello, boys.

00:39.623 --> 00:41.000
Hello, sir.
South Park Junior Detectives.

00:41.125 --> 00:42.501
We were wondering
if you have any crimes

00:42.626 --> 00:43.669
you need solved for a dollar.

00:43.794 --> 00:45.087
Ooh, little crime stoppers,
huh?

00:45.212 --> 00:46.797
Well, I'm afraid I don't have
any crimes

00:46.922 --> 00:48.340
I need solved right now.

00:48.466 --> 00:49.216
Aw, shit.

00:49.341 --> 00:51.510
All right, sir. Well, please
call us if you need anything.

00:51.635 --> 00:53.512
I'll do that.
Have fun, boys.

00:53.637 --> 00:54.722
Stupid assholes.

00:54.847 --> 00:56.307
How come nobody has a crime
to solve?

00:56.432 --> 00:58.809
Maybe starting a detective club
isn't such a great idea.

00:58.934 --> 01:00.644
It's a great idea. We just have
to keep working at it.

01:03.898 --> 01:05.775
Oh, hello there, boys!

01:05.900 --> 01:07.485
Hello, ma'am. We're detectives
with the South Park Crime Unit.

01:07.610 --> 01:09.320
Do you have any crimes
you need solved for a dollar?

01:09.445 --> 01:11.155
Ooh.
Neighborhood detectives, huh?

01:11.280 --> 01:12.865
Well, let me th--
Ooh, yes!

01:12.990 --> 01:14.867
There is something!
- Really?

01:14.992 --> 01:17.787
Yes -- two days ago, I put
a fresh-baked cherry pie

01:17.912 --> 01:19.622
out on my windowsill to cool.

01:19.747 --> 01:22.333
And later, when I went
to get it, it was gone.

01:22.458 --> 01:23.501
My God.

01:23.626 --> 01:25.419
Have you reported this
to any other authorities?

01:25.544 --> 01:28.380
No, but I think it's
a perfect case for you kids.

01:28.506 --> 01:30.049
Cool! We'll see what
we can find, ma'am!

01:30.174 --> 01:32.009
We're on the case.

01:32.134 --> 01:34.053
What have you got, Marsh?

01:34.178 --> 01:36.097
Detective McCormick found
something interesting.

01:40.309 --> 01:42.186
Jesus.
We're too late.

01:42.311 --> 01:44.688
I think we can piece
this case together now.

01:46.482 --> 01:47.775
Seen for the first time
on HBC...

01:47.900 --> 01:51.153
My pie tin! Ooh, but what
happened to the pie?

01:51.278 --> 01:52.446
Well, we've all
talked it through,

01:52.571 --> 01:53.864
and we've come up with a theory.

01:53.989 --> 01:55.991
What do you think happened,
little detectives?

01:56.117 --> 01:57.618
You said you set the pie
on the windowsill,

01:57.743 --> 02:00.162
where it must have sat
for some time.

02:00.287 --> 02:04.083
But its sweet smell attracted
the attention of somebody.

02:04.208 --> 02:05.501
Your husband!

02:05.626 --> 02:06.961
He wanted that pie badly,

02:07.086 --> 02:09.338
but he knew that he was
not allowed to eat it yet.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.340
Slowly, the rage built
inside his mind.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.175
"Why won't she let me eat
that pie?

02:13.300 --> 02:15.302
Why does she always stop me
from doing what I want to do?"

02:15.427 --> 02:18.389
His only solution became
obvious -- kill her.

02:18.514 --> 02:19.807
His plan was to use a hammer.

02:19.932 --> 02:22.309
Bash, bash, bash your
skull in, causing instant death.

02:22.434 --> 02:24.311
To make it impossible
for police to identify the body,

02:24.436 --> 02:25.980
he would use a shovel
to remove your head...

02:26.105 --> 02:28.399
Then saw off the arms and legs.

02:28.524 --> 02:31.152
The torso,
he would dump into the lake.

02:31.277 --> 02:32.695
The arms and legs,
he would dissolve

02:32.820 --> 02:33.946
with acid and lye
in the bathtub.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.365
And then, finally,
he'd be able to eat that pie.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.617
But before he could
go through with his entire plan,

02:38.742 --> 02:40.828
he discovered that the pie
had already been eaten --

02:40.953 --> 02:42.538
by your dog.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.124
Looks like the game is over,
old man!

02:45.749 --> 02:47.084
Oh my God!

02:47.209 --> 02:49.712
What kind of television
have you kids been watching?

02:49.837 --> 02:51.172
Just the news.

02:51.297 --> 02:54.466
All right, all right.
You -- You boys run along now!

02:54.592 --> 02:56.427
Hey, you owe us a dollar, lady!

02:56.552 --> 02:57.928
Fine! Here!
Just go!

02:58.846 --> 03:01.098
Wow! Look, you guys!
Our first dollar!

03:01.223 --> 03:02.850
We're in business.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.857
Kenny, you got the F.A.G.
on that perp in Washington?

03:09.982 --> 03:12.109
Boys, you have a little visitor.

03:12.234 --> 03:15.070
Is this
the South Park Crime Unit?

03:15.196 --> 03:16.363
Oh!

03:16.488 --> 03:17.531
Yes, it is!

03:17.656 --> 03:19.491
I lost my dolly.

03:19.617 --> 03:21.744
Thank you, Miss secretary.
That will be all.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.412
And get us some more cookies
and coffee!

03:23.537 --> 03:25.080
We're not paying you
to sit on your ass!

03:25.206 --> 03:26.707
Do you know
where your doll is?

03:26.832 --> 03:29.835
If I knew where it was,
it wouldn't be lost.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.587
All right, Sarah.
Come over here.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.422
I want you to describe
what the doll looks like

03:33.547 --> 03:35.090
to our sketch artist, Kenny.

03:35.216 --> 03:38.302
She has curly blond hair...

03:38.427 --> 03:40.387
and a red dress...

03:40.512 --> 03:42.973
and a turned-up nose.

03:43.098 --> 03:45.309
And a blue bow in her hair.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.520
You got it, Ken?

03:48.646 --> 03:49.730
All right.
Let's see.

03:50.481 --> 03:52.274
Damn it, Kenny!
That's not what she said!

03:52.399 --> 03:53.651
Put that away, dude.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.073
Don't worry, ma'am.
We'll find your doll.

04:02.243 --> 04:03.619
No sign of forced entry.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.204
But the window isn't locked.

04:05.329 --> 04:07.998
Right, so it's possible
the thief sat out in that tree.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.750
He would have watched Sarah
with her doll,

04:09.875 --> 04:12.253
possibly while cutting the palms
of his hand with a large knife.

04:12.378 --> 04:13.671
The pain gave him sick pleasure.

04:13.796 --> 04:15.422
Disposing of the doll
wouldn't be easy.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.549
He would've brought a shovel
to decapitate it.

04:17.675 --> 04:18.968
We're going to need
semen samples

04:19.093 --> 04:20.261
from everything in this room.

04:20.386 --> 04:22.221
All right.
Let's do this by the books.

04:22.346 --> 04:24.556
O'Donnell, get me smears of all
the places the doll used to be.

04:24.682 --> 04:26.600
Mitchell, run a tap
on the phone.

04:26.725 --> 04:28.227
Hey, kid, what are you doing?

04:28.352 --> 04:30.646
Agent Tucker, FBI.
And you?

04:30.771 --> 04:31.647
Detective Marsh.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.524
I'm in charge
of this investigation.

04:33.649 --> 04:35.025
Not anymore you're not.

04:35.150 --> 04:37.152
Hey, this is our case.
You can't come in and take over.

04:37.278 --> 04:38.112
Can't we?

04:38.237 --> 04:40.656
You guys are playing detectives.
We're playing FBI.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.366
That gives us jurisdiction
over you.

04:42.491 --> 04:43.617
Aw, crap!

04:43.742 --> 04:45.286
I want choppers on the roof
ready to go.

04:45.411 --> 04:47.413
Dude, we've been working
this case since 2:30.

04:47.538 --> 04:50.499
Good. Then you can help us by
telling me everything you know.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.168
Son of a bitch.
Stupid FBI.

04:53.294 --> 04:55.462
Well, I guess we can go back
to playing laundromat.

04:55.587 --> 04:57.298
No, we're not gonna stop
playing detectives.

04:57.423 --> 04:59.842
We've just got to find that doll
before those FBI guys do.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.593
Mrph.
- Yeah, but how?

05:01.719 --> 05:02.886
We're gonna have to start
bringing in people

05:03.012 --> 05:04.054
for questioning.
- Right.

05:04.179 --> 05:06.515
And I think I know
exactly where to start.

05:08.851 --> 05:10.519
Where were you this morning
at 9:00, Butters?

05:10.644 --> 05:11.562
I was at home.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.314
Your story is full of holes,
and I'm gonna beat your ass

05:13.439 --> 05:14.565
if you don't start telling
the truth.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.650
Mrph, rmhmhm rm mrph rmh.

05:16.775 --> 05:18.444
Mrph rmhmhm rm, rmh.

05:18.569 --> 05:21.030
They've really gotten good
at this good-cop, bad-cop thing.

05:21.155 --> 05:22.865
You're going down, Butters.
You hear me?!

05:22.990 --> 05:25.534
Mrph, rmh mrph rm.
Mrph rmhmhm rm.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.578
You're a worthless two-dollar
criminal, and you're lying!

05:27.703 --> 05:29.872
Mrph, rmhmhm rm
mrph rmh.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.416
I don't have nothing to confess.
Honestly!

05:32.541 --> 05:33.250
Fine.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.753
Then you won't mind giving us
a semen sample.

05:35.878 --> 05:36.962
How do I do that?

05:37.087 --> 05:38.380
You make the semen
come out of your body

05:38.505 --> 05:39.423
and put it in this cup!

05:39.548 --> 05:41.216
How do I make semen
come out of my body?

05:41.342 --> 05:42.217
Stop playing games!

05:42.343 --> 05:43.886
I'm not playing.
I really don't know.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.637
That does it.
Wait right here!

05:47.431 --> 05:48.974
You guys, did you hear that?

05:49.099 --> 05:50.059
Butters doesn't know

05:50.184 --> 05:52.019
how you make semen come out
of your body.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.771
How <i>do</i> you make semen
come out?

05:53.896 --> 05:55.647
I don't know.
I was hoping you guys did.

05:55.773 --> 05:57.024
It's that thing we learned about
in school

05:57.149 --> 05:58.817
where you pull on your wiener
until white stuff comes out.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.110
Really?
- Oh, right.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.112
You're supposed to pull
and master-ber-nate your wiener

06:02.237 --> 06:04.073
really fast.
- Oh, okay.

06:04.198 --> 06:05.240
Okay, retard.

06:05.366 --> 06:07.284
You really don't know
how to make semen come out?

06:07.409 --> 06:09.370
No.
- Follow me to the bathroom.

06:09.495 --> 06:12.164
Mrph, rmhmhm rm.
Mrph rmh rmphm.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.084
Now, go sit on the toilet

06:15.209 --> 06:17.336
and pull and tug on your wiener
until white stuff comes out.

06:17.461 --> 06:19.129
Then put it in this cup.
- My wiener?

06:19.254 --> 06:20.839
Yes, retard,
semen comes from your wiener.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.883
Now, do it!

06:28.097 --> 06:28.972
Well, Butters?

06:29.098 --> 06:31.225
I'm pulling on my wiener,
but nothing's happening.

06:31.350 --> 06:33.560
Well, pull harder!

06:33.685 --> 06:35.062
Ow!

06:35.187 --> 06:37.356
Ow!

06:37.481 --> 06:38.607
It's not working.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.275
Try doing it faster.

06:40.401 --> 06:41.819
Ow. Ow.

06:41.944 --> 06:44.071
Ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow, ow.

06:44.196 --> 06:45.030
No. Nothing.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.740
Butters, you want to go to jail
for the rest of your life?!

06:46.865 --> 06:47.366
No!

06:47.491 --> 06:49.618
Then you better get that sample
no matter how long it takes!

06:49.743 --> 06:50.994
Okay!

06:51.120 --> 06:52.454
Cartman! Cartman!

06:52.579 --> 06:54.665
We just got a tip that a doll
was found near Fosse's house!

06:54.790 --> 06:56.250
Let's go.

06:56.959 --> 06:59.044
Ow. Ow!

07:04.299 --> 07:06.218
Huh, okay,
Miss -- Miss Jones, huh.

07:06.343 --> 07:08.804
Me and Dr. Flick here
just need to check your vagina.

07:08.929 --> 07:09.805
Huh huh huh.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.723
Huh. That's gay.
- Yeah, that's gay.

07:14.560 --> 07:15.394
Kyle.

07:28.782 --> 07:29.825
What?

07:41.962 --> 07:42.963
What?

07:43.630 --> 07:45.215
I see two guys inside.

07:45.340 --> 07:48.552
They have Sarah Peterson's doll,
you stupid Jew!

07:48.677 --> 07:51.138
They've got the doll.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.517
Okay. Okay.
Ready?

07:55.642 --> 07:56.685
Ring the doorbell.

08:01.106 --> 08:02.483
W-W-Who is it?

08:02.608 --> 08:03.859
South Park Junior Detectives.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.611
We know you have
Sarah Peterson's doll.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.613
Heh.
They're playing detective.

08:07.738 --> 08:09.156
Huh huh.
That's gay.

08:09.281 --> 08:10.365
Huh huh.
You're gay!

08:10.491 --> 08:11.825
What do we do now?

08:11.950 --> 08:12.993
I don't know.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.661
If they're not gonna give us
back the doll,

08:14.786 --> 08:16.413
we have no choice.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.665
Let's go tell on them.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.375
Dude, we can't just tell
on them.

08:20.501 --> 08:21.376
Why not?

08:21.502 --> 08:22.836
Because, dude,
we're playing detectives.

08:22.961 --> 08:24.671
Detectives don't just go tell
on people.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.590
H-Hey, detectives.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.300
Huh huh, if you
don't get out of here,

08:28.425 --> 08:29.927
we're gonna rip
the doll's head off.

08:30.052 --> 08:30.969
Huh huh huh.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.095
Huh huh. Yeah.

08:32.221 --> 08:34.640
We were playing gynecologist,
and now we're playing criminals.

08:34.765 --> 08:36.558
Huh huh. Yeah.
That's gay.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.060
Huh huh.
We're gay.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.145
Jesus. They're gonna kill her.
- We've got to do something.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.313
Time.
Time is what we need.

08:41.438 --> 08:42.773
But time is something
we ain't got!

08:42.898 --> 08:44.775
Attention!
You in the house!

08:44.900 --> 08:46.276
This is Agent Tucker
with the FBI.

08:46.401 --> 08:48.070
We have you surrounded --
sort of.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.614
Hey, you buttholes
can't play FBI here.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.324
Yeah.
This was our hot lead.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.326
And you did a great job
leading us here.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.078
Now you just stay out
of our way.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.371
The gig is up, Fosse.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.540
Bring out the doll
or we'll tell on you.

08:59.665 --> 09:01.375
We're going to charge
the front door and go get it.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.376
No, you're not.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.127
Damn it, man, this is not
the time for negotiations!

09:04.253 --> 09:06.380
There's a little doll about to
have her head twisted off!

09:06.505 --> 09:07.381
Climb off, kid.

09:07.506 --> 09:08.799
We say you can't charge
the front door,

09:08.924 --> 09:10.217
and you have to obey
what the FBI says.

09:10.342 --> 09:11.218
That's the rules.

09:11.343 --> 09:13.136
Just because your parents
can afford better toys than ours

09:13.262 --> 09:14.513
doesn't make you better than us.

09:14.638 --> 09:17.474
Yes, it does so.

09:21.478 --> 09:22.729
Mrph rmh rmphm?

09:22.854 --> 09:24.106
We go get the doll ourselves.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.108
But they said we can't charge
the front door.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.193
That's right.

09:28.318 --> 09:31.113
But they didn't say anything
about going in the back.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.114
Come on, guys.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.865
You don't want to hurt
that doll.

09:33.991 --> 09:35.742
Huh huh. Oh, crap.
They're coming in the back.

09:37.536 --> 09:39.079
Mrph. Mrph.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.164
Huh huh.

09:42.541 --> 09:44.084
Huh huh.
That's gay.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.295
Bang! Bang! Bang!
I got you, Fosse.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.005
Huh. No, you didn't.
- Did so!

09:48.130 --> 09:50.757
No, 'cause I got
special wizard armor on.

09:50.882 --> 09:52.551
We're not playing
Dungeons and Dragons, ass face!

09:52.676 --> 09:53.677
All right. That does it.

09:53.802 --> 09:56.096
Cover me.
I'm going slo-mo.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.269
Oh. He got me.

10:02.394 --> 10:03.937
Bleah. Huh.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.814
Bleah. Bleah.

10:05.939 --> 10:06.898
Huh huh.
Yeah.

10:07.024 --> 10:09.943
Ohh, ugh.
Ohh, ugh.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.445
Huh huh.
We're dead.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.280
Huh huh.
That's gay.

10:14.364 --> 10:15.907
We got it.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.042
Ms. Peterson,
is your daughter home?

10:26.168 --> 10:27.294
My dolly!

10:28.378 --> 10:31.048
We got her back safe. We lost a
lot of good men in the process.

10:31.173 --> 10:32.841
Well, you boys are
little heroes.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.426
I'm gonna call
the police department

10:34.551 --> 10:36.803
and let them know what brave
little detectives you are.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.602
Hello, there,
little crime stoppers.

10:43.727 --> 10:46.188
I'm Lieutenant Dawson
with the Park County police.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.564
I heard you did a great job

10:47.689 --> 10:49.900
finding little Sarah Peterson's
doll.

10:50.025 --> 10:51.234
We do what we can, sir.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.445
Well, that's fantastic, kids.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.656
And for all your
terrific sleuth-solving,

10:55.781 --> 10:58.992
I'm hereby making you all
Junior Detectives.

11:01.787 --> 11:02.621
Wow.

11:02.746 --> 11:03.872
Awesome.
- Sweet.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.833
That means you boys are now an
official part of the department.

11:06.958 --> 11:07.709
Cool!

11:07.834 --> 11:09.795
All right. So, ready
for your first assignment?

11:09.920 --> 11:11.296
Sure.
- Okay.

11:11.421 --> 11:14.049
There's a meth lab
down at 567 Mala Vista.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.676
The operators are probably armed
to the hilt

11:15.801 --> 11:16.802
with illegal weapons.

11:16.927 --> 11:19.262
I want you to get down there
and see what you can find.

11:20.931 --> 11:22.974
Uh...a-a meth lab?

11:23.100 --> 11:25.352
I don't want any problems.
Just take 'em down by the books.

11:25.477 --> 11:26.353
Now, get over there.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.230
The mayor's all over my ass
on this one.

11:30.273 --> 11:32.442
Oh, and, deputies,
you screw this up,

11:32.567 --> 11:34.945
and I'll have you working
graveyard shift behind a desk.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.321
Move it!

11:39.157 --> 11:40.992
What is a meth lab, anyway?

11:41.118 --> 11:42.202
I don't know.
Let's just hurry up.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.246
I want to get home in time
to watch <i>Crime Drama.</i>

11:56.925 --> 11:59.761
Uh, police.
Open up.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.763
Oh, crap. Did you guys do
your math homework?

12:01.888 --> 12:03.265
Oh, dude.
I totally spaced it.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.143
You die, pigs!

12:07.978 --> 12:09.730
You want to die, huh?!

12:18.321 --> 12:20.407
You won't take us alive!

12:30.083 --> 12:31.877
So long, coppers.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.879
Oh, shit!

12:39.551 --> 12:42.053
Damn.

12:43.221 --> 12:46.057
One UPS vehicle
valued at $25,000,

12:46.183 --> 12:48.310
one civilian vehicle
worth $16,000,

12:48.435 --> 12:49.853
the second floor
of the post office,

12:49.978 --> 12:52.606
and a coffee shop
valued at $60,000.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.858
The mayor's gonna have my ass!

12:54.983 --> 12:57.068
Uh, sir, we just got
kind of blindsided by the --

12:57.194 --> 12:58.278
You got careless!

12:58.403 --> 12:59.988
Now, I don't know
how they do things

13:00.113 --> 13:02.657
down at that dog-and-pony show
they call the fourth grade,

13:02.783 --> 13:03.992
but here we have rules.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.161
Jesus, we don't even have guys
to question now

13:06.286 --> 13:07.537
because you killed them all!

13:07.662 --> 13:08.789
We're sorry.

13:08.914 --> 13:11.082
One more slipup like that,
and I'll have your badges.

13:11.208 --> 13:13.835
You hear me?
Now, hit the showers.

13:14.795 --> 13:17.881
Well, well, well.
If it isn't the super cops.

13:19.508 --> 13:22.219
Hey, Murphy, think they'll
let me borrow their G.I. Joes?

13:23.845 --> 13:25.347
Come on, you guys.
Leave 'em alone.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.350
Relax, Hopkins.
All fun and games, right?

13:28.475 --> 13:29.851
So, tell us, rookies,

13:29.976 --> 13:32.854
you, uh, find yourself
a little bonus in that house?

13:32.979 --> 13:33.939
A bonus?

13:34.064 --> 13:36.483
Come on. We all skim a little
off the top.

13:36.608 --> 13:39.861
Oh.
Or are you too good for that?

13:39.986 --> 13:41.321
You think you're
gonna waltz in here

13:41.446 --> 13:42.781
and clean up the system,
is that it?

13:42.906 --> 13:44.866
We just want to be
Junior Detectives.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.117
Look, we all work hard.

13:46.243 --> 13:48.662
And we deserve more than
the $30,000 a year we get paid.

13:48.787 --> 13:50.705
So what if we take in
a little on the side?

13:50.831 --> 13:52.707
Yeah. Who the hell are you
to change that?

13:52.833 --> 13:54.334
I said back off, Murphy.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.253
Why don't you and your
rookie friends make us?

13:56.378 --> 13:57.712
That's right! Come on!
- Yeah, that's right.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.130
Bring it!
- Let's go. Come on! Bring it!

13:59.256 --> 14:00.799
What the hell
is the problem here?!

14:00.924 --> 14:02.217
No problem, sir.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.010
No problem at all.

14:04.135 --> 14:07.097
Then hit the showers,
all of you.

14:11.643 --> 14:13.979
Dude, I don't want to
play detective anymore.

14:14.104 --> 14:15.897
Me neither.
- It'll get better, you guys.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.274
Better how, dude?

14:17.399 --> 14:19.943
Look, we wanted to form a club
to protect and serve South Park.

14:20.068 --> 14:21.152
We put all this time into it.

14:21.278 --> 14:22.654
What do you guys want to do,
huh?

14:22.779 --> 14:24.906
Go back to playing car mechanics
or laundromat owners?

14:25.031 --> 14:26.616
We were happy playing
laundromat owners.

14:26.741 --> 14:27.534
I wasn't.

14:27.659 --> 14:28.577
We started playing detective

14:28.702 --> 14:30.287
because we wanted our playtime
to mean something.

14:30.412 --> 14:31.955
Or have you forgotten
why you joined the force?

14:32.080 --> 14:33.748
Hey, Broflovski's a good cop.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.001
You guys can go back to playing
laundromat owners if you want,

14:36.126 --> 14:37.919
but I'm not gonna give
those kids playing the FBI

14:38.044 --> 14:39.337
a chance to laugh at us.

14:39.462 --> 14:41.673
I'll see you guys at school
tomorrow.

14:49.723 --> 14:52.183
Eric, where have you been?
It's 10:30.

14:52.309 --> 14:54.144
We had to take down a meth lab
on Mala Vista.

14:54.269 --> 14:55.645
Well, you should have
called Mommy.

14:55.770 --> 14:56.855
Will you get off my back?!

14:56.980 --> 14:58.189
It's hard enough
I got to work the beat.

14:58.315 --> 15:00.275
Then I got to come home
to your nagging?

15:00.400 --> 15:02.152
Look. Look. I-I'm sorry.

15:02.277 --> 15:04.779
It's just this case and
the guys down at the station --

15:04.905 --> 15:06.823
I'm tired, all right?
I'm tired.

15:06.948 --> 15:09.242
Well, why don't you get ready
for snoogums' night-night,

15:09.367 --> 15:12.078
and I'll bring you some
toasty chocolate nummers?

15:12.203 --> 15:13.830
Okay.

15:16.541 --> 15:19.002
Oh! Ow.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.670
- Butters?
- Yes?

15:20.795 --> 15:22.756
Are you still trying to give
a semen sample?

15:22.881 --> 15:25.258
I'm trying,
but nothing's coming out.

15:25.383 --> 15:27.218
Well, keep trying, Butters.

15:27.344 --> 15:28.762
Okay.

15:28.887 --> 15:31.306
Ow.
Ow!

15:33.350 --> 15:35.101
And so you can see, children,

15:35.226 --> 15:37.479
that the women's movement
of the late '50s and early '60s

15:37.604 --> 15:41.024
had a profound effect on
feminism in America -- Uh, boys?

15:41.149 --> 15:44.736
Would it trouble you terribly
not to sleep in my class?!

15:44.861 --> 15:46.738
Oh, we weren't sleeping,
Mr. Garrison.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.740
Oh, well, then maybe you can
tell me who was in charge

15:48.865 --> 15:50.992
of the feminist movement
of the early '60s.

15:51.576 --> 15:53.745
A bunch of fat old skanks
on their periods?

15:54.329 --> 15:57.707
Right, but who was the fattest,
oldest skank on her period?

15:59.501 --> 16:01.962
That's what I thought.
Now, pay attention!

16:02.087 --> 16:03.922
Okay, children,
now the biggest skank of all

16:04.047 --> 16:05.423
was an old fat ass
by the name of --

16:05.548 --> 16:07.467
Marsh! Broflovski!
McCormick! Cartman!

16:07.592 --> 16:09.844
In my office!

16:12.389 --> 16:14.307
Looks like that meth lab
you took down

16:14.432 --> 16:15.850
was just the tip of the iceberg.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.477
They found a paper trail
leading all the way

16:17.602 --> 16:19.938
to the biggest crime syndicate
in Colorado.

16:20.063 --> 16:20.772
Uh-oh.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.440
The operators apparently
run their business

16:22.565 --> 16:24.526
out of a sleazy strip joint
down in Englewood.

16:24.651 --> 16:28.238
They're all cop killers, so I'm
sending you in undercover.

16:28.363 --> 16:30.782
Uh, sir, I have a lot
of homework to do tonight,

16:30.907 --> 16:32.033
and I was --
- What?!

16:32.158 --> 16:32.993
Now, you listen to me.

16:33.118 --> 16:34.577
I'm giving you one last chance.

16:34.703 --> 16:37.205
You're good cops, but you let
your emotions get in the way.

16:37.330 --> 16:40.542
And your little shoot-first,
ask-questions-later technique

16:40.667 --> 16:42.043
has no place in this century!

16:42.168 --> 16:44.129
Now, you get down
to that strip joint,

16:44.254 --> 16:46.297
and you do it by the books,
you got it?!

16:46.423 --> 16:49.009
The mayor is -- my ass --
Blah blah blah!

16:53.430 --> 16:56.641
So, what did you boys
have to say to the lieutenant?

16:56.766 --> 16:58.601
Nothing. He just told us
a bunch of stuff.

16:58.727 --> 17:01.104
Maybe you decided you needed to
tell him about our...

17:01.229 --> 17:02.188
bonus money.

17:02.313 --> 17:03.523
No.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.693
They're lying.

17:06.818 --> 17:08.653
They're dead.

17:18.455 --> 17:20.331
Dude, if my mom
knew I was in here,

17:20.457 --> 17:22.709
I would be in super-big trouble.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.295
Mrph rmh!

17:27.380 --> 17:29.966
Would you like a dance?

17:30.091 --> 17:30.884
No, thanks.

17:31.009 --> 17:33.595
Dance?
Anyone like a dance?

17:33.720 --> 17:35.180
All right, guys.
put your hands together.

17:35.305 --> 17:36.264
Be sure to tip the dancers.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.516
All right.
Now let's hear it for Candy.

17:38.641 --> 17:41.019
Whoa. Whoa. What the hell
are you kids doing in here?

17:41.144 --> 17:43.438
This isn't an appropriate place
for children.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.814
Dance?

17:44.939 --> 17:46.775
Anyone like a dance?

17:46.900 --> 17:48.735
Uh, it's okay.
We know the owner.

17:48.860 --> 17:50.779
Oh, really?
Let's go see.

17:50.904 --> 17:53.990
We'll have to start having the
McCormicks make our meth again.

17:54.115 --> 17:56.201
Hey, Gino, these kids
say they know you.

17:56.326 --> 17:58.453
What?
I don't know no kids.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.955
I didn't think so.
All right, you kids.

18:01.081 --> 18:01.956
Hey, wait a minute.

18:02.082 --> 18:03.458
These kids might be
just what we need

18:03.583 --> 18:05.627
to get our drugs past
the security at D.I.A.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.629
how would you like to join
our family?

18:07.754 --> 18:10.548
Yo, Gino, I know I seen
these kids before, man.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.550
These kids are five-o.
- What?

18:12.675 --> 18:14.177
These kids are cops, man!

18:15.970 --> 18:17.472
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

18:19.432 --> 18:21.142
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
- Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

18:22.936 --> 18:24.395
Mrph rmh.
Mrph rmh.

18:24.521 --> 18:26.356
Kenny, it doesn't go
"peekew-peekew."

18:26.481 --> 18:27.982
It goes "Bang! Bang! Bang!"

18:32.946 --> 18:34.280
God damn it!

18:34.405 --> 18:37.617
Those Junior Detectives and
their heroically reckless ways.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.661
Murphy, Jenkins, Hopkins,
get in there!

18:43.414 --> 18:45.166
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang!

18:46.960 --> 18:50.797
Da-a-a-nce?!
Anybody like a da-a-a-a-nce?

18:51.297 --> 18:53.299
Freeze!
South Park detectives!

18:54.801 --> 18:57.470
Great job, boys.
You found the meth boss.

18:58.054 --> 19:00.723
Detective Murphy. Jenkins.
What the hell are you doing?

19:00.849 --> 19:02.308
We had a deal!

19:02.433 --> 19:04.060
A deal?

19:04.185 --> 19:06.688
That's right. We're partners
in the drug business.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.816
Everything was fine until these
super cops joined the force.

19:11.025 --> 19:12.485
Now we got to kill you all.

19:12.610 --> 19:13.486
Boys! Down!

19:19.784 --> 19:20.994
All right, guys.
Put your hands together.

19:21.119 --> 19:22.245
Lot of shootin'
and killin' going on.

19:22.370 --> 19:23.413
But be sure to tip
your waitress.

19:23.538 --> 19:25.665
Let's hear it for Rebecca.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.879
Christ! Those Junior Detectives
have no regard for the law.

19:32.881 --> 19:35.592
Get me a hard line to the phone.
And I want choppers on the roof!

19:35.717 --> 19:37.093
Who the hell are you?

19:37.218 --> 19:38.803
Agent Fields, FBI.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.889
Hey, I'm in charge
of this investigation.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.891
Not anymore you're not.

19:43.016 --> 19:45.059
But that's not fair!

19:45.185 --> 19:47.187
Is so!
Is so!

19:50.940 --> 19:52.942
Aah!

19:53.067 --> 19:54.777
Sorry, Detective Hopkins.

19:54.903 --> 19:57.780
We can't let anybody know
about our partnership.

19:57.906 --> 20:00.742
That's right.
We split it all, 50-50!

20:00.867 --> 20:02.702
That's right.

20:04.954 --> 20:06.748
I think we'll take 100% now.

20:06.873 --> 20:07.874
Huh huh. Yeah.

20:07.999 --> 20:09.751
Sorry, Gino,
but in business like this,

20:09.876 --> 20:11.878
sometimes partnerships
need to end.

20:12.003 --> 20:14.589
That's right.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.966
Sometimes partnerships
need to end.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.177
Well, super cops,

20:19.302 --> 20:22.096
looks like I'll be taking in
all the money now.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.514
I'm in business alone.

20:23.640 --> 20:27.060
And that means that the only
person that I can't trust...

20:27.185 --> 20:28.645
is myself.

20:35.610 --> 20:38.279
Looks like Murphy and Jenkins
got what they deserved.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.447
If it weren't for you boys,

20:39.572 --> 20:41.366
we would've never cleaned up
the department.

20:41.491 --> 20:43.910
All right, detectives.
Let's get one thing straight.

20:44.035 --> 20:45.995
I do not agree
with your methods.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.456
You're uncontrolled
and you're negligent!

20:48.581 --> 20:50.750
But, by God,
you get the job done.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.168
Congratulations.

20:52.293 --> 20:53.378
Thanks.

20:53.503 --> 20:55.546
I'm probably gonna regret this,
but, well,

20:55.672 --> 20:57.674
I'm promoting you
to full detectives.

20:57.799 --> 20:58.967
There'll be lots more action

20:59.092 --> 21:01.177
and that big paycheck
you've always wanted.

21:03.263 --> 21:05.723
I think I have a better idea.

21:06.474 --> 21:08.685
Hello, sir. Welcome to
the Broflovski Laundromat.

21:08.810 --> 21:11.271
Yes. I have a suit I need
dry-cleaned and pressed, please.

21:11.396 --> 21:12.522
Certainly.

21:12.647 --> 21:13.731
Here you are, Mr. McCormick.

21:13.856 --> 21:15.233
Your laundry is all done
and folded.

21:15.358 --> 21:16.901
That will be $9.95.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.069
On your American Express.

21:18.194 --> 21:20.363
Fellas! Hey, fellas!
I got it!

21:20.488 --> 21:22.407
- I-I got my semen sample!
- You did?

21:22.532 --> 21:25.076
Yeah. I was up there pounding
my wiener for two days straight.

21:25.201 --> 21:27.495
A-And finally I thought about
Stan's mom's boobs,

21:27.620 --> 21:30.290
and this little tiny spooge
of this white stuff came out.

21:30.415 --> 21:32.250
That's great, but we're not
playing detective anymore.

21:32.375 --> 21:33.376
We're playing laundromat owners.

21:33.501 --> 21:35.253
Would you like those
pants cleaned for $4.95?
