WEBVTT

00:04.395 --> 00:06.049
OF COURSE.

00:13.578 --> 00:15.885
I LOVE IT.

00:15.928 --> 00:18.018
IT'S GIVING ME
MODERN SHIFU.

00:22.631 --> 00:25.938
PEI-LING,
ARE YOU OK?

00:25.982 --> 00:28.419
IT IS JUST...

00:28.463 --> 00:31.161
THE KINDNESS YOUR
FAMILY HAS SHOWN ME,

00:31.205 --> 00:33.598
EVEN AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

00:33.642 --> 00:36.427
NO. WE KNOW
THAT WASN'T YOU.

00:36.471 --> 00:38.386
EVERYONE'S JUST GLAD
YOU'RE FEELING BETTER

00:38.429 --> 00:41.084
AND THAT YOU'RE FINALLY
LETTING ME MAKE YOU OVER.

00:42.390 --> 00:44.609
UM, SPEAKING
OF WHICH, MAY I?

00:51.834 --> 00:53.270
AH.

00:54.619 --> 00:57.405
I KNEW IT.
ALL RIGHT.

00:57.448 --> 00:59.450
NEXT LOOK.

01:04.238 --> 01:05.239
I THINK THIS ONE--

01:10.461 --> 01:15.292
PEI-LING?

01:15.336 --> 01:17.599
WHAT'S WRONG?

01:23.170 --> 01:24.910
I'M GLAD
YOU CAME.

01:24.954 --> 01:26.434
I KNOW I'VE BEEN
A LITTLE...

01:26.477 --> 01:28.740
YEAH. YOU'VE BEEN
A LITTLE.

01:28.784 --> 01:32.396
SINCE THAILAND, IT'S BEEN
ONE CRISIS AFTER ANOTHER.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.311
MY EX, HENRY,
GOT KIND OF SICK,

01:34.355 --> 01:36.313
SO I HAD TO HELP HIM
SETTLE IN,

01:36.357 --> 01:38.402
WHILE I MOVED OUT OF HIS
APARTMENT AND BACK HOME.

01:38.446 --> 01:39.925
WAIT, WAIT. THAT WAS
YOUR EX'S PLACE?

01:39.969 --> 01:43.494
OH. YEAH. BUT I'M OUT NOW,

01:43.538 --> 01:45.017
LIKE ALL THE WAY OUT.

01:45.061 --> 01:49.152
BUT I MEANT IT.
I'VE REALLY MISSED YOU.

01:49.196 --> 01:53.287
NICKY, LOOK, I HAVEN'T
BEEN SUBTLE.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.158
YOU KNOW
THAT I'M INTO YOU.

01:55.202 --> 01:57.247
BUT BEFORE I GO
ANY DEEPER,

01:57.291 --> 02:00.598
I NEED TO KNOW THAT
YOU'RE REALLY AVAILABLE.

02:00.642 --> 02:02.339
I AM.

02:08.911 --> 02:12.349
CHECKING YOUR
TEXTS, NOT A CRIME.

02:12.393 --> 02:13.742
SORRY.

02:18.225 --> 02:19.704
ANOTHER CRISIS?

02:19.748 --> 02:21.663
SOMETHING'S COME UP WITH
MY FRIEND--NOT HENRY--

02:21.706 --> 02:23.273
THE OTHER FRIEND.

02:23.317 --> 02:24.361
AND YOU NEED TO GO?

02:24.405 --> 02:25.623
YEAH.

02:25.667 --> 02:28.713
BUT CAN I SEE YOU AGAIN?

02:28.757 --> 02:32.195
THERE'S A FIREWORKS SHOW
BY THE BAY TOMORROW NIGHT.

02:32.239 --> 02:33.805
I THOUGHT WE COULD GO.

02:33.849 --> 02:38.027
I PROMISE YOU'LL HAVE
MY UNDIVIDED ATTENTION.

02:41.335 --> 02:43.728
FIREWORKS, HUH?

02:45.687 --> 02:48.516
THE YOUNGER
GENERATION GETS IT,

02:48.559 --> 02:49.865
BUT A LOT OF MY PEERS,

02:49.908 --> 02:52.389
THEY WANT YOU TO SIGN
ORDINANCE 11.

02:52.433 --> 02:55.827
SO I TRY TO EXPLAIN
TO THEM IT'S A MISTAKE

02:55.871 --> 02:58.874
TO GIVE ALL THAT POWER TO
A PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANY,

02:58.917 --> 03:00.571
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE NEED
THE MONEY

03:00.615 --> 03:03.748
TO ADDRESS REAL PROBLEMS
IN CHINATOWN.

03:03.792 --> 03:05.750
ARE THEY RESPONSIVE?
SOME ARE.

03:05.794 --> 03:07.926
BUT THEY JUST
WANT HELP FAST.

03:07.970 --> 03:09.928
WELL, YOU'VE GOT THAT
BIG KBNN INTERVIEW TOMORROW.

03:09.972 --> 03:11.930
WE NEED STRONG TALKING
POINTS TO SELL YOUR POSITION.

03:11.974 --> 03:13.584
JIN, COULD
YOU HELP WITH THAT?

03:13.628 --> 03:15.499
OF COURSE.
OF COURSE.

03:15.543 --> 03:17.545
IT'S NOT JUST
AN ORDINANCE 11 PROBLEM.

03:17.588 --> 03:19.111
YOUR OPPONENT IS
PAINTING YOU

03:19.155 --> 03:21.331
AS OUT OF TOUCH
IN ALL AREAS.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.333
AND IF SARAH COLLINS' LAST
RUN FOR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS

03:23.377 --> 03:25.074
IS ANY INDICATION,

03:25.117 --> 03:27.119
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF
TIME BEFORE SHE PLAYS DIRTY.

03:27.163 --> 03:28.599
THAT'S WHY...

03:28.643 --> 03:31.254
I HAD THIS PREPARED.

03:31.298 --> 03:32.951
HIRED AN OUTSIDE FIRM
FOR AN OPPO ON YOU.

03:32.995 --> 03:34.344
OPPO?

03:34.388 --> 03:36.955
OPPOSITION RESEARCH,
DIGGING UP DIRT,

03:36.999 --> 03:38.435
A BIG PART OF
CITY POLITICS.

03:38.479 --> 03:40.611
THIS IS INTERNAL OPPO,
OUR EYES ONLY.

03:40.655 --> 03:43.397
I FIGURED WE SHOULD SEE
WHAT SARAH MIGHT USE AGAINST US.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.050
ANYTHING JUICY IN HERE?

03:45.094 --> 03:46.704
ONLY STARTED
TO REVIEW IT.

03:46.748 --> 03:48.402
SO FAR, THE WORST
THING I'VE SEEN--

03:48.445 --> 03:50.447
2017--3 PARKING TICKETS.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.321
LOCK ME UP.

03:57.976 --> 03:59.804
ANYTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT?

03:59.848 --> 04:02.242
OVERDUE LIBRARY BOOKS.

04:02.285 --> 04:04.461
I'M GOING TO
REVIEW IT TONIGHT,

04:04.505 --> 04:07.029
BUT I THINK THE CAMPAIGN
WILL SURVIVE.

04:13.209 --> 04:14.906
A SMIDGE MORE
CHILI OIL.

04:14.950 --> 04:16.560
YEAH.

04:16.604 --> 04:18.301
I HOPE CARRIE'S GONNA
LIKE THESE NEW DISHES.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.172
ANYTHING FOR THE SUITS.

04:21.478 --> 04:24.264
SORRY, CHEF. JUST--

04:24.307 --> 04:26.440
JUST GETTING
USED TO ALL THIS.

04:26.483 --> 04:29.486
I MEAN, MENU APPROVAL?

04:29.530 --> 04:31.836
LIKE, CORPORATE KNOWS
BETTER THAN WE DO? COME ON.

04:31.880 --> 04:34.622
SEBASTIAN, WE COULD DO
A LOT WORSE THAN CARRIE.

04:34.665 --> 04:36.493
SHE HAS BEEN REALLY SUPPORTIVE.

04:36.537 --> 04:37.625
- YEAH. OK.
- OK?

04:37.668 --> 04:38.800
- OK.
- ALL RIGHT.

04:38.843 --> 04:41.759
HI, CHEF, SEBASTIAN.

04:41.803 --> 04:44.675
CARRIE, WE HAVE TWO NEW
SEASONAL DISHES FOR YOU TO TRY.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.808
AH. IT SMELLS AMAZING.

04:46.851 --> 04:48.679
SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO
STEP INTO THE DINING ROOM,

04:48.723 --> 04:51.116
GET THE FULL
WHITE TABLECLOTH EXPERIENCE?

04:51.160 --> 04:53.902
NO NEED. I'LL TAKE
IT WHILE IT'S HOT.

04:57.558 --> 04:58.820
HMM.

05:07.916 --> 05:09.309
MEI-LI: YOU LIKE IT?

05:09.352 --> 05:11.963
SEBASTIAN TOOK
THE LEAD ON THAT.

05:12.007 --> 05:14.270
OH, VERY NICE.
GOOD WORK. APPROVED.

05:15.924 --> 05:18.535
HMM. NICE.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.711
"NICE"?

05:20.755 --> 05:22.452
SEBASTIAN.

05:22.496 --> 05:24.106
OH.

05:38.512 --> 05:39.643
YOU'RE HURTING ME.

05:39.687 --> 05:40.775
STOP.

05:42.516 --> 05:43.604
PEI-LING?

05:47.042 --> 05:49.087
I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU JOINED THE CAMPAIGN, JIN.

05:49.131 --> 05:50.654
YOUR, UH, VOICE,
YOUR PERSPECTIVE,

05:50.698 --> 05:52.177
IT MATTERS TO ME,
YOU KNOW?

05:52.221 --> 05:53.657
OF COURSE.

05:53.701 --> 05:55.398
UH, RIGHT ACROSS
THE STREET.

05:55.442 --> 05:56.878
UH, BIG DAY TOMORROW.
YOU GET SOME REST, HUH?

05:56.921 --> 05:58.183
- YEAH, YOU TOO. ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH.

05:58.227 --> 05:59.446
SEE YOU.

06:05.147 --> 06:07.192
GIVE ME YOUR MONEY.

06:07.236 --> 06:08.759
HEY, OK.

06:08.803 --> 06:11.936
NO NEED FOR THAT, OK?
JUST...

06:11.980 --> 06:13.111
TAKE IT, OK?

06:13.155 --> 06:14.765
THE BRIEFCASE, TOO.

06:14.809 --> 06:16.027
THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE,
MAN. JUST PAPERS.

06:16.071 --> 06:17.812
GIVE IT TO ME!

06:19.553 --> 06:21.685
HEY! ANTHONY! LET HIM GO.

06:21.729 --> 06:23.121
UH!

06:23.165 --> 06:26.298
ANTHONY! YOU OK?

06:26.342 --> 06:27.430
OH, MY GOSH. OW.

06:27.474 --> 06:29.389
WATCH OUT!

06:30.477 --> 06:31.956
MY BRIEFCASE.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.436
HEY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.133
LOOK, YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU DIDN'T GET HURT.

06:35.177 --> 06:37.135
THE RESEARCH, JIN.
THERE'S TONS OF OPPO IN THAT CASE.

06:37.179 --> 06:39.311
YEAH, BUT YOU SAID
IT WASN'T SO BAD.

06:39.355 --> 06:41.618
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
THAT'S FREE AMMO FOR THE COLLINS CAMPAIGN.

06:41.662 --> 06:43.403
THEY COULD BURY US.

06:47.798 --> 06:49.321
PEI-LING?

06:49.365 --> 06:51.019
SHIFU!

06:52.977 --> 06:57.199
I CANNOT HOLD HER IN ANYMORE.

06:58.461 --> 07:01.769
XIAO IS GETTING STRONGER.

07:23.878 --> 07:28.491
WE'RE GIVING UP OUR HOME,
OUR SAFETY FOR HER PLAN.

07:28.535 --> 07:30.014
SHE MURDERED SIMON.

07:30.058 --> 07:32.103
SHE'S A KILLER.

07:32.147 --> 07:34.628
A KILLER WHO'S
RISKING EVERYTHING.

07:36.064 --> 07:37.500
WE'RE JUST SPIRITS.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.371
ZHILAN'S ALIVE,

07:39.415 --> 07:40.764
AND SHE'S PUTTING THAT
LIFE ON THE LINE

07:40.808 --> 07:42.723
TO DEFEAT
THE HARVESTER FOR US.

07:51.209 --> 07:54.865
THEY'RE JUST NERVOUS,
SCARED TO LEAVE THIS PLACE.

07:54.909 --> 07:58.173
WHAT IF THEY'RE RIGHT?
WHAT IF I FAIL?

07:58.216 --> 08:01.219
YOU CAN'T THINK LIKE THAT.

08:01.263 --> 08:03.221
HEY, I WANT
TO INTRODUCE YOU

08:03.265 --> 08:05.397
TO A PERSONAL
FRIEND OF MINE.

08:06.921 --> 08:08.966
I'M NOT SAYING IT'LL
MAKE A DIFFERENCE,

08:09.010 --> 08:11.099
BUT IT'S THE BEST
WEAPON WE'VE GOT.

08:13.710 --> 08:15.669
THANK YOU, SIMON.

08:15.712 --> 08:18.541
RELAX. IT'S A LOANER.

08:18.585 --> 08:21.762
YOU SURVIVE THIS THING,
I'M GETTING THAT BACK.

08:31.946 --> 08:34.339
SHOULDN'T
SHE BE RESTING?

08:34.383 --> 08:35.384
SHE INSISTED I BRING
HER EVERYTHING

08:35.427 --> 08:36.559
WE'VE GOT ON XIAO.

08:36.603 --> 08:37.865
WHAT DO WE DO?

08:37.908 --> 08:39.736
I DON'T KNOW.
THEY DIDN'T TEACH US

08:39.780 --> 08:41.738
HOW TO EXORCISE EVIL
ALCHEMIST SPIRITS IN MED SCHOOL.

08:41.782 --> 08:43.740
ALL I KNOW IS
HER VITALS ARE PLUMMETING.

08:43.784 --> 08:46.177
XIAO'S GETTING STRONGER,
SPILLING OVER,

08:46.221 --> 08:48.440
INFECTING PEI-LING'S
THOUGHTS.

08:49.790 --> 08:52.401
SHE CAN'T HOLD
HER IN MUCH LONGER.

08:52.444 --> 08:55.056
RYAN, WE COULD LOSE HER.

09:01.932 --> 09:03.107
EVERYTHING OK?

09:03.151 --> 09:04.761
I HAD PLANS WITH BO TONIGHT.

09:04.805 --> 09:07.068
THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT.
I HAVE TO CANCEL.

09:07.111 --> 09:08.896
I'M SURE
HE'LL UNDERSTAND.

09:08.939 --> 09:11.115
WILL HE? I CAN'T EXACTLY
TELL HIM WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON.

09:11.159 --> 09:14.379
WHY NOT? HE'S A FIGHTER.
HE'S ALREADY HELPED US.

09:14.423 --> 09:15.946
THIS STUFF IS DIFFERENT--

09:15.990 --> 09:18.296
RESURRECTION,
MYSTICAL POSSESSION.

09:18.340 --> 09:20.298
WE JUST STARTED.

09:20.342 --> 09:22.474
IT'S TOO SOON TO THROW
HIM INTO THE DEEP END.

09:22.518 --> 09:24.999
I DON'T WANT
TO FREAK HIM OUT.

09:33.007 --> 09:34.574
OK, THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING,

09:34.617 --> 09:36.053
SOME RESEARCH WE
HAVEN'T TURNED UP YET.

09:36.097 --> 09:38.055
MAYBE PEI-LING WILL FIND
SOMETHING IN THERE,

09:38.099 --> 09:40.971
BUT I'M ALL TAPPED OUT, AND I
DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO LOOK.

09:41.015 --> 09:43.713
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
CALLING IN THE EXPERT?

09:43.757 --> 09:45.149
HENRY?

09:45.193 --> 09:46.498
IT MIGHT BE AWKWARD,

09:46.542 --> 09:48.283
BUT MYSTICAL RESEARCH LORE,

09:48.326 --> 09:50.024
HE'S THE BEST WE'VE GOT.

09:52.548 --> 09:53.984
SOMEONE HAS TO STAY
WITH HER.

09:54.028 --> 09:55.812
UH, I'VE GOT SOME TIME
TILL MY SHIFT STARTS.

09:55.856 --> 09:58.293
YOU CANNOT BE
ALONE WITH ME.

09:58.336 --> 10:00.469
IT IS NOT SAFE.

10:00.512 --> 10:04.212
XIAO COULD TAKE OVER
AT ANY MOMENT.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.999
OH. DON'T
FORGET THE EDGES.

10:09.043 --> 10:11.523
I KNOW IT'S DUSTY.

10:11.567 --> 10:14.091
I TOLD MYSELF AS SOON AS
WE GOT SOME MORE PAYING CLIENTS,

10:14.135 --> 10:16.180
I'D HIRE A CLEANER,
BUT, UH,

10:16.224 --> 10:18.226
SO FAR ALL MY WORK'S
BEEN PRO BONO.

10:19.531 --> 10:21.621
- ALTHEA.
- BABA!

10:21.664 --> 10:22.665
MR. SHEN, YOU OK?

10:22.709 --> 10:24.188
YEAH.

10:24.232 --> 10:26.190
THERE WAS AN INCIDENT
LAST NIGHT.

10:26.234 --> 10:28.366
ANTHONY CHAN
WAS MUGGED

10:28.410 --> 10:30.325
BLOCKS
FROM THE RESTAURANT.

10:30.368 --> 10:32.153
WAIT. YOU WERE THERE?
ARE YOU OK?

10:32.196 --> 10:34.329
I'M FINE, SWEETIE.

10:34.372 --> 10:37.027
THE THIEF GOT AWAY WITH
HIS WATCH, WALLET, AND HIS BRIEFCASE.

10:37.071 --> 10:40.552
THERE'S DOCUMENTS INSIDE,
OPPOSITION RESEARCH.

10:40.596 --> 10:42.032
UH, WHAT DID THE POLICE SAY?

10:42.076 --> 10:43.686
HE DIDN'T WANT
THE POLICE INVOLVED.

10:43.730 --> 10:46.384
THEY'RE ALREADY SLAMMING
HIM ABOUT SOFT ON CRIME.

10:46.428 --> 10:48.691
WE FIGURED YOU GUYS
COULD HELP, RIGHT?

10:48.735 --> 10:51.389
FIND THE THIEF,
GET HIS THINGS BACK.

10:51.433 --> 10:53.174
HE'S WILLING TO PAY
FOR YOUR SERVICES.

10:53.217 --> 10:55.393
WE'RE ON IT, BABA.

10:55.437 --> 10:56.699
OK.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.788
WHERE EXACTLY DID
THIS GO DOWN?

10:58.832 --> 11:02.183
RIGHT IN FRONT OF
FANCY JOHN PAWN SHOP.

11:03.445 --> 11:05.012
UH, FANCY JOHN?

11:06.709 --> 11:08.319
IT'S A LONG STORY.

11:08.363 --> 11:11.061
UH, DOES FANCY JOHN HAVE
SECURITY CAMERAS?

11:11.105 --> 11:12.846
HE'S A SECURITY NUT,

11:12.889 --> 11:15.587
BUT GOOD LUCK TO TRY TO
GET HIM TO HELP YOU OUT.

11:15.631 --> 11:17.502
DON'T WORRY, BABA.

11:17.546 --> 11:19.461
WE'VE GOT YOU COVERED.

11:21.942 --> 11:24.292
RYAN,
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?

11:28.296 --> 11:30.428
AN ACCOUNT OF
XIAO'S LAST DAYS.

11:30.472 --> 11:32.735
NOT CLOSELY. I'VE BEEN
FOCUSED ON HER MAGIC.

11:32.779 --> 11:36.478
THE EMPEROR
HAD HER KILLED.

11:38.219 --> 11:40.612
"PARANOID OF
HER GROWING POWER

11:40.656 --> 11:42.919
"AND DOUBTING
HER LOYALTY,

11:42.963 --> 11:45.226
"THE EMPEROR
TURNED ON THE WOMAN

11:45.269 --> 11:47.402
WHO HAD DEDICATED
HER LIFE TO HIM."

11:47.445 --> 11:49.012
HE BETRAYED HER.

11:49.056 --> 11:53.277
THAT IS THE CELL HE
BUILT TO CONTAIN HER.

11:54.931 --> 11:57.717
HE KNEW SHE WAS
A TRAVELER,

11:57.760 --> 12:00.197
THAT NO ORDINARY JAIL
COULD HOLD HER,

12:00.241 --> 12:02.939
SO HE HAD IT
SPECIALLY MADE,

12:02.983 --> 12:07.944
THE BARS ETCHED
WITH MYSTICAL RUNES.

12:07.988 --> 12:10.164
HOW DID SHE DIE?

12:12.079 --> 12:15.256
SHE STARVED TO DEATH
IN THAT CAGE.

12:18.259 --> 12:21.610
HEY.

12:23.917 --> 12:25.919
ANYTHING NEW
ON THE COMPASS?

12:25.962 --> 12:27.485
NOPE.

12:27.529 --> 12:29.313
I KNOW THE COMPASS' POWER
IS IN ME,

12:29.357 --> 12:31.794
BUT I DON'T FEEL
ANY DIFFERENT.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.492
I'M WONDERING IF IT'S
ALL A BUNCH OF HYPE.

12:34.536 --> 12:37.582
WHAT'S UP? DID YOU--
DID YOU FORGET SOMETHING?

12:37.626 --> 12:39.933
I SAW YOUR BLENDER
UNDER THE SINK.

12:39.976 --> 12:41.804
I CAN GET THAT FOR YOU.

12:44.546 --> 12:45.677
HEY.

12:46.983 --> 12:48.768
NICKY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:50.552 --> 12:53.294
PEI-LING IS IN TROUBLE.

12:53.337 --> 12:55.818
XIAO IS GETTING STRONGER,

12:55.862 --> 12:59.169
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO FIX IT.

12:59.213 --> 13:01.389
I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA
LOSE HER AGAIN.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.742
I CAN HELP.

13:08.352 --> 13:09.658
THANK YOU.

13:13.227 --> 13:17.187
OHH! CORPORATE IS GONNA
BLOW THEIR TOP

13:17.231 --> 13:19.494
WE DIDN'T HIRE
PROFESSIONAL DESIGNERS,

13:19.537 --> 13:21.539
BUT THESE MENUS
ARE GREAT.

13:21.583 --> 13:24.368
WELL, JIN'S THE ARTIST.
HE HELPED.

13:24.412 --> 13:26.675
BUT I AM HAVING FUN
WITH THE DESIGNS.

13:26.718 --> 13:28.459
I GUESS CORPORATE
DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOW

13:28.503 --> 13:30.200
THAT THEY WERE DONE
IN-HOUSE.

13:32.072 --> 13:33.377
OH, HEY.

13:33.421 --> 13:36.511
WHAT'S
"PANCIT WITH MAMI"?

13:36.554 --> 13:38.556
OH. THAT'S SEB'S IDEA.

13:38.600 --> 13:42.473
HE FUSED OUR NOODLES WITH A
DISH FROM HIS FAMILY'S HOMETOWN IN CEBU.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.127
YOU LOVED IT LAST NIGHT.

13:44.171 --> 13:47.043
OH.
YEAH. I JUST-- I--I GUESS I DIDN'T REALIZE

13:47.087 --> 13:48.871
THAT IT'S
A FILIPINO DISH.

13:48.915 --> 13:51.352
MEI-LI: OH, NO, NO.
IT'S NOT JUST FILIPINO.

13:51.395 --> 13:54.224
IT'S OURS. IT'S BOTH.

13:54.268 --> 13:55.573
SO FUSION?

13:55.617 --> 13:57.053
YEAH.

13:57.097 --> 13:59.882
MEI-LI, WE'RE SELLING
CHINESE FOOD.

13:59.926 --> 14:02.537
AUTHENTICITY IS A HUGE
PART OF THE BRAND.

14:02.580 --> 14:04.147
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

14:04.191 --> 14:08.195
NO. NO. WE'RE JUST
DISCUSSING MENU ITEMS.

14:08.238 --> 14:10.023
I JUST DON'T SEE
CORPORATE AGREEING

14:10.066 --> 14:11.763
TO CHINESE-FILIPINO
FUSIONS.

14:11.807 --> 14:13.243
OH, MAN.

14:13.287 --> 14:15.767
SHOULD WE TAKE JAJANGMYEON
OFF THE MENU, TOO?

14:15.811 --> 14:17.769
- SEBASTIAN.
- NO, CHEF, I'M SORRY,

14:17.813 --> 14:19.554
BUT POLICING THE BOUNDARIES
BETWEEN ASIAN CUISINES.

14:19.597 --> 14:22.644
AND ESPECIALLY
COMING FROM A--

14:23.732 --> 14:25.603
A WHAT?

14:27.649 --> 14:29.912
I DIDN'T MEAN TO START
A CULTURAL CONVERSATION.

14:29.956 --> 14:33.568
THIS IS A BUSINESS ISSUE.
THIS RESTAURANT IS A BUSINESS.

14:33.611 --> 14:35.962
I'M GONNA NEED A MOMENT
TO THINK ABOUT THIS.

14:45.319 --> 14:48.539
WHEN RYAN MENTIONED
EXORCISM, I THOUGHT "CRAZY,"

14:48.583 --> 14:50.454
BUT IT COULD BE
A GOOD WAY TO GO.

14:50.498 --> 14:53.588
UNFORTUNATELY, TAOIST EXORCISM
REQUIRES A PRIEST,

14:53.631 --> 14:56.286
AND CATHOLIC EXORCISM NEEDS
THE APPROVAL OF THE ARCHDIOCESE,

14:56.330 --> 14:57.897
WHICH COULD TAKE MONTHS.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.594
MIGHT BE SOMETHING SIMPLER.

15:00.987 --> 15:04.468
SALEM WITCH TRIALS.

15:04.512 --> 15:07.776
UH, "THESE UNIQUE CANDLES
WERE BLESSED DURING THE TRIALS

15:07.819 --> 15:10.257
TO EXPEL EVIL FEMALE
SPIRITS FROM WOMEN."

15:10.300 --> 15:12.563
MAGIC CANDLES.
OK, DID THEY WORK?

15:12.607 --> 15:15.044
NO, NOT IN SALEM.
THESE WOMEN WERE FALSELY ACCUSED.

15:15.088 --> 15:17.612
THE CANDLES WERE USED
SUCCESSFULLY LATER IN HISTORY.

15:17.655 --> 15:19.483
THE BEST PART?
"THE CANDLE'S RITUAL

15:19.527 --> 15:21.398
"CAN BE PERFORMED
BY LAYPEOPLE,

15:21.442 --> 15:24.227
IDEALLY BY THOSE CLOSE
TO THE INFECTED HOST."

15:24.271 --> 15:26.577
NO MONKS, NO PRIEST,
NO WAIT LIST?

15:26.621 --> 15:28.144
IT SOUNDS
GOOD TO ME.

15:28.188 --> 15:29.319
YEAH, BUT HOW DO WE
GET OUR HANDS ON ONE?

15:29.363 --> 15:31.539
ON IT.

15:40.113 --> 15:41.505
I GOT SOMETHING.

15:41.549 --> 15:43.507
ONLY ONE OF THE ORIGINAL
CANDLES SURVIVED

15:43.551 --> 15:45.161
INTO THE 20th CENTURY.

15:45.205 --> 15:47.294
IT WAS KEPT IN THE MUSEUM
OF THE BLAVATSKY SOCIETY,

15:47.337 --> 15:49.774
A 1920s SPIRITUALIST ORDER.

15:49.818 --> 15:51.428
OH.

15:51.472 --> 15:52.603
WHAT?

15:52.647 --> 15:54.170
IT WAS STOLEN YEARS AGO.

15:54.214 --> 15:56.868
ANY NEWS REPORTS
ABOUT THE THEFT?

15:56.912 --> 16:00.350
HMM, THIS ARTICLE SAYS THE CANDLE
WAS THE ONLY THING STOLEN THAT DAY.

16:00.394 --> 16:02.178
THREE MEN SHOWED UP
DRESSED AS PLUMBERS,

16:02.222 --> 16:04.137
TRICKED THEIR WAY IN,
AND STOLE THE CANDLE.

16:04.180 --> 16:05.181
HUH.

16:05.225 --> 16:07.314
WHAT?

16:07.357 --> 16:09.533
WHEN MY DAD AND I STOLE
THAT PAINTING FROM THE ASSISI CLUB,

16:09.577 --> 16:11.535
WE CONNED OUR WAY IN BY
DRESSING AS REPAIRMEN.

16:11.579 --> 16:13.102
THAT'S KIND OF
A SIGNATURE MOVE.

16:13.146 --> 16:15.539
OF THE WAN ZAI.

16:15.583 --> 16:17.193
YUP.
KEEPING MYSTICAL POWERFUL OBJECTS OUT OF THE WRONG HANDS,

16:17.237 --> 16:18.716
THAT'S BASICALLY
THEIR M.O.

16:18.760 --> 16:19.891
THEY MIGHT HAVE IT.

16:19.935 --> 16:22.416
TIME TO CALL
THE WAN ZAI.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.028
BO.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.248
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

16:33.949 --> 16:37.083
BO, STOP, PLEASE.

16:40.608 --> 16:42.349
SO THAT WAS HENRY.

16:42.392 --> 16:44.220
YEAH.

16:44.264 --> 16:45.830
LOOK, I HATE TEXTING
ABOUT REAL STUFF,

16:45.874 --> 16:47.223
SO I CAME TO FIND YOU
IN PERSON.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.398
IT WAS MY MISTAKE.

16:48.442 --> 16:50.183
HE'S JUST HELPING ME.

16:50.226 --> 16:52.228
WITH WHAT, YOUR OTHER
FRIEND'S CRISIS?

16:52.272 --> 16:53.751
YEAH.

16:53.795 --> 16:56.058
THAT'S IT? THAT'S
ALL I GET TO KNOW?

16:56.102 --> 16:58.756
NICKY,

16:58.800 --> 17:01.585
I LIKE YOU A LOT,

17:01.629 --> 17:04.327
BUT I'M REALIZING...

17:04.371 --> 17:06.547
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
YOU AT ALL,

17:06.590 --> 17:08.157
AND I'M STARTING TO THINK
THAT'S A CHOICE THAT YOU'RE MAKING.

17:08.201 --> 17:09.724
BO, I--

17:09.767 --> 17:11.552
ALL I HAVE TO
GO OFF OF IS MY GUT,

17:11.595 --> 17:14.337
AND MY GUT'S TELLING
ME THAT YOU'RE NOT AVAILABLE,

17:14.381 --> 17:15.860
NOT REALLY.

17:15.904 --> 17:17.775
NOT NOW.

17:20.822 --> 17:24.043
FOR SOME REASON, YOU
CAN'T SAY IT, SO I WILL.

17:24.086 --> 17:26.132
THIS ISN'T WORKING.

17:35.837 --> 17:37.795
GOT IT.
WE'LL SEE YOU THERE.

17:40.798 --> 17:42.757
SORRY.

17:42.800 --> 17:46.065
NO, IT'S OK. IT'S
NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

17:46.108 --> 17:48.110
THAT WAS YUEN.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.459
THE WAN ZAI HAVE
THE CANDLE.

17:49.503 --> 17:50.982
THEY'VE AGREED TO
GIVE IT TO US.

17:51.026 --> 17:54.116
AFTER EVERYTHING
THEY DID TO GET IT?

17:54.160 --> 17:56.423
YOU OFFERED THEM SOMETHING.

17:56.466 --> 17:57.989
WELL, APPARENTLY,
THE WAN ZAI CAUGHT WIND

17:58.033 --> 17:59.643
OF MY RECENT MISADVENTURES.

18:01.341 --> 18:03.212
THE CANDLE
FOR THE COMPASS.

18:03.256 --> 18:05.214
BUT, HENRY, YOU ARE
THE COMPASS.

18:05.258 --> 18:07.782
YEAH, BUT THEY
DON'T KNOW THAT.

18:12.874 --> 18:14.919
HI.

18:14.963 --> 18:16.921
YOUR DAUGHTER?

18:16.965 --> 18:18.967
YEAH. GABBY.

18:19.010 --> 18:22.753
IT'S AN OLD PICTURE OF HER.
SHE'S 12 NOW, GOING ON 22.

18:24.146 --> 18:26.453
I REMEMBER THAT AGE.

18:26.496 --> 18:29.847
I KEPT MY KIDS
ON A VERY TIGHT LEASH

18:29.891 --> 18:32.807
UNTIL I REALIZED THEY
NEEDED ROOM TO GROW

18:32.850 --> 18:36.158
TO MAKE MISTAKES.

18:36.202 --> 18:40.162
CARRIE, LAST YEAR WAS THE
BEST YEAR IN MY CREATIVE LIFE.

18:40.206 --> 18:42.773
WE TOOK SOME REAL RISKS
IN THIS KITCHEN.

18:42.817 --> 18:46.821
SOME PAID OFF
AND SOME FAILED.

18:46.864 --> 18:48.692
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SEBASTIAN.

18:48.736 --> 18:51.173
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE BOTH OF US.

18:51.217 --> 18:54.698
THAT LESSON, IT DOESN'T
JUST APPLY TO KIDS.

18:54.742 --> 18:56.787
AND I RESPECT THAT,
MEI-LI.

18:56.831 --> 18:59.703
I KNOW WHAT SEBASTIAN
THINKS ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

18:59.747 --> 19:04.360
BUT OUR BOSSES INVESTED
IN A CHINESE FOOD RESTAURANT.

19:04.404 --> 19:07.189
FUSION ELEMENTS ON THE
MENU COULD HURT THE BRAND.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.060
I UNDERSTAND, CARRIE,

19:09.104 --> 19:12.063
BUT I HAVE TO STAY TRUE
TO MY KITCHEN,

19:12.107 --> 19:15.458
AND THIS IS MY KITCHEN.

19:15.502 --> 19:18.809
PANCIT CAN BE
A SPECIAL ON THE MENU,

19:18.853 --> 19:22.248
BUT IT WILL BE ON THE MENU.

19:23.553 --> 19:25.076
UNDERSTOOD.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.078
I'LL DO MY BEST TO
SELL IT TO CORPORATE.

19:27.122 --> 19:29.124
THANK YOU.

19:36.740 --> 19:39.047
SUCCESS.

19:39.090 --> 19:42.050
SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE
FROM FANCY JOHN'S PAWN SHOP.

19:42.093 --> 19:44.661
HOW DID YOU GET MR. FANCY
TO HAND OVER THE FOOTAGE?

19:44.705 --> 19:46.576
I BRIBED HIM
WITH COOKIES.

19:46.620 --> 19:50.058
HE USED TO BE
A REGULAR AT THE RESTAURANT.

19:50.101 --> 19:53.192
BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL, MY
CHEERLEADING SQUAD HAD A BAKE SALE.

19:53.235 --> 19:54.758
HE WAS SO IN
LOVE WITH MY CHOCOLATE-CHIP COOKIES,

19:54.802 --> 19:56.760
HE BOUGHT THE ENTIRE INVENTORY.

19:56.804 --> 19:58.240
PAID FOR THE SQUAD'S
NEW POM POMS.

19:58.284 --> 20:01.678
OOH, AND THERE'S ANTHONY.

20:01.722 --> 20:03.550
WAIT. SLOW DOWN.

20:03.593 --> 20:05.595
YOU SEE THAT?

20:05.639 --> 20:10.121
YEAH.
THE THIEF LOOKS PRETTY FOCUSED ON GETTING THAT BRIEFCASE.

20:10.165 --> 20:12.123
DO YOU THINK THIS
COULD HAVE BEEN TARGETED?

20:12.167 --> 20:15.823
IF THE OTHER CAMPAIGN KNEW
ANTHONY HAD RESEARCH ON HIM.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.697
UGH. NO LICENSE PLATE.

20:20.741 --> 20:23.613
YEAH. BUT LOOK.

20:23.657 --> 20:25.093
RIGHT THERE,
ON THE SIDE.

20:25.136 --> 20:26.529
A RENTAL STICKER.

20:26.573 --> 20:28.096
WE CAN TRACK
THE THIEF'S CAR

20:28.139 --> 20:29.663
THROUGH
THE RENTAL COMPANY.

20:31.621 --> 20:33.971
HOW WAS THAILAND?

20:34.015 --> 20:36.278
MUGGY.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.367
HOW DID YOU KNOW
ABOUT MY TRAVELS?

20:38.411 --> 20:41.805
I DIDN'T UNTIL ZARCO
STARTED FOLLOWING YOU.

20:41.849 --> 20:44.155
WE KEEP TABS ON HIM.

20:44.199 --> 20:46.245
YOU BROUGHT THE COMPASS?

21:06.047 --> 21:07.744
THE SALEM CANDLE.

21:07.788 --> 21:10.181
ONLY ONE LEFT
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

21:10.225 --> 21:12.662
POWERFUL MAGIC.

21:12.706 --> 21:14.882
I NEED TO KNOW HOW
YOU INTEND TO USE IT.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.146
IT'S FOR A FRIEND.

21:18.189 --> 21:19.321
POSSESSION?

21:19.365 --> 21:20.757
OF A KIND.

21:20.801 --> 21:24.761
SOMETHING, SOMEONE
HAS TAKEN A HOLD OF HER.

21:24.805 --> 21:26.546
WE'RE HOPING THE CANDLE
WILL FREE HER.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.811
SHALL WE?

21:41.648 --> 21:43.693
A PLEASURE DOING
BUSINESS WITH YOU.

21:45.565 --> 21:47.349
NICE TRY.

21:47.393 --> 21:51.092
I SAID, I WANTED
THE COMPASS.

21:55.052 --> 21:57.490
ALL RIGHT. THANKS. BYE.

21:57.533 --> 21:58.708
WHAT DID NADIA SAY?

21:58.752 --> 21:59.970
GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS.

22:00.014 --> 22:01.450
THE CAR TURNED UP ABANDONED

22:01.494 --> 22:03.060
IN A PARKING GARAGE
THIS MORNING.

22:03.104 --> 22:04.671
IT WAS RETURNED TO
THE RENTAL COMPANY,

22:04.714 --> 22:06.455
BUT IT WAS RENTED
UNDER A FAKE NAME,

22:06.499 --> 22:07.891
SO NO WAY TO TRACK
THE THIEF.

22:07.935 --> 22:09.371
GOOD NEWS?

22:09.415 --> 22:10.981
WELL, THE WALLET
AND WATCH ARE GONE,

22:11.025 --> 22:12.374
BUT THE BRIEFCASE
WAS IN THE BACKSEAT

22:12.418 --> 22:14.898
AND, BY THE LOOKS OF
THINGS, UNTOUCHED.

22:14.942 --> 22:17.727
SO AT LEAST ANTHONY WILL GET
HIS BRIEFCASE AND HIS RESEARCH BACK.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.860
I'LL ARRANGE FOR HIM TO
PICK IT UP FROM EVIDENCE.

22:19.903 --> 22:22.863
I'LL CALL BABA
WITH THE GOOD NEWS.

22:22.906 --> 22:25.474
UM...

22:25.518 --> 22:27.389
CAN I SAY IT?

22:27.433 --> 22:29.391
YOU CAN SAY IT.

22:29.435 --> 22:32.394
CASE CLOSED!

22:34.918 --> 22:36.920
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

22:36.964 --> 22:39.053
WHEN YOU STOLE THE
LAI-TAANG BOW-RAAN IN ICELAND,

22:39.096 --> 22:40.750
YOU CAME BACK UP
ON OUR RADAR.

22:40.794 --> 22:42.752
SUDDENLY, YOUR
FATHER'S OBSESSION

22:42.796 --> 22:44.754
WITH PROTECTING YOU
MADE SENSE.

22:44.798 --> 22:48.062
I THOUGHT, "COULD HENRY
BE THE COMPASS BEARER?

22:48.105 --> 22:50.064
COULD HE HAVE BEEN
TRANSFORMED BY GENESIS?"

22:50.107 --> 22:51.587
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

22:51.631 --> 22:55.591
THE CANDLE IS YOURS

22:55.635 --> 22:58.942
THE COMPASS IS SAID TO
LOCATE ENERGY, MAGIC.

22:58.986 --> 23:01.684
THERE ARE A GREAT MANY
ARTIFACTS THAT THE WAN ZAI

23:01.728 --> 23:04.078
ARE STILL
SEARCHING FOR.

23:04.121 --> 23:07.298
ONE DAY, I'LL CALL
IN A FAVOR.

23:07.342 --> 23:10.737
YOUR NEW GIFT WILL
BE INVALUABLE TO OUR MISSION.

23:10.780 --> 23:12.652
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

23:16.612 --> 23:18.005
DEAL.

23:21.487 --> 23:22.836
WAIT.

23:27.014 --> 23:29.320
YOU'LL NEED INSTRUCTIONS.

23:29.364 --> 23:32.454
WITHOUT THESE, YOU'RE
JUST MELTING WAX.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.630
THIS ISN'T YOUR
TYPICAL EXORCISM.

23:34.674 --> 23:36.632
YOU WON'T BE THE ONES
FREEING YOUR FRIEND.

23:36.676 --> 23:40.549
IT'S MORE OF
A SELF-EXORCISM.

23:40.593 --> 23:44.379
SHE'LL FACE
HER POSSESSOR ALONE.

23:49.689 --> 23:53.649
THIS RITUAL ALLOWS THE HOST
TO GO BELOW THE SURFACE

23:53.693 --> 23:55.303
AND DRAW THE SPIRIT OUT.

23:55.346 --> 23:57.174
IF IT WORKS,

23:57.218 --> 24:01.352
SOMEHOW IT'LL LET YOU
FACE XIAO...ALONE.

24:02.615 --> 24:04.921
BUT, SHIFU...

24:06.532 --> 24:10.666
TAKING ON XIAO?
YOU'RE ALREADY SO WEAK.

24:10.710 --> 24:13.539
I WILL ONLY GET WEAKER.

24:15.236 --> 24:17.499
EVER SINCE I RETURNED,

24:17.543 --> 24:21.329
I HAVE FELT A PRESENCE,

24:21.372 --> 24:25.333
A DARKNESS CLOUDING
MY MIND.

24:25.376 --> 24:27.683
WHEN I BROKE THE PENDANT,

24:27.727 --> 24:30.381
I CONVINCED MYSELF
I WAS BETTER,

24:30.425 --> 24:33.950
BUT THIS RAGE WITHIN REMAINED.

24:33.994 --> 24:40.391
NOW I KNOW
THAT ANGER IS XIAO'S.

24:40.435 --> 24:45.484
I WILL DO ANYTHING
TO GET HER OUT.

25:25.567 --> 25:27.656
HEY.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.745
JUST AS WE THOUGHT.

25:29.789 --> 25:32.618
YOU'RE STRONG
BUT NOT TOO BRIGHT.

25:47.328 --> 25:49.373
THANKS FOR COMING.

25:49.417 --> 25:51.593
WE NEED AN EXTRA HAND, AND
RYAN HAS A SHIFT AT THE E.R.

25:51.637 --> 25:54.074
YEAH. OF COURSE.

25:54.117 --> 25:55.945
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

25:55.989 --> 25:57.904
WE START THE RITUAL.

26:02.996 --> 26:05.476
"WE PREPARE THIS SPACE.

26:05.520 --> 26:10.656
AS THE HOST TAKES POSITION
AND READIES THEIR MIND..."

26:12.440 --> 26:15.443
"WE SURROUND HER,
READY TO SET HER FREE."

26:18.838 --> 26:20.317
HERE WE GO.

27:26.732 --> 27:29.822
YOU THINK BECAUSE
I CAN'T TAKE YOUR SOUL,

27:29.865 --> 27:32.781
I CAN'T TAKE
YOUR LIFE? HEH.

27:32.825 --> 27:34.304
THIS KNIFE STILL CUTS.

27:34.348 --> 27:36.393
THEN SHOW ME.

27:42.269 --> 27:44.053
YOU MISSED.

27:44.097 --> 27:45.707
I'VE GOT ALL NIGHT.

27:45.751 --> 27:49.363
I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO KILL THE LIVING.

27:49.406 --> 27:52.235
I CAME HERE FOR THEM--
THE SPIRITS.

27:52.279 --> 27:53.802
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

27:53.846 --> 27:56.022
YOU'RE NOT GETTING
OUT OF THIS CAVE,

27:56.065 --> 27:57.588
NOT ALIVE.

27:57.632 --> 27:59.503
IS THAT SO?

27:59.547 --> 28:00.591
HYAH!

28:06.423 --> 28:07.947
NO.

28:10.210 --> 28:13.561
I GAVE YOU YOUR LIFE BACK.

28:13.604 --> 28:16.999
I GAVE YOU A BODY.

28:17.043 --> 28:21.482
AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
WITH THAT GIFT?

28:29.403 --> 28:30.926
UH, SHOULD WE STOP?

28:32.406 --> 28:34.887
SHIFU? SHIFU!

28:36.453 --> 28:38.586
DO YOU EVEN
WANT TO LIVE, HMM?

28:38.629 --> 28:41.589
I NEEDED TIME TO BUILD
MY STRENGTH BACK,

28:41.632 --> 28:43.199
TO TAKE YOU OVER,

28:43.243 --> 28:45.245
BUT YOU'VE COME TO ME.

28:45.288 --> 28:47.726
YOU'VE MADE IT EASY.

28:49.989 --> 28:52.948
ALL I NEED TO DO
IS DEFEAT YOU HERE,

28:52.992 --> 28:54.645
AND MY WORK
WILL BE DONE.

28:54.689 --> 28:58.171
I WILL SUBSUME
YOU COMPLETELY.

29:00.826 --> 29:03.742
IT'S QUIET NOW.
MAYBE SHE DID IT.

29:09.791 --> 29:11.837
HE'S BACK.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.156
THAT'S ENOUGH!
LEAVE THEM ALONE.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.202
FIGHT ME!

29:33.728 --> 29:36.165
TAKE HIM!

29:36.209 --> 29:37.297
NO!

30:01.234 --> 30:04.367
DIDN'T YOU WONDER WHERE
I'M GETTING MY STRENGTH?

30:04.411 --> 30:06.108
I HAVE A FRIEND
ON THE OUTSIDE

30:06.152 --> 30:08.197
REAPING SOULS OF
THE BLOODLINE,

30:08.241 --> 30:11.548
FEEDING ME,
MAKING ME STRONGER.

30:14.769 --> 30:20.383
UH, NICKY?
HENRY? HENRY? HENRY?

30:21.515 --> 30:23.517
HENRY!

30:23.560 --> 30:26.737
IT WAS ALWAYS GOING
TO END THIS WAY.

30:35.268 --> 30:37.052
SIMON!

30:57.377 --> 31:00.554
YOU HAVE BEEN VERY
USEFUL TO ME, SHIFU,

31:00.597 --> 31:03.209
AND FOR THAT,
I THANK YOU.

31:03.252 --> 31:05.776
HENRY,
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

31:05.820 --> 31:07.691
I DON'T KNOW.

31:07.735 --> 31:09.258
I SAW SOMETHING...

31:10.825 --> 31:12.783
A LIGHT.

31:12.827 --> 31:14.742
SOMEONE IS SPYING
ON ME.

31:19.660 --> 31:20.748
SILENCE.

31:24.447 --> 31:26.406
LET HER GO, XIAO.

31:29.061 --> 31:32.542
I'M ALMOST DONE
WITH HER, CHILD.

31:32.586 --> 31:35.589
WE'LL HAVE PLENTY
OF TIME FOR THIS.

31:42.422 --> 31:45.120
THE PAIN WILL BE OVER
SOON, PEI-LING.

31:45.164 --> 31:47.470
I'LL MAKE THIS QUICK.

31:49.516 --> 31:52.388
PEI-LING:
I UNDERSTAND NOW.

31:52.432 --> 31:56.131
MY MIND IS LIKE A CAGE,

31:56.175 --> 32:00.135
A CAGE LIKE THE ONE
YOU DIED IN.

32:00.179 --> 32:03.095
IT MUST HAVE BEEN UNBEARABLE,

32:03.138 --> 32:05.662
TRAPPED IN THE DARK,

32:05.706 --> 32:08.056
BETRAYED BY
THE EMPEROR.

32:08.100 --> 32:12.060
YOU USED ME TO ESCAPE
YOUR WORLD

32:12.104 --> 32:16.456
BUT FOUND YOURSELF
TRAPPED ONCE AGAIN.

32:16.499 --> 32:19.850
I THOUGHT THE POISON
I FELT WAS YOUR ANGER.

32:19.894 --> 32:24.855
I KNOW NOW THAT
WAS NOT ANGER.

32:28.033 --> 32:31.079
IT WAS FEAR.

32:31.123 --> 32:33.473
I AM SORRY, XIAO.

32:33.516 --> 32:35.997
WHAT COULD YOU
BE SORRY FOR?

32:37.216 --> 32:38.913
FOR THIS.

32:41.046 --> 32:43.309
NO, NO.

32:43.352 --> 32:45.354
HOW?!

32:45.398 --> 32:50.359
MY MIND, MY RULES.

33:04.547 --> 33:07.724
SHIFU, IS IT YOU?

33:10.771 --> 33:13.904
YES. YES, NICKY.

33:21.695 --> 33:23.175
YOU OK?

33:24.785 --> 33:28.615
I, UH, I DON'T KNOW.

33:30.269 --> 33:32.532
I THINK THAT RITUAL
TRIGGERED MY POWER.

33:32.575 --> 33:35.056
I FELT THIS ENERGY
COMING INTO THE ROOM.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.840
IT--IT TOOK
A HOLD OF ME.

33:36.884 --> 33:41.497
IT'S LIKE I WAS HERE,
BUT I WAS SOMEWHERE ELSE, TOO.

33:41.541 --> 33:43.543
ANOTHER WORLD,

33:43.586 --> 33:45.414
A WASTELAND.

33:45.458 --> 33:48.069
THERE WAS A MAN.
HE HAD TWO BLADES.

33:48.113 --> 33:49.853
HE WAS...

33:49.897 --> 33:52.943
HE WAS KILLING PEOPLE.

33:52.987 --> 33:55.598
IT'S LIKE HE WAS
TAKING THEIR ENERGY.

33:55.642 --> 33:57.600
YOU SAW IT, TOO?

33:57.644 --> 34:01.909
THE LIGHT.
XIAO WAS CONSUMING IT,

34:01.952 --> 34:04.694
FEEDING ON IT.

34:04.738 --> 34:09.221
SHE SAID IT WAS THE SOULS
OF THE BLOODLINES.

34:09.264 --> 34:11.875
THAT IS HOW SHE HAS
BEEN GETTING STRONGER.

34:11.919 --> 34:14.095
THAT'S WHY SHE
ATTACKED YOU.

34:14.139 --> 34:16.097
SHE DIDN'T WANT US
TO KNOW.

34:16.141 --> 34:19.231
WHAT I SAW, WHAT I FELT...

34:21.494 --> 34:23.931
I THINK I NEED SOME TIME.

34:23.974 --> 34:26.412
OF COURSE.

34:26.455 --> 34:28.979
THANK YOU, HENRY.

34:36.248 --> 34:38.119
I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME.

34:45.779 --> 34:47.955
HOW DID YOU DO IT?

34:47.998 --> 34:49.870
HOW DID YOU BEAT HER?

34:51.828 --> 34:54.918
I FOUND HER FEAR,

34:54.962 --> 34:58.139
AND I TURNED IT
AGAINST HER.

35:01.360 --> 35:05.015
I HAD STRUGGLED FOR SO LONG.

35:05.059 --> 35:07.670
I HAD TO STOP HIDING,

35:07.714 --> 35:10.673
BUT IT IS NOT OVER.

35:10.717 --> 35:14.677
SHE IS STRONGER THAN EVER,

35:14.721 --> 35:18.899
BUT SHE IS CONTAINED.

35:31.346 --> 35:34.001
HEARD PANCIT'S STAYING
ON THE MENU.

35:34.044 --> 35:36.656
THANK YOU, CHEF,
FOR HAVING MY BACK.

35:37.918 --> 35:43.097
SEBASTIAN, I NEED YOU
TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME.

35:44.185 --> 35:46.361
BE KIND TO HER.

35:46.405 --> 35:48.058
CARRIE'S A PART OF
THE TEAM, TOO.

35:48.102 --> 35:50.278
IT'S A BIG CHANGE
FOR THE BOTH OF US,

35:50.322 --> 35:51.845
BUT SHE IS
THE MAIN REASON

35:51.888 --> 35:53.455
WHY WE'RE ABLE
TO DO THIS,

35:53.499 --> 35:55.153
WHAT WE LOVE--

35:55.196 --> 35:58.330
WORKING, CREATING, COOKING.

36:00.027 --> 36:02.203
AND I NEED YOU
TO SHOW HER RESPECT,

36:02.247 --> 36:06.512
THE SAME RESPECT YOU
SHOW ME.

36:06.555 --> 36:10.124
OF COURSE, CHEF.
WHATEVER YOU NEED.

36:18.524 --> 36:21.744
ANTHONY, GOT YOUR BRIEFCASE
BACK FROM THE POLICE.

36:21.788 --> 36:23.311
- HEY, JIN, ABOUT TO START.
- HERE YOU GO.

36:23.355 --> 36:25.095
OUR PLEASURE.

36:25.139 --> 36:26.184
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS
TO ME, AND THANK ALTHEA.

36:26.227 --> 36:27.402
YOU GOT IT.

36:40.546 --> 36:41.895
SOMETHING MISSING?

36:41.938 --> 36:45.159
NO. NO. ALL GOOD.

36:47.422 --> 36:48.554
THANKS AGAIN.

37:15.798 --> 37:18.279
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

37:43.130 --> 37:45.915
THAT'S WHY
COMMUNITY OUTREACH IS CRITICAL.

37:45.959 --> 37:49.005
I THINK THE PEOPLE OF
CHINATOWN DESERVE TO BE HEARD.

37:49.049 --> 37:52.182
RECENTLY, YOUR OPPONENT
HAS MADE CLAIMS

37:52.226 --> 37:54.489
THAT YOU ARE
SOFT ON CRIME.

37:54.533 --> 37:57.013
AND TO JUDGE FROM
YOUR RECENT POLLING,

37:57.057 --> 37:59.277
MANY OF YOUR
CONSTITUENTS AGREE.

37:59.320 --> 38:01.322
IN PARTICULAR,
SHE'S CRITICIZED

38:01.366 --> 38:04.194
YOUR OPPOSITION
TO ORDINANCE 11.

38:04.238 --> 38:06.588
I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE
A FULL CONVERSATION

38:06.632 --> 38:08.460
ABOUT THE ISSUES INVOLVED

38:08.503 --> 38:11.680
IN OUTSOURCING POLICE
WORK TO PRIVATE SECURITY.

38:11.724 --> 38:14.117
HOWEVER, PART OF
BEING AN ELECTED REPRESENTATIVE

38:14.161 --> 38:16.032
IS KNOWING TO ADMIT
WHEN YOU WERE WRONG.

38:20.907 --> 38:25.259
THE OTHER NIGHT,
I WAS ATTACKED.

38:26.913 --> 38:30.177
I WAS ROBBED
AT KNIFEPOINT.

38:32.919 --> 38:36.966
I NOW UNDERSTAND
THE FEAR

38:37.010 --> 38:40.796
THAT SO MANY PEOPLE IN
MY DISTRICT HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH.

38:40.840 --> 38:43.538
NO ONE SHOULD EVER
HAVE TO EXPERIENCE

38:43.582 --> 38:45.453
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

38:45.497 --> 38:49.762
THE PEOPLE OF CHINATOWN
DESERVE TO BE SAFE.

38:51.677 --> 38:53.896
THAT'S WHY I'M
CHANGING MY VOTE.

38:58.292 --> 39:01.556
I WILL VOTE YES
ON ORDINANCE 11.

39:11.697 --> 39:12.915
NICKY.

39:12.959 --> 39:14.569
YOU WERE RIGHT.

39:14.613 --> 39:16.876
I MADE A CHOICE TO
KEEP YOU IN THE DARK.

39:16.919 --> 39:19.357
EVEN WHEN I SAW WHAT IT
WAS DOING TO US,

39:19.400 --> 39:21.663
I WANTED TO KEEP IT
THAT WAY, TO KEEP HIDING.

39:21.707 --> 39:24.753
I WAS AFRAID WHAT
YOU'D THINK,

39:24.797 --> 39:27.408
THAT--THAT I'D SCARE YOU OFF,
BUT THAT ISN'T FAIR TO YOU.

39:29.105 --> 39:32.848
YOU CAUGHT ME OFF-GUARD.

39:32.892 --> 39:36.417
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO FEEL
THIS WAY ABOUT SOMEONE

39:36.461 --> 39:39.942
THIS FAST, THIS HARD.

39:39.986 --> 39:43.511
BUT WE CAN'T BE TOGETHER
IF WE DON'T UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER.

39:43.555 --> 39:46.775
SO IF IT'S NOT TOO LATE,

39:46.819 --> 39:49.691
IF YOU STILL WANT THIS,
I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING.

39:49.735 --> 39:52.172
I'M READY. I WILL--

40:46.139 --> 40:48.184
ZHILAN.

41:42.848 --> 41:44.371
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.

41:44.414 --> 41:45.764
NICE SHOT, MOM!
